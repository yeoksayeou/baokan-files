Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 18th: Soviet Embassy in Indonesia Economic Cooperation Affairs Counselor Kolibalov, at the request of Indonesian reporters today, introduced to them some details of the Indonesian projects to be built with Soviet assistance.

The Soviet Union will provide designs, experts, building materials and production equipment to build all the projects funded by the Soviet Union's $117.5 million loan.

Kolibalov said that the construction of two steel plants, each with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel, will enable Indonesia to produce its own steel and reduce steel imports. It is reported that since Indonesia does not have its own steel industry, it exports large amounts of scrap iron to Japan every year.

He said that the construction of two mechanized rice farms, each covering 10,000 hectares, and a phosphate fertilizer plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of fertilizer, will help increase Indonesia's rice production. In addition, these two rice farms will be able to help the surrounding 100,000 hectares of farmland.

He said that the technical college planned to be built in Ambon will provide Indonesia with courses on shipbuilding and oceanography, so that Indonesia can train its own shipbuilding engineers needed to develop maritime transport in this island nation, as well as train experts to develop Indonesia's rich fishery resources.

Kolibalov said that the stadium planned to be built in Jakarta and the 700-kilometer road to be built in Kalimantan will also greatly contribute to the development of Indonesian sports, culture and economy. He said that the Soviet Union is ready to provide all necessary assistance immediately after signing the specific contracts for the implementation of these construction projects.

　　苏联帮助印度尼西亚建设
　　将兴建钢铁厂机械化农场等多项工程
    新华社雅加达18日电　苏联驻印度尼西亚大使馆负责经济合作事务参赞科利巴洛夫今天应印度尼西亚记者的要求，向他们介绍了将在苏联帮助下建造的印度尼西亚工程的一些情况。
    苏联将提供设计、专家、建筑材料和生产设备，来建造由苏联提供一亿一千七百五十万美元贷款资助建造的所有工程。
    科利巴洛夫说，建造年产钢各五万吨的两个钢铁厂将使印度尼西亚能够自己生产钢，并且减少钢的进口。据报道，由于印度尼西亚没有自己的钢铁工业，它每年向日本输出大量废铁。
    他说，建造两个各占一万公顷地的机械化稻米农场和一座年产十万吨肥料的磷肥厂，将有助于增加印度尼西亚的大米产量。此外，这两个稻米农场将能够帮助它们周围的共有十万公顷的农田。
    他说，计划在安汶修建的一座工艺学院将为印度尼西亚提供关于造船和海洋学的课程，以便使印度尼西亚能够为它自己训练发展这个岛国海上交通所需要的造船工程师，以及训练开发印度尼西亚丰富的渔业资源的专家。
    科利巴洛夫说，计划在雅加达修建的体育场和在加里曼丹修建的七百公里的公路，也将大大地有助于印度尼西亚体育、文化和经济的发展。他说，苏联准备在签订关于执行兴建这些工程的具体合同之后立即提供所需要的一切援助。
