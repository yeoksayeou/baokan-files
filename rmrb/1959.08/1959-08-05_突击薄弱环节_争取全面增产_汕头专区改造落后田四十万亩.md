    Seize Weak Links, Strive for Comprehensive Production Increase
    Shantou Prefecture Transforms 400,000 Mu of Backward Fields

    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, August 4) Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, is vigorously transforming backward fields in its late rice crop production to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the late season. According to statistics, from the beginning of the summer harvest to the transplanting stage, various counties seized the gap and mobilized nearly one million people to fight against backward fields, transforming a total of 400,000 mu of backward fields. In these backward fields, large amounts of farmyard manure were generally applied, soil was improved by adding sand and soil, and the drainage and irrigation systems were also improved. Many remote mountain and pit backward fields have built work sheds and dug fertilizer pits at the edge of the fields.

    Each county in this prefecture has many high-yield areas, but backward fields account for one-fifth of the prefecture's rice fields. These backward fields are mainly mountain and semi-mountain pit fields and coastal saline-alkali fields, which have always had very low yields. Although preliminary transformation has been carried out since liberation, the annual output per mu is less than 500 jin. Last year, after communization, a deep plowing and soil improvement movement was launched. Many mountain pit fields were deeply plowed and improved, and this year's early rice crop achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Generally, the output increased by 20% to 30% or even 70% to 80% compared with the same period last year, and the yield per mu was more than 100 jin to 200 jin of grain more than the same rice fields that had not been transformed.

    Based on this specific fact, the prefectural party committee and party committees at all levels educated and led the masses to carry out the movement to transform backward fields in conjunction with accumulating fertilizer, and to demand more grain from low-yield fields. Each commune and brigade transformed backward fields based on the specific conditions of each piece of land, adopting different measures. The main measures are three: First, further improve the drainage and irrigation system so that these cold and low-lying mountain pit fields, rust water fields, and coastal saline-alkali fields can change their original poor water and soil conditions through drainage and irrigation; second, plow the soil layer deeply and add sand to change the original shallow soil layer, or the phenomenon of excessive soil viscosity or excessive loose sand; third, increase the application of organic base fertilizer, such as returning rice straw to the field, applying green manure, sod mud, and livestock manure.

    In carrying out the movement to transform backward fields, many communes summarized the experience of increasing early rice production through on-site debates, unified the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses, and made the transformation of backward fields a conscious demand of the masses. Then, cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians surveyed each plot of land and formulated transformation plans and specific measures. The Gaotang Brigade of Qiandong Commune in Raoping County summarized the experience of increasing the yield per mu by more than 200 jin of this brigade’s more than ten mu of low-yield mountain pit rice fields this year after deep plowing and soil improvement last year, and calculated that the entire brigade had more than 1,100 mu of low-yield mountain pit fields. If all of them could be transformed, the late rice crop could yield more than 280,000 jin of grain, enough for the brigade’s 7,000 members to eat for a month. After this calculation, each production team in this brigade planned to transform backward fields one after another, formulated transformation measures plot by plot, marked them with numbers, completed the tasks on schedule, and immediately took action.

    In order to quickly complete the task of transforming backward fields, many communes in various counties invested in the battle to transform backward fields immediately after the summer harvest. Many brigades established headquarters for transforming backward fields, headed by the secretary of the party general branch, and cadres were assigned to specific areas to be responsible for leadership. In order to seize the time and complete the plan to transform backward fields, the members of Lianrao Brigade of Fengjiang Commune in Raoping County braved heavy rain to persist in digging ditches for drainage and clearing weeds on the edges of the fields in the mountain pit fields, and transformed more than 400 mu of backward fields in a few days.

### 突击薄弱环节　争取全面增产  汕头专区改造落后田四十万亩

    突击薄弱环节　争取全面增产
    汕头专区改造落后田四十万亩
    本报广州4日电　广东省汕头专区在晚造生产中，大力改造落后田，力争晚造全面大丰产。据统计，各县在夏收开始到插秧这段时间，抓紧空隙，出动了近百万人大战落后田，共改造了四十万亩落后田。在这些落后田里，一般都下了大量土杂肥，并加沙加土改良土壤，同时还改善了排灌体系。许多边远山坑落后田搭了工作寮，挖了田头肥坑。
    这个专区各县都有许多丰产区，但落后田占全区水稻田的五分之一。这些落后田主要是山区半山区的坑田和沿海地区的边海咸田，一向产量很低，解放后虽经初步改造，每亩年产量在五百斤以下。去年公社化后开展深翻改土运动，许多山坑田经过深翻改土，今年早造获得了空前大丰产，一般都比去年同期增产两三成到七八成，比没有经过改造的同样稻田，亩产多了一百多斤到二百斤谷。
    地委和各级党委根据这一具体事实，教育和领导群众结合积肥，开展改造落后田运动，向低产田更多要粮。各公社大队改造落后田都根据每片田的具体情况，采取不同措施。主要措施有三项：第一，进一步改善排灌系统，使这些山坑冷底田、锈水田、边海咸田，通过排灌，改变原来水土不良的面貌；第二，犁深土层，加沙改变原来土层浅薄状况，或土质过粘或松沙过多等现象；第三，增施有机质基肥，如稻草回田，下绿肥、草皮坭和家畜粪等。
    在开展改造落后田运动中，许多公社通过现场辩论总结早稻增产经验，统一干部和群众思想认识，使改造落后田成为群众的自觉要求。然后由干部、老农和技术员逐片勘察订出改造计划和具体措施。饶平县钱东公社高堂大队总结了该队今年早造十多亩山坑低产稻田，经过去年深翻改土，今年早造每亩增产二百多斤的经验，算出全队有一千一百多亩低产山坑田，如都能进行改造，晚稻就可多收二十八万多斤谷子，够全队七千社员一月的口粮。这个队的各生产队经过这么一算，都纷纷计划改造落后田，逐片逐丘订出改造措施，插下标号，定期完成任务，并立即行动起来。
    为了迅速完成改造落后田的任务，各县许多公社在夏收刚刚结束后就投入了改造落后田的战斗。许多大队成立了改造落后田指挥部，由党总支书记挂帅，干部分片包干负责领导。饶平县凤江公社联饶大队社员为了抢时间，完成改造落后田计划，曾冒着暴雨，在山坑田中坚持进行开沟排水清除田边杂草等工作，在几天内就改造了四百多亩落后田。　（陈信贤）
