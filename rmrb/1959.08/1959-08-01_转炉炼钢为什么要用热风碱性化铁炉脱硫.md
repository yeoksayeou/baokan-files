Since the Great Leap Forward, many converter workshops have been built across the country, and converter steelmaking has become an important component of China's steel industry. However, many converter workshops have not yet fully mastered the technology for making steel from high-sulfur pig iron, so the progress of converter steelmaking in terms of increasing production and improving quality is relatively slow.

Small blast furnaces can produce good iron. However, because small blast furnaces cannot temporarily obtain the same material and technical conditions as large blast furnaces, they cannot all produce pig iron of the same quality as large blast furnaces. Therefore, how to use the most reasonable and effective method to refine high-sulfur pig iron into qualified steel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.055% has become the key problem in converter steelmaking.

From a technical standpoint, there are two fundamentally different methods for making steel from high-sulfur pig iron: one is to eliminate sulfur in the cupola, using the cupola as the main desulfurization tool; the other is to eliminate sulfur in the process after the cupola, using the iron ladle and converter as the only desulfurization tools. We advocate the first desulfurization method and do not advocate the second desulfurization method.

Last winter and this spring, the Ministry of Metallurgy held two national converter steelmaking conferences in Tianjin and Shanghai, respectively. One of the main topics of the conference was to recommend the use of hot blast alkaline cupolas. Over the past six months, many production practices, especially the experience of Qingdao City, have proved that the hot blast alkaline cupola is the most effective and economical means for desulfurization in converter workshops. Under the direct leadership of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, 15 converter production units in Qingdao City have widely adopted hot blast alkaline cupolas, which has led to a new situation of high quality and high output in converter production. The production and technical effects achieved by using hot blast alkaline cupolas are as follows:

I. The hot air temperature can generally reach about 400℃;

II. The iron temperature can reach 1350 to 1410℃;

III. Using high-sulfur pig iron, the desulfurization efficiency can reach more than 80% after the hot blast alkaline cupola, saving soda ash;

IV. The melting rate is almost the same as the cold blast acidic cupola before the change;

V. The average life of the cupola can reach more than forty-eight hours. When using a double forehearth and double iron runners, the furnace age can be increased several times;

VI. The coke-to-iron ratio is one to eight.

Because the hot blast alkaline cupola can supply the converter with high-temperature, low-sulfur molten iron, the converter production is normal and smooth. The blowing time is short and the output is high, the furnace life is long and the consumption of refractory materials is low, and the consumption of pig iron and ferroalloys is low. The quality of steel is high. The indicators of advanced factories in Qingdao are:

I. The daily output of a half-ton converter can reach about 20 tons; the daily output of a one-ton converter can reach 40 to 50 tons, with a maximum of 63.89 tons;

II. The average furnace age of converters in May was 49 heats, and the highest furnace age reached 120 heats;

III. The pig iron consumption per ton of steel is less than 1,300 kilograms;

IV. The silicon iron consumption per ton of steel is 9 to 10 kilograms, and the ferromanganese consumption is 9 to 11 kilograms;

V. Judging only by sulfur, ingots that meet the first-class standard (sulfur content no more than 0.055%) account for more than 80%, the rest are second-class (sulfur content 0.055%-0.08%), and the number of third-class products is extremely small;

VI. The yield rate during rolling is as high as 91% or more.

The significance of using hot blast alkaline cupolas is not only to ensure that qualified steel can be smoothly produced from high-sulfur iron, but also to create conditions and open up broad avenues for the development of small local furnaces. After the half-ton small converters in Qingdao City adopted hot blast alkaline cupolas, it proved that half-ton converters can operate normally. High-temperature, low-sulfur molten iron is the main condition for the normal and smooth operation of half-ton alkaline converters.

To ensure the normal operation of small converters, it is also necessary to ensure high-temperature operation in a series of production processes; that is, the temperature of the iron ladle, steel ladle, and converter lining must be high and thoroughly baked. The time for converters to wait for molten iron should be shortened to the minimum, and the fluxes and ferroalloys used in converters should be preheated, etc. These tasks have been satisfactorily resolved in Qingdao City. Because Qingdao City adopted hot blast alkaline cupolas, it ensured the normal production of small converters, and enabled small blast furnaces, small converters, and small rolling mills to form a reasonable technical production process, thus providing strong evidence for the existence and development of small local iron and steel complexes.

If sulfur is eliminated in the process after the cupola, using the iron ladle and converter as the only desulfurization tools, the following consequences will occur:

I. Cold blast acidic cupolas cannot remove sulfur, but instead increase the sulfur content by about 0.05%; II. The molten iron temperature is about 50-100℃ lower than that of hot blast alkaline cupolas. In addition, soda ash ladle desulfurization will further reduce the molten iron temperature by 30-50℃; III. The converter requires multiple slagging and slag removal, the furnace temperature is low, a large amount of ferroalloys are needed to raise the temperature, and a large amount of molten iron is lost; IV. The blowing time is long, the output is low, and the furnace life is low; V. Because the blowing temperature is low, some factories also adopt the post-blowing desulfurization method, so the quality of the steel is low; VI. Because the blowing temperature is low, there are more low-temperature steel outputs, and the reject rate is high.

Maintaining a sufficiently high blowing temperature of molten iron is an important principle to ensure the smooth operation of converter blowing. The method of "eliminating sulfur in the process after the cupola" is contrary to this principle and makes converter production very abnormal. Therefore, each factory should choose the method of "eliminating sulfur in the cupola and using the cupola as the main desulfurization tool," and resolutely adopt hot blast alkaline cupolas to refine high-sulfur pig iron into good steel. This is the most effective, reasonable, and economical method.

Of course, adopting hot blast alkaline cupolas is not easy. Qingdao City encountered many difficulties when converting acidic cupolas to hot blast alkaline cupolas. However, Qingdao City, without specialized technicians and steelmaking experience, did not emphasize difficulties after encountering many setbacks. On the contrary, it overcame difficulties head-on and finally created the necessary material and technical conditions. The experience of Qingdao City has made us realize that to learn and adopt advanced experience, we must first put politics in command, rely on the masses, and have advanced guiding ideology. If we only talk about conditions and emphasize difficulties, it is not easy to promote any good experience.

What difficulties and problems will be encountered when using hot blast alkaline cupolas?

The first is the problem of furnace life, and the central link of furnace life lies in how to solve the service life of the iron runner. Because the melting zone of the cupola's high-temperature area can be used for more than a week after water cooling, the iron runner is a weak link. The correct selection of refractory materials and water cooling are prerequisites for ensuring the life of the iron runner. Qingdao City used graphite tar magnesia sand to ram the iron runner, which greatly increased the life, averaging 97 heats and reaching a maximum of 139 heats. Regions where magnesia is difficult to supply can use tar dolomite bricks or try carbon materials. In addition, the use of double iron runners and double forehearths is also a major measure to improve the life of the iron runner. Preliminary test results from Qingdao show that the life can be increased by one to several times.

The slag tap is also a weak link in the hot blast alkaline cupola. However, the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and the Puzhen Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory used small blast furnace tuyere water jackets to make slag taps, and the life can reach several months. This shows that extending the life of the taphole with frequent maintenance can be guaranteed.

Secondly, after the cupola is changed from acidic to alkaline, it undertakes the task of desulfurization, and more slag-forming materials are added, which correspondingly reduces the proportion of iron. Therefore, if no measures are taken, its melting rate will be lower than that of an acidic cupola under the same conditions. However, after Qingdao City switched to hot blast alkaline cupolas, it adopted measures such as increasing air volume, increasing air temperature, increasing the proportion of iron, using lime instead of limestone, controlling the size of raw materials, and improving burdening. The melting rate is basically the same as that of the acidic furnace before the change. It should be noted that when switching to hot blast alkaline cupolas, due to the addition of a hot blast stove, special attention should be paid to the wind pressure and air volume of the blower.

It should be admitted that we have gained preliminary experience in the production technology of hot blast alkaline cupolas, and have initially met the requirements of converter steelmaking production in terms of desulfurization, molten iron temperature, melting rate, and furnace life. However, this does not mean that we have fully mastered this cutting-edge technology in cupola furnaces, and there are still many issues that need to be further studied and improved.

In short, the experience of hot blast alkaline cupolas in Qingdao City proves that the key to desulfurization in steelmaking from high-sulfur pig iron must be the hot blast alkaline cupola to reduce the burden of desulfurization on the converter, and to create good conditions for improving the tapping temperature, reducing the consumption of raw materials, increasing the converter life, and improving quality and output. At the same time, the experience of Qingdao City also proves that the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises is completely correct, making us ideologically clear that resolutely taking the path of small local complexes is a faster, better, and more economical route for building socialism. We believe that after comprehensively promoting hot blast alkaline cupolas, the units that use high-sulfur iron will have a more reliable guarantee for the double leap forward in the quality and output of converter steel.

    转炉炼钢为什么要用热风碱性化铁炉脱硫
    冶金工业部钢铁司
    大跃进以来，全国各地兴建了许多转炉车间，转炉炼钢一跃而为我国炼钢工业中的一个重要组成部分。但是目前尚有不少转炉车间对于含硫较高的生铁炼钢在技术上还没有完全过关，以致转炉炼钢在提高产量和提高质量方面，进展还比较慢。
    小高炉是可以炼出好铁的。但是，由于目前小高炉一时不可能得到和大高炉一样的物质技术条件，还不能全部生产出和大高炉同等质量的生铁。因此，如何采用最合理最有效的方法来把含硫较高的生铁炼成含硫量不大于0.055％的合格钢，就成为目前转炉炼钢的关键问题了。
    从技术方针来说，用含硫较高的生铁炼钢有两种根本不同的方法，一种是把硫消灭在化铁炉内，用化铁炉为主要脱硫工具；一种是把硫消灭在化铁炉以后的工序，用盛铁桶与转炉为唯一的脱硫工具。我们提倡第一种脱硫方法，而不主张第二种脱硫方法。
    去冬和今春冶金部曾分别在天津和上海召开了两次全国转炉炼钢会议，会议主要内容之一就是推荐采用热风碱性化铁炉。半年来许多生产实践特别是青岛市的经验证明了热风碱性化铁炉是转炉车间中用以除硫的最有效最经济的手段。青岛市十五个转炉生产单位，在市委的直接领导下，普遍采用热风碱性化铁炉，使转炉生产迅速出现了优质高产的新局面。他们使用热风碱性化铁炉所达到的生产技术效果如下：
    一、热风温度一般可达到400℃左右；
    二、铁水温度可达到1350至1410℃；
    三、用含硫较高的生铁，经热风碱性化铁炉后，去硫效率可达80％以上，节约苏打；
    四、熔化率与未改前的冷风酸性化铁炉几乎一样；
    五、化铁炉的平均寿命可达四十八小时以上，使用双前炉双过铁道时炉龄可以成倍增加；
    六、焦铁比为一比八。
    由于热风碱性化铁炉能供给转炉以高温低硫铁水，转炉生产便正常而顺利。吹炼时间短与产量高，炉子寿命长与耐火材料消耗低，生铁与铁合金消耗低。钢的质量高。青岛市先进厂的指标是：
    一、半吨转炉的日产量可达二十吨左右；一吨转炉的日产量可达四十至五十吨，最高达到六十三点八九吨；
    二、5月份转炉炉龄平均为四十九炉，最高炉龄达一百二十炉；
    三、每吨钢的生铁消耗在一千三百公斤以下；
    四、每吨钢的矽铁消耗为九至十公斤，锰铁消耗为九至十一公斤；
    五、仅以硫一项衡量，合乎一级品（含硫不大于0.055％）的钢锭占80％以上，其余为二级品（含硫0.055％—0.08％），三级品的数量极少；
    六、在轧制过程中成材率高达91％以上。
    采用热风碱性化铁炉的意义还不只保证了用含硫较高的铁顺利炼出合格钢，而且还为小洋群炉发展创造了条件与开辟了广阔的道路，青岛市的半吨小转炉采用了热风碱性化铁炉后证明，半吨转炉完全可以正常生产，高温低硫铁水是半吨碱性转炉正常顺利生产的主要条件。
    要保证小转炉正常生产，还要在一系列的生产过程中保证高温操作；也就是铁水包、钢水包和转炉炉衬的温度都一定要高，要烘烤得透，转炉等铁水的时间应力求缩短到最低限度，转炉所用的熔剂、铁合金等都要预先加热，等等。这些工作在青岛市都得到令人满意的解决。青岛市由于采用热风碱性化铁炉后，保证了小转炉的正常生产，使小高炉、小转炉和小轧机构成了合理的技术生产过程，因而给钢铁小洋群炉的存在和发展提供了有力的证据。
    如果把硫消灭在化铁炉以后的工序，用盛铁桶与转炉为唯一的脱硫工具，则发生以下后果：
    一、冷风酸性化铁炉不能去硫，反而增加约0.05％的硫；二、铁水温度比热风碱性化铁炉还低约50—100℃，再加上苏打盛铁桶脱硫又要降低铁水温度30—50℃；三、转炉内多次造渣与扒渣，炉内温度低，需要大量铁合金提高温度并损失大量铁水；四、吹炼时间长，产量低，炉子寿命低；五、由于吹炼温度低，有的厂还采取后吹脱硫的方法，所以钢的质量低；六、由于吹炼温度低，低温出钢多，废品率高。
    铁水维持足够高的吹炼温度，是保证转炉吹炼顺行的一个重要原则，“把硫消灭在化铁炉以后的工序”，这一方法与此原则相背，使转炉生产很不正常。因此，各厂要选择“把硫消灭在化铁炉内，用化铁炉为主要脱硫工具”这一方法，坚决采用热风碱性化铁炉，把高硫生铁炼成好钢。这是最有效最合理最经济的方法。
    当然采用热风碱性化铁炉并非轻而易举的。青岛市在把酸性化铁炉改为热风碱性化铁炉时曾遇到了不少困难。然而，青岛市在没有专门的技术人员和没有炼钢经验的情况下，遇到许多挫折之后，没有强调困难，相反的却是迎头去克服困难，终于创造了必要的物质技术条件。青岛市的经验，使我们体会到学习和采用先进经验，首先要政治挂帅，要依靠群众，要有先进的指导思想，如果只讲条件，强调困难，任何好经验都是不容易推广的。
    采用热风碱性化铁炉时会遇到什么困难和问题呢？
    首先是炉龄的问题，炉龄的中心环节又在于如何解决过铁道的使用寿命。因为化铁炉高温区域的熔化带部分经用水冷后，已能使用一星期以上，而过铁道部分则是一个薄弱环节。正确的选用耐火材料和进行水冷是保证过铁道寿命的前提。青岛市采用石墨焦油镁砂打结的过铁道，寿命大为提高，平均可达九十七炉次，最高达到一百三十九炉次。镁砂供应比较困难的地区可以采用焦油白云石砖或试用炭素材料。此外，采用双过铁道和双前炉也是提高过铁道寿命的一个重大措施，从青岛初步试验结果说明可提高寿命一倍至数倍。
    出渣口也是热风碱性化铁炉的一个薄弱环节。但是戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂和浦镇机车车辆修理工厂采用小高炉风口水套作出渣口，寿命可达几个月之久。这说明，出铁口勤加维护延长寿命是可以得到保证的。
    其次，化铁炉由酸性改为碱性以后，由于担任了脱硫任务，多加了造渣料，相应地降低了铁的比例，因此，如不采取措施，它的熔化率与其他条件相同的酸性化铁炉比较是要降低一些的。但是，青岛市在改用热风碱性化铁炉后，采用增加风量、提高风温并提高铁的比例、用石灰代替石灰石、控制原料块度、改善布料等措施以后，熔化率基本上与未改前的酸性炉相同。应该引起注意的是：在改用热风碱性化铁炉时，由于增加了一个热风炉，应特别注意风机的风压和风量的问题。
    应该承认：我们在热风碱性化铁炉的生产技术方面已取得初步经验，无论在脱硫、铁水温度、熔化率以及炉龄等方面都已能初步满足转炉炼钢生产的要求。但是，这并不是说我们已经全部掌握了这一化铁炉方面的尖端技术，需要我们进一步研究和提高的问题还很多。
    总之，青岛市热风碱性化铁炉的经验证明了用含硫较高的生铁炼钢的去硫关键必须是热风碱性化铁炉给转炉减轻去硫的负担，为提高出钢温度，降低原料材料消耗，提高转炉寿命，提高质量和产量创造良好的条件。同时，青岛市的经验也证明了大中小同时并举的方针是完全正确的，使我们在思想上明确了坚决走小洋群的道路，是建设社会主义一条多快好省的路线。我们相信，采用高硫铁的单位，在全面推广热风碱性化铁炉以后，转炉钢的质量产量双跃进有了更可靠的保证。
