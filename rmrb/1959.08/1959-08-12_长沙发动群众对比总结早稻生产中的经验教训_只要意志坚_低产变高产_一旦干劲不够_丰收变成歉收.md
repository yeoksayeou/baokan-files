(Our Correspondent Hu Jian reports from Changsha on the 11th) After a large-scale bumper harvest of early rice in Changsha County, Hunan Province, the Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized the masses to conduct a concrete analysis of this year's early rice harvest, drawing lessons from experience, increasing efforts, and adding measures to strive for an even greater harvest of late autumn crops.

The county's summary of the experience of early rice bumper harvests was carried out by production teams, using small meetings for discussions and comparative summaries. Everyone presented their situation, everyone looked for reasons, debates were held at every level, and teams were ranked at every level. The results of the ranking: out of the county's twenty-six communes and one farm, twenty-four communes and one farm increased their early rice production compared to last year, one commune had the same production level, and one commune had reduced production. Out of the four hundred and fifty large teams in the county that planted early rice, three hundred and forty-six teams increased their early rice production compared to last year, accounting for 76.9%; fifty-six teams had the same production level, accounting for 12.4%; and forty-eight teams had reduced production, accounting for 10.7%.

Regardless of the ranking of early rice harvests from which level of production unit, the vast majority of production units this year have increased production and achieved bumper harvests; at the same time, there are also three situations of increased production, same production, and reduced production. When analyzing the reasons for the increase or decrease in early rice production this year, the consistent conclusion was that: the transformation from low yield to high yield, and the transformation from good harvest to poor harvest, do not completely depend on the quality of natural conditions, but the main reason lies in whether or not people's subjective initiative is fully utilized, in the leadership's determination and the masses' enthusiasm, and in whether or not people can constantly maintain a strong revolutionary fighting spirit to continuously overcome difficulties. The masses used countless vivid facts to prove this truth. The facts of Dongyang Brigade and Wangsheng Brigade in Qiaoyi Commune are a particularly clear contrast:

All three hundred and fifty-seven households of Dongyang Brigade live in the Jiangjiashan area, and one thousand two hundred and seventy-five mu of early rice fields are distributed in one hundred and eighty-six small mountain gullies. 90% are sandy fields that leak water and fertilizer, and the sunlight conditions are also very poor. The local people call it a place where "you see the bright moon in the middle of the night, and you can only see the sun at noon." This year, Zhou Yinchu, the secretary of the brigade's Party general branch, led the masses in a struggle to transform low-yield fields. In the first month of the lunar year, the mountains were covered in white snow. The general branch secretary, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members took the lead in breaking the snow and transporting green moss from behind the mountains to the fields to improve the soil. More than one thousand two hundred people were mobilized in the entire team, fifty-four flumes were dug on the mountains, twenty-three aerial cableways were erected, and more than seven hundred soil carts were mobilized. A magnificent scene of "rolling on the slopes, flying in the air, and pushing on the flat ground" appeared throughout the team. After more than a month of hard work by cadres and the masses, the team deepened the soil layer of more than one thousand mu of rice fields by two or three inches and improved the soil quality. In order to overcome the difficulty of low temperatures in the mountainous area, they opened more than one thousand small channels on the mountain to drain cold water; and they erected long ladders to cut down the weeds and miscellaneous trees on the edges of the field ridges. This not only increased the sunlight exposure to the rice fields, but also reduced the harm from mountain rats and beasts. During the early rice seedling cultivation season, they combined burning soil ash and built bonfires everywhere around the seedling fields to increase the temperature. This year, the entire brigade transplanted early rice eight days earlier than last year. Fighting hard every step of the way, the entire brigade harvested an average of five hundred and sixty jin of dried grain per mu from seven hundred and sixty-three mu of early rice, achieving a bumper harvest with an increase of 25% compared to last year.

Wangsheng Brigade, located at the foot of the mountains in a plain area, has much better natural conditions than Dongyang Brigade. This year, one thousand nine hundred and forty-three mu of early rice here only yielded an average of four hundred and sixteen and a half jin of dried grain per mu, a decrease of fourteen jin per mu compared to last year. Why is this? Recently, the Qiaoyi Commune Party Committee held a cadre meeting of more than six hundred people in the commune to mobilize the members of Wangsheng Brigade to summarize the increase in production in Dongyang Brigade and find out the reasons for the decrease in early rice production. Members posted hundreds of big-character posters, and in addition to self-criticism, they all expressed opinions on the brigade's Party general branch. The members' opinions focused on: the brigade's leading cadres did not pay close attention to production and political and ideological work and were too laissez-faire. This year, the amount of household fertilizer collected from the members was reduced by about half compared to last year, and less fertilizer was applied to the rice fields than last year, especially less refined fertilizer. During the early rice mid-cultivation and top dressing, 60% of the rice fields were only dragged by wheels without applying any fertilizer. As a result, early rice production decreased this year. After comparing, summarizing, and rectifying their ideological style, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses rebounded, and the cadres went deep into the fields to lead the masses in fighting drought and rushing to transplant late rice, and expanding the planting of late autumn crops. The entire brigade's enthusiasm for fighting drought was great and was commended by the commune.

The facts summarized by Changsha County also show that on the road to marching towards high yields and bumper harvests, we must never relax and be complacent. A slight slackening can lead to the danger of falling behind. More than twenty advanced agricultural cooperatives (now production teams) that won red flags last year experienced a decrease in early rice production this year; more than sixty agricultural cooperatives (now production teams) that were relatively backward last year had strong momentum to catch up with the advanced, and their early rice production increased significantly this year.

Ronghua Production Team of Gaoqiao Commune has good natural conditions and had an early rice yield of 709 jin and 13 liang per mu last year. After communization last year, a large reservoir was built, and the production conditions became even better. However, some cadres and the masses began to develop complacency, believing that the field base was fertile and the production conditions were good, and no matter how hard others worked, they could not catch up. When everyone relaxed, the number of people going to work decreased, the base fertilizer was also less than last year, and the work of eliminating third-class seedlings was not followed up in a timely manner. As a result, the team's early rice production decreased by 30% compared to last year.

The Bailu Production Team adjacent to them is distributed in nineteen mountain gullies, and five hundred and sixty mu of fields have one thousand nine hundred and sixty-two plots, which has always been a low-yield team in the past. They have high aspirations and great enthusiasm for transforming nature. The mountain fields are often attacked by mountain floods and sand. Last winter, they braved the accumulated snow to dig forty-three flood and sand prevention ditches along the mountains and built more than six hundred mu of flood prevention forests. Without money to buy commercial fertilizer, they organized a professional team to sit in the mountains and accumulate fertilizer. This year, the team's early rice production increased by more than 40%.

This year, the 70,000 mu of early rice in Jinggang Commune decreased by 10% compared to last year. The six production brigades with good natural conditions and year-on-year increases in production all experienced a decrease in early rice production this year; while the five production brigades with poor natural conditions and relatively backward production in the past all experienced an increase in early rice production this year. The commune Party committee believes that there is only one lesson: at any time, we must go all out and work conscientiously, and we must not have a slack and complacent mood. This spring, some cadres and the masses in production teams with a good production foundation carried the burden of being "advanced" and developed a slack mood. When the early rice was heading and flowering, the commune Party committee realized that the early rice was not growing well in places that had produced well last year. From this, the commune Party committee deeply realized that it must improve its leadership methods. It must not only grasp the backward, but also grasp the advanced; it must not only pay attention to grasping both ends, but also pay attention to leading the middle. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of the backward catching up with the advanced, and the advanced becoming even more advanced.

    长沙发动群众对比总结早稻生产中的经验教训
　　只要意志坚　低产变高产
　　一旦干劲不够　丰收变成歉收
    本报长沙11日电　记者胡坚报道：湖南省长沙县早稻大面积丰收后，中共长沙县委发动群众对今年早稻收成进行了具体分析，吸取经验教训，加干劲，加措施，争取晚秋作物更大丰收。
    这个县总结早稻丰产经验，是以生产队为单位，采取小会座谈、对比总结的方式进行的。人人摆情况，个个找原因，层层辩论，级级排队。排队结果：全县二十六个公社和一个农场中，有二十四个公社和一个农场早稻较去年增产，有一个公社平产，有一个公社减产。全县种植早稻的四百五十个大队中，早稻较去年增产的有三百四十六个大队，占76.9％；平产的有五十六个大队，占12.4％；减产的有四十八个大队，占10.7％。
    无论从哪一级生产单位的早稻收成排队情况来看，今年绝大多数生产单位都是增产的、丰收的；同时，也都有增产、平产和减产三种情况。各地在对比分析今年早稻增产减产的原因时，一致的结论是：由低产变高产，由丰收变歉收，并不完全决定于自然条件的好坏，而更主要的原因在于是否充分发挥人的主观能动性，在于领导的决心和群众的干劲，在于人们能否经常保持着旺盛的革命斗志，不断地战胜困难。群众用无数生动的事实，证明了这条真理。桥驿公社洞阳大队和望胜大队的事实，就是一个特别鲜明的对比：
    洞阳大队三百五十七户社员都住在江家山一带，一千二百七十五亩早稻田分布在一百八十六条小山沟里，90％是沙子田，漏水走肥，阳光条件也很差。当地群众叫做“半夜三更看明月，中午方能见太阳”的地方。今年大队党总支书记周寅初带领群众开展了改造低产田的斗争。正月间，山上白雪皑皑，总支书记和共产党员、共青团员们带头破雪运山后的绿苔下田改良土壤。全队出动一千二百多人，在高山上开凿五十四条溜槽，架起二十三条高空索道，出动七百多部土车，全队出现了“坡上滚、空中飞、平地推”的雄伟场面。干部群众苦战一个多月，全队一千多亩稻田加深了二、三寸土层，改良了土质。为了克服山区气温低的困难，他们在山上开了一千多条排冷浸水的小渠道；并且架起长梯，把田坎边的杂草杂树砍光。这样，不仅增加了稻田光照，而且山鼠兽害也减少了。在早稻育秧季节，他们结合烧火土灰，在秧田边到处烧起火堆，增加温度。今年全大队早稻插秧较去年提早八天。就这样节节奋战，全大队七百六十三亩早稻平均每亩收干谷五百六十斤，获得较去年增产两成半的大丰收。
    在大山脚下、平原地带的望胜大队，自然条件比洞阳大队好得多。今年这里一千九百四十三亩早稻，平均每亩只收干谷四百一十六斤半，较去年每亩减产十四斤。这是为什么？最近，桥驿公社党委会在这里召开了全社六百多人的干部会，发动望胜大队的社员们对比洞阳大队增产的情况进行总结，找出了早稻减产的原因。社员张贴了几百张大字报，除了自我检讨外，都对大队党总支提了意见。社员意见集中在：大队领导干部对生产和政治思想工作抓得不紧，太放任自流了。今年收集社员的家肥数量较去年减少了大约一半，稻田施肥较去年少，特别是精肥少。早稻中耕追肥的时候，有60％的稻田只用轮子拖一下，也没有追施什么肥料。这样，今年早稻就减产了。经过对比总结、整顿思想作风以后，干部和群众干劲重新高涨，干部深入田间领导群众抗旱抢插晚稻，扩种晚秋作物。全大队的抗旱劲头大，受到公社的通报表扬。
    长沙县对比总结的事实也说明：在向高额丰产进军的道路上，决不能松气自满。稍一松劲，就有掉队的危险。全县去年获得红旗的先进农业社（现在的生产队），今年早稻减产的有二十多个；去年比较落后的农业社（现在的生产队），有六十多个赶先进的劲头足，今年早稻增产都很突出。
    高桥公社荣华生产队自然条件较好，去年早稻亩产七百零九斤十三两。去年公社化后修了一座大水库，生产条件更好了。但是有些干部群众开始产生自满情绪，认为田底子肥，生产条件又好，别人出几身黑汗也赶不上。大家一松劲，出工的人减少了，基肥也比去年少，消灭三类苗的工作也没有及时跟上去。结果，全队早稻较去年减产三成。
    和他们相邻的百禄生产队，分布在十九条山沟里，五百六十亩田就有一千九百六十二丘，往年一直是个低产队。他们的志气高，改造自然的劲头大。山冲田经常受山洪流沙袭击。去冬冒着积雪，傍山开凿四十三条防洪防沙沟，造防洪林六百多亩。没有钱买商品肥料，就组织专业队坐山积肥。今年全队早稻增产四成多。
    靖港公社今年七万多亩早稻较去年减产一成。自然条件较好、连年增产的六个生产大队，今年早稻都减产了；而自然条件较差、过去生产比较落后的五个生产大队，今年早稻都增产了。公社党委会认为教训只有一条：任何时候都要鼓足干劲，兢兢业业地工作，不能有松懈自满的情绪。今春，生产基础较好的生产队，有些干部和群众背了“先进”包袱，产生了松气情绪。到早稻扬花抽穗的时候，公社党委才发现去年生产好的地方，今年早稻长得并不好。从这里，公社党委会深刻体会到必须改进领导方法。既要抓后进，又要抓先进；既要注意抓两头，又要注意带中间。这样才能做到后进赶先进，先进更先进。
