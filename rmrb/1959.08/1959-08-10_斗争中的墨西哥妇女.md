    Mexican Women in Struggle
    By Marianela Mondragon Nunez, Head of the Mexican Women's Delegation
    Women account for slightly more than half of Mexico's population. Only in recent years have they actively and positively participated in Mexico's economic, political, and social life, playing a very important role.
    Among the Mexican women participating in the country's economic life are clerks, professionally trained women, teachers, workers, and peasants. Female employees working in government agencies are protected by the so-called rights law. However, the majority of female employees employed by private enterprises do not enjoy any legal protection. Both groups of female employees earn meager salaries, making it difficult to cope with various burdens and often resorting to borrowing to make ends meet.
    Professionally trained women refer to those who have had the opportunity to study, and they have made many sacrifices to obtain these opportunities. Even if their talents are no less than those of men, they encounter many restrictions in obtaining a responsible position. Even if they do, their salary and treatment are lower.
    In our country, 80% of teachers are women. However, women rarely hold key leadership positions in schools and trade unions.
    Female workers are the most suffering women in the cities. In our country, the principle of "equal pay for equal work" has not yet been implemented. Trade unions are not always controlled by honest and genuine representatives of workers, and therefore cannot protect the rights and interests of workers, let alone protect the special rights and interests of women.
    An important part of the women participating in the country's economic life is the so-called "domestic workers." These women do not enjoy social insurance, have no holidays, do not enjoy any legal protection, do not receive medical care, and cannot even have a day off. They do not have fixed wages, but receive some very low remuneration according to the amount of work they do. Therefore, often the whole family, even including young children, participate in such work.
    Rural women are another class of women who suffer deeply. They do not have the right to land, credit, and water use. The abandonment of land reform halfway, the low price of agricultural products, the lack of credit, and the lack of water cause them to suffer along with their husbands. Their children do not receive basic sanitation and medical care.
    Despite all these discriminations, Mexican women today are increasingly aware of their important role in the struggle for their own political and economic independence and in the struggle with men for the independence and sovereignty of the country.
    Currently, women are making efforts to participate in all aspects of national life. They participated in the election of deputies for the first time in 1955, and in the election of the President of the Republic in 1958. Various political parties have seen the power of women and use various methods to win them over, some with small favors; the most reactionary attempt to use religious ideas to win them over. However, women are constantly being educated. They demand that governments at all levels implement a just program that can guarantee the interests of the broad masses of women.
    Women are now devoting themselves to the struggle to improve living conditions.
    In our country's recent strike movements, female workers, together with male workers, have truly played their due role. At no time have they retreated. On the contrary, they persisted in the struggle. Mothers, daughters, and wives also participated in the struggle, financially supporting these movements, serving as liaison officers, seeking support from friendly organizations, organizing support committees, and so on.
    Women's participation in the country's economic, political, and social life means that their struggle cannot but attract attention. They are aware of the role they should play in the current movement. They are committed to creating the necessary conditions for the final struggle to overthrow imperialism and strive for democracy. They know that they have a dual task: on the one hand, to struggle with men for the special interests of women, and on the other hand, to struggle with men for the interests of ordinary workers.
    Women also understand that they should do everything in their power to safeguard peace among all peoples. As mothers and wives, they are the least able to allow war to take away their loved ones.
    In order to study and find the best forms of struggle, Mexico is preparing a national rural women's conference. This conference will help improve the situation of this important part of women. A Latin American Women's Congress is also being prepared in Latin America, where we will jointly seek the most appropriate ways to oppose imperialism and defend national sovereignty.

    斗争中的墨西哥妇女
    墨西哥妇女代表团团长　玛里亚内拉·蒙德拉贡·努涅斯
    妇女在墨西哥人口中占了半数稍多一些。只是在近几年来她们才积极而肯定地参加到墨西哥的经济、政治和社会生活中去，并且起了一个十分重要的作用。
    参加到国家经济生活中的墨西哥妇女中间有职员、学有专长的职业妇女、教师、工人和农民。在政府机关中供职的女职工有所谓权益法的保护。而另一大部分受雇于私营企业的女职工则享受不到什么法律保护。这两部分女职工薪俸微薄，难以应付种种负担而总不免借债度日。
    学有专长的职业妇女是指那些有机会学习过的妇女，她们为了获得学习机会曾作了不少的牺牲。即使她们的才能并不逊于男子，但要得到一个负责的地位，会遇到很多的限制。就是得到了，她们的薪金待遇也要低一些。
    我们国家里80％的教师是由妇女担任的。但是在学校和工会里妇女很少担负主要的领导工作。
    女工是城市里受苦最深的妇女。在我们国家里，还没有实行“同工同酬”的原则。工会并非常常为正直和真正的劳动者的代表所掌握，因而不能保卫劳动者的权益，更谈不上保卫妇女的特殊权益。
    在参加国家经济生活的妇女中有一个很重要的部分，这就是人们所说的“家务劳动者”。这些妇女享不到社会保险，没有假期，享不到任何法律的保护，得不到医疗的照顾，甚而不能有一天的休息。她们没有固定的工资，而是按活计的多寡得到一些极低微的报酬。因而往往是全家人，甚而包括幼童，都参加这样的工作。
    农村妇女是另一个受苦很深的妇女阶层。她们没有获得土地、信贷和用水的权利。土改的半途而废，农产品价格的低贱，缺乏信贷，缺乏水使她们跟丈夫一起承受苦难。她们的子女得不到起码的卫生条件和医疗照顾。
    尽管受到这种种歧视，墨西哥的妇女今天愈来愈觉悟到，自己在争取自身的政治和经济独立以及跟男人们一起为国家的独立和主权的斗争中的重要作用。
    目前妇女们正在为参加国家生活的各个方面而作着努力。他们在1955年第一次参加了议员的选举，在1958年参加了共和国总统的选举，各个政党看到了妇女的力量，便用各种方法争取她们，有的是用一些小恩小惠；那些最反动的则企图用宗教思想去笼络她们。但是，妇女们在不断地受到教育。她们要求各级政府实施一个公正的纲领，能保障广大妇女群众的利益。
    妇女们目前正奋身投入改善生活条件的斗争。
    在我国最近几次罢工运动中，女工们跟男工们在一起切实地起了她们应起的作用。在任何时候她们都没有退缩过。相反的，她们坚持斗争。母亲们，女儿们，妻子们也参加到斗争中来，从经济上资助这些运动，担任联络员的工作，争取友好组织的声援，组织支持委员会等等。
    妇女参加到国家的经济、政治和社会生活中，她们的斗争也就不能不引人注意。她们意识到自己在当前的运动中应起的作用。她们致力于为打倒帝国主义和争取民主的最后斗争创造必要的条件。她们知道自己有双重的任务，一方面跟男人们一起为妇女的特殊利益斗争，一方面又要跟男人们一起为一般劳动者的利益斗争。
    妇女们也了解她们应该竭尽全力来维护各族人民之间的和平。她们作为母亲和妻子是最不能允许战争来夺走她的亲人的。
    为了研究和寻找最好的斗争形式，墨西哥正在筹备一个全国农村妇女大会。这个会议将有助于改善这很重要的一部分妇女的处境。在拉丁美洲也正在筹备一个拉丁美洲妇女大会，在会上我们将共同来寻求反对帝国主义和保卫民族主权的最适当的办法。　（1959年7月20日）
