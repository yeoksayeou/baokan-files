The Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs officially opened in Hiroshima on the 5th. The conference, held annually in Japan since 1955, has exerted great pressure on the imperialist bloc. Although the Japanese government has obstructed it every year, the momentum of the conference has grown stronger each time. The number of participating countries in the first and second conferences was fourteen, in the third it was twenty-five, and in the fourth it reached thirty-nine.

On January 16, 1955, the National Convention of the Japanese People Demanding the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons held in Tokyo passed a resolution requesting a global gathering in Hiroshima on August 6 of that year (the tenth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima) to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This resolution was supported by peace activists and peace organizations around the world, and the meeting was held on the scheduled date.

The first conference passed resolutions calling on a conference to be held with the participation of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, France, and India to ease international tensions, and opposing the transport of atomic weapons into Japan. The conference issued a declaration calling on the people of the world to further strengthen the struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

On August 6, 1956, the second conference opened in Tokyo, Japan, and moved to Nagasaki from August 9-11. The conference resolved to demand that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union conclude an agreement to ban atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, to demand that countries around the world hold a world conference to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and reduce armaments, and to oppose the rearmament of Japan. The conference adopted a declaration calling on the people of the world to further carry out the movement to prohibit the manufacture, testing, and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs and to achieve disarmament.

The powerful third conference passed three important documents, demanding that the countries concerned conclude an international agreement for the immediate and unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, to abolish all military blocs, to abolish all military bases on foreign territories, and to withdraw all troops from all foreign territories.

The fourth world conference was even larger in scale. In addition to passing resolutions on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the abolition of bases on foreign territories, the conference also called for the abolition of the colonial system, supported the people of all countries fighting for independence and unification, and demanded the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the Middle East, the Far East, and Europe.

The Chinese people have consistently supported the holding of each conference and its resolutions, and have sent delegations to participate in the first three conferences. In 1958, due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's adoption of a policy hostile to our country, our country was unable to send representatives to participate in the conference.

    禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会
    第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会正式会议已于5日在广岛开幕。从1955年以来每年在日本举行的大会曾给予了帝国主义集团以极大压力。虽然日本政府每年都横加阻挠，但是大会声势仍然一次比一次壮大。参加第一、二次大会的国家为十四国，第三次为二十五国，第四次已达三十九国。
    1955年1月16日在东京举行的日本人民要求禁止原子武器和氢武器全国大会上通过决议，要求在是年8月6日（广岛遭到原子弹轰炸的十周年纪念日）在广岛举行一个要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的世界性集会。这个决议得到了世界各国和平人士和和平组织的支持，在预定日期，举行了会议。
    第一届大会上通过了要求举行有苏、中、美、英、法、印参加的国际会议来缓和国际紧张局势，反对把原子武器运进日本等决议。大会发表宣言号召全世界人民进一步加强争取禁止原子弹和氢弹斗争。
    1956年8月6日，第二届大会在日本东京开幕，8月9日—11日移至长崎举行。大会决议要求美、英、苏三国缔结禁止原子弹、氢弹试验协定，要求世界各国举行禁止原子弹、氢弹和裁减军备世界大会，反对日本重新武装等。会议通过宣言，呼吁世界人民进一步开展运动，禁止制造、试验、使用原子弹和氢弹和实现裁减军备。
    声势浩大的第三届大会通过了三个重要文件，要求各有关国家缔结一项立即无条件禁止原子弹和氢弹试验的国际协定，取消一切军事集团、取消在外国领土上的一切军事基地和从所有外国领土上撤退一切军队。
    第四届世界大会规模更大。会议除继续就裁减军备、禁止原子武器和从外国领土上撤销基地等问题通过决议外，并要求废除殖民制度，支持为独立和统一而斗争的各国人民，要求在中东和远东、欧洲建立无原子武器地区。
    中国人民一直支持各届大会的举行和各项决议，并且先后派出代表团参加头三次大会。1958年，由于岸信介政府采取了敌视我国的政策，我国未能派出代表参加大会。
