Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Budapest: The Hungarian National Assembly held a meeting from July 29th to 30th. Hungarian Party and state leaders such as Kádár, Dobi, and Münnich attended the meeting.

During the meeting, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government's Minister of Finance, Antos István, presented a report to the Assembly on the implementation of the 1958 national budget.

Antos said that the 1958 revenue increased by 2.3 billion forints compared to the original plan, and expenditures increased by 2.6 billion, with a national surplus of 755.5 million forints at the end of the year. The state relied on its own strength to ensure a balance of payments and expanded reproduction, and improved the people's living standards.

Last year, the government increased basic construction investment by 1.6 billion forints and construction investment by 400 million forints beyond the original plan. A total of 13.1 billion forints of basic construction was put into production throughout the year.

Antos said that the implementation of the national budget plan in the first half of this year was also smooth. In the first half of the year, national industry increased by 9% compared to the same period last year, and the average output per worker increased by 3% compared to the same period last year. The broad masses of working people enthusiastically responded to the Party Central Committee's call in March this year to accelerate socialist construction, and universally launched socialist labor competitions, which powerfully promoted the development of the national economy.

After the great development of the spring agricultural cooperativization movement, the state guaranteed economic support for the newly established cooperatives, providing large amounts of loans, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery.

With the development of production, the people's living standards have also been improved. In the first half of this year, the wages of employees increased by 9% compared to the same period last year, the purchasing power of farmers increased by 6%, and the state increased the amount of pensions and family allowances. The supply of retail goods is very sufficient.

Kállai Gyula, member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of State, reported on the domestic political, economic, and cultural situation, as well as the international situation. Kállai said that Hungary has made great achievements in socialist construction over the past year or so, especially after the resolution of the Party Central Committee's March Plenary Session this year, industrial production has significantly increased. Over the past year or so, the collectivization movement and agricultural production have been developing smoothly.

Speaking of the international situation, Kállai sternly condemned the "Captive Nations Week" launched by the United States. He said that this is a provocation by US imperialism against the socialist camp. Finally, the meeting adopted the report on the implementation of the 1958 national budget. The meeting also passed the law on the promulgation of the Civil Code of the Hungarian People's Republic, and Minister of Justice Nézvál Ferenc reported to the meeting on this issue.

    国家财政收支有盈余　工农业生产蓬勃发展
    匈牙利社会主义建设进展迅速
    国民议会讨论去年和今年上半年预算执行情况
    本报综合报道　据新华社布达佩斯消息：匈牙利国民议会自7月29日到30日举行了会议。匈牙利党和国家的领导人卡达尔、道比和明尼赫等出席了会议。
    在会议期间，匈牙利工农革命政府财政部长安托什·伊斯特万向议会作了1958年度国家预算的执行情况的报告。
    安托什说，1958年度的收入比原计划增加了二十三亿福林，支出增加了二十六亿，年终结算时国家结余七亿五千五百万福林。国家依靠自己的力量保证了收支平衡和扩大再生产，并且提高了人民的生活水平。
    去年，政府在原计划之外又增加了十六亿福林的基本建设投资和四亿福林的修建投资。全年共有一百三十一亿福林的基本建设已投入生产。
    安托什说，今年上半年国家预算计划执行情况也很顺利。上半年国家工业比去年同时期增加了9％，每个工人的平均生产量比去年同时期提高了3％。广大劳动群众热烈响应今年3月党中央提出的关于加速社会主义建设的号召，普遍展开了社会主义劳动竞赛，有力地推动了国民经济的发展。
    在春季农业合作化运动大发展后，国家保证了对新成立的合作社的经济支持，提供了大批贷款、化肥和农业机器。
    随着生产的发展，人民的生活水平也得到了提高。今年上半年，职工的工资比去年同时期提高了9％，农民的购买力提高了6％，国家并提高了养老金和家庭补助金的数额。零售商品的供应非常充分。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、国务部长卡拉伊·久洛就国内政治、经济和文化方面的情况以及国际形势作了报告。卡拉伊说，一年多来匈牙利在社会主义建设中取得了很大的成绩，特别是在今年党中央3月全会的决议后，工业生产有了显著的提高。一年多来合作化运动和农业生产都在顺利地发展。
    在谈到国际形势时卡拉伊严正谴责了美国所发动的“被奴役国家周”。他说，这是美帝国主义对社会主义阵营的挑衅。最后，会议通过了关于1958年度国家预算执行情况的报告。会议还通过了关于颁布匈牙利人民共和国民法法典的法律，司法部长内兹瓦尔·费伦茨就这个问题向会议做了报告。
