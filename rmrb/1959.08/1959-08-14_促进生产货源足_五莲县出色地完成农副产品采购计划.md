　　Promote Production to Ensure Sufficient Supply
　　Wulian County Excellently Completes Procurement Plan for Agricultural and Sideline Products
    This newspaper reports from Jinan on August 13th: The commercial departments of Wulian County, Shandong Province, serve production in every way and consider the needs of the masses in everything they do. They have not only vigorously supported agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production, but also excellently completed various business plans. The Party Committee praised them as "good helpers in production," and the masses praised them as "good servants of the people."
    The vast majority of commercial workers in this county have a good sense of the masses and production. They often seize procurement from production and promote the contract system on the basis of helping the masses develop production. When promoting the production, procurement, and sales contract system this spring, commercial personnel brought contract papers and went deep into production teams to work while laboring. First, they helped the masses draft production plans, ensuring that production plans were implemented down to the small teams. Then, they directly signed 370 purchase contracts with the production teams for commodities such as hogs, tussah silk, sheep wool, cashmere, and fresh and dried fruits. They also issued over 117,000 yuan in advance deposits at any time according to the production requirements of the masses, supplying over tens of thousands of jin of more than ten kinds of raw materials and seeds. They also actively cultivated new sources of goods, increasing the variety of agricultural and sideline production in the county from 78 to 89. Sugar radishes, fresh goat milk, water chestnuts, lotus roots, and fruit baskets, which were not previously produced, are now produced in large quantities. When cultivating new sources of goods, commercial personnel brought samples and technology to the countryside, acting as both salespersons and technicians. In the past year, fruit packaging supplies relied on Qingdao, with a fruit basket costing 18 yuan, and the supply was not timely. As a result, some of the 300,000 jin of fresh fruit transferred out rotted. This year, the fruit harvest is unprecedentedly abundant, with a planned transfer of 1.4 million jin. The commercial department sent people to Qingdao to get samples and learn technology, and also sent people to the countryside with samples to teach the masses technology and sign over 20,000 fruit basket production contracts with them. This not only solved the packaging problem for 1.4 million jin of fresh fruit, but also provided support to other areas. Some production teams in mountainous areas had stockpiles of materials, while others needed these materials but could not buy them. The commercial department sent a large number of cadres to investigate and then carried out many small-scale material exchanges between the 392 production teams in the county, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies through the signing of bilateral and multilateral contracts. They found sales channels for kudzu vines (a fibrous plant that can be used to make ropes) from the Zhongzhi and Guanshuai communes, which previously had no sales channels. They transferred 140 large and small cattle from the Hubu and Songbai communes, which had many mountains and little land but bred many cattle, to the Wanghu commune and others. In previous years, fruits such as cherries and apricots in the mountainous areas could not be transported out and rotted a lot. This year, the commercial department purchased and processed them locally, turning the fruit into liqueur and food, which not only avoided losses but also enlivened the market.
    The commercial personnel in this county also take the needs of the masses into consideration in every way when purchasing local specialties. They purchase whatever the commune produces and whenever it is produced, ensuring that there is a sale whenever there is production, combining production and sales. This spring, when purchasing fresh eggs from remote mountainous areas, the purchasing personnel brought chicks and general merchandise to purchase door-to-door. The masses happily sold eggs and exchanged them for chicks and daily necessities. Purchasing and sales were achieved in one stroke, and the masses were very satisfied. When purchasing wild medicinal materials, the commercial personnel took samples, taught the masses how to identify medicinal herbs, and organized procurement. Therefore, the county overfulfilled the procurement plan for agricultural and sideline products in the first half of the year, and also overfulfilled the supply and sales plan for production and living materials.
    The commercial departments in this county have adopted many measures to facilitate the masses in their business activities, and have established close ties with the broad masses. Many township supply and marketing cooperative directors climb mountains and cross ridges to deliver goods and purchase them. In the procurement work, they adopted a method of having many points and a wide coverage, purchasing whatever the amount, whether large or small. Now, 14 purchase points and 370 sub-points have been established in the county, forming a network of procurement scattered like stars in the sky. Procurement personnel also often visit members to make contact. For example, the manager of the Folitang store supplies materials during the day and goes to the production team in the evening to help study production problems. If the production team lacks raw materials for processing small farm tools, he tries to supply them in a timely manner; if the store has difficulties, the production team also helps solve them.

### 促进生产货源足　五莲县出色地完成农副产品采购计划

　　促进生产货源足
　　五莲县出色地完成农副产品采购计划
    本报济南13日电　山东省五莲县商业部门处处为生产服务，事事为群众打算，既有力地支援了农林牧副渔各项生产，又出色地完成了各项业务计划。党委夸奖他们是“生产上的好帮手”，群众称赞他们是“人民的好勤务员”。
    这个县的绝大部分商业工作人员具有较好的群众观念和生产观念。他们经常从生产中抓采购，在帮助群众发展生产的基础上推行合同制。今年春季推行产购销合同时，商业人员带合同纸，深入生产队边劳动边工作，先帮群众打生产谱，使生产计划落实到小队，然后直接与生产小队签订了毛猪、柞蚕、绵羊毛、羊绒、干鲜果等收购合同三百七十份，并且随时根据群众的生产要求，发放了预付定金十一万七千多元，供应原料、种子等十余种数十万斤。他们还积极培植新货源，使全县农副业生产的品种由七十八种增加到八十九种。糖萝卜、鲜羊奶、菱角、荷藕、果筐等过去没有，现在都大量生产了。商业人员在培植新货源时，都是带样品、带技术下乡，既是营业员又是技术员。去年水果的包装用品靠青岛供应，一个果筐十八元，供应还不及时，外调鲜果三十万斤，结果烂了一些。今年水果空前丰收，计划外调一百四十万斤，商业部门派人到青岛拿样品学技术，又派人带着样品下乡，深入队、户向群众传授技术，同群众签订了两万多个果筐生产合同，不仅解决了一百四十万斤鲜果的包装问题，还可支援外地。山区有些生产队物资积压，另外有的队需要这些物资买不到，商业部门便派出大批干部摸底排队，然后在全县三百九十二个生产队之间开展了许多次小型物资交流，通过签订双边、多边合同调剂有无。他们为中至、管帅等公社的从无销路的葛子（一种纤维植物，可以拧绳）找到了销路；从山多地少繁殖耕牛多的户部、松柏公社调给汪湖等公社大、小牛一百四十头。往年山区的樱桃、杏子等水果运不出去，霉烂很多，今年商业部门就地收购，就地加工，把水果加工成露酒、食品，既避免了损失，又活跃了市场。
    这个县的商业人员在收购土特产时，也是处处为群众着想。公社生产什么就收购什么，何时生产出来就何时收购，作到有产就有销，产、销结合。今春从深山僻野的地方收购鲜蛋，收购人员带着雏鸡和百货登门收购，群众高兴地卖鸡蛋换回雏鸡和日用品，购、销一箭双雕，群众都很满意。在收购野生药材时，商业人员拿着样品，教群众识别药草，组织采购。因此，全县上半年农副产品采购计划超额完成，同时超额完成了生产、生活资料的供应销售计划。
    这个县的商业部门在业务活动中采取了许多便利群众的措施，和广大群众建立了亲密的联系。很多乡供销社主任爬山越岭推车送货和收购。收购工作中，采取了点多面广、多少皆收、大小齐收的办法。现在全县设立了十四个收购点，三百七十个分点，形成了一个星罗棋布的采购网。采购员还常登门和社员联系。例如，佛里堂门市部经理白天搞物资供应，晚上到生产队帮助研究生产问题，生产队加工小农具缺原料，他就设法及时供应；门市部有困难，生产队也帮助解决。
