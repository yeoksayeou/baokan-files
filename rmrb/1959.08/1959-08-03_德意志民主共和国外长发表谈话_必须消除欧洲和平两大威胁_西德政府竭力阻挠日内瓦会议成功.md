Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd, Telegram from TASS, Berlin, August 1st: According to a report from the German News Agency reporter in Geneva, German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz, who is attending the Geneva Conference, spoke to journalists from socialist countries. He said that the German Democratic Republic delegation is determined to promote the elimination of the two major dangerous sources threatening German peace and European peace: The first danger, arising from the revival of West German militarism, should be eliminated through the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany; the second danger, arising from the retention of the occupation regime in West Berlin, should be eliminated by making West Berlin a demilitarized free city.

Bolz emphasized that the German Democratic Republic delegation came to Geneva to promote the easing of tensions in Germany and Europe. However, from the first day of the conference, it has been evident that the policy of the current government of the Federal Republic of Germany is the main obstacle on the road to the success of the conference. The West German delegation's task in Geneva is to reject all proposals from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and to insist on unacceptable proposals from the West. The policy of the West German government is to intensify the atomic armament of West Germany and to try by all means to obstruct the success of the Geneva Conference.

Referring to the visit of West Berlin Mayor Brandt to Geneva, Bolz pointed out that Brandt's trip was motivated by fear of reaching mutual understanding, fear that measures would be taken to abolish the West Berlin occupation regime, and fear that differences would be reduced.

Bolz then said that the German Democratic Republic had proposed to the Federal Republic of Germany the conclusion of a treaty of non-aggression between the two German states, which would stipulate that the two German states must not threaten or use force against each other. Bonn rejected this proposal. This shows that the Bonn government is not only opposed to German peace, but also to world peace.

Bolz finally emphasized that it is possible to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference. The proposals jointly put forward by the Soviet delegation and the German Democratic Republic delegation have taken into account the views of other parties as much as possible.

    德意志民主共和国外长发表谈话
    必须消除欧洲和平两大威胁
    西德政府竭力阻挠日内瓦会议成功
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社柏林1日讯：据德意志通讯社记者自日内瓦报道，出席日内瓦会议的德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨向社会主义国家记者发表了谈话。他说，德意志民主共和国代表团决心促进消除威胁着德国和平和欧洲和平的两个大的危险策源地：由于西德军国主义的复活而产生的第一个危险，应该通过缔结对德和约来消除；由于在西柏林保留占领制度而产生的第二个危险，应该通过使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的途径来消除。
    博尔茨强调指出，德意志民主共和国代表团到日内瓦来是为了促使德国和欧洲的紧张局势得到缓和。但是，从会议的第一天起就可以看到，德意志联邦共和国现政府的政策是会议成功道路上的主要障碍。西德代表团在日内瓦的任务是拒绝苏联和德意志民主共和国的一切建议，并坚持西方提出的不能接受的建议。西德政府的政策是加紧原子武装西德，企图用一切方法阻挠日内瓦会议得到成功。
    博尔茨在谈到西柏林市长勃兰特访问日内瓦一事时指出，勃兰特此行是由于害怕取得相互谅解，害怕会采取措施取消西柏林占领制度，害怕分歧有所减少。
    博尔茨接着说，德意志民主共和国向德意志联邦共和国提出了关于缔结两个德国互不侵犯条约的建议，这个条约将规定两个德国不得相互威胁和采用武力。波恩拒绝了这个建议。由此可见，波恩政府不仅反对德国和平，而且反对世界和平。
    博尔茨最后强调指出，在日内瓦会议上，我们有可能达成协议。苏联代表团和德意志民主共和国代表团共同提出的建议已经尽可能地照顾到其他方面的观点。
