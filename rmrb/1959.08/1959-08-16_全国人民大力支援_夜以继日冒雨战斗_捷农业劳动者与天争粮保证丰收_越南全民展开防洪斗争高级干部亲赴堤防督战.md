Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 14th: Our correspondent reports: Czechoslovak agricultural workers, with the strong support of the people of the whole country, are now enthusiastically launching a battle to seize grain from the heavens. People are braving the continuous rain, working day and night to harvest summer crops to ensure this year's bumper harvest.

Currently, more than 93% of the country's grain crops have been harvested, and more than 87% of the feed crops have been harvested. It is estimated that all harvesting work will be completed within three to five days.

This year is a bumper year for Czechoslovakia. However, shortly after the wheat harvest began, the continuous rainy weather seriously threatened the harvest. Under the call of the Communist Party and the government, the working people all over the country mobilized to rush the harvest. Almost every day, tens of thousands of soldiers, workers, and students went to the countryside to help with the summer harvest, and factories and troops also sent a large number of transportation vehicles to support the countryside, so that the harvested grains could be transported from the fields in time. On one Sunday alone, the number of people from the Prague region who came out to help with the summer harvest reached more than 26,000, and the number of transport vehicles reached more than 900. This region has an average of more than 3,500 soldiers and more than 350 trucks helping agricultural production cooperatives harvest and transport wheat every day. Some factories have also organized "rescue teams" and "mobile teams" to help farmers thresh wheat at night. Members of agricultural production cooperatives are even more inseparable from the fields day and night. They harvest during the day and thresh wheat at night. Therefore, in these days, no matter whether it is raining heavily or drizzling, whether it is night or day, there are crowds of people working hard in the fields, machines rumbling, and transport vehicles flowing continuously, everywhere is filled with a fighting atmosphere.

The hard work has brought people the joy of a bumper harvest. This year's good harvest is something that Czechoslovakia has not seen for many years. It was originally estimated that the average yield of wheat per hectare in the country will increase by 400 kilograms compared with last year, and barley will increase by 230 kilograms. However, according to the person in charge of the relevant units of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year's actual harvest greatly exceeds this expected target. The unit area yield of agricultural production cooperatives in many regions has even exceeded more than double the average yield of last year. For example, the unit area yield of eight hectares of winter barley in the Knezeves Agricultural Production Cooperative averaged 5400 kilograms.

The grain purchasing work is being carried out almost simultaneously with the summer harvest work. The farmers have put forward the slogan of "selling the best grain that is threshed first to the state." At present, seven regions have completed the state's grain purchasing task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.

While some areas are still carrying out the summer harvest in full swing, some areas that have finished the summer harvest have begun the summer cultivation work in full swing. Tractors have begun to carry out initial tillage or deep plowing on the harvested land, and winter crop sowing is about to begin.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 14th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency on the 13th, in the past few days, many ministers, vice ministers and other senior cadres of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have gone to the provinces along the river to urge preparations for the struggle against floods and storms.

They are Ton Quang Phiet, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, Tran Dang Khoa, Minister of Water Resources, Nguyen Van Tao, Minister of Labor, Nghiem Xuan Yem, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and Phan Anh, Minister of Foreign Trade.

At present, although the water level of all rivers in Vietnam is much higher than in previous years, no section of the dike has broken. This is because the dike reinforcement plan for this year was completed in a timely manner with three times the amount of earthwork excavated last year; at the same time, all sections of the people actively participated in the work of protecting the dikes.

Currently, in those flooded fields, the local people are continuing to drain the water with the strong help of the People's Army and cadres. In just a few days, they saved the vast majority of crops on 40,000 hectares of land.

In the flood and storm resistance committees in the riverine areas, further preparations are being made to cope with the situation. These committees check the work of protecting the dikes every day. Members of the local Vietnamese Labor Party committees also work day and night on the dikes with the people to protect the dikes.

In a recent telegram to the administrative committees of various regions, Vice Premier Pham Hung suggested that all localities combine flood prevention preparation work with production work, and at the same time encourage farmers to do a good job in the agricultural cooperativization movement.

    新华社布拉格14日电　本社记者报道：捷克斯洛伐克农业劳动者在全国人民支援下，目前正热火朝天地展开一场与天争粮的战斗。人们冒着绵绵阴雨，夜以继日地紧张抢收夏收作物以保证今年的丰收。
    目前，全国粮食作物的收割工作已经完成了93％以上，饲料作物的收割工作完成了87％以上。预计，全部收割工作将在三、五天内结束。
    今年是捷克斯洛伐克的一个丰收年。但是，在麦收开始后不久，阴雨连绵的坏天气就严重地威胁着丰收。在共产党和政府的号召下，全国各地的劳动人民都动员起来进行抢收。差不多每天都有成千上万的战士、工人、学生到农村去帮助夏收，工厂、部队还派出了大批的运输工具支援农村，使收割的谷物能及时从田间运走。仅仅在一个星期天，布拉格州出动帮助夏收的人数就达二万六千多人，运输汽车达到九百多辆。这个州平均每天都有三千五百名以上的战士、三百五十多辆载重汽车帮助农业生产合作社收麦、运麦。有的工厂还组织了“抢救队”、“流动队”在夜间帮助农民打麦。农业生产合作社社员更是昼夜不离田间，他们白天收割，夜晚打麦。因此，在这些日子里，不论大雨倾盆或细雨纷飞，不论夜晚或白天，田野里都有紧张劳动的人群、轰隆转动的机器、川流不息的运输工具，到处洋溢着一片战斗的气氛。
    紧张的劳动为人们带来了丰收的喜悦。今年的大好年景是捷克斯洛伐克多年来所没有的。原来预计，今年全国小麦每公顷的平均产量将比去年增产四公担，大麦将增产二点三公担。然而，据捷克斯洛伐克农林部有关单位负责人谈，今年的实际收成大大超过这一预计的指标。不少州的农业生产合作社的单位面积产量甚至超过了去年平均产量的一倍以上。如克内泽维兹农业生产合作社八公顷冬大麦的单位面积产量平均达到五十四公担。
    粮食收购工作几乎是与夏收工作同时进行的。农民们提出了“把最先打出的最好的粮食卖给国家”的口号。目前，已经有七个州提前超额完成了国家的粮食收购任务。
    当一些地区还在紧张进行夏收的时候，一些结束了夏收的地区又开始了紧张的夏耕工作。拖拉机在收获后的土地上开始进行初耕或深耕，冬季作物播种也就要开始了。
    新华社河内14日电　据越南通讯社13日报道，最近几天内，越南民主共和国的许多部长、副部长和其他高级干部都到沿河各省去督促同洪水和暴风雨作斗争的准备工作。
    他们是越南国会常务委员会副委员长孙光阀、水利部长陈登科、劳动部长阮文造、农林部长严春庵和对外贸易部长潘英等人。
    目前，越南所有河流的水位虽然比过去历年都要高得多，但是没有任何一段堤防决口。这是由于用三倍于去年挖掘的土方，及时地完成了今年的堤防加固计划；同时，所有各段的人民都积极地参加了保卫堤防的工作。
    目前，在那些被水淹没的田地上，当地人民正在人民军和干部的大力帮助下继续排除积水。仅仅在几天之内，他们就在四万公顷田地上挽救了绝大部分农作物。
    在沿河地区的各个抗击洪水和风暴委员会，都在作进一步的准备以应付局势。这些委员会每天都检查保护堤防的工作。当地越南劳动党委员会的委员们也日夜在堤防上和人民一起进行护堤工作。
    范雄副总理最近在致各地区行政委员会的电报中，建议各地把防洪准备工作和生产工作结合起来，同时要鼓励农民搞好农业合作化运动。
