Friendship Farm During the Wheat Harvest
By Our Correspondent Tan Li
　　Passing through Xinglong Town in Jixian County, you enter the area of the state-owned Sino-Soviet Friendship Farm. Before your eyes unfolds a vast expanse of land, where boundless wheat shimmers golden in the sunlight, and lush soybeans resemble a thousand acres of blue waves. For four years, the pioneers of the Friendship Farm, under the leadership of the Party and inspired by Sino-Soviet friendship, have been wholeheartedly building this beautiful agricultural base. The working people have transformed nature and tempered themselves in the process.

    Combine Harvesters in Action
    Towards the end of July, the spring wheat gradually ripened. The people of the Friendship Farm, as if welcoming a grand festival, were busily preparing for the harvest with joyful hearts.

    Trial harvesting began in a field of barley. The combine harvester roared, and the cutting blade, more than two meters wide, resembled a large planer, neatly trimming the wheat field. The cut wheat ears quickly passed through the threshing process on the combine harvester, and the wheat grains flowed out of the outlet like a spring. Everyone smiled, smelling the fresh aroma of the new wheat. The most cheerful smile belonged to Hao Huanwen, an outstanding tractor driver.

    Hao Huanwen is the driver of the “DT-54” type No. 82 tractor. During the wheat harvest, they aim to harvest 45 hectares of wheat per shift (15 mu per hectare), exceeding the quota by 125%. If you ask him if he can fully achieve this target, he confidently believes he can, based on the trial harvesting speed. What makes people believe this is not only his firm attitude, but also the tractor team's performance over the past four years since production began in March 1955. In the first half of this year, they have already overfulfilled the workload of 21,240 standard mu. More importantly, this tractor has not yet undergone a major overhaul. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Land Reclamation, a major overhaul is not required until 70,000 standard mu of work are completed by 1960. However, Hao Huanwen's team's tractor had already completed 77,655 standard mu of work without a major overhaul by November 3rd last year. So when will a major overhaul be needed? This young tractor driver said that when preparing for the wheat harvest, the tractor was inspected by engineers, who determined that it would not need a major overhaul this year. When asked how they managed to use it so well, this cheerful young man became a little embarrassed and hesitated before saying:
    "It's nothing, we just follow the farm's regulations, isn't it?" Following the farm's regulations and doing it conscientiously is not a simple matter. For four years, this team has been carrying out vehicle maintenance on time, especially keeping the parts clean. For this purpose, they carefully did a good job every day, regardless of the freezing winter or the scorching summer. This includes the precipitation and filtration of oil, frequent cleaning of the air filter, changing the engine oil on time, and ensuring the use of softened water (boiled water). They also pay attention to operation and never overload the tractor. These things may not sound particularly innovative, but doing them consistently without fail is not an ordinary thing. It cannot be done without a high sense of responsibility and a practical and hardworking attitude. Hao Huanwen is precisely a Communist Youth League member with this kind of quality.

    Producing 140,000 Jin of Grain Per Person
    Upon arriving at Friendship Farm, one hears that "the forty agricultural workers of the Second Team of the Fifth Branch Farm will produce 70 tons of grain for the state this year." Seventy tons is 140,000 jin!

    The Party Branch Secretary of the Second Team, Comrade Wang Guoxiang, is a demobilized company commander and a shrewd and capable young man. He is as familiar with his production team as he was with his company back then. He said that his team has planted 1,280 hectares of land this year. Apart from the logistics personnel, only forty people work in the fields, and thirty of them are machine operators. The agricultural machinery consists of six tractors and nine combine harvesters, four of which are automatic. To complete such a production plan, in addition to maximizing the power of the machines, it is important to implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. Their land has been deeply plowed to a depth of 35 to 45 centimeters, and they have also carried out seed selection and appropriate close planting. For fertilization, 140 jin of phosphate rock powder per mu was applied as base fertilizer for soybeans, as well as 40 jin of granular fertilizer. Ammonium nitrate will also be applied during inter-tillage and weeding. In addition, attention must be paid to field management. Pre-sowing weeding and harrowing after seedling emergence were trialed this year and appear to be very effective. They also plan to carry out inter-tillage three times. To prevent drought and waterlogging, they have drilled four wells and completed a drainage project of 20,000 cubic meters of earthwork.

    After listening to Wang Guoxiang's systematic introduction, everyone calculated the labor efficiency. To complete the plan of producing 70 tons of grain per person, assuming 250 workdays per year, each workday involves producing 560 jin of grain.

    After estimating the yield, Wang Guoxiang said: "To ensure that each person steadily obtains these 70 tons of grain, we have reclaimed an additional 100 hectares of wasteland outside the plan and planted soybeans, which are growing very well. This is the 'margin' they have left to ensure the completion of the plan."

　　友谊农场在麦收时节
　　本报记者　谭立
    走过集贤县的兴隆镇，就是国营中苏友谊农场的地区了。在你眼前展开的辽阔的土地上，一望无边的小麦在阳光下，金光闪闪，繁茂的大豆好似千顷碧波。四年来，友谊农场的拓荒者，在党的领导下，在中苏友谊的鼓舞下，全力建设起这个美好的农业基地。劳动人民改造了自然，同时也锻炼了自己。
    联合收割机开动了
    在7月底，春小麦渐渐成熟。友谊农场的人们像迎接一个盛大的节日似的，怀着喜悦的心情紧张地准备收割。
    试割工作在一块大麦地里开始了，联合收割机发出隆隆的声音，两米多宽的割剪机像个大推子，整整齐齐地在给麦田推平头。剪下的麦穗在联合收割机上飞快地经过了碾筛的工序，麦粒就如泉水一般从出口流出来。闻到新麦散发出的清香气味，大家都笑了。笑得最开朗的，是优秀的拖拉机手郝焕文。
    郝焕文，是“德特54”型82号机车的车长。他们在麦收里，要争取达到每班机收割四十五公顷小麦（每公顷合十五亩），超过定额125％。你要问他能不能完全达到这个指标，他根据试割的速度推算，一点不含糊地认为可以做到。使人相信这一点的，不只是他的坚决的态度，重要的是这个拖拉机小组自1955年3月开始生产，四年来的成绩为这一点作了保证。今年上半年，他们已超额完成二万一千二百四十标准亩的工作量。更重要的是这台机车至今也没大修过。照农垦部的规定：要求到1960年完成七万标准亩的工作量不大修。可是郝焕文小组这台拖拉机，早在去年11月3日就完成七万七千六百五十五标准亩工作量无大修。那末什么时候才需要大修？这位青年拖拉机手说，在准备麦收的时候，这台拖拉机经过工程师鉴定，认为今年还不需要大修。问他们怎么会使用得这样好呢？这个爽朗的小伙子却怪不好意思起来，迟疑了一下，才说：
  “没什么，还不是照场里规定的办吗？”照场里规定去做，认真去做，就不是件简单的事。他们这个小组四年如一日地按时进行车辆保养，特别是保持机件的清洁。为了这个，他们不管是滴水成冰的寒冬，还是赤日炎炎的夏季，每天都小心翼翼地作好。如油料的沉淀和过滤，空气滤清器的经常清理，按时换机油，保证上软水（煮沸过的水），再就是注意操作，绝不使机车负荷过重。这一些听起来没有什么特别的创造，可是要件件不差长期做下去，却不是件平常的事，没有高度的负责精神和实干苦干的劳动态度，是办不到的。郝焕文就正是具有这种品质的一个共青团员。
    每人生产十四万斤粮
    到了友谊农场就听到说：“五分场二队的四十名农业工人，今年每人要为国家生产七十吨粮食。”七十吨，就是十四万斤！
    二队的党支书王国祥同志，是一位转业的连长，是一位精明能干的青年。他熟悉他的生产队就像他当年的连队一样。他说他们队今年种了一千二百八十公顷地，除了后勤人员，只有四十个人下地，这里面倒有三十个是机械手。农业机器，是六台拖拉机、九台联合收割机，有四台是自动的。要完成这样的生产计划，除了发挥机器的力量，重要的是贯彻执行农业八字宪法。他们的地都深耕到三十五公分至四十五公分，也进行了选种和适当密植。施肥，是大豆每亩下了磷矿粉一百四十斤作基肥，还有四十斤颗粒肥。中耕锄草时还要追些硝酸铵。另外还要注意田间管理，今年试行了播前锄草、苗齐耙地，现在看起来很有效。他们还准备中耕三次。为了防旱防涝，他们打了四眼井，又作了两万土方的排水工程。
    听了王国祥这样有条有理的介绍，大家就计算起劳动效率来。如完成每人生产七十吨粮的计划，一年按二百五十个工日算，每一个工日是生产五百六十斤粮。
    王国祥估算了产量以后说：“为了每人稳拿这七十吨粮食，我们在计划之外又开垦了一百公顷荒地，也种上了大豆，长得还很好。这是他们为保证完成计划留有的“余地”。（附图片）
