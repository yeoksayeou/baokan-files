Heroes Who Opened Up the "Mountain Canal"
By our reporter Gu Lei

From Shimen Gorge to Jiudian Gorge, there are eighteen peaks in a row, each peak higher and more dangerous than the last. Devil's Gate, Wild Tiger Cliff, Parrot's Beak, Jade Emperor Peak, Tiger's Mouth... just hearing the names is frightening, let alone seeing them up close! This is the deep mountain and dense forest area of ancient Hezhou. The Jingyuan people, who are used to the turbulent waves of the Yellow River, are here to experience the storms on the high mountains.

This construction site is forty-two kilometers long, with only four or five villages and a hundred households, a remote and desolate place since ancient times. Here, there are: strange peaks and deep valleys, sheer cliffs, unpredictable wind and rain, thickets and wild animals, and hawks that cross the mountains and valleys. Those who study birds of prey know that the hawks of Hezhou are born with sharp eyes, fierce personalities, and enduring fighting abilities. This kind of hawk comes from the mountains on both sides of Jiudian Gorge. People who walk through the gorge alone feel a chill down their spines! In the past, this was a road from Lanzhou, through Min County, to Sichuan, a dangerous road. The Tao River flows out of the gorge, rushing towards Black Dian Gorge, the water roaring like a pack of tigers. The local people describe Jiudian Gorge as: God urinating, Yama firing cannons, cliff sheep passing by!

The "Mountain Canal" is designed on the cliffs, with the bottom of the canal at an altitude of 2,233 meters, 180 meters above the Tao River. The most arduous project is Jiudian Gorge, where the canal is 6.2 kilometers long, with two large inclined split sections in the middle, requiring 220 meters to be split off Jade Emperor Peak and 120 meters off Parrot's Beak. In June of last year, the Jingyuan people came here, and when they surveyed the terrain, when they lit bonfires to spend the night, when they sheltered from the wind and rain with oilcloth, they knew that this was going to be an unusual battle.

Climb up the cliff! This was the first test of the determination of the people who conquered Jiudian Gorge.

Standing at Yanziping at the entrance of Jiudian Gorge, looking at Parrot's Beak, you can't imagine that people can climb the cliff. Parrot's Beak is a large mountain protrusion extending from the middle of Jiudian Mountain, bulging upwards and reaching into the sky above the Tao River, with the end of the mountain bending downwards like a parrot's beak. Right under this beak, the cliff rises straight into the Tao River, more than 450 meters high. People have to climb to the cliff 350 meters above the Tao River, and carve out a small path, so that more people can stand on it to drill holes and set off explosives, splitting off a part of the mountain and then opening up the canal. Climbing the cliff was unfamiliar to everyone from Jingyuan, who were familiar with the Yellow River water and the boundless loess.

The first to climb the cliff of Parrot's Beak were Communist Party member Kang Yinghui and Communist Youth League member Li Zhen. Two lively young men, not even twenty-three years old! The two of them, tied with a rope more than a hundred meters long, slid down the cliff from above. They clung to the cliff like geckos, grabbing the protruding rocks on the cliff with both hands... Sometimes, they clung to the cliff and stood there, sometimes, their hands and feet lost their grip, and their bodies were suspended in the air by the rope, spinning around. Every inch they descended required all their strength, every inch they descended was fraught with the danger of death, and every inch they descended brought them closer to victory! When they reached the canal line, there was no way to drill holes. Their feet couldn't get a firm grip, and people became weak. When they put the drill in place, every time they struck a hammer, they were thrown away from the cliff, and they swayed violently. In desperation, they climbed back up the mountain. What to do? After everyone's discussion, they accepted Zhang Shengfu's suggestion: use two ropes to lower a wooden stick, suspend it horizontally on the cliff, and have people stand on the stick to work. This was the only way to go. Kang Yinghui and Li Zhen were lowered down the cliff a second time, tied the wooden stick, stood on the wooden stick, and began to drill holes. What a difficult task! The stick swung back and forth in the air, and the people standing on it had to maintain their balance at all times. If they weren't careful, their bodies would tilt forward and their heads would hit the rocks, or their bodies would tilt backward and they would fall into the air. If they struck the chisel lightly, it wouldn't penetrate the rock. If they used all their strength, every time they struck a hammer, their bodies would sway many times before they could strike the second hammer. From one side of the cliff to the other, there was a twelve-meter-wide precipice. How could people cross this section of the cliff horizontally! Kang Yinghui and Li Zhen tied a rope horizontally in the middle of the cliff, and people grabbed the rope with their hands, their feet in the air, their bodies suspended on the rope, and moved from one side to the other, alternating their hands. Once, Li Zhen was crossing the rope, and just as he moved to the middle, one of his hands slipped, his body spun around in the air, and he almost fell into the Tao River. Everyone who saw it broke out in a cold sweat. What did Li Zhen say?
“I wasn't afraid!”

In this dangerous environment, people calmly climbed up and down, swung their hammers millions of times, broke out in countless frightened sweats, their bodies were numbed by being suspended many times, and they overcame the danger of falling into the ravine time and time again. It took half a month to cut a path less than a foot wide in the waist of the cliff. Then more people were suspended by ropes, standing on this small path, and began the intense work of drilling holes.

Drilling holes is not a complicated task, it's just one person holding the drill and one person striking the hammer. However, it was particularly difficult in this place less than a foot wide! People had to sit there, facing the rolling river below their feet, facing the dizzying abyss, to do this work. Drilling holes here, there was nothing more dangerous than dropping the hammer! If a hammer missed, it would either smash the hand of the person holding the drill, or knock the drill down the cliff, or throw the hammerer off the cliff! Every hammer had to be careful. Sitting was not easy, it would bring fatigue too early. Li Zhen couldn't stand it, so he simply stood up, his back tightly against the stone wall, facing the air, swinging the hammer back and forth, every hammer hitting its mark, earning him the nickname "Stone Wall Tiger." When the drilled holes became larger, people could sit in the holes and continue digging inside. However, according to Li Zhen, "It's even harder, you can't raise your head, you can't lift the hammer, you can't straighten your legs, you have to suffer!" They still did it! The whole team worked in three shifts, day and night, taking turns going down the holes. The sound of the iron hammer echoed in the valley, drowning out the sound of the Tao River. At this time, people didn't know hardship, didn't know difficulty, they only thought about achieving victory after victory! A group of young people spared no effort to level Parrot's Beak. Li Zhen, at a young age, sat in the hole and swung an eight-pound hammer, hitting 560 times non-stop, which became a popular story on the construction site.

The heroes who climbed Parrot's Beak paved the way to all the cliffs with their courageous actions. Behind them, people climbed Jade Emperor Peak, Wild Fox Beak, Mazong Mountain, and Yellow Wind Ridge. The sound of iron hammers rose above Jiudian Gorge, red flags were planted on the cliffs, and blasting began! Jiudian Mountain was shaken, smoke filled the valley, and the Tao River endured the impact of tens of thousands of tons of stones every day. Wolves, leopards, and hawks, the rulers of the deep mountain and dense forest, all fled far away!

This was not the end of the difficulty, but the beginning of the difficulty. Now there was a need for explosives, detonators, loading, and blasting techniques. At first, the Jiudian Gorge section only had eighteen blasters who could set off small blasts, once every half day, which couldn't blast off four or five cubic meters of stone. One moment there were no drills, the next moment there wasn't enough explosive, the next moment the detonators ran out. Difficulties came one after another, as if deliberately testing the will of the Jingyuan people. The 1,500 young people who fought the battle of Jiudian Gorge launched a movement for everyone to learn blasting techniques. When there were few drills, they thought of improving the drill bit and increasing the efficiency of drilling. Just for the drill bit, they created two-edged, three-edged, crescent-shaped, buckwheat-shaped, pyramid-shaped... all kinds of shapes, and each improvement was equivalent to extending the life of the drill. At first, they drilled dry holes, then they changed to wet holes, using water, warm water, alkaline water, salt water, and urine, and each experiment brought new speed to the drillers. Setting off small blasts, large blasts, crack blasts, gourd blasts, and plum blossom row blasts, from small to large, from single to groups, each blast brought new records to the people. Loading yellow powder, black powder, mixing salt, mixing horse manure, mixing calcite..., looking for all kinds of ways to save explosives and increase the power of the explosion, and each method could strip more stones from the mountains! Human wisdom is endless, human will is immeasurable, and human creation is infinitely bold! Jiudian Mountain had met an invincible opponent!

Twenty-one-year-old He Chunbao and twenty-six-year-old Guan Zhencai have always been at the forefront of countless creators, making Jiudian Mountain tremble! He Chunbao was once depressed because he kept setting off small blasts. "Blasting only a little bit, how can that work, how many years will it take!" At that time, he and Guan Zhencai were almost professional loaders and blasters. Loading explosives everywhere, lighting fuses everywhere, and in the most tense moments, they stayed on the mountain for forty days without coming down, lighting fires everywhere. One day, He Chunbao climbed a cliff to light a fuse and saw a large crack in the middle of the stone. An idea flashed into his mind: what if he stuffed explosives into the crack! He came back and discussed it with Guan Zhencai. Guan Zhencai was never afraid of making things big when it came to blasting rocks, and immediately agreed: "Okay, let's try it." The two of them chose a stone crack, He Chunbao tied a rope around his waist and went down into the crack to load the explosives, and Guan Zhencai held the rope for safety. After loading the explosives, they couldn't light the fuse. The two of them went up and down, checking several times, but couldn't find the problem. It was getting dark, and the two of them ran down the mountain, carried the telephone up, and cranked it, but it still didn't ring. They didn't sleep well that night, and as soon as it dawned, they took a box of batteries up the mountain again, and finally detonated the blast. They loaded a total of ten pounds of explosives and blasted down 2,400 cubic meters of stone. Crack blasting spread throughout the Jiudian Mountain construction site, and people went to find stone cracks while drilling holes.

These two people never let go of any opportunity to improve the power of blasting, and they were always trying to create. At that time, detonators were very scarce. When He Chunbao was going up the mountain with a flashlight, suddenly a force made him stare blankly at the light bulb. He thought: could he use the light bulb as a detonator? There was no precedent for this, but if He Chunbao thought of it, he could do it. He took off the light bulb, ground a small hole in the glass in front, sprinkled a pinch of black powder on the tungsten wire, then sprinkled a little yellow powder, and applied current, using the burning of the tungsten wire to detonate the blast. The experiment was successful. These two people have been moving forward in creation. When I met them, they were already able to load large blasts of 3.5 tons of explosives. Guan Zhencai said with a smile: "As long as there are explosives, one blast can blow up Jiudian Mountain!"

The names of the several combat teams in the battle of Jiudian Gorge were Dongfeng (East Wind), Huohua (Spark), Gangtie (Steel), Xinghuo (Starlight), and Hongqi (Red Flag). They worked at Parrot's Beak, Jade Emperor Peak, Wild Fox Beak, Wolf's Mouth, Mazong Mountain, and Yellow Wind Ridge. The team names and mountain names were well-matched. They were all heroes, and each one had a legendary battle story. Communist Youth League member Li Jingshun once set a new record of hitting 1,050 hammers in one breath without dropping a single one. Each hammer weighing eight pounds had to be raised very high, and each strike had to use all the strength of the body, which required great determination and perseverance! Communist Youth League member Meng Qinglin, when measuring the corrected canal line of Jiudian Gorge, took six people, carried instruments on their backs, and climbed all over the cliffs and precipices, completing the task in nine days. On the last day, while working on a cliff, the notebook containing all the measured numbers fell off the cliff. The notebook contained the entire work results of the six people. Without hesitation, he was suspended by a rope and fell off the cliff to find the notebook. Coincidentally, the notebook was stuck on a small tree extending from the cliff. At this time, a breeze, even the slightest movement of the tree branch, could cause the notebook to fall into the Tao River. Meng Qinglin gently slid down the cliff, and gently climbed up the small tree, and took the notebook back. This required great adventurous spirit, a calm mood, light movements, and a strong will!

In the past, when the Tao River flowed through Jiudian Gorge, the water flow of more than ten meters wide beat against the cliffs, roaring fiercely. Now, the stones blasted off by the heroes are pouring into the Tao River day and night, the water flow is getting smaller and smaller, and the sound is getting weaker and weaker, leaving only a light breath. In Jiudian Gorge, you can no longer hear the roar of the flowing water, you can only hear the sound of cannons and songs, and Jiudian Mountain obediently lowered its head. (Attached picture)

　　开辟“山上运河”的英雄们
　　本报记者　顾雷
    石门峡到九甸峡，一连十八峰，一峰比一峰高，一峰比一峰险，鬼门关、野虎崖、鹦哥嘴、玉皇峰、老虎嘴……听着都吓人，不要说到跟前看啦！这是古老河州的深山密林地带。靖远人，在这里摆下战场，看惯了黄河惊涛骇浪的人，要经历经历高山上的暴风雨了。
    这个工地长四十二公里，只有四五个村庄，一百户大小人家，自古是一片偏僻荒凉的地方。这里，有的是：奇峰险壑、断崖深谷、无常的风雨、树丛和猛兽、穿山越峡的鹞鹰。对飞禽有研究的人，都知道河州的鹞鹰生就一双犀利的眼睛、凶猛的性格、持久的撕杀能力。这种鹰就出在九甸峡两边的大山上。人们只身走过这里的峡谷时，会感到毛骨悚然！过去，这是一条由兰州过岷县去四川的道路，一条危险的道路。洮河水从峡里出走，奔黑甸峡，水咆哮着，像群虎怒吼。当地群众对九甸峡的形容是：神仙尿尿，阎王放炮，崖羊过道！
    “山上运河”的河道设计在山崖上，渠底拔海高度二千二百三十三米，离洮河水面一百八十米。最艰险的工程是九甸峡，河道长六点二公里，中间有两段大斜劈工程，要劈下玉皇峰二百二十米，劈下鹦哥嘴一百二十米。去年6月，靖远人来到这里，当他们察看地形的时候，当他们烧起篝火度过夜晚的时候，当他们顶着油布遮蔽风雨的时候，就知道这是一场不平常的战斗了。
    爬到悬崖上去！这是对征服九甸峡人们的决心的第一个考验。
    站在九甸峡谷口燕子坪，眺望鹦哥嘴，你简直不敢想像人可以攀上悬崖。鹦哥嘴是个大的山嘴，从九甸山中间突出去，上面是隆起的，往洮河上空伸着，山嘴的尽头向下弯，像鹦哥的嘴。就在这个嘴底下，悬崖直立到洮河里，高达四百五十多米。人要爬到离洮河水面三百五十米的崖上，凿开一条小路，才能让更多的人站在上面打眼、放炮，把这个山嘴的一部分劈掉，再开出河道来。爬悬崖这件工作，对每个来自靖远的人都是生疏的，他们熟悉的是黄河的水，一望无边的黄土。
    最先爬上鹦哥嘴悬崖的，是共产党员康映辉、共青团员李珍。两个生龙活虎一样的青年，还不满二十三岁呢！两个人，腰拴一根长达一百多米的绳子，从上往下滑向悬崖。他们像壁虎一样贴在崖上，两手抓住崖上突出的石块，……。有时，他们贴住崖站在那里，有时，手脚都落空了，身子被绳子吊在空中旋转。他们每下降一寸，都要使出全身的气力，每下降一寸都存在着死亡的危险，而每下降一寸都在接近胜利！下到河道线了，没有办法打眼。脚不能踏实，人变的没有力量。放上了钎子，每打一锤，人都被抛开岩崖一次，而且摇晃的利害。不得已，他们又爬上了山嘴。怎么办呢？大家研究的结果，接受了张生福的意见：用两根绳子放下去，拴上一根木棒，横吊在悬崖上，人站在棍子上面工作。只能有这条路可走了。康映辉、李珍二次被吊下悬崖，拴上木棍，站在木棍上，开始了打眼工作。多么困难的劳动啊！棍子在空中来回摆动，站在上面的人时刻要保持身体的均衡，一不小心，身子向前倾头会碰在石头上，身子往后倾会掉在半空里，轻轻地打锤钎子进不了岩石，如果使上全身力气，一锤打下去，身子要摇动许多次才能打第二锤。从石崖的这边到石崖的另一边，有一块十二米宽的绝壁，那末人怎样才能横着通过这段石崖呢！康映辉、李珍在崖中间横拴一根绳子，人手抓住绳子，两脚登空，身子吊在绳子上，两只手倒换着从一边向另一边挪动。一次，李珍从绳子上过，刚挪到中间，一只手滑了，身子在空中旋了一个圈，几乎掉在洮河里，看见的人都出了一身汗。李珍怎么说呢：
  “我没有害怕过！”
    在这危险的环境中，人们从容地爬上爬下，抡起过千万次铁锤，出过多少次惊恐的汗，身体被许多次吊的麻木了，战胜过一次又一次要摔下山涧的危险。半个月的时间，才在悬崖的腰里劈开一条不到一尺宽的小路。接着更多的人被绳子吊着，站在这条小路上，开始了紧张的打眼工作。
    打眼，不是一件复杂的劳动，不过是一个人扶钎子，一个人打锤而已。可是，在这不到一尺宽的地方就特别困难了！人们不得不坐在那里，面对着脚下滚滚的河水，面对看去令人眩晕的深渊从事这种劳动。在这里打眼，没有比打脱了锤更危险了！一锤打不上，不是把扶钎子人的手打烂了，就是把钎子打到崖下去了，再不然就把打锤的人闪出悬崖了！每一锤都得一个小心。坐着，不是轻松的，会过早地给人带来疲劳。李珍受不了这个气，索性站起来，背紧贴着石壁，面对空中，把锤抡来抡去，锤锤都不落空，换来了“石壁虎”的绰号。打的眼大了，人可以坐在洞子里，继续往里面掏。可是，照李珍的说法：“更难了，头抬不起，锤举不起，腿伸不直，要受委屈！”他们还是干了！全体分三班，昼夜不停，轮流下洞子。铁锤的声音，在山谷中回旋，将洮河的水响声压下去了。这时，人们不知道苦，不知道困难，只想到节节取得胜利！一群青年人，为削平鹦哥嘴不惜余力。小小年纪的李珍，坐在洞子里，挥动八磅重的锤，一口气可以打五百六十次不停，工地上传为美谈。
    登上鹦哥嘴的英雄们，用勇敢的行动，给大家铺好了通向所有悬崖峭壁的道路。在他们的身后，人们登上了玉皇峰、野狐嘴、马宗山、黄风岭。九甸峡上空，腾起了铁锤的声音，悬崖上插满了红旗，爆破开始了！九甸山被摇撼着，烟雾塞满了峡谷，洮河的水每天承受成千上万吨石头的冲击，狼、豹子、鹞鹰那些深山密林的统治者都远走高飞了！
    这不是困难的结束，而是困难的开始。现在需要炸药、雷管、装药和点炮的技术。开始，九甸峡工段只十八个炮手能放小炮，半天炸一次，轰不掉四五公方石头。一会钎子没有了，一会炸药不够了，一会雷管用完了，困难一个接一个，像是故意考验靖远人的意志似的。大战九甸峡的一千五百名青年，展开了人人学爆破技术的运动。钎子少，想法改进钎头，想法提高凿进的效率。只是钎子头，就创造了两个棱的，三个棱的，月牙形的，荞麦粒形的，品字形的……无奇不有，每次改进，等于延长一次钎子的寿命。起初打的是干眼，后来改成湿眼，用水，浇温水、浇碱水、浇盐水、浇尿，每一种试验，都给打眼的人带来新的速度。放小炮、放大炮、放裂缝炮、放葫芦炮、放梅花排炮，由小到大，由单个到成群，每次的爆破都给人们带来新的记录。装黄药、装黑药，掺食盐、掺马粪、掺方解石……，寻找各种各样节省炸药、提高爆炸威力的方法，而每种方法都能从大山上剥掉更多的石头！人的智慧是无穷无尽的，人的意志是无法估量的，人的创造是无比大胆的！九甸山，遇见无法敌挡的对手了！
    二十一岁的何春保，二十六岁的关振才，一直走在无数个创造者的前面，令九甸山发抖！何春保，曾经因为尽放小炮苦闷过。“炸一点点，怎么行呢，干到那年去了！”那时，他和关振才两个人，几乎是装药、放炮的职业家了。到处装药，到处点炮，最紧张的时候，在山上一住四十天不下来，到处点火。一天，何春保攀着悬崖去点炮，看见石头中间有一道大的裂缝。灵机一动：在石缝里塞上炸药，不知怎么样！回来和关振才商量。关振才在炸石头上，从来不怕把事情闹大，一口赞成：“行，试试去”两个人选了一个石缝子，何春保腰拴一根绳子下到石缝里去装药，关振才拉住绳子保险。装上药，点不着了。两个人你上我下，检查了好几回，找不出毛病。天黑了，两个人跑下山，把电话机背上去摇，还是不响。这一夜，他们都没有睡好觉，天刚亮，带着一盒电池又上山，终于炸响了。一共装十斤药，炸下了二千四百公方。裂缝爆破在整个九甸山工地传开了，人们一面打眼，一面去寻找石头缝子。
    这两个人，从来不放松任何一个提高爆破动力的机会，从来都在设法创造。那时，雷管很缺。当何春保拿着手电筒上山的时候，突然有一种力量使他对着灯泡发呆了。他想：能不能利用灯泡做雷管呢？这是没有先例的，可是何春保既然想到，就能做到。他把灯泡卸下来，将前头的玻璃磨开一个小孔，撒一撮黑药在钨丝上，再撮上一点黄药，通上电流，利用钨丝的燃烧点炮。试验竟然成功了。这两个人，一直在创造中前进。我和他们见面时，他们已能装三点五吨炸药的大炮了。关振才笑着说：“只要有药，一炮能把九甸山掀掉！”
    大战九甸峡的几个战斗小队，他们的名字是东风、火花、钢铁、星火、红旗。他们工作的地点是：鹦哥嘴、玉皇峰、野狐嘴、狼嘴、马宗山、黄风岭。队名和山名门当户对。他们，全都是英雄，而每一个人都有一段传奇式的战斗故事。共青团员李敬顺，曾经创造过一口气打一千零五十锤不脱一锤的新纪录。八磅重的锤，每一锤都要举的很高，每打一锤都要使上全身的力气，这需要多大的决心和毅力啊！共青团员孟庆林，测量九甸峡修正的渠道线时，带着六个人，背着仪器爬遍了悬崖峭壁，九天的时间完成了任务。最后一天，正在一个悬崖上工作时，记录所有测量数字的笔记本子掉到崖下面去了。本子里装的是六个人的全部劳动成果。他毫不犹豫，被绳子吊着，坠下悬崖寻找本子。多么凑巧，笔记本被卡在从山崖伸出去的一棵小树上。这时，一阵微风，树枝微小的摆动，都可能使笔记本掉在洮河里。孟庆林轻轻地滑下崖，又轻轻地爬上小树，把笔记本拿了回来。这需要多大的冒险精神，需要多么沉着的心情，需要多么轻盈的动作，又需要多么坚强的意志啊！
    过去，洮河从九甸峡流过的时候，十几米宽的水流，拍击着悬崖，凶恶地咆哮着。现在，英雄们炸掉的石块，日夜不停地倾泻在洮河里，水流愈来愈小，声音愈来愈微弱了，它只剩下轻轻的喘息。在九甸峡，再听不见流水的轰鸣了，只能听见炮声和歌声，九甸山驯服地低下了头。（附图片）
