    多卖多买　放手交流　促进生产　满足需要
    第二次第三类商品交流大会开幕
    据新华社天津21日电　商业部和轻工业部联合召开的全国第二次第三类商品交流大会，20日在天津开幕。
    这次大会的主要任务是：签订今年第四季度和明年第一季度的第三类商品交流合同，进一步组织第三类商品的生产和交流，以适应国家生产建设和人民生活的需要。
    会议还要检查全国第一次第三类商品交流大会上签订的合同、协议执行情况，分析和解决执行中的问题，总结经验。同时，将广泛地交流、传授第三类商品的生产和加工技术，签订技术协作合同，使生产技术落后的地区赶上来。
    在20日的会议上，商业部副部长吴雪之讲了话。他指出：在上海召开的全国第一次第三类商品交流会闭幕以后，两个多月来，各地都根据在会上签订的合同，逐级安排生产，组织收购，促进了第三类商品的生产和流通，加强了城乡之间、地区之间、工商之间的协作关系。吴雪之要求各地代表继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，多卖多买，放手交流；发扬共产主义协作精神，产区要积极供货，销区要实事求是的要货，使产、需双方成交合同落实下来，达到促进生产、满足需要的目的。
    第三类商品是只没有直接纳入国家计划管理的商品。包括小宗土特产品，小宗水果，小宗药材，产量不大的蔬菜，小手工业品，以及扫帚、刷把、筐篮等日用杂品。
