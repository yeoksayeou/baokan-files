More on the Harms of Sweet Potato Vine Turning

    In our article "On the Field Management of Sweet Potatoes," we emphasized not turning the vines, which has aroused disagreement among many readers.

    In most sweet potato producing areas in China, there has always been a habit of turning the vines; foreign countries such as Japan also have the same habit. The reasons for believing that sweet potatoes need vine turning can be summarized into four points:

    ① Roots growing on the vines consume nutrients;
    ② Sweet potatoes growing on the vines divert nutrients, affecting the yield of tubers at the base;
    ③ In rainy conditions, vine turning can accelerate soil moisture evaporation and enhance ventilation and light penetration;
    ④ Vine turning can suppress excessive vegetative growth.

    We have different views on these issues.

    First, the roots growing on the vines are beneficial. There are two types of sweet potato roots in terms of origin: one is called the seed root or primary root, and the other is called adventitious root. Both seed roots and adventitious roots have the ability to absorb water and fertilizer, and both can form tubers. There is no essential difference between them, only a difference in location. Therefore, we say that the root system on the vines is beneficial, and they are "producers."

    Our multiple experiments have also proved that removing the roots growing on the vines will significantly reduce the plant's drought resistance.

    Second, will tubers growing on the vines divert nutrients and affect the yield of the main basal tubers? Since the root system on the vines also has the ability to absorb water and fertilizer, the plant's synthesis ability will be correspondingly improved. Therefore, tubers growing on the vines do not necessarily divert nutrients from the tubers at the base of the main vine. The former North China Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted three to four years of experiments with three varieties with long vines: Beijing Western Suburb Variety, Nonglin No. 4, and Victory No. 100. Vine turning resulted in yield reduction compared to not turning the vines. For Beijing Western Suburb Variety, the rate of large tubers (over 250 grams) was 91.82% without vine turning and 91.73% with vine turning; for Nonglin No. 4, the rate of tubers growing on the vines was 84.21% without vine turning and 80.45% with vine turning; for Victory No. 100, the rate of large tubers was 94.15% without vine turning and 95.27% with vine turning. This shows that tubers growing on the vines do not necessarily divert nutrients from the basal tubers. In 1959, we saw in a high-yielding field in Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangpu, Fujian, with a yield of 15,000 jin per mu, that tubers growing on the vines accounted for about one-fifth of the total yield. In 1958, the "Sweet Potato King" weighing forty jin in Liuwei Brigade, Gengche Commune, Suqian, had twenty jin of tubers growing on the vines.

    Third, although vine turning can accelerate soil moisture evaporation, it has great disadvantages. Recent observations have proved that the absolute soil moisture content of turned vines is 3% lower than that of unturned vines. Although this shows that vine turning does accelerate soil moisture evaporation, it also leads to yield reduction due to weakening the plant's root system and causing plant damage. Plant damage caused by vine turning is manifested in two aspects: one is mechanical damage, and the other is increased yellowing and leaf shedding. Recently, we investigated in Chengxi Brigade, Bawang Commune, Suqian, that after closing the ridges, each vine turning resulted in an average of about 200 jin of broken basal leaves per mu. It was also observed that the average soil temperature of vine turning from July 27 to August 2 was 31.4 degrees Celsius, while the average soil temperature of not turning the vines was 30.5 degrees Celsius. The more suitable temperature for nutrient transport in sweet potatoes is 25 to 28 degrees Celsius, and high soil temperatures will also affect nutrient transport. All of these indicate the harms of vine turning.

    Fourth, vine turning cannot suppress excessive vegetative growth. In the case of excessive vegetative growth, people often take vine turning measures to suppress it. Practice has proven that this is ineffective. The former North China Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted three to four years of experiments with varieties such as Victory No. 100, proving that vine turning cannot reduce the length of the main vine and the number of branches. The experiment also found that the number of new buds sprouted in the vines turned three times increased by 164.9% compared to the vines not turned. This shows that vine turning not only does not promote the storage of nutrients in the tubers but also causes more nutrients to be consumed in sprouting new buds.

    From the above reasons, vine turning has no benefits.

### 再谈甘薯翻藤的坏处

    再谈甘薯翻藤的坏处
    我们在“谈甘薯田间管理问题”一文中，强调不翻藤，引起了不少读者的异议。
    在我国绝大部分甘薯产区，一向就有翻藤习惯；国外如日本也有同样习惯。认为甘薯需要翻藤的理由，归纳起来有四点：
    ①藤上生的根要消耗养分；
    ②藤上结的薯块要分散养分，影响基部薯块的产量；
    ③在多雨情况下翻藤可以加速土壤水分蒸发，加强通风透光；
    ④翻藤可以压制茎叶徒长。
    对这些问题，我们有不同看法。
    第一，藤上生的根是有益的。薯根就其来源说有两种，一种叫做种根或初生根，另一种叫做不定根。种根和不定根都有吸水吸肥的能力，也都可以形成藤块，在本质上没有任何区别，所不同的只是位置罢了。因此，我们说藤上的根系是有益的，它们是“生产者”。
    我们的多次试验也证明，去除藤上生的根系就会显著降低植株的抗旱能力。
    第二，藤上结薯会不会分散养分，影响主基部薯块产量呢？藤上根系既然同样有吸水吸肥能力，植株合成能力就会相应的提高，因此藤上结薯不一定就要分散主藤基部薯块的养分。前华北农业科学研究所以长藤的北京西郊种、农林四号、胜利百号三个品种进行三至四年试验，翻藤都比不翻藤的减产。北京西郊种不翻藤的上薯率（250克以上的）为91.82％，翻藤为91.73％；农林四号不翻的藤上薯率为84.21％，翻藤的为80.45％；胜利百号不翻藤的上薯率为94.15％，翻藤的为95.27％。由此可见，藤上结薯并不一定会分散基部薯块的养分。1959年，我们在福建漳浦和平农业社一块亩产一万五千斤的丰产田中见到，藤上薯块约占总产量的五分之一。1958年宿迁耿车刘圩大队一株四十斤重的“甘薯大王”，其中有二十斤薯块是由藤上结的。
    第三，翻藤虽能加速土壤水分蒸发，但害处很大。最近我们观察证明：翻藤的比不翻藤的土壤绝对含水量降低了3％。这虽说明翻藤确有加速土壤水分蒸发的效果，但是由于翻藤会削弱植株根系和造成植株损伤引起减产。翻藤引起植株损伤表现在两方面：其一是机械损伤，其二是增加黄叶和脱叶。最近我们在宿迁霸王公社城西大队调查，在封垅以后，每翻藤一次每亩平均约折断基叶二百斤左右。还观察到，7月27日至8月2日这一阶段翻藤的平均土温为摄氏三十一点四度，不翻藤的为三十点五度。而甘薯养分运转较合适的温度是二十五至二十八度，地温高了也会影响养分的运转，这些都说明翻藤的害处。
    第四，翻藤不能压制茎叶徒长。在茎叶徒长的情况下，人们往往采取翻藤措施进行压制。实践证明，这是无效的。前华北农业科学研究所以胜利百号等品种作了三至四年试验，证明翻藤不能减低主藤长度和分枝数。试验中还发现翻藤三次的，植株萌发新芽数比不翻藤的增加164.9％。这说明翻藤不但没有促使养分贮入薯块，反而使养分更多的消耗于萌发新芽。
    从上述理由看来，翻藤是没有好处的。
