Breaking the Hell on Earth, Building a Happy Paradise
--An Investigation Report on the Rebel Leader Sokang Wangqing Gele Kaisong Creek Card
By our reporters Lin Tian, ​​Angwang Dingzeng, and Ma Jingqiu

	The Naitongzong area of ​​Shannan on the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River is a prosperous agricultural area in Tibet. We recently investigated the Kaisong Creek Card, a creek card (manor) originally belonging to Sokang Wangqing Gele, a rebel leader and large serf owner. The Sokang family has more than a dozen creek cards in agricultural areas such as the front Tibet, the back Tibet, and Shannan. The Kaisong Creek Card is one of his seven creek cards in Shannan (one of which is a pasture).

	Cruel by Nature, Starting by Plunder
	Kaisong Creek Card was established by Sokang's ancestors after taking advantage of the situation to seize the land here. The manor house is located in the center of the village. It is a three-story building where the "Xi Dui" (manor manager) sent by the Sokang family lives. Around the manor house are some dilapidated adobe houses where the serfs live. According to several elderly serfs, when the Sokang family built the manor house, they ordered all the working people in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the local Longhe Valley to do unpaid labor for their family. Thousands of male and female serfs lined up to carry stones and brought large timbers from far away. The manor house was designed by an old "Xin Sou Qiemo" (carpenter leader). After the manor house was completed, the Sokang family, fearing that the old man would design equally luxurious and extravagant buildings for other nobles, cruelly cut off his right arm.

	Three Kinds of Land, Three Kinds of Serfs
	Kaisong Creek Card has 1,660 ke of land, 63 serf households, and a total of 408 people, all managed by the serf owner's agent - "Xi Dui". The land is basically divided into three types:
	(1) Lord's "self-operated land". This kind of land is all good land, and is directly managed by Xi Dui on behalf of the lord. The "self-operated land" totals 652 ke, and is all cultivated by serfs paying "Ula" (unpaid labor), and all the harvest belongs to the lord. (2) Difference land. This kind of land is the allocated land that the lord distributes to the serfs for cultivation. The serfs who cultivate the difference land are called "Chaba", and they have to pay difference and taxes to the lord for generations. This creek card has about 676 ke of difference land. Although the income from the difference land belongs to the Chaba, they have to bear a series of heavy corvee taxes. (3) Lord's rented land. This kind of land totals 315 ke. One type is fixed rent land, called "Bo", totaling 111 ke, stipulating that each ke must pay 3.5 to 6 ke of rent grain per year. One type is half-rented land, called "Xie", totaling 204 ke. The lord and the serfs who rent the land share the harvested grain and grass equally. In addition to the above three types of land, there are also 17 ke of scattered small pieces of land with various names. Such as "Qiang Ren Xin" (wine money land), which is distributed to the foremen and plowmen on the lord's self-operated land for cultivation; there is also a kind of "Ula Xin", the income of which is rewarded to the foremen and "Ula".

	The serfs on the manor are basically divided into three types according to their social status:
	(1) "Chaba". The entire manor has 24 Chaba households, 160 people. In addition to paying Ula every year to cultivate the lord's self-operated land, the Chaba have many other burdens. They are attached to the difference land and transferred with the land. They are Chaba for generations. Only when they escape, go bankrupt, or have no offspring will Xi Dui take back the difference land and houses and re-assign them to other serfs. People from Chaba's family cannot leave the manor before the age of 60. If they want to leave, someone needs to replace them. For example, Chaba Xiluo's younger brother married into another lord's creek card from Kaisong Creek Card, and the wife's family sent someone to Kaisong Creek Card to replace him.
	(2) "Duiqiong". This is a type of serf without difference land. There are 39 households, 191 people. Their social status is inferior to that of Chaba. Some are Chaba who have gone bankrupt, and some have fled from other places due to famine. Among them, 11 Duiqiong households live by renting small pieces of land from the lord or Chaba; 23 households work part-time and cultivate small pieces of land or live entirely by working part-time; 2 households live by small handicrafts; and 3 households live by small handicrafts and begging. "Duiqiong" generally have to pay head tax to the lord, ranging from 3 to 15 liang of Tibetan silver per person per year, and more paying 5 ke of highland barley. At the same time, each household has to provide the lord with 6 days of short labor and several days of temporary corvee. Duiqiong can leave the manor for a short period of time. If they leave for a long time, they need the lord's permission, but they still have to return every year to pay taxes.
	(3) "Lang Sheng" and "Chayao", a total of 57 people. "Lang Sheng" are house slaves, specializing in housework. In addition to the manor manager having Lang Sheng, Zaxi, a large Chaba equivalent to a second landlord, also has Lang Sheng in his family. A few Chaba and individual Duiqiong families also have Lang Sheng, and the Lang Sheng in Chaba's families mainly do field labor. Lang Sheng's person belongs to the master, and there is no personal freedom at all. The daughter of a female Lang Sheng and the son of a male Lang Sheng must follow their parents for generations as Lang Sheng. Among the Lang Sheng of this creek card, 7 people inherited their parents as Lang Sheng, 7 people were beggars and wanderers who were taken in; 3 people were Lang Sheng from other places who could not bear the abuse and fled here to become Lang Sheng (this creek card also had Lang Sheng who fled), and several Lang Sheng were serfs who sold themselves to pay off debts or were sold by the lord to become Lang Sheng. "Chayao" are people who are transferred to make up for the difference. The Sokang family stipulates that each Chaba must have six laborers for each post of difference land (other large serf owners in the Shannan area generally have this regulation), of which two laborers work "year-round Ula" (serfs who provide unpaid labor for the serf owner year-round) on the lord's self-operated land, and four laborers cultivate the difference land and pay other corvee. If the number of laborers in a certain Chaba family is insufficient, Xi Dui will transfer people from other Chaba and Duiqiong to supplement it. This kind of person is called "Chayao". They are fed and clothed by the Chaba, but they serve as "year-round Ula" for the lord for life, cultivating the self-operated land for the lord without compensation. Chayao also have no personal freedom, and the sons of male Chayao and the daughters of female Chayao must continue to be Chayao. The master gives one liter of zanba (one-twentieth of a ke, one liter is less than one jin, and a small liter is only half a jin) every day, one piece of worn-out clothing a year, and a pair of cloth boots every three years. Or just give some rags to barely cover the body. There are more than 30 Chayao in the entire creek card. Among the 24 Chaba households, only 5 households do not have Chayao and Lang Sheng.

	Within the lord's manor, there is also a type of person called "Qisheng", who works for the lord outside the manor house. "Qisheng" includes: Genbo (small headman), one person, who manages the people of the entire creek card under Xi Dui, mainly responsible for assigning corvee. The lord gives a salary of 15 ke of highland barley per year. A small headman is set up in Kaduo Village, which is far from the manor house, with a salary of 17 ke. There are two "Le Ben", who are the foremen on the lord's self-operated land, supervising the year-round Ula labor, each with an annual salary of 33 ke. In addition, there are nine "Genie" (plowmen, who plow when cultivating the lord's self-operated land, each with an annual salary of 17 ke. Some are Duiqiong, some are Chaba.) and "Gebu" (manor house sweeper), "Linsong" (forest keeper), "Resong" (mountain keeper), and "Reze" (shepherd), one person each. They are all Duiqiong, each with an annual salary of 17 ke.
	These "Qisheng", in addition to their respective duties, can work at home in their spare time, and their children do not necessarily inherit their positions. Xi Dui also rents each "Qisheng" one or two ke of "Xie" land (half-rented). Among them, "Le Ben" and "Genie" each have a small piece (about one ke) of "Qiang Ren Xin" (wine money land), which is not subject to rent.

	From the economic situation of the serfs in this creek card, according to preliminary division, one household of Chaba and Duiqiong is equivalent to a second landlord, namely the large Chaba Zaxi. There are 5 people in this family, none of whom participate in labor; this large Chaba has 13 Lang Sheng and Chayao; cultivating one post of difference land (a post is a unit of land, about 30 ke in this creek card), renting in more than 40 ke of land; lending out 300 ke of high-interest loans. Eleven households are equivalent to middle peasants. Chaba in the middle peasants generally cultivate one post of difference land, have 2 to 5 Lang Sheng or Chayao, and owe hundreds of ke of high-interest loans. After the exploitation and exploitation are offset, the lord's (including the creditor's) amount of exploitation of them is still equivalent to 10% to 30% of their actual total income, and they are in deficit year after year. Duiqiong mostly rent one or twenty ke of land, or work part-time as "Bosheng". They are only exploited by the lord, and basically do not exploit others or be exploited among the serfs. Only one household took in a Lang Sheng.
	The remaining 51 Chaba and Duiqiong households are all poor peasants (including those who work part-time, and those who live by small handicrafts and begging). Among them, Chaba mostly cultivate half a post or one post of difference land, and some, although they have one to three Lang Sheng or Chayao, after offsetting the exploitation they receive from the lord, the lord's exploitation of them is still equivalent to more than 50% of their actual total income. The Duiqiong among them, in addition to providing labor service and paying head tax to the lord, also have to sell their labor to other serfs. These Chaba and Duiqiong are less dependent on others than Lang Sheng and Chayao, and their living conditions are not much different from Lang Sheng and Chayao.

	Among the means of production in the manor, in addition to the fact that all land belongs to the lord, most of the houses of the Chaba also belong to the lord, and only a small part are built by the Chaba on the lord's land. The Duiqiong rent or borrow the houses of the Chaba.
	Among the serfs in the entire creek card, except for the large Chaba Zaxi who has three oxen and large farm tools such as plows, none of them have oxen or large farm tools. The lord's manor house has thirteen oxen and large farm tools, which the serfs rent when cultivating. The Chaba and Duiqiong only have small farm tools such as hoes, sickles, and flails.
	The entire creek card has more than 300 large livestock such as horses, dairy cows, yellow cattle, and donkeys, of which more than 40 belong to the lord. Most of the rest belong to the Chaba, mainly for paying corvee. There are more than 500 sheep in the creek card, 180 belonging to the lord and more than 100 belonging to the large Chaba Zaxi.

	Four Major Categories of Exploitation Items
	The large serf owner's exploitation of the serfs can be roughly divided into four categories:
	The first category: the burden of serfs on the manor lord (including the lord's agent Xi Dui), generally called "Nei Cha".
	Each year, Sokang collects the following labor and materials from the serfs of this creek card through Xi Dui: 1. 4,500 ke of highland barley. 2. Five loads of flour (about 150 jin per load), three loads of zanba, two loads of buckwheat flour, five loads of green oil, half a load of green barley grains for making porridge, one fat pig, 1,000 eggs, 1,800 small bundles of hemp and soap pods (half a load in total), and a certain amount of wool rope and wool thread. 3. Of the 4,500 ke of highland barley transported to Lhasa each year, 500 ke are transported by this creek card. A total of 270 man-days and 1,350 animal-days are required. 4. Every year, transporting flour, zanba, green oil, and other sundries to Lhasa requires 108 man-days and 288 animal-days. 5. Each creek card of the Sokang family in Shannan is a transit station. The serfs of Kaisong Creek Card are responsible for transporting various materials of the Sokang family passing by, requiring 144 man-days and 528 animal-days. 6. Every year, transport timber to the Zhedang Ferry for Sokang. The number of man-days and animal-days depends on the needs. 7. When the Sokang family builds houses in Lhasa, they send Ula to his various creek cards. The Sokang family only provides the zanba to eat, without any other compensation. 8. The Sokang family sends five people to Kaisong Creek Card to settle accounts every year, taking 12 eggs per post of land, totaling 216. Only six are given one "Zhangga" of Tibetan silver (equivalent to one cent). When the Sokang family's mule team passes through the creek card, the cooking oil for the people and the grass for the mules and horses are borne by each household. 9. During the Lhasa Chuanzhao Festival, Kaisong Creek Card Chaba must send two running horses and three people to Lhasa to participate in the horse race for Sokang. 10. When the Sokang family comes to the creek card, the serfs have to give gifts.
	Among the corvee taxes levied by Sokang above, all human corvee, horse corvee, and pack animal corvee are dispatched by Xi Dui to the Chaba without compensation. The green oil required by Sokang has six ke of "rapeseed fixed rent land", rented to the Chaba, and each ke pays a large bucket of oil (about 40 jin). The eggs, hemp, soap pods, and other sundries required by Sokang are collected from the Chaba without compensation, or purchased at a low price (such as eggs).

	Intermediate exploitation by the lord's agent Xi Dui: 1. Exploitation of land management. All the labor of the 652 ke of the lord's self-operated land, from sowing to receiving grain into the warehouse, is borne by the Chaba sending year-round Ula and half-year Ula. This land receives 6,000 ke of grain. The lord's 332 ke of rented land receives 1,000 ke of rent each year. The two items total 7,000 ke of grain. In addition to handing over 4,500 ke of highland barley and dozens of ke of miscellaneous grains to Sokang, after deducting the expenses of the manor house, Xi Dui nets about 2,000 ke of grain each year. 2. Xi Dui asks 24 Chaba households for 30 ke of highland barley each year, nominally as a living allowance. 3. Xi Dui collects head tax from Duiqiong every year, 3 to 15 liang of Tibetan silver per person, and each household pays 6 or 7 days of short corvee. 4. Xi Dui collects 35 ke of highland barley from the Chaba every three years for "Ca Ren Cha" (beef tax, which is the money for Xi Dui to eat meat). 5. "Pa Ma Cha" (dairy cow tax), serfs pay 6 liang (about more than one jin) of butter in Tibetan weight to Xi Dui for each dairy cow they raise. 6. "Yue Re Cha" (corvee for twisting wool). Xi Dui distributes how much wool to the Chaba, and they pay how much thread. 7. Xi Dui goes to Qiongjie Zong to the market once a year, sending 15 livestock, taking several days to go back and forth. 8. Xi Dui goes to Sangri Zong to find a place for an exchange of agricultural and pastoral products once a year, sending three livestock, taking several days to go back and forth. 9. Xi Dui often sends serfs to act as messengers between him and Sokang, temporarily assigning them to serve as letter messengers, etc., many times. 10. The three Lang Sheng and seventeen Qisheng in the Xi Ka manor house are all under Xi Dui's control.
	The total of the above first type of exploitation (Nei Cha), all converted into grain, is about 7,700 ke of highland barley.

	The second category: the burden of serfs on the Gaxag (former Tibetan local government), called "Wai Cha".
	Although this is the private manor of the serf owner Sokang, in addition to paying corvee taxes to the direct lord, as "common people" under the unified jurisdiction of the former Tibetan local government, the serfs also have to pay corvee to the former Tibetan local government and its officials. This kind of difference is called "Wai Cha". The items are as follows: 1. Military service burden. Three regular military service (Tibetan soldiers), each paying 30 ke of grain rations per year, and 8 cheng of Tibetan silver for clothing expenses (50 liang per cheng). There are also two "Nianqiongwa" (ancient soldiers inspected during the Gaxag's conscription festival), each costing the equivalent of half a Tibetan soldier. 2. Chaba households need to send a total of 120 man-days and 360 animal-days each year to transport official grain for the Gaxag. 3. Chaba households take turns sending one person and two horse corvee every day for three months each year to the horse station to prepare for officials passing by to requisition at any time. 4. When the Gaxag's business mule team passes by each year, the Chaba have to pay 30 liang of Tibetan silver for food expenses. The cooking oil, tea, meat, etc. used by the six people in the mule team are apportioned to the Chaba. Firewood is also apportioned to the Chaba.

	The third category: high-interest loans. The serfs of the entire creek card owe a total of more than 6,000 ke of high-interest loan grain. The creditors include the lord Sokang, Xi Dui, nearby monasteries and upper-level lamas, large Chaba (second landlord), Gaxag, large monasteries in Lhasa, etc. The average interest rate is 14.3% per year. If the interest cannot be paid on time, the interest is added to the principal, and the interest is compounded. The Chaba owe the most debts, ranging from 100 to 200 ke per household to 400 to 500 ke. Most of them are old debts that cannot be paid off for generations. If they cannot pay interest and principal for a long time, they use cattle, sheep, and other properties to pay off the debt at a low price; if they have no property, they use the difference land to pay off the debt to the creditor for several years; if they lose the difference land, they use their person to pay off the debt, working as Lang Sheng for the creditor.
	The fourth category: religious burden. 1. "Pengba Cha": "Pengba" is a kind of highland barley used to worship gods. Every year, Kaisong Creek Card has to send one person and four horses to distribute "Pengba" to nearby temples. 2. "Se Cha" (hail tax): There is a Zequdeng Temple on the mountain east of Kaisong Creek Card, and a "Nala" (witch) lives on the mountain west of Kaisong Creek Card. Each manages half of the sky above the creek card. Every year, they chant scriptures to "block" hail. In the east, each small piece of land pays one liter of "Se Cha" highland barley to the temple every year. When the western land is harvested, each piece of land pays two bundles of highland barley to the "Nala" (bundled by the Nala with boot straps, as much as they can bundle), and the land in the middle pays "Se Cha" to both sides. If there is no hail, the credit goes to the temple and the Nala. If there is hail, they blame the women for singing in the fields, or the men for baring their backs in the fields, offending the heavens. 3. "Bushi" (insect tax). A nearby temple chants scriptures every year to "eliminate" insect pests. The entire creek card pays 5 ke of highland barley for chanting expenses every year. 4. Xi Dui invites lamas to chant scriptures every three years. When chanting scriptures, each household pays Xi Dui half a ke of highland barley or a certain amount of Tibetan silver. Each Chaba household invites lamas to chant scriptures once a year or every three years. In addition to providing food and drink for the lamas, they also have to give a certain amount of highland barley and Tibetan silver.

	The above Wai Cha, high-interest loans, religious burdens, etc., are converted into grain, totaling about 1,000 ke of highland barley. In total, the exploitation of the serfs by the three major lords is about 8,700 ke of grain, accounting for more than 60% of the serfs' total annual labor income (that is, everything created by the serfs' total labor, not referring to the serfs' actual income). From here, it can be seen that the working people of Tibet suffered deeply under the rule of the serf system. From birth to death, from head to toe, from earth to heaven, the serfs are exploited by the serf owners at all times and in all places. Except for individual second landlords who differentiated from the serfs and a very small number of people with slightly better lives (adding up to no more than 5% of the total population), 95% of the serfs were starving and suffering, and under the cruel exploitation of the three major lords, they even lost their families and homes and were displaced. For example, Gado, a 61-year-old mother who is a Lang Sheng in Sokang's manor house, originally belonged to Chaba. Her parents cultivated half a post (18 ke) of difference land and had to send two people to the lord to serve as year-round Ula and miscellaneous corvee. They were exhausted and hungry all year round and died one after another. Gado, in her twenties, and her husband and younger sister inherited their parents and became Chaba again. One year, her younger sister, who was a "year-round Ula", suffered from a serious illness, and her husband went out to pay corvee and did not return. Xi Dui forced Gado to replace her sister as Ula. Her younger sister lay at home with a high fever and no one cared for her, shouting "I'm thirsty! I'm going to die!" for half a month and then died. From then on, Xi Dui took back the difference land, houses, and even the pots and stoves, and Gado and her husband, Chilai Duojie, became Lang Sheng of the lord. Their little daughter and the child left by her younger sister grew to be eight or nine years old and were sent by Xi Dui to Chaba as Chayao. Chilai Duojie could not get enough to eat as Lang Sheng and was so hungry that he sometimes secretly grabbed a few handfuls of highland barley from a hole in the lord's warehouse. Five years later, Xi Dui discovered this, whipped him, and then put him in shackles for hard labor. Chilai Duojie could not bear the pain, broke the shackles and escaped, but was later caught by Xi Dui, who beat him to the point of near death and put him in "red shackles" (burning the iron red and hammering the interface into the ankle). Chilai Duojie, in his fifties, had the skin burned off his legs and soon rotted to death. From then on, the old mother shed blood and tears and served as a cook for Xi Dui in the kitchen for ten years until she was liberated after the rebellion was quelled. Another serf, Zaxi Wangjie, was unable to pay off his high-interest loan of 360 ke of grain to the lord, so Xi Dui whipped him, and he had to flee outside. Xi Dui sealed his house for two years and then assigned his difference land and house to a Chayao, Lazhu, stipulating that Lazhu would pay 105 ke of high-interest loan grain every year on behalf of the runaway serf. Lazhu paid corvee for forty years, paying more than 4,000 ke of high-interest loans. In the end, he could not pay corvee and repay the debt, and fled with his three children, wandering for five years. When he was sixty years old, he wandered back and asked someone to intercede, and Xi Dui allowed him to pay head tax and become a Duiqiong, living by working part-time and renting small pieces of land. We saw at a farmers' conference of the entire creek card that, except for the Zaxi family, there was not a single person in complete clothes among the more than 300 serfs, and not a single woman wearing shoes. Before the military control committee distributed relief grain and supplied oil, salt, tea, etc. at low prices, many families had run out of grain, many families had not tasted salt for a long time, and some children were malnourished from birth, unable to speak at the age of three or four, and looking like sick infants at the age of ten or more. Few elderly people over the age of fifty or sixty have complete facial features.

	Cruel Personal Servitude
	The cruel system of personal servitude made the working people of Tibet live an incomparably tragic life. Chaba and Duiqiong could not leave the manor at will, let alone get rid of their dependence on the lord. But generally speaking, they still had a home, and after completing the corvee taxes to the lord, they still lived as an economic unit with their own families. However, Lang Sheng and Chayao have no personal freedom at all. Now, let's see how the Lang Sheng of the serf owners' (including their agents') and large Chaba (second landlord) families live from birth to death.
	The children of Lang Sheng become little Lang Sheng at birth, but they do not have fixed rations before the age of three. The master only gives them some zanba paste to eat. After the age of three, they are given zanba flour. They start serving corvee at the age of seven or eight until the age of sixty, when they are driven away by the master. Wu Zhu Cuomu, a blind old mother begging in the manor, was driven out after being Lang Sheng after the age of sixty. Lang Sheng cannot live in houses. The stables, cowsheds, eaves, and roofs are their dwellings. They eat some coarse zanba and drink some tea root water, and wear a piece of worn-out clothing throughout the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the creek card manor, Qimei Cuomu, an old mother who originally raised dairy cows for Xi Dui, and her daughter have been Lang Sheng for three generations. When Qimei Cuomu was eight years old, her mother went blind and died of starvation, and she took over from her mother as Lang Sheng. Later, her daughter, Zhuoma Ciren, took over from her. The old mother cannot remember how many beatings and scoldings she has suffered in her life, nor can she remember the exact age of herself and her daughter. Her mother gave birth to her in the stable, and she gave birth to her daughter in the cowshed. The daughter gave birth to a granddaughter, but neither the mother nor the daughter had a husband, because Lang Sheng people do not have a marital family unless the husband and wife are in the same master's house. There is also a fifty-year-old Lang Sheng, Gesang, in the manor, who raises horses for Xi Dui. He has been in this manor since he was fifteen years old. For thirty-five years, regardless of wind or snow, he has always lived in the stable. He lives on the roof. Every time Xi Dui or his housekeeper goes out, if Gesang does not prepare the saddle to their satisfaction, he will be whipped or grabbed by the hair and bumped against the wall. This old man has been tortured to the point of being mentally disturbed.

	Serf owners have Lang Sheng, large Chaba have Lang Sheng, and some ordinary Chaba also have one or two Lang Sheng. The difference is that there is a strict master-slave relationship between the serf owners (or second landlords) and Lang Sheng, while the lives and labor of Lang Sheng in ordinary Chaba families are basically the same as those of Chaba. However, the Lang Sheng in Chaba families also have no personal freedom at all. Similar to "Lang Sheng" in social status and living conditions are "Chayao". Nima Ciren, a young Chayao in the family of the large Chaba Zaxi, was originally a Duiqiong in his father's generation. Later, he was transferred to Zaxi's family to serve as Chayao. When his father died, Nima Ciren took over from his father as Chayao at the age of eight. At that time, he was too young and was beaten by the master. He ran home and complained to his mother, and his mother went to beg the master not to beat him. The master said, "He is mine. I am willing to rub him into a ball and put him in my pocket, as I please! I am willing to pull him into a strip and wrap him around my waist, as I please!" The mother had no choice but to leave him behind and return home in tears. From here, the plight of the Chayao can be seen.
	Even more cruel is the direct and indirect killing of serfs by the serf owners and their agents. The former Xi Dui of Kaisong Creek Card once broke the arm of an old Lang Sheng. Ping Cuo Zhandui, the current Xi Dui's henchman (who used to be a poor Chaba himself), harmed four lives in less than ten years. One of the serfs was beaten to death simply for eating an ear of wheat in Xi Dui's field. The daughter of Duiqiong Cangjue was beaten by Ping Cuo Zhandui on the edge of the field for a handful of green grass, and the pregnant woman climbed home and died soon after. The newborn baby and a one-year-old child also starved to death immediately afterward. When Granny Cangjue accused Sokang and his henchmen of their crimes this time, she wept bitterly. The other two children left behind after her daughter's death also cried for their mother. The old woman said to the children, "You don't have a mother anymore. Your mother was eaten by wild beasts!"

	During the rebellion, the serfs of Kaisong Creek Card suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. This place was once the "Bo Kang" (grain station) of the rebels. The rebels killed cattle and caught sheep day and night, tortured the people, and raped women. Deqing Yuzhen, a sixteen-year-old girl, was raped by the bandits for more than ten days. Later, she fled to the mountains, and her whereabouts are still unknown. The younger brother of Duiqiong Ping Cuo Deji was beaten all over because he had worked as a temporary construction worker for the People's Liberation Army. The rebels threatened to kill him in front of his sister, and finally took him away. His fate is still unknown. At a grievance meeting, Lang Sheng Nima Ci Cai beat his chest and said: Our suffering is like river water, a hundred years, a thousand years, always flowing endlessly, and today is finally the end!

	Serfs Turn Over to Be Masters, Lang Sheng Liberated and Settled Down
	In mid-April, the working group of the military control committee came to Kaisong Creek Card. At that time, the serfs were all pale and thin, many families had run out of food, and there were no seeds for spring planting. Many people had not tasted oil or salt for months. The working group of the military control committee immediately distributed food and seeds, and rescued and supplied hundreds of catties of butter, salt, and tea, and announced that whoever plants the land in this manor this year will harvest it. The serfs recovered from the brink of death, and they rebuilt their homes with enthusiasm and made a big splash in spring plowing. All more than 1,000 ke of land in the entire creek card were sown in time.

	The preparatory committee for the first farmers' association in the Shannan area was established in Kaisong Creek Card. Four Lang Sheng, three Duiqiong, and two Chaba were elected as members. The director of the committee is Nima Ciren, a young man who has been Lang Sheng since he was eight years old, and the vice-chairmen are Awang, a poor Chaba, and Jiga, a 21-year-old girl who has been Lang Sheng for Xi Dui since she was a child. At the inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee of the farmers' association, we saw that these ragged and barefoot people, these men whose rotten shirts could not cover their shoulders, these women whose broken skirts could not cover their calves, stood up for the first time as their own masters after many years, and also raised their hands for the first time to elect their own representatives. After the election, Nima Ciren said, "Folks! The Communist Party is leading us to turn over. Everyone has chosen me, and I will definitely do my best to serve you." Jiga, a tall girl, said, "I didn't grow up eating zanba, I grew up being beaten and scolded. I will always be loyal to our working people and always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." The young people applauded, and the old women shed tears of excitement. Old man Lazhu stood up and said, "I have watched them suffer and sin since they could walk. With the Communist Party educating them, they will not lead us on the wrong path!" People applauded and cheered. The serfs of Kaisong Creek Card began to be their own masters.

	As soon as the preparatory committee of the farmers' association was established, the serfs, under the leadership of the preparatory committee and with the help of the working group of the military control committee, began the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee, anti-slavery, rent reduction and interest reduction). When we came to Kaisong Creek Card for the second time, walking into the large manor house, what replaced the original lifelessness was a vibrant scene.

	Lang Sheng and Chayao were liberated. Among them, those who originally had families returned home and reunited with their families, and 27 who originally did not have families settled down. More than a dozen households lived in the empty houses of the

　　打破人间地狱　建设幸福乐园
　　——叛乱头子索康·旺清格勒凯松溪卡的调查报告
　　本报记者　林田、昂旺丁增、马兢秋
    雅鲁藏布江南岸的山南乃东宗一带，是西藏富庶的农业区。我们最近在这里调查了叛乱头子、大农奴主索康·旺清格勒原来所属的一个溪卡（庄园）——凯松溪卡。索康家在前藏、后藏、山南等农业区有十几个溪卡，凯松溪卡是他在山南的七个溪卡（其中一个是牧场）中的一个。
    残忍成性，掠夺起家
    凯松溪卡是索康的祖先仗势霸占这里的土地后建立的。庄宅座落在村落的正中，是一幢三层楼房，索康家派的“溪堆”（庄园管理人）就住在这里。庄宅四周，是农奴们居住的一些破烂的土屋。据几位老年农奴说，当索康家建造庄宅的时候，曾命令当地所有的陇河谷上、中、下的劳动人民为他家作无偿劳役。成千上万的男女农奴，排成长阵搬运石块，并且从很远的地方抬来了大木料。庄宅是由一个老“辛叟切莫”（木工头）设计的。庄宅落成后，索康家唯恐这位老人给其他贵族设计出同样豪华、阔绰的楼房，就残忍地把他的右臂砍掉了。
    三种土地，三种农奴
    凯松溪卡有土地一千六百六十克，六十三户农奴，共四百零八人。由农奴主的代理人——“溪堆”全权管理。土地基本上分三种：
    （一）领主“自营地”。这种土地都是好地，由溪堆代领主直接经营。“自营地”共六百五十二克，全由农奴出“乌拉”（无偿劳役）耕种，收获全部归领主。（二）差地。这种土地就是领主分给农奴耕种的分地。种差地的农奴称为“差巴”，要世代为领主支差纳赋。这个溪卡约有差地六百七十六克。差地上的收入虽然归差巴，但他们要担负一系列繁重的差役贡赋。（三）领主出租地。这种地共有三百一十五克。其中一种是定租地，叫“博”，共一百一十一克，规定每克每年要交租粮三克半到六克。一种是对半分租地，叫“谢”，共二百零四克，收获的粮、草，领主和租地的农奴对半分。除以上三种土地外，还有十七克各种名目的零星小块土地。如“羌任薪”（酒钱地），是分给领主自营地上的工头、掌犁人等种的；还有一种是“乌拉薪”，收入是赏给工头和“乌拉”们的。
    庄园上的农奴，按他们的社会地位，基本上分三种：
    （一）“差巴”。全庄园有差巴二十四户，一百六十人。差巴每年除了出乌拉耕种领主的自营地以外，还有其他许多负担。他们附属在差地上，随土地转移，世世代代为差巴，只有当他们逃亡、破产或绝户以后，溪堆才收回差地和房屋，再分派给另外的农奴。差巴家的人，六十岁以前，不能离开庄园，如果要离开，需要有人顶替。如差巴希洛的弟弟，从凯松溪卡入赘到别的领主的溪卡，妻家就派了一个人来凯松溪卡顶替。
    （二）“堆穷”。这是一种没有差地的农奴。三十九户，一百九十一人。他们的社会地位次于差巴。有的是破了产的差巴，有的是从别处逃荒来的。其中有十一户堆穷靠租种领主或差巴的小块土地生活；作短工兼种小块土地和全靠作短工为生的二十三户；以小手工业为生的二户；小手工业兼乞讨为生的三户。“堆穷”一般都要向领主交纳人头税，每年每口少的交藏银三两到十五两，多的交青稞五克。同时每年每户要给领主支短差六天，不在规定之内的临时差役若干天。堆穷可以短期离开庄园。如长期离开，需得领主允许，但每年仍要回来支差纳税。
    （三）“朗生”和“差徭”，共五十七人。“朗生”即家奴，专作家务劳役。除庄园管理人有朗生外，相当二地主的大差巴扎西家内也有朗生。少数差巴和个别堆穷家里也有朗生，而差巴家里的朗生主要是做田间劳动。朗生人身属于主人，完全没有人身自由，女朗生的女儿、男朗生的儿子必须各随父母世代为朗生。这个溪卡的朗生，有七人是继承父母为朗生的，七人是讨饭流浪被收容的；三人是外处朗生，不堪虐待，又逃到这里作朗生的（本溪卡也有朗生外逃），还有几个朗生是农奴自己卖身抵债或被领主出卖为朗生的。“差徭”是被抽调补差的人。索康家规定，差巴每种一岗差地，必需有六个劳动力（山南地区其他大农奴主也大体上有这种规定），其中有两个劳动力在领主自营地上作“常年乌拉”（常年为农奴主作无偿劳役的农奴），四个劳动力种差地和支其他差役。如果某家差巴的劳动力名额不足，溪堆就从其他差巴、堆穷中抽调人补充。这种人就叫“差徭”，他们由差巴管吃穿，但是世代终身给领主当“常年乌拉”，为领主无偿地耕种自营地。差徭同样没有人身自由，而且男差徭的儿子、女差徭的女儿，必须继续作差徭。主人每天给一升糌粑（一克的二十分之一，一升不足一斤，小升只半斤多点），一年一件破衣服，三年一双布靴子。或是随便给些破衣烂裳，免强遮体。全溪卡共有差徭三十多人。二十四户差巴中，只五户没有差徭和朗生。
    领主庄园内还有一种叫做“其生”的人，这种人给领主干庄宅外面的活。“其生”中包括：根保（小头人）一人，在溪堆之下管理全溪卡百姓，主要负责派差。领主每年给工薪青稞十五克。在离庄宅较远的卡多村设小头人一名，工薪十七克。“勒本”二人，即领主自营地上的工头，监督常年乌拉劳动，每人每年工薪三十三克。此外，还有“格聂”九人（即掌犁人，在耕种领主自营地时，由他们掌犁，每人每年工薪十七克。有的是堆穷，有的是差巴。）和“格布”（庄宅扫地人）、“林松”（守林人）、“惹松”（守山人）、“惹泽”（牧羊人）各一人。他们都是堆穷，每人每年工薪十七克。
    这些“其生”除各有职守外，剩余时间可在家里劳动，子女不一定继承。溪堆还租给每个“其生”一、二克“谢”地（对半分租）。其中“勒本”和“格聂”各有一小块（一克左右）“羌任薪”（酒钱地），不交租。
    从这个溪卡农奴的经济状况看，据初步划分，差巴和堆穷中，相当于二地主的一户，即大差巴扎西。本家人口五人，全不参加劳动；这个大差巴有十三个朗生和差徭；种差地一岗（岗是土地单位，这个溪卡一岗约为三十克），租入地四十多克；放高利贷三百克。相当于中农的十一户。中农中的差巴一般种一岗差地，有二到五名朗生或差徭，欠几百克高利贷，被剥削和剥削两者相抵，领主（包括债主）对他们的剥削量，仍相当于他们实际总收入的10％到30％，年年入不敷出。堆穷多租种一、二十克土地，或兼作“波生”。他们只受领主剥削，在农奴之间，基本上不剥削别人，也不受剥削，只有一户收容了一个朗生。
    其余五十一户差巴和堆穷，都是贫农（包括作短工的，以小手工业和乞讨为生的）。其中差巴多种半岗或一岗差地，有的虽有一到三个朗生或差徭，和他们所受领主剥削相抵后，领主对他们的剥削仍相当于他们实际总收入的50％以上。其中的堆穷，除给领主服劳役和交人头税外，还要出卖劳动力给其他农奴。这些差巴和堆穷的人身依附程度轻于朗生和差徭，生活和朗生、差徭差别不大。
    庄园里的生产资料，除土地全属领主外，差巴的房屋也大部属于领主，只有一小部分是差巴在领主的土地上修的。堆穷则租用或借用差巴的房屋。
    全溪卡农奴中，除大差巴扎西有三头耕牛和犁等大农具外，都没有耕牛和大农具。领主庄宅里有十三头耕牛和大农具，农奴耕种时租用。差巴和堆穷，只有鹤嘴锄、镰刀、槤枷等小农具。
    全溪卡有马、奶牛、黄牛、驴等大牲畜三百多头，其中属于领主的四十多头。其余大部属于差巴，主要用于支差。溪卡内有羊五百多只，领主一百八十只，大差巴扎西一百多只。
    剥削项目四大类
    大农奴主对农奴的剥削，大体上可以分成四类：
    第一类：农奴对庄园领主（包括领主代理人溪堆）的负担，一般叫“内差”。
    索康每年通过溪堆向这个溪卡的农奴征用如下劳役和实物：一、青稞四千五百克。二、面粉五驮（每驮一百五十斤左右）、糌粑三驮、荞麦面二驮、青油五驮、作稀饭的青贮青稞麦粒半驮、肥猪一口、鸡蛋一千个、麻和皂角各一千八百小把（共半驮），以及毛绳毛线若干。三、每年运往拉萨的四千五百克青稞中，有五百克由本溪卡负责运送。共需人工二百七十个，畜工一千三百五十个。四、每年向拉萨运送面粉、糌粑、青油等杂物，需人工一百零八个，畜工二百八十八个。五、索康家在山南的每个溪卡都是一个转运站。凯松溪卡的农奴要负责转运来往路过的索康家的各种物资，共需人工一百四十四个，畜工五百二十八个。六、每年给索康运木料到泽当渡口，人工、畜工按需要而定。七、索康在拉萨修建房屋时，向他的各个溪卡抽派乌拉，索康家只管吃的糌粑，无任何其他代价。八、索康家每年派五个人到凯松溪卡结账，平均每岗地索取十二个鸡蛋，共二百一十六个。每六个只给藏银一“章噶”（合一分钱）。索康家的骡帮在溪卡过路时，人吃的酥油和骡马用草，由各家负担。九、拉萨传召时，凯松溪卡差巴要派出两匹走马，三个人到拉萨替索康参加赛马。十、索康家的人来溪卡时，农奴们要送礼。
    以上索康征用的差役贡赋中，凡人差、马差、驮畜差等，溪堆都无代价地向差巴支派。索康所要青油，专有六克“油菜定租地”，租给差巴，每克交油一大桶（四十斤左右）。索康要的鸡蛋、麻、皂角等杂物，无代价地向差巴征收，或低价征购（如鸡蛋）。
    领主代理人溪堆的中间剥削：一、经营土地的剥削。六百五十二克领主自营地从下种到收粮入仓，全部劳作由差巴派出常年乌拉和半年乌拉负担，这项土地收粮六千克。领主的三百三十二克出租地，每年收租一千克。两项共收粮七千克，除上交索康青稞四千五百克和杂粮几十克以外，扣除庄宅开支，溪堆每年净得粮食二千克左右。二、溪堆每年向二十四户差巴要青稞三十克，名义为生活补助费。三、溪堆每年向堆穷收人头税，每口人三到十五两藏银，每户支短差六、七天。四、溪堆每三年向差巴征“擦任差”（牛肉税，即溪堆吃肉的钱）青稞三十五克。五、“帕马差”（奶牛税），农奴每养一头奶牛，向溪堆交税酥油藏秤六两（约一斤多）。六、“约惹差”（搓毛线的差役）。溪堆给差巴发多少毛，就交多少线。七、溪堆每年到穷结宗赶集一次，派牲口十五头，往返数天。八、溪堆每年到桑日宗找地方进行一次农牧产品交换，派牲口三头，往返数天。九、溪堆与索康之间来往，临时派农奴作信差等，次数很多。十、溪卡庄宅里的三名朗生和十七名其生，都归溪堆支配。
    以上第一类剥削（内差）总计，全部折成粮食，约合青稞七千七百多克。
    第二类：农奴对噶厦（原西藏地方政府）的负担，称为“外差”。
    这里虽然是农奴主索康的私人庄园，但农奴除向直接领主支差纳赋外，作为原西藏地方政府统一管辖下的“百姓”，还要给原西藏地方政府及其官员支差，这种差叫“外差”。名目如下：一、兵役负担。三名常年兵役（藏兵），每名每年粮饷青稞三十克，被服费藏银八秤（每秤五十两）。另有两名“年穷娃”（噶厦点兵节时供检阅的古装兵），每名费用等于半个藏军。二、差巴户每年共需出人工一百二十个和畜工三百六十个给噶厦运官粮。三、差巴户每年有三个月每天轮流派人差一名，马差两个，到马站备过路官员随时支用。四、噶厦作生意的骡帮每年路过时，差巴们要出饭费藏银三十两，骡帮中有六个人所用的酥油、茶叶、肉等，向差巴摊派。柴草也向差巴摊派。
    第三类：高利贷。全溪卡农奴，共欠高利贷粮六千多克。债主有领主索康、溪堆、附近寺院和上层喇嘛、大差巴（二地主）、噶厦、拉萨大寺院等。平均贷息为借七还八。即年利（有的是春借秋还，只半年）14.3％；如到期付不起利息，又将息作本，利上加利。欠债最多的是差巴，少的每户一、二百克，多的四、五百克，大都是世世代代还不清的老债。如果长期不能付利还本，便以牛羊等财产低债；无财产即以差地当给债主若干年抵债；差地也失掉的，即以人身抵债，给债主作朗生。
    第四类：宗教负担。一、“朋巴差”：“朋巴”是一种供祭神用的青稞。凯松溪卡每年要派一个人、四匹马，把“朋巴”分送到附近各寺庙。二、“色差”（冰雹税）：凯松溪卡东面山头有个则曲登寺，西面山头上住着个“那拉”（巫人），两方各掌管溪卡半壁天，每年诵经“挡”冰雹。东部每小块地每年给寺庙交“色差”青稞一升。西部地收获时，每块地给“那拉”交青稞两捆（由那拉用靴带捆，捆多少是多少），中间的田地两方都交“色差”。如果不下雹，功归寺庙和那拉，下了雹，就怪妇女们在田里唱了歌，或男人们在田里赤了背。触犯了天公。三、“卜师”（虫税）。附近一个寺庙每年念经“消”虫灾，全溪卡每年交念经费青稞五克。四、溪堆每三年请喇嘛念一次经，念经时每户向溪堆交青稞半克或藏银若干。各差巴户每年或三年请喇嘛念经一次，除管喇嘛吃喝外，还要给青稞和藏银若干。
    以上外差、高利贷、宗教负担等折合粮食约一千克青稞。总计三大领主对农奴的剥削，约合八千七百多克粮食，占农奴全年全部劳动收入（即农奴全部劳动创造的东西，不是指农奴的实际收入）的60％以上。从这里，可以看出西藏劳动人民在农奴制度的统治下所受的深重苦难，农奴们从生到死，从头到脚，从地到天，无时无处不受农奴主剥削。除个别从农奴中分化出去的二地主和极少数生活略宽裕的人外（加在一起，不超过全部人口的5％），95％的农奴饥寒交迫，在三大领主的残酷剥削下甚至家破人亡、流离失所。例如索康庄宅里的朗生、六十一岁的老妈妈噶多，家里原来是差巴。她的父母种半岗（十八克）差地，要出两个人给领主作长年乌拉和支杂差，终年劳累饥饿，后来相继死去了。二十多岁的噶多，和丈夫、妹妹，又继承父母当了差巴。有一年，当“常年乌拉”的妹妹害了重病，丈夫外出支差未回，溪堆就逼着噶多代替妹妹当乌拉。妹妹发高烧躺在家里没人管，整天喊着“渴呀！我快死吧！”喊叫了半个月死去了。从此，溪堆就把差地、房屋连同锅灶一起收回，噶多和丈夫迟来多杰就都成了领主的朗生。他们的小女儿和妹妹留下的孩子长到八、九岁，也都被溪堆派给差巴作了差徭。迟来多杰当朗生吃不饱，饿得没办法，有时悄悄从领主仓库一个洞里抓几把青稞，五年后溪堆发觉了这件事，打了他一顿皮鞭，然后带上脚镣作苦役，迟来多杰痛苦难熬，砸断脚镣逃走，但后来被溪堆捉住，溪堆把他打得死去活来，上了“红脚镣”（把铁烧红，接口打死在脚脖上）。五十多岁的迟来多杰两腿被烧脱了皮，不久就活活烂死。老妈妈从那时起，又流着血泪，在灶房里给溪堆当了十年厨子。直到叛乱平息后才获得自由。另一个农奴扎西旺杰，因为欠了领主三百六十克粮的高利贷还不清，溪堆就打了他一顿皮鞭，他不得不逃走在外。溪堆把他的家封了两年，然后又把他的差地、房屋派给一个差徭拉珠，规定拉珠每年代替逃跑的农奴付高利贷利息粮一百零五克。拉珠就这样支差支了四十年，付了四千多克粮的高利贷。最后他也无法支差还债，带着三个孩子逃亡，流浪了五年，到六十岁的时候才流浪回来，托人说情，溪堆才准他交人头税作堆穷。靠作短工和租种小块土地活命。我们在一次全溪卡的农民大会上看到，除扎西家的人以外，三百多个农奴中找不出一个穿整齐衣服的人，也找不出一个穿着鞋子的妇女。在军管会没有发放救济粮和低价供应油、盐、茶等以前，许多人家已经断了粮，许多人家很久没尝到盐味，有些孩子，因为一生下来就营养不足，三、四岁还不会说话，十多岁还像个生病的婴儿。五、六十岁以上的老人，很少有五官健全的人。
    残酷的人身奴役
    残酷的人身隶属制度，使西藏劳动人民过着难以比拟的悲惨生活。差巴、堆穷都不能随便离开庄园，更不能摆脱他们对领主的隶属关系。但一般说来，他们总还有个家，在完成对领主的差役贡税之后，还是以自己的家庭为经济单位而生活的。而朗生和差徭，则完全没有人身自由。现在，让我们看看农奴主（包括其代理人）和大差巴（二地主）家的朗生，从生到死，是怎样生活的。
    朗生的子女一生下来就成了小朗生，但三岁以前却没有固定的口粮，主人只给些糌粑糊糊吃。三岁以后，才给糌粑面。七、八岁就开始服劳役，直到六十岁时，就被主人赶走。庄园里有个讨饭的瞎老妈妈乌珠错姆，就是当朗生到六十岁以后被赶出来的。朗生不能住房子，马棚、牛圈、檐下、房顶，就是他们的住处。他们吃些粗糌粑，喝些茶根水，春夏秋冬就是一身破衣服。在溪卡庄宅里，一个原来给溪堆养奶牛的老妈妈其美错姆，母女三代作朗生。其美错姆八岁时，她母亲眼瞎病饿而死，她便接替母亲作朗生，后来女儿卓玛次仁又接替了她。老妈妈一生中，记不清挨了多少打骂，也记不起自己和女儿的确切年龄。母亲在马棚里生了她，她又在牛圈里生了女儿，女儿又生了外孙女，但是母女俩都没有丈夫，因为作朗生的人，除非夫妻在一个主人家，是没有夫妻家庭的。庄宅里还有一个五十岁的朗生格桑，是给溪堆养马的。他从十五岁到这个庄宅，三十五年来，不管刮风下雪，一直是住在马棚里，他住在棚顶，每次溪堆或他的管家外出的时候，如果格桑拉马备鞍不顺他们的意，就遭皮鞭抽打，或是被抓住头发向墙上碰，这位老人已被折磨得有点神经失常了。
    农奴主有朗生，大差巴有朗生，一般差巴有的也有一两名朗生。所不同的，是农奴主（或二地主）与朗生之间有严格的主奴关系，而一般差巴家的朗生，生活、劳动基本上和差巴一样。不过差巴家的朗生，也完全没有人身自由。社会地位、生活境遇，和“朗生”相似的，还有“差徭”。大差巴扎西家一个青年差徭尼玛次仁，父亲一代原是堆穷，后来被抽调到扎西家当差徭，父亲死了，尼玛次仁八岁就接替父亲当差徭。那时他年纪太小，挨了主人打，就跑回家向着母亲哭诉，母亲便去哀求主人不要打他，主人说：“他是我的，我愿意把他搓成团，装在兜里，随我！我愿意把他拉成条，围在腰里，也由我！”母亲只好把他留下，含泪回家。从这里，可以看出差徭的处境。
    然而更残酷的，是农奴主和他的代理人直接、间接对农奴的杀害。凯松溪卡的前任溪堆就曾把一个年老的朗生打断了臂。这一任溪堆的狗腿子凭错占堆（本人过去是穷差巴），不到十年里就残害了四条人命，其中有一个农奴仅仅为了吃了溪堆田里一株麦穗，就被活活打死。堆穷苍觉的女儿，为了一把青草的事，被凭错占堆在田边打得鲜血淋淋，这个怀孕的妇女爬回家后不久就死了。刚生下的婴儿和一个一岁多的孩子也紧接着饿死了。苍觉老婆婆这次在控诉索康和他的狗腿子们的罪行的时候，痛哭流涕，女儿死后留下的另两个孩子，也哭着要妈妈。老婆婆向孩子说：“你们没有妈妈了，妈妈被野兽们吃掉了！”
    叛乱期间，凯松溪卡的农奴又遭到空前的浩劫，这里曾一度成为叛匪的“波康”（粮饷站）。叛匪在这里日夜杀牛捉羊，拷打人民，奸淫妇女。一个十六岁的小姑娘德庆玉真被匪徒们奸污了十多天，后来她逃到山里，至今不知下落。堆穷凭错德吉的小弟弟，只因曾给解放军作过临时建筑工人，叛匪就把他打得遍体鳞伤，在他姐姐面前声言要杀死他，最后把他带走，至今不知死活。在一次诉苦会上，朗生尼玛次才捶着胸膛说：我们的苦，像河水一样，一百年，一千年，总是流不断头，今天，才最后到头了！
    农奴翻身作主，朗生解放安家
    4月中旬，军管会工作组来到了凯松溪卡。当时，农奴们个个面黄肌瘦，许多人家断了口粮，没有春播的种子。许多人几个月没吃到油、盐。军管会工作组马上发放了口粮和种子，救济和供应了数百斤酥油、盐巴和茶叶，并宣布这个庄园的土地今年谁种谁收。农奴们从濒临死亡中复苏了，他们满怀热情地重建家园，大闹春耕生产。全溪卡一千多克土地都及时播了种。
    山南地区的第一个农民协会筹备委员会在凯松溪卡成立了。四个朗生、三个堆穷、两个差巴，被选为委员。主任委员是从八岁起作朗生的青年尼玛次仁，副主任委员一个是穷差巴阿旺，一个是从小给溪堆当朗生的二十一岁的姑娘基嘉。在农民协会筹委会成立大会上，我们看到，这些衣服褴褛、蓬头赤脚的人们，这些烂衫盖不住肩膀的男人，破裙遮不住脚杆的妇女，多少年来第一次站立起来作自己的主人，也是第一次举起手来选举他们自己的代表。在选举以后，尼玛次仁说：“乡亲们！共产党领导我们要翻身了，大家挑上了我，我一定好好为大家办事。”高高个儿的姑娘基嘉说：“我不是吃糌粑长大的，我是挨打受骂长大的，我永远忠实于我们劳动人民，永远跟着毛主席、共产党走。”青年们鼓掌，老婆婆流下了激动的眼泪。老大爷拉珠站起来说：“从他们会走路的时候，我就眼看着他们受苦受罪长大的，有共产党教育他们，他们是不会向坏道上领我们的！”人们鼓掌欢呼起来。凯松溪卡的农奴们开始自己当家作主了。
  农民协会筹委会一成立，农奴们就在筹委会的领导和军管会工作组的帮助下，开始了“三反双减”（反叛乱、反乌拉差役、反奴役、减租减息）运动。当我们第二次来到凯松溪卡的时候，走进大庄宅，代替原来死气沉沉的，是一片生气蓬勃的景象。
    朗生和差徭解放了，其中原来有家的回家和家人团聚了，二十七个原来没家的安了家。大庄宅的空房子里，就住了十几户，楼上楼下，热热闹闹。我们走进一户新的家庭，三姊弟正坐在一起吃饭。姐姐多吉，是个二十四岁的姑娘，弟弟多不金，二十一岁，还有个十三岁的小妹妹。这个小妹妹不满一岁的时候，她们的父母就死了。溪堆收回了她们家的差地和房屋。姊弟三人先后作了三户差巴的朗生和差徭。过去，她们偶而碰到一起的时候，擦着眼泪说不到几句话就得分开。现在她们团聚在一起，有了家。安家的当天晚上，三姊弟兴奋得睡不着觉，商量着今后的生活。隔壁就住着基嘉，这个从十二岁起就接替死去的母亲，给溪堆当朗生的姑娘，曾经多少次梦想冲出像囚笼一样的大庄宅，摆脱屈辱和打骂，曾多次向溪堆要求交人头税，好让她出去作堆穷，但是得到的只是训斥和恶骂。现在，她的梦想实现了，而且比梦想还更好。开会回来，她坐在毛垫子上喝着酥油茶，和前来祝贺的人说说笑笑。从八岁就被溪堆拉去派给大差巴扎西作差徭的尼玛次仁，现在回到了老母亲跟前，两年前和他偷偷相爱的一个外村的女朗生，也搬到他家来了。
    差巴家里的朗生解除人身依附关系，是通过开会协商的特殊方式实现的。取消乌拉差役后，差巴都愿意恢复朗生的人身自由，并且愿意帮助他们安家。每户差巴都送给朗生一些口粮、家具和小牲畜。如差巴乌珠平措家原有四个朗生和差徭，现在其中一个十三岁的男孩子打洛回家了；两个没家的女朗生都安了家。乌珠平错送他们各几克口粮，一两条驴子和山羊，还有些盆盆罐罐。还有一个朗生旺真是个残废，留在乌珠平错家里，和他家里人同样生活。庄宅里的一些家具杂物，也分给了安家的人们。
    乌拉差役取消了。农民协会筹委会领导朗生、差徭和没地的堆穷，经管领主的自营地。他们的劳动情绪非常高涨。
    大庄宅里，一个木匠作了许多供孩子们用竹笔练字的小黑板，一间大房子已经打扫好了，小学还没开学，一到傍晚，孩子们就自动跑来学唱歌。每到晚上，男女农民们就坐在一起“挖穷根”、“挖苦根”。过去这些不准有自己独立的行动和思想的人，现在谈论着这样一些问题：我们过去的痛苦、灾难是谁造成的？是命里注定的吗？要彻底翻身该怎么办？
    最近，凯松溪卡的农民协会已经正式成立，大家仍然选举了他们第一次挑中的那些人，又增加了一名堆穷作副主任。我们问一个作了二十年“格聂”（掌犁人）的堆穷格林巴珠：“人们对分地有什么看法和想法？”他说：“大家都在等着呢！要是把地分给种地的人自己，我担保田里一根草刺也不会有的。”
    在这个古老庄园里，到处一片生机，我们看到受尽苦难的西藏劳动人民，崭新的生活已经开始了。一个新西藏已经在祖国大家庭里出现。让那些亡命他乡的反动大农奴主和他们的卫士们去哭泣吧！
