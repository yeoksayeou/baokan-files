　　The Victory of Revolutionary Will
　　The science education film "Ode to Life" records an unprecedented miracle in the history of medicine. Qiu Cai Kang, a stoker at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, was burned by steel molten at a temperature of 1,300 degrees Celsius. The patient was sent to Guangci Hospital, affiliated with the Shanghai Second Medical College. The injury was very severe. Could he be cured? Thus, a fierce battle unfolded.
　　According to reports from American burn experts, the mortality rate for burns covering more than 70% of the body is 100%. The patient in front of us had burns covering 89.3% of his body. Should we believe in authority and treat the patient passively, doing our best within the limits of possibility, or should we break with superstition, liberate our minds, and mobilize the strength of the masses to treat him actively? The Party supported the bold and daring young doctors; it educated the medical staff with a class perspective, promoted revolutionary humanitarianism in rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, and implemented the spirit of serving the workers and peasants, snatching Comrade Qiu Cai Kang's life from the brink of death, and snatching Comrade Qiu Cai Kang's leg from the clutches of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When, five months ago, we saw Comrade Qiu Cai Kang healthy and happily attending the Shanghai Second Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference, how could we not cheer for the great victory of the Party's leadership in scientific and health work?
　　Comrade Qiu Cai Kang said to the doctors: "You must save me. The steel furnace needs me. I can let go of my wife and children, but I can't let go of the furnace." When he saw his loved one, the first thing he asked was: "Has my Party membership fee been paid for me?" How can we not be moved by Comrade Qiu Cai Kang's noble qualities of infinite loyalty to the Party and the people's cause? (Yuan)

    革命意志的胜利
    科学教育片“生命的凯歌”纪录下了一场医学史上空前未有的奇迹。上钢三厂司炉长丘财康同志被一千三百度高温的钢水烫伤了。病人被送到上海第二医学院附属广慈医院。伤势十分严重，能不能治好呢？于是，一场激烈的斗争展开了。
    根据美国烫伤权威的报告，烫伤面积在70％以上的死亡率是100％。眼前的病人烫伤面积已达到89.3％。是迷信权威，对病人作消极的尽人事的治疗，还是破除迷信，解放思想，发动群众的力量积极治疗呢？党支持了敢想敢干的年轻的医生们；用阶级观点教育了医务工作者们，发扬了救死扶伤的革命人道主义，贯彻了为工农服务的精神，从死亡的边缘夺回了丘财康同志的生命，从绿脓杆菌嘴里夺回了丘财康同志的腿。当五个月以前，我们看到丘财康同志健康而愉快地出席上海市第二届青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的时候，我们怎能不为党领导科学卫生事业的巨大胜利而欢呼呢？
    丘财康同志对医生说：“你一定要救活我，炼钢炉前需要我，妻子、儿子我都放得下，可是炉子放不下。”当他见着爱人时，第一句话就问：“党费替我交了没有？”我们怎能不为丘财康同志的对党和人民事业无限忠心的高贵品质所激动呢？　（沅）
