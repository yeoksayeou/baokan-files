　　Further Improve the Quality of Pig Iron from Small Blast Furnaces
　　By a commentator of this newspaper
    Small blast furnaces are the product of the Great Leap Forward upsurge in 1958. Although less than a year has passed, they have grown and strengthened rapidly, forming a powerful new force on the front line of China's iron smelting industry. At present, in terms of production, small blast furnaces undertake almost the same tasks as large and medium-sized blast furnaces. Without such a force, China's iron smelting industry could not have achieved such a high rate of development as it has today.
    No new thing can be perfect in its early stages of growth. However, as long as we actively support it and help it, we can make it progress rapidly. The fact that the quality of pig iron from some small blast furnaces is not good enough is also an inevitable thing in the process of small blast furnaces' growth. However, as long as we actively take measures, we can rapidly improve the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, so that they can keep pace with large blast furnaces. The news published in this newspaper today about the rapid improvement of pig iron quality by the Wuxi Dongfeng Metallurgical Plant in Jiangsu Province within a little over a month is a powerful proof.
    The value of this factory's experience lies not only in their ability to fundamentally reverse the situation of insufficient quality in a very short period of time, increasing the qualified rate of pig iron from 40% to 95.94%. More importantly, the first-class product rate of the pig iron they smelted has reached the level of 71.85%, proving that it is entirely possible for small blast furnaces to produce pig iron of the same quality as large blast furnaces.
    The situation of the Wuxi Dongfeng Metallurgical Plant is not an isolated case, and many such examples can be found in various regions. For example, the qualified rate of pig iron from the small blast furnace of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant in Hefei was only 40.2% in January this year, of which the first-class product rate accounted for only 7.84%; from July 1st to 20th, the qualified rate of pig iron had been increased to 97.8%, of which the first-class product rate reached 57.6%. Another example is the qualified rate of pig iron from the small blast furnace of the Shuizhi Iron Plant in Henan Province, which was 79.54% in April and had been increased to 95% in July, of which the first-class product rate had also reached more than 60%. In addition, the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace of the No. 1 Iron Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Anhui Province, the small blast furnace of Taipingli Iron Plant in Hunan Province, and the fourteen small blast furnaces in the Neijiang Special District of Sichuan Province, etc., have maintained an advanced level of 100% qualified rate of pig iron for a long time.
    Over the past year, the production practice of most small blast furnaces has fully proved that the insufficient quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces is not an inherent characteristic of the small blast furnaces themselves. As long as people exert sufficient effort and seriously strive to improve, it can be completely improved in a relatively short period of time. At present, the main reason why the quality of pig iron in some small blast furnaces is not good enough is the high sulfur content of the pig iron. There are various reasons for the high sulfur content of pig iron. Some are due to the high sulfur content of fuel and raw materials, which have not been processed as necessary; some are due to inappropriate slagging systems and large fluctuations in the heat of the hearth, which have not been able to fully exert the desulfurization ability of the furnace; and some are due to frequent furnace accidents and abnormal production. Many units have not yet established testing organizations and testing systems, and are not clear about the composition of raw materials and finished products. The most fundamental reason is that some enterprise leaders do not have a clear understanding of the relationship between quality and quantity, and have relaxed quality inspection work.
    How to grasp the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces? First of all, the leadership must clearly recognize the importance of improving quality, and be determined to improve the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces rapidly, make up their minds to firmly grasp quality, fully mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses to solve key quality problems. Secondly, effective measures must be taken. According to the experience of small blast furnace production across the country over the past year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has recently summarized twelve technical measures to ensure high-quality and high-yield small blast furnaces, which are being widely promoted in various regions. These twelve measures are: 1. Coking coal must be washed. 2. Iron ore must be selected. 3. Ore must be roasted, ore powder must be sintered, and limestone must be burned into quicklime as a flux. 4. Raw materials must be mixed evenly. 5. Reduce the particle size of raw materials. 6. Create alkaline slag and increase slag alkalinity. 7. Increase wind temperature. 8. Increase air volume. 9. Pig iron and raw materials must be tested. 10. Establish and improve technical management systems and economic accounting systems. 11. Implement a system of high quality and high price for pig iron and raw materials. 12. Reasonable location.
    The reason why Wuxi Dongfeng Metallurgical Plant and some other advanced units in other regions were able to fundamentally reverse the passive situation of poor pig iron quality in a very short period of time is that they strengthened leadership, unified thinking, mobilized the masses, and conscientiously implemented these twelve effective specific measures. And according to the current situation, they focused on grasping several key measures such as coal washing, ore, management, slagging system, and testing work. We believe that after the small blast furnaces across the country have effectively implemented these measures, the quality level of pig iron will definitely be rapidly improved, and the production of small blast furnaces will gradually approach the level of large blast furnaces in terms of quality, high yield, and low cost. Let us go all out, take effective measures in August and September, create excellent achievements in universally and rapidly improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, and welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day!

　　进一步提高小高炉生铁质量
　　本报评论员
    小高炉是1958年大跃进高潮中的产物。虽然时间还不到一年，它已经迅速地成长和壮大起来，形成了我国炼铁工业战线上一支强大的新生力量。目前，在生产方面，小高炉担负着与大中型高炉几乎同等的任务。没有这样一支力量，我国炼铁工业便不可能获得像今天这样高速度的发展。
    任何一种新生事物，在它成长的初期都不可能是很完善的。但是，只要积极地扶持它、帮助它，就可以使它迅速地进步。目前有些小高炉的生铁质量还不够好，也是小高炉成长过程中不可避免的事情。但是，只要我们积极地采取措施，就可以使小高炉的生铁质量迅速提高，以至和大高炉并驾齐驱。今天本报发表的江苏无锡东风冶炼厂在一个多月时间内迅速提高生铁质量的消息，就是一个有力的证明。
    这个厂的经验之可贵，不仅仅在于它们能够在很短的时间内根本扭转了质量不够好的局面，使生铁合格率由40％提高到95.94％。更重要的还表现在他们所炼的生铁的一级品率已经达到了71.85％的水平，证明小高炉完全有可能生产和大高炉同等质量的生铁。
    无锡东风冶炼厂的情况并不是个别的，各个地区都可以找到不少这样的范例。例如合肥中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂小高炉的生铁合格率，今年1月份只有40.2％，其中一级品率仅占7.84％；7月1日至20日生铁合格率就已提高到97.8％，其中一级品率达57.6％。又如，河南水冶铁厂小高炉的生铁合格率，4月份为79.54％，7月份已提高到95％，其中一级品率也已达到60％以上。还有，安徽马鞍山钢铁公司第一铁厂的红旗二号小高炉、湖南太平里铁厂的小高炉，以及四川内江专区的十四座小高炉等等，生铁合格率长时期以来一直都保持在百分之百的先进水平。
    一年来，多数小高炉的生产实践已充分证明了，小高炉生铁质量不够好，并不是小高炉本身固有的特性。只要人们鼓足干劲，认真地努力改进，在较短时期内是完全可以提高的。目前，一些小高炉生铁质量不够好，主要是生铁含硫量高。生铁含硫量高，有各种各样的原因。有的是燃料和原料含硫多，没有经过必需的加工处理；有的是造渣制度不适当、炉缸热度波动大，没有能充分发挥炉子的脱硫能力；有的是炉子事故多、生产不正常。还有不少单位没有建立起化验机构和化验制度，对原料和成品的成份都不清楚。而最根本的原因是有些企业领导对质量与产量的关系认识不明确，放松了质量检查工作。
    怎样来抓小高炉的生铁质量呢？首先，领导上要明确认识提高质量的重要性，要迅速提高小高炉生铁的质量，下定狠狠抓质量的决心，充分发动群众，依靠群众来解决质量上的关键问题。其次，要采取有效的措施。冶金工业部根据一年来全国各地小高炉生产的经验，最近总结出了十二项保证小高炉优质高产的技术措施，正在各地广泛推行。这十二项措施是：一、炼焦用煤要洗。二、铁矿石要选。三、矿石要焙烧，矿粉要烧结，石灰石要烧成生石灰作熔剂。四、原料要混匀。五、减小原料粒度。六、造碱性渣，提高炉渣碱度。七、提高风温。八、加大风量。九、生铁和原料要化验。十、建立和健全技术管理制度和经济核算制度。十一、生铁和原料实行优质优价的办法。十二、合理定点。
    无锡东风冶炼厂和其他地区的一些先进单位，所以能在很短时期内根本扭转生铁质量不好的被动局面，就在于它们加强了领导，统一了思想，发动了群众，认真地贯彻执行了这十二项行之有效的具体措施。并且根据当前情况，着重地抓了洗煤、矿石、管理、造渣制度、化验工作几项关键性措施。我们相信，全国各地小高炉在切实推行了这些措施以后，生铁质量水平一定能够迅速提高，小高炉生产一定能在优质、高产、低成本方面逐步接近大高炉的水平。让我们鼓足干劲，在8、9两月狠狠地采取有效措施，创造出普遍、迅速提高小高炉生铁质量的优异成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年！
