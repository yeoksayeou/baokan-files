　　Communist Party Member Jiang Xiumei in the Flood
　　By Our Correspondent Wu Yingshan
　　It was pouring rain at night. Laocaoyang Village, Ruhuo Commune, Boluo County, Guangdong Province, was entirely submerged in a vast expanse of floodwater, and houses were collapsing everywhere. In a house near the south of the village stood a blind old woman in her sixties, her lower body completely immersed in the water. She was anxious and at a loss. At this critical moment, a young female comrade rushed into her house: "Mother, let's go quickly! The flood is coming!" With that, she picked up the blind old woman and carried her through the deep water to the small hill north of the village.

　　She is Jiang Xiumei, the young female Communist Party member and deputy captain of Xinguang Brigade, Laocaoyang Village, Ruhuo Commune.

　　On the afternoon of June 13, the floodwaters came with particular force, and the levees of Ruhuo and Rengtu breached. The Party branch held an emergency meeting in Xincaoyang Village, resolving to assign cadres to take responsibility for different areas to protect the safe evacuation of the masses trapped by the water in each village. Jiang Xiumei's task was to go to the low-lying Laocaoyang Village. At that time, it was already late, and the water was rising higher and higher, with the surrounding villages like isolated islands, submerged in a vast expanse of white water. Jiang Xiumei couldn't swim and was a female comrade, so the branch considered this and asked an accountant to go with her. However, the accountant saw that it was raining heavily and the water was rising higher and higher, and said to Jiang Xiumei, "The water is so deep, I can't go! If you're not afraid, go yourself!" Jiang Xiumei was very angry when she heard this: "If you don't go, I will definitely go!" With that, she turned around and left like a gust of wind.

　　A female comrade who could not swim, braving the heavy rain, walked in a vast expanse of floodwater. It was late at night, and there was no companion around. The difficulties can be imagined. But Jiang Xiumei wasn't thinking about these things. What she was thinking about was the lives of all the villagers and the task entrusted to her by the Party. She was anxious and moved quickly, wading forward.

　　As she walked, she came to a small road. This road was very low-lying, and she was familiar with it; but now, everywhere was a vast expanse of water, and it was not clear where the pond was and where the road was. She couldn't swim, so what should she do? Suddenly, the heroic images of Liu Hulan and Xiang Xiuli flashed in her mind. She thought that they had heroically dedicated their lives for the Party and the people; but what about herself? After years of cultivation by the Party, she had become a Party member and a cadre from a primary school student, but compared to them, her work was far from enough. The selfless spirit of the martyrs illuminated Jiang Xiumei's heart. The road was flooded and could not be crossed, but she believed that as long as she was determined, there would always be a way. So, she found a wooden stick nearby, held onto the wooden stick, and floated over step by step. At this time, the sound of houses collapsing came from the village. How anxious this sound must have made her! She ran and shouted, "Run! The house is collapsing!" But this sound was drowned out by the thunder and rain, and no one heard it.

　　When she arrived in the village, she met several cadres. From the cadres, she learned that almost everyone in the village had been transferred to the high ground north of the village. But in order not to miss a single person, they were checking house by house. During the check, they found that there was still a blind old woman named Liu who had not left. Jiang Xiumei immediately mobilized the cadres to broadcast loudly on the hilltop, to find the target and rescue her; at the same time, she waded through water that was up to her waist, risking the danger of houses collapsing, and rushed to the blind old woman's house in one breath.

　　After rescuing the blind old woman, she, regardless of the day's fatigue, drove more than eighty pigs trapped in the pens to the mountain. She didn't sleep all night.

　　The next day, the water was even higher, and out of the one hundred and sixty houses in the village, one hundred and twenty-four were washed away. At this time, Party Branch Secretary Wang Banru also rushed here to check. After repeated checks on a house-by-house and person-by-person basis, it was found that there was also an old woman named Chen Jia and her paralyzed daughter who had not left. It turned out that old woman Chen loved her daughter very much and could not bear to leave her. Later, the floodwaters rose sharply and submerged her first floor, so she hid upstairs with the intention of dying with her daughter. So the branch secretary gave this task to Jiang Xiumei again. In addition, two young women, Jiang Jinxi and Su Jimai, were sent to go with her. At this time, the water was chest-deep, and it was necessary to walk sixty meters along the street, especially to pass through an alley more than ten meters long, to get to Chen Jia's house. The houses in the village were still collapsing, and the walls on both sides of the alley were shaking and about to fall down at any time. Jiang Xiumei didn't care about this much. "Even if the wall collapses, I have to go, even if my feet can't touch the ground, I have to go! Saving people is the most important thing!" A Communist Party member is willing to go through fire and water in order to complete the task assigned by the Party. Jiang Xiumei is such a fearless warrior. She quickly passed through the alley and came to the downstairs of Chen Jia's house.

　　The water was continuing to rise, and Jiang Xiumei was completely immersed in the water, with only her head showing. Her feet seemed unable to touch the ground, and she was shaking. At this time, Chen Jia was guarding her disabled daughter upstairs, helplessly making desperate plans. Suddenly, she heard Jiang Xiumei's anxious shouts downstairs: "Mother! We're here to save you! The house is about to collapse! Hurry up and leave!"

　　"How can we leave?"

　　"Use a bamboo basket to pass the patient down from the window!"

　　So, with a weight of one hundred and eighty pounds, including the person and the basket, pressing on Jiang Xiumei's shoulders, she loudly called out to Jiang Jinxi and Su Jimai, who were waiting outside the alley, and the three of them together carried the patient out. Old woman Chen Jia felt relieved to see her daughter rescued, and she herself crawled out of the window and left the danger zone with them. Three hours later, the building was washed away by the flood, and she said to Jiang Xiumei with emotion: "Chairman Mao's good cadre! If it weren't for you, we mother and daughter wouldn't even be able to find our bones!"

　　Jiang Xiumei's task was not yet finished. After she transferred Chen Jia and her daughter to the small mountain north of the village, the vast floodwaters surrounded the top of the mountain, and the water level was only five inches from the top of the mountain. More than three hundred people hiding on the small mountain were facing the threat of being submerged by the water again. How anxious Xiumei was! She made a small raft and decided to find the branch secretary to discuss the issue of rescuing people. She went to two villages and couldn't find him, but she found a boat. She was overjoyed and quickly brought the boat up the mountain to rescue the masses. At this time, Party Branch Secretary Wang Banru also arrived at the mountain with a wooden boat from another road. In this way, they promptly transferred all the three hundred people on the mountain to a safe area. Soon after people left the mountain, the flood submerged the small mountain again.

　　Jiang Xiumei, this selfless Communist Party member who is loyal to the Party, is only twenty-four years old this year. When she talked to us, she kept biting her handkerchief with her mouth. She seemed a little shy, but what a strong warrior she is! (Attached picture)

　　洪水中的共产党员江秀梅
　　本报记者　武迎山
    晚上，大雨倾盆。广东省博罗县汝湖公社老草杨村，整个浸在一片汪洋大水里，房屋到处崩塌着。靠村南的一间屋子里，站着一个六十多岁的盲婆，她的下身完全浸在水里。她心急如焚，莫知所措。就在这紧急关头，一个年青的女同志，冲进她的屋里：“阿娘，快走吧！大水来啦！”说着，就把盲婆背起，趟着深水，转移到村北的小山上。
    她就是汝湖公社老草杨村新光大队副队长、年青的女共产党员江秀梅。
    6月13日下午，洪水来得特别猛，汝湖、仍图两个堤围决口。党支部在新草杨村召开了紧急会议，决议并指定干部分片包干，保护各村被水围困的群众安全撤退。江秀梅的任务是到低洼的老草杨村去。当时，天色已晚，水越来越大，四面的村庄像一个个孤岛，淹在白茫茫的一片大水里。江秀梅不会游水，又是一个女同志，支部考虑到这一点就叫一位会计和她一块去。但是会计看到天下着大雨，水越来越大，就向江秀梅说：“水这么深，我可不去了！你要不怕，自己去吧！”江秀梅听了很生气：“你不去，我坚决去！”说着，一阵疾风似地转身就走了。
    一个不会游水的女同志，冒着大雨，走在一片汪洋的大水里，天色又晚，周围又没有一个伴儿；困难是可以想见的。可是江秀梅想的不是这些，她所想的是全村人的生命，党交给她的任务。她心急腿快，趟水前进。
    走着，走着，走到一条小路上。这条路很洼，是她平常所熟悉的；而现在，到处是一片汪洋，那里是塘，那里是路也不清楚。她又不会游水，怎么办呢？突然，刘胡兰、向秀丽的英雄形象，在她脑子里浮现了。她想，她们为了党和人民，英勇地贡献了自己的生命；可是，自己呢，几年来，经过党的培养，由一个小学生，入了党，当了干部，比起她们，工作还差得很远。先烈们的忘我精神，照亮了江秀梅的心。路是被淹了，不能过了，但她相信只要坚定，总是有办法的。于是，她在周围找到了一根木棍，手扳着木棍，一步一步地浮了过去。这时，村子里传来一片房倒屋塌的声音。这个声音该使她多么心急呀！她一边跑一边喊：“快跑呀！房子塌了呀！”但是这声音被雷声、雨声淹没了，没有人听见。
    赶到村里，碰到几个干部。从干部的口里，她知道全村的人差不多都已经转移到村北的高地。但是为了不漏掉一个人，他们又逐户排队。在排队中发现，还有一个瞎了眼睛的刘老太婆没有走。江秀梅立即发动干部在山头高地大声广播，发现目标，好去救人；同时自己趟着深及脐间的大水，冒着房屋倒塌的危险，一鼓劲冲到盲婆的家里。
    救出盲婆以后，她不顾一天的劳累，又把困在栏里的八十多头猪赶到山上。整整一夜没有睡觉。
    第二天，水更大了，全村房子一百六十多间，冲倒了一百二十四间。这时支部书记王伴如又赶到这里来检查。逐户逐人反复排队的结果，发现还有一位名叫陈佳的老太婆和她的一个瘫痪女儿没有走。原来陈老太婆爱女心切，不忍离开女儿。后来洪水猛涨，淹了她的第一层楼房，她就躲在楼上抱着和女儿同归于尽的打算。于是支书又把这个任务交给了江秀梅。另外又派了两个女青年——江金喜和苏冀妹，跟她一起去。这时水深齐胸，需要走六十米远的街道，特别是要穿过一条十多米长的小巷，才能到陈佳的家里。村里的房屋还在继续崩塌着，小巷两边的墙，摇摇欲坠，随时都有倒下来的危险。江秀梅那管得这许多，“墙倒了也要去，脚落不了地也要去！救人要紧哪！”一个共产党员为了完成党交给的任务，就是赴汤蹈火也心甘情愿。江秀梅就是这样一位无畏的战士，她飞快地穿过小巷，来到陈佳的楼下。
    水在继续上涨着，江秀梅整个浸在水里，只露着一个头，两脚好像踏不着地，摇摇晃晃的。这时陈佳正守着残废的女儿，在楼上莫知所措地作着绝望的打算。忽然，就听到江秀梅在楼下焦急的喊声：“阿娘！我们救你来啦！房子快塌啦！赶快走吧！”
    “怎么走呀！”
    “用竹箩把病人从窗口递下来！”
    于是，连人带箩一个百八十斤的重量压在江秀梅的肩上，这时，她大声呼喊原来等在小巷口外的江金喜和苏冀妹，三个人一起把病人抬了出去。陈佳老大娘看到女儿得救，如释重负，自己也就从窗口钻出，跟着一起离开了险境。三个钟头以后，楼房就被洪水冲塌了，她感动地对江秀梅说：毛主席的好干部啊！不是你，我们母女两个骨头都找不见啦！
    江秀梅的任务还没有完结，当她把陈佳母女转移到村北小山以后，汪洋大水围困着山顶，水位距离山顶只有五寸高。躲在小山上的三百多人，又面临着被水淹没的威胁了。秀梅是多么着急呀！她扎了一个小木排，决定去找支书研究救人的问题。走了两个村子都没找到，却找到一支船，她如获至宝，赶紧带船上山营救群众。这时，支部书记王伴如从另一条路也带来木船赶到山上。就这样，她们及时把山上的三百多人都转移到安全地带。人们离开山头不久，洪水又把小山淹没了。
    江秀梅——这位舍己为群、忠实于党的共产党员，今年才只二十四岁。她和我们谈话的时候，不断地用嘴咬着手帕，看样子，还有些羞答答的，可是她是多么坚强的一位战士啊！（附图片）
