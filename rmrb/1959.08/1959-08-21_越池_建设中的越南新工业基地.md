Viet Tri—A New Industrial Base Under Construction in Vietnam

During Vietnam's grand three-year plan (1958-1960), several new industrial zones will emerge in North Vietnam: Thai Nguyen, Viet Tri, Phu Tho, Dap Cau, Lao Cai, Nghe An, etc. Among them, Viet Tri is one of the most important industrial bases, second only to the Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel City.

Viet Tri is a beautiful city in the midlands of North Vietnam, more than seventy kilometers northwest of Hanoi. Standing on the Viet Tri iron bridge and looking into the distance, you can see rolling red hills in all directions, with rows of verdant kwai trees. Rice fields and sugarcane plantations are everywhere. The Thao River, the Lo River, and the Da River converge here along these hills, carrying turbulent waves.

During the war of resistance, the enemy occupied the urban area of Viet Tri as a springboard to control the downstream plains and attack northern Vietnam. At that time, the urban area was completely destroyed by the French invaders, with only a few small villages at the foot of the mountain, leaving behind some dilapidated thatched houses. The earth was shrouded in a cemetery-like atmosphere. During the day, there were no pedestrians on the road, and at night there was not a single light to be seen. Only solitary searchlights occasionally cut through the dark sky; in the suffocating silence, the sound of panicky machine guns would occasionally sound...

However, today it has completely changed. Entering the urban area, the first thing people feel is the city's vigorous vitality. As far as the eye can see, there are people everywhere. Everywhere are streams of people participating in the construction. They are carrying heavy loads of sand and stone towards the construction site. At the construction site, scaffolding is densely inserted into the sky. Bulldozers rumble back and forth, overturning piles of dirt. People wield hammers and shovels, raising tens of millions of strong arms to lay foundations and pour reinforced concrete. The heavy footsteps, the sound of tools colliding, and the roar of generators merge into a moving symphony, and the girls' bright and melodious singing is the most beautiful chorus of this movement:

\tWe are not afraid of getting tanned faces,
\tLet's carry a few more loads of soil!
\tQuickly flatten this mountain!...

The various projects under construction extend three kilometers along the Thao River. A pumping station is being built on the riverbank, which can supply 90,000 cubic meters of water to the entire industrial zone every day. A sugar factory capable of squeezing 7,000 tons of sugarcane annually is under construction. Next to the sugar factory are the construction sites of a paper mill, a chemical plant, a nylon factory, and a power plant. At the end of the construction site, a five-story rice mill has been completed. The locations of the various factories here are closely related to each other, like a huge and unified machine. Every day, the sugar factory squeezes tens of thousands of pounds of sugarcane, and the bagasse can be immediately transported to the paper mill to be made into pulp. The chemical plant will supply the paper mill with chemical raw materials such as soda, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid; it will also supply the nylon factory with hundreds of tons of celluloid powder and supply local farmers with thousands of tons of insecticides.

The power plant, which will be completed in September this year, will be equipped with the latest machinery. Its power generation capacity is larger than that of the Hanoi power plant. It will not only supply all the electricity for the Viet Tri industrial zone but also supply part of the electricity for Hanoi and the plains. In another year, all the factories will be put into production one after another.

### 越池——建设中的越南新工业基地

    越池——建设中的越南新工业基地
    在越南宏伟的三年计划（1958—1960年）期间，越南北方将出现好几个新的工业区：太原、越池、富寿、搭球、老街、义安等。其中，越池是仅次于太原钢铁城的重要工业基地之一。
    越池在河内西北七十多公里，是北越中游地区一个美丽的城市。站在越池铁桥上遥望，可以看到四面延绵起伏的红色丘陵，长着一行行青翠的葵树。稻田和蔗园比比皆是。滔江、底江和泸江沿着这些丘陵，带着翻腾的浪花在这里会合。
    抗战期间，敌人曾占据越池市区，作为控制下游平原和进攻越北的跳板。那时，市区遭到法国侵略者的彻底破坏，只山脚处有几座小村落，留下一些东倒西塌的茅舍。大地笼罩着坟场一般的气氛。白天，马路上没有来往行人，晚上看不见一点灯光，只有孤寂的探照灯，不时划破黑夜的天空；在令人窒息的寂静中，时而响起惶惶的机关枪声……。
    但是，今天这里已经完全变了样。进入市区，人们首先感到的是这个城市蓬勃的生命活力。一眼望去，到处是人。到处是参加建设的人流。他们挑着沉甸甸的沙石走向工地。工地里，脚手架密麻麻地插向高空。推土机隆隆地进进退退，掀翻一堆堆泥土。人们挥动着铁锤、铲子，扬起千万双结实的臂膀，去打地基，浇灌钢骨混凝土。沉重的脚步声、工具的碰击声和发电机的轰隆声，汇成一支动人的交响乐，而姑娘们嘹亮悦耳的歌声，是这个乐章的最美妙的合唱：
    我们不怕晒黑了脸，
    多把泥土挑几担哟！
    赶快削平这座山！……
    兴建中的各项工程，沿着滔江伸延三公里长。江边正在建筑一个抽水站，每天能供应整个工业区九万立方用水。一座每年能够压榨七千吨甘蔗的糖厂正在建成。糖厂的旁边，是纸厂、化工厂、尼龙厂和发电厂的工地。在工地末尾处，一座五层楼高的碾米厂已经建成。滔江彼岸，越池砖厂的烟囱在吐着浓烟。这里各个工厂位置的安排，相互间有着密切联系，像一个庞大统一的机体。每天，制糖厂榨成万斤甘蔗，蔗渣可以立即运到造纸厂制成纸浆。化工厂将供应造纸厂所需要的苏打、硫酸和盐酸等化学原料；还供给尼龙厂成百吨赛璐珞粉，供应当地农民几千吨杀虫药。
    今年9月完成的发电厂，将以最新的机器装备起来。它的发电量比河内发电厂还要大，不仅供应越池工业区的全部用电，还将供应河内和平原地区的一部分用电。再过一年，所有的工厂都将陆续投入生产。
