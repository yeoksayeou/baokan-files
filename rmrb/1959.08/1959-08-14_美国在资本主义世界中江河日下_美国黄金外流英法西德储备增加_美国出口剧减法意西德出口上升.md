　　America Declines in the Capitalist World
　　US Gold Outflow, Increased Reserves in Britain, France, and West Germany
　　Sharp Decline in US Exports, Rise in Exports from France, Italy, and West Germany
　　This newspaper reports that while American gold continues to flow out, the gold reserves of Britain, West Germany, and France are increasing.
　　According to a report by the US Federal Reserve, after an outflow of 2.3 billion US dollars in gold last year, another 837 million US dollars flowed out in the first half of this year. It is estimated that another 800 million to 1.2 billion US dollars will flow out in the second half of the year.
　　At the same time, the reserves of Britain, West Germany, and France have been steadily increasing. After rising for three consecutive months, Britain's gold reserves increased by another 48 million US dollars in July, a month that is traditionally unfavorable to the pound sterling. According to the British "Financial Times," this is largely due to the continued weakness of the US dollar. West Germany's gold reserves also increased by 23 million marks in July, increasing from 11.25 billion marks at the end of January to the current 11.305 billion marks.
　　France, which has long been plagued by trade and balance of payments deficits, also saw monthly improvements in its gold and foreign exchange reserves in the first half of this year, increasing from 1.4 billion US dollars in March to 1.66 billion US dollars in June, and further increasing to 1.773 billion US dollars in July.
　　John Harriman, an economist at the US Mutual Security Fund, pointed out on August 6 that the loss of American gold reflects the significant improvement in the economic situation abroad, particularly in Western Europe. He warned that the United States can no longer afford to lose its gold reserves at the same rate as in 1958, nor can it allow foreigners to accumulate US dollars indefinitely.
　　This newspaper reports that, according to the sixth annual report on world trade published by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on August 5, US production exports declined sharply last year, reducing its position in industrial production and trade in the capitalist world.
　　The report stated that the total value of trade in industrial goods in the capitalist world in 1958 decreased by 3% compared to the previous year, approximately 1.5 billion US dollars. Trade conditions developed very unevenly among the various capitalist industrial countries. US industrial exports fell sharply by about 1.1 billion US dollars in that year. Exports from West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden, however, all increased. Exports from Britain, Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada declined somewhat. Japan maintained the same level as the previous year. With the exception of the United States, the total value of industrial exports from these ten major industrial countries combined still increased by 340 million US dollars compared to 1957. This means that the decline in industrial exports in the capitalist world in 1958 was mainly due to the sharp decline in US exports.
　　The report stated that although the United States' position in the proportion of production and trade in the capitalist world is higher than in 1938 after the war, the proportion of US industrial production in the world has been declining since 1948. Prior to 1956, the rate of production development in most parts of the world was already faster than in the United States. In 1957 and 1958, when the level of US industrial production declined, production in other parts of the capitalist world was still rising, although the rate had slowed down.
　　The report specifically mentioned the threat posed by West German industrial exports to Britain. It stated that since 1953, West Germany's export growth rate has consistently exceeded that of Britain. Taking the Western European market as an example, from 1953 to 1957, the absolute increase in West German industrial exports to this region was five times that of Britain. West Germany's growth rate also exceeded Britain's in exports to the dollar area. Only in the sterling area can Britain maintain its advantage.

### 美国在资本主义世界中江河日下　美国黄金外流英法西德储备增加　美国出口剧减法意西德出口上升

　　美国在资本主义世界中江河日下
　　美国黄金外流英法西德储备增加
　　美国出口剧减法意西德出口上升
    本报讯　当美国黄金继续外流的时候，英国、西德、法国的黄金储备却在增加。
    据美国联邦储备局报告，美国继去年外流黄金二十三亿美元之后，今年上半年又外流黄金八亿三千七百万美元。下半年估计将再流出八亿到十二亿美元。
    与此同时，英国、西德、法国的储备则节节增加。英国的黄金储备继过去连续三个月的上升后，在7月这个一向对英镑储备不利的月份又增加了四千八百万美元的黄金储备。据英国“金融时报”称，这和美元的一直疲软有很大关系。西德的黄金储备7月份也增加了两千三百万马克，它的黄金储备已从1月底的一百一十二亿五千万马克增加到目前一百一十三亿零五百万马克。
    长期来一直为贸易和收支逆差所苦恼的法国，今年上半年黄金外汇储备也在逐月改善，从3月份的十四亿美元增加到6月份的十六亿六千万美元，7月份再增加到十七亿七千三百万美元。
    美国研究援外共同基金的经济学家约翰·哈里曼8月6日指出，美国黄金的流失反映了国外、特别是西欧经济情况的显著改进。他警告说，美国既不能再以1958年那样的速度损失掉存金，也不可让外国人无限制地积存美元。
    本报讯　根据“国际关税和贸易总协定”8月5日发表的关于世界贸易的第六次年度报告，去年美国生产出口剧减，在资本主义世界工业生产和贸易中的地位有了降低。
    报告说，1958年资本主义世界工业品的贸易总值比上一年下降了3％，约为十五亿美元。贸易情况在各个资本主义工业国家中发展得极不平衡。美国工业品出口在这一年猛降了约十一亿美元。而西德、法国、意大利、荷兰和瑞典的出口却都有增加。英国、比利时，瑞士和加拿大的出口有所下降。日本则仍然维持了前一年的水平。除美国以外，后面这十个重要工业国家总的工业品出口总值合计仍然比1957年增加了三亿四千万美元。这也就是说，1958年资本主义世界工业品出口的下降，主要是由于美国出口的剧减。
    报告说，尽管战后美国无论在资本主义世界的生产比重和贸易比重上其地位都超过1938年，但是1948年以后美国在世界工业生产中所占的比重却一直在下降。1956年以前世界大部分地区生产的发展速度本来就都快于美国。到1957年和1958年，当美国工业生产水平下降的时候，资本主义世界其他地区的生产却仍然在上升，尽管速度曾有所降低。
    报告特别提到西德工业品出口对英国带来的威胁。它说，从1953年以来，西德的出口增长速度一直超过英国。以西欧市场来说，从1953年到1957年西德对这一地区的工业品出口增长绝对数量就五倍于英国。在对美元区的出口方面，西德的增长速度也超过英国。只有在英镑区中，英国还能保持优势。
