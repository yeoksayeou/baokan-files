Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 13th: The Meeting of American Foreign Ministers continued its plenary session on the 13th. U.S. Secretary of State Herter revealed a ferocious countenance in a speech delivered at today's meeting. He presented a blatant program aimed at interfering in Cuba and opposing Latin American national democratic movements.

　　Herter linked the tense situation in the Caribbean, created single-handedly by the United States, with the "indirect aggression" of "international communism," saying that the tensions in the Caribbean region "gave international communists exactly the opportunity they have always sought." He threatened that the United States "cannot allow this virus to take root and spread on the American continent." It is clearly remembered that at the Tenth Pan-American Conference five years ago, Herter's predecessor, Dulles, issued the same anti-communist clamor as a signal for U.S. armed intervention in Guatemala.

　　Herter's intention was clearly exposed in his explanation of the two agenda items of the meeting. In this part of his speech, he directed his spearhead entirely at the national democratic struggles of Cuba and the people of the Caribbean region. When talking about the first agenda item – "Discussion of the situation in the Caribbean region" – Herter, disregarding the fact that the United States directly and indirectly crudely interfered in Cuba, instead insinuated Cuba, slandering it for violating the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and for being responsible for the tense situation in the Caribbean region. He exaggerated the so-called Cuban "expeditions" and "invasions" of other countries, saying that some people were attempting to "replace one form of tyranny with another." When talking about the second agenda item – "Effective implementation of representative democracy and respect for human rights" – Herter clamored "against all forms of dictatorship, whether right-wing or left-wing," while on the other hand, he tried his best to defend the dictatorial regimes in the Americas and slandered the people's struggle against dictatorship.

　　Although Herter tried his best to dress himself up as a "defender" of the "principle of non-interference," the actual propositions he put forward exposed his true colors. Herter emphasized the "collective security" of the so-called "Pan-American system," demanding that the meeting issue a declaration to "declare adherence to the basic principles of the Pan-American system" in order to strengthen U.S. control over Latin America. He also demanded the establishment of a "special temporary committee" to "study the situation in the Caribbean" and authorized the "Organization of American States" controlled by the United States to allow the "American States Peace Committee" to "consider" the "problems" in the Caribbean region. The United States actually wants to further interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries through these aggressive organizations. According to United Press International, the United States is in fact attempting to directly "investigate" the military facilities of relevant countries through these "committees" without even formal discussions within the "Organization of American States." Herter also demanded the establishment of a committee belonging to the "Organization of American States" to specifically supervise the implementation of "democracy." The committee would "have the right" to collect intelligence in various countries and would actually prescribe their political systems.

　　Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa then delivered a speech. He reiterated the solemn position against interference in Cuba's internal affairs and pointed out that the current tensions in the Americas are caused by dictatorial regimes and their supporters.

　　Roa said that the Cuban revolutionary government is a de facto democratic government, which directly represents the autonomous will of our people. It is not the product of elections, but the product of a revolution, a truly profound revolution carried out by the people. We will hold elections in the shortest possible period, but no one needs to set a date for us, because it is an internal affair of the Cuban state.

　　Roa went on to point out that if there are tensions in the Americas now, it is because there are still dictatorial regimes. These dictatorial regimes are not satisfied with long-term oppression of their own people and the exploitation of their wealth; they also conspire against their neighbors and commit all kinds of international crimes. Roa said that in the Americas, where natural resources are extremely rich, millions of people work all day long but have to go to bed hungry every day. Roa pointed out that the tensions are purely an external manifestation of deep economic roots. For this reason, Cuba has striven to make this foreign ministers' meeting discuss economic issues.

　　Roa condemned subversion from foreign countries. He said that Cuba firmly opposes any country or any group of countries interfering in the internal and foreign affairs of other countries. Gross violations of the principle of non-interference include radio broadcasts from Trujillo City and the recruitment of mercenary groups under the orders of Cuban enemies who are accurately called war criminals. The counter-revolutionary case recently cracked by Cuba, which was organized and funded in Trujillo City, is a conclusive proof of this situation. He went on to point out, however, that helping political exiles does not violate the principle of non-interference, and the sophistry that equates the principle of non-interference with the international protection of human rights only serves the interests of dictatorial regimes. Human rights are being trampled upon in some areas of the Caribbean and in other parts of the Americas.

　　Roa finally expressed his firm opposition to the opinion put forward at the meeting to establish some kind of supervisory committee. He said that this committee is a replica of the Organization of American States police force proposed by U.S. Senator Smathers, which violates the principle of non-interference, and therefore Cuba firmly opposes it.

　　Subsequently, the Foreign Minister of the Dominican dictatorial regime, Porfirio Herrera, slandered and threatened Cuba in his speech. The Cuban Foreign Minister gave a firm counterattack. A tense atmosphere immediately formed at the meeting.

### 美洲外长会议上摆开了阵势  赫脱露骨提出反对拉丁美洲民族民主运动纲领  古巴外长严词反对干涉内政痛斥外国颠复阴谋

    美洲外长会议上摆开了阵势
    赫脱露骨提出反对拉丁美洲民族民主运动纲领
    古巴外长严词反对干涉内政痛斥外国颠复阴谋
    新华社圣地亚哥13日电　美洲外长会议13日继续举行全体会议。美国国务卿赫脱在今天会议上发表的一篇演说中露出了狰狞的面貌。他提出了一套目的在于干涉古巴和反对拉丁美洲民族民主运动的露骨的纲领。
    赫脱把美国一手造成的加勒比海紧张局势同“国际共产主义”的“间接侵略”的鬼话联系在一起，说什么加勒比地区的紧张局势使“国际共产党人正好得到了他们一贯寻求的机会”。他威胁说，美国“不能听任这种病毒在美洲大陆上立足和蔓延”。人们记得很清楚，在五年前的第十届泛美会议上，赫脱的前任杜勒斯曾经发出同样的反共叫嚣，作为美国武装干涉危地马拉的信号。
    赫脱的用意在他对会议两项议程的阐述中暴露得很清楚。他在这一部分发言中把矛头完全指向古巴和加勒比地区人民的民族民主斗争。在谈到第一项议程——“讨论加勒比地区的局势”——时，赫脱不顾美国直接间接粗暴干涉古巴的事实，反而影射古巴，污蔑它破坏不干涉内政原则，应对加勒比地区紧张局势负责，他渲染所谓古巴
  “远征队”“入侵”其他国家的谰言，说什么有人企图“用一种形式的暴政代替另一种形式的暴政”。在谈到第二项议程——“代议制民主的有效实施和尊重人权”——时，赫脱叫嚷“反对一切形式的独裁，不管是右翼的还是左翼的独裁”，而另一方面却竭力为美洲的独裁政权辩护，诬蔑各国人民反独裁的斗争。
    赫脱虽然竭力把自己打扮成为
  “互不干涉原则”的“捍卫者”，但是他所提出的实际主张却揭穿了自己的真面目。赫脱强调所谓“泛美体系”的“集体安全”，要求会议发表一项宣言，“宣布信守泛美体系的基本原则”，以加强美国对拉丁美洲的控制。他还要求成立一个“特别临时委员会”来“研究加勒比的局势”，并授权美国一手控制的“美洲国家组织”所属“美洲国家和平委员会”来“考虑”加勒比地区的“问题”。美国实际上是要通过这些侵略性组织来进一步干涉加勒比各国内政。据合众国际社透露，美国事实上企图通过这些“委员会”甚至不通过“美洲国家组织”形式上的讨论，就直接“调查”有关国家的军事设施。赫脱还要求建立一个属于“美洲国家组织”的委员会来专门监督实施“民主”的问题，委员会将“有权”到各国搜集情报，并实际上规定它们的政治制度。
    古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚接着发表了演说。他重申反对干涉古巴内政的严正立场，并且指出，美洲现在的紧张局势是独裁政权及其支持者造成的。
    罗亚说，古巴革命政府是事实上的民主政府，它直接代表我国人民自主的意志。它不是选举的产物，而是革命、是人民进行的真正深刻的革命的产物。我们将在尽可能短的期间内进行选举，但是不需要任何人为我们指定日期，因为它是古巴国家的内部事务。
    罗亚接着指出，如果说美洲现在存在着紧张局势，那末这是由于现在还存在着独裁政权。这些独裁政权并不满足于长期压迫它们本国人民和搜刮民脂民膏，它们还阴谋反对他们的邻国并犯下了各种各样的国际罪行。罗亚说，在自然资源极其富饶的美洲，每天有千百万人劳动终日后却要饿着肚子睡觉。罗亚指出，紧张局势纯粹是深刻的经济根源的外部表现。由于这个原因，古巴才力争并使得这次外长会议讨论经济问题。
    罗亚谴责来自外国的颠复活动。他说，古巴坚决反对任何国家或任何国家集团干涉他国的内政和外交。粗暴地违反不干涉原则的是特鲁希略城的电台广播和在被确切地称作战犯的古巴敌人的命令下召募雇佣兵团。古巴最近破获的在特鲁希略城组织和得到资助的反革命案正是这种情况的确凿证明。他接着指出，然而，帮助政治流亡者并不违反不干涉原则，把不干涉原则同国际上的维护人权对立起来的诡辩只是为独裁政权的利益效劳。人权在加勒比海的某些地区和美洲其它一些地区正在遭受践踏。
    罗亚最后表示坚决反对会上有人提出的成立某种监督委员会的意见。他说，这种委员会是美国参议员斯马瑟斯所提出的成立美洲国家组织警察部队的翻版，这违反了不干涉原则，因此古巴坚决反对。
    接着，多米尼加独裁政权的外交部长波尔菲里奥·埃雷拉在发言中对古巴进行了污蔑和威胁。古巴外长予以坚决的反击。会上顿时形成了紧张的气氛。
