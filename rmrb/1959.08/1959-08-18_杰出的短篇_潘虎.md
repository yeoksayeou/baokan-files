Outstanding Short Story "Pan Hu"
　　Zheng Tong

　　Comrade Deng Hong's "Pan Hu" is a short story in the revolutionary memoir "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," which tells the story of a real person and a real revolution. The entire text is only five or six thousand words, but it vividly portrays a farmer hero with typical significance. After reading this work, Pan Hu's fiery, rude, and impetuous actions, as well as his docile, submissive, and innocent appearance in the face of truth, are vividly presented before your eyes, making you feel like you are seeing him in person and hearing his voice. It is indeed rare for the author to be able to create such a vivid and colorful personality type in such a short space. "Pan Hu" is an outstanding short story in terms of both ideological depth and artistic achievement.

　　The story depicted in the work takes place during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. A spontaneous peasant organization—Pan Hu and his guerrillas—recognized a party cadre in an accidental opportunity (Pan Hu and his guerrillas believed in divination, and the diviner said that two enemy spies would come from the town within three days. They caught two people, beat them up and interrogated them, only to find that one of them was an underground party worker—the work appears in the first person as "I"), and from then on, Pan Hu and his guerrillas came under the banner of the party and accepted the leadership of the party.

　　Pan Hu and his guerrillas were representative in China in the 1930s. Like many peasants with strong revolutionary demands, when the revolutionary wave was rising, they urgently demanded to join the Red Army, but for a time they could not find the Red Army, so they set up their own flags and started doing it themselves, calling themselves the Red Army guerrillas. But such guerrillas are, after all, spontaneous organizations of the peasant masses, and there is an essential difference between them and the real Red Army guerrillas led by the working class. The spontaneous power of peasants to resist the rulers has a strong blindness; while the Red Army guerrillas led by the working class consciously carry out the revolution under the guidance of communist ideology and have far-reaching ideals. The work reveals this essential difference through the characterization of Pan Hu and generally reflects the revolutionary situation at that time when a single spark could start a prairie fire—various revolutionary forces were leaning towards and converging with the party, forming a surging revolutionary upsurge.

　　The story begins with "I" being arrested, beaten, and interrogated by Pan Hu as an enemy spy, and ends with Pan Hu asking "I" to stay in the guerrillas as a political commissar. Although the story is not complicated, it progresses very quickly and always goes deeper unexpectedly, and each progress deepens the characterization of Pan Hu.

　　At the beginning, Pan Hu was so furious that he would rather believe in divination and not allow "I" to defend myself, and a bright and shining guillotine almost killed "I"'s head. But when "I" stood up and spoke frankly, accusing them of some behaviors that "are not revolution, but nonsense," and told them some revolutionary truths, telling them what the real Red Army guerrillas should be like, completely beyond people's expectations, the fiery man—Pan Hu, became so gentle and kind, and immediately asked "I" to lead him, and he was willing to obey unconditionally. "I" first declined and refused, but Pan Hu and his guerrillas expressed their sincerity in their own unique way: "'Then you are a spy!' Pan Hu pointed his finger at me and said sternly. The rest of the people also followed suit to force me." But when "I" agreed to stay, Pan Hu smiled triumphantly, so innocently! Here, the author only uses a few strokes to portray Pan Hu's noble qualities of pursuing truth, obeying truth, and being wholeheartedly loyal to the revolutionary cause, and his respectable and lovely image, in a simple and moving way.

　　The work particularly highlights the backward and naive behaviors of Pan Hu and his guerrillas in divination and working as long-term laborers. Here, the author is not writing about shortcomings for the sake of writing about shortcomings, but reflects a certain social essence through Pan Hu's specific and distinct personality. The description of these shortcomings not only does not detract from the brilliance of Pan Hu's image, but also shows the innocence and loveliness of the hero. In the description of Pan Hu's guerrillas torturing the long-term laborers who delivered rice, although the author did not specify that Pan Hu was present to command, it is shown from their later conversations that this behavior was exactly what Pan Hu thought was taken for granted. When his team members beat the long-term laborers mercilessly without saying a word, they said: "Who told you to work for the local tyrants?" "Who told you to push the cart for the local tyrants?" This kind of thinking and emotion is exactly Pan Hu's. They indiscriminately beat the long-term laborers, slashed the rice bags with machetes, and smashed the carts that pushed the rice, etc., indicating that their understanding is: the local tyrants are hateful, and everything that is related to the local tyrants should be smashed to pieces. This kind of reckless and naive action is precisely the most profound and essential reflection of the peasant masses' fierce and blind resistance to the feudal ruling class. This kind of resistance is only a spontaneous force, so the struggle they carry out is also blind to a large extent. Without the ideological guidance of the party and without the strong leadership of the working class, it would be difficult for them to find a way out, and they would end in failure like the countless peasant uprising armies in history. But because the times are different, the tragedy of history will no longer be repeated. They gained the leadership of the party and became part of the invincible armed forces of the working class. The author's description of these is precisely where the author's writing is meticulous and profound.

　　In Chinese classical literature, brilliant chapters have been written about the peasant uprising armies in history, and many immortal images of peasant heroes have become typical examples that we are familiar with. Pan Hu's roughness and straightforwardness naturally remind us of Li Kui and Lu Zhishen in "Water Margin"; Pan Hu's guerrillas remind us of the peasant uprising armies in Chinese history. They do have a lot in common, but their development and ending are fundamentally different. Pan Hu is not a personality copy of Li Kui and Lu Zhishen, but a continuation and development of the image of Li Kui and Lu Zhishen. Because the times are different, Pan Hu's ideological height and brilliant quality are far beyond those of Li Kui and Lu Zhishen. He grew from a peasant hero to a fighter of the working class, and his guerrillas also became part of the armed forces of the working class under the leadership of the party. This is their fundamental difference, and it is also the place where "Pan Hu" this work is particularly meaningful.

　　杰出的短篇“潘虎”
　　郑同
    邓洪同志的“潘虎”，是革命回忆录“星火燎原”一书中的一个短篇，写的是真实的人，真实的革命故事。全文只有五六千字，却写活了一个富有典型意义的农民英雄形象。读完这篇作品，潘虎那性如烈火、粗鲁、暴躁的举动，在真理面前，又那么驯顺、服贴、天真的模样，都活生生地呈现在眼前，使人如见其人，如闻其声。作者在短小的篇幅里，能塑造出这样一个有声有色的性格典型，的确是难能可贵的。“潘虎”无论在思想深度和艺术成就上，都够得上是一个杰出的短篇作品。
    作品描写的故事，发生在第二次国内革命战争时期。一个自发的农民组织——潘虎和他的游击队，在一个偶然的机遇里，认识了一个党的干部（潘虎和他的游击队迷信卜卦，卜卦人说三天之内有两个敌探从镇上来。他们捉来了两个人，加以吊打、审问，原来其中的一个，却是党的地下工作者——作品里是以第一人称“我”出现的），从此，潘虎和他的游击队归到党的旗帜下来，接受了党的领导。
    潘虎和他的游击队，在三十年代的中国，是有代表性的。他们像许多有强烈革命要求的农民一样，当革命浪涛正在高涨的时候，迫切要求参加红军，但一时又找不到红军，便自竖旗竿干起来，自称是红军游击队。但这样的游击队毕竟是农民群众的自发组织，和工人阶级领导的真正红军游击队有本质上的区别。农民反抗统治者的自发力量具有强烈的盲目性；而工人阶级领导的红军游击队是在共产主义思想指导下自觉地进行革命，具有远大的理想的。作品透过对潘虎的性格刻划，揭示了这种本质区别，并概括地反映了当时星火燎原的革命形势——各种革命力量向党靠拢、汇合，正在形成汹涌澎湃的革命高潮。
    作品从写“我”被潘虎当作敌探抓来吊打审问开始，到潘虎要求“我”留在游击队当政委为止，故事虽不复杂，但进展很迅速，而且总是出其不意地步步深入，每一进展都加深了对潘虎的性格刻划。
    起始，潘虎是那样暴跳如雷，他宁肯相信卜卦，不容“我”来申辩，一把雪亮的铡刀，几乎杀掉“我”的头。但当“我”挺身直言，指责他们一些行为“不是革命，是胡闹”，并对他们讲了一些革命道理，告诉他们真正的红军游击队应该是怎样的时候，完全出乎人的意料，那性如烈火的汉子——潘虎，竟变得那么温顺、婉和，立刻要求“我”来领导他，他愿意一切无条件服从。“我”先是推脱、拒绝，潘虎和他的游击队却用他们自己的独特方式表达了他们的诚意：“‘那你就就就是探子！’潘虎把手向我一指，厉声说。其余的人也跟着威逼我。”但当“我”答应留下时，潘虎得意地笑了，笑得那么天真！在这里，作者只用寥寥几笔，便把潘虎追求真理，服从真理，对革命事业赤胆忠心的高贵品质，可敬可爱的形象，朴实动人地勾勒了出来。
    作品里特别突出地描写了潘虎和他的游击队卜卦和打长工的落后、幼稚行为。在这里，作者并非为写缺点而写缺点，而是通过潘虎这个具体的鲜明个性，反映出了一定的社会本质。对这些缺点的描写，不但无损于潘虎的形象光辉，反而更显出英雄的天真可爱。在潘虎的游击队拷打送米长工的一段描写里，作者虽未点明有潘虎在场指挥，但从以后他们的谈话里表明，这种行为正是潘虎认为理所当然的事。他的队员不由分说狠打长工时说的：“谁叫你给土豪做长工？”“哪个叫你给土豪推车子？”这种思想情绪，也正是潘虎的。他们不问青红皂白，打长工、用马刀砍破装米的布袋，劈毁推米的车子，等等，说明他们的认识是：土豪可恨，凡是沾着土豪边的，都该打它个稀烂。这种蛮干、幼稚行动，正是最深刻、最本质地反映了农民群众对封建统治阶级激烈的、盲目的反抗情绪。这种反抗，只是一股自发力量，因此，他们进行的斗争，在很大程度上也是盲目的。如果没有党的思想指引，没有工人阶级的坚强领导，他们是很难打出一条出路的，他们会像历史上的无数农民起义军一样，以失败告终。但因时代不同了，历史的悲剧也不再重演。他们取得了党的领导，成为战无不胜的工人阶级武装的一部分。作品对这些加以描写，正是作者用笔细致、深刻的地方。
    在中国古典文学里，关于历史上的农民起义军，曾写下了辉煌的篇章，许多不朽的农民英雄形象，成为我们熟知的典型。潘虎的粗鲁、直爽，很自然地使我们想到“水浒”里的李逵、鲁智深；潘虎的游击队，使我们想到中国历史上的农民起义军。他们的确有极多的相似之处，但他们的发展和结局又根本不同。潘虎并非李逵、鲁智深的性格复制，而是李逵、鲁智深的形象的继续和发展。因为时代不同，潘虎的思想高度、品质光彩，都远远超出李逵、鲁智深之上。他由一个农民英雄，最后成长为工人阶级的战士，他的游击队也在党的领导下，成为工人阶级武装的一部分。这是他们的根本不同，也是“潘虎”这篇作品特别显得有意义的地方。
