　　Smashing the Large-Scale Offensive of the French Aggressor Troops
　　Major Victory for the Algerian Liberation Army

　　(Reported by this newspaper) According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station: The large-scale offensive launched by the French aggressor troops against the Algerian National Liberation Army in late July has been defeated.

　　This military operation by the French aggressor troops was personally commanded by Challe, the commander of the aggressor troops. Participating in this military operation were four elite French divisions, several paratrooper regiments, and naval commandoes, with a total force of more than 20,000 troops. Almost all of the French air force in Algeria also participated in this battle. France boasted that this was the "largest land, sea, and air offensive" in the four and a half years of the Algerian War.

　　The focus of the French offensive was the Kabylie Mountains in the Second Military Region of the Algerian National Liberation Army. According to French newspapers, the intention of the French military command was to first concentrate superior forces and equipment in this area to engage in a decisive battle with the main force of the Algerian army, and after "completely clearing this area," to then move on to neighboring areas for combat. However, with the support of the broad masses of the people, the Algerian National Liberation Army flexibly avoided the main force of the French army and launched widespread attacks on the French army's transport teams and isolated units. United Press International also revealed the plight of the French aggressor troops. It said that the Algerian National Liberation Army "has successfully used the method of dispersing its troops to deal with the French offensive each time. If the French army continues to disperse, they will be ambushed and attacked again." According to an announcement by the "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station, in just 10 days in early August, the French army had already lost thousands of soldiers and a large amount of equipment. The troops of the Second War Zone of the National Liberation Army penetrated deep into the rear of the French army, attacking French transport teams, warehouses, and supply stations, forcing the French army to withdraw a division of troops to defend the rear and communication lines. At present, the French army is in a state of being attacked from both the front and the rear, unable to continue the offensive. At the same time, the troops of other military regions of the National Liberation Army also seized the opportunity to launch widespread attacks, killing and wounding a large number of French troops, and expanding the Liberation Army.

　　The Paris weekly "French Observer," in a recent article analyzing this battle, had to admit that the failure of the French army was because the National Liberation Army was able to maneuver, while the actions of the French aggressor troops could not be kept secret, so that "all surprise elements disappeared" in the attacks. This publication lamented that the French army now "lacks hope of achieving victory more than ever."

### 粉碎法国侵略军大规模进攻　阿尔及利亚解放军大捷

　　粉碎法国侵略军大规模进攻
　　阿尔及利亚解放军大捷
    本报讯　据“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台广播：法国侵略军7月下旬对阿尔及利亚民族解放军发动的大规模进攻，已遭到了失败。
    法国侵略军这一次军事行动，是由侵略军司令夏耳亲自指挥的。参加这次军事行动的有四个法军精锐师，若干伞兵团和海军突击队，总兵力达二万多人。法国在阿尔及利亚的几乎全部空军也参加了这一战役。法国曾吹嘘说，这是阿尔及利亚战争四年半来“最大规模的陆海空攻势”。
    法军进攻的重点是阿尔及利亚民族解放军第二军区的卡比利山区。据法国报纸透露，法军指挥机关的意图是先在这一地区集中优势兵力和装备，和阿尔及利亚主力进行决战，在“完全扫清这一地区”之后，再转入到邻近地区作战。但是，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在广大人民支持下，灵活地避开了法军主力，对法军的运输队和孤立部队展开了广泛出击。合众国际社也透露了法国侵略军的窘境。它说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军“每次都成功地用分散军队的办法对付了法军的攻势。如果法军继续分散，他们又会遭到伏击和袭击。”据“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台宣布，仅在8月上旬10天内，法军已被消灭了上千的士兵，损失了大量装备。民族解放军第二战区部队深入法军后方，袭击法军运输队、仓库和兵站，迫使法军抽回一个师的兵力，保卫后方和交通线。目前法军已经处于前后受敌、无力继续进攻的状态。同时，民族解放军其他军区的部队也乘机广泛出击，大量杀伤法军，并且扩大了解放军。
    巴黎“法兰西观察家”周刊，最近在一篇分析这次战役的文章中，不得不承认法军的失败是因为民族解放军能够机动作战，而法国侵略军的行动却不能保持秘密，以致出击的“一切突然因素都消失了”。这家刊物哀鸣，法军现在“比任何时候都更缺少取得胜利的希望”。
