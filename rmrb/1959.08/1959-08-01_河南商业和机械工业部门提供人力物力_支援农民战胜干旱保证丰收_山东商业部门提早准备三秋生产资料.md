Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st - Commercial departments and mechanical industry departments in Henan Province are supporting farmers with massive manpower and materials to combat drought and protect seedlings.

According to incomplete statistics, commercial departments in various regions have supplied 7,557 waterwheels, 1,029 power machines, and 126 water pumps to severely drought-stricken areas; they have also allocated a large number of diesel fuel, lubricating oil, and coal.

According to incomplete statistics from Kaifeng and Xinxiang prefectures alone, the mechanical industry departments have rushed to produce 2,802 waterwheels and more than 100,000 parts since the start of the drought resistance effort.

Commercial and mechanical industry departments throughout the province have concentrated a large amount of manpower to repair damaged drought-fighting tools or those lacking parts. Mechanical factories at the county level and below have repaired more than 290,000 pieces of various water lifting tools. Commercial departments in Kaifeng, Xuchang, Xinxiang, and Xinyang prefectures have transferred more than 12,000 technicians to the countryside to repair and install more than 17,000 waterwheels and more than 10,000 other water lifting tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 31st - Commercial departments in Shandong are starting early to prepare agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pesticides needed for the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting.

The Shandong Provincial Department of Commerce made specific arrangements for the supply of materials for the "Three Autumns" production at a meeting of commercial bureau chiefs from various prefectures and counties held in early June. Linyi Prefecture needs to add a large number of agricultural tools such as plows, harrows, hoes, iron shovels, and board hoes. In addition to actively promoting the existing inventory of 780,000 pieces, commercial departments have signed production and sales contracts with industrial departments for 270,000 pieces. Commercial departments are transporting prepared autumn planting fertilizers and pesticides to rural areas, while also adopting the method of using local materials and local production to produce large amounts of native fertilizer and native pesticides.
