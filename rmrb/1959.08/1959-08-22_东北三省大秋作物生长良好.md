Northeast China's Three Provinces Enjoy Good Growth of Autumn Crops
Liaoning: Strive to Increase Production by Another 10% on the Existing Basis
Heilongjiang: Vigorously Promote Early Maturity, Prevent Frost and Flooding, and Ensure a Bumper Harvest
Jilin: Launch a High Tide of Competition to Exceed Contracted Production and Seize a Bumper Harvest

(Our Newspaper, Shenyang, August 21st) Liaoning Province's more than 70 million mu of major autumn crops are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The broad masses of farmers throughout the province are further strengthening the late-stage management of autumn fields, striving to increase the production of major autumn crops by another 10% on the existing basis.

At present, a scene of impending bumper harvest is emerging in the rural areas of Liaoning. Sorghum and corn, which account for more than one-third of the sown area, have uniform and large ears, tall stalks and thick cobs, and are in the process of ripening; millet, which is particularly pleasing, has full grains; cotton has many fruit branches, large buds, early flowering, and little boll shedding. Other various coarse grain crops are also lush and green.

This year, the people's communes in various parts of Liaoning Province have fully demonstrated their tremendous superiority, persistently overcoming the continuous drought, flood, and insect disasters, and achieving great results in fighting disasters and ensuring harvests.

In May and June, drought occurred in some areas of Liaoning Province, threatening the growth of early seedlings and the sowing of late fields. At that time, the people's communes immediately concentrated their efforts to combat the drought. During the tense period of drought resistance, more than one million drought-fighting troops were mobilized throughout the province every day, making every effort to tap various water sources. According to incomplete statistics, the various crops planted and replanted reached more than 15 million mu. In mid- and late June, as soon as the drought was relieved, floods and waterlogging disasters occurred successively in some areas, affecting an area of more than 2.15 million mu. After vigorously draining water to save seedlings, more than 1.4 million mu of crops have been freed from waterlogging disasters, and the seedlings are growing normally. This year, insect pests in the province are also more serious. According to statistics from sixteen counties, the affected area reached more than 1.5 million mu. During the peak period of insect pests, more than 300,000 people participated in insect prevention and extermination every day, curbing the spread of insect pests and protecting the growth of crops.

People's communes have shown great power in the fight against natural disasters. In the drought resistance struggle, the people's communes in Zhuanghe County concentrated their superior forces to dig canals to divert water for irrigation, and adopted various methods such as carrying by hand, using basins, and installing water tanks in the fields, promptly resisting drought and sowing seeds, and irrigating more than 50,000 mu of fields. The people's communes in Tieling County implemented large-scale drought resistance cooperation. Based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, each commune transferred 9,000 laborers, fought fiercely for forty days, helped the severely water-deficient Suntaizi and Dafanhe communes, drilled 429 deep wells, and enabled more than 15,000 mu of paddy fields to be transplanted in time. In Chaoyang County, when cotton suffered from insect pests in 1957, due to insufficient labor and untimely and incomplete prevention and control, each mu only yielded more than 110 jin of seed cotton, a decrease of more than 50% compared with normal years. This year, cotton insect pests in this county are even more serious than in 1957, but because the people's communes timely coordinated and arranged labor, mobilizing more than 50,000 people every day, they wiped out red spiders and cotton aphids in more than 150,000 mu of cotton fields in three days, ensuring the vigorous growth of cotton seedlings.

At present, the province's farmers are launching a vigorous production upsurge in the "hanging up the hoe" season, further strengthening the late-stage management of autumn fields. Many areas have responded to the provincial party committee's call to "increase production by another 10% on the existing basis," adding autumn field management measures, launching competitions, and launching a large-scale "10,000 mu of 1,000 jin fields movement." In just a few days, eleven counties including Xinjin, Tieling, and Chaoyang eliminated more than 1.3 million mu of weed-infested areas. In the previous stage, only more than 6,000 people in Xifeng County were engaged in autumn field management work every day, but now it has increased to more than 12,000 people, removing more than 6,000 mu of large weeds, draining water to save seedlings in 10,000 mu of low-lying areas, and also starting to loosen the soil around sorghum in autumn and top the tips and remove leaves from soybeans.

(Our Newspaper, Harbin, August 21st) Since the beginning of summer, the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, the first year after the realization of communization, have enjoyed favorable weather, and the major autumn crops such as soybeans, sorghum, millet, and corn in most areas are growing very well. Everywhere is a scene of bumper harvest in sight. At present, the province's farmers are strengthening the late-stage field management in one go, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

After overcoming the continuous drought of half a year last winter and this spring, Heilongjiang Province's more than 13 million mu of spring wheat have already achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, while the major autumn crops, which are more than eight times that of wheat, are currently growing luxuriantly and densely, a large expanse of green covering the land. The 21.44 million mu of soybeans in the province, the soybean seedlings covering the ridges, are like a layer of green brocade covering the black land, with many branches, fat leaves, and abundant pods. At present, most of the soybean fields in the province have completed three cultivations and three weedings, and two to three applications of fertilizer are being rushed to loosen the soil, weed, and pinch the tips to promote more pod formation. The lush millet has also grown to chest height, and the heavy ears of millet have begun to droop. The sorghum in various places is also growing exceptionally well, with large ears and thick stems, reaching seven feet high. It is very common for one corn stalk to produce two cobs this year.

What the reporter saw on the thousand-mile plains from the Heilongjiang River to the Hulan River was: among all the good crops, those that grew particularly well were most of the plots that had been carefully and meticulously plowed after communization last year. This shows that the widespread good growth of major autumn crops in the province this year is the result of fully demonstrating the superiority of the commune. This year, most crops in various places are planted on autumn-plowed land with a plowing depth of six to eight inches, or even deeper. Half of the crops are sown with mechanical and new-style animal-powered farm tools, and most crops are planted 20% denser than last year, gradually approaching the requirements of rational close planting. At the same time, manure fertilizer was also widely applied.

This year, most areas of the province have basically had favorable weather, and sufficient sunshine has guaranteed the needs of crop growth. However, some areas have also suffered from natural disasters such as drought, frost, wind, and insects to varying degrees. Last autumn and winter, rainfall and snowfall were much less than in normal years, and there was a great possibility of spring drought. Therefore, before spring plowing and sowing this year, the people's communes in various places carried out meticulous land preparation work on the basis of autumn-plowed land last year, especially cleaning up all kinds of crop residues in the cultivated land, which not only strengthened the moisture retention capacity, but also played a role in preventing and controlling insect pests. When sowing, the number of soil compaction for crops was also generally increased, which also played a great role in preventing spring drought this year. Even so, varying degrees of drought still occurred in some areas during the sowing and seedling growth period. For example, the rainfall in Gannan County for ten months was only 93.5 centimeters. However, the commune gave full play to the superiority of having a large population and mobilized more than one million laborers in a unified manner, built more than 300 million cubic meters of earthwork water conservancy projects, coupled with the soaring enthusiasm of the farmers, and finally overcame the threat of spring drought. Farmers in the counties of Nehe and Zhaodong, which were severely affected by drought, drew water or diverted water from newly built reservoirs that had already stored water for irrigation; tens of thousands of farmers in various places carried water and pulled water to irrigate fields, reducing severe droughts and turning small droughts into nothing.

At present, the broad masses of farmers in Heilongjiang Province are confidently and energetically striving for a greater harvest this year. More than one million men and women farmers are pulling out large weeds and loosening the soil in autumn in the fields to promote early maturity of crops and avoid early frost damage, and more than 100,000 men and women farmers are nervously digging canals to prevent floods and waterlogging to ensure a bumper harvest this year.

(Our Newspaper, Changchun, August 21st) Following the bumper harvest of spring wheat, autumn crops in Jilin Province are currently growing particularly luxuriantly. Corn has grown more than one person tall, most of it has tasseled and silked, millet and sorghum have all headed, soybeans are flowering and podding, and everywhere is a scene of bumper harvest in sight.

Since this spring, a continuous production increase competition has been carried out on the agricultural front in Jilin Province. Starting from the initial spring plowing preparation, 42 counties, 468 people's communes, 5,400 management areas, and more than 33,000 production teams (accounting for 96% of the total), and more than 3.5 million commune members (accounting for more than 90% of the total rural labor force) have invested in the fiery competition movement.

This year, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience of past agricultural production increase competitions. At the beginning, it directly grasped seven counties, including Yushu, Yongji, and Jiaohe, which represent different regions (mountainous, semi-mountainous, plain, grassland, etc.) of the province, and jointly proposed a competition initiative to all cities and counties in the province. Then, according to the agricultural season, it proposed the competition content for each period; when the two seasons alternated, the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Production Increase Competition Evaluation Committee went to the seven counties for inspection and evaluation, and each county also sent people to participate; the results of the inspection and the problems found were promptly published in newspapers and broadcast. In this way, the Provincial Party Committee timely grasped the overall situation, and at the same time established models, inserted red flags, and promoted the overall situation throughout the province. For example, at the end of spring plowing and the beginning of summer hoeing, the seven counties' spring plowing competition evaluation and summer hoeing on-site meeting was held in Yongji County. At the meeting, it was learned that the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows of crops was relatively serious in various places. Therefore, the experience of Yongji County in checking seedlings and replanting was summarized on the spot, and a movement to check seedlings and replant was launched throughout the province, so that more than 500,000 hectares of seedling-deficient land basically achieved full seedlings after a concentrated replanting and seedling transplanting. Later, the province organized three joint inspections and evaluations and convened four on-site meetings, timely summarizing the experience of large-scale manure fertilizer, land preparation, summer hoeing, and tool reform. The local party committees and county party committees also organized two to three large-scale inspections and evaluations; the main cadres of the county party committees and commune party committees generally adopted the form of contracting leadership in separate areas to lead the competition movement, so that the movement deepened step by step.

This year, the form of the agricultural production increase competition is also diversified. In addition to carrying out competitions between counties and communes within the province, competitions between management areas, production teams, and between the same types of work and departments were also widely carried out in various places. Most communes also carried out some other forms of competition. Among young people, more than 10,000 youth high-yield teams were organized for competition. Among women, more than 1.89 million people participated in the "Red Banner Hand" competition for women. In this way, the competition was gradually promoted into a national movement. This year, 139,000 cadres at all levels in the province participated in the competition, further encouraging the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the commune members.

The competition movement on the agricultural front in the province has brought great changes to this year's agricultural production. Taking autumn cultivation as an example, in previous years, it was generally one cultivation and two weedings or two cultivations and three weedings, and the amount of fertilizer applied was very small; this year, 500,000 hectares of land in the province have been cultivated four times, 620,000 hectares of land have been weeded four times, and fertilizer has been applied to 1.3 million hectares of land. Rice is being weeded and fertilized.

Since July, the party committees at all levels in the province have timely criticized the complacent and slack mood that began to grow, and formed a 10,000-person agricultural inspection group to go deep into the fields, encourage hard work, and add measures. A competition upsurge centered on agricultural "exceeding contracted production" and striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest has been launched throughout the province.

    东北三省大秋作物生长良好
    辽宁　争取在现有基础上再增产一成
    黑龙江　力催庄稼早熟防霜防涝保丰收
    吉林　掀起超包产夺丰收的竞赛高潮
    本报沈阳21日电　辽宁省七千多万亩大秋作物，普遍生长良好，丰收在望。全省广大农民正在进一步加强秋田后期管理，力争大秋作物在现有的基础上再增产一成。
    目前，辽宁农村中呈现一片丰收在望的景象。占播种面积三分之一以上的高粱、玉米，穗齐穗大，秸高棒粗，正在晒米度粒；特别令人喜爱的谷子，籽粒饱满；棉花，果枝多，棉蕾大，开花早，脱铃少。其他各种杂粮作物，也是一片翠绿。
    今年，辽宁省各地人民公社充分发挥了巨大的优越性，坚持不懈地战胜了连续发生的旱、涝、虫灾，取得了抗灾保收的巨大战果。
    5、6月间，辽宁省部分地区发生干旱现象，威胁着早期幼苗的生长和晚田的播种工作。当时，人民公社立即集中力量同干旱灾害搏斗。在抗旱紧张时期，全省每天出动一百多万抗旱大军，千方百计挖掘各种水源。据不完全统计，抢种和补种的各种作物达一千五百多万亩。6月中、下旬，旱象刚刚解除，部分地区又相继发生了洪水内涝灾害，受灾面积达二百一十五万多亩。经过大力排水救苗，已有一百四十多万亩作物摆脱了内涝灾害，禾苗正常生长。今年，全省虫灾也较严重。据十六个县统计，受灾面积达一百五十多万亩。在虫灾盛期，每天参加防虫灭虫的有三十多万人，制止了虫灾蔓延，保护了作物的生长。
    人民公社在同自然灾害作斗争中大显威风。庄河县各人民公社在抗旱斗争中，集中优势兵力挖渠引水灌溉，并采取人挑、盆端和在地里安水缸等多种多样的办法，及时抗旱播种，浇水灌田五万多亩。铁岭县各人民公社实行抗旱大协作，各公社本着互助互利的原则，抽调了九千名劳动力，激战四十天，帮助严重缺水的孙台子、大泛河两个公社，打了四百二十九眼深井，使一万五千多亩水稻田都及时插上了秧。朝阳县在1957年棉花发生虫灾时，由于劳力不足，防治不及时，不彻底，每亩只收一百一十多斤籽棉，比常年减产五成以上。今年，这个县棉花虫灾比1957年还严重，但是由于各人民公社及时统筹安排了劳力，每天出动五万多人，三天时间就扑灭了十五万多亩棉田里的红蜘蛛、棉蚜虫，保证了棉苗旺盛生长。
    目前，全省农民正在“挂锄”季节掀起热火朝天的生产高潮，进一步加强秋田后期管理。许多地区响应省委提出的“在现有基础上再增产一成”的号召，追加了秋田管理措施，展开了评比竞赛和大搞“万亩千斤田运动”。新金、铁岭、朝阳等十一个县，几天之内就消灭了一百三十多万亩草荒现象。西丰县前一阶段每天只有六千多人进行秋田管理工作，现在已经增加到了一万二千多人，拔除大草六千多亩，洼地排水救苗一万亩，高粱放秋垅、大豆摘心打叶也开始了。
    本报哈尔滨21日电　入夏以来，实现公社化后第一年的黑龙江省广大农村风调雨顺，绝大部分地区的大豆、高粱、谷子，苞米等各项大秋作物都生长很好，到处是一片丰收在望的景象。目前，全省农民正一鼓作气地加强后期田间管理，争取全面丰收。
    经过去冬今春战胜了连续半年的干旱之后，黑龙江省今年一千三百多万亩春小麦，已经获得空前丰收，而比小麦多八倍以上的大秋作物，目前正一望无际地、一大片一大片地生长得碧绿密茂。全省二千一百四十四万亩大豆，封垅的豆秧，好像一层齐腰深的绿色锦被复盖着黑色的大地，分杈多、叶子肥、结荚累累。目前，全省大豆田大部分都已完成三铲三趟，追肥两遍到三遍，正抓紧松土、锄草、掐尖，促使多结豆荚。繁茂的谷子也已经长到齐胸高，沉重的谷穗开始低垂。各地的高粱也生长的分外好，穗大茎粗，高达七尺，一株苞米禾结两个棒，今年是很平常的现象。
    记者在黑龙江边到呼兰河畔的千里平原上所看到的情况是：所有的好庄稼中，长得格外出色的，是那些去年公社化后已经认真细致翻耕过的大部分地块。这就说明，今年全省大秋作物普遍生长很好，正是充分发挥公社优越性的结果。今年各地大部分作物种在耕深达六到八寸，甚至更深一点的秋翻地上。有半数的作物是用机械农具和新式、畜力农具播种的，大部分作物比去年密植20％上下，逐步接近合理密植的要求。同时，还普遍的增施了粪肥。
    今年全省大部分地区虽然基本上风调雨顺，日照时间也充足，保证了禾苗生育的需要。但也有部分地区遭受程度不同的旱、冻、风、虫等自然灾害。去年秋冬两季，雨雪均较常年少很多，大有春旱的可能。因此，今年春耕播种前，各地人民公社就在去年秋翻地的基础上，进行了细致的整地工作，特别是把耕地里的各种作物渣子都清理了出去，这就不仅加强了保墒能力，还起到了防虫灭虫的作用。在播种时，又较普遍地增加了农作物的镇压次数，对防止今年春旱也起了很大的作用。虽然如此，在播种和禾苗生育期间，部分地区仍然曾经发生不同程度的干旱，例如甘南县前后十个月的降水量只有九十三点五厘米。但是，公社发挥了人多力量大的优越性，由公社统一调动上百万劳动力，兴修了三亿多土方的水利工程，加上农民的冲天干劲，终于战胜春旱威胁。旱象严重的讷河、肇东等县的农民，从新修的并且已经蓄了水的水库里，提水或引水进行灌溉；各地都有数以万计的农民挑水、拉水灌田，使大旱减轻、小旱化无。
    目前，黑龙江省广大农民，正信心百倍、干劲冲天地争取今年更大的丰收，有一百多万男女农民，正在农田里拔大草和放秋垅，以促使庄稼旱熟，避免早霜危害，还有十多万男女农民，正紧张开渠，防洪防涝，以保证今年大丰收。
    本报长春21日电　吉林省继春小麦赢得大丰收之后，目前，秋田作物生长特别茂盛。苞米已长有一人多高，大部分出蓼吐缨，谷子和高粱都已抽穗，大豆正在开花结荚，到处一片丰收在望的景象。
    吉林省农业战线上，从今春以来持续开展了增产竞赛运动。从初春备耕开始，全省已有四十二个县，四百六十八个人民公社，五千四百多个管理区，三万三千多个生产队（占总数的96％），三百五十多万社员（占农村劳动力总数90％以上）投入了火热的竞赛运动。
    今年，中共吉林省委总结了过去农业增产竞赛的经验，一开始直接抓住代表全省不同地区（山区、半山区、平原、草原等）的榆树、永吉、蛟河等七个县，联合向全省各市县提出竞赛倡议。接着又按农事季节提出各时期的竞赛内容；在两个季节交替的时候，由吉林省农业增产竞赛评比委员会到七个县进行检查评比，各县也都派人参加；检查的结果和发现的问题，及时登报和广播。这样，省委就及时掌握了全面情况，同时在全省树立了样子，插了红旗，推动了全面。例如在春耕结尾夏锄开始时，在永吉县召开了七个县的春耕竞赛评比和夏锄现场会议，会上了解到各地庄稼缺苗断条现象比较严重，于是就地总结了永吉县查苗补种的经验，在全省掀起查苗补种运动，使全省五十多万公顷缺苗地经过突击补种和移苗，基本上达到了全苗。以后，全省又组织了三次联合检查评比，召开了四次现场会议，及时总结了大搞粪肥、整地、夏锄和工具改革等经验。各地委县委也都组织了二至三次的大检查大评比；县委和公社党委主要干部，普遍采取了分片包干形式领导竞赛运动，使运动步步深入。
    今年农业增产竞赛形式也是多样化的。除在全省范围内开展县与县、公社与公社的竞赛外，各地还普遍开展了管理区之间、生产队之间和同工种同部门之间的竞赛。大多数公社还开展了一些其他形式的竞赛。在青年中，组织了一万多个青年高产队竞赛。在妇女中，有一百八十九万多人参加了妇女“红旗手”竞赛。这样，就把竞赛逐渐推广成全民的运动。全省今年有十三万九千名各级干部参加了竞赛，进一步鼓舞了社员的政治热情和劳动积极性。
    全省农业战线上的竞赛运动，给今年的农业生产带来很大的变化。以秋田铲趟为例，往年一般是一铲二趟或二铲三趟，追肥的数量很少；今年全省已有五十万公顷地做到四铲，六十二万公顷地做到四趟，追肥土地已达一百三十万公顷，水稻正在除草和追肥。
    7月以来，全省各级党委及时批判了开始滋长的自满松劲情绪，并组成农业万人检查团，深入田间，鼓干劲，加措施。一个以农业“超包产”为中心、力争全面大丰收的竞赛高潮，已在全省范围内开展起来。
