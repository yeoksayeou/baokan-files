Daring to think, speak, and act is the lofty style needed in our great era of leaping development.

In last year's Great Leap Forward and in this year's continued Great Leap Forward, the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act has blossomed everywhere, playing a great role recognized by the people. Many people who dare to think, speak, and act, who dare to innovate and create, and who dare to establish advanced banners have been praised, respected, and emulated for their heroic and creative labor. Historically, many revolutionaries and scientists dedicated themselves to the people's revolutionary cause, to scientific research, and to creative inventions. Their revolutionary courage, their fearless pursuit of truth, their far-sightedness, bold creation, and tireless efforts to promote historical progress and scientific development have always been regarded as examples of daring to think, speak, and act. In the period of socialist construction, daring to think, speak, and act, breaking the shackles of outdated traditions, and inspiring the wisdom and talent hidden in the people embodies the spirit of the general line of socialist construction and meets the requirements for high-speed development of socialist undertakings. Our socialist construction is a great and arduous cause. We must not only change the face of society but also change the face of nature and the spiritual outlook of the people. In such a great and arduous historical undertaking, it is obviously impossible to do without the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. We have always believed that the combination of revolutionary courage and a pragmatic spirit of daring to think, speak, and act is a noble quality of revolutionaries.

Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, the flowers of daring to think, speak, and act are blooming everywhere in Jiangsu Province, as in other parts of the country. For example, hydraulic coal mining was once described by some as a very mysterious cutting-edge technology, but during last year's Great Leap Forward, workers and technicians at the Qingshanquan Coal Mine set the ambitious goal of "building a hydraulic coal mining face using indigenous methods without state investment." Under the leadership of the mine's Party committee, they overcame numerous technical difficulties and, with two red furnaces, worked hard for seven days to create the first water gun. Then, after more than a month, they used old equipment to modify and refit other equipment for hydraulic coal mining. In this way, they spent a total of 1,000 yuan to establish the first hydraulic coal mining face in Jiangsu Province. Last year, the people of Suining County broke the superstition that reservoirs could only be built in mountainous areas and built reservoirs on the plains. Suining County has more than 1.8 million mu of land, which consists of Yellow River alluvial soil, of which 480,000 mu are sandy soil. It has been prone to flooding and drought for many years. After liberation, although great efforts were made to build water conservancy projects, the flood disaster was basically eliminated, but the threat of drought remained great. The county Party committee once mobilized people to dig wells and build ponds to store water, but this still could not solve all the drought resistance problems. Some people said: "Suining is a hopeless place and drought disaster cannot be solved." However, the county Party committee used facts to break this superstition. In the upsurge of water conservancy construction in the winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958, it was decided to use the levee of the abandoned Yellow River to build reservoirs. Seven or eight large and small reservoirs, including Hanba, and the Guang'an Reservoir were built successively. The Guang'an Reservoir alone, after completion, can solve the irrigation of 500,000 mu of dry land and 200,000 mu of paddy fields, and can also protect 180,000 mu of land along the abandoned Yellow River from flooding every year. In last year's drought resistance struggle, the masses of Jiangning County once used more than 200 waterwheels to cross mountains more than 150 meters high and introduced water from the Yangtze River, 60 li away, into the drought-stricken areas, resulting in increased production. There are many such moving examples, which cannot be listed one by one in an article. From the few examples already cited, it can be seen how important daring to think, speak, and act is for the Great Leap Forward and for developing socialist construction undertakings in a more, faster, better, and more economical way! Daring to think, speak, and act is the noble style needed in our great era of leaping development!

Cannot wait until exhausting objective truth before daring to think, speak, and act; only through daring to think, speak, and act can one's understanding be deepened step by step

Of course, how to dare to think, speak, and act better, or in other words, how to make what we think, say, and do closer to objective laws, is not an easy task. People can understand the objective world, but people's understanding of the objective world is not known at a glance, it is an infinite process of subjective reflection of the objective. People cannot wait until exhausting objective truth before daring to think, speak, and act. Such a day will never come, because the change and movement of the objective world will never end, and people's understanding of truth in practice will never end. Lenin said: "The limits of our knowledge approaching objective, absolute truth are historically conditional, but the existence of this truth is unconditional, and our gradual approach to it is unconditional." ("Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," People's Publishing House, 1956 edition, page 128). He also said: "Cognition is the eternal, unending approach of thought to the object." ("Philosophical Notebooks," People's Publishing House, 1956 edition, page 180). Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The process of occurrence, development, and elimination in social practice is endless, and the process of occurrence, development, and elimination of human knowledge is also endless." ("On Practice"). He also said: "Generally speaking, whether in the practice of transforming nature or transforming society, there are very few cases in which people's original ideas, theories, plans, and schemes are realized without any changes. This is because people engaged in transforming reality are often subject to many limitations, not only often subject to scientific and technological conditions, but also subject to the development of the objective process and the extent of its expression (the aspects and essence of the objective process have not been fully exposed)." (Ibid.). It seems very obvious that people can only rely on the level of understanding at a certain stage of development, and through daring to think, speak, and act, deepen their understanding step by step and continuously move forward. People's daring to think, speak, and act will not be foolproof, but often some, sometimes even a large part, of the situation does not conform to reality. But from here, people instead gain profound and complete experiences and lessons, making subjective understanding closer to objective laws, and continue to move forward. This kind of situation is originally an unavoidable phenomenon in the process of human cognitive development, but some people ignore this point. If they once discover that some situations in daring to think, speak, and act do not conform to reality, causing some temporary setbacks in work, they will be discouraged or pour cold water, "shooting the bird that sticks its head out," advocating that it is better to think, say, and do less, or even saying that it is best not to think, not to say, and not to do. For example, they advocate giving less or no ideas, less or no experience, less or no demands, the lower the indicators the better, and taking a "donkey entering the city, carrying things and naturally following into the city" attitude toward things. They think that this way they can be foolproof.

Thinking less, saying less, and doing less will only reduce people's practical experience, limit people's vision, and dull people's thinking

In fact, there is no one in the world who does not think, speak, or act. People are alive, people have brains, and objective things must be reflected in people's minds, forming certain ideas, and must be put into words and actions, otherwise, people cannot live. This is the scientific truth told to us by the Marxist-Leninist theory of reflection and Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity. The so-called not thinking, not speaking, and not doing is false and does not exist at all. As for thinking less, saying less, and doing less, this exists in a certain period, under certain circumstances, for some people, but from the overall historical development and the entire human race, with the development of production and class struggle, with the progress of material production, and the improvement of cultural life, people are definitely not thinking less, saying less, and doing less, but always thinking more, saying more, and doing more. Thinking less, saying less, and doing less will only delay the development of history, reduce people's practical experience, limit people's vision, and dull people's thinking, making it more likely for people to make mistakes, and will never reduce the possibility of making mistakes. Daring to think, speak, and act, being full of vigor, and being high-spirited is positive; thinking less, saying less, and doing less, being afraid of difficulties and seeking ease, and following old ways are negative, a kind of right-leaning emotion. This is an important contradiction. This boundary between positive and negative has great significance for people in terms of understanding, politics, and practical work. The entire universe, including the natural world and human society, all things, no matter how many twists and turns there are, is always a forward, upward movement. In this movement, if people strive to understand and master objective laws, dare to practice, promote the upward and forward movement of things, and promote historical development, what they think, say, and do is beneficial to mankind, and their positive attitude is what human progress needs. Conversely, if people think less, say less, and do less, do not seriously analyze the situation, study problems, come up with solutions, and formulate measures, and dare to do those things that could have been done, then they are taking a laissez-faire attitude towards the forward movement of things, the development of history, and the interests of the people. This negative, laissez-faire attitude is of course very harmful to human progress. In daring to think, speak, and act, due to the reasons mentioned above, some problems and shortcomings will inevitably arise, which we should criticize and correct; however, this criticism is to improve understanding, boost morale, and improve work, and is constructive and positive criticism. Conversely, if in order to avoid mistakes, one becomes passive, then one is making an even bigger mistake. There is also a small number of people who not only think less, say less, and do less themselves but also criticize others for daring to think, speak, and act, standing outside the mass movement, pointing fingers, pouring cold water on the vast number of cadres and masses, and spreading negative emotions, which is even more wrong. Lenin once said in 1907: "The Russian working class will certainly win freedom and promote the progress of Europe with its revolutionary actions full of mistakes; let those mediocre people who do nothing in the revolution boast of not making mistakes." ("Preface to the Russian Translation of the Collection of Letters from Bebel, Dietzgen, Engels, Marx, etc. to Sorge, etc."). Lenin's words are worth pondering. People can see that daring to take responsibility, daring to think about problems, daring to solve problems, having constructive opinions, being full of energy, standing with the masses, and quickly grasping and solving the difficulties and problems that occur in work, and bravely overcoming difficulties, is positive and greatly beneficial to the people's cause. And being afraid of difficulties, slackening off, and being discouraged, sighing in the face of difficulties, or making sarcastic remarks, even if the objective conditions permit and the task can be completed through subjective efforts, not daring to think, speak, or do, being perfunctory and lax, this negative attitude is very detrimental to the people's cause. In the past, in our long and arduous revolutionary struggle, right-leaning and negative emotions often appeared in some people, and even right-leaning opportunism appeared. Our Party resolutely fought against this emotion, overcame this emotion, united the revolutionary forces, held high the revolutionary banner, and fought bravely, finally winning the victory of the people's revolution. At present, a mood of fear of difficulty and slackening has grown among some cadres, which is obviously unfavorable to the socialist cause, and we are also resolutely criticizing and overcoming this right-leaning emotion.

It seems very obvious that people cannot not think, not speak, or not do; the idea of thinking less, saying less, and doing less is negative; standing outside the mass movement and criticizing and denouncing others for daring to think, speak, and act is harmful to the socialist cause. Our attitude is to insist on daring to think, speak, and act, and to advance along the road of practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding, and to actively strive to gradually understand and master objective laws, so that we can dare to think, speak, and act better. We must hold high the red flag of the general line, and in any work, we must be full of energy, not slacken off, strive to be upstream, not be content to be downstream, and be more, faster, better, and more economical, not less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Here, there is also the question of the boundary between daring to think, speak, and act and thinking, speaking, and acting wildly, which must not be confused. In daring to think, speak, and act, some situations of thinking, speaking, and acting wildly may appear, but people must never regard that daring to think, speak, and act that has a basis, has conditions, and has realistic possibilities as thinking, speaking, and acting wildly. There is a fundamental difference between them. The daring to think, speak, and act that we advocate is guided by Marxism-Leninism, has the correct direction, the correct standpoints and viewpoints, proceeds from reality, and closely relies on objective laws. Groundless fantasies cannot be considered daring to think, speak, and act. We oppose both thinking that transcends a certain stage of development of the objective process, that is, not being good at distinguishing between possibility and impossibility, not being good at distinguishing between the general possibility and the specific possibility among possibilities, and forcing ideals that only have realistic possibilities in the future to be done now; we also oppose thinking that lags behind the actual situation, that is, the objective process moves forward, but thinking cannot keep up with the objective situation, cannot stand at the forefront of the social wheel to guide the work, but complains that the car is moving too fast, and even wants to delay it. What we insist on is the unity of the subjective and the objective, and constantly opening up the road to understanding the truth in daring to think, speak, and act. The masses of the people for generations have never been frightened by the possibility of thinking, speaking, and acting wildly on their road forward, but have always adopted a positive attitude and resolutely followed the road of daring to think, speak, and act.

Insist on daring to think, speak, and act, and advance along the road of practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding

Insisting on daring to think, speak, and act, while striving to prevent thinking from transcending a certain stage of development of the objective process, and preventing possible thinking, speaking, and acting wildly, this has already been extremely rich experience for our Marxist-Leninist Party. Of course, we cannot comprehensively discuss these experiences in this article, but can only say a few points in combination with the current situation for the comrades' reference. These issues are also relatively familiar to everyone on weekdays.

First, we must attach importance to practice. Understanding comes from practice, and practice is the criterion for testing the truth of understanding. In the practice of transforming reality, people expose the essence of things and deeply understand them, and at the same time, through practice, people can correct wrong understandings and develop correct understandings. Housekeepers, handlers, and people with rich practical experience generally tend to think correctly, speak profoundly, and do things right. To dare to think, speak, and act better, we must dare to take responsibility, dare to take on burdens, and often pay attention to going to the scene in person, effectively organizing the actual work, and constantly reviewing our existing views based on reality. We must not have the slightest carelessness or relaxation in the great matter of personal practice.

Second, we must study, study Marxism-Leninism, study the documents of the Party Central Committee, study natural sciences, and so on. The daring to think, speak, and act that we advocate is guided by Marxism-Leninism, based on the Party's line and principles and policies, and combines revolutionary drive with scientific analysis. One of our urgent tasks now is to read seriously and improve our theoretical level. In the past, when we engaged in revolution, we studied the theory of class struggle; now, when we engage in construction, we must study the theory of economic construction. In industrial and agricultural production, we often deal with machines, electricity, blast furnaces, soil, fertilizers, water conservancy, and other things, and we must study mechanics, electricity, soil science, biology, chemistry, and other natural sciences. Studying is a long-term and arduous mental labor, requiring long-term planning and unremitting efforts.

Third, we must implement the Party's mass line. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us:
"The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous. Without understanding this, we cannot obtain the most basic knowledge." ("Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Surveys'"). Those who consult with the masses on matters, who come from the masses, who go to the masses, who are good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and who are good at uniting and relying on the masses, generally think, speak, and do more correctly, profoundly, and completely. Separated from the masses, sitting alone in a house and fantasizing, thoughts are always relatively poor. In implementing the mass line, we must be good at discovering the creativity of the masses, discovering the sprouts of new things, analyzing and summarizing them, understanding their universal significance, seeing their development prospects, and supporting them and promoting their growth. The emergence of new things is always weak at first and easily overlooked, but it represents a trend, reflects an objective requirement, and has strong vitality. Grasping the creativity of the masses and grasping the sprouts of new things as the starting point for daring to think, speak, and act, we will be able to see the "sunrise in the east" in time without falling into empty fantasies.

Fourth, for complex problems, do not use simplified methods to deal with them, but be good at specific analysis, grasp the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction, grasp the development and changes of the contradiction, pay attention to the particularity of the contradiction, and adopt working methods that conform to objective laws. For example, in summer distribution and autumn distribution, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual in a relatively short period of time, and there are many complex problems that need to be handled correctly. For this type of work, which is complex, specific, and changes greatly, if the way of thinking and working methods are simple, general, and fixed, then it is impossible to adopt corresponding methods according to the laws and characteristics of things. This is a problem of thinking methods and working methods. We must continue to seriously study materialist dialectics and apply it to actual work.

Fifth, we must attach importance to typical experiments. Some daily and confident work can be promoted immediately, but many tasks, especially some new and major tasks, must be tested, carefully mastered, carefully analyzed and summarized, and experience gained before gradually promoting them. Anything that has not been tested, has not been proven to be effective, and has not gained experience, should not be rushed to be widely promoted. Some experiments in a small range under special conditions, even if successful, if promoted in a larger range, it is also necessary to check the same and different conditions, adapt to local conditions, and resolutely and carefully promote them step by step.

Sixth, strengthen requests for instructions and reports. Generally speaking, higher-level organizations are familiar with the overall situation, stand tall, and see far. If lower-level organizations strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reports, they can have their correct views, experiences, plans, and measures affirmed by higher-level organizations, or get the due improvement. In this way, thinking will be clearer, understanding will be deeper, and implementation will be better. Conversely, if one's views, plans, etc. are wrong, they can also be corrected in a timely and rapid manner. Separating from the Party's resolutions and instructions and acting on one's own is not daring to think, speak, and act, but is unorganized and undisciplined.

The above-mentioned methods are certainly incomplete, but from them it can be seen that it is not impossible for us to insist on daring to think, speak, and act, while preventing thinking, speaking, and acting wildly. As long as we follow the principles of the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge and adhere to the unity of the subjective and the objective, and the unity of theory and practice, we will advance victoriously.

    论敢想敢说敢做
　　江苏“群众”十六期社论
    敢想敢说敢做，是我们伟大的飞跃发展的时代所需要的崇高风格
    在去年大跃进当中，在今年继续大跃进当中，敢想敢说敢做的精神，到处开花结果，发挥了人们所公认的伟大作用。许多敢想敢说敢做的人，敢于革新创造的人，敢于树立先进旗帜的人，由于他们英勇的创造性的劳动，受到了人们的赞扬、尊敬和效法。在历史上，许多革命家和科学家，献身于人民革命事业，献身于科学研究和创造发明，他们那种革命胆略，那种追求真理的大无畏精神，那种高瞻远瞩、大胆创造、千方百计推动历史前进和推动科学发展的艰苦劳动，向来被认为是敢想敢说敢做的榜样。在社会主义建设时期，敢想敢说敢做，打破陈旧传统的束缚，启发出蕴藏在人民群众中的聪明才智，正是体现了社会主义建设总路线的精神，符合于高速度地发展社会主义事业的要求。我们的社会主义建设事业，是伟大而又艰巨的。我们不仅要改变社会面貌，还要改变自然面貌，改变人们的精神面貌。在这样一个伟大而又艰巨的历史事业中，没有敢想敢说敢做的精神，显然是不行的。我们始终认定：敢想敢说敢做的革命胆略和求实精神的结合，是革命者的高贵品质。
    在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进的高潮中，江苏省和全国各地一样，敢想敢说敢做的鲜花，到处盛开。举例来说：水力采煤，曾被某些人说成是非常神秘的尖端技术，但是在去年大跃进当中，青山泉煤矿的工人和技术人员，立下了“不要国家投资，用土办法搞个水力采煤面”的雄心，在矿党委的领导下，克服了技术上的重重困难，凭两盘红炉，奋战七天，首创了水枪，接着又经过一个多月时间，用旧设备改制和改装了水力采煤的其他设备。这样，一共花了一千元，就建立起江苏省第一个水力采煤的工作面。去年，睢宁县人民，打破了只有山区才能建造水库的迷信，在平原上也建起了水库。睢宁县一百八十多万亩土地，是黄河冲积土壤，其中飞沙土占四十八万亩，历年易涝易旱，解放以后，虽然大力兴修水利，涝灾基本解除，但是旱灾的威胁仍然很大。县委曾经发动打井，开塘蓄水，仍然不能解决全部抗旱问题。有人说：“睢宁是绝地，无法解决旱灾”。可是县委用事实打破了这种迷信，在1957年冬和1958年春兴修水利的高潮中，决定利用废黄河的月堤建立水库，先后建成了韩坝等七、八座大小水库和广安大水库。其中仅广安水库，建成以后，就可以解决五十万亩旱田和二十万亩水稻的灌溉，并且还能使废黄河边年年受淹的十八万亩土地免除涝灾。在去年的抗旱斗争中，江宁县的群众曾经经过二百多道水车，翻过一百五十米高的山头，将六十里外的长江水，引进了干旱地区，得到了增产。这种动人的事例很多，在一篇文章里不可能一一列举。从已举的若干事例中，已经可以看出，敢想敢说敢做，对于大跃进，对于多快好省地发展社会主义建设事业，是多么的重要！敢想敢说敢做，是我们伟大的飞跃发展的时代所需要的崇高风格！
    不能等到穷极客观真理以后才去敢想敢说敢做；只有在敢想敢说敢做之中使自己的认识一步步深化
    当然，如何敢想敢说敢做得更好，或者说，如何使我们想的、说的、做的，更加接近客观规律，却不是一件轻而易举的事情。人是可以认识客观世界的，但是，人对客观世界的认识，并不是一望而知的，它是一个主观反映客观的无限的过程。人总不能等到穷极客观真理以后，才去实行敢想敢说敢做，这样的日子是永远不会有的，因为客观世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也永远没有完结。列宁说：“我们的知识对于客观的、绝对的真理的接近的界限是历史地有条件的，可是这个真理的存在是无条件的，我们之逐渐接近于它是无条件的。”（“唯物主义与经验批判主义”人民出版社1956年版，第一二八页）又说：“认识是思维对客体的永远的、不终止的接近。”（“哲学笔记”人民出版社1956年版，第一八○页）毛泽东同志说：“社会实践中的发生、发展和消灭的过程是无穷的，人的认识的发生、发展和消灭的过程也是无穷的。”（“实践论”）又说：“一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的，这是因为从事变革现实的人们，常常受着许多限制，不但常常受着科学条件和技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制（客观过程的方面及本质尚未充分暴露）。”（同上书）看来很明显，人们只能凭借一定发展阶段上的认识水平，在敢想敢说敢做之中，使自己的认识一步一步地深化，不断地向前发展。人们的敢想敢说敢做，不会是万无一失的，倒是常有一部分、有时甚至是很大的部分不合乎实际的情况出现。但是从这里，人们反而获得深刻的、完整的经验教训，使主观认识更加接近客观规律，并且继续前进。这样一种情况，在人的认识发展过程中，本来是不可避免的现象，但是却有一部分人忽视了这一点，他们如果一旦发现敢想敢说敢做之中，有一些不符合实际的情况出现，使工作受到一些暂时的挫折，就泄气或者泼冷水，“枪打出头鸟”，主张还是少想、少说、少做为好，甚至说什么最好是不想、不说、不做。例如他们主张少出或不出什么主意，少搞或不搞什么经验，少提或不提什么要求，指标越低越好，对事情采取“驴子进城捎带也自然跟着进城”的态度。他们以为这样就可以万无一失。
     少想少说少做，只会减少人们的实践经验，限制人们的眼界，钝化人们的思想
    其实，不想、不说、不做的人，世界上是没有的。人生活着，人有头脑，客观事物就一定要反映到人的头脑里来，形成一定的想法，而且一定要见诸语言、行动，不然，人就不能生活下去。这是马克思列宁主义的反映论和巴甫洛夫的高级神经活动学说所告诉我们的科学道理。所谓不想、不说、不做，那是假的，是根本不存在的事。至于少想、少说、少做，这在一定时期，一定情况下，就一部分人来说，是存在的，但是从总的历史发展和整个人类来说，随着生产和阶级斗争的发展，随着物质生产的进步，文化生活的提高，人决不是少想少说少做，而总是越来越多想多说多做。少想少说少做只会延缓历史的发展，减少人们的实践经验，限制人们的眼界，钝化人们的思想，使人们犯错误的可能性更大，而决不会减少犯错误的可能性。敢想敢说敢做，朝气蓬勃，斗志昂扬，是积极的；少想少说少做，畏难苟安，因循守旧，是消极的，是一种右倾情绪。这是一个重要的对立面。这个积极和消极的界限，在认识上、政治上和实际工作中，对于人们都具有重大的意义。整个宇宙，包括自然界和人类社会，一切事物，尽管它有多少曲折的道路，它总是一个前进的、上升的运动。在这个运动的过程中，人们如果努力去认识和掌握客观规律，勇于实践，促进事物的上升前进，推动历史发展，他们的所想所说所做，就是对人类有益的，他们这种积极态度，就是人类进步所需要的。反之，人们如果少想少说少做，不认真地去分析情况，研究问题，想出办法，订出措施，大胆去做那些本来可以做到的事情，那就是对事物的前进运动，对历史发展，对人民群众的利益，采取自流的态度，这种消极自流的态度，对于人类的进步当然是十分有害的。在敢想敢说敢做当中，由于上面所说的原因，难免会出现一些问题，产生一些缺点，这是我们应当批评纠正的；但是，这种批评是为了提高认识，鼓舞士气，改进工作，是建设性的积极的批评。反之，如果为了避免错误，就消极起来，那就是犯了一个更大的错误。还有一小部分人，不仅自己少想少说少做，还非难别人敢想敢说敢做，站在群众运动之外，指手划脚，向广大干部和群众大泼冷水，散布消极情绪，那更是错误的。列宁在1907年曾经说过：“俄国工人阶级用其充满错误的革命行动，是定会争得自由，推动欧洲前进的；让那些在革命方面无所动作的庸夫俗子去以不犯错误自夸吧。”（“伯克尔、狄慈根、恩格斯、马克思等人致左尔格等人书信集俄译本序言”）列宁的这句话，值得人们深思。人们都可以看到，敢于负责，敢于想问题，敢于解决问题，有建设性的意见，干劲十足，和群众站在一起，对于工作中所发生的困难和问题，迅速抓住加以解决，英勇地去战胜困难，这是积极的，对人民的事业大有好处。而畏难松劲泄气，在困难面前唉声叹气，或者冷言冷语，讲风凉话，对于本来是客观条件许可和经过主观努力可以完成的任务，也不敢去想、去说、去做，马马虎虎，松松懈懈，这种消极态度，对人民的事业是很不利的。过去，在我们长期的艰苦的革命斗争中，常常出现过一部分人的右倾消极情绪，甚至出现过右倾机会主义，我们的党坚决地向这种情绪进行了斗争，克服了这种情绪，团结了革命力量，高举革命的大旗，英勇奋战，终于取得了人民革命的胜利。目前，在一部分干部中，滋长了一种畏难松劲情绪，这对于社会主义事业显然是不利的，我们也正在坚决地批判和克服这种右倾情绪。
    看来很明显：人根本不可能不想不说不做；少想少说少做的想法，是消极的；站在群众运动之外，指责和非难人家敢想敢说敢做，是对社会主义事业有害的。我们的态度是坚持敢想敢说敢做，循着实践、认识、再实践、再认识的道路前进，积极努力去逐步认识和掌握客观规律，使我们敢想敢说敢做得更好。我们要高举总路线的红旗，在任何工作中，都是鼓足干劲，而不是松劲泄气，都是力争上游，而不是甘居下游，都是多快好省，而不是少慢差费。这里，还有一个敢想敢说敢做同乱想乱说乱做之间的界限问题，决不能混淆。在敢想敢说敢做当中，可能出现某些乱想乱说乱做的情况，但是人们决不能把那种有根据、有条件、有现实可能性的敢想敢说敢做，看成是乱想乱说乱做，它们是有原则区别的。我们所提倡的敢想敢说敢做，是以马克思列宁主义作为指导思想的，是方向对头，立场观点正确，从实际出发，紧紧依靠客观规律的。无根无据的空想，不能算是什么敢想敢说敢做。我们既反对思想超越客观过程的一定发展阶段，即不善于区别可能性和不可能性，不善于区别可能性当中的一般的可能性和具体的可能性，把仅在将来有现实可能性的理想，勉强地放在现时来做；我们又反对思想落后于实际的情况，即客观过程向前推进了，思想不能随着客观形势前进，不能站在社会车轮的前头作向导的工作，而是埋怨车子走得太快，甚至想延缓它。我们所坚持的是主观和客观的统一，在敢想敢说敢做当中不断地开辟认识真理的道路。世世代代的人民群众，在他们的前进的道路上，从来没有被什么乱想乱说乱做的可能性吓倒，而总是采取积极的态度，坚决地循着敢想敢说敢做的道路前进。
    坚持敢想敢说敢做，循着实践、认识、再实践、再认识的道路前进
    坚持敢想敢说敢做，同时努力防止思想超越客观过程的一定发展阶段，防止可能出现的乱想乱说乱做，这对我们马克思列宁主义的党来说，已经有极其丰富的经验。当然，我们在这篇文章里，不可能全面地来论述这些经验，只能结合当前实际，约略地说几点，供同志们参考。这些问题，也是大家平时比较熟悉的。
    首先，要重视实践。认识来源于实践，实践又是检验认识的真理性的标准。人们在变革现实的实践中，暴露事物的本质而深刻认识它们，同时通过实践，人们又可以纠正错误的认识，发展正确的认识。当家人，经手人，实践经验丰富的人，一般总是比较想得正确，说得深刻，做得对头的。我们要更好地敢想敢说敢做，一定要勇于负责，勇于挑担子，并且经常注意亲临现场，切实地组织实际工作的进行，并且不断地根据实际，审查自己已有的看法。对于亲身实践这样一件大事，不能有丝毫的疏忽、放松。
    其次，要学习，学习马克思列宁主义，学习党中央的文件，学习自然科学，等等。我们提倡的敢想敢说敢做，是以马克思列宁主义为指导，以党的路线和方针政策为准绳的，是革命干劲和科学分析相结合的。现在我们的迫切任务之一，是要认真读书，提高理论水平。过去搞革命，我们学习关于阶级斗争的理论，现在搞建设，就要学习关于经济建设的理论。在工农业生产中，我们经常和机械、电力、高炉、土壤、肥料、水利等等的东西打交道，就要学习力学、电学、土壤学、生物学、化学等等的自然科学。学习，是一个长期的艰苦的思想劳动，要有长期的规划，要作坚持不懈的努力。
    第三，要贯彻执行党的群众路线。毛泽东同志教导我们：
  “群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”（“‘农村调查’的序言和跋”）有事和群众商量，从群众中来，到群众中去，善于集中群众智慧的人，善于团结和依靠群众的人，他们的所想所说所做，一般总是比较正确、深刻和完全一些。脱离群众，一个人坐在房子里空想，思想总归是比较贫乏的。在贯彻执行群众路线当中，要善于发现群众的创造，发现新事物的萌芽，进行分析总结，认识它的普遍意义，看出它的发展前途，支持它和促进它成长壮大。新生事物的出现，起初总是弱小的，容易被忽视的，但是它代表着一种趋势，反映着一种客观要求，具有强大的生命力。抓住群众的创造，抓住新事物的萌芽，作为敢想敢说敢做的起点，我们就既能及时看出“日出东方”的东西，而又不致陷入凭空瞎想。
    第四，对于复杂的问题不要用简单化的方法去处理，而要善于具体分析，抓住主要矛盾和主要的矛盾方面，掌握矛盾的发展变化，注意矛盾的特殊性，采取符合于客观规律的工作方法。例如夏季分配和秋季分配，要在比较短的时间里，妥善处理国家、集体和个人之间的关系，这里面就有许多复杂的问题需要正确处理。对于像这样一类复杂、具体、变化很大的工作，如果思想方法和工作方法简单、笼统、固定不变，那就不能按照事物的规律和特点采取相适应的方法。这是一个思想方法和工作方法的问题，我们要继续认真地学习唯物辩证法，并把它运用到实际工作中去。
    第五，要重视典型试验。有些日常的、有把握的工作，可以立即推广，但是，有不少的工作，特别是一些新的重大的工作，一定要经过试验，认真地掌握，仔细地分析总结，取得经验，再逐步推广。凡是没有经过试验，没有证明确实有效并取得经验的事情，就不要急于普遍推广。有些在特殊条件下的小范围里的试验，即使成功了，如果在较大的范围里推广，也要检查相同和不同的条件，因地制宜，坚决而又细心地逐步推广。
    第六，加强请示报告。一般说来，上级组织熟悉全局，站得高，看得远，下级组织严格地执行请示报告制度，就可以使自己正确的看法、经验、计划、措施，得到上级的肯定，或者得到应有的提高。这样，思想更加明确，认识更加深刻，就会执行得更好。反之，如果自己的看法、计划等等有错误，也可以得到及时的、迅速的纠正。离开了党的决议指示，自作主张，那就不是敢想敢说敢做，而是无组织、无纪律了。
    以上所说的几点办法，当然是不完全的，但是从中已经可以看出，我们坚持敢想敢说敢做，同时防止乱想乱说乱做，并不是不可能的。只要我们循着马克思列宁主义认识论的原理，坚持主观和客观、理论和实践的统一，我们就会胜利前进。
