　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 14th - Zhejiang Province's early rice production this year is radiant and brilliant. Except for a few coastal areas affected by typhoons, the province's early rice yield per unit area generally increased by about 10% compared to last year, and many large-area high-yield plots with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu have emerged.

　　Wangzhou Commune in Fuyang County has 259 mu of land, with an average yield of 1,110.8 jin of dry rice per mu. Xiaoshu Commune in Anji County, a mountainous area in western Zhejiang, has 131.5 mu of terraced fields, with an actual yield of 1,014 jin of dry rice per mu. Shiyang Commune in Taishun County, a remote mountainous area in southern Zhejiang, has 42.5 mu of terraced fields with an average yield of 1,044 jin per mu. Large numbers of 1,000-jin fields have also appeared in the Hangjiahu and coastal plains of eastern Zhejiang. The early rice harvest in the Zhoushan Islands is also very noteworthy. In Baiquan Commune on Jintang Island, 532 mu out of 9,124 mu of harvested and threshed early rice exceeded 1,000 jin. The Hudou Production Team of Daizhong Commune on Daishan Island had an average yield of 2,034 jin of dry rice per mu on 11 mu of early rice.

　　In summarizing the experience of the bumper early rice harvest in Zhejiang Province, the broad masses of farmers deeply realized that: the bumper harvest is due to the good leadership of the Communist Party, the great strength of the People's Commune, and the blossoming of the Eight-Character Constitution.

　　Early sowing, early transplanting, sufficient base fertilizer, and careful management are the prominent characteristics of Zhejiang's early rice production this year. The degree of close planting of early rice this year is generally higher than last year, with an average of about 30,000 seedlings transplanted per mu. The 1,000-jin fields and 2,000-jin fields that have appeared in various parts of the province have all been reasonably and densely planted. For example, most of the 275 mu of 1,000-jin fields in Yinzhu Commune in Tonglu County were densely planted at 5x3, with about 40,000 seedlings transplanted per mu.

　　From early rice sowing and transplanting to field management, all parts of Zhejiang have paid close attention to applying more fertilizer and applying it well. This year, a year-round manure accumulation campaign was launched throughout the province, with millions of commune members going up mountains and down to the sea to collect fertilizer, thereby improving the soil and promoting the growth of large rice plants with thick ears. For example, in Luhua Commune on the Zhoushan Islands, where more than 200 mu of 1,000-jin fields appeared, mass manure accumulation campaigns were launched several times after transplanting, and sufficient topdressing fertilizer, heading fertilizer, and grain-protecting fertilizer were applied to the early rice.

　　Selecting good seeds is also a common concern this year. The area sown with good varieties of early rice in the province this year has increased from about 50% last year to more than 70%. The Liangzhong Breeding Farm of Luqiao Commune in Huangyan County, led by farmer seed expert Yang Kuangbao, has more than 1,000 mu of high-yield fields all sown with excellent varieties. "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes." These early rice plants grow like a yellow carpet, with the same height for each rice plant, the same size of panicles, no pests or diseases, no barnyard grass, and little lodging.

　　Zhejiang Province has also paid special attention to field management this year, striving for excellence in every measure, with each link interlocking and not relaxing on any of them. From the beginning of early rice sowing, all communes and production teams in the province quickly launched a campaign to exceed production targets and exceed plans, comprehensively mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and strategies, and launching a field management competition to protect the panicles, protect the grains, and protect the bumper harvest. After transplanting, the broad masses of commune members vigorously attacked the three barriers of fertilizer, pests and diseases, and lodging; at the same time, they implemented fixed personnel and fixed fields to strengthen management. During the harvest, all localities emphasized careful harvesting and threshing. It is estimated that more than 80 million jin of grain can be harvested additionally.

　　Zhejiang Province has now completed its summer harvest and summer planting, and more than 7 million mu of double-cropping late rice have been transplanted. The bumper early rice harvest has made the broad masses of commune members and cadres more and more enthusiastic, and they are applying the experience of early rice production to late rice, striving for late rice to surpass early rice and the whole year to exceed production targets.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 13th - After a month of hard work by more than 4.8 million farmers of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the region has completed the harvesting of 12 million mu of early rice. The five regions of Yulin, Wuzhou, Nanning, and Baise, which harvested earlier, are now making every effort to carry out summer planting and field management of late rice.

　　In the first summer harvest after communization, encouraging news of bumper harvests spread everywhere in Guangxi. Whether in mountainous or plain areas, most areas have achieved increased production, except for a very small number of areas where production was reduced due to torrential rain. The Xiaopingshan Commune's Maijiu Brigade in Yulin County, on the plains of southeastern Guangxi, has had a particularly good harvest this year. The 2,827 mu of early rice that has been harvested has an average yield increase of 42% compared to last year. The Pingtang Brigade of Chengxiang Commune in Luchuan County has 1,650 mu of early rice, with an average yield increase of more than 30% compared to last year and 80% compared to the good weather year of 1957. The Liuchen Commune in Pingnan County, which had suffered from floods, still achieved a bumper harvest of 3,234 mu of early rice after the commune members fought to rescue it. The average yield per mu was 422 jin. The 10,872 mu of early rice distributed in the mountain valleys and on the mountaintops of Tongmian Commune in Ningming County have generally grown well, and the average yield per mu of the harvested portion has increased by 40% compared to last year.

　　In May and June, when early rice matured in Yulin, Wuzhou, Nanning, Guilin, and other regions of Guangxi, they encountered several strong winds and heavy rains, and more than 1.22 million mu of early rice were hit by floods. After the disaster occurred, party committees at all levels immediately organized more than 1.6 million people to drain the water and rescue the crops. As a result, in addition to about 300,000 mu of early rice that was more severely affected by the disaster and had reduced yields, the yields of generally less damaged early rice were still higher than in previous years.

　　浙江广西喜摘早稻丰收硕果
    本报杭州14日电  浙江省今年早稻生产光辉灿烂，大放异彩。除了沿海少数地区受台风影响外，全省早稻单位面积产量一般都比去年增产10％左右，而且出现了许多亩产千斤以上的大面积高额丰产片。
    富阳县的王洲公社，有二百五十九亩田，平均亩产干谷一千一百一十点八斤。浙西山区安吉县晓墅公社有一百三十一亩半山田，每亩实收干谷一千零十四斤。浙南偏僻山区泰顺县仕阳公社有四十二亩半梯田平均亩产一千零四十四斤。杭嘉湖和浙东沿海平原也出现了大批千斤田。舟山群岛的早稻丰收也很引人注意。金塘岛白泉公社已收割脱粒的九千一百二十四亩早稻有五百三十二亩超过千斤。岱山岛岱中公社虎斗生产队十一亩早稻平均亩产干谷二千零三十四斤。
    浙江省广大农民在总结早稻大丰收的经验中，大家都深刻的认识到：丰收是共产党领导好，是人民公社力量大，是八字宪法开了花。
    播种早、插得早、底肥足、管理细，是今年浙江早稻生产突出的特点。今年早稻密植程度一般都比去年提高，平均每亩插秧三万丛左右。全省各地出现的千斤田、双千斤田，都是进行了合理密植的。例如桐庐县印渚公社二百七十五亩千斤田大多是密植5×3，每亩插秧四万丛左右。
    从早稻播种、插秧到田间管理，浙江各地都十分注意多施肥、施好肥。今年全省开展了常年积肥运动，几百万社员上山、下海，大搞肥料，从而改良了土壤，促使早稻棵大穗粗。例如舟山群岛出现的两百多亩千斤田的芦花公社，插秧以后，连续多次展开群众性的积肥运动，早稻的分蘖肥、吊穗肥、保穗肥都施足施好。
    选用良种，也是今年普遍注意的问题。全省今年一千四百多万亩早稻，良种播种面积已由去年的50％左右增加到70％以上。农民种子专家杨匡保领导的黄岩县路桥公社良种繁育场，一千多亩丰产田全部播用优良品种，“龙生龙，凤生凤”，这些早稻长得像一片黄毯，丘丘稻禾一样高低，穗头一般大小，没有虫害、病害，没有稗草，很少倒伏。
    浙江省今年也特别注意田间管理，每项措施都力求精益求精，一环扣一环，环环不放松。早稻播种开始，全省各公社、生产队就迅速展开了超包产、超规划运动，全面发动群众献计献策，展开保穗、保粒、保丰收的田间管理竞赛。插秧后，广大社员又猛攻肥料、病虫害和倒伏三关；同时实行定人、定田，加强管理。在收割中，各地都强调了细收细打，据估计，可多收八千多万斤粮食。
    浙江省目前夏收夏种完毕，连作晚稻已插下七百多万亩。早稻的大丰收，使全省广大社员和干部干劲越来越大，正在把早稻丰产经验用到晚稻上去，力争晚稻超早稻，全年超包产。
    新华社南宁13日电广西僮族自治区四百八十多万各族农民经过一个月的奋战，全区一千二百万亩早稻收割完毕。收割较早的玉林、梧州、南宁和百色五个专区，正全力突击夏种和晚稻田间护理工作。
    公社化后的第一个夏收里，广西到处传来振奋人心的丰收喜讯，不论山区或平原，除极少部分地区因遭受暴雨减产外，绝大部分地区获得增产。桂东南平原上的玉林县小平山公社卖酒大队今年收成特别好，已收打的二千八百二十七亩早稻，平均亩产比去年增加42％。陆川县城厢公社洴塘大队一千六百五十亩早稻，平均亩产比去年增产三成多，比风调雨顺的1957年增产80％。曾经遭受过洪水灾害的平南县六陈公社，全社三千二百三十四亩早稻，经全社社员奋战抢救，仍获得丰收。平均亩产四百二十二斤。宁明县桐棉公社分布在山弄、山顶的一万零八百七十二亩早稻，普遍生长良好，已收打的部分平均亩产比去年增产四成。
    5、6月份，广西玉林、梧州、南宁、桂林等地区早稻成熟时，遇到几次大风大雨，有一百二十二万多亩早稻受到洪水袭击。灾情发生后，各级党委立即组织一百六十多万人排水抢救。结果，除约三十万亩左右受灾较严重的早稻减产外，一般损失较轻的早稻产量仍高于往年。
