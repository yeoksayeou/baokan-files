　　A Record of Drought Resistance in Huazigang
　　Han Han
　　As the car arrived at Huazigang, upon getting out, I immediately saw ditches about two feet wide on both sides of the road. Muddy water was flowing along these ditches towards the fields on either side of the road. The parched crops in these fields were greedily sucking up this sweet water. This water was bought with people's sweat, drop by drop!
　　Huagang Commune is one of the communes in Feixi County, Anhui Province, that is suffering severely from drought. The entire commune has more than 27,000 mu of land affected by the drought. However, the cadres and members of this commune have not lost their confidence in winning a bumper harvest because of the drought. On the night of August 1st, the commune Party secretary led reporters to visit Daguantang, a large pond in the commune with an area of more than 1,000 mu, which could irrigate more than 30,000 mu of farmland. Here, I saw the astonishing drive and the ambition of "man will conquer nature" of the commune cadres and masses in their fight against the drought.
　　Approaching the edge of the pond, the loud calls of the people operating the waterwheels and the rumbling of the water pump motors broke the silence of the night sky. The night shift water-drawing army was taking advantage of the cool of the night to launch a fierce battle against the drought. When we arrived at the pond, the first thing we saw was dozens of strong young people installing the water pipes for the second water pump, which had just been transferred from the county. One of the young men was already covered in sweat. "Is he also a member of the commune who came to fight the drought?" "No, he is our doctor at the construction site. Because we have good labor protection, there hasn't been a single case of heatstroke in the past few days, so the doctor has had to change professions," a comrade in charge of the construction site replied with a humorous smile. Ninety-six waterwheels were rolling rhythmically. A waterwheel with a red flag inserted in it was particularly eye-catching. On the waterwheel, an old man was cranking the water while singing a labor song. He is Lu Jingqiang from the Sixth Brigade. As soon as the commune called for drought resistance, he immediately took the lead. When the cadres advised him to rest, he said angrily, "This is the time to scoop up water to grab a bowl of rice, how can you ask me to rest?" He often said to other members of the commune, "Drought resistance is like fighting a fire, and抢 water is like抢 grain! If the heavens don't send rain, we will crank干 the water of Daguantang to fight for a bumper harvest!" His words reflected the sentiments of all the members of the Huagang Commune.
　　In all the brigades of Huagang Commune, regardless of men, women, old or young, they have all joined the fight against drought. Those who have machines use machines, and those who have waterwheels use waterwheels. In production teams where water sources are scarce and tools are lacking, they use buckets, basins,瓦罐 (earthenware pots)… On the morning of the 2nd, we came to Qunguang Brigade, which has a high terrain and lacks tools. From afar, we saw the army of men and women fighting the drought, distributed around various ponds and rice fields; some were cranking water with waterwheels, and more were using ropes to scoop water with a bucket together. Most striking were the eighty-odd primary school students who were appearing and disappearing in the cornfields that were more than a meter tall. They didn't have any water-carrying tools, but they had brought small buckets, basins, and earthenware teapots… from their homes. The older children carried a bucket of water together, while the younger ones carried water in basins. The children carried罐 (jars) and pots of water, carefully watering the corn, which had already curled from the drought, one plant at a time. Some even used their hands to cover the already watered corn roots with dry soil. They ran back and forth carrying water, watering as they sang: “…As long as we have great determination, we won’t fear any drought!”
　　In recent days, after the concerted efforts of all cadres and members of the commune, the crops that were more severely affected by the drought throughout the commune have been irrigated. Of the 30,000 mu of mid-season rice, a harvest can be guaranteed, and more than 5,000 mu of corn have also been generally irrigated once or twice. The commune Party secretary said with confidence: "We have the confidence to recover all the drought-stricken crops, not to let a single mu of land suffer from drought, and not to report a single mu of disaster!"

　　花子岗抗旱记
　　韩寒
    汽车到达花子岗，刚一下车，便看到了公路两旁二尺来宽的水沟，浑浊的水流正沿着沟渠向公路两旁的田里流去。这些田里的焦渴的庄稼，贪婪地吮吸着这些甜美的水。这水，是人们一滴滴汗水换来的！
    花岗公社是安徽省肥西县干旱较严重的一个公社，全社有二万七千多亩土地受旱。可是这个公社的干部和社员，并没有因为干旱而失去了夺取丰收的信心。8月1日的夜晚，公社党委书记带领记者参观了公社的一个有一千多亩面积，可灌溉三万多亩田地的大官塘。在这里，我看到了公社干部和群众与干旱作斗争的惊人干劲和“人定胜天”的雄心。
    临近塘边，车水的人们响亮的号子声和抽水机隆隆的马达声，划破了夜空的宁静，夜班的车水大军正乘着夜间的凉爽，和干旱展开激烈的斗争。到塘边时，首先看到的是几十个身体强壮的青年人正在安装刚由县里调来的第二部抽水机水管。其中一个青年已累得满头大汗了。“他也是来抗旱的社员吗？”“不，他是我们工地的医生。因为我们劳动保护得好，几天来一个中暑的也没有，医生只得转业了。”一位工地负责同志诙谐地笑着回答了我。九十六部水车在有节奏地滚动着。一辆插有红旗的水车特别引人注意。水车上，一位老人正边车着水，边唱着号子。他是第六大队鹿经强。公社一号召抗旱，他就一直带头干。干部劝他休息，他却生气地说：“这正是瓢水抢碗稻的时候，怎能叫我去休息？”他常对其他社员说：“抗旱如救火，抢水如抢粮！老天不下雨，我们就车干大官塘的水来争丰收！”他的话正反映了花岗公社全体社员的心意。
    在花岗公社所有的大队中，不论是男女老少，都已投入抗旱斗争。他们有机器的用机器，有水车的用水车。在水源缺乏，而工具又少的生产队，他们便用水桶、面盆、瓦罐……。2日的上午，我们来到地势高、工具少的群光大队。老远地便看到了男男女女的抗旱大军，分布在各个池塘边和水田里；有用水车车水的，而更多的是两人合用一只水桶用绳索舀水。最引人注意的是出没在一人多高的玉米地里的八十多个小学生。他们没有提水工具，却从家里找来了小水桶、面盆、瓦茶壶……大一点的孩子两人合抬一桶水，小点的有的用脸盆端水。孩子们提着一罐罐一壶壶的水在旱得已经卷叶的玉米地里一棵棵细心地浇灌着。有的还用双手将已浇过的玉米根用干土盖起来。他们提着水来回地奔跑着，一边浇灌，一边唱着：“……只要我们决心大，旱灾再大都不怕！”
    连日来经过全体干部和社员的奋力抗旱，全社受旱较重的作物都已经得到灌溉，三万亩中稻已经能够保收，五千多亩玉米也都普遍浇灌了一交至两交。公社党委书记充满信心地说：“我们有信心夺回所有受旱的庄稼，不让一亩田受旱，不报一亩灾！”
