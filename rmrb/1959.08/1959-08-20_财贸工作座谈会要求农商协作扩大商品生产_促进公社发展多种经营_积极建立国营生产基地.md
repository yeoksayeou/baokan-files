Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th – The Finance and Trade Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a rural finance and trade work symposium in Harbin, focusing on how finance and trade departments can closely cooperate with agricultural departments to promote the active development of diversified operations while developing grain production in rural areas, and expand commodity production.

Participating in the meeting were the ministers of the Finance and Trade Work Departments of the Party committees of thirteen provinces (autonomous regions), including Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as well as some responsible cadres of finance and trade work in counties and people's communes. The Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade also sent people to participate in the meeting.

Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Finance and Trade Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the beginning of the meeting that the purpose of this meeting was to promote finance and trade departments to strengthen cooperation with agricultural departments and develop diversified operations, in order to obtain more commodities to meet the growing needs of industrial production and people's lives, and to ensure the supply of export goods.

According to the reports from various provinces at the meeting, since the beginning of this year, the Party committees in various places have strengthened their leadership over diversified operations. Therefore, while grain production has greatly developed, diversified operations have also developed greatly. Whether it is the raising of poultry, livestock, bees, and silkworms, the cultivation of fruit trees, medicinal materials, daylilies, and tree ears, the collection and processing of chemical raw materials and wild plants, the manufacture and repair of daily necessities and small farm tools, or the production of fish and bricks, tiles, and lime, all have increased to varying degrees. Short-distance transportation has also developed. The situation of diversified operations is very good. However, there are still some problems between regions, between varieties, and between self-sufficient production and commodity production, which need to be resolved in the future.

The meeting believed that one of the keys to developing diversified operations is to comprehensively plan and uniformly arrange the production of grain, cash crops, and diversified operations. The experience of many places has proven that as long as we proceed from the objective reality of local natural resources, labor, and capital, and make overall arrangements, grain and diversified operations can be developed simultaneously. In 1958, while grain production increased greatly, diversified operations also developed greatly. For example, in Sichuan Province in 1958, the total output value of products belonging to diversified operations increased by 47% compared with 1957; in Heilongjiang Province in 1958, the total output value of diversified operations increased by 135% compared with 1957. The development of diversified operations can not only produce a large amount of raw materials and commodities to supply the needs of industrial production and people's lives, but also accumulate funds for people's communes to carry out farm tool reforms and agricultural mechanization, promote the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization and commune industrialization in rural areas, and further develop production.

The meeting pointed out that in order to rapidly develop diversified operations and expand commodity production, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between commercial departments and agricultural departments. In this regard, first of all, it is necessary to formulate production plans in a unified manner based on local conditions and national needs, and to implement the plans in people's communes and even contracted production units. When formulating plans, it is necessary to correctly arrange the proportional relationship between various varieties. Not only grain, cash crops, and diversified operations need to be developed in a planned and proportional manner, but also there must be a certain proportion between the varieties of diversified operations and between self-sufficient production and commodity production in order to meet national needs. Therefore, it is required that agricultural and commercial departments work together to calculate natural resource accounts, variety accounts, labor accounts, self-sufficient production accounts, commodity accounts, economic benefit accounts, total output value accounts, and distribution accounts in order to make production plans conform to objective reality and promote the comprehensive development of diversified operations. Secondly, agricultural-commercial cooperation to develop state-owned production bases is an effective measure to increase the amount of commodities. This type of production base is controlled by the state, and departments in charge at the county level and above can run it. The characteristics of production bases are that the amount of commodities is large and concentrated, which can play a role in stabilizing and regulating the market, and can play a demonstrative and promoting role in the production of collectives and individuals. According to national construction needs, resource conditions, and management traditions, the production bases of some products can also be operated by people's communes. Commercial departments should also assist government agencies, enterprises, and schools in developing non-staple food production through the supply of breeding livestock, poultry, seeds, and means of production, so that they can gradually achieve self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in non-staple foods. Third, appropriately divide the scope of operations; collective operations and individual operations should be taken into account. Generally speaking, those that require a lot of investment, are technically demanding, and are difficult for a single production brigade to run can be operated by the commune; those that are production-intensive and require a lot of labor, such as seasonal collection, large-scale planting and breeding, and processing of agricultural and sideline products, are suitable for production brigade operations; those that are relatively scattered and can be produced year-round are suitable for operation by contracted production units. At the same time, it is also necessary to organize commune members to develop household sideline occupations, such as planting vegetables and feed on feed land, raising small livestock and poultry, collecting wild plants, weaving, fishing, and hunting. Fourth, according to the different seasons and production needs, as well as the differences in laborers (male, female, old, young, strong, and weak), help the people's communes to appropriately arrange their labor so that everyone can give full play to their labor potential and expertise. Fifth, finance and trade departments should help production departments organize diversified operations, such as helping communes survey resources, formulate plans, sell products, provide technical guidance, and do a good job in product procurement and the supply of means of production. Rural finance and financial departments should start from production, help communes arrange funds, strengthen accounting, establish and improve accounts and financial management systems, implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running communes, rationally use funds, expand accumulation, and promote the development of production.

In terms of purchasing work, the meeting pointed out: Cash crops such as hemp and tobacco leaves have begun to be harvested in some areas, and the peak season for collecting mountain goods and native products is also approaching. The quality of the procurement of agricultural, sideline, and native products directly affects industrial production and market supply. Commercial departments in various places must quickly make preparations, seize the opportunity, and vigorously purchase. While doing a good job in purchasing work, attention should also be paid to arranging consumption, which has a great relationship with increasing the amount of commodities. Commercial departments must help people's communes and commune members rationally arrange the amount of commodities and the amount of self-sufficiency, and increase the amount of commodities through rational arrangement of consumption and guidance of consumption. In the work of purchasing fresh eggs in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, the commercial department cooperated with the agricultural department and adopted the method of "quantifying and revealing the bottom line" through consultation with the masses to determine that a certain number of eggs produced by each chicken should be sold to the state, and the rest should be disposed of by themselves. This not only arranged the consumption of the masses and the needs of hatching eggs, but also ensured the completion of the state's purchasing tasks, which was generally welcomed by the masses. They felt that they had a bottom line in their hearts. By the end of June, Baiquan County had almost completed the annual egg purchasing task. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously believed that this experience of applying the working method of the Party's mass line to purchasing work is worthy of learning and promotion in various places.

The meeting discussed the issue of restoring and rectifying the rural repair industry. The meeting believed that leadership should also be strengthened in this work in the vast rural areas, so that some repair industry practitioners who have already changed careers can return to their posts, give full play to the role of the repair industry in repairing old and turning useless into useful, and combine waste product recovery with repair business to facilitate the lives of the masses, save the masses' expenses, and save social wealth.

At the meeting, some problems related to primary markets that have already emerged in various places and the political and ideological work of finance and trade workers were also discussed.

The meeting emphasized the need to strengthen the political and ideological work of employees in the finance and trade system and strengthen the Party's leadership over finance and trade work. Finance and trade workers must put politics in command. Only with correct positions and viewpoints can they correctly understand and apply objective economic laws and do a good job in economic work. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, finance and trade departments should assist agricultural departments in vigorously mobilizing the masses, exerting great efforts, and completing and overfulfilling the production tasks of grain, cash crops, and diversified operations; strengthen the publicity and education of the whole country as a coordinated chess game and the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance, so that farmers will sell agricultural and sideline products more actively, support cities, industrial and mining areas, forest areas, and support industrial construction. Urban industry has powerfully supported agricultural production, and will support agricultural production even more powerfully in the future.

During the meeting, Yang Yichen, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a comprehensive speech on the situation, experience, and problems of finance and trade work in Heilongjiang Province. Representatives from other provinces also exchanged work experience. The meeting was finally summarized by Ma Mingfang.

    财贸工作座谈会要求农商协作扩大商品生产
　　促进公社发展多种经营
　　积极建立国营生产基地
    据新华社哈尔滨19日电　中共中央财政贸易工作部最近在哈尔滨召开农村财贸工作座谈会，着重讨论了财贸部门如何与农业部门密切协作，促进农村在发展粮食生产的同时，积极发展多种经营，扩大商品生产等问题。
    参加这次会议的有，河北、山西、内蒙古、河南、湖南、四川、江苏、江西、安徽、陕西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等十三个省（自治区）党委的财政贸易工作部部长，以及一部分县和人民公社的财贸工作负责干部。中共中央农村工作部和商业部、对外贸易部也都派人参加了会议。
    中共中央财贸部部长马明方在会议开始时指出，这次会议的目的是，推动财贸部门加强与农业部门协作，发展多种经营，以取得更多的商品，供应工业生产和人民生活日益增长的需要，并保证出口的货源。
    根据各省在会上的汇报，今年以来，各地党委加强了对多种经营的领导，因此在粮食生产大发展的同时，多种经营生产也有了很大的发展。无论是禽、畜、蜂、蚕的饲养，果树、药材、黄花、木耳的培植，化工原料、野生植物的采集和加工，日常生活用品和小农具的制造和修补，以及捕鱼、砖瓦石灰的生产等，都有了不同程度的增长。短途运输也有发展。多种经营发展的形势是很好的。但是，在地区之间，品种之间，自给性生产与商品性生产之间，还存在着一些问题，有待于今后解决。
    会议认为，发展多种经营的关键之一，是全面规划、统一安排粮食、经济作物和多种经营的生产。许多地方的经验证明，只要从当地的自然资源、劳动力、资金的客观实际出发，统筹安排，粮食与多种经营生产是可以同时发展的。1958年在粮食生产大增产的同时，多种经营也有了很大的发展，如四川省1958年属于多种经营产品的总产值，比1957年增长了47％；黑龙江省1958年多种经营产品的总产值比1957年增长了135％。多种经营的发展，不但可以生产大量原料和商品，供应工业生产和人民生活的需要，还可为人民公社进行农具改革和农业机械化筹积资金，促进农村逐步实现农业机械化和公社工业化，进一步发展生产。
    会议指出，为了迅速地发展多种经营，扩大商品生产，必须加强商业部门与农业部门的协作。在这方面，首先要因地制宜，根据国家需要，统一制定生产规划，并使规划落实到人民公社以至包产单位。在制定规划时，要正确地安排各种品种之间的比例关系。不仅粮食、经济作物和多种经营需要有计划、按比例地发展，而且在多种经营的品种之间，自给性生产和商品性生产之间，也都要有一定的比例，才能适应国家需要。因此，要求农业和商业部门协同算好自然资源账、品种账、劳动力账、自给性生产账、商品账、经济效果账、总产值账和分配账，以求生产规划符合客观实际，促进多种经营全面地发展。其次，农商协作，发展国营生产基地，是增加商品量的一个有效的措施。这种生产基地由国家掌握，县以上各级主管部门都可以举办。生产基地的特点是商品量大而集中，可以起稳定和调节市场的作用，可以对集体和个人的生产起示范、推动作用。根据国家建设需要、资源条件和经营传统，有些产品的生产基地也可以由人民公社经营。商业部门还要通过供应种畜、种禽、籽种、生产资料等工作，协助机关、企业、学校发展副食品生产，使他们逐步做到副食品自给或部分自给。第三，适当划分经营范围；集体经营和个人经营应当兼顾。一般说，凡是投资多、技术性较强、一个生产大队难以举办的，可以由公社经营；生产集中、需要劳动力多的，如季节性采集、大面积种植养殖、农副产品加工等，适宜于生产大队经营；比较零星的、常年可以生产的，适宜于由包产单位经营。同时，还要组织社员发展家庭副业，如用饲料地种植蔬菜、饲料，饲养小家畜、家禽，采集野生植物，编织，渔猎等。第四，要按照季节和生产需要的不同，以及劳动者男、女、老、少、强、弱的不同，帮助人民公社适当地安排好他们的劳动，使每一个人都能发挥出自己的劳动潜力与专长。第五，财贸部门要帮助生产部门组织多种经营，如帮助公社勘察资源、制定规划、推销产品、进行技术指导、做好产品收购和生产资料供应等工作。农村财政金融部门要从生产出发，帮助公社安排资金，加强核算，建立健全账目和财务管理制度，贯彻勤俭办社的方针，合理使用资金，扩大积累，促进生产的发展。
    在采购工作方面，会议指出：麻类、烟叶等经济作物在一些地区已经开始收割，山货、土特产品的采摘旺季也即将到来，农副土特产品采购的好坏，直接影响到工业生产和市场供应，各地商业部门必须迅速做好准备，抓紧时机，大力收购。在做好采购工作的同时，还要注意安排好消费，这对于增加商品量有着很大的关系。商业部门必须帮助人民公社和社员合理安排商品量和自给量，通过合理安排消费，指导消费，增加商品量。黑龙江省拜泉县在收购鲜蛋工作中，商业部门与农业部门协作，通过与群众协商，采取“定量交底”的办法，确定每只鸡所产的蛋按一定数量出售给国家以后，其余自行处理。这样既安排了群众的消费和孵化用蛋的需要，又保证了国家收购任务的完成，群众普遍欢迎，觉得心中有底了，到6月底，拜泉县已接近完成全年鸡蛋收购任务。与会同志一致认为，这种把党的群众路线的工作方法运用于采购工作的经验，值得各地学习推广。
    会议讨论了恢复与整顿农村修理行业的问题。会议认为，在广大农村中也应当加强对这一工作的领导，让某些已经改行的修理业从业人员归队，充分发挥修理行业整旧翻新、变无用为有用的作用，并且把废品收购与修补业务结合起来，以便利群众生活，节省群众开支，节约社会财富。
    会上，还讨论了各地已经出现的有关初级市场的一些问题和财贸职工政治思想工作等问题。
    会议强调要加强对财贸系统职工进行政治思想工作，加强党对财贸工作的领导。财贸工作人员必须政治挂帅，只有具有正确的立场、观点，才能正确的认识和运用客观经济规律，做好经济工作。财贸部门应当在党委统一领导下，协助农业部门大力发动群众，鼓足干劲，完成和超额完成粮食、经济作物和多种经营生产任务；加强全国一盘棋和工农联盟、城乡互助的宣传教育，使农民更加积极地出售农副产品，支援城市、工矿、林区，支援工业建设。城市工业已经有力地支援了农业生产，今后将更有力地支援农业生产。
    会议期间，中共黑龙江省委书记杨易辰就黑龙江省财贸工作的情况、经验和问题作了全面的发言。其他各省的代表也交流了工作经验。会议最后由马明方作了总结。
