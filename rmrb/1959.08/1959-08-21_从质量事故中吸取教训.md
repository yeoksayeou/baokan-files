    Learn from Quality Accidents
    I recently followed the Provincial Party Committee's industrial inspection team to the Gannan Electric Motor Factory to inspect their work. I discovered that the first batch of new products produced by this factory were all scrapped. What exactly happened?
    It turns out that when this factory accepted the task of producing new electric motors, they put them into production without trial production. During the production process, they modified the design in many places. In the manufacturing process, they also failed to strictly follow the technological regulations. For example, the burrs on the silicon steel sheets were too large, but no measures were taken to file them off. The number of silicon steel sheets for the stator and rotor laminations were less than the specified quantity, and the stator winding was not in accordance with the technological requirements.
    I believe that the leaders of this factory lack a comprehensive understanding of the socialist construction policy. They only one-sidedly emphasized quantity and speed, neglecting quality and economy. They thought that as long as the motor could turn, it would be fine, and they did not consider the quality of the product at all. In addition, the leaders and some technicians of this factory did not have a sufficient understanding of the principle of combining breaking superstitions with respecting science, so they casually modified the design. When some experienced workers pointed out that this would cause problems, they did not listen. Furthermore, the technological order of this factory was relatively chaotic, and there was no set of qualified tools and equipment for processing products, which affected the quality of the products.
    This accident not only wasted a large amount of state materials, but more importantly, it affected the timely completion of the state plan. I hope that this factory will learn from this accident and reverse the erroneous view of neglecting quality.

### 从质量事故中吸取教训

    从质量事故中吸取教训
    我最近随着省委工业检查团到赣南电机厂检查工作，发现这厂生产的第一批新产品，全部报废了。这究竟是怎么回事呢？
    原来这厂接受电动机新产品任务时，没有经过试制，就投入了生产，在生产过程中，又修改设计许多处。在制造过程中，他们也没有严格按照工艺规程办事，如矽钢片毛刺过大，而不采取锉毛刺的措施，定转子矽钢片叠片都比规定数量少，定子下线等不合乎工艺要求。
    我认为这个厂领导上对建设社会主义的方针是缺乏全面认识的，他们只片面地强调多快，忽视好省，认为电机搞出来能转就行了，对于产品的质量漫不考虑。另外，这个厂的领导上和部分技术人员对破除迷信尊重科学相结合的原则，也认识不足，以致随便修改设计。当有的老师傅提出这样会出毛病时，他们也不听。再就是这个厂的工艺秩序比较混乱，加工产品时没有一套合格的工具和设备，以致影响了产品的质量。
    这次事故，不仅浪费了大批的国家材料，更重要的是影响了国家计划的按时完成。希望这个厂吸取这次事故的教训，扭转忽视质量的错误看法。
