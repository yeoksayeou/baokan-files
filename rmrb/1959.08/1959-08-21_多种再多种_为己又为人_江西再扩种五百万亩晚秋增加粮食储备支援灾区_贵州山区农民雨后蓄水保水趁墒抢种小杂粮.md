Plant More and More: For Ourselves and for Others
Jiangxi to Expand Late Autumn Planting by Five Million Mu to Increase Grain Reserves and Support Disaster Areas
Guizhou Mountain Farmers Store Water After Rain and Seize Moisture to Rush Plant Minor Grains

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 20th) The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, at a provincial telephone conference held a few days ago, called on the people of the province to expand the planting of late autumn crops by another five million mu in the next week, on the basis of the two million mu of autumn crops already sown, to maximize planting and harvesting, to increase their own grain reserves and support disaster-stricken areas across the country.

The autumn production situation in Jiangxi this year is very good. The two million mu of autumn crops sown throughout the province have been sown at the right time, the sowing quality is high, and the growth is very good, surpassing any previous year. Since the beginning of July, although some areas have experienced drought, which has had a certain impact on the growth of crops, the drought-affected area in the province is only four million mu. After more than 20 days of drought resistance, coupled with the recent widespread rain, the drought-affected crops have basically been relieved of the threat of drought. The crops that have not been affected by drought are growing even better because of the rain. The bumper harvest of early rice and the good growth of autumn crops have greatly encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the province.

Rainfall has occurred in various parts of Jiangxi since August 10. According to recent statistics, areas with rainfall of 50 mm or more account for 50% of the province, areas with 20 to 50 mm account for 30%, and the remaining areas have also received 20 mm of rain. The people of the province immediately seized this favorable opportunity and quickly launched a new high tide of rush planting. According to statistics up to the 18th, 1.4 million mu of late autumn crops such as soybeans, buckwheat, corn, sweet potatoes, millet, and mung beans have been rush planted throughout the province.

In this campaign to expand planting, many areas have put forward the battle cry of "Plant more and more, for ourselves and for others," mobilizing 50% to 80% of the labor force to join the battle. In Xiushui and Ji'an counties, 100,000 laborers were mobilized to fight day and night in the fields. In two days, Xiushui County rush planted 40,000 mu of various late autumn crops, and Ji'an County decided to rush plant 80,000 mu during the rush planting week. In Ruichang and Nancheng counties, the rush planting armies were personally led by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, and more than 100,000 mu of late autumn crops were planted in two days.

In this battle, the people's commune showed its unique and great role, and the large-scale operations and large-scale collaboration were organized more rationally and orderly. The rush planting armies in various places are generally organized into specialized teams according to crops, each responsible for rush planting. There is also a clear division of labor within the specialized teams, with some tilling the land, some fertilizing, and some sowing. Therefore, this campaign, which is large in scale and has many tasks, is carried out in an orderly manner. The rush planting not only seized the opportunity, but also ensured the quality. In the large-scale collaboration, all localities adhered to the principle of equal exchange, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and gave play to the communist style of helping each other in times of need. In the rush planting in Ji'an County, 17 brigades of Guanji and Yongchun of Wanfu Commune took the initiative to organize more than 900 members, bringing ploughing cattle and farm implements to support the nine brigades of Jingkeng and Hongxing, which had more fields and less labor. Therefore, the difficulties of labor, ploughing cattle, and seeds in some areas during the rush planting were smoothly resolved. (Li Jiuzhe)

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The mountains of Guizhou Province have experienced widespread and welcome rain, and farmers of all ethnic groups are seizing the rainy season to vigorously store water and rush plant late autumn crops. In the past week, 1.36 million mu of crops such as autumn buckwheat and potatoes have been rush planted. In Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Tongren Prefecture, where rainfall has been heavy, most of the paddy fields are basically full of water.

Since August 4, the mountainous areas of Guizhou Province have generally experienced continuous light and moderate rain, with rainfall of about 50 mm, and the summer drought has eased, and some areas have basically been relieved of the threat of drought. Under the battle cry of "Striving for every drop of water and ensuring a bumper harvest," the people's communes quickly and properly arranged labor, and timely organized temporary rush planting teams during the rainy season, rushing to irrigate the fields on the one hand, and planting late autumn crops while taking advantage of the rain on the other. According to the statistics of Shuicheng County for two days after the rain, more than 50,000 people repaired 467 mountain interception ditches and more than 3,500 mountain ponds and dams, making more than 60% of the water conservancy projects full of water.

While rushing to conserve water for drought resistance and rush planting, all localities have also strengthened field management of major autumn crops, investing in labor for intertillage, topdressing, and manure accumulation, generally accounting for about 30%, basically achieving drought resistance, field management, and autumn planting without delaying any of the three.

    多种再多种　为己又为人
    江西再扩种五百万亩晚秋增加粮食储备支援灾区
    贵州山区农民雨后蓄水保水趁墒抢种小杂粮
    本报南昌20日电　中共江西省委在前几天召开的全省电话会议上，号召全省人民在已播种两千万亩秋季作物的基础上，在最近一个星期再扩种五百万亩晚秋作物，最大限度地实现多种多收，以增加自己的粮食储备，并支援全国受灾地区。
    江西今年秋季生产形势非常好。全省播种的两千万亩秋季作物，由于播种适时，播种质量高，生长十分好，超过了以往任何一年。7月上旬以来，虽然部分地区发生了旱灾，给作物的生长带来一定影响；但全省受旱面积不过四百万亩，经过二十多天的抗旱斗争，又加最近普遍落雨，受旱作物已基本上解除了旱灾的威胁。未受旱的作物因为得雨生长更好。早稻的大丰收，秋季作物的生长良好，大大鼓舞了全省人民的革命干劲。
    江西各地自8月10日起降雨，据最近统计，降雨达五十毫米以上的地区占全省50％，二十至五十毫米的地区有30％，其余地区也落了二十毫米的雨。全省人民立即抓紧这一有利时机，迅速掀起了新的抢种高潮。到18日的统计，全省已抢种了大豆、荞麦、玉米、红薯、粟、绿豆等晚秋作物一百四十万亩。
    在这场扩种突击战中，许多地区提出了“多种再多种，为己又为人”的战斗口号，动员了50％以至80％的劳动力投入战斗。修水、吉安两县各调集了十万劳动大军，日夜奋战田间。修水县两天中抢种下各种晚秋作物四万亩，吉安县决定在突击周内抢种八万亩。瑞昌、南城两县抢种大军由各级党委书记亲自率领，两天内共种下晚秋作物十万多亩。
    在这场战斗中，人民公社显示了他特有的巨大作用，大兵团作战和大协作组织得更合理更有秩序。各地抢种大军一般都按作物编成专业队，各自负责抢种。在专业队内部也有明确的分工，翻地的翻地，施肥的施肥，下种的下种。因此，规模大，任务多的这场突击战斗搞得有条不紊。抢种不仅抓住了时机，而且保证了质量。各地在大协作中，一面坚持等价交换互助互利的原则，一面发挥了患难相扶的共产主义风格。吉安县抢种中，万福公社的官汲、永春十七个大队主动组织了九百多个社员，带了耕牛和农具去支援田多劳力少的净坑、红星等九个大队。因此某些地区在抢种中的劳动力、耕牛、种籽等困难便顺利解决。　（李久泽）
    据新华社讯　贵州山区普降喜雨，各族农民抓紧雨期大力蓄水保水，抢种晚秋作物。近一周内，已抢种秋荞麦、洋芋等作物一百三十六万亩。降雨较多的黔南布依族苗族自治州和铜仁专区，大部分水田基本蓄满了水。
    8月4日以来，贵州山区普遍连续降小雨和中雨，雨量在五十毫米左右，夏旱现象已趋和缓，部分地区基本上解除了干旱威胁。在“滴水必争、力保丰收”的战斗口号下，各人民公社迅速妥善安排了劳力，及时组织了雨期临时突击队，一面抢水灌田，一面趁雨种植晚秋作物。仅据水城县雨后两天的统计，就有五万多人修补了四百六十七条拦山沟和三千五百多处山塘水坝，使60％以上的水利工程蓄满了水。
    在抢水抗旱和抢播的同时，各地还加强了大秋作物的田间管理，投入中耕、追肥、积肥的劳力，一般约占30％左右，基本上做到了抗旱、田间管理、秋播三不误。
