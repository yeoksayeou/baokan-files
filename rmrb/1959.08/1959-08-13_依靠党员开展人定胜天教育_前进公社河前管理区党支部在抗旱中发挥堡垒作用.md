Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 12th: Although the Heqian Management District of the Qianjin People's Commune in Chuxiong County, Yunnan Province, has suffered a prolonged and severe drought this year, under the strong leadership of the Party branch and the leading role of Party members, not a single rice seedling has died so far. The masses are in high spirits, and the attendance rate of many production teams has reached 100%. The masses commented on the local communists: "With a mouth, they can discuss matters with everyone; with a pair of hands, they can take the lead in hard work."

From the beginning of spring plowing to transplanting this year, the Heqian Management District has not had any rain. At the beginning of transplanting, some cadres were afraid that there would be no water to protect the seedlings after transplanting, so they were reluctant to release water, and the lack of oxen made the planting progress very slow, with only 42 mu planted per day in the entire management district. In order to ensure full planting and transplanting according to the season, the Party branch successively raised questions to Party members and all commune members, such as "Can increased production be guaranteed if transplanting is not done according to the season?" and "Should we transplant rice seedlings if it doesn't rain?". Through debate, everyone's understanding was improved, and it was unanimously decided to immediately release water and transplant rice seedlings while fighting the drought. At the same time, Luo Cungao, the Party branch secretary, and Huang Guoqiang, the brigade captain, successfully experimented with plowing fields with horses, which was even more effective than plowing with oxen. The difficulty of insufficient oxen was also overcome, and the masses were even more encouraged, and the daily planting speed in the entire management district quickly rose to 83 mu.

Next, the Party branch held a meeting of Party members to commend good people and good deeds, and called on Party members to take the lead in various tasks such as plowing fields and transplanting rice seedlings, so as to speed up the transplanting and save water. Soon, Xu Zhanxuan, the Party member captain of the Hedi Chang Production Team, created a record of plowing six mu of land per day, and Yang Shuzhen, a member of the Party branch committee, also created a record of transplanting 1.7 mu of rice seedlings in one day. Through these typical examples, the Party branch committee launched a high-efficiency competition for rushing to plant and transplant among the masses, which greatly improved the transplanting speed. In the absence of rain, the entire management district completed the transplanting task of more than 3,300 mu of large spring crops in 25 days, and the planting quality exceeded any previous year.

After the transplanting was completed, the struggle to fight drought and protect seedlings began. Through the extensive activities of Party members, the Party branch studied and analyzed the three attitudes of the masses towards drought resistance: one group actively demanded drought resistance, and most of them were poor and lower-middle peasants; another group did not oppose drought resistance, but believed that it had snowed this spring, and the auspicious snow heralds a bumper year, and they had the idea of waiting for rain; the third group believed that drought resistance was a waste of effort if it did not rain, and this group accounted for only a small number. The branch decided to hold a meeting, at which it used methods such as recalling and comparing the past to help the second group establish a positive idea of drought resistance, and to persuade the third group to participate in the struggle to fight drought and protect seedlings.

A vivid mass self-education movement began. Zhang Wenqing, an 81-year-old man from the Heqian Production Team, also brought a rotten quilt from before liberation and a newly bought large floral quilt to the venue. He pointed to the rotten quilt and said that in 1947, a drought starved 51 people in Heqian Township. The drought in 1958 was even worse than that year, but with the leadership of the Party, 37 waterwheels were set up to draw water to fight the drought. Not only did no one starve to death, but the entire management district also increased its grain production by more than 340,000 jin. If we don't fight the drought this year, we can only blame ourselves for not working hard enough. The meeting was very lively, and people were educated at the meeting. Many people's attitude towards drought resistance changed from passive to active. After the meeting, the Zenggan Production Team set up eight waterwheels on the river bank overnight and drew water to irrigate the fields in shifts. In the Bailong Xin Village Production Team, where the drought was more severe, some people carried grain to the mountains to find water sources, and some people carried water from a mile away to save the seedlings. Even children went up the mountains to pull leaves to cover the fields to reduce water evaporation. Many production teams put 100% of their labor force into drought resistance and mid-cultivation and summer hoeing activities.

By the beginning of July, the drought continued to develop. Two-thirds of the 3,000 mu of rice fields in the entire management district were about to dry up, and most of the corn was also curled up due to drought. Many rice fields were irrigated in the morning and dried up in the afternoon. Faced with such a serious situation, some people wavered in their confidence in overcoming the drought. They believed that the large spring crops could not be protected, and demanded that efforts be concentrated on accumulating fertilizer for the small spring crops after autumn; others developed the passive mood of waiting for rain because there was often a little rain. At this time, the Party branch used Party lessons to educate Party members and activists on the nature and tasks of the Party, the rights and obligations of Party members, and the glorious tradition of the Party's hard work, and called on all Party members and cadres to stand on the most arduous and difficult posts in the fight against drought and lead the masses to fight the drought to the end. Communists went to the forefront of the fight against drought. Chen Chaoxin, the captain of the Zengping Production Team, and Wu Yonggui, a Party member, led the masses to persist in drawing water for more than 40 days. They had twice drained the river water and collected the water that had stopped flowing within two kilometers one by one to continue drawing water to irrigate the fields. Luo Cungao, the secretary of the Party branch, was busy leading the fight against drought during the day, and still went to the fields to draw water after midnight. Many commune members who were already asleep were moved and got up again to draw water with the Party branch secretary side by side. Many Party members often worked hard even when the masses were resting. Under the leadership of the communists, the attendance rate of many production teams reached 100%. The tenacious struggle of Party members and the masses ensured that not a single rice seedling had died in the entire management district.

In this long-term drought resistance struggle, the Party branch's organizational life was very active. Generally, it insisted on holding two Party lessons a month, two to three branch meetings, and three to five group activities. Under the leadership of the Party branch, communists often used the slogan "To be a good blacksmith, one must have a strong body" to encourage themselves. They were loved by the masses. Among the 26 Party members in the entire branch, 22 were successively selected as labor models or various production experts. In Chuxiong County, this Party branch has continuously maintained the title of advanced branch with "good political leadership, good production leadership, good concern for the masses, and good cadre style."

    依靠党员开展人定胜天教育
    前进公社河前管理区党支部在抗旱中发挥堡垒作用
    新华社昆明12日电　云南省楚雄县前进人民公社河前管理区今年虽然遭到持久的严重干旱，但是在党支部的坚强领导和党员的带头苦干下，至今没有干死过一棵稻苗，群众斗志昂扬，许多生产队的出勤率达到百分之百。群众评论那里的共产党员说：“有口一张，遇事能和大家商量；有手一双，生产能够带头苦干。”
    从今年春耕开始到栽插，河前管理区就一直没有下雨。栽插开始时，一部分干部怕栽秧以后无水保苗，迟迟不愿放水，加上耕牛不足，栽种进度非常迟缓，全管理区每天只栽四十二亩。为了保证按节令满栽满插，党支部先后向党员和全体社员提出了“不按节令栽插能不能保证增产”和“天不下雨要不要栽秧”等问题，组织辩论。辩论结果，大家认识提高，一致决定立即放水抗旱栽秧。同时，党支部书记罗存高和大队长黄国强试验用马犁田成功，效果比用牛犁田还高。耕牛不足的困难也克服了，群众受到更大鼓舞，全管理区的每天栽插速度很快就上升到八十三亩。
    接着，党支部召开党员大会表扬好人好事，号召党员在犁田、栽秧等各项工作中带头，加速抢栽速度，以便节约用水。不久，河底场生产队党员队长徐占瑄创造了日犁田六亩的纪录，党支部委员杨淑珍也创造了一天栽秧一亩七分的纪录。支委会通过这些典型事例，在群众中发起了一个抢栽抢插的高工效竞赛，使栽秧速度大大提高。全管理区在天不下雨的情况下，二十五天就完成了三千三百多亩大春作物的栽秧任务，而且栽种质量超过了以往任何一年。
    栽插完成以后，进入了抗旱保苗斗争。党支部通过党员的广泛活动，研究和分析了群众对抗旱的三种态度：一种人积极要求抗旱，他们大多数是贫农、下中农，另一种人不反对抗旱，但认为今春下过雪，瑞雪兆丰年，有等天下雨的思想，第三种人认为天不下雨，抗旱是白费力气，这种人只占少数。支部便决定召开大会，在会上用回忆对比等方式，帮助第二种人树立积极抗旱的思想，说服第三种人参加抗旱保苗斗争。
    一个生动的群众性自我教育运动开始了。河前生产队八十一岁的老人张文清，把解放前的一床烂被和最近新买的一床大花被子也抱到会场上来，他指着烂被子说，1947年一场旱灾，河前乡饿死了五十一个人，1958年的干旱比那一年还大，但是有了党的领导，架起三十七台水车车水抗旱，不但没有饿死人，全管理区还增产了三十四万多斤粮食。如果今年不抗旱，那只能怪我们干劲不足了。这次大会开得非常热烈，人们在会上受到教育，很多人对抗旱的态度由消极变为积极。增干生产队会后连夜就在河边搭棚架起八台水车，轮班车水灌田。干旱较重的白龙新村生产队，有的人背上粮食上山去找水源，有的人从一里路外挑水救苗，连小孩子也上山扯树叶子盖田，以减少水分蒸发。许多生产队百分之百的劳动力投入了抗旱和中耕夏锄活动。
    到了7月初，旱情继续发展。全管理区三千亩稻田眼看已经干了三分之二，玉米多数也旱得卷了叶子，许多稻田上午灌水下午就干了。在这样严重的情况面前，有些人又动摇了战胜干旱的信心，他们认为大春保不住了，要求集中力量为秋后的小春作物积肥；另有一些人，因为经常有点小雨，又滋长起等天下雨的消极情绪。这时候，党支部通过上党课，对党员和积极分子进行了党的性质和任务、党员的权利和义务、以及党的艰苦奋斗光荣传统的教育，号召全体党员、干部在抗旱中站到最艰苦、最困难的岗位上去，带领群众同旱灾坚决斗争到底。共产党员们走上了抗旱斗争的最前线。增平生产队队长陈朝信、党员吴永贵带领群众坚持车水四十多天。他们曾两次车干河水，并且把两公里内已经断流的河水一处一处地汇集在一起，继续车水灌田。党支部书记罗存高白天忙着领导抗旱，半夜以后还下田车水，许多已经睡觉的社员，感动得又起来同支部书记并肩车水。许多党员往往在群众休息了，他们还在苦干。在共产党员的带动下，许多生产队的出勤率达到百分之百。党员和群众的顽强斗争，保证了全管理区一直没有干死过一棵稻苗。
    在这持久的抗旱斗争中，党支部的组织生活非常活跃，一般每月都坚持上两次党课，举行两次到三次支部大会，进行三次到五次小组活动。在党支部的领导下，共产党员们时常用“打铁要靠自身硬”这句口号来勉励自己。他们受到群众的爱戴，全支部的二十六个党员中，就有二十二人先后被选为劳动模范或多种生产能手。在楚雄县，这个党支部连续保持着“政治挂帅好，领导生产好、关心群众好、干部作风好”的先进支部称号。
