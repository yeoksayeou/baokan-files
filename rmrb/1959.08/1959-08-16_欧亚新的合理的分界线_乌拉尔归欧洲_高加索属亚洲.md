A New and Rational Demarcation Line Between Europe and Asia
　　The Urals Belong to Europe, the Caucasus to Asia

Where exactly is the dividing line between Europe and Asia? The answers to this question vary in many geography books, with the biggest disagreement concerning the demarcation of the Caucasus region between the two continents.

In the Soviet Union, which straddles Europe and Asia, many geographers recently concentrated their efforts on exploring this issue and defining a new and rational demarcation line. There are no significant differences in the natural conditions of Europe and Asia. The climate, soil, and vegetation are similar at the junction of the two continents. The only natural difference is the structure of the land surface, which reflects the geological history of the region.

Geographers usually use this as a basis to divide the continents of Europe and Asia along the Urals and the Caucasus. But where exactly is this boundary, since the Ural Mountains are 150 kilometers wide? Therefore, the accuracy of the boundary cannot even reach one kilometer. Moreover, the old boundary either divided the Urals in half or the Caucasus in half.

The Moscow branch of the All-Union Geographical Society recently discussed this issue. After consulting with many geographers, it was decided to suggest that the continental boundary between Europe and Asia be: along the eastern foothills of the Ural Mountains and the Mugodzhar Mountains, via the Emba River, then along the northern coast of the Caspian Sea, across the Kuma-Manych Depression to the Kerch Strait. In this way, the entire Urals belong to Europe, and the entire Caucasus belongs to Asia. The Sea of Azov is also included in the European boundary. In the future, all geography books used as teaching materials will be divided according to this suggestion.

### 欧亚新的合理的分界线  乌拉尔归欧洲　高加索属亚洲

    欧亚新的合理的分界线
    乌拉尔归欧洲　高加索属亚洲
    欧洲和亚洲的分界线究竟在哪里？这个问题的回答在许多地理书上的回答都是不同的，其中分歧最大的是高加索地区欧亚两洲分界的问题。
    在地跨欧亚的苏联，最近集中许多地理学家的力量，探讨了这个问题，并且划定了新的、合理的分界线。欧亚两洲的自然条件没有重大差别。在两洲交界处气候相似，土壤相似，植物也没有多大差别。唯一自然差别是地面的结构，这种结构反映了地区的地质史。
    地理学家通常就是根据这点，沿乌拉尔和高加索划分欧亚两洲的洲界的。可是这条界线究竟在什么地方，因为乌拉尔山的宽度达一百五十公里。因此，分界线的精确度甚至不能达到一公里。而且旧的分界不是把乌拉尔分成两半，就是把高加索分成两半。
    全苏地理学会莫斯科分会最近讨论了这个问题。许多地理学家商量的结果，决定建议欧亚两洲的洲界是：沿乌拉尔山和木哥扎雷山的东麓经恩巴河，再沿里海北岸，过库马马内奇盆地到刻赤海峡。这一来，整个乌拉尔都归欧洲，而高加索也全部属于亚洲了。亚速海也列入欧洲疆界。今后所有作教材用的地理书都将按照这个建议来划分欧亚界线。
