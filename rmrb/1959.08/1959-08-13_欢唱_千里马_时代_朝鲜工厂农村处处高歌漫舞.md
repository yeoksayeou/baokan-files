Singing the Praises of the "Chollima" Era
　　North Korean Factories and Rural Areas Resound with Song and Dance

　　North Korea is a nation of song and dance. Today, in North Korea's "Chollima" era, northern workers and farmers dance more enthusiastically and sing more joyfully than ever before.

　　Every factory and agricultural cooperative in the north has its own amateur arts organization for workers and farmers. For example, in South Hamgyong Province, there are more than 7,400 music, dance, and drama groups, with 220,000 people participating in the activities of these arts organizations. The Hwanghae Iron Works alone has more than 40 amateur arts groups. The activities of these worker and farmer amateur arts groups are very rich and varied.

　　At the Hwaphong Mine Club, there is a workers' entertainment group with more than 380 members who participate in vocal, dance, drama, and orchestral activities. They have their own dance and drama directors, as well as talented lyricists and composers. This year, on May Day, the workers performed a small dance drama "Dance of the Ore Carriers," which they wrote and directed themselves, and received good reviews.

　　The Chongjin Steel Works Club has a cinema with a capacity of more than 1,300 people, as well as rooms with modern equipment for amateur cultural and artistic groups to carry out activities, such as a technical publicity room, a literature room, an art room, a traditional music room, and a library, as well as a room for the female workers' embroidery group. The club not only has instruments such as pianos and traditional instruments such as flutes, but also has more than 800 stage costumes. Workers can use these facilities at will and can also receive systematic guidance from the factory's cultural and artistic staff.

　　In the thousands of amateur arts groups in factories and rural areas, the broad masses of working people often create artistic programs based on their own labor and lives, which in turn serve production. The workers of the Ryongsong Machine Factory created "Song of the Lathe Operators" and the dance drama "A Day in the Life of a Foundry Worker"; the employees of the Geomdeok Mine created and performed the multi-act drama "The Innovators" based on real people and events at the mine, praising production innovators and criticizing conservative ideas, which promoted production in their unit and became one of the best programs in the country. The members of an agricultural cooperative in Mundeok County wrote and performed the puppet show "The Fat Cow and the Skinny Cow," which praised and criticized two breeders in a novel and interesting way, greatly promoting the work of the cooperative members.

　　欢唱“千里马”时代
　　朝鲜工厂农村处处高歌漫舞
    朝鲜是个能歌善舞的民族。今天，在朝鲜的“千里马”时代，北部工人和农民比过去任何时候都舞得更热、唱得更欢。
    北部的每一个工厂和农业社，都有工人和农民自己的业余文艺组织。例如，在咸镜南道，各种音乐、舞蹈、戏剧小组共有七千四百多个，有二十二万人参加这些文艺组织的活动。黄海制铁所一家工厂就有四十多个业余文艺小组。这些工农业余文艺小组的活动十分丰富多采。
    在和丰矿山俱乐部，有个工人文娱小组，拥有三百八十多名组员，分别参加声乐、舞蹈、话剧、管弦乐等艺术活动。他们有自己的舞蹈和话剧导演，也有作词作曲的能手。今年“五一”节，工人演出了自己编导的小型舞剧“运矿工之舞”，获得很好的评价。
    在清津炼钢厂的俱乐部里，设有可容一千三百多人的电影院和技术宣传室、文学室、美术室、民族乐室、图书室、管弦乐室等具有现代设备的业余文化艺术小组进行活动的房间，还有女工刺绣小组的房间。俱乐部里不仅备有钢琴等乐器和笛子等民族乐器，还备有八百多件舞台服装。工人们可以随意利用这些设备，还能得到工厂的文艺工作人员的有系统的指导。
    在工厂和农村的成千上万个业余文艺小组里，广大劳动人民经常以自己的劳动和生活为主题，创造文艺节目，反过来为生产服务。龙城机械厂的工人们创作了“旋工之歌”、舞剧“铸铁工的一天”；检德矿山的职工以这座矿山的真人真事创作、演出了多幕话剧“革新者们”，歌颂了生产革新者，批判了保守思想，推动了本单位的生产，并成为全国的优秀节目之一，文德郡的一个农业社的社员们自编自演的傀儡戏“肥牛和瘦牛”，以新颖有趣的形式表扬和批评了两个饲养员，大大推动了社员们的工作。（附图片）
