Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th (TASS) - "Pravda" published an editorial on the 5th entitled "For Universal Peace," stating that the "greatest international event" is how peace-loving people in all countries evaluate the news of the upcoming mutual visits between Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev and U.S. President Eisenhower.

The editorial stated that the statements simultaneously published by the Soviet and U.S. governments in Moscow and Washington express the hope that the upcoming visits will promote better understanding between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and advance the cause of peace. All good people in the world sincerely share this hope.

The editorial said that people of all countries are very concerned about the development of Soviet-U.S. relations. They deeply know that the fate of universal peace depends to a large extent, even decisively, on the relationship between the two major powers. Chairman of the Soviet government, Khrushchev, said at a mass meeting in Dnepropetrovsk on July 28: "Our country and the United States are the two most powerful countries in the world. If other countries fight each other, they can be pulled apart. However, if a war breaks out between the United States and our country, no one will be able to stop it. This will be a large-scale disaster. Therefore, every effort must be made to resolve all existing disputes without war, to ease international tensions, and to ensure the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social and political systems."

The editorial said that the Soviet people hope to live in peace and friendship with the American people, just as with the people of all other countries. The entire Soviet foreign policy is aimed at achieving this lofty goal. The Soviet government has consistently adhered to the principle that, despite the different social systems of the Soviet Union and the United States, the interests of our two peoples coincide on many important issues. Whether Americans or Soviets, they are equally concerned about defending peace and developing peaceful cooperation, and about strengthening trade, scientific, and cultural ties between the two major countries. Life itself requires expanding trade between our two countries, increasing contacts between people at all levels in the Soviet Union and the United States, and striving for a fair resolution of mature issues. As for the Soviet government, everyone knows that it is sparing no effort in this regard.

The Soviet Union holding an exhibition in New York, the United States holding an exhibition in Moscow, Mikoyan's and Kozlov's visits to the United States one after another not long ago, and the recent visit of U.S. Vice President Nixon to our country, all of these are important links in a series of measures to improve relations between our two countries. It is quite obvious that the more contacts between national leaders, the better they can understand each other, and the more helpful it is to eliminate everything that hinders the development of friendly relations between countries.

Recently, on July 24, Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the opening ceremony of the American Exhibition in Moscow expressed the thoughts and wishes of the entire Soviet people. He said: "We would be glad if U.S. President Eisenhower had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union. I believe that such a visit would be of great benefit to improving relations between our two countries and consolidating world peace." The Soviet public was very pleased to hear the news of the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. In the near future, when the U.S. President comes to the Soviet Union, he will have the opportunity, as we hope, to see with his own eyes that the entire Soviet people engaged in peaceful creative labor are ardent defenders of peace, and they are full of determination to make all necessary efforts to eliminate the "Cold War" and normalize Soviet-U.S. relations.

The editorial said that international public opinion believes that the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower is a historically significant event that will not only have a positive impact on the further development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States but will also contribute to universal peace. This is why all people who hope for peace so warmly welcome the mutual dispatch of goodwill missions between the two major countries and regard mutual visits as a good omen for the improvement of the international situation.

It is gratifying that President Eisenhower himself expressed the hope at a press conference in Washington on August 3 that the upcoming exchange of views with the head of the Soviet government would help melt the ice in Soviet-U.S. relations. This view was endorsed by all ordinary Americans, many congressmen and senators, Republicans and Democrats. Democratic leader Stevenson said: "I believe that the Soviet Premier's visit to the United States will greatly promote the consolidation of world peace and the restoration of relations between the two countries."

The editorial said that the news about the upcoming meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower has been most warmly welcomed in the capitals of most countries in the world and among the people of all countries. All good people regard this as a victory for reason, peace ideas, and the policy of peaceful coexistence. Only those who are afraid of strengthening peace and do not want the normalization of the international situation will be alarmed and saddened by this news.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of all countries warmly and sincerely believe that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower will help improve mutual understanding between our two major countries and contribute to universal peace.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论指出
    苏美首脑相互访问有助和平
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在5日以“为了普遍和平”为题发表社论说，“最大的国际事件”——这是各国爱好和平的公众对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔即将进行的相互访问的消息的评价。
    社论说，在莫斯科和华盛顿同时公布的苏联政府和美国政府的声明中表示希望，即将进行的访问将促进美苏两国之间建立更好的了解，并且将促进和平事业。世界上一切善良的人们也都真诚地抱着这种希望。
    社论说，各国人民都非常关心苏美关系的发展。他们深深地知道，普遍和平的命运在很大的程度上、甚至在决定性的程度上取决于两个大国之间的相互关系。苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫7月28日在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克群众大会上的讲话中说：“我国和美国是世界上两个最强大的国家。如果其他国家彼此打起来，那还可以把它们拉开。但是，如果美国和我国之间发生战争，那就没有人能制止这场战争了。这将是一场大规模的灾难。因此，必须尽一切努力不用战争来解决现存的一切争执问题，要尽力缓和国际紧张局势和保证不同社会制度和政治制度的国家和平共处”。
    社论说，苏联人民希望，像同所有其他各国人民一样，同美国人民和平友好相处。苏联整个外交政策都是为了达到这一崇高的目的。苏联政府一贯遵循的原则是：尽管苏联和美国的社会制度不同，但是，在不少的重大问题上，我们两国人民的利益是相吻合的。无论美国人，还是苏联人，都同样关心保卫和平和发展和平合作，关心加强两大国之间的贸易、科学和文化联系。生活本身要求扩大我们两国之间的贸易、增加苏联和美国各级人士之间的接触、力求公正地解决业已成熟的问题。至于苏联政府，大家都知道，它在这方面是不遗余力的。
    苏联在纽约举办展览会，美国在莫斯科举办展览会，不久前米高扬和科兹洛夫先后访问美国，以及最近美国副总统尼克松访问我国，这一切都是改善我们两国关系的一系列措施中的重要环节。十分明显，国家领导人之间的接触越多，就越能更好地相互了解，就更有助于消除阻碍国与国之间友好关系发展的一切东西。
    最近，7月24日，赫鲁晓夫同志在莫斯科美国展览会开幕式上的讲话表达了全体苏联人民的思想和愿望。他说：“如果美国总统艾森豪威尔先生有机会访问苏联，那我们会感到高兴。我认为，这样的访问对改善我们两国关系和巩固世界和平将有很大益处”。苏联公众十分满意地听到了赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将相互访问的消息。在不久的将来，当美国总统来到苏联的时候，他将有可能像我们所希望的那样亲眼看到，从事和平创造性劳动的全体苏联人民是和平的热情捍卫者，他们充满决心，要为消除
  “冷战”、为苏美关系正常化作出一切必要的努力。
    社论说，国际舆论认为，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间即将进行的相互访问是一件具有历史意义的事件，它不仅会对苏联和美国之间关系的进一步发展产生良好的影响，而且会有助于普遍和平。这就是为什么一切希望和平的人们这样热烈地欢迎两大国之间互派亲善使团，并认为相互访问是国际局势好转的吉兆。
    令人愉快的是，艾森豪威尔总统本人8月3日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上讲话时表示希望，即将同苏联政府首脑的交换意见将有助于融化苏美关系中的冰块。这种意见得到了所有普通的美国人、许多众议员和参议员，共和党人和民主党人的赞同。民主党领袖史蒂文森说：“我相信，苏联总理到美国的访问将会大大促进世界和平的巩固和两国之间关系的恢复。”
    社论说，关于赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间即将会见的消息，在世界大多数国家的首都和所有国家的人民中间受到了最热烈的欢迎。一切善良的人们认为这是理智、和平思想和和平共处政策的胜利。只有那些害怕加强和平和不希望国际局势正常化的人，才会对这个消息感到惊慌和悲伤。
    社论最后说，苏联人民、各国爱好和平的公众热烈地、真诚地相信，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间的相互访问将会有助于改善我们两个大国之间的互相谅解，并有助于普遍和平。
