Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, 4th: The preparatory meeting for the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs concluded late on the 3rd. The meeting passed a report and recommendations to be submitted to the official conference, which will begin on the 5th.

    The report believes that the nuclear armament of any region or country—including testing, supplying nuclear weapons, and transporting nuclear weapons into other countries—is not merely a matter of internal affairs, but a matter concerning all mankind. Therefore, the movement to ban nuclear weapons is undoubtedly closely linked to political issues. The primary task of the movement to ban nuclear weapons is to expose nuclear weapons policies used for political purposes, based on genuine humanitarian principles, until nuclear weapons and nuclear war are completely banned. The report calls for an immediate agreement to ban nuclear weapons testing and to prevent France from conducting nuclear explosion tests in the Sahara. The report opposes nuclear armament by Japan, West Germany, and France.

    The report calls for measures to prevent the strengthening of military blocs, as such blocs increase the risk of nuclear war. The report believes that transporting nuclear weapons into South Korea and South Vietnam will further expand the danger of nuclear war. The report advocates establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in order to steer the movement to ban nuclear weapons in the direction of eliminating military blocs as soon as possible.

    The report states that the planned revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will accelerate and strengthen Japan's nuclear armament, and foreign and Japanese representatives participating in the World Conference have expressed strong concern about this. In view of this danger, the representatives of various countries reached a consensus that it is necessary for the conference to discuss the issue of opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    The report advocates that countries artificially divided, such as Vietnam, Korea, and Germany, must achieve peaceful reunification. The report points out that Okinawa has been separated from the Japanese mainland and has become the largest atomic base in Asia.

    The report states that the national sovereignty of all countries must be respected, and friendly relations should also be established on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Therefore, the report suggests that the struggle of the Algerian people for independence should be supported by the people of other countries.

    The report points out that occupying the territory of other countries and using it to prepare for war is a violation of national sovereignty and increases the risk of nuclear war.

    The report suggests mobilizing public opinion to demand a summit meeting of major powers and to demand that the meeting achieve results; mobilizing public opinion against nuclear armament and further conclusion of military alliances.

    The report also suggests that the next World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs should still be held in Japan next year, which will be the fifteenth anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The report also suggests providing relief to atomic bomb victims.

    The meeting suggested that the World Conference issue a Hiroshima appeal to encourage the people of all countries to strive for survival, oppose nuclear armament of Japan and West Germany, and oppose nuclear tests in the Sahara.

    Dr. Pauling, the American representative who had just arrived in Hiroshima, said at the meeting: We expect to see the ongoing conference on the cessation of nuclear testing in Geneva achieve success. We believe that human love and sincerity will eliminate war, and we hope that mankind will have a brilliant future.

    Another American representative, Kelly, said that he felt ashamed of the U.S. killing the Japanese people with atomic bombs fourteen years ago. He also said that the following conditions are important in promoting world peace—eternal prohibition of nuclear weapons, reconciliation between East and West, universal disarmament, and improvement of relations between the United States and China.

    Representatives from Mongolia, Indonesia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Cambodia, the World Peace Council, the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom, and Shigeko Hara, an atomic bomb victim from Hiroshima City, spoke at the meeting, unanimously calling for a ban on nuclear weapons.

    The meeting ended with all the representatives singing the song banning atomic bombs. (Attached picture)

    禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会预备会议通过报告
    一定要完全禁止核武器和核战争
    据新华社4日讯　广岛消息：第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的预备会议在3日深夜结束，会上通过了向将从5日开始的正式大会提出的报告和建议。
    报告认为，任何地区和国家的核武装化——包括试验、供应核武器和把核武器运进他国，不仅是内政问题，而是关系到全人类的问题。因此，禁止核武器运动无疑是同政治问题紧密联系起来的。禁止核武器运动的首要任务是以真正的人道主义为原则，揭露用于政治目的的核武器政策，直到完全禁止核武器和核战争为止。报告要求立即达成禁止核武器试验的协议，阻止法国在撒哈拉举行核爆炸试验。报告反对日本、西德、法国进行核武装。
    报告要求采取措施，防止加强军事集团，因为这种集团增加核战争危险。报告认为，把核武器运进南朝鲜和南越将进一步扩大核战争的危险。报告主张建立无核武器地区，以便使禁止核武器运动向尽快消灭军事集团的方向发展。
    报告说，计划中的修改日美“安全条约”将加速和加强日本的核武装，参加世界大会的外国和日本代表对此都表示了强烈的不安。鉴于这种危险，各国代表取得了一致意见，认为大会讨论反对修改日美“安全条约”问题是需要的。
    报告主张越南、朝鲜、德国等被人为地分裂的国家，必须实现和平统一。报告指出，冲绳已经从日本本土分裂出去，并且已经成为亚洲最大的原子基地。
    报告说，各国人民的国家主权必须得到尊重，并且也应该在平等和互相尊重的基础上建立友好关系。因此，报告建议阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争应该获得其他国家人民的支持。
    报告指出，占领其他国家的领土，并且利用来准备战争，是对国家主权的侵犯，并增加了核战争的危险。
    报告建议，动员舆论要求举行大国首脑会谈，并且要求会谈取得成果；动员舆论反对核武装和进一步缔结军事联盟。
    报告还建议下一届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会明年仍在日本举行，明年是美国用原子弹轰炸广岛和长崎十五周年。报告并且建议救济原子弹受害者。
    会议建议世界大会发表一项广岛呼吁书，鼓励各国人民为争取生存进行努力，反对日本和西德核武装，反对在撒哈拉举行核试验。
    刚刚赶到广岛的美国代表保林博士在会上说：我们期望看到正在日内瓦举行的停止核试验会议能够获得成功。我们相信人类的爱和诚意将会消灭战争，并且期望人类能够获得辉煌的将来。
    另外一位美国代表凯利说，他对于十四年前美国用原子弹杀害日本人民的行为感到羞耻。他又说，在促进世界和平的条件中，以下的几个条件是重要的——永远禁止核武器、东西方和解、普遍裁军、改善美国和中国的关系。
    蒙古、印度尼西亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、柬埔寨和世界和平理事会，国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟代表以及广岛市的原子弹受害者原茂子等都在会上讲话，一致要求禁止核武器。
    会议在全体代表高唱禁止原子弹的歌声中结束。（附图片）
