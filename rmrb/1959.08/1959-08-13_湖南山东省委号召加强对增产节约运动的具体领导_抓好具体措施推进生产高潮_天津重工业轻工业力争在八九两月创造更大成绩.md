　　Changsha, August 12th (from our newspaper) - Party committees at all levels in Hunan are analyzing the current favorable situation, educating Party members and cadres to boost their energy, overcome right-leaning sentiments, seize the opportune moment, and launch a high tide of increasing production and practicing economy.

　　After the Hunan Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference with prefectural and municipal Party secretaries on the evening of the 5th, it issued a notice to Party committees at all levels regarding the study of the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy." Local and municipal Party committees immediately convened county Party secretary meetings or telephone conferences to deploy work for August and September. The Provincial Party Committee also dispatched some responsible comrades to various locations to assist in the work. On the evening of the 10th, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly held a radio rally to mobilize all workers in the province.

　　The current situation in Hunan is very good. In agriculture, an abundant harvest of early rice was achieved. Although late rice was under severe threat from drought, 12 million mu were still planted in time, and mid-season rice has also begun to be harvested. In industry, the total industrial output value from January to July increased by 72.4% compared to the same period last year. Fifty-seven of the 59 major products increased compared to the same period last year, with 11 products increasing tenfold. The quality of industrial products has significantly improved; for example, the qualified rate of pig iron in mid-July increased from 69% in June to 88%. The commercial sector has also made great achievements in organizing supply, supporting the production of non-staple foods, and arranging markets. However, right-leaning sentiments and a slackening of effort have begun to emerge among a small number of cadres. The Hunan Provincial Party Committee believes that although this ideology is held by a minority or individuals, allowing it to develop further would be serious and must be resolutely overcome.

　　August and September are the crucial period for completing the annual production plan. The Provincial Party Committee calls on Party committees at all levels to widely and deeply mobilize the masses to work hard, practically, and cleverly, to further launch a greater high tide of increasing production and practicing economy. On the agricultural front, the focus should be on drought resistance, expanding the autumn planting area, and striving to complete and over fulfill the grain production plan, to achieve an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture. On the industrial front, efforts should be made to complete the third quarter production tasks.

　　In order to ensure the completion of the tasks for August and September, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the first secretaries of county Party committees should go to the areas most severely affected by the current drought to guide the work. Leading personnel on the industrial front at all levels should also go to the most critical production areas to provide specific guidance. All localities should insert red flags and carry out competitions, promote advanced experiences, and promote the continued all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

　　Jinan, August 12th (from our newspaper) - Immediately mobilize, check and overcome right-leaning slackening sentiments, boost energy, and in the cities, quickly launch an even greater high tide of increasing production and practicing economy; in the countryside, fully mobilize the masses to further carry out the drought resistance movement, ensure the realization of overproduction tasks, and use brilliant leap forward achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day. This is the battle call issued by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee to Party organizations at all levels and all Party members throughout the province on the 9th.

　　Since entering 1959, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Shandong Province have continued to work hard, practically, and cleverly, achieving great achievements on all fronts and forming a situation of continued great leap forward. However, among a small number of cadres, right-leaning sentiments of fear of difficulty and slackening of effort are rising, and have become the main danger in current work. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee requires Party organizations at all levels to seize August and September, boost energy, resolutely oppose right-leaning slackening sentiments, vigorously increase production and practice economy, improve quality, reduce costs, and comprehensively arrange and save on the use of labor, materials, and financial resources. The Provincial Party Committee held an industrial secretary meeting in the eastern region in Qingdao on the 10th, and put forward eight measures for the industrial front to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement.

　　In order to check and overcome right-leaning slackening sentiments among cadres and in Party organizations at all levels, so that cadres and masses can boost their energy on the basis of seeking truth from facts and achieving consensus, and comprehensively launch a greater high tide of mass increase production and practice economy movement, the Provincial Party Committee has notified Party organizations at all levels and all departments to immediately organize cadres and masses to deeply study and discuss the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy." All localities are required to put forward specific measures for comprehensively launching a mass high tide of increasing production and practicing economy and a high tide of drought resistance movement based on the situation in their own regions and departments, and vigorously implement them.

　　Tianjin, August 12th (from our newspaper) - The vast number of workers in factories and enterprises in Tianjin are widely carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, determined to seize August and September and create outstanding achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.

　　Since August, many factories in Tianjin have convened worker representative conferences. After summarizing the production experience of July and criticizing right-leaning slackening thoughts among a small number of cadres, they revised the production plans for the third quarter and August. In order to strive for daily red and red full moon in August and September, Party and government leaders of many enterprises have gone deep into groups and work sections to direct production and effectively strengthen the leadership of the front line. The enthusiasm of the city's 40,000 steel workers has been increasingly boosted. On the basis of overfulfilling the production plan for July, they are advancing victoriously. Steel production in the first ten days of August increased by more than 4,200 tons compared with the first ten days of July, and the qualified rate of steel increased from 95.69% in July to 96.97%, among which the first-class product rate also increased from 88.74% to 91.79%. Workers in the machinery industry and light industry systems have also made outstanding achievements in the increase production and practice economy movement. Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Factory completed the July production plan five days ahead of schedule, striving for a 30% increase in August compared with July, and completed the production plan for the first ten days of August one day ahead of schedule. After overcoming fear of difficulties, the eight paper mills including Xinhua, Guanghua, and Xinghua, originally believed that the plan for the third quarter could not be completed, but now they are determined to strive to increase the production of various types of paper by more than 2,000 tons on the basis of completing the plan. The vast number of workers in the textile industry system exceeded the output value plan for the first ten days of August by 1.17%, and the quality also improved significantly. Under the encouragement of the slogan "Work practically and cleverly for eighty days, strive for the lead in various indicators, and welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day," the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has launched a high tide of "short-distance" competition since August 1. Workers throughout the factory visit and learn from each other in the competition, further improving their operating methods and improving the quality of cotton cloth. From August 1st to 5th, cotton cloth production exceeded by 3.04%, and the quality (according to the standard product rate) reached 99.55%.

　　The mass technological innovation and technological revolution is the central content of the increase production and practice economy movement in Tianjin's industrial sector. Since the beginning of this year, workers in various factories throughout the city have put forward hundreds of thousands of innovation suggestions targeting key problems and weak links in production, of which more than 300,000 have been implemented, effectively promoting the development of production. In order to grasp the production in August and September, factories have further strengthened the leadership of the technological innovation movement since entering August, and especially emphasized carrying out mass scientific and technological research activities. Now, mass scientific research organizations combined with the professional research institutions of various industrial bureaus have been established in most factories. Many factories have established "three-way combination scientific research institutes," adopting the "three-way combination" method of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to carry out scientific and technological research activities.

　　湖南山东省委号召加强对增产节约运动的具体领导
　　抓好具体措施推进生产高潮
　　天津重工业轻工业力争在八九两月创造更大成绩
    本报长沙12日电　湖南各级党委正在分析当前有利形势，教育党员和干部鼓足干劲，克服右倾情绪，抓紧大好时机，掀起增产节约的热潮。
    中共湖南省委5日晚召开地、市委书记电话会议以后，向各级党委发出了关于学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”社论的通知。各地、市委立即召开了县委书记会议或电话会议，部署了8、9月份工作。省委还派了一些负责同志分赴各地协助工作。10日晚，湖南省委和人委又联合举行广播大会，向全省职工进行了动员。
    湖南省当前的形势很好。在农业方面，早稻获得了大丰收，晚稻虽在旱灾严重威胁下，仍然及时插上了一千二百万亩，中稻也已开始收割。在工业方面，1至7月的工业生产总值比去年同期增长72.4％，五十九种主要产品有五十七种比去年同时增产，其中有十一种产品增长了十倍。工业产品的质量显著提高，例如7月中旬的生铁合格率由6月份的69％提高到88％。商业部门在组织货源，扶植副食品生产，安排市场等方面，也取得了很大成绩。但在一小部分干部中右倾情绪和松劲思想却有所抬头。湖南省委认为这种思想情绪虽然是少数的或个别的，但让它发展下去却是严重的，因此必须坚决克服。
    8、9两个月是完成全年生产计划的关键时期，省委号召各级党委广泛深入发动群众苦干实干巧干，进一步掀起增产节约更大的热潮。在农业战线上，要以抗旱为中心，扩大秋种面积，力争完成和超额完成粮食生产计划，实现农业全面大丰收。在工业战线上，要力争完成三季度生产任务。
    为了保证完成8、9两月的任务，省委指出县委第一书记要到当前干旱最严重的地方去指导工作。工业战线上的各级领导人员也要深入到生产最紧要的地方去，具体指导生产。各地要大插红旗，开展竞赛，推广先进经验，促使工农业生产继续全面跃进。
    本报济南12日电　立即动员起来，检查和克服右倾松劲情绪，鼓足干劲，在城市，迅速掀起增产节约的更大高潮；在农村，要充分地发动群众进一步开展抗旱运动，保证实现超产任务，用光辉跃进的成就，迎接国庆十周年。这是中共山东省委于9日向全省各级党组织和全体党员发出的战斗号召。
    进入1959年以来，山东全省人民在党的领导下，继续大干苦干巧干，在各个战线上取得了很大的成绩，形成了一个继续大跃进的形势。但是，在一小部分干部中，畏难和松劲的右倾情绪正在抬头，且已成为当前工作中的主要危险。因此，省委要求各级党组织必须抓紧8、9两个月，鼓足干劲，坚决反对右倾松劲情绪，厉行增产节约、提高质量、降低成本，全面安排和节约使用劳动力、物力和财力。省委10日在青岛举行了东部地区工业书记会议，提出了工业战线开展增产节约运动的八项措施。
    为了在干部中，在各级党的组织中，对右倾松劲情绪，加以检查和克服，使干部和群众在实事求是和认识一致的基础上鼓足干劲，全面地掀起群众性的增产节约运动更大高潮，省委已通知各级党组织和各部门，立即组织干部群众，深入地学习和讨论人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论。要求各地根据本地区、本部门的情况，提出全面地掀起群众性的增产节约高潮和抗旱运动高潮的具体措施，大力贯彻执行。
    本报天津12日电　天津市各工厂企业广大职工广泛开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，决心大抓8、9月，创造优异的成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    8月份以来，天津市很多工厂都召开了职工代表大会，在总结7月份生产经验，批判了少数干部中右倾松劲思想后，修订了第三季度和8月份的生产计划。为了力争8、9月份日日红、红满月，许多企业的党、政领导干部深入到小组、工段指挥生产，切实加强了第一线的领导。全市四万名钢铁工人的干劲越鼓越足，在超额完成7月份生产计划的基础上乘胜前进，8月上旬的钢产量比7月上旬增长了四千二百多吨，钢的合格率由7月份的95.69％上升到96.97％，其中一级品率也由88.74％上升到91.79％。机械工业和轻工业系统的职工在增产节约的运动中，也都作出了出色的成绩。天津农业机械厂提前五天完成7月份生产计划，力争8月份比7月份增长30％，并且提前一天完成8月上旬生产计划。新华、光华、兴华等八个造纸厂克服畏难情绪后，原来认为第三季度完不成计划，现在决心力争在完成计划的基础上增产各种纸张两千多吨。纺织工业系统的广大职工，8月上旬超额1.17％完成了产值计划，质量也有显著提高。国营天津第一棉纺织厂在“实干、巧干八十天，各项指标力争先，迎接国庆十周年”的口号鼓舞下，从8月1日起，掀起了“短距离”竞赛的高潮，全厂职工在竞赛中互相参观学习，进一步改进了操作方法，提高了棉布质量。8月1日到5日，棉布产量超额3.04％，质量（按标准品率）达到99.55％。
    群众性的技术革新和技术革命是天津市工业部门增产节约运动的中心内容。今年以来全市各厂职工针对生产中存在的关键问题和薄弱环节，先后提出了数十万件革新建议，其中已经实现了三十多万件，有效地促进了生产的发展。为了抓好8、9月份的生产，各厂在进入8月份以后又进一步加强了对技术革新运动的领导，并且特别强调开展群众性的科学技术研究活动。现在，同各工业局的专业性研究机构相结合的群众性的科学研究组织，已在大部分工厂中建立起来。许多工厂都已成立了“三结合科学研究所”，采用领导干部、工人群众和技术人员“三结合”的方法，开展科学技术研究活动。
