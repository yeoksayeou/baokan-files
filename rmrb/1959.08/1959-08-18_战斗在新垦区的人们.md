　　People Fighting in the New Reclamation Area
　　(Our dispatch) These days, while good news of harvests from places like Ukraine, Kuibyshev, Tula, and Ryazan is frequently reaching Moscow, people in the new reclamation areas of the Soviet Union's east are fighting day and night in the wheat fields. The vast new reclamation area is already producing grain for the sixth time. This year, a bumper harvest is expected, and it is estimated that grain production there will be even greater than last year's bumper harvest.
　　After reclaiming a large amount of wasteland, the Soviet people did not stop moving forward. In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the people's enthusiasm for supporting the new reclamation areas continued to rise. In just the past few months, another 30,000 young people from all over the Soviet Union have left their warm and comfortable homes and gone to the new reclamation areas for long-term work. During this busy harvest season, trains loaded with people and machines are continuously rushing there. Agricultural colleges across the country have sent 18,000 senior students to drive harvesters. 55,000 students from various agricultural technical schools have also joined the battle. Tens of thousands of skilled mechanics and harvester operators have come from areas where harvesting has been completed.
　　Work in the new reclamation areas is very heavy, and storms strike from time to time. Just in August, the temperature in some places dropped to two degrees Celsius, and in September it often falls below zero. The harsh climate has not intimidated the people on the wasteland. The socialist emulation campaign launched to accelerate the harvest is in full swing. In order to save time, young men and women are driving open tractors, braving wind and rain day and night in the fields, striving to harvest 25-30 hectares of grain every day. On the eve of the harvest, advanced production team leaders in the new reclamation areas also learned from the example of Gaganova and went to work in backward and troubled production teams, because they knew that every moment is precious during the harvest season, and turning backward teams into advanced ones can speed up the harvest and harvest more grain for the country. Even retired harvester operators are "returning to the front lines" these days to compete with young people. Many advanced harvester operators have proposed the task of taking on apprentices.
　　New people are growing up in the new reclamation areas. Last year, the land cultivated by the Sosov Production Team suffered a severe drought. However, they were not discouraged, and they no longer waited for rain from heaven. As early as last winter and this spring, they prepared sufficient snow reserves. They not only plowed all the boundless land, but also completed the sowing task in four days under the most appropriate climatic conditions, and then carried out two cultivations. In this way, the unyielding people, not relying on the weather, obtained this year's bumper harvest with hard work.
　　Five years ago, Sasha, an eighteen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, traveled from Tallinn, in the northwest corner of the Soviet Union, to the new reclamation area. The difficult conditions of the wasteland tempered him, and he became a production team leader. This spring, this twenty-three-year-old young man was appointed as the manager of a large state-owned farm. (Attached picture)

### 战斗在新垦区的人们

　　战斗在新垦区的人们
    本报讯　这几天，当乌克兰、古比雪夫、图拉和梁赞等地的丰收捷报频频传到莫斯科的时候，在苏联东部新垦区，人们正日夜在麦海中奋战。一望无际的新垦区，已经是第六次出产粮食了。今年，丰收在望，据估计，那里粮食产量将比丰收的去年还要多。
    苏联人民在开垦了大量荒地以后，并没有停止不动。在七年计划的第一年，人们支援新垦区的热情继续上涨。就在最近这几个月内，全苏各地又有三万名青年离开了温暖和舒适的家庭，跑到新垦区长期工作。在这收割的繁忙季节里，载满人和机器的列车络绎不绝地驰向那里。各地农业学院派出了一万八千名高班生去驾驶收割机。各地农业技术学校的五万五千名学生也已投入了战斗。从收割完毕的地区去了数万名熟练的机械师和收割机手。
    新垦区的工作是十分繁重的、狂风暴雨时刻袭击。就在8月里，有的地方气温下降到摄氏二度，而到9月往往要到零度以下。恶劣的气候并没有吓倒荒地上的人们。为加速收割而展开的社会主义竞赛搞得热火朝天。为了争取时间，小伙子和姑娘们驾驶着无篷的拖拉机，风雨无阻地日夜奔驰在田野上，为每日收割二十五——三十公顷粮食而奋斗。在收割前夕，新垦区先进的生产队长们也学习了加干诺娃的榜样，纷纷到落后的和有困难的生产队去工作，因为他们知道，在收割季节一刻值千金，使落后的队变为先进的，就能加快收割速度，为国家收打更多的粮食。甚至退休的老收割机手，这些日子也“重上前线”，同年轻人较量一番。很多先进的收割机手提出了带徒弟的任务。
    新人在新垦区上成长起来了。去年，索索夫生产队耕作的地段遭到了大旱灾。但是，他们没有气馁，他们不再等待老天下雨。早在去冬今春，他们就准备好了充足的积雪。他们不仅把无边无际的土地全部翻耕了，而且在最适当的气候条件下用四天的时间完成了播种任务，而后又进行了两次耕作。就这样，不屈的人们，不靠天时，用辛勤的劳动获得了今年的丰收。
    五年前，十八岁的共青团员萨沙，从苏联西北角的塔林，跋山涉水来到新垦区。荒地的困难条件锻炼了他，他当了生产队长。今年春天，这个二十三岁的青年被任命为一个大型国营农场的经理。（附图片）
