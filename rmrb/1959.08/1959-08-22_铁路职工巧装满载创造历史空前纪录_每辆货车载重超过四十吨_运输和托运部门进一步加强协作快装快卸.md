Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: Railway workers across the country are doing everything possible to skillfully load to capacity and quickly load and unload, tapping the potential of railway transportation. Since August, new achievements have been made. In the first ten days of August, the average load of goods per freight car nationwide reached 39.9 tons, creating the highest record this year; from the 10th to the 19th, it continued to rise to 40.1 tons. This is a record never before seen in the history of railway transportation in our country.

Quick loading and unloading is one of the important ways for railway departments to accelerate vehicle turnover, tap existing transportation potential, and support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the second half of the year. According to calculations, if the load capacity of each freight car is increased by half a ton from the current level, the existing freight cars nationwide can transport tens of thousands of tons of goods more each month; if the time for each freight car turnover is shortened by 0.01 days compared to the plan, two or three million tons of goods can be transported more throughout the year. The potential is very considerable.

In order to skillfully load to capacity, the Ministry of Railways decided to strengthen the loading of freight cars in early June. Since then, railway workers in various places have created many methods of skillfully loading to capacity, giving full play to the loading capacity of freight cars. The Shanghai Railway Bureau established sixty full-load working groups, launching a mass movement of skillfully loading to capacity within the entire bureau. From January to July, the average load of each freight car increased by four tons compared to the same period last year. The Jinzhou Railway Bureau determined the principle of "matching cars according to goods," organizing large vehicles to transport heavy goods such as coal, salt, and cement, and using low-side cars to transport materials such as ore and mineral building materials, giving play to the unique performance of different vehicles. Relevant departments of this bureau also hold regular meetings every day to analyze and check loading work, and immediately take improvement measures once problems are discovered. Therefore, it reversed the poor loading situation in the first half of the year, and since August, it has created the best performance among railway bureaus nationwide.

In the movement to skillfully load more, the Jinan, Shanghai, Shenyang, Zhengzhou, Changsha, and Xi'an bureaus further developed incidental transportation. By July, more than 4 million tons of materials had been transported incidentally nationwide. The goods transported incidentally were originally limited to the scope of a railway bureau, but now incidental transportation can also be carried out between bureaus.

Railway bureaus in various places have also widely promoted the experience of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company and the Fuxin Mining Bureau in cooperating with local railway departments for transportation, promoting a style of vigorous cooperation, and powerfully promoting the work of quick loading and unloading. The Wuhan Railway Bureau learned from the experience of cooperation between the Benxi City Railway and the steel plant. In July, it organized a working group to Wuhan Iron and Steel Company to carry out transportation cooperation, organizing the coking coal transported from the north-south trunk line to Wugang into a fast operation train directly to the factory area, thus accelerating the loading and unloading operation time by half. Recently, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications summarized the experience of mutual cooperation between Qinhuangdao Seaport and local railway departments to accelerate loading and unloading operations, and prepared to promote it in ports across the country that are connected to railways. The Ministry of Railways is also further strengthening the transportation organization work of stations, shortening loading and unloading time and vehicle transfer time.

In order to improve loading and unloading efficiency, railway transportation units in various places have carried out a technological innovation movement to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, and have built high platforms and low cargo positions in places where conditions permit, which can significantly improve loading and unloading efficiency. According to incomplete statistics from the Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Jinzhou railway bureaus, more than 200 pairs of booms and more than 200 conveyors have been newly added. The total length of high platforms and low cargo positions that have been built across the country has reached more than 60 kilometers each. Many stations have created new loading methods and packaging methods. For example, the staff of Jining Station of the Hohhot Railway Bureau created seventeen advanced loading methods, increasing the efficiency of cargo loading by one to three times.

    铁路职工巧装满载创造历史空前纪录
    每辆货车载重超过四十吨
    运输和托运部门进一步加强协作快装快卸
    新华社21日讯　全国铁路职工千方百计地巧装满载、快装快卸，挖掘铁路运输潜力，8月份以来，取得了新的成绩。上旬全国每辆货车平均装载的货物达到三十九点九吨，创造了今年以来的最高纪录；从10日到19日，继续上升到了四十点一吨。这是我国铁路运输史上所从来没有过的纪录。
    快装快卸，是铁路部门加速车辆周转、挖掘现有运输潜力，支援工农业生产在下半年继续跃进的重要途径之一。据计算，如果把每辆货车的载重量从现在水平上提高半吨，全国现有货车，每月就能够多运数十万吨货物；每辆货车周转一次的时间，比计划缩短零点零一天，全年就能多运二、三百万吨货物。潜力是很可观的。
    为了巧装满载，铁道部在6月初就决定加强货车的装载工作。从那时以后，各地铁路职工创造了不少巧装满载的方法，充分发挥货车的装载力。上海铁路局成立了六十个满载工作小组，在全局范围内掀起了一个群众性的巧装满载运动，1月到7月，每辆货车的平均装载量比去年同期增加了四吨。锦州铁路局确定了“按货配车”的原则，组织大型车辆装运煤、盐、水泥等重质货物，用低边车装运矿石、矿物性建筑材料等物资，发挥了不同车辆的特有性能。这个局有关部门每天还定时开碰头会，分析检查装载工作，一经发现问题，立即采取改进的措施。因此扭转了上半年装载工作较差的局面，8月份以来，在全国铁路局中创造了最优良的成绩。
    在巧装多载运动中，济南、上海、沈阳、郑州、长沙、西安等局进一步开展了捎脚运输。到7月为止，全国捎脚运输的物资已达四百多万吨。捎脚运输的货物，原来只局限在一个铁路局的范围以内，现在局与局之间也可以捎脚了。
    各地铁路局还普遍推广本溪钢铁公司和阜新矿务局同当地铁路部门协作搞运输的经验，大兴协作之风，有力地推动了快装快卸的工作。武汉铁路局学习了本溪市铁路和钢厂协作的经验，7月份组织工作组到武汉钢铁公司展开运输协作，把由南北干线运往武钢的焦煤，组织为直通厂区的快速作业列车，因而把装卸作业时间加快了一半。最近铁道部和交通部又总结了秦皇岛海港同当地铁路部门互相协作、加速装卸作业的经验，准备在全国和铁路衔接的港口中推广。铁道部还在进一步加强车站的运输组织工作，缩短装卸时间和车辆中转时间。
    为了提高装卸效率，各地铁路运输单位开展了为实现装卸机械化、半机械化的技术革新运动，并且在有条件的地方修建能够显著提高装卸效率的高站台、低货位。据北京、上海、沈阳、锦州等铁路局的不完全统计，新近增加了二百多副吊杆，二百多台输送机。全国各地已经修筑的高站台和低货位，总长度各达六十多公里。许多车站创造了新的装载方法和包装方法。如呼和浩特铁路局集宁车站的职工群众，创造了十七种先进装载方法，把货物装载效率提高了一倍到三倍。
