Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 10th: Soviet Premier Khrushchev wrote in a letter to the leaders of the European Committee Against Nuclear Armament that the Soviet Union is willing to undertake the most solemn obligation not to be the first to conduct any nuclear weapons tests.

The leaders of the European Committee Against Nuclear Armament wrote to Khrushchev on June 29th, requesting the Soviet government not to be the first to resume experimental nuclear explosions. The letter stated that they had also made the same request to the governments of the United States and Britain.

Khrushchev replied on August 5th, stating that the Soviet Union had unilaterally ceased all tests of atomic and hydrogen weapons on March 31, 1958, and hoped that the United States and Britain would follow the Soviet Union's example. However, the governments of the United States and Britain not only failed to do so, but also attempted to take advantage of the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of testing to obtain the maximum military advantage, conducting a series of nuclear tests with unprecedented frequency. Khrushchev continued, "Regrettably, I see no reason to believe that the Western countries will be more sincere this time and willing to end the experimental explosions of nuclear weapons." Our concerns can be demonstrated by the fact that although the negotiations in Geneva on the cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons have been going on for nearly a year, whether the negotiations will succeed remains a question due to the negative attitude adopted by the United States and Britain.

Khrushchev said, "I can assure you that the Soviet Union advocates the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear tests. The Soviet Union believes that this can serve as the first step towards achieving the ultimate goal - the complete cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, the elimination of such weapons from the arsenals of all countries, and the destruction of all existing stockpiles of these weapons."

    赫鲁晓夫复函欧洲反对核军备委员会领导人
　　苏联愿承担义务不先恢复核试验
　　看不出西方国家有结束核武器试验的诚意
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在给欧洲反对核军备委员会领导人的信中写道，苏联愿意承担不首先进行任何核武器试验的最庄严的义务。
    欧洲反对核军备委员会领导人6月29日曾写信给赫鲁晓夫，请求苏联政府不要第一个恢复试验性核爆炸，信中说，他们也向美英两国政府提出了同样的请求。
    赫鲁晓夫在8月5日回信说，苏联在1958年3月31日就曾经单方面停止原子武器和氢武器的一切试验，同时希望美英两国也能效法苏联的榜样。可是，美英两国政府不仅没有这样做，反而企图利用苏联单方面停止试验的机会来取得最大限度的军事优势，它们空前频繁地进行了一系列的核试验。赫鲁晓夫继续写道，很遗憾，我看不出有什么理由可以认为，西方国家这次会有更大的诚意，愿意结束核武器的试验性爆炸。我们的担心可以从下面这一点得到证明：虽然在日内瓦进行的关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的谈判已经持续了将近一年，但是，由于美英两国采取否定的态度，谈判能否成功仍然是个问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我可以向你们保证，苏联主张立即、永远停止核试验，苏联认为这可作为达到最终目标——完全停止原子武器和氢武器试验，从各国军备中取消这种武器、销毁这种武器现有的一切储备——的第一步。
