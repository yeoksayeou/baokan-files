Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Guizhou Province's mountainous areas, with over 3.2 million mu of mature tung oil trees and over 1.8 million mu of mature oil tea plants, are generally bearing abundant fruit, promising a bumper harvest.

　　This year, various areas in the mountainous regions of Guizhou have focused closely on the production of tung oil and oil tea. Starting from February and March, people's communes in various areas organized manpower to go up the mountains to cultivate and foster tung oil trees and oil tea plants. Up to now, the province has fostered over 2 million mu of tung oil trees and cultivated over 300,000 mu of oil tea plants. In order to strive for a triple harvest of tung oil, oil tea, and grain, the communes in Yanhe County have universally promoted the experience of intercropping forests and grains. In some areas of Songtao Miao Autonomous County, where looper caterpillars were found to be harming tung oil trees, over 9,000 people were immediately organized to make a concentrated effort to catch the caterpillars and spray pesticides, and the pest damage was controlled within a few days. Recently, when arranging autumn harvest preparation work, people's communes in various areas also arranged for the harvesting of tung oil seeds and oil tea seeds, planning to organize a portion of women, elderly people, and children to go up the mountains to pick tung oil seeds and oil tea seeds, striving to achieve a bumper harvest.

　　Tung oil extracted from tung oil seeds is an important industrial oil and also an export commodity. Tea oil extracted from oil tea seeds has a fragrant aroma and is a relatively good edible vegetable oil. In recent years, the production of tea oil in Guizhou Province has continuously increased, playing an important role in meeting the growing needs of the masses for edible oil. The area of tung oil and oil tea in the mountainous areas of Guizhou accounts for about 15% of the province's forest area, with the Tongren Special District having the largest area. Before liberation, due to the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, tung oil trees and oil tea plants throughout the province were almost completely devastated. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, people of all ethnic groups have actively cultivated and fostered them year after year, and have also cultivated over 10 million mu of young forests, which has become an important sideline income for farmers in the mountainous areas of Guizhou.

　　贵州积极抚育油桐和油茶
    新华社讯　贵州省山区的三百二十多万亩成林油桐和一百八十多万亩成林油茶，普遍结实累累，丰收在望。
    今年贵州山区各地对油桐、油茶生产抓得较紧。从2、3月份起，各地人民公社就组织人力，上山垦复和抚育油桐、油茶。到目前为止，全省已抚育油桐二百多万亩，垦复油茶三十多万亩。沿河县各公社为了争取油桐、油茶、粮食三丰收，都普遍推广了林粮混作的经验。松桃苗族自治县部分地区发现尺蠖危害油桐，马上组织了九千多人突击捕捉和喷射药剂，几天内就制止了虫害。各地人民公社最近在安排秋收准备工作时，也安排了油桐子和油茶子的收获准备工作，计划组织一部分妇女、老年人和少年儿童，上山拣油桐子和油茶子，争取做到丰产丰收。
    油桐子榨出的桐油，是重要的工业用油，也是出口物资。油茶子榨出的茶油，气味芬芳，是一种较好的食用植物油，几年来，贵州省茶油不断增产，对适应群众在食油方面不断增长的需要起了重要作用。贵州山区油桐油茶面积约占全省森林面积的15％左右，其中以铜仁专区最多。解放以前，由于国民党反动政府的摧残，全省油桐油茶荒芜殆尽。解放后，在党和人民政府的领导下，各族人民连年积极地垦复和抚育，并且营造了一千多万亩幼林，已成为贵州山区农民的一项重要的副业收入。
