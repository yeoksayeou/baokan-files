    Longhekou Reservoir Under Construction (Photo)
    The Longhekou Reservoir in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, has already begun construction. This reservoir is located at the confluence of the Hangbu River and the Wusha River and is one of the main projects of the Shi-Pi-Hang irrigation project. The top of the dam is 71 meters high, and the total reservoir capacity reaches 570 million cubic meters. The entire project is expected to be completed in 1960. After the reservoir is completed, it can irrigate 1.75 million mu of farmland; a power station with an installed capacity of 3,000 to 5,000 kilowatts can be built; the two irrigation canals downstream can accommodate ships of 100 to 500 tons, connecting to the Shi River and the Pi River to the north, and to Lujiang to the south.
    Currently, more than 40,000 workers from 23 communes in Shucheng County are vigorously carrying out tool innovations, striving to improve work efficiency, and striving to complete the main dam project after National Day.

    建设中的龙河口水库（图片）
    安徽省舒城县龙河口水库已经动工兴建。这个水库位于杭埠河、乌沙河汇流处，是史淠杭航灌工程中的主要工程之一。坝顶高程七十一米，总库容量达五亿七千万公方。全部工程预计在1960年完成。这个水库建成后，能灌溉一百七十五万亩农田；可建一座装机容量为三千至五千瓩的电站；下游的两条灌溉干流，可通一百吨至五百吨的船只，向北可通史河、淠河，向南可通庐江。
    目前，舒城县二十三个公社的四万多民工正在大搞工具革新，努力提高工效，争取在国庆以后完成主坝工程。
