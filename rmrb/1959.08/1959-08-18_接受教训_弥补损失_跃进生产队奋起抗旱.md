Chengdu, August 17th -- The Yuejin Production Team of Lailong Commune in Luxian County, Sichuan Province, learned a lesson from their experience during the early rice production period, when they did not pay enough attention to fighting natural disasters, resulting in a reduction of several thousand catties of grain. Under the current severe drought conditions, they are fighting hard and seizing grain from the sky. On the one hand, they are rushing to transplant late rice, and on the other hand, they are irrigating fields to protect seedlings, and are doing everything possible to strengthen field management, striving to recover the grain lost due to the early rice shortfall and the drought from the autumn fields.

This production team encountered drought after the early rice harvest. The local rainfall in July was only 30 millimeters, while the required rainfall was about 270 millimeters. Many paddy fields in the team were so dry that they could not be plowed and transplanted for a time; many of the late rice fields that had already been transplanted also experienced soil cracking and seedling wilting. Among the dryland crops, one-third of the sweet potato seedlings died, and other crops such as cotton, peanuts, and sesame were also urgently in need of rain. The cadres of this production team, through the example of the team's failure to pay attention to disaster prevention and drought resistance during the early rice sowing stage this year, which led to a reduction in grain yield, carried out ideological education of "man will conquer nature" among the commune members, calling on everyone not to rely on the sky or wait for rain, but to fight drought and rush to transplant, fight drought and protect seedlings, and immediately take action. With the cooperation and support of the fraternal teams, dozens of waterwheels installed in various reservoirs and ponds were used day and night to draw water and irrigate the fields, ensuring the smooth progress of plowing and transplanting. In just over ten days, they transplanted late rice on 85% of the early rice fields, and then universally irrigated all the late rice fields that could be irrigated with waterwheels. For the late rice fields that could not be irrigated with waterwheels, they used the method of weeding seedlings in advance to enhance the drought resistance of the seedlings. For the sweet potato fields where seedlings had died and were missing, they mobilized manpower to rush to replant sweet potato seedlings. Now the replanted sweet potato seedlings have mostly survived.

While rushing to transplant late rice and protect seedlings, this production team also took many effective drought-resistant measures. For example, for some terraced fields that really had no water to draw and could not be transplanted, they resolutely changed to planting sweet potatoes. According to calculations, these fields can basically make up for the loss of not planting late rice after changing to sweet potatoes. A few low-lying fields have dried up to the point where they cannot be dug up and replanted, so it was decided to leave the early rice stubble to cultivate ratooning rice. As long as these ratooning rice are carefully managed with topdressing and other management work, each mu can produce more than 100 catties of rice. In addition, the team also allocated all the field edges and corners to the commune members, allowing them to use their spare time to increase grain planting, so that each person can harvest 200 catties more grain in the autumn, which can make up for part of the losses caused by the drought.

After preliminary calculations, the drought has caused this production team to lose about 30,000 to 40,000 catties of grain. However, the commune members firmly believe that as long as the measures of increasing planting, replanting, and strengthening field management are closely combined with rushing to transplant and protecting seedlings, not only can the grain lost due to the drought be made up for, but even the several thousand catties of grain lost in the early rice can be recovered. At present, they are seizing the time to carry out field management of late rice and sweet potatoes, and preparing for the planting of late autumn crops. (Attached picture)

### 接受教训　弥补损失　跃进生产队奋起抗旱

　　接受教训　弥补损失
　　跃进生产队奋起抗旱
    本报成都17日电　四川泸县来龙公社跃进生产队吸取早稻生产期间不注意向自然灾害作斗争，以致少收几千斤粮食的经验教训，在当前的严重旱象下，奋起苦战，与天争粮。他们一面抢插晚稻，一面灌田保苗，并千方百计地加强田间管理，力争把早稻歉收和被旱灾夺去的粮食从秋田中夺取回来。
    这个生产队在早稻收割之后就遇上了旱象。当地7月份仅降雨三十毫米，而需雨量却在二百七十毫米左右。队上的许多水田，曾因为过于干涸，一度无法翻犁插秧；已经插秧的晚稻田，也有不少发生泥土开裂、禾苗枯萎的现象。在旱地作物中，红薯苗枯死了三分之一，其他如棉花、花生、芝麻等也迫切望雨。这个生产队的干部，通过本队今年在早稻播种阶段不注意防灾抗灾以致少收粮食的事例，对社员进行了“人定胜天”的思想教育，号召大家不靠天，不等雨，抗旱抢插，抗旱保苗，并立即行动起来。在各兄弟队的协作支援下，分别装置在各个水库和塘堰上的几十部水车昼夜不停地车水灌田、保证了翻犁、插秧工作的顺利进行。仅仅十多天时间，他们就把85％的早稻田插上了晚稻，并随即给一切可以车水浇灌的晚稻田普遍灌了一次水，实在无法车水浇灌的晚稻田，他们就用提前薅秧的办法，增强禾苗的抗旱能力。对于那些枯死缺苗的红薯地，则抽出人力突击补种红薯苗。现在补种的红薯苗大都已经成活。
    这个生产队在抢插晚稻、保苗的同时，还采取了许多有效的抗旱措施。例如：对于某些确实无水可车，不能插秧的梯田，坚决改种红薯。据计算，这些田改种红薯后，基本上可以弥补未种晚稻的损失。有少数榜田，已经干涸到不能开挖改种的程度，就决定留下早稻桩，培育再生稻。这些再生稻只要在追肥等管理工作上做的认真，每亩可产稻谷一百多斤。此外，队上还把所有的田边地角都划给社员，让他们利用工余时间增种粮食，这样，秋后每人就能多收二百斤粮食，可以弥补旱灾造成的一部分损失。
    经过初步核算，旱灾已经使这个生产队损失了约三四万斤粮食。但是社员们坚信，只要把增种、改种、加强田间管理等措施和抢插保苗紧密配合起来，不但被旱灾夺去了的粮食可以补上，连早稻少收的几千斤粮也可以拿回来。目前，他们正在抓紧晚稻、红薯的田间管理和晚秋作物栽种的准备工作。（附图片）
