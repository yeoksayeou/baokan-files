Eradicate Pests Thoroughly
　　Jiang Hao

The sanitation general assault campaign in the capital has been victoriously launched.

The characteristic of this sanitation assault campaign in the capital is not only its grand scale, but also its concentrated firepower, repeated clearing, and determination to achieve the requirement of completely eliminating mosquitoes and flies. If the people of the whole country can carry forward the resolute fighting spirit of the people of the capital in eradicating pests thoroughly, it will promote the accelerated progress of the national health movement.

Since last year, with the widespread launch of the health movement, various places have successively launched many sanitation assault campaigns of different scales, done a lot of regular sanitation work, and achieved great successes. However, there are still not many units and regions that have truly achieved the thorough elimination of the four pests. The existence of this situation is, of course, due to the arduousness and complexity of this task in most areas, which will require a considerable period of time to fully achieve; however, in some places, the progress of work is slow because people's understanding of the idea of ​​eradicating pests thoroughly is not clear enough, and the measures taken are not decisive enough. Some places have even relaxed their efforts due to being satisfied with the basic achievements already made in eliminating the four pests, so that the four pests have revived. Therefore, under this situation, further strengthening the concept of the enemy situation of the four pests and adopting a resolute strategic plan to thoroughly eliminate them will greatly benefit the development of the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests.

Now is the season when mosquitoes and flies are breeding in large numbers and harming people everywhere. If the number of mosquitoes and flies that people eliminate cannot exceed their reproduction rate, they will certainly not be able to control their reproduction. Even if adult mosquitoes and flies are eliminated completely, but the breeding conditions are not eliminated, they will still make a comeback; even if all their breeding conditions are eliminated, it is still necessary to pay attention to regular sanitation work and control them, so as not to let breeding conditions form again. It is of course very difficult to do all the above aspects of work well. However, after several years, especially since last year, the people of the whole country have recognized the breeding and activity patterns of the four pests through actual struggle, and have accumulated rich experience in eliminating them. They are not only powerless to eliminate the four pests. As long as they are determined, continue to work hard, they can plan to eliminate them within a certain period of time. The reason why the people of the capital put forward the goal of completely eliminating mosquitoes and flies and various specific measures in this assault campaign is the result of the people of the whole city summarizing the experience of past struggles. Other regions, as long as they can also make the determination to eradicate pests thoroughly and work hard, can also make greater achievements on the health front.

### 除害务尽

　　除害务尽
　　江浩
    首都的卫生大突击运动已胜利地展开了。
    这次首都卫生突击运动的特点，不仅在于规模壮阔，而且在于火力集中，反复清剿，决心要达到彻底消灭蚊蝇的要求。全国人民如果都能发扬首都人民除害务尽的坚决斗争精神，那就将促进全国卫生运动的加速进展。
    自去年以来，随着卫生运动的普遍展开，各地先后都展开了规模不同的许多次卫生突击运动，做了很多经常性的卫生工作，取得了巨大成就。但是，真正做到彻底消灭四害的单位和地区，还不多见。这种情况的存在固然在多数地区是由于这一任务的艰巨、复杂，还需要经过相当时间才能完全实现；但是，也有一些地方，由于人们对于除害务尽的思想还不够明确，采取的措施也还不够坚决，以致工作进展缓慢。甚至有的地方，由于满足于已得的基本消灭四害的成就，除害未尽就放松了努力，以致四害复生。因此，在这一情势下，进一步加强对四害的敌情观念，采取坚决的彻底消灭它们的战略部署，必将大大有利于以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的开展。
    现在正是蚊蝇大量繁殖、到处害人的季节。人们消灭蚊蝇的数量，如不能超过它们的繁殖率，固然不能控制它们的繁殖，即使把成蚊成蝇消灭干净，而没有把孳生条件消灭，它们仍然会死灰复燃；甚至，就是把它们的孳生条件全部消灭了，还要重视经常性的卫生工作，加以控制，不让孳生条件再度形成。要把以上各方面工作都做好，这当然是很艰巨的。但是，全国人民经过几年来特别是去年以来的实际斗争，已经认识了四害的繁殖和活动规律，积累了消灭它们的丰富经验，对于消灭四害不但不是无能为力，而且，只要斗志坚决，继续鼓足干劲，就可以有计划地在一定时间内把它们消灭。首都人民在这次突击运动中所以提出彻底消灭蚊蝇的目标和各项具体措施，就是全市人民总结过去斗争经验的结果。其他地区，只要也能痛下除害务尽的决心，鼓足干劲，也都可以在卫生战线上做出更大的成绩。
