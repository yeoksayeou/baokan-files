    Boiler Superheater
    Workers at the Longjiang Rubber Factory in Harbin have installed superheaters on three boilers, utilizing waste heat from the chimneys to increase the steam's temperature, achieving the effect of five boilers. This not only saves 1,000 tons of coal a year, but also raises the boiler steam temperature from 110 degrees to 180 degrees, shortening the tire vulcanization time (from 30 minutes to 20 minutes). At the same time, due to the sufficient steam supply and thorough vulcanization, the elasticity and wear resistance of the tires have been improved, greatly reducing the reject rate. The surplus steam can also be used for heating dormitories and offices, saving a batch of coal for heating. (Attached picture)

    锅炉过热器
    哈尔滨市龙江橡胶厂的职工在三台锅炉上安装了过热器，利用烟囱里的废热提高蒸汽的热度，发挥了五台锅炉的作用。这样不但一年能节省一千吨煤，而且使锅炉蒸汽由一百一十度上升到一百八十度，缩短了车胎的硫化时间（过去三十分钟，现在二十分钟），同时因为供汽充足硫化彻底，提高了车胎的弹力和耐磨力，大大降低了次品率。多余的蒸汽还可以供宿舍、办公室取暖，节省一批取暖用煤。（附图片）
