This Dispatch from Nanning, August 14th: Mo Youtian, a good housekeeper for farmers who lives among the masses and always walks ahead of the masses, has become a role model for the broad masses of cadres in the Wuzhou Special District of Guangxi. In the past two months or so, more than 30,000 commune-level cadres in the entire special district have been conscientiously studying his working methods and style, striving to further improve their ideological level and more deeply lead the current agricultural production.

Mo Youtian is the deputy director of Xindi Commune in Cangwu County and a Communist Party member. Last spring, he voluntarily requested the commune party committee to send him to work in the Huilong area to help the four relatively backward production brigades catch up with the advanced. With his specific help and the efforts of the team cadres, the backwardness of these four brigades has been rapidly changed, and all four teams have jumped into the ranks of the advanced. This year, the average yield per mu of early rice in these four teams increased from 380 jin last year to more than 560 jin, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. At present, the summer and autumn production campaign is also flourishing.

Not long after Mo Youtian came to work in the Huilong area, he established a deep relationship with the masses, and everywhere he went he had confidants, and many friends became good advisors and consultants in Mo Youtian's work. In arranging work and handling problems, he always talked with the commune members repeatedly, requiring that every job be done to the hearts of the masses.

A month before the start of this year's summer harvest and planting, Mo Youtian heard from his friend Liang Dianli during a conversation that "We have many mountain and ravine fields here, and late rice is most afraid of the cold dew wind. If we can start early, harvest and plant quickly, and let the late rice head before the cold dew wind, there is hope for a bumper harvest." He was inspired by these words and immediately convened a meeting of party members, league members, veteran farmers, commune member representatives, and activists to discuss the problems in rushing the harvest and planting and increasing the production of late rice. Through the discussion, everyone's understanding of the importance of seizing the season was generally improved, and they unanimously requested to do a good job in preparing for the "double rush" work, striving for late rice to surpass early rice. Then he helped the cadres of each team carefully arrange labor, repair tools, soak seeds and sow, accumulate fertilizer, and create fertilizer. After such meticulous work and proper arrangements, the four production brigades quickly launched a hot summer harvest and planting production.

Mo Youtian tried every means to ask others for advice on things he did not understand, until he understood them thoroughly, before becoming a "teacher" to lead the masses to do them. Last year, when planting late rice, there was a lack of fine fertilizer, and many commune members thought that the good fertilizer had been swept away and no new methods could be found. When he heard that the old farmer Chen Wenbing had used coarse fertilizer to make a composite fertilizer with good results, he immediately asked Chen Wenbing for advice and personally made it, and put it in the fields separately. A few days later, he saw that the fertilizer effect was indeed good, and then he organized cadres and hundreds of commune members to come to visit. Many people saw the black, oily fertilizer and smelled the pungent odor, and said it was "good pig manure." After Mo Youtian's detailed introduction, the commune members learned that the fertilizer was made by fermenting pond mud, weeds, ashes, nitrate water, coal dust, and lime, and felt that it was easy to make. People went to the fields to take a look and saw that the seedlings fertilized with this fertilizer grew green and strong, and everyone felt that they had a solution and immediately started working when they returned. Within six or seven days, these four teams had produced a large amount of fine fertilizer.

Mo Youtian is good at listening to the opinions of the majority, but he never ignores the opinions of a few people or even one person. Last year, before the early rice transplanting, the commune members held a meeting to argue about the density of planting. At the meeting, the vast majority of people spoke enthusiastically, but Chen Wenjie sat in the corner and said nothing. It was not until late at night when the meeting was dismissed that he mumbled, "According to the dense planting specifications you talked about, it may be possible to increase production, but I just don't agree!" Mo Youtian happened to hear this opposing opinion, and he thought about it: Chen Wenjie is an old farmer who has grown crops for decades, and his words always make some sense. The next day, he visited him to ask for advice and seek the root of the matter. At that time, Chen Wenjie didn't say a word, and took him to the field, pointing to two fields with the same soil quality, and asked him to carefully observe them. Then, Chen Wenjie hurriedly said: "The soil here is fertile. In 1957, I planted this field with 5×7, and the yield per mu was 720 jin; the young people planted that field with 5×4, but it fell down later, and the yield per mu was 480 jin, which planting method do you think is good!" Mo Youtian judged for a while, and finally understood a principle: "For fertile fields, the tillering power of rice seedlings is strong and the development is strong, so it should be planted sparsely, and it cannot be generalized." He turned around and discussed with everyone again, and finally determined that most of the fields still used 5×4 and 6×4 specifications, and some fertile fields were planted with 5×7. The commune members were all satisfied.

Because Mo Youtian and the commune members are in close contact and have a heart-to-heart relationship, no matter what work, the enthusiasm of the leaders and the enthusiasm of the masses, the enthusiasm of the leaders and the enthusiasm of the masses are always intertwined. The commune members said: "With good cadres, everything is to our liking, and we are particularly motivated to work, so why worry about not doing a good job in production." (Attached picture)

　　深入困难地区　改变落后面貌
　　莫有天的群众路线作风是梧州专区广大基层干部的榜样
    本报南宁14日电　生活在群众中间，处处走在群众前面的农民的好当家莫有天，已成为广西梧州专区广大干部的学习榜样。最近两个多月以来，全专区有三万多名公社基层干部，都在认真地学习他的工作方法和工作作风，力求进一步提高思想水平，更深入地领导好当前农业生产。
    莫有天是苍梧县新地公社的副主任、共产党员。去年春天，他主动请求公社党委派他到回龙地区工作，帮助那里四个比较落后的生产大队去赶先进。在他的具体帮助和队干部的努力下，这四个大队的落后面貌已迅速改观，四个队都跃进到先进行列。今年这四个队的早稻亩产量，平均由去年的三百八十斤增加到五百六十多斤，获得了空前大丰收。目前夏秋季生产运动又蓬蓬勃勃地开展了起来。
    莫有天到回龙地区工作不久，就和群众建立了深厚感情，到处都有他的知心朋友，而且很多朋友成了莫有天工作中的好参谋、好顾问。他在安排工作和处理问题中，总是三番五次找社员群众谈心，要求件件工作都做到群众心里去。
    今年夏收夏种开始前一个月，莫有天在和社员梁典礼谈心中，听到这位朋友说：“我们这儿山冲田多，晚稻最怕寒露风，如果能早点动手，快收快种，让晚稻在寒露风前齐穗勾头，丰产就有指望了。”他从这几句话里得到了启发，随即召开党团员、老农、社员代表和积极分子参加的会议，商量抢收抢种和晚稻增产中的问题。通过讨论，大家对抢季节重要性的认识普遍提高了，一致要求做好双抢准备工作。力争晚稻超早稻。然后他就帮助各队干部仔细安排劳力、修整工具、浸种播种、积肥造肥等工作。经过这样细致的工作和妥当的安排之后，这四个生产大队很快掀起了夏收夏种的生产热潮。
    莫有天对自己不懂的东西，就千方百计向别人请教，一直到弄通了，才当“先生”领导群众去干。去年晚稻插秧时，缺乏精肥，很多社员认为好肥扫光了，拿不出新办法。他听到老农陈文炳曾用粗肥沤制成综合肥料，效果很好，便立即请教陈文炳，并亲自沤制，分别放到田里。几天后，他见肥效果然不错，才组织干部和几百个社员前来参观。很多人看到这乌油油的肥料，闻到了刺鼻的臭味，都说是“好猪屎。”经过莫有天详细推荐，社员们才知道这肥料是用塘坭、杂草、草木灰、硝水、火烟煤和石灰沤成的，并感到制起来很容易。人们再到田里一看，见施过这种肥料的秧苗长得又绿又壮，人人都觉得有了办法，回去马上干起来。在六、七天内，这四个队就制成了大批精肥。
    莫有天善于倾听多数人的意见，但对少数人甚至一个人的意见也从不忽略。去年早稻插秧前，社员们开会争论密植幅度问题。会上，绝大多数人都热烈发言，只有陈文杰坐在角落里，一言不发。直到深夜散会时，他才咕咕哝哝地说：“按照你们谈的密植的规格也许能增产，我硬是不服！”这一反面意见恰好给莫有天听到了，他想了一想：陈文杰是种过几十年庄稼的老农，他这话总多少有点道理。第二天，他登门求教，寻求根底。当时陈文杰一句话也没说，就带他到田里，指着两丘土质相同的田，请他细细察看。随后，陈文杰才急促地说：“这里的田土质肥厚。1957年，我这丘田插的是5×7，亩产七百二十斤；青年们那丘田插5×4，后来倒伏了，亩产四百八十斤，你说那种插法好！”莫有天判断了一番，终于明白了一个道理：“肥田，禾苗分蘖力强，发育旺，就应该插稀点，不能千篇一律。”他回过头来又找大家商量，最后确定：大部分田仍采用5×4和6×4两种规格，部分肥田则插5×7。社员们个个满意。
    由于莫有天和社员们息息相通，心心相印，不论什么工作，领导的积极性和群众的积极性、领导的热情和群众的热情，总是交织在一起。社员们说：“有了好干部，样样工作合心意，干起活来格外有劲，那愁生产搞不好。”（附图片）
