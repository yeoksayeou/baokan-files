Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 1st: The armed struggle of the Nicaraguan people against the Somoza dictatorship continues to develop.

According to a report by the Latin American News Agency today, anti-dictatorial armed forces in Nicaragua, led by Diaz Sotelo and Hernan Argüello, engaged in battle with the National Guard in northern Nicaragua. Other anti-government armed groups have attacked several cities, and peasants in the Masaya region have staged an uprising and entered the mountains. A batch of armed forces opposed to the Somoza regime also entered Nicaragua after breaking through the border blockade. Meanwhile, other armed groups are concentrating in groups on the border, preparing to break through the blockade. This new armed force is organized by Cipriano Pastora, an anti-dictatorial leader. He led some of the soldiers and already started an armed struggle in Nicaragua. They broke through the border blockade in the mountains near Peñas Blancas. Another armed force is also advancing towards this area.

Students at the National University of Nicaragua recently launched a struggle against the dictatorship in the Leon region, fifty miles northwest of the capital, Managua. Under the threat of bayonets of the National Guard, they held a religious ceremony on July 27 to mourn the students who were shot and killed by the military police. On the same day, the masses in the Leon region responded to the Somoza dictatorship's brutal suppression of students by burning down the official residence of the Leon region police chief and throwing stones at government buildings.
