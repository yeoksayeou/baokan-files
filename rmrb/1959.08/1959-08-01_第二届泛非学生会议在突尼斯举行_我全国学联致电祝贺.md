Xinhua News Agency, 31st – The All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the Second Pan-African Student Conference, scheduled to open on August 1st in Tunisia, extending warm congratulations on behalf of all Chinese students.

The telegram said, "Chinese youth and students, who have themselves suffered from imperialist oppression, are constantly watching with infinite sympathy and concern the struggle of the African people and youth students against colonialism and for national independence. Chinese youth students, together with all the Chinese people, fully support your just struggle. We will always be your closest and most reliable friends in your struggle."

The telegram said, "In the current international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are vigorously developing, and have converged into an irresistible torrent, impacting the crumbling colonial system. Although the imperialists are still carrying out frantic counterattacks and suppression, this will never save their increasingly precarious fate."

The telegram concluded, "We firmly believe that with the support of the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, the struggle of the African people and youth for national independence will surely achieve final victory."

    第二届泛非学生会议在突尼斯举行
    我全国学联致电祝贺
    新华社31日讯　中华全国学生联合会今天打电报给订于8月1日在突尼斯召开的第二届泛非学生会议，代表全中国学生对会议表示热烈的祝贺。
    电报说，“曾经遭受过帝国主义压迫的中国青年和学生，经常以无限同情和关怀的心情，注视着非洲人民和青年学生为反对殖民主义、争取民族独立而进行的斗争。中国青年学生和全中国人民一起，全力支持你们的正义斗争。我们将永远是你们斗争中最亲密和可靠的朋友。”
    电报说，“在目前东风压倒西风的国际形势下，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动正在蓬勃发展，它已经汇成一股无法阻挡的洪流，冲击着摇摇欲坠的殖民主义制度。尽管帝国主义者还在进行疯狂的反扑和镇压，但这决挽救不了它日益垂危的命运。”
    电报最后说，“我们深信，在亚非人民和全世界人民的支持下，非洲人民和青年争取民族独立的斗争必将获得最后的胜利。”
