Ferric Oxide Pigment Passes Quality Inspection
By Our Correspondent Shu Di

It was still late spring, when the willows were budding and the peach blossoms were flying. The gentle breeze blowing from the Xin Kai River stirred the wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys of the Jianhua Branch of the Tianjin Paint and Pigment General Factory. However, the breeze did not bring much coolness to the workers in front of the roasting furnaces. Lu Muyi, a slightly chubby engineer, held a long iron rake and, without bothering to wipe the sweat from his brow, leaned over and stirred the ferric oxide pigment in the roasting furnace. He felt more and more that something must have gone wrong at a crucial point today, otherwise, why would stirring be so awkward?

This forty-something engineer, a Communist Party member named Lu Muyi, had been pondering recently that without a complete set of operating procedures, there could be no talk of product quality. And to formulate a good set of operating procedures, how could one do it without being familiar with the production process and understanding the workers' operations? Therefore, he adopted the method of following workers on the job, earnestly learning from them, so that he could revise the operating procedures for ferric oxide pigment with the workers to make them more perfect.

Ferric oxide pigment is a high-grade primer used for metal rust prevention, with a wide range of uses. The raw material for making this primer—scrap iron—is abundant. In April of this year, the factory decided to expand the production of ferric oxide pigment. However, the production situation at that time was very bad: low quality and low output. The factory's Party committee and administrative leaders entrusted Lu Muyi with the task of improving the quality of ferric oxide pigment.

From then on, Lu Muyi squeezed out time almost every day to work with the workers, observing their operations and looking for ways to improve them technically. When the temperature of the roasting furnace could not be raised, Lu Muyi worked with the technicians and workers of the red lead workshop to study and raise the furnace temperature. After the furnace temperature was solved, a new problem arose: the quality of the matrix in the first process of ferric oxide pigment production was not good, either too thin or too thick. Lu Muyi planned to redo several medium-sized pilot productions to find out the reason for the poor quality, but some people disagreed, saying that the poor quality of ferric oxide pigment was because the chemical changes in the production process were too complicated, and the factory's equipment was simple, which was not feasible at all, and that doing medium-sized pilot productions was superfluous. Lu Muyi did not agree with this view, believing that problems could not be found without experimentation. The Party and administrative leaders of the factory supported Lu Muyi, and drew two workers to work with him to continuously study and change the formula, adjust the air volume, increase or decrease the temperature, and repeatedly ponder the matter. They worked hard for half a month, and finally found a way to control the air pressure and improve the quality of the matrix. Soon, through analyzing production records, Lu Muyi also worked with the workers in the oxidation process to study a new way to improve the quality of iron yellow—a semi-finished product of iron red.

When Lu Muyi shifted his work to the roasting furnace, problems arose again, and the ferric oxide pigment still could not be turned over easily. It turned out that the loading amount exceeded the regulations. This was very unfavorable to quality. Some people said: "What does it matter, just use more effort and sweat more, and it will be fine." However, Engineer Lu was not sure. Soon the iron red was out of the furnace. Lu Muyi pinched a little and twisted it hard. Sure enough, there were grains of hard lumps the size of millet grains inside, which had some impact on the quality, but the problem was not big. He deeply felt from this incident that although the workers loaded more material, the operating procedures that were previously set were indeed conservative. After several more furnace tests, the loading amount was revised to ensure product quality.

However, things were not as easy as people imagined. The color of the iron red looked very good, purplish-red, which was pleasing to the eye, but most of it did not have gloss, which was still far from the quality requirements. Engineer Lu took this iron red with insufficient gloss to the laboratory for re-roasting, and finally it emitted gloss.

The quality of ferric oxide pigment was rising day by day, but it was not stable enough. Chemistry is such that even a little bit of difference is not acceptable. If a reaction is not correct, the entire product will be scrapped. Engineer Lu decided to give technical lessons to the workers, so that the workers could understand the importance of complying with the operating procedures, and let every worker learn formulas and calculations. Soon, the workers in the ferric oxide pigment workshop all participated in learning technical lessons. Veteran masters such as Wang Wenhua and Sun Yuhua often used their time after work to help workers review the courses. After the workers increased their technical and theoretical knowledge, things that affected the quality due to miscalculating proportions have completely disappeared. The quality of ferric oxide pigment finally approached the products of Shanghai, and some items even exceeded Shanghai.

    铁红颜料过了质量关
    本报记者　舒倜
    论时间，那还是柳枝嫩绿桃花飞的残春季节。从新开河上刮过的阵阵和风，卷起天津市油漆颜料总厂建华分厂烟囱里升起的袅袅轻烟，但是，微风没有给焙烧炉前的劳动者们送来多少凉意。身体微胖的工程师鲁慕颐握着长长的铁耙，顾不得抹一抹额上的汗珠，正侧身弯腰地在翻动焙烧炉中的铁红颜料。他越来越感到，今天，一定是在那个节骨眼上出了毛病，要不，怎么翻动起来，会那么别扭。
    这位四十多岁的工程师，共产党员——鲁慕颐，近来常常寻思，没有一套完整的操作规程，就谈不到产品质量；要订出一套好的操作过程，不熟悉生产过程，不懂得工人的操作，又怎么能行呢？于是，他采用了跟班劳动的方法，认真地向工人学习，以便和工人一起，把铁红颜料的操作规程修订得更完善。
    铁红颜料，是金属防锈用的高级底漆，用途很广，做这种底漆的材料——废铁，来源很充裕。今年4月间，工厂决定扩大铁红颜料的生产。但是，当时的生产情况很糟糕：质量低，产量少。工厂党委和行政领导上便把提高铁红颜料质量的任务交给了鲁慕颐。
    从那以后，鲁慕颐几乎每天都要挤出时间，和工人一起劳动，观察工人们的操作，从技术上寻找改进方法。焙烧炉的温度增加不上去，鲁慕颐就和红丹工段的技师、工人一起研究，提高了炉温。炉温解决了，又出现了新的问题：铁红颜料生产第一道工序的基质质量不好，不是过稀就是过稠。鲁慕颐打算重做几次中型试制，找出质量不好的原因，但是，有些人不同意，说是铁红颜料的质量不好，是因为生产过程中化学变化太复杂，工厂设备简陋，根本不行，认为做中型试制是多此一举。鲁慕颐不赞成这种说法，他认为不试验，就找不出毛病。工厂的党、政领导支持了鲁慕颐，抽调了两个工人，和他在一起不断研究改变配方，调整风量，增减温度，一次又一次地反复捉摸，他们整整忙了半个多月，终于找到了控制风压、提高基质质量的方法。不久，鲁慕颐通过分析生产记录，又和氧化工序的工人一起研究出提高铁黄——铁红的半成品——质量的新途径。
    当鲁慕颐把自己的工作转移到焙烧炉的时候，问题又来了，铁红颜料仍然翻不动。原来是装料量超过了规定。这样对质量是很不利的。有人说：“那怕什么，多使点儿劲，多流点儿汗，不就行了。”可是，鲁工程师心里没有底。不久铁红出炉了，鲁慕颐捏了一点儿，使劲一捻，里面果然有小米粒儿大小的一粒粒硬块，对质量有些影响，但是问题不大。他从这件事情中深深感到，虽然工人们把料装多了，但是过去订的操作规程，确实是保守了。又经过了几炉试验，重新修订了装料量，保证了产品质量。
    可是，事情并不像人们想像的那么容易。铁红的色头看来很好，紫红紫红的，看了让人喜欢，但大半没有亮光，离质量要求还有距离。鲁工程师把这种光亮不够的铁红拿到实验室重新焙烧，终于发出了亮光。
    铁红颜料的质量一天跟着一天地上升，就是不够稳定。化学这个玩意儿，差一点儿都不行，一个反应不对，产品就会全部报销。鲁工程师决定给工人讲技术课，使工人懂得遵守操作规程的重要，让每一个工人都学会公式和计算。不久，铁红颜料工段的工人们都参加学习技术课。王文华、孙玉华等老师傅，还常常利用下班以后的时间，帮工人复习课程。工人增加了技术理论知识以后，因算错比例影响质量的事情，已经完全绝迹了。铁红颜料的质量终于接近了上海的产品，有些项目还超过了上海。
