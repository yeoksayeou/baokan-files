　　Old Xiao of the Orchard
　　Liu Di
    "This year, our farm is having another bumper harvest of apples and grapes!" Director Ma was originally going to introduce the situation of the Yellow River flooded area farm to us, but after only a few words, the topic changed. "Our Old Xiao really has a knack for horticultural management!"
    Although we haven't met this Old Xiao, we've heard people mention him many times since coming to the farm. This time, Director Ma mentioned him again: "He's been in this line of work for over twenty years, and he's figured out the temperament of all kinds of fruit trees. He's no simple man! Old Xiao has also successfully experimented with some new fruit tree cultivation techniques. In the past, it took at least three years for fruit tree seedlings to go from sowing and grafting to leaving the nursery. Who ever heard of seedlings leaving the nursery in one year? But Old Xiao has a way. He sows the seeds in the spring, grafts them that year, and they leave the nursery in the winter. This is called rapid seedling cultivation. Who ever heard of apple seedlings bearing fruit as early as three years? Old Xiao has also successfully experimented with this. In the past, it always took six or seven years, but he cut the time in half at once."
    The next day, we went to the work station to visit. In the fruit tree nursery of Yinpo Village, a group of young women were grafting apple seedlings. Each of them held a small knife and deftly grafted tender apple buds onto crabapple seedlings. We praised their skillful technique, and one of the girls said shyly, "Skillful? We just learned from Old Xiao!" After a pause, she said enviously, "I can only graft three or four hundred trees a day, but Technician Xiao can graft fifteen or sixteen hundred!" Someone around asked a question about grafting techniques, and then several workers confidently said, "There's no mistake, Old Xiao told us to do it this way."
    Leaving the farm headquarters and heading west, we walked along an endless apple orchard. The apple trees grew lush and strong, and the green leaves sparkled in the sun. The wide and dense branches couldn't hide the abundant fruits, and the apples peeked out one by one.
    This is the apple orchard cultivated by Old Xiao and his team. We walked and admired this alluring scenery. Orioles were singing in the trees, and suddenly a burst of hearty laughter from the girls rang out from the depths of the orchard.
    "Has Old Xiao been here?"
      "He came and left."
    We went to the horticulture training class, but we didn't find him there either. There were over a hundred people in the training class, and the trainees came from various counties in Xuchang Prefecture. Their teacher was Old Xiao. It is said that in addition to teaching them practical operating techniques, Old Xiao also lectured on many theoretical issues in botany and horticulture. Old Xiao had neither a teaching syllabus nor teaching materials. He even has difficulty taking notes! But with just a mouth, a pair of hands, and his own rich experience, he imparts a lot of valuable knowledge to the trainees.
    Finally, we found him in the vineyard. However, just as we were about to start interviewing him, a group of students from Beijing Agricultural University who came to intern also arrived. The minority defers to the majority, so we had to let them talk first. These college students were from the meteorology department, and they first asked him some questions. Old Xiao smiled憨厚地 and said:
  "I'm a rough old fellow, I have nothing to say." But, as he smiled, he started talking to the students.
    This man is of medium build, with a round face, thin and looks very simple and honest. He is not very old, in his thirties, but he has been a horticultural apprentice since he was a child. He has lived with fruit trees for more than twenty years, and his stomach has become a textbook. Look, he is talking endlessly to the college students, full of technical terms and academic principles. We can't understand many of the questions, but there is one thing we understand. He said that one year, when the grapes were about to ripen, they suddenly suffered from black bean disease. No matter how he sprayed the medicine according to the methods described in the books, he couldn't cure it. He was so worried that he couldn't eat or sleep, and he stayed in front of the grape trellis all day like a nurse guarding a patient. Later, he thought of shortening the spraying time and increasing the concentration of the medicine according to the severity of the disease. As a result, the dying grapes turned from danger to safety. Speaking of this, Old Xiao said meaningfully:
  "Fruit trees are like people, you have to care about them, take care of them. You have to know when they are cold, hot, thirsty, hungry, sick, what medicine they should take, how much they should eat, etc. You can't take care of them well at any time! If only we could talk to plants!"
    Old Xiao talked to us a lot later, but the topic was always about his orchard. He talked about how he was beaten and bullied when he worked in the orchard before liberation, and how he studied technology and learned scientific knowledge under the cultivation of the Party after liberation. He also told about how he encountered difficulties and how he overcame them; how many times the fruit trees suffered from pests and diseases, which made him so upset that he couldn't sleep or eat, and how many times the harvest brought him infinite joy. When he talked about those fruit trees, it was like talking about his own children, large and small.
    "Look! How strong this tree is, it's only four or five years old! But it yielded more than 100 catties of apples last year." After speaking, he walked to another small tree and lovingly stroked the tender branches of the tree with his hands, like treating his own child, and whispered: "It's not in good health! It just suffered a serious illness last year!"
    Old Xiao has a hobby: he studies whatever is difficult, and he keeps at it until he gets to the bottom of it. He himself said: "The more difficult things are, the more people have to do them. If everything is easy, then there is no need for people to build socialism." If a problem cannot be solved, he is simply lost and restless, sometimes staying in the orchard all day long, looking around and thinking. One year, the apple trees did not grow well, and a technician named Kou determined that it was suffering from canker disease, so he used the method of plowing, scraping, and pulling to deal with it. The apple trees at that time were scraped and bleeding half-dead. Old Xiao felt pain when he looked at it, and felt that it did not look like canker disease, but he couldn't say why. He painstakingly experimented and sat under the apple tree to observe all day long, and finally figured out that it was a climate relationship that caused the fruit trees to shed their skin. A large area of apple trees was saved by Old Xiao.
    "That really stumped me at the time!" Old Xiao recalled, "The Party committee proposed to let the apples bear fruit early, but the technician disagreed. He said that apples are 'early in five years, good in seven years', and it is impossible to bear fruit early, and also said that this is stipulated in the books. But I felt that the Party committee's proposal made sense, more, faster, better and more economical! The people are waiting to eat apples, why should apples bear fruit late?" Then, he talked about the tortuous and complicated experimental process. "In the third year of the seedling growth, the apple trees bore fruit, the highest yielded thirty or forty catties, which really made me happy to death. Now, apple trees can also implement the general line of more, faster, better and more economical!" Speaking, Old Xiao smiled happily.

　　果园老萧
　　柳笛
    “今年我们农场里，苹果、葡萄又是一场大丰收啊！”马场长本来是要向我们介绍黄泛区农场情况的，可是没说几句，话题就转了。“咱们的老萧在园艺管理上真有一套！”
    这老萧，我们虽然没有见过，但是，到农场来以后，却听人说到过多少回了。这回，马场长又在说起他了：“他呀，他干这一行有二十多年了，各种果树的脾气算是被他摸透了。不简单呵！老萧还试验成功了一些培育果树的新技术哩。过去，果树苗从播种、嫁接到出圃，至少要三年时间，哪里听说过有一年出圃的呢？可是老萧就有办法，春天播下种，当年嫁接，到冬天就出圃了，这叫做快速育苗。谁听说过苹果苗三年早结果的事啊！老萧也试验成功了，过去总要六、七年，他一下子就把时间提前了一半。”
    第二天，我们到作业站里去参观。在尹坡村的果树苗圃里，一群年轻的姑娘正在嫁接苹果苗，她们每人拿把小刀，动作敏捷地把一棵棵嫩小的苹果枝芽接种到海棠苗上去。我们称赞了一句她们的技术熟练，一位姑娘羞答答地说：“熟啥！俺们是刚才向老萧学习哩！”停了停，她又用羡慕的口吻说：“俺一天才接三、四百棵，人家萧技术员一天能接一千五、六！”周围的人不知谁对嫁接技术提了个疑问，接着就有好几位工人理直气壮地说：“这不会有错，是老萧让这样做的。”
    出场部向西，我们沿着一片望不尽的苹果园走去。苹果树生长得茂密而茁壮，绿油油的叶子被太阳一照，闪闪发光，宽密的枝叶怎么也遮蔽不住那些丰硕的果子，一个个的苹果探头探脑地露在外面。
    这就是老萧他们培育的苹果园。我们一边走一边欣赏着这诱人的美景。树上黄莺在叫，果园深处忽然响起一阵女孩子们朗朗的笑声。
    “老萧到这里来过吗？”
      “来过，又走了。”
    我们到园艺训练班，又没有找见他。这训练班有一百多人，学员都是从许昌专区各县来的，他们的老师也就是老萧。据说，老萧除了教他们实际操作技术，还讲许多植物学、园艺学上的理论问题。老萧既没有什么教学大纲，也没有什么教材，他甚至连记笔记都还挺困难呢！可是就凭一张嘴、一双手和自己的丰富经验，他向学员们传授着许多宝贵的知识。
    最后，我们总算在葡萄园里把他找到了。可是，正当我们开始访问他的时候，北京农业大学一群来实习的学生也来了。少数服从多数，我们只好让他们先谈。这些大学生是气象系的，他们先向他提了一些问题，老萧憨厚地笑笑说：
  “我是个大老粗，没啥讲的。”可是，笑着笑着，他就跟学生们谈开了。
    这人是个中等身材，圆脸儿，瘦瘦的，样子很淳朴。他年纪并不大，三十多岁，可是从光屁股的时候起就已经当上园艺学徒工了。他和果树一起生活了二十多年，肚子就成了一部教科书。你瞧，他向大学生们滔滔不绝地讲述着，满口的技术名词和学术上的道理，许多问题我们都听不懂，但是有一件事情我们听明白了。他说，有一年葡萄快要熟的时候，突然患了黑豆病，按照书本上说的办法喷撒药水怎么也治不好，愁的他吃不下饭，睡不着觉，像看护病人一样整天守在葡萄架前。后来，他想起应该根据害情缩短喷药的时间，加大药水的浓度，结果使快要死的葡萄转危为安了。说到这里，老萧意味深长地说：
  “果树和人一样，要去关心他，体贴他，冷了，热了，渴了，饿了，病了应该吃什么药，吃多少等等，这些你都要知道，一时照顾不周到都不行啊！我们什么时候能和植物说话就好了！”
    老萧以后同我们谈了很多，但话题都离不开他的果树园。他说解放前在果园里做工如何挨打受气，解放后又如何在党的培育下钻研技术，学习科学知识。他还诉说怎样遇到了困难，又怎样战胜了困难；多少次果树遭受病虫灾害使他苦恼得寝食不安，又有多少次的丰收给他带来无限的喜悦。他说着那些果树，就像说自己的一群儿女，一家子的大大小小。
    “你瞧！这棵树多壮实，它才四、五岁哩！可去年就结了一百多斤苹果。”说完，他又走到另一棵小树跟前，像对待自己的孩子一样，抚爱地用手抚摸着树的嫩枝，低声说：“它身体不好啊！去年刚患了一场大病呢！”
    老萧有个癖好：什么事难，他就钻研什么，而且一直到弄出个青红皂白为止。他自己说：“越是困难的事情，才越要人做，凡事都轻而易举，就不要人去建设社会主义了。”如果有一个问题解不开，他简直就失魂落魄地坐卧不安，有时一整天一整天地呆在果木林里左思右盼。有一年苹果树长得不好，一个姓寇的技术员断定是得了腐烂病，就采用耕、刮、拔的办法来对付，那时的苹果树被刮得皮破血流半死半活，老萧看着心痛，觉得不像是腐烂病，但又说不出个道理来。他苦心试验，整天坐在苹果树下观察，终于弄明白了，原来是气候关系，果树脱皮。大片的苹果树被老萧救活了。
    “那时候可把我难坏了！”老萧回忆着说，“党委提出让苹果早结果，可是技术员不同意，他说苹果是‘五年早，七年好’，要想早结果根本不行，而且还说这是书上规定的。可是我就觉得党委提得有道理，多快好省嘛！人民等着吃苹果，为什么苹果偏偏要晚结果呢？”接着，他讲了曲折复杂的试验过程。“树苗长到第三年上，苹果树结果了，最高的结到三、四十斤，真把我乐死了。如今，苹果树也能多快好省地执行总路线了！”说着，老萧乐滋滋地笑了。
