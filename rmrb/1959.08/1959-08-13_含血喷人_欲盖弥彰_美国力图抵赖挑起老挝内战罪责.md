Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 12th: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 11th regarding the situation in Laos, making every effort to conceal and shirk the responsibility of the United States for instigating the Lao authorities to launch a civil war and create tension, and instead falsely accused the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of creating a "dangerous situation."

　　The State Department's statement attempts to shift the blame for the U.S.'s hand in provoking the Laotian civil war onto the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement groundlessly claims that the former Lao Fighting Forces, who had no choice but to rise up in self-defense under the Lao authorities' attack, "are stationed in areas that can only obtain supplies from the communists in North Vietnam" and that the command of these forces "is conducted from North Vietnam." The State Department's statement attempts to deny the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's condemnation of the United States for creating the Laotian civil war and thus causing a dangerous situation, and instead falsely accuses the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of "attempting to create a dangerous situation."

　　The State Department's statement said that the United States "has not established bases in Laos, nor are there any troops there." However, it evaded the fact that the United States sent a large number of military advisors and transported a large number of weapons and ammunition to Laos, which is the main means by which the United States is currently instigating the Lao authorities to conduct a civil war and create tension.

　　The State Department's statement also mentioned that Lieutenant Colonel Leisy, a U.S. Army Attaché, recently went to Sam Neua to learn about the progress of the Laotian civil war, visited the local Lao garrison commander, Phoumi Nosavan, and "submitted a brief preliminary report." According to Western news agency reports, the purpose of this action by the United States is to create an excuse to bring in the United Nations to further interfere in Laos' internal affairs.

### 含血喷人　欲盖弥彰　美国力图抵赖挑起老挝内战罪责

　　含血喷人　欲盖弥彰
　　美国力图抵赖挑起老挝内战罪责
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院11日再一次就老挝局势发表声明，竭力掩饰和推卸美国唆使老挝当局发动内战和制造紧张局势的罪责，并且反诬越南民主共和国制造“危险局势”。
    国务院的声明企图把美国一手挑起老挝内战的罪责推到越南民主共和国身上。声明毫无根据地硬说，在老挝当局进攻下最后不得不起而自卫的前寮国战斗部队“驻在只能从北越的共产党人那里获得供应的地区”，对这些部队的指挥“是从北越进行的”。国务院的声明力图抵赖越南民主共和国对于美国制造老挝内战从而引起危险局势的谴责，并且反诬越南民主共和国“正在企图制造一种危险的局势”。
    国务院的声明说美国“并没有在老挝建立基地，也没有部队在那里”。但是，它却回避美国向老挝派进大批军事顾问和运进大批武器弹药的事实，而这正是美国在目前主使老挝当局进行内战和制造紧张局势的主要手段。
    国务院的声明还谈到，美国的一个陆军武官累西中校最近特地到桑怒了解老挝内战的进程，访问了当地的老挝驻军司令冯纳腊特，并且“提出了一个简短的初步报告”。据西方通讯社的报道透露，美国这一行动的目的是打算制造借口，搬出联合国来进一步干涉老挝的内政。
