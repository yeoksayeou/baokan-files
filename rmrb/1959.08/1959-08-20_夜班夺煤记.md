Night Shift Coal Seizure Record
By Our Correspondent Wang Yiju

Entering August, the workers of the Fifth Mining Area of the Xing'antai Coal Mine under the Hegang Mining Bureau of Heilongjiang Province are advancing towards the goal of monthly excess and quarterly overproduction, a "full house red" with an overwhelming momentum.

	This Shift is Stronger Than the Previous One

It had just gotten dark, and the second shift of coal miners who took over at 4:30 pm had already been working for more than three hours. The reporter came to the mine with Zhao Mingde, the director of this mining area. This is the Seventh Mining Team. Standing at a high place, at a glance, it looks like a straight corridor, with well-organized pit wood supports arranged in neat rows; the miners' headlamps are radiating light with the tense labor operation. The dug coal is flowing down the chute like a waterfall, rushing into the coal car. ... The coal miners are using the newly learned parallel cross-flow operation method. Coal mining, roof releasing, support workers, and underground transportation are interlocked like a machine, operating rhythmically. Director Zhao told us that by adopting this advanced experience, it is possible to produce coal continuously for twenty-four hours.

We went to the top of the coal mining face. Wang Yuxiu, the leader of the Second Squad, was wielding a large pickaxe to dig at the bottom coal. With him was Qi Dengyun, both young people of similar age. The shovels waved in their hands like a small power shovel. The floating coal flowed along the chute to the coal loading station.

A few steps down from the Seventh Mining Team is the "Brave Youth Coal Mining Team" – the Eighth Mining Team, which is famous throughout the mine. In fact, this coal mining team is not only brave but also intelligent. Since the launch of the "Good Start" campaign in August, the three coal mining groups of this coal mining team have been competing fiercely. Zhou Qinggeng's group was on duty here. The original production plan for this shift was ninety tons, but the previous shift, Ding Guodong's group, gave them a difficult problem, with those people actually producing one hundred and five tons. How could Zhou Qinggeng's group accept this? So, as soon as they started work, everyone was eager to try, determined to catch up. At the pre-shift "Zhuge Liang" meeting before going down the mine, everyone discussed and raised the group's production plan for this shift to one hundred and four tons. And what is said must be done, this is the old rule of Zhou Qinggeng's group. Everyone spoke their mind and came up with two good solutions: the first is to "strike first." Two people for drilling holes and two people for blasting will go down the mine half an hour in advance (and also finish work half an hour earlier, without extending working hours), first put the coal chute in place, and then set off a row of explosives, and as soon as the shift starts, coal will be produced immediately. The second, in their words, is to "use good steel on the cutting edge," let the most capable old workers in the group, Feng Yonggui, Zhang Guichen, and Li Fushun, do the work of drilling holes, blasting, and also put up pit wood supports, all doing the "cutting edge" work. When we walked up to them, group leader Zhou Qinggeng told Director Zhao, "We've done eleven cars in four hours this shift!" Eleven cars is sixty-six tons. But Director Zhao could not help but use a "carrot and stick approach." He said, "If you don't do well in the next four hours, you still won't be 'red'!" It turns out that here, the words "complete the plan" and "over fulfill the plan" have almost been replaced by the word "red." Zhou Qinggeng couldn't think of a proper reply for a moment, just wiped the sweat from his face and said, "It's a sure thing!" Turning around, he sent coal to the transportation route again.

	All for "Red"

When we came up from the mine, it was already 10:30 at night. This is the rainy season, and it was drizzling. How sweetly people would sleep on a summer rainy night! But the office of the Fifth Mining Area was as busy as in the daytime, with night shift workers and on-duty cadres walking in and out in a constant stream. Liu Donghe, a worker from the Eighth Mining Team who was going to take over the third shift, came to the office early. His upper garment was soaked by the rain, and his trouser legs were covered with clumps of mud. Director Zhao said to him in a caring tone, "There are still two hours before your shift starts, why don't you sleep a little longer at home?" Liu Donghe said, "I can't sleep because I'm thinking about 'full house red'!" In fact, wasn't Director Zhao also staying up late for this reason!

At this time, the office telephone rang in bursts. Zhao Huachang, the central monitor, was holding the telephone, and communicating with the various mining teams and coal loading stations in the mine. After a while, the telephone rang, saying that Zhou Qinggeng's group in the Eighth Mining Team was "red" again, having completed the plan of one hundred and forty tons ahead of schedule, overproducing fifty tons from the original ninety tons. At this time, the office seemed particularly active. In order to achieve "full house red", "the hearts of the workers and cadres above and below this mining area have been closely linked together."

	Midnight Jubilation

It was midnight, and the club was brightly lit with gongs and drums. The mine Party committee sent an amateur propaganda team to perform a consolation performance for the two hundred and more workers of the third shift of the Fifth Mining Area who were going to go down the mine at 12:30. The first program was "Good News Sent Home" sung by the female winding engine driver Huang Qiufen, and the second program was "Red Every Day at the Beginning of the Month" newly created by Jin Xiufu, a coal miner from the Second Mining Area… The performances and songs were all about the workers' own affairs. The audience below the stage watched with fascination, and forgot that their palms hurt when they applauded.

One of the programs was "Celebrating a Good Start", which performed the deeds of Song Chen's group in the Seventh Mining Team overproducing seventy tons on August 1st and 2nd. While the performance was going on, the person sitting next to Song Chen kept bumping him with his hand, and people sitting farther away from Song Chen also kept giving him respectful glances. This made Song Chen rub his eyes with both hands, and he was a little embarrassed.

As soon as the program was over, Lin Qingyuan, the branch secretary who had just returned from a meeting in the mine and was about to go down the mine with the third shift workers, called on everyone to respond to the consolation of the propaganda team of the mine Party committee with practical actions to strive for "full house red". The workers under the stage were a little excited. Wang Fulin, a worker from the Seventh Mining Team, put his hands on his hips and repeatedly said, "Guarantee red, guarantee red!". Many other people also finished their last cigarette, drank the tea in their cups, rolled up their sleeves and walked out of the club, heading for the inclined shaft. (Attached picture)

　　夜班夺煤记
　　本报记者　王一举
    跨进八月，黑龙江省鹤岗矿务局兴安台煤矿第五采煤区的职工们，正以排山倒海的气魄，向月月超额、季季超产“满堂红”的目标迈进。
        这班更比上班强
    天刚黑，下午四点半接班的第二班采煤工人已经干了三个多小时了。记者同这个采区的区长赵明德来到井下。这里是第七采煤队，站在高处，一眼看去，好像一条笔直的走廊，井井有条的坑木支柱，排成了整齐的行列；矿工们头上的矿灯，随着紧张的劳动操作，光芒四射。挖下的煤炭，沿着溜子，像一泻千里的瀑布，刷刷地泻入煤车。……采煤工人们，正在运用新近学来的平行交叉流水作业法，采煤的、放顶的、支架工、井下运输，一环扣一环，像一架机器，在有节奏地运转着。赵区长告诉我们，采用这个先进经验，就可以做到二十四小时内不间断地出煤。
    我们走到采煤工作面的顶头了。二班组长王玉秀正抡着大镐在刨底煤和他在一起的是齐登云，他们两个都是年龄不相上下的年青人。铁锹在他们手里挥动起来，像一架小电铲，哗哗的浮煤，沿着溜子，向装煤站流过去。
    从第七采煤队往下走几步是全矿闻名的“勇敢青年采煤队”——第八采煤队。其实，这个采煤队不仅很勇敢，而且还有智慧。跨进8月，全矿开展“开门红”运动以来，这个采煤队的三个采煤组，竞赛搞的热火朝天。在这里当班的，是周庆庚小组，这一班原来的班产计划是九十吨，可是他们的上一班丁国栋小组却给他们出了个难题，那一班人足足干了一百零五吨。周庆庚小组哪能服这个软？于是一上班，个个摩拳擦掌，下决心，非要撵过去不行。在他们下井前的班前“诸葛亮”会上，大家一商量，就把这班的小组生产计划提高到一百零四吨。而且说出去就得踏踏实实干出来，这是周庆庚小组的老规矩。你一言，我一语，想出了两条好办法：第一条是“先下手”，两个打眼的，两个放炮的，提前半小时下矿井（也提前半小时收工，并不延长劳动时间），先把运煤溜子安置好，再放上一排炮，接班时间一到，马上就出煤。第二条，用他们的说法叫做“好钢使在刀刃上”，让全组最能干的老工人冯永贵、张贵臣、李福顺几个人连打眼带放炮，捎带搭坑木顶子，都干“刀刃”上的活。当我们走到他们跟前的时候，小组长周庆庚告诉赵区长说：“我们这班下来四小时，就干了十一车！”十一车是六十六吨。可是赵区长还是免不了使个“激将法”。他说“你们若是后面四小时干不好，还是‘红’不了啊！”。原来在这里，“完成计划”和“超额完成计划”的字眼，几乎全被一个‘红’字代替了。周庆庚一时想不出恰当的话来回答，只是擦了一下脸上的汗水，说了声“没跑就是了！”转过身去，又往运输道上送起煤来了。
        都是为了“红”
    我们由井下上来的时候，已经夜晚十点半了。这里正是多雨季节，雨又在淅沥淅沥地下着。盛夏的雨夜，人们会睡得多甜啊！可是第五采煤区办公室里，却和白天一样的忙碌着，走出走进的夜班工人和值班的干部，川流不息。接第三班的工人，第八采煤队工人刘东和却提前来到办公室，他的上衣让雨淋的湿漉漉的，裤腿上挂着一团团泥浆。赵区长用体贴的口吻向他说：“离你接班还有两小时，怎么不在家多睡一会儿？”刘东和说：“心里惦记着‘满堂红’睡也睡不着！”。其实赵区长何尝不也是为了这，才夜不归宿的呀！
    这时候，办公室的电话铃一阵阵地响着，中心班长赵化常，把着电话机，和井下各采煤队、装煤站接连的通着电话。一会儿，电话铃响了，说是第八采煤队周庆庚小组又“红”了，提前完成了一百四十吨的计划，比原订的九十吨超产了五十吨，这时候，办公室里显得格外活跃。为了实现“满堂红”，“已经把这个采煤区井上、井下的工人、干部的心，紧紧地联结在一起了。”
      午夜的欢腾
    正是半夜十二点，俱乐部里灯光通明，锣鼓喧天，矿党委派来了业余宣传队，为这个第五采煤区第三班将要在十二点半下井的二百多名工人做慰问演出来了。第一个节目是绞车女司机黄秋芬唱的“喜报送到家”，第二个节目是二采区采煤工人金秀福新创作的“月初日日红”……。演的、唱的都是工人们自己的事。台下的观众看的入了迷，鼓起掌来忘记了巴掌疼。
    其中还有一个节目是“庆祝开门红”，演的是第七采煤队宋臣小组在8月1日和2日两天超产七十吨的事迹。正在演出的时候，坐在宋臣旁边的人用手直撞他，坐的离宋臣远些的人，也向他直递着尊敬的眼神。这一来，把宋臣弄的两手直揉眼睛，有点发窘了。
    节目一演完，刚由矿里开会回来、又要和第三班工人一起下井的支部书记林清源，号召大家用争取“满堂红”的实际行动，回答矿党委宣传队的慰问。台下的工人们，有点别不住劲了。第七采煤队工人汪福林两手叉着腰，连连地说“保证红，保证红！”。其他许多人，也都狠狠地吸完最后一口香烟，喝完杯子里的茶水，挽起袖子走出俱乐部，奔向斜井去了。（附图片）
