Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd - The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee held a provincial on-site cotton production meeting in Siyang County in late July. The meeting decided to seize the current crucial opportunity for cotton production, earnestly implement six measures, strive for more and larger cotton bolls, and ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest.

The 180 representatives attending the meeting first visited cotton fields in the Siyang County Farm and the Lai'an, Chengxiang, Yanghe, and Cangji People's Communes, exchanging experiences in cotton field management. Everyone agreed that Siyang County had a firm grasp on cotton production, the masses were highly motivated, and field management was meticulous. The cotton grew neatly and vigorously, with many bolls and few falling bolls. The representatives also reported that most cotton plants in various places were growing better than last year, with earlier development, compact plant shapes, more early flowers and bolls, and fewer falling ones. The better-growing cotton plants were already more than two feet tall, with more than ten layers of fruit branches, twenty to thirty flower buds, and three to five bolls. They will begin to fluff in mid-August. Therefore, as long as field management in the middle and late stages is well managed, a bumper harvest is highly promising.

From now until the middle and late of September, the period of little more than a month is the effective boll-forming period for cotton. The amount of cotton that can be produced per mu of cotton field will be determined during this time. During this time, cotton has very strict requirements for nutritional conditions and the growing environment. Any delay or relaxation in cultivation management will have an adverse impact on cotton production. Therefore, the meeting believed that it is necessary to seize this critical time, make field management more timely and meticulous, and resolutely overcome various natural disasters. Based on the current cotton growth, growing habits, and local climate characteristics, the meeting proposed six main measures for current cotton field management: First, apply several top dressings before mid-August to meet the nutrient needs of cotton for growing more buds and forming more bolls. Top dressing should be applied according to the seedlings; those growing poorly should be applied earlier and more; those with cotton bolls already closing ranks and growing vigorously should be applied less or temporarily not applied. Second, comprehensively and thoroughly prevent and control various diseases and insect pests, protect buds and bolls. Third, in areas with drought, timely irrigate or apply water and fertilizer, and at the same time, prepare for flood prevention. Fourth, continue to carry out soil loosening, weeding, and earthing up in cotton fields that have not yet closed ranks. Fifth, reasonably top and prune branches, regulate nutrient supply to cotton plants, and improve ventilation and light transmission in cotton fields. Topping should be carried out in stages according to the season, cotton growth, and soil fertility. Those growing poorly and with thin soil should be topped early, while those growing vigorously and with strong soil should be topped later, but no later than around August 15. Sixth, for cotton fields with missing seedlings or too many seedlings and sparse cotton, apply more fertilizer to cultivate individual plants to achieve the purpose of compensating for sparseness with large plants and forming more cotton bolls. Various places should implement these measures in light of local conditions and seedlings.

The meeting particularly requested that the processing and cultivation of some third-class seedling fields be stepped up, and that the management of scattered cotton fields be strengthened, so as to achieve a comprehensive increase in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 2nd - Early peanuts, the main oil crop in Fujian Province, are growing strong and bearing fruit, showing a scene of bumper harvest. Good news of a bumper harvest has been reported from the southern region, where harvesting is better. The Kezai Production Team of the Qiaodong People's Commune in Zhao'an County recently harvested a piece of 31.7 mu of peanuts, which, after drying, yielded an average of more than double the amount per mu compared to last year.

This year, Fujian Province planted a total of more than 1.2 million mu of early peanuts, which is more than 140,000 mu more than the planting area of ​​both early and late peanuts last year. In order to strive for a bumper peanut harvest, farmers in various places have adopted a series of advanced measures from planting to management, in accordance with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Fuqing County, one of the main peanut-producing areas, appropriately advanced planting during peanut sowing, applied sufficient base fertilizer, and used calcium superphosphate and rhizobium to mix seeds, ensuring vigorous seedling growth. In field management, many communes have organized cadres and members to manage specific areas. Various localities have also used medicines and machinery to timely prevent and eliminate the harm of cutworms, aphids, and wilt, etc., according to the main diseases and insect pests that are prone to occur in the early, middle, and late stages of peanut growth, so that the vast majority of early peanut areas have been growing well.

At present, various localities are appropriately postponing harvesting according to climatic and seasonal conditions, extending the growing period, promoting more full peanut kernels, and increasing the oil content, while timely harvesting and carefully collecting mature peanuts to strive for every grain of the bumper harvest to be returned to the granary.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 2nd - People's communes in jute-producing areas of Zhejiang Province are strengthening the late-stage management of jute to strive for tall jute stalks, thick stems, and thick bark.

Zhejiang Province is a major jute-producing area in my country. The province's 600,000 mu of jute is already a verdant and vigorous scene. According to the recent field inspection results of various commune in jute areas, about 40% of the first-class hemp grows seven to eight feet tall, and a few reach about ten feet; about 45% of the second-class hemp is currently taller than people; only 15% of the third-class hemp grows poorly due to late sowing and little base fertilizer, and special management is needed.

At present, communes in jute areas are topdressing, watering, and pest control in jute fields. Communes in the suburbs of Hangzhou City and Xiaoshan and Haining counties have put forward the need to vigorously attack the three key aspects of fertilizer, water, and pests in the month before jute harvest, striving for high yields per mu, according to the unbalanced growth of jute.

Due to high temperatures and little rainfall along both banks of the Qiantang River in the past half month, some jute fields have shown signs of drought. Commune members have set up waterwheels and water pumps to draw water day and night to fight drought. The jute that has been irrigated in time grows taller and its branches and leaves are luxuriant.

Communes in various jute areas have also launched competitions to exceed contracted production and exceed plans. (Attached picture)

    据新华社南京2日电　中共江苏省委7月下旬在泗阳县召开全省棉花生产现场会议，决定抓住当前棉花生产的关键时机，认真贯彻六项措施，力争棉花桃多桃大，确保全面丰收。
    参加会议的一百八十名代表首先参观了泗阳县农场和来安、城厢、洋河、仓集等人民公社的棉花，交流了棉田管理经验。大家认为，泗阳县对棉花生产抓得紧，群众干劲大，田间管理精细，棉花生长整齐健壮，结桃多，掉桃少。到会代表同时也反映，今年各地棉花大部分长得比去年好，棉花发育早，株形紧凑、初期花结桃多、落的少。现在生长较好的棉株已有两尺多高，十多层果枝，二十到三十个花蕾，结铃三个到五个，8月中旬就将开始吐絮。因此，只要抓好中后期田间管理，丰收大有希望。
    从现在起到9月上中旬的一个多月内，是棉花的有效结铃期，每亩棉田能产多少棉花，都将在这个时间内决定。在此时间，棉花对营养条件和生长环境的要求十分严格，栽培管理如稍有迟误或放松一着，都对棉花产量有不利的影响。因此，会议认为必须紧紧抓住这个关键时间，把田间管理工作做得更及时、更精细，坚决战胜各种自然灾害。根据目前棉花的长势、生长习惯和当地气候特点，会议提出了当前棉田管理的六项主要措施：第一，在8月中旬之前要施几次追肥，满足棉花多长蕾多结铃的养分需要。追肥要看苗施用，生长差的要早施多施；棉桃已封行长势旺盛的少施或暂时不施。第二，全面地彻底地防治各种病虫害，保蕾保铃。第三，对有伏旱的地要及时浇水或追施水肥，同时要作好防涝准备工作。第四，未封行的棉田要继续做好中耕锄草和培地工作。第五，合理摘心整枝，调节棉株养分供应，改善棉田通风透光环境。摘心要根据季节、棉花长势、土壤肥力等情况分次进行，生长差地力薄的早打，生长旺地力壮的迟打，但不迟于8月15日左右。第六，对缺苗多苗又稀的棉田，要多施一些肥料培植单株，达到以大补稀多结棉桃的目的。各地要因地因苗制宜地贯彻这些措施。
    会议特别要求对一部分三类苗田抓紧加工培植和对零星分散的棉田加强管理，以便做到全面增产。
    据新华社福州2日电　福建省主要油料作物早花生大都长得苗壮果实，开始成熟，呈现一片丰收景象。收获较好的南部地区已传出丰收喜讯。诏安县桥东公社甲游大队柯仔生产队最近收获的一片三十一亩七分多花生，经过翻晒，平均每亩产量比去年增加一倍多。
    今年，福建省共种早花生一百二十多万亩，比去年早晚两季花生播种面积还多十四万多亩。为了力争花生丰收，各地农民根据农业“八字宪法”的要求，从种到管，采取了一系列的先进措施。花生主要产区之一的福清县，在花生播种时，适当提早种植，施足基肥，采用过磷酸钙、根瘤菌拌种，保证了幼苗生长旺壮。在田间管理上，许多公社都组织干部和社员，分片专责管理。各地还根据花生生长初期、中期和后期容易发生的主要病虫害情况，用药械等及时防治和扑灭了地老虎、蚜虫和枯萎病等的危害，使绝大部分地区的早花生一直生长良好。
    现在，各地正根据气候和季节条件，一方面适当推迟收获，延长生长期，促进花生结实更加饱满，提高含油率，一方面对已经成熟的花生，及时进行抢收和细收拣净，力争丰收的果实粒粒归仓。
    据新华社杭州2日电　浙江省产麻区各人民公社加强黄麻后期管理，力争黄麻杆高、茎粗、皮厚。
    浙江省是我国主要黄麻产区。全省六十万亩黄麻已经是一片葱绿，生长旺盛。据最近各麻区公社田间检查结果，约占40％的一类麻，长得株高七、八尺，少数达到一丈左右；约占45％的二类麻，目前也株高过人；只有15％的三类麻，由于播种迟、基肥少，生长较差，特别需要加强管理。
    目前，麻区各公社正给麻田追肥、浇水、治虫。杭州市郊和萧山县、海宁县各公社，根据黄麻生长不够平衡的情况，提出要在黄麻收获前的一个月内，猛攻肥、水、虫三关，力争亩亩高产。
    钱塘江两岸半个月来由于气温高、雨量少，部分麻田呈现旱象，社员们已架起水车、抽水机，日夜戽水抗旱，及时得到灌溉的黄麻天天长高，枝叶并茂。
    各麻区公社还开展了超包产、超规划竞赛。（附图片）
