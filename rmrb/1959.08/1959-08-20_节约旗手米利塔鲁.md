　　Militaru, Standard-Bearer of Thrift
　　By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    A few days ago, we visited the "Nicolae Bălcescu" shoe factory in Bucharest. Dozens of male and female workers in the leather cutting workshop were busy with production. We stopped in front of an old worker from the "Pornard Andrei" production team. He was holding a leather cutting knife, carefully examining a glossy piece of leather. His expression was like an artist contemplating a painting before starting. Clearly, he was considering how to use this piece of leather most economically. After he made up his mind, his cutting knife danced along the patterns of several shoe styles. In the blink of an eye, a piece of leather had been cut into pieces of shoe material, neatly stacked on the workbench. The leather he had left was just shreds; there was nothing usable left.
    Who was this skillful craftsman? The factory's Party branch secretary introduced him to us as Militaru, a nationally famous leather cutter in Romania.
    After Militaru introduced his working methods to us, he said, "Before, when working for the capitalists, no one talked about thrift. They would just pull out a piece of leather, follow the pattern, and imitate it. Now it's different. If everyone doesn't engage in increasing production and practicing thrift, it will be impossible to build socialism. The recent national wage increase would also be impossible."
    Militaru is the factory's thrift expert. This year, from January to July, the leather he saved was enough to make six hundred and sixty pairs of shoes. He had automatically requested to lead this production team, which was lagging behind in thrift, just six days ago.
    The "November 7th" production team, which Militaru previously led, saved an average of about fifty square meters of leather each month. However, this production team that he now leads only saved seven square meters of leather each month in the past. That is to say, this team unconsciously cut hundreds of pairs of shoe materials that should have been saved into useless strips and pieces and threw them away each month. Thinking about this, who wouldn't feel sorry! This is why Militaru automatically requested to lead this production team.
    After hearing about the advanced Soviet female worker Gaganova leading lagging workers to catch up with advanced ones, Militaru asked the factory Party organization and administration to send him to lead the "Pornard Andrei" production team, which saved the least material. He guaranteed to help this production team reach the level of advanced production teams in saving materials.
    His request was approved, and all the workers in the team warmly welcomed Militaru, the experienced master craftsman with more than thirty years of experience. Only the original team leader, Grama Florica, was initially somewhat unhappy. This young woman felt ashamed for not leading the team well. She is now working diligently opposite Militaru. She said that she was very happy that Militaru came to be the team leader because it would enable their production team to save more leather.
    Militaru often demonstrates and explains his working methods to his new apprentices, provides guidance during work, and conducts inspections and evaluations after work. The work of this production team has undergone tremendous changes immediately after his arrival. In five days, they saved 9.74 square meters of leather, which is more than they saved in the past month. A team member with outstanding achievements is Ursa Ion. Under Militaru's guidance, he realized his first savings ever.
    The news of Militaru leading a lagging production team was announced and received a warm response from many industrial and mining enterprises across the country. An unprecedented movement of leading the lagging to catch up with the advanced has now been launched. In this movement, many excellent production team leaders have volunteered to lead lagging production teams, and some advanced production teams have volunteered to help lagging production teams. Their common goal is to make progress together and build socialism faster.
    Militaru, who came from a poor peasant background, did not become famous today. As early as 1953, he was famous both at home and abroad. At that time, like now, he put forward an extremely important initiative to the shoe-making workers of the whole country. His initiative was: "Save leather as much as possible and produce more shoes!" At the same time, he also put forward several rationalization proposals. For example, he suggested that large and small patterns should be used together when cutting materials – to make the best use of the leather material; the blade of the cutting knife should be shortened – so that it is not easy to hurt the hand, nor is it easy to accidentally injure the leather; the workbench should be tilted ten to fifteen degrees – so that it is clear and easy to work.
    After Militaru's initiative was put forward, thirty-two shoe factories across the country immediately responded, and a warm savings competition began. This competition has been going on from that time to the present and has formed a tradition of thrift in the shoe-making industry. By 1957, these enterprises had saved 20 million lei for the country.
    Since Militaru put forward the initiative of saving to the whole country, the factory where he is located has achieved excellent results in saving materials. Before 1953, this factory needed 0.13 to 0.16 square meters of leather to make a pair of shoes, and now an average of ten pairs of shoes can be made per square meter of leather.
    Militaru's initiative to save in 1953 not only received a wide response in Romania, but also aroused the attention of counterparts in the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary. In these countries, many shoe-making workers also adopted his advanced working methods, and some also sent delegations to Romania to exchange experiences.
    Due to his great contribution in advocating thrift, Militaru was awarded the third-class "Labor Medal" issued by the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly in 1954. However, he is not satisfied with his achievements. He often looks for advanced working methods in newspapers and books, and goes to shoe stores to study the cutting of shoes. His wish is to achieve maximum savings. He believes that there is still great potential that has not been realized.
    Militaru started as an apprentice in a shoe store at the age of fifteen, and was beaten by the boss a lot, but he did not learn any skills. After liberation, he joined the Party in 1945, and the Party sent him to a technical school to study, where he learned real skills. Therefore, he now pays great attention to training young workers. In the past five years, more than sixty young workers have become skilled workers or advanced workers under his guidance. (Attached picture)

### 节约旗手米利塔鲁

　　节约旗手米利塔鲁
　　本报记者　魏凌冰
    前几天我们访问了布加勒斯特的“尼古拉·巴尔切斯库”制鞋厂。在皮鞋剪裁车间里数十名男女工人都正忙于生产。我们在“波尔纳德·安德烈”生产队的一位老工人面前停下来。他正在手执裁皮刀打量着一张油光光的皮革。他那神色就好像一个艺术家在绘画前构思布局一样。显然，他是在考虑怎样最节约地利用这张皮子。在他看定以后，他的裁皮刀就按着几种皮鞋样板挥舞起来。转眼间，一张皮革已经被裁成一块块的皮鞋料子，整整齐齐地叠在工作台上。他裁剩的皮子已是丝丝缕缕，再也没有成材的东西了。
    这个天工巧匠到底是谁？工厂的党支部书记向我们介绍说，他就是罗马尼亚全国闻名的裁皮工米利塔鲁。
    米利塔鲁向我们介绍了他的工作方法后说：“以前给资本家干活没有谁讲节约，都是拉过一张皮子，按着样板，依样画葫芦。现在可不同了，如果大家都不搞增产节约，就无法建设社会主义，最近全国增加工资也是不可能的。”
    米利塔鲁是全厂的节约能手。今年他从1月份到7月份节约的皮革能做六百六十双皮鞋。他是在六天前自动要求来领导这个在节约方面落后的生产队的。
    米利塔鲁以前领导的“十一月七日”生产队，平均每月节约五十平方米左右的皮革。但是，他现在领导的这个生产队，过去每月只能节约七平方米皮革，也就是说，这个队每月都把应该节约下来的数百双皮鞋料子，不知不觉地裁成无用的条条块块丢掉了。算算这笔账，有谁不感到可惜！这就是米利塔鲁自动要求来领导这个生产队的原因。
    米利塔鲁在听到苏联的先进女工加干诺娃带后进赶先进的事迹后，就要求工厂党组织和行政派他来领导节约材料最少的“波尔纳德·安德烈”生产队。他保证帮助这个生产队达到先进生产队节约材料的水平。
    他的要求被批准了，全队的工人都热烈欢迎米利塔鲁这个有三十多年工作经验的老师傅，只有原来的队长格拉玛·弗洛里卡起初有些不愉快。原来这个年青姑娘由于没有把这个队领导好而感到惭愧。她现在就在米利塔鲁的对面紧张地工作。她说，她对米利塔鲁来当队长很高兴，因为能使他们的生产队节约更多的皮革。
    米利塔鲁经常向他的新徒弟们表演和讲解他的工作方法，在工作时随时指导，在工作结束后进行检查和评比。这个生产队的工作在他来后立刻发生了巨大变化，五天中就节约了九点七四平方米皮革，比他们过去一个月中节约的还要多。有突出成绩的队员是乌尔沙·伊昂。他在米利塔鲁的指导下，破天荒实现了第一次节约。
    米利塔鲁领导落后生产队的消息一公布，就得到了全国各地许多工矿企业的热烈响应，现在已经掀起了一个带后进赶先进的空前未有的运动。在这个运动中，有许多优秀的生产队长自愿去领导落后生产队，也有些先进的生产队自愿去帮助落后生产队，他们的共同目的是使大家一起进步，更快地建设社会主义。
    贫农出身的米利塔鲁并不是从今天开始出名的，早在1953年就名闻国内外了。他那时也像现在一样，向全国制鞋工人提出了一项极其重要的倡议。他的倡议是：“尽量节约皮革，生产更多的皮鞋！”他同时还提出了几项合理化建议。例如，他建议在裁料时要大小样板搭配使用——尽量利用皮料；把裁皮刀的刀刃改短——这样既不易伤手，也不易误伤皮子；使工作台面倾斜十度到十五度——这样看得清楚，便于工作。
    米利塔鲁的倡议提出后，全国有三十二个制鞋厂立即响应，一场热烈的节约竞赛就开始了。这个竞赛运动从那时到现在一直在进行，并且形成了制鞋工业的节约传统。到1957年为止，这些企业已经为国家节约了两千万列伊。
    自从米利塔鲁向全国提出节约倡议后，他所在的工厂在节约材料方面获得了优异的成绩。在1953年以前，这个工厂做一双皮鞋需要用零点一三到零点一六平方米皮革，现在每平方米皮革平均可以做十双皮鞋了。
    米利塔鲁在1953年提出的节约倡议，不但在罗马尼亚获得广泛的响应，而且也引起了苏联、波兰、保加利亚和匈牙利等国的同行们的注意。在这些国家中，许多制鞋工人也采用了他的先进工作方法，有的还派了代表团到罗马尼亚来交流经验。
    由于在提倡节约方面有很大功绩，米利塔鲁在1954年获得了大国民议会主席团所发的三级“劳动勋章”。但是，他并不满足于自己的成绩。他经常在报纸和书本中寻找先进工作方法，到皮鞋店里去研究皮鞋的剪裁。他的愿望是实现最大限度的节约。他认为还有很大潜力没有发挥。
    米利塔鲁从十五岁起当皮鞋店的学徒，挨了老板不少的鞭打，却没有学到什么手艺。解放后，他在1945年入了党，党送他到一个技术学校去学习，他在那里才学到了真正的技术。因此，他现在很注意培养青年工人。最近五年来已有六十多名青年工人在他的教导下成为熟练工人或先进工作者了。（附图片）
