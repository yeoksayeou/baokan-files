    Holiday
    The young accountant is fishing by the Clear Water River, the old head of the commune is hunting birds in the bamboo forest, the amateur cultural troupe is rehearsing a new play, and the athletes are jumping and bouncing on the sports field. Who is singing a folk song on the hillside? Who is singing a ditty by the well? The auntie in the cafeteria is chopping vegetables while listening, they want everyone to eat well! The Party Secretary is also in high spirits, taking his family through the forest path. They walked into a small village where children are laughing in their mothers' arms. The guests are warmly received, and the Secretary shakes hands and greets the masses with cordiality. They are like relatives and friends, chatting and joking with each other. When it gets dark, people come from all directions, the lights in the square are as bright as day, and shadows sway; on the stage, there is a burst of blowing and beating, a burst of playing and singing, and the joyful mood is like the undulating waves. The actors perform well, and the singing is wonderful, the children are happy to whistle, and the stars and the moon are also watching the show. The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl like such excitement the most. Brother Cowherd and Sister Weaver Girl, please go and see somewhere else! There is also a group of young people who are more active, welcome you two to join their dance!

    假日
    放平小会计在清水河边垂钓，老社长在斑竹林里打鸟，业余文工团在排练新戏，运动员在球场蹦蹦跳跳。是谁在山坡上唱山歌？是谁在井头上唱小调？食堂里的大娘边听边剁着菜
  刀，她们要叫大伙儿吃得很好！党委书记的兴致也不小，带着全家穿过了林间小道，他们走进了一个小村庄，那里的孩子正在妈妈怀里欢
  笑。客人们受到殷勤的接待，书记和群众亲切地握手问好，他们像亲戚又像朋友，互相谈谈心，也开开玩笑。天黑了，人们从四面八方来了，广场上灯光如昼，人影摇摇；台子上一阵吹打，一阵弹唱，欢悦的心情像起伏的波涛。演员演得好，唱也唱得妙，孩子们乐得吹起了口哨，星星和月亮也在看戏，牛郎和织女最喜欢这样的热
  闹。牛郎哥哥织女姐，请到另一处去瞧瞧！还有一群年青人更加活跃，欢迎你俩参加他们的舞蹈！
