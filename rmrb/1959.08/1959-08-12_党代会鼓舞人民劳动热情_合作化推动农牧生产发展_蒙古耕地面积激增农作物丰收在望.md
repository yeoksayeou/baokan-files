Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 10th: Our correspondent reports: In the first half of this year, significant changes have taken place in agricultural and livestock production in the Mongolian People's Republic: the cultivated area has expanded by 45.8% compared to last year; crop production is very good, and a bumper harvest is expected; livestock breeding is better than in previous years.

Mongolian sources here believe that these achievements are of great significance for completing the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) and accelerating Mongolia's socialist construction.

In the first half of this year, Mongolia carried out an unprecedentedly large-scale land reclamation effort. To date, more than 110,000 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed, which is equivalent to about 80% of the area previously cultivated. Most agricultural and pastoral farms have overfulfilled their land reclamation plans.

This year's sown area reached more than 150,000 hectares. After land reclamation, the cultivated area of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, which have always focused on animal husbandry, has doubled compared to last year.

This year, Mongolia's five types of livestock (cattle, horses, camels, goats, and sheep) have collectively bred 7,169,000 young animals, an increase of more than 500,000 compared to 1958. The quality and utilization of livestock products are also better than in previous years.

When interviewed by our reporter about the reasons for the above achievements, the person in charge of the Mongolian Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry pointed out that the important instructions made by the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (1958) and the Central Plenary Session in March of this year on developing agricultural and animal husbandry production have greatly inspired the labor enthusiasm of the working people. Now, all individual herdsmen have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. Individual herdsmen who have been scattered and nomadic for generations have become members of the collective economy. The cooperative has become a socialist economic unit, which facilitates organized and planned production. This is an important reason for the achievements in agricultural and animal husbandry production in the first half of this year.

The person in charge also said that another reason for the achievements in agriculture and animal husbandry is the growing assistance from socialist countries. Various fraternal countries have helped Mongolia develop agricultural and livestock production in terms of machinery and technology. This year, the Soviet Union sent more than 300 experts to help with land reclamation and agricultural production. In addition, the Mongolian Party and government have also taken concrete measures to train agricultural and animal husbandry technical cadres, improve livestock feeding and management, and strengthen veterinary work, all of which contribute to the development of production. The unprecedented expansion of land reclamation and the great development of agricultural production in Mongolia this year are regarded as a major turning point in the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production in Mongolia. Such a large-scale agricultural production has never been seen in Mongolia before.

According to the current survey and land reclamation situation, by 1960, the national cultivated area may reach 300,000 hectares, and the day is not far off when Mongolia will produce enough grain to meet its own needs for flour.

### 党代会鼓舞人民劳动热情　合作化推动农牧生产发展　蒙古耕地面积激增农作物丰收在望

　　党代会鼓舞人民劳动热情　合作化推动农牧生产发展
　　蒙古耕地面积激增农作物丰收在望
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　本社记者报道：今年上半年，蒙古人民共和国农牧业生产发生了重大的变化：耕地面积比去年扩大了45.8％；农作物生产情况十分良好，丰收在望；牲畜的增殖情况比往年好。
    这里的蒙古人士认为，这些成绩对于完成三年计划（1958年——1960年）、加快蒙古的社会主义建设有重大的意义。
    今年上半年，蒙古进行了空前大规模的开荒工作，到目前为止，已经开出了十一万多公顷的荒地，这相当于过去耕种面积的80％左右。大部分农牧场都超额完成了开荒计划。
    今年的播种面积达到了十五万多公顷。在开荒以后，过去一向以牧业生产为主的农牧业合作社的耕种面积比去年增加了一倍。
    今年蒙古五种牲畜（牛、马、骆驼、山羊、绵羊）共增殖了七百一十六万九千头的幼畜，比1958年增加了五十多万头。牧畜产品的质量和利用情况也比往年好。
    蒙古农牧业部负责人对本社记者谈取得上述成就的原因时指出，蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会
  （1958年）和今年3月中央全会对发展农牧业生产作出的重要指示，大大地鼓舞了劳动人民的劳动热情。现在，个体牧民已全部加入了农牧业合作社。世世代代分散游牧的个体牧民成了集体经济的成员。合作社成为社会主义经济单位，就便于有组织、有计划地进行生产。这是今年上半年农牧业生产取得成就的重要原因。
    这位负责人又说，农牧业取得成就的另一个原因是，社会主义国家日益增长的帮助。各兄弟国家曾在机器技术方面帮助蒙古发展农牧业生产。今年苏联派了三百多名专家来帮助开荒和发展农业生产。此外，蒙古党和政府还在培养农牧业技术干部、改进牲畜的饲养管理和加强兽医工作等方面采取了具体措施，这些都有助于生产的发展。今年蒙古开荒面积的空前扩大和农业生产的大发展，被看作是蒙古农牧业生产发展的重大转折。这样规模巨大的农业生产在蒙古是从来没有过的。
    据目前调查和开荒的情况看来，到1960年，全国耕种面积可能达到三十万公顷，蒙古生产粮食满足自己对面粉需要的日子已经为时不远了。
