　　From dilapidated light industrial factories in the past to a large number of modern enterprises today
　　Wuhan strides towards becoming an industrial base
　　(Our newspaper dispatch) Wuhan, a major city in Central China, has made tremendous achievements in industrial construction over the past decade. Hundreds of industrial enterprises have been newly built, expanded, or renovated and completed. Dozens of key projects are under construction. At present, a rudimentary metallurgical and machine-building industrial base, centered on large factories such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, is taking shape.
　　Historically, Wuhan, known as the "thoroughfare of nine provinces," was essentially a semi-colonial and semi-feudal consumer city, a stronghold for imperialist and bureaucratic comprador capital to plunder the urban and rural people of several provinces in Central China. For a long time, industry was declining, and people were living in misery. On the eve of liberation, the city had only more than 400 dilapidated medium and small factories, including textiles, flour, rice milling, oil refining, soap, machine repair, and public utilities. After liberation, through a short period of economic recovery and construction during the First Five-Year Plan, Wuhan has successively established several new industrial areas such as Qingshan and Hongshan. With the renovation and expansion of existing factories, Wuhan has now become a socialist industrial city with several million people.
　　Now, Wuhan has begun to have some major factories and enterprises. These include a metallurgical industry with Wuhan Iron and Steel as its backbone; a machinery and shipbuilding industry with Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant and Wuchang Shipyard as its backbone; an electrical machinery industry with the Guanshan Steam Turbine and Turbine Generator Factory and Wuhan Boiler Factory as its backbone; a pharmaceutical industry mainly composed of Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory and Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory; a building materials industry mainly composed of the soon-to-be-completed Wuhan Cement Plant; a textile industry mainly composed of the original five textile mills, the newly built Wuhan Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory, and the Guomian No. 2 Factory under construction; and light industries such as Hankou Meat Joint Processing Plant and Hanyang Paper Mill. In addition, chemical factories are also under construction. Last year, due to the implementation of the policy of the whole party and the whole people running industry, many small industries were newly established throughout the city.
　　Among these industrial enterprises, there are key national factories. Wuhan Iron and Steel Company is one of China's three major iron and steel bases. After its completion, it will have the largest blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces in China, like Anshan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel, and will continuously supply raw materials for shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, machine manufacturing and the construction sector. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, a universal heavy-duty machine tool plant built with the latest Soviet technological achievements, can produce 17 specifications of machine tools. Each of these machine tools weighs from tens to hundreds of tons, and the largest ones are almost as tall as three-story buildings.
　　The rapid advance of industrial construction in the Wuhan area has promoted tremendous changes in Wuhan's appearance. For example, after the No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel were put into production, they changed the situation that Wuhan could not produce iron, and it became a city with an annual output of hundreds of thousands of tons of pig iron. Wuhan Iron and Steel's pig iron strongly supported the machinery manufacturing and steelmaking production of Shanghai, Chongqing, and other cities in last year's and this year's production leap forward. The first phase of the Qingshan Thermal Power Plant has been completed, and its power generation capacity is equivalent to 75% of the city's original power generation capacity. After the completion of fourteen workshops of the four factories in the Guanshan electromechanical industrial zone, the steam turbine and turbine generator factory, integrated motor factory, blower factory, and bearing factory, have produced larger transformers and more precise bearings. The city's metallurgical and mechanical equipment manufacturing capacity has also been greatly improved. Last year, the proportion of the production of means of production in the city's total industrial output value increased from 36% in 1957 to 45.4%.
　　This year, important projects such as the Wuhan Casting and Forging Center Plant, Marine Machinery Plant, and Wuhan Boiler Plant are under construction. At present, the builders of Wuhan's industrial zones are working with soaring enthusiasm to complete various construction projects in a faster, better, and more economical way. (Attached picture)

　　昔日只有破烂的轻工业工厂　今天建成大批现代化企业
　　武汉向工业基地迈进
    本报讯　我国华中的大城市——武汉，十年来工业建设成绩巨大。新建、扩建、改建完工的工业企业有几百个。正在建设的重点项目有几十个。现在，以武汉钢铁公司、武汉重型机床厂等大型工厂为中心的、一个冶金、机械工业基地的雏型正在形成。
    历史上的武汉，号称“九省通衢”，实质上是一个半殖民地半封建性的消费城市，是帝国主义和官僚买办资本掠夺华中几省城乡人民的一个据点。长期以来，工业雕零，民不聊生。解放前夕，全市只有纺织、面粉、碾米、炼油、肥皂、机器修配和公用事业等破破烂烂的中、小工厂四百余家。解放后，经过短期的经济恢复和第一个五年计划期间的建设，武汉市先后建立起青山、洪山等几个新的工业区，加上原有工厂的改建、扩建，现在武汉市已经成为拥有几百万人口的社会主义工业城市了。
    现在，武汉市开始拥有了一些主要的工厂企业。其中有以武钢为骨干的冶金工业；有以武汉重型机床厂、武昌造船厂等为骨干的机械和造船工业；有以关山的汽轮机和汽轮发电机厂、武汉锅炉厂为骨干的电机工业；有以武汉制药厂、久安制药厂等为主的制药工业；有以即将建成的武汉水泥厂为主的建筑材料工业；有以原有的五个纺织厂、新建成的武汉天一印染厂和正在建设的国棉二厂等为主的纺织工业；还有汉口肉类联合加工厂、汉阳造纸厂等轻工业。另外还有化工厂等正在建设。去年，由于贯彻了全党全民办工业的方针，全市还新办起许多小型工业。
    在这些工业企业中，有国家的重点工厂。武汉钢铁公司是我国三大钢铁基地之一，它建成后同鞍钢和包钢一样，拥有我国目前最大的高炉和平炉，将源源不断地供应船舶、车辆、机器制造等工业和建筑部门以原材料。采用苏联最新技术成就建设的万能性的重型机床厂——武汉重型机床厂可以生产十七种规格的机床。这些机床每台重达几十吨到一百几十吨，最大的差不多有三层楼房那样高。
    武汉地区工业建设的快速前进，促成了武汉面貌的巨大改变。例如，武钢一号、二号高炉投入生产以后，改变了武汉市不能炼铁的状况，而成为年产几十万吨生铁的城市了。武钢的生铁在去年和今年的生产跃进中，有力地支援了上海、重庆等城市的机械制造和炼钢生产。青山热电厂第一期工程已经完成，它的发电能力相当于全市原有发电能力的75％。关山机电工业区的汽轮机和汽轮发电机厂、综合电机厂、鼓风机厂和轴承厂等四个厂的十四个车间建成以后，已经生产出较大的变压器和较精密的轴承。全市冶金、机械设备制造能力也大大提高。去年全市生产资料的生产占工业总产值的比重已由1957年的36％上升到45.4％。
    今年，武汉铸锻中心厂、船用机器厂和武汉锅炉厂等重要工程正在建设。现在，武汉各工业区的建设者正以冲天干劲，争取多快好省地完成各项建设工程。（附图片）
