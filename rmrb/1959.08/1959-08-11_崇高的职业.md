　　Noble Profession
　　By our reporters Ye Shitao and Zhou Shenglin
          Manager, Service Worker
    We turned off the bustling Fuzhou Road (formerly known as Sima Road) into an alley opposite a large hospital and found the Health Hotel.

    It was an ordinary afternoon in June, with unusually sultry weather. The scorching sun nearly melted the asphalt road under our feet; however, upon entering the Health Hotel's guest room, we immediately felt a refreshing coolness. Several white iron beds were arranged side by side, and several guests were lying on the beds reading and resting. The guest room was quiet, with only a female service worker of medium height, dressed in white, busy in one corner. She had just finished wiping the windows and doors and was bending over to wash the mats for the guests with cool water. We stood at the door for a while, watching her wipe each mat, occasionally wiping the sweat from her forehead, and sometimes exchanging a word or two with the guests beside her. "Do you wash them like this every day?" we asked, stepping forward. She nodded with a smile.

    She is Zou Guozhen, the manager of the Health Hotel.

    The Health Hotel is a special kind of hotel. It is a hotel in that it provides accommodation for guests from other places; but it is different from ordinary hotels, because the guests who come here mostly have some ailments: some suffer from chronic illnesses that do not require hospitalization, some have just undergone surgery and need short-term recuperation, and some are farmers from the distant suburbs who come to Shanghai for medical treatment and stay for a night or two if they cannot return the same day. Zou Guozhen has been the manager here since the hotel opened last October. She not only manages the hotel well, but also, like a service worker, cleans the rooms, serves tea and water, and even does laundry, buys groceries, and cooks meals. If we hadn't been introduced, we wouldn't have guessed that she was the manager!
        Everything for the Guests
    Guests who are sick have higher and more numerous demands than ordinary guests. Take diet, for example. Not only do Southerners and Northerners have different tastes, but some patients also need to eat special things. For example, patients with kidney disease cannot eat salty foods, those with stomach problems should eat more pasta, and some guests can only eat thin porridge. Zou Guozhen always tries her best to make them eat happily and satisfactorily. During the "May Day" holiday, her husband bought her three apples to quench her thirst during the parade, but she remembered that a guest wanted to eat apples, so she left them for him. Zou Guozhen always treats the guests with such enthusiasm and care. She tries her best to do whatever the guests need, without ever getting annoyed. One day, a guest suddenly had a stomach attack and kept vomiting. Zou Guozhen and another service worker brought him water, bought medicine, emptied the sputum cup, and cooked thin porridge for him, busy all morning. The guest was so moved that he thanked them repeatedly. Usually, when some guests are unhappy, she goes to talk to them, tell jokes; when some guests receive letters from home but cannot write back themselves, she takes the initiative to write for them. If a guest is too sick to eat by themselves, she feeds them spoonful by spoonful.

    On a table in the hotel's lobby, we saw a medicine box containing thermometers, alcohol, cotton swabs, and various common medicines. The Health Hotel is equipped with a medicine box. It turns out that this female manager is not only a service worker, but also a nurse! Now, she has learned general nursing skills from doctors and nurses.
        Reluctant to Part
    Zou Guozhen treats the guests as family, and the guests also treat Zou Guozhen as family. Many touching stories have thus arisen between them.

    One afternoon in March, a pedicab appeared at the entrance of the Health Hotel—bringing a young guest with crippled legs.

    This young man's name is Zhou Jinming. He is a worker from a geological exploration team in Hunan Province. Not long ago, Zhou Jinming was injured in the legs during a blasting operation, and both legs were amputated at the knees. The young man lost his smile from then on. The leadership specially sent someone from a thousand miles away to take him to Shanghai for treatment and to fit prosthetic legs.

    Zhou Jinming was depressed during the first few days of his stay at the hotel. Whenever his nerves ached, he would sigh and say, "It's over, what work can I do without legs?" Zou Guozhen was very anxious when she heard this. Understanding the feelings of a disabled person, she often comforted him: "Xiao Zhou, you're wrong to say that! Even if your body is disabled, as long as your mind isn't disabled, you are still a useful person. Once you have your prosthetic legs fitted, you won't be able to do heavy work, but you can still do light work. No matter what you do, you are working for the Party." Zou Guozhen often told him stories about Wu Yunduo and other heroes, encouraging him to overcome difficulties.

    From Zou Guozhen's care, Zhou Jinming felt a sense of closeness and warmth. The young man gradually became cheerful, and a smile appeared on his face.

    One night, Zhou Jinming's wound suddenly began to hurt. Zou Guozhen carried him alone on her back to Renji Hospital across the street for emergency treatment. As Zhou Jinming's leg injury slowly healed, Zou Guozhen often carried him on her back to the lobby to play chess and cards with other guests, and showed him picture books for entertainment; sometimes, she even asked someone to accompany Zhou Jinming in a pedicab to the "Great World" amusement park for fun.

    Two months later, Zhou Jinming had his prosthetic legs fitted and was preparing to go back. Zou Guozhen bought his train ticket in advance, accompanied him to the train station, and saw him onto the train; she repeatedly urged the train attendant to take good care of him along the way. At the time of parting, Zhou Jinming was so grateful that he couldn't speak. He held Zou Guozhen's hand tightly for a long time, reluctant to part...

    They became close friends. After Zhou Jinming returned to Hunan, he often wrote to tell her about his life. Not long ago, he wrote to say that his crutches were broken and asked her to buy a new pair for him. Zou Guozhen bought the crutches and went to the post office, train station, and many other places, but could not send them. Finally, she found a procurement agent from Hunan Province stationed in Shanghai, who brought them to Zhou Jinming.
        Determined to Do It for Life
    Zou Guozhen is only thirty-four years old this year. She used to be an ordinary housewife. She joined the hotel as a service worker six years ago. Over the years, she has deeply fallen in love with this line of work. She told us in a proud tone: She is determined to do it for life.

    "The more I do this job, the more interesting I find it," she said. "The guests who come to us are either workers, farmers, or government cadres. When they come, they are mostly frowning, but after staying for a period of time, they go back happily. Seeing them become healthy and able to participate in construction again, I feel as happy as they do."

    The guests are gone, but the service workers' hard work will always remain in their hearts.

    We opened the hotel's suggestion book and saw pages filled with emotional words, praising the ordinary service work. We also saw a large pile of letters of commendation and big-character posters, mostly written by guests after returning to their posts. They said: "Staying with you for a few days is like attending a vivid lesson." They said: "Receiving such good care at your place is the happiness brought to us by the Party." They said: "When we think of your service spirit at work, our confidence in overcoming difficulties becomes even greater."...

    Every compliment and commendation is an encouragement and spur to Zou Guozhen. She said:

      "I have only done some things that should be done. I never thought it would have such a big impact on the Party and the country. Thinking of this, I will serve the guests even more thoughtfully and be even more willing to help other service workers do their jobs well."

    What is meaningful work? Work that benefits the people is meaningful. What is happiness? Bringing joy to others is one's own happiness. What is honor? Gaining the people's trust and love is the highest honor. From Zou Guozhen, an ordinary service worker, people have gained profound enlightenment. (Attached picture)

　　崇高的职业
　　本报记者　叶世涛　周胜林
          经理、服务员
    我们从热闹的福州路（过去习惯称呼的四马路）拐弯，在一所大医院对面的弄堂里，找到了保健旅馆。
    这是6月的一个平常的下午，气候是少有的闷热。火伞般的太阳，烤得脚下的柏油马路几乎要熔化了；一走进保健旅馆的客房，身上却立刻产生一种清新凉快的感觉。这里并排放着几张白色的铁床，几个旅客躺在床上看书和休息。客房里安安静静，只有一个穿戴白衣白帽、中等身材的女服务员在一角忙碌着。她刚刚擦罢门窗，正弯着腰在给旅客用凉水洗席子。我们在门口站了一会，看她一张张地揩洗，时而擦擦额上的汗珠，时而同身旁的旅客谈上一两句话。“天天都这样洗吗？”我们走前一步问。她微笑着点点头。
    她就是保健旅馆的经理邹国珍。
    保健旅馆是一家特殊的旅馆。说它是旅馆，因为它毕竟还是供给外地的客人投宿；但是它又不同一般的旅馆，因为来这里的旅客，身上多多少少都带点病痛：有的患着不需要住医院的慢性病，有的刚刚动过手术需要短期疗养，还有一些人是远郊的农民，到上海来看病，当天回不去的，就在这儿耽搁一两个晚上。从去年10月旅馆开办以来，邹国珍就是这里的经理。她不仅管好了旅馆，而且和服务员一样，给旅客打扫房间、端茶送水，甚至洗衣、买菜、烧饭，样样都来。要不是经过介绍，我们那里会料到她就是旅馆的经理呢！
        一切为了旅客
    有病的旅客，要求总比一般旅客高一些、多一些。就拿饮食来说吧，南方北方人的口味固然两样，有些病人还要吃点特殊的东西。像肾脏病人不能吃咸的，生胃病的又该多吃一点面食，也有的旅客只能吃稀粥。邹国珍总是想尽办法让他们吃得开心，吃得满意。“五一”节，她丈夫买了三只苹果让她游行时解渴，她想起一个旅客要吃苹果，就留给了他。邹国珍对待旅客永远是那么热情，那么关心。旅客要什么，她都尽力去办，从不厌烦。一天，一位旅客突然胃病发作，不断呕吐，邹国珍和另一个服务员为他端水、买药、倒痰盂、烧稀饭，忙了一上午，那个旅客感动得连连道谢。平常，有些旅客心情不愉快的时候，她就去同他们谈心、说笑话；有些旅客接到家信，自己无法写回信的时候，她又主动去代写。病重的旅客，自己不能吃饭，她就一羹匙一羹匙的喂。
    在旅馆客堂的一张桌子上，我们看到一具药箱，里面放着体温计、酒精、棉花和各种常用药品。保健旅馆备个药箱。原来这个女经理不仅是服务员，还是一个护理员呢！现在，她已经从医生和护士那里学会了一般护理工作。
        依依不舍
    邹国珍把旅客当作亲人，旅客也把邹国珍当作亲人。许多感人的故事，就这样在他们中间产生了。
    三月的一个下午，一辆三轮车出现在保健旅馆的门口——来了一个双腿残废的年青旅客。
    这个青年叫周金明。是湖南省一个地质勘探队的工人。不久以前，周金明在一次爆破中腿部受了伤，两条腿齐膝截去了，年轻人从此失去了欢笑。领导上特地派人千里迢迢送他来上海治伤和装假腿。
    周金明住进旅馆的头几天，神情忧郁。每当神经作痛时，总是长吁短叹：“完了，没有腿还能做什么工作啊。”邹国珍听了非常焦急，她理解残废人的心情，就常常劝慰他：“小周，你这样讲不对呀！身体残废了，只要思想不残废，还是一个有用的人。你装好了假腿，重事不能做，轻便工作还是能做的。不论做什么事，都是为党工作。邹国珍常常给他讲吴运铎和一些英雄的故事，鼓励他战胜困难。
    从邹国珍的关怀中，周金明感到一种亲切和温暖，小伙子的心里渐渐开朗起来，脸上浮现了笑容。
    有一天夜里，周金明的伤口突然发痛，邹国珍一个人背着他到对面的仁济医院去挂急诊。周金明的腿伤慢慢好起来了，邹国珍常常背着他到客堂里和别的旅客下棋，打扑克牌，给他看连环画消遣；有时还请人陪周金明乘三轮车到“大世界”游乐场去玩玩。
    二个月后，周金明装好假腿，准备回去了。邹国珍事先给他买好车票，陪他到火车站，送他上车；又再三叮嘱列车员一路上好好照顾他。临别的时候，周金明感激得说不出话来，长久地紧握着邹国珍的手，依依不舍……
    他们变成了亲密的朋友。周金明回到湖南以后，常常写信来告诉他的生活情况。不久之前，他来信说自己的拐棍坏了，要求代买一副。邹国珍买到了拐棍，跑了邮局、火车站等好多地方，都不能寄运，最后，找到湖南省驻上海的采购员，带给了周金明。
        决心干一辈子
    邹国珍今年不过三十四岁，从前是一个普通的家庭妇女，六年前，她就进旅馆当服务员。这些年来，她已经深深地爱上了这行工作。她用充满自豪的语气告诉我们：决心干一辈子。
    “这个工作，我越做越感到有意思。”她说。“到我们这里来的旅客，不是工人、农民，就是机关干部。他们来的时候大都愁眉苦脸，住上一个时期，就高高兴兴回去。看到他们健康起来，又能去参加建设，我心里和他们一样的愉快。”
    旅客们走了，服务员的辛勤劳动却永远留在他们心里。
    我们翻开旅馆的意见簿，看到一页页充满感情的文字，歌颂着平凡的服务工作。我们还看到一大堆表扬信件和大字报，多半是旅客回到工作岗位以后写来的。他们说：“在你们那里住了几天，好像上了生动的一课。”他们说：“在你们那里得到那么好的照料，是党给我们带来的幸福。”他们说：“我们在工作中想起你们的服务精神，克服困难的信心就更加足了。”……
    每一句称赞和表扬，对邹国珍都是鼓励，也是鞭策。她说：
      “我不过做了一些应该做的事情，想不到对党对国家有那么大的关系。想到这些，我就要加倍周到地为旅客服务，就更加愿意帮助其他服务员把工作做好。”
    什么是有意义的工作？对人民有益的工作就有意义。什么是幸福？把愉快带给别人就是自己的幸福。什么是荣誉？得到人民的信任和热爱就是最高的荣誉。从邹国珍这个普通的服务人员身上，人们得到了深刻启示。（附图片）
