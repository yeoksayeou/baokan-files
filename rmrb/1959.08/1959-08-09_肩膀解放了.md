Comrades! Have you seen these two photos below! This is the situation of the handling workers of the Xizhimen Timber Business Office transporting logs before and after the technical innovation. What a sharp contrast! Handling work is a heavy, physically demanding job. People who do this kind of work must be young and strong; when they get old and their physical strength weakens, they can no longer earn this "hero's" living. After liberation, the Party cared for us, and the older ones were no longer allowed to do this work, but were transferred to the elderly team to do light work such as storage. We two were originally supposed to be transferred to the elderly team too. But now we don't have to go, because technical innovation has made us young again, and we can continue to do our original work for another ten years!

The story is like this: Last year, the leadership called on everyone to engage in technical innovation. At first, we thought, what kind of technical innovation can we "old roughs" engage in? After several meetings and discussions, we finally understood. At the discussion, some people said: "The Communist Party has led us workers to stand up, and now, it is helping us to liberate ourselves from heavy physical labor, asking us to liberate our shoulders..." This sentence gave us great inspiration. We thought, if we could use a car to transport logs, that would really liberate our shoulders. However, moving logs onto the car is not an easy task. After several days of hard thinking, we came up with a method: just use two wheels, remove the car board, and replace it with triangular iron to make the car frame, and then install a piece of wood on the car frame as a lever; install a pair of hooks on the front and rear ends of the lever; in addition, install two pieces of wood as push handles, and the "log-hugging car" is made. We tried it, and it really worked. When transporting logs, just push the "log-hugging car" straddling towards the log, and hook the two ends of the log with the front and rear hooks, and you can easily push away the large log weighing thousands of pounds.

The successful creation of the "log-hugging car" has completely changed our work. In the past, it took eight people to move a log weighing more than a thousand pounds, and even a lighter log weighing three or four hundred pounds had to be lifted by four people; after walking a distance, we would be sweating and panting; if the road was long, we would have to change shoulders and take relays in the middle; after resting, we would have to pour two large bowls of water straight down our throats. After a day's work, we would be so tired that our backs ached and our legs hurt, and our shoulders would be pressed out of meat pies. Everyone said that those who do this hard work can only live to be forty or fifty years old, even though they could live to be sixty or seventy, and they will get leg pain when they get old and cannot even walk. Especially when the operation is not well coordinated during handling, or the road is slippery after rain, it is easy to cause industrial accidents such as crushing legs and feet. Generally, ten days without an accident is considered a safe team. Now that we have the "log-hugging car," one or two people can easily transport large logs weighing thousands of pounds, not only is the handling efficiency high, but long-distance handling does not require changing shoulders and taking relays in the middle, nor do we have to bend our backs and pant with sweat, and there have been no industrial accidents for more than half a year, which is really both labor-saving and safe.

In the past, everyone was worried when they saw large logs. Now everyone is rushing to push them, and even we say: "Take care of us! Let us push it! We can do this, you have longer days to work in the future!" To be honest, with the "log-hugging car," we seem to be many years younger, and we are more and more energetic, and no one complains about the line of work they are doing anymore. What we are thinking about is how to carry out technical innovation in all aspects, do our work better and faster, and repay the Party for its care for us. Now we often say: "Shoulders are liberated, thanks to the Communist Party." (Attached pictures)

    肩膀解放了
    西直门木材经营处搬运工人  焦光厚、邸富顺
    同志！你看见下面这两张照片了吧！这是我们西直门木材经营处搬运工人在技术革新前后搬运原木的情况，多么鲜明的对比！搬运工作是一种笨重的强体力劳动。干这种活儿的人，要年轻、力壮；年纪老了，体力弱了，这碗“英雄”饭也就吃不成了。解放后，党关心我们，年纪大的就不让干这活儿，给转到老年队去做保管等轻活儿。我们两个人本来也该转到老年队去了。但是，现在不用去了，因为技术革新又使我们年轻了，我们还可以再干十几年本行呢！
    事情是这样的：去年，领导上号召大家搞技术革新，起初我们想，像我们这样的“老粗”还能搞什么技术革新？经过几次开会讨论，我们思想才通了。在讨论会上，有些人说：“共产党领导我们工人翻了身，现在，又来帮助我们从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，要我们解放肩膀……。”这句话给了我们很大启发。我们想，抬原木要是能改用车子装运，那可真是解放肩膀了。可是，把原木搬上车子也不是件轻易的事。经过几天的苦思穷想，我们想出了一个办法：光用两个车轮子，把车板拆掉改用三角铁做车架，再在车架上安装上一根木头作为杠杆；在杠杆前端和后端各装上一对挂钩；另外，再安上二根木头作为推手把，“抱木车”就这样制成了。一试验，还真灵。搬运原木时，只要把“抱木车”骑跨朝原木推上去，用前后挂钩把原木两头挂住，就可把上千斤的大原木轻轻推走了。
    “抱木车”这一工具的创造成功，使我们的工作完全变了样。过去搬运一根一千多斤重的原木需要八个人，就是三四百斤较轻的原木也得四个人才能抬起来；走上一段路，就压得汗流气喘；要是路远，还得在中途换肩打接力；一歇下来，还得直着喉咙灌上两大碗水。干完了一天活儿，直累得腰酸腿疼，肩上压得出肉饼子。大家都说，干这一行累活，明明能活六、七十岁的人也只能活上四、五十岁，老了，还会落个腿疼病，连道也走不了了。特别在搬运时操作配合不好，或者雨后道滑，一不小心，很容易造成砸腿压脚等工伤事故，一般十天不出事故，就算是安全组了。现在我们有了“抱木车”，只要一两个人就可以把上千斤重的大原木轻轻运走，不光是搬运效率高，长距离搬运也不用中途换肩打接力，也不用曲腰弓背累得气喘汗流了，而且半年多没有发生工伤事故，真是既省力又安全。
    过去，大家看到大原木，心里就犯愁。现在大家都抢着推，连我们也说：“照顾我们一下吧！让我们来推吧！这事我们干得了，你们以后干的日子还长着呐！”说真的，有了“抱木车”，我们好像年轻了好多年，越干越有劲，再也没人抱怨自己干的这一行了。我们想的是如何在各方面都进行技术革新，把工作干得更好更快，来报答党对我们的关怀。现在我们常念道着：“肩膀得解放，多亏共产党。”（附图片）
