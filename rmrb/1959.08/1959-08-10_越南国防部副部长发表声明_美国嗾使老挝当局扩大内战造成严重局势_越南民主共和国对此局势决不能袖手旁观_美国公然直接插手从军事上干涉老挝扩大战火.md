Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th. Xie Guangbao, Deputy Minister of Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos, issued a statement today on the current situation in Laos, pointing out that the situation in Laos is very serious due to the continued expansion of the civil war by US imperialism and the Sananikone government. The statement said that US imperialism is constantly importing American military advisors into Laos and importing large quantities of weapons and ammunition into Laos through Thailand and South Vietnam. American military advisors have been assigned to various military regions and units, controlling the command of the Royal Lao Army. American military advisors are present in the large number of troops that the Sananikone government has mobilized to Sam Neua and the Vietnamese-Laotian border areas. The Sananikone government has also declared a state of emergency in five provinces.

The statement said that in order to deceive public opinion, the Sananikone government continues to rudely slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Lao internal affairs. At the same time, the Lao Foreign Minister has declared that the Royal Lao Government may request intervention by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). The US State Department and reactionary American newspapers have also constantly instigated the Sananikone government to expand the Lao civil war and to slander and provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. SEATO Secretary-General Pote Sarasin and others have even declared that Laos is within the “protective scope” of this aggressive bloc, and that the bloc will take action when requested by relevant countries. The Thai Ministry of Defense announced on August 7th that Thailand would send troops to assist the Kingdom of Laos if necessary. Individuals close to the Philippine Foreign Ministry have also clamored that, if necessary, SEATO can mobilize Philippine forces to support the Kingdom of Laos without waiting for Laos to request it. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its propaganda organs are also clamoring to expand the war in Laos.

The statement pointed out that the above situation shows that US imperialism and its followers are attempting to completely turn Laos into an American military base and are preparing to launch a new war in Indochina.

The statement said that as a signatory to the Geneva Agreements and as a neighboring country with more than 1,000 kilometers of border with Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly protested the increasingly serious violations of the Geneva Agreements by US imperialism and the Sananikone government, and the violation of the agreement signed between the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the import of large numbers of military personnel and weapons into Laos, the declaration of a state of war in provinces near the Vietnamese border, and the strengthening of forces in areas near the Vietnamese border are actions that expand the Lao civil war and provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also believes that the act of the Royal Lao Government writing to the United Nations to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a new conspiracy by US imperialism and its lackeys to further tear up the Geneva Agreements and prepare conditions for US imperialism to intensify its aggression against Laos. The current problem in Laos is the implementation of the Geneva Agreements, and this issue does not fall within the purview of the United Nations.

The statement said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very concerned about the current situation in Laos and is constantly watching the intensified preparations for expanding the war by US imperialism, Thailand, and South Vietnam, and is constantly watching the SEATO clamor for expanding the war. If the army of any country dares to intervene in Laos in accordance with the aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism, this is not only an act of aggression against the Lao people, but the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will regard this action as a direct threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In this dangerous situation, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot remain indifferent.

The statement said that the only way to maintain peace in Indochina is that US imperialism and the Royal Lao Government must fully implement the Geneva Agreements. At the same time, the International Commission for Supervision and Control must immediately resume its activities in Laos.

The statement said that the Sananikone government's pursuit of US imperialism, provoking civil war, colluding with the United States, Thailand, and South Vietnam, strengthening military equipment, and expanding the war have violated the highest interests of the Lao people, and it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by this.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 9th. According to reports in local newspapers today, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong received Indian Consul General to Hanoi, Maheshwar Dayal, on August 8th.

During the conversation, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong pointed out that the current situation in Laos is very serious. The Royal Lao Government is blatantly violating the Geneva Agreements, provoking an increasingly serious civil war in Laos, threatening the peace and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Southeast Asian countries.

The newspaper said that Prime Minister Pham Van Dong welcomed the attitude taken by the Indian government and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru have pointed out that, in the current serious situation in Laos, the Lao International Commission should resume its activities to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the agreements signed between the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces are fully implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th. News revealed by various parties, including US officials, confirms that the United States has directly intervened militarily in Laos, expanded the Lao civil war, and threatened peace in Indochina.

American diplomats in Vientiane declared on August 8th that the United States has begun to replace the outdated American equipment used by the Royal Lao Army, including tanks, trucks, and rifles.

These American diplomats also said that since July 25th, approximately one hundred American advisors have arrived in Vientiane to train soldiers of the Royal Lao Army in the use and maintenance of this equipment.

These individuals also said that the American "technicians" assigned to train the Royal Lao Army in the use of American equipment flew directly from the United States to bases in Laos. The news said that American personnel are working with French officers responsible for tactical training of the Lao army. It has been previously reported that, at the direction of the United States, Laos recently signed a joint communiqué with France stipulating that American experts will cooperate with the French military delegation in training the Lao army. This joint communiqué grossly violates the Geneva Agreements and has become a tool for the United States to carry out military intervention in Laos.

American diplomats also revealed that the United States also suggested providing Laos with two "Dakota" transport planes, three "Otter" aircraft, and one trainer aircraft to supplement the transport team that has been airdropping supplies to the Royal Lao Army in areas where the civil war has been occurring in the past few weeks.

News has revealed that, in fact, some American aircraft piloted by American pilots, disguised as "commercial rental aircraft," are being used by the Royal Lao Army to carry out military transportation to the Sam Neua area, helping to expand the flames of war. In addition, some American aircraft piloted by French pilots are also participating in this military transportation work.

A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo on August 7th exposed that the United States has long been plotting to undermine Lao national unity. The dispatch said that the United States "cannot help but privately feel pleased" with the efforts made by Sananikone since coming to power last year to "contain" the Pathet Lao. "For the United States, this is excellent news." United Press International said that since the end of the Indochina War, the United States has invested 40 to 50 million US dollars in Laos each year "and fully supports the Royal Lao Army."

    越南国防部副部长发表声明
    美国嗾使老挝当局扩大内战造成严重局势
    越南民主共和国对此局势决不能袖手旁观
    美国公然直接插手从军事上干涉老挝扩大战火
    新华社河内8日电　曾经在日内瓦会议关于老挝的协议上面签字的越南民主共和国国防部副部长谢光宝今天就老挝当前的局势发表声明指出，由于美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府继续扩大老挝的内战，使老挝的局势非常严重。声明说，美帝国主义不断向老挝输入美国军事顾问，并且经过泰国和南越向老挝输入大批武器和弹药。美国的军事顾问已经被分配到各军区和各个军事单位，操纵老挝王国军队的指挥权。在萨纳尼空政府向桑怒和越老边境地区调集的大批兵力中，就有美国军事顾问。萨纳尼空政府并且宣布五个省处于紧急状态。
    声明说，为了欺骗舆论，萨纳尼空政府不断粗暴地诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政。同时，老挝外交大臣声言老挝王国政府可能要求东南亚条约组织进行干涉。美国国务院和美国反动报纸还不断嗾使萨纳尼空政府扩大老挝内战，对越南民主共和国进行诬蔑和挑衅。东南亚条约组织秘书长沙拉信等并且宣布，老挝处于这个侵略集团的“保护范围”，在有关国家要求时，这个集团将采取行动。泰国国防部8月7日宣称，必要时，泰国将出兵援助老挝王国。接近菲律宾外交部的人士也叫嚷，在必要时，东南亚条约组织不必等待老挝的要求就可以动员菲律宾的力量去支援老挝王国。吴庭艳集团及其宣传机关也叫嚷要扩大老挝的战争。
    声明指出，上述情况表明，美帝国主义及其追随者企图把老挝完全变成美国的军事基地，并且准备在印度支那发动新战争。
    声明说，作为日内瓦协议的签字国，作为同老挝具有一千多公里的边界的邻国，越南民主共和国政府曾经多次抗议美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府日益严重地违反日内瓦协议，违反老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议。越南民主共和国政府认为，向老挝输入大批的军事人员和武器，在靠近越南边界各省宣布处于战争状态，在靠近越南边界的地方加强兵力等行动，是扩大老挝内战和对越南民主共和国的挑衅行动。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府还认为，老挝王国政府写信给联合国诬蔑越南民主共和国的作法，正是美帝国主义和它的走狗进一步撕毁日内瓦协议、为美帝国主义加紧侵略老挝准备条件的新阴谋。老挝当前的问题是履行关于日内瓦协议的问题，这个问题并不属于联合国的职责范围。
    声明说，越南民主共和国非常关心老挝的当前局势，并且时刻注视着美帝国主义、泰国和南越加紧准备扩大战争的行动，时刻注视着东南亚条约组织关于扩大战争的叫嚣。如果有哪一个国家的军队敢于按照美帝国主义的侵略阴谋去干涉老挝，这不仅是对老挝人民的侵略行动，而且，越南民主共和国将把这种行动看作是直接威胁越南民主共和国的安全的行动。在这种危险的情况下，越南民主共和国政府决不能袖手旁观。
    声明说，维护印度支那的和平的唯一道路是美帝国主义和老挝王国政府必须彻底履行日内瓦协议，同时，国际监察和监督委员会必须立即恢复在老挝的活动。
    声明说，萨纳尼空政府追随美帝国主义，挑起内战，同美国、泰国和南越勾结，加强军备和扩大战争，这些行动已经违背了老挝人民的最高利益，它必须对此所造成的一切后果负全部责任。
    新华社河内9日电　据这里报纸今天报道，越南民主共和国总理范文同在8日接见了印度驻河内总领事麦尼西斯。
    范文同总理在谈话时指出，目前的老挝局势非常严重。老挝王国政府明目张胆地违反日内瓦协议，在老挝挑起日益严重的内战，威胁着越南民主共和国和东南亚各国的和平和安全。
    报纸说，范文同总理对印度政府和印度总理尼赫鲁采取的态度表示欢迎。印度政府和尼赫鲁总理曾经指出，在老挝目前的严重情况下，老挝国际委员会应该恢复活动，以保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议以及老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间所签订的协议得到充分的履行。
    新华社9日讯　包括美国官方人士在内的各方面透露出来的消息证实，美国已经直接在军事上干涉老挝，扩大老挝内战，威胁印度支那和平。
    在万象的美国外交人士在8日宣称，美国已经开始更换老挝王国军队使用的过时的美国装备，其中包括坦克、卡车和步枪。
    这些美国外交人士还说，从7月25日起，已经有大约一百名美国顾问到达万象，训练老挝王国军队的士兵使用和维修这些装备。
    这些人士还说，奉派去训练老挝王国军队使用美国装备的美国“技术人员”是从美国直接飞到老挝的基地的。消息说，美国人员正在同负责对老挝军队进行战术训练的法国军官一起工作。前已报道，在美国的指使下，老挝同法国最近签订了一个联合公报，规定美国专家同法国军事代表团配合训练老挝军队。这个联合公报粗暴地违反了日内瓦协议，并且成为美国对老挝进行军事干涉的工具。
    美国外交人士还透露，美国并且建议为老挝提供两架“达科他式”运输机、三架“海獭式”飞机和一架教练机，以补充在过去几星期中一直向发生内战地区的老挝王国军队空投供应物资的运输队。
    有消息透露，事实上已经有一些由美国驾驶员驾驶的美国飞机，披着“商用出租飞机”的外衣，被老挝王国军队用来向桑怒地区进行军事运输，帮助扩大战火。另外，也有一些由法国驾驶员驾驶的美国飞机参加这种军事运输工作。
    合众国际社7日从东京发出的一条消息，暴露出美国很久以来就蓄谋破坏老挝的民族团结。消息说，美国对萨纳尼空去年上台以来对“遏止”老挝爱国战线党方面所作的努力“不能不私下感到高兴”。“对于美国来说，这是极好的消息。”合众国际社说，在印度支那战争结束以来，美国每年投入老挝的经费达四千万到五千万美元，“并且完全支持老挝王国军队”。
