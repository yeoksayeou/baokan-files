Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch: The broad masses of workers on Beijing's industrial front have overcome high temperatures and the rainy season, overfulfilling the total output value plan for July by 5.8%. So far, the production plan has been overfulfilled every month for the first seven months of this year. The total industrial output value has increased by 1.16 times compared to the same period last year, and the output of major products has also increased significantly compared to the same period last year: steel increased by 533.5%, iron increased by 35.7%, coal increased by 70.4%, machine tools increased by 18.2%, and cotton yarn increased by 55.2%.

The main reason why Beijing was able to overfulfill the plan in July, despite the high temperature and rainy weather, was the thorough implementation of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the continued promotion of the creative spirit and revolutionary drive of the broad masses of workers, and the criticism of the sentiments of complacency and slackness among a few cadres.

In light of the still heavy industrial production tasks in the second half of the year and the "middle-of-the-road" mentality existing among a few cadres, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee convened a city-wide conference of Party member cadres in the industrial system in mid-July, deploying the third quarter production battle ideologically and organizationally. After the conference, factories and mining enterprises immediately convened worker's congresses or worker representative conferences, using the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction as a yardstick to review the work of the first half of the year, promote the creative spirit and revolutionary drive of the broad masses of workers, and discuss and formulate new leap forward plans and measures for increasing production and practicing economy. This pushed the city's campaign to increase production and practice economy to a new high, and production in the second half of the month increased significantly compared to the first half of the month.

According to the spirit of the Party's General Line, the leading cadres at all levels of the Jingxi Mining Bureau conducted in-depth discussions, criticized the slack sentiments of some cadres, and many people generally realized that the drive must be maintained at all times and that we must strive to be upstream at all times. On the basis of improved ideological understanding, the leading cadres of this bureau personally went to the front line to specifically direct production and organized the bureau's employees to launch a vigorous socialist labor competition between mines, sections, shifts, and individuals. As a result, the overall production outlook of the bureau was immediately renewed, and the average daily output of coal rose from 15,373 tons in the first ten days of the month to 17,975 tons in the last ten days of the month. The entire month's production not only made up for the initial deficit, but also achieved remarkable results in the double leap forward of coal mining and tunneling, overfulfilling the state coal production plan and tunneling plan by 2.07% and 1.59% respectively.

High temperature and heavy rain brought many difficulties to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. The newly built No. 3 blast furnace, two small blast furnaces, two electric furnaces, and No. 1 coke oven were once shut down. Under such circumstances, the Party Secretary and the manager of the company both personally went to the site to lead the workers to actively fight against natural disasters, minimizing the impact of the disasters. The pig iron output in July completed 88.05% of the state plan, an increase of 2% compared to June; the steel output completed 84.73% of the state plan, an increase of 38.5% compared to June. Steel exceeded the national plan by 14%.

Through the workers' representative conference, the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory criticized the slack sentiments of a few workshop cadres, and at the same time clarified that the weak links in the factory's production increase were the output and quality of tools and glass cores, which could not keep up with the needs of other production departments. After the meeting, the workshops immediately came to support these two production departments. As a result, the average daily output of glass cores in July increased by 70,000 pieces, and the quality of tools also improved significantly. The solution of these two major key problems ensured that the factory overfulfilled the monthly output value plan by 62%, with an output increase of more than 2.5% compared to the previous month, and the yield of the main product, electronic tubes, increased compared to June.

In the discussion, the workers of Xinhua Printing Plant clearly established the concept of an all-round leap forward. In the new upsurge of the competition to increase production and practice economy, they continued to implement a set of rules and regulations to ensure quality and practice strict economy, and realized nineteen technical innovations. Therefore, the plant not only completed the output value plan two days ahead of schedule, but also greatly reduced defective products and waste products, and the loss of product accidents decreased by 70% compared to June.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch: The Beijing Municipal Party Committee convened a conference of Party secretaries and factory directors of industrial departments on the 3rd, deciding to seize August and September, and immediately launch a mass movement to improve labor organization, vigorously carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, improve labor productivity, comprehensively overfulfill the production plan, and greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, and Jia Tingsan, Minister of the Municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, both spoke at the meeting.

The meeting pointed out that on the Beijing industrial front, after the battle in July, not only were achievements made in production, but also the ideological understanding of leading cadres and the broad masses of workers was greatly improved. After the Municipal Party Committee convened the conference of Party member cadres in the industrial system in mid-July, factories and mining enterprises mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate leap forward targets and specific measures, and made the targets and measures more practical and in line with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical; at the same time, they also criticized the slack thinking of individual units that repeatedly lowered production targets without basis. According to incomplete statistics, the city's third quarter industrial leap forward plan has been increased by about 11.5% compared to the original estimate, based on needs and possibilities; among them, the motor industry, which had more difficulties, increased by 38.4%, and the chemical industry increased by 24%. The meeting believed that this shows that morale can be boosted but not dampened. The same material conditions produce completely different results between boosting morale and slackening efforts.

The meeting pointed out that after Beijing's industrial production overfulfilled the production plan every month in the first seven months of this year, it must be recognized that the tasks in the future are still very tight, and about one-half of the city's total industrial output value must be completed in the next five months. The main task at present is to continue to boost morale, conscientiously implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, resolutely oppose slack sentiments, and comprehensively overfulfill the production plan in a faster, better, and more economical way. At present, we must first seize August and September, deeply mobilize the masses, give full play to the potential of all aspects, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the plan for the third quarter. In August and September, we should focus on improving labor productivity as the central link to drive an overall leap forward. In order to achieve this goal, first, we must improve labor organization; second, we must carry out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The meeting required the front and rear of the industrial front, the material supply departments and the production departments, as well as the various departments within the enterprise, to work together with one heart and one mind to complete this battle task together.

Based on the effective experiences in the great leap forward of production in the past year and the first seven months of this year, the meeting put forward five specific measures for grasping August and September: First, give prominence to politics, mobilize the broad masses of workers, and vigorously carry out the socialist emulation campaign. Second, the Party first secretaries and other leading cadres of factories and mining enterprises should personally go to the front line to specifically direct production, timely discover and solve problems in production, and promote advanced experience. Third, strengthen the concept of time, seize every second, calculate output on a daily basis, and check work on a daily basis. Fourth, act vigorously and resolutely, grasp tightly and ruthlessly, oppose the slow and procrastinating style, and ensure that the work of the day, the ten days, and the month is completed on time. Fifth, we must be vigorous and down-to-earth, and do our work in a thorough, meticulous, and specific manner.

The meeting particularly emphasized that in grasping production in August and September, we must conscientiously implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, complete the production tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way, pay attention to both increasing production and practicing economy. While grasping output value and output, we must grasp the variety, quality, and cost of products, and continue to increase small commodities that are closely related to the people's lives.

In order to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of the third quarter production plan, the meeting required all enterprise units to continue to implement the policy of combining mass movements with centralized leadership, conscientiously implement operating procedures, strengthen technical management, strengthen safety education for workers, and achieve safe production.

The meeting pointed out that there is less than two months left in the decisive third quarter, and time is very urgent. Factories and mining enterprises must immediately take action and seize the opportunity to lead this decisive battle. Leading cadres at all levels must quickly go to the forefront of production, closely combine with the broad masses of workers, and effectively direct production. (Attached photo)

    批判了松劲情绪　鼓起了革命干劲
    北京工业月月超产一跃再跃
    今年头七个月总产值比去年同期增长一点一六倍
    市委布置八九月生产，号召继续努力不懈全面超额完成三季度计划
    新华社5日讯　北京工业战线上的广大职工战胜高温和雨季，7月份超额5.8％完成了总产值计划。至此，今年头七个月月月超额完成生产计划，工业总产值比去年同期增长了一点一六倍，主要产品产量较去年同期也都有了很大增长：钢增长533.5％，铁增长35.7％，煤增长70.4％，机床增长18.2％，棉纱增长55.2％。
    北京市能够在高温多雨的7月份超额完成计划，主要是深入贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设的总路线，继续发扬广大职工的创造精神和革命干劲，批判了少数干部中的自满、松劲情绪。
    根据下半年工业生产任务仍然相当繁重和少数干部存在着中游思想的情况，中共北京市委7月中旬召开了全市工业系统党员干部大会，从思想上和组织上部署了第三季度的生产战役。大会结束以后，各厂矿企业立即用一周左右的时间，普遍召开了职工大会或职工代表大会，用党的建设社会主义总路线的尺度，检查了上半年的工作，发扬了广大职工的创造精神和革命干劲，讨论和制订了新的跃进计划和增产节约措施。这样，就把全市的增产节约运动推向了新的高潮，下半月的生产比上半月有了显著增长。
    京西矿务局的各级领导干部根据党的总路线的精神，进行了深入的讨论，批判了部分干部的松劲情绪，很多人普遍认识到干劲必须时时鼓足，必须时时力争上游。在思想认识有了提高的基础上，这个局的领导干部亲临前线具体指挥生产，并且组织全局职工展开了轰轰烈烈的矿与矿、段与段、班与班、个人与个人的社会主义劳动竞赛。因此，全局的生产面貌立即焕然一新，煤炭平均日产量上旬为一万五千三百七十三吨，下旬即上升到一万七千九百七十五吨；全月生产不但弥补了月初的亏空，而且取得了采煤、掘进双跃进的显著成绩，分别超额2.07％和1.59％完成了国家产煤计划和掘进计划。
    高温多雨给石景山钢铁公司带来了很多困难，新建的三号高炉、两座小高炉、两座电炉和一号焦炉，都曾一度停产。在这样的情况下，公司的党委书记、经理都亲临现场，领导职工积极同自然灾害作斗争，使灾害的影响缩小到最低限度。7月份的生铁产量完成国家计划的88.05％，比6月份增长了2％，钢产量完成国家计划的84.73％，比6月份增长了38.5％。钢材超额14％完成了国家计划。
    北京电子管厂通过职工代表大会，批判了少数车间干部的松劲情绪，同时明确了全厂增产的薄弱环节是工模具和玻璃芯柱的产量质量赶不上其他生产部门的需要。会后，各车间马上来支援这两个生产部门，结果7月份玻璃芯柱的平均日产量提高了七万支，工模具的质量也有了显著提高。这两大关键的解决，保证全厂超额62％完成了月产值计划，产量比上月增加2.5％以上，主要产品电子管的成品率比6月份有了提高。
    新华印刷厂职工在讨论中明确树立了全面跃进的观念，在增产节约竞赛新高潮中，继续贯彻执行保证质量和厉行节约的一套规章制度，实现了十九项技术革新。因此，全厂不仅提前两天完成了产值计划，而且次品废品也大大减少，产品事故的损失比6月份减少七成。
    新华社5日讯　中共北京市委3日召开全市工业部门党委书记和厂长会议，决定抓紧8、9月，立即开展一个改善劳动组织、大搞技术革命和技术革新的群众运动，提高劳动生产率，全面超额完成生产计划，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    市委书记处书记郑天翔，市委工业部部长、北京市副市长贾庭三，都在会上讲了话。
    会议指出，在北京工业战线上，经过7月份的战斗，不仅生产上获得了成就，而且领导干部和广大职工的思想认识也有了很大提高。7月中旬市委召开了工业系统党员干部大会以后，各厂矿企业都发动群众讨论和制订了跃进指标和具体措施，并且使指标和措施更加切合实际，符合多快好省的精神；同时，也批判了个别单位无根据地把生产指标一再降低的松劲思想。据不完全统计，全市第三季度的工业跃进计划，根据需要和可能，已比原来预计的提高了11.5％左右；其中困难较多的电机工业提高38.4％，化学工业提高24％。会议认为，由此可见，气可鼓而不可泄，同样的物质条件，在一鼓劲和一松劲之间，效果完全不同。
    会议指出，北京市的工业生产在今年头七个月月月超额完成生产计划以后，必须看到今后的任务仍然十分紧张，全市工业总产值还有二分之一左右要在今后五个月内完成。当前的主要任务是：继续鼓足干劲，认真贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线，坚决反对松劲情绪，多快好省地全面超额完成生产计划。现在，必须首先抓紧8、9两月，深入发动群众，充分发挥各方面的潜力，力争全面超额完成第三季度的计划。在8、9两月中，应以提高劳动生产率为中心环节，带动全局跃进。为了达到这个目的，第一，要改善劳动组织；第二，要开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。会议要求工业战线的前方和后方，物资供应部门和生产部门，以及企业内部的各个部门之间，同心协力，拧成一股劲，共同来完成这个战斗任务。
    会议根据去年和今年头七个月生产大跃进中行之有效的经验，提出了大抓8、9两月的五项具体措施：一，政治挂帅，发动广大职工群众，轰轰烈烈地开展社会主义评比竞赛运动。二，各厂矿企业的党委第一书记及其他领导干部，要亲临前线，具体指挥生产，及时发现和解决生产中的问题，推广先进经验。三，加强时间观念，分秒必争，按日计算产量，按日检查工作。四，雷厉风行，抓紧、抓狠，反对慢慢腾腾、拖拖拉拉的作风，保证当天、当旬、当月的工作按时完成。五，既要轰轰烈烈，又要踏踏实实，把工作做得深入、细致、具体。
    会议特别强调指出，在大抓8、9两月的生产中，必须认真贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，多快好省地完成生产任务，既注意增产，也注意节约。在抓产值、产量的同时，要抓产品的品种、质量和成本，并且继续增加同人民生活有密切关系的小商品。
    为了保证全面超额完成第三季度生产计划，会议要求各企业单位继续贯彻大搞群众运动与集中领导相结合的方针，认真执行操作规程，加强技术管理，加强对职工的安全教育，作到安全生产。
    会议指出，决胜性的第三季度所剩下的时间还不到两个月，时间非常急迫，各厂矿企业必须立即行动起来，不失时机地领导这个决定性的战斗。各级领导干部要迅速走上生产的最前线，跟广大工人紧密结合，有效地指挥生产。（附图片）
