　　Advanced Plans, Concrete Measures
　　North Korea Vigorously Increases Pig, Cattle, Chicken, and Duck Breeding
    (Our newspaper, Pyongyang, 13th dispatch) The people of North Korea are vigorously developing livestock and poultry production with soaring enthusiasm, aiming to reach an annual production level of 400,000 tons of meat, 460,000 tons of milk, and 1.5 billion eggs in the coming years.

    The Korean Workers' Party, at its Standing Committee meeting in June this year, issued a call to further develop the livestock industry. Now, farmers in northern North Korea, whether in mountainous areas or plains, have acted swiftly and uniformly. In order to solve the fundamental problem of raising livestock and poultry – the feed problem – agricultural cooperatives have sown two to three times more corn, beans, and other feed crops after the wheat harvest than they did last year. Huanghae South Province alone has sown 25,000 chongbo (one chongbo equals fifteen Chinese mu) of corn. Due to the cold weather in northern North Korea, farmers were accustomed to planting only one season a year in the past. This time, the Labor Party called for planting two seasons, using wheat's aftercrop and rice's precrop to plant feed crops.

    In order to greatly increase livestock and poultry, agricultural cooperatives are making various efforts to have 30 sows, 100 hens and ducks, and 6 Korean dairy cows for every 100 households within this year. Farms and ranches in various places are also vigorously breeding livestock and poultry. In addition, efforts will be stepped up to improve breeds and veterinary work.

    In addition, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in northern North Korea, except for rice farms, have been converted into farms mainly for raising livestock and poultry. Recently, eighteen new ranches have been established near cities and workers' districts, and twenty-one agricultural and pastoral farms have been expanded. A newly established ranch in South Pyongan Province has already raised 250 calves and will eventually expand to 1,000 head. The newly built chicken farm near Kaesong will raise 70,000 chickens.

    In order to support the development of animal husbandry in rural areas, employees of factories in various parts of North Korea are increasing the production of agricultural machinery beyond their production plans. The Sipo Agricultural Tool Factory will produce 60 chaff cutters before "August 15th" to supply to rural areas.

　　朝鲜大力增殖猪牛鸡鸭
    本报平壤13日电　朝鲜人民正以冲天干劲大力发展家畜家禽生产，要在最近几年内达到每年生产四十万吨肉，四十六万吨牛奶和十五亿个鸡蛋的水平。
    朝鲜劳动党在今年6月举行常务委员会会议时，提出了进一步发展畜产业的号召。现在朝鲜北部各地的农民，不论是山区、平原都迅速一致地行动起来了。各农业社为了解决饲养家畜家禽的根本问题——饲料问题，在小麦收割后播种了等于去年二、三倍的玉米、豆类等饲料作物。仅黄海南道一个道就播种二万五千町步（一町步合十五市亩）的玉米。朝鲜北部由于天气冷，过去农民习惯于一年种一季。这次劳动党号召种两季，利用小麦的后作和水稻的前作种饲料作物。
    为了大量增殖家畜家禽，各农业社正在进行各种努力，要在今年内使每一百户农户有三十头母猪、一百只母鸡、母鸭和六头朝鲜奶牛。各地的农场牧场也在大力繁殖家畜家禽。另外要大力加强改良畜种和兽医的工作。
    此外，朝鲜北部的国营农牧场除了水稻农场外，都改为以饲养家畜家禽为主的农场。最近还在城市和工人区附近新设立了十八个牧场，扩大了二十一个农牧场。平安南道新设的一个牧场已养了二百五十头牛犊，将来要发展到一千头。开城附近新建的养鸡场要养七万只鸡。
    为了支援农村发展畜牧业，朝鲜各地工厂的职工在生产计划以外增产一些农业机械。洗浦农具厂要在“八·一五”前生产六十台铡草机供应农村。
