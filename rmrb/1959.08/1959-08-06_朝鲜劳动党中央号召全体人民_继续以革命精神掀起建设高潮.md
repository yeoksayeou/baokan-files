Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th August: To welcome the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15th", the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party today issued a letter to all Korean people, calling on the Korean people to continue to launch an upsurge in socialist construction and actively struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

The letter to the people first extended congratulations to all Korean people and gratitude to the liberator of the Korean people—the Soviet people and the Soviet Communist Party. The letter to the people said that in just over ten years since liberation, in the northern half of Korea, which used to be a backward colonial and semi-feudal society, an advanced socialist system has been firmly established today. Korea's people's economy is developing rapidly with unprecedented speed and on a grand scale. Today, Korea has become an industrial and agricultural country with a solid foundation for an independent national economy.

The letter to the people said that all working people are greeting the anniversary of liberation with the pride and self-esteem of the victors who completed the first five-year plan's industrial gross output value plan ahead of schedule. After the completion of this year's people's economic plan, the gross industrial output value can reach seven times that of before the war. It now takes only forty-seven days to produce the industrial products produced in the entire year of 1953. This year's agriculture has seen great development. Thirty-seven hectares of irrigation area have been newly expanded from September of last year to the spring of this year. This year's wheat and other summer crops have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and autumn crops are also growing very well. Korea is now in a period of prosperity and rapid development.

The letter to the people called on all sectors of the people's economy to continue to create new achievements with a revolutionary spirit. In order to realize socialist industrialization as soon as possible, we must produce more iron and steel, machinery, and accelerate the realization of electrification. Light industry and local industry must produce more varieties and better-quality food and daily necessities. Agriculture must produce more grain, achieve a decisive development in animal husbandry in the shortest possible time, and vigorously increase the production of oil crops and vegetables. At the same time, efforts should be made to promote the irrigation, mechanization, and electrification of rural areas. In particular, the strength of the entire party and the entire people must be mobilized to realize the mechanization of agriculture.

The letter to the people said that because of the US imperialism's occupation of South Korea, Korea is still in a state of division, and the US aggression troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea. The letter to the people called on the South Korean people to resolutely oppose the war provocation schemes of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, oppose their sinful rule, and fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The letter to the people said that the wishes of Korean residents in Japan to return to the embrace of the motherland must be realized as soon as possible, and no conspiracy can stop them from returning home.

    朝鲜劳动党中央号召全体人民
    继续以革命精神掀起建设高潮
    新华社平壤5日电　为迎接“八·一五”朝鲜解放十四周年，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会今天发表告全体朝鲜人民书，号召朝鲜人民继续掀起社会主义建设高潮，为祖国的和平统一、使美军立即从南朝鲜撤走而积极进行斗争。
    告人民书首先向全体朝鲜人民表示祝贺，向朝鲜人民的解放者——苏联人民和苏联共产党表示感谢。告人民书说，解放后仅仅十几年内，在过去是落后的殖民地半封建社会的朝鲜北半部，今天已经巩固地建立起先进的社会主义制度。朝鲜的人民经济正以史无前例的速度和宏大的规模迅速地发展着。今天朝鲜已成为一个具有独立民族经济的巩固基础的工业和农业国家。
    告人民书说，全体劳动人民以提前完成第一个五年计划工业总产值计划的胜利者的骄傲和自豪来迎接解放纪念日。今年的人民经济计划完成后，工业总产值可达到战前的七倍。现在只用四十七天就可以生产1953年全年生产的工业产品。今年的农业有很大的发展。从去年9月到今年春天新扩大了三十七万町步灌溉面积。今年的小麦等夏季作物取得了空前的丰收，秋季作物也生长得很好。今年朝鲜正处于繁荣昌盛飞跃发展的时期。
    告人民书号召各人民经济部门要继续以革命精神创造新的成就。为了早日实现社会主义工业化，要生产更多的钢铁、机械，加速实现电气化。轻工业和地方工业要生产品种更多、质量更好的食品和生活必需品。农业要生产更多的谷物，在最短期间内使畜产业有决定性的发展，并且要大力增产油脂作物和蔬菜。同时要努力促进农村的水利化、机械化和电气化。特别是要动员全党和全体人民的力量来实现农业的机械化。
    告人民书说，由于美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜，朝鲜还处于分裂状态，美国侵略军队必须立即从南朝鲜撤走。告人民书号召南朝鲜人民坚决反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的战争挑衅阴谋，反对他们的罪恶统治，为祖国的和平统一而斗争。告人民书说，旅日朝侨希望回到祖国怀抱的愿望必须早日实现，任何阴谋手段都不能阻挡他们回国。
