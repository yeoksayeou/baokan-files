Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 17th: As the Arab League Council's Casablanca Conference is about to be held in early September, the UAR is working to improve its relations with other Arab countries, especially with the two long-time pro-Western countries, Jordan and Tunisia.

Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna, who played an important role in the recent restoration of diplomatic relations between the UAR and Jordan, left for Libya on the 16th before visiting Tunisia. Libya is the country that takes care of Tunisia's interests in the Arab League. Last month, it was announced here that the UAR and Tunisia had been in contact in Libya in preparation for the restoration of relations.

The UAR and Tunisia severed relations in October 1958. At that time, the representative of Tunisia attending a certain meeting of the Arab League accused the League of becoming an organization dominated by one interest and one member state, and broke with the UAR.

In April of this year, Hassouna announced to the press that the UAR was ready to "cooperate with Tunisia within the framework of the Arab League." Morocco and Libya then began mediation efforts.

Direct contact between the UAR and Tunisia was conducted through Fadl Galal, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of the Egyptian Region of the UAR. Galal took advantage of his participation in the General Affairs Committee meeting of the All-African People's Conference in Tunisia in May to hold three meetings with Tunisian President Bourguiba. However, it is reported that there are still some difficulties that need to be resolved before the relationship between the two countries can be restored. Tunisia requires the UAR to provide a guarantee of non-interference, while the latter believes that there is no issue of interfering in Tunisian affairs.

The process of restoring relations with Jordan was relatively smooth. The relations between the UAR and Jordan broke down after the UAR recognized the Republic of Iraq in July last year. Since the Majali Cabinet took office in Jordan in May of this year, the relations between the two countries have further deteriorated. Until June of this year, the UAR had been blocking the border with Jordan, which largely relied on importing goods from Lebanon via the Syrian region of the UAR.

After mediation by Lebanon (because Lebanon has a direct economic interest in improving relations between the UAR and Jordan), Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna made a trip to Amman, resulting in the reopening of the border in July and the announcement of the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries on August 16.

United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld played an active role in this regard. One of the stated purposes of his recent visit to the Middle East was to promote the improvement of relations between the two countries. The US Ambassador to Jordan also showed great concern for the talks between the UAR and Jordan. As early as May 26, the London "Times" revealed that "the Americans asked King Hussein to reach an understanding with Cairo for his own good and the general good."

Foreign journalists here have noted that since President Nasser retaliated against Israel's provocative remarks on July 26, a propaganda campaign fiercely opposing Israel, the traditional enemy of the Arabs, has continued to appear in newspapers. They believe that this is clearly intended to help strengthen relations with other Arab countries on the eve of the Casablanca Conference.

### 在阿拉伯联盟会议开幕前夕　阿联力图改善同一些阿拉伯国家关系

　　在阿拉伯联盟会议开幕前夕
　　阿联力图改善同一些阿拉伯国家关系
    新华社开罗17日电　由于阿拉伯联盟理事会卡萨布兰卡会议即将在9月初召开，阿联正在努力改善它同其它阿拉伯国家的关系，特别是改善同两个长时期亲西方的国家约旦和突尼斯的关系。
    在促使阿联和约旦最近恢复外交关系一事上起了重要作用的阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳，在这次去突尼斯访问之前，于16日启程前往利比亚。利比亚是照管突尼斯在阿联的利益的国家。上月这里宣布，阿联和突尼斯已经在利比亚进行了接触，以备恢复关系。
    阿联和突尼斯是在1958年10月断绝关系的。当时突尼斯出席阿拉伯联盟某次会议的代表指责联盟成为一个为一种利益和受一个成员国支配的组织而同阿联闹翻。
    今年4月，哈苏纳向报界宣布，阿联准备“在阿拉伯联盟的范围内同突尼斯合作。”摩洛哥和利比亚接着开始了斡旋活动。
    阿联同突尼斯进行的直接接触是通过阿联埃及地区国民议会副议长法德·加拉勒进行的。加拉勒利用他5月间在突尼斯参加全非人民大会总务委员会会议的机会，同突尼斯总统布尔吉巴举行了三次会议。但是，据悉，在恢复两国之间的关系之前仍有某种困难需要沟通。突尼斯要求阿联作出不干涉的保证，而后者认为不存在干涉突尼斯事务的问题。
    同约旦恢复关系的过程比较顺利。阿联同约旦的关系是在去年7月阿联承认伊拉克共和国以后破裂的，从今年5月约旦的马贾利内阁执政以来，两国的关系更加恶化。直到今年6月，阿联一直封锁着同约旦的边境，而约旦在很大程度上依靠从黎巴嫩取道阿联叙利亚地区输入货物。
    经过黎巴嫩的调停（因为黎巴嫩在改善阿联和约旦关系问题上有直接的经济利益），阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳作了安曼之行，结果在7月重新开放边境，8月16日宣布恢复了两国之间的外交关系。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在这方面起了积极的作用。他最近访问中东时宣布的目的之一是促进改善这两个国家的关系。美国驻约旦大使也对阿联和约旦的会谈表现甚为关心。早在5月26日，伦敦“泰晤士报”就透露，“美国人要求侯赛因国王为他自己的和总的好处而同开罗达成谅解”。
    这里的外国记者注意到自从纳赛尔总统7月26日对以色列的挑衅性言论进行反击以来，报纸上继续出现猛烈反对阿拉伯的传统敌人以色列的宣传运动。他们认为，这显然是希望能有助于在卡萨布兰卡会议前夕加强同其它阿拉伯国家之间的关系。
