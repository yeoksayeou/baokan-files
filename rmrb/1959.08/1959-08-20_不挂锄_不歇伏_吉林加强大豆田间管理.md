　　Never Stop Hoeing, Never Rest During the Dog Days
　　Jilin Strengthens Field Management of Soybeans

    Xinhua News Agency report: The broad masses of farmers in Jilin Province are further strengthening the late-stage field management of soybeans, striving to exceed production targets and produce more soybeans for the country.

    This year, Jilin Province planted over 13 million mu of soybeans. Due to deep plowing and close planting, reasonable fertilization, and timely cultivation, especially with the balanced rainfall since July, the soybeans are growing particularly vigorously. Generally, the soybeans have grown to over two chi (Chinese feet) tall, with more branches than in previous years, thick and strong stems and leaves, and fresh bean pods are increasing day by day.

    According to past habits, this is usually the time for farmers to stop hoeing, rest during the hot days, and wait for the harvest. However, this year, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the province's farmers are determined to increase soybean production, utilizing the resting time to strengthen late-stage field management. Various regions have generally increased the number of cultivation passes, focusing on applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to promote more pods, full grains, and early maturity; for soybeans that are growing too vigorously, topping and removing bottom leaves are done to improve ventilation and light penetration; various regions have also dug drainage ditches, removed weeds from field edges to avoid waterlogging and pests. Currently, soybeans in the Jilin area have generally been cultivated twice and fertilized once, with over 460,000 mu of soybeans fertilized twice. (Attached picture)

    The Xinzhuang No. 2 Production Team of the Xinzhuang Management Area of the Xinzhuang People's Commune in Yushu County, Jilin Province, is seizing the time to cultivate the soybean fields for the fourth time.

　　不挂锄　不歇伏
　　吉林加强大豆田间管理
    据新华社讯　吉林省广大农民，正在进一步加强大豆的后期田间管理，力争超过包产指标，为国家生产更多的大豆。
    吉林省今年播种的一千三百多万亩大豆，由于深耕密植，合理施肥，及时铲趟，特别是7月以来雨水调匀，因此都长得特别茂盛。现在一般大豆都已长到二尺多高，比往年生杈多，枝叶粗壮，鲜嫩的豆荚正在一天天增多。
    按照往年的习惯，目前正是农民挂锄歇伏、只等收获的时候。但是，今年全省农民在各级党委的领导下决心增产更多的大豆，都利用歇伏时间，加强大豆的后期田间管理。各地普遍增加了铲趟遍数，重点追施磷钾肥料，促进荚多粒饱和早熟；对贪青的大豆掐尖和打底叶，以便通风透光；各地还开挖排水沟，铲除地边杂草，避免水患和虫害。现在，吉林地区的大豆已普遍铲趟两遍，追肥一遍，有四十六万多亩大豆追了两遍肥。（附图片）
