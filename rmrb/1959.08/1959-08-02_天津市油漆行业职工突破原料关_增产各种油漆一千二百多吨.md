    Tianjin Municipality Paint Industry Workers Break Through Raw Material Bottleneck
    Increase Production of Various Paints by Over 1,200 Tons

    (Our dispatch) The vast number of workers in the Tianjin Municipality paint industry, vigorously promoting technical revolution and technical innovation, have saved large quantities of glycerin, rosin, calcium carbonate, and industrial oil, increasing the production of various paints by over 1,200 tons. The product quality is good, and there is a wide variety of colors and types.

    The paint industry in Tianjin produces more than sixty types of paint and over eight hundred colors. There are high-grade industrial paints for automobiles and airplanes, as well as civilian paints for doors, windows, and bicycles. These paints are sold throughout the country. Since the beginning of this year, various paint factories have launched a production increase and economy drive centered on technical revolution and technical innovation. During this drive, the China Paint Branch Factory and the Oriental Paint Branch Factory used coumarone resin, a byproduct of coking, to replace glycerin stearate, increasing the production of enamel, anti-rust paint, blending paint, and other industrial paints by 584 tons. They used rapeseed oil and miscellaneous oils to replace soybean oil and flaxseed oil, increasing the production of thick architectural paint by more than 300 tons, reducing costs by more than 20,000 yuan. Workers at the Yongming Paint Branch Factory successfully trial-produced more than 8,700 jin of oleic acid drying agent, replacing more than 10,000 jin of acid-resistant drying agent, and produced more than 3,800 tons of high-grade paint, ensuring the supply of paint for key national projects.

    To maintain the quality of paint, workers in various paint factories have established a tiered inspection system at the factory, workshop, and team levels, as well as a post-inspection system for technical personnel and production workers. They also stipulated that the first batch of each product must undergo detailed laboratory testing, especially paint for key projects, which must be tested by the ordering unit in advance. Only if the quality requirements are met can mass production begin. Through this series of quality inspection and review systems, most of the paint produced in the first half of this year maintained the highest quality levels of 1958. Among them, insulating paint, anti-rust paint, enamel, spray paint, and blending paint were improved compared to the highest quality levels of 1958.

    In the first half of this year, the workers of the Tianjin paint industry, in the absence of technical data and insufficient equipment conditions, successfully trial-produced 21 new products, including high-temperature insulation paint, high-temperature paint, high-strength enameled wire paint, textured art spray paint, hot spray paint, ship bottom paint, and wash primer. More than a dozen of these new products had never been produced in China before. About ten of these new products have been put into production, and costs have also been reduced. For hot spray paint alone, if calculated at an annual output of 5,000 tons, more than 14 million yuan can be saved per year.

    In order to produce more and better paint, the workers of various paint factories in Tianjin have worked hard to tap the potential of production equipment and improve equipment. After more than half a year of efforts, many factories have realized the pipelining of paint, spraying, oil, and solvents, the continuous grinding, and the automation of operations. In the past, the workshops of the Yongming Paint Branch Factory used buckets and manual operations for sending paint and adding materials, which was inefficient and wasted a lot of raw materials. After the pipelining was realized, efficiency was improved, and waste during transportation was eliminated. Previously, the grinding team of the China Paint Branch Factory used seven three-roller grinding machines, operated by ten people per shift. After realizing continuous grinding, the number of people per shift was reduced by seven, and labor efficiency was increased by three to four times. (Attached photo)

    天津市油漆行业职工突破原料关
    增产各种油漆一千二百多吨
    本报讯　天津市油漆行业的广大职工，大搞技术革命和技术革新，节约了大量甘油、松香、碳酸钙和工业用油，增产一千二百多吨油漆，产品质量良好，花色品种繁多。
    天津市油漆行业生产的油漆有六十多种、八百多种颜色，有汽车、飞机用的高级工业用漆，也有门窗、自行车等民用油漆，这些油漆行销全国各地。今年以来，各油漆厂开展了以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动。在运动中，中国油漆分厂和东方油漆分厂，以炼焦副产品——库马龙树脂代替甘油硬脂，增产了磁漆、防锈漆、调和漆等工业用漆五百八十四吨，以菜子杂油代替豆油和胡麻油，增产建筑用厚漆三百多吨，降低成本二万多元。永明油漆分厂职工试制成功了八千七百多斤油酸干料，代替耐酸干料一万多斤，生产了三千八百多吨高级用漆，保证了国家重点工程用漆。
    各油漆厂职工为了保持油漆的质量，建立了工厂、车间、小组层层逐级检查，和技术人员、生产工人的岗位检查制度；同时还规定了每种产品的第一批产品，一定要进行详细化验检查，特别是重点工程用漆，都事先交给订货单位试验，合乎质量要求，才成批生产。通过这一系列的质量检验和审查制度，今年上半年生产的油漆，绝大多数都保持了1958年最高质量的水平，其中绝缘漆、防锈漆、磁漆、喷漆、调合漆等五种，比1958年最高质量水平还有所提高。
    今年上半年，天津油漆行业的职工，在缺乏技术资料和设备条件不足的情况下，试制成功了耐高温绝缘漆、高温漆、高强度漆包线漆、凸纹美术喷漆、热喷漆、船底漆、洗涤底漆等二十一种新产品，其中有十几种是我国从来没有生产过的品种。这些新产品中已有十来种产品投入了生产，成本也有所降低，仅热喷漆一项，如果以年产五千吨计算，一年可节约一千四百多万元。
    为了生产又多又好的油漆，天津各油漆厂职工，努力发掘生产设备潜力，改进设备。经过半年多的努力，许多厂实现了油漆、喷漆、油料、溶剂等管道化、研磨连续化、操作自动化。永明油漆分厂各车间，由于过去送漆加料都用桶和手工操作，效率低，浪费不少原材料；实现管道化后，提高了效率，消灭了输送时的浪费现象。中国油漆分厂的研磨小组，以前七台三滚研磨机，每班十个人操作，实现研磨连续化以后，每班减少了七个人，劳动效率提高了三、四倍。（附图片）
