The Tianshui Area Promotes the Experience of the Wushilipu Branch to Strengthen the Combat Effectiveness of Rural Party Branches
Demanding that all regions thoroughly conduct current situation education in the process of promotion, summarize the rural branch work of the entire area, improve branch leadership methods, and further set off a high tide of agricultural production.
    (By our newspaper) The Tianshui area is vigorously promoting the leadership experience of the Wushilipu Production Team Party Branch of the Jiekou People's Commune in Tianshui City among the rural Party grassroots organizations, in order to further improve the leadership level of the Party's grassroots organizations in the entire area and better exert the role of the rural branches as fighting fortresses.
    In leading production and completing various work tasks, the Wushilipu Party Branch first adhered to the mass line working method of "from the masses, to the masses." When promoting advanced experiences and adopting a major measure, they always adhered to the method of boldly mobilizing the masses and everything through experimentation, using the masses' personal experience to educate the masses, so that the masses were sincerely convinced to accept new technical measures. In its leadership work, the branch paid special attention to humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and accepting their criticisms.
    Secondly, the Jiekou People's Commune Wushilipu Production Team Party Branch of the CPC has done a very good job in all its work because it regularly paid attention to conducting systematic political and ideological education for Party members and commune members. This branch has grasped ideological education in every movement. During the period of cooperativization, they educated the commune members about organizing themselves to take the road to collective prosperity, which stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for organizing themselves. After cooperativization, individual commune members developed capitalist ideas. The Party branch often conducted education for Party members and the masses through Party classes and spare-time schools, explaining the superiority of cooperativization and the correct relationship between collective interests and individual interests, which further strengthened the commune members' determination to take the socialist road. After the people's commune was established, the Party branch educated the commune members on the superiority of communization and the prospects of communism, so that they further clarified the guidelines and policies for building socialism.
    Thirdly, the Wushilipu Party Branch paid attention to giving play to the exemplary vanguard role of Party members in all its work, and fully exerted the assistant role of the Youth League organization, conscientiously implementing various policies and work tasks, and thus achieved great success in its work.
    In order to further improve the leadership methods of the rural branches in the entire area, improve the leadership level, strengthen combat effectiveness, and give full play to the role of fortresses, the Tianshui area has taken measures to universally promote the leadership experience of the Wushilipu Branch in the rural Party grassroots organizations throughout the area. The prefectural committee demanded that, through the promotion of experience, a current situation education be thoroughly conducted for all grassroots cadres and Party members, and combined with study, a summary of the rural branch work in the entire area should be carried out, the branch leadership methods should be improved, the branch leadership level should be improved, and a high tide of agricultural production should be further launched. Since the beginning of July, the CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee and the county and municipal committees have universally issued the leadership experience of the Wushilipu Branch to the general branches of the people's communes and the branches of the production teams throughout the area. Wu Zhiguo, the first secretary of the prefectural committee, personally convened a telephone conference, instructing the county and municipal committees to strengthen leadership, learn this experience well, and summarize the local branch work well. The eight county and municipal committees in the entire area have determined to select 200 to 500 production team branches from more than 5,000 production teams in 127 communes as key points, and the county and municipal committees have assigned special personnel to help summarize the experience. Through summarizing experience, combined with the Party's guidelines and policies, the branch work materials are compiled and used to educate all Party members. The entire area is preparing to train 4,000 grassroots cadres within the year. In addition to the branch instructors, most of these personnel are grassroots cadres who do not leave their posts. Huicheng, Wushan, Wenxian, and Qin'an counties convened meetings of commune party committee secretaries, general branch secretaries, and branch secretaries, which were personally presided over by the first secretary, to study the Wushilipu experience. Combined with the study, an analysis was made of the local grassroots organization work, and further discussions were held on strengthening grassroots leadership, strengthening political and ideological education, and other issues. Qingshui, Qin'an, and other places transferred more than 30 cadres to specifically summarize the experience of branch work.
    Through the promotion of the Wushilipu experience, the Tianshui area has greatly improved the leadership level of the branches. The 24 Party members of the Shili Pu Production Team Branch of the Chengguan Commune in Tianshui City have become more energetic after studying. In the struggle against floods, they led more than 200 people to fight hard for four days and recovered the crops that were flooded. After learning, the Zhongchuan Production Team Branch of the Yanguan Commune in Xili County further improved the various systems of the branch, and mobilized all Party members and the masses to study various measures to achieve high yields, making the autumn field management work meticulous and good. After learning, the Rongsheng Team Branch of the Chengguan Commune in Wushan County summarized the effective experience in the Great Leap Forward last year, carried out competitions, and organized more than 150 people to go to the mountains to camp and apply topdressing to more than 150 mu of corn in three days.

　　天水地区推广五十里铺支部经验
　　加强农村党支部的战斗力
　　要求各地在推广过程中深入开展当前形势教育，总结全区农村支部工作，改进支部领导方法，进一步掀起农业生产高潮
    本报讯　天水地区在农村党的基层组织中，大力推广天水市耤口人民公社五十里铺生产队党支部的领导经验，以便进一步提高全区党的基层组织的领导水平，更好的发挥农村支部的战斗堡垒作用。
    五十里铺党支部在领导生产和完成各项工作任务中，首先坚持了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法。当推广先进经验和采取一项重大措施的时候，总是坚持了放手发动群众，一切经过试验的办法，用群众的亲身体验，来教育群众。使群众心悦诚服地接受新的技术措施。支部在领导工作中，特别注意虚心听取群众的意见，接受群众的批评。
    其次中共耤口人民公社五十里铺生产队支部，由于经常注意对党员和社员进行系统的政治思想教育工作，各项工作都搞得很好。这个支部在历次运动中，都抓紧了思想教育。合作化时期，他们对社员进行了组织起来走集体富裕道路的教育，激发了群众要求组织起来的积极性。合作化后，个别社员滋长了资本主义思想，党支部经常通过党课、业余学校对党员和群众进行教育，讲明合作化的优越性，集体利益与个人利益的正确关系，更加坚定了社员走社会主义道路的决心。人民公社化后，党支部对社员又进行了公社化的优越性和共产主义前景的教育，使他们进一步明确了建设社会主义的方针、政策。
    第三，五十里铺党支部在各项工作中注意发挥党员的先锋战士作用，并充分发挥团组织的助手作用，认真地贯彻执行各项政策和工作任务，因而在工作中取得很大成绩。
    为了进一步改进全区农村支部的领导方法，提高领导水平，加强战斗力，充分发挥堡垒作用，天水地区已经采取措施，在全区范围内农村党的基层组织中，普遍推广五十里铺支部的领导经验。地委要求，通过推广经验，深入地向全体基层干部和党员进行一次当前形势的教育，并结合学习，对全区农村支部工作进行一次总结，改进支部领导方法，提高支部领导水平，进一步开展农业生产高潮。从7月上旬开始，中共天水地委和各县、市委，曾先后给全区各人民公社总支和生产队的支部，普遍印发了五十里铺支部的领导经验。地委第一书记吴治国亲自召开电话会议，指示各县、市委加强领导，学好这个经验，并总结好当地支部工作。全区的八个县、市委确定在一百二十七个公社的五千多个生产队中，选择二百到五百个生产队支部作为重点，由县、市委指派专人帮助总结经验。通过总结经验，结合党的方针政策，分编成支部工作教材，向全体党员进行教育。全区准备在年内训练基层干部四千名，这些人员除了支部教员外，绝大部分是不脱产的基层干部。徽成、武山、文县、秦安等县召开了公社党委书记、总支书记、支部书记会议，由第一书记亲自主持，学习五十里铺经验。结合学习，对当地基层组织工作情况作了分析，进一步讨论了加强基层领导，加强政治思想教育等问题。清水、秦安等地抽调干部三十多人，专门总结支部工作经验。
    天水地区通过推广五十里铺经验。大大提高了支部领导水平。天水市城关公社十里铺生产队支部的二十四名党员，通过学习，干劲更大，他们与洪水斗争中，领导二百多群众，苦战四天，夺回了被洪水淹掉的庄稼。西礼县盐官公社中川生产队支部学习后，进一步健全了支部各项制度，并发动全体党员和群众一起研究实现高产的各项措施，使秋田管理工作又细又好。武山县城关公社荣胜队支部学习后，总结了去年大跃进中行之有效的经验，开展了竞赛，组织了一百五十多人上山扎营，在三天内给一百五十多亩包谷施了追肥。
