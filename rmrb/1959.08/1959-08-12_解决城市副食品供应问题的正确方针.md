　　Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held the National Conference on the Production of Non-Staple Foods and Handicraft Products in Large and Medium-Sized Cities in Shanghai from June 18th to 23rd, and put forward the policy of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for external assistance as a supplement," the production of non-staple foods in many cities has already seen initial and significant improvements. Under the leadership of the Party committee, relevant departments in major and medium-sized cities have formulated comprehensive production plans, mobilized suburban farmers, urban organizations, schools, groups, troops, factories, and residents to engage in non-staple food production, and made arrangements for labor, feed land, breeding of livestock, and training of breeders. Cities that started early have seen significant expansion in vegetable planting areas and significant increases in the number of poultry and livestock raised. The Party's policy of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for external assistance as a supplement" has been warmly embraced by the vast numbers of people in urban and rural areas, and they have taken active action. Countless facts have proven that this policy is practical and feasible, and it is a correct policy for solving the problem of non-staple food supply in large and medium-sized cities.
　　What is the fundamental way to solve the problem of non-staple food supply? This is to give equal importance to both urban and rural areas and actively develop the production of non-staple foods. On the one hand, in the vast rural areas, we must continue to implement the policy of vigorously developing non-staple food production; on the other hand, in large and medium-sized cities, we must resolutely implement the policy of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for external assistance as a supplement." According to the recent implementation in major and medium-sized cities: It is entirely possible to establish strong non-staple food bases in the suburbs of cities in a planned way, to achieve basic self-sufficiency in vegetables, and to gradually and separately achieve complete self-sufficiency, or basic self-sufficiency, or substantial self-sufficiency in oil, pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, goose, eggs, and aquatic products, depending on local conditions. Large and medium-sized cities and suburbs not only have the conditions to do so, but also have very good conditions. Now, most urban suburbs have expanded compared to the past, and the area of cultivated land and the agricultural population have increased. According to statistics from 37 large and medium-sized cities, the ratio of urban population to suburban population is on average one to one point two seven, and the total average cultivated land area per capita in urban and suburban areas is 1.65 mu. Many cities are surrounded by mountains and rivers, with large areas of cultivated land, as well as mountains, forests, lakes and rivers, or the sea. These geographical conditions can be used for us to grow a large number of vegetables and raise a large number of pigs, cattle, sheep, rabbits, chickens, geese, and ducks, and fish. Cities have concentrated populations and abundant fertilizer sources, which can be fully utilized to develop non-staple food production in the suburbs. Urban industry is relatively developed, and suburbs can get support from cities in agricultural technology reform and irrigation. This is much better than the conditions in general rural areas. The principle of thrift is one of the principles that must be followed in the development of the economy in socialist society. Establishing non-staple food production bases in the suburbs, compared to transporting all kinds of fresh and live commodities such as vegetables, fish, shrimps, live pigs, and poultry from other places from thousands of miles away, can save transportation capacity, and avoid or reduce commodity losses such as pig deaths, egg spoilage, and vegetable rot, and can ensure that cities eat relatively fresh food.
　　Of course, our general policy for developing non-staple food production is to give equal importance to both urban and rural areas. The implementation of the policy of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for external assistance as a supplement" in large and medium-sized cities cannot and should not weaken the production of non-staple foods in the vast rural areas. Because it takes a process for cities to achieve self-sufficiency in non-staple foods, and it takes a certain amount of time for emerging cities and industrial and mining areas to achieve self-sufficiency; at the same time, there are many varieties of non-staple foods. In addition to vegetables, poultry, livestock, and aquatic products, there are also various local specialties such as winter bamboo shoots, wood ears, winter mushrooms, and seafood. The production of these local specialties is restricted by natural conditions such as climate, soil, and water conservancy, and it is impossible to plant or raise them universally throughout the country. Therefore, not only is it necessary for rural areas to support cities with non-staple foods and to carry out material exchanges between regions at present, but it will also be indispensable in the future. The original non-staple food production bases outside the urban suburbs must continue to be strengthened, the self-sufficient production and commodity production of non-staple foods in rural areas must have greater development, and the procurement and allocation plans for non-staple foods in rural areas must be resolutely implemented. The rural areas' support of the cities with non-staple foods not only meets the needs of the urban people's lives, but also meets the needs of the farmers to exchange agricultural and sideline products for daily industrial products and means of production. In the continuous development of socialist construction, mutual assistance and cooperation between urban and rural areas can only develop day by day, and there should be no weakening in any aspect.
　　To achieve self-sufficiency or basic self-sufficiency in non-staple foods in cities, it is necessary to clarify the production policy of the suburbs. The suburbs of cities mainly produce non-staple foods for the cities. However, what to produce should be based on different conditions and adapted to local conditions. There should also be a distinction between near suburbs and far suburbs. Generally speaking, near suburbs should focus on the production of vegetables, while also producing other non-staple foods; far suburbs should generally focus on the production of grain, cotton, oil crops and other cash crops, while comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. We must not only implement diversified management, but also focus on developing pig raising, sheep raising, and aquaculture to meet the needs of cities. When developing non-staple food production, we must take vegetables and pork as the key link to drive other aspects and promote comprehensive development. In ethnic minority areas where pork is not eaten, vegetables and beef and mutton should be taken as the key link. In terms of vegetables, except for a few special varieties, it is necessary to achieve local production and local supply. First of all, we must grasp the production of vegetables with the largest consumption volume, and at the same time, we should try to diversify the varieties as much as possible and meet different requirements in all aspects. In terms of meat, we must focus on raising pigs (or cattle and sheep), while striving to raise other livestock and poultry. Suburbs with more mountains, forests and grasslands should also plant fruit trees and raise livestock. Suburbs with more water surfaces should also pay attention to developing aquaculture.
　　In developing non-staple food production in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities, it is necessary to implement the policy of giving equal importance to both public and private sectors and walking on two legs, that is, to develop both state-owned and collective economic non-staple food production, and to encourage commune members to raise poultry and livestock and engage in other non-staple food production. In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of commune member families for raising poultry and livestock, we must help them solve the problem of feed land and strictly implement the procurement policies stipulated by the Party and the state. In the non-staple food production in the suburbs, state-owned farms and ranches have more favorable conditions than the collective production of the communes. As long as they are managed well, they can greatly increase the output and commodity rate, and can promote the production of suburban communes. Therefore, we must actively, systematically and gradually expand the non-staple food production of state-owned farms and ranches and increase their proportion in non-staple food production. Organizations, groups, factories, schools, troops and other units in the city should also, according to possible conditions, use spare time and vacant land in the suburbs to plant vegetables and raise poultry and livestock, either independently or jointly. We must fully mobilize all available land, manpower and material resources to vigorously develop non-staple food production.
　　While developing non-staple food production in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities, we must do a good job in the purchase and supply of non-staple foods, and do a good job in the processing and storage of vegetables. Commercial departments must frequently and closely link producers and consumers, and in accordance with the possibilities of production and the needs of consumers, on the one hand, purchase in a timely manner to promote the development of production, and on the other hand, rationally allocate and arrange commodities to facilitate consumers as much as possible. The production of vegetables is restricted by the season, so in the peak production season, it is necessary to mobilize production departments, commercial departments and consumers to start processing and storing together to ensure the supply of vegetables in the off-season.
　　Developing non-staple food production on a large scale in the suburbs is a new task for many large and medium-sized cities. Technical strength and material strength may not be very abundant at the beginning. However, under the leadership of the Party committees in various places, as long as we are full of energy, make persistent efforts, earnestly mobilize the masses, earnestly implement the Party's correct policy for solving non-staple food production, and adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, we will surely be able to overcome various difficulties and make great strides forward. Let us summon up revolutionary vigor, and with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, seize the months of August and September, and on the basis of the preliminary achievements we have already achieved, further improve the production and supply of non-staple foods, and use the new achievements in non-staple food production and supply to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

### 解决城市副食品供应问题的正确方针

　　解决城市副食品供应问题的正确方针
    自从中共中央于6月18日到23日在上海召开的全国大中城市副食品和手工业品生产会议，提出了“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针以来，许多城市副食品的生产情况已经有了初步的显著改进。各大中城市有关部门在党委的领导下，制订生产的全面规划，发动郊区农民、市区机关、学校、团体、部队、工厂和居民投入副食品生产，并对劳动力、饲料地、种畜繁殖、饲养人员培训等工作，都作了安排。动手早的城市，蔬菜种植面积已有显著扩大，家禽、家畜的饲养数量已有显著增加。党的“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，得到城乡广大人民的热烈拥护，并积极行动起来。无数事实证明，这个方针是切实可行的，是一个解决大中城市副食品供应问题的正确方针。
    什么是解决副食品供应问题的根本途径呢？这就是城乡并举，积极发展副食品的生产。一方面在广大农村，继续执行大力发展副食品生产的方针；另一方面，在大中城市，坚决执行“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针。最近从各大中城市执行的情况来看：在城市郊区有计划地建立强大的副食品基地，做到蔬菜基本自给，并且根据各地不同条件、逐步地分别地做到油、猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、蛋和水产的全部自给，或者基本自给，或者大部自给，是完全可能的。大中城市和郊区不但有条件来办，而且条件很好。现在大多数城市郊区比过去都扩大了，耕地面积和农业人口都已增加。据三十七个大中城市的统计，市区人口与郊区人口的比例平均是一比一点二七，市区与郊区人口总平均耕地面积，每人是一亩六分五厘。不少城市依山傍水，有大片的耕地，还有山林，有湖泊和江河，或者大海。这些地理条件，可以供我们大量种菜，大量养猪、养牛、养羊、养兔、养鸡、养鹅、养鸭、养鱼。城市人口集中，肥源充足，在郊区发展副食品生产，可以充分利用。城市工业比较发达，郊区在农业技术改革、水利灌溉方面，都可以就近得到城市的支援。这比起一般农村来，条件就好得多了。节约的原则，是社会主义社会发展经济必须遵守的原则之一。在郊区建立副食品生产基地，比起千里迢迢从外地调运全部蔬菜、鱼虾、生猪、家禽等鲜活商品来，一则可以节省运输力量，二则可以避免或者减少猪死、蛋臭、菜烂等商品损耗，三则可以保证城市吃到比较鲜嫩的东西。
    当然，我们发展副食品生产的总方针是城乡并举。在大中城市实行“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，丝毫不能也不应当削弱广大农村副食品的生产。因为城市实现副食品自给需要一个过程，而新兴的城市、工矿区更需要一定的时间方能实现自给；同时，副食品的品种繁多，除了蔬菜、家禽、家畜、水产等大宗的以外，还有冬笋、木耳、冬菇、海味等等各式各样的土特产品。这些土特产品的生产受着气候、土壤、水利等自然条件的限制，不可能在全国范围内普遍种植或饲养。所以，不只是在目前仍需要农村以副食品支援城市，需要地区之间进行物资交流，就是在将来，也缺少不了。城市郊区以外原有的副食品生产基地必须继续加强，农村副食品的自给性生产和商品性生产必须有更大的发展，农村副食品的收购和调拨计划必须坚决执行。农村以副食品支援城市，不仅符合城市人民生活的需要，而且也符合农民以农副产品换取日用工业品和生产资料的要求。在社会主义建设不断发展的过程中，城乡互助，城乡合作，只能一天天发展，而不能在任何方面有一点点的削弱。
    要做到城市副食品自给或基本自给，必须明确郊区的生产方针。城市郊区主要是为城市生产副食品。但是，究竟生产什么，就应当根据不同的条件因地制宜。近郊区与远郊区也应当有所区别。一般地说，近郊区应当以生产蔬菜为主，同时生产其他副食品；远郊区应当大体上以生产粮食、棉花、油料和其他经济作物为主，同时全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔业，既要实行多种经营，又要着重发展养猪、养羊和水产业，满足城市需要。在发展副食品生产的时候，要以蔬菜和猪肉为纲，带动其他，全面发展。在不吃猪肉的少数民族地区，则以蔬菜和牛羊肉为纲。在蔬菜方面，除了少数特殊品种以外，必须做到就地生产就地供应，首先抓消费量最大的蔬菜的生产，同时尽可能地使品种多样化，尽可能满足各方面不同的要求。在肉食方面，要以养猪（或牛羊）为重点，同时努力饲养其他家畜家禽。山林草地较多的郊区，还要种植果树和牧畜。水面较多的郊区，还要注意发展水产事业。
    在大中城市郊区发展副食品生产，必须执行公私并举、两条腿走路的政策，既要发展国营和集体经济的副食品生产，又要鼓励社员个人饲养家禽家畜和进行其他副食品的生产。为了充分调动社员家庭饲养家禽家畜的积极性，一定要帮助他们解决饲料地，一定要严格执行党和国家规定的收购政策。在郊区副食品生产中，国营农牧场比之公社的集体生产具有更为优越的条件，只要办得好，就可以大大提高产量和商品率，并可以推动郊区公社的生产。因此，我们必须积极地有计划地逐步扩大国营农牧场的副食品生产，增加它们在副食品生产上的比重。城市中的机关、团体、工厂、学校、部队等单位，也应当根据可能的条件，利用业余时间，利用郊区空闲土地，种植蔬菜和饲养家禽家畜，或者单独经营，或者合伙经营。我们要把一切可以利用的土地、人力和物力，都充分调动起来，大力发展副食品生产。
    在大中城市郊区发展副食品生产的同时，必须做好副食品的收购供应工作，做好蔬菜的加工贮藏。商业部门要经常地密切生产者和消费者的联系，按照生产的可能和消费者的需要，一方面及时地收购，促进生产的发展，一方面合理地分配和布置商品，尽可能便利消费者。蔬菜的生产受着季节的限制，所以在生产旺季，一定要发动生产部门、商业部门和消费者一齐动手加工贮藏，保证淡季的蔬菜供应。
    在郊区大量发展副食品生产，对于许多大中城市来讲，是一项新的工作，技术力量和物质力量，在开始的时候，可能是不很充裕的。但是，在各地党委的领导下，只要我们干劲冲天，再接再厉，认真发动群众，认真贯彻执行党的解决副食品生产的正确方针，坚持执行勤俭办一切事业的原则，就一定能够战胜种种困难，大踏步前进。让我们鼓足革命干劲，以苦干、实干、巧干的精神，抓紧8、9两月，在已经获得的初步成绩的基础上，进一步做好副食品的生产和供应工作，用副食品生产和供应的新成就来迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
