Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 30th (via TASS): TASS's special correspondent in Geneva reports: When Herter met with Gromyko on July 29th and tried to get the latter to agree to end the conference on August 5th and turn the Foreign Ministers' conference into a Deputy Ministers' conference, thereby leaving the issues on the agenda unresolved, the Soviet delegation took a different attitude. It insisted on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement as soon as possible on the unresolved issues of principle.

Why were the Western delegations in such a hurry to leave Geneva without resolving the tasks facing the conference? The problem lies in the fact that it was already very difficult for the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to defend their positions, especially their proposal on the West Berlin issue made on June 16th. This proposal meant perpetuating the occupation regime in West Berlin.

A few days ago, the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France once again attempted to make their positions look better. On July 28th, they hurriedly revised the June 16th proposal and described it as a "new" proposal that catered to the Soviet position. However, the "new" proposal that has been revealed is still the same as the June 16th proposal, and even the wording is the same in terms of the main, decisive issue—the number of occupation troops in West Berlin. After the "new" plan was announced, the bourgeois newspapers began to clamor that the Western countries catered to the Soviet Union on the issue of the validity period of the Berlin temporary agreement. In the old plan, it was said that the temporary agreement would be valid "until Germany is reunified," while this time the plan said that it would only be valid for a certain period, namely five years, after which another foreign ministers' conference should be convened to study further measures to resolve the Berlin issue. What is the essence of the Western countries' proposal this time? They proposed that five years after the signing of the Berlin temporary agreement, one of the participants in the Geneva conference could make a request, and they could meet again. What would they meet for? Certainly not to discuss new and practical measures to normalize the situation in West Berlin, but to re-discuss the old measures stipulated in the agreement, which do not change the occupation status of West Berlin in any way. In short, the three Western countries suggested not making any changes to the Berlin situation, but to meet again in five years and start the discussion all over again. Such a mask cannot conceal the obvious unwillingness of the Western countries to reach an agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st (via TASS): The Soviet "Pravda," in commenting on the Geneva conference, reminded the Western foreign ministers that they must remember the world's people's ardent desire for the easing of international tensions, continue to seek ways to reach an agreement, and not treat sabotaging the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference as a game.

"Pravda" wrote that the Western countries do not want to take any measures in West Berlin now or in the future. They do not intend to reduce the number of troops stationed there and insist on forcing the Soviet Union to sign a document that stipulates their right to occupy West Berlin indefinitely. "Pravda" pointed out that in order to cover up all this, they are trying to carry out deceptive propaganda, saying that there are "new factors" in their position, which simply do not exist.

"Pravda" continued, however, the Western countries still cannot escape an irrefutable fact: the world public has been convinced during the Geneva conference that it is possible to reach an agreement on a series of important issues. It is not very difficult to eliminate the obstacles on the way to reaching an agreement without damaging the prestige of either side. Sober-minded people cannot understand and cannot agree with the Western countries' approach: refusing to reduce the number of troops stationed in West Berlin. This approach is refusing to make the minimum contribution expected to the easing of international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva: The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—Gromyko, Herter, Lloyd, and Couve de Murville—held a long meeting on the main issues of the Geneva conference on the 30th at the French delegation's residence.

Participating in the four foreign ministers' meeting were Zorin and Malik from the Soviet side; Merchant and Reinhardt from the American side; Reilly and Rumbold from the British side; and Lucet and Laloy from the French side.

    苏联舆论揭露西方破坏外长会议的真面目
    正告西方不要把外长会议当儿戏
    四国外长继续就会议主要问题进行商谈
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦30日讯：塔斯社驻日内瓦特派记者报道：7月29日赫脱会见葛罗米柯并竭力想使对方同意在8月5日结束会议并使外长级会议变成副部长级会议，从而使议程上的问题成为悬案时，苏联代表团就采取了另一种态度。它坚持就所留下来的未解决的原则性问题继续进行尽快达成协议的尝试。
    为什么西方国家代表团没有解决会议所面临的任务就急忙要离开日内瓦呢？问题在于美国、英国和法国的代表已经很难维护自己的立场，特别是自己在6月16日就西柏林问题提出的建议。这个建议意味着使西柏林占领制度永久化。
    几天以前，美国、英国和法国代表团再次企图使他们的立场表现得好看一些。7月28日，他们急急忙忙修改了6月16日的建议，并把它说成是迎合苏联立场的“新”建议。但是已经透露的“新”建议仍然是6月16日建议中的那些东西，在主要的具有决定意义的问题——西柏林占领军队人数问题上，内容和目的甚至连措词都是一样。“新”方案公布以后，资产阶级报纸就开始叫嚷：西方国家在柏林临时协定的有效期限问题上迎合了苏联。它们在旧方案中说，临时协定“在德国重新统一以前”一直有效，这一次的方案却说，它只是在一定的时期，即五年内有效，此后就应重新召开外长会议来研究解决柏林问题的进一步措施。西方国家这一次的建议实质上是什么呢？它们提出的柏林临时协定签订五周年以后，日内瓦会议参加者中有一方提出要求，他们就可以重新聚会。聚会来干什么呢？绝不是为了讨论使西柏林局势正常化的新的切实可行的措施，而是为了重新讨论协议中所规定的、实质上丝毫不改变西柏林占领地位的那些老措施。简单地说，西方三国建议不对柏林局势作任何改变，而五年以后重新聚会，重新开始从头来讨论一遍。这样的假面具不能掩饰西方国家明显地不愿达成协议的立场。
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：苏联“真理报”在评论日内瓦会议时提醒西方外长必须记住世界人民期待国际紧张局势缓和的热望，继续寻求达成协议的途径，而不要拿破坏日内瓦外长会议当作儿戏。
    “真理报”写道，西方国家不想在现在或将来在西柏林采取任何措施，它们不打算减少在那里的驻军人数，并且硬要苏联在一份规定给它们无限期占领西柏林的权利的文件上签字。“真理报”指出，为了掩盖这一切，它们竭力进行欺骗宣传，说在他们的立场方面有了“新因素”，而这是根本不存在的。
    “真理报”接着说，但是，西方国家仍然逃避不了一个确定不移的事实：世界公众在日内瓦会议过程中已经确信，就一系列重要问题达成协议是可能的。在毫不损害双方威信的情况下消除达成协议途径上的障碍，并不是十分困难的事情。头脑清醒的人们不能理解，也不能同意西方国家的这种做法：死不愿意减少驻西柏林的军队人数。这种做法就是死不愿意在缓和国际紧张局势方面作出人们所期待的最起码的贡献。
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联、美国、英国和法国的外交部长——葛罗米柯、赫脱、劳埃德和德姆维尔30日在法国代表团寓所就日内瓦会议的主要问题举行了长时间的会谈。
    参加四国外长会谈的，苏联方面有佐林和马立克；美国方面有麦钱特和莱因哈特；英国方面有赖利和朗博尔德；法国方面有吕赛和拉洛瓦。
