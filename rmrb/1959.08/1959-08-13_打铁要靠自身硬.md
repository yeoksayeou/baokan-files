　　To forge iron well, one must stand firmly on both feet, straighten one's back, and then strike down with the hammer, accurately hitting the iron. No matter how hard the iron is, it will be shaped as desired, into whatever form one wants.

　　Forging iron is like this, and leading work is even more so. The Party branch of the Heqian Management District in Chuxiong, Yunnan, is such a model. This Party branch has strong leadership, and its members often use the phrase "To forge iron, one must be strong" to encourage themselves, thus maintaining a vigorous revolutionary fighting spirit. This year, although they suffered a prolonged and severe drought, the people's thinking did not dry up. In addition to taking the lead in fighting the drought, they also adopted various forms to persuade and educate the masses, establishing the belief that man can conquer nature. The masses' praise for the communists there is: "With a mouth to speak, they consult with the masses on everything; with a pair of hands, they can take the lead in hard work in production!" The masses have learned from these living examples of "To forge iron, one must be strong", and everyone is full of confidence and vigor. No matter how severe the drought, it still obediently submits to these tough guys. As a result, not a single rice seedling died.

　　There are countless such Party branches and Communist Party members in the countryside. With such strong branches and members, they are invincible and ever-victorious!

### 打铁要靠自身硬

　　打铁要靠自身硬
    要把铁打好，两脚要站得牢牢的，腰杆挺起，而后一锤一锤地打下去，不偏不斜，正好打在铁上。不管怎样硬的铁，也会随心所欲，要打成什么样就打成什么样。
    打铁是这样，领导工作更是这样。云南楚雄河前管理区的党支部，就是这样的典范。这个党支部领导坚强，党员时常用“打铁要靠自身硬”这句话来勉励自己，因此始终保持着旺盛的革命斗志。今年，虽然遭到了持久的严重干旱，但人的思想却没有干旱。他们除了带头和干旱斗争外，还采取多种多样的形式，向群众进行说服教育，树立人定胜天的信念。群众对那里共产党员的赞词是：“有口一张，遇事和群众商量；有手一双，生产能够带头苦干！”群众纷纷向这些“打铁要靠自身硬”的活榜样学习，人人信心百倍，干劲十足。不管干旱怎样严重，还是乖乖地听命于这些硬汉。结果，稻苗没有干死一棵。
    像这样的党支部和共产党员，在农村何止千万。有着这样坚强的支部和党员，是无坚不摧，无往不胜的！
