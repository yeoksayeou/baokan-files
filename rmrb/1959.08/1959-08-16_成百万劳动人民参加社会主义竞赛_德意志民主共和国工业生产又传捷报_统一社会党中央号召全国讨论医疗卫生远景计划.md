    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 13th: According to materials released by the State Planning Commission of the German Democratic Republic on the evening of the 13th, national industrial production for the first seven months of this year increased by 12.7% compared to the same period last year.
    In July of this year, the completion of state plans by various factories and mining enterprises was generally better than in the first quarter and the first half of the year. As previously reported, industrial production in the first quarter of this year increased by 9.8% compared to the same period last year, and in the first half of this year increased by 12.4% compared to the same period last year.
    Among these seven months, the production of machine manufacturing, one of the most important industrial sectors, increased by 19% compared to the same period last year; the construction industry increased by 25.4%.
    The people's living standards have also improved, with retail sales in the first seven months of this year increasing by 11.7% compared to the same period last year.
    The State Planning Commission believes that the continuous increase in industrial production this year is due not only to the sufficient supply of raw materials and the expansion of production capacity, but more importantly, to the constantly rising production enthusiasm of the working people. In July, the number of workers in socialist enterprises participating in the labor emulation drive increased by another 60,000 compared to the previous month, reaching a total of 2,570,000. The number of production teams participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" reached 21,000, with a total of 240,000 people.
    In the movement to complete 80% of the annual production plan by October 7th to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day, more than 2.4 million workers have formulated collective and individual gift plans.

    The plan stipulates that various medical institutions, teaching and research institutions should be further expanded, the number of medical personnel should be increased, health propaganda and education should be strengthened, and outstanding research in medical and health work should be rewarded. By 1965, the number of doctors should be increased by at least 50%, and the number of mid-level medical personnel should be increased by 25%. The plan states that the state will continue to improve measures conducive to people's health, such as gradually shortening working hours, reducing heavy physical labor, comprehensively protecting labor, and arranging life.
    The long-range plan stipulates that the health of mothers, children, youth, and adults should be protected, and that the health of working women and the normal physical and mental development of children should be promoted.
    The plan also stipulates that all people should be encouraged to participate in sports activities and fight against alcoholism and excessive smoking.

    德意志民主共和国工业生产又传捷报
    统一社会党中央号召全国讨论医疗卫生远景计划
    新华社柏林电　据德意志民主共和国国家计划委员会13日晚上公布的材料，今年头七个月，全国工业生产比去年同时期增长了12.7％。
    今年7月份各厂矿企业完成国家计划的情况一般较第一季度和上半年好。前已报道，今年第一季度工业生产较去年同期增长了9.8％，今年上半年较去年同期增长了12.4％。

    人民生活消费水平也有所提高，今年头七个月商品零售额比去年同时期增加了11.7％。
    国家计划委员会认为，今年工业生产不断增加的原因，除由于原料供应充分和生产能力有所扩大以外，更重要的是由于劳动人民生产积极性的不断高涨。7月份，社会主义企业参加劳动竞赛的职工较上月又增加了六万人，总数已达到二百五十七万人。参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的生产队达到了二万一千个，总共有二十四万人。
    在为迎接国庆十周年而展开的到10月7日为止要完成全年生产计划80％的运动中，已有二百四十多万职工分别制定了集体和个人的献礼计划。
