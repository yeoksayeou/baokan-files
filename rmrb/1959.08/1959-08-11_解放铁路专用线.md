　　Liberating Railway Spur Lines
　　Jing Jiao
    Heilongjiang Province is promoting the work of "liberating railway spur lines," transforming spur lines from being "special-purpose." The so-called "liberating spur lines" means expanding the lines originally used solely by one enterprise for use by several nearby enterprises, with the original enterprise as the main user.
    This approach has the following benefits:
    I. When a spur line is used solely by one enterprise, the utilization rate is often not high. Shared use by several enterprises can fully leverage the capacity of the spur line. For example, the spur line of the Jiamusi Wood Processing Factory used to handle only 55,000 tons of goods per month when used independently; after being shared, it increased to 70,000 tons.
    II. Some enterprises need railway spur lines for production, but independent construction requires a large investment and the utilization rate is not high. Using the existing spur lines of nearby enterprises, or jointly constructing spur lines, can save a lot of investment. For example, the Jiamusi Xinsheng Machinery Factory originally planned to spend 450,000 yuan to build a spur line of more than two kilometers. Now that it uses the spur line of a nearby enterprise, this investment is saved entirely.
    III. Various enterprises loading and unloading goods at nearby spur lines can reduce the use of vehicles, save a lot of handling fees, and avoid excessive tension in short-distance transportation within the city. For example, after the spur line of the Jiamusi Wood Processing Factory was jointly used by more than thirty units nearby, the use of trucks and horse-drawn carts was reduced by 93,000 trips in eight months. The Xinsheng Machinery Factory alone saved 110,000 yuan in handling fees in five months this year.
    IV. Goods that were originally loaded and unloaded at the station can now mostly be loaded and unloaded at the spur lines, which reduces the burden on the station's freight lines and freight yards, and reduces the station's investment in this area. For example, the Jiamusi Station originally planned to expand the freight yard this year and lay hundreds of meters of freight car loading lines. Now that more than 160 enterprises in the city have switched to loading and unloading within 16 spur lines, the station not only does not need to expand, but the existing freight yard equipment also has a surplus.
    To promote this work, it is first necessary to break the thinking of enterprises that currently have spur lines that spur lines must be "special-purpose," fearing that sharing will affect the production of their own enterprises, and fearing that it will be inconvenient for their own use; secondly, it is necessary to correctly arrange plans based on the specific circumstances of each unit's loading and unloading of goods, and increase the necessary loading and unloading forces; third, establish some necessary management systems for the joint use of spur lines, such as fixing the units using the lines, dividing the sections used by each unit, and formulating methods for apportioning management and maintenance costs. All of this work can be done well as long as the local Party committee leads, strengthens the cooperation of various units.
    The experience of Heilongjiang proves that changing railway spur lines to be not "special-purpose" is a good way to solve transportation problems in industrial cities and mining areas. Other regions may also want to emulate this.

### 解放铁路专用线

　　解放铁路专用线
　　经交
    黑龙江省正在推行“解放铁路专用线”、变专用线为不“专用”的工作。所谓“解放专用线”，就是把原来由一个企业单独使用的线路，扩大为以这一企业为主、附近几个企业共同使用。
    这种做法有以下好处：
    一、原来由一个企业单独使用的时候，许多专用线利用率不高；几个企业共同使用，可以充分发挥专用线的能力。例如，佳木斯木材加工厂的专用线，单独使用时，每月只装卸五万五千吨物资；共同使用以后，增加到七万吨。
    二、有些企业生产中需要铁路专用线，但是单独建设，投资很大，利用率又不高；利用附近企业已经建成的专用线，或者几个企业共同建设专用线，就可以节省大量投资。例如，佳木斯新生机械厂本来计划用四十五万元修两公里多的一条专用线，现在使用了附近企业的专用线，这笔投资就全部省下来了。
    三、各企业都在附近的专用线装卸货物，可以少用车辆，节省大量搬运费，避免市内短途运输过分紧张。例如，佳木斯木材加工厂的专用线由附近三十几个单位共同使用以后，八个月就少用汽车、马车九万三千辆次。仅新生机械厂在今年五个月中，就节省搬运费十一万元。
    四、原来在车站装卸的货物，现在大部分可以改在专用线装卸，这就减轻了车站货物线和货场的负担，减少了车站在这方面的投资。例如，佳木斯车站原来计划今年扩建货场，铺几百米货物装车线；现在全市一百六十多个企业改在十六条专用线内装卸，车站不但不需要扩建，现有货场设备还有富余。
    推行这一工作，首先要打破现在有专用线的企业所谓专用线必须“专用”，怕共用会影响本企业的生产，怕自己用起来不方便等思想；其次要根据各单位装卸货物的具体情况正确安排计划，并增加必要的装卸力量；第三、建立一些必要的共同使用专用线的管理制度，例如固定使用的单位，划分各单位使用的地段，拟定管理和维修费用的分摊办法等。所有这些工作，只要有当地党委领导，加强各单位的协作，都是可以做好的。
    黑龙江的经验证明，变铁路专用线为不“专用”，是解决工业城市、工矿区运输问题的一项好办法。其他地区似乎也可以仿效一下。
