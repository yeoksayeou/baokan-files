Xinhua News Agency report: In Honghu County, Hubei Province, approximately 150,000 mu of farmland did not suffer from waterlogging damage this spring despite two instances of continuous rainfall totaling 180 millimeters. Since mid-June, although the county has not experienced a single soaking rain, these farmlands do not feel the lack of water, and some areas can even maintain self-flowing irrigation. In addition, a portion of farmland that has not been fully river-networked has also seen a significant reduction in the degree of waterlogging and drought compared to previous years due to the digging of some canals. This is the result of the river-networking water conservancy projects undertaken in Honghu County last winter and this spring.

Honghu County is located in the Jianghan Plain, bordered by the Yangtze River on three sides, and most of its territory is low-lying, making it prone to flooding. On the other hand, people, affected by flooding, did not have the habit of opening canals to store water and divert water for drought prevention. Thus, for many years, the area had to defend against floods when the water was high, drain waterlogging when there was excessive rain, and fight drought when the weather was clear. After liberation, the Honghu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party took a series of measures, leading the people of the county for several years to reinforce the Jianghan Main Embankment and build the Honghu Interceptor Dyke, basically stopping the interference of floods. However, every year, some farmland was still reduced in yield due to waterlogging and drought.

Last year, after the entire county was communalized, a mass river-networking movement was launched. Starting in December, the county organized a labor force of more than 50,000 people, led by the secretaries of Party committees at all levels, advancing bravely and tenaciously towards nature. After nearly fifty days of effort, the county completed more than 26 million cubic meters of earthwork for river-networking, digging 1,240 large and small ditches, including 18 navigable canals with a total length of 64 kilometers, freeing 150,000 mu of farmland from the threat of drought and flood.

The Guanhuyuan of the Shakou People's Commune, which has 50,000 mu of arable land, used to have only half of its land planted, and even that was not guaranteed to be harvested. After the river-networking was realized, more than 20,000 mu of arable land in the entire Yuan can be irrigated by gravity flow, and another 27,000 mu can basically be exempted from waterlogging and drought disasters. This year, the entire Yuan expanded its rice planting area by more than 17,000 mu. The Tuohuyuan of the Fengfeng People's Commune and the Hengshuyuan of the Caoshi People's Commune were the most afraid of drought. Although this year's drought is severe, these two places do not lack water, the crops are growing well, and the area of rice transplanting has also increased compared to previous years.

Now, the superiority of river-networking has taken root in the hearts of the people in Honghu County, and the local people are determined to realize river-networking in more areas this winter and next spring.

    公社修下河网　水旱灾害低头
    洪湖县十五万亩农田天干不缺水暴雨不成灾
    新华社讯　湖北省洪湖县约有十五万亩农田，今春有两次在连续降雨达一百八十毫米的情况下，没有渍水成灾；6月中旬以来，虽然全县一场透雨未降，但这些农田也不感缺水，有的地区还能保持自流灌溉。另外，还有一部分没有全部实现河网化的农田，由于挖了一些渠道，今年受渍、受旱的程度也比往年大为减轻。这是洪湖县去冬今春兴建河网化水利工程的结果。
    洪湖县位于江汉平原，三面临江，境内大多数地区地势低洼，容易发生涝灾。另一方面，人们因受水灾影响，没有开渠蓄水、引水防旱的习惯。于是，这里许多年都是水大防汛、雨多排渍、天晴抗旱。解放后，中共洪湖县委曾采取一系列的措施，领导全县人民，用几年的时间加固了江汉干堤，新修了洪湖隔堤，基本上制止住了洪水的干扰。但是，每年仍有部分农田因渍水、干旱而减产。
    去年，全县公社化以后，开展了群众性的河网化运动。从12月开始，全县组织了五万多劳动大军，由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，英勇顽强地向大自然进军。经过近五十天的努力，全县完成河网化土方工程二千六百多万公方，开挖大小沟渠一千二百四十条，其中通航渠道十八条，总长六十四公里，使十五万亩农田摆脱了旱涝威胁。
    拥有五万亩耕地的沙口人民公社官湖垸，过去常年只有半数成种，而且还不保收。实现河网化后，全垸有二万多亩耕地能够自流灌溉，另有二万七千多亩也基本上能免除渍、旱灾害，今年全垸就扩大水稻面积一万七千多亩。峰峰人民公社的沱湖垸和曹市人民公社的亨寿垸，是最怕旱的地方，今年虽然干旱严重，但这两个地方都不缺水，作物长得很好，插秧面积也比往年增加。
    现在，河网化的优越性在洪湖县已经深入人心，当地人民决心要在今冬明春使更多地区实现河网化。
