The Suzhou Special District Strives Again for an Autumn Harvest Success
Let Various Crops Be Balanced, Let Various Regions Be Balanced, Agriculture and Sideline Occupations All Balanced

    (Reported by our correspondent Fan Wanjun) This newspaper reports: The Suzhou Special District in Jiangsu Province is extensively and deeply carrying out a socialist competition movement with the content of exceeding contracted output through actual production. This promotes the balanced growth of various crops, the balanced production of various regions, and the balanced development of various projects in agricultural and sideline occupations, striving for another full-scale red harvest in the autumn.
    The Party committees at all levels in the Suzhou Special District, based on the summer harvest, comprehensively summarized the work of the first half of the year, and conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda and education on the current situation for cadres and the masses throughout the district. They put forward resounding battle slogans such as "Classify and establish models, greatly promote classification, exceed the quota of labor, exceed the contracted output through actual production," and "Every team exceeds the contracted output, every mu exceeds the target, strive for a great autumn harvest." Moreover, they mobilized and organized urban residents, government departments, schools, enterprises, and other sectors to vigorously support the over-contracted output movement on the agricultural front from all aspects. From urban to rural areas, from cadres to the masses, a mighty torrent of the over-contracted output movement was formed.
    In the over-contracted output movement, various localities put forward different indicators and competed in groups according to different specific conditions. In the competition, they not only grasped the balance of crop growth, but also the balance between regions and the balance of agricultural and sideline occupation projects.
    In terms of focusing on the balance of crop growth, all counties carried out rice and cotton seedling upgrading campaigns in mid-to-late July. From the county party committee to the production team, organizations for eliminating third-class seedlings were established. On-site meetings were held at all levels to check rice seedlings field by field, determine the type, put forward measures according to categories, and improve labor management, so that production increase measures were implemented to teams, groups, people, and fields respectively, ensuring the implementation of production increase measures. In the rice seedling upgrading campaign, Jiangyin County mobilized 930,000 person-times, focusing on topdressing fertilizer, strengthening irrigation management according to seedling conditions, irrigating deep water to first-class seedlings that had already rounded stems and jointed, and irrigating water neither deep nor shallow to second- and third-class seedlings that were developing. At the same time, diseases and insect pests were completely eliminated. After a week of concentrated efforts, among the 890,000 mu of mid-season rice in the county, the first-class seedlings had risen from 56.6% to 63.3%, the second-class seedlings had dropped from 31.8% to 29.5%, and the third-class seedlings had dropped from 11.6% to 7.2%.
    Focusing on the balance between regions means helping backward regions catch up with advanced ones. Since the beginning of summer, county party committees and commune party committees have comprehensively ranked the backward units in their respective regions, found the reasons for backwardness, and taken different measures to solve problems accordingly. The Kunshan County Party Committee has sent 61 capable cadres to serve as branch secretaries and team leaders in 49 brigades with weak leadership. At the same time, labor cooperation was organized according to the principle of equal value exchange. For example, the Qiandun Commune extracted more than 100 laborers from the Friendship Brigade, which was making rapid progress in weeding, to help the Zhongjie Brigade, which had poor production, to carry out rush weeding of more than 200 mu of late rice, catching up with the production of advanced teams.
    Focusing on the balance of projects means not only seizing the early rice harvest and the mid- and late-stage management of mid- and late-season rice, but also seizing the sowing of late autumn crops, treating late autumn as a season. The district plans to plant 300,000 mu of double-cropping rice, an increase of one and a half times compared to the 110,000 mu actually planted last year, and other late autumn miscellaneous grains have also increased greatly compared to last year. Currently, the experience of early rice bumper harvests is being summarized, late rice is being rushed to be planted, quality is being adhered to, and efforts are being made to exceed the previous season in the latter season. At the same time, not only rice is being grasped, but also cotton and other economic crops, and not only agriculture is being grasped, but also sideline occupations. While leading summer agricultural production, the county party committees have successively convened sideline occupation mobilization meetings, summarized the experiences and lessons of developing sideline occupation production in the first half of the year, and put forward requirements for developing sideline occupation production in the second half of the year. Party committees at all levels have assigned a secretary to lead a group of forces to lead sideline occupation production. Since July, the district has increased the number of pigs and sheep by 55,000 and poultry by 300,000.
    In order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in summer agricultural and sideline occupation production, the leaders at all levels in the Suzhou Special District have made the greatest determination, seized the key opportunity of the three months of July, August, and September, not letting go of every second, and going deep into the masses at all levels, implementing field production and field office work. The Party Committee offices of many communes in Changshu and Wuxian have moved to the production teams, everyone participates in production, problems are discovered, meetings are held in the fields, measures are studied, and immediately implemented. At the same time, county party committees and commune party committees have reduced telephone conferences and held more small-scale, single-item on-site meetings, effectively overcoming the limitations of cadres, broadening their horizons, and promptly promoting advanced experiences, and solving problems on the spot.
    Now the over-contracted output movement in the Suzhou Special District is continuing to deepen, and millions of cadres and masses throughout the district are battling in the fields in the scorching heat, meticulously managing rice and cotton, and not giving an inch. More than 400,000 mu of early rice has begun to be harvested, and more than 2.3 million mu of mid-season rice has undergone one weeding and two topdressings, and is currently growing well, generally rounding stems and jointing, with thick and strong stems. More than 2.5 million mu of late rice has completed one weeding and one plowing and the second topdressing, and is now entering the peak period of tillering. More than 600,000 mu of cotton has completed four cultivations and weeding and two topdressings, and has now generally budded and blossomed. The summer fertilizer accumulation movement is in full swing, and more than 200 million dan of fertilizer has been accumulated in the past month. The first battle to prevent and control diseases and insect pests has ended victoriously, and the second battle focusing on eliminating the third generation of rice borers is being fully launched. Summer sideline occupation production is also developing continuously, and the overall situation in the district is bright and full of hope.

    分类树标兵　落后赶先进　竞赛鼓干劲
    苏州专区再争秋季满堂红
    让各种作物平衡　让各个地区平衡　农业副业都平衡
    本报讯　江苏省苏州专区广泛深入地开展以实产超包产为内容的社会主义竞赛运动，促使各种作物生长平衡、各个地区生产平衡、农业副业中的各个项目发展平衡，力争秋季丰收再来一个满堂红。
    苏州专区各级党委，在夏季丰收的基础上，全面总结了上半年工作，向全区干部群众广泛深入地进行了关于当前形势的宣传教育工作，提出
  “分类树标兵，分类大促进，劳动超定额，实产超包产”“队队超包产，亩亩超指标，争取秋熟大丰收”等响亮的战斗口号。并且动员和组织了城镇居民、机关、学校、企业等部门，从各方面大力支援农业战线上的超包产运动。从城镇到农村，从干部到群众，汇成一股声势浩大的超包产运动的洪流。
    各地在超包产运动中，根据不同的具体条件，提出不同指标，分组竞赛。在竞赛中，既抓作物生长的平衡，又抓地区之间的平衡和农副业项目上的平衡。
    在大抓作物生长平衡的方面，各县都于7月中下旬开展了稻棉苗升级运动。从县委到生产小队都建立了消灭三类苗指挥组织。层层召开现场会议，逐丘查看稻苗，确定类型，分类提出措施，并改进劳动管理，使增产措施分别落实到队、到组、到人、到田，保证增产措施的贯彻执行。江阴县在稻苗升级运动中，出动九十三万人次，以追肥为重点，分别苗情，加强灌溉管理，对已经圆秆拔节的一类苗灌进深水，对正在发棵的二三类苗灌水不深不浅。同时全面消灭病虫害。全县八十九万亩中稻，经过一周突击，一类苗已从56.6％上升到63.3％，二类苗由31.8％下降到29.5％，三类苗由11.6％下降到7.2％。
    大抓地区之间的平衡，就是帮助落后地区赶上先进。入夏以来，各县委、公社党委都对本地区的落后单位进行了全面排队，找到落后原因，采取不同措施对症下药。昆山县委对领导力量薄弱的四十九个大队，已增派六十一个得力干部去担任支部书记和大队长，同时按等价交换的原则，组织劳力协作。如茜墩公社从耘趟进度快的友谊大队抽出一百多个劳动力帮助生产差的忠节大队突击除草，三天内完成二百多亩晚稻耘趟，赶上先进队的生产。
    大抓项目的平衡，就是既抓早稻抢收，中晚稻中后期管理，又抓晚秋作物的播种，把晚秋当一季抓起来。全区计划种双季后作稻三十万亩，比去年实种十一万亩增加一倍半，其他晚秋杂粮也比去年大大增加。当前正总结早稻丰产经验，抢栽晚稻，坚持质量，力争后季超前季。同时，既抓水稻，又抓棉花和其他经济作物，既抓农业，又抓副业。各县委在领导夏季农业生产的同时，都先后召开了副业誓师大会，总结上半年发展副业生产的经验教训，提出下半年发展副业生产的要求。各级党委都分工一个书记带领一帮力量领导副业生产。7月份以来，全区已增养猪羊五万五千头，家禽三十万只。
    为了争取夏季农副业生产全面丰收，苏州专区各级领导下最大决心，狠抓7、8、9三个月关键时机，分秒不让，层层深入群众，实行田头生产，田头办公。常熟、吴县许多公社党委办公室搬到生产小队，人人参加生产，发现问题就在田头开会，研究措施，立即贯彻。同时各县委、公社党委都减少电话会议，多开小型单项现场会议，有效地克服干部的局限性，扩大眼界，及时推广先进经验，发现问题就地解决。
    现在苏州专区超包产运动正在继续深入展开，全区百万干部和群众冒酷暑大战田间，稻棉管理精雕细刻，一着不让。四十多万亩早稻已开镰收割，二百三十多万亩中稻经过一趟二耘和二次追肥，目前长势很好，普遍圆秆拔节，茎秆粗壮。二百五十多万亩晚稻一耘一趟和第二次追肥全面结束，现已进入分蘖盛期。六十多万亩棉花已完成四次中耕锄草和二次追肥，现已普遍现蕾开花。夏季积肥运动声势浩大，一个月来已积肥二亿多担。防治病虫害的第一个战役已胜利结束，以消灭三化螟第三代为重点的第二个战役正在全面展开。夏季副业生产也正在不断发展，全区形势一片光明，充满希望。　（特约通讯员范万钧）
