　　On Reading Methods
　　Wang Weixuan
    Since the advocacy of conscientious reading, many comrades have been diligently reading by squeezing time out of their busy schedules. However, some comrades are troubled by a lack of experience in research. I think that talking about reading methods at this time will be somewhat beneficial to improving reading efficiency.
    Broadly speaking, reading can be divided into two types: skimming and in-depth reading.
    Skimming mainly involves getting an overview of the content. Depending on individual needs, some parts can be read more carefully, while others only require grasping the general idea. Using this method of reading allows us to read faster and free up more time to read other books. Everyone always wants to understand more and use books to gain a deeper and broader understanding of life, expand their horizons, and increase their knowledge. If we only read one type of book, our vision tends to be limited to a narrow scope. In today's era of increasingly developed science, we are required to have broader knowledge. As a state worker, one should understand even more, and should learn some philosophy, political economy, law, history, literature, grammar and rhetoric, logic, natural science, and foreign languages, etc. This is also to broaden everyone's horizons, absorb the essence of human wisdom more deeply and extensively, and make our work better. Lu Xun said in a letter to Yan Limin: "It is not very good to read only one person's works: you will not get many-sided advantages. You must be like a bee, collecting many flowers, so that you can brew honey. If you sting in one place, what you get will be very limited and monotonous." ("Complete Works of Lu Xun," Vol. 10, p. 309) Marx and Engels were the most famous people who read extensively. When Marx was writing "Das Kapital," he consulted more than 1,500 books and made necessary excerpts. Engels also had a wide range of reading, even causing Marx to advise him. Engels not only read works on philosophy, political economy, law, literature, history, and military science, but in the last years of his life, he also read obstetrics books with great interest. (See "Reminiscences of Marx and Engels," p. 94) In 1849, Engels learned a lot about navigation while sailing from Genoa to England, and recorded the position of the sun, wind direction, and tidal changes on the ship. Therefore, it is no wonder that his "Dialectics of Nature" and "Anti-Dühring" and other books almost involve many major issues in natural science and social science. From this, it can be seen that in learning, one must dare to climb rugged roads, and the wider the range of study, the more wisdom we can absorb. Wang Chong said in "Lunheng," "Bietong Pian": "Those who wade in shallow water see shrimp, those who go deeper observe fish and turtles, and those who go even deeper see dragons; the footprints are different, so the things seen are different." (See "Zhu Zi Ji Cheng," Vol. 7, "Lunheng," p. 131) This is also the same principle.
    Some people raise the old saying "opening a book is beneficial." Of course, as long as we use the Marxist viewpoint to look at these books, we can distinguish which are beneficial and which are harmful, and even "poisonous weeds" can be turned into "fertilizer." However, everyone's energy and time are always limited, and we cannot read the countless books that fill the shelves. For the vast number of readers, in order to save time and energy, they should use the shortest time to study more beneficial books. Therefore, there should be a selection in reading. When choosing, attention should be paid to one's own cultural and theoretical level. Now, our book review work is done much better than in the past. We can read the books that we think are most necessary according to the introductions in newspapers and magazines, and read them carefully.
    In-depth reading means clarifying and mastering all the content of the book, so that the knowledge in the book becomes our own knowledge. Some comrades often have the problem of "glancing over" and "not seeking thorough understanding." It is completely inappropriate to treat books for in-depth reading in this way.
    When reading in depth, we can put necessary marks on the book or draw red lines. We can also write our own experiences or opinions on the book's margins. As long as we browse Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks," we can see that Lenin's emotions fluctuated with the thoughts in the book when he was reading philosophical works. Sometimes Lenin was so happy that he wrote as if he had found a treasure: "Yes!" "Well said!" "Attention!" and other words of approval, and sometimes he made sharp criticisms of the arguments in the book. For example, after reading a tedious discussion, he wrote: "These parts of this work should be called: the best way to cause a headache!" (See "Philosophical Notebooks," p. 161) More importantly, he wrote down his own experiences and insights. Through this method, he was able to deepen his knowledge.
    In-depth reading, as the name suggests, should be "few but refined." For example, if we study political economy, we can identify the revised third edition of the "Textbook of Political Economy" compiled by the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a reader. Read it carefully from beginning to end. If there are difficulties, you can find necessary reference books, but prevent the practice of "the guest overwhelming the host."
    When reading in depth, you can also take reading notes or reading excerpts. The writing style of reading notes can be different according to individual needs. You can copy important sentences and paragraphs from the book, or you can write down your own feelings. Reading notes are best written by category, so that they are easy to check. When copying the original text, the book title, author, page number, and publication date should be noted in order to check the original text in the future. Reading notes should be read frequently, so that we can review the old and know the new. Marx had this habit. Every once in a while, he would review his reading notes and the places he had marked in the book. He even carried a notebook with him when he went for a walk, so that he could write down what he saw and heard. Lenin also liked to take reading notes. According to Krupskaya's recollection, "Lenin did not rely on his memory, although his memory was very good. He never narrated facts 'approximately' based on memory. He narrated facts very accurately. He read a lot of material (he read books as fast as he wrote them), and he wrote down notes of what he wanted to remember. There are many excerpts preserved in his notebooks. … He read the things he had recorded repeatedly, which can be seen from the symbols and emphasis marks he had made.” (See “Learning Work Methods from Lenin,” Sanlian Bookstore, 7th edition, April 1950, p. 3) Lenin not only frequently read his own notes, but "he also repeatedly read his own articles, and also added some comments on them. If he encountered a place that aroused some new ideas, he would also make an emphasis mark and note its page number on the cover." (Ibid.) Marx and Lenin's learning methods can give us great inspiration.
    If conditions permit, you can also engage in writing exercises, writing down your own learning experiences. Reading is a kind of learning, and practicing writing is a comprehensive learning. Generally speaking, reading is mostly focused on accepting knowledge, while writing is an active process of understanding and more in-depth thinking, which can help us learn more deeply.
    Whether it is skimming or in-depth reading, we must oppose being slaves to books, and we should use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method to analyze the problems in the book. There are often two different attitudes to reading: one is the attitude of a bookworm, who believes that everything in the book is correct, and does not think for himself, becoming a bookworm who "sticks to the past and does not know how to adapt." There is a story in "Han Feizi" called "Ying Shu Yan Shuo," which is the most typical example. A person in Ying wrote a letter to the prime minister of Yan. In the middle of the night, the candlelight was not bright, so he said to the person standing next to him holding the candlelight: "Hold the candle," but unconsciously wrote the words "Hold the candle" on the letter. After receiving his letter, the prime minister of Yan was very satisfied and said: The words "hold the candle" mean to be bright. If the country wants to be bright, it must employ virtuous people. He came to this conclusion and told his "experience" to the King of Yan. He did not know that the other party wrote the words "hold the candle" completely by mistake. However, this reader came up with various explanations for it, which was actually his own subjective memory. The ancients said: "It is better to have no books than to believe everything in books," which can explain this problem. We should adopt another attitude, which is that reading must be done with the brain, digested. To digest food, you must secrete saliva, gastric juice, bile, intestinal juice, etc., which means you must spend a part of yourself. The same is true for reading. Books are just external spiritual food. If we want to truly digest this spiritual food, we should also pay our mental labor, put forward our own ideas and opinions, and re-explore and criticize the knowledge in the book. Only in this way can we gain something, can we more deeply understand the content of the book, and make it our own nutrition. To achieve this goal, when reading, we cannot be completely limited to what is written on the surface, but more importantly, we should understand the spiritual essence of the book. Only in this way can we truly grasp the author's main ideas. Su Dongpo wrote in a satirical poem to his younger brother Su Zhe: "Who knows the meaning of the sage, not all in the books. The melody is still there when the song is finished, and the machine is empty when the instrument is finished." (See "Selected Poems of Su Shi," p. 52, People's Literature Publishing House) This means that we should understand the spiritual essence of the books, and not just circle around individual words and sentences. It is like listening to a performance, we want to appreciate the music, not to look at the strings that make the sound. If we only entangle ourselves in individual words and sentences, and do not understand the spiritual essence of the author, it is as ridiculous as not appreciating the wonderful music but looking at the unchanging strings! Some comrades say: "Books should be read thinner and thinner, not thicker and thicker." The meaning of this sentence is precisely that the content of the book should be turned into knowledge that you have mastered after your own digestion. Only when you have mastered the content of the whole book, and you can close the book and describe the central idea of the book in your own words, only after it becomes your own fully mastered knowledge, can you truly understand it thoroughly and draw inferences from one example.
    The purpose of our reading is to enrich our knowledge and make this knowledge serve our socialist construction cause. Therefore, we should apply the knowledge we have learned from books to practical work and life in the spirit of learning for application. Marx was a person who regarded books as a tool for mental labor. He said to people: "They (referring to books) are my slaves and must obey my will." (See "Marx and Engels on Education," p. 362) Today, we should also appear as masters and become the masters of books, and we should not be reduced to slaves of books. This is the most important issue in reading methods.

　　谈谈读书方法
　　王威宣
    自从提倡认真读书以来，许多同志都在百忙中挤时间勤奋读书。但是，也有一些同志苦于缺乏钻研的经验。我想，这时候来谈谈读书方法，对于提高读书的效率，是会有一点好处的。
    粗略地说来，读书可分为略读和精读两种。
    略读，主要是涉猎其内容，根据各人的需要，有的地方可以读得仔细一些，有的地方只领会个大意。用这种办法读书，可以使我们看得更快些，使我们腾出较多的时间来阅读其他的书籍。每一个人总是愿意使自己懂得多一点，通过书本，使我们更深刻地、更广泛地认识生活，扩大视野，增长知识。如果我们只看一类书籍，往往使我们的眼界只局限于一个狭小的范围。在今天，科学日益发达的时代，要求我们有更广博的知识。作为一个国家工作人员，还应该懂得更多一点，应该学点哲学、政治经济学、法学、历史学、文学、语法修辞、逻辑、自然科学和外国语等等。这也就是扩大每个人的眼界，更深刻地更广泛地吸取人类智慧的结晶，使我们的工作做得更好。鲁迅先生在给颜黎民的信中便说：“只看一个人的著作，结果是不大好的：你就得不到多方面的优点。必须如蜜蜂一样，采过许多花，这才能酿出蜜来，倘若叮在一处，所得就非常有限，枯燥了。”（“鲁迅全集”，第10卷，309页）马克思和恩格斯便是博览群书的最有名的人。马克思在著作“资本论”的时候，先后参考了一千五百多种书籍，并且都做了必要的摘录。恩格斯阅读范围也很广泛，甚至引起了马克思对他提出劝告。恩格斯不仅阅读哲学、政治经济学、法学、文学、历史、军事学等方面的著作，在他一生的最后几年，连产科的书籍也津津有味地细读起来。（见“回忆马克思恩格斯”，94页）1849年，恩格斯乘帆船从热那亚到英国的途中，还学习了不少航海知识，并在船上记录太阳的位置、风向、海潮的变化等等。所以，怪不得在他的“自然辩证法”和“反杜林论”等书中，几乎牵涉到自然科学和社会科学中的许多重大问题。由此可见，在学习上必须敢于攀登崎岖的道路，涉猎越广，才能使我们吸收更多的智慧。王充在“论衡”“别通篇”中说：“涉浅水者见虾，其颇深者察鱼鳖，其尤甚者观蛟龙；足行迹殊，故所见之物异也。”（见“诸子集成”第七卷，“论衡”，131页）也是这个道理。
    有人提出“开卷有益”的老话来。当然，只要我们运用马克思主义的观点来看这些书籍，就可能辨别哪些是有益的，哪些是有害的，甚至“毒草”也可以化为“肥料”。但是，每个人的精力和时间总是有限的，我们不可能阅读汗牛充栋、浩如烟海的书籍。对于广大的读者来说，为了节省时间和精力，应该利用最短的时间学习更有益处的书籍。因此，在阅读中便应该有所选择。选择时应注意自己的文化水平和理论水平。现在，我们的书刊评介工作比过去做得好多了，可以根据报刊的介绍，阅读自己认为最必需的书籍，并仔细精读。
    精读，就是要把书上的内容全部弄清楚，并加以掌握，使书本的知识变为我们自己的知识。有些同志往往有“一目十行”、“不求甚解”的毛病。用这种办法来对待精读的书籍是完全不适当的。
    精读时，我们可以在书上注上必要的记号，或划上红线。也可以在书眉上注上我们自己的心得或意见。只要我们翻阅列宁的“哲学笔记”，便可以看出列宁在阅读哲学著作时的感情是随着书中的思想而起伏的。有时列宁高兴得如获至宝似的写上：“对！”“说得好！”“注意！”等等赞同的字眼，有时则对书中的论述提出尖锐的批评。例如看了烦琐的论述便写道：“这部著作的这些部分应当叫做：引起头痛的最好办法！”（见“哲学笔记”，第161页）他更主要的是把自己的心得和见解记上去，通过这种方式，便能深化所学的知识。
    精读，顾名思义就是要“少而精”。例如，我们学习政治经济学，就可以认定苏联科学院经济研究所编的“政治经济学教科书”修订第三版为读本。从头至尾地细读，遇有困难固然可以找必要的参考书籍，但要防止“喧宾夺主”的做法。
    精读时还可以作读书笔记或读书摘记。读书笔记的写法可以根据各人的需要而有不同。可以抄录书上的重要句子、段落，也可以把自己的感受写上去。读书笔记最好分类来写，这样便于查对。在抄录原文时，应把书名、作者、页数、出版年月记下来，以便将来查对原文。读书笔记应当经常翻阅，这样可以温故而知新。马克思就有这种习惯，每隔一些时日就要重温他的读书笔记和书中做了记号的地方，甚至在散步的时候也带着笔记本，以便把所见所闻记上去。列宁也是喜欢作读书笔记的。根据克鲁普斯卡娅的回忆，“列宁并不靠自己的记忆，虽然他的记忆是很好的。他从不凭记忆‘大致不差地’来叙述事实，他叙述事实是极确切的。他阅读了极多的材料（他读书，也像他写作一样，都是很快的），想要记着的地方，他都写上了笔记。在他的笔记簿上保存有很多的摘录。……所记录的东西，后来他都反复地阅读过，这从他所标记的那些符号和着重号等等中可以看得出来。”（见“向列宁学习工作方法”，三联书店，1950年4月第七版，第三页）列宁不仅经常阅读自己的笔记，“他也反复地阅读自己的文章，也在它上面加些评注，如遇到有引起什么新思想的地方，他也打出着重号来，并在封面上记下其页数。”（同上）马克思和列宁的这种学习方法，可以给我们极大的启发。
    如果有条件，也可以从事写作练习。把自己学习的心得写出来。读书是一种学习，练习写作更是一种综合性的学习。一般说来，看书多半是偏重于接受知识，而写作便是积极地理解和更深入的思考过程，可以帮助我们学习得更加深入。
    不论略读或精读，必须反对做书本的奴隶，应当用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法来分析书中的问题。读书往往有两种不同的态度：一种是书呆子的态度，认为书本上的东西都是对的，自己不加思考，变成一个“食古不化”的蛀书虫了。“韩非子”中有一则“郢书燕说”的故事，便是最典型的例子。郢地有一个人写信给燕国的宰相，写到半夜，烛光不亮，他便对站在旁边拿着烛光的人说：“举烛”，而自己不知不觉地却在信上写上“举烛”两字。燕国宰相接到他的信后，非常满意地说：“举烛”两字是说要光明的意思，国家要得到光明，必须任用贤能的人。他做了这个结论，并且把自己的“心得”告诉了燕王。殊不知对方写“举烛”两字，完全是写错了的。但是这个读者，却替它想了种种解释，实际上是自己主观的忆测而已。古人云：“尽信书不如无书”，正可以说明这个问题。我们应该采用另一种态度，那便是读书必须用脑筋思考，加以消化。消化食物必须分泌唾液、胃液、胆汁、肠液等等，这就是说必须支出自己的一部分东西。读书的道理也是一样。书本只是外来的精神粮食，我们要真正消化这些精神粮食，也应该付出自己的脑力劳动，拿出自己的主张和看法，把书本知识重新探讨过、批判过。这样才能有所收获，才能更深入地理解书本的内容，使它成为自己的营养。要达到这个目的，我们读书时就不能完全局限于字面上所写的东西，更主要的应该是领会书中的精神实质。这样才能真正把握住作者的主要思想。苏东坡在写给他的弟弟苏辙的一首讽刺诗中写道：“谁知圣人意，不尽书籍中。曲尽弦犹在，器成机见空。”（见“苏轼诗选”，52页，人民文学出版社）这个意思也就是要领会书籍的精神实质，不能只在个别字句里去兜圈子。正好比听演奏我们要欣赏的是音乐，而不是去看发出声响的琴弦。如果我们只纠缠在个别的字句里，没有领会作者的精神实质，那正好像不欣赏美妙的音乐而去看那没有变化的琴弦一样可笑了！有些同志说：“书本应该越读越薄，而不是越读越厚”。这句话的意思也正是应该经过自己的消化，把书本中的内容变为自己掌握的知识。只有自己掌握了全书的内容，把书本闭起来，也可以把书本的中心思想用自己的话叙述出来，只有变成自己的完全掌握的知识之后，才能真正融会贯通，举一反三。
    我们读书的目的是丰富我们的知识，并使这些知识为我们的社会主义建设事业服务。所以，应该本着学以致用的精神把书本上所学到的知识运用到实际工作和生活中去。马克思便是把书本当成脑力劳动的工具的人，他对人说：“它们（指书籍）是我的奴隶，一定要服从我的意旨”。（见“马克思恩格斯论教育”，362页）今天我们也应该以主人翁的姿态出现，成为书本的主人，而不应该沦为书本的奴仆。这是读书方法中最重要的问题。
