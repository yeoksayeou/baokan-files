Editorial: Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Rice in the North

Good news of early rice harvests from the southern regions are constantly pouring in; the middle rice is growing very well, and a bumper harvest is highly promising; the late rice transplanting is proceeding quickly and well, and many places have paid attention to strengthening early management, all of which are conducive to the continued leap forward in rice production this year. However, to achieve an all-round bumper harvest of rice, not only must early, middle, and late rice all leap forward, but the northern and southern rice-growing areas must also compete for high yields and bumper harvests together. Although the proportion of northern rice in grain production is not as large as that of the southern rice areas, its output is extremely considerable and is an important part of national rice production. The success or failure of the northern rice harvest will directly affect the total rice output. This year, although the rice planting area in the north only accounts for 7% of the national rice area, according to the situation in previous years, its total output often accounts for about 14% of the total national grain output. In 1957, the average rice planting area in the five provinces of Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning accounted for 5% of the sown area of grain crops in each province, but the total output of rice accounted for 10% of the total grain output. From a national perspective, the northern rice-growing areas are relatively dispersed, but in some areas, they are relatively concentrated. For example, rice planting is relatively concentrated in the lower reaches of the Hai River in Hebei, the banks of the Liao River and Songhua River in Northeast China, the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia, and the Yinchuan irrigation area of Ningxia. These concentrated production areas are mostly important bases for commodity grain, and increasing rice production directly increases the supply of commodity grain. Making every effort to increase rice production in the north can also change the low-yield situation in areas north of the Huai River. In May of last year, this newspaper also published an editorial, discussing that expanding rice planting in the north is a strategic measure to change the low-yield situation in areas north of the Huai River. Most of the land in the north is fertile, and as long as rice can be replanted, the yield per unit area can be increased many times, and the unit yield in some areas will be higher than that in the south of the Yangtze River. The emergence of many high-yield rice fields in the north last year is an example. Therefore, further increasing rice production in the north is of great significance.

Can rice production in the north continue to leap forward together with the southern rice areas? It is entirely possible. This is not only because most of the land in the north is fertile, but also because the climate conditions in the north are also suitable for rice growth: rainfall is mostly concentrated in July, August, and September, which is the period when rice needs the most water; the temperature is higher from May to September, which can meet the growth requirements of rice; in addition, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the sunshine hours are long, which is conducive to the accumulation of nutrients in rice. The northern rice areas also have experience in striving for high yields. For example, the rice yield in the suburbs of Tianjin and the Yanbian area of Jilin was relatively high in the past, and the cultivation technology was also relatively advanced. In the great leap forward in agricultural production last year, many regions created high-yield experiences with yields of more than a thousand catties per mu. This year, the northern rice areas have been relatively timely in raising seedlings and transplanting, and early management has generally been grasped tightly. As long as we boost our energy, oppose slackness, and make full use of the favorable climatic conditions, rich technical experience, and existing cultivation and management foundation, and make persistent efforts in the next two months to do a good job in late field management, the northern rice will surely have a bumper harvest.

The northern rice area is relatively broad and the temperature conditions are different. Therefore, some rice is in the early stage of panicle differentiation, and some rice is in the late stage of panicle differentiation, but in general, they are all in the panicle differentiation stage. This stage is a critical period for determining the size of the panicle and the fullness of the grains. In field management, we must seize the measures of topdressing, irrigation, and weeding to promote the growth and development of rice seedlings. In terms of topdressing, we must not only look at the fields and the seedlings, but also look at the previous fertilization situation, and implement key supplementary fertilization, applying fertilizer to the fields that need fertilizer and the seedlings that lack fertilizer, so as to use less fertilizer and achieve greater results. Rice grows rapidly during panicle differentiation, and the need for water is the most urgent, and the fields should not be short of water. However, too deep a water layer is also not conducive to the growth of seedlings, especially during this period when there is more rain, we must pay attention to frequently checking the water and draining the water to maintain a certain water layer in the rice fields. For rice fields with poor water conservancy facilities, we must pay attention to storing water during rain. In some rice areas where the water source is insufficient and drought occurs, we should make every effort to open up water sources, save water, and ensure that the panicles of the seedlings grow and are not harmed by drought. Rice lodging has a great impact on yield. Lodging not only occurs more frequently in the indica rice areas in the south, but also occurs in the japonica rice areas in the north. According to surveys and test results in various places, it has been proved that the lodged seedlings generally show weakness in the base of the stems. This phenomenon, in addition to being related to excessive dense planting in some cases, is mainly caused by excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer and excessive irrigation. Therefore, reasonable fertilization, shallow and frequent irrigation, and timely drying of fields must be implemented for high-yield fields with more fertilizer and dense planting.

Rice diseases and insect pests are very harmful to the northern rice area. At present, rice stem borers, rice leaf rollers, rice planthoppers, armyworms and rice blast have occurred in different regions. All localities must strengthen inspections, promptly organize the masses to seriously eliminate and control them, and protect the normal growth of rice seedlings.

In order to make field management timely, meticulous and thorough, first of all, the county-level and commune-level leading organs in the northern rice-producing areas are required to fully recognize the great significance of striving for a bumper harvest of rice in the north for the overall leap forward in grain crop production; at the same time, they must also recognize that the current time is a great opportunity to strengthen field management, educate the broad masses of grassroots cadres and the masses to generally recognize the importance of current field management, fully mobilize the positive factors of all parties, and the upper and lower levels are full of confidence and energetic in carrying out rice field management. Leading cadres should go deep into the fields to study management measures with the masses and summarize experiences and lessons in a timely manner. After gaining practical experience, it should be immediately and comprehensively promoted. The timing is very valuable, and the leading organs at all levels in the northern regions must use a certain amount of strength to lead the broad masses and strive to achieve a bumper harvest of rice.

### 争取北方水稻大丰收

　　争取北方水稻大丰收
    目前南方地区早稻丰收的好消息正在不断传来；中稻生长非常良好，丰收大有希望；晚稻栽插又快又好，许多地方注意了加强早期管理，这些都有利于今年水稻生产继续向前跃进。但是要实现水稻全面丰收，不仅早稻、中稻、晚稻要全面跃进，而且还要求北方稻区和南方稻区一齐争高产夺丰收。目前北方水稻在粮食生产方面的比重虽然不及南方稻区大，但是产量是极为可观的，是全国水稻生产的重要组成部分之一。北方水稻收成的丰歉将对水稻总产量发生直接影响。今年北方水稻栽插面积虽然只占全国水稻面积7％，但是，按往年的情况来估计，它的总产量却往往占全国粮食总产量的14％左右。1957年河北、河南、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁五个省的水稻栽插面积平均占各该省的粮食作物播种面积5％，但是水稻的总产量却占粮食总产量的10％。北方稻区从全国总的范围来看，是比较分散的，就某些地区来说，却又是比较集中的。例如河北的海河下游、东北辽河和松花江的沿岸、内蒙古的河套、宁夏的银川灌区，水稻栽插都比较集中，这些集中产区大多又是商品粮的重要基地，增产稻谷就直接增加了商品粮的供应量。多方设法提高北方水稻产量，还可以改变淮河以北地区的低产面貌。去年5月本报也曾发表过一篇社论，谈在北方扩种水稻是改变淮河以北地区低产面貌的一项具有战略意义的措施。北方大部分地区土地肥沃，只要能改种水稻，单位面积产量就可以成倍地提高，有些地区的单位产量还会比江南的高。去年北方出现许多水稻高产田，就是例证。因此，进一步提高北方水稻生产具有十分重要的意义。
    北方水稻生产能不能随同南方稻区共同继续跃进呢？完全可能。这不仅因为北方地区大部土地肥沃，而且还因为北方气候条件也适合水稻生长：雨水多集中在7、8、9三个月，正当水稻需水最多的时期；在5月到9月气温较高，能够适应水稻生育要求；加以昼夜温差较大，日照时间较长，利于水稻积累养料。北方稻区也有争取高产的经验。例如天津郊区和吉林延边地区过去水稻产量都较高，栽培技术也比较先进。在去年农业生产大跃进中，更有不少地区创造了亩产千斤以上的丰产经验。今年北方稻区育秧、栽插都比较及时，早期管理一般也抓得较紧。只要鼓足干劲，反对松劲，充分运用有利的气候条件，丰富的技术经验和既有的栽培管理基础，在今后的两个月里再接再厉，把后期田间管理认真搞好，北方水稻一定能够大丰收。
    北方稻区范围比较广阔，气温条件不同，因此，有的水稻正处于孕穗前期，有的水稻正处于孕穗后期，但是总的来说都正处于孕穗阶段。这个阶段正是决定穗型大小和籽粒充实与否的关键时期，在田间管理上，必须抓紧追肥、灌溉和除草等措施，促进禾苗的生长发育。在追肥方面，既要看田看禾，还要看前期施肥情况，实行重点补肥，把肥料用在需肥的田块和缺肥的禾苗上，作到用肥少、收效大。水稻在孕穗期间生长迅速，需水最为迫切，田间不宜断水。但是水层过深对于禾苗生长也不利，特别在这个期间雨水较多，要注意勤看水、勤排水，使稻田保持一定水层。对水利设施较差的稻田，要注意趁雨蓄水。水源不足、发生旱象的部分稻区，则应尽一切努力开辟水源，节约用水，保证禾苗穗胎成长，不受旱害。水稻倒伏，对产量影响很大。倒伏情况不仅在南方籼稻地区较多出现，在北方粳稻地区同样也发生过。根据各地调查和试验结果证明：倒伏的禾苗一般表现茎秆基部软弱。这种现象除在某种情况下与过分密植有一定关系外，主要原因是追施氮肥过多和灌水过深。因此，对多肥密植的丰产田一定要实行合理施肥和浅水勤灌、适期晒田等管理措施。
    水稻病虫害对北方稻区的危害很大，目前二化螟、稻苞虫、稻飞虱、粘虫及稻瘟病等已经在不同地区陆续发生。各地必须加强检查，及时组织群众认真除治，保护禾苗正常生长。
    为了把田间管理做得及时、细致而又彻底，首先要求北方水稻产区县级和公社级领导机关充分认识争取北方水稻丰收对粮食作物生产全面跃进的重大意义；同时还要认清目前正是加强田间管理的大好时机，教育广大基层干部和群众普遍认识目前田间管理的重要性，把各方面的积极因素充分调动起来，上上下下满怀信心地干劲十足地大搞水稻田间管理工作。领导干部应当深入田间，与群众共同研究管理措施，及时总结经验教训。在取得实际经验后，要立即全面推广。时机非常可贵，北方地区的各级领导机关必须以一定的力量来领导广大群众，为实现水稻丰收而奋斗。
