Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 2nd. According to Indian newspapers on August 1st, the Secretariat of the Indian Communist Party issued a statement on July 31st, calling on members to organize "peaceful protest actions" across the country on August 3rd to oppose the "dissolution of the Kerala state government and attacks on the parliamentary system and democracy." The statement called on all patriotic democrats, regardless of party affiliation, to join the Communist Party in this action.

According to the Press Trust of India, trade union leader Dange said in Mumbai on July 31st that the central government's action was "a serious blow to the development of Indian constitutional democracy." Gopalan, deputy leader of the Communist Party parliamentary group in the Indian People's Assembly, told the press, "This is a very bad precedent. History will never forget this."

Some Indian newspapers have also published editorials criticizing the central government's interference in the Kerala state government. "The United Press" said on August 1st, "It is difficult to agree that the Indian government's decision on the Kerala issue is correct," and "the government's statement that the Kerala state government was not changed based on instigation of movements is wrong." The newspaper asked, "If the current situation in Kerala is not caused by instigation of movements, then what is it caused by?"

The latest issue of "Commerce and Industry" weekly commented that the Indian President's takeover of the Kerala state government was to restore the Congress Party's position in the state. The Congress Party's previous mismanagement and other worse actions in the state have left it in a desperate minority position.

The latest issue of "Lightning" weekly commented in a telegram, "Since the promulgation of the Republic Constitution, this is the first time a state government has been dissolved while still enjoying a majority in the state legislative assembly. In this way, the central government has proved that the constitution can be desecrated to suit the requirements of the Congress Party."

The latest issue of "Delhi Times" weekly commented in the "Capital Log" column, "It is inevitable to give the impression that the Congress Party headquarters has been defeated in Kerala," "It is regrettable that the Congress Party headquarters had to willingly participate in this disgusting and undemocratic practice to drive out the (Kerala state) government."

Today's "Statesman" reported that about eight thousand textile factory and machine manufacturing factory workers went on a partial strike in Delhi yesterday to protest the central government's interference in Kerala. Several workers also held several protest rallies in the old district of Delhi.

According to the Indian News Agency, more than 100,000 students in Calcutta went on strike yesterday to protest the central government's interference in Kerala. After the strike, several demonstration teams held rallies on the lawns of the university and passed resolutions condemning the President's takeover of Kerala.

The Indian News Agency also reported that in Hyderabad, ninety-four members of parliament and non-partisans belonging to the Communist Party, Social Democratic Party and Socialist Party withdrew from the Andhra Pradesh parliament on Saturday to protest the forced implementation of presidential rule in Kerala. The City Federation of Trade Unions also held demonstrations on the 30th and 31st. During the recent "Kerala Week" in this state, twenty-five cities held strikes, eighty thousand workers went on strike in thirty centers, three hundred public rallies were held, and one hundred and thirty township councils passed resolutions opposing central interference. The news said that three hundred city councilors and eight hundred lawyers also opposed the central government's interference.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 2nd. Gopalan, deputy leader of the Communist Party parliamentary group in India, issued a statement today, demanding an immediate halt to the attacks on Kerala communists by opposition parties and sectarian forces. The statement said, "I myself and our party's General Secretary Ghosh have written to the Prime Minister about this matter, and he has promised to investigate the matter. He said he has asked the (Kerala) Governor to take strong action, but this phenomenon continues to occur."

The statement pointed out the number of attacks suffered by Kerala communists after the central government's interference. The statement pointed out, "People cannot expect peace from the leaders of the 'Kerala Liberation Struggle Committee', because they say that when the ministers leave office, their noses should be cut off; they should be publicly whipped."

Conflicts have occurred in Kerala in the past few days. According to Press Trust of India, one person was killed and fourteen were injured in a conflict between the opposition and communists near Trichur yesterday. Conflicts also occurred elsewhere.

The same news agency reported from Trivandrum that Padmanabhan, leader of the "Kerala Liberation Struggle Committee," submitted fifteen demands to the Kerala Governor yesterday, including: stop the implementation of the Education Act, and immediately establish a committee with great power to investigate the Kerala Congress Party's accusations against the Communist government.

"Indian Express" reported that Mrs. Gandhi hinted at a meeting of Congress Party members of parliament yesterday that the future central parliamentary group may consider establishing an election alliance between the Kerala Congress Party, the Muslim League, the Nair Service Society and other forces.

    印公众抗议中央接管喀拉拉邦
    印共号召今天在全国组织抗议行动
    高普兰要求制止对共产党人的袭击
    新华社新德里2日电　据印度报纸1日报道，印度共产党书记处在7月31日发表声明，号召党员8月3日在全国各地组织“和平抗议行动”，反对“解散喀拉拉邦政府和进攻议会制度和民主”。声明要求所有爱国民主人士，不分党派关系，同共产党一起参加这一行动。
    据印度报业托辣斯消息，工会领袖丹吉7月31日在孟买发表谈话说，中央的行动“是对印度宪法民主的发展的一个严重打击”。印度人民院共产党议会党团副领袖高普兰对报界说，“这是一个很坏的先例。历史永远不会忘记这件事。”
    印度一些报纸也发表社论，批评中央政府对喀拉拉邦政府的干涉。“团结报”1日说，“人们很难同意，印度政府在喀拉拉邦问题上所作的决定是正确的”，“政府说，并不是根据煽动运动来更动喀拉拉邦政府的，这种说法是错误的。”这家报纸问道，“如果喀拉拉邦目前的情况不是由煽动运动造成的，那么又是什么造成的呢？”
    最近一期的“工商业”周刊评论说，印度总统接管喀拉拉邦政府是为了挽回国大党在这个邦里的地位。国大党以前在这个邦里管理不当和做了其他更坏的事情，使它处于绝望的少数派地位。
    最近一期的“闪电”周报在一篇电讯中评论说，“自共和国宪法颁布以来，一个邦政府在邦立法会议中仍然享有多数的时候就被解散，这还是第一次，这样，中央就证明了：为了适合国大党的要求，宪法是可以亵渎的”。
    最近一期“德里时代”周报在“首都日志”一栏中评论说，“难免给人这样一种印象：国大党总部在喀拉拉邦遭到了失败”，“遗憾的是，国大党总部竟不得不甘心参与这种令人厌恶的和不民主的做法来赶走（喀拉拉邦）政府”。
    今天的“政治家报”报道，大约八千名纺织工厂和机械制造工厂工人昨天在德里进行了局部的罢工，以抗议中央对喀拉拉邦的干涉。若干工人在德里旧区也举行了好几次抗议集会。
    据印度新闻社报道，昨天加尔各答有十万多学生罢课，抗议中央对喀拉拉邦的干涉。在罢课后，若干示威队伍在大学的草坪上举行集会，并通过了谴责总统接管喀拉拉邦的决议。
    印度新闻社还报道说，在海得拉巴，九十四位属于共产党、社会民主党和社会党的议员和无党派人士星期六退出安得拉邦议会，抗议在喀拉拉邦强制实行总统管理。市工会理事会也在30日和31日举行示威。这个邦最近举行“喀拉拉邦周”时，有二十五个城市举行了罢市，八万名工人在三十个中心举行罢工，举行了三百个公众集会，一百三十个乡评议会通过决议，反对中央干涉。消息说，三百名市议员和八百名律师也反对中央的干涉。
    据新华社新德里2日电　印度共产党议会党团副领袖高普兰今天发表声明，要求立即制止反对党和教派势力对喀拉拉邦共产党人的袭击。声明说，“我本人和我党总书记高士已就这件事写信给总理，他已答应调查这个问题。他说，他已请（喀拉拉）邦长采取有力行动，但是这种现象仍在继续发生。”
    声明指出了在中央进行干涉后，喀拉拉邦共产党人所受到的袭击的次数。声明指出，“人们不能指望从‘喀拉拉邦解放斗争委员会’的领袖们那里得到和平，因为他们说，当部长们离职后，应当割掉他们的鼻子；应当公开鞭打他们。”
    喀拉拉邦在过去几天内发生了冲突。据印度报业托辣斯报道，昨天在特里丘尔附近发生的反对派同共产党人之间的冲突中，有一人被打死，有十四人受伤。别的地方也发生了冲突。
    同一家通讯社从特里凡得琅报道，“喀拉拉邦解放斗争委员会”领袖帕德马纳班昨天向喀拉拉邦长提出十五点要求，其中包括：停止执行教育法，立即成立一个有大权的委员会调查喀拉拉邦国大党对共产党政府提出的指责。
      “印度快报”报道，甘地夫人昨天在国大党议员举行的一个会议上暗示，未来的中央议会党团可能考虑建立喀拉拉邦国大党、穆斯林联盟、奈尔服务社和其他势力之间的选举联盟。
