Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, August 13th: Representatives from major electric furnace steel plants across the country convened an inter-factory mutual assistance and cooperation competition meeting in Benxi City in early August. They summarized and exchanged experiences from the inter-factory mutual assistance competitions conducted by electric furnace steel plants in Northeast China over the past few years. Representatives from various regions unanimously agreed to expand the inter-factory competition based on mutual assistance from electric furnace steel plants in Northeast China to all electric furnace steel plants nationwide, starting now, to initiate a new high tide of increased production and savings, ensuring the realization of this year's leap forward plan for electric furnace steel plants.

The inter-factory competition between electric furnace steel plants in Northeast China began in 1956. They developed from material exchange to a comprehensive exchange of advanced technical experience; from organizing competitions among several electric furnaces with similar capabilities to conducting competitions among all electric furnaces, rolling mills, forging hammers, and other specialized trades with similar equipment; and finally, they formed a relatively sound technical mutual assistance and cooperation network, thereby powerfully promoting production and the common improvement of the technical level of each plant. Over the past three years, these electric furnace steel plants have consistently adhered to the inter-factory competition system, signing six contracts and conducting seven evaluations. Focusing on improving product output and quality, increasing variety, reducing raw material consumption, improving equipment efficiency, and improving enterprise leadership methods, they have mutually exchanged more than a thousand advanced experiences. In the competition, they not only concentrated technical forces to solve common production key problems in each plant through professional meetings and on-site meetings, but also frequently sent people to each other to learn and provide guidance, jointly overcoming difficulties in progress.

The inter-factory competition of electric furnace steel plants in Northeast China has a mass foundation of intra-factory competition and an ideological foundation of cooperation and mutual assistance, and thus has been continuously developed and improved, powerfully promoting the continuous leap forward of various economic indicators of each plant. For example, the utilization coefficient of electric furnaces in Dalian Steel Plant was only 19.204 in 1956, increased to 22.652 in 1957, and soared to 30.044 in 1958, while in the first half of this year, it increased by another 12.133 compared with the same period last year.

The representatives attending the meeting gave a high evaluation of the inter-factory friendship competition of electric furnace steel plants in Northeast China, unanimously believing that this competition fully conforms to the socialist competition principle of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from strengths, and overcoming weaknesses, and making common progress," and is a concrete manifestation of the communist style, setting an example for electric furnace steel plants across the country.

The meeting held that inter-factory competition is also a good organizational form for mutual assistance and cooperation between enterprises in terms of production technology and enterprise management; and regular inspection and evaluation is a powerful weapon to promote the regularization of cooperation and competition.

At the meeting, various plants widely exchanged their advanced experiences since the first half of this year, and actively proposed "treasure offering projects" to assist fraternal plants in strengthening weak links and topics requiring assistance from fraternal plants. Subsequently, the conference organized various steel plants to discuss and negotiate according to different specialties such as smelting, rolling, and forging, and finally decided to incorporate common cooperation projects and single projects between plants into the inter-factory competition conditions. These mutual assistance and cooperation projects, according to the complexity and scope, were determined to be solved by convening professional meetings, sending people for guidance, supporting equipment and providing information, and so on.

Electric furnace steel plants in Dalian, Benxi, Daye, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and other places formally signed inter-factory competition and mutual assistance cooperation contracts at the meeting.

Finally, the meeting also discussed various systems for the organization and leadership, inspection, reward, and evaluation of inter-factory competition.

　　主要电炉钢厂签订厂际竞赛合同
　　互助协作多炼优质钢
    新华社本溪13日电　全国主要电炉钢厂代表8月上旬在本溪市召开厂际互助协作竞赛会议，总结交流了东北地区电炉钢厂几年来开展厂际互助竞赛的经验。各地代表一致同意，从现在起，把东北各电炉钢厂以互助协作为基础的厂际竞赛，扩展到全国各电炉钢厂，以掀起一个增产节约的新高潮，确保今年电炉钢厂跃进计划的实现。
    东北电炉钢厂之间的厂际竞赛是从1956年开始的。他们之间从物资交换发展到全面交流先进技术经验；从组织几个能力相同的电炉开展同设备竞赛，发展到所有的电炉、轧钢机、锻锤等专业的同工种同设备竞赛；最后，更形成了一个比较健全的技术互助协作网，从而有力地推动了生产和各厂技术水平的共同提高。三年来，这些电炉钢厂始终坚持互助竞赛的制度，先后签订了六次合同，进行了七次评比。围绕着提高产品产量、质量，增加品种，降低原材料消耗，提高设备效率，改进企业领导方法等方面，他们相互交流了一千多项先进经验。在竞赛中，他们不仅通过专业会议、现场会议，集中技术力量解决各厂共同性的生产关键问题，而且经常互相派人学习和指导，共同克服前进中的困难。
    东北各电炉钢厂的厂际竞赛，有着厂内竞赛的群众基础和协作互助的思想基础，因而得到不断发展和提高，有力地促进了各厂各项经济指标的不断跃进。如大连钢厂电炉利用系数，1956年只有一九点二零四，1957年提高到二二点六五二，1958年猛增到三零点零四四，而今年上半年又比去年同期提高了一二点一三三。
    参加会议的代表，给东北电炉钢厂的厂际友谊竞赛作了很高的评价，一致认为这一竞赛完全符合“互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高”的社会主义竞赛原则，是共产主义风格的具体表现，为全国电炉钢厂树立了榜样。
    会议认为，厂际竞赛也是企业之间，在生产技术、企业管理方面进行互助协作的较好的组织形式；而定期的检查评比，更是促使协作竞赛经常化的有力武器。
    会上，各厂广泛交流了今年上半年以来的各项先进经验，主动地提出了协助兄弟厂加强薄弱环节的“献宝项目”和要求兄弟工厂帮助的题目。接着，大会就组织各钢厂分炼、轧、锻等不同专业讨论和协商，最后确定将共同性的协作项目和厂与厂之间的单项目，纳入厂际竞赛条件之内。这些互助协作项目，根据复杂的程度和范围的大小，确定有的召开专业会议解决，有的派人指导，有的支援设备和供给资料等等。
    大连、本溪、大冶、重庆、上海、北京等地的电炉钢厂，在会上正式签订了厂际竞赛互助协作合同。
    会议最后还讨论了厂际竞赛的组织领导和检查、奖励、评比等各项制度。
