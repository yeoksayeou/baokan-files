Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th. According to a Vietnam News Agency report today, Phaydang Lobliayao, Vice-Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Patriotic Front Party, wrote again on August 9 to Lieutenant General Bal, Chairman of the International Commission in Laos, accusing the United States and the Lao Sananikone authorities of continuing to push the situation in Laos towards a more serious state, and reiterated the Lao Patriotic Front Party's position on the current situation in Laos.

The letter solemnly pointed out that the United States and the Sananikone authorities are continuing to carry out a series of extremely dangerous activities in Laos: (1) They continue to attack the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces' Second Battalion, brutally sweeping the mountains, robbing the people, and raping women. At the same time, sweeps have been launched in the provinces of Khammouane, Sam Neua, Savannakhet, Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, etc., causing significant losses to the people's lives and property; (2) They have intensified their suppression of Lao patriots and peace-loving people, launching a so-called "denunciation of the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces" movement. Many concentration camps have been set up to imprison former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces personnel, former resistance personnel, and other patriots; (3) The Lao authorities, in the form of a joint communiqué with the French authorities, are blatantly attempting to legalize the illegal act of importing a large number of American military personnel and weapons into Laos. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are also actively seeking opportunities to militarily intervene in Laos in various forms; (4) Under the orders of the United States, the Sananikone government has hastily dispatched a large number of troops to the Lao-Vietnamese border and declared a state of emergency in five provinces. The Sananikone government has written a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, shamelessly slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos and distorting the truth about the situation in Laos, attempting to cover up its actions in violating the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements; (5) What is particularly serious is that, at the instigation of US imperialism, the Sananikone government arrested Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, Member of Parliament of the Kingdom of Laos, and former Minister of the Coalition Government, on July 28. They also arrested other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party in Vientiane, most of whom are members of parliament, and claimed to impose severe sentences on them, which made our Lao people feel extremely angry.

The letter said, "The above-mentioned actions of US imperialism and the Sananikone government prove that they disregard the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, disregard the condemnation of them by the Lao people and world public opinion, prove that they violate the path of peace and neutrality and the policy of national harmony and unified motherland, and that they deliberately take a further step on the road to civil war, in order to eliminate the Lao patriotic and progressive forces, conspire to establish a militarist dictatorship in Laos, and turn Laos into a US military base for launching wars in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The letter also said that, faced with the current extremely serious situation in Laos, as a party to the signing of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements on Laos, we believe it is necessary to state our position on the following points:

	(1) US imperialism is the mastermind and chief culprit behind the bloody crimes that created the current tense situation in Laos. The Sananikone government and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are the capable pawns and accomplices of US imperialism. US imperialism and the Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by their violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

	(2) The claims in the statements of the Sananikone government and the US State Department that Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party are cooperating with foreign countries and creating disturbances in Laos are completely fabricated and slanderous. It is US imperialism and the Sananikone government that are creating and expanding the civil war in Laos. At present, apart from French troops and American advisors and military personnel who have illegally invaded Laos, there are no other foreign troops in Laos.

The Sananikone clique must immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party; all American advisors and military personnel must be withdrawn from Laos immediately.

	(3) The Lao people are very eager for peace. The reason why the Lao people are engaged in self-defense is because the Sananikone clique, obeying the orders of US imperialism, attempts to use force to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao people's patriotic anti-American movement.

It is absolutely necessary for the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao people to fight to defend the path of peace and neutrality, to defend national harmony and national unification, and to oppose the interference of US imperialism, to oppose the persecution and suppression by the Phoui Sananikone government, and to oppose the violators of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. This is in line with the truth and justice, and in line with the interests and aspirations of the Lao people of all strata and all nationalities. The Lao people are determined to fight to the end to realize this aspiration.

	(4) The current political problem in Laos is an internal problem between the Lao Royal Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces. This issue must be resolved correctly in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and under the supervision and monitoring of the International Commission and the attention of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina. This issue does not belong to the United Nations.

The countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc have no right to interfere in the Lao issue. If the reactionary group of a certain country in this bloc dares to infringe on the sovereignty of Laos and send military forces to Laos, the Lao people will resolutely fight to the end to defend the motherland, until the last drop of blood is shed.

The letter said that, in the face of the current situation in Laos, it is absolutely necessary for the Lao International Control and Supervisory Commission to resume its activities. The letter requested Lieutenant General Bal, in his capacity as Chairman of the Lao International Control and Supervisory Commission, to take urgent measures so that the Lao International Commission can resume its activities in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, sternly condemning the Lao Kingdom Government's Deputy Minister of National Defense Nosavan's statement on August 13 as a rude slander against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In his statement, Nosavan insisted that a battalion of troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had "invaded" the territory of Laos.

The statement first and foremost clearly pointed out once again, with irrefutable facts, that the civil war in Laos was launched by US imperialism and its lackey Sananikone.

The statement continued, "The contradictory statements made successively by some leaders of the Lao Kingdom Government are also sufficient to explain the truth about the civil war in Laos and shatter the slanders of the Lao Kingdom Government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The statement powerfully pointed out that just as the Lao Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Defense, and radio stations and newspapers were slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for invading the territory of the Lao Kingdom and attacking the strongholds of the Lao Kingdom's troops in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces, many figures in the Lao authorities admitted that there were no troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Lao territory.

The statement then listed examples of this. It pointed out that the Lao Kingdom's Foreign Minister Phagna had said on July 23, 1959, that "Currently, there are no Viet Minh troops in Laos." Lao Prime Minister Sananikone also said when answering questions from Agence France-Presse reporters on August 13 that he "did not believe that there were any Viet Minh regular troops in Laos, except for indirect assistance."

The statement also pointed out that "The Lao Kingdom Government's continuous slander of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of the Lao Kingdom, and the launch of a propaganda offensive hostile to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the issuing of war cries, are all aimed at diverting public opinion in order to cover up the increasingly rampant interference of US imperialism in Laos and the collusion between the Sananikone government and the Thai government and with the South Vietnamese authorities."

The statement concluded, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests the above-mentioned slanders by the Lao Kingdom's Deputy Minister of National Defense. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that in order to stabilize the situation in Laos and ensure peace in Indochina, the Lao Kingdom Government must stop distorting the facts and engaging in slanderous propaganda, and must strictly abide by the Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces."

    老挝爱国战线党再函国际委员会
    老挝人民决为保卫祖国利益战斗到底
    越南外交部发言人斥责老挝政府的无耻诬蔑
    新华社河内15日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，老挝爱国战线党副主席费当8月9日再次代表爱国战线党中央委员会写信给老挝国际委员会主席巴尔中将，控诉美国和老挝萨纳尼空当局继续把老挝局势推向更严重的境地，并再一次表明老挝爱国战线党对当前老挝局势问题的立场。
    信中郑重指出，美国和萨纳尼空当局正继续在老挝进行一系列极其危险的活动：（一）他们继续进攻前寮国战斗部队第二营，残酷扫荡山区，抢劫人民、奸淫妇女。同时，在甘蒙、桑怒、沙湾拿吉、琅勃拉邦、丰沙里等省展开了扫荡，使人民的生命财产遭受重大损失；（二）他们变本加厉地镇压老挝爱国、爱和平的人士，展开所谓“控诉寮国战斗部队”的运动。设立许多集中营来监禁前寮国战斗部队人员、前抗战人员和其他爱国者；（三）老挝同法国当局以发表联合公报的形式，明目张胆地企图把美国大量军事人员和武器输入老挝的非法行为合法化。东南亚条约侵略集团和吴庭艳当局也大肆活动，打算利用机会，通过各种形式来向老挝进行军事干涉；（四）根据美国的命令，萨纳尼空政府已经急忙派遣大批军队到老挝和越南边境，并且在五省宣布紧急状态。萨纳尼空政府已经写了一封信给联合国秘书长，厚颜无耻地诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝并且歪曲老挝局势的真相，企图借此掩盖它破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为；（五）特别严重的是，在美帝国主义的唆使下，萨纳尼空政府7月28日逮捕了老挝爱国战线党中央执行委员会主席、老挝王国国会议员、前联合政府部长苏发努冯亲王，他们同时逮捕了大部分是国会议员的在万象的老挝爱国战线党其他领导人，并且声称要对他们处以重刑，这使我们老挝人民感到无比的愤怒。
    这封信说，“美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府的上述行为，证明他们无视日内瓦协议和万象协议，无视老挝人民和世界人民的舆论对他们的谴责，证明他们违背了和平中立路线和民族和睦、统一祖国政策，他们蓄意在内战的道路上前进一步，以便消灭老挝爱国和进步力量、阴谋在老挝设立军国主义的独裁法西斯制度，把老挝变成美国在印度支那和东南亚发动战争的军事基地。”
    这封信又说，面对老挝当前极其严重的局势，作为签订关于老挝日内瓦协议和万象协议的一方，我们认为有必要就下列各点声明我们的立场：
      （一）美帝国主义是制造老挝当前紧张局势血腥罪行的主谋和元凶。萨纳尼空政府和“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们是美帝国主义的得力走狗和同谋。美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府必须对他们破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议所造成的严重后果负全部责任。
      （二）萨纳尼空政府和美国国务院的声明中所谓苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人同外国合作和在老挝制造骚乱的论调完全是捏造和污蔑。制造和扩大老挝内战的正是美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府。目前，除了法国军队以及非法侵入老挝的美国顾问和军事人员以外，在老挝没有其他外国军队。
    萨纳尼空集团必须立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由；必须立即把所有的美国顾问和军事人员从老挝撤出。
      （三）老挝人民非常渴望和平，老挝人民所以要进行自卫战斗，是因为萨纳尼空集团遵从美帝国主义的命令，企图用武力消灭前寮国战斗部队和老挝人民的爱国反美运动。
    前寮国战斗部队和老挝人民为反对美帝国主义的干涉，反对培·萨纳尼空政府的迫害镇压，反对日内瓦协议和万象协议的破坏者以保卫和平中立路线、保卫民族和睦和国家统一而进行战斗是完全必要的，是符合真理和正义、符合老挝各阶层人民和老挝各民族的利益和愿望的。老挝人民决心为实现这种愿望战斗到底。
      （四）老挝当前的政治问题是老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间的内部问题。这个问题必须正确地按照日内瓦协议和万象协议的精神和规定，并且在国际委员会的监察和监督和关于印度支那问题日内瓦会议的两位主席的关注下，进行解决。这个问题并不属于联合国的事情。
    东南亚条约侵略集团的国家无权干涉老挝问题。假如这个集团的某一个国家的反动集团胆敢侵犯老挝的主权，派遣军事力量到老挝，老挝人民将为保卫祖国坚决战斗到底，直到流下最后一滴血。
    信中说，面对着老挝当前的局势，老挝国际监察和监督委员会的恢复活动是非常必要的事情。信中要求巴尔中将以老挝国际监察和监督委员会的身份采取紧急的措施，使老挝国际委员会能在最近的日子里恢复活动。
    新华社河内15日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明，严词斥责老挝王国政府国防副大臣诺沙万8月13日的声明是对越南民主共和国粗暴的污蔑。诺沙万在他的声明中曾经硬说越南民主共和国的一个营的军队“侵入了”老挝的领土。
      声明首先再一次以无可辩驳的事实明确指出，老挝的内战是由美帝国主义和它的爪牙萨纳尼空发动的。
    声明接着说，“老挝王国政府的一些领导人先后发表的自相矛盾的声明也足以说明老挝内战的真象，并且粉碎老挝王国政府对越南民主共和国的污蔑”。
    声明有力地指出，正当老挝宣传部、国防部以及广播电台和报纸污蔑越南民主共和国侵犯老挝王国领土、进攻老挝王国军队在丰沙里和桑怒两省的据点的时候，老挝当局的许多人物都承认，在老挝领土上没有越南民主共和国的军队。
    声明接着列举了这方面的事例。它指出，老挝王国外交大臣班雅曾经在1959年7月23日说，“目前，在老挝没有越盟军队”。老挝首相萨纳尼空8月13日答法新社记者问时也说，他“不认为在老挝有任何越盟正规部队，除了间接的援助之外”。
    声明还指出，“老挝王国政府不断污蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝王国内政，并且展开了敌视越南民主共和国的宣传攻势和发出战争叫嚣，都是为了转移舆论视听，以便掩盖美帝国主义对老挝越来越猖狂的干涉和萨纳尼空政府同泰国政府以及同南越当局的勾结”。
    声明最后说，“越南民主共和国政府强烈抗议老挝王国国防副大臣的上述污蔑。越南民主共和国政府认为，为了稳定老挝局势和保障印度支那的和平，老挝王国政府必须停止歪曲事实的污蔑宣传，必须严格履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队签订的协议”。
