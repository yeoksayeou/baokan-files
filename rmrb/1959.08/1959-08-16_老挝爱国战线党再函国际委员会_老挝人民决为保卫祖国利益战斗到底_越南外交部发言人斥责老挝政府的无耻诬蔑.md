Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th. According to a Vietnam News Agency report today, Phaydang Lobliayao, Vice-Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Patriotic Front Party, wrote again on August 9 to Lieutenant General Bal, Chairman of the International Commission in Laos, accusing the United States and the Lao Sananikone authorities of continuing to push the situation in Laos towards a more serious state, and reiterated the Lao Patriotic Front Party's position on the current situation in Laos.

The letter solemnly pointed out that the United States and the Sananikone authorities are continuing to carry out a series of extremely dangerous activities in Laos: (1) They continue to attack the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces' Second Battalion, brutally sweeping the mountains, robbing the people, and raping women. At the same time, sweeps have been launched in the provinces of Khammouane, Sam Neua, Savannakhet, Luang Prabang, Phongsaly, etc., causing significant losses to the people's lives and property; (2) They have intensified their suppression of Lao patriots and peace-loving people, launching a so-called "denunciation of the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces" movement. Many concentration camps have been set up to imprison former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces personnel, former resistance personnel, and other patriots; (3) The Lao authorities, in the form of a joint communiqu√© with the French authorities, are blatantly attempting to legalize the illegal act of importing a large number of American military personnel and weapons into Laos. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are also actively seeking opportunities to militarily intervene in Laos in various forms; (4) Under the orders of the United States, the Sananikone government has hastily dispatched a large number of troops to the Lao-Vietnamese border and declared a state of emergency in five provinces. The Sananikone government has written a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, shamelessly slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos and distorting the truth about the situation in Laos, attempting to cover up its actions in violating the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements; (5) What is particularly serious is that, at the instigation of US imperialism, the Sananikone government arrested Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, Member of Parliament of the Kingdom of Laos, and former Minister of the Coalition Government, on July 28. They also arrested other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party in Vientiane, most of whom are members of parliament, and claimed to impose severe sentences on them, which made our Lao people feel extremely angry.

The letter said, "The above-mentioned actions of US imperialism and the Sananikone government prove that they disregard the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, disregard the condemnation of them by the Lao people and world public opinion, prove that they violate the path of peace and neutrality and the policy of national harmony and unified motherland, and that they deliberately take a further step on the road to civil war, in order to eliminate the Lao patriotic and progressive forces, conspire to establish a militarist dictatorship in Laos, and turn Laos into a US military base for launching wars in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

The letter also said that, faced with the current extremely serious situation in Laos, as a party to the signing of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements on Laos, we believe it is necessary to state our position on the following points:

	(1) US imperialism is the mastermind and chief culprit behind the bloody crimes that created the current tense situation in Laos. The Sananikone government and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are the capable pawns and accomplices of US imperialism. US imperialism and the Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by their violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

	(2) The claims in the statements of the Sananikone government and the US State Department that Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party are cooperating with foreign countries and creating disturbances in Laos are completely fabricated and slanderous. It is US imperialism and the Sananikone government that are creating and expanding the civil war in Laos. At present, apart from French troops and American advisors and military personnel who have illegally invaded Laos, there are no other foreign troops in Laos.

The Sananikone clique must immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party; all American advisors and military personnel must be withdrawn from Laos immediately.

	(3) The Lao people are very eager for peace. The reason why the Lao people are engaged in self-defense is because the Sananikone clique, obeying the orders of US imperialism, attempts to use force to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao people's patriotic anti-American movement.

It is absolutely necessary for the former Pathet Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao people to fight to defend the path of peace and neutrality, to defend national harmony and national unification, and to oppose the interference of US imperialism, to oppose the persecution and suppression by the Phoui Sananikone government, and to oppose the violators of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. This is in line with the truth and justice, and in line with the interests and aspirations of the Lao people of all strata and all nationalities. The Lao people are determined to fight to the end to realize this aspiration.

	(4) The current political problem in Laos is an internal problem between the Lao Royal Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces. This issue must be resolved correctly in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and under the supervision and monitoring of the International Commission and the attention of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina. This issue does not belong to the United Nations.

The countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc have no right to interfere in the Lao issue. If the reactionary group of a certain country in this bloc dares to infringe on the sovereignty of Laos and send military forces to Laos, the Lao people will resolutely fight to the end to defend the motherland, until the last drop of blood is shed.

The letter said that, in the face of the current situation in Laos, it is absolutely necessary for the Lao International Control and Supervisory Commission to resume its activities. The letter requested Lieutenant General Bal, in his capacity as Chairman of the Lao International Control and Supervisory Commission, to take urgent measures so that the Lao International Commission can resume its activities in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 15th. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, sternly condemning the Lao Kingdom Government's Deputy Minister of National Defense Nosavan's statement on August 13 as a rude slander against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In his statement, Nosavan insisted that a battalion of troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had "invaded" the territory of Laos.

The statement first and foremost clearly pointed out once again, with irrefutable facts, that the civil war in Laos was launched by US imperialism and its lackey Sananikone.

The statement continued, "The contradictory statements made successively by some leaders of the Lao Kingdom Government are also sufficient to explain the truth about the civil war in Laos and shatter the slanders of the Lao Kingdom Government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The statement powerfully pointed out that just as the Lao Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Defense, and radio stations and newspapers were slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for invading the territory of the Lao Kingdom and attacking the strongholds of the Lao Kingdom's troops in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces, many figures in the Lao authorities admitted that there were no troops from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Lao territory.

The statement then listed examples of this. It pointed out that the Lao Kingdom's Foreign Minister Phagna had said on July 23, 1959, that "Currently, there are no Viet Minh troops in Laos." Lao Prime Minister Sananikone also said when answering questions from Agence France-Presse reporters on August 13 that he "did not believe that there were any Viet Minh regular troops in Laos, except for indirect assistance."

The statement also pointed out that "The Lao Kingdom Government's continuous slander of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of the Lao Kingdom, and the launch of a propaganda offensive hostile to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the issuing of war cries, are all aimed at diverting public opinion in order to cover up the increasingly rampant interference of US imperialism in Laos and the collusion between the Sananikone government and the Thai government and with the South Vietnamese authorities."

The statement concluded, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests the above-mentioned slanders by the Lao Kingdom's Deputy Minister of National Defense. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that in order to stabilize the situation in Laos and ensure peace in Indochina, the Lao Kingdom Government must stop distorting the facts and engaging in slanderous propaganda, and must strictly abide by the Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Forces."
