　　Seizing Time from the Heavens, Seizing Profit from the Land
　　Shanxi Launches a "Surpass Production Quota" Campaign

　　This dispatch from Taiyuan on the 10th: The broad masses of peasants and cadres in Shanxi Province are redoubling their efforts and making a final push in August, focusing on the processing and management of autumn fields. A vigorous "surpass production quota" campaign to ensure a bumper harvest and strive for an even greater bumper harvest has been launched throughout the province.

　　Currently, in the Jin Southeast region of the Taihang Mountains, which is rich in coarse grains, corn is in full bloom, millet is generally heading, cotton in the Jin South plains is bearing abundant bolls, and potato flowers are blooming luxuriantly in the Jin North Saiwai region. The majority of the province's more than 46 million mu of autumn crops have strong stalks and lush leaves, and are flowering and bearing ears. The labor enthusiasm of the peasants in various places is high. Faced with the good foundation for a bumper harvest that has already emerged, leaders at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee on exceeding the high-yield plan, have generally put forward new targets and new measures for seizing time from the heavens, seizing profit from the land, and overproducing grain based on the actual conditions of their localities and giving full play to all possible potential for increased production.

　　August is a crucial season for the autumn harvest in Shanxi Province. The leading departments in various places generally regard this period as the decisive month for achieving a large autumn harvest, reviewing and summarizing the autumn field management work of the previous period. Through methods such as on-site inspections and comparisons with the past, they eliminated the right-leaning conservative sentiments among some cadres and masses, universally mobilized the masses to tap all possible measures for increasing production, and put forward targets for surpassing production quotas in light of local conditions. Many counties, communes, and management areas in the Jin Southeast Special Zone have proposed to increase production by 10% or 20% on the basis of achieving the original production plan and contracted production targets. Various places in the Jinzhong Special Zone are aiming for an average overproduction of ten to twenty jin per mu. In Zuoyun County in the Jin North plateau, the autumn field sowing area of eleven communes has expanded by more than 20% compared with last year, the amount of fertilizer applied has doubled, the irrigated area has expanded rapidly, and field processing is generally earlier, more meticulous, more frequent, and better than in previous years. On this favorable basis, the county committee universally launched a campaign to surpass production quotas. In addition to putting forward field management measures to ensure overproduction, they also evaluated and selected more than ten communes, management areas, and production teams that were advanced in fertilizer, water conservancy, summer hoeing, and labor management throughout the county as pacesetters for the competition. In addition, overproduction movement inspection and evaluation committees and production responsibility areas were also established in each commune.

　　Since the launch of the overproduction movement in various places, all favorable factors have been mobilized, all difficulties have been overcome, and the current rural production work has been powerfully promoted. At present, the number of people in the province engaged in autumn field management has increased sharply to more than 4 million, and 70% to 80% of the rural labor force has been involved in the overproduction movement. Large-scale accumulation and production of fertilizer is underway everywhere, the area of topdressing is being actively expanded, the speed of topdressing is being accelerated, and weeding, pest control, soil cultivation, and water conservancy work have all been comprehensively developed. Currently, 19 counties in the Jin Southeast and Jin South Special Zones of Shanxi Province have been experiencing prolonged drought, and it appears that the drought is still developing. The broad masses and cadres in these areas have been urgently mobilized to fight the drought and strive to ensure a bumper harvest.

　　与天争时　与地争利
　　山西掀起超包产运动
    本报太原10日电　山西省广大农民和干部再鼓干劲、决战8月份，主攻秋田加工管理，全省范围内轰轰烈烈地掀起了确保丰收、力争更大丰收的超包产运动。
    目前，盛产杂粮的太行山晋东南地区，玉米天花盛开，谷子普遍抽穗，晋南平川的棉花结桃累累，晋北塞上地区山药蛋花朵怒放。全省四千六百多万亩秋季作物大部分秆壮叶茂，开花孕穗。各地农民劳动情绪高涨，面临着已经呈现出的良好的丰收基础，各级领导根据中共山西省委和省人民委员会关于超额完成丰产计划的指示，普遍针对当地的实际情况，充分发挥一切可能增产的潜力，提出了与天争时、与地争利、多超产粮食的新指标新措施。
    8月份是山西省秋作物丰收的关键季节。各地领导部门普遍把这一时期作为实现秋季大丰收的决战月，检查总结了前一时期秋田管理工作，通过现场看、和过去比等办法，破除部分干部和群众中的右倾保守情绪，普遍发动群众，挖掘一切可以利用的增产措施，并因地制宜地提出了超包产的指标。晋东南专区不少县、公社、管理区提出要在实现原生产计划和包产指标的基础上，增产一成或二成。晋中专区各地要平均每亩超产十斤到二十斤。晋北高原左云县十一个公社秋田播种面积比去年扩大了20％多，施肥量增加了一倍，灌溉面积迅速扩大，田间加工普遍比往年早、细、多、好。在这有利的基础上，经过县委普遍发动掀起超产竞赛。除了提出保证超产的田间管理措施，并在全县范围内评比出在肥料、水利、夏锄、劳动管理等方面工作先进的十多个公社、管理区和生产队，作为竞赛的标兵。另外，在各公社还建立了超产运动检查评比委员会和生产责任区。
    各地开展超产运动以后，调动一切有利因素，克服一切困难，有力地推动了当前农村生产工作。现在，全省投入秋田管理的人数已急剧增加到四百多万人，农村70％到80％的劳力卷入了超产运动。各地大积大制肥料，积极扩大追肥面积，加快追肥速度，除草、治虫、培土以及水利工作，都得到了全面发展。目前，山西省晋东南和晋南专区有十九个县久旱不雨，从目前看旱象仍在发展。这些地区的广大群众和干部已紧急动员起来，奋力抗旱，力保丰收。
