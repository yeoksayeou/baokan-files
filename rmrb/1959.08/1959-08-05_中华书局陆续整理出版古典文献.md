Zhonghua Book Company Continues to Organize and Publish Classical Literature

    The main publishing task of Zhonghua Book Company is to organize and publish China's classical literature (ancient books). Its guiding principle in organizing and publishing ancient books is to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and to "make the past serve the present." It mainly publishes the works of ancient people, but it serves the people of today.
  Classical Literature Anthologies, Special Collections, and Modern Literature Works
    Zhonghua Book Company plans to mainly publish ancient and modern literary works in the following four areas this year.
    In order to provide researchers with more systematic materials, a batch of classical literary works' anthologies will be organized and published. The already published ones include "Complete Prose of the Ancient, Three Dynasties, Qin, Han, Three Kingdoms, and Six Dynasties" and "Complete Poetry of the Han, Three Kingdoms, Jin, and Northern and Southern Dynasties." These two books can be said to be companion pieces. The former collects single articles from nearly three thousand five hundred writers (some are not writers, but legendary figures) from the ancient Three Dynasties to the Sui Dynasty, and the latter collects all the poems and Yuefu from the Han to the Sui Dynasties. With these two books, checking articles and poems before the Sui Dynasty no longer requires extensive searching through numerous books. This is very convenient for readers. The books to be published in the second half of the year include "Complete Tang Poems," "Complete Song Ci," "Extra Compilation of Yuan Drama Selections," and "Qing Poetry Compendium," etc. The contents of "Complete Tang Poems" and "Complete Song Ci" are self-explanatory. "Extra Compilation of Yuan Drama Selections" collects sixty-two kinds of zaju from the Yuan and Yuan-Ming transition periods other than the famous "Yuan Drama Selections." Combined with "Yuan Drama Selections," it can be regarded as a complete collection of Yuan zaju. Qing Dynasty poetry has not been highly valued in the past. This "Qing Poetry Compendium" collects many poems reflecting social and political situations and class contradictions and is a featured Qing poetry compilation. Except for "Complete Song Ci," which was compiled by Tang Guizhang, and "Extra Compilation of Yuan Drama Selections," which was compiled by Sui Shusen, all the above books were compiled by predecessors. Zhonghua Book Company has added punctuation to all of them during this publication and made necessary collations.
    There were many progressive writers and writers with patriotic ideas in our history. Organizing and publishing the works of these writers is also one of the key tasks of Zhonghua Book Company. The publications planned for this year include "Collected Works of Cao Cao" (already published), "Poems of Nie Yizhong and Du Xunhe" (already published), "Pi Ziwen Sou," "Collected Works of Zhang Cangshui" (already published), "Collected Works of Xia Wanchun," and "Handwritten Poems of Gui Zhuang," etc.
    The two sets of modern literature series compiled by A Ying for Zhonghua Book Company are of great help to those who study modern Chinese literature. Modern literature materials are scattered in many newspapers, periodicals, and literary collections, which are very difficult to collect. Therefore, those who study modern literature often feel a lack of information. After years of accumulation, A Ying compiled two sets of series, one is "Collection of Modern Chinese Anti-Aggression Literature," and the other is "Late Qing Literature Series." This solves the big problem for those who study modern literature. The first set of books has five parts in total. "Opium War Literature Collection," "Sino-French War Literature Collection," "Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu Literature Collection," and "Boxer Rebellion Literature Collection" have been published. The "Anti-American Chinese Workers Exclusion Act Literature Collection," which can be published in the second half of this year, will complete the series. The second set of books has ten parts, which classify and compile the literary materials of the late Qing Dynasty into various parts. The proposed catalog is as follows: (1) Literature Theory Volume; (2) Novel and Drama Research Volume; (3) Poetry Volume; (4) Vernacular Literature Volume; (5) Legend Volume; (6) to (8) Novel Volume; (9) Foreign Literature Volume; (10) Prose and Essays Volume. The "Novel and Drama Research Volume" and "Legend Volume" can be published this year, and the entire set will be published next year.
    In order to supply the needs of general cadres (including some of the masses), Zhonghua Book Company has also begun to do some work in popularizing classical literature. In order to make this work more planned, the bureau is publishing a set of "Popular Classical Literature Readings." This set of readings focuses on selecting works with democratic essence that are popular among the masses; in terms of organizing methods, attention is paid to adopting various methods of selection and annotation, selection and translation, adaptation, and rewriting according to the form and content of the works. The already published ones include "Selected Translations of Stories from Records of the Grand Historian," "One Hundred Tang Poems," and "Female General Mu Guiying." The ones to be published include "Selected Ancient Folk Songs," "One Hundred Song Poems," and "Selected Ancient Dramas," etc.
    Biographical, Chronological History Books and Archival Historical Materials
    The main target readers of Zhonghua Book Company's publications of ancient and modern historical works and data collections are researchers, educators, and some cadres with higher cultural levels. Because the vast majority of ancient historical books are reference books, and very few can be used as general readings, a small number of selectable readings can be treated as classical literature readings. Zhonghua Book Company mainly plans to publish ancient and modern historical books and data books in the following three areas this year.
    Biographical history books are the main historical books in our country. From Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian" to the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty," the biographical history books of past dynasties have been continuously recorded, recording the main political, economic, and cultural life of our country for more than three thousand years. Anyone who is engaged in the study of our history or further delves into our history must read biographical history books. These types of books are generally called the Twenty-Four Histories, or Twenty-Five Histories. Starting this year, Zhonghua Book Company plans to organize and publish a set of punctuated biographical history books in four to five years. The organization of this set of books is carried out with the help of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, mobilizing many historians across the country. This year, "Records of the Grand Historian" and "Records of the Three Kingdoms" can be published. In addition, in order to concentrate the achievements of predecessors in sorting out and collating the first ten combined histories from the "Records of the Grand Historian" to the "History of the Five Dynasties," Zhonghua Book Company also plans to organize and publish the collected commentaries or combined transcripts of the first ten combined histories. This work can begin in the second half of this year.
    Chronological history books are also the main historical books in our country. Sima Guang's "Zizhi Tongjian" is the most famous. This book, together with Bi Yuan's "Continuation of Zizhi Tongjian," has been organized and published by the former Guji Publishing House (now merged into Zhonghua Book Company) and has been welcomed by readers. This year, Zhonghua Book Company has sorted out "Guo Que" and "Ming Tongjian," which can continue "Continuation of Tongjian." So far, a set of chronological history books in our country has been sorted out. In addition, in order to provide reading materials for cadres and teachers with secondary cultural levels, Zhonghua Book Company plans to punctuate and publish "Outline and Mirror Made Easy to Understand," which can be regarded as a simplified version of the previous books, this year.
    Many important historical materials from the Qing Dynasty are preserved in unorganized archives, and few people have the opportunity to see them. In order to provide for research work and practical work needs, the State Archives Administration's Ming and Qing Archives plans to classify and organize the deputy memorial books of the Qing Military Aircraft Department from the eighth year of Yongzheng (1730) to the third year of Xuantong (1911) that have important historical value, and submit them to Zhonghua Book Company for publication. This year, "Historical Materials on Qing Dynasty Earthquake Archives" (already published), "Historical Materials on the Opium War Archives," "Historical Materials on Song Jingshi Archives," and "Historical Materials on the Boxer Rebellion Archives" (already published) will be published first.
    In addition, Zhonghua Book Company also plans to publish three sets of historical series of the Yuan, Ming, Qing, and modern times, special collections of modern people's memorials, essays, books, letters, and diaries with higher historical value, as well as other books with historical value, such as Zhang Dai's "Shi Kui Shu," Wu Han's "Chinese Materials in Li Dynasty Records," and Nankai University History Department's "Economic Materials in Qing Shilu" (already published), etc.
      Ancient and Modern Philosophical Materials and Special Collections
    Providing reference books and materials for those who study and learn about the history of Chinese philosophy and those who are concerned about the problems in the history of Chinese philosophy is the purpose of Zhonghua Book Company's publication of ancient philosophical books. This year's book publishing plan in this area mainly has two aspects.
      Chinese philosophical historical materials are scattered in many ancient books, which are inconvenient to check; many books are difficult to understand, which are inconvenient to study. In view of this, the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences specially organized many philosophical historians to compile three kinds of philosophical historical materials: "Selected Materials on the History of Chinese Philosophy," "Concise Edition of Selected Materials on the History of Chinese Philosophy," and "Materials on the History of Chinese Logic." The first one is a series of books. This series of books is selected from representative works of important thinkers in ancient and modern China, and is divided into seven parts: Pre-Qin, Two Han Dynasties, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming, Early Qing to the Opium War, and Modern Times. Each part is a book in itself. All are attached with modern annotations, and the Pre-Qin and Two Han parts are also added with modern translations. The Two Han and Modern parts can be published this year. "Materials on the History of Chinese Logic" is also a series of books, including the School of Names and Mohism, other Pre-Qin masters, Qin and Han to Sui and Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing, and is attached with explanations and modern translations. The School of Names and Mohism part can be published this year.
    Ancient and modern Chinese thinkers have written many valuable philosophical (ideological) monographs, which Zhonghua Book Company plans to organize and publish successively. The selection criteria for publication are mainly: (1) works with significant materialist ideas and progressive political ideas; (2) works that have a greater influence in history, are widely circulated, or are representative of a certain era or school; (3) information-based works that have important reference value for studying important schools or important issues in the history of Chinese philosophy. This year, "Collected Annotations of Zhuangzi," "Collected Collations of Sun Tzu," "Collected Annotations of Yanzi Chunqiu," "Combined Transcriptions of Taiping Jing," "Collected Writings of Shuixin" (written by Ye Shi of the Song Dynasty), "Hidden Books" (already published), "Burning Books," "Continued Burning Books" (all three books are annotated by Li Zhi of the Ming Dynasty), "Collected Writings of Wang Chuanshan," "Collected Writings of Gu Tinglin," "Collected Writings of Huang Lizhou" (already published), "Collected Writings of Gong Ding'an," and "Selected Works of Cai Yuanpei" (already published), etc. can be published.
              Encyclopedias and Reference Books
    Ancient Chinese encyclopedias are similar to modern encyclopedias, classifying and copying various related materials and books into them. These books preserve a large amount of historical and literary materials, which can be used by researchers, educators, and cadres for reference. Because many books are copied in them, some of the original books have been lost, and they can be collected from encyclopedias, and some can be used to collate existing ancient books due to different versions. Zhonghua Book Company plans to publish four kinds of large encyclopedias this year. One is "Yiwen Leiju" (already published), which was compiled by Ouyang Xun of the Tang Dynasty and is one of the earliest existing encyclopedias in our country. One is "Taiping Yulan," which was compiled in the early Song Dynasty, with a total of 1,000 volumes. One is "Cefu Yuangui," which was also compiled in the early Song Dynasty, also with 1,000 volumes. This book has not been printed for about 300 years. One is "Yongle Encyclopedia," which was compiled during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty and is a world-famous book. The original book only has handwritten copies and has never been printed in large quantities. Now, with the help of the Beijing Library, Zhonghua Book Company has reproduced all the originals and photos it can collect.
    Reference books are of great convenience to researchers and cadres. The reference books published by Zhonghua Book Company are all related to reading ancient books or studying ancient Chinese life and culture. The large-scale reference book "General Catalog of National Series" will be published this year, with a total of nine volumes, which was edited by the Shanghai Library. There are many series of books in our country, and it is extremely inconvenient to check them. This book collects the series of books that can be collected and compiles them into an index. The first volume can be published this year. In addition, Zhonghua Book Company also plans to publish "General Catalog Index of Dunhuang Manuscripts," "Four Thousand Years of Solar Terms and Eclipses Calculation Table," and "Comprehensive Table of Years, Residences, Tomb Inscriptions, and Biographies of Historical Figures," etc., which will be helpful for those who study Chinese history and ancient culture.

    中华书局陆续整理出版古典文献
    中华书局的主要出版任务是整理出版我国古典文献（古籍）。在整理出版古籍中，它的指导方针是贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣，做到古为今用。它主要出版的是古人的东西，而它所要服务的却是今人。
  古典文学总集、专集和近代文学著作
    中华书局今年主要计划出版以下四个方面的古代近代文学作品。
    为了给研究工作者提供比较有系统的资料，整理出版一批古典文学作品的总集。已经出版的，有“全上古三代秦汉三国六朝文”和
  “全汉三国晋南北朝诗”。这两部书可以说是姊妹篇。前一部书收集了从上古三代到隋朝为止近三千五百个作家（有的不是作家，而是传说中的人物）的单篇文章，后一部书收集了从汉到隋所有的诗歌乐府。有了这两部书，检查隋以前的文章和诗歌，就不用大翻群书了。这对读者有很大方便。下半年要出版的，有“全唐诗”、“全宋词”、“元曲选外编”和“清诗铎”等。“全唐诗”和“全宋词”两部书，不用解释，看到名字就会知道它们的内容。“元曲选外编”收集了著名的“元曲选”以外的六十二种元代及元明之际的杂剧，与“元曲选”合起来，可以看作一部元杂剧的总集。清朝的诗，一向不大为人所重视，这部“清诗铎”收集了不少反映社会政治情况和阶级矛盾的诗，是一部具有特色的清诗类编。以上各书除“全宋词”是今人唐圭璋编的和“元曲选外编”是隋树森编的外，都是前人编的，中华书局在这次出版时，都加了断句，并做了必要的校勘。
    我国历史上有许多进步的和具有爱国主义思想的作家。整理出版这些作家的作品，也是中华书局的重点工作之一。今年计划出版的，有“曹操集”（已出）、“聂夷中杜荀鹤诗”（已出）、“皮子文薮”、“张苍水集”（已出）、“夏完淳集”和“归庄手写诗稿”等。
    阿英为中华书局编的两套近代文学丛书，对研究我国近代文学的人有很大帮助。近代文学的资料，散见在许多报刊和文集中，很不容易收集。因此，研究近代文学的人常常感到资料缺乏。阿英经多年的积累，编辑成两套丛书，一套是“中国近代反侵略文学集”，一套是“晚清文学丛钞”。这就为研究近代文学的人解决了很大的问题。前一套书共五部，已出版了“鸦片战争文学集”、“中法战争文学集”、“甲午中日战争文学集”和“庚子事变文学集”，再加上今年下半年可以出版的“反美华工禁约文学集”，就出齐了。后一套书共十部，把晚清的文学资料分门别类地编进各部书中，拟目如下：（一）文学论卷；（二）小说戏曲研究卷，（三）诗词卷；（四）俗文学卷；
  （五）传奇卷；（六）到（八）小说卷；（九）外国文学卷；（十）散文与杂文卷。今年可以出版“小说戏曲研究卷”和“传奇卷”，全套书明年出齐。
    为了供给一般干部（包括一部分群众）需要，中华书局在使古典文学通俗化上也开始作一些工作。为了使这项工作作得有计划一些，该局正在出版一套“古典文学普及读物”。这套读物在选题上注意挑选具有民主性精华，并且为大众所喜闻乐见的作品；在整理方法上注
  意按作品的形式和内容，分别采用选注、选译、改编和改写的各种方式。已经出版的，有“史记故事选译”、“唐诗一百首”和“女将穆桂英”，将要出版的，有“古代民歌选”、“宋诗一百首”和“古代戏曲选”等。
    纪传体、编年体史书和档案史料
    中华书局出版古代近代历史著作和资料集，其主要读者对象为研究工作者、教育工作者和一部分文化水平较高的干部。因为历史古籍，绝大部分是资料书，可作为一般读物的很少，少数可以选读的，可以作为古典文学读物来处理。中华书局今年主要计划出版以下三个方面的古代近代历史古籍和资料书。
    纪传体史书是我国主要的历史古籍，从司马迁的“史记”起，到“清史稿”为止，历代的纪传体史书连续不绝，记载了我国三千余年的主要政治、经济和文化生活情况。凡是从事我国历史研究或进一步涉猎我国历史的人，都要读纪传体史书。这一类书，我们通名之为二十四史，或二十五史。中华书局从今年起，计划用四、五年时间整理出版一套标点本的纪传体史书。这一套书的整理工作，是在中国科学院历史研究所帮助之下，动员了全国许多史学工作者进行的。今年可以出版“史记”和“三国志”。另外，为了集中前人对于“史记”到
  “五代史”前十合史的整理和校勘的成果，中华书局还计划整理出版前十合史的集解本或合钞本。这项工作，今年下半年可以开始进行。
    编年体史书，也是我国主要的历史古籍。司马光的“资治通鉴”是最出名的。这部书连同毕沅的“续资治通鉴”，已由前古籍出版社（已并入中华书局）整理出版，受到读者的欢迎。今年中华书局又把可以接续“续通鉴”的“国榷”和“明通鉴”整理出来了。至此，我国的一套编年体史书就整理出齐了。此外，中华书局为了供具有中等文化水平的干部和教师阅读，今年还计划把可以视为前几部书的简编的“纲鉴易知录”标点出版。
    清代的许多重要史料，保存在未经整理的档案中，很少人有机会看到。国家档案局明清档案馆为了供研究工作和实际工作的需要，计划把从雍正八年（1730年）到宣统三年（1911年）清军机处录副奏折中有重要史料价值的陆续分类整理，交中华书局出版。今年先出版
  “清代地震档案史料”（已出）、“鸦片战争档案史料”、“宋景诗档案史料”和“义和团档案史料”（已出）。
    此外，中华书局还计划出版元明、清代和近代三套历史丛刊，近代人史料价值较高的奏议、文集、书牍和日记之类的专集，以及其他富有史料价值的书籍，如张岱的“石匮书”、吴晗编的“李朝实保中的中国资料”和南开大学历史学系编的“清实录经济资料”（已出）等。
      古代近代哲学资料和专集
    为研究学习我国哲学史和关心我国哲学史中的问题的人提供参考书籍和资料，是中华书局出版哲学古籍的目的。今年这方面的出书计划，主要有两个方面。
      中国哲学史料散见于许多古籍中，不便检阅；许多书籍文字难懂，不便研读。中国科学院哲学研究所有鉴于此，特别组织了许多哲学史工作者编集了三种哲学史资料：“中国哲学史资料选辑”、“中国哲学史资料选辑简编”和“中国逻辑史资料”。第一种是一套丛书。这套丛书是选辑我国古代近代重要思想家著作中的代表性作品而成，共分先秦、两汉、魏晋南北朝、隋唐五代、宋元明、清初到鸦片战争和近代七个部分，每一个部分自成一书。全部附加今注，先秦和两汉部分并加今译。两汉和近代部分今年可以出版。“中国逻辑史资料”也是一套丛书，包括名家和墨家、其他先秦名家、秦汉到隋唐、宋元明清四个部分，并附有说明和今译。名家和墨家部分今年可以出版。
    我国古代近代思想家，曾写过许多有价值的哲学（思想）专著，中华书局计划陆续整理出版。选择出版的标准主要是：（1）有显著的唯物主义思想和进步的政治思想的著作；（2）在历史上影响较大，流传较广，或在某一时代、某一学派中具有代表性的著作；（3）对研究我国哲学史上的重要派别或重要问题有重要参考价值的资料性著作。今年可以出版“庄子集释”、“孙子集校”、“晏子春秋集释”、“太平经合抄”、“水心文集”（宋代叶适著）、“藏书”（已出）、“焚书”、“续焚书”（三书都为明代李贽注）、“王船山文集”、“顾亭林文集”、“黄梨洲文集”（已出）、“龚定庵集”和“蔡元培选集”（已出）等。
              类书和工具书
    我国古代的类书近似现代的百科全书，分门别类，把各种有关的资料和书籍抄录进去。这些书中，保留了大量的历史和文学资料，可供研究工作者、教育工作者和干部查考。因为其中抄录了许多书籍，有的书原书散佚了，可以从类书中辑出，有的因版本不同，可据以校勘现有的古籍。今年中华书局计划出版的有四种大类书。一是“艺文类聚”（已出），这是唐欧阳询编修的我国现存最早的类书之一。一是“太平御览”，这是宋初编修的，全书一千卷。一是“册府元龟”，也是宋初编修的，也是一千卷，这部书约有三百年没有印过了。一是“永乐大典”，这是明朝永乐年间编修的，是世界知名的书，原书只有抄本，从未大批印过，现在中华书局在北京图书馆的帮助下把所能收集到的原本和照片，都影印出来。
    工具书对于研究工作者和干部有很大方便。中华书局出版的工具书，都是与阅读古籍或研究我国古代生活和文化有关系的。今年开始出版的大型工具书有“全国丛书综录”，共九册，这是上海图书馆编辑的。我国丛书众多，翻检极不方便。这部书把可能收集到的丛书汇集起来，编成索引，今年可以出版第一卷。此外，中华书局还计划出版“敦煌遗书总目索引”、“四千年气朔交食检算表”和“历代人物年里碑传综表”等，这对于研究我国历史和古代文化的人都是有帮助的。　（王向）
