Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd: The Jingxi Mining Bureau, while organizing a production upsurge, actively improves miners' lives to ensure their physical health.

    The Jingxi Mining Bureau Party Committee regularly studies and resolves issues related to the lives of employees. The trade union and administrative departments have also held several meetings this year to mobilize logistics staff to carry out competitions in conjunction with their work. They also frequently organize inspection tours and exchange experiences, which has greatly improved the work of canteens, medical services, culture, and other areas.

    Generally, canteens pay attention to frequently changing the variety of dishes, issuing weekly and bi-weekly menus, soliciting workers' opinions, and adding more food vending windows and extending meal times. The Fangshan Mine mobilized the masses to collect waste materials and make more than thirty water delivery carts to send hot water to the miners. They also heated the miners' dry rations at the pithead and put them in insulated vehicles to send them to all parts of the mine, which was very popular among the miners.

    All rock working faces have taken measures to reduce the proportion of rock dust in the air, and high-temperature working areas have also added cooling equipment such as electric fans and sunshades, as well as medicines and cooling drinks such as Ren Dan, Ten Drops Liquid, and salt soda. The medical departments of each mine have organized mobile medical teams for the workshops and set up health stations at the pit entrances and in the family areas. Medical personnel pay special attention to disease prevention, and before the occurrence of seasonal epidemics, they widely publicize prevention knowledge through broadcasts and big-character posters, and organize shock teams to send preventive medicines to the pit entrances for the workers. In addition, the medical departments frequently help canteens and nurseries to do a good job in sanitation.

    Because the leadership regularly cares about and continuously improves the lives of employees, the miners' production enthusiasm is even higher. In the first half of this year, the mining bureau comprehensively overfulfilled its production tasks, and in July, it also overfulfilled its coal mining and tunneling plans.

    This newspaper reports: Shuangyashan Lingxi Coal Mine, in the battle to seize more coal, actively improves the lives of its employees, ensuring that miners eat well, sleep well, and rest well, thereby powerfully promoting the large-scale bumper coal production movement.

    This mine attaches great importance to the welfare of its employees. One Party Committee Secretary, one Deputy Mine Director, and one Trade Union Chairman are in charge of employee life. Whenever the Party Committee studies production, it also studies the living conditions of employees, and resolves problems as soon as they are discovered. In improving the lives of employees, Lingxi Coal Mine has focused tightly on improving the canteen, an important part of this, and actively organized canteen service personnel to carry out red flag competitions. In the competition, canteen service personnel tried every means to ensure that miners spent less money and ate well.

    In order to ensure that miners rested well, the mine adjusted the employee dormitories, reduced the size of offices and some welfare facilities, and increased the number of accommodation houses, so that workers on the same shift lived in the same room. This overcame the problem of mixed shifts living together, which affected rest. As a result, the miners have more energy and more enthusiasm for production. In the first half of July, the average attendance rate of workers increased by nearly 3% compared with the same period in June. In addition, the mine also frequently organizes amateur cultural troupes (groups) to go deep into the wellsite to perform some entertainment programs for the workers, to invigorate the cultural life of the miners, which has also greatly promoted production.

    生产生活一齐抓精力充沛多挖煤
    京西和岭西矿千方百计保证矿工吃好休息好
    据新华社2日讯　京西矿务局在组织生产高潮的同时，积极改善矿工生活，保证矿工身体健康。
    京西矿务局党委经常研究和解决有关职工生活的问题。工会和行政方面今年也几次召开会议，发动后勤工作人员开展同业务竞赛，同时经常组织巡回检查和交流经验，使食堂、医务、文化等工作都有了很大改进。
    一般食堂都注意经常变换饭菜的花样，按周按旬排出食谱，征求工人意见，并且增设卖饭窗口，延长开饭时间。房山矿发动群众收集废料制成三十多个送水车给矿工送热水，还把矿工们的干粮在坑口热过以后放在保温车内送到井下各处，很受矿工欢迎。
    各个岩石工作面都采取措施降低空气中的岩尘比重，高温工作地点也增设了电扇、凉棚等降温设备和仁丹、十滴水、盐汽水等药品和清凉饮料。各矿医务部门组织了车间巡回医疗队，在井口和家属区设立保健站。医务人员特别注意疾病预防工作，在发生季节性流行病以前，就利用广播和大字报广泛宣传预防常识，组织突击队到井口给工人送预防药物。此外，医务部门经常帮助食堂、托儿所搞好卫生工作。
    由于领导方面经常关心和不断改善职工生活，矿工们的生产热情更加高涨。今年上半年这个矿务局全面超额完成了生产任务，7月份又超额完成了采煤和掘进计划。
    本报讯　双鸭山岭西煤矿在夺煤大战中，积极改善职工生活，保证矿工们吃好、睡好、休息好，从而有力地推动了煤炭大面积丰产运动。
    这个矿很重视职工生活福利工作，矿上有一名党委书记、一名副矿长和一名工会主席经常抓职工生活。党委每逢研究生产时，同时研究职工生活情况，发现问题，随时解决。在改善职工生活中，岭西煤矿紧紧地抓住了改进食堂这一重要环节，积极组织食堂服务人员开展红旗竞赛，在竞赛中食堂的服务人员想尽办法让矿工们花钱少，吃得好。
    为了使矿工们休息得好，这个矿调整了职工宿舍，紧缩了办公室和一些福利用房，增加了住宿房屋，做到了同班生产工人住一屋。这样就克服过去三班混住，互相影响休息的问题。因此，矿工们精力更加充沛，生产热情更加饱满。7月份上半月工人出勤率平均比6月份同期提高了近3％。此外，这个矿还经常组织业余文工队（组），深入井下现场，为工人们演出一些文娱节目，来活跃矿工们文化生活，也对生产起了很大推动作用。
