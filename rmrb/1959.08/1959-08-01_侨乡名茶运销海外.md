Famous tea from overseas Chinese hometowns is being transported and sold overseas.

The overseas Chinese hometowns of southern Fujian Province, including Pinghe, Anxi, Changtai, Yongchun, and Zhao'an counties, are rich in oolong tea, which is favored by overseas Chinese. Currently, Anxi and Zhangzhou tea factories have processed and shipped more than seven thousand boxes of various oolong teas. These are organized for export by the Xiamen Tea Export Company and are being shipped overseas to meet the needs of overseas Chinese.
