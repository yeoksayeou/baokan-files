Xinhua News Agency report: A competition agreement conference for pest elimination, hygiene promotion, and disease elimination among the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan and the three municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin was held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, from July 20th to 28th.

In addition to reviewing the implementation of the pest elimination, hygiene promotion, and disease elimination competition agreement signed by the aforementioned four provinces and three municipalities in 1958, this conference also signed the 1959 competition agreement and exchanged work experiences.

The conference noted that since the four provinces and three municipalities signed the competition agreement in Tianjin last September, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, and in close combination with production, the patriotic health movement has achieved great success, powerfully promoting industrial and agricultural production. In carrying out the health movement, various localities have adhered to the spirit of "health for production, and hygiene in production," and through the harmless treatment of feces and in conjunction with the manure accumulation movement, have eliminated a large number of mosquito and fly breeding grounds, effectively preventing or reducing the most serious acute infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and endemic diseases that endanger people's health. The conference summarized the past experiences of the four provinces and three municipalities, believing that in the future, the pest elimination and hygiene promotion movement, in addition to relying closely on the unified leadership of the Party committees, should also implement the principle of "walking on two legs," that is, combining professional health teams with the masses, combining symptomatic treatment with fundamental solutions, and combining concentrated efforts with regular work.

After full discussion and consultation, the conference signed the competition agreement for the pest elimination and hygiene promotion movement among the four provinces and three municipalities. The agreement requires the relevant areas to continue to mobilize the masses from now until the end of 1960, to make persistent efforts, to further reduce the density of the "four pests," to basically eliminate the "four pests" in all possible places, to widely carry out health propaganda and education, to popularize health knowledge, and to gradually cultivate good health habits among the masses. At the same time, in combination with manure accumulation, it is necessary to strengthen the treatment of feces, garbage, and sewage, to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and to improve environmental sanitation. In addition, it is also necessary to improve the sanitation of the food service industry, collective welfare undertakings, and factory and mine construction sites; to do a good job in the prevention and control of severe infectious diseases, reduce morbidity, and lower mortality; and to actively carry out the prevention and control of parasitic diseases and endemic diseases. The conference decided that the four provinces and three municipalities would organize a health inspection tour in late August and early September this year.

    再次签订协议书　继续发动群众 
    四省三市开展除害灭病竞赛
    据新华社讯　山西、河北、山东、河南四省和北京、上海、天津三个市除四害讲卫生消灭疾病竞赛协议会7月20日到28日在山东省青岛市举行。
    这次会议除了检查1958年上述四省三市签订的除四害讲卫生消灭疾病竞赛协议的执行情形外，还签订了1959年的竞赛协议，交流了工作经验。
    会议认为，从去年9月四省三市在天津签订竞赛协议以来，各地在党委统一领导下，紧密结合生产，使爱国卫生运动取得很大成绩，有力地促进了工农业生产。各地在开展卫生运动中，由于贯彻了卫生为生产、生产讲卫生的精神，通过对粪便无害化处理及结合积肥运动，消灭了大批蚊蝇孳生地，有效地防治或减少了危害人民健康最严重的急性传染病、寄生虫病和地方病。会议总结了过去四省三市的经验，认为今后除四害讲卫生运动，除了要紧紧依靠党委的统一领导外，还要贯彻两条腿走路的方针，即卫生专业队伍与群众相结合，治标与治本相结合以及突击与经常相结合。
    会议经过充分讨论、协商，签订了四省三市除四害讲卫生运动竞赛协议书。协议书要求有关地区从现在起到1960年底止，继续发动群众，再接再厉，进一步降低四害密度，在一切可能的地方基本消灭四害，广泛地进行卫生宣传教育，普及卫生知识，使群众逐步养成良好的卫生习惯；并结合积肥，加强对粪便、垃圾和污水的处理，消灭蚊蝇孳生场所，搞好环境卫生；同时，还要搞好饮食行业、集体福利事业、厂矿工地的卫生；做好恶性传染病的防治工作，减少发病率，降低病死率；积极开展寄生虫病和地方病的防治工作。会议确定今年8月底和9月上旬，四省三市要组织一次卫生参观检查。
