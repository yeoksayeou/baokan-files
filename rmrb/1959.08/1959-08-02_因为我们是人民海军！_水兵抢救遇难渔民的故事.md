"Because We Are the People's Navy!"
    A Story of Sailors Rescuing Fishermen in Distress
    Wu Wangen, Wang Yanwu

    Dark clouds gathered from all directions, and a gale suddenly howled across the sea, with white waves surging.

    At this time, hundreds of fishing boats were busily fishing in the Langgang fishing ground, far from the shelter of Shengshan port. The fishing ground command issued an emergency order: all boats return immediately!

    To rescue the fishing boats in distress, the heroic People's Liberation Army ship 826 set off in the storm, rushing straight to the Langgang fishing ground like an arrow.

    The Langgang fishing ground is located at the easternmost end of the motherland's territorial waters. The currents of the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River meet here. Even when there is no wind, there are wave crests here as high as small mountains. Now, the wind force has reached level eight or higher, and huge waves are crashing onto the ship one after another. The warship was rolling irregularly back and forth, left and right, the degree of tilting having increased to 49 degrees, exceeding the safety limit by 12 degrees. The sailors still persisted at their posts.

    The captain, with a frown, stared ahead, occasionally picking up binoculars to look into the distance. Suddenly, he spotted three black dots swaying on the sea surface in the southeast direction. He immediately ordered the navigation officer: "Change course 120 degrees." The warship headed straight for the three black dots. Closer and closer. Ah! They were fishing boats! The entire ship erupted with activity, preparing nervously for the rescue operation.

    The warship advanced against the wind and waves. Before long, it approached the fishing boats. Some of the fishermen were unconscious in the cabins, some were submerged in the water, and some were tightly clutching the winches with their eyes closed. The sails of the boats were floating on the sea, the wooden planks were floating on the surface, the fishing nets were torn, and the pot lids were floating alongside the boats...

    The political commissar struggled to come out of the cabin with the sailors, dragging a heavy steel cable in his hands. Above the roaring waves, he shouted firmly: "Comrades, this is a glorious task assigned to us by the Party! We swear to rescue the fishermen and their boats..."

    A fierce battle began.

    The warship pushed against the wind and waves, approaching a fishing boat. A huge wave pushed the warship and the fishing boat apart again. The warship approached the fishing boat again. The fishermen were pale and soaking wet. An old fisherman with a white beard saw the People's Navy coming to rescue them, and tears of excitement streamed down his face. He immediately shouted, "Our saviors have arrived! Long live the People's Liberation Army!" Unexpectedly, a huge wave surged over, throwing the fishing boat several feet high and tossing the old fisherman into the sea. Signal Platoon Leader Xu Jin saw this, immediately turned around, and ran to the political commissar to request, "Political Commissar, please approve my going into the sea!" The political commissar looked at the raging waves, his eyebrows almost twisted together, thinking: "In this turbulent sea, even with good swimming skills, danger is hard to avoid..." But thinking of the image of the old fisherman just now, the political commissar said to Xu Jin with emotion, "Alright, for the sake of the fishermen, go quickly!"

    With the political commissar's words, Xu Jin plunged into the sea, swimming towards the old man. White waves came one after another, rolling over his head and body, making it difficult for him to open his eyes. The bitter seawater made it difficult for him to breathe. But he had a strong belief in his heart: "This is the glorious duty of the People's Navy, we must rescue the fishermen at all costs!" So he used his hands to part the waves and swim forward. At this time, the old man was holding a small piece of wood, slowly swimming. After several struggles, he finally rescued the old man onto the fishing boat. The wind force continued to increase, and the raised white waves seemed to be crashing into the sky. The 826 ship fought from afternoon until midnight, and finally rescued three distressed fishing boats.

    Although the fishing boats were rescued, all the machines on the boats were destroyed by the storm and waves. The old man's boat was especially damaged, the high-pressure pump was leaking oil, and the clutch was out of order... The political commissar rolled up his sleeves, waved his fist, and said to the sailors of the whole ship: "Comrades, we have towed the fishing boats back, this is only the first step. In order not to affect the fishermen's production, we will immediately start repairing the machines on the boats." So everyone dispersed to the various boats to repair the machines. After seven hours of hard fighting, all the machines on the fishing boats were repaired. The masts stood upright again, and the clear engine sounds broke through the darkness before dawn. At dawn, the sailors were all bloodshot, but they smiled at each other when they heard the rumbling of the engines. The old fisherman looked at all this and was so moved that he couldn't say a word. He looked at the blue sea, and the past flashed before his eyes: when he was very young, his father went to Langgang to fish and encountered a hurricane. Suddenly, he heard the sound of an engine, and his father was very happy, thinking that someone must have come to rescue the fishing boat. Little did he know that it was a Kuomintang warship coming to steal fish. His father knelt on the deck and begged, "Officer, please have mercy, the fish are already yours, please take us back!" "Get out of here!" His father was kicked down on the boat. The Kuomintang warship sailed away. Now, the People's Navy braved a level ten storm to rescue the fishing boat and also repaired the machines. Thinking of this, he hurriedly ran to the 826 ship, grabbed the political commissar's hand gratefully, and said, "Comrade, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts!" The political commissar smiled and said to the old man, "Uncle, this is what we should do. Because we are the People's Navy."

    “因为我们是人民海军！”
    水兵抢救遇难渔民的故事
    吴万根　王延武
    黑压压的云块从四面八方涌聚拢来，海面上顿时狂风呼啸，白浪滔滔。
    这时，在远离嵊山避风港的浪岗渔场上，千百条渔船正在紧张地捕鱼。渔场指挥发出紧急命令：所有船只立即返航！
    为了抢救危急中的渔船，英雄的人民解放军八二六舰在暴风中开动了，它像脱弦的箭似地直奔浪岗渔场。
    浪岗渔场在祖国领海的最东端。长江和钱塘江的水流在这里碰头。没有风的时候，这里也有小山似的浪头。现在，风力已达到八级以上，巨大的海浪一个个直向舰上盖过来。军舰在前后、左右不规则地颠簸着，倾斜度已增大到四十九度，超过安全度十二度。水兵们还是坚持在自己的战位上。
    舰长双眉紧锁，凝视着前方，不时拿起望远镜向远处了望。突然，在东南方向的海面上发现有三个黑点在晃动。他马上命令航海班长：“改变航向一百二十度”。军舰直向三个黑点驶去。近了，更近了。啊！是渔船，全舰顿时沸腾起来，紧张地准备着抢救工作。
    军舰顶风踩浪前进。不一会儿，接近了渔船。只见渔船上有的渔民昏倒在船舱里，有的浸在水里，有的紧闭双眼死抱着绞盘。船上的帆在海上飘着，木板都浮在海面上，渔网碎了，锅盖也在船边飘游……。
    政委艰难地带着水兵们从舱里爬出来，手里拖着沉重的钢缆。在澎湃的浪涛声中，他坚定地喊道：“同志们，这是党交给我们的光荣任务！我们誓死要救回渔民、渔船……。”
    一场激烈的战斗开始了。
    军舰顶风压浪，靠近一条渔船。一个巨浪，又把军舰和渔船冲开。军舰又一次接近了渔船。渔民脸色苍白，全身湿透。一个胡子花白的船老大看到人民海军来救他们，兴奋得流出了眼泪，立刻喊着：“我们的救星来了，人民解放军万岁！”不料一个巨浪涌来，渔船被抛上几丈高，把船老大掷进大海里了。信号班长徐进看到这个情形，马上一个转身，跑到政委面前申请道：“政委同志，请批准我下海吧！”政委看着汹涌的波涛，双眉几乎要拧在一起，心里想：“在这波浪滔天的大海里，游泳技术再好，也难免不出危险……”但是想到刚才那个老渔民的形象，政委神情激动地对徐进说：“好吧，为了渔民，你快去！”
    随着政委的话音，徐进纵身跃进了大海，向老大的方向游去。白浪接踵涌来，直往他的头上、身上滚过去，使他睁不开眼。苦涩的海水使他感到不好呼吸。但是他心里有一个坚强的信念：“这是人民海军应尽的光荣职责，誓死要把渔民救起来！”于是他双手分开巨浪向前划去。这时船老大正抱着一块小木板，在慢慢地游动，经过几次挣扎，他终于把老大救上了渔船。风力继续在增大着，掀起的白浪，像要撞到天上去一样。八二六舰从下午一直奋战到半夜，终于救出了三条受难的渔船。
    渔船虽然被救了，但船上的机器全被狂风恶浪摧毁了，老大的船上损伤特别大，高压泵漏油，离合器也失灵了……。政委卷起袖子，挥动拳头，向全舰水兵说：“同志们，我们把渔船拖回来了，这仅仅是第一步。为了不影响渔民的生产，我们马上动手修复船上的机器。”于是大家分散到各船上去修理机器了。经过七个小时的苦战，渔船的机器全部修复了。一条条的桅杆重新矗立起来，清晰的马达声冲破了黎明前的黑暗。天亮了，水兵们个个眼中布满血丝，但是听到了隆隆的马达声，都相视而笑了。船老大看看这一切更是激动得说不出一句话来。他望着蔚蓝色的海面，往事一幕幕地在他面前掠过：还是在他很小的时候，一天，父亲也是到浪岗捕鱼，遇到了飓风。突然听到一阵马达声，他父亲可高兴了，心想一定是救渔船的来了，哪里知道原来是国民党的军舰来抢鱼了。他父亲跪在甲板上哀求：“老总，你们行行好，鱼儿已给你们了，请老总带我们回去！”“滚开！”他父亲被踢倒在船上。国民党军舰开走了。如今，人民海军顶着十级风浪，把渔船救了回来，还修好了机器。他想到这里，赶急跑到八二六舰上感激地拉住政委的手说：“同志，我们从心底里感谢你们！”政委微笑着对船老大说：“老大爷，这是应该的。因为我们是人民海军。”
