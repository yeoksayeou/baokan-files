Recovering the Lost Grain
　　——A Record of the Drought Resistance Struggle in Heqian Management Area, Qianjin Commune, Chuxiong County
　　By Our Correspondent Huang Changlu
    The rainy season on the Yunnan Plateau usually starts in May; this early spring, the Chuxiong Basin had a heavy snowfall unseen for over a decade. Old farmers said, "Frost covers rain, snow covers frost, auspicious snow foretells a bumper year." Everyone thought this year would surely be a year of good weather, but unexpectedly, nature turned contrary. By the time of rice transplanting in early June, not a single drop of rain had fallen. Chuxiong is also a well-known drought-prone basin. The elders still remember clearly the great drought twelve years ago, when not even a single rice seedling was planted in Hexi Township. In that township alone, one hundred and eight families fled the famine, and fifty-one people starved to death. In the few years since liberation, Hexi Township built one hundred and twenty-six small dams. Relying on the water stored in these dams, they managed to plant over three thousand mu of rice this year in spite of the drought. But they could only manage to plant the seedlings, not to protect them. Two thousand mu of the three thousand mu of rice paddies dried up, and five hundred mu of fields near the mountains cracked open with gaps an inch or two wide. Walking to the edge of the fields, the heat was stifling, the rice seedlings were withered, and the mountain crops were also shriveled.

    Faced with this unexpected severe drought, the masses were as anxious as ants on a hot pan. Some demanded drought resistance, but had no good ideas; some had a sense of僥倖 luck: "If it doesn't rain during Lesser Fullness, it should rain during Grain in Ear." There were also a few individuals who believed that drought resistance was a waste of manpower and money, and it would be more effective to slaughter a sheep and offer it to the Azure Dragon on the opposite mountain. The Party branch of the Heqian Management Area resolutely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants who were most eager for drought resistance, patiently persuaded those who relied on the heavens for rain, criticized various negative and pessimistic ideas, and united more than a thousand commune members of the management area to fight against the drought. They erected forty-eight waterwheels along the two banks of the small river and used thirty-two pairs of buckets, day and night, to draw water into the fields for irrigation, twice drying up the river, and irrigating the rice paddies on both sides of the river in rotation five to ten times. Over five hundred mu of upland fields could not use the river water. The men carried luggage and searched for water sources all over the mountains, the women went to fetch water from places a mile or two or even several miles away to irrigate the fields, and the children picked leaves to cover the fields to reduce evaporation. The tobacco seedlings died as soon as they were planted under the scorching sun. They planted them again after they died, and planted them again after they died again, planting them five times before finally saving the seedlings.

    In the battle against drought, the Communist Party members of the Heqian Management Area always stood at the forefront of the struggle. Communist Party member Chen Zhaoxin is the captain of the Zengping Production Team. The drought was particularly severe in this team, and all of the more than eight hundred mu of rice paddies planted had dried up. He remembered that in February this year, the commune members went up the mountain to accumulate green manure. The mountain was steep, and the road was slippery. Many women slipped and fell, their knees were scraped, and they were bleeding, but no one complained; after several months of hard work, they delivered 30,000 jin of fertilizer to each mu of field. They had painstakingly managed from sowing seedlings to transplanting them. Could they watch half of the grain that was about to be harvested be taken away by the drought? Could they let the commune members' hard work be in vain? Absolutely not!

    That night, he returned from the branch meeting, already late into the night. As he walked back to the village, he thought: Saving people from disaster is like putting out a fire. It would be best to take action tomorrow morning. But then he thought of another thing: drought resistance requires tools. There were only three usable waterwheels in their team, and the others were either broken or missing parts. What to do? Thinking of this, he walked three steps in two, and after returning to the village, he did not immediately enter his house, but woke up several carpenters and asked them to repair the five waterwheels overnight. Not caring about the dark and the long distance, he called several young men to go with him to the county town more than ten miles away, and bought two new waterwheels overnight. The next morning, people saw Chen Zhaoxin leading the commune members sitting on the waterwheels, drawing river water into the dry rice paddies.

    It took five waterwheels in a row to bring the river water into the rice paddies. The water did not come easily. Chen Zhaoxin thought that if the field ridges were made thicker, the water could be retained better. So, while drawing water, he sent some commune members to reinforce the field ridges. At first, one person could only reinforce fifty or sixty zhang a day, and it seemed that the task could not be completed as scheduled. Chen Zhaoxin thought, as the saying goes: "To forge iron, one must be strong oneself." If I don't set an example, it won't work to just call for improved work efficiency. The next day, he went to reinforce the field ridges himself. He started work before dawn and worked until dark, reinforcing one hundred and thirty-eight zhang. The commune members began to discuss: "Our team leader is not strong, but he does so much, we should also put in more effort." On the third day, some commune members reinforced one hundred and twenty zhang, and the work efficiency doubled or so.

    After drawing water for more than ten days in a row, many people had blisters on their feet. Sometimes, if they were not careful and their feet slipped, the axles of the waterwheels would hit their legs. In addition, there were a few light, insignificant rains, which numbed people's will to fight drought. Some people had a loose attitude and did not want to continue drought resistance. Chen Zhaoxin's soles were also covered with blood blisters. Several times he wanted to rest, but he understood that if he stopped, the masses would follow, and the drought resistance struggle would not be able to continue. At this most difficult moment, everyone was looking at the Party members! Thinking of this, he simply brought his quilt and put it next to the waterwheel, sleeping there and eating there. The commune members took turns drawing water, but sometimes he refused to change shifts. The commune members were very moved and said: "Our team leader draws water, attends meetings, and works, much more tired than us. He can persevere, how can we bear to leave?" The masses also brought their quilts from home and followed him, eating by the fields and sleeping by the fields.

    The fifteen-mile-long small river was drained by the drought resistance army, and many people despairingly asked Chen Zhaoxin: "Team leader, the river is dry, what about drought resistance?" Chen Zhaoxin firmly replied: "River water and well water can be drained, but people's enthusiasm can never be exhausted!" He walked along the winding small river and saw that there were still small ponds of accumulated water left in the low-lying areas of the riverbed, so he said to everyone: "Isn't this a solution!" He and Party member Wu Yonggui gathered ten people with buckets and washbasins to chase the accumulated water at the bottom of the river downstream in sequence. After gathering it in one place, they used waterwheels to send it to the fields. The masses called this newly created drought resistance method "chasing the river."

    Relying on everyone's enthusiasm, after resisting the drought for two months, this management area saved three thousand mu of rice, and not a single seedling died from the drought. The corn grew even better than last year. The masses said: Without the leadership of the Communist Party, if we encountered this kind of year, bones would pile up like mountains. Now the struggle here has not ended, and people are looking for various ways to recover the grain lost due to the drought.

　　夺回损失的粮食
　　——记楚雄县前进公社河前管理区的抗旱斗争
　　本报记者　黄昌禄
    云南高原的雨季一般从5月就开始；今年初春，楚雄坝子又下了一场十多年来难逢的大雪。老农说：“霜盖雨，雪盖霜，瑞雪兆丰年。”大家都以为今年准是风调雨顺的好年成，没料到老天爷的性子反了常，到6月初栽秧时，还没有飘半点雨星子。楚雄又是有名的干旱坝子，老人还记得清楚，十二年前遭过一场大旱，河西乡连一棵秧苗也没有栽下，单这个乡，就有一百零八家逃了荒，活活饿死了五十一个人。解放几年来，河西乡修了一百二十六座小坝塘，靠这些坝塘的蓄水，今年抗旱栽下了三千余亩水稻。顾了栽秧，顾不得保苗，三千亩稻田就干了两千亩，有五百亩挨山的田裂开了一两寸宽的大口。走到田边，热气熏人，秧苗枯黄了，山地作物也卷缩着叶子。
    在这事先未曾料到的严重干旱面前，群众急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。有的要求抗旱，但却没有好主意；有些人存在着侥幸心理：“小满不下雨，芒种该会下。”也有个别人认为抗旱劳民伤财，不如杀只羊去祭祭对面山上的青龙更有效。河前管理区的党支部坚决依靠那些要求抗旱最迫切的贫农和下中农，耐心说服了靠天下雨的人，批判了各种消极悲观思想，团结了管理区的一千多社员向干旱展开了搏斗。他们在小河两岸架起了四十八张水车，并用三十二对水桶，日夜不停的往田里车水灌溉，两度车干了河水，把小河两岸的稻田轮番灌溉了五次至十次。有五百多亩山田无法利用河水，男人们背起行李遍山寻找水源，妇女们到一两里甚至几里路以外去挑水来浇灌田地，儿童们都去采摘树叶来盖在田里，减少水分蒸发。烤烟苗刚栽下就被烈日晒死，死了再栽，再死又再栽，一直栽了五次才保住苗。
    在抗旱的战斗中，河前管理区的共产党员始终站在斗争的最前列。共产党员陈朝信是增平生产队的队长，这个队旱得特别厉害，栽下的八百多亩水田，全部干涸了。他想起今年2月间社员上山积绿肥，山又陡，路又滑，好些妇女滑跌了跤，膝盖上碰破了皮，流着血，没有人叫一声苦；经过几个月苦干，给每亩田送下三万斤肥料，好容易从撒秧到把秧栽下，能够眼看着到手一半的粮食被干旱夺走吗？能够让社员白白辛苦一场吗？坚决不能！
    这一夜，他参加了支部大会回来，已经夜半三更了。他边回村边想：救灾如救火，最好明天早上就行动。可是他又想起另外一件事来，抗旱需要工具。他们队里只有三张水车能用，其他的几张不是破了，就是缺这缺哪，怎么办？想到这里，他三步当做两步走，回村后没有马上走进家门，却去叫醒了几个木匠，请他们连夜把五张水车修好。也顾不得天黑路远，他又叫了几个小伙子跟他到十多里外的县城里去，连夜买回了两架新水车。第二天早晨，人们看见陈朝信带着社员坐在水车上，把河水车进了干涸的稻田。
    接连五张水车才能把河水引进稻田，水，来得可不容易。陈朝信想，如果把田埂糊得更厚实些，可以把水保得更好。于是，在车水的同时，他又派了一部分社员去糊田埂。开始一人一天只能糊五、六十丈长，眼看任务不能如期完成。陈朝信想到，常言说：“打铁要靠本身硬”我不作出个样子，光叫提高工效也不行。第二天，他自己去糊田埂。天蒙蒙亮就出工，干到天黑，糊了一百三十八丈长。社员们议论开了：“我们队长的劳动力不强，他都干这样多，我们也该加把劲。”第三天，有的社员糊了一百二十丈，工效提高了一倍左右。
    一连车了十多天水，好多人的脚底磨起了泡。有时不小心脚一滑，水车的轴轳便打着腿。加上这时下了几场不痒不疼的小雨，麻痹了人们的抗旱斗志。有些人产生了松劲情绪，不想再继续抗旱了。陈朝信的脚板上也磨满了血泡，好几次他想歇下来休息休息，但他明白，如果他下来，群众就会跟着下来，抗旱斗争就坚持不下去。在这最艰苦的时刻，人人都在望着党员呵！想到这里，他便索性把被盖抱来放在水车旁边，睡在那里，吃在那里。社员们轮班车水，他有时却不肯换班，社员们十分感动地说：“我们队长又车水，又开会，又工作，比我们累得多，他都能坚持，我们能忍心走开吗？”群众也纷纷把被盖从家里抱来，跟着他吃在田边，睡在田边。
    十五里长的小河被抗旱大军车干了，好多人绝望地问陈朝信：“队长，河水干了，抗旱怎么办？”陈朝信坚定地回答说：“河水井水车得干，人的干劲使不完！”他沿着这条曲折的小河走去，看见河底的低凹处，还剩下一小塘一小塘的积水，便向大家说：“这不是有了办法了吗！”他同党员吴永贵约了十个人带着水桶和洗脸盆，把河底的积水，顺次往下游赶，赶到一处集中后，再用水车往田里送。群众把这种新创造的抗旱方法叫做“赶河”。
    靠着大家这股干劲，抗了两个月的旱，这个管理区保住了三千亩水稻，没有一棵苗旱死。包谷长得比去年还好。群众说：没有共产党领导，碰到今年这种年成，骨头都会堆成山。现在这里的斗争还没有结束，人们正在找各种门路，决心把受旱损失的粮食拿回来。
