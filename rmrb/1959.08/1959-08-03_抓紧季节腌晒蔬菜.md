Seize the Season to Pickle and Sun-Dry Vegetables

Summer is the peak season for vegetables. Especially this year, various places have developed vegetable production, and the market supply is large, the varieties are many, and the prices are also cheap. All collective catering units and residents can take advantage of this season to process some dried, pickled, brined, and preserved vegetables for consumption in the coming winter and spring. Now, let me introduce several simple methods for processing vegetables.

Sun-Dried Vegetables

	Sun-Dried Zucchini and Pumpkin: Zucchini and pumpkins, old or young, are both suitable. When processing, first wash them with clean water, cut them open with a knife, remove the seeds, and cut them into slices, strips, or shreds. They can be sun-dried or oven-dried. For older ones, the skin can be peeled off.

	Sun-Dried Eggplant: Wash the eggplants with clean water, cut them into slices about two or three millimeters thick, and sun-dry or oven-dry them. When eating, soak them in water, squeeze out the water, then chop them up. They are good for stir-frying, making soup, or even better for stuffing.

	Sun-Dried Green Beans: Old or young green beans are both suitable (bad ones are not). Remove the strings, blanch them in boiling water, and then take them out and sun-dry. To maintain the green pigment, you can add some baking soda when blanching. Dry them in a shaded area, and they can be stored for two or three years. When eating, boil them in boiling water and they will be the same as fresh ones. They are delicious for stir-frying, stewing, and best for cold dishes.

	Sun-Dried Green Peppers: Choose thick green peppers, cut them into a spoon shape to remove the seeds, and heat them in 5% pure alkali water to 90 to 100 degrees Celsius, soak them for three to four minutes, and then dry them. If using sunlight, build a shade. Green pepper dried in this way is light green and has less spicy flavor. Soak in warm water for a few hours before eating to return to its original shape, take it out and let it dry for half an hour, and it can be used for stir-frying.

Pickled Vegetables

	Pickled Eggplant: Choose good quality eggplants, wash them with clean water, cut them into slices half a centimeter thick, and steam them in a wooden cage until they are half-cooked. Let them cool before putting them in a vat. When putting them in the vat, alternate layers of eggplant slices, leeks, and salt. After seven days, add some more salt and ingredients. Use 15 kilograms of salt, 10 kilograms of leeks, and 20 kilograms of clean water per 100 kilograms of eggplant.

Fermented Vegetables

	Any leafy vegetable can be pickled. Generally, mustard greens, fennel white leaves, and radish leaves are used. When processing, shred the mustard green heads, chop the leaves or cabbage leaves, boil them in boiling water, take them out, wrap them in a cloth, and press out the water with a sieve, then put them into the vat, pressing each layer firmly. Press down with a stone, pour in boiling water or rice water to submerge the vegetables. After five or six days, take them out and they can be eaten. They can be stir-fried or cold mixed.

Making Preserved Vegetables

	Preserved Celtuce with Skin: Remove the head and tail of the celtuce, soak it in clean water overnight, take it out and let it dry, and place it in the sauce used to preserve vegetables. After ten days, take it out and preserve it in another vat of sauce. Use 28 kilograms of sweet soybean paste and 12 kilograms of yellow soybean paste per 100 kilograms. After fifteen days, transfer it to another vat for preservation, using 21 kilograms of sweet soybean paste and 9 kilograms of yellow soybean paste per 100 kilograms. It will be ready after another fifteen days. During the entire preserving process, it must be turned over and dried twice a day.

	Tomato Juice: Choose ripe, red tomatoes, wash them, boil them for ten minutes, take them out and stir them open, then filter them with horsehair gauze to remove seeds and skins, add 2% salt, and then boil them in a pot for 20 minutes before bottling. After bottling, seal them while hot at a temperature not lower than 80 degrees Celsius, then boil the bottles for 30 minutes to sterilize them. Cool them slightly and then put them in cold water to cool completely before storing.

	Tomato Sauce: Tomatoes can also be processed into tomato broad bean paste. Use 15 kilograms of salt, 33 kilograms of moldy beans, and 5 kilograms of fresh ginger paste per 100 kilograms of tomato juice, and sun-dry for 100 days.

	Pumpkin Chili Sauce: First, cut the pumpkin open, remove the seeds and pulp, remove the skin, cut into thin slices, boil until soft, and mash into pumpkin puree, then cool and dry to remove moisture until it becomes a paste. Mix 2 kilograms of red chili powder, 12 kilograms of salt, 1.5 taels of benzoin, and 4 taels of ground Sichuan peppercorns per 100 kilograms of pumpkin puree. Mix well to make a delicious pumpkin chili sauce.

	Pumpkin Sweet Sauce: After boiling the pumpkin until soft and mashing it into puree, dry it to remove moisture. Mix 20 kilograms of sucrose or 4 qian of saccharin, 5 kilograms of salt, 1.5 taels of benzoin preservative, and 5 kilograms of soy sauce color per 100 kilograms. Soy sauce color can be made by squeezing and boiling fresh radishes to make a syrup substitute.

	Pumpkin Fruit Jam: After boiling the pumpkin until soft and mashing it into puree, dry it to remove moisture. Add 1 liang of saccharin, 1.5 taels of benzoin preservative, 1 jin of fruit powder, and 2-3 qian of fruit essence per 100 kilograms. Mix well and it is ready.

    抓紧季节腌晒蔬菜
    夏天是蔬菜上市的旺季。尤其是今年，各地都发展了蔬菜生产，目前蔬菜上市量大品种多，价钱也便宜。各个集体伙食单位和居民，都可以乘这个季节，加工一些干、酸、腌、酱菜，以供今冬明春食用。现在，给大家介绍几种简单的蔬菜加工办法。
    晒菜干
    西胡芦南瓜干　西胡芦、南瓜老嫩都行。加工的时候，先用清水洗净，用刀切开挖掉瓤籽，切成片片或旋成丝、条，晒干或烘干都可。过老的可把皮削去。
    茄　子　干　将茄子用清水洗净，切成约二、三分厚的片片晒干，或烘干。吃时用水泡开，把水挤一下，然后切碎，炒菜、熬汤都很好，包馅吃更好。
    豆　角　干　老嫩豆角都行
  （坏的不行），去筋，用开水过一下，捞出来晒干。为保持绿色素，在过水时可加些苏打，在蔽阴处晾干，可以存二、三年。吃用的时候，用开水煮一下捞出来和鲜的一样，炒菜、炖菜都好吃，拌冷菜最好。
    青　辣　干　选肥厚的青辣，割成瓢状去籽，用5％的纯碱水加热到摄氏九十度至一百度，浸泡三、四分钟，然后烘干，如利用日光晒应搭凉棚。这样制成的青辣干是淡绿色，辛辣味较小。吃前用温水浸泡几小时变成原状，捞出晾半小时，就可用来炒菜。
    腌　咸　菜
    咸茄子　选质量较好的茄子，用清水洗净，切成五分厚的片片，放在木笼内蒸到五成熟，下笼凉后再下缸。下缸时一层茄片一层韭菜一层盐。经过七天以后再添些盐和配料，每百斤茄子用十五斤盐，十斤韭菜，清水二十斤。
    醱酸菜
    凡是叶菜都可以腌。一般的是用芥菜、茴子白叶和萝卜缨子等。加工的时候，将芥菜头擦成丝丝，把缨子或白菜叶切碎用开水煮过，捞出用布包起来放到筛子内把水压净，然后入缸，一层一层压扎实，用石头压住，倒入开水或者米汤把菜淹住。经过五、六天捞出来就能吃。无论炒吃冷拌都行。
    ·做酱菜·
    带皮酱窝笋把青笋去头尾，在清水中浸一夜捞出来晾干，放在酱过菜的酱中，十天后取出再以另一个缸酱化。每百斤用甜面酱二十八斤，黄豆酱十二斤，十五天后转缸酱化，每百斤用甜面酱二十一斤，黄豆酱九斤，再经过十五天即成。在全部酱制过程中，每天要翻动晒晾两次。
    西红柿汁　选纯熟、色红的西红柿，洗净，煮十分钟取出搅开，再用马尾罗过滤，除去籽粒和皮，加2％的食盐，然后用锅熬煮二十分钟装瓶。装了瓶，在温度不低于摄氏八十度时乘热封口，再连瓶煮沸消毒三十分钟。稍冷后再投入冷水镇凉便可保存。
    西红柿酱　西红柿还可加工成西红柿豆瓣酱。每百斤西红柿汁用盐十五斤，霉豆三十三斤，鲜姜末五斤，日晒百天即成。
    南瓜辣椒酱　先将南瓜剖开，去瓤及籽，除去瓜皮，切成薄片，煮烂捣成瓜泥，然后冷却，晒去水份，使成为浆糊状。每百斤南瓜泥，配入红辣椒末二斤，食盐十二斤，安息香一点五两，花椒末四两。调拌均匀，即成美味可口的南瓜辣酱。
    南瓜甜酱　将南瓜煮烂捣成瓜泥以后，晒去水份，每百斤配入蔗糖二十斤或糖精四钱，食盐五斤，安息香防腐剂一点五两和酱色五斤。酱色可用鲜萝卜榨熬，制成糖稀代替。
    南瓜果子酱　将南瓜煮烂捣成瓜泥以后，晒去水份，每百斤加糖精一两，安息香防腐剂一点五两，果子粉一斤，果子香油精2—3钱，搅拌均匀即成。
