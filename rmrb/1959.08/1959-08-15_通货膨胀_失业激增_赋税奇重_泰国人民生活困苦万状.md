Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Bangkok Dispatch: According to newspaper reports, high prices, rising living costs, and the continuous devaluation of the Thai baht are the serious problems currently facing the Thai people.

    According to official Thai statistics, national commodity prices in Thailand last year rose by 27% compared to 1953.

    In May of this year, the cost of living index rose by more than 66% compared to 1948. The trend of inflation in Thailand is becoming increasingly apparent. The current amount of Thai currency in circulation has reached 6.2 billion baht, an increase of 19% compared to the amount in circulation in 1955.

    Thai newspapers say that farmers, who account for about 80% of the country's population, live in distress under the cruel exploitation of landlords and usurers. Their incomes are low and they are heavily indebted. Interest rates on loans in Thailand are usually between 10% and 20% per month.

    The "Siam Masses Daily" pointed out that about 85% of farmers do not have surplus funds to purchase necessities.

    Famine also occurs frequently in some areas, and many farmers are in a state of semi-starvation. News of selling children and daughters is often heard. Large numbers of young men and women from rural areas flow into the cities and become beggars, coolies, and prostitutes. It is reported that in one county of Lampang Province in the north, more than 5,400 farmers are without food and urgently need relief.

    Urban workers in Thailand have low wages. Generally, their monthly income is only about 300 baht. In addition, in recent years, Thailand's economic situation has become increasingly depressed, resulting in a large number of workers becoming unemployed, which has made their lives even more desperate.

    The lives of low-level government civil servants are also very difficult. According to newspaper reports, the annual salary income of low-level civil servants in Thailand is a total of 5,400 baht, but their annual expenditure is 6,300 baht.

    The lives of general teachers in Thailand are even more difficult. According to recent newspaper revelations, more than 80% of teachers in Thai public schools rely on borrowing to make a living.

    Despite the increasing poverty of the people, they still have to bear heavy taxes. According to newspaper statistics, the average Thai person pays about 300 baht in taxes each year.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 14th, Bangkok Dispatch: Thailand's foreign trade continues to have a deficit. According to statistics released by the Thai Customs Department on the 10th, Thailand's foreign trade deficit in the first quarter of this year reached more than 109 million baht.

    The total value of imports for this quarter was 1,946,770,000 baht, and the total value of exports was 1,845,788,000 baht.

　　通货膨胀　失业激增　赋税奇重
　　泰国人民生活困苦万状
    新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：据报纸报道，物价高涨，生活费用上升和泰币不断贬值，是泰国人民目前面临的严重问题。
    据泰国官方发表的统计，去年泰国全国物价比1953年上涨了27％。
    今年5月生活指数比1948年上升了66％多。泰国通货膨胀的趋势越来越明显，目前泰国货币的发行额已达六十二亿铢，比1955年的发行额增加了19％。
    泰国报纸说，占全国人口约80％的农民在地主和高利贷者的残酷剥削下生活陷入困境。他们收入低微，负债累累。泰国借债的利息，通常是月利10％到20％之间。
  “暹罗群众报”指出，约有85％的农民没有余款购买生活必需品。
    有些地区还经常发生饥荒，不少农民处在半饥饿状态，卖儿贩女的消息时有所闻。大批的农村青年男女流入城市沦为乞丐、苦力和妓女。据报道，目前北部喃邦府的一个县就有五千四百多个农民没有粮食，急待救济。
    泰国城市工人工资低微。普遍每月收入只有三百铢左右。加上近几年来，泰国经济情况日益萧条，造成了大批工人失业，使他们的生活更加陷入了绝境。
    政府低级公务人员的生活也很窘迫。据报纸报道，泰国的低级公务员每年的工资收入共计五千四百铢，但是每年的开支却要六千三百铢。
    泰国一般教员的生活更是困苦。据报纸最近透露，泰国平民学校的教员80％以上是靠借债度日的。
    尽管人民的生活日益贫困，但是他们仍然必须负担繁重的捐税。据报纸统计，泰国每人平均每年要纳税约三百铢。
    据新华社14日讯　曼谷消息：泰国对外贸易继续入超。据泰国海关厅10日发表的统计数字表明，今年第一季度泰国对外贸易的赤字达一亿零九十多万铢。
    这个季度的入口总值为十九亿四千六百七十万铢，出口总值为十八亿四千五百七十八万铢。
