Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 18th: Party committees in Jiangsu Province are adopting the method of "grasping both ends to lead the middle" to summarize and promote the experiences of many advanced agricultural middle schools. At the same time, they are conscientiously helping some poorly run agricultural middle schools to rectify and consolidate, so that the agricultural middle schools throughout the province are gradually consolidated, and the teaching quality is continuously improved.

Over the past year, under the care and leadership of party committees at all levels and the active support of the masses, agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have been basically consolidated. In the second half of this year, the province's thousands of agricultural middle schools will enroll another 200,000 new students. However, the development of agricultural middle schools in the province is uneven. In some areas, due to the insufficient understanding of the nature and significance of agricultural middle schools by some cadres, the leadership over agricultural middle schools has been relaxed, and the difficulties existing in agricultural middle schools have not been resolved in time, so that agricultural middle schools have not achieved the due results. In order to achieve a universal improvement of agricultural middle schools throughout the province on the basis of consolidation, in early July, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China required party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over agricultural middle schools, rely on the masses, and effectively solve the difficulties of poorly run agricultural middle schools, and help them improve. According to the spirit of the Provincial Committee, party committees at all levels immediately took measures. Sun Zhenhua, First Secretary of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally convened a meeting of the secretaries of county (city) committees in charge of culture and education to specifically discuss how to run agricultural middle schools well. After the meeting, an inspection team was organized to check the situation of agricultural middle schools in various places and help solve difficult problems. The Jinshan People's Commune in Zhenjiang allocated ten houses for the Pioneer Agricultural Middle School, which lacked housing, and decided to help the agricultural middle school add some agricultural tools, and made proper arrangements for the students' living problems. Some production brigades also sent experienced old peasants to the school to serve as production instructors. In order to strengthen the leadership over agricultural middle schools, the commune also established a school affairs committee composed of the first secretary of the commune party committee, the head of the commune, the head of the propaganda section, and the party branch secretaries of various production brigades. The head of the commune also serves as the principal of the agricultural middle school, regularly inspects teaching work, and helps the school solve difficult problems in a timely manner.

After rectification, the enthusiasm of teachers and students in some agricultural middle schools that were previously poorly run has rapidly increased, and teaching and production labor have begun to get on the right track.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 18th: While developing and consolidating agricultural middle schools, the Jiangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has taken a series of effective measures to improve the teaching quality of agricultural middle schools.

Jiangshan County originally had twenty-three agricultural middle schools with one thousand students. Generally, all schools adhered to the system of combining education with productive labor. The vast majority of schools completed the planned teaching plan, and the students' learning quality basically met the requirements. However, a few schools had insufficient teaching staff, and the teaching quality could not be significantly improved. In response to this situation, the Jiangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently strengthened its leadership over agricultural middle schools to help agricultural middle schools at all levels generally improve teaching quality.

The Jiangshan County Committee of the Communist Party of China first merged the original twenty-three agricultural middle schools into ten according to regional characteristics and conditions, in order to concentrate and adjust the teaching force. At the same time, agricultural technical instructors were assigned to each agricultural middle school; teacher training for agricultural middle schools was organized.

Secondly, the curriculum of agricultural middle schools was adjusted. It is stipulated that cultural courses include Chinese, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, physics, and chemistry; the teaching content of agricultural knowledge and technology includes animals, plants, soil, fertilizers, crop cultivation, pest control, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, agricultural machinery, etc., and each school can make appropriate adjustments according to local needs. The arrangement of study and labor time stipulates that each accounts for 50%, and the school is given a labor base. Finally, some agricultural middle schools were helped to solve problems such as improper study arrangements and untimely supply of textbooks in the past. Now, all agricultural middle schools are actively carrying out school relocation and enrollment work, and teachers and students of all schools have great confidence in further improving agricultural middle schools.

　　党委加强领导　教学质量提高
　　江苏各地推广先进农业中学经验
　  浙江江山组织教师进修调整课程
    新华社南京18日电　江苏省各地党委采取“抓两头带中间”的办法，在总结推广许多先进农业中学经验的同时，认真帮助一些办得较差的农业中学进行整顿，使全省农业中学逐步巩固下来，教学质量得到不断提高。
    一年多来，江苏省农业中学在各级党委的关怀领导和群众的积极支持下，已基本上巩固下来。今年下半年，全省的几千所农业中学，还将招收二十万名新生。但是，全省农业中学发展不平衡。有的地区由于部分干部对农业中学性质、意义认识不足，放松了对农业中学的领导，对农业中学存在的困难没有及时解决，使农业中学没有取得应有的成绩。为了达到全省农业中学在巩固的基础上普遍提高一步，7月初，中共江苏省委要求各级党委加强对农业中学的领导，依靠群众，切实解决办得较差的农业中学的困难问题，帮助它们提高一步。根据省委的精神，各级党委立即采取了措施。中共淮阴地委第一书记孙振华，曾经亲自召开各县（市）委管文教的书记会议，具体讨论办好农业中学的问题。会后，又组织检查组，检查各地农业中学的情况和帮助解决困难问题。镇江金山人民公社拨出十间房子给缺少房子的先锋农业中学使用，还决定帮助农业中学添置一些农具，对学生生活问题，也作了妥善安排。有的生产大队还派出有经验的老农民到学校担任生产指导。为了加强对农业中学的领导，公社还成立了由公社党委第一书记、社长、宣传科长和各个生产大队党支部书记组成的校务委员会，公社社长兼农业中学校长，定期检查教学工作，及时帮助学校解决困难问题。
    一些原先办得较差的农业中学经过整顿后，师生的积极性迅速提高，教学和生产劳动开始走上正轨。
    新华社杭州18日电　中共浙江省江山县委在发展和巩固农业中学的同时，采取一系列有力的措施，提高农业中学的教学质量。
    江山县原有二十三所农业中学、学生一千人。各校一般都坚持了教育与生产劳动相结合的制度，绝大部分学校完成了预计的教学计划，学生学习质量基本上达到要求。但是，有少数学校教师力量不足，教学质量不能显著提高，针对这一情况，中共江山县委最近加强了对农业中学的领导，帮助各级农业中学普遍提高教学质量。
    中共江山县委首先把原有二十三所农业中学根据地区特点和条件合并为十所，以便集中和调整教师力量。同时，为各农业中学配备了农业技术指导员；组织农业中学教师进修。
    其次，调整了农业中学的课程。规定文化课中包括语文、算术、代数、几何、物理、化学；农业知识技术的教学内容有动物、植物、土壤、肥料、作物栽培、病虫害防治、畜牧兽医、农业机械等，各校可以根据当地需要作适当调整。学习和劳动时间的安排，规定各占50％，并给学校以劳动基地。最后，帮助部分农业中学解决了过去学习安排不当、课本供应不及时等问题。现在，各农业中学都在积极进行迁校和招生工作，各校师生对进一步办好农业中学信心很高。（附图片）
