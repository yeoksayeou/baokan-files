Carefully Manage Cotton Fields, Ensure Increased Cotton Production

　　Hubei cotton-producing areas launch an upsurge of field management amidst drought resistance, ensuring bolls are retained and striving to set more autumn bolls.
　　Dunhuang County adopts ten measures, conducts segmented competitions with item-by-item evaluation; Siyang County organizes a ten-thousand-person inspection, launching a county-wide overproduction competition.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: Hubei Province's cotton-producing areas have launched a high tide of cotton cultivation management in the midst of drought resistance, ensuring that early bolls are retained and striving to produce more autumn bolls.

    Hubei Province's more than eight million mu of cotton fields, like rice paddies, have been threatened by drought since July. Party committees at all levels, while fighting the drought, have also arranged for some labor to water the cotton fields to resist drought and strengthen cotton field management. In the Jingzhou area, 1.8 million mu out of 3.8 million mu of cotton fields have been affected by drought, but after the efforts of more than 300,000 people, more than 1.1 million mu have been irrigated with water or watered with manure. Some people in some areas believe that cotton is a hardy crop and does not need drought resistance to ensure a good harvest. The local Party organizations immediately mobilized the masses to discuss whether or not cotton fields should be drought resistant, and also conducted comparative experiments to convince the masses with facts. The Party branch of the Shijian Production Team of the Xiulin Commune in Shishou County conducted a comparative experiment on drought resistance and non-drought resistance in a cotton field. Three days later, the watered cotton plants were three inches taller than the non-watered ones, with five more buds and two more bolls. This example quickly boosted the enthusiasm of the commune members for drought resistance. The entire team immediately dispatched more than 40 people and set up ten waterwheels overnight, irrigating 85 mu of cotton fields in one day.

    In strengthening cotton cultivation management, various localities have also carefully summarized and applied the experience of producing more autumn bolls last year. The Center First Production Team of the Duobao Commune in Tianmen County summarized that the main experiences of grabbing autumn bolls last year were to increase the application of autumn boll fertilizer and strengthen the late-stage pest control and deep cultivation and soil preparation in cotton fields. This year, the drought is severe and the late-stage pest damage is also more severe than last year. When formulating cotton field management measures, this team put drought resistance and pest control in the first place, and combined topdressing and deep cultivation with drought resistance. In order to make the fertilizer work quickly, they also adopted the methods of furrow application and hole application, and immediately carried out deep cultivation and mulching to preserve soil moisture after fertilization. After these measures, the cotton plants that were originally affected by drought, pests, and fertilizer deficiency are now growing strong and neatly.

    In order to strive for a large-scale increase in cotton production, various localities have paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of backward areas and the cultivation management of backward fields. After criticizing the idea of valuing nearby fields and neglecting distant fields, and valuing first-class seedlings and neglecting third-class seedlings, the Gonggou Management Area of the Yuhu Commune in Gong'an County organized a special group to cultivate and manage third-class fields. The Renhe Management Area of the Makou Commune in Hanchuan County also organized teams to carry out five major collaborations in terms of funds, fertilizers, tools, water sources, and labor on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, so that the eleven backward small teams in the area changed their appearance, and the backward seedlings were generally upgraded.

    This newspaper, Lanzhou, 12th. The cotton farmers of the Dunhuang County People's Commune, one of the key cotton-producing counties in Gansu Province, are, under the specific leadership of the Party organization, vigorously grasping ten measures with soaring enthusiasm to attack the mid-term management of cotton fields, striving to produce more early bolls, good bolls, and large bolls. The county has organized more than 3,900 cotton planting experts and cotton farming professional teams to determine plots and measures according to the growth of cotton fields, managed by special personnel, promoted small contracting, carried out segmented competitions, and conducted item-by-item evaluations to promote the upgrading of second- and third-class cotton fields.

    The ten mid-term cotton management measures in Dunhuang County are: 1. Inspection: In conjunction with the inspection and preparation for wheat harvesting, the management of cotton fields was inspected, and problems existing in labor organization were discovered in a timely manner. Immediate research and solutions were carried out, part of the labor force was organized to strengthen the cotton field management team, and a blitz of deep cultivation and weeding activities was launched. 2. Transfer of Labor: About 1,900 people were drawn from agencies and other units to support cotton field management. The Party Secretary took the lead, and the labor force was divided into teams, led by special personnel, and contracted by zones. 3. Consultation: A consultation meeting combining old farmers, cadres, and technicians was organized to diagnose problems in the fields and study measures to increase production. 4. Weeding: Cotton fields throughout the county are diligently weeding, and weeds have been generally weeded once, of which more than 60,000 mu have been weeded twice, and more than 8,000 mu have been weeded three times. Some production teams are now starting to weed four times. 5. Deep Cultivation: Early deep cultivation, frequent deep cultivation, and deep deep cultivation. Currently, deep cultivation has been carried out on 32.7% of the cotton fields. 6. Irrigation: The county adopts a centralized water delivery method, strengthening the connection between upstream and downstream, saving water, and irrigating cotton fields. The first irrigation of cotton fields throughout the county has basically ended, and some are preparing for the second irrigation. 7. Topdressing: In combination with irrigation, more than 25,000 mu of cotton fields have been topdressed with 25 to 35 jin of ammonium sulfate and about 1,000 jin of farm manure per mu. Now, topdressing is continuing in irrigated areas, and those that have been irrigated are preparing for the second topdressing. 8. Pruning: Cotton throughout the county has been topped in a timely manner according to the height of the plants and the number of fruit branches, and pruning work is still being carried out intensively. 9. Boll Protection: This year, the amount of water in Dunhuang is small. The Hexi, Danghe, and Yangjialing brigades, which irrigated early, mobilized and organized commune members to prevent drought and resist drought, and carried out boll protection work. 10. Disease and Pest Control: The early-stage cutworms were controlled with green grass insecticide and basically eradicated. Now, airplanes are being used to control red spiders and cotton aphids on a large scale, and the second control has begun. Because of the tight grip, the harm of diseases and insects has been basically controlled. Thanks to the above measures, the more than 97,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have grown strong and leafy, with cotton plants as high as one foot or more, some with more than ten buds, and some with three to five bolls.

    According to Xinhua Daily News: Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, is grasping the mid- and late-stage management of cotton fields, focusing on pest control and topdressing, based on the county's cotton growth, and striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

    Siyang County planted a total of 200,000 mu of cotton this year. At present, the overall growth is good. The main characteristics are: early development, compact plants, short internodes, and fewer fallen buds, of which 86,000 mu are first-class seedlings, about three feet high, with more than fifteen layers of fruit branches. However, in early and mid-July, many cotton flowers experienced severe loss of vigor, with yellow seedlings, pointed tops, and pest damage in some areas.

    After analyzing the current cotton growth, the county party committee timely put forward the slogan of "focusing on topdressing and pest control, fighting hard for a hundred days, doing a good job in cotton field management, and striving to complete the county's cotton production increase task," and vigorously launched a movement to compete for buds and protect bolls. In terms of topdressing, as of August 6, 180,000 mu of cotton fields in the county had been topdressed, and 80,000 mu of drought-stricken cotton fields were being topdressed with manure fertilizer. In order to completely defeat pests, the 27 communes in the county have strengthened the professional leadership of pest control at all levels. In addition, the county party committee proposed that at the current critical period, the first secretaries of communes and teams with more cotton fields should personally grasp cotton, all cadres should work, work, and meet in the fields, and adopt measures such as setting up pacesetters at all levels, launching red flag competitions, and launching movements to "exceed contracted production with actual production and exceed quotas with labor." In order to promote the rapid development of the movement, the county party committee organized a large-scale inspection and promotion by ten thousand people on August 5, and nearly 100,000 people in the county are enthusiastically engaged in this movement.

    增施肥料　适当灌溉　防止涝灾　除灭虫害
    精心管理棉田　确保棉花增产
　　湖北产棉区在抗旱中掀起田间管理高潮，确保伏桃不掉力争多结秋桃
　　敦煌县采取十项措施，分段竞赛项项评比　泗阳县组织万人检查，全县展开超产竞赛
    据新华社武汉讯　湖北省各棉产区在抗旱中掀起了棉花培育管理高潮，确保伏桃不掉，力争多结秋桃。
    湖北省八百多万亩棉田和水稻一样，从7月份以来就遭受干旱威胁，各级党委在抗旱中，也安排了部分劳力给棉田浇水抗旱，加强棉田管理。荆州专区三百八十多万亩棉田有一百八十万亩受旱，但经过三十多万人的奋战，已有一百一十多万亩灌了水或浇了水粪。有些地区的群众认为棉花是铁庄稼，不要抗旱一样能保丰收，当地的党组织就立即发动群众讨论棉田要不要抗旱的问题，同时还作了对比试验，用事实说服了群众。石首县绣林公社石建生产队党支部，在一块棉田里作了抗旱和不抗旱的对比试验，三天后，浇过水的棉株，比不浇水的高三寸，多现五个蕾和多结两个桃。通过这一事例，迅速鼓起了社员们的抗旱劲头。全队立即出动了四十多人，连夜架起十部水车，一天就浇棉田八十五亩。
    在加强棉花培育管理中，各地还认真总结、运用了去年多结秋桃的经验。天门县多宝公社中心第一生产队，总结去年抓秋桃的经验主要是增施秋桃肥，加强棉田后期治虫和中耕培土。今年旱象严重，后期虫害也比去年厉害些，这个队在制订棉田管理措施时，就把抗旱、治虫放在首位，追肥、中耕松土结合抗旱进行。为使肥料迅速发挥作用，他们还采取了沟施和穴施的办法，并且在施肥后马上中耕松土和盖肥保墒。经过这些措施，原来受旱、受虫害和脱肥的棉株，现在都长得又壮又整齐。
    为争取棉花大面积增产，各地特别注意加强后进地区的领导和落后田的培育管理。公安县玉湖公社宫沟管理区批判了重近田、轻远田，重一类苗、轻三类苗的思想后，组织了专门小组培育管理三类田。汉川县马口公社人和管理区还组织队与队在自愿互利的基础上，开展资金、肥料、工具、水源、劳力五大协作，使全区十一个落后小队改变了面貌，落后苗普遍升了级。
    本报兰州12日电　甘肃省植棉重点县之一——敦煌县人民公社的棉农们，在党组织的具体领导下，正以冲天干劲大抓十项措施，猛攻棉田中期管理，力争多结伏桃、结好桃、结大桃。全县组织了植棉能手和务棉专业队三千九百多人，按棉田生长情况，定地块定措施，由专人管理，推行小包工，分段开展竞赛，项项进行评比，促使二、三类棉田升级。
    敦煌县中期棉花管理的十项措施是：一、检查：结合检查收麦准备工作，就对棉田管理情况作了检查，及时发现了劳力组织等方面存在的一些问题，立即研究解决，组织部分劳力，加强棉田管理队伍，开展了突击中耕除草活动。二、抽调劳力：从机关等方面抽出约一千九百多人，支援棉田管理。党委书记挂帅，劳力分路分方，专人带领，分片包干。三、会诊：组织了一次老农、干部、技术员三结合的会议，在田头会诊，研究增产措施。四、锄草：全县棉田勤锄杂草，已普遍锄草一次，其中有六万多亩已锄了二遍草，有八千多亩已除了三次，部分生产队现在开始锄四次草。五、中耕：早中耕，勤中耕，深中耕。现在经过中耕的已占棉田的32.7％。六、灌溉：全县采取集中输灌办法，上下游加强了联系，节约用水，灌溉棉田。全县棉田第一次灌水已基本结束，有的已准备第二次灌溉。七、追肥：结合灌水，已有二万五千多亩棉田每亩分别追施了二十五斤至三十五斤硫酸铵，一千斤左右农家肥。现在，灌水地区正继续追施，已灌的地区，正准备第二次追肥。八、整株：全县棉花按植株高低、果枝多少适时打了顶，现在还继续突击进行整枝工作。九、保铃：今年敦煌水量少，早灌的河西、党河、杨家柠等大队，动员组织社员群众，防旱抗旱，进行保铃工作。十、灭病虫：早期发生的地老虎，用青草毒杀虫剂防治，已基本扑灭，现在正用飞机大面积防治红蜘蛛、棉蚜，目前已开始第二次防治。由于抓得紧，基本上控制了病虫危害。全县九万七千多亩棉田，由于抓紧上述措施，已长得株壮叶茂，棉株高达一尺以上，有的已现蕾十个以上，有的已成铃三至五个。
    据新华日报消息　江苏省泗阳县正根据全县棉花生长情况，抓紧以治虫、追肥为中心的棉田中后期管理，力争今年棉花大丰收。
    泗阳县今年共种二十万亩棉花，目前普遍生长良好，主要特点是：发育早、植株紧凑、节间短、落蕾较少，其中八万六千亩一类苗，株高三尺左右，果枝十五层以上。但是7月上中旬，不少棉花曾出现严重的脱力现象，苗黄、头尖，且部分地方发生虫害。
    县委分析目前棉花长势后，及时提出了“以追肥、治虫为中心，大战一百天，搞好棉花田间管理，为完成全县棉花增产任务而奋斗”的口号，大鼓干劲，轰轰烈烈地开展了争蕾保桃运动。追肥方面，至8月6日止，全县已有十八万亩棉田追了肥，八万亩受旱棉田正在追施水粪肥。为了彻底战胜虫害，目前全县二十七个公社已层层加强了治虫专业领导。此外，县委提出了在当前关键时期，棉田较多的社、队第一书记应该亲手抓棉花，所有干部实行劳动、工作、开会到田，并采取层层树标兵，开展红旗竞赛，开展“实产超包产、劳动超定额”运动。为了促进运动的迅速开展，县委已于8月5日组织了万人大检查、大促进，全县近十万人正热烈投入到这一运动中来。（附图片）
