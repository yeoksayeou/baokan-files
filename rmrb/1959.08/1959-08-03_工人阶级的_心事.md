    The "Worries" of the Working Class
    Gan Feng

    Every living person has their worries. Through a person's worries, like through a pure crystal, one can clearly see their thoughts and qualities.

    The People's Daily on July 12th carried a news report, "Where Did the 30,000 Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity Come From?" It was about the Shenyang Cable Factory. Last winter, Northeast China experienced a severe drought, and the huge turbines of the Fengman Hydropower Station could not turn. The cable factory, which relied on the national power grid, was facing the prospect of its production being affected. "Where will the electricity come from?" became a worry for all the workers in the factory. Under the leadership of the factory Party committee, a campaign to generate electricity was quickly launched throughout the factory. An old worker and veteran Party member, Xu Xichang, was particularly concerned, feeling as if a heavy stone was pressing on his heart all day long. One morning, instead of going to the office, he stood staring blankly at the gas emitted from the gas station, thinking of using the surplus waste gas to replace electricity. After numerous experiments and overcoming various difficulties, he finally succeeded, saving electricity equivalent to a 2,000-kilowatt power station every day, enabling the cable factory to complete its national plan for last year and the first five months of this year ahead of schedule despite the power shortage.

    This is just one of countless moving examples in the ranks of the working class. A person with a high degree of revolutionary consciousness thinks about the revolutionary cause of the working class. Their hearts are open and honest, without personal worries or gains and losses, rejoicing in the joy of the working people and worrying about their sorrows. Their worries are a reflection of the proletarian revolutionary struggle in their hearts, like a mirror. As long as you see the proletarian revolutionary cause, as long as you see the production struggles they face, you see their hearts. When encountering difficulties in production, their hearts feel "as if a heavy stone was pressing on them," and they work tirelessly to fight the difficulties, thinking of all possible ways to overcome them. When the difficulties are overcome, their hearts rejoice with the rapid rotation and singing of the machines. What a great heart this is! It is this heart that radiates courage and wisdom from the ordinary bodies of so many good sons and daughters of the proletariat.

    For some of us intellectuals, our worries are much more complicated. Personal gains and losses, personal fame and fortune, personal prestige occupy a considerable amount of space in our minds. Compared with the open and selfless worries of the working class, these seem so insignificant! To learn from the working class, we must first learn their concern for the revolutionary cause of the working class.

    If we want to truly make continuous progress, we need to train ourselves in many ways. Thinking more about work-related issues and less about personal issues is one way to train ourselves. If we think more about the revolutionary cause, more about work, and more about the struggle for production, then our communist ideology and collectivist ideology will increase, and the individualistic things will be squeezed out more. If we are not concerned about the revolutionary cause but think too much about trivial matters right under our noses, our revolutionary vigor and enthusiasm will decline, and all kinds of individualistic thoughts will raise their heads. In addition to strengthening our study of Marxism-Leninism and caring about the major events of the entire country, we should, after work, often keep one or two important practical work problems or theoretical problems in our minds, and consider these problems whenever we have time. Slowly, we will develop an interest and a habit, and over time, we will feel that it is of great benefit to both our ideological cultivation and our work.

### 工人阶级的“心事”

    工人阶级的“心事”
    敢峰
    每一个活着的人，总有他的心事，透过一个人的心事，就像通过纯净的晶体一样，可以清楚地看见他的思想品质。
    7月12日人民日报上有一篇通讯“三万度电哪里来？”写的是沈阳电缆厂的事情。去年冬天，东北地区严重干旱，丰满水电站巨大的水轮机无法转动了，依靠国家电网供电的电缆厂，生产眼看就要受影响。“电从哪里来”就成了全厂工人们的心事。在厂党委领导下，全厂迅速开展了办电运动。有个老工人、老党员徐锡昌，更是心事重重，心里整天像压着一块石头，沉甸甸的。一天早晨，他没到办公室，却一个人呆呆地望着煤气站放出的煤气出神，想到用剩余的废弃煤气代电力的办法，经过多次的试验，克服各种困难，终于成功了，每天节约的电力相当于一座二千瓩发电能力的电站，使电缆厂在电源不足的情况下提前完成了去年和今年头五个月的国家计划。
    这不过是工人阶级队伍中无数动人事例中的一个。一个有高度革命觉悟的人心里所想的是工人阶级的革命事业，他心胸坦荡，从无个人的忧虑与得失，以劳动人民之乐为乐，以劳动人民之忧为忧。他们的心事就是无产阶级的革命斗争在他们心中的反映，像一面镜子一样，你只要看见了无产阶级的革命事业，你只要看见了他们所面临的生产斗争，你就看见了他们的心。在生产上遇到了困难的时候，他们的心“像压着一块石头，沉甸甸的”，废寝忘食，去和困难斗争，想一切办法来制服它；当困难被制服时，他们的心又随着机器的飞快的旋转和歌唱而高兴起来。这是一颗多么伟大的心啊，正是这颗心在许多无产阶级好儿女的普通躯壳中，放射着勇敢和智慧的光芒。
    对于我们某些知识分子出身的人来说，心事就复杂得多了，什么个人得失、个人名利、个人威信呀，占去思想上的不少地盘，这和工人阶级胸怀坦荡、大公无私的心事比较起来，又显得多么渺小啊！我们要向工人阶级学习，就要首先学习他们这种关心工人阶级革命事业的心。
    我们要想真正得到不断进步，需要从很多方面进行锻炼，多想一些工作上的问题、少考虑一些个人的问题，就是锻炼的方法之一。对革命事业想得多，对工作想得多，对生产斗争想得多，那我们的共产主义思想、集体主义思想就会多一些，个人主义的东西就会被挤得少一些。对革命的事业不关心，而对个人鼻尖下的小事想得多，革命的朝气和热情就要衰退，种种个人主义的思想就要抬头。我们除了加强马列主义学习和关心整个国家的大事以外，工作之余，经常在脑子里装上一、两个重要的实际工作中的问题，或理论上的问题，一有时间就考虑这些问题，慢慢地就会养成一种兴趣和习惯，久而久之，无论在思想修养和工作上，都会感到有很大益处的。
