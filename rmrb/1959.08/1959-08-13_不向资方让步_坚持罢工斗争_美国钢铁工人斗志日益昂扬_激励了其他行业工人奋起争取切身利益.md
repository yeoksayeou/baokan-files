Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th: The great strike of 500,000 American steelworkers has entered its fifth week today.

　　Because American steel monopoly capitalists continue to unreasonably reject workers' demands for wage increases, labor-management negotiations under the auspices of "mediators" appointed by the US government have yielded no results, and the negotiations have stalled.

　　According to the American "Worker's Weekly," the striking steelworkers are in even higher spirits. Far more steelworkers are participating in strike pickets each day than the union had planned. Unions across the United States have also launched efforts to support the striking steelworkers. For example, in Michigan, the State AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers, and many other local unions have passed resolutions supporting the strike. Ford Local 600 called on 36,000 workers at the Rouget plant to support the striking workers with everything they have. A large local union in Baltimore, Maryland, decided to contact all levels of the AFL-CIO to demand full support for the steelworkers and to hold a general strike if the situation requires.

　　The great steelworkers' strike has inspired workers in other industries in the United States to fight for their own economic interests. The strike is tending to spread to other industries. The strike in the copper refining industry is expanding. Miners at Magma Copper Company and Kennecott Copper Corporation have gone on strike. Due to the strike at these two copper mines, US copper production is reduced by about 41,000 tons per month. The International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers announced last week that if their demands for wage increases are rejected by the capitalists, its approximately 45,000 members will strike in the copper, lead, and zinc smelting industries nationwide by August 20. More than 7,600 workers at Mobil Oil Company plants in Indiana are currently on strike to shorten working hours. The International Longshoremen's Association has put forward wage increase demands to shipping companies on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast routes, and 65,000 dockworkers may strike at the end of August when their contracts expire.

　　The American press cannot completely hide the growing impact of the steel strike on the American economy. According to estimates by the American Iron and Steel Institute, total US steel production last week was only 332,000 tons, equivalent to 11.7% of US steel production capacity. Although monopoly capitalists had stockpiled $750 million worth of 3.7 million tons of steel before the start of the steel strike on July 1 to cope with the strike, "Steel Age" magazine admitted that smaller factories have "begun to feel the pinch, and even larger companies that have not been able to store enough of certain types of steel have had to shut down some departments this month." In addition, enterprises closely related to the steel industry, such as railway transportation, automobile transportation, and coal mines, are also being increasingly affected by the steel strike. According to estimates by the Association of American Railroads, the steel strike has reduced the amount of freight transported by US railroads by 150,000 carloads per week.

　　As the American steel strike is about to enter its second month, the American bourgeoisie's mouthpiece, the "New York Times," openly expressed its concern. In an editorial, it said that if the steel strike is extended to two or three months, its consequences "will be extremely serious for the (American) economy." The "New York Times" worried that the extension of the steel strike would expand and perpetuate the current situation in which US steel exports are decreasing and foreign steel imports are increasing, and would halt the rise of the US economy, which has just recovered to the 1957 level.

　　不向资方让步　坚持罢工斗争
　　美国钢铁工人斗志日益昂扬
　　激励了其他行业工人奋起争取切身利益
    据新华社12日讯　纽约消息：美国五十万钢铁工人的大罢工今天已经进入第五周。
    由于美国钢铁垄断资本家继续无理拒绝工人提高工资的要求，在美国政府任命的“调停人”主持下的劳资谈判没有得到任何结果，谈判已经陷入停顿状态。
    据美国“工人周报”报道，罢工的钢铁工人斗志更加昂扬。每天出来参加罢工纠察工作的钢铁工人比工会所计划的要多得多。美国各地工会也展开了支援罢工钢铁工人的工作。例如，在密执安州，州劳联—产联、联合汽车工人工会和其他许多地方工会都通过了支持罢工的决议。福特公司第六百地方工会号召劳基工厂三万六千名工人以他们所有的一切东西支持罢工工人。马里兰州巴尔的摩一个大地方工会决定同劳联—产联的各级机构取得联系，要求全力支持钢铁工人，如果局势需要就举行总罢工。
    钢铁工人的大罢工激励了美国其他行业工人争取切身经济利益的斗争。罢工有扩大到其他行业的趋势。炼铜工业的罢工正在扩大。马格马铜公司和肯奈柯特铜公司的矿工已经举行罢工。由于这两个铜矿的罢工，美国铜的生产每月减少约四万一千吨。美国国际采矿、冶炼工人工会上星期宣布，如果提高工资的要求被资方拒绝的话，它的约四万五千名会员将在8月20日前在全国冶炼铜、铅、锌的工业中举行罢工。印第安纳州美孚油公司各工厂中目前有七千六百多名工人正在为缩短工作时间而举行罢工。美国国际码头工人联合会已向大西洋和墨西哥湾航线各轮船公司提出提高工资要求，六万五千名码头工人可能在8月底合同期满时举行罢工。
    美国报刊无法完全掩饰钢铁大罢工对美国经济愈来愈大的影响。据美国钢铁研究所估计，美国上星期钢铁总产量总共只有三十三万二千吨，等于美国钢铁生产能力的11.7％。尽管垄断资本家在7月1日钢铁大罢工开始以前已经事先囤积了价值七亿五千万美元的三百七十万吨钢铁准备应付罢工，但是“钢铁时代”杂志承认，较小的工厂已经“开始感到紧张，甚至是那些没有能储存足够的某种类型钢材的较大的公司也不得不在这个月停止某些部门的工作。”此外，同钢铁业有密切关系的铁路运输、汽车运输和煤矿等企业也受到钢铁罢工愈来愈大的影响。据美国铁路协会估计，钢铁罢工已使美国铁路每周减少十五万车皮的货运量。
    在美国钢铁大罢工即将进入第二个月的时候，美国资产阶级的喉舌“纽约时报”公开表示忧虑。它在一篇社论中说，假如钢铁罢工延长到两三个月，它的后果“对（美国）经济来说将是极端严重的”。“纽约时报”担心，钢铁罢工的延长会使目前美国钢铁出口减少，外国钢铁进口增加的状况扩大和永久化，并且会使刚刚恢复到1957年水平的美国经济停止上升。
