　　Decorate the Capital Like a Garden
　　Sofia Residents Decide to Contribute 500,000 Labor Days
    The residents of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, are greeting the 15th anniversary of National Day on September 9th with high labor enthusiasm. Under the slogan of "Turn our city into a blooming garden," they are determined to contribute 500,000 labor days this year to turn Sofia's five districts and its four villages into model districts and model villages, to green forty-five schools and twenty-five other locations, and to carry out a series of other voluntary labor activities. So far, more than 180,000 residents have participated in the above-mentioned voluntary labor, paving several kilometers of streets, digging 40,000 meters of street ditches, and planting nearly 20,000 trees. In addition, in order to welcome National Day, the residents of Sofia have collected and handed over to the state 2.15 million kilograms of waste materials, worth 1.88 million leva (Bulgarian currency). The scrap iron they collected can be used to make tracks for 130 tractors, the non-ferrous metals can be used to make vacuum equipment for five sugar factories, and the waste paper can be made into a large amount of cardboard, enough for the Voroshilov factory to package its radios for two years. The citizens also collected 400,000 kilograms of watermelon and cantaloupe seeds, which can be used to produce nearly 100,000 liters of refined oil and 300,000 kilograms of valuable livestock feed—with a total value of 1.5 million leva.

　　把首都打扮得像花园
　　索非亚人民决定献出五十万个劳动日
    保加利亚首都索非亚的居民正以高涨的劳动热情迎接9月9日国庆十五周年。他们在“把我们的城市变为百花盛开的花园”的口号下决心在今年贡献出五十万个劳动日，把索非亚的五个区和属于它的四个村庄变为模范区和模范村，绿化四十五个学校和二十五个其他地段，并进行一系列的其他义务劳动。到目前为止，已有十八万以上的居民参加了上述义务劳动，他们铺设了好几公里的街道，挖了四万米的街渠，栽种了将近两万棵树木。此外，为了迎接国庆，索非亚的居民已经搜集和交给国家二百一十五万公斤的废料，价值一百八十八万列弗（保币）。他们搜集的废铁可以做一百三十台拖拉机用的履带，搜集的有色金属可以做五个制糖厂用的真空设备，而搜集的废纸可以做成大量的纸板，足够伏罗希洛夫工厂包装它生产的收音机两年之用。市民们还搜集了四十万公斤西瓜子和香瓜子，用它们可以生产将近十万公升的精制油和三十万公斤很有价值的牲畜饲料——总值达一百五十万列弗。
