Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The sanitary army of over one million people in the capital, engaged in eliminating mosquitoes and flies, today split into two groups. One group captured and beat them on the spot, while the other rushed to over four hundred reed marshes, puddles, and other "war zones" to directly attack the lairs of mosquitoes and flies, fighting to eliminate the conditions for their breeding.

At five o'clock in the morning, the streets and alleys of the capital announced the start of the battle amidst the sound of gongs, drums, and whistles. Men, women, old, and young picked up nets and soap-covered washbasins to capture mosquitoes hiding under the eaves and beside trees. On the roads, teams wearing straw hats and carrying iron shovels marched in a mighty manner towards the designated "key war zones" to eliminate mosquitoes and flies.

Li Dequan, Minister of Public Health, personally went to the battlefield in areas such as Dongzhimenwai and the Forbidden City this morning to supervise the battle. The district party secretaries and district heads of each district, as well as the heads of various institutions and schools, also personally went to the front lines to command and participate in the battle to eliminate mosquitoes and flies.

In the pit area of ​​Jiuxianqiao in the eastern suburbs, more than 30,000 workers from nearby factories came to fill in the pits and remove weeds. On this "battlefield," there were four train carriages, ten trucks, seven electric vehicles, and a number of horse-drawn carts, tricycles, and handcarts, transporting garbage, weeds, and mud back and forth. On both sides of the moat outside Fuxingmen, the army attacking the lairs of mosquitoes and flies seemed endless. The thousand-person army composed of sixteen government units near Nanlishi Road moved out in four groups to fill in the stinking puddles. Around the Yanjing Paper Mill outside Dongzhimen, a support army from fourteen units, including the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Beijing Pharmaceutical Machinery Institute, came to remove weeds. Some commando teams responsible for filling water pits outside Yongdingmen found maggots and small flies around the pits, so they filled a layer of soil and sprayed a layer of DDT. In the Forbidden City, 2,400 cadres from government offices eliminated all weeds on the 300,000 square meter area in one morning.

The activities to eliminate mosquitoes and flies were also very intense within various government offices, schools, and enterprises today. More than 2,000 cadres and family members from the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Zhongnanhai Administration slapped at every fly they saw. At six o'clock in the morning, they set up fly traps by the river and in the courtyard. Tsinghua University, which used to have poor sanitary conditions, also took practical actions to strive for the upstream today. Under the command of the two party secretaries, thirteen "armies," totaling more than 10,000 people, fought against mosquitoes and flies. The waste piles in the school's affiliated foundry and mechanical processing plant were thoroughly cleaned and tidied up today, so that a large number of hiding mosquitoes lost their lairs. The workers of the Xuanwu District Pickled Vegetable Factory overturned more than 1,000 water vats, sauce jars, and wooden barrels, and scrubbed all the containers and utensils.

Residents of various streets also set up countless fly traps in the courtyards, by the wells, and at the corners of the hutongs today. The 95 residents of Fusui Jing Street, the national health red banner street, set up 130 fly traps, and the residents formed groups to take turns on duty at each fly trap. At dusk, thousands of households lit mosquito-repellent powders, and people continued to attack mosquitoes and flies with various methods that could win.

Today is the first day of the capital's campaign to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. In the next two days, in addition to continuing to slap and further investigate and treat mosquito and fly breeding places, the method of smoking will be used to eliminate mosquitoes and flies in some areas with more mosquitoes and flies in urban areas and suburban areas within the specified time.

    卫生突击战第一回合声势浩大
    首都百万群众两路夹击蚊蝇
    新华社9日讯　首都一百多万灭除蚊蝇的群众卫生大军，今天兵分两路，一路就地捕打，一路奔赴四百多个苇塘、水坑等“战区”，直捣蚊蝇老巢，为消灭蚊蝇的孳生条件而战。
    清晨五时，首都大街小巷在锣鼓和哨笛声中，宣布了战斗的开始。男女老幼拿起了网兜和涂上肥皂的洗脸盆，在屋檐下、树木旁捕捉藏蚊。马路上，戴着草帽、拿着铁锹的队伍浩浩荡荡分别开向划定的“重点战区”去消灭蚊蝇。
    卫生部部长李德全，今天上午到东直门外、故宫等处亲临战场督战。各区区委书记、区长，各机关、学校的负责人，也都亲临前线指挥并参加了灭除蚊蝇的战斗。
    东郊九仙桥一带的坑洼区，有附近工厂的三万多名职工前来填垫坑洼、拔除杂草。在这个“战场”上，有四个火车厢、十部卡车、七部电动车以及一部分马车、三轮车、手推车，往返运送垃圾、杂草和泥土。在复兴门外护城河两岸，猛攻蚊蝇老巢的大军一眼望不到边。南礼士路附近十六个机关单位组成的千人大军，分四路出动，填垫臭水坑。东直门外燕京造纸厂的周围，开来了中国文联、中国科学院应用物理研究所、北京药械所等十四个单位的支援大军，拔除杂草。在永定门外担负填水坑的一些突击队，发现坑的周围有蛆虫和小苍蝇，他们填一层土、打一层滴滴涕。在故宫作战的二千四百名机关干部一个上午在三十万平方米的地面上除尽了所有的杂草。
    各机关、学校、企业单位内部，今天歼灭蚊蝇的活动也很紧张。中共中央办公厅和中南海管理局两千多名干部和家属，人手一拍，见蝇就打。他们早晨六点钟就在河边上、院内设下了诱蝇点。过去卫生状况较差的清华大学，今天也以实际行动争得了上游，在两位党委书记指挥下，十三路“大军”共一万多人和蚊绳作战，学校附属的铸工场：机械加工场的废料堆，今天进行了彻底的整理和打扫，使大量藏蚊失去了老巢。宣武区酱菜厂的职工翻扣了一千多个水缸、酱坛、木桶，并把所有的容器和用具擦洗了一遍。
    各个街道上的居民，今天也在院子里、水井边上和胡同的拐角处，设立了无数个灭蝇的捕诱点。全国卫生红旗福绥境街道的九十五户居民设了一百三十个诱蝇点，居民们组成小组，轮流到各诱蝇点值班。天黑时，千家万户又燃起了熏蚊子的药粉，人们运用着各种可以致胜的方法向蚊蝇继续猛攻。
    今天是首都灭除蚊蝇战役的第一天。在明后两天内，全市除继续拍打和进一步调查、处理蚊蝇的孳生场所外，在城区、关厢一些蚊蝇较多的地区，将在规定的时间内采用烟熏的办法来灭除蚊蝇。（附图片）
