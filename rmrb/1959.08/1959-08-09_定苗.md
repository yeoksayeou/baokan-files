    Thinning Seedlings
  　Ba Bo
    When hoeing the sorghum for the third time, we thinned the seedlings.
    The seedlings grew so dark, strong, and complete that anyone who saw them couldn't help but praise them.
    We hoed under the sun, dripping with sweat.
    The small hoes raised fine waves of soil, and a joyful "cha-cha-cha" sound rang out in the field.
    The small hoe was like a nimble and free hand, leaving seedlings at a certain distance, moving the roots, and cultivating the soil.
    The small hoe was like a small bird, gliding happily on the ground. The birds were like our hearts, chirping happily above our heads.
    The young men and women were like arrowheads shot out on the skirmish line. The arrowheads shot out are always leading the way.
    I, who wields a pen, have lived to a ripe old age, and only now have I entered the world of labor. The small hoe in my hand felt unfamiliar and heavy. If I took care of thinning the seedlings, I couldn't take care of hoeing; if I took care of hoeing, I couldn't take care of thinning the seedlings. Before long, I fell behind everyone else.
    Only the production team leader was shoulder to shoulder with me.
    He exhorted:
      "Don't rush! Keep your energy up until the end!"
    He exhorted:
    "Don't rush! Move the roots of every seedling!"
    He exhorted:
    "Don't rush! Be sure to support any seedlings that have been knocked over!"
    He exhorted:
    "Don't rush! As the old saying goes, 'Fighting injures people, hoeing injures seedlings.' Now, injuring one seedling means the country will receive two fewer liang of grain!"
    He exhorted...
    I no longer felt the weight in my hand. Rather, for the sake of the motherland, I felt the weight on my shoulders.
    The production team leader's pace quickened. The small hoe in his hand moved lightly. He overtook everyone. He hoed to the end of the field. He turned around and took over my row to hoe. He was covered in sweat, but he didn't seem to notice at all.
    He pulled me up, and at the same time, made up for one person's backwardness in production.
    Thus, we were able to start simultaneously on another sorghum field in a skirmish line formation.
    At this moment, the production team leader's face full of sweat, in my eyes, looked like countless diamonds, shining brightly.

    定苗
  　巴波
    高粱锄第三遍时，定苗了。
    苗长得又黑又壮又全，谁见了都忍不住要称赞。
    我们顶着太阳，淌着汗水锄着。
    小锄掀起泥土的细浪，地里响起一片欢乐的“嚓嚓嚓”的声音。
    小锄像一只灵活自如的手，按一定距离留下苗子，动动根，培培土。
    小锄像小鸟，在地面上快活的滑翔。小鸟像我们的心灵，在我们的头上快活的鸣啭。
    小伙子和姑娘们，在散兵线上像射出去的箭的箭头。射出去的箭的箭头，总是领在前面。
    我，这个捏笔杆的，活了多大一把年纪，如今，才进入劳动的世界。小锄在我手中生疏而又沉重。顾了定苗，顾不了锄地；顾了锄地，又顾不了定苗。不久，就落在大家的后面了。
    只有生产队长和我肩并着肩。
    他叮咛着：
      “别急呵！劲头要能顶到底！”
    他叮咛着：
    “别急呵！每棵苗都要动动根！”
    他叮咛着：
    “别急呵！绊倒了的苗，一定要扶起来！”
    他叮咛着：
    “别急呵！过去俗话说，‘打仗伤人，锄地伤苗’。现在，伤一棵苗，国家要少收二两粮食呵！”
    他叮咛着……
    我再也不是手中感到重量。而是，为了祖国，肩上感到了重量。
    生产队长的脚步快了。小锄在他的手中，轻快地挥动着。他追过了大家。他锄到了地头。他回过身，又接我的垅锄过来。他满头是汗，但他似乎一点也没有觉察。
    他，拉了我一把，同时，补足了一个人在生产上的落后状态。
    于是，我们能够又以散兵线的阵势，在另一块高粱地同时开始。
    这时，生产队长的满头汗珠，在我的眼中，像无数颗钻石，光芒闪闪。
