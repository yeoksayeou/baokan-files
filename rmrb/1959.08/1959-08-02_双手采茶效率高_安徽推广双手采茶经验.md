Picking Tea with Both Hands is More Efficient
——Anhui Promotes Experience in Two-Handed Tea Picking

Picking tea with both hands means changing the common habit of picking tea with only one hand to using both hands simultaneously. This is a technical innovation that can significantly improve the efficiency of tea picking. As early as 1956, Anhui discovered that some tea farmers could pick tea with both hands. Since picking tea with both hands is faster than with one hand, a trial promotion was carried out in 1957, a key promotion in 1958, and a comprehensive implementation in 1959. By the spring of this year, ten thousand people had been trained to pick tea with both hands. During the spring tea season, these skilled two-handed tea pickers generally increased their daily yield of fresh leaves (picking the so-called "fine tea" of one bud and two or three leaves) from about twenty catties to thirty catties, with an average increase in efficiency of 25%; more than six thousand skilled two-handed tea pickers emerged who could pick over one hundred catties a day. It can be said that implementing two-handed tea picking is an effective measure to universally improve tea-picking efficiency and solve the problem of labor shortages during the tea season.

Judging from the situation of promoting two-handed tea picking in Anhui this year, to make this method widely promoted and improved, the following three aspects of work must be done well:

First, organize and lead the training of a group of key two-handed tea pickers to promote the implementation of two-handed tea picking among the masses. This is generally done within the scope of a county or commune, under the leadership of the Party committee, jointly organized by agricultural departments, women's federations, and other relevant units to hold on-site observation and training sessions, inviting skilled two-handed tea pickers to demonstrate operations, first enabling hundreds of cadres and active female tea pickers to learn two-handed tea picking; then, within the scope of production brigades and production teams, universally holding on-site training and adopting methods such as cadres being responsible for different areas and experienced workers mentoring new workers, organizing the masses to learn two-handed tea picking. Each tea-picking team is equipped with active members and skilled workers who have already learned two-handed tea picking. The experienced workers face-to-face pick tea from the same tea bush with the new workers, teaching one person and then another. In this way, more people are trained, and the promotion is wider and faster. In the month or so before and after the start of spring tea picking, each county had at least several hundred people and as many as 27,000 people who learned two-handed tea picking.

Second, it is necessary to study and practice diligently. To enable an unfamiliar hand to learn the skilled movements of the other hand in a very short period of time and be able to use both hands simultaneously requires a lot of hard work. Some people, in order to make their left hand as flexible as their right hand, not only seize the time before the tea season to practice tea-picking movements with their left hand by picking leaves from shrub trees, but even use their left hand to hold chopsticks when eating. When starting to pick tea from the tea garden, there are not many tea buds yet, so it is necessary to practice the left hand particularly diligently. In general, in the first few days, the left and right hands often lose sight of one another, and the efficiency is not high. But don't be discouraged, and you will get used to it after a week or so of hard practice. Zhang Qinghe, a skilled tea picker from She County, Anhui, used to pick only thirty to fifty catties a day. Last spring, he learned two-handed tea picking. After a season of hard work, he created records of picking 162 catties and 511.5 catties a day in the summer and autumn seasons, respectively. It can be seen that the key to improving efficiency with two-handed tea picking lies in diligent study and practice.

Third, implement the methods of "staggered periods and graded levels, paying according to output" and "setting quotas according to individuals, rewarding for exceeding production" to continuously improve efficiency and ensure quality.

"Setting quotas according to individuals, rewarding for exceeding production" is very important, because the strength of each person's labor force is different, and the foundation of technical level is different. If everyone is given a reward for exceeding the standard of fifty catties or one hundred catties per day, some will easily get the reward, while others will find it difficult to achieve. By implementing "setting quotas according to individuals, rewarding for exceeding production," regardless of age, strength, or experience, as long as they work hard, everyone can have a surplus to exceed.

    双手采茶效率高
    ——安徽推广双手采茶经验
    双手采茶就是把一般单用一只手采茶的习惯改为双手并用，这是一项技术改革，能够显著提高采茶工效。安徽早在1956年就发现有的茶农能双手采茶。双手采茶比一只手快，于是就在1957年试行推广，1958年重点推广，1959年全面推行。到今年春季，已经培训了十万人能双手采茶了。在春茶期间，这些双手采茶的能手们，采摘一芽二、三叶的所谓细茶，每人日采生叶数量一般都由二十来斤提高到三十来斤，平均工效提高了25％；还出现了六千多名日采超百斤的双手快速采茶能手。可以这样说，实行双手采茶，是普遍提高采茶工效，解决茶季劳力不足的一项有效措施。
    从安徽今年推行双手采茶的情况看来，要使这项方法普遍推广和提高，必须做好这样三方面工作：
    第一，有组织有领导地培训一批双手采茶骨干，来推动广大群众实行双手采茶。这里一般都是以县或公社为范围，在党委领导下由农业部门、妇联等有关单位联合起来举办现场观摩训练，聘请双手采茶能手做示范操作，先使数百名干部和采茶妇女积极分子学会了双手采茶；再以生产大队和生产队为范围普遍举办现场训练以及采取干部分片负责和老手带新手的办法，组织广大群众学习双手采茶。在每个采茶专业队里都配备有已经学会双手采茶的积极分子和能手，老手带新手面对面地同采一丛茶，教会一个再教一个。这样，培训的人就多，推行的面就大、就快。在春茶开采前后的个把月里，每个县少的有几百人，多的有二万七千多人学会了双手采茶。
    第二，要勤学苦练。要使一只生疏的手在很短期内学会另一只手的熟练的动作而能双手并用，是必须经过一番勤苦锻炼的。有些人为了使左手和右手一样地灵活，不仅抓紧在茶季以前用采摘灌木树叶来练习左手采茶动作，甚至连吃饭拿筷也用左手。开始采摘园茶的时候，茶芽还不太多，必须特别勤练左手。一般在开头几天，左右两手往往顾此失彼，效率不高。但是千万不要灰心，苦练个把星期，就习惯了。安徽歙县采茶能手张青和，原先一天也只采到三、五十斤，去年春季学会了双手采茶，经过一季苦练，在夏、秋两季中就分别创造了日采一百六十二斤和五百十一斤半的纪录。由此可见，双手采茶提高效率的关键在于勤学苦练。
    第三，实行“分期分级，以产计工”和“因人定额，超产奖励”的办法，不断提高工效和保证质量。
  “因人定额，超产奖励”十分重要，因为每个人的劳动力强弱程度不同，技术高低基础不同，如果一律按照日采五十斤或者一百斤的标准超产给奖，就会有的容易得奖，有的很难达到。而实行“因人定额，超产奖励”，就可以不论老幼强弱，或老手新手，只要经过努力都能有产可超。（阳浚）
