　　The Road of Geneva Accords Must Be Followed
　　By a commentator of this newspaper
    The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on August 17 regarding the Laotian situation, expressing the reasonable concern of the Soviet government and people about the deteriorating situation in Laos, and hoping that the current negotiations between the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina on the normalization of the Laotian situation can achieve positive results. As one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union, in view of the increasingly serious situation in Laos, calls on the parties concerned to take joint constructive measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are fully and duly implemented in Laos. This is undoubtedly an important and timely action to safeguard the Geneva Accords and eliminate the tense situation in Laos. According to the "Laotian Patriotic Newspaper," the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front sent a letter on August 9 to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, requesting them to take measures to ensure the strict and thorough implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. Now, the statement of the Soviet Foreign Ministry is also a response to the earnest wishes of the Laotian people. There is reason to demand that the other chairman of the Geneva Conference—the British government—adopt a position of upholding rather than abandoning the Geneva Accords, and to make a corresponding response quickly.
    The United States has consistently openly hated and undermined the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, conspired to overthrow the Laotian coalition government, undermine the peace and neutrality of Laos, transported a large number of American military personnel and military materials, and established military bases in Laos. Finally, it instigated the Sananikone government to brazenly abandon the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements and provoke a civil war. The crimes of the United States in interfering in and invading Laos are obvious and undeniable. However, the US State Department has recently issued four consecutive statements, portraying itself as an innocent lamb, while falsely accusing China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of "sabotaging" the agreement, saying that "the Communist imperialism of the Far East has provoked a serious crisis." It is obvious that this trick of the wolf in sheep's clothing by the US State Department is not only an attempt to conceal its crimes of interference and aggression against Laos, but also to create an excuse for the next step of implementing direct military intervention.
    As everyone knows, creating a tense situation and then using this tense situation to launch armed aggression is a habitual trick of US imperialism. Now, the United States is instigating the Sananikone government to take measures to expand the civil war, and at the same time using this as an excuse to plan to internationalize the Laotian civil war, so that it can directly intervene. The United States is not only actively planning to send troops from its vassal states such as Thailand and South Vietnam into Laos, but also, through the signing of the French-Laotian agreement, American military personnel are openly entering Laos in a steady stream, strengthening their control over the Laotian army. US Chief of Naval Operations Burke openly clamored on August 17 that the US Navy might be dragged into the Laotian civil war. He said: "If the United States believes that the situation requires the United States to provide military support, the Navy will send an aircraft carrier task force to the area." This American general's war hysteria blatantly shows that US imperialism is deliberately leading the Laotian situation to an extremely dangerous path.
    Therefore, in order to ease the tense situation in this region, it is necessary to stop the interference of US imperialism, stop the Laotian authorities from further expanding the civil war, and implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The statement of the Soviet Foreign Ministry and the letter of the Lao Patriotic Front propose that the activities of the International Commission for Laos should be restored. This is an important measure to safeguard the Geneva Accords, and all countries related to the Geneva Accords have no reason to oppose this proposal. However, according to reports, the United States is secretly plotting illegal "intervention" by the United Nations, attempting to replace the International Commission with sending so-called UN "observers" to completely bury the Geneva Accords, in order to let go of expanding its aggression in the Far East. It must be pointed out that any attempt to abandon the legitimate path of the Geneva Accords can only pave the way for the United States to expand its aggression and seize the entire Indochina, which is not only detrimental to the independence of Laos and the peace of Indochina, but also will bring serious consequences to the international situation, and will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Laotian people and all countries and people who safeguard world peace.
    The patriotic people of Laos, facing the situation that US imperialism and the Laotian reactionary group are colluding with each other and expanding the civil war, are forced to rise up to fight in self-defense against the interference and aggression of US imperialism, to defend the independent and free rights of their motherland, and to safeguard the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front pointed out that it is always willing to cooperate with the Lao Royal Government to jointly build a peaceful, neutral, democratic, unified and prosperous Laos. However, the Sananikone government has broken its promise, acted arbitrarily, brought wolves into the house, and harmed the country and the people. Therefore, all peace-loving people in the world have deep sympathy for the just struggle of the Lao patriotic people. The Chinese people are fully convinced that the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements will eventually triumph, and all forces hostile to the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements will suffer a shameful defeat.

　　必须遵循日内瓦协议的道路
　　本报评论员
    苏联外交部8月17日就老挝局势发表声明，表达了苏联政府和人民对于日益恶化的老挝局势的合理关切，并希望印度支那问题日内瓦会议的两位主席目前就老挝局势正常化的问题举行的谈判能获得积极的结果。作为日内瓦会议主席之一的苏联，在当前老挝局势日趋严重的情况下，要求有关方面采取共同的建设性措施，以使日内瓦协议在老挝得到全面的、应有的履行，这无疑是维护日内瓦协议和消除老挝紧张局势的重要而适时的行动。据“老挝爱国报”报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会已在8月9日致函日内瓦会议两位主席——苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德，要求他们采取措施，保障日内瓦协议和万象协议各项条款得到严格和彻底的履行。现在苏联外交部的声明也正是对于老挝人民殷切愿望的一个答复。人们有理由要求日内瓦会议的另一主席——英国政府采取维护而不是背弃日内瓦协议的立场，并迅速作出相应的回答。
    美国一贯公开地仇视和破坏日内瓦协议及万象协议，阴谋搞垮老挝联合政府，破坏老挝的和平中立，运进大量的美国军事人员和军事物资，并在老挝建立军事基地，最后更唆使萨纳尼空政府悍然废弃日内瓦协议和万象协议，挑起内战。美国干涉和侵略老挝的罪行，是有目共睹、不容狡赖的。但是，最近美国国务院却连续四次发表声明，把自己装扮成无罪的羔羊，而反诬中国和越南民主共和国“破坏”协议，说什么“远东的共产帝国主义挑起一次严重的危机”。很显然，美国国务院这种恶狼披羊皮的骗术，不仅是企图掩饰它对老挝干涉和侵略的罪行，同时也为了替下一步实行直接的军事干涉制造借口。
    尽人皆知，一手制造紧张局势，反过来又利用这种紧张局势发动武装侵略，这是美帝国主义的惯伎。现在，美国一面唆使萨纳尼空政府采取扩大内战的措施，一面以此为借口正在策划使老挝内战国际化，以便它直接插手干涉。美国不但正在积极策划要把泰国和南越等美国仆从国家的军队派入老挝，而且通过法国和老挝协定的签订，美国军事人员正在源源地公开进入老挝，加强对老挝军队的控制。美国海军作战部长伯克8月17日公开叫嚣，美国海军可能被拉入老挝内战，他说：“如果美国认为局势要求美国给予军事上的支持，海军将派一支航空母舰特遣部队到这个地区”。这位美国将军的战争歇斯底里，露骨地表明了美帝国主义蓄意要把老挝局势引向极端危险的道路。
    因此，为了缓和这一地区的紧张局势，必须制止美帝国主义的干涉，制止老挝当局进一步扩大内战的行为，贯彻执行日内瓦协议和万象协议。苏联外交部的声明和老挝爱国战线党的信件提出应该恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，这是维护日内瓦协议的一项重要措施，一切与日内瓦协议有关的国家没有任何理由反对这一主张。但是，据消息透露，美国正在暗中策划联合国“干涉”的非法活动，企图以派遣所谓联合国“观察员”代替国际委员会来彻底埋葬日内瓦协议，以便放手扩大它在远东的侵略活动。必须指出，一切想要抛开日内瓦协议正当途径的企图，都只能是为美国扩大侵略，霸占整个印度支那的野心计划铺平道路，这不但不利于老挝的独立和印度支那的和平，而且将给国际局势带来严重的后果，因而必将遭到老挝人民和一切维护世界和平的国家和人民的坚决反对。
    老挝爱国人民是在面对着美帝国主义和老挝反动集团狼狈为奸、扩大内战的形势下，被迫起来为反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，为保卫祖国的独立自由权利，维护日内瓦协议和万象协议而进行自卫斗争的。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会指出，它始终愿意同老挝王国政府方面合作，共同建设和平、中立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。但是萨纳尼空政府却背信弃义，一意孤行，引狼入室，祸国殃民。因此，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都对老挝爱国人民的正义斗争抱有深切的同情。中国人民完全相信，日内瓦协议和万象协议的精神终将胜利，一切敌视日内瓦协议和万象协议的势力都将遭到可耻的失败。
