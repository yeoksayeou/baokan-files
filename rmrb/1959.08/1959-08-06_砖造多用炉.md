    Brick-Built Multi-Purpose Stove

    The Harbin Maternal and Child Sanatorium has successfully created a "brick-built multi-purpose stove." It can simultaneously steam rice, stir-fry dishes, heat water, and bake bread; it can also provide heating for two or three rooms through a heated wall.

    When this "multi-purpose stove" is burning, the smoke and flames, in addition to rushing towards the pot holes, also pass through the baking oven, enter the heated wall, and then flow along the flues of the heated wall to the bottom of the water tank, finally being discharged from the chimney at the back. Heat can be fully utilized.

    The total construction cost of this stove is only over fifty yuan. It is suitable for kindergartens, hospitals, institutions, and schools.

    砖造多用炉
    哈尔滨市妇婴旅馆创造成功一种“砖造多用炉”。它可以同时蒸饭，炒菜，热水，烤面包；还可以通过火墙供两、三个房间取暖。
    这种“多用炉”烧火时，烟火除冲向锅眼外，还经过烤炉，进入火墙，再顺着火墙的烟道进入水箱底部，最后由后面的烟囱排出。热量可以充分利用。
    这种炉子全部建造费用只要五十多元。它适用于幼儿园、医院、机关和学校等。
