The "New York Post" published an article by McLeod describing the tragic experiences of an American unemployed man and his family. The article reads:

    Rahman Roman, 42, is unemployed and has been unable to find work for six months. He and his family live in a simple room at 62 Tenth Street in Brooklyn, New York. They have eaten everything they can in the house. The owner of the grocery store next door notified Roman on Monday that he could no longer sell them anything on credit.

    Roman's six-month-old baby, Alfredo, cries constantly because he is hungry. Two-and-a-half-year-old Carlo whimpers all day long. The four older children, Juan, 14, Angeli, 10, Arora, 8, and Ramon, 6, already know that crying doesn't solve problems, so they sit silently, staring with their big eyes.

    Roman felt pessimistic and hopeless. On Thursday, he took his five older children to the social security office at 147 East 67th Street to ask for relief. His request was denied. Roman requested for four hours, and finally he couldn't control himself anymore. He said, "My wife said she would rather have the children's throats cut than see them starve. I'm leaving them here because I might get angry enough to pick up a gun and kill someone."

    Roman instructed his four sons and daughter Arora to stay at the social security office, while he walked away. Arora cried and didn't want to stay, so she followed her father home. The four boys obeyed their father's instructions and stayed behind.

    After a while, the police arrested Roman, saying it was based on a decree prohibiting parents from abandoning their children in social security offices. Roman was put in jail.

    On Friday, a judge in Manhattan court announced that Roman had to pay $1,000 to be released on bail. Roman had no job and no money, so he had to return to prison. Arora (Roman's eight-year-old daughter) stood at the window holding the crying baby Alfredo... The wife asked the unemployed man, "What am I going to do? What am I going to do?..."

    失业者一家的悲惨遭遇
    “纽约邮报”发表了麦克劳德的一篇描写一个美国失业者一家的悲惨遭遇的文章。这篇文章写道：
    四十二岁的腊曼·罗曼是个失业者，他已经有六个月找不到工作了。他的一家住在纽约布鲁克林十号街六十二号门牌的一间简陋的房间里。他们把家里可以吃的东西全都吃光了。隔壁食品杂货铺的老板在星期一已通知罗曼，再也不能赊卖东西给他们了。
    罗曼的六个月的婴儿阿利夫雷多因为肚子饿总是啼哭。两周岁半的卡洛一天到晚嘤嘤啜泣。四个大孩子，十四岁的胡安、十岁的安赫利、八岁的阿罗拉和六岁的拉蒙已经懂得哭并不能解决问题，就一声不响地坐着，瞪着他们的大眼睛。
    罗曼感到悲观失望。星期四那天，他带了五个大孩子到六十七号大街东面一百四十七号门牌社会保险机关要求救济。他的要求被拒绝了。罗曼要求了四个钟头，最后他再也控制不住了，他说：“我妻子说，宁愿让孩子们的咽喉被割断，也不愿意看到他们挨饿。我把他们留在这里，因为我可能发狠到拿起手枪来杀人。”
    罗曼嘱咐四个儿子和女儿阿罗拉留在社会保险机关，而自己却走开了。阿罗拉哭着不愿意留下来，就追随着父亲跑回家。四个男孩听从了父亲的嘱咐留了下来。
    过了一回儿，警察逮捕了罗曼，说这是根据禁止父母把子女遗弃在社会保险机关的法令。罗曼被关进了监狱。
    星期五，曼哈顿法庭的法官宣布，罗曼要交一千美元才可以被保释。罗曼既没有工作，又没有钱，只得回到了监狱。阿罗拉（罗曼的八岁的女儿）手中抱着正在啼哭的婴儿阿利夫雷多站在窗口……妻子问失业者：“叫我怎么办呢？叫我怎么办呢？……”
