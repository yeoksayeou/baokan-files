　　Strengthen Unified Leadership
　　Build Industrial Bases at High Speed
　　Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Wuhan City undertook large-scale industrial infrastructure construction on the basis of the First Five-Year Plan. In addition to the continued construction of large enterprises such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and Wuhan Boiler Plant, new industrial zones such as Guanshan, Wudong, Gedian, and Hanyang were opened up, and mechanical, chemical, electrical and other enterprises were planned and built. The experience of the past year has proved that, under the unified deployment and arrangement of the Central Government, with the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, the construction experience accumulated and the construction teams cultivated during the First Five-Year Plan period, coupled with the help of Soviet experts, our industrial construction can be developed at a high speed.

　　In the practice of building new industrial bases, what basic experiences have we gained?

　　First, strengthening the Party's unified leadership is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out socialist industrial construction at high speed. Socialist industrial construction is a very complex and arduous undertaking, like a large-scale modern battle, a highly mobile combined arms operation; without the strong, powerful, absolute, and unified leadership of the Party, there will inevitably be numerous contradictions, lack of coordination, and even offsetting forces, affecting progress.

　　In the construction process in Wuhan City, unified regional Party committees and regional construction headquarters were organized at the construction site, and all work related to the construction area was placed under the unified leadership of the Party committee. This unification was a process of gradual exploration and development. Initially, it was felt that urban construction such as roads, water, electricity, and sewers in the construction area, as well as the supply of daily necessities, often could not closely coordinate with the requirements of industrial construction, affecting the construction progress. Therefore, these departments were first placed under the unified leadership of the regional Party committee to carry out their work. However, this did not solve the contradictions on the construction site itself, such as between Party A and Party B, general contractors and subcontractors, and between construction and installation, because the leadership systems were different, and the planning arrangements and progress requirements were inconsistent, so many contradictions also occurred in specific actions. For this reason, all types of work related to the construction site were further organized under the unified arrangement and command of the regional Party committee and regional construction headquarters. This greatly concentrated forces and accelerated progress. As the construction progress accelerated, the preparatory work for production appeared to lag behind, so the infrastructure construction and production preparation work of the new factory were placed under the unified leadership of the new factory's preparatory office.

　　The Party's unified leadership is first manifested in the unity of policies and ideas. No matter how complex the construction procedures and aspects are, and no matter how many contradictions there are between them, there is a common goal, which is to build enterprises well according to the national plan and put them into production as soon as possible. Regardless of how different the opinions of various parties may be, they must arrange their work under the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." Therefore, surveying and mapping must create conditions for design, design must create conditions for construction, construction and installation must serve production, the rear must serve the front, and urban construction must serve the production and life of the new industrial zone. Everything is for the purpose of completing the construction projects on schedule, with guaranteed quality and quantity, and putting them into production. Once this fundamental concept is established among all employees, coupled with the unity of organization and the unity of planning and arrangements, it is possible to achieve consistent action and concentrated forces.

　　Second, concentrate forces and ensure key projects. The key projects built by the state in the Wuhan area are important projects related to the "national chessboard," and putting these projects into production as soon as possible can quickly increase new production capacity and provide huge material conditions for further expansion of construction. Therefore, under the principle of the "national chessboard," concentrating forces, ensuring key projects, and taking care of general projects is the general guideline for action.

　　This has several meanings. On the one hand, according to this principle, plans are repeatedly ranked to concentrate material resources, financial resources, and human resources mainly to meet the needs of key projects, while at the same time, based on the internal connections between key projects and general projects, comprehensive arrangements are made and taken into account, so that key projects are highlighted and are not isolated, and can adapt to and connect with each other. Second, the idea of "ensuring key projects and supporting key projects" should be widely and deeply publicized to the masses, mobilizing and organizing the forces of all aspects of the city to form an atmosphere of everyone supporting key projects. We formed a "Support Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Headquarters" to vigorously support the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and other key projects in terms of transportation, the supply of local materials, the manufacture of non-standard equipment, as well as the supply of daily necessities and cultural life. Third, project ranking is also carried out monthly on the construction site, concentrating superior forces, organizing battles according to the construction progress, with one or several projects as the main direction of attack in each battle, distinguishing between primary and secondary, differentiating between first and last, completing one batch and then starting another batch, building one workshop after another. This is much more effective than spreading out on all fronts, dispersing forces, and prolonging the process. Of course, while ensuring key projects, general projects related to people's lives must also be taken care of, so as not to affect the progress of key projects in turn.

　　Facts have proved that greed for more and faster progress regardless of actual conditions will only become slow; strictly following objective laws, fully developing subjective initiative in a planned way, clarifying the internal connections of each construction project, and advancing in an organized manner may seem slow, but in reality, it is fast.

　　Third, take the technical revolution as the center, vigorously carry out mass movements, and comprehensively, quickly, well, and economically complete the plan. Combining the idea of ​​the Great Leap Forward, the soaring enthusiasm, and the meticulous scientific analysis and realistic work style is the decisive condition for fully completing the plan. After the battle plan and the main direction of the battle are determined, meticulous ideological and organizational work becomes the decisive link in determining victory or defeat. Our method is: in the construction battle, organize mixed combat teams of various types of work according to the construction plan, and promote all-rounders; establish the overall concept of everything for the leading project, and adopt multi-type of work three-dimensional cross-flow operation method; technically, try to promote prefabricated structures and mechanized construction; tightly grasp the design, materials, construction, quality, and safety checkpoints, and organize large-scale cooperation; before construction, gather technical personnel, staff, workers, and cadres from the design and construction departments to repeatedly review the drawings, master the construction essentials, emphasize quality and safety, and carry out mass quality and safety inspection campaigns. Under the conditions of fully preparing the work, vigorously engage in technical innovation and carry out a vigorous mass movement. If the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses can be brought into play, outstanding achievements can be created in construction. In the Guanshan Industrial Zone alone, four large electromechanical factories with fourteen workshops and some auxiliary projects were built in half a year after construction began, with a completed factory building area of ​​100,000 square meters. This was unimaginable during the First Five-Year Plan period.

　　We also had some shortcomings in our work last year, such as: emphasizing rapid construction, neglecting quality and safety in certain links, etc. We have conducted a thorough inspection in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government this year, made remedies, and summarized the lessons in this regard, so that we can do better in the future.

　　加强统一领导
　　高速度地建设工业基地
　　中共武汉市委第一书记　宋侃夫
    在大跃进的1958年，武汉市在第一个五年计划的基础上进行了大规模的工业基本建设。除了武汉钢铁公司、武汉重型机床厂、武汉锅炉厂等大型企业的续建以外，还开辟了关山、武东、葛店、汉阳等新工业区，有计划地兴建机械、化工、电机等企业。一年来的经验证明，在中央的统一部署和安排下，我们有着党中央和湖北省委的正确领导，有着在第一个五年计划期间积累的建设经验和培养出来的建设队伍，再加上苏联专家的帮助，我们的工业建设是可以高速度地发展的。
    在建设新工业基地的实践中，我们取得了哪些基本经验呢？
    第一，加强党的统一领导是高速度进行社会主义工业建设的根本保证。社会主义工业建设是一项十分复杂艰巨的事业，犹如大规模的现代化作战一样，是高度机动的诸兵种协同作战；没有党的坚强有力的、绝对的、统一的领导，就必然矛盾重重，互不协调，甚至还会抵消力量，影响进度。
    武汉市在建设过程中，在施工现场组织了统一的地区党委和地区建设指挥部，凡属于有关建设地区的一切工作都置于党委的统一领导之下。这个统一是逐步摸索逐步发展的过程。开始是感到了在建设地区的马路、水、电、下水道等城市建设和生活物资的供应等，和工业建设的要求往往不能紧密配合，影响施工进程。因此，首先把这些部门放在地区党委的统一领导下进行工作。但是这并不能解决施工现场本身的矛盾，如甲方和乙方，大包和二包，建筑和安装之间，因为领导的系统不同，计划安排和进程要求不一，所以在具体行动中也发生不少矛盾。为此，又进一步把施工现场有关各方面的工种都组织起来，由地区党委和地区建设指挥部统一安排计划，统一指挥。这样就大大集中了力量，加快了进度。施工进度加快，生产准备工作就显得跟不上，便又把新建工厂的基本建设和生产准备工作置于新建厂筹建处的统一领导之下。
    党的统一领导首先表现在政策思想的统一。不管建设的程序和建设的方面如何复杂，相互之间的矛盾有多少，但是都有着一个共同的目的，就是按照国家计划建设好企业，早日投入生产。不管各方面的意见如何不同，都必须在“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线下安排自己的工作。因此，勘测必须为设计创造条件，设计要为施工创造条件，施工和安装又必须为生产服务，后方要为前方服务，城市建设为新建工业区的生产和生活服务。一切为了使建设工程能按期按质按量地建成投入生产，这个根本的观念在全体职工中树立起来了，再加上组织上的统一，计划安排上的统一，就能够做到行动一致，力量集中。
    第二，集中力量，确保重点。国家在武汉地区兴建的各项重点工程是关系到“全国一盘棋”的重要项目，这些项目及早建成投入生产，就能够迅速增加新的生产能力，为进一步扩大建设提供巨大的物质条件。因此，在“全国一盘棋”的原则下，集中力量、确保重点、照顾一般，是总的行动方针。
    这有几方面的意义。一方面是根据这个原则在计划安排上反复排队，把物力、财力和人力主要集中满足重点的需要，同时又根据重点项目与一般项目的内在联系，全面安排，加以兼顾，这样既使重点突出，又使重点不致孤立，能够互相适应，互相衔接。其次是把“确保重点，支援重点”的思想广泛深入地宣传到广大群众中去，动员和组织全市各方面的力量，形成人人支援重点的风气。我们组成了“支援武钢指挥部”，在交通运输、地方材料的供应、制造非标准设备，以及生活物资供应和文化生活等方面，大力地支援了武钢及其它重点工程的建设。第三，在施工现场上也按月进行工程排队，集中优势力量，按施工进度组织战役，每一战役又以一个或几个项目为主攻方向，分清主次，区别先后，完成一批，再上一批，一个车间一个车间地建设。这比全面铺开，分散力量，旷日持久的做法要有效得多。当然，在确保重点的同时，对于与人民生活有关的一般性项目也必须加以照顾，以免反过来影响重点工程的进行。
    事实证明，不顾实际条件的贪多求快，只会变成慢；严格按照客观规律，有计划地充分发挥主观能动性，摸清各个建设项目的内在联系，有阵地地前进，看来是慢，实际上是快。
    第三，以技术革命为中心，大搞群众运动，全面地、多快好省地完成计划。把跃进的思想、冲天的干劲和细致的科学分析、实事求是的作风结合起来，这是全面完成计划的决定性条件。在战役计划和战斗主攻方面确定以后，细致的思想工作和组织工作就成了决定胜负的环节。我们的办法是：在施工战斗中，根据施工计划组织诸工种的混合战斗队，推广多面手；树立一切为了主导工程的整体观念，采取多工种立体交叉流水作业法；在技术上尽量推行预制结构和机械化施工；紧紧抓住设计、材料、施工和质量、安全几关，组织大协作；在施工以前召集设计和施工部门的技术人员、职员、工人和干部一起反复会审图纸，掌握施工要领，强调质量和安全，开展群众性的质量和安全检查运动。在充分做好准备工作的条件下，大搞技术革新，开展热火朝天的群众运动。能把群众的智慧和干劲发挥出来，在施工中就能创造出色的成绩。仅在关山工业区，开工半年后就建成了四个大型机电工厂的十四个车间和部分辅助工程，建成厂房面积达十万平方米。这在第一个五年计划时期是不能想像的。
    我们去年的工作中也有一些缺点，如：强调了快速施工，在某些环节上忽视了质量与安全等等。我们今年遵照中央的指示进行了彻底的检查，作了补救，并且总结这方面的教训，以便在今后把工作做得更好。
