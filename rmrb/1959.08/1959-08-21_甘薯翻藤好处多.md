Editor's Note: On July 21st, we published an article titled "On Field Management Issues of Sweet Potatoes," in which it was suggested that turning and lifting sweet potato vines would lead to reduced yields. This is a new issue that has attracted the attention of many. We are now publishing letters from two readers and the opinions of the Sweet Potato Research Institute below for everyone to study. We further hope that sweet potato producing areas will organize the masses to conduct comparative experiments on turning and not turning vines in a planned manner, learn from experience, improve sweet potato cultivation techniques, and strive for greater yield increases.

    Turning Sweet Potato Vines Has Many Benefits

    The Sweet Potato Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences wrote in "On Field Management Issues of Sweet Potatoes" that turning and lifting sweet potato vines would reduce yields. I think this is worth studying.

    Farmers say that turning sweet potato vines prevents roots from growing on the vines, which will increase yields. This is reasonable. To make the tubers grow quickly and large, more nutrients must be supplied. However, the many roots growing on the vines undoubtedly consume nutrients. We know that these roots do not produce organic matter to make the sweet potatoes grow larger; they only consume the substances synthesized by the stems and leaves through photosynthesis. The water and nutrients needed for stem and leaf growth are also not supplied by these roots, because the roots growing from the base of the sweet potato vines can continuously supply water and nutrients to the stems and leaves of the seedlings (of course, there must be sufficient water and nutrients in the soil).

    The Sweet Potato Research Institute mentioned that roots growing on the vines will also grow small sweet potatoes when they touch the ground. In fact, these roots do not necessarily grow small sweet potatoes. This is just like tillering in rice and wheat, some are effective tillers, and some are ineffective tillers. According to what I have actually seen, if the vines really grow sweet potatoes, they are pitifully small.

    When turning and lifting vines, some stems and leaves will be damaged due to the turning, which weakens the synthetic ability of the plants. This is a problem that deserves serious attention. But it cannot be denied that this weakening of plant synthetic ability is not absolute. When moonflower seedlings are grafted onto sweet potato seedlings, and different quality sweet potato seedlings are grafted together, the sweet potato vines are subjected to some damage, which has a significant impact on plant synthesis. However, from the later harvest, the yield is not low. This shows that the damage to stems and leaves does not absolutely weaken the plant's synthetic ability. From another perspective, the stem and leaf damage caused by turning and lifting vines can be avoided. As long as the person turning the vines is careful and gentle, the stems and leaves will not be damaged.

    Therefore, I think it is very necessary to turn and lift the vines. Doing so has the following benefits: it can destroy the roots growing on the vines, avoiding unnecessary nutrient consumption; moving the sweet potato seedlings to the ridge can reduce water evaporation on the ridge; it can inhibit the growth of weeds on the ridge, which is conducive to sweet potato growth.

### 甘薯翻藤好处多

专栏：

    编者按：7月21日我们发表了“谈甘薯田间管理问题”一文，其中提出甘薯翻藤、提藤会遭致减产。这是一个新问题，已引起不少人的注意。现在我们把两位读者的来信和甘薯研究所的意见发表在下面，供大家研究。我们更希望甘薯产区有计划地组织群众作些翻藤与不翻藤的对比试验，从中吸取经验，提高甘薯栽培技术，争取更多增产。
    甘薯翻藤好处多
    中国农业科学院甘薯研究所写的“谈甘薯田间管理问题”里，说到甘薯翻藤和提藤都会减产。我觉得值得研究。
    农民说甘薯翻藤是使藤上不生根，会提高产量。这是有理由的。要使薯块长得快长得大，必须有更多的养分供给。可是藤上长了很多根，无疑要消耗养分。我们知道这种根并不会制造使甘薯长大的有机物，它只有消耗茎叶在光合作用下合成的物质。茎叶生长所需要的水分和养料也完全不用借助这些根供给，因薯藤基部长出的根就能不断供给薯苗茎叶的水分和养料（当然土壤里要有足够的水分和养分）。
    甘薯研究所提到藤上生的根着地也会长小甘薯。事实上这些根不一定能长出小甘薯。这正如同水稻和小麦的分蘖一样，有的是有效分蘖，有的是无效分蘖。据我实地看到，藤上真能长甘薯，也小得可怜。
    翻藤提藤时，因翻动会损伤一部分茎叶，致使植株合成能力削弱，这是值得严重注意的问题。但也不可否认，这种植株合成能力削弱并不是绝对的。当月光花苗嫁接薯苗，不同品质薯苗嫁接时，薯藤都受到了一定的损伤，这对植株合成有不小的影响。但从以后的收成上看，产量并不低。这说明茎叶的损伤对植株合成能力的削弱不是绝对的。我们从另一面来看，翻藤、提藤造成的茎叶损伤也是可以避免的。只要翻藤的人小心谨慎，轻手轻脚，就不会损伤茎叶。
    因此，我认为翻藤、提藤是很必要的。这样做有以下好处：可以破坏藤上长根，避免不必要的养分消耗；把薯苗弄到垅上，可以减少垅上的水分蒸发；可以抑制垅上杂草生长，从而有利于甘薯生长。
