　　German Communist Party Central Committee Issues Statement Demanding Lifting of Ban
　　Where There Are People, There Is a Communist Party; Adenauer Cannot Stop the Wheel of History
　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 17th: "Neues Deutschland" published today the statement by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party on the third anniversary of the illegal banning of the German Communist Party. This statement calls on all people who cherish democratic rights to join the German Communist Party in demanding the lifting of the ban and the restoration of the German Communist Party's legal existence.
    The statement condemns Adenauer, Strauss, Schroeder, and Hauschka for attempting to stop the wheel of history and eliminate the German Communist Party. The statement said that their historically flawed plans cannot be realized. The German Communist Party, in mines, factories, schools, and anywhere where there are people and struggle, fights together with all democrats to combat the rule of the militarists and strive for political change in West Germany.
    The statement also pointed out that Adenauer and Strauss's policy of strength has gone bankrupt. Today, in international negotiations, people are talking about ending the Cold War, easing international tensions, preventing German militarism through the conclusion of a peace treaty, and achieving German reunification through German understanding. These are precisely the demands of the German Communist Party. Newspapers published in the German Democratic Republic today have published articles demanding that West Germany lift the ban on the German Communist Party.

　　德共中央发表声明要求废除禁令
　　有人民的地方就有共产党
　  阿登纳阻挡不了历史车轮
    新华社柏林17日电　“新德意志报”今天刊登了德国共产党中央委员会就德共被非法禁止三周年发表的声明。这个声明号召所有珍惜民主权利的人和德共一道要求废除禁令，恢复德共的合法存在。
    声明谴责阿登纳、施特劳斯、施罗德和豪辛格等企图阻止历史车轮前进，消灭德国共产党。声明说，但是他们违反历史的打算是不能实现的，德国共产党在矿山、工厂、学校等任何有人民和有斗争的地方，同所有民主主义者一道进行斗争，打击军国主义者的统治，争取在西德实现政治上的转变。
    声明还指出，阿登纳、施特劳斯的实力政策已经破产。今天在国际谈判中人们都谈论着结束冷战，缓和国际紧张局势，通过缔结和约制止德国军国主义以及通过德国人的谅解实现德国的统一。这些正是德国共产党的要求。今天德意志民主共和国出版的报纸都发表文章要求西德取消对德国共产党的禁令。
