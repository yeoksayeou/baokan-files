    The New Birth of Lagari Village
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Siyi
    A five-story high building with painted beams and carved rafters, vermilion eaves and golden roof, stands towering in the center of a cluster of low, dilapidated earthen houses. This is Lagari Village, the site of the "palace" of Lagari Langjie Gyatso (a rebellious element), the so-called "King of Shannan." In recent days, this ancient mountain village has been echoing with the sounds of gongs and drums, and the slogans of young people promoting the Three Antis (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula, anti-slavery) and Double Reduction (rent reduction, interest reduction). More than one hundred and forty serf households are immersed in the joy of emancipation. On the land of the rebellious lord, the emancipated serfs are cultivating for themselves for the first time. They diligently water and weed, and cheerful Tibetan folk songs constantly ring out in the fields. In the evening, people can also see the serfs joyfully singing and dancing in the square to celebrate their new life, unwilling to disperse until late at night.

    The Lagari Tibetan compatriots, who are good at singing and dancing, only began to live human lives after the evil rule of the "King of Shannan" Langjie Gyatso was destroyed. Langjie Gyatso was a "Zhasa" (third-rank official) of the original Tibetan local government, and also the actual ruler of the Lagari area. Nearly half of the approximately 20,000 "ke" (unit of measurement) of cultivated land in Lagari County belonged to this so-called "King of Shannan." The "palace" was equipped with a court and a prison, kept thugs, and also had various instruments of torture - there were whips and wooden sticks with iron-clad heads, leather palms specifically for slapping the cheeks, bamboo strips split into thin pieces for spanking, shackles, handcuffs, and head yokes, and wooden leg shackles weighing more than one hundred "jin" (unit of measurement) for three people chained together, etc. After the rebellion was quelled, human heads, arms, and three complete corpses were also found in the "palace." A male corpse and a female corpse were both bound hand and foot, curled up in a gloomy cellar, seemingly starved to death, and the corpse of a four- or five-year-old girl was stuffed in a jar, already shriveled and blackened due to the passage of time. It can be seen how cruel the "King of Shannan's" rule over the serfs was!

    Langjie Gyatso had a total of twenty-five "Xika" (estates) and ten pastures. In the "palace," only his mother and four other family members often lived, but there were more than sixty "Lang Sheng" (domestic slaves) to serve them. His annual income from exploitation on the land exceeded 70,000 "ke" of highland barley. The economic exploitation of the serfs was extremely cruel. For example, in a very small Zongsha "Xika," all the several thousand labor days needed by Langjie Gyatso to cultivate the "self-operated land" throughout the year were provided by the serfs at no cost, bringing their own tools and rations. He had a net income of about five hundred "ke" of highland barley annually from this "Xika," that is, he plundered four-fifths of the total value produced by the serfs. A part of the land in this "Xika" was distributed to the serfs for cultivation. Langjie Gyatso had a "sutra" book recording how much land each serf household rented and how much grain they should pay, with an oath of punishment for rent arrears written at the beginning of the book. Every year in the tenth month of the Tibetan calendar, at the height of the autumn harvest season, Langjie Gyatso's steward would summon the serfs to the "palace" courtyard, reciting the "sutra" while making the serfs kneel and swear. In years of poor harvest, they still had to pay land rent at a fixed rate of more than half of the normal harvest amount. Sangmutan, a serf in his sixties, and his old partner had no livestock or labor force, but Langjie Gyatso assigned him nine "ke" of seeds worth of land and forced him to cultivate it. The old man could not pay the land rent, and all his property was confiscated. Later, Langjie Gyatso found an excuse to beat him with more than a hundred wooden sticks and imprisoned him for two years. The old couple later had to beg for a living.

    The "palace" used small measures to issue usurious loans and pay wages, and large measures to collect debts and rent, which added another layer of exploitation to the serfs. Moreover, no matter when the loan was taken, they would come to press for debt during the autumn harvest season, and if they delayed, they would be whipped and the interest would increase daily. Langjie Gyatso also stipulated that every man over the age of eighteen had to pay ten "ke" of highland barley per year as a poll tax, and every woman over the age of fifteen had to pay eight "ke" per year. If they could not pay, with the "palace's" permission, it would be converted into debt, increasing by one "ke" of highland barley per year. If the usurious loans could not be repaid when due, like failing to pay rent, the serfs had to take their meager possessions to offset the debt, or send their children to become "Lang Sheng" to repay the debt. Wu Jin Ci Ren, a "Lang Sheng" of the "King of Shannan," had been weaving cloth and taking care of the "Linka" (gardens) in the palace since he was seventeen, receiving only one "sheng" (unit of measurement) of "Zanba" (roasted barley flour) per day for rations. After he got married and had children, it was not enough to eat, so he borrowed grain from Langjie Gyatso, borrowing one "sheng" in the spring and repaying two "sheng" in the fall. When he couldn't repay it on time, the interest compounded, forcing him to be a beast of burden for the "King of Shannan" for generations.

    The "King of Shannan" also had many other ways to suck the blood and sweat of the serfs. Four years ago, the Shannan area had a poor harvest, and highland barley once rose from three silver dollars per "dou" (unit of measurement) to twelve silver dollars per "dou." Langjie Gyatso forced the serfs to pay grain and did not allow them to pay rent in cash at the original price. Later, when the grain price fell to less than three yuan per "dou," he forced the serfs to pay cash at a price of three yuan per "dou." The repair of houses and the renovation of "Linka" in the "palace" were all carried out by the serfs, who brought their own rations to do "Ula" (corvée labor), and even the expenses of hiring carpenters and stonemasons were apportioned to the serfs. In the past, the entire or most part of the wages earned by the serfs who participated in the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways were confiscated by the serf owners and stewards.

    Langjie Rizhu, the steward of the "King of Shannan," once used more than two thousand silver dollars confiscated from his serfs to buy ten mules and horses. Serfs who were completely榨取 (zhàqǔ) exhausted often fled to other places when they could not survive. In Lagari Village, runaway households accounted for more than 30% of the total number of local serfs. The serfs who did not flee were destitute and lived extremely miserably. For example, the old quilt of the serf Wu Gen Quzhen had been used by generations for ninety-five years.

    Langjie Gyatso, the "King of Shannan," who vainly attempted to maintain the reactionary serf system forever, and his brothers, along with other reactionary big serf owners in Tibet, instigated a rebellion. On February 27th of this year, they convened a "People's Congress of the Independent Tibet" in Gongkangsa, Lagari area, attended by "representatives" from more than twenty "Zong" (districts) in the Shannan area, stipulating that all men under the age of forty and over the age of twenty must join the "Army to Defend Religion," and later established a "General Headquarters" in the "palace" of the "King of Shannan." However, the rebellious elements' good dreams did not last long. The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) troops to quell the rebellion quickly began their advance into the Shannan area, and this gang of rabble was immediately disintegrated. As soon as the PLA and the Military Control Commission work team arrived in Lagari, they immediately visited the poor and asked about their hardships, providing relief and loans of nearly a thousand "ke" of grain and some butter and tea to the poor serfs, and issuing more than two thousand "ke" of agricultural loans to serfs lacking seeds. In two months, the officers and soldiers of the troops contributed more than fourteen thousand labor days, helping farmers to cultivate land, deliver manure, weed, water, and repair canals, so that not a single "ke" of land was left uncultivated in Lagari County after the rebellion was quelled. The officers and soldiers of the various troops, from helping to repair houses and bridges to carrying water and picking firewood, from helping to treat illnesses and cut hair to improving sanitary conditions, permeated their love for the Tibetan compatriots, which moved the Tibetan compatriots even more deeply.

    Now, the former serfs have become the masters of Lagari. The old "palace" is the site of a primary school run by the local garrison to assist the residents, with one hundred and forty-five students. From the originally gloomy old "palace," the children's songs of "Socialism is Good" and laughter constantly ring out. The serfs, who yearn for cultural emancipation, have now established more than ten private primary schools throughout Lagari County.

    At present, eleven preparatory committees for farmers' associations have been established throughout Lagari County. The serfs are happily cultivating the land of the lords who participated in the rebellion in accordance with the policy of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it." Ula, usurious loans, poll taxes, and other exorbitant taxes have all been abolished, and the "Three Antis and Double Reduction" movement is being carried out step by step. Ben Ren Jianji, an old serf mother in her seventies, expressed her feelings this way: "The stones of Lagari have been lifted, and the sun is shining on our heads."

    拉加里村的新生
    新华社记者　周思义
    一座画栋雕梁、朱檐金顶的五层高楼，耸立在一片低矮破败的土房中央，这便是西藏所谓“山南王”拉加里·郎杰嘉措（叛乱分子）的“王府”所在地拉加里村。这个古老的山村，连日震响着青年们宣传三反（反叛乱、反乌拉、反奴役）双减（减租、减息）的锣鼓声和口号声，一百四十多户农奴正沉浸在翻身的欢乐中。在叛乱领主的土地上，翻身农奴们正第一次为自己耕种，他们勤奋地浇水、除草，田野上不时响起愉快的藏族民歌。傍晚，人们还可以看到农奴们为了庆贺自己的新生，在广场上欢乐地歌舞，到深夜还不愿散去。
    拉加里能歌善舞的藏族同胞，是在“山南王”郎杰嘉措的罪恶统治被摧毁以后，才抬起头来开始过人的生活的。郎杰嘉措是原西藏地方政府的“札萨”（三品官），也是拉加里地区的实际统治者。拉加里全县约两万克种子的耕地，将近一半是属于这个所谓“山南王”的。“王府”里设有法庭和监狱，养有打手，还备有各种刑具——有皮鞭和头上包铁皮的木棍，有专打面颊的皮掌，有劈成细条的打屁股的竹片，有脚镣、手铐和头枷，有重一百多斤的三人连环木脚镣等等。叛乱平息后，在“王府”里还发现了人的头颅、手臂和三具完整的尸体。一具男尸和一具女尸都被扎缚了手脚蜷坐在阴森森的地窖里，看来是活活饿死的，另一具四五岁女孩的尸体塞在一个坛子里，因为年深月久已经干癟、发黑了。可见“山南王”对农奴的统治是多么残酷！
    郎杰嘉措共有二十五个溪卡、十个牧场。在“王府”里经常只住着他母亲等五口人，可是却有六十多个朗生（家奴）来伺候。他每年在土地上的剥削所得超过七万克青稞。对农奴的经济剥削极其残酷，例如，在一个很小的宗莎溪卡，郎杰嘉措耕种“自营地”全年所需要的两千几百个劳动日，全部由农奴们自带工具和口粮无偿地出乌拉。他在这个溪卡每年净收入约五百多克青稞，即是掠夺了农奴们所生产的全部价值的五分之四。这个溪卡的一部分土地是分给农奴耕种的，郎杰嘉措有一本写着各家农奴租种多少地、应缴多少粮的“经书”，书首写着欠租受罚的誓词。每年藏历十月，正当秋收时节，郎杰嘉措的管家就把农奴们召集在“王府”大院里，一面宣读“经书”，一面要农奴们下跪宣誓。在歉收年头，也得按正常收获量一半以上的固定租额缴纳地租。六十多岁的农奴桑木坦和他的老伴，没有牲口，没有劳动力，郎杰嘉措却派给他九克种子的土地强迫他耕种，老人缴不上地租，被没收了全部家产。以后，郎杰嘉措又寻事把他打了一百多木棍，并且把他监禁了两年。老俩口后来只能求乞度日。
      “王府”用小斗放高利贷、发工资，用大斗收债、收租，这就对农奴们加重了一层剥削。而且，不论什么时候借贷，到秋收时就来逼债，拖延时日就得挨鞭打，还要按日增加利息。郎杰嘉措还规定，他的农奴十八岁以上的男子每人每年要缴十克青稞的人头税，十五岁以上的妇女每人每年交八克，交不出时，经过“王府”允许，转为欠债，逐年增加一克青稞的利息。到期的高利贷还不起，就像缴不上租那样，农奴们必需把仅有的一点财物拿去折抵，或是把自己的子女送去当郎生抵债。“山南王”的郎生吴金次仁，从十七岁起便在王府里织布，看管林卡，每天只得到一升糌粑的口粮。他结婚以后添了孩子，不够吃，向郎杰嘉措借粮食，春借一升秋还两升，到时还不出就利上滚利，这笔债务逼得他世世代代要给“山南王”当牛马。
      “山南王”还有许多吮吸农奴血汗的方法。四年前，山南地区歉收，青稞一度由三块银元一斗上涨到十二块银元一斗，郎杰嘉措就强迫农奴们缴纳粮食，不准按原价折款缴租；后来粮价下跌到每斗三元以下，他却按三元一斗的折价强迫农奴缴纳现款。“王府”里修补房屋、整治林卡等，都由农奴们自带口粮出乌拉，甚至雇用木匠和石匠的费用也都向农奴们摊派。在过去，参加修筑康藏、青藏公路等工程的农奴们出差归来，所得工资的全部或大部都被农奴主和管家们所没收。
  “山南王”的管家郎杰日久，曾经用从他的农奴那里没收来的两千多元银元，买了十头骡马。被榨取一空的农奴们在无法生活时往往逃亡他乡。在拉加里村，逃亡户占当地农奴总数的30％以上。没有逃亡的农奴们一贫如洗，生活极为悲惨。例如农奴吴根曲贞的一床破被子，已经几代人盖了九十五年。
    妄想永远保持反动农奴制度的“山南王”郎杰嘉措和他的兄弟，同西藏的其他反动大农奴主一起策动了叛乱。今年2月27日，他们在拉加里地区的贡康萨，召开了有山南地区二十多个宗的“代表”参加的“西藏独立国人民会议”，规定四十岁以下、二十岁以上的男子必须全部参加“卫教军”，以后又在“山南王”的“王府”里设立了“总指挥部”。但是，叛乱分子的好梦不长，人民解放军平叛部队很快就开始了向山南地区的进军，这一伙乌合之众顿时土崩瓦解。人民解放军和军管会工作队一到拉加里，立即访贫问苦，对贫苦的农奴先后救济和贷放了近千克粮食以及一部分酥油、茶叶，给缺少种子的农奴发放了两千多克农贷。部队官兵在两个月中就出了一万四千多个劳动日，帮助农民耕地、送粪、除草、浇水、修水渠等，使拉加里全县在叛乱平息后不荒一克土地。各部队的官兵们从帮助修房屋、修桥到背水、拾柴，从帮助治病、理发到改善卫生条件等，处处渗透了他们对藏胞的热爱，这更使藏胞们深深感动。
    现在，旧日的农奴已成了拉加里的主人。旧“王府”是当地驻军协助居民开办的一所小学的校址，学校里有一百四十五个学生。原来阴沉沉的旧“王府”里，不时响起孩子们“社会主义好”的歌声和欢笑声。渴望文化翻身的农奴们，目前已在拉加里全县办起了十多所民办小学。
    现在，拉加里全县已经成立了十一个农民协会筹备委员会。农奴们根据“谁种谁收”的政策，兴高彩烈地耕种着参加了叛乱的领主的土地。乌拉、高利贷、人头税等苛捐杂税全部废除了，“三反双减”的运动正在有步骤地开展起来。七十多岁的老农奴本仁见吉老妈妈，这样道出自己的心情：“拉加里的石头掀掉了，太阳照到我们的头上了。”
