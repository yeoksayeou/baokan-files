Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 31st.  A report from "Khuang Lao Patriotic News" in Xieng Khouang on July 27th states that Khamtay Siphandone, former deputy head of the military delegation of the Laotian Combat Forces who negotiated with the Lao Kingdom government in 1957, spoke at a mass rally in Xieng Khouang on July 26th, attended by the masses and former members of the Laotian Combat Forces. He commented on the joint communiqué signed between France and Laos, pointing out that it was a new step in the war plot of U.S. imperialism and a new step in the treasonous and harmful policies of the Sananikone-Katai group and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

Khamtay said that the joint communiqué, signed under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, was intended to openly transport more U.S. military personnel and weapons into Laos, allowing the United States to further control the Lao Kingdom army, intensify the expansion of the civil war in Laos, and turn Laos into a springboard for provoking and launching wars against neighboring countries.

He said that shortly after the signing of this joint communiqué, the United States continued to send a large number of senior military officers to Laos, instigating the Sananikone government to secretly sign bilateral agreements with the South Vietnamese and Thai authorities, attempting to transport more weapons and military equipment into Laos.

Khamtay said that recently, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Sananikone-Katai group and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," are intensifying two tasks: (1) enabling the U.S. advisors, military personnel, and weapons that have been transported into Laos in the past to exist openly and legally, and to strengthen military preparations to expand the civil war they have launched; (2) instigating their pawns to slander the former Laotian Combat Forces and other patriotic and peace-loving people under the banner of "anti-communism," and to carry out propaganda that distorts the facts, in order to intensify the suppression and persecution of large numbers of progressive and patriotic people. He said that at the same time, they are also launching hostile propaganda against neighboring countries that have consistently and firmly supported Laos' national liberation struggle and respected Laos' sovereignty and independence.

Khamtay said that they are attempting to eliminate patriotic and progressive forces in order to establish a militarist and fascist dictatorship, forcing the people to set up military bases for U.S. imperialism.

Khamtay emphasized, "Under these circumstances, we will resolutely fight to the end to save the Laotian nation, which is in dire straits, to defend our beloved motherland, and to build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos."

Khamtay said, we resolutely condemn the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to Lao and world opinion, and resolutely demand:

(1) U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government must respect and strictly implement the Geneva Agreements and Vientiane Agreements on Laos.

(2) Immediately stop the civil war launched by the Sananikone government.

(3) Withdraw all U.S. military advisors and personnel, as well as U.S. weapons, from Laos.

(4) Immediately stop retaliating against, arresting, persecuting, and assassinating members of the Lao Patriotic Front and all patriotic and progressive people in Laos. The democratic freedoms of the people and the right of the Lao Patriotic Front to carry out normal activities must be guaranteed.

(5) Immediately release the members of the Lao Patriotic Front and all patriotic and progressive people who are illegally imprisoned in the Kingdom's prisons. The freedom of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, including Prince Souphanouvong and other patriotic parliamentarians, must be fully restored.

Khamtay then said, "At the same time, we strongly condemn the French government, as a party to the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Indochina, for colluding with U.S. imperialism and the Lao Sananikone government to undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos. If the French government does not immediately abandon its policy of following the United States, it must bear part of the responsibility for the consequences of the Lao civil war."

Khamtay called on the governments of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as co-chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, and the governments of the member states of the Lao International Commission, to take urgent measures to restore the activities of the Lao International Commission and immediately stop the continuation of the Lao civil war.

    前寮国战斗部队领导人在群众集会上讲话
    谴责美国唆使老挝当局叛国殃民
    新华社河内31日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”7月27日报道，1957年曾经同老挝王国政府谈判的前寮国战斗部队军事代表团副团长坎代·西班顿7月26日在川圹群众和前寮国战斗部队共同参加的一个集会上就法国和老挝签订的联合公报发表讲话指出，这是美帝国主义战争阴谋的新步骤，是萨纳尼空一卡代集团和“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们的叛国殃民政策的新步骤。
    坎代说，在美帝国主义唆使下签订的这项联合公报是为了公开向老挝运进更多的美国军事人员和武器，让美国进一步控制老挝王国军队，加紧扩大老挝的内战，把老挝变成向邻国挑衅和发动战争的跳板。
    他说，这个联合公报刚签订不久，美国又继续向老挝增派大批高级军官，唆使萨纳尼空政府同南越和泰国当局秘密签订双边协定，企图把更多的武器和军事设备运进老挝。
    坎代说，最近，美帝国主义及其走狗萨纳尼空—卡代集团和“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们正在加紧进行两项工作：（一）使过去运进老挝的美国顾问、军事人员和武器能够公开和合法存在和加强军备，扩大他们所发动的内战；（二）唆使他们的爪牙打着“反共”的招牌大肆诬蔑前寮国战斗部队和其他爱国爱和平的人，并且进行歪曲事实的宣传，以便变本加厉地镇压和迫害大批进步和爱国人民。他说，他们同时还向一贯坚决支持老挝的民族解放斗争、尊重老挝的主权和独立的邻国发动敌对的宣传。
    坎代说，他们企图消灭爱国和进步力量，以便设立一个军国和法西斯的独裁制度，强迫人民为美帝国主义设立军事基地。
    坎代强调指出，“在这种情况下，我们将坚决战斗到底，以拯救处于水深火热中的老挝民族，保卫亲爱的祖国，以及建设和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。”
    坎代说，我们向老挝和世界舆论坚决谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋，并且坚决要求：
    （一）美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府必须尊重和严格履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    （二）立即停止由萨纳尼空政府发动的内战。
    （三）把所有的美国军事顾问和人员以及美国武器撤出老挝。
    （四）立即停止报复、逮捕、迫害、暗杀老挝爱国战线党成员和老挝一切爱国和进步人士。必须保证人民的民主自由权和老挝爱国战线党正常活动的权利。
    （五）立即释放被非法监禁在王国监狱里的老挝爱国战线党成员和一切爱国进步人士。必须完全恢复老挝爱国战线党的领袖的自由，其中包括苏发努冯亲王和其他爱国议员。
    坎代接着说，“我们同时严厉谴责作为签订1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的一方的法国政府同美帝国主义和老挝萨纳尼空政府勾结、破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议的行为。如果法国政府不立即放弃追随美国的政策，它就必须对老挝内战的后果负一部分责任。”
    坎代要求作为1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦会议两主席的苏联和英国政府以及老挝国际委员会的成员国的政府采取紧急措施，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，立即制止老挝内战的延续。
