　　The Shipyard by the Creek
　　Guo Feng
　　There are six tall palm trees growing in the broad open space in front of the shipyard.

　　In this mountain village by the creek, palm trees are planted in front of and behind every house and beside the earthen walls of the public dining hall. At the top of the palm trees, a large cluster of fan-shaped broad leaves sways gently in the wind.

　　A bright summer morning. Brilliant sunshine. Wisps of smoke rise from the roof of the village's public dining hall. Behind the village, the undulating mountains and lush forests seem to be exhaling a light blue haze.

　　The sound of metal being struck comes from the shipyard, crisp and melodious…. The mountain village shipyard, like many village houses here, has palm trees planted in front of it. No dry dock is seen, nor any cranes. Oh, the shipyard was just established during the Great Leap Forward last year. The village originally had three master shipbuilders. After everyone discussed it, the commune Party committee approved it, and several commune members who had learned a bit of carpentry from various production teams were transferred over. They then transformed the village's Lady Linshui temple, located by the creek, into a shipyard….

　　Since its establishment, how many wooden boats have been built in the mountain village shipyard? Are there small fishing boats for casting nets in the creek? Are there cargo ships with wide bodies and pointed ends? Can three-masted wooden ships be built? Is the ferry boat that crosses the creek also repaired and built here?

　　Walking down the gently sloping bank of the creek, all the way to the sandy beach covered with light yellow fine sand, there are two newly built wooden boats and one old wooden boat that has been repaired. On that sandy beach, eight or nine people are gathered around the wooden boats, some standing, some squatting. What are they talking about?

　　Look. On the bank of the creek, behind the palm trees of the shipyard, several people are carrying something over! Oh, oh, they are carrying a newly built wooden boat down along the bank of the creek; the people on the beach all rush forward to help them carry the wooden boat down, and together they help them place this new wooden boat alongside the three wooden boats... is this the place where the shipyard's boats are launched?

　　In front of the sandy beach, the green and clear water of the creek, like a rising tide, washes the sand.

　　Look. On the sandy beach, many people are pushing, pushing; some people are wading into the creek, pushing, pushing; the four wooden boats: three newly built wooden boats, and one just repaired wooden boat, are thus launched. They enter the stream. Some people jump onto the boats and use bamboo poles to punt; some people jump onto the boats and take the helm. Four wooden boats: three newly built wooden boats, and one just repaired wooden boat, form a fleet and sail in this green and clear creek….

　　Which commune has come here to order these wooden boats? Has the neighboring village’s production brigade come to order and entrust the repair of these wooden boats? The four wooden boats, one following another, form a fleet and sail in this creek. …

　　Without knowing when, many children from the village have also run over. They run back and forth on the sandy beach, clapping and cheering. A bright summer morning. Brilliant sunshine. From the roof of the village's public dining hall, wisps of smoke rise. In front of and behind the village houses, many palm trees, with large clusters of fan-shaped broad leaves at the top, sway gently in the wind, as if cheering for these newly launched boats, cheering for their first voyage….

　　溪边的造船厂
　　郭风
    有六棵高高的棕榈树，生长在造船厂前面的广阔空地上。
    在这临溪的山村，每一家的门前屋后和公共食堂的土墙边，都种植着棕榈树。棕榈树梢，一大丛扇形的宽大叶子，在风中轻轻地摇摆。
    仲夏的明朗的早晨。灿烂的阳光。村公共食堂的屋顶上升起袅袅的炊烟。村后，起伏的山峦，苍郁的森林，仿佛在吐着淡蓝的烟霭。
    造船厂里传来金属敲击的声音，清脆而悦耳……。山村的造船厂，它和这里的许多村屋一样，前面种植着棕榈树。没有看到船坞，也没有看到起重机。哦，造船厂是去年大跃进时，刚刚成立的。村里原来有三位造船的师傅，大家合计合计，公社党委批准，又从各生产小队里，调来几位学过一点木工的社员，便把村里临溪的那座临水娘娘的宫庙改造成为造船厂了……。
    山村的造船厂，从成立以来，这里已造出多少只木船呢？有那在溪中撒网捕鱼的小渔船吗？有那船身宽大、两端尖削的货船吗？能造出三桅的大木船吗？那过溪的渡船也是这里修造的吗？
    沿着慢慢倾斜的溪岸走下去，一直走到铺满浅黄色细纱的溪滩上，那里停放着两只新造的木船和一只已经修补好的旧木船。那溪滩上，有八九个人围着木船，有站着的，有蹲着的。他们在谈论着一些什么呢？
    看呵。溪岸上，从造船厂的棕榈树后面，好几个人抬着什么来了？哦，哦，他们抬着一只新造的木船沿着溪岸走下来了；在沙滩上的那些人，都涌上前去，一起帮助他们把木船抬下来，又一起帮助他们把这只新木船，和那三只木船安放在一块了……，这里是造船厂的船只下水的地方吗？
    沙滩前面，碧绿而清澈的溪水，好像刚刚涨潮的海水一般，冲刷着沙滩。
    看呵。溪滩上，许多人在推呵，推呵；有的人涉水站在溪中，在推呵，推呵；那四只木船：三只新造的木船，一只刚修补好的木船，便这样下水了。进入溪流中了。有人跳到船上，把竹篙撑着；有人跳到船上，掌起舵来。四只木船：三只新造的木船，一只刚修补好的木船，便结成队伍，在这碧绿而清澈的溪流中航行了……。
    是哪个公社到这里来订购这些木船呢？是邻村的生产大队来订购和委托修理这些木船吗？四只木船，一只跟上一只，在这溪流中，结成队伍航行了。……
    不知什么时候，村里的许多小孩子也跑来了。他们在溪滩上，跑来跑去，拍手欢呼，仲夏的明朗的早晨。灿烂的阳光。村公共食堂的屋顶上，升起袅袅的炊烟。村庄的门前屋后，许多棕榈树，树梢一大丛扇形的宽大叶子，在风中轻轻摇摆，好像在欢送这些新下水的船只，欢送它们的初次航行……。
