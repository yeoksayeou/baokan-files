Striving for a bumper harvest of coarse grains is a very important combat task in the current effort to achieve a bumper autumn harvest.

In our country, in addition to rice and wheat, there are also corn, sorghum, millet, barley, buckwheat, broad beans, etc., which are what we call coarse grains. At present, the planting area of coarse grain crops in the country accounts for 42% of the total planting area of grain crops, equivalent to the total planting area of rice and wheat. In northern regions, coarse grains are still the main food. In provinces and regions such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia, the planting area of coarse grains accounts for 80% of the total planting area of grain crops. In the four provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei, the planting area of coarse grains also accounts for 50% to 60% of the total planting area of grain crops. In rice-producing areas, the planting area of coarse grains such as corn, broad beans, and peas is also considerable. Even in Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," the planting area of coarse grains accounts for 40%; and in Zhejiang, a land of fish and rice, many coarse grains are also planted. Coarse grains are very nutritious. According to analysis by scientific research departments, the vitamin B content of millet is more than three times that of rice; the fat in sorghum rice is more than twice as much as that of rice. Many coarse grain producing areas are also high-yield grain areas. For example, the Liaodong area of Liaoning and the Jin Southeast area of Shanxi are high-yield crops of corn, sorghum, and millet. In the mountainous areas of Sichuan and Guangxi, corn yields are also very high.

Many coarse grains are high-yield crops, such as corn and sweet potatoes. Whether increasing yield per unit area or increasing total output, more coarse grains should be planted. The Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province has a total of ten counties (cities), five in the plains and five in the mountains. In terms of natural conditions, the five counties in the plains are much better than the five counties in the mountains, but the development of grain production in the plains lags behind the mountains. In the five mountainous counties, the average yield per mu in 1957 was 386 jin, an increase of 67.6% compared with 1952. The average yield per mu in the five plain counties was 354 jin, an increase of only 46.88% compared with 1952. There are, of course, many reasons, but the fact that the mountainous areas pay attention to planting more high-yield crops such as corn and sweet potatoes is one of the important reasons.

To develop livestock faster, a large increase in the production of coarse grains is also needed. Especially in the main coarse grain producing areas of Northeast, Northwest, and North China, the forage for large livestock is mainly the stalks of coarse grains. For example, millet straw is the best forage for large livestock, and corn stalks are ideal raw materials for making silage feed.

Therefore, to eat more grain and more pork, beef, and mutton, we must develop the production of coarse grains.

The sowing of coarse grains has passed. To strive for a bumper autumn harvest this year, the current key is to do everything possible to strengthen field management and increase yield per unit area. To strengthen field management, it is necessary to change the incorrect views of some people, such as the belief that coarse grains do not need the same meticulous field management as rice and wheat, and that they should be planted as much as possible and harvested as much as possible. This view is certainly wrong. The experience of the Great Leap Forward last year proved this point. The yield of well-managed fields differs from the yield of poorly managed fields by 50% to 100%.

In agricultural science, millet, corn, sorghum, etc. are listed as cultivated crops, which also shows that coarse grain crops need to carry out field management work centered on cultivation. This year, the growth of coarse grain crops is generally good, but some spring-sown coarse grains have had their sowing time delayed, and during the summer harvest season, labor was tight, and cultivation work was not done meticulously enough, so there are more weeds. After the summer harvest, the sowing of late coarse grain crops in some areas was also relatively rough, or because of continuous rain, weeds grew very quickly. Moreover, some areas did not remove weeds in time, resulting in varying degrees of weed infestation. This situation must be given close attention by all localities. Localities should immediately organize forces to eliminate weeds regularly in a combat-like posture, and at the same time do a good job of earthing up.

To do a good job of cultivating and weeding, labor must be properly arranged. If proper arrangements are not made, in the case of relatively tight labor, the cultivation and weeding of coarse grain crops will still be squeezed out. How to arrange it? Many places have gained preliminary experience. For example, Shangshui County in Henan Province organized a professional team for cultivation and fertilizer accumulation, which is specifically responsible for the cultivation of various autumn harvest crops, and implemented three guarantees and five fixings (fixing quality, fixing time, fixing reward methods, fixing labor quotas and work points). This not only alleviates the contradiction between more farm work and less labor, but also gives play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the commune members. Wen Shang County in Shandong Province, according to the situation of grass seedlings, first weeds those with more and taller grass and lakes and low-lying areas, and then weeds other areas, with good results. Different arrangements can be made in various places according to different circumstances. In short, it is necessary to ensure that someone is in charge of the work, that people have specific responsibilities, that responsibilities are clear, and that they are combined with each other. It is necessary to give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, and when necessary, organize large-scale cooperation between teams according to the principle of equivalent exchange, so as to quickly eliminate weeds.

Seizing the opportunity to apply fertilizer to coarse grain crops is a very important task at present. Many late coarse grains are planted in a rush, and generally the base fertilizer is insufficient, or some have not applied base fertilizer. If the top dressing is not grasped tightly, it will often fail to meet the needs of crop growth. At present, it is the vigorous growth period of coarse grain crops, and the size of the panicle depends on this period. It is an effective measure to strive for high yield for people's communes in various places to immediately apply fast-acting fertilizers to coarse grain crops as top dressing. Localities should immediately apply part of the fertilizer accumulated in the previous period to coarse grain crops as top dressing; at the same time, launch a fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production campaign to achieve simultaneous accumulation and application, so that coarse grain crops can be as fertile and well-watered as rice.

Summer is the period with the most diseases and insect pests in coarse grain crops. Aphids have begun to occur in sorghum in the Northeast, and corn borers have occurred in corn in Henan. There are also other various disasters. Failure to prevent and control these pests in time will seriously affect the harvest of coarse grains. It is necessary to immediately and extensively mobilize the masses and do everything possible to eliminate various insect pests. What is worth mentioning here is that some cadres have an incorrect view that there is no way to prevent and control diseases and insect pests without "foreign pesticides." This view is obviously wrong. For many years, our ancestors have relied on "native pesticides" and native methods to prevent and control various diseases and insect pests. Even in the Great Leap Forward last year, many places used "native pesticides" and native methods to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, thereby ensuring a bumper harvest.

August and September are also two months that determine the high yield of coarse grains. In these two months, if we grasp it tightly and do it well, it is entirely possible to increase the production of coarse grains by 10% to 30%. We must go all out, focus on the production of coarse grain crops in these two months, and oppose the negative attitude and slack emotions of "planting as much as you can and harvesting as much as you can." As long as we strengthen leadership, give full play to the superiority of the commune, rely closely on the masses, and work hard, practically, and cleverly, we will surely be able to strive for a bumper harvest of coarse grains this year.

### 力争杂粮大丰收

　　力争杂粮大丰收
    争取杂粮丰收，是当前争取秋季大丰收的一个很重要的战斗任务。
    我国的粮食作物，除水稻、小麦之外，还有玉米、高粱、谷子、大麦、荞麦、蚕豆等等，这些就是我们所说的杂粮。现在全国杂粮作物播种面积占全部粮食作物播种面积的42％，相当于水稻、小麦播种面积的总和。在北方地区，杂粮还是主要粮食。辽宁、吉林、黑龙江和内蒙古等省区的杂粮播种面积占全部粮食作物播种面积的80％，山西、山东、河南、河北四省的杂粮播种面积也占全部粮食作物播种面积的50％到60％。在水稻产区，玉米、蚕豆、豌豆等杂粮的种植面积也不少。号称“天府之国”的四川，杂粮的播种面积也占40％；鱼米之乡的浙江，也播种了许多杂粮。杂粮的营养十分丰富。据科学研究部门分析：小米所含的维生素乙，超过稻米三倍；高粱米中的脂肪，比稻米脂肪多两倍还多。有不少杂粮产区都是粮食的高产地区。如辽宁的辽东地区、山西的晋东南地区都是以玉米、高粱、谷子为高产作物。四川、广西的山区，玉米产量也很高。
    杂粮中有许多是高产作物，如玉米、红薯，等等。无论提高单位面积产量或增加总产量，都要多多种植杂粮。河北省唐山专区共有十个县（市），五个在平原，五个在山区。按自然条件来说，平原五个县比山区五个县优越得多，但是粮食生产的发展，平原却落在山区后边。山区五个县，1957年平均亩产三百八十六斤，同1952年比较，增长了67.6％。而平原五个县平均亩产三百五十四斤，同1952年比较，只增长了46.88％。原因当然很多，但是山区注意多种玉米、红薯等高产作物，是重要原因之一。
    要使牲畜发展得更快，也需要大量增产杂粮。特别是我国东北、西北、华北主要杂粮产区，大牲畜的饲草主要是杂粮的秸秆。例如谷草是大牲畜最好的饲草，玉米秆是制作青贮饲料的理想原料。
    因此，我们要吃到更多的粮食，吃到更多的猪肉、牛肉和羊肉，就要发展杂粮生产。
    杂粮的播种工作已经过去，为了争取今年秋季大丰收，当前的关键是千方百计加强田间管理，提高单位面积产量。要加强田间管理，一定要改变某些人的不正确的看法，如有人认为杂粮不需要像水稻、小麦一样细致的田间管理，种多少算多少，收多少算多少。这种看法当然是不对的，去年的大跃进的经验就证明了这一点，管理得好的产量与管理得不好的产量，相差50％到100％。
    在农业科学中，把谷子、玉米、高粱等列为中耕作物，也说明了杂粮作物需要开展以中耕为中心的田间管理工作。今年杂粮作物生长状况一般是良好的，但是也有一部分春播杂粮因为延迟了播种时间，夏收时节劳力紧张，中耕工作做得不够细致，杂草也就比较多。夏收以后，也有一部分地区晚杂粮作物播种比较粗糙，或者因为阴雨连绵，杂草长得很快。并且有部分地区没有及时除草，发生了不同程度的草荒现象。这种情况，必须引起各地严密注意。各地对杂粮作物要立即组织力量，以战斗的姿态，定期消灭杂草，同时作好培土工作。　
　要把中耕锄草工作做好，就要对劳力进行妥善的安排。如果不作妥善安排，在劳力比较紧张的情况下，杂粮作物的中耕锄草工作仍会被挤掉。如何安排呢？已有不少地方取得了初步经验。例如河南商水县组织了中耕积肥专业队，专门负责各种秋收作物的中耕工作，并实行了三包五定（定质量、定时间、定奖励办法、定劳动定额和工分）。这样做，不仅缓和了农活多和劳力少之间的矛盾，而且也发挥了社员的积极性和创造性。山东汶上县根据草苗情况，先锄草多草高的和湖洼低地，后锄其他地，效果很好。各地可根据不同的情况作不同的安排。总之，要作到活有人管，人有专责，责任分明，互相结合。要充分发挥人民公社的优越性，在必要时，按照等价交换的原则，组织队与队之间的大协作，以便迅速消灭杂草。　　抓紧对杂粮作物追施肥料，是目前一个非常重要的工作。许多晚杂粮是抢种的，一般基肥不足，也有的没有施基肥，如果追肥抓的不紧，也往往的不能满足作物生长的需要。而目前正是杂粮作物拔节盛期，穗子的大小，正取决于这个时期。各地人民公社立即给杂粮作物追施速效性肥料，是争取高产的有效措施。各地应该把前一个时期所积的肥料，分一部分立即给杂粮作物施追肥；同时，开展积肥造肥运动，做到边积边施，让杂粮作物像水稻一样肥足水饱。　　夏季是杂粮作物病虫害最多的时期。东北高粱开始发生蚜虫，河南玉米发生螟虫。还有其他各种灾害。不及时防治这些虫害，就要严重影响杂粮的收成。需要立即广泛地发动群众，千方百计地消灭各种虫害。这里值得特别提出来的，就是在一部分干部中有着一种不正确的看法，他们认为没有“洋农药”，就没有办法防治病虫害。这种看法显然是不对的。多少年来，我们的祖先就是靠“土农药”土办法防治各种病虫害的。就是去年的大跃进中，也有很多地方采用“土农药”土办法来防治病虫害，从而确保了大丰收。　　8、9月也是决定杂粮丰产的两个月。在这两个月中，抓得紧，抓得好，杂粮增产10％到30％，是完全可能的。必须鼓足干劲，大抓这两个月杂粮作物的生产，反对“种多少算多少，收多少算多少”的消极态度和松劲情绪。只要加强领导，充分发挥公社的优越性，紧紧依靠群众，苦干实干巧干，就一定能够争得今年杂粮大丰收。
