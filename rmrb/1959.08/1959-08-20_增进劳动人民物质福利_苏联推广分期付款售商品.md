Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th. The Soviet Union is promoting the method of selling goods on installment plans. This is a major measure to improve the material welfare of the working people.

Several months ago, stores specializing in selling goods on installment plans were opened in many cities in Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Based on the experience of these stores, the Soviet Council of Ministers recently passed a resolution to promote this method.

Goods available for installment payments include: radios, cameras, bicycles, motorcycles, sewing machines, clocks, and woolen and silk clothing, etc. Purchasers only need to pay 20% to 25% of the price upfront, with the remaining portion payable in six to twelve months.

Purchasers do not even need to go to the store to make payments; they only need to notify the factory or institution where they work to deduct the amount from their salary.

In the near future, specialized stores implementing installment payment methods will be established throughout the Soviet Union.

　　苏联推广分期付款售商品
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联正在推广分期付款出售商品的办法。这是增进劳动人民物质福利的一项重大措施。
    几个月前在乌克兰和俄罗斯联邦的许多城市，都开设了专门用分期付款办法出售商品的商店。根据这些商店的经验，苏联部长会议最近通过了推广这一办法的决议。
    分期付款的商品包括：收音机、照相机、自行车、摩托车、缝纫机、钟表，以及毛料和丝料衣服等。购买者只需先付20％到25％的现款，其余部分可以在六个月到十二个月中付清。
    购买者甚至不需要到商店中去付款，只要通知所在的工厂、机关从工资中扣除即可。
    在最近期间，苏联各地都要成立专门实行分期付款办法的商店。
