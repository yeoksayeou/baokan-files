Promptly Promote Advanced Experience
　　Lè Yúshí

　　Everyone knows that the Party's work is the lifeline of all work, and rural branches are the fighting fortresses and core leading forces for the Party to carry out various tasks in rural areas. Therefore, it is a very meaningful task for the Party's leading organs to summarize the advanced work experience of grassroots Party organizations in a timely manner and promote it on a larger scale. The CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee's recent promotion of the experience of the Shilipu branch throughout the district is a good example in this regard.

　　Promoting advanced experience is one of the leadership methods that our Party has always advocated. In theory, everyone should know the importance of this work, and it should be as simple as taking the advanced experience and promoting it. But actual life is not that simple. Although some advanced experience is already the product of objective existence, it cannot necessarily be taken and used at will. Before "taking and using" it, careful work must be done.

　　Currently, the work of grassroots Party organizations is generally very busy. In actual work, some grassroots Party organizations, although they have created some valuable experience, have not organized it in a timely manner and have been busy doing other work. The experience created is only scattered in the minds of some people. Some grassroots Party organizations may have also summarized their advanced experience, but limited by their ideological level, it is sometimes not systematic and profound enough. In this case, if higher-level Party organizations want to promote these advanced experiences, they must first carefully understand and study these experiences, and then help grassroots Party organizations to summarize them carefully. Only in this way can these advanced experiences be effectively promoted. To do this requires a lot of time. The fact that the Tianshui area spent so much effort to summarize the experience of some key branches shows that they fully understand the importance of the summarization work. Spending some time and manpower here will yield the corresponding rewards.

　　All advanced work experience is the product of actual work. Promoting these experiences can set an example for everyone, improve their own work, and raise the level of our entire work. People who create advanced experience are naturally ahead of others, but this is not because the road they take is particularly smooth, but because they have advanced ideas that others do not have. For example, in terms of mobilizing the masses, the masses in places that create advanced experience may not have been the most conscious masses originally, but because the grassroots Party organizations truly implemented the mass line and did meticulous ideological education work, the masses were mobilized and successfully completed the current work tasks. The masses in other places may not have been the least conscious masses originally, but because the grassroots Party organizations did not implement the mass line enough and did not do enough ideological work, the wisdom and energy of the masses were not fully utilized, which affected the current work. The key here is whether the grassroots Party cadres truly have the idea of ​​trusting and relying on the masses. In the process of promoting advanced experience, on the one hand, it is necessary to enable cadres of grassroots Party organizations to learn specific experience to improve their own work, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to enable cadres of grassroots Party organizations to establish advanced ideas and create their own experience in their work.

　　Things are constantly developing. After promoting one or several advanced experiences, more and more advanced experiences will be produced. Some of these experience creators are people who originally had advanced ideas and created advanced experiences, and in the new situation, they have enriched and improved their experience. Some may be people who were not originally advanced or even whose work was relatively backward, but after learning from advanced experience, they have created newer advanced experience based on their own conditions. In actual work, these new experiences have their new role. If higher-level Party organizations can concentrate these experiences in a timely manner, it will greatly enrich their leadership experience and more effectively guide actual work. At present, Party grassroots organizations in various regions have created some very good advanced experiences. It is hoped that the leading organs in various places, like the Tianshui Prefectural Committee, will concentrate these experiences well and promote them so that they can play the role of spark and yeast on a larger scale.

　　及时推广先进经验
　　乐于时
    谁都知道，党的工作是一切工作的生命线，农村支部是党在农村中进行各项工作的战斗堡垒和核心领导力量。因此，党的领导机关将基层党组织的先进工作经验及时总结起来，在更大范围内推广，是一件很有意义的工作。中共天水地委最近在全区范围内推广五十里铺支部工作的经验，就在这方面作出了一个榜样。
    推广先进经验，这是我们党历来所提倡的领导方法之一。从道理上说来，应当是人人都知道这个工作的重要性，只要将先进经验拿来推广就是，还有什么问题呢？不过，实际生活并不是这样简单，有些先进经验虽然已经是客观存在的产物，但并不一定可以随意伸手拿来。在“伸手拿来”之前，还须做一番仔细的工作。
    现在，基层党组织的工作一般说来都非常繁忙。在实际工作中，有些基层党组织虽然创造了一些可贵的经验，但没有及时整理起来，便忙着又干别的工作去了，所创造的经验只是点点滴滴遗留在一些人的脑海中。有些基层党组织也可能总结过自己的先进经验，但限于思想水平，有时还不够系统和深刻。在这种情况下，上层党组织要想推广这些先进经验，必须先来认真地了解和研究这些经验，然后再来帮助基层党组织细致地总结。只有这样，才能够有效地推广这些先进经验。要这样做，必须花费很多时间。天水地区花费了那样大的力量来总结一些重点支部的经验，说明他们完全理解了总结工作的重要。在这里花费一些时间和人力，是会取得应有的收获的。
    一切先进工作经验都是实际工作的产物，推广这些经验，就可以给大家树立一个榜样，改进自己的工作，将我们的整个工作水平提高一步。创造先进经验的人自然是走在别人的前面了，但这并不是由于他们走的道路特别平坦，而是因为他们具有别人所没有的先进思想。比如，以发动群众来说，创造先进经验地方的群众，原来未必都是觉悟最高的群众，但由于基层党组织真正贯彻了群众路线，作了细致的思想教育工作，群众发动起来了，出色地完成了当前的工作任务。别的地方的群众，原来也未必都是觉悟最差的群众，但由于基层党组织贯彻群众路线不够，思想工作做得不够，群众的智慧和干劲没有充分发挥出来，使当前的工作受到了影响。这里面的关键就在于：党的基层干部是否真正具有信任群众和依靠群众的思想。在推广先进经验中，一方面要使基层党组织的干部学习具体的经验，用来改进自己的工作，一方面也要使基层党组织的干部建立先进的思想，在工作中再来创造自己的经验。
    事物是经常发展的，在推广一种或几种先进经验之后，又会产生出更多更先进的经验。这些经验的创造者，有些是原来具有先进思想并创造先进经验的人，在新的情况下，又丰富和提高了自己的经验；有些可能是原来并不先进甚至工作比较落后的人，在学习了先进经验之后，根据自己的条件又创造出更新的先进经验。在实际工作中，这些新的经验都有它的新的作用。上级党组织如果能将这些经验及时集中起来，将会大大地丰富自己的领导经验，更有效地指导实际工作。现在，各个地区的党的基层组织都创造了一些很好的先进经验，希望各地的领导机关像天水地委那样，将这些经验很好地集中起来推广开去，使它在更大的范围内发生火花和酵母的作用。
