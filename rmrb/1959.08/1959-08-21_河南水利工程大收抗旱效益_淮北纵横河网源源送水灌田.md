Henan's Irrigated Area Reaches Over 60 Million Mu, with a New Expansion of 9 Million Mu
Northern Anhui's 20 Million Mu of Farmland Freed from Drought Threat, 7 Million Mu See Drought Relief

(Our Dispatch) For over a month, Henan Province has fully leveraged the benefits of existing water conservancy projects, irrigating over 66 million mu of land to combat drought. Simultaneously, it has renovated and newly constructed a large number of water conservancy projects in conjunction with the drought resistance effort, expanding the irrigated area by over 9 million mu. This has resulted in a tremendous victory in the struggle to resist drought and ensure a good harvest. The autumn crops that have been irrigated across the province are generally growing normally, and many areas have seen the phenomenon of "not being affected by drought despite the drought."

Since July, over 80 million mu of the province's 110 million mu of autumn crops have been threatened by drought. In the face of such severe drought conditions, the various water conservancy projects built throughout the province since liberation, particularly those constructed during the Great Leap Forward, have demonstrated their enormous effectiveness in combating drought and ensuring a good harvest. According to incomplete statistics, the various water conservancy projects used to irrigate autumn seedlings across the province include over 190,000 large and small canals, over 7,500 large, medium, and small reservoirs, over 680,000 wells of various types, and over 380,000 pits, ponds, weirs, and dams.

The 28 larger irrigation canals across the province and over 20 medium-sized irrigation canals along the Yi, Luo, Tang, and Bai Rivers have shown significant irrigation benefits, drawing a total of 990 cubic meters of water per second, irrigating 14 million mu of land. In particular, the Yellow River irrigation project has drawn the largest amount of water, drawing a total of 646 cubic meters of Yellow River water per second at its peak, irrigating 10.5 million mu of land. The seven large reservoirs and irrigation canals in the upper reaches of the Huai River basin have also played a significant role, irrigating 1.5 million mu of land, including 320,000 mu of autumn land in the Meishan Reservoir irrigation area, which has been universally irrigated once and has expanded the irrigation area by another 120,000 mu. The Baisha Reservoir releases 25.5 cubic meters of water per second, irrigating 550,000 mu of land. The extremely large number of water conservancy projects built under the guidance of the principle of "emphasizing storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community-run projects" have also played a significant role in combating drought. Jiyuan County, known for its comprehensive utilization of the Mang River's water resources, has utilized a total of 119 reservoirs, over 2,500 river canals, and over 5,000 wells, while also utilizing all ponds, cellars, springs, and other water conservancy projects, placing the county at the forefront of the province's drought resistance movement. The Wangwu Commune in this county irrigated a total of 10,500 mu of land in ten days, universally irrigating all 8,000 mu of its drought-stricken autumn seedlings once.

Water conservancy projects have ensured the victory of the drought resistance struggle, and the drought resistance struggle has greatly promoted the construction of water conservancy projects. In conjunction with the drought resistance struggle, the province has renovated and newly built over 170,000 canals, dug 240,000 wells, built 69,827 pits, ponds, weirs, and dams, and dug 80,000 artesian springs, expanding the irrigated area by over 9 million mu. In the struggle to resist drought and ensure a bumper harvest, the Xuegou People's Commune in Yu County launched a water conservancy construction movement of "not missing a mountain, conducting a comprehensive survey of slopes and gullies, intercepting rivers and digging springs, and returning every drop of water to the fields," expanding the irrigated area by 22,927 mu, equivalent to 43.7% of the irrigated area developed since liberation. The Minggao Commune in Yichuan County organized 800 laborers, working hard in the drought resistance effort, drilling through the Shipan Ridge, cutting off the Ma Liang Mountain, and crossing five gullies and six ridges, quickly building the 3,400-meter-long main canal and 4,400-meter-long branch canal of the Dougou medium-sized reservoir, and bringing water to the mountains, freeing 7,500 mu of autumn fields from drought.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest this autumn, resist drought to the end, and ensure the timely completion of wheat sowing, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest next summer, various localities are further vigorously renovating and newly building water conservancy projects, tapping water sources, striving to expand the irrigated area, and combining the current drought resistance movement with long-term water conservancy construction. The Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have also allocated 3,500 tons of cement, 300 cubic meters of timber, and 100 tons of steel, etc.; the water conservancy departments have dispatched thousands of technical personnel to support water conservancy construction in various localities.

(Our Dispatch from Hefei, August 20) The river network water conservancy projects in the Huai River region of Anhui Province have played a huge role in combating drought. Due to the sufficient water storage in the river network, 5 million mu of rice and 15 million mu of dry land have been freed from the threat of drought in the entire Huai River region, which has more than 40 million mu of cultivated land. Among the other 20 million mu affected by drought, over 7 million mu have also been irrigated to a certain extent by using river network water storage, as well as well and pond water, alleviating the drought situation.

As early as June this year, some areas of Funan, Yingshang, Fengtai, and Huaiyuan counties along the north bank of the Huai River experienced drought conditions. Since July, most areas of the Huai River region have received very little rainfall, and evaporation has greatly exceeded rainfall. For example, Funan County received only 1.9 mm of rainfall in July, and other areas only received 10-50 mm, which is 70%-99% less than the average rainfall in the Huai River region over many years (170-200 mm). If this situation had occurred in previous years, most areas would have suffered a severe drought. However, after two winters and springs of hard work, the people of the Huai River region have completed more than 10,000 river channels of levels one to six (level one river channels are 6 meters deep and 60 meters wide; level six river channels are 4 meters deep and 10 meters wide), excavated more than 120,000 ditches, built more than 20,000 culverts, sluices, and bridges, dug more than 120,000 wells, tapped 5,000 springs, built 80,000 ponds, and enclosed 6,000 weirs. These projects stored 3.2 billion cubic meters of surface water this spring, and added with the continuous supply of groundwater, they effectively ensured that more than 5 million mu of rice paddies and 15 million mu of dry crops were not severely threatened by drought. Only those areas in the Huai River region where the river network projects have not been fully completed are experiencing drought on nearly 20 million mu of land. However, even in these areas, over 7 million mu have been actively drawing water from river networks, wells, and ponds for irrigation in the drought resistance effort. After irrigating the above 27 million mu of land, the water level in the Huai River river network has only dropped by about 5 cm. Currently, the water storage in the river network is generally still 3-4 meters deep. It is estimated that if it does not rain by the end of August, the irrigation water source will still not be a problem. As long as the number of water lifting tools is increased, the irrigated area can still be expanded.

According to the plan, the Huai River region needs to complete 10 billion cubic meters of earthwork to fully realize river networkization. From the winter of 1957 to the present, 4.3 billion cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. It will still take two to three years of effort to complete the entire project. Areas that have achieved river networkization and areas that have basically achieved river networkization can ensure that there will be no flooding if it rains 400 mm at a time, and no drought if it does not rain for 70 days. For example, the Danqiao area in Linquan County, within 8.8 square kilometers (253,000 cubic meters of earthwork are excavated per square kilometer, reaching the river networkization standard), planted more than 1,800 mu of rice (the total cultivated area is more than 8,000 mu). In July, there was only 6.7 mm of rain, while in a typical year, the rainfall in July is around 200 mm. However, the river network water storage not only ensured the water use for rice but also ensured that all dry crops could be irrigated once every ten days. After nearly two months of water lifting irrigation, the river network water level only dropped by about 0.5 meters, and the water storage is still more than 3 meters deep. Another example is the Taomiao Township in Jieshou County. In the 12.7 square kilometer river network area (an average of 201,000 cubic meters of river network earthwork are excavated per square kilometer), a total of 1,237 mu of rice were planted. From July to early August, the rainfall was only 18.1 mm, and the evaporation was as high as 257.1 mm; water was drawn from the river network to irrigate all rice and dry land of more than 4,000 mu, and the water consumption only accounted for 17.6% of the river network water storage. Even in areas where the river network engineering has not reached the construction standard, certain results have been achieved. For example, in Liulin Township, Funan County, in an area of 24.6 square kilometers (an average of 156,000 cubic meters of earthwork are excavated per square kilometer), 6,180 mu of rice were planted. During the two months from June 6 to August 5, the rainfall was only 51.1 mm, and the evaporation during the same period reached 380.2 mm; water was drawn from the river network to irrigate all rice and dry crops of 9,280 mu, with a total water consumption of 2,436,000 cubic meters, accounting for 31% of the river network water storage.

In terms of flood prevention, in late July, Dingli Lake in Xiao County experienced a rainfall of 123 mm in one day. Without the river network project, it would have taken half a month for the water to recede; this year, because of the river network water storage, there was no water accumulation on the ground.

Seeing the huge superiority of the river network engineering in drought resistance and flood control, the broad masses of people in the Huai River region have become more determined in their thinking that "man will surely conquer nature," and not only are they going all out to fight the drought, but they are also determined to strive for the early realization of the entire river network engineering.

    河南水利工程大收抗旱效益  淮北纵横河网源源送水灌田
    河南抗旱浇地六千多万亩，新扩大灌溉面积九百万亩
    淮北二千万亩耕地摆脱干旱威胁，七百万亩旱情减轻
    本报讯　一个多月来，河南省充分发挥现有水利工程的效益，浇地抗旱六千六百多万亩，并结合抗旱整修新修了大量水利工程，扩大灌溉面积九百多万亩，取得了抗旱保收斗争的巨大胜利。全省得到灌溉的秋作物，一般生长正常，很多地区出现了“干旱不旱”的现象。
    7月份以来，在全省一亿一千多万亩秋田中，有八千多万亩受到了干旱威胁。在这样严重的旱情中，全省在解放后建成的各项水利工程，特别是在大跃进中兴修的水利工程，显示了抗旱保收的巨大效益。据不完全统计，全省灌溉秋苗使用的各项水利工程，有大小渠道十九万多条，大中小型水库七千五百多座，各种水井六十八万眼，坑塘、堰、坝三十八万多座。
    全省二十八个较大灌渠及伊、洛、唐、白河等沿河二十多处中型灌渠灌溉效益显著，共引水九百九十秒立方米，已浇地一千四百万亩。特别是引黄灌溉工程，引水量最大时共引黄河水六百四十六秒立方米，浇地一千零五十万亩。淮河流域上游的七座大型水库、灌渠，也大大发挥了作用，已浇地一百五十万亩，其中梅山水库灌区三十二万亩秋地已普遍浇一遍，并又扩大灌区十二万亩。白沙水库放水二十五点五秒立方米，浇地五十五万亩。在“以蓄为主，小型为主，社办为主”的方针指导下兴办的数量极多的水利工程，也在抗旱中发挥了重大作用。以综合利用漭河水利资源著称的济源县共利用水库一百十九座、河渠二千五百多条、水井五千多眼，同时利用了一切塘、窖、泉等水利工程，使全县抗旱进度站在全省运动的前列。这个县的王屋公社，十天内共浇地一万零五百多亩，将全社八千多亩干旱的秋苗普遍浇了一遍。
    水利工程保证了抗旱斗争的胜利，抗旱斗争也大大推动了水利工程的建设。结合抗旱斗争，全省已整修和新修渠道十七万多条，挖水井二十四万眼，坑塘堰坝六万九千八百二十七个，挖自流泉八万个，共扩大灌溉面积九百多万亩。禹县薛沟人民公社在抗旱保丰收的斗争中，开展了“一山不漏、坡沟普查，闸河挖泉、滴水归田”的边修边用的水利建设运动，扩大了灌溉面积二万二千九百二十七亩，相当于解放以来所发展的灌溉面积的43.7％。伊川县鸣皋公社组织了八百名劳力，在抗旱中大干苦干，钻透了石盘岭，截断了马良山，跨越了五道沟六道岭，迅速修通了陡沟中型水库的三千四百米长的干渠和四千四百米长的支渠，并把水引上了山，使七千五百亩秋田解除了干旱。
    为了确保今年秋季大丰收，抗旱抗到底，并保证适时完成麦播任务，为明年夏季大丰收打下基础，各地正在进一步大力整修和新修水利工程，挖掘水源，力争扩大灌溉面积，把当前抗旱运动与长期水利建设结合起来进行。河南省委和省人民委员会还调拨了三千五百吨水泥、三百立方米木材、一百吨钢材等；水利部门抽出上千名技术人员，支援各地兴修水利。
    本报合肥20日电　安徽省淮北地区的河网化水利工程，在抗旱中发挥了巨大的作用。由于河网蓄水充足，在全淮北四千多万亩耕地中，已有五百多万亩水稻和一千五百万亩旱地摆脱了干旱的威胁。其它受旱的二千万亩中，也有七百多万亩在一定程度上利用河网蓄水及井、塘水进行了浇灌，减轻了旱情。
    早在今年6月，沿淮河北岸的阜南、颍上、凤台、怀远等县部分地区就出现了旱情。7月以来，淮北绝大部分地区雨量极少，蒸发量大大超过降雨量。如阜南县7月份降雨只有一点九毫米，其他各地也只有十至五十毫米，比淮北多年的平均降雨量（一百七十至二百毫米）要少70％—99％。这种情况如发生在往年，绝大部分地区都要发生严重旱灾。但淮北人民经过两个冬春的苦战，已完成一至六级河道（一级河道深六米，宽六十米；六级河道深四米，宽十米）一万多条，开挖沟渠十二万多条，建涵闸桥梁二万多座，打井十二万多眼，下泉五千多眼，开塘八万多口，圈圩六千多处。这些工程在今年春季蓄地面水达三十二亿立方，另外加上源源不绝的地下水，就有效地保证了五百多万亩水稻田和一千五百万亩旱作物不受严重的干旱威胁。全淮北只有河网工程尚未彻底完成的地区，有近二千万亩田地受旱。但就在这些地区，也有七百多万亩在抗旱中积极引河网和井、塘水浇灌。淮北河网在浇灌以上二千七百多万亩土地后，水位仅仅降低五公寸左右。目前，河网蓄水一般还有三至四米深，估计如果到8月底不下雨，灌溉水源仍无问题，只要增加提水工具，还可增加浇灌面积。
    根据规划，淮北地区完全实现河网化需作一百亿土方，从1957年冬到目前，已作四十三亿土方，完成整个工程还需要经过两三年的努力。已经实现河网化的地区和基本实现河网化地区，已能作到在一次降雨四百毫米，不排不涝；七十天不下雨，不发生旱象。如临泉县单桥，在八点八平方公里内（每平方公里挖土方二十五万三千立方，达到了河网化标准），种水稻一千八百多亩（总耕地面积为八千多亩），7月份只下六点七毫米雨，而一般年份7月份下雨则在二百毫米左右，但是河网蓄水除了保证水稻用水外，还能保证所有旱庄稼十天浇灌一次。经过近两个月的提水灌溉，河网水位只下降零点五米左右，蓄水仍有三米多深。又如界首县陶庙乡，在十二点七平方公里的河网化地区（每平方公里平均挖河网土方二十万一千立方），共种水稻一千二百三十七亩，从7月至8月上旬，降雨量仅十八点一毫米，蒸发量则达二百五十七点一毫米；从河网中取水灌溉全部水稻和旱地四千多亩，用水量仅占河网蓄水量的17.6％。就是在河网化工程尚未达到施工标准的地区，也收到了一定的效果。例如阜南县柳林乡，在二十四点六平方公里的地区（平均每平方公里挖土方十五万六千立方），种水稻六千一百八十亩，从6月6日至8月5日两个月期间，仅降雨五十一点一毫米，同期蒸发量达三百八十点二毫米；从河网取水灌溉全部水稻及旱作物九千二百八十亩，共用水二百四十三万六千公方，占河网蓄水量的31％。
    在防涝方面，萧县丁里湖7月下旬曾一天降雨一百二十三毫米，如果没有河网化工程，积水需半个月才能退出；今年因为有了河网蓄水，所以地无积水。
    淮北广大人民看到河网化工程在抗旱、除涝中发挥了巨大的优越性，更加坚定了“人定胜天”的思想，不但鼓足干劲抗旱，而且决心要为提前全部实现河网化工程而奋斗。（附图片）
