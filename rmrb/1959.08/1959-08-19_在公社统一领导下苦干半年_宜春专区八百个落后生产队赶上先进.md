　　After Half a Year of Hard Work Under the Unified Leadership of the Commune
　　800 Backward Production Teams in the Yichun Special District Catch Up with the Advanced
    (Our Dispatch) The Yichun Special District in Jiangxi Province has 1,358 production brigades with weak economic foundations. Under the unified leadership of the People's Commune, after half a year of hard work, 825 production brigades have approached or caught up with the level of advanced teams.
    These production brigades with weak economic foundations generally had bumper harvests of early rice this year, with average yields per mu increasing by 40% to 100% compared to last year. With the comprehensive development of other diversified operations, the average income per commune member is expected to double compared to last year, approaching or catching up with the local production teams with better economic foundations.
    These teams with relatively weak economic foundations are generally located in remote areas with barren land and relatively weak leadership from cadres. After comprehensively investigating the situation of these teams and identifying methods to change the face of backward teams, Party organizations at all levels dispatched a large number of cadres to strengthen the leadership of these production teams. A total of 2,475 cadres were transferred throughout the district to serve as branch secretaries or other leading positions in these teams. In addition, the state and the commune provided strong economic assistance. The district allocated more than 7.2 million yuan to help production teams with weak economic foundations develop production, and also provided appropriate consideration to these teams in terms of purchasing local specialties, taxation, and public accumulation.
    Thanks to the active leadership of the commune Party committee, each production brigade with a weak economic foundation established a spirit of self-reliance and hard work, overcoming the inferiority complex and dependence mentality of some people who believed that poor natural conditions and a weak production work foundation made it impossible to catch up with advanced areas. In Wanzai County, the Baita Brigade of the Gaocheng Commune launched a campaign to accumulate fertilizer and transform low-yield fields, with men and women, young and old, mobilizing together and working hard day and night. Communist Youth League member Guo Lin and led eight young people to set up camp in the deep mountains twenty miles away to burn thatch ash. Elderly grandfathers and grandmothers got up early and searched for wild manure late into the night. In the past, the Liuyuan Brigade of the Futian Commune in Pingxiang County had very poor water conservancy conditions, with 80% of the fields suffering from drought, resulting in reduced production or crop failure year after year. Through the efforts of the commune members, various difficulties were overcome, and more than 70 large and small ponds were built, solving the problem of water shortage and turning the area into a place free from drought and flood worries, resulting in a bumper harvest of early rice.
    When leading these teams with relatively poor economic foundations to arrange this year's production, the People's Commune emphasized that in addition to actively increasing grain production, efforts must also be made to develop diversified operations. The Gejia Brigade of the Dongfanghong Commune in Yichun County has vigorously developed "five industries" (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery) in the past six months, with significant results. The entire team has already raised 110 pigs, with a plan to complete 300 by the end of the year, increasing poultry from 100 last year to 1,544, burning 310,000 bricks and tiles, planting 30 mu of vegetables, and producing 40,000 to 50,000 jin of vegetables to support the cities. The Youxi Brigade of the Daqiao Commune in Wanzai County, while striving for multiple harvests in agriculture, has vigorously engaged in diversified operations. From April to now, they have earned a total of 4,790 yuan from growing vegetables, making bamboo hats, digging medicinal materials, and raising livestock and poultry, with an average income of 34.7 yuan per household.

### 在公社统一领导下苦干半年　宜春专区八百个落后生产队赶上先进

　　在公社统一领导下苦干半年
　　宜春专区八百个落后生产队赶上先进
    本报讯　江西宜春专区一千三百五十八个经济基础薄弱的生产大队，在人民公社的统一领导下，经过半年来的苦战，已有八百二十五个生产大队接近或赶上了先进队的水平。
    这些经济基础薄弱的生产大队，今年早稻普遍丰收，一般亩产都比去年增长40％以上至一倍。加上其它多种经营的全面发展，社员每人平均收入可比去年增加一倍左右，接近或赶上了当地经济基础较好的生产队。
    这些经济基础较薄弱的队，一般都是地区偏僻，土地贫瘠，干部领导力量比较薄弱。各级党组织在全面调查了这些队的情况，找出了改变落后队面貌的方法后，派了大批干部，加强了这些生产队的领导。全区共抽调了二千四百七十五名干部到这些队去担任支部书记或其他领导工作。此外，国家和公社在经济上给予了有力扶助。全区共拨出七百二十多万元帮助经济基础薄弱的队发展生产，在收购土特产、税收、公共积累等方面，对这些队也给予了适当照顾。
    各个经济基础薄弱的生产大队由于得到公社党委的积极领导，树立了自力更生，奋发图强的精神，克服了某些人认为自然条件差，生产工作基础差，无法赶上先进地区的自卑情绪和依赖思想。万载县高城公社白塔大队在开展积肥改造低产田中，男女老少齐动员，日夜苦干。团员郭林和带领八个青年到二十里以外的深山里安营扎寨烧茅灰。年老的公公和婆婆起早摸夜拣野粪。萍乡县福田公社柳沅大队过去水利条件很差，有80％的田受旱，年年造成减产或失收。经过社员的努力，克服了各种困难，兴修了大小水塘七十多口，解决了缺水的问题，变成了水旱无忧的地方，早稻得到丰收。
    人民公社在领导这些经济基础较差的队安排今年的生产时，十分强调除了积极增加粮食生产外，还须努力发展多种经营。宜春县东方红公社葛家大队半年来大兴“五业”（农林牧副渔），效果显著。全队已养猪一百一十头，计划到年底完成三百头，家禽由去年一百只增至一千五百四十四只，烧砖瓦三十一万块，种上了蔬菜三十亩，生产了四、五万斤蔬菜支援了城市。万载县大桥公社尤溪大队在力争农业多种多收的前提下，大搞多种经营，自4月到现在，种蔬菜，做斗笠，挖药材，饲养家畜家禽等共收四千七百九十多元，每户平均收入达三十四元七角。
