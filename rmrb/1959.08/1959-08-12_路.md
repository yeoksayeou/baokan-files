    Roads are made by people walking. In places where there were no roads originally, the more people walk, the more roads there will be. This is the "road" that Lu Xun once pointed out to us. This is the revolutionary's view of "road." To reform and create, there will be no ready-made roads; at the very least, there will be no smooth, broad roads.
    In many places, there are some "low-yield areas." There is a distance to go from low-yield to high-yield. However, no matter how far the distance, there is always a road to be found. Even if there is no road, as long as we walk, we can always forge a path. Here, we must first have the spirit of cutting through thorns and brambles, and dare to move forward. We must believe that "roads are made by people, success depends on human effort," and not believe that "planning is up to people, but success is up to Heaven." In many "low-yield areas," the production conditions are indeed very difficult. Like the Chuzhen Brigade of Chujiangwei Commune in Lingling County, Hunan, introduced on the third page of yesterday's People's Daily, it is full of barren mountains and ridges, full of mountain terraces, and the soil quality is also very poor, so the yield has always been very low. The situation is the same in some communes and teams in Changsha County introduced today. For example, more than 1,000 mu of land in the Dongyang Brigade of Qiaoyi Commune are scattered in more than 180 mountain gullies, where "the sun can only be seen at noon," and most of them are sandy fields. However, the comrades of these teams, full of confidence and energy, used their own hands and wisdom to overcome numerous difficulties and opened up a road to "high yield," moving from "low yield" to "high yield" in a few months, and are now confidently moving towards "even higher yield."
    To walk out a road from a place where there is no road, of course, is not to dash around aimlessly on the vast land. To walk well and walk fast, we must not only be able to distinguish directions, but also strive to understand what situations we might encounter in the places we need to pass through. If there are "thorns and brambles," we must find ways to "cut" them. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid being pricked. If we want to grasp the situation, we can send scouts to reconnoiter in advance, or we can inquire from people who have passed through these places in the past. The comrades of the Chuzhen Brigade made a careful study of the local natural conditions. They found a small piece of land that had been transformed from low-yield to high-yield in the past, and analyzed the reasons for the transformation from low-yield to high-yield. Based on these materials, they designed a broad road to high yield. Not only was the direction clear, but they also knew more clearly how to open up this broad road.
    Of course, the most important thing is to "walk." Correct understanding must be followed by correct action.
    If we don't "walk," we will not have a more detailed and accurate understanding of the situation on the road to be opened. If we walk past, walking along, we can find better ways to open the road, and our confidence will be strengthened.
    If we don't "walk," even if others have already walked ahead and opened up a road, we will still stay where we are, or even retreat. Didn't some teams in Changsha County, which originally had higher yields, reduce their production by several percent just because they relaxed their efforts and stopped moving forward actively?
    Roads must be walked. If a road that already exists is not walked on, over the years, it will be overgrown with weeds and there will be no road again.

    路是人走出来的。在原先没有路的地方，走的人多了，也就有了路。——这就是鲁迅曾经给我们指出的“路”。这是革命者对“路”的看法。要改革，要创造，就不会有现成的路；至少，不会有平坦的大路。
    在不少地方，都有一些“低产区”。由低产到高产，有一段距离。可是，距离再远，总有道路可通。即使没有路，只要走，总能踏出一条路来。在这里，首先得有披荆斩棘的精神，要敢于前进。要相信“路在人走，事在人为”，而不要相信“谋事在人，成事在天”。有不少“低产区”，生产条件的确是非常困难的。像昨天人民日报第三版介绍的湖南零陵县楚江圩公社楚镇大队，尽是秃山秃岭，尽是山地梯田，土质也很坏，产量一向很低。今天介绍的长沙县的一些社和队也是这样。如桥馹公社洞阳大队的一千多亩田就分散在一百八十多条山沟里，“中午方能见太阳”，而且大都是沙子田。可是，这些队的同志们信心十足、精力充沛地用自己的双手和智慧，战胜重重困难，开辟了走向“高产”的道路，几个月之间就由“低产”走到了“高产”，又满怀信心地走向“更高产”。
    从没有路的地方走出路来，当然不是在茫茫大地上漫无目的地横冲直撞。要走得好、走得快，既要能辨别方向，又要力求了解在需要经过的地方可能碰到什么情况。有“荆棘”，就要找出办法来“斩”它。不然，就难免要被它刺疼。想要掌握情况，可以事先派尖兵侦察，也可以向过去经过这些地方的人探询。楚镇大队的同志们对于当地的自然条件是作了仔细研究的。他们找到了过去的一小片由低产变高产的田，分析了低产变高产的原因。根据这些材料，设计了一条通向高产的大路。不但方向明确了，而且比较清楚地知道了怎样开辟这条大路。
    当然，最重要的还是“走”。正确的认识之后必须继之以正确的行动。
    不“走”，对于要开辟的道路上的情况也就不会有更详细更确切的认识。走过去，走着走着，就能找出开路的更好的办法来，信心也就更加坚定了。
    不“走”，即使别人已经走在前面开辟了一条路，自己也还是会停留在原地，甚至会后退。长沙县不是有些本来产量较高的队，只因为松了劲，不再积极向前走，就减产了几成吗？
    路必须走。已经有了的路，如果不走，经年累月，就会长满荒草，又没有了路。
