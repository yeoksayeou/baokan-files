Beijing's Food Industry Displays Hygiene Red Banner
    Hongxing Restaurant is Clean, Efficient, and Customers are Satisfied

    (Our Reporter Liu Peihang) The hygiene work of Beijing's Tianqiao Hongxing Restaurant has now become a hygiene red banner for the city's food industry. Since the beginning of summer, hygiene departments and service industries from Beijing and other provinces and cities have come to visit. The Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Service Bureau also jointly held a city-wide on-site meeting on food hygiene here.

    Eliminating Disease Transmission Conditions, Ensuring Customer Health

    This is an ordinary restaurant, and the equipment conditions are not very good. However, the service personnel and cooks in the restaurant all pay attention to hygiene. Under the slogan of "Doing a good job in hygiene, ensuring the health of customers," they ensure that tables, chairs, and floors are cleaned and scrubbed at any time, and the chopping boards, knives, spoons, and other utensils are also scrubbed clean. It is difficult to find flies indoors. Hand washing facilities are provided for customers at the entrance of the restaurant. In order to prevent disease transmission, the employees of this restaurant do everything possible to pay attention to hygiene according to the characteristics of the catering industry. When two or three customers come to eat together, in addition to the chopsticks and spoons for each person's own use, public chopsticks and spoons are also provided. Separate tableware is prepared for sick customers. Each piece of used tableware is subjected to four processes: washing with alkaline water, washing with clean water, and boiling disinfection. The kitchen has fly-proof equipment, and the items are placed neatly and orderly. The seasonings used for cooking are placed in iron covers, and the rolling pins and stuffing spoons are placed in cloth bags. Cutting boards and other tools have dust-proof equipment. In order to ensure food is clean, they implement a "four nots" system from raw materials such as meat and vegetables to making food, that is, rotten vegetables are not bought by purchasing staff, not accepted by inspectors, not made by cooks, and not sold by service staff. The green vegetables in the warehouse are placed on ventilated shelves, and the dried and fresh goods are placed in jars with lids. Soy sauce and vinegar are filtered before use. Vegetables are carefully selected and washed many times. Cucumbers are brushed with small brushes, and cold dishes are also disinfected. They ensure that they never sell rotten or deteriorated food, and disinfection is thorough, ensuring that every plate of dishes is clean and every bowl of rice is clean. The results of the examination of the restaurant's utensils, tableware, and cold dishes by medical personnel from the Xuanwu District Epidemic Prevention Station confirmed that they all meet the requirements of food hygiene and no Escherichia coli was found.

    Debate if Unclear, Act if Clear, Party Organization Leads Deeply and Specifically

    The customers of Hongxing Restaurant are mostly workers and peasants. It receives an average of two to three thousand people every day, and even more customers on Sundays or holidays. Why is the hygiene work of this old house with ordinary equipment done so well? First of all, through the method of "debate if unclear, act if clear," all employees ideologically realized the relationship and great significance of food hygiene work to the health of the broad masses of people. The disinfection team in the restaurant had not been thoroughly disinfecting tableware in the past. Most of this team were elderly people in their sixties. They believed that there were too few tableware and too many customers, and they couldn't even finish brushing, so how could they have time to disinfect. The Party organization seized this ideological situation and organized everyone to jointly debate issues such as "Why should we thoroughly improve food hygiene?" and "Can hygiene work be regularized?" During repeated discussions, some people were also organized to observe bacteria under a microscope, and they saw that there were indeed a large number of living bacteria on tableware that had not been thoroughly disinfected. This gave the employees a profound education and clarified the close relationship between food hygiene work and the health of the broad masses of people. An old worker who used to think that it was impossible to thoroughly improve hygiene said: "We receive thousands of people here every day. If hygiene is not done well, how much harm will it bring to the health of thousands of people! We must do a good job in hygiene to ensure the health of our employees, which is equivalent to us building socialism." After the debate and observation of bacteria, the disinfection team immediately proposed to thoroughly disinfect tableware, and challenged the stir-fry team, noodle team, and service team. Other teams also responded one after another. In this way, the hygiene work of the restaurant was promoted. After initial success in hygiene work, some employees developed complacency and thought that the hygiene work was almost done. The Party branch promptly organized them to discuss, overcome complacency, and continuously improve the quality of hygiene work.

    Establish a Regular Hygiene System, Staff Take the Lead

    After a new atmosphere appeared in the restaurant's hygiene work, the next question was how to move from a crash program to regular hygiene work. They seized the link of formulating a hygiene system to consolidate the achievements already made in hygiene work. In addition to universally formulating regulations on environmental hygiene work, staff members have all formulated regulations according to their work characteristics. For example, service personnel have formulated regulations such as filtering soy sauce and vinegar when used, and wiping the tabletop clean at any time. The staff who make pasta ensure that the cages and cutting boards used are not distinguished between top and bottom, and are brushed once a day. The cooks who stir-fry stipulate that they check the goods every day to ensure that they do not make rotten or deteriorated food, and large vats and cutting boards for cutting vegetables and meat are disinfected once a day, and covered with sleeves. The person in charge of the warehouse implements a system of dedicated personnel to be responsible for the acceptance and inspection of chicken, shrimp, fish, meat, green vegetables, etc. to ensure that food does not rot. In addition, they have also formulated dormitory and personal hygiene regulations. Such as washing hands and disinfecting before work, frequent bathing, haircuts, shaving, and trimming nails. In order to conscientiously implement the hygiene system, a joint inspection system was established by the Party, the Communist Youth League, the administration, and the trade union. A comprehensive inspection is conducted once a week, and an evaluation is conducted every half month. In the process of implementing these hygiene systems, service personnel and other staff have gradually developed good hygiene habits, which also ensures the health of the staff. In previous years, the staff of this restaurant often got sick in the summer, but since the beginning of summer this year, no one has been sick, and the attendance rate has reached 99%.

    Seek Teachers and Visit Friends to Learn Good Experiences, Patiently Conduct Propaganda to Customers

    The restaurant also adopted the method of "seeking teachers and visiting friends to learn advanced experience" to continuously improve the level of food hygiene work. They have successively visited some large, medium and small restaurants, hotels and other units with advanced hygiene in Beijing to learn, and combined with the situation of their restaurant, absorbed the advanced hygiene work experience of other units. They learned the experience of "diligence" from the Beijing Hygiene Red Banner unit - Sanyuan Hotel. The service staff are diligent with their hands, always keeping the tabletop clean, and the tableware is cleaned up as soon as it is used. The disinfection staff also disinfect as soon as they arrive, which is both hygienic and solves the contradiction between few tableware and many customers. When visiting Fengzeyuan Restaurant, they learned the experience of sealing the gaps in the handles of knives and stir-fry spoons with tin to prevent the accumulation of oil stains, and adding sleeves to the piers to prevent dust and keep them clean. They also invited medical personnel from the district epidemic prevention station to give lectures on hygiene knowledge and strive to improve hygiene work.

    To thoroughly improve the hygiene of the food industry, customers should also assist the restaurant staff in conducting it together. In order to cultivate the hygiene habits of customers, they pay special attention to hygiene propaganda activities. Eye-catching horizontal banners are posted in the restaurant: "Thoroughly eliminate mosquitoes and flies, do not eat rotten and deteriorated food, prevent disease transmission." Slogans such as "Please wash your hands before meals" are also posted on the walls in combination with beautification. When customers enter the door, the service staff always tell customers where the hand washing pool is, and also promote the benefits of using public chopsticks and spoons. And mobilize sick customers to use special tableware. Their patient publicity has achieved very good results. Some sick guests take the initiative to ask the service staff for special tableware.

    The staff of this restaurant are not satisfied with the existing achievements. They will further take more effective measures to improve food hygiene, not only to be clean and ensure the health of customers, but also to make the dishes palatable and increase nutrition for customers.

    北京市饮食行业出现卫生红旗  
    鸿兴饭馆干净利落顾客满意
    本报讯　记者刘佩珩报道：北京天桥鸿兴饭馆的卫生工作现已成为全市饮食行业的卫生红旗。入夏以来，北京市和其他省、市的卫生部门、服务性行业陆续来参观，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会和服务局也在这里联合召开了全市饮食卫生现场会。
    消除疾病传染条件  保证顾客身体健康
    这是一个普通的饭馆，设备条件并不很好。但是，饭馆里的服务人员和炊事员人人注意卫生，在“搞好卫生，保证顾客身体健康”的口号下，做到了桌椅、地面等处随时打扫擦洗，案板、刀、勺等用具也都刷洗得干干净净，室内很难发现苍蝇。饭馆入口处为顾客准备了洗手设备。这个饭馆的职工为防止疾病传染，按照饮食行业的特点，千方百计地讲究卫生。当两、三位顾客一起来吃饭时，除每人自用的筷、匙外，还备有公筷和公匙。为有病的顾客单准备了餐具。用过的餐具每件都分别经碱水洗、清水洗和煮沸消毒等四道工序。厨房里有防蝇设备，物品放置整齐有序，炒菜用的调料都放在铁罩里，擀面杖，馅匙子都装在布口袋里，切菜墩子、案子等各种工具都有防尘设备。他们为保证食品清洁，从肉食蔬菜等原材料到作成食品，实行“四不”制度，即腐烂的菜采购员不买，验收员不收，炊事员不做，服务员不卖。库房里的青菜放在通风架上，干鲜货都装缸加盖，酱油、醋经过滤后才用。蔬菜细择多洗，黄瓜用小刷子刷，凉拌菜时还要消毒，他们作到从不出售腐烂变质食品，消毒彻底，保证盘盘菜干净，碗碗饭清洁。宣武区防疫站的医务人员对这个饭馆用具、餐具和凉菜等进行化验的结果证实，全部合乎饮食卫生的要求，没有发现大肠杆菌。
    不明就辩辩明就干  党组织领导深入具体
    鸿兴饭馆的顾客，大部是工农劳动人民，每天平均接待二、三千人，星期天或假日的顾客更多。这个房屋陈旧、设备一般的饭馆，为什么卫生工作做得这样好呢？他们首先通过“不明就辩，辩明就干”的方式，使全体职工思想上认识到饮食卫生工作对广大人民身体健康的关系和重大意义。饭馆里的消毒组过去一直对餐具消毒不彻底。这个组大部是六十多岁的老年人，他们认为餐具少、顾客多，光刷都刷不过来，还哪有功夫消毒。党组织抓住这种思想情况，组织大家共同辩论“为什么要彻底搞好食品卫生”和“卫生工作能不能作到经常化”等问题，在反复讨论中又组织了一些人观察显微镜下的细菌，看到消毒不彻底的餐具上确有大量活的细菌存在。这样使职工们受到深刻的教育，明确了饮食卫生工作对广大人民身体健康的密切关系。有一位过去认为无法彻底搞好卫生的老工人说：“每天我们这里要接待几千人，卫生搞不好会对几千人健康带来多大的危害！我们要搞好卫生，保证职工们的身体健康，也等于我们建设了社会主义。”经过辩论和对细菌进行观察后，消毒组立即提出要做到餐具等彻底消毒，并向炒菜组、面案组、服务组等各组挑战。其他各组也纷纷响应。这样，就把这个饭馆的卫生工作都带动起来了。在卫生工作取得初步成绩以后，有的职工产生了自满情绪，认为卫生工作搞的差不多了。党支部又及时组织他们进行了讨论，克服了自满情绪，不断提高了卫生工作的质量。
    建立经常卫生制度  工作人员以身作则
    饭馆里的卫生工作出现一番新气象以后，紧接着的问题是如何使卫生工作从突击走上经常化。他们抓住了制订卫生制度这一环，巩固卫生工作已取得的成绩，工作人员除普遍订出有关环境卫生工作制度外，都按工作特点订出了制度，如服务人员订出酱油、醋用时过滤和桌面随时擦洗干净等制度。做面食的人员做到所用笼屉和案板等用具不分上下，每天刷洗一次。炒菜的炊事员规定每天检查商品，保证不做腐烂变质食品，大缸和切菜、肉用的墩子每天消毒一次，还加盖封套等。管仓库的人实行专人负责，对鸡虾鱼肉、青菜等进行验收和检查，保证食物不腐不烂。此外，他们还制定了宿舍和个人卫生制度。如工作前洗手消毒，经常洗澡、理发、刮脸、剪指甲等。为了认真执行卫生制度，由党团和行政、工会建立了联合检查制度，每周全面检查一次，半月进行评比。在执行这些卫生制度过程中，服务员和其他工作人员逐渐养成了良好的卫生习惯，也保证了职工的身体健康。往年夏天这个饭馆职工常有生病的，今年入夏到现在没有一个人患病，出勤率达99％。
    寻师访友学习好经验  耐心向顾客进行宣传
    这个饭馆还采取了“寻师访友，学习先进经验”的办法，不断提高饮食卫生工作的水平。他们已先后到北京市一些大中小型饭馆、旅馆等卫生先进的单位参观学习，并结合他们饭馆的情况，吸取别的单位的先进卫生工作经验。他们从北京市卫生红旗单位——三元客店学习了“勤”的经验，服务人员作到手勤，随时保持桌面清洁，餐具用过随时收拾，消毒的工作人员也作到随到随洗随消毒，这样既卫生，又解决了餐具少，顾客多的矛盾。参观丰泽园大饭店时，他们学习刀柄、炒勺柄的缝隙容易积存油污的地方用锡焊住缝口，墩案加套防尘保洁等项经验。他们还请区防疫站医务人员讲卫生知识，努力改进卫生工作。
    饮食行业的卫生要搞彻底，也要顾客协助饭馆工作人员共同进行。他们为了培养顾客的卫生习惯。特别注意卫生宣传活动。饭馆迎面贴出引人注意的横字标语：“彻底消灭蚊蝇不吃腐烂变质食品防止疾病传染”。墙壁上结合美化还贴有饭前请洗手等标语。当顾客进门时，服务员随时告诉顾客洗手池的地方，同时也宣传使用公筷、公匙的好处。并动员有病的顾客使用专用食具，他们这样耐心地宣传，已取得很好的效果，有些患病的客人主动地向服务员要专用食具。
    这个饭馆的职工并不满足已有的成绩，他们要进一步采取更有效的措施来改进饮食卫生，不仅要做到清洁，确保顾客的健康，还要使饭菜吃的适口，为顾客增加营养。（附图片）
