　　Unappreciative
    When U.S. Vice President Nixon visited the Soviet Union, he tried his best to put on a friendly appearance, shouting "Peace, friendship" everywhere in Russian. But a few days after he returned to the United States, he talked about "strength" again in English, and deliberately poured cold water on the upcoming mutual visits of the Soviet and American government leaders. In a recent television conversation, Nixon even used the courtesy he received in the Soviet Union to slander the Soviet Union, saying that the "very, very friendly reception" he received from the Soviet people proved that Soviet propaganda about the United States had failed. This is really strange logic.
    The Soviet people, because they support the government's peaceful foreign policy of striving to improve relations with the United States, treated Nixon, as a representative of the U.S. government, with courtesy. This precisely shows the sincerity of the Soviet government and people for peaceful coexistence. And when the Soviet people received Nixon in a friendly manner, they also raised many serious questions to him, because the Soviet people hoped that the United States would change its unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union.
    However, Nixon deliberately distorted the good intentions of the Soviet government and people, using this to slander Soviet policies. It seems that this vice president, who is used to being pelted with tomatoes and potatoes, is unappreciative.

　　不识抬举
    美国副总统尼克松在苏联访问的时候，极力装出一副友善的姿态，到处用俄语呼喊“和平，友好”。但是他回到美国没几天，就又用英语大谈“实力”，对苏美政府首脑即将举行的互相访问，也故意泼冷水。在最近一次电视谈话中，尼克松甚至把他在苏联受到的礼遇拿来对苏联进行诬蔑，说什么他受到苏联人民“非常非常友好的接待”，证明苏联关于美国的宣传失败了。这真是奇怪的逻辑。
    苏联人民因为拥护政府争取同美国改善关系的和平外交政策，所以对作为美国政府代表的尼克松以礼相待，这正表明苏联政府和人民对和平共处的诚意。而在苏联人民友好接待尼克松的时候，同时也对他提出不少严正的质问，这是因为苏联人民希望美国改变它对苏联不友好的政策。
    但是，尼克松却故意歪曲苏联政府和人民的好意，借此诽谤苏联的政策，看来挨惯了番茄、土豆的这位副总统是不识抬举的。
