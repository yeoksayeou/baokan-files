    Semimonthly International Review
    (July 16 to July 31)
    After the Geneva Conference Resumed
    The Geneva Eastern and Western Foreign Ministers Conference resumed on July 13 after a recess of more than twenty days. However, in the past two weeks, the conference has not made any progress.
    As everyone knows, on the day before the adjournment on June 20, the Soviet Union proposed that both sides conclude a temporary agreement on the West Berlin issue. The content of the agreement was: the occupation forces of the Western countries in West Berlin should be reduced to a symbolic number; subversive and destructive activities against the German Democratic Republic and the socialist camp from West Berlin should be stopped; and atomic rocket weapons should not be deployed in West Berlin. The agreement would be valid for one and a half years. At the same time, representatives of East and West Germany would establish an all-German committee on an equal basis to study and discuss issues related to a peace treaty with Germany and German reunification.
    After the resumption of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union requested the conference to use this proposal as the basis for discussion. The Soviet Union's attitude is entirely based on reality. The Geneva Conference should have contributed to the settlement of the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. However, since the Western countries indicated in the first stage of the conference that they had no intention of promoting the solution of these two fundamental issues, at least a temporary agreement should be sought on the West Berlin issue after the resumption, and some favorable conditions should be created for future settlement of the German peace treaty issue and promotion of German reunification. The Soviet proposal provides a reasonable basis for such a temporary agreement. If the Western countries do not want the entire Geneva Conference to be fruitless, and do not want to disappoint the expectations of the people of the world for the conference, they have no reason to reject the Soviet proposal.
    However, the situation after the resumption showed that the Western countries, led by the United States, still insisted on their stubborn position before the adjournment, and even got worse. They continued to unreasonably demand the permanentization of the West Berlin occupation system, opposed the reduction of the occupying forces, and clamored that the Soviet Union's deadline could not be accepted, although the Soviet representative had repeatedly stated that even after the deadline, negotiations could continue. The Western foreign ministers could not come up with any reasons to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for an all-German committee, so they used the so-called four-power committee proposal to counter it. The fundamental purpose of this proposal is to have the four major powers take over the German peace treaty and German reunification issue, and prevent the rapprochement and cooperation between the two Germanys. This is essentially an act of overstepping one's authority and interfering in internal affairs. It should be pointed out that the Western countries themselves had proposed the all-German committee in the past "package plan," but now they have become firm opponents of this proposal. It is no wonder that even the British "Manchester Guardian" cannot help but point out that the West's "arguments lack coherence," saying that the West's attitude is "obviously inconsistent and puzzling."
    In view of this attitude of the Western countries, the Soviet representative once again stated at the meeting that it is absolutely impossible for the West to use the conference to guarantee the permanentization of the West Berlin occupation system. However, the possibility of seeking an agreement on the West Berlin issue still exists. The question is whether the Western countries will change their stubborn position and adopt a realistic attitude. In the so-called new proposal put forward by the Western countries on July 28, they still insisted on unreasonable demands. Some responsible persons of the Western delegations tried their best to release pessimistic air, and US Secretary of State Herter even threatened the Soviet Union with a deadline to end the meeting. Many reports from Western news agencies now believe that the Geneva Conference has entered the final decisive stage. The outcome of the conference depends entirely on the Western countries. Even Reuters believes that "if the West insists on interrupting the meeting, it will be difficult not to be accused of sabotaging the negotiations."
    A New Climax in Cuba's Anti-American Struggle
    The Cuban people's struggle against American interference has made significant progress in the past half month. On July 17, Urrutia announced his resignation from the presidency after his conspiracy to betray the country was exposed. This was a major blow to the US imperialists' plan to create political chaos in Cuba from within.
    Urrutia, who was hailed by the United Press International as "very anti-communist and pro-American," used his power to obstruct the implementation of revolutionary laws, undermine the implementation of cabinet decisions, and exonerate the crimes of the traitorous former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz. He cooperated with the US imperialists in interfering in Cuba's internal affairs under the guise of "opposing the communist threat," wantonly attacked the Cuban People's Socialist Party, and attempted to split the unity of the Cuban revolutionary ranks. He even began to formulate a detailed plan against the government, forcing Prime Minister Castro to resign because it was impossible to perform his duties. However, the conspirators lifted a rock only to drop it on their own feet; when the Cuban people learned of Urrutia's crimes "on the verge of treason" from Castro's resignation statement, they were outraged and unanimously demanded that Castro stay in office and opposed the conspirators occupying the position of president. Urrutia was forced to step down, which was a major victory for the Cuban national democratic revolution. It consolidated the achievements of the Cuban revolution and created favorable conditions for the further development of the Cuban revolution. This event also eloquently shows that the Cuban people are fully capable of identifying and defeating the despicable conspiracies of internal and external counter-revolutionary forces.
    The Urrutia incident greatly stimulated the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution and oppose American interference. The million-strong mass demonstration in Havana on July 26 marked a new climax in the Cuban people's anti-American struggle. The conference warmly hailed the decision of Castro to remain as Prime Minister, thus showing that the Cuban people fully supported the provisional government after the purge of the traitorous elements of Urrutia and fully supported Castro's policy of defending the revolution and opposing American interference. The participation of delegations and prominent figures from many Latin American countries in the Havana conference vividly demonstrated the solidarity of the people of Latin American countries and expressed their willingness to share weal and woe with the Cuban people, because, as Prime Minister Castro pointed out at the conference, defending the Cuban revolution is defending the freedom of the people of Latin American countries.
    The United States is now actively preparing to accuse Cuba of "creating tension in the Caribbean region" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Twenty-One American Countries in mid-August, as a basis for armed intervention. However, Cuba has not been intimidated by this conspiracy of the United States. The Cuban Foreign Minister has announced that Cuba will propose to discuss basic issues such as the underdevelopment and political instability of Latin American countries at the meeting. If these basic issues are not discussed, Cuba will not participate in the meeting. It can be seen that the United States' plan to use the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Twenty-One American Countries to suppress Cuba cannot be realized; on the contrary, the various conspiracies of the United States to interfere in Cuba will only further stimulate the anti-American struggle of the people of Latin American countries, making the United States' position in Latin America even more isolated.
    The Economic Confrontation in Western Europe
    Recently, a confrontation between the two economic groups within the capitalist countries of Western Europe has officially begun. On July 21, the ministerial meeting of the seven Western European countries, which closed in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, issued a communiqué, deciding to recommend that their governments "establish a European Free Trade Association among the seven countries." This is the so-called "small free trade zone" of the Western European "outer seven countries." The participating countries include Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Norway, and Portugal.
    According to the provisions of the "small free trade zone" plan announced by the conference, from July 1960, tariffs will be reduced by 20% within the seven countries, and tariffs between the seven countries will be gradually eliminated completely within ten years until 1970. The seven countries will maintain their own different tariff rates for goods from countries outside this group. This plan only applies to industrial products, and a special agreement will be reached separately on the issue of agricultural products.
    The "small free trade zone" is an exclusive economic group established under the advocacy and planning of Britain. Its purpose is to confront and compete with the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries established on January 1 this year. The establishment of the "Common Market," led by West Germany and France, has formed a great threat to Britain's trade in Western Europe and its attempt to seize hegemony in Western Europe. In order to resist the establishment of the "Common Market," Britain had long ago proposed the establishment of a "free trade zone" of seventeen Western European countries. This proposal was aborted because it was firmly opposed by West Germany and France. However, Britain was not reconciled to this failure. For more than half a year, it has been carrying out activities to prepare for the establishment of the "small free trade zone." This activity finally produced results recently.
    Judging from the strength of the "small free trade zone," it is far inferior to the six-nation "Common Market" (the number of member states of the "Common Market" has now increased to seven due to Greece's recent participation). The "Common Market" has a population of more than 160 million, its industrial production accounts for 21.6% of the total industrial output of the capitalist world, and its exports account for 24.1%. The "small free trade zone" has a population of only more than 88 million, its industrial output accounts for only 11.3%, and its exports account for only 16.8%. That is to say, the strength of the latter accounts for only about half of the former. However, if we look at the mutual trade situation between the two economic groups, we can know that the establishment of the "small free trade zone" is a considerable threat to some countries in the "Common Market," especially West Germany. West Germany's exports to the "Common Market" countries account for 29% of its total exports, while its exports to the "outer seven countries" also account for 27%. After the establishment of the "small free trade zone," West Germany's trade with these countries will be greatly reduced due to encountering tariff barriers. In the Scandinavian countries, where West Germany has always exported a lot, West Germany's position will also be replaced by Britain. This situation is certainly unfavorable to West Germany. Britain also attempts to use this to exert pressure on West Germany and strive to reopen the negotiations on the establishment of the seventeen-nation "free trade zone" that have been shelved.
    The establishment of the "small free trade zone" shows that the trade war of the capitalist countries in Western Europe has entered a new stage. The open confrontation between the two economic groups will inevitably lead to further development and intensification of their economic and political contradictions.

    半月国际述评
    （七月十六日至三十一日）
    日内瓦会议复会以后
    日内瓦东西方外长会议休会二十多天以后，在7月13日复会了。但两个多星期来，会议没有取得什么进展。
    大家知道，在6月20日休会的前一天，苏联曾经建议双方就西柏林问题缔结一项临时协定。协定的内容是：西方国家在西柏林的占领军裁减到象征性的数量；停止从西柏林对德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营进行颠覆破坏活动；不在西柏林设置原子火箭武器。协定的有效期限为一年半。在这同时，由东西德代表在对等的基础上建立全德委员会，来研究和讨论有关对德和约和德国统一的问题。
    日内瓦会议复会以后，苏联就要求会议以这个建议作为讨论的基础。苏联的这种态度完全是从现实出发的。日内瓦会议本来应该在解决对德和约和西柏林问题上作出贡献。但既然西方国家在会议的第一阶段表明它们完全无意于促进这两个根本问题的解决，那么复会以后至少也应该在西柏林问题上求得临时协议，并为今后解决对德和约问题和促进德国统一创造一些有利的条件。苏联的建议正是为这种临时协议提供了一个合理的基础。如果不愿使整个日内瓦会议一事无成，不愿辜负世界各国人民对会议的殷望，西方国家就没有任何理由拒绝苏联建议。
    但是复会以后的情况表明，以美国为首的西方国家仍然坚持着它们在休会以前的顽固立场，甚至变得更坏了。它们继续无理要求西柏林占领制度的永久化，反对裁减占领军队，叫嚷不能接受苏联的限期，虽然苏联代表已多次声明，即使到了限期也仍然可以继续商量。西方外长们讲不出什么道理来反对苏联关于全德委员会的主张，就用所谓四国委员会的主张来对抗。而这个主张的根本目的，是要由四大国来包办对德和约和德国统一问题，阻挠两个德国的接近和合作。这实质上是一种越俎代庖和干涉内政的行为。应该指出的是：西方国家自己就曾在过去的“一揽子计划”中提出过全德委员会的主张，现在它们却成为这个主张的坚决反对者。这就难怪连英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”也不能不指出西方的“论据缺乏连贯性”，说西方的态度“显然前后不一致和令人费解”。
    鉴于西方国家的这种态度，苏联代表在会上再一次声明，西方要想由会议来保证西柏林占领制度永久化是绝对办不到的。但是在西柏林问题上谋求协议的可能性仍然是存在的。问题在于西方国家是否改变它们的顽固立场，而采取现实的态度。西方国家在7月28日提出的所谓新建议中仍然坚持无理要求。西方代表团的一些负责人士则竭力放出悲观空气，美国国务卿赫脱甚至以限期结束会议来对苏联进行要挟。现在西方通讯社的许多报道都认为日内瓦会议已经进入最后的决定性阶段。究竟会议的结果如何，完全要看西方国家了。连路透社也认为，“如果西方坚持要中断会议，就很难不受到破坏谈判的指责”。
    古巴反美斗争的新高潮
    古巴人民反对美国干涉的斗争，在过去半月中又有重大发展。7月17日，乌鲁蒂亚在其叛变阴谋被揭露后宣布辞去总统职务，这是对美帝国主义从内部来制造古巴政局混乱的计划的一次巨大打击。
    被合众国际社誉为“非常反共和亲美的”乌鲁蒂亚，利用职权阻挠革命法律的实施，破坏内阁决定的执行，为叛国分子前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯的罪行开脱。他配合美帝国主义的在“反对共产主义威胁”的幌子下干涉古巴内政的活动，放肆攻击古巴人民社会党，企图分裂古巴革命队伍的团结。他甚至开始制订了一项反对政府的周密计划，迫使卡斯特罗总理由于不可能行使职责而辞职。然而，阴谋者搬起石头却打了自己的脚；当古巴人民从卡斯特罗的辞职声明中获悉乌鲁蒂亚的“在卖国边缘上”的罪行时，群情激愤，一致要求卡斯特罗留任，反对由阴谋者占据总统的职位。乌鲁蒂亚被迫下台，这是古巴民族民主革命事业的重大胜利，它巩固了古巴革命的成果，为古巴革命的进一步发展创造了有利的条件。这一事件也雄辩地说明了古巴人民完全有能力识别并击败内外反革命势力的卑鄙阴谋。
    乌鲁蒂亚事件，大大刺激了古巴人民保卫革命、反对美国干涉的斗争。7月26日哈瓦那的百万群众示威大会，标志着古巴人民反美斗争的新高潮。大会热烈欢呼卡斯特罗留任总理的决定，以此来表明古巴人民全力支持清洗了乌鲁蒂亚之流卖国分子后的临时政府，全力支持卡斯特罗保卫革命和反对美国干涉的政策。许多拉丁美洲国家的代表团和知名人士的参加哈瓦那大会，生动地表现了拉丁美洲各国人民的团结，表达了他们和古巴人民同患难共呼吸的愿望，因为，正如卡斯特罗总理在大会上所指出的，保卫古巴革命就是保卫了拉丁美洲各国人民的自由。
    美国现在正积极准备在8月中旬召开的美洲二十一国外长会议上，把“制造加勒比海地区紧张局势”的罪名加在古巴头上，作为进行武装干涉的根据。但是，古巴并没有为美国这一阴谋所吓倒。古巴外交部长已经宣布，古巴将要在会议上提出讨论像拉丁美洲各国不发达和政治不稳定这样一些基本问题。而如果不讨论这些基本问题，古巴将不参加会议。人们可以看到，美国指望利用二十一国外长会议来压制古巴的计划，是不能实现的；恰恰相反，美国干涉古巴的种种阴谋，只会更加激发拉丁美洲各国人民的反美斗争，使美国在拉丁美洲的地位更加孤立。
    西欧的经济对垒战
    最近西欧资本主义国家内部两个经济集团之间的一场对垒战算正式开始了。7月21日，在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩闭幕的西欧七国部长级会议发表公报，决定建议他们的政府“在七国之间成立一个欧洲自由贸易联盟”，这就是所谓西欧“外部七国”的“小自由贸易区”。参加的国家包括英国、瑞典、瑞士、丹麦、奥地利、挪威和葡萄牙。
    根据会议所公布的“小自由贸易区”计划的规定，从1960年7月起，在七国内部降低关税20％，并将在到1970年为止的十年内逐步做到完全取消七国之间的关税。而对来自这个集团以外的国家的商品，七国仍将保持各自不同的关税率。这个计划只适用于工业品，关于农产品的问题将另外达成一项特别的协议。
      “小自由贸易区”是在英国的鼓吹和策划之下建立起来的一个排他性的经济集团。它的目的是跟今年1月1日成立的西欧六国“共同市场”进行对抗和竞争。以西德和法国为主的“共同市场”的建立，对英国在西欧的贸易和争夺西欧霸权的企图，形成了很大的威胁。为了抵制“共同市场”的建立，英国很早以前就曾提出了建立西欧十七国“自由贸易区”的主张。这个主张因为遭到西德与法国的坚决反对而流产了。但是英国并不甘心于这个失败。半年多来，它一直在进行着筹建“小自由贸易区”的活动。这个活动终于在最近产生了结果。
    从“小自由贸易区”的实力来看，它是远远不及六国“共同市场”的（由于最近希腊的参加，“共同市场”的成员国现在已增加到七国）。“共同市场”的人口共有一亿六千多万，它的工业生产量占资本主义世界工业总产量的21.6％，出口占24.1％。而“小自由贸易区”的人口只有八千八百多万，工业产量只占11.3％，出口只占16.8％。也就是说，后者的实力只占前者的一半左右。但是，如果从两个经济集团之间的相互贸易情况来看，就可以知道，“小自由贸易区”的建立，对于“共同市场”的一些国家，特别对于西德，是一个不小的威胁。西德对“共同市场”各国的出口占其出口总额的29％，而对“外部七国”的出口也占到27％。“小自由贸易区”建立以后，西德对这些国家的贸易将会因为碰到关税壁垒而大大削减。在西德出口一向很多的斯堪的纳维亚国家中，西德的地位也将被英国所取代。这种情形当然是对西德不利的。英国还企图利用这一点来向西德施加压力，争取重开已被搁置的建立十七国“自由贸易区”的谈判。
    “小自由贸易区”的建立，说明西欧资本主义国家的贸易战已进入了一个新的阶段。两个经济集团的公开对垒，必将引起它们之间经济和政治矛盾的进一步发展和激化。
