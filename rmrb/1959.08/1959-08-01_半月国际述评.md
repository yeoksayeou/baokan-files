    Semimonthly International Review
    (July 16 to July 31)
    After the Geneva Conference Resumed
    The Geneva Eastern and Western Foreign Ministers Conference resumed on July 13 after a recess of more than twenty days. However, in the past two weeks, the conference has not made any progress.
    As everyone knows, on the day before the adjournment on June 20, the Soviet Union proposed that both sides conclude a temporary agreement on the West Berlin issue. The content of the agreement was: the occupation forces of the Western countries in West Berlin should be reduced to a symbolic number; subversive and destructive activities against the German Democratic Republic and the socialist camp from West Berlin should be stopped; and atomic rocket weapons should not be deployed in West Berlin. The agreement would be valid for one and a half years. At the same time, representatives of East and West Germany would establish an all-German committee on an equal basis to study and discuss issues related to a peace treaty with Germany and German reunification.
    After the resumption of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union requested the conference to use this proposal as the basis for discussion. The Soviet Union's attitude is entirely based on reality. The Geneva Conference should have contributed to the settlement of the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. However, since the Western countries indicated in the first stage of the conference that they had no intention of promoting the solution of these two fundamental issues, at least a temporary agreement should be sought on the West Berlin issue after the resumption, and some favorable conditions should be created for future settlement of the German peace treaty issue and promotion of German reunification. The Soviet proposal provides a reasonable basis for such a temporary agreement. If the Western countries do not want the entire Geneva Conference to be fruitless, and do not want to disappoint the expectations of the people of the world for the conference, they have no reason to reject the Soviet proposal.
    However, the situation after the resumption showed that the Western countries, led by the United States, still insisted on their stubborn position before the adjournment, and even got worse. They continued to unreasonably demand the permanentization of the West Berlin occupation system, opposed the reduction of the occupying forces, and clamored that the Soviet Union's deadline could not be accepted, although the Soviet representative had repeatedly stated that even after the deadline, negotiations could continue. The Western foreign ministers could not come up with any reasons to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for an all-German committee, so they used the so-called four-power committee proposal to counter it. The fundamental purpose of this proposal is to have the four major powers take over the German peace treaty and German reunification issue, and prevent the rapprochement and cooperation between the two Germanys. This is essentially an act of overstepping one's authority and interfering in internal affairs. It should be pointed out that the Western countries themselves had proposed the all-German committee in the past "package plan," but now they have become firm opponents of this proposal. It is no wonder that even the British "Manchester Guardian" cannot help but point out that the West's "arguments lack coherence," saying that the West's attitude is "obviously inconsistent and puzzling."
    In view of this attitude of the Western countries, the Soviet representative once again stated at the meeting that it is absolutely impossible for the West to use the conference to guarantee the permanentization of the West Berlin occupation system. However, the possibility of seeking an agreement on the West Berlin issue still exists. The question is whether the Western countries will change their stubborn position and adopt a realistic attitude. In the so-called new proposal put forward by the Western countries on July 28, they still insisted on unreasonable demands. Some responsible persons of the Western delegations tried their best to release pessimistic air, and US Secretary of State Herter even threatened the Soviet Union with a deadline to end the meeting. Many reports from Western news agencies now believe that the Geneva Conference has entered the final decisive stage. The outcome of the conference depends entirely on the Western countries. Even Reuters believes that "if the West insists on interrupting the meeting, it will be difficult not to be accused of sabotaging the negotiations."
    A New Climax in Cuba's Anti-American Struggle
    The Cuban people's struggle against American interference has made significant progress in the past half month. On July 17, Urrutia announced his resignation from the presidency after his conspiracy to betray the country was exposed. This was a major blow to the US imperialists' plan to create political chaos in Cuba from within.
    Urrutia, who was hailed by the United Press International as "very anti-communist and pro-American," used his power to obstruct the implementation of revolutionary laws, undermine the implementation of cabinet decisions, and exonerate the crimes of the traitorous former Air Force Commander Diaz Lanz. He cooperated with the US imperialists in interfering in Cuba's internal affairs under the guise of "opposing the communist threat," wantonly attacked the Cuban People's Socialist Party, and attempted to split the unity of the Cuban revolutionary ranks. He even began to formulate a detailed plan against the government, forcing Prime Minister Castro to resign because it was impossible to perform his duties. However, the conspirators lifted a rock only to drop it on their own feet; when the Cuban people learned of Urrutia's crimes "on the verge of treason" from Castro's resignation statement, they were outraged and unanimously demanded that Castro stay in office and opposed the conspirators occupying the position of president. Urrutia was forced to step down, which was a major victory for the Cuban national democratic revolution. It consolidated the achievements of the Cuban revolution and created favorable conditions for the further development of the Cuban revolution. This event also eloquently shows that the Cuban people are fully capable of identifying and defeating the despicable conspiracies of internal and external counter-revolutionary forces.
    The Urrutia incident greatly stimulated the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution and oppose American interference. The million-strong mass demonstration in Havana on July 26 marked a new climax in the Cuban people's anti-American struggle. The conference warmly hailed the decision of Castro to remain as Prime Minister, thus showing that the Cuban people fully supported the provisional government after the purge of the traitorous elements of Urrutia and fully supported Castro's policy of defending the revolution and opposing American interference. The participation of delegations and prominent figures from many Latin American countries in the Havana conference vividly demonstrated the solidarity of the people of Latin American countries and expressed their willingness to share weal and woe with the Cuban people, because, as Prime Minister Castro pointed out at the conference, defending the Cuban revolution is defending the freedom of the people of Latin American countries.
    The United States is now actively preparing to accuse Cuba of "creating tension in the Caribbean region" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Twenty-One American Countries in mid-August, as a basis for armed intervention. However, Cuba has not been intimidated by this conspiracy of the United States. The Cuban Foreign Minister has announced that Cuba will propose to discuss basic issues such as the underdevelopment and political instability of Latin American countries at the meeting. If these basic issues are not discussed, Cuba will not participate in the meeting. It can be seen that the United States' plan to use the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Twenty-One American Countries to suppress Cuba cannot be realized; on the contrary, the various conspiracies of the United States to interfere in Cuba will only further stimulate the anti-American struggle of the people of Latin American countries, making the United States' position in Latin America even more isolated.
    The Economic Confrontation in Western Europe
    Recently, a confrontation between the two economic groups within the capitalist countries of Western Europe has officially begun. On July 21, the ministerial meeting of the seven Western European countries, which closed in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, issued a communiqu√©, deciding to recommend that their governments "establish a European Free Trade Association among the seven countries." This is the so-called "small free trade zone" of the Western European "outer seven countries." The participating countries include Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Norway, and Portugal.
    According to the provisions of the "small free trade zone" plan announced by the conference, from July 1960, tariffs will be reduced by 20% within the seven countries, and tariffs between the seven countries will be gradually eliminated completely within ten years until 1970. The seven countries will maintain their own different tariff rates for goods from countries outside this group. This plan only applies to industrial products, and a special agreement will be reached separately on the issue of agricultural products.
    The "small free trade zone" is an exclusive economic group established under the advocacy and planning of Britain. Its purpose is to confront and compete with the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries established on January 1 this year. The establishment of the "Common Market," led by West Germany and France, has formed a great threat to Britain's trade in Western Europe and its attempt to seize hegemony in Western Europe. In order to resist the establishment of the "Common Market," Britain had long ago proposed the establishment of a "free trade zone" of seventeen Western European countries. This proposal was aborted because it was firmly opposed by West Germany and France. However, Britain was not reconciled to this failure. For more than half a year, it has been carrying out activities to prepare for the establishment of the "small free trade zone." This activity finally produced results recently.
    Judging from the strength of the "small free trade zone," it is far inferior to the six-nation "Common Market" (the number of member states of the "Common Market" has now increased to seven due to Greece's recent participation). The "Common Market" has a population of more than 160 million, its industrial production accounts for 21.6% of the total industrial output of the capitalist world, and its exports account for 24.1%. The "small free trade zone" has a population of only more than 88 million, its industrial output accounts for only 11.3%, and its exports account for only 16.8%. That is to say, the strength of the latter accounts for only about half of the former. However, if we look at the mutual trade situation between the two economic groups, we can know that the establishment of the "small free trade zone" is a considerable threat to some countries in the "Common Market," especially West Germany. West Germany's exports to the "Common Market" countries account for 29% of its total exports, while its exports to the "outer seven countries" also account for 27%. After the establishment of the "small free trade zone," West Germany's trade with these countries will be greatly reduced due to encountering tariff barriers. In the Scandinavian countries, where West Germany has always exported a lot, West Germany's position will also be replaced by Britain. This situation is certainly unfavorable to West Germany. Britain also attempts to use this to exert pressure on West Germany and strive to reopen the negotiations on the establishment of the seventeen-nation "free trade zone" that have been shelved.
    The establishment of the "small free trade zone" shows that the trade war of the capitalist countries in Western Europe has entered a new stage. The open confrontation between the two economic groups will inevitably lead to further development and intensification of their economic and political contradictions.
