　　Push All Work Forward
　　Wu Lü

　　We often see the following situation: when processing the same parts, some workers are unhurried and calmly complete the production tasks excellently; some workers are flustered and sweaty, yet still fail to meet the production quota. What is the reason for this? A relatively common reason is the significant difference in technical level. Those with high technical skills tend to be fast and good, while those with low technical skills tend to be slow and poor. But in addition to this, there is also the following situation: some people are good at arranging work, clarifying tasks, familiarizing themselves with drawings, adjusting machine tools, and preparing tools in advance, so all work is pushed forward. Therefore, when they work, they are calm, unhurried, and very proactive. Others sharpen their spears only before the battle. They don't clarify the task beforehand, don't familiarize themselves with the drawings, the machine tools are not adjusted, and the tools are not prepared. Much of the work falls behind, so they are flustered and extremely passive.

　　The work of an individual is like this, and the work of an entire enterprise is even more so. An enterprise's production involves many threads, and the upper and lower processes, and the left and right departments, all affect each other. If all work is done as a "last-minute cramming," it will fall into a passive state. Conversely, if all work is pushed forward, planning ahead and taking preemptive action, one can be assured of victory. The news about the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine published in today's newspaper is an example. Tangjiazhuang Mine is an old mine that has been mined for many years, and the production conditions are not good. However, they "push all work forward," plan production early, start production preparations early, and also grasp ideological work early. As a result, the entire mine is full of vitality, the work is organized, and the national plan is overfulfilled every month. It can be seen that as long as you have foresight and push forward, everything is not difficult to do well.

　　However, some people also say: "One step behind, every step behind. Our work has already fallen behind, how easy is it to push forward?" Is "one step behind, every step behind" correct? It seems to be both correct and incorrect.

　　If we understand this sentence from the relationship between the local and the whole, then this sentence is correct. "A single bad move loses the whole game." One step behind, and every step after that is affected. Therefore, we must grasp every step tightly and strive to move forward in every step. If we understand this sentence from a metaphysical point of view, and it seems that once we are one step behind, we believe that we can never catch up, then this sentence is incorrect. Front and back can also be transformed. In the past, the work of Tangjiazhuang Mine was not always pushed forward, and it was not always so organized. The situation of looseness, tightness, passivity and busyness was also very serious. Now aren't they pushing forward and being very proactive?

　　"Push forward, not backward," "Early, not late." If you have fallen behind, you must catch up to the front; if you are grasping late, you want to grasp earlier. It seems that the key issue is still the word "drive." The so-called "push all work forward" is not just a leadership method issue, but more importantly, it is an issue of revolutionary drive. With the revolutionary drive of "pushing all work forward," vowing to strive for the upper reaches and not willing to fall behind, can we truly make all work pushed forward.

### 一切工作往前赶

　　一切工作往前赶
　　吴滤
    常常可以看见这样的情形：加工同一种零件，有些工人不慌不忙，从从容容，出色地完成了生产任务；有些工人手忙脚乱，满头大汗，仍然达不到生产定额。这是什么原因呢？一个比较通常的原因是技术水平高低悬殊，技术高的往往快而好，技术低的往往慢而差。但除此以外，也还有这样的情形：一种人由于善于安排工作，事先明确任务、熟悉图纸、调整机床、准备工具，一切工作都赶在前面，因此工作起来，从容不迫，主动得很；另一种人临阵磨枪，事先不去把任务搞明确，不去熟悉图纸，机床也没有调整好，工具也没有准备好，许多工作都落在后面，因此手忙脚乱，被动之至。
    个人的工作是如此，整个企业的工作更是如此。企业的生产头绪多端，上下工序之间、左右部门之间，无不彼此影响。如果各项工作都“临时抱佛脚，就陷于被动。反之，如果一切工作都往前赶，未雨绸缪，先发制人，就可以稳操胜券。今天本报发表的开滦唐家庄煤矿的新闻就是一个例子。唐家庄矿是一个开采多年的老矿，生产条件并不好，但是他们“一切工作往前赶”，生产计划安排得早，生产准备动手得早，思想工作也抓得早，结果全矿生气勃勃，工作有条有理，月月全面超额完成国家计划。可见，凡事只要有预见，往前赶，都是不难做好的。
    然而，也有人说：“一步迟，步步迟。我们的工作已经掉在后面了，往前赶谈何容易？”“一步迟，步步迟”，这话对不对呢？看来，又对又不对。
    如果从局部和整体的关系来理解这句话，应该说这句话是对的。“棋差一着满盘输”，一步迟了，以后步步也受到影响，因而我们要步步抓紧，步步赶前。如果用形而上学的观点来理解这句话，似乎一步迟了，就认定以后再也不能赶上前来，那么这句话就是不对的了。前和后也是可以转化的。唐家庄矿以前的工作也不是都赶在前面，都那么有条有理的，松松紧紧，被动忙乱的情形也是很严重的，现在他们不是赶在前面，很主动了吗？
    “赶前不赶后”，“赶早不赶晚”。已经掉在后面要赶到前面去，抓晚了要想抓早些，看来，关键问题还是干劲二字。所谓“一切工作往前赶”，并不只是一个领导方法问题，更重要的还是一个革命干劲问题。有了“一切工作往前赶”的革命干劲，誓争上游，不甘落后，才能真正使一切工作都赶在前面。
