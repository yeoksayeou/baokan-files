Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League issued a notice on the 9th to the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal committees of the Communist Youth League, requiring them to mobilize the nation's youth to take swift action, working diligently, cleverly, and practically, to wage a major battle in August and September, to display their talents in the new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, to play a greater shock role, to complete and over fulfill the increased production tasks on all fronts, and to greet the tenth anniversary of the great motherland.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League first requires all levels of the Youth League committees to immediately and vigorously organize all cadres from the Youth League committees at all levels down to the grassroots Youth League organizations to conscientiously study and discuss the People's Daily editorial of August 6th, "Overcome Right-leaning Emotions, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," to raise awareness, recognize the situation, and overcome the Right-leaning emotions existing among some cadres.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that the Youth League committees in various regions, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, will immediately publicize the current excellent situation to the broad masses of young people in light of local conditions, do a good job in ideological mobilization to actively participate in the new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, and quickly organize young people to participate in the new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy.

In the industrial sector, the Central Committee of the Youth League requires all regions to do three things: (1) Launch a large-scale campaign among young workers to strive for high-yield and high-quality products. In particular, it is necessary to educate young people on ensuring product quality, disseminate advanced experiences, and carry out competition activities such as "high-quality skilled workers." (2) Carry out activities to establish model workers, catch up with advanced workers, and help those who are lagging behind. Call on every young socialist construction activist to enthusiastically help others and help those who are lagging behind, and when necessary, go to backward units to work and help them catch up with the advanced. (3) Continue to do a good job in cultivating and educating new workers, and improve their political awareness and technical level. This is a very important aspect of leading young workers to achieve continued leap forward.

In agriculture, the Youth League organizations in various regions must regard doing everything possible to strive for a bumper autumn harvest as the most central task, and currently mobilize young people to focus on three things: (1) Vigorously mobilize young people to participate in the struggle against disasters, educate young people to overcome disasters in every possible way, and fight for grain with nature. (2) Vigorously carry out a concentrated activity of accumulating fertilizer, especially pressing green manure, and carry out comparisons and competitions for accumulating fertilizer. (3) Vigorously seize the activity of silage feed.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League pointed out that in carrying out these activities, the leading organs of the League should pay attention to both discovering and establishing advanced models in a timely manner, and having a vigorous mass movement; both going deep into the base points to strengthen the grassroots, and carrying out some larger-scale regional or provincial youth activities in a timely manner as needed. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Youth League also requires all regions to immediately take concrete measures in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Youth League, strengthen grassroots work, and close the ties between higher and lower levels.

　　共青团中央号召全国青年在生产新高潮中大显身手
    新华社10日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央9日通知共青团各省、自治区、市委员会，要求他们动员全国青年迅速行动起来，苦干、巧干、实干，大战8、9两月，在增产节约新高潮中大显身手，发挥更大的突击作用，完成和超额完成各个战线上的增产任务，迎接伟大祖国的国庆十周年。
    共青团中央首先要求各级团委立即大力组织从各级团委直到基层团组织的全体干部，认真学习和讨论人民日报8月6日“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，以提高觉悟、认清形势，克服一部分干部中存在的右倾情绪。
    共青团中央希望各地团委，在党委的统一领导下，结合当地情况，立即向广大青年宣传当前的大好形势，做好积极投入新的增产节约高潮的思想动员，并且迅速组织青年投入新的增产节约高潮。
    在工业方面，团中央要求各地做好三件事情：（一）在青年工人中开展一个声势浩大的争取高产优质的活动。特别要对青年进行保证产品质量的教育，传播先进经验，开展“优质能手”等竞赛活动。（二）开展树标兵、赶先进、帮助落后的活动。号召每个青年社会主义建设积极分子都要热心帮助别人，帮助落后，必要时要到落后单位去工作，帮助它们赶上先进。（三）继续做好培养、教育新工人的工作，提高他们的政治觉悟和技术水平。这是带领青年工人实现继续跃进的一个很重要的方面。
    在农业方面，各地团组织都要把千方百计为争取秋季丰收当做最中心的任务，当前要发动青年狠抓三件事：（一）大力发动青年投入抗灾斗争，教育青年千方百计地战胜灾害，与天争粮。（二）大搞积肥特别是压绿肥的突击活动，开展积肥的评比竞赛。（三）大抓青贮饲料的活动。
    共青团中央指出，在开展这些活动的时候，团的领导机关应当注意既要及时地发现和树立先进典型，又要有轰轰烈烈的群众运动；既要深入基点，加强基层，又要根据需要不失时机地开展一些声势较大的地区的或全省性的青年活动。同时，团中央还要求各地根据团的三届五中全会决议的精神，立即采取具体措施，加强基层工作，密切上下联系。
