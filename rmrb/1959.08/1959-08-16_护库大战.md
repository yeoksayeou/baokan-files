    Warehouse Protection Battle
    By Our Correspondent Ning Huanming
    From 2 PM on August 6th, the rain fell incessantly. Dozens of units from the Beijing First Commercial Bureau system were holding an on-site meeting at the Malian Road Warehouse to summarize their previous experiences fighting against the torrential rain. Suddenly, they received a notice from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, stating that there would be even heavier rainfall that night, requiring everyone to make preparations for flood prevention. At 6 PM, as expected, floodwaters from the upper reaches of the Lianhua River overflowed, and in an instant, a torrent of water rushed from the west and north, filling the area outside the warehouse walls with a foot of water. The water level continued to rise, and the situation became extremely critical. A serious test had arrived. Under the leadership of the flood prevention headquarters, with the Party General Branch Committee at its core, an emergency meeting was immediately convened. The meeting analyzed the current situation and determined that the immediate main tasks were to defend the warehouse walls and gates, blocking the floodwaters; at the same time, strengthen the inspection of the warehouses and the reconnaissance of the water situation. After the meeting, the instructions were immediately disseminated. An even greater warehouse protection battle began.
    The Party Secretary, serving as the Commander-in-Chief, maintained a unified understanding of the situation in the headquarters and was responsible for overall command. The Warehouse Director and Deputy Secretary of the General Branch, serving as Deputy Commanders-in-Chief, commanded the operations in the temporary branch headquarters set up in the east and west warehouses, respectively. At this time, all five hundred employees of the warehouse braved the rain and waded into the battle positions, plugging holes in the warehouses inside and out, blocking the warehouse doors, draining accumulated water, and dredging the river ditches; at the same time, reconnaissance personnel were dispatched to Liuliqiao and Fengtai to the west, and Wanzhiqiao to the north, to investigate the water situation. Handcarts loaded with sandbags were all parked beside the warehouse walls, ready to be used to block any wall collapses.
    The rain continued to fall incessantly, and the water gradually rose. The water outside the walls had reached two feet deep, and the threat was increasing. At this critical moment, Comrade Zhang Xu, the First Secretary of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and other comrades arrived. After inspecting the flood prevention preparations, they demanded that the floodwaters be resolutely blocked to ensure the safety of the warehouse. In addition to guarding the first line of defense, they specifically instructed that a second line of defense must be established, and a one-meter-high waterproof dam should be built overnight on the northern front. They designated the Party Committee of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Plant, the Guangwai Street Party Committee, and the Grain Warehouse to be ready to send personnel to provide support at any time. Under the leadership of the District Committee, the entire warehouse immediately concentrated its main forces and reinforcements to build the second line of defense together.
    The newly installed searchlights illuminated the entire warehouse, and the drainage pumps rumbled in the middle of the night. Workers waded through knee-deep water, braving the torrential rain, shoveling soil onto the dam. However, due to the heavy rain and rapid water flow, the soil was washed away before it could be placed on the dam. Some comrades became anxious and simply scooped the soil up with their hands. Carts loaded with square bricks were driven through the deep water, and the strong and sturdy Yang Zengmu held the central shaft of the cart and moved forward quickly, sounding like a small steam engine. Communist Party member Kang Quanren carried large square bricks from the city wall, weighing about thirty pounds each, one on his shoulder and one under his arm, carrying them back and forth without stopping. Shao Shuzhen, a female member of the Communist Youth League, was originally in poor health, and the leadership had approved her for half-day work. Now, when state property was seriously threatened, she bravely joined the battle. After carrying the large blue bricks, she set up a rubber-wheeled cart and worked until dawn.
    The battle to build the dam was proceeding intensely, and the workers guarding the warehouse walls were also checking and plugging leaks in the waist-deep water. The East Warehouse discovered that a ditch in the northeast corner was channeling water into the wall. Zong Tingshan, the loading and unloading team leader and a Communist Party member, led fourteen workers to immediately jump into the neck-deep ditch to plug the leaks. As they bent over, their heads were submerged in the water. They raised their heads to catch their breath and finally plugged the holes within an hour. At this time, the West Warehouse discovered a leak in the northeast corner. Zhang Hongqing, the section chief of the Second Cargo Area, and worker Zhao Chengyuan rushed over with grass sacks, filling and plugging them in the water, fighting for two hours.
    The rain continued to fall, and some cargo sheds began to leak. The comrades responsible for inspecting the warehouses immediately organized a rescue effort. More than eighty pieces of celluloid were placed in ordinary civilian houses, with oil felt laid on the ground and no sleepers underneath. Communist Party member Wang Shunqi and three other comrades discovered that water was seeping in and immediately jumped in to scoop it out with their hands and wring it dry with rags, finally draining the water from the house. Han Qiming transferred more than sixty leaking items to a safe area. Communist Party member Zhang Hongmei, after plugging twenty-four doors of six warehouses, went to check other places in the rain. She climbed up high cargo stacks, just like the male workers.
    In this tense battle to rescue state property, many comrades persisted in fighting despite being ill. Warehouse Director Comrade Li Jichuan was gloriously injured while commanding the battle on the front lines, but he continued to direct. Liang Qingsan, the Deputy Secretary of the General Branch, had vomited blood at 2 PM on the 6th, but he did not say a word and worked all night like the other comrades. Wang Dengqin, who had just finished her maternity leave, also competed to join everyone in the battle. The Chairman of the Trade Union repeatedly urged her to go back, but she said that her child was being taken care of by her grandmother and had milk powder to drink when hungry. Although she could not do great things here, she could be responsible for inspecting the goods.
    After a night of hard work, the waterproof dam was finally built by dawn. At this time, more than five hundred reinforcements organized by the Beijing Commercial Bureau arrived, and people began to breathe a sigh of relief.

    护库大战
    本报记者　宁焕明
    8月6日下午二时起，大雨一直不停地下着，北京市第一商业局系统的数十个单位正在马连道仓库召开现场会议总结前次与暴雨搏斗的经验。突然接到中共北京市委的通知，说今晚要有更大的雨水，要求大家作好防洪准备。下午六时，果然莲花河上游洪水外溢，顷刻气势汹涌的洪水，从西、北两面直扑过来，顷刻库墙外西北两面灌满了一尺深的雨水。水情在继续增涨，形势十分危急。一次严重的考验来到了。在党总支委员会为核心组成的防汛总指挥部领导下，立刻召开了紧急会议，会上分析了当前的形势，确定眼前主要任务是守住库墙和大门，挡住大水；同时，加强库房的检查和水情的侦察。会后立刻分头传达。一场更大的护库大战开始了。
    担任总指挥的党委书记在指挥部统一掌握情况，负责全面指挥。担任副总指挥的仓库主任、总支副书记等则分别在东西两仓临时设的分指挥部指挥作战。这时，全库五百余名职工冒雨趟水进入阵地，一面在仓内外塞沟眼，堵库门，排积水，疏导河沟；一面派出侦查人员西去六里桥、丰台，北去湾沚桥侦查水情。装满沙袋的手推车这时也全部停在库墙边，万一库墙倒塌就立即堵上去。
    雨一直下个不停，水逐渐增长，墙外积水已达到二尺深，威胁越来越大。在这紧急关头，中共宣武区委第一书记张旭等同志赶来了。他们检查了防汛准备工作情况后，要求坚决挡住大水，确保仓库安全。除了守护好第一道防线外，特别指示必须设立第二道防线，在靠北正面战场上连夜赶修一座一米高的防水坝。在指定北京第二机床厂党委、广外街道党委和粮食仓库等单位，随时准备派人前来支援。在区委领导下，全库立刻集中主要力量和援军一起，修筑第二道防线。
    新装置的探照灯映得全库通明，排水机在深夜里隆隆作响，工人们在膝盖深的大水中顶着如注的大雨，把一锹锹的泥土堆到坝上。可是，雨大水急，土从地下挖起后没等上坝就被水冲走了。有的同志急了，干脆用手往上捧。架着装满方砖的胶轮大车，在深水中行进，身强力壮的杨增木扶着大车的中辕飞快前进，忽啦忽啦地就像一个小火轮一样。共产党员亢全仁将重约三十斤的城墙大方砖，肩上扛一块，腋下挟一块，来往不停地搬运着。女共青团员邵淑珍本来身体较弱，领导上批准她半天工作，现在在国家财产受到严重威胁的时候，她奋不顾身地参加了战斗。搬完大青砖，又架起胶轮车，一直干到天亮。
    修筑水坝的战斗正在紧张地进行，守护库墙的工人们也在齐腰的深水中检查堵塞漏洞。东库发现东北角的水沟向墙里灌水，装卸队长共产党员宗廷山率领十四个工人立刻跳到脖颈深的水沟中去抢堵，一弯腰头就伸到水里，他们抬起头来喘口气，终于在一小时内把口子堵住了。这时，西库又发现东北角有一个漏洞，第二货区区长张鸿庆和工人赵成源急忙带着草袋子赶了去，在水里边装边堵，一直战斗了两个小时。
    雨不停地下着，有的货棚开始渗水了。担任检查仓库的同志立刻组织抢救。八十多件赛璐璐，放在普通民房里，地上铺着油毡，未垫枕木，共产党员王顺起等四个同志发现渗进水去，立即跳进去用手往外捧，用烂布沾水拧干，终于把房子里的水排净。韩启明把六十多处漏雨的商品转运到安全地带。共产党员张鸿梅参加堵完六幢库房二十四个门以后，又冒雨到别处检查，很高的货垛，她和男职工一样往上爬。
    在这次抢救国家财产的紧张战斗中，不少同志带病坚持战斗。仓库主任李济川同志在临阵指挥中光荣负伤，仍坚持指挥。总支副书记梁庆三6日下午两点刚吐过血，但是他没有吭声和别的同志一样干了一夜。刚满产假的王登勤也争着和大家一起参加战斗。工会主席再三催她回去，她说小孩有姥姥照顾，饿了有奶粉，我在这里虽干不了大事，还可负责商品的检查。
    经过一夜苦战，在天亮的时候，防水坝终于修起来了。这时，北京市商业局组织的五百多名支援大军开到了，人们才开始松了一口气。
