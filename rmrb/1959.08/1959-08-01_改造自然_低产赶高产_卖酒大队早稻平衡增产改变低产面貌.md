Transforming Nature, Low Yields Catching Up with High Yields
Maijiu Brigade's Early Rice Achieves Balanced Production Increase and Changes Low-Yielding Situation

    (Our dispatch) The Maijiu Brigade of the Xiaopingshan Commune in Yulin County, Guangxi, which has increased production every year since cooperativization, has achieved large-scale, high-yield bumper harvests in early rice this year. The brigade has 3,966 mu of early rice. According to statistics from the 2,827 mu that have been harvested, the average yield per mu has increased by 42% compared to last year. The brigade has now transformed from a low-yield, poor area into a high-yield, wealthy area of Yulin County.
    The cultivation area of the Maijiu Brigade was previously a severely drought-prone, infertile, low-yield, and poor area. In the past, three days without rain would result in a small drought, and five days without rain would result in a major drought. 73% of the brigade's paddy fields were often threatened by drought. After cooperativization, under the leadership of the Party, the brigade waged a tenacious struggle against nature, gradually changed the natural environment, and increased production year after year. What is even more exciting this year is that the brigade's early rice achieved a large-scale, balanced production increase, with little difference in yield between production teams. The production teams with poorer conditions have caught up. Zhongliang Village used to be a poor village in the brigade, but now its yield per mu differs from the highest-yielding Qin Village by only twenty or thirty catties.
    Over the past few years, the brigade's Party branch has led the members in a tenacious struggle against nature. They first focused on water conservancy work, building more than 100 reservoirs, dikes, ponds, and canals of various sizes, allowing more than 3,100 mu of drought-prone land to achieve increased production year after year. While gradually overcoming the threat of drought, they also waged a tenacious struggle against shallow and poor soil. In Qin Village, there was a famous Lingxia Gully. The sandy soil washed down from the mountain gorges on both sides of the Lingxia Gully was mixed into the more than 13 mu of land. When dry, this soil was hard clumps of mud, and when soaked with water, it became extremely sticky mud. The members called it "dead mud." In the summer of 1956, they mixed chopped wheat straw, lime, and cow dung into the fields, and the rice seedlings grew relatively well that year. In the spring of 1957, they applied a large amount of green manure, and after the autumn harvest, they applied semi-sandy soil from cassava fields mixed with decomposed turf. As a result, the total yield in 1958 increased by 73% compared to before soil improvement in 1955.
    On the basis of several years of soil improvement work, the brigade paid special attention to scientific fertilization this year. Based on their experience over the years, the members applied sufficient base fertilizer to most of the fields before and after deep plowing, averaging about 184 dan of mud fertilizer per mu. When harrowing the fields and transplanting seedlings, they also applied twenty to thirty dan of manure water per mu. For fields with thin soil and a lack of organic matter, in addition to returning rice straw to the fields, they also applied about 1,000 catties of green manure per mu. In order to ensure a large-scale bumper harvest, the brigade launched a "Four Catching Up" campaign: lean fields catching up with fertile fields, distant fields catching up with fields near the village, mountain slope fields catching up with large open fields, and seedling plots catching up with main fields. When fertilizing, they ensured that good and refined fertilizers were applied more to distant fields, lean fields, and seedling plots, using the fertilizer where it was most needed. When weeding and topdressing, they did so first to distant fields, then to nearby fields, first to Class III fields, then to Class I fields, so that the rice in poor and lean fields caught up with the rice in good and nearby fields. As a result, the entire brigade basically had no Class III rice, achieving a large-scale, balanced production increase.
    In addition, the large-scale promotion of the improved variety "Dwarf Sticky Rice" was also a reason for the overall production increase. Facts have proven that Dwarf Sticky Rice is an improved variety that is short-stemmed, fertilizer-resistant, not easily lodged, with dense, large, and heavy grains. Under the same land and management conditions, Dwarf Sticky Rice yields about 100 catties more per mu than other varieties.
    The key to the implementation of the above production measures lies in the strong leadership of the Party. Once the branch successfully tests a major measure for increasing production, it will resolutely implement it to the end. For example, the improved variety Dwarf Sticky Rice was first tested in 1955, in 1956 two teams tested it, and in 1957 every team tested it. After the trials, a considerable number of members felt that this improved variety was difficult to thresh, required a lot of fertilizer, and matured late, so they were unwilling to plant it. The branch did not waver because of this. In 1958, it focused on cultivating the Qin Village team to plant more of it. That year, the Qin Village team and the Beixi team competed. From seedling growth to harvesting, the Beixi team was always ahead. Even after the early-maturing and mid-maturing varieties were harvested, the Beixi team was still in the lead. But in the end, the Qin Village team harvested Dwarf Sticky Rice, and its yield surpassed the Beixi team in one fell swoop, achieving the final victory. The branch seized this typical example and launched a large-scale debate among the members, thereby establishing the prestige of Dwarf Sticky Rice. This year, more than 3,000 mu of early rice in the entire brigade were basically planted with Dwarf Sticky Rice.
    The branch's leadership in production is not just empty talk, but truly participating in production and leading production. Especially when tasks are tight and work encounters difficulties, cadres step forward to lead the members forward. For example, when eliminating Class III seedlings, fertilizer was lacking, the members were slacking off, and it looked like the opportunity would be missed. The branch decided at this critical juncture that cadres would take the lead in setting up experimental fields to eliminate Class III rice, and all seven full-time cadres in the brigade volunteered to serve as field chiefs for eliminating Class III rice. Through the efforts of the cadres and the masses, almost 100% of the Class III rice changed its appearance.

    改造自然　低产赶高产
    卖酒大队早稻平衡增产改变低产面貌
    本报讯　自合作化以来年年增产的广西玉林县小平山公社卖酒大队，今年早稻又获得了大面积高额丰产。这个大队共有早稻三千九百六十六亩，据已收割的二千八百二十七亩统计，平均亩产量比去年增加42％。现在这个大队已由低产贫穷的地方跃为玉林县高产富裕的地方了。
    卖酒大队的耕作地区过去是个严重干旱、土质贫瘠、低产贫穷的地方。这里过去三天不雨成小旱，五天不雨成大旱，全大队有73％的水田经常遭受旱灾威胁。合作化后，这个大队在党的领导下与自然作了顽强的斗争，逐步改变了自然面貌，年年增产。今年更令人兴奋的是：全大队早稻大面积平衡增产，各生产队之间的产量相差不远，条件较差的生产队已经赶上来了。忠良村过去是这个大队的穷村，现在亩产量比超产最高的覃村，不过相差二、三十斤。
    几年来大队党支部领导社员与自然作了顽强的斗争。他们首先抓住了水利工作，共修建了大小水库、陂坝、水塘、水渠共一百多处，使三千一百多亩受旱土地连年获得增产。在逐步克服干旱威胁的同时，对浅劣的土质也进行了顽强的斗争。覃村有一个出名的岭峡?，岭峡?两旁山峡冲刷下来的沙土，大量的掺在这十三亩多土地里。这些田土，干时是坚硬的泥团，渗水便变成极度胶粘的泥土，社员叫它“死泥”。1956年夏季，他们把切碎的麦秆拌石灰、牛粪放进田里，这年禾苗生长得比较好。1957年春施了大量的绿肥，秋收之后，又施用木薯地的半沙泥加沤熟的草皮，结果1958年全年产量比1955年改良土壤以前增加73％。
    这个大队在几年来改土工作的基础上，今年特别注意科学施肥。社员根据历年来的经验，今年大部分田都在深耕前后下足基肥，平均每亩下泥肥一百八十四担左右，在耙田插秧时每亩又下二三十担粪水。对田底瘦薄缺乏有机质的田，除实行禾秆还田之外，每亩还加施一千斤左右的绿肥。为了保证大面积丰收，这个大队开展了瘦田赶肥田、远田赶村边田、山冲田赶大垌田、秧地赶本田的四赶运动。在施肥时做到好肥精肥多施在远田、瘦田、秧地田上，把肥料用到最需要的地方去。在耘田追肥时，做到先远后近，先瘦后肥，先三类后一类，使坏田瘦田的禾赶上好田近田，因而整个大队基本上没有三类禾，获得大面积平衡增产。
    另外，大面积推广良种矮子粘，也是全面增产的一个原因。事实证明，矮子粘是矮生、耐肥、不易倒伏、粒密粒大粒重的良种，在同等土地同样管理的情况下，矮子粘要比其他品种每亩增产一百斤左右。
    以上生产措施所以能够贯彻执行，关键又在于党的坚强领导。支部对增产的重大措施一经试验成功，就一定坚决贯彻到底。比如矮子粘良种，1955年开始试种，1956年有两个队试种，1957年每队都试种。经过试种之后，有相当一部分社员觉得这个良种不好脱粒，需肥多，又迟熟，不愿种了。支部并没有因此而动摇，于1958年重点培养覃村队多种。这一年覃村队和北西队进行竞赛，从禾苗生长一直到收割，都是北西队占先，直到早熟、中熟种都收完了，还是北西队领先。但到最后，覃村队收矮子粘，产量却一举超过了北西队，取得最后胜利。支部抓住这一典型，在社员中开展大辩论，从此树立了矮子粘的威信，今年全队三千多亩早稻基本上都是种的矮子粘。
    支部领导生产不是空喊，而真正做到参加生产领导生产，特别是在任务紧张、工作遇到困难的时候，干部更挺身而出，领导社员前进。比如在消灭三类禾苗的时候，肥料缺乏了，社员松劲了，眼看时机就要错过，支部就在这一个关键时机决定干部带头搞消灭三类禾的试验田，全大队七个脱产干部都自报去充当消灭三类禾的垌长。经过干部带头和社员群众的奋战，三类禾几乎100％改变了面貌。
