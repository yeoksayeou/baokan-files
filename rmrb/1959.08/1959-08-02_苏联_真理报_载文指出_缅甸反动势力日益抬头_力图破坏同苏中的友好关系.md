    Soviet "Pravda" Article Points Out That Burmese Reactionary Forces Are Rising
    Trying to Undermine Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union and China
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st (TASS dispatch): The "Pravda" newspaper published an article on July 30 entitled "Where is Burma Going?", citing facts to illustrate the growing influence of reactionary forces in the Union of Burma.
    The article said that Burmese reactionaries have launched a noisy campaign to persecute domestic democratic organizations and some political leaders who advocate a neutral policy for Burma. The initiators of this campaign are promoting propaganda with far-reaching goals: to exploit domestic difficulties, undermine Burma's friendly relations with peace-loving countries, and thereby force Burma to abandon the path of neutralism. In this campaign, they even provoked the Soviet and Chinese embassies.
    The article pointed out that it is noteworthy that this reactionary movement has not been opposed by the ruling groups of the Union of Burma.
    The article said that, moreover, a Burmese representative participated in the so-called "Asian People's Anti-Communist League" conference held in Seoul. As is well known, the activities of this "organization" only serve the interests of imperialist forces across the ocean. For them, the slogan of "opposing communism" is merely a guise for realizing their colonial plans in Asia. It is also noteworthy that a Burmese representative also participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's military exercises held in Thailand earlier this year.
    The article said that it is not difficult to understand whose interests the provocative movement in Burma is serving. The "New York Herald Tribune," in commenting on the recent decision of the Burmese government to accept a "gift" of $37 million from the United States, emphasized that the fact that Burma accepted U.S. "aid" after refusing to accept U.S. "aid" for six years reflects an important change in the country's plans. The article said that this is not accidental.

### 苏联“真理报”载文指出  缅甸反动势力日益抬头  力图破坏同苏中的友好关系

    苏联“真理报”载文指出
    缅甸反动势力日益抬头
    力图破坏同苏中的友好关系
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”7月30日发表了一篇题为“缅甸向何处去”的文章，引用事实说明反动势力在缅甸联邦日益增长的影响。
    文章说，缅甸反动分子发动了一次喧嚷的运动，迫害国内民主组织和某些主张缅甸采取中立政策的政治领袖。这次运动的发起者的宣传叫嚷追随着深远的目的：利用国内的困难，破坏缅甸同爱好和平的国家的友好关系，进而迫使缅甸放弃中立主义的道路。在这次运动中，他们甚至对苏联和中国的大使馆进行挑衅。
    文章指出，引起注意的是这种反动运动没有受到缅甸联邦统治集团方面的反对。
    文章说，而且缅甸代表参加了在汉城举行的所谓“亚洲人民反共联盟”会议。众所周知，这个“组织”的活动只是为大洋对岸的帝国主义势力的利益服务的。而对他们来说，“反对共产主义”的口号只是实现他们在亚洲殖民主义计划的幌子而已。同时引起注意的是，一个缅甸代表还参加了今年初在泰国举行的东南亚条约组织的军事演习。
    文章说，不难理解在缅甸掀起的挑衅运动是为了谁的利益。“纽约先驱论坛报”在评论缅甸政府最近决定接受美国的“礼物”、三千七百万美元的时候强调说，缅甸在拒绝接受美国“援助”六年以后接受美“援”这一事实就反映了这个国家的计划的重要改变。文章说，这并不是偶然的。
