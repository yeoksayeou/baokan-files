    Glezos Appears on the Screen
    The Greek national hero, Glezos, when the Hitlerite bandits occupied Greece, on a dark night, he bravely climbed the ancient castle, tore down the Nazi swastika flag, and raised the national flag of his motherland. "World Views" No. 10 recorded the hero's cheerful, lively, and optimistic demeanor, as well as this famous ancient castle.
    The reactionary Greek government recently sentenced this national hero to a heavy prison term on trumped-up charges, and this despicable act has been strongly protested by peace-loving people all over the world.
      Every Profession Produces a Champion
    We have seen many theatrical and song and dance performances, but rarely have we seen technical performances by service industry employees. "News Briefs" No. 45 has a theme called "Technical Performances in the Service Industry." It not only aroused our great interest, but also gave us education and enlightenment.
    Wrapping tea is a delicate job, requiring accurate weighing, fast wrapping, and beautiful tying. The clerk Li Baozhen used two minutes and forty-five seconds to wrap twenty packages of tea, each weighing one qian and two fen and five li.
    The performance of rolling dumpling wrappers was mesmerizing. Single-handed expert Li Wanhe rolled one hundred and eight in three minutes, with movements as swift as flying. Double-handed experts rolled two at a time, making one hundred and thirty-six in two minutes. The most interesting was pulling noodles. The waiter Zhou Zijie, with his superb skills, pulled them quickly and thinly, instantly turning a large piece of dough into fine noodles like silver threads.
          Bird Island Scenery
    Bird Island in Qinghai Lake has been filmed and is now available to audiences in "News Briefs" No. 43.
    This island is so small that it seems to be swept away by the wind and waves on the lake at any time. But many birds still choose to "build" their homes here. From a distance, the island looks like one flowerbed after another in full bloom, and clusters of dense, dark bushes. Only when you get closer can you see that the white ones are seagulls, the black ones are cormorants, and there are also geese and other birds, all occupying their own areas in groups. The visit of guests from outside the island immediately caused a sensation in this bird kingdom. After a burst of flapping wings, the sky turned black, the sun was blocked, and the noise was deafening. But the female birds incubating eggs, with their noble maternal instincts, resolutely and fearlessly lie in their nests, without moving at all. Some chicks that have just hatched even dare to open their greedy yellow-edged mouths at the camera, screeching to beg for food.
    Their nest groups are lined up like dormitories. Some new nests are built on top of old nests, like buildings. The nests are filled with eggs of various colors, the speckled ones are seagull eggs, the white ones are goose eggs, so dense that it is almost impossible to take a step.
      Lazy People Make Dirty Pigs
    "Raising pigs" is usually associated with "dirtiness." But a dozen or so pig-raising girls in Yinshan Commune, Zizhong County, Sichuan, said it well: pigs are dirty because people are lazy. If you don't believe it, please see the short film "Pig-Raising Girls" recently released by New Film. The pig farm introduced in the film is as clean as a hospital and operates scientifically; the girls care for the pigs as nurses care for patients. One sow gave birth to fifteen piglets, but she only had twelve nipples, which were not enough to go around, and some piglets were often hungry. The girls established a "nursing group" for these poor little ones, finding sows with fewer piglets and more nipples to act as wet nurses. But the sows' reproductive capacity was not weak, and in the end there were still some piglets who could not get a nipple, so the girls used rubber nipples to feed them soy milk and glucose water. They helped the piglets develop good habits of bathing regularly and washing their hands and feet before meals. Soda and bleach are added to the bath; the piglets who bathe here are not only clean, but also gain weight. The disinfectant pool for washing hands and feet is set up at the entrance of the cafeteria, and the piglets cannot avoid it, ensuring clean hands and feet and clean food. Their lives are also orderly. As soon as the girls ring a bell, the big and small pigs will flock to the cafeteria from all directions. The film's author praised in the narration: "The girls love their work, and even if it is a small thing, they try their best to do it well." In this film, which lasts only ten minutes, we see the wonderful ingenuity of these pig-raising girls for the people's cause!

　　新闻纪录电影之窗

    格列索斯出现在银幕上
    希腊的民族英雄格列索斯，当希特勒匪帮占领希腊的时候，在一个漆黑的夜里，他英勇地爬上古城堡，扯下纳粹的卐字旗，升起了祖国的国旗，“世界见闻”第十号里纪录下了这位英雄愉快、活泼充满乐观主义的风采和这个著名的古城堡。
    希腊的反动政府最近以莫须有的罪名把这位民族英雄判处重刑投进监狱，这种卑鄙的行为已遭到全世界爱好和平人民的强烈抗议。
      行行出状元
    我们看过很多戏剧、歌舞的表演，却很少看过服务行业服务员们的技术表演。“新闻简报”第四十五号里，有一个主题叫“服务行业的技术表演”。它不仅引起我们很大的兴趣，而且也给了我们教育和启示。
    包茶叶是个细活，要秤得准，包得快，还要捆得美观。服务员李宝珍用二分四十五秒的时间，包了二十包茶叶，每包都是一钱二分五。
    撖饺子皮的表演使人看得入了迷。单撖能手李万和用三分钟的时间撖了一百零八个，动作迅速如飞，只见饺子皮不断在面板上划过。双撖能手一次撖两个，用两分钟的时间就撖了一百三十六个。最有趣的是抻面，服务员周子杰，手艺高强，他抻的又快、又细，转眼间就把一大块面抻成一根根银丝一样的细面条了。
          鸟岛风光
    青海湖的鸟岛已拍摄成电影，在“新闻简报”第四十三号中与观众见面。
    这个岛小得好像随时都可能被湖上的风浪卷走似的。但许多鸟类还是选择这里“建造”自己的家园。从远处看去，岛上好像有一片接一片盛开的花圃，一丛连一丛黑压压的灌木，走近了才看清白的是海鸥，黑的是鸬鹚，另外还有大雁等，都成群地各据一方。岛外客人的访问，立刻轰动这个鸟国，一阵飞响声之后，天空一片黑，太阳也被遮住了，鸣噪之声震耳欲聋。但正在孵蛋的雌鸟，崇高的母性使它们毅然无畏地伏在窝里，一动也不动。有些刚脱壳的小鸟竟敢冲着摄影机张开贪吃的黄边大嘴怪声地叫着索食。
    它们的窝群一排一排地真像是宿舍。有的新窝筑在旧窝上，跟楼房一样。窝里摆着各色各样的蛋，有花斑的是海鸥蛋，白的是大雁蛋，密密麻麻，几乎叫人迈不开步子。
      人懒猪才脏
    “养猪”通常和“肮脏”联在一起。但是四川资中县银山公社的十几个养猪姑娘说得好：猪脏因为人懒。不信请看新影最近发行的一部短片“养猪姑娘”。影片介绍的养猪场和医院一样干净、按科学办事；姑娘们对猪如同护士对病人一样关怀体贴。有一只母猪生了十五只小猪，它只有十二个奶头，分配不过来，有些小猪常常挨饿。姑娘们为这些小可怜成立了“哺乳组”，找那些仔少奶头多的母猪当奶妈。可是母猪的生殖力都不弱，最后还有一些分不到奶头的小猪，姑娘们就用橡皮奶头去喂豆浆、葡萄糖水。她们让小猪养成了平常爱洗澡、饭前都洗手脚的好习惯。浴池里放进苏打和漂白粉；在这里洗澡的小猪，干净不用说了，还增加体重。洗手脚的消毒池设在食堂门口，小猪不能不经过，手脚干净、食物清洁都有了保证。它们生活也有秩序，只要姑娘一摇铃，大猪小猪就会从四面八方一齐向食堂涌去。影片作者在解说词中赞美地说：“姑娘们热爱自己的工作，那怕是一点小事，都尽量把它做好。”在这部放映仅十分钟的影片里，使我们看见了这些养猪姑娘们对人民事业的美妙的匠心！
