Xinhua News Agency, New York: The major strike of 500,000 U.S. steelworkers, which began on July 15, has entered its fourth week. The joint labor-management negotiation meeting convened by the government has yet to yield any results. According to U.S. newspapers, there is no indication that the strike will end soon.

The steelworkers' major strike has already had a significant impact. The total loss from reduced steel production due to the strike over the past three weeks amounts to approximately $1 billion. In addition, production in the coal mining, rail transportation, and automobile transportation industries is rapidly declining. Sales in some retail sectors are also decreasing.

This newspaper reports: William Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party USA, published a statement in the American "Worker" newspaper on July 26, calling on American workers to unite and resolutely strive for the final victory of the steelworkers' strike.

In his statement, Foster first pointed out that the current unemployment of 500,000 steelworkers is due to steel bosses wanting to force workers to submit through starvation. He said: Employers are resorting to old tactics to force workers to bow to their will, giving up billions of dollars so that this money can return to factory owners in the form of profits. If workers raise objections to wages and working hours, steel bosses will force them to submit.

Foster then pointed out that this steel strike can and must be won. He said, "The large-scale labor movement has developed under the heroic struggles of workers. And in recent decades, no one has been as steadfast in struggle as the steelworkers."

He emphasized that the key to victory lies in the unity of the workers, and pointed out that this strike is not only a strike of steel mill workers but involves every American worker. Therefore, Foster pointed out, "This means that every trade union must provide all necessary support to ensure the strike's victory."

Finally, Foster emphasized that this strike is not limited to an ordinary trade union strike; importantly, it has political significance.

The American "Worker" newspaper published an article by Shield interviewing Foster on August 2nd.

The author wrote that Foster's health is gradually improving. The stroke in 1957 still affects the movement of his right side. But he can now move around the room relatively well with a cane. Although he is seventy-eight years old, his spirit is as full as ever. He is paying close attention to the news of the steelworkers' strike with great concern. When Foster talked to the author about the historical struggles of steelworkers in the past, he said, "Steelworkers are strongest when they have the support of other unions, and other unions are strongest when the steelworkers are organized."

    美国钢铁工人罢工进入第四周
    福斯特号召支持钢铁工人斗争
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：自7月15日开始的美国五十万钢铁工人的大罢工已进入了第四周。由政府召集的劳资联席谈判会议至今仍然没有取得任何结果。据美国报刊说，现在还没有任何迹象表明罢工将会很快结束。
    钢铁工人的大罢工已经产生很大的影响。总计三个星期来由于罢工而引起的钢铁减产的损失高达约十亿美元。此外，煤矿业、铁路运输、汽车运输等等行业的生产在急剧减少。某些零售业的买卖也在减少。
    本报讯　美国共产党主席威廉·福斯特7月26日在美国“工人周报”上发表声明，号召美国工人团结一致，坚决争取钢铁工人罢工的最后胜利。
    福斯特在声明中首先指出，目前五十万钢铁工人的失去工作，是由于钢铁老板们想用饥饿来迫使工人屈服。他说：雇主们正在玩弄老一套手法，迫使工人们屈从他们的意志，放弃数十亿美元，使这些钱以利润形式归厂主所有。如果工人们对工资和工作时间提出意见，钢铁老板就要迫使他们屈服。
    福斯特接着指出，这次钢铁罢工将能够取得胜利，而且也必须取得胜利。他说，“大规模的劳工运动是在工人的英勇斗争下发展起来的。而在近几十年中，还没有谁在斗争的坚定方面能比得上钢铁工人。”
    他强调胜利的关键取决于工人的团结，并指出，这次罢工不仅是钢铁厂工人的罢工，而是牵涉到每个美国工人的罢工。因此，福斯特指出，“这就意味着每一个工会都必须给予必要的全部支援，以便使罢工获胜。”
    最后，福斯特着重强调，这次罢工不限于是一次普通的工会罢工，重要的是它具有政治意义。
    8月2日美国“工人周报”刊载了希耳德访问福斯特的文章。
    作者写道，福斯特的健康情况在逐渐好转。1957年的中风仍然影响他的右半身的行动。但是他现在用一个拐棍可以比较好地在房间里走动，他虽然七十八岁了，但是精神仍然像过去任何时候一样的饱满。他以非常关切的心情注意着铁钢工人的罢工消息。福斯特对作者谈到过去钢铁工人的历史性斗争时说，“钢铁工人在得到其他工会支持时才是最强有力的，而其他工会在钢铁工人组织起来时也才是最强有力的。”
