One afternoon, Cai Shenghua, the Party Secretary of Daolin Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, returned from an emergency drought resistance meeting held at the commune and immediately inspected the canals of the entire brigade with Tan Youqi, a member of the general branch and production team leader. During the inspection, they found that water leakage on both sides of the water pump and excessive outflow were serious, which would reduce the irrigation of about dozens of mu of farmland. At the same time, Secretary Cai also heard suggestions from some people that if the canal was dredged for another one and a half li, the irrigation area could be increased from the original 900-plus mu to 1,250-plus mu. After discussing with the brigade cadres, Secretary Cai immediately convened a cadre meeting to discuss the dredging of the canal. After heated discussions, everyone agreed to dredge the canal for another one and a half li and decided to start construction immediately.

At this time, it was already past 10 o'clock in the evening. Secretary Cai, holding an iron shovel and a manure basket, led more than 30 cadres and commune members towards the construction site. As soon as they arrived at the construction site, people worked as hard as tigers descending the mountain, digging and carrying. Secretary Cai was both a commander and a combatant. After assigning tasks, he immediately joined in carrying earth. He carried more than 100 jin on each load, which many young men could not match. When the battle progressed to more than 2 o'clock in the morning, the canal was about to be completed. Suddenly, Secretary Cai's foot was bitten by a snake, causing severe pain, numbness in his legs, and dizziness. At this time, Tan Yunsheng, the work group leader nearby, quickly helped Secretary Cai to rest for a while. Secretary Cai washed the wound with water, tied it with a cloth, and immediately jumped up again, continuing to fight. They fought hard for another hour or so, and the canal was completed, much to the joy of the commune members.

After a while, the quality inspector of the brigade engineering team came and conducted a comprehensive inspection of the entire 800-meter-long canal. The inspection proved that it fully met the quality standards. Only then did Secretary Cai leave the construction site with everyone. It was already the next morning when he returned to the brigade headquarters. The commune members wanted Secretary Cai to go to the health center to apply medicine and rest at home. Secretary Cai verbally agreed, but in reality, he did not go to the health center, but secretly ran to the canal to help the commune members with waterwheels.

    抗旱前线的蔡书记
    一天下午，湖南宁乡县道林公社党委书记蔡声华，从公社开完紧急抗旱会议回来后，马上同总支委员、生产队长谭尤其检查了全大队的渠道。检查中发现抽水机两旁漏水和外流水比较严重，大约要减少几十亩田的灌溉。同时，蔡书记还听到一些群众建议，如果把这条渠道再疏通一里半长，可由原来灌溉九百多亩增加到一千二百五十多亩。蔡书记同大队干部商量后，便立即召开一个干部会议，讨论疏通渠道的事。经过大伙的热烈讨论，一致同意将渠道再疏通一里半长，并决定立即动工。
    这时，已经是晚上十点多钟。蔡书记拿着铁铣、粪箕，带领三十多名干部和社员向工地前进。一到工地，人们如同猛虎下山一样，紧张地干了起来，挖的挖，挑的挑。蔡书记既是指挥员又是个战斗员，他分派了活以后，马上参加担土。他每担挑有一百多斤，许多小伙子都挑不过他。战斗进行到深夜两点多钟的时候，渠道快修通了，蔡书记的脚忽然被蛇咬了一口，痛得非常厉害，两脚发麻，头也晕了。这时，在近旁的作业组长谭云生连忙扶住蔡书记，让他休息一会。蔡书记用水洗一洗伤口，拿布一扎，马上又跳了起来，继续投入战斗。他们又苦战了一个多钟头，渠道修通了，社员们高兴得跳了起来。
    过了一会，大队工程质量检查员来了，将整个八百米长的渠道进行全面检查，检查证明完全合乎质量标准。这时，蔡书记才同大伙儿一起离开了工地。回到大队部时，已是第二天的早晨了。社员们要蔡书记到卫生所去上药，并在家休息一下。蔡书记口头上答应，实际没有去卫生所，而是偷偷地跑上水渠帮助社员车水去了。
