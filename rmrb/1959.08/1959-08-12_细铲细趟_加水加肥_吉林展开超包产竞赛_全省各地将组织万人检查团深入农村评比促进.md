　　Changchun, August 11th, This Newspaper -- A production competition to strive to exceed this year's contracted production targets is vigorously unfolding in the vast rural areas of Jilin Province.

　　Currently, crops in Jilin Province are generally growing well, and the people in various places are confidently fighting in the fields to exceed the contracted production targets by 10%, 20%, or 30%.

　　The seven counties that initiated the "Surpass Production" competition, Yongji, Yushu, Daan, Jiaohe, Liuhe, Huai’de, and Helong, have already sounded the drums of war, focusing on the late-stage field management of major autumn crops. The Jiaohe County Party Committee has proposed different production increase targets based on different crops and different areas. County Party Secretaries and County Heads personally took charge and organized joint inspection teams of four levels of cadres from the county, communes, management districts, and production teams to help each production team determine the plots of land for exceeding the contracted production targets. Now, the six communes in the county have proposed exceeding the contracted production land by more than 96,000 mu. In Yongji County, the Party committees of all People's Communes have mobilized the masses to extensively discuss how to exceed production. By the end of July, the area of high-yield fields in the county had increased from the original 200,000 mu to more than 600,000 mu, among which the high-yield fields in Jiangmifeng and Kouqian communes had increased by two times compared to the original.

　　On the basis of the original 200,000 mu of high-yield fields that have already been hoed three times and weeded four times, the People's Communes are giving the 600,000 mu of high-yield fields one more hoeing and weeding, one more application of fertilizer, ridging sorghum and millet in the autumn, artificially pollinating corn, removing smartweed, and pulling weeds and pinching the tops of soybeans. In order to do a good job in the "Surpass Contracted Production" campaign, the Wanchang People's Commune has established high-yield field management committees in all thirty management districts.

　　Shuangliao County is carrying out a "Surpass Contracted Production" competition with the content of "hoeing whenever there is grass, weeding whenever possible" and "vigorously accumulating fertilizer and topdressing." A mass movement of competition has formed among the communes, management districts, and production teams to compare yields, compare measures, and compare enthusiasm, chasing each other forward. The county has organized a year-round fertilizer accumulation army of more than 10,000 people, using spare time in the morning and evening and during rainy days to accumulate fertilizer and compost manure. More than 180,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been upgraded to second-class seedlings due to processing and fertilization. In Yushu County, known as the "Land of Soybeans," in order to achieve more hoeing, more weeding, meticulous hoeing, meticulous weeding, more watering, and more fertilization, the method of "determining work based on land, recording points based on ridges, and paying based on points" has been implemented, greatly stimulating the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. More than 90,000 people in the county are engaged in soybean field management, and labor efficiency has increased by about 30% compared to the original.

　　(Another dispatch) In order to promote the rapid development of the "Surpass Production" competition, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on July 10th to organize a province-wide ten-thousand-person agricultural inspection team, requiring the secretaries of the Party committees of all cities, districts (autonomous prefectures), counties, and communes to take charge and immediately take action to carry out a large-scale inspection, evaluation, and competition campaign.

　　The notice of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that in the inspection and evaluation work, attention should be paid to understanding the ideological situation of cadres and the masses in the "Surpass Production" campaign, thoroughly implementing policies, and overcoming certain right-leaning, slackening emotions. It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and research, effectively solve problems, pay attention to grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, hold good on-site meetings, summarize advanced experiences, establish pacesetters, and promote the overall situation. The inspection should also focus on understanding whether the "Surpass Contracted Production" targets and measures have been implemented.

　　Currently, the first batch of inspection teams organized by the Provincial Party Committee have gone to Helong, Huaide, and other places to conduct inspections.

　　细铲细趟　加水加肥
　　吉林展开超包产竞赛
　　全省各地将组织万人检查团深入农村评比促进
    本报长春11日电　力争超过今年包产指标的生产竞赛，正在吉林省广大农村蓬勃展开。
    当前吉林省农作物一般生长良好，各地人民正在信心百倍地为超过包产指标一成、二成、三成而奋战田间。
    超产竞赛的发起县永吉、榆树、大安、蛟河、柳河、怀德、和龙七个县已擂起战鼓，紧抓大秋作物后期田间管理。蛟河县委按照不同作物不同面积，提出了不同的增产指标。并由县委书记、县长亲自挂帅，组织了县、公社、管理区、生产队四级干部的联合检查组，帮助各生产队确定超包产指标的地块。现在，全县六个公社提出超包产土地达九万六千多亩。永吉县各人民公社党委都发动群众广泛进行了如何超产的讨论。全县到7月末，高产田的面积已由原来的二十万亩，增加到六十多万亩，其中，江米峰、口前两公社的高产田，比原来增加了两倍。
    各人民公社正在原有二十万亩高产田已做到三铲四趟的基础上，再给六十万亩高产田多铲趟一遍，多追一遍肥，高粱、谷子放一次秋垅，苞米进行人工授粉、除蓼，大豆拔大草、掐尖。万昌人民公社为了搞好超包产运动，三十个管理区都成立了高产田管理委员会。
    双辽县开展以“有草就铲，能趟就趟”和“大搞积肥、追肥”为内容的超包产竞赛，各公社、管理区、生产队之间，形成了比产量、比措施，比干劲的你追我赶的群众运动。全县组织了一万多人的常年积肥大军，利用早晚空间和风雨天积肥沤粪，已有十八万多亩三类苗由于加工加肥，升为二类苗。素称“大豆之乡”的榆树县为了做到多铲多趟、细铲细趟、加水加肥，实行了“以地定工、以垅记分、以分付酬”的办法，大大的激发了广大社员的劳动积极性，全县投入大豆田间管理的有九万多人，劳动效率比原来提高30％左右。
    又电　为了推动超产竞赛运动迅速发展，中共吉林省委已于7月10日发出组织全省农业万人检查团的通知，要求各市、地（州）委、县委、公社党委书记挂帅，立即行动，开展大规模的检查评比竞赛运动。
    中共吉林省委的通知指出，在检查评比工作中，应注意了解干部和群众在超产运动中的思想情况，深入贯彻政策，克服某些右倾松劲情绪。要深入调查研究，切实解决问题，注意抓两头带中间，开好现场会议，总结先进经验，树立标兵，推动全面。检查中还应着重了解超包产指标和措施是否落实。
    目前，省委组织的首批检查组已分别深入到和龙、怀德等地进行检查。
