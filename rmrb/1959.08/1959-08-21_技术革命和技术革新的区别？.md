    The Difference Between Technological Revolution and Technological Innovation?
    Comrades Xiao Da from Beijing and Zhang Jihui from Sichuan Province wrote to inquire about the difference between the terms "technological revolution" and "technological innovation" that frequently appear in newspapers. Comrades Xiao and Zhang:
    There is a distinction between technological revolution and technological innovation. "Technological revolution" is presented as a relatively large historical task for a period. It requires a major revolution in the technological foundation of all sectors of our national economy, and it requires a comprehensive leap in technology from a qualitative perspective. For example, replacing manual labor with machinery, replacing mechanization with automation, replacing steam with electricity, and so on. Technological innovation is also a technological change, but it is gradual and partial. For example, workers only reform the local structure of a machine, or only innovate a certain part or tool. Although this kind of innovation improves production efficiency, it neither causes the technological transformation of the entire production process nor fundamentally changes the structure of a machine. From the perspective of a machine or a production process, each innovation is only a quantitative change in technological change, which prepares the conditions for qualitative change.
    However, technological innovation and technological revolution are inextricably linked. This is because their purpose is to develop productive forces through technological change. Technological change can go from low to high; it can leap from continuous local innovation to comprehensive revolutionary development. When quantitative changes in technology reach a certain level, they will inevitably lead to qualitative changes. Therefore, from a developmental point of view, technological innovation is the germ of technological revolution. (Editor)

    技术革命和技术革新的区别？
    北京市萧达同志和四川省张集辉同志来信提出报纸上经常出现“技术革命”和“技术革新”的词句，不知二者的区别何在？萧、张二位同志：
    技术革命和技术革新是有区别的。“技术革命”是作为一个时期比较大的历史任务提出的，它要求我们国民经济各部门的技术基础来个大革命，要求技术上从质的方面来个全面飞跃的突变。如以机械代替手工劳动，以自动化代替机械化，以电气代替蒸汽，等等。技术革新也是技术上的变革、但是渐变性的和局部的。例如，一台机器，工人只改革其局部的结构，或者只革新某一个部件、工具等。这种革新，虽然提高了生产效率，但既没有引起生产过程整个技术的变革，也没有根本改变一台机器的结构。从一台机器、一个生产过程来看，每一次革新，只是技术变革中量的变化，它为质的变化准备条件。
    但技术革新和技术革命又有不可分割的联系。这是因为它们的目的都是为了通过技术的变革，发展生产力。技术上的变革可以由低级到高级；可以从局部的不断革新飞跃为全面的革命性的发展。技术上量的变化到一定程度时，必然会引起质的变化。所以，从发展的观点来看，技术革新又是技术革命的萌芽。（编者）
