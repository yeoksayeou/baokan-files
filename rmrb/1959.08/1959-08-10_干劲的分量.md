    The Weight of Drive
    Kong Sang
    The changes in production at the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory after overcoming the slack mood among some cadres once again proves a truth: under certain material and technical conditions, what determines the quality of production is none other than people's revolutionary drive. With sufficient drive, things are done vigorously, achieving more, faster, better, and more economically; when the drive is slack, things are done coldly and quietly (relatively speaking), resulting in less, slower, worse, and more costly outcomes.

    Why is there such a big difference in the appearance of production between having drive and lacking it? This is because with sufficient drive, difficulties in the way forward can be overcome smoothly, while with slack drive, people sigh and complain in the face of difficulties. On the road of socialist construction, there are many favorable factors, but also some unfavorable factors. This is a natural phenomenon in the development of objective things. Our task is to see both the favorable and unfavorable factors, and to muster enough drive to transform unfavorable factors into favorable ones. For example, some enterprises felt that raw materials could not meet their needs during the Great Leap Forward, while at the same time there was waste in production. Usable scraps and waste materials were not fully utilized, and savings were not made where they could have been. Our task is to continue to muster enough drive, resolutely rely on the masses, summarize experience, improve our work, actively increase the production of raw materials, and at the same time use raw materials reasonably and economically, turning the unfavorable factor of insufficient raw materials into a favorable one. The practice of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory tells us that by doing so, unfavorable factors are indeed gradually reduced, and the favorable factors for achieving a leap in production are indeed increased.

    If there is insufficient drive, difficulties are not analyzed, unfavorable factors are exaggerated, favorable factors are reduced, or even favorable factors are not seen at all, then the courage and confidence to move forward will be lost in the face of difficulties. In this way, not only will new experiences not be actively summarized and promoted to overcome unfavorable factors, but even past effective experiences will not be adhered to, and production scheduling and inspection will also be relaxed. As a result, the original favorable factors will be reduced, and unfavorable factors will increase. Originally, the problem was only insufficient raw materials, but due to slackness, even with raw materials available, products of good quality and low cost cannot be produced. This is the harm of right-leaning sentiments, and we must prevent and overcome such right-leaning sentiments at all times.

    The comrades of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory, through the production practice in July, understood the weight of revolutionary drive in the Great Leap Forward, understood that "drive must be fully mustered at all times, and we must strive to be upstream at all times," and also understood how to overcome the fear of difficulty and slack mood of some cadres. That is, to convene a factory-wide meeting of party members and cadres, and a meeting of employee representatives, to lay out everyone's thoughts, and to illuminate them with the spirit of the General Line. The brilliance of the General Line illuminated the thoughts of the cadres and workers of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory, enabling them to regain their drive, and to change the face of production in just ten days. The experience of the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory is a mirror, and it is useful for many factories and mines.

    干劲的分量
    孔桑
    北京起重机器厂克服了部分干部中的松劲情绪以后的生产变化，再一次证实一个真理：在一定的物质技术条件下，决定生产好坏的，不是别的，正是人们的革命干劲。鼓足干劲，就轰轰烈烈，做到多快好省；松了劲，就冷冷清清（相对地说），只能少慢差费。
    为什么在干劲一鼓一松之间，生产面貌就有这样大的差别呢？这是因为干劲鼓足了，才能顺利地克服前进中的困难，松了劲，就会在困难面前唉声叹气。在社会主义建设的道路上，有着许多有利的因素，同时也有着一些不利的因素。这是客观事物发展中的必然现象。我们的任务是既要看到有利因素，也要看到不利因素，并且鼓足干劲，变不利因素为有利因素。例如，有些企业在大跃进中，一方面感到原材料不能满足需要，另一方面在生产中又存在着浪费现象，该利用的边料、废料没有充分利用，该节省的没有节省。我们的任务，就是继续鼓足干劲，坚决依靠群众，总结经验，改进工作，积极增产原材料，同时合理地节约地使用原材料，把原材料不足的不利因素变为有利因素。北京起重机器厂的实践告诉我们，这样做了，不利因素确实是逐渐减少了，实现生产跃进的有利因素确是增加了。
    如果干劲不足，对困难不加分析，夸大不利因素，缩小有利因素，甚至看不见有利因素，那末在困难面前就会丧失前进的勇气和信心。这样，不但不积极总结和推行新经验去克服不利因素，连过去行之有效的经验也不坚持，生产调度、生产检查也放松了。于是，原有的有利因素反而会减少，而不利因素却会增加。本来只是原材料不充裕，由于松了劲，现在有了原材料，也生产不出质量好的成本低的产品来了。这就是右倾情绪的危害，我们要时时刻刻防止和克服这种右倾情绪。
    北京起重机器厂的同志，通过7月份的生产实践，懂得了革命干劲在跃进中的分量，懂得了“干劲必须时时鼓足，必须时时力争上游”，同时还懂得了怎样克服部分干部的畏难松劲情绪。这就是召开全厂党员干部大会、职工代表大会，把大家的思想摊开来，用总路线的精神来照一照。总路线的光辉照亮了北京起重机器厂干部和工人的思想，使他们重新鼓起了干劲来，并且在短短的十天内就改变了生产面貌。北京起重机器厂的经验是一面镜子，它对于许多厂矿企业来说，都是有用的。
