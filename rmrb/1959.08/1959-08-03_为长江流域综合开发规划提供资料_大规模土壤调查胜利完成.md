Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd: The Yangtze River Basin soil survey has been successfully completed after nearly three years of effort.

This large-scale soil survey was mainly conducted to provide data for the grand comprehensive development plan of the Yangtze River Basin. Currently, the results compiled by the surveyors include: a 1:1,000,000 scale soil distribution map and soil improvement zoning map of the Yangtze River Basin; 1:200,000 scale soil distribution maps and soil improvement zoning maps of areas such as the Nanyang Basin, Jianghan Plain, and Xiang-Gan Hilly Region, as well as soil survey reports for these areas. In addition, based on the determination of soil moisture physical properties in the plains and hilly areas, they have provided data on the irrigation water volume of major soils in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This long and vast survey is also a major contribution to China's soil science. In addition to obtaining the above valuable results, the surveyors also increased the classification of several soils based on the survey results and corrected past inappropriate soil divisions and soil names.

The Yangtze River Basin soil survey began in 1956. This survey received specific guidance and assistance from Soviet experts. In addition to the staff of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, participants in the survey included the Soil Survey Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, teachers and students from Huazhong Agricultural College, Nanjing Agricultural College, and Southwest Agricultural College, as well as personnel from relevant departments in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. Over nearly three years, they traveled almost everywhere in the Yangtze River Basin.

    为长江流域综合开发规划提供资料
    大规模土壤调查胜利完成
    据新华社武汉2日电　长江流域土壤调查工作经过近三年的努力，最近已胜利完成。
    这次大规模的土壤调查，主要是为了给宏伟的长江流域综合开发规划提供资料。目前，调查人员已经整理出的成果有：一百万分之一的长江流域土壤分布图和土壤改良分区图；南阳盆地、江汉平原及湘赣丘陵区等地区的二十万分之一的土壤分布图和土壤改良分区图，以及这些地区的土壤调查报告。此外，他们还根据对平原和丘陵区土壤水分物理性的测定，提出了长江中下游地区主要土壤灌溉用水量的资料。这次长期而浩繁的调查，对我国土壤科学也是一个重大贡献。调查人员除了取得上述宝贵成果以外，还根据调查的结果增加了若干土壤的分类，修正了过去不恰当的土壤划分和土壤名称。
    长江流域土壤调查工作是从1956年开始的。这次调查，得到了苏联专家的具体指导和帮助。参加调查的除长江流域规划办公室的职工以外，还有中国科学院土壤调查队，华中农学院、南京农学院和西南农学院的师生，以及四川、湖北、湖南、江西、浙江、江苏、安徽等省有关部门的人员。他们在近三年时间里，几乎跑遍了长江流域的每个地方。
