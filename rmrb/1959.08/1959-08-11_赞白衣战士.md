　　Ode to the White-Clad Warriors

　　During the Crimean War between England, France, and Russia from 1854 to 1856, there was an English nurse named Florence Nightingale. She worked day and night on the battlefield for the neglected soldiers, accomplishing great deeds. Since then, people have associated the title "warrior" with medical personnel in white coats.

　　In Henan Province, 50,000 medical personnel have joined the fight against drought. This is a battle waged against nature. Our white-clad warriors are with the drought-fighting army; wherever they go, the white-clad warriors go. They treat illnesses when they arise and fight the drought when there are no patients. They also go deep into the fields to promote hygiene knowledge, compiling manuals on heatstroke prevention, first aid, and hygiene to arm rural health workers. Some white-clad warriors help communes train cooks to ensure the drought-fighting teams eat well, and eat clean and hygienic food. In short, they pay attention to everything that affects the health of the drought-fighting army, striving to do everything possible.

　　In our country, there is not just one Florence Nightingale, but tens of thousands of them. They are not simply motivated by compassion and humanitarianism, but by a great ideal that closely links them with the working people. The victory in the fight against drought is their own victory. They have thus fearlessly entered the ranks of this heroic battle, excellently completing their combat tasks. In our country's great epic of building socialism and fighting against nature, our white-clad warriors will leave an even more glorious page.

　　赞白衣战士
    在一八五四到一八五六年的克里米亚的英法和俄国战争中，英国有个女护士叫南丁格尔。她在战场上，为无人顾怜的大兵日以继夜地工作，立下了功勋。从这以后，人们把穿白衣的医护人员同“战士”这个英雄的称呼联系起来了。
    河南省有五万名医务人员投入抗旱斗争。这是一场向大自然开火的战斗。我们的白衣战士和抗旱大军一起，他们到哪儿，白衣战士就到哪儿。有病看病，没有病就抗旱。他们还深入田间宣传卫生知识，编写了有关防暑、急救、卫生等知识手册，来武装农村的保健员。有些白衣战士帮助公社训练炊事员，保证抗旱大队吃好，吃的干净卫生。总之，一切对抗旱大军身体健康的事，他们都注意到了，千方百计去做。
    在我们的国家里，不只是一个南丁格尔，而是有成千成万的南丁格尔。他们不是简单地出于同情心和人道主义，而是有一个伟大的理想，把他们同劳动人民紧密结合在一起。抗旱斗争的胜利，就是他们自己的胜利。他们就是这样毫无愧色地走入这个英雄的战斗行列，出色地完成了自己的战斗任务。在我国建设社会主义向自然开战的伟大史诗中，我们的白衣战士将留下更光辉的一页。
