The climatic conditions this spring were very unfavorable for the growth of hemp crops. At that time, the southern hemp areas had continuous rain, which affected the timely sowing and seedling growth of kenaf. The northern hemp areas suffered from prolonged drought, which also affected the seedling growth of hemp and flax. However, thanks to the better field management, the growth of hemp crops in various places is generally good. As long as we strengthen the late-stage field management and pay attention to the retting and washing techniques, we can increase the yield per unit area and improve the fiber quality.

	Promote Late-Stage Growth of Kenaf

The characteristic of late-stage growth of hemp plants is lush branches and leaves, and rapid upward growth, which can easily cause diseases, insect pests, and wind damage. Therefore, the focus of field management is to promote the continued upward growth of hemp plants and prevent disasters. The specific measures are:

	① Ensure Sufficient Water and Fertilizer. At present, the kenaf plants are entering the budding stage and need a large amount of nutrients and water. At this time, topdressing quick-acting fertilizer once or twice according to the growth of the hemp field is needed. Apply 15 to 20 catties of ammonium sulfate (or 10 to 15 dan of human manure) mixed with 10 to 15 catties of potassium sulfate (or 400 to 500 catties of soil manure and pond mud) per mu. At the same time, combine topdressing with irrigation to ensure sufficient water and fertilizer, so as to delay the flowering period of hemp plants, prolong the vegetative growth period, make the hemp stalks continue to elongate and thicken, and increase the thickness of the hemp bark. Although kenaf is resistant to waterlogging, it also affects the growth of hemp plants after being submerged. Therefore, hemp fields should also pay attention to timely drainage in the later stage.

	② Prevent Diseases and Insect Pests. The main diseases of kenaf in the later stage are stem blight of long-pod varieties and anthracnose of round-pod varieties. In terms of cultivation measures, the methods to reduce the harm of pathogens are: applying a mixture of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and organic nitrogen fertilizer, increasing the application of plant ash to enhance the disease resistance of hemp plants; using bamboo poles and hemp ropes in the ridge ditch to stagger and divide the hemp fields for sun-drying, improving the ventilation and light transmission conditions of hemp fields; and removing small hemp plants to reduce the chance of disease infection in hemp fields. In terms of chemical control, continuous spraying of equal-volume Bordeaux mixture for two to three times has the greatest effect on the control of stem blight. Hemp fields with particularly severe stem blight should be harvested early to avoid affecting the fiber quality. The main insect pests in the later stage of kenaf growth are corn borers, looper caterpillars, cutworms, and scarabs. A mixture of 6% wettable 666 and 25% DDT in a 1:1 ratio (every catty of liquid is mixed with 200 to 300 catties of water) can be sprayed continuously. Spraying a 1:200 lead arsenate solution has a control effect on cutworms and looper caterpillars.

	③ Prevent Lodging. In the late stage of kenaf growth, the plants are tall, and after heavy wind and rain, they are prone to tilting, lodging, or twisting of the tops with each other. Therefore, wooden stakes should be driven around the hemp field or on the edges of the ridges, and pulled-up clumsy hemp or hemp plants that do not grow well, or straw ropes should be used to surround the hemp field at four or five feet high to prevent lodging. After rain, the tilted hemp plants should be straightened, and the twisted hemp plants should be untied to allow them to grow normally.

Harvest the Second Crop of Ramie and Cultivate the Third Crop

Ramie is an asexually propagated perennial crop that is harvested three times a year. It is now approaching the harvest season of the second crop of ramie. We must harvest the second crop of ramie well and cultivate the third crop of ramie well. The specific methods are:

	① Timely Harvest. Ramie is a highly seasonal crop. The growing period of each crop of ramie is very short, about 90 days for the first crop, 45 to 50 days for the second crop, and 70 to 80 days for the third crop. If the hemp stalks are not harvested in time after the fiber development of the hemp plants reaches the mature stage, the stalks will lack moisture, and the hemp bark will be attached to the bone, which will not only make it difficult to strip the hemp, but also reduce the fiber yield of this season; it will also affect the growth of the next crop of ramie. When the stem color of most hemp plants changes from green to yellowish-brown and appears in the middle, it indicates that the fiber has matured. At this time, it is necessary to organize labor to carry out the "four fast" work of hemp harvesting: fast beating of hemp, fast cutting of bone, fast weeding, and fast topdressing. Strive to strip the hemp wherever it is, cut the bone wherever it is, and weed and topdress wherever it is. This is conducive to the harvest of the second crop of ramie, and also prepares good development conditions for the growth of the third crop as soon as possible.

	② Topdressing to Prevent Drought. The characteristic of the growth of the third crop of ramie is that it elongates very quickly in the early stage and needs sufficient nutrients and water. Therefore, immediately after the second crop of ramie is harvested, a large amount of fertilizer should be topdressed. Two to three weeks after growth, the hemp plants begin to bud and consume a lot of nutrients, so topdressing should also be applied once before budding to increase the nutrients needed for the vegetative growth of hemp plants. Four to five weeks later, the elongation of hemp plants slows down and enters the fiber maturation and development stage. At this time, topdressing is still required to promote the thickening of the hemp bark. According to the characteristics of ramie's particularly developed root system and strong fertilizer absorption, topdressing should be more first and less later, so as to give full play to the fertilizer effect. The amount of topdressing for the third crop is 20 to 30 catties of ammonium sulfate (or 15 to 20 dan of human manure), 100 to 150 catties of decomposed cake fertilizer, 20 to 30 dan of pig and cattle manure, and 200 to 300 catties of plant ash per mu for the first time. The second time, apply 10 to 15 catties of ammonium sulfate and 10 catties of potassium sulfate per mu. The third time, apply 10 catties of ammonium sulfate and potassium sulfate per mu. If there is a drought during the growing period of the third crop, irrigation, mulching, and soil cultivation and other drought prevention measures must be combined with topdressing.

	③ Prevent Insects and Wind. The main insect pests that harm the third crop of ramie are noctuid moths, swallowtail butterflies, and sulfur butterflies. Newly hatched noctuid moths and swallowtail butterfly larvae can be killed very effectively by spraying 6% wettable 666 one catty mixed with 200 catties of water before they are dispersed; when the larvae have dispersed or are old, the drug resistance is enhanced, and 9,000 to 10,000 parts per million of 1605 should be used for spraying. When the sulfur butterfly larvae begin to wrap the leaves or have wrapped the leaves, 9,000 to 10,000 parts per million of 1605 should be used for spraying. Ramie plants elongate rapidly, and the stems are tender and weak. When there are winds of level 5 or 6 or above, either the hemp leaves and stems are scratched, affecting the growth of ramie and reducing the fiber quality, or the hemp stalks are broken, or large areas of lodging are formed, resulting in a serious reduction in production. Therefore, wind prevention is one of the important measures to ensure a bumper harvest of ramie.

Master Hemp Retting Techniques

If hemp is harvested too early, the fiber is not fully developed and the yield is low; if it is harvested too late, not only is the fiber coarse and hard and the quality is poor, but also because the male hemp dries up and dies, it will increase the difficulty of retting and washing, and reduce the yield. The appropriate harvest period is at the peak flowering period of male hemp. At harvest, the harvest area should be determined according to the manpower and the size of the hemp land, so as to harvest and ret on the same day, and ret as much as is harvested, so that the hemp stalks are not exposed to the sun. The hemp stalks that are exposed to the sun and turn yellow will produce hemp with poor color and poor quality. At harvest, some people pull it up by hand and then cut the roots, while others use a sickle to cut it level with the ground. No matter which method is used, the hemp roots should not be left too long to avoid reducing the yield. After harvesting, remove the hemp leaves, then classify them according to the size of the hemp plants, and bundle them into hemp bundles with a diameter of about five inches for retting. Hemp is the fiber crop with the strongest retting and washing techniques, and clear water should be used for hemp retting. Stones, wooden sticks or gravel should be used to press the hemp, otherwise the fiber quality will be damaged. The time required for hemp retting varies depending on the water temperature at the time of retting in different places. After the hemp stalks are put into the water, various places should check them at any time according to the water temperature conditions. When the water appears viscous, the hemp stalks are covered with mucus, and the whole plant is covered with small bubbles, it is a sign that the retting is good. At this time, it must be taken out as soon as possible for rinsing and drying.

Improve Flax Fiber Quality

The appropriate harvest period for flax is when most of the hemp plants have more than five green capsules. It should not be harvested too late, otherwise it is easy to form iron root charred tip hemp, which reduces the fiber quality. The fiber of the flax root cortex is as soft and easy to use as the above-ground part after retting. Therefore, flax should be pulled up with its roots when harvested, and retted with its roots. After the hemp plants are harvested, they must be dried for one to two days, and then bundled for retting, so that the hemp plants are easy to mature consistently, and it is also easy to remove the hemp leaves and soil from the roots, which is convenient for retting. When retting hemp, the hemp bundles should not be stacked too thickly, the deep water should not exceed five feet, and the shallow water should not exceed three feet. The hemp bundles should be pressed into the water by about five inches. After the hemp is retted, it should be checked frequently. When the epidermis of the hemp plant turns yellow, the phloem and xylem are easily separated, the epidermis is washed off, and the fiber is white and mesh-like, it means that the retting is mature, and the hemp can be peeled.

    麻田的后期管理和麻的沤制技术
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    今年春季的气候条件，对麻类作物生长很不利。当时南方麻区阴雨连绵，影响黄洋麻的适时播种和苗期生长；北方麻区则长期天旱，大麻、?麻的苗期生长也受到影响。但由于田间管理工作做得较好，目前各地麻类作物的生长情况一般还不错，只要加强后期田间管理和注意沤洗技术，是可以提高单位面积产量和改进纤维品质的。
      促进黄洋麻后期生长
    麻株后期生长的特点是枝叶繁茂，上长快，容易引起病虫风害，因此田间管理工作的重点是促进麻株继续上长，防止灾害发生。具体措施是：
    ①做到水肥两足。目前黄洋麻植株生长正进入着蕾阶段，需要大量的养分和水分，这个时候要根据麻田生长情况，追施速效性肥一至两次。每亩用硫铵十五至二十斤（或人粪尿十至十五担）混合硫酸钾十至十五斤（或土粪、塘泥四百至五百斤）施下，同时结合追肥进行灌溉，做到水肥两足，以延迟麻株开花期，加长营养生长期，使麻秆继续伸长和加粗，增加麻皮厚度。黄麻虽能抗涝，但水淹后，也影响麻株生长，因此后期麻田还要注意及时排水。
    ②防病防虫。黄麻后期的主要病害有长果种的茎斑病及圆果种的炭疽病。在栽培措施上，减轻病菌为害的办法有：混合追施无机氮肥和有机氮肥，增施草木灰，以增强麻株抗病能力；在畦沟内采用插竹杆拉麻绳办法进行分期分畦晒麻，改进麻田通风透光条件；拔除细小麻株，减少麻田染病机会。在药剂防治上，用等量式波尔多液连续喷治两至三次，对茎斑病的防治收效最大。茎斑病发生特别严重的麻田，要提早收获，以免影响纤维品质。黄洋麻生长后期的主要虫害为玉米螟、造桥虫、夜盗虫及金龟子等，可用6％可湿性666和25％滴滴涕一比一混合药（液每斤兑水二百至三百斤）连续喷射。喷射一比二百的砒酸铅液，对夜盗虫和造桥虫有防治效果。
    ③，防倒伏。黄洋麻生长后期，植株高大，大风雨后，容易倾斜、倒伏或发生梢部互相扭结的现象，因此在麻田四周或畦边应该打木桩，用拔起的笨麻或生长不好的麻株或草绳，在麻株四、五尺高处围麻田一周，以防止倒伏。雨后须将倾斜麻株扶直，梢部扭结麻株应解开，使之正常生长。
    收好二季苎麻培育三麻
    苎麻为无性繁殖的多年生作物，一年收获三次。目前快近二麻收获季节，要收好二季苎麻，培育好三季苎麻。具体办法是：
    ①及时收获。苎麻是季节性很强的作物，每季麻的生长期很短，头麻九十天左右，二麻四十五至五十天，三麻七十至八十天。在麻株纤维发育达到成熟阶段后，如不及时收获，就会使茎秆水分缺少，麻皮巴骨，不仅造成剥麻困难，还要减低本季麻的纤维产量；同时也会影响下季麻的生长。当大部分麻株茎色由绿变黄褐色呈现至中部时，就表示纤维已成熟。这时需要组织劳力突击麻收四快工作：快打麻，快砍骨、快锄草、快追肥。争取做到麻剥到那里，麻骨就砍到那里，锄草和追肥也就赶到那里。这样才有利于二麻收获，也尽快给三麻生长准备了良好的发育条件。
    ②追肥防旱。三麻生长的特点是前期伸长很快，需要充足的养分和水分，因此在二麻收获后，应立即追施大量肥料。生长二、三周后，麻株开始着蕾，消耗养分多，所以着蕾前也应追一次肥，以增加麻株营养生长所需养分。四、五周后，麻株伸长减慢，进入纤维成熟发育阶段，此时仍须追肥一次，以促使麻皮加厚。根据苎麻根系特别发达，吸肥力强的特点，追肥应先多后少，使之充分发挥肥效。三麻的追肥施用量，第一次每亩施硫铵二十至三十斤（或人粪尿十五至二十担），腐熟饼肥一百至一百五十斤，猪牛粪二十至三十担及草木灰二百至三百斤。第二次每亩施硫铵十至十五斤和硫酸钾十斤。第三次每亩施硫铵及硫酸钾各十斤。三麻生长期内，如遇天旱，必须结合追肥进行灌溉、复草和中耕等防旱措施。
    ③防虫防风。为害三季苎麻的主要虫害，为夜蛾、黄夹蝶及赤夹蝶。初孵化出的夜蛾及黄夹蝶幼虫，还未分散前，用6％可湿性666一斤兑水二百斤喷杀，效果很好；到幼虫已分散或已长老时，抗药力增强，改用九千到万分之一的1605喷杀。赤夹蛾幼虫在开始包叶或已包叶时，应用九千到万分之一的1605喷杀。苎麻植株因伸长迅速，茎秆嫩弱，遇有五、六级以上大风时，不是擦伤麻叶麻茎，影响苎麻生长，降低纤维品质，就是麻秆被吹断，或成片形成倒伏，造成严重减产。所以防风是保证苎麻获得丰产的重要措施之一。
    掌握大麻沤制技术
    大麻收获过早，纤维未发育成熟，产量低；收获过迟，不仅纤维粗硬，品质差，同时由于雄麻干枯死亡，既增加沤洗上的困难，也要减低产量。适宜收获期是在雄麻开花盛期。收获时应根据人力及麻地大小，确定收获面积，做到当天收当天沤，收多少就沤多少，不使麻秆曝晒，曝晒变黄的麻秆沤出来的麻，色泽差，品质不好。收获时有用手拔起然后砍根的，也有用镰刀齐地面割的，不论用那一种方法，麻根不宜留得过长，以免减少产量。收获后打去麻叶，然后按麻株大小分级，并打成直径五寸左右的麻捆沤制。大麻是沤洗技术最强的纤维作物，沤麻要用清水。压麻要用石块、木棒或沙砾，否则有损纤维品质。沤麻所需时间，随各地沤麻时的水温高低而不同。麻秆入水后，各地应根据水温条件随时进行检查，发现水液呈粘状，麻秆上附有粘液，全株布满小气泡时，就是沤好的特征，这时必须尽快取出冲洗晒麻。
    提高?麻纤维品质
    ?麻的适时收获期是大部分麻株长有五个以上绿色蒴果的时候，不能收获过晚，否则容易形成铁根焦梢麻，降低纤维品质。?麻根部皮层，经沤制后其纤维与地上部分的一样柔和好用。所以?麻收获时应连根拔起，带根沤制。麻株收获后须晒一至两天，然后打捆沤麻，这样麻株易于成熟一致，同时也易除去麻叶及根上泥土，便于沤制。沤麻时麻捆不宜堆积过厚，深水不要超过五尺，浅水不要超过三尺。麻捆以压入水内五寸左右为宜。麻沤以后，要经常检查，看到麻株表皮发黄，韧皮与木质部容易分开，表皮一洗就掉，纤维呈白色网状，就算沤制成熟，就可以剥麻。
