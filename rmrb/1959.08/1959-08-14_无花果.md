    △Although people cannot see the flowers of the fig, they receive its benefits; although nameless heroes are nameless, their hard work will be forever remembered by the people.
    △The ocean can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it. A good sailor "watches the wind and changes the rudder", and can move forward even against the current; the ocean of the masses can support good people and punish bad people; good workers "follow the will of the people" -- take the mass line, and can successfully complete tasks even in the face of difficulties.
    △The roc soars into the sky, spreading its wings for thousands of miles; the earthworm burrows into the ground, loosening the hard earth; people should have the roc's "soaring drive" and the earthworm's "burrowing spirit," able to travel a thousand miles in a day and be down-to-earth.

    △人们虽然看不到无花果的花，但却得到它的实惠；无名英雄虽无名，他们的辛劳，人民将永远记忆。
    △海洋能载舟，也能复舟，善驶者“看风转舵”，虽逆流而能前进；群众的海洋，能拥戴好人，也能惩治坏人；好的工作者“顺乎人心”——走群众路线，虽有困难，也能胜利完成任务。
    △大鹏冲空而去，展翅千里；蚯蚓钻入地下，把硬地翻松；人应该有大鹏的“冲天干劲”，又有蚯蚓的“入地钻劲”，既能一日千里，又能扎扎实实。
