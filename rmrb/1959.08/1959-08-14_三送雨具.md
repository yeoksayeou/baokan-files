　　Three Deliveries of Rain Gear
    The business hours were about to begin, and the girls were busily organizing merchandise and cleaning the store to welcome customers.

    But the weather was uncooperative, and it suddenly started raining heavily. The sparse number of customers made the No. 2 General Merchandise Department of the Dongguang Central Store in Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, somewhat deserted, and the girls were a bit disappointed.

    "Sister Xiuzhen, at eleven o'clock, there will be two passenger trains, one from Tianjin to Shijiazhuang and the other from Dezhou to Tianjin, stopping at Dongguang Station!" The young female salesperson, Xiao Ma, suddenly remembered this and said it. The two girls discussed it for a while and consulted their leader about their plan. Soon, they selected a large pile of rain boots and umbrellas from the cabinets, carried them on their backs, and headed straight for the station, which was more than two *li* away from the department store. Although they brought dozens of pairs of rain boots and dozens of umbrellas, it was not enough to meet the needs of the passengers, and some of the rain boot sizes were not suitable. They had to travel back and forth between the station and the department store three times in the heavy rain. They were soaked to the bone. But when they saw the passengers taking the rain gear and avoiding the rain, they smiled with satisfaction. (Qing Tian)

　　三送雨具
    营业的时间快到了，姑娘们都在紧张地整理商品，打扫屋子，迎接顾客。
    但天不作美，忽然下起大雨来了；稀少的顾客，使河北交河县东光中心商店第二百货门市部有些冷清，姑娘们有些扫兴。
    “秀珍姐，十一点钟，有天津到石家庄、德州到天津的两次客车要在东光车站停车呵！”年轻的女营业员小马忽然想起这桩事，说了这句话。这两位姑娘商量了一阵并把她俩的心事请示了领导。不久，她俩从柜橱里挑选出一大堆雨鞋雨伞，背起就走，一直奔向离门市部二里多远的车站。她们虽然带了几十双雨鞋、几十把雨伞，但是不能满足旅客的需要，而且有的雨鞋号头不合适，她们就不得不在大雨中往返车站和门市部三次。她俩浑身都淋湿了。但当看到旅客拿上雨具不受雨淋时，都满意地笑了。（青　天）
