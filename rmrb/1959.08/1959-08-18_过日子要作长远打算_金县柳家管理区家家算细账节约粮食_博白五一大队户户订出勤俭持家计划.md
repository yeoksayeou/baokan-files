　　Plan for the Long Term
　　Jin County's Liu Family Management Area Calculates Meticulously and Saves Grain in Every Household
　　Bobai's "May First" Brigade Orders Frugal Household Plans for Every Family

　　This newspaper reports that the Party branch of the Liu Family Management Area in the Xingshutun Commune of Jin County, Liaoning Province, is good at leading commune members in living frugally. In the summer and autumn, they pay attention to increasing production and saving in many ways, preparing grain and other "expenses" for the winter and spring, so that everyone lives a relatively wealthy life year-round. 80% of the households in the area have savings in the commune credit cooperative, with an average savings of forty-seven yuan per household.

　　The Party branch in this area attaches great importance to helping commune members plan their lives from a long-term perspective. Last autumn, when grain came onto the market, the Party branch promoted the principle that "it's good to save at the top of the pile, but difficult to save at the bottom" and helped commune members find ways to save grain for the winter and spring seasons. Gao Jinzhi, a branch committee member and director of the management area's women's affairs, led women in discussions on how to eat well, save money, and eat healthily. They came up with many good ideas, such as collecting more seaweed, making more vegetable soup, eating a mixture of dry and liquid foods, eating more dry foods when busy and more liquid foods when idle, steaming more vegetable buns, and eating more vegetable pancakes. At the beginning of this year, the Party branch called on commune members to grow more vegetables, mobilize them to interplant potatoes in cornfields, and plant small white cabbage in potato fields. When commune members lacked seeds for planting potatoes in their small plots, the management area helped them solve the difficulty of providing over 1,000 catties of seeds. The people here say that this is the real "way to live."

　　In terms of living frugally, the branch's cadres have set an example. This year, the management area has more than 50,000 catties of sweet potato "mothers" (i.e., sweet potatoes after growing seedlings). In the past, because they couldn't find a good way to eat them, half of the sweet potato "mothers" were often wasted. How could they be made tasty? Comrade Ma Jikuan, the Party branch secretary, pondered for many days and first experimented with a good method in his own home: cutting the sweet potato "mothers" into slices and steaming them, or cutting them into shreds and mixing them with flour to make pancakes. This method was very popular with the masses, both adjusting their diet and saving grain.

　　The Party branch in this management area pays special attention to helping those commune members who are not very good at managing their lives. Zhang Meirong's family has six people, and they don't pay much attention to saving grain. The children run around the streets eating pancakes all day, so they are living a little tightly. Gao Jinzhi, a member of the Party branch committee and director of women's affairs, helped Zhang Meirong calculate the details and study how to eat more vegetables and how to teach the children to not eat dry food as snacks. Through detailed calculations and arrangements, Zhang Meirong found some ways to manage her household.

　　Through all possible means of saving, 90% of the commune members in the area have achieved self-sufficiency in grain or have a surplus, and there is no "winter-spring famine." In an area with many cash crops and many people engaged in industrial labor, achieving such a high rate of grain self-sufficiency is a great achievement.

　　The housewives in this management area not only pay attention to saving, but also actively participate in labor. Without affecting the production of the commune, they also vigorously develop household sideline production, increasing actual income in many ways. All the families in the management area have 51 households raising 54 pigs and 315 chickens, and they also raise many rabbits, ducks, geese, sheep, etc. Yang Jinyu's family of five raised one big pig, sixteen chickens, and nine rabbits this year. The two laborers in the family never delay a single workday, and they take time out in the morning and evening to raise poultry. Because the people here always pay attention to thrift, they have developed a good habit of saving over the years. Now, 80% of the commune members have deposits in the commune credit cooperative, with an average savings of 47 yuan per household.

　　This newspaper reports that the "May First" Brigade of the Longtan Commune in Bobai County, Guangxi, is implementing the spirit of increasing production and saving, and every household is making plans for thrift and frugality. Of the 943 households in the brigade, 816 have already made household plans, of which 83.9% are households with surplus grain, totaling 20,089 catties of surplus grain; 99.3% of the households that have made plans have surplus money, with savings of over 99,000 yuan. They also plan to raise an average of 2.8 pigs per household and 6 poultry per person by the end of the year.

　　This brigade is a well-known example of thrift and frugality in the Yulin Special District. In the past, many models of thrift and frugality have emerged. Under their influence and promotion, the brigade launched a vigorous savings movement in May this year. According to statistics at the end of June, 767 households had private savings, totaling more than 33,000 yuan. Part of this was lent to the production team to buy fertilizer, which strongly promoted the development of agricultural production. The brigade had a good harvest in the first half of this year, with a generally good early rice harvest. After the harvest, the brigade took out 12,000 yuan in cash and 5,000 catties of rice to repay the commune members' past savings loans. This further encouraged the commune members' enthusiasm for increasing production and saving.

　　Recently, the Party branch of the "May First" Brigade, in conjunction with the formulation of the summer harvest distribution plan, continued to lead commune members in carrying out the movement to increase production and save, helping each household to formulate plans for thrift and frugality. The plan includes several aspects such as each household's work attendance, income, expenditure, and grain consumption. It requires that medium and high labor forces work 28 labor days per month for men and no less than 23 labor days for women; give full play to the role of semi-labor forces, use the scattered land in front of and behind the houses to plant melons and beans, raise more livestock and poultry, and households with conditions can do some family handicraft production. At the same time, carefully calculate and plan grain consumption and tighten expenses. The various fruits harvested from each family's fruit trees should also be supplied to the city as much as possible. After the plans were made, each family then held a family discussion meeting to discuss measures for implementing the plan.

　　Through the formulation of the plans, the commune members generally reflected that with such careful calculations, they would not have to worry about not having surplus money and grain in the future. The summer harvest in this brigade ended as early as the beginning of July, but until mid-July, the commune members of the 29th team were still eating old grain, and they were eating a combination of staple and miscellaneous grains, reserving the distributed new grain.

　　过日子要作长远打算
　　金县柳家管理区家家算细账节约粮食
　　博白五一大队户户订出勤俭持家计划
    本报讯　辽宁省金县杏树屯公社柳家管理区党支部，善于领导社员勤俭过日子，夏秋便注意多方面增产节约，为冬春备粮和其他“用度”，大家长年生活得都比较富裕。全区80％的户数在公社信用部里有储蓄，每户平均储款四十七元。
    这个区的党支部很重视帮助社员从长远打算安排生活。去年秋天粮食一登场，党支部就向社员宣传
  “囤尖好省，囤底难省”的道理，帮助社员想法为冬春两季节约粮食。支部委员、管理区妇女主任高金枝领导妇女讨论怎样才能吃得又饱、又省、又好。她们研究出许多好办法，如多捞海菜，多熬菜汤，干的稀的互相调剂着吃，忙的时候多吃干的，闲的时候就多熬点稀的，多蒸菜包子，多夹菜饼子吃等等。今年一开春，党支部又号召社员多种菜，发动社员在苞米地里套种土豆，土豆地里套种小白菜。当社员自己在小块园地种土豆缺种子时，管理区就帮助社员解决了一千多斤种子的困难。这里的群众都说，这才是真正的“过日子之道。”
    在勤俭过日子方面支部的干部们起到了带头作用。今年这个管理区下炕的地瓜母子（即育出地瓜秧以后的地瓜）有五万多斤。往年因为没找到一个好吃法，地瓜母子常常吃一半糟蹋一半。怎么做才好吃呢？党支部书记马吉宽同志琢磨了很多日子，先在自己家里试验出一个好办法，把地瓜母子切成片蒸着吃，或是切成丝掺在面里糊饼子吃。这个办法很受群众的欢迎，既调剂了生活，又节约了粮食。
    这个管理区党支部对一些不大会过日子的社员，特别注意具体帮助。张美荣家有六口人，吃粮不大注意节约，孩子们整天拿着饼子满街跑着吃，因此日子过得有点紧。党支部委员、妇女主任高金枝帮助张美荣算了细账，研究怎样多吃菜，怎样叫小孩养成不零吃干粮的习惯。通过细算细安排，张美荣找到了一些治理家务的门路。
    经过千方百计地节约，全区90％的社员粮食作到了自足或有余，没有“冬春荒”。在这一带经济作物较多、从事工业劳动的人较多的情况下，能达到这样高的粮食自给率，是一个很大的成就。
    这个管理区的家庭妇女，不仅注意节约，而且积极参加劳动，在不影响社里生产的情况下，还大力发展家庭副业生产，从多方面增加实际收入。全管理区有五十一户社员共养活五十四头猪，三百一十五只鸡，还饲养了很多兔、鸭、鹅、羊等。杨金玉全家五口人，今年养活一头大猪，十六只鸡、九只兔。家里两个劳动力，从来不肯耽误一个工，早晚抽空饲弄家禽。这里的人们由于时时注意勤俭，几年来也养成了节约储蓄的好习惯。现在80％的社员在公社信用部有存款，平均每户储蓄四十七元。

    本报讯　广西博白县龙潭公社“五一”大队贯彻增产节约精神，户户订出勤俭持家计划。全队九百四十三户，已订好家庭计划有八百十六户，其中节约余粮户占订计划户的83.9％，共有余粮二万零八十九斤；有余款户占已订计划户的99.3％，可储蓄九万九千多元。还计划私人养猪到年底平均每户二点八头，家禽每人六只。
    这个大队是玉林专区有名的勤俭持家的榜样。过去曾涌现出许多勤俭持家的模范。在他们的影响和推动下，今年5月全队又大力开展了节约储蓄运动。到6月底统计，私人存款七百六十七户，共存余款三万三千多元。其中一部分借给生产队买肥料，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。今年上半年这个队收成很好，早稻普遍丰收。丰收后，大队拿出一万二千元现金和五千斤稻谷还给社员过去的节约贷款。这就更鼓舞了社员增产节约的积极性。
    最近，“五一”大队党支部结合制订夏收分配方案，继续领导社员开展增产节约运动，帮助各户制订勤俭持家计划。计划包括每户出工、收入、支出、用粮等几个方面。要求中上劳动力每月出工男二十八个劳动日，妇女不少于二十三个劳动日；充分发挥半劳动力的作用，利用屋前屋后的零星土地种植瓜、豆，多饲养家畜家禽，有条件的户可做些家庭手工业生产。同时精打细算，计划用粮，紧缩开支。各家的果树收下的各种水果，也尽量供应城市。计划订好后，各家接着召开了家庭座谈会，讨论执行计划的措施。
    通过订计划，社员普遍反映，这样精打细算，不愁今后没有余钱余粮。这个大队夏收早在7月上旬就结束了，可是直到7月中旬，二十九队的各户社员仍吃着陈粮，并且主杂粮搭配着吃，把分到的新粮储备起来。　（刘远修）
