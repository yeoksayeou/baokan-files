Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th -- In order to meet the needs of the booming industrial sectors for new technical workers, the Soviet Union will vigorously train employees who can master the new technologies of automation and mechanization. During the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965), various vocational and technical schools in the Soviet Union will train 14.8 million new workers who can adapt to the requirements of current scientific and technological development.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government pay close attention to the work of cultivating skilled labor reserves. In order to improve the training and education of new workers, the Soviet Union recently reorganized the Central Labor Reserve Administration into the State Vocational and Technical Education Committee of the Council of Ministers.

Starting this year, the Soviet Union will gradually establish many new types of vocational and technical schools. It is estimated that a total of about 5,000 such schools will be established in seven years, each with a capacity of 400 students. In addition, the Soviet Union will also reorganize the existing schools belonging to the labor reserve system.

In recent years, due to the rapid development of national economic construction, the number of employees in the Soviet Union has increased significantly. In addition, due to the development of automation and mechanization, the proportion of workers in various types of work required in industrial enterprises is also changing. Those working in automated enterprises are mainly adjustment workers, instrument workers, electrical and repair fitters. This urgently requires improving the technical level of workers. During the seven years, the Soviet Union will mainly train workers in electrification and mechanization in agricultural production. By 1965, agricultural vocational and technical schools will train 500,000 skilled workers annually.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th -- Party organizations at all levels in the Soviet Union are preparing for the 1959-1960 academic year of Party education. The preparations for the new academic year are being carried out on the basis of summarizing the experience of last year's political education.

According to a recent report in "Pravda," the basic content of political education in the new academic year is: to deeply study the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and the theoretical issues and practical tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the previous plenary sessions of the Central Committee. In the new academic year, different forms of study will be adopted according to the different conditions of the students: political schools, economic schools, Marxist-Leninist universities, as well as study groups and seminars on the history of the Party, philosophy, political economy, and the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In addition, there will also be study groups and seminars on current affairs and policies, the international situation, the socialist construction of people's democratic countries, and the world communist movement.

In terms of learning methods, self-study will be the main focus, combined with collective discussions.

Many non-Party masses, especially members of the Communist Youth League, activists, advanced workers, and representatives of intellectuals, will be widely absorbed into political schools, study groups, and Marxist-Leninist night schools for study.

The newspaper said that in the new academic year, in order to further improve the content of political education and raise its ideological level and educational role, political study will be closely linked to the actual situation and the specific tasks of communist construction, so that political education is combined with improving the awareness and labor enthusiasm of the Soviet people. Political education will instill communist ideas into the working people through certain specific forms. All political education work will promote the improvement of people's moral character in their attitude towards labor, cultivate the working people's ability to manage society themselves, and educate them in the spirit of collectivism, love of labor, socialist internationalism and patriotism, and high communist morality.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th -- Among the new students enrolled in Soviet universities this year, about 80% will come from production posts; while last year it was about 70%.

Of the 180,000 university students enrolled in the Russian Federal Republic, more than 144,000 are staff members from industrial and mining enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and other work posts.

Various factories and farms actively recommend and introduce young people with excellent performance in labor and work to continue their studies. The Moscow Machine Tool Institute received about 2,000 application forms, of which more than 1,000 were submitted by young production workers.

State farms and collective farms also recommended outstanding workers and farmers to study at universities or specialized schools. The "Lenin's Road" collective farm in Kalinin Oblast recommended Viselikova, an excellent milkmaid, to study at the Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. Viselikova is the daughter of a martyr in the Patriotic War. After graduating from middle school, she worked on the farm for three years and now has the opportunity to further her studies.

All candidates from production posts have priority to be admitted.

    适应七年计划科学技术发展的要求
    苏联兴办多种技术学校培养新工人
    各级党组织正准备党的教育新学年加强政治理论教育
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　为满足蓬勃发展的工业各部门对新技术工人的需要，苏联将大力培养能掌握自动化、机械化的新技术的职工。在七年计划（1959—1965年）期间，苏联各种职业技术学校将培养出一千四百八十万能适应当前科学技术发展要求的新工人。
    苏联共产党和政府十分注意培养熟练的劳动后备力量的工作。为改进对新工人的培养和教育，苏联最近已将中央劳动后备管理局改组成部长会议国家职业技术教育委员会。
    从今年起，苏联将陆续创办许多新式的职业技术学校。预计七年中总共将建立约五千所这种学校，每所能容纳四百名学生。此外，苏联还要改组现有的属于劳动后备系统的各种学校。
    近年来由于国民经济建设的迅速发展，苏联职工人数有了很大的增长。此外，由于自动化、机械化的发展，工业企业中所需要的各工种的工人的比重也在改变。在自动化的企业中工作的，主要是调整工人、仪表工人、电气和修理钳工。这就急需提高工人技术水平。在七年间，苏联在农业生产方面将主要培养电气化、机械化方面的工人。到1965年，农业职业技术学校每年将培养出五十万名熟练的工人。
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联各级党组织正在准备1959—1960年度党的教育新学年。新学年的准备工作是在总结去年政治教育经验的基础上进行的。
    据“真理报”最近报道，新学年政治教育的基本内容是：深入学习马克思列宁主义经典著作、“苏共党史”、苏共二十一大和历届中央全会所提出的理论问题和实际任务。在新学年中，将根据学员不同的条件采取各种不同的学习形式：政治学校、经济学校、马克思列宁主义大学，以及党史、哲学、政治经济学、马克思列宁主义基础学习小组和讨论会。此外，还将有时事政策、国际形势、人民民主国家社会主义建设和世界共产主义运动学习小组和讨论会等。
    在学习方法上，将以自学为主，并结合集体讨论。
    许多非党群众，特别是共青团员、积极分子、先进工作者和知识分子的代表将被广泛吸收到政治学校、学习小组和马克思列宁主义夜校中学习。
    报纸说，在新的学年中，为了进一步改善政治教育的内容和提高它的思想水平及教育作用，政治学习将密切联系实际和共产主义建设的具体任务，使政治教育同提高苏联人民的觉悟和劳动热情结合起来。政治教育将把共产主义思想通过一定的具体形式灌输给劳动人民。全部政治教育工作将促进人们对待劳动的道德风貌的提高，培养劳动人民善于自己管理社会，而且要以集体主义、爱好劳动、社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义，以及高度的共产主义道德的精神来进行教育。
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联今年招收的高等学校的新生中，来自生产岗位的约将占80％；而在去年约占70％左右。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国招收的十八万名大学生中，约有十四万四千多人是来自工矿企业、集体农庄、国营农场和其他工作岗位上的工作人员。
    各个工厂、农庄都积极推荐和介绍在劳动中、工作中成绩优异的青年继续深造。莫斯科车床工具学院收到了约两千份报考申请书，其中有一千多份是青年生产工作者递送的。
    国营农场和集体农庄也纷纷推荐优秀的工人和庄员去大学或专科学校学习。加里宁州“列宁之路”集体农庄推荐了优秀的挤奶员维谢利科娃去莫斯科季米里雅泽夫农学院学习。维谢利科娃是卫国战争时一位烈士的女儿，中学毕业后，在农庄劳动了三年，现在又得到了深造的机会。
    所有来自生产岗位的考生，都有被录取的优先权。
