Model Party Member Shen Changlin

    In a mountain village near the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an – Majiagou – there is a white-haired, beloved elder. He is the model Party member Shen Changlin. Since joining the Party twenty-four years ago, he has been loyal and diligent, dedicating all his energy to the glorious cause of communism. He has been elected as a people's representative several times. He is currently a member of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the CPC, a member of the Standing Committee of the蟠龙 (Panlong) People's Commune Party Committee, and the Secretary of the Party Branch of the Majiagou Production Team.

    Shen Changlin is already sixty-five years old, but his labor enthusiasm is very high. He is the first to get up every morning. After getting up, he calls the production team leader to blow the whistle and let the commune members go to the fields to produce. By the time the commune members start production, he has already hoed two "longs" (垅, a measure of land).

    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Shen Changlin's enthusiasm has been even greater. Whether building terraced fields, planting trees, or building dams, he works as hard as a young man. He earns as many work points in a year as a young man, but he still maintains a hardworking and simple lifestyle. He has been wearing the same single layer of clothing for five years, patching it up when needed. He still uses a sheep bone cigarette holder. He also keeps a close watch on the team's expenses. He will ask about it if they leave a light on too long or use too much paper.

### 模范党员申长林

    模范党员申长林
    在革命圣地延安附近的一个山村——马家沟，有一位白发银鬓，受人爱戴的老者。他就是模范党员申长林。他入党二十四年来，一直忠心耿耿、勤勤恳恳，把全部精力贡献给光辉的共产主义事业。他曾经几次当选为人民代表。现在担任着中共延安地委委员、蟠龙人民公社党委会的常委、马家沟生产队的支部书记。
    申长林已经六十五岁了，可是，现在，他的劳动热情很高。每天早晨第一个起床，起床以后，就叫生产队长吹哨子，让社员下地生产，等到社员开始生产的时候，他已经锄了二垅地了。
    去年大跃进以来，申长林的劲头更大了，无论修梯田、造林和修拦河坝，他都和年轻小伙子一样干。他一年所得工分和一个年轻人一样多，但是，他仍然保持着艰苦朴素的作风，一件单衣修修补补穿了五年。他直到现在还是用羊骨头烟管。他对队里的开支抓得也紧，多点一个灯，多用几张纸，他都要过问。
