The Suffering and Struggle of Haiti
By our reporter Yuan Mu, Yu Minsheng

    Shortly after the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the US government hastily allocated six million US dollars to "aid" the Haitian government, and decided to send more Marines to Haiti to help train the army, attempting to maintain the crumbling reactionary dictatorial rule in Haiti. At the same time, some Western news agencies also lamented in their reports that the Haitian dictatorship was facing the eve of "collapse", the political situation in Haiti was "on the verge of exploding", and Haiti had become another "most dangerous" country in Latin America after Cuba.
    What is the current situation of this black country in Latin America with a population of more than three million? Alexis, a Haitian black progressive writer who came to China from the Caribbean coast, recently told reporters about the suffering and struggle of the Haitian people today.
    "The US imperialist's brutal plunder of Haiti has paralyzed the entire Haitian economy." Speaking of the suffering of Haiti, Alexis first accused the United States of its crimes of aggression against Haiti. He said: "Now, US imperialism not only fully controls the politics, military and diplomacy of the Haitian government, equips the Haitian reactionary army with weapons, and sends American officers to train the Haitian army, but also more and more American capital is infiltrating Haiti, exploiting the Haitian people."
    At present, US capital has controlled all the major industrial enterprises and the lifeblood of the national economy in Haiti, such as railways, shipyards, sugar factories, and warehouses. It also controls the vast majority of Haiti's rich mineral deposits and 90% of agricultural products such as sugarcane and coffee. 92% of Haiti's annual exports are shipped to the United States, and 87% of Haiti's required industrial products and daily necessities come from the United States. In just over a year since 1958, the United States, through the Haitian government which sells out national interests, has robbed nearly a hundred mining rights in Haiti almost without any cost. One American company recently seized a large mining area from Haiti that could exploit important minerals such as copper and aluminum, and the price they paid was only one US dollar per hectare per year. Some wealthy people in the southern United States recently stuffed tens of thousands of dollars into the private pockets of the Haitian government economic officials in charge, and as a result, they controlled the entire milling industry in Haiti. The US government now not only has an economic advisory group in Haiti to directly control the Haitian economy and serve the interests of US capital, but the Haitian government also has to provide the "advisory group" with 350,000 US dollars each year as "remuneration" for them.
    "US monopoly capital in Haiti has reached the point of 'getting whatever it wants', and the Haitian reactionary ruling group is unscrupulous and very despicable in selling out national interests." Speaking of this, Alexis told us a scandal that was widely circulated in Haiti not long ago.
    At the end of 1958, an American businessman named Biyou Cholin came to Haiti, and the Haitian government wanted to sell him the mining rights of a mining area. Biyou Cholin openly blackmailed and said, if you want to sell, I can consider it, but you must first give me 350,000 US dollars as a "consideration fee" for this matter. The Haitian reactionary rulers, who were determined to please American capitalists and profit from it, actually agreed to Biyou Cholin's request. Andre Teal, the current Minister of Finance and Commerce of the Duvalier government, personally wrote a check for 350,000 US dollars to Biyou Cholin. Some congressmen learned about this matter, and because they did not get a share of the spoils, they made a big noise in the parliament, accusing the government of openly bribing, destroying the law, and demanding that Biyou Cholin be arrested immediately and the case be thoroughly investigated. At this time, Biyou Cholin had returned to New York. He openly declared in New York that he was not a "thief", and that the Haitian Minister of Finance and Commerce willingly gave him the money. He also said that he only got 100,000 US dollars, and the other 250,000 US dollars were divided by the Haitian President and the Minister of Finance and Commerce. When Teal, the Haitian Minister of Finance and Commerce, heard the news, he rushed to New York and repeatedly begged Biyou Cholin not to expose the truth of the matter. In order to protect himself, Duvalier arrested Teal's wife and children while Teal went to New York, and wrote a letter to Teal, asking him to return to Haiti immediately to stand trial. After receiving the letter, Teal was furious and immediately wrote back to Duvalier, saying that he had kept all the files of Duvalier and him conspiring together, and threatened that if the president insisted on trying him, he would publish these materials to the international press without reservation. Seeing that the situation was not good, Duvalier immediately released Teal's wife and children, and invited the congressmen to dinner, gave them gifts, and said that he was in a difficult situation in this case, and repeatedly pleaded for an extension of the processing time. In this way, this case was delayed.
    "There is no end to similar scandals," Alexis said. He then cited many examples, deeply exposing the Haitian reactionary ruling group's bloody oppression of the people, corruption, and bribery while relying on US imperialism externally, and the domestic politics had become extremely corrupt.
    Not long ago, the farmers in the Berlin River Basin in Haiti accused the former Minister of Agriculture of stealing tens of thousands of hectares of land from the banks of this river. The current Minister of Agriculture organized a committee to investigate this case, but he not only failed to seriously investigate the crimes of the former Minister of Agriculture, but also used his power to drive a large number of farmers away from their own land and steal tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land. The son of this Minister of Agriculture serves as the director of the so-called "promoting" the agricultural development committee in the Berlin River Basin. He has not done anything beneficial to the farmers, and he has sold all the tractors, irrigation machinery, etc. of the committee and divided the spoils with his subordinates. After the Cuban revolution, the Haitian ambassador to Cuba not only openly sheltered Batista elements in the embassy, ​​but also charged 10,000 US dollars per person, and also charged 20 US dollars per day for food and accommodation, and all this money filled the ambassador's private pocket. At the beginning of this year, a famine occurred in northwestern Haiti. Many victims were displaced because they did not receive relief, and there were corpses everywhere. The Duvalier government publicly issued a statement requesting all Americans who travel to Haiti's scenic spots to bring a bag of flour, a bag of green beans, and a bottle of wine to Haiti per person. Alexis sarcastically said: "Those Americans naturally did not bother to pay attention to the corrupt and incompetent Haitian government. They still traveled to Haiti's famous tourist areas, but brought nothing."
    The brutal plunder of US imperialism and the corrupt rule of the reactionary government have brought the Haitian people into the abyss of unemployment and death. The poverty of the Haitian people has reached a terrible level. In Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti with a population of 400,000, the number of unemployed people has reached more than 200,000. On the day Alexis set off for China, he also witnessed a tragedy: a mother took her three children, aged one, three, and five, and ran towards a speeding car. The four of them were killed under the car, ending their poor lives! The largest textile factory in Haiti - the Port-au-Prince Textile Factory has had to stop work for several months because it has no money to pay the workers' wages. The salaries of state civil servants have been reduced again and again, and even the salaries of the army and police have begun to decrease. In 1958, state civil servants in the provinces did not receive salaries for several months, and primary school teachers did not receive any salary for nine consecutive months.
    Port-au-Prince was originally a beautiful city surrounded by mountains and rivers, but now it has become an extremely dilapidated and dirty city. Because the government has no money to engage in municipal construction, there are potholes everywhere on the road, and in some places vehicles can hardly pass. The underground water source is blocked, and the bridges have not been repaired for a long time. When it rains, the city is flooded, the bridges are washed away, and the entire city is paralyzed. After summer, mosquitoes and flies breed everywhere in the city, and diseases are prevalent. …
    "Since the capital is like this, the situation in the provinces will of course only be worse!" Alexis said slowly in a low voice.
    Even more miserable are the lives of Haitian workers and farmers. US imperialists have exploited Haiti's large amount of cheap labor to seize huge profits. In Haiti, the highest monthly income of a skilled worker is less than 30 US dollars, only seven or eight jiao per day, while in Haiti, it costs four or five US dollars for one person to eat a meal in an ordinary restaurant. US monopoly capitalists and Haitian feudal landlords occupy fertile land and the fruits of the farmers' labor. The vast majority of farmers, who account for more than 90% of the Haitian population, have no land. They work like cattle and horses for US capitalists and Haitian feudal landlords, and the total income of a farmer in a year averages only 25 yuan, only two yuan and change per month. They eat wild vegetables and tree roots all year round. Alexis told us that in the spring of this year, thousands of farmers died of starvation in northwestern Haiti alone. Countless farmers, in order to get rid of the pain, abandoned their homes and flowed into the cities, becoming beggars.
    Under the dumping of American commodities, Haiti's national industry is becoming increasingly depressed and declining. Factories are closing down or dismissing employees, and the income of commercial capitalists is not enough to pay the salaries of employees. The education cause is backward to an alarming extent. 90% of the people in Haiti are illiterate. In Haiti, no writer can rely solely on writing to maintain their livelihood. Alexis is one of the famous writers in Haiti. He has authored many novels and scripts such as "Sun Lord", "Gao Le Tree", "A Moment", "Eyes of Roses" and "Dollar". The novel "Sun Lord" has been translated and published in twenty-three languages ​​in the world. Even he has no way to maintain his livelihood by writing and has to practice medicine during the day and write at night.
    "Haiti was a very wealthy country in the late 18th century, and its total exports at that time were more than double the total exports of France. But why has it become so poor now? The living reality enables everyone in Haiti to answer this question." Alexis affirmed: "The Haitian people will not tolerate such brutal plunder by US monopoly capital and the dictatorial rulers' kowtowing and selling out of national interests for a long time."
    Now, on the land of this only "black republic" in Latin America, sparks have spread everywhere. Haitian workers working in US-controlled enterprises are constantly holding strikes to resist the brutal oppression of US monopoly capital. Although armed police or troops appear in front of the workers whenever they strike, the strikes continue. The farmers in northern Haiti once drove away the feudal landlords and occupied all the land. Although they were later suppressed by the army, incidents of peasant resistance still occur. The farmers in the south spontaneously organized themselves for military training, and they practiced with wooden guns. Incidents of opposing the dictatorial rule occur frequently in rural and urban areas, and even government planes are intercepted by people who oppose the government on the way.
    Faced with this situation, the dictatorial rulers are intensifying their suppression of the people, and are increasingly showing their weakness. In Port-au-Prince, the government hired three or four thousand secret police with high salaries to carry out special agent rule over the people. Every night, these secret police break into residents' homes to conduct inspections and arrests. Thousands of industrialists, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life in Port-au-Prince have hidden themselves and are living a wandering life.
    The dictatorial rulers do not even dare to trust their own army, and the Haitian military department has undergone several purges. Guard posts are set up on the main roads entering Port-au-Prince. When cars pass through the guard posts, they have to stop to check the people in the car, in order to prevent opponents from attacking the government. Now, the presidential palace and the government headquarters have been designated as military zones, surrounded by tanks, artillery and machine guns, as if the doomsday of the dictatorial rulers is coming.
    All of this that Mr. Alexis told us is a true portrayal of the Haitian political situation that makes the imperialists tremble with fear! (Attached picture)

    海地的苦难和斗争
    本报记者　袁木　于民生
    在古巴革命取得胜利以后不久，美国政府就匆忙地拨款六百万美元“援助”海地政府，并且决定进一步派遣海军陆战队到海地帮助训练军队，企图以此来维系摇摇欲坠的海地反动独裁统治。就在这个时候，一些西方通讯社在他们的报道中也发出哀鸣，认为海地的独裁统治已面临“崩溃”前夕，海地政局大有“一触即发”之势，海地在拉丁美洲已成为继古巴之后另一个“最危险”的国家。
    这个拉丁美洲有三百多万人口的黑人国家的近况究竟怎样？从加勒比海之滨来我国访问的海地朋友——海地黑人进步作家阿列克西斯，最近向记者诉说了今日海地人民的苦难和斗争。
    “美帝国主义对海地的残酷掠夺，已经使海地的整个经济限于瘫痪状态。”谈到海地的苦难，阿列克西斯首先就控诉了美国对海地的侵略罪行。他说：“现在，美帝国主义不仅全面地控制着海地政府的政治、军事和外交，用武器装备海地反动军队，派遣美国军官训练海地军队，并且有越来越多的美国资本渗入海地，剥削海地人民。”
    目前美国资本已经控制了海地的所有铁路、造船厂、糖厂、仓库等主要工业企业和国家经济命脉，控制了海地的绝大部分丰富矿藏和90％的甘蔗、咖啡等农业品。海地每年的输出品有92％是运往美国，而海地所需用的工业品和日用品，有87％是来自美国。仅仅从1958年以来的短短一年多时间里，美国就通过出卖民族利益的海地政府，几乎毫无代价地从海地劫去近百处矿藏的开采权。有一个美国公司，最近从海地夺走了一个可以开采铜、铝等重要矿产的大矿区，而他们付出的代价仅仅是每一公顷土地一年一块美元。美国南部地区的一些富翁，最近只给海地政府经济部门负责官员的私人腰包里塞了几万美元，结果就控制了海地的全部磨房工业。美国政府现在不仅派有经济顾问团在海地，直接控制海地经济，为美国资本的利益服务，并且海地政府每年还要供给“顾问团”三十五万美元，作为对他们的“酬劳”。
    “美国垄断资本在海地已经到了‘要什么有什么’的为所欲为的地步，而海地反动统治集团在出卖民族利益的时候已不顾一切，十分卑鄙无耻”。谈到这里，阿列克西斯向我们叙述了不久前在海地哄传一时的一桩丑闻。
    1958年底，一个叫做比尤乔林的美国商人到了海地，海地政府要把一处矿区的开采权出卖给他。比尤乔林公然进行敲诈说，你们要卖，我可以考虑，但是要先给我三十五万美元，作为这件事情的“考虑费”。一心要讨好美国资本家并且从中渔利的海地反动统治者，居然答应了比尤乔林的要求。现任杜瓦利埃政府的财政和工商业部长安德烈·特阿尔，亲笔给比尤乔林开了一张三十五万美元的支票。一些议员们知道了这件事情，他们因为没有分到赃，就在议会中大闹起来，指责政府公然行贿，破坏法律，要求立即把比尤乔林逮捕起来，彻底追究这个案件。这时，比尤乔林已经回到纽约，他在纽约公开声明，自己不是“窃盗”，是海地财政和工商业部长心甘情愿地把钱送给他的，他并且说他自己只拿到十万美元，另外二十五万美元是由海地总统同财政和工商业部长分掉了。海地财政和工商业部长特阿尔听到这个消息以后，急忙赶到纽约，再三央求比尤乔林不要再把事实的真相暴露出来。杜瓦利埃为了保护自己，趁特阿尔到纽约去的时候，把他的妻子和小孩都逮捕起来，并写信给特阿尔，叫他立刻回到海地听候审判。特阿尔接到信以后大发雷霆，立刻写回信告诉杜瓦利埃，说是杜瓦利埃同他共同作弊的全部档案他都保存在手里，并且威胁说，如果总统坚持要审判他，他就要把这些材料毫无保留地向国际新闻界公布。杜瓦利埃见势不妙，立刻把特阿尔的妻子和小孩释放出来，并且把议员们请来吃饭，给他们送礼，说他在这个案件中处境困难，再三恳求宽限处理。这样，这桩公案才算拖延了过去。
    “类似这样的丑闻是说不完的”，阿列克西斯说。他接着又举出许多事例，深刻地揭露了海地反动统治集团在对外投靠美帝国主义的同时，对内则血肉人民，贪污腐化，贿赂公行，国内政治已经腐败透顶。
    不久前，海地地伯林河流域的农民向现政府控告前任农业部长曾经从这条河的沿岸窃取了几万公顷的土地，现任农业部长组织了一个委员会来清查这个案件，但他不仅没有认真追究前任农业部长的罪行，反而利用自己的职权，又把大批农民从他们自己的土地上赶走，盗取了几万公顷肥沃的土地。这位农业部长的儿子担任着所谓“促进”地伯林河流域农业发展委员会的主任，他没有做过一件对农民有利的事情，还把委员会的拖拉机、灌溉机械等都全部卖掉，同他手下的人分了赃。古巴革命发生以后，海地驻古巴大使不但公开地在使馆内收留巴蒂斯塔分子，并且每一人收一万美元，每天还要交饭费和住宿费二十美元，这些钱都饱了大使的私囊。今年初，海地西北部发生灾荒，许多灾民因为得不到救济而流离失所，饿殍横野，杜瓦利埃政府居然公开发表声明，要求所有到海地风景区去旅行的美国人，每人给海地带去面粉一袋、青豆一袋和酒一瓶。阿列克西斯嘲讽地说：“那些美国人自然不去答理腐败无能的海地政府，他们照样到海地著名的游览区去旅行，但甚么东西也没带来。”
    美帝国主义残酷的掠夺、反动政府腐败的统治，把海地人民带进了失业和死亡的深渊。海地人民的贫困已经达到了一种可怕的程度。有四十万人口的海地首都太子港，失业的人数竟达二十万以上。就在阿列克西斯动身到中国来的那天，他还亲眼看到一幕惨剧：有一位母亲带着她的一岁、三岁和五岁的三个孩子，奔向飞跑着的汽车，母子四人活活撞死在汽车下面，结束了贫困的生活！海地最大的一座纺织厂——太子港纺织厂因为没有钱付给工人工资不得不连续几月停工。国家公务人员的工资一减再减，甚至连军队和警察的工资也开始降低了。在1958年，外省的国家公务人员几个月领不到工资，小学教员一连九个月领不到一点薪水。
    太子港原是一座依山傍水的美丽城市，现在变成了一个极端破烂、肮脏的城市。由于政府无钱从事市政建设，马路上到处是坑洞，有的地方车辆都难以通行。地下水源被堵塞，桥梁年久失修，一下雨，满城积水，桥被冲垮，整个城市都陷于瘫痪。入夏以后，全市到处蚊蝇孳生，疾病流行。……
      “首都既然如此，外省的情况当然只会更糟糕的了！”阿列克西斯用低沉的语调慢慢地说着。
    生活更加悲惨的是海地的工人和农民。美帝国主义者利用海地大量廉价的劳动力攫取了巨额利润。在海地，一个技术工人每月的最高收入不到三十块美元，每天只有七、八角钱，而在海地，一个人到一家普通饭店里吃一顿饭就需要四、五块美元。美国垄断资本家和海地封建地主霸占着肥沃的土地和农民的劳动果实，占海地人口90％以上的农民，绝大部分都没有土地，他们像牛马一样为美国资本家和海地封建地主劳动，而一个农民一年的总收入平均只有二十五元，一个月只有二元挂零，他们终年都以野菜、树根充饥。阿列克西斯告诉我们，今年春季仅在海地的西北部就有几千农民死于饥饿。难以数计的农民为了摆脱痛苦，他们抛弃了家园，流入城市，沦为乞丐。
    在美国商品的倾销下，海地的民族工业日益萧条、衰退，工厂纷纷倒闭或者辞退职工，商业资本家的收入，还不够支付职员的薪水。教育事业落后到惊人的程度，海地有90％的人是文盲，在海地没有一个作家能专门依靠写作来维持生活。阿列克西斯就是海地著名的作家之一，他著有“太阳老爷”、“高乐树”、“一刹间”、“玫瑰的眼睛”和“美元”等许多长篇小说和剧本，“太阳老爷”这部小说曾被世界各国用二十三种语言翻译出版。就是他，也没有办法依靠写作来维持生活，不得不白天行医，晚上从事写作。
    “海地在十八世纪末叶曾经是一个很富裕的国家，当时它的出口总值超过法国出口总值的一倍。但是为甚么现在竟变得这样一贫如洗呢？活生生的现实使海地的每一个人都能回答这个问题。”阿列克西斯肯定地指出：“对于美国垄断资本那样残酷的掠夺和独裁统治者卑躬屈膝地出卖民族利益，海地人民是不会长期容忍下去的。”
    现在，在这个拉丁美洲唯一的“黑人共和国”的国土上，已遍布星星之火。在美国控制的企业里工作的海地工人不断举行罢工，反抗美国垄断资本的残酷压迫。尽管每当工人们罢工的时候，在他们面前就出现了武装的警察或军队，但是罢工还是持续进行。海地北部的农民，曾经一度赶走了封建地主，占领了所有的土地，后来虽然被军队镇压下去了，但农民反抗的事件依然不断发生。南部的农民自动组织起来进行军事训练，他们用木枪演习。反对独裁统治的事件在农村和城市时常发生，甚至连政府的飞机飞行在半路上也被反对政府的人拦截走了。
    面对这种情况，独裁统治者更加紧对人民的镇压，愈益显出他们的虚弱。在太子港，政府用高薪雇用了三、四千名秘密警察，对人民进行特务统治。每天晚上，这些秘密警察就闯入居民家里进行清查逮捕，太子港有几千名工商业者、知识分子和其他各界人士都躲藏起来，过着流荡的生活。
    独裁统治者连自己的军队都不敢信任了，海地的军事部门已经进行了好几次清洗。进入太子港的主要道路都设有岗亭，汽车经过岗亭，要停下来对乘车的人进行检查，为的是防备有反对者去袭击政府。现在，总统府、政府所在地都被划为军事区，周围布满了坦克、大炮和机关枪，好像独裁统治者的末日就要到来似的。
    阿列克西斯先生告诉我们的这一切，不正是使帝国主义者胆战心惊的“一触即发”的海地政局的真实写照吗？（附图片）
