(Reported by our newspaper) Under the instigation of the United States, the foreign ministers of the twenty-one countries belonging to the "Organization of American States" began a meeting on the 12th in Santiago, the capital of Chile, to discuss the so-called tense situation in the Caribbean. Latin American public opinion has repeatedly pointed out that the United States planned this meeting to prepare conditions for further intervention in Cuba.

The delegations of various countries participating in the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers have arrived in the Chilean capital one after another and launched pre-meeting activities.

A secret preparatory meeting was held on the evening of the 11th. It is reported that the Cuban delegation proposed at the meeting that all meetings should be open to journalists. This proposal was supported by Venezuela, Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, and other countries. This issue will be discussed and voted on at the formal plenary meeting on the 12th.

The Cuban delegation, headed by Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa, arrived in Santiago on the 11th. At the airport, Roa told reporters that his delegation insisted on discussing the necessity of addressing economic underdevelopment at the meeting, because "this is the cause of the unrest in the Caribbean region that this meeting will discuss." Roa reiterated that his government opposes any dictatorial regime, and therefore also opposes the Trujillo dictatorship. He condemned Trujillo and the Batista elements for brewing anti-Cuban conspiracies. He said that Cuba opposes the establishment of so-called international police forces, because "this force will be used to support the few remaining dictatorial regimes in the Americas."

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ignacio Luis Arcaya said at a press conference on the same day that the Trujillo dictatorship is the source of tension in the Caribbean region. He pointed out that Venezuela and Cuba have common ground; the people of both countries have overthrown dictatorial systems and are now subject to aggression from the Trujillo regime. He accused the "Organization of American States" of protecting dictatorial regimes in the Americas.

The two agenda items arranged by the Council of the "Organization of American States" for this meeting are: (1) The tense situation in the Caribbean region; (2) The effective implementation of representative democracy and respect for human rights. It has been pointed out that these are two traps set by the United States for Cuba. The United States intends to use any of these two agenda items as an excuse to further and loudly intervene in Cuba. As everyone knows, prominent U.S. officials, from Eisenhower to Miami Senator Smathers, have all reversed black and white and described the tense situation created by the United States in the Caribbean as being caused by the new Cuban government established after overthrowing the dictatorial rule. In addition, Wall Street agents have repeatedly slandered the Cuban government as not being a "democratic government." "The New York Times" and other mouthpieces of the American ruling group have continuously denounced the government led by Fidel Castro for not holding elections and not being a representative government, thereby advocating the subversion of this government.

According to Western news agencies, representatives of the Dominican dictatorship, nurtured by the United States, are likely to re-lodge their so-called accusations of "invasion" against Cuba and Venezuela at the meeting. This country had previously made the same false accusation to the Council of the "Organization of American States" in July, apparently to pave the way for the United States to use the organization to promote the American anti-Cuban conspiracy. In addition, there are reports that the United States will also raise the issue of so-called "communist infiltration" through certain dictatorial countries. The United States hopes to establish interventionist institutions such as "supervisory committees" and "peace committees" through this meeting to "investigate" the internal affairs of certain Latin American countries.

The U.S. Secretary of State arrived in Santiago on the 11th to personally manipulate the meeting. Latin American public opinion pointed out that the U.S. delegation may play a sinister trick at this meeting. It will appear at the meeting as a "peace angel," secretly manipulating certain vassal states to stir up trouble in order to achieve its sinister intentions.

The United States' malicious intention to interfere in Cuba is now obvious. However, the current situation is very different from when the United States used the "Organization of American States" to interfere in Guatemala in 1954. First of all, the Cuban people have united to resolutely defend the revolution and oppose interference. The million-strong demonstration in Havana on July 26th powerfully demonstrated this. Although the Cuban government decided to participate in the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, it decided to oppose any interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

Secondly, as a result of the United States' pursuit of colonialist policies, the contradictions between Latin American countries and the United States have become increasingly acute. According to Latin American news agencies, Venezuela, El Salvador, Chile, and other countries will propose proposals at the meeting that contradict the original intentions of the United States. El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alfredo Ortiz Mancía said that El Salvador will defend the principles of American pride and international rights at the meeting. The Chilean delegation also decided at a meeting to propose two basic motions at the meeting: 1. Establish a Pan-American Standing Committee on Human Rights issues; 2. Recommend that countries that have neither established governments in a democratic manner nor changed governments through regular democratic elections should hold elections within an appropriate period.

Finally, the subversive activities carried out by the United States using Cuban traitors and counter-revolutionary forces have been打击 [dǎ jī, dealt a blow]. Even the tools it relies on to carry out armed attacks against Cuba—the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua—have also experienced armed uprisings against the Trujillo and Somoza dictatorships.

The United States' attempt to interfere in Cuba through the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers has been unanimously condemned by Latin American public opinion.

In Chile, the site of the meeting, a movement to defend Cuba and Venezuela has formed. The Chilean People's Action Front called on all political forces in the country to resolutely condemn the conspiracy to convene this meeting. On the evening of the 11th, the people of the Chilean capital held a grand gathering to welcome the delegations from Cuba and Venezuela. Chilean newspapers such as "El Siglo," "Libertad," "La Hora," and "La Tercera" published commentaries calling for support for Cuba and Venezuela.

On the 11th, the people of the Chilean capital "welcomed" Herter, who had just arrived, by marching and demonstrating in front of the U.S. Embassy. The Chilean government has deployed strict guards around the U.S. Embassy to prevent U.S. officials from suffering the same fate that Nixon suffered during his visit to Latin America last year.

The Argentine "Committee to Support the Cuban Revolution" held a mass rally in support of Cuba on the evening of the 11th. The resounding calls issued at the meeting were: "We must stop the United States from realizing its attempt to invade Cuba through the Organization of American States," "The revolutionary cause of Cuba is the cause of the people of Latin American countries," "Prevent a repeat of the Guatemala incident."

This mass rally was the opening ceremony of the "Week of Support for the Peoples of Latin American Countries" initiated by the "Committee to Support the Cuban Revolution." The meeting hall was packed with people, and Dr. Alejandro Gómez, former Vice President of the country, and other well-known figures attended the meeting.

The National Committee of the Argentine Socialist Party recently issued a statement pointing out that the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers "almost unreservedly attempts to sanction Cuba through the tools currently used by the State Department—the Nicaraguan and Dominican dynasties." The statement expressed support for Cuba's land reform policy, condemned the attempts to invade the Republic of Cuba, and called on the Argentine working people to mobilize to support the Cuban working class.

According to a report in the Chilean newspaper "La Hora Ultima" on the 8th, the Central Committee of the Chilean Socialist Party issued a statement on the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, condemning the purpose of this meeting as "defending the United States' political and economic strategic interests at the expense of the sovereignty of Latin American countries and the freedom of the people," and pointing out that the meeting is an attempt to "save the Trujillo and Somoza dictatorships and eliminate the democratic, popular Cuban government."

The Peruvian People's Party's newspaper "La Tribuna" published an editorial on the 10th, demanding that the Peruvian delegation not participate in the conspiracy against the Cuban revolutionary regime.

　　美国蓄意制造干涉借口　古巴等国坚决维护主权
　　美洲外长会议将展开一场斗争
　　拉丁美洲公众掀起支援古巴的强大运动
    本报综合报道　在美国策动下，属于“美洲国家组织”的二十一个国家的外交部长12日开始在智利首都圣地亚哥举行会议，讨论所谓加勒比海地区的紧张局势。拉丁美洲舆论一再指出，美国策划这次会议，目的是要为进一步干涉古巴准备条件。
    参加美洲外长会议的各国代表团已陆续到达智利首都，并展开了会前活动。
    11日晚上召开了一个秘密的预备会议。据悉，古巴代表团在这次会上提出，所有的会议都应该让记者列席。这个建议得到委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、洪都拉斯和萨尔瓦多等国的支持。这个问题将在12日的正式全体会议上讨论表决。
    以古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚为首的古巴代表团是在11日到达圣地亚哥的。罗亚在机场上对报界说，他的代表团坚持在会议上讨论经济不发达问题的必要性，因为“这是这次会议将讨论的加勒比地区骚乱的原因”。罗亚重申，他的政府反对任何独裁政权，因此也反对特鲁希略独裁政权。他谴责特鲁希略和巴蒂斯塔分子正在酝酿反古巴阴谋。他说，古巴反对成立所谓国际警察部队，因为“这种部队将被用来支持美洲残余的几个独裁政权”。
    委内瑞拉外交部长伊格纳西奥·路易斯·阿卡亚同一天在记者招待会上说，特鲁希略独裁政权是加勒比地区紧张局势的根源。他指出，委内瑞拉和古巴有共同点，两国人民都推翻了独裁制度，今天都受到特鲁希略政权的侵略。他指责“美洲国家组织”保护美洲的独裁政权。
    “美洲国家组织”理事会为这次会议安排的两项议程是：（一）加勒比地区紧张局势；（二）代议制民主的有效实施和尊重人权。据指出，这是美国给古巴设下的两个陷阱。美国蓄意利用这两项议程中的任何一项，作为进一步大张旗鼓地干涉古巴的借口。大家知道，美国的显要官员，从艾森豪威尔到迈阿密参议员斯马瑟斯，通通颠倒黑白地把美国在加勒比海制造的紧张局势说成是推翻掉独裁统治以后成立的古巴新政府造成的。此外，华尔街的代理人还一再毁谤古巴政府不是一个“民主的政府”，“纽约时报”和其他一些美国统治集团喉舌不断怒骂菲德尔·卡斯特罗领导的政府不进行选举，不是代议制政府，借此鼓吹颠复这个政府。
    据西方通讯社报道，受美国豢养的多米尼加独裁政权的代表很可能在会上重新提出它对古巴和委内瑞拉的所谓“入侵”的指控。这个国家曾经在7月间向“美洲国家组织”理事会提出过同一诬告，目的显然是为美国开路，以便利用这个组织推行美国反古巴的阴谋。另外有消息说，美国还将要通过某些独裁国家提出所谓“共产主义渗入”的问题。美国希望通过这次会议成立什么“监督委员会”、“和平委员会”一类干涉机构，来“调查”某些拉丁美洲国家的内政问题。
    美国国务卿已在11日到达圣地亚哥，亲自操纵这次会议。拉丁美洲舆论指出：美国代表团在这次会议上可能要玩弄一套阴险的手法，它将以“和平天使”的面目在会上出现，暗地里却操纵某些仆从国家兴风作浪，以实现它的罪恶企图。
    美国处心积虑干涉古巴的罪恶用心已昭然若揭，但是，当前的形势已同1954年美国利用“美洲国家组织”干涉危地马拉时大大不同了。首先，古巴人民已经团结起来，坚决保卫革命，反对干涉。7月26日哈瓦那的百万人大示威，就有力地显示了这一点。古巴政府虽然决定参加外长会议，但决定反对任何干涉古巴内政的做法。
    其次，由于美国推行殖民主义政策的结果，拉丁美洲国家同美国的矛盾日益尖锐化。据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，委内瑞拉、萨尔瓦多、智利等国将在会议上提出与美国原意相反的提案。萨尔瓦多外交部长阿弗雷多·奥尔蒂斯·曼西亚表示，萨尔多多在会上将保卫作为美洲的骄傲和国际权利的原则。智利代表团团员会议也决定在会上提出两项基本动议：一、建立一个人权问题的泛美常设委员会；二、建议那些既没有按民主方式建立政府也没有通过定期的民主选举改变政府的国家，要在一个适当的时期举行选举。
    最后，美国利用古巴叛徒和反革命势力进行的颠复活动固然受到了打击，就是它所依靠来对古巴实行武装进攻的工具——多米尼加和尼加拉瓜，也都发生了反对特鲁希略和索摩查独裁政权的武装起义。
    美国企图通过美洲国家外长会议干涉古巴的阴谋已受到拉丁美洲舆论的一致痛斥。
    在会场所在地的智利，已经形成一个保卫古巴和委内瑞拉的运动。智利人民行动阵线号召全国一切政治力量都来坚决谴责召开这次会议的阴谋。11日晚上，智利首都人民举行了一次盛大的集会来欢迎古巴和委内瑞拉的代表团。智利的
  “世纪报”、“自由报”、“号角报”和“第三者报”都发表评论，号召支持古巴和委内瑞拉。
    智利首都人民11日以在美国大使馆门前游行示威来“迎接”刚刚到达的赫脱。智利政府已经在美国大使馆周围布置了森严的警卫，以免美国官员遭到尼克松去年在拉丁美洲访问时所遭到的同样命运。
    阿根廷“支持古巴革命委员会”11日晚上召开支持古巴的群众大会。会上发出的响亮的呼声是：“必须阻止美国通过美洲国家组织实现侵略古巴的企图”，“古巴的革命事业是拉丁美洲各国人民的事业”，“阻止重演危地马拉事件”。
    这次群众大会是“支持古巴革命委员会”发起的“支持拉丁美洲各国人民周”的开幕式。会议大厅中挤满了人，出席这次会议的有国家前副总统亚历杭德里·戈麦斯博士和其他知名人士。
    阿根廷会社党全国委员会最近发表声明，指出美洲外长会议“几乎毫不掩饰它的企图：通过目前国务院利用的工具——尼加拉瓜和多米尼加王朝来制裁古巴”。声明表示支持古巴的土地改革政策，谴责对古巴共和国的侵略企图，号召阿根廷劳动人民动员起来支持古巴的劳动阶级。
    据智利“最后一点钟报”8日报道，智利社会党中央委员会就美洲外长会议发表了声明，声明谴责这次会议的目的是“在损害拉丁美洲国家的主权和人民自由的情况下，保卫美国政治上和经济上的战略利益”，并且指出，这次会议是企图“拯救特鲁希略、索摩查独裁制度和消灭民主的、人民的古巴政府”。
    秘鲁人民党机关报“论坛报”10日发表社论，要求秘鲁代表团不要参与反对古巴革命政权的阴谋。
