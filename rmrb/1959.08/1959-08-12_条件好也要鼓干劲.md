　　Even with Good Conditions, We Must Boost Our Enthusiasm
　　Wang Pu
    The Shanghai Boiler Factory and the Casting Bright Iron Factory have improved their production outlook after overcoming the slackening mood of some cadres. This fact tells us that we must not relax our efforts not only when production encounters difficulties, but also when production conditions are relatively good and there are fewer difficulties. It is very wrong to think that because conditions are good and the plan is "sure" to be completed, there is no need to boost our enthusiasm.
    All our plans should strive to conform to objective reality. The objective reality of production includes two aspects: one is the objective possibility of material and technical conditions, and the other is the subjective initiative of the workers. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "No one can think wildly without basis, nor can anyone plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and do not force themselves to do things that are really impossible." Plans that are not based on the objective possibility of certain material and technical conditions cannot be realized. However, if we only consider the objective possibility of material and technical conditions and do not simultaneously consider the subjective initiative of the workers, that is, revolutionary enthusiasm, then we will make the mistake of falling behind objective reality. We do not need plans that exceed the objective reality, nor do we need plans that fall behind the objective reality. What we want is a plan that combines the objective possibility of material and technical conditions with the subjective initiative of the workers. This is what our party has always advocated. However, a reliable plan does not mean that there are no difficulties, and a plan with difficulties does not mean that it is unreliable. If we blindly become optimistic because the plan is reliable and the conditions are relatively good, and we don't even bother to boost our enthusiasm, and we don't actively do things that can be done through subjective effort, then of course it is not right. In this way, a plan that was originally "sure" to be completed may "fail."
    Under certain material and technical conditions, revolutionary enthusiasm is the decisive factor in the quality of production and the driving force for advancing all revolutionary undertakings. No matter what position we are in, we must always boost our enthusiasm and always strive for the top. When production encounters difficulties, we must have ambition, be full of enthusiasm, and throw ourselves into the mass movement with confidence, and work with the workers to find ways to overcome difficulties and move forward.
    When production is relatively smooth, we must also boost our enthusiasm, be conscientious and meticulous, make persistent efforts, ride the wind and set sail, give full play to the subjective initiative of the workers, and give full play to the role of good material and technical conditions, do more things, and under the arrangement of the national plan, strive for more, faster, better, and more economical, and achieve an all-round great leap forward. This is in line with the spirit of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 条件好也要鼓干劲

　　条件好也要鼓干劲
　　王朴
    上海锅炉厂和铸明铁工厂克服了部分干部松劲情绪以后生产面貌改观。这个事实告诉我们，不但在生产遇到困难的时候，要鼓足干劲，就是在生产条件比较好，困难比较少的时候，也松劲不得。以为条件好，计划“笃定”能完成，因而就不需要鼓足干劲了，这种想法是很不正确的。
    我们的一切计划都应力求符合客观实际。生产的客观实际包括两个方面，一是物质技术条件的客观可能性，二是职工群众的主观能动作用。毛泽东同志教导我们：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”计划不建立在一定的物质技术条件的客观可能性上，是实现不了的。但是，如果只考虑物质技术条件的客观可能性，而不同时考虑职工群众的主观能动作用，即革命干劲，那末就会犯落在客观实际后面的错误。我们不需要超越客观实际许可的计划，也不需要落在客观实际后面的计划。我们要的是把物质技术条件的客观可能性和职工群众的主观能动性结合起来的计划。这是我们党一向所提倡的。但是，可靠的计划不等于没有困难，有困难的计划也不等于不可靠。如果以为计划可靠了，条件比较好了，就盲目地乐观起来，连干劲也不鼓了，连经过主观努力可以办到的事情也不积极去办了，那当然是不对的。这样，本来是“笃定”能完成的计划也可能会“落空”的。
    在一定的物质技术条件下，革命干劲是生产好坏的决定因素，是推动一切革命事业前进的动力。不论在什么岗位上，我们都要时时鼓足干劲，时时力争上游。在生产遇到困难的时候，要有志气，干劲充沛，满怀信心地投到群众运动中去，和职工群众一道想办法，战胜困难前进。
    在生产比较顺利的时候，也要鼓足干劲，兢兢业业，再接再厉，乘风扬帆，充分地发挥职工群众的主观能动作用，充分发挥良好的物质技术条件的作用，办更多的事情，在国家计划安排下，力求多了还要多，快了还要快，好了还要好，省了还要省，要全面大跃进。这才符合于鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的精神。
