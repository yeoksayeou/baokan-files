Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The capital's people have achieved a brilliant victory in the first three-day sanitary assault, which concluded victoriously today.

According to the seasonal characteristics, this campaign focused on eliminating mosquito and fly breeding conditions. At the start of the campaign, the broad masses of workers, cadres, soldiers, students, and urban and rural residents concentrated their efforts, first fiercely attacking mosquito and fly breeding grounds. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three days, urban and suburban areas have filled in more than 22,000 water-filled pits and puddles, filled 174,000 square meters of land, and dredged 333 ditches with a total length of more than 87,000 meters, and removed weeds from 3.6 million square meters of area where mosquitoes are easily hidden. Various districts extensively sprayed pesticides on places where mosquitoes and flies breed. Factories, shops, government offices, schools, and residential courtyards were generally cleaned, and large-scale fumigation was carried out in areas with more mosquitoes and flies. After this assault, many advanced units and regions with no mosquitoes and flies emerged throughout the city.

This assault movement was rapid and widespread. After the Municipal Patriotic Health Movement Committee deployed this assault, various districts and street offices held meetings overnight to mobilize and deploy, and the combat goals of the movement quickly became known to every household and quickly entered the battle.

During this assault movement, many responsible comrades from central government departments, municipal and district levels went to the front line to participate in the battle. In many areas and units, the number of participants in the assault greatly exceeded the estimated number. All districts concentrated their superior forces to attack key areas where mosquitoes and flies breed more. Xicheng District and Chongwen District focused on Yuetan, Longtan, and the Guancheng outside Yongdingmen, and Chaoyang District focused on the industrial concentrated area of ​​Jiu Xianqiao, mobilizing tens of thousands of people from government agencies, factories, and schools to concentrate on the assault, destroying a large number of mosquito and fly breeding grounds and eliminating countless mosquitoes and flies. More than 600 officers and soldiers and family members of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, led by the leaders of the unit, cooperated with eight nearby units to remove weeds from an area of ​​110,000 square meters. The broad masses of the people tried every means to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. Urban and suburban areas widely set up fly traps, trap points, and flypaper to kill flies, and used nets and soap-coated basins to swat flying mosquitoes. While conducting drug fumigation and spraying, some areas used local materials and wild plants to eliminate fly maggots and mosquito larvae.

According to the person in charge of the Municipal Patriotic Health Movement Committee, the main reasons for the significant achievements of this campaign are: party committees at all levels took the initiative and gave priority to politics; deployment was meticulous and planning was thorough; all units implemented large-scale cooperation. During the movement, the first secretaries of the district party committees in the urban areas personally commanded the battle. Various districts used radio stations, propaganda teams, blackboards, and mass meetings to conduct in-depth and meticulous publicity activities to the people of the city, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. Before the start of the movement, various districts conducted investigations and research, clarified the situation, and organized the forces. All units cooperated closely with each other in the movement.

In order to consolidate and expand the results of this campaign, the Municipal Patriotic Health Movement Committee requested that all districts and systems make persistent efforts, advance victoriously, and actively prepare for the next campaign. The city's second sanitary assault has been decided to be carried out from the 22nd to the 26th of this month. (Attached picture)

　　北京首次卫生突击战告捷
    新华社11日讯　首都人民为时三天的第一个卫生突击战役取得了辉煌战绩，于今天胜利结束。
    根据季节特点，这次战役是以消灭蚊蝇孳生条件为中心。战役开始，广大的工人、干部、战士、学生和城乡居民，集中力量，首先猛攻蚊蝇老巢。据不完全统计，三天以来，城郊区共填垫了二万二千多个积水坑洼，填土十七万四千多平方米，疏通了长度共达八万七千多米的三百三十三条沟渠，在容易隐藏蚊子的三百六十万平方米的面积上拔除了杂草。各区对孳生蚊蝇的场所，广泛进行了药物喷射。工厂、商店、机关、学校和居民的住宅院落等普遍进行了打扫，蚊蝇较多的地方进行了大规模的烟熏。经过这次突击，全市涌现出很多无蚊无蝇的先进单位和地区。
    这次突击运动行动迅速、广泛，市爱国卫生运动委员会部署这次突击战役后，各区、各街道办事处连夜开会，进行动员、布置，运动的战斗目标很快就做到家喻户晓，并迅速投入了战斗。
    在这次突击运动中，中央机关、市级和区级的许多负责同志，亲临前线，参加战斗。很多地区和单位，参加突击的人数，都大大超过了预计的人数。各区都集中优势兵力，突击孳生蚊蝇较多的重点地区。西城区和崇文区以月坛、龙潭和永定门外关厢为重点，朝阳区以酒仙桥工业集中的地区为重点，发动机关、工厂、学校上万的人集中突击，捣毁了大量蚊蝇老巢，消灭了无数蚊蝇。中国人民解放军某部六百多名官兵和家属，在部队首长的带领下，和附近八个单位协作，在十一万平方米的面积上拔除了杂草。广大群众千方百计扑灭蚊蝇，城郊区广设捕蝇笼、诱扑点、毒蝇纸、扑灭苍蝇，并使用网兜和涂有肥皂的脸盆扑打飞蚊。在进行药物烟熏和喷射的同时，有些地区就地取材、采用野生植物消灭蝇蛆和孑孓。
    据市爱国卫生运动委员会负责人说，这次战役取得显著成绩的主要原因是：各级党委亲自动手，政治挂帅；部署细致，计划周密；各单位实行了大协作。运动中，城区各区区委第一书记都亲自指挥战斗。各区运用广播站，宣传队、黑板报，召开群众片会等方式，向全市人民进行了深入细致的宣传活动，大大鼓舞了群众的积极性。运动开始前，各区都进行了调查研究，摸清了情况、组织好了力量。各单位在运动中密切合作互相配合。
    为了巩固和扩大这次战役的战果，市爱国卫生运动委员会要求各区各系统再接再厉，乘胜前进，积极做好下个战役的准备工作。全市第二次卫生突击战役已决定在本月22日至26日进行。（附图片）
