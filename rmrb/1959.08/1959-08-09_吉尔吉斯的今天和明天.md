    Kyrgyzstan's Today and Tomorrow
    By Jikamabayev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Kyrgyzstan

    In the past, Kyrgyzstan was one of the most backward regions of Tsarist Russia in terms of economy and culture. Under the Soviet system, with the constant help of Russia and other nationalities of the Soviet Union, the Kyrgyz people have achieved economic and agricultural prosperity and a high level of material and spiritual life. Now, Kyrgyzstan is a socialist republic with a thriving industry and collective agriculture, and well-developed culture, science, literature, and art.

    During the years of Soviet power, Kyrgyzstan has established new heavy industry, light industry, and food industry, as well as large-scale mechanized socialist agriculture. In 1958, the republic's total industrial output value exceeded the 1913 level by forty-nine times. Now, the industrial products produced in eight days are equal to the output of the entire year before the revolution. In the last three years alone, twelve new large industrial enterprises have been put into production, including a physical instrument factory, the Kara-Suu coal mine, the "Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution" factory (the largest wool producer in Kyrgyzstan), a reinforced concrete structure factory, a bicycle assembly factory, and so on.

    In the republic's agriculture, there are more than 15,000 tractors, 5,200 combine harvesters, 7,800 trucks, and many other machines. The agricultural technology of collective farms and state farms and the yield of various crops are constantly improving.

    Our republic pays special attention to national education. In Kyrgyzstan, there are 1,752 primary and secondary schools, and dozens of higher and secondary specialized schools, which train national cadres for various sectors of the national economy and culture. At present, the level of educational development in Kyrgyzstan has surpassed that of many capitalist countries. For example, in Kyrgyzstan, the number of children studying in primary and secondary schools per thousand residents is twice as many as in Pakistan and one times as many as in Turkey; the number of college students studying in universities per thousand residents is twice as many as in France and five times as many as in Turkey.

    Following the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party, the Soviet people began to implement the great Seven-Year Plan. The main task of the Seven-Year Plan is to ensure further huge upsurges in all economic sectors on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and to achieve new and greater improvements in the people's living standards.

    By 1965, the absolute output of some important Soviet products will exceed that of the United States, while other products will approach the current level of U.S. industrial production. By 1965, the output of the most important crops in socialist agriculture, both in terms of total output and per capita output, will exceed the current U.S. level. After the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan, the proportion of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist system in world industrial production will greatly increase, accounting for more than half of the world's total industrial output by 1965.

    The control figures for the development of the national economy in the Soviet Union in the recent seven years also stipulate further and greatly developing the economy and culture of the various union republics. A broad prospect is unfolding before Kyrgyzstan.

    In the recent seven years, the total investment in capital construction in the republic will be 10.5 billion rubles, which is 1.3 times more than the investment in capital construction in the past seven years. The total industrial output value will increase by 1.2 times. Ferrous metallurgy, coal, petroleum, machine manufacturing, light industry, and food industry are being further developed. New sectors in the national economy, such as the gas industry and the chemical industry, are also being established. In all industrial sectors, special attention will be paid to adopting new technologies and new technological regulations, and realizing mechanization and automation.

    During the seven years, we will overcome the state where the development of the power base lags behind the speed of economic development and the ever-increasing needs of the working people. It is expected that by the end of the Seven-Year Plan, electricity production will increase by 2.6 times compared to 1958. To this end, many huge power stations will be built. By that time, Kyrgyzstan will change from a republic that needs to be supplied with electricity by others to a republic that can not only meet its own needs in electricity production but also supply neighboring republics.

    Currently, huge amounts of funds are being invested in the coal industry in order to carry out basic construction work on the coal mines that are in production and complete the construction of major mine shafts. A large amount of funds (more than one billion rubles) is being invested in the republic's oil industry and gasoline industry. Oil extraction in 1965 will increase by two times compared to 1958. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, 2.08 billion cubic meters of gas will be produced. The Tashkent-Chimgan-Jambul-Frunze-Alma-Ata gas pipeline will be completed and put into use. In this way, industrial and residential gas will be supplied by gas pipelines, and Kyrgyzstan will get rid of the situation of transporting coal from long distances.

    The rapid development of the power base will create the necessary conditions for the republic to establish a chemical industry. It is planned to establish a chemical complex in Kyrgyzstan on the basis of natural gas production, which will produce mineral fertilizers and raw materials for manufacturing synthetic fibers and other synthetic materials.

    Kyrgyzstan's production of mercury and antimony occupies an important position in the Soviet Union. In the recent seven years, the production of these mines will be greatly increased.

    The production of daily necessities will develop at a high speed. The production of wool fabrics in 1965 will increase by 12.7 times compared to 1958, and cotton fabrics will increase by 79 times. The production of knitted goods, shoes, various clothing, etc. will also be greatly increased. The use of synthetic materials and artificial fibers in light industry will increase by four times.

    The meat, dairy, and oil industries will develop rapidly. The production of sugar, winemaking, canned fruits and vegetables, pastries, and other foods will also be greatly developed.

    The republic's agriculture will develop towards specialization in the production of cotton, sugar beet, meat, and the breeding of fine-wool sheep and semi-fine-wool sheep. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the production of sugar beet will increase by 20%-30% compared to 1958, meat will increase by about 1.8 times, and milk will increase by 1.2 to 1.4 times. It is planned to open up some new orchards and vineyards, with an area of about 30,000 hectares. In order to expand the irrigated area, the Chuysk Grand Canal and several large reservoirs will be built. Great work will be carried out in improving the existing irrigation network.

    On the basis of the high-speed development of the national economy, the material and cultural living standards of the Kyrgyz people will be further improved. By 1960, the working day for all workers and staff in various sectors of the national economy will be six to seven hours. Housing will be built on a large scale. Funding for cultural development will increase by 1.4 times compared to the previous seven years.

    The new tasks of Soviet communist construction have raised the requirements for training specialized talents in schools and universities. Therefore, like the rest of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan will carry out huge work to reform the teaching in primary and secondary schools and universities in order to better train young people to engage in labor for social welfare.

    Such are the tasks that lie before Kyrgyzstan in the recent seven years. The growing creative enthusiasm of the working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals, and the level of economic, scientific, and cultural development that Kyrgyzstan has reached, are the guarantees for completing these tasks.

    吉尔吉斯的今天和明天
    苏联吉尔吉斯苏维埃社会主义共和国部长会议主席  季卡姆巴耶夫
    过去，吉尔吉斯在经济和文化方面都是沙皇俄国最落后的地区之一。在苏维埃制度下，吉尔吉斯人民在俄罗斯和苏联其他民族的经常帮助下，获得了工业、农业的繁荣并使物质和精神生活达到高度水平。现在，吉尔吉斯是一个工业和集体农业繁荣兴旺的社会主义共和国，文化、科学和文学艺术都很发达。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，吉尔吉斯建立了新的重工业、轻工业和食品工业，还建立了大规模的机械化的社会主义农业。1958年共和国的工业生产总值超过1913年水平的四十九倍。现在，八天中生产的工业产品，就等于革命前全年的产量。仅在最近三年内就有十二个新的大工业企业投入生产，其中有物理仪器工厂、卡拉苏煤矿、在吉尔吉斯生产毛织品最多的“十月革命四十年”工厂、钢筋混凝土结构工厂、自行车装配工厂，等等。
    在共和国的农业中，拥有一万五千多部拖拉机、五千二百部联合收割机、七千八百部载重汽车和许多其他机器。集体农庄和国营农场的农业技术和各种农作物的产量不断提高。
    我们共和国特别注意国民教育工作，在吉尔吉斯有一千七百五十二所中小学校，几十所高等和中等专科学校，这些专科学校为国民经济和文化各个部门培养民族干部。目前，吉尔吉斯的教育发展水平已经超过了许多资本主义国家。例如，在吉尔吉斯，每一千名居民中在中小学校学习的儿童比巴基斯坦多两倍，比土耳其多一倍；每一千名居民中在高等学校学习的大学生比法国多一倍，比土耳其多五倍。
    在党的第二十一次代表大会的历史性决议以后，苏联人民开始实现伟大的七年计划。七年计划的主要任务是，在优先发展重工业的基础上保证所有经济部门进一步巨大高涨，使人民生活水平得到新的更大的提高。
    到1965年，苏联某些重要产品的绝对产量将超过美国，而其他的产品将接近目前的美国工业生产水平。到1965年，社会主义农业中最重要作物的产量，不论是总产量和按人口平均计算的产量，都将超过目前的美国水平。七年计划实现以后，苏联和整个社会主义体系在世界工业生产中所占的比重将大大提高，到1965年，将占世界全部工业产量一半以上。
    最近七年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字中还规定进一步大大发展各加盟共和国的经济和文化。在吉尔吉斯面前展现出广阔的前景。
    在最近七年间，共和国基本建设的投资总额为一百零五亿卢布，比过去七年基本建设投资多一点三倍。工业总产值将增加一点二倍。黑色冶金、煤炭、石油、机器制造、轻工业和食品工业正在进一步发展。国民经济中的新部门——煤气工业和化学工业也在建立中。在所有的工业部门中将特别注意采用新的技术和新的工艺规程，实现机械化和自动化。
    七年期间，我们将克服动力基地的发展落后于经济发展速度和劳动人民日益增长的需要的状态。预计到七年计划末，电力生产将比1958年增加二点六倍，为此将建设许多巨大的电站。到那时，吉尔吉斯将从一个需要别人供应电力的共和国变成一个在电力生产方面不仅可以满足需要，而且还能供应邻近共和国的共和国。
    目前，正把巨额资金投入煤炭工业以便使正在生产的煤矿实现基本建设工作和完成主要矿井的建设。大量的资金（十亿卢布以上）投入共和国的石油工业和汽油工业。1965年的石油开采量将比1958年增加两倍。到七年计划末，将生产二十亿零八千万立方公尺的煤气。塔什干—奇木干—江布尔—伏龙芝—阿拉木图煤气管将建成并开始使用。这样，将由煤气管供应工业和居民煤气，吉尔吉斯将摆脱从远距离运输煤的处境。
    动力基地的迅速发展将为共和国建立化学工业创造必要的条件。计划在吉尔吉斯出产天然煤气的基地上建立化学联合企业，这个企业将生产矿物质肥料和制造人造纤维及其他合成材料的原料。
    吉尔吉斯的水银和锑的生产在苏联占重要地位。在最近七年中这些矿的生产将大大增加。
    生活必需品的生产将以高速度地发展。1965年毛织品的生产将比1958年增加十二点七倍，棉织品增加七十九倍。针织品、鞋、各种服装等等的生产也将大大增加。在轻工业中合成材料和人造纤维的利用将增加四倍。
    肉类、奶类和制油工业将以很快的速度发展。制糖、葡萄酒酿制业、水果和蔬菜罐头、糕点和其他食品的生产也将大大发展。
    共和国的农业将向生产棉花、甜菜、肉类和饲养细毛羊、半细毛羊的专业化方面发展。到七年计划末，甜菜的生产将比1958年增加20％—30％，肉类约增加一点八倍，奶类增加一点二至一点四倍。计划开辟一些新的果园和葡萄园，面积约达三万公顷。为了扩大灌溉面积，要建成楚依斯克大运河和几个大蓄水库。在改善现有的灌溉网的方面将进行巨大的工作。
    在国民经济高速度发展的基础上，将进一步提高吉尔吉斯人民的物质和文化生活水平。到1960年，国民经济各个部门的所有工人和职员的工作日将为六至七小时。将大规模建设住宅。文化生活建设的资金将比前七年增加一点四倍。
    苏联共产主义建设的新任务提高了对学校和高等学校中训练专门人才的要求。因此，同全苏联一样，吉尔吉斯将对中小学校和高等学校的教学改革进行巨大工作，以便更好地培养青年从事社会公益的劳动。
    最近七年，摆在吉尔吉斯面前的就是这样一些任务。工人阶级、集体农民和知识分子日益增长的创造积极性和吉尔吉斯已达到的经济、科学和文化的发展水平，就是完成这些任务的保证。（附图片）
