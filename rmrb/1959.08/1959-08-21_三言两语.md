    Brief Remarks

    △ “Ambition knows no age.” We should also add: “Ambition persists even in old age.” Young seedlings basking in the sun and old pines weathered by wind and frost are both treasures of nature.

    △ There is a saying in my hometown: "Holding onto one's braid while crossing the bridge," which vividly describes the demeanor of someone who is timid as a mouse. But at least he dares to cross the bridge. Even worse are those who sit by the bridge, waiting for someone to carry them across.

    △ Wu Song used his fists to fight the tiger because his staff unfortunately broke into two pieces on the tree. If he deliberately discarded his good staff and fought the tiger empty-handed to show off his strength, then he wouldn't be a hero.

    三言两语
    △　“有志不在年高”。应该还加一句：“有志哪怕年老”。受着阳光煦照的幼苗，经历了风霜的老松，同样是自然界中的珍宝。
    △　我乡有句俗语：“?住了辫子过桥”，把胆小如鼠者的神态形容得维妙维肖。但是他总还敢于过桥。下焉者，就是坐在桥边，等人家把他抬过去。
    △　武松用拳头打虎，为了他的哨棒不幸在树上折成了两截。假使他故意丢掉了好好的哨棒，空手和老虎搏斗，以示力大，那么他也不是好汉了。
