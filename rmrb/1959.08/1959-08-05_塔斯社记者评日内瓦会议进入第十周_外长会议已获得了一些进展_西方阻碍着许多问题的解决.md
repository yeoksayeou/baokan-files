Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 4th, TASS Dispatch: TASS special correspondent reports: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference entered its tenth week today. Many Swiss newspapers are attempting to draw some conclusions and evaluate the possible prospects of the negotiations. It is noteworthy that only a very small number of observers tend to believe that the conference seems to have done nothing and achieved nothing. On the contrary, the view that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has done a lot of useful work is dominant. "Schweizerische Zeitung" wrote: "Of course, this does not mean that the foreign ministers who came to Geneva should abandon the positions they have stubbornly defended for a long time. However, they are now able to find mutually acceptable ways of compromise more easily."

Of course, despite the length of the negotiations, many issues have not been resolved due to the Western countries' unrealistic attitude because they are too easily influenced by Bonn's pressure. When discussing the issue of a provisional agreement on West Berlin, the Western countries stubbornly refused to reduce their troops stationed in West Berlin, and they have also adopted a non-constructive attitude on the issue of the validity period of the provisional agreement. All this proves that the three Western powers have not abandoned their attempt to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin indefinitely.

The Soviet and German Democratic Republic governments' proposals to establish an all-German committee or to organize negotiations between the two German states in some way to discuss such extremely important and pressing issues as the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, German reunification, and contact between the two German states, have not yet been understood by the Western countries. In short, the difficulties in reaching mutually acceptable agreements at the Geneva Conference have not been completely eliminated.

However, when evaluating the Geneva Conference process, it is incorrect and not objective to only see these difficulties and not see the rapprochement on a series of issues due to the joint efforts of both sides.

As everyone knows, the Soviet delegation came to Geneva with a plan to completely resolve the West Berlin issue. This plan was to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. However, since an agreement could not be sought on the basis of this plan, the Soviet delegation suggested reaching an agreement on the conclusion of a provisional agreement on West Berlin. The principle of concluding a provisional agreement itself was supported by the Western countries, which is a positive result of the discussion of this proposal at the Geneva Conference. Indeed, the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France also contain some points that are inconsistent with this principle, and the direct purpose of these points is essentially to maintain the status quo in West Berlin; but the significance of the fact that the three Western powers accepted the principle of a provisional agreement cannot be denied. By the way, Swiss newspapers, especially the commentator Kuritzel of "Lausanne Gazette," also reminded people of this.

Outside the Geneva Conference venue, it is believed that the fact that the possibility of reaching an agreement on the issue of not conducting hostile propaganda and subversive activities against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries has emerged, and that West Berlin is the center for carrying out such activities, is also of considerable significance.

In fact, an agreement has already been reached on the issue of not deploying atomic weapons and rocket weapons in West Berlin. This also shows that the Geneva Conference has taken a step forward in reaching mutually acceptable agreements.

It is particularly noteworthy that neither among the many foreign journalists who came to Geneva to cover the Foreign Ministers' Conference nor in the Swiss newspapers can one now hear and see the extremely pessimistic "predictions" spread by the opponents of the agreement throughout the conference. Even the bourgeois "Schweizerische Zeitung" pointed out that the claim that "the conference has not achieved any results" is incorrect. This newspaper also rightly pointed out the important fact that the ongoing Geneva negotiations help "create a favorable atmosphere for future East-West negotiations."

### 塔斯社记者评日内瓦会议进入第十周  外长会议已获得了一些进展  西方阻碍着许多问题的解决

    塔斯社记者评日内瓦会议进入第十周
    外长会议已获得了一些进展
    西方阻碍着许多问题的解决
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社日内瓦3日讯：塔斯社特派记者报道：日内瓦外长会议今天进入了第十周。许多瑞士报纸在试图作出某些结论和评价谈判可能出现的前景。值得注意的是，只有为数极少的观察家倾向于认为，似乎会议什么也没做，什么也没达到。与此相反，认为外长会议做了不少有益的工作的观点却占优势。“瑞士报”写道：“当然，这里所指的不是要使到日内瓦来的外长们放弃他们长期来顽强维护着的立场。但是，现在他们能够比较容易地找到彼此都能接受的让步的途径。”
    当然，尽管谈判时间很长，但是由于西方国家太容易受波恩压力的影响因而采取了不现实的态度，以致许多问题未能得到解决。在讨论关于西柏林临时协定这一问题时，西方国家一味顽固拒绝减少它们驻在西柏林的军队，在临时协定的有效期限问题上，它们也一直采取并非建设性的态度。所有这一切都证明，西方三国并没有放弃它们要无限期保持西柏林占领制度的企图。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国政府关于建立全德委员会或采取某种方式来组织两个德国的谈判，以便讨论像缔结对德和约、德国统一和两个德国的接触这样一些极其重要和刻不容缓的问题的建议，至今还没有得到西方国家的谅解。总之，在日内瓦会议上达成相互都能接受的协议的困难仍然没有完全消除。
    但是，在评价日内瓦会议过程时，只看到这些困难，而没有看到由于双方的共同努力而在一系列问题上有了接近，这是不对的，不客观的。
    大家知道，苏联代表团是带着彻底解决西柏林问题的计划来到日内瓦的。这个计划是要把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市。但是，既然在这个计划的基础上未能寻求到协议，苏联代表团就建议在缔结西柏林临时协定方面达成协议，缔结一项临时协定的原则本身得到了西方国家的支持，这是在日内瓦会议上讨论这个建议的积极结果。的确，在美、英、法三国的建议中也包含着不符合这个原则的一些要点，这些要点的直接目的在实质上是维持西柏林的现状；但是不能否认西方三国接受一项临时协定的原则这件事的意义。顺便提一下，瑞士报纸，特别是“洛桑日报”的评论员库里采尔也提醒人们注意这一点。
    在日内瓦会议会场以外，人们认为这样一个事实也有不小意义：已经出现了就不准对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家进行敌视宣传和颠覆活动问题达成协议的可能性，而西柏林则是进行这种活动的中心。
    实际上，已经就不在西柏林配置原子武器和火箭武器的问题达成了协议。这件事也表明，日内瓦会议在达成相互都能接受的协议方面前进了一步。
    特别值得注意的是，无论是在前来日内瓦采访外长会议消息的许多外国记者中，还是在瑞士报纸上，现在都听不到和看不到协议的反对者在整个会议过程中所散布的那种极其悲观的“预言”。就连资产阶级的“瑞士报”也指出，所谓“会议没有得到任何结果”的说法是不正确的。这家报纸还正当地指出了这样一个重要的情况：正在继续举行的日内瓦谈判有助于“为将来的东西方谈判创造有利的气氛”。
