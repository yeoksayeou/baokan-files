    In the "Ukraine" Collective Farm

    The "Ukraine" Collective Farm is located in "Zelinjia" Village, Khmelnytsky Oblast, Soviet Union, owning nearly three thousand hectares of land, three thousand livestock, and many poultry. This is one of tens of thousands of collective farms in the Soviet Union. Last year, the "Ukraine" Collective Farm averaged 52 quintals of corn, 28 quintals of other grains, and 438 quintals of sugar beets per hectare; it produced 510 quintals of milk and 163 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land, while the United States averaged only 141 quintals of milk and 42 quintals of meat.

    The wealth that the "Ukraine" Collective Farm possesses today did not fall from the sky, nor was it inherited from ancestors, but was obtained by the farmers through collective labor following the path indicated by the Party.

    Before the October Revolution, "Zelinjia" Village was a very remote corner, half of the land belonged to landlords, and the peasants were cruelly exploited. After the revolution, collective farms were established, but in the early days, the farmers encountered numerous difficulties: there were no machines, no experience, and the rich peasants everywhere promoted opposition to the collective farms, they poisoned public livestock and burned down crops. But with the help of the state, the collective farm finally overcame these difficulties and grew stronger step by step. In 1941, "Zelinjia" Village became a battlefield of the Great Patriotic War. After the fascist bandits retreated to "Zelinjia" Village under the blows of the Soviet army, they carried out rampant burning and killing, turning the entire village into ashes. Despite this, the "Ukraine" Collective Farm stood up again in the ruins, and now its brilliant achievements are displayed at the Soviet exhibition recently held in New York, winning the praise of the American people.

### 在“乌克兰”集体农庄里

    在“乌克兰”集体农庄里
    “乌克兰”集体农庄位于苏联赫麦尔尼茨州“植林家”村，拥有将近三千公顷土地、三千头牲口和许许多多的家禽。这是苏联几万个集体农庄中的一个。去年，“乌克兰”集体农庄平均每公顷产玉蜀黍五十二公担、其他谷物二十八公担、甜菜四百三十八公担；每百公顷农业用地生产了五百一十公担牛奶和一百六十三公担肉，而美国平均只达到一百四十一公担牛奶和四十二公担肉。
      “乌克兰”集体农庄今天所拥有的财富，并不是从天上掉下来的，也不是从祖辈继承来的，而是农民遵循党指示的道路用集体的劳动获得的。
    十月革命前，“植林家”村是个十分偏僻的角落，土地一半都归地主所有，农民受到残酷的剥削。革命后，成立了集体农庄，但是在初期的时候农民遇到了重重的困难：没有机器、没有经验，而且富农到处宣传反对集体农庄，他们毒死了公有的牲口，放火烧毁了庄稼。但是集体农庄在国家的帮助下，终于克服了这些困难，一步步地成长壮大起来。1941年，“植林家”村又变成了伟大卫国战争的战场。法西斯德寇在苏军的打击之下退却到“植林家”村后，大肆烧杀，把全村化为灰烬。尽管如此，“乌克兰”集体农庄在废墟中重新站立起来，而如今它的辉煌成就展示在不久前在纽约展出的苏联展览会上，博得了美国人民的赞扬。（附图片）
