  Carrying out popular science activities centered around production
    Shaanxi Science and Technology Association work actively

    (This newspaper reports) Science and Technology Associations at all levels in Shaanxi Province, while striving to strengthen the mass science and technology network, actively popularize scientific and technological knowledge, and promote the vigorous development of mass scientific research activities.

    Science and Technology Association organizations at all levels in Shaanxi Province have extensively absorbed workers, farmers, and advanced innovators with production experience. A total of 1,332 grassroots organizations of the Science and Technology Association have been established in people's communes, schools, government offices, factories, mines, enterprises, hospitals, and farms in the 52 counties and cities of the province. A mass science and technology network is taking shape. According to incomplete statistics from 26 counties and cities such as Pucheng, Sanyuan, and Mianxian, 17,716 members of the Science and Technology Association have been developed, including 2,926 workers and farmers. A science army combining foreign and indigenous methods is growing.

    In order to impart scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses, Science and Technology Associations at all levels, closely integrated with production, and carried out popularization activities in small and diverse ways, adapting to the time, place, and people. According to incomplete statistics, lectures on scientific and technological knowledge have been given to the masses, cadres, and troops millions of times; science and technology exhibitions have been held more than 10,000 times. In addition, popularization and propaganda were widely carried out through other methods such as on-site meetings, "treasure shows," science evenings, art galleries, radio broadcasts, and blackboard newspapers. Science and technology courses were also opened in spare-time schools throughout the province. In cooperation with relevant departments, 1,262 short-term technical training classes were held in people's communes, factories, mines, enterprises, and government agencies, cultivating a large number of scientific and technological talents. For example, the chemical fertilizer plant run by the Sanyuan Chengguan Commune Science and Technology Association group in the manure accumulation campaign successfully trial-produced more than 20 kinds of chemical fertilizers in just a few days, which played a significant role in production. According to the characteristics of mountainous areas, Science and Technology Associations in various parts of Ankang have opened various factories, extracted various rare metals, and used wild plants to make various new products, which have strongly supported national construction and played a role in changing the face of mountainous areas.

    Science and Technology Associations in various places pay attention to organizing intellectuals and workers and peasants to combine and carry out scientific research activities together, and have achieved many gratifying achievements. Zhu Tianyou, a professor at Northwest Agricultural College, and Liu Hengjie, a farmer known as "Living Luban," jointly created a small animal-powered wheat harvester, which won a special prize at the National Agricultural Tool Evaluation Conference, playing a good role in promoting the widespread technological innovation movement.

    With the improvement of the cultural and knowledge level of the broad masses, Science and Technology Associations in various places have published a large number of scientific and technological publicity materials on the basis of summarizing the production experience of the masses. The province's Science and Technology Association has published 491 kinds of popular science books and science loose-leaf materials, totaling more than 3.8 million copies. Most of the special districts, counties and cities Science and Technology Associations have also published popular readings. These include regular science and technology newspapers and periodicals and irregular publicity booklets. These publicity materials are short, concise, easy to understand, and are very popular among the broad masses, becoming a powerful tool for the broad masses to guide production.

    围绕生产开展科普活动
    陕西科学技术协会工作活跃
    本报讯　陕西省各地科学技术协会，一面努力壮大群众性的科学技术网，一面积极普及科学技术知识，促进群众性的科学研究活动蓬勃发展。
    陕西省各地科学技术协会组织，大量地吸收了具有生产经验的工人、农民和生产中的先进革新者。全省五十二个县市中的人民公社、学校、机关、厂矿、企业、医院、农场等单位，建立了科学技术协会基层组织一千三百三十二个。一个群众性的科学技术网正在形成。据蒲城、三原、沔县等二十六个县市不完全统计，发展科学技术协会会员一万七千七百一十六名。其中工农群众二千九百二十六人。一支洋土结合的科学大军正在成长着。
    各级科学技术协会为了把科学技术知识传授给广大群众，紧密地结合生产，因时、因地、因人制宜地开展了小型多样为主的普及活动。据不完全统计，向群众、干部、军队等作科学技术知识讲演达百万次；举办科学技术展览会万次以上。此外，还通过其他方式，如现场会、“亮宝会”、科学晚会、画廊、广播以及黑板报等等，广泛地进行了普及宣传，并在全省业余学校中开设了科学技术课。还协同有关部门在人民公社、厂矿、企业、机关举办短期技术训练班一千二百六十二所，大量地培养了科学技术人才。例如，在积肥运动中三原城关公社科学技术协会小组办的化学肥料厂，仅几天工夫试制成功了二十多种化肥，对生产起了很大作用。安康各地科学技术协会，根据山区的特点开设的各种工厂，提炼出了各种稀有金属，利用野生植物制出了各种新产品，有力地支援了国家建设，同时对改变山区面貌，也发挥了作用。
    各地科学技术协会注意组织知识分子和工农群众相结合，共同进行科学研究活动，已经有了不少可喜的成就。西北农学院教授朱天祜与农民“活鲁班”刘恒杰合作创造了小型畜力割麦机，在全国农具评比会议上获得特等奖，在广泛的推动技术革新运动中起了良好的作用。
    随着广大群众文化知识水平的提高，各地科学技术协会在总结群众生产经验的基础上，大量地出版了科学技术宣传资料。省科学技术协会出版的科学通俗书籍、科学活页资料已达四百九十一种三百八十余万份。绝大部分专区、县市科学技术协会也出版了通俗读物。其中包括定期的科学技术报刊和不定期的宣传小册子等。这些宣传资料短小精悍、通俗易懂，很受广大群众欢迎，成为广大群众用来指导生产的有力工具。
