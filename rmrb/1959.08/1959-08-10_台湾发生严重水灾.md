　　Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 9th. The most serious flooding in over 50 years occurred in central Taiwan on the 8th. Many villages and farmlands along hundreds of miles of Taiwan's west coast, from Miaoli to Chiayi, were flooded, and disaster victims everywhere fled to higher ground. By the evening of the 8th, railway, highway, and telephone connections between Taipei and the flood-stricken areas were completely cut off. Some of the Taiwan Power Company's power plants in Taichung were flooded, resulting in a 25% reduction in the island's power supply. In Taichung County alone, initial reports indicate that more than 100 people have drowned and more than 100 are missing.

　　The Taiwan Meteorological Bureau said that Taichung's rainfall reached eleven inches in twelve hours on the 8th, causing the flood disaster. It is reported that the disrepair of dikes and water conservancy projects in various parts of Taiwan over the years is also an important reason for the severity of this flood disaster.

    台湾发生严重水灾
    新华社9日讯　台北消息：台湾中部8日发生五十多年来最严重的一次水灾。台湾西海岸从苗栗到嘉义几百里地带的许多村庄和农田都被淹，各地灾民纷纷向高地避难。8日傍晚，台北市和水灾区之间的铁路、公路和电话联系都已完全中断。台湾电力公司在台中的发电厂有一些已经被淹，全岛电力供应因而减少了25％。仅在台中县，初步已经知道的有一百多人被淹死，另外一百多人失踪。
    台湾气象局说，台中在8日的十二小时内降雨量达到十一英寸，因而造成了这次洪水灾害。据悉，台湾各地的堤坝和水利工程年久失修，也是造成这次水灾灾情严重的重要原因。
