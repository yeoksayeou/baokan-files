Achievements of the Romanian Oil and Oil Equipment Industry
Dimitrie Răchită, Secretary General of the Romanian Ministry of Heavy Industry

August 23, 1959, marks the fifteenth anniversary of Romania's liberation from fascist enslavement. This is a historic day for the Romanian people and a great national festival, because Romania is no longer regarded by other nations as an economically backward country whose main foreign trade commodities are crude oil, salt, timber, and grain. Over the past fifteen years, Romania has gradually come to be seen as a rapidly industrializing country building and developing a strong heavy industry based on its abundant resources. Romania's heavy industry plan focuses on the establishment and development of the oil industry and a modern oil equipment industry.

If people have not forgotten the level at which the Romanian oil industry started and the conditions inherited by the people's democratic regime from the former bourgeois landlord regime, they will believe that Romania has indeed made a great leap forward in terms of modern oil industry and its new technology.

Although Romania's oil industry is one of the oldest in the world (with a history of more than 100 years), during the bourgeois landlord regime, the Romanian oil industry was characterized by: using old methods to extract and refine crude oil, lagging behind the world level at that time.

In the past, most of the oil exported by Romania was crude oil or roughly processed petroleum by-products, so for imperialism, Romania was a raw material reserve.

In the past, the backwardness of the Romanian oil industry was also reflected in the following fact: Although Romania was a huge oil-producing country, it did not have its own oil equipment industry. The equipment, devices, and materials needed by the oil industry had to be imported from the United States and Germany. In Romania, there were only a few repair shops belonging to foreign companies near large-scale oil extraction sites, manufacturing some parts to maintain the use of the machines.

In order to re-establish and develop Romania's national economy, as early as the autumn of 1945, the Party pointed out the necessity of developing the oil industry at the National Assembly. In 1945, Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said at the National Congress of the Communist Party: "We must strengthen the exploration and extraction of new oil fields to increase the current oil production. Oil is not only a fuel for industry, transportation, and agriculture, but it is also our most important export commodity. The oil industry is extremely important."

Following the above instructions, the oil industry workers worked selflessly, restored the use of abandoned old oil wells, repaired the oil refineries destroyed by the war, and created favorable conditions for a new period of oil industry development. They ignored the will and orders of capitalists and foreign trusts. Nevertheless, because most of the oil enterprises still belonged to capitalists, the reconstruction of the oil industry proceeded very slowly. The reduction of oil production stopped, but there was no increase in production. The American and British trusts, which accounted for 90% of Romania's oil production, implemented a series of measures aimed at hindering the revitalization of the oil industry and sabotaging the Romanian oil industry, such as: reducing the drilling of oil wells, refusing to import new equipment from overseas, refusing to modernize oil refineries, and stopping the drilling of new oil wells.

Therefore, it was necessary to take fundamental measures to ensure the development of the Romanian oil industry. This was impossible under the capitalist system. Only the nationalization of Romanian oil in June 1948 achieved this goal.

1948, the nationalization of the main means of production, marked a meaningful day in the development history of the Romanian oil industry, and also marked the improvement of the technical level of the Romanian oil industry and the establishment and development of the oil equipment industry.

After June 1948, through a series of measures such as concentrating production in large enterprises, establishing new oil plants, equipping old oil plants with the latest machines, organizing several research institutions and design units, and training a large number of cadres, the entire oil industry began to be reorganized and expanded on the basis of modern technology.

Our Party and government, based on the international socialist division of labor among socialist countries, prioritized the development of industries with abundant raw materials in their own country, and paid attention to the experience of cadres, so they paid great attention to the development of the oil industry and made huge investments in the oil industry every year. The investment figures in the oil industry account for 25% to 30% of the total industrial investment figures.

It must be pointed out that the allocation of investment does not focus on immediate interests, but aims to promote the average development of all sectors of the oil industry, especially focusing on oil drilling, which was neglected during the capitalist system.

Thanks to the efforts made in deep drilling, extremely promising new oil fields have been discovered near old oil fields (such as the Monresti-Tazlau area, where the new oil fields have made a great contribution to the increase in oil production). Two new oil areas—Piteshti and Oltenia—currently produce half of the country's total crude oil output. The new oil wells drilled in Maramures, northern Romania, began to produce the first batch of crude oil a few years ago. Recent drilling shows that there are abundant oil-producing areas in the Romanian plains (Danube Plain) and the Pannonian Basin (Bana area).

On the basis of deep drilling, the drilling of oil wells, especially exploratory drilling, has been greatly developed. The state has made huge investments in the oil industry. In 1957, exploratory drilling increased five times compared with 1948, and extractive drilling increased two times.

In order to refine the increasing amount of crude oil and improve the refining degree of petroleum products, the existing production capacity of oil refineries has been expanded, and new oil refineries (such as the Eighth and Tenth Oil Refineries in Moldavia) and new fractionation plants have been established.

The production capacity created during the People's Democratic regime and other measures to develop the oil industry have led to a rapid increase in oil production.

In 1958, crude oil extraction reached 11.36 million tons, and marsh gas reached 5.075 million cubic meters, while in 1948, oil was only 4.14 million tons, and marsh gas was only 1.265 million cubic meters.

While implementing investment plans and striving to increase oil production, Romanian oil workers have launched large-scale technological innovations in all aspects of the oil industry, such as deep exploration and oil refining, adopted modern and highly productive machines and advanced technical methods, and the most modern scientific and technological achievements.

As early as 1950, the Romanian oil industry adopted some of the latest instruments. From 1952 to 1955, geological maps and geophysical maps of the entire territory of Romania were drawn in geological surveys. In the research of geophysics and planned geology, Romanian researchers used the latest instruments, most of which were imported from the Soviet Union.

Romania is one of the first countries in the world to utilize radioactive isotopes in the oil industry. At the same time, Romania is also one of the first countries to send materials on the use of radioactive isotopes in oil extraction to the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva.

Important progress has also been made in oil well drilling and other aspects of the oil industry, due to the use of the latest and highly productive technologies, such as turbine drilling, rapid drilling, and chemical analysis and experiments on crude oil liquids in laboratories and research institutions, the application of collective drilling, and the increased application of electricity in most oil fields, etc.

Important achievements have also been made in the technical process of crude oil refining. Now all the crude oil extracted in Romania is refined domestically. Not only that, but the refining degree of crude oil has also been greatly increased, which is the result of the establishment of several new factories and the application of the latest technical methods. Now, Romania's own oil refineries produce various valuable petroleum products and by-products.

All this proves how Romanian oil workers have relentlessly and skillfully utilized the century-old experience of the oil industry. However, it cannot be ignored that the large-scale research work carried out in research institutions, colleges, and laboratories since the establishment of the People's Democratic regime and the training of cadres have greatly enriched the experience of the oil industry.

Thanks to the care of the Party and the government, a modern oil equipment industry has been established on the basis of the former repair shops.

In the past fifteen years of the People's regime, in order to meet the growing needs of domestic industry and the increasing exports, some factories in Romania, such as the "May 1st" Factory and the "Mao Zedong" Factory, have begun to manufacture oil equipment.

It must be pointed out that while developing the oil industry, our builders have paid extreme attention to expanding the domestic production of oil equipment parts and gradually improving the technical level of production.

In the early post-war period (1944-1951), many oil equipment were manufactured temporarily. After the establishment of the Soviet-Romanian Oil Equipment Company in 1951, the oil equipment industry has had a new and powerful development. The Second Congress of the Romanian Workers' Party held in 1955, based on a comprehensive scientific study of Romanian industry, pointed out the need to adopt the world's latest technological achievements in industry, and pointed out the necessity and ways of manufacturing machines and equipment with high production capacity. Since 1955, oil industrial equipment has begun to be produced in large quantities.

An important achievement of our oil equipment manufacturing industry is: In 1957, shortly after the "Heavy Machinery Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute" made the design, the "May 1st" Factory in Ploshti carried out the large-scale production of the 4LD-150 drilling rig. This drilling rig has a load capacity of 150 tons, a power of 1,400 horsepower, a drilling depth of 3,200 meters, and a maximum oil output of 21 tons. In 1958, the "May 1st" Factory produced the T-75 drilling rig according to the design made by the same research institute. This drilling rig has a power of 1,400 horsepower, a maximum load of 75 tons, and a drilling depth of 1,800 meters. This drilling rig is movable, fully gas-operated, and can also be equipped with a hydraulic converter. It should be pointed out that these two drilling rigs have reached the latest technical level in the world. During this same period, in addition to the above-mentioned drilling rigs, other most modern oil equipment were also produced. The modernization of oil equipment is of great significance, which is to increase the economic benefits of oil production. For example, in recent years, because my country's oil industry has obtained the most modern drilling rigs produced by the domestic machine manufacturing industry, the speed of oil drilling has greatly developed, and 800 million lei (Romanian currency) has been saved in the past five years due to reduced production costs.

In addition to drilling equipment, our oil equipment manufacturing factories have begun to produce complete sets of machines and equipment for oil refineries. Before the war, complete sets of equipment for oil refineries were purchased from abroad, but in the years of the People's regime, thanks to the efforts of researchers, the difficulties related to the manufacture of this equipment have been resolved. Now, our industry is already producing large-diameter oil refining pipes, liquid separators, thermal regulators, oil refining furnaces, filters, pumps, and other oil equipment accessories.

While expanding the production of oil equipment in many ways, our oil equipment manufacturing factories are committed to increasing the production volume of equipment by improving the technical level and modernization of production. It not only fully guarantees domestic needs, but also creates important conditions for expanding exports. The production volume of oil equipment increased more than three times from 1950 to 1958. The increase in certain types of equipment has even exceeded this number. The state plan for 1959 stipulates that this year, my country's machine manufacturing industry must produce 40% more complete sets of drilling equipment and nearly five times more process equipment for processing crude oil than in 1958.

Our oil equipment is exported to the Soviet Union, China, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, India, France, and Argentina, etc.

The high-quality oil equipment manufactured by our country not only attracts an increasing number of buyers, but also attracts an increasing number of orders. For example, compared with 1955, my country's exports of oil equipment increased more than six times in 1958. And this year, the demand for oil equipment has doubled compared with 1958. An important order that will be handed over by my country's machine manufacturing industry in the short term is to build an oil refinery with an annual output of 750,000 tons of oil in Assam, India. The Romanian People's Republic not only exports oil equipment and provides technical information to India, but also trains Indian experts.

The meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance held in Tirana this year, taking into account the achievements made by the Romanian People's Republic in the oil industry and the favorable conditions that it has so far possessed, adopted a resolution. The resolution stipulates that the Soviet Union and Romania should develop the production of equipment for oil drilling, refining crude oil, and petrochemicals. To achieve these tasks, we should reduce production costs, expand production, improve technical levels, and improve the manufacturing quality of equipment and machines to ensure that we meet the needs of all socialist countries—member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance—for oil equipment.

According to the economic agreements and protocols signed between our country and various socialist countries for 1960-1965, Romania will export a large amount of important oil equipment to socialist countries. This has further advanced the development of economic relations between socialist countries and the socialist international division of labor between socialist countries.

The above-mentioned facts show that now, our oil equipment industry is a fully developed industry, it has the most modern specialized factories, designers, experienced experts, etc. This not only ensures the necessary quality of oil equipment, but also meets domestic and foreign needs.

The continuous development of the oil and oil equipment industry since the establishment of the People's regime is the result of the tireless efforts of oil workers, technicians, and engineers. The Soviet Union has given great help in the development of our oil industry. We have obtained many important oil equipment from the Soviet Union: complete sets of drilling rigs, machines for refining crude oil, compressors, oil pipelines, etc. In addition, the reference materials on the oil industry and the help of Soviet experts provided by the Soviet Union have made a great contribution to laying the foundation for the development of our oil industry.

Thanks to the various efforts made previously and the all-round assistance from the Soviet Union, our country now has a strong and brand-new oil and oil equipment industry.

The most urgent tasks of our oil equipment and oil industry at present are: While increasing production, we should further continue to adopt advanced technologies, so that our achievements in this regard will reach the world's best technical level, and at the same time, we can make contributions to the peaceful competition of the two economic systems in which the socialist camp will eventually defeat the capitalist camp.

    罗马尼亚石油和石油设备工业的成就
    罗马尼亚重工业部秘书长　季米特里·拉查尔
    1959年8月23日是罗马尼亚从法西斯奴役下解放的十五周年纪念日。这是罗马尼亚人民的一个历史纪念日，也是一个全民的伟大节日，因为从此罗马尼亚不再被世界上别的民族当作以原油、盐、木材、谷物为主要对外贸易商品而在经济上居于落后地位的国家。十五年来，罗马尼亚已经逐渐被认为是一个在自己的丰富资源基础上迅速工业化的国家，一个正在建立和发展强大的重工业的国家。罗马尼亚的重工业计划侧重石油工业和现代化的石油设备工业的建立和发展。
    如果人们没有忘记罗马尼亚石油工业开始时的水平和人民民主政权从昔日资产阶级地主政权所继承的条件，就会认为罗马尼亚在现代化石油工业及其新式技术方面确是大跃进。
    尽管罗马尼亚的石油工业居于世界上最老的石油工业之列（已有一百多年的历史），但是在资产阶级地主政权时期，罗马尼亚的石油工业的特点是；用古老的方法开采和提炼原油，落后于当时的世界水平。
    在过去，罗马尼亚出口的石油，大部分是原油或粗制的石油副产品，所以对帝国主义说来，罗马尼亚是一个原料储藏地。
    在过去，罗马尼亚石油工业的落后也表现在下列事实：虽然罗马尼亚是一个巨大的产油国家，可是它并没有自己的石油设备工业。石油工业所需要的设备、装置、物资必须从美国和德国进口。在罗马尼亚，只有在大规模的石油开采地附近有几所属于外国公司的修理厂，制造一些零件以维持机器的使用。
    为了重新建立和发展罗马尼亚的国民经济，早在1945年秋季，在全国代表会议上，党就指出发展石油工业的必要。1945年，乔治乌—德治同志在共产党全国代表大会上说：“必须加强新油田的勘探和开采的工作以提高目前的石油产量。石油不仅是工业、运输、农业的一种燃料，它也是我们的最重要的出口商品。石油工业是极端重要的。”
    石油工业工人遵照上项指示忘我地工作，恢复了废弃的旧油井的使用，修复了被战争破坏的炼油厂，开创了石油工业发展新时期的有利条件。他们对资本家和外国托拉斯的意志和命令置之不理。尽管如此，由于大部分石油企业仍然属于资本家，石油工业的重建工作进行得十分缓慢。石油减产停止了，但是并没有增产。而占有罗马尼亚石油产量90％的美、英托拉斯实施了一系列旨在阻挠石油工业复兴的措施，来破坏罗马尼亚的石油工业，例如：减少油井的钻进，拒绝从海外运入新式设备，拒绝使炼油厂现代化，停止新油井的钻探。
    因此有必要采取根本措施来保证罗马尼亚石油工业的发展。在资本主义制度之下这是办不到的。1948年6月罗马尼亚石油国有化，才实现了这个目的。
    1948年，主要生产手段的国有化，标志着罗马尼亚石油工业发展史上一个有意义的日子，也标志着罗马尼亚石油工业技术水平的提高与石油设备工业的建立和发展。
    1948年6月以后，通过大企业集中生产，建立新油厂，用最新式机器装配旧油厂，组织若干研究机构和设计单位，训练大量干部等一系列措施，整个石油工业开始改组并且开始在现代技术基础上扩建。
    我们的党和政府，基于社会主义国家之间进行国际的社会主义分工，优先发展本国拥有丰富的原料的工业，并注意到干部的经验，因此极注意石油工业的发展，每年向石油工业进行巨额投资。石油工业方面的投资数字，占全部工业投资数字的25％至30％。
    必须指出，投资的分配并不着眼于眼前利益，其目的在促进石油工业各部门的平均发展，尤其侧重于资本主义制度时期所忽视的石油钻探。
    由于在深钻方面所作的努力，在旧油田附近发现了极有希望的新油田（例如蒙列斯提—塔兹劳区，那里新油田对石油产量的增加极有贡献）。两个新油区——彼特什蒂与奥尔特尼亚，目前的原油产量为全国产量的一半。在罗马尼亚北部马拉穆尔所开凿的新油井，几年以前就开始生产首批原油。最近的钻探显示出，在罗马尼亚平地（多瑙河平原）和潘诺尼克盆地（巴纳区）都有丰富的产油区。
    在深钻的基础上，石油井的钻进，尤其是勘探性的钻探，有了很大的发展。国家向石油工业进行了巨额投资。1957年，勘探性的钻井比1948年增五倍，开采性的钻井增二倍。
    为了提炼日益增加的原油，提高石油产品的精炼度，炼油厂的现有生产能力已经扩大，并建立了新的炼油厂（例如在摩尔达维亚的第八号和第十号炼油厂）和新的分馏厂。
    人民民主政权时期所创造的生产能力以及发展石油工业的其他措施，使石油产量迅速增加。
    1958年原油开采量达一千一百三十六万吨，沼气达五百零七万五千立方米，而1948年油仅四百一十四万吨，沼气仅一百二十六万五千立方米。
    在实现投资计划、争取提高石油产量的同时，罗马尼亚石油工人在石油工业各方面，例如深勘、炼油等展开了大规模的技术革新，采用了现代化的、生产能力强大的机器和先进的技术方法，以及最现代化的科学技术成就。
    早在1950年，罗马尼亚石油工业就采用了一些最新式的仪器。1952年至1955年在地质调查方面，绘制了罗马尼亚全境的地质图与地球物理图。在地球物理与计划地质的研究方面，罗马尼亚的研究工作者使用了最新式的仪器，其中大部分是从苏联输入的。
    罗马尼亚是世界上首先在石油工业上利用放射性同位元素的国家之一。同时，罗马尼亚也是最先向在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议第二届大会送致有关在石油开采中利用放射性同位元素的材料的国家之一。
    在油井钻进及石油工业其他方面，也取得了重要的进展，这是因为使用了最新式的、具有高度生产能力的技术，例如，涡轮钻井、快速钻井以及在实验室与研究机构中对原油液体的化学分析及实验，集体钻井的应用，在大多数油田里加强应用电力等等。
    在原油提炼技术过程中也有了重要的成就。现在罗马尼亚开采出来的原油全部在本国提炼。不仅如此，原油的提炼度也有了很大的增加，这是若干新式工厂的建立和最新式技术方法的应用所产生的结果。现在，罗马尼亚自己的炼油厂生产各种有价值的石油产品和副产品。
    所有这一切证明罗马尼亚石油工人如何不屈不挠和巧妙地利用了百年以来的石油工业经验。但是，不容忽略的是人民民主政权成立以来，在研究机构、学院、实验室中进行的大规模的研究工作，对干部的培养，大大地丰富了石油工业的经验。
    由于党和政府的关怀，在昔日修理厂的基础上，建立了现代化的石油设备工业。
    在人民政权的过去十五年中，为了满足日益增涨的国内工业的需要以及逐渐增多的出口的需要，罗马尼亚的一些工厂，例如“五一”工厂、“毛泽东”工厂等等都开始制造石油设备。
    必须指出，在发展石油工业的同时，我们的建设者极端注意扩大国内的石油设备配件的生产和逐步提高生产的技术水平。
    战后初期（1944—1951）许多石油设备都是临时制造的。1951年，苏联—罗马尼亚石油设备公司成立以后，石油设备工业有了新的、有力的发展。1955年举行的罗马尼亚工人党第二次代表大会，以对罗马尼亚工业的全盘科学研究为基础，指出有必要在工业中采用世界最新的技术成就，并且指出制造具有高度生产能力的机器、设备的必要及其途径。从1955年起，石油工业设备开始大量生产。
    我们石油设备制造工业的一项重要成就是：1957年，在“重型机器制造和工艺学研究院”刚作出设计不久，普罗斯蒂的“五一”工厂就进行了4LD—150钻探机的大规模生产。这种钻探机的负荷量一百五十吨，功率一千四百马力，钻探深度三千二百米，最大出油量二十一吨。1958年“五一”工厂根据同一研究院作出的设计，生产了T—75钻探机。这种钻探机的功率一千四百马力，最大负荷七十五吨，钻探深度一千八百米，这种钻探机是能移动的，完全是用气体操纵，同时它也可配备有水力变流器。应该指出的是，这两种钻探机达到世界最新技术水平。在这同一时期，除上述钻探机外，还生产了其他最现代化的石油设备。石油设备的现代化有着重大的意义，这就是增加了石油生产的经济效果。例如，最近几年由于我国的石油工业得到了由本国机器制造工业所生产的最现代化的钻探机，因此石油钻探速度有了很大的发展，而在最近五年内由于减少生产费用节约了八亿列伊（罗币）。
    除了钻探设备外，我国石油设备制造工厂已开始生产炼油厂的全套机器和设备了。在战前，炼油厂的全套设备是向国外购买的，但在人民政权的年代，由于研究人员的努力，有关制造这种设备的困难都被解决了。现在，我国工业已经在生产大口径的炼油管、液体分离器、热力调整器、炼油炉、过滤器、抽水机以及其他石油设备的附件。
    在多方面地扩大石油设备的生产的同时，由于提高了生产的技术水平和现代化程度，我们的石油设备制造工厂就致力于增加设备的生产量。它不仅完全保证了国内的需要，也为扩大出口创造了重要的条件。石油设备的生产量从1950年到1958年，共增加了三倍多。而某些品种的设备的增加还超过这个数字。1959年国家计划规定，今年我国的机器制造工业必须比1958年要多生产40％的全套钻探设备，多生产将近五倍多的处理原油的工艺设备。
    我们的石油设备出口到苏联、中国、波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、保加利亚、印度、法国和阿根廷等国。
    我国制造的优质的石油设备不仅吸引了不断增多的买主，而且也吸引了日益增加的订货。举例说，以1958年与1955年相比，我国出口的石油设备增加了六倍多。而今年石油设备的需要量又比1958年增加一倍。一项将由我国机器制造工业在短期内交出的重要订货是，为印度阿萨姆邦建立一座年产七十五万吨石油的炼油厂。罗马尼亚人民共和国不仅向印度输出石油设备，提供技术资料，而且还训练印度专家。
    今年在地拉那举行的经济互助委员会会议，考虑到罗马尼亚人民共和国在石油工业方面所取得的成就，以及直到目前为止所具备的一些有利条件，所以通过一项决议。决议规定，由苏联和罗马尼亚发展生产石油钻探、提炼原油和石油化学等设备。要实现这些任务，我们就应减低生产费用、扩大生产、提高技术水平以及改进设备和机器的制造质量，以保证满足各社会主义国家——经济互助委员会成员国——对石油设备的需要。
    根据我国同各社会主义国家签订的1960—1965年的经济协定和议定书，罗马尼亚将向社会主义国家输出大量重要的石油设备。而这就使得在发展社会主义国家之间的经济关系，以及在发展社会主义国家之间的社会主义国际分工方面，更进了一步。
    以上所述的一些事实说明，现在，我国的石油设备工业已是一个全面发展的工业，它拥有最现代化的专门工厂、设计师、有经验的专家等等。这就不仅保证了石油设备的必要质量，而且也满足了国内外的需要。
    人民政权成立以来石油和石油设备工业的不断发展，是石油工人、技术员、工程师不倦的努力的结果。在我们石油工业的发展中，苏联给予了很大的帮助。我们从苏联得到了许多重要的石油设备：全套的钻探机、提炼原油的机器、压缩器、输油管等等。此外，苏联向我国提供的有关石油工业的参考资料和苏联专家的帮助，对奠定发展我国石油工业的基础作出了巨大的贡献。
    由于前此所作的种种努力和苏联对我国多方面的援助，我国目前已有一个强大的、全新的石油和石油设备工业。
    我国石油设备和石油工业目前最紧迫的任务是：应该在增加产量的同时，进一步继续采用先进技术，从而使我们在这方面所取得的成就将达到世界最优秀的技术水平，同时也可以使我国在社会主义阵营终将战胜资本主义阵营的、两种经济制度的和平竞赛中作出贡献。（附图片）
