　　Long-Awaited Rain Brings Joy
　　Hunan and Guangxi Rush to Plant Late Autumn Crops

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 13th – Hunan Province has recently experienced widespread and welcome rainfall. The vast numbers of cadres and the masses are seizing this opportunity after the rain, working day and night to store and conserve water, and rush to plant late autumn crops.

In July, Hunan Province basically saw no rain, and Party committees at all levels organized the people to wage a tenacious struggle against the drought. In early August, rainfall occurred in various places, generally ranging from 20 to 60 millimeters, with only six counties and cities receiving less than 20 millimeters; over 20 counties and cities received more than 60 millimeters. Rejoicing in the rain after a long drought, Party committees at all levels have taken emergency measures to organize the masses to vigorously store and conserve water and rush to plant. In Hengyang County, more than 67,000 people were mobilized after the rain to check and repair fields for leaks, close dams, dig ditches, and divert water into ponds, enhancing the drought resistance capacity of nearly 310,000 mu of paddy fields in the county by ten to twenty days.

In the struggle against drought, all localities have tried every possible means to expand the area sown with autumn crops, and the progress of autumn planting has accelerated after the rain. According to statistics from Hengyang, Chenxian, Changsha, and other counties and cities, 2,484,700 mu of autumn miscellaneous crops have been planted, accounting for 44% of the original plan.

While taking advantage of the post-rain opportunity to rush transplant and sow late autumn crops, Hunan Province has also mobilized the people in areas that have not been affected by drought or have been less severely affected to vigorously carry out movements to exceed production targets; and mobilized the people in areas more severely affected by drought to further strengthen their confidence in the idea that man will conquer nature, and to do a good job in production for self-salvation.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 13th – From August 1st to 10th, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region experienced widespread and welcome rainfall, with an average total rainfall of 115 millimeters. Thirty-five counties, including Shanglin, Bobai, and Donglan, received over 100 millimeters of rainfall. The drought situation has been alleviated in more than 700,000 mu of farmland in thirty counties that were previously experiencing water shortages.

All localities are seizing the opportunity after the rain to rush to transplant and sow crops. The entire autonomous region has been transplanting an average of about 600,000 mu of late rice per day in recent days, and by the 10th, 89% of the late rice transplanting plan has been completed. In Laibin County, where more than 100,000 mu were affected by drought, the whole county mobilized manpower to divert water to irrigate fields as soon as there was a shower. Two hundred and twenty-four mountain ponds and reservoirs were quickly filled with water. By August 6th, all 292,000 mu of late rice planned to be planted in the county had been transplanted. Party committee secretaries at all levels in Yishan County took the lead, leading cadres and commune members to divert water to irrigate fields and rush to plow and harrow in the rain. Cadres and commune members of the Sancha People's Commune rushed to plow and harrow 10,000 mu of late rice fields in the rain in one day. On the afternoon of August 2nd, after it rained, the third production team of the Putao People's Commune in Yangshuo County immediately rushed to plant sweet potatoes that night, with all forty members of the team planting 30 mu of sweet potatoes in just three hours.
