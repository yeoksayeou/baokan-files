　　Large Quantities of Seeds Support Hubei
　　Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hunan, and the municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai have recently transferred large quantities of seeds to support farmers in Hubei Province, who are fighting drought to rush-plant autumn coarse grain crops.
　　The total amount of autumn coarse grain seeds allocated is 9.5 million jin. After determining their tasks, all provinces and cities immediately freed up seeds, arranged manpower and transportation, and transported them quickly. After receiving the large quantities of seeds supported by fraternal provinces and cities, the vast number of farmers in Hubei Province have become increasingly confident and determined to overcome the drought and complete the rush-planting of late autumn crops.
　　Shandong Fishermen Set Sail Early
　　Workers in aquatic product departments and the vast number of fishermen in various parts of Shandong Province have broken with convention, shortened their rest time, and set sail to fish half a month earlier than in previous years. They are determined to fight hard in August and September and turn the off-season into a peak season. Currently, more than 9,000 fishing boats and 114 fishing vessels have set out to sea throughout the province. A high tide of fall fishing production has already formed in coastal areas.
　　Qinghai Motorized Sailboats Test Sail
　　Qinghai Province's first batch of motorized sailboats recently launched on Qinghai Lake and test sailed to Haixin Mountain in the lake, proving the boats' performance was good.
　　Qinghai Lake produces a large amount of *Gymnodiptychus ptychocheilus* (湟鱼). In the past, due to limitations in equipment such as boats, people could not go to deep water to fish in the summer and could only wait until the lake froze in winter to drill holes in the ice and fish. In order to fish in deep water and further investigate the resources of Qinghai Lake, the Aquatic Products Bureau of the Provincial Department of Commerce specially invited technicians from the Lüda Shipbuilding Factory of Liaoning Province to Qinghai to help build motorized sailboats and help train workers to operate them.
　　Hu County Discovers Large Quantities of Wild Medicinal Materials
　　The Zhongnan Mountains in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, contain a large amount of wild medicinal materials. The main ones include *Codonopsis pilosula*, *Astragalus membranaceus*, *Notopterygium incisum*, *Paeonia suffruticosa*, *Asparagus officinalis*, *Fritillaria cirrhosa*, *Paeonia lactiflora* and other thirty-two kinds, with an estimated minimum annual output of more than 940,000 jin. At present, Hu County has transferred manpower to form a specialized medicinal herb collection team to enter the mountains to collect herbs.
