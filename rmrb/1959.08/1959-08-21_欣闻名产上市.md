　　Delighted to Hear of Famous Products Entering the Market
　　Xie Yi
    Reports in the newspaper say that many "famous products" are successively entering the market, such as "Sanshenglu" kitchen knives from Harbin, Liuyang summer cloth from Hunan, Qianxi wheat straw fans from Jinhua, Zhejiang, and bamboo mats from Baoluan, Sichuan, and so on.
    In my opinion, the first reason these are called "famous products" is because they satisfy the needs of the people's lives, and are loved and readily used by the people. For example, the bamboo mats from Baoluan, Sichuan, are woven from cold bamboo from the mountains that has endured wind and frost for a long time and is soft but not brittle, weighing only one-sixth as much as ordinary bamboo mats. If you are traveling elsewhere, you can fold it up like cotton cloth, roll it up, and take it on the train, which is very convenient. Secondly, because it is the valuable experience of the working people, with high technical achievements. Our ancestors, without knowing how much sweat they shed, how much effort they spent, and how many times they failed, achieved such experience and accomplishments. For example, the "Sanshenglu" kitchen knife has evenly distributed steel on the blade, strong wear resistance, can maintain sharpness for a long time, does not show concave-convex phenomena, and does not chip or curl when cutting hard things. This is the reason why it has become a "famous product".
    The listing of the "Sanshenglu" kitchen knife reminds me of Yang Zhi's knife in "Water Margin," which "cuts hair blown against it." From these four words, one can imagine its sharpness. Although these are all descriptions in literary works, if there was no high level of smelting at that time, people would not have been able to imagine it out of thin air. This shows that our ancestors, through arduous labor, created a considerable level of production technology and relatively rich scientific knowledge. Some of the treasures left by our ancestors have already been unearthed, such as acupuncture in medicine, prescriptions for treating leprosy and high blood pressure, curing appendicitis without surgery, etc. It has already begun to gradually reduce many of the people's sufferings and benefit mankind. But there are still many treasures that have not been unearthed. For example, in the countryside, there is a popular medicine that, when applied to a gunshot wound, can draw out the bullet embedded in the flesh without surgery. There are many more like this, which urgently need us to vigorously unearth.
    However, not everything from the predecessors is good or complete. Because the production level in the past was lower than it is now, and there were great limitations, some things may no longer be suitable for use now, and some things may be dross rather than essence. Therefore, unearthing the labor achievements of our ancestors requires a "removing the crude and retaining the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true" effort. Otherwise, losing the essence and grasping the dross will still not benefit the people today.
    Excavating heritage is not just about imitating, but about summarizing, improving, and continuing to develop. Learning from the experiences of predecessors and others is necessary, but not to take over their brand name "to attract customers." For example, scissors, there is "Wang Mazi" in Beijing, "Zhang Mazi" in Kaifeng, and there used to be "Wu Mazi" in Guilin, and there may be other Li Mazis and the like in other places. The name "Mazi" is not unusable, but it is not necessary to use it. If the goods are genuine, they will be equally popular with the people even if they are not called "Mazi." For example, Xiang embroidery and Hang embroidery, Xinhui palm fans from Guangdong, and wheat straw fans from Jinhua, Zhejiang, each have their own characteristics and are equally loved by the people. Therefore, inheriting the heritage of our ancestors and learning from the advanced experiences of others requires originality and a unique style, not just imitation, so that we can release unique flowers and splendor in the great garden of the motherland.

　　欣闻名产上市
　　谢逸
    报上登载，许多“名产”纷纷上市，如哈尔滨的“三盛炉”菜刀，湖南的浏阳夏布，浙江金华的乾西麦秆扇、四川包鸾的竹席，等等。
    所谓“名产”，我看第一，是由于它满足了人民生活上的需要，为人民所喜爱和乐用。比如四川包鸾的竹席，是用山上久经风霜、质柔不脆的冷竹编成，只有普通竹席六分之一那么重，你要到别处去旅行，可以像棉布似的将它折叠起来，那么一卷，就上火车，十分方便。第二，因为它是劳动人民的宝贵经验，有着高度的技术成就，我们的祖先，不知流了多少汗，花了多少气力，经过多少次失败，才取得这样的经验和成就。如“三盛炉”的菜刀，刀刃上的钢分布均匀，耐磨力强，能长久保持锋利，不出凹凸现象，切硬东西不崩刃不卷刃，这就是它所以成为“名产”的原因。
    从“三盛炉”菜刀的上市，使我想起“水浒”里杨志的那把刀，它“吹毛得过”，从这四个字，就可以想见其锋利的程度。这虽都是文艺作品中的描写，但如果当时没有高度的冶炼水平，人们也不会平空臆想得出来。这就可以说明，我们祖先经过艰苦的劳动，是创造了相当高度的生产技术水平和比较丰富的科学知识的。而我们对祖先遗留下来的宝藏，有些是已经发掘出来了，如医药方面的针灸，治麻疯、高血压的药方，不用开刀治好阑尾炎等等，它已经开始逐步地做到减少人民的许多痛苦，而造福了人类。但也还有许多宝藏没有发掘出来，比如说，乡下盛传有一种药，敷在枪伤的伤口上，不用开刀，可以将嵌在肉内的弹头吸出来。诸如此类，还有很多，急需我们大力发掘。
    但是，前人的东西，不是样样都好、件件皆全的，由于从前的生产水平比现在低，局限性大，有的可能现在已不合用了，有的东西也可能只是糟粕，不是精华。因此，发掘祖先的劳动成果，就必须做一番“去粗取精，去伪存真”的功夫，不然，丢了精华，抓住糟粕，对今天的人民还是没有好处的。
    发掘遗产，也不是一味的模仿，而是加以总结提高，继续发展。学习前人及别人的经验是需要的，但不是去顶人家的牌子，“以广招徕”。比如剪刀，北京有个“王麻子”，开封有个“张麻子”，桂林过去也有个“吴麻子”，其他地方可能也还有什么李麻子之类。“麻子”之名不是不可以用，但也不一定要用，如果货真价实，不叫“麻子”也一样的为人民所乐用，比如湘绣和杭绣、广东新会的葵扇和浙江金华的麦秆扇，就是各有特色，同样的为人民喜爱。因此说，继承祖先遗产和学习别人的先进经验，要有独创性，要有自己的风格，不是一味的模仿，这才可以在祖国的大花园里放出奇花异采。
