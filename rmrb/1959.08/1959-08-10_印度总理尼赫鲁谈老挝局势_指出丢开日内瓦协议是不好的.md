Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th - Indian Prime Minister Nehru, commenting on the situation in Laos, said, "If you discard the Geneva Accords, then in a sense, you are returning to the stage before the Geneva Conference, and that is not good. The approach taken by the Geneva Conference was to free Indochina from the Cold War or hot war."

Nehru made these remarks at a press conference on the 7th, in response to a reporter's question regarding the rejection by the governments of Britain, Canada, and Laos of India's proposal to resume the activities of the International Commission for Laos.

Referring to the news that the United Nations was sending "observers" to Laos, Nehru said, "The main issue is whether or not to tear up the Geneva Accords. Our position there is determined by the Geneva Accords. If the Geneva Accords are torn up, we will pack up and go home." He pointed out that such a step would affect not only Laos but also other countries in Indochina. Nehru said that India participated in this matter because the Geneva Conference designated it as the chairman of the Supervisory and Control Commission. He also said, "We have been emphasizing that the two chairmen (of the Geneva Conference) should adopt the approach of the Geneva Accords." However, he added that an (international) commission cannot be imposed on a country.

    印度总理尼赫鲁谈老挝局势
    指出丢开日内瓦协议是不好的
    新华社新德里7日电　印度总理尼赫鲁在评论老挝局势时说，“如果你丢开日内瓦协议，那末在某种意义上说，也就是回到日内瓦会议以前的阶段，而这是不好的。日内瓦会议所采取的办法是要使印度支那摆脱冷战或热战。”
    尼赫鲁是7日在记者招待会上说这番话的，这番话是为了答复一个记者所提的关于英国、加拿大和老挝三国政府拒绝印度建议恢复老挝国际委员会的活动的问题。
    谈到联合国派遣“视察员”去老挝的消息，尼赫鲁说，“主要问题是，是不是要撕毁日内瓦协议。我们在那里的地位是由日内瓦协议决定的。如果撕毁日内瓦协议，我们就卷铺盖回家。”他指出，这样一个步骤，将不仅关系到老挝，而且也关系到印度支那的其他国家。尼赫鲁说，印度参加这件事是因为日内瓦会议指定它担任监察和监督委员会的主席。他还说，“我们一直在强调（日内瓦会议）两位主席应当采取日内瓦协议的方法。”但是，他又说，不能把一个（国际）委员会强加给一个国家。
