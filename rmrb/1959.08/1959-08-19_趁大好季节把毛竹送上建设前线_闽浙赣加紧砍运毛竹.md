Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 18th: Workers and commune members in the bamboo forest areas of Fujian Province are launching a socialist labor emulation campaign, striving to cut more bamboo in August and September to support construction in various regions.

　　Employees of the Lijiatang logging area in Jianyang County proposed that the plan to cut and transport 300,000 bamboo poles this year should be completed ahead of schedule by the end of September. Currently, they have already cut and transported 230,000 bamboo poles.

　　In order to improve the efficiency of bamboo cutting and transportation, workers have erected high-altitude cableways in deep mountains and dense forests, blasted shoals and opened rivers in mountain streams, and vigorously promoted vehicle transportation on land, adopting a combined transportation method of water, land, and air to continuously transport bamboo out of the deep mountains. The Guannan logging area in Shaxian County has built a new five-mile-long bamboo slide, which only requires thirteen workers to manage and can transport 8,000 bamboo poles per day.

　　By the end of July, Fujian Province had cut down more than 11 million bamboo poles this year, with more than 5 million bamboo poles cut down in June and July alone, and is now being transported in large quantities to various parts of the province and beyond.

　　Fujian Province is one of the main bamboo producing areas in China. At present, basic construction in Anshan and Shanghai, the construction of the Grand Canal in Jiangsu Province, fisheries production in Shandong, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces, and salt production in Sichuan all require Fujian Province to supply bamboo.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 18th: Bamboo-producing areas in Zhejiang Province are carrying out a campaign of rapid cutting and rapid transportation, cutting down large quantities of bamboo and transporting it to all parts of the country.

　　By the end of July, the province had cut down more than 19 million large bamboo poles this year, and more than 14 million had been transported to Beijing, Shanghai, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and other places, as well as key construction sites in Zhejiang Province. In the first half of this year, the province's bamboo purchase and sales volume set a historical record, with purchases increasing by 2.9% and sales increasing by 10.38% compared with the same period last year.

　　Since the spring flood season, farmers in bamboo-producing areas have tried every means to overcome the shortage of labor and transportation difficulties, and continuously transported bamboo out of remote mountainous areas. Communes in mountainous areas such as Qingtian, Lin'an, Longquan, and Lishui counties have generally erected aerial ropeways and bamboo chutes to transport bamboo from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain at once. Communes in Anji County also built dams section by section in mountain streams and released water at each level, using a small amount of water to transport a large amount of bamboo. In July, the county built a total of 120 dams and leveled 30 beaches, transporting 170,000 bamboo poles despite the lack of rainfall.

　　This year, bamboo-producing areas in Zhejiang Province have generally established specialized bamboo cutting and transportation teams, and have also mobilized commune members to seize favorable opportunities and carry out a blitz of cutting and transporting bamboo. Anji County launched a blitz campaign in July, cutting down more than 1.69 million bamboo poles in less than a month, completing 74.3% of the cutting plan for the third quarter; after mobilizing the masses to take various measures, more than 360,000 bamboo poles were quickly transported out of the mountainous area.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 18th: Bamboo producing areas in Jiangxi are seizing the summer and autumn seasons with water to rush the cut bamboo down the mountain, and promptly transfer it out by waterway.

　　At present, nearly 200,000 people have been organized in various bamboo producing areas of the province to rush to transport bamboo up the mountains. They use mountain slopes to build large wooden and bamboo slides, wooden rails, and aerial cableways to rush the bamboo down the mountain and concentrate it on the river bank for transportation. The Gannan Administrative Region organized 80,000 people to stay in the mountains to cut and transport wood and bamboo. Within ten days, more than 7,000 people from Xinfeng, Ganxian, and Shangyou counties alone transported more than 13,000 bamboo poles from the mountains and then transferred them out through small rivers and streams. Suichuan County in the Ji'an Special Zone built a 120-mile-long wooden track, 12 bamboo slides, and a 30-mile-long flatbed track, which doubled the efficiency of bamboo transportation; in terms of water transportation, they achieved "no rafts left in the river, releasing them as soon as they arrive"; as a result, in just seven days, the county transported more than 46,000 cubic meters of bamboo and wood.

　　In order to strengthen the transfer of bamboo, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee jointly convened an emergency telephone conference on the production and transfer of timber and bamboo in early June, requiring all localities to make full use of the summer and autumn seasons with water to speed up the transfer of bamboo, and strive to complete the annual bamboo cutting and transportation plan ahead of schedule. The Provincial People's Committee also established a timber and bamboo transfer command to strengthen leadership.

　　So far, Jiangxi Province has cut down more than 17 million bamboo poles this year, and more than 12 million have passed inspection and are being transported to national timber (bamboo) storage yards and various factory and mining areas.

　　趁大好季节把毛竹送上建设前线
　　闽浙赣加紧砍运毛竹
    新华社福州18日电　福建省各竹林区毛竹砍伐场的工人们和人民公社社员，正在开展社会主义劳动竞赛，力争8、9两月砍伐更多的毛竹，支援各地建设。
    建阳县李家塘砍伐场的职工提出，今年砍伐运出三十万根毛竹的计划，要提前在9月底以前完成，目前，他们已砍伐运出毛竹二十三万根。
    为了提高毛竹砍伐和运输效率，工人们在深山密林里架设高空索道，在山涧溪流里炸滩开河，在陆地上大搞车子运输，采取水、陆、空齐头并进的联运法，把毛竹从深山里源源运出。沙县官南砍伐场新建了一条五里长的竹滑道，只需十三个工人管理，每天可运竹子八千根。
    到7月底为止，福建省今年已砍伐毛竹一千一百多万根，仅6、7两个月就砍伐了五百多万根，现在正在大批运往省外各地。
    福建省是我国毛竹的主要产区之一。目前，鞍山、上海等地的基本建设，江苏省的大运河施工，山东、浙江、辽宁等省的渔业生产以及四川盐业生产，都需要福建省供应毛竹。
    据新华社杭州18日电　浙江省各产竹地区，开展快砍、快运的运动，砍伐大量毛竹运往全国各地。
    到7月底，全省今年已砍伐了一千九百多万根大毛竹，有一千四百多万根已运往北京、上海、西藏、内蒙古等地和浙江省重点建设工地。今年上半年，全省毛竹购销量创造了历史上的最高纪录，和去年同期比较，收购量增加了2.9％，销售量增加10.38％。
    春汛以来，产竹区的农民千方百计地克服了劳力不足和运输上的困难，把毛竹源源运出偏僻山区。青田、临安、龙泉、丽水等县山区各公社，普遍架设了空中索道、竹滑道，使毛竹从山顶一下子运到山脚下。安吉县各公社还在山溪中节节筑坝，逐级放流，利用少量的水，运出大量的毛竹。7月份，全县共筑坝一百二十道、平滩三十个，在雨水并不多的情况下，运出毛竹十七万根。
    今年，浙江省各产竹区普遍建立了毛竹砍伐、运输专业队，还发动社员抓紧有利时机，开展突击砍伐、运输毛竹的运动。安吉县在7月份开展了一次突击运动，不到一个月就砍下毛竹一百六十九万多根，完成了第三季度砍伐计划的74.3％；经过发动群众采取各种办法后，有三十六万多根迅速运出了山区。
    新华社南昌18日电　江西各毛竹产区正抓紧夏、秋有水季节，把砍伐的毛竹抢运下山，及时由水路转运出去。
    现在，全省各毛竹产地已组织近二十万人上山抢运毛竹。他们利用山坡大建木、竹滑道和木轨道、空中索道，把毛竹抢运下山，集中到河边待运。赣南行政区组织了八万人驻在山间砍运木竹，十天内，仅信丰、赣县、上犹三个县上山的七千多人，就把一万三千多根毛竹从山上运下，再由小河小溪转运出去。吉安专区遂川县建设了一百二十里长的木轨道，十二条竹滑道，三十里长的板车道，使运输毛竹的效率提高了二倍；在水运方面，他们做到“河不存筏，随到随放”；结果，仅七天时间，全县就运出竹、木四万六千多立方米。
    为了加强毛竹调运，中共江西省委和江西省人民委员会在6月上旬联合召开了木材和毛竹生产调运紧急电话会议，要求各地充分利用夏秋有水季节，加紧调运毛竹，力争提前完成全年的毛竹砍运计划。省人民委员会还成立了木竹调运指挥部，加强领导。
    到目前为止，江西省今年共砍伐了一千七百多万根毛竹，有一千二百多万根经过检验合格，正在运往国家贮木（竹）场和各地厂矿地区。
