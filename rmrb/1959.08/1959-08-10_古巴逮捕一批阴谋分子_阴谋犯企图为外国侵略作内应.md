Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 8th. According to reports from "Latin American News Agency," Cuban government police arrested hundreds of conspirators last night. These conspirators were former military personnel and police officers from the previous dictatorial regime, as well as members of the "Tiger Squad" led by former Senator Rolando Masferrer, who had fled to Miami, USA. Additionally, among those arrested was Cains Miranes, Chairman of the Livestock Owners Association, who resisted land reform and had sworn "I would rather die than hand over the land." Just as they were plotting to organize a committee attempting to carry out sabotage activities to serve as internal support for an aggression plan from the Dominican Republic, they were discovered by the Cuban Revolutionary Police and the Rebel Army, and a large amount of ammunition and weapons belonging to the conspirators were seized at the same time.
