Guangzhou, August 19th (from our newspaper) – In the East River region of Guangdong Province, Zengcheng, Dongguan, and Boluo, three counties severely affected by disasters, have recently launched a socialist labor competition for late-season crop production in their adjacent areas. They are adopting methods of mutual inspection and comparison to promote advanced experiences and drive the farmers of the three counties to leap forward together, striving to eliminate traces of the disaster after the autumn harvest.

The adjacent areas of the three counties participating in the first evaluation – Shitan Commune in Zengcheng County, Shilong Commune in Dongguan County, and Tiechang Commune in Boluo County – were all heavily disaster-stricken. Under the correct leadership of the Party committees, the people of these three communes put forward the bold slogan of "Seize a year's worth of grain in one season, and strive to eliminate all traces of disaster after autumn harvest." With soaring enthusiasm, they vigorously engaged in late-season crop production. After the flood receded, they immediately started to plug breaches and restore embankments, completing a huge amount of earthwork in a short period. Shitan Commune, with a population of 50,000, plugged more than 100 large breaches and completed more than 370,000 cubic meters of earthwork in just over 20 days. After rapidly completing the plugging of breaches and restoration of embankments, these three communes immediately rushed to plant late-season rice according to the requirements of being fast, plentiful, and good. Shitan Commune expanded its late-season rice acreage from 82,000 mu in the past to 100,000 mu, while Tiechang Commune increased it from 67,000 mu to more than 78,000 mu. Various communes launched high-efficiency rice transplanting campaigns, greatly accelerating the progress of transplanting. By the end of July, Shilong Commune had already overfulfilled its planting task of 43,500 mu of late-season rice. In order to ensure good planting and management, and to guarantee a bumper harvest, all localities implemented a system of managing each plot of land as it was planted, and promptly strengthened field management. At present, a green expanse has already appeared in the vast fields of these three communes.

The Shilong branch of the Foshan Prefectural Committee East River Production Inspection Group, composed of prefectural committee, county committee, commune committee, and relevant brigade cadres, listened to the reports of these three communes and then conducted on-site inspections in the adjacent areas of the three communes, mobilizing commune members to conduct extensive airing of views through big-character posters on current production issues. At the same time, work teams were sent to production teams to hold forums with activists and experienced farmers to solicit opinions from the masses on how to improve late-season crop production. During the inspection, the method of dissecting a sparrow was also adopted to discover problems, create experiences, and guide the overall situation. For example, when inspecting the production situation of the Shishen and Hushan brigades of Tiechang Commune in Boluo, it was discovered that the planted fields were being harmed by rice leaf rollers, rice stem borers, and planthoppers. Xin Daguang, the First Secretary of the Boluo County Party Committee, immediately telephoned to notify the entire county to pay attention to preventing and eliminating insects. The Tiechang Commune Party Committee also immediately held an on-site meeting in these two teams to deploy insect control work, quickly launching an insect control campaign. After the inspection team discovered that the field water was too deep in the Shatian and Tujiang brigades of Shitan Commune in Zengcheng, and that individual plots of land even had rice seedlings dying from being submerged, the Commune Party Committee immediately held a battlefield meeting. Aiming at the ideological concerns of some cadres and the masses who were afraid of drought, they launched a debate, so that each production team consciously formulated a scientific irrigation and drainage plan.

After conducting on-site inspections and carrying out extensive airing of views, Shitan Commune in Zengcheng County was rated as an advanced commune and won the rotating red flag.

The three communes of the three counties also signed a competition contract, and the second evaluation will be held in September.

　　力争在秋后消灭灾痕
　　广东三个重灾县毗连地区展开生产竞赛
    本报广州19日电　广东省东江地区的增城、东莞、博罗三个重灾县，最近在毗连地区开展了晚造生产的社会主义劳动竞赛，采用互相检查评比的办法，推广先进经验，带动三个县的农民共同跃进，力争在秋后消灭灾痕。
    参加第一次评比的三个县的毗连地区——增城县石滩公社、东莞县石龙公社、博罗县铁场公社，都是重灾地区。这三个公社的人民在党委的正确领导下，提出了“一造夺取一年粮，力争秋后无灾痕”的豪迈口号，用冲天干劲，大搞晚造生产。洪水退后，他们就立即进行堵口复堤，在短短期间内完成了巨大数量的土方任务。另有五万人口的石滩公社，仅仅在二十多天之内，就把一百多个大决口堵住，完成了三十七万多个土方。这三个公社在迅速完成堵口复堤以后，又立即按照又快又多又好的要求抢插晚稻。石滩公社把晚稻面积从过去的八万二千亩扩大到十万亩，铁场公社从六万七千亩扩大到七万八千多亩。各社开展了插秧高工效运动，大大加快了插秧进度。石龙公社至7月底，已经超额完成了四万三千五百亩晚稻的栽植任务。为了做到插好管好，确保丰收，各地都实行插一块管一块，及时加强田间管理。目前，这三个公社的大片田野上已经呈现一片油绿。
    由地委、县委、公社党委和有关大队干部组织的佛山地委东江生产检查团石龙分团，在听取了这三个公社的汇报以后，随即在三个公社的毗连地区进行了实地检查，发动社员用大字报的方式就当前生产问题进行大鸣大放。同时，派出工作组深入到生产队召开积极分子和老农座谈会，征询群众对搞好晚造生产的意见。在检查中，还采取解剖麻雀的方法，发现问题，创造经验，指导全面。如在检查博罗铁场公社的石渗、湖山大队生产情况的时候，发现已插的田有稻纵卷叶虫、剃枝虫、浮尘子等为害，博罗县委第一书记辛大光同志立即打电话通知全县及时注意防虫除虫。铁场公社党委也马上在这两个队召开现场会议，布置除虫工作，迅速掀起了除虫运动。检查团在增城石滩公社的沙田、土江大队发现田水过深，个别块田还有浸死禾的现象以后，公社党委立即召开了战地会议，针对部分干部、群众存在着怕受旱的思想顾虑，开展了辩论，使各个生产队都自觉地制订了科学排灌的计划。
    经过实地检查，开展大鸣大放，增城县石滩公社被评为上游公社，夺取了流动红旗。
    这三个县的三个公社并签订了竞赛合同，第二次评比将在9月份举行。
