According to a report in the Dazhong Daily, the Jinan Metallurgical Mining Equipment Factory conscientiously implements the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee. The Party Committee Secretary is more proactive, the factory director's responsibilities are clear, cadres are in a good mood, and workers' enthusiasm is soaring, creating a hotbed of increased production and savings.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, due to the greatly strengthened leadership of the Party in the enterprise and the soaring enthusiasm of all factory workers, the total output value in 1958 reached more than 39 million yuan, equivalent to 249.96% of that in 1957; labor productivity increased by more than 40% compared with 1957.

In order to ensure continued leaps forward this year, further strengthen enterprise management, and earnestly implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee, the factory Party Committee organized Party Committee members and Party Branch secretaries to study relevant Party documents at the beginning of the second quarter of this year, specifically analyzed and checked the implementation of the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee, and took the following actions and measures:

	Improve Collective Leadership and Strengthen the Party's Leadership Core
Since the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the collective leadership system of the Party in this factory has been gradually strengthened, but there are also some shortcomings, mainly reflected in: fewer meetings of the Party Committee as a whole, insufficient in-depth discussion of major issues, and sometimes the secretary personally answered and handled some issues that should have been handled by the administration, and the factory director was unaware. This not only affected the enthusiasm of administrative cadres, but also fostered their thinking of relying on the secretary for everything. In response, they focused on strengthening the core link of the Party's collective leadership, first by reorganizing and improving the Party's primary organizations. On this basis, the factory's Party Committee was elected, and a Standing Committee was elected to preside over the Party's daily work, strengthening the Party's leadership core. Secondly, they conscientiously held meetings of the Party Committee as a whole and meetings of the Standing Committee. Generally, the regulations stipulate that a meeting of the Party Committee as a whole is held once a month, and a meeting of the Standing Committee is held once a week. Branch committees meet once a week, and workshop branch meetings are held once a month. Through these Party meeting activities, they listen to the work reports of Party Committee members, discuss the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines and major issues of the factory, and then make conclusions after full discussion. In this way, they achieved unity of thought and action, and implemented various tasks more quickly and effectively. Third, Party resolutions must be made cautiously, and once decided, they must be resolutely implemented. The Party organization of the factory adheres to the spirit that when problems arise, the deputy secretaries and Standing Committee members first communicate, then separately communicate with other Party Committee members, and finally gather together for deliberation. This ensures mutual communication of information and full preparation, making the resolutions feasible. For some major issues, they not only conduct deliberation among Party Committee members, but also convene relevant comrades from workshop branches and departments to conduct extensive consultation, so that the Party's resolutions have a solid mass base. Fourth, establish and improve intra-Party democratic life and give full play to the backbone role of Party members. Since the second quarter, criticism and self-criticism have been carried out regularly in Party organizations at all levels, advocating the communist style of adhering to the truth and daring to correct mistakes. Starting in May, the "Five Goods of Party Members" movement, which emphasizes good Party spirit, good completion of production tasks, good mass relations, good learning, and good social activities, was launched among all 141 Party members in the factory. In the quality competition movement launched in the second quarter, 84 Party members from the lathe, fitter, forging, riveting, and machine repair workshops, after evaluation and inspection, all guaranteed the quality of their products, and led all workers to launch a quality blitz, so that the quality of all products leaving the factory met the national standards.

    Party Committee Grasps Key Issues, Factory Director Organizes to Achieve Production Plans
Strengthening the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party Committee, what exactly should the Party Committee grasp? How should the factory director responsibility system be implemented? According to the bits and pieces of practical experience of the Mining Equipment Factory in the past few months: the Party Committee should mainly grasp the Party's political and ideological work, conscientiously implement the mass line, fully mobilize the masses, and give full play to the organizational role of the Party, government, trade union, and youth league to ensure the comprehensive completion of the factory's production tasks in each period; the factory director should mainly be responsible for the overall work of the factory in terms of administration based on the major policies and principles determined by the Party Committee, and specifically organize various departments, workshops, and work sections to achieve the factory's production plans in each period on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis.

Since the second quarter, the factory Party Committee has followed this principle, analyzed the situation in a timely manner based on the key issues in the thinking of the factory workers and in production, grasped key issues, and conducted the Party's political and ideological work, pointing out the direction of advancement for all workers in a timely manner. For example, at the beginning of the second quarter, due to the large number of new products and the shortage of raw materials, the workers had feelings of difficulty in completing the production plan. The factory Party Committee conscientiously analyzed this situation, and in accordance with the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee, mobilized all workers to use their brains, think of ways, and do everything possible to overcome difficulties, increase income and reduce expenditure, and strive to complete the tasks. In this way, the enthusiasm of the workers was greatly boosted, and as a result, the total output value in the second quarter completed 104.59% of the plan, and all of the six key products except for winches exceeded the plan, and the specifications and quality were guaranteed.

The workers saw that the plan was completed well, and they developed a feeling of relaxation. At this time, the Party Committee immediately convened a congress of all factory workers, analyzed the favorable conditions for completing the tasks of the third quarter and pointed out the existing difficulties, and timely proposed the fighting goal of "continuing to exert great efforts, saving and overproducing, winning a complete victory in the third quarter, welcoming National Day, laying a good foundation for the fourth quarter, and striving to complete the annual plan one month ahead of schedule," so that all factory workers clarified the direction of the struggle and maintained a full production mood.

At the same time, the factory director's responsibility has been greatly strengthened than before. The three factory directors have clear divisions of labor and defined responsibilities. In order to effectively manage the factory's planning, technology, finance, and costs, a three-level responsibility system was established from the factory director to the workshop director and section chief. All factory's quarterly and monthly production plans, after being discussed by the Party Committee and mobilized for discussion and implementation by the masses, the factory director organizes all departments, workshops, and work section workers to go all out to work. For example, after the third quarter's plan was determined, the three factory directors held a meeting every morning to check the work progress of the previous day, study the action plan for the day, and solve problems in a timely manner. Factory Director Li Lun attended a scheduling meeting convened by the production planning department every two days, and handled all production problems that could be solved on the spot. For example, at a scheduling meeting, the factory director found that the foundry workshop had thickened the castings of the mine car wheels, and the screws in the machining workshop were correspondingly short, which would affect the installation of the mine cars. The factory director immediately decided that the forging, riveting, and machining workshops should change the specifications of the screws to ensure the installation of the mine cars. Therefore, the factory's total output value plan for July has been overfulfilled, the task of eighteen dry grinding machines has been completed in accordance with national quality standards, and the task of forty mine cars has been completed with seventy mine cars.

    党委主动　厂长尽责　职工添劲
    济南冶金矿山设备厂认真贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制
    据大众日报消息　济南冶金矿山设备厂，认真贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制，党委书记工作更加主动，厂长职责明确，干部心情舒畅，职工干劲倍增，增产节约运动热火朝天。
    该厂自去年大跃进以来，由于党在企业中的领导作用大大加强，和全厂职工的冲天干劲，1958年总产值完成了三千九百多万元，等于1957年的249.96％；劳动生产率比1957年提高了40％多。
    为了保证今年继续跃进，进一步加强企业管理，切实贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制度，厂党委于今年第二季度初，曾组织党委委员和党支部书记学习了党的有关文件，具体分析检查了党委领导下的厂长负责制执行的情况，并采取了以下行动措施：
      健全集体领导加强党的领导核心
    自从党的第八届代表大会以来，这个厂党的集体领导制度是逐步加强的，但也存在着一些缺点，主要表现在：党委全体会议开的少，重大问题讨论得不够深透，有时书记亲自答复和处理了一些应该由行政上处理的问题，厂长也不知道。这样，既影响了行政负责干部的积极性，又助长了他们一切依赖书记的思想。对此，他们围绕健全党的集体领导的中心环节，首先改选整顿和健全了党的基层组织。在此基础上，选举了厂的党委会，并选出常务委员会主持党的日常工作，加强了党的领导核心。其次认真开好党委全体会议和常委会议。一般的规定一月一次党委全体会，一周一次常委会。支委会一周一次，车间支部大会一月一次。通过这些党的会议活动，听取党委委员的工作汇报，讨论党的方针政策贯彻执行情况和全厂的重大问题，经过充分讨论，然后作出结论。这样就达到了思想一致，行动统一，贯彻各项工作更加迅速有力。第三党委决议必须慎重，一经决定，必须坚决贯彻。该厂党组织掌握着这样一个精神，遇有问题，一般都是正副书记和常委首先交谈，接着分头和其他党委委员交谈，最后再集中起来进行酝酿。做到互通情况，充分准备，使决议切实可行。对于一些重大问题，不仅在党委成员中进行酝酿，还召集车间支部、科室的有关同志，广泛进行商量，使党的决议有充分的群众基础。第四建立与健全党内民主生活，充分发挥党员的骨干作用。从第二季度以来在各级党组织中，定期开展批评与自我批评，提倡坚持真理，勇于修正错误的共产主义风格。5月份开始，并在全厂一百四十一名党员中普遍开展了党性好、生产任务完成好、群众关系好、学习好、社会活动好的“党员五好”运动。在第二季度开展的质量竞赛运动中，车钳、锻铆、机修三个车间的八十四名党员，经评比检查，人人保证了产品质量，并带动全体工人开展了突击质量的运动，使出厂产品都达到了国家规定的质量标准。
    党委抓关键厂长组织实现生产计划
    加强党委领导下的厂长负责制，党委究竟抓什么？厂长负责制到底怎么贯彻执行？根据矿山设备厂几个月来实践的点滴经验：党委应该主要抓党的政治思想工作，认真贯彻群众路线，充分发动群众，发挥党、政、工、团的组织作用，来保证全面完成厂内每个时期的生产任务；厂长主要是依据党委决定的重大方针、原则，负责全厂行政方面的全面工作，具体组织各个科室、车间、工段，来按日、按旬、按月实现全厂各个时期的生产计划。
    第二季度以来，该厂党委按照这个原则，根据厂内职工思想和生产中的关键问题，及时地分析形势，抓关键，进行党的政治思想工作，给全体职工及时指出前进的方向。如第二季度初，由于新产品多，原材料不足，职工们对完成生产计划存有畏难情绪。厂党委认真分析了这种情况，根据上级党委指示精神，发动全体职工动脑筋，想办法，千方百计，战胜困难，开源节流，争取完成任务。这样，大大鼓起了职工们的干劲，结果第二季度的总产值完成计划的104.59％，六种重点产品除卷扬机外，其余都超额完成了计划，并保证了规格质量。
    职工们看到计划完成得不错，又产生了松劲情绪。这时，党委立即召开全厂职工代表大会，分析了完成第三季度任务的有利条件和指出存在的困难，及时提出：“继续鼓足干劲，节约超产，夺取第三季度全胜，迎接国庆节，为第四季度打好基础，力争提前一月完成全年计划”的奋斗目标，使全厂职工明确了奋斗方向，保持了饱满的生产情绪。
    与此同时，厂长的责任比从前大大地加强了。三个厂长都有明确分工，划分了职责范围。为了把全厂的计划管理、技术管理、财务成本管理切实搞好，从厂长到车间主任、工段长建立了三级责任制。凡厂的季度和月的生产计划，经过党委讨论，发动群众讨论落实以后，厂长就组织各个科室、车间、工段工人鼓足全力去干。例如，第三季度的计划确定之后，三个厂长每天早晨开一次碰头会，检查头天的工作进度，研究当天行动计划，发现问题及时解决。厂长李伦同志两天参加一次由生产计划科负责召开的调度会议，当场处理能够解决的一切生产问题。如在一次调度会议上，厂长发现翻砂车间把矿车轮的铸件加厚了，加工车间的螺丝就相应的短了，势将影响矿车的安装。厂长马上决定锻铆和加工车间改变螺丝规格，保证了矿车的安装。因此，厂内7月份的总产值计划已超额完成，十八台干碾机的任务按照国家质量标准全部完成了计划，四十台矿车的任务完成了七十台。
