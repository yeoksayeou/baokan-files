　　This newspaper reports that the twenty-day health inspection in Guizhou Province has concluded. The inspection results show that the province achieved great success in various health initiatives centered on eliminating pests and diseases during the first half of this year.

　　The inspection team visited more than 120 communes in 51 counties and cities, specifically inspecting more than 1,200 units, including government offices, schools, production teams, nurseries, service industries, streets, canteens, factories, mines, and construction sites. Leaders at all levels attached great importance to this inspection. Many regions studied the suggestions made by the inspection team and quickly made improvements. The inspection not only summarized achievements and exchanged experiences but also greatly promoted the movement to eliminate pests and diseases.

　　In the past six months, various regions across the province launched several waves of concentrated campaigns of varying intensity in conjunction with holidays such as "New Year's Day," "Spring Festival," "May Day," and "July 1st," eliminating the "four pests." Combined with the accumulation and delivery of fertilizer, a widespread cleanup of the environment was carried out, clearing away garbage and manure, further changing the sanitary conditions of urban and rural areas, and reducing mosquito and fly breeding grounds. While eliminating the "four pests" and emphasizing hygiene, special districts and counties also comprehensively launched the work of eradicating the "five diseases," focusing on eliminating malaria. The province has now generally completed two rounds of malaria anti-relapse treatment with medication, and investigations and surveys have been conducted for hookworm disease, schistosomiasis, and venereal diseases. Compared to the same period last year (January to June), the incidence of malaria has decreased by 87.77%; dysentery has decreased by 32.65%. Although infectious diseases such as measles, whooping cough, and influenza occurred in some areas, they were quickly controlled and eradicated.

　　The characteristic of the health work in the past six months has been the strengthening of addressing the root causes and general infrastructure construction while treating the symptoms. Various regions have been actively engaged in producing and accumulating fertilizer, carrying out "three major moves," renovating toilets, sealing manure pits, and comprehensively treating mosquito and fly breeding sites. For example, the Qingkou management area of the Duoque Commune in Langdai County adopted the method of timely removal, fixed-point storage, and centralized composting of garbage and manure, effectively controlling the breeding of mosquitoes and flies. Other areas, such as Daguan in Qianxi County, Zhongying in Pu'an County, Xinwu in Zunyi City, Xinzhai in Jinping County, Gongshanpo in Guiyang City, and Chengguan Town in Songtao Miao Autonomous County, have done a good job in completely eliminating mosquito and fly breeding sites. Most regions have also established a cleaning inspection system through concentrated efforts to regularize hygiene work, ensuring that every household is clean, everywhere is tidy, and the density of the "four pests" is reduced.

　　Diligent elimination of pests and diseases has played a significant role in ensuring the health of the masses and promoting production. For example, in the Daguan Commune of Qianxi County, because the hygiene work was meticulously done, there has not been a single case of "malaria" in the entire team, and only individual cases of infant diarrhea have occurred. This ensures the labor attendance rate. In the Xinwu Management Area of the Xinzhou Commune in Zunyi City, the attendance rate of commune members has reached over 98% due to the successful elimination of pests and diseases.

　　In conjunction with the development of the work to eliminate pests and diseases, various regions have also reorganized and consolidated grassroots health organizations.

　　However, the progress of health work in the province is not yet balanced. For example, hygiene in government offices and factories is generally not as good as in residential areas; some regions have neglected addressing the root causes; a few cadres are still afraid that hygiene work will affect production and have a fear of difficulties regarding the elimination of pests and diseases; some health workers have not gone deep among the masses, focusing only on treatment and neglecting mass movements.

### 既治标　又治本　除四害　灭五病　贵州上半年卫生工作取得辉煌成就

　　既治标　又治本　除四害　灭五病
　　贵州上半年卫生工作取得辉煌成就
    本报讯　贵州省历时二十天的卫生大检查，已经结束。从检查结果看，全省以除害灭病为中心的各项卫生工作，在今年上半年取得了很大成绩。
    检查团共到了五十一个县、市的一百二十多个公社，具体检查了机关、学校、生产队、托儿所、服务行业、街道、食堂、厂矿、工地等一千二百多个单位。对这次检查，各级领导都很重视，不少地区对检查团所提出的意见，大都作了研究，并迅速加以改进。通过检查，不仅总结了成绩，交流了经验，并把除害灭病运动大大推进了一步。
    半年来，全省各地结合“元旦”、“春节”、“五一”、“七一”等节日活动，开展了多次程度不同的突击运动，消灭了四害。并结合积肥、送肥，普遍地进行了环境卫生的打扫，清除了垃圾、粪便，进一步改变了城乡的卫生面貌，减少了蚊蝇孳生场地。在除四害讲卫生的同时，各专区、县又全面开展了以消灭疟疾为重点的灭“五病”工作。现在全省已普遍结束了二次疟疾抗复发治疗服药，对钩、丝虫病、性病等也进行了调查、摸底。如以今年1月到6月与去年同期相比，疟疾降低了87.77％；痢疾下降32.65％；麻疹、百日咳、流感等传染病，虽在个别地区发生流行，但很快就被控制和扑灭了。
    半年来，卫生工作的特点是：在治标的同时，加强了治本和一般基本建设的工作。各地抓紧生产积肥，纷纷进行“三大搬家”，改建厕所，密封粪坑，对蚊蝇孳生场所作了全面处理。如郎岱县堕却公社的青口管理区，对垃圾、粪便采取了及时清除、定点存放、集中堆肥的办法，有力地控制了蚊蝇的孳生。其他如黔西县的大关、普安县的中营、遵义市的新武、锦屏县的新寨、贵阳市的公山坡、松桃苗族自治县的城关镇等许多地区，对彻底消灭蚊蝇孳生场地都做得较好。大部分地区通过突击，还订立了清洁检查制度，使卫生工作经常化，做到家家清洁，处处干净，四害密度下降。
    由于认真除害灭病，对保证群众健康和促进生产起了重大作用。像黔西县大关公社因为卫生工作搞得细致，目前，全队没有发生一例
  “疟疾”病患，小儿腹泻也仅个别发生。这样，就保证了劳动出勤率，遵义市新舟公社新武管理区，由于除害灭病工作搞得好，社员出勤率达到了98％以上。
    结合除害灭病工作的开展，各地还整顿、巩固了基层卫生组织。
    但是，全省卫生工作的进展还不够平衡。如机关、厂矿的卫生，一般不如街道居民搞得好；有的地区忽视了治本；有少数干部还怕搞卫生会影响生产，对除害灭病产生畏难情绪；有的卫生人员还未深入群众，只管治疗，忽视了群众运动。（附图片）
