Clearing Semi-Finished Products, Eliminating Backlog
Shanghai Mechanical Bureau Grasps Tightly the Handling of Backlogged Work-in-Progress and Semi-Finished Products

(According to a *Liberation Daily* report) The Shanghai Municipal Mechanical Industry Bureau has requested that all companies and enterprises conduct a thorough clearing of backlogged work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and finished products. It also calls for taking active measures based on different situations to quickly handle them, in order to improve the abnormal phenomenon of a large backlog of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and finished products currently in enterprises.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Shanghai's mechanical industry has produced a large number of urgently needed machines and equipment, supporting national construction. At the same time, due to frequent changes in production tasks, abnormal supplies of certain materials and collaborative parts, coupled with unsound enterprise management systems, poor quality of some products, and untimely product allocation and transfer, a considerable amount of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and finished products have been backlogged. For example, the Jianshe Machine Factory and Jingye Machine Factory originally produced parts for some fertilizer equipment and tractors, petroleum machinery, and other accessories. Later, in order to rush-produce key equipment for rolling steel and metallurgy, the original products had to be discontinued midway, and these products were backlogged. The Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory has a batch of semi-finished products of crushers, hoists, and blowers, which have not been assembled and shipped out of the factory and packed for a long time due to the lack of bearings or packing wood, resulting in a backlog of funds of 900,000 yuan.

In order to understand the backlog of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and finished products, the Shanghai Municipal Mechanical Industry Bureau conducted a special inspection of twenty-three factories under its jurisdiction and found that all factories except one had varying degrees of backlog. The idle funds accounted for more than one-quarter of the total bank loans of the above-mentioned factories, and the amount of interest to be paid each month was very large.

The deployment made according to the results of this inventory is that, in addition to handling the backlogged finished products under the leadership and cooperation of relevant departments in the city, all companies and enterprises must conduct a thorough clearing and inventory of the currently backlogged work-in-progress, semi-finished products, etc., calculate and estimate the quantity and output value of these backlogged materials, classify them according to their causes, and then study measures based on the specific situation to find ways to deal with them. The handling principles are: 1. For backlogged work-in-progress and semi-finished products with more than 70%-80% of materials invested, more than half of the processing completed, and those materials needed to complete the plan in the second half of the year, efforts should be made to adjust surpluses and deficiencies to solve the problem of material supply, continue to invest materials, and quickly turn them into useful products. 2. Although more than 50% of the materials have been invested, but there is no need for them in the second half of the year, they should be cleared out, properly kept, and strive for re-production next year. 3. Some materials have already been invested, but after careful identification of the work-in-progress and semi-finished products, the quality is poor and cannot be used, they should be scrapped immediately. 4. Not much material has been invested, and there is no need for them to complete the task in the second half of the year, but they can be used as accessories needed by the market and should be sold as accessories.

Now, in accordance with the unified deployment of the bureau, all companies and directly affiliated factories have established work-in-progress and semi-finished product handling groups, thoroughly mobilizing the masses, actively carrying out work, and striving to fundamentally change the abnormal situation of large backlogs of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, etc., in the shortest possible time.

    清理半成品　消除积压
    上海机械局抓紧处理积压的在制品和半成品
    据解放日报消息　上海市机械工业局要求各公司和企业对积压的在制品、半成品和成品进行一次彻底的清理，并根据不同情况，采取积极措施，迅速加以处理，以改善目前企业中在制品、半成品和成品大量积压的不正常现象。
    上海市机械工业从去年大跃进以来，生产了大批急需的机器和设备，支援了国家建设。同时，由于生产任务变动较多，某些材料和协作件供应不正常，加上企业管理制度不健全，部分产品质量较差，产品的分配调拨也不及时，因此积压了不少的在制品、半成品和成品。如建设机器厂和精业机器厂，原来分别生产部分化肥设备和拖拉机、石油机械等配件；后来为了突击赶制轧钢、冶金等重点设备，原产品不得不中途停产，这些产品就被积压起来。上海矿山机器厂有一批破碎机和启闭机、鼓风机的半成品，因为缺少轴承或装箱木料，长期未能装配出厂和装箱发货，积压资金九十万元。
    为了了解在制品、半成品和成品积压的情况，上海市机械工业局曾对所属二十三个工厂进行了一次专门的检查，发现除一家工厂以外，其余各厂都有不同程度的积压，搁置的资金占上述各厂银行贷款总额四分之一以上，每月要支付的利息数量很大。
    按照这次清查结果所作的部署是，除积压的成品在市的有关部门领导和配合下进行处理外，各公司和企业必须对目前积压的在制品、半成品等进行一次彻底的清理和盘点，计算和估算这些积压物资的数量与产值，分别原因进行归类，然后根据具体情况，研究措施，设法加以处理。处理原则：一、凡积压的在制品与半成品投料在70％—80％以上，加工量已达一半以上，而且这些物资在下半年完成计划中有需要的，应设法调剂有无，解决材料供应问题，继续投料，使它迅速变成有用的产品。二、投料虽在50％以上，但下半年并无需要，应将它们清理出来，妥为保管，争取明年再生产。三、已经投了一部分料，但在制品、半成品经过认真鉴定，质量不好，不能使用的，应即报废。四、投料不多，下半年完成任务中也无需要，但却可作市场需要的配件使用，应作配件出售。
    现在，按照局的统一部署，各公司和直属厂都已成立了在制品、半成品处理小组，深入发动群众，积极开展工作，争取在最短时期内，使在制品、半成品等大量积压的不正常情况有一个根本的改变。
