    Good “Locomotive”
    Advanced producers are like locomotives, able to drive the vast number of workers forward.
    Just by serving as a banner, they can play this driving role: pointing out the direction, providing experience, allowing the vast number of workers to "track and chase," catching up.
    Many advanced producers are not satisfied with only playing the role of a banner. They also act like locomotives, actively "hooking up cars," actively helping others, directly driving those around them to advance together at full speed. Wu Lianghu is such a person. Not only did he do a good job in production, making his team an advanced team, but he also resolutely followed the Party's assignment, going to two backward teams one after another to work, helping them also become advanced units, making the entire workshop's production take a leap forward.
    The reason why Wu Lianghu can do this is because he has a selfless, communist style of putting the collective first. One flower cannot make a spring scene. In the current new high tide of increasing production and practicing economy, if all advanced producers establish this communist style, actively and enthusiastically helping the backward catch up with the advanced, then the leaping flowers on our industrial front will bloom more luxuriantly, and the spring will be even more enchanting!

### 好“火车头”

    好“火车头”
    先进生产者好比火车头，可以带动广大职工前进。
    单是作为旗帜，就可以起这种带动作用：指出方向，提供经验，让广大职工能“跟踪追迹”，赶上前去。
    许多先进生产者并不满足于只起旗帜作用。他们还像火车头一样，主动地去“挂车”，主动地去帮助别人，直接地把自己周围的人带动起来，一起飞驰前进。吴良湖就是这样的人。他不但自己搞好生产，使自己领导的小组成为先进小组，还坚决遵照党的分配，先后到两个落后小组去工作，帮助他们也变成了先进单位，使整个车间的生产跃进一步。
    吴良湖所以能作到这一点，因为他有大公无私，一切为了集体的共产主义风格。一朵鲜花打扮不出春天的景色。在目前的增产节约新高潮中，所有先进生产者都树立起这种共产主义风格，主动、热情地去帮助落后赶上先进，那末，我们工业战线上的跃进花朵将会开得更加茂盛，春色将会更加迷人！
