Politics takes command to implement the Party's line, policies, and directions, and to fully mobilize the masses, inspire enthusiasm, and overcome various undesirable tendencies and slackening moods. Politics takes command by conducting strong political and ideological leadership, thoroughly implementing socialist and communist political and ideological education, fully mobilizing the masses, and holding high the red banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. Grasping political ideology is grasping the soul of the work. The Communist Party Committee of Wannianging People's Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, has precisely grasped this point of "politics takes command" and greatly strengthened the Party's leading role in the commune.

In the early stage of the commune's establishment, the Wannianging Commune Party Committee lacked leadership experience and therefore grasped the daily affairs of the commune, forming abnormal phenomena, and even making some decisions that did not conform to the actual situation. From this experience and lesson, they realized that they must improve their leadership methods and get rid of daily affairs. Now, they focus on: implementing the Party and state's policies, determining the principles for commune production management and formulating construction plans, strengthening the political and ideological work of the masses, and so on. These points are grasped correctly and well.

The experience of the Wannianging Commune Party Committee in improving leadership methods shows that when the Party Committee grasps politics, it can strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership, bring the role of the Commune Management Committee into full play, avoid the phenomenon of handling everything, big and small, and free up time to truly promote the fine traditions of the mass line and seeking truth from facts. The work of the Wannianging Commune Party Committee is more in-depth than before, investigation and research have been strengthened, and typical experiences have been summarized to help grassroots cadres improve their leadership capabilities. This has played a better leading and promoting role in the commune's production. The Party Committees of communes in various places can refer to the leadership methods of the Wannianging Commune Party Committee, improve leadership, strengthen leadership, realize true political command, set off a vigorous mass movement, and strive for a great victory in this year's autumn harvest.

　　政治挂帅
    政治挂帅，才能贯彻执行党的路线、政策和方针，也才能充分发动群众，鼓舞干劲，克服各种不良倾向和松劲情绪。政治挂帅，就是要做好政治思想领导工作，深入进行社会主义、共产主义的政治思想教育工作，充分作好思想发动，把总路线和大跃进的红旗高高举起。抓住了政治思想，也就抓住了工作的灵魂。中共山西省汾阳县万年青公社委员会正是抓住了“政治挂帅”这一条，大大地加强了党对公社的领导作用。
    万年青公社党委会在建社初期，缺乏领导经验，因而抓了公社的日常事务工作，形成了不正常的现象，甚至作出了一些不符合实际情况的决定。他们从这一经验教训中，认识到必须改进领导方法，摆脱日常事务工作。现在，他们着重抓的是：贯彻党和国家的方针政策，确定公社生产管理方面的原则和制订建设规划，加强群众的政治思想工作，等等。这几条抓得对，抓得好。
    万年青公社党委改进领导方法的经验表明，党委抓了政治挂帅，就能加强党的政治思想领导作用，就能发挥公社管理委员会的作用，避免了事无大小一把抓的事务主义现象，就可以腾出手来真正发扬群众路线和实事求是的优良传统。万年青公社党委的工作比从前深入了，调查研究加强了，并且总结了典型经验，帮助基层干部提高领导能力。这就对公社的生产更好地发挥了领导和促进的作用。各地公社党委可以参考万年青公社党委的领导方法，改进领导，加强领导，实现真正的政治挂帅，掀起蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动，争取今年秋季丰收的伟大胜利。
