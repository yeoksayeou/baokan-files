　　Ili Apples Hit the Market

　　Fruit farmers along the Ili River have made full use of the favorable conditions provided by the communes, strengthened orchard management, and overcome the most serious pest infestation in years, increasing apple production by more than 30% compared to 1957. There are more than forty varieties of Ili apples, with about 400,000 fruit trees distributed in Yining, Huocheng, Suiding, Tekes, Xinyuan and other counties and cities, with Yining City and Yining County having the most fruit trees. Yining City, known as a city of flowers and fruits, has more than 200,000 fruit trees. In addition to more than 200 larger orchards in the three suburban communes, almost every household in the city has an orchard. This year, more than 40,000 to 50,000 fruit trees in Yining City and Yining County are bearing fruit, an increase of nearly 20% compared to last year. The fruit-bearing forests in Huocheng, Suiding, Tekes, and other counties have also increased compared to last year.

　　Since the beginning of this spring, various regions have suffered from varying degrees of wind damage, especially pests such as gypsy moths, red spiders, and codling moths, resulting in a slight decrease in apple production compared to last year. However, thanks to the timely efforts of commune members of all ethnic groups to combat pests, and the adoption of measures such as timely watering, weeding, and increased fertilization, production has still increased compared to 1957. According to key surveys, the yield of early-maturing apples in the Hongqi Commune of Yining City reached more than 70 jin per tree, nearly double the increase compared to 1957, and the average yield per mu can reach 1,000 jin, an increase of 33% compared to 1957.

　　Currently, Ili apples are being marketed continuously. While busy harvesting, fruit farmers are also launching a high tide of mid- and late-stage field management to ensure production and quality. Commune members have put forward the slogan "Make a lean year like a good year, turn a poor harvest into a bumper harvest" to increase the production of more and better apples to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

　　伊犁苹果上市
    伊犁河沿岸的果农充分利用公社的有利条件，加强果园管理，战胜了历年来最严重的一次虫害，使苹果产量比1957年增产30％以上。伊犁苹果共有四十多个品种，约四十余万株果树，分布在伊宁、霍城、绥定、特克斯、新源等县、市，其中以伊宁市和伊宁县的果树为最多。被誉为花果城市的伊宁市，就有果树二十余万株，除郊区三个公社有二百多个较大的果园外，市内居民几乎家家都有果园。伊宁市和伊宁县今年结果的果树在四五万株以上，比去年增加了近20％。霍城、绥定、特克斯等县的结果林也较去年增多。
    今年入春以来，由于各地遭受了不同程度的风害，特别是巢娥虫、红蜘蛛、食心虫等灾害，因而苹果产量较去年有所减少。由于各族社员及时展开了消灭虫害的斗争，采取了适时浇水、除草和增施肥料等措施，产量仍比1957年有所增加。根据重点调查，伊宁市红旗公社早熟苹果的产量，每株达七十余斤，比1957年增产近一倍，平均亩产可达一千斤，比1957年增产33％。
    目前，伊犁苹果已源源上市，果农们一面忙着摘收，一面又掀起了保产保质的中后期田间管理高潮。社员们提出“小年赶大年，欠收变丰收”，以增产更多更好的苹果迎接国庆十周年。
