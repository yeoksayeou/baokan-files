　　Making model airplanes is a popular national defense sports activity with a broad mass base. With the improvement of scientific and technological knowledge, modern model airplanes have developed into very complex items. They can be basically divided into eight categories: namely, model gliders, rubber band powered model airplanes and rubber band powered model helicopters, piston engine model airplanes and piston engine model helicopters, jet engine model airplanes, as well as radio-controlled model airplanes and radio-controlled model gliders. These model airplanes can respectively create records for flight speed, straight-line flight distance, flight altitude, and flight duration.
　　Since there are too many types of model airplanes, international competitions generally only hold competitions for piston engine model airplanes, rubber band powered model airplanes, and model gliders (i.e., competition for duration of flight. In international competitions, model airplanes must fly five times, and each time they can fly for three minutes to get full marks), as well as speed competitions for line-controlled piston engine or jet engine model airplanes, and aerobatic flight competitions for line-controlled or radio-controlled piston engine model airplanes. These competitions have relatively strict regulations on the size and weight of model airplanes, the size of the engine cylinder capacity, the weight of the rubber bands, and the method of takeoff, etc. In these competitions, the results can be quickly known at the end.
　　Other model airplanes, such as the piston engine model helicopter for which Chinese aeromodelling athletes set a world record in April this year, are not part of international competitions. Nevertheless there are certain requirements when creating a record with it. For example, the total weight of the model airplane cannot exceed five kilograms, and it must take off from the ground. Because model airplanes can fly very high and very far, the timers even have to sit on real airplanes (such as helicopters) to track them in order to determine the duration of flight during record-breaking flights, or the communication address must be written on the model airplane, and after the person who finds the model airplane informs and proves where it landed, people will be sent to investigate, measure the location, and review various related conditions. Therefore, it takes a considerable amount of time to confirm the results. For example, Liu Litian’s piston engine model helicopter took off from the Liangxiang China People's Aviation Club Airport on April 26 this year and disappeared shortly thereafter. It was later discovered by members of the nearby Boli People's Commune on the beach of the Yongding River. After measurement, it was found that its straight-line flight distance was 18.038 kilometers.

　　航空模型常识
　  制作模型飞机是一项具有广泛群众性的国防体育活动。随着科学技术知识水平的提高，现代的模型飞机已经发展成为十分复杂的东西。它基本上可以分为八大类：即模型滑翔机，橡筋动力模型飞机和橡筋动力模型直升飞机，活塞式发动机模型飞机和活塞式发动机模型直升飞机，喷气式发动机模型飞机，以及无线电操纵模型飞机和无线电操纵模型滑翔机等。这些模型飞机可以分别创造出飞行速度、飞行直线距离、飞行高度和留空时间的纪录。
    由于模型飞机种类太多，所以国际比赛中一般只举行活塞式发动机模型飞机、橡筋动力模型飞机和模型滑翔机竞时（即比赛留空时间。在国际比赛中，模型飞机要飞五次，每次在空中能飞行三分钟就得满分），以及线操纵活塞式或喷气式发动机模型飞机竞速，线操纵或无线电操纵活塞式发动机模型飞机特技飞行等几项比赛。这些比赛对模型飞机的大小、重量，发动机汽缸容积的大小，橡筋的重量，起飞的方法等等，都有比较严格的规定。这种比赛，在结束的当时就能很快地知道成绩。
    另一些模型飞机，如我国航空模型选手今年4月间创造了世界纪录的活塞式发动机模型直升飞机，在国际比赛中，虽然不举行这个项目的比赛，但对它创造纪录时的条件也有一定的规定，如模型飞机的总重量不能超过五公斤，必须从地面起飞等。由于模型飞机能飞得很高、很远，因而在创纪录飞行时，计时员甚至必须坐上真的飞机（如直升飞机）追踪才能肯定留空时间多少，或在模型飞机上写明通讯地址，等捡到这架模型飞机的人通知和证明落在什么地方后，再派人去调查，测定位置及审核各种有关条件等，所以肯定它的成绩需要相当长的时间。例如航空模型选手刘立天的活塞式发动机模型直升飞机，今年4月26日从良乡中国人民航空俱乐部机场起飞后不久，就看不见了。后来被附近的玻璃人民公社社员在永定河的沙滩上发现，经过测量，才得知它的飞行直线距离是十八点零三八公里。
