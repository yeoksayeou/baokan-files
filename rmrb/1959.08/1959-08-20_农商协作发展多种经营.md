　　Developing diversified economy vigorously while developing grain and cash crop production, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery is a very important task in the current rural economic work.

　　In 1958, the output value of diversified economy (other than grain and major cash crops) accounted for about 40% of the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries. 80% of light industrial raw materials came from rural areas, and diversified economy products accounted for a considerable proportion of this. In people's daily economic life, people are almost always in contact with rural diversified economy products. Developing diversified economy can provide more raw materials for industry, provide more consumer goods for the people, provide more export commodities for the country, increase accumulation for rural people's communes, and increase income for commune members. In short, developing diversified economy can promote the development of industrial and agricultural production and meet the people's growing and diverse needs.

　　Undoubtedly, in the rural economy, agriculture is the fundamental aspect; grain has always been and will continue to be the most precious thing. If agriculture does not develop and grain production does not increase, it will affect the development of the entire national economy, and diversified economy will lose its foundation for development. The correct policy is: to focus on the production of grain and major cash crops, while vigorously developing diversified economy. As long as practical arrangements are made according to local resources, labor, and capital conditions, grain production and diversified economy can promote each other, complement each other, and serve as conditions for each other's development.

　　Since the beginning of this year, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, diversified economy has developed to varying degrees in various regions, and both the quantity and output value have increased compared with the same period last year; moreover, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and the situation is very favorable. The current problem is that the development of diversified economy is not balanced enough between regions, between varieties, and between self-sufficient parts and commercial parts, and it cannot meet the needs of national economic development and people's lives. In order to promote the planned and proportional comprehensive development of diversified economy, commercial departments must closely cooperate with agricultural departments, make unified plans under the leadership of the Party committee, and comprehensively arrange to combine the utilization of local important material resources with the needs of the country, and combine production plans with market needs. The Heilongjiang Province's plan to focus on the development of four major non-staple foods (pigs, vegetables, fish, poultry), seven major industrial raw materials (rosin, alkali, fur, silkworm cocoons, woven products, straw mats, pyrite), and fifty varieties, and the Sichuan Province's plan to focus on twelve major items such as cotton, oil, hemp, tobacco, tea, pigs, vegetables, poultry, fish, silkworms, fruits, and medicinal materials, are based on local conditions and are tailored to local conditions, with clear objectives and priorities, and have therefore played a good role in guiding production.

　　Diversified economy has a wide range of production methods and many varieties, and it is impossible to include all of them in the national plan. Therefore, it is particularly important to give play to the characteristics of commercial departments that are familiar with production and sales, familiar with regional and market conditions, to participate in production planning. In the process of formulating plans, commercial departments should help people's communes as much as possible to calculate various accounts such as local resources, labor, product varieties, self-sufficient parts and commercial parts, economic benefits, total output value, and income distribution, so as to correctly handle the proportional relationship between varieties, between means of production and means of livelihood, between self-sufficient parts and commercial parts, and between accumulation and consumption, so that diversified economy with large and small profits, fast and slow profits, large and small quantities, can cooperate with each other and be comprehensively managed. When formulating plans and organizing diversified economy, attention should be paid to first developing varieties that are urgently needed for the national economy and the people's livelihood, so as to meet the current needs of production and people's lives.

　　Rapidly developing diversified economy must implement the policy of "walking on two legs," with both collective management and individual production going hand in hand. The production characteristics of diversified economy determine that various management methods must be adopted. Since the people's commune movement, many projects that could not be operated within the scope of agricultural production cooperatives in the past can now be carried out by concentrating efforts. The superiority of the people's commune has opened up a broad path for the development of diversified economy, which is a very favorable condition for the development of diversified economy. At the same time, there are still many small and scattered products that cannot be completely managed by the collective. Some products are not only suitable for decentralized management at present, but also cannot be completely replaced by collective management for a certain period of time in the future. Therefore, the scope of management should be divided according to the different production conditions in various places and for various varieties, and the foundation of collective management. Generally speaking, those that are seasonal or technically strong, and require a lot of capital and labor, should be managed by the collective; some small and scattered production projects should be encouraged for commune members' families and individuals to produce; some varieties can be collectively managed, while also encouraging and organizing commune members to produce individually. The income from collective management must be implemented in accordance with the principle of distribution according to work; the income from individual management is entirely owned by the individual. The issue of income distribution in diversified economy involves the reasonable balance with agricultural labor remuneration, and involves the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption. A set of practical and simple methods must be formulated to encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses.

　　Will encouraging individual management within a certain range affect collective production? No. Because the economic power of socialist public ownership has occupied an absolute advantage in our country, individual management is only a supplement to collective management, it cannot hire workers or engage in speculation, and the income from management is only labor remuneration outside of collective labor time, not exploitation. The scope of diversified economy, the labor time of commune members, and various people's communes all have unified plans, with both the unified management of large collectives and the decentralized management of individuals. As long as the Party's policies are correctly implemented, and reasonable arrangements are made, it can be guaranteed that commune members mainly participate in collective production, while also taking into account individual management. Of course, if the arrangements are not good and the management is not good, it may also produce some factors that are unfavorable to collective production and the market, but that is a leadership issue and a management issue, and should be resolved by improving leadership and improving management level, rather than the problem of diversified economy itself.

　　One of the important purposes of developing diversified economy is to develop commodity production and provide more commodity volume for society to meet the growing needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Under normal circumstances, when production increases, the commodity volume will also increase accordingly. However, if the arrangements are not good and the plan is not comprehensive, it may happen that production increases, but the commodity rate does not increase, and even the commodity volume does not increase. Therefore, commercial departments must help people's communes to reasonably arrange consumption plans while participating in production, so that the commodity part and the consumption part of diversified economy products maintain a correct proportion, and the commodity volume continues to increase, so that it is conducive to increasing accumulation, expanding reproduction, conducive to material exchanges between urban and rural areas, and conducive to the development of the national economy and the increase of social wealth. Therefore, it is necessary to promote to the masses the principles of diligence and thrift in running communes, diligence and thrift in managing households, and learning to live a good life, so that collectives and individuals have some savings, and that the lives of the masses gradually improve with the development of production. This is an extremely meticulous economic work, and it is also a political work of great significance.

　　Commercial departments doing a good job in purchasing and supply work is of great significance for promoting the development of diversified economy; in the case of the universal growth of agricultural and sideline production, this task is even more arduous. At present, the peak season for mountain goods in some areas has arrived, and in some areas it is about to arrive. Commercial departments must do a good job in preparing and organizing purchases. To do a good job in purchasing, all feasible methods to facilitate the masses' sales must be adopted, which can not only save the masses' time, but also encourage the masses' production enthusiasm. Conversely, if the purchasing work is not done well, and the products of collectives or individuals cannot be sold, and the value created by the hard work of the masses cannot be realized, it will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses and have a bad impact on production.

　　At present, a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy with grain production as the main focus and developing diversified economy is being set off in rural areas across the country. In the future, as long as agricultural and commercial sectors cooperate closely and make comprehensive arrangements under the unified leadership of the Party committee, and mobilize the masses earnestly, and all levels work together, diversified economy will surely achieve a great harvest under the impetus of the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

### 农商协作发展多种经营

　　农商协作发展多种经营
    在发展粮食和经济作物生产的同时，大力开展多种经营，使农林牧副渔全面发展，是当前农村经济工作中的一项十分重要的任务。
    1958年，全国多种经营（粮食和主要经济作物以外）的产值，占农副业总产值的40％左右。轻工业原料的80％来自农村，其中多种经营的产品占了相当的比重。在人民的日常经济生活中，几乎无时无地不和农村多种经营的产品发生联系。开展多种经营，可以为工业提供更多的原料，为人民群众提供更多的生活资料，为国家提供更多的出口物资，为农村人民公社增加积累，并且为社员增加收入。总之，开展多种经营能够促进工农业生产的发展，满足人民日益增长的多种多样的需要。
    毫无疑问，在农村经济当中，农业是根本的方面；粮食从来是，今后仍然是宝中之宝。农业不发展，粮食不增产，就会影响整个国民经济的发展，多种经营也就失去了发展的基础。正确的方针是：以粮食和主要经济作物的生产为主，同时大力开展多种经营。只要按照当地的资源、劳力、资金状况，做出切合实际的安排，那么粮食生产与多种经营就可以互相促进，互相补充，互为发展的条件。
    今年以来，在各级党委统一领导下，多种经营在各地有了不同程度的发展，数量和产值都比去年同期有所增加；而且群众的积极性很高，形势十分有利。当前的问题是，多种经营在地区之间、品种之间、自给性部分与商品性部分之间，发展还不够平衡，还不能适应国民经济的发展和人民生活的需要。为了促进多种经营有计划、按比例地全面发展，商业部门必须与农业部门密切协作，在党委领导下统一规划，全面安排，把当地的重要物质资源的利用同国家的需要结合起来，把生产规划同市场需要结合起来。黑龙江省提出的重点发展四大副食（猪、菜、鱼、禽）、七大工业原料（松香、土碱、皮毛、蚕茧、编织品、草席、硫化铁矿石）和五十个品种的规划，四川省提出的抓棉、油、麻、烟、茶、猪、菜、禽、鱼、蚕、果、药材等十二大项的规划，就是根据了当地的条件，因地制宜，有纲有目，因而对指导生产起了良好的作用。
    多种经营的生产门路广、品种多，不可能全部列入国家计划。因此，发挥商业部门联系产销、熟悉地区和市场情况的特长来参与生产规划，就显得特别重要。在制订规划当中，商业部门应当尽可能帮助人民公社算清当地的资源、劳力、产品品种、自给部分与商品部分、经济效果、生产总值以及收益分配等各种账目，从而正确处理品种之间、生产资料与生活资料之间、自给部分与商品部分之间、积累与消费之间的比例关系，使多种经营中收益大与收益小的、收益快与收益慢的、大宗的与零星的，都能够互相配合，综合经营。在制定规划和组织多种经营的时候，应该注意首先发展国计民生迫切需要的品种，以满足当前生产和人民生活上的需要。
    迅速开展多种经营必须贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，集体经营和个人生产同时并举。多种经营的生产特点，决定了必须采取多种的经营方式。人民公社化以来，许多过去在农业生产合作社的范围内无法经营的项目，现在能够集中力量举办起来。人民公社的优越性为多种经营的发展开辟了广阔的途径，这是发展多种经营的一项极为有利的条件。与此同时，也还有许多零星细小的产品，不可能完全由集体经营。有些产品，不但目前适于分散经营，即在今后一定时期内，也不是集体经营所能全部代替的。因此，应当根据各地和各个品种的不同生产条件，以及集体经营的基础来划分经营范围。一般说来，凡是季节性或技术性强、占用资金和劳动力较多的，应该由集体经营；零星分散的一些小生产项目，则宜于鼓励社员家庭和个人生产；有些品种可以在集体经营的同时，也鼓励和组织社员个人经营。集体经营的收益，要贯彻按劳分配的原则；个人经营的收益，则全部为个人所有。多种经营的收益分配问题，牵涉到与农业劳动报酬的合理平衡，牵涉到积累与消费的比例关系，必须制定一套切合实际而又简便易行的办法，以利于鼓励群众的生产积极性。
    在一定范围内鼓励个人经营，会不会影响集体生产呢？不会的。因为社会主义公有制的经济力量在我国已经占了绝对的优势，个人经营只是作为集体经营的补充，它一不能雇工，二不能倒贩，经营所得，只是在集体劳动时间以外的劳动报酬，而不是剥削。多种经营的经营范围，社员的劳动时间，各个人民公社也都有统一规划，既有大集体的统一经营，又有个人的分散经营。只要正确贯彻执行党的方针政策，合理安排，就能保证社员以参加集体生产为主，同时兼顾个人经营。当然，如果安排不好，管理不好，也可能产生若干对集体生产和市场不利的因素，但那是领导问题，管理问题，应当从改善领导、提高管理水平来解决，而不是多种经营本身的问题。
    开展多种经营的重要目的之一，在于发展商品生产，为社会提供更多的商品量，以满足工农业生产和人民生活日益增长的需要。在一般情况下，生产增长了，商品量也会随着增长。但是，如果安排不好，计划不周，也可能发生生产增长，而商品率并没有提高，甚至商品量也没有增加的情况。为此，商业部门必须在参与生产的同时，帮助人民公社合理安排消费计划，使多种经营产品的商品部分和消费部分的增长保持正确的比例，使商品量不断增加，这样才有利于增加积累、扩大再生产，有利于城乡物资交流，有利于国民经济的发展和社会财富的增加。因此需要向群众宣传勤俭办社、勤俭持家、学会过日子的道理，让集体和个人都有一些积蓄，让群众生活随着生产的发展逐步提高。这是一项极为细致的经济工作，同时也是一项具有重大意义的政治工作。
    商业部门做好收购和供应工作，对于促进多种经营的发展有重要的意义；在农副业生产普遍增长的情况下，这一任务更加繁重。目前，有些地区的山货旺季已经到来，有些地区即将到来。商业部门必须做好收购的准备工作和组织工作。要做好收购工作，必须采取一切可行的便利群众交售的办法，这样不仅可以节省群众的时间，而且可以鼓舞群众的生产热情。反之，如果收购工作做不好，集体或个人的产品卖不出去，群众辛勤劳动所创造的价值不能实现，就会挫伤群众的积极性，对生产发生不好的影响。
    目前全国农村正在掀起一个以粮食生产为主的开展多种经营的增产节约运动的新高潮。今后，只要在党委统一领导下农商密切协作，全面安排，认真发动群众，上下一齐动手，在工农业生产继续跃进的形势带动下，多种经营一定能够获得大丰收。
