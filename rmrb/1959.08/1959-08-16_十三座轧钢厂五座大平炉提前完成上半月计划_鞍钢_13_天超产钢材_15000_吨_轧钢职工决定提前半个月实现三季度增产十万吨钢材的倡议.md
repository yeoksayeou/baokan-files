Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 15th: Ansteel's rolling mill workers completed the steel production plan for the first half of August forty-three hours ahead of schedule, with an increase of more than 15,000 tons of steel from the 1st to the 13th compared to the state plan. The workers of the thirteen rolling mills also put forward new fighting goals, deciding to realize the initiative of increasing production by 100,000 tons of steel in the third quarter, proposed to rolling mills across the country, half a month ahead of schedule, to fully implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy, achieving high yield, high quality, multiple varieties, low cost, and safe production, and to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The main reason why Ansteel's rolling mills were able to complete the plan for the first half of August ahead of schedule was the attention paid to ideological work and the continuous encouragement of the workers' enthusiasm. Because the production plan for July was completed well by each factory, some cadres developed a new sense of complacency, and in the first week of August, only 76% of the plan was completed. The leaders of each factory promptly criticized this complacent mood and went to the front line to focus on the daily plan and solve key problems, and production immediately improved. From the 8th to the 12th, not only was the output owed in the first week made up, but the production plan for the first twelve days was overfulfilled. In these ten days or so, many rolling mill leaders went deep into the field and fought alongside the workers in the face of high temperatures, which further encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm and continuously raised the production level. From the 5th to the 13th, the average daily increase in steel production was more than 3,100 tons compared to the first four days of August, and on the 9th and 10th, Ansteel's highest steel production records in history were created for two consecutive days.

Another important factor for the early completion of the plan for the first half of the month by the rolling mills was the large-scale production increase and economy competition and the large-scale technical innovation on the basis of soaring drive. Since August, the workers of the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill have carried out a penetrating opponent competition, further promoted many advanced experiences such as rapid steel pouring and rapid steel rolling, greatly improving production efficiency, and overfulfilled the state production plan from the 1st to the 13th. The leading cadres of the No. 1 Medium Plate Mill worked day and night with the workers to break through the four major key problems such as the frequent breakdown of the pushing machine and the slow rotation of the motor. Since August, they have achieved daily successes, overfulfilled the state plan, and the product quality has also been greatly improved. In August, many rolling mill workers also learned from the experience of the workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces in organizing technical performances, effectively improving the level of technical operation, which also played a great role in ensuring the completion of the production plan.

At present, the rolling mill workers are advancing victoriously and continue to take various measures to strive to complete the steel production plan for the entire month of August ahead of schedule. On the morning of the 14th, the Ansteel Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of the party committee secretaries of the rolling mills to study and formulate various measures to advance the realization of the initiative to overproduce 100,000 tons of steel in the third quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 15th: Ansteel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces overfulfilled the state steel production plan for the first half of August thirteen hours ahead of schedule; in the first ten days of August, the five open-hearth furnaces produced an average of more than 340 tons of steel per day more than in the same period in July.

The workers of these five large fixed open-hearth furnaces had produced more than 10,000 tons of high-quality steel more than the state plan in July. Entering August, the factory party committee organized workers to continue to conduct technical performances, greatly breaking through the three production technology barriers of equipment and furnace maintenance, and adopted new measures of multi-loading and fast smelting, so that the entire factory quickly saw a new production upsurge. In the past ten days or so, almost every open-hearth furnace has completed the state plan every day. From August 1st to 14th, the five open-hearth furnaces produced a total of more than 2,400 tons of high-quality steel more than the state plan. Among them, the workers of Open-Hearth Furnace No. 20 smelted a furnace of steel in only seven hours and forty minutes on the 12th, shortening the time by four hours and twenty minutes compared to the state plan, creating the latest record for rapid steelmaking since this year.

The production enthusiasm of the workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces has been even higher after completing the steel production plan for the first half of the month ahead of schedule. They are conducting in-depth competitions to increase production and practice economy, determined to complete the August production plan ahead of schedule and increase the production of more high-quality steel for the country.

    十三座轧钢厂五座大平炉提前完成上半月计划
    鞍钢13天超产钢材15000吨
    轧钢职工决定提前半个月实现三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议
    据新华社鞍山15日电　鞍钢各轧钢厂职工提前四十三个小时超额完成了8月上半月钢材生产计划，1日到13日比国家计划增产钢材一万五千多吨。十三个轧钢厂职工并提出新的奋战目标，决定提前半个月实现向全国轧钢厂提出的第三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议，全面贯彻增产节约的方针，做到高产、优质、多品种、低成本和安全生产，迎接国庆十周年。
    鞍钢各轧钢厂能够提前完成8月上半月计划，主要的原因是注意思想工作，不断地鼓舞职工的干劲。由于各厂7月份生产计划完成得较好，部分干部产生了新的松劲情绪，8月第一周只完成计划76％。各厂领导及时批判了这种松劲情绪，并且亲临火线，狠抓日计划，解决关键问题，生产立即好转。8日到12日不但补上了第一周亏欠的产量，并且超额完成了前十二天的生产计划。在这十多天里，许多轧钢厂领导干部都深入现场，同职工一起冒着高温作战，从而更加鼓舞了职工的生产热情，使生产水平不断上升。5日到13日，平均每天比8月头四天增产钢材三千一百多吨，9日和10日更连续两天创造了鞍钢有史以来钢材产量最高纪录。
    各轧钢厂提前完成上半月计划的另一个重要因素，是在冲天干劲的基础上，大搞增产节约竞赛，大搞技术革新。第一初轧厂职工8月以来深入开展了对手赛，进一步推广了快速浇钢、快速轧钢等许多先进经验，大大提高了生产效率，1日到13日超额完成了国家生产计划。第一中板厂领导干部同工人一起，日夜奋战，突破了推运机经常坏、马达转动慢等四大关键问题，8月份以来做到了日日红，超额完成了国家计划，产品质量也有很大提高。8月份，不少轧钢厂职工还学习了五座大型固定式平炉职工组织技术表演的经验，有效地提高了技术操作水平，对保证完成生产计划也起了很大作用。
    目前，各轧钢厂职工正在乘胜前进，继续采取各种措施，争取提前完成8月份全月钢材生产计划。14日上午，中共鞍钢委员会召开了各轧钢厂党委书记会议，研究和拟订了提前实现在三季度超产十万吨钢材的倡议的各项措施。
    新华社鞍山15日电　鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉提前十三个小时超额完成8月上半月国家产钢计划；8月份的前十天，五座平炉平均每天比7月同期多产三百四十多吨钢。
    这五座大型固定式平炉的职工，7月份曾比国家计划多产优质钢一万多吨。进入8月，厂党委组织职工继续进行技术表演，大破设备、炉体维护等三个生产技术关，并且采取了多装快炼的新措施，使全厂迅速出现了新的生产高潮。十几天来，各个平炉差不多天天都完成国家计划。8月1日到14日，五座平炉共比国家计划多产优质钢二千四百多吨。其中，二十号平炉职工在12日只用七小时四十分钟就炼出一炉钢，比国家计划时间缩短四小时二十分，创造了今年以来快速炼钢的最新纪录。
    五座大型固定式平炉职工在提前完成上半月产钢计划以后，生产热情更加高涨。他们正在深入开展增产节约竞赛，决心提前完成8月份生产计划，为国家增产更多的优质钢。（附图片）
