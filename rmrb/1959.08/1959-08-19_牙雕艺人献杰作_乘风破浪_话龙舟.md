Ivory Carving Artists Present Masterpiece
　  "Riding the Wind and Waves" Talks About Dragon Boats

　　The large-scale ivory carving "Leaping Forward Dragon Boat" is one of the works carved by the Beijing Ivory Carving Factory to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day. It was collectively designed and created by the famous old ivory carving artist Cui Huaxuan and senior technician Sun Baoyuan, along with more than 20 others.

　　In the sound of the Great Leap Forward, the ivory carving artists of this factory, with high political enthusiasm and superb skills, carved five large-scale works, including "Tiananmen," "Leaping Forward Dragon Boat," "Large Hundred Flower Basket," "People's Commune is Good," and "Oriental Giant Dragon Flower Ball" (created in cooperation with Guangzhou artists). All five works of art are exquisitely crafted and beautifully shaped.

　　"Leaping Forward Dragon Boat" is fifty inches long, thirty inches high, and weighs two hundred and seventy pounds. The majestic dragon head extends forward, with a walnut-sized ball in its mouth, representing "the dragon playing with a pearl." The interlocked anchor chain hangs from the dragon's teeth, and when touched, it makes a "clattering" sound.

　　The three-story dragon cabin in the national style is exquisitely carved, with various patterns镂雕ed on the doors and windows of the cabin. The dragon boat is equipped with railings on both sides and along the cabin walkway, and the dragon boat cabins are carved with stairways and walkways that connect to each other. On the mast at the front end of the second-floor cabin, a flag flutters in the wind, and several doves of peace fly under the flag. On the deck and in the cabins are more than sixty figures from various fraternal nationalities of the motherland, dressed in festive costumes and dancing gracefully. On the second floor are carved folk dances such as "Little Cowherd," "Hand Drum Dance," and "Liu Hai Teases the Toad." On the third floor, lively and lovely Young Pioneers compete to release balloons and doves of peace, symbolizing the great unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland and the joyous scene of loving peace.

　　Such a magnificent work as the "Dragon Boat" is unprecedented in the history of China's ivory carving industry. The artists promoted collective wisdom in their creation, and during the design and carving process, they also received guidance and assistance from some artists and veteran artists from the Beijing Arts and Crafts Research Institute. Old artists such as Cui Huaxuan also frequently visited Beihai Park, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and other places to observe and study the traditional techniques and national style in ancient carving art. The dragon posture of the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai Park greatly inspired them in making the dragon head; the structure of the "cross ridge" of the three main halls of the Forbidden City also provided good reference material for the top of the cabin; the artists also interviewed the "Stone Boat" in the Summer Palace several times to understand the format of the cabin and the placement of the stairways and walkways.

　　牙雕艺人献杰作
　  “乘风破浪”话龙舟
    大型牙雕“跃进龙舟”是北京象牙雕刻厂为庆祝国庆十周年而雕刻的作品之一。是由著名牙雕老艺人崔华轩和老技工孙宝元等二十多人集体设计和创作的。
    这个厂的牙雕艺人在跃进声中，以高度的政治热情和精湛的技艺，雕出了“天安门”、“跃进龙舟”、“大百花篮”、“人民公社好”以及与广州艺人合作的“东方巨龙花球”等五件大型作品，这五件艺术品，都是工精形美。
    “跃进龙舟”全长五十吋，高三十吋，重达二百七十斤。威武的龙头伸向前方，龙口内衔一核桃般大小的圆球，表示“龙戏珠”。环环相套的锚链悬挂于巨龙的牙齿上，用手抚摩会发出“哗啦”、“哗啦”的响声。
    民族形式的三层龙舱，雕刻得极为精致，舱屋的门窗上镂雕着各种不同的图案。龙船两侧及舱屋甬道旁雕有冲天栏杆，龙舟舱屋均雕有楼梯走道，可以彼此相通。在二层舱前端的桅杆上有一面旗帜迎风招展，几只和平鸽在旗帜下展翅飞翔。在甲板上和舱屋中分布有六十多个祖国各兄弟民族的人物，身着盛装、翩翩起舞；二楼上雕有小放牛、手鼓舞、刘海戏金蟾等民间舞蹈；三楼上，活泼可爱的少先队员们争放气球与和平鸽。象征着祖国各族人民大团结和热爱和平的欢乐景象。
    像“龙舟”这样雄伟的作品，在我国牙雕行业史中是史无前例的。艺人们在创作中发扬了集体的智慧，在设计和雕刻过程中，还得到一些美术家和北京市工艺美术研究所的老艺人们的指导与帮助。老艺人崔华轩等也经常到北海、故宫、颐和园等处，观察和学习古代雕刻艺术中的传统手法和民族风格。北海九龙壁的龙姿对他们制作龙头有了很大的启发；故宫三大殿的
  “十字脊”的构造也给制作舱屋的顶端作了很好的参考资料，艺人们还数次采访颐和园的“石舫”，了解舱屋的格式和楼梯走道的安置方法。
