On June 16th, this newspaper published an editorial entitled "Grasp the Key to Increased Cotton Production," which proposed that the way to increase cotton yield per unit area is to vigorously promote early cotton seedling development, early flowering, early boll formation, and more bolls from pre-summer and summer blooms; and then, on the basis of ensuring summer bolls, strive for more autumn bolls. Judging from the current reports from various regions, the flowering and boll formation of most cotton fields are earlier than last year, achieving "entering summer with bolls." In Xinxiang Special District, Henan Province, more than half of the four million mu of cotton fields have achieved four to five pre-summer bolls per plant, and one-third of the cotton fields have achieved two to three pre-summer bolls per plant. This is a major victory in striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year. However, to achieve a bumper cotton harvest, much work remains to be done, and the most important task at present is to ensure summer bolls and increase autumn bolls.

The key to a bumper cotton harvest is having many large bolls. The way to achieve many large bolls is to continuously strengthen field management by making full use of the cotton's growing season. After the early stage of cotton field management is over, it is necessary to strengthen the later stage management in a timely manner. By doing so, on the one hand, we can promote the reduction of shedding of the already formed summer bolls, allowing them to grow into large bolls and mature to produce cotton; on the other hand, we should strive for the cotton plants to produce more buds, open more flowers, and form more bolls within the possible range, so that one plant bears as many bolls as two plants did in the past. This is entirely possible. According to investigations by agricultural science research departments, in the main cotton-growing areas of the Yellow River basin, there are still sixty to eighty days until the first frost; in the cotton-growing areas of the Yangtze River basin, there are still eighty days until the replanting of wheat. Therefore, strengthening management during this period can result in more cotton bolls. If each cotton plant produces two or three more cotton bolls, calculating at 4,000 plants per mu, one mu can yield more than ten jin of ginned cotton, and the country can increase production by more than ten million dan of ginned cotton. If field management work during this period is relaxed, then all previous efforts will be in vain. Not only will fewer autumn bolls be formed, but the already formed summer bolls may also be lost.

Perhaps some people will have the following views: "Once the Beginning of Autumn has passed, there is not much potential for cotton," "Pre-summer and summer bolls have already formed quite a bit, so there is no need to strive for more autumn bolls, and a bumper cotton harvest can be achieved," "Frost-after flowers are not as good as frost-before flowers." These views are all incorrect. The national bumper cotton harvest in 1958 was the result of breaking the old rules that supplementary fertilization could not be later than mid-July and that irrigation could not be carried out in the later stages, and strengthening the later stage management of cotton fields. In fact, even in cotton fields where early management was poor or due to disasters, and fewer summer bolls were formed, cotton production can still be increased as long as efforts are made to increase autumn bolls. Last year, Macheng County in Hubei Province suffered severe flooding in mid-August in most of its cotton fields, and most of the already formed summer bolls were lost, but they strengthened the later stage management, and ultimately, they still achieved very high yields. Of course, increasing the production of high-quality frost-before flowers is undoubtedly our main task, but increasing the production of lower-quality frost-after flowers as much as possible is also of great significance to meeting the production and living needs of the Chinese people. In particular, most of the early autumn bolls are still of good quality. Therefore, on the premise of ensuring a high-magnitude increase in the production of frost-before flowers, increasing the production of some frost-after flowers, increasing wealth for the country, and increasing income for the communes is a good thing that benefits all parties.

Increasing fertilizer application is an urgent task for strengthening cotton field management at present, because this is the material basis for ensuring summer bolls and striving for more autumn bolls. After the peak period of cotton flowering and boll formation during the hot summer, most of the absorbable nutrients in the soil have been absorbed and utilized by the cotton plants. It is necessary to provide the cotton with sufficient nutrients again in order to promote the later stage of cotton to produce more buds, open more flowers, and form more bolls. According to a typical survey in Handan, Hebei: those who applied an appropriate amount of boll fertilizer in early August increased the yield of seed cotton by 24 jin per mu compared to those who did not apply fertilizer. There is also such a situation in Jianyang, Sichuan. Those who applied boll fertilizer in mid-August in this county also increased the yield of seed cotton by 28 jin to 56 jin compared to those who did not apply fertilizer. All cotton-producing areas should boldly promote these creative advanced experiences according to local conditions.

At present, drought has occurred in most cotton-growing areas of the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin. In this way, the applied fertilizer cannot fully function. Therefore, making full use of the existing water conservancy construction in cotton-growing areas to carry out appropriate irrigation has a great effect on ensuring summer bolls and increasing autumn bolls. Flooding is also often a major cause of reduced cotton harvests. The reduction in cotton production in 1954 and 1956 was affected by flooding. Therefore, while fighting drought, it is also necessary to clear drainage ditches. We should inspect them piece by piece and urge all communes and production teams to earnestly prepare for flood drainage. In addition, the coastal cotton-growing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also in the season of typhoon hazards in August and September. We must be vigilant against these threats of autumn flooding, autumn drought, and typhoons, actively exert revolutionary vigor, and strive for a bumper harvest despite drought and flood.

Consolidating summer bolls and increasing autumn bolls must also be combined with an unremitting struggle against insect pests. Autumn is still a period of widespread harm from red bollworms, cotton bollworms, leaf rollers, beet armyworms, and spider mites. If we are negligent in prevention and control, not only will autumn bolls be difficult to protect, but the already formed summer bolls will also be greatly threatened, which will make all yield increase measures fail. We should strengthen insect situation inspection, do a good job in forecasting and early warning work, and because the prevention and control of insect pests has reached the final tense stage, we must do a good job in adjusting the surplus and deficiency of medicines and machinery so that this year's pesticides can fully play their role. If there is insufficient western medicine, we should use local pesticides and local methods for prevention and control.

Last year, many cotton-growing areas appropriately postponed the topping time of cotton with the change of production conditions such as fertilizer and water. This was to make full use of the growing season and strive for more autumn bolls. Facts have proved that this approach was successful. For example, in Haocun Production Brigade, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, the cotton fields topped on August 8 had an average of about seven more effective cotton bolls per plant than those topped on July 27. However, appropriate postponement of topping should also have a certain limit, and it is not the later the better. Last year, some areas postponed the topping period too late, or did not top at all, which was not right. It is necessary to calculate the effective growth period of budding, flowering, and boll formation according to the early or late date of the local first frost; then look at the growth of cotton plants, soil fertility, and the amount of supplementary fertilizer applied, and estimate the nutrient supply conditions for late budding and boll formation, to determine the appropriate time for topping. If the above principles are not well grasped, early topping will of course lose a batch of useful cotton bolls and cannot meet the requirements of more autumn bolls. However, topping too late or not topping will also increase some ineffective buds and bolls, waste nutrients, and instead be detrimental to the development of middle and late stage cotton bolls. In cotton fields with more fertilizer, sufficient water, and high density, carrying out pruning work such as removing large leaves and cutting off empty branches in the later stage can reduce cotton field shading, which also has a certain effect on increasing autumn bolls and preventing rotten bolls.

Now is the final opportunity to strive for a bumper cotton harvest. All cotton-growing areas must earnestly do a good job in organizational work, arrange the labor force for managing cotton fields, and strengthen the later stage management of cotton fields. Recently, many areas have convened cotton on-site meetings, put forward the combat slogan of "management will not stop until the cotton is harvested," and determined corresponding production increase measures. This is very good. I wish the cadres and masses in the cotton-producing areas of the country, in the battle to ensure summer bolls and increase autumn bolls, to go all out, aim high, and once again seize a new great victory.

### 确保伏桃，多结秋桃，争取棉花大丰收

　　确保伏桃，多结秋桃，争取棉花大丰收
    6月16日本报曾发表“抓住棉花增产的关键”的社论，提出了提高棉花单位面积产量的办法是：力促棉苗早发育、早开花、早结桃和多结伏前桃和伏桃；然后在保住伏桃的基础上，再争取多结秋桃。从目前各地反映的情况看来，大部棉田开花结桃比去年提早，做到了“带桃入伏”。河南省新乡专区四百万亩棉田，就有一半以上的棉田作到了每株结伏前桃四至五个，三分之一棉田作到了结伏前桃二至三个，这是争取今年棉花大丰收的一个重大胜利。但是要使棉花大丰收，还要做许多工作，当前最重要的一个工作是确保伏桃，多结秋桃。
    棉花丰收的关键是桃多桃大。达到桃多桃大的方法，就是充分利用棉花的生长期不停地加强田间管理。在棉田前期田间管理过去以后，就要及时地加强后期管理。这样做，一方面可以促使已结的伏桃减少脱落，长成为大桃，成熟吐絮；另一方面争取棉株在可能的范围内，再现更多的蕾，开更多的花，结更多的桃，做到一株结的桃等于过去两株的桃。这是完全有可能做到的。据农业科学研究部门调查：黄河流域主要棉区，到初霜期还有六十天到八十天的期间；长江流域棉区，到回茬种麦，还有八十天的期间。因此，加强这个时期的管理，就可以结更多的棉桃。如果一株棉花多结两、三个棉桃，按每亩四千株计算，一亩可以多收十几斤皮棉，全国就可以增产一千多万担皮棉。如果放松了这一期间的田间管理工作，那就会前功尽弃，不仅秋桃结的少，就是已结的伏桃也可能受到损失。
    也许有人会有这样的看法：“棉花一过立秋，没有多大油水了”，“伏前桃和伏桃结得不少了，不必再争取多结秋桃，棉花就可丰收了”，“霜后花没有霜前花好”。这些看法都是不正确的。1958年全国棉花获得大丰产就是破除了过去认为追肥不能晚于7月中旬、后期不能灌溉等清规戒律，加强了棉田的后期管理的结果。其实，就是在前期管理不善或者由于灾害，伏桃结得少的棉田，只要努力争取多结秋桃，棉花产量仍然能够提高。去年湖北麻城县，在8月中旬大部棉田遭受洪水涝灾，已结的伏桃大部损失，但是他们加强了后期管理，最后，仍然获得了很高的产量。当然，增产质量好的霜前花无疑是我们的主要任务，但是尽可能地提高质量较次的霜后花，对于满足我国人民生产和生活的需要来说，也同样有着很大的意义。特别是前期秋桃大部还是质量较好的棉花。因此，在确保霜前花高幅度增产的前提下，再增产一些霜后花，给国家增加财富，为公社增加收入，这是一件一举两得的好事情。
    增施肥料是当前加强棉花田间管理的一个紧急任务，因为这是确保伏桃争取多结秋桃的物质基础。经过暑伏期间棉花开花结桃盛期，土壤中可吸收的养料已大部被棉株吸收利用，必须再供给棉花充足的养料，才能够促使棉花后期多现蕾多开花多结桃。据河北邯郸的典型调查：凡是在8月上旬增施适量桃肥的，比不施肥的每亩增产籽棉二十四斤。四川简阳也有这样的情况，这个县8月中旬增施了桃肥的，也比不施的增产籽棉二十八斤至五十六斤。各个产棉区都应该因地制宜地大胆推行这些创造性的先进经验。
    目前，黄河流域和长江流域的大部分棉区发生了干旱现象。这样，所施的肥料不能充分发挥作用，因此，充分利用棉区已有的水利建设，进行适当的灌溉，对确保伏桃、多结秋桃，有很大的作用。涝灾也常是造成棉花歉收的主要原因，1954年和1956年棉花减产，就是受到了涝灾影响。因此在抗旱的同时，还要清理排水沟道。应该逐片逐块检查，督促各公社、生产队切实做好排涝准备。此外，江、浙沿海棉区，8、9两月又正是台风为害季节，对这些秋涝、秋旱和台风的威胁，必须加以警惕，积极发挥革命干劲，力争旱涝保丰收。
    巩固伏桃，多结秋桃，还必须与虫害进行不懈的斗争。秋季仍是红铃虫、棉铃虫、卷叶虫、斜纹夜蛾和叶?虫等蔓延为害时期，如果疏于防范，不仅是秋桃难保，对已结的伏桃也是很大威胁，会使一切增产措施功亏一篑。应该加强虫情检查，做好预测预报工作，由于防治虫害已到最后的紧张阶段，更要作好药械的余缺调剂工作，使今年的农药充分发挥作用，洋药不足的应采用土农药和土法进行防治。
    去年不少棉区随着肥、水等生产条件的改变，适当推迟了棉花的打顶时间。这是为了充分利用生长期，争取多结秋桃。事实证明，这个作法是成功的。例如河南省新乡县郝村生产大队，8月8日打顶的棉田比7月27日打顶的平均每株多结有效棉桃七个左右。但是适当推迟打顶也应有一定的限度，并不是愈晚愈好。去年有些地区把打顶时期推迟过晚，或者不打顶，都是不对的。要根据当地初霜期的迟早，推算现蕾、开花，结桃的有效生育时期；然后再看棉株生长情况，土壤肥力和追肥多少，估计后期现蕾，结桃的养料供应条件，来确定适时打顶的时间。不掌握好上述原则，早打顶当然要损失一批有用的棉桃，不能达到多结秋桃的要求。但是过晚打顶或不打顶，也会增加一些无效的蕾铃，徒耗养分，反而对中后期棉桃的发育不利。在肥多、水足、密度较大的棉田，后期进行打大叶、剪空枝等整枝工作，可以减轻棉田荫蔽，对多结秋桃，防止烂桃，也有一定作用。
    现在已是争取棉花丰产的最后时机，所有棉区都必须切实做好组织工作，安排好管理棉田的劳力，加强棉田的后期管理。最近很多地区召开了棉花现场会议，提出了“棉花不收，管理不停”的战斗口号，并确定了相应的增产措施。这是很好的。祝全国产棉区的干部和群众，在确保伏桃，多结秋桃的战斗中，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再一次夺取新的伟大的胜利。
