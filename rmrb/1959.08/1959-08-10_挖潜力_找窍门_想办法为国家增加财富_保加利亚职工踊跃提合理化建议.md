Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: Since Bulgaria launched a vigorous leap forward movement to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three to four years, the broad masses of workers across the country have enthusiastically put forward various rationalization and innovation proposals for increasing production and practicing economy. In the first five months of this year alone, the rationalization proposals they put forward were more than double the total for the past eight years and more than eleven times that of the entire year of 1958.

At present, the number of rationalization proposers and inventors in Bulgaria has reached more than 100,000. In the movement to carry out rationalization proposals, they have formed various rationalization proposal work teams to jointly tap potential, find tricks, and think of ways. In the first five months of this year, they put forward more than 400,000 rationalization proposals and inventions. It is estimated that the adoption of these new proposals will increase the country's wealth by more than 350 million leva.

Rationalization proposals and inventions have become a driving force in Bulgaria's industry for reforming technology, improving labor productivity, and promoting production, and they have significant economic value. For example, the Khristo Bochev Spinning Factory in Varna City rebuilt medium-sized coarse spinning machines, doubling the output per shift. While reducing the labor force by half, it can produce an additional 1.8 million kilograms of yarn annually. By improving the nippers of 30 "Asalio" ring spinning frames, the factory's workers were able to reduce yarn breakage by 10% and increase the machine's operating speed by 500 revolutions per minute, thereby increasing labor productivity by more than 8%.

The design personnel of the Sofia enterprises saved more than 800,000 leva by proposing suggestions when creating a new type of sulfuric acid refrigerator in the Damyanov Copper Smelting Plant; mechanic Volkov saved 440,000 leva by improving the running parts of the "КД—35" tractor. The straw board factory in Pleven City recently used high-quality resin to produce a new building material—straw board, which has good heat and moisture resistance and is seven times cheaper than wood.

In addition, rationalization proposers are also thinking of ways to manufacture and use various new industrial materials to replace expensive metal materials. For example, the workers and engineers of the Nai Den Kirov Electrical Equipment Factory in Ruse City have, after long-term experiments, developed a new metal substitute—structural plastic. The weight of this plastic is only about one-sixth that of steel and bronze, it is cheaper than them, and it has high mechanical strength and is not corroded by chemical action. They can not only be used as substitutes for metal parts, but also can be used to manufacture many new products. The boiler manufacturing workers of the Dimitrov Factory in Sofia used steel instead of copper and recently manufactured Bulgaria's first steel firebox for a train locomotive, costing only one-tenth of a copper firebox.

### 挖潜力　找窍门　想办法为国家增加财富  保加利亚职工踊跃提合理化建议

    挖潜力　找窍门　想办法为国家增加财富
    保加利亚职工踊跃提合理化建议
    新华社索非亚讯　自从保加利亚轰轰烈烈地开展在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划的跃进运动以来，全国广大职工踊跃提出种种增产节约的合理化和革新建议。在今年头五个月里，他们所提出的合理化建议就比过去八年多一倍，比1958年全年多十一倍以上。
    目前，保加利亚的合理化建议者和发明家的人数已达十万名以上，在开展合理化建议的运动中，他们组成了各种合理化建议工作队，来共同挖潜力、找窍门、想办法。在今年头五个月，他们提出了四十万项以上的合理化建议和发明。据估计，由于采用这些新建议，将为国家增加三亿五千万列弗以上的财富。
    合理化建议和发明已经成为了保加利亚工业中改革技术、提高劳动生产率和推动生产的动力，并且具有重大的经济价值。例如，瓦尔纳市的赫里斯托·鲍切夫纺纱厂改建中型粗纺机，使每班产量增加了一倍，在减少一半劳动力的情况下，每年能多生产一百八十万公斤纱。这个厂的职工由于改进三十台“阿萨利奥”环锭精纺机拑口，可以减少断纱次数10％，并且每分钟把机器的运转数提高了五百转，使劳动生产率提高了8％以上。
    索非亚企业的设计人员在达米扬诺夫制铜联合厂创造新型硫酸冷藏器时所提出的建议，节约了八十多万列弗；机械师沃尔科夫改进“КД—35式”拖拉机的行进部件，节约了四十四万列弗。普列文市秸草板工厂最近利用优质树脂制成新的建筑材料——秸草板，其耐热、耐潮性能很好，并且比木料便宜七倍。
    此外，合理化建议者还想办法造制和利用各种新的工业材料来代替价值昂贵的金属材料。例如，鲁西市的纳伊坚·基罗夫电工器材厂的工人和工程师经过长期试验，制成了新的金属代用品——结构塑料。这种塑料的重量大约只抵钢和青铜的六分之一，比它们便宜，而且具有高度的机械牢固性，不受化学作用的侵蚀。它们不但可以用作金属零件的代用品，而且也可以用来制造许多新产品。索非亚季米特洛夫工厂的锅炉制造工人用钢来代替铜，在最近制成了保加利亚的第一个火车机车的钢制火室，造价仅低铜制火室的十分之一。
