Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yi, Cheng Sheng

This reporter spent forty days in the Dongjiang disaster area of Guangdong Province, witnessing and hearing countless moving stories of the People's Liberation Army helping people in flood fighting and disaster relief.

A Boatload of Biscuits

This story happened during the flood. One day, more than ten soldiers received an urgent mission to use a small boat to deliver three thousand catties of biscuits to a disaster-stricken people's settlement dozens of miles away. More than two thousand people there were in danger of running out of food. Before departure, these soldiers had been busy rescuing disaster victims and had not eaten anything for twelve hours. After departure, the wind was strong, the waves were high, and the rain was heavy, so the rubber boat moved very slowly, traveling only twenty kilometers in ten hours. At this time, hunger tormented every soldier, and with their whole bodies soaked, their strength was almost exhausted. However, all twelve soldiers in the boat, under the leadership of the platoon leader, faced a boatload of biscuits, smelling the bursts of biscuit fragrance, but no one was willing to eat a single piece. Later, several young soldiers were so hungry that they were about to faint. The platoon leader took out a package of biscuits and handed it to them. They stared ahead, thinking about the disaster victims who were waiting for these biscuits, passing the package of biscuits back and forth, and then putting it back as it was. They then began to sing loudly to dilute the feeling of hunger and tried their best to paddle forward, finally delivering the boatload of biscuits to the victims.

Riverbank Restoration Shock Brigade

After the flood in Dongjiang, the PLA's flood fighting and rescue team quickly became a shock brigade to help people restore the riverbanks. Many breaches in the Dongjiang Dam opened by the flood urgently needed to be closed. The PLA soldiers appeared on the most difficult sections of the dike. In the Masidi section of Yuanzhouwei in Boluo County, a PLA riverbank restoration shock brigade assisted civilian workers in closing a large breach and building a new dike more than 900 meters long.

This large breach was particularly severely eroded by the flood, and the water was still over one's head in the early stages of construction. Many local farmers were worried that the breach could not be closed in the short term. At this time, the PLA sent a shock brigade of more than two thousand people to take on the task of the most difficult dike section. Wearing wet shorts and vests, they ran carrying earth in the face of the oncoming gale, rain, and flying sand. Many people's shoulders were swollen, and some people's feet were injured by broken tiles, bamboo thorns, and nails hidden in the accumulated water, but no one cried out in pain. When others advised them to rest, they said: "Minor injuries will never take us off the front line!" Communist Party member Wang Jinliu suffered from dysentery but concealed it from others and insisted on carrying earth every day. The instructor discovered that he was ill and repeatedly urged him to go back to rest. He said, "What does this little illness matter? It is most important to repair the dam as soon as possible so that the folks can plant rice early and have a good harvest!" It wasn't until the instructor ordered him to stop work and go back to rest that he returned to the shed.

At another breach closure construction site on the dam, Deputy Division Commander Wang Liangru, who was in charge of the construction, was as active on the dam as a young soldier all day long, either pointing out the construction, studying engineering problems, or participating in carrying earth. One day, a sudden storm made it impossible to even place a teacup steadily inside the construction site tent. Outside the tent, the wind, sand, and rain stung people's eyes, and people advised Deputy Division Commander Wang to rest, but he wore his soaking wet clothes and took the lead in carrying earth. Instructor Zhang Yi, who once led a heroic company to attack the enemy on the Korean battlefield and still has a shrapnel in his chest that has not been removed, also insisted on fighting in the dike restoration position.

An Argument

Now, many sections of the most difficult breach closure and dike restoration projects in Dongjiang have been repaired. Some dike sections have just been repaired and have been named "Army-Civilian Friendship Dikes" by the local people. The people of Yuanzhouwei are very grateful for the support of the PLA and have asked the local Party committee and government to name the dike "Gratitude Dike." They said that in our most difficult and dangerous times, the PLA risked their lives and endured hunger and cold to rescue us. After the flood receded, they helped us repair the dike, plant rice, deliver fertilizer, plow the fields, restore production, and rebuild our homes. We will never forget the kindness of the Party and the PLA. The officers and soldiers who participated in the dike repair repeatedly expressed their disagreement with this naming. They explained to the people: "It is entirely right for the people's soldiers to serve the people's happiness and the socialist construction of the motherland. How can the people be grateful to their own soldiers!"

    解放军在东江抗洪救灾中
    新华社记者　陈逸、程生
    记者在广东省的东江灾区，生活了四十天，目睹耳闻了数不尽的解放军在帮助人民抗洪救灾中的动人故事。
    一船饼干
    这故事发生在洪水期间。有一天，十多名战士接到一个紧急任务，要用小船把三千斤饼干送到几十里外的一个灾民聚居点去。那里有两千多群众有断粮的危险。出发前，这批战士忙于抢救灾民，已足有十二个钟头没吃过东西了。出发后，一路上风急、浪大、雨猛，橡皮艇前进得很慢，十个小时才前进了二十公里。这时，饥饿煎熬着每个战士，加上全身湿透，力气也快用尽了。但是，全船十二个战士在排长领导下，面对着一船的饼干，闻着阵阵扑来的饼干香味，却始终没有一个人愿意吃下一块。后来，有几个青年战士饿得快要晕倒了。排长拿出一包饼干，递到他们面前。他们眼望着前面，心里惦念着正在等待这些饼干的灾民，把那包饼干传来传去，又把它原样放回。他们这时引吭高歌起来，借此冲淡饥饿的感觉，并尽力划桨前进，终于把一船饼干送到灾民手中。
    复堤突击队
    东江洪水过后，这里的解放军抗洪抢险队，很快的又变成了帮助人民复堤的突击队了。东江大堤给洪水打开的好多决口，急待堵复。解放军的战士们出现在堵口复堤最艰巨的堤段上。在博罗县园州围的马嘶堤段，解放军的一支复堤突击队，协助民工把一个大决口堵复，筑起了一段九百多米长的新堤。
    这个大决口被洪水冲刷得特别厉害，施工初期还水深过人。当地许多农民都耽心短期内不能堵好这个决口。这时，解放军开来了一支两千多人的突击队，把最困难的堤段任务包了下来。他们穿着湿透了的裤叉、背心，在迎面打来的狂风、雨点、飞沙中挑土奔跑。许多人肩膀压肿了，有些人给藏在积水中的破瓦片、竹刺、钉子扎伤了脚底，可是谁也不叫痛。别人劝他们休息，他们说：“轻伤决不下火线！”共产党员王金流患痢疾，却瞒着人天天坚持挑土。指导员发现了他有病，几次劝他回去休息。他却说：“这点病算得什么？早日修好大堤，好让老乡们早插秧，早丰收，才是最要紧的事啊！”直到指导员下命令要他停工回去休息，他才回到工棚。
    在大堤的另一个堵口工地上，指挥施工的副师长王良如也跟一个青年战士一样，整天活跃在堤上，不是指点着施工，研究工程问题，就是参加挑土。一天，急风暴雨，工地帐篷内连茶杯也放不稳。帐篷外，风沙、雨水打得人眼睛发疼，人们劝王副师长休息，但他却穿着透湿的衣服，带头挑土。教导员张仪，曾在朝鲜战场上领着一个英雄连打击敌人，至今胸部还有一块弹片没有取出来，也坚持战斗在复堤岗位上。
    一场争执
    现在，东江所有最艰巨的堵口复堤工程的不少堤段都已修复了。有些堤段刚修复，就被当地人民命名为“军民友谊堤”。园州围的人民十分感激解放军的支援，要求当地党委和政府把堤围命名为“感恩堤”。他们说，在我们最困难最危险的时候，解放军冒生命危险、忍饥耐寒地抢救我们，洪水退后，又帮助我们修堤、插秧、送肥、犁田，恢复生产，重建家园，党和解放军的这个恩情我们永远也不能忘记。参加修堤的军官和战士却再三表示不同意这个命名。他们向人民解释说：“人民子弟兵为保卫人民的幸福，为祖国的社会主义建设事业服务这完全是应该的，那有人民对自己的子弟感恩的道理呢！”（附图片）
