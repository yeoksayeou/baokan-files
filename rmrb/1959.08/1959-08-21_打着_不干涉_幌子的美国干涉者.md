    American Interventionists Under the Guise of "Non-Interference"
　　Zhang Ye
    U.S. Secretary of State Herter shamelessly uses the guise of "non-interference" to plot conspiracies to interfere in the situation in Cuba and the Caribbean region. The results of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas fully exposed this fact. The ferocious American interventionists have to disguise themselves as "defenders" of the "non-interference" principle this time because the situation is very unfavorable to them. However, the ugly face of American imperialism, which has a bloody history of more than 100 years of infiltration, aggression and plunder of Latin America, cannot be concealed.
    Old-Line Interventionist
    For a long time, the United States has treated Latin American countries with the domineering attitude of a colonial country. U.S. imperialism has always been the common enemy of Latin American countries and a brutal interferer and aggressor against them. Taking its aggression and interference in Cuba as an example, it almost runs through the history of American aggression in Latin America. As early as 1825, when the Spanish colonialists wanted to sell Cuba to France, U.S. Secretary of State Adams publicly declared that Cuba and Puerto Rico were "natural appendages" of the North American continent, and "...the incorporation of Cuba into our Union is essential to the continuation and integrity of the Union itself." In 1898, the United States went to war with Spain, which was the first war of an imperialist nature. At that time, the Cuban people's anti-Spanish colonial war was about to achieve final victory, but the United States intervened, defeated Spain, occupied Cuba, and forced Cuba to accept the "Platt Amendment" as part of the Cuban Constitution in 1901. This amendment stipulated that the United States had the right to exercise intervention in Cuba, Cuba had to accept U.S. military occupation and financial supervision, and the United States also obtained two naval bases in Cuba. Later, although the U.S. occupying forces withdrew from Cuba and abolished the above-mentioned amendment, the United States not only occupied Cuba's bases, but also exercised control and plunder over Cuba through the dictatorial regime it cultivated. In 1933, when Cuba established a relatively democratic San Martin government, it immediately aroused the intervention of thirty U.S. warships. Now, when the consistent enemy of the Cuban people, American imperialism, is once again blatantly planning to oppose and interfere in Cuba, the guise of "non-interference" it is using appears particularly ugly.
    Let's look at other Latin American countries, none of which have not suffered American aggression and interference. The "Monroe Doctrine" announced by U.S. President Monroe in 1823 was the robber doctrine of the United States to exclude Western European colonial countries and dominate the Americas. Monroe's declaration also carried the banner of "non-interference," but that was openly referring to not allowing Western European colonialists to gain a foothold in the Americas, while declaring that the United States was the protector of "any part of the Western Hemisphere." Soon after the "Monroe Doctrine" was announced, Cuba and Mexico became the primary targets of American expansion. The United States prevented Britain's coveting of Mexico in 1843, while the United States itself used force in 1836, 1844, and 1846-1848 to force Mexico to give more than half of its territory to the United States. These places are now part of Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming in the United States.
    After this, the claws of the United States continued to extend into Latin America. From 1855 to 1860, the American pirate William Walker invaded Central America, and the U.S. government actually recognized him as the president of Nicaragua in 1857. In 1856, a revolution broke out in Panama (then belonging to Colombia), and the U.S. Marines landed under the pretext of "protecting American interests." In 1885, U.S. troops occupied most of the canal area and Panama City. In 1890, an uprising occurred in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and in 1893-1894, a civil war occurred in Brazil. The United States sent fleets to intervene and frantically suppress the revolution.
    Expansion of Intervention and Aggression Activities
    The war between the United States and Spain in 1898 was a milestone in the United States basically gaining political hegemony in Latin America. At that time, Spain had become weak and不堪, while the United States had become an imperialist country eager to expand outwards. As a result of the Spanish-American War, the United States occupied Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. From then on, the United States intensified its aggression and interference activities in Latin America, especially after the establishment of the "Commercial Bureau of American Republics" in 1890, which was renamed the "Pan American Union" in 1910 (later reorganized into the "Organization of American States"). This was the period when Theodore Roosevelt was promoting the so-called "big stick policy." He openly declared that the United States enjoyed the "international police power" in the Western Hemisphere. During his tenure, he established control over many countries in the Caribbean region. The most notorious of these was the conspiracy to create Panama's independence from Colombia in 1903-1904. Subsequently, the United States obtained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone. During Taft's administration, he advocated the so-called policy of "using dollars instead of bullets," which was actually an expansion with both dollars and force. During his tenure, he implemented financial intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1907, and the United States established a "Tax Bureau" in this country. In 1909, he severed relations with Nicaragua and carried out armed intervention. When Wilson came to power, he continued to adopt a policy of armed intervention in Latin America, the most prominent of which was the armed intervention in Mexico. At that time, the Mexican people were carrying out a profound bourgeois democratic revolution, which set off a struggle against the rule of large estate systems, churches, and monopoly organizations. In 1916, Wilson sent General Pershing on a "punitive" expedition to invade Mexico and directly interfere in the Mexican revolution, and did not withdraw his troops until 1917. In addition, Wilson also sent troops to occupy Nicaragua in 1914; launched an armed attack on Haiti in 1915, occupying Haiti for nineteen years; and comprehensively armed intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1916, establishing a "Dominican government" composed of American officers. During President Harding's term, American troops massacred more than three thousand peaceful residents in Haiti. During President Coolidge's term, the United States sent an infantry to intervene for the third time in Nicaragua's national liberation movement in 1926, and occupied the country until 1933. During Hoover's term
  (1928-1932), many countries in Central and South America were under American military occupation or armed surveillance.
    After the 1930s, the economic crisis in the capitalist world greatly weakened the United States' position in the world. The result of the United States' policy of both dollars and force in Latin America made the political and economic relations between the United States and Latin America increasingly tense. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt at the time proposed the so-called "Good Neighbor Policy" in order to ease this tension and consolidate and expand its control over Latin American countries. However, even throughout the "Good Neighbor Policy" period, the United States did not abandon its intervention in the internal affairs and military aggression against Latin American countries. During this period, the United States tried its best to support dictators to come to power, support all the reactionary measures of dictatorial governments, and crack down on the national democratic forces in this region. For example, Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Martinez in El Salvador, and Ubico in Guatemala were all dictators supported by the United States to come to power.
    Three Vicious Intervention Methods
    World War II had a profound impact on Latin America. In the late stages of the war and the initial years after the war, the people's movement in Latin America was encouraged by the victory of the anti-fascist struggle, and was quite active in the political life of many countries. In some countries, democratic forces and political forces with progressive tendencies had replaced dictatorial regimes, such as the armed uprising in Guatemala in 1944 that overthrew the Ubico dictatorship, the victory of the Popular Front in Chile in the 1946 elections, the victory of the democratic forces in Venezuela in the 1947 elections, and the establishment of a regime headed by the famous writer Gallegos, followed shortly by the armed uprising of the Bolivian people in April 1952, which overthrew the Baivian dictatorship. Progressive forces in other countries such as Brazil, Cuba, and Uruguay also achieved significant success in the elections. U.S. imperialism did not hesitate to further tear off its "Good Neighbor Policy" cloak, openly appearing as a world gendarme, and using various despicable means to strangle democracy, freedom, and national independence in Latin American countries. On the one hand, it established a military system in the Western Hemisphere through the "Organization of American States"; on the other hand, it adopted different methods according to different objects to support dictatorial regimes, destroy democratic forces, and strangle national independence movements.
    Among the practices adopted by the United States, there are mainly the following three types. First, forcing some new regimes that have gained the support of progressive forces to turn to the right in order to control these countries. One example of this is the Chilean Videla regime, which came to power in 1946 with the support of the Popular Front, and betrayed the Popular Front in order to accept a U.S. loan of 50 million US dollars. Another example is the Argentine Frondizi regime, which proposed a relatively progressive program during the election, and therefore won the support of the people and was elected in 1958. In order to obtain a loan of 329 million US dollars from the "International Monetary Fund" controlled by the United States and American banks, it accepted the "economic stabilization plan" that harmed national and people's interests, and completely abandoned the election program and became increasingly right-wing and backward.
    Second, replacing regimes that have slightly resisted or expressed dissatisfaction with the United States with the most reactionary pro-American and traitorous dictatorial regimes. The suicide of Brazilian President Vargas in August 1954 is the most obvious example. Vargas was originally brought to power by the United States, and in the early stages of his rule, he implemented policies that served American monopoly capital. Later, due to the rise of the Brazilian people's movement, Vargas was forced to take some restrictive measures against American monopoly capital groups, such as the establishment of the state-monopolized "Brazilian Petroleum Company" and plans to confiscate foreign power companies, etc. American monopoly capital groups then instigated a coup and forced Vargas to commit suicide.
    Third, implementing direct armed intervention. The most prominent example of this is the well-known Guatemalan incident in 1954. The reason why coups in other Latin American countries have occurred one after another is also the result of the United States plotting behind the scenes. According to statistics, from 1948 to 1958, in the decade, there were as many as eighteen major subversive events in Latin American countries by the United States.
    The Guatemalan Incident Must Not Be Repeated
    Since the Cuban Revolution, the activities of U.S. imperialism in interfering in Cuba and the Caribbean region have been particularly frantic, because the Cuban Revolution has most dramatically shaken the colonial foundation of the United States in Latin America, and most powerfully promoted the national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin America, and anti-dictatorial armed uprisings have broken out in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. In addition to repeatedly using Cuba's traitorous reactionary forces to carry out subversive activities, and organizing armed forces in Miami in the United States and in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Haiti to prepare to invade Cuba, the United States convened the recently concluded Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas as the first step in armed intervention. Under the manipulation and pressure of the United States, some resolutions passed at the meeting are conducive to American intervention activities. It can intervene in the internal affairs of countries in the Caribbean region, oppose the Cuban Revolution and the Latin American national democratic movement by authorizing the so-called Pan-American "Peace Committee" to "review" the tense situation in the region and supervise the activities of various countries.
    However, the era of U.S. imperialism doing whatever it wants in Latin America is over. The revolutionary unity of the Cuban people and the Cuban people's firm determination to oppose American interference, the unanimous unity and mutual support of the people of Latin American countries, as well as the support of world public opinion and progressive forces for the Cuban Revolution, have and will powerfully strike at the American interventionist conspiracy. The reason why the United States was not completely successful at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas shows that under the situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the people of Latin America can prevent the repetition of the 1954 Guatemalan incident.

    打着“不干涉”幌子的美国干涉者
　　章叶
    美国国务卿赫脱厚颜无耻地打着“不干涉”的幌子，策划干涉古巴和加勒比海地区局势的阴谋。美洲外长会议的结果，完全暴露了这一事实。凶恶的美国干涉者这回所以不得不伪装成“不干涉”原则的“捍卫者”，是因为形势对它十分不利。然而，这个有着一百多年渗透、侵略和掠夺拉丁美洲的血腥史的美帝国主义面目是掩盖不了的。
    老牌干涉者
    长期以来，美国就用殖民国家的专横态度对待拉丁美洲各国。美帝国主义从来就是拉丁美洲各国的共同敌人，是拉丁美洲各国的粗暴的干涉者和侵略者。拿它对古巴的侵略和干涉来说，就几乎贯穿着美国侵略拉丁美洲的历史。远在1825年，西班牙殖民者想把古巴卖给法国的时候，美国国务卿亚当士就公然声明，古巴和波多黎各是北美大陆的“天然附属品，而且……把古巴并入我们联邦的版图对于联邦本身的延续和完整是有必要的。”1898年美国同西班牙发生战争，这是帝国主义性质的第一次战争。当时古巴人民正在进行的反西班牙殖民战争将取得最后胜利，美国竟插手干预，打败了西班牙，占领了古巴，并迫使古巴在1901年接受“普拉特修正案”作为古巴宪法的一部分，这个修正案规定美国对古巴有行使干涉之权，古巴必须接受美国的军事占领和财政监督，另外美国还取得古巴两处海军基地。后来美国占领军虽然撤出了古巴，并废除了上述修正案，但美国不仅霸占着古巴的基地，而且通过它一手扶植的独裁政权对古巴实行控制和掠夺。1933年古巴曾成立比较民主的圣马丁政府，立即引起美国三十只军舰的干涉。现在，古巴人民的一贯死敌美帝国主义再次露骨地策划敌视和干涉古巴的时候，打出的“不干涉”幌子，就显得特别丑恶。
    再请看，其他的拉丁美洲国家，哪一个没有遭受美国的侵略和干涉。1823年美国总统门罗宣布的“门罗主义”，就是美国排斥西欧殖民国家、独霸美洲的强盗主义。门罗的宣言也打着“不干涉”的旗号，但那是公开指的是不许西欧殖民者在美洲立足，而却宣布美国是“西半球任何部分”的保护者。“门罗主义”宣布不久，古巴和墨西哥就成了美国扩张的首要对象。美国在1843年制止了英国对墨西哥的垂涎，而美国自己却在1836年、1844年、1846—1848年用武力迫使墨西哥把一半以上的领土给予美国，这些地方就是现在美国的得克萨斯、加利福尼亚、亚利桑那、内华达、犹他、新墨西哥、科罗拉多和怀俄明的一部分。
    在这以后，美国的魔爪继续伸入拉丁美洲。1855—1860年，美国海盗威廉·沃克侵入中美洲，美国政府竟在1857年承认他是尼加拉瓜的总统。1856年，巴拿马（当时属于哥伦比亚）爆发革命，美国海军陆战队借口“保护美国利益”登陆，1885年，美国军队占领了运河大部地区和巴拿马城。1890年阿根廷的布宜诺斯艾利斯发生起义和1893—1894年巴西的内战，美国都曾派遣舰队出面干涉，疯狂地镇压革命。
    干涉和侵略活动的扩大
    1898年美国同西班牙的战争是美国在拉丁美洲基本上取得政治霸权的一个界碑。当时西班牙已经衰弱不堪，而美国却成了一个急于向外扩张的帝国主义国家。美西战争的结果，美国占领了古巴、波多黎各和菲律宾。从这以后美国更加紧了它对拉丁美洲的侵略和干涉活动。特别是在1890年成立“美洲各国商务局”、1910年改称“泛美联盟”（后来又改组为“美洲国家组织”）的机构以后。这时正是西奥多·罗斯福推行所谓“大棒政策”时期。他公开宣称美国在西半球享有“国际警卫权”。在他的任内，建立了对加勒比海地区许多国家的控制权。其中最臭名昭彰的是在1903—1904年制造的巴拿马脱离哥伦比亚独立的阴谋事件。随后美国取得了巴拿马运河区的主权。到了塔虎脱执政时期，又倡导所谓“用金元代替枪弹”的政策，实际上是金元与武力双管齐下地进行扩张。在他的任内，曾于1907年对多米尼加共和国实行财政干涉，美国在这个国家建立了“税务局”，1909年断绝同尼加拉瓜的关系，并且进行武装干涉。到威尔逊上台，继续对拉丁美洲采取武装干涉的政策，最突出的是对墨西哥的武装干涉。当时墨西哥人民正在进行深刻的资产阶级民主革命，掀起了反对大庄园制度、教会和垄断组织统治的斗争。 1916年，威尔逊随派帕欣将军进行“惩罚性”的远征，入侵墨西哥，直接干涉墨西哥革命，直到1917年才撤回军队。此外，威尔逊还在1914年派兵占领尼加拉瓜；1915年对海地实行武装进攻，占领海地达十九年之久；1916年全面地武装干涉多米尼加共和国，成立了一个由美国军官组成的“多米尼加政府”。在哈定总统任期内，美国军队在海地屠杀了三千以上的和平居民。在柯立芝总统任期内，美国于1926年派了一支步兵第三次武装干涉尼加拉瓜的民族解放运动，并且占领了这个国家直到1933年。在胡佛任内
  （1928—1932年），中南美洲许多国家都处在美国军事占领或武装监视之下。
    二十世纪三十年代以后，资本主义世界发生的经济危机，大大削弱了美国在世界上的地位。美国在拉丁美洲推行的金元和武力双管齐下政策的结果，使美国同拉丁美洲之间的政治和经济关系变得日趋紧张。当时的美国总统佛兰克林·罗斯福为了缓和这种紧张关系，巩固和扩大它对拉丁美洲各国的控制，提出了所谓“善邻政策”。但是，即使是在整个“善邻政策”时期，美国也没有放弃它对拉丁美洲国家的内政干涉和军事侵略。在这段时期中，美国竭力扶植独裁者上台，支持独裁政府的一切反动措施，打击这一地区的民族民主力量。例如，多米尼加的特鲁希略，萨尔瓦多的马丁?斯，危地马拉的乌比哥等独裁者都是美国扶植上台的。
    三种恶毒的干涉手法
    第二次世界大战对拉丁美洲有着深刻的影响。在战争末期和战后的最初年代中，拉丁美洲的人民运动受到反法西斯斗争胜利的鼓舞，在许多国家的政治生活中，表现得相当活跃。在有些国家中，民主力量和带有进步倾向的政治力量曾取代了独裁政权，如危地马拉在1944年发生了推翻乌比哥独裁政权的武装起义，智利的人民阵线在1946年的选举中获得了胜利，委内瑞拉的民主力量在1947年的选举中获得胜利，并且成立了以著名作家盖利戈斯为首的政权，稍后有1952年4月玻利维亚人民的武装起义，推翻了巴伊维昂独裁政权。其他像巴西、古巴、乌拉圭等国的进步力量也都在选举中获得重大成就。美帝国主义就不惜进一步扯掉它的“善邻政策”的外衣，公开以世界宪兵的姿态出现，用种种卑鄙的手段绞杀拉丁美洲各国的民主自由和民族独立。它一方面通过“美洲国家组织”建立了西半球的军事体系；一方面根据不同对象，采取不同的办法来扶植独裁政权，摧毁民主力量，绞杀民族独立运动。
    在美国所采取的做法中，主要有下述三种。第一，强迫某些获得进步力量支持的新政权向右转，以控制这些国家。这方面的例子之一，就是在人民阵线支持下于1946年上台的智利魏地拉政权，为了接受美国五千万美元的贷款而背叛人民阵线。例子之二就是在竞选时提出一套比较进步的纲领，因而得到人民拥护，1958年当选的阿根廷弗朗迪西政权，为了得到美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”和美国银行的三亿二千九百万美元的贷款，而接受损害民族和人民利益的“稳定经济计划”，并且完全背弃了竞选纲领，日益右倾倒退。
    第二，用最反动的亲美卖国的独裁政权来代替对美国稍有反抗或不满情绪的政权。1954年8月巴西总统瓦加斯自杀事件就是最明显的例子。瓦加斯本来是美国捧上台的，在他执政的初期推行着为美国垄断资本服务的政策。后来由于巴西人民运动的高涨，迫使瓦加斯采取了一些针对美国垄断资本集团的限制措施，如成立了国家垄断的“巴西石油公司”，计划没收外国的电力公司等等。美国垄断资本集团就策动政变，迫使瓦加斯自杀。
    第三，实行直接的武装干涉。这方面最突出的例子是众所周知的、1954年发生的危地马拉事件。其他拉丁美洲各国政变之所以接二连三地发生，也是美国在幕后策划的结果。据统计，从1948—1958年十年中，美国对拉丁美洲国家的重大颠覆事件就有十八起之多。
    不许危地马拉事件重演
    自从古巴革命以来，由于古巴革命最剧烈地震撼了美国在拉丁美洲的殖民基础，最有力地推动了拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，多米尼加和尼加拉瓜又爆发了反独裁武装起义。这就使美帝国主义干涉古巴和加勒比海地区的活动，特别显得疯狂。美国除了接二连三地利用古巴的卖国反动势力进行颠覆活动，并在美国的迈阿密和多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、海地组织武装力量准备侵入古巴之外，召开了最近闭幕的美洲外长会议，作为武装干涉的第一个步骤。在美国操纵和压力下，会议通过的一些决议，就是有利于美国的干涉活动的。它可以通过授权所谓泛美“和平委员会”“审查”有关地区的紧张局势和对各国进行监督的活动，来干预加勒比海地区各国的内政，反对古巴革命和拉丁美洲民族民主运动。
    但是，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲为所欲为的时代过去了。古巴人民的革命团结和古巴人民反对美国干涉的坚定决心、拉丁美洲各国人民的一致团结和互相支援以及全世界舆论和进步力量对古巴革命的支持，已经和将要有力地打击美国的干涉阴谋。美国在美洲外长会议所以不能完全得逞，就说明在东风压倒西风的形势下，拉丁美洲人民是可以制止1954年危地马拉事件的重演的。
