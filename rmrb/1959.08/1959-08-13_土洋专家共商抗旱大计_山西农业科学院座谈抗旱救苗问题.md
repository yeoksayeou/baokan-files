Local and Foreign Experts Discuss Major Drought Relief Plans
Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences Holds Symposium on Drought Resistance and Seedling Protection

(Our Newspaper’s dispatch) In order to ensure a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, Shanxi Province's local and foreign experts are jointly discussing major drought relief plans. On the morning of August 2nd, more than eighty local and foreign experts who participated in the Shanxi Province Wheat High-Yield Summary Conference held a symposium on how to resist drought and save seedlings, presided over by Wu Zao, the president of the Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences. At the meeting, representatives from wheat high-yield units in various regions, directors of agricultural science research institutes, and technical personnel unanimously agreed that Jinnan and Jin southeast are the main grain and cotton producing areas of Shanxi Province. It is necessary to mobilize all forces and exhaust all means to fight the drought and ensure a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. After everyone brainstormed, came up with ideas, and jointly researched and discussed, many drought resistance and seedling protection methods were proposed.

Everyone believes that to effectively overcome drought, classification and ranking should be carried out according to different land, different crops, and the severity of the drought. Following the principle of first irrigating the main crops and first irrigating severely drought-stricken areas, seize the opportunity to carry out rush irrigation in sequence, irrigating one mu counts as one mu, and irrigating one seedling counts as one seedling.

Fully utilizing water resources and water lifting tools is the central link in doing a good job in drought resistance and seedling protection. All water sources such as river water, well water, spring water, dry wells, pond water, cellar water, reservoir water, etc., should be fully utilized. Springs and wells with insufficient water flow should be excavated to increase the water volume and expand the irrigation area. In terms of water lifting tools, all usable water lifting tools, such as waterwheels, windlasses, and diesel engines and boiler-camel machines used for pumping water, should be fully utilized. For damaged or short-parted water lifting tools, relevant departments should be organized to quickly repair them in order to fully utilize the effectiveness of the tools.

Saving water and increasing the utilization rate of water is also very important. To this end, existing canal systems and channels should first be repaired, weeds in the canals should be removed, and the ridges and surfaces of the fields should be repaired. During irrigation, the channels should be checked at any time to block leakage, seepage, and water leakage, reduce water loss in channel conveyance, and increase water utilization.

Attention should also be paid to irrigation techniques. In plain areas, furrow irrigation, alternate furrow irrigation, small-plot irrigation, and light and shallow irrigation should be carried out. In flood areas, channels and sluice gates should be repaired to block and store floodwater for irrigation.

Everyone also specifically studied drought resistance methods for mountainous farmland:

(1) Use dry wells, stagnant ponds, and water cellars to carry out water carrying and point irrigation and stealth irrigation (watering through underground perforations). (2) Mix one load of thatch manure with five loads of water and dig holes beside the roots of crops for supplementary irrigation. (3) Spreading sand after watering can prevent soil moisture evaporation and allow crops to grow normally.

(4) In severely drought-stricken areas, small short-term crops, such as buckwheat and small autumn vegetables, should be intercropped to compensate for reduced production losses.

(5) Carry out inter-tillage and weeding to reduce water evaporation. As the saying goes, "There is water under the hoe," which illustrates the significance of inter-tillage and weeding. However, frequent and shallow hoeing should be mastered, and the soil should be raked back and forth twice after hoeing to break up the clods and reduce soil moisture evaporation. (6) Cotton should be pruned and strong buds removed in a timely manner to reduce nutrient and water consumption.

　　土洋专家共商抗旱大计
　　山西农业科学院座谈抗旱救苗问题
　　本报讯　为确保今年粮棉大丰收，山西省的土洋专家共商抗旱大计。8月2日上午，参加山西省小麦丰产总结会议的八十多个土洋专家，在山西省农业科学院武藻院长的主持下，举行了如何抗旱救苗的座谈会。会上，各地小麦丰产单位的代表，农业科学研究所的所长及技术人员等，一致认为晋南、晋东南是山西省粮棉主要产区，必须动员一切力量，想尽一切办法向旱灾搏斗，确保粮棉大丰收。经大家动脑筋，想办法，共同研究讨论，提出了许多抗旱救苗办法。
    大家认为，要有效地战胜干旱，应该根据不同土地，不同作物及旱灾严重程度进行分类排队，按先浇主要作物、先浇旱象严重地块的原则，抓紧时机依次进行抢浇，抢浇一亩算一亩，抢浇一苗算一苗。
    充分利用水利资源及提水工具，这是搞好抗旱保苗的中心环节。应将所有的水源如河水、井水、泉水、旱井、池塘水、窖水、水库水等，全部加以利用。泉水、井水不旺的应进行掏挖，以增大水量，扩大灌溉面积。在提水工具方面，应将一切可以利用的提水工具，如水车、辘轳以及抽水用的柴油机、锅驼机等，全部利用起来。对于损坏及缺短零件的提水工具，应组织有关部门迅速检修，以便充分发挥工具效能。
    节约用水，提高水的利用率，也很重要。为此先应整修现有的渠系工程及渠道，铲除渠内杂草，整好畦埂畦面。在灌溉时，应随时检查渠道，堵截跑水、渗水、漏水等现象，减少渠道输水损失，提高水的利用率。
    还要注意灌溉技术。平川地区应进行沟浇、隔沟浇、小畦浇及轻浇浅浇。洪水地区应整修渠道、闸门，以便拦洪蓄水进行浇灌。
    大家还特地研究了山区农田的抗旱办法：
  （一）利用旱井涝池及水窖进行担水点浇、偷浇
  （从地下穿孔浇水）。（二）以一担茅粪配水五担，在作物根旁挖穴追浇。（三）浇水后进行铺砂，可以防止土壤水分蒸发，使作物正常生长。
  （四）在干旱严重地区，应在行间套种些小日月作物，如荞麦、小秋菜等，以弥补减产损失。
  （五）中耕除草，减少水分蒸发。农谚说：“锄头底下有水”，这说明中耕除草的意义。但应掌握勤锄浅锄，并在锄后用耙子来回搂两遍，使土块破碎，减少土壤水分蒸发。（六）棉花应及时进行整枝打强芽，减少养分及水分消耗。
