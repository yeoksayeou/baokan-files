Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 17th - Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit announced today that the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party, originally scheduled for August 22nd, has been postponed to September 7th.

Aidit said in a press release that a third force is trying to sabotage the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party and create opposition between the Indonesian Communist Party and the armed forces. However, contrary to this strong attempt, the Preparatory Committee of the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Jakarta Garrison Command reached an agreement on the 16th that the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party will definitely open on September 7th and close on September 15th.

The communique also said that the reason given by the Jakarta Garrison Command for the congress not being held on the scheduled date was: "This involves security issues related to the celebration of National Day and other important issues." The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party can understand these reasons.

The press release said that the Preparatory Committee of the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Jakarta Garrison Commander also reached an agreement on the location of the congress and other technical issues.

　　印度尼西亚共产党总书记宣布
　　党代会延期下月七日举行
　  据新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地今天宣布，原定8月22日举行的印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会决定延期到9月7日举行。
    艾地在他发表的一项新闻公报中说，第三种力量力图破坏印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会，并且在印度尼西亚共产党和武装部队之间制造对立。但是，同这种强烈的企图相反，印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会筹备委员会同雅加达卫戍司令在16日已经达成协议，印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会肯定将在9月7日开幕，在9月15日闭幕。
    公报还说，雅加达卫戍司令部方面所提出的关于这次代表大会不能按照预定日期举行的理由是：“这牵涉到同庆祝国庆节有关的治安问题和其它重要问题”。印度尼西亚共产党中央能够谅解这些理由。
    新闻公报说，印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会筹备委员会同雅加达卫戍司令还就大会地点和其它一些技术性问题达成了协议。
