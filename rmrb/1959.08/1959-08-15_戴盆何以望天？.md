　　“How Can One Expect to See the Sky with a Basin on One's Head?”
　　Zhang Guoning
    In my childhood, I always felt that the edge of the sky was connected to the faintly visible mountains. As I grew older and went to the mountains to gather firewood, I looked into the distance and saw that the edge of the sky was behind mountains even further away. Only then did I realize that the sky was much larger than I had originally imagined. However, in my naive heart, I still thought that the sky had an edge; it was just connected to those more distant mountain peaks. I thought that if I went to the highest mountain, I would probably be able to touch the sky; this was naturally laughable. Now, thinking about this makes me recall an old saying: "How can one expect to see the sky with a basin on one's head?"
    Things in the world are constantly developing and changing. A certain thing, viewed within a certain period, has an edge, but from a long-term perspective, it is endless. Factory A created a new production record yesterday, but Factory B created an even higher record today; this commune did well in autumn field management for drought resistance and received a red flag, but another commune was not willing to lag behind and worked hard in every possible way, resulting in even better achievements; this athlete created a new record in race walking or running yesterday, but another athlete surpassed him today. Those who had already striven to be upstream find that after a while, they have to move forward again, otherwise they are no longer upstream, etc. These things are common in real life.
    There is no end to being upstream, and human potential is inexhaustible. The ancients said, "There are people beyond people, and skies beyond skies." Going from one mountain to another, crossing one ridge after another, from low to high, from good to better, this "change" is the inherent law of the development of things. Is the wheat field file system good? It is very good, but it still needs to develop towards a more perfect stage; building tens of millions of canals and weirs is naturally a very good thing, but it must advance towards high-standard water conservancy and a network of rivers; small indigenous groups are also turning into small foreign groups, medium foreign groups, and large foreign groups. Some of our comrades, including some who have received advanced titles, often fail to deeply recognize this point. They feel satisfied with the achievements they have already obtained, and when they are asked to continue to work hard and strive to be upstream, they complain and hesitate in the face of some minor difficulties; or they are intoxicated with the little achievements they have already obtained, feeling that "it's not bad already!" Or, as some people complain: "It is not easy to do things now, the higher-ups want to inspect, the lower-level have opinions, good still needs to be better, the production plan is completed, what else is required in terms of rhythmic production..." The problem lies in this "good still needs to be better." How can they not know that the requirement of "good still needs to be better" is determined by the law of the development of things. Those who feel it is good and therefore are unwilling to move forward in the direction of "still needs to be better" are a little too short-sighted. If they are frightened by a little difficulty or overwhelmed by a little victory, then such people can only confine themselves to a "small world," unknowingly putting a basin on their heads that blocks their vision, unable to see the situation clearly, and falling into the quagmire of right-leaning conservatism. If they do not work hard to extricate themselves, over time, they will sink deeper and deeper, and they will not even be able to see clearly the small world they stand on. For such comrades, we must first help them remove the basin tightly fastened to their heads that prevents them from looking into the distance, so that they can raise their heads and look at the vast sky, see that things are changing rapidly, that some temporary difficulties in development are being conquered, and that the great strength of the working people is infinite. Make them see that the surging torrent of life is surging forward, so that they can have the courage to "go up another floor" and continue to move towards the road of good still needs to be better. The spirit, to be encouraged again and again, is the same principle.

### “戴盆何以望天？”

　　“戴盆何以望天？”
　　张国宁
    幼年时，总觉得天边是和那隐隐望见的山接连的。及至年岁稍大，到山上拾柴，举目远眺，天边却在更远更远的山后，这才晓得天比自己原来所设想的要大的多。可是，稚嫩的心灵里总以为天还是有边的，它只不过是和那更加遥远的山头相接罢了。心想，如果到一个最高的山上，大概会摸到天；这自然是可笑的。现在想到这桩事使我连想起古人说过的一句话：“戴盆何以望天？”
    天下的事情本来是天天在发展变化的，某一事物，在一定时间内看，是有边的，但从长远看却是无止境的。甲厂昨天生产上创造了一个新纪录，乙厂今天生产上却创造了更高的纪录；这个公社在秋田管理抗旱防旱方面做的好，得到了红旗，而另一个公社不甘落后，千方百计地加油干，结果创造了更优异的成绩；这个运动员昨天在竞走或赛跑中创造了新纪录，而另一个运动员今天又压过了他。原来已经争得上游的，过了些时发现还得再前进，否则就不是上游了等等，这在现实生活中是屡见不鲜的事。
    上游不到头，人的潜力无穷尽。古人说，“人外有人，天外有天”，走一山又一山，越一岭又一岭，由低级到高级，由好到更好，这种“变”正是事物发展的固有规律。麦田档案制好不好？很好，但是，它还有待于往更加完善的地步发展；修了千万条渠堰自然是很好的事，但是，它还要向水利高标准化、河网化进军；小土群也正在变成小洋群、中洋群和大洋群。我们一些同志，其中包括一些获得先进称号的人，却往往不能深刻的认识到这一点。对于已经获得的成绩感到满足，而当要求他们继续鼓足干劲，力争上游时，他却在一些小的困难面前怨天尤人，趑趄不前；或者是陶醉于已经获得的那点成绩上，觉得“已经不算坏了！”或者像有些人埋怨的那样：“现在办事不容易，上面要检查，下面有意见，好了还要好，完成了生产计划，还要求什么按节奏生产……”问题就在于这个“好了还要好”上面。岂不知“好了还要好”的要求正是事物发展的规律所决定的。那种觉得好了，因而不愿向“还要好”的方向再前进的人，未免眼光过于短浅了一些。如果被一点小困难吓昏了头脑或者被一点小胜利冲昏了头脑，那末，这种人就只能把自己拘于“小天地”里，不知不觉在自己的头颅上戴上了一口遮蔽目光的盆，看不清形势，而陷入右倾保守的泥坑。倘不努力自拔，久之，愈陷愈深，他就会连自己立足的那块小天地也不能看得清楚了。对于这样的同志先要帮助他去掉紧紧篐在他头上的那口妨害极目远望的盆，使他们能够仰首展视那广阔的天际，看到事情在急剧的“变”，一些暂时的发展中的困难正在被征服，劳动人民的伟大力量是无穷的。使他们看到，那奔腾澎湃的生活激流正在汹涌前进，这样，他们才能有勇气“更上一层楼”，不断向着好了还要好的大路上走去。劲，要一鼓再鼓，也就是这个道理。
