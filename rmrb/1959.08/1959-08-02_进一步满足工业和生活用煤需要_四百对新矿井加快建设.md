Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: To further meet the needs of industry and daily life for coal, 400 pairs of mines are under full construction and accelerating construction. In the first half of the year, 14 new mines have been put into production, with a total designed capacity of 5.31 million tons of coal per year, an increase of 28% over the designed capacity of mines put into production in the same period last year.

The new mines put into production in the first half of this year, like the original coal mines across the country, not only shoulder the task of supporting the steel industry and other industrial coal needs, but also have the glorious task of supplying coal for people's daily life. Among these 14 pairs of mines, there are the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine and Nantong Coal Mine Yutianbao No. 1 Shaft, which supply coking coal to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the Fengfeng Yangquhe No. 1 Shaft and Pingdingshan Luofushan Mine, which supply coking coal to Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, the Shizuishan Coal Mine No. 4 Inclined Shaft, which supplies coking coal to Baotou Steel, and the Nanpiao Zhaojiatun, Tonghua Wangou and other mines, which supply coal for other industrial and people's daily life.

The construction period of the mines put into production this year has been greatly shortened compared with previous years. Thanks to the mass socialist emulation campaign of high speed, superior quality, greater quantity, and economy launched by coal mine builders, and the improvement of work efficiency, half of the mines put into production in the first half of the year have met the requirements for shortening the construction period put forward by the Ministry of Coal; some mines have even completed construction faster than the requirements of the Ministry of Coal. The construction of the Yangquhe No. 1 modern large shaft took only two years; the construction of the Shizuishan No. 4 medium-sized inclined shaft took only eleven months; the construction and installation of small mines such as Fuxin Zhaojiatun Mine and Tonghua Weitang Mine with a designed capacity of less than 300,000 tons, were basically completed in eight months and officially put into production. The engineering quality of these mines put into production is generally good.

At present, all coal mine construction workers are carrying out an increase production and practice economy campaign centered on technical innovation, vigorously promoting effective parallel three-dimensional cross-operations, multi-cycle and multi-process cross-operations, and comprehensive work teams, and other twenty-two advanced experiences to ensure that more and better new mines will be built in the second half of this year.

    进一步满足工业和生活用煤需要
    四百对新矿井加快建设
    新华社1日讯　我国有四百对矿井正在全面施工，加快建设。上半年已有十四对新建矿井投入了生产，总设计能力为年产煤炭五百三十一万吨，比去年同期投入生产矿井的设计能力增长了28％。
    今年上半年投入生产的这批新建矿井，同全国原有的各煤矿一样，不仅担负着支援钢铁工业及其他工业用煤的任务，而且有一部分也担负着人民生活用煤的光荣任务。这十四对矿井中，有供应重庆钢铁公司焦煤的中梁山煤矿和南桐煤矿鱼田堡一号竖井，有供应鞍钢和武钢焦煤的峰峰羊渠河一号竖井和平顶山落凫山矿，有供应包钢炼焦煤的石咀山煤矿四号斜井，以及供应其他工业用煤和人民生活用煤的南票赵家屯、通化湾沟等矿井。
    今年投入生产的矿井的建设工期，比往年大大缩短了。由于煤矿的建设者开展了群众性的多快好省施工红旗竞赛运动，提高了工作效率，上半年投入生产的矿井有一半达到了煤炭部提出的缩短工期的要求；有些矿井的建设工期，比煤炭部的要求还快。羊渠河一号现代化大型竖井的建设时间仅用了两年；石咀山四号中型斜井建设时间才用了十一个月；设计能力为三十万吨以下的阜新赵家屯矿和通化苇塘矿等小型矿井，用八个月的时间基本上完成了建筑安装工程而正式投入了生产。这些投入生产的矿井的工程质量，一般是好的。
    目前，全体煤矿建设职工正在开展以技术革新为中心的增产节约运动，大力推广行之有效的平行立体交叉作业，多循环多工序交叉作业，以及综合工作队等二十二项先进经验，保证在今年下半年建成更多更好的新建矿井。
