Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 16th: Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party of Indonesia, issued a written statement to the Indonesian people on the fourteenth anniversary of Indonesian independence (August 17th).

In his statement, Aidit said that national unity in Indonesia is now more consolidated than in the past after the restoration of the 1945 Constitution. He said that the fact that people from the broadest strata are wholeheartedly supporting the program of the Sukarno-Djuanda government confirms this once again. He also said that the establishment of the Provisional Supreme Advisory Council and the National Planning Council has positive significance, as it can be considered to have realized, to some extent, the proposition of cooperation between political parties. He said, however, that mutual suspicion still exists among those who support Indonesia's ideals of independence and revolution. This includes suspicion between political groups, between political groups and military groups, and between state institutions and the people, and between military and civilian officials. He pointed out that these phenomena must be eliminated, as they only give imperialism the opportunity to sow discord among them.

Aidit called for the implementation of the government's program and the strengthening of national unity. He said that all those who support the current cabinet's political program should do their utmost to realize these programs through close cooperation. Any attempt to hinder the realization of these programs, especially any attempt to defame President Sukarno, must be considered the most serious act of treason.

Aidit said that the people's hopes for some reforms in politics and life should be voiced. The people's creativity and wisdom should be promoted in order to realize the cabinet's program. Therefore, the people's democratic rights and freedoms must be guaranteed.

    艾地在国庆节发表声明
　　号召实现政府纲领加强民族团结
　　必须保证民主权利和自由发扬人民创造性
    新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处总书记艾地在印度尼西亚独立十四周年（8月17日）向印度尼西亚人民发表书面声明。
    艾地在声明中说，印度尼西亚在恢复了1945年宪法以后，民族团结比过去更为巩固了。他说，最广泛阶层的人民都在全心全意地支持苏加诺—朱安达政府的纲领，这一事实再次证实了这一点。他又说，临时最高谘询委员会和国家计划委员会的成立具有积极的意义，因为这可以被认为在某种程度上实现了政党之间合作的主张。他说，然而，在拥护印度尼西亚为独立而革命的理想的人当中，还存在着相互猜疑。这包括政治集团之间的猜疑，政治集团和军人集团之间的猜疑，国家机构和人民、军人和文职官员之间的猜疑。他指出，必须消灭这些现象，因为这些现象只会使帝国主义得到在他们中间散播不和的机会。
    艾地号召实现政府的纲领和加强民族团结。他说，所有支持现内阁政治纲领的人应该竭尽全力通过密切的合作来实现这些纲领。任何阻挠实现这些纲领的企图，特别是想诋毁苏加诺总统的企图都必定被认为是最严重的叛国行为。
    艾地说，应当把人民对于在政治方面和生活中进行一些改革的希望讲出来。应该发扬人民的创造性和智慧，以便实现内阁的纲领。因此人民的民主权利和自由必须得到保证。
