Xinhua News Agency, London, August 20th: The British National Coal Board announced a plan yesterday to close approximately 240 coal mines within the next six years (ending in 1965). This number is nearly one-third of the total number of coal mines in Britain.

This decision was made because the National Coal Board estimates that in the next six years, under conditions of general economic recession, both domestic demand for coal and coal exports will decline sharply. The Coal Board's original plan estimated annual coal consumption at 240 million tons, but coal consumption has been gradually declining since 1955. In 1955, coal consumption, including exports, was 229 million tons, but in 1958 it fell to 200 million tons. The Coal Board is now reducing its estimate of future consumption to between 200 million and 215 million tons.

The closure of coal mines means that approximately 70,000 miners will be laid off, most of whom are miners from Scotland, South Wales, Northumberland, and Durham. In the villages of these regions, the vast majority of men work in the mines. The implementation of the coal mine closure plan will turn these villages into ghost towns, as there are no other industries there. Miners and their families will have to go to other regions to find work. People who have been skilled miners for their entire lives, even if they find work, will only be able to do unskilled work in other industries and receive very low wages.

Ernest Jones, president of the National Union of Mineworkers of Great Britain, said on the 19th that the coal mine closure plan made the miners' union uneasy and was closely watching the situation.

　　降低煤产量对付经济衰退
    英国要关掉三分之一煤矿
    关闭方案六年内实现　将有七万矿工被解雇
    新华社伦敦20日电　英国国家煤业局昨天公布一项计划，决定在今后六年内（到1965年年底止），关闭大约二百四十座煤矿，此数将近英国煤矿总数的三分之一。
    采取这个决定是由于国家煤业局估计在今后六年内，在经济普遍衰退的情况下，国内对煤的需求量以及煤的出口量都将剧烈下降。煤业局原订计划，估计煤的年消费量为二亿四千万吨，但是从1955年以来，煤的消费量一直在逐步下降。在1955年，煤的消费量，包括出口在内，是二亿二千九百万吨，而1958年下降到了二亿吨，煤业局现在把它的对将来消费量的估计减少到二亿至二亿一千五百万吨。
    煤矿的关闭意味着大约七万名矿工将被解雇，他们大多数是苏格兰、南威尔士、诺森伯兰和达勒姆的矿工。在这些地区的村子里，绝大多数的男人都是在矿里工作的。实行关闭煤矿的计划将使这些村子变成无人之乡，因为那里没有其他的工业，矿工们和他们的家属不得不到其他地区去寻找工作。作了一辈子熟练矿工的人即使找到工作的话，也只能在其他工业里做不熟练的工作，拿很低的工资。
    英国全国矿工联盟主席欧内斯特·琼斯19日说，关闭煤矿的计划使矿工联盟感到不安，并且认真地注视着这种局势。
