The former Northeast Agricultural Science Research Institute used six cattle, divided into two groups, to conduct a comparative feeding trial (70 days) using silage corn stalks and dry corn stalks. When the first group of three cattle were fed silage corn stalks, their initial total weight was 996.6 kilograms, with an average weight of 332.2 kilograms per head. During the trial period, they consumed a total of 372 kilograms of crushed bean stalks and bean pod husks, and 2,980 kilograms of silage corn stalks (equivalent to 780.5 kilograms of dry matter). At the end of the trial, the average weight gain per head was 13.3 kilograms. Calculated on the basis of 100 kilograms of dry matter from silage corn stalks, the weight gain was 5.1 kilograms.

The second group of three cattle were fed dry corn stalks. At the beginning of the trial, their total weight was 989.5 kilograms, with an average weight of 329.8 kilograms per head. During the trial period, they consumed a total of 372 kilograms of crushed bean stalks and bean pod husks, and 11,122.8 kilograms of dry corn stalks (equivalent to 1,016 kilograms of dry matter), which was 235.5 kilograms more than the first group. At the end of the trial, the total weight gain of the three cattle was 15.1 kilograms, with an average gain of 5.03 kilograms per head, which was 8.25 kilograms less than the first group. Calculated on the basis of 100 kilograms of dry matter from dry corn stalks, the weight gain was 1.49 kilograms.

    青贮玉米秸喂牛增重快
    原东北农业科学研究所用六头牛，分成两组进行青贮玉米秸和干玉米秸饲养对比试验（喂养七十天）。第一组三头牛喂青贮玉米秸试验开始的时候，三头体重共计九百九十六点六公斤，每头平均重三百三十二点二公斤。试验期间共吃碎豆秸、豆角皮三百七十二公斤，青贮玉米秸二千九百八十公斤。（折成干物质七百八十点五公斤）。试验完毕时，平均每头增加十三点三公斤。折算每一百公斤青贮玉米秸的干物质，可以增加体重五点一公斤。
    第二组三头牛喂干玉米秸。试验开始时，三头牛体重共计九百八十九点五公斤，平均每头重三百二十九点八公斤。试验期间共吃碎豆秸、豆角皮三百七十二公斤，干玉米秸一万一千一百二十二点八公斤（折成干物质一千零十六公斤），比第一组多吃二百三十五点五公斤。试验完毕时，三头牛体重较试验开始时增加十五点一公斤，平均每头增加五点零三公斤，比第一组少增八点二五公斤，折算一百公斤干玉米秸的干物质增重一点四九公斤。
