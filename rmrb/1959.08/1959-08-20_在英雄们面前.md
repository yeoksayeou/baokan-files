    Before the Heroes
    Cheng Li
    In Henan, where the drought demon is rampant, the land is cracked, the grass and trees are dried up, and eighty million mu of land are suffering from drought. However, the heroic people of Henan, under the leadership of the Party, with the spirit of overturning rivers and seas, and with the determination of "fighting drought to the end and ensuring a good harvest without rain," after half a month of hard work, 60.3 million mu of disaster-stricken land have been watered one to three times. No matter how crazy the drought demon is, it must bow its head and surrender before the heroic people.
    Under the leadership of the Party, we are organized to ask for grain from drought, fight for a good harvest from floods, and fight against all natural disasters. Although we cannot completely eradicate natural disasters for the time being, and cannot control nature as we wish, it can only cause us some temporary difficulties, but it cannot defeat our ambition to transform nature. One day, we will eradicate all natural disasters, make them tame to man, and benefit mankind.
    We have such lofty ambitions towards nature, and such firm confidence in natural disasters, so what are some temporary and partial difficulties existing in other tasks?! With the wise leadership of the Party, the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the leaping forward situation, the people's communes with infinite potential, and the heroic people... the difficulties before us will also be overcome by us, so as to achieve victory, and then move from victory to victory.
    We can overcome difficulties, first of all because we dare to despise difficulties, go to the difficulties, meet the difficulties, and not fear difficulties, not evade difficulties. Wherever there are difficulties, there are our real heroes. Look, when the flood submerged more than 20 villages in Gaodianzi Township, our heroes – the Party Secretary, the commune director, cadres, technicians, Party members... appeared. Their own belongings were washed away by the flood, leaving only the two pieces of clothing they were wearing, and they themselves were almost swept away by the flood... However, they ignored all this and rescued more than 200 lives and a large amount of grain and materials at the risk of their lives (see page 6 of the People's Daily on the 5th of this month for details). Look again, when the electric cylinder spewed out raging flames, not only threatening the safety of the entire Benxi Gongyuan Cement Plant, but also threatening the lives of nearby residents, our hero Fang Zelin climbed onto the electric cylinder, endured the burning pain and dizziness, held the fireball-like electric cylinder with both hands, and pushed it down with all his strength...; this is the true color of a hero (see page 6 of the People's Daily on the 7th of this month for details).
    The reason why heroes are not afraid of difficulties is that they have a heroic red heart. For the sake of the masses, for the sake of the collective, for the sake of the socialist cause, they do not care about personal gains and losses, hardships and difficulties. Therefore, they hold their heads high, are full of fighting spirit, and are fearless in the face of difficulties. This is the driving force to overcome difficulties.
    Of course, our daring to despise difficulties and meet difficulties does not mean ignoring difficulties. Rather, under the determination to overcome difficulties and overcome difficulties, we analyze the location of the difficulties with a clear head and a calm attitude, find out the measures to overcome the difficulties, create the conditions to overcome the difficulties, and overcome it and defeat it with perseverance and tenacious fighting spirit.

    在英雄们面前
    承里
    在旱魔逞凶的河南，地皮旱裂了，草木旱干了，八千万亩土地，遭受旱灾。可是，英雄的河南人民，在党的领导下，以翻江倒海的气概，以“有旱抗到底，无雨保丰收”的决心，经过半个月的奋战，有六千零三十万亩受灾土地，浇过一遍到三遍水。旱魔再疯狂，在英雄的人民面前，也一定要俯首归降。
    我们在党领导下，组织起来，向干旱要粮食，向洪水争丰收，向一切自然灾害做斗争。尽管，我们暂时还不能完全根除自然灾害，还不能得手应心地控制大自然，但是，它只能给我们造成一些暂时的困难，却不能战胜我们改造大自然的雄心大志。总会有一天，我们会把一切自然灾害根除掉，使它驯服于人，造福于人。
    对天公，我们有这样的凌云壮志，对自然灾害，我们有这样的坚定信心，那么，在其它工作中，存在的一些暂时的局部的困难，又算得什么？！有党的英明领导，有总路线的光辉照耀，有跃进的形势，有潜力无穷的人民公社，有英雄的人民……，摆在我们面前的困难，也将会被我们克服掉，从而取得胜利，又从胜利走向胜利。
    我们能够战胜困难，首先在于我们敢于藐视困难，到困难中去，迎接困难，而不畏惧困难，不逃避困难，那里有困难，那里就有我们的真正的英雄。看，当大水淹没了高甸子乡二十多个村庄的时候，我们的英雄——党委书记、公社社长、干部、技术员、党员……出现了。他们自己的东西被洪水冲走了，只剩下身上穿的两件衣服了，自己也险些被洪水卷走……。可是，这一切全不理睬，而是奋不顾身的抢救出二百多条人命和大量粮食、物资（详见本月5日人民日报六版）。再看，当电缸里喷出熊熊的火苗，不仅威胁着整个本溪工源水泥厂的安全，也威胁着邻近居民的生命的时候，我们的英雄房泽林，爬上了电缸，忍着火烧的剧痛和头晕眼花，双手搬住火球似的电缸，用尽全力往下推去……；这就是英雄的本色（详见本月7日人民日报六版）。
    英雄所以不畏惧困难，就在于他们有一颗英雄的红心。为了群众，为了集体，为了社会主义事业，个人的一切得失，艰苦困难，都不计较。所以，他们在困难面前，昂首挺胸，斗志旺盛，无所畏惧。这就是克服困难的动力。
    当然，我们敢于藐视困难，迎接困难，并不等于忽视困难。而是在战胜困难，克服困难的决心之下，以清醒的头脑，冷静的态度，认真地分析困难之所在，找出克服困难的措施，创造克服困难的条件，以坚韧不拔的毅力，顽强的斗志，去克服它，战胜它。
