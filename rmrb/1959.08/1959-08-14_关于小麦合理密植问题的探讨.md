Reasonable close planting is the central link in increasing agricultural production, which is an undisputed conclusion. Even opponents of close planting agree that planting should be neither sparse nor dense, advocating for reasonable close planting. Proponents of close planting also advocate for reasonable close planting, but their interpretations of reasonable close planting differ, and there are theoretical disagreements. Those who favor sparse planting advocate "primarily effective tillering," saying, "It's not dense if you sow densely; it's dense when it grows densely." The saying "one wheat plant divides into nine heads" is widespread in rural areas, so they advocate sowing less and tillering more. Proponents of close planting believe that high wheat yield must rely on the main ear and control effective tillering, so they advocate sowing more and tillering less.

	The Total Number of Wheat Ears Per Mu Has a Certain Limit

The factors that determine the yield per unit area of wheat are the number of ears, the size of the ears, and the fullness of the grains. Under normal circumstances, more ears cannot mean larger ears, and larger ears cannot mean more ears. The so-called reasonable close planting is to unify these three contradictions in the total output per unit area, which is to adjust the objective law of the relationship between individual and group. To solve this problem, we must first solve how many ears can grow per mu and how many ears are best. This is the fundamental premise of reasonable close planting. Therefore, sparse planting with large ears cannot be so sparse that only a few hundred ears grow per mu, and even if each ear is very large, it cannot grow to half a jin. Dense planting cannot be so dense that, as some people say, an egg cannot fall through. The result of such density can only be reduced production.

This fact eloquently proves that no matter how large the sowing amount is, the total number of ears per mu will no longer increase after reaching a certain level, whether in irrigated or dry land, approximately between 700,000 and 1,100,000. The larger the sowing amount, the smaller the proportion of effective ears per mu. Objective reality does not follow some people's ideal that the larger the sowing amount, the more ears per mu. Given the current varieties and cultivation methods, about one million ears will be the peak number of ears per mu for wheat, and the maximum sowing amount should not exceed this limit.

	Ear-to-Grain Ratio Should Maintain a Certain Proportion

Although wheat can grow to about one million ears per mu, the highest yield is not from the most ears. The highest wheat yield must be a balanced state in which the number of ears, the size of the ears, and the weight of the grains maintain a certain proportion. If the individual and the group lose a certain proportional balance, it will inevitably suffer reduced production.

Although this survey is not very reliable in terms of accuracy due to the limited materials, the phenomenon it shows cannot be regarded as a law, but it can be seen as a general trend. An ear-to-grain ratio of less than 2,000:1 can achieve high yield, 2,000:1 to 5,000:1 can achieve large-scale high yield, 6,000:1 to 10,000:1 can basically avoid reduced production, and more than 10,000:1 will lead to reduced production. At the same time, it can also be seen that after the number of ears per mu reaches 600,000, to achieve greater yields, it is necessary to try every means to increase the number of grains per ear and the grain weight, rather than increasing the number of ears.

	Sunlight and Lodging are Objective Restrictions of Highly Dense Planting

After the sowing amount of wheat per mu is increased to 100 jin, according to the general medium-grain seed with 15,000 grains per jin and no tillering, there should be 1.5 million plants per mu. But why is it actually only about one million plants? Under normal circumstances, 5%-10% of the seeds should not germinate, and another 10% or so should be removed due to poor land preparation and sowing, and underground insect damage, resulting in missing seedlings. In fact, only 1.2 million plants can emerge, but these 1.2 million plants also die and lodge due to many objective reasons such as crowding in the seedling stage and poor ventilation and light transmission. In the end, less than one million ears can emerge. The reason for wheat lodging after highly dense planting, in addition to watering, fertilization, and overly loose soil after deep plowing, is mainly due to the fact that after the sowing amount exceeds a certain limit, there are too many plants per unit area, forming poor ventilation and light transmission, large shading, and the lower leaves cannot carry out normal photosynthesis to produce nutrients. At the same time, the cell walls of the first and second nodes are loose, thin, and etiolated, unable to support the weight of the upper part, resulting in lodging. The intensity of light is the determining factor for wheat lodging. According to a survey of light in wheat fields with and without lodging in the late milk-ripe stage:

The light intensity at the first node of all non-lodged wheat is above 65% (compared to the light intensity at the top), and the light intensity between the middle stem nodes is above 80%. The light intensity between the middle stem nodes that cannot rise after lodging is basically below 50%. From this, it can be seen that the light intensity at the first node of wheat in the milk-ripe stage must be maintained above 65%, and the intensity between the middle stem nodes needs to be maintained above 80%, otherwise it will inevitably cause serious lodging.

The length of the first node of lodged wheat is more than 1.2 times longer than that of non-lodged wheat, but the weight is 54.2% lighter. This shows that there is no increase in the substance of the etiolated first and second nodes, but mainly the elongation of the original substance. It is precisely because the stems of these two nodes are both long and thin that they cannot support the weight of the upper stems, leaves, and ears, and will naturally lodge after reaching a certain level.

Lodging is a serious enemy of wheat yield reduction. The degree of yield reduction varies depending on the timing and degree of lodging. According to a survey in Yangcheng: in the same field, severely lodged wheat reduced yield by 68%-77% compared to non-lodged wheat, while wheat that recovered after lodging only reduced yield by 21%. After excessive dense planting, no matter what measures are taken, such as topdressing with plant ash, pine needle juice, or scaffolding, the effect is not obvious. Only dry land without watering can control plant growth and prevent lodging. According to the dryland dense planting experiments of the Yincheng and Baodian agricultural experiment stations in Changzhi City, although each mu reached 800,000 to 1,100,000 plants, due to the low plant growth (no more than 60 cm), short and thin leaves, and small shading power, lodging was prevented. However, such wheat has poor growth and development due to insufficient water and fertilizer, with only 2 to 4 grains per ear and light thousand-grain weight, resulting in a yield of less than 200 jin per mu. Therefore, it cannot achieve our goal of high yield. The total number of wheat ears per mu, no matter how large the sowing amount, has a peak number of approximately one million, but such a large number of ears loses the minimum balance between individual and group, resulting in lodging, small ears, and shriveled grains, thus suffering a serious reduction in yield. Under sufficient water and fertilizer conditions, maintaining 450,000 to 600,000 ears per mu allows both the individual and the group to develop fully, resulting in more ears, larger ears, full grains, less lodging, and the highest yield. Thirty to forty thousand ears per mu can only obtain a general yield. If there are less than 200,000 ears per mu, combined with insufficient water and fertilizer conditions, this becomes the root cause of reduced production and must be eliminated.

	The Most Suitable Sowing Amount

The amount of sowing is directly related to the number of ears per mu, and the number of ears per mu is mainly determined by the amount of sowing. However, there are still serious differences of opinion on this issue, namely, whether to increase yield by relying on the main ear or by relying on effective tillering. This is the focus of the current close planting debate and needs further research. After this survey, a preliminary trend can still be found. From a survey of 51 different land types, sowing amounts, and yields in the entire region:

According to a survey of four types of land: high-yielding fields, first-class wheat, second-class wheat, and third-class wheat, the average sowing amount per mu is 26 jin to 51 jin, and the actual number of plants per mu accounts for 72% to 84% of the expected number of plants. This means that 16% to 28% of the seeds cannot grow into effective plants due to low germination rate, poor land preparation, underground insect pests, and other losses. The average number of ears per plant is 4% to 21%, and the highest is 56%. This fact shows that under the current cultivation conditions, in large-field production, 100 wheat plants can only divide into about 15 heads, and the most is only 56. The saying "one wheat plant divides into nine heads" is impossible in large-field production. On the other hand, it is also seen that wheat is a tillering crop, which is its natural growth law. It is impossible to completely control tillering by increasing the sowing amount. Therefore, wheat yield increase must be "main ear-based, tillering-assisted." Overemphasizing any aspect is incorrect. From the actual number of plants and the expected number of plants, it can also be seen that the sowing amount in high-yielding fields exceeds 50 jin, but the proportion of actual plants is lower than that of first-class wheat and second-class wheat. This proves that the sowing amount is somewhat excessive, causing early plant death.

	Narrow-Row Strip Planting is the Best Dense Planting Method

Reasonable dense planting is not only about accurately determining the most suitable sowing amount, but also about adopting the most correct method to further rationally utilize soil fertility, water, and solar energy. At the same time, it should also consider machine operation and facilitate field management. The main sowing methods in the entire region are: narrow-row strip planting with 4 to 5 cun, wide-row strip planting with 7 to 8 cun, and wide-band strip planting with 2 to 4 cun. In addition, there are a small number of furrow planting and cross planting. In particular, due to the large increase in sowing amount last year, many areas have emphasized widening the sowing width to increase direct land utilization. Therefore, there are also many new creations and improvements in dense planting methods. But in general, 5-cun drill sowing and 10-row seeders (4.5 cun) are the best, with a soil utilization rate of about 25%. The Yangcheng Ciying Experimental Station found that a yield of 300.8 jin per mu with 5-cun row spacing increased by 43% compared to a yield of 210 jin per mu with 7-cun row spacing. Although the land utilization rate of wide-band strip planting above 3 cun can reach about 40%, it can also achieve high yields under normal circumstances, but it is difficult to sow with a seed drill, the sowing is uneven, the depth is inconsistent, and it is heavy to pull. In individual water areas with less land and more labor, and in areas with thin soil and less fertilizer that use plowing to open ditches combined with concentrated strip fertilization, it can still be used, and its yield increase efficiency is extremely obvious. For areas where fertilizer is generally spread before sowing, using a 5-cun strip sowing drill is better than using a wide-band drill. According to a survey of land with a sowing width of 3 cun or more, the number of wheat ears in the 1 cun area on both sides of the sowing width is 33.3% more than the number of ears in the 1 cun area in the middle, and the number of grains per ear is 22.7% more. According to seven comparative experiments in Huangxuebao and other places, 4-cun row spacing with 1-cun sowing width increased yield by 43.1% compared to 8-cun row spacing with 2.5-cun sowing width. According to a survey of ten small farms in Yongji and other places, 5-cun row spacing with 1-cun sowing width increased yield by 3.51% compared to 4-cun row spacing with 4-cun sowing width. Although the direct land utilization rate of wide-band strip planting seems to be 15% to 20% more than that of narrow-row planting on the surface, the plants are densely packed together and cannot evenly utilize land and solar energy (because land and light energy are evenly distributed on every cun of land). Narrow-row strip planting has more rows in the same area, so plants have more opportunities to utilize edge rows, while wide-band strip planting has fewer rows and fewer opportunities to utilize edge rows. For example, the direct land utilization rate of 4-cun sowing width and 4-cun row spacing wide-band strip planting is 50%, while the land utilization rate of 5-cun sowing (increasing the ridge back to 6 cun) is 25%. Calculating each row with an additional utilization of 1 cun (half a cun on each side), the land utilization rate also reaches 50%.

In short, dense planting should be calculated based on the maximum effective number of ears per mu, not the amount of sowing. Because what determines the yield is the number and size of the ears. No matter how large the sowing amount, the maximum effective number of ears per mu is between 700,000 and 1,100,000. When determining the sowing amount, this limit cannot be exceeded. Although the total number of ears per mu can reach about one million, it cannot obtain the highest yield. Because such a large number of ears loses the minimum balance between individual and group. Generally speaking, 450,000 to 600,000 is the best, the relationship between individual and group develops normally, and the yield is the highest. Each wheat ear maintains a nutritional area of 1 to 1.5 square cun.

Reasonable dense planting should be "main ear-based, tillering-assisted." In good irrigated and dry land, 450,000 to 600,000 ears should be maintained. Calculated with medium-grain seeds such as Bima No. 1, with 15,000 grains per jin, the sowing amount per mu should be 35 to 45 jin, and should not exceed 50 jin at most. General irrigated land and better dry land should maintain 300,000 to 400,000 ears. The sowing amount is 25 to 35 jin. The worst dry and thin land should maintain 250,000 to 300,000 ears per mu, and the sowing amount is 20 to 25 jin. In addition, appropriate increases or decreases should be determined based on specific conditions such as the timing of sowing, the size of the grains, the tillering characteristics of the variety, and the quality of land preparation.

Narrow-row strip planting is the best dense planting method. The direct land utilization rate is 25% to 30%, and the ratio of sowing width to row spacing is 1:2 or 1:3. Use a 5-cun drill for sowing. The width of the sowing width of general drill sowing does not exceed 2 cun. The center of the dense planting method for dry and thin land is to reduce the row spacing, so that each grain is evenly distributed on the land, and to expand the nutritional area of each plant as much as possible. In the case of less fertilizer, in order to combine ditching and fertilization, wide-band strip planting can be promoted. In areas where fertilizer is spread and drill sowing is used, widening the drill width should not be promoted.

    关于小麦合理密植问题的探讨
    山西省晋东南农业科学研究所　刘杰
    合理密植是农业增产的中心环节，这是没有异议的结论，连密植的反对派也赞成种地既不能稀也不能稠，主张合理密植，密植论者也主张合理密植，但是对合理密植的解释是不同的，在理论上还有分歧意见。稀植论者主张以“有效分蘖为主”，他们说：“种稠不算稠，长稠才算稠”，在农村中普遍流传着“一麦分九头”的说法，因此主张少播种多分蘖；密植论者认为小麦丰产必须靠主穗，控制有效分蘖，因此，主张多下种、少分蘖。
　　每亩地小麦总穗数有一定的限度
    决定小麦单位面积产量的是穗子的多少，穗子的大小，籽粒的饱满等三个基本条件。在一般的情况下，穗多不能穗大，穗大不能穗多，所谓合理密植就是把这三个矛盾统一在单位面积的总产量上，也就是调整个体和群体关系的客观规律。要解决这个问题，首先必须解决一亩地到底能长多少穗子，而又以多少穗子为最好，这是合理密植的根本前提。所以稀植长大穗，也不能稀到一亩地长几百穗，一穗再大也长不到半斤。密也不能密到像某些人所说的把鸡蛋放在上边落不下去，这样密的结果，只能是减产。
    这个事实雄辩地证明了，不论播种量多大，每亩总穗数达到一定程度之后就不再增加，不论水、旱地，大约都在七十万到一百一十万之间。播种量愈大，每亩的有效穗数的比例愈小。客观的事实并没有按照某些人的理想那样——播种量愈大，每亩穗子愈多。就目前的品种和耕作栽培方法，一百万穗左右将是小麦每亩穗数的顶点，最大的播种量是不应当超过这个限度的。
　　穗粒应保持有一定比例
    每亩小麦虽然可以长到一百万穗左右，但是产量最高的却不是穗子最多的。最高的小麦产量必须是穗数和穗子的大小、子粒重量保持有一定比例的均衡状态，如果个体和群体失去了一定的比例均衡状态，就必然要遭受减产。
    这个调查虽然因为材料少，准确性还不十分可靠，其所表现出来的现象还不能把它当成规律去看，但总算看出一个大致的趋向。穗粒比例为二千以下比一的可获得高产，二千到五千比一的可获得大面积丰产，六千到一万比一的，基本上可以不减产，一万以上比一的就要减产。同时也可以看到，每亩穗数达到六十万穗以后，要想获得更大丰产，则必须是想尽一切办法提高每穗粒数和子粒重，而不是穗数的增加。
　　光照和倒伏是高度密植的客观限制
    每亩小麦播种量增加到一百斤以后，按一般中粒种每市斤一万五千粒不分蘖计算，每亩地应当有一百五十万株穗，但实际为什么只有一百万株左右呢？在正常情况下，应当去掉5％——10％的种子不发芽，再除去10％左右因整地播种不良和地下虫为害而造成的缺苗断垅，实际上只能出一百二十万株，但这一百二十万株亦因苗期拥挤、通风透光不良等许多客观原因造成死亡和倒伏。最后能秀穗的不到一百万穗。高度密植后小麦倒伏的原因，除了浇水、施肥、深耕后土壤过分松疏等原因外，主要是因播种量超过一定限度后，在单位面积上植株过多，形成通风透光不良、遮荫大，下部叶子不能进行正常的光合作用而制造养分。同时第一、二节细胞壁疏松细薄徒长，支持不住上部的重量而倒伏。光照的强弱是小麦倒伏的决定因素，据在乳熟后期倒伏和不倒伏麦地光照调查：
    凡是不倒伏的小麦，第一节部位的光照强度都在65％以上（与顶部光照强度比较），中部茎节间光的强度在80％以上。凡是倒伏后起不来的中部茎节间光度基本都在50％以下。由此可以看出，在小麦乳熟期第一节部位的光照强度必须保持在65％以上，中部茎节间的强度需保持在80％以上，否则必然造成严重的倒伏。
    倒伏的小麦第一节的长度比不倒伏的长1.2倍多，重量却轻54.2％。这说明徒长的第一、第二节的物质没有什么增加，而主要是原有物质的延长。正由于这两节的茎节既长且薄，不能支持上部茎叶穗的重量，到一定程度后便会自然倒伏。
    倒伏是小麦减产的严重敌人，随着倒伏时期的早晚和倒伏程度不同，其减产程度亦不同，据在阳城调查：在同一块地，严重倒伏的比不倒伏的减产68％—77％，而倒伏后起来的仅为21％。在过分密植后的倒伏不论采用追施草木灰、松毛汁、搭架等任何措施，其效果都是不明显的。唯有不浇水的旱地能控制植株生长，才能防止倒伏。据长治市荫城、鲍店两农业试验站的旱地密植试验，虽然每亩达到80—110万株，但由于植株生长低（不过60公分），叶短、叶瘦、遮光力小，才会不倒伏。但这样的小麦由于水肥不足，使植株生长发育不良，每穗小麦只有2到4粒，千粒重也轻，每亩产量均在二百斤以下。因此不能达到我们的丰产目的。每亩小麦的总穗数不论播种量多大，它的顶点穗数大致均在一百万左右，但这样多的穗数，由于个体和群体失去了最低限度的均衡状态，形成倒伏穗小子瘪，因而遭受严重减产。在水肥充足的条件下每亩保持有四十五万到六十万穗，使个体和群体都得到了充分的发展，因而穗多、穗大、子饱、倒伏少，产量也最高。每亩三十万到四十万穗的，只能获得一般的产量。如果每亩在二十万穗以下，再结合上水肥条件赶不上，这就成为减产的根源，因此必须消灭。
　　最适宜的播种量
    播种量的多少，直接关系着每亩穗数的多少，而每亩穗数的多少，主要还是由播种量来决定的。但对这个问题还是有着严重的分歧意见，即靠主穗增产还是靠有效分蘖，这是当前密植争论的焦点，是需要进一步研究的问题。经过这次调查还是可以找出一个初步趋向，从全区五十一个不同土地类型、播种量和产量调查看：
    据高产田、一类麦、二类麦、三类麦等四个类型地调查：每亩播种量平均为二十六斤到五十一斤，每亩实有株数占应有株数的72％到84％，就是说有16％到28％的种子因发芽率低，整地不良，地下虫害及其它损耗而不能生长成有效株数。每株的平均穗数为4％到21％，最高的穗子为56％，这个事实说明了在当前耕作栽培条件下，在大田生产中，一百株小麦只能分十五个头左右，最多的也不过五十六个，那种“一麦分九头”的说法在大田生产中是不可能的；另一方面也看到，小麦是一种分头作物，这是它的自然生长规律，企图用加大播种量的办法完全控制不分头也是不可能的。因此，小麦增产必须以“主穗为主，分头为辅”，过分强调任何一方面都是不正确的。从实有株数和应有株数中也看到，高产田的播种量超过五十斤，其实有株数的比例反而低于一类麦和二类麦，这证明播种量是有些过大，造成植株早期死亡。窄行条播是最好的密植方法
    合理密植不仅仅是要很好的确定最适宜的播种量，而且也必须采用最正确的方法，才能进一步合理利用土壤肥力、水分和太阳光能。同时也应当考虑机器操作和便于田间管理。全区的播种方法主要有：四至五寸的窄行条播，七至八寸的宽行条播，二至四寸的宽幅条播。此外还有少数的畦播和交叉播种。特别是由于去年播种量的大量增加，许多地区都强调了加宽播幅，提高直接土地利用率。因此在密植方法上，也有许多新的创造和改进。但总的看来还是以五寸耧播种和十行播种机（4.5寸）为最好，土壤利用率为25％左右。阳城次营试验站试验五寸行距的亩产300.8斤，比七寸行距的亩产二百一十斤增产43％。在三寸以上的宽幅条播虽然土地利用率可达到40％左右，在一般情况下也可以获得丰产，但因摇耧播种困难，下子不匀，深浅不一致，拉着重。在土地少、劳力多的个别水地区，有些地薄肥少、用犁开沟结合集中条施肥的地区还均可采用，其增产效率极为明显。对播种前普遍撒施肥料的地区，用宽幅耧播种不如用5寸条播耧为最好。据3寸以上播幅条播地调查：在播幅两边一寸地方的小麦穗数要比中间一寸宽穗数多33.3％，每穗粒数多22.7％。另据黄穴堡等七个对比试验看，四寸行距一寸播幅比8寸行距2.5寸播幅增产43.1％。另据永济等地十个小农场调查，5寸行距，1寸播幅的比4寸行距，4寸播幅的增产3.51％。宽幅条播法从表面看虽然土地直接利用率比窄行的多15％到20％。但因植株密集在一起，不能均匀利用地力和太阳光能（因为地力光能是均匀地分布在每一寸的土地上），在同等面积上窄行条播的行数多，因而植株利用边行的机会也多，宽幅条播的行数少，边际利用机会也少。例如四寸播幅四寸幅距的宽幅条播法，土地直接利用率为50％，而五寸播种（加大垅背为六寸），土地利用率为25％，以每行各多利用一寸（二边半寸）计算，则土地利用率同样达到50％。
    总之，密植应当以每亩的最大限度的有效穗数计算。不能以播种量多少为标准。因为决定产量的是穗子的多少、大小，不论播种量多大，每亩的最大限度的有效穗数为七十到一百一十万之间，在决定播种量时不能超过这个限度，每亩总穗数虽然可以达到一百万左右，但它不能获得最高产量。因为这样多的穗数个体和群体失去最低限度的均衡状态，一般说以四十五到六十万为最好，个体和群体的关系得到正常发展，产量最高。每穗小麦保持一到一点五方寸的营养面积。
    合理密植应当以“主穗为主，分头为辅”。在良好的水旱地应保持有四十五到六十万穗。以碧蚂一号等中粒种，每市斤一万五千粒计算，每亩播种量应播三十五到四十五斤，最高不超过五十斤，一般水地和较好的旱地应保持有三十万到四十万穗。播种量为二十五到三十五斤，最差的旱薄地每亩应保持有二十五到三十万穗，播种量为二十到二十五斤。此外也要根据播种迟早、子粒大小、品种分头特性、土地整理好坏等具体情况决定适当增减。
    密植方法以窄行条播为最好。直接土地利用率在25％到30％，播幅与行距的比例为一比二或一比三，用五寸耧下种，一般耧播的播幅宽度不超过二寸。旱薄地的密植方法中心是缩小行距，使每粒种均匀地分布在土地上，尽力扩大单株营养面积。在肥料少的情况下为了开沟结合施肥，可以提倡宽幅条播，在撒施肥料的耧播地区，不应当提倡改宽幅耧。
