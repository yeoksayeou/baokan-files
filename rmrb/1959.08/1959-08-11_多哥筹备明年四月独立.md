　　Accra dispatch: According to a report in the "Ghana Times" on the 4th, Manigiliu, chairman of the Togo Independence Celebration Committee, said that preparations for celebrating Togo's independence are underway in Togo's capital, Lome, and other cities.
　　Togo, currently a French trust territory, will become independent in April next year.
　　The committee chairman told the "Ghana Times" reporter that approximately 500 distinguished guests will be invited to attend the celebration ceremonies. Projects scheduled for completion before independence include the construction of a hotel and some bungalows to accommodate guests from around the world, electrification of the capital, and resurfacing of major roads with asphalt.
　　He said that plans for establishing an independence monument in Lome are being drafted.
　　Under French trusteeship, the budget spent on the estimated 1.25 million Togolese residents is only about £4.5 million annually. In Togo, only about 30% of school-age children attend school; there are a total of three secondary schools and no universities. In several regions, there is only one doctor for every 100,000 to 200,000 residents. (Attached picture)

　　多哥筹备明年四月独立
    阿拉克消息：据“加纳时报”4日报道，多哥庆祝独立委员会主席曼尼吉利厄说，庆祝多哥独立的准备工作正在多哥首都洛美和其他城市进行中。
    多哥现在是法国的托管地，将在明年4月独立。
    委员会主席对“加纳时报”记者说，约有五百名贵宾将应邀前来参加庆祝典礼。预定在独立前完成的工程包括：建筑供世界各地来宾住宿的一家旅馆和一些平房，首都的电气化和把主要的道路改修为柏油马路。
    他说，在洛美建立独立纪念碑的计划正在草拟中。
    在法国的托管统治下，用在估计为一百二十五万多哥居民身上的预算每年大约只有四百五十万英镑。在多哥，现在大约只有30％的学龄儿童上学；那里一共有三所中学，没有大学。在好几个地区里，在十万到二十万名居民中只有一个医生。（附图片）
　　多哥总理奥林匹欧宣告规定多哥独立的日期后，受到人民热烈欢迎。
