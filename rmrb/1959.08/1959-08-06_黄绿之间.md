    Between Yellow and Green
    Shu Jia
    A strange thing happened in Yongshan County, Yunnan Province. Two production teams in the Jingdi Commune experienced contrasting fortunes with their mid-season rice crop. One team's rice, which had initially been lush and green, turned thin and yellow after a month. The other team's rice, which had been thin and yellow to begin with, grew green and strong after a month.
    Strange as it seems, there's a reason for the change. The key factor determining whether the rice turned from yellow to green or green to yellow was the level of enthusiasm and drive. A lack of drive caused the green rice to turn yellow, while sufficient drive caused the yellow rice to turn green.
    The strength and duration of this drive are closely related to complacency and one's perspective on the situation and the future. Complacency leads to relaxation. When people feel satisfied and think things are "good enough," their spirits become lax and sluggish. They fail to see what efforts are still needed, and their progress comes to a halt because they no longer have a compelling goal to strive for. A lack of clear understanding of the current favorable production situation and the bright future can also blur the goals and lead to a slackening of effort. The Yongjia County Committee in Yunnan recognized this and immediately convened an on-site meeting, using the contrasting experiences of the two teams over the past month to break the complacent mood of some individuals. In Tonghai County, in addition to holding on-site meetings, they also organized debates to help the masses better understand the situation and prospects for achieving even greater increases in production. These two counties quickly launched new production upsurges. A change in thinking leads to a change in drive; a change in drive leads to a change in the rice seedlings.
    Currently, the mid-season rice and autumn coarse grains in many areas are growing well. However, we must not become complacent and wait passively for a good harvest simply because a good harvest seems promising. "Promising" is not the same as "already achieved." Even if things are growing well now, they can deteriorate if management is relaxed. On the other hand, strengthened management can lead to even better growth in the future. At present, some areas have suffered relatively severe natural disasters. Disasters naturally bring difficulties. However, we must not become pessimistic and despair in the face of difficulties. As long as we summon our energy, strengthen field management, and vigorously combat disasters, there is still a great hope for a good harvest. At the very least, we can strive to minimize or avoid the impact of the disaster. In the disaster-stricken areas and areas where drought is developing, the majority of the masses have not slackened their efforts. Instead, they have launched a vigorous movement to combat disasters and drought. Many places have already achieved great victories, and the disaster situation has been alleviated in many areas. Cadres and the masses in many places have made a firm resolution: "We will ensure a good harvest even if it doesn't rain!" With such heroic spirit, we will surely be able to turn rice seedlings from yellow to green. If thoughts turn "yellow" first, the crops will also turn yellow. If thoughts remain evergreen and full of vitality, the crops will also thrive.

    黄绿之间
    蜀嘉
    奇事一桩，出在云南省永善县。这个县的井底公社有两个生产队：一个队的中稻本来长得一片碧绿，一个月后却变得又瘦又黄；另一个队的中稻本来长得又黄又瘦，一个月后却长得又绿又壮。
    奇事不奇。变，总有个道理。由黄变绿，由绿变黄，起了决定作用的还是干劲。缺干劲，绿的变黄了；干劲足，黄的变绿了。
    干劲大不大，长不长，同自满不自满有很大关系，同对形势、前途的看法也有很大关系。人一自满，就会松劲。什么都感到满足，都觉得差不多了，精神上就会松弛、疲沓下来，就看不到还需要作些什么努力，前进的脚步就会停止下来，因为前面已经没有吸引你继续奋斗的目标了。对当前生产上的有利形势和光辉的前途认识不清，奋斗的目标也会模糊不清，同样也会松劲。云南永嘉县委看清了这一点，立即召开现场会议，用两个队一个月间的变化的事实打破了一些人的松劲情绪。在通海县，除了开现场会以外还开了辩论会，使群众更清楚地认识了争取更大增产的形势和前途。这两个县很快就掀起了新的生产高潮。思想一变，干劲就变；干劲一变，禾苗就变。
    目前，不少地方的中稻、秋杂粮都长得很好。但是，千万不能因为丰收有望就松了后劲，坐等丰收。“有望”并不等于已经到手。现在长得好，放松了管理以后还会变坏；加强了管理，以后还会长得更好。目前，有一些地方遭受了比较严重的自然灾害。有灾害，当然就有困难。但是，也千万不可在困难面前悲观失望。只要鼓足干劲，加强田间管理，奋力抗灾，丰收仍然大有希望。至少，可以争取不受灾或者少受灾。受灾地区和旱情正在发展的地区，大部分群众一点也没有松劲，而是展开了轰轰烈烈的抗灾、抗旱运动，不少地方已经取得了巨大的胜利，许多地方灾情减轻了，许多地方的干部和群众立下大志：“不下雨也要保丰收！”有这样的英雄气概，就一定能使禾苗由黄变绿。思想先“黄”了，庄稼也会黄。思想长青，充满生气，庄稼也会茁壮。
