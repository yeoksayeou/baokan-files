Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 16th: A rally with three thousand people attending was held here this morning at the National Theater to warmly celebrate the thirty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the Cuban People's Socialist Party.

	This is the first time the Cuban people have publicly held such a rally after the party was in an illegal state for seven years. Slogans such as "Defend the Revolution, Advance the Revolution!" "Celebrate the 34th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Socialist Party, Long Live the People's Socialist Party!" were hung in the meeting hall and on the streets. The platform was hung with the national flag, the party flag, and portraits of the party's martyrs. When party leaders such as Juan Marinello and Blas Roca appeared, the meeting hall resounded with enthusiastic applause.

	Juan Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that in the long and arduous struggle, the party not only survived but also gained consolidation. The Communists were the most resolute in the struggle against the imperialist oppressors, and the party bravely participated in the recent armed struggle to overthrow the dictatorship. The National United Workers' Front supported the uprising, and the party was the first to propose a land reform program.

	Marinello pointed out that Cuba is now in the process of a people's, progressive, patriotic, national democratic, liberation, and anti-imperialist land revolution. The party firmly supports the revolutionary movement headed by Castro. Imperialists and large landowners are still carrying out conspiracies against the Cuban revolution, and the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas may pass resolutions that favor dictatorships and oppose Cuba. Marinello then pointed out that it is different now from the time when the imperialists overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala, because Cuba has the support of the people of Latin America and the socialist camp countries, and a united people fighting for freedom are invincible.

	Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, called on the revolutionary forces to remain vigilant in his speech. He pointed out that in the face of the threat of powerful enemies, the development of the revolution should be accelerated and land reform should be accelerated. He said that Cuba is facing a longer and more arduous economic struggle than the armed struggle. In this struggle, the weapon to fight against enemy conspiracies is to establish economic relations with socialist countries.

	Blas Roca finally called for strengthening solidarity with the "July 26th Movement" and all revolutionaries to defend and advance the revolution.

	Congratulatory messages from organizations such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the French Communist Party, and the Communist Party of the United States were received and read out at the meeting. The entire event was broadcast nationwide by Havana's television network.

	Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 15th: Juan Marinello, Chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, published an article in "Hoy" today entitled "Cuban Communists and the Anti-Imperialist Struggle" to commemorate the thirty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the Cuban People's Socialist Party.

	Marinello pointed out that the Cuban Communists, who inherited Martí's anti-imperialist tradition, have been the most steadfast anti-imperialists for thirty-four years. Marinello pointed out that the government born in the uprising led by Castro has carried out profound revolutionary activities, and it is the first product in our history of a national will that neither yields nor compromises with Washington. Therefore, imperialism attempted in the past, and now attempts, to defeat the revolution and the Castro government. Never in our past history has it been so proven as it is now that it is impossible to generate firm liberation actions that do not conflict with imperialism.

　　古巴共产党人是最坚定的反帝战士
　　哈瓦那盛大集会热烈庆祝人民社会党生日
　　马里内略指出古巴处在人民革命的过程中
    据新华社哈瓦那16日电　今天早上在这里的国民剧院举行了有三千人参加的集会，热烈地庆祝古巴人民社会党建党三十四周年。
    这是古巴人民在党处于非法状态七年之后第一次公开举行这样的集会。在会议大厅和街道上都挂着这样的标语牌：“保卫革命，推进革命！”“庆祝人民社会党建党三十四周年，人民社会党万岁！”主席台上挂着国旗、党旗和党的先烈的遗像，当胡安·马里内略、布拉斯·罗加等党的领导人出现的时候，会议厅响起了热烈的鼓掌声。
    古巴人民社会党主席马里内略在会上讲了话。他指出，在长期的艰巨斗争中党不仅保存下来，而且获得了巩固。共产党人在反对帝国主义压迫者的斗争中是最坚决的，党英勇地参加了最近推翻独裁统治的武装斗争。全国工人联合阵线支持了起义斗争，党是第一个提出土地改革的纲领的。
    马里内略指出，古巴现在正处在一个人民的、进步的、爱国的、民族民主的、解放的和反帝国主义的土地革命过程中。党坚定地支持以卡斯特罗为首的革命运动。帝国主义和大庄园主仍然要进行反对古巴革命的阴谋活动，美洲外长会议可能会通过有利于独裁政权而反对古巴的决议。马里内略接着指出，但是现在已经不同于帝国主义者推翻危地马拉民主政府的时代了，因为古巴有拉丁美洲和社会主义阵营各国人民的支持，一个为自由而斗争的团结一致的人民是不可战胜的。
    古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加在讲话中号召革命力量保持警惕。他指出，在强大的敌人的威胁面前，应该加速革命的发展，加速进行土地改革。他说，古巴面临着比武装斗争更长期更艰巨的经济斗争。在这个斗争中，同敌人阴谋作斗争的武器是和社会主义国家建立经济关系。
    布拉斯·罗加最后号召加强同“7月26日运动”以及一切革命者的团结，以保卫和推进革命。
    会上收到并且宣读了苏联共产党、法国共产党、美国共产党等组织的贺词。大会实况由哈瓦那的电视线路向全国转播。
    据新华社哈瓦那15日电　古巴人民社会党主席胡安·马里内略今天在“今日报”上发表题为“古巴共产党人和反帝国主义斗争”的文章，纪念古巴人民社会党成立三十四周年。
    马里内略指出，继承了马蒂反帝传统的古巴共产党人，三十四年来一直是最坚定的反帝国主义者。马里内略指出，在卡斯特罗所领导的起义中诞生的政府，进行了深刻的革命活动，它是我国历史上对华盛顿既不屈服又不妥协的民族意志的第一个产物。因此，帝国主义从前企图，现在也企图击败革命和卡斯特罗政府。在我们过去的历史上从来没有像现在这样证明，不可能产生不同帝国主义发生冲突的坚定的解放行动。
