Xinhua News Agency, August 19th:

　　The Ministry of Commerce recently deployed commercial work for August and September, calling on employees of commercial departments across the country to summon greater energy, seize August and September, do a good job in the peak season market purchasing and sales work, and greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding achievements.

　　The Ministry of Commerce believes that August and September have entered the peak season for the purchase of agricultural products and the supply of means of production and means of livelihood, and it is also a crucial period for completing the annual commercial work tasks. At present, a greater upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy is being launched on the industrial and agricultural production frontlines across the country, and local Party committees have strengthened their leadership over commercial work. Therefore, the situation facing commercial work is extremely favorable, and the vast majority of cadres and employees in commercial departments are full of energy and high morale. However, in recent months, some areas have encountered certain difficulties in market arrangements due to natural disasters and a shortage of certain industrial raw materials. A very small number of commercial cadres have also developed right-leaning emotions of fear of difficulty and relaxation. This kind of right-leaning emotion is very harmful. Commercial departments in various regions should, under the leadership of the local Party committee, immediately launch a study movement to enable all cadres and employees to see the current favorable situation, seize the good opportunity of August and September, muster their energy, and do their best to do a good job in peak season purchasing and supply work, and further adapt to market needs.

　　The Ministry of Commerce believes that, according to the current situation, the following tasks must be done well in August and September:

　　1. Make every effort to do a good job in the supply of disaster relief materials. Commercial departments in disaster areas should regard disaster resistance and relief as the central task and make the greatest efforts to ensure the supply of disaster relief materials. In the production and self-rescue work in disaster areas, commercial departments should assist the people in disaster areas to develop diversified operations and do a good job in the supply of raw materials and the promotion of products. Commercial departments in non-disaster areas should also actively transfer materials to support disaster areas in accordance with national arrangements.

　　2. Grasp the production, purchase, and sale of autumn vegetables. At present, the production of autumn vegetables in some provinces has been greatly affected due to drought, floods, and insect pests. Commercial departments should work with agricultural departments to mobilize the masses to drain water and rush to plant and replant on the one hand, and strengthen field management of existing vegetable fields on the other hand, striving to increase production and harvest more. Commercial departments should also do a good job in vegetable distribution, try their best to transfer a portion of vegetables to support disaster areas, and at the same time, explain the situation to the masses, call on residents to save on vegetables, and make them last.

　　3. Do a good job in the purchase of agricultural products. The current focus is on the purchase and transfer of autumn tea, second-crop hemp, and inferior tobacco. This year, cotton is growing well in most areas and may be available on the market earlier. Commercial departments in various regions must seize the opportunity to prepare for the purchase of major agricultural products, especially to seize the two basic links of improving institutions and allocating personnel, and other preparatory work should also be implemented to the grassroots units.

　　4. Do a good job in the supply of means of production and means of livelihood during the peak season. At present, commercial departments in various regions have begun to transfer means of production such as draft animals, farm implements, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers to prepare for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing. For these means of production, commercial departments should rationally allocate them according to the requirements of national economic development and considering different crops and different regions. For example, chemical fertilizers should first be used for crops such as cotton and vegetables, and then take care of others. In the work of supplying means of livelihood, we must make early arrangements for the production and supply of coal for winter heating and vigorously carry out the movement to save coal. In rural areas, commercial departments should assist people's communes to organize the masses to collect firewood and grass and store more firewood and grass to ensure winter needs.

　　5. Do a good job in the advance transportation of goods. Seize August and September to transfer out as much of the fourth quarter's materials as possible in advance. At present, we must especially seize the opportunity to transport petroleum and coal in advance.

　　商业部号召商业职工奋战八、九两月
　　做好旺季市场购销工作
    据新华社19日讯　商业部最近部署了8、9月份的商业工作，号召全国商业部门职工，鼓起更大的干劲，抓紧8、9两个月，做好旺季市场购销工作，以出色的成绩迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    商业部认为，8、9月份已经进入农产品收购和生产资料与生活资料供应的旺季，也是完成全年商业工作任务的关键时期。目前，全国工农业生产战线上正在掀起一个更大的增产节约高潮，各地党委又加强了对商业工作的领导，因此商业工作面临的形势是极为有利的，商业部门绝大部分干部和职工是干劲十足，斗志昂扬的。但是，近几个月来，有些地区由于发生了自然灾害和某些工业原料材料不足，在市场安排上遇到一定的困难，也有极少数商业干部产生了畏难松劲的右倾情绪。这种右倾情绪是非常有害的。各地商业部门应当在当地党委领导下，立即展开一个学习运动，使所有的干部和职工看清目前的有利形势，抓紧8、9月份的大好时机，鼓足干劲，全力做好旺季收购和供应工作，进一步适应市场需要。
    商业部认为，根据当前的形势，在8、9月份必须做好几件工作：
    一、全力做好抗灾物资的供应工作。灾区商业部门应当把抗灾、救灾当作中心任务，尽最大努力保证抗灾物资的供应。在灾区的生产自救工作中，商业部门应当协助灾区人民发展多种经营，作好原料供应和产品的推销等工作。非灾区的商业部门也要根据国家安排，积极调运物资支援灾区。
    二、抓好秋菜的生产和购销工作。目前部分省份由于发生旱、涝、虫灾，秋菜生产受到很大影响。商业部门要协同农业部门一方面发动群众排涝抢种和复种；一方面加强现有菜田的田间管理，力争增产多收。商业部门还应当做好蔬菜调剂工作，尽可能调运一部分蔬菜支援灾区，同时要向群众讲明情况，号召居民节约吃菜，细水长流。
    三、做好农产品收购工作。当前主要抓秋茶、二麻、下脚烟的收购和调运。今年大部分地区棉花生长良好，可能提前上市。各地商业部门必须抓紧做好主要农产品收购的准备工作，特别要抓紧健全机构、配备人员这两个基本环节，其他准备工作也要落实到基层单位。
    四、做好旺季生产资料、生活资料的供应工作。目前各地商业部门已经开始调运耕畜、农具、农药、化肥等生产资料，为秋收、秋耕、秋种作好准备。对于这些生产资料，商业部门应该根据国民经济发展的要求，并考虑到不同作物、不同地区加以合理分配。例如化肥，首先要用于棉花和蔬菜等作物，然后照顾其他。在生活资料供应工作中，要及早安排冬季防寒取暖用煤的生产和供应，并且大力开展节约用煤运动。在农村，商业部门要协助人民公社组织群众打柴拾草，储备更多的柴草，保证冬季需要。
    五、做好商品的提前运输工作。抓紧8、9两个月，把第四季度的物资尽可能地提前调运出来。当前特别要抓紧提前运输石油和煤炭。
