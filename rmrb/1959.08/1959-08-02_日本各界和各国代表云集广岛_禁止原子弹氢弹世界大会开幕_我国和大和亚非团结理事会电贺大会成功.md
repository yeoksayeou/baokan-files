Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, 1st - The Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs opened in Hiroshima today, first holding a three-day preparatory meeting. The formal meeting will begin on the 5th.

Today's preparatory meeting was attended by 100 Japanese representatives and 52 representatives from 21 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, the German Democratic Republic, West Germany, India, and five international organizations. The Soviet delegation, headed by Kovalev, Chairman of the Leningrad Peace Committee, already departed from Moscow yesterday to fly to Japan.

Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, gave a general report at the meeting. He said: The keynote of this world conference is to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs on the basis of East-West detente. He said that in discussing this issue, the most important items are: studying the harmful effects of radiation phenomena and the danger of atomic war, unconditionally and permanently banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, preventing the nuclear armament of Japan, West Germany and other countries, and establishing nuclear-free zones in Europe, Asia and the Pacific region. We will include the issue of dissolving military blocs as an important item on the agenda. He also said that the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" must be discussed by the World Conference.

Ikuo Yasui said that the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is very grateful for the enthusiastic cooperation of people from all over the world, including the People's Republic of China, in activities to aid atomic bomb victims.

French representative Dr. Viquier, British representative Arthur Goss, Ghanaian representative Quaye, Australian representative Mrs. Phyllis Latona, and Algerian representative Kiouane all spoke at the meeting, calling for the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

Japanese representative Yoshitaro Hirano said at the meeting: Japan's peace movement not only directly demands a ban on nuclear testing, but is also working to prevent U.S. forces from stationing in Japan to bring in nuclear weapons, and to prevent Japan from implementing nuclear armament. Therefore, it is currently condemning the revision of the "Security Treaty" which is closely related to nuclear armament.

Mayor of Hiroshima Shinzo Hamai delivered a welcome speech to the conference on behalf of the city of Hiroshima.

The conference received three hundred congratulatory telegrams from forty countries, including Soviet Premier Khrushchev, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, twenty international organizations, and peace organizations from countries such as China.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st - The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity sent a telegram to the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs on July 31, wishing the conference a successful victory. The telegram reads as follows: To the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs:

The Chinese people warmly congratulate the opening of the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, extend greetings to the Japanese and international friends participating in the conference who are committed to the cause of peace, and through the conference, express sincere sympathy and respect to the Japanese people who are engaged in unremitting struggle against the U.S. aggressive war policy and for independence and peace.

The American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki fourteen years ago and the post-war U.S. mad preparations for nuclear war have resulted in continuous and serious disasters for the Japanese people. The Japanese people's strong demands to ban nuclear weapons, stop nuclear weapons testing, resolutely oppose U.S. nuclear armament of Japan, and strive for independence and peace have achieved increasingly broad and in-depth development, making significant contributions to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world, and have gained enthusiastic support and response from peace-loving people all over the world.

Stopping the testing and banning the use of nuclear weapons, opposing aggression, and defending peace are the common call and strong desire of the vast majority of people in the world. However, the U.S. war group, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, not only repeatedly refuses a series of reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, hindering the Geneva conference on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing from reaching an agreement on the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing, but also expands nuclear weapons and missile bases around the world, and constantly transports various nuclear weapons into Japan, South Korea, and our country's territory of Taiwan which is occupied by the United States, as well as many places such as West Germany and Italy, and also strives to piece together new military blocs, organize nuclear war aggression systems, and intensify the tense situation. Recently, the United States and the Nobusuke Kishi group in Japan are stepping up the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," conspiring to form a U.S.-Japan military alliance, accelerating the pace of Japanese militarization and nuclear armament, and turning Japan into a U.S. nuclear war base in the Far East. Obviously, this not only directly confronts the Japanese people with the danger of new war disasters, but also seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world.

Past World Conferences Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs have played a significant role in promoting the world people's struggle to ban nuclear weapons, oppose aggression, and defend peace. We believe that this fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, with the efforts and cooperation of the Japanese people and peace fighters from all countries, will surely continue to strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, crush any sabotage conspiracy of the enemies of peace, and make new and greater contributions to the common cause of the current world people's opposition to the U.S. imperialist nuclear war policy and the defense of peace.

The Chinese people have always advocated the prohibition of nuclear weapons and opposed the threat of nuclear war, have always supported the just cause of the Japanese people in striving for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and firmly support the Japanese people's heroic struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Chinese people strongly demand the removal of all U.S. nuclear weapon bases and the withdrawal of all U.S. aggressive troops from Japan, South Korea, our territory of Taiwan, and from other regions around the world! We fully support the proposal to establish peace zones and nuclear-free zones in the Far East and the Pacific region, in Europe, and in other regions of the world. The Chinese people support all positive proposals from all sides that are conducive to peace and easing international tensions. We reiterate: The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Japanese people and all peace-loving people in the world to eliminate the threat of nuclear war, to ensure lasting world peace, and to promote friendly cooperation between the people of all countries. We firmly believe that in today's era of unprecedentedly strong world peace forces, any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism and all war forces will be thoroughly crushed by the united action of the people of all countries.

We wish the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs a successful victory!

    日本各界和各国代表云集广岛
    禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会开幕
    我国和大和亚非团结理事会电贺大会成功
    据新华社1日讯　广岛消息：第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会今天在广岛开幕，首先举行为期三天的预备会议。正式会议将从5日开始。
    今天参加预备会议的有一百名日本代表和英、法、德意志民主共和国、西德、印度等二十一个国家和五个国际组织的五十二位代表。以列宁格勒和平委员会主席科瓦廖夫为团长的苏联代表团已经在昨天从莫斯科起程飞往日本。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在会上作了总报告。他说：这次世界大会的基调是在东西方和解的基础上禁止原子弹和氢弹。他说，在讨论这项问题中，最重要的项目有：研究放射现象的有害影响和原子战争的危险性，无条件和永远地禁止原子弹和氢弹试验，禁止使用核武器，阻止用核武器武装日本、西德和其他国家以及在欧洲、亚洲和太平洋地区建立无原子武器地区。我们将把解散军事集团问题作为重要项目列入议程。他又说，关于修改日美“安全条约”问题，世界大会必须加以讨论。
    安井郁说，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会在救济原子弹受害者的活动方面受到包括中华人民共和国在内的世界各国人民的热忱合作，非常感激。
    法国代表维基埃博士、英国代表阿瑟·戈斯、加纳代表夸耶、澳大利亚代表菲利斯拉托那夫人和阿尔及利亚代表基欧安都在会上讲话，要求禁止核武器。
    日本代表平野义太郎在会上说：日本的和平运动不仅直接要求禁止核试验，而且正在努力阻止美军驻在日本以运进核武器，阻止日本实行核武装。因此，目前正在谴责同核武装有密切关系的修改“安全条约”问题。
    广岛市市长浜井信三郎代表广岛市向大会致欢迎词。
    大会收到了来自四十个国家的三百封贺电，其中包括苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫、印度总理尼赫鲁、二十个国际组织和中国等国家和平组织的贺电。
    新华社1日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会7月31日打电报给第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，预祝大会的胜利成功。电文如下：第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会：
    中国人民热烈祝贺第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的开幕，谨向参加大会的致力于和平事业的日本及各国的朋友们致意，并通过大会，向为反对美国侵略战争政策和争取独立、和平而进行不懈斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的同情和敬意。
    十四年前美国在广岛长崎投掷原子弹和战后美国疯狂准备核战争的结果，使日本人民不断蒙受严重的灾害。日本人民强烈要求禁止核武器、停止核武器试验、坚决反对美国核武装日本和争取独立、和平的强大运动，取得了愈来愈广泛和深入的发展，为远东和世界和平事业，作出了重大的贡献，得到全世界爱好和平的人民的热烈支持和响应。
    停止试验和禁止使用核武器，反对侵略、保卫和平，是全世界广大人民的一致呼声和强烈愿望。但是，美国战争集团不顾世界人民的和平意愿，不仅屡次拒绝苏联提出的一系列合理建议，阻挠日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议就立即和永远停止核武器试验问题达成协议，并且在世界各地扩建核武器和导弹基地，把各种核武器不断运进日本、南朝鲜和被美国霸占的我国领土台湾以及西德、意大利等许多地方，还竭力拼凑新的军事集团，组织核战争侵略体系，加剧紧张局势。最近，美国和日本岸信介集团正加紧修改日美“安全条约”，阴谋结成美日军事同盟，加快日本军国主义化和核武装的速度，把日本变成美国在远东的核战争基地。显然，这不仅直接使日本人民面临新的战争灾难的危险，并且还严重地威胁远东和世界和平。
    过去历届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，对于推动世界人民禁止核武器、反对侵略和保卫和平的斗争，都起了重大的作用。我们相信，这次第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，在日本人民和各国和平战士的努力合作下，定能继续加强团结，克服困难，粉碎和平敌人的任何破坏阴谋，为当前世界人民反对美帝国主义核战争政策和保卫和平的共同事业，作出新的、更大的贡献。
    中国人民一贯主张禁止核武器和反对核战争威胁，一贯支持日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的正义事业，坚决支持日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的英勇斗争。中国人民强烈要求从日本、南朝鲜，从我国领土台湾和从全世界其它地区撤销所有美国核武器基地，撤退全部美国侵略军队！我们完全支持在远东及太平洋区域，在欧洲及世界其他地区建立和平地区和无原子武器地区的建议。中国人民支持来自各方面的一切有利于和平和缓和国际紧张局势的积极建议。我们重申：中国人民愿意同日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民一道，为消除核战争威胁、为确保世界持久和平和为促进各国人民的友好合作而共同奋斗。我们深信：在世界和平力量空前强大的今天，帝国主义和一切战争势力的任何侵略阴谋，都将被各国人民团结一致的行动所彻底粉碎。
    祝第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会胜利成功！
