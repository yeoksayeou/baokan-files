From the Alum Capital, more good alum is produced.
    (Our report) The employees of the Pingyang Ming矾 (Alum) Factory Mining United Company, located in the Alum Capital of the motherland – Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province – are engaging in technical innovation on a large scale, resulting in a 33% increase in alum production during the second quarter compared to the same period last year. The quality of the products has also improved. The alum content of the "Fine Pearl" variety of alum has been raised to 70% and 80% from the original 60%, with some reaching 90%. Currently, on the highway leading from Fanshan to the foot of the mountain, trucks are transporting alum day and night to all parts of the country, supplying the needs of industry, agriculture, fishing, medicine, and other fields.

    Starting in the second quarter of this year, all employees of the company launched a production increase and economy drive centered on technical innovation. In terms of mining, various units have promoted many advanced blasting experiences, increasing the average daily mining volume per person from a maximum of 1,000 jin to more than two tons. In terms of alum refining, the first workshop improved the original road heating stove, enabling each person to produce an additional 1,000 jin of Fine Pearl alum per day. In terms of transportation, employees have added various new tools such as iron cables, bamboo rails, wooden rails, handcarts, and winches to replace carrying with shoulder poles. The second work area, through the use of wooden rail winches and iron cable transportation, saved more than 100 laborers and increased labor productivity by one to five times.

    Currently, the company is deeply carrying out the "Three Highs and One Good" (high output, high quality, high efficiency, and good safety) campaign to bring technical innovation to a new climax.

    矾都多产好明矾
    本报讯　位于祖国矾都——浙江省平阳县的平阳明矾厂矿联合公司职工大闹技术革新，第二季度生产的明矾比去年同期提高了33％。产品质量也上升了。明矾品种之一的细明珠，原来含矾率为60％，现在普遍提高到70％和80％，有的达到90％。目前，从矾山通向山下的公路上，汽车日夜不停地把明矾运向全国各地，供应着工、农、渔、医等各方面的需要。
    从今年第二季度起，这个公司全体职工掀起了一个以技术革新为中心的增产节约运动。在采矿方面，各个单位推广了许多先进爆破经验，每人每天的平均开采量从原来最多一千斤，提高到两吨多。在炼矾方面，第一车间改进原路加温灶，每人每天能多生产一千斤细明珠。在运输方面，职工们添设了铁索、竹轨、木轨、手拉车、绞车等各种新工具来代替匾担挑。第二工区由于使用木轨绞车和铁索运输等，节约一百多劳动力，劳动生产率提高一倍到五倍。
    目前，这个公司正在深入开展“三高一好”（产量高，质量高，效率高，安全好）运动，使技术革新走向新的高潮。
