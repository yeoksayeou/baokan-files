The Brilliant Victory of the Party's Ethnic Policy
Jin Minghan, Deputy Secretary of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the CPC

Since the liberation of the Yanbian area from Japanese imperialist rule on September 3, 1945, the people of all ethnic groups, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policy, have achieved great successes in politics, economy, and culture. In particular, the great victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement in 1957 propelled our prefecture's socialist construction to a new high tide. The changes experienced by the people of all ethnic groups in Yanbian in this year were the most profound and greatest, and the achievements were also the most glorious. In September 1958, in just over a month, the entire prefecture achieved the communization of the people's communes, and the original 925 agricultural production cooperatives were merged into 82 people's communes. While celebrating the communization of the people's communes, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture also achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production. The total agricultural output value in 1958 reached 135.54 million yuan, an increase of 44.2% compared to 1957. The total grain output reached 1.006 billion jin, an increase of 62.6% compared to 1957, with an average of 1,100 jin of grain per person. Since then, we have achieved self-sufficiency in grain and even had a surplus. In this year, local industry also developed rapidly. Now there are more than 200 industrial and mining enterprises of all sizes in the prefecture. In 1958, the total output value of these industrial enterprises reached more than 360 million yuan, accounting for more than 73% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. With the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's material and cultural life has also been greatly improved. In 1958, social purchasing power increased 4.8 times compared to 1949. On the basis of universal primary education in 1952, cultural education basically popularized secondary education in 1958. All school-age children can go to school, and the task of eliminating illiteracy among all people has been basically completed. It is particularly worth mentioning the development of higher education. Now there are three universities in the prefecture with 1,873 students, and an average of two university students per thousand people in the prefecture. Medical and health services have also been greatly developed. Endemic diseases that have plagued the people in various parts of the prefecture for a long time, such as Keshan disease, Kashin-Beck disease, and forest encephalitis, have almost disappeared.

Some people believe that the development speed of socialist construction in Yanbian should be slowed down because it is an ethnic minority area. Facts have proved that this is wrong. The speed is not determined by people's subjective wishes, but is based on certain prerequisites. The reason why the construction speed in Yanbian is relatively fast is primarily because Yanbian is one of the old revolutionary base areas. Since 1930, the Party has led the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Especially after 1931, the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle led by the Party spread throughout the area, and thousands of people were educated by the Party and tempered in the struggle. After the liberation of the Yanbian area in 1945, the people of all ethnic groups in the area were better educated by the Party and continuously improved their political consciousness.

Secondly, before liberation, the development of capitalism in the Yanbian area was also relatively deformed. Most of the factories were in the hands of Japanese imperialism. Japanese imperialism developed papermaking, forestry, and coal industries in Yanbian, and plundered them wantonly. Most of the land in the countryside was also controlled by Japanese imperialism, and the vast majority of peasants were slaves to Japanese imperialism and suffered greatly. Therefore, workers and peasants have strong revolutionary demands and a passionate yearning for future life.

Thirdly, resources are quite abundant, the land is fertile, water sources are abundant, and there are tens of thousands of square kilometers of virgin forest.

These conditions fully show that Yanbian can take faster steps in carrying out the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and building socialism. Under the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, we have taken steady but faster steps to carry out various tasks and have achieved brilliant results. This proves that doing so is completely correct. We rapidly carried out the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and launched the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the people's commune movement. In this way, we gradually liberated the productive forces, promoted the rapid development of production, and also promoted the development of cultural construction.

Implementing regional autonomy enables the people of all ethnic groups to achieve equality in politics, inspires everyone's political enthusiasm, and cultivates a large number of cadres among the people of all ethnic groups to establish a strong leadership core and lead the people of all ethnic groups forward. This is the decisive factor for the rapid development of various construction undertakings in Yanbian. From the day the Party started work in this area, it has always attached importance to cultivating and training ethnic minority cadres who are loyal to the Party and loyal to the interests of the people in the revolutionary struggle and production in various periods. In this way, cadre conditions were prepared for the later implementation of regional autonomy. By 1958, 9,970 ethnic minority cadres had been trained, accounting for 60.9% of the total number of cadres. Judging from the current situation, how to further improve the communist consciousness of this cadre team is still a very important issue that needs to be continuously addressed. Facts have proved that whichever department has strong Party leadership and high communist consciousness among cadres, that department's work will be carried out well. Therefore, the Party organization in Yanbian has always paid attention to educating ethnic minority cadres and improving their communist consciousness. Especially in the past year or two, great efforts have been made to improve their communist consciousness among ethnic minority cadres. This is the all-people rectification movement centered on opposing local nationalism that has been carried out in our region since 1957. Through the rectification movement, the ideological emotions of local nationalism that have grown somewhat in the Yanbian area in recent years have been or are being criticized, which has greatly improved the communist consciousness of ethnic minority cadres. Their relationship with the people of all ethnic groups is even closer.

Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups in the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause." The people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture, especially the Korean people, have realized more deeply in the actual struggles of the past ten years that, in order to accelerate socialist construction and seek the prosperity and development of their own ethnic group, they absolutely cannot do without the help of the Han people, and they absolutely cannot do without the unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture. In the past revolutionary struggles and production struggles, the Party has always proceeded from the wish of ethnic unity, advocating mutual learning, mutual assistance, unity and cooperation, and common improvement. Therefore, the friendly and cooperative relations among all ethnic groups have been continuously developed. After the communization of the people's communes, the production and life of the people of all ethnic groups are further linked together on a new economic basis, producing together, working together, and carrying out a common struggle for a common goal. This provides a more reliable guarantee for the socialist construction of our prefecture.

    党的民族政策的光辉胜利
    中共延边朝鲜族自治州委员会副书记　金明汉
    延边地区自1945年9月3日从日本帝国主义统治下解放以后，各族人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，在政治、经济和文化方面，都取得了巨大成就。特别是1957年反右派斗争和整风运动的伟大胜利，把我州的社会主义建设事业推向了新的高潮。在这一年里，延边各族人民所经历的变化，是最深刻、最伟大的，取得的成就也是最辉煌的。1958年9月，在仅仅一个多月的时间里，全州就实现了人民公社化，原有九百二十五个农业生产合作社合并成立了八十二个人民公社。全州各族人民在欢庆人民公社化的同时，并取得了农业生产的全面大丰收。1958年农业总产值达到了一亿三千五百五十四万元，比1957年增加44.2％。粮食总产量达到了十亿零六千万斤，比1957年提高62.6％，每人平均有粮食一千一百斤。从此做到了粮食自给有余。在这一年里，地方工业也有了飞速的发展。现在全州大大小小的工矿企业有二百多个。1958年这些工业企业总产值达到了三亿六千多万元，占工农业总产值的73％以上。随着工农业生产的大发展，人民的物质文化生活也有了极大的提高。1958年社会购买力，比1949年提高四点八倍。文化教育，在1952年普及小学教育的基础上，1958年又基本上普及了中等教育，所有适龄儿童都能够升学，并且基本上完成了全民扫盲任务。特别值得提出的是高等教育的发展。现在全州有三所大学，学生一千八百七十三名，全州每一千人中平均就有二名大学生。医疗卫生事业，也有很大的发展。流行州内各地危害人民已久的地方病如克山病、大骨节病、森林脑炎等病，已近绝迹。
    对延边社会主义建设事业的发展速度，有些人认为，它是少数民族地区，速度应该放慢些。事实证明，这是不对的。速度的快慢，这不是人的主观愿望所决定的，是以一定的前提条件为基础的。延边的建设速度所以比较快，这首先由于延边是革命老根据地之一。从1930年开始，党就在这里领导州内各族人民进行反帝反封建的斗争，特别是1931年以后，党所领导的抗日斗争的烽火燃遍了全区，成千上万的人民群众，受到了党的教育，在斗争中受到了锻炼。1945年延边地区解放后，全区各族人民又更好地获得了党的教育，不断提高了政治觉悟。
    其次，解放前，延边地区资本主义发展也较畸形，大部分工厂都掌握在日本帝国主义手里。日本帝国主义在延边发展了造纸、森林、煤炭工业，大肆掠夺；农村的大部分土地也控制在日本帝国主义手里，绝大部分农民给日本帝国主义当奴隶，受苦极深。因此，工人和农民有着强烈的革命要求，并且对未来的生活有着热烈的向往。
    再次，资源相当丰富，土地肥沃，水源充足，并且有着数万平方公里的原始森林。
    这些条件充分地说明，延边在进行民主革命、社会主义革命和在建设社会主义的过程中，可以采取较快的步骤。我们在省委的指示下，采取了稳妥而较快的步骤，开展了各项工作，取得了辉煌的成就。这就证明，这样做是完全正确的。我们迅速进行了民主革命和社会主义革命，开展了农业互助合作运动和人民公社化运动。这样，就逐步解放了生产力，促进了生产的迅速发展，也促进了文化建设的发展。
    实行区域自治，使各族人民在政治上取得平等，激发大家的政治热情；并在各族人民群众中培养出大批干部，建立坚强的领导核心，带动各族人民前进。这是延边各项建设事业迅速发展的决定因素。党从在这个地区开辟工作那天起，在各个时期的革命斗争和生产中，一直重视培养锻炼忠于党、忠于人民利益的民族干部。这样，给后来实行区域自治准备了干部条件。到1958年，已培养了民族干部九千九百七十名，占干部总数的60.9％。从现在的情况看，如何进一步提高这支干部队伍的共产主义觉悟，还是一个很重要的需要继续努力解决的问题。事实证明，哪个部门党的领导强，干部的共产主义觉悟高，哪个部门的工作就开展得好。因此，延边的党组织一直是注意教育民族干部，提高他们的共产主义觉悟的。特别是在近一两年来，在民族干部中大力进行了提高他们共产主义觉悟的工作。这就是从1957年以来，在我们地区所进行的以反对地方民族主义为中心的全民整风运动。通过整风运动，对近几年来在延边地区有所滋长的地方民族主义的思想情绪，已经进行了或正在进行着批判，大大提高了民族干部的共产主义觉悟。他们与各民族人民的关系更加密切了。
    毛主席说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证”。州内各族人民，特别是朝鲜族人民在十几年来的实际斗争中，越发深刻地认识到，要加快社会主义建设，求得本民族的繁荣发展，绝对离不开汉族的帮助，绝对离不开州内各族人民的团结合作。在历次的革命斗争和生产斗争中，党一直是从民族团结这样一个愿望出发，提倡互相学习，互相帮助，团结合作，共同提高。因此，各族人民的友爱合作关系，得到了不断发展。人民公社化以后，进一步把各族人民的生产和生活在新的经济基础上联结在一起，共同生产，共同劳动，为共同的目标进行着共同的斗争。这就使我州的社会主义建设有了更为可靠的保证。
