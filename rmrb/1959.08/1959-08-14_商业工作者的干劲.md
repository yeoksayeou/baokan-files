The entire economic front is carrying out a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. Commercial work is an important part of China's national economy. In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, commercial workers should also summon up their drive, oppose rightward tendencies, and strive to complete this year's leap forward plan and further improve market conditions.

How should commercial workers summon up their drive and practice rigorous economy? From the basic tasks of commercial work, the main thing is to do a good job in purchasing and sales. Purchasing industrial products, agricultural and sideline products, and local specialties; selling various means of production and means of livelihood; serving production and serving the people's livelihood. We often say that commerce is the link between production and consumption, which refers to these tasks. However, whether it truly becomes a link depends on the drive of commercial workers and how the work is done. Setting up a purchasing station in a mountainous area may result in the collection of many local specialties, or it may result in very few; selling goods may satisfy the masses, or it may not be satisfactory enough; signing a production and sales contract may result in full execution, or it may not be well executed, or even become a mere scrap of paper. Why? This lies in whether commercial workers have made their greatest subjective efforts to overcome objective difficulties.

Commodities are produced; production is the basis of commodity circulation. Only when production is good and more is produced can the procurement and supply of goods be done better and the needs of consumption be met. Commercial workers can have two attitudes towards production. One is to let it be, you produce, I purchase, if you produce more, I purchase more, if you produce less, I purchase less. This passive, waiting approach not only lacks certainty in completing the procurement tasks in terms of quantity, but it is also difficult to guarantee the variety and quality. The other is the approach of Wu Lian County in Shandong: Summon up drive, be proactive, grasp procurement from production, assist production, and organize sources of goods. Before signing a contract, help the masses arrange production, help solve the difficulties encountered by the masses in production, supply seeds, spread technology, find raw materials, and so on. The experience of Wu Lian County proves that procurement work can only be carried out smoothly by being full of drive, starting from production, and thinking of every possible way to cultivate sources of goods. Of course, this will add a lot of trouble, but this kind of trouble is necessary to do a good job in procurement work.

Commercial workers should also be good quartermasters for the people. The production of goods depends on people, on the masses, and the object of commodity sales is also people, the masses. Therefore, to do a good job in purchasing and sales, we must face the masses and be good quartermasters for the masses. Without the spirit of being a quartermaster for the masses, without always thinking of providing convenience to the masses everywhere, then the purchasing and sales work will not be done well. The fact that the commercial workers in Wu Lian County often spend most of their time going deep into the masses to understand their needs and make timely supply arrangements, being full of drive and not being afraid of hard work, demonstrates the characteristics of the people's quartermasters. The socialist competition launched by more than 300 stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, developing business characteristics, increasing variety, improving service quality, and improving service attitude, also fully demonstrates the revolutionary drive and the characteristics of the people's quartermasters of the employees of these stores.

The commercial work in Wu Lian County has been very effective and has been praised by the Party committee and the masses; the practices of the stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai have also been welcomed by the masses. It seems that the commercial workers in Wu Lian County and on Nanjing Road in Shanghai do not have any secrets, they are just full of drive, brave in overcoming difficulties, and thinking about production and consumption in every possible way. However, although this is not a secret, it is still a direction of learning for commercial workers who have not yet "gotten the hang of it", and they need to speed up and catch up.

　　商业工作者的干劲
　　司马进
    整个经济战线上正在开展着轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。商业工作是我国国民经济的重要组成部分，在增产节约运动中，商业工作人员也应该鼓足干劲、反对右倾，为完成今年的跃进计划，争取市场情况的进一步好转而斗争。
    商业工作者应当怎样鼓足干劲，厉行增产节约？从商业工作的基本任务来说，主要是做好收购和销售工作。收购工业产品、农副产品、土特产品，销售各种生产资料和生活资料，为生产服务和为人民生活服务。我们常说商业是生产和消费的纽带，就是指这些工作。但是，是否真正成为纽带，还要看商业工作人员的干劲如何，看工作怎样做。在山区设一个收购站，可能收到很多土特产品，也可能收得很少；出售商品，可能为群众所满意，但也可能不够满意；签订一份产销合同，结果可能完全执行，但也可能执行得不好，甚至变成一纸空文。为什么？这就在于商业工作人员是不是尽了自己主观上的最大努力，克服了客观存在的困难。
    商品是生产出来的；生产是商品流通的基础。只有生产得好了，生产得多了，商品的采购和供应工作才能做得更好，才能满足消费的需要。对待生产，商业工作人员可以有两种态度。一是听之任之，你生产，我采购，生产得多，就多采购，生产得少，就少采购。这种被动、等待的作法，不仅在完成采购任务的数量上没有把握，在品种、质量上也很难保证。另一种是山东五莲县的作法：鼓足干劲，积极主动，从生产中抓采购，协助生产，组织货源。在签订合同之先，帮助群众安排生产，群众在生产中遇到困难，帮助解决，供应种籽，传播技术，寻找原料，等等。五莲县的经验证明：只有干劲十足，从生产出发，想尽各种办法培植货源，采购工作才开展得顺利。当然，这样做会增加不少麻烦，但这种麻烦却是作好采购工作所必需的。
    商业工作人员还要当好人民的勤务员。商品的生产要靠人，靠群众，商品销售的对象也是人，是群众。因此，作好采购和销售工作，就要面向群众，给群众当好勤务员。没有给群众当勤务员的精神，不时时想到处处给群众以便利，那末，采购和销售工作就不会做好。五莲县商业工作人员经常以绝大部分时间深入群众，了解群众的需要，及时作好供应工作，干劲十足，不辞辛劳，就表现了人民勤务员的特色。上海市南京路三百多家商店开展社会主义竞赛，发扬经营特色，增加花色品种，提高服务质量，改进服务态度，也充分表现了这些商店职工的革命干劲和人民勤务员的特色。
    五莲县的商业工作作得很有成效，受到党委和群众的表扬；上海南京路各商店的作法也受到群众的欢迎。看来，五莲县和上海南京路的商业工作人员并没有什么窍门，只是干劲十足，勇于克服困难，千方百计为生产为消费着想而已。可是，这虽然不是窍门，但对还没有“入窍”的商业工作人员来说，却仍是一个学习的方向，需要快马加鞭，迎头赶上。
