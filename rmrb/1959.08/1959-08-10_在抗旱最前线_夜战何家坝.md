    On the Anti-Drought Front Lines
    Night Battle at Hejiaba
    On the evening of July 18th, the sky was cloudless, and a full moon illuminated the earth. At this time, on Hejiaba in the Xianxia Brigade of the Banshan Commune in Liling County, Hunan, a chorus of "Ah-ho" could be heard from afar. It turned out that Comrade Yan Xueyan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Hejiaping Production Team, was leading eighty-three commune members in an intense battle to build a dam to save more than one hundred mu of drought-stricken paddy fields.

    The commune members were full of energy. The sound of hoes, singing, and "Ah-ho" cries echoed across the dam, creating a lively atmosphere. Challenge competitions between groups and individuals were in full swing, with each commune member vying to be a vanguard in digging fast, loading fast, and walking fast. The woman Su Zaiyun carried over a hundred catties in each load, and even though she was drenched in sweat, she refused to take a break. The women's team leader, Liao Haiyun, advised her, "Take a break! Don't exhaust yourself." She replied, "To make the late rice compete with the early rice, we have to sweat more. Wet clothes don't matter; if a single rice plant dies from drought, we'll harvest less grain."

    Midnight passed. Secretary Yan, fearing that the commune members would damage their health, repeatedly suggested that everyone go back to rest and come back in the morning. The commune members agreed verbally, but no one was willing to leave the front line, only to hear a loud chorus of slogans: "If the dam foundation isn't successful, we will definitely not retreat! We'd rather stay up all night than fail to conquer the drought!" Everyone was truly ambitious and full of fighting spirit.

    The moon slowly set towards the west, and the belly of the fish appeared in the east. At this time, a dam foundation ten meters long, two point seven meters wide, and five point three meters high was successfully built. The commune members opened the culvert, and the surging water flowed into the fields along the stream. How happy everyone was! They jumped up with joy. Commune member Wen Tingying said it well: "With this dam, these hundred-plus mu of land will no longer be afraid of drought." (Zhao Zhuliang)

    在抗旱最前线
    夜战何家坝
    7月18日晚上，天空没有一丝云，圆圆的明月照着大地。这时，湖南醴陵县板杉公社仙霞大队的何家坝上，远远就听得一片啊嗬声，原来是何家坪生产队的党分支部书记颜雪岩同志，带着八十三名社员，为了抢救受旱的一百多亩稻田，正在投入紧张的筑坝战斗。
    社员们干劲十足。大坝上锄头声、唱歌声、呵嗬声响成一片，热热闹闹，组与组、人与人的挑战竞赛搞得热火朝天，社员们个个都争着做挖土快、上土快、走得快的尖兵。妇女苏再云每担都有一百多斤，挑得满身大汗，都不肯歇息一下。妇女队长廖海云劝她说：“歇一歇吧！莫一下子把身体累坏了。”她回答说：“要晚稻赛早稻，就要多出几身汗，汗湿了衣裳没关系，干死一蔸禾就得少打粮食。”
    半夜过去了。颜书记怕社员们累坏身体，多次提出要大家回去休息，等天亮再来搞，社员们口里答应，可是那个也不肯下火线，只听得一片宏亮口号声：坝基不成功，一定不收兵；宁肯一晚不睡，定要战胜干旱。一个个真是雄心勃勃，斗志昂扬。
    月亮慢慢地往西边落去，东方现出了鱼肚色的光亮。这时，一座十米长、二点七米宽、五点三米高的坝基筑成功了。社员们扯开了涵洞，只见滔滔不绝的坝水顺着小溪流进田中，大家多么高兴啊！一个个欢喜得跳起来，社员文庭英说得好、有了这座坝，这一百多亩田就再不怕干了。　（赵柱良）
