Xinhua News Agency, August 4th, dispatch from TASS on August 3rd: The upcoming mutual visits between Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, and US President Eisenhower have aroused great interest in all circles of the US capital. The announcement of the visits has become the focus of attention in Washington political circles, especially the US Congress. American radio and television stations consider this to be "news of historical significance." This announcement has been well received by the general public in the United States, who view the mutual visits of the two heads of government as a good omen for easing international tensions.

Many members of Congress issued special statements immediately after Eisenhower's press conference regarding the upcoming mutual visits between the heads of the Soviet and American governments. The vast majority of the statements believe that these mutual visits will be a major event conducive to enhancing mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Fulbright said: "These mutual visits will help the Russian leaders better understand the United States, and also help American leaders better understand the Soviet Union. This visit undoubtedly conforms to our agreement with the Russians on various exchanges, and I welcome Mr. Khrushchev's visit."

Republican leader in the Senate, Dirksen, also expressed agreement with and support for these mutual visits. Dirksen gave a high evaluation of Eisenhower's decision to invite Khrushchev to visit the United States and personally visit the Soviet Union. Dirksen hopes that these mutual visits will lead to the easing of international tensions.

Mansfield, an influential member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed enthusiastic support for the upcoming visits. He said he "fully supports" the President's decision and called on members of Congress not to adopt "some narrow partisan views" in their attitude towards these mutual visits.

Democratic Senator Symington said: "The mutual visits are wise and constructive... much can be gained." Senator Sparkman called the upcoming visits of the two government leaders "an excellent thing" and expressed "particular satisfaction" that Eisenhower will visit the Soviet Union.

Senate Democratic Leader Johnson said, "These mutual visits may bring much to the world."

According to a report by "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Irwin, the American governors meeting in San Juan (Puerto Rico) applauded the news about the mutual visits between the heads of the Soviet and American governments. Governor Sawyer said that he would be very happy if Khrushchev visited Nevada. Governor Stratton told reporters: "If Khrushchev visits Illinois, we will be very fortunate." American newspapers reported that many residents and officials in Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, and other states have invited Khrushchev to visit their cities and farms during his visit to the United States.

Washington newspapers have published this news in the most prominent positions.

The "New York Post" wrote, "Khrushchev's visit to the United States will actually be the first bilateral summit meeting between the heads of government of the world's two largest countries." The newspaper called Khrushchev's upcoming visit to the United States "an unprecedented event in the history of East-West relations."

The "New York Herald Tribune" said in an editorial that the mutual visits of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Khrushchev and US President Eisenhower "may become the basis for better mutual understanding between the two countries, and better mutual understanding will strengthen mutual respect."

The "New York Times" pointed out in an editorial that the news about the mutual visits of the two leaders "has been widely approved, even warmly welcomed, in the United States and abroad."

Commentator Lippmann of the "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out: "This mutual visit is a far-reaching and sensational event. It marks a planned shift in the Eisenhower administration's strategy itself."

At the same time, some newspapers pointed out in their reports that some people in the United States are worried that the easing of tensions between the two countries caused by the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower "may lead to a weakening of American Cold War efforts."
