Harvest Diary
Tu Yixun, Deputy Secretary of the Anyi County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province

July 13th

In just a few days, the yield figures have been changing one after another. When the Baishu (Cypress) team began harvesting, the average yield per mu of the harvested fields was more than 400 jin. Later, some fields yielded more than 500 jin per mu, and recently many fields have exceeded 600 jin, and there have even been plots yielding 1,000 jin. Commune members are talking about the bumper harvest at the edge of the fields, under the shade of trees, in the canteen, and on the threshing floor, especially discussing the milling of new grain most enthusiastically.

In order to test the quality of the new grain, female commune members Wang Dongnv and Zhang Wangmei specially used the newly made earthen mill to grind one hundred jin of new grain. Pearl-like rice grains fell from the millstones, each grain intact. Originally, everyone thought that 67 or 68 jin of rice per hundred jin of grain was the old standard, and 70 jin of rice would be heavenly. This one hundred jin of grain yielded 72 jin of snow-white rice, like rice from a modern mill. As they talked, they turned the topic to Uncle Shunshui.

Uncle Shunshui is sixty years old, and his eyes are a bit failing. He is an "old hand" at farming. Perhaps because he is "old," he feels that the new technical measures, such as deep plowing and rational close planting, are not in accordance with the old ways. Helplessly, he couldn't persuade the majority of the commune members, so he had to follow along. Before the harvest, when others said the crops were growing well, he would either give a cold laugh or curl his lip. After the harvest began, the yield became higher and higher, and he still didn't acknowledge the benefits and effects of the new technical measures, but instead thought that more fertilizer meant less rice per grain.

The news that one hundred jin of new grain yielded 72 jin of rice was like a bright light in the dark night, making his eyes light up. He saw the complete, clean, and white rice grains with his own eyes. Although he was stubborn and never said he would admit defeat, he sincerely said from the bottom of his heart: "I don't know what's going on, this year's early rice grain is so plentiful, and the grains are so full."

At this time, I realized how much immense encouragement, propaganda, and educational power a bumper harvest has. It is ten thousand times stronger than talking until your mouth is dry.

July 15th

The sun is like fire, baking on the body with a scorching heat. In the afternoon, the southerly wind stopped, and the sultry air made it difficult to breathe. The sweat on the bodies of those transplanting late rice in the fields flowed like oil being squeezed out.

The members of the first group of the fifth team of the Baishu Brigade were rushing to plant late rice in the "Four Dou Half" field. Several male and female commune members lined up in a row. Old commune member Xiong Mujin stood in the middle. He walked down into the field, and his feet made a "gugu" sound in the mud. He casually untied a bundle of seedlings, looked at the fertilizer and water in the field, and said happily to himself, "This rice is planted on tofu, you could say." Young commune member Xiong Jiasong echoed him. I knew that the commune members were full of confidence and hope for an even greater bumper harvest of late rice. I pretended to be confused and asked, "Will there be a good harvest of late rice this year?" This opened Xiong Mujin's floodgates: "To have a bumper harvest of late rice, you need water, fertilizer, and the right season. We don't have to worry about water here. As for the fertilizer problem, we've buried all the rice straw, leaving none behind. We're starting to plant now, so won't the late rice grow well!"

Speaking of fertilizer, I couldn't help but think of the late rice planting here last year. There was enough water here, and the season was early, but there wasn't enough fertilizer. For a bumper harvest of late rice, it was a case of "everything is ready except the east wind." Last year, someone suggested returning the rice straw to the field, but he strongly opposed it, saying that rice straw had no fertilizer. Most of the commune members said they wanted to bury it, so he reluctantly did it. He complained while doing it, saying that it couldn't be plowed in, that the straw got tangled and couldn't be buried, and that if it was buried before it rotted, it would be difficult to plant, hurt the hands, and cause the seedlings to rot if planted on the straw. But what was the result? The rice that was buried grew a head taller than the rice that wasn't. The facts educated him. This year, he didn't object, and he was quite active in returning the rice straw to the field. This incident also educated me. Educating farmers requires a long-term and patient approach. You can't be too impatient. Through living facts, even the most stubborn people will change.

July 16th

Around noon, the commune members were all taking a nap. I re-read a Tang poem recorded in my diary last year about rushing to harvest and plant, "Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat dripping onto the soil beneath the millet, who knows that every single grain on our plate is the result of bitter toil," which reminded me of a girl picking up rice ears a few days ago.

One morning a few days ago, the morning glow reddened the earth, and the golden rice sea looked particularly beautiful. In Xinyan, above Baishu Village, a group of children were watching cattle. A child named Xiong Shuiju, who was about ten years old, saw scattered rice grains and three or five ears of grain in a harvested field. Shuiju had heard the teacher at school say that we should cherish food and ensure that every grain is stored in the granary. She silently picked them up and wrapped them in her clothes. In more than a dozen fields, she picked up a large handful of rice ears, estimated to be one or two jin. The children following behind Shuiju, including Xiong Bangwen, also picked up rice ears. They hopped and jumped and handed all the rice ears they had picked up to the team. The team cadre promptly composed a few rhymes to praise them. I also recalled the scenes of wasted grain during last year's harvest, such as grains falling in the fields, grains flying from the threshing buckets, ears being lost on the road, and pigs and chickens trampling on and wasting grains on the threshing floor. This year, thanks to early preparation for the summer harvest, good tools, and unified hearts, the crops were harvested cleaner, packed cleaner, and less was lost. Everyone cared about the grain entering the granary, so there was even less waste of grain.

July 18th

There are still five days until the Great Heat. In principle, the Zhongzhou Brigade, located in a region of the Longjin Commune with few fields and a large labor force, where each worker is only responsible for a little more than five mu of double-cropping rice, used to be at the forefront of the entire commune in completing any production task. But now, in the rush-harvesting battle report, it ranks tenth in the entire commune, which is strange. Could it be that the enthusiasm is insufficient, and the labor force is not highly concentrated? No wonder the commune secretary openly criticized them by name in telephone conferences or when meeting cadres from the Zhongzhou Brigade, asking why the harvesting progress was so slow.

In the afternoon, I went to the Zhongzhou Brigade specifically. It happened that the stationed cadre Zou Daozhong, the branch secretary Zhan Meiguo, and the brigade leader Zhan Xianggen were holding a meeting by the field, worrying about the slow harvesting progress of the entire brigade and being criticized by the commune, sighing and mumbling, "We intentionally applied less fertilizer this winter to prevent the crops from growing too tall, so that we could only harvest one clump with each scythe, and couldn't find the knack. The commune members blamed us for being too serious about production and getting thin from the grain. We can only blame ourselves for being too concerned about production. Next year's early rice, we'll let it grow so poorly that a horse can walk without its feet touching the crops (meaning the crops will grow poorly), and we guarantee it will be harvested in three to five days." I saw that they were complaining that the higher-ups didn't understand the actual situation, so I said to them, "You can't say these irresponsible things to the people. If there's any situation, you should truthfully report it to the commune Party committee." Then they all talked about the harvesting situation of the teams they were responsible for: The Xia Yuan team had a field of 1.2 mu that took four male laborers and eight female laborers an entire afternoon. It was like "catching lice" in the field. The stalks were as tall as a person's shoulder, and the grains were like a layer spread on the field. When harvesting, they used the tip of the sickle to hook one clump at a time. Harvesting three or five clumps would yield a handful. When threshing, the grains fell like a heavy rain. After threshing more than a dozen handfuls, the bottom of the threshing bucket was buried in grain. The commune members' faces and bodies were covered with mud and sweat, but they said that the more they harvested, the more they enjoyed it. The labor force had long been highly concentrated, and 100% of the manpower had been mobilized. I had participated in the first few days of harvesting in the Zhongzhou Brigade. The stalks were long and the grains were dense, and the crops were all leaning over. The labor required to harvest one mu this year was equal to two and a half mu last year. I said to them with a smile, "Whether it's a black cat or a white cat, a cat that catches mice is a good cat. Although the progress may not be the first now, if the early rice yield can be the first, then you'll be praised everywhere." This made everyone laugh.

It was almost nine o'clock, and a gust of cool wind blew, and the moonlight illuminated the earth as if it were daytime. Large groups of male and female commune members were submerged in the rows of rice, and only the "shasha" sound of harvesting rice could be heard. Looking out from the moonlight, a large expanse of golden rice sea seemed to be in the Zhongzhou Brigade. Even with soaring enthusiasm, the early rice would never be harvested completely.

July 25th

The stars were blinking in the high sky. It was almost midnight, and although I was a bit tired, I had to cheer myself up in order to seize the time to write the next work plan. Sometimes I drank a few sips of the strong tea I had already brewed, and sometimes I took a few puffs of a cigarette. Fortunately, this battle—the summer harvest and planting—has basically ended.

Old Comrade Wang, who shares a bed with me, was sleeping soundly and snoring sweetly. I took a closer look at him by the light of the kerosene lamp. I saw that his dark face was shining, his round cheeks were much thinner, his beard was covered with stubble, and his hair hadn't been combed for a long time, like a chicken coop. His arms were pitch black, his shoulders had a thin layer of peeling skin, and his arms, back, and thighs were tanned by the sun to a steel-black color. Look, how sweetly and deeply he sleeps!

He diligently and conscientiously grasps every link of production, and never knows fatigue. It's as if he has a "generator" installed in his body. It's not just Old Comrade Wang. At this time, countless past events flooded into my mind: the old leaders who constantly educated and guided me, making me stronger and stronger; the comrades who had worked, studied, and labored with me; and the peasants I had personally seen who had become strong rural cadres today. How much wisdom and strength they had contributed during the first early rice bumper harvest of the commune. Today's fruitful results also have their share of heat and light….

How many kinds of forces have created this year's early rice bumper harvest? This is the victory of the Party's correct leadership, the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system, the eight-character charter for agriculture, the diligent labor of countless commune members, and the arduous work of rural cadres. How much experience there is to be summarized!

I thought to myself: Let those unnamed, down-to-earth grassroots cadres who live and work with the commune members take a good rest on the night the rush-harvesting and planting ends! Let them sleep comfortably and sweetly, so that they have the energy to meet the new combat tasks that are coming. So, in order not to wake Old Wang, I had to tiptoe to the side of the bed and go to sleep.

　　丰收日记
    中共江西省安义县委副书记　涂益训
　　七月十三日
    仅仅几天时间，产量数字一个不同一个。柏树小队开镰时，收刈过的田平均亩产四百多斤，后来有的田亩产五百多斤，最近不少田已冲过六百斤，还出现了千斤丘。社员们在田头边，树荫下，食堂里，禾坪上，都是在谈论丰收，特别是谈砻新谷的事最热烈。
    为了试试新谷质量，女社员王冬女、张旺妹特意将新打的土砻，秤了一百斤新谷在砻着。珍珠般的米粒从砻齿中掉出来，粒粒完整。原先大家认为一百斤谷碾六十七、八斤米是老谱子，七十斤米就登了天。这一百斤谷，碾到七十二斤雪白的像三机米样。他们谈来谈去，将话题转到顺水叔头上。
    顺水叔，六十岁了，眼睛已经有些不方便，作田是“老内行”，大概正因为是“老”的关系，对新的技术措施，什么深耕，什么合理密植，都感到不是按老谱子办事，无奈是拗大多数社员不过，只好跟着做。未收刈前，别人都说禾长得好，他不是冷冷笑一声，就是撇撇嘴。开镰收刈了，产量越来越高，他还不承认新技术措施的好处和作用，反而认为肥多了是谷多米少。
    一百斤新谷砻出七十二斤米的消息像黑夜的明灯一样，使他的眼睛亮了。他亲眼看到完整、洁白米粒，尽管他性格倔强，从不说愿输的话，可是也心服口服的说了良心话：“不知什么鬼，今年早禾谷这样多，谷粒又饱。”
    这时，我才体会到，丰收有多么巨大的鼓舞、宣传、教育的力量，这比你谈破嘴皮要强万倍。
　　七月十五日
    太阳像火一样，晒在身上热辣辣地咬人，下午南风也息了，闷热的空气，使人喘不过气来，在田里插晚秧的人身上的汗水，就像榨油样，往外淌流。
    柏树大队第五小队第一组的社员们，都在“四斗半”田里抢栽晚禾。男女社员几人一字排开。老社员熊沐金，站在中间。他走下田去，脚一踩下，田里泥咕咕直叫。他随手解开一捆秧，看了田里的肥水，高兴地自言自语说着：“这禾不如说是栽在豆腐上。”青年社员熊家松也随声附和。我知道社员们对晚禾更大丰收，充满了信心和希望。我故意装糊涂地问道：“今年晚禾会有好收成么？”这下可把熊沐金的话匣子打开了：“晚禾要丰收，靠水，靠肥，靠季节。水，我们这里不发愁，肥料的问题，把稻草全部扎下去，一根没留，季节现在就动手栽，还不长好晚禾呀！”
    他谈到肥料，不禁使我想起去年这里栽晚禾的事，这里水是足，季节也早，就是肥不够，对晚禾丰收来说是，“万事俱备，只欠东风”。去年也有人提议稻稿还田，他却竭力反对，说禾秆没有什么肥。大多数社员说要扎下去，他只好勉强着做，一边做一边埋怨，又是耕不入，又是禾秆缠辘辘扎不下，扎下去了，还没沤烂，就抢着栽下去，非怪插不入，栽痛了手，栽在禾秆上会沤死的。但是结果怎样呢？扎了的比没扎的禾要高一个头。事实教育了他，今年他不反对了，对稻稿还田还挺积极呢。这件事也教育了我自己，教育农民，需要长期和耐心，不能操之过急。通过活生生事实，再顽固的人，也会转变过来。
　　七月十六日
    晌午时候，社员们都午睡了，我重新翻起去年抢收抢插记在日记本上的“锄禾日当午，汗滴禾下土，谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”的一首唐诗来，使我联想起前几天一个女孩子捡谷穗的事来。
    前两天的一个早上，朝霞映红了大地，金黄的稻海显得格外美丽。在柏树村上边新堰，一群孩子在那里看牛，有位十几岁的孩子熊水菊，在一丘已经收刈的空田内，看见田里还有零零碎碎的谷粒，和三、五根成串的谷穗，散落田中。水菊在学校里曾听老师讲过，要爱惜粮食，要颗粒归仓，她就不声不响地捡起来，用衣服包着，在十多丘田中就捡到禾穗一大把，估计有一、二斤。跟在水菊后边的熊邦文那一批小孩子，也跟着捡起谷穗来，他们连蹦带跳将所捡的谷穗全交给队里。小队干部及时编了几句顺口溜表扬了他们。我又想起去年收刈时田内掉谷、打禾桶飞谷、路上丢穗、禾坪上猪鸡糟蹋浪费谷粒的情景。今年由于夏收准备的早，工具好，人心齐，刈得净，装得净，丢失却少了，人人都关心颗粒进仓，那浪费粮食现象就更少更少了。
　　七月十八日
    离大暑还有五天了，按道理来讲，中洲大队所在的地区是龙津公社田少劳力多的地区，每个劳动力只负担双季稻五亩多点，以前是完成任何生产任务都站在全公社最前边，可是现在在抢收战报上，却站在全公社第十位，这就令人奇怪了。莫非是干劲不足，劳力没有高度集中？无怪公社书记在电话会上或碰到中洲大队干部时，就指名公开批评，为什么收刈进度这么缓慢？
    下午，我特意到中洲大队去，恰逢驻队干部邹道忠，支部书记占美果，大队长占象艮三人正在田边开碰头会，为全大队收刈进度缓慢，受到公社批评在发愁，唉声叹气，口内叽叽咕咕：“我们今年冬天有意少撒些肥，免得禾长得磨天磨地，一镰只刈一兜，窍门又找不到，社员怪我们对生产太认真，被谷累瘦了。我们只有怪自己对生产太抓紧了，明年早禾我们让他长个马走不碰脚（意思禾长得差），三五天内保证刈完。”我看到他们是在埋怨上边不了解实情，就对他们说：“不能说这些对人民不负责任的话，有什么情况，应忠实地向公社党委反映。”接着他们都谈起自己所负责的小队的收刈情况：霞垣小队有块一亩二分的田，花了一个下午，去了四个男整劳力，八个女劳力，简直是在田里“捉虱”。秆有人肩高，谷粒像铺在田里一层，刈禾时，将镰尖勾一兜，刈一兜，刈三、五兜就有一把。打禾时，谷粒就像暴雨洒下，打十多把，打禾桶底就被谷埋没了。社员脸上、身上都是泥点、汗珠，还说越刈越有味。劳力早就高度集中，百分之百的人力都已出动了。中洲大队最初收刈的几天我曾参加过，秆长谷密，禾全部倾斜，今年刈一亩所费的工等于去年两亩半。我笑着对他们说：“乌狸猫，白狸猫，咬着老鼠是好猫。进度目前不能站第一，早禾产量能站第一，那时你们到处要受表扬。”说得大家都笑起来。
    快九点钟了，阵阵凉风吹来，月光照耀得大地如同白昼，成批成群的男女社员在禾行中淹没掉，只听得“沙沙沙”地刈禾声响。我从月色中望去，远远一大片金黄色的稻海，似乎在中洲大队，虽有冲天干劲，早稻永远也难刈完。
　　七月二十五日
    星星在高空中眨着眼。快半夜了，我虽然有些疲倦，为了抓紧时间写出下步工作计划，只好打着精神干，有时喝几口早已泡好的浓茶，有时吸几口烟，好在这一场战斗——夏收夏种已经基本结束了。
    和我共张床铺的老王同志，睡得香甜地发出鼾声。我借着煤油灯光，仔细地打量了一下，只见他黝黑的脸膛，闪闪发光，圆圆的脸蛋瘦削了许多，胡渣布满了下巴，头发长久没梳，像个鸡婆窝。他两臂漆黑，肩上脱了一层薄薄的皮屑，手膀上、背上、大腿上，被太阳蒸晒成钢黑色，你瞧，他睡得多香、多迷啊！
    勤勤恳恳将每个生产环节紧紧抓住，永远不知疲倦，身上像装了“发电机”似地，何止老王同志一人。这时无数往事涌上心头：曾有不断地教育和指导我，使我坚强更坚强的老上级；曾与我共同工作、学习、劳动过的战友；也有我亲眼看到的由一个农民，今天却变成一个坚强的农村干部；他们在公社化第一个早稻大丰收的日子里，付出了多大智慧和力量。今天丰收的硕果，也有他们的一份热和光……。
    今年早禾丰收，是多少种力量孕成的丰收果实呢？这是党的正确领导，人民公社制度无比优越性，农业八字宪法的胜利，无数的社员辛勤劳动，农村干部艰苦工作所得来的。这该有多少经验可以总结啊！
    我在心中暗暗地想：让那批不知名姓的、脚踏实地与社员共同生活共同劳动的所有基层干部，在抢收抢栽结束的夜里，好好地歇息吧！让他们睡得舒服、甜蜜，使他们有充沛的精力，迎接将到来的新的战斗任务。于是，我为了怕惊醒老王，只好蹑手蹑足爬到床边去睡。
                          （续完）
