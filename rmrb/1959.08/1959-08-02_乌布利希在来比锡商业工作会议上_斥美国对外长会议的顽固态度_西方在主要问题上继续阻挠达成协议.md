Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 1st - Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, condemned the United States' attitude at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference in a speech on July 31st.

    Ulbricht pointed out that US Vice President Nixon played a peace-loving role in the Soviet Union, but Herter in Geneva refused to establish normal conditions in West Berlin and West Germany. He said that if the US representatives believe that world peace must be guaranteed and all mankind must live in coexistence, then agreements should be reached in places where abnormal conditions still exist in the world—first of all in Germany—to eliminate these abnormal conditions.

    Ulbricht continued, West Berlin does not need American troops to safeguard world peace. The activities of American and other countries' espionage organizations in West Berlin are also not in the interests of safeguarding peace.

    Ulbricht refuted the fallacy that both East and West Berlin are engaged in espionage activities. He pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has not established a radio station in Washington. Why does the United States have the right to establish a radio station like "RIAS" in West Berlin that is hostile to the German Democratic Republic?

    Ulbricht refuted Herter's unreasonable demand that the four major powers supervise traffic to West Berlin on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, a demand directed against the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. He said that this demand has no legal basis, is not a topic for discussion at the Geneva Conference, and can only complicate the work of the conference.

    Ulbricht said that preparing a peace treaty with Germany is in the interest of world peace, and the people of the German Democratic Republic insist that a peace treaty with Germany must be prepared. We hope that the American representatives will more realistically reconsider the situation and help eliminate the abnormal situation in West Berlin.

    Ulbricht said that our proposal to establish an all-German committee composed of representatives of the two Germanys is entirely in line with the national interests of the German people. The Adenauer government viciously attacked this proposal, which means that as long as Adenauer, Strauss, and Schröder are in power in Bonn and carry out atomic armament, it will be impossible to unify Germany. While the Geneva Conference was in progress, they intensified atomic armament in West Germany and passed a decision to manufacture missiles in West Germany. Ulbricht said that West Germany's plan to solve the German question through civil war and war is doomed to failure.

    Ulbricht's speech was delivered at a business conference held in Leipzig.

    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 1st - TASS reported from Geneva: The Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—Gromyko, Herter, Lloyd, and Couve de Murville—held a meeting at the Soviet delegation's residence on the afternoon of July 31st. The issues from the previous days were further discussed at the meeting. On some issues, the positions of both sides were somewhat closer than in the past; however, on major issues, the Western countries still maintained their previous positions, obstructing the reaching of an agreement.

    乌布利希在来比锡商业工作会议上
    斥美国对外长会议的顽固态度
    西方在主要问题上继续阻挠达成协议
    新华社柏林1日电　德国统一社会党第一书记、德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希7月31日在一次演说中谴责美国在日内瓦外长会议上的态度。
    乌布利希指出，美国副总统尼克松在苏联扮演和平姿态，但是赫脱在日内瓦却拒绝在西柏林和西德建立正常状况。他说，如果美国的代表认为，必须保障世界和平，全世界人类必须在共处中生活，那么就应当在世界上还存在着不正常状态的地方——首先在德国——达成协议，以消除不正常状态。
    乌布利希接着说，为了保障世界和平，西柏林不需要美国军队。美国和其他国家的特务组织在西柏林活动，也是不符合于保障和平的利益的。
    乌布利希驳斥了所谓东、西柏林双方都有间谍活动的谬论。他指出，德意志民主共和国没有在华盛顿建立广播电台，为什么美国有权在西柏林建立“里亚斯”电台这种同德意志民主共和国为敌的电台呢。
    乌布利希驳斥了赫脱提出的由四大国在德意志民主共和国领土上监督通往西柏林的交通这种针对德意志民主共和国主权的不正当的要求。他说，这种要求没有合法的根据，不是日内瓦会议讨论的题目，它只能使会议的工作复杂化。
    乌布利希说，准备对德和约符合世界和平的利益，德意志民主共和国人坚持必须准备对德和约。我们希望美国的代表们将更现实地对形势重新考虑，并且帮助消除西柏林的不正常局势。
    乌布利希说，我们主张建立由两个德国的代表组成的全德委员会的建议，完全符合德国人民的民族利益。阿登纳政府恶毒攻击这一建议，这意味着：只要阿登纳、施特劳斯、施罗德还在波恩当权，并进行原子武装，就不可能统一德国。当日内瓦会议在进行的时候，他们在西德加紧了原子武装，并且通过了在西德制造导弹的决定。乌布利希说，西德想通过内战和战争解决德国问题的计划是注定要失败的。
    乌布利希的演说是在来比锡举行的商业工作会议上发表的。
    据新华社1日讯　塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联美国、英国和法国外交部长——葛罗米柯、赫脱、劳埃德和德姆维尔7月31日下午在苏联代表团寓所举行了会谈。在会谈中继续讨论了前几天的问题。在某些问题上，双方的立场像过去一样有所接近；但是，在主要问题上，西方国家仍然采取过去的立场，阻挠达成协议。
