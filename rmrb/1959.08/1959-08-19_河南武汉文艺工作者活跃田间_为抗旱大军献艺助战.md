Henan Wuhan Literary and Art Workers Active in the Fields
Presenting Performances to Aid the Fight Against Drought

    (Our Dispatch) Henan Province's mass cultural work is launching a large-scale, meticulous and in-depth propaganda campaign to actively encourage the vast masses' determination to fight drought and cheer for drought resistance to ensure a bumper harvest.
    Under the leadership of local party committees, the vast number of mass cultural activists are using propaganda forms such as blackboards, radio broadcasts, poems, clapper talks, storytelling, reading newspapers, big-character posters, and honor rolls to go deep into the fields, plots, wellsides, and canteens. They are extensively publicizing the great significance of fighting drought to ensure a bumper harvest, praising advanced figures and model deeds in the drought resistance struggle, encouraging the vigor and fighting spirit of the drought resistance army, and establishing the belief that man can conquer nature. This is powerfully promoting the in-depth development of the drought resistance and bumper harvest movement. For example, under the leadership of the party committee, each commune and brigade in Changge County organized a cultural propaganda army of more than 60,000 people to rush to the front lines of the drought resistance struggle, promptly discover advanced figures in drought resistance, commend them, and carry out appraisal competitions between individuals, groups, teams, and communes.
    The Baihe Commune in Mengjin County, led by the commune party secretary and propaganda committee members, organized a drought resistance and bumper harvest propaganda headquarters. Each brigade also assigned cadres specifically responsible for cultural propaganda work. The entire commune adopted the method of dividing responsibility areas and assigning responsibility to specific areas, conducting propaganda activities in canteens, fields, and members' homes. Now, all members of the commune vow, "If the drought is not eliminated, we will resolutely not withdraw!"
    The drought resistance headquarters of the Fangzhai Brigade of the Wulidian Commune in Mi County has also specifically set up a propaganda team. Competition red flags, blackboards, and active cultural propagandists can be seen everywhere in the fields. The captain even carried a megaphone with him when going to the fields, personally writing clapper talks and singing them. The Wugou Drought Resistance Commando had great energy, watering 7.5 mu of land in one day with twenty-six people. The propagandist immediately composed a song, and the next day the watering area increased by nearly two mu. The attendance rate of the entire brigade increased daily, and the effectiveness of watering doubled. People sang: "The scorching sun is like fire, the autumn seedlings are drooping due to drought, the people's commune has great strength, digging canals and wells with high enthusiasm, splitting the Nanshan Mountains with our hands, clear spring water flows into the fields, no matter if it rains or not, it can't stop the people's commune from having a great harvest." (Jin Bian)
    (Our Dispatch from Wuhan, August 18th) The Wuhan City Peking Opera Troupe, Han Opera Troupe, Chu Opera Troupe, and People's Art Theater and other units, jointly selected personnel to form three drought resistance performance teams, which went to state-owned farms and people's communes in the suburbs of Wuhan City to participate in the drought resistance struggle and conducted consolation performances. A team composed of the City Han Opera Troupe and Chu Opera Troupe immediately joined the heated drought resistance labor after arriving at the Dongxihu Vegetable Third Farm in the early morning. When everyone began to rest, the actors went to various places to perform for the drought resistance army. Hu Guilin, deputy head of the Han Opera Troupe, and Huang Chucai and Chen Huiqiu, actors from the Chu Opera Troupe, performed their best plays. The actors of the City Peking Opera Troupe repaired dams together with the masses in the Guanshan People's Commune in the morning. During the lunch break, they sang newly composed wonderful programs such as "Defeating the Drought Demon" regardless of fatigue. The Guangming Chu Opera Troupe went to Shiliupu in Hanyang to perform programs such as "The White Fan Story" and "Visiting Friends" for the drought resistance army. These activities were warmly welcomed and praised by the masses.
    Since the beginning of the drought resistance, many literary and art groups in Wuhan City have successively gone to the countryside, directly participating in the drought resistance struggle on the one hand, and carrying out performance activities during the masses' rest time on the other. They are both laborers and performers. In the past few months, many actors and staff members of major troupes such as Peking Opera, Han Opera, and Chu Opera have taken turns going to the countryside to carry out labor and performance activities. In addition to going to the suburbs of Wuhan City, they have also gone to many counties in Hubei Province to participate in labor and performances. The troupes went deep into the front lines of drought resistance to perform, further encouraging the enthusiasm of the vast masses, and the actors also received a great education. (Attached picture)

　　河南武汉文艺工作者活跃田间
　　为抗旱大军献艺助战
    本报讯　河南省的群众文化工作正在掀起一个大张旗鼓、细致深入的宣传运动，积极鼓舞广大群众的抗旱斗志，为抗旱保丰收而呐喊助战。
    广大的群众文化活动积极分子在各地党委的领导下，利用黑板报、广播、诗歌、快板、说唱、读报、大字报、光荣榜等宣传形式，深入田间、地头、井边、食堂，广泛地宣传抗旱保丰收的伟大意义，表扬抗旱斗争中的先进人物和模范事迹，鼓动抗旱大军的干劲和斗志，树立人定胜天的信念，有力地推动了抗旱保丰收运动的深入开展。如长葛县各公社、大队在党委的领导下，组织了一支六万余人的文化宣传大军，奔赴抗旱斗争的前沿，及时发现抗旱中的先进人物，加以表扬，并开展人与人、组与组、队与队、社与社之间的评比竞赛。
    孟津县白合公社以公社党委书记、宣传委员等为主组织了抗旱保丰收宣传指挥部，各大队也都抽出干部，专门负责文化宣传工作。全社采取划分责任区、分片包干的办法，深入食堂、田间和社员家中开展宣传活动。现在全社社员誓言“旱象不消灭，坚决不收兵！”
    密县五里店公社方砦大队抗旱指挥部里也专门设立了宣传组。田间地头到处可见竞赛的红旗、黑板报和活跃的文化宣传人员。队长下地还随身带上广播筒，亲自编写快板，又说又唱。五沟抗旱突击队干劲大，二十六人一天浇地七点五亩，宣传员马上编唱，第二天浇地又增加了近二亩。整个大队的出勤率日有提高，浇地的效力陡增一倍。人们唱道：“烈日当头似火烧，秋苗干旱低了头，人民公社力量大，挖渠打井干劲高，用手劈开南山岭，清清泉水田间流，任凭老天不下雨，挡不住人民公社大丰收。”（金边）
    本报武汉18日电　武汉市京剧团、汉剧团、楚剧团和人民艺术剧院等单位，联合抽调人员组成三个抗旱演出队，分别到武汉市郊区的国营农场和人民公社参加了抗旱斗争并进行了慰问演出。市汉剧团、楚剧团组成的一支队伍，清晨到达东西湖蔬菜三场后，立即投入了火热的抗旱劳动。当大家开始休息的时候，演员们分别到各处为抗旱大军表演。汉剧团副团长胡桂林、楚剧团演员黄楚材、陈惠秋等，都表演了自己的拿手好戏。市京剧团演员们在关山人民公社，上午和群众一道抢修水坝，中午休息时他们又不顾疲劳地演唱了新编的“战胜旱魔”等精彩节目。到汉阳十里铺的光明楚剧团，为抗旱大军表演了
  “白扇记”、“访友”等节目。他们的这些活动受到了群众的热烈欢迎和赞许。
    自抗旱开始以来，武汉市许多文艺团体曾先后纷纷下乡，一面直接参加抗旱斗争，一面利用群众休息的时间进行演出活动。他们既是劳动者，又是演出者。几个月来，京、汉、楚等主要剧团的许多演员和工作人员都轮流下乡进行过劳动和演出活动。他们除到过武汉市郊区外，还到过湖北不少的县份参加劳动和演出。各剧团深入到抗旱前线演出，进一步鼓舞了广大群众的干劲，演员们也受到了很大教育。（附图片）
