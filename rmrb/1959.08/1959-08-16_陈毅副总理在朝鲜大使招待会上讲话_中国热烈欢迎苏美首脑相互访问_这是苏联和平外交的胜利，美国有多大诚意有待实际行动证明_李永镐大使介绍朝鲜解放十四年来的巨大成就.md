Xinhua News Agency, August 15th – Vice Premier Chen Yi said today that it is universally acknowledged that the recently reached agreement on mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States is a major victory for Soviet peaceful diplomacy. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express a warm welcome to this measure, which is conducive to easing international tensions.

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks at a grand reception held tonight by the Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. Attending the reception were people from all walks of life in China and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: This year is also a year of vigorous development and greater strength for the entire socialist camp. The closer unity of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and their tremendous achievements in the economic, cultural, scientific, and technological fields have had a significant impact on current international life. At the same time, due to the efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to strive for peace and ease international tensions, and due to the growing sentiment of all peace-loving countries and people worldwide who favor peaceful coexistence and oppose the Cold War, an agreement on mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States has recently been reached. It is universally acknowledged that this is a major victory for Soviet peaceful diplomacy. The Chinese government and the Chinese people express a warm welcome to this measure, which is conducive to easing international tensions.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: However, we cannot fail to notice that while the United States has been forced to accept mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States, and has shown some conciliatory gestures, it still clings to its policies of aggression, expansion, and the Cold War. The United States not only has no intention of withdrawing its military bases abroad, but on the contrary, continues to expand and strengthen these bases. On the issues of signing a peace treaty with Germany, ending the occupation system in West Berlin, and banning nuclear weapons testing, it continues to adopt an extremely stubborn attitude, obstructing the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference from reaching an agreement on mature international issues. In the Far East, the United States continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, continues to赖在 [lai zai, to hang around] South Korea, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, and is further colluding with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government to intensify the revival of Japanese militarism. In Indochina, the United States is blatantly directing the Lao Sananikone government to expand the civil war they provoked, exacerbating tensions in the region. At the same time, the United States continues to slander and smear the socialist countries on a large scale. Even recently, when the U.S. Vice President visited the Soviet Union, the U.S. ruling clique staged a so-called "Captive Nations Week" farce at home. All these facts give people reason to maintain a vigilant attitude towards the conciliatory gestures expressed by the United States. How much sincerity the U.S. government has in this regard remains to be proven by future practical actions. But no matter what the subjective intentions of the United States are, in today's era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the practice of relying on war and the policy of strength is definitely becoming increasingly untenable. As long as the socialist forces, the national independence forces, and the peace forces of the world raise their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and continue their struggle, the imperialist policies of war and aggression can certainly be defeated.

These words of Vice Premier Chen Yi were warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign people attending the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, August 15th – Li Yong-ho, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel this evening to warmly celebrate the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the reception and delivered a speech. In his speech, he expressed the warmest congratulations to the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said: On the eve of their glorious national holiday, the Korean people have victoriously completed the first Five-Year Plan's industrial output value plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, and all sectors of the national economy have achieved tremendous development. This is a grand gift from the Korean people to their national holiday and an important milestone in the socialist construction of the Korean people. The unprecedented speed and grand scale of the development of Korean economic construction fully demonstrate the superiority and strong vitality of the socialist system. At the same time, this also proves the correctness of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean government's economic construction line, and embodies the Korean people's love for their motherland, love for socialism, and the resulting high labor enthusiasm and boundless creativity. The Chinese people cheer for the great victory of the fraternal Korean people in their construction cause and wish them continuous and greater achievements in their struggle to build socialism at an early date.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also said: The people of China and Korea have a fraternal and unbreakable friendship, and we are pleased to see that this friendship has had new developments in the past year. We thank the Korean people for their support to the Chinese people in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist occupation of our territory of Taiwan. Similarly, the Chinese people resolutely support the Korean people's struggle to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of their country. May the people of our two countries further support each other and cooperate closely in the struggle to build socialism and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. May the friendship between the people of our two countries be further consolidated and developed.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho spoke first at the beginning of the reception. He introduced to the Chinese and foreign guests the tremendous achievements of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in building socialism over the past ten years.

The Ambassador said: More than a decade ago, our country was still a backward and poor colonial and semi-feudal society. Today, it has become an industrial and agricultural country with a solid national self-reliant economic foundation. He said: The tremendous achievements made by the Korean people are the great fruits of the correct policies of the Korean Workers' Party, the brilliant fruits of the creative struggle of Korean workers, farmers, and intellectuals who support the Party's policies and are mobilized in unison, and the result of the active support of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries.

The Ambassador said: In contrast to the achievements made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, which was liberated on the same day and at the same time, has been turned into a dark and gloomy hell on earth by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, and the South Korean people have suffered unbearable pain and misfortune. Recently, in order to launch a new war, the U.S. imperialist executioners have again transported atomic weapons into South Korea, established missile bases, blatantly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, and blatantly carried out military provocations on the military demarcation line, constantly threatening the peace of our country.

The Ambassador pointed out: All the misfortunes and sufferings suffered by the South Korean people today are rooted in the forcible occupation of South Korea by the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops. The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops must immediately get out of South Korea, and the Korean issue must be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

In his speech, the Ambassador said: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made every effort to realize the desire of the suffering Korean residents in Japan, who are in unemployment and poverty, to return to their country, and has made all preparations to welcome them. Not long ago, thanks to our consistent efforts, the agreement between the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan on the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan was signed in Calcutta, India. This is a victory for the struggle of all the Korean people and a victory for humanitarianism. We look forward to the early return of Korean residents in Japan to the embrace of their motherland.

The Ambassador emphasized that U.S. imperialism still occupies the southern half of our country and China's Taiwan, which not only seriously threatens peace and security in the Far East, but also armed intervention in the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence and freedom, reviving German militarism, and frantically intensifying the tension in Europe. However, their "policy of strength" has long been completely bankrupt, and no struggle of imperialism can stop the advancing path of the people who yearn for peace and socialism. For the sake of peace in the Far East and the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Asia, and for lasting peace in the world, the Korean people will fight to the end together with the peace-loving people of the world.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho concluded by saying: The unity and solidarity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union is the reliable guarantee of all our victories. As is universally recognized, the people of Korea and China are comrades-in-arms and brothers linked by flesh and blood in the struggle against a common enemy. He congratulated the continued development and consolidation of Korean-Chinese friendship.

The speeches of Ambassador Li Yong-ho and Vice Premier Chen Yi drew round after round of warm applause from the audience. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of China and Korea respectively.

Attending this evening's reception were Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Liu Lantao, Vice Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee Li Siguang and Burhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association Li Dequan, heads of various departments of our national organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

    这是苏联和平外交的胜利，美国有多大诚意有待实际行动证明
    李永镐大使介绍朝鲜解放十四年来的巨大成就
    新华社15日讯　陈毅副总理今天说，举世公认，最近达成的苏美两国政府首脑相互访问的协议，是苏联和平外交的一次重大胜利。中国政府和中国人民对这一有助于缓和国际紧张局势的措施表示热烈欢迎。
    陈毅副总理是今晚在朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐举行的庆祝朝鲜解放十四周年的盛大招待会上讲这番话的。出席招待会的有中国各方面的人士和各国驻中国的使节。
    陈毅副总理说：今年这一年也是整个社会主义阵营的力量蓬勃发展和更加壮大的一年。以苏联为首的各兄弟国家的更加紧密的团结和它们在经济、文化、科学技术方面的巨大成就，对当前的国际生活产生了巨大的影响。同时，由于苏联和其他社会主义国家争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的努力，由于全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民赞成和平共处和反对冷战的情绪越来越高涨，最近达成了苏美两国政府首脑相互访问的协议。举世公认，这是苏联和平外交的一次重大胜利。中国政府和中国人民对这一有助于缓和国际紧张局势的措施表示热烈欢迎。
    陈毅副总理说：但是，我们也不能不注意到，美国在被迫接受苏美两国政府首脑互访，表现出某些缓和姿态的同时，却仍然死抱住它的侵略扩张政策和冷战政策不放。美国不仅无意撤退它在国外的军事基地，相反的还在继续扩大和加强这种基地。在签订对德和约、结束西柏林的占领制度、禁止核武器试验等问题上继续采取极端顽固的态度，阻挠日内瓦外长会议就成熟了的国际问题达成协议。在远东地区，美国还继续霸占着我国的领土台湾，继续赖在南朝鲜，阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并且进一步和日本岸信介政府相勾结，加紧复活日本的军国主义。在印度支那，美国正在明目张胆地指使老挝萨纳尼空政府扩大由他们挑起的内战，加剧这一地区的紧张局势。与此同时，美国仍然继续对各社会主义国家大肆进行诽谤和诬蔑。甚至就在最近美国副总统访问苏联的时候，美国统治集团还在国内排演了一场所谓“被奴役国家周”的丑剧。所有这些事实，使人们有理由对美国所表示的愿意和缓的姿态，保持警惕的态度。美国政府在这方面究竟具有多大诚意，还有待于今后实际行动的证明。但是不管美国的主观打算如何，在今天东风压倒西风的时代里，依靠战争和实力政策的做法肯定是越来越行不通了。只要全世界的社会主义力量，民族独立力量和和平力量，提高警惕，加强团结，再接再厉地进行斗争，帝国主义的战争和侵略政策是一定可以打败的。
    陈毅副总理的这些话受到了出席招待会的中外人士的热烈欢迎。
    新华社15日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐今晚在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝朝鲜解放十四周年。
    陈毅副总理出席招待会并讲了话。他在讲话中代表中国政府和中国人民，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民表示最热烈的祝贺。陈毅副总理在讲话中说：朝鲜人民在自己光荣的民族节日的前夕，胜利地提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划，国民经济各部门都获得了巨大发展。这是朝鲜人民向自己民族节日的盛大献礼，是朝鲜人民社会主义建设事业中的重要里程碑。朝鲜经济建设事业发展的这种空前速度和宏伟规模，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性和强大的生命力。同时，这也证明了朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府经济建设路线的正确，体现了朝鲜人民热爱祖国、热爱社会主义和由此而产生的高涨的劳动热情和无穷的创造力。中国人民欢呼兄弟的朝鲜人民在建设事业中的巨大胜利，并且预祝他们在争取早日建成社会主义的斗争中不断获得更大的成就。
    陈毅副总理又说：中、朝两国人民有着兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊，我们高兴地看到这种友谊，在最近一年中，又有了新的发展。我们感谢朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的斗争中给予我国人民的支持。同样，中国人民也坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美军撤出南朝鲜、和平统一祖国的斗争。愿我们两国人民在建设社会主义和维护远东和世界和平的斗争中，进一步地互相支持、紧密合作。愿我们两国人民的友谊进一步巩固和发展。
    李永镐大使在招待会开始时首先讲话。他向中外来宾介绍了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国十多年来建设社会主义的巨大成就。
    大使说：十几年前，我国还是一个落后、贫穷的殖民地半封建社会。今天，业已变成具有稳固的民族自立经济基础的工农业国。他说：朝鲜人民所取得的巨大的成就，是朝鲜劳动党正确政策的伟大果实，是拥护党的政策、一致动员起来的朝鲜工人、农民和知识分子创造性斗争的光辉果实，也是苏联、中国以及其它社会主义阵营各国人民积极支援的结果。
    大使说：与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所取得的成就相反，同一天同一时刻获得解放的南朝鲜，却被美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮变成了一座暗无天日的人间地狱，南朝鲜人民受尽了无法忍受的痛苦和不幸。最近一个时期，为了发动新战争，美帝国主义刽子手又把原子武器运入南朝鲜，建立导弹基地，粗暴地破坏朝鲜停战协定，在军事分界线上露骨地进行军事挑衅，一直威胁着我国的和平。
    大使指出：今天南朝鲜人民所遭受的一切不幸和痛苦，其祸根就在于美帝国主义侵略军队强占南朝鲜。美帝国主义侵略军队必须立即滚出南朝鲜，朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己解决。
    大使在讲话中说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了实现处在失业和贫困中的苦难的旅日侨胞的归国愿望做了一切努力，并且做好了迎接他们的一切准备。不久以前，由于我国的一贯努力，朝日红十字会关于旅日朝侨归国问题的协定业已在印度加尔各答签订。这是全体朝鲜人民的斗争胜利，是人道主义的胜利。我们期待着旅日朝鲜侨民早日回到祖国的怀抱里来。
    大使强调说：美帝国主义至今还霸占着我国的南半部和中国的台湾，不仅严重地威胁远东的和平和安全，而且还武装干涉亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立和自由的斗争，复活德国军国主义，疯狂地加剧欧洲的紧张局势。可是，他们的“实力政策”早已彻底破产了，帝国主义的任何挣扎，也阻挡不住一心向往和平和社会主义的人民的前进道路。为了远东和平和在亚洲建立无原子地区，为了世界持久和平，朝鲜人民将和全世界爱好和平人民一道斗争到底。
    李永镐大使最后说：以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的统一和团结，是我们一切胜利的可靠保证。像人们所公认的一样，朝中两国人民，在反对共同敌人的斗争中，是血肉相连的战友和兄弟。他祝贺朝中友谊继续发展和巩固。
    李永镐大使和陈毅副总理的讲话，博得了全场一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。在他们讲话以后，乐队分别奏了中朝两国国歌。
    出席今晚招待会的，有副委员长李济深，中共中央书记处候补书记刘澜涛，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，中朝友好协会会长李德全，我国国家机关各部门、各人民团体和各民主党派的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，以及各国驻华使节。
