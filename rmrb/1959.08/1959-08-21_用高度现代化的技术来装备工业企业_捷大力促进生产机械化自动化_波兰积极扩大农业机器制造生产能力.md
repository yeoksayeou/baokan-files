    Equipping industrial enterprises with highly modernized technology
    Czechoslovakia Vigorously Promotes Mechanization and Automation of Production
    Poland Actively Expands Agricultural Machine Manufacturing Capacity
    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Prague, August 20th) In recent years, with the rapid development of the national economy, Czechoslovakia has attached great importance to the mechanization and automation of production processes, and has achieved preliminary successes.
    At present, in the power industry sector, the combustion process of boilers in all thermal power plants has reached 57% automation, and the control of hydroelectric power plants has also reached 60% automation. In the metallurgical industry, 95% of blast furnaces are equipped with automatic adjustment devices for blast temperature. Since 1954, the production process of thirteen open-hearth furnaces has been automated.
    In the machine manufacturing industry, the development of automation and mechanization has been even more rapid. Last year alone, 220 new automated production lines were put into operation. Since 1954, more than 1,000 machine tools equipped with highly mechanized and automated operating devices have been put into production. They not only save a lot of manpower, but also increase labor productivity by 30% to 50%, becoming one of the important factors for the continuous improvement of machine production year after year. At the same time, due to the improvement of the technical level of the machine manufacturing industry, the machine manufacturing industry has also provided a large number of efficient machinery and equipment for many other industrial sectors.
    In addition, many production processes in the textile, shoe-making, and food industries have also been mechanized. For example, in the world-famous Svít Shoe Factory, the entire shoe production process is semi-mechanized and semi-automatic, and it can produce an average of 50 pairs of leather shoes per minute.
    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government have given great importance and attention to the automation and mechanization of production processes. At a recent meeting, the government focused on discussing the continued development and promotion of automation and mechanization, as well as the adoption of new technologies. It demanded that the enterprises currently under construction and expansion be equipped with highly modernized technologies, and that entire workshops, and even entire enterprises, be gradually equipped with comprehensive mechanized equipment.
    The 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia clearly stated that the key to improving labor productivity is complete mechanization, especially the automation of production processes. This task will be solved as a key issue in the development of the entire national economy in the third Five-Year Plan from 1961 to 1965. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has issued a call to all working people, economic workers and scientific workers, requiring them to pay attention to the rapid development of automation devices, instrumentation technology, and the entire electronics industry.
    (Dispatch from our newspaper in Warsaw, August 20th) Poland is vigorously carrying out agricultural mechanization in accordance with the policy formulated by the Second Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, and is regarding this work as one of the most important measures for future agricultural development.
    In order to greatly promote agricultural mechanization, Poland has decided to supply the countryside with 112,000 tractors, 100,000 traction machines, 95,000 reaper-binders, and 45,000 potato combines by 1965.
    In order to ensure the successful completion of the above-mentioned agricultural machinery supply task, Poland will expand the production capacity of agricultural machinery manufacturing enterprises, increase investment in existing enterprises, and greatly strengthen cooperation with socialist countries. Before 1965, Poland will use more than one billion zlotys (Polish currency) to expand tractor manufacturing plants. In addition, investment in the development of other agricultural machinery industries will increase to 700 million zlotys. At present, Poland's agricultural machinery manufacturing plants are manufacturing more than 150 kinds of agricultural machinery; by the end of this year, about 40 new types of agricultural machinery will be produced.
    At present, the main source of traction power in Polish agriculture is horses. In 1958, Poland had a total of 2.7 million horses; the fodder supplied to these horses amounted to 2.7 to 3 million tons per year, which is more than the annual grain needs of Poland's non-agricultural population. Therefore, Poland urgently needs to increase agricultural machinery to replace draft horses. By 1965, due to the increased supply of tractors and the reduction of horses, Poland will be able to free up 300,000 hectares of land for planting horse feed. This land will be used to raise approximately 200,000 cattle and 320,000 pigs to increase the production of livestock products such as meat and milk.

    用高度现代化的技术来装备工业企业
    捷大力促进生产机械化自动化
    波兰积极扩大农业机器制造生产能力
    本报布拉格20日电　近年来，随着国民经济的迅速发展，捷克斯洛伐克十分重视生产过程的机械化和自动化，并已获得了初步的成就。
    目前，在动力工业部门中，所有火电站的锅炉的燃烧过程已有57％达到自动化，水电站的控制也有60％自动化了。在冶金工业方面，95％的高炉都装有进风温度的自动调节装置，1954年以来，又有十三座平炉的生产过程已经自动化。
    在机器制造业方面，自动化和机械化的发展更为迅速，去年一年就有二百二十条新的自动化作业线投入生产。自1954年以来，有一千多台装备有高度机械化和自动操作装置的工作母机投入生产。它们不仅节省了大量人力，而且使劳动生产率提高了30％到50％，成为连年机器生产不断提高的重要因素之一。同时，由于机器制造业技术水平的提高，机器制造业也为许多其它工业部门提供了大量生产效率高的机器设备。
    此外，在纺织、制鞋和食品工业中也已有不少的生产过程做到了机械化。像世界闻名的光明鞋厂，整个鞋子的生产过程是半机械化和半自动化的，平均每分钟可以生产五十双皮鞋。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府对于生产过程的自动化和机械化问题给予了很大的重视和关心。政府在最近举行的一次会议上，着重讨论了继续发展和推广自动化和机械化以及采用新技术的问题，要求以高度现代化的技术装备目前正在新建和扩建的企业，要逐步以综合性的机械化设备装备整个车间，甚至整个企业。
    捷共第十一次代表大会曾明确提出：劳动生产率提高的关键是全盘机械化，特别是生产过程的自动化。这一任务将在1961—1965年第三个五年计划中，作为发展整个国民经济的关键问题来解决。捷共已向全体劳动人民，经济工作人员和科学工作者发出号召，要求他们注意自动化装置、仪表技术和整个电子工业的迅速发展。
    本报华沙20日电　波兰正在根据统一工人党二中全会拟定的方针，大力开展农业机械化，并且把这项工作作为今后农业发展的最重要的措施之一。
    为了大大推进农业机械化，波兰决定要在1965年以前，供应农村十一万二千台拖拉机、十万台牵引机、九万五千台割捆机、四万五千台马铃薯联合收割机。
    为了保证上述农业机器供应任务能胜利完成，波兰将扩大农业机器制造企业的生产能力，增加对现有企业的投资，同时大大加强同社会主义国家的合作。1965年前，波兰将用十亿多兹罗提（波币）来扩建拖拉机制造厂。此外，发展其他农业机器工业的投资将增加到七亿兹罗提。目前，波兰的农业机器制造厂正在制造一百五十种以上的农业机器；到今年年底，还要生产约四十种新农业机器。
    波兰目前农业中的牵引力主要是马匹。1958年，波兰共有二百七十万匹马；供应这些马匹的饲料每年达二百七十到三百万吨，这比波兰非农业人口每年粮食的需要量还多。因此，波兰急需增加农业机器来代替耕马。到1965年，由于增加拖拉机的供应和减少马匹，波兰将可以腾出三十万公顷种植马饲料的土地。这些土地将用于饲养约二十万头牛和三十二万只猪，以增加肉类、牛奶等畜产品的生产。
