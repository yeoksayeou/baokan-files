    A Peace Appeal from Hiroshima
    By Our Staff Commentator

    The Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, held in Hiroshima, Japan, which had suffered the tragic disaster of the atomic bomb, successfully closed on August 7th. Over the past few days, seventy-three delegates from twenty-four countries and nine international organizations, along with ten thousand Japanese representatives, gathered in Hiroshima to discuss the major issue of safeguarding human peace and happiness. In the appeal and proposals adopted by the conference, it was pointed out that nuclear war should now be prohibited and should be considered illegal. The conference advocated the elimination of all military blocs, the establishment of nuclear-free zones in all regions of the world, and the prohibition of arming West Germany and Japan. It also suggested that all peace fighters demand a summit meeting of great powers to discuss issues such as the permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons. This peace appeal issued by the conference reflects the most ardent wishes of the Japanese people and the people of the world and will undoubtedly receive their warm response.

    Currently, among the countries possessing nuclear weapons, only the Soviet Union is resolutely making unremitting efforts to prohibit nuclear weapons and to promote peaceful coexistence among all countries. The Western countries, especially the United States, are still clinging to the bankrupt "position of strength" policy, intensifying the nuclear arms race, actively plotting to establish military bases for nuclear warfare on foreign territories, and hindering the genuine relaxation of international tensions. It is precisely because of the obstruction of the United States and other Western countries that the Geneva international conference on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, although it has been going on for a year, has still not reached an agreement on substantive issues. Soviet Premier Khrushchev correctly pointed out in his congratulatory message to the Hiroshima World Conference: "The most pressing task at present is to save humanity from the threat of nuclear war. The Soviet delegation at the Geneva Conference is now insisting on an immediate cessation of nuclear weapon tests, which should become an important step towards the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and the destruction of these weapons from the armaments of all countries."

    The Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was subjected to numerous obstructions and sabotage by the Japanese reactionaries. The Kishi Nobusuke government put pressure on the Japanese people's atomic and hydrogen bomb movement, attempting to force the World Conference to cancel the discussion on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." During the conference, Japanese fascists engaged in disturbances and sabotage everywhere in Hiroshima, even committing acts of violence with knives, stabbing Japanese representatives participating in the conference. However, the Hiroshima World Conference, regardless of the oppression and sabotage by the Japanese reactionaries, still discussed the issue of revising the "Security Treaty" and adopted a "Message to the Japanese People," calling on the Japanese people to oppose the militarization and nuclear armament of Japan and to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." This is a great victory for the Japanese people. This fact fully demonstrates that the firm will of the Japanese people to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance and nuclear armament cannot be stifled by any reactionary force. On August 6th, more than one million people across Japan launched the fifth unified action to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese people have scheduled the sixth unified action, which will be larger in scale and more powerful than the previous ones, to be launched on September 7th.

    The Kishi Nobusuke government's pursuit of the U.S. war policy and open hostility to the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs can only arouse greater anger among the Japanese people and promote a new upsurge in the Japanese people's movement.

    从广岛发出的和平号召
    本报评论员
    在日本广岛地方举行的第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，已在8月7日胜利地闭幕了。这几天来，二十四个国家和九个国际组织的七十三位代表同日本代表一万人云集在广岛这个曾经是受过原子弹惨痛灾害的地方，对维护人类和平与幸福的重大问题进行了讨论。大会在它所通过的呼吁书和建议书中指出，现在，核战争应该禁止，并应该认为是非法的。大会主张消灭一切军事集团，在世界各地区建立无原子区，禁止武装西德和日本，并建议所有和平战士要求召开大国首脑会议，就永远禁止核武器等问题进行协商。大会发出的这个和平号召反映了日本人民和全世界人民当前最殷切的愿望，无疑将会得到他们热烈的响应。
    现在在拥有核武器的国家中，只有苏联坚决地为禁止核武器和世界各国人民和平共处而进行着不懈的努力。而西方国家，特别是美国仍然死抱住已经破产的“实力地位”政策，加紧核武器竞赛，积极图谋在外国领土上建立核子战争的军事基地，阻挠国际紧张局势的真正的缓和。正是由于美国等西方国家的阻挠，所以日内瓦关于不继续试验核武器的国际会议虽然已经进行了一年，但仍未在实质问题上达成协议。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在致广岛世界大会的贺信中正确地指出：“当前最迫切的任务是拯救人类免于核战争的威胁。现在苏联代表团在日内瓦会议上坚持立即停止核武器试验，这应该成为完全禁止核武器和从各国军备中销毁这些武器的一个重要步骤”。
    第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会曾经遭到日本反动派的重重阻挠和破坏。岸信介政府对日本人民原子弹氢弹运动施加压力，企图迫使世界大会取消关于修改日美“安全条约”的讨论。在会议期间，日本法西斯分子在广岛到处进行捣乱和破坏，甚至持刀行凶，刺伤参加大会的日本代表。但是，广岛世界大会不顾日本反动派的压迫和破坏，对修改“安全条约”问题还是进行了讨论，并且通过了“告日本人民书”，号召日本人民反对日本军国主义化和核武装，阻止修改日美“安全条约”。这是日本人民的大胜利。这个事实充分表明，日本人民反对美日军事同盟和核武装的坚定意志是任何反动势力都扼杀不了的。8月6日，日本各地一百多万人展开了阻止修改日美“安全条约”的第五次统一行动。日本人民已经预定在9月7日掀起比以前几次规模更大、气势更壮的第六次统一行动。
    岸信介政府追随美国战争政策，公开敌视禁止原子弹氢弹运动，只能激起日本人民更大的愤怒，促使日本的人民运动走向新的高涨。
