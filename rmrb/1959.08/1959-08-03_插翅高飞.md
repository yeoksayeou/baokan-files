    Taking Wing
    Zou Shengquan

    Birds are the most accomplished aviators in nature. They can freely flap their powerful wings, effortlessly perform various acrobatic maneuvers, accurately judge direction and altitude, and soar up and down.

    The flight of any aircraft must have lift and drag (or thrust), and the same is true for the flight of birds. The thrust of an aircraft is provided by the engine, while the source of lift is due to the asymmetry of the upper and lower surfaces of the wing. When relative airflow passes over the upper and lower surfaces, an upward lifting force is generated, lifting the aircraft into the air. If the wing and the oncoming airflow are at an angle, the direction of this force changes. The component of force in the vertical direction is called lift, and the component in the horizontal direction is called drag. Similarly, a bird's wing is similar to an aircraft wing, with a convex upper surface and a flat or concave lower surface, so it can also generate lift, and it changes with the different postures of the wings. The difference between a bird's wing and an aircraft wing is that a bird's wing can also generate thrust. To generate thrust, the bird flaps its wings up and down. The true movement of the bird's wing is a combination of up-and-down flapping and forward movement.

    In addition, birds are good at finding updrafts. At this time, their wings do not need to flap to rise or maintain their original height for soaring flight. Sometimes, birds can also spread their wings like gliders and glide downwards along a diagonal line.

    The principle of bird flight is not complicated, so can humans create a wing that uses the reaction force of up and down flapping to fly like a bird? It is said that during the Wang Mang era, someone tied feathers to their body as wings and flew hundreds of steps. Foreigners have also done similar experiments, but none have been successful. Since the invention of the first airplane, airplanes have been developing in another direction, with all wings remaining stationary. At present, aircraft and other flying machines based on the physiological structure and flight methods of birds have been developed very well, and their speed, altitude, and range are incomparable to those of birds. However, there is one thing that is still inferior to birds. That is, the thrust of an airplane is only 6% to 20% of the weight of the airplane. Birds can reach several times their own weight. It can be seen that flapping wings still have their advantages. Therefore, it has once again attracted people's attention. It is very realistic to study ornithopters based on modern highly developed aviation technology.

    The world's first flapping-wing glider was made in the Soviet Union, and its name is "Oleg Kosevo." Since 1948, the Soviet Union has been conducting this research and has made various types of this flapping-wing aircraft or model. Some are like birds, some are like insects, some are single-seat, double-seat or multi-seat, some have high horsepower and some have low horsepower. There are flapping-wing flying men or air motorcycles.

    Experiments have proved that flapping-wing aircraft have a light and strong structure, low take-off and landing speeds, do not require special airports or long runways, and have several times the lift of ordinary aircraft. Their economy, reliability, and safety are superior to those of ordinary aircraft. At present, flapping-wing aircraft are still in the experimental stage. The main problems are to manufacture engines with extremely high horsepower and light weight and to solve the aerodynamic problems of flapping-wing flight. Human ideals are endless, and the era of taking wing is not far away.

    插翅高飞
    邹盛铨
    鸟类是自然界最优秀的飞行家，它们能自如地扑动着有力的翅膀，随意做着各种特技动作，准确地判断着方向和高低，上下盘旋。
    任何飞行器的飞行都必须要有升力和拉力（或推力），鸟的飞行也同样如此。飞机的拉力是由发动机供给的，而升力的来源，则是由于机翼上下表面不对称，相对气流流过上下表面时，就产生一个向上的举力，把飞机举在空中。如果机翼和迎面气流偏斜一个角度，这种力的方向也就发生改变，这时在铝垂方向的分力叫升力，水平方向的分力叫阻力。同样，鸟的翅膀也和飞机类似，上表面凸出，下表面凹平，因而也能产生升力，并且随着翅膀的姿态不同而改变。鸟翅和机翼不同的地方在于鸟翅还能够产生拉力。为了产生拉力，鸟上下挥动着翅膀，鸟翅的真实运动是上下挥动和前进运动的合成。
    此外，鸟还善于找寻上升气流，这时候，它的翅膀不扑动也能上升或维持原来的高度而作翱翔飞行。有时候，鸟也能张开翅膀像滑翔机一样沿着斜线，向下滑翔。
    鸟类飞行的原理既不复杂，那么人能不能造出一种翅膀，像鸟那样利用上下扑动的反作用力来飞行呢？据说王莽时代，曾经有人把羽毛绑在身上当双翼，飞行了几百步。外国也有人作过类似的试验，但是都没有得到成功。自从第一架飞机发明以来，飞机一直沿着另一个方向发展，所有的机翼都是不动的。目前，以鸟类的生理结构和飞行方法作为基础的飞机等飞行器，已经发展得十分完善了，不论速度高度和航程都是鸟不可比拟的。然而只有一点，却还不如鸟儿。那就是飞机推力只及飞机重量的6％到20％。鸟儿却可以达自身重量的几倍。可见扑翼还是有它的优越性的。因此它又重新引起了人们的重视。在现代高度发展的航空技术基础上来研究扑翼机，就具有很大的现实性了。
    世界上第一架扑翼滑翔机，是苏联制成的，它的名字叫“奥立格·柯歇伏”。苏联自从1948年开始这项研究以来，已经作成了各种型式的这种扑翼机或模型。它们有的像飞鸟，有的如昆虫、有单座双座或多座，有大马力也有小马力的。有扑翼式的飞人或空中摩托。
    试验证明，扑翼机结构轻便牢固，起飞着陆速度小，不需专用机场或长跑道，升力比普通飞机大几倍，经济性、可靠安全性等都是普通飞机所不及的。目前扑翼机还处在试验阶段，主要的问题是要制造马力特大、重量较轻的发动机和解决扑翼飞行的空气动力方面的问题。人类的理想是无止境的，插翅高飞的时代已为期不远了。
