Slander Cannot Change the Facts
*People's Daily* Commentator

A farce of slander against socialist countries, starring the US President, has been staged in the United States. First, the US Senate and House of Representatives passed a joint resolution authorizing the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July each year as the so-called "Captive Nations Week." Then, Eisenhower went to church to pray for the "pain and suffering" of the people of the socialist countries who have been completely liberated. US congressmen also took to the streets to hold ceremonies for the so-called "Captive Nations Week." However, it seems that the stage effect of this play was not good, and the audience was sparse and scattered. The "masses" participating in the New York street ceremony, including the officials, numbered only about a hundred people. Even many American bourgeois newspapers are not interested in this call from the US government; they consider it an untimely and foolish action, and some newspapers simply do not mention the joint resolution of Congress. Abroad, this provocative behavior of the US government has been strongly condemned by the people of socialist countries. Nevertheless, this farce continues to be performed. On July 29, Eisenhower continued to attack socialist countries at a press conference. On July 30, Eisenhower announced that October 7 would be designated as "National Day of Prayer," asking Americans to join him in "deep concern" for those who are "now suffering physical, mental and spiritual pain."

Why is the US ruling clique so hysterically slandering and attacking socialist countries? Of course, imperialists have always been hostile to socialist countries. They always call the completely liberated people "enslaved" and the people under their enslavement "independent and free." But the question is, why did they launch this slander campaign at this particular time? It is not difficult to see that the growing strength of the socialist camp, their internal unity as solid as a rock, their overwhelming advantage in the peaceful competition between the two systems, their free and happy lives, and their thriving atmosphere are having an increasing impact on the people living under the yoke of the capitalist system. At the same time, as the trend of peaceful coexistence has become the mainstream of the world, friendly exchanges between the people of all countries are constantly increasing, and the pressure to improve relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is also increasing. Those "cold war" advocates who make a living by "transporting ice" cannot but become more alarmed. In order to deceive and confuse the people of all countries, to resist the influence of socialism, to obstruct the trend of international detente, and to undermine the friendship between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union, they have once again resorted to the weapon of slander.

However, this slander campaign first exposed the US ruling clique itself. Didn't Eisenhower and Nixon say many good things about "peace"? Now let us see what their so-called "peace" really is! The US Congress's "joint resolution" calls socialist countries "captive nations" and openly shouts that the United States should use "appropriate and official means" to support these countries in "restoring their freedom and independence." It also lists China's Tibet and many republics of the Soviet Union as "captive nations," maliciously obliterating the sacred sovereignty of China and the Soviet Union over their own territories. Eisenhower also said that only when these countries restore "freedom" will "world peace be guaranteed." So that's it! The "peace" that the US ruling clique talks about is the delusion of restoring the enslavement of the already liberated people, of provoking relations between socialist countries, of interfering in the internal affairs of socialist countries, and of conducting endless "cold war," threats, and subversion against socialist countries!

It is also no coincidence that the US ruling clique launched a campaign to slander socialist countries during Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union and the opening of the American Exhibition in the Soviet Union. While slandering socialist countries, they are also loudly promoting the American way of life, and their intention is very obvious. That is, they vainly attempt to peddle capitalist goods to the people of socialist countries. The US Congress's "joint resolution" says that the United States is a "bastion of human freedom," that the United States has "harmonious national unity" at home, and that abroad, it "has a strong sympathy for the aspirations of people everywhere." In his speech in the Soviet Union, Nixon described the United States as the most "happy" place and said that the United States "has not asked for or received an acre of land from the people of any other country." It is hard to imagine how these American masters can have such great courage in lying! What kind of "bastion of human freedom" is the United States? People all over the world have seen with their own eyes that the few millionaires there have the "freedom" to act arbitrarily and spend money like water, while the vast working people only have the "freedom" to be exploited, enslaved, and unemployed. The US ruling class openly promotes racism, practices racial discrimination, and eighteen million black people suffer appalling persecution, without even the guarantee of life. What is this called "harmonious national unity"! The US imperialists carry out aggression, plunder, and oppression all over the world. It occupies China's Taiwan, occupies the southern part of Korea and Vietnam, occupies hundreds of military bases in dozens of countries, occupies tens of thousands of hectares of oil fields, mines, and plantations in Asian, African, and Latin American countries... Is this called not wanting an acre of land from others? And when the Chinese people demand that the American aggressors withdraw from Taiwan, when the Korean and Vietnamese people demand the peaceful reunification of their motherland, when the people of many countries shout "Yankee go home," when the Asian, African, and Latin American countries demand the recovery of their sovereignty from the American colonialists, and when the Cuban people resolutely implement land reform and demand the recovery of the land occupied by the United States, how has this US imperialism, which "has a strong sympathy for the aspirations of people everywhere," demonstrated its "leadership"? That is to carry out crazy threats, interference, subversion, and even armed aggression against these countries. The reason why the independence and freedom of the people of many countries have been damaged or completely lost is none other than the existence of the United States, a "bastion of freedom." The United States is the largest enslaver in the world, while the Soviet Union and socialist countries are friends of all oppressed people. This is a fact personally felt by millions of people. The United States cannot change this fact even if it holds fifty-two "Captive Nations Weeks" every year, but will only try to cover it up.

Lincoln said a sentence: You can deceive a few people for a long time, you can also deceive most people temporarily, but you can not deceive most people for a long time. The tragedy of the American imperialist slanderers lies here. More and more people in various countries around the world, including the vast number of American people, have been able to see through the hypocritical propaganda and conspiracies of the American imperialists, and are able to understand the free and happy lives of the people of socialist countries and their sincere desire to coexist peacefully and cooperate friendly with the people of all countries. Whether the US "cold war" advocates and slanderers pray, curse, or threaten, the tide of world peace will become more turbulent, and the sun of socialism will shine more brilliantly. All this will bring greater frustration and fear to the "cold war" advocates, and bring infinite encouragement and hope to all people who love peace and freedom.

    诽谤改变不了事实
    本报评论员
    一出以美国总统为主角的诽谤社会主义国家的丑剧，已经在美国上演。首先，美国参众两院通过一项联合决议，授权总统颁布公告，规定每年7月的第三个星期为所谓“被奴役国家周”。接着，艾森豪威尔走进教堂，为那些彻底解放了的社会主义各国人民的“痛苦和苦难”作了祈祷。美国议员们也走上街头，为所谓“被奴役国家周”举行了仪式。可是，看来这出戏的舞台效果并不好，观众冷冷清清，七零八落。参加纽约街头仪式的“群众”，连官员们算在内，不过百人。甚至美国许多资产阶级报纸对于美国政府这个号召也不感兴趣，它们认为这是不合时宜的愚蠢的行动，有的报纸对于国会的联合决议干脆只字不提。而在国外，美国政府的这种挑衅的行为，更是遭到社会主义各国人民的强烈谴责。尽管如此，这出丑剧还是继续表演下去。7月29日，艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上继续攻击社会主义国家。7月30日，艾森豪威尔又宣布把10月7日规定为“全国祈祷日”，要求美国人跟着他“深切关怀”所谓“现在忍受肉体、思想和精神上的痛苦的人”。
    美国统治集团如此歇斯底里地大肆诬蔑和攻击社会主义国家，这究竟是为什么呢？当然，帝国主义者从来就是敌视和仇视社会主义国家的，它们总是把彻底解放了的人民叫做“被奴役”的，而把处于它们奴役之下的人民叫做“独立自由”的。但是，问题在于，它们为什么偏偏在这个时候发动这个诽谤运动呢？不难看出，社会主义阵营各国的日益强大，它们的内部团结坚如磐石，它们在两种制度和平竞赛中的压倒优势，它们的自由幸福生活和欣欣向荣的气象，对于处在资本主义制度奴役下的人民，正在发生着越来越大的影响。同时，由于和平共处的潮流已经成为世界的主流，各国人民之间的友好往来正在不断增进，而要求改善美苏两国关系的压力也在日益增强，那些以“运冰”为业的“冷战”鼓吹者们不能不更加惊慌起来了。为了欺骗和迷惑各国人民，以抵制社会主义的影响，为了阻挡国际局势的趋向缓和，破坏美苏两国人民的友谊，他们又一次乞灵于诽谤的武器。
    然而，这个诽谤运动首先倒是揭穿了美国统治集团自己。艾森豪威尔和尼克松不是讲了许多关于“和平”的好话吗？现在请看他们的所谓“和平”究竟是什么吧！美国国会的“联合决议”把社会主义国家叫做“被奴役国家”，公然叫喊美国要用“适当和官方的办法”来支持这些国家“恢复他们的自由和独立”。它并且把中国领土西藏和苏联的许多加盟共和国也列为“被奴役国家”，恶意抹煞中苏两国对于自己领土的神圣主权。艾森豪威尔还说，只有这些国家恢复“自由”，“世界和平才有保障”。原来如此！美国统治集团所说的“和平”，就是妄想恢复对于已经解放了的人民的奴役，就是挑拨社会主义各国的关系，就是干涉社会主义各国的内政，就是对社会主义各国进行无休止的“冷战”、威胁和颠覆！
    美国统治集团发动诽谤社会主义国家的运动，恰恰是在尼克松访苏和美国展览会在苏联开幕的期间，这也不是巧合。他们在诬蔑社会主义国家的同时，正大吹大擂地宣扬美国生活方式，其用心是很明显的。那就是妄想向社会主义国家的人民兜售资本主义的货色。美国国会的“联合决议”说美国是“人类自由堡垒”，美国在国内有着“和谐的民族团结”；在国外，它又
  “对各地人民的愿望抱有强烈的同情”。尼克松在苏联的演说中则把美国描写成为最“幸福”的地方，并且说美国“没有向任何其他国家人民要求过或者从他们那里得到过一亩土地”。人们很难想像，这些美国老爷们在说谎方面怎么会有这么大的勇气！美国是怎样一个“人类自由堡垒”呢？全世界人民有目共睹：那里的少数百万富翁有作威作福、挥金如土的“自由”，而广大劳动人民却只有受剥削、受奴役和失业的“自由”。美国统治阶级公开宣扬种族主义，实行种族歧视，一千八百万黑人遭受骇人听闻的迫害，甚至连生命的保障都没有。这叫什么“和谐的民族团结”！美帝国主义者在全世界到处进行侵略、掠夺和压迫。它霸占了中国的台湾，霸占了朝鲜和越南的南部，霸占了几十个国家的几百个军事基地，霸占了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的多少万公顷的油田、矿山和种植园……难道这叫做没有要过别人的一亩土地吗？而当中国人民要求美国侵略者从台湾撤走的时候，当朝鲜和越南人民要求实现祖国和平统一的时候，当许多国家的人民高喊“美国佬滚回去”的时候，当亚非和拉丁美洲国家要求从美国殖民主义者那里收回自己主权的时候，当古巴人民坚决实行土地改革要求收回美国霸占的土地的时候，这个“对各地人民的愿望抱有强烈的同情”的美帝国主义是怎么表现了它的“领导作用”呢？那就是对这些国家进行疯狂的威胁、干涉、颠覆直到武装侵略。世界上有许多国家人民的独立自由所以受到损害，或者丧失殆尽，不是因为别的，就是因为有了美国这样一个“自由堡垒”。美国是世界上最大的奴役者，而苏联和社会主义各国则是一切受压迫人民的朋友。这是千百万人民所亲身感受的事实。美国就是每年举行五十二个“被奴役国家周”也改变不了这个事实，而只会欲盖弥彰。
    林肯说过一句话，你可以长期欺骗少数人，你也可以暂时欺骗多数人，但你不能长期欺骗多数人。美帝国主义诽谤者的悲哀正在这里。越来越多的包括美国广大人民在内的世界各国人民，已经能够识破美帝国主义者的虚伪宣传和阴谋诡计，并且能够了解社会主义各国人民的自由幸福生活以及他们要求同世界各国人民和平共处、友好合作的真诚愿望。不论美国的“冷战”鼓吹者和诽谤者祈祷也好，诅咒也好，威胁也好，世界和平的潮流将要更加汹涌澎湃，社会主义的太阳将要放出更加灿烂的光芒。这一切将给“冷战”鼓吹者带来更大的沮丧和恐惧，而给一切爱好和平和自由的人民带来无限的鼓舞和希望。
