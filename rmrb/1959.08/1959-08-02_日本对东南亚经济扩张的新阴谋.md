    Japan's New Conspiracy of Economic Expansion in Southeast Asia
    Zhang Tingzheng
    Today, as Japan and the United States are stepping up their efforts to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and establish a new "Japan-U.S. military alliance," Japanese monopoly capital is eagerly trying to use further military allegiance to the United States as a price to gain U.S. support and accelerate its expansion into Southeast Asia.
    Recently, Japan's new conspiracy for economic expansion in Southeast Asia is to cooperate with the United States' strategic requirements for creating tension in the Far East, formulate long-term and comprehensive economic expansion plans, and attempt to occupy major markets first in order to cope with the fierce competition of imperialist countries in the Southeast Asian market.
          Seizing Every Opportunity
    On April 4 this year, Eisenhower delivered a speech, talking a lot about the importance of Japan in anti-communism in Asia, and encouraging Japan to develop towards Southeast Asia. The Nobusuke Kishi group in Japan immediately thought there was an opportunity and asked the United States to help them and not hinder them from resolving the compensation issue with South Vietnam. This "compensation agreement," which violated the Geneva Accords, was finally signed on May 13 with the tacit approval of the United States. At the same time, Japan took advantage of the United States' attempt to win over nationalist countries and their economic difficulties, and increased its loan to India by $10 million, bringing the total of the two previous credit lines to $70 million. In addition, it also requested Japan-U.S. cooperation to "develop" India's Bailadila iron ore mine. However, Japan's main target for expansion this year is Indonesia. According to Japan's "Jiji Press," the Japanese government has decided to focus on Indonesia as an "expansion priority" because Indonesia is rich in resources, has a large population, and is a "combination point" between the socialist camp and the "liberal forces," and a "combination point" between the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and the "Northeast Asia Group." Therefore, "the United States seems to be using Japanese technology" to provide "economic assistance" to Indonesia. At the same time, Japan also attempts to form a "broad market" in Southeast Asia with Indonesia as the center.
    Since the beginning of this year, Japan has truly been "attacking in full force" against Indonesia. Its characteristic is to use all means to obtain the assistance of American capital. For example, Japan suggested using the U.S. "Development Loan Fund" to jointly "invest in the construction" of the Asahan River dam in North Sumatra. This plan was designed by Kudo Hiroki of the Japanese industrial company during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in World War II. Japan also requested that all 100,000 bales of surplus cotton shipped by the United States to Indonesia be processed by Japan, and the processing fee be deducted from the compensation. Japan's Maruzen Oil Company and the U.S. Union Oil Company will soon jointly form a new oil company to cooperate in "developing" oil resources in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The Japanese government also proposed to lend $25 million to Indonesia with compensation as collateral, of which $20 million would be used to purchase complete sets of equipment, and the remaining $3 million and $2 million would be used to purchase Japanese textiles and ceramics that lacked sales channels, respectively. In addition, Japan's first-year war reparations to Indonesia amounted to $32 million. In addition to using nine ships worth $7.2 million (the price of old ships was even higher than the price of new ships), the remaining funds were planned to be used to promote complete sets of equipment and light industrial products. It can be seen that Japan's new conspiracy to expand into Indonesia is based on Japan-U.S. cooperation and supported by war reparations, attempting to plunder resources, occupy markets, and influence Indonesia's foreign policy in order to realize the political conspiracy of Japan and the United States. Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama said in the "Tokyo Shimbun" on January 4 this year that "the economy of Southeast Asia is politics," which frankly revealed the essence of Japan's "economic cooperation."
    The So-Called "New Economic Diplomacy"
    When formulating this year's foreign expansion plan, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs put forward the so-called "new economic diplomacy" policy. It stipulates that in order to ensure the future development and expansion of the Japanese economy, Southeast Asia should be cultivated as a target, and a trade policy combining "compensation" and economic "assistance" should be adopted. Nobusuke Kishi ordered the cabinet on the cabinet meeting on June 6 to formulate a "system for long-term economic cooperation with the entire Southeast Asian region." Calculated based on the various economic agreements that Japan and Southeast Asian countries have already signed or decided to sign, the estimated amount of funds available for expenditure in 20 years is approximately $1.9 billion. Among them, compensation to Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Vietnam amounts to $1.0012 billion, and the "economic cooperation" agreements signed with the compensation agreements amount to $742 million. In addition, there are loans to India and other countries. This is the basis for Japan's proposed "new economic diplomacy" and the formulation of a long-term comprehensive expansion plan. The central content of the long-term expansion plan is "agricultural Southeast Asia, industrial Japan," the purpose of which is to use Southeast Asia as a market for dumping Japanese light and heavy industrial products and as a source for plundering raw materials.
    Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama revealed the contents of this long-term expansion plan when he convened a meeting of embassy and consular personnel stationed in Asia and the Pacific in March this year. He said that Japan's "Asian diplomacy has ended the post-war handling stage and has now entered a period of launching a new active diplomacy." The "development" of economically underdeveloped countries in Asia mainly includes "developing" natural resources, cultivating small and medium-sized enterprises, and establishing "technical centers."
    It is a well-known fact that Japan uses Southeast Asia as a base for supplying raw materials. In recent years, Japan has imported approximately 8 million tons of iron ore annually, 80% of which comes from Southeast Asia, and Malaysia supplies approximately one-third of Japan's iron ore consumption. In March this year, the Japanese steel delegation went to India to request Japan-U.S.-India cooperation to develop the Bailadila iron ore mine in addition to the Rourkela iron ore mine, and it is estimated that in fiscal year 1966, Japan can import 8 million tons of iron ore from India annually (4 million tons from Bailadila, 2 million tons from Rourkela, and 2 million tons from the Indian Trading Corporation). In addition, Japan also plans to mine iron ore, oil, and antimony ore in Burma, and get involved in iron ore and copper ore in the Philippines, tin ore in Thailand, and so on. Currently, Japan has 15 mining areas under development.
    In order to prevent Southeast Asian countries from developing their national economies and achieving true independence, Japan has been trying its best to spread the fallacy that economically underdeveloped countries should not establish heavy industries. Japanese bourgeois newspapers and broadcasters believe that the shortage of foreign exchange and economic difficulties in Southeast Asia are not the result of unequal exchange, but the result of errors in carrying out basic construction. In the future, they should follow the example of Japan's early Meiji Restoration, first run small and medium-sized enterprises, develop agriculture and forestry, and there is no need to demand compensation in the form of means of production. Recently, various Japanese delegations that visited Southeast Asia have unanimously advocated that Japan should cooperate with Southeast Asia in small and medium-sized enterprises.
    Most noteworthy is that, in order to intensify the tense situation in the Far East, Japanese and U.S. monopoly capital is attempting to provoke wars and create internal disturbances in Southeast Asia, and is preparing for Japan to manufacture large quantities of weapons and military supplies to supply to Southeast Asian countries, so that Japan can become the United States' arsenal in the Far East. Recently, the United States ordered 5,312 military trucks from Japan for Southeast Asia in one fell swoop, plus other accessory orders totaling $6.83 billion. The "compensation agreement" signed between Japan and the Ngo Dinh Diem group in South Vietnam is mainly used to build hydropower stations to strengthen military bases and supply facilities for the U.S. military, which also includes $2 million for expanding the arms repair plant for South Vietnam. Japanese arms dealers are preparing to make a fortune. On June 8, the "Defense Production Committee" of the "Federation of Economic Organizations" decided on the policy of exporting weapons to Southeast Asia and newly established an "Export Committee" to prepare to accept orders for warships from Thailand and jet trainer aircraft from Indonesia. Kogoro Uemura, vice chairman of the "Federation of Economic Organizations," once again proposed the "Uemura Plan" for exporting munitions to Southeast Asia, namely, Japan would use Japanese yen to purchase weapons that Japan cannot manufacture from the United States, and the United States would use the yen to order weapons from Japan and ship them to Southeast Asia.
          A Pipe Dream
    Japan's realization of its new conspiracy of economic expansion in Southeast Asia will not be smooth sailing. First of all, it will encounter dissatisfaction and opposition from various Southeast Asian countries. After the war, Japan has been implementing a one-sided dumping policy towards Southeast Asia, and using its trade surplus with Southeast Asia to make up for its trade deficit with the United States. Last year, it used Southeast Asia as a target for transferring the economic crisis, with a trade surplus of more than $222.2 million, the highest record since the war. Therefore, Southeast Asian countries have protested one after another, and warned Japan that if it does not increase imports from their countries, they will restrict the import of Japanese goods. For example, Thailand has been in a trade deficit with Japan for five years, and last year's trade deficit of 83% was caused by Japan's dumping policy. Thailand has made it clear that if Japan does not increase its purchase of rice and rubber, Thailand is prepared to increase tariffs and restrict the import of Japanese goods. Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, and South Vietnam have also made similar demands. As for the countries that have accepted Japanese loans and "assistance," they have all made sharp criticisms of Japan. According to Japanese Ambassador to India Hiroshi Nasu (see the "Tokyo Shimbun" on March 18 this year), India is very dissatisfied because Japan has been making things difficult and imposing too many restrictions on the use of yen loans in India. Up to now, although the total amount of Japanese loans to India has reached $70 million, only one contract worth approximately $400,000 has been signed in more than a year. The British "Economist" magazine reported that India has launched a major attack on the restrictions on the use of Japanese loans and demanded that the restrictions be revised. Cambodia and Laos, which accepted Japanese "assistance," sharply criticized Japan's so-called "technical assistance" as "cumbersome conditions" when Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama visited in May this year. Cambodia cited the example of Chinese and Soviet aid, which is completely controlled by Cambodia and does not carry any conditions, which made Fujiyama return in disappointment. Speaking of the "economic cooperation" agreement signed with the compensation agreement, Japan and Burma have signed it for four years, but not a single piece of so-called "economic cooperation" has been realized. The "economic cooperation" agreement signed with the Philippines and the "cooperation" of private capital have also yielded no results. Therefore, Saburo Seki, a councilor of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lamented: Southeast Asian national consciousness is very strong, the Philippines has very strict restrictions on foreign capital, and Indonesia's attitude is tough, believing that "Japan can lend if it wants to, and can forget about it if it doesn't." What's more, the people of Southeast Asian countries still remember the humiliation, plunder, and massacre by Japan in World War II, and will never allow Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" to make a comeback.
    Secondly, the establishment of the European "Common Market" and the free exchange of currencies in Western European countries show that the European and African markets have formed a group, and the competition among imperialists in Southeast Asia will be unprecedentedly sharp. Kyodo News Agency said on April 8 that West Germany's provision of low-interest and long-term loans has invaded Japan's traditional market in Southeast Asia, and the Japanese steel and machinery industries are very worried about West Germany's competition. In fact, Pakistan announced on June 15 that West Germany would provide Pakistan with a loan of 170 million West German marks, and according to foreign reports, West Germany and Indonesia have organized two joint ventures and are preparing to invest $750 million in Southeast Asian countries. In contrast, Japan's total foreign exchange is only one billion U.S. dollars, which is really a small fish in front of a big fish compared to West Germany. Speaking of the contradictions between Britain and Japan in Southeast Asia, that is well known. If we compare 1956 with 1952, the increase rate of Japan's exports to the Southeast Asian sterling area is 17.59%, while Britain has fallen behind Japan, with only 10.74%. Therefore, Nobusuke Kishi openly admitted that economic conflicts often occur between Britain and Japan, and plans to discuss the matter with Britain during his upcoming visit to Britain. As for the United States, Southeast Asia is also one of its main markets. The so-called support for Japan is limited to giving Japan a little taste of sweetness only when it is beneficial to itself and sufficient to control Japan. If it touches the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, the so-called "support" and encouragement for Japan to develop in Southeast Asia will all go bankrupt. It is enough to cite one example to illustrate the rest. According to Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun," at the end of last year, Nagada Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in Japan won the bid in India for a complete set of coal preparation equipment worth 3.3 billion yen, but due to pressure from U.S. companies, it had to swallow its anger and give up the order when formally signing the contract. This shows that the United States will only provide limited assistance when Japanese goods do not threaten the United States. Once it touches the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, assistance turns into resistance. Therefore, it is difficult for Japanese monopoly capital and the Nobusuke Kishi government to rely on the United States to squeeze out Britain and West Germany, and they cannot avoid conflicts of interest with the United States itself in Southeast Asia.
  Under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the Asian national movement is rising day by day, and the Japanese people have also awakened and will never allow Japanese militarism to revive. The lives of imperialists will not be very long. The Japanese potential imperialism, which is hostile to the Asian people, no matter what new conspiracy it uses, under the opposition of the Asian people and the Japanese people, its economic expansion plan of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" will eventually be a pipe dream.

    日本对东南亚经济扩张的新阴谋 
    张廷铮
    在日美加紧策划修改日美“安全条约”，建立新的“日美军事同盟”的今天，日本垄断资本便极力想以在军事上进一步投靠美国为代价，换取美国的支持，加紧向东南亚地区扩张。
    最近以来，日本对东南亚经济扩张的新阴谋是，配合美国制造远东紧张局势的战略要求，制订长期的全面的经济扩张计划，企图先行占领主要市场，以便应付行将到来的帝国主义国家在东南亚市场的激烈竞争。
          有空就钻
    今年4月4日，艾森豪威尔发表演说，大谈日本在亚洲反共的重要性，鼓励日本向东南亚发展。日本岸信介集团马上以为有机可乘，就要求美国帮助它而不要阻挠它解决对南越的赔偿问题。而这一违反日内瓦协议的“赔偿协定”终于在美国的默许下在5月13日签字。同时，日本利用美国企图拉拢民族主义国家和这些国家的经济困难，对印度增加了一千万美元的贷款，同去年两笔信贷合计，共达七千万美元。此外，还要求日美合作“开发”印度的贝拉第拉大铁矿。但是日本今年扩张的主要目标是印度尼西亚，据日本“时事通讯社”透露，日本政府决定以印度尼西亚为扩张“重点”，理由是印度尼西亚资源丰富、人力众多，并且是社会主义阵营和“自由主义势力”之间的“结合点”，是“东南亚条约组织”和“东北亚集团”之间的“结合点”，因此，“美国似将利用日本的技术”对印度尼西亚进行“经济援助”，同时日本还企图以印度尼西亚为中心形成在东南亚的“广域市场”。
    今年以来，日本对印度尼西亚真是在“倾窠进攻”了。而其特点是利用一切办法取得美国资本的援助。例如，日本建议利用美国“开发贷款资金”共同“出资建筑”北苏门答腊的阿苏汗河水坝，而这个计划是第二次世界大战中，印度尼西亚被日军占领时，由当时日本工业公司的工藤宏规所调查设计的。日本又要求将美国输往印度尼西亚的剩余棉花十万包，全部交由日本加工，加工费在赔偿中扣除。日本丸善石油公司和美国联合石油公司最近将联合组成一个新的石油公司，合作“开发”印度尼西亚和东南亚地区的石油资源。日本政府还提议以赔偿为担保贷款给印度尼西亚二千五百万美元，其中二千万美元供购买成套设备之用，其余以三百万和二百万美元分别购买日本缺乏销路的纺织品和陶瓷器。此外，日本对印度尼西亚第一年度的战争赔款亦达三千二百万美元，除用船舶九艘作价七百二十万美元（其中旧船价格竟高于新船价格）外，其余款项计划供推销成套设备和轻工业品之用。由此可见，日本对印度尼西亚的扩张的新阴谋是，以日美合作为基础，以战争赔偿为支柱，企图借此掠夺资源、占领市场并影响印度尼西亚的外交政策，以期实现日美的政治阴谋。日本外务相藤山在今年1月4日的“东京新闻”上说，“东南亚的经济即政治”，这倒是把日本“经济合作”的实质一语道破了。
    所谓“新经济外交”
    日本外务省在制订今年的对外扩张计划时，提出了所谓“新经济外交”的方针。其中规定：为了日本经济将来的发展和扩大，以东南亚作为对象进行培养，并采取“赔偿”与经济
  “援助”相结合的贸易政策。而岸信介在今年6月6日的内阁会议上，已命令内阁制定一个“在长期基础上同东南亚全部地区进行经济合作的制度”。根据日本和东南亚各国业已签订或决定签订的各种经济协定加以计算，在二十年内，预定可供支出的款项共约达十九亿美元。其中，对缅甸、菲律宾、印度尼西亚和南越的赔偿计达十亿零一千二百万美元，随赔偿协定签订的“经济合作”协定达七亿四千二百万美元，此外，则为对印度等国的贷款等等。这就是日本提出的“新经济外交”和拟订长期全面扩张计划的基础。而长期扩张计划的中心内容是“农业东南亚、工业日本”，目的是以东南亚为倾销日本轻重工业品的市场和掠夺原料的来源。
    日本外相藤山在今年3月召集驻亚洲和太平洋使领人员会议时，已透露了这一长期扩张计划的内容。他说，日本的“亚洲外交，已结束了战后的处理阶段，现在进入了展开新的积极外交的时期”，对亚洲经济不发达国家的“开发”，主要是“开发”天然资源、培养中小企业和设立“技术中心”。
    日本以东南亚作为供应原料的基地，这是众所周知的事实。近年来日本每年输入铁矿砂约八百万吨，其中80％来自东南亚，而马来亚所供给的约占日本铁矿砂使用量三分之一。今年3月，日本钢铁代表团赴印度，要求在鲁尔克拉铁矿外，由日美印合作开发贝拉第拉铁矿，并且估计在1966年度，日本每年可由印度进口铁矿砂八百万吨（贝拉第拉四百万吨、鲁尔克拉二百万吨、印度贸易公团二百万吨）。此外，日本尚拟开采缅甸的铁矿、石油、锑矿，染指菲律宾的铁矿、铜矿，泰国的锡矿等等。而目前日本开采中的矿区，已达十五处。
    日本为阻挠东南亚国家发展民族经济、取得真正的独立，极力散布经济不发达国家不应建立重工业的谬论。日本资产阶级报刊和广播，认为东南亚的外汇不足，经济困难不是由于不等价交换的结果，而是由于进行基本建设的错误。今后应该效法日本明治维新初期的情况，先办中小企业，发展农林业，以后也不必要求用生产资料支付赔偿。而最近访问东南亚的日本各种代表团，都一致鼓吹日本应在中小企业方面与东南亚合作。
    最值得注意的是，日美垄断资本为了加剧远东的紧张局势，企图在东南亚挑起战争和制造内乱，准备由日本大量承制武器和军需用品供给东南亚各国，使日本成为美国在远东的兵工厂。最近美国一举向日本为东南亚订购了军用卡车五千三百一十二辆，加上其他附件订货总额达六十八亿三千万美元。而日本与南越吴庭艳集团签订的“赔偿协定”，主要是建设加强军事基地和供应美军设施之用的水电站，其中还包括为南越扩建武器修理厂费用二百万美元。日本军火商人正准备大发横财，今年6月8日“经济团体联合会”的“防卫生产委员会”决定了向东南亚输出武器的方针，并新设立一个“输出委员会”，准备接受泰国的军舰订货和印度尼西亚的喷气式教练机订货。而“经济团体联合会”副会长植村甲午郎再度提出向东南亚输出军火的“植村计划”，即由日本用日元向美国购买日本不能制造的武器，再由美国用这笔日元向日本订购武器输往东南亚。
          一场春梦
    日本要实现对东南亚经济扩张的新阴谋决不会是一帆风顺的。首先它要遭到东南亚各国的不满和反对。战后日本对东南亚一直执行片面倾销政策，并以对东南亚的出超来弥补对美贸易的入超，而去年更以东南亚作为转嫁经济危机的对象，贸易出超达二亿二千二百余万美元，出现了战后的最高纪录。因此，东南亚各国已纷纷提出抗议，并警告日本如不增加从该国的进口，即将限制日货的输入。例如泰国，五年来对日贸易一直入超，去年的贸易赤字83％是由日本倾销政策所造成。泰国已明白表示，如果日本不增加对大米、橡胶的采购，泰国准备提高关税，限制日货进口。而缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦和南越也提出了类似的要求。至于接受日本贷款和“援助”的国家，都对日本提出了尖锐的批评。据日本驻印度大使那须皓自供
  （见今年3月18日“东京新闻”），由于日本在印度使用日元贷款时百般刁难，限制太严，印度甚为不满。迄今为止，日本对印度贷款总额虽达七千万美元，但年余以来仅订立为数约四十万美元的合同一件。英国“经济学家”杂志报道，印度对日本贷款的使用限制已大加攻击，并要求修改限制办法。而接受日本“援助”的柬埔寨、老挝，今年5月当日本外务相藤山进行访问时，对日本的所谓“技术援助”，认为“条件繁琐”，提出了尖锐的批评。柬埔寨并引中苏援助完全由柬埔寨支配，不附带任何条件为例，弄得藤山败兴而返。谈到随赔偿协定而签订的“经济合作”协定，日本与缅甸已签订四年，但所谓“经济合作”尚未实现一件。与菲律宾签订的“经济合作”协定、民间资本的“合作”也毫无成绩。因此，日本外务省审议官关守三郎慨叹说：东南亚民族意识很强烈，菲律宾对外资限制甚严，印度尼西亚的态度强硬，认为“日本愿借就借，不借就拉倒”。何况，东南亚各国人民对日本在第二次世界大战中的凌辱、掠夺和屠杀，还历历如昨，决不会允许日本的“大东亚共荣圈”卷土重来。
    其次，欧洲“共同市场”的成立，西欧各国的货币自由兑换，说明欧洲、非洲市场业已形成集团，今后帝国主义在东南亚的竞争将空前尖锐。共同社4月8日说，西德提供低利和长期贷款已侵入日本传统市场的东南亚，日本钢铁和机械工业十分担心西德的竞争。事实上，6月15日巴基坦斯宣布，西德将向巴基斯坦提供一亿七千万西德马克的贷款，而据外电所传，西德和印度尼西亚已组织了两个合资公司，并准备以七亿五千万美元向东南亚各国投资。反观日本全部外汇不过十亿美元，与西德相比真是大巫见小巫了。提到日英在东南亚的矛盾，那是众所周知的。如果以1956年与1952年相比，日本对东南亚英镑区的出口增加率为17.59％，而英国反落后于日本，仅为10.74％。因此，岸信介公开承认日英在经济方面经常发生冲突，并拟在最近访英时与英国商谈。至于美国，东南亚也是它的主要市场之一，所谓对日本的支持只限于对其本身有利而又足以控制日本时才给日本尝点甜头。如果一触犯美国垄断资本的利益时，所谓“支持”和鼓励日本向东南亚发展的议论也就全部破产。这只要举一例就足以概其余了。据日本“读卖新闻”报道，去年年底日本永田制作所在印度投标获得了价值三十三亿日元的选煤机全套设备的订货，但由于美国公司施加压力，在正式签订合同的时候只好忍气吞声放弃了这份订单。这就说明，只有当日本货不威胁美国时，美国才会给予有限的援助，一旦触及美国垄断资本的利益时，帮助就变成了抵制。因此，日本垄断资本和岸信介政府想依靠美国排挤英国和西德既有困难，就是和美国本身在东南亚也不能不发生利害冲突。
  在东风压倒西风的形势下，亚洲民族运动日益高涨，日本人民也已觉醒，决不允许日本军国主义死灰复燃。帝国主义者的寿命不会很长久了，与亚洲人民为敌的日本潜在帝国主义，不管它施展什么新阴谋，在亚洲人民和日本人民的反对下，它的“大东亚共荣圈”翻版的经济扩张计划，终将是一场春梦。
