　　Appreciating "Snowy Night"
　　Song Shuang
    A comrade I respect said that Wang Wenshi always observes and reflects life with a smile, giving people a sense of freshness and joy. After continuously reading the short story collection "Snowy Night," I feel that for most of the works within, this is indeed a concise and apt comment.
                        ＊　＊　＊
    The "Snowy Night" short story collection contains eleven short stories. Except for one or two weaker pieces, I like the other works. These works reflect the rural life and various ordinary laborers in recent years under the Zhongnan Mountains and on both sides of the Wei River. I have not been to Shaanxi, so naturally I don't know the natural scenery, local customs, folk characteristics, language, habits, etc., of the eight hundred li of Qinchuan, but from this short story collection, I felt some of the local flavor of this region.
    Praising the new life and new people is the keynote of this short story collection. This keynote is shared by many of our writers. How does Wang Wenshi "sing" it?
                        ＊　＊　＊
    Compared to some works I have read, Wang Wenshi's praise of new life and new people, I feel, is more adept at reflecting the spirit of our times and the trend of life's development from the ordinary life and ordinary people. The three short stories "Snowy Night," "The Old Man," and "The Great Carpenter" portray three new characters with different personalities. These three characters have the new qualities common to general new people, but they do not have the exciting heroic achievements common to general new people. At first glance, these ordinary people are commonplace, but reading them carefully makes you feel that the spirit of the times is burning in them. In the short story "Snowy Night," there is almost no story, and the author does not meticulously depict the characters' noses and eyes, but the description of the natural scenery and the vibrant rural life has a strong atmosphere of the times, setting off the image of the protagonist, District Committee Secretary Yan Keqin. His attitude towards work is not just generally serious, responsible, hardworking, active, and capable, etc., but he appears as the master of the era. As soon as Yan Keqin appears, he is in an environment of roaring winds and rolling snow waves: "Trees are breaking and roaring; the rolling wind, carrying torrential snow waves, rushes and surges in the streets and alleys, as if to destroy the entire village in an instant. The roads are all covered with snow. The wind and snow hit people so hard that they can't open their eyes." It was precisely on such a cold, snowy New Year's Eve in 1955 that he was singing leisurely in the wilderness, going to a village to "accept" the newly established agricultural production cooperative. I feel that the magnificent power of the strong wind and heavy snow sets off the image of this character, or rather, it is a portrayal of the character's inner character. In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, he earnestly taught the grassroots cadres he led to "think ahead, act ahead, and walk in front"; he used meticulous working methods and far-sighted thinking to enlighten and help grassroots cadres on how to calculate detailed accounts, tap potential, and formulate a production plan and per-mu yield target for the 1956 Great Leap Forward; when "the rooster sang the third song," he ended the work in one village, and another new job began. These descriptions show his majestic momentum, revolutionary spirit of advancing bravely, and selfless dedication to building a new life.
      The short story "The Old Man" can also be said to have no fascinating plots or stories, but the "old man's" voice, smile, and inner character are written vividly on the paper, making people feel that the growth of this socialist new person is an inevitable trend in the development of our era. It shows the influence of the Party and the new life on the growth of the old man with a poetic daily life. It is difficult for us to forget such a scene: the "I" in
  “a common, spring chill weather,” giving a Party class to people on the sports field of Liu Jia Temple Elementary School, because of heavy fog and cold weather, the increasing commotion of the crowd in the venue caused "I was a little flustered, the speed of my speech, could not help but speed up... even I could not hear what I was saying," but in the pile of women, "stood a white-haired old mother," "The wind and snow surrounded her, she did not seem to notice at all, and the surrounding rumbling whispers did not disturb her in the slightest. Her expression gave me great encouragement, so that I calmed down from the panic. My thoughts and language re-entered the track, and the venue followed suit...". This old mother is the protagonist of the work. Why did she listen to the Party class so attentively? The author did not answer, or even describe her positively in a sentence, but anyone can enrich and supplement the image of the old man based on their understanding of the new man. Because in her single plot of attentively listening to the Party class, there is a vast space left for readers to imagine. Continuing to read, we will feel that this is an old man with the fiery heart of a young man from the author's series of fresh and simple descriptions of her determination to resolutely take the socialist road, love the community as her home, the spirit of vigorously moving forward, and her trying every means to go to the district with the Communist Youth League members to listen to the cotton high-yield experience. Because her past life experience is: "Relying on the mountains, the mountains collapse, relying on the water, the water flows." From today's real life, she has found a never-collapsing backer - the agricultural cooperative led by the Party. Therefore, she has blended her own destiny with the destiny of the agricultural cooperative, and has generated new ideas and feelings and the determination to follow the Party to march towards communism.
    The image of the carpenter in "The Great Carpenter" is also such a new person. In him, we can no longer find the old ideas and old habits left over from the old society, it can be said that he is almost insulated from private ownership. In order to reduce the labor intensity of the commune members and improve labor efficiency, he devoted himself to agricultural technology reform, neglecting food and sleep, not seeking fame and profit, and even sacrificing his own work points; he suffered all kinds of ridicule from his family and some people in the village, and all kinds of cold words did not stop his hard research. His interest grew bigger and bigger, his spirit became more and more concentrated, and he even used the money his wife gave him to go to the market to buy things to entertain his son-in-law to buy four pounds of iron to make reformed farm tools. Especially his attitude towards his old friend for many years, Li Shuan, who set up an iron goods stall. Li Shuan asked him with a hippie smile how much the government rewarded him for making five new farm tools, his "lungs were about to explode" and he deeply felt that this was an "insult" to him. Compared to the old countryside, this is a brand-new person. Naturally, strictly speaking, the image of the great carpenter is not rich enough, and the beauty of the character's heart has not been fully explored.
    The author's criticism of the remnants of private ownership in Wang Yunhe's old man in "The Vegetable Seller" is full of cordial and friendly feelings. It makes you feel that the author deeply loves his characters and is full of optimism and confidence in overcoming the remnants of private ownership in them. For people like Wang Yunhe, the process of agricultural cooperation development is also the process of their being transformed and improved. It is precisely based on this belief that the author exposes and criticizes the social causes and habitual forces of the remnants of private ownership in Wang Yunhe. When Wang Yunhe first joined the community, he wanted to take advantage of the price of the gray mule, but he did not take advantage of it and lost face. Afterwards, he explained to Jiang Bo, the resident cadre of the community:
  "It's not like I wanted to sell the mule for a big price. I raised it with my own hands. It's been carting water and planting vegetables, and going to the market for so many years, like my own daughter... Knowing that I will always marry someone, but when the sedan chair arrives at the door, I am always a little reluctant!" Jiang Bo then took over and said: "Yes! Yes! Moreover, everyone has experienced and seen daughters getting married, but who has ever heard of land and livestock joining the community before! I don't believe anyone said that he wasn't nervous at all when he joined the community!" Wang Yunhe's words, although a bit of an excuse for himself (this excuse is very consistent with his character. Others have always called him "Active Uncle"; he has never been willing to fall behind on the surface; he felt very disgraced for losing face over the price of the mule, but he was unwilling to publicly admit selfishness.) But it also sincerely explained a truth: it is not easy for farmers to completely break with the concept of private ownership. After he joined the community, some old ideas and old habits still dragged him back. The community sent him to the market to sell vegetables, he looked at the market, sprinkled water in the vegetables... He always planned to earn more money for his community. On the surface, he was not for his own benefit, but for their community. In fact, this kind of behavior of harming others and benefiting himself was still another manifestation of his private ownership. The author arranged a series of dramatic plots to criticize Wang Yunhe's old man for this residual old consciousness and old habits, and criticized him in a unique and humorous way, so that he was educated. Finally, he said with emotion: "Life is like facing Mount Huashan. If you want to cultivate into a 'real person' and go to 'heaven', you have to go up one level, and then another level; climb one mountain, and then another mountain"!
    I think the author's criticism of Tie Dan Lao Ba in "Down the Well" shows the author's artistic talent again. He is so familiar with rural life, and so good at capturing dramatic plots to express characters. Tie Dan Lao Ba is a rich middle peasant image, his class characteristics and personality are expressed so clearly and unified. In the old society, he was an expert in "getting rich", unmatched in shrewdness and competence; after agricultural cooperation, he felt unable to resist the power of life's progress, but he still tried to grab as much as he could, and everywhere he used his tricks of harming the public and benefiting himself. Interestingly, the process of this character's transformation is full of comedy colors. His personal plans seem so foolish and ridiculous in the face of the new life, it is really "the devil grows one foot, the Dao grows ten feet", the new social life makes him "bump into walls everywhere", and even his living status and authority in the family have become weak, empty and ridiculous. Finally, under the influence of the advanced figure Ya Lai, he was deeply condemned by his conscience, and said heavily to Ya Lai: "Eighth Uncle is not human, he has no popularity", and then he went to work "madly".
    Reading Wang Wenshi's works makes me think: if the author is criticizing the shortcomings of the peasants with a smile, then this "smile" is precisely the most concentrated expression of the author's familiarity with the new rural life, the belief that advanced forces can overcome all old things, and the artistic talent to capture dramatic plots from daily life, combined. Familiar with the new life, he can so freely gather the impact of the new life's tide, washing away the shortcomings of the peasants; believing that the advanced forces in the countryside can overcome all old things, he can reflect the contradictions and conflicts in life with an optimistic spirit; and in the end, he always lets the peasants with shortcomings of different degrees embark on the path of glory; he is good at capturing dramatic plots from daily life, so that his works have formed a common artistic style that is just beginning to take shape - fresh, humorous, and full of comedy colors.
    Secondly, I also feel that works such as "The Vegetable Seller," "Down the Well," and "Around the Spring Festival" are all lovable, but lack a strong power to shake people's hearts. What is the reason? "Is it a defect in writing skills? Is it a defect in the selection of materials, or not drilling into the depths of things, or drilling into the depths of things without grasping its profound and simple essence?" (Du Pengcheng "A Letter to Wang Wenshi", see "Literary Gazette" No. 3, 1959) I have also imagined this, perhaps because the author in order to maintain the unity of his artistic style, in order to always leave the reader with a fresh, humorous and joyful impression, therefore avoided the description of the sharpness and complexity of the contradictions and conflicts in life, especially avoided the description of the process of change of the character's inner contradictions, so that it "does not strongly move people's hearts"? I still can't figure it out for a while, but I love his current artistic style that is just beginning to take shape.

　　赏“风雪之夜”
　　宋爽
    有位我所尊敬的同志说，王汶石总是带着微笑观察生活，反映生活，给人一种清新的喜悦。当我连续地读完了“风雪之夜”短篇小说集，觉得就其中大部分作品说来，这确是一句言简意赅的评语。
                        ＊　＊　＊
    “风雪之夜”短篇小说集，共收有十一个短篇。除去其中一、二篇较差外，其它作品我都喜欢。这些作品反映了终南山下、渭河两岸近年来的农村生活面貌和形形色色的普通劳动者。我没有到过陕西，自然也不了解八百里秦川的自然景物、风土人情、民性特征、语言、风习等等，但是从这个短篇集里，我感受到了这一地区的一些地方色彩。
    歌颂新生活、新人物，是这个短篇小说集的基调。这个基调为我们许多作家所共有，王汶石又“唱”得怎样呢？
                        ＊　＊　＊
    王汶石对新生活新人物的歌颂，和我所读过的一些作品相比，我觉得他更善于从平淡无奇的生活里面和普通人的身上，反映出我们的时代精神和生活发展的趋向。“风雪之夜”“老人”“大木匠”这三个短篇刻划了三个性格不同的新人物。这三个人物具有一般新人所共有的新的品质，却没有一般新人所共有的激动人心的英雄业迹。乍看起来，这些普通人平平常常，细读起来，又使你感到在他们身上都燃烧着时代的精神火焰。“风雪之夜”这个短篇里，几乎没有什么故事，作者也没有精雕细刻地描画人物的鼻眼，但对自然景物、农村生气勃勃的生活描写，具有强烈的时代气氛，烘托出了主人公区委书记严克勤的形象。他对待工作不是一般的认真负责、任劳任怨、积极、能干等等，而是以时代主人的姿态出现的。严克勤一出场，便置身于狂风怒吼，雪浪翻滚的环境里：“树木折裂着，狂号着；那滚滚的狂风，卷着滔滔的雪浪，在街巷里急驶猛冲，仿佛要在瞬息之间把整个村庄毁掉似的。道路全被雪盖住了。风雪打得人睁不开眼。”也正是在这样一个严寒的风雪交加的1955年的除夕，他在旷野“却悠然自得地唱呀唱的”，前去一个村“验收”新建立的农业生产合作社。我觉得，这里大风大雪的雄姿伟力，烘托了这个人物形象，或者说，正是这个人物内在性格的写照。他在农业合作化高潮中，谆谆教导他所领导的基层干部“要思考在前，动作在前，要走在前面”；他以细致入微的工作方法和高瞻远瞩的思想，启发、帮助基层干部如何算细账、挖潜力，制订1956年跃进的生产计划和亩产指标；当“雄鸡唱起第三支歌曲”的时候，他结束了一个村的工作，另一种新的工作又开始了。在这些描写里，显现了他的气势磅礴，勇往直前的革命精神，忘我地投身于建设新生活的热情。
      “老人”这个短篇，可以说也没有什么引人入胜的情节和故事，但那个“老人”的声音笑貌和内在性格，却写得跃然纸上，使人感到这个社会主义新人的成长，就是我们时代生活发展的一种必然趋势。它以诗意盎然的日常生活，展示了党和新生活对老人成长的影响。我们很难忘记这样一个场面：作品的“我”在
  “一个常见的，春寒料峭的天气”，在刘家寺小学的运动场上给人们讲党课，由于雾重天寒，北风凛冽，引起了会场上人群越来越大的骚动，这使“我有些慌乱了，讲话的速度，不由得加快……连我自己也听不清我在说些什么”，但是在妇女堆里，“巍然站立着一个两鬓霜白的老妈妈”，“风雪包围着她，她似乎一点也没有察觉，周围的隆隆细语，也对她没有一丝半点的骚扰。她的神情给我极大的鼓励，使我从慌乱中镇静下来。我的思想和语言重新走上轨道，会场也跟着平静下来……”。这位老妈妈就是作品中的主人公。她为什么那样聚精会神听党课？作者没有解答，甚至也没有正面描写她一句，可是谁都可以根据自己对新人的理解，来丰富和补充这位老人的形象。因为她聚精会神听党课那一个单纯的情节里面，潜伏着任凭读者联想的广阔的余地。接着读下去，我们从作者对她坚决走社会主义道路的决心，爱社如家，蓬蓬勃勃的向前精神，以及她想尽办法和共青团员同去区上听讲棉花丰产经验等一连串清新、朴素的描写中，便会感到这是一个有着年青人火热的心的老人。因为她过去的生活经历是：“靠山山崩，靠水水流”。从今天的现实生活里，她找到了永不塌陷的靠山——党所领导的农业合作社。因此，她把自己的命运和农业社的命运水乳交融地结合在一起，便产生了新的思想感情和跟着党向共产主义迈进的决心。
    “大木匠”中的木匠的形象，也是这样的新人。在他的身上，已经找不到旧社会残留下来的旧思想、旧习惯，可以说他几乎和私有观念绝缘了。他为了减轻社员们的劳动强度，提高劳动效率，废寝忘食、不图名利，甚至牺牲自己的工分，醉心于农业技术改革；他受尽了家庭的和村里某些人的冷嘲热讽，各种冷言冷语都没有阻止他的刻苦钻研。他的兴趣越来越大，精神越来越集中，甚至把他老婆交给他到集上买东西招待女婿的钱，又称了四斤铁做改革农具用。特别是他对他多年前的老朋友、摆铁货摊的李栓的态度。李栓嘻皮笑脸地探问他造了五件新农具得到政府的奖赏有多少，他“肺都要气炸了”，深深感到这是对他的“侮辱”。比之旧农村，这是一个崭新的人。自然，严格说来，大木匠的形象还不够丰满，人物心灵的美没有被充分挖掘出来。
    作者对“卖菜者”里的王云河老汉身上残存的私有观念的批判，是充满亲切和友谊的感情的。使你感到作者深深地爱他的人物，并对他们身上残存的私有观念的克服，充满着乐观和信心。对王云河这类人说来，农业合作化发展的过程，也就是他们被改造、被提高的过程。作者正是根据这样的信念，揭露和批判了残存在王云河身上的私有观念的社会原因和习惯势力。王云河老汉刚入社时，为了青骡子作价问题，想占点小便宜，结果没占上便宜反而丢了脸。事后他对驻社干部江波这样解释：
  “也并非想把骡子卖个大价钱，那是我一手喂养大的，它跟我车水种菜，赶集上会多少年，像我的女儿一样亲……明知总要嫁人，可是轿到门口，总有些舍不得啊！”江波便接过来说：“是啊！是啊！何况女儿出嫁是谁也经过、谁也见过的事情，而土地牲口入社，从前谁倒听说过啊！谁说他入社时一点也没有紧张过，我倒不相信哩！”王云河老汉的那段话，虽然有点为自己辩解的味道（这辩解很符合他的性格特征。别人一向称他“积极叔”；他在表面上也从来不甘落后；为骡子作价问题丢了脸，感到很不光彩，但又不愿公开承认自私。）却也真诚地说明了一个道理：农民彻底和私有制观念决裂不是件容易事情。他入社后，仍然有某些旧意识、旧习惯拖住了他的脚步。社里派他到集市上卖菜，他看行市，往菜里洒水……总盘算给自己社里多挣点钱，表面上看起来，他并非为了一己之利，而是为了他们的社，实际上这种损人利己的行为，仍是他的私有观念的另一种表现。对王云河老汉这种残存的旧意识旧习惯的批判，作者安排了一系列富有戏剧性的情节，别具风趣地批评了他，使他受到了教育。最后他感慨地说：“人生一世，就像朝华山，要想修成‘真人’，走上‘天堂’，就得上一级，再一级；登一山，再一山啊”！
    我认为作者对“井下”里的铁旦老八的批判，又显示了作者的艺术才能。他是那样熟悉农村生活，又那样善于捕捉戏剧性的情节来表现人物。铁旦老八是个富裕中农形象，他的阶级特征和个性表现得那样鲜明而统一。他在旧社会是个“发家致富”的能手，精明干练得无可匹敌；农业合作化后，他感到无法抗拒生活前进的力量，但还本着能多捞一点就多捞一点，到处施展他损公利己的伎俩。有趣的是，这个人物的被改造的过程，充满着喜剧的色彩。他的个人打算在新生活面前显得那样愚蠢可笑，真是“魔长一尺，道高一丈”，新的社会生活使他“到处碰壁”，甚至他在家庭的生活地位和权威也变得无力、空虚和可笑了。最后他在先进人物亚来的感化下，深深地受到了良心的责备，向亚来沉重地说了一声：“八叔不是人，没人气”，便“发疯地”劳动去了。
    读了王汶石的作品，使我想到：如果说作者是带着微笑来批判农民身上的缺点的话，那么这种“微笑”，正是作者熟悉农村新生活、相信先进力量可以战胜一切旧事物，以及善于从日常生活中捕捉戏剧情节的艺术才能，三者相结合的最集中的表现。熟悉新生活，他才能那样运用自如地汇集新生活的潮流冲击、洗刷农民身上的缺点；相信农村先进力量可以战胜一切旧事物，他才能以乐观主义精神来反映生活中的矛盾冲突；而且最后总是让具有程度深浅不同的缺点的农民都走上了光辉的道路；他善于从日常生活中捕捉戏剧性的情节，才使他的作品形成了一个共同的初具雏型的艺术风格——清新、幽默、富于喜剧色彩。
    其次，我也觉得，“卖菜者”“井下”和“春节前后”等作品，都惹人喜爱，但是缺乏强烈地振撼人心的力量。原因何在？“是写作技巧方面有缺陷？是选材有缺陷，或者没有钻到事物深处，抑或钻到事物深处而没有抓住它深刻而又单纯的本质？”（杜鹏程“给王汶石的一封信”，见“文艺报”1959年第三期）我也曾经这样设想过，也许是由于作者为了维护自己艺术风格的统一，为了始终给读者留下一个清新、幽默和喜悦的印象，因此回避了生活中矛盾冲突的尖锐性、复杂性的描写，特别是回避了人物内心矛盾冲突的变化过程的描写，从而“并不强烈地动人心魄”的吧？我一时还想不清楚，但是，我爱他现在的初具雏型的艺术风格。
