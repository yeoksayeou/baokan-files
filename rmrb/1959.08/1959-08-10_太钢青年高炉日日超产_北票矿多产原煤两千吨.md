Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th: The workers of the Youth Blast Furnace at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company exceeded their iron production plan every day in the first week of August. During this week, the average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached 2.382 tons, and the qualified rate of pig iron reached 100%.

Since the beginning of August, all the workers at the Youth Blast Furnace have launched a competition to seize and tackle the key issue of poor raw material quality. Workers in the raw materials workshop strengthened ore sintering, increasing the amount of rich ore entering the furnace. They particularly improved the firing operation method, reducing the iron oxide in the sintered ore from 27% to 12% and increasing the iron content from 43% to 50%, thereby creating conditions for stabilizing the furnace conditions and improving the quality and output of pig iron. The workers in the blast furnace duty room adjusted the furnace top in a timely manner, increasing the gas utilization rate from 6% in July to 13%. The taphole workers also strengthened the maintenance work on the taphole, eliminating accidents in front of the furnace.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th: Miners at the Beipiao Coal Mine in Liaoning completed their daily plans in the first week of August, increasing the national coal production by more than 2,000 tons. Compared with the same period in July, the average daily coal output increased by more than 22%, and the daily footage of tunneling increased by 8%.

At the end of July and the beginning of August, the leaders of each mine carried out ideological education among the workers on "completing the plan early, not delaying it," reversing the past phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and tense at the end. At the same time, production leadership was strengthened, and leaders at all levels went down the wells every day to help the mining areas and coal mining sections solve specific problems and summarize and promote advanced experience. On August 1st, an on-site meeting was also held to exchange experiences in increasing production and practicing economy and technological innovation, so that all miners had a clear direction and learned methods.

    太钢青年高炉日日超产
    北票矿多产原煤两千吨
    据新华社太原9日电　太原钢铁公司青年高炉职工在8月的第一周里，天天都超额完成了产铁计划。这一周，高炉利用系数平均达到了二点三八二吨，生铁合格率达到了100％。
    进入8月以来，青年高炉上的全体职工针对着原料质量不好这一关键问题，开展了一个抢关键、攻关键的竞赛。原料车间的工人加强了矿石烧结，使入炉的富矿增多。他们特别改进了烧火操作方法，把烧结矿中的氧化铁由过去的27％降低到12％，含铁量由43％提高到50％，从而为稳定炉况、提高生铁的质量和产量创造了条件。高炉值班室的职工及时调剂了炉顶，使煤气使用率由7月份的6％提高到13％。炉前工也加强了出铁口的维护工作，消灭了炉前事故。
    据新华社沈阳9日电　辽宁北票煤矿矿工8月第一周日日完成计划，为国家增产了两千多吨煤。和7月份同期相比，采煤平均日产量提高了22％以上，掘进日进尺提高了8％。
    7月末、8月初，各矿的领导都向职工进行了“提前不拉后”的思想教育，扭转过去月初松月末紧的现象。同时，加强生产领导，各级领导干部天天下井，帮助采区和采煤段解决具体问题，总结和推广先进经验。在8月1日，还召开了现场会议，交流增产节约和技术革新的经验，使全体矿工都明确了方向、学到了办法。
