　　The US Steel Strike Has Huge Impact
　　Severely Insufficient Operation, Industrial Production Declines
    (Reported in this newspaper) The steel strike, which began on July 15th, has already caused the US industrial production index for July to drop by two points, from 155 in June (with 1947 to 1949 as 100) to 153. Due to the steelworkers' continued strike, the operating rate of the steel industry dropped from 90% in June to 44% in July. The decline in the steel industry's operating rate is the main reason for this decline in industrial production, but it is not the only reason. For example, the five major automobile companies that produce more than 90% of the automobiles in the United States also produced 3,000 fewer cars in July than in June.
    The sharp decline in steel production is having a serious impact on the entire American economy. According to a report in the August issue of "Steel Magazine," not only are small steel users under serious threat, "but even large companies that cannot store large quantities of certain types of steel will have to reduce their operating rates this month."
    The shutdown of the steel industry has put great pressure on the declining railway transportation industry. According to a recent report in "U.S. News & World Report," due to the sharp decline in the volume of steel, coal, and iron ore being transported, railway freight volume in the first week of August has fallen by nearly 8% compared to July.
    The reduction in steel production is also having a negative impact on U.S. foreign trade. Originally, since the beginning of this year, the increase in U.S. steel imports and the decrease in exports have long been considered a loophole causing a large outflow of U.S. gold. In May, before the steel strike occurred, U.S. steel imports reached 385,000 tons, twice its exports, setting the highest record for steel imports in history. In June, the U.S. foreign trade already experienced its first trade deficit since the Korean War in 1950, and the increase in steel imports was also a factor. After July, the sharp decline in U.S. steel production is expected to worsen this unfavorable situation.

### 美国钢铁罢工影响巨大　开工严重不足工业生产下降

　　美国钢铁罢工影响巨大
　　开工严重不足工业生产下降
    本报讯　7月15日开始的钢铁大罢工已经使美国7月份工业生产指数下降了两点，从6月份的一五五（以1947年到1949年为一百）下降到一五三。由于钢铁工人坚持罢工，钢铁业开工率从6月份的90％下降到7月份的44％。钢铁业开工率的下降是造成这次工业生产下降的主要原因，但并不是唯一的原因。例如生产美国90％以上汽车的五家大汽车公司7月份也比6月份少生产了三千辆汽车。
    钢铁业生产的急剧下降正在对美国整个经济产生严重的影响。据8月份的“美国钢铁时代杂志”的报道，现在不仅钢铁的小用户已大受威胁，“甚至连那些不能大量储存某些种类钢铁的大公司，在本月也不得不降低它们的开工率”。
    钢铁业歇业使雕敝中的铁路运输业受到很大的压力。据最近“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志透露，由于钢料、煤炭和铁矿砂的运载量锐减，8月份第一周的铁路货运量比7月份已下降了近8％。
    钢铁的减产对美国的对外贸易也在产生恶劣影响。原来今年以来，美国钢铁进口的增加和出口的减少早已被认为是造成美国大量黄金外流的一个缺口。在钢铁罢工未发生前的5月份美国钢铁进口就达三十八万五千吨，两倍于它的出口，创历史上钢铁进口的最高纪录。6月份美国的对外贸易已出现了1950年朝鲜战争以来的第一次入超，钢铁进口的增加也是因素之一。7月份以后，美国钢铁生产的锐减，预料必将加重这一不利情况。
