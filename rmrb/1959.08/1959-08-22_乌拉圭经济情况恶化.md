Uruguay's economic situation is deteriorating daily. The struggle of the working people of Uruguay against rising prices, to win wage increases, and to demand that the government stop loan negotiations with the U.S.-controlled "International Monetary Fund" is intensifying.

According to a report in the Uruguayan "Adelante Semanal" on February 27, Uruguay's fiscal deficit is serious. From 1955 to 1958, the fiscal budget deficit was more than 330 million pesos. In 1958 alone, the budget deficit exceeded 100 million pesos. At the same time, the cost of living has risen sharply. In the ten years from 1948 to 1958, the cost of living nearly doubled.

According to materials published by the Uruguayan National Bureau of Statistics, taking the figures for 1943 as 100, food prices rose to 317.6 in January 1957, 339.8 in January 1958, and 525.9 in January 1959, an increase of 25.2% over the index for 1958.

The United States is taking advantage of Uruguay's economic difficulties to put pressure on the Uruguayan government through the "International Monetary Fund," which it controls, in an attempt to force Uruguay to accept enslaving loan conditions. A delegation from the "International Monetary Fund" arrived in Uruguay in early July to "investigate and study" Uruguay's economic and financial situation, preparing to propose measures to the Uruguayan government that should be taken to obtain U.S. loans. According to the Uruguayan "People's Daily," the conditions proposed by the "International Monetary Fund" are: freezing wages, large-scale layoffs of state employees, widespread implementation of "strict austerity" policies, reduction of state industrial sectors, devaluation of currency, and restriction of democratic freedoms and trade union rights, etc. All sectors of the Uruguayan people strongly protested the activities of the "International Monetary Fund" and demanded an immediate halt to negotiations with the organization.

　　乌拉圭经济情况恶化
    乌拉圭的经济情况日益恶化。乌拉圭劳动人民为反对物价上涨、争取增加工资和要求政府停止同美国操纵下的“国际货币基金组织”进行贷款谈判的斗争日趋高涨。
    据乌拉圭“前进周刊”2月27日报道，乌拉圭财政赤字严重。从1955年到1958年，财政预算赤字三亿三千多万比索。仅1958年一年，预算赤字就超过一亿比索。同时，生活费用急剧上涨。从1948年到1958年的十年中，生活费用上涨近一倍半。
    据乌拉圭国家统计局公布的材料，如以1943年的数字为一百，1957年1月食品上涨了317.6，1958年1月上涨到339.8，1959年1月上涨到525.9，等于比1958年的指数增加了25.2％。
    美国利用乌拉圭的经济困难，通过它控制的“国际货币基金组织”向乌拉圭政府施加压力，企图强使乌拉圭接受奴役性的贷款条件。“国际货币基金组织”的代表团于7月初到乌拉圭“调查和研究”乌拉圭的经济和财政情况，准备向乌拉圭政府提出为取得美国贷款所应采取的措施。据乌拉圭“人民报”揭露“国际货币基金组织”提出的条件是：冻结工资、大规模裁减国家职员、广泛实行“厉行节约”政策、消减国家工业部门、使货币贬值、限制民主自由和工会权利等等。乌拉圭各界人民严厉抗议“国际货币基金组织”的活动，要求立即停止同这个组织的谈判。（叶）
