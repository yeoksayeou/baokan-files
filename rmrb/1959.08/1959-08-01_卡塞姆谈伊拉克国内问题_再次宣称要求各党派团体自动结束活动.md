Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 30th - Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem discussed some recent domestic events at a press conference on the 29th. He reiterated that he would take "severe measures against those who incite and create these incidents."

Kassem asserted: "Certain newspapers repeatedly say there are conspiracies, and they are creating incidents that cause chaos among the people. I have fully investigated the chaos in this country, and you newspapers are responsible for this chaos." He said he did not want the words "conspiracy" or "suppression of democratic forces" to be repeated. "Anyone who writes about any conspiracy is a traitor."

Kassem attributed some of the atrocities that occurred during the recent events in Kirkuk to "anarchists." He declared that the government would suppress "all anarchists." He said, "Some photos of the Kirkuk incident show that certain groups are guilty." But "we will never blame a political party, an ideology, or a faction; we will blame certain individuals who should be responsible for what they have done."

Newspapers here have pointed out that the Kirkuk rebellion was part of an imperialist conspiracy timed specifically. Because the army units, in cooperation with the people's resistance forces, all democratic organizations, and people from all walks of life in Kirkuk, demonstrated resolve and decisiveness, the rebellion was quickly suppressed.

Kassem explained that he advocated democratic freedom. But he agreed with a reporter who said, "These freedoms are limited." He said: "Our country will never close any newspaper. But if some newspapers go beyond the limits, the owners of the newspapers will be brought to court." He said that the government allows the establishment of student unions, farmers' associations, and trade unions to improve their professional level, not for them to participate in party activities. He said: "If we find that any organization is unsuitable, we will disband it and hold new elections." Kassem also said: "I ask all parties, organizations, and groups to announce the end of their activities themselves. We are in a period of construction. When we complete the construction, you can do whatever you want. I will use offense to counter offense to stop the offense."

Kassem said that Iraq pursues a policy of neutrality and peace. It advocates "the unification of Iraq, solidarity with friendly Arab countries, and cooperation with friendly socialist countries and Western countries."

    卡塞姆谈伊拉克国内问题
    再次宣称要求各党派团体自动结束活动
    新华社巴格达30日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆29日在记者招待会上谈到了最近国内发生的一些事件。他重申要对那些煽动和制造这些事件的人采取严厉的措施”。
    卡塞姆断言：“某些报纸一再重复说有阴谋，它们并且制造了在人民中引起混乱的一些事件。我充分调查了这个国家发生的混乱，你们这些报纸要对这些混乱负责。”他说，我不希望“阴谋”或者“镇压民主力量”等等字眼一再被人重复。“凡是写关于什么阴谋的人都是叛徒。”
    卡塞姆把最近在基尔库克事件中发生的一些暴行归咎于“无政府主义者”。他宣称政府将镇压“一切无政府主义者”。他说，“一些关于基尔库克事件的照片说明某些集团是有罪的”。但是“我们决不责备某一个政党、某一种思想意识或某一个派别，我们将责备应当对自己所干的事情负责的某些个人”。
    此间报纸曾经指出，基尔库克叛乱是特别选好时机的帝国主义阴谋的一部分。由于陆军部队在人民抵抗部队和所有民主组织以及基尔库克各阶层群众的合作下，表现坚决果敢，叛乱被迅速镇压下去了。
    卡塞姆解释他是主张民主自由的。但是他同意一个记者所说的：
  “这些自由是有限制的”。他说：
  “我国决不封闭任何报纸。但如果有的报纸越出范围，将把报纸的所有人交付法庭审判。”他说，政府许可成立学生联合会、农民协会和工会，是为了提高它的职业水平，不是要它们参与党派活动。他说：
  “如果我们发现哪个组织不适合，我们将解散它并举行新的选举。”卡塞姆还说：“我要求各党派、各种组织和团体自己宣布结束活动。我们正处在建设时期，到我们完成建设的时候，你们想做什么就做什么。我将以进攻对付进攻，以此来制止进攻。”
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克执行中立和和平的政策。它主张“伊拉克的统一，同友好的阿拉伯国家团结，以及同友好的社会主义国家和西方国家合作。”
