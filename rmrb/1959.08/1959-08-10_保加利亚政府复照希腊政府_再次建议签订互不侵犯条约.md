Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 8th: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported that the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the Greek government on August 7th, expressing regret at the Greek government's rejection of the Bulgarian government's proposal to sign a treaty of non-aggression.

    On July 22nd of this year, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Greece in Sofia, suggesting that the two countries sign a treaty of non-aggression for a period of twenty years. In the note, the Bulgarian government stated its belief that the signing of a treaty of non-aggression between Bulgaria and Greece would make a valuable contribution to strengthening lasting peace in the Balkans and establishing an atmosphere of mutual trust and good neighborly cooperation between the two countries. A draft treaty of non-aggression was attached to the note.

    The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the Bulgarian government on July 31st, declaring that it could not accept this suggestion, using the excuse that both countries had signed the United Nations Charter, and according to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, all signatory countries had already declared that they would not use war as a means of resolving disputes.

    In its note of August 7th, the Bulgarian government emphasized that although the United Nations Charter exists, Greece is becoming a military strategic base for the aggressive bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and many member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization disregard the United Nations Charter and launch unprovoked military aggression against other countries, such as Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan. The Bulgarian government hopes that the Greek government will reconsider Bulgaria's proposal.

    保加利亚政府复照希腊政府
    再次建议签订互不侵犯条约
    新华社索非亚8日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚外交部8月7日复照希腊政府，对希腊政府拒绝保加利亚政府关于签订互不侵犯条约的建议表示遗憾。
    保加利亚外交部曾在今年7月22日交给希腊王国驻索非亚大使一份照会，建议两国签订为期二十年的互不侵犯条约。保加利亚政府在照会中表示相信，保希两国签订互不侵犯条约将对加强巴尔干持久和平和建立两国间的相互信任和睦邻合作气氛作出宝贵的贡献。照会中附有一份互不侵犯条约草案。
    希腊外交部在7月31日复照保加利亚政府，宣称它不能接受这项建议，借口是，两国都在联合国宪章上签过字，而根据联合国宪章的规定，所有签字国已经宣布不以战争作为解决争端的手段。
    保加利亚政府在8月7日的照会中强调指出，虽然存在着联合国宪章，但是希腊却正在变成北大西洋公约组织侵略集团的军事战略基地，北大西洋公约组织的许多成员国无视联合国宪章，毫无根据地对其他国家，如对埃及、黎巴嫩和约旦等国发动军事侵略。保加利亚政府希望希腊政府重新考虑保加利亚的建议。
