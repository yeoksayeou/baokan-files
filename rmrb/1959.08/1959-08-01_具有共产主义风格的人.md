    The model deeds of Valya Gaganova, a Soviet advanced textile worker, who disregarded personal gains and losses, sacrificed her personal interests, and helped backward work teams reach the level of advanced work teams, have spread throughout the Soviet Union. A nationwide upsurge in learning from Gaganova has been launched in the Soviet Union.

    Gaganova's creative actions have been praised by the Soviet Party and government. At present, the movement to learn from Gaganova has spread to the fifteen Soviet republics and has achieved remarkable results.

    The following photos are all taken by Soviet photographer Boltel, TASS report (Xinhua News Agency) (with pictures)
