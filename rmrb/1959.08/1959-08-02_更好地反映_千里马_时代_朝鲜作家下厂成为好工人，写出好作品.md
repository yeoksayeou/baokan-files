    Better Reflecting the "Chollima" Era
    Korean Writers Go to Factories to Become Good Workers and Write Good Works
    (People's Daily, Pyongyang, August 1st, Correspondent Wang Yuzhang) Korean writers, in order to arm themselves with the ideology of the working class and better reflect the current "Chollima" era, have gone to factories and villages to directly participate in labor and delve into life.
    Korean writers have always attached importance to going deep among the working people. Since the "Chollima" Movement was launched in Korea last year, in response to the call of the Korean Workers' Party, about sixty writers have gone to various labor fronts as ordinary workers and farmers, participating in labor and life, and have already achieved good results.
    Currently, the famous poet Baek In-jun is working as a driller at the Guseong Mining Machinery Factory. Writer Byun Hee-geun, who works as a mechanical repairman at the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, was recently awarded the title of "Model Worker" upon recommendation by the workers. He has mastered labor production techniques and shares food, lodging, and clothing with the workers, completely merging with them in thought and emotion. The famous writer Namgung-man, after working as a miner for several months, wrote that the workers' perseverance and optimism in labor are worthy of our good study.
    After participating in labor, the writers felt that their creative path was infinitely broad. The reporter met a young writer, Kim Young-cheol, at the Songnam Youth Coal Mine, who had been working there as a miner for a year. He is now a fourth-grade tunneling worker and has become a work team leader, developing a new coal mine together with more than 700 young socialist builders who voluntarily came here from various parts of northern Korea. He said, "The dedication shown by the youth in building socialism has deeply moved me. Now I understand them even more deeply." He said, "In the year I have been here, I have already written a play and completed a draft of a long poem and a collection of poems." Kim Young-cheol said, "I feel honored and proud to be with these young people, and I want to depict their glorious image and make it my lifelong career."

    更好地反映“千里马”时代
    朝鲜作家下厂成为好工人，写出好作品
    本报平壤1日电　记者王玉章报道：朝鲜作家为了以工人阶级的思想武装自己，更好地反映当前的“千里马”时代，纷纷下厂下乡，直接参加劳动，深入生活。
    朝鲜的作家向来重视深入到劳动人民中间去。自从去年朝鲜展开“千里马”运动以后，响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，约有六十名作家以普通工人、农民的身份，到各个劳动战线上去，参加了劳动生活，并且已经得到了很好的收获。
    现在，有名的诗人白仁俊在龟城矿山机械厂当钻工。在兴南肥料工厂当机械修理工的作家边熙根，不久前由工人推荐荣获“模范工人”的称号。他掌握了劳动生产技术，并同工人同吃、同住和穿一样的衣服，在思想感情上完全溶成了一片。有名的作家南宫满当了几个月的矿工以后，写文章说：工人们在劳动中坚韧不拔和乐观主义的精神，是值得我们很好的学习的。
    作家们参加劳动后，感到自己的创作道路无限广阔。记者在青年松南煤矿遇见了一位已在这里当了一年矿工的青年作家金永哲。他现在已是四级掘进工，并当了作业班长，他同由朝鲜北部各地自愿来到这里的七百多名青年社会主义建设者一道，开发一座新的煤矿。他说：“青年为了建设社会主义而表现出来的献身精神，使我十分感动。现在我才更深的了解了他们。”他说：“我来到这里的一年当中，已经写了一个剧本，并写成了一首长诗和一部诗集的草稿。”金永哲说：“同这些青年们在一起，我感到光荣和骄傲，我要把他们的光辉形象描写出来，并且作为我一生的事业。”
