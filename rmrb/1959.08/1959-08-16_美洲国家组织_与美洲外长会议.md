    "Organization of American States" and the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers

        Spearhead Pointing at Cuba
    The meeting of American Foreign Ministers, attended by the United States and twenty Latin American countries, is currently being held in Santiago, the capital of Chile.
    The Meeting of American Foreign Ministers is the "Organization of American States'" body for so-called "considering urgent issues and actions," with no fixed duration. This time, American imperialism, unable to wait for the Eleventh Inter-American Conference scheduled for next spring, is eagerly plotting to convene the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, which has not been held for eight years, under the pretext of the tense situation in the Caribbean region. Its purpose is to prepare conditions for further intervention in Cuba, to obstruct and undermine the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and to suppress the national democratic movements of the people of Latin American countries.
    The victory of the Cuban People's Revolution has caused a tremendous response among the people of Latin American countries, who have long been under the control and enslavement of American imperialism. Since the beginning of this year, the anti-American patriotic sentiment of the people of Latin American countries has grown unprecedentedly, and the struggle against American interference and control, to defend national resources, and against traitorous dictatorial regimes has risen one after another, wave after wave. Especially in the Caribbean region, the continued development and implementation of land reform in the Cuban People's Revolution, as well as the anti-dictatorial armed struggles waged by the people of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, have formed a new revolutionary wave, heavily impacting the rule of American imperialism and its agents in Latin America.
    For a long time, American imperialism, which has regarded Latin America as its own "backyard" and acted arbitrarily there, how could it willingly allow the national democratic movement there to develop on such a scale without obstruction and destruction! Of course, it hates Cuba, which is close at hand and insists on following the path of national independence and democracy, to the bone. Therefore, from the day of the victory of the Cuban Revolution, American imperialism has been racking its brains and doing everything possible to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities. It has exhausted economic threats, military intimidation, subversion and sabotage, instigation and alienation, armed rebellion, and even instructed special agents to assassinate Cuban revolutionary leaders and other despicable and shameless means, attempting to achieve the goal of overthrowing the Cuban revolutionary government.
    In April and May of this year, the US State Department successively convened meetings of US ambassadors to twelve countries in the Caribbean region and envoys to ten South American countries, planning to use the "Organization of American States" to take measures to "restore tranquility in the Caribbean Sea region." Shortly thereafter, the United States fabricated incidents of Cuba "invading" Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and other countries, falsely accusing Cuba of "interfering" in these countries, and used this as an excuse to convene a special meeting of American countries, organizing an "investigation committee" to conduct activities in some countries in Central America. This investigation activity failed due to the exposure by the Cuban government and the opposition of the people of Latin American countries. However, the Council of the "Organization of American States" convened this meeting of foreign ministers as a step to interfere in Cuba.
  Behind "Pan-American Cooperation"
    As is well known, the United States' use of the "Organization of American States" to interfere in Latin America did not begin today. Since the establishment of this organization, the United States has been using it to carry out economic plunder, political control, and military intervention in Latin American countries.
      "Pan-American cooperation" was originally an ideal of the Latin American people. As early as the early nineteenth century, in the process of opposing Spanish colonial rule and striving for national independence, Latin American countries demanded mutual solidarity and mutual support. Prominent Latin American figures who led the revolution against Spain, such as Miranda, Bolivar, and San Martin, all enthusiastically expressed their support for the Western Hemisphere cooperation movement.
    However, this ideal of the Latin American people was plagiarized, distorted, and used by American imperialists. At the end of the nineteenth century, the United States began to develop into an imperialist country and vigorously expanded into Latin America. For decades, under the slogan of "Pan-American unity," it issued orders to Latin American countries, plundered their wealth, and drove them to join aggressive military blocs. Since then, the term "Pan-Americanism" has become synonymous with the policy of American imperialism to invade and enslave Latin American countries.
    The "Organization of American States" was established in 1890 under the manipulation of American imperialism. Initially called the "International Bureau of American Republics", it was renamed the "Pan American Union" in 1910, and renamed the "Organization of American States" at the Ninth Inter-American Conference in Bogota in 1948 when the "Charter of the Organization of American States" was adopted. The headquarters of this institution is located in Washington, D.C., Americans account for the largest number of staff, and 70% of the funding is paid by the United States. For seventy years, it has been under the control of the United States, implementing US policies, and is actually the "colonial department" of the United States in Latin America.
    According to the charter, the highest body of the "Organization of American States" is the Inter-American Conference, which is held every five years. The next is the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers. Since its establishment, the "Organization of American States" has held ten Inter-American Conferences and a series of meetings of various kinds, including irregular meetings of foreign ministers. It can be said that most of the resolutions passed and conventions concluded at previous conferences have facilitated American aggression against Latin American countries. After World War II, the United States intensified its use of the "Organization of American States" as a tool for aggression against Latin America in politics, economy, and military affairs.
    When World War II was still in progress, the United States was already making arrangements to control the entire economy of Latin America. In March 1945, the Inter-American Conference held in Mexico passed the colonial plan proposed by US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton. This plan, known as the "Economic Charter of the Americas," under the guise of "free trade," "free investment," and "free enterprise," required Latin American countries to lower tariffs in order to dump American industrial products in these countries, destroying their national industries that had grown up during the war but were still fragile; facilitate the United States to import capital into Latin American countries according to its own conditions; prohibit Latin American countries from nationalizing basic resources and industries, and prohibit Latin American countries from controlling their own economic lifelines.
    American imperialism also used the "Organization of American States" to coerce Latin American countries into signing a series of military conventions and clauses. As early as the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers in 1942, the United States planned to establish the "Inter-American Defense Board." In September 1947, it forced the Latin American countries to pass the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" at the Rio de Janeiro Conference. This treaty stipulates that if an American country is "aggressed," joint action must be taken by all countries if two-thirds of the votes are passed. The treaty also stipulates a vast "security zone." In addition to the American continent, the "security zone" includes Greenland, Hawaii, and the US Pacific Islands. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it hastily convened a Meeting of American Foreign Ministers in Washington in March-April 1951, which passed the so-called "Washington Declaration" against the Soviet Union and communism and the "Collective Defense Case" aimed at facilitating American imperialism to collect cannon fodder in Latin America.
    For many years, the United States has also used the "Organization of American States" to support reactionary dictatorial regimes in Latin America, interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, and undermine the independent development of Latin American countries. At the Tenth Pan-American Conference held in March 1954, the United States, under the guise of "opposing the threat of international communism," forced Latin American countries to accept its proposed "Anti-Communist Declaration." This "declaration" stipulates that if any American country establishes a so-called "political system outside the continent," it will be "endangering the peace of the Americas," and other countries should jointly discuss countermeasures. Shortly after the passage of this "declaration," the United States personally organized a mercenary army led by Armas to attack Guatemala and overthrow the democratic government of Guatemala.
    However, the Latin American people, who have a tradition of struggle, are not so easily deceived. Although American imperialism regards itself as the master in the "Organization of American States," flaunts its power, and gesticulates, the American practice of using the "Organization of American States" to interfere in and control Latin American countries has always been strongly resisted by the people of Latin American countries. The people of Latin American countries launched a massive movement to prevent their governments from sending troops to participate in the American war of aggression against Korea. The United States tried its best, but could only collect one battalion of cannon fodder in Colombia. At the Inter-American Conference in 1954, where the United States plotted to interfere in Guatemala, the United States exerted tremendous pressure to barely pass the "Anti-Communist Declaration." Due to the protests and struggles of the people of Latin American countries, the representatives of the participating countries raised more than 40 amendments to the US proposal. Although the proposal was passed, the United States' attempt to interfere in Guatemala with "joint action" still failed. In the end, it had to personally organize a mercenary army to overthrow the democratic government of Guatemala.
      Prospects for the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers
    Today, the United States is once again attempting to create a replica of the Guatemalan incident under the guise of "non-interference," "collective security," "representative democracy," and "cooperation to strive for economic and social progress" through the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, in order to put on a "legal" cloak for further interference in Cuba and to seek the "cooperation" of other Latin American countries. But 1959 is different from 1954. Under the general trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the people of Latin American countries have greatly awakened, and they are increasingly clearly aware of the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism. They know that the so-called "tense situation in the Caribbean region" discussed at this Meeting of Foreign Ministers is entirely deliberately created by the United States and is caused by the United States' interference in Cuba and support for dictatorial regimes in the region. The so-called "effective implementation of representative democracy and respect for human rights" is just an excuse for interference that the United States has picked up from the garbage heap of the "Organization of American States" in order to target Cuba's elections and punishment of counter-revolutionaries, and to target the anti-dictatorial armed struggles of the people of the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
    In order to support Cuba and oppose American interference in Cuba, the people of Latin American countries have launched a massive and unprecedented movement. They hold rallies, establish committees to support the Cuban Revolution, and carry out activities for the "Week of Supporting the Cuban People." In addition to the Communist Party, the Christian Democratic Party of Chile and the Socialist Party of Argentina, as well as the People's Party of Mexico and Peru, have also condemned the conspiracy of American imperialism and expressed their support for Cuba. The congresses of Venezuela, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and other countries have all passed resolutions supporting Cuba and opposing American interference.
    Cuban President Dorticós has firmly expressed his opposition to any actions by the Meeting of Foreign Ministers to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. The entire Cuban people, under the leadership of Castro, are fighting to defend the revolution and oppose interference. On the eve of the opening of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers, the Cuban government, with the assistance of the people, uncovered a large-scale armed subversion conspiracy planned by American imperialism and coordinated with the interference activities of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism.
    At the Meeting of Foreign Ministers on the 13th, US Secretary of State Herter formally proposed that the meeting issue a declaration; establish a "special temporary committee"; strengthen the "Inter-American Peace Committee"; and establish a committee "with the right" to collect intelligence in various countries and specifically supervise the implementation of "democracy," in order to serve its further interference in the internal affairs of Cuba and Latin American countries. The Foreign Minister of the Dominican dictatorial government, like an echo bug of the United States, repeated slanderous accusations against Cuba at the meeting. Cuban Foreign Minister Roa has firmly opposed Herter's proposal to establish a committee to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries at the meeting and gave the Dominican Foreign Minister the deserved counterattack. The Meeting of American Foreign Ministers is experiencing a sharp struggle between interference and anti-interference, and whether inside or outside the meeting, it shows that the United States' policy of using the "Organization of American States" to promote its aggression and interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries has encountered unprecedented difficulties.
    Of course, the possibility exists that the United States will use the wavering nature of some Latin American governments, threaten and lure them, and exert pressure on them, thereby forcing the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers to pass the American proposal. But this approach of American imperialism will inevitably arouse even stronger resistance from the people of Latin American countries. If the United States thinks that it can do whatever it wants by stealing the name of some resolution of the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, it is greatly mistaken.
    Today, we are in an era of thriving socialism and national independence movements. The aggressive policies of American imperialism are constantly suffering shameful defeats around the world. It has also become an unstoppable trend in the historical development of the people of Latin American countries to get rid of the control of American imperialism and achieve complete independence. The conspiracy of American imperialism to interfere in Cuba and suppress the national democratic movements of the people of Latin American countries is bound to fail.

    “美洲国家组织”与美洲外长会议
    梅尔
        矛头指向古巴
    有美国和二十个拉丁美洲国家参加的美洲外长会议，这几天正在智利首都圣地亚哥举行。
    美洲外长会议是“美洲国家组织”所谓“考虑紧急问题与行动”的机构，会期不定。这一次，美帝国主义等不到预定在明年开春举行的第十一届美洲国家会议，借口加勒比地区的紧张局势，急于策划召开已经有八年没有举行了的美洲外长会议，其目的，就是要为进一步干涉古巴，阻挠和破坏尼加拉瓜和多米尼加人民的反独裁斗争，镇压拉丁美洲各国人民的民族民主运动准备条件。
    古巴人民革命的胜利，在长期处于美帝国主义控制和奴役下的拉丁美洲各国人民中引起了巨大的反响。今年以来，拉丁美洲各国人民的反美爱国情绪空前增长，反对美国干涉和控制、保卫民族资源和反对卖国独裁政权的斗争，彼伏此起，一浪高过一浪。尤其是在加勒比地区，古巴人民革命的继续发展和土地改革的实施，以及尼加拉瓜和多米尼加人民所进行的反独裁武装斗争，形成了一个新的革命浪潮，沉重地冲击着美帝国主义和它的代理人在拉丁美洲的统治。
    很久以来，一直把拉丁美洲看作自己的
  “后院”，并在那里为所欲为的美帝国主义，怎么会甘心让那里的民族民主运动如此规模的发展而不加阻挠和破坏呢！对于近在咫尺、坚持沿着民族独立和民主的道路前进的古巴，当然更是恨之入骨了。所以，从古巴革命胜利的那一天起，美帝国主义就处心积虑，千方百计地进行各种阴谋破坏活动。它用尽了经济威胁、军事恫吓、颠复破坏、挑拨离间、武装叛乱、甚至指使特务谋杀古巴革命领导人等等卑鄙无耻的手段，妄图达到推翻古巴革命政府的目的。
    今年4、5月间，美国国务院先后召开了美国驻加勒比地区十二国大使会议和驻南美十国使节会议，策划利用“美洲国家组织”采取措施来“恢复加勒比海地区的平静”。此后不久，美国就制造所谓古巴“入侵”巴拿马、尼加拉瓜、危地马拉等国的事件，诬告古巴“干涉”这些国家，并借此召开美洲国家特别会议，组织“调查委员会”，到中美洲的一些国家去活动。这次调查活动，因为古巴政府的揭露和拉丁美洲各国人民的反对而破产了。但是“美洲国家组织”理事会会议召开这次外长会议作为干涉古巴的一个步骤。
  在“泛美合作”的背后
    众所周知，美国利用“美洲国家组织”对拉丁美洲进行干涉并非始自今日。自从这个组织成立以来，美国就一直利用它来对拉丁美洲各国进行经济掠夺、政治控制和军事干涉。
      “泛美合作”本来是拉丁美洲人民的一个理想。远在十九世纪初叶，拉丁美洲各国在反对西班牙殖民统治、争取民族独立的过程中，就要求相互团结和彼此支援。领导反对西班牙的革命的拉丁美洲著名人士，例如米兰达、波利瓦尔、圣马丁等人，都曾热烈表示支持西半球的合作运动。
    但是，拉丁美洲人民的这种理想为美帝国主义者所剽窃、歪曲和利用。十九世纪末，美国开始发展成为帝国主义国家，就极力向拉丁美洲扩展。几十年来，它在“泛美团结”的口号下，对拉丁美洲各国发号施令，掠夺它们的财富，驱使它们加入侵略性的军事集团。从此，“泛美主义”这个名词就成了美帝国主义侵略和奴役拉丁美洲各国的政策的同义字。
    “美洲国家组织”就是在美帝国主义一手操纵下，于1890年成立的。最初称为“美洲各国商务局”，1910年改称“泛美联盟”，1948年波哥大第九届美洲国家会议上通过“美洲国家组织宪章”，改名为“美洲国家组织”。这个机构的总部设在华盛顿，工作人员中美国人占最大多数，70％的经费由美国支付。七十年来，它一直在美国的控制之下，执行美国的政策，实际是美国的拉丁美洲“殖民部”。
    按照宪章规定，“美洲国家组织”的最高机构是美洲国家会议，每五年召开一次。其次是美洲国家外长会议。“美洲国家组织”成立以来先后举行过十次美洲国家会议和一系列各种名目的会议，包括不定期的外长会议在内。历届会议上通过的决议和订立的公约，可以说绝大部分都是便于美国对拉丁美洲国家的侵略的。第二次世界大战以后，美国更是加紧利用“美洲国家组织”作为在政治、经济和军事等各方面侵略拉丁美洲的工具。
    当第二次世界大战还在进行的时候，美国就在为控制拉丁美洲全部经济作安排了。1945年3月，美洲各国在墨西哥举行的会议，通过了美国助理国务卿克莱顿所提出的殖民计划。这个被称为“美洲经济宪章”的计划，在“自由贸易”、“自由投资”和“自由企业”的幌子下，要求拉丁美洲国家降低关税以便向这些国家倾销美国的工业品，摧毁它在战时成长起来但依然脆弱的民族工业；便利美国根据自己的条件把资本输入拉丁美洲各国；不许拉丁美洲国家把基本资源和工业收归国有，不许拉丁美洲各国掌握自己的经济命脉。
    美帝国主义还利用“美洲国家组织”胁迫拉丁美洲国家签订了一系列军事性的公约和条款。早在1942年的美洲国家外长会议上，美国就策划设立了“美洲防务委员会”。1947年9月迫使拉丁美洲国家里约热内卢会议通过了“美洲联防公约”。这项条约规定：如有一个美洲国家遭到“侵略”时，经三分之二的多数票通过各国就要采取联合行动。条约还规定了地域广大的“安全区”。除美洲大陆外，“安全区”包括格林兰、夏威夷和美属太平洋诸岛在内。美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争之后，急忙在1951年3—4月在华盛顿召开了一次美洲外长会议，会议通过了反苏反共的所谓“华盛顿宣言”和旨在便利美帝国主义在拉丁美洲搜罗炮灰的
  “集体防御案”。
    多年来，美国还利用“美洲国家组织”在拉丁美洲扶植反动独裁政权，干涉各国内政和破坏拉丁美洲国家独立自主的发展。1954年3月举行的第十届泛美会议上，美国在所谓“反对国际共产主义威胁”的幌子下，迫使拉丁美洲国家接受了它提出的“反共宣言。”这个“宣言”规定，如果有任何一个美洲国家建立了所谓“大陆以外的政治制度”，就是“危害美洲和平”，其他国家就应该共商对策。这一“宣言”通过后不久，美国就亲自组织以阿马斯为首的雇佣军进攻危地马拉，推翻了危地马拉民主政府。
    但是，具有斗争传统的拉丁美洲人民不是那末容易被蒙蔽和欺骗的。尽管美帝国主义在“美洲国家组织”中以主子自居，飞扬拔扈，指手划脚，而美国利用“美洲国家组织”干涉和控制拉丁美洲国家的作法则历来都遭到拉丁美洲各国人民强烈的反抗。拉丁美洲各国人民曾掀起了一个声势浩大的运动，阻止了各国政府派兵参加美国侵朝战争，美国费尽心机，也只能在哥伦比亚一个国家内搜罗到一个营的炮灰。在1954年美国策划干涉危地马拉的那次美洲国家会议上，美国施加了巨大的压力才使“反共宣言”得以勉强通过。由于拉丁美洲各国人民的抗议和斗争，与会各国代表对美国提案提了四十多条修正意见。提案虽然通过了，但美国企图以“联合行动”干涉危地马拉的阴谋还是未能得逞，最后只有亲自出马组织雇佣军来推翻危地马拉的民主政府。
      美洲外长会议展望
    今天，美国又一次在“不干涉”、“集体安全”、“代议制民主”、“争取经济和社会进步而进行合作”等等幌子下，妄图通过美洲外长会议，制造危地马拉事件的翻版，为进一步干涉古巴披上“合法”的外衣，争取其他拉丁美洲国家的“合作”。但是1959年已经不同于1954年，在东风压倒西风的总形势下，拉丁美洲各国人民已经大大地觉醒起来，他们越来越清楚地认识到美帝国主义的侵略野心。他们知道这次外长会议讨论的所谓“加勒比地区紧张局势”完全是美国蓄意制造的，是美国干涉古巴和支持这个地区的独裁政权所造成的。所谓“代议制民主的有效实施和尊重人权”，只是美国为了针对古巴的选举和惩治反革命分子，针对多米尼加和尼加拉瓜人民的反独裁武装斗争，而在“美洲国家组织”的垃圾堆里所拣出来的干涉借口而已。
    为了声援古巴和反对美国干涉古巴，拉丁美洲各国人民已经展开了一个声势浩大、规模空前的运动。他们举行集会，成立支持古巴革命的委员会，开展“支援古巴人民周”的活动。除了共产党之外，智利的基督教民主党和阿根廷的社会党，墨西哥和秘鲁的人民党也都谴责美帝国主义的阴谋和表示对古巴的支持。委内瑞拉、萨尔瓦多、哥斯达黎加、乌拉圭等国的国会都曾通过决议支持古巴和反对美国的干涉活动。
    古巴总统多尔蒂科斯已经坚决表示了反对外长会议任何干涉古巴内政的作法。古巴全国人民正在卡斯特罗的领导下为保卫革命、反对干涉而斗争中。外长会议开幕前夕，古巴政府在人民的协助下，破获了一起由美帝国主义策划、与外长会议的干涉活动相配合的大规模的武装颠复阴谋。这是对美帝国主义的一个沉重的打击。
    在13日的外长会议上，美国国务卿赫脱正式提出要会议发表一项宣言；设立一个“特别临时委员会”；加强“美洲国家和平委员会”；以及建立一个“有权”到各国搜集情报、专门监督实施“民主”的委员会，来为它进一步干涉古巴和拉丁美洲国家的内政服务。多米尼加独裁政府的外长像美国应声虫一样地在会上重弹诬蔑古巴的谰调。古巴外长罗亚已经在会上坚决反对赫脱成立委员会干涉各国内政的主张，并且给了多米尼加外长以应有的反击。美洲外长会议正在经历着一场尖锐的干涉和反干涉的斗争，而不管是会内或者会外，都表明美国利用“美洲国家组织”来推行它的侵略和干涉拉丁美洲国家内政的政策已经遇到了前所未有的困难。
    当然，美国利用某些拉丁美洲国家政府的动摇性，对它们进行威胁利诱和施加压力，从而迫使美洲外长会议通过美国建议的可能性是存在的。但是美帝国主义的这种做法，必将激起拉丁美洲各国人民更加强烈的反抗。假使美国以为盗用了美洲外长会议什么什么决议的名义就能为所欲为那就大错特错了。
    今天我们所处的时代是社会主义和民族独立运动欣欣向荣的时代。美帝国主义的侵略政策不断地在全世界范围内遭到可耻的失败。拉丁美洲各国人民摆脱美帝国主义的控制和取得完全独立也已成为历史发展的不可阻挡的趋势。美帝国主义干涉古巴，镇压拉丁美洲各国人民民族民主运动的阴谋是必然要失败的。
