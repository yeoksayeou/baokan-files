Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 2nd: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held its eighth pastoral area work conference from July 6th to 24th, determining the guidelines and tasks for developing animal husbandry production in 1960.

This conference summarized the experiences of the autonomous region in achieving a comprehensive leap forward in animal husbandry production and various tasks in pastoral areas since 1958.

The conference pointed out that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the pastoral areas have realized people's communeization since the second half of 1958, and the socialist construction in pastoral areas has entered a new stage. A new situation of great leap forward has emerged in animal husbandry production and various construction undertakings in pastoral areas. In the 1959 fiscal year (from July 1958 to June 1959), the region increased by 7.65 million head of various young livestock such as cattle, horses, and sheep, an increase of 2.15 million head compared with the 1958 fiscal year; pig production increased by 5% compared with the same period last year, and various poultry developed to more than 9 million.

In 1949, the total number of livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was only 9.4 million. By the end of March last year, it had developed to 24.47 million. The average annual net increase was 1.67 million head in nine years. However, the net increase in the 1959 fiscal year was more than twice the average net increase in the past nine years. The quality of livestock in the autonomous region has also greatly improved. In the first half of this year, 2.16 million purebred and first- and second-generation improved lambs survived throughout the region, equivalent to 6.2 times the total number of sheep improved in the past seven years. At present, there are 2.68 million improved breeds of sheep in the region. In terms of agriculture, livestock product processing, diversified operations, settlement construction, and other basic construction work in pastoral areas, there has also been rapid development. This rate of development in animal husbandry production is unprecedented in the history of animal husbandry production in Inner Mongolia.

The conference believes that the autonomous region's ability to achieve such great achievements in animal husbandry production is due to the following reasons:

In the sparsely populated grasslands, the establishment of people's communes in pastoral areas has created extremely favorable conditions for the unified management of livestock, further improving feeding management, vigorously carrying out basic construction in pastoral areas, changing the single animal husbandry economy into an economy that is dominated by animal husbandry and comprehensively develops industry, agriculture, forestry, etc., rationally using pastures, and accelerating the realization of settled grazing.

The correct implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the victory in the struggle between the two roads, two lines, and two work styles have greatly improved the socialist consciousness of cadres and herdsmen, further strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road, and made the relationship between the Party and the masses closer. After thoroughly criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas such as "pastoral areas are backward," "pastures are saturated," "natural disasters are insurmountable," and "pastoral areas have few people and cannot develop a large number of livestock in the future," the leadership level of pastoral area work has been improved, and the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly encouraged.

The conference believes that the comprehensive implementation of the eight basic measures for increasing and protecting livestock, namely "water, grass, breeding, improvement, management, prevention, housing, and tools" (developing water conservancy, solving feed and fodder problems, improving the breeding rate and survival rate, improving breeds, improving feeding management, preventing livestock diseases and preventing disasters such as wolf disasters, animal and rodent pests, building sheds and pens, and reforming tools), as well as herdsmen using vegetables, fresh eggs, and poultry to replace part of their meat consumption, is the direct cause of the unprecedented increase in the autonomous region's livestock breeding rate and survival rate this year, as well as the reduction in livestock consumption. In order to strive for a great harvest in animal husbandry, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region vigorously cultivated "high-yield groups" and "experimental groups," and widely adopted technical measures such as mating immediately after delivery, two litters a year, three litters in two years, or artificial insemination and injection of pregnant mare serum, to achieve full pregnancy of female animals and multiple births of twin and multiple lambs. In lambing and rearing, all localities further carried out the socialist labor competition of "give birth to one, keep one alive, keep one alive, and make one strong." According to the principle of increasing the number of livestock and improving the quality of livestock at the same time, herdsmen also actively improved livestock breeds. This has created a new situation of "three highs and one more" in animal husbandry production in the autonomous region, namely, high female animal breeding rate, high female animal twin lamb rate, high lamb survival rate, and more improved young livestock.

In organizing animal husbandry production, the autonomous region strengthened the Party's leadership over animal husbandry production and implemented the Party's mass line. Focusing on the masses' thinking, breeding and reproduction, wintering and livestock protection, livestock disease prevention and control, and increasing production and practicing economy, a livestock industry front was established from top to bottom. According to the central tasks of each period, battles were divided and mass movements were launched, so that the production and work in pastoral areas developed wave after wave.

Based on the principle of exerting full effort, emphasizing both quantity and quality, and comprehensive development, this conference formulated specific guidelines and tasks for developing animal husbandry production in the next year, namely 1960. This guideline is to continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, carry out mass movements, consolidate the people's communes, implement the eight measures for animal husbandry, and develop animal husbandry production steadily, comprehensively, and at a high speed.

Stability, comprehensiveness, and high speed are an inseparable unity. To develop animal husbandry at a high speed, production must be stable, and development must be comprehensive. The so-called stable production means to correctly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, vigorously carry out basic construction in pastoral areas, so that animal husbandry has a solid ideological and material foundation for complete and stable development, and completely gets rid of the unstable state. The so-called comprehensive development means that not only pastoral areas should vigorously develop animal husbandry, but also agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas should vigorously develop animal husbandry; not only should large livestock be vigorously developed, but also small livestock should be developed. Only with the stable and comprehensive development of animal husbandry can there be high speed. The high speed of animal husbandry includes both the quantity and quality of livestock. To maintain the high-speed development of quantity, first, it is necessary to increase the breeding rate and reduce the mortality rate; second, it is necessary to maintain a certain net increase rate; and third, it is necessary to implement planned consumption and planned production. Improving the quality of livestock should include three aspects: first, the breed is excellent; second, increase the breeding rate of large livestock to increase large livestock at a higher speed; third, increase the output of livestock products.

Participants in this conference included the secretaries of the league and banner party committees, agricultural and pastoral ministers, commune party secretaries, and production team leaders of the autonomous region.

    内蒙古认真贯彻党的政策　全面执行牧业八项增产措施
    一年增殖牛马羊七百多万头
    据新华社呼和浩特2日电　内蒙古自治区从7月6日到24日举行了第八次牧区工作会议，确定了1960年发展畜牧业生产的方针和任务。
    这次会议总结了1958年以来自治区畜牧业生产和牧区各项工作实现全面大跃进的经验。
    会议指出，在党的社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年下半年以来，整个牧区已实现了人民公社化，牧区的社会主义建设事业进入了一个新的阶段，畜牧业生产和牧区各项建设事业出现了大跃进的新局面。1959年度（从1958年7月到1959年6月），全区增殖了牛马羊等各种仔畜七百六十五万头，比1958年度多增殖了二百一十五万头；生猪生产比去年同期增长5％，各种家禽发展到九百多万只。
    在1949年，内蒙古自治区牲畜总头数只有九百四十万头。到去年3月底，发展到二千四百四十七万头。九年间每年平均净增一百六十七万头。而1959年度的净增数，却比过去九年间平均净增数提高了一倍多。自治区牲畜质量也有了很大提高。今年上半年，全区成活的纯种和第一、二代改良羊羔二百一十六万只，相当于过去七年改良出来的羊只总数的六点二倍。现在，全区已有各种良种绵羊二百六十八万只。在牧区的农业、畜产品加工、多种经营、定居地建设和其他基本建设工作方面，也都有了迅速的发展。畜牧业生产的这种发展速度在内蒙古畜牧业生产史上是空前的。
    会议认为：自治区畜牧业生产能够取得这样大的成就，是由于以下的一些原因：
    在地广人稀的草原上，牧区人民公社的建立，为牲畜的统一经营，进一步改善饲养管理，大搞牧区基本建设，改变单一的畜牧业经济为以牧为主、工农林等业全面发展的经济，合理使用牧场和加速实现定居游牧等等，创造了极为有利的条件。
    党的社会主义建设总路线的正确贯彻执行及两条道路、两条路线、两种作风的斗争的胜利，使干部和牧民群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高了一步，进一步坚定了走社会主义道路的信心，使党和群众的联系更加密切。在彻底批判了“牧区落后论”、“牧场饱和论”、“自然灾害不可战胜论”、以及“牧区人少今后不能大量发展牲畜”等等右倾保守思想以后，牧区工作的领导水平提高了，群众的干劲受到极大鼓舞。
    会议认为，全面贯彻“水、草、繁、改、管、防、舍、工”（发展水利、解决饲草饲料、提高繁殖率和成活率、改良品种、改善饲养管理、防治牲畜疫病和防止狼灾兽鼠害等灾害，盖棚搭圈建立厩舍、工具改革）八项增畜保畜基本措施，以及牧民用蔬菜、鲜蛋、家禽代替一部分肉食，是自治区今年牲畜的增殖率、保育率空前提高和牲畜消耗减少的直接原因。自治区各族农牧民，为了争取畜牧业大丰收，大力培殖“丰产群”、“试验群”，广泛采取随产随配的一年两产、两年三产或实行人工受精、妊娠马血清注射等技术措施，实现母畜满怀和一胎双羔多羔。在接羔保育中，各地进一步开展了“生一只、活一只，活一只、壮一只”的社会主义劳动竞赛。根据增加牲畜数量与提高牲畜质量同时并举的方针，牧民们还积极改良牲畜品种。这就使自治区的畜牧业生产出现了母畜繁殖率高、母畜双羔率高、仔畜成活率高及改良幼畜多等“三高一多”的新情况。
    自治区在组织畜牧业生产中，加强了党对畜牧业生产的领导，贯彻执行党的群众路线。抓住群众思想、配种繁殖、过冬保畜、畜疫防治和增产节约等中心，自上而下建立一条畜牧业战线，根据各个时期的中心任务，划分战役，开展群众运动，使牧区的生产和工作一浪推一浪地向前发展。
    这次会议根据鼓足干劲、数量质量并重和全面发展的方针，制订了下一年即1960年度发展畜牧业生产的具体方针和任务。这个方针就是：继续加强党的领导，开展群众运动，巩固人民公社，贯彻执行牧业八项措施，稳定地、全面地、高速度地发展畜牧业生产。
    稳定、全面、高速度是不可分离的统一体。要高速度发展畜牧业，必须生产稳定，必须全面发展。所谓生产稳定，就是要正确贯彻执行党的方针政策，大力进行牧区基本建设，使畜牧业具备完全稳定发展的巩固的思想基础和物质基础，完全摆脱不稳定的状态。所谓全面发展就是，不仅牧业区要大力发展畜牧业，农区半农半牧区也要大力发展畜牧业；不仅要大力发展大牲畜，而且要发展小牲畜。畜牧业有了稳定地全面地发展，才会有高速度。畜牧业的高速度，包括牲畜的数量和质量两个方面。要保持数量的高速度发展，第一，必须提高增殖率，减少死亡率；第二，必须保持一定的纯增率；第三，必须实行计划消费，计划生产。提高牲畜质量应该包括三个方面：一是品种优良；一是提高大畜的繁殖率，以更高的速度增加大牲畜；一是提高畜产品的产量。
    参加这次会议的有自治区的各盟、旗党委书记、农牧部长、人民公社党委书记和生产队长等。
