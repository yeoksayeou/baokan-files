Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: In the first half of this year, rural areas across the country have made appropriate arrangements for the production and life of families of martyrs and military personnel, ensuring that their living standards are not lower than those of the general public.

People's communes in various places have appropriately assigned work to laborers, semi-laborers, and auxiliary laborers among the families of martyrs and military personnel, enabling them to increase their income as much as possible. For example, in Kengyuan People's Commune in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, the semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers in the eighty-eight households of families of martyrs and military personnel have been well arranged. Chen Shunlian, a military dependent in her forties, was assigned to raise sows by the production team, earning more than 700 work points each year. Zhuang Weiyi, a disabled soldier who had a serious leg injury, was arranged to work as a salesperson in the supply and marketing cooperative, and his monthly income is enough to cover the family's expenses. Xiangshan People's Commune in Wuwei County, Anhui Province, assigned families of martyrs and military personnel with weak labor and disabled soldiers to be feeders, canteen managers, nursery staff, or to participate in various sideline productions. In the Nalie Production Brigade of Zhonghe People's Commune in Donglan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in addition to properly arranging for families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in community labor, they are also organized to do a good job in household sideline production. Seventeen households of families of martyrs and military personnel in the whole team have now raised eleven pigs and more than one hundred chickens.

Some families of martyrs and military personnel have no labor force or a very weak labor force. Although they participate in production, their income is less than that of the general public. The people's communes give this part of the families of martyrs and military personnel additional subsidies for labor days or preferential treatment in the form of allowances, so that the lives of military families are not lower than the level of the general public, and the living standards of the families of martyrs are slightly higher than those of the general public. At present, more than half of the communes in Shanxi, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Hebei and other provinces have completed the evaluation of the number of labor days or wages to be subsidized to the families of martyrs and military personnel in the first half of the year, and the evaluation work will be completed soon. Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions with slower progress are actively evaluating. The people's communes that have completed the evaluation work, in conjunction with the summer harvest distribution, have distributed some of the preferential grain and funds to the families of martyrs and military personnel. According to statistics from thirteen cities and counties in Datong, Hequ, Heshun, Yuncheng and other places in Shanxi Province, the average income of the families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled soldiers enjoying preferential treatment is slightly higher than that of ordinary commune members.

Local governments also provide living allowances to families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled soldiers who still have special difficulties in life after enjoying the preferential treatment of the people's communes, or who encounter temporary difficulties. According to statistics from fifty-seven counties and cities in Shandong Province, from January to May, a total of more than 936,000 yuan of living allowances were issued to families of martyrs and military personnel. The districts and counties in the suburbs of Beijing have successively allocated more than 193,000 yuan to families of martyrs and military personnel in difficulty.

In many places, preferential treatment groups have been organized to serve the elderly, sick, or disabled among the families of martyrs and military personnel who have no one to take care of them at home. In Dongtang Township, Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, each work area is composed of cadres and outstanding commune members to form a preferential treatment group, often repairing houses for families of martyrs and military personnel, taking care of patients, or carrying water and firewood. In Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, more than 250 women's preferential treatment groups, which have persisted for more than ten years, have sewn and washed more than 8,500 pieces of clothing for the families of martyrs and military personnel in the first half of the year. For the elderly and widowed households among the families of martyrs, in addition to giving them preferential treatment in the community's homes for the elderly and giving them more favorable treatment than ordinary elderly people, special homes for the elderly of martyrs have also been established in areas with a large number of families of martyrs. There are more than 1,900 elderly people in the homes for the elderly of martyrs in counties and cities in Hebei Province. In Jiangxi Province, only thirty-five counties in the old revolutionary base areas have established seventy-four homes for the elderly of glory, and there are more than 2,200 elderly martyrs and veteran revolutionary comrades in the homes.

At present, in the work of giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and military personnel in some rural areas, there are still phenomena of not grasping tightly, not being meticulous enough, and even neglecting it. All localities are conducting an inspection of the preferential treatment work in conjunction with the celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day, so as to further improve the work of giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and military personnel in rural areas.

    分配适当工作　发放补助费用　组织优抚慰问
    广大烈军属得到妥善安排
    新华社31日讯　今年上半年，全国各地农村对烈属、军属的生产和生活作了妥善的安排，保证他们的生活水平不低于一般群众。
    各地人民公社对烈属、军属中的劳动力、半劳动力和辅助劳动力，都适当的分配了工作，使他们能尽可能地增加收入。例如，福建省连江县坑园人民公社八十八户烈属、军属中的半劳动力和辅助劳动力都得到了很好的安排。四十多岁的军属陈顺莲，生产队分配她养母猪，每年可得七百多个工分。左脚曾经负重伤的残废军人庄维义，被安排在供销社作售货员，每月收入够全家开支。安徽省无为县响山人民公社分配劳动力弱的烈属、军属和残废军人当饲养员、食堂管理员、保育员或参加各种副业生产。广西僮族自治区东兰县中和人民公社那烈生产大队，除妥善安排烈属、军属参加社内劳动外，并组织他们搞好家庭副业生产，全队十七户烈属、军属，现在已养猪十一头、鸡一百多只。
    有些烈属、军属没有劳动力或劳动力很弱，他们虽然参加了生产，但收入要比一般群众少。人民公社对这一部分烈属、军属就另外给予补贴劳动日或发放优待金的优待，使军属的生活不低于一般群众的水平，烈属的生活水平稍高于一般群众。目前，山西、安徽、湖北、河南、河北等省半数以上的公社已将上半年应给烈属、军属补贴的劳动日数或工资数评议完毕，全部评议工作即将结束。一些进度较缓的省、市、自治区正在积极评议中。结束评议工作的人民公社，结合夏收分配，已将一部分优待粮、款分配给烈属、军属。据山西省大同、河曲、和顺、运城等十三个市、县的统计，享受优待的烈属、军属和残废军人的平均收入，都要较一般社员稍高一些。
    在享受人民公社优待以后生活上仍有特殊困难的或临时发生困难的烈属、军属和残废军人，当地政府还发给生活补助费。据山东省五十七个县、市的统计，1月到5月共为烈属、军属发放了生活补助费九十三万六千多元。北京市郊各区、县已先后拨出十九万三千多元发给有困难的烈属、军属。
    对烈属、军属中家中无人照顾的老人或病人、残废者，许多地方都组织了优抚小组为他们服务。辽宁省凤城县东汤乡每个作业区都由干部和优秀社员组成优抚小组，经常为烈属、军属修理房屋、照顾病人或担水、打柴。山西省武乡县坚持了十多年的二百五十多个妇女优抚小组，上半年为烈属、军属缝洗衣服八千五百多件。对烈属中的孤老户，各地人民公社除优先吸收他们到公社的敬老院，并给他们较一般老人优厚的待遇外，在烈属较多的地区还专门举办了烈属养老院。河北省各县、市入烈属养老院的老人有一千九百多人。江西省仅革命老根据地的三十五个县，就办了光荣敬老院七十四个，入院的烈属老人和老革命同志有二千二百多人。
    目前，有的农村在优待烈属、军属的工作中，还存在着抓得不紧、做得不够细致、甚至忽视的现象。各地正结合庆祝“八一”建军节对优抚工作进行一次检查，使农村优待烈属、军属的工作更加提高一步。
