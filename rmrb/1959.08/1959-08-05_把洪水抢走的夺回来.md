Take Back What the Flood Took Away
Not fearing disaster, not discouraged, not disheartened, and with soaring energy, leading the fight against the flood, striving to reverse the crisis, and overcome the disaster—this is the heroic spirit shown by the Communist Party members and cadres of Gaodianzi Township. In that moment of crisis, they were selfless, sacrificing themselves for the collective, and risking their lives to rescue public property and the masses. Such noble actions are truly worthy of praise.

Look, there is Communist Party member Zhu Ziyin. His home was flooded, his furniture and bedding were soaked in water, and his house was teetering on the verge of collapse. However, he didn't even think about these things, but spurred on the commune's livestock to run to the high ground. And there is production team leader Liu Tingxi, who was desperately trying to salvage the commune's grain. Only after most of the grain was rescued did he realize that he only had the two thin pieces of clothing he was wearing left, but he smiled contentedly. Look at that technician who rescued a commune member, but he almost got washed away by the flood... What a lovable group of people! They are fearless. Their bodies are so small compared to the flood, but their spirit is much stronger than the flood. They can always hold high the red banner of the Party's ideology and move forward. They are not afraid of the flood; the flood is somewhat afraid of them. How can the masses not love such Party members and cadres? They truly deserve to be called the excellent sons and daughters educated by the Party, the good leaders of the people.

Driven by such Party members and cadres, and inspired and moved by their exemplary behavior and soaring enthusiasm, how can the masses not rise up to fight the disaster and strive for production and self-salvation! Look, haven't the people of Gaodianzi Township already taken action and plunged into a new battle? They work hard day and night, draining water and plowing fields, and replanting. Look, their autumn crops are growing again, growing taller. They are working hard and trying every means to take back what the flood took away.

    把洪水抢走的夺回来
    临难不惧，不气馁，不泄气，且以冲天干劲，带头与洪水搏斗，力争挽回危局，战胜灾害，这是高甸子乡共产党员和干部表现出的英雄气概。他们在千钧一发之际，公而忘家，舍己为群，奋不顾身地抢救公社财产，抢救群众，这种高尚行为真是可歌可泣。
    你看，那是共产党员朱子印，他的家被水淹了，家具被褥泡在水里，房子也在摇摇欲坠。然而，他连想都没想到这些，只是一鼓劲地赶着公社的牲畜往岗地上跑。还有那生产队长刘廷喜，他在拼命地抢运公社的粮食。当粮食大部救出之后，他才发现自己只剩下身穿的两件单衣服，但是他却满意地笑了。你看那个技术员救出了一个社员，而他却差一点被洪水冲走……。这是一群多么可爱的人啊！他们是无畏的。他们一个人的身体和洪水比起来，是太小太小了，但是，他们的精神比洪水强大得多。他们在任何时候都能高举党的思想红旗前进。他们不怕洪水，洪水倒有点怕他们呢。这样的党员，这样的干部，群众怎么能不爱戴？他们真不愧是党教育出来的优秀儿女，人民的好带路人。
    在这样的党员和干部的带动下，在他们这种模范行为和冲天干劲的鼓舞和感召下，群众还能不个个奋起抗灾、力争生产自救吗！你看，高甸子乡的人民不是已经行动起来，投入新的战斗了吗？他们披星戴月，昼夜苦战，排水犁田，重新播种。你看，他们的秋庄稼又长出来了，长高了。他们正鼓足干劲，想方设法，一定要将洪水抢走的夺回来。
