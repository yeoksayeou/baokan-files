Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: Newspapers here today published a report from the "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on August 3rd, stating that the Lao people are extremely angry about the United States and the Sananikone government's plot to expand the civil war and intensify the suppression and persecution of Lao patriots, and have taken action. In many places in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, the people and the people's armed forces have risen up and fought against the Royal Army.

The "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" said that in Muong Son district in the western part of Sam Neua province, the people and their armed forces attacked and captured the three strongholds of the Lao Royal Army in the district, namely, San Neua, San Dai, and Sa Thong, on the evening of July 24th, and seized a batch of weapons.

The newspaper said that since the Lao Royal Government took over the rule of the Sam Neua area at the end of 1957, the heads of these strongholds have arrested many former resistance personnel and carried out many terrorist sweeps against the people, and have prohibited normal communication between the people. These activities have caused great difficulties to the lives of the people. In order to attempt to eliminate the Second Battalion of the former Lao Fighting Forces, the Phoui Sananikone government even cut off the supply of daily necessities to the people, causing a serious shortage of salt and agricultural implements in the area.

The newspaper said that the people of Muong Son had repeatedly sent delegations to meet with the authorities of the strongholds and demanded that they release the detainees, improve the living conditions of the people, and earnestly implement the Vientiane Agreement. However, the authorities stubbornly refused the people's demands and instead opened fire on the people, resulting in an armed conflict on July 24th. This battle was supported and sympathized with by some of the Royal Army. In this battle, the people's armed forces captured these strongholds, killing some reactionary ringleaders, seizing three machine guns, a radio, and many livestock that the Royal Army had plundered from the people.

The "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" also reported that the people's armed forces in the Sonau area in southeastern Phongsaly captured an important stronghold of the Lao army there on the evening of July 29th. The commander of the Sonau stronghold, Thiao Van Vanh, was seriously wounded and died. The people's armed forces captured some of the Royal Army and seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, radios, and food.

The troops stationed at the Sonau stronghold were the Tai Dam puppet army formerly used by the French colonialists in northwestern Vietnam. After the French army withdrew, these troops, led by Thiao Van Long, were used by the Sananikone clique and remained stationed in some areas of Phongsaly province. They committed all kinds of evil deeds, and the local people hated them very much. Thiao Van Vanh was one of Thiao Van Long's henchmen.

The "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" said that the Royal Army subsequently launched retaliatory attacks on the Sonau and Muong Son areas. The newspaper said that the local people and armed forces are uniting more closely to continue their heroic struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th: According to a report in the "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on August 5th, published in Hanoi newspapers today, the people of Sam Neua province in Laos are organizing armed self-defense forces and have captured many strongholds of the Sananikone government army in Sangthong and Xieng Khouang districts of the province, liberating most of the two districts.

On August 1st, the people's armed forces in Sangthong district in southeastern Sam Neua province, with the assistance of some Royal Army soldiers who had revolted, captured the two Royal Army strongholds of Ban Sao and Muong Na in the district, killing reactionary ringleaders who were covered in blood debts and seizing a batch of weapons. At the same time, the Lao Royal Army stationed at Muong Bao, another stronghold in Sangthong district, also abandoned the stronghold and fled for their lives. Thus, most of Sangthong district was liberated.

On July 31st, the Sananikone government troops at the Sop Ao stronghold in Xieng Khouang district in northeastern Sam Neua province went out to persecute the people, and clashed with the people's armed forces. After fierce fighting, the Royal Army was defeated and fled in disarray, leaving behind nine dead bodies. Some of them surrendered to the people's ranks. The people's armed forces then occupied this stronghold.

On the same day, the Royal Army at the Sop Ping stronghold in Xieng Khouang district launched a "sweep." The people's armed forces called on them to revolt, and as a result, four people joined the people's ranks, eight were killed, and some were wounded.

These victories encouraged the people of Xieng Khouang district, and the people's armed forces were active everywhere. The Royal Army was very panicked and finally withdrew the troops from all the strongholds in the district. The vast area of Xieng Khouang district was thus liberated.

    桑怒和丰沙里人民奋起战斗
    人民武装解放桑德和川库两县大部地区
    新华社河内7日电　此间报纸今天刊载“川圹老挝爱国报”8月3日报道的消息说，老挝人民对美国和萨纳尼空政府扩大内战和加紧镇压和迫害老挝爱国者的阴谋十分愤怒而采取了行动。在桑怒和丰沙里两省许多地方的人民和人民武装力量曾经奋起和王国军队作战。
    “川圹老挝爱国报”说，在桑怒省西部芒山县的人民和他们的武装力量在7月24日晚间攻下了老挝王国军队在这个县的山怒、山岱和沙通三个据点，并且缴获一批武器。
    报纸说，桑怒地区自从1957年末由老挝王国政府统治后，这些据点的头子逮捕了许多前抗战人员和对人民进行了许多次恐怖的扫荡，并且禁止人民的正常来往。这些活动给人民的生活造成了极大的困难。培·萨纳尼空政府为了企图消灭前寮国战斗部队第二营，甚至切断了对人民的日用必需品的供应，引起了这个地区严重缺乏盐和农具的情况。
    报纸说，芒山人民曾经一再派代表团去会见据点当局，并且要求他们释放被拘留者，改善人民生活条件和认真履行万象协议。但当局顽固地拒绝了人民的要求，反而向人民开枪，因此在7月24日发生了武装冲突。这次战斗获得了一部分王国军队的同情和支持。人民的武装力量在这次战斗中攻下了这些据点，打死一些反动头目，缴获了三挺机枪，一部收音机和许多王国军队从老百姓手里抢来的牲口。
    “川圹老挝爱国报”还报道，在丰沙里东南的索瑙地区的人民的武装力量7月29日晚间攻陷了老挝军队在那里的重要据点，索瑙据点指挥官刁文温重伤死亡。人民武装力量俘掳了部分王国军队，并且缴获了大量武器、弹药、收音机和粮食等。
    驻在索瑙据点的军队是法国殖民者以前在越南西北的傣族伪军。法军撤退后，这些以刁文龙为首的军队被萨纳尼空集团利用，仍驻在丰沙里省的一些地方，他们无恶不作，当地人民都非常痛恨他们。刁文温是刁文龙的爪牙。
      “川圹老挝爱国报”说，王国军队事后对索瑙和芒山地区进行了报复性的袭击。报纸说，但当地人民和武装部队正更紧密地团结一致，继续进行英勇的战斗。
    新华社河内8日电　据河内报纸今天刊载“川圹老挝爱国报”8月5日报道的消息说，老挝桑怒省人民纷纷组织武装力量自卫，并且攻下了萨纳尼空政府军队在这个省桑德和川库两县的许多据点，解放了两县的大部分地区。
    8月1日，桑怒省东南部桑德县人民的武装力量在部分反正的王国军队的援助下，攻下了这个县的本造和芒那两个王国军队据点，打死了血债累累的反动头目，缴获了一批武器。同时，驻守在桑德县另一个据点芒包的老挝王国军队也丢弃据点逃命。这样，桑德县的大部分地区就获得了解放。
    7月31日，桑怒省东北部川库县索保据点的萨纳尼空政府军队四出迫害人民，同人民的武装力量发生冲突，经过激战后，王国军队被打得落花流水，各自逃命，丢下了九个死尸，还有一部分人向人民的队伍投诚。人民的武装随着占领了这个据点。
    同一天，川库县索平据点的王国军队出动“扫荡”，人民武装力量号召他们反正，结果有四人投向人民队伍，八人被击毙，部分人受伤。
    这些胜利鼓舞了川库县的人民，人民武装力量四起活动。王国军队非常惊慌，终于撤走县内所有据点的兵力。川库县的广大地区从而获得解放。
