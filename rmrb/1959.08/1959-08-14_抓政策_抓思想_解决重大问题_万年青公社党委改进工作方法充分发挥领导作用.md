Grasping Policies, Grasping Ideology, Solving Major Problems
Wannianging Commune Party Committee Improves Working Methods, Fully Demonstrates Leadership Role

(Our newspaper Taiyuan, August 13th) Since May of this year, the Communist Party Committee of Wannianging People's Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, has changed its working methods. By freeing itself from the daily routine of the commune and concentrating its main energy on studying the Party's policies and going deep into reality and the masses to conduct investigation and research, it has solved a number of issues of a fundamental nature, thereby greatly enhancing the Party's leadership role.

In the early days of the establishment of the Wannianging People's Commune, due to incomplete institutions and a lack of leadership experience among cadres, the commune party committee spent most of its energy on routine affairs. This resulted in a very abnormal situation: on the one hand, several party committee secretaries were extremely tired, unable to keep up no matter how hard they tried, and on the other hand, they made some subjective decisions because they could not go deep down to conduct serious investigation and research, which caused dissatisfaction in relevant areas. Furthermore, the fact that the commune party committee did not have enough energy to strengthen the Party's regular work also weakened the combat effectiveness of the Party organization to some extent.

In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the commune, the Wannianging People's Commune Party Committee changed its leadership methods starting in May this year. The commune party committee focused its main energy on the following aspects: implementing the Party and state's guidelines and policies; determining the principles for the commune's production management, income distribution, welfare, and financial management; formulating the commune's construction plans; strengthening the Party's political and ideological work among the masses, and frequently listening to the opinions of the masses; enhancing leadership over youth, women, militia, and other organizations, in order to fully utilize their role; managing and training cadres, carrying out organizational education work for grassroots party organizations and party members, and developing new party members. As for the day-to-day work of the government, public security, production, labor, distribution, finance, welfare, culture, education, health, etc., it is all managed by the Commune Management Committee. The Commune Management Committee strengthened the original Commune Office. Routine work such as relaying information, statistical reports, civil disputes, and contacts with various parties are all handled by the office. At the same time, the members of the Commune Management Committee also improved the division of labor for agriculture, industry, finance and economics, culture and education, health, and armed security.

For each period of work, after the Party Committee determines the principles based on the spirit of the Party's policies and the local reality, it is handed over to the Commune Management Committee for specific discussion and implementation. The day-to-day work is carried out by the members of the Management Committee. The Commune Management Committee requires each Management Committee member to delve into the actual work for which they are responsible, while also giving them the necessary rights to solve problems in their day-to-day work. For example, in the past, the approval of daily financial expenditures, the transfer of labor, and the signing of various contracts with outside parties were all managed by the secretary himself, but now they are managed by the deputy director of the commune in charge of finance. As another example, the commune recently planned to build a dairy farm and a non-staple food processing plant. The Commune Party Committee discussed and approved the principles of the construction scale and tasks, and then the relevant Party Committee members took the opinions to the Commune Management Committee to work out a specific implementation plan, which was finally implemented by Guo Shuzhong, the director in charge of the commune's industry. While giving full play to the role of the Management Committee, the Commune Party Committee also paid attention to strengthening its leadership over the Management Committee. The Commune Party Committee established a system of meeting every ten days. Every ten days, the members of the Party Committee hold a meeting to listen to the comrades in charge of various tasks report to the Party Committee on their work and the problems in their respective departments. Based on its own understanding of the situation and the problems raised in the reports, the Commune Party Committee then proposes suggestions for the next step of work to the Management Committee after discussion.

Practice over the past three months has proven that this approach has not only freed the Party Committee from routine affairs, but also fully utilized the role of the Management Committee, and also solved problems more promptly than in the past.

After being freed from routine affairs, the Commune Party Committee has been able to work more deeply than before. In the past, the First Secretary could only go to the countryside for six or seven days a month, but now he spends twenty days a month living among the commune members, working alongside them and conducting investigations and analysis. In recent months, the Party Committee of this commune has also adopted the method of summing up typical examples to improve the working ability of grassroots cadres. For example, they recently summarized the methods of Song Shuxun, the Party Branch Secretary of Jiajiazhuang Management District, who insisted on following the mass line and collective leadership. After systematic summarization, it was very helpful and enlightening for the management district cadres. Regarding production management, the Commune Party Committee also summarized the experience of Jiajiazhuang Management District in field management and labor management. After these experiences and lessons were disseminated through on-site meetings and other forms, the working ability of the cadres of the commune, management district, and production team was greatly improved, and production was directly promoted.

After being freed from routine administrative work, the Party's political and ideological education and organizational life in the commune have also begun to be strengthened. The Party Committee Secretary and members return to the commune every ten days or half a month to participate in organizational life, exchange ideas at the meeting, and study the problems discovered after delving deep, so that they can study and solve some major problems in a timely manner. With the specific assistance of the Party Committee, the Party branches in various management districts have also changed their past method of handling all matters regardless of whether they are within or outside the Party. Now, when the various management districts implement the Party and state's policies, they first go through full discussion at the Party branch meeting to put forward opinions, and then hand them over to the Management Committee of the management district for specific discussion and implementation. In the past three months, in addition to maintaining regular organizational life, the Party branches in various management districts have also improved the learning system for spare-time Party lessons. Because the Party's work has been strengthened, the enthusiasm of Party members has also been mobilized. Among the twenty-eight Party members in Jiajiazhuang Management District, twenty-six have been selected by the commune members as models in the recent three evaluations over three months.

### 抓政策　抓思想　解决重大问题  万年青公社党委改进工作方法充分发挥领导作用

    抓政策　抓思想　解决重大问题
    万年青公社党委改进工作方法充分发挥领导作用
    本报太原13日电　中共山西省汾阳县万年青人民公社委员会，自今年5月改变工作方法以来，由于摆脱了公社的日常事务工作，集中主要精力研究党的政策和深入实际、深入群众从事调查研究，解决一些具有方针性的问题，从而大大地增强了党的领导作用。
    万年青人民公社在成立初期，因为机构不健全，干部缺乏领导经验，致使公社党委的精力大部分花在日常事务工作中，结果形成很不正常的状况：一方面几个党委书记十分劳累，紧抓慢抓都抓不过来，另一方面他们又由于不能深入下去认真进行调查研究，也作了一些主观主义的决定，引起了有关方面的不满。再就是由于公社党委没有足够的精力来加强党的经常性的工作，也在一定程度上削弱了党组织的战斗力。
    为了加强党对公社的领导，万年青人民公社党委会从今年5月起改变领导方法。公社党委把主要精力放在以下几个方面：贯彻党和国家的方针政策；确定公社生产管理：收益分配、生活福利、财务管理的原则；制订公社建设规划；加强党在群众中的政治思想工作，经常听取群众意见；增强对青年、妇女、民兵等组织的领导，以便充分发挥它们的作用；对干部的管理和培养，对基层党组织和党员的组织教育工作，发展新党员的工作。至于日常的政权、治安、生产、劳动、分配、财务、福利、文化、教育、卫生等具体工作一律由公社管理委员会管起来。公社管理委员会加强了原来的公社办公室，一些日常呈上启下的工作，统计表报，民事纠纷和各方面的联系等事情，都由办公室去做。同时，公社管理委员会的委员也就农业、工业、财经、文教卫生、武装治安等方面健全了分工制度。
    每个时期的各项工作，党委根据党的政策精神和当地实际情况确定了原则以后，交给公社管理委员会具体讨论贯彻，经常性的工作就由管理委员会委员去作。公社管理委员会对每个管理委员，既要求他们深入到他们分工负责的实际中去；同时也使他们拥有应有的权利，解决日常工作中的问题。例如过去审批日常的财务开支，抽调劳力，和外边订立各种合同，都要书记亲自管理，现在就由公社主管财务的副主任管理。再如最近公社要建设一座奶牛场和一座副食品加工厂，公社党委会讨论通过了建设的规模和任务等原则，然后由有关的党委委员把意见带到公社管理委员会研究出具体实施方案，最后由分工管理公社工业的主任郭守忠负责执行。在充分发挥管理委员会作用的同时，公社党委还注意加强对管理委员会的领导。公社党委会建立了十天一碰头的制度，每十天党委的委员开会，听取分管各项工作的同志向党委汇报他们的工作和他们本部门工作中的问题。公社党委根据自己深入以后了解的情况和汇报中提出的问题，经过讨论然后再向管理委员会提出下一步工作的意见。
    三个多月来，实践证明这样作，既使党委摆脱了日常事务，又能充分发挥管理委员会的作用，而且解决问题也比过去及时了。
    公社党委摆脱了日常事务工作以后，工作比以前深入了。过去第一书记一个月只能下乡六、七天，现在一个月就有二十天是生活在社员群众中，一边跟社员共同劳动，一边进行调查分析。这个公社的党委会，在最近几个月，还采取了典型总结的办法提高基层干部的工作能力。例如最近总结了贾家庄管理区支部书记宋树勋坚持走群众路线和集体领导的方法。经过系统的总结，对管理区干部的帮助和启发都很大。关于生产管理，公社党委会又总结了贾家庄管理区的田间管理和劳动管理的经验，这些经验和教训通过现场会议和其他形式传播以后，大大提高了公社、管理区、生产队干部的工作能力，也直接推动了生产。
    公社党委摆脱了日常行政事务工作以后，公社党的政治思想教育工作和组织生活也开始加强了。党委书记和委员每十天或半个月回公社过一次组织生活，在会上交流思想，研究深入以后发现的问题，能对一些重大问题及时研究解决。在党委会的具体帮助下，各管理区党支部也改变了过去不分党内党外的一揽子的工作方法。现在各管理区在贯彻党和国家政策的时候，都是先经过党支部大会充分讨论，提出意见，然后交管理区管理委员会具体讨论执行。最近三个月，各管理区党支部除坚持定期的组织生活外，还健全了业余党课的学习制度。由于党的工作加强了，党员的积极性也就被调动起来了。贾家庄管理区二十八个党员，在最近三个月的三次评比中，就有二十六名被社员评选成为模范。
