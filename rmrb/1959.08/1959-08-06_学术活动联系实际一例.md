    An Example of Integrating Academic Activities with Practical Application
    Shen Changchun
    The scientific community in Hebei Province has created a method for academic activities: organizing technical field investigations.

    The biggest characteristic of this academic activity is its close connection with reality, and it has promoted current production.  At the beginning of the technical field investigation activities, the purpose was very clear.  Investigations were conducted based on the current practical production situation to understand the problems urgently needing to be solved, to conduct immediate research, and to immediately propose measures.  They worked with real effort and at the right time.  Therefore, the actual effect was very good and welcomed by all parties.

    This academic activity also has another characteristic. The technical investigation team is comprehensive, including relevant experts, which also adapts to the requirements of actual production. The problems raised by actual production are diverse, and the solution of a problem is related to many disciplines.  Their joint operation can propose practical measures to solve the problems on the spot.

    For scientific workers, such academic activities are rich and colorful. Many scientific workers who participated in the technical investigation have a common experience. Before they went down to conduct technical investigations, their academic research had great limitations, often only looking for evidence from books, and no matter how much they worked, they still found it difficult to break out of the academic circle.  However, this time, during the technical investigation, once they came into contact with the actual production of the peasant masses, their minds suddenly opened up, and the production practice of the broad masses provided many research topics and valuable materials.

    It can be seen that the characteristics of academic activities are also reflected in the technical investigation. They widely understand the actual situation of production, collect a large amount of materials, analyze and research, and then summarize and generalize to form conclusions with theoretical colors.  Based on this, they propose technical measures to guide production to advance smoothly. At the same time, their activities also promote the development of agricultural science. Such technical field investigation activities further enrich the content of scientific research.

    学术活动联系实际一例
    申昌淳
    河北省科学界创造了一种学术活动的方法：组织技术考察。
    这一学术活动的最大特点是紧密联系实际，而且对当前的生产起了推动作用。技术考察活动一开始，目的性就十分明确。针对当前的生产实际情况进行考察，了解急需解决的问题，当即研究，当即提出措施。他们真刀真枪地干，而且适当其时。所以实际的效果很好，受到各方面的欢迎。
    这一学术活动还有一个特点。技术考察团是综合性的，包括了有关的专家，这也适应了生产实际的要求。生产实际提出的问题是多样化的，而且一个问题的解决，关系到许多学科，他们联合作战，就能够当场提出解决问题的切实的措施。
    就科学工作者来说，这样的学术活动，内容是丰富多彩的。参加技术考察的许多科学工作者都有一个共同的体会。当他们没有下去进行技术考察以前，自己的学术研究有很大的局限性，常常只是从书本上寻找根据，搞来搞去，仍然难以跳出学院式的圈圈。但是，这次在技术考察中，一接触农民群众的生产实际，脑子就豁然开朗，广大群众的生产实践，提供了许多研究课题和宝贵材料。
    可以看到，在技术考察中，也是体现了学术活动的特点的。他们广泛地了解生产实际的情况，大量地搜集材料，分析、研究，然后总结、概括，形成带有理论色彩的结论。在这基础上，他们提出技术措施，指导生产顺利前进。同时，他们这样的活动对农业科学的发展，也有促进作用。这样的技术考察活动，更丰富了科学研究的内容。
