　　Unstable Japanese Economy
　　Xin Qiao
    The Japanese economy sharply entered a crisis in August 1957. After intense production cuts and declines, it began to recover last autumn. By last December, the industrial and mining production index rose to 157 (1955 = 100, seasonally adjusted, same below), exceeding the pre-crisis peak of 153.2 in May 1957. From January to March this year, the average industrial and mining production index was 160.1, exceeding the pre-crisis peak by 4.5%. However, the production recovery was very uneven. Those sectors that were less affected by the crisis and have recovered and continued to rise, such as machinery, petroleum, coal products, chemicals, and paper and pulp industries, have exceeded the pre-crisis peak by 9% to 17% respectively. Those sectors that were severely affected by the crisis but recovered rapidly, such as non-ferrous metals, iron and steel, cement, and rubber industries, have recovered to 97% to 99% of the pre-crisis peak, with only shipbuilding still 20% below the peak. As for the coal and textile industries, they are still trapped in severe overproduction from which they cannot escape. This recovery is also reflected in increased corporate profits and equipment investment.

      What are the reasons for the recovery?
    This rapid production recovery is primarily the result of large-scale production cuts and reduced operating rates. During the crisis, Japanese companies were forced to reduce their operating rates. Generally, production industries cut production by more than 30%, and some, such as medium-sized steel and rayon, cut production by as much as 48% to 50%. Based on these production cuts, industrial and mining production fell by 11%, with non-ferrous metals falling by 22.7%, iron and steel industry falling by 20.4%, rubber falling by 20.4%, coal falling by 18%, and the textile industry falling by 17.6%. At the same time, wholesale prices fell by 12.3%
  (with June 18-24, 1950, as 100, falling from 174.6 on March 16, 1957, to 153.2 on August 16, 1958). The sharp decline in production and wholesale prices to some extent undermined overproduction.

    Secondly, large-scale government spending and relaxed financial measures played an important role in stimulating Japan's economic recovery. In fiscal year 1958, the government's fiscal deficit was 251 billion yen, and the fiscal surplus of 259.7 billion yen from fiscal year 1957 was also used. The actual execution of the government's fiscal investment and loan plan exceeded the original plan by 8%. This was an important measure taken by the Japanese government during the economic crisis to directly help monopoly groups carry out industrial "rationalization" and seize profits. These fiscal expenditures were mainly concentrated on public utility projects, namely the construction of roads, ports, and residential investment, so the industrial sectors related to these areas rapidly improved. The 1959 budget even more prominently reflects the characteristics of Japanese monopoly capital's attempt to stimulate the economy through national fiscal expenditure. They use national investment and loans to develop power sources, implement "modernization of state-owned railways," extensively repair roads and ports, and stimulate "domestic demand" to support the desperate Japanese economy. From June 1958 to February 19, this year, the Japanese government lowered interest rates three times. The discount rate fell from 2.3 sen per diem to 1.9 sen, and the loan interest rate fell from 2.6 sen per diem to 2.2 sen, the lowest interest rate since 1948. For monopoly capital, relaxed financial measures not only enable them to obtain large amounts of loans, allowing large enterprises to maintain production under the heavy pressure of overproduction, but also obtain extra profits from low interest rates. For example, for a large enterprise like Yawata Iron & Steel Co., a reduction of 1 sen in the interest rate can yield an extra profit of hundreds of millions of yen a year. More importantly, these measures stimulated the strong desire of monopoly enterprises to invest. According to a survey by the Development Bank, industrial equipment investment in 1958 reached 661.9 billion yen in general loans alone, 50.1 billion yen more than in 1957. The intensity of monopoly capital's investment desire can be imagined.

    Thirdly, four consecutive years of good harvests in agriculture and increased demand for durable consumer goods have, to some extent, stabilized market purchasing power. Among them, rice production in 1958 increased by 5% compared with the previous year, and the cash income of farmers also increased by 5.7%. Due to increased production costs, the net income of ordinary Japanese farmers has tended to decrease, and rural consumption has stagnated; however, the purchase volume of means of production (mainly small tractors, cultivators, power sprayers, and three-wheeled vehicles, etc.) centered on rich and middle peasants has increased significantly. The popularity of durable consumer goods in urban and rural areas has also greatly increased compared with the past. Household electrical appliances in cities have increased by 1.6 times in one year. However, this mainly relies on installment purchases. The amount of installment purchases in 1958 accounted for 4% to 5% of the total national expenditure, and an average of 7% to 11% of personal consumption expenditure. This method of "living beyond one's means" by pre-spending purchasing power creates a false market prosperity and is only a temporary factor that cannot last.

    Fourthly, the dumping of steel, shipbuilding orders, and increased exports in the second half of last year also played a certain role in the economic recovery. In 1958, Japan's steel exports increased by 55% compared with the previous year, but export prices fell by 34% compared with the previous year. This was mainly due to exports to the United States (doubled in 1958 compared to 1957). This is because after the recovery of industrial production in the United States since May last year, the need for steel surged, and there was a temporary phenomenon of supply falling short of demand, so it turned to Japan for large-scale purchases. At the same time, Japan's exports of small cars to the United States have also greatly increased. In addition, in order to welcome the "golden year" of shipping in 1960, Greek shipowners have placed large orders with the Japanese shipbuilding industry. And the expansion of the Suez Canal has stimulated the construction of large oil tankers. Therefore, Japan's shipbuilding orders suddenly increased from September last year. In February of this year, export trade also increased due to the export of ships to Panama.

    As mentioned above, the reasons for Japan's economic recovery, in addition to the reduction of production and the decline in prices, the artificial measures taken by state monopoly capitalism to stimulate production and consumption also played a significant role.

      Is it really stable?
    Japanese monopoly capitalists and government officials are deliriously boasting that the Japanese economy has "stabilized from now on." Has the Japanese economy really stabilized? No. Although the Japanese economy has climbed out of the crisis, it has not fully escaped the threat of overproduction. On the contrary, the factors of overproduction continue to deepen. This is manifested in: First, equipment capacity is unprecedentedly excessive. By the end of December 1958, the manufacturing production capacity had been 3.46 times that of 1950. That is, even during the crisis period (June 1957 to December 1958), it increased by 15%. At present, the idle situation of equipment in many industrial sectors is very serious. Although production exceeds the pre-crisis peak, the operating rate has only recovered to 72.1%, which is lower than the 84.1% during the "prosperity" period (June 1957). The Japanese government also admits that the highest operating rate in the current year will not exceed 73.5%. Second, inventory pressure is still very high. This crisis has not solved the problem of excessive inventory. The inventory index in March this year was 155 (1955 = 100), which is much higher than the average of 126.5 in 1957. It decreased somewhat in April, but is still above the 1957 level. Moreover, the inventory of those rapidly recovering sectors has tended to increase due to blind competition.

    Japanese monopoly capital is investing in adventures like crazy, which can only add fuel to the fire and intensify the contradiction between production and the market. According to surveys by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Development Bank, equipment investment in the current year has increased by 18% compared with the previous year (the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry believes it has increased by 32%).
  The surge in equipment investment will put greater pressure on the market. The disconnection between rapidly growing production capacity and the relatively shrinking domestic and foreign markets has deepened the unstable situation of the Japanese economy.

    The Japanese economy still faces the threat of export difficulties and a shrinking domestic consumer market. Japan's foreign trade faces two insurmountable contradictions. First, Japan's unequal and unilateral trade with economically underdeveloped countries has exacerbated the contradictions between Japan and these countries. The biggest feature of Japan's foreign trade after the war is to make up for the trade deficit with the United States with the trade surplus with Southeast Asia and other underdeveloped countries. Japan's exports to Southeast Asian countries generally account for 30% of its total exports, while imports from Southeast Asian countries account for only 20% of its total imports. Brazil is a key country for Japan's economic expansion in Latin America. Due to Japan's imbalanced trade, Brazil has accumulated huge debts. Japan's trade exports to African countries are more than 400 million US dollars, and imports are only more than 80 million US dollars. In fact, economically underdeveloped countries, headed by Southeast Asian countries, have become objects of Japan's expansion, plunder, and sacrifices to the United States. As a result, the financial difficulties and foreign exchange crises of these countries have deepened, causing their dissatisfaction with Japan. Thailand, Myanmar, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq have all demanded that Japan purchase their main products and special products; Brazil has demanded that Japan give priority to purchasing Brazilian goods; East African countries have launched movements to restrict the import of Japanese goods and impose anti-dumping duties. Secondly, with the emergence of the Western European "Common Market" and the free convertibility of currencies, the Western European trade war is intensifying. Japan is facing an unprecedentedly acute struggle to seize the international market. The struggle in the international market depends on commodity prices, structure, and the strength of capital output, and Japan is at a disadvantage in these aspects. In terms of commodity prices, Japan is more competitive only in cotton yarn, rayon, and their products. Other heavy industrial products are higher than those of West Germany and the United Kingdom. Japan's export commodities cannot meet the increasing demand for imported capital goods in Southeast Asian countries. In the post-war foreign trade structure of Japan, the proportion of heavy industry and chemical industry has increased somewhat
  (accounting for 48% in 1958), but it is still centered on light industry, especially the textile industry. Capital output (including national loans and private investment) is a prerequisite for improving the payment ability of these countries and expanding exports. Although Japan has begun to carry out capital output, it has a weak foundation and lacks the strength. Taking foreign exchange reserves as an example, Japan had 1.073 billion US dollars in May this year, but it is insignificant compared with West Germany's approximately 6 billion US dollars and the United Kingdom's 3.2 billion US dollars.

    Japan is also encountering insurmountable difficulties in the domestic consumer market. First of all, due to the increase in the unemployed population, the average monthly number of fully unemployed people in the first quarter of this year was 766,000, an increase of 116,000 compared with the same period last year. In April, due to seasonal factors, it decreased to 570,000, but it is still higher than the level of the same period last year. In fact, the unemployed population in Japan far exceeds this number. Even the Japanese employer representative attending the "International Labour Organization" (reactionary international trade union organization) reported that the number of unemployed people in Japan is huge, with more than 6 million unregistered unemployed workers. In addition, there are tens of millions of potential unemployed. Secondly, the production recovery has not only failed to improve the living conditions of workers, but has deteriorated due to the government's increase in taxes and consumer prices. The Kishi Nobusuke government approved the private railway to increase fares by 15.3% and the automobile company to increase freight rates by 10% at the end of last year, and indirect taxes are becoming increasingly heavy. The rural situation is also the same. The "Survey Report on Agricultural Harvests and Economic Trends" released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance in May this year also admitted that although the four consecutive years of good harvests had a stabilizing effect on the market during the "economic recession," they no longer have the power to stimulate the economic recovery today. Farmers' incomes are stagnant, and the gap between rich and poor is widening. As long as the income of small farmers with less than 1 cho of cultivated land cannot be improved, even if there is a good harvest in the future, there is no hope of increasing rural demand.

    Faced with these situations, some bourgeois people with clear minds have felt uneasy. The Japanese banking community and the "Economic Doyukai," a think tank of Japanese big capitalists, have been worried and afraid of "overdevelopment of the Japanese economy," predicting that "the Japanese economy will die prematurely," and warning the Japanese government "not to forget the pain after the wound has healed," and to beware of "falling."

          The prospect is not good
    At present, due to the support of the two major pillars of equipment investment and government fiscal budget, the Japanese economy will continue to rise for a period of time in the future. But all these factors are actively creating conditions for new economic shocks and crises. Japan has experienced three crises after the war, namely the 1949-50 crisis, the 1953-54 crisis, and the 1957-58 crisis, and the 1957-58 crisis was the longest and most profound crisis since the war. The development process of the past few crises has been under the conditions of economic recovery and large-scale equipment renewal. The intervals between the crises are relatively long, generally two and a half to three years. At present, the threat of overproduction is still serious. With the continuous investment of new investments into production and the outbreak of the counter-effects of state monopoly capitalism, the contradiction between production and the market will rapidly intensify. Under these conditions, it is entirely conceivable that the recurrence of the crisis will only accelerate, and the interval between the crises will become shorter and shorter. Some Japanese economists believe that the Japanese economic recovery situation generally continues for about a year and a half, and it is estimated that it will not last long this time.

　　不稳定的日本经济
　　辛乔
    日本经济从1957年8月急剧地进入危机，经过激烈的减产、下降后，去年秋季开始回升。到去年12月，工矿业生产指数上升为157，（1955年为100，经过季节调整，下同。）超过危机前最高点1957年5月的153.2。今年1—3月工矿业生产平均指数为160.1，超过危机前最高点4.5％。但生产回升很不平衡。那些在危机中受打击较少，已经恢复而且继续上升的部门，如机械、石油、煤炭制品、化学、造纸及纸浆工业，均已分别超过危机前最高点9％—17％。在危机中受打击较重而迅速回升的部门，如非铁金属、钢铁、水泥、橡胶工业等，已恢复到危机前最高点的97％—99％，只有造船业还低于最高点20％。至于煤炭、纺织工业仍陷于无法摆脱的严重生产过剩。这种回升也表现为企业利润和设备投资的增加。
      回升的原因何在？
    这次生产迅速回升，首先是大规模的缩减生产和压低开工率的结果。在危机中，日本的企业被迫压低开工率。一般生产行业减产30％以上，有的如中型钢和人造丝的减产高达48％—50％。在减产基础上，工矿业生产下降了11％，其中非铁金属下降22.7％、钢铁工业下降20.4％、橡胶下降20.4％、煤炭降18％、纺织工业下降17.6％。同时批发物价下降了12.3％
  （以1950年6月18—24日为100，从1957年3月16日的174.6跌至1958年8月16日的153.2）。生产和批发物价的剧烈下降，在某种程度上破坏了生产过剩。
    其次，政府的大量财政开支和放宽金融措施，对日本经济回升起了重要的刺激作用。1958年度政府财政超支二千五百一十亿日元，还用掉了1957年度财政收支结余二千五百九十七亿日元。政府的财政投资和贷款计划执行结果，比原计划增加了8％。这是日本政府在经济危机中直接帮助垄断集团进行产业“合理化”和攫取利润的重要措施。这些财政开支主要集中于公用事业工程即建设道路、港湾和住宅投资上，因而与此有关的产业部门都迅速好转起来。1959年度的预算更突出地反映了日本垄断资本企图借国家财政开支刺激经济的特点，他们利用国家的投资和贷款，开发电源，实行“国营铁道现代化”，大修道路、港湾，刺激“国内需求”，用来支持走投无路的日本经济。日本政府从1958年6月到今年2月19日，前后三次降低利率。贴现率从日利二分三厘降为一分九厘，贷款利率由日利二分六厘降为二分二厘，成为1948年以来最低的利率。对垄断资本说来，放宽金融措施不仅能得到大批贷款使大企业在生产过剩的沉重压力下仍能维持生产；同时还可获得低利息的额外利润。比如，以八幡钢铁公司这个大企业来说，降低利率一厘，一年即可获得额外利润一亿数千万日元。更重要的是这类措施刺激了垄断企业进行投资的强烈欲望。据开发银行调查，1958年产业设备投资仅一般贷款即达六千六百一十九亿日元，比1957年多五百零一亿日元。垄断资本投资欲的强烈，可想而知。
    第三、农业连续四年丰收、耐用消费品的需求增加，在某种程度上稳定了市场的购买力。其中1958年产米比前一年增加5％，农家的现金收入也增加了5.7％。日本一般农家由于生产费用增加，纯收入有减少趋势，农村消费呈停滞状态；但以富、中农为中心的生产资料的购买量（主要是小型拖拉机、耕种机、动力喷雾机和三轮汽车等）却有明显的增加。城乡耐用消费品的普及程度也较前大为提高。城市中的家庭电气用具一年间增加了一点六倍。但其中主要是靠分期付款赊购的。1958年的赊购额，占国民总支出的4％—5％，平均占个人消费支出的7％—11％。这种“寅吃卯粮”预支购买力的办法，造成市场虚假繁荣，只是一种暂时性的因素，不可能持久。
    第四、去年下半年的钢铁倾销、船舶定货和出口的增加，对于经济回升也起了一定的作用。1958年日本钢铁出口比前一年增加55％，但出口价格却比前年下降了34％。其中主要是向美国出口（1958年比1957年增加一倍）。这是因为美国自去年5月工业生产回升后对钢铁的需要激增，一时发生供不应求现象，因而转向日本大量采购。同时日本向美国出口的小汽车，也大为增加。此外，为了迎接1960年度的航运“黄金年”，希腊船主大批向日本造船业提出订货。而苏伊士运河的扩建又刺激了大型油轮的建造。因此，日本自去年9月船舶定货突然增加起来。今年2月亦因向巴拿马输出船只而使出口贸易增加。
    如上所述，日本经济回升的原因，除了减缩生产和物价下降以外，国家垄断资本主义采取刺激生产和消费的人为措施也起了重大的作用。
      真的稳定了吗？
    日本垄断资本家和政府人士得意忘形地吹嘘日本经济“从此稳定了”。日本经济果真稳定了吗？不。日本经济虽然爬出危机，但没有充分摆脱生产过剩的威胁，相反地生产过剩因素还在继续加深。这表现在：第一、设备能力空前过剩。到1958年12月底止，制造业生产能力已为1950年的三点四六倍。即在危机时期（1957年6月—58年12月）也增加15％。目前许多产业部门设备闲置情况很严重。虽然生产超过危机前最高点，但开工率只恢复到72.1％，低于“繁荣”时期（1957年6月）的84.1％。日本政府也承认本年度的开工率最高也不过是73.5％。第二、库存压力仍然很大。这次危机并没有解决库存过剩问题。今年3月库存指数为155（1955年为100）远高于1957年平均的126.5，4月有所减少，但仍在1957年水平线以上。而且那些迅速回升部门的库存，由于盲目竞争反有增加趋势。
    日本垄断资本像发疯似地进行冒险投资，这只能是火上浇油，使生产与市场的矛盾更加激化。据日本通商产业省和开发银行的调查，本年度设备投资均比前一年度增加18％（日本商工会议所则认为增加32％）。
  设备投资激增，将对市场产生更大的压力。迅速增长的生产能力与相对缩小的国内外市场间的脱节，加深了日本经济的不稳定局面。
    日本经济依然面临出口困难和国内消费市场缩小的威胁。日本对外贸易面临着无法克服的两大矛盾。首先，由于日本对经济不发达国家的不平等的片面贸易，加剧了日本和这些国家的矛盾。战后日本对外贸易的最大特点，即以对东南亚等不发达国的出超来弥补对美国的入超。日本对东南亚国家的出口一般占其出口总额的30％，而从东南亚国家的进口仅占其进口总额的20％。巴西是日本对拉丁美洲进行经济扩张的重点国家，由于日本的不平衡贸易，致使巴西积欠了巨额债务。日本对非洲国家的贸易出口为四亿多美元，进口仅为八千多万美元，事实上，以东南亚各国为首的经济不发达国家，变成了日本的扩张、掠夺的对象和贡奉美国的牺牲品。结果，加深了这些国家的财政困难和外汇危机，引起他们对日本的不满。泰国、缅甸、巴基斯坦、伊朗和伊拉克等均要求日本购买本国主要产品和特产品；巴西要求日本优先购买巴西货；东非各国掀起限制日货进口和征收反倾销税的运动。其次，随着西欧“共同市场”出现和通货自由兑换，西欧贸易战日益激化。日本面临着空前尖锐的争夺国际市场的斗争。国际市场上的斗争，取决于商品价格、结构和资本输出的力量，而日本在这方面均处于劣势。在商品价格上日本除棉纱、人造丝及其制品的竞争能力较强外，其他重工业产品均较西德、英国为高。日本出口商品也不能适应东南亚国家日益增长的进口资本货物的要求。战后日本对外贸易结构中，重工业、化学工业的比重有所提高
  （1958年占48％），但仍以轻工业特别是纤维工业产品为中心。资本输出（包括国家贷款、私人投资）是提高这些国家支付能力、扩大出口的先决条件。日本虽然开始进行资本输出，但是底子空，力不从心。拿外汇储备来说，日本今年5月有十亿七千三百万美元，但与西德的约六十亿美元和英国的三十二亿美元相比则是小巫见大巫。
    日本在国内消费市场上也遭遇到无法摆脱的困难。首先由于失业人口增加，今年第一季度完全失业人口每月平均为七十六万六千人，比去年同期增加了十一万六千人。4月份由于季节关系减为五十七万，但仍高于去年同期的水平。实际上，日本失业人口远远超过这个数字，连日本出席“国际劳工组织”（反动的国际工会组织）的资方代表也报告日本失业人数巨大，未登记的失业工人在六百万以上。此外还有数以千万计的潜在的失业者。其次，生产回升，不仅没有使工人生活状况有所改善，反而由于政府提高捐税和消费物价而日趋恶化。岸信介政府在去年年底批准私营铁道提高票价15.3％、汽车公司提高运价10％，而且间接税愈来愈重。农村情况亦然。今年5月日本大藏省发表的“农业丰收和经济动向”的调查报告也承认，虽然连续四年的丰收在“经济衰退”中曾有稳定市场的作用，但到经济回升的今天已无刺激景气上升的力量。农民收入处于停滞状态，贫富差别愈来愈大。只要耕种一町步以下的小农阶层的收入无法改善，即使今后丰收，也无从希望农村需要有所增加。
    面对这些情况，某些资产阶级头脑清醒人士已感到不安。日本银行界、日本大资产阶级的智囊团“经济同友会”一直提心吊胆地害怕
  “日本经济过度发展”，预言“日本景气将要夭折”，警告日本政府“不要好了疮疤忘了痛”，当心“跌跤”。
          前景不妙
    目前由于设备投资和政府财政预算两大支柱的支持，日本经济今后还会继续一个时期的上升局面。但所有这些因素都在为新的经济震荡和危机，积极创造条件。战后日本发生过三次危机，这就是1949—50年危机、1953—54年危机和1957—58年危机，而1957—58年危机是战后以来持续最久和最深刻的一次危机。过去几次危机发展的过程，均处于经济恢复和大规模的设备更新的条件下，危机的间隔较长，一般在二年半到三年时间。目前生产过剩的威胁依然严重，随着新的投资陆续投入生产和国家垄断资本主义反作用的发作，生产与市场的矛盾将迅速激化。在这种条件下完全可以想像危机的再度降临，只会加速，危机的间隔将愈来愈短。日本某些经济学家认为过去日本经济上升局面一般继续一年半左右，估计这次也不会长久。
