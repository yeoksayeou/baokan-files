Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, 2nd. Reports were made by representatives of various countries and international organizations at the afternoon session of the first day (August 1) of the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

The countries and organizations that made reports included: the German Democratic Republic, Ghana, India, Romania, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the European Committee Against Nuclear Armaments, the International Organization of Journalists, and the World Federation of Trade Unions. All speakers agreed that holding the conference against atomic and hydrogen bombs in Hiroshima, the first city in the world to suffer an atomic bomb attack, was of particular significance, and that the conference's call to "not let the Hiroshima tragedy happen again" was all the more powerful.

Professor Herbert Gute, Mayor of Dresden in the German Democratic Republic, said that the German people are vigilant about the revival of militarism, and that the German people, who have fresh memories of the tragedy of World War II, are particularly strongly aware of the need to unite with the Japanese people who hope to ban nuclear weapons.

Ghanaian representative Quaye condemned France's planned atomic bomb test in the Sahara at the conference, and expressed the determination of the Ghanaian people to fight against atomic and hydrogen bombs. Lee Shim-chul, representative of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, reported on how the United States and the Syngman Rhee group were turning South Korea into a nuclear weapons base, as the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was unable to attend the conference because the Kishi Nobusuke government refused to issue visas. He also drew the attention of the conference to the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, and its plan to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Dr. Stanciu Stoian of Romania suggested including the issue of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central Europe, the Balkans, and the Asia-Pacific region on the agenda. Nguyen Do Dinh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reported on how the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group are now turning South Vietnam into a nuclear weapons base, and suggested that the conference demand that they abide by international agreements, including the Geneva Accords.

The last speaker was Ibrahim Zakaria, Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He mentioned the efforts made by the WFTU to resolve the German question peacefully, and expressed deep concern about the situation in the Far East. He pointed out that the military bases on Okinawa Island are already equipped with nuclear weapons; and that the danger of arming Japan with nuclear weapons is growing. He warned people to guard against the revival of Japanese militarism, and he emphasized that peace can be maintained if the forces of the working class and peace-loving people all over the world unite.

    不许广岛惨剧重演！
    各国代表在禁止氢弹大会发言
    新华社2日讯　广岛消息：在第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会第一天（1日）会议的下午会议上，各国和各国际组织的代表在会上作了报告。
    作报告的国家和组织包括：德意志民主共和国、加纳、印度、罗马尼亚、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、欧洲反对核军备委员会、国际新闻工作者协会和世界工会联合会。所有的发言者一致认为，在世界上第一个遭受原子弹轰炸的广岛举行禁止原子弹氢弹大会，有着特别重大的意义，这样，会议呼吁“不让广岛惨剧重演”，就更有力量了。
    德意志民主共和国德累斯顿市长赫伯特·古特教授说，德国人民警惕着军国主义的复活，对第二次世界大战的悲剧记忆犹新的德国人民特别强烈地意识到要同希望禁止核武器的日本人民团结一致。
    加纳代表夸耶在大会上谴责法国打算在撒哈拉进行的原子弹试验，他表达了加纳人民为反对原子弹和氢弹而进行斗争的决心。旅日朝鲜人总联合会的李心哲代表因为岸信介政府拒发签证而未能参加大会的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团，报告了美国和李承晚集团如何把南朝鲜变成核武器基地的情况，并提请大会注意岸信介政府阻挠旅日朝侨回国的政策，以及它要修改日美“安全条约”的计划。罗马尼亚的斯坦裘·斯托扬博士建议把关于在中欧、巴尔干和亚洲太平洋地区建立无核武器地区的问题列入议程。越南民主共和国的阮度庭报告了美国和吴庭艳集团现在如何把南越变成核武器基地的情况，并且建议大会要求它们遵守包括日内瓦协议在内的国际协议。
    最后一个发言的是世界工会联合会书记处书记易卜拉欣·扎卡里亚。他提到世界工联为和平解决德国问题所作的努力，并且表示对远东局势深切关心。他指出，冲绳岛的军事基地已经装备着核武器；而且用核武器武装日本的危险性已愈来愈大。他警告人们提防日本军国主义的复活，他强调指出，如果全世界工人阶级和爱好和平的人民的力量团结起来，和平是可以保持的。（附图片）
