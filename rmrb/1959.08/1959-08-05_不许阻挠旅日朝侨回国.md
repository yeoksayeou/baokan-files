No Obstruction of Korean Residents in Japan Returning to Their Country
*People's Daily* Commentator

On August 6th, the International Committee of the Red Cross will hold a regular plenary meeting to discuss the attitude it should take on the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to their country. Because the Nobusuke Kishi government, under the pretext of having to wait for the "agreement" of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has repeatedly delayed signing the agreement reached on June 24th between the delegations of the Red Cross Societies of North Korea and Japan on the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to their country, this meeting of the International Committee of the Red Cross has attracted people's attention.

The Nobusuke Kishi government had made a decision to repatriate Korean residents, and the former Chief Cabinet Secretary, Akagi, publicly stated that this decision would "never waver." However, due to the constant pressure from the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, the Nobusuke Kishi government has been obstructing the negotiations held in Geneva by the representatives of the Red Cross Societies of North Korea and Japan; it has been delaying signing the agreement reached by both parties. The agreement reached by both parties did not stipulate that the signing required the "agreement" of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Nobusuke Kishi government suddenly created extraneous issues, unreasonably and deliberately entangling the attitude of the International Committee of the Red Cross on the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to their country with the signing of the agreement by North Korea and Japan. This is clearly succumbing to the will of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, attempting to obstruct the return of Korean residents to their country, and shifting the responsibility to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Recently, the Nobusuke Kishi government's clumsy actions have become even more obvious. On August 1st, the Nobusuke Kishi government agreed to resume "Japan-South Korea talks" with the Syngman Rhee clique. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also openly denied on July 12th the past crimes of Japanese militarists who kidnapped the Korean people, saying that "the Koreans currently in Japan are residing in Japan of their own will" and that "not a single person has been left here against their own will." This blatantly shows that the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to go back on its promises and deprive Korean residents of their right to return to their country.

However, for the International Committee of the Red Cross, it should, in the spirit of impartiality and humanitarianism, actively assist and promote the early realization of the wish of Korean residents in Japan to return to their country. It is worth noting that while the United States is putting pressure on the Nobusuke Kishi government, it is attempting to interfere in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross. According to the Associated Press, "The United States Permanent Mission in Geneva has been closely monitoring the negotiations between Japan and North Korea (on the issue of Korean residents in Japan) and has been in contact with the International Committee of the Red Cross while the International Committee of the Red Cross is currently studying this repatriation agreement." U.S. Secretary of State Herter, who attended the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, discussed the issue of Korean residents in Japan with the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Boissier, on July 21st. Kim Hwal-ran, the "Vice President of the South Korean Red Cross Society," who was sent to Geneva by the Syngman Rhee clique to engage in sabotage activities, also met with Boissier on July 29th. Boissier later told reporters that the International Committee of the Red Cross had not yet made any decision on the issue of the agreement on Korean residents in Japan returning to their country, but was studying the agreement. It seems that the International Committee of the Red Cross has been slow to express its attitude precisely because it has been influenced by forces that are plotting to obstruct the return of Korean residents in Japan. However, earlier, the leaders and official documents of the International Committee of the Red Cross had clearly stated that it would never be influenced by the political pressure of obstructers and that it would participate in resolving the issue of Korean residents in Japan returning to their country from a humanitarian standpoint. This attitude is welcome.

Hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan are preparing to leave, many of whom have resigned from their jobs and disposed of their property, and the homeland of the Korean people—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—has also made preparations in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation to welcome them back. The Nobusuke Kishi government's act of delaying the signing of the agreement has aroused their anger and protest. Since the beginning of July, Korean residents in Japan have held demonstrations and rallies in 128 cities in Japan, with the participation of millions of people, to protest the Nobusuke Kishi government's delay in signing the agreement. At the same time, the Japan Aid Association for the Repatriation of Korean Residents in Japan, composed of people from all walks of life in Japan, in addition to issuing a statement demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government immediately sign the agreement, also launched a nationwide unified action on July 23rd to assist Korean residents in realizing their wish to return to their country as soon as possible. The legitimate wishes and rights of hundreds of thousands of Korean residents in Japan to return to their country must not be obstructed or deprived. The International Committee of the Red Cross has no reason not to make a fair decision that is in line with humanitarian principles.

    不许阻挠旅日朝侨回国
    本报评论员
    8月6日，红十字国际委员会将举行定期全体会议，讨论在旅日朝侨回国问题上应采取的态度问题。由于岸信介政府以所谓必须等待红十字国际委员会的“同意”为借口，一再拖延签署朝日两国红十字会代表团于6月24日就旅日朝侨回国问题达成的协议，因此，红十字国际委员会这次会议受到人们的注意。
    岸信介政府曾经作出过遣返朝侨的决定，前任内阁官房长官赤城并公开表示这个决定“决不动摇”。但是，由于美国和李承晚集团不断施加压力，岸信介政府对于朝日两国红十字会代表在日内瓦举行的谈判，一直采取阻挠态度；对双方所达成的协议，一直拖延不肯签字。在双方达成的协议中，根本没有规定要以红十字国际委员会的“同意”才能签字，岸信介政府忽然节外生枝，把红十字国际委员会对旅日朝侨回国问题的态度同朝日双方签署协议的事情毫无道理地故意纠结在一起，显然是屈从美国和李承晚集团的意志，企图阻挠朝侨回国，并把责任推到红十字国际委员会身上。最近，岸信介政府的这种拙劣做法更加明显了。8月1日，岸信介政府同意和李承晚集团恢复“日韩谈判”。日本外务省并在7月12日公然抵赖过去日本军国主义者劫走朝鲜人民的罪行，说什么“目前在日本的朝鲜人都是根据自己的意志居住在日本的”，“没有一个违反本人意志而被留在这里的人”。这露骨地表明岸信介政府企图自食诺言，剥夺朝侨回国的权利。
    不过对红十字国际委员会来说，它应该本着公正的立场和人道主义精神，积极协助和促使旅日朝侨早日实现回国的愿望的。值得注意的是，美国在向岸信介政府施加压力的同时，正在企图干涉红十字国际委员会的工作。据美联社透露：“美国在日内瓦的常驻代表团一直密切注视着日本和朝鲜（关于旅日朝侨问题）的谈判，并且在目前红十字国际委员会研究这项遣侨协议期间一直同红十字国际委员会保持联系。”出席日内瓦外长会议的美国国务卿赫脱，7月21日同红十字国际委员会主席布瓦西埃讨论了有关旅日朝侨的问题。李承晚集团派去日内瓦从事阴谋破坏活动的南朝鲜“红十字会副会长”金活兰，也在7月29日会见了布瓦西埃。布瓦西埃后来对记者发表谈话说，红十字国际委员会对旅日朝侨回国的协议问题还没有作出任何决定，但是正在研究协议。看来，红十字国际委员会所以迟迟不表明态度，正是由于受到阴谋阻挠旅日朝侨回国的势力的影响。不过，在早些时候，红十字国际委员会的领导人和正式文件都曾明确地表示过，它决不会受阻挠者的政治压力的影响，并表示它会从人道主义出发参与解决旅日朝侨回国问题。这种态度是值得欢迎的。
    几十万旅日朝侨正整装待发，他们当中有许多人都已辞去职业，处理了财物，而朝鲜人民的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，也已从衣食住各方面作了迎接他们回国的准备。岸信介政府拖延签署协议的行为，引起了他们的愤怒和抗议。从7月初以来，旅日朝侨为抗议岸信介政府拖延签署协议，在日本一百二十八个城市举行了先后计有上百万人参加的示威集会。同时，日本各界组成的旅日朝侨归国协助会，除发表声明要求岸信介政府立即签署协议外，还在7月23日发动了一个全国性统一行动，协助朝侨早日实现回国愿望。几十万旅日朝侨回国的正当愿望和权利，是不容许阻挠和剥夺的。红十字国际委员会是没有任何理由不作出公正和符合人道主义原则的决定的。
