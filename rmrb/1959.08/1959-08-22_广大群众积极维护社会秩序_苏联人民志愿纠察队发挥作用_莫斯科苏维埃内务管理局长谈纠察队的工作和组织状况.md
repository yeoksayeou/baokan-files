Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 21st - Abramov, Director of the Moscow City Soviet Internal Affairs Bureau, recently spoke with our reporter and a group of other foreign journalists about the significance, role, and organizational structure of the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads, saying: Organizing the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads is a major way to attract the broad masses to participate in ensuring social order. This is a measure to transfer the functions of state organs to the responsibility of the general public. The People's Volunteer Public Order Squads are a voluntary organization formed during the period of comprehensively building communism, where the people and social organizations use their strength to manage social order and prevent criminal behavior.

The People's Volunteer Public Order Squads emerged in a situation where crime has rapidly decreased in Soviet society. Taking Moscow as an example, the number of criminal cases now is 57% less than before the war. Not only has the number of cases greatly decreased, but the nature of criminal behavior has also changed. In the past five years, there have been no serious cases of homicide or robbery in Moscow. Criminal behavior is mainly hooliganism and failure to comply with social order after drinking. With the sharp decline in crime, it is possible to transfer some of the functions of state organs in this area to social organizations. After the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads were organized, the number of police officers has been reduced. Personnel who originally worked as police officers have been transferred to production posts.

The People's Volunteer Public Order Squads maintain close contact with the Public Security Bureau when carrying out activities to maintain social order. However, the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads are by no means subordinate to the Public Security Bureau; they are independent social organizations of the people. This is completely different from the organizations that assisted the Public Security Bureau in the past.

The People's Volunteer Public Order Squads were first initiated by factory workers in Leningrad in November 1958. Afterwards, they quickly spread throughout the country. In March of this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers specifically issued a decision to support this initiative of the working masses. Moscow already has 1,300 People's Volunteer Public Order Squads, with varying numbers of people in each team, some with only three or five people. Participation in the People's Public Order Squad is voluntary. The individual submits an application, which is discussed by the collective of the enterprise or institution. If deemed qualified, they are recommended. Members of the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads must be exemplary in all aspects.

The organizational forms of the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads vary depending on local conditions. Generally, a headquarters is established in each district, with commanders and deputy commanders, all of whom are elected by all members at a public meeting. For example, the command headquarters of the Kiev district is composed of nineteen people, and the commander elected is the secretary of the Party organization of a factory. Other personnel are representatives of various enterprises and social organizations. The organization of other districts is roughly the same. Members of the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads carry identification cards and badges, but no weapons. Working hours are all in their spare time.

Many examples prove that the work of the squads is very effective and can indeed assume the functions transferred from state organs. Taking Moscow as an example, the May Day parade, many exhibitions, and public gatherings this year were maintained by members of the People's Volunteer Public Order Squads instead of the police, and they did a good job.

The People's Public Order Squads often use persuasion and education methods. Once, a member encountered a foreman from a factory in a liquor store who was drinking heavily. The member went to persuade him to stop drinking like that. The words of the squad member were effective, and the foreman immediately left the liquor store. Another example: an eighteen-year-old young worker used abusive language to scold others. When the squad member encountered this, he notified the factory of his behavior. The factory held a collective meeting to criticize and educate him. After inspection, this young man no longer behaved in this way.

Abramov finally pointed out that the state security organs have seen that great progress has been made in maintaining social order and preventing crime by relying on the active actions of the working masses.

    苏联人民志愿纠察队发挥作用
    莫斯科苏维埃内务管理局长谈纠察队的工作和组织状况
    新华社莫斯科21日电　莫斯科市苏维埃内务管理局局长阿布拉莫夫，最近和本社记者以及其他一批外国记者谈有关人民志愿纠察队的意义、作用和组织状况说：组织人民志愿纠察队是吸引广大群众参加保障社会秩序的一种主要方式。这是将国家机关的职能转移给社会公众担负的一项措施。人民志愿纠察队是在全面开展共产主义建设时期人民和社会组织运用自己的力量来管理社会秩序、防止犯罪行为的一种志愿组织。
    人民志愿纠察队是犯罪现象在苏联社会中已迅速减少的情况下产生的。以莫斯科市为例，现在的犯罪案件比战前减少了57％。不仅案件的数量大大减少了，而且犯罪行为的性质也改变了。五年来，莫斯科市没有发生过性质严重的凶杀、抢劫等案件。犯罪现象主要是一些流氓行为和酗酒后不遵守社会秩序等。在犯罪现象急剧减少的情况下，就有可能将一部分国家机关在这方面的职能交由社会组织来担任。组织了人民志愿纠察队以后，民警的数目已经减少。原来担任民警工作的人员转移到生产岗位上去了。
    人民志愿纠察队在执行维护社会秩序方面的活动时同民警局有密切联系。但人民志愿纠察队绝不从属于民警局，它是独立的人民群众的社会组织。这和过去协助民警局工作的组织完全不同。
    人民志愿纠察队是1958年11月在列宁格勒首先由工厂工人发起组织的。以后立刻在各地迅速推广。今年3月，苏共中央和部长会议专门发布了决定，支持劳动群众的这一倡议。莫斯科已经有一千三百个人民志愿纠察队，各队的人数不等，有的只有三、五个人。参加人民纠察队是志愿的。本人提出申请，经企业和机关的集体讨论，如认为合格，就予以推荐。人民志愿纠察队队员必须是各方面都能起模范作用的人。
    各地的人民志愿纠察队因各地情况不同，组织的形式也不完全一样。一般是在各区成立指挥部，有指挥员和副指挥员，他们都由全体队员在公开会议上选出。例如基辅区的指挥部由十九个人组成，指挥员选的是一家工厂的党组织书记，其他人员是各个企业和社会团体的代表。指挥部下设支队。其他区的组织也大体相同。人民志愿纠察队队员带有证件和证章，但没有武器。工作时间都是在业余时间。
    有许多例子证明纠察队的工作很有成效，确乎能够负担起国家机关转移来的职能。以莫斯科为例，今年五一游行、许多展览会和公共集会都是由人民志愿纠察队队员代替民警维持秩序的，而且他们工作的满不错。
    人民纠察队经常采用说服和教育方法。有一次一个队员在一家冷酒店遇到一个工厂的工长，他在那里喝得很厉害。队员就前去劝止他，要他不要这样喝。纠察队员的话发生了效力，工长立刻离开了冷酒店。还有一个例子：有一个十八岁的青年工人用恶言谩骂别人，纠察队员遇到了，把他的行为通知工厂，工厂集体开会对他进行批评教育，以后检查，这个青年再没有这种行为了。
    阿布拉莫夫最后指出，国家治安机关已经看到，依靠劳动群众的积极行动来维护社会秩序、预防犯罪的工作大有进展。
