Preparing Abundant Fodder for Pigs
    The Experience of Tong'erbu Commune in Using Silage to Raise Pigs
    By Our Correspondents Gao Fang and Yang Shaoshan
    In developing pig raising production, satisfactorily resolving the feed problem is a crucial key to achieving rapid development. Tong'erbu People's Commune in Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, has fully explored and utilized natural feed and silage to raise pigs. This year, the commune's pigs are both numerous and fat, setting an example of using silage to raise pigs on a large scale. By July 20, the commune had developed its pig population to 42,585, an increase of 62% compared to the end of last year. On August 6, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting here to promote the commune's experience to all counties.

    Correct Understanding, Introducing Experiences
    Tong'erbu Commune is a large commune with more than 20,000 households located on the river plains of the Taizi River, Hun River, and Beisha River. For many years, many commune members have had experience in using wild feed to raise pigs. This year, after correctly implementing the policy of developing pig production through combining public and private efforts, pig raising production has greatly developed. As the number of pigs increased by the thousands, feed became insufficient. This year, the commune plans to develop its pig population to more than 80,000, but only enough feed grain was reserved last year for 26,000 pigs. Therefore, in April of this year, the commune Party committee issued a call to use silage extensively for pig raising, requiring each pig to have 2,000 jin of silage. However, at this time, some people believed that "using silage to raise pigs can be used to supplement shortages, but it is not suitable as the main food for pigs," and others believed that "sows cannot conceive piglets if they eat green feed." In order to resolve these ideological concerns of cadres and commune members, the commune held an on-site meeting in the Luojiawozi Brigade, which had rich experience in using silage to feed pigs, and promoted the brigade's successful experience in using silage to raise pigs. At the same time, the vivid story of provincial pig-raising model worker Aunt Tong, who used silage to raise four large fat pigs a year, was introduced; the commune Party committee also continuously carried out publicity at various meetings, and the work of collecting and ensiling feed was widely carried out throughout the commune.

    Everyone Mobilized, Every Household Collects
    Tong'erbu Commune is a plain commune along the river, and wild feed is not as abundant as in mountainous areas, but it is still very rich. The problem is that many wild feeds grow in the fields and are very seasonal, and collecting feed often conflicts with agricultural production. In order to solve this contradiction, the commune Party committee proposed launching a mass movement of "everyone mobilized, every household collects." In addition to organizing people participating in agricultural labor to collect a large amount of green feed whenever they returned from working in the fields, they also mobilized a large number of women, the elderly, and elementary school students to collect feed during the busy farming season. Because collective pig farms adopted the method of paying cash for purchases, everyone was very enthusiastic about collecting feed. Many elementary school students formed groups of three or five and went out to collect with baskets after school. Because Liren Production Brigade implemented this method, there are now more than 400 silage pits and more than 14 million jin of silage in the whole commune. Many commune member families have also stored a lot of feed by adopting methods such as dry storage or fermentation in vats, and many commune members have raised four or five pigs by using green feed.

    Continuous Throughout the Year, Storage in Every Season
    Now, the collection and silage of feed for pig raising in Tong'erbu Commune is no longer restricted by any season, and it can be stored and utilized all year round. They put forward the slogan of "seize the green in spring, seize the storage in summer, seize the yellow in autumn, and seize the threshing ground in winter," storing feed every season and feeding it every day to ensure that pigs have sufficient "granaries." In spring, after the green grass sprouts, iron roots, elm leaves, and elm money can be collected to feed pigs. Then, in late spring and early summer, shepherd's purse, fuzi seedlings, plantain, willow shoots, lamb's quarters, changzi and other wild vegetables will also grow one after another. In addition to collecting and feeding them fresh, they can also be extensively ensiled and stored for winter feed. Among them, fuzi seedlings have the largest output, with a growing period of more than three months, and they are also highly nutritious. The masses call them "second-class soybean cake." In autumn, various wild grasses and vegetable seeds are mature, which is even better feed for pigs. In winter, a large amount of agricultural by-products such as grain husks left over from threshing are stored in cellars, ground, boiled, and then fed to pigs, which is not much different from refined feed. Because this commune has found the experience of feeding pigs with green feed and widely mobilized commune members to collect and store it throughout the year, it has solved the feed problem for the large-scale development of pig raising. This spring, the state transferred more than 220,000 jin of refined feed to them from Anshan, and many production teams did not want it. They said: Using the money to buy refined feed to purchase green feed collected by commune members can raise more pigs. (Attached Picture)

    为猪准备丰富的粮草
    佟贰卜公社利用青贮饲料养猪的经验
    本报记者　高方　杨绍山
    在发展养猪生产中，圆满解决饲料问题，是获得迅速发展的一个重要关键。辽宁省辽阳市佟贰卜人民公社充分挖掘利用天然饲料和青贮饲料养猪，全社今年养的猪又多又肥，树立了利用青贮饲料大量养猪的榜样。到7月20日，这个社的猪已发展到四万二千五百八十五头，比去年年底增加了62％。中共辽宁省委8月6日在这里召开了现场会议，向各县推广这个社的经验。
    端正认识，介绍经验
    佟贰卜公社在太子河、浑河、北沙河的河滨平原，是一个二万多户的大社。许多社员多少年来便有利用野生饲料养猪的经验。今年公社经过正确贯彻公私并举的发展养猪生产方针以后，养猪生产大大发展。随着猪只成千上万头的增加，饲料便显得不够了。今年全社生猪计划发展到八万多头，但是去年只按二万六千头留的饲料粮。于是公社党委在今年4月提出了大量利用青贮饲料养猪的号召，要求为每头猪青贮饲料二千斤。但是这时有一些人认为“利用青贮饲料养猪接长补短还可以，当作猪的主食可不行”，还有的认为“母猪吃青饲料怀不住小猪”。为了解决干部和社员这些思想顾虑，公社便在利用青贮饲料喂猪经验丰富的罗家卧子大队召开了现场会议，推广了这个大队用青贮饲料养猪的成功经验，同时介绍了省养猪模范佟大娘利用青贮饲料一年养四头大肥猪的生动事迹；公社党委还在各种会议上不断进行宣传，采集和青贮饲料的工作就在全社广泛开展起来了。
    人人动手，户户采集
    佟贰卜公社是一个沿河的平原公社，野生饲料不如山区那样多，但是也很丰富。问题是很多野生饲料都生长在田地里，季节性很强，采集饲料和农业生产往往挤在一起。为了解决这个矛盾，公社党委提出了开展“人人动手，户户采集”的全民运动。除组织参加农业劳动的人，利用下地回来的时间随时采集了大量青饲料以外，他们还在农忙时期大量发动妇女、老年人、小学生来采集饲料。由于集体养猪场采取现钱收买的办法，大家采集饲料的积极性很高。许多小学生放学以后就三五成群地拿起筐篓四出采集。里仁生产大队由于实行了这种办法，现在全社青贮饲料已有四百多窖，一千四百多万斤。许多社员家庭也采取干贮或缸沤等办法，贮藏了很多饲料，不少社员利用青饲料养了四、五头猪。
    常年不断，季季贮藏
    现在佟贰卜公社采集和青贮饲料养猪已不受任何季节的限制，一年四季都可以贮藏利用。他们提出了“春抓青、夏抓藏、秋抓黄、入冬抓打场”的口号，季季贮，天天喂，保证猪有充足的“粮库”。春天从青草发芽以后，就可采集钢铁根、榆树叶和榆树钱喂猪。接着，春末夏初曲末菜、芙子苗、车轮菜、柳蒿、灰菜、场子等野菜，也都陆续生长起来了，除现采现喂以外，还可以大量进行青贮，留做越冬饲料。其中芙子苗产量最大，生长期三个多月，营养也高，群众叫做“二等豆饼”。到了秋天，各种野草、野菜籽都成熟了，这更是喂猪的好饲料。入冬，把打场剩下来的大量谷壳等农业副产物窖藏起来，磨碎、煮沸后喂猪，比精饲料不差多少。这个社，由于摸到了青饲料喂猪的经验，广泛发动社员一年四季进行采集贮藏，解决了大量发展养猪的饲料问题，今年春天，国家从鞍山给他们调拨二十二万多斤精料，有很多生产队都没有要。他们说：把买精饲料的钱用来收买社员采集的青饲料，可以饲养更多的猪。（附图片）
