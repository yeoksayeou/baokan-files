Talking About Reasonableness

　　Recently, I have often heard the word "reasonable" in my work: production measures should be "reasonable"; labor arrangements should be "reasonable"; contracting production to groups or households should be "reasonable"; labor remuneration should be "reasonable," and so on. What is "reasonable"? It means conforming to the laws of objective things. Engels said, "...what is necessary is, in the final analysis, also something reasonable," which is what it means. Today we say that production measures should be "reasonable," what "reason" should they conform to? They should "conform" to the "reason" of the laws of crop growth; labor remuneration should be "reasonable," what "reason" should it conform to? It should "conform" to the "reason" of the law of distribution according to labor. All work can only succeed if it is "reasonable"; it will fail if it is not "reasonable."

　　However, in our work, we often see some comrades who do not pay much attention to "reason," and just bury themselves in hard work. In their minds, work seems to have no "reason" at all, just do it, so it is inevitable to take more detours and encounter more setbacks in the work. Therefore, it is very important to pay attention to "reason" in work.

　　To talk about "reason," we must understand "reason." "Reason" is the law, where does the law exist? The law exists in objective things. However, although the law exists in things, it is not floating on the surface of things after all.

　　Finding "reason" is much more difficult than talking about "reason" and understanding "reason." Today, many comrades are still troubled by knowing that there is reason, but not knowing how to find it. How to find "reason"? The method of finding "reason" is analysis. After conducting in-depth and detailed analysis of complex and diverse things, we can find its regularity. Marx and Engels found the laws of the development of human society as a result of conducting in-depth analysis of human history; similarly, Chairman Mao found the laws of the Chinese revolution as a result of conducting in-depth analysis of the Chinese social situation. Analysis requires using our brains. The Party often teaches us to use our brains, be good at thinking, learn methods of analyzing things, and develop the habit of analysis. To use our brains, we must be guided by the correct method, what method? The Marxist-Leninist dialectical method. Chairman Mao told us that when transforming experience into law through analysis, we should adopt the method of "discarding the dross and selecting the essence, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other and from the outside to the inside." This is the key to entering the field of analytical research and requires good study. Of course, to do this, we must also master rich factual materials. Moreover, the "reason" found in this way is not absolute, it must also be tested by practice. After obtaining new factual materials through practice, and conducting further analysis on this basis, the "reason" will be more perfect. Therefore, finding "reason" is a continuous process of understanding and analysis.

　　Finding "reason" is an arduous task, but as long as we do not avoid hardships and often conduct in-depth and detailed research and analysis of things, "reason" can be found. If we can find "reason," our work will have a basis to follow, and we can "reasonably" do our work well.

### 谈合理

　　谈合理
    最近在工作中常常听到“合理”这个词儿：生产措施要“合理”；劳力安排要“合理”；包工包产要“合理”；劳动报酬要“合理”等等。所谓“合理”，就是合乎客观事物的规律性。恩格斯说：“……必然的东西，归根到底总也是合理的东西”，指的也就是这个意思。今天我们说生产措施要“合理”，“合”什么“理”？
  “合”农作物生长规律之“理”；劳动报酬要“合理”，“合”什么“理”？“合”按劳分配规律之“理”。一切工作只有“合理”才能成功；不“合理”就会失败。
    然而在我们的工作中，还常常看到有的同志不大讲究“理”，只是埋头苦干。在他的心目中，工作好像就没个“理”，干就是了，因而在工作中就免不了多走点弯路，多碰点钉子。所以，在工作中讲究“理”是很重要的。
    要讲“理”，就得明“理”。“理”是规律，规律存在于何处？规律就存在于客观事物之中。但是，规律虽然存在于事物之中，它毕竟还不是浮在事物的表面。
    寻“理”，要比讲“理”、明“理”困难得多。如今有许多同志还苦于知其有理，而不得其理。怎样寻“理”？寻“理”的方法就是分析，对于纷纭复杂的事物进行深入细致的分析之后，就可以找出它的规律性。马克思、恩格斯找到人类社会发展的规律，就是对人类历史进行了深入的分析之后的结果；同样，毛主席找到中国革命的规律，也是对中国社会状况进行了深入的分析之后的结果。分析是要用脑子的，党经常教导我们要开动脑筋，善于思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。开动脑筋，要用正确的方法为向导，什么方法？马克思主义的唯物辩证方法。毛主席告诉我们，在通过分析把经验上升为规律时，要采取“去粗取精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里”的方法。这是从事分析研究的入门之钥，需要很好的学习。当然，要这样做还得掌握丰富的事实材料。而且，这样做了之后寻得的“理”也不是绝对的，它还要经过实践的考验。经过实践获得新的事实材料，在这个基础上再作进一步的分析，“理”就会更加完善。所以寻“理”是个不断认识、不断分析的过程。
    寻“理”是件艰苦的工作，但是只要我们不避艰苦，经常对事物进行深入、细致的研究分析，“理”就可以寻得。能够寻得“理”，我们的工作就有了依循，就可以“合理”地把工作做好。
