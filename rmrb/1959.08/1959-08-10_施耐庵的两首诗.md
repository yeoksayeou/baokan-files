Two Poems by Shi Nai'an
Ding Li

Recently, I saw a copy of "Ruhua Shi Chao" (Poems as Spoken Language) in the Capital Library. The author was Zhu Junsheng, courtesy name Fengqi, a native of Yuanhe (now Wuxian County, Jiangsu). He was a Juren (successful candidate in the provincial imperial examination) in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty and wrote many books throughout his life. This book was preserved as an original manuscript by his descendants and published by Guangyi Book Bureau in the tenth year of the Republic of China. The whole book is mostly copied from ancient notes and poetry talks, some of the more popular poems, so it is called "Ruhua Shi Chao".

Among them, two poems in the form of regulated verse (律诗) by Shi Nai'an are copied, titled "After Completing *Water Margin*":

　　The Peaceful Emperor sits in the center,
　　Upright and cautious officials are scattered throughout the four seas.
　　Only fat sheep are seen comforting the elders,
　　No neighing horses stir generals.
　　We inherit ritual and music as our family tradition,
　　I want to express my emotions through songs.
　　I will not imitate the Southeast where there is no day of taboo,
　　But chant the Northwest where there are floating clouds＊.

　　Generally, human life is just a mound of earth,
　　How many people can be equal in a hundred years.
　　Plowing is more stable than a royal carriage,
　　Basking in the sun is warmer than fur coat.
　　Cao Zhi's great talent was only nicknamed a tiger,
　　Zhuang Zhou’s detachment was thought of as an ox.
　　In the cold night, slightly drunk, I shake my soft brush,
　　If the words are not surprising, then I'll stop.

Original note: "Northwest has floating clouds" is a poem by Emperor Wen of Wei.

Shi Nai'an is the author of *Water Margin*, or the one who completed it. There are very few historical materials about him. A few years ago, someone discovered his epitaph in Baiju, Xinghua, along with his tomb and legends about him, but some people still do not believe it. Even now, some *Water Margin* researchers doubt that Shi Nai'an wrote *Water Margin*. Despite the fact that the early versions were titled "Shi Nai'an's Original" and "Shi Nai'an's Compiled Works," they still don't believe it.

Now that these two poems by Shi Nai'an have been discovered, some people may still doubt whether they were really written by him. But I believe that Shi Nai'an was the compiler of *Water Margin*, and the title of these two poems, "After Completing *Water Margin*", also proves that he was indeed the author of *Water Margin*.

The poems are not very poetic, but the style is consistent with many poems in *Water Margin*. Judging from the content, the first poem expresses the hope for a peaceful and prosperous age without war; it can also be said to be his "ideal." The second poem describes the meaning of living in poverty and writing books. "If the words are not surprising, then I'll stop" shows the author's humble mood after completing *Water Margin*. I think Zhu Junsheng must have copied these two poems from some source, but unfortunately he did not indicate the source in "Ruhua Shi Chao". In the future, someone will surely find these two poems by Shi Nai'an in the notes and poetry talks of the Yuan and Ming dynasties. I hope that *Water Margin* researchers will pay attention to collecting them, so I will disclose these two poems first for research and reference. If the original materials of these two poems can be found in any book, it will be very helpful for solving the author problem of *Water Margin*.

    施耐庵的两首诗
    丁力
    近在首都图书馆看到一部“如话诗钞”，著录者朱骏声，字丰?，元和（今江苏吴县）人。清道光举人，生平著书甚富。此书由其后人保存原稿，民国十年交广益书局出版。全书大抵是从古代笔记、诗话中抄录一些比较通俗的诗，所以叫做“如话诗钞”。
    其中抄录了施耐庵的两首律诗，题为“成水浒传题后”：
    太平天子当中坐，清慎官员四海分。
    但见肥羊宁父老，不闻嘶马动将军。
    叨承礼乐为家世，欲以讴歌寄快文。
    不学东南无讳日，却吟西北有浮云＊。
    大抵人生土一丘，百年若个得齐头。
    扶犁安稳尊于辇，负曝奇温胜似裘。
    子建高才空号虎，庄生放达以为牛。
    夜寒薄醉摇柔翰，语不惊人也便休。
    原注：“西北有浮云”，魏文帝诗。
    施耐庵是“水浒传”的作者，或者说是最后的完成者。关于他的历史材料很少，前几年有人在兴化白驹发现了他的墓志，并有他的坟墓以及有关他的传说，但也还有人不信。直到现在，还有的“水浒”研究者，对施耐庵作“水浒”是怀疑的。尽管早期的版本上题署“施耐庵的本”、“施耐庵集撰”，他们还是不信。
    现在发现了施耐庵这两首诗，也许还会有人怀疑是否真是他作的。但我相信施耐庵是“水浒传”的撰集人，这两首诗的题目叫“成水浒传题后”，也可以证明他的的确确是“水浒传”的作者。
    诗写并不是很有诗味，但风格却与“水浒传”中许多诗是一致的。就其内容来看，前一首，是希望有太平盛世、干戈不兴；也可以说是他的一种“理想”吧。后一首诗，是写安贫著书的意思。“语不惊人也便休”，表现了作者完成水浒后的自谦心情。我想朱骏声抄录这两首诗必有所本，可惜他在“如话诗钞”中没有注明出处。将来一定会有人在元、明的笔记、诗话中，还能发现施耐庵这两首诗的。我希望水浒研究者注意搜集，故先将这两首诗披露，以供研究、参考。如果找到了这两首诗的原始材料在什么书中，对解决水浒的作者问题是非常有帮助的。
