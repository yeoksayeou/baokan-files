    Visiting the Creator of the "Wrapped Pot Stove"
    By our staff reporter Wu Jianmin
    Song Jiming, a cook from a certain PLA unit stationed in Harbin, successfully created a suction-type "wrapped pot stove" last year, reducing the daily coal consumption of the stove used to feed 500 people from more than 1,000 jin to just over 200 jin.
    This outstanding creation has attracted batches of visitors from factories, enterprises, schools, and even from other counties and provinces. Song Jiming himself has been invited several times to coal conservation conferences in Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City to introduce his experience, give demonstration performances, or to guide the modification of stoves at factories, government offices, and schools. Currently, more than 2,000 collective canteens with over 100 people in Harbin City alone have promoted the "wrapped pot stove."
    We recently visited Song Jiming. He was wearing a white work uniform, preparing lunch for the more than 250 comrades in his unit in a clean and spacious kitchen. One moment he was using a poker to stir the ashes, and the next he was opening the stove door to add a small shovel of coal. We curiously peered into the mysteries of the stove. We saw the white-hot flames darting upwards, constantly raising their heads at the edge of the stove door, spraying back along both sides of the pot, lingering and wrapping around the entire bottom and belly of the pot. At a glance, it was clear where the "wrapped pot stove" got its name.
    Song Jiming explained the wonders of the "wrapped pot stove" to us in detail. Its most special feature is that the stove chamber is pot-shaped, and the chamber itself is very small. The distance between the back of the chamber and the belly of the pot is so narrow that even a fist cannot fit through. The fire grate is like a dustpan, low in the back and high near the stove door, which forces the flames to rise from the front of the pot, then wrap around the bottom and belly of the pot, and then head towards the smoke outlet in the back. According to the appraisal and analysis of the Boiler Teaching and Research Section of Harbin Institute of Technology, the structure of the wrapped pot stove allows the coal to burn completely, and the flue gas stays in the stove for a long time, quickly transferring heat to the entire pot, so the flames are even, the firepower is strong, and coal consumption is low. Actual measurements have shown that the combustion heat utilization rate of the wrapped pot stove is nearly twice that of the old stove.
    While talking to us, Song Jiming evenly added a small shovel of coal to the stove every few minutes. He explained to us: With a good stove, you must also burn it well in order to save coal. Adding coal frequently, in small amounts, quickly, and evenly, will ensure that the coal is neither too thick to burn thoroughly, nor too thin and blown away by the wind, wasting coal.
    As we talked, a large pot of rice was cooked. He told us: It generally takes only forty minutes from boiling a pot of water to adding the rice and cooking it into rice. Once one part of the wrapped pot stove boils when boiling water or cooking rice, the entire pot boils immediately; unlike ordinary stoves, which boil from the edges first and then slowly spread towards the center. Therefore, it is four to fifty minutes faster than ordinary stoves to cook rice (from putting in cold water to cooking into rice). (Attached picture)

    访“包锅灶”创造者
    本报记者　吴建民
    解放军驻哈尔滨某部炊事员宋吉明去年创造成功一种吸风“包锅灶”，使五百人吃饭用的锅灶每天的耗煤量，由一千多斤降低到二百多斤。
    这个出色的创造吸引着一批又一批的参观者。他们来自工厂、企业、学校，甚至外县、外省。宋吉明本人几次被邀请到黑龙江省、哈尔滨市的节约煤炭现场会上去介绍经验，做示范表演，或者被工厂、机关、学校请去指导改造炉灶。现在，仅哈尔滨市就有二千多个百人以上的集体食堂推广了“包锅灶”。
    最近我们访问了宋吉明。他穿着一身白色的工作服，在整洁宽敞的伙房里为所在单位的二百五十多个同志准备午饭。他一会儿用铁钩通通炉灰，一忽儿又打开炉门往灶膛里加一小铲煤炭。我们好奇地窥探着灶膛里的奥秘。只见那呼呼直窜的白热火舌，不断在炉门边高昂起头，顺着锅的两侧直往后面喷去，萦回缭绕，正好缠包着整个锅底和锅腹。一看就知道，这就是“包锅灶”名字的由来。
    宋吉明详细地给我们介绍了“包锅灶”的妙处。它的最特殊的地方是灶膛呈锅形，而且膛身很小，灶膛后部和锅肚的距离窄得连一只拳头都伸不进去；拢火台像簸箕，后面矮，靠灶门处高，这就迫使火苗从锅的前部抬头，然后顺着锅的周围包住锅底和锅腹，再奔向后部出烟口。据哈尔滨工业大学锅炉教研室的鉴定和分析，包锅灶的构造使煤炭得到充分燃烧，而且烟气在灶内停留时间长，又很快传热到整个锅上，所以火苗匀、火力强、耗煤少。经实际测定，包锅灶燃烧热量利用率比旧的锅灶提高将近两倍。
    宋吉明一边跟我们谈着话，一边隔几分钟就向灶膛里均匀地添一小铲煤。他向我们解释说：有了好锅灶，还要烧得好，才能省煤。勤添，添少，添快，并且添得厚薄均匀，就能使煤既不因太厚烧不透，也不因太薄了被风抽跑而费煤。
    说着谈着，一大锅饭就煮熟了。他告诉我们：从一锅水烧开到下米煮成饭一般只要四十分钟。包锅灶烧水或煮饭只要一处开了，立即全锅沸腾；它不像一般锅灶先从边上开，然后缓慢地围向中心开。所以它比一般锅灶烧饭（从放上生水到煮成饭）要快四、五十分钟。（附图片）
