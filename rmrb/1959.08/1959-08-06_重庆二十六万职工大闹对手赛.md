    To seize even greater victories on the industrial front in August, in recent days, more than 260,000 workers in Chongqing's major industries such as steel, coal, machinery, and enamel have been engaging in heated emulation campaigns, worker against worker, leader against leader, striving to learn and promote advanced experiences, and vigorously launching a new upsurge of same-trade competition. As of now, more than 3,500 individual advanced "pacesetters" have been established in several major industries throughout the city, along with a large number of collective advanced "pacesetters." The establishment of these "pacesetters" has provided each factory, mine, workshop, work section, and even every worker with models to learn from and catch up with, further mobilizing the vast number of workers in these industries.
    The converter workshop of the Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant, taking the advanced Ge Laoxi converter workshop of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company as its competition target, exceeded the state plan of 120 tons per day with a new record of 173 tons of steel on the first day of August, an increase of 147% over the average daily output level in July. The original production level of this workshop was very low. In order to surpass their opponent, the workers diligently studied and promoted the other side's advanced experience, greatly improving production. The time it takes them to remove and install a furnace has been shortened from the original seven or eight hours to two or three hours. As a result, the utilization coefficient of this converter workshop in July increased by 32.16% compared to June, and the quality has also improved. Among the six converter workshops in several steel plants in Chongqing, the gap between the advanced production level and the general level was originally very large. For example, in terms of converter life, some furnaces had reached fifty to seventy heats, while most furnaces were still at around thirty heats. After these workshops with basically the same conditions launched a competition in July, the furnace life, steel quality, and converter utilization coefficient have all improved significantly. In the coal system, the No. 16 coal mining team of the No. 3 well of the Chongqing Tianfu Coal Mine originally had the best production. This team mined more than 2,000 tons of coal in January this year, and increased it to more than 8,000 tons in April, setting an example for coal mining teams in thin coal seams throughout the city. The Tianfu Coal Mine established it as a "pacesetter," and all sixty coal mining teams in the mine promoted their experience and launched a competition with it as the target. Now, four coal mining teams and two tunneling teams have reached the level of "red flag work surfaces," and eight teams are close to the level of "red flag work surfaces." The No. 38 team, which had the lowest coal mining level in the mine, has also increased its daily coal output from the original 60 tons to 120 tons.
    The competition between individuals is even more enthusiastic. Workers in many factories and mines have almost all established an opposing target for themselves. No one wants to fall behind. Wherever there are advanced figures and advanced experiences, they rush to learn and catch up. Liu Yinghua, a charging driver at the Daping Furnace Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, created the experience of multi-switch operation for safe charging, breaking the original record of 120 minutes for charging one furnace in 95 minutes, which greatly shortened the smelting time. Zhou Junchao, another charging driver, entered the factory at the same time as Liu Yinghua and learned the technology from the same master, but his production performance was far behind. Therefore, he proposed competition conditions to Liu Yinghua, taking him as a model for his own learning, and actively studied Liu Yinghua's experience of fast charging. As a result, he discovered both Liu Yinghua's advantages and his own operational shortcomings. He tried to overcome these shortcomings and finally caught up with Liu Yinghua. Liu Yinghua, in turn, actively learned from him and improved his operating methods, finally creating a new record of using only 87 minutes to charge 77 buckets of materials. Later, Zhou Junchao created an even higher record of using 70 minutes to charge 69 buckets of materials. In this way, the two fellow apprentices pushed each other's progress.
    After Chongqing City widely launched the emulation campaign to catch up with "pacesetters" on the industrial front, the significant effect is to transform the high yield and high quality of a few people and a few units into "large-scale" bumper harvests. Within ten days after the six converter workshops of several steel plants in Chongqing launched the competition, the quality of steel increased by 5.18% compared to before the competition, and the output steadily increased. In the process of manufacturing converter equipment, the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant originally calculated that there were more than 20 pieces missing according to the plant's existing large equipment. The factory leadership organized 46 pieces of large equipment in the plant to carry out the same type of competition and vigorously promote advanced experience. As a result, the production capacity increased by 58.53%, making up for the shortage of machine tools. In order to strengthen the leadership of the competition, leading organs at the municipal level and most factories and mines have established or improved organizational structures to guide the competition and summarize and promote advanced experiences. Like fighting a war, they have formulated combat plans, sorted out the advanced experiences of some major "pacesetters" according to the key issues in production, and promoted them regularly. In order to set off a new high tide of production competition on a larger scale in August and September, the city also held a representative conference of advanced producers and advanced workers for the first half of 1959.

    重庆二十六万职工大闹对手赛
    本报重庆5日电　为了8月份在工业战线上夺取更大胜利，近几天来，重庆市钢铁、煤炭、机械、搪瓷等几个主要产业的二十六万多名职工兵对兵，将对将，你追我赶，大力学习、推广先进经验，热火朝天地掀起了同工种对手竞赛新高潮。截至目前止，全市几个主要产业分别树立了个人先进“标兵”三千五百多人，同时树立了大批集体先进“标兵”。这些“标兵”树立以后，使各厂矿、车间、工序以至每个工人都有了学习、追赶的榜样，进一步把这些行业的广大职工普遍发动起来了。
    重庆第三钢铁厂转炉车间以重庆钢铁公司先进的葛老溪转炉车间作为自己的竞赛对手，在8月份的第一天，就以日产一百七十三吨钢的新成绩超额完成了日产一百二十吨的国家计划，比7月份平均日产水平提高147％。这个车间原来生产水平很低，职工们为了赛过他们的对手，认真学习、推广了对方的先进经验，生产大有起色。他们撤装一座炉子已由原来的七、八小时缩短到二、三小时，7月份这个转炉车间的利用系数因此比6月份提高了32.16％，质量也有提高。重庆几个钢铁厂共有六个转炉车间，原来先进的生产水平与一般水平距离很大，如转炉寿命，有些炉子已达到五十炉到七十多炉，而多数炉子还停留在三十炉左右。7月份这几个条件基本相同的车间展开对手竞赛以后，炉子寿命、钢的质量和转炉利用系数都显著改进了。在煤炭系统，原来重庆天府煤矿三井十六采煤小组生产最好。这个小组今年1月份采煤两千多吨，4月份提高到八千多吨，为全市各薄煤层采煤小组树立了榜样。天府煤矿就把它立为“标兵”，全矿六十个采煤小组纷纷推广他们的经验，以它为对象开展竞赛。现在，这个矿已经有四个采煤小组和两个掘进小组达到了“红旗工作面”的水平，八个小组接近“红旗工作面”的水平。全矿采煤水平最低的三十八组，也由原来日产煤六十吨提高到日产煤一百二十吨。
    个人之间的竞赛更是热烈。许多厂矿的职工几乎人人为自己树立了一个对立面，谁都不甘落后，哪里有先进人物、先进经验就风起云涌地去学，去赶。重庆钢铁公司大平炉厂有个进料司机刘映华，创造了安全进料多开关操作经验，以九十五分钟突破了原来一百二十分钟进一炉料的纪录，对缩短冶炼时间起了很大作用。另一个进料司机周君朝和刘映华同时进厂，跟同一个师傅学的技术，生产成绩却相差很远。于是，他就向刘映华提了竞赛条件，以他作为自己学习的榜样，积极研究刘映华进料快的经验，结果既发现了刘映华的优点，又发现了自己操作中的缺点。他就想法努力克服这些缺点，终于赶上了刘映华。刘映华又反回来积极向他学习，改进操作方法，终于创造了进七十七斗料只用八十七分钟的新纪录。后来，周君朝又创造了六十九斗料用七十分钟进完的更高纪录。就这样，两师兄弟，你追我赶，推动了彼此的进步。
    重庆市工业战线上普遍开展赶“标兵”的对手竞赛以后，显著的效果是变少数人、少数单位的高产优质为“大面积”丰产。重庆几个钢铁厂的六个转炉车间，开展对手竞赛后的十天内，钢的质量比竞赛前提高了5.18％，产量稳步上升。重庆建设机床厂在制造转炉设备过程中，原来按厂里现有大型设备核算，差二十多部。工厂领导方面组织全厂四十六部大型设备开展同工种对手竞赛，大力推广先进经验，结果提高生产能力58.53％，弥补了机床的不足。为了加强竞赛的领导，市级领导机关和大部分厂矿都建立或健全了指导竞赛和总结推广先进经验的组织机构，有如打仗一样，订出作战计划，针对生产上的关键问题把一些主要“标兵”的先进经验分别排队，定期推广。为了在8、9月份掀起更大规模的新的生产竞赛高潮，市里还召开了1959年上半年度先进生产者和先进工作者代表会议。
