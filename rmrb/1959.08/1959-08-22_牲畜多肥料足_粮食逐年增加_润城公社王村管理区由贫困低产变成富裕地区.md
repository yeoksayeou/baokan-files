Our Taiyuan dispatch on August 21st: The Wangcun Management Area of Runcheng Commune in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, used to be a low-yielding area with thick rocks, thin soil, and riverside sandy land. In recent years, due to the emphasis on developing livestock, increasing the application of manure, and increasing draught power, grain production has risen sharply: in 1955, grain yield per mu was 330 jin, and in 1958 it rose to 476 jin. This management area has transformed from a most impoverished and low-yielding area into the most prosperous management area in the entire commune.

In 1957, this management area (then an advanced cooperative) was divided into six production teams. During the autumn summary and evaluation of high-yield units, the Fifth Team was rated as the model high-yield team of the entire cooperative. The 248 mu of land in this team averaged 473 jin per mu, 71 jin more than the average yield per mu in the entire cooperative; 107 jin more per mu on average than the Sixth Team, which had the same land and the same farming conditions. Soon after the evaluation ended, the masses discussed one after another, saying: "The Fifth Team and the Sixth Team are on the same mountain slope, why did the Fifth Team increase production?" Some said: "The soil quality and cultivation are the same, why did the Sixth Team harvest less grain?"

What was the reason for the Fifth Team's increased production?栗洪林 (Li Honglin), an old man from the Fourth Team, said: "You only say that the soil quality is the same, but you didn't see if the livestock are as many? The Sixth Team has an average of one livestock per mu, but the Fifth Team has one and a half livestock per mu; more livestock means more fertilizer, of course, you will harvest more grain!" Li Honglin's speech accurately identified the key to the Fifth Team's increased production. Of course, after the number of livestock increased, the draught power also increased. This year, in addition to replacing all the five-inch plows used in 1957 with eight-inch plows, seven new double-share plows and twenty-six deep plows were added. In addition, the entire management area also added fifty-seven large carts this year, changing the transportation of fertilizer and grain from human carrying to cart transportation, basically realizing cart mechanization. These are also factors in increasing production.

According to the masses' demand for large-scale development of livestock, in addition to determining that the Party branch secretary would take the lead and the branch committee members would be responsible for the teams, the Party branch immediately established a livestock professional team. By the end of last year, the number of large livestock had increased to 171, an increase of 82 compared to 1957, nearly doubling; the total number of pigs and sheep had increased to 861 (heads/pieces), an increase of 637 (heads/pieces) compared to 1957, more than two and a half times; coupled with the 1,397 people, calculated according to the 1,612 mu of land in the entire area, the quantity of fertilizer greatly increased and the quality greatly improved. Last year, the grain yield per mu in the entire management area rose to 476 jin, an increase of 74 jin compared to 1957. In particular, the 1,060 mu of replanted wheat averaged 201.3 jin per mu, an increase of 119.2 jin compared to 1957. Right after summarizing the experience in high yields last year, the members actively responded to the Party branch's call and pushed livestock production to a new high tide. According to statistics, the total number of large livestock in the entire management area has now increased to 210, pigs 2,373 (excluding the 138 that have been sold to the state), and sheep 284. In more than half a year, the number of newly developed large livestock, pigs, and sheep is nearly two and a half times the actual number at the end of 1958. There are an average of 1.7 livestock per mu.

Having sufficient high-quality fertilizer not only establishes the production increase plan on a reliable material basis, but also further encourages the production enthusiasm of the vast number of members. At present, in addition to plowing the 1,600 mu of autumn crops three times and topdressing twice (of which 234 mu of cotton has been hoed four times and topdressed three times), striving to exceed production in the autumn, they have also launched a preparation upsurge to ensure increased wheat production next year. Taking fertilizer as an example, the currently prepared base fertilizer for wheat fields totals more than 112,300 dan. Calculated according to sowing 1,100 mu of wheat, each mu has an average of 102 dan. Before the wheat is sown, they are fully confident that they can achieve the plan of applying 150 dan of base fertilizer per mu.

### 牲畜多肥料足　粮食逐年增加  润城公社王村管理区由贫困低产变成富裕地区

    牲畜多肥料足　粮食逐年增加
    润城公社王村管理区由贫困低产变成富裕地区
    本报太原21日电　山西阳城县润城公社王村管理区，原是个石厚土薄、沿河沙滩的低产区。几年来，由于重视了发展牲畜，增施畜肥和役力增加，粮食产量直线上升：1955年粮食亩产三百三十斤，1958年上升为四百七十六斤。这个管理区已经由一个最贫苦的低产区，变成了全公社最富裕的一个管理区。
    1957年，这个管理区（当时是高级社）共分为六个生产小队。秋季总结评比丰产单位时，第五小队便被评为全社的模范丰产队。这个小队的二百四十八亩土地，平均亩产四百七十三斤，比全社平均亩产量多七十一斤；比同样土地、同样耕作条件的第六小队，每亩平均多产一百零七斤。评比结束不久，群众纷纷议论说：“五队六队一架山，为啥五队增了产？”有的说：“土质耕作都一样，六队为啥少打粮？”
    五队的增产原因在哪里呢？第四小队栗洪林老汉说：“你们光说土质一样，就没看看牲畜是不是一样多？第六队一亩地平均有一个牲口，可人家五队一亩地就有一个半牲口；牲口多肥料多，当然就得多打粮！”栗洪林老汉的发言，一针见血地把五队的增产关键找出来了。当然，牲畜多了以后，也增加了畜力，今年除了把1957年使用的五寸犁全部改为八寸犁外，还新增加七部双铧犁，二十六部深翻犁。另外，全管理区今年还新添了五十七辆大车，运肥、送粮都变人挑为车运，基本实现了车子化。这些也都是增产的因素。
    根据群众大量发展牲畜的要求，党支部除确定书记挂帅，支委分队包干以外，还马上建立了一支畜牧专业队。到去年年底大牲畜已发展到一百七十一头，比1957年增加了八十二头，将近翻了一番；猪羊共发展到八百六十一头（只），比1957年增加了六百三十七头（只），翻了两番半还多；再加上一千三百九十七口人，按全区一千六百一十二亩土地计算，肥料的数量大大增加，质量大大提高。去年全管理区的粮食亩产量，上升到了四百七十六斤，比1957年增产七十四斤。特别是一千零六十亩回茬小麦，平均亩产到二百零一斤三两，比1957年增产了一百一十九斤二两。就在去年总结丰产经验以后，社员们积极响应了党支部号召，把畜牧业生产推向了一个更新的高潮。据统计，现在全管理区大牲口已发展到二百一十头，猪二千三百七十三头（不包括已出卖给国家的一百三十八头），羊二百八十四只。半年多来，大牲口、猪、羊新发展数，比1958年底实有数将近翻了两番。平均每亩地有一点七个牲畜。
    有了足够的优质肥料，不仅使增产计划建立在可靠的物质基础上，也进一步鼓舞了广大社员的生产劲头。目前，他们除把一千六百亩大秋作物普锄过三遍，追肥两次（其中二百三十四亩棉花已锄四追三），力争秋季超产外，还掀起一个为保证明年小麦增产的准备高潮。就拿肥料来说，现在已准备好的麦田底肥，共有十一万二千三百多担，按播种一千一百亩小麦计算，每亩已平均有一百零二担，到小麦下种以前，满有把握可以实现亩施底肥一百五十担的计划。
