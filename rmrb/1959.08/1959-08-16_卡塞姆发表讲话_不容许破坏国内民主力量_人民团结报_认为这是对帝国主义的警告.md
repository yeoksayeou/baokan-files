Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 14th: Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem, in a speech at the graduation ceremony of the Reserve Officers Academy on the 13th, said that he would "not forgive and not allow actions that undermine domestic democratic forces."

Kassem said, "We will destroy imperialism and completely eliminate feudalism and reactionaries." He said, "We must save the motherland and free it from imperialism and those who follow the old path of imperialism."

The Prime Minister said he "supports every word and every character said by the president of the Special Military Court." The Prosecutor General of the Iraqi Special Supreme Military Tribunal, Amin, telegraphed Kassem, saying that Kassem's speech had silenced the evil people, "who slander the People's Court and focus their firepower on the Prosecutor's Committee."

Today's "People's Unity" newspaper believes that Kassem's speech is a warning to imperialism and reactionaries, and reaffirms the need to encourage democratic forces.

    卡塞姆发表讲话
    不容许破坏国内民主力量
    “人民团结报”认为这是对帝国主义的警告
    新华社巴格达14日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆13日在后备军官学院毕业典礼上讲话时说，他将“不原谅和不容许破坏国内民主力量的行动”。
    卡塞姆说，“我们将摧毁帝国主义，完全消灭封建主义和反动派”。他说，“要拯救祖国，使它摆脱帝国主义和走帝国主义老路的人”。
    总理说，他“支持特别军事法庭庭长所说的每一句话和每一个字”。伊拉克特别最高军事法庭检察长阿明打电报给卡塞姆说，卡塞姆的演说已经使得邪恶的人闭上嘴巴，“这些人诽谤人民法庭，而且把他们的火力集中对着检察委员会。”
    今天的“人民团结报”认为，卡塞姆的讲话是对帝国主义和反动派的警告，并且重新肯定要鼓励民主力量。
