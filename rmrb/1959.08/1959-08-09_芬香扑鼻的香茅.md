Tropical Specialty

　　The appearance of lemongrass is similar to the wild cogon grass in southern China. The difference is that when you rub the lemongrass leaves with your hands, you will smell a strong fragrance. People cut these lemongrass leaves, and after distillation, they are made into valuable lemongrass oil. This lemongrass oil can be used to manufacture perfumes, essential oils, scented soaps, face powder, and other cosmetics. In addition, the distilled leaves can also be used for papermaking.

　　Lemongrass is native to tropical areas such as Indonesia. In 1935, overseas Chinese introduced it to Hainan Island from Java. Since then, the hardworking people of Hainan Island have been cultivating it diligently, but it did not develop on a large scale before liberation. After liberation, especially after agricultural cooperativization, people began to cultivate lemongrass on a large scale by reclaiming wasteland, and lemongrass grew throughout the island. At present, the total area of lemongrass cultivation on the island has reached more than 100,000 mu. The lemongrass oil produced every year can not only meet domestic needs, but also be exported in large quantities. (Attached picture)

    芬香扑鼻的香茅
    香茅的外形，和我国南方野生的茅草相似，不同的是，当你用手揉一揉香茅叶片的时候，就会闻到一股浓郁的香味。人们割下这些香茅叶片，经过蒸馏后，就制成价值很高的香茅油。这种香茅油，可以用来制造香水、香精、香皂、香粉等化妆品。另外，蒸馏后的叶片，还可用来造纸。
    香茅原产于印度尼西亚等热带地方，1935年由华侨从爪哇传入海南岛。此后，勤劳的海南岛人民就一直苦心栽培它，但解放前没有得到大量发展。解放后，特别是农业合作化以后，人们才大量地开垦荒地种植香茅，使香茅生长遍及全岛。目前，全岛香茅种植面积已达十多万亩。每年出产的香茅油，不仅可以满足国内的需要，还能大量出口。（附图片）
