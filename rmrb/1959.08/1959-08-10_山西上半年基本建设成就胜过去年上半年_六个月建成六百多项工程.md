According to the Shanxi Daily, Shanxi Province achieved great success on the basic construction front in the first half of the year, with the cumulative amount of basic construction investment completed being 9% higher than in the same period last year. The basic construction of industrial sectors such as coal, metallurgy, and machinery all completed more than 40% of the annual investment plan, basically ensuring the progress of national key industrial construction. In the first half of the year, a total of 607 construction projects were completed in the province, with a completed construction area of 310,000 square meters, adding 210,000 tons of iron smelting capacity, 40,000 tons of coke oven capacity, 290,000 tons of coal mining capacity, 5,880 kilowatts of power generation capacity, 33,000 spindles, 422 looms, 24.58 kilometers of railways, and 218 kilometers of highways for the whole year. This has laid a good foundation for the comprehensive completion of the 1959 production tasks.

Shanxi Province's achievements in basic construction in the first half of the year were obtained by breaking through the "material and transportation" bottlenecks. In light of the large basic construction tasks this year and the shortage of materials and transportation capacity, various regions compressed a number of construction projects that did not meet the conditions in the second quarter, concentrating materials, transportation, and construction forces to accelerate the project progress of key construction projects and construction projects that met the conditions. In order to solve the contradiction between material supply time and project progress, the Shanxi Provincial Electric Power Department established a material supply management organization and adopted a series of measures such as internal adjustment, external cooperation, and urging delivery, which basically guaranteed the material supply for key projects. Many units vigorously carried out communist cooperation. 70% of the 510,000 ton-kilometers of transportation tasks in basic construction in the province in the first half of the year were completed through cooperation with other units.

This spring, the basic construction department of Shanxi Province conducted a province-wide inspection of project quality. After the inspection, various construction enterprises established and restored quality supervision and inspection organizations one after another, strengthened quality supervision and inspection work, and generally rectified and revised various rules and regulations to ensure project quality. These measures ensure the project quality of basic construction. Taking the Construction Department system as an example, the quality accidents of the construction and installation units under the department in the first half of this year decreased by 42% compared with the same period last year, and the quality of 95% of the projects that have been completed reached excellent.

In the first half of the year, construction and installation enterprises throughout the province universally carried out socialist red flag emulation campaigns centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, and set off a wave of learning from and catching up with pace-setters. According to statistics from ten construction enterprises including the Shanxi Provincial Construction Department, more than 160 collective pace-setters such as work areas, work teams, and groups, and more than 130 individual pace-setters were established by the end of May. The employees of the eleven enterprises under the department put forward more than 9,000 rationalization proposals in April, and more than 2,000 of them have been realized by the beginning of June, creating a value of 370,000 yuan, which has effectively solved the key problems in construction and accelerated the progress of the project.

    山西上半年基本建设成就胜过去年上半年
    六个月建成六百多项工程
    据山西日报消息　山西省上半年在基本建设战线上取得了巨大成绩，累计完成的基本建设投资额比去年同期高9％。煤炭、冶金、机械等工业部门的基本建设，都完成了全年投资计划40％以上，基本上保证了国家重点工业的建设进度。上半年全省竣工的建设项目共六百零七个，竣工的建筑面积达三十一万平方米，为全年新增加炼铁能力二十一万吨、炼焦能力四万吨、采煤能力二十九万吨、发电容量五千八百八十瓩、纱锭三万三千锭、布机四百二十二台、铁路二十四点五八公里、公路二百一十八公里。这就为全面完成1959年生产任务打下了良好基础。
    山西省上半年基本建设方面的这些成绩是在大破“材料、运输”关的情况下取得的。根据今年基本建设任务大、材料和运输力不足的情况，各地区在二季度都压缩了一批条件不具备的建设项目，集中材料、运输、施工力量，加快了重点建设项目和条件具备的建设项目的工程进度。山西省电力厅为了解决材料供应时间和工程进度的矛盾，成立了材料供应专管机构，采取了内部调剂、对外协作、坐催交货等一系列办法，基本上保证了重点工程的材料供应。不少单位大搞共产主义协作。全省上半年基本建设方面的五十一万吨公里运输任务，70％是靠和外单位协作完成的。
    今年春季，山西省基本建设部门进行了一次全省性的工程质量大检查。经过检查，各建筑企业先后建立和恢复了质量监督检查机构，加强了质量监督检查工作，普遍整顿和修订了各种保证工程质量的规章制度。这些措施保证了基本建设的工程质量。以建设厅系统为例，该厅所属的建筑安装单位今年上半年发生的质量事故比去年同期减少了42％，已交工的工程95％质量达到优良。
    上半年全省建筑安装企业普遍开展了以技术革新和技术革命为中心的社会主义红旗竞赛运动，掀起了学标兵、赶标兵的热潮。据山西省建设厅等十个建筑企业5月底统计，共树立了工区、工队、小组等集体标兵一百六十多个、个人标兵一百三十多个。该厅所属十一个企业的职工在4月份提出合理化建议九千多件，截至6月初已实现了二千余件，创造价值达三十七万元，有力地解决了施工中的关键问题，加快了工程进度。
