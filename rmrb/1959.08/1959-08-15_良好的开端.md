At the national academic symposium on traditional Chinese medicine meridians and acupuncture, convened by the Ministry of Health, representatives of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine gathered together. They presented and discussed a large number of academic papers, collectively demonstrating the significant achievements made in the previous period in conducting TCM academic research using modern scientific methods. This marks a good beginning for sorting out and studying the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and for extensive exchange of experience between TCM and Western medicine.

Carrying out TCM academic research is an important part of implementing the Party's TCM policy and is also a necessary path for promoting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and developing China's new medicine. As more and more Western doctors study TCM and TCM and Western medicine discover more and more treasures of TCM in cooperative clinical practice, a large amount of data is provided for carrying out academic research. If we use modern scientific methods to conduct careful observations on the efficacy of many TCM treatments, and carry out chemical analysis and research on drugs, mechanisms, and repeated clinical practice and research, it will be very beneficial to enrich the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, promote its application, and promote the progress of the entire TCM work. Therefore, for academic research, close cooperation between TCM and Western medicine is needed to continue efforts, muster full energy, and strive for greater achievements.

　　良好的开端
    在中央卫生部召开的全国中医经络、针灸学术座谈会上，中西医代表聚首一堂，宣读并讨论了大量学术论文，集中地表现出前一时期各地在运用现代科学方法，开展中医学术研究方面所获得的显著成就。这是整理研究祖国医学遗产、中西医广泛交流经验的良好开端。
    开展中医学术研究工作，是贯彻党的中医政策的重要一环，也是发扬祖国医学遗产、发展中国新医学的必经之路。随着广大西医学习中医、中西医在合作临床中发掘中医的珍宝越来越多，就为开展学术研究工作提供了大量资料。如果对中医治疗的许多病例的疗效，运用现代科学方法，进行细致的观察，并对药物加以化验和研究，机制，经过反复临床实践和研究，对丰富祖国医学宝库，以及推广应用，促进整个中医工作前进，都很有益。因此，对于学术研究工作，需要中西医密切合作，再接再厉，鼓足干劲，争取获得更大的成就。
