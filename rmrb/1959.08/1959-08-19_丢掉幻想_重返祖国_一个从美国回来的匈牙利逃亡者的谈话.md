Editor's Note: The "Soviet Russia" newspaper published on August 9th a conversation with Pál Pongor, a tailor and refugee from the "October Events" in Hungary who returned from the United States. Based on his personal experience, he exposed the deception and persecution of Hungarian refugees by American human traffickers, as well as the true situation of the so-called "American way of life." The following is an abstract of this conversation:

　　In that chaotic autumn of 1956, my wife and I argued quite fiercely. It happened to coincide with the outbreak of the well-known "Hungarian Incident." At that time, many people left their homeland. Some were frightened by what was happening around them; some engaged in ugly deeds; some took advantage of the freedom to enter and leave the country to seek "happiness."

　　I didn't decide to leave my country all at once. Once I had already arrived at the train station, stood there and thought about it, and went home again. However, my wife and I had another serious argument, and it reached a point of no reconciliation. I took my packed suitcase and went to the station with my two sons from my previous marriage. The elder son, Pál, was fourteen years old, and the younger son, Laci, was twelve. They greeted the impending and uncertain journey with childlike interest.

　　I am not prepared to talk about how we arrived at the "Austrian Refugee Camp." There were about one or two dozen recruiters there. What surprised me a bit was that I was the first to receive a notice to go to the United States.

　　After living in that country across the ocean for four months, I had already made up my mind to return to my country. Unfortunately, various reasons hindered me. They quickly arranged a job for me. On January 4, 1957, I was already working in a clothing factory in a clothing store in a small town called Grand Rapids in Michigan. I worked forty hours a week, and my salary (after taxes) was initially fifty-five dollars, and near the end of my work there it was fifty-nine dollars.

　　At the beginning, I was very happy with a deceptive suggestion made by our guardian, which was: to buy a detached house by installments. The monthly payment was one hundred dollars. I knew this would be difficult, but I thought, anyway, in a few years the house would be my property! The monthly food expenses for the three of us were ninety-five to one hundred dollars. Monthly gas and electricity bills were about twenty-five dollars.

　　Of course, this was very expensive. When I received a salary of five thousand forints (Hungarian currency) in Budapest, I lived in a very beautiful house and only paid a rent of one hundred and sixteen forints, and the water and electricity bills were about fifty forints. In other words, in Budapest, the rent only accounted for a little more than 2% of my salary, but in the United States, the rent and utilities accounted for more than half of my salary!

　　When I suddenly learned that the guardian and the agent who sold the house in installments had deceived me, I couldn't help but feel discouraged. It turned out that only forty-five dollars of the one hundred dollars I paid each month was for the house, and the remaining fifty-five dollars was interest on the installments. It was as if I borrowed money from the landlord and paid him interest. Moreover, my money could never be returned. As long as I could not pay the rent on time for some reason, then all the money I had paid in the past would be completely gone.

　　The propaganda machine across the ocean vigorously trumpets human rights, and that the "American way of life" is the ideal way of life for all times and all peoples, as if there is no and cannot be a better way of life on earth. However, now I know how much this statement is actually worth.

　　There were some Americans who worked with me in the same factory and the same workshop. I didn't even know how much money they earned. In terms of skill, they were no different from me. I thought their wages were the same as mine. Once on a weekend, one of them tore up a receipt with his salary amount written on it. There was no one in the workshop at the time, and I picked up the pieces, pieced them together, and realized that his weekly salary was not fifty-five dollars, but more than one hundred dollars.

　　All the recruiters who visited the "refugee camps" in Austria, the gentlemen, newspapers, radio stations, and priests, all unanimously asserted that Western countries, especially the United States, were making every effort to help the "poor Hungarians." In fact, hidden behind the feigned tears of these "philanthropists" were the opportunities to make a good deal and the intention to make money at all costs.

　　Later, I thoroughly understood this point. I was told that an official even boasted that American businessmen made a profit in the "Hungarian refugee trade." According to him, this profit amounted to thirty million dollars.

　　Of course, I once tried to raise the issue of increasing my salary, on the grounds that I had two children and I was a very good expert. However, from the tone of their reply and the mocking look in their eyes, I understood that there was no hope. I personally learned from American newspapers that at the beginning of 1958, there were already eight million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the United States. In the United States, I felt that there was an army of unemployed people eager to find any job standing behind me. I did not doubt that there were also tailors among them.

　　My monthly budget was like this: work for fourteen days to pay the rent, and work for another week to cover transportation and utility expenses. In addition, I had to take some money from my income to give to the church. I also had to support two children! You know, children have to pay tuition to go to school, and my children and I have to wear clothes.

　　What if one of the children gets sick? If I got sick myself, it would be even worse! We had no savings. Every American knows that if you don't have enough money in the bank to support your whole family for a few months, you don't have the right to get sick.

　　From April 1957, I began to work on the issue of returning to my country. However, they began to obstruct my return to the country in every possible way. When I kept raising the issue of returning to the country, they even resorted to threatening me.

　　In Grand Rapids, I did not wait for any help, so I packed my things, abandoned "my own" house, and returned to my country. I finally returned to my own country.

　　Now, I have returned home, and my whole family is reunited. I have already started working. I know that here, in the People's Republic of Hungary, no one will say such heartless words to me and other hundreds of thousands of workers: here is your account, don't come to work tomorrow. I know that if I get sick, the country will take care of me, and the money I have saved through work will be completely preserved.

　　I am now completely convinced that the reports in the Hungarian newspapers about the life in capitalist countries are not only true, but the actual situation is even worse than what we see in our newspapers. Among those Hungarians whom I have met who are living in the United States, including those whom I have met in the immigration office, they are convinced that most of the people have tasted the "flavor" of American life, and are determined to return home.

### 丢掉幻想　重返祖国——一个从美国回来的匈牙利逃亡者的谈话

　　丢掉幻想　重返祖国
　　——一个从美国回来的匈牙利逃亡者的谈话
    编者按　8月9日“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上刊登了从美国回来的匈牙利“十月事件”时期的逃亡者、裁缝帕尔·朋高尔的一篇谈话。他以亲身的经历揭露了美国人口贩子们对匈牙利逃亡者的欺骗和迫害，以及所谓“美国生活方式”的真实情况。下面就是这篇谈话的摘要：
    在那混乱的1956年的秋天，我和我的妻子争吵得相当厉害。当时正赶上爆发了那个众所周知的“匈牙利事件”。那时有不少人离开了祖国。有的人被周围发生的事情吓破了胆；有的人干上了丑恶的勾当；有的人利用自由出入国境的机会去寻找“幸福”。
    我不是一下子就打定主意离开祖国的。有一次我已经到了火车站，站在那里想了一下，又回家去了。但是，我和我的妻子又发生了一次严重的争吵，而且闹到不能和解的地步。我就拿上已包装好的手提包，带着前妻留下的两个儿子到车站去了。大儿子帕尔十四岁，小儿子拉齐十二岁。他们怀着童稚的兴趣迎接了即将开始的行踪不定的旅行。
    我们怎样到达“奥地利难民营”的情况，我不准备谈了。那里有一、二十个招工的。使我有点吃惊的是，我是最先接到去美国的通知的。
    在大洋彼岸的国家里生活四个月之后，我就已经下定决心要返回祖国了。遗憾的是有各种各样的原因阻碍着我。他们很快就给我安排了工作。1957年1月4日，我就已经在密执安州的一个叫做格兰德·莱比兹的小城镇上一家服装商店的服装厂里工作。我每周工作四十小时，我的工资（扣除税钱）起初是五十五美元，到我的工作快结束的时候是五十九美元。
    一开头，我们的监护人提出的一个骗人的建议使我很高兴，那就是：可以用分期付款办法购买一所独门独户的小房子。每个月要交一百美元的房价。我知道这是有困难的，但是我又一想，反正再过几年房子就算是我的财产了！我们三口人每月的伙食费用需要九十五至一百美元。每月的煤气和水电费大约需要二十五美元。
    当然，这是很贵的。在布达佩斯我拿到五千福林（匈币）的工资的时候，我住的一幢很漂亮的房子只花一百一十六福林的房租，而水电费大约五十福林。换句话说，在布达佩斯房租只占我的工资的2％多一点，但是在美国的房租水电却占去我的工资的一半还多！
    当我突然了解到监护人和分期出卖房屋的代理人欺骗了我的时候，我不禁心灰意冷。原来我每月交的一百美元房价中，只有四十五元是房钱，剩下的五十五元是分期付款的利息。也就等于是我借了房主的钱，付给他利息。而且，我的钱是再也退不回来了。只要我因为某种原因不能按期交房钱，那末过去已经交的钱也就全部完蛋了。
    大洋彼岸的宣传机器大肆吹嘘人权，以及“美国生活方式”对于一切时代、一切民族都是理想的生活方式，仿佛地球上没有也不可能有比它更好的生活方式了。但是，现在我知道这种说法实际上值几个钱。
    同厂、同车间和我一起工作的有一些美国人。我甚至不知道他们赚多少钱。按熟练程度说，他们和我没有什么区别。我以为他们的工资和我是一样的。有一次周末他们之中有一个人撕了一张记着他的工资钱数的一个单据。当时车间里没有人，我拾起了碎片，拼凑起来一看，才知道他每周的工资不是五十五美元，而是一百多美元。
    在奥地利所有的招工的、访问过“难民营”的大人先生们、报刊、电台和神甫，都异口同声地断言说西方国家，首先是美国尽一切努力来帮助“可怜的匈牙利人”。其实呢，隐藏在这些“慈善家”的假惺惺的眼泪背后的，却是不放过一切好生意的机会和极力赚钱的打算。
    后来，我彻底弄清了这一点。人们告诉我说，一个官方人士甚至吹嘘美国商人在“匈牙利难民的交易”中赚的利润。照他说来，这笔利润达三千万美元。
    我当然曾经企图提出增加工资的问题，理由是我有两个孩子，我是一个很好的专家。但是，从他们答复的口气和奚落的眼神来看，我明白是没有希望的。我亲自从美国报纸上知道，当时在1958年初美国的失业和半失业者已经有八百万人。在美国我感到有一支渴望找到任何工作的失业大军站在我的背后。我并不怀疑，他们当中也有裁缝工人。
    我的每月预算是这样的：作十四天工作，以便付房租，再作一个星期的工作以便应付交通费和水电费的开支。此外，我还得从自己的收入中拿出些钱来交给教堂。我还得养活两个孩子！要知道，孩子上学还要交学费，我和孩子们还要穿衣服。
    如果有一个孩子生了病，怎么办呢？要是我自己生了病那就会更惨！我们又没有积蓄。每一个美国人都知道，要是你在银行没有存上足够你全家人生活几个月的钱，你就没有权利生病。
    从1957年4月起，我就开始为重返祖国问题而奔走。但是，他们开始百般地阻挠我回国。当我一直提出要回国的问题的时候，他们竟不惜恐吓我。
    在布兰德·莱比兹我没有等到任何的帮助，就收拾东西，丢下了“自己的”房子，回国了。我终于回到了自己的国家。
    现在，我重返家园了，我们全家又团聚了。我已经开始工作了。我知道，在这里，在匈牙利人民共和国，谁也不会对我和其他成千上万的劳动者说出这样没心肝的话：给你算帐，你明天不要上班了。我知道，如果我生了病，国家会关心我，我靠劳动积蓄的钱也会完整地保存下来。
    我现在完全确信，匈牙利报刊对于资本主义国家生活的报道，不仅是真实的，而且实际情况比从我们报纸报道中看到的还要糟。在我会见过的那些流落在美国的匈牙利人当中，包括那些在移民局里见过的人，都坚信大多数的人已经尝到了美国生活的“滋味”，而一心要重返家园。（附图片）
