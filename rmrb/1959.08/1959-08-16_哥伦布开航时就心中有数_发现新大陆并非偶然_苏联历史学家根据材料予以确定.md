	Columbus Knew What He Was Doing When He Set Sail
	The Discovery of the New World Was Not Accidental
	Soviet Historians Confirm Based on Materials

	Up until now, general history and geography books have considered Columbus's discovery of America to be accidental, without prior estimation. However, the Soviet magazine "Science and Life" recently published an interesting report that refutes this claim. It uses solid materials to prove that Columbus had already obtained information about America before setting sail. From the beginning, he intended to sail towards the New World, not to Asia as commonly believed.

	The report states that after meticulously studying the original Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian archives, as well as other valuable versions of materials, Ch. K. Tsereteli, Associate Professor of History and Candidate of Historical Sciences at the Kazakh Abai Pedagogical Institute, determined that Columbus possessed precise materials about certain regions of the New World before discovering it. He also knew the shortest route to this New World. The explorer even carried a map of the Antilles with him on the voyage. Columbus's diary, his son's notes, and the notes of participants in the first voyage all prove that Columbus had no intention of sailing to Asia as commonly said, and that his voyage was directed towards the New World.

	The report says that, interestingly, Columbus's actions were entirely based on materials from some Portuguese navigators. These people had been to the Antilles but kept the information they obtained a secret.

	Tsereteli discovered an extremely valuable letter from Columbus's son in the archival materials, which talked about a secret instruction from his father. Before setting sail, Columbus had issued a copy of this instruction to all ship captains, ordering them to open it only when the ships lost contact with each other due to storms. This instruction stated that the ships should sail at maximum speed, day and night, for seven hundred leagues (a Spanish length unit roughly equal to 4,700 kilometers). After that, they should only sail during the day. Columbus's son correctly pointed out that his father would not have given such an instruction unless he knew exactly where the land was. The instruction also correctly pointed out that the distance from the Canary Islands (from where Columbus's fleet departed in 1422) to the Antilles was about seven hundred and fifty leagues. The memoirs of one of the participants in that voyage, Vallejo, also confirmed this instruction. It said that the entire fleet followed this instruction throughout the voyage until the discovery of the New World.

### 哥伦布开航时就心中有数  发现新大陆并非偶然  苏联历史学家根据材料予以确定

    哥伦布开航时就心中有数
    发现新大陆并非偶然
    苏联历史学家根据材料予以确定
    到现在为止，一般的历史和地理书籍，都认为哥伦布是偶然发现美洲的，事先并没有估计到。但是，苏联杂志“科学与生活”不久前发表了一篇有趣的报道，却否定了这个说法。它用确凿的材料证明，哥伦布在出发航行以前，早已获得了有关美洲的资料。一开始就是要航向新大陆，并非像一般说的，是原想航行到亚洲。
    这篇报道说，苏联哈萨克阿巴依师范学院副教授、历史学副博士楚凯尔尼克经过周密地研究了西班牙、葡萄牙和意大利的档案原本和其他一些珍贵的版本材料后，确定哥伦布在发现新大陆以前，就拥有关于新大陆某些地区的精确材料。他也知道到达这个新世界的最短的航程。这位旅行家在航行中甚至还带了安的列斯群岛的地图。哥伦布的日记、他儿子的笔记和第一次航行的参加者的笔记都证明，哥伦布完全没有像一般所说的准备航行到亚洲，他的航程正是对着新大陆的。
    这篇报道说，有趣的是，哥伦布的行动完全都是根据一些葡萄牙的航海家的材料进行的。这些人曾经到过安的列斯群岛，但是他们把获得的材料保守秘密。
    楚凯尔尼克在档案材料中发现了哥伦布儿子的一封极其宝贵的书信，信中谈到了他父亲的一个秘密指示。哥伦布在起程航行前，曾把这份指示的副本发给所有轮船的船长，并且命令他们只能在轮船由于暴风雨而相互失去联系时才能开启指示。这个指示说，轮船应当不分昼夜以最高速度航行七百里格（西班牙长度名约等于四千七百公里）的路程。此后，便只能在白天航行。哥伦布的儿子正确地指出，他父亲要作出这样的指示，就非精确地知道陆地的所在处不可。指示还正确地指出了从加那利群岛（哥伦布的船队1422年离开那里）到安的列斯群岛的距离约为七百五十里格。在参加那次航行的人员之一瓦利埃荷的回忆录也证实了这个指示。它说，整个船队在航行期间，直到发现新大陆为止，都是根据这个指示行动的。
