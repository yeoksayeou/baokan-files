Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 21st: As of August 15th, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, rich in forest resources, had overfulfilled its annual timber logging task by 10,830 cubic meters, with 41.93% of the timber already transported to various locations.

Since the beginning of spring, Party committees at all levels in Guangxi have sent cadres deep into logging sites to strengthen leadership. Forestry workers have also launched a competition movement, comparing logging specifications and quality, saving labor, speeding up afforestation, and exceeding production targets. Various logging sites have also added power saws and curved handle saws equipped with internal combustion engines, significantly increasing timber production. Workers have also opened 115 kilometers of timber transport roads in the forest areas, built 582 small river dams, five river interception facilities, and more than 80 kilometers of forest roads, greatly improving timber transport efficiency.

Currently, following the timber logging upsurge, a high tide of timber rush is emerging in various forest areas. The labor force for rushing timber has rapidly increased from 40,000 to over 70,000. Workers are full of energy, striving to complete the annual timber transport task ahead of schedule before the river water recedes in August and September.

Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, August 21st: Workers in the Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range forest area have launched a high tide of timber transportation, with timber shipment volume increasing steadily recently. In the first half of August, the forest area transported over 180,000 cubic meters of pit props, sleepers, and various logs, strongly supporting the production of key coal mines and railway, flood control, and other engineering construction projects.

The Greater Khingan Range increased production of a large amount of timber in the first half of the year, but a considerable portion was not transported out in time. In order to rush the timber out, the Greater Khingan Range Forestry Administration held two meetings in early and mid-July to arrange the rush transport work. The Hulunbuir League Committee of the Communist Party of China also convened a rush transport coordination meeting of forestry, railway, and other relevant departments, deciding to transport all the timber not transported out in the first half of the year during the third quarter. To this end, under the leadership of the League Party Committee, forest workers launched a blitz of rush transport with full loads and exceeding axle loads, moving quickly, loading and unloading quickly, and adopting various methods to increase loading capacity and loading efficiency, and accelerate vehicle turnover. To increase the loading volume, workers processed logs into boards and squares before loading. In this way, timber that originally required three trucks to transport was loaded with only two trucks. In early August, the average load per truck reached 40.5 cubic meters, exceeding the previous load by more than 15%, saving 270 railcars. In order to achieve "rather let people wait for the car than let the car wait for people," loading workers from the Genhe and Ganhe Forestry Bureaus set up tents and lived on the loading yards so as not to delay loading at night. They also often rushed to load in the rain. One day, led by the Party Secretary, workers from the Genhe Bureau rushed to load 19 trucks of timber in the rain.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 21st: The broad masses of workers in various forest areas of Gansu Province are actively increasing timber production to support construction projects in the province and other regions. As of August 15th, the province had logged more than 276,910 cubic meters of timber, completing 98.9% of the annual production plan. More than 59,100 cubic meters of timber had been transported out, completing 49.33% of this year's transport plan, an increase of more than six times compared with the same period last year.

In order to accelerate the logging and transportation of timber, the workers in the forest areas have brought into play their soaring enthusiasm. The workers fighting in the Dayugou Forest Farm in the Taohe Forest Area studied diligently and improved their logging techniques, increasing the timber logged by each person per day from one cubic meter to five cubic meters, reaching a maximum of 6.5 cubic meters. By the end of July, the Taohe Forestry Bureau had overfulfilled this year's logging task by 8%. Workers in the Taohe and Bailongjiang Forest Areas also tried every possible means to improve the efficiency of timber transport and strive to transport more timber. In more than a month from June to early July, workers from the Taohe Forestry Bureau transported more than 28,000 cubic meters of timber, timely supplying the needs of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station, the Taohe Project, and the key industrial projects in Lanzhou.

Currently, it is the season of high water in the Bailongjiang and Taohe Rivers, and it is also the time when the most timber is transported each year. The relevant departments of Gansu Province have issued an urgent directive to all forest areas in the province, calling on all forestry workers to seize the favorable opportunity of August and September to work hard and overfulfill this year's timber transport plan.

    广西完成全年木材采伐任务
    内蒙古等地林区掀起抢运木材高潮
    新华社南宁21日电　到8月15日止，森林资源丰富的广西僮族自治区，已超额一万零八百三十立方米提前完成今年木材采伐任务，其中41.93％的木材已运往各地。
    入春以来，广西各级党委便层层派出干部，深入伐木场加强领导。林业职工们也开展了比采伐规格质量、比节省劳力、比造林快、比超产的竞赛运动。各个伐木场也都新增加了装有内燃设备的油锯、弯把锯等，增产了不少木材。职工们还在林区新开辟了一百一十五公里运材道，修了五百八十二座小河闸坝，以及五座拦河设施和八十多公里的林区公路等，大大提高木材运输效能。
    目前，各林区继木材采伐高潮之后，又掀起一个抢运木材的高潮。全区抢运木材的劳动力，迅速由四万人增至七万多人，职工们干劲十足，力争在8、9月份河水退落之前，提前完成全年的运材任务。
    新华社牙克石21日电　内蒙古大兴安岭林区职工掀起了调运木材高潮，最近木材运出量节节上升。8月上半月，林区共调运出坑木、枕木及各种原木十八万多立方米，有力地支援了重点煤矿的生产和铁路、防汛等工程建设。
    大兴安岭上半年增产大批木材，但有相当一部分未及时运出。为了把木材抢运出去，大兴安岭林业管理局在7月上、中旬曾召开两次会议布置抢运工作。中共呼伦贝尔盟委员会还召开了林业和铁路等有关部门的抢运协作会议，决定在第三季度内，把上半年未运出的木材全部抢运出去。为此，林区职工在盟党委领导下展开了满载超轴、多拉快跑、快装快卸的突击抢运活动，采取各种办法提高装车量和装车效率，加快车辆的周转。职工们为提高装载量，把原木加工成板方材以后再装车。这样，原来需要三车装运的木材只用两车就装走了。8月上旬平均每车装载木材达四十点五立方米，超过以前装载量15％以上，节省车皮二百七十个。为了作到“宁叫人等车，不叫车等人”，根河和甘河等林业局的装车工人还搭起帐篷住在装车场上，以便夜间不误装车。他们还常常冒雨抢装，根河局职工有一天在党委书记带领下，冒雨抢装了十九车木材。
    新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省各林区广大职工积极增产木材，支援本省和其他地区建设工程。到8月15日止，全省已采伐木材二十七万六千九百一十多立方米，完成了全年生产计划的98.9％。已运出木材五万九千一百多立方米，完成今年放运计划的49.33％，比去年同期增长了六倍多。
    为了加速木材的采伐和运输，林区工人们发挥了冲天干劲。战斗在洮河林区大峪沟林场的工人们，勤学苦钻，提高采伐技术，使每人每日采伐的木材由一立方米增加到五立方米，最高时达到六点五立方米。到7月底，洮河林业局已超额8％完成今年的采伐任务。洮河林区和白龙江林区的职工，还千方百计地提高木材放运效率，争取运出更多的木材。洮河林业局的职工，在6月至7月上旬一个多月内，就运出了二万八千多立方米的木材，及时供应了刘家峡水电站、洮河工程和兰州工业重点工程的需要。
    目前，正是白龙江和洮河水多季节，也是历年放运木材最多的时候。甘肃省有关部门已向全省各林区发出紧急指示，号召全体林业职工抓紧8月、9月的有利时机，大干一场，超额完成今年的木材放运计划。
