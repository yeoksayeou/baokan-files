Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 16th: Under the slogan of accelerating socialist construction, the Hungarian working people have achieved increasingly remarkable results on the industrial and agricultural production fronts.

    July industrial production reports good news
    According to materials published by the Central Bureau of Statistics, in July this year, electricity production increased by 10% compared with the same period last year, coal increased by 6%, steel increased by 10%, tractors increased by 43%, nitrogen fertilizer increased by 35%, cement increased by 24%, television sets increased by 150%, and leather shoes increased by 12%.
    In July this year, retail trade volume increased by 13% compared with July last year, and residents' cash income increased by 10%.

    Wheat harvest exceeds previous years
    In agriculture, according to the "People's Freedom" newspaper, the wheat harvest of state farms and agricultural production cooperatives this year is better than any previous year. State farms and cooperatives have achieved large-scale high yields, with an average wheat yield of 1,960 kilograms per hold (equivalent to 8.55 mu), and barley reaching more than 2,500 kilograms. In early August, most state farms and cooperatives carried out a second supplementary harvest, so there was very little loss of wheat grains this year. Due to deep plowing, careful cultivation, and the increased use of chemical fertilizers, corn and potatoes are also growing better this year than in previous years.
    Last year, Hungary had an unprecedented grape harvest, and this year the grapes are growing even better than last year. Now, bunches of sparkling grapes are hanging all over the branches, and various places are actively preparing for the grape harvest, increasing more winemaking equipment.

    Soon there will be one pig per person on average
    Materials published by the Ministry of Agriculture show that animal husbandry in Hungary has also developed greatly in the first seven months of this year. According to statistics in July, there are a total of 7.4 million pigs in the country, and soon there will be an average of one pig per resident nationwide.

    Formulating goals for the second half of the year
    Recently, workers and staff in factories and enterprises across the country have generally held production meetings to summarize the experience of the first half of the year and formulate specific goals for the second half of the year. The broad masses of workers have put forward that they will further exert their efforts and push production to a new upsurge. They guarantee to complete or over fulfill the tasks they have proposed to present as gifts to the Party Congress to be held in November this year, and resolutely realize the call put forward by the Party: to make the main indicators of national economic development reach the level stipulated for 1960 in the Three-Year Plan by the end of this year.

    坚决响应党的号召保证年底完成三年计划主要指标
　　匈牙利人民乘胜前进掀起生产新高潮
    新华社布达佩斯16日电　在加速社会主义建设的口号下，匈牙利劳动人民在工农业生产战线上取得了日新月异的成绩。
    七月份工业生产报捷
    据中央统计局公布的材料，今年7月份，电力的生产比去年同时期增加了10％，煤增加了6％，钢增加了10％，拖拉机增加了43％，氮肥增加了35％，水泥增加了24％，电视机增加了150％，皮鞋增加了12％。
    今年7月份零售贸易额比去年7月份增长了13％，居民的现金收入提高了10％。
    麦子收成超过往年
    在农业方面，据“人民自由报”报道，今年国营农场和农业生产合作社的麦子收成比过去任何一年都好，国营农场和合作社获得了大面积丰产，小麦平均产量达到每霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）一千九百六十公斤，大麦达到二千五百多公斤。8月初，大部分国营农场和合作社都进行了第二次补收，所以今年的麦粒遗失很少。由于深耕细作和化学肥料的加多，今年玉蜀黍和马铃薯也比往年长得好。
    去年匈牙利的葡萄空前丰收，而今年葡萄比去年长得更好，现在，累累晶莹的葡萄已挂满了枝架，各地正在积极进行收葡萄的准备工作，增加更多的酿酒设备。平均每人很快就有一口猪
    农业部公布的材料表明，匈牙利今年头七个月内畜牧业也有了很大的发展。根据7月份的统计，全国共有七百四十万口猪，很快就可以达到全国居民每人平均一口猪。
    制定下半年奋斗目标
    最近全国各地工厂企业的职工都普遍举行生产会议，总结了上半年的经验，制定了下半年的具体奋斗目标。广大职工纷纷提出，要进一步发挥干劲，把生产推向新的高潮。他们保证要完成或超额完成他们所提出的向将在今年11月召开的党代表大会献礼的任务，坚决实现党所提出的号召：在今年年底使发展国民经济的主要指标达到三年计划所规定的1960年的水平。（附图片）
