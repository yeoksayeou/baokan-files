    Famous Mountains are Not Necessarily High
    Shí Gōng
    The hot summer has arrived, and many people are taking time off from work to recuperate and escape the heat in famous mountains such as Lushan and Huangshan.
    China has more famous mountains than almost any other country in the world, which is related to the fact that China has many high mountains. However, famous mountains are not necessarily very high. Huangshan, Lushan, Tiantai, and Yandang Mountains are all just over a thousand meters above sea level. Even Mount Tai, where "climbing Mount Tai makes one feel the world is small," is only just over 1,500 meters. Mount Hua is over 2,000 meters high, and Mount Wutai and Mount Emei exceed 3,000 meters, which are considered quite high among famous mountains. However, if these mountains were moved to the Qinghai-Tibet area, they would be just ordinary mountain ridges. But there, only mountaineers can climb them, and even if they do, they cannot stay for long due to the thin air and cold climate, so they cannot become resorts for sightseeing and recuperation.
    As the saying goes, "People don't notice a continuous forest, but a single tree stands out." Most famous mountains appear in areas with lower altitudes, probably for this reason. Although the mountains themselves are not very high, they still appear prominent compared to the surrounding plains.
    Why do strange peaks rise abruptly from the plains?
    If you observe carefully, you will find that the rocks that make up famous mountains are mostly very strong and not easily weathered; while the surrounding areas of famous mountains are often eroded into lowlands because the rocks there are easily weathered. Huangshan is like this, with solid granite forming the main peaks of Huangshan, and softer sedimentary rocks forming the surrounding gentle areas. The main bodies of other mountains such as the Western Mount Hua, Southern Mount Heng, Laoshan, and Jiuhua Mountain are all granite. This is not only because granite is strong, but also because granite is mostly formed when magma intrudes into the core of the uplifted part of the earth's crust during orogenic movements and solidifies, so it often resides among other rocks, and eventually becomes prominent peaks due to weathering. In addition to granite, other strong rocks can sometimes form famous mountains.
    Strange peaks can also rise abruptly from the plains due to faulting of the earth's crust, with some fault blocks rising to form mountains and others sinking, being covered with mud and sand to form plains. The Beijing Plain is such a plain, and the Western Hills are rising fault blocks. Mount Hua and Lushan also have this kind of activity.
    In China's geological history, crustal movements have been frequent and dramatic, which is the fundamental reason why there are so many high mountains and famous mountains. However, the majestic and complex forms of famous mountains are also due to the destructive and transporting effects of sunlight, wind, water, and other elements. The strangeness of Huangshan, for example, is due to glacial activity in the most recent period of Earth's history. The destructive power of glaciers sliding is enormous, almost like a steel knife planing the earth's crust, scraping mountain valleys into trough shapes, making mountain peaks sharp like horns, and mountain ridges steep like blades. And because the cliffs are steep, they can also cause the flowing water to fall thousands of feet, forming waterfalls.
    In the most recent historical period of the Earth, glaciers were widely distributed in China. Lushan, Tianmu Mountain, Jiuhua Mountain, Laoshan, Mount Hua, Mount Wutai, Mount Tai, Mount Emei... all had glacial activity, adding to the beauty of these famous mountains.
    In the past, these scenic and beautiful mountains in China were only for people to visit, but in fact, they have great economic and scientific significance. In recent years, minerals have been discovered in Mount Emei and Mount Wutai, and the solid rocks such as granite that make up famous mountains are often good building materials. The core stone of the Monument to the People's Heroes in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing was transported from Laoshan. In addition, due to the special climatic conditions in the mountains, such as high altitude and cloudiness, valuable medicinal materials, tea and other cash crops, as well as rare birds and animals, often grow there, making the mountains a good place to study biology, meteorology, and other subjects. The "People's Daily" once reported that Lushan has newly opened up tens of thousands of acres of cloud and mist tea gardens, planted a large number of fruit trees, and raised a large number of domestic animals. In addition to providing recreation, these famous mountains have new contributions. (Attached picture)

    名山不在高
    石工
    炎热的夏天到了，许多人在劳动之余到庐山、黄山这些名山里去休养、避暑。
    我国名山之多是世界少有的，这与我国多高山有关。但名山并不一定很高，黄山、庐山、天台、雁荡等都不过拔海一千多米，“登泰山而小天下”的泰山其实也只有一千五百多米。华山高到两千多米，五台山和峨嵋山超过了三千米，在名山中算很高的了。但是这些山要是移到青海西藏一带，不过是些极普通的山岭。但在那里，却只有登山运动员能上去，上去了也会因空气稀薄、气候寒冷而不能久留，不能成为游览休养的胜地。
    俗话说：“连林人不觉，独树众乃奇”，名山大多出现在拔海较低的地区中，大概也是这个原因。虽然山本身并不太高，但和周围的平地比起来，还是显得很突出。
    为什么平地会有奇峰突起呢？
    如果你仔细观察一下，便会发现构成名山的岩石大都很坚固，不易风化；而名山周围一带往往因为那里的岩石容易风化，以致被破坏成为低地。黄山就是如此，坚固的花岗岩构成了黄山主峰，较软的沉积岩形成了外围平缓地带。其他如西岳华山、南岳衡山、劳山、九华山等的主体都是花岗岩。这不仅因为花岗岩坚固，还因为花岗岩大多是造山运动时岩浆钻到地壳隆起部分的核心中冷凝而成，所以常居于别的岩石之中，而且最后受到风化，易成突兀的山峰。除了花岗岩，别的坚固的岩石有时也能构成名山。
    平地突起奇峰，还可以由于地壳发生了断裂，有的断块上升成山，有的断块下沉，被泥沙堆积成平原。北京平原就是这种平原，而西山是上升的断块。华山、庐山也有这种活动。
    我国在地质历史上地壳运动频繁而剧烈，这是高山和名山特别多的根本原因。但名山能有雄伟而复杂的形态，还得力于阳光、风、水等的破坏与搬运。如黄山之奇，便是因为在地球历史上最近时期内有过冰川活动。冰川滑动时的破坏力极大，简直有如钢刀在刨刮地壳，将山谷刨成槽形，使山峰尖锐如角，山脊峻削如刃。而由于山崖陡峭，更能使流水一跌千丈，形成飞瀑。
    在地球最近历史时期内，冰川在我国分布很广，庐山、天目山、九华山、劳山、华山、五台山、泰山、峨嵋山……等都有过冰川活动，为这些名山增色不少。
    我国的这些风景奇秀的名山，在过去不过是供人游览罢了，其实它们在经济上、科学上都有很大意义。近年来已在峨嵋山、五台山发现了矿产，而组成名山的花岗岩等坚固的岩石更常是良好的建筑材料。北京天安门前人民英雄纪念碑的碑心石就是从劳山运来的。此外，由于山中气候条件特殊，如高寒多云，因此常生长着名贵的药材、茶叶等经济作物以及珍禽奇兽，山中成了研究生物、气象等的好场所。“人民日报”曾经有消息说庐山新开辟了万亩云雾茶园，种植起大量果木，饲养了大批家禽。这些名山除了供人游乐而外，还有新的贡献。（附图片）
