　　National Spring Cocoon Harvest Bumper Crop
　　Sichuan Puts Forward the Slogan "Strive for Autumn Cocoon to Surpass Spring Cocoon"
　　(Our Report) Most regions of the country have had a bumper harvest of spring cocoons. The yield of mulberry silkworm cocoons increased by nearly 10% compared to the same period last year; the yield of tussah silkworm cocoons increased by about 60% compared to last year. In Xinjiang, Liaoning, Gansu, Jiangxi and other provinces and autonomous regions, the yield of mulberry silkworm cocoons, as well as the yield of mulberry and tussah silkworm cocoons in Henan Province, exceeded the total annual yield of last year in a single season. Jiangsu Province, an old mulberry silkworm area, saw an increase of over 20% in spring cocoons compared to last year.
　　This year, Party committees in various regions have further strengthened their leadership over cocoon production. Mulberry garden management in various regions has also been better than in previous years. Generally, winter and spring fertilizers have been applied to mulberry fields, and some regions have also applied top dressing fertilizer to the roots of mulberry trees. All high-yield areas have seized the opportunity this spring to implement technical measures such as disinfection and disease prevention, temperature and humidity control, feeding silkworms well with high-quality mulberry leaves, and raising silkworms in batches.
　　Currently, various regions are vigorously engaged in summer and autumn silkworm production, strengthening the cultivation and management of mulberry gardens, vigorously increasing mulberry leaf production, and preparing sufficient silkworm eggs.
　　(Our Report) "Strive for autumn cocoon to surpass spring cocoon" is the fighting slogan recently put forward at the Sichuan Sericulture Production Symposium held in Nanchong City.
　　This year, the total output of spring cocoons in Sichuan increased by 22% compared to the same season last year. Two special districts and Guang'an and other counties have exceeded last year's total cocoon output in spring alone, achieving "one season equals one year."
　　The meeting pointed out that the key to achieving autumn cocoons surpassing spring cocoons is: to establish the idea of high autumn cocoon yields; to vigorously increase mulberry leaf production so that autumn leaves surpass spring leaves; to arrange labor well, establish and improve specialized sericulture organizations, and carry out high work efficiency campaigns. Currently, many regions are carrying out pre-autumn silkworm preparations.

    全国春茧丰收
    四川提出“力争秋茧超春茧”战斗口号
    本报讯　全国大部分地区春茧丰收。桑蚕茧约比去年同期增产近一成；柞蚕茧比去年约增产六成左右。新疆、辽宁、甘肃、江西等省、自治区的桑蚕茧及河南省的桑蚕茧、柞蚕茧，都是一季产量超过去年全年的产量。老桑蚕区的江苏省今年春茧比去年增产二成多。
    今年，各地党委都进一步加强了对蚕茧生产的领导。各地桑园管理也比往年好，一般桑田都施了冬肥和春肥，有些地区还在桑树根外追肥。凡是丰产地区，今春都抓紧了消毒防病、调节温湿度、良桑饱食、分批饲养等技术措施。
    目前，各地正在大搞夏秋蚕生产，加强桑园的培育管理，大力增产桑叶，并准备了足够的蚕种。
    本报讯　“力争秋茧超春茧”，这是最近在南充市召开的四川蚕桑生产座谈会上提出的战斗口号。
    今年四川春蚕茧总产量比去年同季增长22％。有两个专区和广安等县春季总产茧量都超过去年总产量，实现了“一季顶一年”。
    会议指出，实现秋茧超春茧的关键是：树立秋茧高产的思想；大力增产桑叶，使秋叶超春叶；安排好劳力，建立和健全蚕桑专业组织，开展高工效运动。目前不少地区正在进行秋蚕蚕前的准备工作。
