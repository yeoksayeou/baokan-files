    Why the Red Flag is Raised Higher and Higher

    The cadres and masses of the Muyang People's Commune in Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, with their vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, hold high the red flag and forge ahead bravely! This is an outstanding pacesetter in agricultural production. Here, a lively and vigorous political situation and a prosperous scene have emerged: production competitions are developing wave after wave; people talk freely about the situation and criticize the mood of slackening; crops are weeded and hoed in a timely manner, with sufficient fertilizer, and a bumper harvest is in sight; poultry, livestock, and sideline production are developing greatly, and the income of commune members has generally increased; collective canteens are run well, saving hundreds of thousands of catties of grain to support other areas. ...

    Aren't some people now experiencing a mood of slackening? Aren't some people hesitating in the face of difficulties? They badly need to see and hear how those advanced communes are leading the masses to overcome difficulties. The most important thing is "putting politics in command." Under the correct leadership of the Party, they vigorously carry out mass movements, strengthen ideological work, grasp the ideological situation of the masses at any time and any place, analyze it according to the Party's line and policies, and mobilize the masses to debate, so as to carry forward the correct ideas and overcome the incorrect ones. In this way, they distinguish right from wrong and clear the obstacles on the road forward. At the same time, they focus on measures in production, carry out appraisal and competition, and set up pacesetters to drive the backward forward. It is precisely because the Muyang Commune has done this that it can raise the red flag higher and higher.

    红旗何以越举越高
    贵州绥阳县募阳人民公社的干部和群众以旺盛的革命热情，高举红旗，奋勇直前！这是一支农业生产中的优秀标兵。在这里出现了生动活泼的政治局面和一片兴旺的景象：生产竞赛一浪赶过一浪地向前发展；人们大讲形势，批判松劲情绪，真是畅所欲言；庄稼薅锄及时，肥料足，丰收在望；家禽、家畜和副业生产大发展，社员收入普遍增加；集体食堂办得好，又节约了几十万斤粮食支援外地。……
    现在不是有些人产生了松劲情绪吗？不是有些人在困难面前徘徊不前吗？他们很需要看一看、听一听那些先进公社是怎样领导群众战胜困难的。其中最重要的一条就是“政治挂帅”。他们在党的正确领导下大搞群众运动，加强思想工作，随时随地掌握群众的思想情况，根据党的路线、政策进行分析，发动群众辩论，把正确的思想发扬起来，把不正确的思想克服下去，这样就分清了是非，也就扫清了前进道路上的障碍。同时，在生产中大抓措施，开展评比竞赛，树立标兵，带动落后。募阳公社正是由于做到了这一点，所以能把红旗越举越高。
