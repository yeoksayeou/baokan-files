    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 12th: The employees of the steelmaking department of the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant launched a "Three Dragons Competition" with daily evaluations in August. The plant exceeded the steel production plan for the first ten days of the month by 5.4%, and the qualification rate of steel ingots reached 98.67%.

    The "Three Dragons Competition" in this factory takes the open-hearth furnace as the "dragon head," the pig iron furnace and steel casting as the "dragon body," and the crane, transportation, and material selection sections as the "dragon tail." The workers in these processes are divided into three shifts, A, B, and C, to form a dragon to carry out the competition. The main evaluation criteria for the competition are output, quality, safety, raw material consumption, smelting time, etc. Each dragon evaluates and announces the results daily based on these criteria.

    After the launch of this competition, it greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the employees. All teams have formulated competition plans, determined to work hard in August and September to win the red flag and welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day. Qi Zisheng's team of No. 1 open-hearth furnace in Class B created a method of pre-slagging, which shortened the smelting time of each furnace of steel by half an hour. Yu Junyou's team in Class C learned from their experience and surpassed Qi Zisheng's team the next day. Qi Zisheng's team then surpassed Yu Junyou with the result of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours and twenty-nine minutes. Class B, which won the red flag three times in a row on August 9, was surpassed by Chen Yiyou and Wang Qifa's team in Class A. In the competition, all teams further strengthened cooperation. At the important moment of tapping steel, each open-hearth furnace sent people to support each other.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Lushun, August 12th: The employees of the Dalian Steel Plant fought hard in August and got off to a flying start. The steel output in the first ten days exceeded the ten-day plan by 6.5%, and the average daily output increased by 5.52% compared with July; the quality of the steel also improved.

    Since the beginning of August, this factory has launched a red flag competition for high yield, high quality, low cost, and safety. The workers in each workshop have generally set the leap forward targets and specific measures for August through skill competitions. The steelmaking workshop workers strengthened the pre-furnace meetings, summarizing experience after smelting each furnace of steel, and immediately improved the problems found, thus greatly shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel, achieving both high yield and high quality. The steelmaking workers of the No. 1 steelmaking workshop strictly implemented the operating procedures, overcame the difficulties of high phosphorus and sulfur content in the furnace charge, and produced ten to twenty tons more electric furnace steel than the work plan every day.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 12th: The mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau overfulfilled the state production plan for the first ten days of August. Compared with the same period last month, raw coal production increased by 33.2%, and tunneling footage increased by 31%.

    In the past, the mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau had a long-term passive situation in production where they were relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month. In order to reverse this situation, since the end of July, the bureau has been grasping tightly at all times, grasping tightly every day, grasping tightly throughout the month, and striving for an all-round red spirit. First, it criticized the right-leaning thinking and slackening emotions existing in a few cadres, and promoted the vigorous red flag competition of finding opponents, setting up pacesetters, and catching up with each other through comparing enthusiasm and comparing advanced achievements. In addition to the party committee secretary and mine manager personally directing production at the front line, the mines also transferred a group of cadres from various departments to go deep into the mines to lead; the time for checking the operation plan was changed from once every eight hours in the past to once every hour. Every night, the director presided over the inter-mine competition evaluation meeting to promptly evaluate the red flag units, summarize and promote their advanced experience.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 12th: In the coal grabbing battle in the first ten days of August, the coal mine workers in Heilongjiang Province achieved an average daily output of 74,199 tons of raw coal, which is more than 10,000 tons more than the average daily output in the same period last month; the tunneling footage has also been improved compared with the same period in July.

    In order to seize the completion of the production plan from the beginning of the month, the Shuangyashan, Jixi, and Hegang coal mines arranged the coal production work for August in advance. In view of the past problems such as the monthly plan being issued late, many meetings in the first ten days of the month, and the leaders spending less time going deep into the front line, the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau implemented the August plan to each mine, well, and working face in late July, so that the workers would have a clear understanding.

    The mines also organized veteran workers, engineering technicians, and mine cadres from coal mining, tunneling, machinery and electricity, and transportation to form investigation teams to go deep into the mine to comprehensively check and solve various problems existing in the coal mining and tunneling sites, so that production could be rapidly improved.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, August 12th: In the first ten days of August, the output of steel and coal in Benxi City increased significantly compared with the same period in July. Among them, steel increased by 29.9% compared with the same period in July, pig iron increased by 2.9%, and coal increased by 5.5%; the quality of products has also been improved to varying degrees. At the same time, the employees of the transportation front also won a great victory, and steel, iron, and coal all completed the state's transfer plan ahead of schedule. They also rushed to transport tens of thousands of tons of steel that had been backlogged last month.

    The Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently conducted a thorough inspection of the industrial and mining enterprises in the city, and mobilized various factories and party committees to jointly organize three working groups for steel, coal, and transportation, to go deep into the relatively backward units, participate in production, lead production, and quickly change the production appearance of these units. In order to strengthen the leadership of the production of day and night shift workers, many units have also established a three-shift duty system for leading cadres.

    Since August, there have been continuous heavy rains in Benxi area, which has brought great difficulties to production and transportation. The employees of many factories were enthusiastic and, while producing and fighting floods, ensured the normal operation of production and broke many records. The twelve-ton converter of the No. 1 Steel Plant was newly put into production at the end of last year. On August 9, in order to increase the production of steel ingots, the workers of Wang Ganchen's class furnace team strengthened mutual assistance and cooperation, not only ensuring the timely supply of molten iron, but also achieving "no leakage and no steel running," greatly reducing the loss of molten iron. As a result, the class smelted eleven furnaces of 179 tons of steel, and the quality of steel ingots reached 100%, creating the highest record since the converter was built.

    乘胜前进　定要中旬超上旬
　　八月头十天又一批厂矿报捷
　　天津
    据新华社天津12日电　天津第一钢厂炼钢部职工进入8月掀起一天一评比的“三条龙竞赛”，全厂超额5.4％完成了上旬钢产量计划，钢锭的合格率达到98.67％。
    这个工厂的“三条龙竞赛”是以平炉为“龙头”，化铁炉、铸钢为“龙体”，天车、运输、拣料等工段作为“龙尾”。把这些工序的工人，按甲乙丙三个班次分别组成为一条龙展开竞赛。竞赛的主要评比条件是产量、质量、安全、原材料消耗、熔炼时间等，每条龙都根据这些条件天天评比和公布结果。
    这一竞赛开展以后，大大激发了职工们的干劲。各个班组纷纷制订竞赛计划，决心大干8、9月，夺取优胜红旗迎接国庆十周年。乙班一号平炉齐子升小组创造了提前造渣的操作方法，使每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短了半个小时。丙班于俊友小组学习了他们的经验，在第二天就超过了齐子升小组。齐子升小组又以六时二十九分炼一炉钢的成绩，超过了于俊友。8月9日一连夺取三次红旗的乙班，又被甲班的陈益友、王起发小组所超过。竞赛中，各个小组都进一步加强了协作。在出钢的重要时刻，各平炉互相派人支援。
　　旅大
    据新华社旅大12日电　大连钢厂职工奋战8月，旗开得胜。头十天的钢产量超额6.5％完成了旬计划，平均日产量比7月份增长了5.52％；钢的质量也有提高。
    这个厂从8月初起便掀起了热火朝天的高产、优质、低成本、保安全的红旗竞赛。各车间的工人通过比武大会普遍订出了8月份的跃进指标和具体措施。炼钢车间的工人们加强了炉前会，做到炼完一炉钢，就总结一次经验，发现问题立即改进，因此大大缩短了每炉钢的冶炼时间，做到了既高产又优质。第一炼钢车间炼钢工人严格执行操作规程，战胜了炉料含磷、硫成分较高的困难，每天都比作业计划多炼十吨到二十吨左右的电炉钢。
　　焦作
    新华社郑州12日电　焦作矿务局所属各矿超额完成8月上旬的国家生产计划。同上月同期比较，原煤产量提高33.2％，掘进进尺增加31％。
    焦作矿务局所属各矿过去在生产上长期存在着月初松月末紧的被动局面。为了扭转这种情况，这个局从7月底开始，以时时抓紧、日日抓紧、全月都抓紧、力争满堂红的精神，首先批判了在少数干部中存在着的右倾思想和松劲情绪，并且通过比干劲，比先进，促使各区、班、组开展了轰轰烈烈的找对手、立标兵、你追我赶的红旗竞赛热潮。各矿除党委书记和矿长亲临前线指挥生产外，并从各部门抽调了一批干部，深入矿井领导；把检查作业计划的时间由过去八小时一次改为一小时一次。每天晚上，局长都主持召开矿际竞赛评比会，及时评比红旗单位，总结和推广他们的先进经验。
　　黑龙江
    新华社哈尔滨12日电　黑龙江省煤矿职工，在8月份头十天的夺煤大战中，获得了原煤平均日产七万四千一百九十九吨的成绩，比上月份同期每天平均多产一万多吨煤；掘进进尺也比7月份同期有所提高。
    为了在月初一开始就抓紧完成生产计划，双鸭、鸡西、鹤岗三大煤矿都提早安排了8月份的煤炭生产工作。双鸭矿务局针对过去月计划下达晚，上旬会议多，领导干部深入第一线的时间少等情况，在7月下旬就把8月份的计划落实到各矿、井、工作面，使职工心中有数。
    各矿井还组织了采煤、掘进、机电、运输等工种中的老工人、工程技术人员和矿井干部，成立摸底小组，深入井下全面检查和解决采煤、掘进场子存在的各种问题，使生产迅速提高。
　　本溪
    据新华社本溪12日电　8月份头十天，本溪市钢铁、煤炭的产量都比7月同期有显著增长。其中，钢比7月同期增长29.9％，生铁增长2.9％，煤炭增长5.5％；产品质量也都有不同程度的提高。与此同时，运输战线职工也打了一个大胜仗，钢、铁、煤炭都提前完成了国家的调运计划。还把上月积压的几万吨钢铁抢运了出去。
    中共本溪市委最近对全市的工矿企业作了一次深入的检查，并且发动各工厂，党委共同组织了钢铁、煤炭、交通运输三个工作组，深入比较落后的单位，参加生产，领导生产，迅速改变了这些单位的生产面貌。为了加强对日夜班工人生产的领导，许多单位还建立了领导干部的三班值班制。
    8月份以来，本溪地区连日暴雨，给生产、运输带来了很大的困难。许多工厂职工干劲冲天，在一面生产，一面防汛的情况下，保证了生产的正常进行，并且刷新了许多纪录。第一钢铁厂十二吨转炉，是去年年底新投入生产的。8月9日那天，王干臣班炉前小组工人为了多增产钢锭，加强了互助协作，不仅保证铁水及时供应，而且做到“不漏泡、不跑钢”，大大减少了铁水的损耗，因而一班就炼出了十一炉一百七十九吨钢，钢锭质量达到100％，创造了转炉建炉以来的最高纪录。
