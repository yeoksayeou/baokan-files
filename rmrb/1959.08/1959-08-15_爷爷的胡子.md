    Grandpa's Beard
  　Lí Shèngmín
    Little Hua, swinging the two large pink butterflies on her braids, ran into the house shouting, clutching her stomach and laughing uncontrollably. In her hand, she held up a messy clump of something.

      "Look at you, silly girl. The shock brigade is about to leave, and you're still acting crazy. What's making you so happy?" Grandma took a steaming tray of dumplings from the pot, placed it on the table, adjusted her reading glasses on her nose, and glanced at her.

    I took the messy clump from Little Hua's hand. It turned out to be a handful of recently shaved, grizzled beard. I was strangely stunned and didn't say anything for a long time.

    Suddenly, a voice like a bronze bell came from outside: "That child deserves a spanking, no respect for elders!" Then Grandpa strode in from outside.

    Good heavens! When I saw him, I was even more astonished. A brand new blue cotton padded jacket, new cotton pants, new snow-white thousand-layer-soled shoes, even the socks were the pair Grandma had just made a few days ago. He was wearing a wide cloth belt around his waist. Dressed so neatly and nimbly, the old man looked extremely energetic, just like a young lad. Then, when I saw Grandpa's shiny chin, I couldn't help but raise the handful of beard in my hand, and I suddenly understood.

    Grandpa stood on the floor, pointing at my younger sister, Little Hua, who was covering her face and laughing, afraid to look at him, and loudly rebuked: "Guangxing and you young people go all over the country! Aren't we old folks allowed to move our arms and legs? Quick, quick! Hurry up and give it to me! Give it to me!" Grandpa stretched out his hand, asking Little Hua for something.

    Grandma scrutinized Grandpa's attire, from top to bottom, for the length of two pipefuls of tobacco without making a sound. Finally, her gaze moved to Grandpa's chin, and she didn't move it again.

    In that instant, an unforgettable scene from more than a decade ago flashed before my eyes.

    It was a bitterly cold night in the winter of 1943. Grandpa was captured by the Japanese devils and forced to carry stretchers. When he returned, he was beaten black and blue, covered in blood. Grandma cried and nagged at his side: "Stay! Just stay!" At the time, I didn't know what she meant, but I only saw that from that day on, Grandpa never shaved his beard again. However, I was still wondering: Why, before that day, did Grandpa often say: "I'm strong, not deaf, and my eyesight is good. I can work hard for several more decades... how can I grow a beard to pretend to be an old man?"

    More than a decade has passed, and without realizing it, quite a few silver-white strands had been mixed into Grandpa's thick beard.

    Ever since the liberation, Grandpa has been constantly complaining and getting angry because of this beard! Whether it was in the mutual aid team, the cooperative, or today's People's Commune, just because of this beard, everyone, whether it was the secretary, the director, the team leader, even the young lads and girls, would say: "Old man, let the young people do the more difficult and heavier tasks! You should do something lighter!" Of course, Grandpa never showed weakness, let alone admitted defeat. Besides trying hard to argue with them, he would sometimes flex his arms and compete with the young people. But he could never convince them.

    Therefore, Grandpa felt that this beard had become a burden that prevented him from displaying his full abilities, holding him back. So, he always wanted to find an opportunity to shave it off.

    "I almost didn't recognize you!" Grandma scooped a bowl of fragrant dumplings and brought it to Grandpa, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

    Grandpa laughed heartily: "See, I look decades younger? This time, the old general is going into battle. When I come back, I'll be a canal-building model, and you'll be honored too!" I knew Grandpa was teasing Grandma.

      "Hey!" As Grandpa's loud voice fell, the pleasant sound of trumpets and drums came from afar. "Listen! Listen! The shock brigade is about to set off!" He pushed the chopsticks and bowl onto the table, grabbed Grandma and ran outside, saying incessantly, "Let's go! Let's go! Today, the old general is going on an expedition, and his old wife is seeing him off."

  After Grandpa and Grandma went outside, Little Hua suddenly woke up from a dream and ran after them, shouting loudly: "Grandpa, Grandpa, your letter of introduction! Your shock brigade member card!"

    I also chased after them. The crowd sending them off on the street was crowded and bustling with excitement.

    Grandpa straightened his chest and walked into the ranks of the shock brigade with Little Hua. A mighty and spirited water conservancy army marched towards the distance.

    爷爷的胡子
  　黎盛民
    小华甩着辫子上的两只大粉红蝴蝶，高声嚷着，跑进屋来，捂着肚子爬在炕沿上，“咯咯咯”地笑个不休，手里高举着一团乱蓬蓬的东西。
      “看你这个傻丫头，眼看着突击队就要出发了，你还在疯疯颠颠的，什么事儿乐得你这样呀？”奶奶从锅上端下一屉热气腾腾的饺子，放在桌子上，用手挪了挪鼻梁上的老花镜，瞥了她一眼。
    我接过小华手里的那团乱东西，原来是一把刚才剃下来的花白胡子。我奇怪地怔住了，老半天没说出话来。
    忽然，外面传来了铜钟般的声音：“该打的丫头蛋子，没大没小的！……”接着爷爷从外面大步地闯了进来。
    吓嗬！我一见，更惊奇得目瞪口呆了。新青市布棉袄，新棉裤，新的雪白千层底的鞋，连袜子也是奶奶前几天刚给做好的那双，腰里还捆着一条宽布腰带，打扮得轻巧、俐落，老人家显得精干极了，活像一个年青小伙子。接着当我看到爷爷那油光发亮的下巴时，不禁举起手上的那把胡子，才恍然大悟了。
    爷爷站在屋地上，指着捂着脸笑得不敢看人的妹妹小华，大声责备：“光兴你们年轻人走南闯北的！就不许我们老头子动动胳臂腿？快，快！快拿来！快给我！……”爷爷伸着手在向小华要什么。
    奶奶端详着爷爷的穿着，由上到下，足有两袋烟的工夫没有吱声，最后目光移到爷爷的下巴上，再也不动了。

    就在这一刹那，十几年前难忘的一幕在我眼前闪过。
    那是1943年冬的一个严寒的夜晚，爷爷被鬼子抓去抬担架回来，浑身被打得皮开肉绽，鲜血淋漓。奶奶在一旁哭泣着唠叨：“留下吧！留下吧！……”当时我不知道是什么意思，只看见从那一天起，爷爷再也没有剃过胡子。但是，我心中却仍然在奇怪：为什么在这一天以前，常听爷爷说：“身强力壮，耳不聋眼不花，再好好地干上他几十年……怎能留下胡子装老头子呢？”
    十几年的岁月过去了，不知不觉，在爷爷浓密的胡子里已经掺进了不少银白色。
    自从翻身以后，爷爷可就是因为这把胡子，没短了发牢骚、生大气呀！无论是在互助组里、合作社里以及今天的人民公社里，就因为有了这把胡子，无论书记、主任、队长，就是连那些小伙子和姑娘们都这样说：“老大爷，多的重的让给青年人去做吧！您还是干一些轻的吧！”当然爷爷从不示弱，更不认输，除了努力地和他们争辩而外，还有时伸出胳臂同青年人较量较量。但是总不能说服他们。
    因此，爷爷觉得这把胡子成了他满身本领不能施展的累赘，拉住了他的后腿。所以，他总想找个机会剃掉它。

    “差一点不认识你了！”奶奶盛了一碗香喷喷的饺子，送到爷爷跟前，哭不得笑不得地说。
    爷爷哈哈大笑：“看，年轻了几十年？这回老将出马，回来我当上个修渠模范，你也光荣啊！”我知道爷爷在逗奶奶笑。
      “嘿！”随着爷爷宏亮的嗓音一落，悦耳的喇叭声和锣鼓声从远方传来。“听！听！突击队马上就出发了！”他把筷子碗往桌上一推：拉着奶奶就往外奔，嘴里不住地说，“走！走！今天老将出征，老婆子相送。”
  等爷爷和奶奶走出门外，小华忽然从梦中惊醒似的跑着追上去，大声喊：“爷爷，爷爷，给您介绍信！给您突击队员证！……”
    我也跟着追出去。街上欢送的人群拥拥挤挤，欢腾鼓舞。
    爷爷挺起了胸脯，和小华一起大步地走进了突击队的行列。一支雄赳赳气昂昂的水利大军浩浩荡荡地奔向远方。
