    Slums Surge in New York
    An article in the "New York Times" regarding New York's slums points out that more than one million of New York City's eight million residents live in slums.
    The article states that slums in New York are continuing to increase, and there are many more families living in slums than there were nine years ago. According to materials from the City Planning Commission, there are currently 325,000 to 350,000 substandard housing units in New York.
    The newspaper wrote that, according to statistics from the Chairman of the Slum Clearance Committee, Moleas, New York slums cover seven thousand acres. Housing construction according to the established plan cannot keep up with the rate of slum growth. Moreover, the corruption and bribery of government officials has also led to the preservation of the dirtiest slums.

    纽约贫民窟激增
    “纽约时报”刊载的一篇关于纽约贫民窟的文章指出，在纽约市的八百多万人口中，有一百多万居住在贫民窟里。
  文章说，目前纽约的贫民窟在继续增加，居住在贫民窟的家庭比九年前多得多。根据城市计划委员会的材料，纽约现在有三十二万五千至三十五万所住房不符合标准。
    报纸写道，据消灭贫民窟委员会主席莫列士统计，纽约贫民窟占地七千英亩。按照已制定的计划进行住宅建设，不可能赶上贫民窟的增长速度。而且，政府官员的贪污受贿还促使最肮脏的贫民窟被保留下来。
