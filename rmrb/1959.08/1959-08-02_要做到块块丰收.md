    To Achieve Overall Bumper Harvests

    Any work requires methods, and field management is no exception. To do a good job in field management, we must also oppose the following two undesirable approaches. One is "grabbing both the eyebrows and the beard" – treating everything the same without distinction. With this approach, third-class seedlings always remain third-class seedlings, with no possibility of catching up with first-class or second-class seedlings. The other is "treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it aches" – dealing with problems only when they arise. As a result, while managing third-class seedlings, second-class seedlings are forgotten. Many third-class seedlings are upgraded to first-class or second-class seedlings due to strengthened management, but many second-class seedlings are also downgraded to third-class seedlings because of relaxed management.

    The correct method is to pay attention to both the overall situation and key points. When strengthening field management of mid-season rice, Jiangyin County adopted this approach. They first analyzed and ranked the growth of mid-season rice, identifying improving the lagging condition of third-class seedlings as the priority. However, they did not relax the management of first-class and second-class seedlings. In specific work, they focused on fertilization, implementing targeted fertilization for third-class seedlings, and skillful and universal fertilization for first and second-class seedlings respectively. While fertilizing, they also strengthened water management and pest and disease control. In a series of tasks, they ensured that attention was paid to key points in everything and to the overall situation at all times. No wonder the growth of mid-season rice in the county changed comprehensively in just one week.

    This method should be adopted for the management of all autumn-harvest crops. Only in this way can we achieve bumper harvests of all autumn crops, field by field, this year.

### 要做到块块丰收

    要做到块块丰收
    做什么工作，都要讲究方法，田间管理也不例外。要做好田间管理工作，也要反对以下两种不好的方法，一种是“眉毛胡子一把抓”，不加区别，一律对待。这样做，三类苗一直是三类苗，没有可能赶上一类苗或二类苗。另一种是“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”，事情来了才办，不来不办。结果，管了三类苗，忘了二类苗，不少三类苗固然因为加强了管理而上升为一类苗或二类苗，但是也有不少二类苗因为放松了管理而降为三类苗。
    正确的方法，既注意全面，又注意重点。江阴县在加强中稻田间管理的时候，就采取了这种办法。他们首先对中稻生长情况进行了分析、排队，确定了以改变三类苗的落后状况为重点；但又不放松对一类苗、二类苗的管理。在具体工作中，以施肥为重点，对三类苗实行重点施肥，对一、二类苗分别做到巧施和普施肥料。在施肥的同时，又加强了用水管理、防治病虫害等工作。在一系列的工作中，做到了：事事注意重点，时时注意全面。难怪在短短的一周内，这个县的中稻生长情况全面改变。
    对一切秋收作物的管理工作，都要采取这个方法。只有这样，才可以做到今年秋季作物样样丰收，块块丰收。
