    The Man Who Hasn't Produced a Defective Product in Six Years

　　Ma Caishu, a grinder in the First United Processing Workshop of the Jinan Second Machine Tool Factory, has not produced a single defective or substandard product in the six years since he became independent after completing his apprenticeship in January 1953. He has exceeded his production quota every month and has become a red flag for high quality and high output in the entire factory. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Zhiping
