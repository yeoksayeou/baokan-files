　　Lumumba Demands Immediate Independence for the Congo
    Leopoldville dispatch: Patrice Lumumba, Chairman of the Congolese National Movement, demanded the immediate establishment of a Congolese government at a press conference in Leopoldville on the 6th, calling on the Congolese people to "rise up and fight for immediate independence."
    Lumumba made these remarks when he denounced the recent arrest by the Belgian colonial authorities in Luluabourg, Congo, of Kalonji, chairman of the party's Kasai Provincial Committee, and other African leaders. He pointed out that the real reason for Kalonji's arrest was his political beliefs and his earlier speech at a press conference in Brussels. In his speech at the time, Kalonji demanded the immediate establishment of an interim government in the Congo. He also said that the Congolese people did not trust Cornelis, the Belgian Governor-General in the Congo.

　　卢蒙巴要求刚果立即独立
    利奥波德维尔消息：刚果民族运动党主席卢蒙巴6日在利奥波德维尔的一次记者招待会上，要求立即成立一个刚果政府，呼吁刚果人“起来争取立即独立”。
    卢蒙巴是在指责比利时殖民当局最近在刚果路路阿堡逮捕他的党开赛省委员会主席卡隆吉和其他非洲人领袖时说这番话的。他指出，卡隆吉被捕的真正原因是他的政治信念和他早些时候在布鲁塞尔的一次记者招待会上的讲话。卡隆吉当时在讲话中要求立即在刚果成立一个临时政府。并且还说过，刚果人民不信任比利时在刚果的总督科内利斯。
