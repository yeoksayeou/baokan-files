    A Day in Summer Vacation Life
    The sun had just risen when a group of innocent and lively children gathered in a square to do morning exercises. This is a Young Pioneers team from a worker's dormitory of the central government agencies, and they are starting their day of summer vacation.
    The club is the central place for the children to spend their summer vacation happily. Here, there are various children's books and toys. A young counselor is explaining with an airplane model to the children, who are listening attentively.
    The children in this dormitory spend their summer vacation meaningfully and in an orderly manner. They have a certain amount of time each day for studying, working in small groups of three to five, reviewing their lessons with the help of a counselor. They also have a certain amount of time for singing, dancing, playing games, or listening to the radio and visiting places. In addition to collective activities, they also help their mothers with housework.
    When the sun is about to set, the children gather together and sing their favorite song "Socialism is Good" to end the day's activities. (Attached pictures)

    暑假生活一日
    太阳刚刚升起，一群天真活泼的孩子，便聚集在一块广场上作起早操。这是中直机关一个工人宿舍的少年儿童中队，他们开始了一天的暑假生活。
    俱乐部是孩子们欢度暑假的中心场所。在这里，陈设着各种儿童读物和玩具。一位年轻的辅导员，正拿着一个飞机模型向孩子们讲解，孩子们都听得入迷。
    这个宿舍的孩子，暑假生活过得挺有意义，也很有秩序。他们每天都有一定的时间学习，三五人一小组，在辅导员的帮助下温习功课。也有一定的时间唱歌、跳舞、做游戏、或是听广播、参观。除了集体活动以外，他们还帮助妈妈做家务劳动。
    当太阳快要下山的时候，孩子们便在一起，唱孩子们最喜欢的“社会主义好”的歌子，结束了一天的活动。（附图片）
