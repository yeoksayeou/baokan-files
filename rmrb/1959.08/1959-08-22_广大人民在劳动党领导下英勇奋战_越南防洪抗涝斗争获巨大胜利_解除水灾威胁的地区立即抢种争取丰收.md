Hanoi Dispatch: The floodwaters in Vietnam's northern provinces of Thai Nguyen, Bac Giang, etc., have gradually receded to near normal levels; the severe threat of waterlogging in provinces such as Ha Nam, Thai Binh, and Nam Dinh has been largely lifted. The broad masses, cadres, and troops in the aforementioned areas, from August 2nd to August 14th, engaged in a heroic struggle against exceptionally heavy floods and severe waterlogging, and have achieved a great victory. Currently, on the fields in northern Vietnam that have been freed from the threat of floods and waterlogging, cadres, troops, and the people are rushing to replant new seedlings. The government has transported a large quantity of early-maturing rice seeds for them. Under the leadership of the Labor Party's village branches, a mass upsurge of rushing to plant, accumulating fertilizer, eliminating pests, and striving for a bumper harvest has been launched in these areas.

This year, the climate in northern Vietnam has been abnormal. In early August, rainfall in the plains and mountainous areas increased sharply. The normal rainfall in previous years was generally only 800 millimeters, but now it has increased to more than 1,000 millimeters. The sudden increase in rainfall and the drastic change in climate caused mountain torrents to erupt, and the floods surged towards the plains. The water levels of major rivers have generally risen. The water level of the Cau River, a tributary of the Red River, reached 28.11 meters, 38 centimeters higher than the highest water level in Vietnamese hydrological history in 1907, seriously threatening a large area of ​​rice fields and villages in the provinces of Thai Nguyen, Bac Giang, Bac Kan, and Tuyen Quang.

The Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party and the Central Flood Control Committee of Vietnam immediately issued an "Emergency Flood Control Alert" to the disaster-stricken provinces. A delegation composed of some members of the Party Central Committee and ministers also went to the disaster areas to inspect and lead the people in fighting the floods.

Tens of thousands of cadres, People's Army soldiers, and ordinary people stood in waist-deep water for long periods to repair river dikes. In Phu Binh County, Thai Nguyen Province, more than 4,000 people braved the rain at night to raise a five-kilometer-long dangerous dike section by one meter, saving more than 1,000 hectares of rice fields.

The People's Army rescued disaster victims and grain in the affected villages. Their selfless spirit of serving the people has been widely praised by the farmers. An old farmer in Phu Binh County said to a village cadre: "Because of the leadership of the Labor Party and the Republic government, the people can overcome this biggest flood in the past 50 years."

In mid-August, when mountain torrents surged towards some areas of the plains, they caused waterlogging in the plains. In the disaster-stricken areas of Ha Nam, Nam Dinh, and Thai Binh provinces, tens of thousands of people worked day and night to dig hundreds of small ditches and ponds, and worked hard to scoop water out, draining the accumulated water into ditches, ponds, and large rivers, saving most of the waterlogged rice.

According to people from the Vietnam Ministry of Water Conservancy, this year, many counties and villages have built thousands of small reservoirs, ditches, and sluice gates, which have greatly reduced waterlogging. Some villages in Bac Giang Province and Hung Yen Province have vigorously developed small-scale water conservancy this year, so that almost all the rice fields in these areas have been spared from waterlogging.

　　广大人民在劳动党领导下英勇奋战
    越南防洪抗涝斗争获巨大胜利
    解除水灾威胁的地区立即抢种争取丰收
    本报河内21日电　越南北方太原、北江等省的洪水已经逐渐退落到差不多正常的水位；河南、太平、南定等省的水涝的严重威胁，已经基本上解除。上述地区的广大人民、干部和部队从8月2日到8月14日同特大洪水和严重水涝进行的一场英勇搏斗，已经取得了巨大胜利。目前，在解除了洪水和水涝威胁的越南北方田地上，干部、部队和人民正在抢种新苗。政府为他们运来了大量早熟的稻种。在劳动党乡支部的领导下，这些地区已经掀起了群众性的抢种、积肥、除虫、争取丰收的热潮。今年越南北方气候反常。8月初，平原和山区的雨量骤增。往年正常雨量一般只有八百毫米，现在增至一千多毫米。雨量的骤增和气候的剧变使山洪暴发，洪水朝着平原地区猛泻。主要河流的水位都普遍上涨。红河支流桥河的水位达到二十八点一一米，比越南水文史上水位最高的1907年高出三十八厘米，严重威胁着太原、北江、北?、宣光等省一大片稻田和乡村。
    越南劳动党中央和越南中央防洪委员会立即向灾区各省发出了“抗洪紧急警报”。由一部分党中央委员和部长组成的代表团还前往灾区视察，领导人民同洪水搏斗。
    成千上万的干部、人民军战士和老百姓长时间站在没腰的水里抢修河堤。在太原省普安县，四千多人夜里冒雨把五公里长的危险的堤段加高了一米，挽救了一千多公顷的稻田。
    人民军在受灾的村庄里，抢救灾民和粮食。他们奋不顾身地为人民服务的精神受到了农民们的普遍赞扬。普安县一位老农对乡干部说：“因为有了劳动党和共和国政府的领导，人民才能战胜这五十年来最大的洪水。”
    8月中旬，当山洪向着平原一些地区猛泻时，造成了平原地区的水涝。河南、南定、太平等省受灾地区成万人民夜以继日地挖了数以百计的小水沟和水塘，并且奋力戽水，把积涝排除到水沟、水塘和大河里去，救活了大部分受涝的水稻。
    据越南水利部人士说，今年，许多县和乡修筑了数以千计的小型蓄水池、水沟和水闸，大大减轻了涝情。北江省和兴安省一部分乡今年大力发展小型水利，使得这些地区的稻田几乎全部免除了涝害。（附图片）
