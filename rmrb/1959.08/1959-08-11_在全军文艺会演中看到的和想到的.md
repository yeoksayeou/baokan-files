    An Exciting Harvest

    The Second Arts Festival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has concluded, and the harvest is great. Speaking solely from the perspective of drama, there are many programs that can be described as ideologically healthy and thematically clear. There have also been certain achievements in terms of structure and language. In terms of performance, direction, and stage art, a relatively high level has been reached. In terms of form, it is indeed rich and diverse. From the perspective of creative thought, the majority of works follow the creative method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism. For example, the thematic handling and plot arrangement of the dance dramas "Five Red Clouds" and "Butterfly Lovers"; the magnificent spirit of crossing the sea in wooden boats in "Song of the South China Sea"; the affection and indignation expressed in the poetry performances of "Under the Old Pear Tree," "Unforgettable Voyage," "Remembering General Yang Jingyu," and "The Story of the Fire Man"; the revolutionary enthusiasm and detailed character portrayals expressed in the dramas "Blazing Red Heart" and "Huai Village"; the magnificent spirit of declaring war on nature displayed in the dramas "Skillfully Embroidering Rivers and Mountains" and "Song of the Tarim"; the rich atmosphere of life and the depiction of the personality growth of new characters in plays like "Young Eagle," "General as a Soldier," and "Distant Menglongsha"; and the imaginative long shots in plays like "Breaking the Chains of Slavery," "Roads of May," and "Ten Thousand Miles of Rainbow"; the novelty of the scenes in the operas "Red Eagle" and "Green Mountains and Clear Waters" and the achievements in inheriting the expressive techniques of traditional opera; and the detailed descriptions of characters in "Eastward Advance Overture" and "Triumphant March." From these programs, we can see the progress of the army's literary and artistic work. Watching programs of various styles and content at the festival is as captivating as walking into a garden to see blooming flowers.

    Many excellent plays depict modern characters with flesh and blood, such as the male and female protagonists in the dance dramas "Five Red Clouds" and "Butterfly Lovers"; Ding Junzhang, Da Lao Liu, and Dongmei in "Song of the South China Sea"; Director Chen in "Eastward Advance Overture"; Xu Guoqing and Yang Mingcai in "Blazing Red Heart"; several soldier figures in "General as a Soldier"; the division commander and quartermaster in "Skillfully Embroidering Rivers and Mountains"; Granny Guo in "Huai Village"; and Huang Jiguang in the dance "Immortal Warrior." These new characters are complete and can inspire the audience to move forward. There have also been significant achievements in the depiction of negative characters, such as Liu Damaizi in "Eastward Advance Overture," the American captain in "On the 38th Parallel," and the old landlord in "Huai Village."

    Because the authors of many programs paid attention to depicting people, the directors placed the actions of people in the primary position in the plays, and the actors paid attention to expressing the unique personalities of the people in the plays, the audience's feelings are specific and profound. In the process of creation, the writers, directors, and actors clearly took the depiction of modern heroes, the party's loyal sons and daughters, as the goal of their creations. These plays depict their unyielding and tireless struggles during various periods of national liberation and construction, and their willingness to dedicate their lives without hesitation when necessary. In normal times, they are humble, serious, unpretentious, and not arrogant, and they do not retreat in the face of difficulties. The Party and the people of the whole country demand that our literary and artistic workers profoundly reflect reality and create works with both ideological and artistic merit to educate the people and help the growth of new morals. After seeing the festival, I feel that the army's literary and artistic workers have achieved certain achievements in this area. Some people say: Most of the large and good programs in the festival are historical themes. Can today's themes be written just as well? This suggestion is good, but I do not agree to regard the themes of our Party's leadership of the revolutionary struggle as distant and unattainable historical themes. Even if we perform Chinese and foreign historical dramas from thousands of years ago in the festival, as long as those historical dramas are instructive and inspiring to us today, it is not impossible to perform them. Moreover, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea are not distant history. One comrade said to me: After watching several plays in a row, it was like reviewing a history of the Chinese revolution. Seeing yesterday and thinking about today, it made us think of the wisdom of the Party and Chairman Mao, and feel the nobility of revolutionaries. It awakens us to think about whether there are some things in our daily work that we are sorry for our predecessors, and whether there are phenomena of selfishness, exaggeration, arrogance, retreat in the face of difficulties, or decline in revolutionary will. This is indeed worthy of our deep thought.

    In fact, the programs at the festival not only brilliantly depicted the actions of those immortal revolutionaries of yesterday, but also movingly depicted the soaring enthusiasm of today's revolutionaries after the national liberation. Plays such as "General as a Soldier," "Young Eagle," "Blazing Red Heart," "On the 38th Parallel," "Rose of Sharon," "Friendship," "Skillfully Embroidering Rivers and Mountains," "Emerald Island," and "Green Mountains and Clear Waters" depict revolutionary figures in defending national defense and declaring war on nature, and they express the invincible heroic spirit of the Chinese people in many ways.

    The Main Reasons for the Achievements

    Under the leadership of the Party and the military leaders, the army's literary and artistic workers resolutely implemented the Party's policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." After the rectification and anti-rightist movement last year, the General Political Department instructed all cultural troupes to go down to the companies for a short period as soldiers, or to go to factories and rural areas to deepen their lives and help develop amateur literary and artistic work. This has played a significant role in the leap forward in ideological and artistic achievements in this festival, both in professional and amateur creation and performance.

    The second reason for the achievements is the importance that Party committees and leaders at all levels in the army attach to literary and artistic work. Take the generals' amateur chorus as an example. Is this a small matter? Who has ever heard of more than a hundred battle-hardened, gray-haired generals singing in a chorus, and practicing in the hot weather, standing for one or two hours? This fully demonstrates their emphasis on the army's literary and artistic work and their cherishing of the tradition of our People's Liberation Army's literary and artistic work. Many people shed tears listening to the generals' amateur chorus, and I was one of them.

    Why did the old songs sung by the generals' amateur chorus elicit lasting applause from the audience? Some people say it is because the elderly are singing old songs, their lives are rich, their enthusiasm is full, and it is like old revolutionaries telling young people about their revolutionary experiences. The speaker speaks more and more excitedly, and the listener wants to hear more and more. This is indeed one of the main reasons for the touching nature, but I think that the important factor in the touching nature of the three songs "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," "On the Taihang Mountains," and "I Am a Soldier" is the most correct handling of the themes. The artistic shaping is also good. For example, singing "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" makes us feel that an army with strict discipline is advancing on the revolutionary journey with a magnificent spirit and heroic steps. "On the Taihang Mountains" takes us back to the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the people sent their sons and husbands to the front line to save the country. When singing to the optimistic mood of the guerrillas, "The mountains are high and the forests are dense, the soldiers are strong and the horses are strong," the listeners could not help but be excited by the heroic spirit that filled the mountains and rivers. At that time, many old comrades followed along with their hearts and bodies, truly achieving the integration of the thoughts and feelings of the performers and the listeners! At this moment, if we pay attention to the faces of the old soldiers on and off the stage, you will feel that they seem to be charging towards the enemy, going through fire and water with a spirit of fearlessness.

    Several Issues Worth Discussing

    The content of the work is the main thing. Some people say that after the rectification and anti-rightist movement, it is easy to require that a work have no errors in content. The reason is that all the works that came to participate in this festival have no political problems. Indeed, all the programs in the festival have no anti-socialist, anti-people, or anti-Party problems in content, but there are also some that exaggerate or are not fully in line with the Party's policies in individual places. Literature and art have attributes. It is a natural phenomenon for literary and artistic workers who are willing to serve the proletariat to reflect the Party's policies in their works, and even to reflect the long-term political goals, the current Party policies, and the spiritual outlook of the people. The long-term political goals and the current policies are inseparable. When authors are looking for themes, they always seriously select and arrange the most appropriate plots and characters, especially the positive characters. When a Party secretary or political commissar appears on the stage, the audience often regards their words and deeds as the Party's policies, so the author cannot prematurely and confidently say that there is no problem with the positive characters they create (especially those who represent the Party in speaking and doing things). Even if there is a very small problem, it will damage the original intention of the work and should be corrected. To give an example: The drama "Blazing Red Heart" created by Comrade Liu Chuan and others from the Nanjing Military Region's Cultural Troupe is a recognized good play since last year. It reflects the lofty spiritual outlook of the people in last year's Great Leap Forward—liberating their minds, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act; it writes about how the commanders and fighters of our army, whether in the army or in the local area, as long as it is for revolutionary work, as long as the Party assigns them to do something, no matter how many difficulties there are, they will try their best to overcome all difficulties to complete it. Several prominent characters in the play, such as the bureau chief, the factory director, and the deputy factory director, appear so unyielding, honest, and amiable in the specific dramatic scenes. From beginning to end, the work reflects the soaring enthusiasm of the Chinese people for building a socialist motherland with a magnificent spirit. We affirm that "Blazing Red Heart" is a good script. But I still disagree with some people who say that the revised "Blazing Red Heart" "has basically corrected the shortcomings in policy and thought, some of the characters' thoughts and behaviors have been rationalized, but the dramatic contradictions have been weakened and the passion has been somewhat subsided..." I will not talk about whether the rationalization of the characters' behaviors has led to the subsidence of dramatic contradictions and passions, but only whether the "Blazing Red Heart" that participated in this festival has no problems at all? Have all the characters' behaviors been rationalized? The one participating in the festival was revised, but many comrades still believe that some basic shortcomings have not been corrected. The demobilized soldier Xu Guoqing and others, who do not have much book knowledge, have never worked in industry, and have never even heard of what an electron tube is, have created electron tubes as soon as they start working on it. Qian Xuemei and people with technology cannot do it, which shows that Xu Guoqing and others have high political enthusiasm, soaring enthusiasm, perseverance, and they start a factory from scratch and bravely march towards difficulties. All of this is something that the engineer Qian Xuemei cannot match. But on the other hand, Xu Guoqing and others do not pay enough attention to science. For example, they dare to promise orders before the electron tubes have been successfully trial-produced, and they dare to say that they will learn to translate in three months without knowing foreign languages. Other factories dare not take on the orders for electromagnetic materials, but they dare. What are they based on? They only have one slogan: What others can do, I can do too... Can we say that there is no problem with the content in the above situation? Can we say that the characters' thoughts and behaviors have been somewhat rationalized? Although the author of "Blazing Red Heart" mainly writes about the soaring enthusiasm of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward, and uses action to prove that: where there is a will, there is a way; when the thinking is right, everything prospers. However, soaring enthusiasm still needs to be combined with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. The Party repeatedly tells us to be practical, work hard, and work cleverly. Clever work is to ask us to use our brains, find shortcuts, and learn scientific knowledge.

    I cite the above example only to say that it is possible to create a work that has no errors in content, but it is not so easy. The author should always ask himself how well he has learned Marxism-Leninism, how deeply he understands the Party's policies, and how much life experience he has accumulated.

    It is true that no one would object to the statement that good content alone, without being expressed through good artistic forms, is not a work of art. However, the principle that any artistic form is formed through corresponding expression techniques is often overlooked. When it comes to techniques, it seems that there is more or less a problem of technical viewpoints. The audience who watch dramas and new operas do not seem to be like the audience who like to watch Peking opera, who always comment on whether a certain person performs well and has the ability after watching a play. Today, critics who have watched dramas and operas generally only talk about: 1. How is the political content? 2. How is the atmosphere of life? They rarely talk about how the techniques are. Over time, this forms such a mentality for the people who make plays (writers, writers, performers): Good content and a sense of life are enough. They rarely discuss the skills of the actors. In order to ensure that there are no problems with the content, the writers try to take shortcuts and find ready-made themes as much as possible, preferably real people and real events. When writing lines, they would rather write more slogans, and do not give enough consideration to artistry and technique. During rehearsal, the director first considers how real it is, whether there are shadows of formalism, and whether there is an atmosphere of life. If these three points are achieved, even if it is invisible and inaudible, it will get a simple, honest, lively, and non-formalistic praise. In this way, playwrights, performers, and directors can ignore literary and artistic cultivation, not do basic training, and of course, they don't need any teachers. Judging from the programs at this festival, the vast majority of performing units have overcome the shortcomings mentioned above. In terms of playwriting, attention has been paid to the depiction of characters, and in terms of performance, many unforgettable images have been created. The audience is not only interested in the political themes and atmosphere of life in the plays, but also deeply benefited from the spiritual outlook of the people in the plays. Of course, some works also place the shaping of characters in an extremely unimportant position, believing that focusing on writing about characters is contrary to collectivism and promotes individual prominence. Therefore, they arrange a large group of people in the play. What one person can say clearly is often said by two people. It seems that the existence of the people in the play is only to explain the plot. They rarely have their own personalities and specific linguistic characteristics. Although they go in and out on the stage, talking and laughing, the audience often cannot tell whether the person on the stage is Zhang San or Wang Si after watching two acts.

    Stage art has also been greatly improved. The lighting, scenery, costumes, and props of plays such as "The Great River Flows East," "Song of the South China Sea," "Triumphant March," and "Huai Village" all contribute to highlighting the performance, rendering the atmosphere, explaining the occasion, and ensuring that the performance space and concrete space are appropriate and the style is unified. There are no luxurious scenery and bizarre costumes, nor are there very elaborate but unsuitable props. However, in these advantages, we can also see that some scenery is not concise enough, appearing piled up, and even complicated to the point that every grass and tree is available. It is worth noting that some song and dance programs that should not have scenery also have it. If this continues, not only will stage workers be too busy, but it will not enhance the artistic quality, it will only be "the scenery is used to make up for the lack of drama."

    We must pay attention to the content on the one hand, and we must also emphasize the techniques on the other hand. Without handy techniques, it is impossible to achieve the purpose of creating vivid artistic images. A work of art lacking artistry, no matter how politically progressive it is, has no power. But how can we have artistry? I am afraid that we must have techniques to guarantee it. The army's literary and artistic workers, while strengthening political study and striving to go deep into the reality of life, must also strengthen basic training in accordance with their respective fields and strengthen literary and artistic theoretical cultivation. While strengthening political thought and collectivist education, the leaders of cultural troupes and teams should also appropriately emphasize the formation of the unique artistic style of their own troupe and team, and the personal cultivation of writers, directors, and performers.

    Finally, I will talk about a few points of personal experience gained from observation and study.

    It is not comprehensive to regard literature and art as merely explaining policies and making on-the-spot propaganda; but it is a matter of course for literary and artistic workers to study the Party's policies and for the things reflected in their works not to violate the Party's policies. When necessary, it is not only necessary to act as an interpreter of the Party's policies through appropriate styles, but also to act as an on-the-spot propagandist. This is precisely the tradition of our army's literary and artistic work.

    For art forms and genres such as drama, new opera, song and dance, etc., it is a matter of course to pay attention to reflecting modern life and reflecting modern people. It is our glorious task to help the Party cultivate revolutionary new people, promote the formation of new characters, and educate the people to grow towards new morals. Therefore, it is correct to focus on depicting modern revolutionaries.

    Without good scripts with high ideological and artistic qualities, it is difficult to improve the performance quality of performing groups, and directors and actors cannot show their talents. Therefore, improving the quality of creation is still the most important thing in the future; but a performing unit does not necessarily only perform scripts created by its own unit, it can perform scripts from other groups, or even foreign masterpieces. In this way, techniques can be improved, and the audience can also get multi-faceted artistic appreciation and education.

    Our audience has always been particular about watching famous actors. The more famous actors a troupe has, the greater its appeal will be. Of course, we do not engage in the "star" system, but it is important to pay attention to the key training of talented actors.

    在全军文艺会演中看到的和想到的
　　陈其通
　　令人兴奋的收获
    中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演结束了，收获是很大的。单从戏剧方面说，有不少的节目称得起是思想健康，主题鲜明。在结构、语言方面也有一定成就。在表演、导演、舞台美术工作方面，达到了比较高的水平。就形式来说，确实是丰富多采。从创作思想来看，多数作品遵循着革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法。如舞剧“五朵红云”、“蝶恋花”主题的处理和情节的安排；“南海战歌”之木船渡海的雄伟气魄；“老梨树下”、“难忘的航行”、“怀念杨靖宇将军”；“火人的故事”等诗表演里所表现的衷情、激愤；“烈火红心”“槐树庄”等话剧里所表现的革命热情和细致的人物描绘；“巧绣河山”“塔里木战歌”等话剧里显示出向自然宣战的雄伟气魄；“年青的鹰”、“将军当兵”、“遥远的勐垅沙”等剧中那种浓郁的生活气息和新人物的个性成长的描写；还有像“挣断奴隶的锁链”、“五月的道路”、“彩虹万里”等剧中远景的想像；歌剧“红鹰”、“山清水秀”场面的新颖和继承传统戏曲的表现手法的成就；“东进序曲”、“凯歌行进”细致地描写了人物。从以上这些节目中我们可以看出部队文艺工作的进步。看会演中各种不同风格、不同内容的节目，有如走进百花园中看那些正在怒放的花朵一样地引人入胜。
    在很多的优秀剧目中描绘了有血有肉的现代人物形象，如“五朵红云”、“蝶恋花”舞剧中的男女主角；“南海战歌”中的丁军长、大老刘、冬梅；“东进序曲”中的陈主任；“烈火红心”中的许国清、杨明才；“将军当兵”中的几个战士形象；“巧绣河山”中的师长和司务长；“槐树庄”中的郭大娘；舞蹈“不朽的战士”中的黄继光等。这些新人物的形象是完整的，是能够起激发观众前进的作用的。在描写反面人物方面也有显著的成就，如“东进序曲”中的刘大麻子，“三八线上”剧中的美军上尉，“槐树庄”中的老地主等。
    由于许多节目的作者注意了描写人，导演把人的行动放在剧中首要地位，演员注意到表现人在戏中的独特个性，因此观众的感受是具体而又深刻的。编、导、演的同志们在创作的过程中明确地把描写现代的英雄，党的忠实的儿女们，作为创作的目标。这些戏描写他们在为祖国解放，为建设祖国的各个时期中表现出不屈不挠、夜以继日的战斗，在必要的时候毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命。平时他们对人谦虚，做事认真，不浮夸，居功不傲，临难不退。党和全国人民要求我们文艺工作者深刻地反映现实，创造出思想性艺术性都好的作品来教育人民，帮助人民新道德的成长。看过会演之后，觉得部队文艺工作者在这方面的工作是取得了一定成就的。有人说：会演中的大节目、好节目，多数是历史题材，能不能够把今天的题材写得同样的好？这种提示是好的，但我不同意把我党领导革命斗争时期的题材当成远不可望的历史题材。即是在会演中演演千百年来的中外史剧，只要是那些史剧对我们今天有教益、启示，也并不是不可以演。何况土地革命、抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝并非远史呢。有一位同志对我这样说：连看了几个戏，有如重温了一次中国革命史，看到昨天，想想今天，使我们想到党和毛主席的英明，感到革命人的崇高，唤起我们想一想在日常工作中是否有些对不起前人的事，是不是有自私浮夸，居功自傲，临难而退，或革命意志衰退的现象。这倒的确是值得我们深思的。
    其实，在会演的节目中不仅是出色地描绘了昨天那些不朽的革命人的行为，而且也十分动人地描写了全国解放以后的今天革命人的冲天干劲。像“将军当兵”、“年青的鹰”、“烈火红心”、“三八线上”、“无穷花”、“友谊”、“巧绣河山”、“翠玉岛”、“山清水秀”等剧，它们描写的革命人物在保卫国防，在向自然宣战，它们多方面地表现了不可战胜的中国人民的英雄气概。　　取得成绩的主要原因
    部队文艺工作者在党和军队首长的领导下，坚决地贯彻执行了党的文艺为工农兵服务和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。在去年整风反右之后，总政治部指示各文工团队短期下连当兵，或到工厂农村去深入生活，帮助业余文艺工作的开展，这对于这次会演，无论是专业的和业余的创作、演出，在思想性艺术性方面出现突飞猛进的成绩起着显著的作用。
    成绩取得的第二个原因是军队中各级党委和首长们对文艺工作的重视。就拿将军业余合唱团来说，这难道还是一件小事吗？谁听说过百多个身经百战头发斑白了的将军们唱合唱，而且是在炎热天练唱，一站一、二小时？这件事充分表明了他们重视部队文艺工作，珍视我们解放军的文艺工作传统。听将军业余合唱团演唱有很多人流下了眼泪，我也是其中的一个。
    将军业余合唱团所演唱的几首老歌为什么会引起观众经久不息的掌声呢？有人说是因为老人唱老歌，生活丰富，热情充沛，有如老革命家给青年人讲叙一生的革命经历一样。讲者越讲越兴奋，听者越听越想听。这的确是感人的主要原因之一，但我以为演唱的“三大纪律八项注意”、“太行山上”、“我是一个兵”这三首歌感人的重要因素是对主题作了最正确的处理。艺术造形上也是不错的。如唱“三大纪律八项注意”，使我们感到一支纪律严明的军队以雄伟的气魄，英雄的步伐在革命的里程上前进。“在太行山上”则把我们引到抗日战争的艰苦岁月里，人民为了拯救祖国，把儿子、丈夫送上前线。当演唱到“山高林又密，兵强马又壮”那种游击队的乐观情绪，气壮山河的英雄气概之时，听者不得不激动。当时好多老同志随之心和身动，真正做到演者与听者的思想感情，融合成一体了！此刻我们注意看一看台上台下的老战士们的面部，你会觉得他们仿佛正在向敌人冲杀，以大无畏的精神在赴汤蹈火。　　值得商榷的几个问题
    作品的内容是主要的。有人说整风反右之后，要求一个作品在内容上没有错误是容易的。理由是凡是此次来参加会演的作品政治上都没有问题。的确，会演里的所有节目，在内容上没有反社会主义、反人民、反党的问题，但在个别地方浮夸、与党的政策不尽吻合，也是有的。文学艺术是有属性的。愿意为无产阶级服务的文艺工作者在自己的作品里反映党的政策是很自然的现象，甚至既要反映长远的政治目的，又要反映现实党的政策以及人民的精神面貌。长远的政治目的与现实的政策是不可分割的。作者在寻找题材的时候，总是严肃地选择并安排最适当的情节和人物，特别是正面人物。当舞台上出现一个党的支书、政委的时候，观众往往把他们的一言一行都当成党的方针政策来领会，因此作者对自己创作的正面人物（特别是他们代表党说话做事的正面人物）就不能过早地放心地说没问题。哪怕有很小的一点问题，都会使作品的原意受到损害，都应当改掉。试举一例：如南京部队文工团刘川同志等创作的话剧“烈火红心”，是去年以来公认的好戏，它反映了去年大跃进中人民崇高的精神面貌——解放了思想，敢想，敢说，敢干；写出了我军的指战员无论是在部队上或在地方上，只要是为革命工作，只要党分配他们做什么，不管有多少困难，他们都会想尽一切办法，克服一切困难去完成。剧中几个突出的人物，如局长，厂长，副厂长，他们在特定的戏剧情景里显得那样百折不挠，诚实可亲。作品从头至尾以磅礴的气魄反映了中国人民为建设社会主义祖国的冲天干劲。我们肯定“烈火红心”是个好剧本。但我还不同意有人说修改过的“烈火红心”“政策思想上的缺点是基本上改过来了，某些人物的思想行为合理化了一些，但戏剧矛盾有些削弱，激情有些下沉……。”我先不谈是不是人物行为合理化了，戏剧矛盾和激情就下沉了的说法，只谈这次参加会演的“烈火红心”是不是就一点问题都没有？是不是人物行为都合理化了？参加会演本是修改了的，但很多同志看过之后仍认为某些基本缺点并没有改过来。复员军人许国清等书本知识不多、没有干过工业、从来还没有听说过什么叫电偶管的人，一干而电偶管造成了。钱学美和有技术的人干不成，这说明了许国清等人的政治热情高，有冲天的干劲，有恒心，白手起家建厂，勇敢地向困难进军，这都是工程师钱学美所不及的。但在另一面，许国清等人对科学有些不够重视，如电偶管还没有试制成功就敢于答应订货，不识外文就敢说三个月学会翻译，别的厂不敢承担电磁料的订货他敢，他们根据什么呢？他只有一句口号：人家能做的我也能做……。以上这种情况我们能说内容上一点问题没有吗？能说人物的思想行为合理化一些了吗？虽然“烈火红心”的作者主要是写中国人民在大跃进中的冲天干劲，用行动来证明了：人有恒心事竟成，思想对头万事兴。但是冲天干劲还需要和科学的实事求是精神相结合。党再三地告诉我们要实干、苦干、巧干，巧干就是要我们动脑筋，找窍门，学科学知识。
    我引以上例子，只不过是说创作一个作品要做到内容一点错误没有是可能的，但又不是那么容易的，作者应该随时多问问自己，对马克思列宁主义学习得如何，对党的政策是否了解得深透，有了多少生活积累。
    单有好的内容，没有通过好的艺术形式来表现，就不是艺术品，这话在字面上不会有人反对。但任何艺术形式，是通过相适应的表现技巧而形成的，这一道理往往被忽视。一提到技巧，似乎就多少有点技术观点的毛病，看话剧和新歌剧的观众，也不像喜看京剧的观众那样，每看一个戏之后总要评一评某某人演得真好，有本事！而今天看过话剧、歌剧的评论家们，一般地只谈：一、政治内容如何，二、生活气息如何，很少谈到技巧如何。久而久之，对我们搞戏的人（编、写、演）形成这样的心理：内容好，有生活气息就行了，很少谈论一下演员的技巧。写剧的人为了内容没有问题就设法走捷径，尽一切可能找现成的题材，最好是真人真事。写台词的时候宁愿多写一点口号，对于艺术性、技巧，则考虑不足。导演在排演期间首先考虑的是如何真实，是不是没有形式主义的影子，是不是有生活气息，若做到这三点，那怕是看不见，听不清，也会得到一个朴素，老实，有生活，没有形式主义的赞许。这样下去，编剧、表演、导演就可以不重视文艺修养，不作基本工训练，当然更不需要什么老师了。从这次会演的节目来看，绝大部分演出单位克服了以上所说的缺点，编剧方面注意了描写人物，表演方面塑造了很多使人难以忘记的形象。观众不仅是对戏的政治主题、生活气息感到兴趣，而且深深地从剧中人的精神面貌中得到教益。当然也有些作品把塑造人物放在极不重要的地位，认为集中写人物是与集体主义相违背的，是宣扬个人突出，于是他们在戏里安排了一大堆人，一个人可以说清楚的话，往往用两个人来说，似乎剧中人的存在只是为了说明情节，他们很少有自己的个性和特定的语言特征，虽然在台上出出进进，有说有笑，观众往往看了两幕戏还弄不清台上人是张三呢还是王四。
    舞台美术也有很大的提高，像“大江东去”、“南海战歌”、“凯歌行进”、“槐树庄”等剧的灯光、布景、服装、道具，都做到了烘托表演，渲染气氛，说明场合，表演空间和具体空间适当，风格统一，没有豪华的布景和光怪陆离的服饰，也没有很讲究而又不适用的道具。但我们在这些优点里也不难看出若干布景不够精练，显得堆砌，甚至烦琐到一草一木应有尽有。值得注意的是某些不应该搞布景的歌舞节目也搞了。这样下去不仅是舞台工作者忙不过来，对艺术性也不会有所加强，只不过是“戏不够景来凑”而已。
    我们一方面要注意内容，一方面也要强调一下技巧。没有得心应手的技巧，就达不到创造鲜明的艺术形象的目的。缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。但怎样才有艺术性呢？恐怕就得有技巧来作保证才行。部队文艺工作者在加强政治学习，努力深入生活实际的同时，还要按各行加强基本工训练，加强文艺理论修养。文工团、队的领导在加强政治思想，集体主义教育的同时，也适当地强调一下本团、队在艺术上独特风格的形成，编、导、演的个人修养。
    最后谈谈个人在观摩学习中所得的几点心得。
    把文学艺术看成仅是解释政策、作现场鼓动，是不全面的；但文艺工作者必须学习党的政策，作品里所反映的事情不违背党的政策是理所当然的。在必要的时候不仅要通过适当的样式，做党的政策的解说员，而且也应该作现场的鼓动员。我们部队文艺工作的传统正是这样。
    对话剧、新歌剧、歌舞等等艺术形式和剧种来说，重视反映现代生活，反映现代人是理所当然的。帮助党培养革命的新人，促进新人物的性格形成，教育人民向新道德方面成长是我们的光荣任务，因此以描写现代的革命人为主是正确的。
    没有思想性艺术性较高的好剧本，就很难提高演出团体的演出质量，导演、演员也无法显示自己的才能，因此今后提高创作的质量仍是最重要的；但作为一个演出单位不一定只演自己单位创作的剧本，可以演其他团体的，甚至是外国的名著。这样可借以提高技巧，观众也可以得到多方面的艺术欣赏和教育。
    我们的观众历来看戏都讲究看名角，那个剧团的名角多，它的号召力也就特别大，我们当然不搞“明星”制，但是，对有才能的演员作重点培养是应该注意的。
