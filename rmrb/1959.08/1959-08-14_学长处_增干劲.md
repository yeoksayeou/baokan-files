Learning from the Elders: Increasing Enthusiasm

Youthfulness and daring are the characteristics of most young people. Decades of labor and accumulated experience are the strengths of most older people. Both this characteristic and these strengths are very valuable. Individual jewels, no matter how good, cannot emit ten thousand rays of golden light. By concentrating and promoting the strengths of young people and older people, their enthusiasm can be more fully utilized. There is such an example in the Shiyang Commune: Yuan Tinglv, a planting expert and advisor to the Youth Production Team in the Lighthouse Management Area, taught his planting techniques to the young people without reservation. Twenty young people have now surpassed their master in planting skills.

The Party's ideological work is the work of cultivating people, and to do a good job of cultivating people, to mobilize all the positive factors of young people and older people to build socialism, we must be good at understanding and developing their characteristics and strengths. Just like a musician who organizes the best tones into beautiful movements, the Shiyang Commune Party Committee understands this principle very well and fully utilizes the enthusiasm of young and old farmers. Here, people are making progress every day, and production is constantly increasing.

　　学长处　增干劲
    朝气蓬勃，敢想敢干，这是一般青年人的特点。劳动数十载，经验从中来，这是一般老年人的长处。这个特点，这些长处，都很宝贵。单个的珠宝，不管怎样好，总不能发出万道金光。把青年人和老年人的长处集中起来，发扬光大，他们的积极性就能得到更充分的发挥。石羊社有这样一个例子：灯塔管区的青年生产队的顾问、栽秧能手袁廷绿，把他的栽秧技术毫无保留地教给青年人，有二十个青年人栽秧技术超过了师傅。
    党的思想工作，是作人的工作，而要做好人的工作，要调动青年和老年人的一切积极因素来建设社会主义，就必须善于了解和发挥他们的这些特点和长处。就像一个音乐家一样，把最好的音调组织起来，成为美妙的乐章，石羊公社党委很懂得这个道理，充分发挥了青年农民和老年农民的积极性。在这里，人们天天向上，生产不断高涨。
