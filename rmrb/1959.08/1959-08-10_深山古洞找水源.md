Finding Water Sources in Deep Mountain Caves

Because the sky constantly refused to rain, more than 300 mu of paddy fields in the Heshin Production Team of the Taoshu Management Area of the Steel Commune in Songzi County, Hubei Province, were almost half dry. The corn leaves were curled and withered, the sweet potato vines were also withered, and the water in the ponds had been pumped dry. Liu Dahua, the director of the management area, and Cai Tingshan, the branch secretary of the team, visited old farmers everywhere to find water sources.

On July 14th, they found an old cave in the first squad that had not produced water for several years. Liu Dahua and Cai Tingshan wanted to go into the cave to take a look, but the commune members stopped them, saying there were evil things in the cave. Some said that in 1953, a bowl-sized piece of scales and armor flowed out of the cave. The two of them were not afraid when they heard this. They said: Finding water is equivalent to finding food for everyone, and it's worth dying for. So the two of them, carrying a kerosene lamp and a large bamboo pole, groped into the cave. The squad leader and several commune members followed them in.

The cave was dark and cold. After climbing fifty or sixty steps, they reached the "pig trough pool" that the old man had mentioned. The pool had more than two feet of water, and the water was bone-chillingly cold. While feeling for the water, they suddenly discovered a viper as thick as a teacup in front of them. At this time, some people advocated turning back, saying that finding a little water was enough, and they were afraid there were more evil things inside. Comrade Liu Dahua didn't care at all. He took the bamboo pole from the commune member Yang Shunqing and drove away the viper, determined to continue groping inside. Commune member Yang Keshou said to everyone: Director Liu and Secretary Cai are not afraid to die climbing ahead, what are we afraid of climbing behind them? Everyone mustered their courage and continued to climb. After climbing another sixty steps, they finally found a deep water pool. Everyone was extremely happy. Truly, nothing is impossible for a willing mind.

That afternoon, Liu Dahua, Cai Tingshan, and the commune members started to use mud to build dams, dig ditches, and repair leaks to bring the water out. Four mu of fields that could not be saved were rescued. Later, the entire team found three more springs within two days. The first squad also opened up the old spring cave that had not produced water for twenty-eight years. In total, they can irrigate more than 30 mu of fields. (Yang Qingyuan)

    深山古洞找水源
    天老是不下雨，湖北松滋县钢铁公社桃树管理区合心生产队的三百多亩水田，眼看干了一半，苞谷干卷了叶，甘薯也干枯了藤，堰里水也车干了。管理区主任刘大华和队里分支书蔡廷善到处访问老农找水源。
    7月14日，在一小队找到了一个几年没出过水的老洞。刘大华和蔡廷善想进洞看看，社员们都拦住他们，说洞里有恶物，有的说1953年洞里流出了一碗大的鳞甲。他们两人听了并不怕。说：只要找到了水，就等于为大家找到了粮食，就是死了也值得。于是两人提着马灯，拿了一根大竹棍，就摸进洞去，小队长和几个社员也跟着进去了。
    洞里漆黑，又冷，爬了五、六十步，到了老人所说的猪槽潭，潭里有两尺多深的水，水冷得浸骨。正在摸水的时候，忽然发现前面来了一条茶杯粗的毒蛇。这时有人主张转去，说找到一点水算了，恐怕里面还有大恶物。刘大华同志毫不在乎，在社员杨顺清手里接过竹竿打跑了毒蛇，坚决要继续往里面摸。社员杨克寿对大家说：刘主任和蔡支书在前头爬不怕死，我们在后头爬还怕什么？大家又鼓着勇气跟着爬。又爬了六十多步远，终于找到了深水大潭。大家高兴得不得了，真是天下无难事，只怕有心人。
    当天下午，刘大华、蔡廷善和社员们就动手用泥巴作垱子、开沟、补漏，把水引出来了。四亩无水可救的田被救住了。后来全队在两天内，又找到三个水泉，一小队把二十八年不出水的老泉洞也开出了水，一共可灌溉三十多亩田。　（杨庆远）
