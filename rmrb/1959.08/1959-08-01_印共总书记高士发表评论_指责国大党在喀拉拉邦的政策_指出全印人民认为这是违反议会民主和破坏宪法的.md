Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 31st: The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly published an editorial written by Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India.

The editorial listed a series of failures by the Congress Party, which has formed an alliance with the dark forces of communal reactionaries, in inciting movements. The editorial pointed out that the Congress Party headquarters has not been able to isolate the Kerala government in the movement, but has "found itself isolated." The editorial described "how the vast majority of the people of Kerala refused to be drawn into a malicious struggle" and how the people of the whole country "condemned the Congress Party's policies in Kerala, considering them a violation of the principles of parliamentary democracy and a sabotage of the Indian Constitution."

The editorial said: "The movement to defend Kerala and oppose the Congress Party's tactics has developed into one of the largest movements in Indian history."

Ajoy Ghosh pointed out in the editorial that the failure of the anti-government agitation in Kerala "is precisely what the Congress Party leaders in Kerala and the Congress Party headquarters cannot tolerate. They know that the failure of their adventure in Kerala will have a profound impact on the whole country. When the Communist Party-led government was established in Kerala, a gap appeared in the Congress Party's monopoly on power, and if the new offensive against the Kerala government is defeated, this gap will widen further."

Ajoy Ghosh emphasized that, therefore, the Congress Party has formulated a new plan to "besiege" the Kerala government.

Ajoy Ghosh pointed out that the Kerala issue "is not an ordinary crisis. It involves a matter of life and death for the representative government system, a matter of life and death for everything that our national movement upholds, and a matter of life and death for the cause of democracy."

Ajoy Ghosh further pointed out that "our party has the confidence generated by the victories it has already won, recognizing that the cause we are fighting for is a cause cherished by the masses."

Ajoy Ghosh concluded by saying that we know that it is not the Congress Party headquarters or the central government that makes the decisions, but the people who are determined to defend democracy.

    印共总书记高士发表评论
    指责国大党在喀拉拉邦的政策
    指出全印人民认为这是违反议会民主和破坏宪法的
    新华社新德里31日电　最近一期的“新世纪”周报刊载了印度共产党总书记高士写的一篇社论。
    社论列举了同教族反动派的黑暗势力结成同盟的国大党在煽动运动中的一连串失败的事例。社论指出，国大党总部没有能够在运动中孤立喀拉拉邦政府，反而“发现自己陷于孤立了。”社论叙述了“喀拉拉邦绝大多数人民拒绝被拉入一场存心不良的斗争中去的情况”，以及全国人民怎样“谴责国大党在喀拉拉邦的政策，认为这是违反议会民主的原则和破坏印度宪法的”。
    社论说：“保卫喀拉拉邦和反对国大党的策略的运动已发展成为印度历来最大的运动之一。”
    高士在社论中指出，喀拉拉邦的反政府的煽动运动的失败，“正是喀拉拉邦国大党领导人以及国大党总部所不能容忍的。他们知道，他们在喀拉拉邦进行的冒险的失败，将对全国产生深远的影响。当喀拉拉邦成立共产党领导的政府时，国大党对政权的垄断地位就有了一个缺口，如果对喀拉拉邦政府的新的进攻遭到失败的话，这个缺口将更加扩大。”
    高士强调指出，因此，国大党就拟定了新的对喀拉拉邦政府的“围攻”计划。
    高士指出，喀拉拉邦问题“不是普通的危机。这牵涉到对代议制政府制度有生死关系的问题，对我们民族运动所拥护的一切东西有生死关系的问题，对民主事业有生死关系的问题。”
    高士进一步指出，“我们党具有已经赢得的胜利所产生的信心，认识到我们为之斗争的事业是群众所珍视的事业”。
    高士最后说，我们知道作出决定的不是国大党总部或者中央政府，而是决心保卫民主的人民。
