Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: On the 14th anniversary of the day when Japanese imperialism declared unconditional surrender in World War II, Japanese militarists, disregarding historical lessons, are openly preparing to use this day to carry out activities for a comeback.

According to "Japan News Weekly," the Japanese ruling class is currently launching a political movement to commemorate the "surrender day" under the guise of "commemorating" the war dead, in order to promote militarist ideology. They plan to hold a so-called "Conference to Commend and Commemorate Martyrs of the Greater East Asia War" at the "Former Soldiers' Hall" in Tokyo on August 15th, with Speaker of the House of Representatives RyoGoro Kato serving as the chairman of the sacrificial rites committee. The Japanese "Goyu Remmei," an organization of former Japanese soldiers, will openly preside over this conference.

The weekly pointed out that the initiators' letter for the "Commemoration Conference" contains the full text of the surrender "edict" issued by the Japanese Emperor on August 14, 1945, and emphasizes that Japan should now "strive for strength."

According to a report by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation on the 13th, the Nobusuke Kishi government's Ministry of Health and Welfare openly stated that it would collect and "console the spirits" of the remains of Japanese soldiers who were annihilated in China and the Soviet Union due to the aggression of Japanese militarists during the war.

"Japan News Weekly" stated that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party have long been encouraging the use of local government funds and donations from the general public to build memorial towers in various places to commemorate "fallen soldiers" and "kamikaze squads." The weekly pointed out that the Japanese ruling class is plotting to use this political movement to instill militarist ideology into young people. The weekly revealed that Hideo Honda, the director of the secretariat of the Japanese "Bereaved Families Association," one of the liaison groups for the "Commemoration Conference," told a reporter from "Japan News Weekly" that the mission of the "Bereaved Families Association" is to make the children of the fallen soldiers feel "proud" of what their fathers and brothers did, and to recognize the "superiority" of the Japanese nation and the "national mission" at this time, so as to unite them in a strong organization.

　　不顾历史教训　企图死灰复燃
　　日本反动派利用“八一五”宣传军国主义
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：在日本帝国主义在第二次世界大战宣告无条件投降的十四周年的今天，日本军国主义分子不顾历史教训，公然准备利用这个日子进行死灰复燃的活动。
    据“日本新闻周报”报道，日本统治阶级目前正在为纪念“投降日”而展开一个以“追悼”阵亡者为名的宣传军国主义思想的政治运动。他们预定在8月15日这一天，在东京的“旧军人会馆”举行所谓“表彰和追悼大东亚战争殉国者大会”，由众议院议长加滕镣五郎担任祭礼委员长。日本旧军人的团体日本“乡友联盟”将公开出面主持这个大会。
    这家周报指出，“追悼大会”的发起书中写有1945年8月14日日本天皇发布的投降“诏书”全文，并且强调日本现在应当“奋发图强”。
    据日本广播协会电台13日报道，岸信介政府厚生省公然表示要把战时由于日本军国主义者进行侵略而在中国和苏联领土上被歼灭的日本军人遗骨收验回去，进行“慰灵”。
    “日本新闻周报”说：岸信介政府和自由民主党老早就在鼓励用地方政府的经费和一般人士的捐款在各地建立悼念“阵亡士兵”和“敢死队”的纪念塔。周报指出，日本统治阶级阴谋通过这个政治运动把军国主义思想灌输到青少年中间去。周报揭露，作为“追悼大会”联络团体之一的日本“遗族会”事务局长本田英郎对“日本新闻周报”记者说，“遗族会”的使命是使阵亡者的子弟对他们自己的父兄所做的事情感到“自豪”，并且认识到日本民族的“优越性”和目前这个时候的“民族的使命”，从而把他们团结在一个坚强的组织里面。
