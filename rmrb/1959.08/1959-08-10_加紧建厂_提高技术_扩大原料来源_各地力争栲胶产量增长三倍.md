Speeding up Factory Construction, Improving Technology, Expanding Raw Material Sources
    Various Regions Strive to Triple Quebracho Extract Production

    (Our report) China's quebracho extract production is developing rapidly, with output increasing year by year in a straight line. The average annual output from 1950 to 1957 increased more than ninefold compared with the pre-liberation annual output. In 1958, driven by the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the increase was even greater. This year's planned output is more than three times that of last year. According to incomplete statistics, twenty-one modern quebracho extract factories have been built and put into production or are under construction in the first half of this year, and thirty-three are being prepared for construction. Many people's communes, forest farms, forestry grassroots units, commercial and light industry departments have also established small, indigenous quebracho extract factories.
    In developing quebracho extract production, various regions have implemented the policy of focusing on small-scale operations, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and building factories near raw material producing areas. With the support and assistance of the Yuecheng People's Commune and higher-level leadership departments, the Yuecheng Forest Chemical Joint Processing Plant in Defeng County, Guangdong, used moso bamboo and bamboo tubes instead of rubber tubes and copper faucets, and used water tanks instead of copper pots. After ten days of hard work by the employees, a quebracho extract workshop was built without using any steel, cement, or rubber tubes. This workshop was put into production in late April, and the product quality is very good.
    In order to improve the output and quality of quebracho extract production, many units have begun to strengthen production management and study ways to improve production technology. In order to gain experience in this area, the Fujian Forestry Department conducted experiments at the Nanping Xiqin Forest Chemical Plant and the Lianjiang Forest Farm, achieving preliminary results in increasing tannin content and mastering cooking temperature. In early July, the Yuecheng Forest Chemical Joint Processing Plant in Defeng County, Guangdong, expanded its original quebracho extract workshop and improved the stove structure, building a continuous furnace. Because of the full utilization of heat energy, the output has greatly increased while ensuring product quality. Some workers at the logging yards of the Sichuan Malkang Forest Industry Bureau have also achieved good results in improving production technology. For example, Li Wenbi, a female worker at the No. 208 quebracho extract factory, continuously extracted tree bark three times, and the extract yield increased by more than one time compared to the past.
    Various regions are also actively searching for new raw materials and opening up raw material sources from various aspects to meet production needs. After the Fuxin County Timber Company in Liaoning Province built a quebracho extract factory in late May, they faced a shortage of raw materials. They contacted units such as the Fuxin Mining Bureau Building Materials Factory and the Xinqiu Coal Mine Materials General Warehouse and obtained a large amount of larch bark raw materials with high tannin content, fully ensuring the needs of production. The Zhanjiang Prefectural Forest Product Comprehensive Processing Plant in Guangdong Province lacked mangrove bark, so they used tea oil seed shells as raw material. The tannin unit content of this tea oil seed shell is nearly 50%, and the purity reaches 59%. It is currently the peak season for the collection and purchase of quebracho extract raw materials. In order to strengthen the purchase of quebracho extract raw materials and ensure sufficient and timely supply, the commercial and light industry departments in Sichuan Province have also stipulated procurement and supply methods, adjusted purchase prices, implemented contract supply by region, and actively organized the transfer of raw materials for external調 under the principle of guaranteeing key points first externally and then internally.

### 加紧建厂　提高技术　扩大原料来源  各地力争栲胶产量增长三倍

    加紧建厂　提高技术　扩大原料来源
    各地力争栲胶产量增长三倍
    本报讯　我国栲胶生产正在迅速发展，产量逐年直线上升。1950年到1957年的平均年产量比解放前的年产量增长了九倍多。1958年在全国工农业大跃进的形势推动下，增长幅度更大。而今年的计划产量又比去年增长三倍多。据不完全统计，今年上半年已经建成投入生产和正在动工兴建的现代设备的栲胶厂有二十一个，正在准备兴建的有三十三个。许多人民公社、林场和林业基层单位、商业和轻工业部门还建立了小型土法生产的栲胶厂。
    在发展栲胶生产中，各地贯彻了小型为主、洋土结合、就近原料产地建厂的方针。广东德封县悦城林产化学联合加工厂在悦城人民公社和上级领导部门的支持协助下，利用毛竹、竹管代替胶管、铜龙头，利用水缸代替铜锅，经过职工们十天的辛勤劳动，没用一点钢材、水泥和胶管，就建成一个栲胶车间。这个车间已于4月下旬投入生产，产品质量很好。
    为了提高栲胶生产的产量和质量，目前许多单位已开始加强生产管理，研究提高生产技术。福建林业厅为了取得这方面的经验，曾先后在南平西芹林产化工厂和连江林场进行了试验，在提高单宁含量、掌握蒸煮温度方面获得了初步效果。广东德封县悦城林产化学联合加工厂7月初扩建原栲胶车间，并改进了炉灶结构，建成了一座连续炉。由于充分利用了热能，在保证产品质量的基础上，产量大大提高。四川马尔康森林工业局有些伐木场职工也在改进生产技术上取得较好成绩，如二零八场栲胶厂女工李文碧将树皮连续浸提三次，出胶率比过去提高一倍多。
    各地还积极寻找新原料，从多方面开辟原料来源，以满足生产的需要。辽宁省阜新县木材公司5月下旬建成了栲胶厂以后，原料来源不足，他们便同阜新矿务局建筑材料厂、新丘煤矿材料总库等单位取得联系，得到了大量含单宁很高的落叶松树皮原料，充分保证了生产的需要。广东省湛江专署林产综合加工厂红树皮缺乏，就用茶油子壳作原料。这种茶油子壳单宁单位含量将近50％，纯度达到了59％。目前正是栲胶原料采集收购旺季，为加强栲胶原料的收购工作，保证充分及时的供应，四川省商业和轻工业部门还规定了收购供应办法，调整了收购价格，实行划片包干供应，在先外后内保证重点的原则下，积极组织调运外调的原料。（附图片）
