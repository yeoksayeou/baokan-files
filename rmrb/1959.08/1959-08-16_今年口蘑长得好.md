Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 15th August: Inner Mongolia has a bumper mushroom harvest. On the Xilin Gol grassland of Huitengliang, which is rich in white mushrooms, more than 30,000 jin of mushrooms were collected in July, and it is estimated that about 100,000 jin can be collected in the next two months.

The Xilin Gol grassland is the largest mushroom producing area in China, with an annual output of about 600,000 jin. It produces white mushrooms, green-legged mushrooms, black mushrooms, etc., among which white mushrooms are of the best quality, with white flesh, delicious taste, and fragrant aroma. Because mushrooms must pass through Zhangjiakou when they are transported out, they are also called "kou mushrooms".

This year, there has been more rain in Inner Mongolia, which is extremely beneficial to the growth of mushrooms. Now, farmers, herdsmen, workers, and citizens in grassland cities such as Xilinhot, Abaga Banner, Zhenglan Banner, and West Ujimqin Banner, have organized collection teams to go to Huitengliang and other places to collect mushrooms. The autonomous region's commercial departments have established purchasing stations in the producing areas and have also established processing factories.

    今年口蘑长得好
    据新华社呼和浩特15日电　内蒙古蘑菇丰收。在盛产白蘑菇的锡林郭勒草原灰腾梁上，7月份就已经采集蘑菇三万多斤，预计在今后两个月内还可以采集十万斤左右。
    锡林郭勒草原是我国蘑菇最大产地，年产量约六十万斤。出产有白蘑、青腿蘑、黑蘑等，其中以白蘑质量最好，肉白味美，气味芳香。由于蘑菇外运时必经张家口，所以又叫“口蘑”。
    今年内蒙古雨水较多，对蘑菇生长极为有利。现在，草原城市锡林浩特、阿巴嘎旗、正蓝旗、西乌珠穆沁旗等地农民、牧民、职工和市民，纷纷组织采集队，前往灰腾梁等地采集蘑菇。自治区商业部门已在产区设立收购站，并且举办了加工厂。
