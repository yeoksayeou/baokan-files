We, the mighty army of hydroelectric construction, stand today at the 310 elevation! Standing on the perilous Sanmenxia! Standing on the Great Wall that intercepts the Yellow River! The Taihang Mountains on the right bend down, and the Qinling Mountains on the left bow in salute, to the heroes who conquered the Yellow River! To the Great Wall that holds back the flood! Looking westward to the white clouds on the horizon, the waters of the Yellow River burst out of the Kunlun Mountains! Mighty waves surge through thousands of valleys, and raging torrents rush towards our Sanmenxia. The hydroelectric army stands at 310! The hydroelectric army stands on the Great Wall! Ordering the flood to calm its waves, ordering the flood to restrain its vicious nature; oh, you evil waters that have roared for ages, oh, you raging torrents that have surged for ten thousand miles, for the first time you pass under our feet! Obediently flowing eastward through the man-made gate! The hydroelectric army stands at 310! The hydroelectric army sings aloud at 310! Last winter we cleaved the Yellow River, and built the treacherous natural barrier with a cofferdam, the waters of the Yellow River flowed backwards in our hands! The bottom of the Yellow River also revealed its original form! Fierce battles unfolded in the Dragon Palace, even in the freezing cold of the depths of winter, our vigor melted the ice and snow, clever plans removed the filth and mud; seizing the bedrock hidden for ten thousand years! Seizing the magnificent and beautiful treasures! The hydroelectric army stands at 310! The hydroelectric army sings aloud at 310! The Yellow River runs across the land of our motherland, separating the Taihang and Qinling Mountains, we will make the mountains that face each other, join hands and embrace each other, without the need for ferries to cross the river, without the need for bridges to span the river, building a city supported by gemstones! Building a city that emits electric light! I remember the time when the spring was warm and the flowers were blooming, the leap forward battle drums beat ever tighter; the seedlings downstream cried out: Quickly store the flood! I want peace! The chimneys around cried out: Quickly send electricity! For the benefit of the people! The tower cranes raised their arms high, the sparks of the electric welding flashed ever brighter, the vibrators wielded giant fists weighing thousands of pounds, the steel chorus sang with one voice: Speed ​​- run ahead of the flood! Quality - eternal and immortal! The hydroelectric army stands at 310! The hydroelectric army sings aloud at 310! Yu the Great controlled the flood and cleaved the Dragon Gate, but the real heroes are at Sanmenxia! We are not legendary figures, but the working class's hydroelectric army! We are not dredging the river channels, but controlling and utilizing the floodwaters; 310 - has qualified quality! 310 - is proof of speed! We stand at the 310 elevation, standing on the Great Wall that holds back the flood! We stand on Sanmenxia and sing aloud, marching towards even greater victories!

    三门峡上高歌
    吴烟痕我们水电建设大军，今天站在310高程！站在三门峡的天险上！站在横截黄河的长城！右边的太行弯下身躯，左边的秦岭低头致敬，向着征服黄河的英雄！向着拦蓄洪水的长城！极目西望天边的白云，黄河之水冲出了昆仑！雄涛怒卷过千万峡谷，狂浪飞涌而来我三门。水电大军站在310！水电大军站在长城！喝令洪水平息浪头，喝令洪水收起劣性；万古咆哮的恶水呵，万里奔腾的狂流呵，第一次从我们胯下穿过！从人造的门内乖乖东行！水电大军站在310！水电大军高歌310！去年冬天劈断黄河，戗堤飞筑天险神门，黄河的水在手中倒流！黄河的底也现出原形！龙宫里展开激战，哪怕十冬腊月的寒冷，干劲冲化了冰雪，巧计搬走了污秽泥层；夺取那深藏万年的岩磐！夺取的绚烂瑰丽的奇珍！水电大军站在310！水电大军高歌310！黄河横贯祖国大地，分隔了太行和秦岭，我们要使相望的山峰，手拉起手，拥抱相亲，不用那渡河的帆船，不用那跨河的桥梁，修一道宝石托起的城！修一道发射电光的城！记得春暖花开的时辰，跃进的战鼓越敲越紧；下游的禾苗呼叫：快蓄洪水！我要安宁！周围的烟囱呼叫：快送电流！造福人民！塔式起重机高举手臂，电焊的火花越闪越明，震捣器挥动千斤巨拳，钢铁的合唱一个声音：速度——跑在洪水前头！质量——千年不朽长存！水电大军站在310！水电大军高歌310！禹王治水劈开了龙门，真正的英雄却在三门！我们不是传说的人物，工人阶级的水电大军！我们不是把河道疏通，而是把洪水控制利用；310——有合格的质量！310——是速度的明证！我们站在310的高程，站在拦蓄洪水的长城！我们站在三门峡上高歌，向更大的胜利进军！
