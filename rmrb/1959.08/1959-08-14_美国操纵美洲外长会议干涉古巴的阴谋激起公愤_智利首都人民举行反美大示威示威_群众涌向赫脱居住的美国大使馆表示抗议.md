Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Santiago Dispatch: A mass anti-American demonstration erupted in the Chilean capital, the site of the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, on the evening of the 11th.

Approximately two thousand five hundred people, after participating in a rally that day in support of Cuba and Venezuela, immediately poured into the streets to hold a demonstration, protesting the United States' conspiracy of interference. The demonstrating masses proceeded along Merced Street towards the US Embassy, where US Secretary of State Herter was residing while attending the meeting.

The Chilean authorities deployed police and mounted police around the US Embassy, and mobilized motorized units. The police dispersed the marching ranks.

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 12th: A rally in support of Cuba and Venezuela was held in the Chilean capital on the evening of the 11th, on the eve of the opening of the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers.

The rally was presided over by representatives of the Chilean Workers' United Confederation, the Chilean People's Action Front, and the Chilean Christian Democratic Party, as well as a special Cuban delegation headed by Cuban Minister of Education Armando Hart. Argentine Communist leader Rodolfo Ghioldi, Venezuelan University Central Federation Chairman Héctor Pérez Marcano, representatives of resistance movements from Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay, and the mother of Cuban Armed Forces Commander Guevara all participated in the rally. Chilean Workers' United Confederation Chairman Braste, Venezuela's Pérez Marcano, and Cuba's Hart all spoke at the rally. Letters and telegrams from all over Chile supporting the rally were also read at the meeting.

The Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" published a commentary titled "The Americas Will Stop Aggression Against Cuba" regarding the rally, saying: "The development of the Cuban revolution is a tremendous attraction for the people of Latin American countries, and it has destroyed dynastic rulers like a storm. Many people participated in the rally supporting Cuba and Venezuela. One of the main characteristics of this rally is that it clearly opposes imperialism and any resolution at the foreign ministers' meeting that would legitimize the crimes of aggression against Cuba and Venezuela."

The commentary pointed out that this rally shows that "the Cuban revolution is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of Latin America, so they will not be indifferent to possible aggression." The commentary also said that the rally also exposed the conspiracy of the US State Department, which previously instigated the Guatemalan incident and is now using the puppet Trujillo to invade Cuba.

    美国操纵美洲外长会议干涉古巴的阴谋激起公愤
　　智利首都人民举行反美大示威示威
　　群众涌向赫脱居住的美国大使馆表示抗议
    新华社13日讯　圣地亚哥消息：在美洲外长会议会址所在地的智利首都，11日晚上爆发了群众性的反美示威游行。
    大约有两千五百人在参加那天举行的声援古巴和委内瑞拉的集会以后，随即涌向大街，举行示威游行，抗议美国的干涉阴谋。示威群众经过默尔塞德街向美国大使馆前进，这里是美国国务卿赫脱在参加会议期间居住的地方。
    智利当局在美国大使馆周围布满了警察和骑警，并且出动了摩托化部队，警察冲散了游行的队伍。
    新华社圣地亚哥12日电　智利首都在11日晚美洲外长会议开幕前夕举行了声援古巴和委内瑞拉的大会。
    这次大会是由智利工人统一工会、智利人民行动阵线和智利基督教民主党的代表以及以古巴教育部长阿曼多·阿特为首的古巴特别代表团主持的。阿根廷共产党领导人罗道夫·基奥迪，委内瑞拉大学中心联合会主席埃克托·佩雷兹·马卡诺，尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和巴拉圭抵抗运动的代表，古巴武装部队司令格瓦拉的母亲都参加了这次大会。智利工人统一工会主席布莱斯特、委内瑞拉的佩雷兹·马卡诺和古巴的阿特都在大会上讲了话。会上还宣读了智利全国各地支持这次大会的来信和来电。
    智利“世纪报”以“美洲将制止对古巴的侵略”为题，就这次大会发表评论说：“古巴革命的发展对拉丁美洲各国人民是一个巨大的吸引力，它暴风骤雨般地摧毁了王朝统治者。参加支援古巴和委内瑞拉大会的人数很多。这次大会的主要特点之一，是它鲜明地反对帝国主义，反对外长会议上将使侵略古巴和委内瑞拉的罪行合法化的任何决议。”
    评论指出，这次大会表明，“古巴革命在拉丁美洲人民中深入人心，因此他们不会对可能发生的侵略漠不关心”。评论还说，这次大会同时也揭露了美国国务院过去策动危地马拉事件，现在又利用特鲁希略这个傀儡来侵略古巴的阴谋。
