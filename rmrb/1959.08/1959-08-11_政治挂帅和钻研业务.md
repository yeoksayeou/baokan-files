　　Putting Politics in Command and Delving into Professional Work
　　Tan Shouling, Beijing Motorcycle Factory
    On the Party's birthday, I read the article "A Communist Party Member on the Commercial Front" in the People's Daily.
    I don't know Comrade Li Fenghua, a saleswoman at the Caishikou Non-staple Food Market, but after reading the article, I felt that Comrade Li was a good friend of mine whom I had known for a long time. The first thing I thought of was that I should learn from this Communist Party member's spirit of delving into professional work.
    Comrade Li Fenghua originally only had an elementary school education, but in just three years, she finally mastered the characteristics, specifications, performance, origin, storage, and consumption methods of more than 2,400 kinds of commodities. Think about it: she is very busy with her work and has very little spare time. Why could she achieve such results? I think her only characteristic is her ability to "delve" into her work.
    Her careful and painstaking study is for the sake of customers, the people, and the socialist construction of the motherland. This is precisely "putting politics in command." Therefore, we often say that putting politics in command is a starting point on the broad road to becoming "both red and expert."
    We often encounter people who delve deeply into their work for the sake of building socialism, and they are all examples for us to learn from.
    However, some people just can't delve into their own work. For example, some salespeople say, "We just stand at the counter all day and hand things to customers." Therefore, they have not delved into their work, and customers are of course dissatisfied. If one is not proficient in one's own work, one cannot better serve socialist construction and serve the people. From this point of view, not delving into professional work can neither achieve "expert" nor achieve true redness. "Putting politics in command" and "delving into professional work" are an inseparable unity. This is also the inspiration we get from Comrade Li Fenghua.

### 政治挂帅和钻研业务

　　政治挂帅和钻研业务
　　北京摩托车制造厂　谭寿玲
    党的生日那天，我在人民日报上读了“商业战线上的一个共产党员”这篇文章。
    我并不认识菜市口副食品商场的售货员李凤华同志，但是读过文章以后，却觉得李同志是我自己的一个早就相识的好朋友，我首先想到的，应该向这位共产党员学习钻研业务的精神。
    李凤华同志原来只具有初小的文化水平，但他在短短的三年之中，终于掌握了两千四百多种商品的特点、规格、性能、产地、保管及食用的方法。我们想想：他工作很忙，业余时间很少，为什么能得到这样的成绩？我认为他唯一的特点，就是对业务能“钻研”。
    他这样细心、苦心的钻研，是为了顾客，为了人民，为了祖国的社会主义的建设事业。这正是“政治挂帅”。所以我们常说政治挂帅是通往“又红又专”的康庄大道上的一个起点。
    为了建设社会主义而深钻业务的人，我们常常能遇到他们，他们都是我们学习的榜样。
    但是，有的人对自己本身的业务，就是钻不进去，比方：有的售货员就说：“我们就是成天站站柜台，给顾客拿拿东西”。所以他们没有钻到业务当中去，顾客当然觉得不满意。不精通本身业务，也就不能更好地为社会主义建设服务，为人民办事。这样看来，不钻研业务，不仅不能达到“专”，也不能达到真正的红。“政治挂帅”和“钻研业务”，是不可分割的统一体。这也正是我们从李凤华同志身上得到的启发。
