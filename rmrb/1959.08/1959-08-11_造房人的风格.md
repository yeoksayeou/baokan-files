　　The Style of the House Builders
　　Ni Ping

　　A few days ago, I stayed in Minhang Town, Shanghai County, for a few days and saw many huge factory buildings, some under construction, some completed, some with roaring machines, and some brightly lit. The heroic spirit of the great construction and great leap forward is vividly visible. Seeing the houses, I also thought of the style of the house builders.

　　You see one house after another, one high-rise building after another, all of which are the product of the labor of construction workers. Brick after brick, tile after tile..., once the construction workers labor, it can be turned into a majestic building, a pile of unremarkable materials, once through their hands, it can be turned into brightly colored things, like clouds in the sky. This is the style of combining concrete and simple labor with great goals. Every time I think of this, I feel that the labor of comrades in all walks of life and on all fronts is like building bricks and hanging tiles. How ordinary and how great it is.

　　Another reason why I have deep respect for construction workers is their selfless and self-sacrificing style. You see, they work at high altitudes and produce outdoors. They sweat like beads in summer and are exposed to the cold wind in winter, but they don't care about these at all. You see, they build camps and houses, giving people comfortable and stable conditions, but whenever they build this house, they leave this house. What they give people is a new house, and what they live in is a reed house. Some people talk about the lives of construction workers, often appearing in the posture of "sympathizers," as if it is just a "bitter" word, which is obviously wrong. We admit that all labor is arduous, but first, we admit that there is no unarduous thing to transform the world; second, we are not afraid of hardship, and we believe that all difficulties can be changed and overcome through various efforts; third, it is an incomparable pleasure to achieve achievements through hardships. Seeing the past fields become factories, and seeing their labor become huge and useful things, how can they not be happy?

　　My admiration for house builders did not start today, but my admiration for houses has not been long ago. Han Feizi's Five Vermin said: "In the ancient world, there were few people and many animals. People could not win against animals, insects, and snakes. A sage arose, built nests of wood to avoid the harm of groups, and the people were pleased, and made him the king of the world, and called him Youchao." It can be seen that from the very early ancient times, people have known how to build nests of wood. Although I still feel unfair about attributing the merit of building nests to Youchao alone in the history books (building nests must be done by everyone), I still respect Youchao, because he did a good thing after all. In the Spring and Autumn Period, there was a Luban, who was a skilled craftsman and greatly promoted the construction industry at that time. Water, wood, stone, and workers all took a step forward, and building houses and bridges gradually took shape, and finally formed the architectural art of our Chinese nation. Remembering our ancestors, we cannot but remember the achievements of our ancestors in building camps and houses. In modern times, the use of reinforced concrete has made the structure more complex, stronger, more gorgeous, and more comfortable to live in. All of this cannot but be grateful to the hard work of the house builders. It is for this reason that I have always had respect for the house builders.

　　造房人的风格
　　倪平
    日前，在上海县闵行镇逗留数日，看到许许多多偌大无比的厂房，有正在兴建的，有业已竣工的，有的机声隆隆，有的灯火辉煌，大建设大跃进的雄姿气概，历历在目。看到房子，也就想到造房人的风格。
    你看一幢幢的房子，一座座的高楼，它全都是建筑工人劳动的产物。一块块的砖头，一片片的挂瓦……，一经建筑工人的劳动，便可变成巍巍大厦，一堆堆其貌不扬的材料，一经他们的手，就可变成色泽艳丽的东西，好似天上的云霞。这是具体朴实的劳动和伟大目标相结合的风格。每每想到这里，我便觉得各行各业各条战线上同志们的劳动，都好比在砌砖和挂瓦，它是多么平凡，也是多么伟大。
    我对建筑工人深怀敬意的另一个原因，就是他们那种大公无私、先人后己的风格。你看，他们高空作业、露天生产，夏天挥汗如珠，冬天受寒风侵袭，可是，这些他们全都不在话下。你看，他们营房筑屋，给人以舒适和安定的条件，然而每当造好这幢房子时，也就离开了这幢房子，它给予人的是新房，而自己住的则是芦席房。有人谈到建筑工人生活，常常以“同情”者的姿态出现，仿佛就是一个“苦”字，这显然是不对的。我们承认一切劳动都是艰苦的，然而我们一是承认要改造世界没有不艰苦的事；二是不怕艰苦，认为一切艰难困苦可以经过种种努力而改变和克服的；三是经历艰难困苦而取得成就，那是一种无比的乐事。眼看过去的田野变成工厂林立，眼看自己付出的劳动变成庞大而有用之物，怎不欣然呢？
    我对造房人的钦佩，自不从今日始，但我对房子的景仰，却非久已由之。韩非子五蠹载：“上古之世，人民少而禽兽众，人民不胜禽兽虫蛇，有圣人作，构木为巢，以避群害，而民悦之，使王天下，号曰有巢氏。”可见，从很早的上古时代，人们已懂得构木为巢，尽管我对史书中把作巢之功归为有巢氏一人，尚感有欠公允（作巢势必是大家动手构作的），但仍对有巢氏怀有敬意，因为他毕竟办了件好事。到了春秋时代，出了个鲁班，是个能工巧匠，对当时建筑业有很大推动，水、木、石、工都前进了一步，作屋造桥，渐具规模，终于形成我中华民族的建筑艺术。缅怀祖先，不能不缅怀祖先营房造屋的劳绩。到了近代，钢筋混凝土的采用，构造越加复杂，倍加牢固，益臻华丽，居住更为舒适，所有这一切，都不能不感恩于造房人的辛勤劳动，正是这个缘故，我对造房人自始至终怀有敬意。
