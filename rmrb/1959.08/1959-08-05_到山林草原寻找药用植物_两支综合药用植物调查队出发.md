Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: Two comprehensive medicinal plant survey teams organized by the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, departed on the 3rd for Yunnan and Hainan Island to conduct medicinal plant surveys.

	Our country's tropical and subtropical regions of South China possess abundant plant resources, especially Yunnan and Hainan Island, which have many valuable and important medicinal plants. The comprehensive medicinal plant survey teams organized this time include researchers in relevant fields such as medicinal plants, phytochemistry, and analytical chemistry. Health and research departments in relevant regions will also send personnel to participate in the survey work. They will go deep into the mountains and grasslands and use phytochemical analysis methods to find some new and effective medicinal plants.

	The Institute of Materia Medica has conducted numerous drug surveys in various regions of the country, basically clarifying the varieties of traditional Chinese medicine and the drug use habits of various regions. Combining this with classical literature on traditional Chinese medicine, it is currently compiling a "Chinese Materia Medica." In order to better meet the needs of medicine with medicinal plants, this institute has sent researchers to key drug-producing areas such as Sichuan, Zhejiang, and the Northeast since this spring to conduct research on soil, fertilization, and other aspects related to medicinal plant cultivation, and to help local farmers summarize their experience in cultivating medicinal plants. In addition, personnel have been sent to southern Xinjiang to conduct a general survey of medicinal plants.

    到山林草原寻找药用植物
    两支综合药用植物调查队出发
    新华社4日讯　中国医学科学院药物研究所组织的两支综合药用植物调查队，在3日分赴云南和海南岛地区进行药用植物调查。
    我国华南热带、亚热带地区，蕴藏着十分丰富的植物资源，特别是云南和海南岛两地，有很多可贵的重要药用植物。这次所组织的综合药用植物调查队，包括药用植物、植物化学、分析化学等有关方面的研究人员，有关地区的卫生和研究部门也将派人参加调查工作。他们将深入山林草原，通过植物化学分析的办法，找出一些新的有效的药用植物。
    药物研究所曾对全国各地区进行过多次的药物调查，基本上摸清了中药的品种和各地区的用药习惯，并结合中药的古典文献，正在编写中药志。这个所为了使药用植物更好地满足医药方面的需要，今年春季以来已派研究人员深入到四川、浙江、东北等重点药物产区进行药物栽培中有关土壤、施肥等方面的研究，并且帮助当地药农总结栽培药用植物的经验。另外，并派人到新疆南部进行药用植物普查工作。
