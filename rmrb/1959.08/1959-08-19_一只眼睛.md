    One Eye...
　　Jin Ke

    Not long ago, a production team leader in Anyang County, Henan Province, called the commune Party committee secretary and said:
    “The water storage in ponds, rivers, canals, and wells is decreasing day by day. Seedlings are withering, the drought situation is critical, and the people are watching the sky with one eye and the cadres with the other…”
    These few words accurately reflect the mood of the average farmer in the early stages of the drought. Perhaps some comrades will blame the farmers for still "watching the sky with one eye"? Thinking that this is somewhat "backward," etc. Actually, there is no need to blame them like this. After all, we have not yet been able to fully control nature and fundamentally eliminate natural disasters. The Party teaches us that we must go all out, use our greatest efforts to overcome disasters, and strive for a good harvest, which is a battle call issued in response to our current situation.
    I think the other sentence, "watching the cadres with one eye," is very enlightening for us.
    According to the "force of habit" of the farmers, the quality of crops and the size of the harvest have always depended entirely on the heavens. Because under the conditions of a small-scale peasant economy, small farmers toiling and managing for a year cannot withstand the ravages of natural and man-made disasters. Under wind and rain, a year's hard work often turns into nothing. Therefore, farmers have the idea of "man proposes, God disposes," and when they have no other choice, they have to make helpless pleas to heaven. When there is too little rain, they pray to heaven; when there is too much rain, they pray to heaven; when locusts come, they also pray to heaven. But heaven is not always in accordance with people's wishes. However, nowadays, farmers have also seen that the world is different after all, so they have changed from watching the sky with both eyes to watching the cadres with one eye. Cadres have at least replaced half of the "heaven," and farmers have given the same trust to the cadres as they did to "heaven." This is a kind of awakening for the farmers, and it is also the glory we cadres have earned by striving to serve the people.
    So, shouldn't our cadres, who are sincerely "watched" by the farmers and who bear the heavy trust and expectations of the masses, conscientiously set an example and lead the masses forward? Just as we have seen in the past few years, no matter what movement it is, if the Party's leadership attitude is firm and the working methods are correct, the farmers will close one passive eye and wholeheartedly do the work they should do under the leadership of the Party; otherwise, they will hesitate, waver, and even retreat. The production team mentioned earlier also began to watch the cadres with one eye because the production team leader's leadership attitude was not firm enough and the work lacked methods. Later, the commune Party committee secretary personally went to the production team, went deep into the fields to investigate and study, launched a mass campaign to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and organized the fight against drought. Only then did the drought resistance struggle in this production team make rapid progress: all the members of the team, regardless of men, women, old, or young, completely watched the cadres with both eyes and concentrated all their energy on the drought resistance struggle; making the drought resistance movement truly reached a vigorous and down-to-earth level. Listen to the shouts of the farmers now: "The fields are dry but the heart is unwilling, we will ensure a good harvest without rain," "Resist to the end, we will not give up until we defeat the heavens." Doesn't this show that the eye that was considered "backward" has also turned around?
    To do everything possible and exhaust all means to strive for a good autumn harvest is the top priority on the agricultural front at present. In this struggle, the calm and firm leadership, the hard work of the cadres, leading the broad masses, and constantly developing the enthusiasm of the farmers, will gradually transform the farmers from "watching the cadres with one eye" to "watching the cadres with both eyes." Fully mobilizing with the idea of "man will conquer nature" is an important guarantee for achieving victory.

    一只眼睛……
　　金柯
    前不久，河南省安阳县有一位生产队长给公社党委书记打电话说：
    “塘、河、渠、井的存水量一天比一天少，禾苗枯萎，旱情危急，老百姓一只眼望着天，一只眼望着干部……”
    这几句话，把抗旱初期一般农民的心情，十分确切地反映出来了。也许有的同志会责怪农民为什么还要“一只眼望天”？认为这多少还有点“落后”，等等。其实是无需这样去责怪的。我们今天毕竟还没有做到完全能驾驭自然，从根本上消灭自然灾害。党教导我们必须鼓足干劲，用最大的努力战胜灾害，争取丰收，正是针对着我们的现状而发出的战斗号召。
    我倒是觉得那另一句话“一只眼望着干部”对我们有很大的启发。
    按农民的“习惯力量”来说，庄稼好坏，收成多少，那是自古以来全靠着天的。因为小农经济的条件下，小农们胼手胝足经营了一年，经不起天灾人祸的摧残。风吹雨打之下，一年辛苦往往化为乌有。所以农民有“谋事在人、成事在天”的思想，迫不得已时，便不得不向天作无可奈何的哀求。雨少了，求天；雨太多了，求天；蝗虫来了，也求天。天却并不是时时从人愿的。然而，如今，农民们也已经看到世道毕竟不同了，所以便由两眼望天，改为把一只眼来望干部了。干部至少已经代替一半的“天”，农民已经把同对“天”一样的信任交给干部了。这是农民的一种觉悟，同时也是我们干部奋力为人民服务挣来的光荣。
    那么，我们的被农民诚心诚意地“望着”的干部们，身负着群众的重托和期望的干部们，岂不正该兢兢业业地以身作则、带动群众前进吗？正像我们在过去几年所看到的，不管那个运动，党的领导态度坚决，工作方法对头，农民便会闭上一只消极的眼睛，一心一意地在党的领导下做好它应作的工作；反之，他们便会犹豫、动摇，甚至退缩。前面说的那个生产队，开始也是由于生产队长的领导态度不够坚决，工作上缺少办法，他们才把一只眼睛来看干部的；后来公社党委书记亲自到了这个生产队，亲自深入田间调查研究，开展大鸣大放集中群众智慧，组织抗旱斗争，这个生产队的抗旱斗争才有了飞速的进展：全队的社员，不管男女老少，便都把两只眼完全来看干部了，把自己的全部精力集中到抗旱斗争上来了；使抗旱运动真正达到了轰轰烈烈踏踏实实的程度。听听现在农民的喊声吧：“田干心不甘，无雨保丰收”，“旱到底抗到底，不胜老天不罢休”。岂不说明那只被人认为“落后”的眼睛，也已经转过来了吗？
    千方百计，想尽一切办法，争取秋季丰收，是目前农业战线上的头等大事。在这场斗争里，领导上的沉着和坚定，干部的艰苦奋斗，带动广大群众，不断地发扬农民的积极性，使农民从“一只眼望着干部”逐渐变成“两只眼望着干部”。用“人定胜天”的思想充分动员起来，这就是获得胜利的重要保证。
