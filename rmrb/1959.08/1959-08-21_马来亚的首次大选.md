    The first Lower House election since Malaya's independence has been revealed. According to the new Constitution of the Federation of Malaya, the legislative body of the Federation of Malaya is the Federal Parliament, jointly composed of the Supreme Head of State, the Upper House, and the Lower House. The 104 seats in this Lower House are for the first time entirely elected. The current Legislative Assembly was established in 1955, before the independence of the Federation of Malaya, with a total of ninety-eight seats, of which only fifty-two were elected. In this election, the number of registered voters totaled 2.17 million. A total of 258 candidates from various parties and independents participated in the election.
    In its pre-election manifesto, the ruling Alliance Party of Malaya (MCA-MIC Alliance) stated that if the Alliance continued to govern, it would adopt further policies to suppress the Malayan National Liberation Army. The manifesto also stated that if the Alliance continued to govern, it would abolish the "Emergency Regulations" "when the national security situation permits". The people of the Federation have strongly opposed these reactionary decrees aimed at suppressing the Malayan Communist Party and progressive forces. In terms of foreign policy, the party's election manifesto advocated opposition to "any form of colonialism" and declared that it would "establish good relations with all countries." While advocating that the Federation of Malaya should not participate in any political blocs, the manifesto also stated that the MCA-MIC Alliance was working to establish a "Southeast Asian economic and cultural alliance." The manifesto also slandered the Soviet Union and Hungary, and attacked China regarding the Chinese government's suppression of the local rebellion in Tibet.
    On the opposition side, the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party continued to campaign with religion and the protection of Malay privileges as its slogan. The party's chairman, Burhanuddin, recently stated that the party advocated a complete break from the influence of colonialism on Malayan politics, economy, and education.
    The Socialist Front of Malaya is the largest left-wing party in the Federation of Malaya. In its election platform, it expressed opposition to foreign troops stationed in Malaya. It proposed that Malaya should take the spirit of the Bandung Conference as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. The program emphasized a firm opposition to colonialism and advocated an independent economic policy.
    In order to make the election results favorable to the ruling party, the government of the Federation of Malaya adopted a number of measures to restrict the campaign activities of the opposition parties, and mobilized 20,000 police officers, ready to be dispatched to "maintain order during the campaign period and election day, and prevent accidents." Political departments and police authorities in various states often sent people to record the mass rallies held by the opposition parties, and threatened them.
    At the same time, the authorities of the Federation of Malaya have extensively arrested opposition party members. For several weeks, 112 people who were campaigning for opposition candidates have been arrested by the authorities, citing the "Prevention of Crime Ordinance." Among those arrested were Li Dianmo, a former member of the Central Committee of the MCA.

    马来亚的首次大选
    马来亚独立后的首次下议院选举已经揭晓。根据马来亚联合邦新宪法规定，马来亚联合邦的立法机关是由最高元首、上议院和下议院共同组成的联合邦国会。这届下议院的一百零四个席位，是首次全部由选举产生。目前的立法议会是在马来亚联合邦独立以前的1955年成立的，共有九十八个议席，其中只有五十二席由选举产生。这次选举中已登记的选民人数共有二百一十七万人。各党派和无党派人士共提出二百五十八名候选人参加选竞。
    执政党马华印联盟在选举前发表的竞选宣言中提出，如果联盟继续执政，它将采取进一步镇压马来亚民族解放军的政策。宣言还说，如果联盟继续执政，它将“在国家安全情况允许时”，废除“紧急法令”。联合邦人民一直强烈地反对这项目的在于镇压马来亚共产党和进步力量的反动法令。在外交政策方面，这个党的竞选宣言标榜反对“任何形式的殖民主义”，并且宣称要“同所有国家建立良好关系”。宣言一方面主张马来亚联合邦不参加任何政治集团，但是又表示马华印联盟正在致力建立一个“东南亚经济和文化联盟”。宣言同时对苏联和匈牙利进行诬蔑，并且就中国政府镇压西藏地方叛乱事件对中国进行了攻击。
    在反对党方面，泛马来亚伊斯兰党在竞选中继续以宗教和维护马来人特权为号召。这个党的主席布哈努丁最近又表示，这个党主张完全摆脱殖民主义对马来亚政治、经济和教育的影响。
    人民社会主义阵线是马来亚联合邦最大的左翼政党。它在竞选纲领中表示反对外国军队驻在马来亚。它提出马来亚应该以万隆会议的精神作为外交政策的基石。纲领强调坚决反对殖民主义的态度，主张实行独立自主的经济政策。
    为了使选举结果对执政党有利，马来亚联合邦政府采取了多项措施，限制反对党的竞选活动，并且动员了二万名警察，准备出动“维持竞选期和选举日的秩序，防止意外事件。”各州政治部和警察当局经常派人到反对党举行的群众大会进行录音，并且加以威胁。
    与此同时，马来亚联合邦当局大肆逮捕反对党人，几个星期以来已经有一百一十二个为反对党候选人进行竞选工作的人员被当局援引“防止犯罪法令”逮捕。被捕者中有前马华公会中央委员会委员李典谟等。
