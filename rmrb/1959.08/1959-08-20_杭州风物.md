    My hometown is more than fifty kilometers away from Hangzhou, and I didn't often visit Hangzhou before. The first time was in the late Qing Dynasty. When you arrive in Hangzhou, you must visit West Lake. I remember that I also went to Gongchen Bridge that time. It is about eighteen miles north of the city. As early as the twenty-first year of Guangxu (1895), Japanese imperialism, based on the so-called Treaty of Shimonoseki, opened it as a commercial port and designated a part of the land as a Japanese concession. When I came, I also saw Japanese shops and Japanese post offices. In addition, there were many casinos and brothels. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the concession was recovered, but before liberation, Gongchen Bridge was still under the rule of feudal bosses. The dockworkers were still subjected to exploitation and oppression, and there were still many casinos and brothels on the street. This situation was not completely changed until after liberation. Casinos and brothels disappeared. In the spring of 1958, a notice was issued, telling people to stop gambling. At that time, a few families who still had gambling tools hidden them also voluntarily checked them out and handed them over to the neighborhood committees and public security organs. After liberation, a new type of flax mill and other factories were built in the Gongchen Bridge area. The workers' dormitories of the flax mill are nearby, and the bell for starting work can be heard. No workers are late. It is also very convenient to study in spare time.
    When people hear about Hangzhou, they will definitely think of West Lake. West Lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides. The mountains are not high, and there are squirrels, wild rabbits, and badgers in the North Mountain. It is said that there are also muntjacs in the West Mountain. After greening, the mountains have changed their barren and dirty appearance, and they are full of greenery at a glance. West Lake had not been dredged for many years, the water was shallow, there were few fish, and there were many mosquitoes. If you go to the lakeside for a short rest on summer evenings, you must keep a fan in your hand to drive away the mosquitoes, otherwise you will be bitten with many big bumps in a short time. For several years, dredgers have been constantly dredging the mud, and the water depth has reached two meters in some places. The places where lotus flowers are planted are still relatively shallow. In addition, there are also planted water lilies (such as the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon) and water shield. Water shield is considered a famous Hangzhou dish, but it doesn't have much taste in itself, but it is very crisp. Because there are many fish in the lake, and because the people have been unremittingly eliminating the four pests, mosquitoes have not yet disappeared, but they are already very rare. Solitary Hill is also a famous scenic spot in West Lake. Orchids are cultivated there. The green cloud in the spring orchids, with one stem and two flowers, is a rare variety. I saw it blooming this year. Orchids are monocotyledonous plants with two layers of perianth, each with three petals. The most special thing is that the inner two petals on the left and right face forward, and the next petal is very different in shape and color. There is a kind of spring orchid called Butterfly, which is also a rare variety.
    The Liuhe Pagoda near the foot of the mountain and the Baochu Pagoda on the mountain have been newly built. Leifeng Pagoda is related to myths and stories. After the White Snake fell in love with Xu Xuan, she suffered many attacks from Buddhism and Taoism. First, there was a Wang Taoist transformed from a toad spirit who persecuted her. He first used a talisman to suppress her, and then gave Xu Xuan realgar, forcing her to drink realgar wine during the Dragon Boat Festival, forcing her to show her true form. Later, there was the monk Fahai who took her away while she was weak after giving birth and locked her in the tower. The people were extremely indignant about this. According to the old saying, when the White Snake's son, Xu Zhuangyuan, came to worship the tower (to worship his mother, the White Snake), the tower would collapse and the White Snake would be liberated. This is to obtain liberation by borrowing the power of imperial power (Zhuangyuan is called the emperor's disciple). However, some new dramas asked the Green Snake to invite reinforcements, defeat the guardian of the tower, and rescue the White Snake. As for Leifeng Pagoda, it collapsed as early as September 25, 1924. At that time, Lu Xun responded to the people's feelings and said: "It has collapsed, so how happy are the people all over the world!" It can be seen that the people have always been indignant about Fahai's persecution of the White Snake. The pagoda now only has ruins and has not been restored.
    Speaking of West Lake, we cannot fail to mention "Viewing Fish at Flower Pond." It has been expanded from about four acres of land to two hundred acres. There are pavilions, flowers and trees inside. About fifty acres of land are covered with turf, like a green carpet. On Sundays, children sit around and sing, or play or roll on the turf. Along a section of the park's road, there are many loquat trees planted. When the loquats are ripe in spring, no tourists pick them when they pass by. It can be seen that everyone's "public morality" has been greatly improved, and they no longer take public property.
    Secondly, we must mention the botanical garden in the Yuquan Renshou Mountain area. There are ornamental plants inside, such as magnolias, azaleas, and peach blossoms. In addition, there are plants from other provinces, such as the ancient plant metasequoia from the west, subtropical fruit trees from South China, longan, lychee, and Yunnan camellia, etc., which have adapted to the climate and are living well. The woody plants in the botanical garden are cultivated according to the classification method of taxonomy. It is a research institution, but it also carries out variety cultivation to serve the purpose of greening the city and afforestation of barren mountains.
    Hangzhou has now been expanded. Near Fuyang in the suburbs, there are thousands of acres of land that have been designated by the health department as a place for planting Chinese medicinal materials. Hundreds of kinds of medicinal herbs have been planted. Some Chinese medicines are indeed very effective. They have all been derived from thousands of years (or far more) of experience, and it is not surprising. Chinese medicine practitioners often suggest that after liberation, the wasteland has been gradually utilized, and the field ridges separating the fields have been reduced, so the places where wild medicinal plants grow have been reduced, and the use of Chinese medicine has increased, so artificial cultivation of medicinal plants has become necessary. However, at present, the amount of cultivation is still far from enough.
    The place where medicinal plants are cultivated also raises medicinal animals. For example, Qishe is an important medicine in Chinese medicine, and Jiashe turtle, also written as Keshe turtle, its shell is dried and ground into powder, which is used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis and other diseases. These animals have also been raised.
    Also, there were many villas of bureaucrats, landlords, warlords, and wealthy businessmen next to the West Lake in old Hangzhou. After liberation, these buildings have been converted to other uses. For example, the First and Second Sanatoriums of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions were converted from the villas of former bureaucrats and capitalists. Workers often come in and out of them, or sit by the lake and enjoy the scenery.
    Objectively speaking, there are many areas with mountains and rivers like West Lake in the southern provinces. Its fame is probably related to the poems sung by poets throughout history. The climate is also not very good: it often rains a lot in spring, and it often does not rain for a long time in summer, and the weather is also very hot. But after working hard in the industrial area, taking a short rest at West Lake, looking at the fish in the park, and eating some lotus root flour (because it is common to see tourists eating lotus root flour in the rest room, so it is said) also has the effect of restoring physical strength and energy.

　　杭州风物
　　周建人
    我的家乡离杭州有五十多公里，以前并不常到杭州。第一次在前清末年曾到过。到了杭州必然到西湖游览。记得那一次还到过拱宸桥。它在城北约十八里之处。早在光绪二十一年间，日本帝国主义根据所谓马关条约，辟为商埠，划了一部分之地为日租界。我来的时候，还看到日本商店和日本邮局。此外，有很多赌场及妓院。抗日战争胜利后，租界是收回了，但在解放前，拱宸桥仍在封建把头统治之下，搬运工人仍受剥削与压迫，街上还有不少赌场和妓院。这种状况直到解放以后才彻底改变。赌场、妓院不见了。1958年春天出过一个布告，叫人们别再赌博。当时少数还藏有赌具的人家也自动地把它检出交给居民委员会及公安机关了。解放后，拱宸桥一带建设了新型的麻纺厂和别的工厂。麻纺厂的工人宿舍都在近旁，上工的铃声听得到。没有工人迟到的。工余学习也很方便。
    人们听到杭州，必定联想到西湖。西湖三面有山环绕。山不高，北山有松鼠、野兔及獾。闻说西山还有麂。绿化后，山改变了荒芜污脏的面貌，一望满目青彩。西湖本来多年不疏浚，水浅，鱼少，蚊子多。夏季晚上如往湖滨少憩，必须扇子不离手的赶蚊子，否则少时即被咬起不少大疙瘩。数年来，有挖泥船经常在挖泥，水深之处已达二米。栽荷花之处则仍比较浅。此外，还种有睡莲（如三潭印月）及莼菜，莼菜算是一种杭州的名菜，其实本身并没有什么味道，不过很清脆罢了。因湖水中鱼已多，并且由于人民群众不懈地除四害，蚊子虽尚未绝迹，但已很稀少了。孤山也是西湖里一个名胜。那儿培养兰蕙。春兰中的绿云，一干两花，是难得的品种，今年看到它开着花。兰蕙是单子叶植物，有内外二层花被，各三瓣。最特别的是内层左右二瓣向前，下一瓣形色大异。有种春兰叫蝴蝶的，也是少见的名种。
    近山脚的六和塔和山上的宝俶塔是新修的。雷峰塔则与神话故事有关。白蛇与许宣恋爱后，历受佛道的打击。先有虾蟆精变成的王道士迫害她。先用符去镇她，后赠给许宣雄黄，端午迫她饮雄黄酒，迫她现原形。后有法海和尚，乘她产后衰弱，把她捉去，关在塔里。人民对此极为不平。旧说白蛇的儿子许状元来祭塔时（祭他的母亲白蛇），塔便倒掉，白蛇得到解放。这是借君权（状元称天子门生）的力量获得解放的。但有的新剧则为青蛇请得援军，打败塔的守神，救出了白蛇。至于雷峰塔，早在1924年9月25日倒掉了。当时鲁迅曾反应人民的感情说：“它居然倒掉了，则普天之下的人民，其欣喜为何如？”可见自来人民对于法海迫害白蛇的不平。塔今只剩有遗址，没有修复。
    讲到西湖，不能不讲到“花港观鱼”。它已由四亩左右之地扩大到二百亩。内有园亭，花木。约有五十多亩土地铺上草皮，像绿色的地毯，星期天有小孩们在围坐唱歌，或在草皮上游玩或打滚。有一段园林的路旁，栽枇杷树很多。春季枇杷黄熟时，游人经过，没有人去采摘的。可见大家“公德心”已大大提高，不拿公物了。
    其次不能不讲到的，是玉泉仁寿山一带的植物园。里面有观赏植物；如木兰、杜鹃、碧桃之类。此外有来自外省的植物，如西部的古植物水杉，华南的亚热带果树，桂圆，荔枝，及云南茶花等等，都已和气候适应，良好地生活着。植物园里的木本植物是按照分类学的分类法栽培的。它是一个调查研究的机构，但亦进行培育品种，为绿化城市及荒山造林的目的服务。
    杭州现在已经扩大了，郊外近富阳之处，有地数千亩，已由卫生部门把它作为栽种中药之处。栽药已有几百种。有些中药确实非常灵验。都由几千年（或远不止此数）的经验得来，本也没有什么奇怪。中医师常常提议；解放后，荒废之地逐步利用起来了，田与田之间分隔的田塍也少了，生野生药用植物之处因此减少，中药的用度却增大，人工栽种药用植物遂成为必要。不过在目前，栽培的量还很不够。
    那培养药用植物的地方，也饲养了药用的动物。如蕲蛇，是中药里重要的药物，呷蛇龟，也写作剋蛇龟，它的甲培枯研末，用以治肺结核等病。这等动物也已饲养起来了。
    又，旧杭州的西湖旁边有不少官僚、地主、军阀、富商的别墅。解放后，这些建筑已改作别种用途了。例如上海总工会的第一、第二休养所就是以前官僚资产阶级的别墅改用的。常有工人出入其间，或坐在湖边看风景。
    平心而论，像西湖的有山有水之区，南方不少省份都可以找到。它的出名大概同历来诗人的歌咏有关系。气候也不很佳：春季常多雨，夏季常常日久不雨，天气也很炎热的。但在工业区紧张地劳动之后，到西湖作短期休息。看看公园里的游鱼，和吃点藕粉（因常见游人在休息室内吃藕粉，故云），也是有恢复体力与精神作用的吧。
