　　Emphasize Intermediate Testing
　　Jin Wen
　　The outcome of a scientific research project must undergo numerous trials beforehand. However, after the experiment succeeds, in order to widely apply this scientific research result to production, it often needs to go through another kind of test, which is called intermediate testing by scientists.

　　Because the small laboratory for scientific research and the large workshop in the factory, the small experimental paddy field and the large-scale paddy field have greatly different conditions. Some scientific research is completely successful in the laboratory. However, when it is applied to the production sector, problems are sometimes found, and it may even completely fail to meet the needs of the production site. For example, in laboratory research, it can be done in terms of equipment because the amount used is small, but large-scale production will encounter difficulties. For example, some equipment must be adapted to local conditions and use local materials in large-scale production, but these problems are often rarely considered in the laboratory. For example, in small-scale, high-yield experimental fields, various expensive chemical fertilizers can be used, but it is difficult to have so much fertilizer when it is promoted in large fields, and cost accounting cannot be ignored. Problems like these can only be discovered and resolved through intermediate testing, so that scientific research results can be truly promoted and applied.

　　Therefore, intermediate testing is related to both the scientific research department and the production department. The cooperation of both parties can make it faster and better. There are examples of scientific research departments actively conducting intermediate testing and taking the initiative to find production departments, which are welcomed by the production departments, and the research results quickly play a role in production. There are also examples of production departments finding scientific research departments, actively providing conditions, and conducting intermediate tests together, so that research results can be quickly promoted and applied, and new research topics can also be proposed, enriching the content of scientific research.

　　The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Agricultural Science Research Institute has well solved the problem of intermediate testing by adopting two teams, one working in the commune and the other working in the research institute. They combine the research of the research institute with the experiments on the production site, thus timely promoting production. In summer, autumn, and in this year's harvest, there are their contributions.

　　Scientific research departments and production departments, let us all pay attention to the intermediate testing of scientific research results, create more and better experiences, and make scientific research results more and better promoted and applied.

　　重视中间性试验
　　金文
    一项科学研究的成果，事先要经过很多次的试验。可是试验成功之后，要将这种科学研究成果广泛运用到生产中去，往往还须经过另外一种试验，用科学工作者的话来说，这就叫做中间性试验。
    因为，进行科学研究的小实验室与工厂里的大车间，小块试验地的水稻与大面积的水稻田，彼此间的条件有很大的区别。有些科学研究在实验室的时候，已经完全成功。但是一到生产部门应用的时候，有时还会发现问题，甚至完全不合乎生产现场的需要。比如，在实验室研究的时候，在器材设备方面，因为用量少，可以办到，大范围的生产就会发生困难。又如某些器材设备，在大范围的生产中要因地制宜，就地取材，在实验室却往往很少能考虑到这些问题。又如在小面积的高产试验田中，可以使用价钱很贵的各种化学肥料，但在大田推广的时候就很难有这样多的化肥，而且也不能不进行成本计算。诸如此类的问题，只有通过中间性试验，才能发现并加以解决，才能将科学研究成果真正地推广应用。
    所以，中间性的试验，关系到科学研究部门，也关系到生产部门，两方面通力协作，就可以办得快而且办得好。有这样的例子，科学研究部门积极进行中间性的试验，主动找到生产部门去，受到生产部门欢迎，研究成果在生产上很快发挥了作用。也有这样的例子，生产部门找到科学研究部门去，积极提供条件，一起进行中间性试验，使研究成果也很快就能推广应用，同时还提出一些新的研究课题，丰富了科学研究的内容。
    广西僮族自治区农业科学研究所，采取两套人马一套在公社和一套在研究所工作的办法，就很好地解决了中间性试验的问题。他们把研究所的研究与生产现场的试验结合起来，因而及时地推动了生产，在夏季，在秋季，在今年的丰收果实里，就有着他们的贡献。
    科学研究部门，生产部门，大家都来重视科学研究成果的中间性试验，创造更多更好的经验，使科学研究成果更多更好地推广应用。
