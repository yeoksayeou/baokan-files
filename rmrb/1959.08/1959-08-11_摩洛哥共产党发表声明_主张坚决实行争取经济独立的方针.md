　　Moroccan Communist Party Issues Statement
　　Advocating Resolute Implementation of Economic Independence Policy
    Rabat Dispatch: The Moroccan weekly "Al-Jamahir" published on the 6th the statement of the Political Bureau of the Moroccan Communist Party on July 30. The statement emphasizes that the main problem to be solved by Morocco in the current situation is to consolidate the measures that have been taken and resolutely implement the policy of striving for economic independence.
    The statement points out that a large-scale propaganda campaign launched with the support of French imperialism is developing, with the theme that the Moroccan franc must be devalued and controls on capital transfers must be lifted. The statement said that the devaluation of the Moroccan franc would deepen the colonial nature of the Moroccan economy, and its main victims would be the masses of the people.
    The statement went on to say that in order to avoid the devaluation of the Moroccan franc, the following measures should be taken: control and allocation of loans to increase investment, expand production, develop industry, redistribute land, establish construction projects that employ large numbers of laborers, carry out tax reforms on the basis of taxing huge incomes and profits, establish a strict system for supervising foreign trade, develop trade with socialist countries, and establish close economic cooperation with these countries. The statement finally called on all Moroccan political parties and national movement organizations to unite to eliminate the serious dangers facing Moroccan independence.

　　摩洛哥共产党发表声明
　　主张坚决实行争取经济独立的方针
    拉巴特消息：6日出版的摩洛哥“群众”周刊发表了摩洛哥共产党政治局7月30日的声明。声明强调指出，摩洛哥在目前情况下要解决的主要问题，是巩固已经采取的措施，坚决实行争取经济独立的方针。
    声明指出，在法帝国主义支持下发动的一个大规模宣传运动正在发展中，宣传主题是什么摩洛哥法郎必须贬值、必须取消对资金转移的控制。声明说，摩洛哥法郎贬值将加深摩洛哥经济的殖民地性质，其主要的受害者将是人民群众。
    声明接着说，为了避免摩洛哥法郎贬值，应该采取下列办法：控制和拨出贷款以增加投资、扩大生产，发展工业，重新分配土地，兴办雇用大量劳动力的建设工程，在对巨额收入和利润征税的基础上进行税收改革，建立严密监督对外贸易的制度、发展同社会主义国家的贸易，并且同这些国家建立密切的经济合作关系。声明最后号召摩洛哥一切政党和民族运动组织团结起来，以消除摩洛哥独立所面临的严重危险。
