　　Intensify Practice and Show Your Skills
    Just as the industry, agriculture, and commerce sectors are sounding the charge for the Great Leap Forward, good news has also come from the sports front: athletes from all over are eager to practice harder, ready to make greater contributions to the upcoming first National Games, which is very encouraging.
    In the past few short years, with the full support of the Party and the people, China's sports have made considerable achievements. Some of these projects have reached the international level or have set world records. However, our sports projects are still very backward in many respects, and some of the better performing projects still need to be consolidated and improved. Therefore, this requires athletes and coaches to muster their energy, strive for the top, and rapidly improve their performance. Of course, people should not go beyond objective conditions to fantasize and force themselves to do things that cannot be done for the time being. However, it is also wrong not to work hard to achieve things that can be achieved after effort. In the past few years, one of the main experiences of the sports projects in which we have achieved outstanding results is that athletes have great ambitions and have made arduous efforts, coupled with the mutual assistance and mutual learning between coaches, instructors and athletes, the result is very effective. We have already seen this scene in this set of photos. We hope that this new style of sportsmanship can continue to be promoted, so that China's sports will advance with the times.

　　加紧练习　大显身手
    正当工农商各业吹起跃进的号角的时候，体育战线上也传来了好消息：各地运动员都磨拳擦掌，加紧练习，要在即将召开的全国首届运动会上作出更大的贡献，这是十分令人鼓舞的事。
    在过去短短的几年中，我国体育运动在党和人民的全力支持下，取得了可观的成就。其中有些项目业已达到了国际水平，或者创造了世界纪录。但是，我们的运动项目在不少方面还很落后，一些成绩较好的项目也还有待于继续巩固和提高。因此，这就要求运动员和教练们鼓足干劲、力争上游，迅速提高成绩。当然，人们不应当超越客观条件去胡思乱想，勉强去做那些暂时做不到的事。但是，在经过努力以后能做到的事而不去努力达到，这也是不对的。在过去几年中，凡是我们能取得突出成绩的运动项目，其中一条主要经验是运动员有宏图大志，并作了艰苦努力，再加上教练、指导和运动员的互相帮助，互切互磋，结果，收效很大。我们从这一组照片中，已经看到了这种景象。我们希望这种新的体育风尚，能继续发扬光大，使得我国体育运动与时俱进。
