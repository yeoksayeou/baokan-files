Former Locust Nest, Today's Bountiful Area
A Sideline on Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, Changing the Locust Area Environment and Eradicating Locust Plague
By our reporter Jiang Weicai
　　I heard that Suqian's locust control work was outstanding, and many visitors praised it, so I made a special trip to visit.

　　Indeed, it lives up to its reputation. The face of the locust area here has undergone fundamental changes. Who would have thought that this historically famous key locust area in Jiangsu Province has seen a 90.2% reduction in the area affected by locusts this year compared to the same period last year. Why has such a huge change occurred in just one year? The most important reason is that after the large-scale elimination of summer locusts, communization was realized here. The People's Commune brought unprecedented superior conditions for eradicating locust plagues.

　　Heroes Deploy Arrays to Fight Locusts in Lakes and Swamps
　　Suqian County has no less than 500,000 mu of lake and swamp areas and 420,000 mu of flat upland areas. These places are sparsely populated, and the land is vast, with most of it yielding only one harvest a year, thus becoming a "free world" for locusts to hatch and lay eggs. The area affected by locusts reaches about 600,000 mu every year. Therefore, the people of Suqian regard defeating locust plagues as the main task to ensure a good harvest, and they wage fierce battles against locust plagues every year.

　　Last year was the year with the most locusts since liberation. The total area affected by summer and autumn locusts in the county reached 1.08 million mu (including 620,000 mu of summer locusts and 460,000 mu of autumn locusts), covering fifteen townships. The people's struggle against the locusts was fierce. When summer locusts occurred, the entire county immediately dispatched more than 50,000 people, divided into dozens of routes, to deploy arrays in the lakes, swamps, river beaches, and farmland to open fire on the locusts. More than 1,000 scouts haunted every locust area to investigate the locust situation, not allowing a single locust to hide.

　　12,000 locust control heroes fighting in the old nest of locusts—the heart of Luoma Lake—formed long snake arrays to encircle and suppress the locusts from all directions. In order to quickly eliminate the locust plague, they set up camps on the spot, cooked meals, ate in the阵地 [zhèn dì - position; front], slept in the阵地, fought in the阵地, and never left the阵地. They loudly put forward the battle slogan of "Fighting locusts is like fighting tigers, we will not give up until the locusts are wiped out," and adopted the method of fighting fiercely in sunny days, fighting hard in light rain, and fighting even in heavy rain, not letting go of a single locust, and not allowing a single locust to escape. A 2,000-strong Young Pioneers team from the Democratic Brigade of Xiaodian Commune, after half a month of fighting, captured and killed more than 120,000 locusts. These little heroes are clever and skillful, and they are better at fighting locusts than older people.

　　The 50,000-strong locust control army, with their indomitable will and heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, after 45 days of hard work, completely wiped out this fierce locust plague, with artificial capture alone reaching more than 56,800 catties of locusts. It is precisely with this fighting spirit that the people of the county, under the leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, have overcome locust plagues year after year and time after time, ensuring bumper harvests of grain, oil crops, and other crops every year.

　　Destroying Old Nests, Killing Two Birds with One Stone
　　Fighting locusts every year, having locusts every year, it has been like this for thousands of years. However, this situation is being changed by the people. The heroic people of Suqian, after years of exploration, have finally found a way to eradicate locust plagues, and that experience is: closely integrating with production, changing the locust area environment through water storage and fish farming, changing dry land to paddy fields, afforestation, intensive cultivation, and large-scale eradication of locust plagues.

　　As early as last spring, the Suqian County Party Committee, in order to increase grain yield per unit area and improve people's living standards, decided to convert the largest area, Luoma Lake (400,000 mu), into a perennial reservoir, and to replant rice on a large scale throughout the county, gradually realizing: planting rice in the Pinghu area, storing water in the lakes and depressions to raise fish and shrimp, planting fruit trees on the Yellow River滩 [tān - shoal; sandbar], planting grapes on Ma陵[líng - tumulus; mausoleum] Mountain, intensive cultivation of farmland, and greening all road embankments and river dikes. When the environment of the locust area is changed, the locusts will be completely eliminated.

　　After the wheat harvest last year, Luoma Lake, the old nest of locusts that caused the most harm, was rebuilt into a reservoir. In the past, this lake was basically a dry lake, with water in June and July every year, growing one crop of wheat a year, which was suitable for locusts to breed. After being converted to perennial water storage, its water storage capacity can meet the irrigation water needs of 1.3 million mu of farmland, providing a sufficient water source for the large-scale change of rice cultivation in this county, and at the same time, it has also developed a fish farming sideline, which is expected to catch 20 million catties of fresh fish every year. Due to perennial water storage, the lake water temperature is reduced, and locusts cannot lay eggs, hatch, or survive, thus clearing the old nests of locusts that have been harmful for years.

　　After the Luoma Lake was rebuilt into a reservoir, the people of the county fully invested in the large-scale construction project of "changing dry land to paddy fields." Everyone clearly knows that through the large-scale conversion of dry land to paddy fields, not only can one harvest a year be changed to two harvests of rice and wheat, but also the environment of the locust area can be changed to achieve the purpose of large-scale eradication of locust plagues. Therefore, people are not afraid of the cold winter months and fight heroically and tenaciously in the icy and snowy fields. Many heroic and exemplary deeds are still unforgettable. Qiu Yue'e, Sheng Shulan, Qiu Shenglan, and other nine women from the Democratic Brigade of Xiaodian Commune were outstanding in locust control last year, and people called them the "Nine Fairies." When the "dry land to paddy field" project started, the "Nine Fairies" formed a combat班[bān - class; team] and came to the construction site, doing even better than other male laborers. The name of the "Nine Fairies" spread throughout the entire construction site.

　　After a winter and a spring of hard work, the members of the commune in the county replanted 340,000 mu of rice. These fields used to have very low yields and were the places where locusts occurred the most. After replanting rice, it not only provided a reliable foundation for increasing grain yield per unit area, but also eradicated locust plagues. Such areas have passed the test of this summer, and no summer locusts have been found in these modified paddy fields.

　　Planting Trees and Greening, Changing the Environment
　　After taking measures to store water and raise fish and large-scale conversion of dry land to paddy fields, the locusts’ base of survival has been greatly compressed, and a few remaining locusts can only rely on idle land such as roadsides and river beaches to hatch and lay eggs. According to this law, Suqian has launched a large-scale greening campaign throughout the county since last year in a planned and conscious manner.

　　A large number of trees have been planted on both sides of the 110-li-long former course of the Yellow River, with a row of apples and a row of willows. In a few years, this will become a "green Great Wall." Ma陵[líng - tumulus; mausoleum] Mountain, where soil locusts and migratory locusts mixed and harmed, has been planted with large areas of grapes, and will soon become a beautiful grape mountain. About 140,000 mu of fruit trees, willow trees, cypress trees, and pine trees have been planted on both sides of the county's highways and trails and on the river beaches. In a few years, evergreen tree-lined roads can be seen everywhere. These trees will all be lush and green in just three to five years. The greening of these areas has taken away the locusts' foothold.

　　Every measure of Suqian County's locust control work is closely integrated with production. In the past, the county generally cultivated extensively, and many areas were sown without plowing. Where cultivation is extensive, locusts also occur the most. After the great leap in agricultural production last year, the habit of extensive cultivation was generally changed, and egg destruction was carried out, reducing the area where locusts occurred. Taking the Qianjin Brigade of Caoji Commune as an example, this production team has more than 3,000 mu of land where locusts occur every year. Last year, the summer locusts that occurred had an average of 20 to 30 heads per square丈[zhàng - a unit of length, equal to 3 1/3 meters]. After these fields were deeply plowed, no summer locusts occurred this year.

　　Continuing to Fight, Eradicating Remaining Locusts
　　Since last year, Suqian County has adopted the method of closely integrating with production, changing the environment of the locust area, and eradicating locusts, which has achieved good results. The county has completely eradicated locusts in 340,000 mu, and the face of the locust area has undergone tremendous changes. Compared with last year, the area of summer locusts that occurred in this county this year decreased from 620,000 mu in the same period last year to 67,000 mu. No summer locusts occurred in the two communes of Dingju and Daxing, where locusts were severe last year. Last year, summer locusts occurred in large areas, but this year they are scattered; last year, there were generally "100 locusts per mu," but this year there is "1 locust per 100 mu." In terms of manpower and material resources, the elimination of summer locusts this year cost 40,000 fewer laborers and 200,000 catties less locust control powder than in the same period last year.

　　The people of Suqian have not become paralyzed and complacent because of these achievements. At present, commune members in the locust area are investigating the situation of autumn locusts and are always on guard. They will do their best to sweep away the autumn locusts to expand the results of locust control and strive to completely eradicate locust plagues throughout the county. (Attached picture)

    昔日蝗虫窝　今日丰产区
    江苏宿迁县改变蝗区环境根治蝗害侧记
    本报记者　姜韦才
    听说宿迁治蝗工作搞得很出色，许多到那里参观的人都赞不绝口，我因慕名走访了一次。
    果然名不虚传，这儿的蝗区面貌已经发生根本的变化。谁会想到，这个历来出名的江苏重点蝗区之一的县分，今年发生的受蝗面积比去年同期减少了90.2％。为什么竟然在一年之间发生了如此巨大的变化？最主要的原因是在大规模消灭夏蝗以后，这里实现了公社化。人民公社给根治蝗害带来从没有过的优越条件。
      英雄摆阵湖荡鏖兵
    宿迁县有不下五十万亩面积的湖荡地区和四十二万亩平岗地带。这些地方人烟稀少，土地广阔，大部分是一年一熟，因此成为蝗虫孵化产卵的“自由天地”，每年发生的蝗虫面积达到六十万亩左右。因此，宿迁人民都把战胜蝗害作为保证丰收的主要任务，每年都与蝗害展开激烈的战斗。
    去年是解放以来发生蝗虫最多的一年。全县发生的夏蝗、秋蝗面积达到一百零八万亩（其中夏蝗六十二万亩，秋蝗四十六万亩），遍及十五个乡。人们和蝗虫斗争是猛烈的。当夏蝗发生时，全县立即出动五万多人，兵分数十路，在湖荡里、河滩上、庄稼地里摆开阵势向蝗虫开火，一千多名侦察兵，出没在每一个蝗区侦查蝗情，不让一个蝗虫有藏身之地。
    战斗在蝗虫老窠——骆马湖心的一万二千名治蝗健儿，摆成一条条长蛇阵，从四面八方围剿蝗虫。他们为了迅速扑灭蝗害，都就地安营扎寨，埋锅造饭，吃在阵地，睡在阵地，战斗在阵地，一刻也不离开阵地。他们响亮地提出“打蝗如打虎，不灭蝗虫不罢休”的战斗口号，采取晴天猛打，小雨大打，大雨也打的方法，不放过一头蝗虫，不让一头蝗虫有逃生之地。小店公社民主大队一支二千名十五岁左右的童子军经过半个月战斗，捕打蝗虫十二万多只。这些小英雄，心灵手巧，打起蝗虫来比年岁大的人还强。
    五万治蝗大军以坚韧不拔的意志，英勇顽强的战斗精神，经过四十五天奋战，全部扑灭了这场来势凶猛的蝗害，仅是人工捕打的蝗虫即达五万六千八百多斤。全县人民也正是以这种战斗精神，在党和政府的领导和大力支援下，一年又一年、一次又一次地战胜了蝗灾，保住了粮食、油料等农作物年年丰收。
    消灭老窠，一箭双雕
    年年打蝗虫，年年有蝗虫，几千年就是这样。但是，这种情况正在被人们改变着。英雄的宿迁人民，经过多年来的探索，终于摸到了一条根治蝗害的经验，这条经验就是：紧密结合生产，通过蓄水养鱼，旱田改水田，绿化和精耕细作等方法，改变蝗区环境，大面积的根除蝗害。
    还在去年春天，中共宿迁县委为了提高粮食单位面积产量，提高人民生活水平，决定将面积最大的骆马湖（四十万亩）改为常年水库，并在全县范围内大面积改种水稻，逐步实现：平湖地区种水稻，湖洼蓄水养鱼虾，黄河滩上栽果树，马陵山上种葡萄，精耕细作园田化，路埂、河堤全绿化。蝗区的环境改变了，就彻底消灭了蝗虫。
    去年麦收以后，为害最大的蝗虫老窠——骆马湖改建了水库。过去，这个湖基本上是个旱湖，每年6、7两月有水，一年长一熟麦子，适于蝗虫孳生。改为常年蓄水以后，它的蓄水量能满足一百三十万亩农田灌溉用水需要，给这个县大面积改变水稻提供了充足水源，同时，还发展了养鱼副业，预计每年可捞鲜鱼二千万斤。由于常年蓄水，湖水温度降低，蝗虫无法产卵、孵化和生存，这样，清剿了历年为害的蝗虫老窠。
    骆马湖改建水库以后，全县人民全力投入了规模宏大的“旱田改水田”的建设工程。每个人都清楚地知道，通过大面积旱田改水田，不仅能够变一年一熟为稻麦两熟，而且可以改变蝗区环境，达到大面积根除蝗害的目的。因此，人们不畏寒冬腊月，英勇顽强地奋战在冰天雪地里。许多英雄模范事迹，人们至今念念不忘。晓店公社民主大队的仇月娥、盛淑兰、仇盛兰等九个妇女，去年在治蝗时，本领出众，人们都称她们是“九仙女”。“旱改水”工程开始，“九仙女”又组成了一个战斗班来到工地，比别的男劳动力还要干得出色。“九仙女”的名字传遍了整个工地。
    全县公社的社员经过一冬一春的奋战以后，改种了三十四万亩水稻。这些田过去产量很低，又是发生蝗虫最多的地方。改种水稻以后，不仅为提高粮食单位面积产量提供了可靠的基础，而且根除了蝗害。这样的地区已经过今年夏季的考验，这些改制的水田，没有发现一头夏蝗。
    植树绿化，改变环境
    采取蓄水养鱼和大面积旱田改水田的措施以后，大大压缩了蝗虫生存的基地，少数残蝗只能依附路边、河滩等空闲地孵化、产卵。根据这个规律，宿迁自去年以来，便有计划有意识地在全县范围内展开了大规模的绿化运动。
    在长达一百一十华里的黄河故道两旁栽植了大量的树木，一行苹果一行柳，几年之后，这里将成为一条“绿色的长城”。土蝗、飞蝗混杂为害的马陵山，已栽植了大片的葡萄，不久将成为一座美丽的葡萄山。全县的公路、小道两旁和河滩上栽植了约十四万亩的果树、柳树、柏树、松树，几年之后，这里到处都可以看见四季常青的林荫道。这些树木，只需三、五年时间就都绿树成荫了。这些地带的绿化，夺去了蝗虫立足之地。
    宿迁县治蝗工作的每一项措施，都是紧密结合生产进行的。过去，这个县普遍耕作粗放，许多地区都是不耕就种的。那儿耕作粗放，那儿的蝗虫发生也最多。去年农业生产大跃进以后，普遍改变了耕作粗放的习惯、进行灭卵，缩小了蝗虫发生的面积。以曹集公社前进大队为例，这个生产队有三千多亩土地每年要发生蝗虫，去年发生的夏蝗，平均每方丈有二十到三十头。这些田经过深耕，今年没发生一头夏蝗。
    继续奋战，根除残蝗
    由去年以来，宿迁县采取紧密结合生产，改变蝗区环境，根除蝗虫的方法，收到了良好的效果，全县已彻底根除蝗虫三十四万亩，蝗区面貌起了巨大的变化。如果和去年比较，这个县今年发生的夏蝗面积由去年同期六十二万亩减少到六万七千亩，去年蝗虫严重的丁咀、大兴两个公社，今年没有发生一头夏蝗。去年的夏蝗是大片大片的发生，今年却是零零星星；去年普遍是“一亩百头蝗”，今年是“百亩一头蝗”。从人力物力上看，今年消灭夏蝗的时候，比去年同期少花四万多个劳动力，少用二十万斤治蝗虫的药粉。
    宿迁人民并没有因为取得这些成绩而麻痹自满。目前，蝗区公社社员正在侦查秋蝗情况，时刻戒备着。他们将用全力扫荡秋蝗，来扩大治蝗战果，力争在全县范围内彻底根除蝗害。（附图片）
