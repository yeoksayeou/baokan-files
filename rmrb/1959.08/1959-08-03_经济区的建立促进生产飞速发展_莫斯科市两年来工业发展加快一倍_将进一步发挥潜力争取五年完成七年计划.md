Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st. Borisov, First Deputy Chairman of the Moscow City National Economic Committee, recently told our reporter that the Moscow City Economic Zone has proposed to complete the industrial production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) two years ahead of schedule. According to the production development speed of the economic zone in the past two years since its establishment, this guarantee can be realized.

Borisov said that in 1957, the production growth rate of enterprises under the Moscow City Economic Zone was 5%, 7% in 1958, and this year's rate will exceed 10%. This means that in the two years since the establishment of the National Economic Committee, the growth rate of Moscow's industrial production has doubled. He said that the reason for the accelerated production growth rate is not due to the construction of new factories, but due to the exploitation of the internal potential of enterprises. The Moscow City Economic Zone has a total of 435 enterprises, which were previously led by 36 ministries, and machine-manufacturing enterprises alone were scattered under the leadership of 16 ministries. After the establishment of the economic zone, the management of these enterprises was concentrated and unified, which greatly facilitated the cooperation between enterprises and the exploration of internal potential.

In the past two years, one of the biggest potentials discovered by the Moscow City Economic Zone is the implementation of production specialization. For example, due to the fact that Moscow industrial enterprises were previously managed by various ministries, they established many small, high-cost, and low-mechanization foundries. After the establishment of the economic zone, 60% of the small foundries were closed, and large-scale mechanized specialized foundries were established to supply castings uniformly to various enterprises. In the future, the Moscow City Economic Zone will continue to carry out specialization work. Among the more than 400 factories, about 300 factories will implement specialization. The Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory will become a factory specializing in the production of trucks, and many other factories will also cancel the production of some products and implement product unification and component standardization in order to carry out large-scale production and specialization. This year, the economic zone used 163 million rubles for specialization, however, the funds saved due to the implementation of specialization will reach 257 million rubles.

Another important potential for the Moscow City Economic Zone to accelerate the development of production is to implement technological transformation and renovate existing equipment. Since the industrial enterprises are now under the unified leadership of the economic zone, this work is done more timely and conveniently than in the past.

Related to this is the implementation of automation and overall mechanization. The experience of the two years since the establishment of the economic zone has proved that this is a great source of potential. During the Seven-Year Plan period, the Moscow City Economic Zone will establish 400 automated production lines, and more than 40 automated production lines will be established this year. In the past, only two factories produced automated production lines, but now the number has increased to five. Some outdated lathes will be replaced from production one after another. Replacing them will be many automated and semi-automated lathes, automatic control instruments and special-purpose lathes.

Regarding the issue of cooperation between economic zones, Borisov said that when the economic zones were established, the biggest concerns were the cooperation between economic zones and the possible emergence of localism. The situation in the Moscow Economic Zone proves that cooperation can be strengthened and localism can be avoided. The first is to continuously strengthen political and ideological work among cadres, and educate cadres to treat their careers with party spirit and communist spirit. The second is that the government implements strict supervision and has formulated special laws. Holding certain meetings and signing contracts between economic zones is the main form of cooperation.

    经济区的建立促进生产飞速发展
    莫斯科市两年来工业发展加快一倍
    将进一步发挥潜力争取五年完成七年计划
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　莫斯科市国民经济委员会第一副主席鲍利索夫最近对本社记者说，莫斯科市经济区已经提出要提前两年完成七年计划（1959—1965年）规定的工业生产任务。根据经济区成立两年来生产发展速度的情况看来，这个保证是可以实现的。
    鲍利索夫说，1957年，莫斯科市经济区所属各企业的生产增长速度是5％，1958年是7％，而今年的速度将超过10％。这就是说，国民经济委员会成立两年来，莫斯科工业生产增长速度加快了一倍。他说，生产增长速度之所以加快，这不是由于新建了工厂，而是由于发挥了企业的内部潜力。莫斯科市经济区共有四百三十五家企业，它们过去分别由三十六个部领导，仅机器制造业的企业就分散由十六个部领导。经济区成立后，这些企业的管理集中统一了，因而大大便利了各企业之间的协作和发掘内部潜力。
    两年来，莫斯科市经济区发掘出来的一个最大的潜力是实行了生产专业化。例如，莫斯科工业企业过去由于分属各部管理的缘故，建立了许多小型的、成本高、机械化程度低的铸造车间。经济区成立以后，关闭了60％的小型铸造车间，建立了大型的机械化的专业化的铸造工厂，统一为各企业供应铸件。今后，莫斯科市经济区将继续进行专业化的工作。在四百多家工厂中，将有约三百家工厂要实行专业化。莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂要变成专门生产载重汽车的工厂，其他许多工厂也将取消一些产品的生产，实行产品统一化、部件标准化，以便进行大规模生产和实行专业化。今年，经济区用来进行专业化的费用是一亿六千三百万卢布，然而，由于实行专业化而节约下来的资金就将达二亿五千七百万卢布。
    莫斯科市经济区加快生产发展速度的另一个重要潜力是实行技术改造、革新现有设备。由于各工业企业现在归经济区统一领导，因此，这方面的工作作起来就比过去及时方便。
    与此有关的是实行自动化和全盘机械化。经济区成立两年来的经验证明，这是一个很大的发挥潜力的源泉。七年计划期间，莫斯科市经济区将建立四百条自动化作业线，今年就要建立四十多条自动化作业线。过去只有两个工厂生产自动化作业线，现在已经增加到五家。一些过时的车床将要陆续从生产中更换。代替它们的将是许多自动化和半自动化的车床、自动控制仪器和专用的车床。
    关于各经济区的协作问题，鲍利索夫说，在成立经济区时，大家最担心的问题是各经济区之间的协作和可能出现地方主义情绪的问题。莫斯科经济区的情况证明协作可以加强，地方主义情绪可以避免。第一是干部中不断加强政治思想工作，教育干部以党性和共产主义精神对待事业。其次是政府实行严格的监督，制定了专门的法律。各经济区之间召开一定会议订立合同，是协作的主要形式。
