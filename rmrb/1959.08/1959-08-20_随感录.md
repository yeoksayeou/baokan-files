　　The Three Stages of Learning

　　Wang Guowei said that those who achieve great things and profound knowledge in ancient and modern times must go through three stages: "Last night, the west wind withered the green trees, I climbed the high tower alone, gazing at the end of the world," this is the first stage. "My robe grows ever looser, but I do not regret it, for you I waste away," this is the second stage. "I searched for her in the crowd a thousand times, then suddenly turning my head, I find her where the lanterns dimly shine," this is the third stage.

　　To do scholarship, one must open one's eyes and not be limited to a corner like a frog at the bottom of a well; this is the meaning of the first stage. The second stage requires diving in, thinking hard, forgetting to eat and sleep; this requires a bit of self-sacrifice, otherwise it cannot be achieved. The third stage is finally gaining some understanding, which is the result of going through the first and second stages.

　　Due to my work, I often have the opportunity to read manuscripts submitted by authors. Some manuscripts are hundreds of thousands of words long and pile up on a table. But when asked about the content, one cannot help but be disappointed. They are patched together, copied from here and there, the materials are not fresh, and the viewpoints follow what others say. I would like to make a dogmatic inference: probably the authors of such manuscripts have not experienced those three stages.

　　Cannot Speculate for Personal Gain

　　Scientific research must be done with hard work and down-to-earth efforts. Any speculation for personal gain or "following the fashion" will not achieve the goal. I suddenly remembered a story I read in a book:

　　The University of Alexandria in ancient Egypt hired Euclid, the famous mathematician of the time, to teach mathematics. The Egyptian king also went to be a student. This student was stumped by the difficult math problems and became very annoyed. Once, he asked his teacher Euclid, "Studying mathematics is really too troublesome. Is there a particularly simple way for us kings?" Euclid replied, "No, there isn't. My mathematics is the same for everyone."

　　Ten Eyes per Line

　　Some people read books only for speed, thinking that ten lines per glance are too slow, and they would prefer a hundred or a thousand lines per glance to enjoy themselves. Ruan Yuan, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, strongly opposed this kind of reading, saying: "People often boast about the talent of reading ten lines at a glance, but I laugh at it—only reading with ten eyes per line is truly reading."

　　Ten eyes per line is considered reading seriously. This sentence is thought-provoking. Of course, not all books need to be read in this way; those that should be skimmed can still be skimmed. But important books, such as classics, should always be read in this way.

    为学的三境界
    王国维说古今之成大事业大学问者，必须经过三种境界：昨夜西风雕碧树，独上高楼，望尽天涯路，此第一境也。衣带渐宽终不悔，为伊消得人憔悴，此第二境也。众里寻他千百度，蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处，此第三境也。
    做学问必须开放眼光，不要像井底之蛙局限于一隅之见，这是第一境的意思。第二境要求钻进去，苦思力索，废寝忘餐，这要有点自我牺牲的精神，否则是达不到的。第三境是终于有所悟获，这是经历过了第一、第二两境的结果。
    笔者由于工作的关系，经常得有机会读到一些作者投来的书稿。有的稿子洋洋数十万言，摆起来堆满一桌子。可是要问内容如何，却不免令人失望。七拼八凑，东抄西摘，材料既不新鲜，观点也都是跟着人讲。我想作个武断的推论：大概这样书稿的作者是没有经历那三境界的。
　　不能投机取巧
    科学研究的工作必须埋头苦干，踏踏实实。任何投机取巧，“赶时髦”都达不到目的。忽然想起了哪本书上讲到这样一个故事：
    古代埃及的亚力山大大学聘请了当时著名的数学家欧克里德主讲数学课。埃及国王也去当学生。这个学生被繁难的数学习题难倒了，感到十分恼火。一次，他问他的老师欧克里德说：“研究数学实在太麻烦了。对我们当国王的人有什么特别简单一点的办法没有？”欧回答说：“没有，没有。我的数学对于一切人都是一样的。”
    十目一行
    有的人读书一味贪快，一目十行还嫌太慢，最好是一目百行、千行才过瘾。清代学者阮元很反对这样的读书法，他说：“世人每矜一目十行之才，余哂之，——夫必十目一行，始是真能读书也。”
    十目一行，才算是认真读书。这句话耐人深省。当然不必所有书都这样读，该浏览的还是可以浏览。可是读重要的书，比如经典著作之类总该如此。
