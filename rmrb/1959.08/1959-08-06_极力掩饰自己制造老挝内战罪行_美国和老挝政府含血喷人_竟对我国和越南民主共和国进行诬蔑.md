Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th - Vientiane dispatch: The Lao Kingdom Government's Propaganda Department issued a statement on the 4th, baselessly slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos. In this statement, broadcast by Vientiane Radio, the Lao Kingdom Government desperately tried to conceal the facts of its reckless undermining of the Geneva Accords and expansion of the civil war under the direction of the United States, and slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for aiding Lao "rebels" and "threatening Laos."

Prior to this, the Lao Kingdom Government's Propaganda Department also issued a communique on the 3rd, falsely accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's army of attacking Lao border strongholds.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th - Washington dispatch: The United States State Department has issued statements on the situation in Laos twice in the last three days, distorting the truth about the cause of the Lao civil war and slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.

After issuing a statement on July 30th, State Department spokesman Repp issued another statement on the Lao situation on the evening of August 1st. In the statement, he attempted to use the method of reversing black and white to cover up the truth that the United States instigated the Sananikone regime to provoke the Lao civil war, falsely accusing the outbreak of the Lao civil war as "possibly a serious crisis instigated by the communist imperialists in the Far East," and that the Vietnamese and Chinese governments "do not like" any "normalization of the situation along" their "borders," but "would rather maintain a turbulent situation in Southeast Asia." But the truth is that it is the United States itself that does not want the situation on the Vietnamese and Chinese borders to normalize and "would rather maintain a turbulent situation in Southeast Asia."

The State Department's statement defended the Lao authorities' brazen tearing up of the Geneva Accords and launching of the civil war, and slandered the former Lao fighting forces, who were forced to rise up in self-defense, as "with the support of communist conspirators on the other side of the Lao border," "disregarding the obligations undertaken under the Geneva Accords," and "obstructing the consolidation of a neutral Laos."

    极力掩饰自己制造老挝内战罪行
    美国和老挝政府含血喷人
    竟对我国和越南民主共和国进行诬蔑
    据新华社河内5日电　万象消息：老挝王国政府宣传部4日发表一项声明，毫无根据地诬蔑越南民主共和国对老挝进行干涉。老挝王国政府在这项由万象电台广播的声明中，极力掩饰它在美国指使下肆无忌惮地破坏日内瓦协议和扩大内战的事实，并且诬蔑越南民主共和国援助老挝的“叛乱分子”和“威胁老挝”。
    在此以前，老挝王国政府宣传部还曾经在3日发表公报，诬指越南民主共和国的军队进攻老挝的边境据点。
    据新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院最近三天中两次就老挝局势发表声明，歪曲老挝内战起因的真相，诬蔑越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国。
    国务院发言人里普继7月30日发表声明以后，8月1日晚间再次就老挝局势发表声明。他在声明中企图用颠倒黑白的手法来掩饰美国唆使萨纳尼空政权挑起老挝内战的真象，诬蔑老挝内战的发生“可能是远东的共产帝国主义者企图挑起一次严重的危机”，越南和中国政府
  “不喜欢”自己“边界沿线的局势有什么正常化”，而“宁愿保持东南亚的动乱局面”。而事实真象却是，不愿越南和中国边界局势正常化，而且“宁愿保持东南亚动乱局面”的，正是美国自己。
    国务院的声明为老挝当局悍然撕毁日内瓦协议和发动内战的行为辩护，并且诬蔑被迫起而自卫的前寮国战斗部队是在“老挝边界那边的共产党共谋者的支持下”，“不顾对日内瓦协议承担的义务”，“阻挠一个中立老挝的巩固。”
