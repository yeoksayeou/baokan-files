　　Taking the World as One's Responsibility
　　Tan Qing
　　"Moonlight on the Eastern Wall" is a novel, and naturally not everything in it is true. For example, within two days and two nights in a production team, in front of a production team leader, it might not be so coincidental to encounter such a long string of events, resulting in the leader not sleeping or eating, running around doing this and that. But looking at these events one by one, they are all bound to happen in every production team; if a production team leader like Shang Youpeng really encountered such a string of events, then he would definitely handle them as he does in the story. Therefore, when we read it, we always feel that it is a true story; and we might as well treat it as a true story and discuss it.
　　All of Shang Youpeng's actions are the manifestations of his transformation from a "rake" into "one of the Party." A "rake" and a "box" can live at odds with each other, but "one of the Party" and a "box" cannot work together. Therefore, the contradiction and conflict between Shang Youpeng and Aunt Shang is essentially the contradiction and conflict between the collectivism of the Communists and the selfishness of the "box."
　　"The man is like a rake, the woman is like a box" is a very popular saying in northern rural areas. In the past, it was often a compliment to good, thrifty couples. It meant that the man could earn things for the family, and the woman would save, so it was mainly praise, with very little derogatory meaning. Now it is different. People's social relationships have changed. In addition to the family, people have production teams, communes, and the country. If people only care about the family and not about the team, the commune, or the country, only care about themselves and not about others, then the original "rake" and "box," which were mainly good, have now become selfish, self-interested and backward.
　　Thus, Shang Youpeng, who became a Communist Party member, transformed from a "rake" at home to "giving his whole heart to the cooperative." "He regarded even a thread in the cooperative as a treasure, and he wouldn't feel pain even if someone cut flesh from his body for someone from another family." What about the affairs of his own family? Not only did he not "calculate every penny" as before, but sometimes he even had to pay out of his own pocket first, or lend out his quilts. How could this not make Aunt Shang, who was still a "box," feel sad and pained?
　　The transformation from a "rake" to "one of the Party" is a "major change in people's hearts." It is a spiritual sublimation, a complete change.
　　"One of the Party" is different from ordinary people, and even more different from the original "rake." He must take the world as his responsibility. He says, "The team leader has to manage everything," "If I, the team leader, don't manage it, who will?" He has to manage production, and also "manage people's childbirth, manage people's sleep, and manage people's shoes..." In the eyes of "box"-like figures, this is like madness, but in the eyes of "one of the Party," it is a matter of course. He does it with relish, full of joy. Some people think that Communists are ascetics, lacking in emotional appeal, but this is because their taste is low, and they cannot understand the noble aspirations of Communists. Communists understand joy the most. Communists take pleasure in helping others, take pleasure in public enjoyment, and take pleasure in the happiness of the world. Their joy is endless.
　　This kind of joy is increasingly being experienced and enjoyed by more and more people. Therefore, the "rake" can change greatly, and the "box" can also be opened. Aunt Shang originally didn't know that her husband was already one of the Party and still demanded him according to the standards of a "rake," so she felt that nothing went smoothly, and she was very awkward and sad. But when she heard that her husband was "one of the Party," she suddenly understood and stopped holding him back. It can be seen that she also understands what "one of the Party" should be like. Then, with the help and education of the collective, won't the "box" also slowly open up?

　　以天下为己任
　　谭青
    “月照东墙”是一篇小说，事情自然并非都是真的，例如在一个生产队里，在一个生产队长面前，两天两夜之内，就未必会那样凑巧地碰上这么一大串事，结果弄得那位队长觉也不睡，饭也不吃，东奔西跑干这干那。但是一件一件地来看这些事，它们又都是每一个生产队里不免要发生的；像尚友朋这样的一个生产队长，如果真的碰到了这样一串事情，那末，他一定也会像现在这样处理的。所以，我们读起来，总又觉得它是真事；而且，不妨当作真事来加以谈论。
    尚友朋的这一切作为，是由“筢子”变成“党里的人”以后的表现。“筢子”和“匣子”可以拧着劲过日子，“党里的人”和“匣子”却无法拧成一股劲。所以，尚友朋和尚大娘的矛盾和冲突，实质上就是共产党人的集体主义和“匣子”的自私自利思想的矛盾和冲突。
    “男的像筢子，女的像匣子”这句话在北方农村里很流行。过去，这常常是对勤俭过日子的好夫妻们的赞誉。意思是说男的能往家挣东西，女的会积攒，因此，这主要是褒，极少有贬的成份。现在不同了，人们的社会关系变了，除了家以外，人们有了生产队、公社、国家，如果人们还只关心家，而不关心队、社、国家，只关心自己，不关心别人，那末，原来主要还是好的那种“筢子”和“匣子”，现在便变成自私自利和落后的了。
    于是，成了共产党员的尚友朋，由家里的一把“筢子”一变而“把一颗心都掏给社里了。”“社里的一条线头，他都看成宝贝，为两姓旁人，割他身上的肉都不喊疼”。对家里的事呢？不仅不像以前那样“大小算盘”都打地搂回来，而且，有时还要把家里的钱先垫出来，把被子借出来，这怎能不使仍还是“匣子”的尚大娘感到伤心和痛苦呢？
    由“筢子”变成“党里的人”，是一种“人心大变”。是精神上的升华，也是脱胎换骨。
  “党里的人”不同于一般人，更不同于原来的“筢子”，他要以天下为己任，他说，“队长什么都得管”，“我队长不管谁管”？他要管生产，也要“管人家生孩子，管人家睡觉，又管人家穿鞋子……”这在“匣子”式的人物看来，像是疯子，但在“党里的人”看来，却是天经地义，理所当然。作起来津津有味，乐趣盎然。有人以为共产党人都是苦行僧，缺少情趣，其实，这是由于他们格调低下，无法了解共产党人这种高尚的志趣而造成的。共产党人最懂乐趣，共产党人以助人为乐，以享公为乐，以天下之乐为乐，其乐无穷。
    这种乐趣，正越来越为更多的人所体会所享受。因而，“筢子”能够大变，“匣子”也是能够打开的。尚大娘原来不知道丈夫已经是党里的人，仍然按照“筢子”来要求，所以她觉得左不顺手右不好使，蹩扭和伤心得很。但当她一旦听说丈夫是个“党里的人了”的时候，她便恍然大悟，再不去拉他的后腿了。可见她也懂得一个“党里的人”是应该怎样的。那么，在集体的帮助和教育下，“匣子”岂不也要慢慢地打开来吗？
