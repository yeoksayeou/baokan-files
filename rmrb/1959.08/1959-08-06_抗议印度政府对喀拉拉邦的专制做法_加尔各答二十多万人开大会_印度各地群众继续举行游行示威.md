Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 4th: According to the Indian News Agency, a mass rally of over 200,000 people was held in Calcutta, India's largest city, on the 3rd, protesting the Indian Central Government's decision to dissolve the former Kerala State Government. The rally passed a resolution condemning the Central Government's interference in the former Kerala State Government as an autocratic practice and a "serious blow to Indian democracy."

This mass rally was held at the call of the Communist Party of India and the Marxist Forward Bloc. A demonstration procession of over 100,000 people marched eight miles in the rain. Participants included members of sixty trade unions and thousands of farmers, some of whom came from areas near Calcutta, walking over twenty miles. Several thousand women also participated in the rally.

It is reported that many prominent social figures, editors, professors, members of the Legislative Assembly, and municipal councilors in Calcutta held two gatherings on the 2nd. Resolutions were passed at the meetings praising the former Kerala State Government for serving the cause of democracy from the perspective of the people's interests and for its selfless dedication.

Madras, a major city in southern India, held a parade and mass rally on the 3rd, attended by over 100,000 workers. They held aloft placards calling on democratic forces to unite and defeat the conspiracies of anti-democratic forces, and shouted slogans such as "Oppose Central Interference."

At this mass rally, Indian Communist Party leader Ramamurti and former Kerala State Education Minister Mundasseri both spoke. They accused the Congress Party of deliberately ousting the former Kerala State Government to please landlords and vested interest groups.

In Bombay, the largest city on the west coast, August 2nd was observed as "Protest Day." On this day, the Communist Party and four other left-wing parties jointly held a large-scale parade and mass rally. As the parade passed through the city's industrial area, a large number of workers joined the procession.

Speaking at the mass rally, Communist Party leader Dange pointed out that the Congress Party instigated reactionary and communal forces to overthrow the progressive government of the former Kerala State.

In Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, when the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly refused to allow a discussion on an interim motion regarding central interference in Kerala, members of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and some independent members walked out of the assembly. Subsequently, at the call of the Communist Party organization in the state, a demonstration and mass rally were held in front of the parliament building.

In Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, a large parade organized by the Communist Party of India marched to the governor's residence and submitted a memorandum protesting the actions of the central government. Demonstrators wore black armbands, carried red and black flags, and held placards condemning the interference in the former Kerala State Government.

Similar demonstrations were also held in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, Bangalore, the capital of Mysore, as well as Simla, Amritsar, Allahabad, Mangalore, and many other places.

According to the Indian News Agency in Trivandrum, after the President of India issued a proclamation on July 31st taking over the former Kerala State Government, the working class in Kerala immediately launched a large-scale strike on August 1st to protest this action by the central government.

The report said that in Trivandrum, it is estimated that nearly ten thousand workers went on strike.

    印度各地群众继续举行游行示威
    据新华社新德里4日电　据印度新闻社报道，印度最大城市加尔各答在3日举行了有二十多万人参加的群众大会，抗议印度中央政府解散前喀拉拉邦政府的行动。大会通过决议，指责中央政府对前喀拉拉邦政府的干涉是专制的做法，和“对印度民主的严重打击”。
    这个群众大会是在印度共产党和马克思主义者前进同盟的号召下举行的。有十万多人的示威游行队伍冒雨走了八英里的路程。参加大会的有六十个工会的会员和数千农民，其中有些农民来自加尔各答附近地区，他们步行了二十多英里。参加大会的还有几千名妇女。
    据报道，在加尔各答的许多著名社会人士，编辑、教授、立法会议议员和市参议员曾经在2日举行了两次集会。会上通过了决议，赞扬前喀拉拉邦政府从人民的利益出发为民主事业服务的功绩以及它的无私的献身精神。
    印度南部主要城市马德拉斯在3日举行了有十多万职工参加的游行和群众大会。他们高举着号召民主力量团结起来击败反民主势力的阴谋的标语牌。并且高呼“反对中央干涉”的口号。
    在这次群众大会上，印度共产党领袖拉马穆蒂和前喀拉拉邦教育部长孟达塞里都讲了话。他们指责国大党蓄意赶走前喀拉拉邦政府，以取悦地主和既得利益集团。
    在西海岸最大城市孟买，8月2日举行了“抗议日”。这一天，共产党和其它四个左翼政党联合举行了大规模的游行和群众大会。游行队伍经过这个城市的工业区时，大批工人参加了游行队伍。
    共产党领袖丹吉在群众大会上讲话时指出，国大党带动了反动派和教族势力搞垮了前喀拉拉邦的进步政府。
    在北方邦的勒克瑙，当邦立法会议议长不准许讨论关于中央干涉喀拉拉邦的临时动议时，共产党、社会党和某些无党派的议员退出了会场。随后，在这个邦的共产党组织号召下，在议会大楼面前举行了示威和群众大会。
    在旁遮普邦首府昌迪拉尔，由印度共产党组织的庞大的游行队伍走到邦长的官邸，递交了抗议中央的行动的备忘录。示威者佩着黑色的标志，举着红色和黑色的旗帜以及谴责干涉前喀拉拉邦政府的标语牌。
    在中央邦首府波保尔、迈索尔邦首府班加罗尔以及西姆拉、阿姆利则、阿拉哈巴德、曼加罗和其它许多地方也举行了类似的示威游行。
    据印度新闻社特里凡得琅消息，在印度总统7月31日发布了接管前喀拉拉邦政府的公告以后，喀拉拉邦的工人阶级紧接着在8月1日自动举行了大规模的罢工，抗议中央采取的这种行动。
    消息说，在特里凡得琅，估计将近有一万名工人举行了罢工。
