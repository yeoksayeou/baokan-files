The Ministry of Agriculture requires all regions to:
Apply more topdressing to ensure a bumper harvest of bast fiber crops.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice requiring all regions to strengthen field management of bast fiber crops.

The notice said: Bast fiber crops require a lot of fertilizer, and field management work centered on applying more topdressing has already begun in key bast fiber production areas across the country.

However, the development of bast fiber field management work is uneven in various places, and progress is slow in some areas. The notice pointed out that, given the insufficient application of base fertilizer in some bast fiber fields, universally applying more topdressing to promote tillering is the foundation for striving for increased production this year. Currently, jute and wheat stubble hemp have generally grown to over a foot tall and have entered a period of vigorous growth, so it is necessary to seize the opportunity to apply more topdressing. The second harvest of ramie is about to be reaped, and fertilizer should be applied immediately after harvesting to promote the growth of the third harvest. If the new ramie is not growing well, do not harvest the second crop; instead, apply fertilizer to strive for a bumper harvest of the third crop. If late-sown kenaf shows signs of nutrient deficiency, apply fertilizer to promote growth.

The notice said that bast fiber crops also require a lot of water, so it is necessary to utilize all water sources and irrigation facilities to irrigate in a timely manner. At the same time, drainage ditches should be dug in bast fiber fields to prevent waterlogging.

The notice pointed out that this year's bast fiber seed retention task is very large, and bast fiber planting areas should arrange sufficient seed collection fields.

Anhui's bast fiber production is developing rapidly

Our newspaper Hefei, August 4th: Anhui Province's bast fiber production has greatly developed this year, with the planting area of various bast fiber crops increasing by more than 169,000 mu compared to last year. The harvesting of hemp is now over, and farmers in various places are strengthening the field management of jute and ramie to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of various bast fiber crops.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of hemp, the counties in the main hemp-producing areas of Lu'an, Fuyang, and Bengbu prefectures all carried out deep plowing and rational close planting before sowing hemp, and grasped field management after sowing. As a result, the hemp grew with thick stems and tall stalks. The hemp in Lu'an Prefecture has grown to over ten feet tall, and generally six to seven feet tall.

The planting area of ramie and jute in the province has also expanded compared to last year. The first harvest of ramie has now been reaped, with a yield of about 130 jin per mu. (Han Guozhen)

Distribution and Uses of Bast Fiber Crops

China is a country rich in bast fiber resources. The areas south of the Yangtze River are the main producing areas of jute and ramie; Heilongjiang and Jilin are the main producing areas of flax; the low-lying areas of North China and Northeast China are the main producing areas of kenaf; hemp is the most widely distributed and cultivated everywhere; and ambary hemp is mainly distributed in North China and Northeast China. Sisal hemp and agave are tropical crops. Sisal hemp is cultivated in Guangdong, Yunnan, Fujian, and Taiwan, and agave has begun to be cultivated in individual areas such as Guangdong.

The fibers of most bast fiber crops grow on the stems, and only the fibers of sisal hemp and agave grow in the leaves. The seeds of bast fiber crops often contain oils.

One of the main uses of bast fiber is to weave sacks. The fibers used for weaving sacks are mostly jute, ambary hemp, and some kenaf.

Bast fiber is also a textile raw material. Jute can be blended with ramie, flax, and cotton to weave durable and beautiful curtain fabrics, tablecloths, sofa fabrics, etc. Ramie can also be spun alone into the specialty Chinese fabric known as Xia Bu (summer cloth).

Ramie can also be used to manufacture conveyor belts for machines, water hoses for water transportation, tire linings, wire wrapping, etc. Some bast fibers can also be used as raw materials for making cigarette paper. The connection between bast fiber and light industrial production is truly intricate.

Ropes made of bast fiber are not only needed for industrial and agricultural production, but are also indispensable for some handicraft production and people's daily lives. Bast fiber and fishery have an inseparable relationship.

Bast fiber also has certain uses in construction and national defense. "Bast fiber mortar," commonly used in construction, is made of bast fiber scraps or waste bast fiber.

Heilongjiang Plants Second Crop of Flax

Our newspaper Harbin, August 3rd: Flax in Heilongjiang Province has always been harvested once a year for fifty years. This year, farmers are harvesting the mature flax while sowing the second crop of flax.

In mid-July, farmers in Acheng and Hulan counties in the southern region took the lead in harvesting flax and simultaneously planted the second crop of flax in the harvested flax fields. The province's most areas are also preparing for replanting while harvesting flax. According to statistics from eleven key flax-growing counties, the plan is to replant 150,000 mu of flax this summer.

The 1.85 million mu of flax being harvested in Heilongjiang Province are expected to have bumper yields due to careful planting, increased fertilizer application, and good management, except for individual areas affected by drought. (Han Zhifei)

The Key to a Bumper Harvest of Bast Fiber

Seizing the opportunity to immediately launch a high tide of bast fiber field management centered on topdressing and irrigation is an important key to obtaining a bumper harvest of bast fiber crops.

Bast fibers are the main raw materials and supplies for the textile industry, light industry, construction industry, and fishery. Jute, ambary hemp, and kenaf fibers can be made into sacks, burlap, and ropes for packaging and transportation. Ramie can be woven into China's specialty summer cloth and fishing nets. Hemp fiber is a good material for manufacturing high-grade cigarette paper. Flax can be woven into various beautiful clothing materials, curtains, tablecloths, and its seeds can be pressed for oil. Apocynum can be blended with wool to weave high-grade clothing materials such as broadcloth and whipcord. And the bast fiber down, scraps, and stalks of various bast fibers are raw materials for the construction industry and light industry. From this, it can be seen that bast fiber crops are an extremely important industrial raw material that cannot be ignored or taken lightly.

The planting area of various bast fibers this year is about the same as last year, but the needs of the state and the people for bast fibers have increased several times over. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to greatly increase the yield per unit area.

According to the growth characteristics of jute, it enters a period of vigorous growth after the plant height reaches one foot, and fertilizer and water must keep up closely to ensure that it is well-fed and watered in order to grow well. Last year, Xiaoshan County's 205,000 mu of jute averaged a high yield of 698 jin per mu. The main reason for this was that they grasped fertilizer and water. Since jute is a fiber crop aimed at obtaining stems, on the basis of a large increase in the application of nitrogen fertilizer, the combined application of some potash fertilizer will have a good effect on thickening the bast fiber skin and increasing drought resistance and pest and disease resistance. Jute stems are tall and require a lot of water, so it is necessary to strengthen bast fiber irrigation work, fully utilize all water sources and equipment, and strive to irrigate in a timely manner to keep the bast fiber fields constantly moist.

This year, the growth of the first crop of ramie is better than last year. The second crop is about to be harvested, and the estimated yield is also higher than last year. Fertilizer should be applied immediately after harvesting the second crop to promote the rapid growth of the third crop. In the past, the yield of the third crop was often only 30% of the first crop. The low yield is mainly because some areas do not pay enough attention to the third crop and do not apply fertilizer or carry out careful management. In fact, the yield of the third crop is not low. As long as management is strengthened, the yield will be greatly increased. Last year, Datong No. 1 Cooperative in Yangxin County, Hubei Province, had a ramie yield of more than 2,000 jin per mu. This was because they strengthened the management of each crop. As long as we vigorously carry out the field management of the third crop, making it as productive as the first and second crops, the total output of ramie this year can greatly exceed last year.

The occurrence of bast fiber pests and diseases in various places is earlier this year than in previous years. It is necessary to treat them early in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. A combination of indigenous and modern methods should be adopted for pesticides, and the role of indigenous pesticides should be fully utilized. The commercial departments should make necessary adjustments to insecticides based on the occurrence of pests and diseases so that pesticides can truly play their due role.

Bast fiber field management centered on topdressing is the main key to a bumper harvest of bast fiber this year. The agricultural departments and people's communes in various bast fiber-producing areas should seize the opportunity and lead the broad masses of commune members to fight this battle well in order to strive for a greater bumper harvest of bast fiber crops.

    加强麻田管理　力争优质高产
    农业部要求各地
    多施追肥保证麻类丰收
    据新华社讯　农业部最近发出通知，要求各地加强麻类作物的田间管理。
    通知说：麻类是需肥较多的作物，全国各重点产麻区，以多施追肥为中心的田间管理工作已经开展。
    但是，各地麻田管理工作的开展情况不平衡，有些地方进展较慢。通知指出，在部分麻田施用基肥不足情况下，普遍多施追肥促使发株，是今年争取增产的基础。目前黄麻及麦茬大麻，一般已经长到一尺以上，已进入盛长时期，必须抓紧时机，多施追肥。苎麻二麻即将收剥，收后即应施肥，以促三麻生长。新麻生长不好的，不要收二麻，应追施肥料争取三麻丰收。晚播的?麻，如有脱肥现象，也要追施肥料，促使生长。
    通知说，麻类也是需要水分较多的作物，必须利用一切水源和灌溉设施适时灌溉；同时要做好麻田开沟排渍，以防内涝。
    通知指出，今年麻类留种任务很大，植麻区要安排足够的采种田。
    安徽麻类生产大发展
    本报合肥4日电　安徽省今年的麻类生产有很大发展，各种麻类的播植面积比去年增加十六万九千多亩。现在大麻收割已结束，各地农民正在加强黄麻、苎麻的田间管理，争取各种麻类作物全面丰收。
    为了争取大麻丰收，主要产麻区的六安、阜阳、蚌埠专区各县，在大麻播种前，都做到深翻地和合理密植，播种后抓紧了田间管理，因而大麻长得茎粗秆高。六安专区的大麻有的长到一丈多高，一般的也有六、七尺高。
    全省的苎麻、黄麻播种面积也比去年扩大，现在苎麻的头遍麻都收剥结束，亩产在一百三十斤左右。　（韩国珍）
    麻的分布及其用途
    我国是麻类资源丰富的国家。长江流域以南各地是黄麻、苎麻的主要产区；黑龙江、吉林是亚麻的主要产区；华北和东北的低洼地区是?麻的主要产区；大麻分布最广，到处都有栽培；洋麻主要分布在华北和东北两地区。剑麻、龙舌兰麻属热带作物。剑麻在广东、云南、福建和台湾都有栽培，龙舌兰麻在广东等地个别地区开始栽培。
    麻类作物的纤维多数是生长在茎秆上，只有剑麻、龙舌兰麻的纤维是在叶片里。麻类作物的种子多含有油脂。
    麻纤维主要用途之一是织麻袋，织麻袋用的纤维多数是黄麻、洋麻，部分是?麻。
    麻纤维也是纺织原料。黄麻可以和苎麻、亚麻、棉花混纺成既耐用又好看的窗帘布、桌布、沙发布等。苎麻还可以单独纺织成我国特产夏布。
    苎麻还可以制造机器上用的传送带，输水用的水龙带，轮胎里布，电线的包布等。有些麻纤维还可以作造卷烟纸的原料。麻纤维和轻工业生产的联系真是千丝万缕。
    麻作的绳索不仅工农业生产需要，一些手工业生产和人民日常生活中也离不了它。麻和渔业更有一种不可分的关联。
    麻在建筑上、国防上也有一定用处。建筑上常用的“麻刀”，就是麻屑或废麻制成的。
    黑龙江种二季亚麻
    本报哈尔滨3日电　黑龙江省的亚麻，五十年来一直是一年收获一次。今年农民一面拔成熟了的亚麻，一面播种第二季亚麻。
    7月中旬，南部地区的阿城、呼兰两县农民，领先拔麻，同时又在收获了的亚麻田里种上了第二季亚麻。全省大部分地区也在收麻的同时，进行复种的准备工作。据十一个种植亚麻的重点县统计，今夏计划复种十五万亩亚麻。
    黑龙江省正在收获的一百八十五万亩亚麻，由于种的细致、增施肥料、管理较好，除个别地区因为干旱外，大部地区的亚麻获得了丰收。　（韩之非）
    麻田丰收的关键
    抓紧时机，立即开展一个以追肥、灌溉为中心的麻田管理高潮，是麻类作物获得丰产的重要关键。
    麻类纤维是纺织工业、轻工业、建筑业、渔业的主要原料和用品。黄麻、洋麻、?麻的纤维可做成包装和运输用的麻袋、麻包布和绳索。苎麻可织成我国特产的夏布和渔网。大麻纤维是制造高级卷烟纸的良好材料。亚麻可织成各种漂亮的衣料、窗帘、桌布，它的种子还可以榨油。罗布麻可与羊毛混纺成凡尔丁、华达昵等高级衣料。而各种麻的麻绒、麻屑、麻骨又是建筑业和轻工业的原料。由此看来，麻类作物是一项极重要的工业原料，不能丝毫忽视和轻视。
    今年各种麻类的播种面积和去年差不多，但国家和人民对麻类的需要却成倍地增长了。要解决这个矛盾，就必须大力提高单位面积产量。
    根据黄麻生长特点，在株高一尺以后即进入生长盛期，肥、水必须紧紧跟上，保证吃饱、喝足，才能生长良好。去年萧山县二十点五万亩黄麻，平均每亩获得六百九十八斤的高额产量，主要原因就是抓住了肥和水。由于黄麻是一种以获取茎秆为目的的纤维作物，在大量增施氮肥的基础上，结合增施一些钾肥，对增厚麻皮、增加抗旱、抗病虫力就会起良好作用。黄麻茎高大，需水多，必须加强麻田灌溉工作，充分利用一切水源和设备，力求做到适时灌溉，保持麻田经常湿润。
    今年苎麻的头麻生长比去年好。二麻即将收获，预计产量也高于去年。二麻收割后应立即施肥，促使三麻迅速生长。以往三麻产量往往只有头麻的30％。产量低的原因主要是有些地区对三麻重视不够，不施肥，不认真进行管理。其实，三麻的产量并不低，只要加强管理，产量会大大提高，去年湖北阳新县大同一社，苎麻亩产二千多斤，就是由于他们加强了每道麻的管理工作。只要我们大力作好三麻的田间管理，使之和头麻、二麻一样丰产，今年苎麻的总产量就可以大大超过去年。
    今年各地麻类病虫害比往年发生得早，必须早治，才能收到“事半功倍”之效。对农药应采取土洋并举方针，特别要充分发挥土农药作用。商业部门要根据病虫发生情况，对于灭虫药剂进行必要的调剂，使农药真正发挥它应有的作用。
    以追肥为中心的麻田管理，是今年麻类丰收的主要关键。各产麻区的农业部门和人民公社应抓住时机，领导广大社员把这个战役打好，以争取麻类作物的更大丰收。
