Accelerate the Production of Locomotives and Freight Cars
　　The Shenyang Locomotive Factory's Freight Car Output in July Exceeded the Average Monthly Output in the First Half of the Year by More Than Double
　　The Dalian Locomotive Factory Decided to Produce Twelve More Locomotives and Ninety-Three More Freight Cars in August
　　The Chengdu Locomotive Factory's Productivity in the First Seven Days of August Increased Twofold Compared to the Same Period in July
　　(Reported by this newspaper from Shenyang on the 10th) The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has adopted effective measures to rush-produce freight cars and vigorously support railway transportation. The monthly output of freight cars has increased month by month. In July, a new record of 200 freight cars was produced, exceeding the average monthly output in the first half of the year by more than double. Entering August, the workers have even greater enthusiasm and aim to manufacture forty more freight cars than in July.
　　All the workers in the factory clearly realize that producing a batch of freight cars earlier by a day can transport hundreds or thousands of tons of materials to places where they are urgently needed, vigorously supporting the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. They are doing everything possible to overcome difficulties and accelerate the speed of manufacturing freight cars. One of the difficulties in increasing the production of freight cars is the insufficient casting production capacity, especially the casting of cold steel wheels for freight cars. All the workers in the cold wheel section of the steel casting workshop found that the reason why the output could not be increased was the high number of defective cold steel wheel castings. After conducting a major quality inspection and launching a zero-defect movement, the yield rate of cold steel wheels increased by 3.64%, resulting in an increase of more than 260 cold steel wheels in July, enough for the production of more than 30 freight cars. In order to support the casting workshop and solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, the workers in the machining workshop tried every means to reduce work-in-progress, repair and revive defective and substandard products. Liu Wanchun, Zhao Yunfeng, and Yao Zhongxi, three workers in the axle box section of the bogie workshop, collected forty-eight discarded axle boxes. After being repaired, the quality was completely qualified, which not only reduced the burden on the casting workshop, but also saved more than 1,600 yuan in raw materials and labor costs.
　　At the beginning of August, the factory also held a series of cadre meetings to further mobilize all the workers in the factory to go all out and revise the August plan. The monthly production plan for freight cars was raised from the original 210 to 240. The revolutionary enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory is unprecedentedly high, and they have launched a new upsurge of the production increase and conservation movement throughout the factory. In the first half of July, only a dozen freight cars were assembled. From August 1st to 9th, forty freight cars have already been assembled.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Dalian-Lushun, 10th. In order to welcome the great tenth anniversary of the National Day, the workers of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory have decided to produce twelve more locomotives and ninety-three more freight cars in August than in July, first making outstanding achievements.
　　Recently, the Party committee of the factory held an enlarged meeting. By investigating ideology, work style, and enthusiasm, and citing a large number of facts, it was shown that due to some people's empty talk about difficulties and slow action, the greater achievements that could have been achieved were not attained in July. As a result, the entire factory, from top to bottom, examined and criticized right-leaning conservative sentiments and procrastination. Through detailed calculations and analysis of subjective and objective conditions, all workshops, departments, sections, groups, and even every worker in the factory realistically calculated the potential for increasing production and saving resources in their respective units and themselves, and proposed specific goals for increasing production and saving resources, determined to offer a generous gift for the tenth anniversary of the National Day.
　　This inspection encouraged the labor enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory. Representatives of the 750 red banner pacesetters and red banner units in the factory then held a mass meeting, advocating to the entire factory to launch competitions in the same types of work and business, focusing on quality, high output, conservation, equipment maintenance, safe production, and economic results. In order to specifically implement the leadership's intentions and the factory's tasks into every machine tool and every worker, cadres above the section chief level have selected key units and adopted methods such as following shifts, going to the site for mobile work, and participating in labor to specifically grasp the production units at the grassroots level - the groups, helping them exchange experiences, solve problems, and improve production. The factory also formulated practical technical measures to overcome difficulties in the supply of wheels and frames. Starting in July, the factory, under the responsibility of a deputy director, went deep into the casting workshop to study the problem of manufacturing wheels in the factory. At present, the factory can produce wheels in large quantities, basically guaranteeing the factory's needs. In terms of the main frame, in addition to seeking external assistance, the factory has also mobilized manpower and material resources to rush the construction of a new casting workshop.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 10th. The workers of the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory have gone all out, made great efforts in technical innovation, and achieved remarkable results in locomotive manufacturing and repair. In the first half of the year, seven new locomotives were built, more than double the same period last year. Thirty-four locomotives were overhauled and moderately repaired, double the second half of last year. The turnaround time for repairing a locomotive was shortened by ten days in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Nine locomotives were repaired and delivered in July, an increase of 50% compared to June. The productivity in the first seven days of August increased twofold compared to the same period in July. Based on the existing production level, the workers have proposed even higher goals for August: two new locomotives, eleven overhauled and moderately repaired locomotives, and eight new freight cars.
　　In February this year, the workers of the factory proposed 144 relatively practical and feasible specific measures to solve key problems such as materials, production capacity, and quality. For example, the foundry workshop implemented hard casting methods, which not only overcame the difficulties of poor sand removal and difficult machining of castings, but also improved work efficiency by three to seventeen times. Zhang Fangyou, a master mechanic in the locomotive workshop, boldly successfully trial-produced a simple copper mouth milling tool, which improved work efficiency by fifty-nine times. In the past six months, the factory has self-made raw materials such as pig iron, red bricks, refractory bricks, lime, and dolomite, with a value of more than 300,000 yuan. The workers have also saved a large amount of raw materials. They have also successively organized workers from various workshops to go to railway factories in Dalian, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Changxindian and other places to "learn from experience," and promoted 196 advanced experiences from these factories, such as "bilateral operation," "die forging," "one die for multiple forgings," and "special freight car dies." The factory often holds workshop technical performance meetings, where people observe and learn from each other, so that advanced experience can be quickly popularized. Therefore, the production level has improved rapidly.
　　In May, the factory launched a free discussion among workers, and based on the opinions of the masses, established and improved 38 necessary rules and regulations. (Attached picture)

　　加快生产机车货车
　　沈阳机车厂货车产量七月比上半年平均月产超过一倍
　　大连机车厂决定八月份多产机车十二台货车九十三辆
　　成都机车厂八月头七天比七月同期生产率提高了两倍
    本报沈阳10日电　沈阳机车车辆工厂采取有效措施，赶制货车大力支援铁路运输。货车月产量逐月上升，7月份创月产货车二百辆的新纪录，超过上半年平均月产量一倍多。进入8月职工们的干劲更大，要比7月份多制造四十辆货车。
    全厂职工都清楚地认识到，能早一天多生产一批货车，就能把成百上千吨物资运到急需的地方去，大力支援工农业生产继续跃进。他们千方百计地战胜困难，加快制造货车的速度。增产货车的困难之一，是铸造的生产能力不足，特别是货车冷钢轮的铸造。铸钢车间冷轮工段全体职工，找出产量不能提高的原因，是铸造的冷钢轮废品多。他们通过质量大检查，开展无废品运动之后，使冷钢轮的成品率提高了3.64％，7月份因而增产了二百六十多个冷钢轮，足够增产三十多辆货车用。为了支援铸工车间，同时解决原料不足的困难，加工车间的工人们，想尽办法压缩在制品，修理和复活废品和次品。转向架车间轴箱工段刘万春、赵云峰和姚忠喜三个人，收集了四十八个报废的轴箱，经过修理之后，质量完全合格，不仅减轻了铸造车间的负担，还节省价值一千六百多元的原料和人工费。
    这个工厂在8月初，又连续召开了干部会议，进一步发动全厂职工鼓足干劲，重新修订了8月份计划，月产货车计划，从原来的二百一十辆提高到二百四十辆。全厂职工的革命干劲空前高涨，他们掀起了遍及全厂的增产节约运动新高潮。7月上半月，装配出来的货车只有十几辆，8月1日到9日，已经装配出货车四十辆。
    新华社旅大10日电　大连机车车辆厂职工为了迎接伟大的国庆十周年，决定8月份比7月份多产十二台机车、九十三辆货车，首先作出优异的成绩。
    最近，这个厂的党委召开了扩大会议，通过查思想、查作风、查干劲，举出大量事实，说明由于部分人员空喊困难，行动迟缓，7月份未能取得可以有条件取得的更大成就。从而，全厂自上而下地检查批判了右倾保守情绪和拖拉作风，通过算细账、分析主观和客观条件，全厂各车间、科室、工段、小组直到每个职工，都切实计算了自己单位和本人的增产节约潜力，提出了增产节约的具体目标，决心向国庆十周年献一份厚礼。
    这次检查，鼓舞了全厂职工的劳动热情。全厂七百五十个红旗手和红旗单位的代表，紧接着举行了群众大会，向全厂倡议围绕着优质、高产、节约、设备维修、安全生产和经济效果，展开同工种同业务的竞赛。为了把领导意图和全厂任务具体贯彻到每台机床、每个工人中去，工段长以上干部都选择了重点单位，采取跟班、到现场流动办公、参加劳动等办法，具体抓基层的生产单位——小组，帮助他们交流经验，解决问题，提高生产。全厂还订出了切实的技术措施，克服车轮、车架供应上的困难。从7月开始，这个厂由一位副厂长负责，深入铸造车间，研究由本厂制造车轮的问题。目前，这个厂已可以大批生产车轮，基本上能保证本厂需要。在主车架方面，除争取外援外，厂里也已动员人力物力，赶建新铸造车间。
    据新华社成都10日电　成都机车车辆厂职工鼓足干劲，大闹技术革新，在机车制造和修理方面取得了显著成绩。上半年新造机车七台，比去年同期增加了一倍多，大修中修机车三十四台，比去年下半年增加一倍。修理一台机车的周转期，第二季度比第一季度缩短了十天。7月份修好出厂九台，比6月份提高50％，8月份开头七天比7月份同期的生产率又提高了两倍。职工们根据现有生产水平，又提出8月份新造机车两台、大修中修机车十一台、新造货车八辆的更高目标。
    这个工厂的职工在今年2月份曾就解决材料、生产能力、质量等关键问题，提出了一百四十四项比较切实可行的具体措施。如翻砂车间推行了硬铸造方法，既克服了铸件脱砂不良、不易加工的困难，又提高了工效三倍到十七倍。机车间张方佑老师傅大胆地试制成功简易铣铜口工具，提高了工效五十九倍。半年来，全厂自制生铁、红砖、耐火砖、石灰、白云石等原材料，价值达三十万多元，职工们又节约了大量原材料。他们又先后组织各车间职工去大连、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、长辛店等铁路工厂“取经”，推广了这些工厂的“双边作业”、“胎模锻造”、“一模多锻”、“货车专用胎模等”一百九十六项先进经验；全厂经常举行车间技术表演会，互相观摩学习，使先进经验很快得到推广。因此生产水平提高很快。
    厂里在5月份曾发动职工鸣放辩论，根据群众的意见，建立和健全了三十八项必要的规章制度。（附图片）
