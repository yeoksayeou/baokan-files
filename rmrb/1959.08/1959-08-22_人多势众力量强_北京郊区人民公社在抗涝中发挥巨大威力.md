Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: After several rounds of battling unprecedented torrential rains and floods, the people in the suburbs of Beijing have achieved a great victory. The people's communes have played an extremely powerful role in this struggle.

Following the extraordinarily heavy rain on August 6th, the Beijing area experienced continuous rainfall, increasing the flooding situation. In some areas, the total rainfall in the past month has reached over 1,000 millimeters. The millions of urban and rural people fighting on the front lines of flood control and replanting have overcome numerous difficulties with even greater enthusiasm. Despite the situation of draining and then being submerged, planting and then being washed away repeatedly, as of the 18th, over 1.8 million mu of accumulated water had been drained in the entire suburban area. Of the 420,000 mu planned for autumn vegetable planting, 89% of the planting task has been completed. The direct seeding and seedling cultivation of Chinese cabbage has also been basically completed, with a total of over 130,000 mu of direct-seeded cabbage. In addition, over 16,000 mu of Chinese cabbage seedlings have been cultivated, which can supply over 200,000 mu of vegetable fields for planting around the "Autumnal Equinox."

In the struggle against flooding and for replanting, the people's communes have demonstrated their great power. Although the people's communes in the suburbs were established less than a year ago, thanks to the comprehensive development of production and the significant increase in income, a solid material foundation has been laid for overcoming natural disasters. The bumper harvest of grain crops last autumn and the increased wheat production this year have ensured the material well-being of the communes, boosting the confidence of the members in overcoming nature. Daxing District is the most severely affected district in the suburbs, with 400,000 mu of its 930,000 mu of farmland severely flooded. In 1956, the area suffered a smaller flood than this year, but at that time, due to the small scale and weak resistance of the agricultural cooperatives, they relied primarily on relief funds and livelihood loans from the state bank for survival in the period after the disaster. This year is very different. Although the flooding is more severe, all members of the six communes in the district have enough to eat. For the few teams with difficult living conditions, the communes have uniformly adjusted the distribution of grain based on the principle of equivalent exchange. Currently, the communes in the suburbs are actively purchasing fertilizers and seeds from commercial departments, determined to make up for the losses caused by the torrential rains through further development of production. After communization, Guogongzhuang Brigade of Huangtugang Commune in Fengtai District added 70 sets of power machinery, and 70% of the cultivated land can be irrigated and drained by machinery. Because of its strong foundation and great strength, although many vegetable fields were destroyed by the flood this year, the members are still determined to expand the autumn vegetable area by another 2,000 mu to compensate for the flood losses.

Because the people's communes have a large population and strong momentum, they can plan work and arrange labor in a unified manner, launching large-scale flood prevention and control activities, thereby strengthening their disaster resistance and reducing flood losses. Many people's communes have organized cooperation between teams in the disaster relief struggle, and many production teams have also demonstrated a selfless spirit for the overall interest. Huangcun Commune in Daxing District was severely flooded, and the harvest of nearly 70% of the late autumn crops is hopeless. However, under the unified arrangement of the commune, autumn vegetables have been planted in time on the drained land. The members are also planning to catch fish and prepare to organize a part of the surplus labor force to carry out diversified operations, recouping the income lost due to the flood. After the flood occurred, Lugouqiao People's Commune, which was severely affected, immediately dispatched more than ten experienced old farmers with vegetable growing experience from Sanluju Brigade to guide vegetable growing in other teams, and also mutually adjusted over 5,000 jin of vegetable seeds within the commune, enabling the production teams to replant autumn vegetables in time. According to the principle of equivalent exchange, Xiaotun Brigade unified the labor force of the eleven production teams into three large armies, and concentrated its efforts to rush to clear land and plant vegetables in a planned and step-by-step manner, in the order of higher ground first, then lower ground, completing the planting task of over 2,800 mu of direct-seeded Chinese cabbage in four days. As of the 17th, the commune had replanted over 14,000 mu of various autumn vegetables. Nansinfang Brigade of Mentougou Commune is located in the mountainous area. In order to help the plain areas grow more autumn vegetables, they organized more than 200 members, bringing more than a dozen sets of draft animals, and went down the mountain to camp in the fields in villages more than 30 li away, planting over 400 mu of autumn vegetables. The Second Brigade of Changping Town in the Thirteenth Mausoleums Commune had a large task of planting Chinese cabbage, and the Fifth and Eighth Brigades sent the strongest labor and livestock to support them, enabling the Second Brigade to complete the vegetable planting task ahead of schedule.

At present, the threat of torrential rain in the suburbs of Beijing has not been lifted, and the land may be flooded at any time, but under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire suburban area are fighting hard with full confidence in the great strength of the people's communes. They say: People's communes have a large population and strong momentum; working together to develop production, we will surely transform a disaster year.

### 人多势众力量强  北京郊区人民公社在抗涝中发挥巨大威力

    人多势众力量强
    北京郊区人民公社在抗涝中发挥巨大威力
    新华社20日讯　北京郊区人民与百年未有的暴雨洪水大战了几个回合以后，已经取得伟大胜利。人民公社在这场斗争中发挥了极大的威力。
    继8月6日特大暴雨之后，北京地区又连续降雨，涝情有所增加，有的地区近一个多月来，降雨总量已达一千毫米以上。战斗在抗洪抢种前线的几百万城乡人民以更大的干劲克服了重重困难，在随泄随淹，屡种屡冲的情况下，截至18日止，全郊区已排除积水一百八十多万亩，计划播种的四十二万亩秋菜，已完成播种任务的89％，其中大白菜直播育苗工作也基本完成，直播白菜共达十三万多亩，另外育大白菜秧苗一万六千多亩，可供二十多万亩菜田在“处暑”前后栽种。
    在抗涝抢种斗争中，人民公社发挥了强大的威力。郊区的人民公社虽然诞生不到一年，由于生产全面发展，收入大大增加，为战胜自然灾害打下了雄厚的物质基础。去年秋天粮食作物大丰收，今年小麦又获得增产，公社的物质生活有了保证，社员不愁吃穿，增强了战胜自然的信心。大兴区是郊区受灾最重的一个区，全区九十三万亩农田，受到严重涝患的就有四十万亩。1956年这里也曾受到比今年较小的涝患，但当时因农业社规模小抗拒力较弱，受患后的一个时期内，主要是依靠国家银行的救济款、生活贷款度日。今年大不相同，虽然涝情更重，可是全区六个公社的社员人人都有饭吃，少数生活困难的队，也在等价交换的原则下，由公社统一调剂了粮食。现在郊区各公社正在积极向商业部门购买肥料、籽种，决定从进一步发展生产中，来弥补暴雨带来的损失。丰台区黄土岗公社郭公庄大队在公社化以后，添置了七十台动力机械，70％的耕地都可以用机械灌溉排水。因为家底厚，力量大，今年虽然被大水冲毁了很多菜田，但社员们仍决心把秋菜面积再扩大两千亩，弥补涝患损失。
    人民公社由于人多势众，可以统一筹划工作、安排劳力，展开了声势浩大的防涝抗涝活动，因而增强了抗灾力量，减少了涝患损失。很多人民公社在抗灾斗争中都组织了各队之间的协作；不少生产队为了整体利益还发扬了舍己为人的精神。大兴区的黄村公社受涝很重，将近70％的大秋作物收成无望，但是在公社统一安排下，现在已经在排除积水的土地上，及时种上了秋菜，社员们还在筹划捕鱼，准备组织一部分多余劳动力开展多种经营，把因为涝患损失的收益再夺回来。受患较重的芦沟桥人民公社在涝患发生后，立即从三路居大队抽出十多名有种菜经验的老农，到其他各队指导种菜，并在全社范围内互相调剂了菜种五千多斤，使各生产队及时补种了秋菜。小屯大队按照等价交换的原则，把全队十一个生产小队的劳动力统一组成三路大军，按照先高地、后洼地的顺序，集中力量有计划有步骤地突击腾地种菜，四天时间就完成了二千八百多亩直播大白菜的种植任务。截至17日，全社已抢种各种秋菜一万四千多亩。门头沟公社南辛房大队地处山区，他们为了帮助平原地区多种秋菜，组织了二百多名社员，带着十几套耕畜，下山到三十多里以外的村庄扎营田头，播种了四百多亩秋菜。十三陵公社昌平镇第二大队，种白菜任务大，第五、第八两个大队就派最强壮的劳力、牲畜去支援，使第二大队的种菜任务提前完成。
    目前，北京郊区的暴雨威胁仍未解除，土地随时可能被淹，但全郊区人民在党的领导下，正在满怀信心地依靠人民公社的伟大力量，努力奋斗。他们说：人民公社人多势众力量强；同心协力闹生产，定能把灾年变个样。
