    A Female Pilot's Account of an Airdrop
    Liu Wojun
    In the evening, shortly after arriving in the Guangzhou area, female pilots Shi Lixia, Lin Shuyu, and Xue Wenshu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force received orders from their superiors: Immediately airdrop supplies to flood-stricken areas.
    Performing this task was an honor. However, the natural conditions were very unfavorable: low cloud cover, high wind speeds; unstable airflow at low altitudes; and the particularly severe flooding made it difficult to find the targets, presenting many difficulties. But no difficulty could stop the people's soldiers. Xue Wenshu, a twenty-two-year-old Communist Party member, said excitedly, "We are the people's soldiers, and the people's disaster is our disaster. We must complete the airdrop mission."
    Early in the morning, dark clouds covered the sky, and the low pressure made the air so stuffy that people were sweating profusely. The pilot Shi Lixia, navigator Lin Shuyu, and co-pilot Xue Wenshu, carrying navigation charts and flight caps, and other flight personnel, stepped into two planes.
    "No matter what kind of clouds, we must break through them!" Facing the thick clouds leading to the skies above the disaster area, Shi Lixia, who had eight years of flying experience, said fiercely.
    As the plane roared into the sky at an altitude of three hundred meters, Shi Lixia looked out through the cockpit glass, seeing only a hazy mist. Gusts of headwind constantly attacked the fuselage, causing it to shake and bump. The mountains to the left, right, and below the plane constantly threatened its safety. Suddenly, the fuselage shuddered; it turned out they had encountered heavy rain. Single-mindedly focused on flying to the disaster area, Shi Lixia concentrated all her attention, using her skilled techniques and relying on the instrument readings, to continue forward. Navigator Lin Shuyu stood nervously behind her to the right, guiding the direction.
    Seven minutes later, a bright light suddenly flashed across their cockpit, and the plane broke through the clouds. Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu's anxious eyes immediately turned to the ground. The raging flood had swallowed villages and rice paddies. In that instant, Shi Lixia lowered the plane from an altitude of three hundred meters, through the clouds, to one hundred and fifty meters. Ah, she saw it clearly! The crowds on the hilltops, buildings, and roads above the water were the compatriots affected by the disaster, the villagers who nurtured our army with their hard work! Shi Lixia gripped the control stick even tighter, stepped on the rudder even more steadily, and following the course indicated by Lin Shuyu, the plane obediently headed toward the first airdrop point – the eastern mountains of Boluo County. Shi Lixia held her breath and accurately made an entry maneuver. Lin Shuyu quickly pressed the electric bell, and the bags of roasted rice dropped by the airdrop crew landed accurately on the hillside.
    They completed the airdrop mission to more than ten airdrop points in an hour and a half. On this day, they flew five sorties continuously in complex weather conditions, flying at low altitude for nearly eight hours, and the accuracy rate of the airdrops reached 100%.
    Co-pilot Xue Wenshu, who had only entered aviation school two years ago, carried out the same battle in another plane. Under the command of the pilot, she bravely and calmly flew the plane. This young Communist Party member, with only a little over a hundred hours of flying experience, was motivated by a sense of responsibility to rescue the victims, prompting her to complete the mission outstandingly. Her pilot, Xu Shao-san, praised her as a good pilot.
    On the third day of the airdrops, the weather turned clear, but the climate became increasingly hot. At noon, when Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu entered the airtight cabin, the temperature gauge was pointing to "forty degrees." This time, they accepted a new mission: to find a disaster relief point south of Tonghu that had not yet been airdropped. According to reports from relevant parties, the victims there had not had anything to eat for several days. They were very anxious and wished they could find it immediately. It was very hot and stuffy in the plane. Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu's flight suits were soaked with sweat, but they still focused on flying and searching for the target. Suddenly, Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu almost simultaneously spotted a few wisps of smoke rising near Tonghu in Huiyang County, but they couldn't see where the people were. Shi Lixia immediately directed the plane to reduce altitude and circled twice over the location where the smoke was rising, finally seeing a large group of people gathered on a hilltop resembling a small island. But this was different from the location reported by the ground. "Saving people is the most important thing!" They quickly and accurately dropped the supplies there. It was later confirmed that the ground report was wrong due to a communication breakdown. They had airdropped supplies to the group of disaster victims who were in urgent need of rescue.
    The plane only had the last three packages of supplies left, but they discovered hundreds of disaster victims on a section of highway not far away. However, they could not find the airdrop contact marker, and the ground command had not explained the situation here. What to do? They stared downward; the disaster victims were waving their clothes at the plane, how much they needed assistance! Seeing this scene, Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu were very moved. They exchanged views simply with the others on the plane, believing that they were likely to be undiscovered disaster victims and should be airdropped to quickly. But another problem arose: the road was very narrow, surrounded by water, and there were so many people that the supplies were likely to fall into the water or injure the disaster victims. At this time, the captain Shi Lixia quickly and calmly directed the plane to reduce speed as much as possible and descend, using her years of flying experience. When the plane was aligned with the target and descended to a low altitude of about fifty meters, the waving and cheering of the disaster victims below could be seen clearly. The "ring-ring" airdrop signal sounded, and the last three packages of supplies were thrown out of the cabin, accurately landing on the slope of the highway. At this time, everyone on the plane smiled with tears in their eyes, and the stuffiness in the cabin seemed to have diminished.
    After the plane landed, the leaders of the air force stationed in Guangzhou happily said, "The female pilots should be greatly commended!" Xue Wenshu couldn't restrain the excitement in her heart and said, "We just did what we should do!" She remembered that after airdropping supplies and letters from the provincial leadership calling on the disaster victims to work together to fight the flood on the first day, the next day on the plane she saw that some of the hilltops where grain had been airdropped had white slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Long live the Communist Party." Her eyes turned red: "The people love our Party and leader so much, they believe that as long as they are under the leadership of the Party, they can overcome all difficulties!"

    女飞行员空投记
    刘沃钧
    傍晚，刚到广州地区不久的中国人民解放军空军女飞行员施丽霞、林淑玉和薛文淑接到上级命令：立即给受水灾地区空投物资。
    执行这个任务是光荣的。可是自然条件很不利：云层低、风速大；低空飞行，气流不稳定；洪水特大，目标不容易找到，真是困难重重。但是任何困难，也阻挡不住人民战士。二十二岁的共产党员薛文淑激动地说：“我们是人民的子弟兵，人民的灾难就是我们的灾难。我们一定要完成空投任务。”
    清晨，乌云盖满天空，低气压使人气闷得直流汗。机长施丽霞、领航员林淑玉和副驾驶员薛文淑，提着航行图和飞行帽，和其他空勤人员跨进了两架飞机。
    “不管什么样的云都要冲出去！”面对着通往受灾区上空的浓云，有着八年飞行经验的施丽霞发狠地说。
    当飞机吼叫着进入三百米的上空时，施丽霞透过座舱玻璃向外望去，只见一片蒙蒙的云雾。一股股逆气流不断向机身袭来，使机身颠簸不定。在飞机左右和下方的群山，时时威胁着飞机的安全。突然机身一阵震抖，原来碰上急雨了。一心飞往灾区的施丽霞全神贯注，以她熟练的技术，凭借着仪表的指示，继续前进。领航员林淑玉紧张地站立在她右后方，指引着方向。
    七分钟后，光亮骤然掠过她们的座舱，飞机越出云层了。施丽霞和林淑玉焦急的眼光，立即投向地面。凶猛的洪水吞没了村庄和稻田。就在这一刹那间，施丽霞将飞机由三百米高度、穿过云层下降到一百五十米。呵，看清楚了！在那高出水面的山头上、楼房上、公路上的人群，便是受灾的同胞，是用辛勤劳动哺育我们军队的乡亲！施丽霞手中的驾驶杆握得更紧了，舵踩得更稳了，随着林淑玉指给的航向，飞机驯服地开向第一个空投点——博罗县的东边山上。施丽霞屏住气，准确地做了个进入动作，林淑玉眼明手快地一按电铃，空投员抛出的炒米袋便准确地落到那个山坡上。
    她们一个半小时完成了十多个空投点的空投任务。这一天，她们在复杂气象条件下，连续低空飞行了五架次，将近八个小时，空投的命中率达到了百分之百。
    两年前才进航校的副驾驶员薛文淑，在另一架飞机上进行了同样的战斗。她在机长的指挥下，勇敢而沉着地驾驶着飞机。这位年轻的共产党员只有一百多小时的飞行经历，抢救灾民的责任感，促使她出色地完成了任务。她的机长徐绍三称赞她是个好样的飞行员。
    空投到第三天，天转晴，可是气候愈来愈热了。中午时分，施丽霞、林淑玉进入密不通风的机舱时，气温表正指着“四十度”。这次起飞，她们接受了一个新的任务：寻找铜湖南边一个尚未空投过的灾民点。根据有关方面的报告，那里的灾民已经有几天没有吃上东西了。她们非常焦急，恨不得马上就能找到它。飞机上闷热得很，施丽霞和林淑玉的飞行服都湿透了，但是她们仍然专心地边飞边搜索目标。突然，施丽霞和林淑玉差不多同时发现几缕青烟，在惠阳县的铜湖附近升起，可是看不清人在哪里。施丽霞立即指挥飞机降低高度，在发出青烟的地点上空连绕了两个圈子，终于看到一个像小孤岛似的山头上，聚着一大群人。但是这和地面报告的位置可不同。“救人要紧！”她们就迅速而准确地在那儿投下了物资。事后证实，由于联络中断，地面的报告错了。她们空投的正是那批急待抢救的灾民。
    飞机只剩下最后三包物资了，可是她们又发现在不远的一段公路上，有好几百个灾民。不过，她们找不到空投联络的标记，地面指挥也没交代过这里的情况。怎么办呢？她们睁大了眼睛向下望；灾民们对着飞机挥舞着衣服，他们多么需要援救啊！看到这种情景，施丽霞、林淑玉心中非常激动，她们和同机的几个人简单交换了意见，认为很可能是尚未发现的灾民，应当赶快空投。但是问题又来了：公路很窄，四周是水，人又多，物资很可能投到水里，或者砸坏了灾民。这时机长施丽霞以她多年的飞行经验，很快就沉着地指挥飞机尽量减低速度下降。当飞机对准目标下降到五十米左右低空的时候，下面灾民招手和欢呼的动作已看得清清楚楚。“铃——铃”的空投信号响了，最后三包物资抛出机舱，不偏不倚，刚刚投到公路的斜坡上。这时候，机上的人都噙着泪花笑出了声响，舱里的闷热似乎也减退了。
    飞机着陆后，驻广州空军部队的首长高兴地说：“要大大表扬女飞行员！”薛文淑按捺不住心头的激动说：我们只是做了应该做的事情啊！她记得第一天空投了物资和省领导机关号召灾民齐心抗洪的信件后，第二天在飞机上便看到，有些空投过粮食的山头上，出现了白色的标语：“毛主席万岁”、“共产党万岁”。她的眼圈红了：“人民多么热爱我们的党和领袖，他们相信只要在党的领导下，就能够战胜一切困难！”
