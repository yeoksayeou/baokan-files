　　“Wishing You Luck”
　　——Gambling and Politics
　　By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
　　Recently, I watched a horse race.
　　In Britain, horse racing is not merely entertainment, and football matches are not just sports. They are all forms of gambling – legal gambling – that attract millions of participants.
　　The racecourse is in Epsom, a southern suburb of London. Two miles before reaching it, I was being enthusiastically greeted by a middle-aged man waiting by the roadside. He handed me a thin booklet with horses' names and blank forms printed on it. Then, he spoke a lot of slang. This is a "broker" soliciting gambling business.
　　The racecourse is in a vast hollow. From afar, it looked like an ant nest with the lid just lifted, teeming with activity. The atmosphere here was special: excitement, frenzy, and the worship and pursuit of money. The stands were completely full. The best seats sold for four pounds each. They were all occupied by gentlemen in tailcoats and top hats, wearing binoculars, waiting for their own horses to appear. Ordinary Britons surrounded the oval track, packed tightly, crowding, shouting, cursing, and wishing each other luck. In the center of the racecourse, a huge billboard stood with several eye-catching characters written in blood red: "Wishing You Luck!"
　　Suddenly, a thunderous cheer erupted. Countless arms and hats waved in the air. Dozens of horses were galloping past. A race had ended. Then, the hundreds of gambling stalls scattered around the field became the center of activity. They were simple, with just a wooden board and a small box for storing banknotes. The boards displayed the names of the horses and enticing numbers such as "1 to 16" and "1 to 20". People, based on their experience and the clues provided by the newspapers, placed bets on a horse in the next race, then waited for "luck" to descend. These small stalls are agents of gambling companies. There are eight monopolistic large gambling companies in Britain, and "Littlewoods" alone employs 12,000 staff. It’s a new and booming business.
　　On the racecourse, the air was hot, and a rapid melody revolved. At each corner of the stands, a person in a red shirt and white gloves stood. He quickly moved his arms up, down, left, and right, signaling to the distance. The "market" for gambling was constantly changing: a horse originally at "1 to 20" might rise to "1 to 25" or fall to "1 to 15" in ten minutes.
　　News vendors lined up like athletes preparing for a race, poised to scramble for the newspapers delivered by car. British newspapers are generous with space when reporting on horse racing, dog racing, and football matches. The "Daily Mirror" and the "Daily Express" often devote two entire pages to it. Adding up the space used by all British newspapers in this regard, the weekly area reaches three thousand acres, enough to cover one and a half Hyde Parks.
　　In Britain, 6.5 million people participate in horse race gambling each year, 32.2 million in dog racing, and 14.4 million in football betting. The total is more than 50 million, while the population of Britain is only just over 50 million. This does not include other various forms of gambling. For example, gentlemen play roulette in nightclubs, and ordinary Britons play gambling machines in bars. This machine is very similar to a vending machine, but it sells a special commodity instead of cigarettes or chocolate: "luck". People only need to insert two shillings, then shake the handle or press a button, and with a clang – if "luck" has been bought – a handful of silver coins roll out. Some village clubs organize large-scale gambling on weekends, like holding a dance. They issue small pieces of paper similar to lottery tickets, six pence each, and the winner can get four pounds.
　　"Gambling has become our true religion," a British man said with infinite emotion. "In the Middle Ages, people yearned for heaven; now, every week they are immersed in a wonderful dream – to get seventy-five thousand pounds for nothing!"
　　Seventy-five thousand pounds is the highest amount that can be won by betting on football matches. However, someone has calculated that the chance of getting this amount of money is equal to picking one person from nearly half the world's population. How slim the hope is! Yet, people always want to try their "luck." In Britain, "Old Moore's Almanack" has been published since 1699, one edition per year, and it continues to be published to this day. This is a book that guides people to find "luck", with a Western version of the "Tui Bei Tu," and in recent years a special column for predicting football matches has been added. It sells three million copies a year, with an average of one copy for every five families.
　　Since there are thousands of people participating in gambling, there must be huge and meticulous organization. I have a copy of the "Sporting Life" newspaper. On this 24-page newspaper, the most striking thing, besides the words "Wishing You Luck" on the masthead, is the advertisement of a gambling company that takes up half a page. It reads: "The Epsom Race Week has already begun. Customers are welcome to bet by phone, telegram, or mail!"
　　There is no service more attentive than this. You only need to dial a phone number or drop a form into the mailbox. This form is simple, requiring only a few crosses or circles to indicate which horse or team you are betting on. Then, at five o'clock in the afternoon, you can find out the results of the day's football game and horse races on television or radio. If you win, the gambling company will remit the money to you; if you lose, you also remit the money afterwards. This practice is called "credit gambling." It is simple and easy, making the gambling wind strong.
　　Calling requires going through the phone company; sending letters and remittances requires going through the post office. In this way, the government is directly involved in the organization of gambling. An official report said: 10% of the letters handled by the British Post Office are football match "betting slips"; 60% of the postal remittances are "gambling money."
　　The enthusiasm of the government authorities is not without reason. From football match gambling alone, it receives 25 million pounds annually in the form of taxes. This has become a foolproof fixed income in the British fiscal budget. But the biggest benefit it gets is by no means financial. Gambling keeps millions of Britons – ordinary Britons – from thinking about serious political issues. The British government once established a "Royal Commission to Investigate Gambling" to study the increasingly rampant gambling wind. The conclusion of this committee was: "According to the current investigation, gambling cannot be considered to cause serious tension on the country's manpower and financial resources. We do not think it should be prohibited."

### “祝您幸运”——赌博和政治

　　“祝您幸运”
　　——赌博和政治
　　本报记者　潘非
    最近，我看了一次赛马。
    在英国，赛马并不是娱乐，足球比赛也不仅是体育。它们都是吸引着成千上万人参加的赌博——合法的赌博。
    赛马场在伦敦南郊的爱泼逊。离它还有二里地，我就被等待在路旁的一个中年男子殷勤地招呼着。他顺手递给我一本薄薄的小册子，上面印着一些马的名字和空白的表格。接着，他就说了许多黑话。这就是招揽赌博生意的“掮客”。
    赛马场在一个广阔的洼地里。远远望去，但见万头钻动，好像个刚揭了盖的蚂蚁窝。这儿沸腾着一种特殊的气氛：兴奋、狂热，对金钱的崇拜和追求。几个看台，已经全部客满。最好的看台，一个座位卖到四个英镑。坐在那儿的全是穿燕尾服、戴大礼帽的绅士。他们胸前佩着望远镜，等待着自己喂养的马匹出场。英国的普通人，围绕着椭圆形的跑道，排得密密地。他们拥挤着，叫嚷着，诅咒着，互相祝福着。在赛马场的中央，竖立着一块巨大的广告牌，上面用血红的颜色，写着几个触目的大字：“祝您幸运！”
    突然间，响起了一阵雷动的欢呼。无数双手臂，无数个帽子，在空中挥舞。原来，几十匹骏马正疾驰而过。一场比赛结束了。这时，散布在场地四周的成百个赌博摊子，便成为活动的中心。它们简单得只有一块木板和一只存放钞票的小箱子。木板上写着马的名字，和“一配十六”、
  “一配二十”等诱人的数字。人们根据自己的经验，根据报纸所提供的线索，把赌注押在下一场比赛中的某一匹马身上，然后，等待着“幸运”的降临。这些小摊子，都是赌博公司的经纪人。英国共有八个垄断性的大赌博公司，其中仅“小华尔华斯”一家，就雇佣了一万二千名职员。这是一行新起的兴隆生意。
    在赛马场上，激荡着灼热的空气，回转着急促的旋律。每个看台的角上，都站着个穿红上衣、戴白手套的人。他迅速地上下左右挥动或伸屈着手臂，向远处打着信号。赌博的“行情”在不断变化：某一匹马原是“一配二十”，十分钟后，也许上升到“一配二十五”或者下跌到“一配十五”。
    报贩们排着队，像准备赛跑的运动员一样，摆好一副争先恐后的姿势，等着由汽车运来的报纸。英国报纸在刊登赛马、赛狗、足球比赛等报道时，毫不吝啬版面。“每日镜报”和“每日快报”都经常占用两整版。把英国所有的报纸使用在这方面的篇幅合计起来，每星期的面积达三千亩。它可以复盖一个半海德公园。
    在英国，每年参加赛马这一门赌博的，有六百五十万人次。赛狗——三千二百万人次。足球——一千四百万人次。总计是五千多万人次，而英国的人口也只不过五千多万。这还没有把其他形形色色的赌博计算在内。例如，绅士们在夜总会里玩“轮盘赌”，普通的英国人在酒吧间里玩赌博机器。这种机器，很像一架自动售货机，不过它出卖的不是纸烟或巧克力，而是一种特殊的商品：“幸运”。人们只需塞进两个先令，然后摇一下把手或按一按钢钮，当啷一声——如果“幸运”被你买到了的话——滚出了一把银币。一些村镇的俱乐部，像举行舞会一样，在周末组织大规模的赌博。它发行一种类似彩票一样的小纸片，六个铜板一张，中彩的人可以得到四个英镑。
    “赌博，已成为我们真正的宗教，”一个英国人无限感叹地说。“在中世纪，人们向往着天国；现在，他们每星期都沉浸在美妙的梦幻中——平白地得到七万五千英镑！”
    七万五千英镑，这是赌足球比赛可以赢得的最高数字。但是，有人计算过，得到这一笔钱的机会，等于在将近世界人口的半数中挑选一个人。希望是多么渺茫呵！然而，人们总想碰一碰“运气”。在英国，从1699年起，就出版着一本“老摩尔年历”，每年一版，一直发行到现在。这是本指导人们去寻找“幸运”的书籍，里面有西洋的“推背图”，近年来又增加了对足球比赛预测的专栏。它年销售三百万册，平均每五个家庭备置一本。
    既然有成千上万的人参加赌博，势必要有巨大和周密的组织工作。在我手头有份“体育生活报”。在这份共有二十四页的报纸上，最引人注目的，除了报头上“祝您幸运”几个大字外，就是占了半版的一个赌博公司的广告。它写道：“在爱泼逊的赛马周业已开始。请顾客利用电话、电报或邮寄办法，快来赌钱！”
    没有比这服务得更周到的了。你只需拨一下电话，或者向邮筒里投下一张表格，就可以了。这种表格简单得只需打几个叉叉或画几个圈圈，表示你的赌注押在哪匹马上，或者是哪个球队上。然后，在下午五点钟，你可以从电视机或收音机上知道当天球赛和跑马的结果。赢了，赌博公司把钱汇给你；输了，你也在事后把钱汇过去。这种做法，叫做“信贷方式的赌博”。它简便易行，使赌风大炽。
    打电话要经过电话公司；寄信和汇款要经过邮局。这样，政府就直接参与了赌博的组织工作。一份官方的报告说：英国邮局处理的信件中，有10％是足球比赛的“赌表”；在邮局汇款中，有60％是“赌金”。
    政府当局的热诚，不是没有来由的。仅仅从足球比赛的赌博中，它每年以税收的方式获得二千五百万英镑。这已成为英国财政预算中一项百无一失的固定收入。但是，它所得到的最大的好处，决不是财政上的。赌博，使千百万的英国人——普通的英国人，不去思考严肃的政治问题。英国政府曾经成立过一个“调查赌博的皇家委员会”，对日益旺炽的赌风作了一番研究。这个委员会的结论是：“根据目前调查，不能认为赌博对国家人力财力造成严重紧张。我们不认为应予禁止。”
