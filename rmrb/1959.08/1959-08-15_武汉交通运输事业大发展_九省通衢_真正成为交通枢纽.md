Wuhan's Transportation Industry Experiences Great Development
"Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces" Truly Becomes a Transportation Hub

    (Our report) Since the completion and opening of the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan, and especially since the Great Leap Forward in national industry and agriculture last year, Wuhan has increasingly demonstrated its role as a transportation hub. To further meet the needs of the country's socialist construction, Wuhan is constructing a number of major transportation projects.

    Historically, Wuhan has been known as the "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces," but transportation was not very smooth before liberation. Due to long-term warlord separatism and wars, the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways and the Yangtze and Han rivers had very limited traffic capacity. The dilapidated Wuhan port terminals, controlled and monopolized by feudal headmen, lacked loading and unloading equipment suitable for large quantities of transshipment goods. Yangtze River transportation had to be divided into upper, middle, and lower reaches for transport, making transshipment work cumbersome and slow. Railway transportation also could not directly reach north and south.

    In the few years since liberation, the transportation landscape in the Wuhan area has greatly changed. More than 40% of the loading and unloading operations at Wuhan port terminals have been mechanized. The port's handling capacity has expanded year by year. Last year, the port's total throughput was equivalent to the total throughput of the port in the five years before liberation.

    The smooth flow of railways has greatly increased vehicle traffic capacity. Especially after the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge, linking the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou lines, railway transportation in the Wuhan area has become more active. Previously, vehicles traveling north and south had to rely on ferries, with a very small daily throughput capacity. Now, after the Yangtze River Bridge, the river-crossing capacity has increased about sevenfold.

    Wuhan is also a highway transportation center and an important air station. In addition to connecting other cities and vast rural areas via highways, it can directly and indirectly connect with more than sixty cities in the air.

    To meet the needs of the developing construction situation, a new transportation construction plan is being accelerated. These include the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway double-tracking project and the new Handan Railway construction project. In the future, railways will also be built from Wuhan to Jiangxi and other places. Correspondingly, Wuhan is building new port operation areas and a large-scale railway hub station.

    Wuhan's new port operation area is being built in Hanyang, which is a modern port area built to accommodate the opening of the Beijing-Guangzhou double-track railway and the increase in Yangtze River material transportation. Once this port area is fully completed, the annual throughput of Wuhan Port will more than double.

    The new railway hub stations are being built in Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou. The first phase of the project was basically completed last year, with the completion of a new Jiang'an marshalling station with eighteen tracks. This station is already serving the marshalling of incoming and outgoing vehicles and will be further expanded. In the future, a mechanized hump marshalling yard will be built in Yujiawan, Wuchang, which will speed up shunting efficiency. (Attached picture)

### 武汉交通运输事业大发展　“九省通衢”真正成为交通枢纽

　　武汉交通运输事业大发展
　　“九省通衢”真正成为交通枢纽
    本报讯　武汉市自从长江大桥建成通车以后，特别是去年全国工农业大跃进以来，愈来愈加显示出它的交通枢纽的作用。为了进一步适应国家社会主义建设事业的需要，武汉市又在建设一些重大的交通运输工程。
    武汉在历史上虽有“九省通衢”之称，但是在解放以前交通并不十分畅达。由于长期的军阀割据和战乱，京汉、粤汉两条铁路和长江、汉水，车船通过能力很小；被封建把头割据把持的破烂不堪的武汉港码头，没有适合大宗转口物资的装卸设备；长江运输要分上、中、下游三段运送，转运工作既繁琐又缓慢；铁路运输也不能南北直达。
    解放几年来，武汉地区的交通运输面貌大大改观。武汉港口码头的装卸作业，40％以上实现了机械化。港口吞吐能力逐年扩大，去年全港吞吐量相当于解放前五年港口吞吐量的总和。
    铁路的畅通，使车辆通过能力大大提高；特别是在长江大桥建成，京汉、粤汉两线携手之后，武汉地区的铁路运输更为活跃。以前，南来北往的车辆要靠轮渡运送，每天通过能力很小，现在经过长江大桥，渡江能力提高七倍左右。
    武汉还是一个公路交通中心和重要的航空站。除了通过公路联系其它城市和广大农村外，在空中已能直接间接和六十多个城市相通。
    为了适应建设形势发展的需要，一个新的交通建设计划，正在加紧实施。其中有京广铁路复线工程、汉丹铁路新建工程；将来还要建设从武汉至江西等地的铁路。同这相适应，武汉正在建设新的港口作业区和规模巨大的铁路枢纽站。
    武汉新的港口作业区建在汉阳，这是为适应京广线双轨通车和长江物资运输增长而建设的一个现代化的港区。这个港区全部建成以后，武汉港口每年吞吐量将再增加一倍多。
    新的铁路枢纽站分别在武昌、汉阳、汉口三处建设。第一期工程已经在去年基本完成，建成了一个十八股道的新江岸编组站。这个站已经在为来往的车辆编组服务，并要进一步扩建。将来还要在武昌余家湾新建一座机械化的驼峰编组场调车效率将会更快。（附图片）
