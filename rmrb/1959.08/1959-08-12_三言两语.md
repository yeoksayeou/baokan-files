    △Why is the sea always so turbulent, with towering waves? It's because, although it's vast, it doesn't reject any small streams; although it's "rich," it's not stingy at all, always using the sun and wind to send water vapor to the mountains, plateaus, and fertile fields.
    △The reason why the cloud pine's trunk is so tall and strong, and its branches and leaves so lush and dense, is because it has many leaves, allowing it to obtain more light and heat from the sun; its roots are deep, allowing it to obtain more moisture and nutrients from the soil.
    △A ship can only move forward by riding the wind and waves. A person can only survive by overcoming difficulties.
    △"A lamp won't shine unless you trim it." A lamp without oil is useless, no matter how much you trim it. "Add oil!" "Add oil!" At the sports field, people encourage athletes in this way, and it seems there's a lot of truth to it.
    △"You have to jump to pick the fruit," this refers to lower fruit trees. To pick fruit from higher fruit trees, you must also find a way to climb the tree.
    △People love to use "a journey of ten thousand li" to describe a bright future. However, a bright future must be achieved step by step, in a down-to-earth manner. Those unwilling to lift their feet and take action have no future at all.

　　三言两语
　　孙平
    △大海，为什么老是那样汹涌澎湃，波浪滔天？因为它虽然大，却不择细流；虽然“富有”，郤毫不吝啬，总是借助于太阳和风力，把水气送往大山、高原和沃野。
    △云松的躯干之所以高大壮实，枝叶之所以繁盛茂密，是因为它的叶子多，从太阳那里，能够得到更多的光和热；根子深，从泥土那里，能够得到更多的水分和养料。
    △船，能够乘风破浪，才能前进。人，能够克服困难，才能生存。
    △“灯不拨不亮”。没有油的灯，再拨也无益。“加油！”“加油！”在运动场上，人们不约而同地这样鼓励运动员，看来，很有道理。
    △“跳一跳，才能摘下果子来”，这是指低一点的果树而言的。要从高一点的果树上摘下果子来，还必须想办法上树去。
    △人们都爱以鹏程万里形容远大的前途。但是，远大的前途必须一步一步踏踏实实地走，不愿意抬脚动步的人，一点前途也没有。
