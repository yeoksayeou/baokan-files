Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 5th (by our reporter Lin Tian): The broad masses of peasants in the Shannan area are currently engaged in the democratic reform movement while simultaneously focusing on production, improving field management, and striving for a bumper harvest this year.

    Following the passage of the resolution on carrying out democratic reforms at the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, peasant associations at the county level and equivalent to district and township levels have been established in Shannan. These peasant associations are leading the peasants in an orderly manner to carry out the "Three Antis and Two Reductions" movement (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvée labor system, and anti-slavery, and reduction of rent and interest), while also organizing emancipated peasants to repair canals, weed fields, and strengthen field management. In the central area of Tsedang in Shannan, over ten thousand ke of land rely on a large canal for irrigation. Due to years of disrepair, this canal would flood some land every rainy season in the past. Although the serfs would carry out temporary repairs, they were mostly ineffective. This year, soon after the establishment of the peasant association, it called on everyone to repair the canal. Male and female emancipated peasants, carrying red flags and beating drums, happily rushed to repair the canal. After six days of hard work, they completely renovated the most dilapidated section of the hundred-li canal downstream. People carried stone slabs and rocks from the high mountains two li away, leveling and compacting the canal banks and beds. Those transporting stones formed long lines, with joyous labor songs rising and falling. Jianzan, the director of the Tsedang Peasant Association, said: "We have never labored so happily before, because today everyone knows that labor is for ourselves."

    The peasant association of Naidong Village in Naidong County, having discovered too much grass in the fields, called on all the villagers to weed the fields. In four days, they cleared the grass from nearly two or three thousand ke of highland barley fields. These days, Langsheng (household slaves) and "Ula" (those subject to Ula corvée labor), who had just been liberated and settled down in Naidong Village, also went to cut grass at the call of the peasant association. They drove groups of donkeys to carry the green grass back, and then dried it. Cidan Lamu, a woman from a family that had been Langsheng for generations, told the reporter while drying the grass: This grass is being stored for feeding draught cattle next spring.

    In the "Rong" area of Sangri County, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, the peasants of various villages, under the leadership of the peasant association, jointly repaired a large canal. In previous years, when canals were repaired in the summer, the Zongben (county head) and monastery stewards would issue orders, and foremen would use whips to drive people to repair them. Even after many days of repair, the canals were still not fixed properly, and some fields would dry up due to lack of water. This year, the peasants were repairing the canal for themselves, and it was fixed in just one day.

    Now, in the Shannan area along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, the highland barley has grown full ears, and the rapeseed and peas have formed pods. In some places in the deep valleys of the Himalayas, the first crop of highland barley has already been harvested, and buckwheat has been planted. In Lang County in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, apples, peaches, walnuts, and other fruits are laden with fruit, and grapes have formed clusters. After their hard work, the broad masses of emancipated peasants in Shannan will reap abundant fruits of their labor.

### 在民主改革运动中加强田间管理  山南翻身农民力争丰收

    在民主改革运动中加强田间管理
    山南翻身农民力争丰收
    新华社拉萨5日电　本社记者林田报道：山南地区广大农民，正一面开展民主改革运动，一面抓紧生产，做好田间管理，争取今年获得丰收。
    西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议通过关于进行民主改革的决议以后，山南各县和相当于区、乡一级的农民协会纷纷成立。这些农民协会一面领导农民有秩序地展开“三反双减”（反叛乱、反乌拉差役制度、反奴役和减租、减息）运动，一面组织翻身农民修渠、拔草，加强田间管理。山南的中心泽当一带，上万克土地靠一条大渠灌溉。这条大渠因为年久失修，往年每到雨季，总要淹没一些土地，农奴们临时抢修一下，也多半无济于事。今年农民协会成立不久就号召大家修渠，男女翻身农民，举着红旗，擂着大鼓兴高采烈地赶来修渠，大干了六天，就把这条百里大渠下游最破的一段，彻底翻修好了。人们从二里路外的高山上背来石板、石块，把渠堤渠干全部铺平打实。运石的人们排成长阵，欢乐的劳动歌声此起彼落。泽当的农民协会主任坚赞说：“我们从来没有这样高兴地劳动过，因为今天大家都知道，劳动是为我们自己了。”
    乃东县乃东村的农民协会，发现田里草多了，就号召全村农民到田里拔草，四天中拔干净了附近两三千克青稞田里的草。这些天，乃东村刚刚获得解放安了家的郎生
  （家奴）、“乌拉”（指支乌拉差役的人），也在农会号召下去割草。他们赶着一群群的毛驴把青草驮回，然后晒干。家里几代作郎生的妇女次丹拉姆一边晒草，一边告诉记者说：这些草是贮存起来明年春天喂耕牛的。
    在雅鲁藏布江边桑日县的“绒”地方，各村的农民们在农民协会领导下，联合起来整修了一条大水渠。往年夏季修渠，宗本（县长）和寺庙管家下令，工头用皮鞭赶着去修，连修多天还是修不好，有些田地因为放不上水而干枯了，今年农民们是为自己修渠，只一天就修好了。
    现在，山南区沿雅鲁藏布江一带，青稞已秀齐了穗，油菜、豌豆已结荚。喜马拉雅山深谷里有的地方第一次青稞已经收割完毕，种上了荞麦。雅鲁藏布江下游郎县一带苹果、桃子、核桃等结果累累，葡萄已经成串。山南的广大翻身农民在付出辛勤的劳动后，将会得到丰盛的劳动果实。
