Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 10th – Cuban workers are expressing congratulations on the victory of cracking the counter-revolutionary conspiracy case and angrily denouncing the rebellious conspirators.

David Salvador, General Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, today, while announcing the Cuban workers' congratulations on the victory of cracking the counter-revolutionary conspiracy, pointed out that workers should maintain high vigilance against provocations and aggression. The Cuban people, led by the working class, will universally respond to the government's call to jointly smash any domestic conspiracy that undermines national interests and any foreign aggression that infringes upon Cuban sovereignty. Salvador emphasized the need to unite, calmly deal with troublemakers, engage in normal production, and fully support revolutionary laws and the revolutionary government.

Workers at the Ampara Quesada factory held a rally, stating, "When needed, we will exchange machine tools for weapons." The printing workers of "National Daily" said, "We should be taught how to use weapons." Tobacco workers in Trinidad and El Hermanos held a congress, condemning the imperialist conspiracy to make the Cuban people bleed, and expressing their readiness to defend to the death the Cuban revolution, which is threatened by the United States and Trujillo's henchmen, and to defend the sovereignty and independence of the motherland.

In Havana, large cars on the streets were plastered with slogans like "Block Traitors and Conspirators." People celebrated the victory of cracking the counter-revolutionary conspiracy and said in unison, "Shoot them." Some workers expressed "to heighten vigilance and prepare to strengthen the rebel army."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 10th – The details of the counter-revolutionary rebellion conspiracy directed by foreign forces, which was cracked by the Cuban government, have been further revealed. Now, Caines Milanés, Chairman of the Cuban National Cattle Ranchers Association, who was prepared to serve as president after the rebels launched an armed rebellion, as well as other members of the puppet government carefully selected by the United States and scheduled to take power after the rebellion, have all been arrested.

These conspirators were preparing to launch an armed rebellion forty-eight hours earlier, but under the leadership of Cuban Prime Minister Castro, the Cuban people resolutely and quickly crushed the conspiracy.

Caines, the ringleader of the conspiracy who has been arrested, confessed that this rebellion conspiracy "received substantial foreign assistance."

Forty-eight hours before, when the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary group was preparing to launch the rebellion, the official radio station of the Dominican dictatorship, a U.S. pawn, "Voice of the Dominican Republic," said, "The time has come!" giving the conspirators an order to launch an attack on the Cuban government in coordination from within and without.

This Dominican radio station impatiently said: "Invasion of the island of Cuba has already occurred from four places, Castro is dead, and Santiago de Cuba has fallen." These shameless fabrications have become a joke among the residents of Havana. Social order in Havana is good, and on the 9th, the people of Havana spent Sunday happily on the beach as usual.

Currently, the Cuban armed forces and people continue to be vigilant against the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad.

　　古巴工人欢呼粉碎叛乱阴谋
　　美国一手选定的傀儡政府成员全部落网
    新华社哈瓦那10日电　古巴工人纷纷表示庆贺破获反革命阴谋案的胜利，并怒斥阴谋叛乱分子。
    古巴工人联合会总书记戴维·萨尔瓦多今天在宣布古巴工人祝贺破获反革命阴谋的胜利的同时指出，工人们应该对挑衅和侵略保持高度警惕。以工人阶级为首的古巴人民一定会普遍响应政府的号召，来共同粉碎破坏国家利益的任何国内阴谋，和任何侵犯古巴主权的外来侵略。萨尔瓦多强调指出，要团结一致，沉着地对付捣乱分子，正常地从事生产，全力支持革命法律和革命政府。
    阿姆帕拉·克萨达工厂的工人们举行了集会，他们表示，“在需要的时候，我们就把机床换成武器”。“国家日报”的印刷工人说，“应当教会我们使用武器”。特林尼达德和埃尔马诺夫的烟草工人举行了大会，谴责帝国主义企图使古巴人民流血的阴谋，他们表示，准备誓死保卫正受到美国和特鲁希略等爪牙威胁的古巴革命，保卫祖国的主权和独立。
    在哈瓦那，街上的大汽车贴着“挡住叛徒和阴谋分子”的口号。人们庆贺破获反革命阴谋的胜利，并且异口同声地说“枪毙他们”。有的工人表示“要提高警惕和准备去加强起义军”。
    新华社哈瓦那10日电　为古巴政府破获的受外国指使的反革命叛乱阴谋的案情已经进一步揭晓。现在，准备在叛乱者发动武装暴动后担任总统的古巴全国畜牧业者协会主席凯纳斯·米拉内斯，以及由美国精心挑选的其他预定暴动后上台的傀儡政府的成员，已经全部落网。
    这批阴谋分子准备在四十八小时以前举行武装暴动，但是在古巴总理卡斯特罗的领导下，古巴人民坚决而迅速地粉碎了这一阴谋。
    已经被逮捕的阴谋首脑凯纳斯供认，这次叛乱阴谋“得到外国的大量援助”。
    在四十八小时之前，即上述反革命集团准备发动叛乱的时间，美国走卒多米尼加独裁政权的官方电台“多米尼加之声”说，“时间已经到了！”给阴谋分子下命令，以便里应外合地发动对古巴政府的进攻。
    这家多米尼加电台迫不及待地说：“已经从四个地方侵入古巴岛，卡斯特罗毙命，古巴的圣地亚哥已经陷落。”这些无耻捏造成了哈瓦那居民的笑料。哈瓦那的社会秩序良好，在9日，哈瓦那人像平常一样愉快地在海滩上度过了星期天。
    目前，古巴武装部队和人民继续警惕着国内外敌人的阴谋。
