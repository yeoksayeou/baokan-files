If you are a lover of Beijing jade and ivory carvings, you will be impressed by the great changes that have taken place in Beijing's jade and ivory carvings in recent years after visiting the Beijing Arts and Crafts Research Institute, Jade Factory, and Ivory Factory.

One change is that artists have created many excellent works reflecting real life, greatly enriching the creative content of jade and ivory carvings. The jade carving "The Yellow River Clears, Days of Prosperity" ("河清有日"), "Chairman Mao at the Ming Tombs Labor Site," and the ivory carving "Flying Capture of Luding Bridge," which are currently being made, are some of the outstanding works. "The Yellow River Clears, Days of Prosperity" was designed by Wang Shusen, an artist at the Beijing Jade Factory. The work reflects the scene of Chairman Mao inspecting the Yellow River. Carving images of great people on jade is unprecedented. The work uses white jade for the people, green jade for the mountains, and yellow jade for the rolling river. Chairman Mao stands by the river, pointing into the distance, giving people a beautiful vision of golden wheat waves on both sides of the Yellow River. "Flying Capture of Luding Bridge" was designed by Yang Shihui, an artist at the Beijing Arts and Crafts Research Institute. The entire bridge is composed of twelve ivory openwork chains (representing iron chains and iron railings), a unique carving technique in ivory carving. The ends of the bridge are connected to ivory bridgeheads. The warriors, divided into two sides, step on the iron chains, full of fighting spirit, and advance bravely under the guidance of the red flag. This work vividly expresses the heroic image of the Red Army during the Long March, making people deeply appreciate that victory does not come easily and inspiring people to greater enthusiasm for building socialism.

Another change is that, on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward traditions, instead of simply carving a single beautiful woman, many classical works full of life are further created. Examples include the turquoise "Diao Chan's Morning Makeup," "Ying Ning," "Tang Bohu Wooing Qiuxiang," and the ivory carvings "Grand View Garden" and "Leizu Raising Silkworms." In addition, works such as flowers, vases, and jars have been given new content on top of traditional forms. The ivory "Hundred Flowers Orchid" signifies letting a hundred flowers bloom, and the white jade "Eastern Giant Dragon Incense Burner" symbolizes the prosperity and strength of our great motherland.

Beijing's jade and ivory carvings are advancing rapidly. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the millennia-old tradition was broken, and machines were used to reduce physical labor and improve work efficiency without affecting the artistic quality of the works. (Attached picture)

### 玉器牙雕　巧夺天工

    玉器牙雕　巧夺天工
    你如果是北京玉器和牙雕的爱好者，当你参观了北京市工艺美术研究所、玉器厂和象牙厂以后，你就会感到北京的玉器和牙雕这几年来有了多么大的变化。
    其变化之一，就是艺人们创作了许多反映现实生活的好作品，大大的丰富了玉器和牙雕的创作内容。正在制作中的玉器“河清有日”、“毛主席在十三陵劳动”和牙雕“飞夺泸定桥”，就是许多优秀作品中的一部分。“河清有日”是北京玉器厂艺人王树森设计的，作品反映毛主席视察黄河的情景。这种在玉器上雕琢伟人像还是过去没有作过的。作品以白玉作人，碧玉作山，黄玉作滚滚的河水，毛主席站立河旁，遥指远方，给人以黄河两岸一片金色麦浪的美好远景的展望。“飞夺泸定桥”是北京市工艺美术研究所杨士惠艺人设计的，全桥用十二条象牙镂空练子组成（铁索和铁栏杆），这种雕技是牙雕中的首创。桥的两端接在象牙桥头堡内，勇士们分两边踏着铁索，在红旗的前导下，个个斗志昂扬，奋勇前进。这一作品，生动地表达了长征时期红军的英勇形象，使人深刻体会到胜利来之不易，激发人们建设社会主义的更大热情。
    其变化之二，就是在继承和发扬传统的基础上，不是单单雕琢一个单身美女，而是进一步创作了许多富于生活气息的古典作品。如近作松石“貂蝉晓装”、“婴宁”、“唐伯虎点秋香”，象牙“大观园”、“嫘祖育蚕”等等作品。又如花卉、瓶罐等作品，在传统的造型上赋予了新的内容。象牙“百花兰”意味着百花齐放，白玉“东方巨龙花熏”象征着我们伟大祖国的繁荣富强。
    北京的玉器和牙雕正在一日千里的向前迈进，在1958年大跃进中，还打破千年陈规，使用上了机器，减轻体力劳动，提高工作效率，而且丝毫不影响作品的艺术性。（附图片）
