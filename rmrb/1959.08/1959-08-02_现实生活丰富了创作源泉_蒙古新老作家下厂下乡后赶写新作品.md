Real Life Enriches Creative Sources
Mongolian New and Veteran Writers Go to Factories and Countryside, Rushing to Write New Works

Our Ulaanbaatar dispatch, August 1st (Reporter Peng Fengye): Mongolian writers, under the call of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, have gone deep into rural factories, enriching their creative sources from real life. They are now immersed in writing, and many have already written the first drafts of new works.

Secretary-General of the Mongolian Writers' Association, Dashi Dendev, told reporters that the 13th Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party put forward important instructions on Mongolian literary creation, requiring writers to go deep into reality, deep into life, and create works that reflect real life. Responding to the call of the Party, writers have gone to factories and the countryside, some to agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives, some to factories and enterprises, military writers to companies, and children's literature writers to participate in the actual work of children's education. All this has enriched the lives of writers, broadened their horizons, and boosted their creative enthusiasm.

Writer Tsedenzhabu worked as a leader in an agricultural and pastoral cooperative for a period of time and is now writing a novel reflecting the lives of the members. Playwright Hamsuren, after returning from working on the railway, is starting to write a script reflecting the friendship of Mongolian and Soviet railway workers in railway transportation. Poet Gedeb is creating two epic poems praising the work of land reclamation.

Most Mongolian writers are amateur writers, and they also have their own jobs. In order to enable them to go to the countryside and factories, the Mongolian Party and government have made regulations that they can be granted leave for twenty to sixty days each year. This year, more than twenty people have applied to go to the countryside and factories; the Writers' Association is arranging for writers to go down in rotation.

According to the actual situation of Mongolian writers, the Mongolian Writers' Association attaches special importance to two issues: one is to encourage writers to better understand and understand real life. Dashi Dendev pointed out that among the existing more than one hundred Mongolian writers, about half are young people in their twenties who have not experienced much revolutionary training and do not have a deep understanding of real life. If they do not go deep into reality, they will not be able to write works that reflect reality. Secondly, it is necessary to help improve the writers' literary accomplishment and creative quality. In the national movement to advance towards culture, writers are required to improve their theoretical level and literary accomplishment. The Writers' Association will organize writers to participate in night university studies.

The older generation of Mongolian writers are also working hard to create. Old writers such as Damdinsuren, Oyun, and Rinchen have all set out new creative plans.

    现实生活丰富了创作源泉
    蒙古新老作家下厂下乡后赶写新作品
    本报乌兰巴托1日电　记者彭逢烨报道：蒙古作家在蒙古人民革命党的号召下深入农村工厂，从现实生活中丰富了创作源泉，现正埋头创作，许多人已写出了新作品的初稿。
    蒙古作家协会秘书长达西登得布对记者说，蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会和三中全会，对蒙古文学创作提出了重要的指示，要求作家们深入实际，深入生活，创作反映现实生活的作品。作家们响应党的号召，纷纷下厂下乡，有的到农牧业生产合作社去，有的深入工厂企业，部队作家到连队里，儿童文学作家，参加了儿童教育的实际工作。这一切丰富了作家的生活，使他们的眼界更加开阔，创作热情高涨。
    作家策登扎布到农牧业合作社作了一个时期的领导工作，现在正写一本反映社员生活的长篇小说。剧作家哈木苏伦参加铁路工作回来，正开始写一本从铁路运输中反映蒙苏铁路工人友谊的剧本。诗人格德布正在创作歌颂开荒工作的两部长诗。
    蒙古作家绝大部分是业余作家，他们还有自己的工作。蒙古党和政府为了使他们下乡下厂曾作出规定，每年可准假二十天到六十天。今年已有二十多人提出了下乡下厂的申请；作家协会正在进行安排，使作家们轮流下去。
    蒙古作家协会根据蒙古作家的实际情况，特别重视两个问题：一个是鼓励作家更好的深入和了解现实生活。达西登得布指出，现有的一百多名蒙古作家中，一半左右的人是二十多岁的青年，他们没有经历过很多的革命锻炼，对现实生活了解不深，如果不深入实际是写不出反映实际的作品来的。其次，要帮助提高作家们的文学修养和创作质量。在全国开展向文化进军的运动中，要求作家们把理论水平和文学修养提高一步，作家协会将组织作家们参加夜大学学习。
    蒙古老一辈的作家们也在努力创作，达木丁苏伦、奥云、仁亲等老作家，都订出了新的创作计划。
