Exorbitant Medical Costs: Ordinary People Cannot Afford to Be Sick
According to materials from American newspapers, medical expenses in the United States continue to grow at a threatening rate. In the past decade, hospitalization costs have more than doubled, and medical expenses have increased by 40%.

According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, the hospitalization fee for a mental patient for half a year is $7,000, and the hospitalization fee for vascular embolism for six weeks is $2,000. The hospital fee for a maternity patient for six days (including fees paid to doctors and midwives) is $500 to $600. Even an X-ray costs $10 to $15 each time.

In the United States, medicines are so expensive that they are simply unaffordable. The "World Telegram and Sun" recently wrote that the cost of medicine is often higher than the cost of medical treatment. A small box of vitamins for children costs $10. A shot of polio vaccine for a child costs $5. Patients with heart disease and high blood pressure spend about $25 or more per month on medication.

Recently, a bill was introduced in the U.S. Congress that would provide free medical care to certain categories of Americans over the age of sixty-five who receive pensions. Even this insignificant bill has been opposed by a majority of congressmen. Many commentators believe that this bill will never become law. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Flemming considers the bill "unwise" and says that the associated expenses would be unaffordable in the U.S. budget. Congressman Alger accused the drafters of the bill of having "dangerous socialist ideas." The president of the New York State Therapeutic Association, Berger, even said that the bill "undermines the normal responsibilities of the family" and is therefore "communist."

    医药费用奇昂　老百姓病不起
    根据美国报纸材料，美国医疗费用继续以威胁性的速度增长着。最近十年中住院费用上涨了一倍多，医疗费用上涨了40％
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，一个精神病患者半年住院费要七千美元，血管拴塞住院六星期要两千美元。产妇六天住院费（其中包括付给医生、助产士的费用）为五百到六百美元。就连X光透视每次也要花十到十五美元。
    在美国，药品贵得简直买不起。“世界电讯与太阳报”最近写道，药费往往比医疗费还要高。儿童用的一小盒维他命要十美元。要给儿童打一针预防小儿麻痹症的针就要花五美元。心脏病、高血压患者每月大约要花二十五美元以上的药费。
    最近美国国会中有人提出了一项法案，其中规定，六十五岁以上的某些级别的领养老金的美国人可以得到免费医疗。就连这个微不足道的法案也遭到大多数议员的反对。许多评论员认为，这个法案永远不会成为法律。卫生教育和福利部长弗莱明认为这个法案是“不明智的”，并说，与此有关的开支将是美国预算中难以担负的。国会议员阿耳杰恩指责法案起草人有“危险的社会主义思想”。纽约州治疗学协会会长伯杰居然说法案“破坏了家庭的正常责任”，所以是“共产主义的”。
