    Truthfully Describe Our New World and New People
    Surkov Talks About Soviet Writers Experiencing Life on Construction Sites

    (Our Moscow Correspondent, Dai Feng) Soviet Writers' Union Secretary Surkov recently spoke to reporters about the situation in Soviet literary circles after the Third Congress of Soviet Writers (hereinafter referred to as "the Third Congress"). He pointed out that "the Third Congress" and Comrade Khrushchev's report at "the Third Congress" were a tremendous political exercise for all Soviet writers. "The Third Congress" undoubtedly became a new turning point in Soviet literary creation. Surkov said: Soviet writers are resolutely implementing the spirit of "the Third Congress," further approaching the people, approaching life, and striving to truthfully depict and reflect the magnificent era of Soviet communist construction.

    Surkov said: Since "the Third Congress," Soviet literary creation has been on the rise, and the literary circles of various republics have also been very active. They have successively convened writers' congresses, mobilizing and uniting all forces in the Soviet literary circles to serve communist construction. The central content of these meetings was how to concretely fulfill the tasks put forward by the Soviet Communist Party to the writers, and how to further cultivate new literary forces. The meetings showed the unity and vitality of Soviet writers of all nationalities.

    Surkov then pointed out that Soviet writers unanimously believe that under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people have entered a heroic era of comprehensively carrying out communist construction. Writers must deeply experience the creative life and heroic spirit of the working people so that they can truthfully reflect them in their works. He said: Therefore, after "the Third Congress," many writers in various places responded to the Party's call and went to construction sites and rural areas to experience life and collect creative materials. The Soviet "Literary Gazette" organized a creative group to Siberia for the first time and achieved good results. This creative group consisted of twelve people, including the famous poets Bezimensky, Ostrovoy, and the young poet Berestov. They went to the eastern communist construction site of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station, lived among the heroic construction workers, and also went deep into the eastern newly reclaimed land to understand the labor life on the new land. The writer Polevoy also went to the Far East, the famous poet Tvardovsky participated in the project of damming the Azar River, and the writer Vsevolodov, Ivanov, who is now living in Magadan, and many writers from the republics are experiencing life on the construction site.

    Surkov believes that writers closely approaching the people and approaching labor life is an important condition for truthfully depicting the new world and new people of the magnificent and heroic era, and also a new and important achievement after "the Third Congress." He said: Now all the writers who have gone deep into the great communist construction sites and deep into the boiling labor life have not only broadened their horizons but also collected a large amount of valuable material for future creation. We believe that the future creations of these writers will become a new turning point in Soviet literature. The working people in various places warmly welcomed the writers who came to the construction sites and collective farms, and the reality of life educated the writers. When the writers of the creative group who went to Siberia returned to Moscow not long ago, three of them submitted applications to join the Party. Now the second and third batches of creative groups going deep into life are about to set off.

    Surkov then pointed out that literary creation requires a process of time, and it is difficult for these writers who have gone deep into labor life to write successful masterpieces in a short period of time. The poets Berestov and Ostrovoy have already begun to write beautiful poems praising the life of communist labor construction. He said, it is always like this: first there are poems and newsletters, then short stories, and finally long masterpieces. We expect to see the truly excellent fruits of "the Third Congress" by the end of this year.

    Surkov said: Our country is in a period of economic construction upsurge, and at the same time, it is in a cultural construction upsurge. Communist construction is not only economic construction but also construction in the ideological and spiritual aspects. Soviet writers are the most lofty and advanced propagandists of thought, and they feel deeply happy to be charged with the glorious task of educating and cultivating new people with a high communist spirit. Our readers are eagerly awaiting works with new ideas, rich content, and superb artistic skills. Surkov finally said: According to the spirit of "the Third Congress," Soviet writers are actively fulfilling the lofty expectations of the Party and the people for us.

    真实地描写我们的新世界和新人物
    苏尔科夫谈苏联作家到建设工地体验生活情况
    本报莫斯科1日电　记者戴枫报道：苏联作家协会书记苏尔科夫最近同记者谈到苏联第三次作家代表大会（下称“三大”）后苏联文学界情况时指出，“三大”和赫鲁晓夫同志在
  “三大”上所作的报告，对全苏作家是一个巨大的政治锻炼。“三大”无疑的成为苏联文学创作方面一个新的转折点。苏尔科夫说：苏联作家们正在坚决贯彻“三大”精神，进一步接近人民，接近生活，并努力于真实地描写反映苏联共产主义建设的雄伟时代。
    苏尔科夫说：“三大”以后，苏联文学创作处于继续高涨之中，各加盟共和国文学界也非常活跃，先后召开了作家大会，动员与团结苏联文学界一切力量，为共产主义建设服务。这些会议讨论的中心内容是：如何具体地完成苏联共产党对作家们提出的任务，如何进一步培养文学新生力量。会议表明了苏联各民族作家们团结一致，生气蓬勃。
    苏尔科夫接着指出，苏联作家们一致地认为，在苏联共产党的领导下，苏联人民进入了全面开展共产主义建设的豪迈时代。作家必须深入体验劳动人民创造性的生活和英雄气概，使其得以在自己的作品中真实地反映出来。他说：因此“三大”之后，各地许多作家响应党的号召，纷纷到建设工地，到农村去体验生活，搜集创作材料。苏联“文学报”首次组织去西伯利亚的创作小组，获得良好成绩。这个创作小组共十二人，其中包括著名诗人别兹明斯基、奥斯特罗沃依和青年诗人别列斯托夫等。他们到了布拉次克水电站的东部共产主义建设工地，生活在英勇劳动的建设者之中，而且还深入到东部新垦地，了解了新地上劳动生活。作家波列沃依也到了远东，著名诗人特瓦尔多夫斯基参加了拦断阿扎尔河的工程，现在正住在马加丹的作家维塞沃洛夫、伊万诺夫和许多加盟共和国作家一起，在建设工地上体验生活。
    苏尔科夫认为，作家们紧密地接近人民，接近劳动生活，这是真实地描写壮丽、豪迈时代的新世界、新人物的重要条件，也是“三大”之后新的重要成就。他说：现在所有深入到伟大共产主义建设工地，深入到沸腾的劳动生活中去的作家们，不仅扩大了眼界，而且为未来的创作搜集了大量的宝贵的材料。我们相信，这些作家未来的创作将成为苏联文学中的一个新的转折。各地劳动人民热烈地欢迎了来到工地和农庄的作家们，现实的生活教育了作家。去西伯利亚的创作组作家们，不久前回到莫斯科时，其中有三位作家提出了要求入党的申请书。现在第二、三批深入生活的创作小组即将出发。
    苏尔科夫接着指出，文学创作需要一段过程时间，目前这些深入劳动生活的作家们，在短时期内还难于写出成功的巨著。诗人别列斯托夫和奥斯特罗沃依已开始写出歌颂共产主义劳动建设生活的优美诗篇。他说，总是这样的：首先出现诗作、通讯，然后出现短篇小说，最后才是长篇巨著。我们期望到今年年底时会见到“三大”的真正优秀果实。
    苏尔科夫说：我们的国家正处在经济建设高涨时期，同时处于文化建设高潮中，共产主义建设不仅仅是经济建设，而且也是在思想精神方面的建设。苏联作家们是最崇高、最先进的思想的宣传者，他们以负有教育和培养高度共产主义精神的新人的光荣任务而深感幸福。我们的读者迫切地等待着具有新的思想、内容丰富、艺术技巧高超的作品。苏尔科夫最后说：苏联作家们根据“三大”精神，正在积极地完成党和人民对我们的崇高期望。
