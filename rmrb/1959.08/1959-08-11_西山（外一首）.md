West Mountain (and another poem)
Liu Lanshan

	Stretching out its green arms, it protects Beijing from the west;
	Yanshan comes from the north, shaking hands and standing shoulder to shoulder with you.
	Looking at the new houses like bamboo shoots after a rain,
	The blood vessel-like highways connect to your body;
	You happily吐 (tǔ - spit) out烏金 (wū jīn - literal: black gold) ore,
	You urge the saplings all over the mountain to grow quickly.
	The Yongding River passes by your feet,
	This wild horse is already very tame:
	The clear water flows like a lark,
	Singing for Beijing day and night.
	In this long summer noon,
	It's nice to cool off under the walnut tree,
	The old commune member also tells about the struggles of that year,
	Originally he was the leader of the West Mountain guerrilla squad.
	Although not very tall,
	But you are as proud as Mount Tai:
	The heart of the motherland is by your side,
	Oh, West Mountain, Beijing's green windbreak.

	Under the scorching sun,
	In the heavy rain,
	We go up and down the mountain,
	Down and up the mountain,
	One Masson pine,
	One 赤心 (chì xīn - red heart),
	Planted on the mountain,
	Crowned with white clouds.
	Children, Masson pines,
	Basking in the sun,
	Facing the wind and rain;
	We grow up like this,
	Like your fathers, the evergreen pines.
	Planting Masson pines all over the mountain,
	We leave and come back again,
	Looking, looking, fifteen years later,
	Fifteen years later,
	A green world,
	A green Great Wall.

　　西山（外一首）
　　刘岚山伸出绿色的臂膀，从西面护卫着北京；燕山打北边走来，和你拉手又并肩。望着新房子像雨后春笋，血管一样的公路通到身上；你欢畅地吐出乌金矿石，你催着满山小树苗快快成长。永定河从你脚边走过，这匹野马已经很驯良：清清的水流像百灵鸟，日日夜夜为北京歌唱。在这长夏的中午，核桃树下正好乘凉，老社员又讲起当年的斗争，原来他是西山游击队小组长。个子虽然并不高大，但你同泰山一样自豪：祖国的心脏在你身边，哦，西山，北京的绿色风屏。
    马尾松在烈日下，在暴雨中，我们上山下山，下山上山，一棵马尾松，一颗赤心，栽在山上，冠戴着白云。小孩儿，马尾松，晒着太阳，迎着风雨；我们就是这样地长成，像你的父辈那不老松。遍山栽罢马尾松，走了又回来，望着望着十五年后，十五年后，绿色的世界，绿色的长城。
