　　Underground Chicken Farm

　　On a clear and breezy holiday, we visited the underground chicken farm in Stassfurt, Halle Administrative Region, German Democratic Republic.

　　Mine Depths Have Suitable Temperatures, Raising Over 50,000 Chickens

　　As soon as I put on the miner's work clothes, I felt a little nervous, as it was my first time going down a mine! The elevator took us down to a mine shaft 400 meters deep. Once at the bottom, the air was fresh, breathing was normal, and the lights were bright, so the nervousness naturally disappeared. Upon inquiring, I learned that 1,000 cubic meters of fresh air are pumped in from the surface every minute. The mine has two levels, about ten meters apart. A single mine shaft is about twenty meters wide and ten meters high, like a large tunnel for trains, with a total area of 10,000 square meters. This used to be a potash mine, but mining ceased in 1902, and the mine shaft was not humid, but it had remained unused. Comrade Kautz, the chicken-raising expert accompanying us, explained, "The temperature here stays around 20 degrees Celsius year-round, which is very suitable for chicken growth. On September 20th of last year, I brought twenty chickens and started experimental work here." Now, there are 8,000 laying hens and 50,000 meat chickens here. He also discussed the chicken-raising methods in detail.

　　Only Thirteen or Fourteen Workers Can Raise Up to 400,000 Chickens

　　After the eggs hatch, if they are chickens for meat, they are immediately sent here, with light exposure for up to sixteen hours. The chicks are also illuminated with infrared lamps to raise the temperature to around 35 degrees Celsius, to promote chick growth. Once the chickens grow larger, the infrared light is no longer needed. After ten weeks, the chickens grow to about one kilogram and can be slaughtered. As for the hens, they are raised outside for five months, and when they are able to lay eggs, they are moved here. They are raised here for six months, laying 150 to 160 eggs. Hens that are eleven months old are in their "prime," and must be slaughtered, otherwise the chicken meat will be too tough. Two batches of hens can be raised per year. Starting this summer, 100,000 meat chickens will be raised, four batches a year, for a total of 400,000 chickens per year; at the same time, 35,000 hens will be raised, two batches a year, for a total of 70,000 chickens per year. I asked curiously, "Why do the laying hens have to be raised outside for five months first?" Comrade Kautz said with a smile, "If the hens come here from a young age, they develop too quickly and can only lay small eggs. We want to get large eggs." When he talked about management, he said with a smile, "There are only thirteen or fourteen workers here, and the construction cost is very low, ten times cheaper than building a chicken farm above ground."

　　Hen Laying Eggs Not Affected by Season, Some Hens Lay Three Eggs in Two Days

　　The egg-laying rate here is 70%, in other words, every hundred hens lay seventy eggs per day, and it is not affected by the season. On the ground, the egg-laying rate of hens is only 50%, and it is also affected by the season. Comrade Kautz explained this point, "If the light exposure time is eight hours and the dark time is eight hours, a day and night is only sixteen hours. Our two days and nights have forty-eight hours, while here it is three days and nights. Under these circumstances, experiments have proven that some hens can lay three eggs. We are still continuing the experiment."

### 地下养鸡场

　　地下养鸡场
    在一个风和气爽的晴朗的假日里，我们到德意志民主共和国哈雷行政区施塔斯福特参观了那里的地下养鸡场。
    矿井深处气温适宜  养鸡已达五万多只
    一穿上矿工的工作服，心里就有点紧张，我是第一次下矿坑呢！升降机把我们送到了深达四百多米的地下矿坑里。一到底下，空气新鲜，呼吸正常，灯光明亮，紧张的心情自然就莫须有了。一打听，原来每分钟从地面上通入一千立方米的新鲜空气。矿坑有两层，间隔约十米。一个矿坑宽约二十米，高十米，像是通行火车的大隧道，共有面积一万平方米。这里原来是钾盐矿，1902年起便停止开采，矿坑不潮湿，但一直没有什么用处。陪同参观的养鸡专家考茨同志解释道：“这里气温保持在摄氏二十度左右，终年不变，很适宜于鸡的生长。去年9月20日，我带了二十只鸡，开始在这里进行试验工作。”现在，这里已有八千只下蛋的母鸡和五万只供食用的小公鸡了。他还详细谈了养鸡方法。
　  工人只有十三、四人养鸡可达四十万只
    蛋孵化以后，如饲养食用的鸡，便立即送到这里来，光照时间长达十六小时，幼鸡并加以红外光灯照，使温度提高到摄氏三十五度左右，以利幼鸡生长。鸡一大，红外光就用不到了。十个星期，鸡长到一公斤左右，便可宰杀。至于母鸡，先在外面饲养五个月，到了能下蛋的时候，便迁居到这里。在这里饲养半年，下蛋一百五、六十个。长了十一个月的母鸡，正是“壮年时代”，便要宰杀，否则鸡肉太老。一年可以饲养两批母鸡。今年夏天起，将饲养十万只食用的鸡，一年四批，一年可养四十万只；同时养三万五千只母鸡，一年两批，每年可养七万只。我好奇地问：“下蛋的母鸡，为什么先要在上面饲养五个月呢？”考茨同志笑着说：“母鸡如果从小就到这里，发育太快，只能生小蛋，我们希望得到大鸡蛋。”他谈到经营管理工作时笑着说：“这里只有十三、四个工人，修建费很少，比在上面修养鸡场便宜十倍。”
　  母鸡下蛋不受季节影响　有的母鸡两天下蛋三个
    这里鸡的下蛋率是70％，换句话说，每一百只母鸡，每天下蛋七十个，而且不受季节的影响。地面上的母鸡，下蛋率只有50％，而且还受到季节的影响。考茨同志就这一点作了解释：“如果光照时间是八小时，闭灯时间也是八小时，一昼夜便只有十六小时。我们的两昼夜有四十八小时，而这里则是三昼夜了。在这种情况下，实验已证明，有的母鸡就能下三个蛋。我们还在继续试验。”　　（刘祺宝）
