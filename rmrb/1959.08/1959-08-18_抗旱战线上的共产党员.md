Communist Party Members on the Anti-Drought Front
　　Qun Sheng
    In Hubei Province, on both sides of the Yangtze River, a province-wide, all-people anti-drought campaign to "Subdue the Drought Demon and Fight the Sky for Grain" is in full swing. Tens of thousands of Communist Party members are taking the lead, overcoming difficulties, and leading the broad masses of people to dig water sources day and night and bring water up the mountains.... In the struggle, countless heroic and selfless deeds have emerged. What is described below is only a small part of the facts.

          "Anti-Drought Experimental Field"
    After the drought occurred, most of the cadres and masses in the Lianping Management Area of Wangdian Commune, Dangyang County, actively joined the anti-drought struggle, but some people still had the passive idea of ​​waiting for rain. Especially for fields with poor water sources, they felt that there was no way to fight the drought and prepared to abandon them. At this time, Zhang Changxin, the secretary of the general branch of the management area, decided to select 51 mu of middle rice in the seventh team of the Guangming Production Team, which had the worst conditions, as his "anti-drought experimental field." These fields were famous "Gan Jia Fan" throughout the management area. They had neither ponds nor weirs, and had to rely on the weather every year. When Zhang Changxin went deep among the masses to visit and seek anti-drought methods, people just shook their heads and said: "Besides a heavy rain, there is no way to think of it!" But Lao Zhang was not discouraged. He visited many old farmers and finally found a solution from a conversation with the old farmer Guo Shunde. So he immediately convened a meeting of all team members, introduced the method proposed by Guo Shunde to everyone, and asked everyone to discuss whether it would work. When the masses heard that there was a solution, they immediately became energetic, planned to build a bridge overnight, and automatically took out 23 boxes, 41 pieces of wood, and 17 door panels as equipment for building the bridge and making the canal. After a day and night of hard work, a 17-zhang-long wooden bridge was built, and a 250-meter-long water-receiving ditch was dug. Not only was the 51 mu of middle rice field irrigated, but also the historical "Gan Jia Fan" was turned into self-flowing irrigation. This matter immediately spread throughout the entire management area, greatly boosting the morale of the masses. People said:
  "The famous 'Gan Jia Fan' has become self-flowing irrigation, what else can't we fight against the drought." So they actively tried to find ways to fight the drought. Now, 757 mu of fields in the entire management area that were originally considered hopeless have also been irrigated.

    Researching Together with the Masses
    In the Xingyan Production Team of Hejia Management Area, Lixian Commune, Suixian County, a big debate was launched over the issue of water for drought resistance: Zhao Yongfeng, the captain of the second team, advocated using waterwheels to pump water from the weir, and to fight as much as possible. He Xianzhi, the captain of the brigade, advocated building dams and opening canals to divert water for long-distance diversion and near-distance irrigation. The rice in the Xingyan team was affected by drought over a large area, and a lot of water was needed for drought resistance. Which method was the best? He Rufa, the director of the management area and a Communist Party member who led the fight against drought in this team, carefully listened to people's debates and analyzed and studied with everyone. Finally, he came to the conclusion: In dry weather, the water from the weir can be used to relieve the emergency, but it cannot increase the water source. The amount pumped one day is less than the previous, and it cannot last for a long time in drought resistance. There is a river nearby. Building a river dam and opening a canal to divert water can combine drought resistance with water conservancy construction, and can turn waterwheel fields into water-release fields. It is a good method that requires less labor and yields greater results. Is it appropriate to open a canal to divert water here? He Rufa decided to participate in the survey himself.
    The next morning, He Rufa and several other people set off. When they arrived at the Zengjia River, they couldn't bear to leave. The terrain here is high, the water flow is rapid, and it is a mountain pass. Building a dam here to raise the water level will allow the water to flow along the right bank of the mountain pass and open a canal to irrigate the fields of the third, fourth, and fifth teams. They determined the dam site, planned the canal line, and that afternoon, more than 150 laborers joined the battle. He Rufa took the lead in getting into the water to drive piles and carry stones. The team members took turns, but he did not. When asked to rest, he refused. Seeing their director working so hard for drought resistance, everyone's determination and enthusiasm became even greater. The elderly team member He Kailin also stayed on the construction site for three days and three nights.
    After three days and three nights of hard work, a five-zhang-long, five-chi-high, and one-zhang-wide dam was built, and a five-li-long winding canal was also dug, and seven small branch canals were also dug. The blocked river water gradually rose and finally forced its way into the canal, flowing docilely into the fields of the three teams. Two hundred and fifteen mu of fields that had been cracked by the drought became good fields with self-flowing irrigation and guaranteed harvests.
    As the canal was completed and the water flowed, the team members were about to let He Rufa take a good rest, but he quietly came to the waterwheel construction site of the fifth team and started pumping water with the team members. He pumped water there for three days, and reasonably solved the problems of labor quotas and tool repairs in the fight against drought. This enabled the fifth team to create a new water pumping record.

          Finding Water Sources in High Mountains
    Xiong Zuochu, the Party branch secretary of the Jinxi Production Team of the Changchun Management Area of Xiangxi Commune, Zigui County, Hubei Province, is a 26-year-old young man. After the anti-drought struggle began, Zhou Zujin, the director of the management area, called him and asked, "Little Xiong, can you guarantee that the rice will not be affected by the disaster?" He agreed, "Yes! Yes!" But his heart was as anxious as if it were on fire. The production team planted a lot of late rice this year, and it is now budding and heading. But a drought occurred at this critical moment! The water in the paddy fields was dry, and densely packed cracks more than an inch wide appeared in the fields. The leaves of the seedlings were curled and yellow. It was really difficult to rescue these late rice plants.
    He hurried to the fields and discussed with the production team cadres. Everyone said that the older generation had said more than once that there was a spring in Liangshui Gully, but the spring disappeared due to a mountain collapse that year. He thought that since someone had seen it, there must be water. If the spring could be found, the problem would be solved. They sent three team members to the mountain to find water. Who knew that in the evening, the team members who were looking for water returned and said that the mountain was bare and there was no water at all. He became even more anxious. Looking at the disappointed faces of the team members, he heard Zhou's voice again, "Little Xiong! We must overcome the drought and ensure a good harvest." He resolutely stood up and said to the production team leader, "You lead everyone to continue carrying water, and I will go up the mountain!" After talking with a few old farmers, he led five team members up the mountain. He almost always climbed with his ear close to the ground. When he heard a slight sound, he would knock and listen. When he was sure that he didn't hear anything, he would continue to climb forward. In this way, once, twice... He finally found the spring underground. They dug more than four chi deep, and the spring water began to gush out, as thick as a bowl. It was midnight. The moon began to set in the west, and the stars twinkled in the sky. They also built a two-li-long ditch along the hillside overnight to divert the spring water to the fields.

    As Brave in Fighting Drought as in War
    Comrade Xuechun is really capable,
    Hard work, practical work, and skillful work,
    In order to fight drought and ensure increased production,
    Organize the masses to fight drought,
    Pump water day and night to irrigate the fields,
    The rice seedlings are happy to grow with water,
    All team members learn and catch up,
    Strive to become a Red Banner Team.
    This is a big-character poster written by the Party General Branch of the Jiepai Management Area, Tianmen County, to Communist Party member Kuang Xuechun, praising his advanced role in the anti-drought struggle.
    Kuang Xuechun was assigned to work in the Chengguan Lime Factory after being discharged from the army in 1954. He only participated in agricultural production in June this year. As soon as he arrived in the countryside, he encountered the tense anti-drought battle. The Party General Branch assigned him to serve as the captain of the commando team in the Gulao Production Team to organize and lead the militia to fight drought. He happily accepted. This commando team has a total of forty male and female militia members. Because he endured hardship and took the lead in everything, and rationally allocated labor, the team members became more and more enthusiastic. In the short three days and three nights of hard work, he led all the team members to eliminate red spiders in 97 mu of cotton fields, and irrigated 54 mu of cotton fields and 174 mu of rice fields, restoring the drought-stricken seedlings to life. In this way, the Gulao Production Team, which has always been rated as a third-class team, has now risen to a second-class team. The team members praised: "Xuechun is a good Party member and a good cadre. He is a role model for us to learn from." (Attached picture)

　　抗旱战线上的共产党员
　　群声
    在大江两岸的湖北省，一场“降伏旱魔、与天争粮”的全党全民抗旱运动正在如火如荼地进行。成千上万的共产党员们身先士卒、战胜困难，带动广大人民群众夜以继日挖掘水源，引水上山……。在斗争中表现出无数英雄、忘我的动人事迹。下面所记述的，只不过是他们之中的点滴事实。
          “抗旱试验田”
    旱象发生后，当阳县王店公社莲坪管理区大多数干部和群众都积极投入了抗旱斗争，但也有部分人存在着等天下雨的消极思想。特别是对水源差的田，他们认为无法可抗，准备丢了不管。这时，管理区总支书记张昌新决定选择条件最差的光明生产队第七小队的五十一亩中稻，作为他的“抗旱试验田”。这些田是全管理区有名的“干家畈”，既无塘，又无堰，历年都要靠天吃饭。当张昌新深入到群众中进行访问，寻求抗旱的办法时，人们只摇头说：“除了下场大雨外，别无办法可想！”但是老张并没有灰心，他访问了许多老农，终于从同老农郭顺德的谈话中找到了解决办法。于是他马上召开了全队社员会，向大家介绍了郭顺德提出的办法，让大家讨论行不行。群众一听说有了办法，劲头马上就来了，连夜计划搭桥，并自动拿出了箱子二十三个，木料四十一根，门板十七块，作为搭桥制涧的器材。经过一天一夜的奋战，搭起了一道十七丈长的木桥，挖开了一条二百五十米长的接水沟，不仅使五十一亩中稻田灌上了水，而且使历史上的“干家畈”变成了自流灌溉。这件事马上就在全管理区传开了，大大鼓舞了群众的斗志。人们说：
  “有名的‘干家畈’都变成了自流灌溉，我们还有什么不能抗旱的。”于是积极想办法抗旱。现在，全管理区已有七百五十七亩原来认为无救的田也灌上了水。
    和群众一起研究
    随县历县公社何家管理区星炎生产队，为抗旱用水的事，开展了一场大争论：二小队队长赵永凤主张把堰塘的水车起来，能抗多少是多少。大队队长何仙芝却主张筑坝开渠引水，远引近灌。星炎队的水稻受旱面积较大，抗旱需水多，哪个办法最好呢？在这个队领导抗旱的管理区主任共产党员何儒发细心倾听人们的争论，并同大家分析研究，最后得出了这样的结论：天旱无雨车堰水可以救急，但不能增加水源，车一天少一天，不能坚持长期抗旱。附近有河，筑河坝，开渠引水，却可以把抗旱与兴修水利结合起来，可以把车水田改成放水田，是个费工小，收效大的好办法。在这里开渠引水合适吗？何儒发决定自己参加勘察。
    次日大清早，何儒发就和另外几个人出发了。来到曾家河一看，他们舍不得走了。这里地势高，水流急，又是一个夹山咀，在这里拦河筑坝，抬高水位，水就可以顺右岸山咀开渠引到三、四、五三个小队灌田。他们决定了坝址，计划好渠道线，当天下午，一百五十多个劳力就投入了战斗。何儒发带头下到水里打桩，抬石头，社员换班，他不换班，叫他休息，他也不休息。社员们看他们主任为抗旱这样苦干，大家的决心和劲头也更大了，老年社员何开林也三天三夜没下工地。
    经过三天三夜的苦战，一条五丈长、五尺高、一丈宽的拦河大坝筑起来了，五里长的盘山渠道也挖通了，并且还挖了七条小支渠，被挡住了的河水，渐渐升高，终于逼进了渠道，驯服地流向三个小队的田里。二百一十五亩干得发裂的田，变成了自流灌溉保收的好田。
    渠成水流，社员们正要何儒发好好休息下，想不到他却悄悄来到五小队车水工地上，和社员们一起车起水来。他在那里车了三天水，把抗旱中的劳动定额、工具修理等问题都合理的解决了。使五小队创造了车水新纪录。
          高山找水源
    湖北省山区秭归县香溪公社长春管理区金星生产队党支部书记熊作楚是一个二十六岁的小伙子。抗旱斗争开始以后，管理区主任周祖金打电话问他：“小熊呀，能不能保证水稻不受灾？”他口里答应：“行！行！”心里却像火燎着一样焦急，生产队今年栽的晚稻多，现在正含苞出穗，可偏在这节骨眼上发生了旱灾！稻田里的水干了，田里密密麻麻的裂开了一寸多宽大口子，秧苗叶儿卷了、黄了。要抢救这些晚稻真是困难重重。
    他匆匆的走到田边，找生产队干部商量，大家说，老辈人不止一次的说过，凉水沟有一股泉水，不知那年崩山，泉水不见了，他想既然有人见过，就一定有水，要是把这股泉水找出来，问题就解决了。他们派了三个社员到山上找水，谁知到了晚上，找水的社员回来说，山是光秃秃的，根本没有水。他更加着急了。他看着社员们失望的面孔，耳边又响起了周主任的声音：“小熊啊！一定要战胜干旱，保住丰收。”他毅然的站起来对生产队长说：“你领导大家继续挑水，我上山去！”说罢又同几个老农谈了谈，便带领五个社员上山去了。他几乎一直是把耳朵贴着地面往上爬的，听到一点细微的声音就敲敲听听，到确实没有听到什么动静的时候又继续往前爬，就这样一次、两次……他终于在地底下把那股泉水找着了。他们挖了四尺多深，泉水就开始往外涌，足有碗口粗，这时已半夜了。月亮开始西斜，星星在空中眨眼。他们又连夜顺着山坡修了一条两里多路长的沟，把泉水引到田里来。
    抗旱和打仗一样勇敢
    学春同志真能干，
    苦干实干加巧干，
    为了抗旱保增产，
    组织群众来抗旱，
    日夜车水灌田地，
    禾苗得水长得欢，
    全体社员来学赶，
    争取当上红旗班。
    这是天门县界牌管理区党总支给共产党员匡学春写的大字报，表扬他在抗旱斗争中的先进作用。
    匡学春1954年复员回家后，被分配到城关石灰厂工作，参加农业生产还是今年6月间的事。他一到农村，就碰上了紧张的抗旱战斗，党总支分派他到古老生产队担任突击队长，组织和领导基干民兵抗旱。他愉快地接受了。这个突击队共有男女民兵四十人。由于他吃苦在前，事事带头，合理地调配劳力，队员们的干劲愈来愈大，在短短三天三夜的苦战中，他领导全体队员消灭了九十七亩棉田的红蜘蛛，并把五十四亩棉田和一百七十四亩稻田都灌上了水，使受了旱的禾苗恢复了生机。这样，一贯被评为三类队的古老生产队，现在已上升为二类队了。社员称赞说：“学春是个好党员、好干部，是我们学习的榜样。”（附图片）
