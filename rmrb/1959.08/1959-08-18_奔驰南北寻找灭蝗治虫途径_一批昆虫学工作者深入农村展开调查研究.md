Xinhua News Agency, 17th: In this sultry and oppressive season, when insects breed and multiply, a group of entomologists are in the field all over the country, braving the scorching sun to capture all kinds of small insects and study their life patterns and habits in order to find ways to eliminate pests and breed beneficial insects, supporting production and construction.

A scientific team led by entomologist Ma Shijun is studying and observing the implementation of the locust control plan in locust-affected areas such as Shandong. The current goal of locust control workers is to eliminate locusts before the third instar. The locust control plan is based on the spirit of combining temporary and permanent solutions, proposing measures from two aspects: improving locust control technology and transforming locust areas - building water conservancy projects, turning fields into gardens, and afforestation. Through years of investigation and research and summarizing the experiences of the masses, entomologists have clarified that the species of locust in China is "East Asian migratory locust," have identified the situation of locust areas in our country and the area of locust areas, and have initially grasped the rules of locust growth and development. The locust control plan was compiled on the basis of these research results. The rural people's commune has created extremely favorable conditions for the implementation of the locust control plan. At present, one-third of the locust areas in the country, about 10 million mu of land, have begun to implement this plan.

A team of entomologists led by Zhu Hongfu, deputy director of the Institute of Entomology, is studying the prevention and control methods of cotton bollworms - pink bollworm, "diamond back moth," cotton bollworm, etc. in Jiangling County, Hubei Province. They must first find the overwintering places and parasitic plants of these pests, so as to eliminate them before cotton grows in winter. They have found a lot of information about the overwintering of bollworm pests, which have not been recorded in writing in the past. For example, in the past, it was believed that pink bollworms overwintered in warehouses, but now it has been found that they also exist near houses and in the wild; and it has been found that the pupation period of pink bollworms in the wild is earlier than that in warehouses.

Armyworm is a major pest of grain and occurs almost every year in the Northeast. According to entomologists, no country in the world has figured out how armyworms overwinter. A group composed of the Institute of Entomology, led by entomologist Lin Changshan, the Jilin Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Department of Biology of Peking University is studying this issue in Jilin and Heilongjiang. In the past, people in the Northeast have found pupae similar to armyworms, but no conclusion has been drawn. Later, entomologists conducted field artificial cultivation of armyworms overwintering in the Northeast, but the armyworms all froze to death in winter. This spring, a "Hundred Schools of Thought" forum on the overwintering of armyworms was held at the Jilin Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences. There were two opinions at the meeting: one opinion was that the armyworms in the Northeast flew from Guannei (areas south of the Shanhaiguan Pass) with the wind in early spring and did not overwinter in the Northeast. The other opinion opposed the above statement, believing that the armyworms in the Northeast did not fly from Guannei, because there were also armyworms harming in Guannei, and there was also grain for the armyworms to eat in Guannei, so why fly to the Northeast, and the Northeast is more? Which statement is right is now being further investigated and studied.

Entomologists are also conducting on-the-spot investigations and research on rice pests, forest pests, livestock pests, termites, etc.

There are also many insects that are beneficial to people. For example, "Cordyceps sinensis", bees, lac insects, etc. The Institute of Entomology is conducting investigations and research on some of these beneficial insects, and some have completed the investigation and research work.

It is often said that insects parasitize on plants, but there are also opposite situations. A "fungus" (microorganism) parasitizes on a larva, and after the insect dies, small grasses grow on the head of the insect. This is the Chinese medicine "Cordyceps sinensis" that mainly treats deficiency syndromes. This herb grows in alpine meadow areas (areas where only grass grows and no trees or shrubs grow) on the Tibetan Plateau at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 meters, and is only wild, not domesticated. It is very hard for the local people to collect this medicine. They need to lie on the ground, blow open the grass, and look carefully. In the past, no one had studied its growth and reproduction rules. Now a group of researchers from the Institute of Entomology is conducting investigations and research on the Tibetan Plateau, with the goal of enabling "Cordyceps sinensis" to be artificially cultivated in areas below 3,000 meters above sea level, so that it can be produced in large quantities.

The shellac secreted by lac insects is of great use in industry. The Sino-Soviet scientific cooperation on lac insect research has been completed, and entomologists are now guiding farmers to develop shellac production on a large scale.

Entomologists are also studying the selection of bee species.

Insect fauna surveys can be said to be the basic construction work of entomology and are the work of finding out the bottom line; the content of the survey is the types and distribution of insects. The Institute of Entomology has been conducting this work for several years. Now a group of people are investigating in Yunnan, and another group is cooperating with the Jiangxi Agricultural College to investigate in Xinjiang. In the past, they only collected specimens during the survey, and did not pay enough attention to the practical problems in production. After the rectification movement, this year's work style has been significantly improved. While collecting specimens during the survey, they are also helping local people solve important problems in production. This spring, the personnel conducting the fauna survey in some areas of Xinjiang helped local farmers eliminate the mulberry tree pest "mulberry geometrid moth", and in the summer they helped local people eliminate the cotton seedling pest "cutworm".

Since this year, two-thirds of the staff of the Institute of Entomology have been distributed in many areas of the country, cooperating with local relevant scientific departments and production departments, and actively conducting insect investigation and research work closely related to production and construction.

    奔驰南北寻找灭蝗治虫途径
　　一批昆虫学工作者深入农村展开调查研究
    新华社17日讯　在这溽暑困人，虫类孳生繁殖的季节里，一批昆虫学工作者正在祖国各地野外，顶着烈日捕捉各式各样的小虫，研究它们的生活规律和习性，以便找出消灭害虫和繁殖益虫的途径，支援生产建设。
    由昆虫学家马世骏领导的一支科学队伍，正在山东等地蝗区研究和观察根治蝗害方案实施的情况。治蝗工作者现阶段的奋斗目标是消灭蝗虫在三令以前。根治蝗害方案是根据治标与治本相结合的精神，从提高灭蝗技术与改造蝗区——兴修水利、园田化和绿化——两个方面提出措施。昆虫学工作者经过近几年来的调查研究和总结群众经验，明确了中国蝗虫的种类是“东亚飞蝗”，查清了我国蝗区的情况和蝗区面积，初步掌握了蝗虫生长发育的规律。根治蝗害方案就是在这些研究结果的基础上编制出来的。农村人民公社化给实施治蝗方案创造了极有利的条件。现在全国已有三分之一的蝗区约一千万亩土地，已经开始实施这个方案。
    由昆虫研究所副所长朱弘复领导的一支昆虫学工作者队伍，正在湖北省江陵县研究棉花蕾铃害虫——红铃虫、“金钢钻”、棉铃虫等的防治方法。他们首先要找出这些害虫越冬的场所和寄生植物，以便在冬季棉花没有生长以前就把它们消灭。他们已经找到了不少有关蕾铃害虫越冬的资料，都是过去没有文字记载过的。例如过去认为红铃虫在仓库内越冬，现在发现在房屋旁边和野外也有；并且发现野外的红铃虫化蛹的时期比仓库内的要早些。
    粘虫是粮食的一大害虫，在东北几乎年年发生。粘虫怎样越冬，据昆虫学家说，世界各国都没有弄清楚这个问题。由昆虫学家林昌善领导的昆虫研究所和吉林省农业科学院、北京大学生物系共同组成的一个小组，正在吉林、黑龙江研究这个问题。过去有人在东北发现过类似粘虫的蛹，但没有作出结论，后来，昆虫学工作者在东北进行过野外人工培养粘虫过冬的工作，可是粘虫都在冬季冻死了。今年春天，在吉林省农业科学院开了一个关于粘虫越冬问题的百家争鸣会。会上有两种说法：一种说法认为东北的粘虫是在早春时节从关内随风飞去的，不是在东北越冬的。另一种说法反对上述说法，认为东北的粘虫不是从关内飞去的，因为关内也有粘虫为害，粘虫在关内也有粮食可吃，为什么要飞到东北去，而且东北比关内多？倒底那一种说法对，现在正在进一步调查研究。
    对于稻害虫、森林害虫、畜牧害虫、白蚁等，昆虫学工作者也都在进行实地调查研究。
    昆虫中也有许多对人们有好处的。例如
  “冬虫夏草”、蜜蜂、紫胶虫等，昆虫研究所对这些益虫，有的正在进行调查研究，有的已完成了调查研究工作。
    常听说虫子寄生在植物上，但也有相反情况。一种“真菌”（微生物）寄生在一种幼虫身上，虫子死后，在虫子的头部长出小草。这就是主治虚症的中药“冬虫夏草”。这种药草生长在海拔三千到四千米以上的康藏高原草甸地带（只长草不长乔木灌木的地带），只有野生，没有家种。当地人民采集这种药物的时候很辛苦，需要匐伏在地上，用嘴吹开草丛，仔细找寻。过去对它的生长繁殖规律没有人研究过。现在昆虫研究所的一批研究人员正在康藏高原进行调查研究，目的是要使“冬虫夏草”能在海拔三千米以下地区用人工培植，使它能大量生产。
    紫胶虫分泌出来的紫胶在工业上有重要用途。中苏科学工作者合作的紫胶虫研究工作已经完成，现在昆虫学工作者正在指导农民大量发展紫胶生产。
    昆虫学工作者，还在研究蜜蜂的选种工作。
    昆虫区系调查，可以说是昆虫学的基本建设工作，是摸底的工作；调查的内容是昆虫的种类和分布。这项工作，昆虫研究所已经进行了好几年。现在有一批人马在云南调查，另一批和江西农学院合作在新疆调查。过去他们在调查中只是采集标本，对于生产中的实际问题注意得很不够。经过整风运动以后，今年的工作作风有显著改进，在调查中一边采集标本，一边帮助当地人民解决生产中的重要问题。在新疆某些地区作区系调查的人员，今年春天帮助当地农民消灭了桑树害虫“桑尺蠖”，夏季又帮助当地消灭了棉花苗期害虫“地老虎”。
    今年以来，昆虫研究所已有三分之二的工作人员分布在全国许多地区，同当地有关科学部门和生产部门合作，积极进行与生产建设有密切关系的昆虫调查研究工作。（附图片）
