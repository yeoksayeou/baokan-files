　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A Glimpse of the Morning Market
　　Our Reporter Shi Yue'e
　　In the summer, the port of Dalian is shrouded in mist in the early morning, and the buildings and trees on the street seem to be covered with a soft veil. At about four o'clock, the street lamps flicker faintly in the morning mist, but the sound of "squeak...squeak..." pushing a cart comes from Minquan Street. Who is out on the street so early? Isn't this Li Jixing, the salesman who often delivers goods to your door? He's here with a cart of fresh vegetables: Chinese cabbage, leeks, cucumbers, eggplants, tomatoes... Just after Li Jixing's cart passed, Sun Kezhi, the director of the Fourth Department Store, who is very familiar to the residents, also passed by pushing a cart. His cart has various seasonings, household goods, as well as cigarettes, beer... Then, more and more carts of all kinds gather together, and they stop at fixed locations. Before long, an open-air morning market forms here.

　　Female workers on the early shift are the first customers at the morning market. Here, they can buy satisfactory vegetables, and also conveniently fill a thermos of hot water on the "stove," saving them from having to start a fire at home.

　　At this time, the attentive and thoughtful United Barber Shop is already open. If there is time, it is also a good idea to get a haircut in the cool morning.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　People's Stewards
　　Guo Fengzhang, an employee living in the 20th Residents' Committee of Dalian, has a nursing baby. Because the mother has no milk, the baby has to eat condensed milk and milk every day. One morning, the condensed milk ran out, and the baby was crying from hunger. Just as Guo Fengzhang and his wife were worried, Li Renchun, a salesman from the Fifth Department Store, came in with a bottle of condensed milk. He put the condensed milk on the table and said, "This is the condensed milk for your child!" The child saw the bottle of condensed milk and stopped crying.

　　After reading this story, people may say, "What a coincidence!" In fact, this is not an accidental coincidence, but a characteristic of the commercial staff on Minquan Street.

　　Minquan Street is a bustling and lively street. More than 7,000 households with more than 30,000 people live on this street. How to do a good job in supplying goods to so many people is their goal. In April of this year, under the leadership of the Shazhoukou District Committee of the Communist Party of China, they conducted a detailed survey of the needs of residents household by household, and promoted the supply method of "point-to-committee (Residents' Committee), person-to-household" throughout the street, that is, allocating goods according to population, location, and service objects, and each commercial staff member is responsible for contacting about 200 households. Salesmen take turns going outside the counter during the store's spare time to learn about the needs of the masses through door-to-door delivery and rotating visits. These salesmen are not only familiar with the store's commodity business, but also know a lot about the residents' situation. Among the residents that each person is assigned to contact, how many elderly people, how many infants, how many sewing machines, when sewing thread is needed, which baby needs condensed milk on which day, which family does not eat scaleless fish, which families like to eat leeks... they know these situations relatively clearly. Delivering condensed milk to Guo Fengzhang is just one example of them delivering goods to their door.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　"Pre-Order Sales" Box
　　Residents living on Minquan Street, anyone who cannot go to the street to buy things, just write a note, write down their name, address, and the name and quantity of the goods needed, and put it in the "Pre-Order Sales" box specially set up by the store. The salesmen open the box twice a day at regular intervals, and deliver the goods needed by the residents that the store has to the residents' homes during the store's spare time.

　　The service target of the "Pre-Order Sales" box is very clear, mainly residents who cannot go to the street to buy goods. In the residents' survey, they found that there were a total of 1,849 households in need of goods but without anyone to go to the street to buy them. In addition to the elderly, young, sick, disabled, and weak, most of them are couples who are both employees and have no one to take care of housework. In the past, because these people did not have time or could not go to the street, many daily necessities were often not supplied. In order to take care of the reasonable needs of this part of the residents, the commercial department decided to set up 33 "Pre-Order Sales" boxes in employee residential areas and streets, and give priority to meeting the needs of the elderly, young, sick, disabled, and weak in terms of the types and quantities of goods needed; couples who are both employees can also get the same care. The establishment of the "Pre-Order Sales" box has allowed the masses who have not been able to eat fresh vegetables for a long time to eat vegetables, and the masses who cannot go to the street are equivalent to going to the street themselves. Tang's mother, who lives at No. 35 Jiefang Building, wrote a letter asking for one yuan of fine noodle snacks. After Li, the director of the Second Department Store, paid a visit, he immediately returned to the department store and sent the fine noodle snacks. Jin Shuqin, a housewife who has been paralyzed in bed for many years, wanted to buy a piece of cloth. This stumped the salesman. Who knew what color and pattern she liked? The salesman Zhang Yuhua simply brought several kinds of cloth and took them to her bedside for her to choose.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　New Department Store, New People
　　Recently, on the outer wall of a bungalow in the Qunzhong (Masses) Road courtyard on Anshan Road, a red paper with black characters was conspicuously posted, with the words "Masses Service Station" written on it. This is a comprehensive commodity service station, and the salesman is Cao Da Niang, a housewife without culture, who is in her forties this year. She sells more than 60 kinds of goods, and her daily turnover is more than 30 yuan. However, since the service station opened, she has never made a mistake. Her service attitude is kind and considerate, and she has been praised by her neighbors.

　　This Masses courtyard houses 126 worker families. The courtyard is several miles away from the supply point. They don't know when the store's goods arrive, and they often go to the street in vain when there are no goods. The masses have many opinions. This courtyard is within the supply range of the Second Department Store. Li Zhiyi, the director of the department store, would carry a load to deliver goods to them whenever he had time. However, because the department store was short of staff, he could not go every day. Therefore, he had discussed with the cadres of the Residents' Committee to establish a supply point. But they couldn't find a suitable salesman, and the housing couldn't be solved either. Later, Cao Da Niang learned about this matter, and she volunteered to be a salesman, and was even willing to vacate one of the three rooms that her family of seven had to open a department store.

　　On June 20th, the "Masses Service Station" officially opened to the public, and everyone was especially happy that the store was opened at the doorstep of the masses. Therefore, on the first day of business, the door was especially crowded, with bustling crowds. Some wanted fresh vegetables, some wanted pickles, and some wanted sundries. The workers on the early shift came to buy cigarettes. Under the leadership of Director Li, she was not flustered in the face of the battle, and greeted customers in an orderly manner. She was just a little slower, but there was no mistake at all. Now, Cao Da Niang can completely handle the business on her own. This new recruit in the commercial team is progressing really fast!

    “方便街”
    本报记者　史越峨
                    早市一瞥
    夏天，大连港的早晨，烟雾缭绕，街道上的建筑物、树木像披上了轻柔的面纱。大约四点钟光景，路灯在晨雾里闪着淡淡的光芒，民权街上却传来了“吱?…吱?…”推小车的声音。是谁一大早就上街了呢，这不是经常送货上门的营业员李吉星吗？他推着一车新鲜的蔬菜来了，大白菜、韭菜、黄瓜、茄子、番茄……李吉星的车子刚走过，居民们最熟悉的第四门市部主任孙克志也推着车子走过来了。在他的小车上有各种调味品，家庭日用百货，还有香烟、啤酒……。接着，各式各样的小车越聚越多，它们分别停在固定的地点。不多久，这儿就形成了一个露天早市。
    上早班的女职工们，是早市的第一批顾客。在这里，她们买到了称心的蔬菜，还可以顺便在“炉灶”上灌一瓶开水，免得回家生火炉。
    这时，殷勤周到的联合理发馆早已开门了，如果时间来得及，也不妨趁早晨凉爽的时刻理个发。
                   群众的管家人
    住在大连第二十居民委员会的职工郭风章，有一个吃奶的孩子，因为妈妈没有奶，天天要吃炼乳和牛奶。一天清晨，炼乳吃完了，孩子饿得直哭。郭风章夫妻正在着急的时候，第五门市部的营业员李仁春拿着一瓶炼乳进门来了。他把炼乳放在桌上说：“这是你们孩子的炼乳！”孩子看到了炼乳瓶，再不哭闹了。
    看了这个故事以后，人们可能会说：“真巧啊！”其实，这并不是偶然的巧合，而是民权街商业工作人员的特色。
    民权街是一条繁华、热闹的大街。这条街上住了七千多户三万多人。如何做好这么多人的商品供应工作，这是他们努力的目标。今年4月，他们在中共沙河口区委的领导下，对居民的需要逐户进行了细致的调查，并在整个街道推行了“以点包会（居民委员会），以人包户”的供应方法，即按人口、地段、服务对象，划供应点分配商品，每个商业工作人员分段负责联系二百户左右的居民。营业员们趁门市空隙时间，轮流到柜台外去活动，通过送货上门，轮流访问等方法，了解群众的需要。这些营业员不仅对门市部的商品业务很熟悉，即使居民的情况，他们也了解很多。在每个人分工联系的居民当中，有多少老人，多少婴儿，多少缝纫机，什么时候需要圈线，那一个婴孩那天要炼乳，那家不吃无鳞鱼，那些人家爱吃韭菜……这些情况，他们了解得都比较清楚。给郭风章送炼乳的事情，只不过是他们把商品送上门的例子中的一个。
                “预约售货”箱
    住在民权街上的居民，凡是无法上街买东西的人，只要写一张条子，上面写明姓名、地址和需要的商品名称、数量，投放在商店专门设立的
  “预约售货”箱内，营业员每天定期开箱两次，趁门市部空隙时间，把居民需要而门市部有的商品，送到居民家里来。
      “预约售货”箱的服务对象十分明确，主要是不能上街购货的居民。在居民调查工作中，他们发现需要商品而无人上街购货的困难户共一千八百四十九户，其中除了老、幼、病、残、弱五类户外，绝大部分是夫妻两人都是职工、无人料理家务。过去，这些人因为没有时间或不能上街，许多日用品常常供应不到。为了照顾这部分居民的合理需要，商业部门决定在职工住宅区和街头巷尾设立了三十三个“预约售货”箱，对老幼病残弱需要的商品品种和数量，尽量优先满足供应；夫妻都是职工的户，也可以得到同等的照顾。“预约售货”箱的建立，使得长期吃不到新鲜蔬菜的群众吃到了蔬菜，无法上街的群众等于自己上了街。住在解放大楼三十五号的唐家妈妈，来信要一元钱细面点心，第二门市部李主任登门拜访之后，就立刻回门市部把细面点心送去。长年瘫痪卧床不起的家庭妇女金淑琴要买一块布，这可把营业员难住了，谁知她欢喜什么颜色，什么花样呢？营业员张玉华干脆抱了好几种布，拿到她的床边，让她自己挑选。新门市部新的人
    最近，在鞍山路群众大院的一座平房外墙上，十分显眼地贴了一张红底黑字的纸条，上面写着：“群众服务站”。这是一个综合性商品服务站，营业员是没有文化的家庭妇女曹大娘，今年四十多岁了。她经营的商品有六十多种，每天的营业额都在三十元以上，可是，自从服务站开业以来，却从未出过一次差错。她的服务态度和蔼周到，得到邻里们的好评。
    这个群众大院住着一百二十六户工人家庭，大院离供应点有好几里路远，商店到货的时候，他们不知道，无货上街常常扑空、群众意见纷纷。这个大院属第二门市部供应范围，门市部主任李治一有空就挑担给他们送货，但是因为门市部人手不足，不能天天去，因此，他曾和居民委员会干部商量建立一个供应点。可是找不到合适的营业员，而且，房子也没法解决。后来，这事被曹大娘知道了，她就自告奋勇担任营业员，而且还愿意把一家七口仅有的三间住房，腾出一间来开设门市部。
    6月20日，“群众服务站”正式对外营业了，商店开到了群众家门口，大家特别欢喜。因此第一天营业，门外特别拥挤，熙熙攘攘的人群，有的要鲜菜，有的要酱菜，有的要杂品，上早班的工人都来买香烟。她在李主任的带领下，临阵不乱，有条有理地招呼顾客，只是动作稍慢了一些，但丝毫没出差错。现在，曹大娘已经完全可以独当一面经营业务了。这个商业队伍里的新兵，进步真快啊！
