Xinhua News Agency, 12th - The national electric power industry system is vigorously grasping electric power industrial production in August and September, further carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and ensuring the electricity needed by various industrial sectors in the new production upsurge.

The general requirements put forward by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power to various enterprises in this campaign are: overcome the right-leaning slack mood of some cadres, continue to exert full energy, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously carry out technological revolution, deeply implement the policy of "ensuring safe production, generating (electricity) more and using (electricity) less, supplying (electricity) more and losing (electricity) less," further strengthen enterprise management, and leap the electric power industrial production to a new level.

This year, China's electric power industry has achieved great results on the basis of the great leap forward last year. From January to July this year, the national power generation increased by 52.5% compared with the same period last year. There has also been significant progress in the completion of various economic and technical indicators. Three-fifths of the power plants nationwide have significantly reduced their plant electricity consumption and coal consumption in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year; the utilization hours of thermal power generating equipment nationwide have also increased by 30% in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year. However, while achieving these results, some cadres have insufficient understanding of the current situation of continued leap forward in industrial production. They saw that the tension in electricity supply in some areas has eased, and they have developed a sense of complacency and relaxation; some cadres overemphasized objective difficulties and relaxed enterprise management and technical management, resulting in poor completion of production tasks, and more power generation and transmission accidents than before.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has recently held consecutive meetings to criticize and review this newly growing right-leaning slack mood, believing that this mood will affect the continued leap forward of the electric power industry and the production of electricity-consuming departments. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power requires all enterprises to deeply examine this harmful ideological mood with the spirit of continuous revolution, and at the same time, grasp the current favorable situation of the new upsurge in industrial production and the rapid increase in electricity demand, comprehensively arrange work, clarify the main attack direction, and eliminate weak links.

In order to fully supply the electricity needed by various industrial sectors in the new production upsurge, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has recently formulated eight measures: strengthen comprehensive balance work to overcome various contradictions that have arisen after generating and supplying more electricity; strengthen the anti-accident struggle, requiring all units to eliminate ten frequently occurring accidents; save coal consumption; rationally use reservoirs to maximize the economic benefits of reservoir water power; do a good job in adjusting load, saving electricity, and unified maintenance; continue to consolidate and improve the work of increasing the output of power generating equipment; prepare for the commissioning of new plants and new equipment; and strengthen the economic accounting system.

### 力争生产新高潮中电力充足　水利电力部制定八项措施保证多发电

　　力争生产新高潮中电力充足
　　水利电力部制定八项措施保证多发电
    新华社12日讯　全国电力工业系统正在大抓8、9月份电力工业生产，进一步开展增产节约运动，保证各工业部门在生产新高潮中所需要的电力。
    水利电力部在这个运动中对各企业提出的总要求是：克服部分干部中的右倾松劲情绪，继续鼓足干劲，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，深入贯彻“确保安全生产，多发（电）少用（电），多供（电）少损（电）”的方针，进一步加强企业管理，把电力工业生产跃进到新的水平。
    今年我国电力工业在去年大跃进的基础上又取得了很大成绩，今年1月至7月份，全国发电量比去年同期增长了52.5％。各项经济技术指标完成情况也有显著进步，全国有五分之三的发电厂上半年厂用电和煤耗，都比去年同期有很大降低；全国火力发电设备的利用小时，上半年也比去年同期增加了30％。但是在取得这些成绩的同时，有一部分干部对当前工业生产继续跃进的形势认识不足，他们看到某些地区电力供应紧张的情况有所缓和，便产生了自满松劲情绪；有的干部过分强调客观困难，放松了企业管理和技术管理，生产任务完成得不够好，发电和送电事故也较前增多。
    水利电力部最近连续召开会议，批判和检查了这种新滋长的右倾松劲情绪，认为这种情绪会影响电力工业的继续跃进，影响用电部门的生产。水利电力部要求各企业必须以不断革命的精神，深入检查这种有害的思想情绪，同时要把握住当前工业生产新高潮、用电需要急剧增长的有利形势，全面安排工作，明确主攻方向，消灭薄弱环节。
    为了充分供应各工业部门在生产新高潮中需要的电力，水利电力部最近制订了八项措施：加强综合平衡工作，克服多发多供电以后出现的各种矛盾；加强反事故斗争，要求各单位消灭十种频发性事故；节约用煤；合理运用水库，使水库的水力发挥最大的经济效益；做好调整负荷、节约用电和统一检修工作；继续巩固提高发电设备出力的工作；做好新厂新设备投入生产的准备工作；加强经济核算制度。（附图片）
