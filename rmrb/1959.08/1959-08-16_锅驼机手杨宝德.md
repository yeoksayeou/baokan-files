    Boiler-Tractor Operator Yang Baode

    The scorching sun made the earth almost scalding hot. Yang Baode, a young man from Kongjiaguo Village in Yancheng County, Henan Province, was inspecting his beloved boiler-tractor amidst the dense autumn fields.

    Yang Baode is a militia member of the company and is only eighteen years old this year. He is also a novice at operating boiler-tractors. In this fight against drought, the commune transferred a boiler-tractor that had just been transported back from the steel factory to Kongjiaguo Farm, and the task of driving the machine was assigned to Yang Baode. He and militia member Zhu Yuqing were responsible for installing the machine. To repair the machine, without tools, they used the set of wrenches and pliers used to repair waterwheels instead. In this way, they quickly installed a boiler-tractor. However, the oil baffle was still leaking oil, and the intake pipe and many other places were leaking air. Without asbestos thread or asbestos board, the machine still could not be used. The drought was getting worse every day, and Baode was worried when he looked at the silent boiler-tractor. "Seeing the crops drying up day by day, what should I do?" As he was thinking, he suddenly saw a small piece of oiled cloth used to wrap screws. An idea flashed in his mind: "Let's try using it!" So, he used the oiled cloth instead of asbestos board. Replacing with oiled cloth was not enough, so he used red oil paint instead of drill oil. In several places where asbestos thread should have been used, cotton strips were used instead. Finally, the cotton strips were used up, but the cylinder was still leaking air, so he simply tore off his cloth hatband and wrapped it around. The machine was repaired, but he couldn't buy engine oil, so he discussed it with everyone and changed to using melted yellow grease instead. This made the machine run.

    Yang Baode fought day and night, eating and living next to the boiler-tractor for ten consecutive days. Sometimes, when the machine broke down and couldn't be repaired immediately, he wouldn't even eat until the machine was restored. The cadres of the farm repeatedly advised him to go back and rest for a while, but before long, he would secretly run back again.

    Yang Baode fought with such tenacious spirit. In eight days, he irrigated more than 150 mu of autumn fields, fully demonstrating the role of boiler-tractors in the fight against drought. (Fan Yongzhong)

    锅驼机手杨宝德
    灼热的阳光，晒得土地有些烫人。河南郾城县空家郭村年青的小伙子杨宝德，正在茂密的秋田中间检修他那部心爱的锅驼机。
    杨宝德是基干连的民兵，今年刚刚十八岁，开锅驼机，还是新手。在这次抗旱斗争中，公社把刚从钢铁厂运回的一部锅驼机调给了空家郭农场，驾驶机器的任务就交给了杨宝德。他同民兵朱玉卿负责安装这部机器。装修机器，没有工具，就用修水车的那套扳子、钳子来代替，这样，很快就把一部锅驼机安装起来了。可是，挡油板还漏油，进气管和许多地方还跑气，没有石棉线和石棉板，机器还是不能用。天越来越旱了，宝德望着那部不吭不响的锅驼机，直是发愁。“眼看着庄稼一天天的旱下去，怎么办呢？”他想着想着，忽然看见眼前放的包螺丝的一块小油布，灵机一动：“就用它来试试看！”于是，他便用油布代替石棉板。垫上油布还不行，又用红油漆代替钻油来使用。有几处该用石棉线的地方，都用棉布条代替，最后棉布条也用完了，可是气缸还漏气，他就顺手扯下自己的布帽带给缠上了。机器修好了，却又买不来机油，他就同大家研究，改用黄油溶化开来用，这才使机器转动起来。
    杨宝德日夜战斗，一连十几天吃住在锅驼机旁。有时，机器出故障，一时修不好，他就连饭也不吃，一直到机器恢复才吃饭。场里的干部三番五次地劝他回去休息一会，可是，没多久，他又偷偷跑回来。
    杨宝德就是用这样的顽强精神战斗着。八天当中，共浇秋田一百五十多亩，充分发挥锅驼机在抗旱中的作用。　（范永忠）
