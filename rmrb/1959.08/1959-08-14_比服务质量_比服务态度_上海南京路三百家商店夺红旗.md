　　Competing on Service Quality, Competing on Service Attitude
　　300 Stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai Vie for the Red Flag
    (Our report) Shanghai's Nanjing Road, with over 300 stores, has recently launched a fervent campaign in the socialist competition movement within the commercial system. They are striving through August and September to improve market supply and service, welcoming National Day with enthusiasm. Many famous stores are actively implementing measures, developing their unique business characteristics, increasing the variety of goods, improving service quality and attitude, and beautifying window displays. This bustling thoroughfare, a commercial hub in Shanghai, stretching across Huangpu and Xincheng districts, is showing an increasingly new face and a revitalized spirit.

    The largest department store on Nanjing Road, the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, is currently expanding its variety of goods with a fighting spirit. Under the leadership of the Party Secretary, specialized personnel have been dispatched to 26 provinces and cities across the country, as well as suburban counties, to procure goods. Currently, the store offers 45,700 types of merchandise. The employees of Wing On Company are striving to promote the store's characteristics of dealing in "high-end, new, special (special specifications), and small" commodities. Recently, the store has introduced singlets with counts of 84 and 100, high-quality shirts with counts of 100 and 150, and high-grade glassware for vehicles. New products are constantly emerging, such as embroidered women's shirts and chrysanthemum-brand fine-mesh singlets with counts of 100.

    The Beijing Cuiwen Zhai, a store on West Nanjing Road renowned for its Muslim food products, has recently established a variety research group specifically to improve the flavor and appearance of pastries. Traditional Beijing delicacies like "Small Eight Pieces" and "Fuling Cake," which had been discontinued for many years, have gradually resumed production. They also plan to add 90 new varieties in August and September to welcome National Day. Shirt workers at the Wuxiang Department Store factory are utilizing their expertise to carefully design many novel and attractive new shirt styles. One evening, they designed eleven styles, which were well received by consumers after production. Photography studios along the street, such as China, International, Wuxiang, and Guangyi, are actively training personnel in photography, developing, printing, and coloring, exchanging technical experiences, and improving photo quality to enable more customers to capture good photos during the National Day holiday.

    In the competition to learn from and surpass advanced units, the service quality of employees has also greatly improved. Following a conference in mid-July in Huangpu District focused on exchanging advanced experiences centered around the stores on East Nanjing Road, employees in various stores launched a wave of learning from the advanced. A certain singlet from the Nanyang Socks Factory, printed with the word "Shanghai," was selling well. Based on the experiences shared at the meeting, sales staff researched and discovered that most of the buyers were customers from other places who were buying them as souvenirs. They contacted the factory to increase the production of this type of product. At the recent conference of commercial worker representatives in Xincheng District, some good examples from stores on West Nanjing Road were also introduced.

    At the same time, stores are also paying attention to beautifying window displays. The vast majority of stores have a fresh new look. The window displays of Zhongbai No. 1 Store, Wing On Company, Nanyang Socks Factory, Wuxiang Department Store, Lantang Leather Shoes Store, and Fuli Silk Fabric Store, among others, are novel and unique, each with its own characteristics, fully demonstrating a prosperous and vibrant scene, adding a lot of new vitality to the entire Nanjing Road.

    Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Overcome Right-leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Practice Increasing Production and Practicing Economy," the employees of various stores on Nanjing Road have, through study and discussion, expressed their determination to welcome National Day with even greater enthusiasm. Employees of Huaxin Department Store, in order to launch a competition upsurge, have issued a proposal to all department stores in Huangpu District, calling for vigorous efforts in August and September. They guarantee to develop the original characteristics of rainwear and clothing, and recently added 20 new varieties of special specifications, aiming to "have a wide variety of styles and new specifications that please everyone, whether thin, fat, tall, or short." At the same time, they will ensure that the vast majority of salespeople reach excellent standards before National Day. Employees of Huadong Leather Shoe Store will also increase the August leather shoe production by another 30% on top of the original plan.

　　比服务质量　比服务态度
　　上海南京路三百家商店夺红旗
    本报讯　上海市南京路上三百多家商店，最近在商业系统社会主义竞赛运动中，掀起了一个奋战8、9两月，做好市场供应和服务工作，迎接国庆节的热潮。许多著名商店积极采取施措，发扬经营特色，增加花色品种，提高服务质量，改进服务态度，美化橱窗布置。这条处在上海商业中心，横贯黄浦、新成两区的热闹大街，面貌日益更新，精神格外焕发。
    南京路上最大的第一百货商店最近全体职工正以战斗姿态扩大花色品种。目前，在党委书记主持下，已派出专人到全国二十六个省、市和市郊各县采购商品；目前经营品种已达四万五千七百种。永安公司职工们正在努力发扬该店经营“高（高档）、新（新产品）、特（特种规格）、小（小商品）”商品的特色。最近商场已出现了八十四支、一百支的汗衫，一百支、一百五十支的高级衬衫，和车料的高级玻璃器皿。新产品也是层出不穷，如绣花女衬衫、一百支菊花牌细眼汗背心等。
    南京西路上以经营清真食品著称的北京翠文斋，最近成立了花色品种研究小组，专门研究改进糕点的色香味，断档多年的细小八件、茯苓饼等北京名点，目前都已陆续恢复生产。他们还计划在8、9月份内增加九十种新品种迎接国庆节。万象百货商店工场的衬衫工人发挥特长，精心设计了许多式样新颖、漂亮大方的新衬衫。有一个晚上，就设计了十一种，制成后深受消费者欢迎。这条街上的中国、国际、万象、光艺等照像馆，为了让更多的顾客在国庆佳节拍到好照，正在积极培训摄影、洗印、着色等人才，交流技术经验，提高照像质量。
    在学先进、比先进的竞赛运动中，职工们的服务质量也有很大提高。黄浦区在7月中旬召开了以南京东路各商店为中心的先进经验交流会后，各店职工展开了学先进的热潮。南洋袜厂有一种印有“上海”字样的汗衫很好销，营业员根据会上经验，加以研究，发现多是外地来上海的顾客，买回去做纪念的。他们就与工厂联系，增加了这一类产品。新成区最近的商业职工代表会议上，也介绍了南京西路上商店的一些好事例。
    与此同时，各商店还重视美化橱窗商品陈列工作，绝大多数商店面貌一新。中百一店、永安公司、南洋袜厂、万象百货店、蓝棠皮鞋店、富丽绸布店等商店橱窗布置，都新颖别致，各具特色，充分显示了繁荣活跃的景象，给整个南京路增加不少新气象。
    自人民日报发表了“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论后，南京路上各商店职工通过学习讨论，又纷纷表示要以更大干劲来迎接国庆。华新百货商店职工为了掀起一个竞赛高潮，已向全黄浦区百货商店发出倡议书，在8、9两月鼓足干劲，大干一场，他们保证发扬原有雨衣服装经营特色，最近增加特殊规格新品种二十种，做到“花色大路规格新，瘦胖长短皆欢喜”，同时要在国庆前做到绝大多数的营业员达到优秀的标准。华东皮鞋店职工也将8月份皮鞋产量在原计划上再加30％。
