Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Currently, drought is occurring in areas south of the Yellow River and in the Yangtze and Huai River basins, while there is excessive rain in parts of North and Northeast China. Why is this phenomenon occurring, and what is its future trend? To this end, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Central Meteorological Bureau.

The person in charge of the Meteorological Bureau said that the occurrence of drought and excessive rain in some parts of China this summer is mainly due to the strong and northerly location of the Pacific high pressure, causing the main rain belt to jump over the Jianghuai area and frequently remain in the North China and southern Northeast China area. The current drought is widespread and of considerable intensity. Areas north of the Nanling and Wuyi Mountains, and south of the Guanzhong Plain and the lower reaches of the Yellow River (including Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Zhejiang provinces and parts of Fujian and Guangxi), have experienced drought since early July. Rainfall in these areas is generally low in July. The total rainfall in the middle and upper reaches of the Han River and Huai River, the Guanzhong Plain, and the eastern Sichuan Basin in July was only 20 to 50 millimeters, and only about 10 millimeters around Dongting Lake, which is 40% to 90% less than the same period in normal years. According to the water demand of crops, the amount needed at this time is generally around 100 to 150 millimeters. Due to the extreme lack of rain, the drought is particularly prominent except in areas along rivers and irrigation districts. This is a relatively severe drought that has occurred in the area south of the Yellow River since liberation. It is very similar in scope and severity to the six severe droughts that occurred in the thirty-four years from 1925 to 1958. Those six severe droughts occurred in 1928, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1942, and 1944, and the drought period generally lasted for three months.

Before June this year, the drought areas were concentrated in Hebei and the three northeastern provinces north of the Yellow River. The total rainfall in these areas from January to June was about 90 to 150 millimeters, which was about 20% to 40% less than the same period in normal years. Since July, due to the sudden northward shift of the main rain belt to the North China and southern Northeast China area, the drought in most of the original area has been relieved. Rainfall in the northern part of North China and southern Northeast China is relatively concentrated. The daily rainfall in Beijing on July 30 and Hohhot on July 26 both exceeded the highest daily rainfall recorded in local history, and floods occurred in some areas.

This large-scale drought and excessive rain in some areas are closely related to the intensity and location of the Pacific high pressure and the operation of major air currents in the high altitude. Judging from the airflow patterns, in normal years, the area south of the Yangtze River enters the plum rain season in mid-June. At this time, the warm air currents from the Pacific Ocean reach the sky above the Yangtze River, and the area south of the Yangtze River is where cold and warm air currents meet. This year is different from previous years. After the Pacific warm air current extended into the sky above South China in early June, it was slow to move northward. Heavy rain occurred in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi and other regions, while the plum rain season in the area south of the Yangtze River had very little rain. After early July, this warm air current quickly moved northward, jumping over the Jianghuai River basin and extending directly into the sky above North China, resulting in sparse rainfall in most parts of the Jianghuai River basin since July, causing drought. In contrast, North China and southern Northeast China are located on the line where the Siberian cold air current and the Pacific warm air current meet. Whenever a low pressure passes through, there will be heavy rain or rainstorms. Since July, low pressure has frequently passed through North China, so there has been rainfall on average every three to five days. At present, this form of airflow operation is still maintained, thus causing excessive rain in northern China, mainly in the northern part of North China and parts of southeastern Inner Mongolia.

According to the analysis and research of existing meteorological data by the Central Meteorological Bureau, this abnormal distribution of rainfall is expected to continue in mid- and late August. Drought resistance in Jianghuai area and flood prevention work in North China, Inner Mongolia and other places cannot be relaxed. In addition, according to the Meteorological Bureau's forecast, there may be one or two typhoons each in August and September, and coastal areas should also pay attention to typhoon prevention work.

### 今年为什么发生旱涝现象？　今后一个时期的趋势如何？ 中央气象局负责人答记者问

　　今年为什么发生旱涝现象？
　　今后一个时期的趋势如何？
　　中央气象局负责人答记者问
    新华社11日讯　当前黄河以南、长江和淮河流域等地区发生旱象，而华北、东北部分地区又多雨，为什么会产生这种现象，它的未来趋势如何？为此记者访问了中央气象局负责人。
    气象局负责人说，今年夏季我国部分地区发生旱象和多雨现象，主要是由于太平洋高气压较强，纬度偏北，主要降雨带跃过江淮地区，经常停留在华北、东北南部一带所致。当前干旱范围较广，强度亦较大。南岭和武夷山以北，关中盆地和黄河下游以南地区（包括陕西、河南、山东、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南、四川、贵州、浙江等省和福建、广西部分地区），从7月上旬起相继发生旱象。这一地区7月降雨量一般都较少。汉水、淮河中上游和关中盆地、四川盆地东部7月全月雨量仅有二十到五十毫米，洞庭湖一带仅有十毫米左右，较常年同期少四成到九成。按农作物的需水量，此时一般都在一百到一百五十毫米左右，由于雨水奇缺，除沿江河及灌溉地区外，干旱显得特别突出。这是解放以来，黄河以南地区发生的较严重的一次干旱。与历史上1925年到1958年的三十四年间发生的六次严重干旱相比较，干旱的范围和程度极相似。那六次严重干旱发生在1928、1932、1934、1935、1942、1944年，旱期一般都长达三个月。
    今年6月以前，干旱地区集中在黄河以北的河北和东北三省。这些地区1月到6月的总降雨量在九十到一百五十毫米左右，比常年同期少二成到四成左右。从7月开始，由于主要雨带突然北移到华北、东北南部一带，原来这个地区的干旱大部解除。华北北部和东北南部一带雨量比较集中，北京7月30日、呼和浩特7月26日的日雨量都超出了当地历史记载最高日雨量，部分地区发生了涝情。
    这次大范围的干旱和部分地区多雨，是和太平洋高气压的强度、位置以及高空主要气流的运行有很大关系。从气流运行情况看，正常年份到了6月中旬，江南一带就进入梅雨期，这时太平洋上的暖气流抵达长江两岸上空，江南便是冷暖空气交绥的地方。今年与往年不同，太平洋暖气流6月上旬伸入华南上空以后，迟迟不向北移，广东、广西、福建、江西等地区发生暴雨，而长江以南一带的梅雨季节却下雨很少。7月上旬以后，这个暖气流又迅速向北推进，一下跳跃过江淮流域直伸入华北上空，致使江淮大部地区7月以来降雨零星稀少，酿成旱象。与此相反，华北地区和东北南部，由于处在西伯利亚冷气流和太平洋暖气流的交绥线上，每当有低气压过境，就有大雨或暴雨出现。7月以来，华北地区低气压过境频繁，因而平均三五天就有一次降雨。到目前，这种气流运行的形势还保持着，因而使我国北方，主要是华北北部和内蒙古东南部部分地区多雨。
    中央气象局根据对现有气象资料的分析研究，认为目前这种雨量的反常分布情况，8月中、下旬还要继续维持，江淮等地的抗旱和华北、内蒙古等地的防汛工作不能放松。此外，根据气象局的预测，8、9两月还可能各有一、二次台风，沿海地区的预防台风工作也要注意。
