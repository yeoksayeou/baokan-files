    "Living" Cultivation of Crops
    Wang Zugao

    The People's Daily reported on July 16th that Jishan County in Shanxi Province had achieved a bumper wheat harvest. The news stated that this year's total output increased by 64.6% compared to last year, and the per-mu yield increased by 92.9% compared to last year. The reason Jishan County was able to achieve such great results was primarily due to the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture in accordance with local conditions. In their own vernacular, it was "living cultivation of crops." This "living" character, both concise and vivid, reveals a simple yet profound truth.

    Doing everything "live" is not so simple. Take close planting in agricultural production, for example. Didn't some people disregard specific circumstances and propose that the denser the better? In April and May of this year, when I went to the countryside, I saw wheat sowing rates as high as 800 jin per mu. This is very different from the "five observations" close planting plan proposed by Jishan County in Shanxi Province. The "living" character means being practical and realistic. To "live" cultivate crops, we must get rid of subjectivism and adopt cultivation measures tailored to local conditions based on the specific conditions of different natural conditions, climatic conditions, farming habits, and other specific circumstances. This is the only way to establish agricultural production on a solid and reliable foundation. If we do not proceed from reality, regardless of whether it is on the plains, in the hills, or in the mountains, and issue tasks uniformly without regard to actual conditions, it will lead to losses.

    Cultivating crops is like this, and we should do all our work like this. If we don't do this, it will not conform to the objective laws of things, and we will encounter setbacks. The socialist cause we are undertaking is an unprecedented and extremely great cause, and all aspects of work lack experience. This requires us to explore and摸索(mōsuǒ - grope/feel). As long as we adhere to the principle that everything must be tested, proceed from the actual situation, and "live" do things realistically, that is, act according to objective laws, it will promote the leaping progress of our cause.

    To do things "live," the most important thing is to be good at following the mass line and discussing things with the masses. It is also necessary to be good at investigation and research, grasp the essence of things, that is, grasp the contradictions of things, through "live" practice, and then analyze and research, and raise it to principles. This is the only way to correctly solve problems and do things well.

### “活”种庄稼

    “活”种庄稼
    汪祖高
    人民日报7月16日报道了山西省稷山县小麦获得大丰收的消息。消息里说今年总产量比去年提高了64.6％，亩产比去年提高92.9％。稷山县之所以能取得这样大的成绩，主要是因地制宜地贯彻了农业八字宪法，用他们自己通俗的话来说，那就是“活种庄稼”。这个既概括又形象的一个“活”字，道出了一条平凡而又深刻的真理。
    一切事情要“活”做，并不是那么简单的。就拿农业生产中的密植来说吧，有些人不是不看具体情况，提出越密越好吗，在今年4、5月里，我下乡就看到小麦下籽量高到每亩八百斤的。这与山西稷山县提的“五看”的密植方案大为不同。“活”字就是实事求是的意思，要“活”种庄稼，就必须摆脱主观主义，根据各地不同的自然条件、气候条件、耕作习惯等具体情况，因地制宜地采取耕作措施，才能使农业生产建立在切实可靠的基础上。如果不从实际出发，不管是在平原，是在丘陵地带，或者是在山区，千篇一律下达任务，不合实际情况，就会招致损失。
    种庄稼是如此，我们做任何工作都该如此，不如此就不符合事物的客观规律，就要碰钉子。我们进行的社会主义事业，是前无古人的极其伟大的事业，各项工作都缺乏经验，这就要求我们去探讨，去摸索，只要我们坚持一切经过试验的原则，从实际情况出发，实事求是地去“活”办事，也就是根据客观规律去办事，就会促进我们的事业飞跃前进。
    事情要“活”做，最重要的一条就是要善于走群众路线，有事和群众商量。还要善于调查研究，抓住事物的本质，也就是抓住事物的矛盾，通过“活”的实践，然后分析研究，提高到原则上来，这样才能正确地解决问题，把事情办好。
