Xinhua News Agency, 4th. In recent days, a cluster of artistic flowers of dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental performances has blossomed on the capital's stage. Excellent programs from more than ten ethnic groups in eight provinces and autonomous regions—Tibet, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui—are competing to shine in the capital's performance. This performance was held by the Ministry of Culture at the end of July to further promote the creation of dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental works, and to study and improve artistic quality. Vice Premier Chen Yi watched the performance and had cordial conversations with the performers. On August 2nd, the performers gave a farewell performance to the audience in the capital.

　　The fifty-six programs in this performance are all newly created or have been re-arranged and improved in recent years. The Tibetan dance "Night of Harvest" unfolds a happy and colorful dance from a static picture, expressing the feelings of the Tibetan people: "Let the song hold highland barley wine and dedicate it to our dear Communist Party." Zhejiang's "Tea Picking Dance" is adapted from Yue Opera melodies, with a Jiangnan flavor and graceful dance moves. The Miao dance "Dangga Shu Niu" in Guizhou is created by absorbing the advantages of several different styles of Lusheng dance, vividly showing the grand occasion of the Miao family celebrating the harvest during festivals. The Dai "Ganha Bai Dance" in Yunnan depicts happy young people jumping and immersed in love for the Great Leap Forward during traditional festivals. The Fujian folk dance "Chasing Rain" uses clever and graceful dance steps to express the joyful mood of the commune girls going to the market on holidays and the twists and turns of fighting the wind and rain along the way. The Uyghur "Melon Planting Dance" in Xinjiang gives full play to the characteristics of solo dance, expressing pleasant labor and the joy of harvest. Anhui folk dance "Twelve Handkerchiefs" depicts a group of embroidery girls singing while embroidering, expressing their yearning for a happy life in the future. Other dances include "Spring in the Fishing Port," "Pine Forest Tiger Fight," "Dragon Dance," "Drum Dance," and the Yao "Wedding Dance" in Guangxi, with various themes and forms. Among the solo singing and solo instrumental programs, there are melodious male and female solo performances by famous singers of Uyghur, Tibetan, Miao, Zhuang, Bai, and Han nationalities, as well as the Pipa songs of the Dong nationality, the folk song chorus of the Zhuang nationality, and the mountain songs and opera small concerts of Anhui and Zhejiang. The Kirgiz three-person Komuz singing in Xinjiang, the Wuju music ensemble in Zhejiang, and the Yueqin solo in Fujian all have national and local characteristics.

　　During this performance, the cultural departments, in conjunction with the Chinese Musicians Association and the Chinese Dance Research Association, held several symposiums to discuss how to improve the artistic quality of dance and music and to pay attention to cultivating solo dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental talents in conjunction with the performance programs. Representatives from the music and dance circles in Beijing and Sichuan, Wuhan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Tianjin, Dalian and other places also participated in this observation and discussion.

　　Through this observation and discussion, everyone has a deeper understanding of further implementing the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" literary and artistic policy, improving ideological and artistic quality, and meeting the needs of the people. Everyone believes that the programs in this performance have made significant progress compared with the previous few years. There has been improvement in the combination of ideology and artistry, in the depth of learning folk and classical dance, and in performance techniques. The content and form are also more diversified. Everyone believes that China's professional dance work is a newborn artistic seedling with a thin foundation, and should be vigorously supported and promoted. Dance has a wide range of functions such as educating the masses, inspiring people, understanding the history, life, customs, and habits of all ethnic groups, and enriching people's artistic appreciation. Therefore, the themes, forms, and styles must be diversified. The dance forms should be large, medium, and small, and there should be various forms such as solo dance, duo dance, and group dance. At present, there are very few solo dances and duo dances, and they should be vigorously promoted. Dance dramas can be experimentally created on the solid foundation of folk dance and classical dance and under possible conditions, without blindly seeking large-scale. We must encourage the creation of children's dances, and also pay attention to the creation of square dances to meet the needs of the masses' amateur dance activities. The themes of dance should include new dances reflecting contemporary life, as well as traditional folk dances and classical dances; there should be dances with plots, as well as dances that mainly express the emotions of characters. We must promote the diversification of styles, and a truly good style must have high skills.

　　Regarding the issue of improving the artistic quality of dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental performances, everyone believes that music and dance workers should not only have correct ideas and be good at in-depth observation of life, but also must firmly grasp basic technical training, and learn more deeply from folk and classical music and dance art, and conduct strict training like opera actors. In addition, they must also have literary, artistic and other aspects of accomplishment, in order to continuously enrich and improve performance levels. Everyone believes that solo dance training is an important aspect of improving dance skills, and actors should be trained to be good at using physical movements to express inner thoughts and feelings. The improvement of the level of solo dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental performance can drive the improvement of the overall quality of music and dance art. Composers should work closely with solo dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental performers and compose more music for them. Solo dance, solo singing, and solo instrumental performers should have more training time. Representatives from various places participating in the performance stated that they will work harder in the future, conduct in-depth research, and work more actively to improve the artistic quality of dance and music.

    提高艺术质量　培养歌舞人才
    八省区举行音乐舞蹈汇报演出
    新华社4日讯　近几天，首都舞台上集中开放了一丛舞蹈、独唱、独奏的艺术花朵。西藏、新疆、云南、贵州、广西、浙江、福建、安徽八个省、区十多个民族的优秀节目在首都汇报演出中竞放光彩。这次汇报演出是文化部为了进一步繁荣舞蹈、独唱、独奏的创作，研究提高艺术质量，在7月底举行的。陈毅副总理观看了演出的节目，并且和演员们作了亲切的交谈。8月2日，演员们向首都观众举行了临别公演。
    这次汇报演出的五十六个节目，都是近年来新创作或经过重新整理提高的。西藏舞蹈“丰收之夜”，由静止的画面，展开了幸福多采的舞蹈，表达着藏民的心意：“让歌声捧着青稞酒，献给亲人共产党。”浙江的“采茶舞”，根据越剧曲调改编而成，带有江南风味，舞姿优美。贵州的苗族舞蹈“当嘎抒扭”，吸收了几种不同风格的籚笙舞的优点创作而成，生动地表现苗家节日欢庆丰收的盛况。云南傣族“赶摆舞”，表现了在传统节日里，为大跃进而欢跳和沉浸在爱情中的幸福青年。福建民间舞蹈“赶雨”，运用灵巧优美的舞步，表现公社的姑娘们在假日赶集的欢乐心情和中途与风雨搏斗的曲折情节。新疆维吾尔族的“种瓜舞”，发挥独舞特长，表现愉快的劳动和丰收的喜悦。安徽民间舞蹈“十二条手巾”，描写一群绣花姑娘边绣花边歌唱对未来幸福生活的向往。其他还有“渔港之春”、“松林斗虎”、“龙舞”、“鼓舞”，广西瑶族的“婚礼舞”等各种题材、形式的舞蹈。在独唱、独奏的节目中，有维吾尔族、藏族、苗族、僮族、白族和汉族著名歌手悦耳动听的男女声独唱，有侗族的琵琶歌、僮族的民歌合唱和安徽、浙江的山歌、戏曲小演唱等等。新疆柯尔克孜族的三人考木孜弹唱，浙江的婺剧音乐联奏、福建的月琴独奏等都具有民族和地方特色。
    在这次汇报演出过程中，文化部门协同中国音乐家协会、中国舞蹈研究会分别举行了数次座谈会，结合演出的节目，讨论了如何提高舞蹈、音乐艺术质量和重视培养独舞、独唱、独奏人才的问题。北京和四川、武汉、陕西、甘肃、湖南、天津、旅大等地音乐、舞蹈界也派代表参加了这次的观摩讨论。
    经过这次观摩、讨论，大家对进一步贯彻党的“百花齐放”的文艺方针，提高思想、艺术质量，满足人民群众需要，有了更深刻的体会。大家认为：这次汇报演出的节目，比前几年有了显著进步，在思想性与艺术性的结合方面，在学习民间、古典舞蹈的深度和表演技术方面都有所提高，内容和形式也比较多样化了。大家认为：我国的专业舞蹈工作是新生的艺术幼苗，底子薄，应该大力扶植和提倡。舞蹈有着教育群众，鼓舞人心，了解各族人民历史生活、风俗习惯和丰富人民艺术欣赏等广泛的作用，因此题材、形式、风格必须多样化。舞蹈形式要大、中、小都有，要有单人舞、双人舞、集体舞等各种形式，目前独舞、双人舞非常少，应大力提倡。舞剧可在民间舞和古典舞的深厚基础上和可能的条件下进行实验创造，不要盲目求大。要鼓励创作儿童舞蹈，还要重视广场舞蹈的创作，以满足广大群众业余舞蹈活动的需要。舞蹈题材既要有反映现时生活的新舞蹈，也要有传统的民间舞蹈和古典舞蹈；要有带情节的舞蹈，也要有主要发抒人物情绪的舞蹈。要提倡风格的多样化，而真正好的风格必须具有高度的技巧。
    关于提高舞蹈、独唱、独奏的艺术质量问题，大家认为，音乐、舞蹈工作者不仅要有正确的思想，要善于深入观察生活，同时必须抓紧基本技术训练，更深入地向民间和古典的音乐、舞蹈艺术学习，要像戏曲演员那样进行严格锻炼。另外，还要具有文学、美术等多方面的修养，才能不断丰富提高表演水平。大家认为，独舞的锻炼是提高舞蹈技巧的重要方面，要培养演员善于运用肢体动作表现内心的思想感情。独舞、独唱、独奏水平的提高，可以带动整个音乐、舞蹈艺术质量的提高。作曲家应与独舞、独唱、独奏演员密切合作，多为他们作曲。独舞、独唱、独奏演员应该有较多的锻炼时间。参加汇报演出的各地代表表示，今后要更加勤学苦练，深入钻研，更加积极地为提高舞蹈、音乐的艺术质量而努力。（附图片）
