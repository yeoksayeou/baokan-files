Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 31st. One and a half million Argentine workers are on strike, demanding higher wages and guaranteed livelihoods.

Those involved in the strike include 1.2 million agricultural workers and 200,000 sugar industry workers, as well as grape growers and winemakers. The strike movement is still developing. Construction workers, metallurgical workers, and textile workers have all announced that they will also strike if their demands for wage increases are not met satisfactorily.

The Argentine "Sixty-Two Trade Unions" leadership, in a statement on the state of the national economy issued on the 29th, said that the government intends to fulfill all the conditions put forward by the "International Monetary Fund" in order to obtain disastrous financial aid. This policy is pushing the working masses into hunger and poverty, and further worsening the national economic situation. This large-scale strike is the Argentine workers' response to the recently appointed Minister of Economy and Labor, Alsogaray, considered a "good choice" by Washington figures.

In his televised speech after taking office, this minister requested workers not to demand wage increases on the one hand, and wanted to hand over state-owned enterprises to domestic and foreign monopoly capital for operation on the other hand. He also announced that he would lay off 50,000 state employees.

Alsogaray's measures have been firmly opposed by the Argentine people.

### 反饥饿　争活路  阿根廷150万工人罢工

    反饥饿　争活路
    阿根廷150万工人罢工
    据新华社31日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷一百五十万工人举行罢工，要求增加工资，保证生活。
    卷入这次罢工的包括一百二十万农业工人和二十万糖业工人，还有葡萄种植和酿酒工人等。目前罢工运动还在继续发展。建筑工人、冶金工人和纺织工人都宣布，如他们提出的增加工资的要求不能得到圆满答复，也即将举行罢工。
    阿根廷“六十二工会”领导机构在29日发表的关于国家经济状况的声明说，政府为了取得祸国殃民的财政援助，打算履行“国际货币基金组织”提出的一切条件。这种政策正在把劳动群众推向饥饿和贫困，使国家经济状况更加恶化。这次大规模的罢工，是阿根廷工人对上任不久，被华盛顿人士认为是“良好的选择”的经济兼劳工部长阿耳索加赖的答复。
    这个部长在他上任后的电视演说中曾一面要求工人不要要求增加工资，一面要把国家企业让给国内外垄断资本经营。并宣布即将裁减国家机关雇员五万人。
    阿耳索加赖的这些措施，遭到阿根廷人民的坚决反对。
