The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places have bravely joined the local people in fighting floods and providing disaster relief, making significant contributions.

Since June, some areas in the southeastern coastal provinces have been hit by torrential rains, causing disasters. The People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces immediately dispatched a large number of personnel, vehicles, ships, and aircraft to participate in rescue and relief efforts. According to incomplete statistics, troops in various locations dispatched over 262,000 personnel-times, 435 vehicles, and 123 aircraft, airdropping 206,000 kilograms of relief supplies. In addition, more than 120 ships were dispatched. Troops rescued more than 44,000 disaster victims and 436 head of cattle in various regions, and salvaged 2,717 tons of various supplies. Furthermore, officers and soldiers voluntarily donated more than 44,700 pieces of clothing to help the disaster victims.

In the rescue and relief efforts, the People's Liberation Army undertook the most arduous tasks, demonstrating a spirit of not fearing difficulties for the sake of the people's interests. When Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, Dongguan, and other counties in Guangdong Province suffered severe flood disasters, and the masses were surrounded by floods and cut off from food supplies, the air force immediately dispatched aircraft to airdrop food, clothing, and medicine for relief. The navy also sent a large number of warships and rubber boats to rescue people or transport relief supplies. After the flood entered Huizhou, Major General Hu Jicheng, a commander of a certain unit, personally drove a small boat to direct the rescue work. The officers and soldiers of the guard company of a certain unit fought the flood for four days and nights, enabling more than 2,000 residents of Huizhou to escape danger. Many units also properly resettled the rescued disaster victims. Some vacated barracks and dormitories for the disaster victims to live in; some saved food for the disaster victims to eat; and some soldiers took out their own clothes for the disaster victims to wear. Wei Xiuming, a soldier of a certain anti-aircraft artillery branch, even donated the four pairs of cloth shoes his wife had sent him to the disaster victims. When the Lvsi Fishing Ground in Jiangsu Province was hit by a storm, some fishing boats were stranded in the distant sea, in a very difficult situation. Upon hearing the news, the naval troops immediately dispatched warships and seaplanes, carrying a large amount of food and life-saving equipment, to rush to the rescue, enabling the vast majority of fishermen to quickly escape danger. Under extremely difficult conditions, a certain fleet braved a force 10 gale to rescue seven fishing boats and forty-four fishermen. The sailors took off their own clothes and draped them over the fishermen, and gave their own food to the fishermen.

Troops in various locations also actively assisted the masses in disaster areas to restore production and rebuild their homes. The troops in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong sent more than 500 cadres and medical personnel to form work teams to go deep into the disaster areas to assist local cadres in carrying out rehabilitation work. They helped the masses build more than 450 houses and provided free medical treatment to more than 2,000 disaster victims. This unit also dispatched more than 7,000 officers and soldiers to work with the laborers to repair the Dongjiang Dam, fighting for a bumper harvest of late rice. The people in the disaster area said with emotion: "When we were surrounded by floods, the People's Liberation Army came to rescue us; after the flood receded, they came to help us again. They are truly our own soldiers." They expressed that they must step up production to repay the kindness of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army.

Troops stationed in Fujian, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Hebei, and other places also contributed greatly to flood control and disaster relief. After a reservoir in Jiangcheng Hani Autonomous County, Yunnan, was washed away by floods, officers and soldiers of the garrison ran to the reservoir in the pouring rain, and separately went up the mountain to pry, transport stones, weave bamboo cages, and dredge the river, fighting for nine hours, overcoming the floods, ensuring the lives and safety of the Hani and Yi people in this area, and the crops were not damaged. In the Tangshan area of Hebei Province, it rained heavily for several days, and the Luan River flooded, severely threatening the Luan River Dam. Led by Major Ye Gan, officers and soldiers of the garrison rushed to the Luan River Dam on the morning of July 22 in the rain, fighting from morning until night, protecting the lives and property of the people near the Luan River.

The People's Liberation Army's heroic rescue of the people in the disaster areas gave the people in the disaster areas great encouragement. Whenever the aircraft flew over the disaster area, the disaster victims gathered on the mountain peaks raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" And they wrote letters to the People's Liberation Army, saying: "We must step up production to repay the care and help of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army comrades."

    战洪水一马当先　救灾民奋不顾身
    三军官兵抢险救灾英勇顽强
    本报讯　人民解放军驻广东、广西、福建、浙江等地驻军，奋勇地同当地人民一起参加防汛抢险斗争，作出了重大贡献。
    6月以来，东南沿海各省部分地区暴雨成灾，各地人民解放军陆、海、空军部队立即出动了大批人员、车辆、船只和飞机，参加抢险救灾。据不完全统计，各地部队即出动了官兵二十六万二千多人次、汽车四百三十五台、飞机一百二十三架次，空投了救济物资二十万六千公斤。另外，还出动了船只一百二十多艘。各地区被部队救出的灾民达四万四千多人、耕牛四百三十六条，抢救出各种物资二千七百十七吨。此外，官兵们还自动捐献衣服四万四千七百多件，救济了灾民。
    在抢险救灾中，解放军都担任了最艰巨的任务，表现了为群众利益不畏艰难的精神。当广东省的惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞等县遭到严重的洪水灾害，群众被洪水包围、断绝了粮食时，空军部队立即派出飞机空投粮食、衣服、药品，进行救济。海军也派出了大批舰艇、橡皮船前往营救，或运送救济物资。洪水侵入惠州后，某部驻军胡继成少将亲自驾驶小舟指挥抢救工作。某部警卫连官兵与洪水搏斗四昼夜，使惠州镇二千多居民脱险。许多部队并且把抢救出的灾民，作了妥善的安置。有的腾出营房宿舍让灾民住；有的节约粮食给灾民吃；有的战士拿出自己的衣服给灾民穿。高射炮某支部战士韦修明，还把爱人寄给他的四双布鞋捐给灾民。江苏省吕泗渔场遭到暴风袭击时，有的渔船被隔在远海，处境十分困难。海军部队闻讯后，立即派出舰艇和水上飞机，携带大批食品和救生工具赶往抢救，使绝大部分渔民很快脱险。某舰队在极端困难条件下，冒着十级大风，救出了七只渔船和四十四个渔民。水兵们还把自己的衣服脱下来，披在渔民身上；把自己的饭菜，送给渔民吃。
    各地部队还积极协助灾区群众恢复生产，重建家园。广东东江地区部队派出干部和医务人员五百多人，组成工作队深入灾区，协助地方干部进行善后工作。他们帮助群众盖房子四百五十多间，免费给二千多灾民治了病。这个部队还派出了七千多官兵，协同民工抢修东江大堤，为争取晚稻特大丰收而奋战。灾区人民感动地说：洪水包围时，解放军来救我们；洪水退了，又来帮助我们，真是我们的子弟兵。他们表示，一定要加紧生产，来报答党、毛主席和解放军的恩情。
    福建、江西、云南、河北等地驻军，也在防汛抢险中，贡献了巨大的力量。云南江城哈尼族自治县水库被洪水冲垮后，驻军官兵冒着倾盆大雨跑步奔向水库，分别上山撬、运石头、编竹笼、疏通河道，奋战九小时，战胜了洪水，保证了这一带哈尼族和彝族人民的生命安全，庄稼也没有受到损失。河北省唐山地区一连下了几天大雨，滦河洪水猛涨，使滦河大坝受到严重威胁。驻军部队官兵在叶淦少校带领下，于7月22日早晨冒雨赶赴滦河大坝，从早晨一直战斗到晚上，保卫了滦河附近人民生命财产的安全。
    解放军英勇抢救灾区人民的行动，给了灾区人民以巨大的鼓舞。每当飞机飞临灾区上空，聚集在山头上的灾民都振臂高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”并且纷纷写信给解放军表示：一定要加紧生产，来报答党、毛主席和解放军同志的关怀和帮助。
