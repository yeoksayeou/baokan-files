According to the Shaanxi Daily, the Zhuangli People's Commune in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, based on the characteristics of cotton field pest activity this year, adopted a "four combinations" method of prevention and control, and successively defeated the three major enemies of cotton - cotton aphids, spider mites, and mirid bugs, determined to increase cotton production even further.

The Zhuangli Commune's more than 28,000 mu of cotton this year have been continuously plagued by cotton aphids, spider mites, and mirid bugs since the seedling stage. According to statistics, more than 60% of the cotton fields were harmed by cotton aphids in the early stages; mirid bugs occurred from early June and spread rapidly in July, with 21% of the cotton plants affected; spider mites were active half a month earlier than in previous years.

In order to effectively eliminate insect pests, the commune has adopted a set of "four combinations" pest control methods: (1) Combining areas with insects and areas without insects. The entire commune is divided into six joint prevention zones according to mountains, rivers, and irrigated and dry lands, and conducts large-scale pest control collaboration based on the principle of equivalent exchange. (2) Combining professional teams with mass movements. Here, 176 pest control professional teams (including more than 2,000 people) were established early on, with responsibilities assigned to households and individuals, implementing inspection and key prevention and control. When insect pests occur universally, a comprehensive mobilization and comprehensive assault is implemented.
(3) Combining key treatment with universal prevention. Universal prevention focuses on spraying mixed agents to prevent various insect pests; key treatment is aimed at an insect pest in a certain period, focusing on the onset points and comprehensively encircling and suppressing insect pests. (4) Combining scientific technology with the experience of old farmers. In addition to training 450 technicians, the commune also absorbed some old farmers to set up a staff headquarters for each pest control team, solving the problem of insufficient technical strength; in terms of prevention and control methods, both indigenous and foreign methods were used, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient pesticides.

The Zhuangli Commune has gone through four battles to eliminate insect pests from the cotton seedling stage to the present, with rapid action and great results. At present, cotton aphids, mirid bugs, and spider mites have been basically controlled or eliminated here. Commune members are continuing to pursue and capture them, protecting the cotton through the budding and boll-forming stage. (Attached picture)

### 铜川庄里人民公社　棉田除虫战术好收效大

　　棉田除虫战术好收效大
    据陕西日报消息　陕西省铜川市庄里人民公社，根据今年棉田虫害活动的特点，采取四大结合的防治办法，连续战胜了棉花的三大劲敌——棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象，决心增产更多棉花。
    庄里公社今年的两万八千多亩棉花，从幼苗期开始，就连续发生棉蚜、红蜘蛛、盲椿象为害。据统计，早期棉蚜为害的棉田达60％以上；盲椿象从6月上旬发生，7月间迅速蔓延，受害棉株达21％；红蜘蛛比往年提早半月活动。
    为了有效地扑灭虫害，公社采取的一套“四结合”防虫办法是：（一）有虫区和无虫区相结合。全社按照山川、水旱，搭配划分了六个联防区，本着等价交换的原则，开展防虫大协作。（二）专业队与群众运动相结合。这里很早就建立一百七十六个（包括两千多人）防虫专业队，责任落实到户到人，实行检查和重点防治。当虫害普遍发生时，就实行全面动员、全面突击。
  （三）重点治疗与普遍预防相结合。普遍预防，着重在喷洒混合药剂，预防各种虫害；重点治疗，是针对一个时期的虫害，集中发病点，全面围剿虫害。（四）科学技术和老农经验相结合。公社除培养了四百五十名技术员外，还吸收了部分老农，给各防虫小组设立参谋部，解决了技术力量不足的问题；在防治方法上，也是土洋兼用，克服了农药不足的困难。
    庄里公社从棉花幼苗期到现在，已经经过了四次灭虫害的战役，行动迅速，收效很大。目前，这里的棉蚜、盲椿象和红蜘蛛，已基本被控制或消灭。社员们正继续深追大捕，保护棉花过好蕾铃关。（附图片）
