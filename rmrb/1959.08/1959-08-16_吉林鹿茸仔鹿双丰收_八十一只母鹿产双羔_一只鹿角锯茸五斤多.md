Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 15th: State-owned and people's commune deer farms in Jilin Province have achieved abundant harvests since they began producing fawns and harvesting antlers in early May. Currently, deer farming throughout the province has increased by 27% compared to the same period last year, and antler production has also increased by about 20% compared to last year. In the recent period, among more than 3,100 pregnant does across the province, 2,884 fawns have been born, with an average survival rate of 88.6%, an increase of about 3% compared to last year. Various places have also seen new records for fawn survival rates, such as the Dongfeng Deer Farm, where the fawn survival rate is as high as 91.5%, and the fawn survival rate of the deer farms in various people's communes in Shuangyang County has also reached 90%. A doe giving birth to twin fawns was often considered a rare event in the past, but in recent years, due to the continuous improvement of feeding and management levels, the number of twin fawns has increased year by year. This year, a total of eighty-one does on deer farms throughout the province gave birth to twin fawns.

Antlers throughout the province are also generally growing thick and strong. The second set of antlers (one antler with two branches) sawn from a sika deer at the Longtanshan Deer Farm in Jilin City weighed 53 taels in water, yielding about 19 taels of finished velvet. Various farms are currently processing the harvested antlers.

Currently, employees at deer farms throughout the province are carefully caring for the fawns and rushing to process the antlers, while also preparing intensely for the new breeding season. They are determined to break last year's doe conception rate of 90.3% and strive for an even greater harvest of fawns next year. (Attached photo)

    吉林鹿茸仔鹿双丰收
    八十一只母鹿产双羔
    一只鹿角锯茸五斤多
    新华社长春15日电　吉林省各国营和人民公社的养鹿场，自5月初开始产羔和收茸以来，都获得了丰盛的收获。目前，全省养鹿比去年同期增加了27％，鹿茸产量也比去年增加了20％左右。最近一个时期，全省三千一百多只怀胎的母鹿中，已产小鹿二千八百八十四只，平均成活率88.6％，比去年提高3％左右。各地还出现了不少小鹿成活率的新纪录，如东丰鹿场小鹿成活率高达91.5％，双阳县各人民公社养鹿场的小鹿成活率也达到90％。一鹿产双羔，在以前往往被认作是奇事，近几年来由于饲养管理水平不断提高，双胞胎小鹿逐年增加。今年全省养鹿场共有八十一只母鹿产了双羔。
    全省鹿茸也普遍生长得粗壮肥大，吉林市龙潭山养鹿场的花鹿二扛（一个角两个杈）锯茸，水重达五十三市两，可出成品茸十九两左右。各场正在将收下来的鹿茸加工制作。
    目前，全省各鹿场职工一面细心养护小鹿，突击鹿茸加工；一面紧张地准备迎接新的配种季节。他们决心打破去年母鹿受胎率90.3％的纪录，争取明年仔鹿更大的丰收。（附图片）
