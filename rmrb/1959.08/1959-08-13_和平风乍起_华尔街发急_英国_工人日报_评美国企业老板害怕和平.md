Xinhua News Agency, London, August 12th: The London "Worker's Daily" today published an editorial entitled "Fear of Peace," saying, "Wall Street is panicking because a peaceful situation may be emerging. Just as millions of people around the world welcome the upcoming Khrushchev-Eisenhower talks, large American corporations are worried that military spending will be reduced and profits will decline as a result." The editorial pointed out that Khrushchev said the Soviet Union is prepared to guarantee not to be the first to resume nuclear testing. The Americans, however, were still talking a day or two ago about their plans to resume nuclear testing in the fall.

The editorial said, "Now Khrushchev's words pose a challenge to the Americans and the British. Will they issue the same statement, or will they refuse and continue testing?"

　　和平风乍起　华尔街发急
　　英国“工人日报”评美国企业老板害怕和平
    据新华社伦敦12日电　伦敦“工人日报”今天以“害怕和平”为题发表社论说，“华尔街正在发慌，因为可能出现和平的局面。正当全世界千百万人欢迎即将举行的赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔会谈的时候，美国的大企业却担心因此军备开支减少，利润降低”。社论指出，赫鲁晓夫说过，苏联准备保证不首先重新开始核试验。而美国人一两天前还一直在谈论他们打算在秋天重新开始核试验。
    社论说，“现在赫鲁晓夫的这番话向美国人和英国人提出一个挑战。他们将发表同样的声明呢，还是将表示拒绝并继续进行试验？”
