Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 20th: People's communes in rural Hebei Province are actively producing saltpeter while developing diversified economies. From January to July, the province produced more than 2.46 million jin of saltpeter. The saltpeter's nitrate content reached over 75%, meeting quality standards.

People's communes in saltpeter-producing areas of Hebei Province have regarded saltpeter production as a major sideline, reasonably allocating labor. This year, Tianjin organized more than 100,000 people to engage in large-scale saltpeter production. During the peak season for saltpeter production, communes also mobilized the masses to sweep saltpeter soil in large quantities, stockpiling raw materials for the off-season. Many saltpeter factories sun-dried the brine and saltpeter soil mixture left over after boiling saltpeter and then boiled it again. Therefore, although there was heavy rain in Hebei Province in July, and a large amount of saltpeter soil on the ground was washed away by rainwater, nearly 100,000 jin of saltpeter were still produced.

This year, commercial departments in Hebei Province supplied a batch of iron pots for boiling saltpeter to support rural saltpeter production and actively carried out purchasing and transportation work. Tianjin alone purchased and transported more than 1.3 million jin of saltpeter from January to July, supporting the chemical industry in the city and other provinces.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 20th: As the peak season for saltpeter production has just passed, relevant departments in Shandong Province have arranged for saltpeter production this winter and next spring, planning to produce 12 million jin of saltpeter in the province.

Relevant departments in Shandong Province require people's communes and saltpeter production units in various regions, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, to adopt methods such as combining professional teams with mass auxiliary production, combining collective production with decentralized production, and combining decentralized sweeping of saltpeter soil with centralized boiling, to vigorously produce saltpeter. During the peak season for sweeping saltpeter soil, it is necessary to organize all forces to sweep saltpeter soil early, concentrate storage, in order to prepare for year-round production. In terms of income distribution, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work to promote the enthusiasm of commune members to produce saltpeter. In order to expand the source of nitrate, relevant departments require all regions to carry out technological innovation to increase output and improve quality, and gradually promote the method of loosening the soil on waste alkali land and fields and gardens, and then sprinkling grass ash and human urine to cultivate saltpeter soil. When boiling saltpeter with boiling water, hot water should be used to mix and stir grass ash and sprinkle it to increase the nitrate yield. Local commercial departments should sign purchase and sales contracts with communes, and arrange saltpeter production and purchasing work according to the contracts.

Saltpeter is a major sideline product in more than 50 counties and cities in Shandong Province. In recent years, thanks to the strengthening of leadership by the Party committee and the active support of the government, local saltpeter production has greatly developed. In 1950, the province produced 2 million jin of saltpeter, which increased to 10 million jin in 1958. Many regions have developed from sporadic production to large-scale production; from decentralized production to a combination of decentralized and collective production; from winter and spring seasonal production to year-round production (accumulating saltpeter soil in winter and spring, and boiling it year-round). Chengguan People's Commune in Guan County, which has made relatively successful progress in developing saltpeter production, had 60 saltpeter production teams and 150 saltpeter leaching pools last year. This year, it has developed to 205 saltpeter factories and 850 saltpeter leaching pools, and fixed 1,670 people to specialize in saltpeter production.

    为化学工业、玻璃工业增产原料
    河北七个月生产火硝二百多万斤
    山东及时安排今冬明春火硝生产
    新华社天津20日电　河北省农村各人民公社在发展多种经济中，积极生产火硝。1月到7月，全省共产火硝二百四十六万多斤。火硝含硝率达到75％以上，合乎质量标准。
    河北省各产硝地区的人民公社，都把火硝生产作为一项主要副业，合理安排了劳力。天津市今年组织了十万多人大搞火硝生产。各地公社在火硝生产旺季，也发动群众大量扫硝土，为淡季生产储备原料。许多火硝厂把熬过硝后剩下的卤水、硝土混合晒干后再熬硝，因此，7月份河北省虽然多雨，地面的硝土被雨水大量冲刷，但仍生产了将近十万斤火硝。
    河北省商业部门今年供应了一批熬硝铁锅，支援农村的火硝生产，并且积极进行收购调运工作，仅天津市1月到7月就收购调运火硝一百三十多万斤，支援了本市和外省的化学工业。
    新华社济南20日电　火硝生产的旺季刚过，山东省有关部门又布置了今冬明春的火硝生产，计划全省在今冬明春生产火硝一千二百万斤。
    山东省有关部门要求各地人民公社和火硝生产单位，在当地党委统一领导下，采取专业队与群众辅助性生产相结合、集体生产与分散生产相结合、分散扫硝土和集中熬制相结合等办法，大力生产火硝。在扫硝土的旺季里，要组织一切力量，早扫硝土，集中储存，以备常年生产。在收益分配上，要坚决贯彻按劳分配、多劳多得的原则，促进社员生产火硝的积极性。为扩大硝源，有关部门要求各地开展技术革新，增加产量，提高质量，并逐步推广在废碱地和场园上松土后撒上草木灰和人尿，培种硝土的办法。在沸水熬硝时，应利用开水掺拌草木灰淋洒，以提高出硝率。各地商业部门应与公社订立购销合同，按合同安排火硝生产和收购工作。
    火硝是山东省五十多个县、市的主要副业产品。近几年来，由于党委加强领导，政府积极扶持，当地的火硝生产有很大发展。1950年，全省产火硝二百万斤，1958年就增加到一千万斤，许多地区已由零星生产发展到大量生产；由分散生产发展到分散与集体相结合的生产；由冬、春季节性生产，发展到常年生产（冬、春积下硝土，常年熬制）。发展火硝生产比较有成绩的冠县城关人民公社，去年有六十个火硝生产组、一百五十个淋硝池，今年发展到二百零五个火硝厂、八百五十个淋硝池，并固定了一千六百七十人专业生产火硝。
