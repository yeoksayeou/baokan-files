    The Party, the Source of Confidence and Strength for Disaster Victims
    --From the Heavily Affected Areas of Dongjiang
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Du Daozheng
    All readers who are concerned about the disaster situation in Dongjiang, Guangdong Province, we guess, must be as eager as we are to know not only its outline but also its details. With the same desire as everyone, we visited Zengcheng County, one of the counties severely affected by the disaster in early July. We talked with the county party committee and visited six severely affected villages.

            There Was Heroic Resistance
    In people's impression, it seems that when the flood peaks of the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers approached, the party organizations led the people to resist and overcome them; while the Dongjiang River, due to the large and fierce floods and the suddenness of the disaster, was caught off guard and was swept away by the floods. Actually, it's not like that.
    The flood in the Dongjiang River was greater than those in the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers. The hydrological records we saw in Xiajie Village illustrate this point. Next to a small hill in Xiajie Village, there is a tall blue brick gatehouse, densely written with the records of flood levels over the past hundred years. The one on June 24th of the 3rd year of Xianfeng (Qing Dynasty) was the highest, almost submerging the main gate of the gatehouse. But this flood was three decimeters higher than that. This flood was able to twist the rails of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, which has a roadbed as high as one or two zhang, into various strange shapes like playing with dough. The flood was extremely crazy. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people still carried out extremely heroic resistance.
    The responsible comrades of the Zengcheng County Party Committee told us that the flood peaks appeared on June 14th and 15th. However, on the 11th, when the rainstorm first arrived, its momentum was very different from usual. The rain columns of the storm were as thick and white as hemp ropes, hanging all over the dark sky. The county party committee felt the situation was dangerous, so it held an emergency meeting. Starting from the worst-case scenario, it decided that all work should be subordinate to flood control, and all materials should be allocated for flood control. Three of the five secretaries of the county party committee led one hundred and thirty cadres to rush to the most dangerous dikes for rescue, while two organized logistics to support the flood fighting.
    On the evening of the 11th and the 12th, all party organizations in the county held emergency meetings in the midst of the wind and rain. Healthy party members, the principal party committee secretaries, all went to the dikes, while the deputy party committee secretaries and party members with weaker health led the masses in the rear to harvest crops and support the struggle to protect the dikes.
    The six medium-sized reservoirs in Zengcheng County that irrigate more than 10,000 mu of farmland were all rescued after heroic protection. For example, the Lian'an and Lianhe reservoirs, which were newly built and not yet completed, showed signs of danger because they could not withstand the excessive pressure of the flood. The flood level of the Lian'an Reservoir rose at a rate of four decimeters per hour, and the 40-meter-high auxiliary dam was only five decimeters away from overflowing and collapsing. At this extremely critical moment, Song Yue, the chief commander of the reservoir protection and the first secretary of the Zhongxin Commune Party Committee, led the workers in intense rescue efforts. For every inch the water rose, the dam was raised by one foot, ensuring that the dam top did not overflow. The flood could not rush out from the dam top and violently impacted the spillway. In a few places within the spillway, the flood scoured to a depth of 3.3 meters; the spillway also endangered the slope angle of the auxiliary dam. At this time, more than 2,000 workers at the construction site were high in spirits, driving piles and piling stones. Many cadres and workers persisted for two days and two nights in the rainstorm and flood rapids. Their hands and feet were bruised all over, but they did not leave the front line, and finally ensured the safety of the reservoir.
    While people were successfully protecting the reservoirs, all the dikes withstood the initial onslaught of the flood. On the evening of the 13th, the flood and rainwater were too great. Although the six large reservoirs remained safe and stored a large amount of floodwater, the floodwater in the rivers outside the dikes and the rainwater accumulation inside the dikes rose sharply, and the floodwater and rainwater attacked the dikes together, causing the dikes to be in critical condition. The Shatang section of the Zengbo Great Embankment, a four-kilometer levee, was completely submerged. More than 1,000 workers on the levee, led by County Party Secretary Zhong Jingyang, Commune Party Secretary Tan Yixin, and others, bravely added to the levee. As the water rose, the levee was raised, increasing the sub-levee by five to seven decimeters, competing with the flood. They persisted from 8:00 in the morning to 1:00 in the afternoon. Later, breaches appeared in the sub-levee, and everyone blocked the breaches, but they were breached again and again. They persisted until 6:00 in the afternoon before withdrawing from the remaining dike.

          Rescuing Lives Above All Else
    On the 14th and 15th, after the flood peaks appeared in Zengcheng County, all large and small dikes were submerged, and the water depth in many places along the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, which has a roadbed as high as one or two zhang, reached the knees. Villages along the river were all flooded, and hundreds and thousands of people were surrounded by the flood. The central and southern areas of Zengcheng County were a vast expanse of water, with only a few small hills, dike tops, railway roadbeds, rooftops, and treetops exposed. Under such a large flood attack, it was impossible to prevent everything. The party organizations and the masses were forced to abandon the dikes and turn to rescuing lives.
    The party organizations encountered the enormous difficulty of a complete breakdown in communications. The telephone lines between the communes and the county party committee, and between the communes and the production teams, were cut off and submerged, and most of the telephones were destroyed by lightning. A branch comrade from a production team said, "There is nothing more painful than not receiving instructions from higher authorities." At this critical moment, the various party organizations that were divided and isolated by the flood carried out very intense work. When they did not receive instructions from the higher party organizations, they made independent decisions; if meetings could not be held in houses, they were held on mountains, in small boats, or in dangerous buildings; if the secretary was trapped by the flood and could not return, other comrades presided over the meetings. All the meetings passed resolutions that rescuing people was above all else, and that party members should withdraw last. In the six villages we visited, party members divided up responsibility by street and area, organizing local boats, or temporarily tying up rafts, or using other methods, to do their best to rescue people's lives and property. Comrades from the county party committee introduced that 99% of the party members in the county, at this critical moment of life and death, did their best to rescue people and withdraw later, demonstrating a high spirit of self-sacrifice.
    The vast majority of the elderly, sick, and children in the county were transferred to safe areas by the commune in a unified manner before the flood overflowed the dikes. Some others were also gradually transferred to safe areas. When the flood entered the villages and sealed the doorways, most of the people trapped in the village in dangerous buildings, rooftops, treetops, small hills, and dike tops were those who relied on their experience and familiarity with the water, and refused to transfer even after several mobilizations. The others were the flood-fighting teams that withdrew from the dikes. Quite a few people were trapped. In Xiajie Village, 1,000 people out of 1,600 were trapped. At this time, the wind and rain were mixed in the sky, and the flood below was rising rapidly at a rate of two to four decimeters per hour. Houses were collapsing one after another, and cries for help were heard everywhere. At this time, it was still the party members who, leading the cadres and swimming villagers, worked tirelessly, regardless of their own lives and families, and stepped forward to rescue people everywhere. Many disaster victims in Zengcheng County were rescued from windows, rooftops, trees, and deep water. Some disaster victims in Xiajie Village hid in the attics of high houses, and the doorways were sealed by the flood. There were no windows upstairs, so party members Li Huanxin and Li Yaochu dug holes in the walls and pulled people out one by one from the holes. A family of seven farmers (including five children) from Honghuadi Village was washed away more than one kilometer by the flood and rescued by the troops. Similar things happened in almost every village.
    A party member cadre from the Shitan Commune described the scene of rescuing people at that time: From Zengjiang to Dongjiang, for dozens of miles, in the vast expanse of water, there were rescue boats sent by the party everywhere. There were small boats, large boats carrying 200 people, and naval vessels. The materials of the Shitan Commune Party Committee stated that at that time, there were 78 boats from the county, neighboring counties, and Guangzhou to rescue people in the Shitan Commune, and 450 boats from within the commune to rescue people. The 50,271 people in the Shitan Commune, none of them drowned. This was the result of the party organization's large-scale and heroic rescue.
    The hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Zengcheng County who were surrounded by the flood were all rescued to safe areas by the 17th and 18th, with only sixteen people sacrificed. After rescuing people to safe areas, the male party members led the able-bodied villagers to continue rowing boats to rescue cattle and property, while the female party members stayed in safe places to boil water, cook food, and take care of the old and young. The organs and farmers who originally lived near the safe areas vacated their houses and took out clothes, food, and firewood to take care of the disaster victims. The county party committee and the commune promptly brought rice to the disaster victims, and the air force taking off from Guangzhou dropped biscuits and cooked food every day. After the disaster victims of the Zengjiang Commune were transferred to Phoenix Mountain and other highlands, in addition to only eating half a jin of rice on the first day, they were able to eat one jin of rice every day thereafter. The day-care organization was also restored on the mountain. More than 100 children in the Xiajie Kindergarten could still eat biscuits and candies that the "uncles" had obtained from other places every other day under such difficult conditions.

        You Can't See the Mood of Disaster Here
      From June 20th, the flood gradually receded, and the disaster victims returned home one after another. It would have been better if the disaster victims in the heavily affected areas had not returned home. As soon as they returned home, some elderly women couldn't help but cry bitterly. The flood not only turned the rice they had worked hard to cultivate and were about to eat into a muddy mess, but even more tragically destroyed everyone's homes. In the six villages with more than 100 households we visited, the houses in three villages could be said to have completely collapsed.
    In the heavily affected villages, except for the complete preservation of people—the most valuable asset—and the preservation of 99% of the cattle, other things such as crops, livestock, household items, and water conservancy projects were damaged by 70% to 80% or 80% to 90%. Among the sixteen communes in Zengcheng County, four communes were heavily affected, nine were generally affected, and three were lightly affected. Half of the county's rice was destroyed, one-third of the cash crops were destroyed, and more than 31,000 houses collapsed. The loss of water conservancy projects was even greater. The earthwork of the water conservancy projects washed away in Shitan Commune alone was more than 1.3 million cubic meters.
    In the face of this unprecedented disaster, many masses and a few party members in Zengcheng County had pessimistic and negative emotions for a short period. But under the leadership of the party committee and the majority of party members, they quickly cheered up. The Party and the masses rescued all the people and almost all the cattle, which was to prepare for a comeback in the future. While the flood was still wreaking havoc, the Shitan Commune Party Committee in the heavily affected area used boats to bring cadres to the high mountains to hold a three-level cadre meeting of 600 people, to arrange for the restoration of production and to call for "reaping one year's grain in one season." After the meeting, many production teams sent people back to the village to dive into the water to salvage rice seeds. The Shitan Commune salvaged 2,550 dan of rice seeds. The party members of the Yuanzhou Production Brigade decided to plant late rice as soon as the flood receded, so they had to sow and cultivate seedlings before the flood receded. But all the fields of their entire production brigade were immersed in the flood, and there was not an inch of land that could be sown. They found a seedling field on the high mountains of the commune's forestry brigade and sowed the seeds there.
    The party organizations in the heavily affected villages in Zengcheng County are reclaiming and managing as the flood recedes, arranging for life and restoring production at the same time. The flood in most parts of Zengcheng County receded by the end of June, but by June 30, 80,100 mu of late rice had been sown, completing 97% of the late rice sowing task. 76,000 mu of land was plowed, 57,000 mu of land was harrowed, 90,000 mu of early rice was harvested, and more than 8,000 mu of early-maturing crops were planted. Out of the 210,000 laborers in the county, 200,120 laborers were mobilized on June 30 alone.
    The work of blocking breaches, restoring dikes, and repairing water conservancy projects, which played a decisive role in the late-season production in the disaster area, was carried out even more enthusiastically on July 1st to 5th when we visited. For example, the dike restoration project in the Shakou section of the Zengbo Great Embankment mobilized 4,000 people every day. On June 27, an average laborer did 0.74 cubic meters of earthwork, and then gradually increased. On July 1, encouraged by party members, the workers proposed to present a gift to the Party's birthday, and the amount of earthwork completed by each person on that day increased to 1.78 cubic meters. There was a Niutang commando team of fifty people who created a record of 6.8 cubic meters per person that day. The Niutang team automatically rushed to the construction site before dawn every day to start work. There is a reason why this team is so active. Yao Zhouying, a poor peasant member of the Niutang team, said: When the flood overflowed the dike, the production team leader mobilized us to go to a safe place. Some people also said: It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter! The team leader was anxious and dragged these people out of the house. We were not far from the village, and the flood entered the village, and houses collapsed one after another. The team leader led us to escape to a place, and the flood surrounded us again. I thought, we can't escape this time! Suddenly, comrades drove electric boats (referring to motor boats) to us and rescued us to the mountain. Later, planes dropped biscuits from the sky, saving our lives. The kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is truly endless. If it were the Kuomintang, encountering such a big flood, nine out of ten people would die, and who would care about us! Now, the Party is leading us to repair the dikes, all for our own good, why shouldn't we do it?
    In the six villages we visited, the disaster victims' rations have been arranged until the end of August. The main laborers can eat one jin of rice a day, ordinary people can eat about half a jin, and they can also eat some fish and vegetable melon. Public canteens have been restored. Nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools have also mostly been restored. The biggest difficulty is that the houses have all collapsed, but the phenomenon of sleeping in the open has now been eliminated. Some people live in public buildings, some live in temporary sheds or thatched sheds, and some families are squeezed into the houses that have not collapsed. However, materials for building houses are being actively prepared. Zengcheng County has prepared more than 100,000 pieces of wood and hundreds of thousands of dan of lime, and is preparing to burn bricks and tiles on a large scale. After the busy summer harvest and summer planting are over, large-scale construction will begin to build new houses.
    People who visited the disaster area in Zengcheng all said, "You can't see the mood of disaster here." We believe this sentence, and we also believe that the heavily affected area of Zengcheng County will be able to create a miracle of "seeing new villages without seeing traces of disaster" by the end of the year.

    党，灾民信心和力量的泉源  
    ——从东江重灾区来
    新华社记者　杜导正
    所有关心广东省东江灾情的读者，我们猜，一定和我们一样，不满足于知道它的轮廓，还迫切地希望知道它的细节。抱着和大家同样的愿望，我们在7月初访问了东江重灾县份之一的增城县，和县委谈过，又访问了六个重灾村庄。
            有过英勇的抵抗
    在人们的印象中，好像西江、北江的洪峰压境时，党组织率领人民进行了抵抗，并且战胜了它；而东江由于洪水大洪水猛，猝不及防，因此没有抵抗，便被洪水卷走了“一切”。其实，不是这样。
    东江洪水比西江、北江的大。在夏街村我们看到的水文记载就说明了这一点。夏街村小山坡旁有一座高大的青砖门楼，上边密密麻麻地写满了一百年来各次洪水水位的纪录。清咸丰3年6月24日那次是最高的，快淹到门楼的正门顶了。但是这次洪水还比它高三分米。此次洪水能把路基高达一两丈的广（广州）深（深圳）铁路的铁轨，像玩面筋一样扭成各种奇形怪状。洪水疯狂到极点了。但是人民在党的领导下，照样进行了极其英勇的抵抗。
    中共增城县委的负责同志对我们说，洪峰出现于6月14日、15日。但是，11日，暴风雨初到，来势便和平常大不相同。暴雨的雨柱，有麻绳一般粗一般白，一条条挂满黑暗的天空。县委感到形势凶险，便召开紧急会议，从最坏的情况估计出发，决定一切工作服从防洪，一切物资听候防洪调拨。县委五个书记，三个带领一百三十个干部立刻分头到最危险的堤上抢险，两个组织后勤，支援抢洪。
    11日晚间和12日，在狂风暴雨中，全县所有党组织都举行过紧急会议。身体健康的党员，正职党委书记，全部上堤，副职党委书记，身体弱的党员率领群众在后方抢收，支援堤围上的抢险斗争。
    增城县六个灌溉万亩以上农田的中型水库，就是经过英勇的保护、全部抢救出来的。如今年新建未竣工的联安、联和水库，因承受不了洪水过大的压力，出现险象。联安水库洪水水位以时速四分米的速度上涨，四十米高的副堤只差五分米就要漫顶崩裂了。在这万分紧急的时候，水库护库总指挥、中新公社党委第一书记宋岳，率领民工紧张抢救，水高一寸，坝高一尺，保证了坝顶没有发生漫溢。洪水从坝顶冲不出去，猛力冲击溢洪道，溢洪道内少数地方被洪水冲深达三点三米；溢洪道又危及副坝坡角，这时，工地上两千多民工斗志昂扬，打桩堆石，有不少干部、民工在暴风雨和洪水急流中坚持两天两夜，手脚砸得到处是伤痕，不下火线，终于保证了水库的安全。
    当人们胜利地护卫水库的同时，所有堤围都抵住了洪水的初次侵袭。13日晚，洪水、雨水太大，六个大型水库虽然仍保持安全，蓄满了大量洪水，但是堤围外的江河洪水和堤围内的暴雨渍水一块暴涨，洪水雨水夹攻堤围，使堤围告急。增博大围沙塘段四公里大堤全部漫顶。堤上民工一千多人，在县委书记钟景阳、公社党委书记谭宜信等率领下，奋勇加堤，水涨堤高，加高子堤五到七分米，与洪水争高，从早晨八点坚持到下午一点。以后子堤出现破口，大家又堵口，堵而复缺，缺而复堵，一直坚持到下午六时，才撤离残堤。
          抢救人命高于一切
    14日、15日，增城县出现洪峰后，所有大小堤围全部漫顶，路基高达一两丈的广深铁路许多地方水深及膝，沿江村庄全被洪水侵入，成百成千的人民群众被洪水包围，增城县中部和南部地区一片汪洋，露出水面的只有少数小山头、堤顶、铁路路基、房顶、树梢。在这样大的洪水袭击下，防不胜防，党组织和群众被迫弃守堤围，转入抢救人命的工作。
    党组织碰到了通讯联络全部中断的巨大困难。公社与县委，公社与生产队的电话线路被冲断淹没，电话机大都被雷电击毁。一个生产队的支部同志说，“再没有比接不到上级指示更痛苦的了”，在这危急的时刻，被洪水分割、孤立的各个党组织，进行了非常紧张的工作。接不到上级党的指示，自己独立的决定；房里开不成会，在山上开，在小艇上开，在危楼上开；书记被洪水困住回不来，别的同志主持开会。所有的会，都通过了救人高于一切，党员最后撤走的决议。我们访问过的六个村庄，都是党员分街分片包干，组织本地的小艇，或临时绑扎木筏，或用其它方法，用全力抢救人民生命和财产的。县委同志介绍说，全县99％的党员，在这生死关头，作到了拼命救人，撤走在后，表现了很高的自我牺牲精神。
    全县绝大部分老人、病人、小孩，早在洪水漫溢堤围以前，便由公社统一组织转移到安全地区。其他的人，也有一些陆续迁移到安全地区。洪水侵入村庄。将门口封了的时候，围困在村里危楼、房顶、树顶、小山、堤顶的人，大多数是那些自恃有经验，熟水性，动员几次不肯转移的人。另外是从堤围上撤下来的抗洪队伍。被围困的人相当多，夏街村一千六百人，被围的一千人。此时天上风雨交加，地下洪水一小时以两分米到四分米的速度暴涨，房屋一片一片地倒塌，到处传来求救的声音。这时候，还是那些党员同志，带领干部和会游泳的社员，废寝忘食，不顾自己的生命和家庭，挺身而出，到处救人。增城县的许多灾民是从窗口、房顶、树上、深水中救出来的。夏街村有些灾民躲在高房内的阁楼上，门口被洪水封住，楼上没有窗口，党员黎焕新、黎耀初从墙上挖开洞口，从洞中将人一个个掏出来。红花地村一户农民全家七口（其中五个小孩）被洪水冲去一公里多，被部队救起。类似的事情，差不多每个村庄都有。
    石滩公社的一位党员干部叙述当时救人的情景时说：从增江到东江几十里，在白茫茫的一片汪洋里，尽是党派来的救生船。有小艇，有载二百人的大船，有海军的舰艇。石滩公社党委会的材料说，那时候，从县里、邻县、广州开到石滩公社救人的船只就有七十八只，公社内部出动救人的船四百五十只。石滩公社五万零二百七十一人，没有淹死一个人，就是党的组织这种大规模地英勇地抢救的结果。
    增城县被洪水围困的十几万灾民，到17日18日就先后全部抢救到安全地区，牺牲的仅仅十六人。把人抢救到安全地区后，男党员率领精壮社员，继续划艇抢救耕牛财物，女党员留在安全地点烧水煮饭，照顾老幼。原来住在安全地区附近的机关、农民，腾出房子，拿出衣服、粮食、木柴照顾灾民，县委和公社及时给灾民调来大米，广州起飞的空军天天投下饼干、熟食。增江公社的灾民转移到凤凰山等高地后，除第一天只吃到半斤大米以外，以后每天都能吃到一斤大米，在山上还恢复了
  日托幼儿组织，夏街幼儿院一百多幼儿，在那种困苦的条件下，还能隔日吃到“叔叔”们从别处弄来的饼干和糖果。
        这里看不到受灾的情绪
      6月20日起，洪水渐渐退去，灾民陆续回家。重灾区灾民不回家还好，一回家，一些老年妇女便忍不住地痛哭。洪水不仅把辛勤经营、吃到嘴边的稻子，漫成一片烂泥巴，更惨的是将每个人的家毁了。我们访问的六个百户以上的村庄，有三个村的房子可说全部倒塌了。
    重灾的村庄，除完整地保存了人——这一项最宝贵的财产，保存了99％的耕牛以外，其它如农作物、家畜、家私、水利工程都坏了七八成或八九成。增城县十六个公社有四个公社属于重灾公社，九个属于一般受灾公社，三个属于轻灾公社。全县水稻毁一半，经济作物毁三分之一，塌房三万一千多间。水利工程损失更大，只石滩公社冲掉的水利工程土方就在一百三十万立方米以上。
    在这种史无前例的灾害面前，增城县不少群众和少数党员曾经在短暂时间里有过悲观与消极情绪。但在党委和大多数党员的带动下，很快地振作起来了。党和群众救出了全部的人，几乎全部的耕牛，就是准备日后翻身的。当洪水还在大肆作孽的时候，重灾区的石滩公社党委就用船只将一个个干部接到高山上来开了六百人的三级干部大会，布置恢复生产，号召“一造要收一年粮”。会后，许多生产队派人回村潜入水底捞谷种。石滩公社抢救出的谷种有二千五百五十担。元洲生产大队的党员决定洪水一退就要插晚稻，因此要在洪水退出以前播种育秧。但是他们全生产大队的田地统通浸在洪水中，没有一寸土地可以播种。他们便从公社林业大队的高山上找到一块秧田，将种子播下去。
    增城县各重灾村庄的党组织，都是洪水退一块，经营一块，边安排生活，边恢复生产的。增城县绝大部分地方的洪水在6月底退清，但到6月30日，晚稻已播种八万零一百亩，完成晚稻播种任务的97％。犁田七万六千亩，耙田五万七千亩，抢收早稻九万亩，种早熟作物八千多亩。全县二十一万劳动力，6月30日一天出动的劳动力有二十万零一千一百二十人。
    对灾区晚造生产具有决定作用的是堵口复堤和修复水利的工作，到我们访问的7月1日到5日，更进行得热火朝天。如增博大围沙口段复堤工程，每日出动四千人，6月27日一个劳力平均做土方工程零点七四立方米，以后逐渐上升，7月1日民工在党员鼓动下提出向党的生日献礼，当日每人完成土方工程上升到一点七八立方米。有个牛塘突击队，五十个人，这天每人更创造了六点八立方米的纪录。牛塘队每日拂晓前便自动赶到工地开工。这个队干得这么积极是有原因的，牛塘队贫农出身的社员姚周应说：洪水漫堤时，生产队长动员我们到安全的地方去。有的人还说：不要紧！不要紧！队长急了，将这些人从房里拖了出来。我们离村不远，洪水进村了，房屋一间接着一间倒塌。队长领着我们刚逃到一个地方，洪水又将我们包围了。我想，这下可跑不了啦！突然，同志们驾着电船（指机动船）到了跟前，把我们救到山上。以后，天上一架又一架飞机，放饼干下来，救了我们的命。共产党，毛主席的恩情真是说不完。如果是国民党，碰上这么大水，十条命九条死，谁睬我们啊！现在，党又领导我们抢修堤围，都是为了我们好，我们为什么不干呢？
    我们访问的六个村庄，灾民的口粮已经安排到8月底，主要劳动力一天能吃到一斤大米，普通人吃到半斤左右，还能吃到一点鱼一点菜瓜。公共食堂都恢复了。托儿所、幼儿院、小学校也大部分恢复了，困难最大的是房子都已倒塌，但是现在也已经消灭了露宿现象，有的住在公共建筑里，有的住在临时搭盖的工棚或草棚里，有的几家挤在未倒塌的房屋里。不过建筑房屋的材料已在积极筹备，增城县已经准备好了十万多根木材，几十万担石灰，准备大烧砖瓦，等到夏收夏种大忙过去，就将大兴土木新建房屋。
    到增城灾区访问的人都说“这里看不到受灾的情绪”，我们相信这句话，也相信增城县重灾区在年底前能出现“不见灾痕见新村”的奇迹。
