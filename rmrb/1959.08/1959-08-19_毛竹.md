Moso Bamboo

China produces over 170 kinds of bamboo. Among them, Moso bamboo is the most widely distributed, has the highest yield, the most uses, and is most closely related to people's lives. Moso bamboo is also called Maozhu; in Hunan and Sichuan, it is called Nan bamboo. It is mainly produced in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou provinces and regions; followed by Sichuan, Yunnan, Anhui, and Hubei; Henan and Shaanxi also have small amounts of production. According to statistics, the national Moso bamboo forest area is about 19 million mu, with reserves of more than 3 billion. The output of Moso bamboo in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces accounts for more than 70% of the total national output.

Moso bamboo has no waste; from bamboo shoots to mature bamboo, from bamboo culms to bamboo branches, all are useful. Bamboo shoots and dried bamboo shoots can be eaten as vegetables. Young bamboo within two years of growth is an excellent raw material for papermaking and can be used to make high-quality typing paper. Large Moso bamboo has the widest range of uses. Since ancient times, it has been used as masts for sailboats, bamboo poles for punting boats, and roof frames for building houses. In recent years, it has been widely used in construction, water conservancy, mining, etc. For example, it replaces some steel bars in reinforced concrete buildings, replaces steel pipes as water pipes or siphons, replaces wood in the manufacture of automobile trailers, and serves as scaffolding for construction. Moso bamboo can be split into bamboo strips to make bamboo beds, bamboo cabinets, chairs, bookshelves, mats, baskets, sieves, baskets, shoulder poles, chopsticks, and other furniture and daily necessities. Handicraftspeople also use Moso bamboo roots to carve various exquisite handicrafts. Bamboo shoots and bamboo branches can also be used to make brooms.

Moso bamboo grows very fast. A Moso bamboo can be harvested and utilized after growing for more than three years. Moso bamboo growth does not take up arable land, it is easy to transplant, management does not require too much labor, and large-scale planting can also accelerate greening and is conducive to soil and water conservation. Since last year, Huaibei area and Zhangbei and Shangyi areas of Hebei have successfully trial-planted, providing experience for future large-scale transplanting of Moso bamboo in Huaibei and outside the Great Wall.

　　毛竹
    我国出产的竹子有一百七十多种。其中分布最广，产量最多，用途最大，同人民生活关系最密切的要数毛竹。毛竹也叫茅竹，湖南和四川叫作楠竹，主要产于浙江、福建、江西、湖南、广东、广西、贵州等省、区；其次是四川、云南、安徽、湖北；河南、陕西也有少量出产。据统计，全国毛竹林面积约一千九百万亩，蕴藏量在三十亿根以上。浙江、福建、江西、湖南四省的毛竹产量占全国总产量70％以上。
    毛竹全身无废品，从竹笋到成竹、从竹干到竹枝，都是有用之物。竹笋和笋干可以做菜吃。生长在两年以内的嫩竹，是造纸的优良原料，可以造出高级打字纸。大毛竹的用途最为广泛，自古以来就用作帆船的桅杆、撑船用的竹篙、砌屋用的屋架；近年来又广泛应用在建筑、水利、采矿等方面。如在钢骨水泥建筑物上代替部分钢筋，代替钢管作输水管或虹吸管，代替木材制造汽车的拖车，作建筑施工用的脚手架等等。将毛竹劈成竹片，可以制造竹床、竹橱、椅子、书架、席子、箩筐、筛子、篮子、扁担、筷子等等家具和日常用品。手工艺人们还利用毛竹根雕制成各种精致的手工艺品。竹梢和竹枝还可编扫帚。
    毛竹长得很快，一根毛竹生长三年以上就可以采伐利用。毛竹生长不占耕地面积，移植方便，管理不需花费过多的劳动力，大量种植还可以加速绿化，有利于水土保持。去年以来，淮北地区和河北的张北、尚义地区都已经试植成功，为今后在淮北和塞外大量移植毛竹，提供了经验。
