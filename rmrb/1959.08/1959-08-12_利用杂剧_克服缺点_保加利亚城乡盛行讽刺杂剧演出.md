Satirical Variety Shows Used to Overcome Shortcomings
Satirical Variety Shows are Popular in Both Urban and Rural Areas of Bulgaria

　　In Bulgaria's towns and villages, people can often hear satirical radio programs and see "humorous and satirical columns" in the small newspapers. Bulgarians usually like to tell jokes and clever remarks when praising and criticizing, so that satire achieves its effect. In the people's clubs everywhere, there are almost always "satirical variety show troupes," and their performances are particularly popular with the masses.

　　For example, the "satirical variety show troupe" in Lazar Stanevo village, Lovech Province, which has been established for four years, the amateur artists participating in this troupe rehearse their programs very carefully. Criticism is carried out very cautiously, and it is often very specific. The materials have always been carefully verified to prevent negligence and errors. The criticism usually also puts forward ways to correct the shortcomings. The variety show usually begins with a short song with popular tunes:
　　“Our voice
　　Spreads across the fields, livestock farms, and threshing grounds
　　Farmers, hello,
　　Let's start telling jokes……”

　　Take their short play "Magic Mirror" as an example! The main content is the performance of a group of livestock complaining. The big gray ox hangs a leather bag on its horns and goes to Sofia. Someone asks the big gray ox what it is doing in the capital. The big gray ox replies: "I am going to study veterinary medicine to treat my brother, because the veterinarian in charge of our area is as proud as an American diplomat and does not want to talk to us 'low-level' people."

　　The lamb screams desperately because there is no breeder. The chicks are very grateful to the Marka Breznitsa village machine tractor station because the combine harvesters there have left many grains in the agricultural cooperative's fields.

　　This short play was extremely successful. The cooperative members who watched the play all knew that these were real "problems". The big gray ox's complaint and the lamb's screams were all things they were familiar with and pained by.

　　After the short play was performed, changes took place in the agricultural cooperative. Veterinarian Bonkov became busy, treating the calves for parasites and improving the care of public livestock. The agricultural cooperative's irrigation system was formulated, and the bathhouses were also renovated.

　　This "performance troupe" in Lazar Stanevo village has helped the village overcome shortcomings on the road to progress through its performance activities. Its reputation is growing, and it recently performed in Sofia.

　　Bulgaria is now carrying out large-scale work to strive to realize the Party's slogan of "completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule." In order to complete this glorious task, it is necessary to eliminate many old ideological remnants that still exist in the minds of some people. In this regard, satirical variety show troupes will shoulder a glorious and lofty task, and they will use humor and satire to help people clear the way for the entire people to move towards communism.

### 利用杂剧　克服缺点　保加利亚城乡盛行讽刺杂剧演出

　　利用杂剧　克服缺点
　　保加利亚城乡盛行讽刺杂剧演出
    在保加利亚的城镇或农村里，人们经常都能够听到讽刺广播节目，看到小报上的“幽默讽刺栏”。保加利亚人平常在表扬和批评时，总爱说点笑话，说点聪明话，使讽刺收到效果。在各地的人民俱乐部里，差不多都设有“讽刺杂剧演出队”，他们的演出特别受到广大群众欢迎。
    例如，成立已达四年的洛维契州拉札尔斯塔?沃村的“讽刺杂剧演出队，参加这个队的业余文艺工作者，节目排练得很用心。批评进行得很谨慎，批评常常很具体。素材一向经过很好的核对，严防发生疏忽和错误。批评意见中一般还提出了改正缺点的办法。杂剧演出一般以流行曲调的短歌开始：
      “我们的声音
    传遍了田野、畜场和场院
    农民们，你们好，
    让我们开始说笑话……”
    以他们演出的短剧“魔镜”为例吧！主要内容是表演一群牲口在诉苦。大灰牛把皮包挂在犄角上，到索非亚去。有人问大灰牛到首都去干什么，大灰牛回答说：“我去学兽医，来医我的哥哥，因为负责我们地段的兽医骄傲得像美国外交官，不愿同我们‘低级’人说话。”
    小羊拼命惨叫，因为没有饲养员。小鸡很感谢马尔卡勃列斯尼查村机器拖拉机站，因为那里的联合收割机在农业社的田里漏下了许多谷粒。
    这个短剧成功极了。观剧的合作社社员都知道这些是真实的“毛病”，大灰牛的诉苦和小羊的惨叫都是他们熟悉的心痛的事物。
    这个短剧演出后，农业社里起了变化了。兽医邦科夫忙碌起来了，替小牛治螩虫，改进对公家牲口的照料。农业社的灌溉制度制定了，浴室也整顿了。
    拉札尔斯塔?沃村的这个“演出队”经过自己的演出活动，帮助本村克服了前进道路上的缺点。它的名望越来越大，不久前还曾到索非亚演出过。
    现在保加利亚正在进行大规模的工作，争取实现党提出来的“提前完成五年计划”的口号。为了完成这一光荣的任务，必须消除某些人意识中还存在的许多旧思想残余。在这方面，讽刺杂剧演出队将担负起光荣和崇高的任务，它们将用幽默和讽刺帮助人们扫清全民走向共产主义的道路。
