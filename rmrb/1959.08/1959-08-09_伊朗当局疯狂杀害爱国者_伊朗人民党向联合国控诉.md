Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 7th—The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran, Radmanesh, recently wrote to the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, strongly protesting the Iranian authorities' murder of Ali Olovi, a member of the Executive Committee of the People's Party of Iran, and the bloody suppression of Iranian workers' strikes.

In the letter, sent on June 22nd, Radmanesh said, "The blood of Iranian patriots, the blood of working-class fighters and ordinary laborers, is flowing into rivers under the bayonets of the police, gendarmes, and the bullets of murderous butchers."

The letter stated that on June 16th of this year, Ali Olovi, a member of the Executive Committee of the People's Party of Iran and an engineer, was executed after being imprisoned for three years, without the usual formal military prosecution, and even before the death sentence was announced to him.

Two days later, on June 18th, on the orders of the King of Iran, the Iranian Gendarmerie opened fire on brick workers in Tehran who had been on strike for three days demanding higher wages, resulting in fifty deaths and many injuries.

On the same day, the army and police forces opened fire on striking workers at the Vatan factory in Isfahan, killing twelve. In addition, countless strikers were arrested in Tehran and Isfahan.

After listing the above facts, the letter said, "In the name of the Iranian workers and the Iranian people, we strongly protest these acts of trampling on the most basic human rights. These rights are not only recognized by the Iranian Constitution but also by the 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights' signed by the Iranian government."

In the letter, Radmanesh requested Hammarskjöld to "take all necessary measures to enable the UN Economic and Social Council to conduct a public investigation into the Iranian government's atrocities against the rights of working people, in accordance with its authority."

The letter also expressed the hope that Hammarskjöld would intervene with the Iranian government, demanding that the Iranian government effectively fulfill its legal and moral responsibilities as a member of the United Nations. The UN Charter stipulates that respect for human rights and freedoms is one of its purposes.

    伊朗当局疯狂杀害爱国者
    伊朗人民党向联合国控诉
    据新华社7日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗人民党中央委员会第一书记拉德马内什最近写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，强烈抗议伊朗当局杀害伊朗人民党执行委员会委员阿里·奥洛维和血腥镇压伊朗工人的罢工。
    拉德马内什在这封6月22日发出的信中说，“伊朗爱国者的鲜血，工人阶级战士和普通劳动者的鲜血，在警察、宪兵的刺刀和杀人屠夫的子弹下，正在汇流成河”。
    信中说，今年6月16日，伊朗人民党执行委员会委员、工程师阿里·奥洛维在被囚禁三年之后，没有经过通常形式上的军事起诉，甚至在死罪判决书都没有向他宣布之前，便被处以枪决了。
    两天之后，6月18日，在伊朗国王的命令下，伊朗宪兵向要求增加工资而罢工了三天的德黑兰砖瓦工人开枪，造成五十人死亡和许多人受伤。
    同一天，军队和警察部队又向伊斯法罕的瓦当工厂的罢工工人开枪，十二人为此牺牲。此外，无数罢工者在德黑兰和伊斯法罕被逮捕。
    这封信在列举了上述事实以后说，“我们以伊朗工人和伊朗人民的名义，强烈抗议这些对于最起码的人权的蹂躏罪行。这些权利不仅得到伊朗宪法的承认，而且也得到为伊朗政府所签署了的‘世界人权宣言’所承认”。
    拉德马内什在信里要求哈马舍尔德“采取一切必要的措施以使联合国经社理事会按照它的职权对伊朗政府损害劳动人民权利的暴行进行公开调查”。
    信中并且表示希望哈马舍尔德对伊朗政府加以干涉，要求伊朗政府切实履行它作为联合国成员所应承担的法律上和道义上的责任。联合国宪章规定尊重人权和人的自由为其宗旨之一。
