Greeting the 10th Anniversary of the National Day with Cleanliness
Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Nanjing Launch Sanitary Assaults

　　This newspaper reports that the third campaign of the Patriotic Health Movement in Shanghai has been launched throughout the city. This campaign adopts the method of concentrated encirclement and annihilation in specific areas and decentralized pursuit, proceeding with key points and steps. Recently, the city, districts, and counties have successively convened meetings of health activists and mobilization meetings in various forms. Districts, streets, factories, industries, and units have signed competition and evaluation agreements, rapidly setting off a wave of health competition. In recent days, from morning to night, people can be seen everywhere catching mosquitoes and flies, sweeping garbage, filling depressions, digging drainage ditches, and spraying insecticide and disinfectant. District Party secretaries, district heads, people's representatives, and members of the CPPCC have all gone to the grassroots units and neighborhoods to participate in cleaning and mosquito and fly catching, while conducting inspections and propaganda mobilization.

　　In this campaign, various districts and units have paid special attention to adopting effective methods to eliminate mosquitoes and flies and control mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Recently, the Huangpu District mobilized more than one hundred cadres and residents to form a shock team, combining the elimination of tree pests and digging out pupae in Huangpu Park, Children's Park, and the Bund green belt, working in shifts day and night. The Jiangnan Shipyard, which launched a health friendship competition with the Qiu Xin, Xin Jian, and Zhonghua shipyards, under the personal leadership of the Party Secretary and Factory Director, organized shock teams in each workshop, taking turns to catch mosquitoes and flies and clear weeds from the riverside and roadsides during lunch breaks and after work, and combining this with the cleanup of old machine parts. More than two hundred unused sheds, wooden houses, and iron sheet houses that are prone to harboring mosquitoes and flies within the factory are being demolished. The Xincai and Bean Sprout Production and Sales First Team in the Tilanqiao District, where mosquitoes and flies were previously numerous, in order to eliminate mosquitoes, flies, and maggots, boiled and disinfected the purchased soy sauce before putting it into the vats, and covered each soy sauce vat with gauze. The team also has a unique method for sealing the salted vegetables: first, a layer of straw is placed on the vegetables, then a layer of oil paper, then another layer of straw, and finally a layer of fresh yellow mud, with lime sprinkled on the yellow mud, and the edges of the vat are washed with salt water. This sealing method not only prevents mosquitoes and flies from entering but also ensures the quality of the vegetables.

　　Various districts, units, and neighborhoods have also revised and improved the sanitation system through competition, evaluation, and inspection, further regularizing the mass patriotic health work.

　　After several days of raids and comprehensive inspections, the sanitary conditions in the city have further improved. Many streets and neighborhoods have basically met the city's sanitary evaluation standards.

　　This newspaper reports that the people of Wuhan are exerting great efforts to actively prepare for launching the autumn sanitation campaign in order to greet the National Day cleanly.

　　This summer, Wuhan has conducted two sanitation campaigns successively and achieved remarkable results. The adoption of the method of assigning areas to different units for responsibility has eliminated a number of stinking lakes, ponds, and ditches, and has reduced the breeding of mosquitoes and flies to some extent. For example, in the past, Labor Street and Fruit Lake Street were places where mosquitoes were abundant, but this summer it is no longer necessary to hang mosquito nets. The sanitation work of the food and beverage industry and non-staple foods has also been strengthened, and many sauce gardens and vegetable markets are free of flies and maggots. The environmental sanitation of the streets has also been greatly improved. However, because the cadres of some units do not pay enough attention to this work and are not enthusiastic enough, in order to further improve environmental sanitation and prevent autumn diseases, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee decided to launch the city's first autumn sanitation assault from August 20 to 25.

　　Now, all districts and systems have taken action, sending special personnel to investigate mosquito and fly breeding grounds and study specific measures to eliminate or control them. A large number of drugs such as "666" smoke fumigant needed for mosquito and fly eradication have been prepared and are being distributed and supplied to residents. Various districts and streets have successively established shock headquarters to study measures for sanitation work. Wuchang and Hanyang districts have also formulated a sanitation work plan combining shock and regular work. (Sun Yuchang)

　　This newspaper reports from Shenyang on August 19th that millions of people in Shenyang are gathering to eliminate flies, mosquitoes, and other pests to greet the National Day. This is the first of three mass sanitation assaults organized by Shenyang before the National Day to eliminate pests and diseases, oppose right-leaning slackness, exert great efforts, and strengthen confidence.

　　On August 15th, Shenyang held a radio conference on the mass extermination of flies, mosquitoes, and pests, which was organized for more than one million people in the city to listen to. Song Guang, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang, read out the decision of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee on carrying out the pest and disease elimination campaign before the National Day. Wu Tieming, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, made a report. Before the radio conference, all districts held Party and government meetings to deploy action plans. The Dadong District, which had done a good job in summer sanitation, organized 400,000 people to participate in the assault. They had investigated the breeding places of flies and mosquitoes in the entire district in advance and carried out key encirclement and annihilation in twelve war zones. In the assault, the Huanggu District adopted the measures of three fixed (fixed points, fixed time, fixed personnel) and one package (contract to eliminate), and organized youth, women, and children into shock teams to carry out pursuit and annihilation. The Shenhe District established fly-swatting, mosquito-killing, and pest-elimination organizations at the district, street, committee, and group levels. The Heping District also organized many drug-killing maggot and insect-killing teams with streets as units. Each residents' committee also set up many "lure and kill points." The health and epidemic prevention stations in these two districts also trained many health disinfectants to lead the masses to disinfect all toilets. The Shenyang Patriotic Health Movement Committee decided to launch three mass sanitation movement climaxes to eliminate pests and diseases from the 10th to the 20th of this month, the 1st to the 10th of September, and the 20th to the 30th of September. It is required to thoroughly change the three aspects of fly, mosquito, and pest elimination, food hygiene, and environmental sanitation, and greet the National Day cleanly. (Lai Denong)

　　This newspaper reports that the autumn patriotic health movement in Nanjing is progressing smoothly. "Work hard in August and September to usher in a new climax of pest control and disease prevention, and greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day cleanly" is the action slogan of the citizens of Nanjing.

　　Early autumn is the time when disease-transmitting insects such as mosquitoes and flies breed and multiply in large numbers, and infectious diseases are prone to spread. Nanjing seized this critical opportunity and launched a comprehensive mosquito extermination war mainly with smoke fumigation on August 8th and 9th. Two days before this war, the city conducted a general survey and cleanup of breeding grounds, and before dawn and dusk, when outdoor mosquitoes were flying, captured adult mosquito warriors and launched a vigorous annihilation war. When the gongs sounded in the evening, smoke filled every household, carrying out a smoke-killing battle. On the 9th, each household also carried out a major cleanup, eliminating the remnants. In one fell swoop, about 67% of adult mosquitoes were killed, achieving fruitful results in the first round of autumn.

　　At the same time, Nanjing also carried out the prevention and treatment of intestinal infectious diseases. In addition to setting up various health lectures and short-term training courses in each street, health and art propaganda teams performed on the streets while people were resting in the cool of the evening, publicizing the common sense of eliminating mosquitoes and flies and paying attention to hygiene. The food and beverage industry departments ensured that there were daily inspections, daily records, and monthly evaluations, and more than 900 water wells were disinfected twice a day. In the spirit of "early prevention of diseases and early treatment of diseases," work was carried out to prevent dysentery. By the beginning of August, the incidence of dysentery in the whole district had decreased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year.

　　The second round of the autumn movement in Nanjing will be carried out from August 28th to 31st. From September 15th to 30th, a third health climax will be launched with cleaning as the main task, combining the elimination of mosquitoes and flies and carrying out large-scale environmental sanitation.

　　干干净净迎接国庆十周年
　　沪汉沈宁发动卫生突击战
    本报讯　上海市爱国卫生运动的第三次战役已经在全市展开。这次战役是采取分地区集中围歼和分散追击的方法，有重点有步骤地进行的。最近，全市和各区、县都先后召开了卫生积极分子大会和各种形式的动员会。区与区、街道与街道、工厂与工厂、各行业、各单位已纷纷签订竞赛评比协议，迅速掀起了卫生竞赛热潮。最近几天，从清晨到夜晚，随处可见捕打蚊蝇、清扫垃圾、填洼地、挖阴沟和喷撒杀虫消毒药水的人们。各区委书记、区长和人民代表、政协委员等都纷纷出动，深入基层单位和里弄，一面参加清扫和捕打蚊蝇，一面进行检查和宣传鼓动。
    在这次战役中，各地区、各单位特别注意采用有效办法消灭蚊蝇和控制蚊蝇孳生地。黄浦区最近发动了机关干部和居民一百多人组成突击队，在黄浦公园、儿童公园、外滩绿化地带结合消灭树虫、挖蛹，分班昼夜突击。和求新、新建、中华三个造船厂展开卫生友谊竞赛的江南造船厂，在党委书记厂长亲自带领下，各车间组织突击队，每天中午和下班以后轮流捕打蚊蝇、清除江边、路旁等地的杂草，并结合清理旧机件。厂内二百多所弃之不用的容易窝藏蚊蝇的草棚、木房、铁板房正在拆除。过去蚊蝇很多的提篮桥区咸菜、豆芽产销第一大组，为了消灭蚊蝇和蛆，把买来的酱经过煮熟消毒后再下缸，而且每只酱缸上都用纱布盖好。该组的咸菜封缸方法也有独到之处：先在菜上放一层草芭，草芭上加一层油纸，上面再放一层草芭，最上面加一层新鲜黄泥，黄泥上撒上石灰，缸边用盐水洗净。这样的密封方法，不但蚊蝇无隙可乘，还保证了菜的质量。
    各区、各单位和里弄通过竞赛评比检查，还修订和健全了清洁卫生制度，使群众性爱国卫生工作进一步经常化。
    经过一连几天的突击和全面检查以后，全市的卫生面貌有了进一步的改善。不少街道里弄、基本上达到了市的卫生鉴定标准。
    本报讯　武汉市人民鼓足干劲，积极筹备开展秋季卫生突击运动，以便干干净净迎接国庆节。
    今年夏季，武汉先后进行了两次卫生突击，取得了显著成绩。由于采用分片包干的办法，消除了一批臭水湖、塘和沟渠，已使蚊蝇的繁殖有所减少。如劳动街、水果湖街过去是蚊子成堆的地方，今年夏季可以不用挂蚊帐了。对饮食业和副食品的卫生工作也加强了管理，不少酱园、菜场无蝇无蛆。街道的环境卫生也有较大改善。但是由于有些单位的干部对这一工作不够重视，劲头还不大。为了进一步改善环境卫生，预防秋季疾病，武汉市委和市人委决定在8月20至25日开展全市性的第一次秋季卫生大突击。
    现在，各区、各系统已经行动起来，派专人调查蚊蝇孳生地，研究消灭或控制的具体措施。灭蚊、蝇需用的“六六六”烟熏剂等药物已大批准备就绪，正向居民分发供应。各区、街道已先后成立突击指挥部，研究卫生工作的措施。武昌、汉阳两个区并作出突击与经常化相结合的卫生工作规划。　（孙玉昌）
    本报沈阳19日电　沈阳市百万群众聚歼蝇、蚊和其他害虫，迎接国庆。这是沈阳市反对右倾松劲情绪，鼓足干劲，坚定信心，在国庆前组织的三次除害灭病群众卫生突击的第一次。
    沈阳市15日举行了聚歼蝇、蚊、害虫广播大会，全市一百多万人民组织了收听，沈阳市副市长宋光在会上宣读了中共沈阳市委、沈阳市人民委员会关于国庆前开展除害灭病运动的决定，中共沈阳市委书记吴铁鸣作了报告。广播大会前，各区都召开了党、政会议，布置行动计划。全市夏季卫生开展得较好的大东区组织了四十万人参加突击，他们事先就调查好了全区蝇、蚊孳生场所，分十二个战区进行重点围歼。皇姑区在突击中采取了三定（定点、定时、定人）、一包（包干消灭）的措施，并将青年、妇女、少年分别组织成突击队，进行追歼扑打。沈河区按区、街、委、组逐级建立了扑蝇、灭蚊、除虫组织。和平区还以街道为单位组织了许多药物杀蛆、杀虫队，各居民委员会还布下了许多“诱杀点”，这两个区的卫生防疫站还训练了许多卫生消毒员，带领群众，对全部厕所进行消毒。沈阳爱国卫生运动委员会决定在本月10日至20日，9月1日至10日，9月20日至30日，掀起三次除害灭病群众性卫生运动高潮。要求在消灭蝇、蚊、害虫，饭食卫生，环境卫生三个方面彻底改观，干干净净、迎接国庆。　（赖德农）
    本报讯　南京市的秋季爱国卫生运动正顺利展开。大干8、9月，掀起除害防病新高潮，做到干干净净迎接国庆十周年，这是南京市民的行动口号。
    初秋正是蚊蝇等病媒昆虫大量孳长繁殖、传染病容易流行的时候，南京市抓紧这个关键时机，在8月8、9两日掀起了以烟熏为主的综合灭蚊大战。在这次大战前两天，全市对孳生地就进行了普查清理，并在黎明和黄昏之前，家家户户的室外蚊虫飞舞时，捕捉成蚊战士，展开了轰轰烈烈的歼灭战。傍晚锣声响处，户户烟雾弥漫。开展了一场烟杀战斗。9日，各家又进行了大清扫，肃清残敌的工作。前后一举杀灭成蚊达67％左右，取得了秋季第一个回合的丰硕成绩。
    在此同时，南京市还开展肠道传染病的防治工作，每个街道除设立了各种卫生讲座和短期训练班之外，还趁人们黄昏纳凉休息的当儿，卫生文艺宣传队就在街头演出，宣传灭蚊蝇讲卫生的常识。饮食业部门做到天天有检查，日日有记录，月月有评比，九百余口水井每天消毒二遍。本着“无病早防，有病早治”的精神，开展了防止痢疾的工作。到8月上旬为止，全区痢疾发病率比去年同期下降了30％以上。
    南京市秋季运动的第二个回合，将于8月28日到31日进行。9月15日到30日以清扫为主掀起第三次卫生高潮，将结合消灭蚊蝇，大搞环境卫生。
