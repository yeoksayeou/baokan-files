Britain's "Great Power Status" and "Balance of Power" Policy
Pan Fei

(I)
I remember that after Macmillan became the British Prime Minister in January 1957, his first task was to deliver a speech against "defeatist" sentiments. At that time, Britain had just suffered a setback in the Suez Crisis, and many people were reflecting on the pain and discussing that Britain had declined into a second- or third-rate country. Macmillan's speech began by mentioning the issue of Britain's international status and denouncing the above-mentioned discussions as "nonsense." He said, "Britain was, is, and will always be a great power."
No one denies that, to this day, Britain remains the second most powerful country in the capitalist world, after the United States. Britain's position in the capitalist world is supported by the following factors: First, Britain is an industrially developed country. Second, Britain occupies a non-negligible position in international trade. (In 1958, its exports accounted for 9.5% of the total exports of the capitalist world, and its imports accounted for 10.6%.) Third, although the pound sterling has long lost its once-famous prestige, London remains the second financial center of the capitalist world. 40% of the capitalist world's foreign trade is paid for in pounds sterling. Fourth, Britain controls the Commonwealth. Britain is still the largest colonial empire. This makes it the largest controller of raw materials in the capitalist world. Fifth, apart from the United States, Britain has the largest navy and air force in the capitalist world. The fact that Britain possesses nuclear weapons reflects that it has a fairly developed scientific and technological foundation. Sixth, the British Labour Party is the leader of the Socialist Second International, the British royal family has a long-standing marriage relationship with some royal families in Western Europe; the British ruling class has accumulated rich experience in maintaining its overseas interests and is a master of power politics.
Britain has considerable economic strength and a certain influence on international affairs. This is only one side of the problem. On the other hand, Britain is rapidly declining and getting worse. From the Suez Crisis to now, it has been two years and nine months. During this period, many far-reaching changes have taken place in the international situation. The publication of the Moscow Declaration and the launching of Soviet artificial satellites marked a fundamental change in the balance of power between the two camps. Within the capitalist world system, a series of events have taken place from the Middle East to Africa, from Western Europe to Latin America, directly or indirectly conflicting with Britain. The question of "Is Britain a great power?" is even more prominent for the British ruling group than in the past.
Macmillan's assertion that Britain will remain a "great power" in the future is an unfounded inference. One can only understand his argument in this way: the struggle to maintain Britain's "great power" status is an urgent requirement of the British ruling class and the starting point of Britain's current foreign policy.

(II)
The true concept of maintaining Britain's "great power status" is to defend the vested political and economic interests of the British monopoly groups.
To achieve this goal, Britain has adopted a variety of methods.
In the relationship between the two camps, Britain pursues two policies. One is to follow the United States' anti-Soviet and anti-socialist countries' activities: from "Cold War" propaganda and blockade embargoes to the establishment of aggressive military alliances. On this point, the British ruling group exposed their class nature. Britain hopes that through this means, on the one hand, it can weaken the economic strength of the socialist camp and restrict its political influence; at the same time, it can stop the independence movements of colonial countries and the revolutionary movements within Western Europe. Britain's other policy is to prevent the United States and the Soviet Union from approaching each other alone, leaving Britain aside. What Britain is pursuing is that it can place itself between the United States and the Soviet Union and play a pivotal role.
Within the capitalist world, the guiding ideology of British foreign policy is based on the so-called "three regions theory." As early as 1948, Churchill elaborated on the argument that Britain should become the "central hub" of the capitalist world. He believed that within the capitalist world, Britain must maintain a "balanced" relationship favorable to itself in three regions. The first region is the "Commonwealth and Empire," that is, the relationship between Britain and the Commonwealth and colonies. The second region is the "English-speaking countries," that is, the relationship between Britain and the United States. The third region is "United Europe," that is, the relationship between Britain and Western European countries. Churchill said: "We are the only country that plays an important role in every region. In fact, we are a central hub... Therefore, we have the possibility of uniting all three regions. If we handle things skillfully, we are fully likely to regain the leading position." Shortly after the end of the Suez Crisis, Macmillan once again emphasized this argument, saying: "We people who live on this island are the founders of the great Commonwealth. We feel the closest relationship with it. The Commonwealth has a particularly important meaning for all of us in our daily lives. ...This is our first problem. Second, geographically and culturally, we are all Europeans. We cannot be separated from Europe, even if we want to. We are often moved by the constant efforts to strengthen the unity and unification of the Old World since the war. Third, we are members of the great alliance that connects the Old World and the New World across the Atlantic. ...We must pay attention to any of these three forces that often play a role in us at any time."
According to this guiding ideology, Britain has formed an alliance with the United States. Relying on this form of alliance, the United States is effectively eroding and infiltrating the British Empire. The extremely sharp contradictions between Britain and the United States are unfolding in this form of "cooperation." However, in order to contend with the socialist camp and to "stabilize" the collapsing British Empire, the Anglo-American alliance is still needed by the British ruling class.
According to this guiding ideology, Britain is doing its best to suppress and divide the colonial independence movement, and to curb the centrifugal tendency within the Commonwealth by strengthening economic ties. Britain's policy towards nationalist countries can also be broadly summarized in this category. In Kenya, Nyasaland, Cyprus... Britain has adopted the most barbaric policy of massacre. When armed suppression is no longer possible to consolidate Britain's colonial rule, it adopts the method of "granting" colonies independence in order to ease the resistance of the colonial people and continue to maintain Britain's effective control. Britain is good at using contradictions and creating opposition to divide or contain the anti-imperialist forces in these countries. The division of Malaya into two political units, Singapore and Malaysia, and the implementation of separate governance in Cyprus are all for this purpose. In Arab countries, Britain hopes that conflicts will occur between the United Arab Republic and Iraq.
According to this guiding ideology, Britain has adopted a policy of maneuvering and division towards Western European countries to prevent their integration. But on the other hand, Britain has played the greatest initiative and activeness in promoting the so-called "integration" of Western Europe, such as promoting the Marshall Plan, establishing the Western European Union, and organizing the North Atlantic Group. Britain's goal is to establish its own hegemony in Western Europe.

(III)
Britain summarizes its foreign policy as a diplomatic term: "Establishing the balance of power in the world." However, the objective world is always full of endless contradictions and struggles, and everything will never be in a state of eternal balance. Britain's tragedy lies here: the "balance of power" is broken time and time again, and Britain's international status is declining day by day.
The main factors leading to the decline of Britain's international status are: the law of uneven development of capitalism—the balance of power among imperialist countries is constantly changing; the upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle—it has accelerated the disintegration of this largest colonial empire; the United States' step-by-step encroachment on Britain—it has made Britain increasingly subordinate.
Although the British economy occupies a non-negligible position in the capitalist world, its industrial development is very slow compared with other countries. Its competitiveness in the world market is also much weaker than other countries. The years 1950-1956 were a period of relatively "stable" capitalist economy. In these seven years, West Germany's industrial production almost doubled, Italy increased by 62%, France increased by nearly 50%, while Britain only increased by about 21%. Except for Denmark, the industrial production growth rate of all Western European countries is much faster than that of Britain. The rapid recovery of the West German economy has made Britain's position as the second largest industrial power in the capitalist world precarious. West Germany's steel production exceeded Britain's in 1957; in terms of exports of industrial manufactured goods, West Germany surpassed Britain again in 1958 and ranked second in the capitalist world. After the Saar joins West Germany, West Germany's steel production this year will exceed Britain's by six or seven million tons.
The law of uneven development of capitalism has triggered a new combination of political forces in Western Europe. On the basis of the "Coal and Steel Community," the "Atomic Energy Community," and the "Common Market," the Paris-Bonn axis is gradually taking shape. The old "balance of power" has been broken, and Britain is increasingly being excluded from Western European affairs. The failure of the "Free Trade Area" plan, De Gaulle's demand to share the leadership of the "free world" with Britain, and Adenauer's public announcement that Britain has no right to interfere in Western European affairs—all of this marks that Britain has failed in the struggle for hegemony in Western Europe.
The upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle has shaken the foundation of the British Empire. There is no need to go back very far. Judging from the situation in the past two or three years alone, one can imagine how heavy a blow Britain has suffered in this regard. The Suez Crisis was an attempt by Britain to use force to block the tide of nationalism in the Middle East, and it ended in failure. The victory of the Iraqi revolution paralyzed the Baghdad Pact, which Britain had painstakingly managed for many years, almost overnight. The persistent struggle of the colonial people has forced Britain to make some concessions. For example, in recent years, it has allowed Ghana, Malaya, Cyprus, etc. to achieve varying degrees of independence.
The United States' policy of pursuing "world hegemony" has accelerated the process of Britain's decline. The United States has supported West Germany in Western Europe to become the core of the North Atlantic Group. In the struggle between the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area," the United States actively supports the former in order to expand its economic power. In the Middle East, the United States put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to "fill" the "vacuum" after Britain's failure. The American economy has smoothly penetrated into the British Commonwealth. Every "aid" from the United States to Britain has forced the latter to pay a heavy price.
In addition to the above reasons, Britain's decline also lies in the fact that the British ruling group has implemented a reactionary foreign policy. Isn't it an obvious fact that Britain has suffered a great loss in the blockade and embargo and weakened its position in the process of reviving West German militarism?

(IV)
After the Suez Crisis, especially after failing in the struggle for hegemony in Western Europe, how to maintain its "great power status" has become a major issue for the British ruling group to be solved urgently. It can be seen that since last year, Britain has begun to adjust its foreign policy in some aspects.
Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union in February this year was an important development in Anglo-Soviet relations after the war. Since then, Britain has repeatedly expressed its hope to convene a summit meeting. Britain's trade and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries have increased. The remarks of some British leaders have also changed significantly. As everyone knows, shortly after the end of the anti-fascist war, Churchill delivered his infamous Fulton Speech, the first to put forward the anti-Soviet program of the imperialist group. In a recent conversation, he advised people to be patient in East-West talks and to adopt a calm attitude. Marshal Montgomery used to advocate attacking the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons. Now, he advocates reducing troops in Central Europe to create the necessary atmosphere for discussing European security issues.
Anglo-Soviet relations have undoubtedly improved. However, this is very limited. During the Moscow talks, Britain had made suggestions on European security issues. However, it was not long before it continued to "revise" its views. By the time the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference began, Britain's suggestions had vanished. This shows that Britain does not have the courage to get rid of external constraints and pressures. In particular, the British ruling group has deep class prejudices against the socialist camp, and they are unwilling to abandon the "Cold War" policy. This is the fundamental reason that hinders the normalization of relations between Britain and the socialist camp.
Britain continues to follow the United States in opposing the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. Britain does not intend to change its policy of rearming West Germany, hoping to use this to balance the forces in Western and Eastern Europe. Britain is wholeheartedly pursuing the "two Chinas" conspiracy, vainly attempting to weaken the growing international influence of the People's Republic of China. This is the dominant aspect of Britain's relations with the socialist camp. But at the same time, Britain is trying to use its proximity to the Soviet Union to elevate itself, attack West Germany, and, when necessary, confront the United States. This practice of stabilizing Britain's international status by using external forces to achieve a "balance" is precisely a continuation of the "balance of power" policy. But as long as Britain does not make major changes in its foreign policy, it will not be possible to stop the decline of Britain's international status, which has long been proven by post-war history.

    英国的“大国地位”和“均势”政策
    潘非
    （一）
    记得1957年1月麦克米伦担任了英国首相之后，他的第一件工作是发表一篇反对“失败主义”情绪的演说。当时，英国刚在侵埃战争中翻了斤斗，许多人痛定思痛，议论着英国已下降为第二等或第三等国家。麦克米伦的演说一开始就提到英国的国际地位问题，并斥责上述的议论为“胡说”。他说：“英国过去是、现在是、而且将来也是个大国。”
    没有人否认：直到今天为止，英国仍是资本主义世界中仅次于美国的第二号国家。英国在资本主义世界中的地位，是依靠下列一些因素来支持的：一、英国是个工业发达的国家。二、英国在国际贸易中占着不可忽视的地位。（在1958年，它的输出占资本主义世界输出总额的9.5％，输入占10.6％。）三、英镑虽然早已失去了煊赫一时的声势，但伦敦仍是资本主义世界的第二个金融中心。资本主义世界中40％的对外贸易，是用英镑来支付的。四、英国控制着英联邦。英国迄今仍是最大的殖民帝国。这使它成为资本主义世界中最大的原料控制者。五、除美国以外，英国在资本主义世界中拥有最庞大的海军和空军。英国掌握了核武器这一事实，反映它具有相当发展的科学和技术基础。六、英国工党是社会党第二国际的领袖，英国的皇室同西欧一些皇室有着悠久的姻亲关系；英国的统治阶级在维护它的海外利益方面积累了丰富的经验，是玩弄权术的能手。
    英国拥有相当可观的经济实力，并且对国际事务有着一定的影响，这只是问题的一面。另一方面，英国正急剧衰落，每况愈下。从侵埃战争到现在，又有两年零九个月了。在这一段时期内，国际局势发生了许多影响深远的变化。莫斯科宣言的发表和苏联人造卫星上天，标志着两个阵营力量对比的根本改变。在资本主义世界体系内部，从中东到非洲，从西欧到拉丁美洲，发生了一系列的事件，直接地或间接地冲突着英国。“英国是不是个大国”这一问题，对英国统治集团来说，比过去更加突出了。
    麦克米伦肯定英国在将来仍然是个“大国”，这是没有根据的推断。人们只能这样来理解他的论点：为维护英国的“大国”地位而斗争，是英国统治阶级的迫切要求，是英国当前外交政策的出发点。
    （二）
    所谓维护英国的“大国地位”，它的真实概念，就是保卫英国垄断集团既得的政治和经济利益。
    为了达到这一目的，英国采取了多种多样的办法。
    在两个阵营的关系上，英国奉行着两条政策。一条是追随美国的反苏、反社会主义国家的活动：从“冷战”宣传、封锁禁运，一直到建立侵略性的军事同盟。在这一点上，英国统治集团暴露了他们的阶级本性。英国指望通过这一手段，一方面可以削弱社会主义阵营的经济力量和限制它们的政治影响；同时又可以制止殖民地国家的独立运动和西欧内部的革命运动。英国的另一条政策是防止美苏的单独接近，把英国甩在一边。英国所追求的是它能置身于美苏之间，扮演一个举足轻重的角色。
    在资本主义世界内部，英国外交政策的指导思想，奠立于所谓“三大区域论”之上。早在1948年，丘吉尔就发挥了使英国成为资本主义世界“总枢纽”的论点。他认为，在资本主义世界内，英国必须对三个地区保持有利于自己的“平衡”关系。第一个地区是“英联邦和帝国”即英国同联邦和殖民地的关系。第二个地区是“操英语的国家”，即英国同美国的关系。第三个地区是“联合起来的欧洲”，即英国同西欧国家的关系。丘吉尔说：“我们是在每一个区域里都起重要作用的唯一国家。实际上，我们是一个总枢纽……因此我们有可能把三个区域统统联合起来。如果我们的事情办得巧妙的话，我们完全有可能重执牛耳。”侵埃战争结束后不久，麦克米伦又一次强调这种论点，他说：“我们住在这个岛屿上的人，都是伟大的联邦的创始者。我们感到同它的关系最密切。联邦在我们的日常生活中，对我们所有的人都有着特别重大的意义。……这就是我们的第一个问题。第二，从地理和文化上来说，我们都是欧洲人。我们同欧洲是无法分开的，即使我们愿意。我们常为战后以来加强旧世界的团结和统一这种不断的努力所感动。第三，我们是联系横跨大西洋的旧世界和新世界的伟大联盟的一员。……对我们经常起作用的这三种力量中的任何一种，我们都不能不对之随时注意。”
    根据这一指导思想，英国同美国结成了联盟。依靠这一联盟的形式，美国对大英帝国进行着有效的蚕食与渗透。英美之间尖锐无比的矛盾，就是在这种“合作”的形式下展开的。但是，为了同社会主义阵营相抗衡，为了“稳定”瓦解中的大英帝国，英美联盟仍然是英国的统治阶级所需要的。
    根据这一指导思想，英国全力镇压与分化殖民地独立运动，并以加强经济联系的办法遏止英联邦内部的离心倾向。英国对民族主义国家的政策，大体上也可以概括在这一范畴之内。在怯尼亚、尼亚萨兰、塞浦路斯……英国采取了最野蛮的屠杀政策。当武装镇压已不可能巩固英国的殖民统治时，它就采取“赐与”殖民地独立的方式，以缓和殖民地人民的反抗，继续保持英国的有效控制。英国善于利用矛盾，制造对立，以分化或牵制这些国家的反帝力量。马来亚被分为新、马两个政治单位，塞浦路斯实行分治，都是为了这一目的。在阿拉伯国家，英国指望阿联同伊拉克之间发生冲突。
    根据这一指导思想，英国对西欧国家采取了纵横捭阖的手段，防止它们的结合。但另一方面，在推行马歇尔计划、成立西欧联盟、组织北大西洋集团等所谓促进西欧“整体化”的活动中，英国又发挥了最大的主动性和积极性。英国的目的，是要在西欧建立起自己的霸权。
    （三）
    英国把它的对外政策，概括成一个外交术语：“建立世界的均势”。但是，客观世界永远充满着无休止的矛盾和斗争，一切事物决不会处于永恒的平衡状态。英国的悲剧就在这里：“均势”一次又一次地被破坏，英国的国际地位一天比一天下降。
    导致英国国际地位江河日下的主要因素是：资本主义发展不平衡的规律——帝国主义国家间的力量对比在不断改变；反殖民主义斗争的高涨——它加速了这个最大的殖民帝国的瓦解；美国对英国的步步进逼——它使英国愈来愈处于从属地位。
    英国经济虽然在资本主义世界中占有不容忽视的地位，但同其他国家比较，它的工业的发展速度十分缓慢。它在世界市场上的竞争能力，也远比其他国家薄弱。1950—1956年，是资本主义经济比较“稳定”的时期。在这七年内，西德的工业生产几乎增加了一倍，意大利增加62％，法国增加将近50％，英国却只增加21％左右。除了丹麦以外，所有西欧国家的工业生产增长率，都要比英国快得多。西德经济的迅速恢复，已使英国作为资本主义世界第二个工业大国的地位岌岌可危。西德的钢产量已在1957年超过英国；在工业制成品的出口方面，西德又在1958年跨越英国而居资本主义世界的第二位。在萨尔并入西德以后，西德今年的钢铁产量，将超过英国六、七百万吨。
    资本主义发展不平衡的规律，引起了西欧政治力量的新的结合。在“煤钢联营”、“原子能联营”、“共同市场”这一基础上，逐步形成了巴黎—波恩轴心。旧的“均势”被打破了，英国愈来愈被排斥在西欧事务之外。“自由贸易区”计划失败，戴高乐要求同英国分享对“自由世界”的领导，阿登纳公开宣告英国已无权干预西欧事务——这一切，都标志着在争夺西欧霸权的斗争中，英国已告失败。
    反殖民主义斗争的高涨，动摇了大英帝国的基础。不需要回溯得很远，单从最近两三年的情况来看，可以想像到英国在这方面受到了多么沉重的打击。侵埃战争是英国企图以武力来堵塞中东民族主义潮流的一次尝试，结果以失败告终。伊拉克革命的胜利，使英国多年来苦心经营的巴格达条约集团，几乎在一夜之间陷于瘫痪。殖民地人民坚持不懈的斗争，迫使英国不得不作一些让步，例如在最近几年内，允许加纳、马来亚、塞浦路斯等取得不同程度的独立。
    美国追求“世界霸权”的政策，加速了英国衰落的过程。美国在西欧扶植西德成为北大西洋集团的核心。在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的斗争中，美国积极支持前者，以便扩张它的经济势力。在中东，美国提出了“艾森豪威尔主义”，“填补”英国失败后的“真空”。美国经济顺利地渗入英联邦内部。美国对英国的每一次“援助”，都迫使后者付出昂贵的代价。
    英国的衰落除了上述的几个原因外，还在于：英国统治集团执行了反动的对外政策。英国在封锁禁运中吃了大亏，在复活西德军国主义的过程中削弱了自己的地位，不都是明显的事实吗？
    （四）
    在侵埃战争后，特别是在争夺西欧的霸权中失败后，如何保持“大国地位”已成为英国统治集团急待解决的重大课题。可以看出，从去年以来，英国开始在某些方面调整其对外政策。
    今年2月麦克米伦访问苏联，是战后英苏关系的重要发展。自此以后，英国一再表示希望召开首脑会议。英国同苏联及东欧社会主义国家的贸易往来和文化交流，有了增加。英国某些领导人物的言论，也有显著的改变。大家知道，在反法西斯战争结束后不久，丘吉尔即发表了臭名昭著的富尔敦演说，第一个提出了帝国主义集团的反苏纲领。在最近一次的谈话中，他规劝人们在东西方会谈中要有耐心，要采取冷静的态度。蒙哥马利元帅过去一直鼓吹用核武器进攻苏联。现在，他主张减少在中欧的军队，为讨论欧洲安全问题创造必要的气氛。
    英苏关系无疑地有了改善。但是，这是非常有限度的。在莫斯科会谈时，英国曾对欧洲安全问题提出过建议。然而为时不久，它就不断地“修正”自己的观点。到日内瓦外长会议开始时，英国的建议已化为泡影。这说明英国没有魄力摆脱外来的牵制和压力。特别是，英国统治集团对社会主义阵营怀有深刻的阶级偏见，他们不愿意放弃“冷战”政策。这是阻碍英国同社会主义阵营关系正常化的根本原因。
    英国继续追随着美国反对苏联和社会主义阵营的政策。英国不打算改变重新武装西德的方针，指望以此来平衡欧洲西部和东部的力量。英国一心一意地推行“两个中国”的阴谋，妄想以此来削弱中华人民共和国日益增长的国际影响。这是英国对社会主义阵营关系上的主导的一面。但与此同时，英国又企图利用同苏联的接近，抬高自己，打击西德，以及在必要时对抗美国。这种利用外力的“平衡”，来稳定英国国际地位的作法，正是“均势”政策的继续。但英国一天没有在外交政策上作出重大的改变，就一天不可能阻遏英国国际地位的下降，这是早已为战后的历史所证明了的。
