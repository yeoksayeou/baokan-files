The Sanitary Red Flag Flies Over Tongren Vegetable Market
By Our Correspondent Wei Shun
    Tongren Vegetable Market excels in sanitation,
    The market is clean and bright on all six sides.
    The aroma of vegetables greets customers,
    Selecting fresh vegetables brings joy to the heart.
    This is the praise of the residents of Tongren Street, Nanjing, for the Tongren Street Vegetable Market.

    One ordinary summer morning, a cool breeze gently blows, the sun has not yet risen, and the Tongren Street Vegetable Market is already "dressing up." The members of the vegetable group are quickly removing vegetable peels and yellow leaves, discarding rotten melons and gourds. Some members are moving basket after basket of neatly arranged vegetables onto the sales shelves, then putting on white coats and masks. The members of the aquatic products group scrub the terrazzo fish tanks again and again, wipe them clean, fill them with half a tank of clear water, and then pour the fresh fish into the tanks. More than a dozen sanitation workers, holding dung baskets in their left hands and brooms in their right, sweep all the aisles and shelves clean, and fill the disinfection tanks, cleaning tanks, and washbasins with water... Once the "dressing up" is complete, the four gates are wide open, welcoming customers. Walking into this large vegetable market, the bright red tomatoes, tender green vegetables, edamame, peppers, winter melons, fragrant lotus roots, and other red and green colors on the shelves are eye-catching. Fresh fish swim in clear water. The flower fragrance in the elderly and pregnant women's rest room is pleasant, and the beds and chairs in the temporary nursery are clean and tidy. All of this makes you feel refreshed and comfortable.

    A sister-in-law, carrying a basket in one hand and holding a child in the other, came to the vegetable market's temporary nursery. The child stretched out both hands from afar to ask Aunt Cao, who works at the nursery, to hold him. When the mother came to pick up the child after buying groceries, the child's face had already been washed clean, and his little braids had also been tied. At parting, the child waved his little hand and said reluctantly, "Auntie, see you tomorrow!" The mother, while walking, gave the child the small cantaloupe she had just bought to eat, and just happened to hear the sanitation propaganda from the loudspeaker, "Dear customers! Summer is the most susceptible time for infectious diseases, especially gastrointestinal diseases.... Illness enters through the mouth. If customers buy melons and fruits to eat, they should be disinfected first. There are disinfection tanks in the aisles of the vegetable market for customers to use..." The sister-in-law quickly put the cantaloupe in the child's hand into the disinfection tank for disinfection, muttering in her mouth, "This vegetable market really thinks things through!" In the rest room, two purchasing agents who had finished buying vegetables were chatting leisurely while drinking tea. They are Old Chen and Old Liu from the Astronomical Instrument Factory and the Fourth Machinery Factory. While talking, Old Chen wanted to flick his cigarette ash, but he found that there was no ashtray on the table today. The table had a clean blue tablecloth, so he couldn't flick it on top. He was also embarrassed to flick it on the clean ground. In the end, he flicked it on a piece of paper. These two purchasing agents stay here for a while every day after buying vegetables. If they meet people who come to visit, they always enthusiastically promote to you, "Comrade, I have lived for more than fifty years, and I have never seen such a good and hygienic vegetable market! The varieties are complete, the colors are diverse, the vegetables are fresh, clean and hygienic..." They only feel satisfied when the listeners nod repeatedly and praise them again and again.

    At the back door of the vegetable market, several people are busy cleaning vegetables. They clean up the crushed melons and vegetables and the yellowed vegetable leaves to feed the pigs, and pickle the not-so-fresh vegetables. Comrade Li Changlin, the deputy director of the vegetable market, told reporters, "Most of the salespersons here have been trained and have general hygiene knowledge." At this time, I saw that the walls of the Tongren Street Vegetable Market were already covered with sanitary red flags. (Attached picture)

    同仁菜场卫生强，
    场内清洁六面光，
    菜香扑鼻迎顾客，
    挑选鲜菜心情畅。
    这是南京市同仁街居民对同仁街菜场的赞词。
    一个平常的夏日的清晨，凉风微拂，太阳还没有起身，同仁街菜场就在“打扮”了。蔬菜组的组员在迅速地削除菜皮和黄叶，剔去腐烂了的坏瓜，有的组员把一篮篮整齐的蔬菜搬到售货架子上，而后穿上白衣服，戴上口罩。水产组的组员把水磨石的鱼槽刷了又刷，擦了又擦，放进半池清水，再把鲜鱼倒进池子里。十来个保洁员，左手拿着粪箕、右手拿着扫帚，把各条走道、货架扫得干干净净，把消毒缸、清洗缸、洗手盆的水，一一添满……。“梳妆”已毕，四门大开，迎接顾客。走进这个宽大的菜场，那货架上鲜红的番茄、嫩绿的青菜、毛豆、辣椒、冬瓜、花香藕等红绿映衬。鲜鱼游在清水里。老人孕妇休息室里花香袭人，临时托儿站里的床椅，干净整齐。这一切，使你感到清新、舒畅。
    一位大嫂一手提篮，一手抱着一个小孩，来到菜场临时托儿站。孩子老远就伸着两手要托儿站的曹阿姨抱。妈妈买好菜来领孩子的时候，孩子的脸已经洗干净了，小辫子也扎好了。临别时，孩子挥着小手依依不舍地说：“阿姨，明天见！”妈妈一面走一面把刚买来的小香瓜给孩子啃，正巧听到了广播筒里的卫生宣传，“亲爱的顾客们！夏季最容易得传染病，特别是肠胃病……。病从口入，顾客们若是买瓜果吃，应当先消毒。菜场里过道上有消毒缸，供顾客使用……”这位大嫂连忙把孩子手里的香瓜放到消毒缸去消毒，嘴里还嘀咕着：“这个菜场想的可真周到啊！”在休息室里，两位买完菜的采购员正在品茶闲聊。他们是天文仪器厂和第四机械厂的老陈和老刘。谈着谈着老陈要弹烟灰，但他发现今天桌上没放烟灰缸。桌子上是洁净的蓝台布，当然不能弹在上面，弹在干净的地上，也不大好意思。最后还是弹在一张纸上。这两位采购员每天买完菜都要在这儿呆上一会。要是遇上来参观的人，他们总是那样热心地向你宣传：“同志啊，我活了五十多岁，从来没见到这么好而且卫生的菜场啊？品种全、花色多，蔬菜新鲜，干净卫生，……”一直说到听的人连连点头，声声夸奖，他们才感到满足。
    菜场后门口，还有几个人在忙着清理蔬菜。他们把压烂的瓜菜和发黄的菜叶清理下来去喂猪，把不新鲜的蔬菜腌咸菜。菜场副主任李昌林同志对记者说：“这儿大多数售货员都经过培训，都具有一般的卫生常识。”这时，我才看到同仁街菜场的墙上已经挂满了卫生红旗。（附图片）
