　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The All-China Women's Federation held an enlarged meeting of directors of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region women's federations in Beijing from July 27th to August 16th. The meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of women's work since 1958 and discussed the tasks of women's work in the future. The meeting unanimously agreed that the achievements of the women's movement since 1958 and the current favorable situation must be fully assessed. We must resolutely oppose the right-leaning conservative thinking of a small number of cadres who are afraid of difficulties and slacken their efforts. We must actively mobilize women to participate in the new upsurge of the production increase and savings movement, and together with the people of the whole country, continue to exert efforts, strive hard, and complete and overfulfill the 1959 production plan, and continue to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958.
　　The meeting held that since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, China's socialist construction has achieved an all-round great leap forward. The realization of people's communes in the vast rural areas is an extremely great achievement. Under this situation, China's women's movement has also achieved unprecedentedly great achievements. The vast number of women across the country have universally participated in industrial and agricultural production and other construction, and most women with labor ability have become social laborers. In 1958, the number of female workers nationwide increased by about double the total number of female workers in 1957; the new female workers added in 1958 were more than ten times the total number of female workers before liberation. A large number of housewives have participated in people-run industries and various collective welfare and service undertakings. In rural areas, almost all women with labor ability have participated in various labors of the people's communes. The scope of labor has expanded unprecedentedly, and production technology has also improved significantly. The labor days they do generally account for about 35% of the total labor days. In the past, most of them only participated in auxiliary labor, but now they have become a main force in agricultural production. With the needs of the all-round great leap forward in production and the great development of various production undertakings of the people's communes, and according to the urgent demands of the women themselves, collective living welfare undertakings have achieved rapid, universal, and large-scale development nationwide. Judging only from the children received by nurseries across the country, the number increased by more than seven times in 1958 compared with 1957, and judging from the children received by kindergartens across the country, the number increased by more than twenty-seven times in 1958 compared with 1957. Due to the large-scale establishment of canteens and nurseries, the socialization of housework has been gradually realized, which has saved a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, greatly reduced women's housework, enabled them to participate in production like men, and engage in political, cultural, and technical learning; enabled them to get necessary rest, improve their physical health; and can promote family harmony and enable children to receive relatively good upbringing. Therefore, the women wholeheartedly support these undertakings. The socialist consciousness of women has also been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the idea that labor is glorious has been firmly established. They enthusiastically participate in various labors and have developed the heroic spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Advanced activists are even more high-spirited. Wherever the Party points, they rush to. In various construction posts, they do not talk about conditions, do not fear hardship, fight heroically and arduously, and unite and lead the vast number of women to make remarkable achievements in production.
　　The meeting held that since last year, the large-scale participation of women in production labor has reflected the rapid development of China's productive forces. The heroic and conscious labor of the broad masses of women and their contributions have a significant promoting effect on the great leap forward in 1958, the continued leap forward in 1959, and the development of socialist construction. It is precisely because of their active participation in the great socialist construction through active labor that women can rapidly improve their ideological awareness and cultural and technical level; they are more respected and cared for in society and in the family. The great achievements of the women's movement in 1958 have enabled women to take a big step forward on the road to complete liberation. All this fully demonstrates the new look of the new stage of the women's movement in China's great socialist construction period. The acquisition of these achievements is inseparable from the great achievements of the nationwide and all-round great leap forward. This is something that has never happened in China's history and is beyond the reach of any capitalist country. The acquisition of all these achievements is the victory of the Party's general line for building socialism, and it is also a clear proof of the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes.
　　The meeting unanimously agreed that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of women cadres is high and their energy is sufficient. However, it must be seen that a right-leaning and slackening sentiment is growing among a small number of women's federation cadres. They neglect or underestimate the great achievements that have been obtained and underestimate the significance and role of the vast number of women participating in social labor last year. They lack a correct understanding and full estimation of the great development of collective welfare undertakings and their superiority. They do not understand that it is inevitable for mass movements involving hundreds of millions of people to produce certain shortcomings; and they do not see that the main problems in our work have been solved, our experience is richer, and our cause will move forward better. They even regard problems that have been solved as insurmountable difficulties. They do not try to complete tasks that are objectively permissible or can be completed through subjective efforts, and they adopt an attitude of fear of difficulties, retreat, or laissez-faire in their work. They do not encourage the masses, but deflate the masses. This right-leaning thinking and sentiment is completely wrong and must be thoroughly criticized and overcome, otherwise it will be detrimental to uniting and encouraging women's enthusiasm for production and will also be harmful to socialist construction.
　　The meeting unanimously agreed that the current situation in our country is very favorable and our cause is thriving. It is a situation of continuing to leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward last year. Under this excellent situation and favorable conditions, the current task of women's federations should be to unswervingly implement the Party's general line of exerting great efforts, striving for the upper reaches, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, continuing to exert great efforts, resolutely opposing any form of right-leaning and slackening sentiment, and further mobilizing women across the country from all aspects to actively participate in the new upsurge of the nationwide and all-round production increase and savings movement, to greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with brilliant labor achievements, and strive to complete and overfulfill the annual production plan.
　　The meeting held that all female workers must be mobilized to continue to work hard, work practically, and work cleverly, actively participate in the high-quality, high-yield, and savings movement, improve product quality and labor productivity, pay attention to saving raw materials, materials, fuel, power, and labor, cherish state property, and strive to reduce costs. Women in street-run industries should be mobilized to continue to organize and develop service-oriented undertakings, develop small commodity production and handicraft production, and better meet the needs of urban and rural people, in accordance with the principles of serving national industrial construction, serving agricultural production, and serving the people's lives, as well as the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings.
　　Rural female commune members should be mobilized to comprehensively and rationally implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, further study agricultural technology, improve labor efficiency and labor quality, and strive for an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture, according to the situation in their respective regions. At present, it is particularly necessary to resolutely fight against water, drought, and insect pests, establish the view that man will conquer nature, and do a good job in replanting and replanting in disaster areas, exert great efforts, overcome disasters, and strive for a bumper harvest. Rural women should also be mobilized to vigorously develop the breeding of pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc., and actively carry out diversified operations while doing a good job in agricultural production.
　　The meeting held that the central key to doing a good job in the production increase and savings movement is to implement technological innovation and technological revolution. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the universal learning of technology by women in various production posts, improve their technical proficiency, and develop the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and be brave in creating innovations. At the same time, they should strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge to create conditions for continuously improving their technical level. The meeting held that women's federation organizations should, in the socialist labor competition movement, organize women to carry out activities of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced" according to needs and possibilities. Various localities can further summarize experience and promote it on the basis of various competition movements that have been carried out, and combine it with the specific requirements of production increase and savings in regions, factories, and mines to push the movement to a new upsurge, and call on women to muster greater efforts and strive for greater achievements.
　　The meeting held that further carrying out the production increase and savings movement in rural areas is inseparable from consolidating the people's communes and giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes. The vast number of women in rural areas across the country wholeheartedly support the people's communes and love the people's communes. From their personal experience, they have realized the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes and realized that the road of people's communes is the road to the complete liberation of women. They deeply feel that without the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no happiness today, let alone long-term happiness in the future. They will always participate in the great socialist construction under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, along the road of the people's communes, and seek their own complete liberation. The meeting held that it is wrong to underestimate the awareness and enthusiasm of rural women. In the future, the awareness and enthusiasm of rural women should continue to be improved, and they should more actively respond to the various calls of the people's communes, complete the various production tasks of the people's communes, strengthen the sense of responsibility as masters, care for and cherish the interests of the people's communes, and strive to increase the wealth of the people's communes and fight for the consolidation of the people's communes.
　　The meeting unanimously agreed that the existing public canteens, nurseries, and other organizations must be rectified, consolidated, and improved according to the principle of "running them actively and implementing voluntariness" as instructed by the central government, and these organizations should be further developed according to the needs of production.
　　In order to adapt to the local production level and the different requirements of the masses, canteens, nurseries, and other organizations should adopt diverse and flexible methods. Special attention should be paid to the reform of tools and cooking utensils and technological innovation to save manpower, material resources, and food. At the same time, ideological education and professional learning for service personnel should be strengthened to help them improve work efficiency and improve service quality. The superiority of these collective living welfare undertakings should be shown by actively running canteens and nurseries to attract the masses to participate.
　　The meeting held that all women should also be mobilized to practice thrift and frugality. According to the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and managing the family with diligence and thrift, they should learn to live a planned life in order to adapt to the needs of the country's planned construction and steadily improve the standard of living in a planned way. Women should be educated to look at problems from China's poor and blank economic foundation and the population of 600 million, and understand that the slightest waste or the slightest saving in the family has a great impact on society and the country. Therefore, they should establish the view of living a rich life as a poor life. At present, it is necessary to take saving food as the center and practice thrift in all aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Living should be planned, with foresight and hindsight, supplementing deficits with surpluses, saving and storing, trickling streams flowing steadily, and leaving room for maneuver.
　　The meeting unanimously agreed that women's federation cadres must strengthen their learning, oppose right-leaning sentiments, further improve their political awareness and ideological level, and improve their work style and work methods. At all levels, women's federation cadres must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism theories and Chairman Mao's works, and study the Party's policies to improve their theoretical and ideological level and their sense of political responsibility. At present, it is especially necessary to study the People's Daily editorial of August 6, oppose right-leaning sentiments, exert great efforts, overcome difficulties in every possible way, and complete various tasks with full confidence, so that our socialist construction can be carried out more vigorously and more, faster, better, and more economically. Women's federation cadres should also continue to go deep into the grassroots level, implement the mass line in their work, closely contact the masses, care about the interests of the masses, and respect the principle of voluntary participation of the masses; continue to run experimental fields for production and work well, combine theory with practice, and also attach great importance to doing a good job in typical investigation and research. Reflecting the opinions and demands of the women to the Party committee and relevant parties should be regarded as one of the most important responsibilities of the women's federation organization.
　　The delegates attending the meeting unanimously stated that after returning to their respective regions, they must, under the absolute leadership of the Party committees at all levels, mobilize all women's federation cadres and women to exert great efforts and participate in the nationwide and all-round production increase and savings movement to strive for the realization of a continued great leap forward.

　　全国妇联扩大会议总结妇女工作成就部署当前工作
　　妇女们，热烈投入增产节约运动！
　　以辉煌的劳动成就迎接国庆，热爱人民公社，办好公共食堂和托儿组织，厉行节约勤俭持家
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会7月27日至8月16日在北京召开省、市、自治区妇联主任扩大会议，总结1958年以来妇女工作的成绩和经验，并讨论今后的妇女工作任务。会议一致认为，必须充分估计1958年以来妇女运动的成绩和当前的有利形势，坚决反对在一小部分干部中存在着的畏难松劲的右倾保守思想，积极动员妇女投入增产节约运动的新高潮，同全国人民在一起，继续鼓足干劲，努力奋斗，完成和超额完成1959年的生产计划，在1958年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进。
    会议认为1958年以来，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我国社会主义建设事业获得了全面大跃进。在广大的农村实现了人民公社化，成就是极其伟大的。在这种形势下，我国妇女运动也获得了空前巨大的成就。全国广大妇女普遍地参加了工农业生产和其他各项建设，大多数有劳动能力的妇女已经成为社会劳动者。1958年全国女职工人数比1957年的女职工总数增加了一倍左右；1958年增加的新女工，等于解放前女职工总数的十倍多。大量的家庭妇女参加了民办工业和各种集体生活福利、服务事业。在农村，有劳动能力的妇女几乎全部参加了人民公社的各种劳动，劳动范围空前扩大，生产技术也显著提高，她们所做的劳动日一般占到总劳动日的35％左右。她们过去多数只参加辅助劳动，现在已成为农业生产上的一支主力军。随着生产的全面大跃进和人民公社各项生产事业大发展的需要，并且根据妇女群众本身的迫切要求，集体生活福利事业在全国范围内获得了迅速、普遍、大量的发展。仅从全国托儿所收托的儿童来看，1958年比1957年增加了七倍多，从全国幼儿园收托的儿童来看，1958年比1957年增加二十七倍多。由于大量举办了食堂和托儿组织，逐步实现家务劳动的社会化，就节约了很多人力物力财力，大大地减轻了妇女的家务劳动，使她们能和男子一样参加生产，进行政治文化技术学习；使她们能够得到必要的休息，增进身体健康；并可以促进家庭和睦，使孩子受到比较良好的教养。所以妇女群众对于这些事业是衷心拥护的。妇女的社会主义觉悟也空前提高了，劳动光荣的思想巩固地树立起来了，她们欢欣鼓舞地参加各项劳动，发扬了敢想敢说敢作的英雄气概。先进的积极分子更是斗志昂扬，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里。在各个建设岗位上，不讲条件，不辞劳苦，英勇苦战，团结和带动广大妇女群众在生产上作出了显著成绩。
    会议认为去年以来，妇女大量参加生产劳动，反映了我国生产力的迅速发展。广大妇女群众的英勇自觉的劳动，和她们所作的贡献，对于1958年的大跃进，对于1959年的继续跃进，对于社会主义建设事业的发展，都具有重大的促进作用。正是由于通过积极的劳动来参与伟大的社会主义建设，妇女们才能迅速地提高思想觉悟和文化技术水平；她们在社会和家庭中，更加得到尊重和关怀。1958年妇女运动的伟大成就，使妇女在彻底解放的道路上，大大跃进了一步。这一切都充分表现了在我国伟大的社会主义建设时期的妇女运动新阶段的新面貌。这些成绩的获得是和全民全面的大跃进的伟大成绩分不开的，是我国历史上从来没有的，是任何资本主义国家望尘莫及的。这一切成就的获得，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，也正是人民公社无比优越的明证。
    会议一致认为广大妇女工作干部的革命热情是高的，干劲是足的。但必须看到在一小部分妇联干部中正滋长着一种右倾松劲情绪，她们忽视或者低估了已经获得的伟大成绩，对去年广大妇女参加社会劳动的意义和作用估计不足。她们对集体福利事业的大发展和它的优越性缺乏正确的认识和充分的估计。她们不懂得有几亿人民参加的群众运动，产生某些缺点是难免的；而且看不到我们工作中的主要问题已经得到了解决，我们的经验是更丰富了，我们的事业会更好地前进。她们甚至把已经解决了的问题，还当作不可克服的困难。她们对于本来是客观条件许可或经过主观努力可以完成的任务，也不去努力完成，在工作中采取畏难、退缩，或者放任自流的态度。她们不是鼓群众的劲，而是泄群众的气。这种右倾思想和情绪是完全错误的，必须彻底加以批判和克服，否则对团结一致鼓舞妇女的生产积极性是不利的，对社会主义建设也是有害的。
    会议一致认为我们国家当前的形势是十分有利的，我们的事业是兴旺的。是在去年大跃进的基础上继续大跃进的形势。在这种大好形势和有利条件下，当前妇联组织的任务应该是坚定不移地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的总路线，继续大鼓干劲，坚决反对任何形式的右倾松劲情绪，从各方面进一步动员全国妇女，积极投入全民全面的增产节约运动的新高潮，以辉煌的劳动成就，迎接伟大的国庆十周年，并且努力完成和超额完成全年生产计划。
    会议认为必须动员全体女职工，继续苦干、实干、巧干，积极参加优质、高产、节约运动，提高产品质量和劳动生产率，注意节约原料、材料、燃料、动力和劳动力，爱护国家的财产，努力降低成本。要动员街道民办工业中的妇女，本着为国家工业建设、为农业生产服务，和为人民生活服务的方针，以及勤俭办一切事业的精神，继续组织和发展服务性的事业，发展小商品生产和手工业生产，更好地满足城乡人民的需要。
    应当动员农村女社员，根据本地区的情况，全面合理地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，进一步学习农业技术，提高劳动工效和劳动质量，争取农业的全面大丰收。当前特别要坚决同水、旱、虫灾作斗争，树立人定胜天的观点，受灾地区要做好抢种补种工作，鼓足干劲，战胜灾荒，争取丰收。还要动员农村妇女在搞好农业生产的同时，大力发展猪、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等的饲养，积极开展多种经营。
    会议认为，搞好增产节约的中心关键是实行技术革新和技术革命，因此要促进各个生产岗位上的妇女普遍地学习技术，提高技术的熟练程度，并发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，勇于创造革新。同时努力学习文化和科学知识，为不断提高技术水平创造条件。会议认为，妇联组织应当在社会主义劳动竞赛运动中，根据需要和可能，组织妇女群众开展“学先进、赶先进”的活动，各地可在已经开展的各种竞赛运动的基础上进一步总结经验，加以推广，结合地区、厂矿增产节约的具体要求，把运动推向新的高潮，并且号召妇女鼓起更大的劲头，争取更大的成绩。
    会议认为，进一步开展农村的增产节约运动，是和巩固人民公社，充分发挥人民公社的优越性分不开的。全国农村中的广大妇女，是衷心拥护人民公社、热爱人民公社的。她们从亲身体验中，认识了人民公社的无比优越性，认识到人民公社化的道路就是妇女彻底解放的道路。她们深深感到，没有党和毛主席的领导，就不会有今天的幸福，更不会有将来长远的幸福。她们将永远在党和毛主席的领导下，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，沿着人民公社的道路，参加伟大的社会主义建设，并求得自身的彻底解放。会议认为，低估农村妇女的这种觉悟和热情，是错误的。今后应当继续提高农村妇女的觉悟和积极性，更积极地响应人民公社的各项号召，完成人民公社的各项生产任务，加强主人翁的责任感，关心和爱护人民公社的利益，努力增加人民公社的财富，为巩固人民公社而斗争。
    会议一致认为必须根据中央指示的“积极办好，贯彻自愿”的原则，对已有的公共食堂、托儿组织等进行整顿、巩固和提高，并根据生产的需要，进一步发展这些组织。
    为适应当地的生产水平和群众不同的要求，食堂、托儿组织等要采取多样、灵活的方式。特别要注意工具、炊具的改革和技术革新，节约人力、物力，节约粮食。同时，要加强服务人员的思想教育和业务学习，帮助她们提高工效，提高服务质量。应当通过积极办好食堂和托儿组织，显示这些集体生活福利事业的优越性，来吸引群众参加。
    会议认为还要动员全体妇女厉行节约，根据勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的精神，学会有计划地过日子，以适应国家有计划的建设的需要，和有计划稳步地提高生活水平。教育妇女要从我国一穷二白的经济基础和六亿人口出发看问题，懂得家庭的点滴浪费或点滴节约，对社会和国家都有很大影响。因此要树立富日子当穷日子过的观点。目前要以节约粮食为中心，在食、衣、住、行各方面厉行节约。过日子要有计划，要瞻前顾后，以丰补欠，节约储蓄，细水长流，留有余地。
    会议一致认为，妇联干部必须加强学习，反对右倾情绪，进一步提高政治觉悟和思想水平，改进工作作风和工作方法。各级妇联干部，必须刻苦学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛主席的著作，学习党的政策，以提高理论思想水平和政治责任心。当前特别要学习人民日报8月6日的社论，反对右倾情绪，鼓足干劲，千方百计地克服困难，信心百倍地完成各项任务，使我们的社会主义建设事业，进行得更加轰轰烈烈和多、快、好、省。妇联干部还要继续深入下层，在工作中贯彻执行群众路线，密切联系群众，关心群众利益，尊重群众自愿的原则；继续办好生产和工作的试验田，使理论与实际相结合，并且还要十分重视做好典型调查研究工作。应当把向党委和有关方面反映妇女群众的意见和要求，作为妇联组织最重要的职责之一。
    到会代表一致表示：回到各地区后，一定要在各级党委的绝对领导下，动员全体妇联干部和妇女群众一道，鼓足干劲，投入全民全面的增产节约运动，为实现继续大跃进而奋斗。
