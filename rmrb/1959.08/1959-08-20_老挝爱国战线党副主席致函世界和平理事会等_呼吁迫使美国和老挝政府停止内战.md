Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 19th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency today, the "Lao Patriotic News" recently published a letter from Faydang Lobliayao, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, to the World Peace Council and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council on August 10th. The letter called on the two international organizations to actively help improve the current serious situation in Laos.

	In the letter, Faydang requested the two international organizations to take urgent measures to force US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government to immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other detained leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, immediately stop the civil war in Laos, and restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, to thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

	After listing a series of evil deeds of US imperialism in interfering in Laos' internal affairs since the restoration of peace in Indochina, the letter emphasized that recently, the Phoui Sananikone government, following the orders of US imperialism, launched a full-scale attack on Lao patriotic and progressive forces, issued the so-called July 23rd joint communiqué of the Pharaoh, allowed US military personnel to openly stay in Laos, and imported large quantities of new US military personnel and weapons into Laos.

	The letter went on to say that, at the same time, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the South Vietnamese authorities are taking the opportunity to step up preparations to strengthen their aggression and military intervention in Laos in various forms. In order to cover up the blatant interference of US imperialism in Laos and to deal with the Lao people's widespread struggles against mopping-up operations and persecution, the Phoui Sananikone government has clamorously slandered neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China for interfering in Laos.

	The letter pointed out that the above-mentioned rebellious actions of the Lao Kingdom authorities are aimed at expanding the civil war, using force to eliminate Lao patriotic and progressive forces, attempting to steal the fruits of the Lao people's national liberation struggle, and turning Laos into a military base for US imperialism in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

	The letter said that the actions of US imperialism in instigating the Phoui Sananikone government to arrest Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party on July 28th have made the situation in Laos unprecedentedly serious.

	The letter emphasized that US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone authorities thought that their above-mentioned actions could extinguish the Lao people's patriotism and fighting will. However, they were wrong. The Lao people, who had defeated the French colonialists in a long and arduous war of resistance, will never yield to US imperialism and forgive their ambitious crimes.

	With the sympathy and support of peace-loving people in Asia, Africa, and the world, the Lao people will always firmly hold high the banner of peace and neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity. Justice will surely triumph, the Lao people will surely triumph, and US imperialism and its running dogs will surely suffer defeat.

### 老挝爱国战线党副主席致函世界和平理事会等　呼吁迫使美国和老挝政府停止内战

    老挝爱国战线党副主席致函世界和平理事会等
　　呼吁迫使美国和老挝政府停止内战
    新华社河内19日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，“老挝爱国报”最近刊登了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席费当8月10日写给世界和平理事会和亚非人民团结理事会的信，信中呼吁这两个国际组织积极地帮助改进老挝目前的严重局势。
    费当在信中要求这两个国际组织采取紧急措施，迫使美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和被拘禁的老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由、立即停止老挝内战和恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，彻底地和严格地履行日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    这封信在列举了美帝国主义自从印度支那和平恢复以来干涉老挝内政的一系列罪恶行为以后强调指出：近来，萨纳尼空政府遵从美帝国主义的命令，全面地进攻老挝爱国和进步力量，发表了7月23日的法老联合公报，让美国军事人员公开地呆在老挝，并且输入老挝大批新的美国军事人员和武器。
    信中接着说，与此同时，东南亚侵略集团和南越当局正在趁机加紧准备，以种种形式来加强对老挝进行的侵略和军事干涉。萨纳尼空政府为了掩盖美帝国主义对老挝的明目张胆的干涉，和对付老挝人民遍及各地的反扫荡、反迫害的斗争运动，竟大叫大嚷地污蔑越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国等邻国干涉老挝。
    信中指出，老挝王国当局上述的叛逆行为，目的在于扩大内战、用武力消灭老挝爱国和进步力量，妄图窃取老挝人民的民族解放斗争的成果，把老挝变成美帝国主义在印度支那和东南亚的军事基地。
    信中说，美帝国主义唆使萨纳尼空政府在7月28日逮捕了苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的行动，使得老挝局势变得空前严重。
    信中强调指出，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空当局以为他们上述的行为可以扑灭老挝人民的爱国心和战斗意志。可是，他们想错了。曾经在长期艰苦的抗战中战胜法国殖民者的老挝人民，决不会向美帝国主义屈服和宽恕他们的野心罪行。
    在亚非和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，老挝人民将永远坚决地高举和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的旗帜，正义一定胜利，老挝人民一定胜利，美帝国主义和它的走狗一定遭受失败。
