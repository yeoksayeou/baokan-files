Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 13th: The Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) delegation and the Japanese Red Cross Society delegation formally signed an agreement in Calcutta today regarding the repatriation of pro-North Korean residents in Japan to the DPRK.

Lee Il-kyeong, Vice Chairman of the DPRK Red Cross Society, and Kaji Kasai, Vice President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, signed the agreement on behalf of their respective Red Cross societies.

The agreement stipulates that Japan will repatriate pro-North Korean residents in Japan who express a desire to leave Japan and return to the DPRK. Currently, more than 600,000 Korean residents live in Japan.

According to the agreement, the work of repatriating Korean residents will begin within three months from today. The Japanese Red Cross Society will arrange transportation for Korean residents who wish to return home from their current residences in Japan to the port of embarkation. The DPRK will then arrange their sea transport.

Korean residents in Japan have long and urgently requested to return to the DPRK. This agreement was signed after long-term efforts by the Korean side and after lengthy negotiations with the Japanese side in Geneva starting in April this year.

In an interview with a reporter from the Press Trust of India, Korean representative Lee Il-kyeong said that the signing of this agreement was the result of negotiations between the Red Cross societies of the DPRK and Japan in Geneva. He said that this is an important issue related to the survival of thousands of Korean residents in Japan. These Korean residents have lost their livelihoods and are currently suffering from hunger and poverty.

Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: According to TASS, Tokyo: The news that representatives of the Red Cross societies of the DPRK and Japan signed an agreement in Calcutta today on the repatriation of pro-North Korean residents in Japan to the DPRK has been warmly welcomed by Korean residents in Japan.
