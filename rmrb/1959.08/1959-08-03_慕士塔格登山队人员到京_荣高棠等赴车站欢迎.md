    新华社2日讯　北京市的青年与学生今天热烈欢迎胜利归来的中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队人员。
    由登山队队长许竞率领的这一批登山队人员共三十人。当他们今天上午到达北京下火车以后，国家体委副主任荣高棠、中华全国总工会书记处书记张修竹、全国妇联书记处书记杨蕴玉、北京市体委主任张青季和北京地质学院、北京大学等单位的代表，都上前同他们亲切地握手。北京地质学院、北京大学、北京体育学院的学生们还跑上前向他们献了花。
    登山队队员今天个个兴高采烈。藏族女队员尺来说，她们还是第一次来到北京，感到非常高兴。登山队员们虽然经过一段时间休息，但是在登山中被雪光反射成黝黑的皮肤颜色仍然没有完全退掉。
    登山队第一批人员十人，已经在早一些时候到达北京。登山队其余人员，将在晚一些时候押运登山队物资来北京。
