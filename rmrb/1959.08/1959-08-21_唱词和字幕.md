　　Lyrics and Subtitles
　　Fang Ping
    A few years ago, I saw some local operas where the music was good and the actors sang well, but I couldn't understand the lyrics, which made it difficult to appreciate. Later, some opera genres and troupes started projecting the lyrics onto the screen as subtitles during performances, which solved the problem of not understanding.

    However, we encounter the same situation at concerts. Sometimes, when singers perform on stage, the audience can't clearly hear the lyrics, especially in choral performances, where it's even harder to understand. A few years ago, we often heard accusations like: "So-and-so singer's pronunciation is unclear," "So-and-so choir's pronunciation is unclear," and so on. At that time, there were indeed problems in this regard, but it was only one aspect. There were also other issues, such as: the language of poetry can sometimes be convoluted and implicit, not exactly the same as everyday spoken language. Moreover, due to the musical arrangement of choral lyrics, it's not so easy for listeners to understand everything clearly at once.

    Once, while discussing this with some comrades, we felt that musical performances at concerts could also utilize subtitles, just like some opera performances. This would be very beneficial. First, it would make it easier to understand the lyrics while listening to the song. Second, understanding the lyrics would make it easier to appreciate the music and comprehend its interest and artistry. Third, it would make it easier for listeners to learn along. Frankly speaking, using subtitles at concerts would both popularize music and culture among the masses, which can truly be considered killing two birds with one stone. Just look at movie songs – they spread so easily among the masses. The large audience of movies is certainly the main reason, but I think the contribution of subtitles is also significant!

    Recently, I attended a concert by the South China Soldiers' Song and Dance Troupe and saw that they used subtitles, and the effect was excellent. After seeing their performance, I was emboldened to raise this issue. I suggest that all concerts, especially mass concerts, should use subtitles! If the lyrics are projected onto the screen using slides, the songs sung at concerts will have more robust wings and will fly faster and farther among the masses.

　　唱词和字幕
　　放平
    前几年我看到一些地方戏曲，音乐好，演员唱得也好，就是不懂台上唱的什么内容，欣赏起来很吃力。后来有些剧种和剧团；演出的时候，把唱词用幻灯打在字幕上，听不懂的问题就解决了。
    可是在音乐会上，我们也碰到同样的情况。有些歌唱家在舞台上唱歌，听的人有时候会听不清楚歌词，特别是合唱，听不清楚的地方就更多了。前几年，我们常常听到这样的指责：某某歌唱家吐字不清楚，某某合唱队吐字不清楚等等。那时候这方面的问题并不是没有，但到底只是一方面。可是也还有另外的问题，比如：诗歌的语言有时会用得曲折，含蓄，不可能跟日常的口语一模一样。再说，合唱歌词由于音乐上的处理，听的人也不是那么容易一下子全都听得清清楚楚的。
    有一次和几个同志谈起，觉得音乐会上的音乐演出，也可以像一些戏曲的演出一样，把字幕利用起来，这样很有好处，第一，使人看词听歌，容易懂；第二，懂了唱词，更便于欣赏音乐，领会音乐里面的意趣和艺术；第三，便于听的人跟着学。说实在话，音乐会用字幕，在群众中既普及了音乐，又普及了文化，真可算得一箭双雕了。试看电影歌曲，它们那么容易在群众中流传，电影的观众多，固然是一个最主要的原因，我看字幕的功劳却也不小哩！
    最近听了华南战士歌舞团的音乐会，看到他们就采用了字幕，效果很好。看了他们的演出以后，倒鼓起我提出这个问题的勇气来了。我建议：让所有的音乐会，特别是群众性的音乐会，都采用字幕吧！把歌词用幻灯打出来，音乐会上唱出来的歌曲，翅膀就会更矫健，在群众中就会飞翔得更快一些和更远一些了。
