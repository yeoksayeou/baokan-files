    On the Serious Situation in Laos

    Under the instigation of the United States, the Lao government of Phoui Sananikone has brazenly abandoned the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, provoked civil war, and destroyed the peaceful situation in the country. Now, the United States is plotting to further expand the civil war by the Sananikone government. The Lao authorities have openly announced the arrest of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, persecuting Lao Patriotic Front personnel on a large scale, and launching large-scale military "sweeps" in many areas. The situation in Laos is becoming more tense and deteriorating.

    In order to cover up the truth and escape culpability, the United States and the Lao authorities have launched a slander and smear campaign against China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in recent days. The US State Department spokesperson issued statements on July 30, August 1, and August 11, claiming that the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, with the support of so-called "communist conspirators on the Lao border," had violated the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements; and that the outbreak of the Lao civil war was a "serious crisis" provoked by "Communist imperialists." The Lao authorities also echoed these sentiments with communiqués and statements on August 3 and 4, falsely accusing the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of "attacking" the Lao border. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on August 5, vehemently denouncing this despicable trick of the US imperialists and the Lao authorities in distorting the truth about the situation in Laos. Today, this newspaper publishes a statement by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, once again sternly condemning and exposing this shameful act of the US imperialists and the Lao authorities in distorting the truth about the Lao situation.

    It is a well-known fact that US imperialism has long plotted to interfere in Laos, undermine the Geneva Accords, and disrupt peace in the Indochina region. Shortly after the signing of the Geneva Accords, US imperialism launched a frantic campaign to undermine them in Laos. In September 1954, US imperialists instigated pro-American elements in Laos to assassinate Kou Voravong, the then Minister of National Defense of Laos, who had been striving to negotiate with the Pathet Lao fighting forces and earnestly implement the Geneva Accords. Subsequently, the United States tried every possible means to undermine and obstruct the negotiations between the Lao government of Souvanna Phouma and the Pathet Lao fighting forces, causing the talks to be interrupted seven times. In November 1957, the government of Souvanna Phouma and the Pathet Lao fighting forces finally overcame numerous obstacles and reached the Vientiane Agreements based on the principles of the Geneva Accords. According to this agreement, Laos established a coalition government with representatives of the Pathet Lao fighting forces. However, the United States used various shameless means to blatantly interfere in Laos' internal affairs, preventing Laos from following the path of national independence, peace, and neutrality in accordance with the Geneva Accords. US imperialist interference forced the Souvanna Phouma cabinet to step down, to be replaced by the extremely pro-American, reactionary, and anti-Geneva Accords Phoui Sananikone government. Representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front were excluded from the cabinet, the coalition government disintegrated, and Patriotic Front members and other patriots were subjected to frantic persecution. Large amounts of US military supplies and personnel poured into Laos. Robert Robertson, former Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, admitted with considerable satisfaction in a secret testimony to the US Congress that US interference in Laos was its "most successful plan in the world," and he unreservedly said: "Let us look at the situation today. They (the pro-American faction in Laos) have expelled two communists in the government…".

    The recent sharp deterioration of the situation in Laos is the result of US planning. In February this year, Phoui Sananikone openly declared that he was no longer "bound" by the Geneva Accords, and US State Department officials immediately issued statements in support, openly stating that the United States could henceforth "freely" establish a military mission in Laos. In April, US imperialism formulated a so-called "blueprint" for intervention in Laos at the SEATO meeting in Wellington. Thus, the Sananikone government took action in May to implement this plan, deploying troops to surround two battalions of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces and placing the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front under house arrest. Lao Foreign Minister Phanya even clamored to "eliminate them (the former Pathet Lao fighting forces) if they refuse to surrender." In this way, the Lao authorities finally provoked a civil war. Now the US State Department and the Lao authorities are trying to cover up their guilt of undermining the Geneva Accords and instigating the Lao civil war with statements full of lies, but this is simply impossible.

    US instigation of the Lao civil war, which continues to worsen the situation in Laos, is aimed at further controlling Laos and completely turning it into a US military base. While expanding the civil war and intensifying the suppression of the Lao patriotic people, the Sananikone government signed an agreement with the French government, openly requesting US military personnel to "train" the Lao army. Recently, large numbers of US military personnel and supplies have been entering Laos, intensifying the control of the Lao army. According to Reuters, the United States has begun replacing the US equipment used by the Lao army, and more than 100 US military personnel have entered Laos since July 25. At the same time, the United States is plotting a major conspiracy for Thailand, a member of SEATO, and the Ngo Dinh Diem group of South Vietnam to carry out military intervention in Laos. According to Bangkok newspaper reports, the Military Committee of the eight SEATO member states held a meeting and even studied sending troops to "aid" the Sananikone government in intensifying the civil war. Thai Defense Minister Luang Swasdi publicly said that Thailand "is ready with its strength and can send aid to Laos at any time." All of this shows that US imperialism is actively plotting new conspiracies, trying to expand the Lao war, internationalize the Lao civil war, and thus threaten the peace and security of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is one of the main countries in Indochina, and is closely related to the other countries of Indochina. The People's Republic of China is Laos' neighbor. Both China and Vietnam are participants and signatories to the Geneva Conference and the Geneva Accords, and therefore the people of China and Vietnam cannot but express serious concern about this dangerous activity planned by US imperialism in Laos. The US State Department's statement claimed that Laos, with only two million people, could not threaten the security of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is complete sophistry. It is very clear that there is a traditional friendship between the peoples of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Laos, and Laos itself will never threaten China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, just as China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam do not pose a threat to Laos. The problem now is that US imperialism is interfering in and controlling Laos, trying to turn Laos into its military base, which brings the US imperialist military threat directly to the borders of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Therefore, as the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out in his statement, the US State Department and the Lao Phoui Sananikone government should bear full responsibility for the current serious situation in Laos. Only if the United States and the Sananikone government cease all measures to undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, withdraw all US military personnel and arms in Laos, remove all US military bases, restore the normal supervisory activities of the International Commission, and thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, can the tense situation in Laos created by the United States be eliminated. There is no other way. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs also pointed out that the United States and the Sananikone government are brewing to submit the Lao issue to the United Nations, attempting to cover up US aggression against Laos through the "intervention" of the United Nations. Maintaining the Geneva Accords is clearly the common obligation of both sides of the ceasefire in Laos and the countries concerned, and the United Nations has no right to interfere at all. The so-called "intervention" by the United Nations is itself a violation and contempt of the Geneva Accords. This is of course not permissible.

    The Chinese people are closely watching the development of the situation in Laos. The Chinese people unanimously support the just demands of the Lao Patriotic Front and the solemn statement of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded the US government and the Lao authorities in his statement that all their activities in violation of the Geneva Accords and creating tension in Indochina, and thus threatening China's security, will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Chinese government and people, and the US government and the Lao authorities must bear all the consequences arising from these activities.

    评老挝的严重局势
    老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国唆使下，悍然废弃日内瓦协议和万象协议，挑起内战，破坏了国内的和平局面。现在，美国正策动萨纳尼空政府进一步扩大内战。老挝当局公然宣布逮捕苏发努冯亲王等老挝爱国战线党的领袖，大肆迫害老挝爱国战线党人员，并在许多地区发动大规模的军事“扫荡”。老挝的局势是更加紧张和恶化了。
    为了掩盖事实真相和逃避罪责，美国和老挝当局这几天发动了对中国和越南民主共和国的诽谤和诬蔑运动。美国国务院发言人在7月30日、8月1日、8月11日连续发表声明，说什么前寮国战斗部队在所谓“老挝边界那边的共产党同谋者的支持下”，破坏了日内瓦协议和万象协议；而老挝内战的爆发竟是什么“共产帝国主义者”所挑起的一次“严重危机”。老挝当局也在8月3日、4日发表公报和声明随声附和，诬蔑越南民主共和国的军队“进攻”了老挝边境。对于美帝国主义和老挝当局的这种颠倒黑白、含血喷人的卑鄙伎俩，越南民主共和国外交部已经在8月5日发表声明予以痛斥。今天，本报发表了我国外交部发言人的谈话，再一次严正地谴责和揭露了美帝国主义和老挝当局的这种歪曲老挝局势真相的可耻行为。
    美帝国主义干涉老挝，破坏日内瓦协议和印度支那地区的和平，蓄谋已久，这已是众所共知的事实。在日内瓦协议签订后不久，美帝国主义就在老挝展开了破坏日内瓦协议的疯狂活动。1954年9月，美帝国主义者指使老挝亲美分子刺杀了当时竭力主张与寮国战斗部队举行谈判、切实履行日内瓦协议的老挝国防大臣古·沃拉冯。之后，美国千方百计破坏和阻挠老挝富马政府同寮国战斗部队的谈判，而使双方的会谈曾七次陷于中断。1957年11月，富马政府与寮国战斗部队终于冲破重重阻力，根据日内瓦协议的原则达成了万象协议。按照这个协议，老挝成立了有寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府。但是，美国又使用种种无耻手段，露骨地干涉老挝内政，阻挡老挝遵循日内瓦协议走向民族独立与和平中立的道路。美帝国主义的干涉迫使富马内阁下台，而代之以极端亲美反动和仇视日内瓦协议的培·萨纳尼空政府。老挝爱国战线党的代表被排斥于内阁之外，联合政府解体了；爱国战线党人和其他爱国人士遭到了疯狂的迫害。大量的美国军事物资和军事人员涌入老挝。对于这一切，前美国远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊曾在美国国会秘密作证时颇为得意地供认，美国干涉老挝是它在“世界上最成功的计划”，他毫不隐讳地说：“让我们就看一看今天的情况吧。他们（老挝亲美派）驱除了两名在政府中的共产党人……”。
    最近几个月老挝局势的急剧恶化，就是美国一手策划的结果。今年2月间，培·萨纳尼空公开声明不再受日内瓦协议的“约束”，美国国务院官员立即发表声明加以支持，并且明目张胆地表示，从此美国可以“自由地”在老挝设立军事使团。4月间，美帝国主义在东南亚集团的惠灵顿会议上制订了干涉老挝的所谓“蓝图”，于是萨纳尼空政府在5月间便动手执行这个计划，调集兵力，包围前寮国战斗部队两个营，软禁了老挝爱国战线党的领导人。老挝外交大臣班雅并且大叫“消灭他们（前寮国战斗部队），如果他们拒绝投降的话”。就这样老挝当局终于挑起了内战。现在美国国务院和老挝当局企图以满纸谎言的声明，来掩盖它们破坏日内瓦协议和策动老挝内战的罪责，是根本办不到的。
    美国策动老挝内战，使老挝局势继续恶化，是为了进一步控制老挝，把老挝完全变成美国军事基地。萨纳尼空政府在扩大内战、加紧镇压老挝爱国人民的同时，同法国政府签订了一项协定，公然要求美国军事人员“训练”老挝军队。最近，美国军事人员和军事物资正大批进入老挝，加紧控制老挝的军队。据路透社说，美国已经开始更换老挝军队使用的美国装备，从7月25日起就有一百多名美国军事人员进入了老挝。同时，美国正在策划东南亚条约组织成员国的泰国以及南越吴庭艳集团对老挝进行军事干涉的重大阴谋。据曼谷报纸消息，东南亚条约组织八国军事委员会召开了会议，甚至研究派遣军队“援助”萨纳尼空政府加紧内战。泰国国防部参谋长銮沙越公开说，泰国“已准备好实力，随时可以出动援助老挝”。所有这些都表明，美帝国主义正在积极策划新的阴谋，力图扩大老挝战火，使老挝内战国际化，进而威胁中国和越南民主共和国的和平和安全。
    越南民主共和国是印度支那的主要国家之一，同印度支那各国休戚相关。中华人民共和国是老挝的毗邻。中越两国都是日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的签字国，因此，中越两国人民对美帝国主义在老挝策划的这种危险活动，不能不表示严重的关切。美国国务院的声明中，扬言老挝只有二百万人口，不可能威胁中国与越南民主共和国的安全，这完全是一种诡辩。事情非常明白，中国、越南民主共和国与老挝人民之间存在着传统的友好关系，老挝本身绝不会威胁中国和越南民主共和国，正如中国和越南民主共和国不会构成对老挝的威胁一样。现在的问题是，美帝国主义对老挝进行干涉和控制，企图把老挝变成它的军事基地，这样就把美帝国主义的军事威胁直接带到了中国和越南民主共和国的边境。
    因此，正如我国外交部发言人在谈话中所指出，对目前老挝的严重局势，美国国务院和老挝培·萨纳尼空政府应该负完全责任。只有美国和萨纳尼空政府停止一切破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的措施，撤走在老挝的所有美国军事人员和军火武器，撤除所有美国军事基地，恢复国际委员会的正常监察监督活动，彻底实施日内瓦协议和万象协议，才能消除美国所一手造成的老挝紧张局势。其它途径是没有的。我国外交部发言人还指出，美国和萨纳尼空政府正在酝酿把老挝问题提交联合国，企图通过联合国的“干涉”来掩盖美国对老挝的侵略行为。维护日内瓦协议明显地是老挝停战双方和有关国家的共同义务，联合国根本无权干涉。所谓联合国的“干涉”本身就是对日内瓦协议的破坏和蔑视。这当然是不能容许的。
    中国人民密切注视着老挝局势的发展。中国人民一致支持老挝爱国战线党的正义主张和越南民主共和国的严正声明。我国外交部发言人在谈话中提醒美国政府和老挝当局，它们的一切违反日内瓦协议和在印度支那制造紧张局势并进而威胁中国安全的活动，都必然要遭到中国政府和人民的坚决反对，美国政府和老挝当局必须承担由于它们的这些活动而产生的一切后果。
