Homeland Airspace Defenders
——Visiting the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Jiang Qingzhao Su Tianzhong

On our way to the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron, we couldn't help but recall a United Press International news dispatch from July 30th of last year: "Yesterday, in a lopsided two-to-zero battle that left the Nationalists breathless over the Taiwan Strait, supersonic Communist MiG-17s shot down two Nationalist F-84 Thunderjet fighter planes." This aerial battle occurred on the morning of July 29th of last year, but it was not in the "Taiwan Strait" as UPI reported, but over Shantou and Nan'ao Island in our country; not only were two of the four U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes that came to intrude shot down, but another was damaged. This outstanding aerial battle was fought by the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron we are about to visit. The four tiger generals who participated in the battle were Zhao De'an, Huang Zhenhong, Gao Changji, and Zhang Yilin.

Stepping into the barracks of this flight squadron, we were immediately greeted by walls adorned with silk banners and rows of certificates of merit. Clearly, outstanding aerial battles like the one on July 29th of last year were not unique to this squadron. For several years, the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron has stood at the forefront of defending the homeland's airspace. It has grown stronger with each battle, having shot down or damaged twelve enemy aircraft without suffering any casualties; it has also set a record of more than seven years of safe flying, becoming the People's Air Force's "Air Combat Pacesetter."

We first visited Squadron Leader Zhao De'an. He is tall, sturdy, and of imposing stature. Eight years ago, when he was transferred to aviation school from the army, he only had an elementary school education, which caused many difficulties in his studies. At that time, the Party and his superiors encouraged him: "As long as you work hard, you will definitely be able to fly!" Zhao De'an listened to the Party's words, worked diligently, learning culture while practicing flying. After graduating from aviation school, Zhao De'an came to a field airport. During the day at the airport, he watched the pilots take off and land with thoughtful eyes; in the evenings, back in the dormitory, he painstakingly studied the aircraft instrument diagrams he had drawn and posted on his bedside, and used a wooden stick to simulate the aircraft control stick, practicing "rudder pedal" and "control column" movements while sitting on his bed. Even when riding in a car, he habitually practiced estimating the angle in front of the car. Every time he watched a movie, he would choose a seat in the back row of the balcony, taking advantage of the high vantage point to train his ranging ability. To make himself able to endure in the air, he practiced playing basketball and volleyball, practiced long-distance and short-distance running, practiced high jump and swimming...

"I must fly a jet fighter into the sky! The Party requires this of me, the people require this of me, and the task of defending the homeland's airspace also requires this of me!" Zhao De'an demonstrated unwavering perseverance in his training. It was during the sweltering summer, and the airport was as hot as fire. Whenever he had free time, he would sit in the aircraft, which was as hot as if it had been baked in a fire, to practice cockpit procedures. Finally, Zhao De'an tamed the "war eagle" like a knight taming a fiery steed.

On January 31, 1956, Zhao De'an and his then wingman, pilot Lü Shiming, cornered a U.S.-made F-86 Chiang Kai-shek aircraft intruding into our country's airspace, forcing it to land at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. The Chiang Kai-shek air force major pilot on the enemy plane, Li Shenglin, was so terrified that he broke a landing gear in his hasty landing and almost lost his life. This was the first victory of the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron in the southeast coast of our country. However, they were not satisfied and resolved to improve their skills even further. The pilots studied diligently and practiced hard day and night, launching a vigorous real combat training campaign. In flight practice, they often used a small cloud in the sky as a search target to practice shooting skills. Zhao De'an received the title of "Excellent Shooter" several times. On National Day in 1956, while the people of the whole country were immersed in the joy of the festival, the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron, guarding the southeast coast, damaged a U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft that came to harass, and since then they have created a glorious record of seven victories in seven battles.

Huang Zhenhong, one of the tiger generals of the Zhao De'an Fighter Squadron, is now Zhao De'an's wingman. People often use "love like brothers, close as limbs" to describe the relationship between pilots, especially between the lead pilot and the wingman. This metaphor is indeed apt. Zhao De'an and Huang Zhenhong became close comrades-in-arms early on. Huang Zhenhong is a high school graduate and is quick-witted. Whenever he has free time, he tutors Zhao De'an in his studies; Zhao De'an then explains tactics to Huang Zhenhong. The two are inseparable in peacetime, and even more like one person in battle. Huang Zhenhong's father participated in the "February 7th" strike and was brutally murdered by the Japanese army during the Anti-Japanese War. Whenever Huang Zhenhong and Zhao De'an talked about this, both of them were filled with anger. They once stood together beside a silver jet fighter, expressing their determination to the azure sky: "Now that the motherland has us, we will never allow imperialist aerial bandits to run rampant again!"

As mentioned above, in addition to Zhao De'an and Huang Zhenhong, Gao Changji and Zhang Yilin also participated in the "lopsided" air battle on July 29th of last year, as described by United Press International. They are also tiger generals of the Zhao De'an Squadron, and also an excellent pair of dual-aircraft. Lead pilot Gao Changji has rich experience in air combat, but he was once a small medic in the infantry, carrying a Red Cross medical kit and running through squads and platoons. He has a meticulous and gentle personality, and his love for airplanes has reached the point of "obsession." Although he flies and sits in airplanes all day long, he still feels it is not enough, and he always carries two small aluminum airplane models in his pocket, taking them out and playing with them whenever he has nothing to do. Wingman Zhang Yilin is an even more famous fierce tiger general. He left the old base area of Jiaodong Peninsula at the age of fourteen, put down the red-tasseled spear of the children's corps, and joined the People's Liberation Army. He first served in the infantry as the leader of a "shock squad" and demolition expert, fighting across the north and south of the Yangtze River, participating in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and receiving seven or eight citations for merit.

When we visited this pair of tiger generals, others told us this tense battle story: In an air battle on the Fujian front, Zhao De'an led a squadron from his own unit and a squadron from another unit, a total of eight aircraft, and encountered twelve U.S.-made F-86 Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. This was a "two-on-three" air battle—the enemy had the advantage in numbers, and at that time, our aircraft had not yet climbed to a sufficient altitude, and the enemy aircraft took the favorable position of being above and behind us. In this extremely unfavorable situation, the pilots heard Zhao De'an's order and immediately turned around sharply and plunged into the enemy formation. The vast sky immediately became a battlefield of interwoven teeth: our pair of dual-aircraft was "bitten" by enemy aircraft, and the enemy aircraft "biting" me were "bitten" by another pair of our dual-aircraft; there were enemy aircraft following behind, and the tails of those enemy aircraft had long fallen into the hands of our pair of dual-aircraft. Only white smoke trails streaked across the clear sky, and the sound of artillery fire was constantly transmitted from the sky to the ground.

At this time, eighth wingman pilot Zhang Yilin was tightly covering lead pilot Gao Changji to attack the enemy aircraft, but he did not expect that two enemy aircraft were approaching his tail from behind. At this time, lead pilot Gao Changji had already "bitten" an enemy aircraft in front, and only one more step was needed to shoot down that enemy aircraft. But he suddenly heard Zhao De'an calling his aircraft number, telling him to pay attention to vigilance, and he turned his head and saw that wingman Zhang Yilin had fallen within the effective range of enemy aircraft fire. At this critical moment, Gao Changji decisively abandoned the opportunity to shoot down the enemy aircraft with the push of a button, "Rescuing comrades is the priority!" He made a sharp turn and rushed head-on towards the enemy aircraft with his war eagle. When the enemy pilot saw someone coming head-on, he was so frightened that he turned and fled. The pilot on the other enemy aircraft also panicked, and opened fire randomly without accurate aiming. Gao Changji's wingman Zhang Yilin looked up and saw a string of tracer bullets flying over the top of his cockpit, and immediately realized that the enemy aircraft behind him was approaching him at high speed. He quickly thought of a solution, slammed on the brakes, and suddenly reduced his flight speed, while the enemy aircraft was caught off guard, "swishing" past Zhang Yilin's front. Zhang Yilin turned from a defensive position to an offensive position, accelerated and chased from behind, and suddenly pushed the button. The enemy aircraft was hit and exploded, the aircraft turned into a "roast chicken" and plunged into the sea.

At ten o'clock in the morning on July 29th of last year, the sky was cloudy and drizzling. Four U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft took advantage of this weather and quietly intruded into the airspace above Shantou and Nan'ao Island in our country. A squadron of four fighter planes from the Zhao De'an flight squadron, led personally by Zhao De'an, took off to meet the enemy. They broke the routine of cloud-top formation, formed a formation under the low clouds, and rushed straight towards the enemy. In that battle, Gao Changji and Zhang Yilin each shot down an enemy aircraft, and Zhao De'an damaged an enemy aircraft. After this cloud-based annihilation of the enemy, the heroic Zhao De'an Squadron was commended by the Ministry of National Defense. (Attached picture)

    祖国领空保卫者
    ——访赵德安歼击机大队
    新华社记者　姜庆肇  苏天中
    我们去赵德安歼击机大队的路上，不由地记起去年7月30日美国合众国际社发出的一条空战消息：“超音速的共产党米格十七型飞机昨天在台湾海峡上空进行的一次使国民党人透不过气来的一边倒的二比零战斗中，击落了两架国民党的F——八四雷电喷气机。”这场空战发生在去年7月29日上午，不过它不像合众国际社说的在“台湾海峡”，而是在我汕头和南澳岛上空；前来窜扰的四架美制蒋机，不但被击落了两架，还有一架被击伤。这场出色的空战，就是我们所要访问的赵德安歼击机大队打的。参加战斗的是赵德安大队的四员虎将——赵德安、黄振洪、高长吉和张以林。
    走进这个飞行大队的营房后，迎面就看到墙壁上悬挂着一面面锦旗，和一排排奖状。显然，像去年7月29日那场出色的空战，在这个大队里并不只一次。几年来，赵德安歼击机大队一直站在保卫祖国领空的最前列。它愈战愈强，先后击落击伤敌机十二架，自己一无伤亡；并且创造了七年多安全飞行纪录，成为人民空军的“空战标兵”。
    我们先访问了赵德安大队长。他长得高大、结实、身材魁伟。八年前，他刚从陆军部队调到航校的时候，只有高小文化程度，在学习上遇到不少困难。那时候党和上级鼓励他：“你只要下苦功，一定能够飞起来！”赵德安听信党的话，苦苦用功，边学文化边练飞行。赵德安从航校毕业后，来到了野战机场。白天在机场上，他闪烁着深思的目光，看飞行员怎样起飞和着陆；晚上回到宿舍，又对着自己画来贴在床头上的飞机仪表图煞费苦心，还用一根木棒代替飞机操纵杆，坐在床上练“蹬舵”和“拉杆”。甚至在乘汽车的时候，也习惯成自然地练习目测汽车前的角度。每次看电影，他都挑选楼上后排的座位，顺便利用一下居高临下的位置，锻炼他的目测力。他为使自己能够在空中持久，苦苦地练习打篮球排球，练长跑短跑，练跳高和游泳……。
      “我一定要驾驶着喷气式飞机飞上天空！党这样要求我，人民这样要求我，保卫祖国领空的任务也这样要求我！”赵德安在练习中表现了坚韧不拔的毅力。那是在酷热的夏季，机场上像火一样灼热。他一有空，就坐到像用火烤过一样烫人的飞机上去，进行舱座练习。最后，赵德安终于像一位骑士驯服了一匹烈性的骏马那样，驯服了“战鹰”。
    1956年1月31日，赵德安跟他当时的僚机飞行员吕世明，曾经把一架窜扰我国领空的美制F—八六型蒋机，打得走投无路，被迫落到香港启德机场。敌机上的蒋帮空军少校驾驶员李盛林吓得丧魂落魄，飞机降落时仓惶中摔坏起落架一根，险些连命搭上。这是赵德安歼击机大队在我国东南沿海打的第一个胜仗。但是，他们并不满足，决心更好地提高本领。飞行员们风雨无阻、夜以继日地勤学苦练，展开了热火朝天的实战练兵运动。在飞行练习中，他们常常把空中的一小块飞云，当作搜索的目标，练习射击技术。赵德安连续几次得到“优秀射手”的称号。在1956年国庆节的那天，当全国人民沉浸在节日欢乐中的时候，守卫在东南沿海的赵德安歼击机大队，击伤了前来骚扰的美制蒋机一架，从此以后他们创造了七战七捷的光辉战绩。
    赵德安歼击机大队的虎将之一黄振洪，现在是赵德安的僚机。人们常用“爱如兄弟、亲如手足”来比喻飞行员之间、特别是长机和僚机之间的关系，这个比喻真是再恰当不过了。赵德安和黄振洪两人，很早就成了亲密战友。黄振洪是个高中毕业生，人又机灵，一有空就为赵德安补习文化；赵德安便给黄振洪讲解战术。平时两个人形影不离，在战斗中更像一个人一样。黄振洪的父亲参加过“二七”大罢工，在抗日战争期间被日军惨杀。黄振洪和赵德安一谈到这件事，两个人都满肚子怒火。他们曾一起站在银色的喷气式战斗机旁，对着蔚蓝的天空表示决心：“今天祖国有了我们，决不让帝国主义空中强盗再来横行霸道！”
    上边已经提到，参加去年7月29日那场被美国合众国际社称为“一边倒”的空战的，除赵德安和黄振洪外，还有高长吉和张以林，他们两人也是赵德安大队的虎将，而且是大队里的一对优秀双机。长机高长吉在空战方面已有丰富的经验，可是他当年却是步兵部队的一个小卫生员，背着红十字药囊跑遍班、排。他的性格细致、温和，对飞机的热爱却达到了“迷”的程度，虽然整天开飞机、坐飞机还嫌不够，衣袋里还老是装着两只铝制的小飞机模型，一没事就掏出来摆弄着玩。僚机张以林，更是一员有名的猛虎将，从十四岁就离开了胶东半岛老根据地，放下儿童团的红缨枪，参加了人民解放军；先在步兵当
  “突击班”班长和爆破手，随军奋战过大江南北，参加过抗美援朝，荣立过七、八次战功。
    我们访问这一对虎将的时候，别人对我们讲了这样一段紧张的战斗故事：在福建前线的一次空战中，赵德安率领了自己大队的一个中队和别的大队的一个中队，共八架飞机跟十二架美制F—八六型蒋机遭遇了。这是“二对三”的一场空战——敌人在数量上占了优势，而且当时我方的飞机还没有上升到足够的高度，敌机先我一步占了我后上方的有利位置。在这种极端不利的情况下，飞行员们听到赵德安一声令下，立刻猛然反转身来插入敌阵。辽阔的天空立刻变成了一个犬牙交错的战场：我们的一对双机被敌机“咬”住，“咬”我的敌机又被我另对双机“咬”住；后面又有敌机跟踪，而那对敌机的尾巴早落在我一对双机手中。只见万里晴空划出白烟道道，炮声不时从天空传到地面。
    这时，八号僚机飞行员张以林，正紧紧地掩护着长机高长吉向敌机进攻，没料到有两架敌机从后面接近了他的机尾。这时候，长机高长吉已经把前面的一架敌机“咬”住，只要再靠近一步，就可以把那架敌机击落。可是他猛然听到赵德安呼着他的机号，让他注意警戒，他一回头看到了僚机张以林已落入敌机的炮火有效射程以内，在这千钧一发之际，高长吉果断地放弃了一按电钮就把敌机打落的战机，“援救战友要紧！”他一个急转弯，用自己的战鹰，向敌机迎头冲去。敌人的飞行员一见有人迎面撞来，吓得他转身就逃。另一架敌机上的飞行员也慌了手脚，来不及准确瞄准，就乱开了炮。高长吉的僚机张以林，抬头看见一串曳光弹从他座舱上空飞过，顿时发现后边敌机在大速度地向他逼近。他急中生智，猛然一煞车，突然减低了飞行速度，而敌机措手不及，“唰”地一声冲到张以林的前方去，张以林从被攻击的地位转为攻击的地位，加大速度从后面追上去，猛然一按电钮，敌机中弹爆炸，飞机变成了“烧鸡”，一头栽进了大海。
    去年7月29日上午十点钟，天上乌云密布，细雨纷纷。四架美制蒋机利用了这个天气，悄悄窜入了我汕头和南澳岛上空。赵德安飞行大队的一个中队四架歼击机，由赵德安亲自带领起飞迎敌。他们打破了云上编队的常规，在低云下编好队形，直冲向敌人。在那次战斗中，高长吉和张以林各击落敌机一架，赵德安击伤敌机一架。这次云中歼敌后，英雄的赵德安大队受到了国防部的嘉奖。（附图片）
