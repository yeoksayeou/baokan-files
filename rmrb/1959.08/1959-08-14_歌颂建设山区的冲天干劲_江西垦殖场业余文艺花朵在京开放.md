Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Jiangxi Province State-Run Comprehensive Reclamation Farm Amateur Art Troupe brought excellent programs from the Jiangxi Province State-Run Reclamation Farm Amateur Art Festival to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation and the Ministry of Culture. The performances included various forms such as music, dance, quyi, recitation, and small concerts.

The Jiangxi Comprehensive Reclamation Farm includes more than one hundred and ninety reclamation farms. This art troupe is composed of excellent actors from amateur art troupes of fifteen state-run reclamation farms. The actors are all transferred cadres, demobilized soldiers, and social youths who enthusiastically participate in the construction of the old revolutionary base areas in the mountains. Most of the programs performed are created by them based on their own life experiences. These programs enthusiastically sing praises of the tremendous changes in the mountainous areas and express their soaring enthusiasm and pride in building the mountainous areas. The chorus "The Mountain Area is Advancing," "Building a Power Station on Jinggang Mountain," "Song of the Breeders," the collective kuaiban "Song of the Great Leap Forward," and the collective recitation "Comrades, Hard Work!" are all deeply moving. The song and dance programs "Celebrating the Harvest," "Camellias Fragrant on Jiulian Mountain," and "The Dowry of the Bridge Girl" all have local Jiangxi folk characteristics.

The performance of the Jiangxi Province State-Run Comprehensive Reclamation Farm Amateur Art Troupe has received attention from the capital's literary and art circles.

On August 10th, the Ministry of Culture invited people from the capital's music and dance circles to observe and discuss the performances. Everyone praised the programs performed by the art troupe for combining reality with ideals. Through lively artistic performances, people were excitedly able to see the tremendous changes before and after the opening up of the mountainous areas of Jiangxi and the even brighter future. Everyone believes that this performance is also a pleasant surprise to see the leap in the level of mass amateur art performances, which encourages professional art workers to accelerate the improvement of their ideological level and artistic quality, and to use more full political enthusiasm and flexible and diverse art forms to reflect the rich and vivid real life.

The Jiangxi Province State-Run Comprehensive Reclamation Farm Amateur Art Troupe will soon go to the distant Great Northern Wilderness to pay a two-month visit to the comrades in the Heilongjiang and Jixi reclamation areas.

　　歌颂建设山区的冲天干劲
　　江西垦殖场业余文艺花朵在京开放
    新华社13日讯　江西省国营综合垦殖场业余文工团，带来了江西省国营垦殖场业余文艺会演中的精彩节目，到首都向农垦部和文化部作汇报演出。演出的节目有音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、朗诵、小演唱等多种形式。
    江西综合垦殖场包括一百九十多个垦殖场，这个文工团由十五个国营垦殖场业余文工团的优秀演员组成。演员们都是热情参加红色老根据地山区建设的下放干部、复员军人和社会青年，演出的节目绝大部分是他们根据自己的生活经历创作的。这些节目热情地歌颂着山区面貌的巨大变化、抒发着他们建设山区的冲天干劲和自豪心情。大合唱“山区在前进”、“井冈山上修电站”、“饲养员”之歌，集体快板“大跃进之歌”，集体朗诵“同志，辛苦啦！”等，都深深激动人心。歌舞节目“庆丰收”、“九连山上茶花香”、“大桥姑娘的嫁妆”等，都具有江西地方民间色彩。
    江西省国营综合垦殖场业余文工团的演出，受到首都文艺界的重视。
    8月10日文化部邀请首都音乐舞蹈界人士观摩座谈，大家赞扬文工团演出的节目，既结合现实又富有理想，通过生动活泼的艺术表演，使人们兴奋地看到江西山区开垦前后的巨大变化和未来的更加美好的前景。大家认为，这次演出，还使人惊喜地看到群众业余文艺表演水平的飞跃提高，激励专业艺术工作者更要加速提高思想水平和艺术质量，用更加饱满的政治热情和灵活多样的艺术形式，去反映丰富生动的现实生活。
    江西省国营综合垦殖场业余文工团不久将前往遥远的北大荒，向合江、密山垦区的同志们做为期二个月的访问演出。
