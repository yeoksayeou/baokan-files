　　Finding the Source

　　Fighting drought requires water, which means finding the source of water. Fighting drought also requires the spirit of "man can conquer nature," which means finding the source of strength and the source of drive. To find the source of water, one must traverse deep valleys, secluded forests, and vast wildernesses. Every drop of water must be poured onto the seedlings, and one must brave the scorching sun and heat to open canals, build dams, dig ponds, and sink wells... If you don't give us water, we will take it by force. This struggle between man and nature requires genuine power to reverse the situation. The source of this power, however, does not require climbing mountains or wading through rivers; it lies within the masses. However, it is not readily available. Springs and streams can be blocked by boulders. Only by clearing away the ashes can a raging fire be ignited. People's drive and strength are often hindered by certain things, preventing them from being fully unleashed. When the drought resistance in Yingshan County reached a critical juncture, a few people lost confidence. However, the Yingshan County Committee had a good way to find this source of strength. A great debate, both inside and outside the Party, from top to bottom, removed the boulders and cleared away the ashes. The people's drive and strength, like unimpeded springs and streams, surged forward, never drying up, like a flame that has come into contact with oxygen, its light and heat sufficient to overcome all difficulties and defeat the enemy. Once this drive was fully mobilized, those who had previously retreated now beat the drums of war against nature with earth-shattering sounds. Plans multiplied, materials were secured, and difficulties bowed down and yielded. If anyone still feels powerless in the face of nature, let them learn from Yingshan's methods and find the source of strength.

　　找源泉
    抗旱，要水，需要找水的源泉。抗旱，要有“人定胜天”的气概，需要找力量的源泉，干劲的源泉。找水源，要跑遍深水幽谷，原野密林。把点滴之水都浇到禾苗上，又得冒烈日酷暑，开渠筑坝，挖塘打井……。你不给水，我偏要水，人与天争，需要的是真正的回天之力。寻找这力量的源泉，却不必登山涉水，它就在群众之中。可是，也并非垂手可得。泉水和溪流会被乱石挡住去路。拨开灰烬，才能燃起熊熊烈焰。人们的干劲和力量也常常被某些东西障碍着，不能充分发挥。应山县抗旱进入紧要关头的时候，少数人却丧失了信心。可是，应山县委有好办法寻找这力量的源泉。党内党外、上上下下的一场大辩论，就搬开乱石，拨去灰烬，人们的干劲和力量就像畅通无阻的泉水溪流，汹涌澎湃，永不枯竭，就像接触到氧气的烈焰，它的光和热足以排除万难，战胜敌人。这干劲一经鼓足，原来打退堂鼓的，现在擂起了声震寰宇的向大自然进军的战鼓。计谋多了，物资有了，困难向人们低头让路。如果有谁在大自然面前还觉得回天无力，就请他们学习应山的办法，找出力量的源泉。
