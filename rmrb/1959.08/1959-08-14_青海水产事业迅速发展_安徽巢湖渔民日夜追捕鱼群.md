According to the Qinghai Daily, Qinghai Province's aquatic industry has achieved great success in the first half of the year. According to incomplete statistics, the province produced 2,250 tons of *Gymnodiptychus ptychocheilus* (湟鱼) in the first half of the year, an increase of 50% over the total production in 1958.

In late April this year, before the ice on Qinghai Lake had completely melted, fishermen began netting. The Qinghai Lake State-owned Fishery has also greatly expanded this year, with the number of fishing locations increasing from one to four.

This spring, a new freshwater breeding farm was built in the suburbs of Xining, and more than 5 million fish fry were airlifted from Hubei Province for trial breeding here. After more than a month of careful feeding, the fish fry are growing well.

The development of Qinghai Province's aquatic industry in the first half of the year not only met the needs of the people's lives but also provided many favorable conditions for the great development of the aquatic industry in the future.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Since the beginning of summer, Chaohu area fishermen in Anhui Province have caught more than 500,000 *jin* of fish by August 7th, an increase of onefold over the same period last year.

In order to allow the people of cities and industrial and mining areas to eat fresh fish in the summer, the fishermen of the Chaohu area broke the centuries-old conventions of "winter fishing, not summer fishing" and "men fishing, not women fishing." They braved the sweltering heat and chased adult fish on the lake day and night, achieving great results. At present, while continuing to fish, the fishermen are also allocating some manpower to repair nets and boats, actively preparing for the peak autumn and winter fishing season. They plan to increase the production of adult fish by two to threefold compared with the same period last year during this year's peak fishing season.

The Anhui Provincial Party Committee and the Hefei Municipal Party Committee attach great importance to Chaohu's fishery production. In order to achieve planned stocking and fishing, after communization last year, the Chaohu District People's Committee, spanning the four counties of Feidong, Feixi, Lujiang, and Chaoxian, was established to strengthen the management of Chaohu's fishery production. Each management area under the leadership of the Chaohu District People's Committee has established fishing brigades, adhering to year-round production. In the first half of the year, they caught a total of more than 1.5 million *jin* of fish, an increase of nearly ninefold over the same period last year, and dug 187 fish ponds along the lake, stocking more than 7 million various fish fry. In order to ensure that the fish fry are strong, have a high survival rate, and do not escape, each management area has also implemented a responsibility system for contracting ponds, managing, feeding, ensuring survival rates, and ensuring output, so that the survival rate of fish fry generally reaches more than 80%.

Chaohu Lake is one of the five largest freshwater lakes in China, located in central Anhui Province. The lake has a circumference of more than 360 *li*, a vast water surface, and abundant lakeshores, and is rich in silver fish, dried shrimps, lake crabs, and other aquatic resources. After liberation, in order to develop fishery production here, the relevant departments mobilized the masses along the lake to dig three typhoon shelters for fishing boats to moor; last year, three fish barriers were built at Yuxikou, Baishanhe, Zhaohe, and other river mouths leading to the Yangtze River, stocking more than 30 million fish fry. During the flood season of the Yangtze River, these fish barriers can allow natural fish fry to flow into the lake with the backflow of river water, and in the dry season, they can control the escape of inland fish.

### 青海水产事业迅速发展　安徽巢湖渔民日夜追捕鱼群

　　青海水产事业迅速发展
　　安徽巢湖渔民日夜追捕鱼群
    据青海日报报道　上半年，青海省水产事业获得很大成绩。据不完全统计，全省上半年生产湟鱼二千二百五十吨，比1958年全年生产量还增加了50％。
    今年4月下旬，青海湖冰冻尚未完全融化，渔民们就开网生产了。青海湖国营渔场今年也得到了很大扩展，捕捞点由原来的一处发展为四处。
    今年春季在西宁市郊新修淡水养繁场一处，由湖北省空运鱼苗五百余万尾在这里试养。经过一个多月的精心饲养，鱼苗成长良好。
    青海省上半年水产事业的发展，不仅供应了人民群众的生活需要，而且为今后水产事业的大发展，提供了许多有利条件。
    据新华社讯　安徽巢湖地区渔民入夏以来到8月7日止，已捕鱼五十多万斤，比去年同期增长一倍。
    巢湖区渔民为了让城市和工矿区人民夏季也能吃到鲜鱼，打破了千百年来“冬捕夏不捕”、“男捕女不捕”的常规，冒着酷暑，日夜在湖面上追捕成鱼，取得很大成绩。目前，渔民们在坚持捕捞的同时，还抽出一部分人力修补网具和船只，积极迎接秋冬旺季大捕捞。他们计划在今年大捕捞期内，把成鱼产量比去年同期提高两三倍。
    中共安徽省委和合肥市委对巢湖渔业生产十分重视。为了做到有计划地放养和捕捞，去年公社化以后，就成立了跨越肥东、肥西、庐江、巢县等四县的巢湖区人民委员会，加强巢湖渔业生产管理。巢湖区人民委员会领导下的各管理区都成立了捕捞大队，坚持常年生产。上半年，他们共捕鱼一百五十多万斤，比去年同期增长近九倍，并在沿湖挖鱼塘一百八十七口，放养了各种鱼苗七百多万尾。为了使鱼苗养得壮，成活率高，不外逃，各管理区还实行了包塘口、包管理、包饲养、包成活率、包产量的责任制，使鱼苗成活率普遍达到80％以上。
    巢湖是我国五大淡水湖之一，位于安徽省中部。环湖围长三百六十多里，水面辽阔，湖汉繁多，盛产银鱼、虾米、湖蟹等，水产资源极为丰富。解放后，为了发展这里的渔业生产，有关部门曾发动沿湖群众挖了三处供渔船停靠的避风塘；去年又在裕溪口、白山河、兆河等通往长江的河口，建造了三座拦鱼箔，放养鱼苗三千多万尾。这种拦鱼箔在长江汛期，可以使天然鱼苗随着江水倒灌流入湖内，枯水季节又可控制内鱼外逃。
