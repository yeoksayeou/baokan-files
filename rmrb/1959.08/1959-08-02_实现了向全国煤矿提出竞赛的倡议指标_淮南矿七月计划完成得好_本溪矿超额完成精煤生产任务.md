Xinhua News Agency, Huainan, 1st -- By combining strengthened leadership with a vigorous mass movement, the Huainan Coal Mine achieved the competitive initiative targets proposed to national coal mines in terms of output, efficiency, and cost in July. The mine overproduced its raw coal plan by 12,000 tons in July; overall labor efficiency reached 1.751 tons, an increase of more than 11% compared to the same period last year; the production cost per ton of coal was 6.8 yuan, a decrease of 22.6% compared to the same period last year. In terms of tunneling, the amount of coal obtained has increased to four or five months' worth.

At the beginning of July, after the Huainan Mining Bureau, together with the Jingxi and Fushun Mining Bureaus, proposed a competitive initiative to the national coal mine workers, they quickly mobilized the masses of workers to launch a new upsurge in production. First, from the bureau to the mines, a series of cadre meetings and general worker meetings were held to repeatedly explain the importance of increasing coal production, which improved the ideological understanding of cadres and workers. They responded to the production competition call issued by the Ministry of Coal Industry with practical actions. The workers of Datong, Xiejiaji, and Liyingzi mines under the bureau issued a competitive initiative to the workers of other mines in the bureau, guaranteeing to comprehensively over fulfill the production tasks for July and the third quarter, which rapidly unfolded the socialist labor competition between mines, teams, and individuals. During the competition, a new high tide of production appeared in various mines, and coal production rose sharply. For example, the average daily output of the bureau in early July was 35,200 tons, which increased to 36,700 tons in mid-July, and then reached 42,000 tons in late July. Through the competition, the output of working faces in various mines has also greatly improved. Six mines, including Bijia岗, Xinzhuangzi, Xiejiaji No. 1 Mine, and No. 2 Mine, have all reached the "ten-thousand-ton" mine target.

While vigorously carrying out the mass movement, the Huainan Coal Mine also took various measures to strengthen production leadership and management. Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Yao Ke, Deputy Governor of Anhui Province, have both come to the Huainan Coal Mine to provide guidance. Leading cadres of the Huainan Municipal Party Committee, the Mine Party Committee, and the Mining Bureau also went deep into the mines to promptly discover and solve various specific problems in production. The Huainan Mining Bureau also transferred a group of personnel to form seven groups, including safety inspection, small coal kilns, flood prevention and drainage, and labor wages, to work in the mines. In order to strengthen the leadership of the production front line, leading cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in various mines went deep into the coal mining faces to organize regular cycle operations, ensuring the normal progress of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 1st -- The Benxi Coal Mine, known for producing high-quality coking coal, has reached the level of a ten-thousand-ton mine for five consecutive months. In July, this coal mine over fulfilled the national plan by 8.6% in completing the refined coal production task. The ash content of raw coal was also lower than planned.

In the first half of the year, the mine's production was doing well. Entering July, all the mine's workers immediately took active actions to fight the first battle of the third quarter. From the mine's Party Secretary and Mine Director to the leading cadres at all levels of the coal mining team, they all personally led production at the front line, while further strengthening the leadership of night shift production. The workers also improved production technology and strived to increase output and quality. The workers of the nationally renowned Wang Hengcheng coal mining team were planned to mine 450 tons of raw coal per day, and their average daily coal mining volume reached 700 tons in the first twenty-nine days of July. The Wu Baohe coal mining team promoted advanced coal mining experience, and their daily coal mining volume exceeded the plan by 50%.

    实现了向全国煤矿提出竞赛的倡议指标
    淮南矿七月计划完成得好
    本溪矿超额完成精煤生产任务
    新华社淮南1日电　加强领导和大搞群众运动相结合，淮南煤矿7月份在产量、效率和成本方面，都实现了向全国煤矿提出竞赛的倡议指标。全矿7月份原煤比计划超产一万二千吨；全员效率达到一点七五一吨，比去年同期提高11％以上；每吨煤的生产成本是六点八元，比去年同期降低22.6％。在掘进方面，获得煤量已增长到四五个月。
    7月初，淮南矿务局同京西、抚顺等矿务局一道向全国煤矿职工提出竞赛倡议以后，就迅速发动职工群众掀起了一个新的生产高潮。首先，从局到矿都分别召开了一系列的干部会议和全体职工大会，反复说明增产煤炭的重要意义，提高了干部和职工的思想认识，他们纷纷以实际行动响应煤炭工业部提出的生产竞赛号召。这个局所属的大通、谢家集二矿和李郢孜二矿的职工，向全局其他矿职工发出了保证全面超额完成7月份和第三季度生产任务的竞赛倡议，使矿与矿、队与队、个人和个人的社会主义劳动竞赛迅速展开。竞赛中，各矿的生产出现了新的高潮，煤炭产量直线上升。如7月上旬全局平均日产量是三万五千二百吨，到中旬就提高到三万六千七百吨，下旬又达到了四万二千吨。通过竞赛，各矿单位工作面的产量也有了很大提高。毕家岗、新庄孜、谢家集一矿、二矿等六个矿，都达到了“万吨”矿的指标。
    在大搞群众运动的同时，淮南煤矿还采取各种措施加强生产的领导和管理。中共安徽省委书记处书记李任之和安徽省副省长姚克等，都曾经到淮南煤矿给予指导。中共淮南市委、矿委和矿务局的领导干部，也纷纷深入各矿，及时发现和解决生产中的各种具体问题。淮南矿务局还抽调了一批力量，成立了安全检查、小煤窑、防排水、劳动工资等七个小组，深入各矿工作。为了加强生产第一线的领导，各矿党、政、工、团的领导干部都深入采煤工作面，组织正规循环作业，保证了生产的正常进行。
    新华社本溪1日电　以出产优质炼焦煤著称的本溪煤矿，已经连续五个月达到万吨矿的水平。7月份，这个煤矿超过国家计划8.6％完成精煤生产任务。原煤的含灰分也比计划降低了。
    上半年，这个煤矿的生产搞得比较好，进入7月，全矿职工为打好第三季度的头一仗立即积极行动起来。从矿的党委书记、矿长到采煤队的各级领导干部，都亲临第一线领导生产，同时进一步加强了对夜班生产的领导。工人们也改进生产技术，努力提高产量、质量。全国闻名的王恒成采煤队工人，矿上计划他们日采原煤四百五十吨，7月头二十九天他们的平均日采煤量达到了七百吨。武宝合采煤队，推广了先进的采煤经验，日采煤量超过计划50％。
