    Short Song Against Drought
    Guo Zhen
    Old sky, old sky, you don't rain,
    We never counted on you anyway!
    Open the sluice gates and draw water to irrigate the land,
    The seedlings still emerge neatly and uniformly.
    If you want to flood, we'll fight the flood,
    If you want drought, we'll irrigate,
    You don't have many tricks up your sleeve,
    We know your temper.

    抗旱短歌
    郭震
    老天老天不下雨，
    原来就没指望你！
    开闸引水浇好地，
    禾苗照样出得齐。
    你要涝，咱抗涝，
    你要旱，咱就浇，
    你的把戏没几套，
    你的脾气咱知道。
