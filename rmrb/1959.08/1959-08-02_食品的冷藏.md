    Refrigeration of Food
    Gao Shiqi
    The issue of food refrigeration has long attracted the attention and importance of mankind. Ancient Greek historians have described in detail how ancient people used cold to overcome heat.
    Ice is the representative of cold. In mankind's battle to conquer heat, it has always been at the forefront.
    In China, during the Zhou Dynasty, there were already special institutions for managing ice. Later, people learned to use ice to regulate indoor temperatures and to make cold drinks and food. The use of ice gradually expanded.
    In the seventeenth century, Europeans stored blocks of ice from winter in cellars and sold them in the summer. This business was very good. At that time, people already knew that under the protection of ice, many foods could remain fresh and taste better.
    In modern times, automatic refrigeration machines were invented.
    What is an automatic refrigeration machine?
    As everyone knows, if you pour a little alcohol on your hand, it will dry quickly, and your skin will feel cool; in the hot summer, you will feel cool when you come out of the swimming pool; when the sun sets, splashing cold water in the yard will also reduce the heat. These examples all illustrate that the evaporation of liquids can produce cold air. Scientists have used this principle to create automatic refrigeration machines. This is the most effective weapon for refrigerating food.
    Currently, the most commonly used automatic refrigerator is the electric refrigerator, which has three components: an electric motor, a compressor, and an evaporator or cooling section. After the current is applied, the motor starts to work, compressing gases such as sulfur dioxide or ammonia into liquid, and then flowing it into the evaporator, allowing it to evaporate into gas. When the liquid evaporates, it absorbs the surrounding heat and produces a cooling effect. The gas produced returns to the compressor, where it is compressed into liquid again. This cycle continues until the motor is turned off. This is the simple structural principle of an electric refrigerator.
    With automatic refrigeration machines, food transportation and preservation can be greatly facilitated. Fresh fruits and vegetables can be transported from the distant south to the north, and from the most abundant producing areas to the most deficient areas, without being damaged. In this way, the vitamins and minerals needed by the human body can be fully supplied. Experience has shown that places with refrigeration equipment are much better than those without, in order to prevent malnutrition and other diseases.
    With automatic refrigeration machines, large-scale cold storage warehouses can also be built, so that many kinds of food can be preserved from the peak season to the off-season, so that their supply can be balanced, and the economic losses caused by food spoilage can be reduced.
    In food refrigeration, temperature and humidity should be strictly monitored and managed. According to scientists' tests, the most standard temperature for food refrigeration rooms is between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Above this temperature, bacteria begin to multiply, and the food cannot maintain its original freshness. However, not all foods can maintain freshness at the same temperature and humidity. For example, bananas can be preserved very well at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, while potatoes prefer a temperature between 36 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit. Milk and meat prefer a temperature between 35 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If there is too much moisture in the environment, most foods are easily damaged, so the cold storage room should be kept dry. However, if there is too little moisture, the food is easily dried out, especially vegetables. To avoid losing moisture from leafy vegetables, it is necessary to maintain 90% humidity at low temperatures.
    In addition to the multiplication of bacteria, other changes can also occur if our food is stored for a long time, such as chemical changes caused by the enzyme action of the food itself, or oxidation, which causes fats to become rancid. The occurrence of these chemical changes is determined by the ambient temperature. For every 18 degrees Fahrenheit increase in the ambient temperature, the food spoilage process will accelerate by a factor of two.
    In addition, to ensure air circulation in the refrigerator, the cooling section must be placed on the upper layer of the refrigerator, allowing hot air to rise and cold air to descend, so as to achieve rapid circulation and rapid cooling.
    In addition to electric refrigerators, there are also gas or kerosene refrigerators and dry ice (dry ice is solid carbon dioxide, which is made by compressing and cooling carbon dioxide. The temperature is only 110 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. It does not melt into a liquid, but evaporates directly from a solid state into a gaseous state), which are also excellent cooling experts, but will not be described in detail here.

    食品的冷藏 
    高士其
    食品的冷藏问题，很早就引起人类的注意和重视了。古希腊的历史学家，曾经详细地叙述过古代人民怎样用冷来克服热的故事。
    冰是冷的代表，在人类征服热的战斗中，它一直站在最前线。
    我国在周朝的时候，已经就设有专门管理冰的机构了。后来，人们学会了用冰来调节室内的气温和用冰来制造冷饮冷食。冰的用途逐渐扩大。
    在十七世纪的时候，欧洲人把冬天的冰块保存在地窖里，等到夏天拿它们来出售，这种营业，生意很好。当时人们已经知道，在冰的保护下，许多食品都能保持新鲜，而且味道也较好。
    到了近代，又有自动冷却机的发明。
    什么是自动冷却机呢？
    大家知道：如果把一点酒精倒在手上，很快地就干了，觉得皮肤上有一阵凉爽；在炎热的夏天，你从游泳池出来，就会觉得凉快；在夕阳西下的时候，把冷水泼在院子里，也会减除暑气，这些例子，都说明了液体的蒸发能产生冷气。科学家利用这个原理，制成了自动冷却机。这是冷藏食品最有效的武器。
    目前，最常用的自动冷却机，就是电气冰箱，它有三个组成部分：电动机、压缩机和蒸发器或冷却部分。通过电流以后，电动机开始动作，把二氧化硫或阿莫尼亚等气体，通过压缩机，压缩成液体，再流到蒸发器里，让它蒸发成气体，当液体蒸发的时候，就会吸收周围的热气，而产生冷却作用，所产生的气体重新又回到压缩机里，再被压缩成液体，这样循环不已，直到电动机被关上为止。这是电气冰箱的简单构造原理。
    有了自动冷却机之后，在食品的运输和保存上，就能得到许多便利，新鲜的水果和蔬菜，就可以从遥远的南方运来北方；从最富足的产地运到最欠缺的地区，而不至于损坏。这样，人体所需要的维生素和矿物质，就能得到充分的供应。经验证明，为了预防营养不足和其他的疾病，有冷藏设备的地方，比没有强的多。
    有了自动冷却机，还可以建造大规模的冷冻仓库，这样，许多种食品就可以从旺季保存到淡季，使它们的供应达到均衡，并且减少了由于食品的损坏所带来的经济损失。
    在食品冷藏中，应当受到严密注意和管理的，就是温度和湿度。据科学家测验的结果，食品冷藏室内，最标准的温度，是华氏40度到50度之间，超过了这个温度，细菌就开始繁殖，食品就不能维持原来的新鲜状况了。但是，不是所有的食品都能在同一温度和同一湿度内保持新鲜，例如香蕉能在华氏60度的气温里保存得很好；而土豆所最欢迎的温度，是在华氏36度到38度之间；牛奶和肉类所最欢迎的温度，是在华氏35度到40度之间。如果环境里水分过多，大多数食品都容易损坏，所以冷藏室要维持干燥，但是水分过少，食品又容易发干，特别是蔬菜，为了避免使叶菜失去水分，就需要在低温下仍保持90％的湿度。
    除了细菌的繁殖以外，我们的食品如果搁久了，还会发生其他的变化，如由于食品本身的酵素作用，而引起的化学变化；又如由于氧化作用，而使脂肪变得腐臭，这些化学变化的发生，是决定于环境的温度，环境的温度每升高华氏18度，食品的腐化过程就会加速一倍。
    此外，要使冷却机里的空气流通，就必须把冷却部分安置在冷却机的上层，让热气上升，冷气下降，这样才能达到迅速流通和迅速冷却的目的。
    除了电气冰箱以外，还有煤气或煤油冰箱和干冰（干冰就是固体的二氧化碳，它是由二氧化碳压缩和冷却而制成的，温度只有华氏零下110度，它不会融化成为液体，而是由固体状态直接挥发成气体状态）等，也都是出色的冷却能手，在这里不一一细述了。
