    Fully and Effectively Utilize Scrap Materials
    Currently, significant achievements have been made in developing the production of daily-use industrial products in various regions. To further improve market supply, the production of daily-use industrial products (including small commodities produced by handicrafts) needs to be further developed in the future.
    To produce more daily-use industrial products, it is necessary to solve the problem of supplying more raw materials. In this regard, the state has already allocated a batch of important raw materials such as steel, wood, and cotton yarn to industrial and handicraft production units in various regions. However, we should also see that daily-use industrial products are products with a wide variety of designs, colors and specifications. It requires a considerable amount of raw materials; and it requires raw materials of various specifications. One can imagine how the state can arrange such suitable materials for every city when allocating them! In the past, many production units of daily-use industrial products, due to the restrictions of raw material specifications, experienced phenomena such as using long materials for short purposes, using large materials for small purposes, and using thick materials for thin purposes, resulting in waste of materials. So, what is the best way to solve the problem of raw materials for daily-use industrial products?
    The source of raw materials for daily-use industrial products needs to be partially allocated by the state; however, the main thing should be to fully utilize the scrap materials from large factories. The so-called scrap materials are the leftover scraps that are not used during cutting in large factories. This material is generally good material. In terms of shape, it can be large or small, thick or thin, long or short, thick or thin, suitable for the diverse requirements of small commodities for raw material specifications. In terms of quantity, it is also considerable. According to statistics from eight large factories in Heilongjiang Province, more than 2,000 tons of scrap materials are cut off each month. This figure can basically meet the needs of daily-use industrial production in the entire province. Whether from the perspective of specifications and varieties or from the perspective of quantity, the scrap materials from large factories should become a major source of raw materials for the production of small commodities.
    In fact, there has always been a connection between large and small factories in the use of raw materials; small factories use the scrap materials from large factories, and small products use the leftover materials from large products. This is a cooperative relationship that has been formed for many years. In the past, many alley factories in large cities such as Shanghai have always relied on large factories for their livelihood. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the increasing production tasks of large factories and the substantial increase in the demand for raw materials, many enterprises have used the leftover scraps from their factories to remelt steel. In this way, the long-standing cooperative relationship was interrupted for a period. Obviously, this situation should be changed. Scrap materials, although needed by large factories, do not have a significant impact. If these scrap materials are not used for the production of daily-use industrial products and are taken to remelt steel, then the state will have to supply complete and good materials to small factories for the production of daily-use industrial products; and these scrap materials with continued use value become waste products. From any point of view, this is a waste.
    Fully utilizing scrap materials is a question of rationally using materials. This not only needs to be fully utilized during the period when our country's raw material industrial base is not yet strong; even if the raw material industry is greatly developed, this issue cannot be ignored. Because increasing production and practicing economy is the principle of building socialism, and making the best use of everything is an important measure to increase production and practice economy. To do this well, in addition to establishing a clear viewpoint of increasing production and practicing economy ideologically, it is also necessary to carry out necessary organizational work. After clarifying which large factories have what kind of scrap materials and which small factories often need what kind of raw materials, organized and led cooperative activities can be carried out, so that scrap materials can be fully and effectively utilized, and more and faster production of daily-use industrial products can be achieved.

### 充分有效地利用边角余料

    充分有效地利用边角余料
    目前，各地在发展日用工业品生产方面，已经取得了显著的成绩。为了进一步改善市场供应，日用工业品（包括手工业生产的小商品）的生产，今后还需要有更大的发展。
    要生产更多的日用工业品，就需要解决更多的原料和材料的供应问题。在这方面，国家已经调拨了一批钢材、木材、棉纱等重要原料，分配到各地工业和手工业生产单位。但是，我们也应当看到，日用工业品是一项花色品种繁多、规格复杂的产品，它既需要相当数量的原料和材料；更需要各种规格的原料和材料。可以设想，国家在分配材料的时候，哪里有可能给每个城市都安排得这样合适哩！过去，有许多日用工业品的生产单位，由于受原料规格的限制，曾经出现过长材短用，大材小用，厚材薄用等浪费材料的现象。那末，什么是解决日用工业品原料材料问题最好的办法呢？
    日用工业品的原料来源，由国家调拨一部分，这是需要的；但是主要应当是充分利用大厂的边角余料。所谓边角余料，就是大厂剪裁时剩下的用不上的零碎材料，这种材料一般地都是好材料，从形状上来分，有大有小、有厚有薄、有长有短、有粗有细，很适合小商品对原料规格多样化的要求。从数量上来看，也是很可观的。据黑龙江省八个大工厂的统计，每月剪裁下来的边角余料，就有两千多吨，这个数字，基本上可以满足全省日用工业品生产的需要。无论从规格品种或是从数量上看，大厂的边角余料应当成为生产小商品的大宗原料来源。
    其实，在原料材料的使用上，大厂和小厂之间，历来是有联系的；小厂利用大厂的边角余料，小产品利用大产品的下脚料，这是多少年来形成的一种协作关系。过去，上海等大城市，有许多弄堂工厂，一向就是依靠大厂过日子的。大跃进以来，由于大厂的生产任务日益繁重，原料材料的需要量大大增加，不少企业，将本厂的下脚余料，用来回炉炼钢。这样，历来的协作关系，就中断了一个时期。显然，这种情况是应当改变的。边角余料，对大厂来说，虽然需要，但作用并不大。如果这些边材余料不用于生产日用工业品，把它拿去回炉炼钢，那末国家就得把完整的好材料供应小厂生产日用工业品；而这些有继续使用价值的边材余料却成了废品。无论从哪一方面来看，都是一种浪费。
    充分利用边角余料，这是一个对物资进行合理使用的问题。这不仅在我国原料工业基础还不雄厚的时期，需要加以充分利用；即使原料工业大大发展了，也不能忽视这个问题。因为增产节约是建设社会主义的原则，而物尽其用，又是增产节约的一条重要措施。要做好这一点，除了在思想上树立明确的增产节约观点以外，还需要进行必要的组织工作。对于哪些大厂，经常有什么样的边角余料，哪些小厂经常需要什么样的原料，摸清楚了这些情况以后，进行有组织有领导的协作活动，就能把边角余料充分有效地利用起来，就能更多更快地增产日用工业品。
