A Trip to the Alum Capital
By our reporters Li Xinmin and Zheng Zhibiao

	Charming Scenery
	The car headed south from Wenzhou, in southern Zhejiang, crossed the Feiyun River and the Ao River, and climbed up the overlapping mountains. Outside the car window, there was a lush green sea of forest, and the ripe rice in the mountains emitted an enticing fragrance. Commune members were busy harvesting. Passing Huayang Town, the scenery outside the window changed. The high mountains and ridges were all black-grey rocks. Chimneys emitting thick black and white smoke appeared from time to time on both sides of the road. We had entered the famous Alum Capital region of our motherland.
	The car continued to move forward, and finally stopped in the center of the Alum Capital – Fanshan Town. This is a basin three hundred meters above sea level, surrounded by mountains seven hundred to one thousand meters above sea level. The basin and the mountainsides are covered with rows of factories and various buildings. Chimneys are as dense as forests, and alum smoke fills the entire sky. The western and southern mountainsides are full of large and small mines; streams of people constantly come and go from the mine entrances. The booming sound of blasting ore is constantly heard, and the sound of motors and wind drills can also be vaguely heard. Many iron cables, wooden rails, and railway tracks for transporting ore are erected in the mountains; large and small roads are woven like spider webs in the mining area and the basin, with cars and handcarts coming and going non-stop. A small stream runs through Fanshan Town, and the stream water has turned milky white. What a boiling and moving production scene this is!
	The many mountains stretching twenty li here are rich in alunite. Some mountains are entirely composed of alunite. The alunite reserves in the Alum Capital are not only the largest in the country, but are also often seen in foreign literature.

	The Story of Fanshan
	A story is circulating in Fanshan: Six hundred years ago, a couple with two children passed by here and accidentally used a few stones from the mountain to make a stove for cooking. Soon, when they passed by here for the second time, they found that the stones they had used to make the stove had turned into a pile of silvery-white fine sand, with small ice sugar-like beads glittering in the sand. They put the small beads in their mouths to taste, and the taste was sour and astringent; when put in water, the turbid water became clear.
	It is said that this was the earliest person in Fanshan to refine alum and use alum. This male owner, some say was called Wang Jingcheng, others say Qin Fu. Later generations respected him and called him "Grandpa Mingbao" or "Lord Kiln Owner", and even built a temple for him as a memorial.
	It is difficult to verify whether this story is true or false. However, from that time on, alum production began here. After the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the number of people coming here to mine and refine alum gradually increased, and the output continued to increase. By the time of the First World War, due to the rise of national industry and commerce, the number of alum kilns once increased to twenty-eight, with a daily output of 1,900 jin of alum, reaching the historical peak before liberation. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, mines and alum refining industries were occupied by mine owners, bureaucratic capital, and unscrupulous merchants, who competed and squeezed each other, and alum production deteriorated. By 1943, only twelve alum kilns remained, and by 1948, almost all alum kilns had stopped production.
	After liberation, alum production quickly recovered and developed. The production volume in 1952 greatly exceeded the historical peak level. Afterwards, it rose year after year. By 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, alum production had increased by more than one and a half times compared to 1952. This year's output will be even greater than last year.
	Now, the Pingyang Mingfan Mine United Company is leading production here, with more than 4,000 employees. Here, various new tools are replacing manual labor, and machines and electricity are beginning to be used in mining production. Mechanized alum refining production is also being tested.

	The Enthusiasm of Old Workers
	In the mining area of the Alum Capital, we often encountered an elderly hunchbacked worker. His name is Dong Xili. For most of his life before liberation, he spent his days in the mine carrying stones with one shoulder and a carrying pole. His back was hunched from carrying, and life was still extremely difficult. After liberation, Dong Xili was transferred to work in the Safety Technology Section. Every day, he is active in the mine. Decades of production practice have trained him with a pair of sharp eyes. After a mine is blasted, he can see whether it is safe with a sweep around. Now, he appears wherever there are technically complex blasting operations.
	During the few days in the Alum Capital, we met many old workers. Some had worked here for decades, and some had never left the mine or alum refining furnace since the days of their fathers and grandfathers. They are now very enthusiastic and their work and production are excellent.
	Arriving at the First Mining Area, near the mine at the top of the mountain, we met Zhu Daozhu, the acting captain of the work area. He was coming out of the cave, covered in mud. Two months ago, he was still the leader of a production team in the work area. This team overfulfilled its tasks every month and created a new record of more than 2,000 consecutive days without accidents. Now, he is serving as the acting captain of a work area, commanding more than 400 workers. Before we met him, we heard that he had 23 years of mining history. We thought he must be a very old person, but when we met him, we found that he was a strong, middle-aged man, only 33 years old this year. We said, "Were you participating in labor in the mine just now?" He smiled and said, "I have never left production for a day. If I don't work, I can't exert my energy!" Someone next to us told us: Old Zhu became an acting captain, but he still works with the workers all day long, taking the lead everywhere, and commanding production from participating in production, he is a good leader.
	Li Ruoshuo, the foreman of the Fourth Work Section of the Fourth Alum Refining Workshop, has fifteen years of alum refining experience. He speaks shyly, but his drilling spirit can drill through diamond. His home is very close to his work place, but he often rolls up his bedding and lives in the factory building, studying problems with the workers, pondering this and pondering that. From the entire production process of calcination, weathering, dissolution, to crystallization, they have a series of improvements. Just taking the use of coal as an example, others burn fifteen jin of alum ore with every jin of coal, while they can burn more than eighteen jin.

	Life is also Advancing
	Every evening, when we walked on the streets of Fanshan Town or along the road, we saw workers coming and going who had gotten off work, taken a bath, and changed their clothes.
	After night fell, the buildings and the area around Fanshan lit up with electric lights. The loudspeaker broadcasted music, and under the neon lights in front of the Workers' Cultural Palace, groups of people happily went in to watch movies.
	The changes in the lives of the workers in the Alum Capital are enormous. The situation in the past, when they were threatened by unemployment, hunger, and death at any time, is gone forever. A 1957 statistic from the newly built workshop shows: Among the 115 workers' households in the entire workshop, five of their family members starved to death before liberation, two froze to death, five were forced to commit suicide, thirty-one were homeless, fifty-nine lived by eating wild vegetables, twenty-six were forced to go to jail, and thirty were forced to become soldiers. After liberation, forty-five workers were elected or promoted to be cadres of the trade union, workshops, and work sections, fifty-six workers got married, and thirty-seven houses were newly built. They all live very happily.
	Here, a technical secondary school specializing in training technical personnel has been established. Secondary schools, primary schools, and spare-time cultural schools are also absorbing a large number of workers and their children to study. There is also a workers' health center with fairly complete equipment, small clubs, small stadiums, small bathhouses, and health stations distributed throughout the mining area. The workers' barbershop provides free haircuts for workers, and the service staff of the workers' cafeteria also rack their brains to enable workers to eat hot meals and tea at any time. The Alum Capital is advancing, and the lives of the workers in the Alum Capital are also advancing.

　　矾都纪行

    景色迷人
    汽车从浙江南部的温州市南下，渡过飞云江和敖江，爬上了重重叠叠的大山。车窗外郁郁葱葱一片林海，山间成熟的水稻发散着诱人的香味，公社社员们正在忙着收割。车过华阳镇，窗外景色有了改变，高山峻岭上都是黑灰色的岩石，公路两旁不时出现冒着黑色和白色浓烟的烟囱，我们已经进入祖国著名的矾都地区了。
    车子继续前进，最后在矾都的中心——矾山镇停下来。这里是拔海三百米的一片盆地，四周包围着拔海七百米到一千米的群山。盆地上和山腰上遍布着一排排的厂房和各种各样的建筑物。烟囱密得像树林，矾烟弥漫整个天空。西方和南方的山腰都是大大小小的矿洞；洞口不断地出没着人流。爆炸矿石的轰隆声不时传来，马达的响声和风钻的叫声也隐约可闻。山间架起了许多运送矿石的铁索、木轨和铁轨；大大小小的道路，像蜘蛛网一样织在矿区和盆地上，汽车和手推车来往不停。一条小溪横贯矾山镇，溪水变成了乳白色。这是一幅多么沸腾动人的生产图景！
    这里绵延二十里的许多大山，都蕴藏着丰富的明矾石。有些山全部是由明矾石组成。矾都的明矾石藏量，不仅国内居第一，在外国的文献上也是常可看到的。
    矾山的故事
    矾山流传着这样一个故事：六百年前，一对夫妻带着两个孩子，路过这里，偶然用山上几块石头作灶烧饭。不久，当他们第二次路过此地时，发现前次作灶烧饭的石头已经变成了一堆银白色的细砂，砂中闪烁着冰糖似的小珠子。他们把小珠子放在嘴里尝尝，味道酸涩；放进水里，混浊的水就澄清了。
    据说，这就是最早在矾山炼矾和使用明矾的人。这个男主人，有人说叫王景成，有人说叫秦福。后人尊敬他，称之为“明宝爷爷”或“窑主爷”，还曾经为他建庙作纪念。
    这故事是真是假，很难查考。不过从那时候起，这里就开始生产明矾了。经过宋元明清几个朝代，来这里开矿炼矾的人渐渐增多，产量也不断增加。到第一次世界大战时，由于民族工商业的抬头，矾窑一度增至二十八座，日产明矾一千九百斤，达到了解放前历史上的最高峰。但是，在国民党反动派统治下，矿山和炼矾业为矿主、官僚资本、奸商所霸占，互相竞争倾轧，明矾生产每况愈下。到1943年，矾窑只剩下十二座，到1948年，矾窑几乎全部停产。
    解放后，明矾生产迅速恢复和发展。1952年的生产量就大大超过了历史上的最高水平。以后连年上升，到大跃进的1958年，明矾产量又比1952年增加一倍半以上。今年的产量又要比去年增大。
    现在，领导这里生产的是平阳明矾厂矿联合公司，职工有四千多人。这里，各样的新式工具代替着手工劳动，机器和电力开始运用在采矿生产上。机械化的炼矾生产也正在试验。
    老工人的劲头
    在矾都的采矿区，我们经常碰到一位上了年纪的驼背老工人。他叫董希理，解放前的大半辈子就是一只肩膀一条扁担在矿洞里挑石头度过的。背给挑驼了，生活仍是极其艰难。解放后，董希理被调到安全技术科工作。每天，他活跃在矿洞里，几十年的生产实践，训练了他一对锐利的眼睛，矿洞经过爆破，他四周一扫，就可以看出是不是安全。现在，哪里搞技术比较复杂的爆破，他就出现在哪里。
    在矾都几天，我们碰到的老工人不少，有的在这里作了几十年，有的从他的父亲、祖父那辈就没有离开过矿洞或炼矾炉。他们现在干劲都很高，工作和生产都很出色。
    来到第一采矿区，在山顶附近的矿洞边，我们和工区代理队长朱道诸遇上了。他正从洞里出来，满身是泥。两个月前，他还是工区一个生产小组长，这小组月月超额完成任务，而且创造了连续二千多天不发生事故的新纪录。现在，他担任一个工区代理队长，指挥着四百多工人。在我们未见到他以前，听说他已有二十三年的开矿历史，心想他一定是个年纪很老的人了，可是见面一看，原来是个身强力壮的壮年人，今年才三十三岁。我们说：“你刚才是下矿参加劳动吗？”他笑笑说：“我本来一天也没有脱离过生产。不劳动，劲没法使呀！”旁边有人告诉我们：老朱作了代理队长，还是整天和工人一起劳动，处处带头，从参加生产中指挥生产，是个好领导。
    第四炼矾车间第四工段的工段长李若铄，有十五年炼矾经历了，说话羞答答的，可是他的钻劲可以钻开金钢石。他的家离工作地点很近，他却经常卷着铺盖卷儿住在厂房里，和工人一起研究问题，琢磨这，琢磨那，从锻烧、风化、溶解到结晶的整个生产过程，他们都有一系列的改进。就以用煤来说吧，人家每斤煤烧十五斤矾矿石，而他们能烧十八斤多。
    生活也在前进
    每天傍晚，当我们到矾山镇街上或沿着马路散步时，来来往往的都是下了班，洗过澡，换了衣服的工人。
    夜幕降临以后，各个建筑物和矾山四周亮起了电灯，广播器播送着音乐，工人文化宫门前的霓虹灯下，一群一群的人愉快地进去看电影。
    矾都工人生活的变化是巨大的，过去随时受到失业、饥饿、死亡威胁的情况是一去不复返了。新建车间有一个1957年统计的数字：全车间一百一十五户工人，他们的家属在解放前饿死的有五人，冻死的二人，被迫自杀的五人，无家可归的三十一人，吃野菜度日的五十九人，被迫坐牢的二十六人，被迫当兵的三十人。解放后，有四十五位工人当选或被提拔为工会、车间、工段的干部，有五十六个工人结了婚，新建了三十七间住房，他们都生活得很愉快。
    在这里，一所专门培养技术人材的技术中学已经建立起来。中学、小学、业余文化学校也吸收着大量工人和他们的子弟来学习。这里还有设备相当齐全的工人保健院，有分布整个矿区的小型俱乐部、小型体育场、小型浴室和保健站。工人理发室替工人免费理发，工人食堂的服务员也殷勤地为使工人能随时吃到热饭和茶水而开动脑筋。矾都在前进，矾都工人的生活也在前进。
