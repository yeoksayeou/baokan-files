Gallop Ahead, Chollima!
By Our Staff Reporter

There are many moving pictures at the "Chollima" Exhibition of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held in Beijing. These pictures vividly reflect the achievements of the Korean people in various aspects of construction after the armistice.

	Pyongyang Speed
A group of photos displayed at the entrance of the exhibition hall illustrates the background situation when Korea began to restore its national economy. Stepping into this area, people seem to be transported back to the years of war a few years ago. Look, there are ruins everywhere, and rubble everywhere. It is almost impossible to distinguish between cities and villages on Korean soil.

However, the Korean people were not pessimistic or disappointed because of this. Encouraged by the Workers' Party, they were full of passion and confidence in life. As soon as the war stopped, they immediately began to clear the ruins and rebuild their homes. From the pictures on display, people can see that all the cities in northern Korea have now been restored. Even Wonsan, the port city that suffered the most severe war damage, is hard to find traces of the war. In many places, not long ago, there were only rows of low earthen houses, but today, rows of five- and six-story buildings have sprung up. A group of photos reflects the changes in urban residents' housing over the years: during the war, people lived in cave dwellings; after the peace, they moved into some low and simple temporary residences; now, they have moved into newly built buildings. A small family is moving. The father is carrying a large suitcase, the mother is carrying a bamboo basket, and a four- or five-year-old child is dragging his little wooden horse. Both adults and children are very happy. This is the general situation of the changes in the lives of working people in Korean cities.

During the war, the enemy dumped countless tons of steel on Pyongyang, bombing streets and houses into a mess. They vainly attempted to erase Pyongyang from the map. However, this heroic city, known as the "immortal bird," stood up stubbornly again, and it is more imposing and magnificent than in the past. On Stalin Avenue in the city center, neat buildings stand on both sides, and the street garden is a patch of green, appearing both majestic and beautiful. In East Pyongyang, which had become a wilderness during the war, people spent only six months building a modern Youth Street. The central square in West Pyongyang was renovated by the students of Kim Il-sung University, and the citizens of Pyongyang named it Mao Zedong Square. The university students also spent sixty days building a scenic road along the Datong River. A youth park has also been newly built under Moranbong Hill. Every day after dusk, groups of Korean girls wearing colorful dresses frolic under the picturesque Moranbong Hill and along the Datong River, as if living in a fairy tale world.

Now, the citizens of Pyongyang are continuing to build at an ever-accelerating pace. In 1956, it took 105 days to build 1,000 square meters of housing in Pyongyang. In 1958, it only took 14 days. Recently, due to the use of prefabricated building components, a set of working people's housing can be assembled every sixteen minutes. This is the "Pyongyang speed" that the Korean people are proud of.

	The Hearts of the Workers
If one only sees these changes from the outside, one cannot fully understand the achievements of Korea's post-war construction. In recent years, the development of Korea's national economy has had much deeper content than this.

Now, Korea already has its own strong metal industry base. Through the photos on display, one can see the magnificent scale of more than a dozen reconstructed or newly built modern metallurgical factories and mines. Among them, a group of photos is particularly eye-catching. This is a depiction of the Hwanghae Iron Works being rebuilt from a pile of scrap iron. During the war, the US imperialists dropped more than 18,000 bombs on the Hwanghae Iron Works. The invaders asserted that the factory's chimney would never smoke again. However, as soon as the war stopped, the Korean working class immediately filled in more than 900 bomb craters in the factory, and in less than a year, they repaired the No. 1 blast furnace, which was officially put into production on April 30 last year.

The reconstruction process of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Hwanghae Iron Works demonstrated the creativity and spirit of overcoming difficulties of the Korean working class. Originally, this blast furnace had been 85% destroyed and had to be dismantled and repaired. When dismantling it, the large pieces of molten rock inside the furnace had to be broken open. This was a very hard substance formed by the condensation of coking coal, slag, and molten iron. It could not be opened with a chisel, and blasting was feared to damage the furnace body. What to do? Labor hero Ren Changhao did not know how many nights he stayed by the furnace before he came up with a solution: chisel out a gap as wide as two firebricks around the furnace body, set up two 100-ton heavy-duty machine plates, pry open a large crack, and then use a 30-ton heavy hammer to smash it open.

Labor hero Kim Ki-mo, when talking about the situation when they repaired the blower, could not suppress his inner excitement. He said: "The factory's steam turbine blower pipe was blown up by the enemy. Some old workers and I advocated repairing the old blower. However, some people opposed the repair and advocated buying an electric motor blower pipe from abroad. Before the higher authorities made a final decision, Premier Kim Il-sung came to the factory to inspect and held a cadre meeting in the manager's office. Premier Comrade asked: 'Can the blower be repaired?' At this time, my heart almost jumped out. After Premier Comrade left, without waiting for the leadership to notify us, we began to collect the blower parts that had become waste products. Later, the leadership decided to repair the old blower. In the snowy and freezing nights, we worked hard in the blower pipes that could only be crawled into, with our frozen hands. On the day of the trial run in March last year, the sound from the blower was exactly the sound we had heard familiarly eight years ago. I was so happy that tears flowed out."

In order to speed up the progress of the project and save manpower and material resources for the country, the workers of the Hwanghae Iron Works solved one problem after another with an active creative spirit. Ren Changhao's rationalization proposals alone saved more than 9,500 man-days and a large amount of building materials. Old worker Yuan Daozhong created a large iron plate bending machine, which not only made the furnace shell faster but also saved more than 8,500 man-days. They worked tirelessly and forgot to eat and sleep to realize their guarantee to the Party: to put this blast furnace into production before the "May Day" holiday in 1958.

This mood of the workers of the Hwanghae Iron Works represents the feelings of the entire Korean working class. Many of the pictures exhibited at the "Chollima" exhibition provide very obvious examples. It was this mood that enabled the workers of the Kim Chaek Iron Works to repair a blast furnace that was expected to take one year and four months to repair in three months; enabled the zinc smelting workshop of the Wenping Smelting Plant to be completed three years ahead of schedule; and enabled the workers of the Jiangxian Steel Plant to achieve the first creation of electric iron smelting in Korea in January this year.

	Machine Tools Produce Machine Tools
At the exhibition, one can also see many photos of modern machinery factories and their new products, which reminds one of an event in the autumn of 1958. At that time, a trade delegation from a capitalist country visited the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Pyongyang. The guide told them: "This SU50 lathe was manufactured by the Heechun Machine Tool Plant." A guest couldn't help but blurt out, "Really?" Such surprise is by no means accidental. Because, before liberation, Korea could not even make earth plows, and it was severely damaged during the war. It is certainly not easy for people from the capitalist world to understand that it can produce such a large machine with international standards. If that guest comes to Korea again today, he will be even more surprised. In this year, Korea's machinery industry has made great progress again. Last year, Korean workers successfully trial-produced hundreds of new products. Among the many photos of new products exhibited at this exhibition, there is the first tractor successfully trial-produced by Qiyang Machinery Factory in November 1958, and the first bulldozer successfully trial-produced by Beizhong Machinery Factory in December of the same year. In addition, there are trucks, electric locomotives, 4,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators, universal milling machines, etc. Currently, all these new products have been put into large-scale production. Modern industrial and mining enterprises such as the No. 2 blast furnace of the Kim Chaek Iron Works and the Musan Concentrating Plant are also equipped with machines produced in Korea. Today, Korea already has its own strong machinery industry, which can basically solve the various mechanical equipment needed by various sectors of the national economy. Now, Korea is also carrying out a comprehensive mass movement, requiring each existing machine tool in each factory to produce more than one machine tool. This "machine tool production machine tool" movement in the machinery manufacturing industry is of great significance to comprehensively accelerate Korea's socialist construction.

The pictures exhibited this time also show that Korea's electrical industry, chemical industry, coal industry, food industry, daily necessities industry, as well as agriculture, culture, and education have also developed rapidly. In the rural areas of northern Korea, the task of agricultural socialist transformation has been completed. At present, Korea has implemented compulsory secondary education, and now about one-quarter of the people in the north are studying in schools at all levels.

Through the pictures on display, people can also see many interesting things: the Xingnan Fertilizer Plant is using water and air as raw materials to manufacture a highly effective nitrogen fertilizer, and engineer Li Chengji of the Qingshui Chemical Plant has successfully researched and used calcium carbide to manufacture the chemical fiber Binalon. The experiment of Qingjin Spinning Mill using rice straw and corn stalks as raw materials for spinning and weaving has also been successful.

	Thousand-Li Divine Steed
A beautiful legend is circulating in Korea: In ancient times, there was a military general who experienced various twists and turns in his childhood and tasted the bitterness of the world. Later, he met a "Taoist" and learned his skills, and also obtained a divine horse with wings that could fly over high mountains and ridges, cross rivers and seas, and travel thousands of miles a day. Therefore, the military general rode this Chollima all over the world, pacifying the troubled times, and enjoyed high prestige among the people. This is an illusion produced by ancient people's yearning for a happy society, containing the urgent desire of the people to realize their wishes quickly. However, due to the limitations of historical conditions at that time, people could only place their ideals on the legend of Chollima. Now, the times are completely different. The heroic and hardworking Korean people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and with the assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, have the opportunity to quickly realize their ideals. Therefore, today in North Korea, we have seen an era of inspiring leaps like the legends.

The fantasies of the predecessors have become today's reality.

　　飞奔吧，千里马！
　　本报记者
    在北京举行的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“千里马”展览会上，有许多动人的图片。这些图片生动地反映出停战后朝鲜人民各方面的建设成就。
            平壤速度
    陈列在展览室入门处的一组照片，说明朝鲜开始恢复国民经济时的背景情况。一走到这儿，人们仿佛又被带回到几年前战争的年月里。你看，到处是颓垣断壁，到处是一片瓦砾场，在朝鲜的国土上几乎分不清那里是城市，那里是乡村。
    但是，朝鲜人民并没有因此悲观失望。他们在劳动党的鼓舞下，对生活充满着豪情和信心。战争一停止，他们就立即动手清理废墟，重建家园。从展出的图片上人们可以看到，朝鲜北部所有的城市现在都已经恢复建设起来了。连遭受战争破坏最严重的港口城市元山，也很难找到战争的创伤了。许多地方，不久以前还是一片低矮的小土房，今天都已耸立起一排排五、六层的楼房。有一组照片，反映出几年来城市居民住宅变迁的情况：战时，人们住在窑洞里；和平后，搬进一些低矮简陋的临时住宅；现在，搬上新建的楼房。有一个小家庭正在搬家，爸爸扛着一口大箱子，妈妈手里提着竹篮，一个四、五岁的孩子拖着他的小木马，大人小孩都非常高兴。这正是朝鲜一般城市劳动人民生活变化的情景。
    在战争期间，敌人曾经向平壤市倾倒了无数吨钢铁，把街道、房屋炸得稀烂。他们妄想把平壤从地图上取消。但是，这个被称为“不死之鸟”的英雄城市，又顽强地站立起来了，而且比过去更加有气魄，更加壮丽。在市中心马路斯大林大街，两边耸立着整齐的楼房，街心花园一片翠绿，显得又雄伟又美观。在战时变成荒野的东平壤，人们只花了六个月时间就建成了一条现代化的青年大街。西平壤的中心广场，被金日成大学的学生们打扮得焕然一新，平壤市民把它命名为毛泽东广场。大学生们还用六十天的时间，在大同江边修建了一条游览马路。牡丹峰下也新建了一个青年公园。每天黄昏以后，一群群穿着五色缤纷裙衣的朝鲜姑娘，在风景如画的牡丹峰下，在大同江畔嬉游，简直是生活在童话世界里。
    现在，平壤市民还在继续用不断加快的速度进行建设。1956年，平壤建设一千平方米的住宅，要一百零五天才能完成。1958年只要十四天。最近，由于采用预制构件的建筑方法，每十六分钟就能装配好一套劳动人民的住宅。这是朝鲜人民引以自豪的“平壤速度”。
              工人的心
    如果光从外表上看到这些变化，还远不能了解朝鲜战后建设的成就。几年来，朝鲜国民经济的发展，还有比这深刻得多的内容。
    现在，朝鲜已经拥有自己强有力的金属工业基地。通过展出的图片，可以看到十几个重建或新建的现代化冶金工厂和矿山的雄伟规模。其中，有一组照片特别引人注意。这是黄海制铁所从废铁堆中重建起来的写照。在战争时期，美帝国主义向黄海制铁所投下了一万八千多颗炸弹。侵略者曾断言，这个厂的烟囱再也冒不出烟来了。但是，战争一停止，朝鲜的工人阶级立即填平了厂里的九百多个弹坑，并且在不到一年的时间里，就修复了第一号高炉，去年4月30日正式投入生产。
    黄海制铁所第一号高炉的重建过程，表现了朝鲜工人阶级的创造性和克服困难的精神。原来这个高炉已经被破坏了85％，必须把它拆卸，进行整理。在拆卸的时候，要砸开炉里的大块熔岩。这是一种由焦煤、炉渣和铁水凝结成的很坚硬的东西，用凿子打不开，要爆破又怕炸坏炉体。怎么办呢？劳动英雄任昌浩同志在炉旁不知熬了多少夜晚，才想出一个办法：在炉体周围凿出两块耐火砖那么宽的缝，架上两台一百吨抗重机板，扳开一道大裂缝，然后用三十吨重的大铁锤砸，这才把它砸开了。
    劳动英雄金琦模一和人谈起当时他们修理送风机的情况，就按不住内心激动的情绪。他说：“厂里的蒸气透平送风管被敌人炸坏了，我和一些老工人同志主张修复旧送风机。但是，有人反对修理，主张从外国买进电动机送风管。上级还没有作最后决定，刚好金日成首相来工厂视察，在经理办公室里召开干部会议。首相同志问：‘能不能修复送风机？’这时我的心差一点就跳出来了。首相同志走后，不等领导上通知，我们就开始搜集已经变成废品的送风机零件。后来，领导上决定要修复旧送风机了。在风雪凛烈的深夜，我们呵着冻僵的手，在仅仅能够爬进去的送风管里坚持工作。去年3月开始试车的那天，从送风机传来的声音，正是八年前听得耳熟的声音，我高兴得眼泪都流出来了。”
    为了加快工程的进度，为国家节省人力物力，黄海制铁所的工人以积极的创造精神，解决了一个问题又一个问题。单是任昌浩同志所提出的合理化建议，就节约了九千五百多个人工和大量建筑材料。老工人元道仲创造了一架大型铁板弯曲机，不仅使炉壳制造得更快，还节约了八千五百多个人工。他们就是这样用尽心血，废寝忘餐地劳动，来实现他们向党提出的保证：在1958年“五一”节以前使这座高炉投入生产。
    黄海制铁所工人的这种心情，代表了朝鲜全体工人阶级的情感。“千里马”展览会所展出的许多图片提供了非常明显的例证。就是这种心情，使金策制铁所的工人，用三个月时间修复了一个预计要一年零四个月才能修复的高炉；使文坪冶炼厂的炼锌车间提前三年建成；使降仙炼钢厂的工人，今年1月间实现在朝鲜第一次用电气炼铁的创举……。
          机床生产机床
    在展览会上，还可以看到许多现代化机械厂和它们的新产品的照片，这使人想起1958年秋天的一件事情。那时，有一个资本主义国家的贸易代表团在平壤参观工农业展览馆。讲解员告诉他们：“这台SU50型旋床是熙川工作母机厂制造的。”一个客人竟忍不住脱口问：“真的吗？”这样惊讶绝不是偶然的事情。因为，解放前朝鲜连土铧犁都做不好，战时又遭到严重的破坏，竟能造出这样具有国际水平的大机器，来自资本主义世界的人当然是不容易理解的。如果那个客人今天再到朝鲜，他一定会更加惊讶。在这一年中，朝鲜的机械工业又有了很大的发展。去年，朝鲜工人试制成功了几百种新产品。这次展览会所展出的许多新产品照片中，就有歧阳机器厂1958年11月试制成功的第一部拖拉机，北中机械厂同年12月试制成功的第一架推土机。此外，还有载重汽车、电气机车、四千瓩水力发电机、万能铣床……等。目前，所有这些新产品都已经进行大规模生产。像金策制铁所第二号高炉和茂山选矿场那样的现代化工矿企业，也是用朝鲜自己生产的机器装备起来的。今天，朝鲜已经有了自己强有力的机械工业，能够基本上解决本国国民经济各部门所需要的各种机械设备了。现在，朝鲜还正在开展一个全面性的群众运动，要求各工厂现有的每一台工作母机都制造出一台以上的工作母机。机械制造业的这种“机床生产机床”运动，对全面加速朝鲜的社会主义建设具有重要意义。
    这次展出的图片还表明，朝鲜的电气工业、化学工业、煤炭工业、食品工业、日用品工业以及农业和文教事业，也都发展得很快。在朝鲜北部的农村中，农业社会主义改造任务已经完成。目前朝鲜已经实行了中学义务教育，现在北部有四分之一左右的人在各级学校里念书。
    通过展出的图片，人们还可以看见许多有趣的事情：兴南肥料厂正在利用水和空气作原料，制造一种肥效很高的氮氨肥，青水化学厂的工程师李承基研究用电石制造化学纤维比奈隆成功了。清津纺线厂用稻草和玉米秸作原料纺线织布的试验也成功了。
            千里神马
    朝鲜民间流传着一个美丽的传说：古代有一位武将，幼时经历过种种波折，尝尽了人世间的辛酸，后来遇到“道人”学了本领，还得到一匹有翅膀的神马，能够飞越高山峻岭，跨过大江、大海，日行千里。于是，武将就骑着这匹千里马，走遍天下，平定乱世，在人民中享有很高的威信。这是古代人们向往幸福社会所产生的幻想，包含着人民希望很快实现自己的愿望的迫切心情。但是，那时由于历史条件的限制，人们只能把理想寄托于千里马的传说。现在，时代已经完全不同了，英勇勤劳的朝鲜人民，在劳动党的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的援助下，就有可能很快地实现自己的理想。因此，今天在朝鲜北方，我们看到了像传说中那样振奋人心的飞跃的时代。
    前人的幻想已经变成今天的现实。
