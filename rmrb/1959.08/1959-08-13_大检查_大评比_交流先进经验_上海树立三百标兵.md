Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 12th: Shanghai's various industrial sectors recently organized a mass-based grand inspection and appraisal of the inter-factory competitions of the previous period. As of now, within the industrial systems of machinery, electrical machinery, chemical industry, textiles, light industry, etc., a total of 313 advanced units have been appraised by industry, and more than 780 units have received commendations and rewards. Through this inspection and appraisal, each industry has established models, summarized and exchanged a large number of experiences, and set off a wave of enthusiasm for comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced, pushing the city's socialist labor competition movement to a new peak.

Since the beginning of the year, in addition to launching a large-scale socialist labor competition, Shanghai's industrial departments have also organized competitions within each industry, by type of work, and by district; and have also launched city-wide, cross-industry, cross-regional competitions to conserve the four major materials of coal, coke, electricity, and petroleum. In order to ensure that this competition movement develops vigorously and steadily, each industry began in June to conduct inspections and appraisals of the first half of the year's competition. The cotton textile industry formed 22 inspection teams composed of more than 1,000 factory leaders, technicians, managers, and production workers to conduct zonal inspections and appraisals. The foundry industry formed 39 "counterpart" appraisal groups among enterprises with the same product type, equipment, and production scale to inspect each other. Before each factory inspected each other, they first mobilized the masses to conduct self-inspections and create new achievements to welcome mutual inspection; during mutual inspection, they inspected and reformed simultaneously, and summarized and exchanged experiences; after the appraisal, they immediately organized a new upsurge of learning from and catching up with the advanced, thus making the inspection and appraisal work an effective measure to promote the deepening of competition and promote production development.

The primary achievement of this grand inspection and appraisal was the excavation and promotion of a large number of advanced experiences in various industries. According to preliminary statistics, the cotton textile industry alone discovered more than 180 important experiences, including experiences in production technology, management, mass work, and living welfare. The exchange and promotion of these experiences has powerfully promoted the production of the entire industry. In July, although the city's production tasks of cotton yarn and cotton cloth increased by 10% to 12% compared to June, they still overfulfilled the plan. The casting workshop of Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory implemented three disclosures (the technical team discloses the technology to the preparation team, the preparation team discloses to the production team together with the technical team after the preparation work is completed, and the production team leader discloses to the workers), three guidances (full-time technicians go deep into the site for guidance, the production team leader guides the workers, and technically good workers guide the technically poor workers), and three inspections (quality inspection implements self-inspection, mutual inspection, and spot checks by full-time personnel), and five controls (technology control, preparation control, operation control, material control, and inspection control). As a result, in the first half of the year, not only was the output high, but the casting qualification rate also reached 99.35%, so it was rated as an advanced unit in the city's steel casting industry. Now the experience of this workshop has been promoted in steel casting factories and steel casting workshops throughout the city and the country. The steel casting workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 launched a mass movement to "learn mining (factory) management and catch up with mining (factory) quality," and after organizing more than 100 people to study at the Mining Machinery Factory, the scrap rate significantly decreased.

Through inspection and appraisal, the models of various industries have been established, and they have become the objects of everyone's pursuit. In the competition movement of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, the production of various industries has been powerfully promoted. At the beginning of July, after the enamel industry launched a competition to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced, the level of the entire industry has been generally improved, and the gap between the advanced and the backward has been shortened. In July, the highest first-class product rate reached 98.99%, and the lowest was also above 81%. The factories that were rated as advanced models in various industries have also taken new measures to take it to the next level. Since being rated as an advanced factory in the textile industry at the beginning of July, Anda No. 1 Factory immediately proposed new goals of accelerating vehicle speed and reducing end breakage rate, further mobilizing the masses to engage in technological innovation and technological revolution. In July, the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the entire factory overfulfilled the plan, and the product quality also gradually increased.

The grand inspection and appraisal not only stimulated mutual pursuit among factories, but also further promoted the communist spirit of cooperation among factories. In order to improve together, many factories, while inspecting others, both "learned" and "contributed," treating the difficulties of other factories as their own. Many inspection team members in the cotton textile industry not only worked with the employees of the inspected factories to study how to increase product output and quality, but even inspected and repaired machinery together with the maintenance workers of the inspected factories. Ke Yi Hardware Factory is a small brother in the steel casting industry. The equipment in the factory was just installed not long ago, and the technical level and management level were relatively poor. In the first half of the year, the scrap rate reached 13.3%. When Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory, Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory, and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, which had a better foundation, came to this factory for inspection, they put forward many suggestions for strengthening management and improving equipment. Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory found that this factory did not have a slag bag and took the initiative to make two slag bags for them; Machine Repair General Factory and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 saw that they did not have molding technicians and also agreed to draw some technicians and exchange them with their ordinary workers. Under the help and promotion of the older brothers, the employees of Ke Yi Hardware Factory also worked hard to improve quality, and the scrap rate in July quickly dropped to 7%.

Shanghai's experience proves that inspection and appraisal is a very effective method for organizing competition and promoting production. As early as March and April this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee jointly issued a notice deciding to organize three concentrated inspections and appraisals during the year to welcome "May Day," "July 1st," and National Day, so that the city's competition movement would rise one wave higher than the next. At present, the city's workers and masses are advancing victoriously, setting off a new wave of production to welcome the grand appraisal during the National Day.

　　大检查　大评比　交流先进经验
　　上海树立三百标兵
    新华社上海12日电　上海各个工业部门最近对前一个时期厂际竞赛组织了一次群众性的大检查大评比。到目前为止，机械、电机、化工、纺织、轻工业等工业系统中，按行业评比出的先进单位共有三百十三个，还有七百八十多个单位，受到了表扬和奖励。通过这次检查评比，各行业都树立了标兵，总结和交流了大批经验，掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮，把全市社会主义劳动竞赛运动推向新的高峰。
    年初以来，上海市除展开了声势浩大的社会主义劳动竞赛以外，各工业部门除了按行业按工种按区组织竞赛以外；还在全市范围内跨行业跨地区展开节约煤、焦、电力和石油四大物资的竞赛。为了使这个竞赛运动既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实地向前发展，各行业从6月份开始分别对上半年的竞赛作了检查评比。棉纺织行业由各厂领导干部、技术人员、管理人员和生产工人一千多人组成二十二个检查组，分区检查评比。铸造行业在产品类型相同、设备和生产规模相仿的企业中组成三十九个“对口”评比小组互相检查。各工厂互相检查以前，都先发动群众自查和创造新的成绩迎接互查；互查时，边查边改，边总结、交流经验；评比以后，又立即组织学先进、赶先进的新竞赛高潮，从而使检查评比工作，成为促进竞赛深入、推动生产发展的有效措施。
    发掘和发扬了各行业中大批的先进经验，是这次大检查大评比的首要收获。据初步统计，全市仅棉纺织行业发掘出的重要经验即有一百八十多项，其中包括生产技术、管理工作、群众工作、生活福利等各方面的经验。这些经验交流推广以后，有力地推动了全行业的生产。7月份，虽然全市棉纱和棉布的生产任务比6月份增加10％到12％，仍然超额完成了计划。上海矿山机器厂铸工车间推行了三交底（技术组把工艺向准备组交底、准备组在准备工作完毕后会同技术组向生产小组交底、生产组长向工人交底），三指导（专职技术人员深入现场指导、生产组长指导工人、技术好的工人指导技术差的工人），三检查（质量检查上实行自检、互检和专职人员抽检），把五关（工艺关、准备关、操作关、材料关、检查关）等办法后，上半年不仅产量高，铸件合格率也达到了99.35％，因此被评为全市铸钢行业的先进单位。现在这个车间的经验已经在全市、全国的铸钢厂和铸钢车间推广。上钢三厂铸钢车间开展了“学矿山
  （厂）管理，赶矿山（厂）质量”的群众运动，并先后组织了一百多人去矿山机器厂学习后，使废品率显著地下降了。
    通过检查评比，各行业的标兵树立起来了，它们成为大家追赶的对象，在学先进、赶先进你追我赶的竞赛运动中，有力地推动了各行业的生产。7月初搪瓷行业掀起了学先进赶先进的竞赛后，全行业的水平普遍提高了，先进和落后的差距缩短了。7月份，最高的一等品率达到98.99％，最低的也在81％以上。各个行业被评比为先进标兵的工厂也纷纷采取新的措施，再上一层楼。安达一厂自7月初被评比为纺织行业的先进厂以后，马上提出了加快车速，降低断头率的新的奋斗目标，进一步发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，7月份，全厂棉纱和棉布的产量都超额完成了计划，产品质量也逐步上升。
    大检查大评比不但激发了各工厂互相追赶，也进一步发扬了各厂的共产主义协作精神。为了共同提高，许多工厂在检查别人时，既“取经”又“献宝”，把别厂的困难当作自己的困难。棉纺织行业许多检查组的人员，不仅与被检查工厂的职工一起研究提高产品产量、质量，甚至与被检查工厂的保全工人一起检查和修理机械。科仪五金厂是铸钢行业的小兄弟，厂里设备刚安装起来不久，技术水平和管理水平都比较差。上半年废品率达到13.3％。上海矿山机械厂、上海机修总厂、上钢三厂等基础较好的厂到这个厂来检查时，就提出了不少加强管理、改进设备等方面的建议，上海矿山机器厂发现这个厂没有渣包，主动提出替他们做两只渣包；机修总厂和上钢三厂看到他们没有造型技工，也答应抽出一些技工和他们的普通工对换。科仪五金厂的职工在老大哥们帮助和推动下，也努力提高质量，7月份废品率迅速下降到7％。
    上海的经验证明：检查评比，是组织竞赛、促进生产的一个十分有效的方法。早在今年3、4月间，中共上海市委和上海市人民委员会就联合发出通知，决定在年内集中组织迎“五一”、迎“七一”和迎国庆的三次检查评比，使全市竞赛运动一浪高过一浪。目前，全市职工群众正乘胜前进，掀起了新的生产高潮，迎接国庆节时的一次大评比。
