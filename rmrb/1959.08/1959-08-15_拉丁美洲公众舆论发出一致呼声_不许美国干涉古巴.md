Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 13th: The people and public opinion of Latin America strongly oppose the United States' interference in Cuba through the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas.

According to a report by the Latin American News Agency today, Colombian university students held a demonstration in the capital, Bogotá, today. The demonstrators shouted slogans expressing support for Cuba and condemning the United States' conspiracy to interfere in Cuba and the Trujillo dictatorship.

Argentine university students held a symbolic strike in the capital, Buenos Aires, to oppose the United States' conspiracy to interfere in Cuba and the Dominican dictatorship. The National Executive Committee of the Argentine Journalists Association demanded that the foreign ministers attending the Meeting of Foreign Ministers publicly state their opposition to all dictatorships in the Americas.

Middle school students in the Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro held a thirty-minute symbolic strike today in protest against the United States' tools – the existing dictatorships in Latin America. The president of the National Union of Students of Brazil called on Latin American and Brazilian students studying in the capital to unite and fight against the Trujillo regime, the U.S. lackey in the Caribbean, for its aggression against Cuba.

Benedito Cerqueira, president of the Metallurgical Workers Union of the Federal District of Brazil, issued a statement on the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, saying that Brazilian metallurgical workers support Cuba's proposal at the meeting for a broad discussion of economic underdevelopment and support Cuba's just measures such as land reform.

The leader of the "Movement for the Independence of Puerto Rico," Santaella Blanco, sent a telegram to Raúl Roa, the Cuban representative attending the Meeting of Foreign Ministers, supporting Cuba's position of "living a dignified life without foreign interference." He said, "The cancer that corrodes the entire viscera of our America can be easily found," and that cancer is "in Washington."

News from Buenos Aires today said that the Argentine House of Representatives passed a proposal put forward by Leon, a member of the House of Representatives of the People's Radical Civic Union, on the evening of the 12th. This proposal requires the Argentine delegation attending the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas to adhere to the principle of non-interference.

Venezuelan labor and peasant leaders told reporters from the "National Daily" that they support the working people of Cuba. Luis Tovar, president of the Oil Workers Union, said that Venezuelan oil workers stand entirely on the side of the Cuban revolution and are vigilant against conspiracies to interfere in Cuba.
