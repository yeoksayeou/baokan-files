Xinhua News Agency, August 14th, Bangkok Dispatch: The United States is using Thailand to train Lao police personnel. According to a Bangkok newspaper report on the 10th, ten Lao police officers were recently sent to Thailand under the "assistance" of the United States International Cooperation Administration to receive training in "police communications technology" at the Thai Police Department Communications Bureau.

Prior to this, the Lao government sent seven telecommunications staff members in June to receive one month of training at the "Radar Detection Training School" in Bangkok. This school serves the aggressive policies of the United States, which intends to establish a "modern telecommunications network" in Southeast Asia.

According to newspaper reports, the Thai government recently accepted the recommendation of the US "foreign aid agency" and dispatched a group of personnel to Laos at the end of June to cooperate with the US "foreign aid agency" to "help" Laos "survey coal mines."

    新华社14日讯　曼谷消息：美国正在利用泰国训练老挝警察人员。据曼谷报纸10日报道，十名老挝警察最近在美国国际合作署“援助”下被派到泰国去，在泰国警察厅通讯局接受有关“警察通讯技术”的训练。
    在这以前，老挝政府曾在6月派遣七名电讯工作人员，在曼谷的“雷达探测训练学校”接受为期一个月的训练。这所学校是为美国的侵略政策服务的，美国打算在东南亚设立一个“现代化电讯网”。
    另据报纸报道，泰国政府最近接受美国“援外机构”的建议，在6月底派遣了一批人员前往老挝，同美国的“援外机构”合作，“帮助”老挝“勘测煤矿”。
