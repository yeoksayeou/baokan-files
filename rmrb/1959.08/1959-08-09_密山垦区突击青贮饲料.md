Mishan Reclamation Area Rushes to Silage Green Feed

(By our report) Some farms in the Mishan Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang have successively started this year's silage green feed work. The Third Branch Farm of the 856 Farm here started the first phase of silage work in mid-July. Their slogan is: Work hard for ten days and nights to silage 1,000 tons of feed. On July 14th, the mechanical personnel of the Third Branch Farm dispatched 170 people, ten horse-drawn carts, and two chaff cutters. They ensiled 59 tons of feed into the cellar in one day, and they achieved: fast operation, fine chopping, and suitable moisture content. In order to do a good job in this year's silage work, the Third Branch Farm of the 853 Farm organized a wild feed silage team of 52 people as early as the end of June.
