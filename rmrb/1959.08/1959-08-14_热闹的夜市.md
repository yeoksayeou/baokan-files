　　Lively Night Market

　　Stars hang in the azure sky, and the electric lights in front of the Jinzhou Town Cultural Center in Lüda shine silver. Rows of white tents stand on both sides. People throng to the night market.

　　The snack stalls are truly packed. In the stalls of the department store and Xinhua Bookstore, people are buying vests, towels, fans, books, and magazines... The salespersons are all happy and amiable, serving customers.

　　A crowd of people surrounds a stall at the west end of the road. Someone is heard calling out, "Comrade, please turn this collar for me." Another says, "Comrade, please carve a seal for me, I need it for tomorrow." Then someone shouts, "My glasses are broken, please repair them." Soon after, an old woman's voice is heard saying, "Please fix this lock for me. You must be so tired, still working here at almost nine o'clock!" Indeed, it is the tireless labor of the commercial personnel that brings much convenience to the residents.

　　热闹的夜市
    繁星挂在蔚蓝色的天空，旅大金州镇文化馆门前的电灯，银光闪闪。一个个的白色帐棚，林立两边。逛夜市的人川流不息。
    经济小吃的摊亭里真是座无虚席。百货公司、新华书店的摊亭里，有人在买背心、买毛巾、买扇子、买书刊……。售货员个个愉快和蔼地招待着顾客。
    大路西头的一个摊亭外围着一群人。只听有人喊道：“同志，给我翻翻这个衣领。”又有人说：“同志，请给我刻个印章，明天等着用。”随后又有人喊道：“我的眼镜摔坏了，请你给修理一下。”不一会儿又听到一位老太太的声音说：“给我修理修理这把锁。你们可太辛苦了，都快九点钟了，还在这儿工作！”是的，正是商业人员不辞辛苦的劳动，为居民们带来了许多的方便。
