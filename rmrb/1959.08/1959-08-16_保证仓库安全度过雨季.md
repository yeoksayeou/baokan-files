　　Ensure Warehouse Safety During the Rainy Season

　　Ensuring that warehouse goods are not damaged is the duty of warehouse workers in the commercial system. During the rainy season, this responsibility becomes even greater. This year, many areas have experienced heavy rainfall, which has brought certain difficulties to the storage work of warehouse workers. However, as long as the warehouse Party committee strengthens leadership and fully mobilizes the masses, pooling their wisdom and efforts, difficulties can be overcome, and every warehouse can safely weather the rainy season. The warehouse workers of the Beijing Commercial System have set an example by overcoming the attacks of gales and torrential rains with tenacious struggle in recent days, safeguarding the safety of state property.

　　At present, the threat of heavy rain in many areas has not subsided. Warehouse workers in various regions must advance victoriously, continue to stand firm in their posts, dredge ditches and dams, repair cargo sheds and stacking, and block all loopholes that floods may invade, so that commodities will not be damaged and can safely weather the rainy season.

    保证仓库安全度过雨季
    保障仓库商品不受损失，是商业系统仓库职工的职责。在雨季里，这个责任就更加重大。今年，许多地区的降雨量很大，给仓库职工的保管工作带来了一定的困难。但是，只要仓库党委加强领导和充分发动群众，群策群力，困难是可以战胜的，各个仓库是能够安全度过雨季的。北京市商业系统仓库职工，连日来用顽强的斗争，战胜了狂风暴雨的袭击，保卫了国家财产的安全，就是一个榜样。
    目前，许多地区的暴雨威胁仍未减退，各仓库职工要乘胜前进，继续坚守岗位，疏通水沟、水坝，整修货棚码垛，堵塞洪水可能侵袭的一切漏洞，使商品不受损失，安全度过雨季。
