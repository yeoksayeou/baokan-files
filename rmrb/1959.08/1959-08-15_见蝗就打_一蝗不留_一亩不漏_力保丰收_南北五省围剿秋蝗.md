Xinhua News Agency, 14th: In the areas of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces where autumn locusts have appeared, vigorous efforts are underway to encircle and suppress locust nymphs. To date, these five provinces have treated over 60% of the area affected by autumn locusts. Currently, the battle to eliminate locusts in the affected areas continues intensely, with the broad masses determined to completely eradicate the autumn locusts and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture as of now, the area affected by autumn locusts in the five provinces of Henan, etc., totals over 15 million mu, with Henan and Shandong provinces accounting for more than two-thirds. According to the situation in early August, the density of locust nymphs was relatively high in the Jining Special District of Shandong, the Yellow River滩地(Tan Di-riverside land) of Henan, the Xuzhou Special District of Jiangsu, and the Huai River area of Anhui. Generally, there are ten to twenty insects per square zhang, with individual severely affected areas reaching over ten thousand. Currently, the locust nymphs are at an advanced stage, and some have already turned into adult locusts and begun to harm crops. In Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces, over 110,000 mu of late autumn crops have already had their leaves eaten by locusts.

In order to eliminate the locust plague in a timely manner, the people in the locust-affected areas of Henan, etc., launched an intense battle to encircle and suppress autumn locusts as soon as the plague occurred. Currently, over 800,000 people are mobilized daily to kill locusts in the locust-affected areas of Henan Province. In Yanling County, Xuchang Special District, under the slogan "The whole party mobilizes, the whole people take action, strike locusts on sight, leave none behind," over 52,000 people have joined the locust eradication battle. In Ningling County, Kaifeng Special District, cadres and the masses are full of energy, catching and killing locusts during the day and using gasoline lamps to lure insects at night. The vast majority of areas affected by autumn locusts have already been treated. Now, the autumn locusts in Kaifeng and Xuchang Special Districts are nearing elimination, while other areas are still in the midst of intense fighting. In the Jining and Heze Special Districts of Shandong Province, where the locust plague is more severe, 300,000 people participate in locust control every day, treating over 1.3 million mu of land infested with locust nymphs in three days. The autumn locust control team in Changyi County, under the slogan "Leave no acre unsearched, leave no locust behind," launched a fierce attack, treating all 110,000 mu of farmland infested with locusts.

In the locust eradication battle, the masses in various locust-affected areas, in addition to using methods such as spraying pesticides, spreading pesticides, and catching and killing locusts, have also created some good methods that save labor, save money, and are highly effective. In the Jining Special District of Shandong Province, green grass is chopped up, mixed with 666 pesticide powder, and sprinkled on the ground where locusts appear. The locusts die immediately after eating it. This "green grass poisoned bait" method of killing insects has a kill rate of 95%. In Ershilipu, Jining County, this poisoned bait was used to eliminate locust nymphs on more than 60,000 mu of land in one and a half days. Some places in Shandong and Henan are promoting the use of this method, which utilizes local materials and has good results.

The occurrence of autumn locusts in the five provinces of Henan, etc., has received the attention of relevant departments at the central and local levels. After the locust plague occurred, the leading departments at all levels in the locust-affected areas promptly formed locust eradication command headquarters. In Ningling County, Henan Province, the secretary of the County Party Committee took command and convened two meetings of the commune Party committee secretaries to study and organize locust eradication work. As a result, before August 6th, the main force of locust nymphs in an area of 110,000 mu was basically eliminated. Grasping the pattern of locusts concentrating on laying eggs near lakes, depressions, and paddy fields, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry made strict arrangements to prevent locusts from spreading. For example, Sihong County organized each locust control brigade to set up reconnaissance outposts and fixed scouts, responsible for inspecting and observing within a specified time, to prevent residual locusts from escaping. In this campaign to annihilate autumn locusts, the central government also dispatched special locust eradication aircraft to the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, which powerfully supported and encouraged the locust eradication work in various locust-affected areas.

### 见蝗就打　一蝗不留　一亩不漏　力保丰收　南北五省围剿秋蝗

　　见蝗就打　一蝗不留　一亩不漏　力保丰收
　　南北五省围剿秋蝗
    新华社14日讯河南、河北、山东、江苏、安徽五省发生秋蝗的地区，正在大力围剿蝗蝻。到目前止，这五个省防治面积已达秋蝗发生面积的60％以上。现在，蝗区的灭蝗战斗正在继续紧张进行，广大群众决心彻底消灭秋蝗，力争秋季丰收。
    据农业部截至目前的不完全统计，河南等五省秋蝗发生面积共有一千五百多万亩，其中，河南、山东两省占三分之二多。据8月初的情况，山东济宁专区、河南黄河滩地、江苏徐州专区和安徽沿淮一带的蝗蝻密度较大，一般的每平方丈有虫十到二十头，个别严重地块达万头以上。目前蝗蝻龄期大，一部分蝗蝻已经变为成虫，开始危害庄稼。河南、山东、江苏三省，共有十一万多亩晚秋作物已被蝗虫咬了叶子。
    为了及时地消灭蝗害，河南等蝗区人民在蝗情一发生时，就投入了紧张的围剿秋蝗大战。现在河南省蝗区，每天出动八十多万人灭蝗。许昌专区鄢陵县，在“全党动员，全民动手，见蝗就打，一个不留”的口号下，有五万二千多人，投入灭蝗战斗；开封专区宁陵县，干部群众干劲十足，白天人人捕打，晚上用汽油灯诱虫，绝大部分发生秋蝗的面积已经进行了防治。现在开封、许昌两专区的秋蝗已接近消灭，其它地区还在鏖战中。山东省蝗情较重的济宁、菏泽两专区，每天有三十万人参加治蝗，三天就防治了一百三十多万亩地上的蝗蝻。昌邑县防治秋蝗的队伍，在“一亩不漏，一蝗不留”的口号下，猛攻猛打，对十一万亩有蝗虫的农田，全部进行了防治。
    各蝗区的群众，在灭蝗战斗中，除了用喷药、撒药、捕打等办法防治外，还创造了一些省工、省钱、效大的好办法。山东省济宁专区把青草切碎，拌上六六六药粉，撒在发生蝗虫的地面上，蝗虫一吃，即被毒死。这种“青草毒饵”灭虫法，杀虫率达95％。济宁县二十里铺使用这种毒饵，一天半时间就消灭了六万多亩面积上的蝗蝻。山东、河南有些地方，正在提倡使用这个就地取材，效果良好的办法。
    这次河南等五省发生秋蝗，得到了中央和地方各级有关部门的重视。蝗情发生后，蝗区各级领导部门及时组成了灭蝗指挥部，河南省宁陵县由中共县委书记挂帅，召开两次公社党委书记会议研究和组织关于灭蝗工作，因此，在8月6日前，就基本消灭了十一万亩面积的蝗蝻主力。江苏省农林厅抓住飞蝗向湖边、洼地、稻田内集中产卵的规律，对防止飞蝗流窜，做了严密的部署，如泗洪县组织各治蝗大队设立了侦察了望哨、固定侦察员，在规定时间内负责检查、了望，不让残蝗漏网。在这次歼灭秋蝗中，中央还向山东、河南、江苏、安徽四省派出了专门灭蝗的飞机，有力地支援和鼓舞了各蝗区的灭蝗工作。（附图片）
