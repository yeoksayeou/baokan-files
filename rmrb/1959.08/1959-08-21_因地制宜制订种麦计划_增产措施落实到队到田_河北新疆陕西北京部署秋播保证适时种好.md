    Formulate Wheat Planting Plans According to Local Conditions; Implement Increased Production Measures Down to Teams and Fields
    Hebei, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, and Beijing Deploy Autumn Planting to Ensure Timely and Successful Sowing

    According to Xinhua News Agency reports: People's Communes in Hebei are summarizing their experience in achieving high wheat yields this year and are starting early to prepare for autumn wheat sowing.

    This year, Hebei Province achieved a universal bumper harvest of wheat. Recently, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Science and Technology Association, and other organizations jointly convened a technical discussion meeting on increasing wheat production. At the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee called for fully utilizing this year's experience in increasing wheat production to ensure that autumn wheat is sown and managed well, achieving an even greater wheat harvest next year. The Provincial Party Committee also proposed that measures related to the sowing plan, contracted output, labor, investment, fertilizer, seeds, tools, and pesticides must be swiftly implemented in each production team.

    In the process of implementing these measures, the People's Communes and production teams in Hebei Province have been boosting morale, striving for excellence, and becoming increasingly motivated. Generally, preparations for wheat planting are starting earlier and being pursued more vigorously than in previous years, and concrete plans for increasing production have also been made. According to statistics as of August 3rd, the province has prepared 50 billion catties of fertilizer for wheat fields, accounting for 30% of the fertilizer needed for wheat planting. In terms of water conservancy construction, while comprehensively inspecting existing water sources and irrigation machinery, efforts are also being made to dig wells, open canals, and store water to expand the irrigated area. The irrigated area of wheat fields in the province can reach 70% of the total wheat fields. To achieve rational close planting, all communes and teams have prepared sufficient seeds, generally reserving 20 to 25 catties of seeds per mu.

    To ensure successful sowing, all localities have emphasized the selection of soil quality and crop rotation. 90% of the province's wheat can be planted in wheat stubble land and early-maturing crops such as millet and corn harvested before the White Dew solar term. The area of early-maturing wheat is about 30% more than last year, while late-maturing wheat accounts for only 10%. Because of the good crop rotation selected this year, timely sowing can be guaranteed. Many counties and communes are also carrying out tool reform movements, inspecting, repairing, and adding deep plowing and sowing tools. Wheat stubble land is being plowed in summer to expose the soil to the sun, conserve water, and preserve moisture.

    To achieve overall increased production, all localities have adopted a leadership method of grasping both high-yield and low-yield areas, and using high-yield fields to lead general fields while carrying out sowing preparations.

    Vigorously developing high-yield fields is a valuable experience gained from this summer's bumper harvest. The province plans to universally develop large areas of high-yield fields with yields of over 400 catties per mu in 1960.

    Urumqi, August 20th (Our Newspaper) - With the winter wheat sowing season approaching in both the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, People's Communes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are intensifying summer plowing and vigorously accumulating fertilizer, striving to sow winter wheat well and meticulously. According to statistics from the autonomous region's agricultural department, the winter wheat sowing area this year will expand by approximately 2 million mu compared to 1958.

    The Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Committee grasped the preparations for expanding the winter wheat area before the summer harvest this year. According to the principle of "more planting, more harvesting," they instructed all prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and counties to fully utilize favorable conditions and discuss and arrange winter wheat sowing plans early. After discussions, all localities universally proposed plans to expand the winter wheat area. The autonomous region comprehensively studied and arranged the plans reported by various localities based on local natural conditions, labor force, and population growth along the railway lines, and then issued the plan for the entire region's winter wheat sowing area. Currently, this plan has been implemented in the People's Communes.

    To ensure a bumper wheat harvest next year, the autonomous region's leading departments convened on-site meetings for winter wheat planting preparation work in both southern and northern Xinjiang. The meetings also summarized this year's experience in achieving high wheat yields. After the meetings, various counties and People's Communes successively convened symposiums on high-yield experience and formulated technical measures for sowing winter wheat according to local conditions. Currently, nearly one-third of the winter wheat good seeds have been selected throughout the region while harvesting and threshing. As the summer harvest approaches its end, People's Communes in various localities immediately organized plowing professional teams, seizing the opportunity of summer heat to plow winter wheat land, striving to plow most of the winter wheat land once in summer, with a depth requirement of over 20 centimeters. Various localities are now vigorously preparing fertilizer.

    Xi'an, August 20th (Our Newspaper) - The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all localities in the province to vigorously grasp favorable factors, overcome various difficulties, and ensure that autumn planting work is done well.

    The Provincial Party Committee has instructed all localities to seize every opportunity of intermittent rain and showers to deeply plow wheat fields while preserving moisture. At the same time, small-scale water conservancy projects should be vigorously developed. In the Guanzhong region, the main wheat-producing area, the existing irrigable wheat fields are about 7 million mu, which needs to be expanded to about 8 million mu. Areas with conditions for irrigation should seize the opportunity to level the land, and areas without irrigation conditions should promptly harrow the land to preserve moisture when it rains.

    The Provincial Party Committee also requires all localities to actively carry out fertilizer accumulation campaigns, while continuing to promote rational close planting, meticulous selection of good seeds, and the implementation of strip sowing to ensure timely sowing.

    To strengthen leadership and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, the Provincial Party Committee proposed: Before the end of August, the area, yield, and increased production measures for autumn sowing should be implemented in the production teams, mobilizing the masses to speak out and debate, summarize experience, and boost morale. From preparation for planting, sowing, to harvesting, fixed personnel should be assigned to implement a responsibility system of inspection and acceptance, with indicators to the fields, measures to the fields, management to the groups, and responsibilities to the individuals. The campaign of large-area high-yield competition should be continued, and high-yield fields should be supported and encouraged. A command post should be established at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels during the sowing period, with the first secretary of the Party taking personal command. (Wu Gang)

    Our Newspaper reports that the vast number of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are preparing for autumn sowing early, striving for an even greater wheat harvest next year.

    This year, the suburbs' more than one million mu of winter wheat experienced the impact of late frost, drought, and hail, but the unit area yield still increased by more than 20% compared to last year, and the total output exceeded last year by 36.7%.

    Recently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting attended by Party secretaries at all levels, summarizing this year's experience in achieving high wheat yields and deploying autumn sowing work. The meeting preliminarily arranged the wheat planting area for this autumn, and made overall arrangements for the proportion of vegetable, cash crop, and wheat planting areas, trying to plant as much wheat as possible without affecting the expansion of vegetable fields.

    Currently, autumn sowing preparation work in the suburbs has already begun. Various communes are planning wheat fields, mobilizing the masses to discuss targets and increased production measures. Arrangements for wheat land, seeds, fertilizer, labor, farming tools, and water conservancy facilities are required to be implemented in each production team as soon as possible. People's Communes in Shunyi District have launched a fertilizer accumulation blitz, preparing nearly 4,000 catties of fertilizer for each mu of wheat land.

    Relevant units in Beijing are intensifying support for wheat planting preparation work. The department in charge of agricultural machinery work has prepared more than 2,000 various types of sowing machines for wheat planting, and some damaged tractors are being repaired. The department in charge of seed management recently convened a seed allocation meeting, organizing various districts to adjust and allocate superior wheat seeds. (Wang Zhaoyue)

    Our Newspaper reports that People's Communes in Yangzhong County are actively preparing for autumn planting while strengthening the late-stage management of mid-season rice.

    Yangzhong County's autumn planting started more than a month earlier than in previous years, and the preparation work is becoming increasingly thorough. The commune management districts first started by fully mobilizing the masses to summarize the experience of this year's summer harvest, discussed and formulated the autumn planting layout according to local conditions, and quickly implemented it in the teams and fields. This year's autumn planting layout made reasonable adjustments based on the principles of both increasing unit yield and increasing total output, and taking into account both one season and the whole year: maintaining a certain number of single-crop wheat fields, expanding the intercropping area of three wheat crops and green manure, so that both unit yield and total output can increase, and three wheat crops and green manure can leap forward.

    To ensure that this year's autumn planting crops have a sufficient quantity and quality of base fertilizer, all communes and production teams have seized the characteristics of summer, when everything is green and fertilizer sources are abundant, and fertilizer production is highly effective, arranging more than 5% of the labor force to intensively ferment fertilizer. So far, more than 26 million dan of various fertilizers have been accumulated, with an average of more than 150 dan of base fertilizer per mu of autumn-planted land. The fine fertilizer accumulated by more than 100,000 pigs and sheep throughout the county is reserved for wheat wintering and greening topdressing.

    All commune production teams attach particular importance to seed selection. The selected seeds are designated for special storage, managed by special personnel, and sealed with plant ash to prevent rat and insect bites.

    To solve the difficulty of insufficient labor for autumn harvest and autumn planting, various commune production teams are repairing old farm tools and reforming new farm tools. At the same time, all localities are strengthening the protection of plowing cattle. All 2,319 plowing cattle in the county are now strong, all with more than eight points of fatness, striving for all plowing cattle to have ten points of fatness to meet the needs of autumn planting.

    因地制宜制订种麦计划  增产措施落实到队到田
    河北新疆陕西北京部署秋播保证适时种好
    据新华社讯　河北各地人民公社，总结今年小麦丰产经验，及早动手准备秋麦播种工作。
    今年河北省小麦普遍丰收。最近河北省农林厅、科协等联合召开了小麦增产技术讨论会。会上，省委号召充分运用今年的小麦增产经验，保证秋麦种好、管好，实现明年小麦更大丰收。省委还提出播种计划、包产、用工、投资、肥料、种子、工具、农药等项措施必须迅速落实到各生产小队。
    河北省各人民公社、生产队在贯彻执行措施落实的过程中，鼓干劲、争上游、劲头越来越大，一般种麦准备比往年动手早、抓得狠，而且还作出了增产的具体计划。到8月3日的统计，全省准备好麦田肥料五百亿斤，占种麦用肥30％；在水利建设上一面对现有水源和灌溉机械进行全面检修，一面打井开渠、蓄水，扩大浇地面积，全省麦田水浇地面积可达到总麦田的70％；为了实现合理密植，各社队都备足了种子，一般每亩留种二十到二十五斤。
    为了保证种好，各地都重视了土质和茬口的选择，全省90％的小麦可种在留麦地和白露节前收获的谷子、玉米等早茬作物地里。早茬麦约比去年多30％，晚茬麦仅占10％，由于今年选的茬口好，就能保证适时播种。现在不少县、社还开展了工具改革运动，检修和添置深耕、播种工具。留麦地正在进行伏耕，以便晒垡蓄水保墒。
    为了实现全面增产，在进行播种准备工作的时候，各地都采取了一手抓高产，一手抓低产和以丰产田带一般田的领导方法。
    大抓丰产田是获得今年夏季大丰收的宝贵经验，全省计划在1960年普遍搞四百斤以上大面积丰产田。
    本报乌鲁木齐20日电　天山南北冬麦播种工作即将到来，新疆维吾尔自治区各人民公社正加紧伏耕，大搞积肥，力争把冬麦种好种细。据自治区农业部门统计，今年冬麦播种面积将比1958年扩大二百万亩左右。
    自治区党委和自治区人民委员会在今年夏收前就抓紧了扩大冬麦面积的准备工作。根据多种多收的方针，指示各专区、自治州和县充分利用有利条件，提早讨论和安排冬麦播种计划。各地经过讨论后，普遍提出了扩大冬麦面积的计划。自治区对各地上报计划根据各地自然条件、劳动力和铁路沿线人口增加等情况，进行了全面研究和安排，然后下达了全区冬麦播种面积的计划。目前这个计划已落实到人民公社。
    为保证明年小麦丰收，自治区领导部门在南北疆分别召开了种麦准备工作现场会议，会上还总结了今年小麦丰产的经验。各县和人民公社在会议之后，陆续召开了丰产经验座谈会，因地制宜地订出了种冬麦的技术措施。目前全疆在边收边打中已选好将近三分之一的冬麦良种。各地人民公社在夏收接近结束时，立即组织了犁地专业队，抓紧伏天时机伏耕冬麦地，力争把大部分冬麦地在伏天耕一遍，深度要求达到二十公分以上。现在各地正在大力准备肥料。
    本报西安20日电　中共陕西省委要求全省各地大抓有利因素，战胜各种困难，保证作好秋播工作。
    省委已指示各地要抓紧片雨阵雨，抢墒深翻麦田；同时大搞小型水利。在小麦主要产区的关中地区，现有能灌溉的约七百万亩左右麦田，需要扩大到八百万亩左右；有条件灌溉的地区，应抓紧平整土地，没灌溉条件的地区遇雨时及时耙地保墒。
    省委还要求各地积极开展积肥运动，同时继续推行合理密植、精选良种、实行条播，保证及时播种。
    为了加强领导和调动群众积极性，省委提出：8月底以前要把秋播面积、产量和增产措施落实到生产小队，发动群众鸣放辩论，总结经验，鼓足干劲；从备耕、播种直到收获，固定专人，实行指标到田、措施到田、管理到组、责任到人的检查验收责任制度；继续开展大面积丰产竞赛运动，支持和鼓励高产田；播种期从省、专区到县要成立指挥部，由党的第一书记亲自挂帅。　（吴钢）
    本报讯　北京郊区广大农民提早准备秋播，力争明年小麦获得更大丰收。
    今年郊区的一百多万亩冬小麦，经历了晚霜、干旱、冰雹的侵袭，但单位面积产量仍比去年增加两成多，总产量超过去年36.7％。
    最近，中共北京市委召开了有各级党委书记参加的会议，总结了今年小麦丰产的经验，部署了秋播工作。会议上初步安排了今秋种麦面积，统筹安排了蔬菜、经济作物和小麦播种面积的比例，在不影响扩大菜田的原则下，尽量多种小麦。
    目前，郊区秋播准备工作已经展开，各公社正在规划麦田，发动群众讨论指标和增产措施。关于种麦地块、籽种、肥料、劳力安排、耕种工具、水利设施，要求尽快落实到各生产队。顺义区各人民公社已开展了积肥突击运动，为每亩麦田准备了近四千斤肥料。
    北京市有关单位正在加紧支援种麦准备工作。领导农业机械工作的部门已经为种麦准备了两千多台各式播种机，一些损坏的拖拉机正在修理。管理种籽的部门最近召开了种籽调拨会议，组织各区调剂优良麦种。　（王昭钺）
    本报讯　扬中县各人民公社在加强中稻后期管理的同时，积极做好秋种的准备工作。
    扬中县今年秋种的动手时间比往年要提早一个多月，准备工作也愈做愈充分。各公社管理区首先从充分发动群众总结今年夏熟大丰收的经验入手，因地制宜讨论制订了秋种布局，并迅速落实到队到田。今年的秋种布局根据既提高单产又增加总产，既照顾一季又考虑全年的原则作了合理的调整：保持一定数量的单种麦田，扩大三麦绿肥夹种面积，使单产总产都有增长，三麦、绿肥都能跃进。
    为了保证今年秋种作物有足够数量和质量的基肥，各公社、生产队都抓住夏季遍地皆青，肥源充足，造肥肥效高的特点，安排了5％以上的劳力大沤肥料。目前为止，已积各种肥料二千六百多万担，平均每亩秋种田有基肥一百五十多担。全县十多万头猪羊所积的精肥，留作麦子越冬、返青追肥使用。
    各个公社生产队都特别重视选种工作。选好的种子确定专仓、专人保管，并用草木灰封头，防鼠虫咬蛀。
    为了解决秋收秋种劳力不足的困难，各个公社生产队都在动手整修旧农具，改制新式农具。同时，各地都加强耕牛保护。全县二千三百十九头耕牛，现在头头健壮，都在八个膘以上，争取头头耕牛十个膘以适应秋种的需要。
