　　The Heart's Field Naturally Has Sweet Dew

    A prolonged drought without rain can lead to disaster. Historically, records of severe droughts have described scenes of dust rising like smoke, thousands of miles of red land, and not a blade of grass growing. The people of Henan Province used to describe their deep suffering as "the four scourges of Henan: water, drought, locusts, and Tang," considering drought as devastating as the exploitation by Kuomintang's Tang Enbo. It is evident that drought cannot be ignored.

    However, whether it rains or not is up to the heavens, but whether a drought becomes a disaster depends on people. Prolonged lack of rain only becomes a disaster when people fail to prevent and control it. In the past, people often missed the opportunity for prevention and control. Under reactionary rule, isolated and helpless farmers had no way to prevent drought before it occurred, and had no power to remedy the situation once it had. Thus, people generally had to brace themselves and wait for rain; if it didn't come, they would cry to the heavens and beg, carrying willow branches and dragon king sedan chairs everywhere under the blazing sun—this was what was called praying for rain. If prayer didn't work, there was only one path left: to flee. Those who couldn't escape could only die. At that time, some people tried to fight against drought, but due to the lack of a unified and organized force, it was to no avail. So, if there was no drought, everything was fine; but once there was a drought, it became a disaster.

    Now, we are taking another path, which is to organize to prevent, resist, and relieve drought. We have been on this road for more than a year, and we have succeeded every time. I remember in 1945, several liberated areas experienced drought. The Party called for drought resistance and preparedness for famine. The Party, government, military, and people were all mobilized. Because we acted early, the drought did not become a disaster, and we got through those days safely. At that time, in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, there was a Ganquan County where a group of primary school students also participated in drought resistance. They planted some vegetables, and when there was no rain, they found water to irrigate them. When the rivers and ditches dried up, they dug ditches and built dams. They had no other tools, only shovels and washbasins, but in one night they watered 20,000 basins of water. Their vegetables later had a bumper harvest. This event was recorded in a small section of the Yan'an Liberation Daily in July 1945.

    Why mention the story of these primary school students? Naturally, because the spirit of these children was very valuable and moving, and can still give us encouragement; but more importantly, our conditions today, from whatever aspect you look at it, are much stronger than those of those children at that time. Therefore, comparing them can make it clearer that mobilizing to prevent and resist drought is the only correct and feasible path. In terms of organized strength, we have the people's communes, which are far superior to a group of primary school students; in terms of equipment, we are far superior to shovels and washbasins; in terms of technology, the difference is even greater. The Party's experience in leading drought resistance and the people's enthusiasm and drive are also much stronger than then. Therefore, we can exert even greater power. Isn't that so? In Henan Province, the entire population went into action to fight the drought demon, and in half a month they irrigated more than 30 million mu of land; "Who says it's difficult to draw water from high mountains? Liberated thought opens up water sources," the red flag of drought resistance in mountainous areas flew on Mount Xiannv in Hubei Province; by the end of July, the people of 54 drought-stricken counties and cities in Shandong Province had rushed to irrigate more than 4 million mu of land; the people of Jinnan Prefecture in Shanxi Province "strove for every drop of water, protected every seedling, ensured a good harvest on irrigated land, and prevented production decline on dry land"... It can be seen that the drought has not scared us, but has instead created an opportunity for us to show our great power. Under the Party's encouragement, people have shown even greater enthusiasm, more liberated thinking, and more heroic deeds in the face of severe drought. People have a certain confidence in overcoming natural disasters, and they have made bold statements: "Drought losses have a limit, but the potential for increased production is endless"; "Subdue the drought and lock up the red dragon"; "Resist drought to the end and vow to win a bumper harvest"; "If the fields are dry, the heart is not willing; human determination can overcome heaven."

    Mythological legends say that in the Guanyin Bodhisattva's treasure bottle, there is a kind of sweet dew that can save a severe drought just by sprinkling it with a willow branch. It is said that the people who pray for rain wear willow branches because of this legend. In fact, if there is such sweet dew, it is not in the treasure bottle, but in the hearts of the people. The sweet dew in the hearts of the people is drive. As long as our drive does not run dry, drought will be difficult to become a disaster. It is not terrible that the sky does not rain; what is terrible is that the sweet dew in our heart's field dries up. As long as we protect this sweet dew in our heart's field at all times, overcoming the reliance on the sky for rain and preventing and controlling drought as early as possible before it occurs; after drought has occurred, we must overcome pessimistic and disappointed emotions and quickly rescue the situation. As long as we have sufficient drive, act promptly, and plan meticulously, we can turn a severe drought into a non-disaster, a small drought into a bumper harvest, and a non-drought into an even greater bumper harvest; even if a disaster has already occurred, we can turn a major disaster into a minor one, and a minor disaster into nothing.

　　心田自有甘露
　　庄农
    久旱不雨，可以酿成灾。历史上关于苦旱的记载，有过旱尘生烟，赤地千里，寸草不生的形容。河南人民过去形容自己深重的灾难时，曾说“河南四荒，水、旱、蝗、汤”，把旱看作比国民党汤恩伯的盘剥一样厉害。可见，对旱的确不能忽视。
    但是，下不下雨虽然在天，旱成不成灾却在人。日久不雨只是在人们失去防治时才成灾的。而过去人们往往容易失去防治的时机。在反动统治下孤立无援的农民，在旱灾来临以前既无从防治，对已成的旱象又有什么挽救的力量呢？于是一般人只好硬着头皮等天下雨；等不来便哭天嚎地地去哀求，大日头底下，戴了柳枝，抬了龙王轿子到处跑，这就是所说的祈雨；求又不来，结果只剩了一条路，逃。逃不开的只好死。那时，也有人设法同旱灾斗争过，但是由于缺乏统一的有组织的力量，无济于事。所以不旱则已，一旱便成灾。
    现在我们走的是另一条路，这就是组织起来防旱、抗旱、救旱。这条路我们走了不只一年，而且是回回走回回通。记得1945年，几个解放区都遇旱。党号召抗旱备荒。党政军民都动员起来了，由于动手得早，旱并没有成灾，日子平安的度过来了。那时候，在陕甘宁边区有个甘泉县，一群小学生，也参加了抗旱，他们种了些菜，天旱无雨，就动手找水浇，河沟干浅，他们就动手挖沟垒堰，没有别的工具，只是铁锨和脸盆，但是一夜之间，他们曾浇了两万盆水，他们的菜后来丰收了。这件事，在1945年7月份延安解放日报上曾有一小段记载。
    为什么要提这么一群小学生的事呢？自然因为这群小孩子的精神很可贵很动人，至今仍然能给我们一种鼓舞力量；但更重要的是我们今天的条件，无论从哪一个方面来说，都比那个时候，那群孩子们强的多。因此，用来比较一下，就可以更明白地看出，动员起来防旱抗旱是唯一正确可行的道路。在组织力量上我们有了人民公社，远胜过一群小学生；在器材上我们远胜过铁锨和脸盆，在技术上就更高得不能比。党领导抗旱的经验和人民的干劲、热情，也都比那时强的多。因此我们能发挥更大的威力。不是吗？河南省全民出征大战旱魔，半个月就浇地三千多万亩；“谁说高山水难引，思想解放水源开”，湖北省仙女山上飘起了山区抗旱红旗；山东省受干旱的五十四个县市的人民到7月底已经抢浇了四百多万亩地；山西省晋南专区人民“滴水必争，株苗必保，水地保丰收，旱地不减产”……可见得天旱并没有吓住我们，反而给我们造成了一个大显神威的机会。在党的鼓舞下，人们在大旱面前，干劲更加发扬，思想更加解放，英雄事迹也更加倍出了。人们有一定战胜天灾的信心，他们发出豪言壮语：“干旱损失有底，增产潜力无穷”；“降服旱灾、锁住赤龙”；“抗旱到底，誓夺丰收”；“田干心不甘，人定胜过天”。
    神话传说中说，观音大士的宝瓶里，有一种甘露水，只要用柳枝洒滴就可以救大旱。据说祈雨的人们戴柳枝就是由这个传说来的。其实，如果有这种甘露水的话，并不在宝瓶里，而是在人民的心里。人民心里的甘露水就是干劲。只要我们干劲不竭，旱就很难成灾。天不下雨不可怕，可怕的就是我们心田里的甘露干涸。只要我们时刻保护这心田里的甘露，在未旱之前，克服靠天下雨的依赖思想，及早防治；在既旱之后要克服悲观失望的情绪，迅速抢救。只要我们干劲充足、动手及时、策划周密，我们就能使大旱不灾，小旱丰收，不旱更丰收；已成灾的，也能大灾化小，小灾化无了。
