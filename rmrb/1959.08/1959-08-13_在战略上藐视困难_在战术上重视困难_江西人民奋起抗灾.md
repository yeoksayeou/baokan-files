    Strategically Despise Difficulties, Tactically Value Difficulties
    Jiangxi People Rise Up to Fight Disaster
    (Our newspaper Nanchang, August 12th dispatch) Determined to overcome drought and insect pests, and striving to win a bumper autumn harvest, Jiangxi has launched a vigorous anti-drought and pest extermination campaign.
    Since July, Jiangxi has had little rain, and so far more than four million mu of crops in the province have been affected by drought, and insect plagues have occurred in some areas. The Jiujiang, Ji'an, and Yichun prefectures are experiencing relatively severe drought. These three prefectures have now been mobilized, with hundreds of thousands of people投入into the fight against drought. After more than half a month of hard work, great achievements have been made.
    Areas that have completed or basically completed the "double rush" (抢收早稻, 抢种晚稻, rush to harvest early rice, rush to plant late rice) task are focusing on drought resistance and pest control; in areas where drought and insects are serious, and the task of harvesting and planting is also large, three teams have been formed, and the "double rush," drought resistance, and pest control are proceeding in three ways. In the anti-drought and pest extermination campaign, various places have used forums, battlefield meetings, and on-site meetings to summarize and exchange experiences in finding water sources, vigorously mobilizing the masses to block rivers and build dams, build embankments in streams, store water in sections, dig canals, deepen pond bottoms, and also find ditches on the mountainside, dig springs at the foot of the mountain, open wells and dig caves, and search for water sources in a big way. Xingzi, Xiushui, Wuning, Duchang and other counties have found more than 1,200 water sources, each of which can irrigate five to ten mu of crops, and more can irrigate twenty to thirty mu. At the same time, various places have also implemented special management, water allocation, water conservation, and rational water use, using living water first, then stagnant water, using weir water first, then pond water, irrigating upper hills first, then lower hills, and irrigating serious areas first, then general areas, opening up new sources and reducing expenditure, to ensure long-term irrigation.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the movement, the first secretaries of party committees at all levels personally took charge, and the agricultural secretaries specifically managed it, with both division of labor and cooperation; both focusing on key points and taking into account the overall situation. Party organizations at all levels also grasped ideological work in the anti-drought movement, educating the masses to establish the idea of "strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing difficulties," and actively carrying out the struggle against disasters. All relevant departments also closely cooperated and fully supported the central task of drought resistance and pest control. Commercial departments promptly allocated various anti-drought tools and pesticides. The handicraft industry mobilized handicraft workers to form repair teams, which went to rural areas to repair anti-drought tools and pesticides. At present, Jiujiang Prefecture has used waterwheels to fight drought and rush-plant more than 253,000 mu of late rice, rush-planted more than 22,000 mu of corn, etc., and has freed 225,500 mu of middle rice and single-season late rice from the threat of drought. More than 472,000 mu of cotton in the entire region have been sprayed with DDT pesticides two to three times on average, and some have been sprayed five to six times, basically preventing the spread of cotton pests.

    在战略上藐视困难　在战术上重视困难
    江西人民奋起抗灾
    本报南昌12日电　坚决战胜干旱和虫害，奋力夺取秋季大丰收，江西掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗旱灭虫运动。
    7月份以来，江西少雨，至今全省已有四百多万亩作物受旱，部分地区并发生了虫灾。旱情较严重的是九江、吉安、宜春三个专区。现在这三个专区已紧张动员起来，数十万人投入抗旱斗争，经过半个多月的奋战，已取得很大成绩。
    已完成和基本完成“双抢”（抢收早稻、抢种晚稻）任务的地区，以抗旱、灭虫为主；在旱、虫严重，收种任务又较大的地区，则组成了三套人马，“双抢”、抗旱、灭虫三路并进。在抗旱、灭虫运动中，各地都以座谈会、战地会、现场会等形式，总结、交流寻找水源的经验，大力发动群众拦河筑坝，溪水筑垱，节节蓄水，开挖渠道，深挖塘底，并到山腰找沟，山脚挖泉，开井挖洞，大找水源。星子、修水、武宁、都昌等县，共找出水源一千二百多处，每处可灌溉作物五到十亩，多的可灌二十至三十亩。与此同时，各地还实行了专人管理、调剂用水、节约用水、合理用水，先用活水、后用死水，先用堰水、后用塘水，先灌上丘、后灌下丘，先灌严重的、后灌一般的，开源节流，保证长期灌溉。
    为了加强对运动的领导，各级党委都由第一书记亲自抓，农业书记具体管，又分工、又配合；又突击重点、又兼顾全面。各级党组织也抓紧了抗旱运动中的思想工作，教育群众树立“在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难”的思想，对灾害积极开展斗争。各有关部门，也围绕抗旱、灭虫这个中心，密切配合，全力支持。商业部门及时调拨各种抗旱工具和农药械。手工业部门动员了手工业工人组成修理小组，分赴各地农村，巡回修理抗旱工具和农药械。目前九江专区已车水抗旱、抢种晚稻二十五万三千多亩，抢种玉米等二万二千多亩，并使二十二万五千多亩中稻和一季晚稻摆脱了旱象威胁。全区四十七万二千多亩棉花，普遍喷射滴滴涕农药二至三次，部分喷射五至六次，基本上制止了棉花害虫蔓延。
