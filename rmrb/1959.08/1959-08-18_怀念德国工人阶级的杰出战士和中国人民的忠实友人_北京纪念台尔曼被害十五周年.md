Xinhua News Agency, August 17th. The China-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association held a report meeting in Beijing tonight to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the murder of Ernst Thalmann, the great leader of the German working class and the Communist Party. Comrade Thalmann was murdered by Hitler's fascist elements fifteen years ago, on August 18th.

Liu Aifeng, Vice President of the China-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association, said in his speech at the report meeting: Comrade Thalmann was not only an outstanding fighter of the German working class, but also a loyal friend of the Chinese people. When we were in a period of arduous struggle, Comrade Thalmann gave the Chinese people strong support. He also said: We hold the most sublime respect for Comrade Thalmann’s fighting life, his infinite loyalty to the cause of the German working class, and his concern for the Chinese people's liberation struggle.

The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the German Democratic Republic Embassy in China, Mr. Bree, was invited to speak at the meeting. He briefly introduced the heroic fighting life of Comrade Thalmann to several hundred Beijing listeners. Bree concluded his speech by saying: The goals for which Comrade Thalmann fought have been realized in the German Democratic Republic and in many parts of the world. The German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China are inseparable parts of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and they are also loyal allies fighting together for the ideals of Marxism-Leninism.

After the speeches, the German Democratic Republic biographical film "Thälmann" was shown. Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and directors of the Friendship Association in Beijing, staff of the German Democratic Republic Embassy in China, and experts in Beijing attended the report meeting tonight.

Ernst Thalmann

On August 18, 1944, Ernst Thalmann gave his precious life for his lofty ideals. Although Comrade Thalmann was harmed by the collapsing Hitler fascists, his name and influence will forever live in people's hearts. As Comrade Wilhelm Pieck said: "Thalmann's name is a great and solemn symbol of the struggle of honest and upright people against the fascist world and the world of war, and in support of the world of peace and the world of socialism. Thalmann's name is a signal for people who demand peace."

Thalmann was born on April 16, 1886, in Hamburg, Germany, to a worker's family. Throughout his revolutionary activities, he had a flesh-and-blood connection with the working class, and he worked as a worker in different industries for twenty-two years. At the age of sixteen, Thalmann was already a member of the Social Democratic Party and a member of the trade union. During the First World War, he withdrew from the Social Democratic Party and became a member of the German Independent Social Democratic Party. In December 1920, the revolutionary elements of the German Independent Social Democratic Party, under the influence of Thalmann, united with the German Communist Party. In 1924, Thalmann was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, and in 1925 he was elected as the Chairman of the German Communist Party.

In the struggle against fascism, Thalmann called on the German people to be friendly with the Soviet people, saying: "The attitude towards the Soviet Union determines which camp one leans towards in German political issues, either towards the revolutionary camp or towards the counter-revolutionary camp." Thalmann knew that consolidating the worker-peasant alliance was an important key to winning the struggle. The program of helping peasants formulated by the German Communist Party under Thalmann's leadership laid the foundation for a solid fighting alliance between the working class and the working peasants. In January 1933, Hitler's bandits seized power in Germany. After Hitler came to power, Thalmann still did everything possible to establish an anti-fascist united front in order to launch a joint struggle to overthrow the Hitler regime. In those darkest years, weeks after Hitler's bandits burned down the German Reichstag, they arrested him in Berlin, completely isolating him from the world, and he spent eleven and a half long years in prison. On August 18, 1944, the bandits cowardly murdered this most outstanding leader of the German workers' movement. (Soviet)

　　怀念德国工人阶级的杰出战士和中国人民的忠实友人
　　北京纪念台尔曼被害十五周年
    新华社17日讯　中国德意志民主共和国友好协会今晚在北京举行报告会，纪念德国工人阶级和共产党的伟大领袖恩斯特·台尔曼被害十五周年。台尔曼同志是在十五年前的8月18日被希特勒法西斯分子杀害的。
    中国德意志民主共和国友好协会副会长刘皑风在报告会上的讲话中说：台尔曼同志不仅是德国工人阶级杰出的战士，也是中国人民忠实的朋友，当我们正处在艰苦斗争的年代，台尔曼同志就给了中国人民有力的支持。他还说：我们对台尔曼同志战斗的一生和他对德国工人阶级事业的无限忠诚以及对中国人民解放斗争的关怀，怀着极其崇高的敬意。
    德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办布里应邀在会上讲话。他向几百名北京听众扼要地介绍了台尔曼同志英勇战斗的一生。布里最后在讲话中说：台尔曼同志为之而斗争的目标，已经在德意志民主共和国和全世界很多地方得到实现。德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可分割的组成部分，也是为马克思列宁主义的理想而共同斗争的忠实盟友。
    讲话以后，放映了德意志民主共和国传记片“台尔曼传”。出席今晚报告会的有对外文化联络委员会副主任罗俊和友协在京理事，德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆工作人员及在京专家也出席了报告会。
     恩斯特·台尔曼
    1944年8月18日，恩斯特·台尔曼为了崇高的理想而付出了他的宝贵的生命。台尔曼同志虽然遭到面临崩溃的希特勒法西斯的残害，但他的名字和影响却永远活在人们的心中。正如威廉·皮克同志所说的：“台尔曼的名字，是正直诚实的人们反对法西斯世界和战争世界以及拥护和平世界和社会主义世界的斗争的伟大庄严的象征。台尔曼的名字是要求和平的人们的信号。”
    台尔曼1886年4月16日生于德国汉堡一个工人的家里。在他一生的革命活动中，他与工人阶级有着骨肉般的联系，他曾经做过二十二年的不同行业的工人。台尔曼在他十六岁时，就已经是社会民主党党员和工会会员了。第一次世界大战期间，他退出了社会民主党而成为德国独立社会民主党的党员。1920年12月，德国独立社会民主党的革命分子在台尔曼的影响下同德国共产党联合起来。1924年，台尔曼被选为德国共产党的中央委员，1925年被选为德国共产党主席。
    在反对法西斯主义的斗争中，台尔曼号召德国人民和苏联人民友好，他说：“对苏联的态度问题也就决定在德国政治问题上倒向哪一个阵营，倒向革命阵营还是倒向反革命阵营。”台尔曼知道巩固工农联盟是争取斗争胜利的重要关键，德国共产党在台尔曼领导下所制定的帮助农民的纲领，奠定了工人阶级和劳动农民的巩固战斗同盟的基础。1933年1月，希特勒匪徒夺取了德国的政权。希特勒上台后，台尔曼仍然尽一切力量来建立反法西斯的统一战线，以便发动联合斗争，推翻希特勒政权。在那最黑暗的年月里，希特勒匪徒在焚毁德国国会后数星期，在柏林逮捕了他，使他和世界完全隔绝，在狱中度过了十一年半的漫长岁月。1944年8月18日，匪徒们卑怯地杀害了这位德国工人运动最卓越的领袖。　（苏）
