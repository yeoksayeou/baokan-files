Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 1st: Workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company are launching an increase production and practice economy campaign with the goal of high output, high quality, and low cost, striving for a full red August and to comprehensively fulfill the third quarter's steel production plan to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee held a meeting of responsible cadres from various factories and mines on the afternoon of July 31st, summarizing the work of July and deciding to organize all workers of the factories and mines to immediately launch an increase production and practice economy campaign to ensure a full red August production. The meeting also required leading cadres at all levels to continue to go to the front lines of production, be with the masses, overcome the intense heat, and organize a production upsurge.

The workers of the five fixed-type large open-hearth furnaces, who overproduced more than 11,000 tons of high-quality steel in July, decided to continue to organize technical performance competitions in August to solve some existing problems and make August's production even better. The workers of Open-Hearth Furnace No. 22 proposed to resolutely ensure that the open-hearth furnace does not leak steel or run steel in August, maintain the furnace body, and complete the August plan ahead of schedule. The workers of each open-hearth furnace in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant are summarizing their work in July and have put forward many measures to ensure the completion of the August plan.

The entire staff of the Ironmaking Plant are determined to overcome the heat in August and extensively carry out post competitions, opponent competitions, and inter-factory competitions. On the basis of these competitions, they will launch mutual aid competitions with the workers of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking system. On July 27, representatives of the ironmaking systems of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Benxi Iron and Steel Company met in Anshan, summarized and evaluated the results of the second quarter's mutual aid competition, and signed the third quarter's mutual aid competition contract. Entering August, No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces, these old competitors, have launched new competition activities. The workers of Blast Furnace No. 3 issued a challenge to Blast Furnace No. 9, determined to continue to vigorously maintain the taphole, strive to win again in August, and maintain the red flag of victory won in July. After receiving the challenge, the workers of Blast Furnace No. 9 held a production meeting on the 1st, proposing to ensure the smooth operation of the blast furnace in August, defeat Blast Furnace No. 3, and regain the red flag of victory.

After overfulfilling the July plan for steel billets and steel products, the workers of each steel rolling mill were full of joy and enthusiastically threw themselves into the production battle in August. On the first day of August, the No. 1 Blooming Mill launched a major evaluation and summary, and a heated opponent competition was launched between individuals and individuals, and between teams and teams. The workshops and Party branches of the No. 1 Medium Plate Mill held meetings a few days ago to discuss measures to ensure the completion of the August plan, striving for a good start in August. The workers of the first shift in August—Shift C—rolled out high-quality steel plates from midnight to eight o'clock in the morning on the 1st, exceeding the plan by 32.5%.

The workers of units such as the Chemical General Plant, the Sintering General Plant, and the Power Plant also stated that after overfulfilling the July plan, they would continue their efforts to supply more and better sintered ore, coke, and air volume to ensure that the blast furnace eats its fill and eats well. The workers of the Chemical General Plant conducted a major inspection of equipment to ensure that equipment such as coke pushing machines, conveyor belts, and motors are in good condition, striving to produce more high-quality coke in August. The workers of the Sintering General Plant are preparing to extensively carry out competitions to produce high-iron-content sintered ore to supply the blast furnace.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 1st: After achieving significant results in production in July, the workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company proposed to seize the opportunity, work hard in August and September, and strive for greater victories to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

In July, the output and quality of steel at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company both improved significantly compared to June. In order to complete the heavier production tasks in August, the company's Party committee has recently held a series of meetings, combining the inspection of production from January to July, mobilizing the masses to speak out and discuss, further exposing contradictions in production, and proposing solutions; at the same time, from the company to the team, layer by layer, clarifying the situation, explaining tasks, calculating the accounts of increasing production and practicing economy, comparing the advanced, finding measures, and engaging in innovation, so that everyone is clear about the direction of their efforts and working hard with full confidence to achieve the plan.

In recent days, the company's workers have actively offered suggestions and plans to address the key production issues. The company's main keys in current production are to continue to reduce the sulfur content of pig iron and to extend the life of the furnace. The workers proposed important measures to solve these two major keys. In terms of desulfurization, the major effort is to promote neutral hot-air desulfurization furnaces. At present, various steelmaking workshops are vigorously promoting the experience of desulfurization with neutral hot-air iron melting furnaces, with desulfurization efficiency generally reaching 60%. Another 20% can be achieved by external desulfurization, which can greatly reduce the sulfur burden during smelting. In terms of extending the life of the furnace, they decided to add iron mixing furnaces to large and small open-hearth furnaces to solve the contradiction that molten iron cannot keep up with the needs of steelmaking. The Ye-style blower originally used in the converter will be replaced with a turbine blower to increase the wind pressure and volume. The brick chimney of the converter will also be replaced with an iron chimney to shorten the smelting time. In addition, it is also necessary to vigorously strengthen equipment maintenance and inspection, add necessary accessories, and so on. Now, the company's Party committee has organized a dedicated force to determine personnel, tasks, responsibilities, and schedules to ensure that these measures are implemented on schedule.

On the basis of vigorously mobilizing the masses, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has further strengthened enterprise management, improved the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, established and improved a series of responsibility systems for technical management, planning management, financial management, and other areas, and decided to conscientiously implement them in August and September. Most of the leading cadres at the factory and workshop level have recently planted "command fields," going to teams and groups to promptly summarize and promote various advanced experiences. Now, all departments and processes throughout the company have separately established "pace-setters" in terms of high output, high quality, high work efficiency, and safe production, and are vigorously carrying out an opponent competition of "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals," pushing the increase production and practice economy campaign to a new climax.

    鞍钢全力夺取八月生产满堂红
    重庆钢铁公司职工纷纷献策献计解决当前生产关键问题
    新华社鞍山1日电　鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿职工掀起以高产、优质、低成本为目标的增产节约运动，力争8月份满堂红，并且全面完成第三季度的钢铁生产计划，迎接国庆十周年。
    鞍钢党委在7月31日下午召开各厂矿负责干部会议，总结了7月份的工作，决定组织各厂矿全体职工，立即掀起增产节约运动，确保8月份的生产满堂红。会议还要求各级领导干部继续亲临生产前线，和群众在一起，战胜酷暑，组织生产高潮。
    7月份比计划多生产了一万一千多吨优质钢的五座固定式大型平炉的职工，决定在8月份继续组织技术表演竞赛，解决现存的一些问题，使8月份的生产进行的更好。二十二号平炉的职工，提出坚决在8月份做到平炉不漏钢、不跑钢，维护好炉体，使8月份计划再提前完成。第一炼钢厂各平炉的职工正在总结7月份的工作，提出了许多保证完成8月份计划的措施。
    炼铁厂的全体职工决心在8月份战胜炎热，深入展开岗位竞赛、对手竞赛和厂际竞赛。在这些竞赛的基础上，与本溪钢铁公司炼铁系统的职工展开互助竞赛。7月27日，鞍钢和本钢两个钢铁公司的炼铁系统的职工代表，在鞍钢开会，总结评比了第二季度互助竞赛的成绩，签订了第三季度互助竞赛合同。进入8月，九号、三号高炉，这两个老的竞赛对手，又展开了新的竞赛活动。三高炉职工给九高炉下了战表，决心继续大力维护出铁口，争取8月份再打胜仗，保住7月份夺得的优胜红旗。九高炉职工接到战表后，在1日召开了生产会议，提出8月份要确保高炉炉况顺行，战胜三高炉，再度夺得优胜红旗。
    各轧钢厂职工超额完成了7月份钢坯和钢材的计划以后，喜气洋洋，兴高采烈地投入了8月份的生产战斗。第一初轧厂在8月的第一天，就展开大评比大总结，个人与个人、班组与班组之间热烈地展开了对手竞赛。第一中板厂各车间、党支部在几天以前就纷纷开会，讨论了保证完成8月份计划的措施，力争8月份开门红。8月份第一班——丙班工人，在1日午夜零点到清晨八点钟轧出的优质钢板，超过计划32.5％。
    化工总厂、烧结总厂和发电厂等单位的职工，也在超额完成7月份计划之后，表示要再接再厉，供应更多更好的烧结矿、焦炭和风量，保证高炉吃饱吃好。化工总厂的职工进行设备大检查，保证推焦机、运输带、马达等设备状态良好，力争8月份出更多的优质焦炭。烧结总厂的职工准备广泛开展竞赛，生产高铁分的烧结矿，供应高炉。
    新华社重庆1日电　重庆钢铁公司的职工继7月份生产取得显著成绩之后，提出还要抓紧时机，大干8、9月，以夺取更大的胜利，迎接国庆十周年。
    7月份重庆钢铁公司钢的产量、质量都比6月份有了显著进步。为了完成8月份更加繁重的生产任务，公司党委近来召开了一系列会议，结合检查1至7月份的生产情况，发动职工群众鸣放讨论，进一步揭露生产上的矛盾，提出解决的办法；同时，从公司到小组，层层讲清形势，交代任务，算增产节约账，比先进，找措施，搞革新，使大家都明确努力方向，满怀信心地为实现计划而努力。
    连日来，全公司的职工针对当前的生产关键问题，纷纷献计献策。公司当前生产中的主要关键，一是继续降低生铁的含硫量，二是延长炉子的寿命。职工们提出解决这两大关键的重要措施，脱硫方面是大搞中性热风化铁炉。目前，各炼钢车间正在大力推广中性热风化铁炉脱硫经验，脱硫效率一般达到60％，再在炉外脱硫20％，这样就可以大大减轻冶炼时硫的负担。在延长炉子寿命方面，他们确定在大小平炉增设混铁炉，解决铁水赶不上炼钢需要的矛盾。转炉原来用的叶氏鼓风机将改为透平鼓风机，以加大风压和风量。转炉的砖烟囱也将改为铁烟囱，以缩短冶炼时间。此外，还要大力加强设备的维护检查，添置必要的配件等等。现在，公司党委已组织专门力量，定人、定事、定责任、定进度，保证使这些措施一一按期实现。
    在大力发动群众的基础上，重庆钢铁公司进一步加强了企业管理工作，健全了党委领导下的厂长负责制，建立和健全了技术管理、计划管理、财务管理等一系列的责任制度，决定在8、9月内认真贯彻执行。厂和车间一级的领导干部大多数都在最近种了“指挥田”，到班、组去及时总结推广各种先进经验。现在，全公司各个部门、各个工序都已分别树立起高产、高质、高工效和安全生产等方面的“标兵”，轰轰烈烈地开展“兵对兵、将对将”的对手竞赛，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮。
