The Yunzaobang River, a tributary of the Huangpu River, is undergoing comprehensive dredging. Upon completion, thousand-ton ships will be able to sail directly from Wusongkou to Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1. The Yunzaobang was originally a narrow inland river navigable only by barges of fifty tons or so. After the expansion and new construction of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, the iron ore they needed often had to be transported from Ma'anshan to Wusongkou, and then by barge to the factories. This was both time-consuming and expensive. The current dredging of this inland river, the first phase of the project, is 2.5 kilometers long and requires the excavation of 230,000 cubic meters of earth, equivalent to the total carrying capacity of more than 30 ten-thousand-ton ships. Upon completion, the riverbed will be widened to 40 meters and the water depth will be 3 meters, making it the widest tributary of the Huangpu River.

　　千吨轮将直驶钢厂
    黄浦江支流蕴藻浜河道正在全面疏浚。完工后千吨轮船可以从吴淞口直驶上钢一厂。蕴藻浜原来只是一条航道狭窄的内河，只能通行五十多吨的驳船。上钢一厂和上钢五厂扩建和新建后，他们所需要的矿砂，往往要从马鞍山运到吴淞口，再由驳船运到工厂。这样既费时间，运费也大。现疏浚这条内河，第一期工程全长二点五公里，要挖二十三万土方，相当三十多艘万吨轮船的总运量。完工后，河底将全面拓宽到四十米，水深三米，成为黄浦江支流中最宽的一条航道。
