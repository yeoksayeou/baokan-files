Securing a Bumper Harvest Even Without Rain
A Record of the Drought Resistance Struggle in a Miao Village
By Our Correspondent Long Wenming

    The Miao farmers of Meire Mountain Village have been engaged in a fierce battle against the drought to protect their grain for thirty-two days. Even though the wells have dried up and the pit water has been used up, they have not slackened their efforts. They are immediately making ox carts to haul water from the deep valleys in the distant mountains. After hauling it back, they sprinkle it little by little on the rice fields to keep the soil moist and ensure the normal heading, flowering, and grain filling of the mid-season rice.

    With admiration, I visited this Miao village in Longtan Commune, Huayuan County, Hunan. It was a fiery hot day, so stifling that it was hard to breathe. Walking along the rugged mountain road towards the village, suddenly, I heard the "creak, creak" of carts and the melodious Miao songs. Looking down the mountain, I saw rows of wooden buckets placed in the middle of the terraced fields, all filled with water. Groups of three to five Miao farmers were scattered throughout the fields, carrying water and pouring it into the fields. Several Miao women were gathered around the wooden buckets in the middle of the field, vigorously scooping water to irrigate the rice. Young men, holding bundles of green grass, ailanthus leaves, and corn leaves soaked in thin mud, were covering the edges of the rice plants row by row. As I approached the field, a short, plump girl pointed to the mud-covered youth and said playfully, "Comrade, is this 'midwife' up to standard?"

    "Midwife..." I had never heard of a man being a midwife in a remote Miao village, and I was puzzled for a moment. The girls giggled mischievously and pointed to the mountain opposite: "Go ask our 'midwife' captain Wu Shunwan over there; he will tell you the secret." By the time I reached the mountain, the captain had returned to the village.

    The next morning, I finally found Wu Shunwan. He was short, in his forties, wearing a blue-gray uniform, his bronze face showing shallow wrinkles. At first glance, I knew that he was a Miao farmer who had suffered much before liberation. We walked and talked about drought resistance. He told me, "Currently, the battle to resist drought and save seedlings has entered a decisive stage. These days, the commune members work until twelve o'clock every night and are unwilling to rest."

    "You have great enthusiasm," I interjected excitedly.

    "Yes, there is great enthusiasm now, but it wasn't so great from the start!"

    In early July, after the signs of drought appeared, the county party committee issued an urgent instruction, requiring all communes and production teams to immediately prevent and resist drought. However, everyone thought, "This year's water irrigation is deeper than any other year, what is there to fear?" Who knew that the sun would become fiercer day by day, and the water in the fields would dry up inch by inch. In just over ten days, 80% of the village's 175 mu of fields were dehydrated and cracked. At this time, many people became pessimistic. They went to Huayuan to sell firewood and bamboo, wanting to earn some money early to prepare for next year. At first, Wu Shunwan was also anxious, not knowing what to do. But he thought calmly: Could we really watch the grain ears die in the womb from the drought! No, we can't! We must act like midwives and safely deliver the grain ears! Especially since I am a Communist Party member, I should not give in to difficulties. The Party teaches me: A party member must be good at relying on the masses and organizing and mobilizing them. Thinking of these things, he felt enlightened and his mind calmed down. With a clear head, he became smarter.

    In the evening, a commune members' meeting was held in the whole village to discuss the issue of drought resistance together. In 1956, Meire and its surrounding areas were dry for sixty-seven days. The nearby fields were ruined by the drought but the forty-seven mu of rice paddies in Queerdi achieved a bumper harvest after being covered with leaves, green grass and mud. These fields generally yielded over 400 kilograms per mu. This living example gave everyone great encouragement. Everyone said in unison: If each of us can save one mu, then all 151 laborers in the village can save 151 mu, which means 80% of the fields can be saved!

    On the basis of unified thinking, everyone offered suggestions for drought resistance. Communist Youth League member Wu Shunsheng seemed to remember something and suddenly stood up and said to everyone: "When planting corn at the bottom of the Baban Mountain slope, I found an old manure pit filled with water. A few days ago, when I went to see the corn, the water was still so full." With this, the meeting became more lively. You say there is water in that old manure pit, he says there is a well to dig in that cave, and twenty-six pits and five ponds were proposed. According to calculations, the water in these pits and ponds can irrigate twenty to thirty mu of land. Based on the opinions of the commune members, drought resistance combat groups were formed, and it was decided to first scoop water from the ponds while spreading leaves on the fields. After five or six days of hard work, half of the drought-stricken seedlings have been saved. Talking about this, Wu Shunwan said seriously: "By giving play to the commune's unparalleled power, the problem of water shortage can be solved." He raised his hand and pointed to a hanging rock mountain five or six miles away, and said very confidently: "That is the Xiashi River, and its water will never dry up no matter how dry it is. We are rushing to make a large number of ox carts to haul the water from there to the mountain to irrigate the rice. If it is dry for one day, we will haul it for one day, if it is dry for one month, we will haul it for one month."

    We walked to the terraced fields, and the rows of wooden buckets, which had been watered last night, were filled again this morning. People were carrying, sprinkling, and covering the fields, shouting to the sky. The atmosphere of battle seemed even more intense than yesterday. The rice was covered with thick dewdrops, glittering with golden light in the morning glow, which was very lovely. Wu Shunwan squatted down and opened the corn leaves covering the wet rice plants, the soil was moist. He said happily: "Not relying on the heavens, as long as the ground is moist. Look, row after row of rice, although it has been exposed to the scorching sun for thirty-two days, it is still growing very strongly, and has already headed, flowered, and the grains are filling out. The saying 'no harvest from rice suffering from drought in the womb' no longer applies here."

    I pointed to the heavy ears of rice and asked the captain:

    "Shunwan, do the girls call you 'midwife' captain because of this 'midwifery' of the rice?"

    "Oh, these mischievous girls," he smiled and nodded, and then rushed back into the torrent of battle.

    无雨也要保丰收
    记一个苗寨的抗旱斗争
    本报记者　龙文明
    美惹山寨的苗族农民，与旱争粮的激战，已经持续了三十二天。尽管水井枯干了，坑水浇完了，但是他们并没有松劲，马上赶制牛车，跑到远山深谷底下去驮水。驮回来后又一点一点洒在禾田里，让土地湿润，保证中稻正常抽穗扬花、灌浆壮实。
    我怀着敬佩的心情，访问了湖南花垣县龙潭公社的这个苗寨。那是一个火热的太阳天，闷得人连气都透不过来。沿着崎岖的山路走向山寨，忽然，传来“吱嘎，吱嘎”的响声和嘹亮的苗歌。顺山势看去，梯田中间摆着一排一排的木桶，桶里都装满了水。三五成群的苗族农民，遍布了整个垅田，正在挑水往田里倒。几个苗族妇女，围着摆在田中间的木桶，一股劲地舀水浇禾。年青的后生们，抱着一捆捆蘸满稀泥的青草、椿叶、包谷叶，一行一行地铺盖在水稻兜边。我走近田边，一个矮胖姑娘指着那位浑身是泥的青年俏皮地说：“同志，这号
  ‘接生员’够标准吗？”
      “接生员……”边远苗寨还没有听说男的当接生员，我一时摸不着头脑。姑娘们调皮地格格格笑起来，把手指着对门山冲：“呶，到那里问问我们的‘接生’队长吴顺万吧，他会告诉你这个秘密的。”等我赶到山冲一问，队长已回山寨了。
    第二天清早，我终于找到了吴顺万。他个子不高，年纪四十开外，穿着一身青蓝便衣，古铜色的脸，已现出浅浅几道皱纹。一看，就知道他在解放前是一个饱尝酸辛的苗族农民。我们一边走，一边谈论抗旱的事。他告诉我：“目前，抗旱救苗的战斗，已经进入决战阶段。这几天，社员们那一个晚上都要搞到十二点，不肯休息。”
    “你们的干劲真大。”我兴奋地插上一句。
      “是呀，现在干劲很大，可是也不是一下就这么大的啊！”
    7月初，旱象露头以后，县委发出紧急指示，要各公社，生产队立即防旱抗旱。可是，大家认为“今年的水灌得比那年都深，怕什么。”谁知太阳一天比一天猛，田水一天干一寸，只十来天时间，全寨一百七十五亩田，80％的脱水开坼。这时，不少人悲观起来，他们下花垣街上卖柴卖竹，想赶早搞点钱顾明年。一开头。吴顺万心里也焦急，不知怎么办好。但他冷静一想：难道真的鼓着眼看谷穗掐在胎里旱死吗！不，不能！我们要像接生员一样，把谷穗安全地接生出来！特别是自己是个共产党员，更不应该向困难低头。党教导自己：一个党员要善于依靠群众，把他们组织发动起来。想到这些，他心里豁然开亮了，脑子也平静下来了。头脑一冷静，人也聪明起来了。
    晚上，全山寨召开了社员大会，共同商量抗旱问题。1956年，美惹一带旱了六十七天，附近的田都干坏了，只有雀儿地的四十七亩稻田，经过铺树叶、盖青草、糊田坎，这些田都获得了丰收，一般亩产四百多斤，这个活教材给大家很大的鼓舞。大家不约而同地说：如果我们一人能救一亩，全寨一百五十一个劳动力，就可以救一百五十一亩，就是说，80％的田可以得救！
    在思想统一的基础上，大家纷纷献计抗旱。共青团员吴顺生像想起了什么似的，蓦地站起来对大家说：“在坝班山坡下，种包谷时我发现有个老粪坑，装有满满一坑水，前几天我又到那里看包谷，水还是那么满满的。”这一说，会场更活跃了。你说那个老粪坑有水，他讲那个岩洞里有井可挖，一下提出二十六个坑和五口塘，据计算，这些坑塘的水可灌田二、三十亩。根据社员的意见，编了抗旱战斗小组，决定先戽山塘，同时打树叶铺田。经过了五、六天的苦战，受旱的禾苗已有一半转危为安。谈到这里，吴顺万严肃地说：“发挥公社无比的威力，缺水的问题就会解决。”他把手一扬，指向五、六里路开外的一条悬岩山冲，非常自信地说：“那个冲里，就是下实河，它的水再旱也干不完，我们正在赶制大批牛车，把那里的水驮上山来浇禾。它旱一天，我们就驮一天，旱一月，驮一月。”
    我们走到了垒田，一排排的木桶昨晚已浇完了水，今早又都装满了。人们挑的挑，洒的洒，盖的盖，吆喝连天。战斗的气氛，显得比昨天还要紧张。水稻结满厚厚的露珠，晨曦中，金光闪烁，十分可爱。吴顺万蹲下来，翻开盖在湿禾兜上的包谷叶，泥土湿润润的。他高兴地说：“不指天干，只要地润，瞧吧，一垅接一垅的水稻，虽然被烈日猛晒了三十二天，却仍然长得很茁壮，并且都已抽穗扬花，灌浆壮实，不出白线。‘禾遭胎旱无收成’这句话，在这里不再起作用啦”。
    我指着沉甸甸的谷穗问队长：
  “顺万，姑娘们喊你做‘接生’队长，是指水稻‘接生’这回事吗？”
      “噢，这些调皮丫头”他笑着点了点头，又奔往激战的洪流中去了。
