Xinhua News Agency, Vienna dispatch: On the sixth day (July 31st) of the 7th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship, various activities continued.
    "Young Women's Day"
    The young women participating in the festival happily spent their day – Young Women's Day.
    At 9:00 AM, 350 young women from 23 countries held a meeting in the Bavarian Building in Vienna. At 3:00 PM, the girls held a gathering at the open-air tea garden in Vienna's People's Park.
    At the meeting in the Bavarian Building, the girls divided into groups to discuss the report by Italian representative Zabeloni on "The Participation of Young Women in Social Life."
    Zabeloni said in his report that the complete emancipation of women is an important issue in modern society, and that women (including young women) can and should enjoy the same rights as men and become active participants in various events, such as the movement to strive for world peace and other socially beneficial movements.
    During the heated discussion of these issues that excited the girls, representatives from India, Indonesia, Chile, the Soviet Union, Guyana, and China's Chen Shaojian all spoke.
    At the gathering in Vienna's People's Park, young women of different skin colors and speaking different languages from the five continents sat around under the green shade, chatting intimately about their friendship. Then there were performances of artistic programs. Girls from Britain, North Korea, China, Senegal, and other countries performed songs and dances full of national characteristics.
      Youth from Socialist Countries
      Gathered Happily Together
    Youth representatives from various socialist countries also gathered together on this day for exchanges and get-togethers. Soviet youth delegation leader Pavlov spoke to warm cheers. He said in a loud voice that we all live in a unified and happy big family of socialism. We are all as close as brothers. The idea of the Seventh World Youth Festival has achieved a complete victory. Facts have proven that no one can stop our joyful songs and dances and laughter, and no one can stop the power of peace and friendship. Some people insist that the festival is "communist propaganda." If this propaganda is joyful songs, dances, and friendship, then we can only be proud of such propaganda.
    Chinese delegation leader Liu Xiyuan, Hungarian delegation leader Zoltan, and German Democratic Republic delegation leader Naumann all spoke, and their speeches unanimously expressed the great unity of the youth of various countries in the socialist camp.
    Meetings Among Youth from Various Countries Proceeded Enthusiastically
    On this day, the meeting between the Chinese delegation and more than 200 young friends from ten countries in southern Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay, was full of passion and joy. They engaged in intimate exchanges, deeply believing that their common struggle against imperialist aggression would surely be victorious.
    On this day, Chinese youth representatives, along with youth from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia, also held intimate meetings with young friends from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and other countries.
    Meetings between delegations from other countries are also proceeding enthusiastically. According to statistics, 15 to 20 meetings are held every day during the festival.
    Meetings of professional workers such as young journalists, young railway workers, young farmers, and agricultural workers were held on this day.
    Our Art Troupe Held Opening Performance
    The Chinese Art Troupe formally held the opening performance of national art programs at the Raimund Theater on the evening of July 31st. It achieved great success. More than 1,000 people came to watch the opening performance, including Austrian political figures, youth representatives from various countries participating in the festival, diplomatic envoys from various countries, and representatives from several international organizations. The performance programs strongly infected the audience here, who gave warm applause and loud cheers to each program.
    The Reactionaries' Activities Were in Vain
    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 1st dispatch: This agency's reporter reported: On the eve of the 7th World Youth Festival, a "long-tailed crow" in the skies over Vienna broke its tail. This was a plane dragging a banner opposing the festival. On the evening of the 25th, just as young people from various countries were warmly welcoming the Soviet delegation, the banner suddenly broke its line. It had to disappear amidst the young people's laughter.
    Since the opening of the festival, the idea of peace and friendship has deeply penetrated people's hearts. It is converging into a magnificent torrent, crushing all obstacles hindering it. All the conspiracies of the reactionaries attempting to obstruct and sabotage the festival are as futile as an ant trying to shake a tree.
    On the morning of the second day of the festival (July 27th), a newspaper specially published by the reactionaries during the festival to oppose the festival issued a special edition and distributed it door-to-door. The special edition asked people not to participate in any gatherings or entertainment performances of the festival, but the answer from the residents of Vienna was: As soon as evening fell, they flocked to the streets to participate in various activities of the festival. Tens of thousands of people alone watched the open-air performances.
    The reactionaries also clamored to organize a tour to the Hungarian border to "sightsee" in order to pull some of the representatives away from Vienna to weaken the momentum of the festival. However, the representatives from various countries were not interested in this at all.
    The Enemies of the Festival Made Fools of Themselves
    On the evening of July 29th, the enemies of the festival also did a stupid thing that backfired, shooting themselves in the foot. They convened a so-called Asian-African youth meeting "against colonialism" in Vienna. This time, they were attempting to peddle their private goods under the banner of "anti-colonialism." Although more than 200 people participated in the meeting, few Asian and African youth representatives could be seen at this meeting ostensibly for Asian and African youth. The conveners of the meeting pulled in more than 100 West Germans, dozens of Italians and French, and twenty or thirty Americans to make up the numbers.
    The moderators of the meeting also arranged for some disreputable figures to speak at the meeting. However, their anti-communist ravings were refuted so thoroughly by the audience that they were utterly defeated.
    Ghanaian representative Boye Dokum listed the real actions of imperialism in many countries on the African continent at the meeting to expose the hypocrisy of Western imperialist elements. He said that the imperialists arbitrarily slaughtered Africa. However, the day when all African countries gain freedom is not far away.
    In short, the organizers of the meeting originally wanted to convene this meeting as an action against the festival, but the meeting turned into a gathering to expose imperialism instead. Those disreputable figures had to slink away in disgrace.

    联欢节和平友谊巨流波澜壮阔
    反动派破坏活动接连遭到可耻失败
    本报综合报道据新华社维也纳电：第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的第六天（7月31日），各项活动继续开展。“女青年日”
    参加联欢节的年轻姑娘这一天愉快地度过了自己的节日——女青年日。
    上午九时，二十三个国家的三百五十位少女在维也纳的巴伐利亚大楼举行了会见。下午三时，姑娘们在维也纳人民公园的露天茶座里举行了联欢。
    在巴伐利亚大楼的会见会上，姑娘们分成小组讨论了意大利代表扎贝罗尼作的“关于女青年参加社会生活问题”的报告。
    扎贝罗尼在报告中说，妇女的彻底解放是现代社会的一个重要问题，妇女（包括青年妇女在内）都能够、而且应该享有和男子同等的权利，并且成为各种事件，比如争取世界和平等对社会有益的运动的积极参加者。
    在热烈讨论这些激动姑娘们的心的问题的过程中，印度、印度尼西亚、智利、苏联、圭亚那等国的代表和我国代表陈少健都发了言。
    在维也纳人民公园举行的联欢会上，来自五大洲不同肤色、操着不同语言的年轻姑娘围坐在绿荫下面畅叙友情。接着表演了文艺节目。英国、朝鲜、中国、塞内加尔等国的姑娘都表演了富有民族特色的歌舞。
      社会主义国家
      青年欢聚一堂
    社会主义各国青年代表，也在这一天上午聚会一堂，进行了交谈和联欢。苏联青年代表团长帕甫洛夫在热烈的欢呼声中讲了话。他用宏亮的声音说，我们大家生活在一个社会主义的统一的幸福的大家庭中。我们大家像亲兄弟一样的亲密无间。第七届世界青年联欢节的思想已经获得了彻底的胜利。事实已经证明，没有人能够阻止住我们的欢乐的歌舞和欢笑，没有人能阻挡和平友谊的力量。有人硬说联欢节是“共产主义宣传”，如果这个宣传是欢乐歌舞和友谊，那么我们只有为这种宣传而骄傲。
    中国代表团长刘西元、匈牙利代表团长佐尔坦、德意志民主共和国代表团长瑙曼都讲了话，他们的讲话一致表现了社会主义阵营各国青年的伟大团结。
    各国青年会见热烈进行
    这一天，中国代表团和拉丁美洲南部阿根廷、巴西、智利、乌拉圭等十个国家的二百多个青年朋友的会见，充满了激情和欢乐。他们进行了亲密的交谈，深信他们共同反对帝国主义侵略的斗争一定能够取得胜利。
    这一天，中国青年代表和苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、朝鲜、越南、蒙古等社会主义国家青年还同阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯等国青年朋友进行了亲密的会见。
    其他国家代表团相互之间的会见，也正在热烈进行中。据统计，在联欢节期间，每天的会见会将举行十五到二十个。
    在这一天举行了青年新闻工作者、青年铁路工作者、青年农民和农业工作者等专业工作人员的会见。
    我艺术团举行开幕演出
    中国艺术团，7月31日晚在雷蒙特剧院正式举行国家艺术节目的开幕演出。获得了巨大成功。前来观看开幕演出的有，奥地利政界人士、参加联欢节的各国青年代表、各国外交使节和若干国际组织的代表等一千多人。演出节目强烈地感染着这里的观众，他们对每个节目都报以热烈的鼓掌和大声喝采。
    反动派的活动白费力气
    据新华社维也纳1日电　本社记者报道：在第七届世界青年联欢节前夕，维也纳上空一只“长尾巴乌鸦”断了尾巴。这是一架拖着反对联欢节标语的飞机。在25日傍晚正当各国青年热烈欢迎苏联代表团的时候，标语突然断了线。它只好消逝在青年们的哄笑声中了。
    联欢节开幕以来，和平友谊的思想已经深入人心，它正在汇成一股波澜壮阔的巨流，摧垮一切阻挠它的种种障碍。反动派企图阻挠和破坏联欢节的一切阴谋活动，都像蜉蝣撼大树那样白费力气。
    在联欢节的第二天（27日）早晨，反动派在联欢节期间专门出版的一个反对联欢节的报纸曾出了一期特刊，并挨家挨户分发。特刊要求人们不要参加联欢节的任何集会和招待演出，但维也纳居民的回答是：一到傍晚，他们就拥向街头，参加联欢节的各种活动。单是观看露天演出的就有数万人。
    反动派还扬言说要组织一个到匈牙利边境去
  “观光”的旅行团，以此来把一部分代表从维也纳拉走以削弱联欢节的声势。但是，各国代表们对此毫无兴趣。
    联欢节的敌人出乖丢丑
    7月29日晚上，联欢节的敌人还做了一件弄巧反拙，搬砖头打了自己的脚的丑事。他们在维也纳召集了一个所谓亚非青年“反对殖民主义”的集会。这次他们是企图在“反对殖民主义”的招牌下来贩卖私货。虽然也有二百多人参加这个会议，但是，在这个名为亚非青年的集会上，看不到几个亚洲和非洲青年代表。会议的召集人却拉来了一百多名西德人，几十名意大利和法国人，二、三十名美国人来凑数。
    会议的主持人还布置了一些并不光彩的人物在会上讲话。但是，他们的反共谰言被听众驳斥得体无完肤。
    加纳代表博伊·多库姆在会上列举了帝国主义在非洲大陆上许多国家内的真正行为，来揭露西方帝国主义分子的伪善。他说，帝国主义者任意宰割非洲。但是，非洲所有国家获得自由的日子不远了。
    总之，会议的组织者本想召开这次会议作为反对联欢节的行动，结果会议反而变成了一次揭露帝国主义的集会。那些并不光彩的人物只得灰溜溜地一走了之。
