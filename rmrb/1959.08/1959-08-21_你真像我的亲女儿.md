At noon, in the children's store of the Wuhan Department Store, shop assistants were busy serving customers. An old woman in her fifties approached the counter, her eyes fixed on the children's clothes.

　　"Grandma, have a cup of tea!" Chen Peirong, a female shop assistant and Communist Party member, handed a cup of boiled water to the old woman and asked, "What kind of clothes are you looking for?"

　　The old woman told her what she wanted. Chen Peirong turned around to get the clothes and was taken aback—the old woman's expression suddenly changed! Painful wrinkles appeared on her face, and she bent over.

　　"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" Chen Peirong asked, while getting a chair for the old woman to sit down.

　　"My chest hurts," the old woman replied weakly.

　　"Where do you live?"

　　"I came from the countryside to visit my daughter in the city."

　　"Okay, I'll take you to the hospital to see a doctor first."

　　Chen Peirong explained her situation to her colleagues, wrapped up the items the old woman wanted to buy, and helped the old woman to the hospital, registered her for emergency treatment, and then helped her upstairs to see the doctor.

　　At first, the doctor and the people who were seeing the doctor there thought that Chen Peirong and the old woman were mother and daughter. Later, from their conversation and the number on Chen Peirong's clothes, they realized that she was a shop assistant taking a customer to see a doctor. Everyone started talking about it, and many admiring glances were cast at Chen Peirong. A doctor looked carefully at the work number on Chen Peirong's clothes and said humorously, "I thought our service attitude was very good! Now it seems that your service attitude is even better than ours!"

　　The doctor quickly gave the old woman an injection. Soon, the painful expression on the old woman's face gradually disappeared, and she said repeatedly, "I feel much better, much better. Thank you, girl."

　　An hour passed. Chen Peirong helped the old woman down the stairs, asked where she wanted to go, and hired a pedicab, helping the old woman into it. As the cart started moving, the old woman could hardly contain her inner excitement, and summoning her strength, she raised her voice and said, "You are just like my own daughter, come and visit me at my daughter's house another day!"

    你真像我的亲女儿
    中午，武汉市百货公司儿童商店里，营业员忙碌地接应着顾客。一位五十来岁的老太婆走近柜台，两眼落在小人衣上不停地转动着。
    “太婆，喝杯茶吧！”女营业员、共产党员陈佩容将一杯开水送到了老太婆的手里，继续问：“您要什么样的衣服？”
    老太婆说了她所要的东西。陈佩容转过身取出了衣服，不禁大吃一惊——老太婆的神色突然变了！脸上泛起了痛苦的皱纹，身子弯下去了。
    “您怎么样啦？哪里不舒服？”陈佩容边问边拿把椅子请老太婆坐。
    “胸口很疼。”老太婆无力地回答。
    “您住在哪里？”
    “我是从乡里到城里姑娘家来看看的。”
    “好，我先送你到医院去看一看病。”
    陈佩容把她的任务向旁人交代了一下，把老人要买的东西包好，就扶着老人到了医院，挂了急诊号，又扶着老人上楼看病。
    起初，医生和在这里看病的人都以为陈佩容和老人是母女，后来从她俩的说话、从陈佩容衣服的号码上发觉是一个营业员送顾客看病，大家就纷纷议论开了，许多敬佩的眼光投向陈佩容身上。一位医生仔细地看着陈佩容衣服上的工作号码，饶有风趣地说：“我还以为我们的服务态度很好啦！现在看来，你们的服务态度比我们更好呵！”
    医生很快地给老人打了一针。不久，老人脸上的痛苦表情逐渐消失了，连声说：“轻松了些，轻松了些。多谢姑娘。”
    一个钟头过去了。陈佩容扶着老人走下楼梯，问清了老人要去的地方，便雇来一辆三轮车，扶着老人坐在车上。当车子走动的时候，老人真是抑制不住内心的激动，鼓起力气，放高嗓门说：“你真像我的亲女儿，改日来接你到我姑娘家去玩一玩吧！”（附图片）
