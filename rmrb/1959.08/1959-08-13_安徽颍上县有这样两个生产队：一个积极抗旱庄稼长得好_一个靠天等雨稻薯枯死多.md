　　In Yingshang County, Anhui Province, there are two production teams:
　　One actively fights drought and the crops grow well
　　One relies on the heavens and waits for rain, resulting in withered and dead rice and sweet potatoes

　　In the anti-drought and seedling protection movement, Wangying Production Team and Xijie Production Team of Zhaoji Brigade, Zhaoji Commune, Yingshang County, Anhui Province, one actively fought drought and the crops grew very well, while the other relied on the heavens and waited for rain and suffered losses.

　　At the beginning of the anti-drought movement, Wangying Production Team paid attention to summarizing the experience of drought resistance and a good harvest last year and yield reduction due to not fighting drought. They used examples to educate the commune members to overcome all difficulties and carry out anti-drought and seedling protection work. The leaders of the production team put forward the fighting slogan: "Don't rely on the heavens, don't wait for rain, human power can surely overcome the heavens, water from the ditch can be diverted, groundwater can be dug up, water from the bottom of the pond can be carried up, water from the well can be drawn up, not a drop of water should be wasted, and even if it doesn't rain until autumn, we must ensure a good harvest." Team leader Li Yuezhao personally led an anti-drought task force of thirty-seven people, working hard for days on end, digging thirty-one water diversion canals, sinking two pond-bottom wells, and using all water sources to fill every piece of the seventy-nine mu of rice paddies with water. In addition, they also watered seventeen mu of sweet potatoes and nineteen mu of other dry-land crops. The shallowly irrigated rice generally jointed and headed, and the dry-land crops also turned from yellow to green.

　　However, the neighboring Xijie Production Team, with the same conditions, relied on the heavens and waited for rain. From the beginning of the anti-drought effort until now, only fifteen of the team's thirty-nine laborers have been fixed to use two waterwheels to fight the drought, and not a single cadre has participated. Team leader Liu Wencai said: "The drought-affected area is so large, and there are so few laborers, what can be solved by watering a little? Can the sky not rain?" As the drought developed, the team's one hundred and five mu of rice, sixty-three mu of sweet potatoes, and eighty-seven mu of other dry-land crops have become withered and yellow. On thirty mu of rice land, the field surface is so dry that it has cracked, and 15% of the seedlings have withered and died. Twelve mu of sweet potato seedlings have withered and died by 20%. The commune members regretted it very much, saying: "We have suffered because we relied on the heavens and waited for rain."

　　Recently, the Party General Branch of Zhaoji Brigade held an on-site anti-drought meeting in these two production teams. Through factual comparison, they educated the cadres of eighteen production teams. Everyone expressed that they must go all out to fight the drought and protect the seedlings, and must not rely on the heavens and wait for rain. After the meeting, the anti-drought movement in the entire brigade quickly formed a high tide.

### 安徽颍上县有这样两个生产队：一个积极抗旱庄稼长得好　一个靠天等雨稻薯枯死多

　　安徽颍上县有这样两个生产队：
　　一个积极抗旱庄稼长得好
　　一个靠天等雨稻薯枯死多
    安徽颍上县赵集公社赵集大队的王营生产队和西街生产队，在抗旱保苗运动中，一个积极抗旱，庄稼生长很好，一个靠天等雨吃了亏。
    王营生产队在抗旱运动一开始，就注意总结去年抗旱保收和不抗旱减产的经验，用实例教育社员，克服一切困难，开展抗旱保苗工作。生产队的领导提出了“不靠天，不等雨，人力定能战胜天，沟里水引上来，地下水挖上来，塘底水挑上来，井里水提上来，滴水不丢，到秋不下雨也要保丰收”的战斗口号。队长李月照亲自率领由三十七人组成的抗旱专业队，连日苦战，开挖了三十一条引水渠，打了两眼塘底井，利用一切水源，把七十九亩稻田块块灌满水。此外，还浇甘薯十七亩，其它旱粮作物十九亩。浅灌后的稻子普遍拔节、抽穗，旱粮作物也由黄转青。
    可是条件相同的邻队西街生产队，由于靠天等雨，从抗旱开始到现在，全队三十九个劳动力只固定十五人用两部水车抗旱，没有一个干部参加。队长刘文才说：“受旱面积这么大，劳力又少，浇一点能解决啥问题？天总不能不下雨吧？”随着旱情的发展，现在这个队的一百零五亩水稻、六十三亩甘薯和八十七亩其它旱粮作物已旱得卷叶发黄，有三十亩水稻，田面干得开裂，秧苗枯死15％，有十二亩甘薯苗枯死20％。社员很后悔，说：“我们就是吃了靠天等雨思想的亏”。
    最近赵集大队党总支在这两个生产队召开了一次抗旱现场会，通过事实对比，教育了十八个生产队的干部，大家都表示一定要全力抗旱保苗，不能靠天等雨。会后，全大队的抗旱运动很快形成了高潮。
