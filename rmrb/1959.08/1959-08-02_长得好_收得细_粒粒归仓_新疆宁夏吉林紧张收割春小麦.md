Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 31st: Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, are busily harvesting spring wheat. As of now, nearly one-third of the more than 5.3 million mu of spring wheat in the entire region has been harvested.

In many areas where threshing has already been completed, the yield per unit area is generally 10 to 20 percent higher than last year. Good news of bumper harvests has been continuously coming from Hotan, Kashi, Shanshan, Hami and other places where the wheat ripened earlier and was harvested faster. Shanshan County, which has always been a low-yield area for wheat, changed its past habit of not paying attention to spring wheat this year. The county applied an average of 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu to its more than 34,000 mu of spring wheat, universally top-dressed at the jointing stage, and organized farmers to launch a battle to eliminate wheat aphids in the spring, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of spring wheat throughout the county. Although Hami Prefecture suffered relatively severe natural disasters this year, the people of the entire prefecture displayed soaring enthusiasm, constantly fighting against rain, snow, floods, and aphids, enabling the more than 250,000 mu of spring wheat in the entire prefecture to still achieve a bumper harvest. Among them, the more than 70,000 mu of spring wheat that has already been harvested and threshed in Hami County has an average yield per unit area that is 20 percent higher than last year.

This newspaper reports: The Ningxia region has basically completed the harvesting of more than 2.5 million mu of wheat and more than 500,000 mu of summer miscellaneous grains, which are expected to increase by 10 to 20 percent compared to last year. In the Qujing Management Area of the Qujing Commune in Ningsuo County, the average number of bundles of wheat harvested per mu increased by one-half compared to last year. Experienced farmers who have witnessed bumper harvests could not help but say: "I have never seen so much wheat harvested per mu."

The unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat has brought a heavy workload, and the harvest season has also encountered wind, rain, and floods, which has increased the difficulty of the wheat harvest. However, the peasants after the people's communeization overcame these difficulties. In Zhongning County, five people's communes, thirty-two brigades, and two hundred and fifty-five production teams signed summer harvest cooperation contracts before the wheat harvest, providing mutual support of more than 30,000 workdays during the rush harvest period. Due to the extensive development of cooperation, the wheat harvest work not only progressed rapidly but was also carefully harvested and thoroughly cleaned up. Many communes and teams have achieved "no grains left in the fields, no ears of wheat dropped on the roads."

Xinhua News Agency reports: All parts of Jilin Province have universally started harvesting spring wheat. Many counties and communes have put forward the slogans: "Ripen a patch, harvest a patch" and "Harvest a patch, plant a patch."

At present, the entire province has entered a high tide of rushing to harvest wheat. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labor in wheat-producing communes in the Baicheng area, mutual support is universally carried out between communes and communes, management areas and management areas, and production teams and production teams, based on the principle of equal value exchange, setting off a high tide of major assault and major cooperation, ensuring timely harvesting and pulling and threshing.

While harvesting, pulling, and threshing wheat, various places have actively and properly arranged labor to plow wheat stubble land and summer sow late autumn crops. For example, in Nongan County, eight people's communes had already sown more than 2,500 mu of buckwheat by the 27th. (Attached picture)

    新疆宁夏吉林紧张收割春小麦
    据新华社乌鲁木齐31日电　新疆天山南北各族农民紧张收割春麦。全疆五百三十多万亩春麦到目前止已经收割将近三分之一。
    不少已经打了场的地区，单位面积产量一般都比去年增加一成到两成。成熟较早和收打较快的和田、喀什、鄯善、哈密等地，丰收的喜讯已经不断传来。历年都是小麦低产区的鄯善县，今年改变了已往不重视春麦的习惯，全县三万四千多亩春麦平均每亩施了一万斤底肥，拔节时普遍追了肥，春季又组织农民展开消灭麦蚜虫的战斗，使全县春小麦获得了空前丰收。哈密专区今年虽然遭到比较严重的自然灾害，但是全专区人民发挥了冲天干劲，同雨雪、洪水和蚜虫等不断展开斗争，使全专区二十五万多亩春麦仍然获得丰收。其中哈密县已经收打的七万多亩春麦，平均单位面积产量比去年增加了两成。
    本报讯　宁夏地区二百五十多万亩小麦和五十多万亩夏杂粮已基本收割完毕，今年可比去年增产一至二成。宁朔县瞿靖公社瞿靖管理区每亩麦子平均收割捆数比去年增加二分之一。经历过丰收的老农们看了都情不自禁地说：“从来没有看到一亩能收这么多麦子。”
    小麦空前丰收带来了繁重的工作量，收割期间又遇风雨和洪水，给麦收增加了困难。但是，人民公社化后的农民，战胜了这些困难。中宁县五个人民公社三十二个大队二百五十五个生产队，麦收前就签订了夏收协作合同，抢收期间互相支援了三万多个劳动日。由于广泛的展开了协作，麦收工作不但进展迅速而且割的细，收的净，很多社、队做到了“地里无漏粒，路上无遗穗”。
    据新华社讯　吉林省各地普遍开镰收割春小麦。许多县、社提出：“熟一块，割一块”和“割一块，种一块”的口号。
    目前，全省已进入抢收小麦的高潮。白城地区为解决产麦社的劳力不足的问题，在社与社、管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队之间，普遍按等价交换的原则互相支援，掀起大突击、大协作的热潮，保证了及时收割和拉打。
    各地在边割、边拉、边打小麦的同时，积极妥善地安排了劳力翻麦茬地和夏种晚秋作物。例如农安县已有八个人民公社到27日已播种荞麦二千五百多亩。（附图片）
