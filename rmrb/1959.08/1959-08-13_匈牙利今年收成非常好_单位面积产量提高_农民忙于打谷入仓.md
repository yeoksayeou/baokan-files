　　单位面积产量提高　农民忙于打谷入仓
    据新华社布达佩斯11日电　匈牙利全国夏收工作已基本结束，现在各地正忙于打谷入仓。根据农业部公布的材料，今年的收成非常好。
    据一些已打场的地区统计，今年每一霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）麦子的平均产量比去年增加了二、三百公斤。
    各地农业生产合作社今年普遍丰收。费耶尔州佩尔卡塔伊合作社的秋大麦每霍尔特平均收二千六百八十公斤，贝什尼厄伊合作社小麦每霍尔特平均收一千九百公斤。
    据赫威斯州的初步统计，农业生产合作社收获的麦子平均每霍尔特比个体农民多二、三百公斤。
    今年夏收工作组织得很好，农民们的干劲很足。到8月7日为止，全国的农业机器站已超额4％完成了任务。各地工人和机关工作人员也利用休息时间和假日去帮助合作社，特别是新成立的社进行收割。
    由于注意深耕细作、增施化肥，灌溉、除草和杀虫，今年稻子和马铃薯的生产情况也很好。现在南部地区稻子已经结穗。琼格拉德州的科帕内什国营农场的稻子，每穗有一百六十到一百八十个稻粒。预计，今年将是这个国营农场成立十年来收成最好的一年。
