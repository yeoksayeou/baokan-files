    The Coconut Tree: Nothing is Wasted
    On the coast of Hainan Island, there are rows of towering trees with large leaves, and the tops of the trunks are full of fruit. This is the coconut grove, a picturesque tropical scene.
    The coconut has a wide range of uses; it can be said that nothing is wasted. Fresh coconut meat can be eaten raw, or it can be made into various foods and candies, such as the famous coconut candy. Dried coconut meat can be pressed into coconut oil, which is used as a lubricant and soap raw material in industry. It can also be used for food and as a raw material for making artificial cream, candles, and cosmetics. The outer husk of the coconut is called coir, which can be used to make cables, mats, and brooms. The inner shell of the coconut can be used to make the best activated carbon, and it can also be processed and carved into valuable handicrafts. Coconut water is a good refreshing drink.
    Coconuts grow between 12 degrees south latitude and 17 degrees north latitude. According to statistics, Hainan Island has more than 1.5 million coconut trees, producing more than 16 million coconuts annually and about 10,000 dan of coconut oil. (Attached picture)

    椰子一身无废物
    在海南岛的沿岸，有一排排高耸入云、叶子很大的树林，树干的顶端结着累累的果实。这就是富有热带风光的椰子林。
    椰子的用途很广，可以说是一身无废物。新鲜的椰肉可以生食，也可以调制成各种食品和糖果，如著名的椰子糖等。把椰肉晒干又能榨成椰油，椰油又是工业上的润滑油和肥皂原料，还可供食用及做人造奶油、蜡烛和化妆品用油的原料。椰子的外果皮叫做椰棕，能制缆索、地席和扫帚。椰子的内壳能制最好的活性炭，还可以加工雕刻成为名贵的工艺品。椰子水更是一种良好的清凉饮料。
    椰子生长在南纬十二度至北纬十七度之间。据统计，海南岛共有椰树一百五十多万株，年产椰子一千六百多万只，椰油约一万多担。（附图片）
