    Innovative Blossoms
    —What We Saw and Heard at the Second Department Store of the Shenyang Department Store Company
    Our Correspondents Wang Dianxue (text) Li Fude (photography)
    The Second Department Store of the Shenyang Department Store Company is located on Central Avenue, the most bustling street in Shenyang, and receives 30,000 to 40,000 customers every day. Recently, reporters at this large, comprehensive department store saw and heard many new things related to technological innovation. Some innovations improved the efficiency of salespersons, some reduced their physical labor, some improved the quality of their service, and some strengthened the relationship between salespersons and customers…
    Smart Assistants
    Since the beginning of summer, more and more customers have gathered in front of the fabric counter. Many young women and mothers with children are crowding there to choose printed fabrics. The salespersons in the counter are busy moving a bolt of printed fabric for one customer and then rushing to write a payment slip for another. The salesperson glances at the "quick calculation card" and, in less than half a minute, prepares the payment slip and hands it to the customer to pay, then receives the second customer. Salesperson Gao Shufen told me that this "quick calculation card" is their powerful assistant; with its help, they can now serve two or three customers in the time it used to take to serve one.
    Then, she thoughtfully told the following story: Last year, their group added four new salespersons, who were all not very proficient at using the abacus. Once, a customer wanted to buy 16 and a half *chi* of blue serge, which cost 3.65 *fen* per *chi*. New salesperson Luo Yingnian used the abacus five or six times but was still unsure if the calculation was correct and dared not give the customer a payment slip. The customer, becoming impatient, took the abacus, calculated it herself, wrote the payment slip, and went to pay, leaving Xiao Luo almost in tears of shame. At that time, the new salespersons had to wear name tags with "Trainee" on their chests, meaning to ask customers for understanding.
    Old salesperson Li Ping, seeing this situation, decided to help the new salespersons take care of the customers. Initially, she explained for the new salespersons and sometimes used the abacus for them. But she thought that this would only provide temporary help, so how could she fundamentally solve the problem? After a few days of research, she created this "quick calculation card." On the card, she wrote the price of the fabric and filled in the amounts for half a *chi*, one *chi*, one and a half *chi*, up to twenty *chi*, attaching it to each type of fabric. Now, it only takes less than half a minute to calculate the bill. Not only new salespersons but also many old salespersons no longer use the abacus and use this "quick calculation card" instead.
    Holding and Carrying
    In front of the ceramic ware counter, I saw salesperson Tang Sufen bundling a stack of six porcelain bowls, specially making a "dead knot" on the bottom overlapping paper ropes. The customer took the stack of bowls, still worried that she had not tied them securely enough, and was about to leave, supporting them with one hand, when Tang Sufen specifically told him: "You can carry them, I guarantee the rope won't come loose." As she spoke, she took the stack of bowls, lifted them, and swung them back and forth several times, to convince the customer of her words. Another salesperson told me: "Before technological innovation, we wouldn't dare to give such a 'guarantee'. We were even afraid that the bundling wouldn't be secure enough, and we'd suggest that customers hold them."
    What the salesperson said made me think of some people I often see on the street, carefully holding a few bowls to take home. The salesperson continued to tell me a story: Once, a customer chose four plates and four bowls and asked the salesperson to bundle them up for him so he could carry them away. Less than two or three minutes later, this customer came back empty-handed and began to choose plates and bowls again. The salesperson asked him: "Didn't you just buy plates and bowls?" The customer humorously replied: "I 'sold' them again as soon as I stepped off the curb." This time, the customer repeatedly told the salesperson to bundle them up more securely. When he left, he still held the plates and bowls tightly, not feeling reassured.
    Every time a customer took plates or bowls from Tang Sufen and held them up, it felt like a heavy weight on her heart, feeling that she hadn't fulfilled her responsibility. She often asked herself: Can't you think of a way to bundle the plates and bowls securely so that customers don't have to worry? Nothing is impossible in the world if you put your heart into it, and Tang Sufen later really did research a way to bundle the plates and bowls securely. When bundling a stack of plates or bowls, she specifically made a "dead knot" on the bottom overlapping paper ropes, preventing the paper ropes from slipping to the side and causing the plates or bowls to break. From then on, the salespersons in this group were all confident in suggesting that customers carry the plates or bowls.
    Powerful Support
    The number of customers in front of the knitwear counter was even greater than in front of the fabric counter, but the salespersons seemed to work so easily. Salesperson Wang Zhanying picked up two connected towels, gently pulled them on a tool, and neatly cut them into two towels. Then, she folded and rolled them and handed them to the customer, who left satisfied. Selling a towel like this didn't even take a minute. Here, you no longer see the scene, like in other stores, of two salespersons pulling on the towels and laboriously cutting them with scissors. The salespersons who sell towels all thank this "towel cutting knife" for reducing their physical labor.
    Speaking of reducing the physical labor of the salespersons, some people may not feel it so deeply and may think that salespersons, especially those selling towels, couldn't possibly be that tired. But that's not the case. Salespersons sell one or two thousand towels every day—and the towels produced by the factory are all connected in pairs, requiring five or six hundred to a thousand cuts. Their fingers develop blisters, which eventually turn into calluses. More seriously, the slow cutting couldn't keep up with the sales, and customers had many complaints. Salesperson Yang Shuzhen had secretly shed tears many times because her hands were covered in blisters, and she couldn't satisfy the customers.
    Zhang Haixian, the head of the knitwear group, put a lot of effort into researching the "towel cutting knife." The first time, he wanted to make a tool like a guillotine to cut the two towels open at once, which would be fast and effortless. But when he made it and tested it, he found that because the towel was so soft, it couldn't be cut. The second time, he envisioned making a large pair of scissors with jaws as wide as the towel, so that he could cut it down in one go, saving him from having to "crunch" several times and wearing out his hands. But to make large scissors would require customization and would be too heavy. After two consecutive failures, Zhang Haixian didn't lose heart and finally, on the third try, ground a foot-long blade from a discarded saw blade, mounting the blade upwards on a piece of wood…and successfully researched the current "towel cutting knife." The physical labor of the salespersons selling towels has been greatly reduced compared to the past, and the number of staff has also been reduced by half.
    The Best Mediator
    Among the commodities sold in this store, items such as flashbulbs, woolen clothing, and various musical instruments need to be inspected and tested to determine their quality. In the past, due to the lack of inspection and testing tools, customers could not choose well, and often found problems or dissatisfaction after buying the items, and would return to request a refund or exchange. Also, because it was sometimes unclear who was responsible, customers and salespersons often argued. Now, the salespersons in this store have created vacuum bottle liner testers, woolen clothing testers, flashbulb testers, etc., greatly reducing the number of disputes between customers and salespersons, and the number of requests for refunds and exchanges.
    On the counter of the musical instrument group, there is a harmonica tester, which customers can use instead of their mouths to test and choose the most satisfying harmonica. It wasn't like this in the past. At first, customers were allowed to try blowing the harmonicas, but later some customers complained that this was unsanitary, and the salespersons also realized that harmonicas that had been tried by others often couldn't be sold in the end. Later, customers were not allowed to try blowing them, but the customers' opinions were even greater, all reflecting: "If we can't try blowing them, how can we know if they're good or bad?" So they often argued with the salespersons about this, and many salespersons were unwilling to sell harmonicas as a result.
    How can we satisfy the customers? Yang Qingyu, the head of the musical instrument group, pondered in his heart: If there was a tool that could replace the mouth, that would be great. Once, he went to the toy group and saw many children buying toy accordions, which would sound when pulled and pressed. He picked one up and saw that the sounding end was inlaid with a small harmonica. He pondered in his heart, couldn't a harmonica be tested like this? He went back and discussed it with the people in the group, who all said that this method could work. They bought a toy accordion, and inspired by this accordion, they finally successfully researched the "harmonica tester." Now, customers buying harmonicas have a new method to replace their own mouths to test and choose harmonicas. They are all satisfied to be able to buy a satisfying harmonica that no one has tried blowing.
    What has been described here are just a few of the branches of the technological innovation blossoms blooming in this store. According to Chen Hongyi, director of the manager's office, under the leadership and organization of the store's Party organization, the salespersons have created seventy-seven types of tools and reformed many operating methods. From selection, inspection, testing, and accounting to packaging, the sales work for most commodities has been innovated. (Pictures attached)

### 革新的花朵——在沈阳市百货公司第二商店所见所闻

    革新的花朵
    ——在沈阳市百货公司第二商店所见所闻
    本报记者　王殿学文　李福德摄影
    沈阳市百货公司第二商店，座落在沈阳市最繁华的中央大街，每天都接待三、四万名顾客。最近记者在这座大型的综合性商店里，看到听到许多技术革新的新事，有的提高了售货员的工作效率，有的减轻了售货员的体力劳动，有的改进了售货员的服务质量，有的密切了售货员和顾客之间的关系……
    聪明的助手
    入夏以来，在布匹组柜台前面，顾客们越聚越多。许多姑娘和带着小孩的妈妈在那里挤着挑选花布。售货员们在柜台里，忙着给这位顾客搬过一匹花布，又忙着给另一位顾客开交钱票。只见售货员看一眼“速算卡片”，没用半分钟的时间，就把售货票开好，交给顾客去交钱，又在接待第二个顾客了。售货员高淑芬告诉我，这种“速算卡片”是他们的有力助手，用过去接待一个顾客的时间，现在在它的帮助下，能接待两三位顾客。
    接着，她若有所思地讲起下面这个故事：他们这一组，去年增加四名新售货员，打起算盘来都很不熟练。有一次，一个顾客要买十六尺半蓝斜纹布，这种布是三角六分五厘钱一尺。新售货员洛英年用算盘打了五、六遍，还是拿不准对不对，不敢给顾客开交钱小票。顾客急得把算盘拿过去，自己算，自己开好交钱小票去交钱，小洛羞得几乎要哭出声来。那时，新来的售货员都不得不在胸前戴上“练习生”的名签，意思是请顾客们体谅。
    老售货员李萍看到这种情景，下定决心要帮助新售货员们照顾好顾客。开始，她替新售货员解释，有时替新售货员打算盘。可是她想这样下去，只能帮助一时，怎样才能根本解决问题呢？经过几天研究，她创造出这种“速算卡片”来。在卡片上面，写明布的价格，填上半尺、一尺、一尺半，一直到二十尺的金额，拴在每一种布上，用不上半分钟，就能算好账。现在，不仅是新售货员，就是一些老售货员，也大都不再用算盘，而用这种“速算卡片”了。
    捧着和提着
    在陶瓷器皿柜台前，我看到售货员唐素芳正在把一落六个瓷碗捆好，特意在底下重叠的几道纸绳上打一个“死结”。顾客接过这落碗，还怕她绑的不牢实，用一只手托着刚要走，唐素芳特意告诉他：“你可以提着走，保证绳脱不了。”一边说着，又接过这落碗来，提着前后用力甩了几次，让顾客相信她的话。另一个售货员告诉我：“在技术革新之前，我们可不敢打这种‘保票’，甚至怕捆扎的不牢实，还建议顾客捧着走。”
    售货员这么一说，使我连想起来在街上常常看到的一些人，小心翼翼地捧着几个碗回家去的情景。这个售货员接着又给我讲了个故事：有一次，一个顾客选好四个碟子、四个碗，让售货员替他捆好，提着走了。不到两三分钟，这位顾客又空着手转回，重新挑选起碟子碗来。售货员就问他：“您不是刚才买了碟子和碗了吗？”顾客恢谐地回答：“刚一下台阶就让我又‘卖’了。”这次，顾客一再叮嘱售货员，替他捆牢实一点。临走时，他还是不放心地紧紧地捧着碟子和碗。
    每逢顾客从唐素芳手里接过去碟子或碗捧起来，都像是在她的心坎上压上一块沉重的铅，觉得自己没有尽到责任。她常常责问自己：你就不能想个办法，把碟子碗捆扎得牢实，不让顾客提心吊胆么？天下无难事，就怕心不专，唐素芳后来真的就研究出来了把碟子碗捆牢实的办法。把一落碟子或碗捆扎好，在底上重叠的几道纸绳上，特意打一个“死结”，不让纸绳脱落到旁边去，把碟子或碗摔碎。从那以后，这个小组的售货员就都有把握建议顾客提着碟子或碗走了。
    有力的支援
    针织品柜台前的顾客，甚至比布匹组柜台前的顾客还多，可是售货员工作起来却显得那么轻松。售货员王占英拿起两条连着的毛巾，轻轻在一种工具上一拉，便整齐地割成两条，随后一叠一卷，交给顾客，顾客满意地走了。这样卖一条手巾，也没用上一分钟。在这里，再也看不到像别的商店那样，两个售货员拉着毛巾，用剪刀吃力地剪着的那种情景了。经营毛巾的售货员，都感谢这种“毛巾裁剪刀”减轻了她们的体力劳动。
    提起减轻售货员们的体力劳动，有些人也许体会不那么深，会以为售货员，特别是卖毛巾，还能怎么累呢？其实不然。售货员们每天卖出一两千条毛巾——工厂生产的毛巾又都是两条连在一起，要剪五、六百次到一千次，手指头都磨出了大泡，时间一长就磨成了老茧。更严重的是，剪的慢供不上卖，顾客们有很多意见。售货员杨淑珍就曾经因为手磨出血泡，又不能使顾客满意，暗地里掉过多次眼泪。
    针织品组长张海先，在研究“毛巾裁剪刀”时，曾经花费了很多心血。第一次，他想做一个像铡刀似的工具，一下子把两条毛巾切开，不仅快，还能省力气。等到做好一试验，因为毛巾特别软，反而切不动。第二次，他又设想做一把大剪子，剪子咀的长度，要有毛巾那么宽，也可以一下剪下来，省得多“嘎叽”几下磨坏手，但是要做大剪刀，一则需要订制，二则也太沉。接连两次失败，张海先都没有灰心，终于在第三次，用废锯条磨成一尺长的刀片，刀刃向上镶在一块木头上……研究成功现在的“毛巾裁剪刀”。经营毛巾的售货员体力劳动比过去大大减轻了，人员也比过去减少了一半。
    最好的调解者
    这个商店经营的商品中，像闪光灯泡、毛料服装和各种乐器等，都是要经过检查、试验才能知道质量好坏。在过去，因为缺少检查、试验的工具，顾客不能很好挑选，往往把东西买回去以后，才发现有毛病或不称意，回来要求退换；又因为一时弄不清责任该由谁负，顾客和售货员常常发生争吵。现在这个商店的售货员们创制出暖瓶胆检查器、毛料服装检查器、闪光灯泡检验器等等，顾客和售货员之间的争吵、要求退换商品的事情大大减少了。
    在乐器组的柜台上，摆着一个口琴试验器，买口琴的顾客可以用它代替嘴，试验挑选最称心的口琴。过去可不是这样。最先是卖口琴准许顾客用嘴试吹，后来有的顾客提意见，说这样不讲卫生，售货员也发觉别人试吹过的口琴，常常最后卖不出去。后来就不准顾客试吹了，可是顾客们的意见更大了，都反映：“不让试吹，可怎么知道好坏呢？”于是常常为此和售货员争吵起来，许多售货员因而不愿卖口琴。
    怎样才能让顾客满意呢？乐器组组长杨庆余心里琢磨：要是有一种工具，能够代替嘴，那就好了。有一次，他到玩具组去，看见有许多小孩子在买玩具手风琴拉，一拉一按都响，他拿起一个一看，响的一头，就是镶的一个小口琴。他在心里琢磨，口琴不也可以这样试验么？回头和组里人一商量，都说这个办法能成，他们就买了一个剔庄手风琴，在这个手风琴的启发下，他们终于研究成功了“口琴试验器”。现在，买口琴的顾客，已经有新办法来代替自己的嘴试验挑选口琴了，他们都为能买到没有人试吹过的称心的口琴而满意。
    这里所记述的，只是这个商店盛开着的技术革新花朵中的几枝。据经理办公室主任陈洪懿介绍，在商店党组织的领导和组织下，售货员们已经创造了七十七种工具，改革了许多操作方法，从挑选、检查、试验、算账到包装，大部分商品的售货工作都有革新。（附图片）
