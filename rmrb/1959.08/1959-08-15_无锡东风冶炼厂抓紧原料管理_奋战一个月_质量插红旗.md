Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 14th – Wuxi Dongfeng Smelter in Jiangsu Province has tightly grasped the crucial link of raw material management, ensuring that all raw materials undergo rigorous washing, screening, crushing, roasting, and testing before entering the furnace. After just one month of effort, the quality of pig iron has significantly improved. From mid-June to mid-July, the average合格率 [Ed: probably should read "生铁合格率" or "pig iron qualification rate"] reached 95.94%, with first-class products accounting for 71.85%; the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace remained at a level of 1.32.

This factory started production in March of this year, with two small thirteen-cubic-meter blast furnaces. Initially, the quality and output of iron were not high; in April, the pig iron合格率 [Ed: probably should read "生铁合格率" or "pig iron qualification rate"] was only about 40%. In late May, the factory leaders analyzed the reasons for the poor quality. They believed that they had previously focused on furnace operation while neglecting raw material management. For example, ore was not roasted, the particle size of the raw materials was uneven, and the ore was mixed with ore powder and waste rock. These were all unfavorable factors affecting the quality of pig iron. In response to the above situation, the Party branch mobilized the workers to focus on raw material management, strengthening the rational stacking, roasting, screening, and testing of raw materials to ensure that the blast furnace was fed with fine grains, achieving the four requirements of "fine," "even," "clean," and "hot."

The entire factory's workers made serious efforts to strengthen raw material management. The workers in the stockyard put forward the slogan "Managing materials is like managing grain." They used old bricks to pave the site and old materials to build material sheds to prevent the raw materials from getting muddy or rained on. They also stored the materials in separate piles according to different specifications, with wooden signs inserted in each pile for easy identification during use. After the ore was transported to the factory, it was first selected to remove waste rock and improve the grade rate of the ore. Then, it was crushed and divided into two grades, fifteen to thirty-five millimeters and eight to fifteen millimeters, to make the ore particle size uniform. Finally, the ore was washed with water to remove mud and sand and reduce the sulfur content in the ore.

The entire factory built eight ore roasting furnaces, using the gas from the small blast furnaces to ensure that all the ore was roasted twice before entering the furnace. After roasting, the sulfur content of the ore was greatly reduced. This not only directly benefited the improvement of pig iron quality but also enabled the small blast furnace to eat "hot grain," accelerating ore reduction and facilitating increased production.

In order to base raw material management work on a scientific foundation, the factory strengthened testing work, especially focusing on the testing and analysis of coke and slag. They expanded the coke shed to ensure that the factory always had sufficient coke reserves. All coke entering the factory was tested, and no coke was allowed to enter the furnace without testing. By mastering the coke composition, they could actively and correctly batch the materials. The factory also stipulated that ore, solvents, and other materials were not allowed to enter the furnace without testing. Pig iron was also tested furnace by furnace, and furnace temperature analysis was performed every shift to understand the changes in blast furnace smelting conditions in a timely manner. Strict testing work not only ensured the quality of pig iron but also played a supervisory and guiding role in the operation of small blast furnaces.

In order to do a good job in raw material management, the factory also stipulated a system of mutual supervision between the preceding and following processes. For example, if the particle size of ore or coke was uneven, the weighing workers had the right to refuse acceptance; if the ore was not washed clean or picked clean, the workers in the roasting furnace had the right to refuse and return it for re-washing and re-picking, and so on. The quality and output of pig iron were announced to the masses every day.

While strengthening raw material management, the factory also worked hard to improve furnace operation. They seriously studied the effective experiences of small blast furnaces in various places. For example, they insisted on implementing experiences such as using quicklime instead of limestone, "high-blast, high-temperature operation," "multi-nozzle combustion," and making alkaline slag, all in conjunction with the specific conditions of the factory.

In the struggle to improve the quality of pig iron, the Dongfeng Smelter focused on ideological education. The Party branch once organized all the factory's workers to discuss questions such as "Can high output be achieved with high quality?" and "How to achieve high quality and high output?" They criticized ideological sentiments such as "This factory is a new furnace and new people, and it is difficult to achieve high quality and high output for a while" and "Improving quality should be done slowly," making improving quality a conscious action of the majority of workers.

Since July, the average utilization coefficient of No. 1 blast furnace in Wuxi Smelter has reached above 1.4, and the highest utilization coefficient is 2.01. The合格率 [Ed: probably should read "生铁合格率" or "pig iron qualification rate"] of pig iron has reached 96.5%. The picture shows the No. 1 small blast furnace tapping iron.

    无锡东风冶炼厂抓紧原料管理
    奋战一个月　质量插红旗
    本报南京14日电　江苏省无锡东风冶炼厂紧紧抓住原料管理这一环，使一切原料在入炉前都经过严格的洗选、破碎、焙烧和化验，经过短短一个月的努力，生铁质量显著提高。从6月中旬到7月中旬止，生铁合格率平均达到95.94％，其中一级品率占71.85％；高炉利用系数保持在一点三二的水平。
    这个厂从今年3月中旬开始生产，共有两座十三立方米的小高炉。最初铁的质量、产量都不高，4月份生铁合格率只有40％左右。5月下旬，工厂领导干部分析了质量差的原因。他们认为，过去重视了炉前操作，却忽视了原料管理，如矿石没有经过焙烧，原料粒度大小不匀，矿石中混有矿粉和废石等，这都是影响生铁质量的不利因素。针对以上情况，党支部发动职工狠抓原料管理，加强原料合理堆放、焙烧、筛选、化验等工作，保证高炉吃细粮，达到“细”、“匀”、“净”、“热”四个要求。
    全厂工人围绕加强原料管理作了认真的努力。料场工人提出了“管料如管粮”的口号，用旧砖铺场地，用旧料搭料棚，不使原料沾泥淋雨，并按原料不同规格，分堆存放，每堆原料都插木牌做标记，用料时能一目了然。矿石运到工厂以后，先经过拣选，去掉废石，提高矿石的品位率；然后经过破碎，分成十五到三十五米厘及八到十五米厘大小两级，使矿石粒度均匀；最后还用水冲洗矿石，去除泥砂，降低矿石中的含硫量。
    全厂建了八座矿石焙烧炉，利用小高炉的煤气，使矿石在入炉前全部经过两次焙烧。矿石经过焙烧，含硫量大大降低。这不但对提高生铁质量有直接好处，还使小高炉能吃“热粮”，加速矿石还原，有利于提高产量。
    为了使原料管理工作建立在科学基础上，这个厂加强了化验工作，特别是抓紧了焦炭和炉渣的化验分析工作。他们扩建了焦炭棚，使厂内经常保持有足够的存焦。所有进厂的焦炭都经过化验，未经化验，不准入炉。由于掌握了焦炭成分，便能主动地正确地配料。这个厂还规定，矿石溶剂等未经化验，也不准入炉。生铁也做到炉炉化验，并且每班进行一次炉温分析，及时了解高炉冶炼情况的变化。严格的化验工作，不但保证了生铁的质量，而且对小高炉的操作起了监督和指导的作用。
    为了搞好原料管理工作，这个厂还规定了前后工序互相监督的制度。如矿石、焦炭粒度大小不均匀，磅秤工有权拒收；矿石洗得不清，拣得不净，焙烧炉的职工有权拒绝，退回重洗再拣，等等。每天生铁的质量和产量，都向群众公布。
    在加强原料管理的同时，这个厂也努力改进了炉前操作。他们认真学习各地小高炉行之有效的经验。如用生石灰代替石灰石、“大风高温操作”、“多嘴燃烧”、造碱性渣等经验，他们都结合本厂具体情况坚持实行。
    东风冶炼厂在提高生铁质量的斗争中，抓紧进行了思想教育工作。党支部曾经组织全厂职工讨论了“高产能不能优质？”“怎样优质高产？”等问题，批判了“本厂是新炉新人，一时难以优质高产”、“提高质量要慢慢来”等思想情绪，使提高质量成为广大职工自觉的行动。（附图片）
