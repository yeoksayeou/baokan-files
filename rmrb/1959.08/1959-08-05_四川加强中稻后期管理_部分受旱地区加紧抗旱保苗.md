　　Sichuan Strengthens Late-Stage Management of Mid-Season Rice
　　Some Drought-Affected Areas Intensify Drought Resistance to Protect Seedlings
　　(Our newspaper's report from Chengdu, August 4th) Sichuan Province is seizing the crucial period of jointing and booting of mid-season rice, adopting effective measures to strengthen late-stage field management, promoting long ears, large ears, many grains, and plump grains of mid-season rice, striving for even greater harvests.
　　The 40 million mu of mid-season rice in Sichuan Province is the main grain crop of the entire year. In order to strive for more planting and more harvesting, this year the province expanded mid-season rice by more than 7 million mu compared to last year, and the quality and specifications of transplanting were also better than in previous years. Since mid-July, most of the mid-season rice in the province has successively entered the jointing and booting stage, requiring strengthened late-stage management and the supply of sufficient nutrition. Now, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep to lead the masses in launching a vigorous upsurge in late-stage management of mid-season rice.
　　In order to further boost morale and eliminate the complacency and slackness that has grown among some cadres and the masses, many places have first strengthened political and ideological work. In response to complacent arguments such as "a bumper harvest is already set, so we can relax," they have checked seedlings to find gaps and calculated increased production based on the analysis of the nutritional needs of rice at different stages of growth, explaining that there is great potential for increasing mid-season rice production.
　　In management, all localities have focused on topdressing, vigorously applying booting fertilizer and grain-filling fertilizer to attack the ears and grains. In order not to miss the timing, many areas have launched large-scale crash programs to accumulate, create, and apply fertilizer. Some early rice main producing areas have also allocated a certain amount of labor for field management of mid-season rice.
　　Since July, some areas of Sichuan have experienced drought. These areas have launched field management movements centered on drought resistance and seedling protection, rescuing drought-stricken rice fields, and conducting topdressing and irrigation. In Nanchong County, 180,000 mu of rice fields were cut off from water due to the drought. The entire county immediately organized 350,000 people to fight the drought, and the vast majority of rice fields were topdressed in conjunction with drought resistance. After drought resistance efforts in many areas of Fuling, Wanxian, Nanchong and other regions, the drought situation has been alleviated. Various localities have also adopted many measures to prevent lodging of mid-season rice, drawing on the experience of late-stage management of wheat and early rice. (Yu Jingqi)

### 四川加强中稻后期管理  部分受旱地区加紧抗旱保苗

    四川加强中稻后期管理
    部分受旱地区加紧抗旱保苗
    本报成都4日电　四川省各地抓住中稻拔节孕穗的关键时期，采取有效措施加强田间后期管理，促使中稻穗长、穗大、粒多、粒饱，夺取更大丰收。
    四川省四千万亩中稻是全年的主要粮食作物。为了争取多种多收，今年全省中稻比去年扩大了七百多万亩，栽插质量规格也较往年好。7月中旬以来，全省大部中稻都先后进入了拔节孕穗时期，需要加强后期管理，供给充分营养。现在各级党委负责人都深入领导群众掀起了热火朝天的中稻后期管理热潮。
    为了进一步鼓足干劲，消除部分干部和群众中滋长的松劲自满情绪，许多地方首先加强了政治思想工作。针对“丰收已定、可以放心”等自满论调，以查苗找漏洞和根据水稻生长不同阶段营养需要的分析算增产账，说明中稻增产大有可为。
    各地在管理中都以追肥为中心，大力追施孕穗肥和长粒肥（灌浆肥）、攻穗攻粒。为了不错过时期，许多地区都开展了大规模的突击积肥、造肥、施肥运动，一些早稻主产区也分出了一定的劳力进行中稻的田间管理。
    7月份以来，四川部分地区发生干旱，这些地区大都以抗旱保苗为中心展开田间管理运动，抢救受旱稻田，进行追肥灌水。南充县在干旱中十八万亩稻田断水，全县立刻组织三十五万人抗旱，绝大部分稻田结合抗旱施了追肥。涪陵、万县、南充等专区不少地区经过抗旱后，旱象已解除。各地还接受小麦、早稻后期管理经验，采取许多措施防止中稻倒伏。　（于竞祁）
