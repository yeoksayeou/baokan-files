　　Chengdu, August 10th (by our reporter) - In Luxian County, Sichuan Province, the Lailong Commune has three adjacent production teams. Although the soil, water conservancy, planting density, and fertilization conditions were roughly the same in the early rice production, the actual results differed greatly due to the different levels of disaster prevention and resistance efforts. This proves that more struggle leads to more harvest.
　　The Satellite Production Team of this commune, in conjunction with the reform of cultivation techniques, implemented the spirit of "grasping tightly from the beginning and throughout" in dealing with the issue of "fighting for grain with nature." They overcame various natural disasters, ensuring that the average yield of early rice for the entire team reached 665 jin per mu, an increase of 66% compared to last year. The Star Production Team once relaxed its struggle against disasters, resulting in some losses. However, they learned from their mistakes in the later stages, and the early rice yield per mu for the entire team still increased by 15% compared to last year, averaging 570 jin. The Leap Forward Production Team, on the other hand, failed to grasp the struggle against natural disasters from beginning to end, resulting in a reduction of several thousand jin of grain from more than 100 mu of early rice due to disasters. The yield per unit area even decreased slightly compared to last year, averaging 430 jin per mu.
　　The different approaches of these three teams to disaster prevention were due to their different views. The Leap Forward Production Team believed that "planting crops depends half on effort and half on luck." They had a serious reliance on the weather and relaxed their struggle against natural disasters. The Star Production Team originally believed that as long as the crops were well-managed and some major disasters were overcome, a good harvest could be ensured, and minor disasters would not result in much loss of grain. The Satellite Production Team believed that planting crops required "both reform and prevention." Without reforming cultivation techniques, it would be difficult to increase production, and without preventing disasters, it would be like "using a leaky jar to hold water; adding a ladle only to lose a bowl," ultimately not increasing the amount of grain much. Therefore, they adopted a series of disaster prevention and resistance measures from early rice seedling cultivation, emergence, seedling field management, transplanting to field management. At the same time, they believed that frequently recurring disaster phenomena such as the early spring cold waves, the continuous rain during the flowering period, the strong winds in the mountainous areas, and the susceptibility to insect infestation after the seedling stalks are grouted could be overcome by taking measures to tightly grasp each link.

### 在天灾面前应该怎么办？　请看来龙公社三个队生产情况的对比

　　在天灾面前应该怎么办？
　　请看来龙公社三个队生产情况的对比
    本报成都10日电　四川泸县来龙公社有三个相邻的生产队，在早稻生产中虽然土壤水利、密植程度、施肥状况等大体相同，但由于防灾抗灾功夫深浅不同，实收结果相差很远。这证明了多一次斗争就多一分收成。
    这个公社的卫星生产队结合改革耕作技术，在对待“与天争粮”的问题上贯彻了“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的精神，战胜了各种自然灾害，保证全队早稻平均亩产六百六十五斤，比去年增产66％。明星生产队曾一度放松与灾害斗争，因而受了一些损失，但后期及时接受教训，全队早稻每亩仍然比去年增长15％，平均达到五百七十斤。跃进生产队则由于始终没有抓紧防御自然灾害的斗争，一百多亩早稻因灾少收好几千斤粮食，单位面积产量还比去年降低了一点，平均亩产四百三十斤。
    这三个队对防御灾害的不同做法，是由于他们有不同的看法。跃进生产队认为“种庄稼一半靠工夫，一半靠运气”，他们靠天吃饭思想严重，放松了对自然灾害的斗争。明星生产队原来的看法是：只要庄稼做得好和战胜一些主要灾害就能保丰收，轻微的灾害损失不了多少粮食。卫星生产队则认为种庄稼需要“又改又防”；不改革耕作技术就很难增产，不防御灾害好比“破缸盛水，添一瓢，漏一碗”，到头来增加不了多少粮食。因此他们从早稻育秧、出苗、秧田管理、插秧到田间管理等采取了一系列的防灾抗灾的措施。同时他们认为像本地早春的寒潮、扬花期中的霪雨、山地风大、苗架灌浆后容易生虫等都是经常重复出现的灾害现象，完全可以采取措施环环抓紧，加以克服。
