Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th - According to reports in newspapers in the Berlin Democratic Sector: The West German government is deliberately disrupting the 7th World Youth and Student Festival being held in Vienna. Some secret service agencies and revanchist organizations in West Berlin have dispatched large numbers of secret agents to Vienna under the guise of "special leave" to carry out sabotage activities.

Personnel from the "Free German Brotherhood," which has close ties with American intelligence agencies, and the "All-German Student and University Group," which receives subsidies from the Bonn secret service agency, the Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs, have been ordered to go to Vienna.

The Christian Democratic Union and the Federation of German Industries have allocated one million West German Marks to fund the sabotage of the World Youth Festival. The Christian Democratic Union's youth organization has organized a 5,000-strong "observation group" carrying large sums of money to Vienna. It is reported that these secret agents are attempting to force, lure, and buy off young people from various countries to "stay in the free world" through methods of "increasing contact."
