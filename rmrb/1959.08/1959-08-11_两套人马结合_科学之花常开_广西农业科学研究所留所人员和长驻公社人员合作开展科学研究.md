Nanning, August 10th (Reported by this newspaper) – The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Agricultural Science Institute is adopting a method of combining efforts from above and below to carry out scientific research, greatly enriching the achievements of scientific research. They are divided into two teams, one stationed in the people's communes to systematically record and summarize the production experience of the masses of farmers, and the other in their own experimental fields to conduct scientific evaluations of various experiments.

In the past six months, the six departments of the Agricultural Science Institute have used this method to conduct research on twenty-three major and thirty-nine minor scientific topics. These include high-yield cultivation and breeding of improved varieties of food crops, high-yield cultivation, comprehensive technical research, and breeding of improved varieties of economic crops such as oilseeds, fibers, and sugarcane, high-yield research on fruit trees, and rapid fruit tree seedling cultivation. Some topics have begun to find solutions, while others are still being tested. In terms of food crops, according to the scientific issues raised by the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture," a lot of valuable research data has been collected and recorded, such as the issue of rational close planting of rice. Comparative experiments with different planting densities were conducted on five rice varieties, and preliminary results have been obtained. In terms of fertilizers, past observations of soil-based methods of manufacturing potassium silicate and field fertilizer efficiency experiments have proven that potassium silicate manufactured using weathered quartz powder, alkaline sand, and coal powder can strengthen the stems and leaves and surface cell tissue of rice, enhancing the resistance of rice to lodging and rice blast. Moreover, the raw materials for manufacturing are low in cost and the manufacturing method is simple, so it is planned to be vigorously promoted. Furthermore, in the past, the prevention and treatment of rice blast mostly adopted organic mercury agents such as Ceresan or Semesan, which require mercury raw materials and are costly. Through control experiments of five rice varieties with rice blast using lime-sulfur mixture, the Agricultural Science Institute has fully confirmed that this low-cost agent is not only convenient to apply, but also has the same effect in preventing and controlling rice blast as Ceresan and Semesan, and has strong adhesion.

As early as January of this year, the Agricultural Science Institute dispatched thirty-nine technicians, technical staff, and technical assistants to form research teams on rice, coarse grains, economic crops, sugarcane, vegetables, and fruit trees, respectively, and sent them to ten communes in six counties and cities to reside in production teams year-round, learn from the masses of farmers, observe, understand, record, and summarize the production experience of the masses, and at the same time promote agricultural scientific knowledge to farmers. For example, the rice research team stationed in the Qunying Commune of Xiasi, Ningming County, led the masses to carry out experimental fields. Production teams in Baima Brigade alone conducted experiments on more than one hundred and forty research topics, including varieties, deep plowing, shallow plowing, irrigation and drainage, fertilization, and hybridization. The various professional research teams stationed in the communes mainly carry out scientific research activities around the current central work. For example, scientific personnel of the vegetable research team stationed in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune in the suburbs of Nanning City spend twenty days a month participating in labor. Focusing on the current problems of developing vegetable production, they vigorously carry out research activities such as vegetable cultivation, seed selection, and experience summarization.

The team staying at the institute, in addition to being responsible for the research and evaluation work of the institute, in accordance with the research information from the resident staff and the problems occurring in various places, cooperates with the Agricultural Department and agricultural colleges to form professional work teams to conduct inspections and assist in research activities. For example, when the team in Shangshi Commune, Ningming County, discovered "citrus fruit fly," the institute studied, sorted out, and summarized their preliminary research findings. Then, according to the identification by the Institute of Entomology of China, they guided them to expand the scope of research from the commune to the entire county for further research. The resident research team made specimens of "citrus fruit fly" and distributed them to counties where "large fruit fly" had been found in the past, so that each region could distinguish them and clarify the distribution of "citrus fruit fly." At the same time, under the leadership of the Science and Technology Commission of the Autonomous Region, the institute, together with the Agricultural Department and agricultural colleges, formed a fruit tree investigation team to conduct a survey of fruit tree varieties in the region to further ascertain the distribution and living habits of "citrus fruit fly" in Guangxi.

Because of the close combination of efforts from above and below, this research work is advancing victoriously. In order to closely connect the two teams from above and below, the institute also stipulates that the resident research institute report the investigation and research situation to the institute once every half month, and comprehensively summarize the work once every season, so that the institute can arrange and carry out scientific research and scientific evaluation work in the institute based on the preliminary results of the investigation and research below. At the same time, the responsible comrades of the institute, according to the activities of the resident research team and the work of the institute every quarter, form an inspection team to go to the relevant communes to conduct inspections and solve problems, and cooperate to conduct research on relevant issues. Because agricultural science and technology personnel often go deep into practice, deep into the masses, and forget to eat and sleep to explore scientific secrets, they not only broaden their horizons, but also transform their thinking. Some scientific topics that are not recorded in books and have not been solved have been solved among the masses. For example, the layering propagation method of longan and lychee, which agricultural technicians have never believed would succeed, has now been found to have been successful among the masses of farmers in the past.

### 两套人马结合　科学之花常开　广西农业科学研究所留所人员和长驻公社人员合作开展科学研究

　　两套人马结合　科学之花常开
　　广西农业科学研究所留所人员和长驻公社人员合作开展科学研究
    本报南宁10日电　广西僮族自治区农业科学研究所，采取上下结合的办法开展科学研究，大大丰富了科学研究的成果。他们分成两套人马，一套长驻在人民公社，系统地记录总结农民群众的生产经验；一套在自己试验场里对各种试验进行科学鉴定。
    半年来，农业科学研究所所属的六个系，采用这种方法，进行了二十三项大小三十九个科学课题的研究。其中有粮食作物丰产栽培和良种选育，油料、纤维、甘蔗等经济作物的丰产栽培、技术综合研究和优良品种选育，果树丰产研究和果树快速育苗等课题。有些课题已开始找到解决的途径，有些则正在继续试验中。在粮食作物方面，根据“八字宪法”提出的科学问题，搜集、记录了许多有价值的研究资料，如水稻合理密植问题，对五个水稻品种进行了不同密植幅度的对比实验，并已取得了初步结果。肥料方面，过去土法制造矽酸钾及田间肥效实验的观察证明：采用风化石英粉；碱沙、煤粉土法制造的矽酸钾，能加强水稻茎叶及表层细胞组织，增强水稻对倒伏和稻瘟病的抵抗力。而且制造原料成本低，制造方法简便。准备大力推广。再如过去防治稻瘟病大多采焙赛力散或西力生两种有机汞剂，这种药剂需要水银原料，成本高。农业科学研究所通过用石灰硫磺剂对有稻瘟病的五种水稻防治试验，完全证实这种成本低的药剂不但施用方便，而且在防治稻瘟效果和赛力散和西力生两种有机汞剂一样，同时粘着力强。
    农业科学研究所早在今年1月份就派出了三十九名技师、技术员、技术助理员，组成了水稻、杂粮、经济作物、甘蔗、蔬菜、果树等研究工作组，分别深入到六个县、市的十个公社里去，长年驻在生产队里，向农民群众学习，并观察、了解记录与总结群众的生产经验，同时向农民宣传农业科学知识。如驻在宁明夏石群英公社的水稻研究工作组，带动群众搞试验田，仅白马大队的生产队就进行了品种、深耕、浅耕、排灌、施肥、杂交等一百四十多个研究题目的实验。长驻公社的各个专业研究工作组，主要是围绕当前中心工作，开展科学研究活动。如驻南宁市郊区中苏友好公社的蔬菜研究组的科学人员，每月以二十天的时间参加劳动。围绕当前发展蔬菜生产问题，大力开展蔬菜的栽培、选种、总结经验等研究活动。
    留在所里的一套人马，除负责所里的研究鉴定工作外，根据驻社人员研究情报及各地发生的问题，随时配合农业厅、农业院校组成专业工作队，进行检查，协助进行研究活动。例如，当宁明上石公社的小组发现“柑实蝇”后，所里便将他们的初步发现研究的总结进行研究整理，然后根据中国昆虫研究所的鉴定，指导他们把研究范围由公社扩大到全县，进一步做研究，驻社研究组将“柑实蝇”制成标本，分发到过去曾发现有“大实蝇”的各县，便于各地区别及查清“柑实蝇”分布情况。同时，所内在自治区科学委员会领导下与农业厅、农学院校共同组成果树调查队结合对全区果树品种调查，进一步摸清“柑实蝇”在广西分布情况及生活习性等。
    由于上下紧密结合，使这项研究工作胜利前进。为了密切上下两套人马的联系，所里还规定每半月驻社研究所向所里汇报一次调查研究情况，每一季节返所全面总结一次工作，便于所内根据下边调查、研究的初步成果，进行布置和开展所内科学研究及科学鉴定工作。同时所里负责同志根据每一季度驻社研究组活动情况及所里工作的情况，组成检查组下到有关公社，进行检查解决问题，并对有关问题协作起来进行研究。由于农业科学技术人员经常深入实际、深入群众、废寝忘食地探索科学秘密，不仅扩大了眼界，也改造了他们的思想。有些书本没有记载和没有解决的科学课题，却在群众中解决了，如龙眼、荔枝的秆插繁植法，过去农业技师一向都不相信会成功的，现在却发现在农民群众中过去早已获得成功。
