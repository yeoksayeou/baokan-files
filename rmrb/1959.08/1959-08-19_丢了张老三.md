　　Lost Zhang Laosan
　　Xu Tianbai

　　In the dead of night, after watering the cornfield, a commune member returned to the village, but Zhang Laosan was missing. Zhang San's wife was frantic, searching everywhere, "That silly old man, why doesn't he come back?" Suddenly, she saw Zhang Laohan squatting by a small bank, intently listening, what was he up to? "You old man, you're so annoying, aren't you tired? Why aren't you asleep!" "Please don't be noisy, squat beside me, listen to the corn stalks, they're creaking and groaning. Just watered them, they're already showing results, come and see tomorrow morning, I guarantee they'll have grown half an inch." The two laughed knowingly, chuckling loudly, startling the birds on the bank, which spread their wings and flew into the sky.

　　丢了张老三
　　许天柏半夜三更天，浇完玉米田，社员回村走，丢了张老三。急坏张三嫂，到处寻不见，“这个傻老头，为啥不回还？”忽见小岸头，蹲着张老汉，侧耳凝神听，弄的啥机关？“你这老头儿，叫人不耐烦，难道不嫌累，还不去安眠！”“请你先别吵，蹲在我身边，听听玉米棵，吱吱直叫唤。方才浇了水，马上见效验，天明再来瞧，保险长寸半。”两人会心笑，咯咯响声喧，惊起岸头鸟，展翅飞上天。
