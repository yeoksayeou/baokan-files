Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th: Sichuan Province is vigorously developing small-scale paper-making industry. At present, the province has built 114 small paper machines. From Youyang, Qianjiang, and Pengshui in eastern Sichuan to Ganzi and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures in northwestern Sichuan, paper machines are now in production. The small-scale paper-making industry in Neijiang and Mianyang prefectures has developed even faster, with more than ten small paper mills in each district. Sugar factories in Neijiang are also making great efforts in comprehensive utilization, building paper-making auxiliary workshops to bring paper-making enterprises closer to raw material producing areas.

Starting in September of last year, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Light Industry sent working groups to various localities to experiment with establishing small paper mills simply and according to local conditions, gaining experience to promote throughout the province. In February of this year, the Provincial Department of Light Industry Design Institute, Pulp and Paper Research Laboratory, Chemical Engineering School, and other units dispatched a group of technicians to seven prefectures to summarize and promote the experience of organizing normal production. At the same time, they organized "mobile medical teams" to help paper mills with abnormal production overcome technical barriers, and after production became relatively normal, they carried out the "four fixings" work of fixing output, fixing variety, fixing cost, and fixing system, so that output gradually increased and stabilized.

In order to produce more paper, paper mills in various places have paid attention to saving raw materials. Paper mills in Xinjin, Chongqing, Jiajiang, Santai and other places have adopted methods such as lime cooking and raw material fermentation pulping to save alkali. In terms of pulping tools, many areas have also used flat grinding for pulping and bamboo curtains instead of copper mesh, simply solving the equipment problems of pulp production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: Henan Province, which relied entirely on supplies of various machine-made papers from other places a year ago, has now built small paper mills in seventy-four counties and cities, with a total of 147 paper machines put into production and under trial production. The printing paper, glazed paper, wrapping paper and other papers produced by these paper machines have been supplied to local printing industries, factories and general cultural departments.

The raw materials used by the paper mills are all local wheat straw, rice straw and other wild plants, and lime and wood ash water are used to replace some chemical raw materials.

### 四川建成一百多台小型造纸机  河南小纸厂遍及七十四个县市

　　四川建成一百多台小型造纸机
　  河南小纸厂遍及七十四个县市
    新华社成都18日电　四川省大力发展小型造纸工业。目前，全省已经建成一百一十四台小型造纸机。从川东的酉阳、黔江、彭水到川西北的甘孜、阿坝藏族自治州，都有了纸机生产；内江、绵阳等专区的小型造纸工业发展的更快，每区已有十多个小型造纸厂。内江各糖厂也大搞综合利用，建设了造纸附属车间，使造纸企业更接近原料产区。
    从去年9月间开始，四川省轻工业厅就派出工作组配合各地因陋就简、因地制宜地试办了一些小型纸厂，取得经验，在全省推广。今年2月间，省轻工业厅设计院、制浆造纸研究室、化工学校等单位又抽调了一批技术人员，分别到七个专区总结推广组织正常生产的经验。同时，组织“巡回医疗队”，帮助生产不正常的纸厂突破技术关，并且在生产比较正常以后，进行了定产量、定品种、定成本、定制度的“四定”工作，使产量得到逐步提高和稳定。
    各地纸厂为了生产出更多的纸张，都注意了节约原料。新津、崇庆、夹江、三台等地的纸厂都采用石灰蒸煮和生料发酵制浆等办法，来节约用碱。在制浆工具上，不少地区还用了平磨磨浆，用竹帘代替铜网，因陋就简地解决纸浆生产的器材问题。
    据新华社郑州18日电　一年以前各种机制纸全部依靠外地供应的河南省，现在已经有七十四个县、市建成了小型造纸厂，投入生产和正在试车生产的纸机共有一百四十七台。这些投入生产的纸机，生产出的印刷纸、有光纸、包装纸和其他纸张，已经先后供应当地印刷工业、工厂和一般文化部门使用。
    各纸厂生产用的原料，都是当地的麦秸、稻草和其他野生植物，并且用石灰、草木灰水代替了一部分化工原料。
