Looking at Prospects from the First Half of the Year
　　Cheng Guangrui

    Riding the east wind, the horse gallops swiftly! In the first half of 1959, the socialist camp rapidly traversed a new stage on the road of peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries.

    1958 was a year of rapid development for all countries in the socialist camp. The total industrial output of the entire socialist camp increased fourfold compared to 1937, accounting for more than one-third of the world's total industrial output. Based on this tremendous achievement, many countries have proposed new long-term plans to accelerate the development of their national economies. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formulated a seven-year plan, initiating a new period of comprehensive communist construction. The plan stipulates that by 1965, the total industrial output value will increase by 80%, and the total agricultural output value will increase by 70%. The seven-year plan formulated by the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party stipulates that by 1965, industrial production will increase by 80% and agricultural products will increase by 30%. Bulgaria's plan for accelerating the development of the national economy stipulates that industrial production will approximately double from 1957 by 1962, and approximately increase by two to three times from 1957 by 1965. Other countries are also accelerating their three-year or five-year plans. The splendid prospects displayed by the socialist countries' plans to accelerate the construction of socialism and communism have greatly inspired the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the working people of these countries.

    Achievements in Production

    The first half of 1959 was an extraordinary half-year, a half-year in which socialist countries achieved great victories on the front lines of communist and socialist construction.

    Please see the good news of the socialist countries' working people completing their production plans for the first half of this year ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas! In terms of industrial production: Compared with the first half of last year, the Soviet Union increased by 12%, Albania increased by 26.1%, Bulgaria increased by 23.4%, Hungary increased by approximately 9%, Vietnamese state-owned industrial production increased by 62.3%, the German Democratic Republic's industrial production increased by 12.4%, North Korea increased by 75% and completed the industrial gross output value target of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, Mongolia increased by 8.3%, Poland increased by 9.3%, Romania's heavy industrial production increased by 20.5%, consumer goods industry increased by 10.3%, Czechoslovakia's industrial production increased by 11%. -- These are not just ordinary numbers, these are inspiring, glorious poems of socialism!

    Many socialist countries celebrated harvests in the first half of 1959. The Soviet people are currently striving for the first great harvest of the seven-year plan. Vietnam's early rice has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with yields exceeding the best early rice harvest of 1956. North Korea's summer crops, such as wheat, have also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and other countries are also expected to have good harvests.

    In terms of livestock production, great development was also achieved in the first half of this year. The Soviet Union completed 135% of its meat procurement plan; compared with the first half of last year, the number of cattle in collective farms and state-owned farms increased by 7.1 million, pigs increased by 6.3 million, and sheep increased by 7.5 million. Mongolia's five types of livestock produced 500,000 more young animals than last year. North Korea's pigs increased by 34%, and Poland's livestock numbers increased by 200,000.

    The continuous expansion of production in socialist countries has guaranteed the continuous improvement of people's living standards. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union produced an additional 144 million square meters of textiles for its people and built housing with a total area of 13.6 million square meters. The Soviet Union, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia have all lowered prices. North Korea's monetary wages for workers and staff increased by 43% compared to the same period last year, and Hungary's residents' income increased by 8%.

    Ideological Harvests

    In the past six months, socialist countries have not only achieved great victories on the production front but have also reaped great gains on the ideological front. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union comprehensively launched communist education. Based on the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a series of important measures to further strengthen ideological work, educate, and cultivate new communist people. The movement to establish "Communist Labor Brigades" in the Soviet Union and "Socialist Labor Brigades" in other socialist countries is sweeping across the land. The Soviet working people have put forward the slogan of "working, studying, and living in the communist way." Many socialist countries' cadres participate in physical labor, writers get close to the people, and schools connect with life. In the Soviet Union, working people in various places have also established mass organizations such as people's inspection teams, comrade trial sessions, and street committees. The broad masses of the people actively and enthusiastically participate in social and political life, reflecting the continuous improvement of their ideological awareness. The ideological harvest of the people in socialist countries is an important guarantee for the victory of these countries on the production front.

    Major Measures

    The achievement of these tremendous achievements is not accidental. In the past six months, the parties and governments of socialist countries have taken a series of major measures in the economic field. In the first half of this year, the Soviet Union fully utilized the initiative of enterprises, strengthened the work of the state planning committees of the central government and various union republics, and strengthened the links and cooperation between various economic regions. Therefore, in the first half of this year, all union republics and national economic committees overfulfilled their production plans. Other socialist countries have also taken many measures to adjust production relations and promote the development of productive forces. For example, Poland continues to pay attention to the coordinated development of various industrial sectors, eliminating the imbalance in the development of light and heavy industries, while also paying attention to the rational allocation of productive forces. Bulgaria reorganized the national and economic leadership institutions and established new administrative and economic regions. The German Democratic Republic implemented socialist reconstruction and rationally organized production. In addition, the parties of various countries have strengthened their leadership over production, strengthened political and ideological work in socialist competitions, and played a major role in inspiring the enthusiasm of the working people.

    In agricultural production, many countries have adopted measures such as deep plowing and close planting, applying more fertilizer, selecting good seeds, strengthening field management, and building large-scale water conservancy projects, which have guaranteed the bumper harvest of crops and the further development of agriculture.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that in the first half of this year, the parties of many countries made great efforts in the socialist transformation of agriculture, which enabled the agricultural cooperativization movement in these countries to develop rapidly. This spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary has increased by more than 1,000 compared to the end of last year, and the proportion of its cultivated land area in the total cultivated land area of the country has increased from 15.6% last year to 36.1% now. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in Vietnam has increased from more than 5,000 last year to more than 16,000 now, and the proportion of farmers participating in cooperatives in the total number of farmers in the country has also increased from 4.2% last year to 21.5% now. As of April 1, the proportion of farmers participating in collective farms and mutual aid teams in Romania in the total number of farmers in the country had increased from 42% in 1957 to 62.3%. Last November, only 56% of herdsmen in Mongolia participated in agricultural and livestock cooperatives, but this has increased to 97.7% in April this year, basically completing agricultural and livestock cooperativization. The vigorous development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in various countries is an important factor in the further development of agriculture.

    Unremitting Efforts

    The great achievements made by socialist countries in the first half of this year are inseparable from the full expression of political enthusiasm and labor activism by the working people of various countries. In accelerating the construction of socialism and communism, they have put forward heroic slogans: the Soviet people propose to complete the seven-year plan in six years or less, the Korean people want to complete the first five-year plan two years and four months ahead of schedule, the Bulgarian people want to complete the third five-year plan in three or four years, and the Hungarian people want to complete the three-year plan one year ahead of schedule! In order to complete the plans for accelerating the development of the national economy ahead of schedule, the working people of various countries have launched a vigorous upsurge of socialist competition. After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet people widely launched a mass movement of technical innovation, invention, creation, and rationalization proposals. More than two million people participated in this movement on the production front throughout the Soviet Union. The working people of Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Albania also carried out socialist competitions in full swing in the first half of this year to celebrate the 10th and 15th anniversaries of their founding. In the "Chollima" movement, the people of North Korea even completed the industrial gross output value target of the five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, which is two months earlier than the original target of completing the five-year plan two years and four months ahead of schedule. In these competitions, the working people of various countries are high-spirited, exert their efforts, tap potentials, innovate technologies, increase production and save resources, improve quality, reduce costs, and increase labor productivity, ensuring the successful completion of the production plan for the first half of the year.

    The establishment of "Communist Labor Brigades" in the Soviet Union and "Socialist Labor Brigades" in other socialist countries has greatly promoted the progress of socialist competition in these countries. In this movement, many heroic figures with communist styles have emerged. Soviet textile worker Valya Gaganova is one of them. Gaganova voluntarily went from an advanced group to a backward group to help improve work. Her noble communist behavior greatly inspired the communist builders of the Soviet Union and was praised by the Party, the government, and the people. Currently, a movement to learn from Gaganova – advanced leading the backward – is being widely launched throughout the Soviet Union.

    Sharp Contrast

    In the first half of this year, the economy of the socialist camp developed rapidly, while the economy of the capitalist world remained fraught with crises. Although the U.S. economy experienced some "recovery" in the first half of the year, as U.S. economist Hyman Lumer analyzed: significant declines in exports, large increases in military spending, growth in national and personal debt, excess industrial production capacity, and continued growth in long-term unemployment "all of these developments create instability in the (U.S.) economy, paving the way for a more serious crisis in the not-too-distant future." It is also meaningful to compare the production situation in North Korea and North Vietnam with South Korea and South Vietnam, which serve as "American showcases." In the first half of this year, North Korea's total industrial output value increased by 75%, and pig iron production increased by 1.3 times compared to the same period last year; while South Korea's industry declined across the board, and pig iron production decreased by another 69% compared to the same period last year. North Vietnam's early rice achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, while South Vietnam's early rice production has declined year after year, and some areas are expected to have 30% to 40% smaller harvest than last year. All of these situations once again prove that the newborn socialist system has incomparable superiority over the decaying capitalist system.

    Moving Forward at High Speed

　　In the first half of this year, the national economies of the socialist countries have maintained a high rate of development, and have taken another major step forward in the peaceful economic competition with the capitalist world. For example, the planned annual growth rate of production in the Soviet Union this year is 7.7%, but in reality, it has reached 12% in the first half of the year. If we compare the production growth situation in the first half of this year with the first half of the previous two years, we can clearly see that the growth rate of industrial production in the Soviet Union is not decreasing with the expansion of production scale, but is maintaining a high speed of progress: in the first half of 1957, Soviet industrial production increased by 10%, in 1958 it increased by 10.5%, and in the first half of this year it increased by 12%! This fact once again proves that high-speed development of production is a universal law of socialism.

    Splendid Prospects

    On the basis of the great achievements made by socialist countries in developing their national economies in the first half of this year, they are striving to achieve new achievements in the second half of the year. Recently, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU called on all working people in the Soviet Union to widely launch a nationwide socialist competition to complete the seven-year plan and technical innovation ahead of schedule, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea decided to widely launch a mass movement to develop animal husbandry and build power stations, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party put forward the task of further developing agriculture, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers made specific measures to expand the irrigated area, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party called for full use of land to further develop large-scale agricultural production, and the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party made new measures to improve the living standards of the people. At the same time, the working people of various countries are pushing the socialist competitions with various contents such as completing the production plans and long-term plans ahead of schedule, technical innovation, and celebrating national days to a new climax. It can be imagined that in the second half of this year, many new landscapes will be added to the front lines of communist and socialist construction in socialist countries.

    The resolution of the 21st Congress of the CPSU pointed out that the Soviet seven-year plan has begun the decisive stage of peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism. 1959 is the first year of the Soviet seven-year plan and also a year in which other socialist countries are accelerating the development of their national economies. Therefore, the great achievements made by socialist countries in developing their national economies in the first half of this year are of great significance. The socialist camp has won the first battle in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries, which indicates that in this competition, socialism will achieve the expected comprehensive victory. An even more glorious and splendid prospect is awaiting us!

　　从半年看前景
　　程光锐
    东风得意马蹄疾！1959年上半年，社会主义阵营在同资本主义国家进行和平经济竞赛的道路上，又飞速跨过了一段新的途程。
    1958年是社会主义阵营各国飞速发展的一年，整个社会主义阵营的工业产量比1937年增加了四倍，已占全世界工业总产量的三分之一以上。在这个巨大成就的基础上，许多国家都提出了加速发展国民经济的新的长期计划。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会制订了七年计划，开始了全面建设共产主义的新时期。计划规定，到1965年工业总产值将增加80％、农业总产值将增加70％。波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会制订的七年计划规定，到1965年工业生产增加80％、农产品增加30％。保加利亚加速发展国民经济的计划规定，工业生产到1962年大约将比1957年增加一倍，到1965年大约将比1957年增加两倍到三倍。其他国家也在加速进行三年计划或五年计划。社会主义各国加速建设社会主义和共产主义的计划所展示的灿烂前景，大大鼓舞了这些国家劳动人民的政治热情和劳动热情。
    生产的成就
    1959年上半年是不平凡的半年，是社会主义国家在共产主义和社会主义建设战线上获得巨大胜利的半年。
        请看社会主义各国劳动人民提前和超额完成今年上半年生产计划的捷报！在工业生产方面：今年上半年同去年上半年相比，苏联增加了12％，阿尔巴尼亚增加了26.1％，保加利亚增加了23.4％，匈牙利约增加了9％，越南国营工业生产增加了62.3％，德意志民主共和国工业生产增加了12.4％，朝鲜增加了75％，并且提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划，蒙古增加了8.3％，波兰增加了9.3％，罗马尼亚重工业生产增加了20.5％、消费品工业增加了10.3％，捷克斯洛伐克工业生产增加了11％。——这不是一些普通的数字，这是鼓舞人心的社会主义的光辉诗篇！
    1959年上半年许多社会主义国家喜庆丰收。目前苏联人民正在争取七年计划的第一个大丰收。越南早稻已获得了空前大丰收，产量超过了早稻收成最好的1956年。朝鲜的小麦等夏季作物也获得了空前大丰收。保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克等国家也都可望丰收。
    在畜牧业生产方面，今年上半年也获得了很大的发展。苏联肉的收购计划完成了135％；同去年上半年相比，集体农庄和国营农场牛的头数增加了七百一十万头，猪增加了六百三十万口，羊增加七百五十万头。蒙古五种牲畜所接幼畜比去年多五十万头。朝鲜的猪增加34％，波兰牲畜头数增长了二十万头。
    社会主义国家生产的不断扩大，保证了人民生活水平的不断提高。今年上半年，苏联又为人民多生产了一亿四千四百万平方米纺织品，建筑了总面积达一千三百六十万平方米的住宅。苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克都降低了物价。朝鲜职工的货币工资比去年同期增加了43％，匈牙利居民的收入增加了8％。
    思想的丰收
    半年来，社会主义各国不仅在生产战线上获得了巨大的胜利，而且在思想战线上也有很大的收获。今年上半年，苏联全面展开了共产主义教育，根据党的第二十一次代表大会决议，苏联共产党采取了一系列的重要措施，来进一步加强思想工作，教育和培养共产主义新人。苏联建立“共产主义劳动队”和其他社会主义国家建立“社会主义劳动队”的运动波澜壮阔。苏联劳动人民提出了“按照共产主义的方式工作、学习和生活”的口号，许多社会主义国家的干部参加体力劳动、作家接近人民、学校同生活联系。在苏联，各地劳动人民并且建立了人民纠察队、同志审判会、街道委员会等群众组织。广大人民主动和积极地参加社会政治生活，反映了他们的思想觉悟水平正在不断提高。社会主义国家人民在思想战线上的丰收，正是这些国家在生产战线上胜利的重要保证。
        重大的措施
    这些巨大成就的取得并不是偶然的。半年来，社会主义各国党和政府在经济方面采取了一系列的重大措施。今年上半年，苏联充分发挥企业的积极性，加强了中央和各加盟共和国的国家计划委员会的工作，加强了各经济区之间的联系和合作。因此，今年上半年所有的加盟共和国和国民经济委员会都超额完成了生产计划。其他社会主义国家也采取了许多措施，调整生产关系，促进生产力的发展。例如，波兰继续注意工业各部门的协调发展，消除轻重工业发展不平衡的现象，同时注意生产力的合理配置。保加利亚改组了国家和经济的领导机构，成立了新的行政经济区。德意志民主共和国实行了社会主义改建，合理地组织生产。此外，各国党加强了对生产的领导工作，加强了社会主义竞赛中的政治思想工作，对鼓起劳动人民的干劲也起了很大的作用。
    在农业生产方面，许多国家采取了深耕密植、多施肥料、选用良种、加强田间管理、大兴水利等措施，保证了农作物的丰收和农业的进一步发展。
    特别值得提起的是，今年上半年许多国家的党在农业社会主义改造方面进行了巨大的努力，使得这些国家的农业合作化运动获得了迅速的发展。今年春天，匈牙利的农业生产合作社已比去年年底增加了一千多个，它的耕地面积在全国耕地总面积中所占的比重，已从去年的15.6％增加到现在的36.1％。越南的农业生产合作社已从去年的五千多个增加到现在的一万六千多个，参加合作社农户所占全国总农户的比重，也从去年的4.2％增加到现在的21.5％。到4月1日止，罗马尼亚全国参加集体农庄和共耕社的农户在全国总农户中所占的比重，已由1957年的42％增加到62.3％。去年11月，蒙古全国只有56％的牧户参加了农牧业合作社，而今年4月已增加到97.7％，基本上完成了农牧业合作化。各国农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展，是农业获得进一步发展的重要因素。
    不懈的努力
    社会主义国家今年上半年取得了巨大的成就，是同各国劳动人民充分发挥政治热情和劳动积极性分不开的。在加速进行社会主义和共产主义建设中，他们纷纷提出了豪迈的口号：苏联人民提出要用六年或更短的时间完成七年计划，朝鲜人民要提前两年四个月完成第一个五年计划，保加利亚人民要用三、四年的时间完成第三个五年计划，匈牙利人民要提前一年完成三年计划！为了提前完成加速发展国民经济的计划，各国劳动人民掀起了波澜壮阔的社会主义竞赛的热潮。苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，苏联人民广泛地展开了群众性的技术革新、发明创造和合理化建议运动，在全苏生产战线上参加这个运动的达到二百万人以上。波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，为了迎接国庆十周年和十五周年，今年上半年也把社会主义竞赛进行得热火朝天。朝鲜人民在“千里马”运动中，甚至提前两年半完成了五年计划工业总产值计划，这比原来提出的提前两年四个月完成五年计划指标又提前了两个月。在这些竞赛中，各国劳动人民意气风发，发挥干劲，挖掘潜力，革新技术，增产节约，提高质量，降低成本，提高劳动生产率，保证了上半年生产计划的胜利完成。
    苏联建立“共产主义劳动队”和其他社会主义国家建立“社会主义劳动队”的运动，大大推动了这些国家社会主义竞赛的进展。在这个运动中，涌现了不少具有共产主义风格的英雄人物。像苏联纺织女工瓦利亚·加干诺娃就是其中的一个。加干诺娃自愿由先进的小组到落后的小组去帮助改进工作。她的崇高的共产主义行为，大大鼓舞了苏联的共产主义建设者，受到了党、政府和人民的表扬。目前，一个学习加干诺娃——先进带动落后的运动，正在全苏各地广泛地展开。
    鲜明的对比
    今年上半年，社会主义阵营经济飞速发展，资本主义世界经济仍然危机四伏。美国上半年经济虽然有所“回升”，但是，正如美国经济学家海曼·拉默所分析的：出口显著减少，军事开支大大增加，国债和个人债务增长，工业生产能力过剩，长期失业人数继续增长，“所有这些情况发展造成（美国）经济的不稳定，为不太远的将来更严重的危机铺平了道路。”把朝鲜北部和越南北方的生产情况同作为“美国橱窗”的南朝鲜和南越作一对比，也是很有意义的事情。今年上半年朝鲜北部工业总产值增加了75％，生铁产量比去年同期增加了一点三倍；而南朝鲜的工业却全面衰退，生铁产量比去年同期又减少了69％。今年越南北方早稻空前大丰收，而南越早稻产量却连年下降，今年有的地区要比去年歉收30％到40％。所有这些情况都再一次证明，新生的社会主义制度比腐朽的资本主义制度具有无比的优越性。
    高速度前进
　　今年上半年，社会主义各国国民经济的发展都保持着很高的速度，在同资本主义世界进行和平经济竞赛中又大大迈进了一步。例如，苏联今年生产计划的全年增长率是7.7％，而上半年实际上已达到了12％。如果拿今年上半年同前两年上半年的生产增长情况相比，也可以清楚地看出来苏联工业生产增长率不是随着产量幅度的扩大而下降，而是保持着高速度前进：1957年上半年苏联工业生产增加了10％，1958年增加了10.5％，今年上半年则增加了12％！这个事实，再一次证明了生产的高速度发展是社会主义的普遍规律。
        灿烂的前景
    社会主义国家在今年上半年发展国民经济方面取得巨大成就的基础上，争取下半年取得新的成就。最近，苏共中央全会号召苏联全体劳动人民为提前完成七年计划和技术革新而广泛开展全民性的社会主义竞赛，朝鲜劳动党中央全会决定要广泛开展发展畜牧业和建设发电站的群众运动，波兰统一工人党中央全会提出了进一步发展农业的任务，保共中央和部长会议作出了扩大灌溉面积的具体措施，捷共中央号召充分利用土地进一步发展大规模农业生产，罗马尼亚工人党中央全会作出了提高人民生活水平的新的措施。同时，各国劳动人民正把提前完成下半年生产计划和长期计划、技术革新、迎接国庆等各种内容的社会主义竞赛推向一个新的高潮。可以想见，今年下半年，在社会主义各国的共产主义和社会主义建设战线上，将增添许多新的景色。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议指出：苏联七年计划开始了社会主义同资本主义和平竞赛的决定性阶段。1959年是苏联七年计划的第一年，也是其他社会主义国家加速发展国民经济的一年。因此，今年上半年社会主义国家在发展国民经济中所取得的巨大成就具有重要的意义。社会主义阵营在同资本主义国家进行的和平经济竞赛中旗开得胜，预示着在这一场竞赛中，社会主义将获得预期的全面胜利。更加光辉灿烂的前景在迎接着我们！
