Folk Songs from the Yellow River Flood Area

　　The flood area will transform into a granary
　　Drainage ditches form a network,
　　Pits and ponds are built in rows.
　　Sand beaches turn into green seas,
　　Flowers and fruits fill the mountains.
　　The spring breeze turns the wheat waves,
　　The autumn sun shines on the fragrant rice.
　　Irrigation is possible in drought,
　　Water enters the pond after rain.
　　Willows are planted on both sides of the road,
　　The flood area will transform into a granary.

　　Now the Yellow River water comes to Fugou
　　In the past, Yellow River water came to Fugou,
　　Everything was washed away.
　　Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land turned into a vast ocean,
　　Wives and children were separated and fled elsewhere.
　　Tree bark and wild grass were eaten clean,
　　Corpses were everywhere and no one collected them.
　　Now the Yellow River water comes to Fugou,
　　The people are all filled with joy.
　　Honest and obedient to the cadres,
　　Flocks of geese and ducks swim on the water.
　　It can irrigate fields and generate electricity,
　　Guaranteeing a bumper harvest.

　　Today the Yellow River water lowers its head
　　The Yellow River water flows slowly downward,
　　As if being led by someone.
　　Flowing into the ditch like a silver ribbon,
　　Flowing into the pond, bright and glistening.
　　In the past, everyone feared the Yellow River water,
　　Today the Yellow River water lowers its head.

　　黄泛区民歌
　　泛区要变米粮仓沟渠形成网，坑塘筑成行。沙滩变绿海，花果满山岗。春风翻麦浪，秋日照稻香。旱天能灌溉，雨后水入塘。道路两边栽杨柳，泛区要变米粮仓。
　　如今黄水来扶沟从前黄水来扶沟，一切东西被冲走。万亩良田变汪洋，妻离子散逃外头。树皮野草都吃净，死尸遍地无人收。而今黄水来扶沟，人民个个喜心头。老老实实服人管，成群鹅鸭水上游。能灌田来能发电，保证生产大丰收。
　　今日黄水低下头黄水缓缓往下流，好像被人牵着走。流到渠里像银带，流到塘里明溜溜。从前黄水人人怕，今日黄水低下头。
