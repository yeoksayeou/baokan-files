　　Come, Go, Enter, Exit
　　Liu Zijiu
　　"Come" refers to the "come" in "come from the masses," and "go" refers to the "go" in "go to the masses"; "enter" refers to the "enter" in deep-going, and "exit" refers to the "exit" in "simple and accessible."
　　"Come" and "go," "enter" and "exit," are all unity of opposites. Both are mutually dependent, mutually restrictive, and mutually interactive. If one does not "come from the masses," one certainly cannot "go to the masses." If one blindly insists on "going," it is a kind of blind action, and the result will surely be met with a bloody nose. At the same time, if it is not for the purpose of "going to the masses," then "coming from the masses" becomes an unconscious and aimless action. That is to say, only things that "come from the masses" can effectively "go to the masses" and become something that correctly guides people's actions. At the same time, only through the practical verification of "going to the masses" can it be proved and determined whether those things that "come from the masses" are true or false, that is, whether they conform to objective reality. Anything that is met with setbacks when "going to the masses" proves that the so-called "coming from the masses" was untrue, incomplete, not deep, or not thorough.
　　The same is true of the relationship between "enter" and "exit." For any matter, if a person's "enter" (understanding) is not deep, thorough, true, or complete, then his "exit" (expression, explanation) will certainly be unclear, ambiguous, obscure, or incomprehensible. Only those who have a deep, thorough, true, and complete understanding of a certain thing can speak clearly, explain clearly, be methodical, and be logical. "Deep-going" is the content of "simple and accessible," and "simple and accessible" is the expression form or method of "deep-going." Without a deep foundation of "deep-going," wanting to "simple and accessible" is like building a skyscraper on the beach. Conversely, it is also true that anyone who cannot "simple and accessible" about a certain thing proves that he has not been able to "deep-going" into that thing. Some people hold the view that "it can be understood implicitly, but cannot be expressed in words," which is merely an excuse for not being able to "deep-going" into things. Only those who can understand something intuitively and comprehensively ("deep-going") can express something vividly and realistically ("simple and accessible").
　　Things that can truly "go to the masses" and are "simple and accessible" that are welcomed by the broad masses are those that have been "refined, discarding the dross and selecting the essence, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other, and from the outside to the inside" from the original, simple, and disorganized "come from the masses" and "deep-going" things (refinement, improvement), thereby making them more systematic, more organized, more concentrated, and more typical. It is a transformation from the perceptual to the rational.
　　From "come" to "go," from "enter" to "exit," is not a static, uncritical, simple relocation of positions, but a complex process of processing and development. Therefore, this kind of "go" and "exit" are no longer simple, original "come" and "enter" things, but things that have been processed by the human brain, this machine of thought, through a series of processes such as analysis, synthesis, judgment, and reasoning.
　　Humanity is in such a process of coming and going, entering and exiting, constantly recognizing the world, explaining the world, and transforming the world, and in such a process of constantly recognizing the world, explaining the world, and transforming the world, constantly transforming itself and improving itself.

　　来、去、入、出
　　刘子久
    “来”者“从群众中来”之“来”，“去”者“到群众中去”之“去”也；“入”者深入之“入”，“出”者“浅出”之“出”也。
    “来”和“去”、“入”和“出”都是对立的统一。两者都是互相依存，互相制约，互相作用的。不“从群众中来”固然不能“到群众中去”，如果闭着眼睛硬要“去”的话，那就是一种盲动，其结果一定会碰得头破血流。同时，如果不是为了“到群众中去”，那么，“从群众中来”也就成为一种无意识、无目的的动作。这就是说，只有“从群众中来”的东西，才能够有效地“到群众中去”，而成为正确地指导人们的行动的东西；同时，也只有通过“到群众中去”的实践的验证，才能够证明、断定那些“从群众中来”的东西是真是假，即是否符合客观实际。凡是在“到群众中去”的时候，碰了钉子的东西，也就证明原来那些所谓“从群众中来”的东西是不真、不全、不深、不透的东西。
    谈到“入”和“出”的关系也一样。对于任何一件事情，凡是“入”（理解）的不深、不透、不真、不全的人，那么，他的“出”（表达、说明）也就一定是不清、不楚、不明、不白。只有那些对于某一事物理解得深透真全的人，才能够说得清清楚楚，讲得明明白白，有条有理，合乎逻辑。“深入”是“浅出”的内容，“浅出”是“深入”的表现形式或手法。没有“深入”作厚深基础的人，要想“浅出”那就好像要在沙滩上建筑高楼大厦一样的困难。反之也是一样，凡是对于某一事物，不能够“浅出”的人，也就证明他对于该事物还没有能够“深入”。有些人抱有一种“可以意会，不可以言传”的说法，只不过是对于事物尚未能够“深入”的一种遁词而已。只有那些对于某一事物能够心领神会、融会贯通（“深入”）的人，才能够把某一事物表现得唯妙唯肖，情景逼真（“浅出”）。
    真正能够“到群众中去”的“浅出”的受广大群众欢迎的东西，是对于那些原始的、朴素的、杂乱无章的“从群众中来”“深入”的东西，经过了“去粗存精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的加工（提炼，提高），从而也就是使它成为一种系统化、条理化、更集中、更典型了的东西。是一种由感性的东西上升为理性的东西。
    从“来”到“去”，从“入”到“出”，并不是一种原封不动的、囫囵吞枣的、简单的位置的移动，而是一个复杂的加工、发展过程。因之，这种“去”和“出”的东西，已经不是简单的原有的“来”和“入”的东西，而是经过了人的头脑这部思想的机器，进行了分析、综合、判断、推理等一系列的加工的东西。
    人类就是在这样一种来来去去、入入出出的发展过程中，不断地去认识世界，说明世界，改造世界，并且在这样一种不断地认识世界、说明世界、改造世界的过程中，来不断地改造自己、提高自己的。
