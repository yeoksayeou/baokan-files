    Greeting the Great National Day with Production Triumphs
    Romanian Industrial and Mining Enterprises Achieve Increased Production Guarantees
    Bucharest, August 21 (reported by this newspaper) Romanian industrial and mining enterprises are completing their increased production and frugality pledges made to greet National Day ahead of schedule. Many farmers are joining collective farms as a practical action to celebrate National Day.
    After the "May Day" this year, Romanian enterprises nationwide formulated plans to increase production and practice economy, actively participating in the production competition movement to welcome National Day. Recently, the Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee's resolution on increasing wages and lowering prices has further inspired the workers' enthusiasm for production. Enterprises in various regions have actively tapped potential and increased production and frugality targets, with many enterprises increasing them by more than double. Many enterprises have now fulfilled their guarantees.
    Steelworkers in machine-manufacturing enterprises in the Stalin region have already over-produced steel capable of manufacturing five hundred trucks beyond the plan, fulfilling their production guarantee to welcome the festival ahead of schedule. At the same time, the production cost per ton of steel was reduced by 200 lei. The Hunedoara Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise completed the pre-holiday production increase plan thirteen days ahead of schedule. From the beginning of the year to August 17, the electric furnace workers have overproduced 5,100 tons of special steel. The Rulmenti Factory in Stalin City completed the production task for the first eight months of this year on August 18, also saving metal capable of manufacturing 30,000 bearings.
    Oil drilling workers have achieved great success in reducing drilling costs and accelerating drilling speeds. Drilling workers in Zemes have already started doing September's work in early August. Drilling workers in Basikov saved 10 million lei by August 1, completing the pre-holiday savings plan twenty-three days ahead of schedule.
    In the textile industry, most factories have completed their production plans to welcome the festival ahead of schedule. The utilization coefficient of machinery and equipment has increased by an average of 5% compared to last December. In the first seven months of this year, factories have overproduced more than 300,000 tons of cotton yarn and more than 2.52 million meters of cloth.
    Many shoe-making enterprises have also fulfilled their production guarantees to welcome the festival. Since June 1, shoe factories across the country have overproduced 61,000 pairs of leather shoes.
    The famous pharmaceutical factory, Iasi Antibiotics Factory, completed the August production plan half a month ahead of schedule and has saved 10 million lei this year.
    At present, in various industrial and mining sectors across the country, many advanced producers have begun to lead backward production teams, and some production teams have achieved good results.
    This practice is now being promoted nationwide, which will play a significant role in completing the 1959 production and savings plans, as well as improving the technical skills of workers.
    In order to welcome the National Day, the polyvinyl chloride workshop of the Turda Chemical Factory has been put into production ahead of schedule. This workshop, with an annual production capacity of 5,500 tons, will further increase Romania's plastic products. The cardboard factory of the joint reed processing plant jointly built by Romania, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia has also been put into production ahead of schedule, with an annual output of 2,000 tons of cardboard.
    Recently, many farmers in Petresti, Bacau and other regions have joined agricultural cooperative organizations. In Petresti region, nineteen collective farms were established in one day on August 16. Some farms are named "15th Anniversary of the Motherland's Liberation" to commemorate this great festival.

    用生产捷报迎接伟大国庆节
    罗马尼亚工矿企业纷纷实现增产保证
    本报布加勒斯特21日电　罗马尼亚工矿企业纷纷提前完成为迎接国庆提出的增产节约保证。许多农民以加入集体农庄的实际行动迎接国庆节。
    在今年“五一”节后，罗马尼亚全国各企业都订出增产节约计划，积极参加了迎接国庆的生产竞赛运动。最近，罗马尼亚工人党中央全会关于增加工资、降低物价的决议更加鼓舞了工人的生产热情。各地企业都积极挖掘潜力，提高了增产节约指标，有不少企业提高了一倍以上。现在许多企业已经实现了它们的保证。
    斯大林州各机器制造企业的炼钢工人已经超计划生产了能制造五百辆载重汽车的钢，提前实现了他们迎接节日的生产保证，同时还使每吨钢的生产成本降低了二百列伊。洪尼多阿拉钢铁联合企业提前十三天完成了节日前的增产计划，从年初到8月17日，电炉工人已超计划生产了五千一百吨特种钢。斯大林城的鲁耳门蒂工厂在8月18日就完成了今年头八个月的生产任务，还节约了能制造三万个轴承的金属。
    石油钻井工人在降低钻井成本和加快钻井速度方面获得很大成绩。泽梅希的钻井工人在8月初已经开始做9月份的工作。巴希科夫的钻井工人在8月1日已节约一千万列伊，提前二十三天完成了节日前的节约计划。
    在纺织工业中，大多数工厂已经提前完成了它们迎接节日的生产计划。机器设备的利用系数平均比去年12月提高了5％。各工厂在今年的头七个月中已经超计划生产了三十多万吨棉纱，二百五十二万多米的布匹。
    许多制鞋企业也实现了迎接节日的生产保证。从6月1日到现在，全国制鞋工厂已经超计划生产了六万一千双皮鞋。
    著名制药厂雅西抗生素工厂提前半个月完成了8月份生产计划，今年已经节约了一千万列伊。
    目前，在全国各工矿部门中，有许多先进生产者开始领导落后生产队，有些生产队已经获得良好成绩。
    现在这种做法正在全国范围内推广，它对完成1959年的生产计划和节约计划，以及提高工人的技术水平将会起很大作用。
    为了迎接国庆节，杜尔达化学工厂的聚氯乙烯车间已经提前投入生产。这个每年生产能力为五千五百吨的车间将使罗马尼亚的塑料制品进一步增加。罗马尼亚同波兰、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克合建的芦苇加工联合厂的厚纸厂也提前投入了生产，每年可产厚纸二千吨。
    最近在彼特兹迪、巴科等州有许多农民加入了农业合作组织。彼特兹迪州在8月16日一天中就成立了十九个集体农庄。有的农庄取名为“祖国解放十五周年”，来纪念这个伟大节日。
