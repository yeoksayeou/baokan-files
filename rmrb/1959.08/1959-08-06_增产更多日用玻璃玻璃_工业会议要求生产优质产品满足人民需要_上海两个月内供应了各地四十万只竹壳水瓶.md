Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 5th. The National Glass Industry Conference, recently convened in Shanghai by the Ministry of Light Industry, discussed the issue of increasing the production of more and better daily-use glass products to meet the needs of the people's lives. The conference called on all glass industry workers across the country to quickly launch an increase production and practice economy movement centered on high yield, high quality, and low consumption, to continue to exert their utmost efforts, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national plan.

In the first half of this year, glass factories in various regions have achieved new developments in production based on the Great Leap Forward of last year. According to statistics from 286 factories, the total tonnage of various glass products increased by more than 34% compared with the first half of last year, and the product quality of many factories has also improved compared with the past. However, due to the increase in social purchasing power and the development of production and construction, glass products still cannot meet the needs of all parties.

The conference pointed out that the primary task of the glass industry at present is to strive to increase the production of various daily-use glass products. The range of daily-use glass products is very wide, including daily necessities such as thermos bottles and glass cups, lampshades for lighting in rural areas, medicine bottles for hospitals to hold medicines, as well as wine bottles, perfume bottles, ink bottles, and so on. Although the output value of these daily-use glassware is small, the demand is very large. When arranging production plans, all regions must first develop products in this area.

The conference required glass factories in various regions to strive to reduce the consumption quotas of raw materials and materials, and to practice strict economy. The conference pointed out that the potential in this area is still very large. Taking soda ash as an example, the amount of alkali used for the same ton of glass liquid can be as high as 300 kilograms or as low as about 150 kilograms. If all reach the advanced level of 150 kilograms, more products can be produced with the same amount of soda ash. In terms of fuel, some factories only need one ton of coal to produce one ton of glass, while others need three or four tons or more, and the potential for savings is even greater. The conference believes that improving product quality and extending product life is the greatest saving for glass factories. In particular, various glass containers used as packaging materials can avoid damage to many materials after the quality is improved.

A total of more than 800 representatives attended the conference. After the conference concluded, the representatives unanimously expressed that they would work harder in the second half of the year to increase the production of more daily-use glass.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 5th. Shanghai bamboo shell thermos bottles, which are known for their good quality throughout the country, had more than doubled their output in the second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter, and the output in July alone was higher than the entire first quarter. Since the beginning of June, Shanghai has supplied more than 400,000 bamboo shell thermos bottles to various parts of the country.

Since the beginning of this year, the sales of Shanghai bamboo shell thermos bottles have increased significantly. In order to expand the production of bamboo shell thermos bottles, the Shanghai Glass Industry Company and the Shanghai Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station jointly organized a bamboo shell professional team in the second quarter, which went deep into various places to purchase bamboo shell materials and received strong support from various places. When the National Third Category Materials Exchange Conference was held in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi and other provinces all helped Shanghai expand its source of moso bamboo, ensuring the need to increase the production of bamboo shell thermos bottles.

The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has a small but effective propaganda team. They carry out propaganda work in important production key sections such as steelmaking furnaces, iron-smelting furnaces, and gas furnaces, spreading advanced experiences to workers, sending good news to pace-setters and good deeds that appear in production, and promoting a greater production upsurge.

    增产更多日用玻璃玻璃
    工业会议要求生产优质产品满足人民需要
    上海两个月内供应了各地四十万只竹壳水瓶
    据新华社上海5日电　轻工业部最近在上海召开的全国玻璃工业会议，讨论了增产更多更好的日用玻璃制品，适应人民生活需要的问题。会议号召全国玻璃工业职工迅速开展以高产、优质、低耗为中心的增产节约运动，继续鼓足干劲，力争完成和超额完成今年国家计划。
    今年上半年，各地玻璃工厂在去年大跃进的基础上，生产又有了新的发展。据二百八十六个工厂统计，各种玻璃制品的总吨数比去年上半年提高34％以上，不少工厂产品质量也比过去有所提高。但是，由于社会购买力的提高和生产建设的发展，目前玻璃产品仍然不能适应各方面的需要。
    会议指出：当前玻璃工业首要的任务是努力增产各种人们日用的玻璃制品。玻璃日用品包括范围很广，其中如日常必需的保温瓶、玻璃杯，农村点灯用的灯罩，医院装药用的药瓶，以及酒瓶、香水瓶、墨水瓶等等。这些日用玻璃器皿虽然产值很小，但需要量很大。各地在安排生产计划时，必须首先发展这方面的产品。
    会议要求各地玻璃工厂努力降低原料、材料的消耗定额，厉行节约。会议指出，目前这方面的潜力还很大。如以纯碱为例，同样一吨玻璃液的用碱量，高的达到三百公斤，低的只要一百五十公斤左右。如果都达到一百五十公斤这一先进水平，用同样多的纯碱就可以生产更多的产品。在燃料方面，有的厂生产一吨玻璃只要用一吨煤，有的却要用三、四吨以上，节约的潜力更大。会议认为，玻璃工厂提高产品质量，延长产品使用寿命，是最大的节约。特别是当作包装材料的各种玻璃器皿，质量提高后还可以避免许多物资的损坏。
    出席这次会议的代表共有八百多人，代表们在会议结束以后，一致表示下半年要以更大的干劲，增产更多的日用玻璃。
    据新华社上海5日电　以质量好著称全国的上海竹壳热水瓶，今年第二季度的产量比第一季度高出一倍多，7月份一个月的产量比整个第一季度还高。从6月初到现在，上海供应全国各地的竹壳热水瓶已有四十多万只。
    今年以来，上海竹壳热水瓶的销路大增。为了扩大竹壳热水瓶的生产，上海市玻璃工业公司和上海市百货采购供应站，在第二季度联合组织了一个竹壳专业小组，深入各地采购竹壳材料，得到了各地大力的支援。当全国第三类物资交流会在上海召开时，浙江、福建、江西等省，都帮助上海扩大了毛竹货源，保证了增产竹壳热水瓶的需要。（附图片）
    重庆钢铁公司有一支人数不多的宣传鼓动队。他们在炼钢炉、化铁炉、煤气炉等重要生产关键工段，进行宣传鼓动工作，为工人们传播先进经验，给生产上出现的标兵、好人好事送喜报、推动更大的生产高潮。
