    Vigorously Promote Silage Feed
    Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, China's silage feed work has developed from nothing to something, and from little to much. In 1958, the national silage work was fully launched.
    Silage feed has many advantages: First, it can greatly increase the amount of forage. After the forage is dried, the texture is rough, livestock do not like to eat it, and the utilization rate is very low. Take dry corn stalks as an example, half is eaten and half is wasted; but silage corn stalks are very popular with livestock, and can generally be eaten completely. Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, has done experiments that showed cows can only eat 47% of dry corn stalks, but can eat 95% of silage corn stalks. Second, it can greatly improve the quality of forage. Silage feed is not exposed to the sun or rain, and generally retains 10-15% more nutrients than dried feed. At the same time, silage feed is easy to digest, and livestock gain weight easily after eating it.
    In order to provide a large and high-quality material basis for the development of animal husbandry production, and to eliminate the phenomenon of livestock weakness and death due to lack of grass in some areas in the past, we must further vigorously promote silage feed this year. This year's autumn crops are growing well, and many places have experience in silage. All localities should make full use of these favorable conditions, seize the favorable time in August and September, and earnestly do this work well.
    China has abundant straws and vines suitable for silage in various places. According to preliminary estimates, if one-third of the country's corn stalks are ensiled this year, there will be 80 billion jin; if 30% of the country's sweet potato vines are stored, there will be more than 40 billion jin. In addition, there are many peanut seedlings and green grass. Such abundant stalks and vines are good conditions for us to prepare silage feed on a large scale. We should make good use of them to develop animal husbandry production.
    Experience over the past few years has shown that to do a good job in silage feed, it is first necessary to properly arrange labor. Some people think that silage requires a lot of labor and conflicts with the busy autumn farming season. This is true. But it can be solved. The solution, in addition to establishing a comprehensive perspective ideologically and not underestimating the silage feed work of animal husbandry, is to adopt some methods to properly arrange labor. Staggering the time for agricultural autumn harvest and autumn planting with the time for silage feed is a better way. Generally speaking, the current agricultural work is relatively light, and there is still some time before the busy season. All localities can use this period to organize commune members to ensile a large amount of green grass, and can also use this period to repair old silos and build new silos to make specific preparations for silage. Last year, many areas dug silos in the fields for silage, which was also a good method and can be studied and promoted.
    Although there is still some time before large-scale silage, this year's silage feed plan should be formulated immediately and implemented to grassroots units to supervise its earnest implementation.
    The technology of silage feed preparation has been promoted in many areas in recent years, but it is still not able to meet the needs of carrying out this work on a large scale. All localities should seize this short gap to further disseminate silo construction and silage technology, so that this year's silage feed is prepared in large quantities and of good quality.
    The harvesting of silage raw materials is generally scattered over the three months of August, September, and October. The organization of silage feed should be specifically arranged according to the current situation so that this work can be carried out step by step.

### 大搞青贮饲料

    大搞青贮饲料
    解放以来，在党的正确领导下，我国的青贮饲料工作已从无到有、从少到多地开展起来，1958年全国青贮工作全面展开。
    青贮饲料的好处很多：第一，可以大大增加饲草数量。饲草晒干之后，质地粗糙，牲畜不爱吃，利用率很低；拿干玉米秸来说，吃一半糟塌一半；但是青贮的玉米秸，牲畜很爱吃，大体可以吃完。辽宁省凤城县做过试验，干玉米秸，牛只能吃掉47％，青贮玉米秸，就能吃掉95％。第二，可以大大提高饲草的质量。青贮饲料不经太阳曝晒，不经风吹雨淋，一般要比晒干的多保存10—15％的养料。同时，青贮饲料容易消化，牲畜吃了爱上膘。
    为了给发展畜牧业生产提供量多质好的物质基础，消灭过去有些地区因为缺草而发生牲畜瘦弱死亡现象，今年必须进一步大搞青贮饲料。今年大秋作物生长良好，许多地方又都有青贮的经验。各地应该充分利用这些有利条件，抓紧8、9两个月有利时机，切实做好这项工作。
    我国各地适宜青贮的秸秆、藤蔓是十分丰富的。据初步估计，如果把今年全国的玉米秸的三分之一青贮起来，就有八百亿斤；把全国甘薯藤的30％贮藏起来，就有四百多亿斤。此外还有很多的花生秧和青草。这样丰富的秸秆藤蔓，正是我们大规模调制青贮饲料的好条件。我们应该很好的利用它们来发展畜牧业生产。
    几年来的经验说明，要做好青贮饲料工作，首先必须妥善安排劳力。有些人认为青贮需要劳动力多，和三秋农忙有矛盾。这是事实。但是能够解决的。解决的办法，除了要在思想上树立全面观点，不轻视畜牧业的青贮饲料工作以外，还要采用一些方法来妥善安排劳力。错开农业秋收秋种和青贮饲料的时间是一个比较好的办法。就大部地区说，目前农活比较轻，离大忙还有一段时间，各地可以利用这个时期，组织社员大量青贮青草，也可以利用这段时间修理旧窖和建筑新窖，为青贮做好具体准备。去年许多地区，在地头挖窖青贮，也是一个比较好的办法，可以研究推广。
    目前虽然距大规模青贮还有一段时间，但是今年的青贮饲料的计划应该立即制订出来，并且落实到基层单位，督促认真进行。
    调制青贮饲料的技术，近年来虽然在不少地区推广，但是还不能适应大规模地进行这项工作的需要。各地应该抓住这个短暂的空隙，进一步传播建窖和青贮技术，使今年的青贮饲料调制得又多又好。
    青贮原料的收割，一般分散在8、9、10三个月的时间内，青贮饲料的组织工作应该根据当前的情况具体安排，才能使这项工作按步骤进行。
