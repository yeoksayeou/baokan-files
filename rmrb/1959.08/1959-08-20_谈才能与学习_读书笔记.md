　　On Talent and Learning
　　—Reading Notes
　　Tuan Yin
　　Some biographical articles seem to particularly emphasize showcasing the "natural intelligence" and "photographic memory" of ancient people, such as reciting scriptures at the age of five, and composing poetry at the age of seven, and so on. Recording these as historical facts requires no discussion. However, it is said that many young students, after reading these biographies of famous people, are not inspired and enlightened, but greatly discouraged, feeling that they are already in their teens or twenties, and have not yet shown any outstanding talent, and probably have no chance of achieving anything or making any contributions in their lives. The objective effect that biographies have, deserves the deep attention of biography writers. I believe that they can narrate how the talents of famous people are, but more important should be to narrate the other conditions for the development of the talents of famous people, and thus their success, that is, aspects that people can understand and learn from. Failing to do so will turn personal talent into something mysterious and unpredictable. This, besides making readers lament their lack of talent and feel discouraged, will not have any good effect.
　　Speaking of the issue of talent, people are all familiar with Marx's famous saying: "Genius is diligence." This is Marx's personal experience. That is to say, genius is not something mysterious. Normal people, as long as they make persistent efforts in the right direction, can obtain and develop their abilities in certain aspects.
　　Of course, no one will deny that people's natural endowments, the so-called anatomical and physiological characteristics, are different, with some being high and some low. Indeed, some people have extraordinary wisdom in a certain aspect at a very young age, and show excellent endowments for activities in a certain aspect (such as music, painting, poetry, etc.). For example, Beethoven could play the piano at the age of four, and Repin, Surikov and others showed painting ability at the age of four or five. The ancient Chinese poets Cao Zhi, Wang Can, Wang Bo, etc., also showed outstanding talents at a young age. We know that two years ago, there was a five-year-old child in Jilin Province who could play the erhu, and a four-year-old child in Guangzhou who could play the piano. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that the development of people's abilities in a certain aspect, some people are relatively easy and rapid, some are slow and laborious, some are good at image thinking, and some are good at logical thinking. This difference is not surprising. According to Pavlov's theory of two signal systems, this is because the two signal systems in the human nerve center may be in different relationships with each other, may be balanced, or the first signal system may be relatively dominant than the second signal system, or vice versa. Therefore, human higher nervous activity can be divided into three types: artistic, thinking, and intermediate. This natural characteristic of nerve type is a natural condition for the development of human abilities.
　　This natural condition, that is, innate endowment, is possessed by everyone, either in this aspect or in that aspect. At the same time, a person having a natural condition that can be developed in a certain aspect is not itself talent. The issue of talent must be viewed from the perspective of historical materialism: there is no abstract general talent, and anyone's talent is a product of certain historical and social needs. All historical geniuses can only be viewed as historical figures. What plays a decisive role in talent can only be the influence of the social environment, individual subjective efforts, and so on. Natural talent must be combined with social needs, labor, and life to give play to its role and to be realized. Anyone with extraordinary talent, if like Robinson Crusoe stranded on an isolated island divorced from social life, it would be difficult to become a genius, but only "smart when young, but not necessarily outstanding when grown up." At the same time, certain congenital characteristics of human anatomy, physiology and nerve structure are not absolutely immutable. According to Pavlov, the higher nervous system has, in addition to congenital characteristics, a supreme plasticity. People whose certain signal system is relatively dominant are not always able to develop only in one direction. Under the influence of living conditions, the original undeveloped characteristics and abilities can also be developed; because any activity requires the combined use of many kinds of abilities to be completed. That is to say, the social environment has a decisive influence on the formation and development of human abilities. The formation and development of any talent is the result of hard study and persistent dedication to a certain activity.
　　Looking at the great geniuses of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, they have all become great talents after experiencing hard study and tempering under certain innate conditions.
　　Take Marx as an example. His great contribution to mankind is the result of his lifelong diligence in studying and struggling. It is said that for many years he worked ten hours a day in the library of the British Museum in London, and continued to work at home until late at night. He had read more than 1,500 kinds of books, made outlines, wrote summaries and notes, and these alone could be compiled into many huge volumes. He studied all modern sciences, such as philosophy, history, economics, natural sciences, law, mathematics, chemistry, etc., with great dedication until he fully understood them. When Marx's daughter asked him to say his favorite motto, he said an ancient Latin proverb: "Nothing human is alien to me."
　　There are countless examples of people who have become great geniuses after going through the same path as Marx. Although Beethoven showed extraordinary ability in music at the age of four, without his father strictly disciplining him to study hard from the age of four, he may not have had such a high degree of development later. Pavlov also advised young people who want to climb the peak of science with his experience in doing academic work, to "develop a progressive habit in gathering knowledge from the beginning of the work", to spend hard work, and never to seek success by chance.
　　The Chinese people regard Zhuge Liang as the embodiment of wisdom, but Zhuge Liang said in his "Admonition to My Son": "Learning must be quiet, and talent must be learned: without learning, there is no way to broaden talent, and without ambition, there is no way to achieve learning; complacency will not encourage diligence, and recklessness will not govern nature." That is to say, if you want to become a genius, you must study hard. If you don't study, even if you have some talent, you can't develop this talent. Never rely on talent without learning. We usually only see and admire the side of Zhuge Liang's high wisdom, but how do we know that he gained and developed his wisdom after diligent study. From the example of Su Xun, who only began to study hard at the age of twenty-seven, and finally became a great scholar, we can also see that even if a person did not show special talent when young, and started relatively late, as long as he studies hard, he can still achieve something. We usually say "great talents mature late", which has a certain truth. Everyone has some ability in one aspect, and there is no one who lacks ability in everything; it's just that some people mature early and some mature late, but regardless of whether they mature early or late, they must go through hard study and labor to bloom the flower of genius and bear fruitful results.
　　From the perspective of human survival and struggle against nature, the display of human talent is nothing more than a manifestation of striving for freedom. And so-called freedom is the recognition of necessity. People can only understand the laws of nature and society through the practice of production struggle and class struggle. Once anyone is divorced from the practice of social life, divorced from reality, divorced from labor, talent loses its meaning. Therefore, if a person wants to live meaningfully, he must love labor, love life, and love the cause he is engaged in. This high degree of love for the cause is the most important factor in developing talent. Gorky said in a letter to a young writer: "Genius grows out of enthusiasm for work. It can even be said that so-called genius is essentially nothing more than a kind of 'love' for work, for the work process." Therefore, he repeatedly exhorted young writers to love life, to be in the "chaos of life," to understand "all the currents of life, all the trickles of the currents, all the contradictions of reality, the tragedy of reality, heroism and vulgarity, hypocrisy and truth"; conversely, if you are outside of life, it is tantamount to "plundering your own" talent. Herzen also had such a personal experience. He believes that everyone has the talent to master science, but in order for science to "germinate and grow in everyone," it must "exhaust the mind and blood, cry dry tears, be immersed in skepticism and become weak and thin, pity, love, love and dedicate everything to the truth. This is the lyric poetry that cultivates scientific interest." He advised beginners that they should treat science and truth as a matter of life and death, like Belinsky, and let it penetrate into their hearts, so that science can "become struggle, pain and great happiness."
　　Of course, in order to smoothly develop one's talent, and to enable talent to be used in the right place, one must also have a correct worldview and methodology. We also often see that some young people, when starting a certain activity, show a certain ability, but due to the wrong worldview and methodology, especially with individualistic ideology, they finally embark on the wrong path, so that their talent cannot be used in the right place. Wang Yangming of the Ming Dynasty wanted to test the method of "extending knowledge through investigating things", so he sat in front of the bamboo for seven days with his head down, and as a result, he gained nothing, but instead "caused illness due to excessive thinking"; and from this he drew a wrong conclusion:
　　"Then I knew that there was nothing in the world that could be investigated, and the work of investigating things only lies in the body and mind." This is his "extending conscience", that is, the subjective idealism of "all things are prepared in me". Wang Yangming was an idealist, and his method was wrong from the beginning. He only "thought" and did not practice, did not explore the truth from objective practice, but confined his talent in his brain, naturally he could not find the truth, nor could he avoid drawing wrong conclusions. From this it can be seen how important a correct worldview and methodology are for developing and using talent. Marxist dialectical materialism gives people a key to explore the mysteries of the objective world. We should correctly learn and use it to make our talents embark on the road of correct development.
　　In summary, talent is formed and developed in the process of life, in persistent and unremitting diligence. A person needs to go through a long period of hard struggle to acquire talent, not easily and quickly. In this sense, Marx said: "Time is the arena for the development of abilities and so on." As the saying goes: "It takes more than one day for the ice to freeze three feet deep"; as long as you study diligently and well, and love life and labor, talent will continue to be improved and developed. Those who worry about their lack of talent and feel discouraged are only intentionally or unintentionally finding an excuse for laziness, not knowing that "only lazy people are without genius" (Ostrovsky). And those who are afraid of burying their talents in labor are just decorating the idea of ​​being afraid of labor. It must be known that the socialist era is an era of geniuses. This is because the development of genius, as Marx said, depends on the needs of society, and this need depends on the division of labor and the educational conditions caused by the division of labor. Marx pointed out in "Das Kapital" when talking about labor and education, that the old education system and division of labor system must be abolished, because this education and division of labor that separates education and labor will "produce morbid obesity at one extreme of society, and morbid thinness at the other extreme of society." That is to say, it will cause one-sided and deformed development between mental and physical laborers. Marx quoted an economist as saying: "Learning without labor is no better than learning without labor... The lamp of life is fueled by labor, and thought is the act of using the oil." But while Marx explained that the old division of labor and education system must be abolished, he also emphasized: After the working class seizes power, it will solve the problem of combining labor and education in theory and practice, and transform the "partial individual who only bears the burden of a social part function" into "a fully developed individual who uses different social functions as mutually replaceable activities." We know that socialist labor, especially the labor of future communism, is a highly productive skilled labor, requiring people with high technical skills, using both hands and brains, and fully developing their talents to undertake it; and the socialist system creates very favorable educational conditions for training such people, creating conditions for fully and fully developing personality, giving play to physical and mental talents. Being in such an era, it is precisely "the sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly", and everyone can fully and freely develop their personality and talents. Therefore, each of us should study hard, display our ambitions, and contribute our talents to society.

　　谈才能与学习
　　——读书笔记
　　湍音
    有一些传记文章，似乎特别着重于炫示古人的“天资聪颖”，“过目成诵”，五岁诵经书，七岁成诗文，等等。这些，当做一种历史事实的记载，原无谈论的必要。不过，听说有许多青年学生读了这些名人传记之后，不是得到鼓舞和启发，而是大大泄气，觉得自己已经十多岁或二十多岁了，还没有特出的才能表现出来，大概自己此生是决不可能有什么成就和贡献的了。传记所起的这种客观效果，值得引起传记作者们深刻的注意。我以为，他们可以叙述名人们的天资如何如何，但更重要的应该是叙述名人们的才能得以发展，因而取得成功的其他条件，即人们可以了解、可以学习的方面。不这样，就会把个人的才能变成一种神秘莫测的东西。这除了使读者自叹无才，灰心丧气以外，不会有什么好的作用。
    谈到才能的问题，人们都熟知马克思的一句名言：“天才就是勤奋”。这是马克思的切身经验。这就是说，天才并不是什么神秘的东西。正常的人，只要在正确的方向下，进行顽强的努力，都可以从某些方面获得并发展自己的能力。
    当然，谁也不会否认，人们的天然禀赋，即所谓解剖生理特点，各有差异，有高有低。的确，有些人很小的时候，就在某一方面有过人的智慧，对某一方面的活动（如音乐、绘画、诗文等等）表现出了优异的禀赋。如贝多芬四岁就会弹钢琴，列平、苏里科夫等四、五岁时就显露出了绘画的能力。我国古代的诗人曹植、王粲、王勃等等，也都是在年少时就表现出了特出的才能。我们知道，两年前吉林省有一个五岁的小孩会拉胡琴，广州有一个四岁的小孩会弹钢琴。同时，也不可忽视，人们对于某一方面的能力的发展，有的人比较容易而迅速，有的迟钝而吃力，有的长于形象思维，有的长于逻辑思维。这种差异，并不奇怪。根据巴甫洛夫两种信号系统学说的解释，这是因为人的神经中枢的两种信号系统，彼此可能处于不同的关系中，可能是平衡发展的，也可能是第一信号系统比第二信号系统占相对的优势，或则相反。因而，人的高级神经活动，可以分为艺术型、思维型、中间型三种。这种神经类型的自然的特点，是人的能力发展的一种天然的条件。
    这种天然的条件，即先天的禀赋，是人人都具有的，或者是这一方面，或者是那一方面。同时，一个人具有某一方面可以发展的天然条件，其本身并不就是才能。关于才能的问题，必须从历史唯物主义的观点来看待：没有抽象的一般的才能，任何人的才能都是一定的历史的和社会需要的产物。一切历史上的天才人物，都只能作为历史的人物来看待。对才能起决定作用的，只能是社会环境的影响，个人的主观努力等等。天赋才能必须和社会需要、劳动和生活结合起来，才能发挥它的作用，才能实现。任何具有非凡天赋的人，如果像鲁宾逊一样飘流在脱离社会生活的孤岛上，就很难成为天才，而不过是“小时了了，大未必奇”。同时，人的解剖生理和神经结构的某些先天的特性，并不是绝对不变的。据巴甫洛夫说，高级神经系统除了先天的特性外，还有一种最高级的可塑性。某种信号系统占相对优势的人，并不是永远只能朝着一个方面发展，在生活条件的影响下，原来不发达的特性和能力也可以发展起来；因为任何一种活动，都是需要结合使用许多种能力才能完成的。这就是说，社会环境对于人的能力的形成和发展，有着决定性的影响。任何才能的形成和发展，都是刻苦学习和坚韧地致力于某项活动的结果。
    试看古今中外伟大的天才人物，莫不是在具有一定的天赋的条件下，经过了刻苦的学习和磨炼，而后才成大器的。
    拿马克思来说，他对人类的伟大的贡献，就是他毕生勤奋钻研、斗争的结果。据说他有很多年每天都在伦敦大不列颠博物院图书馆里工作十小时，在家里又继续工作到深夜。他读过一千五百多种书籍，做提纲，写内容提要和笔记，单是这些，就可以编成许多巨册。现代的一切科学，如哲学、历史、经济学、自然科学、法律学、数学、化学等等，他都用极大的钻研精神进行研究，直到完全了解为止。马克思的女儿要他说出他最喜爱的格言，他说了一句古拉丁谚语：“人类的一切东西，对于我都不是陌生的。”
    经历过马克思走过的这样的道路而成为伟大天才人物的，举不胜举。贝多芬虽然四岁就在音乐方面表现出了非凡的能力，但若不是从四岁起就被他父亲严格管教他勤学苦练，未必会有以后那样高度的发展。巴甫洛夫也以他做学问的体会，劝告想攀登科学高峰的青年们，要“从一开始工作起，就得在集聚知识方面养成循序渐进的习惯”，要花费艰苦的劳动，而决不要侥幸求成。
    我国人民把诸葛亮看做是智慧的化身，而诸葛亮在“诫子书”里说：“夫学须静也，才须学也：非学无以广才，非志无以成学；慆慢则不能励精，险躁则不能治性。”这就是说，要想成为天才，就得努力学习，如不学习，就是有点才分，也不能把这才分发扬光大。切不可恃才而不学。我们平常只是看到和羡慕诸葛亮智慧很高的一面，岂不知他是在勤学之后才获得了和发展了自己的智慧的。从苏恂二十七岁才发奋求学，后来终于成为大学问家的例子，我们还可以看出，一个人纵然少时并未显露出特殊的天才，而且开始得较晚，只要艰苦学习，也能有所成就的。我们平常说“大器晚成”，是有一定道理的。任何人都具有某一方面的能力，对于任何事情都缺乏能力的人是没有的；只不过有些人早熟，有些人晚成，但不论早熟或晚成，都必须经过艰苦的学习和劳动，才能开出天才之花，结出丰硕之果。
    从人类自身的生存和向大自然斗争的意义上说，人类的才能的发挥，无非是争得自由的表现。而所谓自由，也就是对于必然性的认识。人们要认识自然界和社会的规律，只有通过生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践才有可能。任何人一旦脱离了社会生活的实践，脱离了实际，脱离了劳动，才能就失去了它的意义。因此，一个人要想活得有意义，必须热爱劳动，热爱生活，热爱自己所从事的事业。这种对事业的高度的热爱，正是发展才能的最重要的因素。高尔基在给一个青年作家的信中说道：“天才是从对于工作的热情中成长起来的。甚至可以说，所谓天才，本质上不过是对于工作、对于工作过程的一种‘爱’而已。”因此，他屡次谆谆地劝导青年作家要热爱生活，处在“生活的浑沌之中”，了解“生活的一切川流，川流的一切细流，现实的一切的矛盾，现实的悲剧，英雄主义和庸俗性，虚伪和真实”；反之，如果处身于生活之外，无异于“掠夺自己”的才能。赫尔岑也有过这样的切身体验。他认为每个人都有掌握科学的才能，但要使科学“在每一个人的身上发芽和成长”，必须“熬尽心血，哭干眼泪，沉溺于怀疑主义而筋衰骨瘦，怜惜，爱，热爱以及把一切献给真理。这就是培养科学兴趣的抒情诗。”他劝告初学者，应该把科学和真理，像伯林斯基那样当成生与死的问题，让它深入到自己的心灵中，如此才能使科学“成为斗争、苦痛和巨大的幸福。”
    当然，要想顺利地发展自己的才能，并使才能发挥到正当的地方，还必须具有正确的世界观和思想方法。我们还常常看到有一些青年人，在开始某一项活动的时候，崭露出了一定的能力，但由于世界观和思想方法不对头，特别是具有个人主义的思想意识，而终于走上了错误的道路，使自己的才能发挥不到正当的地方。明朝的王阳明想试验一下“致知在格物”的方法，于是在竹子前闷头闷脑的坐了七天，结果一无所得，反而“劳思致疾”；并由此得出一个错误的结论：
  “乃知天下之物本无可格者，其格物之功只在身心上做。”这就是他所主张的“致良知”，亦即所谓“万物皆备于我”的主观唯心主义的思想。王阳明是一个唯心主义者，方法自不对头，只“劳思”而不实践，不从客观实践中探索真理，而将自己的才能固封于脑壳之中，自然不能找到真理，也不能不得出错误的结论。于此可见，正确的世界观和方法论，对于发展才能和使用才能，是多么的重要。马克思主义的辩证唯物主义，给人们一把探求客观世界奥秘的钥匙，我们应当正确地学习和使用它，使自己的才能走上正确发展的道路。
    综上所述，才能是在生活过程中，在经久不懈的勤奋之中形成和发展起来的。一个人要获得才能，是要经过长时期艰苦奋斗的，不是轻易的和速成的。在这个意义上，马克思说过：“时间便是能力等等的发展的地盘”。俗话说：“冰冻三尺，非一日之寒”；只要勤学善学，热爱生活和劳动，才能就会不断地得到提高和发展。那些耽心自己没有才能而灰心丧志的人，只不过是有意无意地为懒惰找到一种遁词，岂不知，“只有懒汉才是无天才的”（奥斯特洛夫斯基语）。而那种怕在劳动中埋没天才的人，也不过是为怕劳动的思想装璜一下门面而已。要知道，社会主义的时代，是天才辈出的时代。这是因为，天才的发展，正如马克思所说的，取决于社会的需要，而这种需要，又取决于劳动分工以及由劳动分工所造成的教育条件。马克思在“资本论”中谈到劳动和教育问题时也曾指出，旧式的教育制度和分工制度必须废止，因为这种教育和劳动相脱离的教育和分工，会“在社会的一极端，生出了病态的肥大，在社会的另一极端，生出了病态的瘦小。”也就是说，它会在脑力劳动者和体力劳动者之间，分别造成片面畸形的发展。马克思借引一个经济学家的话说：“不劳动的学习，比之学习而不劳动，不会是更好的。……生命的灯，依劳动而加油，思想就是将油点用。”但马克思在说明旧式的分工和教育制度必须废止的同时，又强调指出：工人阶级夺得政权以后，会在理论方面和实用方面，解决劳动和教育结合的问题，把“只当作一个社会部分机能负担者的部分个人”，变为“一个完全发展的，把不同社会机能当作互相替换的活动方法来做的个人”。我们知道，社会主义社会的劳动，特别是未来的共产主义的劳动，是一种生产率很高的熟练劳动，要求具有高度技术水平、手脑并用、全面发展自己才能的人来担任；而社会主义制度，又为培养这样的人创造了十分有利的教育条件，创造了全面而充分地发展个性、发挥体力才能和智力才能的条件。处在这样的时代，正是“海阔凭鱼跃，天空任鸟飞”，人人都可以完全自由而充分地发挥自己的个性与才能。因此我们每个人都应当勤学苦练，施展抱负，为社会贡献出自己的才能。
