　　On the Usage of the Character "Nai"
　　Wang Nianyi
    Comrade Dong Ming wrote in his article "'Jia Yi,' 'Yu Yi,' and Others": "Some people particularly like the expression 'nai shi,' but this is incorrect. 'Nai' is 'shi,' and 'shi' is 'nai'..." This is not right.

    The most common meaning of "nai" is "therefore" or "then," which in colloquial terms is "jiu" or "this is when."

    "Nai" also has a usage similar to "shi," such as in "Water Margin is a remarkable book of its time." In fact, this "nai" is still an adverb. Classical Chinese does not have a copula equivalent to the "shi" in colloquial Chinese. We now say "Confucius is a person from the State of Lu," but in ancient times, it was sufficient to say "Confucius, a person from Lu, ye"; if it were said "Confucius nai a person from Lu, ye," it would have a tone of clarification or affirmation, implying something like "not a person from Qi." Therefore, if the sentence is translated into colloquial Chinese, some people feel that one "shi" is not enough and want to use "nai shi." However, it is better for writing to be colloquial. Rather than using "nai shi," it is better to use "jiu shi."

### 关于“乃”字的用法

　　关于“乃”字的用法
　　王年一
    东明同志写的“‘加以’‘予以’及其他”一文里说：“有些人特别喜欢
  ‘乃是’这个字眼，但这是不通的。乃就是是，是就是乃……”这话不对。
    “乃”字最普通的意义是“于是”或“然后”，用白话说是“就”或“这才”。
    “乃”也有类似“是”的用法，如“水浒乃一代奇书。”其实这个“乃”字仍是副词。文言里没有和白话的“是”字相当的系词，我们现在说“孔子是鲁国人”，古时只要说“孔子，鲁人也”；若是说“孔子乃鲁人也”，就有辨白或申明的口气，言下有“非齐人也”之类的意思在。因此，句子若是翻成白话，有人觉得一个“是”字不够，要用“乃是”。不过，文章还是口语化的好。与其用“乃是”，不如用“就是”。
