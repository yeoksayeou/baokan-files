Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Beijing sanitation workers, at a competition rally held today, resolved to further improve environmental sanitation to ensure the capital's cleanliness and the people's health.

The capital's sanitation workers are the vanguards in improving urban environmental sanitation. During the Great Leap Forward, they were full of energy, setting out every midnight to transport thousands of tons of garbage and manure out of the city before dawn, sending it to the people's communes in the suburbs as fertilizer. Street sweepers, who used to clean only four to five thousand square meters of ground per shift, can now clean up to ten thousand square meters per shift while ensuring cleanliness. The cleaning work in public toilets throughout the city has also been strengthened, with each toilet generally cleaned two to three times a day.

At the competition rally, representatives of sanitation workers from garbage loading and unloading teams, manure removal teams, street cleaning teams, and public toilet and sewage pool maintenance teams enthusiastically engaged in the competition. They challenged and responded to each other, putting forward the battle cry of "Vigorously promote environmental sanitation, sanitation workers take the lead," determined to build on the achievements already made, advance victoriously, and resolutely achieve the following: First, in garbage transportation work, vehicles must be dispatched on time, collected and transported on time, and swept clean. Regardless of rain or shine, ensure that as much as there is will be transported, without missing a single box. Second, in manure collection and transportation work, it must be emptied and swept clean, without splashing or spilling, without overtime, without missing any doors, collected on time, without losing a single vehicle. Third, the main roads must be kept clean, free of fruit peels and scraps, and floating soil swept away promptly after rain, and horse manure left on the road removed. Fourth, public toilets and sewage pools must be free of mosquitoes and flies, the inside and outside of the toilets must be clean, and medications sprayed regularly. In addition, environmental sanitation management must be strengthened to ensure that the capital is clean and tidy everywhere.

Cui Yueli, Director of the Health and Sports Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointing out that sanitation workers have done a lot of work in maintaining the capital's environmental sanitation and have achieved great results. However, due to the gradual increase in the capital's population and the recent heavy rainfall, the sanitation workers' tasks are still very arduous. He called on all sanitation workers in the city to continue to exert their energy, to make the capital more clean and beautiful, and to present more outstanding achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

　　把首都打扮得更加整洁美丽
　　北京清洁工人比干劲
    新华社19日讯　首都清洁工人在今天举行的竞赛大会上，决定进一步搞好环境卫生，确保首都清洁和人民健康。
    首都的清洁工人是搞好城市环境卫生的尖兵。他们在大跃进中干劲十足，每天午夜出动，要赶在天亮以前，把全城几千吨垃圾和粪便赶运出城，送给郊区的人民公社做肥料。清扫街道的工人过去每人每班只能扫四、五千平方米的地面，现在在保证扫得干净的前提下，每人每班最高能够清扫一万平方米的地面。全市公共厕所的保洁工作也加强了，每个厕所每天一般都要清扫两至三次。
    竞赛大会上，垃圾装卸队、粪便清除队、街道清扫专业队和公共厕所、污水池养修专业队的清洁工人代表们热烈地展开了竞赛，他们相互挑战应战，提出了“大搞环境卫生，清洁工人打冲锋”的战斗口号，决心在已经取得的成绩的基础上，乘胜前进，坚决做到：一、垃圾运输工作，按时出车，按时收运，运完扫净，不管雨天、晴天，都保证有多少运多少，不漏掉一箱；二、粪便的收运工作，要掏完扫净，不溅不洒，不压班，不漏门，按时掏取，不丢掉一车；三、各条干路路面清洁，无瓜果皮屑，雨后及时扫净浮土，清除路面遗落的马粪；四、公共厕所和污水池没有蚊蝇，厕所内外清洁，定期喷洒药物。此外，还要加强环境卫生管理，保证首都到处都整洁、干净。
    中共北京市委卫生体育部部长崔月犁代表中共北京市委在会上向清洁工人们讲了话，指出清洁工人在保持首都环境卫生方面做了许多工作，成绩很大。但是由于首都人口逐渐增加，最近雨水又多，清洁工人的任务仍然十分艰巨。他号召全市清洁工人们继续鼓足干劲，把首都打扮得更加整洁美丽，拿出更出色的成绩来迎接国庆十周年。（附图片）
