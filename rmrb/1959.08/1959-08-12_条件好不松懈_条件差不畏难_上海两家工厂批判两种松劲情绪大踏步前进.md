Shanghai, August 11th (reported by this newspaper) - Two factories in Shanghai – the Shanghai Boiler Factory and the Zuming Iron Factory – one because some cadres were complacent, believing that the second half of the year's plan could be completed without much effort; the other because the plan had not been completed month after month in the first half of the year, and the task for the second half of the year was heavy, with some cadres being daunted and slackening, unable to break the deadlock. Both situations, one kind of mood, seriously hindered the leap forward in production. However, after the Party organization carried out situation education, conducted criticism, and greatly encouraged enthusiasm, the people in the factory immediately became motivated, and the pace of the production leap forward greatly accelerated.

The output value of the Shanghai Boiler Factory in the first half of the year increased by more than double compared with the same period last year, and the quality has also been greatly improved. At the end of June, some cadres believed that the task for the second half of the year could be "confidently" completed without much effort. The Party Committee analyzed this ideological situation, believing that this was due to the unclear understanding of the current favorable situation by some cadres and workers, and the insufficient understanding of the complexity and arduousness of this year's tasks. Failure to eliminate this ideological mood would be very harmful to completing this year's leap forward plan. In mid-July, the factory held a workers' representative meeting to conduct extensive discussions and debates on this issue. At the representatives' meeting, the issue of whether the plan for the second half of the year was a leap forward plan was resolved by carefully calculating accounts and presenting facts. The accounting results showed that compared with last year's actual performance, this year's indicators showed an increase of 27.6% in boiler evaporation (i.e., total boiler output) and more than double in power generation (because larger boilers increased more this year). Comparing the task for the second half of the year with the first half of the year, evaporation increased by 50%, and power generation increased by more than double. Taking power station boilers with higher technical requirements as an example, the output in the second half of the year will increase by about 50% to 100% compared with the whole of last year. This aspect needs to be further addressed by taking further measures to overcome the many technical difficulties brought about by the new tasks. The debate showed that this implemented plan was by no means a plan that could be "confidently" completed without full effort; on the contrary, it required redoubled efforts to carry out technical innovation in order to create conditions, strive for high yield and high quality, and complete the task for the second half of the year.

The debate turned around the paralysis and slackening thinking of these cadres, and they recognized the situation in the second half of the year. "Not to mention that the task in the second half of the year is heavy and complacency is not allowed, even if the task is not heavy, we cannot relax, we should try every means to produce more things to support the national leap forward." As soon as the ideological understanding was improved, people immediately took action and actively looked for measures and ways to deal with the tasks in the second half of the year. In order to ensure the completion of products and improve product quality, they have decided to take back the tasks of furnace grate pieces, valves, etc., which were originally outsourced for cooperation, and produce them themselves. In addition, they are also preparing to make their own steel pouring equipment, expand the production of coking materials and pipe drawing, and strengthen the maintenance and repair of equipment. Recently, the entire factory has put forward more than 500 measures to improve production. After preliminary accounting, some of these measures can reduce product costs by 8% after implementation. A team composed of factory leaders, technicians, and workers is launching activities with the rectification of technology as the center. On the basis of ensuring quality, they have modified some designs, among which each medium-pressure boiler can save about 35 tons of steel.

The other factory is the Zuming Iron Factory. At the beginning of this year, the state required this factory to gradually transition from producing small steam engines to producing large air compressors. To complete this task, there were indeed some difficulties in terms of equipment and technology. However, the leading cadres stagnated in the face of difficulties, and the production plan for the first quarter was not completed. In April, a 200-horsepower air compressor was successfully trial-produced, and the supply of raw materials was basically guaranteed. However, a mood of fear of difficulties and slackening permeated the entire factory. The leading cadres still emphasized the difficulties such as the large size and precision of the products, the poor machine tool equipment, and the lack of technical strength. As a result, the plan was not completed for six consecutive months in the first half of the year. After the counterpart inspection and comparison of the city's same industry at the end of June, the leading cadres of this factory found that the difficulties of the brother factories were even greater, and in comparison, their own factory was greatly lagging behind. In early July, the factory's Party branch organized cadres above the workshop level to summarize the production in the first half of the year in the spirit of rectification, and at the same time organized production backbones to visit and learn from brother factories; then the factory director also reviewed and criticized the leading cadres' mood of fear of difficulties and slackening at the factory's employee meeting. The cold and desolate situation was quickly reversed. The workers said: "We workers are not afraid of being busy, but only afraid of being idle. As long as the Party calls on us to make a leap forward, we will definitely run forward with full enthusiasm." Since then, the factory director has grasped scheduling every day, and the workshop directors have grasped scheduling shift after shift. Problems occurring in the production process have been solved in a timely manner. Several old workers went to brother factories four times to learn advanced experience in crankshaft processing, which reduced the processing time by more than half. In the production competition, 80% of the workers in the factory completed and exceeded the quotas. In July, the factory's output value, output, and quality all completed or even exceeded the plan.

    条件好不松懈　条件差不畏难
    上海两家工厂批判两种松劲情绪大踏步前进
    本报上海11日电　上海有两个工厂——上海锅炉厂和铸明铁工厂，一个因为部分干部有松劲情绪，认为下半年计划无需多大努力就可完成任务；另一个是上半年月月未完成计划，下半年任务甚重，部分干部畏难松劲，打不开局面。两种情况，一种情绪，严重地阻碍着生产的跃进。但是，经过党组织进行了形势教育，开展了批评，大鼓干劲，厂内的人们立即奋发起来，生产跃进的步伐大大加快了。
    上海锅炉厂上半年产值比去年同期增长一倍以上，质量也有很大改进。6月底，有些干部认为下半年的任务，不需要作很大的努力，就可“笃定”完成。党委会分析了这种思想情况，认为这是由于某些干部和职工对目前有利形势认识不清，对今年任务的复杂性艰巨性认识不足。这种思想情绪不消除，对完成今年跃进计划十分有害。7月中旬厂里召开职工代表大会，就这一问题展开了广泛的讨论和争辩。代表大会上经过算细账、摆事实，先解决下半年的计划是不是跃进计划的认识问题。算账结果表明：今年的指标与去年实绩比较，锅炉蒸发量
  （即锅炉总产量）增长27.6％，发电量增长一倍以上（因今年大型锅炉增长更多）。再以下半年任务与上半年比较，蒸发量增加50％，发电量增加一倍多。以技术要求较高的电站锅炉为例，下半年产量就比去年全年增长五成到一倍左右。这方面还有待于进一步采取措施，以便克服新任务带来的许多技术困难。辩论说明：这个落实的计划绝不是不需鼓足干劲就能“笃定”完成的计划；相反地倒是需要再接再厉大搞技术革新，才能创造条件，力争高产优质，完成下半年任务。
    辩论使这些干部的麻痹松劲思想转了弯，认清了下半年的形势。“别说下半年任务很重，麻痹不得，就是任务不重，也不能松劲，应该千方百计生产更多的东西，支援全国的大跃进”。思想认识一提高，人们立即行动起来，针对下半年的任务，积极找措施想办法去了。为了保证产品成套、提高产品质量，他们已决定把原来外包协作的炉篦片、阀门等任务收回来自己生产。另外，还准备自制浇钢设备、扩大炼焦材料和拉管的生产、加强设备的维护检修工作。最近，全厂已提出五百多条改进生产的措施。其中有些措施经过初步核算，实行后可使产品成本降低8％。由工厂领导、技术人员和工人组成的一支队伍，正以整顿工艺为中心，展开活动。他们在保证质量的基础上，修改了某些设计，其中一种中压锅炉每台即可节约钢材三十五吨左右。
    另一个工厂是铸明铁工厂。今年年初，国家要求这个厂从原来生产小型蒸汽机逐步过渡到生产大型空气压缩机。完成这一任务，设备上、技术上确实存在一些困难。但领导干部在困难面前停滞不前，一季度生产计划没有完成。4月份二百马力空气压缩机试制成功，原材料供应基本上也有保证，但畏难松劲情绪弥漫全厂，领导干部仍强调产品既大又精，机床设备差、技术力量不足等等困难，结果上半年连续六个月都没有完成计划。经过6月底全市同行业的对口检查评比，这个厂的领导干部发现兄弟工厂的困难更多更大，相形之下，自己厂是大大落后了。7月初，厂党支部组织车间以上干部以整风精神总结了上半年生产，同时组织生产骨干到兄弟厂参观学习；接着厂长又在全厂职工大会上检查批判了领导干部的畏难松劲情绪，冷冷清清的局面才很快扭转过来。工人说：“我们工人不怕忙只怕闲，只要党号召我们大跃进，我们就一定鼓足干劲向前跑。”从此，厂长天天抓调度，车间主任班班抓调度，生产过程中发生的问题及时得到解决。几个老工人四次到兄弟厂学习曲轴加工的先进经验，使加工工时缩短一半以上。在生产竞赛中，全厂80％的工人都完成和超过了定额。7月份，全厂产值、产量、质量都完成甚至超额完成了计划。　（赵棣生）
