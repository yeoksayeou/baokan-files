Editor's Note:

    The red flag is the honor of advanced units and the goal of other units. Planting red flags for advanced units is for the sake of the whole, for "a sea of red," and for red light to shine everywhere.

    The Suzhou Prefecture is "classifying and establishing benchmarks to promote progress by classification"; every region has red flags, every crop has red flags, and agricultural and sideline occupations have red flags. Wherever red flags are unfurled, the same region, the same crop, and the same production project will all look to the red flag as a model. Thus, the entire prefecture is bathed in red light, full of hope.

    In this way, competitions and the planting of red flags are not for "picking out the best," but for balance—not balanced at a backward level, not balanced at a static, ordinary level, but striving for balance at a higher level.

### 红光普照

    红光普照
    红旗是先进单位的荣誉，又是其它单位的目标。给先进单位插红旗，是为了全体，为了“满堂红”，为了红光普照。
    苏州专区“分类树标兵，分类大促进”；各个地区都有红旗，各种作物都有红旗，农业副业都有红旗。红旗招展之处，同一地区、同一作物、同一生产项目就都向红旗看齐。于是，全专区一片红光，充满希望。
    这样，竞赛，插红旗，就不是为了“拔尖”，而是为了平衡——不是平衡于落后的水平，不是平衡于静止的一般的水平，而是力争平衡于较高的水平。
