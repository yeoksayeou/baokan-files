　　Bulgaria is utilizing the conditions of its vast agricultural development to raise poultry on a large scale. Chicken farming has already achieved great success. In the first half of this year, more than 25 million chicks have been hatched nationwide, which is 11.47 million more than the total number of chickens in 1958.
    In order to further improve the people's lives, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued a call for vigorous development of chicken farming at its plenary sessions in October and November last year. This call immediately received enthusiastic support from the Bulgarian people. A chicken farming boom has been launched across the country. Chicken farms have been established in agricultural production cooperatives and state farms in various places, and measures have been taken to improve chicken breeds and supply high-quality feed.
    Currently, thousands of large-scale mechanized chicken coops are being built across the country, each of which can raise about 5,000 chickens, while ordinary chicken coops built last year could only raise up to 80 chickens. For example, the poultry farms built in the villages of Gorna Kremena and Dolna Kremena in Dobruja can raise 5,000 hens. They also plan to use the income from chicken farming to build several more such poultry farms in the next five years.
    In addition, many small chicken coops are also being built in various places.
    Bulgarian farmers attach great importance to chicken farming. Raising chicks is a job that requires great patience. Most agricultural cooperatives entrust this work to girls with secondary education.

　　保加利亚养鸡业大发展
　　上半年孵出小鸡二千五百多万只
    本报讯　保加利亚人民利用农业巨大发展的条件，大量饲养家禽。目前养鸡业已获得巨大的成就。今年上半年，全国已经孵出二千五百多万只小鸡，这比1958年全年鸡的总数还多一千零四十七万只。
    为了进一步改善人民生活，保加利亚共产党中央委员会去年10月和11月的全体会议就发出了大力发展养鸡业的号召。这一号召立即得到保加利亚人民的热烈拥护。全国掀起了养鸡的热潮。各地的农业生产合作社和国营农场中都建立了养鸡场，并采取措施改良鸡的品种、供应优良饲料。
    目前，全国各地正建立上千的大型机械化鸡舍，每个鸡舍约能养五千只鸡，而去年建筑的普通鸡舍最多只能养八十只鸡。例如，多布鲁查的戈尔那克列麦纳和多尔那克列麦纳两个村建造的养禽场光母鸡就能养五千只。他们在最近五年内还准备用养鸡的收入再建几个这样的养禽场。
    另外，各地还在建立许多小型鸡舍。
    保加利亚农民对养鸡工作十分重视。养小鸡是一项需要很大耐心的工作。大部分农业社都把这项工作委托给受过中等教育的姑娘。
