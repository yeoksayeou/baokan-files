Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 9th: The steel city of Anshan held a city-wide workers' oath-taking radio rally for increasing production and practicing economy on August 8th. Representatives from various units of Anshan Iron and Steel (Angang) unanimously stated at the meeting that they were determined to oppose right-leaning laxity, summon greater revolutionary vigor, push the high-yield, high-quality, low-cost increase production and practice economy movement to a new peak, work hard for the two months of August and September, and produce more and better steel to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The proposal by workers in the Angang rolling steel system to increase steel production by 100,000 tons as a gift for the 10th anniversary of National Day has been enthusiastically supported by workers in the Angang blast furnace, open hearth furnace, mining, sintering, and chemical systems. Workers in various units have quickly launched a large-scale competition around this central goal. They expressed their determination to mine more ore and produce more coke to ensure that the blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces are well-fed, producing more and better pig iron and steel ingots to support the increased production of steel by the various rolling steel mills. Workers in the steelmaking system put forward a guarantee to increase the production of high-quality steel by 20,000 tons in August and September as a response to the proposal from the rolling steel system. In recent days, new production achievements have continuously emerged in various factories and mines. Five large fixed open hearth furnaces, the Chemical Plant, the Sintering Plant, and the First Slabbing Mill, Medium Mill, Small Mill, First Medium Plate Mill, Second Medium Plate Mill, First Thin Plate Mill, and Second Thin Plate Mill have all exceeded the national production plan for the first week of August by 1% to 36% respectively.

At the radio rally, the first to rush to the podium was Zhang Yue, deputy director of the Angang Ironmaking Plant. He represented all the factory workers in expressing his determination, saying, "We guarantee to the steelmaking plant that we will supply as much molten iron as the open hearth furnaces need, and the pig iron qualification rate will be guaranteed to reach over 97%." He stated that they would continue to promote the advanced experience of simultaneously improving smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, strive to increase blast furnace air temperature, and in the two months of August and September, not only will they produce more pig iron, but they will also strive to save 3,000 tons of coke and reduce costs by 3 million yuan. Subsequently, representatives from the First and Second Steelmaking Plants and five large fixed open hearth furnaces took the stage one after another to express their determination. Zhao Hongyan, vice chairman of the trade union of the Second Steelmaking Plant, represented all the factory workers in expressing his determination, saying, "We must thoroughly carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, maintain the furnace body well, shorten the smelting time, and in the two months of August and September, produce another 10,000 tons of steel for the country." Man Shoutong, the general furnace chief of the No. 23 open hearth furnace, representing the five large fixed open hearth furnaces, expressed his determination, saying: "We must focus on passing the three major hurdles of equipment, furnace body, and safety, thoroughly carry out technical performance competitions, improve technical operating levels, carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, and resolutely work with the First and Second Steelmaking Plants to complete the guarantee conditions for increasing steel production by 20,000 tons, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day." Meng Qingchun, a famous rolling steel expert from the Slabbing Mill, represented all the factory workers in expressing his determination: to realize the proposal to increase steel production by 100,000 tons, we must immediately launch a large-scale production collaboration and competition between factories and between work sections, ensuring sufficient steel billets for all brother rolling steel mills, and ensuring satisfactory quality and specifications. At the meeting, the representative of the Sintering Plant also stated that they would increase the production of concentrate by 10,000 tons in the third quarter to support ironmaking, and guarantee to reduce product costs by 3.5 million yuan.

    为增产十万吨钢材两万吨优质钢而战！
    钢都英雄奋起摆擂比武
    新华社鞍山9日电　钢都鞍山8月8日召开了全市职工增产节约誓师广播大会。鞍钢各单位代表在大会上一致表示，决心反掉右倾松劲情绪，鼓足更大的革命干劲，把高产、优质、低成本的增产节约运动推向新的高峰，大干8、9两个月，生产出更多更好的钢铁，向国庆十周年献礼。
    鞍钢轧钢系统职工提出增产十万吨钢材向国庆十周年献礼的倡议后，已经得到了全鞍钢高炉、平炉、矿山、烧结、化工系统职工的热烈响应。各单位职工围绕着这个中心迅速展开了大竞赛。他们表示决心多采矿石多炼焦，保证高炉、平炉吃饱吃好，生产出更多更好的生铁和钢锭，支援各轧钢厂增产钢材。炼钢系统职工提出了8、9两个月增产两万吨优质钢的保证书，以此条件响应轧钢系统的倡议。连日来，各厂矿不断出现生产新成就。五座大型固定式平炉、化工总厂、烧结总厂和第一初轧、中型、小型、第一中板、第二中板、第一薄板、第二薄板等厂都分别超过1％到36％完成了8月份第一周的国家生产计划。
    在广播大会上，第一个跑上主席台的是鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长张钺。他代表全厂职工表示决心说，我们向炼钢厂保证，平炉要多少铁水，我们就供给多少铁水，生铁合格率保证达到97％以上。他表示，他们将继续推行提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的先进经验，努力提高高炉风温，在8、9两个月里，不仅要生产更多的生铁，而且要力争节约焦炭三千吨，降低成本三百万元。接着，第一、第二炼钢厂和五座大型固定平炉的代表，都先后登台表示决心。第二炼钢厂工会副主席赵洪彦代表全厂职工表示决心说，我们要深入开展技术革新和技术革命，维护好炉体，缩短熔炼时间，8、9两个月，再为国家多生产一万吨钢。五座大型固定式平炉的代表、二十三号平炉总炉长满守桐表示决心说：我们要以过好设备、炉体、安全三大关为中心，深入开展技术表演竞赛，提高技术操作水平，开展增产节约运动，坚决与第一、第二炼钢厂一道完成增产两万吨钢的保证条件，向国庆十周年献礼。初轧厂著名的轧钢能手孟庆春代表全厂职工表示：决心要实现增产十万吨钢材的倡议，立即展开厂与厂、工段与工段的生产大协作大竞赛。保证供应各兄弟轧钢厂足够的钢坯，做到质量满意，规格满意。在会上，烧结总厂的代表也表示要在第三季度内增产一万吨精矿，支援炼铁，并且保证降低产品成本三百五十万元。（附图片）
