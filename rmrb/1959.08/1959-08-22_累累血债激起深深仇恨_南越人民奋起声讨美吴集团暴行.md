Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st: According to reports in local newspapers today, the people of the southwestern region of South Vietnam are adopting various forms of struggle to resist the brutal crimes of the U.S.-Ngô group in persecuting the people.

Since the end of last year, the U.S.-Ngô group has been carrying out brutal "sweeps" in the southwestern region of South Vietnam to suppress the people. According to incomplete statistics, 257 residents have been killed, 508 injured, and 3,250 arrested. These crimes of the U.S.-Ngô group have aroused the anger and resistance of the people.

In March of this year, when Ngô Đình Diệm's troops were conducting "sweeps" in the southwestern region, many farmers from Kim Oanh Province went to Saigon in groups to accuse the U.S.-Ngô group of their evil deeds. Upon arriving in Saigon, the farmers from Kim Oanh Province sent representatives to accuse the U.S.-Ngô group of their crimes to more than 300 representatives attending the Workers' Union Representative Conference of Southern Provinces. After hearing the report, the representatives passed a resolution protesting the U.S.-Ngô group's policy of persecution and massacre of the people.

In May of this year, Ngô Đình Diệm's troops gang-raped and killed Ah Lai, a young girl from Đông An township in District of Dishí, and threw her body into the river. More than 400 local residents held a demonstration and wrote 80 jointly-signed letters of accusation, protesting this beastly act of the U.S.-Ngô group.

When Ngô Đình Diệm's troops were conducting "sweeps" in Long Mỹ County, they destroyed the people's houses and grain, and forced more than 10,000 households in one township to concentrate in one area. However, due to the resolute opposition of the local residents, only about 80 households have been concentrated so far.

According to Saigon newspapers, the people of the southwestern region have eradicated many officials of the Ngô Đình Diệm group who have massacred the people and owe mountains of blood debts. The county chiefs of Ô Môn, Thời Bình, and Đơn Nha counties, and the branch captain of the Phụng Hiệp public security team were killed by the people. As a result, personnel of the Ngô Đình Diệm regime in many areas are very panicked. Even Ngô Đình Diệm and the American military advisors have had to admit that their "sweeps" are facing failure.

　　累累血债激起深深仇恨
    南越人民奋起声讨美吴集团暴行
    新华社河内21日电　据此间报纸今天报道，南越南部西面地区人民采取各种斗争方式反抗美吴集团残害人民的暴行。
    美吴集团从去年年底就开始在南越南部西面地区进行残暴的“扫荡”，镇压人民。据不完全的统计，被杀害的居民达二百五十七人，受伤的有五百零八人，被捕的有三千二百五十人。美吴集团的这种暴行激起了人民的愤怒和反抗。
    今年3月间，当吴庭艳的军队在西面地区“扫荡”的时候，金瓯省许多农民成群结队地到西贡去控告美吴集团的恶行。在到达西贡的时候，金瓯省农民派出了代表向参加南方各省工会代表会议的三百多名代表控诉了美吴集团的暴行。代表们听了报告以后，通过决议抗议美吴集团的迫害和残杀人民的政策。
    今年5月，吴庭艳军队轮奸和杀死了迪石省东安乡的少女阿莱，并且把她的尸体抛进河里。当地居民四百多人举行了示威，并且写了八十封联名控告信，抗议美吴集团的这种兽行。
    吴庭艳的军队在隆美县“扫荡”时，摧毁了人民的房屋和粮食，并且强迫一个乡的一万多户居民集中在一个地区。但是由于当地居民的坚决反对，至今仅仅集中了约八十户居民。
    据西贡报纸报道，南部西面地区的人民铲除了许多残杀人民、血债累累的吴庭艳集团的官员。乌门、时平、顿涯等县的县长和凤合公安队支队长就是被人民打死的。因此，许多地区的吴庭艳政权的人员非常惊慌。连吴庭艳和美国军事顾问也不得不承认他们的“扫荡”面临失败。（附图片）
