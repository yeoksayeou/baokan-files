Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st: The Soviet Union has adopted the method of establishing specialized bases for the production of subsidiary foods such as vegetables and potatoes around large cities and industrial and mining areas, greatly increasing the supply of subsidiary foods such as vegetables and potatoes for urban and industrial and mining area residents.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has paid more attention to developing the production of vegetables and potatoes around cities and industrial and mining areas. Following the special issuance by the Central Committee of the CPSU of the "Decision on Organizing Specialized State Farms in the Moscow Region to Ensure the Supply of Vegetables and Potatoes to Residents of Moscow," the Russian Federation Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation also adopted decisions to ensure the supply of vegetables and potatoes to cities such as Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Gorky, Kuibyshev, and Chelyabinsk. The Central Committees and Councils of Ministers of the Ukrainian, Belorussian, Moldavian, Latvian, and Georgian Republics have all issued special decisions in this regard, formulating a series of specific measures.

Currently, bases for the production of subsidiary foods such as vegetables, potatoes, milk, and meat have gradually formed in various large cities and industrial and mining centers. For example, near Moscow, in addition to state farms and collective farms that focus on vegetable production, thirty-five state farms have been designated to engage in subsidiary food production. Specialized bases for the production of vegetables and potatoes have also been established around Leningrad, the capitals of various republics, and industrial and mining cities.

These state farms, whose central task is to supply cities with vegetables and potatoes, are specialized on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are still diversified. These state farms link the production of vegetables and potatoes with the development of animal husbandry. Livestock manure is a good fertilizer for cultivating vegetables and potatoes. The development of the vegetable and potato industry can provide a large amount of valuable feed for raising livestock. For example, the Bolshevik State Farm near Moscow is divided into five specialized departments. Two departments specialize in vegetable production, covering an area of ​​1,200 hectares; one department produces potatoes; and the other two departments specialize in livestock breeding. These departments coordinate production and promote each other.

Establishing specialized bases for the production of vegetables and potatoes near cities can ensure the supply of fresh vegetables to cities, reduce losses due to transportation and spoilage, and lower costs.

As a result of establishing specialized bases for the production of vegetables and potatoes, the total output of vegetables and potatoes in the Soviet Union has increased greatly every year.

If the average annual potato output from 1949 to 1953 was 75.7 million tons and vegetables were 10 million tons, then the average annual potato output from 1954 to 1958 increased to 83.3 million tons, and vegetable output increased to 13.9 million tons. The state's procurement of potatoes and vegetables and the supply to urban residents have both increased significantly. Now, the Soviet Union has the largest potato planting area in the world, and its output accounts for about 40% of the world's total potato output.

In increasing the supply of vegetables and potatoes to cities and industrial and mining areas, the Soviet Union also pays great attention to eliminating the seasonality of vegetable supply and ensuring that there are fresh vegetables all year round. The measures taken in various places are to increase the variety of vegetables and to do a good job in preserving vegetables and potatoes. In recent years, scientific research institutions have successively researched some methods for preserving vegetables. Many warehouses for preserving vegetables have also been built in various places.

    保证蔬菜肉类源源供应
    苏城市工矿区建立副食品基地
    据新华社莫斯科31日电　苏联采取在大城市周围以及工矿区周围建立专门的生产蔬菜、马铃薯等副食品基地的方法，使城市和工矿区居民的蔬菜、马铃薯等副食品的供应量大增。
    最近几年来，苏联一直就比较注意在城市和工矿区周围发展蔬菜和马铃薯的生产。继苏共中央专门发布了“关于在莫斯科州组织专门国营农场以保证供应莫斯科市居民蔬菜和马铃薯的决定”之后，苏共中央俄罗斯联邦局和俄罗斯联邦部长会议也通过了保证供应列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、高尔基、古比雪夫、车里雅宾斯克等城市蔬菜和马铃薯的决定。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚、格鲁吉亚等共和国的党中央和部长会议都在这方面发布了专门的决定，拟定了一系列具体的措施。
    目前，生产蔬菜、马铃薯以及牛奶、肉类等副食品的基地已经逐渐在各个大城市和工矿中心形成。例如在莫斯科附近，除了国营农场和集体农庄都偏重蔬菜生产外，还划定了三十五个国营农场从事副食品生产。列宁格勒、各共和国首都和工矿城市的周围也都建立了专门生产蔬菜和马铃薯的基地。
    这些以供应城市蔬菜、马铃薯为中心任务的国营农场一方面是专门化了的，但另一方面也仍然是多种经营。这些国营农场把生产蔬菜、马铃薯和发展畜牧业联系了起来。牲畜的粪便是栽培蔬菜、马铃薯的良好肥料。而蔬菜、马铃薯业发展的结果又能给饲养牲畜提供大量的极有价值的饲料。例如莫斯科附近的布尔什维克国营农场共分成五个专业化的部门。两个部门专门生产蔬菜，占地一千二百公顷，一个部门是生产马铃薯，另外两个部门专门经营饲畜业。这几个部门协调生产，互相促进。
    在城市附近建立专门生产蔬菜、马铃薯的基地，能保证供应城市新鲜蔬菜，可以减少由于运输、腐烂而造成的损失和降低成本。
    由于建立专门的生产蔬菜、马铃薯基地的结果，苏联蔬菜、马铃薯的总产量每年大增。
    如果从1949年到1953年每年平均的马铃薯产量是七千五百七十万吨，蔬菜是一千万吨，那么从1954年到1958年平均每年马铃薯产量就增为八千三百三十万吨，蔬菜产量增为一千三百九十万吨。国家对马铃薯和蔬菜的采购量及对城市居民的供应量都大大增加。现在，苏联马铃薯播种面积占世界第一位，产量约占全世界马铃薯总产量的40％。
    在增加对城市和工矿区蔬菜和马铃薯的供应中，苏联各地还非常注意消灭蔬菜供应的季节性，保证成年都有新鲜蔬菜。各地所采取的措施一是增加蔬菜品种，其次是作好蔬菜、马铃薯的保存工作。科学研究机关最近几年来陆续研究出了一些保存蔬菜的方法。各地还修建了许多保存蔬菜的仓库。
