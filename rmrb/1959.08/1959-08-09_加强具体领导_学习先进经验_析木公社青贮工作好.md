Strengthen Specific Leadership, Learn from Advanced Experience
Analy Village Commune Does a Good Job in Silage Work

(By our newspaper) The Analy People's Commune in Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, mobilized all its members to seize the season of summer green to vigorously engage in silage feed production. From July 13th to 22nd alone, in just ten days, they silaged 403 cellars of potato (Solanum tuberosum) vines and 30 cellars of wild grass and vegetables, totaling more than 4 million jin, enough to feed all 17,000 pigs in the entire commune for 20 days.

The Analy Commune Party Committee attached great importance to this year's large-scale silage feed production. At the Party Committee meeting, they summarized the experiences and lessons from last year and deployed this year's silage work, criticizing the incorrect perceptions of some cadres who feared trouble and worried that pigs would not like to eat it and would not gain weight. In order to further make everyone aware of the benefits of silage, the Commune Party Committee also organized everyone to study the experience of the Lao Dabu Brigade in silage production last year. The silage feed produced by the Lao Dabu Brigade last year has not yet been completely fed.

After carrying out this work, the entire commune immediately launched a high tide of silage feed production centered on large-scale potato vine silage. Every day, more than 16,000 people went up the mountains and down to the fields to pick up potato vines and collect wild grasses and vegetables. The Dabaihu Brigade dug seven cellars in one day, all of which were filled with green fodder.

    加强具体领导  学习先进经验
    析木公社青贮工作好
    本报讯　辽宁海城县析木人民公社发动全体社员，紧紧抓住夏青季节大搞青贮饲料。仅从7月13日到22日十天时间就青贮了土豆（马铃薯）秧四百零三窖，野草、野菜三十窖，共四百多万斤，够全公社一万七千口猪吃二十天。
    析木公社党委对今年大搞青贮饲料工作非常重视，在党委会议上总结了去年的经验教训，布置了今年青贮工作，批判了某些干部怕麻烦、怕猪不爱吃不能长肉等不正确认识。为了使大家进一步认识青贮的好处，公社党委还组织大家学习了老达卜大队去年青贮的经验。老达卜大队去年青贮的饲料，到现在还没有喂完。
    在作了这些工作以后，全公社立即掀起了以大搞土豆秧为中心的青贮饲料高潮。每天有一万六千多人上山下地拣土豆秧和采集野草野菜。打白虎大队一天时间就挖了七个窖，全部都贮满了青饲料。
