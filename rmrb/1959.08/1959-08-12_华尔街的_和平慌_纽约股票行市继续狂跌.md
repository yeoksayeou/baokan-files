　　Wall Street's "Peace Panic"
　　New York Stock Market Continues to Plummet
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: New York dispatch: The New York stock market continued to fall sharply on the 10th. The average price of industrial stocks listed on Wall Street fell by 14.78 points in one day, falling to the lowest point of the year, and becoming the largest drop since the news of U.S. President Eisenhower's heart attack reached Wall Street on September 26, 1955.
    The stock trading on Wall Street was extremely chaotic that day. Stockholders dumped stocks in large quantities, so much so that the stock market indicators could not keep up with the price changes. Amidst the general decline, the stocks of companies manufacturing aircraft, missiles, rocket fuel, and electronic equipment initially fell the most, but then the stock prices of steel, chemical, rubber, and many other sectors related to military production also plummeted. In total, among the 1,238 stocks traded, 979 saw their prices fall.
    Wall Street analysts and Western news agency reporters unanimously believe that the plunge in New York stock market prices is due to the impact of the news that the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States are about to visit each other. They pointed out that Wall Street is generally a bullish market in the summer, but the situation has been the opposite in recent days, with stock prices falling again and again.
    Associated Press reporter Frank Cormier pointed out that many investors on Wall Street are apparently worried that this unprecedented mutual visit between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States "may lead to a reduction in the defense (military) budget."
    Reuters reported that Wall Street believes that "the Cold War may be thawing, which may lead to a reduction or slowdown in U.S. defense (military) efforts." Associated Press reporter Dawson said that this is Wall Street's "peace panic."

### 华尔街的“和平慌”　纽约股票行市继续狂跌

　　华尔街的“和平慌”
　　纽约股票行市继续狂跌
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：纽约股票行市10日继续猛跌，在华尔街挂牌的工业股票平均价格一天之内下跌了十四点七八，即下跌到今年以来的最低点，而成为1955年9月26日美国总统艾森豪威尔患心脏病的消息传到华尔街以来最大的一次下跌。
    华尔街这一天的股票交易极为混乱，股票持有人大量抛出股票，以至股票行市的指示器竟来不及报告价格的变动。在一片跌风当中，下跌得最厉害的最初是制造飞机、导弹、火箭燃料和电子设备等公司的股票，但接着钢铁、化学、橡胶以及其他许多同军事生产有关的部门的股票价格也跟着狂跌。总计在成交的一千二百三十八种股票中，有九百七十九种价格下跌。
    华尔街的分析家和西方通讯社的记者们一致认为，纽约股票市场价格的暴跌是由于苏美两国领导人将要互相访问的消息的影响。他们指出，华尔街在夏季这个时候一般是旺市的，但最近几天情况却相反，股票价格一跌再跌。
    美联社记者弗兰克·科米尔指出，华尔街许多投资人显然担心，苏美两国领导人这次空前的互相访问“可能导致防御（军事）预算的减少”。
    路透社的消息说，华尔街认为，“冷战可能发生解冻，而这就可能导致美国防御（军事）努力的减少或放慢”。美联社记者道逊说，这是华尔街的“和平慌”。
