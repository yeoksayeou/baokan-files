　　World Architecture's Innovation: A Precursor to Industrialized Housing Construction
　　The Soviet Union Rapidly Constructs Buildings Using Three-Dimensional Components
    Xinhua News Agency, August 10th dispatch from TASS, Moscow: A two-story experimental building constructed using three-dimensional components (prefabricated frame blocks produced in factories) has been completed in the Lyublino satellite city on the outskirts of Moscow. The adoption of this advanced method in building construction marks a world first in architectural history.
    This house consists of eight single-room apartments. It takes only twenty minutes to install one apartment on-site. The house is composed of five standard components: rooms, kitchens, stairwells, etc.
    This year, it is planned to install a four-story building in Lyublino using prefabricated complete room units. According to the plan, this building will have one hundred and twenty-eight apartments and will be assembled within one hundred hours.
    Each block is composed of six prefabricated panels, manufactured and assembled as a unit in the factory. At the construction site, they only need to be installed. This will completely industrialize residential construction.
    According to experts' estimates, building houses in large quantities using three-dimensional components can reduce the cost per square meter of living space to 700 rubles, a reduction of at least one-third to one-half. If it takes eight to ten days to build a large block brick house, it will only take one day to build this new type of house; if it takes four to five days to build a large prefabricated panel house, it will only take one day to build this new type of house. The weight per cubic meter of the building is also greatly reduced, which can greatly reduce transportation costs.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 9th dispatch: In a TASS report commemorating this year's Soviet Construction Workers' Day, it was stated that in the past thirty years, Soviet construction workers have built thirty-one thousand large enterprises and many medium and small enterprises for the country. In the last five years alone, 223 million square meters of housing have been built in cities and workers' residential areas, a figure far exceeding the total residential area of Tsarist Russia in 1913.
    In terms of residential construction speed, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States, Britain, and France. For example, in 1957, the Soviet Union averaged 10.6 new housing units per thousand people, the United States averaged 6.7 new housing units per thousand people, France was 6.2 housing units, and Britain was 5.9 housing units.
    During the Seven-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union will establish or renovate 270 large-scale chemical enterprises, bring power plants with a generating capacity of 58 to 60 million kilowatts into operation, and put more than 1,700 light industrial and food industrial enterprises into production. In addition, more than 22 million housing units will be completed, which means that one-third of the country's residents will be able to obtain new housing within seven years.

### 世界建筑史上的创举　住宅建筑工业化的先声　苏联用立体构件快速建楼房

　　世界建筑史上的创举　住宅建筑工业化的先声
　　苏联用立体构件快速建楼房
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：用立体构件建造的两层试验性楼房（装配式框架砌块是在工厂预制的）在莫斯科郊区留布林卫星城落成。在建筑房屋方面采用这种先进方法，在世界建筑史上还是第一次。
    这所房屋由八个单间套房组成。在当地安装一个套房总共只用二十分钟。房屋是由房间、厨房、楼梯间等五个标准构件组成的。
    今年预定在留布林城用预制成套房间的办法安装一幢四层楼的楼房。按照计划，这幢楼房有一百二十八套房间，将在一百个小时内装配好。
    每一套砌块由六块预制板组成，它们在工厂制好并装配成套，在建筑工地上只是安装就行了。这样一来，住宅建筑就会完全工业化了。
    据专家们统计，用立体构件大批建造房屋，可以使每平方米居住面积的造价降低到七百卢布，即起码降低三分之一到二分之一。假如说，建造大型砌块砖房需要八天到十天，那么，建造这种新式房屋只要一天就够了；建造大型预制板房屋需要四、五天，建造这种房屋只要一天就够了。建筑物每立方米的重量也大大减轻，这就可以大大减少运输费。
    据新华社9日讯　塔斯社在一则纪念今年苏联建筑工人节的消息中说，最近三十年来，苏联建筑工人给国家建造了三万一千个大型企业和许多中、小型企业。仅在最近五年内，在城市和工人住宅区内就建造了二亿二千三百万平方米的住宅，这个数字大大超过了1913年沙皇俄国的住宅总面积。
    就住宅建筑速度来说，苏联超过了美国、英国和法国。例如，在1957年，苏联每一千人中平均得到十点六套新住宅，美国每一千人中平均得到六点七套新住宅，法国是六点二套住宅，英国是五点九套住宅。
    在七年计划年代里，苏联将要建立或改建二百七十个大型化学企业，使发电能力为五千八百万到六千万瓩的电站开始发电，使一千七百多个轻工业和食品工业企业投入生产。此外，还要建成二千二百万多套住宅，这意味着全国三分之一的居民在七年内可以得到新住宅。
