Factories and Rural Areas are Full of Subject Matter
Bulgarian Writers Launch "Go Deep Among the Masses" Movement

    This newspaper reports that Bulgarian writers have widely launched a "go deep among the masses" movement. Now, writers spend half a year, a year, or even longer in factories and agricultural production cooperatives. At the same time, Bulgarian writers are also actively participating in social work in order to be closer to the people and delve deeper into life.
    Currently, as the people of Bulgaria are going all out to strive for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, the desire to establish the closest connection with life is inspiring Bulgarian literary workers. This can also be felt in the new direction of writers' creations, such as female writer Gaynovska's new work "Spring Flooding," which is about a new generation of laborers working for the Five-Year Plan. Serganski is writing a novella "Pure Heart," the theme of which is the growth of new people in socialist society. Writers Slavenski, Martinov, and others are writing novels about Bulgaria's new industry. New rural themes and the socialist transformation of the Bulgarian countryside have also inspired many representatives of Bulgarian literature, and peasant life has always been widely reflected in Bulgarian literature. Talented novelists such as Karaslavov, Karaliichev, Daskalov, Grigorov, Volen, and Petrov are all carrying out work with great achievements in this area. Writer Daskalov said after visiting Butan Village in the Oryahovo District: "Every rural village can find subjects for writing novels, novellas, and short stories."

    工厂农村处处有题材
    保作家展开“深入群众”运动
    本报讯　保加利亚作家广泛开展了“深入群众”的运动。现在，作家到工厂和农业生产合作社去的时间是半年、一年或更长的时期。和这同时，保加利亚作家还积极参加社会工作，以求更接近人民，更深入生活。
    目前，在保加利亚全国人民正鼓足干劲争取提前完成五年计划的时候，同生活建立最密切的联系的愿望，激动着保加利亚文学工作者。在作家创作的新方向中，也可以感觉到这一点，例如女作家盖诺夫斯卡的新作
  “春泛”是关于为五年计划工作的新的劳动一代的。赛尔干斯基正在写一本中篇小说“纯洁的心”，主题是社会主义社会中新人的成长。作家斯拉文斯基、马尔丁诺夫等正在写关于保加利亚新工业的小说。新的农村主题、保加利亚农村的社会主义改造也鼓舞了保加利亚文学的许多代表，而农民生活在保加利亚文学中是一向得到广泛反映的。卡拉斯拉沃夫、卡拉里依切夫、达斯卡洛夫、格里戈罗夫、沃连、彼特罗夫等有才华的小说家都在这方面进行着有巨大成就的工作。作家达斯卡洛夫在访问了奥列亚霍沃区布唐村之后说：“每个农村都可以找到写长篇、中篇和短篇小说的题材。”
