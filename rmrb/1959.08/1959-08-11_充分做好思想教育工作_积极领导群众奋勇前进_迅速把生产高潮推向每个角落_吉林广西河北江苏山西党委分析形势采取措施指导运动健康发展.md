This newspaper reports from Changchun on August 10th: The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a decision on August 8th regarding continuing to exert full effort, advance victoriously, and initiate a new upsurge in the production increase and conservation movement.

In the first half of this year, Jilin Province achieved significant results in industrial and agricultural production, transportation, financial and trade work, and other fronts. People's communes have been further consolidated after rectification. From January to July, 56.8% of the annual industrial output value plan was completed, an increase of 44.5% compared to the same period last year. Crude coal production increased by 160%, and timber production increased by 156%. On the agricultural front, local droughts were overcome, wheat harvests were good, and autumn crops are generally growing well, with the expectation of a bumper harvest. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee has decided that it is necessary to utilize the current favorable situation, mobilize all positive factors, overcome difficulties, oppose right-leaning and relaxationist sentiments, and immediately launch a comprehensive and mass-based production increase and conservation movement throughout the province, aiming to complete and exceed the 1959 plan.

The Provincial Party Committee requires that the industrial front in Jilin Province comprehensively complete and exceed the state plan in terms of product quantity, quality, variety, cost, labor productivity, and safety. The slogan on the agricultural front is to strive for an all-around bumper harvest, with both agricultural and sideline occupations flourishing. On the transportation front, a socialist labor competition centered on improving transportation efficiency and quality should be deeply developed. On the financial and trade front, a socialist labor competition centered on increasing production and practicing thrift should continue to be carried out, vigorously supporting production and further improving supply work.

The Provincial Party Committee requires party organizations at all levels in the province to grasp specific organizational work, and requires all departments and units to quickly formulate their own plans and programs, extensively appeal to and mobilize the masses, and establish and improve specialized organizations to promote the movement. Inspection teams, work groups, or staff members should be sent to the grassroots and among the masses to inspect and promote competition and evaluation, promptly identify and solve problems, summarize experiences and lessons, hold on-site meetings, and guide the healthy development of the movement.

This newspaper reports from Nanning on August 10th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a telephone conference of all district party committee secretaries in the autonomous region, requiring party committees at all levels to seize the months of August and September, vigorously carry out production increase and conservation throughout the region, especially further deepening the super-contract production movement in rural areas, and striving for even greater harvests in the intermediate and late rice crops on the basis of the large-scale early rice harvest.

The person in charge of the Autonomous Region Party Committee pointed out at the telephone conference that due to a series of correct policies and measures adopted by the Party in rural work, the masses are in a happy mood and have high enthusiasm for production, which has ensured a large-scale early rice harvest in most areas of the region this year, and the intermediate rice crop also promises a good harvest. At present, a comprehensive production upsurge centered on grain production is gradually taking shape throughout the region, but its development is very uneven. Some areas have carried out the super-contract production movement relatively quickly and well, and cadres have great enthusiasm, while other areas have carried it out relatively slowly and poorly, and some cadres' thinking has not kept up with the development of the situation, and some are hesitant. Therefore, party committees at all levels must earnestly carry out ideological mobilization work among the vast number of cadres and the masses, so that everyone's thinking keeps up with the situation, boosts their morale, and promotes the rapid spread of the production upsurge to every corner of the region. After this telephone conference, party committees at all levels in the districts and counties immediately conveyed and deployed this to the vast number of cadres and the masses.

On August 7th, the Autonomous Region Party Committee also issued a notice to party committees at all levels in the region, urging them to earnestly study and discuss the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Practice Production Increase and Conservation."

This newspaper reports from Tianjin on August 10th: From August 5th to 7th, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of the first secretaries and industrial secretaries of the cities and district party committees, conscientiously analyzed the current favorable situation, and emphasized seizing the great opportunity of August and September to further launch a new upsurge in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

The meeting pointed out that at present, on the basis of the great leap forward last year, the province's industrial and agricultural production is continuing to leap forward, and the overall situation is very good. In the industrial sector, the plan for the first half of the year for major indicators such as steel and coal has greatly increased compared with the same period last year, and the shortage of certain light industrial products has been improved. The management of factories and enterprises has been greatly improved, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers is very high. In the agricultural sector, summer crops have been harvested, and although a few areas have suffered some floods, there is still great hope for an autumn harvest. After the rectification of the communes, the production enthusiasm of the members has been further enhanced, and the super-production competition movement is booming. The production of major non-staple foods such as pigs, vegetables, chickens, and ducks has also increased significantly. However, some cadres have insufficient understanding of this favorable situation, succumb to some temporary difficulties, and thus are hesitant and do not actively lead the masses to forge ahead. This right-leaning sentiment of thinking lagging behind reality and leadership lagging behind the masses is the main obstacle to the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

In order to achieve the leap forward plan for industrial and agricultural production this year, the Provincial Party Committee decided to take several major measures: First, in conjunction with studying the two People's Daily editorials of August 6th and 7th, criticize and correct the right-leaning sentiments among some cadres, thereby boosting morale and striving for the upstream; second, comprehensively solve a series of problems such as coal, transportation, materials, equipment, capital, and labor necessary to complete this year's steel task, and strive to improve the daily steel production level as soon as possible to ensure the completion of the task; third, further carry out mass movements centered on increasing production and practicing thrift on all fronts such as industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation; fourth, emphasize that local first secretaries should comprehensively lead, grasping both agriculture and industry and commerce.

This newspaper reports from Nanjing on August 10th: "Boost morale, fight hard in August and September, and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new achievements in increasing production and practicing thrift." This is the combat call made by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the vast number of cadres and workers on the industrial and transportation front at a telephone conference of responsible comrades of district and municipal party committees held on August 6th.

The meeting first reviewed and inspected the production situation in the first half of the year. In the first half of the year, all departments of the national economy in Jiangsu Province achieved new and greater achievements on the basis of last year's great leap forward, and the industrial output value increased by 71.5% compared with the same period last year. Since the third quarter, the completion of production and construction plans has also been relatively good. The meeting pointed out that in the next five months, the tasks of production and construction remain very heavy, and August and September are important moments to complete the annual production plan. Therefore, in order to comprehensively and overfulfill the annual production and construction plan, first of all, we must seize the time and make every second count to do a good job in production in August and September and ensure the completion of the third-quarter production and construction plan.

The meeting pointed out that local factories and enterprises should immediately organize cadres to study and discuss relevant documents, recognize the situation, criticize the sentiments of fear of difficulties and relaxation that exist among some cadres, and continue to boost revolutionary morale. In order to promote the development of the movement, a comparison and inspection should be organized on various fronts such as industry and transportation. Through comparison and inspection, the key points should be found, measures should be put forward, and a new upsurge in production should be organized. While vigorously engaging in mass movements, we must realistically solve specific problems in production and construction. Leading cadres at all levels must have good discussions with the masses, extensively mobilize the masses, and have the heroic spirit to overcome obstacles and difficulties on the road ahead. The meeting also adopted many measures on how to organize a new upsurge in production and called on all localities to resolutely implement them.

This newspaper reports from Taiyuan on August 10th: Shanxi Province is launching a publicity and education movement to "overcome right-leaning sentiments and vigorously practice production increase and conservation" to boost the current production increase and conservation movement.

The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a notice to the local and municipal party committees, requiring all localities to immediately organize workers to conscientiously study and publicize to the masses the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments and Vigorously Practice Production Increase and Conservation" to lay a good ideological foundation for further developing the production increase and conservation movement. The notice pointed out that when publicizing and organizing workers to study, it is necessary to conscientiously conduct inspections in light of reality and organize several discussions. It is necessary to study the manifestations of right-leaning sentiments, analyze the causes of their emergence, recognize their harm, think of ways to overcome them, and then formulate measures to improve work and immediately put them into action.

At present, this propaganda movement is gradually unfolding throughout the province. Local party committees are widely holding report meetings, telephone conferences, and broadcast rallies to publicize and explain the spirit of the People's Daily editorial to the broad masses of people and mobilize the masses to discuss. On the 7th, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory held a 10,000-person rally to carry out a large-scale propaganda activity. The members of the Datong Municipal Party Committee were also assigned to go to various factories and mines and suburban areas to carry out propaganda activities. The Datong Coal Mine Party Committee organized all party reporters and propagandists to go deep into the grassroots units to carry out propaganda activities, and now 70% of the workers have heard the reports. The party committee secretaries of factories, mines, basic construction, transportation and other units in Changzhi City personally took charge, conveying the spirit of the editorial to the workers and immediately organizing discussions.

The places where the propaganda and education movement has been launched have quickly generated tremendous power. Workers in Yangquan Coal Mine studied and discussed while posting big-character posters to criticize right-leaning relaxationist phenomena and put forward many rationalization proposals for completing the production plan. After the workers of Changzhi Bearing Factory discussed, their production enthusiasm doubled. On August 8th, the factory's production of bearings exceeded about twice the previous daily production level in the past seven months.

    吉林广西河北江苏山西党委分析形势采取措施指导运动健康发展
    本报长春10日电　中共吉林省委于8月8日发出关于继续鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，掀起增产节约运动新高潮的决定。
    今年上半年，吉林省无论在工业、农业生产，交通运输，财贸工作以及其他战线上，都取得了巨大的成绩。人民公社经过整顿，已进一步巩固。1至7月份完成了全年工业总产值计划的56.8％，比去年同期增长了44.5％，原煤产量增长了160％，木材产量增长了156％；农业方面战胜了局部干旱，小麦已经丰收，大秋作物一般生长良好，丰收有望。因此，省委决定，必须利用当前这种有利形势，调动一切积极因素，克服困难，反对右倾松劲情绪，立即在全省范围内，掀起一个全面的、群众性的、以完成和超额完成1959年计划为目标的增产节约运动新高潮。
    省委要求吉林省工业战线在产品数量、质量、品种、成本、劳动生产率及安全等方面，全面完成和超额完成国家计划。在农业战线上的口号，是争取全面大丰收、农业副业双丰收。在交通运输战线上，要深入开展以提高运输效率和运输质量为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛。在财贸工作战线上，要继续开展以增产节约为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛，大力支持生产，进一步改善供应工作。
    省委要求全省各级党组织抓紧具体的组织工作，并要求各部门各单位迅速作出自己的计划和方案，深入地号召和动员群众，并且建立和健全推进运动的专门组织，派出检查团、工作组或工作人员，深入基层和群众中去巡视、检查，推动竞赛、评比，及时发现问题解决问题，总结经验教训，开好现场会议，指导运动健康地发展。
    本报南宁10日电　中共广西僮族自治区委员会在最近召开了全自治区地委书记电话会议，要求各级党委抓紧8、9两个月，在全区厉行增产节约、特别是在农村进一步深入开展超包产运动，在早造大面积丰收的基础上，争取中造晚造更大丰收。
    自治区党委的负责人在电话会议上指出：由于党在农村工作上所采取的一系列的正确的政策和措施，群众心情舒畅，生产热情很高，保证了今年全区绝大部分地区的早造大面积丰收，中造也丰收在望。目前，全区以粮食生产为中心的全面的生产高潮正在逐步形成，但发展很不平衡。有些地区的超包产运动开展得较快较好，干部干劲很大，有的地区就开展得较慢较差，有的干部的思想也跟不上形势的发展，有些束手束脚。因此，各级党委必须认真对广大干部和群众做好思想发动工作，使大家的思想跟上形势，鼓足干劲，推动生产高潮迅速地到达全区的每一个角落。这次电话会议以后，各个地委和县委已立即向广大干部和群众进行传达部署。
    自治区党委在8月7日还向全区各级党委发出了认真学习和讨论人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论的通知。
    本报天津10日电　中共河北省委从8月5日至7日召开了各市、地委第一书记和工业书记会议，认真地分析了目前的有利形势，强调抓紧8、9两个月的大好时机，进一步掀起工农业生产大跃进的新高潮。
    会议指出，目前全省的工农业的生产，在去年大跃进的基础上，正在继续跃进，总的形势是很好的。在工业方面，钢铁煤炭等主要指标上半年的计划完成比去年同期有很大增长，某些轻工业产品供应不足的状况已有改善。厂矿企业管理有了很大改进，广大职工生产热情很高。在农业方面，夏季作物获得了丰收，目前少数地区虽然遭受了一些水灾，但秋季丰收仍有巨大希望。经过整社，社员的生产积极性更加提高了，超产竞赛运动正在蓬勃开展。猪、菜、鸡、鸭等主要副食品的生产也有很大幅度的增长。但是有一部分干部对这种有利形势认识不足，向一些暂时的困难低头，因而束手束脚，不积极领导群众奋勇前进，这种思想落后于实际、领导落后于群众的右倾情绪，是当前工农业生产继续跃进的主要障碍。
    为了实现今年工农业生产的跃进计划，省委决定采取几项主要措施：一是结合学习人民日报8月6日和7日的两篇社论，批判和纠正部分干部中的右倾情绪，从而鼓足干劲，力争上游；二是全面解决对完成今年钢铁任务所必需的煤炭、运输、材料、设备、资金、劳力等一系列的问题，力争尽早地提高钢铁日产水平，保证完成任务；三是在工业、农业、商业、交通运输等各个战线进一步开展以增产节约为中心的群众运动；四是强调各地第一书记全面领导，既抓农业，也抓工、商业。
    本报南京10日电　“鼓足干劲，奋战8、9月，以增产节约的新成就，迎接国庆十周年”，这是中共江苏省委在8月6日召开的地市委负责同志电话会议上，向全省工业交通战线上广大干部和职工提出的战斗号召。
    会议首先回顾和检查了上半年的生产情况。上半年江苏省国民经济各部门在去年大跃进的基础上，又取得了新的更大成就，工业产值比去年同期增加71.5％。第三季度以来，生产建设计划的完成情况也是比较好的。会议指出，在今后五个月中，生产建设任务仍然是十分重大的，而8、9两个月，又是完成全年生产计划的重要时刻。因此，要全面超额完成全年的生产建设计划，首先就要以分秒必争的精神，抓紧搞好8、9两个月的生产，保证完成第三季度生产建设计划。
    会议指出各地厂矿企业要立即组织干部学习和讨论有关文件，认清形势，批判在一部分干部中存在的畏难松劲情绪，继续鼓足革命干劲。为了推进运动的开展，在工业交通运输等各条战线上，都应该组织一次评比检查，通过评比检查，找出关键，提出措施，组织新的生产高潮。在大搞群众运动的同时，必须切切实实解决生产建设中的具体问题。各级领导干部必须很好地和群众商量，深入地发动群众，而且要有过五关、斩六将的英雄气概，克服前进道路上的困难。会议对于如何组织生产新高潮也采取了许多措施，号召各地坚决执行。
    本报太原10日电　山西省展开“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的宣传教育运动，为当前的增产节约运动推波助澜。
    中共山西省委已向各地、市委发出了通知，要各地立即组织职工认真学习和向群众宣传人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，为进一步展开增产节约运动打好思想基础。通知指出，在宣传和组织职工学习的时候，要认真地联系实际进行检查，并组织几次讨论。要研究右倾情绪的表现，分析产生的原因，认识它的危害，想出克服的办法，然后订出改进工作的措施，并立即见诸于行动。
    目前，这个宣传运动正在全省范围内逐步地开展起来，各地党委广泛举行报告会、电话会、广播大会，把人民日报社论的精神向广大群众宣传讲解，发动群众讨论。太原重型机器厂7日举行万人大会，开展大规模的宣传活动。大同市委委员并分工到各厂矿和市郊区去开展宣传活动。大同煤矿党委组织全体党的报告员、宣传员深入基层单位开展宣传活动，现在已有70％的工人听了报告。长治市各厂矿、基本建设、交通运输等单位的党委书记都亲自挂帅，向职工传达了社论的精神，并立即组织了讨论。
    宣传教育运动已经展开的地方，很快就产生了巨大的力量，阳泉煤矿工人边学习讨论，边贴大字报鸣放，批评右倾松劲的现象，并对完成生产计划提出许多合理化建议。长治轴承厂工人讨论后，生产干劲倍增，8月8日，全厂生产轴承即超过了以往七个月日产水平的一倍左右。
