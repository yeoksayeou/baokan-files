　　Night Binds the Azure Dragon
　　Hebei Tianjin　Li Shengyuan
　　Continuous torrential rain poured down, river water surged and roared. The gale fueled the waves, and the flood dragon threatened to swallow villages. Commune members mobilized urgently, but the embankment was steep and the mud slippery, making it difficult to walk. They fell and rose again, the mountain of knives could not stop the heroes. They plugged the leaks and hammered them tight, raised the low spots, and held the collapsed embankment with their chests, linking arms to build a human dam. Fighting through the night until dawn, the heroes bound the azure dragon. The rain stopped, the wind calmed, and the waves subsided. A joyous scene on the river!

　　Opening the Floodgates
　　Jiangsu Xuzhou　Xue Bing
　　Opening the huge floodgates of the reservoir is like a thousand-foot waterfall hanging down. Clear water rolls into the fields. No, this is the commune members spraying fine wine! The fine wine nourishes the land, intoxicating the fields of crops. The corn is like drunken men, and the sorghum blushes with laughter.

　　Pillar Worker
　　Heilongjiang Shuangyashan　Bai Shan
　　Deep down in the mine, the battle to seize coal is underway. Dozens of eyes are watching you, hero who holds up the mountain! The rumble of cannons has just passed, and the smoke is still spreading around. You bravely rushed over, safety lamp flashing in the smoke. Rocks are constantly falling from overhead, the rocks revealing their fangs and claws. You lift up the pillar and support it, the mountain, dare not tremble again! Every step forward that everyone takes towards the coal seam is opened up by you; when comrades rush over to load coal, you are again in the front line protecting them. The combine roars and sings, the coal is merging into a rolling river. Wiping the sweat from your black smiling face, you guard the source of this river. The rocks become tame in front of you, and danger dares not show off to people again. Coming up the well with comrades, pillar worker, the red flag is waving to you!

　　Water and Sweat
    Hunan Chen County  Wang Zhaorong
    For water, we are not afraid to sweat. For water, we will definitely not just talk. The sweat of millions is a living reservoir.

    高潮短曲
　　夜缚苍龙
　　河北天津　李生元连天暴雨倾盆，河水湍流滚滚。狂风给浪助兴，洪蛟要吞乡村。社员紧急出动，陡堤泥滑难行，摔倒爬起再走，刀山难阻英雄。漏洞塞死砸紧，矮处加高尺寸，堤塌挺胸抵住，挽手筑成人堤。黑夜战到天明，英雄缚住苍龙，雨息风停浪静，河上一片欢腾！
　　开闸
　　江苏徐州　雪兵打开水库的巨闸，犹如千尺瀑布垂挂，清澈的水滚进田野，不，这是社员们把美酒喷洒！美酒滋润着大地，灌醉了满田的庄稼，玉米像条条醉汉，高粱涨红着脸笑哈哈。
　　支柱工
　　黑龙江双鸭山　柏山在深深的矿井底下，夺煤的战斗在进行，几十双眼睛看着你呵，托住了大山的英雄！隆隆的炮声刚响过，硝烟还在向四下弥漫，你勇敢地冲了过去，烟雾中安全灯光疾闪。头顶上石块不断落下，岩石露出张牙舞爪的面孔，你搬起来支柱顶上去，大山呀，再不敢颤动！大家向煤层每前进一步，都是你开辟了道路；当同志们冲过去装煤，你又在最前线掩护。康拜因轰隆地歌唱，煤炭汇成了滚动的河流，抹着黝黑的笑脸上的汗粒，你守护在这河流的源头。岩石在你面前变驯服了，危险再不敢向人逞凶。和同志们一起升上井来，支柱工呵，红旗正向你摆动！
　　水和汗
    湖南郴县  王肇荣为了水，我们不怕流汗。为了水，我们决不是空谈。千万人的汗，就是活的蓄水站。
