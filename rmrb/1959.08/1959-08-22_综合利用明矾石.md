    Comprehensive Utilization of Alunite
    Our country is a country with vast alunite mineral resources, not only with large reserves but also with a wide distribution of ore deposits.
    For a long time, our working people have used alunite to produce alum. However, for hundreds of years, alum has been manufactured using water leaching methods. This method cannot make full use of alunite resources.
    Alunite is a comprehensive raw material. By processing alunite with various different methods, we can obtain many things such as ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate, alumina, and sulfuric acid. Because comprehensive processing of alunite can yield several different products, the cost of the products can be reduced. In many cases, producing alumina from alunite costs even less than producing alumina from high-quality bauxite. In the process of our country's socialist construction, the industrial and defense needs for aluminum are increasing day by day. Therefore, under the conditions of sufficient raw material supply and low product costs, it is of great significance to utilize alunite extensively for alumina production. In addition, with the vigorous development of agriculture, the need for fertilizers in agriculture is also becoming increasingly urgent. By treating alunite using comprehensive utilization methods, inexpensive fertilizers can be produced.
    Utilizing alunite to obtain chemical fertilizers and other chemical industrial products is the task of the chemical industry department. Simultaneously obtaining large amounts of aluminum and oxygen during the process, and further processing aluminum and oxygen into metallic aluminum, is the task of the metallurgical department. Therefore, to rationally solve the problem of comprehensive utilization of alunite, all relevant departments must cooperate and work together.
    There are many processing methods for the comprehensive utilization of alunite. Currently, there are two relatively mature methods: one is the ammonia leaching method, and the other is the reduction thermal decomposition method. Both of these methods can be used to obtain products such as potassium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, sulfuric acid, sodium sulfate, alkali, and alumina. Which method is most suitable should be determined based on the needs of the country and the availability of raw materials and equipment. The ammonia leaching method has a longer history of research in China, and much experience has been gained, but this method requires a large amount of synthetic oxygen as raw material; basic construction conditions and raw material sources are limited under the current situation. The reduction thermal decomposition method is superior to the ammonia leaching method in terms of both basic construction conditions and raw material sources. Therefore, under the current circumstances where the country urgently needs aluminum, oxygen, sulfuric acid, and potash fertilizer, the primary task of units researching the comprehensive utilization of alunite is to concentrate their efforts on carrying out experimental research on the reduction thermal decomposition method, quickly overcome technical hurdles, and actively create conditions for building large-scale production plants. At the same time, continue research on the ammonia leaching method, so that large-scale production can be organized when conditions are favorable. Simultaneously, adopting a two-pronged approach and seeking some simple processing methods (indigenous methods or a combination of indigenous and foreign methods) is also an important task for research units at present.

    综合利用明矾石
    我国是一个拥有大量明矾石矿的国家，不仅储藏量大，矿床的分布面积也很广。
    我国劳动人民利用明矾石制造明矾已有悠久的历史。但是，数百年来都是用水浸的方法制造明矾。这种方法不能使明矾石资源得到充分利用。
    明矾石是一种综合原料。用各种不同的方法处理明矾石，可以得到硫酸铵、硫酸钾、氧化铝和硫酸等许多东西。由于综合处理明矾石可以得到几种不同的产品，产品的成本就可以降低。用明矾石生产氧化铝，在许多情况下，比用优质铝土矿生产氧化铝成本还低。在我国社会主义建设过程中，工业上与国防上对铝的需要日益增多。所以，在原料供应充足、产品成本廉价的条件下，大量利用明矾石生产氧化铝是有重要意义的。此外，由于农业的蓬勃发展，农业对肥料的需要也日益迫切。而用综合利用的方法处理明矾石，就可以生产出廉价的肥料。
    利用明矾石取得化学肥料及其他化学工业产品，是化学工业部门的任务。在处理过程中同时取得大量的铝、氧，和把铝、氧进一步加工为金属铝，是冶金部门的任务。因之，要合理地解决明矾石的综合利用问题，必须由各有关部门配合协作，共同努力。
    明矾石综合利用的处理方法很多，目前比较成熟的有两种方法：一是氨浸法，一是还元热解法。利用这两种方法，都可以得到硫酸钾、硫酸铵、硫酸、硫酸钠、碱、氧化铝等产品。究竟用哪种方法最适合，则应该根据国家的需要和原料设备条件来决定。氨浸法在国内的研究历史较长，也取得了许多经验，但是这种方法需要大量的合成氧做原料；基本建设条件和原料来源在目前情况下都受到一定限制。还元热解法无论基本建设条件和原料来源都较氨浸法优越。因此，在目前国家迫切需要铝、氧、硫酸和钾肥的情况下，研究综合利用明矾石的单位，主要任务首先是集中力量进行还元热解法的试验研究工作，很快地过技术关，积极为建设大规模生产厂创造条件。同时继续进行氨浸法的研究，等有条件时好组织大规模的生产。与此同时，采取两条腿走路的方针，寻找一些简易的加工方法（土法的或者是土洋结合的），也是研究单位当前的一个重要课题。
