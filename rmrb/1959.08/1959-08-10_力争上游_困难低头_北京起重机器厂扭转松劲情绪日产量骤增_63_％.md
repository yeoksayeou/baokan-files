Strive Upward, Difficulties Bow Down
Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory Reverses Slack Mood, Daily Output Increases by 63%

(Our newspaper reporter Lei Runming reports) The Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory criticized the slack mood of a few cadres, aroused the revolutionary spirit of all the factory's workers, and comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan and the leap forward plan in July, performing better than the previous two months.

This factory had a significant leap forward in production in the first half of this year, with a total output value increasing by 47.5% compared to the same period last year. However, due to encountering difficulties in the supply of raw materials on the road forward, some cadres developed a slack mood fearing difficulties. Without actively trying to overcome the difficulties, they believed that raw materials were "difficult" to obtain, and production would be difficult to leap forward. This thinking was prominently reflected in the production during the first half of July. When formulating the plan at the beginning of the month, some leaders at the factory and workshop levels lacked confidence in completing a plan that was only 5.77 higher than the actual production level in June and requested to lower this plan. They listed the difficulty of lacking raw materials for the production of four major products such as double-girder bridge cranes and belt conveyors as the basis for their lack of confidence in completing the plan. They said, "Without materials, what's the point of making a plan? It's just a waste of time!" Due to this kind of thinking, production was not tightly controlled, and production scheduling meetings were not held on time. As a result, by July 20th, only 56.3% of the monthly leap forward plan had been completed.

How to quickly reverse this slack mood of fearing difficulties became an important problem that urgently needed to be solved in order for the factory to complete its monthly plan. At this time, according to the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the factory party committee quickly convened a conference of all party member cadres and a conference of employee representatives to conduct in-depth "theoretical discussion" based on the spirit of the party's general line for socialist construction, combined with a summary of the work in the first half of the year. Everyone focused on discussing the following issues: 1. Is there any slackening? 2. How big is the difficulty of raw materials? Is there no way to solve it at all? 3. How should we deal with difficulties?

The discussion was both theoretical and practical, and very enthusiastic. Some people reviewed and said that seeing that the materials could not be delivered, they were somewhat slack and did not actively think of ways to overcome it. Everyone agreed that this kind of thinking was contrary to the spirit of the general line and was a thought of insufficient enthusiasm and willingness to settle for mediocrity. The most heated discussion was on the issue of raw material difficulties. At the beginning of the month, some people believed that according to the components processed from existing materials, only ten single-girder bridge cranes, one double-girder bridge crane, and fifty belt conveyors could be assembled for the whole month. With the gradual improvement of ideological understanding, many people no longer looked at the problem this way. Some said, if we only do things according to the existing materials and don't think of any ways, what do we need these people for? After everyone's analysis, it turned out that it was not a dead end. Four methods were devised during the discussion: 1. Utilize waste materials; 2. Carry out technical innovations for substitutions; 3. Adjust and exchange with fraternal factories; 4. Improve product design and blanking methods to save raw materials. For example, the leading cadres and workers of the structure workshop said that the walkway of the double-girder bridge crane could be completely paved with waste materials, and the missing I-beams, carbon steel, channel steel, etc., could be adjusted with one's own materials and fraternal factories. If the reducer gears were missing cast steel parts, forgings could be used instead. After discussion, most of the originally missing raw materials were figured out. In this way, everyone not only did not ask to lower the original planned targets, but also was full of confidence in overfulfilling the plan. Some people said that they were frightened by the difficulties before, but now it seems that there is nothing great about it. Some said that the more you fear difficulty, the more powerful it becomes, and sometimes it will overwhelm you. If you are not afraid of it and think of ways to overcome it, it will become smaller or even disappear.

The general line illuminated everyone's thinking. After inspection and discussion, the cadres and workers of the entire factory felt suddenly enlightened and renewed their enthusiasm. From leaders to workers immediately took action to find ways to solve the raw material difficulties. Engineering and technical personnel braved the rain to go to the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute to find professors to study the problem of using 7mm steel plates to replace 6mm steel plates; personnel from the supply and marketing department, through certain procedures, transferred 69 tons of needed materials from fraternal factories. Workers in the structure workshop used their spare time to pick up waste materials, collecting a total of 50 tons and utilizing 20 tons.

Under the circumstances that the raw material supply did not change at all, the production situation was completely different due to the improvement of workers' awareness and the boosting of enthusiasm. Twenty more single-girder bridge cranes were assembled than originally planned, two more double-girder bridge cranes were assembled, and thirty-two more belt conveyors were assembled. The product quality was also very good. In addition, the workers in the structure workshop also used waste materials to pave the walkways of 30 double-girder bridge cranes, making them finished products. In this way, production in the last ten days of July rose rapidly, with an average daily production level increasing by 63% compared to the middle ten days. The entire factory not only did not lower the original plan, but also overfulfilled the state plan and the leap forward plan.

The fact that the plan was overfulfilled in July gave the cadres and workers of this factory a profound education. Li Baoshu, a member of the factory's party committee and the director in charge of production, said, "It seems that enthusiasm must be boosted at all times, and we must strive upward at all times. I really didn't expect that as soon as the thinking changed, production would immediately go up so much! The party's general line for building socialism is a powerful weapon to guide us to always forge ahead!"

    力争上游　困难低头
    北京起重机器厂扭转松劲情绪日产量骤增63％
    本报讯　记者雷润明报道：北京起重机器厂批判了少数干部的松劲情绪，鼓起了全厂职工的革命干劲，7月份全面超额完成了国家计划和跃进计划，比前两个月生产情况都好。
    这个工厂今年上半年生产有很大跃进，总产值较去年同期增长47.5％。但是由于在前进的道路上碰到了原材料供应不足的困难，部分干部就产生了畏惧困难的松劲情绪。还没有积极设法去克服困难，他们就认为原材料“困难”，生产难以跃进。这种思想突出地表现在7月上半月的生产中。月初制订计划时，厂级和车间的一部分领导干部对仅仅高于6月份实际生产水平五点七七的计划就没有信心完成，要求把这个计划降低。他们列举生产双梁桥式起重机、皮带运输机等四种主要产品缺少原材料的困难，作为没有信心完成计划的根据。他们说：“没材料，计划订了，还不是白订！”由于有这种思想，对生产就抓得不紧了，生产调度会议也不按时开了。就这样，到7月20日只完成全月跃进计划56.3％。
    如何迅速扭转这种畏惧困难的松劲情绪，成了这个厂完成全月计划急待解决的重要问题。在这个时候，工厂党委根据中共北京市委的指示，迅速分别召开了全厂党员干部大会和职工代表大会，根据党的社会主义建设总路线的精神，结合总结上半年工作进行了深入的
  “务虚”。大家着重讨论了以下几个问题：一、松劲没有？二、原材料的困难有多大？是不是一点办法也没有？三、应该如何对待困难？
    讨论中既务虚，也务实，非常热烈。有些人检查说，看到材料来不了，劲是有些松了，也不积极想办法克服了。大家一致认为：这种思想是和总路线的精神相违背的，是干劲不足、甘居中游的思想。讨论最热烈的是原材料困难问题。月初时有些人认为，按现有材料所加工成的部件来计算，单梁桥式起重机全月只能装成十台，双梁桥式起重机装成一台，皮带运输机装成五十台。由于思想认识逐步提高，很多人不这样看问题了。有的说，只按现有材料办事，一点办法不想，还要我们这些人干什么？经过大家分析，原来并非山穷水尽，无路可走，讨论中想出了四条办法：一、利用废料；二、技术革新搞代用；三、和兄弟工厂调剂互换；四、改进产品设计和下料方法，节约原材料。如结构车间的领导干部和工人说，双梁桥式起重机的走台，可以完全用废料来铺，所缺的工字钢、炭结钢、槽钢等，可用自己的材料和兄弟工厂调剂，减速机的齿轮没有铸钢件，可用锻件代替。经过讨论，原来缺的原材料大部分都想出了办法。这样，大家不但不要求降低原来的计划指标，而且对超额完成计划充满了信心。有的人说，以前是被困难吓住了，现在看来，也没有什么了不起。有的说，困难这个东西，你越怕它它越厉害，有时就压得你喘不过气来，你不怕他，想办法去克服它，它就变小了，甚至变得没有了。
    总路线照亮了大家的思想，经过检查和讨论，全厂干部和工人心里豁然开朗，重新鼓起干劲。从领导到工人立即行动起来，千方百计解决原材料困难。工程技术人员冒雨到北京钢铁学院找教授研究用七米厘钢板代替六米厘钢板的问题；供销科的人员通过一定手续，向兄弟工厂调剂到需用的材料六十九吨。结构车间的工人利用业余时间拣废料，共拣了五十吨，利用了二十吨。
    在原材料供应没有任何变化的情况下，由于职工的认识提高了，干劲鼓起来了，生产情况也就完全不同。单梁桥式起重机较原计划多装了二十台，双梁桥式起重机多装了两台，皮带运输机多装了三十二台，产品质量也很好。除此之外，结构车间的工人还用废料将三十台双梁桥式起重机的走台铺了起来，使它成为成品。这样，7月下旬的生产就飞速上升，平均日产水平比中旬提高了63％。全厂不但没有降低原来的计划，还超额完成了国家计划和跃进计划。
    7月份超额完成计划的事实，使这个工厂的干部和工人受到了一次深刻的教育。这个工厂的党委委员主管生产的厂长李宝树说：“看来，干劲必须时时鼓足，必须时时力争上游，真没想到思想一转变，生产就马上上去那么多！党的建设社会主义的总路线是指导我们永远奋勇向前的有力武器！”
