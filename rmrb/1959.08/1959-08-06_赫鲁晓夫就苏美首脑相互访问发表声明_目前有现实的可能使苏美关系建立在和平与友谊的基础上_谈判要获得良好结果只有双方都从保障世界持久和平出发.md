Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th (TASS): Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev held a press conference today attended by Soviet and foreign journalists. At the conference, he issued a statement regarding his upcoming visit to the United States and U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union.

The press conference was held in the Sverdlov Hall of the Kremlin.

Khrushchev stated at the beginning of the press conference that he would be visiting the United States around mid-September, and the U.S. President would visit the Soviet Union later in the fall of this year.

Khrushchev emphasized that there is now a realistic possibility of building Soviet-U.S. relations on a foundation of peace and friendship. He said that there are no territorial disputes or irreconcilable contradictions between our two countries, and there are no problems that would hinder the establishment of trust and mutual understanding.

Khrushchev pointed out, therefore, that we hope that the mutual visits between the U.S. President and myself will bring benefits. We, on our part, will make every effort to ensure that the talks and discussions to be held between us will help to establish better mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States, and will help the cause of peace.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is willing to do everything possible to establish relations between the Soviet Union and the United States on a solid foundation of peace and friendly cooperation. He went on to say that if Soviet-U.S. relations brighten up, then this will inevitably affect the improvement of relations with other countries, and will help to dispel the clouds over other regions of the world.

Khrushchev said, of course, we not only want to be friends with the United States, but also want to be friends with America's friends. At the same time, we hope that the United States will establish good relations not only with us, but also with our friends.

Khrushchev emphasized that if good friendly relations are established between the Soviet Union and the United States, and if Soviet-U.S. cooperation can be arranged in the cause of safeguarding peace, then world peace will be more consolidated and lasting.

Khrushchev said that we advocate that heads of government or heads of state, those who enjoy high prestige and power, should meet more often and exchange views. However, such negotiations will only produce good results if the main starting point of each party in the negotiations is to strive to ensure the lasting peace desired by the people of all countries.

Khrushchev emphasized that his talks with British Prime Minister Macmillan during his visit to the Soviet Union in February of this year undoubtedly played a major role in improving Soviet-British relations. Khrushchev said that we have every reason to say that our talks with Mr. Macmillan were beneficial and fruitful.

Subsequently, Khrushchev answered questions raised by reporters.

    赫鲁晓夫就苏美首脑相互访问发表声明
    目前有现实的可能使苏美关系建立在和平与友谊的基础上
    谈判要获得良好结果只有双方都从保障世界持久和平出发
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天举行了有苏联和外国记者参加的记者招待会。他在会上就他将访问美国和美国总统艾森豪威尔将访问苏联的问题发表了声明。
    记者招待会是在克里姆林宫斯维德洛夫大厅举行的。
    赫鲁晓夫在记者招待会开始时说，他大约将于9月中旬到美国去，而美国总统则在迟一些时候，在今年秋季访问苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，目前具有现实的可能使苏美关系建立在和平与友谊的基础上。他说，在我们两国之间没有什么领土纠纷和不可解决的矛盾，不存在会妨碍建立信任和彼此谅解的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，因此，我们希望，美国总统和我的相互访问将会带来益处。我们这方面将尽一切努力，使我们双方之间将要举行的会谈和讨论有助于建立苏联和美国之间的更好的相互谅解，有助于和平事业。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联愿意尽一切可能使苏联和美国之间的关系建立在和平和友好合作的牢固基础上。他接着说，如果苏美关系明亮起来，那么，这必然也会影响到同其他国家关系的改善，有助于驱散世界其他地区上空的乌云。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当然，我们不光是想同美国友好，而且也想同美国的朋友友好。同时，我们希望，美国不仅同我们、而且也同我们的朋友建立良好的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，如果苏联和美国之间将建立起良好的友谊关系，如果能够在保障和平的事业中安排好苏美合作，那么，世界和平将更加巩固和持久。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们主张政府首脑或国家元首，那些享有高度威信和权力的人士更经常地举行会见，交换意见。但是，这种谈判只有在这种情况下才会产生良好的结果，即谈判的每一方的主要出发点是，力求保障世界各国人民所渴望的持久和平。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，他同英国首相麦克米伦在今年2月访问苏联时所举行的会谈，在改善苏联和英国的关系方面无疑地起了重大的作用。赫鲁晓夫说，我们有充分的根据说，我们同麦克米伦先生的会谈是有益的和有成果的。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫回答了记者们提出的问题。
