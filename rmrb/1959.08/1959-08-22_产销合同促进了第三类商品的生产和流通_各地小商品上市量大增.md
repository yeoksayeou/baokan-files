Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 21st. Commercial departments in various regions are implementing production-sales contracts at all levels. After the first national exchange conference for third category commodities, they universally convened material exchange meetings at each level, actively arranged production, and did everything possible to promote the fulfillment of contracts.

According to preliminary inspections by commercial departments in various regions, as of the end of July, the total value of small local and special products, daily-use miscellaneous goods, and other small commodities provided by various regions according to contracts reached more than 480 million yuan, equivalent to 47.25% of the total purchase and sale amount of contracts and agreements signed at the exchange conference. In Shanghai alone, the total value of third category commodities transferred out in the second quarter reached more than 170 million yuan, exceeding the original contract total value by 30%. The volume of third category commodities on the market has increased significantly. For example, in Liangping County, Sichuan Province, the volume of third category commodities on the market in the first half of the year increased by half compared with the same period last year, and the purchase volume of wild plants and small local products increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year. Some small commodities that were once in short supply in some cities, such as bamboo chopsticks, spoons, brushes, etc., can now meet consumer needs. The supply of industrial raw materials among the third category commodities has also increased. For example, Guangzhou's paper industry received 300,000 tons of citronella grass residue from Hainan Island, which is enough for the production of yellow board paper in the second half of the year.

In recent months, commercial departments in various regions have actively started with organizing production, so that contracts are implemented at the grassroots production units such as factories and people's communes. The technical cooperation agreements signed at the first national exchange conference for third category commodities are also being gradually realized. For example, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces are exchanging technology for raising wax insects and hanging wax according to the agreement, which has brought new development to the white wax production in both provinces.

    产销合同促进了第三类商品的生产和流通
    各地小商品上市量大增
    据新华社天津21日电　各地商业部门层层落实产销合同，在全国第一次第三类商品交流大会以后，普遍地逐级召开物资交流会，积极安排生产，千方百计地促进合同的实现。
    据各地商业部门最近初步检查，截至7月底止，各地按合同提供的小土特产品、日用杂品等小商品的总值达四亿八千多万元，相当于交流会上所订合同、协议的购销总额的47.25％。上海一地，第二季度调出的第三类商品总值达一亿七千多万元，超过原订合同总值30％。市场上第三类商品的上市量显著增加。如四川省梁平县上半年上市的第三类商品比去年同期增加一半，其中野生植物和小土产品的收购量比去年同期增加两倍多。有些城市一度供应不足的若干小商品，如竹筷、匙勺、刷子等，现在都已能满足消费需要。第三类商品中提供的工业原料也增加了。如广州造纸工业得到了海南岛供应的三十万吨香茅草渣，足够下半年生产黄板纸用。
    这几个月来，各地商业部门积极从组织生产入手，使合同落实到工厂和人民公社等基层生产单位。在全国第一次第三类商品交流会上签订的技术协作协议也在陆续实现。如四川、云南两省按照协议互相交流养蜡虫和挂蜡的技术，使两省的白蜡生产都有了新的发展。
