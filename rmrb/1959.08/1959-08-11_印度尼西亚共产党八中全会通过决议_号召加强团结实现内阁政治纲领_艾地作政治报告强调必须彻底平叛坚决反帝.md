Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 8th. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) concluded on the 7th after two days of meetings. The meeting adopted a resolution approving the political report entitled "Restoring the 1945 Constitution for Reform in Politics and Life," which was delivered at the meeting by PKI General Secretary D.N. Aidit on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. The meeting also approved materials to be submitted by the Central Committee to the Sixth National Congress of the PKI, scheduled for late August. These materials will be included in the summary report to be delivered by General Secretary Aidit to the Congress.

The meeting decided to send representatives to deliver the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the PKI to President Sukarno and First Minister Djuanda.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 9th. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party announced on the 7th that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the PKI had passed a resolution regarding the report entitled "Restoring the 1945 Constitution for Reform in Politics and Life," which was delivered by PKI General Secretary D.N. Aidit on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.

The resolution expressed agreement with all the arguments in the report. The resolution stated that the plenary session agreed with the conclusion made in the report: the party's advocacy of restoring the 1945 Constitution by presidential decree is the correct political line. The plenary session agreed with the party's political line and attitude towards the current cabinet.

The resolution stated that the plenary session agreed with the point that the participation of many military personnel in the cabinet has caused some doubts and questions among the people; the plenary session believes that those military personnel who have joined the cabinet must put the interests of the people above their personal interests and guarantee political freedom in order to prove their sincerity.

The resolution stated that the plenary session emphasized that every progressive person has the responsibility to make constant efforts to change the balance of power and to convince everyone that only a coalition cabinet can guarantee more solid national unity, arouse the great enthusiasm of the people, and provide hope for solving all urgent problems.

The resolution stated that the report reminded the government that the current government can only hope to realize its program if the ministers steadfastly face and rely on the people and respect the people's basic and democratic rights, and only by removing all anti-people elements, anti-democratic elements, bureaucrats, and corrupt elements from the central and local civil and military institutions. Doing so is correct.

The resolution agreed with the analysis of the international situation in the report. The resolution stated that the plenary session agreed with the view that the imperialist world, which pursues aggression and cold war policies, is increasingly disintegrating, while the socialist camp, which pursues democratic and peaceful policies, is increasingly consolidated and united.

The resolution called on the Indonesian government and people to pay attention to the warning raised in the report: Japanese militarism is being revived. The resolution called on the Indonesian government and people to be vigilant and oppose this practice of Japanese militarism, which is dangerous to Indonesia's independence and security.

The resolution called on the Indonesian people to pay attention to the aggressive activities of the United States in Asia. The resolution pointed out that the anti-colonial movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is expanding.

Regarding the West Irian issue, the resolution expressed agreement with public opinion's criticism of the policy of not submitting this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.

The resolution called on all party members and democrats to further strengthen unity and increase vigilance to realize the cabinet's political program, further consolidate the international united front for defending peace and opposing colonialism, and strive to establish a coalition cabinet in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 9th. D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered a political report entitled "Restoring the 1945 Constitution for Reform in Politics and Life" at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on the 6th.

Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party's attitude towards the Sukarno-Djuanda cabinet is basically the same as its previous attitude towards the Djuanda cabinet. When the Sukarno-Djuanda cabinet does not hinder the development of the independence movement and the democratic movement, the Indonesian Communist Party will unreservedly support its progressive policies, criticize its hesitant policies to make them progressive policies, and oppose those ministers who would implement policies that would be detrimental to the people. Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party fully agrees with the current cabinet's political program and is willing to help realize these programs.

Aidit said that the new cabinet formed after the restoration of the 1945 Constitution was established in a situation where the decree prohibiting political activities had not been lifted and the people had no opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings. This situation is the first weakness in realizing the restoration of the 1945 Constitution.

Aidit pointed out that the differences between the current cabinet and the past cabinets are:
	(1) The current cabinet is led by Sukarno, the main leader of revolutionary nationalists;
	(2) Cabinet ministers are only assistants to the President, and the President can dismiss them at any time if necessary;
	(3) The cabinet's political program is concise and includes the most urgent interests of the people;
	(4) Many military personnel have joined the current cabinet.

Aidit pointed out that the first three points are the positive factors of the current cabinet, and the last point can be a positive or negative factor, depending on the actions of those military personnel holding ministerial positions.

Aidit believes that military personnel should only handle matters of national defense and public security, and those military personnel working in enterprises and non-military departments should renounce their military status and become civilians.

Aidit also believes that only by relying on the people can the Sukarno-Djuanda cabinet realize its political program and policies. Aidit expressed the hope that anti-people and anti-democratic elements, bureaucrats, and corrupt officials will be purged from the government and military departments.

When talking about how to realize the cabinet's three-point political program, Aidit believes that in order to realize the first point of the program (to make the people well-fed and well-clothed in the shortest possible time), the production of rice and textiles should be increased. When talking about the second point of the program (guaranteeing the security of the people and the country), Aidit said that more people should be mobilized to participate in the struggle to defend national security and completely eliminate the rampant rebel groups and the "Islamic Army" under the leadership of the government army. "Peace negotiations" or reconciliation with the rebels must be avoided. Aidit said that the policy on restoring public security must be consistent with the government's promise to hold general elections next September.

Regarding the third point of the program (continuing the struggle against imperialism politically and economically), Aidit pointed out that continuing to oppose imperialism economically means maximizing the profits of the Dutch enterprises taken over and nationalized for the Indonesian state and people. It also means quickly taking over the Dutch capital of Batavia Oil Company, and continuing to weaken other foreign imperialist enterprises by increasing taxes and reducing preferences, and quickly abolishing the foreign investment law.

Aidit said that continuing to oppose imperialism politically means taking more resolute and bolder actions to oppose the subversive activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, first of all the subversive activities of the United States, the subversive activities of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, the subversive activities of the Netherlands, and other imperialists.

Aidit pointed out that the recovery of West Irian is still Indonesia's national demand. He believes that the West Irian issue should be brought to the United Nations at present.

When talking about the attitude towards the current cabinet, Aidit said, "We will continue to strive to achieve a cooperative cabinet including members of the Indonesian Communist Party. Because at present, no other cabinet is better than a cooperative cabinet." This cooperative cabinet can be realized by removing ministers in the current cabinet who have made mistakes in their line or by reorganizing the entire cabinet.

Aidit said that after the restoration of the 1945 Constitution, obstacles to the organization of a cooperative cabinet arose. He also said that those who support the establishment of a national cabinet, that is, a cooperative cabinet, include: the working people, left-wing nationalists, and progressive leaders of the religious community, while those who oppose it are right-wing nationalists, reactionary elements of the religious community, especially die-hard elements and imperialists.

Aidit pointed out that the composition of the Provisional Supreme Advisory Council and the National Planning Council is close to the spirit of cooperation advocated by Sukarno's concept. This shows that President Sukarno is sincere in realizing his concept. This is entirely in line with the thoughts and feelings of the people, who believe that representatives of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party should not be allowed to participate in the Supreme Advisory Council. Aidit also said that efforts should be made to establish a People's Consultative Assembly that can protect the 1945 Constitution. Efforts should also be made to establish a national front that can reflect cooperation between various political groups and professional groups, including military and civilians.

Aidit believes that the current situation in Indonesia is that the forces of the die-hards have been greatly weakened, the progressive forces are getting stronger and stronger, and the intermediate forces have basically not changed.

Aidit said, "Our current task is to unite with the Sukarno-Djuanda cabinet in order to realize the cabinet's three-point political program, thoroughly defeat the counter-revolutionary rebel groups and the 'Islamic Army,' and further isolate the die-hards. The Indonesian Communist Party must unite with all democratic patriotic parties, groups, and individuals to resolutely safeguard the people's basic human rights and democratic rights."

Aidit concluded by saying, "Only by realizing the above tasks can the restoration of the 1945 Constitution mean reform in politics and in the people's lives. Only by carrying out these reforms can the people continue to support the restoration of the 1945 Constitution."

When talking about the international situation, Aidit said that the current international situation shows that the strength of the international united front, with the socialist camp as its basic force, is expanding and growing stronger, while the strength of the imperialist camp is increasingly disintegrating.

Aidit pointed out that the strength of the socialist camp and the anti-colonial forces has grown tremendously, and the forces of peace are strong enough to prevent world war.

Aidit said that the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower are good omens for world peace and international security. He pointed out that holding summit meetings is the aspiration of the people of the world.

Aidit condemned US imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for constantly using the puppets of South Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos to create tense situations, and condemned the SEATO warships and planes for carrying out provocations in Indonesian territorial waters. Aidit said that the United States recently plotted a conspiracy in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a military base for its attack on neighboring socialist countries and for exerting pressure on Cambodia. Aidit expressed that the Indonesian people fully support the proposal to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos in order to strictly supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

In the final part of his report, Aidit said that in the current international situation, the task of the Indonesian Communist Party is to continue to unite all patriotic forces in order to promote the government to earnestly and resolutely implement an active and independent foreign policy, defend peace, and oppose colonialism.

Aidit concluded by saying that the domestic and international situation makes us increasingly firm in our conviction that the whole world, including Indonesia, is always turning in a much better direction that brings hope to the people of the whole world. Aidit also said that the party will surely complete its historical tasks, whether domestic or international. The party should more decisively guide its actions with Marxism-Leninism, continuously strengthen the party's ties with the masses, continuously improve revolutionary vigilance and strengthen national unity, and not miss opportunities to develop good and progressive things.

　　印度尼西亚共产党八中全会通过决议
　　号召加强团结实现内阁政治纲领
　　艾地作政治报告强调必须彻底平叛坚决反帝
    新华社雅加达8日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议在举行了两天会议之后于7日闭幕。会议通过了关于批准题为“恢复1945年宪法是为了在政治方面和生活方面进行改革”的政治报告的决议，这个报告是由印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地代表党中央委员会政治局在会议上发表的。会议还批准了将由中央委员会向订于8月下旬举行的印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会提出的材料，这些材料将包括在总书记艾地向代表大会发表的总结报告中。
    会议决定派遣代表，把印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议的决议递交给苏加诺总统和第一部长朱安达。
    据新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处在7日宣布，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议通过了关于印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地代表中央委员会政治局所作的题为“恢复1945年宪法是为了在政治方面和生活方面进行改革”的报告的决议。
    决议表示同意报告中的一切论点。决议说，全会同意报告中所作出的结论：党主张由总统命令恢复1945年宪法的政治路线是正确的。全会同意党对现内阁所采取的政治路线和态度。
    决议说，全会同意这个论点：许多军人的参加内阁在人民中间引起了某些怀疑和疑问；全会认为，那些加入内阁的军人必须把人民的利益放在个人利益之上和保证政治自由，这样来证明他们是真诚的。
    决议说，全会强调指出，每个进步人士都有责任作出不断的努力，来改变力量对比和使每个人相信，只有合作内阁才能够保证更巩固的民族团结，激起人民的巨大热情和为解决一切迫切的问题提供希望。
    决议说，报告提醒政府注意，只有部长们坚持不渝地面对人民和依靠人民并尊重人民的基本权利和民主权利，只有把一切反人民分子、反民主分子、官僚主义者和贪污分子从中央和地方的民政机构和军事机构中清除出去，现政府才能有希望实现它的纲领。这样做是正确的。
    决议同意报告中对国际形势的分析。决议说，全会同意这样的看法：奉行侵略和冷战政策的帝国主义世界日益分崩离析，而奉行民主与和平政策的社会主义阵营日益巩固和团结。
    决议号召印度尼西亚政府和人民注意这个报告中提出的警告：日本军国主义正在复活。决议呼吁印度尼西亚政府和人民提高警惕和反对日本军国主义的这种作法，这种作法对印度尼西亚的独立和安全是危险的。
    决议号召印度尼西亚人民注意美国在亚洲的侵略活动，决议指出，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的反殖民主义运动正在日益扩大。
    至于西伊里安问题，决议表示同意公众舆论对不把这个问题提交联合国大会这种政策的责备。
    决议号召全体党员和民主人士进一步加强团结和提高警惕，来实现内阁的政治纲领，进一步巩固保卫和平和反对殖民主义的国际统一战线以及争取在将来建立合作内阁。
    据新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地6日在印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议上作了政治报告，报告的题目是：“恢复1945年宪法是为了在政治方面和生活方面进行改革”。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党对待苏加诺—朱安达内阁的态度同它以前对待朱安达内阁的态度基本上是一样的。当苏加诺—朱安达内阁并不阻挠独立运动和民主运动的发展的时候，印度尼西亚共产党将毫无保留地支持它的进步政策，批评它的裹足不前的政策而使之成为进步的政策，并且反对那些让他们执行政策将对人民不利的部长们。艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党完全同意目前内阁的政治纲领，并且愿意帮助实现这些纲领。
    艾地说，在恢复1945年宪法以后所组成的新内阁，是在禁止政治活动的法令尚未取消而人民没有机会表达他们的思想和感情的情况下建立的。这种情况是实现恢复1945年宪法的第一个弱点。
    艾地指出，目前的内阁同过去的内阁的不同之点有：
      （一）目前的内阁是由革命的民族主义者的主要领袖苏加诺领导的；
      （二）内阁部长只是总统的助手，如果有必要，总统可以随时解除他们的职务；
      （三）内阁的政治纲领是简明的，包括了人民大众最迫切的利益；
    （四）有很多军人参加了目前的内阁。
    艾地指出，头三点是目前内阁的积极因素，最后一点可以是积极的也可以是消极的因素，这取决于担任部长职位的那些军人的行动。
    艾地认为，军人只应该处理国防和公共安全方面的事务，在企业和非军事部门工作的那些军人应该放弃他们的军籍而成为文官。
    艾地还认为，只有依靠人民，苏加诺—朱安达内阁才能实现它的政治纲领和政策。艾地表示希望，反人民和反民主的分子，官僚主义者和腐化分子将被从政府和军事部门清除出去。
    在谈到如何实现内阁的三点政治纲领时，艾地认为，为了实现第一点纲领（在尽可能短的时间内使人民丰衣足食），应该增加大米和纺织品的生产。艾地在谈到第二点纲领（保障人民和国家的安全）时说，应该动员更多的人民在政府军的领导下参加保卫国家安全和彻底消灭猖獗的叛乱集团和“伊斯兰教军”的斗争，必须避免同叛乱分子进行“和平谈判”或达成和解。艾地说，关于恢复公共安全的政策必须和政府的诺言一致，那就是在明年9月举行普选。
    关于纲领的第三点（在政治上和经济上继续进行反对帝国主义的斗争），艾地指出，在经济方面继续反对帝国主义意味着使接收过来和收归国有的荷兰企业给印度尼西亚国家和人民产生最大限度的利润，这也意味着迅速接收巴达维亚石油公司的荷兰资金，并且用增加赋税和减少优惠的办法继续削弱其他外国帝国主义企业和很快地废除外国投资法。
    艾地说，在政治上继续反对帝国主义意味着采取更加坚决和更加果敢的行动来反对东南亚条约组织的颠复活动，首先是反对美国的颠复活动、蒋介石国民党的颠复活动、荷兰和其他帝国主义的颠复活动。
    艾地指出，收复西伊里安仍旧是印度尼西亚的民族要求。他认为，目前西伊里安问题应当提到联合国去。
    艾地在谈到对目前内阁采取的态度时说，“我们将继续努力争取实现包括印度尼西亚共产党人在内的合作内阁。因为在目前没有别的内阁比合作内阁更好。”这种合作内阁可以通过解除现内阁中犯了路线错误的部长或改组整个内阁来实现。
    艾地说，在恢复1945年宪法以后，组织合作内阁的障碍产生了。他又说，赞成建立民族内阁即合作内阁的人有：劳动人民、左翼国民党人和宗教界进步领袖，反对的是右翼国民党人、宗教界反动分子，首先是死硬顽固分子和帝国主义分子。
  艾地指出，临时最高咨询委员会和国家计划委员会的成分是接近苏加诺方案所主张的合作精神的。这说明，苏加诺总统是真诚地要实现他的方案的。这完全符合人民的思想和感情，人民认为不应当容许马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的代表参加最高咨询委员会。艾地还说，应当努力争取建立一个能保护1945年宪法的人民协商会议。还应当努力争取建立能反映各政治团体和包括军民的专业团体之间的合作的全国阵线。
    艾地认为，目前印度尼西亚国内形势是，死硬派的力量大大地削弱了，进步力量愈来愈强，中间力量基本上没有改变。
    艾地说，“我们目前的任务是和苏加诺—朱安达内阁团结一致，以便实现内阁的三点政治纲领，彻底挫败反革命叛乱集团和‘伊斯兰教军’，进一步孤立死硬派。印度尼西亚共产党必须和一切民主爱国政党、集团和个人团结起来，坚决地维护人民的基本人权和民主权利。”
    艾地最后说，“只有实现上述任务，恢复1945年宪法才能意味着在政治方面和人民生活方面进行改革。只有进行这些改革，人民才能继续支持恢复1945年宪法。”
    艾地在谈到国际局势时说，目前的国际局势说明，以社会主义阵营为基本力量的国际统一阵线的力量正在日益扩大和壮大，而帝国主义阵营的力量却在日益分崩离析。
    艾地指出，社会主义阵营的力量和反殖民主义的力量已经有了巨大的发展，和平力量已强大得足以防止世界战争。
    艾地说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将进行的相互访问，是世界和平和国际安全的良好征兆。他指出，举行最高级会议是世界人民的热望。
    艾地谴责美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织经常利用南越、泰国和老挝的傀儡制造张紧局势，并且谴责东南亚条约组织的军舰和飞机在印度尼西亚领海进行挑衅。艾地说，美国最近在老挝策划阴谋，企图将老挝变为它进攻邻近的社会主义国家和对柬埔寨施加压力的军事基地。艾地表示，印度尼西亚人民充分支持恢复老挝国际委员会活动以便在老挝严格监督日内瓦协议的执行的建议。
    艾地在他的报告的最后部分说，在目前的国际形势下，印度尼西亚共产党的任务是继续团结一切爱国力量以便推动政府认真和坚决地执行积极和独立的外交政策，保卫和平和反对殖民主义。
    艾地最后说，国内外的形势使我们愈来愈坚定地确信，全世界，其中包括印度尼西亚始终在转向给全世界人民带来希望的好得多的方向。艾地又说，党将肯定完成它的历史任务，不论是国内任务还是国际任务，应当更加果断地用马克思列宁主义来指导党的行动、不断地加强党同群众的联系，不断地提高革命警惕和加强民族团结，并且不放过机会发展好的、进步的东西。
