Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 7th: Prime Minister Nehru today answered questions from reporters at a press conference regarding the central government's takeover of the former Kerala state government. When reporters asked him whether this action taken by the central government was in accordance with the constitution, Nehru replied that "the actions taken by the President are strictly within the scope of the constitution and do not violate the constitution."

Nehru believed that the decision for central intervention was "democratic, and it can lead to a democratic solution through elections," and this approach was what he himself had suggested earlier.

One reporter asked whether the constant rumors of central intervention by the Congress Party and opposition leaders played a role in further exacerbating the situation. Nehru admitted that "it can be said that the possibility of central intervention encouraged the opposition's instigation movement." But he then said, "I don't like the idea of intervention." He also said, "Although we don't like many of the things that happened in Kerala, we dislike the idea of intervention even more."

When asked why the Governor's report was not published to convince the people, Nehru believed that "doing so would be extremely inappropriate." He said that the Governor's report, which formed the basis of the central government's actions, could not be published because it was a confidential document. Nehru responded to his refusal of the suggestion for a high-level investigation into the accusations against the Kerala government by saying that, in his opinion, "under the current circumstances in Kerala, a high-level investigation would certainly not bring peace, but would instead maintain the emotional agitation."

    尼赫鲁谈喀拉拉邦问题
    声称中央干涉的做法是他建议的
    据新华社新德里7日电　尼赫鲁总理今天在记者招待会上回答了新闻记者提出的关于中央接管前喀拉拉邦政府方面的问题。记者们问他，中央采取的这种行动是否符合宪法，尼赫鲁在回答中认为，“总统所采取的行动是严格地在宪法范围之内的，并没有违反宪法”。
    尼赫鲁认为，中央干涉的决定是“民主的，它可以导致通过选举的民主解决”，这种做法是他本人早些时候建议的。
    有记者问道，国大党和反对派领导人不断扬言中央要进行干涉，这是否在使局势进一步恶化方面起了一部分作用，尼赫鲁承认，“可以说中央干涉的可能性鼓励了反对派所进行的煽动运动”。但是他又说，“我不喜欢干涉这个主张”。他还说，“尽管我们不喜欢喀拉拉邦内所发生的许多事情，我们更不喜欢干涉的主张”。
    有记者问到，为什么不公布邦长的报告来使人民信服，尼赫鲁认为，“那样做是极其不合适的”。他说，构成中央行动的基础的邦长的报告是不能公布的，因为这是一个机密文件。尼赫鲁为他拒绝关于对喀拉拉邦政府所受到指责进行高级调查的建议一事这样答复，在他看来，“在喀拉拉邦目前的情况下，进行高级调查肯定不会带来和平，相反只会保持激动的情绪。”
