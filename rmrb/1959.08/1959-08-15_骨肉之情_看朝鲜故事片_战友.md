Flesh and Blood Affection
　　——Watching the Korean Feature Film "Comrades"
　　Tao Bingwei
    In our revolutionary ranks, "comrade" is a noble term. For the people of China and North Korea, it is the crystallization of friendship and a symbol of sharing weal and woe. People often use the words "as close as a family, affection like flesh and blood" to describe the militant friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and North Korean people. This is most appropriate. Through hard work and with incomparable passion, Korean filmmakers have excellently portrayed the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people of China and North Korea in the film "Comrades."
    At the beginning, the author introduces the close relationship between the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as their lofty spirit, to the audience through two meaningful scenes. Kim Ryong, a squad leader of the People's Army, although wounded, bravely covers the safe retreat of Yao Zhigang, a reconnaissance squad leader of the Chinese People's Volunteers. On his way back to camp, Yao Zhigang saves a Korean child, Kim Ryong's younger brother, Ir-ryong, from the enemy's frenzied bombing.
    From this, the story develops further and more broadly around Yao Zhigang and Kim Ryong's family. When Yao Zhigang's unit marches to the front line and passes through the village, we see an extremely touching scene. Kim Ryong's mother, Gu Sung-nyeo, his father, Kim Bok-hwan, and Ir-ryong, not to mention the village's old men, old women, sisters-in-law, young women, and children, all welcome the Chinese People's Volunteers as if they were their own relatives. The Chinese People's Volunteers also treat the Korean villagers as their own parents, brothers, and sisters. This flesh-and-blood relationship ensured our victory over the enemy. Yao Zhigang was originally a poor child from the countryside who lost his mother at the age of eight. His mother couldn't even drink a bowl of porridge before she died. Gu Sung-nyeo was also a peasant who suffered under the exploitation of landlords and was liberated after the revolution. Shared fate connects them.
    The film then depicts the joint formulation of combat plans by the commanders of the Chinese and North Korean forces and the coordinated battle to attack Mt. Ryonju by the people of the two countries. In the process of attacking Mt. Ryonju, the active support of the Korean people played an important role. They braved the hail of bullets to transport ammunition and carry the wounded, greatly boosting the morale of the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    Kim Bok-hwan, regardless of the enemy's bombing, suddenly covers the wounded Volunteer soldier with his own body in order to rescue him. Even as he shed his last drop of blood, he never forgot the wounded Volunteer soldiers. Gu Sung-nyeo's husband died a heroic death, and she was grief-stricken. However, facing the beastly enemy, she turned her grief into strength and resolutely lifted her husband's stretcher, advancing along her husband's bloody footprints. This is how the heroic Korean women, together with the men, shouldered the arduous task of defending the motherland and safeguarding peace on the Korean battlefield.
    The sons and daughters of China and North Korea finally planted the flag of victory on Mt. Ryonju in a bloody battle. When Kim Ryong and Yao Zhigang ran to Gu Sung-nyeo together, embracing her and shouting "Mother," the audience's feelings were completely integrated with those of the characters in the film, cheering for our common victory and taking pride in the militant friendship forged by the blood of the people of the two countries.
    Some details in the film are also very touching: for example, Kim Ryong's mother gave the shirt she prepared for her son's wedding to Yao Zhigang; Ir-ryong picked bayberries during the tense moments of the battle and asked his father to be sure to bring them to Yao Zhigang, all of which portrayed the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people of the two countries and revealed the characters' psychological activities.
    Thanks to the Korean filmmakers for giving us an extremely profound and vivid lesson on internationalism in less than two hours. We will cherish even more the friendship between the people of the two countries, which has been deepened and consolidated in battle, and we will spare no effort to defend it. (Attached picture)

　　骨肉之情
　　——看朝鲜故事片“战友”
　　陶冰蔚
    在我们革命队伍里，战友，是一种崇高的称呼。而对于中朝两国人民来说，它又是友谊的结晶，同甘苦共患难的象征。人们常用“亲如一家，情同骨肉”几个字来形容中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊。这是最恰当不过的。朝鲜的电影工作者们，通过艰苦的劳动，怀着无比的激情，在“战友”一片中出色地表现了中朝两国人民的亲如骨肉的情景。
    一开始，作者通过两幅意义深刻的画面，把人民军和志愿军的亲密关系以及他们的崇高精神介绍给观众。人民军班长金龙虽然负了伤，但却奋不顾身地掩护志愿军侦察班长姚志刚安全撤退；姚志刚返回营地途中，在敌机的狂轰滥炸下，救出一个朝鲜孩子——金龙的弟弟二龙。
    由此，故事便围绕姚志刚和金龙一家朝着更深、更广的方面发展下去。当姚志刚他们的队伍开赴前线，路过村子的时候，我们看到了一个极其感人的场面。金龙的母亲具成女、父亲金福焕和二龙不说，就是村里的老大爷、老大娘、大嫂、姑娘和孩子们，都像欢迎自己的亲人一样欢迎志愿军；志愿军也把朝鲜老乡当做自己的父母兄弟和姊妹。这种骨肉般的关系，保证我们战胜了敌人。姚志刚原是一个农村的穷孩子，八岁上就死了母亲，母亲临死的时候，连一碗粥都没有喝上。具成女也是一个受尽地主压榨的农民，解放以后翻了身。共同的命运；把他们连结在一起了。
    影片接着描述了中朝部队指挥员共同制订作战计划和两国人民部队协同作战攻打连珠峰的情景。在攻打连珠峰的过程中，朝鲜人民的积极支援，起了重要的作用。他们冒着枪林弹雨，出生入死地运弹药、抬伤员，大大鼓舞了人民军和志愿军的斗志。
    金福焕为了抢救志愿军伤员，不顾敌机的轰炸，猛然用自己的身体盖住伤员。在流尽最后一滴血的时候，他念念不忘的也是志愿军伤员。具成女的丈夫牺牲了，她悲痛万分，但是，面对着野兽般的敌人，她把悲痛化为力量，毅然决然地抬起丈夫的担架，踏着丈夫的血迹前进。英雄的朝鲜妇女，就是这样在朝鲜战场上同男子汉一道，担负起保卫祖国、保卫和平的艰巨任务。
    中朝两国的儿女，终于在浴血奋战中把胜利的旗帜插上了连珠峰。当金龙和姚志刚一起跑向具成女，抱着她同声喊“阿妈妮”的时候，观众的心情完全和片中人物的心情融汇在一起，为我们的共同胜利欢呼，为两国人民鲜血凝成的战斗友谊骄傲。
    影片中的一些细节，也非常动人：如金龙的母亲把为儿子结婚准备的衬衫送给姚志刚；二龙在战斗紧张的时刻采来杨梅托父亲务必带给姚志刚，都刻划了两国人民的血肉关系，揭示了人物的心理活动。
    感谢朝鲜的电影工作者们，在不到两小时的时间里，给我们上了一堂极其深刻、极其生动的国际主义的课。我们会更加珍视两国人民在战斗中加深和巩固起来的友谊，并且要不惜一切保卫它。（附图片）
