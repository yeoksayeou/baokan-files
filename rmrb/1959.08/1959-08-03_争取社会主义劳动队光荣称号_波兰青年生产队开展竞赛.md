Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to the Polish Press Agency, workers and youth production teams in some Polish factories are launching a competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

    Currently, there are approximately 5,000 youth production teams in Poland, comprising about 50,000 workers. In addition to widely participating in inter-factory labor competitions to win the mobile red banners from the Council of Ministers and the Central Council of Trade Unions, as well as the mobile red banners from various ministries and the national committees of the trade unions, workers and youth production teams in some factories are launching a new type of competition – striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

    The Presidium of the Polish Central Council of Trade Unions and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Youth Union recently held a joint meeting and adopted a draft directive on the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." This draft will be submitted to workers, trade union, and youth activists for discussion.

    The draft states that in terms of production, Socialist Labor Teams should strive for higher production targets and improve safety and labor hygiene conditions.

    The aim of this competition is to improve workers' general education level and to acquire at least a basic technical knowledge of their respective professions.

    Workers who obtain the title of "Socialist Labor Team" should pay attention to labor discipline, complete their tasks with no shame, correctly treat public property, and actively participate in the socio-political life of the enterprise and the surrounding environment.

    The directive stipulates that discussions on this draft will continue until October of this year, after which the Central Council of Trade Unions and the Socialist Youth Union will adopt a joint resolution on the principles for launching the competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

    争取社会主义劳动队光荣称号
    波兰青年生产队开展竞赛
    新华社华沙电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰一些工厂的职工和青年生产队正在开展争取社会主义劳动队称号的竞赛。
    到目前为止，波兰大约有五千个青年生产队，包括约五万名工人，他们除了广泛地开展争取部长会议和工会中央理事会的流动红旗以及争取各部和各工会全国委员会的流动红旗的厂际劳动竞赛以外，一些工厂的职工和青年生产队正在开展一种新的竞赛——争取社会主义劳动队的称号。
    波兰工会中央理事会主席团和社会主义青年联盟中央委员会书记处最近举行了联席会议，就开展争取社会主义劳动队称号的竞赛问题通过一项指示草案。这项草案将交给职工、工会和青年积极分子来讨论。
    草案指出，在生产方面，社会主义劳动队应该力求达到更高的生产指标，改善安全和劳动卫生条件。
    这一竞赛的目的在于提高工人的普通教育水平并至少获得自己所从事的专业的起码的技术知识。
    取得社会主义劳动队称号的职工们应该注意劳动纪律，毫无愧色地完成自己的任务，正确地对待公共财产，积极参加企业的和周围环境的社会政治生活。
    指示规定，关于这个草案的讨论将要进行到今年10月，这以后，工会中央理事会和社会主义青年联盟将就开展争取社会主义劳动队称号的竞赛的原则通过联合决议。
