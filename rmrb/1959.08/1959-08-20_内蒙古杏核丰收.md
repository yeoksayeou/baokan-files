Xinhua News Agency report: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved a bumper harvest of apricot kernels this year. The three major apricot kernel producing leagues, Hulunbuir, Jirem, and Ju Ud, have already produced more than 6 million catties of apricot kernels this year. Due to the superiority of the people's communes in exercising unified leadership and rationally utilizing labor, more than 50,000 people in these three leagues are participating in the collection of apricot kernels, so this year's abundant apricot kernel production has resulted in a bumper harvest.

The apricot kernels produced in Inner Mongolia are mainly bitter almonds, which have been one of the region's main export commodities for many years. According to analysis, bitter almonds contain 49.1% oil and 22.3% starch, which can be used as raw materials for oil extraction and alcohol production, and can also be used to make soap and medicines.

Apricot kernels are a seasonal product that generates significant income. Last year, farmers and herdsmen in Horqin Right Wing Middle Banner, Hulunbuir League, spent only more than 20 days collecting 2.25 million catties of apricot kernels, which they sold to state-owned commercial departments, earning 224,000 yuan. This year, under the unified leadership of the commune, they have comprehensively arranged labor, dispatching an average of 10,000 people every day for a concentrated harvest. Local commercial departments have also formed seven working groups to go deep into the producing areas to impart relevant apricot kernel production techniques.

　  内蒙古杏核丰收
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区今年杏核丰收。杏核主要产区呼伦贝尔、哲里木、昭乌达三个盟今年已生产杏核六百多万斤。由于人民公社发挥了统一领导和合理使用劳动力的优越性，目前这三个盟参加采集杏核的有五万多人，所以今年丰产的杏核得到了丰收。
    内蒙古所产杏核，以苦杏仁为主，是自治区历年来出口的主要商品之一。根据化验，苦杏仁内含有49.1％的油脂，22.3％的淀粉，可以用作制油及制酒精的原料，还可用来制作肥皂和药品之用。
    杏核是季节性强而收入大的产品。呼伦贝尔盟科尔沁右翼中旗农牧民去年仅花了二十多天时间，就采集杏核二百二十五万斤，卖给国营商业部门，收入二十二万四千元。今年他们在公社统一领导下，全面安排劳力，每天平均出动一万人突击采集。当地商业部门也组成七个工作组，深入产区传授有关杏核生产技术。
