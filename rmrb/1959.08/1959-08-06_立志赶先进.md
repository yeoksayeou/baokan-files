Aspire to Catch Up with the Advanced
Wang Pu

The workers in Chongqing's major industries such as steel, machinery, coal, and enamel are truly ambitious. More than 260,000 people are finding advanced "pace-setters" as opponents and carrying out inter-trade competitions. In just a few days, the competition has set off a new wave of booming production.

Finding advanced "pace-setters" as one's own competition opponent is a very meaningful thing. The purpose of socialist labor competition is to improve together, eliminate backwardness, and develop social productivity faster. Using advanced "pace-setters" as competition opponents is to establish a counterpoint for oneself—a living example to learn from. Here, there are not only concrete goals for struggle, but also concrete methods to achieve the goals. The entire process of competition is a process of learning the advanced experience and technology of "pace-setters," a process of transforming from backwardness (relatively speaking) to advancement. When the level of a batch of "pace-setters" is broken through by the majority of people, a new batch of "pace-setters" will appear. Always using advanced "pace-setters" as opponents, our eyes will always look forward, climbing one peak after another.

Advanced and backward are spoken in a comparative sense. It is not that the advanced are advanced in everything, nor that the backward are backward in everything. In advanced "pace-setters," some aspects may be backward; in non-advanced "pace-setters," some aspects may be advanced. It's just that, comparatively, one has more advanced things and the other has fewer. Therefore, when carrying out inter-trade opponent competitions, our eyes should first look at the things that others surpass us in, and not just look at the things that others are not as good as us in, so that we become arrogant and think that the advanced "pace-setters" are "just so-so" and not so great. Arrogance and unwillingness to learn from others is a manifestation of lack of ambition—being satisfied with the status quo. Therefore, even advanced individuals who are established as "pace-setters" should be humble and first look at the strengths of others. If I see your strengths and you see my strengths, we can learn from each other humbly, learn from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses, so that the "strong" become stronger and the "short" become longer, so that we can improve together.

Of course, we don't need to belittle ourselves, regarding the level of advanced producers as unattainable, and not daring to find them as competition opponents. In production activities, how can everyone walk on the same line all the time? Today you are walking in front, I chase you; tomorrow I am walking in front, you catch up with me. This is a phenomenon that conforms to the law. Advanced "pace-setters" are not born. The reason why they become advanced is only that they are more careful, more studious, and grasp the laws of production faster and more comprehensively in production activities than others. As the ancient saying goes: "Everyone can become Yao and Shun." We say: Everyone can become an advanced producer. Moreover, the advanced "pace-setters" have already opened up a path for us. We can also reach the production level they can reach. If the direction is right, the road will only get closer and closer, and it will never get farther and farther. As long as we are ambitious, neither arrogant nor belittling ourselves, and learn from the advanced experience and technology of advanced "pace-setters" as the 260,000 workers in Chongqing do, and move forward step by step unremittingly, we will definitely be able to catch up with them and enter the ranks of advanced producers.

Millions of workers are rising up to find advanced "pace-setters" as opponents and consciously throwing themselves into the torrent of labor competition of catching up with each other. This is a sign of the widespread improvement of the socialist ideological awareness and the widespread increase in labor enthusiasm of our country's working class. Our country's social productive forces will inevitably develop rapidly in this competition of catching up with each other.

Time has entered August, and now is the decisive season to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national plan. Many advanced individuals and units have emerged in various regions and on various fronts. They are worthy of being "pace-setters" of their peers in terms of completing output plans, quality plans, cost plans, and production safety. We very much need to establish these "pace-setters" among the broad masses of workers like Chongqing, summarize their experience, and organize everyone to learn from them, and launch a new upsurge of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. In this way, we will be able to better complete the national plan on time, in quantity, in quality, at cost, and safely in all aspects in August and September, and welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    立志赶先进
    王朴
    重庆市钢铁、机械、煤炭、搪瓷等几个主要行业的职工真有志气，二十六万多人找先进的“标兵”作对手，开展同工种竞赛。竞赛才几天，就掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮。
    找先进的“标兵”作自己竞赛的对手，这是非常有意义的事。社会主义劳动竞赛，为的是共同提高，扫除落后，更快地发展社会生产力。以先进的“标兵”作竞赛对手，就是给自己树立一个对立面——学习的活榜样。这里不但有奋斗的具体目标，还有达到目标的具体办法。整个竞赛的过程，就是学习“标兵”的先进经验和技术的过程，就是由落后（比较地说的）向先进转化的过程。一批“标兵”的水平被大多数人突破了，又会有一批新的“标兵”出现。永远以先进“标兵”作对手，我们的眼睛就会永远朝前看，攀登一座高峰再攀一座高峰。
    先进和落后，是在比较的意义上讲的，并非先进的样样都先进，落后的样样都落后。先进“标兵”中，有某些方面可能是落后的，非先进“标兵”中，有某些方面可能是先进的，只不过比较起来，一个先进的东西多一些，一个少一些吧了。因此，在开展同工种对手的竞赛的时候，我们眼睛首先要看别人胜过自己的东西，别只看人家不及自己的东西，使自己妄自尊大起来，觉得先进“标兵”
  “也不过如此”，没啥了不起。妄自尊大，不愿向别人学习，是没有志气的表现——满足现状。所以，即使是被立为“标兵”的先进人物，也应该虚心，首先看别人的长处。我看到你的长处，你也看到我的长处，彼此虚心学习，取长短补，使“长”者愈长，“短”者变长，才能共同提高一步。
    当然，我们也不必妄自菲薄，把先进生产者的水平看作是高不可攀的，不敢找他们作竞赛的对手。在生产活动中，那能人人都时时刻刻走在一条线上？今天你走在前头，我追你，明天我走在前头，你赶我，这是合乎规律的现象。先进“标兵”并非天生的。他们所以成为先进，只不过是他们在生产活动中，比别人多用心，多学习，对生产规律掌握得比较快，比较全面吧了。古语有云：“人皆可以为尧舜”。我们说：人人皆可为先进生产者。况且先进“标兵”已经为我们开拓出一条道路来，他们能够达到的生产水平，我们也能够达到。方向对头了，路只会愈走愈近，绝不会愈走愈远。只要我们有志气，既不妄自尊大，又不妄自菲薄，像重庆市二十六万多职工那样，以先进“标兵”为师，虚心地学习他们的先进经验和技术，不屈不挠地一步一步向前走，就一定能够赶上他们，走进先进生产者的行列。
    千百万职工奋起找先进“标兵”作对手，自觉地投入你追我赶的劳动竞赛的洪流，这是我国工人阶级社会主义思想觉悟普遍提高，劳动热情普遍高涨的标志。我们国家的社会生产力，必将在这种你追我赶的竞赛中，迅速发展起来。
    时间已进入8月，现在正是争取完成和超额完成今年国家计划的决定性的季节。各个地区、各个战线都涌现许多先进的人物和单位，他们在完成产量计划、质量计划、成本计划以及生产安全方面，都不愧为同行的“标兵”。我们很需要像重庆市那样，把这些“标兵”在广大的职工群众中树立起来，把他们的经验总结起来，组织大家向他们学习，开展一个学先进赶先进的生产新高潮。这样，我们便能在8、9月份更好地按时、按量、按质、按成本而且又安全地全面完成国家计划，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
