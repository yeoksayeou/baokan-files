　　US Gold Outflow and Dollar Credit Crisis
　　Yang Zhanlin
　　1. Since 1948, the imbalance of capitalist economic development has intensified. Western European industrial production and foreign trade have continued to grow, weakening the United States' position in the capitalist world economy. This situation became more prominent after the United States experienced a fierce economic crisis in 1957-1958. The United States' share of industrial production in the capitalist world not only fell from 56.4% in 1948 to 46.6%, but also experienced a serious international balance of payments deficit, resulting in a large outflow of gold, a phenomenon that had not occurred during the previous two crises.
    In 1958, the total amount of gold flowing out of the United States reached 2.3 billion US dollars. In the first half of this year, US gold continued to flow out by 837 million US dollars. In just one and a half months from April 1st to May 15th, 252.2 million US dollars of gold flowed out. At the end of June this year, the US gold reserve was only 19.792 billion US dollars, and it further dropped to 19.636 billion US dollars at the end of July, while the US gold reserve reached as high as 24.7 billion US dollars in 1949. According to the current situation, it is estimated that another 800 million to 1.2 billion US dollars of US gold will flow out in the second half of the year.
    Thus, the US gold reserve has fallen below 20 billion US dollars, which is the first time in 20 years (the US gold reserve was 17.8 billion US dollars in 1939). Due to the continuous outflow of gold, the proportion of US gold reserves in the world's total gold reserves has fallen from 70% in September 1949 to just over 50% at present, and the United States' leadership position in the capitalist world has been further weakened.
    On the surface, the current US gold reserve still accounts for half of the world's total reserves. However, according to legal regulations, the US Treasury Department must have a gold reserve of 25% of the banknotes and deposits issued by its Federal Reserve Banks, which is about 12 billion US dollars. At present, foreign governments, banks, and individuals hold another 15 billion US dollars. If all foreign countries come to exchange for gold, then the US gold reserve will only be more than 4 billion US dollars, less than half of the statutory minimum reserve. At that time, the seriousness of the situation can be imagined.

　　There are many reasons for the large outflow of US gold. A most fundamental reason is the fiscal instability and inflation caused by arms expansion and war preparation. Since the post-war period, the United States has been pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, maintaining military spending at extremely high levels. In 1949, US military spending was 13.5 billion US dollars, and in 1953 it jumped to more than 49.6 billion US dollars. Since then, US military spending has been above 40 billion US dollars every year, accounting for about 60% of the total budget expenditure. The heavy military burden has brought great difficulties to the US finances, and revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced. In the twelve fiscal years from the 1946-1947 fiscal year to the 1957-1958 fiscal year, seven fiscal years had deficits. If the deficits and surpluses in this period are offset, the total deficit reaches more than 12.5 billion US dollars. The budget deficit for the 1958-1959 fiscal year, which ended on June 30 this year, reached another 12.5 billion US dollars, equivalent to the sum of deficits over the years, becoming the highest record of US budget deficits in the post-war period.
    In order to make up for the budget deficit, the US ruling group has adopted measures such as increasing taxes, issuing government bonds, and expanding currency. The US national debt has now reached 286.2 billion US dollars, an increase of about 20 billion US dollars since Eisenhower took office as president in 1953. On average, every American has to bear more than 1,600 US dollars of government debt. Despite the continuous increase in the US national debt in recent years, the US treasury is still empty. In order to further borrow money, the US government recently raised the temporary limit of the national debt from 288 billion US dollars to 295 billion US dollars. As for inflation, it is even more alarming. In 1937, the currency in circulation in the United States was 5.6 billion US dollars, and by the end of 1957, it had increased to more than 30 billion US dollars. The direct consequence of inflation is the devaluation of the currency. At present, the value of the US dollar has fallen to 48% of that in 1940. The domestic value of the US dollar is constantly declining, but the external value of the US dollar, that is, the exchange rate with gold, has been artificially maintained at the level of 35 US dollars per ounce. This cannot but make people lose confidence in the US dollar. The continuous increase in national debt also prompts people to doubt the future of the US dollar. The rolling outflow of US gold is a sign of the increasing shake-up of the US dollar's credibility. The dollar credit crisis is reflected in the international financial market: On May 13 this year, the dollar price of each ounce of gold in the London gold market was 35.145 US dollars, exceeding the statutory exchange rate and reaching the highest peak since the reopening of the London gold market in 1954.
    The second reason for the outflow of US gold is the decline in the US trade status. In the early post-war period, the United States took advantage of the loss and weakening of the competitive power of Western European capitalist countries to actively promote economic expansion. As a result, US exports increased from an average of 3 billion US dollars per year from 1936 to 1938 to 15 to 16 billion US dollars in recent years, and even reached more than 20 billion US dollars in 1957. The proportion of US exports in the world's total exports also increased from 14% in 1937 to 32.4% in 1947. Since the US foreign trade policy is to sell as much as possible and buy as little as possible, it has created a "dollar shortage" throughout the capitalist world.
    However, this situation has undergone new changes in recent years. After a period of recovery, the economies of Western European countries have exceeded their pre-war levels in industrial production, and they have increasingly become the main competitors of the United States in the capitalist world market. US export trade has begun to be crowded out. By 1957, the proportion of the United States in the world's total exports had fallen from 32.4% ten years ago to 20.9%, while the proportion of West Germany, France, and Italy combined rose to 16.3%, exceeding the 12.7% share of these three countries before the war. In recent years after the war, although the UK's export trade has been constantly squeezed out, the ratio between it and US exports has also changed significantly, rising from a ratio of three to one with the United States to a ratio of two to one. Due to increased competition, American goods have been crowded out in domestic and foreign markets. Four years ago, the United States exported four times more cars than it imported, but now the United States imports four times more cars than it exports, and the country that exports the most cars to the United States is the United Kingdom. Under the attack of the capitalist economic crisis, US exports in 1958 shrank by 3 billion US dollars compared with 1957, while its imports decreased by less than 200 million US dollars. In addition to other foreign expenditures of the US government, such as providing "aid" to foreign countries, maintaining huge overseas troops, and stepping up the construction of atomic rocket bases overseas, the US international balance of payments has appeared a deficit. In the first quarter of this year, the US international balance of payments again had a deficit of 900 million US dollars. In the case that capitalist countries have been able to get rid of the "dollar shortage", coupled with the instability of the US dollar, many capitalist countries are no longer willing to hold US dollars as in the past, but instead, they have thrown out US dollars and acquired gold. This has contributed to the large outflow of US gold.
    Another reason for the outflow of US gold is the struggle between the pound sterling and the US dollar. In the early post-war period, the United States took advantage of Britain's economic difficulties to sign an Anglo-American financial agreement, lending 3.75 billion US dollars to Britain on the condition that Britain must abandon the Imperial Preference System and the free convertibility of the pound sterling. Britain restored the free convertibility of the pound sterling on July 15, 1947, but announced its suspension twenty days later. In March 1954, in order to maintain and restore the role of the pound sterling in international trade and the status of London as an international financial center, Britain opened the gold market to a limited extent, allowing countries with gold reserves to sell gold to Britain to increase its reserves. In 1958, the fall in food and raw material prices caused by the world capitalist economic crisis benefited Britain. Last year alone, Britain's profits from trade with underdeveloped countries due to falling prices were at least 150 million pounds sterling, which improved Britain's balance of payments and increased its payment ability. Therefore, Britain took advantage of the improvement in its international balance of payments to purchase gold from the United States to increase its reserves. At the same time, before the autumn of last year, British bank interest rates were higher, and the interest rate of the Bank of England reached a maximum of seven percent per annum last year, which prompted private capital in the United States to continuously transfer from New York back to the other side of the Atlantic, a large part of which flowed to London. Last year, Britain's gold increase was the largest, reaching 1.25 billion US dollars, accounting for more than half of the gold outflow from the United States. The gold increase in other Western European countries was: West Germany 90 million US dollars, the Netherlands 300 million US dollars, Belgium 350 million US dollars, Italy 600 million US dollars, and Austria 90 million US dollars.

　　The large outflow of gold since last year has caused a great shock in the United States. US Federal Reserve Chairman Martin said on December 13 last year that he was "worried about the collapse of foreigners' confidence in the US dollar." The US government has taken a number of measures in an attempt to prevent the continued outflow of gold.
    The Federal Reserve System Board has raised the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Banks from 3% to 3.5% since June this year. The US government is also trying to stop inflation, which is the main cause of the gold outflow. The "Inflation Research Committee" led by Vice President Nixon and directly responsible to Eisenhower has recently submitted three emergency measures to Congress to curb inflation: 1. Balance the 1959-1960 fiscal year budget and oppose future increases in spending; 2. Authorize the Treasury Department to sell government bonds at interest rates higher than the statutory maximum of 51/4%; 3. Pass a law that stabilizes prices as the goal of all government economic policies. But these measures are not so easy to implement. First, balancing the budget is of course the main way to stop inflation, but to balance the budget, it is necessary to cut huge military spending and achieve a peaceful budget, which will inevitably be opposed by the US large monopoly capital groups that have been relying on arms production to seize maximum profits. Second, selling government bonds at an interest rate higher than the statutory maximum of 51/4% can certainly recover part of the currency, but in the case of continuous shake-up of the US dollar, few people are interested in government bonds. Therefore, although the interest rate of government bonds is high, it can only provide temporary relief. Third, stabilizing prices is just empty talk before the factors of inflation are fundamentally eliminated.
    In fact, the shouts of Nixon and his like against inflation are only to gain political capital. If US currency continues to expand, the US dollar credit crisis will continue to develop. Other factors of US gold outflow, such as the unfavorable situation of foreign trade, will continue to deteriorate with the growth of the strength of capitalist competing countries. Therefore, from the US gold outflow, we can also see that the decline of the United States' leadership position in the capitalist world will be inevitable.

　　美国黄金外流和美元信用危机
　　杨湛林
　　一1948年以来，资本主义经济发展不平衡日益加剧，西欧工业生产和对外贸易继续有所增长，使美国在资本主义世界经济中的地位受到削弱。1957—1958年美国经历了猛烈的经济危机袭击之后，这一情况更趋突出。美国在资本主义世界的工业生产比重不仅从1948年的56.4％下降到46.6％，而且还出现了严重的国际收支逆差，流出了大量黄金，这是美国在以前两次危机时期所未曾有的现象。
    1958年，从美国流出的黄金共达二十三亿美元。今年上半年，美国黄金继续流出八亿三千七百万美元。仅在4月1日到5月15日的一个半月中，就流出了二亿五千二百万美元的黄金。今年6月底，美国的黄金储备只有一百九十七亿九千二百万美元，7月底再降至一百九十六亿三千六百万美元，而在1949年美国黄金储备曾高达二百四十七亿美元。根据目前的情况估计，美国黄金在下半年还将外流八亿到十二亿美元。
    这样，美国的黄金储备已低于二百亿美元，这是二十年来的第一次（1939年美国的黄金储备为一百七十八亿美元）。由于黄金的不断外流，美国黄金库存量在世界总的黄金库存量中所占的比重，已从1949年9月的70％下降到目前的只略高于50％，美国在资本主义世界的领导地位进一步削弱了。
    从表面上看，目前美国拥有的黄金储备还占世界总储备量的一半。但是，依照法律规定，美国财政部必须拥有其联邦储备银行发行的钞票和存款额的25％的黄金储备，这一数字约为一百二十亿美元。而目前，外国政府、银行和私人持有的美元还有一百五十亿，如果外国齐来兑换黄金，那末美国所持有的黄金储备就只有四十多亿美元，不到法定最低准备额的一半。到那时，情况的严重，就不难想像了。
　　二
　　美国黄金大量外流的原因是多方面的。一个最根本的原因是扩军备战所引起的财政不稳和通货膨胀。战后以来，美国一直推行扩军备战政策，把军费开支维持在极高的水平上。1949年美国的军费开支为一百三十五亿美元，1953年一跃而为四百九十六亿余美元。此后，美国的军费开支，每年都在四百亿美元以上。一直占全部预算支出的60％左右。沉重的军费负担为美国财政带来了巨大的困难，收支无法平衡。在从1946—1947财政年度起到1957—1958财政年度为止的十二个财政年度中，就有七个财政年度有赤字。如果把这一段时期里的赤字和盈余相抵，则总赤字达一百二十五亿余美元。而在今年6月30日结束的1958—1959财政年度的预算赤字，又达一百二十五亿美元，相等于历年来赤字的总和，成为战后时期美国预算赤字的最高纪录。
    美国统治集团为了弥补预算赤字，采取了增加税收、发行公债和膨胀通货的办法。美国的国债目前已高达二千八百六十二亿美元，比1953年艾森豪威尔就任总统时增加了约二百亿美元，平均每个美国人要负担一千六百多元的政府债务。尽管几年来美国的国债额在不断增加，但美国的国库依然空虚。为了进一步举债，美国政府最近又把国债临时限额从二千八百八十亿美元，提高到二千九百五十亿美元。至于通货膨胀更是惊人。1937年，美国在流通领域中的货币为五十六亿美元，到1957年底已增加到三百亿美元以上。通货膨胀的直接后果是货币的贬值，目前，美元的价值已跌落到1940年的48％。美元的对内价值是不断下降了，但美元的对外价值，即对黄金的比价却一直人为地维持在三十五美元一啢的水平上。这不能不使人们对美元失去信心。而国债的不断增加也促使人们对美元前途发生怀疑。美国黄金的滚滚外流，正是美元信用日益动摇的标志。美元信用危机反映在国际金融市场上的是：今年5月13日伦敦黄金市场上每啢黄金的美元价格为35.145美元，超出法定比价之上，而达到了伦敦黄金市场1954年重新开放以来的最高峰。
    美国黄金外流的第二个原因，是美国贸易地位的下降。战后初期，美国利用西欧各资本主义国家竞争力量的丧失和削弱的机会，积极推行经济扩张。结果，美国的出口从1936—1938年的每年平均三十亿美元，增加到近年来的一百五、六十亿美元，1957年更高达二百多亿美元。美国的出口在世界出口总额中所占的比重，也从1937年的14％上升到1947年的32.4％。由于美国对外贸易政策是尽可能的多卖少买，造成了遍及整个资本主义世界的“美元荒”。
    可是，近年来这种情况发生了新的变化。西欧各国的经济经过一段时期的恢复之后，它们的工业生产都已超过了战前水平，日益成为美国在资本主义世界市场上的主要竞争者。美国的出口贸易开始受到了排挤，到1957年美国在世界出口总额中所占的比重，已从十年前的32.4％下降到20.9％，而西德、法国、意大利三国合起来所占的比重则上升到16.3％，超过了这三个国家在战前所占的12.7％的比重。战后几年来，英国的出口贸易虽不断遭到排挤，但它同美国出口的比例，也起了显著的变化，已经从同美国的三与一之比，上升到二与一之比。由于竞争的加剧，美国商品在国内外市场上都受到排挤。四年前，美国出口的汽车比进口的多四倍，而现在美国进口的汽车比出口多四倍，而向美国输出汽车最多的正是英国。在资本主义经济危机袭击下，1958年美国的出口比1957年缩减了三十亿美元，而它的进口却仅仅减少不到二亿美元。再加上美国政府其他的对外开支，如对外提供“援助”、维持庞大的海外驻军、加紧在海外建筑原子火箭基地等，美国的国际收支就出现了逆差。今年第一季度，美国的国际收支又出现九亿美元的逆差。在资本主义国家已能摆脱“美元荒”的情况下，加上美元币值的不稳定，许多资本主义国家都已不像以往那样愿意持有美元，而是相反地，纷纷抛出美元，收购黄金。这就促成了美国黄金的大量外流。
    美国黄金外流的另一个原因是英镑与美元的斗争。战后初期，美国利用英国的经济困难，同英国签订了一项英美财政协定，将三十七亿五千万美元贷予英国，条件是：英国必须放弃帝国特惠制和英镑自由兑换。英国曾于1947年7月15日起恢复英镑自由兑换，但二十天后就已宣布停止。1954年3月，英国为了保持并恢复国际贸易中英镑的作用和伦敦的国际金融中心的地位，有限度地开放了黄金市场，使储有黄金的国家可以把黄金卖给英国，以增加它的储备。1958年，由世界资本主义经济危机引起的粮食和原料价格的下跌，使英国得到了好处。去年一年，英国在对不发达国家的贸易中，由于价格下跌所得到的利润至少为一亿五千万英镑，这就使英国的收支情况有所改善，支付能力有所增加。于是，英国利用其国际收支的好转，向美国购买黄金，以增加储备。同时，在去年秋季以前，英国银行利率较高，英格兰银行的利率去年最高时达年利七厘，这又促使西欧国家在美国的私人资本不断从纽约转回到大西洋彼岸，其中很大一部分流到了伦敦，在去年一年中，英国增加的黄金最多，达十二亿五千万美元，占美国流出的黄金的一半以上。而其他西欧国家的黄金增加情况是：西德九千万美元，荷兰三亿美元，比利时三亿五千万美元，意大利六亿美元，奥地利九千万美元。
　　三
　　去年以来的黄金大量外流，已在美国国内引起很大的惊动。美国联邦储备局主席马丁曾于去年12月13日表示他“为外国人对美元信心的崩溃而担忧”。美国政府曾采取若干措施，企图阻止黄金继续外流。
    联邦储备系统管理局已从今年6月起把联邦储备银行的贴现率从3％提高到3.5％。对于造成黄金外流的主因的通货膨胀，美国政府也在设法加以阻止。由副总统尼克松领导的、直接向艾森豪威尔负责的“通货膨胀研究委员会”最近已向国会提出三项制止通货膨胀的紧急措施：1、平衡1959—1960财政年度预算，反对以后增加开支；2、授权财政部以高于法定最高限额51／4％的利率出售政府公债；3、通过一项法律，把稳定物价作为政府一切经济政策的目标。但是这些措施实行起来却不是那样容易。第一，平衡预算固然是制止通货膨胀的主要办法，但是，要平衡预算就必须削减巨额军费开支，实现和平预算，这必然会受到一直靠军火生产攫取最大限度利润的美国大垄断资本集团的反对。第二，以高于法定最高限额51／4％的利率出售政府公债，固然可以收回一部分通货，但是，在美元信用不断动摇的情况下，已很少有人对政府公债发生兴趣。因此，公债的利率虽高，也只能救急于一时。第三，稳定物价在通货膨胀的因素未根本消除前，只不过是徒托空言而已。
    其实，尼克松之流的叫喊反通货膨胀，只不过是为了捞取政治资本。美国的通货继续膨胀下去，美元信用危机就要继续发展。美国黄金外流的其他因素如对外贸易的不利形势，也将随着资本主义竞争国家的力量的增长，而会继续趋于恶化。因此，从美国黄金外流中也可以看到，美国在资本主义世界的领导地位的下降将是不可避免的。
