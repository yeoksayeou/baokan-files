Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 31st: The Wuhan Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace achieved initial success in its first month of production. The workers of this blast furnace overcame the scorching heat and exceeded the July production plan one day ahead of schedule. The iron produced was primarily high-quality cast iron.

Entering July, Wuhan experienced a prolonged drought, with temperatures reaching over 39 degrees Celsius. Although ventilation and cooling equipment were added around the blast furnace, it was still scorching hot. To ensure smooth production after the opening of the No. 2 Blast Furnace, from the factory director, workshop director, furnace chief, foreman, to every worker of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, they fought day and night by the blast furnace, braving the high temperatures. Soviet expert Xie'erbakefu, who was in his fifties, also frequently assisted the workers in solving technical problems by the blast furnace. This ensured the high quality and high yield of the blast furnace.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 31st: Since the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's No. 1 Blast Furnace started ironmaking on March 20, its output and quality have steadily increased, exceeding the national plan every month. The July production plan was completed three days ahead of schedule, with a pig iron qualification rate of 99%.

In July, the workers of this blast furnace workshop focused on doing a good job in heat prevention and cooling, fighting hard against high temperatures to increase production. The charging workers intensified charging in the open air under the scorching sun to ensure that the blast furnace was well-fed; the hot blast stove workers increased the wind temperature to more than 1,000 degrees to ensure that the blast furnace had hot air of sufficient temperature to use; the furnace workers made preparations in advance to ensure that the blast furnace tapped iron on time. In this way, during the high-temperature season in July, it was possible to feed the furnace on time and tap iron on time for every furnace.

    武钢上钢两座新高炉
    战胜炎夏七月高产优质 
    据新华社武汉31日电　武钢二号高炉在投入生产的第一个月，旗开得胜。这座高炉的工人们战胜炎暑，已经提前一天超额完成了7月份的生产计划，炼出的铁绝大部分是优质的铸造生铁。
    进入7月，武汉地区久不降雨，气温高达摄氏三十九度多，高炉四周虽然加上了通风降温设备，仍是炎热灼人。为了使二号高炉开炉后顺利地生产，武钢炼铁厂从厂长、车间主任、炉长、工长直到每个工人，都冒着高温日日夜夜地战斗在高炉旁。五十多岁的苏联专家谢尔柏柯夫，也经常在高炉旁帮助工人解决技术上的问题。这样，保证了高炉的优质高产。
    据新华社上海31日电　上海第一钢铁厂一号高炉从3月20日开炉炼铁以来，产量、质量稳步上升，月月超额完成国家计划。7月份的生产计划又提前三天超额完成，生铁合格率达到99％。
    7月份，这个高炉车间的职工们抓紧做好防暑降温工作，力战高温增产。上料工人在炎日当头的露天，加紧上料，保证高炉吃饱吃好；热风炉工人把风温提高到一千多度，保证高炉有足够温度的热风使用；炉前工人提前做好准备工作，保证高炉按时出铁。这样，在7月份高温季节中，做到了炉炉准时进料，准时出铁。
