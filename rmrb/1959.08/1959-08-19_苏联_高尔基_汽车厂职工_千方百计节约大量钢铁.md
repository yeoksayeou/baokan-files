The workers of the Soviet "Gorky" Automobile Plant
Strive to Save Large Amounts of Steel

    (By our correspondent) The "Gorky" Automobile Plant in Gorky City, Soviet Union, in order to better fulfill the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, launched a socialist competition throughout the plant to save steel. In the first half of this year alone, the plant's employees saved more than 2,800 tons of rolled steel, worth 3 million rubles. The rolled steel saved is enough to manufacture 1,800 large trucks.

    According to the Seven-Year Plan, the output of the "Gorky" Automobile Plant will increase by 50% by 1965. This glorious task has stimulated the enthusiasm of all the plant's employees. Workers and engineers have paid attention to the issue of saving steel. Because in the case of large-scale production, even saving just one kilogram of steel in the manufacture of each car can result in saving thousands of tons of steel by accumulating small savings.

    After the steel saving competition was launched enthusiastically throughout the plant, dozens of comprehensive steel saving task forces were established in the plant's workshops. The members of the teams included workers, designers, process engineers, and foremen. These comprehensive task forces put forward thousands of valuable rationalization proposals. According to these suggestions, 138 kilograms of steel can be saved in the manufacture of each "GAZ-51" truck, 116 kilograms can be saved in the manufacture of each "GAZ-63" truck, and 52 kilograms can be saved in the manufacture of each "Volga" car. At the same time, the car's strength and durability have been increased by 20% to 30%.

    The "Gorky" Automobile Plant saves steel mainly by improving cutting methods, reducing spare parts allowance and utilizing waste materials in production. In the competition, they made good use of waste materials. Currently, many parts produced by the factory are manufactured from the edges of steel plates, which were previously recycled as scrap.

### 苏联“高尔基”汽车厂职工　千方百计节约大量钢铁

　　苏联“高尔基”汽车厂职工
　　千方百计节约大量钢铁
    本报讯　苏联高尔基城“高尔基”汽车厂，为了更好地完成七年计划的任务，全厂展开了节约钢铁的社会主义竞赛。仅在今年上半年，这个工厂职工已节省了二千八百多吨轧材，价值三百万卢布。用节省下来的这些轧材足够制造一千八百辆大卡车。
    根据七年计划规定，“高尔基”汽车厂到1965年产量要增加50％。这项光荣的任务激发了全厂职工的积极性。工人和工程师们注意到了节省钢铁的问题。因为在大规模生产的情况下，制造每辆汽车那怕只节省一公斤钢铁，结果积少成多，就能节省成千吨钢铁。
    节约钢铁的竞赛在全厂热烈展开后，工厂各车间成立了几十个节约钢铁的综合工作队，队的成员包括工人、设计师、工艺师、工长。这些综合工作队提出了千百条宝贵的合理化建议。根据这些建议，制造每一辆“加斯—51”牌汽车可节省一百三十八公斤钢铁，制造每辆
  “加斯—63”牌汽车可省一百一十六公斤，制造每辆“伏尔加”牌汽车可省五十二公斤。而同时，汽车的坚固耐久性却增强了20％到30％。
      “高尔基”汽车厂节省钢铁，主要是靠改善剪料方法，减少备件余量和利用生产中的废料。在竞赛中，他们很好地利用了废料，目前工厂生产的很多零件都是用钢板的边缘制造的，而过去这些边缘材料都是作为废料再回炉的。
