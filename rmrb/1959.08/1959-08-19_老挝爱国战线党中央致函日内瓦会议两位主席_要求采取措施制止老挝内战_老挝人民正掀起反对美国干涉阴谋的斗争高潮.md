Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - According to the "Lao Patriotic News" report, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front wrote a letter on August 9th to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd—requesting them to take measures to stop the US imperialist and its vassal states' conspiracy and actions of interference in Laos, to ensure the strict and thorough implementation of the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, and to immediately stop the Lao civil war, forcing the Phoui Sananikone government to immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front. The letter also requested the immediate restoration of the activities of the International Commission in Laos.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front solemnly accused US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government of a series of crimes, such as undermining the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, and launching and expanding the Lao civil war, and reminded the two chairmen to pay attention to the very serious situation in Laos caused by US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government. The letter stated that US imperialism has transported many military personnel and new weapons into Laos and has built many military airports and important strategic highways in Laos. The Phoui Sananikone government, acting on the orders of US imperialism, announced the abandonment of the Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue, prevented the International Commission in Laos from operating in Laos, and suppressed and persecuted the Lao people, the Lao fighting forces, and former resistance personnel. It also colluded with the reactionaries of South Vietnam and Thailand to carry out provocative and destructive activities, making relations between Laos and some neighboring countries tense. At the same time, it also attempted to make Laos join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The letter stated that the Phoui Sananikone government concentrated many troops on the Lao border and detained Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The letter then pointed out that the situation in Laos has recently become even more serious. The letter stated that US imperialism has sent a large number of new military advisors and other military personnel to Laos and has transported many new weapons into Laos. According to foreign news agencies, since July 25th, more than 100 new US military personnel have entered Laos. Some member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the South Vietnamese authorities also took the opportunity to clamor for armed intervention in Laos.

The letter pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government are part of the overall conspiracy of US imperialism. US imperialism attempts to turn Laos into its military base, to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and to prepare to launch a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The Lao Patriotic Front reiterated its position on the current situation in Laos in the letter:

One, the main reason for the current tense situation in Laos is US imperialism's interference in Laos. The Lao people demand the immediate withdrawal of all US military advisors and other military personnel from Laos, and demand the immediate cessation of the transportation of US weapons into Laos;

Two, the Phoui Sananikone government has undermined national harmony and national unity, undermined the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement. The Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences it has caused;

Three, the Lao Patriotic Front is always willing to cooperate with the Lao Kingdom side to jointly build a peaceful, neutral, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos. It was only because the Phoui Sananikone government abandoned the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement, and launched and expanded the civil war, that the Lao people were forced to resolutely rise up to carry out self-defense battles. The Lao Patriotic Front demands that the Phoui Sananikone government immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and demands a cessation of the Lao civil war and the implementation of the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement;

Four, the International Commission must be allowed to resume activities in Laos.

The letter finally stated that the Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front resolutely oppose any interference by any country that violates Laos' sovereignty. If any country sends troops to intervene in Laos, the Lao people will regard such actions as an aggression against Laos, and the Lao people will fight to the end to defend their motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - Kaysone Phomvihane, member of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and former Minister of Defense of the Lao Resistance Government, issued a statement saying: "In order to respond to and implement the line and call of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people have risen up and launched a high tide of struggle against the interference plot of US imperialism, against the Phoui Sananikone group, and against the heads of the so-called 'Committee for the Defense of National Interests'."

This statement was published in the "Lao Patriotic News" on the 11th.

Kaysone said: The current problem in Laos "is a problem between the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao fighting forces. This problem must be resolved under the supervision and monitoring of the International Commission and under the observation of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the Geneva Agreement."

Kaysone said: "The current serious situation in Laos is caused by US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone group undermining the Geneva Agreement and the Vientiane Agreement." He said: "The United Nations has no right to interfere in the Laos problem. The Phoui Sananikone government's conspiracy to submit the Laos problem to the United Nations is to allow the United States to interfere in Laos more deeply and openly. We resolutely oppose this despicable conspiracy together with the Lao people."

Kaysone said: "Regarding the Southeast Asia Group, the Lao people declare that they have never requested its support. If the running dogs of US imperialism, the reactionary authorities of any country, regardless of the Geneva Agreement, regardless of the public opinion of the peace-loving people of the world, dare to openly send armed forces to trample on our country, we, the Lao people, will regard this action as an act of aggression, and the Lao people will fight to the end to defend the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of our beloved motherland."

　　老挝爱国战线党中央致函日内瓦会议两位主席
　　要求采取措施制止老挝内战
　　老挝人民正掀起反对美国干涉阴谋的斗争高潮
    新华社河内17日电　据“老挝爱国报”报道，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在8月9日写信给日内瓦会议两位主席——苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德，要求他们采取措施，以便制止美帝国主义和它的附庸国对老挝的干涉阴谋和行动，保障日内瓦协议和万象协议各项条款得到严格和彻底的履行，并且立即制止老挝内战，迫使培·萨纳尼空政府立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由。信中还要求立即恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在信中严正控诉了美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议，发动和扩大老挝内战等一系列罪行，并且提醒两位主席注意由美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府造成的老挝当前的非常严重的局势。信中说，美帝国主义把许多军事人员和新式武器运进老挝，在老挝修筑许多军用机场和重要的战略公路。培·萨纳尼空政府执行美帝国主义的命令，宣布废弃关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，不让老挝国际委员会在老挝活动，镇压和迫害老挝人民、寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员。它还同南越、泰国的反动分子勾结，进行挑衅和破坏活动，使老挝同一些邻国的关系紧张起来。同时，它还企图使老挝加入东南亚条约组织。
    信中说，培·萨纳尼空政府在老挝边境集中许多兵力，并且拘禁了苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人。
    信中接着指出，老挝的局势最近已经变得更加严重。信中说，美帝国主义把大批新的军事顾问和其他军事人员派到老挝，运入老挝许多新式武器。据外国通讯社报道，仅从7月25日到现在，已经有大约一百多名新的美国军事人员进入老挝。东南亚条约组织的一些成员国和南越当局也趁机叫嚣要用武力干涉老挝。
    信中指出，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府的上述行动是美帝国主义的全盘阴谋的一部分。美帝国主义企图把老挝变成它的军事基地，把老挝拉入东南亚条约组织，准备在印度支那和东南亚地区发动新的战争。
    老挝爱国战线党在信中重申它对老挝当前局势的立场：
    一、造成老挝当前紧张局势的主要原因是美帝国主义对老挝的干涉。老挝人民要求立即把所有的美国军事顾问和其他军事人员撤出老挝，要求立即停止把美国武器运入老挝；
    二、培·萨纳尼空政府破坏了民族和睦和国家统一，破坏了日内瓦协议和万象协议，培·萨纳尼空政府必须对他们造成的严重后果负完全责任；
    三、老挝爱国战线党始终愿意同老挝王国方面合作，共同建设和平、中立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。只是由于培·萨纳尼空政府背弃日内瓦协议和万象协议，发动和扩大了内战，才迫使老挝人民坚决起来进行自卫战斗。老挝爱国战线党要求培·萨纳尼空政府立即恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由，并且要求停止老挝内战和履行日内瓦协议以及万象协议；
    四、必须让国际委员会在老挝恢复活动。
    信中最后说，老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党坚决反对任何国家侵犯老挝的主权的一切干涉行动。如果有那一个国家派军队干涉老挝，老挝人民将把这种行动看作是对老挝的侵略，老挝人民将为保卫祖国而战斗到底。
    新华社河内17日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会委员、前寮国抗战政府国防部部长凯山·丰威汉发表声明说：“为了响应和实现老挝爱国战线党的路线和号召，老挝人民已经起来，掀起了一个斗争高潮来反对美帝国主义的干涉阴谋、反对培·萨纳尼空集团以及所谓‘保卫国家利益委员会’的头目们”。
    这份声明发表在11日的“老挝爱国报”上。
    凯山说：目前的老挝问题“是老挝王国和寮国战斗部队之间的问题，这个问题必须在国际委员会的监督和监察下和在日内瓦会议两位主席的注视下，根据日内瓦协议的精神和条文来解决。”
    凯山说：“老挝当前严重的局势，是由于美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空集团破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议所造成的。”他说：“联合国无权干涉老挝的问题。培·萨纳尼空政府阴谋把老挝问题提交联合国，这是为了使美国更加深入地和公开地干涉老挝。我们坚决同老挝人民一道反对这个卑劣的阴谋。”
    凯山说：“关于东南亚集团，老挝人民声明从没有要求过它的支援。如果美帝国主义的走狗，任何国家的反动当局不顾日内瓦协议，不顾世界爱好和平人民的舆论，公然敢派武装力量蹂躏我们的国家，我们老挝人民就把这个行动看作是侵略的行动，老挝人民将为保卫我们亲爱的祖国的独立主权和领土完整战斗到底”。
