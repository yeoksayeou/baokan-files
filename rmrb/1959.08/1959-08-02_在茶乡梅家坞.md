    In the Tea Village of Meijiawu

    The heat makes one thirsty. If only one could have a cup of Longjing tea brewed with Longjing spring water, that would be a joy. But the sun is already setting in the west, and we cannot stop for a moment; we must hurry to Lion Peak.
    Passing through the dense forest of Longjing Temple, Lion Peak appears directly ahead. It stands head and shoulders above the surrounding mountains, its summit a sheer cliff, giving it a somewhat leonine appearance. Below the summit, green tea bushes are everywhere. Seen together, the tea bushes are like emerald ribbons draped across the "lion's" body. Many white straw hats can be seen in the green waves below the peak; these are the members of the Longjing Production Team working there.
    After breaking a sweat, we finally reached the back of "Lion." Looking far into the distance, we could see the waters of the Qiantang River, a vast expanse of misty waves, which broadened one's mind. Closer by, the mirror-like West Lake lay at the foot of the mountain, and the willow embankments and the staggered pavilions and kiosks were clearly visible. Lion Peak is so beautiful; no wonder its tea is famous throughout the world.
    The women chattered and laughed as their hands moved like shuttles. The tea buds kept "flowing" into the tea baskets. They were very generous, allowing us to choose various angles for taking pictures. Only a little girl with a small tea basket tied around her waist, who could barely walk, seemed very shy, always going around to the other side of the tea bushes, avoiding the front of the camera.
    The male commune members were weeding and fertilizing. Now it is the late stage of summer tea, and they are seizing the opportunity to cultivate the tea trees so that the autumn tea can sprout early. They happily talked about the completion of this year's summer tea plan, saying that this year's output is more than 20% higher than the same period last year. I asked them if they were confident about "autumn tea surpassing spring tea." They said firmly that the lowland tea gardens could certainly surpass it because irrigation is convenient; the remote mountain and high mountain tea areas are more difficult to resist drought, but they are still confident, and the key lies in how to strive for it.
    Turning over the back of "Lion" is the tea garden of the Meijiawu October Production Team. It was late, and the tea pickers were finishing work and returning to the village. I was an old acquaintance of theirs, and I immediately rushed over to chat with them.
    "Little Mei! How many catties did you pick today?" I went over and lifted Little Mei's heavy tea basket.
    "A few catties! Haha, not as much as you picked that day!" Little Mei deliberately "played coy" because that day, although I had put in a lot of effort, I had only picked more than 20 catties, while she had picked more than 50 catties.
    "Don't listen to this little devil; she picked more than 50 catties today, the second best in our team!" Aunt Lu revealed her secret.
    More than 50 catties, if we talk about "single-hand picking" before liberation, is probably the highest record, which should be greatly commended, but I deliberately "provoked" her.
    "Little Mei! Why can't you create a new record?"
    "New record?" Little Mei couldn't hold back. "Today we are picking xipeng tea (a more difficult tea to pick). When we picked the first batch of tender buds for the summer tea, the whole team competed and we picked..."
    "How much? More than a hundred catties?" I asked immediately. It turned out that if you exceeded one hundred catties, you could get the honorary title of tea picking expert.
    "No! No!" Little Mei deliberately hid her joy. It turned out that in this competition, Little Mei picked 285 catties in eight hours, and the quality met the standard of one bud and two or three leaves, winning fifth place. The first and second places picked more than 300 catties. The previous highest record was 160 catties, and this time it leaped to double that. These girls' nimble hands are truly admirable.
    Going down the hillside, the topic turned to the large increase in autumn tea production. Meijiawu's autumn tea last year exceeded the total of spring and summer tea. They are full of confidence in achieving the requirement of autumn tea surpassing spring tea this year, and they said in unison that there is no problem. After the summer tea "sweeping up," they will also devote themselves to tea garden cultivation and drought resistance work. Of course, they are also not weaker than the male commune members in this regard.
    In the evening, Lao Zhu and I chatted by the willow tree by the stream while drinking fragrant Longjing tea. The sound of the machines from the tea factory at the head of the village faintly came, and the loudspeaker was also broadcasting beautiful music. The summer night in the tea village is truly intoxicating.
    After a while, the loudspeaker broadcast the voice of Secretary Lu and enthusiastic applause. We quickly ran to the auditorium to see that it was the award ceremony for the double-hand tea picking competition, and the tea picking experts were receiving prizes in turn. They were wearing various colorful clothes, dressed neatly. Under the bright electric lights, these strong tea picking experts looked more energetic and beautiful.

    在茶乡梅家坞
    胡尚
    天热口渴，如能喝杯龙井泉泡的龙井茶，那是一件快事。但日已西斜，我们一刻也不能停，必须快马加鞭赶上狮峰去。
    穿过龙井寺的密林，狮峰就迎面出现。它高出一头的兀立在群山中，峰顶是壁立的岩石，看来很有点狮子的雄姿。峰顶的下面，遍布着绿油油的茶丛。连起来看，茶丛就如一条条的翠带，横搭在“狮子”身上。峰尖下绿波中露出许多白色草帽，这是龙井生产队的社员们正在那里劳动。
    出了几身大汗，才到了“狮子”背上。极目远眺，只见钱塘江水，烟波浩渺，令人胸襟顿豁。近看平亮如镜的西湖就在山脚，湖旁的柳堤，参差的亭榭楼阁，历历在目。狮峰如此的秀丽，无怪产的茶叶名传天下。
    妇女们一面嘻嘻哈哈的说笑，一面双手像梭一样飞动着。茶芽不停的“流”进茶篮。她们很大方，让我们选择各种镜头随意拍照。只有个腰系小小茶篮的刚会走路的小姑娘，却似乎很害羞，老绕到茶丛那边，躲开相机的正面。
    男社员们正在锄草施肥。现在已是夏茶尾期，抓紧时机培育茶树，秋茶就能及早萌发。他们愉快的谈到今年夏茶完成计划的情况，他们说，今年的产量比去年同期高二成以上。我问他们对“秋茶超春茶”有信心没有？他们坚定的说，低地茶园一定可以超过，因为灌溉方便；远山、高山茶地抗旱较费劲，但是把握还是有的，关键在于如何争取。
    翻过“狮子”背就是梅家坞十月生产队的茶园。天色已晚，采茶的人们正收工回村。我和她们是老相识，立即赶上去攀谈起来。
   “小梅！今天采多少斤？”我过去提了提小梅的沉沉的茶篮。
   “几斤！嘻嘻，还没你那天采得多呢！”小梅故意“卖转子”，因为那天我虽然费了不少劲，但只采了二十多斤，而她却采了五十多斤。
   “别听这小鬼的，她今天采五十多斤，是我们三队的第二名呢！”芦大嫂揭了她的底。
    五十多斤，如果就解放前“单手采”来说，恐怕是最高纪录了，这本是该大大表扬的，但我故意“激”了一“将”。
      “小梅！你怎么不能创个新纪录呢？”
    “新纪录？”小梅沉不住气了。“今天是采洗蓬茶哪（比较难采的茶），采夏茶第一批嫩芽的时候全队比赛我们就采了……”
    “多少？过了百斤吗？”我紧接着问。原来超过一百斤，就能得到采茶能手的光荣称号。
    “没有！没有！”小梅故意隐藏着心头喜悦。原来这次比赛，小梅八小时采了二百八十五斤，质量符合一芽二三叶的标准，得了第五名。第一名和第二名竟采了三百零几斤。以前的最高纪录是一百六十斤，这一下跃进了一倍。这些姑娘们的灵巧的双手，真令人敬佩不已。
    下了山坡，话题又转到秋茶大增产上。梅家坞去年秋茶超过了春夏茶的总和。他们对实现今年秋茶超春茶的要求满有信心，她们异口同声的说没问题。夏茶“扫尾”以后，她们也将投入茶园培育抗旱工作。当然，在这方面她们也是不弱于男社员的。
    晚上，我和老朱在溪边柳树旁一边喝着香气浓郁的龙井茶，一边闲谈着。村头上茶厂的机器声隐隐传来，广播器也放送着优美的音乐。茶乡的夏夜，真令人陶醉。
    过了一会，广播器传来芦书记的声音和热烈的掌声，我们赶快跑到大礼堂一看，原来是双手采茶比赛的给奖大会，采茶能手们正依次接受奖品。她们穿着各色各样花衣服，打扮得整整齐齐。在明亮的电灯光下，这些健壮的采茶能手们显得更精神，更美丽了。
