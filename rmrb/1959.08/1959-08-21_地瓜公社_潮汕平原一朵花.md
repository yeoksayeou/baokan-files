    "Sweet Potato Commune"
    —A Flower on the Chaoshan Plain
    Yin Shi
    During the Great Heat season, traveling eastward from Shantou on the Chaoshan Plain for about five hours by car, one arrives at Dongjie Commune in Raoping County, the easternmost commune in Guangdong Province. Along the road, a striking scene unfolds across the lush green fields: on one side, paddies are filled with tens of thousands of rice seedlings, and on the other, the land is covered with countless sweet potato vines. One is immediately struck by the impression that rice and sweet potatoes truly "share the world" here.

    Nestled against the mountains and facing the sea, Dongjie Commune spans about twenty li in length and breadth. To the east, beyond Mount Dabuo, lies the border of Zhao'an County in Fujian Province, and to the south, the faint silhouettes of islands near the East China Sea can be seen. For countless years, this area has been renowned for its abundant sweet potato production. Thus, "Sweet Potato Commune" has naturally become the nickname for Dongjie Commune.

    It truly lives up to its name! From spring to winter, sweet potato vines creep across the mountains and plains. In this vibrant mid-summer season, walking through the fields of Dongjie Commune, one can see the continuous growth of sweet potatoes planted in both spring and summer. The spring-planted sweet potatoes, soon to be harvested, have dense vines spreading across the ridges and fields. The newly planted summer sweet potatoes, with a few tender leaves, are neatly arranged in rows. In this commune, with only over 30,000 mu of paddy and dry land, nearly 15,000 to 16,000 mu of land are used to grow sweet potatoes throughout the year. In spring, over 2,000 mu of dry land are planted with "early sweet potatoes." In summer, "summer-planted sweet potatoes" are rotated into the 10,000 mu of paddy fields after the early rice harvest. In autumn, before the late rice is harvested, over 2,000 mu of "rice-bottom sweet potatoes" are intercropped in the paddy fields. In early winter, another season of "winter sweet potatoes" is planted on over 1,000 mu of mountain wasteland and scattered plots.

    Sweet potatoes are planted and harvested throughout the year. Braving the spring chill, farmers harvest "rice-bottom sweet potatoes" for the first time in the first and second months of the lunar calendar, followed by the digging up of "winter sweet potatoes" in April and May. After harvesting "early sweet potatoes" in July and August, they busy themselves with preparations for harvesting "summer-planted sweet potatoes" at the end of the year. The total harvest of sweet potatoes in all seasons is substantial for a commune with only 48,500 people and over 30,000 mu of paddy and dry land. In 1957, for example, the total harvest of sweet potatoes was 50,012,000 jin, averaging 1,033 jin per person per year.

    Before liberation, Dongjie Commune, despite its abundant sweet potato production, was a region severely lacking in grain. Most of the land consisted of mountain pit fields and sandy fields, requiring drought resistance if it didn't rain for three days and flood prevention if it rained for three days. Crop yields were very low, with the average yield of rice in two seasons being only about 600 jin per mu. The higher-yielding summer-planted sweet potatoes averaged only 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, while dry-land sweet potatoes were as low as 600 to 700 jin per mu. Farmers suffered from grain shortages year after year, and under the heavy exploitation of land rent, they had to borrow money to buy rice before the Spring Festival, surviving on sweet potatoes. During the spring famine, when the old harvest was depleted and the new harvest was not yet in, sweet potatoes accounted for half to two-thirds of the staple food. Many families could not live without sweet potatoes every day, with thin porridge for breakfast, sweet potato soup for lunch, and thin porridge with sweet potato slices for dinner. Even the most gluttonous children were unwilling to give sweet potatoes a second glance. Sweet potatoes, a high-yield crop, were always intertwined with the tragic fate of the farmers in the past.

    After liberation, from mutual aid teams to agricultural cooperatives, water conservancy projects were built year after year, the soil was improved, and farming was intensified, resulting in a rapid increase in crop yields. By 1957, the average yield of rice in two seasons had broken the 1,000 jin per mu mark, and the annual yield of sweet potatoes had increased by one-third. The grain situation had undergone a significant change. From 1950 to 1956, the proportion of sweet potatoes in the staple food had decreased by half. The sales of sweet potatoes increased, and in 1957 alone, the income from selling sweet potatoes was more than 260,000 yuan.

    In the year since communization, the people's commune, like an infinitely powerful giant, has grasped both rice and sweet potatoes with great force, rapidly changing the production and living conditions in the Dongjie area. Last year, the yield of late-season rice reached 556 jin per mu, and the yield of summer-planted sweet potatoes was just over 5,000 jin per mu. This year, this grain-deficient region, which annually requires the state to supply 37,500 dan of grain, only needs the state to supply 5,000 dan, basically solving the grain problem. However, the people of the Sweet Potato Commune are by no means satisfied with the status quo and are exerting tremendous efforts to strive for even greater leaps forward. The area planted with late-season rice has been expanded to 13,000 mu, ensuring a yield of 750 jin per mu; summer-planted sweet potatoes are expected to yield 6,500 jin per mu. The total planting area of sweet potatoes in all seasons will reach more than 17,000 mu, striving for a total output of 70 million jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to 1957. From the commune and the brigade to the production team, careful management of high-yield plots of "thousand-jin rice and ten-thousand-jin sweet potatoes" is also underway. In the fields of Gaozheng Brigade, in a plot of land planned to yield 20,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, the seedlings were planted just a month and a half ago, and the sweet potato vines have already grown to five or six chi long, with lush branches and leaves climbing on the wooden frames between the ridges, foreshadowing a bountiful harvest of sweet potatoes.

    Now, people no longer frown upon sweet potatoes. The vibrant people's commune feels that the more sweet potatoes, the better, and sweet potatoes are being fully utilized. In addition to being used as part of the staple food, sweet potatoes are extensively used to make starch, flour sheets, sweet potato noodles, wine, and feed. The commune has more than 100 flour mills, which can process more than 2,800 dan of sweet potatoes every day, and the products are sold throughout the province and beyond. Powder residue (the residue left after processing sweet potatoes) and sweet potato vines are high-quality feed for livestock and poultry, accounting for about 80% of various feeds here. Due to the abundance of feed, the commune is vigorously developing animal husbandry. From April to June this year, the number of pigs and poultry (chickens, ducks, geese) in the entire commune increased sharply by 38%. By the end of the year, each household will have an average of three pigs and twenty-five poultry. The commune raises more than 700 sows, which can produce more than 5,000 piglets each year. The two commune-run hatcheries can hatch a total of 1.5 million ducklings throughout the year. Let's take a look at the comparison of Gaozheng Brigade before and after liberation: Before liberation, although there were many sweet potatoes in the original Gaozheng Township, only landlords and rich peasants raised pigs in each household, and ordinary farmers could not afford to raise them at all. After liberation, each household raised at least one pig, increasing to two and a half in 1957, three and a half in 1958, and four this year. This brigade has an average of eleven and a half poultry per household this year. Last year, the income from selling livestock and poultry in this brigade reached more than 7,000 yuan. Now, Dongjie pigs and Dongjie ducks are almost as famous as Dongjie sweet potatoes. Dongjie fat pigs are all supplied to the state for export, and the market supply of Dongjie ducks has also increased.

    Dongjie Commune, famous for its sweet potatoes, has now become a model county in Raoping County with agriculture as the mainstay and comprehensive development of various economies. This summer, despite repeated wind and rain disasters, the early rice in the entire commune has basically been preserved and harvested, with a yield of 498 jin per mu. In the first five months of this year, the commune's diversified economic income was more than 810,000 yuan. In the summer harvest pre-distribution, according to a typical survey, among the 8,767 households in 21 agricultural brigades, 94.8% of households increased their income, 1.4% maintained their income, and 3.8% decreased their income. The facts powerfully show that this Sweet Potato Commune is advancing rapidly on the road to happiness, and sweet potatoes have become a symbol of their wealth and joy.

    “地瓜公社”
    ——潮汕平原一朵花
    尹石
    大暑时节，从汕头乘车向潮汕平原东部前进，约莫五小时，到了广东省最东部的一个公社——饶平县东界公社。公路两旁青翠欲滴的田野上，出现了一幅十分引人注目的景色：一边是千蔸万棵稻秧满布的水田，一边是千枝万叶薯藤蔓延的土地。人们脑海里顿时浮上了一种强烈的印象：在这里，水稻和地瓜（甘薯）真是“平分天下”了。
    背山临海的东界公社，纵横约有二十多里，东面翻过大簿山就是福建省诏安县的境界，南面隐隐约约可以看到东海近海岛屿的浮影。不知多少年来，这里就以盛产地瓜出名。因此，“地瓜公社”自然而然地成了东界公社的代称。
    真是名不虚传啊！从春天到冬天，这里遍山遍野都爬伏着地瓜藤。在这个万物生意勃勃的仲夏季节里，走在东界公社的田野上，到处可以看到春夏两季地瓜衔接生长的情景。即将收获的春种地瓜，茂密的藤叶满畦满陇地蔓延着；刚插下的夏种地瓜，伸展着几片嫩叶，整齐地排成了行列。在这个只有三万多亩水旱田的公社里，一年四季差不多一共要用一万五、六千亩土地种地瓜。春天，在二千多亩旱地上种下“早地瓜”；夏天，接着在刚收完早稻的万亩水田中轮作“夏种地瓜”；秋天，晚稻还没有收割，稻田里又要间作“稻底地瓜”二千多亩；冬初，还将在一千多亩山地坏田和零星土地上种一季“过冬地瓜”。
    一年四季种地瓜，一年四季收地瓜。农民们冒着春寒在农历1、2月第一次收获“稻底地瓜”，紧接着在4、5月“过冬地瓜”就出土了；7、8月收罢“早地瓜”，又要忙着准备年底收“夏种地瓜”的工作。四季地瓜的总收成，对一个只有四万八千五百多人、三万多亩水旱田的公社来说，数量是很多的。以1957年为例，全年共收获地瓜五千零一十二万斤，全公社平均每人每年有一千零三十三斤。
    解放以前，盛产地瓜的东界公社，是一个严重缺粮的地区。大部分土地都是山坑田和砂田，三天无雨要抗旱，三天下雨要防洪。农作物产量很低，水稻两季的平均亩产量不过六百斤左右，产量较高的夏种地瓜，亩产平均只有三、四千斤，旱地瓜每亩低到六、七百斤。农民们年年月月闹粮荒，在苛重的地租剥削下，晚稻收下还不到春节，就要借债买米，吃地瓜度日。一到青黄不接的春荒季节里，地瓜在口粮中的比重占到一半到三分之二。许多人家天天离不开地瓜，早上一顿稀饭，中午一顿地瓜汤，晚上一顿稀饭加地瓜片。连最贪嘴的小孩，也不乐意多瞅地瓜一眼。地瓜，这种高产作物，过去却和农民的悲惨命运始终纠缠在一起。
    解放了，从互助组到农业社，连年兴修水利，改造土壤，精耕细作，农作物产量迅速上升。到1957年，水稻两造产量平均每亩突破了千斤大关，地瓜年产量增加了三分之一。吃粮的情况有了著显的改变。从1950年到1956年，地瓜在口粮中所占的份量减少了一半；外销的地瓜增多，仅1957年卖地瓜的收入，就有二十六万多元。
    公社化一年以来，人民公社像力大无穷的巨人，一手大抓水稻，一手大抓地瓜，迅速地改变着东界地区的生产和生活的面貌。去年，晚造水稻亩产达到五百五十六斤，夏种地瓜亩产五千斤出头。今年，这个每年要国家供应三万七千五百担粮食的缺粮地区，只要国家供应五千担了，基本上解决了粮食问题。但是，地瓜公社的人们绝不满足于现状，正在鼓足天大的干劲，争取更大的跃进。晚造水稻扩大到一万三千亩，保证亩产七百五十斤；夏种地瓜每亩要收六千五百斤。四季地瓜的种植面积共将达到一万七千多亩，争取总产量达到七千万斤，比1957年又要增加30％多。从公社、大队到生产队，还在精心管理千斤稻万斤薯的丰产片。在高埕大队的田头，一块计划亩产两万斤地瓜的田里，插苗刚刚一个半月，地瓜藤已经长得五、六尺长，枝叶扶疏地牵爬在畦间的木架上，预示着地瓜大丰收的前景。
    现在，人们看到地瓜再也不愁眉苦脸了，富有生命力的人民公社更觉得地瓜多多益善，地瓜被充分地利用起来了。除了用作一部口粮外，地瓜大量用于制淀粉、粉片、粉条，酿酒和作饲料。全公社现有磨粉机一百多架，每天可以加工地瓜二千八百多担，产品行销省内外各地。粉头（地瓜加工后剩下的渣滓）和地瓜藤是喂养家畜家禽的上等饲料，在这里占各种饲料的80％左右。由于饲料充足，公社大力发展畜牧业。今年4月份开始到6月份止，全社的生猪和家禽（鸡、鸭、鹅）陡增38％。到年底，平均每户将有三头生猪和二十五只家禽。公社喂了七百多头母猪，每年可生五千多头猪仔。社办的二座孵房，全年共可孵出小鸭一百五十万只。不妨从高埕大队来看看解放前后的对比：解放前，原高埕乡尽管地瓜不少，只有地主和富农每户喂猪，一般农户根本养不起；解放后，每户至少养了一头猪，1957年增加到两头半，1958年达到三头半，今年每户养了四头。这个大队今年每户养的家禽平均有十一只半。去年，这个大队出售家畜家禽的收入达七千多元。现在，东界猪、东界鸭几乎和东界地瓜一样驰名了。东界大肥猪已经全部供应国家出口，东界鸭的上市量也有增无减。
    因地瓜出名的东界公社，现在已经成为饶平县以农业为主、多种经济全面发展的一个标兵。今夏，在连遭风雨灾害的情况下，全公社的早稻基本上保产保收，亩产保持四百九十八斤。今年头五个月全公社多种经营的收入八十一万多元。在夏收预分中，根据典型调查，二十一个农业大队的八千七百六十七户，增收户达到94.8％，保收户占1.4％，减收户占3.8％。事实有力地说明，这个地瓜公社正在幸福的大道上猛进，地瓜已经成了他们富裕和欢乐的象征。
