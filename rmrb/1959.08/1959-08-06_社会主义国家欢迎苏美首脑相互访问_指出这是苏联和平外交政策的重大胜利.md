Socialist Countries Welcome Soviet-U.S. Summit
Point Out It Is a Major Victory for Soviet Peaceful Diplomacy

(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency: Socialist countries unanimously welcome the upcoming mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, pointing out that this is a major victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy and has great significance for the development of the international situation.

The Soviet people hope that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower will achieve the greatest success. Moscow newspapers on the 5th published interviews with representatives from all walks of life in the Soviet Union, all of whom expressed their approval of the upcoming mutual visits.

Sedelnikov, a worker at the Ilyich Factory in Moscow, said that the upcoming mutual visits once again prove the correctness of the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence. It can be said with certainty that Khrushchev's visit to the United States and Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union will help to break through the ice of distrust caused by the "Cold War."

Bartusis, a Lithuanian writer, said that the U.S. President's visit to our country will give him the opportunity to see firsthand our peaceful aspirations and our unwavering determination to defend the cause of peace. Peace should be built together.

Seminsky, a lathe operator from Kyiv, said that we hope that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower can lead to a relaxation of international tensions and will give the ordinary people of many countries a sigh of relief, the ordinary people of these countries who bear the burden of the arms race and who are so eager for peace.

Yusupov, an oil worker from Baku, said that mutual visits can undoubtedly improve the relations between our two great powers and have a great impact on easing world tensions. We are pleased that Nikita Khrushchev has taken on this lofty mission. It is well known and cherished throughout the world that he works energetically and tirelessly in defending the happiness of the people and world peace. This visit will bring blessings to all mankind.

Parfenov, a collective farmer from the Voronezh region of the Russian Federation, said that we collective farmers wholeheartedly support the upcoming meeting between the leaders of the two major powers. We hope that this meeting will help to find a common language more quickly and understand each other better.

Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government Premier Münnich told a reporter from the Soviet "Izvestia" in Budapest that this decision proves the logic of the Soviet policy of peace. Münnich said that the leaders of Western countries should pay attention to the social opinion of their countries, and they should embark on the road of talks. Every true advocate of peace should only welcome the mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States.

German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz told reporters from the German News Agency in Geneva that we hope that this meeting will lead to a relaxation of international tensions. The German people hope that this will move forward on the road to disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction; the German people will receive a peace treaty, which is a prerequisite for the normalization of the German situation. We also hope that this will eliminate the threat to European peace, which is caused by West Germany's rearmament and the occupation regime in West Berlin.

The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an editorial on the 5th entitled "A New and Important Step in Soviet-U.S. Relations" saying that direct contact and mutual visits between national leaders are conducive to improving relations between countries, easing the "Cold War" and eliminating the threat of war. The newspaper wrote that the people of all countries believe that the upcoming visits by the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States will make a valuable contribution not only to improving Soviet-U.S. relations but also to consolidating peace throughout the world.

Romania's "Free Romania Daily" published a commentary on the 4th saying that the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower mark a turning point in the entire international relations and will substantially help to improve this relationship.

Hungary's "People's Freedom Daily" published an editorial on the 5th saying that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower are a major event with world political significance. The editorial pointed out that the mutual visits between the heads of the Soviet and U.S. governments demonstrate new prospects on the road to continued relaxation of the international situation. The editorial continued that the future is full of hope, and the forces of peace have successfully created a favorable turning point in the international situation.

Albania's "People's Voice Daily" published a commentary on the 5th saying that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower are the most important thing in East-West relations since the war.

The commentary also said that the experience of these years proves that meetings between heads of state can create conditions for solving problems and promoting the correct solution of outstanding issues.

The commentary pointed out that the Soviet government has constantly suggested holding summit meetings, and its consistent efforts to improve Soviet-U.S. relations are well known.

Bulgaria's "Workers' Cause Daily" said that Eisenhower's invitation to Khrushchev to visit the United States and his expression of willingness to visit the Soviet Union show that, due to the sharp changes in the balance of world power in favor of peace and socialism, the Western rulers who have consistently pursued a "position of strength" policy have also realized this truth and have had to come to this conclusion: as the Soviet Union has often suggested, to take the only correct path of peaceful negotiations.

The "New Germany Daily" published an editorial on the 5th saying that the direct meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower is good news, and the German people express their heartfelt welcome to this major event.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet Union has always insisted on resolving disputes on the path of negotiation with the greatest persistence and suggested that heads of government hold summit meetings. Now, the upcoming direct talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower show that the Soviet Union's suggestion to ease tensions through negotiations has been successful.

The editorial pointed out that Bonn also said it welcomes this meeting, but this is just superficial talk, a case of sour grapes. The editorial said that the fact that the U.S. President can sit at a negotiating table with Khrushchev, while Bonn stubbornly refuses to negotiate with representatives of the German Democratic Republic, shows how Bonn's policy is running counter to the train of the times.

    社会主义国家欢迎苏美首脑相互访问
    指出这是苏联和平外交政策的重大胜利
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：社会主义国家一致欢迎苏联和美国领导人即将进行的相互访问，指出这是苏联和平外交政策的重大胜利，它对于国际局势的发展具有重要意义。
    苏联人民希望赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问获得最大的成就。莫斯科各报在5日刊载了苏联各界代表的谈话，他们都表示赞同将要进行的相互访问。
    莫斯科伊里奇工厂的工人谢德尔尼科夫说，即将进行的相互访问再次证明和平共处的列宁主义原则的正确性。可以确信地说，赫鲁晓夫的访美和艾森豪威尔的访苏，将有助于凿开“冷战”所造成的不信任的冰块。
    立陶宛作家巴尔图希斯说，美国总统访问我国将使他有机会亲眼看到我国的和平愿望和我们捍卫和平事业的不可动摇的决心。和平应当共同来建立。
    基辅的镟工谢明斯基说，我们希望赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问能导致国际紧张局势的和缓，将使许多国家的普通人民松一口气，这些国家的普通人民担负着军备竞赛的重担，他们是那样渴望和平。
    巴库石油工人尤苏波夫说，相互访问无疑可以改善我们两个大国的相互关系，对缓和世界紧张局势产生很大影响。我们感到高兴的是，尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫肩负起这一崇高的使命，他在保卫人们的幸福和世界和平方面精力充沛地、孜孜不倦地工作着，这是举世皆知和珍视的。这次访问将给全人类带来福音。
    俄罗斯联邦沃罗涅日州集体农民帕尔菲诺夫说，我们集体农民衷心拥护即将举行的两大国首脑的会晤。我们希望，这次会晤将有助于更快地找到共同的语言，更好地彼此了解。
    匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫对苏联“消息报”驻布达佩斯记者发表谈话说，这一决定证明了苏联和平政策的逻辑性。明尼赫说，西方国家的领导人应该注意到他们国家的社会舆论，他们应该走上会谈的道路。每一个真正的和平拥护者只应该欢迎苏美两国领导人的相互访问。
    德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨在日内瓦向德意志通讯社记者发表谈话说，我们希望，这个会见将导致国际紧张局势的缓和。德国人民希望，这样将在裁军和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的道路上向前迈进一步；德国人民将得到和约，而和约是促使德国局势正常化的前提。我们还希望，这样一来将消除对欧洲和平的威胁，这种威胁是由于西德的重新武装和西柏林的占领制度所引起的。
    蒙古“真理报”5日以“在苏美关系中新的、重要的一步”为题发表社论说，国家领导人的直接接触和互相访问，有助于改善各国之间的关系、有助于缓和“冷战”以及消除战争威胁。这家报纸写道，各国人民相信，苏美两国首脑将要进行的访问不仅会在改善苏美两国关系方面、而且会在巩固全世界的和平方面作出有价值的贡献。
    罗马尼亚“自由罗马尼亚报”4日发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将进行的相互访问标志着整个国际关系中的转折点，并且将在实质上有助于改善这种关系。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”5日发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问，是一个重大的、具有世界政治意义的事件。社论指出，苏美两国政府首脑的相互访问在国际局势继续缓和的道路上展示了新的远景。社论接着说，未来是充满希望的，和平力量成功地在国际局势中创造有利的转折点。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”5日发表评论说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问，是战后东西方关系中最重要的一件事。
    评论还说，这些年来的经验证明，各国首脑的会见能够为解决问题和促进正确解决悬而未决的问题创造条件。
    评论指出，苏联政府曾不断建议举行最高级会议，它为改善苏美关系所作一贯努力是人所共知的。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”说，艾森豪威尔邀请赫鲁晓夫访问美国和他表示愿意到苏联访问这件事表明，由于世界力量对比有利于和平和社会主义的急剧变化，一贯执行“实力地位”政策的西方统治人物，也意识到了这一真理，而不得不作出这一结论：像苏联经常建议的那样，走唯一正确的和平谈判的道路。
    “新德意志报”5日发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的直接会见是一个好消息，德国人民对这一重大事件表示衷心欢迎。
    社论指出，苏联一直以最大的坚持性主张在谈判的道路上解决争端，建议各国政府首脑举行最高级会议，现在，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的即将举行的直接会谈表明，苏联主张通过谈判以缓和紧张局势的建议获得了成功。
    社论指出，波恩也说欢迎这种会见，这只是一种表面的话，是一种酸葡萄的心理。社论说，美国总统能同赫鲁晓夫坐在一个谈判桌上，而波恩却还死硬地拒绝同德意志民主共和国的代表进行谈判，这表明波恩当局的政策是如何同时代的列车背道而驰。
