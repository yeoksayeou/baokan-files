    The Youth Developing Hanság

    Since last summer, the Hanság region has become nationally known in Hungary with a new look. However, its reputation is neither like the beautiful Lake Balaton nor like the emerging industrialized city of Sztálinváros. Its fame is linked to labor and the participation of young students in manual labor.

    Hanság is a large swamp in western Hungary, with more than 50,000 holds (approximately 8.55 mu per hold). For many years, it has been silently submerged by water, appearing desolate and lonely. Last summer, the KISZ organization of Győr-Sopron County proposed that young people use their labor to develop Hanság and turn it into arable land. This call was supported by the Central Committee of the KISZ and responded to by young people across the country. Young people acted promptly. Last summer, young students dug canals to drain water, turning 3,000 holds of land into farmland and planting wheat. The KISZ organization not only organized young students to participate in labor, but also specifically transferred KISZ cadres to work and study here. That is to say, a short-term training course for the KISZ was also held in this swamp. This summer, another 4,000 holds of swamp are waiting for the working hands of young people.

    We arrived at the camp of the young laborers in Hanság near dusk. Four rows of tents were neatly arranged on the vast grassland. It was quiet all around, and only the sound of wind blowing through the leaves could be heard. We couldn't help but slow down our pace. When we got close to the tents, we saw young people sitting in circles on the distant grassland, studying. These are the first batch of 330 KISZ cadres from schools, factories, and rural areas to come to Hanság this year.

    What a pleasant mood the young people spend these two weeks of militarized life in! They said they had a very comfortable and meaningful time. The young people are divided into three camps, and the commanders and general commander of each camp are members of the KISZ county committee. Let's take a look at their day's life: they get up with the bugle call at six o'clock in the morning, facing the sun. After breakfast, they shoulder their hoes to dig canals. These young men started a canal digging competition on the first day! Young women either dig canals or learn crafts. In the afternoon, everyone collectively studies issues such as the work of the KISZ and the work of young people, and discusses them collectively. In the evening, campfire parties or film evenings are held. They sleep in tents. The "dining room" and "washroom" are naturally outdoors.

    Young women have also learned a lot of skills here. They proudly showed us what they made, including embroidered flowers, woven tablecloths, toys made of nylon silk skin and filled with cotton, such as small rabbits and bears, and colorful patterns painted on nylon tablecloths... They learn their skills really quickly and well, and as for the teachers, they are specially hired by the camp.

    Two weeks of military-style labor life enable young people to return to their original posts with healthy bodies, labor habits, new knowledge, and skills.

    开发杭沙格的青年们
    从去年夏天开始，杭沙格地区在匈牙利以新的面貌名闻全国了。但是它的声誉既不同于美丽多娇的巴拉顿湖，也不同于斯大林瓦罗什那新兴的工业化城市，它的名声是同劳动，同青年学生参加体力劳动联在一起的。
    杭沙格是匈牙利西部的一大片沼泽地，有五万多霍尔特（每霍尔特约合八点五五市亩）。多少年来，它默默无闻地被水浸着，显得荒凉而孤独。去年夏天，吉厄尔—索普伦州青年团组织提出建议：青年们用自己的劳动来开发杭沙格，使它变为良田，这个号召得到了团中央的支持和全国青年的响应。青年人说干就干，去年夏天青年学生们就开渠排水，使三千霍尔特土地变成了耕地，种上了麦子。团组织不仅单纯组织青年学生来参加劳动，还专门调团的干部来这里劳动和学习，就是说，在这片沼泽地上同时举办了团的短期训练班。今年夏天，又有四千霍尔特沼泽等待着青年们的劳动的双手。
    我们来到杭沙格劳动青年的营地时，已近黄昏。在那片辽阔的草地上整整齐齐地排着四排帐篷，周围静悄悄的，只听见风儿吹动树叶的声音。我们也不由得放慢了脚步。走到帐篷附近，才看见青年们在远处的草地上围坐成几个圆圈，他们正在学习。这是今年第一批来到杭沙格的青年，是来自学校、工厂和农村的三百三十名团的干部。
    青年们是怀着怎样愉快的心情度过这半个月军事化的生活啊！他们说，过的惬意极了，而且很有意义。青年们分编在三个营里，每个营的指挥员和总指挥员都是团的州委委员。让我们看一下他们一天的生活吧：清晨六时就迎着太阳随着号角声起床。早饭后，肩起锄头去挖渠。这些小伙子们，第一天就开始了挖渠竞赛呢！女青年或挖渠，或学习工艺技术。下午大家则集体学习关于团的工作、青年的工作等问题，并且集体讨论。晚上举办营火晚会或电影晚会。他们睡的是帐篷。“饭厅”和“盥洗室”自然也都是露天的。
    女青年在这儿还学到不少本领呢。她们自豪地把她们作的东西拿给我们看，有绣的花，也有编织的桌布，有尼龙丝作皮、里面装着棉花的小兔和小熊等玩具，还有尼龙桌布上画的彩色图案……。她们学的本领真是又快又好啊，至于教员，是营里专门聘请来的。
    两个星期的军营式劳动生活，使青年们带着健壮的身体、劳动的习惯、新的知识和本领回到原来的岗位上去。
