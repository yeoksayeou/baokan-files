Xinhua News Agency, Ürümqi, August 12th: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is vigorously organizing transportation forces to accelerate the eastward transport of petroleum.

The Autonomous Region's Department of Transportation has established the Xinjiang Petroleum Transportation Company, specifically engaged in petroleum transportation, and has added a large number of vehicles. In addition to the vehicles of the Petroleum Industry Ministry's Long-Distance Transportation Company in Xinjiang, cars traveling day and night on the highway from Karamay to Weiya Railway Station are continuously transporting large quantities of petroleum to the interior. Recently, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Autonomous Region People's Committee specifically studied the issue of petroleum transport to the east, and successively transferred two thousand cadres and workers and more than one hundred kinds of auto repair equipment parts from various transportation departments to strengthen the petroleum transportation front. The highway from Karamay to Weiya Station is undergoing widening and straightening projects. At the same time, half of the strength of the Turpan Auto Repair Factory and part of the strength of the Hami Repair Factory are dedicated to the maintenance of oil transport vehicles.
