    After reading "Red Flag Spectrum," I always feel that this novel is not quite the same as many works of the same type. Whether it is its artistic style or the heroic figures that appear before our eyes, they naturally evoke a simple and cordial emotion from people's hearts, making people unreservedly praise it: this is literature rooted in the struggle tradition of our people; this is a hero rooted in the reality of our revolutionary struggle. Many character images under the artist's artistic knife, like things with characteristics in life, vividly, realistically, deeply, and fully hit your heart, making you never forget them again. As long as people mention "Red Flag Spectrum," the full image of Zhu Lao Zhong, who is strong, decisive, emphasizes unity, is loyal, has courage, and dares to fight, the image of Yan Zhihe, who is simple, hardworking, and full of the small-peasant contradictory psychology formed by life's torment, the bold and enthusiastic rural girl Chunlan who walks in the market with "Revolution" embroidered on her clothes, the young generation of Yuntao, Jiangtao, and Dagui who inherit the rebellious characters of their fathers and grandfathers and embark on a new path of struggle, and even the stubborn old donkey head, Zhu Laoxing, who never gets enough to eat but dreams of getting rich and does not idle his hands, and Wu Laoba, who is heavily in debt but full of optimism and confidence in life, all immediately appear before your eyes like familiar friends in life. Without looking, you can distinguish their different character lives from their voices and smiles with your eyes closed.
    Some people say that "Red Flag Spectrum" is one of the most outstanding novels in contemporary literature about Chinese revolutionary peasants. I don't think it's an exaggeration to evaluate this novel in this way. In the tradition of classical Chinese novels, many outstanding peasant hero characters have been created, such as Li Kui, Lu Zhishen, and Wu Song in "Water Margin," all of whom possess various different character characteristics of Chinese simple peasants who hate evil. In modern literature, Lu Xun is of course the writer who is best at realistically reproducing peasant characters. However, the peasant characters in Lu Xun's pen, such as Ah Q, Xianglin Sao, and Runtu, are mostly peasants who suffered serious physical and mental harm in that era. As for the revolutionary peasant character, the heroic image of the people, what he called those who during the era of "sweeping away civility," "the spirit of fortitude only existed in the folk countryside," he did not have time to reproduce in his writings. Naturally, many contemporary writers have also written a lot of heroic figures of revolutionary peasants, but there are still few peasant hero images like those in "Red Flag Spectrum" that condense the characteristics of revolutionary tradition and real struggle.
    The reason why "Red Flag Spectrum" is well written is, of course, inseparable from the author's deep understanding and full familiarity with rural life and peasant character. This understanding and familiarity not only enriches the novel's plot content and character content but also enables the author to use artistic techniques that are consistent with the content, to reproduce his character in a simple and vivid way. For example, the meeting between Zhu Lao Zhong and Yan Zhihe in the second section, the labor scenes of Yuntao and Jiangtao in the ninth section, Jiangtao's leadership in the anti-head tax struggle in the twenty-ninth section, the depiction of the suffering life of ordinary peasants through his eyes, the pig slaughter of the old donkey head in the thirty-second section, and even the writing of the love of rural children, all not only reproduce the strong-toned life content of the northern countryside but also have unique artistic features that coordinate with the life content. This feature runs through the entire novel. Unique artistic features are always rooted in the writer's rich experience of real life. The pictures full of local flavor that appear in "Red Flag Spectrum" all show that the author's relationship with life is as close as flesh and blood.
    Of course, more importantly, the author's understanding of peasant life is not general, but deeply rooted in the historical realm of their ancestral lives and character struggles. Therefore, he was able to grasp their character characteristics so skillfully and freely. The three generations of grandparents in the novel fighting against the oppression of the landlords are written so vividly because the author deeply understands the traditional character and heroic qualities of Chinese peasants who dare to fight. Although the struggle of Zhu Laogong and Yan Laoxiang, the grandfather generation, to stop Feng Lanchi from encroaching on forty-eight acres of official land was a futile lone battle, and they inevitably died of spitting blood and their families were destroyed, Zhu Laogong's courageous struggle also illuminated the anti-resistance desire accumulated in the hearts of the people of forty-eight villages. That's why people always commemorate him and spread him as a legendary hero in oral art. We cannot underestimate this quality of Zhu Laogong that shines with the light of struggle. Although the world it illuminates is very small, it shows the precious uncompromising fighting character of Chinese peasants. Many peasant heroes in history who rose up in revolt initially aroused the determination of peasants to take risks and change the face of history from such struggles.
    This quality is summarized even higher in the character of the second-generation Zhu Lao Zhong. I once said in an article: "Zhu Lao Zhong is a peasant hero who has been tempered and forged in the sea of blood and hatred to resist the oppression of landlords. He inherited the fighting character of traditional revolutionary peasants and has a continuous connection with the characters of the Water Margin heroes. The traditional characteristics of many revolutionary characters of generations of peasants are expressed in his character in many ways, and can be called a more typical, more ideal, and more concentrated expression." This is not to say that Zhu Lao Zhong once led a more powerful peasant uprising than the Water Margin rebels, but refers to the revolutionary qualities that are rich in fighting tradition that permeate his character in many ways.
    The reason why the author was able to successfully write such a distinctive revolutionary peasant should also be said to be the result of the author's full familiarity with the historical and realistic character of revolutionary peasants. Zhu Lao Zhong, who was forced to flee his hometown and family twenty-five years ago, went out to make a living and suffered the hardships of life. When he returned to Suojin Town, he was already, as Yan Zhihe said: "After decades of going out to make a living, he made such a tough guy." The deep class oppression and blood feud made him have a simple class consciousness to unite and resist the feudal rulers, which is the character quality of loyalty of the Water Margin heroes and generations of peasants. It's just that Zhu Lao Zhong has a higher generalization. Like the Water Margin heroes and Zhu Laogong, Zhu Lao Zhong is also eager to help others, selfless, loyal, and emphasizes unity. He himself was very poor, but when he heard that Zhu Laoming, who insisted on fighting against Feng Laolan, was blind and bankrupt, and when he heard that Yan Zhihe could not afford Jiangtao's tuition due to the heavy burden, he immediately took out his hard-earned money to help them. When his good brother Yan Zhihe's family suffered misfortune - Yuntao was arrested, the old grandmother was frightened to death, and Yan Zhihe fell ill and could not afford to lose Baodi, he immediately stepped forward to take on everything, "going through thick and thin for a friend," and walked to Jinan to visit him in prison. How is this quality of loyalty less than the "generosity and righteousness" advocated by the Water Margin heroes, and the "helping others in need" of Wu Song, Lu Zhishen, and Li Kui? However, in Zhu Lao Zhong's character, there is absolutely no such blind spontaneity as Zhu Laogong and Li Kui. Although he also expressed the determination of "Feng Laolan is like a stone mountain pressing on us, we have to lift him up," he understands that to overthrow a class enemy like Feng Laolan's rock, he cannot act blindly. He must "see the mud on his legs after going into the water." Before he has the strength to defeat the enemy, he often warns his children and nephews to be vigilant and "take it to heart one by one."
    Zhu Lao Zhong's rich character characteristics vividly communicate the deep experiences of history and reality. The uncompromising fighting spirit of generations of blood feuds has tempered him as strong as steel, and the complex class struggle life of modern times has tempered him as tough as steel. The precious qualities of Chinese peasants who are rich in fighting tradition are concentrated and naturally integrated into Zhu Lao Zhong's deeply tempered character. It should be said that among the heroic images of revolutionary peasants created in contemporary literary works, Zhu Lao Zhong is still the first to have such a character with historical depth.
    Perhaps some people will say that writing a peasant in old China who was deeply affected by disaster so vividly in the struggle and with such deep and rich fighting qualities is a bit too idealized. Because even works like "Water Margin" that have such deep historical truth, some people say that "Water Margin" is basically a romantic work because the author of Water Margin idealized the fighting qualities of the Water Margin heroes too much and exceeded the requirements of realism. Zhu Lao Zhong's image certainly, like the Water Margin heroes, exudes the light of revolutionary idealism. His appearance connects the gallery of heroic images of revolutionary peasants in history and reality. It not only has deep historical significance but also has strong realistic significance. As the author Liang Bin said: "In the old society, such people were easy to approach and run towards the embrace of the Party." Through his heroic image, it shows that the reason why the Chinese Communist Party was able to stir up a modern revolutionary storm in the vast countryside is that it has a deep revolutionary tradition based on people who dare to fight. However, I think it is not necessarily a correct understanding of realism to exclude "ideal" from realism. In any outstanding works, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, especially about the creation of heroic images, reality and ideal are always intertwined. It is impossible to imagine that a revolutionary writer can create a successful heroic image completely out of thin air without a deep foundation in life. From Zhu Lao Zhong's rich character characteristics, we can see how vividly he generalizes from the historical and realistic qualities of millions of peasants who dare to resist, so that readers feel familiar with him as if they have met him before. Without this highly truthful foundation in life, Zhu Lao Zhong's image would not be able to stand up in the novel. However, it is also impossible to imagine that the creation of a successful heroic image is a simple reproduction of a certain model in real life without the ideal casting of the writer in the creative process. Because even in realistic works, life is ultimately the source of art, but art cannot be a reprint of life as it is, let alone socialist realism literature with lofty ideals! The reason is very simple. The practical role of revolutionary literature and art is to "help the masses push history forward" and to "awaken the people, inspire them, and push them towards unity and struggle to transform their environment." Therefore, "the life reflected in literary and artistic works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life." Naturally, the so-called integration of reality and ideal is not to glue two unrelated things together. Without a truly touching image, only empty shouts, that is definitely not the expression of revolutionary idealism in literary images. The integration of reality and ideal cannot be separated from the creative process of artistic images. Every true literary type must go through a process of artistic generalization and a process of typification in the writer's creative activity. In life, the writer must "observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all the masses; all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle." When entering the creative process, it also needs to go through "the process of removing the crude and extracting the refined from the rich sensory materials, removing the false and preserving the true, moving from here to there, and from the outside to the inside." It's just that this whole process cannot be separated from the generalization of vivid perceptual images, that is, the creative conception aroused by the results of "all" experiences and research, which must be condensed in individual images, specific plots, and detailed descriptions. Only by going through such a process can we create truly touching literary types. And this process is often very complicated, and it crystallizes the writer's painstaking creative efforts. Ah Q was not written all at once, but his "image" "seemed to have been in Lu Xun's mind for several years," that is to say, it was written after a long gestation process. As for the heroic types in "Water Margin," they are the result of long-term processing and creation by countless unknown authors, which summarizes the rich character characteristics of revolutionary peasants of all dynasties and also condenses the clear heroic ideals of the people of all dynasties. Tolstoy's "War and Peace" was also fully prepared and brewed. "Sevastopol Stories" and "Two Hussars" are the prototype products of the long gestation process of "War and Peace." Of course, there are other examples, such as Tolstoy's "Living Corpse" and "Resurrection," Gogol's "The Overcoat," Pushkin's "The Queen of Spades," and Turgenev's "Mumu." The prototypes of life were originally some accidental events and did not reflect typical social conflicts, but after the writer's transformation, they became characters and plots with typical significance (see Dobin's "On the Typification and Refinement of Plots"). On the surface, this seems to be the effect of the writer's momentary inspiration, but in fact, it is only that this accidental event aroused the writer's long-term experience and accumulation of knowledge of life. Therefore, his transformation has typical social significance. Naturalism is not popular in the typical creation process. Every type is not a reprint of life as it is but is a re-created artistic image through the writer's subjective role (the selection, refinement, and casting of the reflection of real life). Although it is a broad generalization of life, the generalization itself shows the role of the writer's thought. To regard the requirement of realism to truthfully reflect life as a simple reprint of life, excluding the writer's ideals and imagination, that is not realistic literature and does not conform to the laws of typical creation. The reason why some of our works cannot be touching and are so superficial is of course because the writer's understanding of life is not deep, but at the same time, it is also because they lack their own spiritual soul. Even in the process of understanding life, it is impossible to gain anything without the writer's "thinking role." In artistic generalization, the writer's reasonable exaggeration and imagination play a role in the process of typification, although it does not necessarily completely contain the writer's ideals, but in the process of creating heroic images, the writer's ideals are the main characteristics of reasonable exaggeration and typification of imagination, and it does not violate the laws of typical creation at all. Because this ideal is not an empty fantasy but is generated by the writer from rich life experiences.
    The reason why "Red Flag Spectrum" is well written is also inseparable from the author's painstaking creative efforts. The author has an article "Talking about the Creation of 'Red Flag Spectrum'." It is worth reading. In this article, the author describes his creative process in detail, which is very helpful for people to understand the formation process of the characters and plots of "Red Flag Spectrum" and to understand a writer's delicate creative conception. "Red Flag Spectrum," like many successful works, was not written all at once. It went through a long period of brewing and revision. The author made long-term explorations and attempts on many of the characters and plots. We can see how effective the writer's deliberation played in developing his character conception in this process.
    Taking the image of Zhu Lao Zhong as an example, what the author initially came into contact with was just an old man who had lost three Communist Party sons but was very optimistic and strong: "The old man's experience was too tragic! But his attitude was very strong and did not give people a pessimistic and desperate impression. His image made me unforgettable for a long time. This is the beginning of my creation of the image of Zhu Lao Zhong in 'Red Flag Spectrum'." In this long-unforgettable excited mood, the author "wrote the short story 'The Father of Three Bolsheviks' based on the old man's experience." Although we have not seen this short story, according to the author's own narrative, we can see that its main content is still to describe the heroic struggle deeds of the old man's sons. Zhu Lao Zhong's character was not the focus of the author's portrayal in this short story. Later, the author also wrote the script "Thousand Miles of Dike," which still focused on the struggles of the sons. Only in the transformation of that initial short story into a novella did we see the author's detailed description of Zhu Lao Zhong's life experience and struggle: "...writing Zhu Lao Zhong as someone who had been to Guandong, dug ginseng, and panned for gold, and was someone who had a lot of experience and knowledge. ...writing about Dagui joining the Communist Party in the Great Revolution, being arrested during the 'April 12' coup, Zhu Lao Zhong walking south to visit him in prison, ...writing about Ergui's sacrifice in the Gao Li Riot; and Sanggui joining the Anti-Japanese Movement and being killed by an internal traitor as the captain of the self-defense force in the district. The old man had different opinions from the county party committee on the issue of exposing the internal traitor and came to the Hebei-Central District Party Committee to appeal..." Later, the author repeatedly wrote about Zhu Lao Zhong's various qualities in many short stories and scripts. There is no doubt that in the creative process of these works, that initial excitement was still playing a role. Perhaps the center of many works was not to write about Zhu Lao Zhong, but the image of Zhu Lao Zhong, which was "unforgettable for a long time," has always lived in the writer's creative conception. What was aroused by being unforgettable for a long time was the constant reflection and exploration of Zhu Lao Zhong's life and character. However, according to the author's narrative, in this stage, the author's writing of Zhu Lao Zhong was still limited to the scope of personal experience, testing Zhu Lao Zhong's character in personal experience. Although the novella expressed one side of his chivalrous character, it was still not sufficient. It was not until "Red Flag Spectrum" that the plot of this personal experience was completely transformed. Personal experience is only the history of forming his traditional fighting character: "'Red Flag Spectrum' added a prologue at the beginning... In this way, Zhu Lao Zhong was placed in an environment of strong class conflict from an early age, writing about the conflict between Zhu Laogong and Feng Laolan, who soon died of spitting blood, writing about his sister being raped, and then writing about him running away with an irreconcilable hatred... Digging ginseng and panning for gold in Guandong, accumulating some money, returning home to establish a career, and preparing to take revenge." As for the real experience, it was transferred to another family (and the revolutionaries were not killed); this broke through the limitations of the original old man's personal experience of dying sons and still retained and enriched the original old man's character characteristics (walking to Jinan on foot was to go through thick and thin for a friend, and risking going to Baoding Second Normal School to rescue Zhang Jiaqing was for the revolution), making Zhu Lao Zhong's character radiate the brilliant light of fighting character that communicates history and reality that we talked about earlier.
    Why did the author keep deepening Zhu Lao Zhong's character? Although the author explained the various specific considerations of the plot and character needs, according to my opinion, what played a core role in the creative conception was mainly the great character of the strong and optimistic Chinese revolutionary peasant who had been exciting the author with the old man who had lost his son. This "great character" not only contained the traditional fighting spirit but also reflected the dazzling light emitted by the revolutionary ideals in an elderly peasant. Of course, all of this may not be what the author saw only from this old man. Maybe he had seen many old men of the same type who shared this excellent quality, but maybe the author only saw this quality among a few people and aroused the author's ideal of creating a revolutionary heroic type of Chinese peasants; as the author said: "...Chinese peasants have had lofty qualities of diligence, thrift, bravery, and kindness since ancient times. For thousands of years, many brave and intelligent peasant heroes have emerged in the history of Chinese revolution. Therefore, I believe that the shaping of the typical Chinese peasant hero should be as perfect as possible and as ideal as possible. If the Chinese Communist Party did not rely on the great Chinese peasants, this powerful ally, and if the Chinese peasants did not have such a strong rebellious character, an unyielding spirit, and noble qualities of bravery and wisdom, it would not be possible to defeat the ruling class." Then, the author's ideal of a heroic image, even if it was only discovered from a few people, also has deep typical significance because it sharply and prominently reflects the typical features of the traditional and real fighting spirit of Chinese peasants. This is just like what Chairman Mao saw in Lu Xun: "The bones are the hardest, and he does not have the slightest slavish and flattering bones," which is the "most precious character of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries." From a rebellious son and traitor of the feudal class to a revolutionary democrat who advocated the liberation of individuality, and finally to a great communist fighter, this is not the life path taken by every old generation intellectual who was born in the feudal class and received a bourgeois education. Even if they came over, they did not necessarily have such strong, concentrated, and sharp combativeness as expressed in Lu Xun. Therefore, even if it is "rare," it cannot become a type because it inherits the tradition and shows the heroic figures who will win in the future. It must be known that a type is not equal to a statistical average. Being good at keenly capturing and excavating the new qualities that shine with the light of revolutionary idealism from ordinary people, even if it is only a bud but has the powerful force of new life, is the responsibility of revolutionary writers and the most important feature that distinguishes revolutionary literature from old literature. The author of "Red Flag Spectrum" is precisely because the ideal of revolutionary heroism was aroused from that strong old man that he constantly developed and deepened Zhu Lao Zhong's character. Because the initial artistic treatment only recorded the heroic struggle deeds of the sons, it could not answer his "unforgettable for a long time" about the old man's strong character. And to excavate the vitality of this potential character of the strong old man, we cannot but explore the disastrous but unyielding peasant struggle in old China, and we cannot but explore the unique life experience that specifically formed the old man's character. Therefore, in Zhu Lao Zhong's life experience, the author integrated the story of Zhu Laogong's riot in Liushulin that he heard in his childhood. At the same time, in this plot of blood and hatred, he generalized the story of bankrupt peasants in Hebei and Shandong wandering in Guandong (Northeast), which made the old man's strong character get a perfect answer. Moreover, on such a "material" basis, he also created a broad spiritual realm of history and reality for the enrichment and development of this heroic character. Of course, those qualities that shine with the light of struggle in Zhu Lao Zhong's image are not necessarily possessed by all elderly peasants who are experiencing the storms of the times. However, what is concentrated on him is the most precious character characteristic of Chinese peasants. It is precisely because of this that the author can combine it with the deep theme of "Red Flag Spectrum" - the blood feud and struggle of generations of peasants can only be thoroughly turned over and victorious under the leadership of the Communist Party - and complete the true connection of the spectrum of struggle and revolutionary heroes. In such a painstakingly created typical character, there is naturally no doubt that it integrates the writer's revolutionary ideals. However, this revolutionary ideal is based on a solid and deep foundation of life. The history of the heroic struggle of Chinese peasants in the past and present has the right to make demands on writers to create realistic and profound typical peasant heroes, and writers in the new era also have the obligation to meet this demand. The image of Zhu Lao Zhong is only a preliminary answer to this historical task.
    Our literature certainly needs realism that highly truthfully reflects life, but that is revolutionary realism, not crawling naturalism that pretends to be realism because crawling naturalism looks at life with short-sightedness. The glorious and splendid revolutionary reality cannot be truthfully reflected there. Our literature certainly needs revolutionary romanticism (or revolutionary idealism) because the revolutionary reality has given writers the wings to fully unfold revolutionary ideals. However, revolutionary idealism is not equal to empty shouts, let alone vulgar exaggeration. It must have a solid and deep foundation in life. The integration of reality and ideal in the artistic creation process is the true characteristic of our revolutionary literature. In this regard, "Red Flag Spectrum," especially the creation of Zhu Lao Zhong's image, provides a reference example and also provides a reference experience.

    谈“红旗谱”中朱老忠的形象创造
　　李希凡
    读过“红旗谱”以后，总觉得这本小说和许多同类型的作品不很相同，无论是它的艺术风格，或者是浮现在眼前的那些英雄群像，都自然地从人们的内心里唤起一种朴实亲切的感情，使人毫不夸张地赞赏它：这是生根于我们人民的斗争传统里的文学；这是生根于我们革命斗争的现实基础上的英雄。在作家的艺术雕刀下的不少人物形象，都像生活中富有特征的事物一样，鲜明、生动、深刻而又丰满地打进你的心灵，使你再也不会忘掉。只要人们一提起“红旗谱”来，坚强、果断、重团结、讲义气、有胆识、勇于斗争的朱老忠的丰满的形象，深沉的性格，朴实、勤劳而又充满了由生活折磨而形成的小农矛盾心理的严志和的形象，泼辣、热情带着
  “革命”绣字走在市集上的农村姑娘春兰，继承着父祖两代的反抗性格又走上了新的斗争道路的年轻的一代运涛、江涛、大贵，甚至像顽固不化的老驴头，终年不得温饱而却梦想发家致富两手不闲的朱老星、债台高垒对生活却充满了乐观、信心的伍老拔，都像生活中的熟朋友一样，立刻出现在你的眼前，用不着去看，闭着眼睛也可以从他们的声音笑貌里，分辨出他们各自不同的性格生命。
    有人说，“红旗谱”是当代文学里写中国革命农民的最出色的小说之一。这样来估价这本小说，我看并不过分。在中国古典小说的传统里，曾经创造出不少出色的农民英雄性格，像“水浒”里的李逵、鲁智深、武松，都富有嫉恶如仇的中国质朴农民的各种不同的性格特色。在现代文学中间，鲁迅当然是最擅长于真实地再现农民性格的作家。但是，鲁迅笔下的农民性格，像阿Q、祥林嫂、闰土等，大多数还是那个时代肉体上、精神上受到严重戕害的农民，至于革命的农民性格，他所谓的在
  “斯文扫地”的年代里，“刚强之气仅存于草野民间”的人民的英雄形象，在他的笔下还没有来得及再现出来。自然当代许多作家，也写了不少革命农民的英雄人物，但是，也仍然少有“红旗谱”里这样的凝结着革命传统和现实斗争性格特色的农民英雄形象。
    “红旗谱”所以写得好，当然首先是和作者对于农村生活、农民性格的深刻了解和充分熟悉分不开的，这种了解和熟悉不仅充实了小说的情节内容和人物性格内容，而且使得作者能够运用和内容相一致的艺术笔触，朴素而又生动地再现他的人物性格。像第二节写朱老忠和严志和的会面，第九节写运涛、江涛的劳动场面，二十九节写江涛领导反割头税斗争，通过他的眼睛描绘出来的普通农民的苦难生活，三十二节写老驴头的杀猪，以至于写农村小儿女的爱情，都不仅再现了浓重色调的北方农村的生活内容，而且富有和生活内容相协调的独创的艺术特色，这种特色是贯串在整本小说里的。独创的艺术特色，总是生根于作家的真实生活的丰富体验里，“红旗谱”里出现的充满了乡土气息的画面，都说明了作者和生活的关系是血肉般的密切。
    当然，更重要的是，作者对于农民生活的了解并不是一般的，而且是深入到他们祖祖代代的生活和性格的斗争的历史境界里去，因此，才使得他能那样熟练自如地把握他们的性格特征。小说中祖孙三代的反抗地主压迫的斗争，所以写得这样生龙活虎，就是由于作者深刻地了解中国农民勇于斗争的传统性格和英雄品质。祖父一代的朱老巩、严老祥，为阻拦冯兰池侵夺四十八亩官地的斗争，虽然是无济于事的孤军奋战，最后难免吐血而死，家破人亡，但是，朱老巩的见义勇为的斗争行动，也照亮了四十八村人民蕴积在心头的反抗愿望，所以人们才永远纪念着他，把他作为传奇英雄在口头艺术中间流传着。不能看轻朱老巩身上的这种闪亮着斗争光芒的品质，尽管它所照出的天地非常狭小，它却表现了中国农民可宝贵的不屈服的斗争性格。历史上许多揭竿而起的农民英雄，最初都是从这样的斗争里唤起农民挺而走险的决心，改变历史面貌的。
    这种品质在第二代朱老忠的性格里，就概括得更高了。我在一篇文章里曾经说过：“朱老忠，是一个在血泊恨海里经过千锤百炼而熔铸起来的反抗地主压迫的农民英雄，他继承了传统革命农民的斗争性格，和水浒英雄们的性格有着一脉相承的联系，世代农民许多革命性格的传统特色，在他的性格里，都有着多方面的表现，而且可以称得起是更典型、更理想、更集中的表现”这不是说朱老忠曾经领导过比水浒义军更为强大的农民起义，而是指的渗透在他的性格里那种富于斗争传统的多方面的革命品质。
    作者所以能写成功这样一个富有特色的革命农民，也应该说是作者充分熟悉革命农民的历史和现实性格的结果。二十五年前被逼得家破人亡逃往他方的朱老忠，闯荡江湖受尽痛苦生活的磨炼，再回到锁井镇来的时候，已经是一个像严志和所说的：“出去闯荡了几十年，闯了个这样的硬汉子。”深重的阶级压迫的血仇，使他有了朴素的团结起来反抗封建统治者的阶级意识，也就是水浒英雄和世代农民的重义的性格品质。只是在朱老忠的身上，有了更高的概括。像水浒英雄和朱老巩一样，朱老忠也是急公好义，舍己为人，讲义气，重团结的。他自己本来很穷，但一听说和冯老兰坚持斗争的朱老明瞎了眼而且破了产，一听说严志和由于沉重的负担，拿不出江涛上学的钱来，立刻就拿出自己的血汗钱来援助他们。当他的好兄弟严志和家里遭了横祸——运涛被捕，老祖母惊吓而死，严志和失去宝地一病不起，他立刻挺身出来承担一切，“为朋友两胁插刀”，徒步走到济南去探监。这种重义的品质，何减于水浒英雄所推崇的
  “仗义疏财”，武松、鲁智深、李逵的“路见不平，拔刀相助”？但是，在朱老忠的性格里，又绝对没有朱老巩和李逵那样盲动的自发性，他虽然也表示过：“冯老兰就是像一座石头山压在咱的身上，也得揭他两过子”的复仇的决心，他却懂得要搬倒冯老兰这样的阶级敌人的磐石，是不能盲动的，要“出水才看两腿泥”，在没有具备战胜敌人的力量以前，他时常告诫他的子侄们，要警惕着他，“一个个要拿心记”。
    朱老忠丰富的性格特色，很鲜明地交流着历史和现实的深刻经历，世代血仇的不屈服的斗争精神，把他陶冶得像钢一样的坚，现代的复杂的阶级斗争生活，又把他锻炼得像钢一样的韧。中国农民富有斗争传统的可宝贵的品质，在朱老忠的身上，是集中而又自然地融合在他的久经锻炼的深沉的性格里。应该说，在当代文学作品所创造的革命农民的英雄形象里，具有如此历史深度的性格，朱老忠还是第一个。
    也许有人会说，把一个灾难深重的旧中国的农民，写得在斗争中如此生龙活虎，具有如此深刻丰富的斗争品质，是不是有点太理想化了。因为像“水浒”具有那样的深刻历史真实的作品，都有人在那里说，“水浒”基本上属于浪漫主义作品，原因是水浒作者把水浒英雄的斗争品质太理想化了，超越了现实主义的要求。朱老忠的形象当然像水浒英雄一样，散发着革命理想主义的光芒。他的出现，把历史和现实的革命农民英雄形象的画廊联接起来了，它不仅具有深刻的历史意义，而且具有强烈的现实意义，像作者梁斌所说的：“在旧社会来说，这样的人就容易靠近，奔向党的怀抱。”透过他的英雄形象，显示了中国共产党所以能在广大农村掀起现代革命的风暴，是有着勇于斗争的人民的深厚革命传统基础的。不过，我以为把“理想”排除到现实主义之外，这未必是对现实主义的正确理解。在古今中外任何杰出的作品里，尤其是关于英雄形象的创造，现实和理想永远是交融在一起的。不可能设想，一个革命作家能够创造出成功的英雄形象，完全是凭空的捏造，而没有深厚的生活基础。从朱老忠的丰富的性格特色里，我们看得出来，它从千百万农民勇于反抗的历史和现实的品质中间概括出多么生动的性格特征，以致使读者一接触他，就仿佛似曾相识那样地熟悉他。没有这种高度生活真实性的基础，朱老忠的形象就不能在小说里站起来。但是，也同样不能设想，一个成功的英雄形象的创造，就是现实生活中的某个模特儿的简单的复写，在创作过程里，没有经过作家的理想的熔铸。因为即使在现实主义作品里，生活也毕竟是艺术的源泉，而艺术却不可能是生活原样的再版，何况是有崇高理想的社会主义现实主义文学！理由很简单，革命的文学艺术的实际作用，是要“帮助群众推动历史的前进”，要“使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境”，所以“文艺作品中反映出来的生活，却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高、更强烈，更有集中性，更典型、更理想”。自然，所谓现实和理想的交融，也并非把两个不相干的东西粘合在一起，缺乏真实感人的形象，只有空洞的叫喊，那绝不是文学形象中的革命理想主义的表现。现实和理想的融合，都是离不开艺术形象的创造过程的。每一个真正的文学典型，在作家的创作活动里，都要经历一个艺术概括的过程，典型化的过程。在生活中间，作家要“观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众；一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式”，在进入创作过程的时候，它也同样需要经过“将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精，去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫”，只不过这一切过程都不能离开生动的感性形象的概括，即那“一切”体验研究的成果所唤起来的创作的构思，在这里，都要凝结在个别的形象、具体的情节、详尽的细节描写里。只有经历这样一个过程，才能创造出真正感人的文学典型。而这个过程往往是非常复杂的，其中都结晶着作家的刻苦经营的创作甘苦。阿Q不是一下子就写出来的，而是他的“影像”在鲁迅的“心目中似乎确已有了好几年”，也就是说，经过了一个长期孕育过程才写出来的。至于“水浒”中的那些英雄典型，更是经过无数不知名的作者长期加工创造的成果，其中概括了历代革命农民的丰富的性格特色，也凝结着历代人民的鲜明的英雄理想。托尔斯泰的“战争与和平”也是做了充分的准备和酝酿，“塞伐斯托波尔故事”，“两个骠骑兵”，就是“战争与和平”长期孕育过程的雏型产品。当然也有别样的例子，像托尔斯泰的“活尸”、“复活”，果戈里的“外套”，普希金的“黑桃皇后”，屠格涅夫的“木木”，生活的原型本来都是一些偶然的事件，并没有反映出典型的社会冲突，但是，经过作家一改造，却成了富有典型意义的人物和情节（请参看多宾的
  “论情节的典型化与提炼”）。表面看起来，这似乎是作家刹那间灵感的效果，实际上却只是这偶然的事件唤起了作家对于生活长期体验、认识积累的成果，因此，才使得他的改造，具有典型社会意义。在典型创作过程里，自然主义是吃不开的。每一个典型都不是生活原样的再版，而都是通过作家的主观作用（对现实生活反映的选择、提炼、熔铸）重新创造出来的艺术形象。其中虽然是对生活进行了广泛的概括，而概括本身就显示了作家思想的作用。把现实主义的真实地反映生活的要求，看成是简单的生活再版，排除作家的理想和想像，那不是现实主义文学，也不符合典型创造的规律。我们有一些作品之所以不能动人，所以那样浅薄，当然是由于作家对生活的认识不深刻，但同时也是由于缺少作家自己的思想灵魂，即使是在认识生活的过程里，离开了作家的“思考作用”，也是不可能有所收获的。在艺术概括中间，作家的合理的夸张和想像，在典型化过程所起的作用，虽然并不一定完全是包含着作家的理想，但是，在英雄形象的创造过程里，作家的理想却是合理的夸张、想像的典型化的主要特征，它是一点也不违背典型创造的规律的。因为这种理想，并不是空虚的幻想，而是作家从丰富的生活体验里生发出来的。
      “红旗谱”之所以写得好，这也是和作者的刻苦经营的创作甘苦分不开的。作者有一篇“漫谈‘红旗谱’的创作”。是值得读一读的。在这篇文章里，作者详细地叙述了他的创作经过，很有助于人们了解“红旗谱”人物情节的形成过程，了解一个作家的细腻的创造性的构思。“红旗谱”像许多成功的作品一样，也不是一下子就写出来的，它经过长期的酝酿、修改过程，作者对于其中许多人物和情节作过长时间的探索和尝试，我们可以看出，在这个过程里，作家的深思熟虑在发展他的人物性格的构思里，起了怎样有效的作用。
    就以朱老忠的形象来看，最初作家所接触的，只不过是一个死了三个共产党员儿子却非常乐观、刚强的老人：“老人的遭遇太悲惨了！可是他的态度却表现得非常刚强，并不给人一种悲观绝望的印象。他的形象使我久久不忘。这是我创造‘红旗谱’中朱老忠这个形象的开始。”在这种久久不忘的激动的心情里，作者“根据老人的遭遇，写了短篇‘三个布尔什维克的爸爸’，”这个短篇我们虽然没有看到，根据作者自己的叙述，我们可以看出，其主要内容还是描写老人的儿子们的英勇斗争的事迹，朱老忠的性格在这个短篇里还不是作者刻画的中心。其后，作者还写过剧本“千里堤”，仍然是以儿子们的斗争为中心，只有在那最初的短篇改成中篇里，我们才看到作者详细描写朱老忠的身世经历和斗争：“……把朱老忠写成下过关东，挖过参，淘过金，是个阅历多，见识广的人。……写大贵在大革命中参加了共产党，‘四一二’政变时被捕，朱老忠步行南下探监，……写二贵在高蠡暴动中牺牲；三贵参加了抗日运动，在区里做自卫大队长被内奸杀害。老人在揭发内奸的问题上与县委有不同意见，来到冀中区党委申诉。……”其后，作者在不少短篇和剧本里还一再写到朱老忠的各方面的品质，没有疑问，在这些作品的创作过程里，那最初的激动仍然在起作用，也许许多作品的中心都不是在写朱老忠，但是，“久久不忘”的朱老忠的形象，却一直活在作家的创作构思里，久久不忘所引起来的，是对于朱老忠的生活和性格的不断的深思和探索，不过，根据作者叙述的情况来看，在这一阶段里，作者写朱老忠仍然是局限在个人遭遇的范围内，在个人遭遇中间考验朱老忠的性格，中篇虽然表现了他的侠义性格的一面，也还不够充分。直到“红旗谱”里，这种个人遭遇的情节才经过了彻底的改造。个人遭遇只是形成他的传统斗争性格的历史：“‘红旗谱’开头加写了楔子……这样就把朱老忠从小就放进强烈的阶级冲突的环境中，写朱老巩和冯老兰冲突，不久吐血身亡，写他姐姐被强奸，然后又写他怀着不共戴天之仇逃走……在关东挖参、淘金，积了一些钱，回来安家立业，准备报仇。”至于现实的遭遇，却转移到另一家（而且也没有把革命者处理死）；这就冲破了原有的老人死儿子的个人遭遇的局限性，而仍然保留和丰富了原来老人的性格特色，（徒步上济南是两胁插刀为朋友，冒险上保定二师，搭救张嘉庆，是为了革命）使朱老忠这个人物焕发出我们前面谈到的那种交流着历史和现实斗争性格的灿烂的光采。
    作者为什么要这样不断地深化朱老忠的性格呢？作者虽然说明了情节和人物性格需要的种种具体的考虑，但是，据我想，在创作构思里起着核心作用的，主要的还是激动着作者的那死了儿子的老人的刚强、乐观的中国革命农民的伟大品格，这种“伟大品格”既蕴蓄着传统的斗争精神，又辉映着现实的革命理想在一个老年农民身上所散发出的耀眼的光芒，当然，这一切并不一定是作者只从这一个老人身上看到的，也许他看过许多同类型的老人，都共有这种优秀品质，但是，也许作者只是从少数人中间看到了这种品质，唤起了作者创造中国农民的革命英雄主义典型的理想；像作者所说的：“……中国农民自古以来就有着勤劳、俭朴、勇敢、善良的崇高品质，几千年来，在中国革命的历史上，涌现了许多有勇有智的农民英雄，因此，我认为对于中国农民英雄的典型的塑造，应该越完善越好，越理想越好。如果中国共产党不是依靠伟大的中国农民这个强大的同盟军，如果中国农民不是具有那样坚强的反抗性格，不屈不挠的精神，和有勇有智的高贵品质，也就不可能战胜统治阶级。”那么，作者的那种英雄形象的理想，即使只是从少数人身上发掘出来的，它们也同样具有深刻的典型意义，因为正是透过它们，尖锐地、突出地反映了中国农民传统的和现实的斗争精神的典型面貌。这正像毛主席从鲁迅身上看到的“骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜与媚骨”的“殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格”一样。从封建阶级的逆子贰臣、到主张个性解放的革命民主主义者，最后成为伟大的共产主义战士，这并不是每一个出身于封建阶级，受过资产阶级教育的老一代的知识分子共同走过的生活道路，即使走过来的，也不一定有表现在鲁迅身上的这样强烈，这样集中，这样尖锐的战斗性，所以即使是“少有的”，也并非不能成为典型，因为它是继承了传统而又显示了未来即将取得胜利的英雄人物。要知道典型并不等于统计的平均数，善于从普通人民身上，敏锐地把捉和发掘那闪耀着革命理想主义光芒的新品质，那怕只是萌芽而却具有新生的强大力量的，是革命作家的责任，也是革命文学有别于旧文学的最主要的特色。“红旗谱”的作者，正是由于从那个刚强老人身上激发起革命英雄主义的理想，才不断地发展和深化朱老忠的性格。因为最初的艺术处理只记述儿子们的英勇斗争的事迹，是不能回答他对老人的刚强性格的“久久不忘”的。而要发掘出这刚强老人潜在性格的生命力，就不能不去探索旧中国灾难深重但却不甘屈服的农民斗争，不能不去探索具体地形成老人性格的独特的生活经历，于是，在朱老忠的生活遭遇里，作者融合了幼年听到的朱老巩的大闹柳树林的故事，同时又在这血泊恨海的情节里，概括了河北、山东一带破产农民流浪关东（东北）的故事，这就使得这老人的刚强性格得到了完满的解答，而且在这样的“物质”基础上，也给这个英雄人物性格的丰富和发展，创造了一个历史和现实的广阔的精神境界，当然，在朱老忠的形象里的那些闪耀斗争光芒的品质，不一定是当时经历着时代风暴的所有老年农民都具有的，但是，集中在他身上的，却是中国农民最可宝贵的性格特色，正是因为这样，作者才能够把它和“红旗谱”的深刻的主题——世代农民的血仇和斗争，只有在共产党的领导下才能得到彻底的翻身和胜利——结合起来，完成了斗争和革命英雄谱系的真正的联接。在这样一个刻苦经营出来的典型性格里，自然无可怀疑的是融合着作家的革命的理想，只不过，这种革命的理想是建立在坚实、深厚的生活基础上。中国农民过去和现在的英勇斗争的历史，有权利向作家提出创造真实深刻的农民英雄典型的要求，新时代的作家也有义务满足这种要求，朱老忠的形象，只是对于这个历史任务的初步回答。
    我们的文学当然需要有高度真实地反映生活的现实主义，但那是革命的现实主义，而不是冒名为现实主义的爬行的自然主义，因为爬行的自然主义，是鼠目寸光地看待生活的，光辉灿烂的革命现实，在它那里是得不到真实的反映的。我们的文学当然需要革命的浪漫主义
  （或者叫做革命的理想主义），因为革命的现实，已经给作家插上了充分展开革命理想的翅膀，但是，革命的理想主义并不等于空洞的叫喊，更不等于庸俗的夸大，它必须有坚实、深厚的生活基础。现实和理想在艺术创造过程中的水乳交融，才是我们革命文学的真正的特色。在这个方面，“红旗谱”尤其是朱老忠的形象创造，是提供了值得参考的范例，也提供了值得参考的经验的。
