    Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd dispatch from Tokyo: 130,000 Korean residents in Japan held simultaneous rallies and demonstrations today in more than 40 cities and towns across Japan, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Japanese Red Cross immediately sign an agreement to repatriate Korean residents in Japan, so as to realize their desire to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as soon as possible.
    The central rally, organized by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), was held in Tokyo. More than 12,000 Korean residents hoping to return home, residing in Tokyo and major prefectures in the Kanto region, participated in the rally. Countless flags and banners of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fluttered at the venue. Slogans such as "Demand that Japan Immediately Sign the Repatriation Agreement" and "Realize Return to Homeland Immediately" resounded through the sky.
    Amid thunderous applause, the rally passed a resolution demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government stop conducting political transactions with the Syngman Rhee clique and, based on humanitarian principles, immediately take measures to allow Korean residents in Japan to return home.
    The resolution strongly condemned the Japanese side's behavior of attempting to resume the so-called "Japan-Rhee talks" while delaying the signing of the agreement.
    The rally also passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese Red Cross immediately sign the repatriation agreement and take concrete measures to enable Korean residents in Japan to return home as soon as possible.
    The resolution condemned the Japanese Red Cross's delay in signing the repatriation agreement as a violation of the spirit of the Red Cross and an act of succumbing to the political conspiracies of American imperialism, the Syngman Rhee clique, and Japanese reactionary forces.
    The rally also adopted a declaration, in which all participants firmly stated that in order to win the final victory, they would unite and launch a broader and more powerful movement. The General Association is scheduled to launch a larger-scale unified action on August 15th.
    After the rally, all participants marched to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Red Cross to hold a demonstration.
    More than 2,000 Korean residents residing in Shikoku and the Chugoku region held a rally in Hiroshima today, demanding that the Japanese side sign the already agreed-upon repatriation agreement.
    According to an announcement by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan today, from September of last year to July of this year, Korean residents in Japan have held 12,436 gatherings in various parts of Japan, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government fulfill its promise to allow Korean residents to return home, with a total of 1,560,000 participants.

    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：十三万旅日朝侨今天在日本四十多个都市和城镇同时举行大会和示威游行，要求岸信介政府和日本红十字会立即签署遣送旅日朝侨回国的协议，以便早日实现朝侨回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的愿望。

    大会在雷动般的掌声中通过决议，要求岸信介政府停止与李承晚集团进行政治交易，本着人道主义原则，立即采取措施让旅日朝侨回国。
    决议强烈谴责日方在拖延签署协议的同时，企图恢复所谓“日李会谈”的行为。
    大会还通过决议，要求日本红十字会立即签署遣侨协议，并且采取具体措施，以便使旅日朝侨早日回国。
