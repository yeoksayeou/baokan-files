Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: The Executive Committee for the National Movement to Realize the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations and Celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China was formally established in Tokyo today. Representatives from sixty-one parties and organizations participated in the Executive Committee.

    At today's inaugural meeting, the Executive Committee decided to designate September and October as a joint action month to launch various activities nationwide to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and celebrate China's National Day.

    The slogans for the joint action month are:

    1.  Enhance friendly relations between China and Japan and quickly restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.
    2.  Prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" because this treaty will make the work of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations more difficult.
    3.  Oppose policies hostile to China and seek to open up Sino-Japanese relations.
    4.  Celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China.

    The Executive Committee decided to hold a grand rally in Tokyo on October 1st to celebrate China's National Day. At the same time, it will submit a petition to the Japanese Diet's extraordinary session, demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations with China, requesting that local assemblies pass resolutions on restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and organizing relevant lectures and discussions.

    Today's meeting also adopted a letter to the Japanese people, calling on them to participate in various activities during the joint action month. The letter to the Japanese people said, "The Japanese people's celebration of China's National Day must be linked to their struggle to eliminate obstacles hindering Sino-Japanese friendly relations." The letter to the Japanese people said, "For Japan to develop peacefully, it must stop adopting a hostile attitude towards China, restore diplomatic relations with China, cooperate with Asian and African countries in accordance with the Bandung spirit, and stop participating in military alliances."

    Members of the Executive Committee include representatives from the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Communist Party, the Japan Peace Committee, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Farmers' Union, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Dipl

    今天的会议还通过了告日本人民书，号召他们参加共同行动月里的各项活动。告日本人民书说，“日本人民庆祝中国国庆必须同他们为消除阻挠日中友好关系的障碍而进行的斗争联系起来。”告日本人民书说，“日本要和平发展，就必须停止对中国采取敌视态度，同中国恢复外交关系，根据万隆精神同亚非国家合作，停止参加军事联盟。”
    实行委员会委员包括日本社会党、日本共产党、日本和平委员会、日本工会总评议会、全国农民联盟、日中友好协会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、日中文化交流协会和日本国际贸易促进协会等党派和团体的代表。
