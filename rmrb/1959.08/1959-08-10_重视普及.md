    Emphasize Popularization
    It is very important that science and technology associations in various parts of Shaanxi Province closely link with reality to popularize scientific and technological knowledge.

    The eagerness of the broad masses of workers and peasants in various places to participate in scientific and technological activities is precisely a manifestation of their desire to obtain scientific and technological knowledge. If science and technology associations can effectively impart scientific and technological knowledge to them, they can unleash their enthusiasm.

    By doing popularization work, we lay the foundation for improvement work. In their production practices, the broad masses of workers and peasants have created many experiences, often only knowing what happens, but not why it happens. If they increase their scientific and technological knowledge, they can use scientific methods to summarize their experiences and better guide production practices, creating more abundant harvest experiences. As the scientific and technological knowledge of the masses grows, scientific research activities can be better carried out, and there is hope for further achievements.

    Science and technology associations in other regions should also attach importance to the work of popularizing scientific and technological knowledge.

    重视普及
    陕西省各地科学技术协会紧密联系实际，普及科学技术知识，很重要。
    各地广大工人、农民乐于参加科学技术活动，正是他们渴望得到科学技术知识的表现。如果科学技术协会能切实地向他们传授科学技术知识，就可以发挥他们的积极性。
    做了普及的工作，提高工作也就有了基础。广大工农群众在生产实践中创造了许多经验，往往他们只知其然，不知其所以然。如果他们增长了科学技术知识，就可以用科学方法总结经验，更好地去指导生产实践，创造更多的丰产经验。群众的科学技术知识增长了，科学研究活动就可以更好地开展，有希望获得进一步的成就。
    其他各地的科学技术协会也应该把普及科学技术知识工作重视起来。
