Tangshan, This newspaper dispatch on August 10th: The workers of Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine, having established the idea of "advancing all work," have made their leadership work increasingly proactive, and the vast number of workers are striving for excellence, enabling the mine to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan every month. The daily output of raw coal and tunneling footage in July also reached the high production and high-speed levels required for August ahead of schedule.

The idea of "advancing all work" in Tangjiazhuang Mine is to tightly grasp the two basic links of coal mining and tunneling, and strive to complete all production tasks with stipulated targets ahead of schedule. The specific content includes: (1) Production plans are arranged early so that every worker has a clear understanding. The monthly production plan is proposed in the latter half of the previous month based on the production situation of the current month. When arranging the production tasks for the next month, it is required that the mid-month targets be achieved in the first ten days of the month, and the planned level for the last ten days be reached in the middle ten days. The guarantee plans of each team are also generally completed one or two days before the beginning of each month. (2) Production preparations are made in advance. Production preparation projects such as coal mining and tunneling are prepared in advance in the spirit of "looking at three months from one month, one year from one season, and three years from one year," combining the current with the long-term. (3) Ideological work takes precedence. Since the beginning of this year, the Party Committee of Tangjiazhuang Mine has organized twelve rounds of open discussions in response to different situations in different periods. At the beginning of this year, a few cadres had right-leaning conservative ideas and were willing to set lower targets when discussing the plan. The Party Committee criticized this idea in a timely manner and proposed advanced targets; it also conducted a series of education campaigns among the workers to encourage them to go all out and strive for excellence, thereby overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas and establishing the idea of exerting all efforts to strive for excellence. (4) Important projects related to coal production are completed as early as possible. For example, the second hydraulic coal mining, lifting, and transportation system, which was originally planned to be completed in July, was put into production in mid-March, increasing the daily coal output by more than 2,000 tons. In addition, for the work of departments, trade unions, health, sports, culture, and education that do not have plans or targets, emphasis is placed on focusing on production, improving the quality of work, and ensuring better service for production.

In order to realize "advancing all work," the mine leaders often gain an understanding of the specific situation of coal mining and tunneling work faces throughout the mine by going deep into key areas, collecting various materials, and participating in workers' meetings, and promptly dispatching resources. They also frequently start by analyzing the production situation and constantly look for the laws of coal mine production. At the beginning of this year, the leading cadres of the mine foresaw that an abnormal situation might occur in the early stages of the second hydraulic lifting system being put into production. In order to prevent it as early as possible, they prepared an extra mechanical coal mining "escort team." As a result, the production tasks were not affected because of early preparations.

Being good at analyzing the situation, proposing new tasks according to new circumstances, and using favorable conditions to overcome unfavorable conditions is an important condition for the mine to achieve "advancing all work." In March of this year, the Party Committee of Tangjiazhuang Mine firmly seized the favorable situation of the nationwide coal industry's large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition. Based on the fact that the daily coal production had exceeded 9,000 tons and had passed technical calculations, and that the tunneling footage was also close to 10,000 tons, it proposed to all workers the goal of "daily coal production of 10,000 tons, monthly tunneling of 10,000 meters." As a result, production was red every day in April, and these two targets were achieved. They are also good at using favorable conditions to overcome unfavorable factors. In the first half of the year, the mine once faced a situation of insufficient supply of materials and equipment, and the transportation equipment could not meet the needs of production. In order to change this situation, they used the advantageous conditions of having more experience in hydraulic coal mining, transportation, and lifting, and mobilized workers to use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, such as using ceramic chutes instead of steel chutes, to vigorously carry out "dry excavation" hydraulic transportation, which not only replaced many electric conveyors and mine cars, but also reduced labor intensity and improved efficiency, accelerating the tunneling progress.

When major problems that are difficult to predict in advance occur in production, the leading cadres at all levels of Tangjiazhuang Mine often adopt the method of "three combinations" to "diagnose" on the spot and "treat" on the spot, ensuring that each link in production follows one another forward. Under the guidance of the idea of advancing all work, coal mining, tunneling, transportation, and mechanical and electrical workers have successively studied technical innovations and learned advanced experiences. They have universally achieved "completing the shift's tasks within the shift, and not leaving difficulties for the next shift." Taking July as an example, most of the coal mining and tunneling work faces in the mine daily and evenly overfulfilled the coal mining or tunneling plan. All the workers in the mine, in the spirit of taking a cat as a tiger to fight against unsafe phenomena that hinder "advancing production tasks," made small accidents big rebellions, big accidents special rebellions, and strengthened equipment maintenance, so that work-related injuries and mechanical and electrical equipment accidents gradually decreased. The number of accidents related to work-related injuries, roof falls, blasting, mechanical and electrical equipment, and transportation decreased by 35% to 83% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The four major disasters of water, fire, wind, and dust, as well as serious accidents, were also eliminated.

Tangjiazhuang Mine is an old mine that has been exploited for many years. The wells are deep, the lanes are long, the water is abundant, and the coal seam conditions are poor. The production, transportation, and lifting capacity are extremely unbalanced. In recent years, there has often been a phenomenon of slackness at the beginning of the month, rush work at the end of the month, slackness in the first half of the year, and tightness in the second half of the year, making the work passive. In response to these situations, the Party Committee of Tangjiazhuang Mine, following the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, proposed the guiding ideology of "striving for excellence, striving for advancement, striving for first place, planting red flags, tenaciously overcoming difficulties, and advancing all work." For more than half a year, in order to make this guiding ideology take root among the masses, Party organizations at all levels have frequently struggled against the right-leaning conservative, lax, and complacent sentiments of a few cadres. In June, based on the national situation and the mine's production situation, the mine's Party Committee took the initiative to raise the annual state plan by 50,000 tons, guiding all workers to continuously move forward.

Since the mine implemented the guiding ideology of "advancing all work," profound changes have taken place in all aspects of the work. Production is more rhythmic, and leading cadres are no longer as busy, chaotic, and passive as before, staying up late with red eyes. Now, they can have more time to consider some major issues and can adhere to normal theoretical study. The vast number of workers also have a balance of work and rest. Workers can often participate in cultural and technical studies. Cultural, recreational, and sports activities are also active. In the first half of the year, the mine's workers created more than 48,000 literary and artistic works, performed more than 800 dramas and films, with an audience of more than 467,000 people. The workers' rest time has also been fully guaranteed.

    赶前不赶后　时时争上游
　　唐家庄煤矿月月全面超额完成计划
    本报唐山10日电　开滦唐家庄煤矿职工，树立了“一切工作往前赶”的思想，领导工作日益主动，广大职工力争上游，全矿月月全面超额完成了国家计划。7月份的原煤日产量和掘进进尺也提前达到8月份要求的高产和高速水平。
    唐家庄矿“一切工作往前赶”的思想，就是紧紧抓住采煤和掘进这两个基本环节，凡有指标规定的生产任务，都力争提前完成。具体内容包括：（一）生产计划及早安排，使职工人人心中有数。每个月的生产计划，都在上月的下旬，根据当月的生产情况提出来，而在安排下个月的生产任务时，要求上旬实现中旬指标，中旬达到下旬的计划水平。各小组的保证计划，每月也在一、二日前普遍订完。（二）提前做好生产准备。采煤掘进等生产准备工程都本着“一月看三月，一季看一年，一年看三年”，当前与长远结合的精神，提前准备出来。（三）思想工作先行。今年以来，中共唐家庄矿委员会，针对不同时期的不同形势，先后组织了十二次鸣放辩论。在今年年初，少数干部有右倾保守思想，讨论计划时愿意把指标订得低一些。党委会及时批判了这种思想，并提出了先进指标；又在职工群众中进行了一系列的鼓足干劲的教育，从而克服了右倾保守思想，树立了鼓足干劲力争上游的思想。（四）有关煤炭生产的重要工程尽量提前完成。例如原来计划在7月建成的第二个水力采煤、提升、运输系统，在3月中旬就提前投入了生产，每天的煤产量就增加了两千多吨。此外，对于没有计划、指标的科室工作、工会工作、卫生、体育、文教等项工作，则强调围绕生产，提高工作质量，保证更好地为生产服务。
    为了实现“一切工作往前赶”，这个矿的领导上，经常通过深入重点，搜集各种资料，参加工人的会议等活动，了解全矿的采煤和掘进工作面的具体情况，及时进行调度。他们还经常从分析生产情况着手，不断地寻找煤矿生产的规律。今年初，这个矿的领导干部预见到在第二个水力提升系统投入生产的初期，生产可能出现不正常的局面，为了及早预防，他们准备了一个计划外的机械采煤“保驾掌”。结果，由于早有准备，生产任务并没有受到影响。
    善于分析形势，根据新的情况提出新的任务，利用有利条件克服不利条件，是这个矿实现“一切工作往前赶”的一个重要条件。今年3月，唐家庄矿党委紧紧抓住全国煤炭工业掀起的大面积丰产红旗竞赛的有利形势，根据当时每天的产煤量已超过了九千多吨，已经过了技术测算，查明掘进进尺也接近万吨，于是就向全矿职工提出“日产煤万吨，月掘进万米”的奋斗方向，结果4月份生产日日红，实现了这两个指标。他们还善于利用有利条件来克服不利因素。上半年内，这个矿一度出现了材料、设备供应不足的局面，运输设备满足不了生产需要。为了改变这个局面，他们运用水力采煤、运输、提升较有经验的有利条件，发动职工用土洋结合的办法，用陶瓷溜槽代替钢板溜槽等措施，大搞“旱掘”水力运输，不仅代替了很多电台溜子和矿车，并且减轻了劳动强度，提高了效率，加快了掘进进度。
    当生产中出现事先很难预料的重大问题的时候，唐家庄矿的各级领导干部经常采用“三结合”的方法，到现场“会诊”，就地“医疗”保证了生产中的各个环节一环跟着一环地往前赶。采煤、掘进、运输和机电工人们，在一切工作往前赶的思想指导下，纷纷研究技术革新，学习先进经验，你追我赶、普遍做到了“当班任务当班完，不给下班留困难”。以7月为例，全矿大多数的采煤和掘进工作面，天天均衡地超额完成采煤或掘进计划。全矿职工对那些妨碍“生产任务往前赶”的不安全现象，都以拿猫当虎斗的精神，小事故大反，大事故特反以及加强设备维修等活动，使工伤和机电设备事故逐渐减少。工伤、顶板、放炮、机电、运输等项事故，第二季度比第一季度减少了35％到83％。还消灭了水、火、风、尘四大灾害和恶性事故。
    唐家庄矿是一个开采多年的老矿。井深、巷远、水大、煤原条件又不好，生产和运输、提升能力极不平衡。近几年来，常常出现月初松，月末突击，上半年松，下半年紧的现象，工作被动。中共唐家庄矿委员会针对这些情况，遵循党的八届六中全会精神，提出了“争上游，争先进，争第一，插红旗，顽强克服困难，一切工作往前赶”的指导思想。半年多来，为了使这个指导思想在群众中生根，各级党组织经常和少数干部的右倾保守松劲自满情绪进行斗争。6月间，矿党委根据全国形势和全矿生产情况，主动把全年国家计划提高了五万吨，引导全体职工不断前进。
    这个矿自从贯彻了“一切工作往前赶”的指导思想以来，各方面的工作已经发生了深远的影响。生产较有节奏，领导干部不再像以前那样忙乱被动，熬得两眼通红了。现在，他们能有比较宽裕的时间考虑一些重大问题，和能够坚持正常的理论学习。广大职工也是有劳有逸。工人们都能经常参加文化和技术学习。文化娱乐和体育活动也活跃起来。上半年内，全矿职工创作的文娱作品就有四万八千多件，演出了戏剧，电影八百多场，观众达到四十六万七千多人次。职工们的休息时间也得到了充分的保证。
