    Today's Kaesong and Panmunjom
    By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    I recently visited Kaesong and Panmunjom. This is where the Korean War began and ended. Nine years ago, on June 25, the US-Syngman Rhee troops fired the first shot across the 38th parallel from cannons placed next to Kaesong's South Gate, igniting the Korean War. And six years ago, on July 27, the battered and bruised US imperialists were forced to sign the armistice agreement at Panmunjom, 15 kilometers east of Kaesong, after being defeated by the Korean and Chinese People's armies. Kaesong and Panmunjom are among the most thought-provoking places for our generation; they are the most powerful witnesses to peace's victory over war.

          The Rebirth of an Ancient City
    I arrived at Kaesong's South Gate. Atop this ancient granite gate stands a rebuilt gate tower (the original was destroyed in the war), with its upturned eaves and brackets. The vermilion beams and pillars are painted with colorful ethnic patterns and designs, looking so solemn and beautiful in the sunlight. In the open space before and behind the South Gate (perhaps where Syngman Rhee's puppet army set up their cannons), clusters of flowers bloom vividly in newly built flower beds.
    Kaesong, liberated from Syngman Rhee's dark rule nine years ago, returned to the warm embrace of the Republic, beginning a new chapter in its thousand-year history. The South Gate is a symbol of this ancient city's rebirth.
    Ascending the South Gate's tower, I saw peaceful construction taking place everywhere in Kaesong. 60% of Kaesong's buildings were destroyed by American bombing during the war, but today it has been rebuilt even more beautifully than before. Around the South Gate, cranes with their giant arms stand tall, and newly built three- and four-story buildings are neatly arranged one after another. To the west of the South Gate, a wide square has been newly opened, which is the center of the new Kaesong.
    To the north of the square is the newly built Songdo Political and Economic University building, and a long row of dormitory buildings is under construction to the south. In the six years since the war, Kaesong has newly built twenty-two schools and housing for 6,000 families with state investment alone.
    On the former site of Syngman Rhee's juvenile prison, a large area of white factory buildings has emerged. This is the newly built Kaesong Textile Factory. More than 6,000 workers here produce fabrics and clothing with novel designs. This factory can produce more than 20 million meters of cloth this year, while during Syngman Rhee's rule, the entire Kaesong could only produce 280,000 meters.
    In the six years since the war, Kaesong has restored and newly built 55 factories (51 of which are newly built), including textile factories, rubber factories, ceramic factories, and machinery factories. Last year, the total industrial output value reached 76 times that of 1953. Now, workers account for 25,000 of Kaesong's population of 70,000. In just a few years, Kaesong has transformed from a consuming commercial city into a producing light industrial city.
    Kaesong is the world-renowned hometown of Goryeo ginseng. All around the suburbs of Kaesong, you can see ginseng fields. The cultivation area of ginseng is now about twice that before liberation, and it will be greatly developed in the future. Now the ginseng here is sold all over the world.

        The Wishes of the People of Kaesong
    The people of Kaesong today are very happy, but also very sad.
    They are happy because, with the care of the Republic government since liberation, their lives are getting better day by day. Kaesong has now fundamentally eliminated the serious unemployment that existed during Syngman Rhee's rule, and workers' wages have increased several times. In the past, more than half of the school-age children in Kaesong were out of school, but now they are all enrolled for free and have implemented compulsory junior high school education.
    They are sad because, due to the US imperialists occupying South Korea, many families, like their motherland, are divided in two and cannot be reunited.
    I visited Kim Chun-in, a 42-year-old female worker at the Kaesong Textile Factory. Her husband was abducted to South Korea by the US-Syngman Rhee army when they fled Kaesong nine years ago. The youngest son she was carrying in her womb at that time is now nine years old, but the wife still cannot see her husband, and the father cannot come home to see his five children. Their pain cannot be described in words. Kim Chun-in said with grief and indignation: The armistice has been in place for six years. Why do the US imperialists occupy South Korea and refuse to leave? Why do they obstruct the peaceful reunification of our country and prevent our family from reuniting?
    In Kaesong, which street, which lane does not have people like Kim Chun-in? Their most urgent wish is peaceful reunification.
    The people of Kaesong have transformed their hatred for the US military and their desire for peaceful reunification into strength, and are accelerating socialist construction. At the end of last year, the 25,000 workers in Kaesong completed the industrial output value plan of the first five-year plan three years ahead of schedule. Last year, at the Kaesong Textile Factory where Kim Chun-in works, the workers proposed a production increase target of one million meters of cloth. The Syngman Rhee clique's radio station in Seoul slandered them, saying that they were being "forced to labor" and would definitely not be able to complete this production increase plan. Kim Chun-in and her companions worked hard throughout the year, and as a result, they slapped the Syngman Rhee clique in the face with a production increase of 1.3 million meters of cloth. They are using their own strength to realize their wishes.

          What I Saw at Panmunjom
    North and South Korea, separated by a military demarcation line, are preparing to rekindle the war on one side and carrying out peaceful construction on the other; one side is darkness and the other side is light. Anyone who has been to Panmunjom today can clearly see this.
    From Kaesong to Panmunjom, the roadsides are full of green rice paddies. This year, the farmers here have promoted the deep plowing, dense planting, and heavy fertilization methods proposed by the Labor Party, and the rice is growing particularly well. The endless green rice fields stretch into the demilitarized zone, the northern edge of the military demarcation line. But when you climb the hill in the Panmunjom conference area and look south, the situation south of the military demarcation line is completely different: that side is overgrown with weeds, crisscrossed with barbed wire. Some of the farmers who originally lived in the demilitarized zone have been driven away, because the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are afraid that they will see the prosperity of the north. Now, only US military police and US agents haunt those weedy areas.
    At Panmunjom, the signing hall where the armistice agreement was signed that year has been properly preserved as a historical site. In the magnificent and spacious hall, many pictures are displayed, and domestic and foreign guests often come here to visit. At Panmunjom, there is also the meeting room of the Military Armistice Commission. After the armistice, in order to aggravate the tension in Korea and hinder the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the US side not only did not withdraw its troops, but also violated the armistice agreement by transporting atomic cannons and missiles into South Korea, turning South Korea into a base for atomic warfare. In the six years since the armistice, the crimes of the US side are countless, and the representatives of the US side have also exhausted their shameless, lying, denying, fabricated, and turning black into white rogue tactics in this conference room.
    On June 10 this year, I went to Panmunjom to cover the meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held that day. At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, questioned Mr. Bidu, the chief representative of the US side, as to why the US side violated the armistice agreement by transporting atomic and missile weapons into South Korea. Under this righteous accusation, Bidu sat there blankly, repeating the absurd arguments that his predecessors had said years ago like a gramophone, saying that the import of missiles was to "maintain military balance" and that the US military did not leave was "for defense." Major General Zhu Changjun asked him, when the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reduced its troops by 80,000, you expanded the Rhee puppet army from 16 divisions to 31 divisions, and when the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew completely, you expanded the military force in South Korea. Is this to maintain "balance"? The embarrassed Bidu had beads of sweat on his forehead.
    Today, all the Korean people are shouting, "US troops get out of South Korea!" The US military, which is lingering in South Korea, is becoming more and more embarrassed and isolated day by day, and will eventually be driven out by the Korean people. (Attached picture)

### 今日的开城和板门店

    今日的开城和板门店
    本报记者　王玉章
    记者最近访问了开城和板门店。这里是朝鲜战争的起点，也是朝鲜战争的终点。九年前的6月25日，美李军队架在开城市南大门旁边的大炮向三八线以北开了第一炮，挑起了朝鲜战争。而在六年前的7月27日，被朝中人民军队打得头破血流的美帝国主义又被迫在开城以东十五公里的板门店在停战协定上签了字。开城和板门店是在我们这一代人中最发人深思的地方之一，它们是和平战胜战争最有力的见证人。
          古城的新生
    我来到开城的南大门前。这座花岗岩筑成的古老的城门上面，高耸着重新建设起来的门楼（原来的在战争中被毁了），飞檐、斗拱，朱红的梁柱上绘着彩色的民族图案和花纹，在阳光的照射下是那么庄严美丽。南大门前后的空地上（也许就是当年李承晚伪军架大炮的地方吧）新辟的花坛中，一簇簇花朵开的十分鲜艳。
    开城九年前从李承晚的黑暗统治下解放出来，回到共和国温暖的怀抱，开始了它一千多年历史上的新的一页，南大门就是这座古城新生的象征。
    登上南大门的城楼眺望，看见开城到处进行着和平建设。战争时期开城市的建筑物被美军炸毁了60％，可是今天已经建设得比过去更美丽了。南大门的四周兀立着一架架高扬着巨臂的起重机，新建的三层和四层楼房，一幢接一幢整齐地排列着。南大门的西面新辟了一个宽阔的广场，这是新的开城市的中心。
    广场北面是新建的松都政治经济大学校舍，南面一长排宿舍大楼正在兴建。战后六年来，开城市仅国家投资就新建了二十二所学校和能住六千户居民的住宅。
    在原来李承晚的少年监狱的旧址上，出现了一大片白色的厂房，这是战后新建的开城织物工厂，六千多名工人在这里生产着花色新颖的布匹和衣料，这个厂今年能生产二千多万公尺布，而李承晚统治时期整个开城市只能生产二十八万公尺。
    战后六年来，开城市共恢复和新建了织物厂、橡胶厂、陶瓷厂、机械厂等五十五座工厂（其中有五十一座是新建的），去年的工业总产值达到1953年的七十六倍。现在开城市的七万人口中，工人占了二万五千名。开城市在短短的几年内，已由一个消费的商业城市改造成为生产的轻工业城市了。
    开城是世界闻名的高丽参的故乡。在开城市郊到处可以看见一片片人参圃，现在人参的栽培面积比解放前增加了约一倍，将来还要大大的发展。现在这里的人参远销到世界各地。
        开城人的愿望
    今天的开城人民是很幸福的，同时又是很痛苦的。
    幸福的是解放后在共和国政府的关怀下生活一天比一天好。现在开城市已根本消灭了李承晚统治时期的严重失业现象，工人的工资比那时增加了好几倍。过去开城市的学龄儿童有一半以上失学，现在早已全部免费入学，并且实行了中学义务教育制。
    痛苦的是由于美帝国主义侵占着南朝鲜，多少个家庭像他们的祖国一样被分为两半，不能团圆。
    记者访问了开城织物工厂四十二岁的女工金春仁，她的丈夫在九年前美李军队从开城逃走的时候被劫到南朝鲜去了，那时她怀在肚子里的最小的儿子现在已经九岁了，但至今妻子不能见到丈夫，父亲不能回家看望自己的五个孩子。他们的痛苦不是用语言能够形容的。金春仁悲愤地说：停战六年了，美帝国主义为什么霸占着南朝鲜不走，为什么阻挠我们祖国的和平统一，不让我们一家团聚？
    在开城市，哪一条街、哪一条巷没有金春仁这样的人，他们的最迫切的愿望就是和平统一。
    开城人民把对美军的仇恨和对和平统一的渴望化成了力量，加紧进行社会主义建设。在去年年底，开城市的二万五千工人就提前三年完成了第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划。去年，在金春仁所在的开城织物工厂，工人们提出了增产一百万公尺布的增产目标。李承晚集团在汉城的广播电台污蔑他们是被“强迫劳动”，一定完不成这个增产计划。金春仁同她的同伴们去年一年努力生产，结果以增产一百三十万公尺布的成绩给了李承晚集团一个响亮的耳光。他们在用自己的力量来实现自己的愿望。
          板门店所见
    被一条军事分界线分开的南北朝鲜，一边在准备重新挑起战争，一边在进行和平建设；一边是黑暗，一边是光明。到过今天的板门店的人就清清楚楚地看到这一点。
    从开城到板门店，公路两旁全是一片绿油油的水稻。今年，这里的农民推广了劳动党提出的深耕、密植、多施肥的耕作法，水稻长得特别好。一眼望不到边的绿油油的水稻一直延伸到非军事区内，军事分界线的北缘。可是登上板门店会场区内的山岗向南望，军事分界线以南完全是另一种光景：那边杂草丛生，铁丝网纵横，原来住在非军事区内的一些农民都被赶走了，因为美国和李承晚集团怕他们看见北边的繁荣景象。现在，只有美国宪兵和美国特务在那些荒草丛中出没。
    在板门店，当年签订停战协定的签字大厅，已被当作历史遗迹妥善保存下来了。在雄伟宽敞的大厅里，陈列着许多图片，经常有朝鲜国内外的客人来这里参观。在板门店，还有军事停战委员会的会议室。停战以后，美方为了加剧朝鲜的紧张局势，妨碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，不仅不把军队撤走，反而破坏停战协定，把原子大炮和导弹运入南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成原子战争的基地。停战六年来，美方的罪行真是数不胜数，而美方的代表也在这个会议室里耍尽了厚颜无耻、撒谎抵赖、无中生有、指白说黑的流氓手段。
    今年6月10日，记者曾到板门店采访军事停战委员会在当天举行的会议。朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上责问美方首席委员比杜，为什么美方违反停战协定把原子和导弹武器运入南朝鲜。比杜在这种义正词严的指责下，木然地坐在那里，像留声机一样重复着他的前任几年前就说过的荒谬的论调，说运进导弹是为了“保持军力均衡”，美军不走是“为了防御”。朱昌骏少将问他，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府裁军八万人的时候，你们却把李伪军从十六个师扩大到三十一个师，在中国人民志愿军全部撤走的时候，你们却扩大在南朝鲜的军事力量，难道这就是为了保持“均衡”吗？狼狈不堪的比杜额角上沁出了一颗颗的汗珠。
    今天，全朝鲜人民都在高呼“美军从南朝鲜滚出去！”赖在南朝鲜不走的美军，一天比一天狼狈，一天比一天孤立，终会有一天被朝鲜人民赶走的。（附图片）
