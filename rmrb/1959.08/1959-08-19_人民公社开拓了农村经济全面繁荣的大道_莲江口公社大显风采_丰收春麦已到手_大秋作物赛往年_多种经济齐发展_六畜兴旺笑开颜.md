(Our Harbin, August 18th dispatch) In the season of wheat harvest in Heilongjiang Province, the Lianjiangkou People's Commune in Tangyuan County, established less than a year ago, is displaying a beautiful picture of prosperous development of a diversified economy with agriculture as the mainstay, from which one can see the great superiority of the People's Commune.

This year, the commune's 20,000 mu of spring wheat has already been harvested, with an average yield per mu increasing by 26% compared to last year's bumper harvest. The 130,000 mu of various major autumn crops are growing better than in any previous year. With more than forty days until the autumn harvest, the commune's farm tool repair shop has already manufactured more than 9,000 sickles ahead of schedule. In the commune's and management district's livestock farms, cattle and sheep are in herds, pigs fill the pens, chickens and ducks form lines, and eggs fill the baskets, presenting another scene of prosperity.

The Lianjiangkou Commune was established on the basis of twenty-two advanced agricultural cooperatives. This new type of organization, the People's Commune, facilitates the unified and centralized allocation of labor on a larger scale for basic farmland construction. After the commune was established last autumn, it concentrated thousands of laborers to carry out autumn plowing and water conservancy construction. Farmers used shovels, hoes, new-style animal-powered farm tools, and tractors to thoroughly turn over the shallow-plowed land that had only been tilled in a small furrow on the ridge for hundreds of years, deep-plowing it to a depth of eight inches to one foot. This year, 60% of the commune's crops are planted on the autumn-plowed land. At the same time, the commune completed a 25-li long water conservancy trunk line, forming a large irrigation area capable of irrigating 15,000 mu of farmland. This water conservancy trunk line benefits seven management districts. In the past, farmers had longed for it for many years, but because the scale of the advanced cooperative was small and the scope of production was limited, they could not spare the manpower to build it; only after communization was their wish realized. In this large irrigation area, 6,000 mu of rice were planted this year. The commune also adopted the practice of unified planning of economic zoning, changing the situation in the advanced cooperatives where, due to the small scale of the cooperative, it was not possible to fully plant crops suitable for the area. For example, the Linjiang, Yongchang, and Changsheng management districts along the Songhua River have soil and climate suitable for planting spring wheat, so the commune planned for these management districts to plant more spring wheat, with the wheat area in Changsheng management district alone doubling.

Because the commune has more people and strength, farmers have been able to put comprehensive effort into the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture over the past year. In addition to deep plowing and water conservancy construction, 70% of the commune's land has been fertilized, changing the local habit of not fertilizing or fertilizing little in the past; spring wheat was rationally and densely planted, increasing from 2 million plants per hectare to 4.5 million to 5.5 million plants; and improved varieties were selected for all spring wheat and soybeans. As a result, various crops in spring and autumn this year are growing particularly lush compared to previous years.

People's communes have opened up a broad road for the development of a diversified economy. At present, the Lianjiangkou Commune is making unified plans for the commune's labor force based on the progress of agricultural affairs, labor conditions, and natural conditions in each management district. During the "hanging up the hoe" period, the commune is not only focusing on the late-stage field management of major autumn crops but also carrying out a "shock month" for diversified operations. All 6,100 laborers in the commune are participating in production activities in a planned way. One-quarter of the labor force is in the fields loosening the soil, weeding, and promoting the early maturity of soybeans, corn, and rice, and is also accumulating large amounts of fertilizer in the fields, aiming to accumulate enough fertilizer for 70% of the planting area for next year before the autumn harvest. Nearly a thousand laborers are digging ditches and building reservoirs at the water conservancy construction sites that were not completed last year. Nearly one-third of the manpower is invested in the "shock month" of diversified operations, engaging in sideline production such as cutting sheep grass, weaving, transportation, raising pigs, raising fish, and collecting medicinal materials. Cutting sheep grass is the main sideline occupation in the area, which was previously carried out by advanced cooperatives in a decentralized manner, which was not only inefficient but also damaged the grasslands due to unplanned production. This year, the commune has uniformly dispatched 400 people from each management district to concentrate on cutting sheep grass, which is highly efficient. From the beginning of August to August 10th, more than 400,000 bundles of grass were cut in the Dongquan River meadow, which is estimated to be worth more than 36,000 yuan. Before the autumn harvest, the commune plans to earn 610,000 yuan from diversified operations, with an average income of 126 yuan per household. In the activities of vigorously developing diversified operations, the Lianjiangkou Commune uses its strong public economy to guide and support the management districts and members' families in developing sideline production. The commune has already established farm tool repair shops, brick factories, and pig and chicken farms. In addition to meeting market needs, these sideline production projects also supply piglets and chicks to the pig and chicken farms in various management districts, as well as to members' families for breeding. At present, the total number of live pigs in the commune has reached 5,100, an average of one per household, an increase of 60% compared to last year. Several management districts did not raise pigs during the advanced cooperative period, but they also raised pigs after communization. The commune has 48,000 chickens, an increase of two times compared to last year.

The establishment of people's communes has played a particularly significant role in changing the face of weak management districts. Among the commune's twenty-two management districts, six management districts have been relatively slow in developing production due to insufficient manpower, poor natural conditions, and weak leadership in the advanced cooperative period. For example, the Sihe Management District could not catch up with the season every year when sowing, so the yield of crops was not high. Other advanced cooperatives produced 6,000 to 10,000 jin of rice per hectare, but the Sihe Management District only harvested 1,200 jin. The commune adopted the method of helping politically and supporting economically these weak management districts, and successively sent thirteen cadres to enrich the grassroots leadership, lent seeds, food, etc., worth more than 80,000 yuan, and allocated five diesel engines to help them irrigate, cut grass, and mill rice. Under the leadership and assistance of the commune, the production of these weak management districts is catching up. The growth of rice in the Sihe Management District is no worse than that of the advanced management districts. (Attached picture)

In Huaibei, Anhui, a basic river network has been realized, and the newly dug rivers have played a role in water storage and irrigation in drought resistance. The picture shows commune members of the Danqiao Commune in Linquan County using waterwheels to irrigate.

　　人民公社开拓了农村经济全面繁荣的大道
　　莲江口公社大显风采
　　丰收春麦已到手　大秋作物赛往年　多种经济齐发展　六畜兴旺笑开颜
    本报哈尔滨18日电　在黑龙江省小麦丰收的季节里，成立还不到一年的汤原县莲江口人民公社，展示了一幅以农业为主、多种经济繁荣发展的美丽画图，从这里可以看到人民公社的巨大优越性。
    今年，这个公社的两万亩春小麦已经收获到手，比大丰收的去年平均亩产增加26％。十三万亩各种大秋作物生长得比任何一年都好。现在离秋收还有四十多天，公社的农具修配厂，已经提早制造出九千多把镰刀。在公社和管理区的畜牧场里，牛羊成群猪满圈，鸡鸭结队蛋满筐，又是一片兴旺气象。
    莲江口公社是在二十二个高级农业社的基础上建立起来的。人民公社这种新型的组织，便于在较大范围内统一集中调配劳动力进行农田基本建设。公社在去年秋天成立以后，就集中了数千名劳动力，进行秋翻和兴修水利。农民们用锹镐、新式畜力农具、拖拉机，把数百年来仅在垅台上翻耕一条小沟的浅耕地，彻底翻转过来，深翻了八寸到一尺。今年全公社60％的农作物就种在秋翻过的耕地上。同时，公社修成了一条长达二十五里的水利干线，形成了一个能灌溉一万五千亩耕地的大灌区。这条水利干线，由七个管理区共同受益。过去，农民们向往了好几年，但是因为高级社的规模小、生产范围单一，不能抽出人力来兴修；只有在公社化后，他们的愿望才实现。在这个大灌区，今年播种了六千亩水稻。公社还采取了统一规划经济区划的作法，改变了在高级社的时候，因为社规模小，不能充分地种植适合本地区的作物的情况。比如沿松花江的临江、永昌、长胜等管理区，土壤和气候都适合种春小麦，公社就规划这些管理区多种春小麦，仅长胜管理区小麦面积就扩大一倍。
    由于公社人多力大，一年来，农民们才有可能在农业八字宪法上全面下功夫。除了深翻、修水利之外，全社70％的土地增施了肥料，改变了当地过去不施肥或少施肥的习惯；小麦实行合理密植，每公顷由过去的二百万株增加到四百五十万株至五百五十万株；小麦和大豆全部都选用了良种。结果，今年春秋各种庄稼比往年长得特别茂盛。
    人民公社为多种经济的发展，打开了一条大路。目前，莲江口公社根据各管理区农事的进展程度、劳动力状况和自然条件，对全公社的劳动力进行了统一筹划。“挂锄”期间，公社一面狠抓大秋作物后期田间管理，一面开展多种经营的突击月。全公社的六千一百名劳动力，都在有计划地参加生产活动。有四分之一的劳动力，正在田间为大豆、苞米和水稻放秋垅、拔大草，促进庄稼早熟，并且在田间大量积肥，要在秋收以前的四十天中，积出够明年播种面积70％的肥料。近千名劳动力，在去年未完成的水利工地上，挖渠、修水库。近三分之一的人力投入多种经营突击月里，大搞打羊草、编织、运输、养猪、养鱼、采药材等副业生产。打羊草是当地的主要副业，过去由高级社分散进行，不但效率低，而且由于生产无计划，给草场带来了损害。今年公社统一由各管理区抽调出四百人集中打羊草，打草效率高，从8月初开始到8月10日止，就在东圈河草甸子打草四十多万捆，估计可卖三万六千多元。在秋收以前，公社计划在多种经营上收入六十一万元，每个农户平均可以收入一百二十六元。在大搞多种经营的活动中，莲江口公社以它的强大的公有经济，指导和扶助管理区和社员家庭开展副业生产。公社已经办起了农具修配厂、红砖厂、养猪养鸡场。这些副业生产项目，除了供应市场需要外，还把猪仔、鸡雏供应各管理区的养猪场和养鸡场，以及社员家庭饲养。现在，全公社的生猪达到五千一百头，平均每户一头，比去年增加60％。有几个管理区在高级社时期不喂猪，公社化后也喂了猪。全社有鸡四万八千只，比去年增加二倍。
    人民公社的成立，特别对改变薄弱管理区面貌，起了显著的作用。公社的二十二个管理区中，有六个管理区由于在高级社的时候，受到人力不足、自然条件差以及领导力量薄弱的限制，生产的发展比较迟缓。像四合管理区每年下种赶不上季节，因而农作物产量不高。别的高级社水稻每公顷产六千斤到一万斤，可是四合管理区只收了一千二百斤。公社对这些薄弱管理区采取了在政治上帮助和经济上扶持的办法，先后派出十三名干部充实基层领导，贷给了种籽、食粮等，共值八万多元，拨给了五台柴油机，帮助他们灌溉、打草、碾米。在公社领导和帮助下，这几个薄弱管理区的生产正在迎头赶上。四合管理区水稻的生长情况，就完全不比先进的管理区差。（附图片）
