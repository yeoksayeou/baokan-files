Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 11th. In a conversation with the chief editors of the Bulgarian newspapers "Workers' Cause" and "Agricultural Banner," Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu said that the Albanian government believes that the most urgent and important task for all countries in the Balkans and Adriatic region is to work together to eliminate the threat of atomic war.

The Albanian newspapers published Shehu's conversation on the 11th.

Shehu said that we fully agree with Khrushchev's proposal to establish a region of peace free of atomic and nuclear weapons in the Balkans and the Adriatic Sea, and express our readiness to negotiate on this issue. We welcome and unreservedly support the Romanian government's proposal to convene a meeting of heads of government of Balkan countries, and support the Bulgarian government's proposal that Bulgaria and Greece conclude a treaty of non-aggression.

Shehu pointed out that the Albanian government has continuously strived and taken concrete steps to normalize Albania's relations with Italy and Greece. He said that the Albanian government had long expressed its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with Greece. However, regrettably, the Greek government has not shown the same desire. On the contrary, it has created provocative incidents on the border, killing Albanian soldiers. At the same time, Greece's reactionary chauvinist groups have launched an absurd movement to restore territory, falsely claiming that southern Albania was once Greek territory. This insane demand is purely provocative, aimed at inciting chauvinist sentiments and artificially creating tension in Albanian-Greek relations.

Speaking about Albanian-Bulgarian relations, Shehu said that we will safeguard and further strengthen the friendship between our two countries and solidarity with other socialist countries, and defeat the divisive activities of imperialists and reactionary groups, as well as the modern revisionists, the servants of imperialism.

　　谢胡表示支持苏罗保三国建议
　　巴尔干应当成为和平地区
　　决定努力改善同意希两国的关系
    新华社地拉那11日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡对保加利亚“工人事业报”和“农业旗帜报”的主编发表谈话时说，阿尔巴尼亚政府认为，目前巴尔干和亚得里亚地区各国最迫切的重要任务是，共同努力消除原子战争威胁。
    阿尔巴尼亚的报纸11日刊载了谢胡的这篇谈话。
    谢胡说，我们完全同意赫鲁晓夫关于在巴尔干和亚得里亚海建立无原子武器和核武器的和平地区的建议，并表示准备就此问题进行谈判。我们欢迎并毫无保留地支持罗马尼亚政府关于召开巴尔干国家政府首脑会议的建议，支持保加利亚政府关于保加利亚和希腊缔结互不侵犯条约的建议。
    谢胡指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府不断努力和采取具体步骤，以便使阿尔巴尼亚同意大利和希腊的关系正常化。他说，阿尔巴尼亚政府早已表示过愿同希腊建立外交关系。但是，遗憾的是，希腊政府没有表现同样的愿望。相反，它在边境制造挑衅事件，打死阿尔巴尼亚的士兵。同时，希腊的反动的沙文主义集团展开了荒谬的恢复领土的运动，胡说什么阿尔巴尼亚南部曾是希腊的领土。这种疯狂的要求纯属挑衅性质，目的在于挑起沙文主义情绪，并人为地在阿希关系中制造紧张局势。
    谢胡在谈到阿保两国的关系时说，我们将维护和进一步加强我们两国之间的友谊以及同其他社会主义国家的团结，击败帝国主义者和反动集团以及帝国主义的奴仆现代修正主义者的分裂活动。
