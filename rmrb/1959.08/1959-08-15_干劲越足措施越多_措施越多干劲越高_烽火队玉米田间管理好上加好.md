Xi'an, August 11th: The famous young peasant researcher and corn high-yield model—Wang Baojing, the head of the Fenghuo Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, and the Fenghuo production team he leads, use advanced thinking to guide the continuous advancement of the corn high-yield movement, enabling the masses' labor enthusiasm to increase step by step, and the measures to increase production to deepen stage by stage.

This year, the Fenghuo production team planted a total of 550 mu of replanted corn, which is the team's main autumn grain crop. The most important problem in the corn high-yield movement is that the enthusiasm of some cadres is sometimes hot and sometimes cold, which affects the high-yield movement, which is also tight for a while and loose for a while. Therefore, the various measures are not thoroughly implemented or timely, and the corn grows unevenly, affecting the completion of the high-yield plan. Some people also believe that there is already a set of experience in planting corn, and high yields can be achieved without formulating measures. Some people also think that they should take a break after the summer planting. Wang Baojing and other comrades adhered to the correct attitude, educated the people who had this kind of thinking, explained the harm of slack thinking, and educated everyone with the examples of the team's increasing production year by year, stating that they must not stand still and must strive for new victories on the basis of victory.

In order to make the high-yield movement deepen step by step, Wang Baojing proposed to continuously check, evaluate, classify, and rank in the high-yield movement, and to continuously formulate measures to guide production. The specific method is to divide the growth process of corn into five stages according to the seedling, jointing, tasseling, flowering and pollination, irrigation, and maturity stages. Each stage should be checked, evaluated, classified, and ranked, and management measures should be formulated according to the growth of corn in each stage, so that the cornfield management work can be refined and improved. The first inspection and evaluation started on July 5th. The inspection team went deep into each team to conduct inspections and evaluations, and then classified and ranked the seedlings according to the results of the evaluation. The ranking results were: 250 mu of first-class seedlings, with neat and robust seedling growth; 170 mu of second-class seedlings, with relatively thin and weak seedlings and yellowing leaves; and 130 mu of third-class seedlings, with thin and weak seedlings and missing seedlings. The seedling stage requires full and strong seedlings, and they formulated management measures according to this requirement: universally apply a layer of old wall soil, irrigate once, combine thinning and setting seedlings with cultivating and weeding twice, and prevent insects once. In addition, the second and third-class seedlings should be replanted early, the seedling setting time should be appropriately delayed, and 20 jin of chemical fertilizer should be applied per mu. After formulating the measures, the production team cadres went to the teams to carry out field management competitions with the masses. Because the purpose was clear and the measures were specific, they quickly aroused greater enthusiasm and launched a competition movement. The first team took the lead, with an attendance rate of over 90% on the first day, and even several elderly people who did not participate in production in the past automatically participated in field management work. The production team spent only two days replanting 20 mu of third-class seedlings, applying chemical fertilizer once, and watering once. Other teams were not to be outdone, and they took turns day and night to accumulate fertilizer, transport fertilizer, irrigate, thin seedlings, replant seedlings, weed, and prevent insects. After ten days of fighting, they completed the various tasks ahead of schedule and basically eliminated the third-class seedlings. The second inspection and evaluation began on July 15th. The masses generally reflected: "Now we are spreading our wings again!"

To keep the masses constantly full of production enthusiasm, in addition to regular inspections, evaluations, classifications, and rankings, new management measures must be continuously added. After the second inspection and evaluation, they were classified and ranked according to new standards, and then new management measures were formulated. This time, the proposed measures were more than twice as many as the first time, such as applying two top dressings (once with 10,000 jin of manure per mu, and once with 25 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu), cultivating twice, earthing up twice, removing buds twice, and preventing insects and irrigating once each. In addition, it was also required to top-dress and irrigate the second and third-class seedlings.

Increasing measures is not blind, but based on the needs of corn growth during this period and the team's manpower and material resources. For example, earthing up twice is to increase the root system during the jointing period of corn. Every time the soil is earthed up, the corn grows a layer of roots. The more layers of roots, the more it can prevent lodging and fully absorb nutrients. The masses understand that increasing these measures is reasonable, and their enthusiasm is even greater. Not only do the teams compete with each other, but the members also challenge and respond to challenges; in addition to competing in the work of one stage, each team has established pacesetters in various management tasks, forming a hot wave of catching up. Du Chunmin, a skilled top-dresser, can apply fertilizer to 2.5 mu of land every day, applying it evenly without hurting the seedling roots, while ordinary members can only apply fertilizer to 1.5 or 6 fen of land a day, which has motivated many members to learn from him. The result of the whole team learning from pacesetters has improved labor efficiency. For example, in previous years, it took a week to earth up the 500 mu of corn once, but this year it only took four days for the first earthing up and only three days for the second earthing up. Another example is insect prevention. In the past, it was stipulated that one jin of wettable 666 should be mixed with 400 jin of water. This year, there has been an improvement. In the seedling stage, one jin of wettable 666 is mixed with 500 jin of water, which not only does not reduce the insect prevention effect, but also reduces the drug damage of 666 to the seedlings; during the jointing period, the seedlings are strong and the corn borers are also larger, so one jin of wettable 666 is mixed with 350 jin of water to improve the insecticidal efficacy of the pesticide. According to the inspection at the end of July, all the plans made in the second quarter competition have been basically completed, and only the management of the second and third-class seedlings (adding water and fertilizer to each plant) is still in progress. The third inspection, evaluation, classification, and ranking began on August 5th.

At present, although the weather is dry, the corn grown by the Fenghuo production team is still growing better than last year. Most of the corn plants are more than three feet tall, dark green in color, and the stalks are particularly thick. Recently, many representatives from various places came to visit the corn of the Fenghuo production team. They unanimously believe that this is the best-growing replanted corn in the Guanzhong area at present. (Zhu Bo)

    干劲越足措施越多　措施越多干劲越高
　　烽火队玉米田间管理好上加好
    本报西安11日电　著名的青年农民研究员、玉米丰产模范——陕西省乾县烽火公社社长王保京和他领导的烽火生产队，以先进的思想指导玉米丰产运动不断前进，使群众的劳动热情步步提高，增产措施节节深入。
    今年烽火生产队共种了五百五十亩回茬玉米，这是该队主要秋粮作物。在玉米丰产运动中最主要的问题是一些干部的情绪热一阵冷一阵，影响到丰产运动也紧一阵松一阵，玉米田间管理工作也随着好一阵差一阵，因此，各项措施执行的不彻底也不及时，玉米生长参差不齐，影响丰产计划的完成。还有人认为种玉米已有一套经验，不订措施也同样能丰产。又有些人认为夏播以后应当歇一歇。王保京和其他一些同志坚持正确的态度，对有这种思想的人们进行了教育，说明松劲思想的危害，并以本队一年比一年增产的实例教育大家，说明决不能原地踏步不前，必须在胜利的基础上争取新的胜利。
    为了使丰产运动步步深入，王保京提出在丰产运动中不断地检查评比、分类排队，不断地制订措施来指导生产。具体做法是根据玉米的幼苗、拔节、孕穗、扬花授粉、灌溉和成熟等生长过程，分为五个阶段，每一阶段都要检查评比，分类排队，并根据每一个阶段玉米生长的情况制订管理措施，使玉米田间管理工作精益求精，好里求好。第一次检查评比，是从7月5日开始的。检查组分别深入各小队进行检查评比，然后根据评比的结果对幼苗分类排队。排队的结果是：一类苗二百五十亩，幼苗生长整齐茁壮；二类苗一百七十亩，幼苗较细弱，苗色发黄；三类苗一百三十亩，幼苗细弱，缺苗。幼苗期要求苗全、苗壮，他们根据这项要求来制订管理措施：普遍施一次陈墙土，灌溉一次，结合间苗定苗中耕锄草两次，防虫一次。此外，二、三类苗要提早补种足，适当推迟定苗时间，每亩增施化肥二十斤。制定措施后，生产队干部就分头到小队，和群众一起开展田间管理竞赛。由于目的明确，措施具体，很快就鼓起了更高的干劲，展开了竞赛运动。第一小队一马当先，第一天出勤率达到90％以上，连过去不参加生产的几个老人也都自动参加了田间管理工作。这个生产队只用了两天的时间，就把二十亩三类苗补种好，施了一次化肥，浇了一次水。其他各队也不示弱，他们日夜轮番积肥、运肥和灌水、间苗、补苗和锄草防虫。经过十天战斗，提前完成了各项工作，基本上消灭了三类苗。从7月15日起又开始第二次检查评比。群众普遍反映：“现在又展开翅膀啦！”
    要使群众经常保持饱满的生产热情，除了经常检查评比和分类排队外，还要不断地增加新的管理措施。第二次检查评比后，又按照新的标准分类排队，然后制定新的管理措施。这次提出的措施比第一次多一倍以上，例如施两次追肥（一次每亩一万斤圈肥，一次每亩二十五斤化肥），中耕两次，培土两次、搬芽子二次以及防虫灌溉各一次。除此，还要求对二、三类苗追肥灌水。
    增加措施不是盲目的，而是根据这一时期玉米生长的需要和队的人力物力条件。例如两次培土是为了使玉米拔节期间增加根群，每培一次土，玉米就长一层根群，根群层数多了，就能防止倒伏和充分吸收营养。群众了解增加这些措施是合理的，干劲就更大了。不仅各小队之间展开竞赛，社员和社员也挑战应战；除了在一个阶段的工作上进行竞赛外，各小队在各项管理工作中，都树立了标兵，形成你追我赶的热潮。施追肥的能手杜春敏，每天能施肥二亩五分，施的均匀，不伤苗根，而一般的社员一天只能施一亩五、六分地，这就带动了许多社员向他学习。全队学习标兵的结果，提高了劳动效率。例如往年五百多亩玉米培土一次，需要一个星期，今年第一次培土只用了四天，第二次培土只用了三天。又如防虫，过去都是规定一斤可湿性的六六六配四百斤水，今年有了改进，在幼苗期，一斤可湿性的六六六配五百斤水，这样既不减轻防虫效果，又减轻六六六对幼苗的药害；在拔节期间，苗壮了，玉米螟也大了，就用一斤可湿性六六六配三百五十斤水，提高农药杀虫效力。据7月底检查，第二季度竞赛中所订的各项计划都基本完成了，只有二、三类苗的管理（逐株加水、加肥）还在进行。8月5日起开始进行第三次检查评比和分类排队。
    目前，虽然在天气干旱的情况下，烽火生产队的玉米生长得仍比去年好。大部分玉米株高都在三尺以上，颜色深绿，秆子特别粗壮。最近，各地来了很多代表参观烽火生产队的玉米，他们一致认为这是目前关中地区生长很好的回茬玉米。（朱波）
