Silage is a scientific method of storing forage. Different from the general method of sun-drying hay, it involves burying green forage in a silo, where it undergoes a fermentation process to maintain its green, juicy state and rich nutrients for a long time. This method is of great significance for expanding forage sources, improving forage quality, ensuring livestock health, and promoting livestock reproduction.

What are the specific benefits of silage? First, it can expand forage sources and improve the utilization rate of forage. Even corn stalks and sweet potato vines can be fully utilized after ensiling. Second, silage can preserve more nutrients, allowing livestock to obtain nutritional conditions close to those of summer in winter. Third, silage takes up relatively little space. Generally speaking, one cubic foot of space can hold more than 30 catties of silage, while the same space can only hold six or seven catties of hay. In addition, silage is buried in silos or silage towers, containing a large amount of water, and there is no risk of fire. Fourth, silage also has a certain effect on preventing diseases and insect pests. For example, the larvae of the corn borer mainly overwinter in corn stalks. If the corn stalks are ensiled, they can be killed. Silage is green and juicy, and when fed in combination with other feeds, it can also improve the digestibility and utilization rate of other feeds.

The size of the silo should be determined according to the amount of silage raw materials. The shape of the silo is generally round or rectangular. Round silos can be used for small quantities of silage (such as 20,000 to 30,000 catties), and rectangular silos can be used for large quantities of silage. (Attached picture)

    青贮饲料和青贮窖
    青贮是贮存饲草的科学方法。它和一般晒贮干草办法不同，是把青绿的饲草埋在窖里，经过发酵过程，长期保持青绿多汁的状态和丰富的养分。这种方法对扩大饲草来源，提高饲草质量，保证牲畜健康，促进牲畜繁殖，都有重大作用。
    青贮的具体好处是什么呢？第一、能够扩大饲草来源和提高饲草的利用率。既使玉米秸和红薯藤在青贮以后也可以全部利用。第二、青贮可以保存较多的养分，使家畜在冬季能得到接近夏季的营养条件。第三、青贮饲料所占的地方比较节省，一般来说，一立方尺的地方可以装青贮饲料三十多斤，如装干草只能装六、七斤。此外，青贮饲料是埋在青贮窖或青贮塔里，含有大量的水分，没有失火的危险。第四、青贮对防止病虫害也有一定的作用。例如玉米钻心虫的幼虫主要藏在玉米秸里越冬，如果把玉米秸青贮起来，就可以把它杀死。青贮饲料青绿多汁，和其他饲料搭配喂用，还能提高其他饲料的消化利用率。
    青贮窖的大小要根据青贮原料的多少而定。窖的形状一般有圆形，长方形两种，青贮数量不多的（如二、三万斤）可用圆形窖，青贮数量多的可用长方形窖。（附图片）
