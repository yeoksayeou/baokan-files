(Our Dispatch from Xining, August 19th) Reporter Zhao Huaiqing reports: The Party Committee of Chaka Commune in Ulan County, Qinghai Province, standing at the forefront of the production battle, participates in production and leads production, uniting the masses closely, and working together to vigorously develop production, so that livestock production has yielded fruitful results in the past year. In the year of communization, the total number of livestock in the commune increased by 21%. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee recently held an on-site meeting here, and decided to promote the leadership method of this commune's Party committee throughout the province.

The members of the Chaka Commune Party Committee often work in the pastures, eat, live, and work with the members, care about the lives of the members, do ideological work anytime and anywhere, and encourage the enthusiasm of the members. Liu Sanmao (Han nationality), the first secretary of the commune party committee, in order to widely talk with the masses and make friends, actively learned the Mongolian language (most of the members are Mongolian), and quickly adapted to the pastoral life. During the lambing season last winter and this spring, some herdsmen were afraid of hardship. Secretary Liu, braving the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, grazed with the members during the day, and to take care of the herdsmen's rest at night, he himself put on an old sheepskin, took a lambing bag, and slept in the sheepfold. Party committee members such as Zhou Jia and Sangteerjia, in the most tense days of lambing, slept no more than four hours a night for more than a month. The herdsmen said with emotion: "Secretary Liu and the cadres are working so happily, who would we be letting down if we didn't work hard!" They kept watch at night, and some vacated their tents to keep the lambs warm, and slept in the open air themselves. A herdsman named Yiba did not sleep at home for more than a month. In addition, the commune party committee is also very concerned about the lives of the members. In order to improve the lives of the members, they led the members to hunt more than 10,000 catties of wild animals, reducing the slaughter of livestock. The members said: "The Party cares about us and understands our hearts."

The commune party committee works practically and is good at contacting the masses. When deploying and executing tasks, they first carefully and seriously study the Party's guidelines and policies in this regard, as well as the measures, basis, and conditions for achieving the tasks, and widely publicize them to the masses, and let them launch discussions. Then, according to the Party's policies and the opinions of the masses, put forward loud action slogans, and implement them flexibly and in accordance with local conditions. In this way, the masses not only accepted the Party's policies, but also knew the specific goals of struggle. For example, when implementing the Party's eight measures of "water, grass, management, breeding, planting, agriculture, prevention, and work" in animal husbandry production, the party committee held many symposiums with old herdsmen. At the meeting, the masses, according to the local terrain, water and grass, and climate, proposed different grazing methods in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as well as effective methods such as reducing the size of livestock groups and utilizing small grasslands. The commune party committee implemented the eight measures flexibly according to these opinions, and the effect was very good. This year's "summer fattening" work is better than any previous year.

In addition, the commune party committee also pays attention to cultivating typical examples and establishing pacesetters. At the beginning of each new work, they choose a production team as the key experimental group, and after gaining successful experience, they promote it in an all-round way. For example, this spring, lamb dysentery was prevalent, and the secretary of the commune party committee personally dissected a sick sheep in the experimental group, and worked with old herdsmen and veterinarians to study and determine the condition, and came up with a treatment method of injecting musk liquid. After this method was promoted, all the sick sheep were cured.

Because the cadres of this commune lead deeply, the party members take the lead everywhere, and the members are very motivated. Now each production team has universally launched a competition to let livestock eat well, drink well, and gain weight. In order to make the livestock plump and fleshy, the herdsmen enter the summer pastures twenty days to a month in advance, extending the grazing time. Some herdsmen work hard day and night, striving to eliminate third-class fatness and achieve full fatness and full pregnancy.

　　干部牧场办公社员个个称好
　　茶卡公社党委领导深入具体
　　青海省委召开现场会议推广这一经验
    本报西宁19日电　记者赵淮青报道：中共青海乌兰县茶卡公社党委，站在生产战线的最前哨，参加生产领导生产，把群众紧紧团结起来，同心协力大搞生产，使一年来的畜牧业生产结出丰硕的果实。公社化的一年中全公社牲畜增加了21％。中共青海省委最近在这里举行了现场会议，决定在全省推广这个公社党委的领导方法。
    中共茶卡公社党委委员，经常在牧场上办公，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，关心社员生活，随时随地作思想工作，鼓舞社员干劲。公社党委第一书记刘三茂（汉族），为了广泛地和群众谈心、交朋友，积极学习蒙语（大部社员是蒙族），很快适应了牧区生活。去冬今春接羔季节，有的放牧员怕艰苦，刘书记冒着零下二十多度的严寒，白天和社员一块放牧，夜晚为照顾放牧员休息，自己就披件老羊皮，拿着接羔袋，睡在羊圈里。周加、桑特尔加等党委委员，在接羔最紧张的日子里，有一个多月每晚睡不过四小时。牧民群众感动地说：“刘书记、干部都干得这么欢，咱们不下狠劲，对得起谁！”他们纷纷夜晚守圈，有的把帐房让出来为羊羔保暖，自己睡在露天里。有个叫已巴的放牧员，一个多月没回家睡过。另外，公社党委还非常关心社员生活。为了改善社员生活，他们带领社员打了一万多斤野生动物，减少了宰杀牲畜。社员说：“党关心我们，了解咱的心。”
    公社党委工作踏实，善于联系群众。在布置和执行任务时，他们首先认真严肃地研究党在这方面的方针、政策，以及实现任务的措施、根据和条件，并且普遍地向群众宣传，并让他们展开讨论。然后，再根据党的政策和群众的意见，提出响亮的行动口号，灵活地、因地制宜地执行。这样，群众既接受了党的政策，又知道了具体的奋斗目标。比如，在执行党在牧业生产上的“水、草、管、繁、种、农、防、工”八项措施时，党委就连续召开了多次老牧民的座谈会。会上，群众根据当地的地势、水草和气候，提出春夏秋冬不同的放牧方法，以及划小畜群、利用小块草原等行之有效的办法。公社党委根据这些意见，灵活地执行八项措施，效果很好。今年的“夏膘”工作比过去任何一年都好。
    另外，公社党委还注意培养典型，树立标兵。每一项新的工作开始，他们都选择一个生产队作重点搞试验群，取得成功经验后，再全面推广。比如，今春羊羔痢疾流行，公社党委书记便亲自把试验群里一只病羊解剖，和老牧民、兽医研究，确定病情，想出了注射麝香液的治疗方法。这一方法推广后，病羊便全部治好了。
    这个公社由于干部领导深入，党员处处带头，社员干劲都很大。现在各生产队普遍展开让牲畜吃好、喝好、抓好膘的评比竞赛。为了让牲畜膘满肉肥，牧民们提前二十天到一个月进入夏季牧场，延长放牧时间。有的放牧员夜以继日地苦干，力争消灭三等膘，全部满膘满怀。
