　　New Force Added to the Northeast Power Grid
　　Second Phase of Jilin Thermal Power Plant Completed
    Xinhua News Agency: The second phase of construction of China's newly built large-scale thermal power plant - Jilin Thermal Power Plant - has been fully completed. The newly installed No. 6 generating unit officially began transmitting electricity to the Northeast Power Grid on the 5th.
    This phase of the project began in the first quarter of last year. In this phase, Nos. 5 and 6 high-temperature and high-pressure steam turbine generator units were to be installed. No. 5 unit and its auxiliary equipment were already generating electricity by the end of last year. Before installing the No. 6 unit, the workers summarized their past construction experience and comprehensively improved construction organization management and technical management in the installation process, strengthened construction preparation work, and inspection of equipment, materials, and installation quality, which reduced the installation time of the No. 6 unit by 43 days compared to the No. 5 unit. After trial operation and acceptance, the project quality was proven to be good. In the entire second phase of construction, civil construction and installation met the design standards.
    This thermal power plant was built with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Nos. 5 and 6 units were manufactured by the Soviet Union and installed with the help of Soviet experts. Many advanced technological achievements were adopted, and electronic automatic regulators were installed, allowing operating workers to grasp the operating conditions based on the instruments.
    Currently, the thermal power plant is also carrying out the third and fourth phases of the project in full swing.

　　东北电力网新增生力军
　　吉林热电厂第二期工程完工
    新华社讯　我国新建的大型热电厂——吉林热电厂的第二期工程全部完工。新安装的第六号机组已经从5日起正式向东北电力网送电。
    这期工程是从去年第一季度开始施工的。在这期工程中，要安装五号六号两台高温高压汽轮发电机组。五号机组和它的辅助设备已在去年年底发电。在安装六号机组之前，职工们总结了过去施工的经验，安装中全面地改进了施工组织管理和技术管理，加强了施工准备工作以及对设备、材料、安装质量的检查，使六号机组的安装时间比五号机组的安装时间缩短了四十三天。经过试运转和验收，证明工程质量良好。在整个第二期建设工程中，土木建筑和安装都达到了设计标准。
    这座热电厂是苏联帮助我国建设的。五号、六号机组都是由苏联制造并由苏联专家帮助安装的。其中采用了许多先进技术成就，装有电子自动调节器，操作工人根据仪表便可以掌握运行情况。
    目前，这个热电厂还在紧张进行第三期、第四期工程。
