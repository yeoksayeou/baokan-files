A Good Sentinel in Production
　　——An Interview with the Folk Meteorologists of Changhou Commune
　　By Our Reporters Li Jinting and Hu Jian

　　At noon on July 19th, the sky was clear, perfect for sun-drying grain. However, in the grain-drying yards of the Changhou Commune in Nanxian County, bordering Dongting Lake, large piles of grain were being covered with rice straw and mats. Passersby were curious. An old man in the drying yard stroked his beard and smiled at everyone: "The weather station says it will thunder and rain this afternoon!"

　　Sure enough, not long after, a strong wind rose, and dark clouds rolled in from the southeast. Thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, and rain began to fall. Because they were prepared early, the grain did not get wet. Everyone praised the weather station as a "good sentinel in production."

　　Speaking of the Changhou Commune weather station, there is a touching story behind it. In October last year, in order to lead the masses to overcome natural disasters, the Commune Party Committee sent Communist Youth League members Duan Zuochun and Cui Shuchun (female) to study meteorology. These two young people were very enthusiastic and learned general weather forecasting knowledge in just twenty days. After returning to the commune, they were very enthusiastic and prepared to establish a weather station, which they calculated would cost more than 2,000 yuan. The commune was newly established, and there were too many places to spend money. Where could they find so much money to set up a weather station? The secretary of the Commune Party Committee told them to find folk methods among the masses. So they went to visit old farmers. On the first day, the old farmer Deng Dongnan taught them many agricultural proverbs for predicting sunny and cloudy weather, and also told them that if leeches in the field floated to the surface or climbed onto the ridges, there would be a storm. They immediately caught three different leeches for testing, and it was indeed accurate. From then on, they often learned from old farmers. The masses were also enthusiastic in helping them. During the day, while working with the commune members, the old farmers taught them to observe the sky, distinguish the direction of the clouds, and listen to "frog songs" at night. On the road, they looked at the mimosa, and observed the movements of ants and water snakes. The chicken farmer said: "If chickens do not enter the coop, rain is imminent." The cook said, "If there are white bubbles in the pickle jar, there may be thunderstorms," and the duck farmer said, "If egrets gather in flocks, wind and rain are coming." Soon, they collected eighty-nine kinds of animals and plants and more than three hundred agricultural proverbs. They did comparative tests one by one, and the results were very good. Without spending a penny, they set up a weather station and organized old farmers to form a weather sentry. After listening to the weather forecast news every day, they combined the local people's rich weather forecasting experience with the indoor and outdoor animals and plants' reactions to the climate to carry out "supplementary forecasts," with an accuracy rate of about 98%, which played a great advisory role in guiding production.

　　During the early rice harvest season, we came to the weather station. This was a small house, the walls of which were covered with silk banners, weather diaries, proverbs, and small notebooks with observation records. On a long table were more than a dozen glass bottles, raising animals and plants such as leeches, loaches, and snails. The young meteorologists Duan Zuochun and Cui Shuchun had just returned from the fields after harvesting rice. As usual, they first went to the weather observation room to see what their cultivated clever little animals and little plants felt about today's weather. It was a sunny day, and the leeches and loaches were quietly lurking in the mud at the bottom of the bottle. The snails were floating on the surface of the water, the gunpowder was not damp, and the malt was loose. All were signs of clear weather. They wrote these phenomena in the weather diary.

　　"These are our living weather instruments!" Duan Zuochun began to introduce their weather forecasting work to us. This son of a poor peasant was only twenty-one years old this year. He liked playing with leeches and loaches since he was a child, and loved to listen to old people telling stories and proverbs about weather forecasting, such as "Clouds moving south, rain in clusters; clouds moving east, all in vain; clouds moving west, rain pattering." He had loved singing these weather songs since he was a child, and now he had a thick notebook full of records. Although he only studied in junior high school for one year, he knew a lot about meteorology. He could measure rainfall, evaporation, humidity and temperature changes. Everyone called him "Little Meteorologist." He pointed to the small animals and plants on the table and introduced to us: "Don't underestimate these things, they are very sensitive to weather changes! But they have to be replaced every ten days or so, otherwise they will become lazy." He told us an interesting story.

　　On March 28th, it was the season for raising early and mid-season rice seedlings. In the morning, they were working in the fields and found "white threads" flying all over the sky, which the locals called "wind threads." The old people said, "If wind threads roam, there will be a big wind." Some old people also said: Last night was sweltering, the foundations were damp, and snakes were blocking the road, so the weather was going to change. They ran to the weather observation room and were frightened! The loaches were tumbling around in the bottles, and five leeches broke through the gauze at the mouth of the bottle and ran away. The two young meteorologists had never seen such a sudden change before. They thought that there must be a cold wave and storm coming. However, the weather forecast from the county only said that there would be a force six wind, and did not mention the attack of a major cold wave. At that time, the weather was also very clear. How should the weather forecast be issued? They came to the Commune Party Committee, and the secretary of the Party Committee believed that since the loaches, leeches, etc. had strong reactions, they should be "prepared for the worst," and ordered the weather station to immediately raise the "white flag," and the commune issued an emergency notice of a cold wave warning.

　　At 11:00 a.m., alarm bells and gongs sounded everywhere in the commune, and more than 30,000 people plunged into the battle against wind and cold. At that time, the whole commune had hundreds of thousands of catties of seed grain, all of which were ready to be sown in the mud in the next few days, and only one-third had been sown. The Commune Party Committee decided to temporarily stop sowing. More than 3,000 mu of seedling fields that had already been sown were thickly sprinkled with a layer of grass ash, and windbreaks were universally set up. Some houses exposed to the wind were also reinforced. At that time, it was sunny, and some people were skeptical about the cold wave and strong winds, but seeing that the weather station's past weather forecasts were accurate, they waited and watched.

　　At 5:00 p.m., the cold wave came, with winds reaching force nine, and some hail was brought in the wind and rain. However, because they were prepared early, the losses were small. The seed grain sown in the mud survived a cold wave, and this year the seedlings are growing very well. Therefore, everyone said that this year's early rice harvest was due in part to the weather station.

　　Duan Zuochun said while introducing their weather forecasting work: They listen to the above weather forecast broadcasts, observe the living reactions of indoor and outdoor animals and plants, and consult the old farmers' experience in observing the sky, and combine several aspects to carry out forecasting work. He especially mentioned that the "weather sentry" composed of five experienced old farmers here was of great help to them in forecasting the weather.

　　On June 7th, they encountered a difficult problem in forecasting the weather, which was solved with the help of the old people of the "weather sentry." That day, they observed that the small leeches were floating on the surface of the water, the loaches were also active, and the snails had all sunk. These observations indicated that a storm was coming. At that time, they learned that the commune was carrying out a large-scale pest control campaign, and had just bought back more than 2,000 catties of pesticides, worth more than 1,400 yuan, and were preparing to concentrate on spraying them on the rice fields on the 8th to kill the pests. If there was really a thunderstorm, the pesticide's insecticidal effect would be greatly reduced after the rain, which would be a great loss. The two young people felt that their responsibility was very heavy. However, they lacked experience and could not make a decision on the issue at once. So they held a meeting with the old farmers of the "weather sentry" to discuss the problem.

　　Chen Xiting, the leader of the "weather sentry," said: "The setting sun in the water is rouge red, if it doesn't rain, it will be windy." He said that it would rain on the 8th, and everyone agreed with his opinion based on their own observations. According to the weather station's forecast, the Commune Party Committee issued an emergency notice ordering all production teams to temporarily stop spraying pesticides. At noon on the 8th, there was indeed a heavy rain. They sprayed pesticides to kill insects after the rain, and the insecticidal effect was much greater. Since then, the weather station has gained more credibility among the masses.

　　As we passed through the fields, a scene was even more attractive. Recently, there had been a long period without rain, and the soil in other places was very short of water, but the ditches, canals, and ponds here were full of water, and the fields were irrigated with two or three inches of water. Yang Yijiang, director of the Commune Office, said proudly: This is also due to the weather station. It turned out that as early as the end of June, under the leadership of the Commune Party Committee, the weather station held discussions with experienced old farmers about the weather in July. At that time, the old farmers of the "weather sentry" said: If the south wind blows during the minor heat this year, there will definitely be a long period of sunny weather. They combined this with the information from the higher-level meteorological station and issued a forecast of a long period of sunny weather without rain. Before "rushing to harvest and rushing to plant," the Commune Party Committee started to rush to repair 1,800 waterwheels, and transferred more than 3,000 laborers to form a drought resistance team, using the high water level of the outer river to open the gates to store water and resist drought early. Now, although it has not rained for three or forty days, the more than 40,000 mu of mid- and late-season rice and more than 20,000 mu of cotton and jute in the entire commune have enough river water for irrigation and are growing well. The commune members composed a folk song to send to the weather station: "The weather station foresees the future, and the wind and rain news spread down, rushing to harvest and rushing to plant are well arranged, how can we forget the return of the grains home."

　　The commune members of Changhou Commune broke the shackles of relying on the heavens. Old farmers and experienced commune members, with the help of the weather station, established many "weather sentries," and observed the weather every day to help the commune arrange production.

　　生产上的好哨兵
　　——访长厚公社土法气象家
　　本报记者　李进挺　胡　坚
    7月19日中午，晴空万里，正是好晒谷天。可是洞庭湖滨南县长厚公社的晒谷场上，一个接一个的大谷堆，这时都用稻草、晒簟盖起来了。过路的人，都感到很奇怪。晒谷场上的老年人捋着胡子，向大家笑一笑：“气象站说得准，今天午后有雷雨啦！”
    果然时过不久，狂风大作，团团黑云从东南滚滚而来。雷鸣电闪，下起雨来。他们准备得早，谷子没有淋湿。大家都夸奖气象站是“生产上的好哨兵”。
    提起长厚公社气象站，这里有一段动人的故事。去年10月，公社党委为了领导群众战胜自然灾害，就派共青团员段作春、崔淑纯（女）去学习气象。这两个年轻人干劲很大，只二十天就学会了一般的气象预报知识。回到公社后，他们热情很高，准备建立气象站，一计算就得花两千多元。公社才建立，用钱的地方太多了，那里拿得出这么多钱办气象站。公社党委书记告诉他们到群众中去找土办法。他们便去走访老农。第一天，老农邓东南教给了许多预测晴阴的农谚，还告诉他们田里
  的蚂蟥，如果浮到水面或爬到田塍上来，就会有风暴。他们马上捉了三条不同的蚂
  蟥试验，果然不错。这一来，他们就常常
  向老农学习。群众也热心帮他们。白天，
  同社员一起生产时，老农教给他们看天色，辨别云向，晚上听“青蛙唱歌”。走在路上看含羞草、看蚂蚁、水蛇的动静。养鸡的饲养员说：“鸡不入笼，阴雨将临”。炊事员说，“腌菜坛子鼓白泡，可能有雷雨”，养鸭的说：“鹭鸶成群，风雨将临”。很快，他们就搜集了八十九种动植物和三百多首农谚。他们一个个作对比试验，结果效果很好。没花一个钱办起了气象站，还组织老农成立了气象哨。他们每天收听气象预报消息后，结合当地群众丰富的气象预测经验和室内外动植物对气候的反应，进行
  “补充预报”，准确率达到98％左右，对领导生产，起了很大的参谋作用。
    早稻丰收的季节，我们来到气象站。这是一间小房子，墙壁上挂满了锦旗，挂满了有关天气变化的日记、谚语和观测纪录等小本本。一条长桌上摆了十多个玻璃瓶，养着蚂蟥、泥鳅、田螺等动植物。年轻的气象员段作春和崔淑纯，刚从田间扮禾回来，他们照例先到气象观测室，看看他们培养的灵巧的小动物、小植物对今天的天气有些什么感觉。那天是个大晴天，蚂蝗、泥鳅安静地潜伏在瓶底的泥土里，田螺浮在水面，火药不潮，麦芽松散，一切都是天气晴朗的征兆。他们把这些现象，写在天气日记本上。
    “这是我们的活气象仪啦”！段作春开始向我们介绍他们的气象预报工作，这位贫农的儿子，今年才二十一岁，从小就喜欢玩蚂蟥、泥鳅，爱听老年人讲预测天气的故事、谚语，什么“云走南，雨成团；云走东，一场空；云走西，雨凄凄”。这些天气歌谣，他从小就爱唱，现在他的小本本上，还厚厚地记录了一本子。他虽然只在初中念过一年书，可是他懂得很多气象知识，他会测雨量，蒸发量，湿度和温度的变化。大家都叫他“小气象家”。他指着桌上的小动植物向我们介绍：“你别小看这些东西，对天气变化反映可灵敏啦！不过隔十来天就得调换，不然它们会变懒的。”他向我们讲了一个有趣的故事。
      3月28日，正是早、中稻的育秧季节。上午，他们在田间生产，发现满天飞“白线子”，当地群众叫“风丝”。老年人说：“风丝游，有大风”。还有些老年人说：昨晚炸热，屋基回潮蛇拦路，天气要变了。他们跑到气象观测室一看，可把他们吓坏了！泥鳅在瓶子里乱翻腾，五条蚂蟥都冲破瓶口的纱布，跑走了。两位年轻的气象员从没有见过这样突变的情况，他们想，准是有寒潮大风暴来。可是，先天县里的气象预报只说有六级风，并没有说到大寒潮的袭击。当时天气又很晴朗，天气预报该怎样发呢？他们来到公社党委会，党委书记认为既然泥鳅、蚂蟥等都有强烈反应，要“有备无患”，叫气象站马上升起“白旗”，公社发出寒潮警报的紧急通知。
    上午十一点钟，全公社到处响起一片警钟声、锣鼓声，三万多人投入了防风防寒潮的战斗。当时全社有几十万斤种谷，都准备那几天播下泥，刚播三分之一，公社党委会就决定暂时停止播种。已经播种的三千多亩秧田，厚厚地撒下一层草木灰，普遍扎了防风棚。有些当风的房屋也进行了加固，当时是晴天，说是有寒潮大风，开始有些人半信半疑，但是看到气象站过去预报天气变化还准，就等着瞧。
    下午五点钟，寒潮来了，风力达到九级，风雨中还带来一些冰雹。但是，他们准备得早，损失很少，种谷下泥躲过了一个寒潮，今年秧苗都长得很好。因此，大家说今年早稻丰收，也有气象站一份功劳。
    段作春在介绍他们的气象预报工作时说：他们是听上面的气象预报广播、看室内外动植物的生活反映，访问老农的看天经验，几个方面综合起来，进行预报工作的。他特别提到这里由五位有看天经验的老农组成的“气象哨”，给他们预报天气的帮助很大。
    6月7日，他们在预报天气时碰到一个难题，就是“气象哨”的老年人帮助他们解决的。那天，他们观察小蚂蟥浮上了水面，泥鳅也活跃起来了，田螺丝都沉下去了。物象观察是暴风要来了。当时他们了解社里正开展大规模的治虫运动，刚买回两千多斤药剂，价值一千四百多元，准备在8号那天集中撒到稻田里扑灭虫害。如果真的有雷阵雨，雨一淋药剂杀虫效力就会大大降低，这是一个很大的损失。这两位年轻人，越想越感到自己责任重大。但是自己经验不足，一下子又决定不了这个问题。他们就和“气象哨”的老年农民一起开会来讨论这个问题。
  “气象哨”组长陈喜亭说：“太阳落水胭脂红，不雨便是风”。他说8号会下雨，大家也根据自己的观察都同意他这个意见。公社党委会根据气象站的预报，发出紧急通知，要各生产队暂时停止喷药。8号中午，果真下了一场大雨。他们在雨后再进行喷药杀虫，杀虫效力大得多。从此，气象站在群众中更加有了信誉。
    当我们从田野经过，一幅情景更吸引人，近来久晴不雨，别处田土十分缺水，但这里的沟港、渠道、塘坝里水装得很满，田里都灌有两三寸水。公社办公室主任杨一江自豪的说：这也是气象站立的功。原来，早在6月底，在公社党委领导下，气象站与有经验的老农座谈了7月份的天气。当时“气象哨”的老农都说：今年小暑刮南风，一定会久晴。他们便结合上级气象台的情报，发出了久晴无雨的预报。公社党委在“抢收抢种”前，就着手赶修了一千八百辆水车，抽调出三千多个劳力，组成抗旱专业队，利用外河水位高涨，开闸蓄水，提早抗旱。现在虽然已经三、四十天没有下雨了，全公社四万多亩中、晚稻，两万多亩棉花、黄麻，都有足够的河水灌溉。生长得很好。社员编了一首山歌送给气象站：“未卜先知气象台，风雨消息传下来，抢收抢插安排好，颗粒还家怎忘怀。”（附图片）
    长厚公社社员打破了靠天的思想束缚。老农和有经验的社员，在气象站帮助下成立了很多个“气象哨”，每天都要观察天气，以便帮助社里安排生产
