Showing Concern for the Masses Everywhere, Constantly Improving Work Style:
    Yun Jin Team's Party Members and Masses are of One Mind and Full of Energy

The Communist Party members of the Yun Jin Production Team have adopted various methods to integrate with the masses, and the relationship between the Party and the masses is very harmonious. Their experience is: (1) When implementing the Party's policies and tasks, they patiently persuade and educate the masses on the one hand, and lead by example on the other; (2) They frequently listen to the voices and opinions of the masses and promptly report them to the Party organization; (3) They care about the lives of the masses and help solve specific difficulties for the members.

(Dispatch from our newspaper) Reporters Li Qinyuan and Huang Ye report: The Yun Jin Production Team Party Branch of Yunxi Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, gives full play to the exemplary role of Party members in the work groups, unites the masses, and manages production very well.

The Yun Jin Production Team Party Branch has a total of five Party members, four of whom serve as work group leaders. They are able to maintain close contact with the masses, consult with the masses on everything, are good at listening to the opinions of the masses, care about the lives of the masses in every way, and often play a leading exemplary role, uniting the entire work group like a family, and the relationship between the Party and the masses is very harmonious.

An important role played by Party members in the work groups is: when implementing the Party's policies and work tasks, they patiently persuade and educate the masses, explain the policies to the masses, explain the reasons clearly, and lead by example everywhere, influencing the masses. In the face of arduous and tense tasks, Party members always stand on the front line. For example, recently, forty or so mu of the seventy mu of mid-season rice in the Second Work Group had already become dehydrated, and drought resistance was imminent, but some members had inconsistent ideological understandings. Some said, "The double-rush harvest and planting is so tight, there is no time to do drought resistance. Doing drought resistance will take too much energy." When Ding Jizhen, the Party member work group leader, saw this situation, he launched a wide-ranging discussion among the members. Through the discussion, the members realized that if they did not actively organize drought resistance and damaged the mid-season rice, it would affect this year's total grain output and bring serious losses to their lives. On the other hand, they also reasonably readjusted the labor force for the double-rush harvest and drought resistance, ensuring that both the double-rush harvest and drought resistance were carried out without any delays. At the same time, he himself took the lead in actively participating in the drought resistance struggle. On the first day of water-wheeling for drought resistance, while the members were still eating dinner, he and Communist Youth League member Lu Chucheng set up the waterwheels in advance, waiting for the members to finish eating and go to water-wheel. After dinner, he carried a waterwheel to the steepest and most laborious place to water-wheel.

Another important role played by Party members in the work groups is that they can often listen to the voices and opinions of the masses and promptly report them to the Party organization. In March of this year, when this production team was formulating this year's production plan, the cadres initially considered that there was a shortage of labor and feared that they would not be able to cope with too much work, so they planned to leave one hundred and fifty mu of poorly conditioned fields unplanted, and strive for high yields and more harvests on other land. Party member Mao Donglin (work group leader), during in-depth visits, member Qiu Yongfu said: "Since communization, there are more people and more strength than in advanced cooperatives, but it is really wrong to abandon the old fields. To increase income and improve living standards, we cannot do this. Everyone has to work a little harder and not abandon the original fields." Mao Donglin immediately reported these opinions to the Party branch. The Party branch carefully studied them and believed that the members' opinions were correct, so they revised the production plan. In this way, not only was not a single field abandoned, but the members also made full use of the scattered land in front of and behind their houses and along the railway, expanding the planting area.

The Party members in the work groups also play a great role in caring for the lives of the members in every possible way, which has also played a great role in strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses. They often visit the homes of the members and help them solve specific difficulties. This year, when planting early rice, poor peasant member Lu Xianhe contracted typhoid fever. Mao Shulin (Party member), the leader of the First Work Group, immediately reported the situation to the Party branch. Yi Guomin, the Party branch secretary, brought some noodles and white sugar to Lu Xianhe's home to express his condolences, and borrowed more than ten yuan to send Lu Xianhe to the county to receive medical treatment. Lu Xianhe's family was very grateful. The Party branch of this production team also stipulated a system: the Party members of the work groups meet regularly to study the problems of the members in life and production, and try to solve them quickly. If members lack rain gear when going to work on rainy days, the branch suggests that the production team try to purchase or organize the members to process them. Many specific problems of the members in production and life are solved in time, and their production enthusiasm is very full, and the tasks are completed well and quickly. Party members care about the masses everywhere, and the masses also care about the Party members everywhere. For example, Yi Guomin, the Party branch secretary, often suffers from stomach problems, but he always hides it and doesn't tell others. Ding Guigu, the cook in the canteen, noticed that he only ate very little food at each meal, so she took the opportunity when the brigade health worker came to the work group for mobile medical treatment to inquire whether Secretary Yi was ill. The brigade health worker told her that Secretary Yi's stomach problem was very serious and that he could only eat some porridge and could not eat chili peppers and other highly irritating foods. After listening to the health worker's words, Ding Guigu cooked a pot of porridge for Secretary Yi separately in a small pot for each meal, and when cooking vegetables, she left him a portion without chili peppers.

    处处关心群众　不断改进作风
    云锦队党员和群众心齐劲足
    云锦生产队的共产党员，采取种种办法和群众打成一片，党群关系非常融洽。他们的经验是：（1）在贯彻执行党的方针政策和工作任务时，一方面耐心说服教育群众，一方面以身作则；（2）经常倾听群众的呼声和意见，及时反映给党组织；（3）关心群众生活，帮助社员解决具体困难。
    本报讯　记者李沁源、黄叶报道：湖南临湘县云溪公社云锦生产队党支部充分发挥作业组党员的模范作用，团结群众，把生产搞得很出色。
    云锦生产队党支部共有五个党员，其中有四个担任了作业组长的职务。他们能够密切联系群众，遇事跟群众商量，善于倾听群众意见，处处关心群众生活，经常起带头模范作用，把整个作业组团结得像一家人一样，党群关系非常融洽。
    党员在作业组中发挥的一个重要作用是：在贯彻执行党的方针政策和工作任务的时候，耐心说服教育群众，向群众交代政策，讲清道理；并且以身作则，处处带头，影响群众。在艰巨而又紧张的任务面前，党员总是站在第一线。如最近第二作业组的七十亩中稻就有四十来亩已经脱水，抗旱刻不容缓，但是有部分社员思想认识不一致，有的说：“抢收抢插这么紧，没有时间搞抗旱，要抗旱精力支持不过来。”党员作业组长丁继珍看到这个情况，就发动社员广泛讨论，通过讨论使社员都认识到如果不积极组织抗旱，干坏了中稻，就将影响今年粮食总产量，会给生活带来严重的损失；另一方面又重新合理调整了双抢和抗旱的劳力，做到了双抢、抗旱两不误。同时自己也带头积极参加了抗旱斗争。开始车水抗旱的第一天，社员还在吃晚饭的时候，他就和共青团员闾处成一起事先把水车都架好，只等社员吃完饭去车水，饭后他就背一架水车，到坡度最陡、费力最大的地方去车水。
    作业组党员起的另一个重要作用是能够经常倾听群众的呼声和意见，并及时反映给党组织。今年3月份，这个生产队在制定今年生产规划的时候，干部们开始考虑到劳力少，怕工作多了做不过来，准备把一百五十亩条件较差的田丢下不种，在其他的土地上争取高产多收。党员毛东林（作业组长）在深入访问的时候，社员丘永富说：“公社化了，比高级社人多力量大，反而把老田丢了，实在不应该。要增加收入，改善生活，就不能这样做，大家再辛苦一点也不能把原来的田丢了。”毛东林把这些意见立即反映到党支部，党支部认真作了研究，认为社员的意见是正确的，便重新修订了生产规划。这样，不仅一分田没有丢，社员还把屋前屋后、铁路边上的零星土地都充分利用起来，扩大了种植面积。
    作业组里的党员们对社员生活无微不至地关怀，对于密切党和群众的关系也起了很大作用。他们经常深入社员家庭访问，帮助社员解决具体困难。今年插早稻的时候，贫农社员芦先和得了伤寒病，第一作业组的组长毛束林（党员）立即把情况反映给党支部，支部书记易国民就带些挂面和白糖到芦先和家里慰问，并且借了十多块钱把芦先和送到县里去治病，芦先和一家人都很感激。这个生产队的党支部还规定了一项制度：作业组的党员定期碰头，研究社员在生活和生产上的问题，并设法迅速解决。社员雨天出工缺雨具，支部就建议生产队设法采购或组织社员加工。社员在生产、生活上许多具体问题及时得到解决，生产情绪都很饱满，任务完成得又好又快。党员处处关心群众，群众也处处关心党员。如支部书记易国民经常发胃病，但是自己一直瞒着不告诉别人，食堂炊事员丁桂姑发现他每顿只吃很少的饭，就趁大队卫生员来作业组巡回医疗的机会打听易书记是不是有病，大队卫生员告诉她说：易书记胃病很严重，只能吃些稀的，不能吃辣椒等刺激性很强的食物。丁桂姑听了卫生员的话，就每顿用一个小罐子单独给易书记熬一罐粥，煮菜的时候就另外给他留一份没有辣椒的菜。
