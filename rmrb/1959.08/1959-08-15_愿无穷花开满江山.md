　　May Hibiscus Bloom All Over the Land

　　Throughout history, no matter how tortuous and complex human history has been, victory ultimately belongs to the people. In the history of the Korean people, August 15th is an immortal symbol of victory. We can never forget the indomitable struggle of the Korean people. When Japanese fascism was like an iron yoke on the necks of the Korean people, what a tragic life the Korean people experienced. But they never bowed their heads, and generation after generation, they continued to wage various struggles. How many people sacrificed their lives for the freedom of their motherland, how many people abandoned their wives and children, left their homes, crossed the Tumen River, and took up arms to join the ranks of the battle. These struggles, combined with the anti-fascist struggles of the people of the world, formed an irresistible torrent. Finally, on August 15th, fourteen years ago, they broke the shackles, gained freedom, and buried Japanese fascism at the bottom of history.
　　Once, I also spent this unforgettable festival with the Korean people. That was during the years when the Chinese and Korean people fought side by side against American imperialist aggression. A division commander of the Korean People's Army, Commander Park, invited us to his division headquarters to celebrate the festival. A table of rich dishes, full of local flavor, and a bottle of Korean ginseng wine, were especially rare. Commander Park was very洒脱, very talkative. From his conversation, I learned that he had participated in the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, fighting in the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines in North China. He had shed blood and been wounded for the liberation of the Chinese people. While drinking, American planes were like a swarm of annoying flies, buzzing incessantly overhead. They must have come to disturb us on purpose because it was a holiday. But Commander Park acted as if he didn't hear the planes at all, his expression unchanged, talking and laughing cheerfully. He kept raising his glass, thanking the Soviet Red Army for helping the liberation of the Korean people, thanking the Chinese People's Volunteers for their assistance in the current war, and finally raised his glass again and said:
　　"Let us pour this glass of wine to commemorate American imperialism. The path that the United States is taking now is following the same failed path that Japan took in those years. Japan's fate will inevitably be the fate of the United States. Let us drink to the death of American imperialism!"
　　As Commander Park spoke, he didn't drink, but leaned out of the shelter and splashed the glass of wine towards the sky. Then he began to sing in Chinese, singing the March of the Liberation Army. Following his singing, we also sang. Some soldiers of the People's Army couldn't sing, but they followed along. For a time, the singing was loud and clear, completely suppressing the sound of the planes overhead.
　　Looking at the People's Army's spirit full of confidence in victory, I felt warm in my heart, and I really wanted to give them a solid embrace. In the Korean people, I often find such a moving character: strong, persevering, and always holding optimistic ideals for the future. What is this character like? Later, one day, I came to the east coast of Korea, and looking at Mount Kumgang in the distance, I suddenly had an idea, and I understood: the character of the Korean people is just as upright as Mount Kumgang, just as strong, and the magnificent scenery of Mount Kumgang also symbolizes the beautiful ideals of the Korean people. No evil force can destroy Mount Kumgang, and therefore cannot destroy the ideals of the Korean people, let alone destroy this staunch and unyielding nation. In the face of such a nation, what evil force can avoid being bloodied?
　　Finally, six years ago, under the decisive blows of the Chinese and Korean people, American imperialism was forced to sign the armistice agreement.
　　The United States signed the armistice agreement, but it did not give up. Over the years, it has been thinking of tearing up the agreement and launching new aggression. It has even transported atomic weapons to South Korea, established atomic bases, threatening Korea, threatening China, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world. This is something that the Chinese and Korean people can never tolerate.
　　The pure friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged in history cannot be severed by knives or destroyed by atomic bombs. As far back as hundreds of years ago in Korea, when the Japanese invaders invaded Korea, China sent a large army to resist Japan and aid Korea, forming a close friendship with the Korean people. In the anti-American aggression and aid Korea war just a few years ago, the friendship forged between the Chinese and Korean people in blood is even more profound. What the Chinese people remember most in their hearts and will never forget is the blood and sweat that the Korean people have paid for the freedom and liberation of China, those blood and sweat will forever shine with the light of friendship in Chinese history. Today, as we celebrate the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, please remember, dear Korean comrades-in-arms, the Chinese people will always support you with all our hearts and minds. We firmly believe that in your staunch and unyielding struggle, one day you will force the American robbers to be uprooted from your southern territory, so that the hibiscus, symbolizing freedom and happiness, will bloom brightly all over that three thousand miles of beautiful land.

　　愿无穷花开满江山
　　杨朔
    古往今来，人类的历史无论如何曲折复杂，胜利最终总是属于人民的。在朝鲜人民的历史上，8月15日便是个万古不灭的胜利的标志。我们永远不能忘记朝鲜人民那种不屈不挠的斗争。当日本法西斯还像一叶铁枷架在朝鲜人民脖颈子上时，朝鲜人民经历的是怎样惨痛的生活啊。他们从来却不低头，子子孙孙，一直不断地进行着各种各样的斗争。有多少人为着祖国的自由，献出生命，有多少人抛妻舍子，远离家园，过图们江，拿起枪参加到战斗的队伍里去。这种种斗争和整个世界人民反法西斯的战斗汇合一起，形成一股不可抵御的洪流。终于在十四年前8月15日那天，斩断枷锁，获得自由，把日本法西斯埋葬到历史的底层去。
    有一次，我也曾和朝鲜人民一起度过这个难忘的节日。那还是中朝人民并肩作战，共同反对美帝国主义侵略的年月，一位朝鲜人民军的朴师长请我们到他师部去过节。一桌丰盛的菜肴，富有当地风味，一瓶朝鲜人参酒，最是难得。朴师长为人十分潇洒。又健谈。从他谈话当中，我知道他曾经参加过中国的抗日战争，转战在华北敌后抗日根据地。曾经为中国人民的解放流过血，负过伤。饮酒的当儿，美国飞机就像一群讨厌的苍蝇，粘在头顶上不停地嗡嗡着。一定因为今天是节日，才特意来扰乱。朴师长却像根本没听见飞机响，神色不动，谈笑风生。他不停地举杯，感谢苏联红军帮助朝鲜人民的解放，感谢中国志愿军对当前战争的援助，最后又举起杯说：
      “这一杯酒，让我们浇奠浇奠美帝国主义。美国现在走的路，正沿着日本当年所走的失败的道路。日本的归宿，必然也是美国的归宿。让我们为美帝国主义的死亡干杯吧！”
    朴师长说着，却不喝，探身到掩蔽部外，朝着天空泼了那杯酒。接着用中文唱起来，唱的是解放军进行曲。随着他的歌声，我们也唱起来。一些人民军战士不会唱，也随着。一时歌声昂扬，把头顶上的飞机声音完全压下去。
    我望着人民军那种充满胜利信心的气魄，心里热呼呼的，真想结结实实拥抱他们一下。在朝鲜人民身上，我经常发现这样一种动人的性格：刚强、坚忍、对未来永远抱着乐观的理想。这种性格像什么呢？后来有一天，我来到朝鲜东海岸，远远望见金刚山，心里忽然一动，我懂得了：朝鲜人民的性格正像金刚山一样挺拔，一样坚强，而金刚山那种壮丽的景色，也正象征着朝鲜人民美丽的理想，任何恶势力都不能摧毁金刚山，也就不能摧毁朝鲜人民的理想，更不能摧毁这个坚贞不屈的民族。在这样民族面前，什么恶势力，能不碰得头破血流呢？
    终于在六年前，美帝国主义在中朝人民决定性的打击下，被迫签了停战协定。
    美国签了停战协定，却并不死心。几年来，无时无刻不想撕毁协定，发动新的侵略。甚而竟往南朝鲜运来原子武器，建立原子基地，威胁朝鲜，威胁中国，威胁远东和世界的和平。这是中朝人民万万不能容忍的。
    中国和朝鲜人民在历史上凝结成的纯真友情，刀斩不断，原子弹也不能破坏。远在几百年前的朝鲜，日寇侵略朝鲜，中国就曾派遣大军，抗日援朝，跟朝鲜人民结成亲密的友谊。近在几年前，在抗美援朝战争中，中朝人民从鲜血中结成的情谊，更是山高水长。最使中国人民刻记在心，永世难忘的却是朝鲜人民为中国的自由解放所付出的血汗，那些血汗将永远在中国历史上闪射着友情的光辉。今天，当我们庆祝朝鲜解放十四周年的当儿。请记住吧，亲爱的朝鲜战友，中国人民是永远永远用整个心身支持你们的。我们深信：在你们坚强不屈的奋斗中，终有一天会迫使美国强盗从你们南部国土上连根拔走，使那象征着自由幸福的无穷花，鲜鲜亮亮地开遍那三千里锦绣江山。
