Building a Power Station Deep in the White Clouds
By our reporter Li Xinmin

　　At the end of July, during the hot season in the South, we came to the Baizhangji Hydropower Station construction site in southern Zhejiang, known for its "high water head."
　　After passing through Wencheng Town, the car meandered between the towering mountains, climbing one mountain and then advancing towards an even higher one. Everywhere we looked, there were clusters of white clouds. Sometimes the clouds filled the mountain streams, sometimes they covered the mountaintops, and sometimes mountain peaks like sharp knives appeared above the clouds. We had often seen high mountains and seas of clouds in Chinese paintings, but now we were immersed in such a realm.
　　The 21-kilometer mountain road took the car more than two hours of non-stop climbing before reaching Huangzhuang, the location of the Baizhangji Hydropower Station Engineering Office. As soon as we reached the top of the mountain, we felt a cool breeze, and compared to the sweltering heat below, it was as if we had entered a different season.
　　The Engineering Office Party Committee was located in a small building next to the construction site. Several Party Committee secretaries were either in Hangzhou for meetings or had gone down to the construction site. Comrade Hu Zemin, the head of the Propaganda Department, first led us to visit the great waterfall of Baizhangji, which is located 288 meters away from the dam. The mountain stream flows here, converging into a water head several feet wide and plunging vertically downwards, like a silver river from the sky falling into this deep mountain, with a startling roar.
　　Baizhangji is located in the middle reaches of the Da Si Creek, at an altitude of more than 600 meters. Baizhangji is composed of three sections of waterfalls: the first fall is 192 meters high, the second fall is 65 meters high, and the third fall is 18 meters high; they are one kilometer apart, and when combined with the drop in water level within this kilometer, they form a giant waterfall as high as 339 meters. Here, every 2.7 cubic meters of water can generate electricity equivalent to one kilogram of coal. Therefore, this is a good place to build a "high water head" power station.
　　Liu Zhixiang, an elderly man in Huangzhuang in his sixties, has a seven-character poem from ancient times praising Baizhangji: "The steep cliffs are startling, casting crystals from the vast sky; it does not hesitate to send flying frost even in June, and there is still angry thunder roaring in the depths of winter. The dragon pillars open in the clouds, a thousand feet white, and the sun shines with rainbow hues of five colors; if the hanging spring were to drift as rain, it could nourish crops and aid the common people." It can be seen that ancient people also wanted to utilize the water here. During the Anti-Japanese War, a department head of the Kuomintang fled to Wencheng County. He boasted that he would use the water power of Baizhangji, but because the mountain was high and the road steep, he twice turned back halfway up the mountain; the third time he hired people to carry him up, but then complained that "life on the mountain was too hard," and as a result, he silently ran away.
　　After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to utilizing the water resources here. From the day it was officially decided to build a hydropower station here, thousands of builders, treading on rocks and steep slopes, climbed to the cloud-covered mountaintop, and this quiet valley began to become noisy. At that time, there were not enough houses on the mountain, so they ate and slept outdoors. The only road connecting the foot of the mountain with the top was a narrow, steep path. There was no grain or non-staple food on the mountain, and 1,200 people carried it up every day via this path. Now, all kinds of construction materials and machines have been transported to the construction site; factory buildings, offices, dormitories, and canteens are all taking shape. The highway has also begun to be built.
　　The hydropower station is being built while being designed. According to the current plan, a reservoir with an area of 3.3 square kilometers and a storage capacity of more than 3,000 cubic meters will be built upstream of the first fall, and a regulating reservoir will also be built; a 900-meter-long water diversion tunnel with a diameter of 1.5 to 2 meters will be dug in the large stone mountain from the first fall to the third fall; a factory building will be built underground at the third fall. In addition, a road between the reservoir and the factory building will be built, and a spillway with tens of thousands of cubic meters of earthwork will be built. After the hydropower station is completed, in addition to supplying electricity for industry and agriculture, it can also relieve the flood disasters that have plagued the Wencheng Town area for years, and will also be conducive to irrigation and navigation.
　　The project is progressing rapidly. It was originally planned to generate electricity in three years, but now it seems that it can be done in about two years.
　　On the second day of our arrival at the hydropower station, we stepped on stone slab paths like ladders, passed through the first, second, and third falls, and in front of us appeared a busy construction site. The sounds of people were boiling up and down the mountain.
　　At noon, we rested in the workers' dormitory on the side of the mountain, when suddenly a message came from outside that the nearly 1,000-meter water diversion tunnel had been completely opened at just after 11 o'clock today. This was really a great event on the construction site! The mountain was high and the rock was hard, and the designed slope of the water diversion channel was large, the line was quite long, and the limitations of technical conditions and equipment brought great difficulties to the workers. But in the past few months, the workers have been digging from top to bottom, from bottom to top, and from the middle, sinking vertical and inclined shafts, advancing in several directions, overcoming difficulties one by one with hard work and ingenuity. Today was the fourth meeting in the cave, the last meeting, how could people not be happy!
　　In the struggle to open the water diversion tunnel, many heroes emerged. In the dormitory, we met a young pneumatic drill operator, Sun Shoujiao, who was tall and knew at a glance that he was not a careless person. It is understood that he could use a pneumatic drill weighing dozens of pounds freely, so whether he was drilling upwards or downwards, he could do it quickly and well. But this is not the whole picture; he also knew how to use his brain. In the past, a working face required 18 to 20 blasting holes. He and his team members pondered several times and made appropriate adjustments to the position of the blasting holes and the direction of the pneumatic drill, reducing the number of holes by several at once. In this way, efficiency was greatly improved, and a lot of explosives were saved.
　　In this dormitory, we also interviewed Communist Party member Huang Yanqian. He was a demobilized soldier, and as soon as he came back, he led more than forty fellow villagers to climb Baizhangji. His work was to dig a 25-meter vertical shaft between two mountains, and then excavate the water diversion tunnel to both sides. It was the rainy season, and the mountain streams were all pouring into the well, which was very unfavorable for excavation work, but how to solve this problem! After several deliberations, Huang Yanqian finally came up with a "pipeline diversion method," in which the water flowing to the working face was immediately transported out through pipelines, solving this problem. Not long ago, they solved another difficulty. As the well deepened, the efficiency of transporting the mined rock to the outside became very low and unsafe. Huang Yanqian consulted with people everywhere, thinking about developing a new tool while eating and sleeping. As a result, a wooden soil hoisting machine appeared, increasing work efficiency three times and saving more than 30,000 man-days in four months.
　　The digging of this water diversion tunnel was carried out simultaneously in several places. How to make these sections of tunnels connect with each other? This should be directed by an experienced engineer. However, we met several young surveying staff, and it was they who connected the entire line according to the plan, with an error of only a few centimeters. In order to complete the task well, they put in a lot of thought and hard physical labor. They originally wanted to create a dotted line parallel to the water diversion tunnel on this mountain, but the mountain was high and steep, and it was impossible to measure it accurately, so they ran all over the surrounding high mountains to determine the various points on this dotted line from the side mountains. In the water diversion tunnel, they appeared in the smoke-filled aftermath after each blast. In order to continuously correct the blasting direction, sometimes, because there were many blasting faces and the instruments were not enough, they came up with many local surveying methods, a few ropes could replace the instruments in certain situations, and the large stone balls from the farmers' homes were also used to replace the hammer balls.
　　That afternoon, we climbed to the top of the mountain again and went down into the water diversion tunnel through a vertical shaft. The workers were busy with the pouring work, the small cement trucks were shuttling back and forth like shuttles, and a large number of steel bars were also sent into the tunnel. Outside the tunnel entrance, there were crowds of people carrying materials everywhere. Gao Yongqian, the secretary of the Party branch of the pouring brigade, pointed to a big man in the crowd and said to us: "Lin Sanpao, the famous strongman, can carry 400 pounds. Many troupe comrades come here to perform and also want to visit him." We saw a large bag of cement pressed on his shoulder, and he was walking like the wind. Later, someone told us a story about him: Once, he carried ten large wooden boards by himself, which was already very heavy, but on the way, he insisted that others share a wooden board for him to carry. The man said, "Lao Lin, where do you get so much strength?" He said, "Strength is made by using it, it depends on whether you are willing to use it." This sentence really explained why he became a strongman, on the one hand, he was strong and healthy, and on the other hand, he had enough enthusiasm.
　　Back at the Engineering Office guest house, night had fallen, lights were twinkling on the top of the mountain, and the sounds of cars and explosions were mixed together. At this time, the day shift at the construction site was over, and the night shift had begun. (Attached picture)

　　白云深处建电站
　　本报记者　李新民
    7月末，正当南方的炎热季节，我们来到浙江南部以“高水头”闻名的百丈漈水电站工地。
    过了文成镇，汽车便迂回在丛山峻岭之间，爬上一个山头，又向更高的山头前进。到处看到一团团的白云。有时云满山涧，有时云盖山头，有时云的上面又出现了像尖刀一样的山峰。我们经常从国画中看到过高山云海，现在却置身在这种境界中了。
    二十一公里的上山公路，汽车不停地爬了两个多小时，然后到达篁庄，这就是百丈漈水电站工程处的所在地。一上山，便感到天气凉爽，和山下的炎热情景比起来，这里好像是换了一个季节。
    工程处党委设在工地旁边一幢小楼房里，几个党委书记，有的上杭州开会去了，有的下了工地。宣传部部长胡泽民同志首先领我们去参观百丈漈的大瀑布，这瀑布就在大坝旁边二百八十八米处。山上的溪水流到这里，汇成几丈宽的水头垂直下泻，像天上的银河落在这深山中，响声惊人。
    百丈漈在大泗溪的中游，海拔六百多米。百丈漈是由三段瀑布构成的，头漈一百九十二米高，二漈六十五米高，三漈十八米高；前后相距一公里，再加上在这一公里间的流水落差，就构成了高达三百三十九米的巨瀑。在这里，每二点七立方的水量，可以产生相当于一公斤煤所产生的电力。因此，这是一个建立“高水头”电站的好地方。
    篁庄有一位六十多岁的老人刘致祥，藏有一首古人咏百丈漈的七言律诗：“巉岩峭壁使人惊，万斛长空抛水晶；六月不辞飞霜冷，三冬还有怒雷鸣。云开龙柱千寻白，日照虹拖五色明；若令悬泉飘作雨，堪滋禾稼济苍生。”可知古人也想把这里的水利用起来。在抗日战争时期，国民党的一个厅长逃难到文成县，当时曾夸口说要使用百丈漈的水力，因为山高路陡，两次登山都中途折返；第三次雇人抬了上来，却又怪山上“生活太苦”，结果就无声无息地逃跑了。
    解放以后，党和政府十分重视利用这里的水力资源，自从正式决定在这里兴建水电站的那一天起，数以千计的建设者踏着乱石和陡坡，爬上白云弥漫的山顶，这个幽静的峡谷，便开始喧闹起来了。那时候，山上房子不够，他们露天吃饭和露天睡觉。连接山下和山上的道路，只有一条笔陡的羊肠小道。山上没有粮食和副食品，每天有一千二百人通过这条小道、肩挑人背地弄上来。现在，在这里，各种各样的建筑器材和机器已经运送到了施工地点；厂房、办公室、宿舍、食堂都已经有了一个规模。公路也开始修筑了。
    水电站是在边设计边施工中进行的。按照现在的计划，在头漈的上游，要造一个面积三点三平方公里蓄水三千多立方米的水库，另外还要造一个调节性的水库；从头漈到三漈的大石头山中，要凿一条直径一米半到两米、长达九百多米的引水隧道；在三漈的地下，建立起厂房。除此之外，还要建造水库和厂房之间的公路，要造一条有数十万土方的溢洪道。这个水电站建成后，除供应工农业用电外，还可解除文城镇一带历年来的洪水灾害，并有利于灌溉和航运。
    工程进展很快。原来计划三年发电的，现在看来，两年左右就可以了。
    我们来到这个水电站的第二天，就踏着像梯子一样的石板小路，经过头漈二漈和三漈，面前出现了一片繁忙的建筑工地。山上山下人声沸腾。
    中午，我们在山边的工人宿舍里休息，突然外边传来了一个消息，近一千米的引水隧道已在今天十一点多钟全部凿通。这真是工地上的一件大喜事！山高岩硬，而设计的引水道坡度又大，线路相当长，加上技术条件和设备条件的限制，曾经给职工们带来了很大的困难。可是这几个月来，工人们从上向下打，从下向上打，又从中间打竖井和斜井进去，分头向两头打，几路进军，凭着干劲和巧劲，困难一个个地被克服了。今天是第四次洞中会师，是最后一次会师，人们心里怎么不乐哩！
    在打通引水隧道的斗争中，出现了很多英雄好汉。我们在宿舍里碰到了一个年轻的风钻手孙寿教，此人身材高大，一眼就知道他不是个马虎人。据了解，几十斤的风钻他运用自如，因而打起眼来不管是向上打或者向下打，他都做到又快又好。可是这还不全面，他又会动脑筋，过去一个工作面要打十八个到二十个爆破眼，他和班上的人琢磨了几次，把爆破眼的位置和风钻打眼的方向作了适当调整，一下子减少了好几个眼。这样，效率大大提高了，还节省了不少炸药。
    在这个宿舍里，我们还访问了共产党员黄岩钱。他是一个复原军人，一回来，就带领着四十多个同乡爬上了百丈漈。他的工作地点，是负责在两山之间打一个二十五米的直井下去，然后再向两侧挖掘引水隧道。当时是雨季，山间的流水都灌到井里来了，这对开挖工作是十分不利的，可是这个难题如何解决哩！黄岩钱经过几番琢磨，终于想出了个“接管流水法”，水流到工作面就马上被管道输送出去，解决了这道难题。不久前，他们又解决了另一个困难。由于井深了，开采出来的岩石运到外边来效率很低，而且不安全。黄岩钱又到处和人商量，吃饭睡觉都在想搞个新工具出来。结果，一架木质吊土机出现了，工作效率提高三倍，在四个月内节约了三万多个人工。
    打这个引水隧道，是好几处同时进行的，怎样使这些一段一段的隧道互相接起头来？这应该由富有经验的工程师来指挥了。可是，我们所会到的却是几个年轻的测量工作人员，就是他们，把全线按照计划接通了，误差只有几公分。他们为了很好地完成任务，付出了多少心思和艰苦的体力劳动。他们原想在这个山头上弄一根和引水隧道并行的虚线来，可是山高且陡，无法准确地测量出来，于是他们就跑遍了四周的高山，从旁的山上来确定这根虚线上的各个点。在引水隧道里，每次爆破之后，在硝烟弥漫中，他们出现了。为了继续不断地校正爆破方向，有时候，由于爆破工作面很多，仪器不够，他们就想出了许多测量的土办法来，几根绳子也能在一定情况下代替仪器，农民家里的大石球也用来代替了锤球。
    这天下午，我们又登上了山顶，并从一个竖井下到引水隧道里。工人们正在忙着进行浇捣工作，运水泥的小斗车像梭子一样来往不停，大量的钢筋也送入洞内，出了洞口，到处都是搬运材料的人群。浇捣大队的党支部书记高永乾指着人流中一个大个子对我们说：“林三炮，闻名的大力士，能挑四百斤，不少剧团的同志到这里来演出也要访问访问他呢。”我们看，一大包水泥压在他的肩上，而他却健步如飞，后来有人给我们讲了关于他的一个故事：有一次，他一个人扛了十块大木板，已经很重了，在途中，却硬要别人再分一块木板给他扛。那人说：“老林，你那来这么大力气？”他说：“力是使出来的，看你愿不愿使。”他这句话确实说出了他所以成为大力士的原因，一方面是身强体壮，另一方面是干劲足。
    回到工程处招待所，夜已经降临，山顶上闪烁着灯光，汽车声，爆破声混和在一起。这时候，工地上白班已经下班，夜班又开始了。（附图片）
