Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 18th: The news of the upcoming mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet and American governments has inspired the people of all countries, including the American people, with the desire to ease international tensions. However, certain political figures in the United States and newspapers reflecting the views of powerful groups are worried that international relations will improve. They are vigorously propagating that the "Cold War" will not thaw, and the "position of strength" policy pursued by the United States will remain unchanged.

The August 17th issue of "Newsweek" reflected the anxiety of many influential people in the United States who actively advocate the "Cold War" policy about the easing of the situation. The magazine said, "The biggest unease in Washington is that Khrushchev's visit will induce Americans to develop an unfounded sense of security. The United States believes that nothing will really change - although tensions may ease somewhat, the Cold War will remain as cold as ever. And this means that defense (military) efforts must not be interrupted."

The magazine also said, "In the coming weeks, government officials, cabinet members, and members of Congress will make this clear to the people." And the situation is now developing in the direction shown by this major American business newspaper. American officials have recently come out one after another to emphasize that the United States will continue to pursue the "Cold War" policy, and are trying to downplay the significance of the upcoming mutual visits between the Soviet and American leaders. U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon said that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower "do not mean any change in our basic policy." Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons clamored that "now is the time to maintain the strength of ourselves and our allies; any sign of weakness at present is not only unjustified, but also useless."

Some members of Congress also made hysterical noises. Democratic Senator Dodd said that the mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet and American governments "mark one of the darkest days in American history," and said that although he was powerless to stop the mutual visits, he hoped to "limit the extent of Khrushchev's victory." House Democratic Leader McCormack, Chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee Walter, Senators Engle and Byrd, and others also expressed their opposition to the mutual visits in the same way, trying to pour cold water on the heartfelt desire of the American people that the mutual visits between the Soviet and American leaders will achieve positive results.

The American "Cold War" defenders are also worried that the mutual visits between the Soviet and American leaders will affect their efforts to drive the United States' "allies" to expand their armaments and prepare for war. "New York Times" reporter William Jordan wrote on this issue that although some American decision-makers believe that the mutual visits have "some possible benefits" for the United States, such as "delaying the possibility of a (Berlin) crisis for at least a few months," they also believe that "the current American strategy has several unfavorable aspects. One of them is that some governments will regard this decision as an American retreat and a victory for Khrushchev's long-term pursuit. At the same time, it makes it difficult for governments friendly to the United States to maintain a positive anti-communist policy at home, because local newspapers are publishing pictures of the world's highest-ranking communist in the White House and the American president in the Kremlin. In addition, there are also concerns that the sentiment that the world will be all right will increase, and in this way, those governments that have developed their military forces according to the past requirements and recommendations of the United States will find it difficult to defend their (military) plans to their people and parliament."

Associated Press reporter McGee, in analyzing the recent sharp drop in the New York stock market, said that stockbrokers said that the announcement of the mutual visits created a "peace fear mentality" among investors, who feared that "any easing of international tensions might cut defense (military) spending."

The August 17th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine summarized the thinking of American stubborn forces with these words: "The 'Cold War' will not end suddenly. Arms spending will not decrease in the foreseeable future. American overseas bases will not be abandoned. The development of weapons will continue in the future as it has in the past." But, despite this, as many American bourgeois newspapers have had to admit, the United States will encounter greater difficulties and failures in continuing to implement this policy.

### 美国“冷战”鼓吹者害怕解冻　竭力给苏美领导人相互访问泼冷水

　　美国“冷战”鼓吹者害怕解冻
　　竭力给苏美领导人相互访问泼冷水
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：苏美两国政府领导人即将相互访问的消息鼓舞了各国人民、包括美国人民在内对于缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，但是美国某些政界人士和反映有势力集团观点的报刊却担心国际关系会得到改善，它们正竭力宣传“冷战”不会解冻，美国推行的
  “实力地位”政策仍将不变。8月17日一期的“新闻周刊”反映了积极鼓吹“冷战”政策的美国许多有势力人士对局势和缓的忧虑。这家周刊说，“华盛顿感到的最大不安是，赫鲁晓夫的访问会诱使美国人产生一种没有根据的安全感。美国认为，任何事情都不会发生真正的变化——虽然紧张局势可能缓和一些，但是冷战将依然冰冷如故。而这就意味着，防务（军事）努力决不能中断。”
    这家杂志还说，“在今后几周，政府官员、内阁官员、国会议员都将把这一点向人民讲清楚。”而事态现在也确是像美国这家大企业报刊所显示的方向发展。美国官员最近已接二连三地出来强调美国要继续推行“冷战”政策，并且竭力企图贬低苏美两国领导人即将互访的意义。美国副国务卿狄龙说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问“并不意味着我们的基本政策有了任何改变。”负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯叫嚷说，“现在是维持我们自己和我们的盟友的实力的时候；目前任何软弱的表现不但是不正当的，而且也是无益的。”
    一些国会议员也发出歇斯底里的吵嚷。民主党参议员多德说苏美两国政府领导人互访“标志着美国历史上最黑暗的日子之一”，并且说他虽然无力阻止这个互访，但是却希望“限制赫鲁晓夫胜利的程度”。众议院民主党领袖麦考马克、众议院非美活动调查委员会主席华尔特、参议员恩格尔和伯德等人也同样地表示反对互访，竭力给美国人民衷心期望苏美领导人的互访将取得积极成果的心愿泼冷水。
    美国的“冷战”卫士还担心苏美领导人的互访，将会影响他们驱策美国的“盟国”扩军备战的努力。“纽约时报”记者威廉·约旦就这个问题写道，美国一些决策人虽然认为互访对美国“有一些可能的好处”，例如“把（柏林）危机爆发的可能性最少拖延几个月”，但是他们同时也认为“美国现行的策略具有若干不利的方面。其中一个是一些政府会把这个决定看作是美国的退却和赫鲁晓夫长期争取的胜利。同时还使那些同美国友好的政府难于在国内维持一个积极的反共的政策，因为当地报纸都在刊载世界最高级的共产党人在白宫和美国总统在克里姆林宫的图片。此外，也有人担心，认为世界将各事如意的情绪会增长，而这一来，那些根据美国过去的要求和建议来发展它们的军事力量的政府，将难于向它们的人民和议会替它们的（军事）计划辩护了。”
    美联社记者麦基在分析纽约股票行市最近的暴跌时说，股票经纪人说，宣布相互访问的消息在投资人中间造成了“和平恐惧心理”，他们担心“国际紧张局势的任何缓和都可能削减国防（军事）费用”。
    8月17日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志用这样的话来概括美国顽固势力的想法：“‘冷战’不会突然结束。军备开支在可以预见的将来不会减少。美国的海外基地不会放弃。武器的发展正如过去一样，今后也将继续下去。”但是，尽管如此，正如美国许多资产阶级报刊也不得不承认的，美国在继续执行这种政策时将会遭到更大的困难和失败。
