Notes

    Japan's "Super Salesman"
    Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi recently toured various countries, visiting eleven countries in Europe and South America, and has now returned home. The Japanese Prime Minister was in high spirits, traveling abroad for a whole month. What was the purpose of this trip, which is quite intriguing?
    The August 4th issue of New York's "Newsweek" revealed Nobusuke Kishi's mission, which was to act as "Japan's super salesman" with the aim of "finding new markets" for Japan. This makes sense. Nobusuke Kishi, bearing the title of "super salesman," visited some old-brand imperialist countries in Western Europe, attempting to use his eloquent tongue to win a share of the capitalist market scraps for Japanese monopoly capital.
    However, things did not go as planned. The capitalist banquet was already a case of "more monks than gruel." Nobusuke Kishi, the "salesman," could only brazenly squeeze into the seats in Britain, West Germany, and elsewhere. Such a "salesman" was naturally unwelcome. Therefore, although Nobusuke Kishi went with great enthusiasm, he had to return disappointed. A Japanese radio commentator, Takamoto Hosokawa, also provided a final assessment of Nobusuke Kishi's trip abroad, saying it was very "regrettable." Specifically, Nobusuke Kishi "gained nothing," that's all.

    日本的“超级推销员”
    日本首相岸信介最近周游列国，到欧洲和南美十一个国家去访问，现在已经回国。这位日本首相兴致勃勃，出国逛了整整一个月，究竟所为何来，颇可寻味。
    8月4日的纽约“新闻周刊”道出了岸信介的任务，原来他是去充当“日本的超级推销员”的目的是要为日本“寻找新市场”。这就可以理解了，岸信介领着这个“超级推销员”的头衔，到西欧一些老牌的帝国主义国家登门拜访，企图凭他三寸不烂之舌，替日本垄断资本争得一杯资本主义市场的残羹。
    但是，事与愿违。在那资本主义的宴席上早已经是“僧多粥少”，岸信介这个“推销员”只能厚着脸皮硬往英国、西德和其他座位上死挤。这样的“推销员”当然不受欢迎，因此岸信介虽然乘兴而往，却不得不败兴而归。日本的一个电台评论员细川隆元也替岸信介的这次出国之行来个盖棺论定，说是非常“遗憾”，具体看来，岸信介“一无所得”，如此而已。
