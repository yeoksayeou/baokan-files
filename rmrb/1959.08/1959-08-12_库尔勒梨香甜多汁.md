Korla Pear: Fragrant, Sweet, and Juicy

The famous Korla fragrant pear is growing very well this year. It is estimated that the yield may increase by five or six times compared to last year.

Korla fragrant pears have won people's praise for their thin skin, tender flesh, fragrance, sweetness, and juiciness. Before liberation, the vast majority of people did not have enough food and clothing, so there was no talk of managing fragrant pears. In 1949, the total pear orchard area was only 38 mu. In the past ten years, it has developed more than tenfold. Especially since the communization last year, the county, communes, brigades, and teams have all paid attention to the planting and management of pear trees. Now the county has 10,570 pear trees, covering an area of 454 mu.

In order to make the fragrant pears grow well and produce more fruit, the county and various communes have taken many measures this year. This spring, the county held a horticulture training class, gathering commune cadres in charge of horticulture and experienced old farmers for short-term study. Subsequently, each commune established specialized fruit tree management teams to carry out a campaign to eliminate various pests; additional fertilizer was applied, more weeding was done, and frequent watering was carried out. These measures have never been taken before. Now, each tree bears about 1,000 pears. The twelve pear trees cultivated by the Henan Brigade of the Xikeqi Commune bear more than 3,000 pears each.

### 库尔勒梨香甜多汁

　　库尔勒梨香甜多汁
    有名的库尔勒香梨，今年长得很好。据估计，产量可能比去年增加五、六倍。
    库尔勒的香梨，以皮薄、肉嫩、香甜多汁等特点赢得了人们的赞扬。解放前，由于广大人民衣食尚且不全，谈不到对香梨的经营管理。一九四九年，全部梨树只有三十八亩，十年来已发展了十几倍，尤其是去年公社化以后，从县到公社、大队、小队都重视了对梨树的栽植和管理。现在全县已经有一万零五百七十棵梨树，占地四百五十四亩。
    为了使香梨长的好，结果多，县和各公社今年采取了许多措施。今年春天，县里开办了园艺训练班，召集公社负责园艺的干部和有经验的老农短期学习。接着，各公社都成立了果树管理专业队，开展了消灭各种害虫运动；加施追肥、多锄草、勤浇水。这些措施是从来不曾有过的。现在，每棵树结梨在一千个左右，铣克其公社河南大队培育的十二棵梨树，每棵结梨在三千个以上。
