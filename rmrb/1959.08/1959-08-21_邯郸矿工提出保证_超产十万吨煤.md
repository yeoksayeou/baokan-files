    邯郸 Miners Pledge to Guarantee
    Overproduction of 100,000 Tons of Coal
    After our Handan Mining Bureau employees earnestly studied the editorial "Overcome Right-leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," the mine leadership conducted a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the current situation. Everyone is highly motivated and full of energy. In order to produce more coal to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day, we would like to propose a friendly initiative to fraternal mines across the country to engage in a fierce battle during August and September: (1) Guarantee to over fulfill the state's third quarter coal production plan six days ahead of schedule in a balanced manner, and overproduce 100,000 tons of coal for the whole year; (2) Guarantee to reduce costs by 8%; (3) Increase overall efficiency by 11%; (4) Reduce the raw coal impurity rate by 0.5%; (5) Reduce pit wood consumption by 15% compared to the state target; (6) Achieve an attendance rate of over 92%; (7) Do a good job in preparation to ensure coal availability for more than six months. The measures to be taken are: put politics in command, mobilize the masses to beat the drums for high-yield, high-speed, large-area, bumper-harvest red banner competition; strengthen the leadership of the Party, vigorously grasp enterprise management, and establish and improve various rules and regulations; vigorously carry out technical innovation and promote the effective experience of three-shift mixed operations and four-shift cross operations; in addition, with the development of production, take important measures such as reasonably adjusting labor organization, making full use of working hours, paying attention to safe production, and strengthening equipment repairs to ensure normal production.
                            Respectfully, All Employees of Handan Mining Bureau, August 12th

    邯郸矿工提出保证
    超产十万吨煤
    我们邯郸矿务局职工认真学习“克服右倾情绪厉行增产节约”的社论后，紧接着矿的领导对当前形势作了全面系统的分析，大家斗志昂扬，干劲十足。为了多产煤迎接国庆十周年，我们愿向全国各兄弟矿提出鏖战8、9月份的友谊倡议：（一）保证提前六天均衡地、超额完成国家第三季度产煤计划，全年超产十万吨煤；（二）保证降低成本8％，（三）提高全员效率11％；（四）降低原煤含碴率0.5％；（五）坑木消耗比国家指标降低15％；（六）出勤率达到92％以上；（七）做好准备工作保证获得煤量达到六个月以上。采取的措施是：政治挂帅，发动群众擂起高产高速大面积丰产红旗竞赛的战鼓；加强党的领导大抓企业管理，建立健全各项规章制度；大闹技术革新，推广行之有效的三班混合作业和四班交叉作业经验等；另外随着生产的发展，采取合理调整劳动组织、充分利用工时、注意安全生产、加强设备修理等保证正常生产的重要措施。
                            邯郸矿务局全体职工敬上　8月12日
