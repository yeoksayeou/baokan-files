Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: Since pine resin tapping entered its peak season, the number of people going to the mountains to collect resin has surged since July. According to statistics from Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Sichuan and other five provinces and autonomous regions, the number of people currently collecting resin in the mountains has increased by nearly double compared to the end of June. In Jiangxi Province, another major production area, the number of people collecting resin in the mountains has increased to around 10,000. Heilongjiang Province, rich in pine resin resources, has also launched extensive resin collection activities this year, and the province now has more than 7,000 professional and part-time resin collection workers. In order to seize the peak season to collect enough pine resin and increase the production of rosin and turpentine, the number of people going to the mountains in various major production areas is still increasing.

With the increase in the number of people going to the mountains, the amount of pine resin collected has greatly increased, and the output of rosin and turpentine is steadily increasing. Taking Guangdong Province, one of the old production areas, as an example, the rosin output in less than a month in July is equal to 75% of the cumulative output by the end of June. The output of other provinces and autonomous regions has also increased to varying degrees since July.

Tapping pine resin is an important sideline for people's communes in mountainous areas. The rosin and turpentine refined from pine resin are indispensable raw materials for many industrial sectors. Therefore, the local Party committees attach great importance to organizing this production. In addition to emphasizing the great significance of increasing rosin production at the industrial secretaries' meeting held in early July, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee also held a special timber and rosin production meeting to make specific arrangements. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee made comprehensive arrangements for the resin tapping labor force, requiring the province to rapidly increase the mountain teams to 18,000 people. In Nanchuan County, Sichuan Province, which is rich in pine resin, the county Party committee took five measures to ensure the completion of this year's pine resin tapping plan, requiring Party committees at all levels in the county to appoint a secretary to lead this work, so that the vast number of cadres and the masses can understand the importance of collecting pine resin for supporting national construction and increasing the income of people's communes and commune members, and also stipulated the resin tapping quota and bonus system for over-fulfillment.

All localities also paid special attention to technical guidance for resin tapping, and did everything possible to improve work efficiency. Heilongjiang Province, a new production area, held a rosin production on-site meeting to exchange more than 20 mature experiences in refining rosin and tapping resin. Guanyang County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region held resin tapping farmer meetings in people's communes to summarize experience and launch competitions. The resin tapping efficiency has generally increased from 300 trees tapped per day to 350 trees or even 500 trees. The Party Secretary of the Zhongzhou People's Commune in Huaiji County, Guangdong Province, went to the mountains with commune members to study and improve resin tapping techniques, increasing the amount of resin tapped per person per day from more than 20 jin to more than 40 jin.

Since the production of rosin and turpentine has been included in the national plan this year, the State Planning Commission recently jointly held a national rosin production area meeting with the Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Commerce, which are in charge of production and procurement respectively. The main production areas reported their situation, requiring all localities to seize the peak season of resin tapping, allocate sufficient resin tapping labor, strengthen the organization of resin tapping professional teams, improve work efficiency in all aspects, ensure the completion of the production plan, and strive to over-fulfill the plan.

### 支援国家建设　增加公社收入　千百万人上山大采松脂　领导加强　工效提高　产量大增

　　支援国家建设　增加公社收入
　　千百万人上山大采松脂
　　领导加强　工效提高　产量大增
    新华社10日讯　松脂采割进入旺季以来，从7月份起上山采脂人数较前激增。据广东、广西、福建、湖南、四川等五省和自治区的统计，目前上山采脂的人数比6月底增加将近一倍。另一主要产区的江西省，上山采脂人数已增加到万人左右。松脂资源丰富的黑龙江省，今年也展开了广泛的采脂活动，全省现在已有专业和兼职的采脂工人七千多名。为了抓紧在旺季采集足够的松脂，增产松香和松节油，各主要产区上山人数仍在陆续增加。
    随着上山人数加多，松脂采集量大增，松香、松节油的产量正稳步上升。以老产区之一的广东省为例，7月不到一个月的松香产量，已等于到6月底为止的累计产量的75％。其他各省、自治区的产量，从7月份起也有不同程度的增加。
    采割松脂是山区人民公社的一项重要副业，松脂提炼的松香、松节油是许多工业部门必不可少的原料。因此各地党委对组织这项生产都十分重视。中共广东省委除在7月初召开的工业书记会议上强调了增产松香的重大意义外，又专门召开了木材、松香生产会议，作了具体部署。中共江西省委对采脂的劳力作了全面安排，要求全省把上山队伍迅速增加到一万八千人。在盛产松脂的四川省南川县，县委采取了五项措施来保证今年松脂采割计划的完成，要求全县各级党委都要确定一个书记领导这一工作，使广大干部和群众都能认识采割松脂对支援国家建设、增加人民公社及社员收入的重要意义，并且规定了采脂定额和超额奖励制度。
    各地还特别重视了采脂技术指导，千方百计提高工效。新产区的黑龙江省曾经举行松香生产现场会议，交流了炼制松香和采脂的二十多项成熟经验。广西僮族自治区灌阳县以人民公社为单位，召开采脂农民会议，总结经验，展开评比，采脂效率一般已由每天采割三百株提高到三百五十株甚至五百株。广东省怀集县中洲人民公社党委书记和社员一起上山，研究和改进采脂技术，使每人每天采脂量从二十多斤提高到四十多斤。
    由于松香、松节油的生产从今年起已列入国家计划，国家计划委员会最近和主管生产的林业部和主管收购的商业部联合召开了全国松香产区的会议，由主要产区作了汇报，要求各地抓紧采脂旺季，配足采脂劳力，加强采脂专业队的组织，从各方面提高工效，保证完成生产计划，并且力争超产。
