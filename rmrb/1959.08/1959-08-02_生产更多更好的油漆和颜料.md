    A Short Commentary:
    Producing more and better paints and pigments
    Paints and pigments are quite important industrial products. Without them, some construction projects cannot be installed, completed, and put into production in a timely manner, and some light and heavy industrial products cannot be shipped from the factory on time.
    In recent years, China's paint industry has developed rapidly. Last year, the national paint output increased by 170% compared with 1957, equivalent to ten times that of 1949. More than 400 new varieties have been successfully trial-produced by paint factories across the country. However, with the rapid development of national construction, the demand for paint is increasing day by day. In order to meet this need, the paint and pigment sector must strive to increase production.
    Increasing the production of paints and pigments is not only a matter for the chemical industry sector. There are many types of raw materials used in the manufacture of paints and pigments (approximately 400 types). In addition to phthalic anhydride, pentaerythritol, phenol, formaldehyde, alcohol solvents, etc., which are produced by the chemical industry sector, a large part of other raw materials such as rosin, turpentine, linseed oil, tung oil, catalpa oil, and glycerin come from agriculture, forestry, grain and light industry departments. Some metal raw materials such as lead and zinc rely on the supply from the metallurgical sector. Therefore, to solve the problem of the supply of raw materials for paints and pigments, relevant departments must cooperate closely and work together.
    How to solve the problem of raw materials for paints and pigments? We should simultaneously emphasize both opening up new sources and reducing expenditure. While increasing the production of raw materials, paint and pigment factories should adopt a self-reliant approach and produce some raw materials themselves. For example, some paint factories use indigenous methods to produce raw materials such as phthalic anhydride, sodium dichromate, yellow prussiate of soda, butanol, and acetone to meet production needs. In terms of raw material usage, we must pay attention to saving, substitution, and recycling as much as possible, and reduce raw material consumption. In terms of substitution, we can further study the use of wild plant oils, marine fish oils, and other oils to replace drying and semi-drying oils. In the production process of paints and lacquers, we can consider recycling solvent thinners, resin wastewater, sublimated phthalic anhydride, and waste oil sludge for reuse. Waste liquids and materials from metallurgical, mechanical, and chemical factories, such as zinc slag, iron filings, and waste acid, can also be used to manufacture inorganic pigments. Paint production and user units should vigorously promote the use of hot spraying to save paint solvents and thinners. The task of paint research institutions and paint and pigment factory laboratories is to actively research and trial-produce new varieties that use less or no solvents and vegetable oils, such as solvent-free coatings, water-emulsified paints, and new resinous paints, and further reduce the consumption quota of non-ferrous metals such as lead, zinc, titanium, and chromium.
    While vigorously increasing the production of paint, we must also pay close attention to improving product quality and increasing high-grade varieties. In the past period, some factories relaxed the inspection of product quality, causing the quality of some paints to decline. Therefore, all paint and pigment factories must strictly implement operating procedures, improve the qualified rate of products, and prevent unqualified products from leaving the factory.
    Recently, various paint and pigment factories and research institutions have paid attention to the trial production and production of high-grade paints. Many new high-grade products have been applied to aircraft, automobiles, ships, motors, and various machines manufactured in our country. However, the rapid development of national construction has also placed higher demands on paint varieties, requiring the production of high-temperature resistance, high-strength electrical insulating paints, high-grade automotive paints, high-grade anti-fouling paints, and various high-grade anti-rust paints, etc., to meet the needs of the industrial sector. This is a glorious task placed in front of paint and pigment factories and research institutions. At the same time, further trial production of various new types of paint resins and pigments to adapt to the development of high-grade paints is also an important topic for production units and research institutions.
    As long as all relevant departments and production units, and all paint and pigment research institutions, continue to exert their efforts, vigorously break through the raw material barrier, improve product quality, and further expand high-grade varieties, we will surely be able to produce more and better paints and pigments!

    生产更多更好的油漆和颜料
    油漆和颜料，是相当重要的工业产品。没有它们，一些建设工程就不能及时安装、收尾、投入生产，一些轻重工业产品也不能及时出厂。
    近几年，我国油漆工业发展很快。去年，全国油漆产量比1957年增长170％，相当于1949年的十倍。全国油漆厂试制成功的新品种有四百多种。但是，随着国家建设的迅速发展，对油漆的需要数量日益增多。为了满足这种需要，油漆颜料部门必须努力增加生产。
    油漆和颜料的增产，不仅是化学工业部门的事情。制造油漆颜料使用的原料品种较多（约有四百多种），这些原料除了苯二甲酸酐、季戊四醇、苯酚、甲醛、醇类溶剂等，是由化学工业部门生产以外，其他很大一部分原料如松香、松节油、亚麻仁油、桐油、梓油、甘油等，都是来自农业、林业、粮食和轻工业等部门，有些金属铅、锌原料要依靠冶金部门供应。因此，解决油漆颜料原料的供应问题，必须各有关部门密切协作，共同努力。
    怎样解决油漆颜料的原料问题？应当是开源节流同时并重。在增产原料的同时，油漆颜料厂应该采取自力更生的办法，生产一部分原料，如有些油漆厂用土法生产出苯二甲酸酐、重铬酸钠、黄血盐、丁醇和丙铜等原料，供应了生产的需要。在原料使用方面，要尽量注意节约、代用和回收，并且降低原料消耗。在代用方面，可以进一步研究利用野生植物油、海鱼油等油脂，代替干性油和半干性油。在油漆、喷漆的生产过程中，可以考虑回收溶剂稀料、树脂废水、升华的苯二甲酸酐、废油脚，重新使用。还可以用冶金、机械和化学工厂的废液、废料如锌渣、铁屑和废酸，制造无机颜料。喷漆生产和使用单位，应该大力推广使用热喷漆，以节约油漆溶剂和稀料。油漆研究机关和油漆颜料厂试验室的任务是：积极研究试制少用或不用溶剂和植物油的新品种，如无溶剂涂料、水乳化漆和新型树脂化漆，并进一步降低铅、锌、钛、铬等有色金属的消耗定额。
    大力增产油漆的同时，还要十分注意提高产品质量，增加高级品种。过去一个时期，有的工厂由于放松了对产品质量的检查，使某些油漆质量下降。因此，各油漆颜料厂必须严格执行操作规程，提高产品的合格率，不让那些不合格的产品出厂。
    最近，各油漆颜料工厂和研究机关，已经注意了高级油漆的试制和生产，许多新的高级产品已经应用到我国自己制造的飞机、汽车、轮船、电机和各种机器上面。但是，国家建设飞跃发展，对油漆品种也提出了更高的要求，要求生产耐高温、耐高强度的电绝缘漆、高级汽车漆、高级船底漆和各种高级防锈漆等等，以满足工业部门的需要。这是摆在油漆颜料工厂和研究机关面前的一项光荣任务。与此同时，进一步试制生产各种新型的漆用树脂和颜料，适应高级油漆的发展，也是生产单位和研究机关当前的一个重要课题。
    只要各有关部门和生产单位，各油漆和颜料的研究机关，继续鼓足干劲，大力突破原料关，提高产品质量，进一步扩大高级品种，就一定能够生产出又多又好的油漆和颜料！
