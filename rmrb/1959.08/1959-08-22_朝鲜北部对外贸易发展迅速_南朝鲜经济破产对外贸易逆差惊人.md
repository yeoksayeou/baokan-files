Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency in Pyongyang on the 20th, the latest issue of the monthly magazine "Korea Today" published an article by Li Chang-chun, Deputy Minister of Trade of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which reviewed the development of Korea's foreign trade.

The article said that in the post-war period, Korea's imports and exports increased by an average of 40% per year, and the figure for 1958 increased by 4.5 times compared with 1954.

The article said that the growth of Korea's foreign trade is not limited to quantity, and its structure and types have also changed greatly. In 1958, industrial products exported by Korea accounted for 78.4% of the total exports; however, in 1953, its mineral exports accounted for 85% of the total exports. On the import side, various machines and equipment accounted for 67.6% of the total imports in 1958. The remainder was consumer goods. These imports are conducive to strengthening the foundation of a self-sufficient national economy and improving the people's lives.

The article said that the scope of Korea's foreign trade has also been greatly expanded. At present, Korea has trade agreements with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries on the basis of friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. Since 1957, Korea has also established trade relations with India, Indonesia, Burma, and the United Arab Republic.

In the last part of the article, the author talked about the decline of South Korea's foreign trade. The article said that the South Korean economy is bankrupt. The foreign trade deficit is very large. In 1957, its imports were 21 times greater than its exports. From January to September last year, this figure reached a new peak—28 times.

    新华社21日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社平壤20日讯：最近一期的“今日朝鲜”月刊刊登了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国贸易省副相李长春写的一篇文章，这篇文章回顾了朝鲜对外贸易的发展情况。
    文章说，在战后时期，朝鲜的进出口平均每年增加40％，1958年的数字比1954年增加了四点五倍。
    文章说，朝鲜对外贸易的增长不仅限于数量上，它的结构和种类也有很大的改变。1958年，朝鲜出口的工业产品占出口总额的78.4％；但是，在1953年，它所出口的矿产占出口总额的85％。在进口方面，各种机器和设备占1958年总进口量的67.6％。其余是消费品。这些进口有利于加强自给的国民经济的基础和提高人民的生活。
    文章说，朝鲜对外贸易的范围也大大扩大。目前，朝鲜同苏联、中华人民共和国和其它所有社会主义国家在友好、平等和互利的基础上订有贸易协定。从1957年起，朝鲜还同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿拉伯联合共和国建立了贸易关系。
    作者在文章的最后部分谈到南朝鲜对外贸易的衰落情况。文章说，南朝鲜经济破产。对外贸易逆差很大。在1957年，它的输入量比输出量大二十一倍。在去年1月至9月间，这个数字达到新的高峰——二十八倍。
