　　How to Cultivate Speaking and Writing Skills in First Grade Children
　　Si Xia, Affiliated Elementary School of Nanjing Normal College
    How can children aged seven to seven and a half, after a year of study and with normal development in all aspects, go from being illiterate to writing relatively fluent short essays of about 100 to 300 characters? I believe that to train children's writing skills, we must first cultivate their speaking skills to lay the foundation for writing; secondly, we must carry out various writing activities to create conditions for cultivating children's writing. My writing teaching over the past year has been carried out in the entire language teaching process, interconnectedly.
      Cultivating Children's Speaking Skills
    First graders who have just entered school already have speaking abilities, but they often speak incompletely, use words inappropriately, have many grammatical errors, and often include unnecessary words such as "um, ah," "this, that," "later, later," and sometimes even use local dialects and accents. On the first day of school, I paid attention to listening to the children's speech to understand their language patterns. On the one hand, I promptly corrected their mistakes; on the other hand, I consciously enriched the children's vocabulary in reading teaching and other teaching activities, and cultivated them to speak completely, coherently, and logically, to create favorable conditions for writing training.
    Teachers should pay attention to the completeness of their own language to set an example. I always speak complete sentences for the children to hear. For example, when I ask children to come to the blackboard to write, or ask them to do some work, I always say: "I invite student ×× to come to the blackboard to write." "Who knows what this character is?" "Here is a picture, please look carefully, and when you see it clearly, raise your hand first, and when the teacher asks someone to speak, that person should stand up and speak." The teacher's demonstration of speaking complete sentences is very helpful to the children. I also often consciously teach some commonly used vocabulary in the school, such as "school," "class," "after class," "rest," "quiet," "discipline," "politeness" and other words to the children, and ask them to learn to say them, so that the children gradually get rid of the Nanjing dialect and learn to speak Mandarin. Once a child said to me: "My mother told me to open it immediately." I immediately corrected him and said, "We don't understand this way of speaking, please say it again." The child then corrected himself and said, "My mother told me to go immediately." I paid attention to listening to the children's language in and out of class and encouraged them to speak Mandarin.
  Require children to speak completely, coherently, and systematically. When children first enter school, they often answer questions with only one or two words, such as when asked: "Where do you live?" He answers: "Over there," or "Over here." When asked: "What is your name?" "How old are you this year?" He answers: "×××." "Seven years old." Once I asked a child: "Where did you come from?" He answered: "Home." I asked again: "What home?" He said: "Came from home." I asked again: "Who came from home?" "I." After asking back and forth, he couldn't answer completely. Later, I told him: "Where did you come from? Say it together." He then said: "I came from home."
    A sentence must be said completely, and when several sentences are combined, attention must be paid to the coherence and systematicness of the sentences. Through diversified activities such as picture viewing, retelling, and observing things, children are trained to narrate things coherently and systematically. At first, when children speak according to the picture, they often say whatever they see. For example, when they see a picture of spring scenery, the children say: "There are trees, there are swallows, there are flowers, there is grass." For example, when they are asked to observe the shape of a horse, the children say: "The horse has two ears, the horse has four legs, the horse has a tail, the horse's hair is white, and the horse also has two eyes on its head." They talk about the head for a while, then the legs, and then turn back to the eyes on the head. Therefore, when I ask children to look at pictures, I first give them a few questions: "Everyone, look carefully, what time (or season) and place does this picture represent? Who are the people (or things) in the picture? What are they doing? Say one thing at a time, and after you have said one thing clearly, say another thing." For example, when observing the appearance of an animal, I also give the children appropriate prompts, asking them to look carefully, starting with the things on the head, and after they have finished talking about the things on the head, then talk about the body, legs, and tail. Sometimes I also use a series of questions to ask them to answer one sentence at a time first, and then say them together, such as asking: "What is this place?" (This is our classroom.) "What things are there in our classroom?" (There are blackboards, desks, and chairs in our classroom.) "How are the blackboards, desks, and chairs in our classroom?" (The blackboard in our classroom is wiped very clean, and the desks and chairs are arranged neatly.) "Do you love your classroom?" (I love our classroom.) Finally, let the children say it coherently once.
    Require children to speak correctly and use words appropriately. Lower grade children sometimes speak vaguely, incompletely, and inappropriately. For example, after the lesson "The Big Turnip," I asked them: "Why did the big turnip get pulled out after the little cat came?" They said: "They have more people and more strength." I pointed out: "Is the little cat also a person?" They then changed it to, "The old man, the old woman, the little girl, and the little cat all pulled the turnip together, so the strength became greater."
    For example, when the people of Nanjing were carrying out the campaign to eliminate sparrows, many children said and wrote: "These days, the whole of Nanjing is fighting sparrows..." I asked: "Nanjing is a place, can it fight sparrows?" The children laughed and changed it to "The people of the whole of Nanjing are fighting sparrows." For example, after the lesson on sunflowers, I asked: "What is the use of planting sunflowers?" A child answered: "We plant sunflowers and dedicate them to the country to extract oil." I immediately followed up and asked: "Can the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of sunflowers all be used to extract oil?" They knew it was wrong and laughed, and then changed it to: "We plant sunflowers in the spring, harvest sunflower seeds in the autumn, and dedicate them to the country to extract oil."
    Enrich children's vocabulary by combining visits. How can we enrich children's vocabulary? In addition to conducting current affairs teaching and various common sense teaching related to the text, I often take children to visit the campus or the road to broaden children's horizons, enrich children's vocabulary, and try to combine the vocabulary they have learned in the text and apply it to oral language. For example, when observing the spring scenery, ask them to say "warm weather," "tender green buds on the branches," "beautiful flowers blooming on peach trees and cherry trees." When observing the winter scenery, ask them to say: "The branches are bare." Or when it snows, say: "Trees, houses, and the ground are all white... the sun shines on the snow, sparkling." For example, when visiting the workers repairing the road, the children said: "The workers are really hardworking, they are very enthusiastic!" Because of the actual observation and thorough understanding of the words, the children use words relatively richly and write with content, and the most can write two to three hundred words.
    Cultivating Children's Ability
            from Speaking to Writing
    Cultivate children's writing skills in conjunction with speaking teaching. Through speaking teaching and writing exercises, children can gradually write the characters they have learned. At first, during writing exercises, they are consciously guided to write the words and short sentences they have learned in the text. Gradually, in conjunction with speaking teaching, the short sentences that the children have said are asked to be written down. At the beginning, the teacher writes on the blackboard for everyone to copy, and when the children have a certain level, they are asked to write by themselves. For example, after learning the words "school," "classmate," and "teacher," the teacher asks: "What is the name of our school?" "Who are the people in the school?" "How is the teacher?" "How are the classmates?" Do you like this school?" After the discussion, ask them to say it together and write it into a short essay: "Our school is called Nanjing Normal University Affiliated Primary School. There are many teachers in the school. The teachers are very good. There are many classmates in the school. The classmates are also very good. I like our school."
    Sometimes, children are also guided to use some learned words to arrange sentences, or to connect inverted words and sentences into a short essay. For example, after learning some words such as "father, mother, brother, sister, worker, farmer, and reading, writing, singing, playing ball, sweeping the floor, putting on clothes," they are guided to match them into sentences. They will match them into complete sentences such as: "Father reads, mother sweeps the floor..." After arranging them, ask them to write them in their exercise books.
    Sometimes I also use some familiar characters to form a few short sentences and ask them to take dictation, or tell a short story and ask them to write it out. Gradually cultivating their habit of coherent writing is also an effective way to cultivate children's writing skills.
    Use a variety of methods to cultivate children's writing skills. In addition to carrying out general exercises such as using words to make sentences, filling in words, dictating, and arranging sentences, I also use a variety of methods to guide children to carry out writing exercises to create conditions for cultivating writing skills.
    Oral question and written answer. The teacher asks simple questions orally based on the children's vocabulary and asks the children to answer in writing. And each question has a certain connection before and after. When all the answers are completed, it can become a systematic and complete short essay. For example: "How many weeks does a hen need to hatch chicks? What do the newly hatched chicks look like? What are the uses of raising chickens?" They will write: "A hen needs three weeks to hatch chicks. The newly hatched chicks have yellow fluff and look like small balls of fluff. Chicken meat can be eaten, hens can lay eggs, eggs can also be eaten, and chicken manure can also be used as fertilizer."
    Writing based on pictures. On the basis of telling stories based on pictures, use the illustrations in the books or related wall charts to guide children to systematically tell the complete story on the picture after seeing it, and then systematically write it down to become an organized short essay. This is a commonly used and effective method, and children are also very interested. However, attention must be paid to the fact that the content on the picture must conform to the children's ability to accept it and their life practice, especially the text on which it is based does not have much difficulty. If there are individual unfamiliar characters, the teacher can write them on the blackboard in advance, or ask them to use phonetic letters to replace them. Children often give full play to their imagination in writing.
    Use various activities to write. For example, on March 8th Women's Day, guide children to write letters to their mothers to congratulate them; when the people of Nanjing launched the sparrow eradication campaign, guide children to write wall newspapers about fighting sparrows; after the children planted sunflowers, guide them to record the sunflowers and the growth of the sunflowers; Children's Day on June 1st is their most active day, so guide them to write about how to spend the holiday. At the end of the semester, ask them to write about what they have learned in the past year. Generally, they write fluently, can use punctuation, and some can even paragraph.
    After a year of writing teaching practice, the following preliminary understandings have been obtained:
    Seven-year-old children can carry out writing teaching under the guidance of teachers. Writing teaching cannot be carried out in isolation and must be closely linked to the entire language teaching, that is, speaking, writing, reading, and other teaching activities. To carry out writing teaching, we must grasp the principles of moving from shallow to deep, from simple to complex, combining theory with practice, and diversified methods according to children's ability to accept, so that we can obtain better results.

　　怎样培养小学一年级儿童的说话和写话能力
　　南京师范学院附属小学　斯霞
    七岁至七岁半的儿童，经过一年的学习，在各方面得到正常发展的情况下，怎样从一字不识到能写一百到三百个字左右比较通顺的短文呢？我认为要训练儿童的写话能力，首先要培养儿童的说话能力，为写话打下基础；其次要进行多方面的写话活动，为培养儿童的写话创造条件。我一年来的写话教学，就是在整个的语文教学过程中，相互联系着进行的。
      培养儿童的说话能力
    一年级刚入学的儿童，虽已具有说话能力，但是他们往往说话不完整，用词不恰当，语法很多错误，常常夹着“嗯嗯阿阿”，“这个那个”，“后来后来”等不必要的词儿，有时还带着土话土音。我在开学第一天就注意听儿童的说话，了解他们的语言规律。一方面发现他们有错误及时纠正；另一方面，有意识地在阅读教学和其他教学活动中逐步丰富儿童的词汇，培养他们说话完整、连贯、有条理，为写话训练创造有利条件。
    老师要注意自己语言的完整，才能起示范作用。我总是说完整的话给儿童们听。如我叫儿童到黑板上来写字，或是叫他们做什么工作时，总是这样说：“我请××同学到黑板上来写字”“谁知道这是一个什么字？”“这里有一幅图，请小朋友用心看，看清了，先举手，等老师请谁说，谁就站起来说。”老师这样示范对小朋友说完整的话有很大的帮助。我还常常有意识地讲一些学校中常用的词汇，如，“学校”、“上课”、“下课”、“休息”、“安静”、“守纪律”、“有礼貌”等词语给儿童们听，还叫儿童们学着说，使儿童们逐步改去南京的土语，学说普通话。一次有个儿童对我说：“妈妈叫我马急就开。”我立即纠正他说：“这样的说法我们听不懂，请你再说一遍。”儿童就改正说：“妈妈叫我马上就去。”我在课内课外都很注意听儿童的语言，鼓励他们说普通话。
  要求儿童说话完整、连贯、有系统。儿童刚入学时，回答问题往往只一两个词儿，如问他：“你住在什么地方？”他回答：“那边，”或是“这边。”问他：“你叫什么名字？”“今年几岁？”他回答：“×××。”“七岁。”有一次我问一个儿童：“你从哪儿来？”他回答：“家里。”我再问：“什么家里？”他说：“家里来。”又问：“谁从家里来？”“我。”问来问去他都不能把话答完全，后来我告诉他：“你从什么地方来？连起来说。”他才说出：“我从家里来。”
    一句话要说得完整，几句话组合在一起，就要注意前后的连贯有系统。通过看图、复述、观察事物等多样化的活动，培养儿童连贯有系统地叙述一件事情。起初儿童看图说话时，往往看到什么就说什么，如看到一幅春天的景色图时，儿童们说：“有树、有燕子、有花、有草。”又如叫他们观察马的形状时，儿童说：“马有两只耳朵，马有四条腿，马有一条尾巴，马的毛是白色的，马的头上还有两只眼睛。”他们一会儿说头，一会儿又说腿，回过头来又说头上的眼睛。因此，我叫儿童们看图时，先给他们几个问题：“大家用心看，这幅图是表示什么时候？（或季节）什么地方？图上有哪些人？（或东西）他们在做什么？一件一件地说，说清楚了一件，再说一件。”如在观察一样动物的外形时，也给儿童们作适当的提示，叫他们仔细地看，从头上的东西说起，等头上的东西说完了，再说到身上、腿和尾巴。有时我还利用连续的问题叫他们先一句一句地回答，再连起来说，如问：“这是什么地方？”（这是我们的教室）“我们的教室里有些什么东西？”（我们的教室里有黑板有桌子有椅子）“我们教室里的黑板桌子椅子怎么样？”（我们教室里的黑板擦得很干净，桌子椅子排得很整齐）“你爱你们的教室吗？”（我爱我们的教室）最后使儿童连贯地说一遍。
    要求儿童说话正确，用词恰当。低年级的儿童说话有时词不达意，意思不完整，用词不恰当。如上了“大萝卜”一课后，我问他们：“为什么小花猫来了后，大萝卜就拔起来了。”他们说：“他们人多了，力量大。”我就指出：“小花猫也是人吗？”他们就改为，“老公公、老婆婆、小姑娘，还有小花猫大家一起拔萝卜，力量就大了。”
    又如当南京人民开展消灭麻雀运动的时候，许多儿童在口头上和写话时都这样说：“这几天全南京都在打麻雀……。”我问：“南京是个地方，它能打麻雀吗？”儿童就笑着改为“全南京的人民都在打麻雀。”又如上了向日葵一课后，我问：“种向日葵有什么用？”一个儿童回答：“我们种了向日葵，献给国家榨油。”我紧接着追问：“向日葵有根、茎、叶、花，都可以榨油吗？”他们知道不对，都笑了，就改为：“我们春天种了向日葵，秋天收了葵花子，献给国家榨油。”
    结合参观活动丰富儿童的词汇。怎样才能丰富儿童的词汇？除掉平时进行时事教学和有关课文的各种常识教学外，我常带儿童到校园或马路上去参观，以扩大儿童的眼界，丰富儿童的词汇，并尽量结合课文上学过的词汇，运用到口头语言上来。如观察春天的景色时，叫他们说出“暖和的天气”“树枝上发出嫩绿的芽。”“桃树、樱树上开出美丽的花朵。”观察冬天的景色时，叫他们说出：“树枝上光秃秃的。”或是下雪天时说：“树上、房上、地上到处都白了……，太阳照在雪上，亮晶晶的。”如参观工人叔叔修马路时，儿童说：“工人叔叔真辛苦，他们干劲真大呀！”由于通过实际的观察，和对于字词的彻底理解，因此儿童用词比较丰富，写得也有内容，最多的能写两三百字。
    培养儿童从说到写
            的能力
    结合说话教学培养儿童写话能力。儿童通过说话教学和写字练习，逐渐能写所学过的文字，最初在写字练习时，有意识地指导儿童写课文中所学过的词和短句，逐渐结合说话教学，把儿童所说的短句，叫他们写下来，开始时教师扳书大家抄写，当儿童有一定的程度时，就叫他们自己写。例如学了“学校”“同学”“老师”这些词以后，教师问：“我们的学校叫什么名称？”“学校里有些什么人？”“老师怎么样？”“同学怎么样？”你们喜欢这个学校吗？”谈话后，叫他们连起来说，并写成短文：“我们的学校叫南师附小，学校里有许多老师，老师很好，学校里有许多同学，同学也很好，我喜欢我们的学校。”
    有时还指导儿童们用一些已学过的词来排句，或把颠倒的词句连缀成短文。如学了一些“爸爸、妈妈、哥哥、姐姐、工人、农民和读书、写字、唱歌、拍球、扫地、穿衣服”等词以后，指导他们搭配成句。他们会搭成：“爸爸看书，妈妈扫地……”等完整的句子，排好后叫他们写在练习本上。
    我有时还用一些熟字组成几句短文，叫他们听写，或者讲一个简短的故事叫他们写出来。使他们逐渐养成连贯写话的习惯，也是培养儿童写话能力的有效办法之一。
    运用多种多样的方法培养儿童的写话能力。除进行一般的用词造句、填词、听写、排句等练习外，我还采用多种多样的方法指导儿童进行写话练习，为培养写话能力创造条件。
    口问笔答。老师根据儿童的词汇，口头提出简单的问题，要儿童笔答。而每一个问题，前后有一定的联系。等到全部答完，就可成为有系统的完整的短文。例如：“母鸡孵小鸡要几个星期？刚孵出来的小鸡像什么样子？养鸡有什么用处？”他们就写出“母鸡孵小鸡要三个星期，刚孵出来的小鸡黄黄的绒毛像一个个的绒球。鸡的肉可以吃，母鸡会生蛋，蛋也可以吃，鸡的粪还可以做肥料。”
    看图写话。在看图讲故事的基础上，应用书上的插图或有关的挂图，指导儿童看后能系统地讲出图上完整的故事，然后系统地写下来，成为有组织的短文。这是一般常用的有效的方法，儿童也很有兴趣。但是必须注意图上的内容要符合儿童的接受能力、生活实践，特别是所根据的文字没有多大的困难。如有个别生字，老师可以预先写在黑板上，或叫他们用拼音字母代替。儿童在写话中往往充分发挥他们的想像力。
    利用各种活动写话。如三八妇女节时指导儿童给妈妈写信祝贺；南京人民开展灭雀运动时，指导儿童写打麻雀的墙报；儿童种了向日葵后，指导他们记载向日葵和向日葵生长的情况；遇到六一儿童节，更是他们最活跃的一天，便指导他们写怎样过节日。到了学期结束时，叫他们写出一年来学到了些什么。一般都写得通顺，能运用标点，有的还能分段。
    经过一年来写话教学的实践，得出下面几点初步的认识：
    七岁儿童在老师的指导下，可以进行写话教学。写话教学不能孤立进行，必须和整个的语文教学，即说话、写字、阅读等教学活动密切联系。进行写话教学，必须根据儿童的接受能力，掌握由浅入深，由简到繁，理论联系实际等等的原则，和多样化的方法，就可获得更好的效果。
