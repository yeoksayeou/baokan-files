Overcome Right-leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Implement Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

"No one should engage in unfounded speculation, nor plan actions that exceed the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, nor force themselves to do things that are truly impossible. However, the current problem is that right-leaning conservative thinking is causing trouble in many areas, preventing work in many aspects from adapting to the development of objective situations. The current problem is that many people believe that things that could have been accomplished with effort are impossible. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to constantly criticize those right-leaning conservative thoughts that do exist."
	— Mao Zedong, Preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"

Seize the months of August and September, further launch a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy, summon up full energy, resolutely oppose the newly emerging right-leaning sentiments among some cadres, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan – this is the current urgent task on the economic front, including industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce.

In the first half of this year, all sectors of the national economy have achieved new and significant accomplishments based on the great leap forward of last year. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and cadres are spirited and full of energy, guaranteeing the monthly increase in industrial production and the bumper harvest of summer crops with high labor enthusiasm. Although it is currently the hot season, whether in factories, mines, construction sites, or fields, people are overcoming the difficulties of material conditions and various natural disasters, engaging in heroic and intense labor to fulfill the state plan and strive for a good autumn harvest. The current economic situation is one of continued leap forward, which is a very favorable condition for completing the production and construction tasks in the second half of the year.

However, on the current economic front, while the broad masses and cadres are summoning up full energy, a tendency has emerged: a sense of fear of difficulty and relaxation is growing among some cadres. They exaggerate certain difficulties existing in their work, and ignore or underestimate the great achievements already obtained and the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties. They lack confidence in overcoming difficulties. They do not try every possible means to complete tasks that are permitted by objective conditions and can be completed through subjective effort, believing that the lower the plan and targets, the better, and defending their right-leaning conservative thinking. This is a right-leaning danger on the current economic front that deserves serious attention. In order to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's continued leap forward plan, it is necessary to resolutely criticize and overcome this right-leaning sentiment.

The Party's General Line is to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This general line has armed the broad masses of cadres and people, and has already been proven to be completely correct by the living facts of last year's great leap forward and this year's continued leap forward. In doing any work, we must summon up full energy, not slack off; we must strive for the upper reaches, not be content with being in the lower reaches; we must strive for more, faster, better, and more economical results, not less, slower, worse, and more wasteful results. The spirit of seeking truth from facts that our Party has always advocated is to fully exert subjective initiative according to objective needs and possibilities, and strive to do a better job, and definitely not to fail to work hard on things that can be done according to objective and subjective conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "No one should engage in unfounded speculation, nor plan actions that exceed the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, nor force themselves to do things that are truly impossible. However, the current problem is that right-leaning conservative thinking is causing trouble in many areas, preventing work in many aspects from adapting to the development of objective situations. The current problem is that many people believe that things that could have been accomplished with effort are impossible. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to constantly criticize those right-leaning conservative thoughts that do exist." These words that Comrade Mao Zedong said at the end of 1955 are a correct remedy for the current right-leaning sentiments among some cadres.

Of course, there are difficulties on our road of continued leap forward. However, these difficulties are only temporary and local difficulties on our road of leap forward. What we are doing is a revolutionary cause that turns the world upside down. It is unimaginable that there would be no difficulties. Our Party has grown and strengthened in the struggle against all kinds of difficulties, and has moved from one victory to another. Now the conditions for us to overcome difficulties are not worse than in the past, but much better. As long as we implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and fully mobilize the masses, the existing difficulties can be completely resolved in a relatively short period of time. Many localities, departments, and enterprises have done just that, and as a result, the enthusiasm of the masses there is very high. They have not only solved the difficulties in their work, but have also achieved new accomplishments. The tremendous achievements made in industrial and agricultural production in the first half of this year are the most powerful proof. Lack of confidence in overcoming difficulties, sighing and complaining in the face of difficulties, and failing to work hard to do what could have been done are attitudes that communists and some revolutionary cadres should absolutely not adopt. Any fear of difficulty, relaxation, or discouragement is very harmful to the cause of socialism. Morale can be boosted, but it cannot be dampened. Pouring cold water on the high labor enthusiasm of the masses and dampening their morale is simply a crime.

Seven months have passed this year, and in the remaining five months, the tasks on the economic front still require great effort to complete. The months of August and September are a decisive moment for completing and overfulfilling this year's plan. Because the raw materials, materials, fuel, and finished products produced in these two months in the industrial sector directly affect the needs of production, construction, and people's lives in the last three months of this year. The projects completed in these two months in the field of capital construction can also be put into production before the end of the year. These two months are the key to determining the autumn crop harvest in agriculture. These two months are the peak season in the commercial sector, and whether it is procurement or supply work, it requires very intense effort. The transportation sector also needs to transport as much as possible in these two months to reduce the pressure of winter transportation. Opportunities must not be missed, and time waits for no one. It is necessary to immediately seize the months of August and September, summon up full energy, resolutely overcome any right-leaning sentiments, fully mobilize the masses, and launch a new upsurge of a broad mass movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy in industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and the entire economic front.

In this movement to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to focus on the production of steel, coal, timber, cement, machinery, and other products that serve industry, as well as the production of daily-use industrial products and handicrafts that are necessary for the lives of the broad masses. It is also necessary to handle various semi-finished products in a timely and appropriate manner. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on completing those major, urgently needed, and quickly completed capital construction projects. It is necessary to focus on the quick loading and unloading of railway transportation, and launch a mass movement for short-distance transportation on the premise of rationally arranging labor forces. Whether in industry, transportation, or capital construction, it is necessary to implement hard work, practical work, and clever work. It is necessary to strengthen enterprise management, focusing not only on quantity, but also on improving quality and increasing variety, and ensuring safe production. It is necessary to pay attention to economic accounting, practice strict economy, especially in saving raw materials, materials, fuel, power, and labor, and strive to reduce costs. In agriculture, it is necessary to focus on the management of autumn fields, resolutely fight against natural disasters such as drought and floods, ensure a good harvest of grain crops and cash crops, and develop diversified operations, vigorously increasing the production of non-staple foods such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. In the commercial sector, it is necessary to focus on procurement and supply work, and strive for a further improvement in the market situation. All of these tasks require Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, put politics in command, carry forward the glorious traditions of the mass line and seeking truth from facts, mobilize the broad masses from all aspects, boost the enthusiasm of the masses, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan.

The tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland is approaching! Let all our cadres, together with the people of the whole country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, unite as one, summon up full energy, and forge ahead bravely, to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new and brilliant achievements in increasing production and practicing economy!

### 克服右倾情绪　厉行增产节约

    克服右倾情绪　厉行增产节约
    “任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”
        ——毛泽东：“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言
    抓紧八、九两个月，进一步展开一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，鼓足干劲，坚决反对在一部分干部中新近抬头的右倾情绪，努力完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划——这是工业、农业、运输业、商业等经济战线上当前的迫切任务。
    今年上半年，国民经济各部门在去年大跃进的基础上，又取得了新的重大成就，广大工农群众和干部，精神奋发，干劲十足，以高涨的劳动热情，保证工业生产的逐月上升和农业夏季作物的丰收。目前虽在暑季，但无论在工厂、矿山、工地和田野，人们更为克服物质条件的困难和各种自然灾害，为完成国家计划和争取秋季丰收，进行着英勇的紧张的劳动。目前的经济形势，是继续跃进的形势，这对于完成下半年的生产建设任务，是一个很有利的条件。
    但是，目前经济战线上，在广大群众和干部鼓足干劲的同时，出现了一种倾向，这就是一部分干部中滋长了一种畏难松劲情绪，他们夸大工作中存在的某些困难，忽视或者低估了已经获得的伟大成绩和克服困难的有利条件。他们对于克服困难信心不足，对于本来是客观条件许可和经过主观努力可以完成的任务，不去千方百计地努力完成，认为计划、指标越低越好，替自己的右倾保守思想辩护。这是目前经济战线上值得严重注意的右倾危险。为了争取完成和超额完成今年继续跃进的计划，必须坚决地批判和克服这种右倾情绪。
    党的总路线是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这条总路线武装了广大干部和人民群众，并且已经为去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进的活生生的事实证明是完全正确的。我们做任何工作，都必须鼓足干劲，而不是松劲泄气；都必须力争上游，而不是甘居下游；都必须又多又快又好又省，而不是又少又慢又差又费。我们党历来提倡的实事求是的精神，就是根据客观的需要和可能，充分发挥主观能动性，力求把工作做得更好，而决不是对于那些根据客观条件和主观条件可以做到的事情不努力去做。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”毛泽东同志在1955年底说的这些话，对于目前一部分干部中的右倾情绪，正是一付对症的良药。
    当然，在我们继续跃进的道路上，并不是没有困难的。但是，这些困难不过是我们跃进道路上的一些暂时的局部的困难。我们干的是翻天复地的革命事业，没有困难是不可设想的。我们党正是在同各种各样的困难作斗争中成长和壮大，从一个胜利走向又一个胜利的。现在我们克服困难的条件，不是比过去更差，而是比过去好得多了。只要我们贯彻执行党中央的指示，充分发动群众，目前存在的一些困难是完全可以在比较短的时间内得到解决的。许多地方、部门和企业正是这样作了的，因而那里的群众干劲很大，不但解决了工作中的困难，而且取得了新的成就。今年上半年工农业生产获得的巨大的成就，就是最有力的证明。对克服困难信心不足，在困难面前唉声叹气，不努力去做那些本来可以做到的事情，这是共产党人和一些革命干部绝对不应该采取的态度。任何畏难、松劲、泄气，对于社会主义事业都是非常有害的。气可鼓而不可泄。对于群众的高涨的劳动热情大泼冷水，泄群众的气，就简直是罪恶的了。
    今年已经过去了七个月，剩下的五个月中，经济战线上的任务仍然是需要很大的努力才能够完成的，而八、九两个月，对于完成和超额完成今年的计划，又是一个决定性的时刻。因为工业方面在这两个月中生产出来的原料、材料、燃料和制成品，直接影响到今年最后三个月的生产建设和人民生活的需要。基本建设方面在这两个月中完成的工程，还可以在年终以前投入生产。农业方面这两个月正是决定秋季作物收成的关键。商业方面这两个月正是旺季到来，无论收购或供应的工作都需要有十分紧张的努力。运输方面也需要在这两个月之中，尽可能地多运，以减轻冬季运输的压力。机不可失，时不再来。必须立即抓紧八、九两个月，鼓足干劲，坚决克服任何右倾情绪，充分发动群众，在工业、农业、运输业、商业等方面，在整个经济战线上，掀起一个新的以增产节约为中心的广大的群众运动高潮。
    在这个增产节约运动中，必须抓紧钢铁、煤炭、木材、水泥、机械以及其他为工业服务的生产，为广大群众生活所必需的日用工业品和手工业品的生产，及时地妥善地处理各种半成品；必须集中力量完成那些重大的、迫切需要的、很快可以完工的基本建设工程；必须抓紧铁路运输的快装快卸，并且在合理安排劳动力的前提下，展开一个短途运输的群众运动。无论工业、运输业和基本建设，都要实行苦干、实干、巧干，都要加强企业管理，既抓数量、又抓提高质量和增加品种，并且保证安全生产；都要注意经济核算，厉行节约，特别是节约原料、材料、燃料、动力和劳动力，努力降低成本。农业方面必须抓紧秋田管理，坚决同干旱、涝灾等自然灾害作斗争，保证粮食作物和经济作物的丰收；并且发展多种经营，大力增产猪、羊、鸡、鸭等副食品。商业方面必须抓紧收购和供应工作，力争市场情况的进一步好转。所有这些工作，都要求各级党委加强领导，政治挂帅，发扬群众路线和实事求是的光荣传统，从各方面动员广大的群众，鼓足群众的干劲，为完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划而奋斗。
    伟大祖国的国庆十周年快到了！让我们所有干部同全国人民一道，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，同心同德，鼓足干劲，奋勇前进，以增产节约的新的辉煌成就，迎接国庆十周年吧！
