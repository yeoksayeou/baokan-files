Taking the Lead and Inspiring the Masses
Beijing Crane Factory Structural Workshop Party Members Serve as Role Models in Everything

(Our report) The Communist Party members of the Beijing Crane Factory's Structural Workshop resolutely implement the Party's resolutions, take the lead in everything, and do mass work for everyone, which has powerfully promoted the workshop's production and various tasks.

There are sixty Communist Party members in the Structural Workshop. They resolutely implement the Party's resolutions and use their practical actions to motivate the masses to implement them. Recently, the workshop's workers had a slackening mood due to insufficient raw material supply, and they did not actively think of ways to overcome difficulties under the existing conditions. At this time, the factory Party committee conveyed the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposing to criticize the slackening mood, boost morale, and launch a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. The Structural Workshop's Party branch first held a meeting for self-examination, and then convened a branch general meeting. At the workshop's group meetings, Party members put forward many suggestions for utilizing waste materials and saving raw materials. After the meeting, the groups acted quickly, formulated specific measures, and launched a heated competition between the groups. Cui Dianlin, a Party member of the belt conveyor group, often paid attention to utilizing waste materials. He was not afraid of trouble and went to the scrap pile to find raw materials according to the drawings. His actions motivated all the workers in the group to find waste materials. This group saved more than ten tons of raw materials and utilized waste materials in July. Hao Qimiao, a Party member of the truck crane group, proposed a suggestion to change the design of the driver's cab of the double-beam crane. After collective research and adoption, it saved 300 kilograms of steel per unit and doubled efficiency. Party members of the double-beam crane group used their spare time to review drawings, arrange the use of waste materials, and put forward suggestions for changing the design. In July, they also used more than two tons of waste materials and saved steel. Driven by the Party members, and through the efforts of all the workers in the workshop, the Structural Workshop utilized more than sixteen tons of waste materials and saved thirty-six tons of steel in July, over fulfilling the monthly production plan. The workers were even more motivated this month, and they proposed to utilize 175 tons of waste materials and save 140 tons of steel in August.

The Party members in this workshop can resolutely complete their tasks in production, especially when encountering critical problems, they step forward and go wherever there are difficulties. In June of this year, the double-beam crane group of this factory could not solve the problem of transporting steel plates, which affected the completion of the group's production plan. This group needed to move steel plates ten to twenty times a day at most, each time using fifteen people, and the efficiency was not high. In addition, people who were in the middle of production were called over to move steel plates every once in a while, which affected the entire production. At this time, the Party branch called on Party members to change the situation of "hard work more than clever work" and take the lead in thinking of ways and launching a technical revolution. Communist Party member Zuo Shuwen thought hard and came up with many ways. Finally, he researched a method of installing cantilever cranes on gantry cranes, which mechanized the handling of steel plates, resulting in saving four-fifths of the manpower and increasing efficiency five times. All the materials for the cantilever crane, except for a motor, were made from waste materials. Recently, the workshop accepted the task of producing eighty-three belt conveyors. The task was tight, especially since the truck crane group, one of the two groups undertaking this production task, was producing this type of machine for the first time. However, the Party members of this group actively took the lead in improving eleven types of jigs, and as a result, they completed half a month's task in five days.

In normal times, whenever the interests of the Party require it, the Party members in this workshop always take the initiative to find ways to complete it. After the factory launched the quality improvement campaign, Communist Party member Ying Hongen first came up with the idea of visiting users to improve quality. The workshop leadership immediately accepted his suggestion and visited the workshop's main user, the fitter workshop. As a result, the fitter workshop immediately put forward fifty suggestions related to quality, which greatly promoted the improvement of product quality in the Structural Workshop. After the factory Party committee called on the workers to make full use of waste materials, Communist Party members Cui Dianlin, Zhao Zhe, and others immediately became the most active people running to the scrap yard. Cui Dianlin was afraid that the plate cutting machine workers would find it troublesome and unwilling to cut waste materials, so he personally ran to the scrap yard to transport the waste materials to the plate cutting machine group and actively helped the plate cutting machine workers find ways to cut waste materials.

The Party members in this workshop not only resolutely implement the Party's resolutions and take the lead in everything, but also care about the masses in their work, thinking, and life, and advance together with the masses. Liu Fugui, a worker in the truck crane group, always cut materials poorly. A steel plate should be cut into three pieces, but he often could only cut it into two pieces. Party member Wu Shilu took the initiative to teach him the method of cutting materials and helped him draw lines. Now Liu Fugui has been able to master the cutting technology relatively skillfully. Party members exchange ideas with the masses at any time, and a system has been formed. For example, Meng Qisheng, a worker, originally had some wrong ideas. Communist Party members Zhao Zhe, Zuo Shuwen, and other comrades often talked with him and exchanged ideas, which quickly improved his political consciousness.

The Structural Workshop's Party branch pays great attention to educating Party members on the role of exemplary leadership. On the one hand, they organize Party members to study the Party's policies and history to improve their awareness; at the same time, they educate everyone through the specific examples of some Party members. Last year, a Party member in the workshop did not have much enthusiasm for work because he cared about personal interests, which had a negative impact on the masses. The branch immediately organized all Party members to discuss this typical example. Everyone not only helped him correct his wrong ideas, but also some Party members connected with reality and examined their shortcomings in not playing an exemplary role among the masses. Whenever the workshop accepts new tasks, the branch first explains the details to the Party members and makes requirements, so that the Party members are clear in their minds and have specific goals to strive for. Because every Party member in the Structural Workshop can take the initiative to consciously play an exemplary leading role, all the workers in the workshop can unite around the Party and often excellently complete production tasks. Therefore, this workshop was rated as a red flag workshop of the entire factory last year.

    走在前头给群众鼓劲
    北京起重机厂结构车间党员事事做榜样
    本报讯　北京起重机器厂结构车间的共产党员们，坚决执行党的决议，事事走在前头，人人做群众工作，有力地推动了车间生产和各项工作。
    结构车间共有六十名共产党员，他们坚决执行党的决议，并且用实际行动带动群众贯彻执行。最近这个车间的职工因为原料供应不足存在着松劲情绪，没有更积极地想办法在现有条件下克服困难。这时，工厂党委传达了中共北京市委的指示，提出批判松劲情绪，鼓足干劲，掀起增产节约的新高潮。结构车间党支部首先开会进行检查，然后召开支部大会。在车间各小组会上党员提出许多利用废料和节约原材料的建议。会后各小组纷纷行动起来，订出了具体措施，组与组之间展开了热烈的竞赛。皮带运输机小组党员崔殿林经常注意利用废料，他不怕麻烦事先到废料堆按着图纸找原料，他的行动带动全组工人都来找废料。这个小组7月份节约原料和利用废料共十吨多。汽车吊小组党员郝起淼提出了改变双梁吊司机室设计的建议，经集体研究被采纳后，每台节约钢材三百公斤，提高效率一倍。双梁吊小组的党员利用业余时间审查图纸，安排利用废料，并提出改变设计的建议，7月份也利用了两吨多废料，节约了钢材。在党员的带动下，经过车间全体职工的努力，7月份结构车间共利用废料十六吨多，节约钢材三十六吨，超额完成了月生产计划。这个月职工干劲更足，他们提出8月份要利用废料一百七十五吨，节约钢材一百四十吨。
    这个车间的党员在生产中都能坚决地完成任务，特别是碰到关键性的问题，更是挺身而出，做到哪里有困难就到哪里去。今年6月，这个厂的双梁吊小组因搬运钢板的问题不能解决，影响小组生产计划的完成。这个小组每天最多需搬钢板十几次到二十次，每次用十五个人，而且效率不高。加上每隔一会儿就要把正在进行生产的人叫过来搬钢板，因此影响整个的生产。这时党支部号召党员改变“苦干多于巧干”的情况，带头想办法，大闹技术革命。共产党员左树文苦思苦钻，想了许多办法，最后研究出在龙门吊上安悬臂吊的方法，使搬运钢板工作机械化，结果节省五分之四的人力，提高效率五倍。悬臂吊的全部材料除一个马达以外都是利用废料做成的。最近车间接受了生产八十三台皮带运输机的任务，任务紧，特别是担负这个生产任务的两个小组之一汽车吊小组生产这种机器还是第一次，但是这个小组的党员们积极带头改进了十一种胎具，结果五天完成了半个月的任务。
    在平时，凡是党的利益所要求的，这个车间里的党员总是主动想办法去完成。工厂开展提高质量运动以后，共产党员英洪恩首先动脑筋想出了访问用户来提高质量的办法，车间领导方面立即接受他的建议，访问了车间的主要用户——钳工车间，结果钳工车间一次就向他们提出了五十条有关质量的建议，大大促进了结构车间产品质量的提高。工厂党委号召职工们充分利用废料，共产党员崔殿林、赵哲等马上成为跑废料场最积极的人。崔殿林怕切板机工人嫌麻烦不愿切废料，他就亲自跑到废料场把废料运到切板机小组，积极帮助切板机工人想办法切废料。
    这个车间的党员不仅坚决执行党的决议，事事走在前头，而且还能在工作、思想、生活上关心群众，和群众一道前进。汽车吊小组工人刘富奎下料总下不好，一块钢板应切成三块，而他常常只能切成两块，党员吴士禄主动教他下料的办法，帮助他划线，现在刘富奎已经能比较熟练地掌握住下料技术了。党员们随时和群众交心、交换意见，已形成了一种制度，如工人孟启生本来有些错误思想，共产党员赵哲、左树文和其他同志经常找他谈心、交换意见，使他政治觉悟迅速提高。
    结构车间党支部十分注意对党员进行模范带头作用的教育。他们一方面组织党员学习党的政策、党的历史，提高党员的觉悟；同时通过一些党员的具体事例教育大家。去年车间里有一个党员因为计较个人利益，工作干劲不大，在群众中造成了不好的影响，支部立即组织全体党员讨论这个典型事例，大家不仅帮助他改正了错误思想，有的党员还联系实际，检查了自己在群众中模范作用不够的缺点。这个车间支部每当接受了新的任务，首先向党员交底，提出要求，使党员做到心中有数，有具体奋斗目标。由于结构车间每个党员都能主动自觉地起模范带头作用，使车间全体职工都能团结在党的周围，经常出色地完成生产任务，因此，这个车间去年被评为全厂的红旗车间。
