　　“Broken Bridge” is a well-known excerpt in many opera genres, and each “Broken Bridge” has its own distinct characteristics. However, of all the versions I have seen, I like the Yang Opera version of “Broken Bridge” the most.
　　In the old script of the Yang Opera "Broken Bridge," the "Broken Bridge" is written as a truly broken bridge, hence the action of Xiao Qing building a bridge. When the Jiangsu Provincial Yang Opera Troupe was excavating this play, they felt that although the idea of building a bridge was good, Xiao Qing's main role in this scene was not to build a bridge. Suppose that after the boat trip, Xiao Qing had enthusiastically helped the lovers to get married like Hong Niang. Then, in the “Broken Bridge” scene, this fierce girl is trying her best to make her sister sever her love with Xu Xian.
　　Based on Xiao Qing's agitated mood at the time, the reviser added a very good action for Xiao Qing. That is, when Bai Niangzi was touched by the scene of the broken bridge, Xiao Qing, seeing her sister in such pain, could not restrain her anger. Seeing the broken bridge, she hated Xu Xian even more, and hating Xu Xian, she was angered by the broken bridge. So she split the broken bridge with a sword. This is the most vivid character depiction. At this time and in this scene, Xiao Qing's action is more powerful than thousands of words.
　　The bridge is broken, but Bai Niangzi's love for Xu Xian is not broken. Xiao Qing wants to bid farewell to her sister, but she can't bear to abandon her sister and the baby who is about to be born. What to do? In the end, it was Xiao Qing's hand that rebuilt the broken bridge. Building the bridge went against Xiao Qing's wishes, but as she sang:
　　"The green willow branches are not roots of hatred. Today I use you to reconnect the soul-severing bridge. I only build this bridge because of my deep sisterly love."
　　If Xiao Qing only split the bridge but did not rebuild it, this character would not be full enough. Whether it is splitting the bridge or building the bridge, she is doing it for her sister. Therefore, two completely different actions have the same effect—highlighting Xiao Qing's deep affection for Bai Niangzi.
　　Hua Suqin, who plays Bai Niangzi, and Fang Zhujun, who plays Xiao Qing, are both famous Yang Opera actors. They embody the author's intentions very well, and enrich the script through their performances. For example, in the play, when Xu Xian begs Xiao Qing for mercy, Xiao Qing hates his pleading appearance, turns her face away, and just happens to meet Bai Niangzi's pleading eyes. So she suppresses her anger and with a "clang," she puts her sword back into its scabbard! In this performance, Fang Zhujun made the audience clearly see Xiao Qing's mood—Xiao Qing already knew at this time that killing Xu Xian was equivalent to killing her sister, so she had to put her sword back into its scabbard; but she could not eliminate her contempt for Xu Xian, and her complaint about Bai Niangzi's excessive tenderness. So this heavy "clang" sound is also an expression of her opinion.
　　Hua Suqin's performance is even more known for its subtlety. When Xu Xian and Xiao Qing finally helped her across the bridge, she sang: "The three of us walk home together, step by step across the broken bridge." These two lines of singing contain infinite emotion. She does not feel that everything will disappear from now on. From her performance and singing, the audience understands how much trauma the broken bridge has left in Bai Niangzi's heart! The kind and gentle woman shaped by Comrade Hua Suqin reveals a slight joy on her face as she walks across the broken bridge step by step. She is probably glad that after walking across this broken bridge, she will end her misfortune from now on. The reason why actors can have such a delicate performance is mainly due to a deep understanding of this tragedy.
　　This excerpt fully utilizes the broken bridge, and the writing of the characters always revolves around the broken bridge. This writing method is worth learning.

### 小青劈桥又搭桥

    小青劈桥又搭桥
　　简慧
    “断桥”是许多剧种都有的折子戏，每个“断桥”几乎都有它自己的某些特点，但是就我所看过的来说，我最喜欢扬剧的“断桥”。
    扬剧“断桥”的老本中，把“断桥”写成真正断了的桥，因此有小青搭桥的动作。江苏省扬剧团在挖掘这个剧目时感到搭桥这个设想虽好，但是小青在这场戏里所起的主要不是搭桥作用。假使说小青在游湖后，曾经像红娘一样热心地帮助有情人成眷属，那么，在“断桥”一场，这个烈性的姑娘是竭力要使姐姐斩断和许仙的爱情了。
    根据小青当时激愤的心情，整理者给小青增加了一个很好的动作，那就是当白娘子见断桥触景生情时，小青见姐姐如此痛苦，无法抑止自己的愤怒，见断桥更恨许仙，恨许仙，迁怒断桥，于是一剑就把断桥劈断了。这是最形象的性格描写。此时此景，小青这个动作真比千言万语要有力得多。
    桥断了，可是白娘子对许仙的爱情没有断，小青想辞别姐姐，又不忍抛下姐姐和那个即将诞生的娃娃。怎么办？最后还是由小青的手将劈断了的桥再重新搭好。搭桥，这本是违背小青意愿的，但正如她所唱的那样：
    “青青杨柳条，总不是仇根苗。今天用你重连断魂桥，我只为姐妹情深才把桥儿来搭好。”
    如果小青只劈桥，而不搭桥，这个性格也是不够丰满的。无论是劈桥，还是搭桥，她都是为了姐姐，因此，两个截然不同的动作却起了同一的效果——突出了小青对白娘子的情长谊深。
    扮演白娘子的华素琴和扮演小青的房竹君都是扬剧的著名演员，她们很好地体现了作者的意图，并且通过她们的表演丰富了剧本。譬如剧中当许仙向小青求情时，小青厌恶他那种求饶的样子，转过脸去，正好遇到白娘子投来恳求的眼光，于是她强压住自己的愤怒，“?”的一声，将剑入鞘！房竹君在这一段表演里，使观众清楚的看出小青的心绪——小青，这时已经知道杀了许仙就等于杀了姐姐，所以她不能不将剑入鞘；但是她不能消除对许仙的鄙薄，和对白娘子过于柔情的埋怨。所以这重重的“?”的一声，也正是表现了她的意见。
    华素琴的表演，更是以细腻见长。当最后许仙、小青搀扶她过桥时，她唱：“三人同走回家道，一步一步过断桥。”这两句唱，有着无限的感慨，她不是感到从此烟消云散。观众从她的表演和唱腔中，懂得断桥在白娘子心里留下了多么大的创伤！华素琴同志塑造的这个温厚的女人当她一步一步过断桥时，脸上流露出一种微微的喜悦，她大概在庆幸自己走过这座断桥后，将从此结束她的厄运。演员之所以能够有这样细腻的表演，主要是对这出悲剧有了深刻的理解。
    这个折子戏里充分的利用了断桥，始终围绕着断桥写人物，这种写法很值得学习。
