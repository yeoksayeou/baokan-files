According to a report in the Anhui Daily: In its struggle against drought, Guanyi People's Commune in Feixi County, Anhui Province, has fully utilized and brought into play the enormous advantages of the People's Commune. On the basis of tiered management, it has carried out equivalent exchange and mutual assistance of water resources, tools, and labor. Unified arrangements and deployment are made on a larger scale, resulting in more rational and effective use, demonstrating the power of disaster resistance, and inspiring greater enthusiasm among commune members, who are determined to fight the drought to the end and seize a bumper harvest.

Since its establishment in September last year, this commune has brought significant benefits to the masses with its strong vitality: this year's summer grain output increased by 20% compared to last year, and oilseed production nearly doubled; more than 15,000 mu of early rice generally yielded a bumper harvest. According to statistics of the already harvested and threshed portion, the output per unit area increased by 34.7% compared to last year. Since June this year, due to scarce rainfall, most areas of the commune have experienced drought, with the Qixin, Pengxu, Shibao, and Xietang brigades lacking water sources, leaving more than 5,800 mu of mid-season rice without irrigation. The commune Party committee studied this situation and, based on the principle of the most rational and effective use of water, unified the arrangement of water sources, adjusted the irrigation system according to the terrain, and fully utilized the effectiveness of existing reservoirs and large dams. It also carried out adjustments of surplus and deficiency of water sources between brigades and between teams. Five reservoirs, including Tongwa and Jiaotoubei, expanded their irrigation area from more than 15,000 mu to 20,500 mu by digging ditches to divert water, solving the water shortage problem of three brigades. For example, the Tongwa Reservoir of the Guanyi Brigade had ample water storage, ensuring a bumper harvest in the original irrigation area with surplus, while some areas of the Shibao Brigade and Fanggang Brigade were short of water sources due to high terrain and few dams; although cooperation was carried out in last year's drought resistance, the water source could not be fully utilized due to the small scale of agricultural cooperatives and other conditions. This year, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the commune Party committee, channels were repaired and opened through mutual consultation, and the water from the Tongwa Reservoir was diverted to more than ten miles away, solving the irrigation problem of more than 1,400 mu of mid-season rice fields in the Shibao and Fanggang brigades. When the continuous stream of clear water flowed into the dry farmland, the commune members of these two brigades were very excited. They said, "The water is brought by communization, which gold and silver cannot buy," and "The commune has great power, and we are not afraid even if the sky falls."

While unifying the arrangement of water sources and adjusting the surplus and deficiency of water sources, the commune also carried out equivalent exchange and mutual assistance of materials and manpower according to the needs of drought resistance and production. More than 12,000 laborers in the commune were divided into two fronts, "double rush" and drought resistance, and detailed division of labor was carried out according to each person's skills, expertise, physical strength, and weakness, and various professional teams and groups were organized. The method of contracting tasks, ensuring quality, ensuring time, and ensuring work points was adopted, which greatly improved work efficiency, solved the problem of labor shortage, and enabled the "double rush" and drought resistance to advance side by side. Of the more than 8,000 mu of early rice that have been harvested, 2,400 mu have been replanted with late autumn crops after drought resistance. In brigades and teams with severe drought, labor and tools were insufficient. According to the needs of drought resistance, the commune organized cooperation of tools and labor between brigades and between teams. On the basis of tiered management, the cooperation adopted the methods of exchanging labor, recording work, and equivalent exchange. The cooperation between teams was handled according to labor quotas, work evaluation, and unified distribution; the cooperation between brigades was based on the burden of benefited farmland, such as if one party benefited and the other party did not, the benefited brigade would record the work, and then return the work or pay wages after autumn. This not only enabled cooperation but also mutual benefit, so that manpower and materials could be used most timely and effectively for drought resistance. According to this principle, the commune transferred 650 laborers and 90 waterwheels from six brigades, including Zhongpai and Dengta, where the drought was relatively mild, to support the four brigades of Pengxu, etc., which had high terrain, few water sources, large canal excavation tasks, and high water lift, so that the seedlings in these severely drought-stricken areas were quickly rescued.

With its large population, the commune also completed huge projects in drought resistance that could not be completed by advanced cooperatives. In order to solve the irrigation problem in areas lacking water sources, with the support of the county Party committee, the commune rushed to build a three-stage electric irrigation station. The commune unified and organized more than 2,400 drought resistance forces from seven brigades, including Dengta, and dug more than ten li of dry canals in a few days. At present, it can carry out two-stage water lifting and irrigate more than 10,200 mu of fields; after completion, it can solve the irrigation problem of 20,000 mu of fields in seven brigades. Among them, the Guangrong Brigade had 360 mu of high land, which required 36 stages of waterwheels to lift water, and now it can be irrigated by gravity. The commune members said, "Without communization, where would electric irrigation come from!"

In order to meet the needs of drought resistance, the commune also unified the collection of materials, deployed craftsmen, and rushed to make and repair more than 500 waterwheels, timely arming the drought resistance forces. At the same time, the development of public welfare undertakings after communization has freed women from the heavy burden of housework, allowing them to engage in production without any worries. More than 6,000 female laborers in the commune have invested in drought resistance and "double rush", fighting alongside male commune members.

The People's Commune has shown great power in the drought resistance struggle, which has further encouraged the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. Before August 5, the commune had already lifted water to rescue more than 18,000 mu of rice and more than 3,900 mu of dry land.

    大兵团大协作　大显抗灾威力
    人民公社力能胜天
    馆驿公社统一安排水源物尽其用，抢收抢种修工程样样不误
    据安徽日报消息　安徽省肥西县馆驿人民公社在抗旱斗争中，充分运用和发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，使水源、工具、劳力在分级管理的基础上，开展等价交换，协作互助，在更大范围内作统一安排和调度，得到更合理更有效的使用，大显抗灾威力，鼓起了社员的更大干劲，决心与干旱奋战到底，夺取丰收。
    这个公社自去年9月建立以来，就以它强大的生命力给群众带来了显著利益：今年午季粮食比去年增产20％，油料增产近一倍；一万五千多亩早稻普遍丰收，据已经收割脱粒部分的统计，单位面积产量比去年增产34.7％。自今年6月以来，由于雨水稀少，全公社大部地区呈现旱象，其中齐心、彭圩、五十埠、谢塘四个大队水源缺乏，有五千八百多亩中稻无水灌溉。公社党委对此情况进行了研究，本着最合理最有效的用水原则，统一安排了水源，按照地形调整了灌溉系统，充分发挥了现有水库和大塘坝的效用，并进行了大队与大队、小队与小队之间的水源余缺调剂，童洼、蛟头背等五个水库，通过开沟引水，把灌区由一万五千多亩扩大到两万零五百亩，解决了三个大队水源不足的困难。如馆驿大队童洼水库，蓄水多，保证原灌区丰收有余，而五十埠大队及方岗大队的部分地区因地势高、塘坝少，缺乏水源；在去年抗旱中虽然开展了协作，但是由于受农业社规模小等条件的限制，水源未能充分利用。今年在公社党委统一领导安排下，通过双方协商，整修和开通了渠道，将童洼水库的水引到十多里路外，解决了五十埠、方岗大队一千四百多亩中稻田的灌溉问题。当源源不断的碧水流入干涸的农田时，这两个大队的社员情绪十分振奋。他们说：“水是公社化带来的，黄金白银也买不来”，
  “公社威力大，天崩地塌也不怕”。
    这个公社在统一安排水源、调剂水源余缺的同时，还根据抗旱和生产需要，进行了物力、人力的等价交换、互助协作。全社一万二千多名劳力分成“双抢”、抗旱两条战线作战，并根据各人的技术、特长、体力强弱，进行了细致的分工，组织了各种专业队、组，采取包任务、包质量、包时间、包工分的办法，大大提高了工效，解决了劳力不足的困难，使“双抢”、抗旱得以齐头并进。已经收割的八千多亩早稻，有二千四百亩经过抗旱复种了晚秋，在旱情严重的大队和小队，劳力和工具都显得不足，公社根据抗旱的需要，组织大队与大队、小队与小队之间开展工具、劳力的协作。在分级管理的基础上，协作采取换工、记工和等价交换的办法。小队与小队之间的协作，按照劳动定额，评工记分，统一在分配中处理；大队与大队之间的协作，按照受益田亩负担，如一方受益，一方不受益，则由受益大队记工，以后还工或秋后付给工资。这样既协作，又互利，使人力、物力都能最及时、最有效地利用到抗旱上去。公社根据这个原则，从旱情较轻的中派、灯塔等六个大队抽调了六百五十个劳力和九十张水车，支援彭圩等四个地势高、水源少、开渠任务大、提水扬程高的大队，使这些严重干旱地区的禾苗迅速得到解救。
    公社人多势大，在抗旱中还突击完成了高级社所不能完成的巨大工程。这个公社为了解决缺乏水源地区的灌溉问题，在县委的支持下，突击建成一座三级电力灌溉站。公社从灯塔等七个大队统一组织了二千四百多名抗旱大军，在几天内修挖了十余华里的干渠，目前已可进行两级提水灌溉一万零二百多亩田；全部完工后可解决七个大队两万亩田的灌溉问题。其中光荣大队有三百六十亩高塝田，用水车需要三十六级车才能提上水，现在能自流灌溉，社员们说：“不是公社化，哪来电力灌溉！”
    为了适应抗旱的需要，公社还统一筹集器材，调配工匠，突击赶制和修配水车五百多张，及时武装了抗旱大军。同时，公社化后公共福利事业的发展，使妇女摆脱了家务重担，无牵无挂地从事生产，全社六千多名妇女劳力都投入了抗旱和“双抢”，与男社员并肩作战。
    人民公社在抗旱斗争中显示出巨大威力，更加鼓舞了广大社员的冲天干劲。8月5日以前，全社已经提水解救了水稻一万八千多亩，旱粮三千九百多亩。
