Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 20th: Panmunjom News: At the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting held today, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, once again listed a large number of facts exposing the US side's consistent violations of the armistice agreement. He also pointed out that the US side should immediately withdraw the atomic weapons and missiles illegally brought into South Korea, along with the US imperialist aggressor troops, from South Korea.

At the meeting, Zhu Changjun pointed out that the US side violated the armistice agreement by forcibly detaining a large number of captured personnel from the Korean-Chinese side and obstructing the return to their hometowns of displaced civilians from the Korean-Chinese side who were abducted by the US side during the war. In addition, the US side also violated the armistice agreement by obstructing the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, restricting the freedom of the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and finally even expelling the neutral nations inspection teams from South Korea. More seriously, the US side unilaterally abolished Paragraph 13(b) of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of the entry of reinforcing combat materials from outside Korea, and then illegally transported atomic weapons and missiles into South Korea, reorganizing the US troops invading Korea into atomic divisions. The US side has also continuously and stubbornly rejected a series of peaceful proposals from the Korean-Chinese side aimed at achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea and promoting mutual contact between the people of North and South Korea and the relief of unemployed people in South Korea.

Major General Zhu Changjun also listed specific facts to condemn the US side's violations of the armistice agreement, such as continuously sending military aircraft to intrude into the airspace over the Korean-Chinese side's area to carry out hostile actions, carrying out armed attacks on the Korean-Chinese side's civil police in the demilitarized zone, and continuously sending special agents to the Korean-Chinese side's area. Major General Zhu Changjun finally pointed out that all historical facts have proven that the US side does not care about the observance and implementation of the armistice agreement; the US side has no sincerity and no consultation in handling violations of the armistice agreement; the US side uses the Military Armistice Commission as an anti-communist propaganda forum in order to achieve sinister political goals, and the US side also insists on opposing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue required by the armistice agreement.

Today's meeting was proposed by the US side. At the meeting, the US side once again falsely accused the Korean-Chinese side's aircraft of "attacking" the US Navy patrol plane; and handed over a letter from "United Nations Commander-in-Chief" Magruder to the Korean-Chinese side. Major General Zhu Changjun solemnly pointed out at the meeting that this accusation by the US side is completely fabricated.

    美方一贯违反朝鲜停战协定
    朝中方面列举事实痛予揭露
    新华社平壤20日电　板门店消息：在今天举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将再一次列举大量事实揭露了美方一贯违反停战协定的行为，并且指出，美方应该立即将非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器和导弹等连同美帝国主义侵略军一起撤出南朝鲜。
    朱昌骏少将在会上指出，美方违反停战协定强迫扣留了大量朝中方面被俘人员，阻挠在战争时期被美方劫走的朝中方面失所平民返回家乡。此外，美方还违反停战协定阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作，限制中立国监察委员会人员的自由，最后甚至把中立国视察小组逐出南朝鲜。更严重的是，美方片面废除了朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项关于禁止自朝鲜境外进入增援性作战物资的规定，并且随即非法运入原子武器和导弹，将侵朝美军改编为原子师。美方还不断地、固执地拒绝朝中方面旨在实现朝鲜和平统一、促进南北朝鲜人民相互接触和救济南朝鲜失业者的一系列和平倡议。
    朱昌骏少将还列举具体事实，谴责美方不断派遣军用飞机侵入朝中方面地区上空进行敌对行为，在非军事区内对朝中方面民政警察进行武装袭击，以及不断向朝中方面地区派遣特务等违反停战协定的行为。朱昌骏少将最后指出，一切历史事实已经证明，美方毫不关心停战协定的遵守和实施；美方在处理违反停战协定事件时毫无诚意和毫不协商；美方为了达到阴险的政治目的而把军事停战委员会当作反共宣传讲坛，美方还坚持反对停战协定所要求的朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    今天的会议是由美方建议召开的。美方在会上再次诬指朝中方面飞机“袭击”了美方海军巡逻机；并且把“联合国军总司令”马格鲁德的一封信交给朝中方面。朱昌骏少将在会上严正地指出，美方这种指控完全是无中生有。
