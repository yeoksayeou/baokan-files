Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The Chinese Political Science and Law Society held a reception this evening to warmly welcome the Japanese Legal Delegation.

Wu Defeng, Vice President of the Political Science and Law Society, and Nogukazu Nagano, head of the Japanese Legal Delegation, delivered speeches at the reception. They emphasized the need to further strengthen the friendship between legal workers and the people of China and Japan, and strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, which has undermined normal relations between the two countries.

In his welcoming speech, Wu Defeng declared: If the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its attitude of following the American imperialists and being hostile to the Chinese people, normal relations between China and Japan cannot be restored, and the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations can absolutely not be improved.

Wu Defeng sternly denounced the Kishi Nobusuke clique's current nefarious activities of further colluding with the United States and stepping up the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." He pointed out: If the US-Japan reactionaries' plot to revise the "Security Treaty" succeeds, Japan will become a US nuclear war base in the Far East. Not only will Japan once again suffer the disaster of atomic warfare, but also the peace of Asia and the security of China will be seriously threatened. In his speech, Wu Defeng expressed warm praise for the Japanese people's struggle for peace, democracy, and independence, and against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty." He also mentioned the beneficial contributions made by many people in the Japanese legal profession in the struggle for the "Matsukawa Incident," which achieved a certain victory.

In his speech, delegation leader Nogukazu Nagano expressed regret over Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards China, saying: "Because Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, one of the top responsible figures of World War II, has adopted an unfriendly policy towards China, the relationship between Japan and China has fallen into an extremely abnormal state. This has hindered the friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries." He said that the Japanese people's criticism of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is growing, and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's attempt to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" has been opposed by the majority of the Japanese people.

Nagano Nogukazu pointed out that the negotiations on revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" have increased the danger of Japan being nuclear-armed, and increased the threat to the Asian region and world peace. He also stated that Japanese legal workers will strive to further eliminate obstacles hindering the normalization of relations between Japan and China in the future.

In his speech, Nagano Nogukazu mentioned that yesterday the Japanese Supreme Court revoked the second instance judgment against the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and remanded it for retrial. He said that the strong public opinion around the world has given the Japanese people great strength, prompting the Japanese Supreme Court to make some changes. He expressed deep gratitude for the support from all over the world.

Attending the reception were Bao Erhan, Zhang Zhiran, and Zhang Youyu, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Political Science and Law Society, Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, heads of relevant people's organizations in our country, and people from the political and legal circles and well-known social figures in the capital.

　　我政法学会招待日本法律界代表团
　　一致谴责岸信介政府敌视中国
    新华社11日讯　中国政治法律学会今天晚上举行招待会，热烈欢迎日本法律界代表团。
    政法学会副会长吴德峰和日本法律界代表团团长野国助先后在招待会上致词。他们强调要进一步加强中日两国法律工作者和两国人民之间的友谊，并且严厉斥责岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，这种政策破坏了中日两国之间的正常关系。
    吴德峰在致欢迎词中宣称：岸信介政府不改变其追随美帝国主义者、敌视中国人民的态度，中日两国的正常关系便无法恢复，中日关系的僵局绝对无法改善。
    吴德峰严厉斥责岸信介集团目前进一步勾结美国，加紧修改日美“安全条约”的罪恶勾当。他指出：如果美日反动派修改“安全条约”的阴谋得逞，日本将成为美国在远东的核战争的基地，不仅日本将再一次遭受原子战争的灾害，而且亚洲的和平和中国的安全也将受到严重的威胁。吴德峰在致词中对日本人民要求和平、民主与独立以及反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争，表示热烈的赞扬。他还谈到，在获得一定胜利的“松川事件”的斗争中，日本法律界许多人士所作的有益贡献。
    长野国助团长在致词中对岸信介敌视中国的政策表示遗憾，他说：“由于第二次世界大战最高负责人之一的岸信介首相对中国采取非友好的政策，使日中两国的关系陷于极端不正常的状态。因此妨碍了两国人民的友好关系。”他说，日本国民对岸信介内阁的批评日益高涨，岸信介内阁修改日美“安全条约”的企图，已遭到多数日本国民的反对。
    长野国助指出，关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，增加了使日本进行核武装的危险性，增加了对亚洲地区和世界和平的威胁。他还表示，日本法律工作者今后将为进一步消除阻挠日中两国关系正常化的障碍而努力。
    长野国助在讲话中谈到昨天日本最高裁判所撤销对“松川事件”被告的第二审判决并且发回更审。他说，全世界强大舆论给予了日本人民很大力量，促使日本最高裁判所不得不有所改变。他对全世界的支援表示深厚的谢意。
    出席招待会的，有中国政治法律学会副会长包尔汉、张志让、张友渔，中国红十字会总会会长李德全，我国有关人民团体的负责人及首都政法界人士和著名社会人士。
