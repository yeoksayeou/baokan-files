Xinhua News Agency, 20th: On the steel industry front in August, thanks to the criticism of the right-leaning complacency of a small number of cadres, the vigorous launch of mass emulation campaigns, and the strengthening of enterprise management, the movement to increase production and practice economy with the goal of high yield, high quality, and low cost has entered a new upsurge. In the first half of the month, the national steel production level rose steadily in the three five-day periods. Taking the output of steel, iron, and steel products in the first five-day period as 100, the second five-day period had already risen to 105.1, 102.3, and 116.1 respectively; the third five-day period further rose to 117.4, 107.1, and 121.9, with the output of steel and steel products creating the highest daily production record since the beginning of this year. In the steel capital of Anshan, the vast number of workers were in high spirits and full of fighting will. The steel output in the first half of August increased by 2.8% compared to the same period in July. After the workers of the thirteen steel rolling mills issued a proposal to steel rolling mills across the country to increase production by 100,000 tons of steel in the third quarter, they got off to a flying start in the first half of the month, completing the state plan ahead of schedule and producing more than 15,000 tons of steel for the state. Shanghai's steel plants, whose steel output is second only to Anshan, increased their steel output in the first half of August by 31.8% compared to the same period in July. The steel output of other key iron and steel enterprises has also increased to varying degrees. Among them, the steel output of Tangshan, Daye, Beijing, and Tianjin steel plants in the third five-day period of August increased by 35% to 68% compared to the first five-day period. The quality of steel products has also been further improved. According to statistics up to August 10, the quality of steel and pig iron in major iron and steel enterprises across the country has improved, and the pass rate of pig iron in Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces has reached more than 90%.
    The first characteristic of the new upsurge is that thousands of steel workers have quickly plunged into the lively and heated labor emulation campaign. In key enterprises in Anshan, Shanghai, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Benxi, Dalian, and other places, inter-factory collaboration competitions and head-to-head competitions between furnaces and between shifts have been widely carried out. Through inter-factory collaboration competitions, workers in Anshan's factories and mines have greatly promoted the communist style of collaboration in production: workers in mining, sintering, chemical, transportation, and other units have tried their best to create good raw material conditions for ironmaking plants; ironworkers have done everything possible to ensure the supply of a large quantity and high-quality molten iron to steelworkers; steelworkers have strived to provide the blooming mills with a sufficient quantity of hot steel ingots. Therefore, in this steel capital that is watched by the people of the whole country, good news of production has been frequently reported in the past half month. The head-to-head competition among large blast furnaces across the country for producing more high-quality pig iron is also in full swing. In July, the workers of Anshan's No. 3 blast furnace, with excellent production results, seized the championship red flag from the workers of No. 9 blast furnace. Then, they issued a battle letter to the workers of No. 9 blast furnace, determined to win another victory in production in August and maintain their honor. The workers of No. 9 blast furnace did not show weakness and also proposed to surpass No. 3 blast furnace in August and regain the red flag. Like the workers of these two blast furnaces, the workers of large blast furnaces across the country are all showing their talents.
    Another characteristic of the new upsurge is that many iron and steel enterprises have mobilized the vast number of workers to discuss the production tasks for August, September, and the next five months, analyze the key problems in current production, and formulate practical and feasible technical measures. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company held a technical representative meeting, deciding to further promote various advanced experiences, launch a technical revolution upsurge, and put forward the slogan of blast furnaces catching up with Benxi (Iron and Steel Company), open-hearth furnaces surpassing Tianjin (Steel Plant) and catching up with Anshan, and electric furnaces catching up with Benxi (Iron and Steel Company). In order to increase pig iron production, the company is taking measures such as water-selecting ore powder, grading coking coal, and increasing the production of sintered ore, and is promoting advanced experiences such as multi-nozzle combustion in hot blast stoves and double-row air vents. Many enterprises and provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have also been further promoting the production experience and technical measures of blast furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces that have already been summarized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry since the beginning of the month.
    Some key iron-producing provinces and cities are doing everything possible to increase the output and quality of pig iron. The measures taken by Shandong Province include: (1) tapping the potential of existing blast furnaces that are in operation and increasing the number of blast furnaces that have not yet been put into operation; (2) conscientiously implementing the principle that coking coal must be washed and selected to improve coke quality; (3) strengthening the work of making sintered ore and artificial rich ore by indigenous methods to increase the iron content of iron ore; (4) accelerating the technical transformation to increase the air volume and air temperature of small blast furnaces. Sichuan, Hebei, and other provinces have also taken emergency measures to increase pig iron production. The basic construction projects necessary for ironmaking are being constructed at full speed throughout the region. The first medium-sized blast furnace in Jiangsu Province has recently been put into production in Nanjing. The construction projects of medium-sized blast furnaces in Handan and Longyan in Hebei, Banshan in Zhejiang, and Ma'anshan in Anhui are either nearing completion or are being installed at an accelerated pace, and will also be put into production one after another. Among the key enterprises, the ore dressing project of Anshan's Gongchangling and the ore dressing plant and sintering plant of Wuhan Iron and Steel are under construction in full swing.
    Amid the frequent sounds of drums beating for production competitions, leading cadres of iron and steel enterprises in Anshan, Shanghai, Dalian, Benxi, Shijingshan, Daye, Jiangsu, and other places have stepped out of their offices and gone deep into workshops and furnaces to discover and solve problems in production in a timely manner. The vast majority of party committee secretaries and factory directors in Anshan take turns in three shifts to direct production on site. After leading cadres of Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant went deep into the scene, they held discussions with workshop cadres and workers to conduct operational experiments and promptly solved the problem of the converter's furnace life declining for a time.

　　克服右倾松劲情绪　高产优质红旗飘飘
    全国钢铁生产步步高升
　　八月第三个五天比第一个五天
    钢：　提高　17.4％
　　生铁：提高　7.1％
　　钢材：提高　21.9％
    新华社20日讯　8月份的钢铁工业战线，由于批判了一小部分干部的右倾松劲思想，大搞群众竞赛运动和加强企业管理，以高产、优质、低成本为目标的增产节约运动进入了一个新的高潮。上半月的三个五天，全国钢铁生产水平步步高升。如果以第一个五天的钢、铁和钢材产量各为一百，第二个五天已上升为一零五点一、一零二点三、一一六点一；第三个五天又上升为一一七点四、一零七点一、一二一点九，其中钢和钢材产量创造了今年以来最高日产纪录。在钢都鞍山，广大职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，8月上半月钢产量比7月同期提高了2.8％；十三个轧钢厂的职工，向全国轧钢厂发出了在第三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议后，上半月旗开得胜，提前完成了国家计划，并给国家多生产了一万五千多吨钢材。钢产量仅次于鞍钢的上海各钢厂，8月上半月钢产量比7月同期提高了31.8％。其他各重点钢铁企业的钢产量，也都程度不同地提高了。其中唐山、大冶、北京和天津各钢厂，8月第三个五天的钢产量比第一个五天提高了35％到68％。钢铁产品的质量也有进一步提高，到8月10日为止的统计，全国主要钢铁企业的钢和生铁质量都有提高，江苏、河南、山西等省生铁的合格率都达到了90％以上。
    新高潮的第一个特点是，成千上万的钢铁工人迅速投入了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。在鞍山、上海、重庆、太原、本溪、大连等地重点企业，广泛开展了厂际协作竞赛和炉与炉、班与班之间的对手竞赛。鞍钢各厂矿职工通过厂际协作竞赛，生产上大兴共产主义协作之风：采矿、烧结、化工、运输等单位职工，千方百计地为炼铁厂创造良好的原料条件；炼铁工人尽一切力量保证供应炼钢工人数量多、质量好的铁水；炼钢工人争取一切可能给初轧厂提供数量充足的热钢锭。因此，这个全国人民瞩目的钢都，半个月来频传生产捷报。全国大型高炉之间为多产优质生铁的对手竞赛，也进行得酣热。7月份，鞍钢三号高炉职工，以优异的生产成绩，从九号高炉职工手里夺取了冠军优胜红旗。接着，他们向九号高炉职工打下战表，决心在8月份生产上再打胜仗，保住荣誉。九号高炉职工并不示弱，也提出要在8月份赛过三号高炉，夺回红旗。像这两个高炉职工一样，全国大型高炉的职工都在大显身手。
    新高潮的另一个特点是，许多钢铁企业发动广大职工，讨论了8、9月和今后五个月的生产任务，分析了当前生产上的关键问题，制订了切实可行的技术措施。太原钢铁公司召开了技术代表会议，决定进一步推广各种先进经验，掀起技术革命高潮，并提出高炉赶本溪（钢铁公司），平炉超天津（钢厂）、赶鞍钢，电炉赶本溪（钢铁公司）的口号。为了提高生铁生产，这个公司正在采取水选矿粉、焦煤分级、增产烧结矿等措施，推广热风炉多嘴燃烧和双排风口等先进经验。许多企业和省、市、自治区，从上旬起，也都在进一步推广已经由冶金工业部总结出来的高炉、转炉、电炉的生产经验和技术措施。
    一些重点产铁的省、市，正在千方百计地提高生铁的产量和质量。山东省采取的措施有：（一）发挥现有开工生产的高炉的潜力，增开尚未开工的高炉；（二）认真贯彻执行炼焦煤必须洗选的原则，改善焦炭质量；（三）加强土法烧结矿石和人造富矿的工作，提高铁矿石含铁量；（四）加速为提高小高炉风量、风温的技术改造。四川、河北等省也采取了紧急措施增产生铁。各地对炼铁必需的基本建设工程，正在快马加鞭地施工。江苏省第一座中型高炉，最近已在南京投入生产，河北邯郸和龙烟、浙江半山、安徽马鞍山等地中型高炉的建设工程，有的已在结尾，有的正在加速安装，也将陆续投入生产。重点企业中如鞍钢弓长岭的选矿工程和武钢的选矿厂、烧结厂都在加紧施工。
    在生产竞赛鼙鼓频敲声中，鞍山、上海、大连、本溪、石景山、大冶、江苏等地钢铁企业的领导干部纷纷走出办公室，深入车间、炉旁，及时发现和解决生产中的问题。鞍钢绝大部分的党委书记、厂长分三班轮流在现场指挥生产。上海第五钢铁厂的领导干部深入现场后，跟车间干部、工人一起开座谈会，进行操作试验，及时解决了转炉炉龄一度下降的问题。
