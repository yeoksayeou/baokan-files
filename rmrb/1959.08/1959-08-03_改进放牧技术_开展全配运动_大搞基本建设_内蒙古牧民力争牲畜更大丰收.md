Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 2nd. Having just achieved a bumper harvest in animal husbandry, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, under the slogan of "Celebrating the Bumper Harvest, Boosting Enthusiasm, Adding One More Head of Livestock, and Adding One More Share of Wealth to the Country," have launched a new upsurge in animal husbandry production to strive for an even greater harvest next year.
    In order to make the livestock fat and plump, the people's communes in the agricultural and pastoral areas of the Ulanqab League, while focusing on fattening, mobilized the masses at all levels from the commune to the management area, relying on the masses, to offer suggestions and improve grazing techniques. More than 300,000 head of livestock of the Balinyou Banner that "walked the Aoteer" (pastoral system following the grass growth) generally had better condition than in previous years due to the selection of pastures with lush water and grass and the extension of grazing time.
    A region-wide campaign for full mating and full pregnancy of breeding female animals is vigorously underway. Hulunbuir, Zhaowuda, Xilingol, and Yikezhao Leagues have all held meetings to further strengthen the leadership of this campaign. The herdsmen of Ongniud Banner have carried out pregnancy checks on early-bred female animals and have taken various measures to re-mate empty and missed matings.
    Xilingol, Zhaowuda, Ulanqab, and other pastoral areas are vigorously developing basic pastoral construction work such as water conservancy and building sheds and pens in pastoral areas. Eight pastoral communes in Ongniud Banner, Zhaowuda League, have launched a competition in basic pastoral construction work. At present, the banner has built more than 3,400 new livestock sheds and pens and 147 new drinking wells in pastures. Balinyou Banner, which has been carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects, currently has more than 110 water wells under construction. This year, the banner will achieve an average of one well every five miles, all equipped with water lifting tools. Xilingol League started a league-wide shed and pen construction campaign on July 1st. At present, more than 30% of the labor force and more than 5,000 carts have been put into this work.
    Now, from Hulunbuir to Bayannur, on the thousand-mile prairie, herdsmen are waving scythes, driving tractors, horse-drawn mowing machines, and raking machines, and are fighting hard to store 10 billion catties of fodder for the wintering livestock.
    Many communes and herdsmen are also actively developing diversified sideline production activities such as raising pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits, planting feed and vegetables, and hunting. Herdsmen use large amounts of vegetables, fresh eggs, and poultry to replace some livestock as food, in order to improve their meals and reduce livestock consumption. A new atmosphere of diligence and thrift has emerged in all pastoral areas. (Attached picture)

### 改进放牧技术　开展全配运动　大搞基本建设  内蒙古牧民力争牲畜更大丰收

    改进放牧技术　开展全配运动　大搞基本建设
    内蒙古牧民力争牲畜更大丰收
    据新华社呼和浩特2日电　刚刚获得了畜牧业大丰收的内蒙古各族牧民，在“庆丰收，鼓干劲，多增加一头牲畜，多为国家增添一分财富”的口号下，掀起了争取明年更大丰收的畜牧业生产新高潮。
    乌兰察布盟农牧区各人民公社为使牲畜膘满肉肥，在抓膘中，从公社到管理区，层层发动群众，依靠群众，献计献策，改进放牧技术。巴林右旗走“敖特尔”的三十多万头牲畜，由于选择了水草丰美的牧场和延长放牧时间，牲畜膘情普遍比往年好。
    自治区各地的适龄母畜全配全孕运动，正在蓬勃开展。呼伦贝尔、昭乌达、锡林郭勒和伊克昭等盟，都召开了会议，进一步加强了对这个运动的领导。翁牛特旗的牧民对早期配种的母畜实行了妊娠检查，对空怀和漏配的母畜采取了各种办法补配。
    锡林郭勒、昭乌达、乌兰察布等盟牧区，大搞牧区水利和修棚搭圈等牧业基本建设工作。昭乌达盟翁牛特旗的八个牧业公社，在牧业基本建设工作中展开了竞赛。现在，全旗已经新搭盖牲畜棚圈三千四百多处，新建牧场饮水井一百四十七眼。大修水利的巴林右旗，目前又有一百一十多眼水井在紧张动工。今年，全旗要达到平均五里有一口井，全部安装提水工具。锡林郭勒盟从7月1日开始，开展了全盟范围的棚圈建设工作。目前，全盟有30％多的劳动力和五千多辆大车投入了这项工作。
    现在，从呼伦贝尔到巴彦淖尔千里草原上，牧民们挥舞着镰刀，驾驶着拖拉机、马拉打草机和搂草机，正在为过冬牲畜贮备一百亿斤饲草而紧张地战斗着。
    许多公社和牧民还积极开展饲养猪、鸡、鸭、兔，种植饲料、蔬菜，以及狩猎等多种副业生产活动。牧民们用大量的蔬菜、鲜蛋和家禽代替部分牲畜作为食品，以改善伙食并且减少牲畜的消耗量。各个牧区普遍出现了勤俭持家的新风气。（附图片）
