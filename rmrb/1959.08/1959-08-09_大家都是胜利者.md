    "Everyone is a Winner"
    As the Seventh World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival was being enthusiastically held in Vienna, the capital of Austria, the Soviet color documentary "The Beginning of Youth" was being screened in our capital. This film, documenting the Third International Youth Friendship Games, attracted the attention of the audience. Although it happened two years ago, the film still evokes our yearning for peace and friendship among international youth.
    Athletes from forty-six countries gathered in Moscow. On the sports field, youthful ranks displayed strength, and flowers of friendship bloomed. The film reported on the grand occasion of the festival, and the new records and excellent results created by the athletes. Tense and fierce track and field competitions, wonderful diving performances, graceful gymnastics, and strong weightlifting... all of these were so fascinating. However, the most precious thing in the film was the pure friendship. Although people have different beliefs, different nationalities, and different languages, everyone's desire for peace and friendship is the same. At this sports meet, who is the winner of the competition? The film says, "Everyone is a winner!" Indeed, people have overcome various obstacles and barriers, and jointly obtained precious friendship, everyone is a winner!

    “大家都是胜利者”
    当第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节在奥地利首都维也纳热烈举行着的时候，我国首都的银幕上正在放映苏联彩色记录片“青春时代的开始”。这部纪录第三届国际青年友谊运动会的片子，吸引着观众们的注意。这虽说是两年以前的事情了，但影片仍然引起我们对国际青年之间的和平和友谊的向往。
    四十六个国家的运动员代表聚集在莫斯科。运动场上青春的行列在显示着力量，友谊的花朵盛开着。影片报道了节日的盛况，报道了运动员们创造的各项新纪录和优异成绩。紧张、激烈的田径赛，精采的跳水表演，优美的体操、健壮的举重……这些都那么引人入胜。但是，影片中最珍贵的还是那种纯真的友情。尽管人们的信仰不同、民族不同、语言不同、大家对和平和友谊的愿望却是相同的。在这个运动会上，谁是竞赛的胜利者呢？影片说“大家都是胜利者！”不错，人们战胜了各种阻挠和隔阂，共同获得了珍贵的友情，大家都是胜利者！　（林）
