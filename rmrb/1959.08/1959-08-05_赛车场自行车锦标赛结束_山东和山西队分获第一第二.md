Over the three days of competition, the Shandong men's and women's cycling teams secured first place overall, followed by Shanxi in second place and Beijing in third.

	The Shandong women's cycling team, composed of three middle school students – Zhao Xiangfen (19 years old), Cui Yuqin (18 years old), and Xu Suzhen (17 years old) – clinched the championship in the women's 4,000-meter team pursuit race today with a combined time of 19 minutes 2.3 seconds. The Shandong and Shanxi women's teams competed in the same group. At the start of the race, the two teams departed simultaneously from different starting points on opposite sides of the track. By the finish line, the three physically strong Shandong female athletes had overtaken the Shanxi cyclists by nearly a lap (each rider had to complete twelve laps).

	The Beijing women's team secured second place in this event. This team consists of three female workers – Ma Shuqin (24 years old), Su Shunhua (22 years old), and Ma Wenpin (18 years old), with a time of 19 minutes 5.7 seconds.

	The Shanxi male athletes and Shandong female athletes have only been formally practicing cycling for a little over half a year, but their progress has been exceptionally rapid.

Wang Erzhu and Li Yongzhi from the Shanxi men's team won the championship and fifth place, respectively, in the men's 1,000-meter race. Additionally, Li Yongzhong and Long Qilan secured second and fourth place, respectively, in the men's 2,000-meter race.
