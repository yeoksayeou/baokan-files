Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 16th: The German Democratic Republic's Third National Games victoriously concluded in Leipzig on the evening of the 16th. The extensive mass participation of this Games left a deep impression on people.

This Games attracted more than 170,000 athletes and spectators from all over the country. More than 18,000 people from West Germany also visited. A total of 36,000 people participated in various group exercises.

Many new achievements emerged at the Third National Games. In the swimming championships, there was one European record and twelve all-German records. K. Enke set a European record of 2 minutes and 38.6 seconds in the 200-meter breaststroke. Two all-German records were also set in cycling. In athletics, despite the impact of the weather, the results of the men's triple jump and women's long jump both broke all-German records.

Many champions are rising stars. For example, Ingrid Schmidt, the women's 100-meter backstroke champion, is only thirteen years old, and her time is 1 minute 15.4 seconds. The runner-up, Heidi Eisenschmidt, is only fifteen years old. Fifteen-year-old Frank Wiegand won the men's 400-meter freestyle with a time of 4 minutes 40 seconds.

Compared with the West German athletics competition held in Stuttgart two weeks ago, the German Democratic Republic had higher results than West Germany in six championship events, equal results with West Germany in two events (high jump and 200-meter race), and lower results than West Germany in only two events (400-meter hurdles and long jump).

Rudi Reiderdt, Chairman of the German Sports and Gymnastics Association, said in evaluating this Games that it fully demonstrates the high achievements of the German Democratic Republic's truly people's sports.

　　德意志民主共和国三届全运会闭幕
　　多项比赛成绩超过西德
    据新华社柏林16日电　德意志民主共和国第三届全国运动大会16日晚在来比锡胜利闭幕。这届运动会的广泛群众性留给人们深刻的印象。
    这届运动会吸引了来自全国各地的十七万多名运动员和观众。西德也有一万八千多人参观。参加各种团体操表演的共有三万六千人。
    第三届全国运动大会上出现了许多新成绩。在游泳锦标赛中，出现了一项欧洲纪录和十二个全德纪录。康·恩克以二分三十八点六秒创二百米蛙泳欧洲纪录。在自行车比赛中也出现了两个全德纪录。在田径方面，尽管受到天气的影响，男子三级跳和女子跳远两项比赛的成绩都打破了全德纪录。
    许多冠军都是后起之秀。如，女子百米仰泳冠军英格里德·施密特才十三岁，她的成绩是一分十五秒四，亚军海迪·艾森施密特只有十五岁。十五岁的弗兰克·维甘特以四分四十秒的成绩取得男子四百米自由式第一名。
    同两星期前在斯图加特举行的西德田径赛相比较，德意志民主共和国有六项冠军的成绩在西德以上，两项（跳高和二百米赛跑）的成绩与西德相等，只有四百米低栏和跳远两项成绩还低于西德。
    德国体育和运动协会主席鲁迪·赖德尔特在评价这次运动会时说，它充分显示了德意志民主共和国的真正的人民体育的高度成就。
