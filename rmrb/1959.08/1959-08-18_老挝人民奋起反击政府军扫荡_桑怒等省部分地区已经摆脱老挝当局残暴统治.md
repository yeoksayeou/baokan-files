Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 16th: Newspapers here today published a report from the "Lao Patriotic News" of August 11th, stating that in recent times, people in many parts of Laos have risen up in self-defense, inflicting heavy blows on the Sananikone government's suppression troops, which are under the command of the United States.

　　In the twenty days from July 18th to August 7th, the people of Sam Neua, Phongsaly, Luang Prabang, and Khammouane provinces, in coordination with their armed forces, launched forty anti-suppression battles. In these battles, hundreds of kingdom soldiers were killed, wounded, and captured, and other kingdom troops rapidly disintegrated, surrendered, or fled. In a stronghold north of Luang Prabang, about seventy kingdom soldiers fled. Six kingdom army officers were killed by the people. The people's armed forces seized large quantities of weapons, ammunition, equipment, uniforms, and military supplies, and also recovered many livestock, rice, and salt that the kingdom army had looted from the people.

　　In the four provinces, the Lao Kingdom army was forced to withdraw from thirteen strongholds, and the kingdom army in another nine strongholds retreated in panic. The entire Mang San County in Sam Neua Province, most of the Chuang Khouang County and Sang Tai County, three associated villages in the So Sang area of Luang Prabang, and a part of the Mang Ngoi County in Phongsaly have shaken off the brutal rule of the Lao reactionaries.

    在7月18日至8月7日二十天中，桑怒、丰沙里、琅勃拉邦、甘蒙四省的人民协同自己的武装力量展开了四十次反扫荡的战斗。在这些战斗中，有成百名王国军队死亡、受伤和被俘，另外一些王国军队也迅速瓦解、投降或逃命。琅勃拉邦北面的一个据点，约有七十名王国军队逃跑。先后有六名王国军官被人民击毙。人民的武装力量缴获大批武器、弹药、器械、军服、军用品，还夺回了王国军队抢劫人民的许多牲畜、大米和食盐等。
    在四个省中，老挝王国军队被迫撤出十三个据点，另外九个据点的王国军队因惊慌撤退。桑怒省芒山县全县、川库县和桑代县的大部分地区，琅勃拉邦索尚地区的三个联乡，丰沙里芒莪县的一部分地区已摆脱了老挝反动派的残暴统治。
