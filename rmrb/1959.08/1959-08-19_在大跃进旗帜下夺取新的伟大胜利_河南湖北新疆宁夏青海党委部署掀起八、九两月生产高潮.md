　　Seize New Great Victories Under the Banner of the Great Leap Forward
　　Henan, Hubei, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Qinghai Party Committees Deploy Efforts to Launch Production Upsurge in August and September

　　This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 18th: Recently, Party organizations at all levels in Henan Province, based on the deployment of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, have focused on the work of August and September, launched a movement to oppose right-leaning emotions and practice strict increase in production and economy, so that a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production has immediately appeared in the province. On the industrial front, the output of iron and steel and coal has been rising steadily. The average daily output of coal in the first four days of mid-August increased by 16% compared with the first ten days of the month, and the output of pig iron increased by 35%, and the pass rate of iron reached more than 86%. On the agricultural front, the daily progress of drought resistance and irrigation has now risen to 6.8 million mu, an increase of 20% compared with the highest daily progress in the previous period. Now, all localities are continuing to work hard to create greater achievements and welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
　　Recently, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of industrial secretaries of prefectural and municipal committees, and then convened a meeting of first secretaries to seriously study the current situation, analyze the ideological trends inside and outside the Party, seriously criticize the right-leaning emotions that are growing among some cadres, and, on the basis of unified ideological understanding, arranged the future industrial and agricultural production, and formulated targets and measures for increasing production and economy. In terms of industrial production, all enterprises are required to strive to over fulfill the annual plan by 5% to 10% without increasing equipment and raw materials, labor productivity should be increased by another 35% to 40% compared with the first half of the year, raw materials should be saved by more than 5% to 8%, and the total cost of enterprises should be reduced by another 5% to 10% compared with the first half of the year. In terms of capital construction, the progress should be accelerated, the finishing works should be seriously grasped, and they should be completed and put into production as soon as possible; and the cost should be reduced by 5% to 8% on the premise of ensuring the quality of the project. In agriculture, the struggle against drought to ensure a bumper harvest must be carried through to the end to ensure a bumper autumn harvest, and a movement to increase production and exceed production should be carried out universally. In areas with better water conservancy conditions, it is necessary to strive for further over-production and more production on the basis of the original increase in production and over-production; in general areas, efforts should also be made to add water and fertilizer to strive for a bumper harvest, and actively prepare for autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn plowing and wheat planting. The secretaries of various localities and municipalities who participated in the meeting were full of confidence in completing the various targets set by the provincial party committee.
　　After the meeting, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China successively convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, an emergency telephone conference on drought resistance to ensure a bumper harvest, and a meeting of party member leading cadres of provincial directly-affiliated agencies, requiring all localities and provincial leading departments to stand at the forefront of the movement to deeply organize the fight against right-leaning and inspire enthusiasm, and set off a greater upsurge in the movement to increase production and economy. Members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee went to various regions on the 15th to assist various localities in strengthening specific leadership over the current movement. Since the 11th, various localities and municipal party committees have successively held meetings, and have adopted the method of holding meetings well on the one hand and grasping production on the other hand, and planning and acting at the same time, and immediately implemented the spirit of the meeting into action. On the second day of the cadre meeting, more than 40 units in Anyang City revised the original low production targets.

　　This newspaper, Wuhan, 18th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently successively convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, as well as a telephone conference of secretaries of prefectural, municipal and county party committees throughout the province and a radio conference throughout the province, requiring party committees at all levels and the people of the province to work hard, seize August and September, work hard, specially hard, and cleverly, and quickly launch a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy.
　　At these meetings, the current situation in the province was analyzed, and it was believed that the current situation is very favorable. The province has achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. After more than a month of drought resistance struggle by more than 100,000 cadres and more than 7 million people, the vast majority of the 14 million mu of mid-season rice has now been rescued from the drought demon, and is undergoing large-scale harvesting. Although the serious threat of drought still continues, the vast number of farmers in the province are waging a protracted war against drought with the momentum of overturning rivers and seas and soaring enthusiasm. Good news is also constantly coming from the industrial front. The total industrial output value of the province in the first half of the year completed 52.15% of the annual plan, which is a great increase compared with the same period last year. Great achievements have also been made in the work of commerce, transportation, and other aspects.
　　The provincial party committee requires cadres at all levels and the people of the province, in terms of agriculture, to strive for a complete victory in drought resistance and ensure the realization of agricultural production increase plans. Mid-season rice should be harvested carefully and threshed carefully to ensure that every grain returns home; efforts should be made to grasp the production of late autumn crops and vegetables, and make preparations for winter sowing as soon as possible. In terms of industry, finance, trade, and transportation, the current task is to overcome the right-leaning emotions of a few cadres, mobilize the masses, carry out technical innovation, strengthen the scientific management of enterprises, and strive to comprehensively over fulfill the state plan.
　　At the provincial radio conference, the provincial party committee also called on the people of the province to learn how to live, to save money and use it sparingly. Areas with good harvests should also live rich days as poor days.

　　This newspaper, Urumqi, 18th: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a mobilization meeting of responsible cadres of party organizations of autonomous region-level and Urumqi city organs, groups, factories, mines, and enterprises on the 15th. At the meeting, Comrade Saifuddin, Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, made a report entitled "Resolutely Oppose Right-Leaning Ideology and Quickly Launch a New Upsurge of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy."
　　Comrade Saifuddin pointed out in his report: At present, the overall situation in the autonomous region, like the whole country, is good. In the first half of this year, great achievements have been made in various economic construction undertakings. On the industrial front, the total industrial output value from January to July has completed 60.7% of the annual plan, an increase of 1.1 times compared with the same period last year. In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, by mid-July, the autonomous region had reclaimed a total of 2.38 million mu of wasteland, and the sown area reached 30.97 million mu, an expansion of 4.41 million mu compared with last year. This year, summer crops, mainly wheat, have generally achieved bumper harvests, and autumn crops are also expected to have bumper harvests. The production situation of animal husbandry is also very good. By now, 6.9 million head of young livestock of various types have been produced; the survival rate of breeding is expected to reach 83.67%, which is a great increase compared with last year. The 454 people's communes in the region have been further consolidated after half a year of rectification, production has greatly developed, and collective welfare undertakings have also been greatly improved.
　　Comrade Saifuddin emphasized: At present, in some cadres in the autonomous region, right-leaning conservative ideological emotions have begun to rise again and grow. The task of the entire party in the autonomous region is to resolutely oppose right-leaning conservative ideology, continue to work hard, seize the key period of August and September, mobilize the masses, and quickly launch a comprehensive, mass-based, and vigorous new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. He required: Party organizations at all levels and units to immediately organize all cadres inside and outside the Party to study the People's Daily editorial on August 6, "Overcome Right-Leaning Emotions and Practice Strict Increase in Production and Economy"; use the fastest method to convey the spirit of opposing right-leaning ideology and inspiring enthusiasm to the masses of workers, peasants, herdsmen, and soldiers, and specifically deploy the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy to ensure the realization of various industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production targets and plans. It is necessary to do a good job in the operation and management of the people's communes and constantly give play to the great superiority of the people's communes. Whether in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, commerce, transportation, or other undertakings, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out mass movements, and complete and over fulfill production plans with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The first secretaries and other leading cadres of party committees at all levels and units should seize ideological leadership, strengthen specific guidance for production, and organize inspection groups to immediately go deep into the grassroots.

　　This newspaper, Yinchuan, 18th: On August 12, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference attended by secretaries of various localities, counties, and cities, calling on the people of the region to fight hard in August and September, oppose right-leaning conservative ideology, and push the movement to increase production and practice economy to a new upsurge.
　　The Party Committee analyzed the current situation and believed that in the first half of this year, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, the region had achieved major achievements in industry, agriculture, commerce, rectification and consolidation of people's communes, and other construction undertakings. However, a few cadres did not recognize this excellent situation and developed right-leaning emotions. If they are not overcome, they will hinder the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously and deeply criticize right-leaning ideology and unswervingly implement the general line of socialist construction.
　　In order to oppose right-leaning conservatism, boost enthusiasm, and push the movement to increase production and practice economy to a new upsurge, the Ningxia Party Committee issued instructions to the county and city party committees on August 14, making specific deployments, instructing and requiring party organizations at all levels to organize party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and the broad masses of cadres to seriously study the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Emotions and Practice Strict Increase in Production and Economy," check the understanding and implementation of the general line, summarize experiences and lessons, and propose specific measures for improvement. At the same time, in conjunction with the current central work, extensively and deeply carry out ideological education on the general line of socialist construction among the masses, and immediately launch a vigorous and down-to-earth movement to compare with, learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced, and constantly improve labor productivity, and strive to comprehensively complete and over fulfill this year's production plan. The instructions pointed out: All localities should further verify production targets in the spirit of combining boosting enthusiasm and seeking truth from facts, and study specific measures with the masses to strive to over fulfill the plan, seize the current favorable opportunity, mobilize the masses to offer suggestions and strategies, and make the greatest efforts to turn the plan into reality. At the same time, it is necessary to overcome the thinking of some cadres who are tied up and afraid to take bold responsibility, and promote the spirit of hard work, practical work, clever work, and a revolutionary character of high responsibility for the people's cause.

　　This newspaper, Xining, 18th: The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China successively convened a cadre meeting in the Xining area and a provincial radio conference on the 14th and 15th, calling on the broad masses of cadres and the masses to fight against right-leaning, boost enthusiasm, fight hard for August and September, quickly launch a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy, and strive for an all-round bumper harvest in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry.
　　At the cadre meeting of industrial, transportation, capital construction and other units in the Xining area above the section chief level and the party and government trade union cadres above the factory, mine and workshop level held on the 14th, Gao Keting, member of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, made a mobilization report. He analyzed the situation of the Great Leap Forward since this year, and at the same time criticized the right-leaning emotions of a small number of cadres within the Party, calling on everyone to seriously study the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Emotions and Practice Strict Increase in Production and Economy," seize the time, and launch a greater upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy in the month and a half before the National Day. In his report, he proposed: In terms of industrial production, we should seize the production of materials needed for agricultural and animal husbandry production and the current market, and first of all, we should seize autumn plowing and wintering materials to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture and the wintering needs of the masses. Metallurgy, fuel, light industry, chemical industry, electric power, geology and other aspects should comprehensively and evenly complete the third quarter tasks, and strive for high quality and high output.
　　At the provincial radio conference on the 15th, Chen Sigong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a report at the meeting, saying: August and September are the key seasons for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry. In terms of agricultural production, we should grasp the four major tasks of summer harvest, late-stage field management, autumn plowing, and manure accumulation and fertilizer production. August, September, and October are good times to reclaim wasteland. State-owned farms should actively organize forces to make a major assault on reclaiming wasteland and building water conservancy projects. In terms of animal husbandry production, we should grasp autumn fattening, breeding, grass mowing, corral construction, and prevention and treatment of livestock diseases; we should also seize the work of shearing, livestock improvement, and building grassland water conservancy.
　　The report pointed out that the key to completing the above tasks is to oppose right-leaning, boost enthusiasm, and further launch a movement to increase production and practice economy.

　　在大跃进旗帜下夺取新的伟大胜利
　　河南湖北新疆宁夏青海党委部署掀起八、九两月生产高潮
    本报郑州18日电　河南省各级党组织最近根据中共河南省委的部署，大抓8、9月份工作，开展了反对右倾情绪、厉行增产节约的运动，使全省立即出现了工农业生产新高潮。在工业战线上，钢铁、煤炭的产量节节上升，8月中旬前四天的平均日产量同上旬比较，煤炭增长16％，生铁增长35％，并且铁的合格率达到86％以上。在农业战线上，目前抗旱浇地日进度已经上升到六百八十万亩，比前些时候最高日进度增加20％。现在，各地正继续鼓足干劲，创造更大成绩，迎接国庆十周年。
    最近，中共河南省委曾召开了地、市委工业书记会议，并接着召开了第一书记会议，认真地研究了当前的形势，分析了党内外的思想动向，严肃地批判了一部分干部正在滋长着的右倾情绪，并在统一思想认识的基础上，布置了今后的工农业生产，拟订了增产节约的指标和措施。在工业生产方面，要求各企业在不增加设备和原材料的条件下，力争全年超产5％到10％，劳动生产率要比上半年再提高35％到40％，原材料节约5％到8％以上，企业总成本比上半年再降低5％到10％。基本建设方面，要加快进度，认真抓好扫尾工程，早日建成投入生产；并且在保证工程质量的前提下，降低造价5％到8％。在农业方面，要把抗旱保丰收斗争坚持到底，确保秋季丰收，并普遍地开展增产、超产运动，水利条件比较好的地区，必须在原来增产超产的基础上，力争再超产，多增产；在一般地区，也要努力加水加肥，力争丰收，并积极做好秋收、秋种、秋耕和种麦的准备工作。参加会议的各地、市委书记对完成省委提出的各种指标都满怀信心。
    会议结束后，中共河南省委又相继召开了省委常委会议、抗旱保丰收紧急电话会议，和省直属机关党员负责干部大会，要求各地和省级领导部门站在运动前头深入地组织反右倾、鼓干劲，掀起增产节约运动的更大高潮。省委常委并于15日分赴各地区，协助各地加强对当前运动的具体领导。从11日以来，各地、市委都相继召开会议，并且采取一手开好会议，一手抓好生产和边计划、边行动的办法，立即把会议精神贯彻到行动中去。安阳市委在召开干部会议的第二天，就有四十多个单位修订了原来的偏低的生产指标。
    本报武汉18日电　中共湖北省委最近连续召开了省委常委会、省委扩大会以及全省地、市、县委书记电话会议和全省广播大会，要求各级党委和全省人民，鼓足干劲，抓紧8、9两月，大干、特干、苦干、巧干，迅速掀起增产节约的新高潮。
    在这些会议上分析了目前全省的形势，认为当前形势是很有利的。全省早稻获得丰收，一千四百万亩中稻，经过十多万干部和七百多万群众一个多月的抗旱斗争，现在已绝大部分从旱魔手中拯救出来，正在大规模开镰收割。当前干旱的严重威胁虽然还继续存在，但全省广大农民正以翻江倒海的气势和冲天干劲跟干旱作持久战。工业战线上也是捷报频传，全省上半年工业生产总值完成全年计划的52.15％，和去年同期比较大大增长了。商业、交通运输业等方面的工作，也都获得了很大成绩。
    省委要求各级干部和全省人民，在农业方面，要争取抗旱全胜，确保农业增产规划的实现。中稻要细收细打，做到颗粒回家；要大抓晚秋作物和蔬菜的生产，及早作好冬播准备。在工业、财贸、交通运输方面，目前是克服少数干部的右倾情绪，发动群众，开展技术革新，加强企业科学管理，争取全面超额完成国家计划。
    在全省广播大会上，省委还号召全省人民要学过日子，要省吃俭用，细水长流。丰收的地区也要把富日子当穷日子过。
    本报乌鲁木齐18日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会在15日召开了自治区级、乌鲁木齐市机关、团体、厂矿、企业单位党组织负责干部动员大会。在会上，自治区党委书记赛福鼎同志作了“坚决反对右倾思想，迅速掀起增产节约的新高潮”的报告。
    赛福鼎同志在报告中指出：当前，自治区和全国一样，总的形势是良好的。今年上半年各项经济建设事业都取得了巨大的成就。在工业战线上，1至7月份工业总产值已完成年度计划的60.7％，比去年同期增长了一点一倍。在农牧业方面，到7月中旬，全自治区共开荒二百三十八万亩，播种面积达到三千零九十七万亩，比去年扩大了四百四十一万亩。今年以小麦为主的夏田作物普遍获得大丰收，秋田作物丰收也大有希望。畜牧业生产情况也很好，到现在已产各种幼畜六百九十万头；繁殖成活率预计可达83.67％，比去年大为提高。全区四百五十四个人民公社，经过半年来的整顿，进一步巩固，生产大大发展了，集体的福利事业也有了很大改进。
    赛福鼎同志强调指出：目前在自治区部分干部中，右倾保守的思想情绪又开始抬头和滋长起来，自治区全党的任务，就是坚决反对右倾保守思想，继续鼓足干劲，抓紧8、9月的关键时期，发动群众，迅速掀起全面的、群众性的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动新高潮，迎接国庆十周年。他要求：各级和各单位党组织立即组织党内外全体干部学习8月6日人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论；用最快的方法把反对右倾思想和鼓干劲的精神传达到工人、农民、牧民和战士等群众中去，并具体部署开展增产节约运动，保证实现工农牧业各项生产指标与计划。要搞好人民公社的经营管理，不断地发挥人民公社的巨大优越性。无论工业、农业、牧业、商业、交通运输及其他事业，都要充分地发动群众，大搞群众运动，又多又快又好又省地完成和超额完成生产计划。各级党委和各单位党组织的第一书记及其他领导干部，都要抓紧思想领导，加强对生产的具体指导，组织检查团，立即深入基层。
    本报银川18日电　8月12日，中共宁夏回族自治区委员会召开了有各地、县市委书记参加的电话会议，号召全区人民大战8、9两月，反对右倾保守思想，把增产节约运动推向新高潮。
    党委分析了当前的形势，认为今年上半年，全区在去年大跃进的基础上，不论在工业、农业、商业、整顿巩固人民公社和其他建设事业，都取得了重大成就。但是，少数干部却没有认清这种大好形势，滋长了右倾情绪，如不加以克服，就会妨害国民经济的继续大跃进。因此必须认真深入地批判右倾思想，坚定不移地贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线。
    为了反对右倾保守，鼓足干劲，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮，宁夏党委于8月14日向各县、市委发出指示，作了具体部署，指示要求各级党组织组织党团员和广大干部群众，认真学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，检查对总路线的认识和贯彻执行情况，总结经验教训，提出改进的具体措施。同时结合当前的中心工作，在群众中广泛深入地开展社会主义建设总路线的思想教育，立即掀起一个轰轰烈烈踏踏实实的比先进学先进赶先进的运动，不断提高劳动生产率，力争全面地完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。指示中指出：各地要本着鼓足干劲和实事求是相结合的精神进一步核实生产指标，和群众一起研究出争取超额完成计划的具体措施，抓住当前的有利时机，发动群众献计献策，用最大的努力使计划变成现实。与此同时，要克服有些干部束手束脚、不敢大胆负责的思想，发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神和对人民事业高度负责的革命品质。
    本报西宁18日电　中共青海省委在14、15日先后召开西宁地区干部大会和全省广播大会，号召广大干部和群众反右倾，鼓干劲，大战8、9两个月，迅速掀起一个增产节约新高潮，力争工农牧业全面丰产丰收。
    在14日召开的西宁地区工业、交通、基本建设等单位的科处长以上和厂矿车间以上党政工团的干部大会上，中共青海省委委员、青海省副省长高克亭作动员报告。他分析了今年以来的大跃进形势，同时批判了党内一小部分干部的右倾情绪，号召大家认真学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，抓紧时间，在国庆节前的一个半月时间里，掀起增产节约的更大高潮。他在报告中提出：工业生产方面，应该抓紧为农牧业生产和当前市场需要的物资的生产，首先应抓紧秋翻和过冬物资，保证农业大丰收和群众过冬需要。冶金、燃料、轻工、化工、电力、地质等方面，都应全面均衡地完成第三季度任务，为优质、高产而努力。
    在15日全省广播大会上，省委书记陈思恭在会上作报告说：8、9两月是争取农牧业丰收的关键季节。在农业生产方面，要抓好夏收、后期田间管理、秋翻地、积肥造肥四大工作。8、9、10月是开垦荒地的大好时机，国营农场应积极组织力量大力突击，开垦荒地和兴修水利。在牧业生产方面，应抓好秋膘、配种、打草、打圈、防治畜病；对于剪毛、牲畜改良、兴修草原水利等项工作也都应抓紧进行。
    报告指出：完成上述任务的关键是反对右倾，鼓足干劲，进一步展开增产节约运动。
