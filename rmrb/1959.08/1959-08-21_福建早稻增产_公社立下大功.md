People's Communes Exert Great Power in Transforming Nature and Overcoming Disasters
    Fujian's Early Rice Production Increases: Communes Make Great Contributions
    In traditionally low-yield mountainous areas of northern and western Fujian, many communes see output increase by 20% to over 100%
    In areas severely hit by disasters, the communes' anti-disaster forces cooperate to greatly reduce losses
    Fuzhou, August 20th (report from this newspaper) – Over seven million mu of early rice in Fujian Province have been basically harvested, with most areas achieving a bumper harvest, and unit yields exceeding the bumper year of 1958. Areas with high-yield fields producing over 800 jin to over 1000 jin per mu have also emerged. In the mountainous areas of northern and western Fujian and coastal saline-alkali areas, traditionally known as "low-yield areas," the early rice output of many communes has increased by 20% to 30% to over 100% compared to last year. Only in some areas of the Jiulong River and Min River basins, which suffered severe natural disasters, has this year's early rice production been maintained or reduced.
    This year's increase in early rice production in Fujian Province vividly demonstrates the great superiority of the People's Communes in transforming natural conditions, implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, conquering natural disasters, and striving for bumper harvests.
    The power of the communes in transforming natural conditions is particularly evident. Fuding County, located on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, has thin soil and frequently suffers from typhoons, rainstorms and droughts. Before liberation, the county only planted about 2,000 mu of early rice, with an average yield of only one or two hundred jin per mu. From liberation until last year, the area planted with early rice gradually expanded to over 36,000 mu. This spring, the county again made full use of the superior conditions of people's communes, such as abundant labor, contiguous land, and unified water conservancy, and launched a mass movement to expand the area planted with early rice by converting dry land to paddy fields and single-season crops to double-season crops, further expanding the early rice area to over 49,900 mu. In the process of expanding the planting of early rice and striving for large-scale bumper harvests, under the unified arrangement and leadership of the communes, the broad masses of commune members marched towards transforming nature with full enthusiasm, overcame numerous difficulties, and achieved extraordinary bumper harvests. The unit area yield of early rice in the county increased by 29.4% compared to last year, and the total output increased by 62% compared to last year. The Nanxi Production Brigade of the Tongshan Commune, located in the mountainous area of this county, concentrated the strength of the entire brigade to transform over 20,000 mu of sandy farmland with hard soil into soft paddy fields, increasing the brigade's early rice area from 64 mu last year to 312 mu, and also increasing the unit yield by 41%. The production teams of the Hougang Brigade of the Shacheng Commune, located along the coast and mostly consisting of alkaline land, cooperated with each other, digging ponds and building canals day and night, drawing fresh water from dozens of miles away to "wash the alkali" and irrigate the fields, and hauling in "guest soil" to thicken the alkaline soil layer. At the same time, a new seawall was built to prevent the attack of sea tides and typhoons, thus increasing the total early rice output of the entire brigade by three point two times compared to 1958. The Shangying Brigade of the Xitan Commune in Zhao'an County, near the Fen Shui Guan pass on the border of Fujian and Guangdong, has 117 mu of fields distributed on the Fen Shui Guan mountains. The soil is very poor, the cultivation is extensive, and the yield has always been very low. Before liberation, each mu could not harvest even 100 jin of grain per season. After liberation, mutual aid teams and cooperatives were organized, and the yield was increased. At its highest, each mu could harvest about 500 jin. After communization last year, this brigade specially organized a production team to transform low-yield fields. According to the requirements of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, soil was deeply ploughed and fertilizer was applied according to the different soil quality and soil layer of each field, applying an average of about 100 dan of pond mud, sea fertilizer, and wall soil fertilizer per mu, improving the soil and transforming all the barren mountain fields into fertile good fields, and transplanting seedlings in a timely manner. Subsequently, according to the characteristics of many weeds and many disasters in mountain fields, field management was carefully strengthened to overcome the attack of many heavy rains, and finally a large bumper harvest of an average yield of 611 jin per mu was obtained in the low-yield mountain fields. Similar examples can be found everywhere in the original "low-yield areas."
    In June and July this year, rainstorms and mountain floods occurred from the Min River to the Ting River, the Jiulong River, the Jin River and other places. The people's communes in various places fully demonstrated their enormous combat effectiveness in fighting disasters and protecting harvests. Because of the large scale of the communes and the concentrated leadership, hundreds of thousands of anti-disaster and rescue troops were quickly organized at the beginning of the disaster and put into the battle of flood prevention and flood control. Men, women, old and young were promptly organized to help seedlings, wash seedlings, and apply additional fertilizer to promote the rapid greening and growth of crops. During the ripening period of early rice, the Longxi and Jinjiang regions and other coastal areas were continuously attacked by mountain floods, typhoons and rainstorms. The people's communes in these areas, with the support of all parties, immediately organized an anti-disaster and rush-harvesting army of millions of people and launched a "disaster resistance, rush-harvesting" campaign of quick harvesting, quick threshing and quick storage, winning back the fruits of the bumper harvest from many wind, flood and rain disasters and greatly reducing losses.

    Fuzhou, August 20th (report from this newspaper) – The Xin Xian People's Commune in Putian County, Fujian Province, exerted great power, and this year's early rice harvest was a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu of more than 13,000 mu of early rice in the entire commune increased by more than 50% compared to last year. After the summer harvest, the joy of a bumper harvest permeated everywhere, and the superiority of the people's commune was praised everywhere.
    The Xin Xian Commune is located in the mountainous area of Putian County. Most of the fields in the commune are scattered in the deep mountains and dense forests, and 70% are barren terraced fields of sandy chalky soil, which have always had very low yields. Why was such a great harvest achieved this year? As the members of the commune said: The people's commune should be given the top credit.
    The Xin Xian Commune has a wide range of production avenues. In addition to agriculture, there are also various economies such as chopping firewood, sawing boards, burning charcoal, splitting bamboo, weaving dustpans, and collecting medicinal materials. After communization, the commune is large, there are many people, and there are many projects to operate. At first glance, there are many people and many things in the commune, anyway, it's the same. However, after unified planning by the commune, a lot of labor was freed up. In the past, many diversified operations were too scattered. It was not known how much labor was spent from collecting raw materials and processing to transporting them to the market for sale. Now, each brigade has organized professional teams to operate, and operates according to plans and contracts. The entire commune can free up thousands of laborers and invest them in agricultural production. In terms of agricultural production, accumulating fertilizer, field management, or other agricultural activities, many also adopt a combination of professional team operations and mobilizing the masses to carry out surprise attacks, which not only rationally uses labor, but also ensures the quality of cultivation. Last winter, 70% of the early rice fields were deeply ploughed; after ploughing, the fields were burned and fumigated across the board, burning 50 to 70 piles per mu; after the Spring Festival, the commune members also massively composted and applied green manure. All of this was only possible after communization.
    After the establishment of the commune, the land can also be rationally managed. Most of the fields of the Xin Xian Commune's major brigades are scattered in the deep mountains, intertwined with each other, and far from the village. In the past, because it was time-consuming to travel back and forth and inconvenient to manage, many good fields were planted with single-season rice, the cultivation was extensive, and the yield was very low. After communization, the major brigades and production teams negotiated and resolved the problem of inter-planting land based on the principle of benefiting production. The Xin Xian Brigade and the Ke Shan Brigade alone adjusted more than 500 mu with each other. This not only allowed many good lands to exert their original fertility, but also many bad lands, due to reasonable adjustments, were properly improved and fertilized, and lost the label of backward land.
    There is a lot of land and little labor here, and the production seasons between teams vary greatly. After communization, under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, labor and animal power were organized for large-scale cooperation to ensure intensive cultivation and to avoid violating agricultural seasons. For example, when deep ploughing the soil, the Daya, Baiyun, and Ruiyun management districts had less early rice area, so they organized more than 2,000 laborers and more than 500 head of cattle to support the Xin Xian, Guang Gong, Zhang Yang and other brigades in deep ploughing early rice fields. When transplanting rice seedlings, the brigades or production teams with more labor and completing tasks early also drew a portion of labor to support the teams with less labor; for example, the Wai Keng Brigade had less labor and more fields, and was too busy with transplanting rice seedlings. The Zhang Shui Brigade drew 25 rice transplanting hands to support them, so that the transplanting of rice seedlings in the entire commune was advanced by a season compared to previous years, changing the phenomenon of transplanting rice seedlings in the past at the beginning of summer. In addition to large-scale labor and animal power cooperation, teams also carried out mutual support for seeds and other materials. In the past, the Wai Keng Brigade planted low-yield "Yidu Zao" and "Huayu Zao" varieties. This year, the Shang Mao, Xian An and other brigades supported them with a large number of Nan Te Hao and Lu Cai Hao improved varieties, achieving a bumper harvest.
    The Xin Xian Commune is a mountainous area with inconvenient transportation. To buy a hoe, you have to travel more than 70 li to Hanjiang to buy it. After the establishment of the commune, more than 300 scattered handicraftsmen were organized to establish an agricultural machinery factory and more than a dozen iron and woodwork repair stations. Last year, when the deep ploughing was in full swing, the commune produced more than 500 deep ploughing plows; during rice transplanting, more than 1,200 rice transplanting boats were rushed to be made, and more than 2,000 pieces of intercropping equipment were newly made and repaired; before the summer harvest, the agricultural machinery factory also made 39 hydraulic, animal-powered, and manpower threshing machines ahead of schedule, and organized more than 60 iron and woodworkers to go to the countryside to repair more than 23,000 pieces of various agricultural tools such as sickles and hoes. This greatly improved work efficiency. In addition, the commune's local fertilizer factory also produced 270,000 dan of granular fertilizer and local miscellaneous fertilizer, and more than 400 dan of local pesticides, which also played a significant role in the bumper harvest of early rice.

    人民公社发挥改造自然战胜灾害的巨大威力
    福建早稻增产　公社立下大功
    一向低产的闽北闽西山区许多公社产量增长二成至一倍以上
    连遭严重灾害的地区公社抗灾大军协力作战大大减少了损失
    本报福州20日电　福建省七百多万亩早稻基本收割完毕，绝大部分地区获得丰收，单位产量超过了大丰收的1958年。各地还出现了成片的亩产八百斤以上到千斤以上的丰产田。一向被称为“低产区”的闽北闽西山区和沿海盐碱地区，许多公社的早稻产量比去年增产两三成到一倍以上，只有遭受自然灾害严重的九龙江、闽江流域部分地区，今年早稻保产或者减了产。
    今年福建省早稻增产，鲜明地显示出人民公社改造自然条件、贯彻八字宪法、征服自然灾害、争夺丰收的巨大优越性。
    公社在改造自然条件方面的威力，表现得特别显著。地处闽浙边境的福鼎县，土质瘦薄，经常发生暴风雨和干旱等灾害。解放前全县仅种植早稻二千亩左右，每亩平均产量仅有一、二百斤。解放后到去年为止，早稻种植面积逐步扩大到三万六千多亩。今年春季，全县又充分运用公社化后人多力大、土地连片、水利统一使用等优越条件，掀起了旱地改水田、单季改双季的扩大早稻种植面积的群众性运动，使早稻面积进一步扩大到四万九千九百多亩。在扩种早稻、力争大面积丰产过程中，广大社员在公社统一安排、统一领导下，都干劲十足地向改造自然进军，战胜了重重困难，获得了特大丰收。全县早稻单位面积产量比去年增产29.4％，总产量比去年增加了62％。这个县地处山区的桐山公社南溪生产大队，集中全队力量把两万多亩土层坚硬的沙质农地改造为土质松软的稻田，使全队早稻由去年的六十四亩扩大到三百一十二亩，单位产量也增加了41％。地处沿海、大部分都是碱质田的沙埕公社后港大队各生产队相互协作，日夜挖塘修渠，从几十里以外引来淡水“洗碱”和灌溉，并大挑“客土”，加厚碱田土层，同时又新修了一条海堤，以预防海潮和台风的袭击，从而使全队早稻总产量比1958年猛增三倍二。处在福建和广东交界的分水关附近的诏安县西潭公社上营大队，有一百一十七亩田分布在分水关山岭上，土质很坏，耕作粗放，产量一向很低，解放前，每亩一季收不上一百斤谷，解放后组织了互助组、合作社，产量有了提高，最高时每亩能收五百斤左右。去年公社化以后，这个大队专门组织了一支改造低产田的生产队，根据八字宪法的要求，按照每一丘田的不同土质和土层，分别进行土壤深翻，增施肥料，平均每亩施下塘泥、海肥、墙土肥等一百担左右，改良了土壤，把贫瘠的山田全部改造成肥沃的良田，及时插下秧苗。随后，又根据山田草多、灾害多等特点，精心加强田间管理，战胜多次大雨的袭击，终于在低产山田里，获得了平均亩产六百一十一斤的大丰收。类似这样的例子，在原来的“低产区”，到处可以找到。
    今年6、7月间，从闽江到汀江、九龙江、晋江等地发生暴雨、山洪等灾害，各地人民公社充分表现了抗灾保收的巨大战斗力。由于公社规模大而领导集中，在灾害开始就火速组织起数十万抗灾抢险大军，投入了抗洪、防汛的战斗，并及时组织男女老少全力进行扶苗、洗苗、追肥，促进庄稼很快转青成长。在早稻成熟期间，龙溪、晋江专区和其他沿海地区又连续遭受山洪和台风、暴雨的袭击，这些地区的人民公社在各方面支援下，又立即组织了上百万人的抗灾抢收大军，展开了快收、快打、快藏的“抗灾、抢收”战役，从多次风、洪、雨等灾害中夺回了丰收果实，大大减少了损失。
    本报福州20日电　福建省莆田县新县人民公社发挥强大威力，今年早稻获得大丰收。全社一万三千多亩早稻平均亩产比去年增长了五成多。夏收以后，到处洋溢着大丰收的欢乐，到处传颂着人民公社的优越性。
    新县公社位在莆田县的山区，全社的田地多数散落在深山密林中，有70％是沙质白垩土的贫瘠梯田，一向产量很低。今年为什么能取得这样大的丰收呢？正如该社社员所说的：应该给人民公社记上头功。
    新县公社各项生产门路很广，除农业外，还有砍柴、锯板、烧炭、劈竹、编畚箕、采药材等多种经济。公社化后，社大、人多、经营的项目也多，乍看起来，公社人多事也多，反正一个样。但经过公社统一筹划，就腾出许多劳力来。过去多种经营因为过于分散，光从采原料、加工到挑上市场销售，不知要多花多少劳力，现在，各个大队都组织了专业队经营，按计划按合同办事，全公社就可以腾出了上千个劳力，投入农业生产。在农业生产方面，积肥、田间管理或其他农事活动，许多也采取专业队经营和发动群众突击相结合的办法，既合理使用了劳力，又保证了耕作质量。去冬把70％的早稻田深翻；翻后又全面烧土熏田，每亩烧了五十堆至七十堆；春节后，社员又大沤大施绿肥。所有这些都是在公社化以后才办到的。
    公社成立以后，田地也能作到合理经营。新县公社各大队的田地多数星散在深山里，互相交错，离村很远。过去由于往返费时，管理不便，很多好地插了单季稻，耕作粗放，产量很低。公社化后，各大队、生产队都本着有利生产的原则，协商解决了插花地的问题。只是新县大队与可山大队就互相调整了五百多亩。这样不但使许多好地发挥出了本来的地力，而且许多坏地也由于合理调整以后，经过适当的改良土壤，增施肥料，丢掉了落后田的帽子。
    这里土地多、劳力少，队与队之间的生产季节相差较远。公社化后，在公社党委的统一领导下，组织了劳力畜力大协作，保证了精耕细作，作到不违农时季节。如深翻土时，大洋、白云、瑞云等管理区早稻的面积较少，就组织了二千多个劳力和五百多只耕牛，支援新县、广宫、张洋等大队深翻早稻田。插秧时，劳力较多、任务完成得早的大队或生产队也抽出一部分劳力，支援劳力少的队；如外坑大队劳力少，田地多，插秧忙不过来，樟水大队就抽出二十五个插秧手支援他们。使全社插秧比往年提早一个节季，改变了过去插立夏秧的现象。除了劳力畜力大协作外，队与队间还开展了种子等物资的互相支援。外坑大队过去都是插低产的“一度早”、“花鱼早”品种，今年上茅、仙安等大队支援它们大批的南特号、陆财号良种，取得了大丰收。
    新县公社是个交通不便的山区，买把锄头，也得跑七十多里路，到涵江去买。公社成立以后，把三百多个零星的手工业者组织起来，成立了一个农械厂和十多个铁木工修配站。去年大闹深翻时，全社即生产了深耕犁五百多部；插秧时，赶制了一千二百多架插秧船，新制和修补了二千多件中耕器；夏收前，农械厂又提早制造了水力、畜力、人力打谷机三十九部，并组织六十多个铁木工下乡修理镰刀、锄头等各种农具二万三千多件。这样就大大提高了工效。此外，公社的土化肥厂还自造了颗粒肥、土杂肥二十七万担，土农药四百多担，对早稻大丰收也起了很大作用。
