Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: The "New York Post" recently published an advertisement by the United Steelworkers of America. The advertisement revealed the shocking profits of twelve large American steel companies.

The advertisement pointed out that the profit for the first half of 1959 was $694,600,000, the highest profit in history.

1958 was a recession year for steelworkers, but the profit was $287 million, ranking fourth in the history of the steel industry.

The advertisement pointed out that based on the average profit for the first half of this year, the profit of the steel industry is:
	"3,837,569 dollars per day (after taxes)
	"26,715,385 dollars per week (after taxes)
	"115,766,667 dollars per month (after taxes)."

The advertisement pointed out that there are now fewer workers, but more steel is being produced. In 1957, it took thirteen man-hours to produce one ton of steel. In May 1959, it took 10.9 man-hours to produce one ton of steel. In the past two years, the steel industry has reduced the number of workers by 37,554.

However, while the steel industry's own reports prove that fewer steelworkers are increasing production and breaking all profit records, it is spreading propaganda about low production efficiency.

The advertisement condemned the behavior of the steel industry bosses in obtaining huge profits while refusing to increase workers' wages as shameful. It said, "Now is the time for the steel industry to stop trying to fool the people." (Attached picture)

### 拒绝增加工资　加强劳动强度　美国钢铁老板赚钱创空前纪录

　　拒绝增加工资　加强劳动强度
　　美国钢铁老板赚钱创空前纪录
    新华社16日讯　“纽约邮报”最近刊登了美国联合钢铁工人工会的一幅广告。广告揭露了美国十二家大钢铁公司的惊人的利润。
    广告指出，1959年上半年的利润是六亿九千四百六十万美元，这是历史上最高的利润。
    1958年对钢铁工人来说是一个衰退的年头，但是利润是二亿八千七百万美元，在钢铁工业历史上占第四位。
    广告指出，按照今年上半年的利润平均计算，钢铁工业的利润是：“每天三百八十三万七千五百六十九美元（扣除捐税）
    “每周二千六百七十一万五千三百八十五美元（扣除捐税）
    “每月一亿一千五百七十六万六千六百六十七美元（扣除捐税）”。
    广告指出，现在工人少，生产的钢却更多了。1957年，生产一吨钢需要十三个工时。1959年5月，生产一吨钢需要十点九个工时。在过去二年中，钢铁工业已经减少了三万七千五百五十四名工人。
    但是，在钢铁工业自己的报告证明较少的钢铁工人正在增加生产和打破所有的利润纪录的时候，它却又散布生产效率不高的宣传。
    广告谴责钢铁工业老板在获得巨大利润的同时而拒绝增加工人工资的行为是可耻的。它说，“现在是钢铁工业停止试图愚弄人民的时候了。”（附图片）
