Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 18th: The Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, planned and manipulated by the United States, closed here today. The meeting's proceedings fully confirmed the United States' sinister attempt to further interfere in Cuba and suppress national democratic movements in Latin America. The meeting also showed that despite the great pressure the United States exerted to force the passage of resolutions favorable to its intervention, its plot was not entirely successful.

The meeting passed a resolution on the issue of "non-intervention," stipulating the expansion of the powers of the Inter-American Peace Committee under the Organization of American States. This allows the United States to interfere in the Caribbean countries through this body, which is controlled by the United States and headed by an American. The resolution stipulates that the committee has the power to "study" the problems facing the Caribbean region, "review" methods and measures to prevent foreign intervention, "investigate" the causes of tension in the region, and submit a report to the Eleventh Inter-American Conference to be held in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, in February next year.

During the discussion, Cuba stated that in principle it did not oppose the initiative to grant special powers to the Inter-American Peace Committee, but it disagreed with the initial plan proposed by the working group studying the issue of so-called non-intervention. Cuba only agreed that the Peace Committee should submit a report to the Quito conference in February next year, and opposed it conducting so-called "investigations."

In his speech on the 13th, U.S. Secretary of State Herter demanded the establishment of a special body called the "Special Temporary Committee" to engage in intervention activities in the Caribbean region. However, this was strongly opposed by Cuba, Venezuela, and Latin American public opinion, and failed to pass.

Cuba's insistence on discussing the issue of economic underdevelopment attracted great interest from Latin American countries that had long been plundered by U.S. capital. The United States opposed discussing this topic from the beginning. Fierce debates on this issue took place at the meetings of the working group on economic underdevelopment, chaired by the United States. The draft resolution submitted by the group at the end of the debate even included sentences unfavorable to U.S. monopoly capital, such as: "Latin America needs foreign investment without preconditions." The United States had originally hoped that the resolution would stipulate that investment required "appropriate preconditions." However, under U.S. pressure, the resolution finally adopted on this issue evaded the substance of the problem and became a hollow piece of paper.

The meeting also passed other documents, including resolutions on human rights and representative democracy, as well as the so-called "Declaration of Santiago, Chile." The "Declaration of Santiago, Chile," passed with U.S. support, also quoted the slander from the Ninth Inter-American Conference resolution regarding opposition to "international communism or any other totalitarianism."

The United States adopted insidious methods to manipulate the proceedings of the meeting behind the scenes. U.S. Secretary of State Herter held secret talks with the foreign ministers of many countries during the meeting. On the day before the closing of the meeting alone, Herter held "private meetings" with fifteen foreign ministers. When the meeting was divided over the draft resolution on the so-called non-intervention issue, Herter personally held secret meetings with representatives of the member states of the working group studying the draft in order to exert pressure.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 19th: "Hoy," the organ of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, published an editorial today on the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers that just closed in Santiago, saying that if this meeting was unable to make a clear resolution against the Cuban revolution as its planners had originally intended, and the United States also failed to achieve its goal of condemning Cuba, nor was it able to force the Cuban government to accept a date or deadline for holding elections in our country; the plan to establish an international police force to intervene in Latin American countries did not receive any support; and the United States was also unable to force the appointment of a special "supervisory committee" of the Organization of American States to investigate the "threat" to peace in the Caribbean region; this is partly due to the position taken by Fidel Castro and the revolutionary government, and on the other hand, it is due to the strong pressure of Latin American public opinion, which forced the governments of some countries to carefully consider their votes and speeches.

The editorial continued: However, the imperialists obtained a resolution to expand the powers of the Peace Committee of the Organization of American States in order to use it as a tool for intervention in the Caribbean region. At the same time, a general declaration was issued, which may be used against de facto revolutionary governments, and generally against democratic and people's governments established in Latin America in the future.

### 美洲外长会议闭幕　美国找借口干涉古巴阴谋受挫

　　美洲外长会议闭幕
　　美国找借口干涉古巴阴谋受挫
    新华社圣地亚哥18日电　由美国策划和操纵的美洲外长会议今天在这里闭幕。会议的进程完全证实了美国要通过这次会议进一步干涉古巴和镇压拉丁美洲民族民主运动的凶恶企图。会议还表明，尽管美国施用了很大的压力，强使会议通过了有利于它进行干涉的决议，但是美国的阴谋并没有完全得逞。
    会议在“不干涉问题”上通过了决议，规定扩大美洲国家组织下属的泛美和平委员会的权力，这使美国可以通过这个由美国控制并由美国人任主席的机构来干涉加勒比海各国。决议规定这个委员会有权“研究”加勒比地区面临的问题，“审查”防止外来干涉的方法和措施，“调查”这个地区紧张局势的原因，并向明年2月在厄瓜多尔首都基多召开的第十一届泛美会议提出报告。
    在讨论过程中，古巴曾表示原则上不反对给泛美和平委员会以特别权力的倡议，但是它不同意由研究所谓不干涉问题的工作小组最初提出的方案。古巴只同意和平委员会向明年2月的基多会议提出报告，反对由它进行所谓“调查”。
    美国国务卿赫脱在13日的发言中曾要求建立一个名叫“特别临时委员会”的专门机构来从事加勒比地区的干涉活动。但是遭到古巴、委内瑞拉以及拉丁美洲舆论的强烈反对，未能通过。
    古巴坚持的关于经济不发达问题的讨论吸引着长期受美国资本掠夺的拉丁美洲国家的极大兴趣。美国从一开始就反对讨论这个题目。在由美国主持的研究经济不发达问题小组的会议上曾对这个问题展开激烈的争辩。这个小组在辩论结束时提出的决议草案中还曾包括这种不利于美国垄断资本的句子：“拉丁美洲需要没有先决条件的外国投资。”而美国原来希望决议规定投资需要“适当的先决条件”。但是在美国压力下，会议最后就这个问题通过的决议回避了问题的实质，而成为一项内容空洞的废纸。
    会议还通过了其他一些文件，包括关于人权和代议制民主的决议，以及所谓“智利圣地亚哥宣言”。在美国扶持下通过的“智利圣地亚哥宣言”，又引用了第九届泛美会议决议中关于反对“国际共产主义或其他任何极权主义”的谰言。
    美国采用了阴险的手法，在幕后操纵着会议的进程。美国国务卿赫脱在会议期间同许多国家的外交部长举行了秘密会谈。仅在会议闭幕的前一天，赫脱就同十五个外交部长进行了“私下会晤”。当会议对所谓不干涉问题的决议草案发生分歧时，赫脱并亲自同研究这一草案的工作小组的成员国代表举行秘密会议，以施加压力。
    据新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴人民社会党机关报“今日报”今天就刚在圣地亚哥闭幕的美洲外长会议发表社论说，如果说这次外长会议没有能像它的策划人原来企图的那样作出反对古巴革命的明确决议，美国也没有达到使会议谴责古巴的目的，也没有能够迫使古巴政府接受我国举行选举的日期或期限；建立用于干涉拉丁美洲各国的国际警察部队的计划没有得到任何支持；美国也没有能够强迫任命一个美洲国家组织专门的“监督委员会”来调查对加勒比地区和平的“威胁”；这一方面是由于菲德尔·卡斯特罗和革命政府所采取的立场，而另一方面是由于拉丁美洲人民舆论的强大压力，这种压力迫使一些国家的政府在投票和发言时不得不慎重考虑。
    社论接着指出：然而，帝国主义者取得了扩大美洲国家组织和平委员会权力的决议，以利用它作为干涉加勒比地区的工具。同时也发表了一项总的宣言，它可能被用来反对事实上的革命政府，并且一般地反对将来在拉丁美洲建立的民主的和人民的政府。
