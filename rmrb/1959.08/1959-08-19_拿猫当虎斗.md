Treating Cats as Tigers to Fight
　　Wu Lü

The workers of the Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine in Kailuan, with the spirit of "treating cats as tigers to fight," deal with unsafe phenomena that hinder the leap forward in production, preventing small accidents as if they were large ones, and taking special precautions against major accidents, so that work-related injuries and equipment accidents are gradually reduced (see People's Daily, August 11). This spirit of "treating cats as tigers to fight" is very good. Not only should we treat unsafe phenomena that hinder the leap forward in production this way, but we should also "treat cats as tigers to fight" when facing all difficulties that hinder the leap forward in production.

At first glance, "treating cats as tigers to fight" seems a bit like "increasing the enemy's prestige and diminishing one's own spirit," which is not worth advocating. But in fact, it is not. Increasing the enemy's prestige and diminishing one's own spirit is a kind of defeatist sentiment; "treating cats as tigers to fight" is a positive fighting spirit, and the two are fundamentally different. Of course, if it is just "treating cats as tigers," there are also two situations. One is "treating cats as tigers to avoid them": clearly a cat, but thinking it is a tiger, so fleeing in terror. This is indeed not worth advocating. The workers of the Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine "treat cats as tigers" by "treating cats as tigers to fight": clearly a cat, but not being careless at all, fighting it as if it were a tiger. Here, they both strategically despise difficulties, with high morale, and tactically value difficulties, without underestimating the enemy at all. With this fighting spirit that unites strategic contempt for difficulties and tactical emphasis on difficulties, we can have sufficient ideological and material preparations to fight against difficulties, and the result can often be foolproof and invincible.

Some people call temporary difficulties in the course of progress "roadblocks." Are these difficulties as difficult to deal with as fierce tigers? No, this is also the meaning of "treating cats as tigers to fight." The People's Daily editorial on August 6 said: "On our road of continued leap forward, it is not that there are no difficulties. However, these difficulties are only some temporary and partial difficulties on our leap forward road." It also said: "Our Party is growing and becoming stronger in the struggle against various difficulties, moving from one victory to another. Now our conditions for overcoming difficulties are not worse than in the past, but much better than in the past." It can be seen that the difficulties we face are not ferocious tigers. However, we do not therefore become careless and indifferent. The consequences of carelessness and indifference are often: slackened fighting spirit, leading to failure.

As for those who "treat cats as tigers to avoid them," they also exist. These are the people with right-leaning sentiments. Clearly, they are only some temporary and partial difficulties, but in their view, they are terrible and insurmountable difficulties; clearly, the conditions for overcoming difficulties are much better than in the past, but in their view, they are much worse than in the past, so that they lack confidence and lose heart. It is very necessary to criticize the right-leaning sentiments of these people. "Treating cats as tigers to fight" means that we should go all out to overcome some temporary and partial difficulties. With this spirit of "fighting," our revolutionary cause can continue to achieve greater successes.

　　拿猫当虎斗
　　吴滤
    开滦唐家庄煤矿的工人以“拿猫当虎斗”的精神，对待障碍生产跃进的不安全现象，小事故大防、大事故特防，使工伤事故和设备事故逐渐减少（见8月11日人民日报）。这“拿猫当虎斗”的精神很好。不只是对待障碍生产跃进的不安全现象；对待一切障碍生产跃进的困难，都应该“拿猫当虎斗”。
    乍一看，“拿猫当虎斗”好像有点“长敌人的威风，灭自己的志气”，很不足为训。其实却不然。长敌人的威风，灭自己的志气，是一种失败情绪；“拿猫当虎斗”是一种积极的战斗精神，两者根本不同。当然，如果只是“拿猫当虎”，也还有两种情况。一种是“拿猫当虎避”：分明是猫，却以为是老虎，于是逃之夭夭。这确实不足为训。唐家庄煤矿的工人“拿猫当虎”是“拿猫当虎斗”：分明是猫，但一点也不麻痹大意，像斗老虎一样地去斗它。这里既在战略上蔑视困难，斗志昂扬；又在战术上重视困难，毫不轻敌。有了这种把在战略上蔑视困难和在战术上重视困难统一起来的战斗精神，就可以有足够的思想准备和物质准备去向困难作斗争，其结果往往能百无一失，立于不败之地。
    有人把前进中的暂时困难称作“拦路虎”。莫非这些困难都同猛虎一样的难于对付吗？不是的，这也是“拿猫当虎斗”的意思。8月6日人民日报的社论说：“在我们继续跃进的道路上，并不是没有困难的。但是，这些困难不过是我们跃进道路上的一些暂时的局部的困难”。又说：“我们党正是在同各种各样的困难作斗争中成长和壮大，从一个胜利走向又一个胜利的。现在我们克服困难的条件，不是比过去更差，而是比过去好得多了”。可见，我们面前的困难并不是什么凶猛异常的老虎。但是，我们并不因此麻痹大意，满不在乎。麻痹大意，满不在乎的后果常常是：斗志松懈，招致失败。
    至于“拿猫当虎避”的人也是有的。这就是那些有右倾情绪的人。分明只是一些暂时的局部的困难，在他们看来却是不得了的对付不了的大困难；分明克服困难的条件比过去好多了，在他们看来却是比过去差多了，以致信心不足，松劲泄气。对这种人的右倾情绪大加批判，是很有必要的。“拿猫当虎斗”，也就是说应当鼓足干劲克服一些暂时的局部的困难，有了这种“斗”的精神，我们的革命事业就能不断地取得更大的成就。
