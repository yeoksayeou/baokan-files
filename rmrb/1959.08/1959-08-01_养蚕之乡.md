Home of Sericulture

Have you been to Taihu Lake? The Taihu People's Commune in Wuxi County, on the shores of Taihu Lake, is an old silkworm area. More than 8,200 mu of mulberry gardens in the commune (accounting for 32.52% of the total cultivated land) are mostly old mulberry gardens; some mulberry gardens have been cultivated for thirty or forty years. In the first spring after the people's commune was established, they created a miracle in silkworm production. The average yield of mulberry leaves per mu was 670 jin; more than 5,100 silkworm egg cards produced an average of 70 jin each, and 45 cards exceeded "100 jin." The commune's spring cocoon income was more than 460,000 yuan, accounting for 61.53% of the total summer harvest income, with an average of 42 yuan per household.

　　Grasping Sericulture Starts with Grasping Mulberries

How exactly do you grasp mulberry fields? The reporter specially went to the Xinan Brigade to inspect a 22-mu old mulberry field with a yield of 1,140 jin per mu. This mulberry field has been cultivated for twenty-seven or eight years. The main trunk is as thick as two bowls, and the branches are raised high like arms; the top is like a lion's head, and like a tightly clenched fist. The old silkworm farmer Yuan Fuxiang calls it the "mulberry fist."

Generally speaking, mulberry trees of about 30 years old should reduce production year by year; but Yuan Fuxiang said: "We can make it 'rejuvenate'." This requires breaking the old rules in management. He said that fertilizer is the food of mulberry trees, and it is necessary to ensure that enough fertilizer is applied. The team stipulates that each load of human manure is only allowed to water six or seven mulberry trees; the method of fertilization is to dig a pit first, then pour manure, and cover the soil after the manure juice penetrates to the roots. Weeding should follow fertilization. To control pests, you can’t use medicine (silkworms will be poisoned if there is medicine on the mulberry); mainly rely on both hands. This spring, there were a lot of mulberry inchworms and mulberry borers. What should we do? Only concentrate our forces to encircle and annihilate them, and seize mulberry leaves from the mouths of the insects.

　　Breaking the Old and Establishing the New

Gao Yumei, a member of the Dongding Production Team of the Helu Brigade, is forty-two years old this year and started raising silkworms at the age of sixteen or seventeen. Based on her many years of experience, she does have a set of methods for raising silkworms using the old methods. Let’s talk about removing sand. She always moves the silkworms from one mat to another faster than others, and her hands and feet are so light that she will not injure any silkworms. But she has conservative ideas: "The highest single yield can only be 50 jin."

Can the single yield be further improved? Gao Yumei never dared to think about it in the past. When the spring seeds were distributed this spring, the team asked her to participate in raising six pioneer cards, requiring a single yield of 120 jin. At first, she thought the leaders were joking with her. Later, she repeatedly bargained. As a result, she agreed to 100 jin verbally, but she was not even sure about 70 or 80 jin in her heart. She has never openly opposed the new technologies advocated by the commune, but she always suspects: what about "hygrometers," what about adding penicillin to feed and garlic to treat diseases, what about heating with Tianlong and Dilong... Won't these things kill the silkworms? However, the facts dispelled her doubts. As a result of raising silkworms according to the new technology, the silkworms grew stronger and stronger. When the cocoons were placed on the frame and weighed, the average single yield was 119 jin and 15 liang! Yumei's old superstitions were broken.

　　A Collective Rearing Room

This is a brick-and-tile house that the members of the Dongding Production Team voluntarily vacated, with fly screens sealing the doors and windows. Four silkworm stands occupy three corners of the room, with silkworm mats placed on top of each other. The feet of the silkworm stands are surrounded by piles of lime. A bamboo-woven paper fan, two feet wide and more than three feet long, is suspended from the roof beam. When the "red column" (thermometer) hanging on the wall rises to a level that makes the silkworms uncomfortable, it is pulled and rattles. On a small table, there are bottles of penicillin, garlic juice and "Xilisheng" anti-stiffness powder, and two compression-type epidemic prevention sprayers are also placed aside. This is a small hospital for treating silkworms.

In the entire silkworm room, what is even more noticeable is the use of "straw curtains" to cover the silkworms. Straw curtains are low in cost, and they are ventilated and breathable; sprinkling some water on the curtains keeps the room moist for a longer time. If you don't cover the silkworms when raising them, the fresh mulberry leaves will dry out in less than two hours, and only 20% of each mulberry leaf is utilized (silkworms don't eat dry leaves), so you have to feed them more than ten times a day. After covering with straw curtains, the mulberry leaves are still fresh for four or five hours, and the utilization rate of each mulberry leaf is increased to 80%, and the number of times of feeding leaves per day is reduced to three or four times. Rong Qinxiu, the leader of this collective rearing room, said: "The work efficiency has been improved, and mulberry leaves have been saved. Now we four people don't feel strenuous even if we raise fourteen silkworm cards."

This production team raised 47 spring silkworm cards, with an average single yield of 90 and a half jin, which is one of the best in the entire brigade. However, they are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. Several women in the collective rearing room said with vigor: "We will make the summer and autumn silkworms surpass the spring silkworms!"

### 养蚕之乡

    养蚕之乡
    你到过太湖吗？在太湖之滨的无锡县太湖人民公社是个老蚕区。全社八千二百多亩桑园（占总耕地面积的32.52％）大部分是老桑园；有的桑园自栽培以来，已有三、四十年的历史。在人民公社化以后的第一个春天，他们在蚕桑生产上创造了奇迹。桑叶平均亩产六百七十斤；五千一百多张蚕种，平均单产七十斤，超过“百斤”的有四十五张种。全社春茧收入四十六万多元，占夏熟总收入的61.53％，平均每户可得到四十二元。
      抓蚕先抓桑
    桑田到底怎么抓法？记者特地到溪南大队察看了一块亩产一千一百四十斤的二十二亩大的老桑田。这块桑田已经栽培了二十七八年，主干有两碗粗，支干像臂膀那样高高举起；顶端像狮子头，又像握得紧紧的拳头，老蚕农袁福祥叫它“桑拳”。
    一般说，三十年左右的桑树，应该是一年一年地减产了；但是袁福祥却说：“我们能叫它‘返老还童’。”这就要打破管理上的陈规。他说，肥料是桑树的粮食，要保证肥料下得足，队里规定每担人粪只准浇六、七棵桑树；施肥的方法，是先挖塘，后浇粪，等粪汁渗透到树根再盖土。下肥以后跟着就要除草。治虫，不能用药治
  （桑上有药，蚕儿就中毒），主要靠两只手。今春的桑尺蠖、桑蛀虫多得很，怎么办？只有集中兵力围歼，从虫嘴里夺下桑叶。
            破旧立新
    河埒大队东丁生产队的社员高玉美，今年四十二岁，十六七岁就开始养蚕了。她凭多年的经验，用老法子养蚕确实有一套办法。就谈除沙吧，将一张?子里的蚕换到另一张?子里去，她的动作总比别人快，手脚轻得不会碰伤任何一条蚕。但她有保守思想：“单产最高也只能五十斤”。
    单产能不能再提高？高玉美过去想也不敢想。今春春种发下来，队里要她参加饲养六张先行种，要求单产达到一百二十斤。起初她以为领导上和她开玩笑，后来她一再地还价钱，结果嘴上答应的是一百斤，心里连七十斤、八十斤也没把握。公社提倡的一套新技术，她没有公开地反对过，但总是怀疑：什么“干湿计”啦，什么青霉素添食、蒜头治病啦，什么天龙、地龙加温，……这些东西不会送蚕的命吗？但是，事实解开了她的疑团，照新技术饲养的结果，蚕儿越长越壮。茧子下簇，上秤一称，平均单产一百一十九斤十五两！玉美的老迷信破除了。
        一个共育室
    这是东丁生产队的社员自动让出来的一间砖墙盖瓦的房子，防蝇网封闭了门窗。四个蚕台占用了三个屋角，层层放上了蚕?。蚕台的脚，都围堆上石灰。屋梁上悬挂着一面宽二尺许、长三尺多的竹编纸糊的拉风扇，当墙上挂着的那个“红柱子”（温度计）上升到使蚕儿不舒服的时候，它就被拉得呼拉呼拉地响。在一张小桌上，放着瓶装的青霉素、大蒜汁和“西力生”配的防僵粉，两架压缩式的防疫喷雾筒也放在一边，这就是为蚕儿治病的小医院。
    在整个蚕室内，更引人注意的，是用“草帘”伏盖育蚕。草帘成本低，而且通风透气；帘上洒些水，?内保湿的时间比较长。养蚕不加盖，新鲜的桑叶不到两小时就会干枯，每片桑叶只被利用了20％（干叶蚕儿不吃），一天要喂十多次桑。用草帘加盖以后，四、五个钟点桑叶仍是新鲜的，每片桑叶的利用率提高到80％，每天喂叶的次数减少到三、四次。这个共育室的组长荣琴秀说：“工效提高了，桑叶节省了，现在我们四个人育十四张蚕还不感到吃力。”
    这个生产队春蚕养了四十七张，平均单产九十斤半，在全大队是手屈一指的，但是他们不满足已取得的成绩，共育室的几个妇女精神抖擞地说：“我们要使夏秋蚕超春蚕”  新华日报记者    何寿江（附图片）
