    Anhui iron painting, originally called iron flower, is a special craft artwork made by iron painting artists using iron as raw material and iron hammers as drawing tools, after hammering and refining. This kind of painting has a special style of simple and powerful lines, and staggered composition. According to legend, the earliest founder of this art was Tang Tianchi (Tang Peng), an ironworker from Wuhu in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties.

    Before liberation, the art of iron painting was lost. After liberation, thanks to the care of the Party, the art of iron painting was reborn. Wuhu City found an artisan, Chu Yanqing, who had not made iron paintings for many years, and helped him to resume the creation of iron paintings, and successively hired seven apprentices to learn iron painting.

    In recent years, the production of iron paintings has flourished. Since 1956, more than 500 pieces have been made. The themes of iron paintings are also becoming more and more diverse, including flowers, landscapes, figures, insects, birds and animals, depicting ancient life and modern life. There are also many varieties of iron paintings, in addition to fan-shaped hanging screens, central hall decorations and other forms, there is also a kind of iron painting lamp. The four sides of the lamp are composed of iron paintings, and the light and shadows are lifelike.

    The artistic level of iron paintings has improved significantly in recent years. In May of this year, when the Wuhu City Handicraft Department invited painters and art cadres from relevant fields to solicit opinions on iron paintings, many people were satisfied with the improvement of the artistic level of iron paintings.

    Iron paintings are not only famous in China, but have also received good reviews after being sold abroad recently. (Attached picture)

    铁的艺术
    安徽铁画，原名铁花，是铁画艺人以铁为原料，用铁锤作画笔，经过锤炼，精炼而成的特种工艺美术品。这种画具有线条简明有力、画面参差出入的特殊风格。相传，这种艺术的最早创始人是明末清初的芜湖铁工汤天池（汤鹏）。
    解放前，铁画艺术已失传。解放后，由于党的关怀，铁画艺术才得到新生。芜湖市找到了一位已有多年没有打过铁画的艺人储炎庆，帮助他恢复铁画的创作活动，并且先后抽聘了七个徒弟学打铁画。
    几年来，铁画生产蓬勃发展。1956年以来，已打了五百多幅。铁画的题材也越来越多了，有花卉、有山水、有人物、有昆虫、有飞禽走兽，有表现古代生活的，也有表现现代生活的。铁画的品种也很多，除了扇形吊屏、中堂等形式外，还有一种铁画灯，灯的四面用铁画组成，灯光画影，栩栩如生。
    铁画的艺术水平几年来有了显著提高。今年5月，芜湖市手工业部门聘请了有关方面的画家和艺术干部征求对铁画的意见时，许多人对铁画艺术水平的提高感到满意。
    铁画不仅在国内负有盛名，最近行销国外以后也获得好评。（附图片）
