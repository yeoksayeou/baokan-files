　　Golden Star Commune Overcomes Rare Drought Threat in Recent Years
　　Corn and Sorghum Grow Lush and Strong
    Taiyuan, August 18th (reported by this newspaper) - The Xigou Golden Star Commune in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, led by national agricultural labor model Li Shunda, overcame the drought demon through forty days of hard work by cadres and the masses. Not only were the commune's more than 19,000 mu of autumn crops undamaged, but they also grew unprecedentedly well. Corn generally grew two ears, millet stalks reached about five chi in height, and sorghum and beans grew lush and strong.
    The Golden Star Commune has thin soil and poor water conservancy conditions. In early July, just when crops needed water, it suffered a drought rarely seen in recent years. The commune's Party committee immediately organized commune members and cadres to inspect the drought situation, and at the same time, widely mobilized drought resistance, quickly forming a drought resistance and seedling protection movement. In the fight against drought, the commune members put forward slogans such as "Complete two days' task in one day; if you can't finish it, fight at night," and "Fight the sun during the day, fight the moon at night." As a result, they continuously broke labor quotas. In the past, commune members would run home when it rained, but now they run from home to the fields when it rains. Recently, Li Shunda led commune members to climb mountains in the rain to divert floodwaters to irrigate the fields, irrigating more than 600 mu of highlands and remote lands in one day. National labor model and deputy director of the commune, Shen Jilan, led the female commune members of the Xigou Management Area in the fight against drought, organizing a drought resistance commando team that left early and returned late without rest at noon, bringing water and dry food to the fields, completing each task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.
    The Golden Star Commune clearly put forward the grand slogan of "Hard work overcomes the heavens, drought resistance ensures increased production" in the fight against drought. On the one hand, they considered the worst and made plans for disaster prevention and drought resistance, and on the other hand, they started with the best and actively strengthened field management of autumn crops and miscellaneous grains.
    Recently, commune members throughout the commune carried water to irrigate 2,500 mu of drought-affected third-class autumn fields. More than 3,000 mu of third-class seedlings in the commune have been hoed four times, one to two times more than originally planned; an average of 100 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu of third-class seedlings, one more application than in ordinary fields; weeds along the edges of the fields were generally removed. In addition, cadres divided leadership responsibility areas, commune members fixed operating responsibility lands, and strengthened management work such as corn heart irrigation, weeding, and pest control.
    In the drought resistance movement, the commune Party secretary contracted with backward management areas, and the management area secretary contracted with backward production teams, strengthening the leadership of backward units. In addition, they promoted the spirit of collaboration and organized advanced teams to support backward teams. As a result, 54% of the commune's autumn fields reached first-class standards, and 46% reached second-class standards. All of the original 3,000 mu of third-class seedlings were upgraded. More than 20 production teams in the commune with relatively backward work have caught up with the advanced production teams in the fight against drought.
    Recently, it rained here, and the drought situation has begun to ease. The commune has once again proposed to continue the fight with the same fighting posture against the drought, seize the favorable season after the rain, and step up the late-stage processing of autumn fields. The commune has now launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on cutting Artemisia grass to compost green manure. (Photo attached)

　　金星公社战胜近年少见的干旱威胁
　　玉米高粱生长茂密茁壮
    本报太原18日电　全国农业劳动模范李顺达领导的山西平顺县西沟金星公社，干部和群众苦干四十天，战胜了旱魔。全社一万九千多亩秋禾，不仅没有受到损害，而且生长得空前好，玉米普遍结了两个穗，谷子株高五尺左右，高粱和豆类都长得茂密壮实。
    金星公社石厚土薄，水利条件较差。7月初，正当作物需水季节，却遭到了近几年来少有的干旱。公社党委会立即组织社员、干部检查旱情，同时广泛动员抗旱，一个抗旱保苗运动迅速形成了。在抗旱斗争中，社员们提出了“两天任务一天完，完不成就打夜战”，“白天战太阳，夜晚战月亮，”的口号。因此连续突破劳动定额。过去下雨社员往家里跑，现在下雨时却是从家往地里跑。最近，李顺达领导社员们冒雨上山引洪灌田，一天内灌了六百多亩高地和远地。全国劳动模范、公社副主任申纪兰，在抗旱中领导西沟管理区的女社员，组织了一个抗旱突击队，早出晚归不歇晌，下地带水带干粮，每项任务都提前超额完成。
    金星公社在抗旱中明确提出了
  “干劲胜过天，抗旱保超产”的宏伟口号。他们一方面从坏处着想，作防灾抗灾的打算，一方面从好处着手，积极加强秋禾和杂粮的田间管理。
    最近，全社社员担水灌溉了受旱的三类秋田二千五百亩。全社三千多亩三类苗已锄过了四遍，比原计划多锄了一至两遍；平均每亩三类苗追肥一百担，比一般地多追一次肥；普遍拔除了地边蒿草。另外，干部划分了领导责任区，社员固定了操作责任地，加强了玉米灌心、除草、治虫等管理工作。
    在抗旱运动中，公社党委书记包干落后管理区，管理区书记包干落后生产队，加强了落后单位的领导。此外，还发扬协作精神，组织先进队支援落后队。因此，全社一类秋田已达到了54％，二类秋田占到了46％，原有的三千多亩三类苗全部升级。全社二十多个工作比较落后的生产队，在抗旱斗争中都赶上了工作先进队。
    最近，这里下了雨，旱像已开始解除。公社又提出以抗旱的战斗姿态再接再厉，抓住雨后有利季节，抓紧秋田后期加工。现在全社已开展了以割蒿草沤绿肥为中心的积肥运动。（附图片）
