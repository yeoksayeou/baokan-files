    Advocating Speaking After Learning

    Siwang Management Area, Hanping Commune, Jishan County, Shanxi Province

    Professor Lü Xiaowu of Shanxi Agricultural College, along with two teaching assistants, went to Wayao Village in Jincheng County to become students of the veteran sheep herder Ning Huatang. After studying for half a year, they overturned some outdated arguments in the old science of sheep raising. As a result, three books related to sheep raising, "Ning Huatang's Sheep Herding Experience," "How to Get Ewes to Produce More Lambs," and "A Hundred Sheep Herding Ballads," were published.

    Although not every village in the country has a Ning Huatang, and not every cadre sent to the countryside is necessarily a Lü Xiaowu, it is certain that every village has experienced farmers, and every cadre sent to the countryside can read and write. So, can't we draw good inspiration from this?

    Veteran farmers, veteran farmers, are all people experienced in agricultural affairs. These people have at least thirty to forty years of farming experience. Although scattered, it is rich, and many veteran farmers have a complete set of experience in a certain aspect of agricultural work. For example, in our village, there is an old man named Zhang Xintai. No matter when, he can tell if it will rain within a few days just by looking up at the sky. His nickname is "Mr. Rain." He has a set of skills for observing the weather, but unfortunately, his skills have not yet been recorded and compiled. If cadres sent to the countryside, in addition to their agricultural work, help veteran farmers record and summarize their agricultural experiences, over time, many small contributions will make a big one. People engaged in scientific research can then use these experiences as a basis to write true "Chinese Agricultural Meteorology," "Chinese Soil Science," "Chinese Botany," "Chinese Crop Cultivation"... This will be of great merit to the combination of science and production and the development of science in our country.

    Why don't the comrades sent to the countryside be happy to do this?

    提倡学而后述
    山西稷山县汉萍公社四望管理区　牛六娃
    山西农学院吕效吾教授带了两名助教到晋城县瓦窑上给老羊工宁华堂当学生。学了半年，推翻了旧养羊学的一些陈腐论点，于是三本有关养羊的书“宁华堂牧羊经验”、“怎样使母羊多下羔”、“牧羊歌诀百首”问世了。
    全国虽然不是村村有个宁华堂，下放干部也不一定个个都是吕效吾。但可以肯定村村有老农，下放干部个个识字会写。那么，从这件事里，不是可以得到很好的启发吗？
    老农老农，都是些老于农事的人，这些人种地至少也有三四十年的经验。虽然零星，但却丰富，而且不少老农在农事的某一方面是有一整套经验的。比如我们村里有个张新太老汉，不论什么时候，抬头一看就知道几天以内有雨，外号就叫“雨先生”。他对观测气象，有一套本领，可惜到现在还没有把他那套本领记下来，整理出来。如果下放干部在农事之余，帮助老农把他们的农业经验记录下来，总结一下，久而久之，集腋成裘。从事科学研究的人便可以以这些经验为基础，写出真正的“中国农业气象学”、“中国土壤学”、“中国植物学”、“中国作物栽培学”……。这对我国科学与生产相结合和科学的发展都将大有功德的。
    下放的同志们何不乐而为之呢？
