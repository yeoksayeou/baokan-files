Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 9th: According to the Romanian News Agency, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Romanian Council of Ministers have decided to reduce retail prices of industrial products and food, effective August 10th.

　　The prices of many woolen and cotton fabrics will be reduced by 6% to 25%; cotton textiles and knitwear prices will be reduced by 5% to 47%; and shoes will be reduced by 8% to 28%.

　　The prices of certain foods, such as sugar and confectionery, will be reduced by 7% to 35%.

　　As a result of this price reduction, the Romanian people will benefit by more than one billion lei annually.

　　It was previously reported that the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, at its enlarged meeting held in July this year, adopted a decision to increase workers' wages by an average of 10% from August 1st this year; the wages of engineers, technicians, administrative personnel in the production sector, and staff in state organs will be increased by an average of 8%; salaries of service personnel in the socialist commercial sector, teachers in ordinary middle schools and technical vocational schools, as well as officers and generals of the armed forces will also be increased. The resolution also stipulated reducing wage income tax and increasing pensions, relief funds, and various subsidies.

　　The increase in wages and subsidies and the reduction in wage income tax are equivalent to about one-seventh of the total wage fund and subsidies.

　　In recent years, the Romanian Party and government have taken a series of measures to improve the material welfare of the working people on the basis of production development. In 1959, the real wages of workers and staff in Romania increased by more than 30% compared with 1955. Thus, the task stipulated by the Party's Second Congress (1955) regarding increasing the real wages of employees was fulfilled one year ahead of schedule.

    新华社布加勒斯特9日电　据罗马尼亚通讯社报道：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会和罗马尼亚部长会议决定自8月10日起减低工业品和食品零售价格。
    许多毛织品和棉布的价格将减低6％到25％；棉织品和针织品的价格将减低5％到47％；鞋子将减低8％到28％。
    某些食品，例如，糖、点心的价格将减低7％到35％。
    由于这次减低价格，罗马尼亚人民每年将获益十亿列伊以上。
    前已报道，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会在今年7月举行的扩大会议上，曾经通过一项决定，规定从今年8月1日起把工人的工资平均增加10％；工程师、技术人员、生产部门的行政人员和国家机关工作人员的工资平均增加8％；社会主义商业部门的服务人员、普通中学和技术业余学校的教师以及武装部队的军官和将军的薪资也有所增加。决议还规定减少工资所得税，增加养老金、抚恤金和各种补助金。
    工资、补助金的增加部分和工资所得税减少部分，约等于全部工资基金和补助金总额的七分之一。
    最近几年来，罗马尼亚党和政府在生产发展的基础上，采取了一系列措施来提高劳动人民的物质福利。1959年罗马尼亚的工人和职员的实际工资比1955年增加30％以上。这样，党的第二次代表大会（1955年）规定的关于增加职工实际工资的任务，就提前一年实现了。
