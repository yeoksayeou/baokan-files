      "Now we're spreading our wings again!"
    The members of the Fenghuo Production Team of the Fenghuo People's Commune are so excited and happy. They feel like they are soaring high again.
    There was a brief period when their bumper harvest campaign was "tight for a while, then loose for a while," and field management work was "good for a while, then poor for a while." Why? The reason was that the emotions of some cadres and a small number of commune members were "hot for a while, then cold for a while." How "awkward" this was! Wang Baojing, the commune leader, and the advanced cadres and the majority of commune members were dissatisfied with this situation. They spread their wings to face the sun, used their enthusiasm to repel the cold wind, and soared high again with great pleasure.
    The wings of the bumper harvest campaign are the measures to increase production. The fuller the feathers, the farther the roc can fly. The more measures to increase production, the higher the targets the bumper harvest campaign can achieve. However, to fly high, one must spread one's wings. Without drive, it's difficult to spread one's wings, even if one has them. Conversely, without wings, one can't fly, even with drive. Wings must be spread constantly. If wings are not spread, they will degenerate. It is said that the wings of chickens gradually degenerated into those of domestic fowl because they flew less and less. The less the wings fly, the more they degenerate, and the more the wings degenerate, the more they lose their ability to fly. The more effort one puts into flying, the more developed the wings become; the more developed the wings, the greater the flying power. The greater the drive, the more measures can be taken; the more measures taken, the more sufficient the drive becomes. Just as the People's Daily editorial on August 7th said: "The more measures to resist disasters and increase production, the more specific they are, the more fully the masses' enthusiasm is boosted, the more substantial the content of the production movement becomes, the smaller the market for right-leaning slackening emotions becomes, and the more guaranteed the autumn harvest will be."
    It is precisely after "spreading their wings" that the comrades of the Fenghuo Team have made their "wings" fuller and their flying power greater. In order to promote the bumper harvest campaign, they first eliminated slackening thoughts, so that everyone in the team was full of drive; in order to make the drive more sufficient and more solid, they constantly added new measures. In the first stage, in a ten-day battle, the team basically eliminated the third-class seedlings in the cornfields. Then, they raised the evaluation standards, re-divided the first, second, and third-class seedlings, added measures, and fought again. The measures were raised higher, and the drive also rose higher. ... In this way, despite the bad weather, the Fenghuo Team still flew very high in the Guanzhong area—their corn grew very well.
    The drought resistance campaign is the same: drive produces measures, and measures increase drive. The Fenyang Yu Zhihe Irrigation Area improved the irrigation method and created the highest provincial record for the area of land irrigated per unit of flow, and the Fuyang Special Zone in Anhui Province reformed the water lifting tools to double the speed of irrigation, etc., all of which are the result of sufficient drive; conversely, these advanced measures have raised people's drive to a new height.
    In autumn field management and disaster resistance struggle, let each production unit spread its wings, strive to be the best, and fly high towards the goal of a great autumn harvest! I wish you a bright future!

      “现在又展开翅膀啦！”
    烽火人民公社烽火生产队的社员们是这样兴高采烈，心情畅快。他们觉得自己又在展翅高飞了。
    曾经有那么一个短时期，他们的丰产运动“紧一阵松一阵”，田间管理工作“好一阵差一阵”。为什么呢？原因是一些干部和一小部分社员的情绪“热一阵冷一阵”。这多么“别扭”啊！公社社长王保京和先进的干部、大多数社员群众对这情况是不满意的。他们迎着阳光展开翅膀，用热气击退了冷风，又痛痛快快地高高飞翔起来。
    丰产运动的翅膀就是增产措施。羽毛越丰满，大鹏飞得越远。增产措施越多，丰产运动能达到的指标越高。可是，要高飞，必须展翅。如果没有干劲，有翅也难展。反过来也是一样，如果没有翅膀，有劲也难飞。翅必须常展。有翅不展，就会退化。据说，鸡的翅膀就是在逐渐变为家禽的过程中越来越少飞翔而退化的。翅越不飞越退化，翅退化了就更丧失了飞的能力。越用劲飞，翅膀越发达；翅膀发达了，飞劲也就更大。干劲越大，措施才能越多；措施越多，干劲也就越足。正像人民日报8月7日社论上说的：“抗灾增产的措施越多，越具体，群众的干劲就鼓得越足，生产运动的内容就越发充实，右倾松劲情绪的市场就越小，秋季丰收也就越有保证。”
    烽火队的同志们正是在“展开翅膀”之后，使“翅膀”更加丰满了，飞劲也更大了。他们为了推进丰产运动，先扫除了松劲思想，使全队的人都鼓起了干劲；为了使干劲更充足更踏实，又不断地增添新的措施。第一阶段，十天战斗，全队玉米地里的三类苗基本消灭了。接着，提高了评比标准，重新划分了一、二、三类苗，添加了措施，再战斗。措施提得更高了，干劲也就升得更高。……就这样，尽管天气不好，烽火队在关中地区还是飞得很高——他们的玉米长得很好。
    抗旱运动也是一样：干劲出措施，措施增干劲。汾阳峪直河灌区改进灌水方法创造一个流量浇地面积的全省最高纪录，安徽阜阳专区改革提水工具使浇地进度快了一倍以上，等等，都是干劲足的结果；反过来，这些先进措施又把人们的干劲提到了新的高度。
    在秋田管理和抗灾斗争中，每个生产单位都展开双翅，力争上游，向秋季大丰收的目标高高飞翔吧！祝鹏程万里！
