    The Development of Productive Forces and Relations of Production

    I. Productive Forces and Relations of Production under the Socialist System

    Under the socialist system, public ownership of the means of production, which corresponds to the social nature of production, opens up infinitely broad space for the development of productive forces. Because under these conditions, the planned development of society replaces the anarchy and crises of production, and the comradeship of people working for themselves and for the entire society replaces class conflict.

    Public ownership of the means of production is the foundation of socialist production relations. The development of socialist productive forces consolidates public ownership of the means of production and improves the forms of socialist ownership. Therefore, on the one hand, it is the development of productive forces, and on the other hand, it is the consolidation and improvement of production relations that correspond to these productive forces.

    Does this mean that there are no contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production in a socialist system? No. At a certain stage of development, certain aspects of production will inevitably produce a state of incongruity, and contradictions will arise between them. There is no life, no development without contradictions. The same is true of socialist production. Under the socialist system, productive forces are also the most active and revolutionary factor in production. Productive forces change very rapidly, and certain aspects of production relations often do not keep up with the requirements of the growing productive forces.

    On this basis, contradictions inevitably arise and are constantly resolved. For example, the development of socialist productive forces cannot coexist for long with the forms of division of labor inherited from capitalist society. As everyone knows, under the capitalist system, the contradictions between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor, reach an extremely sharp degree. The socialist revolution and the victory of the socialist system have eliminated the antagonistic nature of this opposition. However, the essential differences between them still exist. The development of socialist productive forces requires the elimination of these essential differences.

    The growth of productive forces in socialist industry and agriculture has led to a situation in which the method of technically serving collective farms through state enterprises (machine tractor stations), which used to play a positive role, is now outdated. In order to benefit the development of socialist production in rural areas, all the factors of production must be concentrated in the hands of collective farmers, that is, concentrated in the collective farms themselves. The Party and the government took this into account and adopted resolutions on reorganizing machine tractor stations and further consolidating collective farms and collective farm ownership, especially public funds.

    In socialist society, the distribution of consumer goods is mainly realized through commodity-money relations. Commodity-money relations under the socialist system have a new essence in terms of quality that is different from commodity-money relations under the capitalist system, and it plays a significant role in the development of socialist society. Commodity-money relations are an integral and necessary aspect of socialist production relations. At present, we cannot do without money and without commodities. But there is no doubt that with the further development of productive forces, consumer goods will be fully guaranteed, and the cooperative collective farm ownership form will be integrated with the public ownership by the whole people. At that time, commodity-money relations will no longer play a positive role in the development of productive forces, and they will conflict with the new and higher level of productive forces. In order to ensure the smoother development of communist society, it is necessary to replace commodity-money relations with the direct distribution of products according to people's needs. Therefore, in this respect, at a certain stage of social development, that is, when socialism develops to a higher stage – communism, commodity-money relations will also become a factor hindering the development of human social productive forces. This contradiction will be resolved by eliminating commodity-money relations, that is, by replacing commodity-money relations with communist product exchange.

    In a socialist system, the relationship between production and consumption is of vital importance to the development of production. Since the relationship between production and consumption in a socialist system has lost its antagonistic nature (because production is directly to meet the social and individual needs of socialist workers), this interaction itself has become a powerful factor in promoting the development of productive forces.

    The development of productive forces has generated new needs among the people of socialist society and provides all new material resources to meet these needs. At the same time, the social needs of people freed from exploitation develop very rapidly, often making production unable to meet these needs in time. However, this contradiction is not antagonistic. It is constantly resolved with the accelerated development of socialist productive forces.

    The necessary changes in production relations are realized with the maturation of the material prerequisites necessary for such changes. Leaping over the specific stages of productive forces development, or deviating from the level of productive forces, will only hinder society's movement towards communism. For example, at the present stage, the conditions for the transition from commodity-money relations to direct product exchange have not yet matured. In order to accelerate communist construction and ensure the realization of this transition, it is necessary not only to develop the material and technical basis of society and obtain abundant material resources, but also to improve commercial work, consolidate the Soviet ruble, and apply the principle of economic accounting in all industrial and agricultural enterprises, etc.

    II. Productive Forces and Relations of Production under the Conditions of Transition from Socialism to Communism

    At present, Soviet society has entered a period of comprehensive development of communist construction. The most important tasks of this period are: to establish the material and technical basis of communism; to further improve the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people; to prepare conditions for eliminating the essential differences between urban and rural areas, between the two forms of public ownership, and between mental and physical labor; to comprehensively develop Soviet people, and to cultivate their ability to manage communist society without the state.

    Of course, the nature of the interaction between the relations of production and the productive forces in this period is still the same as the nature of the past stages of socialist society's development: the relations of production adapt to the nature of the productive forces. But it also has new factors that are related to the emergence and development of communist factors today.

    Where are these changes in production manifested?
    In the next few years, huge changes will take place in the means of production, especially in the tools of labor, and new industrial sectors will be established.

    Let us first talk about productive forces. Social productive forces are composed of two main factors: the tools of labor (i.e., the material and technical materials and tools in industrial enterprises, transportation, state farms, and collective farms, raw materials, and various auxiliary materials necessary for production), including the material and technical materials of production, and the people who use the tools of labor to produce material materials. In the next few years, huge changes will take place in the means of production, especially in the tools of labor, and decisive steps will be completed in establishing the material and technical basis of communism. In the next seven years, tens of thousands of new industrial enterprises will be established, and thousands of factories, mines, and mines will be expanded and re-equipped with modern technology. However, the main changes in the tools of labor will not only be in quantity but also in quality. The development of socialist industry and transportation will be realized under the banner of striving for technological progress. All machine tools in machine manufacturing enterprises will be updated; railways and waterways will be rebuilt; new and more efficient internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives will appear on the national railways. The most important indicator of technological progress in the Seven-Year Plan is the automation and remote control of production, as well as the mechanization of heavy labor processes. In developing industry, the policy adopted by the Soviet Union includes not only the basic production process, but also the mechanization of auxiliary production processes, and exploring all potential to achieve complete mechanization in industry, transportation, and construction. At present, the conditions are ripe for transitioning from partial automation of certain work sections to complete automation of the production process, and appropriately transitioning to the establishment of fully automated workshops and enterprises. In power stations, machine manufacturing industry, chemical industry, petroleum industry, and food industry, the realization of production process automation has particularly favorable conditions. In order to realize the task of complete mechanization and automation of the production process proposed by the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the machine manufacturing industry must produce equipment in the next seven years that can ensure the national economy obtain mechanized and automated high-efficiency tools.

    In agricultural production, the potential for realizing the mechanization of the production process is particularly great, because manual labor still accounts for a considerable proportion. In the next seven years, agricultural productive forces must have a huge leap forward. This requires the socialist industry to provide the necessary equipment for the mechanization of animal husbandry and agricultural labor that used to occupy a large amount of manpower (such as loading and unloading work and other work). Farming tools must also be greatly improved.

    Communist construction should be based on a large-scale expansion of society's power base. During the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will realize the grand program of establishing power stations. However, this has not provided us with all the necessary conditions for establishing the material and technical basis of communism. It will take several more years to complete this task.

    Finally, in the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, the prerequisite for the development and improvement of the tools of labor is the establishment of new industrial sectors. Without new industrial sectors, the material and technical basis of communism is difficult to imagine. The further we go, the more the chemical industry and all its sectors will play a huge role in production. Chemistry can create new materials, which are better in quality than the metals, minerals, and fibers that originally existed in nature and are necessary for modern production. The chemical industry plays an increasingly important role in increasing the yield per unit area, increasing the amount of animal husbandry products, and developing the national power base. The Sixth Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee summarized the tasks of the first year of the successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan and formulated specific measures for completing and overfulfilling the Seven-Year Plan. The Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee paid special attention to strengthening the struggle for technological progress in the national economy as a decisive condition for the successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan, especially complete mechanization and production automation, improving the role of science in the development of production, further specialization and collaboration in the national economy, and finally, also noted the reconstruction, expansion, and re-equipment of existing enterprises.

    The historical plenary session's resolution explained the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan in detail and specifically, revealed the countless potential hidden in the socialist national economy, and pointed out the path to the most rapid realization of the Seven-Year Plan. Technological progress, complete mechanization, and production automation will fully promote the further improvement of labor productivity, which is the decisive condition for the ultimate victory of communism.

    The development of productive forces is not limited to changes in the tools of labor. One of the indicators of high productivity is the accumulation of raw materials, auxiliary materials, and other means of production, without which people and tools of labor cannot function in the production process. In the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, the production of ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals has grown sharply. In order to enable the machine manufacturing industry, which manufactures new tools of labor and daily necessities, to continuously carry out production, it is necessary to have a large amount of metal reserves. In order to develop the chemical industry, a large amount of raw materials is needed: petroleum, refining residues, and gas. Petroleum and gas are the fuel for factories and power stations, and also valuable raw materials for the chemical industry. In the next seven years, the production of all these raw materials and auxiliary materials will grow sharply.

    In the process of communist construction, the proportion of people who directly create material materials is gradually increasing, and people with all-round development in communist society are being formed.

    Another component of productive forces is people. In the process of communist construction, the proportion of people who directly create material materials is gradually increasing. The victory of socialism and the elimination of the exploiting classes have turned the members of society into active socialist laborers. However, in the initial stage, socialist society had to use great efforts to cultivate its own intellectuals, some of whom did not directly participate in the production of material materials. The working class seized power, but without its own intellectuals, without its own intellectuals, it could not manage production and manage society, and it could not improve the cultural level of the people. Therefore, it had to cultivate its own intellectuals from workers and peasants throughout the transition period from capitalism to socialism. Secondary and higher schools basically subordinated their work to this task. A part of the graduates of secondary schools directly participated in production as soon as they left school; a considerable part of the young people even went to production posts without finishing seven years of education.

    Now we are faced with the task of comprehensively developing the construction of communism, and the direction of the entire national education system is to cultivate the all-round development of laborers in communist society, well-educated and skilled staff, so that they can immediately participate in production after graduating from eight-year schools, especially full secondary schools. As a result, not only will the training of cadres nationwide be greatly improved, but also the proportion of laborers who directly create material materials will be increased.

    As a social group, the number of intellectuals is not decreasing, but increasing. However, the proportion of intellectuals who are not related to the process of creating material and spiritual materials is decreasing. On the one hand, the management organs are greatly reduced, and they will be even fewer in the future. On the other hand, with the development of the material and technical basis of society, the proportion of production technology intellectuals who directly participate in the creation of material materials is increasing. Representatives of departments specializing in mental labor, such as science, are increasingly actively participating in the material production process. Because under the conditions of modern technology, not only foremen, engineers, and section chiefs participate in the production process, but also various factory laboratories, and even scientific staff of research institutes, have become a necessary part of the production process. They constantly analyze various links of the technological process, formulate new plans for this process, and apply it to production, design new instruments, and check their functioning. The same is true in agricultural production, agronomists, breeders, veterinarians, mechanics, etc. are the most direct participants in the material material creation process.

    What we have talked about above is all about the quantitative aspect of the problem, which refers to the process of increasing the number of people in various departments directly engaged in creating material wealth. The qualitative aspect is equally important. In the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, the process of all-round development of people is proceeding rapidly. Workers in production not only create material wealth, but also constantly improve their general education level, cultural level, complete secondary education, and many people also complete higher education. The cultural requirements of socialist society's laborers are increasing day by day, and the new socialist attitude towards daily life is becoming more and more popular. In our time, the all-round development of people in the future communist society is being formed. This situation is of great significance for further improving labor productivity. People who treat their labor and the all-round development of technology from the national point of view have opened up new sources and new possibilities for the most rapid improvement of labor productivity.

    The recently launched movement to strive for the title of "Communist Labor Team" is particularly representative in this regard. What is the essence of this movement? What are the characteristics of the "Communist Labor Team"? First of all, it lies in the fact that the people participating in the labor team must ensure the highest labor productivity. This does not depend on the excessive tension of physical strength and energy, but on better organization of labor, full utilization of technology and socialist mutual assistance and cooperation of staff, and technological improvement and perfection.

    In the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, the increase in the proportion of people directly participating in the process of creating material materials in society, as well as the qualitative changes in people themselves, are powerful driving forces for the rapid development of productive forces and the improvement of labor productivity. These also create necessary prerequisites for increasing the free time of all laborers, thereby creating favorable conditions for their spiritual development, and for the all-round development of the main productive force of society—people.

    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy stipulates further improving the people's living standards. Improve people's material welfare. The signs of improving labor conditions and creating the possibility of all-round spiritual development for laborers are shortening the working day. As everyone knows, in 1960, all workers and staff will be transferred to a seven-hour working day in order to transition to a five-to-six-hour working day in the following years. All these together will promote the all-round development of personality under the conditions of comprehensively developing communist construction; this makes the entire society and every staff member more concerned about maximizing labor productivity and making the most of all human abilities. Improving people's living standards and shortening the working day are undoubtedly new and important driving forces for the development of socialist productive forces.

    The characteristics of the period of comprehensive development of communist construction are the further development and improvement of the two forms of public ownership, and the gradual approach of collective ownership to public ownership by the whole people.

    Now let us take a look at what changes are taking place in the production relations system. As mentioned above, the foundation of production relations is the relationship between people and the means of production. In socialist society, public ownership of the means of production—state or public ownership by the whole people and cooperative collective farm ownership—completely dominates. The characteristics of the period of comprehensive development of communist construction are the further development and improvement of the two forms of public ownership.

    Speaking of public ownership by the whole people, its development depends on the vigorous development of socialist industry. As everyone knows, industrial production will almost double in the next seven years. The development of public ownership by the whole people in agriculture is primarily related to the expansion of state farms. State farms now produce about 40% of the country's total grain production. At the end of the seven years, the proportion of public ownership by the whole people in the national economy will also increase greatly.

    At the same time, cooperative collective farm ownership will also be consolidated and developed, and the collective farm system has proven itself to be full of vitality. But even now, all the possibilities hidden in this system have not been completely revealed, such as stimulating the development of productive forces in collective farm villages, improving labor productivity, increasing grain yield per unit area, and increasing animal husbandry product rates. Now all the factors of production are concentrated in the collective farms, which creates all the conditions for the rapid development of collective farm productive forces.

    Developing cooperative collective farm ownership under the conditions of comprehensively developing communist construction presupposes that it will gradually approach public ownership by the whole people. The approach of the two forms of public ownership is carried out in the following basic directions: First, rapidly increase the public funds that become the property basis of collective farms; at the same time, as the experience of communist construction proves, the growth of public funds particularly strongly relies on the accumulation of modern tools of labor, such as tractors, combine harvesters, cultivation, and harvesting machines. Second, make the animal husbandry of collective farms flourish rapidly. Third, develop the construction of production buildings, canteens, clubs, etc. Finally, accumulate current monetary funds, without which modern large-scale socialist economy cannot develop normally. The public funds of collective farms are little different from public ownership by the whole people in terms of their role in the social relations system. There is no doubt that the further development and consolidation of public funds is the most important condition for the cooperative collective farm property to become the public wealth of the future communist society.

    To bring the two forms of public ownership closer, we must first attract the strength and funds of collective farm members to work with state-owned enterprises to serve not only the needs of collective farm members, but also the needs of the rest of the residents. With the increasing prosperity of collective farms, they invest their funds in the construction of bridges and roads in the region, the construction of inter-collective farm power stations, schools, and hospitals, and the construction of radio relay lines and relay stations in areas that already have television. All this shows that the property of collective farms is gradually serving the needs of all working people, that is, playing the same role as public ownership by the whole people. There is no doubt that new enterprises and cultural institutions will be built more and more widely in the future based on the joint use of state and collective farm funds. Finally, due to the development of collective farm production and the increase in income obtained from collective farm production, it will be less and less beneficial for collective farm members to retain their sideline occupations. Hundreds of collective farm members already prefer to hand over their livestock to the collective farm, because they have obtained all the necessary livestock products from the public economy. The time is coming when even vegetable gardens will become a burden to collective farm members, and at that time, collective farm members will obtain all the necessary vegetables from the collective farm and still have a surplus. It is simply meaningless for collective farm members to run their own sideline occupations.

    This is the basic direction on which cooperative collective farm ownership approaches public ownership by the whole people.

    During the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, commodity-money relations and all socialist economic laws, especially the law of distribution according to work, will continue to play a role.

    During the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, commodity production still exists and continues to play an important role due to the existence of cooperative collective farm ownership and the social division of labor. The period of comprehensive development of communist society does not require the elimination of commodity production. The upsurge of collective farm production will undoubtedly mean an increase in commodity products and an expansion of commodity-money relations in rural areas and the entire country. The development of such commodity-money relations does not conflict with the acceleration of communist construction, because commodity production in the Soviet Union is a special kind of commodity production without exploitation relations. The development of this production strengthens public ownership and stimulates production, so it plays a beneficial role in the construction of communist society.

    An important feature of production relations at the present stage is that essential differences are still preserved between urban and rural areas, between mental and physical labor, between skilled and unskilled labor, between light and heavy labor, and so on. The period of comprehensive development of communist construction and the recent seven years will be of great significance for eliminating these differences. Strengthening the technical basis in agriculture, the gradual approach of the two forms of public ownership, and the improvement of the cultural level of rural areas will bring cities and villages closer and closer, and will rapidly eliminate the essential differences still preserved between urban and rural areas and between mental and physical labor. The characteristics inherited from the past era that explain the old social division of labor will gradually be eliminated. In the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, these characteristics have not completely disappeared, but the main and basic things to overcome them will occur.

    During the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, all socialist economic laws, especially the principle of distribution according to work, and distribution according to the quantity and quality of labor, continue to play a role. Consistent adherence to this principle is an important condition for the rapid development of society towards communism. However, as early as under the socialist system, factors preparing for the gradual transition to the communist principle of distribution are taking shape and becoming increasingly consolidated.

    Now, measures in health care, medical facilities, social security, education for children and youth, and a considerable number of cultural facilities are no longer implemented according to the socialist principle (distribution according to work), but are implemented by free methods. Regarding this, N. S. Khrushchev said: "We have genuine communist methods to improve the living welfare of the working people and create good living conditions for the whole society, including everyone. This includes: ensuring that people have well-equipped housing, organizing public catering, improving services for people's lives, expanding the network of child welfare institutions, perfecting national education, arranging rest, and improving medical facilities for residents, building cultural institutions, etc." In the communist process in our country, all these communist factors will grow and expand and develop into building complete communism.

    A characteristic of socialist production relations is the close cooperation of various socialist countries, which ensures the roughly simultaneous transition of all socialist countries to communism.

    An important feature of socialist production relations is the close economic cooperation between socialist countries. This cooperation is not determined by temporary economic conditions, but arises from the essence of socialist relations.

    As early as in capitalist society, the development of productive forces and the manifestation of the social nature of production have at a certain stage made the capitalist economy form a world system, turning individual capitalist countries into a link in this system. The development of economic ties between individual capitalist countries and the emergence of the international division of labor are undoubtedly progressive phenomena. However, this phenomenon is only realized in an antagonistic form, followed by the strengthening of the unbalanced development of national economies and the enslavement of underdeveloped countries by imperialist countries.

    In the socialist mode of production, public ownership of the means of production is compatible with the social nature of production. This mode of production has become more worldwide than the capitalist mode of production. Only here is there no antagonism peculiar to the capitalist world. The law of planned and proportionate development of production replaces the law of unbalanced capitalist economic and political development in the era of imperialism and occupies a dominant position in the world socialist system. Close cooperation between socialist countries ensures the coordinated development of the entire socialist camp. Help countries with lower production levels to improve to the level of advanced countries. If unbalanced economic development is inherent in capitalism, then the characteristic of socialism is balanced economic development, which ensures the roughly simultaneous transition of all socialist countries to communism.

    Therefore, the cooperation of socialist countries is inevitable and is the law of development of socialist countries. At a certain stage in the construction of a completely communist society, this cooperation will enable all socialist countries to converge into a unified and organized economy managed according to the principles of democratic centralism. Only nationalists believe that this or that socialist country should be different from other socialist countries, to build socialism and move towards communism alone. Leninism starts from this point: as batches of new countries break away from the capitalist world, the new world—the socialist world—will be further expanded and consolidated, and the prerequisite for the socialist world is the interrelation and close cooperation of all nations freed from exploitation.

    At present, all countries in the socialist camp are achieving close cooperation in developing their economies and cultures. The coordination and mutual collaboration of economic construction plans have become the law of development for all countries in the socialist camp. The economic cooperation of socialist countries can be illustrated by such figures. For example, last year, in 1958, the foreign trade turnover of various countries participating in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance increased by 1.5 times compared with 1950. As early as 1957, about 75% of the machines, equipment, fuel, pig iron, and fertilizers needed for import by the countries participating in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance were satisfied by commodity exchanges within the socialist camp. The characteristic of the economic development of socialist countries at the present stage is that agreements in commodity circulation are no longer for a period of one year, but for a long time. This enables all socialist countries to plan the development of their economies more rationally.

    The economic cooperation of socialist countries is carried out in accordance with the policy of increasingly close coordination and cooperation of the national economic development plans of socialist countries. Therefore, all countries in the socialist camp have formulated long-term plans for the next ten to fifteen years, creating the possibility for the coordination of long-term economic development plans. Close cooperation between socialist countries can rationally realize the new international division of labor in the socialist camp. This division of labor can enable socialist countries to accelerate their development. The international division of labor of socialist countries that is gradually forming is most clearly manifested in the specialization and coordination of production related to it. For example, as everyone knows, Poland's coal industry is developed taking into account the needs of the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia; Hungary's aluminum industry and the Soviet Union's petroleum industry are developed taking into account the needs of other countries in the socialist camp. The economy of socialist countries developed on the basis of close cooperation between socialist countries does not know what production anarchy and crisis are, and it provides a new and powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in socialist society.

    These are the most important features of the development of socialist production relations at the present stage of communist construction. The changes in the productive forces and production relations of socialist society have increased and improved the adaptation of production relations to the nature of productive forces, thereby opening up broad prospects for their further development.

    全面展开共产主义建设时期
    生产力和生产关系的发展
    苏联　德·契斯诺科夫
    一、社会主义制度下的生产力和生产关系
    在社会主义制度下，同生产的社会性相适应的生产资料公有制，为生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的活动场所。因为在这些条件下，社会的有计划发展代替了生产的无政府状态和危机，为自己、也为整个社会而工作的人们的同志合作代替了阶级冲突。
    生产资料公有制是社会主义生产关系的基础。社会主义生产力的发展巩固了生产资料公有制，改进了社会主义所有制形式。因此，一方面是生产力的发展，而另一方面，是同这种生产力相适应的生产关系的巩固和完善。
    这是不是说，社会主义的生产力和生产关系之间没有任何矛盾呢？不。在发展过程的某个阶段，生产的个别方面不可避免地要产生不相适应的状态，因而在它们之间也会产生矛盾。没有矛盾就没有生活、没有发展。社会主义的生产也完全是这种情况。在社会主义制度下，生产力也是生产的最活动、最革命的因素。生产力的变化非常迅速，生产关系的某些方面往往来不及适应日益增长的生产力的要求。
    在这个基础上，矛盾就不可避免地产生，同时也不断得到解决。例如，社会主义生产力的发展不可能同资本主义社会遗留下来的分工形式长期并存。大家知道，在资本主义制度下，城乡之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的矛盾达到极其尖锐的程度。社会主义革命和社会主义制度的胜利消除了这个对立面的对抗性。可是，它们之间的本质差别还是存在。社会主义生产力的发展就要求消除这些本质差别。
    社会主义工农业中生产力的增长引起了这样一种情况：通过国家企业（机器拖拉机站）在技术上为集体农庄服务的办法，过去曾起了积极的作用，而现在已经过时了。为了有利于农村社会主义生产的发展，就必须把一切生产要素都集中在集体农民手里，即集中在集体农庄本身。党和政府估计到这一点，通过了关于改组机器拖拉机站和进一步巩固集体农庄、集体农庄所有制，首先是公积金的决议。
    在社会主义社会，消费品的分配主要通过商品货币关系来实现。社会主义制度下的商品货币关系，在质的方面具有与资本主义制度下的商品货币关系不同的新的本质，它对社会主义社会的发展起着重大作用。商品货币关系是社会主义生产关系不可分割的必要方面。目前，我们不能没有货币，没有商品。但是毫无疑问，随着生产力的进一步发展，消费品将得到充分保证，而合作社集体农庄公有制形式将同全民所有制溶为一体，那时商品货币关系就不再对生产力的发展起积极作用，它们将同新的更高的生产力发展水平发生矛盾。为了使共产主义社会得到更顺利的发展，就必须按照人们的需要，用直接分配产品的办法来代替商品货币关系。因此，在这一方面，在社会发展的某一阶段，即当社会主义发展到高级阶段——共产主义时，商品货币关系也就成为阻碍人类社会生产力发展的因素。这个矛盾要通过消除商品货币关系，即用共产主义的产品交换代替商品货币关系的办法来解决。
    在社会主义制度下，生产和消费的相互关系对生产的发展具有极重要的意义。由于在社会主义制度下生产和消费的相互关系失去了对抗性（因为生产是直接为了满足社会主义社会劳动者的社会需要和个人需要），这种相互作用的本身就成了推动生产力发展的有力因素。
    生产力的发展使社会主义社会的人们产生了新的需要，并且提供一切新的物质资料来满足这些需要。同时，摆脱了剥削的人们的社会需要发展得非常迅速，往往使生产来不及满足这些需要。但是，这种矛盾不具有对抗性。它随着社会主义生产力的加速发展而不断得到解决。
    生产关系的必要的变化，随着这种变化所必需的物质前提的成熟而实现。跳越生产力发展的具体阶段，或者同生产力水平相脱节，只会阻碍社会向共产主义前进的运动。例如，在现阶段，从商品货币关系过渡到直接的产品交换的条件还没有成熟。为了加速共产主义建设和保证这种过渡的实现，就不仅需要发展社会的物质技术基础，取得丰富的物质资料，而且还要改进商业工作，巩固苏维埃卢布，在所有工农企业中运用经济核算原则等等。
    二、从社会主义向共产主义过渡条件下的生产力和生产关系
    目前，苏维埃社会已进入全面展开共产主义建设的时期。这个时期最重要的任务就是：建立共产主义的物质技术基础；进一步提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平；为消除城乡之间、公有制的两种形式之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的本质差别准备条件；全面发展苏维埃人，并培养他们不通过国家来管理共产主义社会的能力。
    当然，这个时期生产关系同生产力相互作用的性质还是同社会主义社会发展的过去阶段的性质一样：生产关系适应生产力的性质。但是也具有同今天共产主义因素的出现和发展有联系的新的因素。
    生产中的这些变化表现在哪里呢？
    在今后几年内，生产资料，首先是劳动工具方面将发生巨大的变化，将要建立新的工业部门
    先从生产力说起。社会生产力由两个主要因素组成：包括生产的物质技术资料的劳动工具（即工业企业、运输、国营农场和集体农庄中的物质技术资料和劳动工具、原料、生产上所必要的各种辅助材料）和利用劳动工具进行物质资料生产的人。在今后几年内，生产资料，首先是劳动工具方面将发生巨大的变化，在建立共产主义物质技术基础方面将完成决定性的步骤。在今后七年内，将建立数万个新的工业企业，扩建并用现代技术重新装备数千个工厂、矿井和矿山等等。但是，劳动工具方面的主要变化将不只是在量的方面，而且还表现在质的方面。社会主义工业和运输业的发展将在争取技术进步的标志下实现。机器制造业企业的全部车床将得到更新；铁路和水道将被改建；新的、更有效的内燃机车和电动机车将在全国铁路上出现。七年计划中技术进步的最重要的一个指标就是生产的自动化和遥控化，以及繁重劳动过程的机械化。在发展工业方面，苏联所采取的方针不仅是基本生产过程，而且还包括辅助生产过程的机械化，挖掘一切潜力以实现工业、运输业以及建筑业中的全盘机械化。目前，从某些工段的部分自动化过渡到生产过程全盘自动化，并且适当地过渡到建立全面自动化车间和企业的条件已经成熟。在电站、机器制造工业、化学工业、石油工业以及食品工业中，实现生产过程自动化具有特别有利的条件。机器制造工业为了实现苏共第二十一次代表大会所提出的生产过程全盘机械化和自动化的任务，在今后七年内必须生产出能够保证我国国民经济获得机械化和自动化高效能工具的装备。
    在农业生产方面，实现生产过程机械化的潜力特别巨大，因为手工劳动还占了相当大的比重。今后七年内，农业生产力一定要有巨大的跃进。这就要求社会主义工业为畜牧业以及过去占用大量人力的农业劳动（如装卸工作以及其他一些工作）的机械化提供必要的装备。耕作工具也必须大力改进。
    共产主义建设应以大规模扩大社会的动力基地为前提。在七年计划期间，苏联将实现建立电站的宏伟纲领。可是，这还没有给我们提供建立共产主义物质技术基础一切必要的条件。要完成这个任务还需要经过若干年。
    最后在全面展开共产主义建设时期，劳动工具的发展和完善的先决条件是建立新的工业部门。没有新的工业部门，共产主义物质技术基础是很难想像的。愈往后去，化学工业及其所有部门愈将在生产中起巨大的作用。化学能创造新材料，这些材料在质量上比自然界原来就存在的、而且为现代生产所必需的金属、矿物和纤维还要好。化学工业无论在提高单位面积产量、增加畜牧业产品量以及发展国家动力基地方面都起着日益重大的作用。苏共中央六月全会对顺利完成七年计划第一年的任务做了总结，并且制订了完成和超额完成七年计划的具体措施。苏共中央全会特别重视加强作为顺利完成七年计划的决定性条件的国民经济中的技术进步的斗争，特别重视全盘机械化和生产自动化，提高科学在发展生产中的作用，国民经济的进一步专业化和协作，最后，还注意到现有企业的改建、扩大和重新装备。
    历史性的全会决议详细而具体地说明了七年计划的任务，揭示了社会主义国民经济中蕴藏着的难以数计的潜力，指出了最迅速地实现七年计划的途径。技术进步、全盘机械化和生产自动化，将全力促进劳动生产率的进一步提高，这就是共产主义取得最终胜利的决定性条件。
    生产力的发展不仅仅限于劳动工具的变化。高度生产力水平的指标之一，是原料、辅助材料和其他生产资料的积累，没有这些东西，人和劳动工具就不能在生产过程中发生作用。在全面展开共产主义建设时期，黑色金属和有色金属的生产急骤增长。为了使制造新的劳动工具和日常用品的机器制造业能够不断地进行生产，就必须有大量金属储备。为了发展化学工业，就需要大量原料：石油、炼油残渣、煤气。石油和煤气是工厂、发电站的燃料，同时也是化学工业的宝贵的原料。在今后七年内，所有这些原料和辅助材料的生产都将急骤地增长。
    在共产主义建设过程中，直接创造物质资料的人的比重逐渐增加，共产主义社会全面发展的人正在形成
    生产力的另一个组成因素是人。在共产主义建设过程中，直接创造物质资料的人的比重逐渐增加。社会主义的胜利和剥削阶级的消灭使社会的成员变成了社会主义的积极劳动者。但是在初期阶段，社会主义社会不得不用极大的力量来培养自己的知识分子，其中一部分不直接参加物质资料的生产。工人阶级掌握了政权，但是没有自己的知识分子，没有自己的知识分子就不能管理生产和管理社会，就不能提高人民的文化水平。因此不得不在从资本主义到社会主义的整个过渡时期中，从工人和农民中培养自己的知识分子。中等和高等学校基本上都使自己的工作服从于这一任务。一部分中等学校的毕业生一出学校就直接参加了生产；颇大一部分青年甚至没有受完七年制教育就走上生产岗位。
    现在我们面临着全面展开建设共产主义的任务，整个国民教育系统的方向就是培养共产主义社会的全面发展的劳动者，有教养的熟练的工作人员，要使他们从八年制学校，尤其是完全中等学校毕业后能立即参加生产。由于这样，不仅会大大改进全国干部的培养，而且还增加了直接创造物质资料的这一部分劳动者的比重。
    作为社会集团的知识分子来说，数量上不是在减少，相反是在增长。但是同创造物质资料和精神资料的过程不相联系的那一部分知识分子的比重，正在减少。一方面，管理机关大大减少，并且越往后就越少。另一方面，随着社会物质技术基础的发展，直接参加物质资料的创造的生产技术知识分子的比重，正在增加。像科学这种专门从事脑力劳动的部门的代表者越来越积极地参加着物质生产过程。因为在现代技术水平条件下，不单是工长、工程师、工段长参加了生产过程，各种不同的工厂实验室，甚至研究所的科学工作人员，也都成为生产过程的必要的一分子。他们不断地分析工艺过程的各个环节，为这一过程制定新的方案，并把它运用到生产中去，设计新的器械，并检查它们的发挥作用的情况。在农业生产中也是同样的情况，农艺师、饲养员、兽医、机械师等等都是物质资料创造过程的最直接的参加者。
  以上我们所谈的都是关于问题的量的方面，就是指直接从事创造物质财富的各部门的人的数量增加过程。质的方面也一样重要。在全面展开共产主义建设时期，人的全面发展过程正在迅速地进行着。生产中的工作人员不但创造着物质财富，还不断地提高着自己的普通教育水平、文化水平，完成了中等教育，许多人还完成了高等教育。社会主义社会劳动者的文化要求日益增长，对待日常生活的新的社会主义的态度越来越普遍起来。在我们的时代，未来共产主义社会的全面发展的人正在形成。这种情况对于进一步提高劳动生产率有着巨大的意义。从国家观点出发对待自己的劳动、对待技术的全面发展的人，为最迅速地提高劳动生产率打开了新的源泉和新的可能性。
    最近展开的争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的运动，在这方面是特别有代表性的。这个运动的实质在哪里呢？“共产主义劳动队”的特点是什么呢？首先就在于：参加劳动队的人必须保证有最高的劳动生产率。这不是依赖于体力和精力的过分紧张，而是更好地组织劳动，充分利用技术和工作人员的社会主义互助合作、技术的改进和完善。
    在全面展开共产主义建设时期，社会上直接参加到创造物质资料过程中去的人的比重的增长，以及人本身的质的变化，都是迅速发展生产力、提高劳动生产率的强大推动力。而这些也为增加全体劳动者的自由时间，从而给他们精神上的发展创造有利条件，为社会的主要生产力——人的全面发展，创造必要的前提。
    苏联发展国民经济的七年计划规定进一步提高人民的生活水平。提高人们的物质福利。改善劳动条件和创造劳动者精神上全面发展的可能性的标志，就是缩短劳动日。大家知道，1960年全体工人和职员将转为七小时工作日，以便在以后的年代中过渡到五至六小时工作日。所有这些合在一起，将促进全面展开共产主义建设条件下个性的全面发展；这使整个社会和每个工作人员更加关心最大限度地提高劳动生产率，最充分地利用人的一切能力。提高人民的生活水平和缩短工作日，无疑是社会主义生产力发展的新的重要推动力。
    全面展开共产主义建设时期的特点是公有制两种形式的进一步发展和完善，集体所有制逐步接近全民所有制
    现在我们来看一看生产关系体系中发生着什么变化。正如上面所说，生产关系的基础是人与生产资料的关系。在社会主义社会，生产资料公有制——国家或全民所有制和合作社集体农庄所有制——完全占统治地位。全面展开共产主义建设时期的特点是公有制两种形式的进一步发展和完善。
    谈到全民所有制，它的发展决定于社会主义工业的大力发展，大家知道，工业生产在今后七年内几乎将增加一倍。农业中全民所有制的发展首先同国营农场的扩大相联系，现在国营农场所生产的谷物约为全国谷物生产总量的40％。在七年终了时，全民所有制在国家经济中所占的比重还将大大增加。
    同时合作社集体农庄所有制也将巩固和发展，集体农庄制度证明自己是生气蓬勃的。但是即使在现在，也还没有彻底揭示出这个制度所蕴藏的一切可能性，如刺激集体农庄乡村生产力的发展、提高劳动生产率、增加谷物单位面积产量和畜牧业产品率。现在所有生产要素都集中在集体农庄，这就为集体农庄生产力的迅速发展创造了一切条件。
    在全面展开共产主义建设的条件下发展合作社集体农庄所有制，就预先要使它逐渐接近全民所有制。公有制两种形式的接近是按照下列基本方向进行的：第一，迅速增加成为集体农庄财产基础的公积金；同时，正如共产主义建设的经验所证明，公积金的增长特别强烈地依靠现代劳动工具，如拖拉机、联合收割机、耕种和收割机器等的积累。第二，使集体农庄的畜牧业迅速繁荣。第三，发展生产建筑物、食堂、俱乐部等的建设。最后，积累流动货币资金，缺乏这种资金，现代大规模社会主义经济就不能正常发展。集体农庄的公积金按它在社会关系体系中的作用来说，同全民所有制很少区别。不必怀疑，公积金的进一步发展和巩固是合作社集体农庄财产变为未来共产主义社会的全民的财富的最重要条件。
    要使公有制两种形式相接近，就先要吸引集体农庄庄员的力量和资金与国营企业一道不但为集体农庄庄员的需要服务，也为其余的居民服务。随着集体农庄的日渐富裕，它们把自己的资金投入本地区桥梁和道路的建设，集体农庄间发电站、学校、医院的建设，以及已经有电视的地区的无线电继电线路和转播站的建设。这一切说明，集体农庄的财产正逐渐地为全体劳动人民的需要服务，也就是起着同全民所有制一样的作用。不必怀疑，将来将日益广泛地在共同利用国家和集体农庄资金的基础上建设新的企业和文化机构。最后，由于集体农庄生产的发展和从集体农庄生产中所获得的收入的增加，对于集体农庄庄员来说，保留自己的副业越往后将越得不到好处。现在已经有千百个集体农庄的庄员宁愿把牲畜交给集体农庄，因为他们从公共经济中得到了一切必需的畜产品。这样的时期就要来到了，那时连菜园都成为集体农庄庄员的累赘，那时集体农庄庄员将从集体农庄获得一切必需的蔬菜而且还有剩余。经营自己的副业对于集体农庄庄员简直就毫无意义了。
    这就是合作社集体农庄所有制接近全民所有制所依据的基本方向。
    全面展开共产主义建设时期，商品货币关系和社会主义的一切经济规律，特别是按劳分配规律会继续发生作用
    在全面展开共产主义建设时期，由于合作社集体农庄所有制和社会分工的存在，商品生产仍旧保留着并且继续起重要作用。全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期并不要求消灭商品生产。集体农庄生产的高涨无疑地将意味着商品产品的增加以及农村和整个国家商品货币关系的扩大。这种商品货币关系的发展同加速共产主义建设并不发生矛盾，因为苏联的商品生产，是没有剥削关系的特种商品生产。这种生产的发展加强着公有制，刺激着生产，因此在共产主义社会的建设中起着有益的作用。
    现阶段生产关系的重要特点是：城乡之间，脑力劳动和体力劳动之间，熟练劳动和不熟练劳动、轻劳动和重劳动等等之间还保存着本质的差别。全面展开共产主义建设的时期和最近的七年对于消灭这些差别将有重大的意义。农业中技术基础的加强，公有制两种形式的逐渐接近，农村文化水平的提高，将使城市和乡村越来越接近，将迅速消灭城乡之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间还保存着的本质差别。从过去的时代继承下来的、说明旧的社会分工的特点，将逐渐被消灭。在全面展开共产主义建设时期，这些特点还没有完全消失，但是将克服它们的主要的和基本的东西。
    在全面展开共产主义建设时期，社会主义的一切经济规律，特别是按劳分配、按劳动数量和质量分配的原则继续发生作用。一贯遵守这个原则是社会向共产主义迅速发展的重要条件。但是早在社会主义制度下，准备向共产主义分配原则逐步过渡的因素就在形成起来并日益巩固。
    现在，保健事业、医疗设施、社会保证、儿童和青年的教育方面和相当多的文化设施方面的措施已经不是按社会主义原则（按劳分配）来实行，而是按免费的办法实行的。关于这方面尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫说：“我们有提高劳动人民生活福利和为整个社会、也包括为每一个人创造美好生活条件的真正共产主义的方法。这里包括：保证人们有设备良好的住宅，组织公共饮食业，改进对人的生活服务，扩大儿童福利机构网，使国民教育趋于完善，安排休息和改进对居民的医疗设施，建设文化机构等等。”在我国共产主义过程中，所有这些共产主义因素都将增长和扩大，并发展成为建设完全的共产主义。
    社会主义生产关系的特点是各个社会主义国家的密切合作，这种紧密的合作保证所有社会主义国家大致同时过渡到共产主义
    社会主义生产关系的重要特点是社会主义各国密切的经济合作。这种合作并不是由一时的经济情况所决定，而是出于社会主义关系的本质。
    早在资本主义社会，生产力的发展，生产社会性的显露已在一定阶段上使资本主义经济形成为世界体系，使个别资本主义国家变成这个体系的一环。个别资本主义国家之间经济联系的发展和国际分工的产生无疑是进步的现象。但是这种现象只是以对抗性形式实现的，随之而来的是国家经济发展不平衡现象的加强和帝国主义国家奴役不发达国家。
    在社会主义生产方式中生产资料公有制同生产社会性相适应，这种生产方式比资本主义生产方式更多地获得了世界性。只有这里才没有资本主义世界所特有的对抗性。生产有计划按比例发展规律代替帝国主义时期的资本主义经济和政治发展不平衡规律而在世界社会主义体系中占统治地位。社会主义国家的紧密合作保证着整个社会主义阵营的协调一致的发展。帮助生产水平较低的国家提高到先进国家的水平。如果经济发展不平衡是资本主义所固有的，那么社会主义的特点就是经济的平衡发展，这保证所有社会主义国家大致同时过渡到共产主义。
    因此，社会主义国家的合作是必然的，是社会主义国家的发展规律。在建设完全的共产主义社会的一定阶段上，这种合作使所有社会主义国家汇合成按照民主集中制原则进行管理的统一的有组织的经济。只有民族主义者才认为，这个或那个社会主义国家应该与其他社会主义国家不同，要单独建设社会主义和走向共产主义。列宁主义是从这一点出发的：随着一批批新的国家脱离资本主义世界，新的世界——社会主义世界将更加扩大和巩固，而社会主义世界的先决条件是摆脱了剥削的各民族的相互联系和紧密合作。
    现在，社会主义阵营所有国家都在发展经济和文化方面相互取得紧密的合作。经济建设计划的配合和相互协作已成为社会主义阵营各国发展的规律。社会主义国家的经济合作，可以用这样一些数字来说明，例如，去年，1958年，参加经济互助委员会的各个国家的对外贸易流转额，比1950年增加一点五倍。早在1957年，参加经济互助委员会的各国所需要输入的机器、装备、燃料、生铁、肥料约75％是靠社会主义阵营内部的商品交换来满足的。社会主义国家经济发展现阶段的特点是：商品流转方面的协定已经不是为期一年，而是长时期的。这样使所有社会主义国家可以更合理地计划自己经济的发展。
    社会主义国家的经济合作是按照社会主义国家国民经济发展计划的日益紧密的协调和配合的方针进行的。因此社会主义阵营所有国家制定了最近十至十五年的远景计划，为长时期的经济发展计划的配合创造了可能性。社会主义国家的紧密合作能够合理地实现社会主义阵营的新的国际分工。这种分工可以使得社会主义国家加速发展。逐渐形成的社会主义国家的国际分工最明显地表现在专业化和同它相联系的生产的协调方面。例如，大家知道，波兰的煤炭工业是估计到德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的需要来发展的；匈牙利的制铝工业和苏联的石油工业是估计到社会主义阵营其他国家的需要来发展的。在社会主义国家紧密合作的基础上发展起来的社会主义国家的经济，不知道什么是生产无政府状态和危机，它对社会主义社会生产力的发展提供了新的强大的推动力。
    这就是在共产主义建设的现阶段社会主义生产关系发展的最重要的特点。社会主义社会生产力和生产关系所发生的变化增进了并且改善了生产关系对生产力性质的适应，从而为它们的进一步发展展开了广阔的远景。
