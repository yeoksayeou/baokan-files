Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, August 5th: The Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held its official opening session in Hiroshima this evening. Seventy-three representatives from twenty-four countries and nine international organizations, along with ten thousand Japanese representatives, attended the conference.

    The conference elected a presidium of forty-two people, including Soviet representative Kovalev, American representative Dr. Pauling, and Japanese representative Shigeo Takayama.

    Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, delivered a report at the conference. He said that the demand to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs has transcended the boundaries of different ideologies, beliefs, and social systems, and has become the unanimous opinion of all countries. However, there is a force that opposes peace and implements a "policy of strength" at all costs, which is a very dangerous trend. He pointed out that strengthening military alliances and implementing nuclear armament policies are manifestations of this dangerous trend.

    Yasui Kaoru emphasized that, under these circumstances, the World Conference must take "East-West reconciliation, banning atomic and hydrogen bombs" as its basic principle, and must raise the issue of abolishing hostile military alliances and studying the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." At the same time, it must discuss the issue of concluding a collective security treaty including both East and West.

    Yasui Kaoru suggested launching a movement to rescue atomic bomb victims through the conference.

    Soviet representative Kovalev and American representative Dr. Pauling, in their speeches, both emphasized the need to sign an international agreement banning nuclear testing.

    Next, Hiroko Okamura (transliteration), an atomic bomb victim from Hiroshima City, spoke at the conference. She called for a ban on nuclear weapons and not to let the Hiroshima tragedy repeat itself.

    Qin Fuzushanfan, the representative from Okinawa, who participated in the peace parade, spoke at the conference. He called for the abolition of the Okinawan New Criminal Law, which suppresses the Okinawan people, and the return of Okinawa to Japan.

    Mayor Shinzo Hamai of Hiroshima City, in his speech, expressed his desire to make Hiroshima a city of peace.

    The leaders of the three peace march teams, including Atsushi Nishimoto, who departed from Tokyo, Niigata, and Yoron Island in mid-June, traveled for fifty-six days, and only arrived in Hiroshima yesterday, also spoke at the conference.

    The conference read out congratulatory telegrams to the Hiroshima World Conference from Soviet Premier Khrushchev, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Iraqi Premier Kassem, and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace.

    In order to undermine the World Conference, the Kishi Nobusuke government actually instigated Japanese fascists this afternoon to break into the residences of representatives from various countries to intimidate them, unreasonably demanding that the World Conference not discuss the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which is related to the peace of Asia and the world, and insulting representatives from various countries. When representatives from Tokyo and other Kanto areas arrived in Hiroshima, fascist elements even beat peace fighters. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government's sabotage activities did not prevent the World Conference from proceeding as scheduled. The conference held a plenary session at 7:00 p.m. this evening according to the original plan and concluded successfully at 10:00 p.m.

    The conference will hold a peace memorial rally tomorrow and hold group meetings on issues such as banning nuclear weapons and strengthening the peace movement.

    禁止原子弹和氢弹！不许广岛惨剧重演！
    禁止氢弹世界大会正式会议开幕
    新华社5日讯　广岛消息：第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会今天傍晚在广岛举行正式会议。二十四个国家和九个国际组织的七十三位代表以及日本代表一万人出席了大会。
    大会选出苏联代表科瓦廖夫、美国代表保林博士和日本代表山高繁等四十二人为主席团。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在大会上作报告。他说，禁止原子弹和氢弹的要求已经超越不同思想、信仰和社会制度的范围，而成为所有国家的一致舆论。但是，有一种力量在反对和平，不顾一切地执行“实力政策”，这是非常危险的动向。他指出，加强军事联盟和执行核武装政策就是这种危险动向的表现。
    安井郁强调指出，在这种形势下，世界大会必须把“东西方和解、禁止原子弹和氢弹”作为基本方针，并且必须提出废除敌对军事联盟的问题和研究修改日美“安全条约”问题。同时，必须讨论缔结包括东西方在内的集体安全条约问题。
    安井郁建议通过大会展开救援原子弹受害者的运动。
    苏联代表科瓦廖夫和美国代表保林博士在会上致词时，都强调必须签订禁止核试验的国际协定。
    接着，广岛市原子弹受害者冈村浩子（译音）在会上讲话。她呼吁禁止核武器，不要使广岛惨剧重演。
    参加和平大游行的冲绳岛代表亲富祖善繁在会上讲话，他呼吁废除镇压冲绳人民的冲绳新刑法，把冲绳归还给日本。
    广岛市市长滨井信三在会上致词时，表示要使广岛成为一个和平城市。
    6月中从东京、新澙与论岛出发走了五十六天在昨日才到达广岛的和平大游行三路队伍的领导人西本敦等人，也在会上讲了话。
    大会宣读了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫、印度总理尼赫鲁、伊拉克总理卡塞姆以及中国人民保卫世界和平委员会给广岛世界大会的贺电。
    岸信介政府为了破坏世界大会，今天下午竟唆使日本法西斯分子闯进各国代表的住处进行恫吓，无理要求世界大会不要讨论关系着亚洲及世界和平的修改日美“安全条约”问题，并且侮辱各国代表。当东京等关东地方代表到达广岛时，法西斯分子竟殴打了和平战士。但是，岸信介政府的破坏活动并没有阻挡住世界大会的如期进行。大会在今晚七时按原订计划举行了全体会议，并且在晚十时胜利结束。
    大会将在明天举行和平纪念集会，并且就禁止核武器和加强和平运动等问题举行分组会议。
