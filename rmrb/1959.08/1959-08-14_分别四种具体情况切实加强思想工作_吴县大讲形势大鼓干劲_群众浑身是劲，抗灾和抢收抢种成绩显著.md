Strengthening Ideological Work Based on Four Specific Situations
Wuxian County Gives Talks on the Situation to Boost Enthusiasm
Masses Full of Energy, Remarkable Achievements in Disaster Resistance, Reaping, and Planting

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 13th dispatch) Wuxian County, Jiangsu, is strengthening ideological work in various communes, giving talks on the situation, and boosting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses in order to strive for a comprehensive and large-scale bumper harvest of autumn-ripening crops.

The Wuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in leading the current production movement, particularly emphasizes speaking to cadres and the masses about the situation and doing a good job of ideological work in light of the actual situation. Recently, the county committee comprehensively analyzed the production and work situation of the county's thirty-five communes, and the party committees at all levels formulated ideological work plans based on the specific situations.

The county is roughly divided into four situations: The first is areas with a larger area of double-cropping rice and a larger increase in early rice production; the second is areas with a good foundation in the past, but the increase in summer crops and early rice production this year is not large due to insufficient enthusiasm of the people; the third is areas with a smaller area of double-cropping rice and good development of cash crops and sideline production; and the fourth is areas that are undergoing commune rectification.

In the first type of area, ideological work begins with summarizing the experience of high-yield early rice. Although the overall increase in production in this area is large, it is uneven. Therefore, while summarizing the experience of high yields, the reasons why some fields have not achieved high yields are also found, detailed accounts of balanced increases in production are calculated, and experiences of high and low yields are discussed. Then, according to the current crop growth, measures are studied, actions are organized, and efforts are made to achieve a relatively balanced increase in production in every mu of autumn rice fields. For example, the average yield per mu of early rice in the Qiaotou team of the Miaoqian Brigade of the Guangfu Commune this year is more than 600 jin, while the highest yield per mu of early rice in the Wujiacun team is only 400 jin. If all the rice fields were like the Qiaotou team, the entire commune could increase production by a lot more grain. With this comparison between high and low, and a detailed calculation, cadres and commune members who lacked enthusiasm in the past have examined their shortcomings and are determined to make the intermediate, late rice and late autumn crops a bumper harvest.

In the second type of area, the main focus is on mobilizing the masses to analyze the reasons why the increase in early rice production this year is not large, so as to enlighten cadres and the masses to consciously criticize ideas such as lack of confidence and insufficient enthusiasm, thereby recognizing the situation, boosting revolutionary enthusiasm, studying measures, grasping the later stages of production, and striving for an autumn harvest to make up for the insufficient increase in early rice production.

In the third type of area, the summer distribution is summarized, the reasons for the bumper harvest are analyzed, and the plans for agricultural and sideline production are further revised to set off a new upsurge of production. For example, the Yuexi Commune Party Committee revised the production plan and calculated three accounts for the commune members. The first account is the increase in production from achieving the "three guarantees." The average yield per mu of rice in this commune last year was more than 630 jin. If the guaranteed yield per mu this year is 763 jin, the more than 14,000 mu of rice in the entire commune can increase grain production by more than 1.8 million jin. The second account is the increase in income from developing sideline occupations. The third account is the reduction of costs through diligence and thrift in running the commune. Last year, the average cost per mu of rice was 24 yuan. If it is reduced to 15 yuan per mu this year, the commune's rice fields can save 131,400 yuan in costs. While calculating the accounts, the commune party committee also analyzed the conditions and basis for fulfilling them. After the detailed accounts were calculated, the masses were beaming with joy and full of energy. They reflected: "If you don't calculate, you don't know; calculating makes you laugh. The more you calculate, the more energetic you become, the more you calculate, the happier you become. Now that we work hard, we'll have a sweet harvest in the autumn."

In the fourth type of area, the commune party committee mobilized the masses to summarize the 1958 distribution, study the summer distribution issue and the current production plan, in order to encourage the commune members to have greater enthusiasm, strengthen field management, and powerfully promote the current production.

Because the party committees of the various communes pay attention to strengthening ideological work, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, which has greatly promoted the current production. In the battle against typhoons, preventing floods, preventing droughts, preventing diseases, and controlling insects, remarkable achievements have been made. For example, recently, when rice diseases and insect pests occurred, various localities actively trained technicians and established professional teams to launch a fierce attack on rice diseases and insect pests by means of catching, poisoning, and attracting. By August 4, 539,300 mu of medium and late rice in the county had been sprayed with one to two applications of pesticides. In the sweltering month of July, the cadres and masses of the county promptly reaped all of the more than 100,000 mu of double-cropping early rice. While reaping, watering to preserve seedlings, and combating drought to grab the planting season, the county's late rice was planted seven days earlier than last year. The sowing of late autumn crops is also being carried out in a concentrated manner to seize the time. Collective and individual sideline production of commune members has also greatly developed. After the spring and summer silkworm harvests, the task of raising 36,000 autumn silkworms has been assigned to the teams; the number of pigs and sheep has increased sharply to more than 235,000.

The county is now launching a red flag competition movement of "classifying and establishing pace-setters, classifying and greatly promoting, exceeding work quotas, and exceeding guaranteed production" to strive for balanced growth of every rice seedling and every crop, and to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn.

### 分别四种具体情况切实加强思想工作　吴县大讲形势大鼓干劲　群众浑身是劲，抗灾和抢收抢种成绩显著

　　分别四种具体情况切实加强思想工作
　　吴县大讲形势大鼓干劲
　　群众浑身是劲，抗灾和抢收抢种成绩显著
    本报南京13日电　江苏吴县各个公社加强思想工作，大讲形势，大鼓群众革命干劲，力争秋熟作物全面大丰收。
    中共吴县县委在领导当前生产运动中，特别强调对干部、群众大讲形势，结合实际情况做好思想工作。最近县委把全县三十五个公社的生产、工作情况全面作了分析，各级党委根据具体情况确定了思想工作的计划。
    全县大致分为四种情况：第一种是双季稻面积较多，早稻增产幅度较大的地区；第二种是以往基础较好，但因为人的干劲不足，今年夏熟和早稻增产幅度不大的地区；第三种是双季稻面积较少，经济作物和副业生产开展得好的地区；第四种是正在进行整社的地区。
    在第一种地区，思想工作首先从总结早稻高产经验入手。这种地区虽然总的增产幅度较大，但不平衡，因此，在总结高产经验的同时，也找出有些田亩还没有获得高产的原因，算增产平衡的细账，谈高产、低产的体会，然后按当前作物生长情况，研究措施，组织行动，争取秋田亩亩稻田比较平衡的增产。如光福公社庙前大队桥头小队今年的早稻平均亩产六百斤以上，而吴家村小队的早稻最高亩产量也不过四百斤，如果所有的稻田都像桥头小队一样，全公社就可以多增产许多粮食。这样高低一比，细账算一算，过去干劲不足的干部、社员都纷纷检讨了自己的缺点，下决心要使中、晚稻和晚秋作物丰收。
    第二种情况的地区，主要是通过发动群众分析今年早稻增产幅度不大的原因，从中启发干部和群众自觉的批判信心不强、干劲不足等思想，从而认清形势，鼓起革命干劲，研究措施，抓好后作，争取秋季丰收来弥补早稻增产的不足。
    在第三种地区，通过总结夏季分配，分析丰收的原因，进一步修订农副业生产规划，掀起新的生产高潮。如越溪公社党委通过修订生产规划，向社员算了三笔账。第一笔算的是实现“三包”的增产账。这个公社去年水稻平均单产是六百三十多斤，今年如果实现亩产包产七百六十三斤，全社一万四千多亩水稻，就能增产粮食一百八十多万斤。第二笔算的是发展副业增加收入账。第三笔算的是勤俭办社降低成本账。去年平均每亩水稻成本二十四元，今年如减少到每亩十五元，全社稻田就可节省成本费十三万一千四百元。在算账的同时，公社党委还分析了可以兑现的条件和根据。细账算过后，群众眉飞色舞，浑身来劲。他们反映说：“不算不晓得，算算笑起来，越算越起劲，越算越高兴，现在干得勤，秋后甜津津。”
    在第四种地区，公社党委发动群众总结1958年分配，研究夏季分配问题和当前生产计划，以鼓舞社员的更大干劲，加强田间管理，有力地推动当前生产。
    由于各个公社党委注意加强思想工作，群众干劲很足，大大推动了当前的生产。在抗台风、防涝、防旱、防病、治虫的战斗中，成绩显著。如最近水稻发生病虫害，各地就积极培训技术员，建立专业组，以捕、毒、诱等办法，向水稻病虫发起猛攻。到8月4日止，全县已有五十三万九千三百亩中稻、晚稻喷上了一遍到二遍药剂。在酷热的7月里，全县干部群众及时地把十万多亩双季早稻全部抢割登场。各地在一面收、一面浇水保苗和一面抗旱抢种的情况下，使全县的晚稻比去年提前七天插完。晚秋作物的播种也正在抢时间突击进行。集体和社员个人的副业生产也有很大发展。全县在春、夏两季蚕桑丰收后，三万六千张秋蚕饲养任务已落实到队；猪羊的头数已剧增到二十三万五千多头。
    现在全县正在掀起“分类树标兵，分类大促进，劳动超定额，实产超包产”的红旗竞赛运动，争取亩亩稻苗、项项作物生长平衡，争取秋季大丰收。
