Xinhua News Agency, 21st - In the seventeen provinces and regions of our country that are experiencing drought, many areas have received rainfall since August, alleviating or easing the drought in some regions, but the drought remains severe in most areas. The drought has been relieved in Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang provinces and regions. The drought has been basically relieved in most areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou provinces, and in more than half of the drought-stricken areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. In Shandong and Henan provinces, which are severely affected by drought, the drought has been somewhat alleviated or relieved in small areas. Anhui, Hubei, and Shanxi received light rain in some areas, while Jiangsu has not had any rain. The drought situation is still developing in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The areas that have received rainfall are actively carrying out water storage, water conservation, drought relief irrigation, and emergency planting. Areas that have not received rainfall are further strengthening the fight against drought.

Since July, the cumulative drought-affected area in the seventeen provinces and regions has reached over 320 million mu. Through drought relief efforts and rainfall in many areas, as of the 20th, drought has been relieved on over 150 million mu, while over 170 million mu still need continued drought relief due to insufficient rainfall or no rainfall.

Starting in mid-August, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other provinces and regions generally received rainfall, with rainfall amounts around 50 millimeters, with some areas receiving over 100 millimeters, and others receiving 20 to 30 millimeters. After the rain, the drought in these provinces and regions was completely or largely relieved. Shandong Province, which has a large drought-affected area, received rainfall from the 13th to the 14th. In some areas of Wudi, Zhanhua, Pingyuan, Dezhou, and Changyi, Changle, and other ten counties and cities, rainfall exceeded 50 millimeters, and the drought was basically relieved on about 10 million mu of drought-affected farmland. Thirty-four counties and cities, including Linyi and Boxing, received rainfall of more than 30 millimeters, and the drought situation on about 20 million mu of drought-affected farmland was temporarily eased, but the drought has not been relieved. At present, Shandong Province still has more than 40 million mu of farmland that needs drought relief. From the 12th to the 15th, more than 90 counties in Henan Province received rainfall, generally ranging from 10 to 30 millimeters, with the rainfall center between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. The rain relieved the drought on 3 million mu of drought-affected farmland. At present, the total drought-affected area in the province is still around 30 million mu. In addition, Anhui and Hubei provinces, as well as eastern and southeastern Shanxi, also received 10 to 20 millimeters of rain in mid-August. Due to the small amount of rainfall, the drought has not been relieved. Anhui Province has had no rain in recent days, and the drought situation has worsened. Jiangsu Province has had no rain, and the drought is still very serious. People in the areas along the Yangtze River are taking advantage of the recent rise in water levels during the high tide season to urgently divert and store tidal water to enhance their long-term drought resistance capabilities.

The areas that have received rainfall are actively carrying out water storage, water conservation, irrigation, and emergency planting activities. In Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, the fight against drought intensified after the rain, with the drought relief workforce increasing from the original 2.2 million to 2.63 million, and the daily progress of irrigation increasing by 70,000 mu compared to before the rain (irrigating 680,000 mu per day). Hunan Province seized the opportunity of rainfall to vigorously build dams across rivers and carry out water storage and conservation work. Currently, more than 3,000 reservoirs in the province are full or half-full, and about 400,000 mountain ponds are also full or half-full. After the rain, Changde County mobilized 65,000 people to block 90,000 places to store water, and also built 6,800 temporary dams, reinforced and raised more than 90,000 field ridges, and opened more than 5,000 water diversion ditches. After the rain, Sichuan Province sent special personnel to lead water storage and conservation work in various prefectures. To date, the province has diverted water to fill 250,000 ponds and irrigated 200,000 mu of farmland. On the 13th, Fuling County rushed to plant 240,000 mu of late autumn crops in one day, and Wanxian Prefecture also rushed to plant 500,000 mu of late autumn crops on the same day. Currently, the province has increased planting, replanting, and changed planting of various late autumn crops by more than 20 million mu. After the rain, Guizhou Province deployed drought relief and water storage work. The Secretary of the Hezhang County Party Committee led cadres and the masses to store water in the rain, and all 14 reservoirs and more than 600 ponds in the county were filled with water.

　　全国部分受旱地区喜雨
    一亿五千万亩旱象解除　一亿七千万亩还要抗旱
    新华社21日讯　我国发生旱象的十七个省区，8月以来不少地区下了雨，部分地区旱象已经解除或缓和，但大部地区的干旱仍然严重。广东、广西、浙江、福建、云南和黑龙江等省区旱象已解除，湖南、江西、贵州三省大部地区和四川、陕西两省一半以上受旱地区的旱象已基本解除。受旱严重的山东、河南两省，小部分地区旱象有所缓和或解除。安徽、湖北和山西部分地区降了小雨，江苏一直没有下雨。现在江苏、安徽二省旱象还在发展。上述已降雨地区，雨后都积极地开展了蓄水、保水、抗旱浇地、抢种等工作。没有降雨地区，正在进一步加强抗旱斗争。
    从7月以来，受旱的十七个省区，累计的受旱面积达到三亿二千多万亩，经过抗旱抢救和不少地区下雨，到20日止，已有一亿五千多万亩解除旱象，还有一亿七千多万亩因雨量较小或未下雨，需要继续抗旱。
    从8月中旬开始，江西、湖南、广东、广西、云南等省区普遍降雨，降雨量在五十毫米左右，多的达一百毫米以上，少的也有二十毫米到三十毫米。雨后，这几个省区的旱象全部或大部解除。受旱面积较大的山东省13日到14日降雨，无棣、沾化、平原、德州市和昌邑、昌乐等十个县市的部分地区降雨在五十毫米以上，约有一千万亩受旱农田的旱象基本解除；临沂、博兴等三十四个县市降雨三十毫米以上，约有二千万亩受旱农田旱情暂时得到缓和，但旱象并未解除。到目前，山东全省仍有四千多万亩农田需要抗旱抢救。河南省12日到15日全省有九十多个县降雨，雨量一般在十毫米到三十毫米，降雨中心在郑州、开封之间。这次下雨，有三百万亩受旱农田解除旱象。目前全省受旱总面积仍在三千万亩左右。此外，安徽、湖北两省和山西的东部、东南部在8月中旬也都下了十到二十毫米雨，由于雨量小，旱象没有解除，安徽省近日来无雨，旱象又有发展。江苏省一直无雨，干旱仍很严重，沿江地区人民正在乘最近几天长江大潮汛水位增长的时机，紧急行动抢引潮水和拦蓄潮水，增强长期抗旱的能力。
    已降雨的地区，雨后都积极开展了蓄水保水和浇地、抢种等活动。山东省聊城专区在雨后抗旱斗争深入了一步，抗旱劳动力由原来的二百二十万人增加到二百六十三万人，浇地日进度比雨前增快七万亩（每天浇地六十八万亩）。湖南省抓住降雨时机，大搞拦河筑坝，蓄水保水工作。现在全省有三千多座水库蓄满或半蓄满了水，有四十万口左右的山塘也蓄满或半蓄满了水。常德县雨后出动六万五千人，堵口蓄水九万多处，还打临时坝六千八百处，加固加高田埂九万多条，开引水沟五千多条。四川省各专区在雨后派专人领导蓄水保水工作，到目前，全省已引水灌满二十五万口塘，还灌田二十万亩。涪陵县在13日一天抢种晚秋二十四万亩，万县专区在同一天也抢种晚秋五十万亩，现在全省共增种、补种、改种各种晚秋作物二千多万亩。贵州省雨后部署了抗旱和蓄水等工作，赫章县由县委书记带领干部群众冒雨蓄水，全县十四个水库、六百多口塘都蓄满了水。
