　　蒙古各地制定文化进军措施
　　乌兰巴托市民决心用实际行动起带头作用
    新华社乌兰巴托17日电　蒙古首都和各省的党政机关最近先后召开会议，讨论蒙古人民革命党中央政治局关于开展全国文化进军的决议。这个决议是为迎接蒙古人民革命胜利四十周年（1961年7月11日）而作出的，决议要求人人讲卫生、提高文化水平、遵守公共守则、进一步提高人民群众的社会主义觉悟和劳动积极性。
    根据这个决议的精神，乌兰巴托市已经制定了向文化进军的规划，要求市民们美化市容、提高文化、改进公共卫生。这个规划将由全市劳动人民广泛讨论，并加以补充和修改。现在首都各工厂企业、文化教育部门都正在讨论和制定本部门的具体规划。例如，蒙古工业联合工厂计划在最近几年内使全厂工人达到中学的文化水平。首都人民表示要以实际的模范行动带动各地人民向文化进军。
    各省劳动人民也在讨论和制定规划。南戈壁省决定，在今年第三季度进行全省性的文化大检查，派宣传队到各县的农牧业合作社开展宣传，并进行文化学习的辅导工作。这个省还决定在农牧业合作社中普遍建立浴室和阅览室等，为改进卫生情况和文化学习创造条件。
    东戈壁省规划的重点是消除人们生活中的落后残余，普遍提高人们的文化知识。肯特省决定最近举办“科学和教育双周”活动，向群众宣传科学和卫生常识。乔巴山省的许多县都成立了专门委员会，负责领导人民向文化进军。有些县为增进人民体质，决定修建运动场，提倡体育活动；许多合作社决定修建俱乐部、学生宿舍等。
