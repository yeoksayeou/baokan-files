The fight against drought, flood control, drainage of waterlogged areas, and pest extermination are the current urgent combat missions on the agricultural front. Since the summer of this year, the climate in many regions has been very abnormal, with more droughts, floods, and insect plagues than in previous years. First, there was the major flood in Guangdong Province in June; then, parts of Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions suffered from floods due to concentrated heavy rainfall; more seriously, vast areas of central China, including Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other provinces, have experienced prolonged periods without rain, resulting in severe drought and, in many areas, insect plagues. Faced with such severe water, drought, and insect disasters, all localities have carried out tenacious disaster relief efforts and have already achieved significant results. Drought-resistant irrigation has rescued approximately 100 million mu of crops. Many reservoirs built since the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have played a role in intercepting and storing floodwaters and reducing the threat of flooding downstream. In the struggle against disasters, many localities have once again implemented large-scale cooperation, "large-scale operations," demonstrating the superiority of the people's communes. Now, the rainy season has not yet passed, and floods may continue to occur in various places. According to meteorological forecasts, rainfall in the central provinces in August and September may be less than in previous years, and the threat of drought and insect plagues in these areas may continue to expand. At the same time, it should be noted that areas currently affected by drought may subsequently experience localized heavy rainfall, leading to floods. Therefore, all localities must fully mobilize the masses and carry the fight against disasters, flood prevention, and pest extermination to the end, treating this struggle as the most urgent task at present.

In order to overcome water, drought, and insect disasters and strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn, it is first necessary to resolutely oppose right-leaning thoughts and pessimistic, lax sentiments, boost morale, and mobilize millions of farmers ideologically and spiritually. With the belief that "man can conquer nature," they must do everything possible and make full use of all possibilities to wage a persistent battle against water, drought, and insect disasters with earth-shattering spirit. Any right-leaning conservative ideas and pessimistic, lax sentiments must be resolutely overcome; otherwise, it will be impossible to inspire the soaring enthusiasm of the masses to overcome the current water, drought, and insect disasters. It is necessary to continue to promote the style of the mass line and continue to implement the organizational leadership methods that have proven effective in the Great Leap Forward, mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and launching a vigorous disaster relief battle. At the same time, it is necessary to promote the spirit of mutual assistance in times of difficulty, implement necessary large-scale cooperation based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and leverage the strength of large collectives to overcome natural disasters. The masses deeply understand that relying solely on small collectives and individual operations is powerless in the face of severe natural disasters; only mutual assistance and mutually beneficial large-scale cooperation can overcome the current natural disasters. The people's communes should further fully demonstrate their superiority in the fight against disasters.

The commercial, agricultural, and flood control departments must do everything possible to earnestly and responsibly handle the allocation and supply of drainage and irrigation machinery, gasoline, coal, pesticides, and various flood control and pest extermination equipment needed for the disaster relief effort. In order to save disaster-stricken crops, commercial and chemical industry departments must make every effort to increase production and supply. For areas where crops have died due to drought or been submerged by water and need to be replanted, agricultural, grain, and commercial departments should arrange for the supply of seeds needed for replanting as soon as possible.

In disaster-stricken areas, plans for how to ensure the daily life of all victims should be earnestly arranged, vigorously promoting thrift and encouraging the mixing of grain and melons/vegetables to save grain; a large number of late-maturing crops and various plantable melons, vegetables, red radishes, and other crops should be hastily planted to prepare for hard times. Past experience has proven that as long as there is adequate preparation and the masses are mobilized and organized to carry out a tenacious struggle, any famine can be overcome. The civil affairs departments should do a good job in disaster relief work. The issuance of agricultural loans should also give more consideration to disaster areas. Gasoline, fertilizers, pesticides, and other materials used for disaster relief can also be sold on credit, depending on the situation, by the province (municipality, autonomous region).

Non-disaster areas should also promote grain conservation and make great efforts to increase grain production in order to support disaster areas.

The disaster situation this year is more severe than in previous years. The entire party and all the people must boost their morale and make the greatest efforts to overcome disasters, strive for a bumper autumn harvest, and strive for the continued leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, for areas with particularly severe local disasters, with the support of the state and prosperous areas, it is essential to do everything possible to adhere to self-reliance, hard work, and overcome disasters, to complete the great and glorious task of continuing to develop production and ensuring the people's livelihood under difficult conditions.

    中共中央国务院
    关于展开抗灾斗争的紧急指示
    一九五九年八月十三日
    抗旱、防洪、防涝、灭虫是农业战线上当前紧急的战斗任务。今年夏季以来，不少地区气候很不正常，旱涝虫灾比往年多。先是广东省六月间发生的大洪水；接着是河北、辽宁、吉林、内蒙古等省区的部分地区先后因暴雨集中，洪涝成灾；更严重的是我国中部地区河南、山东、安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏、江西等省的大片地区，在一个长时期内无雨，发生了严重的旱灾，并且在不少地区发生了虫灾。面临着这样严重的水旱虫灾，各个地方都进行了顽强的抗灾斗争，并且已经取得了显著的成绩。抗旱灌溉已经抢救了农作物约一亿亩。一九五八年大跃进以来兴修的许多水库已经发挥了拦洪蓄洪、减轻下游洪水威胁的作用。在抗灾斗争中，许多地方又实行了大协作，“大兵团作战”，再一次显示了人民公社的优越性。现在，雨季并未过去，洪涝灾害还会在各地陆续发生。据气象预报，中部地区各省八、九两个月的降雨量可能少于往年，这些地区的旱灾、虫灾威胁还有继续扩大之势。同时，还要注意到，现在受旱的地区，也有可能随后发生局部的集中暴雨，带来洪涝灾害。因此，各地必须充分发动群众，把抗灾、防灾、灭虫斗争进行到底，把这个斗争作为当前最紧急的任务。
    为了战胜水旱虫灾，争取秋季丰收，首先必须坚决反对右倾思想和悲观、松劲情绪，鼓足干劲，从思想上、精神上把千百万农民动员起来，抱着“人定胜天”的信念，千方百计，充分利用一切可能，以翻江倒海的气概，同水旱虫灾进行坚持不懈的战斗。任何右倾保守思想和悲观、松劲情绪，都必须坚决克服，否则就不能鼓起广大群众的冲天干劲，来战胜当前的水旱虫灾。要继续发扬群众路线的作风，继续实行在大跃进中已经证明是行之有效的组织领导的方法，动员群众，组织群众，展开一个轰轰烈烈的抗灾战斗。同时，要发扬患难相扶的精神，在互助互利的原则下，实行必要的大协作，发挥大集体的力量，战胜自然灾害。群众深深懂得：只靠小集体、单独作战，在严重的自然灾害面前是无能为力的；只有互助互利的大协作，才有可能战胜当前的自然灾害。人民公社应该在抗灾斗争中进一步充分发挥它的优越性。
    抗灾斗争所需要的排灌机械、汽油、燃煤、农药和各种防汛、灭虫器材的调拨供应工作，商业、农业和防汛指挥部门必须竭尽一切可能切实负责作好。为了抢救受灾的农作物，商业部门和化学工业部门必须尽力设法增加生产和供应。遭旱枯死和被水淹没需要改种的，农业部门和粮食、商业部门应该及早安排好改种所需要的种子供应。
    在遭受灾害的地区，应该切实把全部灾民如何过日子的计划安排好，大力提倡节约，大力提倡粮食和瓜菜混吃，节约粮食；要大量抢种一季晚熟作物和各种尚能种植的瓜菜红萝卜等作物，准备渡荒。历年来的经验证明，只要有了充分的准备，只要动员群众组织起来进行顽强的斗争，任何灾荒都是可以渡过的。民政部门应该作好救灾工作。农贷的发放也应该多照顾灾区。抗灾所用的汽油、化肥、农药等等物资，也可以根据情况，由省（市、自治区）决定，实行赊销。
    非灾区也应该提倡节约粮食，并且要用极大努力增产粮食，以便支援灾区。
    今年的灾情比往年重。全党全民必须鼓足干劲，用最大的努力战胜灾害，争取秋季丰收，争取农业生产继续跃进。同时，对于局部的灾情特别重的地区，在国家和丰收地区的支援下，一定要千方百计地坚持自力更生，坚苦奋斗，战胜灾荒，在困难条件下完成继续发展生产和保障人民生活的伟大的光荣任务。
