Xinhua News Agency Report: Guangxi is actively storing and conserving water in various water conservancy facilities to ensure an even greater bumper harvest of autumn grain crops.

According to meteorological forecasts, rainfall in Guangxi will decrease in August and September. Currently, the transplanting of over 11 million mu of late rice has just finished, and 7.7 million mu of intermediate rice is in the heading stage, both requiring a large amount of water. However, the region's water storage is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, under the slogan of "Resolutely fight drought if there is drought, actively prevent drought if there is no drought," all localities are taking active action and joining the battle of storing and conserving water and preventing drought.

　　广西积极蓄水保水防害
    据新华社讯　广西各地水利工程设施积极蓄水防旱，保证秋粮作物更大丰收。
    根据气象预报，广西8、9月份雨量将会减少。目前，一千一百多万亩晚稻插秧刚结束，七百七十万亩中稻正在孕穗，都需要大量用水，而全区的蓄水量离满足需要还很远。因此，各地都在“有旱坚决抗，无旱积极防”的口号下，积极行动起来，投入蓄水保水防旱的战斗。
