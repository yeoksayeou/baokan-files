    Striving for a bumper harvest of cash crops such as cotton, oilseeds, tobacco, sugarcane, sugar beets, and jute is an important part of this year's overall bumper harvest on the agricultural front. The increase in cash crop production mainly depends on two aspects: one is expanding the planting area, and the other is strengthening field management to increase yield per unit area. Now that most cash crops have been planted, the main way to increase production is to mobilize the masses, muster their energy, and use the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work to engage in field management to ensure high yields and bumper harvests. According to past habits, some crops that do not grow well after planting are abandoned and replanted with other crops. This situation should be prevented as much as possible. In places where crops are not growing well, active measures should be taken to strengthen field management and reverse the unfavorable situation, transforming third-class seedlings into first-class seedlings. It must be recognized that even if only a small piece of land is abandoned for cash crops, these many small pieces of land add up to an alarmingly large area nationwide. If left to develop on its own, it will directly affect the completion of total output.
    August is the peak growing season for various cash crops. According to investigations by Sichuan scientific research departments: if sufficient fertilizer and water can be ensured for sugarcane in July and August, and there are no pests or diseases, it can grow three to five centimeters per day; otherwise, it can only grow one to two centimeters or even less. Cotton also relies on the formation of more early and late bolls to increase yield. The same is true for other cash crops. Therefore, strengthening field management during this period, increasing production by 20% to 30% on the original basis is entirely achievable. August is also a period with relatively many natural disasters, with floods, droughts, insect pests, and diseases occurring one after another. If field management work does not keep up, various disasters will expand, and many cash crops, after suffering from natural disasters, will not only fail to increase production, but also face the risk of reduced production or even crop failure. For example, if there is too much rain and the temperature is too high, tobacco leaves will develop black shank disease. According to past experience, tobacco leaf production will be reduced by 20% to 30% after black shank disease occurs. If sugar beets contract beet yellows virus, the sugar content will decrease by 11% to 33% in severe cases. Therefore, the key to striving for a bumper harvest of cash crops at present is to seize the opportunity to strengthen field management and overcome various disasters, so as to provide favorable conditions for ensuring a bumper harvest.
    Generally speaking, field management of cash crops is much more complicated than that of food crops. The color and aroma of tobacco leaves are not only determined by curing, but also, first and foremost, by cultivation. Nitrogen fertilizer can increase tobacco leaf yield, but if too much is applied, it will increase the amount of protein and nicotine in the leaves, resulting in a pungent taste and reduced quality, and the leaves will grow too thick, affecting the quality of curing; phosphorus fertilizer can lighten the leaf color, accelerate maturity, and promote good root development, especially it can inhibit and eliminate the adverse effects caused by excessive nitrogen fertilizer and improve the quality of tobacco leaves; however, excessive application will cause premature aging of the leaves. The earthing-up work of sugarcane looks very simple, but it is not. In the early stage, in order to promote tillering, the earthing-up should not be too deep; in the later stage, in order to inhibit tillering, the earthing-up should not be too shallow. Many cash crops are particularly afraid of drought and waterlogging. Sugar beets are a case in point. Drought will cause root rot, and waterlogging will also cause root rot. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent both drought and waterlogging. At present, the southern region is experiencing drought, so cash crops should be watered as much as possible to meet their water requirements. At the same time, attention should be paid to ditching and earthing-up to prevent attacks from storms.
    It is a fact that cash crops are technically demanding and require a lot of input, but some people have come to the conclusion that it is better to grow food crops than cash crops. This view is not comprehensive. While food is indeed an indispensable and important material for national construction and people's lives, which cash crop can be dispensed with? They not only provide the necessary raw materials for light industry, but also supply a large number of daily necessities and non-staple foods for urban and rural residents. Comprehensively considering and developing various productions in a balanced way is required for the planned and proportional development of the national economy. Only when various productions can develop in a balanced way can socialist construction be carried out quickly and well. Therefore, the production of cash crops must not be neglected in the slightest. Especially some concentrated production areas, such as Henan, a concentrated flue-cured tobacco production area, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan, concentrated sugarcane production areas, and Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, concentrated sugar beet production areas. The planting area of ​​cash crops in these areas accounts for a large proportion of the national planting area. The poor yield of cash crops in these areas has a decisive impact on the national yield. Therefore, while doing a good job in food production, these areas must also complete the task of growing cash crops as an important political and economic task. Although these crops require more input, the income of most crops is also relatively high. According to surveys in some key flue-cured tobacco counties, tobacco field area generally only accounts for about 10% of the cultivated land area, but its income accounts for about 40% of the total agricultural income. Therefore, even from an economic point of view, it should not be ignored. If the areas where cash crops are concentrated should seize the bumper harvest, can the areas where cash crops are scattered not work hard to increase production? Absolutely not. Because the proportion of a certain cash crop in the production of a certain region may be very small, and the proportion in the whole country may be even smaller, as small as 1% or 0.5%, but no matter how small the number is, it is still an indispensable part of the national total agricultural production plan. Without this part, the national plan cannot be completed 100%. In this way, it will have a certain impact on national construction and people's lives; and reducing a part of income is also unfavorable to communes and members. Neijiang County, Sichuan, reasonably arranged labor according to the principle of "guaranteeing key points (rice) and seizing characteristics (sugarcane)", and as a result, both rice and sugarcane production were carried out very well. This approach is worth promoting.
    In recent years, food production has been greatly improved, but the production of cash crops has not been improved quickly. It is understood that in 1953, the national average yield of sugar beets was more than 1,300 jin per mu. By last year, it had only increased by more than 100 jin. Sugarcane production reached more than 5,200 jin in 1952, but it only reached more than 5,600 jin last year. Compared with the growth rate of food, it is relatively small. Is it impossible to increase the production of these crops quickly? Of course not. The vast majority of cash crops are high-yield crops. As long as they are processed and managed, it is entirely possible to strive for a big harvest. Some counties had an average sugarcane yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu last year due to good management, which is more than double the national average yield of 5,647 jin. This is a good example.
    Completing this year's cash crop planting plan has certain difficulties, but more importantly, there are also many favorable conditions this year. After further rectification and consolidation, the people's communes have closer relations between cadres and the masses, cadres' work styles are more in-depth, and the masses' enthusiasm for production is higher; after the exercise of the Great Leap Forward, experience is richer, and production organizations are more sound. Therefore, as long as we mobilize the masses, make everyone fully aware of the importance of striving for a bumper harvest of cash crops and its direct relationship with national construction and commune members' lives, and at the same time, rely on the masses to do everything possible to strengthen field management, we will definitely be able to achieve a bumper harvest of cash crops.

### 奋战八月份，力争经济作物大丰收

    奋战八月份，力争经济作物大丰收
    争取棉花、油料、烟叶、甘蔗、甜菜、黄麻等经济作物大丰收是今年农业战线全面大丰收的重要组成部分。经济作物的增产主要决定于两个方面：一是扩大种植面积，一是加强田间管理，提高单位面积产量。现在绝大部分经济作物已经种植完毕，提高产量的主要途径就是动员群众、鼓足干劲、用苦干实干巧干的精神大搞田间管理，保证丰产丰收。按照过去的习惯，种植以后，长得不好的作物，总有一些被废弃，改种其他作物。这种情况应当极力防止发生。凡是作物生长情况不好的地方，应该积极设法，采取紧急措施，加强田间管理，扭转不利局面，变三类苗为一类苗。必须认识到，那怕废弃的只是一小块土地经济作物，但是，从全国范围来看，这许多小块土地加在一起就变成了为数惊人的大面积。如果任其自流发展，它将会直接影响总产量的完成。
    8月，正是各项经济作物生长旺盛时期。据四川科学研究部门调查：在7、8两个月中，如果能够保证甘蔗肥足水饱，无病虫危害，每天就可以长三至五公分，反之，就只能长一公分到二公分甚至更少。棉花也是靠多结伏桃、秋桃来增加产量的。其他经济作物也是如此。因此，加强了这个期间的田间管理，在原有基础上增产二三成是完全有把握的。8月也是自然灾害比较多的时期，水灾、旱灾、虫灾、病灾，接连发生。田间管理工作跟不上去，各种灾害就要扩大，许多经济作物在遭受自然灾害以后，不仅不能增产，还有减产以至失收的危险。比如雨水过多，气温过高，烟叶就会发生黑茎病。烟叶发生黑茎病以后，根据历年的经验，就要减产20％到30％。甜菜得了毒素病，严重时，含糖率就会降低11％到33％。因此，目前争取经济作物丰收的关键就是必须抓紧时机加强田间管理、战胜各种灾害，为确保丰产丰收提供有利条件。
    经济作物的田间管理，一般说比粮食作物复杂得多。烟叶的色香，不仅决定于烘烤，而且，首先决定于栽培。氮肥可以增加烟叶产量，但是施得过多，就会使叶内的蛋白质、烟硷量增加，烟味辛辣，品质下降，而且叶子长得过厚，影响烘烤的质量；磷肥能够使叶色变淡、成熟加快和促使根系发育良好，特别是可以抑制和消除氮肥过多所引起的不良影响，提高烟叶品质；但是施用过多，又会引起叶片过早衰老。甘蔗的培土工作看起来很简单，其实不然，前期为了促进分蘖，培土就不能过深；后期为了抑制分蘖，培土就不能过浅。许多经济作物，又特别怕旱怕涝。甜菜就是一例。旱了要发生根腐病，涝了也要发生根腐病。因此，既要防旱又要防涝。目前南方地区干旱，当然要给经济作物多多浇水，以满足经济作物对水分的要求。同时要注意开沟培土，防备暴风雨的袭击。
    经济作物技术性强、工本又大，这是事实，可是有人却由此产生一种说法，认为，种经济作物不如种粮食。这种看法是不全面的。粮食固然是国家建设和人民生活中不可缺少的重要物资，而经济作物哪一样又是可以缺少的呢？它们不仅为轻工业提供了必要的原料，也供应了城乡人民大量的日用品和副食品。统筹兼顾，综合平衡地发展各项生产，是国民经济有计划按比例发展所要求的，只有各项生产能够均衡发展，社会主义建设才能有条件又快又好地进行。因此，对经济作物的生产绝不能丝毫有所忽视。特别是一些集中产区，烤烟集中产地河南、甘蔗集中产地广东、广西、四川、甜菜集中产地黑龙江、内蒙古。这些地区的经济作物种植面积，在全国种植面积中占的比重都很大。这些地区的经济作物产量不好，对全国产量有着决定性的影响。因而这些地区在搞好粮食生产的同时，也必须把种好经济作物作为一项重要政治的经济的任务来完成。这些作物虽然要多花些工本，但是大多数作物的收益也是比较高的。据一些重点烤烟县的调查，烟田面积一般只占耕地面积10％左右，而其收入却占农业总收入的40％左右。因此，即使从经济观点出发，也不应忽视。经济作物集中的地区要抓紧丰产，是不是经济作物分散的地区就可以不必努力提高产量了呢？完全不是。因为，某一项经济作物在某个地区生产中占的比例可能很小，在全国占的比例可能更小，小到1％或者0.5％，但是不管数字如何小，仍是全国总的农业生产计划的缺一不可的组成部分，没有这一部分，就不能百分之百的完成国家计划。这样，对国家建设，对人民生活要发生一定的影响；而且减少了一部分收入对公社和社员也不利。四川内江县根据“保证重点（水稻）抓紧特点（甘蔗）”的原则，合理安排了劳力，结果水稻甘蔗两项生产都搞得很好。这种做法很值得提倡。
    几年来，粮食产量已有很大提高，而经济作物产量却提高得不快。据了解，1953年，全国甜菜产量平均每亩一千三百多斤，到去年为止，只增加了一百多斤，甘蔗产量1952年就到五千二百多斤，而去年也才只达到五千六百多斤。同粮食的增长幅度比较，是比较小的。是不是这些作物的产量不可能很快提高呢？当然不是。绝大多数经济作物是高产作物，只要加工管理，争取大的丰收完全可能。有些县由于管理得好，去年平均亩产甘蔗一万多斤，相当于全国平均产量五千六百四十七斤的一倍多。这就是一个很好的例子。
    完成今年经济作物种植计划是有一定的困难的，但是更重要的，今年也有很多有利条件，人民公社经过进一步整顿巩固，干部和群众的关系更加密切，干部作风更加深入，群众生产积极性更加高涨；经过大跃进的锻炼，经验更加丰富，生产组织更加健全。因此，只要我们把群众动员起来，使大家充分认识争取经济作物丰收的重要意义以及同国家建设和社员生活的直接关系，同时，依靠群众尽一切努力加强田间管理，我们就一定可以取得经济作物的大丰收。
