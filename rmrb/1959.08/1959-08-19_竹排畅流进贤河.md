　　Bamboo Rafts Flow Smoothly Through the Xian River
　　By our reporter Zhou Rong
　　One day in early autumn, I and Qing Xijin, the Party Secretary of the He Xianguan Commune in Lingling, Hunan, walked along the rugged mountain road to the bank of the Xian River.
　　The river water reflected the golden sunlight, sparkling dazzlingly. In the valley where towering bamboo forests grew on both sides of the river, the work songs of the bamboo rafting workers echoed on the river. Approaching from afar, from small to large. One after another, the bamboo rafts flowed down with the current from the bend ahead. Gao Mingshi, wearing a straw hat and with his strong hands gripping the bamboo pole, stood upright on the first raft. He observed the waterway so familiarly. At a glance, you could tell he was a skilled rafter. Under his control, the bamboo raft, like a tamed wild horse, obediently followed the waterway in the center of the river and flew straight down. Behind him were Chen Huanquan and his companions, driving one raft after another, keeping up, their movements so effortless. Rushing, chasing, the splashing water and the sound of their work songs startled the valley. In an instant, the bamboo rafts left people's sight and turned into the bend two miles downstream.
　　This moving scene made people recall the history of the Xian River. Secretary Qing told me that the Xian River originates in Guangxi, bordering Hunan. In this section, because the river is still between two mountains, it has ten bends and nine curves, with more than a hundred hidden reefs and dangerous shoals. "Coffin Pond", "Tiger Throat", and "Immortal Drill" are among the most dangerous shoals and are the biggest obstacles to floating bamboo rafts. The people of the He Xianguan Commune successively cultivated more than 190,000 mu of Phoebe nanmu and fir forests along the banks of the downstream river. They grow tall and dense. When it is time to cut them down each year, the mountains are high and the roads are steep, making it inconvenient to transport them by manpower. They have to take advantage of the rainy season in spring, summer, and autumn to tie the Phoebe nanmu into rafts and select strong, familiar rafters to risk floating them down the river to the Xiang River. When passing through dangerous shoals, some bamboo rafts are scattered and lost. Despite trying every means, only more than 100,000 Phoebe nanmu logs can be transported out of this small river each year, which is far from meeting the needs. For many years, people have hoped to transform it, blasting away hidden reefs and deepening the shoals to make it flow smoothly.
　　The moment to realize this beautiful wish finally arrived. Last autumn, more than 1,600 households along the downstream river built the He Xianguan Commune. Fine hemp was twisted into a single rope, and the strength was greater. After the commune members discussed it, they decided to comprehensively repair and dredge the river in winter, break the reefs and transform the shoals, and turn this section of the river into an unobstructed flow, so as to transport more and more Phoebe nanmu out to support the construction of the motherland. What a glorious and arduous task this is! The next day, Qing Xijin, the Party Secretary of the commune, led several "local" surveying technicians to set off for surveying. Old Qing felt so close when he came to the riverbank. It turned out that his home was in this mountain valley. The riverbank was where he herded cattle as a child. He would herd cattle here today and there tomorrow. He had seen and remembered all the dangerous shoals and hidden reefs in the river. During this segment-by-segment exploration along the river, he was so familiar whenever he came to a dangerous shoal or hidden reef. But he still observed carefully, sometimes measuring with a ruler, sometimes wading into the water to personally test, and then drawing maps on the spot, recording in detail, and determining governance measures.
　　One day in late October, the battle to repair and dredge the Xian River began. The river repair team, composed of two hundred migrant workers and stonemasons, rushed to the front line under the leadership of Secretary Qing. According to the river management plan, in addition to blasting away hidden reefs and deepening the transformation of dangerous shoals, they also had to cut through a small mountain. At the same time, in order to be able to float bamboo rafts even when the water is shallow in winter, five large stone dams were to be built along the river to store water and open the gates to send rafts. The biggest and most difficult of these projects was to cut through the Hanmu'ao small mountain. It is fifty meters high and seventy meters thick, composed of rubble, making the river detour for more than seven miles and forming a dangerous shoal. Now it is not easy to split it open, straighten the river, and let the water flow straight. Communist Party member Xie Heyun was the first to stand up and asked the Party to approve him to go. Then, the migrant workers stood up one after another. A total of one hundred people unanimously elected Old Xie as the site director. When they arrived at Hanmu'ao Mountain, the migrant workers immediately picked up their machetes to cut down the bushes and forests on the mountain, and picked up their hoes to dig hard; the stonemasons picked up iron hammers and steel chisels to chisel stones and blast the mountain with cannons. At first, one cannon blasted hundreds of cubic meters of rubble. Old Xie was not satisfied, so he and the stonemasons chiseled a large stone cave and blasted seven thousand cubic meters of rubble and earth with one cannon. This creation made the project a success and advanced rapidly. At this time, all the other projects also started. From morning till night, the downstream of the Xian River was immersed in a boiling sound: the labor chants of the people, the digging of the hoes, and the sound of blasting stones, all combined to drown out the sound of the water. The migrant workers learned from the heroic spirit of the Red Army during the Long March, eating on the riverbank, sleeping on the riverbank, and fighting on the riverbank. Chen Rongxuan and his thirty colleagues were building a stone dam in Luopujian, with no houses within dozens of miles around, a den of tigers and wolves. They used tree branches to build a high shed to protect against animals, wind, and rain, and persisted in repairing it. In winter, the north wind howled, and the river water was so cold that it stung the bones. The stonemasons, led by their captain, Communist Party member Xia Yuyuan, lit piles of fires on the riverbank. They would bake for a while and then go into the water to strike stones, strike stones for a while and then come up to bake by the fire. The severe cold bowed down in front of them. Winter passed and spring came, everyone's enthusiasm was even greater, and the progress of the project was even faster. Stone dams were built one after another; hidden reefs were blasted away one by one, and shallow beaches were deepened and transformed one after another; four-fifths of Hanmu'ao had also been dug away. By March, except for the very small part of Hanmu'ao Mountain that remained to be further excavated, all the remaining projects were completed as desired, and the Xian River was completely renewed.
　　The spring peach blossom flood season quickly arrived, and the water volume of the Xian River rose sharply. The people on both sides of the river were unspeakably happy. The commune Party committee quickly organized a logging team of several hundred people to go up the mountain to fell Phoebe nanmu, and also erected chutes from the top of the mountain and dug chutes to flow the Phoebe nanmu from the top of the mountain straight to the river bank. One hundred people cutting, only three to five people need to float. It improves work efficiency nearly a hundred times compared to carrying it down the mountain. The bamboo on the riverbank was immediately tied into rafts and went straight down with the water. The first batch of bamboo rafts was floated by the transportation workers of the Weilin Farm in He Xianguan Commune. When they drove the rafts through the original dangerous shoals such as "Coffin Pond", "Tiger Throat", and "Immortal Drill", the water was as calm as the water of the Xiang River, and they were no longer so uneasy. The floating time was also reduced by one-third compared to the past.
　　When we came here to visit, we happened to encounter a drought. Although it had not rained for more than fifty days, people made full use of the water stored by the stone dams to float rafts. The bamboo rafts were still rushing on the Xian River. In the past six months, they have already floated more than 1.3 million Phoebe nanmu logs, equivalent to the transport volume of the past five years. These Phoebe nanmu logs have played their role on various construction sites in the motherland. (Attached picture)

　　竹排畅流进贤河
　　本报记者　周荣
    初秋的一天，我和湖南零陵何仙观公社党委书记卿锡晋，踏着崎岖的山路，来到了进贤河畔。
    河水映着金灿灿的阳光，闪烁耀眼，两岸竹林参天的山谷里，回旋着河上放运竹排工人的号子声。由远而近，由小而大。一扎连一扎的竹排，从前面转弯的地方随水流了下来。高明仕头戴草帽，劲鼓鼓的双手握着竹篙，直挺挺地站在第一扎竹排上，是那样熟悉地观察着水路，一看，就知道他是个放排的能手，竹排在他的驾驭下，像驯服了的野马，顺从河心的水路，飞也似的直流了下去。后边是陈焕泉和他的伙伴们，驾着一扎又一扎的竹排追赶了上来，动作都是那么应付自如。赶呀，追呀，水花飞溅，流水声和号子声惊荡着山谷。转瞬间，竹排就离开了人们的视线，转进了两里路的下游拐弯处。
    这动人的景象，使人们回想起进贤河的身世来，卿书记告诉我，进贤河发源在与湖南毗邻的广西境内。在这一段里，由于河仍处两山之间，十湾九曲，暗礁和滩险有百余处。“棺材氹”，“老虎喉”、“神仙钻”是其中最危险的滩险，是流放竹排最大的障碍。何仙观公社的人们，相继在沿河下游两岸栽培了十九万多亩楠竹和杉林，长得高大茂密。每年轮番砍伐时，山高路陡，人力不便运出。只得利用春夏秋三季下雨涨水时刻，把楠竹扎成一扎的竹排，选择身强体壮熟悉水路的人来驾排，冒着危险从河上流放入湘江。过滩险时，有些竹排被冲散流失了。想方设法，从这条小河上每年只能运出十多万根楠竹，远远不能满足需要。多少年来，人们就希望改造它，炸掉暗礁，加深滩地，使它畅流无阻。
    实现这美好的愿望的时刻终于来到了。去年秋天，这里沿河下游两岸一千六百多户人家建成了何仙观公社，细麻搓成了一股绳，力量大了，社员们一商量，决定冬天全面修疏，破礁改滩，把这一段河变成畅流无阻，以便把越来越多的楠竹运出去，支援祖国建设。这是多么光荣而艰巨的任务啊！公社党委书记卿锡晋第二天就带领了几个“土”勘察技术员，出发前往勘察。老卿来到河畔，感到那么亲切。原来他家就是这个山冲里的，河畔是他小时候牧牛的场所，今天在这里放牧，明天又在那里放牧，河里什么地方有险滩、暗礁，全都看到，记在心里。这次沿河逐段勘探中，每当来到一个险滩和暗礁地方，他都是那么熟悉。但是他还是细致地观察，时而用尺量量，时而涉水下去亲身试探，然后当场绘图，详细记载，定出治理措施。
    10月下旬的一天，修疏进贤河的战斗开始了。由二百个民工、石工健儿们组成的修河队伍，在卿书记带领下奔赴前线。按照治河规划，他们除炸掉暗礁，加深改造险滩外，还要凿开一座小山。同时为了冬季水浅时也能流放竹排，在沿河要筑五座大石堰，以便蓄水开闸送排。这些工程中最大的也是最难搞的便是开凿寒木坳小山。它有五十米高、七十米厚，碎石组成，使河绕弯七里多路，形成了险滩。现在要把它劈开，把河身拉直，让水直流，真不容易。共产党员谢和云第一个站出来，请求党批准他去。接着，民工们一个接一个地站了出来。一共一百个人，一致推老谢当了工地主任。赶到寒木坳山，民工们立即拿起柴刀砍光了山上的灌木丛林，拿起镢头狠狠地挖；石工们拿起铁锤钢斩，凿石开炮炸山。开初一炮炸百多方碎石块，老谢不满足，就和石工们一起凿了个大石洞，一炮炸了七千多方碎石土方。这个创造，使工程旗开得胜，飞速前进。这时，别的工程也全都开工了。从早到晚，进贤河的下游沉浸在沸腾的声浪中：人们的劳动号子声，镢头的挖土声，炸石头的炮声，汇起来掩没了流水声。民工们学着红军长征时的英雄气概，吃在河畔，睡在河畔，战斗在河畔。陈荣宣他们三十个人在罗铺涧修石堰，周围几十里路无人家，是个虎狼窝。他们就用树枝架高棚防兽防风雨，坚持修下去。冬天，北风呼呼，河水冷得刺骨，石工们在自己的队长、共产党员夏雨元的带动下，在河边烧起了一堆堆的火。烤一阵又下水去打一阵石头，打一阵又上来烤一阵火，严寒在他们的面前低头了。冬去春来，大家的劲头更大了，工程进度也更快了，一座座水堰被筑了起来；一个个暗礁被炸掉了，一个又一个的浅滩被加深改造了过来；寒木坳也被挖去了五分之四。到3月里，除寒木坳山还待进一步开凿遗余的极小部分外，其余全部工程都如愿完成，进贤河的面貌从此焕然一新。
    春天的桃花汛期很快就来到了，进贤河的水量大涨，波浪翻滚。两岸的人们说不出的高兴。公社党委迅速组织了几百人的采伐队，上山大伐楠竹，又从山顶上架起溜槽和挖好溜坑，把楠竹从山头上一直流到河岸边。一百个人砍，只需三至五人流放就行了。比人背下山来提高工效近百倍。河岸边的竹子，立即被扎成一扎扎的竹排，乘水直下。放第一批竹排的是何仙观公社卫林场的运输工人。当他们驾着排经过原来的“棺材氹”、“老虎喉”、“神仙钻”等险滩时，水和湘江的水一样平静，再不是那样神魂不安了，流放时间也比过去减少三分之一。
    我们来这里访问时，正碰上天旱，虽然五十多天没有下雨了，但人们充分利用了石堰蓄水放排，竹排仍然在进贤河上奔流。半年多来，他们已经流放了一百三十多万根楠竹，相当于过去五年的运量。这些楠竹已在祖国各个建设工地上发挥了它的作用。（附图片）
