Xinhua News Agency, 12th – The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today regarding the issue of the United States creating tension in Laos.

The spokesperson pointed out that the situation in Laos has recently deteriorated further. The United States Department of State and the Laotian Sananikone government bear full responsibility for creating this situation. In order to completely eliminate the patriotic and democratic forces in Laos and completely transform Laos into a military base for the United States, the United States has instigated the Sananikone government to continue expanding the civil war, arrest leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and launch a comprehensive campaign of terror and suppression against former Pathet Lao combat personnel and Lao patriotic democrats throughout the country. The United States also induced the Laotian authorities to sign a joint Franco-Laotian communiqué, enabling a large number of U.S. military personnel to openly enter Laos and openly control the Laotian army. U.S. officers have now controlled the Laotian army from the headquarters to the training and command of each military district. The collusion between the Laotian authorities and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique under U.S. instigation has also become closer. The United States has also instigated Laos to sign a series of agreements with Thailand and South Vietnam, allowing U.S. weapons to enter Laos more easily, and attempting to gradually incorporate Laos into the U.S. military bloc system from military, political, economic, and other aspects in the form of bilateral agreements. The United States is also intensifying its activities in establishing and expanding military bases and intelligence dispatch stations near the borders of China and Vietnam.

The spokesperson emphasized that these actions by the United States and the Sananikone government are a serious violation of the 1954 Geneva Accords and the 1957 Vientiane Agreements and are the root cause of the tense situation in Laos today. The U.S. State Department's slander against China and Vietnam is merely a clumsy trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief.'"

The U.S. State Department has pretended that Laos, with a population of only about two million, could not possibly threaten the security of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The spokesperson pointed out that this is nothing more than sheer sophistry. No one believes that the Lao people pose a threat to the people of China and Vietnam, just as the people of China and Vietnam have never posed a threat to the Lao people. Historically, we and Laos have always lived in peace. If it were not for U.S. imperialism supporting and instigating the Lao Sananikone government to undermine the Geneva Accords, abandon the path of peace and neutrality, adopt a policy of hostility towards China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and allow the United States to establish and expand military bases and introduce U.S. military forces, China, Vietnam, and Laos could have lived together in peace and become close and friendly neighbors in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the Bandung spirit. However, in order to realize its ambition to expand its aggression and interference in Indochina and threaten China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the peaceful and neutral countries of Southeast Asia, the United States insists on turning Laos into a U.S. military base and gradually dragging Laos into the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, which of course constitutes a threat to China and Vietnam, as well as to the peace of the entire Southeast Asian region. The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 5 has sternly condemned the actions of the United States and the Sananikone government in betraying the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support this statement. We believe that only by stopping all measures by the United States and the Sananikone government that undermine the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, withdrawing all U.S. military personnel and military weapons, dismantling all U.S. military bases, restoring the normal supervisory activities of the International Commission, and thoroughly implementing the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, can the tense situation in Laos created by the United States be eliminated.

The spokesperson also pointed out that the United States and the Sananikone government are conspiring to submit the Laotian issue to the United Nations in order to drag other countries into the quagmire of U.S. aggression and interference in Laos and get rid of its own isolated position. Doing so is in itself a violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. Because the Laotian issue is the issue of the Laotian authorities faithfully fulfilling the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, this is an issue related to both parties to the Vientiane Agreements and the countries participating in the Geneva Conference, and the United Nations has no right to interfere at all.

The spokesperson finally stated that the Chinese government and the Chinese people are paying close attention to the deteriorating situation in Laos. All activities by the U.S. government and the Laotian authorities that violate the Geneva Accords and create tension in Indochina, thereby threatening China's security, will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The U.S. government and the Laotian authorities must bear full responsibility for the consequences of these activities.

　　我外交部发言人就日趋恶化的老挝局势发表谈话
　　坚决反对美国和老挝当局威胁和平
　　认为只有从老挝撤除美国军事人员和基地，恢复国际委员会的正常监察监督活动，彻底实现日内瓦协议和万象协议，才能消除美国一手造成的老挝紧张局势
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人今天就美国在老挝制造紧张局势问题发表谈话。
    发言人指出，老挝局势最近更加恶化了。对造成这种局势负完全责任的就是美国国务院和老挝萨纳尼空政府。为了彻底消灭老挝的爱国和民主力量，完全变老挝为美国的军事基地，美国策动萨纳尼空政府继续扩大内战，逮捕老挝爱国战线党的领导人，并在全国范围内发动了一个对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国民主人士的全面的恐怖镇压运动。美国还唆使老挝当局签订法国和老挝联合公报，使美国大批军事人员能够公开地进入老挝和公开地控制老挝军队。现在美国军官已经控制了老挝军队从指挥部到每一军区的训练和指挥。老挝当局在美国指使下同蒋介石集团残余武装的勾结也已经更加密切。美国还唆使它同泰国和南越签订一系列的协定，使美国武器能够更方便地进入老挝，并且企图以这种双边协定的形式从军事、政治、经济等各个方面逐步把老挝纳入美国的军事集团体系。美国在靠近中、越两国边境建立和扩大军事基地和特务派遣站的活动也正在加紧进行。
    发言人着重指出，美国和萨纳尼空政府的这些行为都是严重违反1954年日内瓦协议和1957年万象协议的，也是造成今天老挝紧张局势的根本原因。美国国务院对中、越两国的诬蔑只不过是一种拙劣的
  “贼喊捉贼”的伎俩而已。
    美国国务院曾佯称只有二百万左右人口的老挝不可能威胁中国和越南民主共和国的安全。发言人指出，这不过是彻头彻尾的诡辩。没有人认为老挝人民会构成对中、越两国人民的威胁，正像中、越两国人民从来也不构成对老挝人民的威胁一样。在历史上，我们和老挝从来就是和平相处的。如果不是美帝国主义支持和唆使老挝萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议，脱离和平中立道路，采取敌视中国和越南民主共和国的政策，准许美国建立和扩大军事基地，引进美国军事力量的话，中、越、老三国完全可以按照日内瓦协议和万隆精神和平相处，成为亲密友好的邻邦。但是美国为了实现它扩大对印度支那的侵略和干涉，威胁中国、越南民主共和国和东南亚和平中立国家的野心，硬要变老挝为美国的军事基地，逐步把老挝拖入东南亚侵略集团，这当然就构成了对中、越两国以及对整个东南亚地区和平的威胁。越南民主共和国外交部8月5日的声明已经严正谴责美国和萨纳尼空政府背弃日内瓦协议和万象协议的行为。中国政府和中国人民完全支持这一声明。我们认为，只有停止美国和萨纳尼空政府一切破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的措施，撤走所有美国军事人员和军火武器，撤除所有美国军事基地，恢复国际委员会的正常监察监督活动，彻底实现日内瓦协议和万象协议，才能消除美国所一手造成的老挝紧张局势。
    发言人还指出，美国和萨纳尼空政府正阴谋酝酿将老挝问题提交联合国，以便把其它一些国家拖入美国侵略和干涉老挝的泥坑中去，摆脱美国自己的孤立地位。这样做，本身就是对日内瓦协议和万象协议的破坏。因为老挝问题就是老挝当局必须忠实履行日内瓦协议和万象协议的问题，这是同万象协议双方和日内瓦会议与会各国有关的问题，联合国根本无权过问。
    发言人最后表示，中国政府和中国人民对于日趋恶化的老挝局势正予以密切注意，美国政府和老挝当局一切违反日内瓦协议和在印度支那制造紧张局势并进而威胁中国安全的活动，都必然要遭到中国政府和人民的坚决反对，美国政府和老挝当局必须对它们这些活动的后果负完全的责任。
