　　Strengthening Leadership, Reforming Tools, Improving Collaboration
　　Stations and Docks Implement Fast Loading and Unloading
　　Anhui Deploys Work Targeting Weak Transportation Links

　　(Our Dispatch from Hefei, August 12th) The Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Communications Work Department recently convened a province-wide symposium on station, dock, and port work. The meeting decided that while accelerating the reform of tools, improvements in loading and unloading should be made by strengthening leadership, improving collaboration, improving operational plan management, and rationally arranging labor, so that loading and unloading work can be closely linked to vehicle and vessel operations. This will improve the turnover rate of vehicles and vessels, and prepare for the heavy transportation tasks of the second half of the year.

　　The meeting analyzed the province's transportation situation, pointing out that the transportation tasks in the second half of the year will be heavier than in the first half. However, many vehicles and vessels will need to be repaired in the second half of the year, reducing the number of usable transportation tools compared to the first half. Under these circumstances, in addition to increasing transportation equipment, the main focus should be on tapping the potential of transportation to successfully complete the heavy transportation tasks in the second half of the year.

　　How can the potential of transportation be tapped? The meeting believes that the key issue is to vigorously improve the loading and unloading work at stations, docks, and ports. In the past, due to insufficient attention to loading and unloading work in various places, loading and unloading work has become a weak link in transportation work, failing to keep up with the needs of vehicle and vessel operations, and the phenomenon of vehicles and vessels waiting to be loaded and unloaded at stations, docks, and ports is serious. The meeting believes that to improve the efficiency of loading and unloading and reduce the labor intensity of workers, the central link is to accelerate tool reform, gradually realize the sliding, derricking, and mechanization of stations, docks, and ports, and eliminate shoulder carrying and manual lifting. In the tool reform, it is necessary to implement the principle of "from small to large, from indigenous to foreign." Currently, the focus should be on manufacturing and promoting tools that are highly efficient, save money and materials, and are easy to manufacture. In particular, attention should be paid to using the favorable terrain of stations, docks, and ports, using sliding and leverage forces as the power of tools, and manufacturing and promoting sliding slopes, platforms, high platforms, derricks, and other loading and unloading tools. In the tool reform, it is necessary to break through the unloading technology barrier and pay more attention to innovating unloading tools. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational leadership of tool reform, designate responsible cadres to be in charge, and strengthen the work of special management agencies. The meeting emphasized the need to strengthen operational plan management and rational arrangement of labor. The methods for strengthening operational plan management are: 1. Establish a daily production meeting system to specifically arrange the day's operational activities and study the next day's operational plan. In order to timely grasp temporary changes in vehicle and vessel arrivals and departures, dispatchers must go deep into the construction sites and flexibly and correctly dispatch loading and unloading operations according to the situation of the loading and unloading tasks at that time. 2. Strengthen the management of warehouses, tools, and labor, and fix the location of materials by variety. 3. Do a good job in communication and liaison work and improve the accuracy of vehicle and vessel arrival and departure forecasts. 4. Local transportation stations, docks, and ports should set loading and unloading operation indicators and stipulate the dwell time of vehicles and vessels at stations, docks, and ports. In terms of rational arrangement of labor, labor should be used according to the person and the matter, and a labor quota system should be implemented.

　　The meeting also called for strengthening collaboration between material consignment departments, vehicle and vessel operation departments, and port and station loading and unloading departments. The premise of strengthening this collaboration is to overcome departmentalism, establish a global perspective, and jointly arrange the work of their respective departments based on the principle of better completing transportation tasks. In addition, management should be strengthened centrally from the organizational level, with the operation department, loading and unloading department, and consignment department forming a joint command organization to uniformly dispatch labor, uniformly dispatch tools, and uniformly arrange loading and unloading operations, overcoming the lack of coordination between departments.

### 加强领导　改革工具　搞好协作　车站码头快装快卸　安徽针对运输薄弱环节布置工作

　　加强领导　改革工具　搞好协作
　　车站码头快装快卸
　　安徽针对运输薄弱环节布置工作
    本报合肥12日电　中共安徽省委交通工作部最近召开全省车站、码头、港口工作座谈会，决定在加速改革工具的同时，从加强领导、搞好协作、改进作业计划管理、合理安排劳动力方面来改进装卸工作，使装卸工作和车船运行密切衔接起来，提高车船的周转率，迎接下半年繁重的运输任务。
    会议分析了全省的运输形势，指出下半年运输任务比上半年更加繁重，但是，下半年有许多车船需要检修，能使用的运输工具比上半年减少。在这种情况下，除了增加交通设备以外，主要要靠挖掘运输上的潜力，才能很好地完成下半年繁重的运输任务。
    怎样才能挖掘运输上的潜力呢？会议认为，关键问题是要大力改进车站、码头、港口的装卸工作。过去，各地由于对装卸工作抓得不够，装卸工作成为运输工作中的薄弱环节，跟不上车船运行的需要，车船在车站、码头、港口等装待卸的现象严重。会议认为，要提高装卸工作效率，降低工人劳动强度，中心环节是要加速工具改革，逐步实现车站、码头、港口的滑道化、吊杆化和车子化，消灭肩扛、人抬现象。在工具改革中要贯彻由小到大，由土到洋的方针，目前要着重制造和推广工效高、省钱省料和制造简易的工具，其中特别要注意利用车站、码头、港口的有利地形，运用滑力和杠杆力作为工具的动力，制造和推广滑坡道、平台、高站台、吊杆等装卸工具。在工具改革中，要突破卸货技术关，多注意革新卸货工具。此外，要加强工具改革的组织领导，确定负责干部专管，并且加强专管机构的工作。会议强调要加强作业计划管理和合理安排劳动力。加强作业计划管理的办法是：一、建立日生产会议制度，具体地安排当天的作业活动，研究次日的作业计划。为了及时地掌握车船到发临时的变动，调度人员必须深入工地，根据当时装卸任务的情况，灵活而正确地调度装卸作业。二、加强对货栈、工具、劳力的管理，按品种固定物资的货位。三、做好通讯联络工作，提高车船到发预报的准确程度。四、地方交通的车站、码头、港口，要订出装卸作业指标，规定车船在车站、码头、港口的停留时间。在合理安排劳动力方面，要因人因事地使用劳力，实行劳动定员定额制度。
    会议还要求加强物资托运部门、车船运行部门和港、站装卸部门之间的协作。加强这种协作的前提，是要克服本位主义，树立全局观念，共同以更好地完成运输任务为原则来安排本部门的工作。另外，要从组织上加强集中管理，由运行部门、装卸部门和托运部门组成联合的指挥机构，统一调度劳动力，统一调度工具，统一安排装卸作业，克服各部门之间的不协调现象。
