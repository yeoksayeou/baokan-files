Strive for More New Factories to Begin Production
Harbin Over One Hundred Sixty Construction Units Speed Up Construction
Zhejiang Has Completed Twenty-Five Construction Projects in the First Half of the Year

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Harbin, August 2nd) Harbin city's various capital construction departments are taking measures to accelerate the progress of large-scale industrial construction projects. Currently, Harbin city leadership is focusing on finishing projects based on the priority of key projects, so that more construction projects can be put into production as early as possible.

This year, there are a total of one hundred and sixty-three construction units in Harbin city that are being expanded or newly built, including the expansion projects of the three major power plants of Harbin Electric Motor, Turbine, and Boiler factories, and key projects such as the Harbin Thermal Power Plant, Electric Carbon Factory, Electric Wire Factory, Bearing Factory, Forestry Machinery Factory, and Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Sciences, with a total construction area of over 1.3 million square meters. Among them, those that have been completed and put into production include the first phase of the Harbin Thermal Power Plant's new construction project, where a 25,000-kilowatt generator has already started generating electricity; the 8,000-square-meter forging workshop expanded by the Turbine Factory has undertaken most of the forging tasks for medium and small forgings, changing the situation where processing support was needed from other provinces in the past; and the 6,000-square-meter forging workshop recently built by the Harbin Bearing Factory has also begun forging large bearings, increasing the task by 2.4 times compared to last year. Projects entering the finishing or equipment installation stage include: the welding workshop and two hydraulic turbine test plants for the Harbin Electric Motor Factory, which are preparing to manufacture 72,500-kilowatt large generators, as well as oxygen workshops and comprehensive physical testing buildings; the third phase of expansion project under construction at this factory totals 60,000 square meters. Major projects in the second phase of the Harbin Boiler Factory's expansion project, covering more than 70,000 square meters, such as metal structures, air bag containers, and pipe workshops, are also nearing completion and equipment installation. It is estimated that the projects completed within the year will increase the factory's production capacity by about three times.

Large project volume, complex structure, tight deadlines, and insufficient raw materials and mechanical equipment are prominent contradictions in Harbin's capital construction this year. In order to ensure that the most important and urgent construction projects are completed on schedule and ahead of schedule, the Harbin city leadership has recently made overall arrangements for the use of construction forces and major raw materials. The Turbine Factory plans to concentrate the relatively tight supply of cement and small-sized steel first on the cast iron workshop, which urgently needs to be completed; the Boiler Factory plans to concentrate funds and cement on the equipment and building shells of key projects such as pipe and metal structure workshops. For key projects that are difficult for one construction unit to complete, Harbin city plans to systematically transfer technical forces from other construction units to cooperate and adopt joint construction methods to ensure completion. Harbin city's various capital construction departments are also adopting methods such as internal allocation, exchange of materials with production departments, mobilizing the masses to save raw materials, and carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements to solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment and accelerate the progress of the project. Currently, in order to ensure project quality, the city is carrying out a major quality inspection campaign. (Ji Jingru, Wu Jianmin, Chen Baoyu)

(Our newspaper's report) Zhejiang Province achieved great success in industrial capital construction in the first half of this year. The total amount of capital construction work increased by 31.5% compared with the same period last year, of which the local investment part increased by 80% compared with the same period last year, and the construction and installation workload increased by 27.8% compared with the same period last year. By the end of June, twenty-five major construction projects had been completed and put into production in a timely manner.

In the past six months, the new production capacity added and put into production in Zhejiang Province mainly includes: 30,000 tons of iron smelting, 20,000 tons of steel smelting, 26,000 tons of steel rolling, 65,000 tons of coking, 20,940 kilowatts of power generation equipment installed capacity, 1,000 tons of sulfuric acid, 2,000 tons of soda ash, 41,600 cotton yarn spindles, 4,000 tons of machine-made sugar, 2,500 tons of machine-made paper, etc. Those in trial production include: two converters in the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant, one converter in the Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant, one rolling mill in the Banshan Steel Rolling Plant, one rolling mill in the Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant, and a set of cement manufacturing equipment in the Jiangshan Cement Plant. The completion and commissioning of these projects will play a significant role in promoting the development of industrial production and supplying the needs of people's lives throughout the province.

Several large hydropower stations in Zhejiang Province are also accelerating construction while ensuring quality. For example, the third and fourth 7,500-kilowatt generator units of the Huangtankou Hydropower Station are being installed and will soon be completed; the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station dam is rapidly increasing in height and will enter the interception and water storage stage; and the Fuchunjiang Dam cofferdam will soon be closed and the foundation of the plant will be excavated.

In order to ensure project quality and construction safety, a "three inspections" campaign (inspection of progress, quality, and safety) centered on quality inspection was launched in the first quarter of this year. The method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, and combining design, construction, and construction units, was adopted to widely mobilize the masses to conduct comprehensive inspections of major construction projects, educating the employees on the capital construction front to have a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. On this basis, various rules and regulations related to improving project quality and ensuring construction safety, such as design drawing review, inspection of building materials, inspection of concealed works, quality self-inspection and mutual inspection, and safe operation of high-altitude and high-temperature operations, were formulated. After taking this series of measures, the quality of projects constructed in the first half of the year was generally good. (Attached picture)

    力争更多新厂投入生产
    哈尔滨一百六十多个建设单位加紧施工
    浙江上半年已经建成二十五个建设项目
    本报哈尔滨2日电　哈尔滨市各基建部门正在采取措施，为规模宏大的工业建设项目加快进度。目前，哈尔滨市的领导方面，根据重点工程的排队顺序，正在大抓收尾工程，让更多的建设项目及早投入生产。
    今年，哈尔滨市扩建和新建的建设单位共有一百六十三个，包括哈尔滨电机、汽轮机、锅炉等三大动力厂的扩建工程，哈尔滨热电站、电炭厂、电线厂、轴承厂、林业机械厂、黑龙江省科学分院等重点工程，建筑面积总共达一百三十余万平方米。其中已经建成投入生产的，像哈尔滨热电站第一期新建工程有二万五千瓩的发电机已经开始发电；汽轮机厂扩建的八千平方米锻工车间已经承担了大部分中、小锻件的锻造任务，改变了过去需要外省加工支援的局面；哈尔滨轴承厂刚建成的六千平方米的锻工车间，也已在开始锻造比去年任务增加二点四倍的大型轴承。工程进入收尾或安装设备阶段的有：哈尔滨电机厂准备制造七万二千五百瓩大型发电机的焊接车间和两所水轮机试验厂房以及氧气车间、综合性物理试验大楼等；这个厂正在施工的第三期扩建工程共达六万平方米。哈尔滨锅炉厂七万多平方米的第二期扩建工程中的主要项目，像金属结构、气包容器和管子车间等也已接近收尾和安装设备，预计年内建成的工程，将使这个厂的生产能力提高三倍左右。
    工程量大、结构复杂、工期紧迫，而原材料和机械设备不足，是今年哈尔滨基本建设中突出的矛盾。为了确保最重要、最急需的建设项目按期和提前完成，最近，哈尔滨市的领导方面，对施工力量和主要原材料的使用作了通盘安排。汽轮机厂准备把供应较紧的水泥及小规格钢材首先集中使用到急待完工的铸铁车间去；锅炉厂准备将资金和水泥集中使用在重点项目管子和金属结构等车间的设备和建筑外壳上。对那些靠一个建筑单位难于完成的重点工程，哈尔滨市准备有计划地抽调其他建筑单位的技术力量配合协作，采用联合施工的方法来保证完成。哈尔滨市各基建部门还采用内部调剂、与生产部门交流物资，以及发动群众节约原材料和开展技术革新、技术革命运动等方法，解决原材料和设备不足的困难，以加快工程的进度。目前，为了保证工程质量，全市正在开展质量大检查活动。（纪静如、吴建民、陈宝玉）
    本报讯　今年上半年，浙江省工业基本建设取得了巨大成绩。基本建设工作总量比去年同期增加31.5％，其中地方投资部分比去年同期增长80％，建筑安装工作量比去年同期增加27.8％。到6月底，已完成二十五个重大建设项目，并及时投入了生产。
    半年来，浙江省新增加并已经投入生产的生产能力主要有：炼铁三万吨、炼钢二万吨、轧钢二万六千吨、炼焦六万五千吨、发电设备装机容量二万零九百四十瓩、硫酸一千吨、纯碱二千吨、棉纱四万一千六百纱锭、机制糖四千吨、机制纸二千五百吨等等。正在进行试生产的有：半山钢铁厂转炉二座，绍兴钢铁厂转炉一座，半山轧钢厂轧机一台，绍兴钢铁厂轧机一台，江山水泥厂制造水泥设备一套等。这些工程的竣工和投入生产，对促进全省工业生产的发展和供应人民生活需要，将起重大作用。
    浙江省几个大水电站也在保证质量的前提下加快建设。如黄坛口水电站第三台、第四台七千五百瓩发电机组正在安装并即将竣工；新安江水电站大坝正在迅速升高并将进入截流蓄水阶段；富春江大坝围堰即将闭气并将开挖厂房基础。
    为了保证工程质量和施工安全，今年第一季度开展了以查质量为中心的“三查”运动（查进度、查质量、查安全）。采取领导干部、技术人员和工人群众相结合，设计、施工和建设单位相结合的办法，广泛发动群众，对主要工程项目，全面地进行了检查，教育基本建设战线上的职工，更全面、更深刻地认识多快好省的建设方针。在这基础上，制订了设计图纸会审、建筑材料的检验、隐蔽工程的检验、质量自检与互检、高空高温作业安全操作等各项有关提高工程质量、保证施工安全的规章制度。采取了这一系列措施以后，上半年施工的工程质量一般较好。（附图片）
