    In an office in the Yuzhong Engineering Area, we listened to the sounds of explosions in the distance, and also to Comrade Yang Kai telling vivid stories. He is the Party Secretary of the Yuzhong Engineering Area, who fought in the army and led agricultural production in the county, and is now leading people to split mountains. He is a man who loves his subordinates. Whenever he talked about their blasting workers, he was always excited, his eyebrows danced, he praised them incessantly, and he was accompanied by hearty laughter. It was through his introduction that I learned about Zhang Xingyu, a sheepskin raft operator: a twenty-four-year-old young man, loyal to his duties, unafraid of dangers and difficulties.
    "The Tao River is very rapid, with shallow beaches everywhere, and many large rocks are exposed on the surface of the water. If you are not careful, the sheepskin raft will be damaged. Zhang Xingyu, in order to cooperate with the breakthrough of one hundred cubic meters, installed a generator on a sheepskin raft and paddled for more than 20 kilometers in the river at night, safely delivering the generator to the Sixth Brigade. He has enthusiasm, courage, and skill."
    Comrade Yang Kai, felt that this introduction seemed incomplete, and added:
    "He never knows fatigue and never bargains about anything he does. He is a raft operator and a dispatcher. When transporting materials, he also helps others mail letters and even takes care of fetching medicine. When he returns home, he is also half a cook." He paused and praised: "His technique is really high. When others paddle rafts across the river, they go diagonally, but he goes straight across."
    I had already heard many thrilling and magical stories about sheepskin rafts in Lanzhou. A long time ago, a foreigner (nationality unknown) took a sheepskin raft from Lanzhou to Yinchuan. On the way, through a mountain gorge, huge rocks extended into the river, and the vortex in the middle was very large. When the raft reached here, it rushed straight towards a large rock with the rapid current. Just as it was about to hit, the foreigner was frightened and jumped onto the large rock. The raft operator gently touched the stone with a paddle, and the raft brushed past the stone, then circled around the edge of a vortex, and then shot downstream like an arrow. The foreigner stood on the rock, and when he saw a raft coming, he waved and shouted, hoping someone would rescue him. However, no one dared to stop there, and it was impossible to stop at all.
    Think about it! Inflating several whole sheepskins and tying them to a square wooden frame, the raft operator holds a paddle less than five feet long and less than half a foot wide, fully loaded with goods, jumping from one wave to another on the turbulent Yellow River. What an interesting means of transportation this is. In ancient books, this tool is called "Huntuo."
    Because of my interest in sheepskin rafts, and with Comrade Yang Kai's promotion, I wanted to talk to Zhang Xingyu in detail. Unfortunately, he had left and had not returned. Later, at another construction site, I met a comrade from the Engineering Bureau who was in charge of youth work. He had lived with Zhang Xingyu for a few days, and from him I learned more systematically about Zhang Xingyu's situation.
    Zhang Xingyu was not originally a raft operator. He signed up to go to the Tao River to learn blasting. For the first two months, he went up the mountain to pry stones, and worked on the Lama Cliff and Motian Mountain ridges. Later, he learned to drill holes, load explosives, and set off explosions, and quickly mastered general blasting techniques. One day at the end of August 1958, he returned from work, and the secretary of the brigade's general branch smiled and said to him:
    "Zhang Xingyu, we plan to transfer you to the raft team to do transportation work, is that okay?"
    "Okay," Zhang Xingyu replied casually, thinking it was a joke.
    "Okay, then move your luggage."
    "Alright."
    It was true. He went back and thought about it all night, hesitant and a little scared. In the past, in Yuzhong County, he had released rafts for half a year when he was a teenager, but he hadn't done it for many years. From Shimen Gully to Lama Cliff, the water was rapid, not to mention the dozen or so dangerous shoals and dozen or so bends, with reefs everywhere. If the raft broke and the materials were lost in the river, wouldn't that be a big loss! Besides, he had just learned blasting and was reluctant to leave. After thinking it over, he decided to go paddle rafts. He thought: he was a good member of the Communist Youth League in the commune and didn't bargain about any work, and he should do the same this time. At dawn, he ran to the transportation team, carried a raft, and went to Shimen Gully.
    When he arrived at the transportation team, he was assigned to work with the old raft operator Teng Baoqian. The leadership instructed Lao Teng to help Xiao Zhang more. Teng Baoqian had more than thirty years of raft paddling history. From Lanzhou to Yinchuan, passing the famous "Foreigner Waving" rock, he had experienced all the risks on the Yellow River as if walking on flat ground. With a few sheepskins and a few sticks, he could transport a mountain across the river. For the first two trips, Teng Baoqian paddled in front, and Zhang Xingyu followed behind, mainly to familiarize himself with the waterway, remember where the bends were, where the shoals were, where the reefs were, where the vortexes were, where the rapids were... Zhang Xingyu stared intently at the raft in front, following the same path, not daring to be careless, for fear of capsizing the raft. After running for two days, Lao Teng saw that Xiao Zhang was very clever, and on the third day he played a joke on Xiao Zhang. There were two dangerous shoals on the road, with a waterway in between. The general way to go was to pull the raft onto the upstream path and go down along the waterway. This time, the old raft operator didn't take the waterway, but rushed straight towards a reef, and skillfully brushed past the reef. Zhang Xingyu also rushed down the same way, suddenly discovered the reef, and immediately broke out in a cold sweat. He quickly used a paddle to push away, and although he didn't hit the stone, the wave almost capsized the raft.
   "To paddle a raft, you have to watch the waterway, you have to see far, and your hands and feet have to be quick..." Lao Teng said with a smile.
    Difficulties came again. Blasting was taking place on the mountain, and the blasted rocks rolled into the river. Yesterday's waterway was here, but today it had changed again, and the changes in the water flow were too frequent. Xiao Zhang tried hard to adapt to this change in the water flow. In the water, he paddled hard with both hands, watched ahead alertly with his eyes, and judged various situations decisively in his heart, letting the raft full of materials go down the current! He was bold, careful, calm, and decisive, trip after trip...
    From Shimen Gully to Lama Cliff and Xiadawo, more than thirty miles, paddling the raft down and carrying the raft up was the difficulty for the raft operators. The sheepskin raft had no power; it could only go downstream and could not go upstream. No matter how far the road was, it was paddled down and carried up. A raft tied with twelve sheepskins weighed seventy or eighty pounds! In the beginning, Xiao Zhang paddled one trip a day. Later, the engineering tasks were tight, and there were many materials needed. Xiao Zhang suggested to other raft operators to send twice a day. When others were unwilling, he took the lead in letting the raft go down. Sometimes, when others stopped, he carried other people's rafts up... His actions moved everyone, and from then on, it was two trips a day.
    The engineering tasks became tighter and tighter, and two trips a day could not transport the required materials to the work section. The engineering area proposed a trial night voyage. Zhang Xingyu signed up for the first trip.
    There was a moon on the night of the trial voyage. Zhang Xingyu thought it was a good opportunity, but unexpectedly it brought even greater difficulties. The moonlight and the water light were connected together! He couldn't see the waves, he couldn't see the things in the shadows, he couldn't see the path of the water flow, he couldn't recognize what was a stone and what was a shadow. The shadows of the trees were dancing, and the shadows of the high mountains were dancing on the water surface, with bizarre phantoms dancing everywhere... He paddled carefully, and his eyes ached. His vision was suddenly confused by a wave, and the raft bumped towards a reef. When he realized it, it was already very close, and he broke out in another cold sweat. That night, he finally reached his destination smoothly. From then on, Zhang Xingyu fought the sun during the day and the stars at night, and he also released rafts at night!
    September was the flood season for the Tao River, and the flood increased the power of the rapids. At this time, Zhang Xingyu became bolder. On nights without a moon, he still released rafts. What a tense labor it was! In the pitch-black night, nothing could be seen. Zhang Xingyu, this young raft operator, relied entirely on his professional instinct to operate the raft with thousands of pounds of force, going downstream. This professional instinct made his hands and feet more agile. Zhang Xingyu was able to find the correct method from many signs such as the pitch of the water sound, the speed of the water flow, the size of the raft's turbulence, the weight of the paddle, and the balance of his own body, allowing the raft to move steadily forward. Zhang Xingyu's technique had reached such a height that in winter, the riverbanks were covered with knife-like thin ice, which could cut through the sheepskins at any time, but he still paddled the raft back and forth on the waves as usual.
    The explosives used to level Lama Cliff, the food and vegetables people ate, the medicines used by medical personnel, and the progress of the project all had Zhang Xingyu's labor in them. In those tense days of fighting high mountains, Zhang Xingyu could work day and night. Whenever there was something to do, he would set off. He would put down his bowl before finishing his meal and leave. On the road, if someone wanted to cross the river, he would call out, and he would immediately dock. If something fell into the water, no matter what it was, he would jump into the water and retrieve it. He could help others take letters to mail, and he would put them in his pocket even if they didn't have stamps! He could help patients fetch medicine, no matter how far the road was! He was also busy helping the kitchen fetch water and cook! He loved rafts, he loved transportation work, and he also loved everything he could do to help others. He was a restless person. Many people knew him, many people were grateful to him, many people loved and respected him, and many people could talk about his deeds. However, Zhang Xingyu himself rarely talked about himself. In January of this year, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and became a probationary member. Since then, he has worked even harder and has also taken on two apprentices. He looked at others with a smile and said: "Let's work hard, comrades. When the water flows through Dayingliang, I will also paddle a raft along the Milky Way for a tour, and you can all ride on it!"

    筏子手
    本报记者　顾雷
    在榆中工区的一间办公室里，我们听着远处爆破的响声，也听着杨凯同志讲着生动的故事。他是榆中工区的党委书记，在部队里打过仗，在县里领导过农业生产，现在领导着人们劈山。这是个热爱自己部下的人。每谈到他们的爆破手，总是兴高采烈，眉飞色舞，称赞不绝，而且夹带着朗朗的笑声。我是由于他的介绍，才知道皮筏子手张星玉的：二十四岁的青年，一个忠于职守、不畏艰险、不怕困难的人。
      “洮河的水很急，到处有浅滩，许多大石头露在水面，一不小心，皮筏子会被撞坏。张星玉，为了配合再突破一百方关，把一台发电机装在羊皮筏子上，夜里在河里划了二十多公里，安全地把发电机送到了第六大队。有热情、有胆量、有技术。”
    杨凯同志说到这里，觉得似乎对这个人介绍得很不完全，又说道：
    “从不知道累，干什么事都不讲价钱。他是皮筏子手，又是调运员，运送物资的时候，还代别人寄信，连抓药的事也管上了。回到家里，又是半个炊事员。”他停了停，又夸奖道：“技术真高，别人划筏子过河时斜着走，他呀，直着就过去了。”
    关于皮筏子惊险、神奇的故事，我在兰州已经听到很多了。很久以前，有一个外国人
  （那国人不知道），乘羊皮筏子从兰州去银川。路上经过的一个山峡，有巨石伸到河里，中间的旋涡很大，筏子划到这里，顺着急流直奔一块大石头撞去。快要碰上的时候，这个外国人害怕了，一跃而跳上了大石头，筏子手用划板对石头轻轻一点，筏子从石旁擦过去，接着在一个旋涡的边沿上绕一圈，然后箭一样向下水射去了。那个外国人站在石头上，一看有筏子过来，又招手，又叫喊，希望有人把自己救走。可是，没有人敢在那里停下，也根本无法停下。
    想想吧！把几个整羊皮吹上气，绑在一个方方的木架子上，筏子手拿着一块长不满五尺，宽不满半尺的划板，满载着货物，在黄河的惊涛骇浪上，由这个浪头跳到另一个浪头。这是多么有意思的运输工具。在古书的记载上，这种工具叫做“浑脱”。
    由于我对皮筏子有兴趣，又加上杨凯同志的宣传，我想找张星玉详细谈谈。不巧，他出发没有回来。后来在另外一个工地上，遇到了工程局做青年工作的一位同志，他曾和张星玉一起生活过几天，从他那里我知道了张星玉较为系统的情况。
    张星玉原来不是筏子手。报名到洮河，学爆破。头两个月，上山撬石头，和拉马崖、摩天山岭干上了。后来，学着打眼、装药、放炮，很快掌握了一般的爆破技术。1958年8月底的一天，他下工回来，大队总支书记笑着向他说：
    “张星玉，准备把你调到皮筏队搞运输工作，行不行？”
    “行。”张星玉漫不经心的答道，以为是说着玩的。
    “行，那就搬行李去吧。”
    “好吧。”
    事情是真的了。他回去，想了一个晚上，犹豫不定，又有些害怕。过去，在榆中县，十几岁的时候，放过半年筏子，已有多年不干了。从石门沟到拉马崖，水急不说，还有十几个险滩，十几个湾，到处都是礁石，万一筏子碰坏，物资丢到河里，不是大损失吗！再说，刚刚学会爆破，又舍不得走开。想来想去，还是决定去划筏子。他想：自己在公社里是个好团员，对任何工作都不讨价钱，这回也要这样。天一亮，他跑到运输组，扛了筏子，奔石门沟了。
    到了运输组，被分配和老筏子手滕保乾在一起。领导上交代老滕，要多帮助小张。滕保乾已有三十多年划筏子的历史了。从兰州到银川，经过著名的那块“洋人招手”石头，如履平地，黄河上什么风险都经历过。有几张羊皮、几根棍子，他可以把一座山运过河去。头两趟，滕保乾在前边划，张星玉在后面跟，主要是熟悉水路，记住那里是湾，那里是滩，那里是礁石，那里是旋涡，那里是急流……。张星玉两眼死瞪着前边的筏子，前边怎样走，自己怎样走，一点都不敢马虎，唯恐翻了筏子。跑了两天，老滕看小张挺机灵，第三天跟小张开了个玩笑。路上有两个险滩，中间有一条水巷，一般的走法是把筏子拨在上水路上，顺着水巷下去，这回老筏子手不走水巷，一直奔一个礁石冲去，而且巧妙的从礁石旁边擦过去了。张星玉也照样冲下去了，突然发现了礁石，登时出了一身汗，很快用划板一拨，虽然没有碰上石头，浪头几乎把筏子打翻了。
   “划筏子，要看水路，要看的远，手脚要快……”老滕笑嘻嘻地说。
    困难又来了。山上在爆破，炸开的石头滚在河里，昨天的水巷在这里，今天又换了个地方，水流的变化太频繁了。小张努力适应水流的这种变化。在水里，他两手用力地划着，眼睛机灵地向前看着，心里果敢的判断各种情况，把满载物资的筏子顺流放了下去！他大胆、细心、沉着、果断，一趟又一趟……。
    从石门沟到拉马崖、下大窝，三十多里路，划着筏子下去，扛着筏子上来，这是筏子手的难处。皮筏子没有动力，它只能顺流而下，不能逆流而上，无论多远的路都是划下去，扛上来。绑上十二个羊皮的筏子，有七八十斤重呢！开始，小张每天划一趟。后来，工程任务紧，需要的物资多，小张向其他筏子手建议每天送两次。别人不乐意时，他带头把筏子放下去。有时，别人不走了，他把别人的筏子扛上……。他的行动感动了大家，从此都是每天两趟了。
    工程任务愈来愈紧，一天两趟，还不能把需要的物资运到工段去。工区提出试行夜航。张星玉报名，走头一趟。
    试航的那天夜晚有月亮，张星玉以为这是好机会，想不到却带来了更大的困难，月光和水光连在一起了！他看不见翻起的浪花，看不见阴影下的东西，看不清水流的道路，认不出那是石头，那是影子。树影幢幢，高山的阴影在水面上跳动，到处跳动着离奇的幻影……。他小心地划着，眼睛都瞅疼了。他的视觉突然被一片浪花迷惑了，筏子向一块礁石碰去，当他发觉时，已经很近，又被惊出了一身冷汗。这天夜里，他终于顺利到达了目的地。从此，张星玉日战太阳夜战星，夜里也放开筏子了！
    9月，是洮河涨水的季节，洪水加大了急流的力量。这时，张星玉胆子大了。没有月亮的夜晚，照样放筏子。多么紧张的劳动啊！漆黑的夜里，什么都看不见。张星玉，这个年青的筏子手，完全依靠职业的本能，操纵着带有千万斤冲力的筏子，顺水而下。这种职业的本能，使他的手脚更加敏捷。张星玉能够从水声的高低，水流的缓急，筏子颠波的大小，划板的轻重，自己身体的平衡等许多迹象里找到正确的方法，让筏子稳稳地前进。张星玉的技术，竟达到了这样的高度：冬天，河两岸挂满了刀刃似的薄冰，随时都可以把羊皮割破，而他却照常划着筏子在水浪上荡来荡去。
    削平拉马崖用的炸药，人们吃的粮食和蔬菜，医务人员用的药品，工程的进度，都有张星玉的劳动在里面。在那大战高山的紧张日子 里，张星玉可以昼夜不停地工作，什么时候有事，他什么时候动身，没吃完饭放下碗就走。路上，有人要过河，叫一声，他马上靠岸。有什么东西掉到水里了，不管是什么，跳下水就捞。他，可以帮助别人带信去寄，没贴邮票也往口袋里装！他，可以帮助病人抓药，不管路多远！他，也忙着帮助厨房挑水、烧火！他，爱筏子，爱运输工作，也爱一切能帮助别人的事情，是一个闲不住的人，许多人认识他，许多人感激他，许多人爱戴他，许多人都能讲一讲他的事迹。可是，张星玉自己却很少谈到自己。今年1月，他光荣地参加了中国共产党，成为预备党员。从那时起，他工作得更有劲了，还带了两个徒弟。他笑哈哈地望着别人说：“加油干吧，同志们，等到水通大营梁，我还顺着银河划着筏子去逛一趟呢，你们坐上！”（附图片）
