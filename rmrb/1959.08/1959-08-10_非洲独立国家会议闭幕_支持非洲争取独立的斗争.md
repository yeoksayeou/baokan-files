Xinhua News Agency, Monrovia, 9th - The African Independent States Conference held in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, West Africa, closed on August 8th.

The conference discussed major issues closely related to the interests of the people of African countries, such as the Algerian War, France's planned nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert, the independence of Cameroon, and racial discrimination, and adopted corresponding resolutions.

The resolution on the Algerian issue, unanimously adopted by the conference, demanded that France recognize the Algerian people's right to self-determination and independence, end hostilities, and withdraw all its troops from Algeria.

The resolution also called on France to hold negotiations with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, and hoped that all peoples and governments in the world would support and recognize the Algerian Provisional Government. It also called on independent African countries to provide material assistance to Algeria.

In another resolution, the conference strongly and indignantly condemned the French government's decision to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert or any other region of Africa.

The conference welcomed the forthcoming independence of French Cameroon in January 1960, but expressed regret at the current situation in Cameroon. The resolution adopted by the conference on this issue considered that holding elections under UN supervision before Cameroon's independence was the most effective and democratic way to resolve the current crisis in Cameroon. The conference also requested that this issue be included in the agenda of the next UN General Assembly.

The conference passed a resolution condemning all forms of racial discrimination and apartheid in the world, especially the policies of racial discrimination practiced in the Union of South Africa, the Central African Federation, and Kenya. The conference stated that it was particularly concerned about the brutal methods of racial discrimination adopted by the government of the Union of South Africa. The conference began on August 4th. Dozens of government representatives from nine independent African countries, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan, and the United Arab Republic, attended the conference. A delegation from the Algerian Provisional Government, headed by Minister of Propaganda Yazid, also attended the conference. During the conference, the Guinean delegation announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Algerian Provisional Government.

The conference also heard petitions from representatives from non-independent African regions such as Uganda, Angola, and Nyasaland, requesting people of conscience around the world and member states of the United Nations to help these regions realize their legitimate aspirations and gain independence in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.

The conference expressed concern about the situation in Southwest Africa, demanding that the government of the Union of South Africa fulfill the UN resolution and place Southwest Africa under the international trusteeship system; and called on the United Nations to determine the date of independence for Southwest Africa. The conference called on the British government to respect the UN Charter, consider the political aspirations of the people of Nyasaland and their rights to self-government and independence. The conference unanimously demanded that the British government lift the "state of emergency" declared in Nyasaland, release all illegally arrested people of Nyasaland, and revoke the ban on the Nyasaland African National Congress.

    会议欢迎法属喀麦隆将在1960年1月实现独立，但是对于喀麦隆目前的局势表示遗憾。会议就这个问题通过的决议认为，在喀麦隆独立前举行联合国监督下的选举是解决喀麦隆目前危机的最有效和民主的方法。会议还要求把这一问题列入下届联合国大会的议程。

    这次会议还听取了来自乌干达、安哥拉和尼亚萨兰等非洲尚未独立地区的代表们的请愿，要求全世界有良心的人们和联合国成员国帮助这些地区实现它们的合法愿望，并且根据联合国宪章获得独立。
    会议对西南非洲的局势表示焦虑，要求南非联邦政府履行联合国的决议，把西南非洲置于国际托管制度之下；并且呼吁联合国确定西南非洲的独立日期。会议呼吁英国政府尊重联合国宪章，考虑尼亚萨兰人民的政治愿望和他们的自治和独立权利。会议一致要求英国政府取消在尼亚萨兰宣布的“紧急状态”，释放所有非法逮捕的尼亚萨兰人民，并且撤销关于取缔尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的禁令。
