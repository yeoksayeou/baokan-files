Wresting Vegetables from the Heavens
Cheng Songtao

Since the beginning of August, torrential rains have been falling one after another, and many vegetable fields in the suburbs of Beijing have been flooded. In this season of continuous heavy rain and extreme production difficulties, the members of the Taipingqiao Sixth Production Team of the Lugouqiao Commune's Sanluju Brigade have launched an intense battle to seize vegetables from the heavy rain, to ensure the people of the city have vegetables to eat.

This production team consists of fifty-nine households of commune members, managing more than 170 mu of vegetable fields and 40 mu of large fields. Before the flooding, this team's production was excellent, delivering 10,000 to 20,000 jin of fresh vegetables to the market every day. By the day of the flood, they had planted 71 mu of Lianqiu and summer-sown vegetables and 85 mu of autumn-sown vegetables, but after several heavy rains, most of them were flooded.

The members of this team were not intimidated by this once-in-a-century heavy rain. Under the leadership of the Party organization, they rose up and fought heroically.

On the evening of August 6th, the rain was still pouring down. Production Captain and Communist Party member Song Zhenhai came out of his house and found Deputy Captain Liu Guihua. He impatiently said, "The carts aren't moving, the bells aren't ringing, we have to work!" Liu Guihua nodded in agreement, and immediately called a cadre meeting. Production team leaders, technicians, and Youth League group leaders and above came to the team headquarters in the rain.

Song Zhenhai said at the meeting, "When soldiers come, we will block them; when water comes, we will dam it. We must not just watch our vegetables be flooded!" Finally, it was decided that each group would raise another 150 seedling beds tomorrow.

The next day, August 7th, just as dawn broke, the sound of the bell "dang, dang, dang..." echoed, and before long, more than seventy commune members, carrying four-pronged hoes, iron rakes, and picking baskets, came to the team headquarters in droves, five or six people more than usual.

The captain excitedly announced the battle plan: five large carts and ten people to deliver manure; twelve people to rush the harvest; two people to dry vegetable seeds; four people to rescue flooded vegetables; and the rest of the people to re-grow vegetable seedlings.

The two captains and the statistician spent the afternoon clarifying the team's "assets" by land number and plot, and, based on the principles of "benefiting National Day supply, benefiting autumn vegetable development, and benefiting the compensation of flood losses" and "planting on high ground, transplanting in low-lying areas," they reorganized the "double insurance" production plan. The result of the arrangement was: the team's 172 mu of land increased from the original 20 crops to 23 crops; the autumn vegetable area increased from the original 123 mu to 179 mu. Among them, the vegetables supplied for National Day were 41 mu, an increase of one mu compared to the 40 mu before the flood; the Chinese cabbage was 51 mu, an increase of more than 6 mu compared to the original plan. By implementing this plan, the losses from the flood can be compensated.

After the draft plan was drawn up, a team-wide commune member meeting was held that evening. As soon as the plan was announced, it was drowned out by a burst of applause. At this time, someone said, "The plan is good, but it can't be realized without fertilizer."

Everyone was stunned when this question was raised.

"That's right! There are many difficulties in implementing this plan. The purpose of today's meeting is to have everyone come up with ideas and solutions together." As soon as the captain finished speaking, the meeting became lively.

Technician Li Deshan stood up and said, "If we don't have fertilizer, we can accumulate it!" Female commune member Jiao Shuzhen added, "Our family's kang hasn't been dismantled and replaced for fifteen or sixteen years. Dismantling one kang to plant three mu of vegetables is no problem."

As soon as the idea of dismantling the kang was raised, other ideas followed one after another. Some suggested that the team had two large manure pits that hadn't been dug for several years, which could yield 50,000 to 60,000 jin of good fertilizer. Some said: Commune members' homes, pig farms, and livestock sheds have very good fertilizer piled up, and collecting it would amount to 140,000 to 150,000 jin. Some said: We can collect our own manure, and four large manure pits have already stored 4,000 buckets. In this way, the problem was solved.

After the commune member meeting, the commune members threw themselves into the intense battle with a spirit of selfless labor.

The twelve young men of Liu Kun's youth commando team took the lead, fighting continuously for three nights until after 11 p.m. The women were not willing to fall behind either. Women's team leader Pang Xiuzhen led seven commune members to pull up frames, pull up vines, eliminate weeds, and clear land.

After three days of intensive drainage and rescue, 17.5 mu of Lianqiu and summer-sown vegetables have been restored to life. In addition to the newly arranged rush planting of 24 mu of fresh vegetables, it is expected that more than 160,000 jin can be supplied during the National Day period, an increase of 63.4% compared to the original allocated task of 100,000 jin. At the same time, 276 more seedling beds were raised, and more than 6 mu of fast-maturing vegetables were planted. (Attached picture)

    和老天争夺蔬菜
    成松涛
    进入8月以来，瓢泼似的大雨一场连着一场，京郊很多菜田被淹没了。就在这大雨连绵，生产十分困难的季节里，芦沟桥公社三路居大队太平桥第六生产队的社员们，为了保证城市人民有菜吃，展开了和大雨夺菜的紧张战斗。
    这个生产队，共有五十九户社员，经营着一百七十多亩菜田和四十亩大田。在雨涝以前，这个队生产搞得很好，每天都往市场送一、两万斤鲜菜。到雨涝之日止，又种了恋秋和夏播菜七十一亩，秋播菜八十五亩，但是经过几场大雨，绝大部分都淹了。
    这个队的社员们没有被这百年未遇的大雨吓倒，在党组织的领导下，他们起来英勇地战斗了。
    8月6日傍晚，雨还不住的下，生产队长、共产党员宋振海从家里出来，找到了副队长刘贵华。他急不可待地说：“大车不动，铃当不响，咱们得干啊！”刘贵华点了点头表示同意，于是立即召开干部会。生产组长、技术员和团小组长以上干部冒雨来到了队部。
    宋振海在会上说：“兵来将挡，水来土掩，咱们的菜决不能眼巴巴地让它淹！”最后决定：每个组明天再养一百五十畦苗。
    第二天——8月7日，天刚蒙蒙亮，“当、当、当……”的钟声回荡着，不大一会，七十多个社员都拿着四齿、铁钯、摘筐、熙熙攘攘地来到队部，比往常还多了五、六个人。
    队长兴奋地宣布了作战计划：五辆大车、十个人送粪；十二个人抢收菜；两个人晾菜籽；四个人抢救涝菜；其余的人都去重养菜苗。
    两个队长和统计员用一下午时间，按地号、排地块摆情况，先亮清了全队的“底”。又本着“有利国庆供应，有利秋菜发展，有利弥补涝灾损失”和“高地种、洼地栽”的原则，重新安排了“双保险”的生产计划。安排的结果是：全队一百七十二亩地，由原来二十种作物增为二十三种作物；秋菜面积由原来的一百二十三亩增加到一百七十九亩。其中供应国庆节的菜四十一亩，比被涝前四十亩还增加了一亩；大白菜五十一亩，较原计划增加六亩多，实现了这个计划，涝灾损失可以弥补。
    计划草案订出后，当天傍晚，召开了全队社员大会。计划一宣布，就被一阵掌声淹没了。这时有人说，“计划好是好，就是没肥料实现不了。”
    这个问题一提出，大家都楞住了。
      “对！实现这个计划是有很多困难的，今天召开大会，就是让大家共同拿主意想办法。”队长话一落音，会场就热闹起来了。
    技术员李德山站起来说：“没有肥料咱们可以积！”女社员焦淑珍补充说：“我们家的炕已经十五、六年没拆换了，拆一铺炕种三亩菜也没问题。”
    拆炕的主意一提出来，其他主意也接二连三地提出来了。有的提出全队有两个大粪坑，几年没挖了，足能挖出五、六万斤好肥料。有的说：社员家、猪场、牲口棚堆放着很好的肥料，搜集起来足有十四、五万斤。有的说：咱们自己掏粪稀，四个大粪坑已存了四千桶。这样，问题解决了。
    社员大会开过以后，社员们以忘我的劳动精神投入了紧张的战斗。
    刘昆青年突击组的十二个小伙子一马当先，连续三个晚上夜战到十一点多钟。妇女也不肯落后。妇女组长庞秀珍领着七个社员拔架、拉秧、灭草、腾地。
    经过三天突击排水、抢救，有十七亩半恋秋和夏播菜，已经恢复了生机，加上新安排抢种的二十四亩鲜菜，预计在国庆节期间可以供应十六万多斤，较原分配十万斤任务增加了63.4％。同时，增养了菜苗二百七十六畦，抢播快熟菜六亩多。（附图片）
