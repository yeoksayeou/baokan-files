Turning Harm into Good
Shi Xiao

In the process of accumulating fertilizer, collecting human and animal waste, garbage, and sewage, and treating them through closed fermentation and other methods can not only kill parasite eggs and germs, eliminate crop diseases, pests, and weed seeds, but also improve fertilizer efficiency. It's truly killing two birds with one stone!

Taking parasite eggs and germs as an example, unfermented feces, garbage, and other wastes often contain a large amount of them, which can easily mix into drinking water, vegetables, fruits, and other foods and invade the human body. Some can even invade the body through the skin, posing a great threat to health. Beijing conducted tests on the roundworm egg and germ index of feces and other substances and found that one gram of dry feces contained 432 million bacteria and 1,232 roundworm eggs; one gram of diluted feces contained 17 million bacteria and 960 roundworm eggs. There are many types of parasites, and even more harmful ones include hookworms, tapeworms, and schistosomes, all of which excrete eggs in the feces. Diseases such as typhoid and dysentery are also mainly spread through the feces of patients. However, the amount of feces, garbage, and other wastes is very large, and a simple way to render them harmless is through airtight fermentation. According to experiments, the temperature of mud-sealed composting and other fermentation methods can reach as high as 70 degrees Celsius, while the heat resistance of these eggs and bacteria, even at their highest, cannot withstand a continuous high temperature of 65 degrees Celsius for dozens of hours. Moreover, airtight fermentation can also improve fertilizer efficiency.

From the current situation, whether it is the method of airtight fermentation in manure pits adopted in some parts of the south, or the method of mud-sealed composting and mud-sealed fertilizer accumulation adopted in some parts of the north, they are all more effective than open-air fertilizer composting. The Beijing Municipal Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Station once conducted chemical analysis of the fertilizer efficiency of fertilizers accumulated using three different treatment methods. One gram of sun-dried feces contained 0.15% nitrogen, 1.96% phosphorus, and 0.76% potassium; while the nitrogen content of diluted feces fermented in manure pits and fertilizers from mud-sealed composting was much higher, and the content of phosphorus and potassium was also higher when calculated on a pure manure basis. For example, one gram of diluted feces contains 0.95% nitrogen, 0.73% phosphorus, and 0.59% potassium; one gram of compost (with a ratio of feces to garbage of 1:5) contains 0.30% nitrogen, 0.58% phosphorus, and 0.48% potassium. It can be seen that the method of airtight fermentation not only does not lose fertilizer efficiency but also improves it. For example, after the Xiaodongzhuang Management Area of the Xinli Village Commune in Tianjin adopted the method of mud-sealed fertilizer accumulation, the crops in the fields where this fertilizer was applied grew well, there were fewer diseases and pests, fewer fly maggots, and fewer sick people. This further proves the benefits of adopting this measure.

It inevitably takes more effort to carry out airtight fermentation when accumulating fertilizer, but if arranged well, the contradiction can also be resolved by increasing fertilizer efficiency. Can labor be appropriately arranged? The Qiujiazhuang Production Team of the Boli People's Commune in Jiaonan County, Shandong, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, has a fertilizer accumulation and hygiene committee specifically in charge of fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing and hygiene work, and has established a professional fertilizer accumulation team to implement contracted responsibility and has set out methods for public and private fertilizer use. They issue fertilizer tickets according to the quality of the fertilizer accumulated by each household and also evaluate the work points of the fertilizer accumulation personnel. This not only did not increase labor tensions but also ensured that year-round fertilizer accumulation was managed by dedicated personnel, resulting in more and better fertilizer, and also cultivated hygienic habits and maintained the regularity of hygiene campaigns. This has enabled the contradiction between fertilizer accumulation and hygiene in terms of labor to be rationally resolved under the overall goal of ensuring increased agricultural production.

    在积肥过程中，把人畜粪便和垃圾、污水等收集起来，经过封闭发酵等处理，既能杀灭寄生虫卵和病菌，消灭农作物的病虫害和草籽，又能提高肥效，真是一举两得的好事！
    以寄生虫卵和病菌为例，在未经发酵的粪便垃圾等污物中，往往含量很多，随时都有混入饮水、蔬菜和瓜果等饮食物中再侵入人体的可能，有的还可以通过皮肤侵入体内，对健康造成很大威胁。北京市对粪便等曾作过蛔虫卵和病菌指数的检查，一克粪干中有细菌四亿三千二百万个，蛔虫卵一千二百三十二个；一克稀粪内有细菌一千七百万个，蛔虫卵九百六十个。而寄生虫的种类很多，为害更大的还有钩虫、条虫和血吸虫等，都是随粪便排出虫卵的。伤寒、痢疾等病害也主要是通过患者粪便来传播的。但是粪便垃圾等污物的量很大，无害化处理的一种简便办法就是密闭发酵。据试验，泥封堆肥等发酵的温度可以高达摄氏七十度，而这些虫卵和细菌的耐热程度，顶高的也经不起连续几十小时的六十五度的高温。并且，密封发酵还可提高肥效。
    从目前的情况看，无论是南方有些地方所采取的粪池密闭发酵的办法，或北方有些地方所采取的泥封堆肥和泥封积肥的办法，都比露天沤肥办法的肥效高。北京市卫生防疫站曾对采用三种不同处理方法所积肥料的肥效作过化验分析，一克晒的粪干含氮0.15％，磷1.96％，钾0.76％；而经粪池发酵的稀粪和泥封堆肥的肥料，含氮量都要高的多，含磷和钾的量如以纯粪折合计算也要高些。如一克稀粪含氮0.95％，磷0.73％，钾0.59％；一克堆肥（粪便和垃圾为1∶5的比例）含氮0.30％，磷0.58％，钾0.48％，可见，密封发酵的办法，不但不会损失肥效，倒还提高了肥效。如天津新立村公社小东庄管理区采取了泥封积肥的办法以后，上这种肥的田庄稼长得好，病虫害少、蝇蛆少，有病的人也少。这更证明采取这种措施的好处。
    在积肥时搞密封发酵，总不免要多费些工夫，但安排的好，矛盾也可以通过提高肥效统一起来。能不能对劳力适当安排呢？山东胶南县泊里人民公社丘家庄生产队，在党支部的统一领导下，有个积肥卫生委员会，专门管积肥造肥和卫生工作，并成立了积肥专业队伍，实行包干负责，定出了公私用肥的办法，对各户积收的肥料，按质量发给肥料票，也评定了积肥人员的工分。不但没有增加劳动力的紧张，还使常年积肥有了专人管理，积的肥料又多又好，还养成了卫生习惯，保持卫生运动的经常性。这就使积肥和卫生在劳力上的矛盾，在保证农业增产的总目标下得到了合理的解决。
