　　Observations on Land Reform in Cuba
　　By Our Correspondent Kong Mai
    Land reform is developing rapidly in Pinar del Río Province, the tobacco-rich region of western Cuba. The peasants who participated in the million-strong Havana rally have powerfully promoted the development of land reform after returning. In the province's first and fourth districts, hundreds of peasants come every day to demand land or to resolve land disputes, and the atmosphere is full of fighting spirit.
    In recent days, your correspondent, along with Betancourt, an agricultural engineer and representative of the National Land Reform Committee stationed in the fourth district, visited newly established cooperatives in Guane, Mantua, Los Arroyos, Cortés, and other places in the southern part of the province, and witnessed the vivid face of Cuban peasants carrying out land reform.
    Betancourt told us that the large estate owners' 40,000 caballerías of land in the fourth district will be distributed. The peasants are welcoming the distribution of land with victorious sentiments. Juan, a peasant in Mantua, told the reporter, "I have eight children, but not a single piece of land. All the peasants present are the same as me, and now have no work. We only have two months of work a year, and we have to work fourteen hours a day, but only get one and a half pesos in wages. We have been fighting for land all along." At the same time, the battle cry to defend land reform is being echoed everywhere. At a meeting, a young man riding on the shoulders of his companions said to his companions: "We are working here to let all those who suffer like us get land, bread, and peace. If the Batista elements and foreign interventionists dare to set foot on Cuban soil, we will chop off their heads." Everyone applauded and shouted: "Implement land reform!" "Defend land reform!"
    In this area, we also saw the urban people supporting land reform, donating more than eighty tractors to this area, turning up waves of yellow soil day and night on the vast virgin land covered with palm trees, emitting the fragrance of the soil.
    One of the characteristics of land reform in this area is the coordinated development of agriculture, social reform (primarily social welfare), and tourism. Due to the expropriation of large tracts of wasteland belonging to large estate owners and corrupt officials of the dictatorial government, the situation of land and forest wasteland has been significantly changed. The peasants are building water conservancy projects on a large scale. In Martinita of La Gal Cortés, we met more than one hundred young people who were building a dam one and a half kilometers long on the reclaimed estate land. These young men's enthusiasm for labor has increased even more after returning from attending the July 26th Havana Conference. In the past month alone, more than one hundred reservoirs, large and small, have been built in the fourth district alone. A seventeen-kilometer highway is being built on the 1,900 caballerías of land occupied by Batista's son and the large estate owner Baronas. The newly built highway leads to Cape Corrientes at the southern end of the province, in order to facilitate the transportation of agricultural products from the cooperative and the tourism of foreign tourists.
    In Guane, a children's hospital has also been established. Many poor farmers' children suffering from schistosomiasis have already been hospitalized for treatment. A school that can accommodate more than two hundred farmers' children is under construction.
    Peasants are organizing cooperatives one after another to develop agriculture. Pancho, the chairman of a recently organized cooperative, told me that his cooperative has forty caballerías of land and eighty households. The cooperative will grow onions. When we asked him why he planted onions, he replied: "Cuba has to import millions of dollars of American onions every year. Why should we send money to our number one enemy for buying what can be produced on Cuban soil? We don't want to rely on the United States for a living. We hope to produce onions first, without importing, and then find ways to export them in the second step."
    The main thing is to develop tobacco production. In San Juan and Martinez de Tona, about 10,000 farmers will get land, and they will greatly increase tobacco production. Captain Núñez Jiménez, Director of the National Land Reform Committee, is currently inspecting there. The staff of the National Land Reform Committee's office in this area are studying and solving the complex land problems arising from the characteristics of local tobacco cultivation. Engineer Jacinto, head of the Tobacco Department of the National Land Reform Committee, said that seven cooperatives have been organized in this area, with a total of 300 farm households. The number of cooperatives will reach fifteen this year. The National Land Reform Committee will appoint representatives as inspectors of the cooperatives to ensure tobacco production. The articles of association of the cooperatives have not yet been determined, and will be formulated gradually in practice based on accumulated experience. He also said that the office of the National Land Reform Committee in the district receives requests from farmers to organize tobacco cooperatives every day.
    According to Engineer Jacinto, the US-funded Cuban Land and Tobacco Company in the San Juan district, with more than 3,000 workers, is the largest company in Cuba and belongs to the American Tobacco Company of the United States. This American company occupies 84 caballerías of the best land, produces the famous golden tobacco, and has extremely high profits. According to the provisions of the Land Reform Law, the land belonging to the company is transferred to the company's seventy-six Cuban shareholders, but the management of the company is still the same as before. Specific measures for determining the price of tobacco products and the distribution of cooperative income are currently being negotiated.
    In the recently organized Pancho Pedro Tobacco Cooperative near San Juan, the construction of new business units designed by the revolutionary army technicians is vigorously underway. The plans and models we saw a month ago at the agricultural, animal husbandry, and industrial exhibition at the University of Havana are now becoming reality on the former land of the large estate owners. Soon, more than two hundred and sixty families will live and work in the new cooperative. In fact, they will be agricultural workers employed by state-run tobacco farms.
    On the way back, we saw some unemployed agricultural workers in the villages. They know that the Land Reform Law will give them land rights. But they are waiting for the arrival of the staff of the National Land Reform Committee. They said that due to the lack of cadres of the National Land Reform Committee, some places have not yet started when land reform is rapidly carried out in other places.
    Due to the constant counterattacks by the Cuban government, the Revolutionary Army, and the Cuban people, the open clamor of large estate owners and foreign forces to sabotage land reform is no longer as rampant as before. The sabotage of large estate owners and counter-revolutionary elements is being carried out more covertly. Some landlords have infiltrated the cooperatives. Since seeing that land reform is an inevitable trend and the prospects for developing the national economy through land reform, many small and medium-sized landlords have changed their attitudes. Their doubts and fears about land reform have also been greatly reduced. The rumors spread by American journalists that land reform is disrupting social order are unfounded. (Attached picture)

### 古巴土改见闻

　　古巴土改见闻
　　本报记者　孔迈
    土地改革在古巴西部盛产烟草的比那尔德里奥省迅速发展。参加哈瓦那百万人大会的农民回去后，有力地推动了土地改革的开展。这个省的第一和第四区每天都有数以百计的农民来要求土地或要求解决土地纠纷，到处充满着战斗的气息。
    这几天来，记者同土地改革全国委员会驻第四区的代表、农学工程师贝坦科尔特在瓜纳、曼图亚、洛斯阿罗约斯、科尔特斯和该省南部的其它地方新近建立的合作社里访问，亲眼见到古巴农民进行土地改革的生动面貌。
    贝坦科尔特对我们说，大庄园主在第四区的四万卡瓦耶里亚的土地将进行分配。农民们以胜利的心情迎接土地的分配。曼图亚的农民胡安对记者说，“我有八个孩子，可是没有一点土地。所有在场的农民都和我一样，现在没有工作。我们一年只有两个月有工作，每天要劳动十四小时，但只得到一个半比索的工资。我们一直在为土地而斗争。”同时，保卫土改的战斗号召，也到处得到响应。在一次会上，一个骑在他的同伴们肩膀上的青年对他的同伴们说：“我们在这里工作是为了让所有像我们一样的受苦人得到土地、面包和和平。如果巴蒂斯塔分子和外国干涉者胆敢踏上古巴的土地，我们就砍掉他们的脑袋。”大家都鼓掌高呼：“实行土地改革！”“保卫土地改革！”
    在这个地区里，我们也看到了城市人民支援土改，捐给这个地区的八十多台拖拉机，夜以继日地在复盖着棕榈树的广阔的处女地上翻起黄土的浪花，发出泥土的清香。
    这个地区土地改革的特点之一，是协调一致地同时发展农业、社会改革（首先是社会福利）和游览业。由于大庄园主和独裁政府贪官污吏的大片荒废的土地被剥夺，土地和森林荒废的情况已有了显著的改变。农民们在大修水利。在拉加尔科尔特斯的马尔蒂尼塔斯，我们会见了在收回的大庄园土地上修筑一个长一公里半的水库的一百多位青年。这些小伙子在参加7月26日哈瓦那大会回来之后，劳动热情更加高涨。最近一个月当中，仅仅第四区就修建了大小一百多个水库。在巴蒂斯塔的儿子和大庄园主巴罗纳斯占据的一千九百卡瓦耶里亚的土地上，正在修筑一条十七公里的公路。新建的公路通向该省南端的科连特斯角，以便利合作社的农产品运输和外国游客的游览。
    在瓜纳，还建立了一所儿童医院。很多患血吸虫病的贫苦农民的孩子已经住院治疗。一所能容二百多农民子弟的学校正在修造。
    农民们纷纷组织合作社，发展农业。有一个最近组织起来的合作社的主席潘乔对我说，他的合作社有四十卡瓦耶里亚土地，八十户人家。合作社将种植洋葱。我们问他为什么种洋葱时，他回答说：“古巴每年要进口数百万美元的美国洋葱。我们为什么要因为购买古巴土地上能够生产的东西而把钱送给我们的头号敌人呢？我们不愿意指靠美国生活。我们希望首先生产洋葱，不要进口，第二步再设法出口。”
    主要的是发展烟草生产。在圣胡安和马丁内斯德托纳，约有一万个农户将得到土地，他们将大大增加烟草生产。土地改革全国委员会主任努涅斯·希门尼斯上尉目前正在那儿巡视。土地改革全国委员会在这个地区的办公室人员，正在研究解决由于当地种植烟草的特点而产生的复杂的土地问题。土地改革全国委员会烟草部负责人哈辛托工程师说，这个地区已经组织了七个合作社，共三百家农户。合作社的数目今年将达到十五个。土地改革全国委员会将委任代表作为合作社的监察员，以保证烟草生产。合作社章程还没有确定，这将在实践过程中根据积累的经验逐步制订。他又说，土地改革全国委员会在该区的办公室每天都收到农民组织烟草合作社的请求。
    据哈辛托工程师说，圣胡安区拥有三千多工人的美资古巴土地和烟叶公司，是古巴最大的一家公司，属于美国的美国烟草公司。这家美国公司占有八十四卡瓦耶里亚最好的土地，生产著名的金黄烟草，利润极高。根据土地改革法的规定，属于公司的土地转给该公司的七十六个古巴股东，但公司的管理还是同以前一样。关于确定烟草产品价格和合作社收入分配的具体措施，现在正进行协商。
    在最近组织的靠近圣胡安的潘乔·佩德罗烟草合作社里，革命军技术人员设计的新事业单位的建设正在大力进行。一个月前我们在哈瓦那大学的农牧业、工业展览会上看到的计划和模型现在正在大庄园主从前的土地上变为现实。不久以后，将有二百六十多个家庭生活和工作在新的合作社里。实际上，他们将是国家经营管理的烟草农场雇佣的农业工人。
    在回来的时候，我们在村镇上看到了一些失业的农业工人。他们知道，土地改革法将会给他们土地权。但是他们正在盼望土地改革全国委员会工作人员的到来。他们说，由于土地改革全国委员会的干部不够，因而当另一些地方土地改革迅速开展的时候，有些地方还没有开始。
    由于遭到古巴政府、革命军和古巴人民的不断反击，大庄园主和外国势力公开破坏土改的叫嚷已经不像以前那么嚣张了。大庄园主和反革命分子的破坏进行得更加隐蔽了。有些地主渗入了合作社。自从看到土地改革是必然的趋势以及土地改革为发展国民经济展开的前景后，许多中小地主改变了态度。他们对土地改革的怀疑和恐惧也大大减少了。美国记者竭力散布的所谓土地改革使社会秩序紊乱的谣言，是没有根据的。（附图片）
