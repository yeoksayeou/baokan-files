    Several New Types of Paint

    Perchlorovinyl Paint
    Perchlorovinyl paint is made from perchlorovinyl resin as the main raw material. This type of paint has strong resistance to mineral acids and many chemical reagents, making it a most suitable anti-corrosion material for chemical factories.

    High-Grade Insulating Varnish
    Insulating varnish is conventionally divided into five grades, with some grades able to withstand high temperatures of 150 to 180 degrees Celsius. The manufacturing method for this type of varnish is relatively difficult, and in the past, we relied on imports. Now, our country has successfully trial-produced polyester heat-resistant enameled wire varnish. We have also successfully trial-produced silicone insulating varnish and high-grade enameled wire using polyvinyl formal as the raw material.

    Organic Titanium Resin Paint
    Titanium is a metallic element. Butyl titanate is a type of organic compound with titanium as its center. Organic titanium resin paint can withstand high temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius and can withstand drastic changes in rapid heating and cooling. High-temperature heated parts of machinery and equipment, such as the exhaust equipment of internal combustion engines, can last a long time when coated with organic titanium paint. (Zishan)

    几种新型的油漆
    过氯乙烯漆
    过氯乙烯漆是用过氯乙烯树脂作为主要原料配制成的。这种漆对于矿酸和很多化学药品的抵抗力很强，是一种最适合于化学工厂用的防腐蚀材料。
    高级绝缘漆
    绝缘漆，在习惯上分成五个等级，有的等级能耐摄氏一百五十到一百八十度的高温。这种漆的制造方法比较困难，过去都是依靠进口，现在，我国已经试制成功聚酯耐热漆包线漆。还试制成功了有机硅绝缘漆和用聚乙烯醇缩甲醛作为原料的高度漆包线。
    有机钛树脂漆
    钛是一种金属元素。钛酸丁酯，是以钛为中心而生成的有机化合物的一种。有机钛树脂漆能耐摄氏五百度的高温，并能经得起骤热骤冷的激剧变化。机器设备的高温受热部分，如内燃机的排气设备，涂了有机钛漆，可以经久不坏。（滋善）
