Xinhua News Agency Report:

The Eighth Company of a People's Liberation Army unit, stationed in Shanghai and responsible for guarding the city, has been stationed on Nanjing Road in Shanghai for over three years. Although this location is the most prosperous and bustling area of Shanghai, the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company have consistently maintained the excellent tradition of hard work and plain living of the People's Army.

Soldier Yang Guangpin is the "model" in this regard for the entire company. Every year when new uniforms are issued and old uniforms are turned in, the clothes he hands over are always in good condition, without even a worn spot, while he himself wears shirts that have been mended many times. There were several times when he was going to throw away one particular shirt, but each time, he turned it over and looked at it, and felt that as long as it was patched, it could still be worn for a few more days, so he never threw it away. Yang Guangpin used to work as a blacksmith at home when he was a child, and also learned masonry from his father; he knows how working people live. He knows that although the country is richer now than in the past, we must still live frugally in prosperous times as if we were poor, and save as much as we can. When the washbasin in the company broke, he didn't let anyone take it to the street to be repaired, but found a piece of scrap iron from the garbage heap and spent two lunch breaks replacing the "new" bottom of the old washbasin. Later, Yang Guangpin was transferred to the cooking squad as a cook. When the higher authorities called for saving coal, he thought: If I could come up with a good way to save coal, I would be contributing to supporting Shanghai's industry. He pondered day and night, and finally came up with a way to convert the forced-air stove into a suction-air stove, saving the company a lot of coal.

The mops used by the company to wipe the floors are made by themselves from waste products; they are very economical with water and electricity, saving more than twenty yuan in water and electricity bills every month. The soldiers also don't spend much of their pocket money. Every month when their allowances are issued, they either send it home or deposit it in the bank. Soldier Huang Changgen, in nineteen months, spent only seven yuan and sixty cents, apart from buying a pen and a sweater. He doesn't smoke or buy candy, and sends his accumulated money home. He uses the remaining money to buy books, and has already bought a complete set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

The company's cadres are role models for the soldiers in this regard. Instructor Liu Renfu and Deputy Company Commander Zhang Jibao each spend no more than two yuan of pocket money each month. Although Company Commander Liu Yumin smokes, he doesn't spend more than four yuan a month. The cadres never gather together to eat and drink; everyone is very frugal in their eating, clothing, and use of resources. Deputy Company Commander Zhang Jibao's sneakers, which have been patched with layers of leather and cloth, are still being worn.

The Eighth Company's officers and soldiers maintain the spirit of hard work and plain living day after day, which is the result of the Party's regular education. The company's leadership and Party branch emphasize maintaining and carrying forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle of our army, and the ideological work is done very meticulously. They also often educate all the officers and soldiers to learn from the glorious revolutionary struggle tradition of the Shanghai people. They learn from the Shanghai working class's revolutionary drive in building a new Shanghai, and avoid being tainted by the habits of extravagance and showing off wealth left over from the old society. All of these provide great education to the soldiers.

In the Eighth Company's club, there is a Lost and Found Exhibition Cabinet, which fully demonstrates the communist virtue of the Eighth Company's comrades in not pocketing found items. Since being stationed in the urban area, the Eighth Company's officers and soldiers have turned in lost items a total of 310 times, including more than ninety yuan in cash, fifty-four pens, and more than fifty other items. Many items have been returned to their owners, and those that have not been found are temporarily displayed in the exhibition cabinet.

The Eighth Company's officers and soldiers' excellent style has been praised by the people, who call them the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road."

### 艰苦朴素作风不减当年  驻上海南京路八连受到群众称赞

    艰苦朴素作风不减当年
    驻上海南京路八连受到群众称赞
    据新华社讯　警卫上海的人民解放军某部八连，在上海市南京路上住了三年多了。他们住的这个地方，虽然是上海最繁华、最热闹的地方，但是八连官兵仍然一直保持着人民军队艰苦朴素的优良传统。
    士兵杨光品，在这方面是全连的“标兵”。每年发新军衣交旧军衣的时候，他上交的衣服都是好好的，连个磨破的地方都没有，自己却穿着几经修补的衬衫。那件衬衫，本来有几次要扔掉了，但是每一次，他翻过来看看，调过去瞧瞧，就觉得只要补一下还能穿些日子，结果几次也没扔掉。杨光品小时候在家打过铁，还跟父亲学过瓦匠活，他知道劳动人民怎样过日子。他知道，现在国家比过去富了，但是富日子还要当穷日子过，能多节省一点就多节省一点。连里的洗脸盆破了，他不让拿到街上去修，自己从垃圾堆里找了块废铁片，用了两个午睡的时间，将旧脸盆换上了“新”底。后来杨光品调到炊事班当炊事员，赶上上级号召节约用煤，他想：如果能想出个节约用煤的好办法来，自己对支援上海工业也算出了一把力。他日夜琢磨，终于想了一个办法，将鼓风灶改成了吸风灶，为连里节省了不少用煤。
    连里擦地板用的拖把，是他们自己利用废品作的；用水和用电都很节省，每月节约水电费二十多元。战士们零用钱也不多花，每月津贴费一发下来，不是寄回家去，就是存到银行里。士兵黄长根，在十九个月里，除了买钢笔和毛衣以外，只花了七元六角零用钱。他不抽烟，也不买糖吃，把积存的钱寄回家里。剩下的钱买些书，“毛泽东选集”就已经买齐了。
    连队干部在这方面处处是战士们的榜样。指导员刘仁福和副连长张继宝，每人每月零用钱都不超过两元。连长刘裕民虽然会抽烟，每月也用不到四元。干部们从来没有凑在一块吃吃喝喝过，大家吃、穿、用都很俭省。副连长张继宝的那双球鞋，上面已经缝补了层层皮子和布，也还在穿着。
    八连官兵保持艰苦朴素作风三年如一日，是党的经常教育的结果。连的领导和党支部十分强调保持和发扬我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，思想工作做得很细致。他们还经常教育全连官兵学习上海人民光荣的革命斗争传统。学习上海工人阶级建设新上海的革命干劲，而不要沾染那些旧社会遗留下来的讲排场、摆阔气的习气。这些都给战士们很大的教育。
    在八连的俱乐部里，有一个拾物展览柜，它充分显示出八连同志拾金不昧的共产主义品德。自从进驻市区以来，八连官兵拾物交公的共有三百一十人次，其中有钱九十多元，钢笔五十四支，其他物品五十多件。许多东西已经找到失主，没找到失主的便暂时陈列到展览柜来。
    八连官兵的这种优良作风，受到了人民的称赞，称他们是“南京路上的好八连”。（附图片）
