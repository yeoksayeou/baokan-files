Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: It was announced here today that Phạm Văn Đồng, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on August 8th to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. The contents are as follows:

　　In my letters to the two chairmen on February 4th, March 4th, May 18th, and June 1st, 1959, I have repeatedly reminded the two chairmen of the increasingly deepened interference of U.S. imperialism in Laos, the serious violation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and the attempt to turn Laos into a U.S. military base in order to prepare for a war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Since then, the U.S. government and the Phoui Sananikone government have not only not stopped but have also more seriously and blatantly violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos. As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot but be particularly concerned about the situation in Laos and pay attention to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to directly and seriously threaten the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　U.S. imperialism is shipping more and more new military personnel and weapons into Laos, establishing many military bases, airports, and strategic highways in Laos. The Phoui Sananikone government is increasingly frantically persecuting personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the Laotian people who love their country and peace, slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and provoking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　In order to legalize the U.S. military personnel and weapons shipped into Laos, the Government of the Kingdom of Laos, under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, reached an agreement with the Government of the French Republic on the use of U.S. military personnel to train the army of the Kingdom of Laos, with the aim of further strengthening the armed forces of the Kingdom of Laos. This action by the U.S. imperialists, the Phoui Sananikone government, and the French government seriously violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos. This is a new step in the overall plan of U.S. imperialism to further interfere in Laos, provoke a civil war in Laos, and seize command of the Laotian army in order to turn Laos into a U.S. military base, drag Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc, and prepare for a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　More seriously, on July 28, 1959, the Sananikone government, using the conflict they launched with the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units as an excuse, concentrated troops in the area of the Vietnam-Laos border and arrested Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. In order to divert world public opinion from their actions, the Sananikone government has continuously and blatantly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of Laos.

　　The current extremely serious situation in Laos directly threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and threatens peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again reminds the two chairmen of the above situation and requests the two chairmen to take urgent measures to restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and to guarantee peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: It was announced here today that Phạm Văn Đồng, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on August 8th to the Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, requesting him to take urgent measures to restore the activities of the Laotian International Commission, to stop the civil war in Laos, to stabilize the situation in Laos, and to guarantee peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　In the letter, Foreign Minister Phạm Văn Đồng said that following my letters to you on January 19th, February 23rd, May 17th, and June 1st, 1959, I now once again solemnly remind you of the current serious situation in Laos.

　　The letter said that in order to realize the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, the Sananikone government is concentrating troops in the Vietnam-Laos border area, arresting Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and launching a propaganda offensive against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In order to divert world public opinion from their actions, the Sananikone government blatantly slanders the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of Laos.

　　The letter pointed out that the above actions of U.S. imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government have more seriously violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the agreements signed between the Government of the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, making the situation in Laos extremely serious.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: It was announced here today that Phạm Văn Đồng, Premier and Foreign Minister of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram on August 8th to Indian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru, reminding him of the extremely serious current situation in Laos.

　　The telegram said that the Laotian Phoui Sananikone government has taken another step forward in realizing the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. The Sananikone government has increased troops to the Laos-Vietnam border. It arrested Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and launched a propaganda offensive against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Sananikone government has also brazenly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Laos.

　　The telegram pointed out that the above actions of U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government once again more seriously violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the various agreements signed between the Government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, creating an extremely dangerous situation in Laos, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and endangering peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    范文同向日内瓦会议两位主席等发出函电
    美国干涉老挝局势威胁越南安全
    应当采取紧急措施制止老挝内战
    据新华社河内11日电　这里今天公布了越南民主共和国政府外交部长范文同在8月8日写给1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席——苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的信。内容如下：
    在1959年2月4日、3月4日、5月18日、6月1日给两位主席的信中，我曾经多次提醒两位主席注意美帝国主义日益加深对老挝的干涉、严重破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议、企图把老挝变成美国的军事基地，以便准备发动反对越南民主共和国的战争的情况。从那时以来，美国政府和培·萨纳尼空政府不但没有停止、而且更加严重和明目张胆地违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议。作为签订日内瓦协议的一方和老挝王国的邻国，越南民主共和国政府不能不特别关心老挝的局势，并注视着美帝国主义直接和严重地威胁越南民主共和国的阴谋。
    美帝国主义向老挝运进越来越多的新的军事人员和武器，在老挝建立了许多军事基地、飞机场和战略公路。培·萨纳尼空政府越来越猖狂地迫害前寮国战斗部队人员和爱祖国、爱和平的老挝人民，诬蔑越南民主共和国和向越南民主共和国挑衅。
    为了使运进老挝的美国军事人员和武器合法化，老挝王国政府在美帝国主义的压力下，同法兰西共和国政府就使用美国军事人员训练老挝王国军队问题达成了协议，目的在于进一步加强老挝王国的武装力量。美帝国主义者、培·萨纳尼空政府和法国政府的这种行动严重地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议。这是美帝国主义进一步干涉老挝、挑起老挝内战、掌握老挝军队的指挥权，以便把老挝变成美国的军事基地，把老挝拉入侵略性的东南亚条约组织军事集团，准备在印度支那和东南亚发动新的战争的总计划中的一个新的步骤。
    更加严重的是，1959年7月28日萨纳尼空政府以他们发动的、同前寮国战斗部队之间的冲突作为借口，在越南—老挝边界一带集中兵力，逮捕苏发努冯亲王和前寮国战斗部队的其他领导人。萨纳尼空政府为了转移世界舆论对他们的行动的注意，他们接连不断地、明目张胆地诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝的内政。
    老挝当前极其严重的局势直接威胁到越南民主共和国的安全，威胁到印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    越南民主共和国政府再一次提醒两位主席注意上述情况，并要求两位主席采取紧急措施，使老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复活动，使关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到严格的履行，使印度支那和东南亚的和平获得保障。
    据新华社河内11日电　这里今天公布，越南民主共和国外交部长范文同8月8日写信给老挝国际监察和监督委员会主席，要求他采取紧急措施，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，制止老挝的内战，稳定老挝的局势，保证印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    范文同外交部长在信中说，继1959年1月19日、2月23日、5月17日和6月1日我写信给您之后，现在，我再一次郑重地提醒您注意老挝当前严重的局势。
    信中说，为了实现美帝国主义的阴谋，萨纳尼空政府正在越南—老挝边境一带调集兵力，逮捕苏发努冯亲王和前寮国战斗部队的其他领导人，对越南民主共和国展开宣传攻势。为了转移世界舆论对他们的行动的注意，萨纳尼空政府明目张胆地诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝的内政。
    信中指出，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府上述行动已更加严重地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，使老挝的局势变得极其严重。
    新华社河内11日电　此间今天公布：越南民主共和国政府总理兼外交部长范文同8月8日打电报给印度共和国总理兼外交部长尼赫鲁，提醒他注意极其严重的老挝当前局势。
    电报说，老挝培·萨纳尼空政府在实现美帝国主义的阴谋方面又前进了一步。萨纳尼空政府已经增调军队到老挝—越南边境。它逮捕了苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人，并且开展了反对越南民主共和国的宣传攻势。萨纳尼空政府还悍然诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝王国的内政。
    电报指出，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府的上述行为再一次更加严重地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议，制造了极其危险的老挝局势，威胁着越南民主共和国的安全和使印度支那与东南亚的和平遭到危险。
    电报说，越南民主共和国政府希望尼赫鲁总理和印度政府以自己的影响和作为印度支那国际监察和监督委员会主席国的名义，采取紧急措施，恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议能得到严格和充分的履行，以维护印度支那和东南亚的和平。
