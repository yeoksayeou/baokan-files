    New Soviet Scientific and Technological Achievements
    Tubeless Television
    A "Sputnik-2" tubeless television set has been manufactured by a certain Moscow university. Its vacuum tubes have been replaced by a very small semiconductor instrument. This television consumes very little power, and only a 12-volt battery is enough. This television is particularly economical. For example, a "Sputnik-2" television set consumes only 13.2 watts, while the most economical television set currently mass-produced in the Soviet Union consumes 105 watts. The "Sputnik-2" weighs just over 7 kilograms, while the lightest mass-produced television set weighs 16 kilograms.
    The new television is equipped with a 200x150 cm fluorescent screen and has the same sensitivity as an ordinary television. The "Sputnik-2" television is easy to carry and suitable for use in field rest stops and during travel.
    According to the designers, tubeless television has great prospects and will be widely used. Promoting this type of television can save a lot of electricity and materials. In addition, this television has excellent performance because semiconductor instruments have a much longer life than vacuum tubes, with a service life measured in tens of thousands of hours.
    New Method for Treating Hypertension
    An unusual method for treating hypertension has been successfully researched by Alexander Obrosov, a famous physiologist in Moscow.
    As is known to all, hypertension is mainly caused by the destruction of nerve processes in the end brain. This scholar discovered that low-power electromagnetic oscillation pulses have a beneficial effect on the nervous system. Therefore, Obrosov decided to use radar principles to treat hypertension. Under his guidance, a special device was manufactured. It can emit ultra-high frequency pulses with a power of less than five kilowatts. Pulses emitted to the patient's celiac plexus can normalize the function of the central nervous system, thereby reducing hypertension. After only ten to twelve treatments for hypertensive patients, their nerves will be greatly improved. Several hundred people have already been treated with the electromagnetic oscillation method. According to observations made on these patients over the past two to three years, the new method of treating hypertension has a lasting effect.
    Currently, scholars are improving this new method. Their aim is to use the principles of radar to treat other diseases caused by damage to the central nervous system.
    "Medical Radar"
    A new type of ultrasonic device that can quickly detect cancerous tumors in the human body has been designed in the Soviet Union. Doctors call it "medical radar." This device emits ultrasonic pulses that bounce back when they encounter stubborn cancer tissue, and the image of the tumor is clearly displayed on the fluorescent screen. "Medical radar" can detect tumors as small as one millimeter. It is of great use in diagnosing cancer and can help doctors detect this serious disease early for more effective prevention and treatment.
    Improving Cotton Fiber Quality
    Uzbek textile workers have created a method to improve the quality of cotton fiber. Khadzhim Usmanov, a researcher at the Tashkent Institute of Polymer Chemistry of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences, said: "Cotton can be improved in quality and obtain new properties after being treated with special chemical agents. The improved fiber looks very much like wool fiber and can be used to make bright and beautiful fabrics. The main feature of the new cotton fiber is its high strength. It is resistant to sunlight, can withstand high temperatures of over 160 degrees, and is resistant to acid and alkali corrosion. In addition to cotton fiber, cotton yarn, ribbons, fabrics, and sewn clothes can be dyed with chemical agents."
    New Metal Smelting Method
    Scientists in the Kazakh Republic have created a fundamentally different smelting method. This method may cause a revolution in metallurgy.
    The new smelting method is as follows: hot air is pressed into a cylindrical rotary smelting furnace at an extremely high speed, forming a vortex. At this time, fuel and pulverized smelting materials are sent into the vortex. The smelting material is subjected to centrifugal force and thrown towards the wall of the smelting furnace, where it is immediately melted by the rapidly rotating hot gas.
    According to Kanesh Satbayev, President of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences, this rotary smelting furnace can simultaneously carry out the processes of heating, melting, and volatilization of volatile metals. In this way, when refining ores containing a variety of metals, all valuable components can be extracted from the ore.
    Scientists say that using the rotary method to smelt ferrous metals also has excellent results. This method can be used to directly make steel from iron ore without going through blast furnace smelting.

    苏联科学技术新事
    没有电子管的电视机
    莫斯科某大学制造出“卫星—2”牌无电子管电视机，它的电子管是由一个很小的半导体仪器所代替。这种电视机耗电量小，只有一个十二伏特的蓄电池就够了。这种电视机特别经济。例如，一台“卫星—2”电视机只耗电十三点二瓦特，而苏联现在成批生产的最经济的电视机也要耗电一百零五瓦特。“卫星—2”重量只有七公斤多点，而大量生产的最轻的电视机也有十六公斤重。
    新电视机装有200×150厘米的萤光屏，灵敏度和普通电视机一样。这种“卫星—2”牌电视机携带方便，适合田间休息站和旅行时使用。
    据设计人员说，无电子管电视机很有前途，将得到广泛利用。推广这种电视机可以节省大量电力和材料。此外，这种电视机的使用性能很好，因为半导体仪器比电子管寿命长得多，它的使用期限数以几万小时计。
    治高血压的新方法
    一种与众不同的高血压治疗法由莫斯科著名的生理学家亚历山大·奥布罗索夫研究成功。
    大家知道，患高血压的原因，主要是末脑神经过程受到破坏的缘故。这位学者发现，功率不大的电磁振荡脉冲对于神经系统起着有益的作用。因此，奥布罗索夫决定利用雷达学原理来治疗高血压。在他的指导下，制成了一个专门的装置。它可以发射出超高频率的脉冲，其功率在五瓩以下。发射到病人腹腔丛方面的脉冲可以使中枢神经系统的功能正常化，从而使高血压得到降低。只要对高血压病人进行十次到十二次治疗，他的神经就会大大好转。已经有好几百人用电磁振荡法治疗。根据两三年来对这些病人所做的观察，用新法治疗高血压，效果很持久。
    目前，学者们正在改进这项新方法。他们的目的是利用雷达原理医治因中枢神经系统的损伤而引起的其他疾病。
    “医学雷达”
    一种能够迅速发现人体内的癌瘤的新式超声波装置已经由苏联设计成功。医生们都管它叫做“医学雷达”。这种装置能放出超声波脉冲，脉冲遇到顽硬的癌组织反射回来，萤光屏上便清楚地映出肿瘤的影像。“医学雷达”可以发现小到一毫米的肿瘤。它在诊断癌的时候有很大用途，能帮助医生及早地发现这种严重的疾病，以便进行更有效地防治。
    改良棉花纤维品质
    乌兹别克纺织工作者创造了改良棉花纤维品质的方法。乌兹别克共和国科学院塔什干聚合物化学研究所研究员哈吉姆·乌斯曼诺夫说：“棉花用特种化学药剂处理后，品质可以得到改良，并且获得新的性能。经过改良的纤维外观很像羊毛纤维，可以用它制成光亮而美观的布匹。新的棉花纤维的主要特点是高度牢固。它不怕日晒，能经得住一百六十多度的高温，不怕酸碱的侵蚀。除棉花纤维外，棉纱、纱带、布匹和缝好的衣服都可以用化学药剂浸染。”
    新的金属熔炼法
    哈萨克共和国的科学家们创造了一种原则上与众不同的熔炼法。这种方法可能在冶金方面引起一场革命。
    新的熔炼法是这样的：以极快的速度把热风压入圆柱形的回转熔炼桶，形成涡流。这时把燃料和经过粉碎的熔炼材料送进涡流。熔炼材料受离心力作用，被抛向熔炼桶壁，在那里遇到迅速旋转着的炽热的气体立刻熔化。
    据哈萨克共和国科学院院长卡内什·萨特巴耶夫说，这种回转熔炼炉可以使挥发性金属的烧热、熔炼、挥发等过程同时进行。这样一来，在精炼含有多种金属的矿石时，就可以把所有的贵重成分从矿石里提取出来。
    据科学家们说，用旋转法来熔炼黑色金属，效果也很好，用这种方法可以从铁矿石直接炼钢，不必经过高炉熔炼。
