On the Issue of Planned and Proportionate Development of the National Economy

Discussions by the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Other Units

The Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Renmin University of China, and Peking University jointly held a discussion in Beijing on the issue of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. The main issues raised in the papers and speeches at the meeting were:

I. Understanding and Expression of the Law of Planned and Proportionate Development of the National Economy

The first opinion: The law of planned and proportionate development should be changed to the law of planned development. The reasons are: ① Proportionate development is a common law of all societies; ② The law of planned development itself does not raise the issue of proportionate development, but only requires the implementation of unified planning leadership. The two cannot be confused.

The second opinion: Although proportionate development is a common law of all societies, it is expressed as planned and proportionate development under socialism. Therefore, it cannot be divided into two laws. However, the "proportionate" after "planned" should not be put in parentheses.

The third opinion: Proportionate development is not a common law of all societies. Needing a certain proportion is not equal to proportionate development. The law of proportionate development is unique to socialism. Planned development and proportionate development are inseparable. Without proportionate development, planned development has no content. Violating the unified plan will inevitably violate the objective requirements of proportionate development. Therefore, the law of planned and proportionate development can be called the law of planned development or the law of proportionate development, but it cannot be divided into two laws.

II. The Law of Proportionate Development and the Law of Reproduction

The first opinion: Proportionate development is the general law of social reproduction. Some people believe that the reason why the national economy requires proportionate development is because of the social division of labor. Exchanges must be carried out between various departments. If certain proportions are not followed, the realization and compensation of various parts of social products will encounter difficulties, and reproduction cannot proceed normally.

The second opinion: That various departments must have certain proportions is the general law of reproduction common to all societies, but it is not the law of proportionate development. Because the former does not reflect the essence of production relations and does not answer how production must develop, while the latter indicates the direction in which the economy proceeds under certain production relations. Proportionate development is not a law of social reproduction but a law unique to socialism.

III. The Law of Planned Development and the Law of Value

Some people believe that the results of these two laws are consistent in many cases in terms of allocating labor and means of production in different departments. However, there are contradictions between the two, because the planned law regulates the allocation of labor and means of production among different departments, reflecting its objective requirements from the perspective of whether the entire economy can develop at a high speed and proportionally; while the law of value reflects its objective requirements from the perspective of the partial interests of each production department or enterprise, that is, whether it can offset expenditures with income, exchange at equal value, and smoothly carry out reproduction.

IV. The Issue of Development Speed

There are several opinions on the meaning of high speed. The first opinion: High speed has three different meanings when viewed from three different perspectives: one is a speed higher than that of capitalist countries; the second is a speed higher than that of other socialist countries; and the third is an extraordinary speed achieved by maximizing possibilities. It is more appropriate to view high speed from the second and third perspectives. The second opinion: The meaning of high speed: one is a speed higher than that of capitalism; the second is a speed achieved after fully utilizing objective possibilities. When talking about the inevitability of high-speed development in socialism, the high speed referred to is the former. When talking about the relationship between high speed and proportionate development, the high speed referred to is the latter. The third opinion: A speed higher (some say much higher) than that of capitalism is high speed. Because we generally refer to the high speed of the socialist economy, there is no need to compare it with various countries in the socialist camp and different periods of our own country.

Regarding the trend of speed changes, some people believe that not only the entire economy, but also any department, cannot grow exponentially every year. Generally speaking, when the base is small, it is possible to double it with some effort. After the base becomes large, it is generally not easy to double it. Some people believe that production can only move forward in a wave-like manner. That is, from a time perspective, it is often high one year and low the next; from a spatial perspective, it is often high in one region and low in another. But the overall trend is still high speed. Some people also believe that the Great Leap Forward is advancing in a wave-like manner and cannot rise in a straight line. When the productive forces are in a stage of quantitative change, it is possible to develop with an expanding increase in the annual amount. During local qualitative changes, it is possible for the speed to increase year by year. Comparing this quantitative change stage with the qualitative change stage, the average growth rate must be increasing. From a fairly long period of time, the average growth rate is increasing compared from one period to another.

Regarding the factors determining speed, some people believe that the most fundamental factor determining speed is the productive forces that function under certain production relations.

Some people believe that there are two factors determining speed: one is the existing material and technical level (that is, the level of development of productive forces); the other is production relations. The promotion of production speed by advanced production relations is reflected in: changes in people's mental outlook; the creation of social conditions for fully developing and utilizing various forces; and the exertion of people's subjective initiative.

V. The Main Proportions in the National Economy and Their Interrelationships

The first opinion: The main proportion is the proportion between the two major categories.

The second opinion: The main proportion is the proportion between the two major categories and the proportion between accumulation and consumption.

The third opinion: In the proportion of material production, from the perspective of the principle of reproduction, the two major categories are the most basic proportion. However, in the specific situation of our country, the two major categories are mainly composed of industry and agriculture. Therefore, in a certain period, the proportion of industry and agriculture can become a most critical proportion. The main proportion in terms of distribution is the proportion between accumulation and consumption. In each period, the proportion of accumulation and consumption basically depends on the proportion of production centered on the proportion of industry and agriculture, but it actively affects the scale, composition, and speed of reproduction.

VI. The Relationship Between Speed and Proportion

The first opinion: The relationship between the two is that the proportion should adapt to the speed, and the speed should be restricted by the proportion. A similar statement is: The proportion must obey the speed, and the speed must comply with objective proportions.

The second opinion: The two have a relationship of contradictory unity. They have both interconnected and mutually restrictive aspects, and mutually contradictory aspects, and can be transformed under certain conditions. Of course, this transformation never means that speed can be transformed into proportion, or proportion can be transformed into speed. The form of transformation is the transformation of the main aspect of the contradiction. Speed is usually the main aspect of the contradiction, but under certain conditions, proportion can also be transformed into the main aspect of the contradiction.

The third opinion: Speed and proportion are not in a relationship of contradictory unity. Because the high speed of the entire national economy must be premised on proportionate development. Those who advocate contradictions are the result of confusing the excessive speed of individual departments with the high speed of the entire national economy. Some people believe that speed (purpose) and proportion (means) only produce contradictions when people make mistakes. Some people say: The imbalance caused by high speed can be explained in two ways: one is the contradiction between the old proportion and the new proportion, and the other is the contradiction between high speed and low speed. It is not the contradiction between high speed and proportionate development.

Discussions by the Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Economic Society and Other Units

The Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Economic Society held a discussion on the issue of "Planned and Proportionate Development of the National Economy" on July 15. More than 150 people from 33 relevant economic organizations, economic research institutions, schools, and financial and economic business departments in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City participated in the meeting.

The main issues discussed included the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy and the speed of economic development. Regarding the first issue, some comrades believe that the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy arose as the opposite of the laws of competition and production anarchy under the capitalist system. When Stalin put forward the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, he used parentheses to indicate that planned development meant proportionate development. The overall meaning of this law only refers to the planned development of the national economy. Some comrades believe that two opinions are worth studying: (1) The requirement of social production to develop in a certain proportion according to Marx (general law) cannot be confused with the law of planned and proportionate development. Capitalist society also requires proportionality, but it achieves a certain proportion through fluctuations, disproportions, and production crises. Only under socialist conditions is it possible and necessary to develop in a planned and proportionate manner. (2) It is inappropriate to divide planned and proportionate development into two laws. Planned development requires unified leadership, and proportionate development requires the various departments of the national economy to develop in proportion. Proportionate development is the content of planning. Therefore, planned and proportionate development is a unified whole. Some comrades said: The proportion of expanded reproduction in capitalism is not the same as the proportionate development of general social production. Because strictly adhering to the law of proportionate development of general social production will not bring about abnormal social production, while the law of proportionate development of expanded reproduction in capitalism will cause economic crises.

Regarding the issue of economic development speed: It is generally believed that high speed is mainly compared with capitalist countries. For example, some people said that from 1950 to 1958, comparing the industrial production development speed of socialist countries and capitalist countries, socialist countries increased by an average of 160%, while capitalist countries only increased by 37%. They disagreed with the statement that high speed only refers to the rate of production growth exceeding the rate of population growth, believing that this cannot explain the true meaning of high speed. For example, in France, industrial production increased by 8.5% in 1957 compared to 1956, and the population increased by 0.64%. Obviously, the industrial production growth rate has exceeded the population growth rate. Can it be said that industrial growth is high speed? Obviously, it cannot be said that. Another opinion believes that high speed is the highest speed of production in human society, and at the same time, the social conditions at that time must be estimated: for example, the production of wheat in the first five-year plan increased by 10%. Since there were no machines at that time, it can be said to be high speed, but after the implementation of mechanization, if it increases by 10% again, it may not be high speed. A third opinion believes that high speed is definitely compared with capitalist countries. But in addition to this, comparisons should also be made between the speed of various economic sectors and various enterprises.

    关于国民经济有计划按比例发展问题
    中国科学院经济研究所等单位的讨论
    中国科学院经济研究所、中国人民大学、北京大学三个单位不久前在北京联合召开了关于国民经济有计划按比例发展问题的讨论，在会上所提出的论文和发言中涉及的主要问题是：
    一、对国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的理解和表述
    第一种意见：有计划按比例发展规律应改为有计划发展规律。原因是：①按比例是各个社会共有的规律；②有计划发展规律本身不提出按比例问题，只是要求实行统一的计划领导，两者不能混同。
    第二种意见：按比例虽然是各个社会共有的规律，但它在社会主义下表现为有计划按比例发展。因此，不能把它分成两个规律。但也不应将有计划后面的按比例加上括号。
    第三种意见：按比例不是所有社会共有的规律，需要一定的比例并不等于是按比例，按比例发展规律是社会主义特有的规律。有计划与按比例是不可分割的，离开了按比例，有计划就没有内容；违反了统一计划，必然同时违反按比例的客观要求。因此，可以将有计划按比例发展规律叫做有计划发展规律，或叫做按比例发展规律，但不能分成两个规律。
    二、按比例发展规律与再生产规律
    第一种意见：按比例是社会再生产的一般规律。有人认为：国民经济之所以要求按比例发展，是由于有社会分工，各部门之间必须进行交换，不遵守一定的比例，社会产品各部分的实现和补偿就会遇到困难，再生产便不能正常进行。
    第二种意见：各部门要有一定的比例是各社会共有的再生产一般规律，但它并不是按比例发展规律。因为前者不反映生产关系的本质，没有回答生产必须怎样发展，而后者则表明在一定生产关系下经济按什么方向进行。按比例发展不是社会再生产的规律，而是社会主义特有的规律。
    三、有计划发展规律与价值规律
    有人认为：在不同部门分配劳动和生产资料方面，这两个规律作用的结果，在许多情况下是一致的。但两者有矛盾，因为计划规律调节劳动和生产资料在不同部门间的分配，是从整个经济能否是高速度按比例发展的角度反映其客观要求的；而价值规律则是从各生产部门或企业的局部利益，即能否以收抵支、等价交换并顺利进行再生产的角度反映其客观要求的。
    四、发展速度问题
    关于高速度的含义有几种意见。第一种意见：高速度从三种不同的角度来看，有三种不同的含义：一是比资本主义国家高的速度；二是比其他社会主义国家高的速度；三是尽最大可能而达到的异乎寻常的速度。从第二第三种角度来看高速度是比较适当的。第二种意见：高速度的含义：一是比资本主义高的速度；二是充分利用客观可能性后达到的速度。当谈到社会主义高速度发展的必然性时，所指的高速度就是前者。当谈到高速度与按比例的关系时，所指的高速度就是后者。第三种意见：比资本主义高（有的说高得多）的速度就是高速度。因为我们一般所指的是社会主义经济的高速度，所以没有必要与社会主义阵营各国及本国不同时期进行比较。
    关于速度变动的趋势问题，有的人认为：不仅整个经济，就是任何一个部门，也不能每年成倍地增长，一般说来，基数小的时候，经过一定努力是能够成倍地增加的。基数大了以后，一般地说就不易加倍了。有的人认为：生产只能是波浪式的前进。即从时间上看，常常是这一年高，另一年低；从空间上看，常常是这一地区高，另一地区低。但就总的趋势看仍是高速度。有人还认为：跃进是按照波浪式前进的，不能直线上升。在生产力处于量变阶段时，年度之间以扩大的增长额发展是可能的。在局部质变的时候，可能出现年度之间速度递增的现象。以这个量变阶段同发生质变阶段比较，平均增长率一定是递增的。从一个相当长的时期来看，一个时期和另一个时期相比，平均增长速度是递增的。
    关于决定速度的因素问题，有人认为，决定速度最基本的因素是在一定生产关系下起作用的生产力。
    有人则认为决定速度的因素有二：一是现有的物质技术水平（即生产力发展水平）；一是生产关系。先进生产关系对生产速度的推动作用表现在：人的精神面貌的改变；创造了充分发挥和利用各种力量的社会条件；人的主观能动性的发挥。
    五、国民经济中的主要比例及其相互关系
    第一种意见：主要比例是两大部类的比例。
    第二种意见：主要比例是两大部类及积累与消费的比例。
    第三种意见是：在物质生产比例中，从再生产原理来说，两大部类是最基本的比例。但在我国具体情况下，两大部类主要是由工农业所构成的。因此，在一定时期内，工农业比例可以成为一个最关键性的比例。分配方面的主要比例是积累和消费的比例。在每个时期积累和消费的比例基本上取决于以工农业比例为中心的生产比例，但它又积极影响着再生产的规模、构成和速度。
    六、速度和比例的关系
    第一种意见：二者之间的关系是比例要适应速度，速度要受比例的制约。与此相近的提法是：比例必须服从速度，速度要遵守客观比例。
    第二种意见是：二者是矛盾统一的关系。它们既有相互联系、相互制约的一面，又有相互矛盾的一面，而且在一定条件下可以转化。当然，这种转化决不意味着速度能转化成比例，比例能转化成速度，转化的形式是矛盾主要方面的转化。速度通常是矛盾的主要方面，但在一定条件下比例也会转化为矛盾的主要方面。
    第三种意见：速度和比例不是矛盾统一的关系。因为整个国民经济高速度必须以按比例为前提。主张有矛盾的人是由于把个别部门的过高速度与整个国民经济高速度混在一起的结果。有人认为：速度（目的）和比例（手段），只是在人们犯错误时才会产生矛盾。有人说：速度快引起的失调可作两种解释：一是旧比例与新比例的矛盾，一是高速度与低速度的矛盾。它不是高速度与按比例的矛盾。
    南京经济学会筹备委员会等单位的讨论
    南京经济学会筹委会于7月15日举行了关于“国民经济有计划按比例发展”问题的讨论会。参加会议的有江苏省和南京市有关的经济机关、经济研究机构、学校和财经业务部门等三十三个单位一百五十多人。
    讨论的主要问题有国民经济有计划按比例发展规律和经济发展速度等。关于第一个问题，有的同志认为：国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律是作为资本主义制度下竞争和生产无政府状态的规律的对立物而产生的。斯大林提出国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的规律时，用括弧来表明有计划发展就是按比例发展的意思。这一规律的总意义只是指国民经济有计划的发展。有的同志则认为，有两种意见值得研究：（1）不能把马克思的社会生产要求按一定比例的说法（一般规律）同有计划按比例发展规律混淆起来。资本主义社会也要求按比例只是它通过波动、比例失调、生产危机等过程才达到一定比例。只有在社会主义条件下才有可能和必要有计划地按比例地发展。（2）把有计划按比例分为两个规律是不妥当的。有计划是要统一领导，按比例是要国民经济各部门按比例发展，按比例是计划的内容。因此，有计划和按比例是统一的整体。有的同志说：资本主义扩大再生产的比例和一般社会生产按比例发展又不是一回事。因为严格遵守一般社会生产按比例发展的规律不会带来社会生产不正常的现象，而资本主义扩大再生产的比例发展规律，却会引起经济危机。
    关于经济发展的速度问题：普遍认为高速度主要是与资本主义国家比较的。如有人说，1950年到1958年，以社会主义国家和资本主义国家的工业生产发展速度比较来说，社会主义国家平均增长了160％，而资本主义国家只增长了37％。他们不同意高速度只是指生产的增长速度超过人口增长速度的说法，认为这不能说明高速度的真意。如法国1957年比1956年工业生产增长8.5％，人口增长0.64％，显然，工业生产增长速度已超过了人口增长速度，这能说工业增长是高速度么？显然是不能这样说的。另一种意见认为：高速度是人类社会生产的最高速度，同时得估计到当时社会条件：如第一个五年计划小麦生产增长10％，由于当时没有机器，这就可以说是高速度的，但实行了机械化后，如果再增长10％，就不一定是高速度了。第三种意见认为，高速度与资本主义国家相比是肯定的。但除此以外，还应从各个经济部门，各个企业之间的速度来作比较。
