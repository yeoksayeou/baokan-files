Guarantee Workers' Study Time, Continuously Solve Specific Difficulties
Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Mill Creates a Learning Climax

    (Our newspaper Zhengzhou, August 9th) Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Mill has adopted various measures to ensure and stimulate workers' participation in spare-time cultural studies. At present, the attendance rate of study has reached more than 95% of the total number of employees in the factory, and more than 5,000 employees are involved in an increasingly high learning upsurge.

    When the factory established a spare-time cultural school last September, the study attendance rate was only about 5%. In particular, production experts, grassroots party and youth league backbone members were overwhelmed by social activities and meetings, which encroached upon their study time. Workers also neglected cultural learning due to too many evening meetings and various ideological problems. At that time, there was a phenomenon that the labor attendance rate and the study attendance rate were quite different. The factory Party Committee and the branches in each workshop seriously studied this issue and decided to improve the teaching quality of teachers, integrate the learning content with production, and do everything possible to ensure the workers' cultural learning time.

    The Party Committee arranged and stipulated the study time in accordance with the factory's production plan. It required that each workshop should not change or adjust the time unless there were major accidents, otherwise, it must be approved by the Party Committee. During the study time, shift production units should not casually transfer activists to attend meetings or engage in other activities. During the May Day holiday, when all the employees of the factory were in a tense situation in production and social activities, they never missed cultural lessons. When each workshop encountered social activities and general meetings that conflicted with learning, they proposed to give way to learning and attend classes first. The factory Party Committee believed that it was necessary to make a determination to persist. In particular, the factory launched a campaign to "reduce unnecessary meetings, shorten meeting time, and ensure cultural learning," which reduced the number of meetings in the factory by half. The Party, Youth League, and Trade Union activities on Fridays generally do not exceed one and a half hours. This not only ensures that employees can attend classes on time, but also has ample time to review their lessons. In order to ensure the continuous improvement of the study attendance rate, each workshop has also formulated a set of study attendance system, such as: roll call for class, approval for leave, timely submission of homework, registration of unexcused absences, etc.

    The most important thing is that they have adopted in-depth and meticulous mass line teaching methods such as investigation and research, specific analysis, and individual tutoring, so that workers who were originally unwilling to study have also become active learners. More than 100 cultural classes in the factory have established "Attendance Investigation Teams" and "Teacher Tutoring Teams." They go deep into dormitories and workshops to widely understand the reasons why workers do not participate in learning. A worker in the Preparation Workshop was unwilling to participate in learning. Teacher Liu Cunchang learned through family visits that the reasons why he was unwilling to participate in learning were: first, he was not in a good mood due to discord with his lover, and second, he had no confidence. After the workshop party organization helped him solve his family disputes and ideological problems, Liu Cunchang conducted specific tutoring at his home, and now he has become an outstanding student. Female worker Zhang Lingdi has never participated in cultural learning. This time, she was inspired by the teachers' in-depth and specific mobilization work and participated in learning. In May, she was rated as one of the outstanding students in the factory. In order to consolidate the learning results and prevent some workers from dropping out midway because they could not keep up with the class, the teachers also took measures to go deep into the dormitories, workshops, and places where the workers went to understand various difficult problems, conduct individual tutoring, and put forward: "Where there is learning, the teacher goes there, and answers questions anytime and anywhere." The party organizations of each workshop attach great importance to the teachers' work and give them ample time for individual tutoring. Therefore, from September last year to now, very few workers in the factory have been found to have dropped out midway due to learning difficulties.

    Another way to improve the study attendance rate is to make up lessons. In the past, some workers had to occupy study time due to various reasons, such as: illness, childbirth, participation in voluntary labor, important meetings of grassroots cadres, etc. When they missed the study, no one made up the lessons, they could not keep up with the class, which weakened their learning enthusiasm and led to dropping out midway. Now, whoever is missing will be given make-up lessons. The methods of making up lessons are also flexible and diverse. One is to concentrate on making up lessons at the teacher's home on Sundays; the other is to make up lessons individually. When class starts, the teacher goes half an hour early to teach the absentee first; or the absentees are gathered together to make up lessons during several noon times, so that the absentees can keep up with the class. In order to facilitate make-up lessons, the party organizations of each workshop take the cultural class as a unit when transferring workers to participate in short-term voluntary labor, so as to facilitate collective make-up lessons or equip teachers to accompany them.

    Now, there are very few workers in the No. 3 Cotton Mill who are absent from class for no reason or drop out for other reasons, and an unprecedented learning upsurge has been set off throughout the factory. Workers participating in voluntary labor carry textbooks with them and read whenever they have time. Students can complete their homework on time or ahead of schedule.

### 保证职工学习时间　不断解决具体困难  郑州国棉三厂掀起学习高潮

    保证职工学习时间　不断解决具体困难
    郑州国棉三厂掀起学习高潮
    本报郑州9日讯　郑州国棉三厂采取各种办法保证和激发工人参加业余文化学习。目前学习出席率已占全厂职工人数的95％以上，五千多名职工卷入越来越高的学习热潮。
    去年9月，这个厂成立业余文化学校时，学习出席率只达5％左右，特别是生产能手、基层党、团员骨干分子，社会活动和会议太多，侵占了他们的学习时间。工人们也因晚上会议太多和种种思想问题轻视文化学习。当时出现了劳动出勤率和学习出席率相距很大的现象。工厂党委会和各车间支部认真的研究了这个问题，决定除提高教员讲课质量、学习内容要和生产相结合，并决定千方百计保证工人的文化学习时间。
    党委会根据全厂生产计划统一安排规定了学习时间，要求各个车间没有特大的事故，不准更改调动时间，否则，必须由党委会批准。学习时间内，轮班生产单位，不能随便抽调积极分子开会和搞其他活动。五一节的时候，全厂职工在生产和社会活动都比较紧张的情况下，始终没缺过文化课，各车间遇有社会活动和一般会议与学习发生矛盾，提出给学习让路，首先上课，工厂党委认为：坚持下去要下决心。特别是全厂开展了“减少不必要的会议，缩短开会时间，保证文化学习”运动，使全厂会议减少了二分之一，礼拜五的党、团和工会活动，一般不超过一个半小时。这样不仅保证职工能按时上课，而且有了较充裕的时间复习功课。为了保证学习出席率不断提高，各车间还制定了一套学习考勤制度，如：上下课点名，请假批准，按时交作业，无故旷课登记等。
    最重要的是他们采取了调查研究，具体分析，个别辅导等深入细致的群众路线的教学方法，使原来不愿学习的工人，也成了学习积极分子。全厂一百多个文化班，都成立了“出席调查小组”、“教师辅导小组”。他们深入宿舍、车间、广泛了解工人不参加学习的原因。准备车间有个工人不愿参加学习，教师刘存长通过家庭访问，了解他不愿参加学习的原因，一是和爱人闹不和，情绪不高，二是没有信心。车间党组织帮助他解决了家庭纠葛和思想问题后，又由刘存长在他家具体进行辅导，现在他成了优秀生。女工张令娣，一向不参加文化学习，这次，被教师们深入具体的动员工作激发起来，参加了学习，5月份，她被评为全厂优秀生之一。为了巩固学习成绩，不使一些工人因跟不上班而中途辍学，教师们还采取深入宿舍、车间和工人们所到的地方，了解各种疑难问题，进行个别辅导，提出：“学习在那里，教师到那里，做到随时随地解答问题。”各车间党组织非常重视教师们的这个工作，给他们充分的时间，作个别辅导。因此，从去年9月到现在，全厂就很少发现因学习困难跟不上班、而中途退学的工人。
    使学习出席率提高的另一个办法是补课。过去，有些工人确因种种原因不得不占用学习时间，如：生病、生孩子、参加义务劳动，基层干部的重要会议等。耽误了学习，没有人补课，跟不上班，减弱了学习情绪，以致中途退学。现在谁缺给谁补。补课方式也灵活多样，一种是礼拜天集中在教师家中补；一种是个别补，上课时，教员早去半小时，先给缺课者上课；或者把缺课者集中一起利用几个中午时间补课，使缺课者能够跟班上课。各车间党组织，为了照顾补课方便，在抽调工人参加短期义务劳动时，都以文化班为单位，便于集体补课，或配备教师随往。
    现在，国棉三厂无故旷课或因其他原因退学的工人已经很少，而且全厂掀起从没有过的学习高潮。参加义务劳动的工人都带着课本，有空就读，学生的作业，都能按时或提早做完。
