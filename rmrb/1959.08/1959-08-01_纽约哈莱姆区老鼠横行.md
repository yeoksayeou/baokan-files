    Rat Infestation in Harlem, New York

    A New York "Amsterdam News," published in Harlem (the Black district), ran an article with the large headline "Harlem Infested with Rats," stating that it is estimated that there are now more than nine million rats in the city, with almost two rat bite incidents occurring every day. However, the municipal authorities ignore this situation. Sometimes the courts summon landlords to fine them and let the matter drop. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    纽约哈莱姆区老鼠横行
    纽约哈莱姆区（黑人区）出版的“阿姆斯特丹新闻”以大字标题“哈莱姆老鼠横行”发表的文章说，据估计市内的老鼠现已超过九百万只，每天几乎发生两起以上老鼠咬伤人事件。然而市政当局不理睬这种情况。有时法院将房主传去罚些款了事。（据新华社）
