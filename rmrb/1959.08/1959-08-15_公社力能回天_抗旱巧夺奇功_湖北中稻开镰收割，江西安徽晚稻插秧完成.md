Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 14th: Hubei Province has begun harvesting medium rice in most areas, and the province-wide medium rice harvesting work is about to be fully launched. Farmers in various places are welcoming the major victory in the fight against drought with joy.

Hubei Province has a large area of medium rice with high yields, and it is the most important grain crop in the province. This year, more than 14 million mu of medium rice have generally achieved reasonable close planting, with sufficient base fertilizer and good growth. However, during the critical period of heading and grain filling for medium rice, a continuous drought of more than a month occurred, and the drought-affected area of medium rice reached more than 9 million mu. In order to overcome the drought and ensure a bumper harvest, the masses and cadres in the medium rice producing areas of the province rose up to fight the drought. Regardless of the heat, they searched for water sources day and night, built dams to block rivers, and used waterwheels to irrigate the fields. In late July, the Yuanquan Commune in Jingshan County organized thousands of people to build 100 river dams on the Jingshan River, which flows through the commune, in four days and four nights, and set up hundreds of dragon-bone waterwheels to divert the river water to the cracked rice fields, saving more than 20,000 mu of medium rice. The Yandun Commune in Jingmen County had more than 3,000 of its 4,000 ponds and weirs dried up, and irrigation water was extremely scarce. However, the members of this commune were not discouraged. They selected a group of cadres and experienced farmers to cross mountains and ridges, search for more than 80 new water sources day and night, and opened more than 1,000 ditches along these new water sources, and erected more than 1,300 waterwheels to divert water over several hills to irrigate the drought-affected rice fields, overcoming the drought and winning a bumper harvest.

Because the people's communes have a large population and great strength, various places have also transferred a large number of personnel during the intense drought resistance struggle to strengthen field management work such as pest control and topdressing. Many counties in the Xiaogan area have generally carried out one or two pest control operations for medium rice; Huanggang, Yichang and other areas have accumulated tens of millions of dan of miscellaneous fertilizers during the drought resistance, meeting the needs of late-stage topdressing for medium rice.

At present, Hubei Province is continuing to fight the drought to win a bumper harvest of late rice and cotton while arranging labor to harvest medium rice, ensuring careful harvesting and threshing, and returning every grain to the home.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 14th: Jiangxi Province has successfully completed late rice transplanting in the fight against drought. More than 12 million mu of late rice have been transplanted throughout the province, of which the area of continuous cropping of late rice has expanded by more than 1.2 million mu compared with last year.

At the beginning of the summer harvest and planting season this year, various places in Jiangxi Province put forward the slogan of "Striving for late rice to surpass early rice, and ensuring autumn harvest to surpass summer harvest," and adopted the method of harvesting and planting simultaneously to advance the transplanting of late rice seedlings. The transplanting time of late rice in the province was generally half a month earlier than last year.

During the late rice transplanting period, droughts occurred successively in various places, and many late rice fields were affected by the lack of rain, which affected the progress of transplanting. However, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the people of the province exerted their energy and immediately launched a vigorous drought resistance and rush planting campaign. The Yuanjing Brigade of Gaoping Commune in Linchuan County, where the drought was more serious, transferred more than 100 young and middle-aged people to form 33 drought resistance commando teams, who fought day and night in the fields. They adopted the method of pumping water, turning the fields, and transplanting rice seedlings at the same time, and rushed to transplant nearly 100 mu of late rice in four days. In order to speed up the progress of drought resistance and rush planting, Duchang, Ruichang, De'an, Yongxiu, Wuning and other counties in Jiujiang Prefecture, which were severely affected by drought, established command organizations from top to bottom. Within a week, the entire prefecture pumped water to fight drought and rush-planted more than 250,000 mu of late rice. The Zingtian Commune in Le'an County, Fuzhou Prefecture, after two days of intensive work, repaired more than 70 reservoirs, weirs, and canals, allowing more than 3,000 mu of late rice fields that could not be transplanted due to lack of water to be quickly transplanted with seedlings. The Chating Commune in Lichuan County expanded the area of double-cropping late rice transplanting by more than 200 mu due to the newly built canals.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 14th: After fighting against the drought, the people of Anhui Province had transplanted 4.3 million mu of double-cropping late rice by the Beginning of Autumn (August 8th), basically ending the rush harvesting and planting work. Now, farmers in various places are strengthening the field management of late rice and striving for a bumper harvest in autumn.

Since June, except for the mountainous areas in southern Anhui and individual areas in northern Anhui where the drought was relatively light, the rainfall in other areas of Anhui Province has been very little, or basically no rain has fallen. Starting in late July, more than 6 million people were mobilized every day throughout the province, using more than 1,600 pumping units, more than 600,000 waterwheels, and other various water lifting tools to vigorously carry out drought resistance and rice transplanting activities, thus ensuring the successful completion of the double-cropping late rice transplanting task. Most of the fields in the Baima Commune in Tongcheng are located in hilly and highland areas. After the commune ranked all the water sources in the commune, it determined that the teams with good water sources should expand the area of late rice as much as possible; the teams with general water sources should strive to achieve the planting plan; the teams with poor water sources should transplant the rice with water, and use ditches and ponds to temporarily hold the seedlings, and then transplant them when there is water. Thanks to these measures, the task of transplanting 14,000 mu of double-cropping late rice was completed four days before the Beginning of Autumn, making it one of the earliest communes in the county to complete the transplanting task. In order to ensure the completion of the transplanting task, the communes also used lake land to transplant more than 100,000 mu of rice near water. The Qilin Commune in Zunyang County is a hilly and lakeside area. The drought in the mountainous areas is serious, and most of the rice fields lack water and cannot be transplanted. The land along the lake is fertile and the water source is good. The commune party committee organized the members in the water-scarce areas to transplant more than 5,000 mu of late rice on the barren lakes, ensuring the completion of the late rice planting plan.

The quality of late rice planting throughout the province this year is better than last year. Generally, late rice fields have been plowed, harrowed, raked, and rolled one to two times, and most fields have implemented close planting of three by six inches.

In the drought resistance and rice transplanting, party committee secretaries at all levels personally directed the battle. Many communes also universally carried out large-scale labor and animal power collaboration in accordance with the principle of equal value exchange. According to incomplete statistics from Tongcheng, Qingyang, and Tongling and other three counties and cities, there are 20 communes, 126 brigades, and 579 teams, mobilizing more than 42,000 people and more than 1,000 cattle to help communes and production teams with insufficient labor to rush transplant more than 30,000 mu of late rice.

　　公社力能回天　抗旱巧夺奇功
　　湖北中稻开镰收割，江西安徽晚稻插秧完成
    据新华社武汉14日电　湖北省大多数地区开镰收割中稻，全省规模的中稻收割工作即将全面铺开。各地农民怀着喜悦的心情，迎接抗旱斗争的重大胜利。
    湖北省中稻面积大，产量高，是全省最主要的粮食作物。今年一千四百多万亩中稻一般都做到合理密植，底肥足，生长良好。但正值中稻扬花灌浆的关键期间，遇上了持续一个多月的干旱，中稻受旱面积达九百多万亩。为了战胜干旱保丰收，全省中稻产区的群众和干部奋起抗旱。他们不顾炎热，不分昼夜地寻找水源，拦河筑坝，车水灌田。京山县源泉公社7月下旬组织了几千人，用四天四夜的时间，在流经这个公社的京山河上拦筑河坝一百处，架起几百条龙骨水车，把河水引到龟裂了的稻田里，抢救中稻二万多亩。荆门县烟墩公社四千多口塘、堰有三千多口车干了，灌溉用水非常缺乏，但是，这个公社的社员们并不气馁，他们选派了一部分干部和老农，翻山越岭、披星戴月地寻找到了八十多处水源，并且沿着这些新水源开了一千多条沟渠，架设了一千三百多部水车，把水引过几个山岗灌到受旱的稻田里去，战胜干旱，赢得丰收。
    由于公社人多力量大，各地在紧张的抗旱斗争中还抽调了大批力量，加强了防虫、追肥等田间管理工作。孝感专区许多县普遍进行了一两次防治中稻虫害的工作；黄冈、宜昌等地区在抗旱中共积杂肥几千万担，满足了中稻后期追肥的需要。
    目前，湖北省各地正在一面继续与干旱搏斗，夺取晚稻、棉花丰收；一面安排劳力抢割中稻，保证细收细打，颗粒归家。
    据新华社南昌14日电　江西省在抗旱斗争中胜利结束晚稻插秧。全省插晚稻一千二百多万亩，其中连作晚稻比去年扩大一百二十多万亩。
    江西省各地今年在夏收夏种刚刚开始时，就提出“力争晚稻超早稻，保证秋收超夏收”的口号，采取边收边种的办法，提前抢插晚稻秧，全省晚稻插秧时间一般都比去年提早了半个月。
    各地在晚稻插秧期间，先后发生干旱，许多晚稻田因为缺少雨水影响了插秧进度。但全省人民在各级党委领导下，鼓足干劲，立即开展了轰轰烈烈的抗旱抢种运动。临川县旱情较严重的高坪公社远景大队，抽调一百多个青壮年组成三十三个抗旱突击队，日夜战斗在田间，他们采取了边车水、边翻田、边栽禾的办法，在四天内就抢插了近百亩晚稻。九江专区受旱严重的都昌、瑞昌、德安、永修、武宁等县，为了加快抗旱抢种进度，从上到下都成立了指挥机构。全专区一个星期内，车水抗旱抢种晚稻二十五万多亩。抚州专区乐安县增田公社，经过两天大突击，修好了水库、水陂、水圳七十多个，使三千多亩因缺水不能插秧的晚稻田迅速插下了秧苗。黎川县茶亭公社由于新修了渠道，使双季晚稻插秧的面积扩大了二百多亩。
    据新华社合肥14日电　安徽省人民经过和干旱作斗争，到立秋（8日）止，已栽插双季晚稻四百三十万亩，基本结束了抢收抢插工作。现在，各地农民正在加强晚稻田间管理，争取秋季丰收。
    从6月份以来，安徽省除皖南山区和淮北个别地区旱情较轻以外，其他地区雨量都很少，或者基本上没有落雨。从7月下旬开始，全省每天出动六百多万人，使用一千六百多台抽水机，六十多万辆水车，以及其他各种提水工具，大力开展抗旱插秧活动，因而保证了双季晚稻栽插任务胜利完成。桐城白马公社大部田地在丘陵和高岗区，公社将全社水源排队以后，确定水源好的队尽量扩大晚稻面积；水源一般的队力保实现栽插计划；水源差的队，除把有水的田栽上晚稻外，还要利用沟、塘寄秧，有水时再移栽。由于采取了这些措施，一万四千亩双季晚稻的插秧任务在立秋前四天就完成了，成为全县完成插秧任务最早的一个公社。为了保证完成插秧任务，各公社还利用湖地就水插秧十多万亩。纵阳县其林公社是个丘陵湖滨地区，靠山岗地带干旱严重，大部分稻田缺水，插不下秧，而沿湖的土地肥沃，水源好，公社党委就组织缺水地区的社员，利用湖荒插晚稻五千多亩，保证完成了晚稻种植计划。
    全省今年种植晚稻的质量都比去年好，一般晚稻田都犁、耙、耖、滚过一至二遍，大部分田实行了三乘六寸密植。
    在抗旱插秧中，各级党委书记都亲自指挥战斗。许多公社还按照等价交换的原则普遍展开了劳力、畜力大协作。据桐城、青阳、铜陵等三个县市的不完全统计，即有二十个公社，一百二十六个大队，五百七十九个小队，发动四万二千多人，耕牛一千多头，帮助劳力不足的公社和生产队，抢栽晚稻三万多亩。
