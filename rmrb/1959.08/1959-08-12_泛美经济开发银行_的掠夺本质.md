　　The Plundering Essence of the "Inter-American Development Bank"
　　Zhang Ye
    The United States and twenty Latin American countries will soon establish an "Inter-American Development Bank." Their representatives reached an agreement on the draft charter of the bank at a meeting held in Washington on April 8, and requested that their respective governments approve it before the end of this year. A preparatory committee composed of representatives from the United States and four Latin American countries will begin work on the establishment of the bank in September this year.
    The establishment of the "Inter-American Development Bank" is a new tactic adopted by U.S. imperialism after its traditional plundering methods of implementing unequal trade policies towards Latin America aroused strong opposition. It is a new tool for U.S. monopoly capital to carry out economic penetration and plunder by taking advantage of the economic difficulties of Latin American countries.
    Originally, it was the long-cherished wish of Latin American countries to establish a financial institution to promote Pan-American economic development, so that they could obtain the funds needed to overcome economic difficulties and develop their own economies under conditions that were slightly more controlled than private investment. As early as the Pan-American Economic Conference held in Rio de Janeiro in November-December 1954, the Chilean representative proposed a plan to establish a Pan-American banking system, with investment from the United States and Latin American countries, to develop the resources of Latin American countries. This plan was supported by many other Latin American countries, but was opposed by the United States. Therefore, although the conference made a decision to organize a committee of experts to study the establishment of the bank and draw up its charter, there was no progress for a long time. Later, at the Inter-American Economic Conference held in Buenos Aires in August-September 1957, some Latin American countries once again proposed the establishment of a Pan-American financial organization, but due to the firm opposition of the United States, only a hollow resolution was passed, suggesting that the "Economic and Social Council of the Organization of American States" establish a special committee composed of representatives of various governments to study how to expand the sources of funds for the economic development of Latin American countries. The reason given by the United States for opposing the establishment of such a bank was that the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other financial institutions controlled by the United States could meet the financial needs of Latin American countries for economic development, and that only U.S. private capital could play an important role in the Latin American economy. This fully exposed the ambition of the United States to insist on using financial organizations under its control to carry out economic expansion in Latin America.
    However, despite the obstruction and opposition of the United States, Latin American countries still actively strived to establish such a bank. The American economic crisis in the autumn of 1957 and the beginning of 1958 severely affected the sales market and prices of Latin America's main export commodities, causing serious economic disasters in these countries. And the United States, which calls itself a "good neighbor" to Latin American countries, not only did not give its southern neighbors any real assistance, but instead took advantage of the situation to intensify the implementation of unequal trade policies of "selling high and buying low" and "selling more and buying less," and deliberately lowered the prices of imported raw materials, and restricted the import quotas of oil and lead and zinc under the pretext of protecting its own industry and commerce, making the economic situation in Latin America even worse. This not only aroused anti-American sentiment among the Latin American people, but also sharpened the contradictions between the ruling groups of Latin American countries seeking economic independence and development and the U.S. monopoly capital attempting to seize more and more profits. Thus, after U.S. Vice President Nixon was beaten during his visit to South America in April-May 1958, Brazilian President Kubitschek proposed a "Pan-American Operation" plan demanding that the United States change its relations with Latin American countries and give these countries economic assistance. The establishment of the "Inter-American Development Bank" is the main content of this "Pan-American Operation" plan in the economic field. This plan required the U.S. government to contribute thirty to eighty billion U.S. dollars to participate in the proposed "Inter-American Development Bank" in order to obtain long-term loans with low interest rates and repayable in local currency under conditions that are slightly easier to control than private investment, to overcome their current economic difficulties and enable the economies of these countries to develop in the next ten years or so. This, to a certain extent, reflects the desire of the national bourgeoisie widely present in Latin America to change the backward economic situation, and has been supported by other Latin American countries. However, this plan itself contains factors that are incompatible with its purpose, and that is dependence on the United States. It is obviously an illusion to try to rely on the plundering and control of Latin American countries by U.S. imperialism to generously help Latin American countries achieve economic independence and development.
    The development of the matter is exactly like this. The United States initially firmly opposed the establishment of the "Inter-American Development Bank," but was later forced to accept the recommendations of the "Pan-American Operation" plan proposed by Kubitschek due to the general rise of the Latin American national independence movement and anti-American sentiment, and agreed to establish the "Inter-American Development Bank." This was in order to intervene and facilitate control, and to use it as a new tool for its plunder of Latin America. At the two meetings of the American "Committee of Twenty-One Nations" held in November-December last year and April-May this year, the United States used its financial pressure to distort and tamper with the Latin American countries' proposal to establish the "Inter-American Development Bank," forcing the representatives of the Latin American countries attending the meeting to pass a plan according to the will of the United States, turning this credit institution into a tool serving the U.S. plundering policy, which is far from the kind of bank that the Latin American countries originally hoped to establish.
    First of all, because the United States will hold 45% of the bank's capital stock (the bank's initial capital is a total of one billion U.S. dollars, of which the United States provides 450 million U.S. dollars), the United States will guarantee its control over the bank through the commercial law of determining each country's voting rights according to the proportion of investment. At the same time, according to the charter, the bank will closely coordinate with the activities of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development manipulated by the United States, and private banks to conduct joint investment in Latin America. The focus of investment will be on plundering Latin America's raw materials and intensifying the intrusion into public utilities and enterprises within the scope of state capitalism in Latin American countries. In this way, the United States has skillfully turned the "Inter-American Development Bank" into a branch of the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
    Second, the "Inter-American Development Bank," with a capital of one billion U.S. dollars, will be divided into two organizations. The first organization is the "Inter-American Development Bank" itself, with funds of 850 million U.S. dollars, which will operate so-called "hard currency development loans." These loans must be repaid in the original borrowed currency and currencies that can be freely exchanged, and are issued under usurious conditions, with an annual interest rate of 5%-5.75%, just like the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The other organization of the bank is the "Special Activities Fund," which was established to appease Latin American countries, with funds of 150 million U.S. dollars. This fund will provide long-term loans with lower interest rates (3%-3.5%), repayable in local currency, for plans such as public works that are not within the scope of general bank loans. However, the final decision-making power for handling these loans belongs to the United States. Obviously, the original goal of Latin American countries to obtain low-interest, "soft currency loans" repayable in local currency from the "Inter-American Development Bank" has not been achieved. At the same time, because the bank is controlled by the United States, Latin American countries are still unable to get rid of the discriminatory policies pursued by the United States in terms of loans.
    Third, according to the bank's charter, the "Inter-American Development Bank" will sell securities to the capitalist world financial market at appropriate times, opening the door for U.S. private capital and, to some extent, international private capital to enter Latin America. In addition, it is also planned to provide insurance for private investment, forcing Latin American countries to undertake conditions such as guaranteeing the free transfer of profits, not confiscating property, and not levying taxes. This is more powerful than anything else in explaining that the reason why the United States initially opposed and finally supported the establishment of the "Inter-American Development Bank" is to create good conditions for U.S. private investment in Latin America, so as to obtain privileges. Everyone knows that U.S. monopoly capital has always regarded private investment as the main means of seizing high profits and plundering raw material sources in Latin America. According to a report in the British "Financial Times" on April 13 this year, by the end of 1957, U.S. private investment in Latin America had reached as high as 8.8 billion U.S. dollars, ranking first among U.S. foreign private investment. Why is the United States so enthusiastic about expanding private investment in Latin America? A United Nations statistic provides the answer: for every dollar invested by U.S. monopoly capital in Latin America, it obtains a profit of 3.7 U.S. dollars; naturally, what is more important is that U.S. monopoly capital will control the economic lifeline of these countries through this investment, and then interfere in their political life and economic development work.
    From the above simple analysis, we can see the plundering essence of the "Inter-American Development Bank." The United States will supplement the work of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the Economic Development Fund, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development through this bank, so as to expand the private investment of U.S. monopoly capital in Latin American countries, in order to further plunder and enslave these countries. However, the process of the emergence of this bank has already made the national bourgeoisie of various Latin American countries realize to a certain extent that it is an illusion to obtain U.S. loans under favorable conditions to solve their economic difficulties and change the backward economic situation. The "Inter-American Development Bank" is, to a certain extent, a product of the increasingly acute relationship between the United States and Latin American countries; however, the future economic aggression activities of this bank will inevitably further deepen the contradictions between the United States and the Latin American people, as well as with the national bourgeoisie of various Latin American countries, thereby arousing a higher anti-American and struggle for national independence in Latin America.

　　“泛美经济开发银行”的掠夺本质
　　章叶
    美国和二十个拉丁美洲国家不久将成立一个“泛美经济开发银行”，它们的代表于4月8日在华盛顿举行的会议上，就这个银行的章程草案取得协议。并要求各国政府在今年年底前予以批准。一个由美国和四个拉丁美洲国家代表组成的筹备委员会将在今年9月开始进行银行的开办工作。
    成立“泛美经济开发银行”，是美帝国主义在它对拉丁美洲执行不平等贸易政策的传统掠夺手法激起强烈的反对后采取的新手段，是美国垄断资本利用拉丁美洲国家的经济困难进行经济渗透和掠夺的新工具。
    原来，建立一个促进泛美经济发展的金融机构，以便在一种比私人投资稍有控制的条件下，使拉丁美洲各国为克服经济困难和发展本国经济取得所需的资金，是这些国家的宿愿。早在1954年11—12月间在里约热内卢举行的泛美经济会议上，智利代表就提出一项计划，建议成立泛美银行体系，由美国和拉丁美洲各国投资，来开发拉丁美洲国家的资源。这项计划得到了其他许多拉丁美洲国家的支持，却遭到了美国的反对。因此，尽管这次会议作出了组织一个专家委员会来就成立这个银行进行研究并定出它的章程的决定，但在一个很长时期内，没有什么进展。后来，在1957年8—9月间在布宜诺斯艾利斯举行的美洲国家经济会议上，一些拉丁美洲国家再度提出建立一个泛美金融组织的建议，也由于美国的坚决反对，只通过了一项空洞的决议，建议“美洲国家组织经济与社会理事会”成立一个由各国政府的代表组成的特别委员会，来研究如何扩大拉丁美洲国家经济发展资金的来源的问题。美国反对成立这样一个银行的理由是，现在美国的进出口银行和由美国控制的国际复兴开发银行等金融机构，能够满足拉丁美洲国家经济发展资金的要求，并且认为只有美国私人资本才能在拉丁美洲经济中起重要作用。这充分暴露了美国坚持要由它控制的金融组织来对拉丁美洲实行经济扩张的野心。
    但是，尽管美国的阻挠和反对，拉丁美洲国家仍然积极争取建立这样一个银行。1957年秋和1958年初的美国经济危机严重地影响了拉丁美洲主要出口商品的销售市场和价格，引起了这些国家严重的经济灾难。而这个自称为拉丁美洲国家“好邻居”的美国，不但不给它的南部邻国以任何真正的援助，反而趁火打劫，加紧实行“贵卖贱买”、“多卖少买”的不平等贸易政策，并故意压低进口原料价格，借口保护本国工商业而限制石油和铅锌的进口额，使拉丁美洲的经济情况更加恶化，这就不仅激起拉丁美洲人民的反美情绪，而且也使要求经济独立发展的拉丁美洲国家统治集团和企图攫取越来越多的利润的美国垄断资本之间的矛盾尖锐化。于是，在1958年4—5月间美国副总统尼克松访问南美挨揍之后，巴西总统库比契克提出一个要求美国改变它对拉丁美洲国家的关系并给这些国家以经济援助的“泛美行动”计划。建立“泛美经济开发银行”就是这个
  “泛美行动”计划在经济方面的主要内容。这个计划要求美国政府拿出三十到八十亿美元来参加拟议中的“泛美经济开发银行”，以便在今后十年左右期间，在一种比私人投资稍易控制的条件下，取得低息的并且可用本国货币偿还的长期贷款，克服它们目前的经济困难并使这些国家的经济得到发展。这个在一定程度上反映拉丁美洲普遍存在的民族资产阶级渴望改变落后的经济状态的要求，得到拉丁美洲其他国家的支持。但是，这个计划的本身包含着同其目的所不能相容的因素，这就是对美国的依赖。要想指靠着掠夺和控制拉丁美洲国家的美帝国主义大发慈悲，帮助拉丁美洲国家达到经济上的独立发展，这显然是一种幻想。
    事情的发展正是这样。美国开始坚决反对建立“泛美经济开发银行”，而后来迫于拉丁美洲民族独立运动和反美情绪普遍高涨的形势，不得不接受库比契克提出的“泛美行动”计划的建议，并同意建立“泛美经济开发银行”。这是为了插手进来，便于控制，并把它作为自己掠夺拉丁美洲的新工具。在去年11—12月和今年4—5月间举行的美洲“二十一国委员会”的两次会议上，美国利用它的财政压力，曲解和篡改拉丁美洲国家提出的成立“泛美经济开发银行”的主张，迫使出席会议的拉丁美洲国家的代表按照美国的意旨，通过把这个信贷机构变成为美国掠夺政策效劳的工具的方案，已经远远不是拉丁美洲国家原来所希望建立的那样的银行了。
    首先，由于美国将占有这家银行股本的45％（银行的创办资本共为十亿美元，其中美国提供四亿五千万美元），美国将通过按投资比例确定每个国家投票权的商业法则，保证它对于这家银行的控制。同时，根据章程，这家银行将与美国进出口银行、由美国操纵的国际复兴开发银行以及私人银行的活动密切配合，对拉丁美洲进行联合投资，投资的重点将放在掠夺拉丁美洲的原料和加紧侵入属于拉丁美洲各国国家资本主义范围内的公用事业和企业。这样美国就很巧妙地把“泛美经济开发银行”实际上变成美国进出口银行和国际复兴开发银行的分行了。
    第二，拥有十亿美元资本的“泛美经济开发银行”将分成两个组织。第一个组织是“泛美经济开发银行”本身，其资金为八亿五千万美元，它将经营所谓“硬币开发贷款”，这些贷款必须以原来所借的货币和能够自由兑换的货币偿还，而且是按照高利贷条件发放的，与美国进出口银行一样，其利息为年息的5％—5.75％。银行的另一个组织是为了敷衍拉丁美洲国家而设立的“特别活动基金”，其资金为一亿五千万美元。这个基金将为不属于一般银行贷款范围之内的公共工程之类的计划提供较低利息的（3％—3.5％），可用本国货币偿还的长期贷款。但是，处理这些贷款最后决定权属于美国。显然，拉丁美洲国家原来希望从“泛美经济开发银行”取得低利的、以本国货币偿还的“软币贷款”的目的并没有达到，同时，由于这家银行被美国所控制，拉丁美洲国家仍然无法摆脱美国在贷款方面所奉行的歧视政策。
    第三，根据银行章程规定，“泛美经济开发银行”将在适当时机向资本主义世界金融市场销售证券，为美国私人资本，同时也在某种程度上为国际私人资本输入拉丁美洲打开方便之门。此外，还计划为私人投资提供保险，迫使拉丁美洲国家承担保证利润自由转移，不没收财产，不抽税等条件。这再有力不过地说明了美国之开始反对而最后支持成立“泛美经济开发银行”，是为美国在拉丁美洲的私人投资创造良好的条件，从而取得特权。大家知道，美国垄断资本一向把私人投资作为在拉丁美洲攫取高额利润和掠夺原料来源的主要手段。据英国“金融时报”今年4月13日报道，到1957年底，美国在拉丁美洲的私人投资已高达八十八亿美元，占美国对外私人投资的第一位。为什么美国这样热中于扩大对拉丁美洲的私人投资呢？联合国的一项统计作了答复：美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲每投一美元，就获得三点七美元的利润；自然，更重要的是，美国垄断资本将通过这种投资控制这些国家的经济命脉，并进而干涉它们的政治生活和经济发展工作。
    从上面的简单分析中，我们可以看到“泛美经济开发银行”的掠夺本质。美国将通过这家银行补充美国进出口银行、经济发展基金和国际复兴开发银行的工作，为美国垄断资本扩大对拉丁美洲国家的私人投资，达到进一步掠夺和奴役这些国家的目的。但是，这家银行的产生经过，已经在一定程度上使得拉丁美洲各国的民族资产阶级认识到，要想在有利的条件下获得美国贷款来解救自己的经济困难和改变落后的经济情况，是一种幻想。“泛美经济开发银行”在一定程度上是美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的关系日益尖锐化的产物；但是，这家银行的未来的经济侵略活动也必然更加加深美国同拉丁美洲人民以及同拉丁美洲各国民族资产阶级之间的矛盾，从而激起拉丁美洲更加高涨的反美和争取民族独立的斗争。（附图片）
