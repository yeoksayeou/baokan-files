　　The representative of the African Youth League Council said at the meeting that African youth should unite with all progressive youth under the slogan of peace and friendship. Although imperialism is still trying every means to persecute and suppress the African people, they have already stood up. African youth will wage unremitting struggles to liberate their countries from imperialist oppression.

　　The speech by the Algerian youth representative was warmly welcomed by the conference. He said that the youth of Algeria have been waging a tenacious battle against imperialist oppression and for national independence, and they are full of confidence in the victory of their struggle.

　　Representatives from Japan and Cyprus condemned the imperialist establishment of military bases in their countries.

　　Argentine representative Piñel pointed out that the struggle of Argentine youth for peace is closely related to the struggle for national independence, self-determination, the withdrawal of military bases, and the cessation of the arms race.

　　At the meeting on the 12th, Liu Xiyuan, head of the Chinese youth delegation, made a speech. Liu Xiyuan expressed his agreement with the two reports made at the meeting by World Federation of Democratic Youth President Bernini and Secretary-General Esiad respectively. Liu Xiyuan pointed out that Chinese youth, like youth from all over the world, love peace and oppose war.

　　Liu Xiyuan then pointed out that Chinese youth wholeheartedly welcome the decision of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States to visit each other.

　　Liu Xiyuan pointed out that Chinese youth firmly support the struggles of the people and youth of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to win and safeguard national independence and to oppose imperialism.

　　Liu Xiyuan expressed his agreement with the slogan of defending youth rights put forward by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. He said that the struggle to defend peace and oppose imperialism and colonialism is also a contribution to the struggle to defend youth rights. Conversely, the struggle to defend youth rights also helps the development of the struggle for peace and national independence.

    非洲青年联盟理事会的代表在会上说，非洲青年要在和平与友谊的口号下同一切进步青年团结起来。帝国主义虽然仍在想尽一切办法迫害和镇压非洲人民，但是他们已经站起来了。非洲青年为了把自己的国家从帝国主义压迫下解放出来，将进行不懈的斗争。
    阿尔及利亚青年代表的发言受到大会的热烈欢迎。他说，阿尔及利亚的青年为了反对帝国主义的压迫、争取民族独立，一直在进行着顽强的战斗，他们对于自己的斗争，充满了必胜的信心。
