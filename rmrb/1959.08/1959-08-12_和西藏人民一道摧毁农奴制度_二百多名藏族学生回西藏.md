　　Destroying the Serf System Together with the Tibetan People
　　Over Two Hundred Tibetan Students Return to Tibet
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th — More than two hundred Tibetan students from the Central Institute for Nationalities set off on the evening of the 10th to return to Tibet and participate in the democratic reform work.
    When the first group of over one hundred Tibetan students from this institute returned to Tibet to work earlier this year, the Tibetan students who remained at the school successively raised requests to return to Tibet to participate in the democratic reforms. This wish has now been realized. At the graduation ceremony, the students expressed one after another that they would definitely not fail the Party's cultivation and the people's expectations, and that they would wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people, and together with the Tibetan people, thoroughly destroy the man-eating serf system and build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.
    This group of students has undergone three to five years of study at the Central Institute for Nationalities and has a certain level of political understanding and considerable cultural knowledge. Many of them come from serf and herdsmen families, and there is a group of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members.
    Before the students decided to return to Tibet, Yang Jingren, Vice-Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, gave them a report on the policy of carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet. The school also held a farewell party, and students of all ethnic groups remaining at the school wrote congratulatory letters and gave souvenirs to them.

　　和西藏人民一道摧毁农奴制度
　　二百多名藏族学生回西藏
    新华社11日讯　中央民族学院的二百多名藏族学生，10日晚启程回西藏参加民主改革工作。
    今年这个学院第一批一百多名藏族学生回西藏工作时，留校的藏族学生就纷纷提出了回西藏参加民主改革的要求，这个愿望现在实现了。在毕业典礼上，学生们纷纷表示决不辜负党的培养和人民的期待，一定要全心全意为西藏人民服务，和西藏人民一起彻底摧毁吃人的农奴制度，建设民主的、社会主义的新西藏。
    这批学生在中央民族学院经过了三年到五年的学习，都有一定的政治认识和相当的文化水平。他们当中有很多人出身于农奴、牧民家庭，并有一批共产党员和共青团员。
    在学生们决定回藏以前，民族事务委员会副主任杨静仁曾向他们作了关于在西藏进行民主改革的政策的报告。学校也举行了送别晚会，留校的各族学生都纷纷给他们写祝贺信、赠送纪念品。
