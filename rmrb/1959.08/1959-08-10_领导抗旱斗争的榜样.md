In all arduous struggles, Party cadres should stand at the forefront and work with the masses to achieve victory. Comrade Luo Chunfu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Jinkou Production Team in the Jinshui Commune, Wuchang County, Hubei Province, has set a brilliant example in this regard through his actions in the fight against drought.

For many years, droughts have frequently harmed the people's production. In the past, when faced with drought, the main method used by farmers was to pray to gods and Buddha, hoping for rain to eliminate the drought. Now, although no one uses this method anymore, the passive "relying on heaven" mentality still exists in the minds of some people. Naturally, the idea of "relying on heaven" is not entirely without reason. For example, when a good harvest is achieved in good weather, it cannot be denied that "heaven" deserves some credit. However, when a prolonged drought strikes, one can no longer simply "rely on heaven" and must take active steps to declare war on the drought and overcome it.

The achievements of the Jinkou Production Team in the fight against drought prove that as long as the broad masses are mobilized and the belief in "man can conquer nature" is established, drought can be completely overcome. Drought, like other difficulties encountered in real life, is also flexible. If people retreat one step from drought, drought may advance two steps towards them. If people advance one step towards drought, drought may be forced to retreat two steps. The key lies in people's attitude towards drought: whether to retreat from it or attack it.

Since "drought" has become a "disaster," overcoming it is by no means an easy task. Taking the Jinkou Production Team as an example, early rice required twelve irrigations, and mid-season rice required three to five irrigations. Just think about how much labor this requires. Under the organization and leadership of Branch Secretary Luo Chunfu, the Jinkou Production Team did this and truly achieved victory in the fight against drought. In this arduous struggle, Comrade Luo Chunfu was able to lead by example, going wherever the difficulties were greatest and working alongside the masses, inspiring their enthusiasm for fighting the drought. At the same time, he was able to pool the wisdom of the masses, widely absorbing their opinions to solve the difficulties encountered in the fight against drought. It is particularly worth mentioning that as the drought worsened, the fight against it became more and more difficult, and ideological problems among the masses also increased. At this time, Comrade Luo Chunfu was still able to promptly resolve the ideological problems of the masses, persevere in the fight against drought, and achieve victory.

Currently, many drought-stricken areas are engaged in the fight against drought. There are many, many cadres like Comrade Luo Chunfu. It is hoped that everyone will be encouraged to work hard, persevere in the fight against drought, and turn the belief that "man can conquer nature" into a solid reality.

    领导抗旱斗争的榜样
    乐于时
    在一切艰巨的斗争中，党的干部都应当站在最前列，和群众一起取得斗争的胜利。湖北武昌县金水公社金口生产队党支部书记罗春甫同志在抗旱斗争中的行动，在这方面树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    多少年来，旱灾经常危害着人民的生产。以前，每当遭受旱灾袭击的时候，农民对付旱灾的主要方法就是求神拜佛，祈求普降甘霖，消除旱象。现在，虽然没有人运用这种方法了，但是消极等待的“靠天吃饭”思想却还在一些人的脑海中存在着。自然，“靠天吃饭”的思想不能说一点道理也没有，例如，在风调雨顺的时候获得了丰收，这里面不能不说有“天”的一部分“功劳”。但是，当着经久不雨，旱灾业已临头的时候，就不能再来单纯地“靠天”了，必须积极行动起来，向旱灾宣战，并战胜旱灾。
    根据金口生产队在抗旱斗争中取得的成就，证明只要发动起广大群众，树立起“人定胜天”的信念，旱灾是完全可以战胜的。旱灾像人们在实际生活中遇到的其他困难一样，也是具有伸缩性的。人向旱灾退让一步，旱灾就可能向人进逼两步；人向旱灾进逼一步，旱灾就可能被逼向后退让两步。问题就在于人们对旱灾的态度，是向旱灾退让呢？还是向旱灾进攻呢？
      “旱”既成为“灾”，要想战胜它，这决不是一件轻而易举的事情。以金口生产队为例，早稻车水十二次，中稻车水三次至五次，算一算看，这需要付出多么巨大的劳动。在支部书记罗春甫同志的组织领导下，金口生产队这样做了，真正取得了抗旱斗争的胜利。在这个艰巨的斗争中，罗春甫同志一方面能够以身作则，哪里最困难就到哪里和群众一块劳动，鼓舞群众的抗旱热情；一方面又能够集思广益，广泛吸收群众意见，解决抗旱斗争中所遇到的困难。特别值得提出的是，随着旱灾的发展，抗旱斗争越来越艰苦，群众思想问题也越来越多，这时，罗春甫同志仍能及时解决群众的思想问题，坚持了抗旱斗争并取得了胜利。
    现在，一些有旱灾的地方，都在进行抗旱斗争。像罗春甫同志这样的干部很多很多，希望大家都来鼓起干劲，坚持抗旱斗争，使“人定胜天”的信念变为确确凿凿的事实。
