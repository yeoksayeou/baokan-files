Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 19th: According to TASS, the Japanese Socialist Party, in its draft action program for 1959 released on the 18th, stated that a policy of active neutrality and peace is the only correct and acceptable policy for the Japanese people.

The draft program pointed out that the growing worldwide movement to defend peace and prevent new wars, as well as the agreement between Khrushchev and Eisenhower on mutual visits, clearly embodies the peace-loving aspirations of people around the world. The draft program stated that the world is now gradually transitioning from a policy of strength to a policy of negotiation. The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" runs counter to this trend because revising the treaty harbors the danger of dragging Japan into a nuclear war. The draft program emphasized that in this situation, a policy of active neutrality and peace is the only correct and acceptable policy for the people.

The draft program highly praised the great economic achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. It stated that the purchasing power of the people in the Soviet Union and China has increased unprecedentedly.

The draft program pointed out that, however, the military ties maintained between Japan and the United States block the door to restoring diplomatic and economic relations with China.

Speaking of the domestic situation, the draft program pointed out that the Japanese working class is actively launching a struggle against the bourgeoisie's intensification of labor and dismissal of workers, and has combined this struggle with the massive struggle of the Japanese people against the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The draft program pointed out that the ruling class is now sparing no effort in carrying out activities to revise the "Security Treaty" in an attempt to make Japan more militarily subservient to the United States. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to strengthen the anti-communist military alliance and suppress domestic democratic forces with the help of the United States, in order to turn Japan into a military ally of the United States, a base for U.S. nuclear weapons, and to equip the Japanese armed forces with nuclear weapons.

The draft program stated that based on an in-depth analysis of the domestic and international situation in Japan, the Socialist Party believes that it is necessary to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from concluding a new Japan-U.S. treaty with the United States in order to defend the people's rights to life, interests, and peace.

The draft program pointed out that the struggle against revising the "Security Treaty" is closely linked to the common struggle for peace, neutrality, and the restoration of diplomatic relations with China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 20th: Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), announced at the 7th regular convention of the All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union on the 19th that "Sohyo" will launch a large-scale struggle, equivalent to last year's struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," from late October to mid-November, to crush the Japan-U.S. "Security System."

Iwai pointed out that the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" cannot be limited to launching a movement to prevent the revision of this treaty, but should focus on crushing the Japan-U.S. "Security System" itself.

Iwai also announced that unions affiliated with "Sohyo" will launch a struggle to defend workers' rights in September and October.

According to reports, the 8th Kyushu Regional Headquarters Convention of the All-Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union, held in Kagoshima Prefecture from the 19th, adopted slogans for the convention such as opposing suppression, strengthening the struggle to defend workers' rights, and regaining the right to strike.

    日本社会党发表本年度行动纲领
    反对“安全条约”争取和平中立
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社东京19日讯：日本社会党在18日发表的1959年度行动纲领草案说，积极中立的和平政策对日本人民来说是唯一正确和能够接受的政策。
    纲领草案指出，日益壮大的、阻止发生新战争的全世界保卫和平运动以及赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔之间达成相互访问的协议，明显地体现了世界各国人民爱好和平的愿望。纲领草案指出，现在，世界正从实力政策逐渐过渡到谈判政策。岸信介内阁修改日美“安全条约”的政策同这一趋向背道而驰，因为修改这个条约包藏着把日本拖入核战争的危险。纲领草案强调指出，在这种情况下，积极中立的和平政策对人民来说是唯一正确和能够接受的政策。
    纲领草案对苏联和中华人民共和国取得的巨大经济成就给予崇高的评价。它说，苏中两国人民的购买力有了空前的提高。
    纲领草案指出，但是，日本和美国之间保持着军事联系，这就堵塞了通向同中国恢复外交和经济关系的大门。
    谈到国内局势时，纲领草案指出，日本工人阶级积极展开反对资产阶级加强劳动强度和解雇工人的斗争，并且已经把这一斗争同日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的声势浩大的斗争结合起来。
    纲领草案指出，现在，统治阶级不遗余力地进行修改“安全条约”的活动，企图使日本在军事上更加屈从美国。同时，岸信介政府正在企图加强反共的军事联盟和在美国帮助下镇压国内民主力量，以便把日本变成美国的军事盟国，变成美国的核武器基地，并且用核武器来装备日本武装部队。
    纲领草案说，在深入分析日本国内和国际状况的基础上，社会党认为必须阻止岸信介政府同美国缔结新的日美条约，以保卫人民的生活权利、利益与和平。
    纲领草案指出，反对修改“安全条约”的斗争同争取和平、中立以及恢复同中国的外交关系的共同斗争有着密切的联系。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章19日在全日本自治团体工会第七次定期大会上宣布，“总评”将在从10月下旬到11月中旬这一期间，发动规模相当于去年反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争那样的大规模斗争，来粉碎日美“安全体制”。
    岩井指出，关于阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争，不能仅仅停留在展开阻止修改这一条约的运动上，而应该把重点放在粉碎日美“安全体制”本身方面。
    岩井还宣布，“总评”所属工会将在9月和10月展开保卫工人权利的斗争。
    据报道，日本全国电气通信工会从19日起在鹿儿岛县举行的第八次九州地方本部大会，通过了反对镇压、加强保卫工人权利的斗争和夺回罢工权等大会口号。
