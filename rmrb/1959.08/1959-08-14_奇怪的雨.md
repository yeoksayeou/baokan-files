　　Strange Rain
　　Wang Xieshan
    One day in the thirty-first year of Jianwu in the Eastern Han Dynasty (55 AD), dark clouds covered the sky over Chenliu County. A storm attacked the city, and in an instant, heavy rain poured down. However, what fell was not ordinary rainwater, but a kind of black millet. Alarmed people ran around spreading the news, divining good and bad omens. Old people, holding incense and candles, knelt on the ground and prayed to the heavens... This strange news, coupled with a lot of superstitious embellishment, quickly spread throughout the country. Court officials took this opportunity to vigorously promote "heavenly induction," saying that this was heaven bestowing auspiciousness upon the Great Han Dynasty and was a grace given by God to the Han people. Only the philosopher Wang Chong believed that the millet "rain" was not sent by the gods at all, but a natural phenomenon. He said: "The rain of millet, like cloud and rain, also rises from the ground, and is blown together with the wind, mingled in the sky, and gathered on the ground. People see it falling from the sky, and then call it the rain of millet from heaven... This millet grows in the wilderness, and when ripe, it hangs down to the ground. Encountering a sudden storm, it is blown up and flies with it, and when the wind weakens, the millet gathers and falls in China. When China sees it, it is called rain of millet." ("Lunheng": "Ganxu Chapter")
    Here, Wang Chong is very correct. The "millet rain" is not born in the sky, but a huge wind brings them from the ground into the air, and then blows them from the air to another place.
    Similar examples have also occurred in other countries. In 1804, in a certain place on the coast of Spain, a sky full of "wheat rain" suddenly fell. The residents there quickly picked up a lot of grain from the ground. It was later found that a tornado had destroyed a huge granary in Morocco and carried them to Spain.
    Many strange "rains" on Earth are mostly caused by hurricanes, especially tornadoes. A tornado is like a huge, upright elephant trunk, with air rotating around its vertical axis at tremendous speed, creating a huge vortex. This vortex has a great suction force, which can sweep away dust and objects on the ground and carry them to far away places, thus causing all kinds of strange "rain."
    In 1608, a rare rain fell in a small town in France, and the color of the rain was blood-red. Blood-like raindrops were found everywhere in the city, causing great panic, and people thought the end of the world was coming... After a long time, people investigated and found that this "blood rain" was actually a mixture of red dust from the African desert and rainwater. Its arrival was naturally a prank of a hurricane.
    Tornadoes generated at sea sometimes roll up schools of fish and marine life, so in some coastal areas, various "fish rains" are often seen, with large numbers of fish falling from the sky!
    There was also one of the strangest "rains," which was the "silver coin rain." That happened in a village in the Pavlov district of the Gorky region of the Soviet Union. One summer in 1940, with a heavy thunderstorm, many silver coins suddenly poured down from the sky. After the rain, people picked up thousands of medieval silver coins. This was because the heavy rain washed away the soil where the silver coins were buried in ancient times, and the wind carried them to this place.

　　奇怪的雨
　　王燮山
    东汉建武三十一年（公元55年）的某一天，乌云密布陈留郡的上空，暴风袭击着这个城池，霎时间大雨倾盆而下，可是降下来并非是普通的雨水，而是一种黑色的谷子。惊慌的人们纷纷奔走相告，卜算着吉凶；年老的人顶着香烛，跪在地上向天作着祈祷……。这个怪异的消息，加上很多迷信的渲染，很快地传遍全国，朝庭的官员们乘此机会大肆宣扬“天人感应”，说这是上天降瑞于大汉，是上帝赐予汉黎民之恩惠。独有哲学家王充，认为谷“雨”根本不是天神所降，而是一种自然现象。他说道：“夫谷之雨，犹复云雨之亦从地起，因与疾风俱飘，参于天，集于地。人见其从天落也，则谓之天雨谷。……此谷生于草野之中，成熟垂委于地，遭疾风暴起吹扬，与之俱飞，风衰谷集，坠于中国。中国见之，谓之雨谷。”（“论衡”：“感虚篇”）
    在这里，王充说得很正确，“谷雨”并不是天上生就的，而是巨大的风将它们从地面上带到空中，又从空中吹到了别的地方。
    类似这样的例子，在别的国家里也发生过。1804年在西班牙沿海某地，突然降下漫天的“麦雨”，那里的居民们很快地从地上捡到了不少的粮食。事后查明，原来是龙卷风破坏了摩洛哥某处的一个巨大的粮仓，又把它们挟带到西班牙。
    地球上很多奇怪的“雨”，大都是飓风，特别是龙卷风造成的。龙卷风很像一支巨大的直立的象鼻，空气以极大的速度回绕着它的垂直轴旋转，造成巨大的旋涡。这种旋涡的吸吮力很大，能把地面上的尘土和物件席卷而去，带到很远的地方，因而造成各种古怪的“雨”。
    1608年，法国的一个小城中降下一次稀罕的雨，雨的颜色是血红的。全城到处发现鲜血般的雨点，引起了极大的惊恐，人们以为世界末日将临……过了很久人们才调查清楚，这种“血雨”实际是非洲沙漠中的红色尘土和雨水的混合物。它的降临自然是飓风的恶作剧。
    在海上产生的龙卷风，有时把海里的鱼群和海生物卷起来，因此有些沿海地区，常常可见到各种“鱼雨”，大批的鱼儿自天而降！
    还有一次最奇怪的“雨”，是“银币雨”。那发生在苏联的高尔基州巴甫洛夫区的一个村庄，1940年的一个夏天，随着大雷雨，忽然从天上泻下了很多的银币。雨后，人们捡到了数千枚中世纪的银币。这是因为暴雨把古代埋有银币的泥土冲走，大风又把它们带到这个地方来的。
