    On the Rubber Boat
    Jiang Shigao
    The rubber boat had been tossed by the wind and waves for ten hours. Platoon Leader Chen Liangqing and twelve soldiers were vigorously paddling, advancing with difficulty. Exhaustion, fatigue, and hunger were gradually slowing their progress. They were truly drained.
    The river-crossing platoon of a certain unit stationed in Huiyang, Guangdong, had been battling the flood for a full four days and nights. They had transported boatloads of elderly people and children to safety, sent assault troops to dangerous sections of the dike, and delivered food and clothing to the disaster victims. This time, they were transporting three thousand catties of biscuits dropped from the air to Yangmeiao Commune in Tonghu. There, more than two thousand people were camping on the mountain, having gone without food for more than a day.
    As soon as they set out, they encountered a strong wind. Huge waves crashed over them one after another, and the rubber boat drifted in the floodwaters, only to be pushed back by the wind and waves after advancing a few meters. In ten hours, they had only traveled twenty kilometers.
    Chen Liangqing, with bloodshot eyes and wearing a soaking wet uniform, gripped the rudder tightly. The soldiers' hands, wielding the paddles, were covered in blisters, one on top of another. They were sore and exhausted all over. Take Liu Zhongren, for example; he hadn't closed his eyes for two days and a night, and he had six blisters on his hands, the bright red blood staining the paddle handle. Chen Liangqing felt sorry for the soldiers and suggested several times that the crew be divided into two groups to take turns resting, but none of the soldiers wanted to rest. They all wanted to keep fighting.
    Old soldier Yi Wenzhong suddenly broke the silence and began to speak: "Do you think the villagers are starving on the mountain?" At the mention of the word "starving," everyone's stomachs began to rumble again. Little Liu glanced at the biscuits on the boat, swallowed, and gritted his teeth, saying: "I'm not hungry!" Yi Wenzhong said: "Who asked you? I'm asking how the villagers are doing now?" This time, no one answered him.
    In fact, Chen Liangqing had long been feeling faint with hunger. He quietly tightened his belt another notch. In recent days, they had saved food to help the disaster victims, eating only thin porridge and pumpkin. Moreover, they had not eaten anything for twelve hours. At this time, with only one-third of the journey remaining, Chen Liangqing couldn't help but ponder: Could the comrades persevere without eating anything? When they set off, the comrades from the commune party committee had said that the soldiers could eat some of the biscuits on the way, but how could they do that?
    There were only two Communist Party members on the boat, Chen Liangqing and Squad Leader Chen Yuanshao. They quietly exchanged opinions, picked up a package of biscuits, tore open the thin wrapper, and held it out to Little Liu with both hands: "Eat a little, eat, you'll have more strength if you eat!" The biscuits emitted an enticing aroma, and Little Liu's childlike face flushed red. He stared at the platoon leader with wide eyes, and after a long while, he squeezed out a sentence: "I won't eat... I'm not hungry..." The platoon leader then offered the biscuits to Yi Wenzhong, but Yi Wenzhong also refused them. He didn't pass them on to anyone else; he knew that the soldiers would never eat this food meant for the disaster victims.
    Chen Liangqing looked at each of the soldiers on the boat, and finally, his gaze fell on Little Liu again. This new soldier, who had only put on his uniform three months ago and was not yet eighteen years old, had previously impressed him as being lively and lovable, even a little mischievous and unreasonable; but now he had become tall and strong, completely like a veteran soldier. All of this couldn't help but remind him of the years of war, the glorious path our army had traveled, and the beloved Party that taught the soldiers to have noble character. The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. With such soldiers, what enemy could not be defeated, what difficulties could not be overcome!
    At that moment, someone started a song, and everyone joined in: "Comrades! Yo-ho-ho, raise your oars! Yo-ho-ho, ride the wind and waves, move forward, move forward, paddle on!..." The singing grew louder and louder, and the rubber boat moved faster and faster.

    橡皮船上
    江式高
    橡皮船在风浪里颠簸了十个小时了。排长陈良清和十二个战士，奋力摇动着手里的桨，艰难地前进。困顿、疲劳、饥饿，使他们前进的速度渐渐慢了下来。他们实在是筋疲力竭了。
    驻广东惠阳某部渡河排和洪水紧张地搏斗，已经整整四天四夜。他们把一船船老人和孩子送到安全的地方，把突击队员们送到堤坝上危险的地段，把粮食、衣服送给灾民。这一次，他们正把空投下来的三千斤饼干，运向潼湖公社的杨梅坳。那里有两千多人露宿在山上，已经一天多没有吃东西了。
    他们刚一出发，就遇上了大风。巨浪一个接一个扑过来，橡皮船在洪水里漂荡，刚刚前进几公尺，又被风浪推了回来。十小时只前进了二十公里。
    陈良清两眼挂着血丝，穿着一身湿漉漉的军装，紧紧地把着舵。战士们摇着桨的手上，已经起了一重又一重的血泡。他们浑身又累又疼。就拿刘忠仁来说吧，整整两天一宿没合过眼，手上打了六个泡，殷红的血染红了桨把。陈良清心疼战士们，几次要把全船人员分为两个组，轮流休息，但是战士们谁也不愿休息。他们都要坚持战斗下去。
    老战士易文中忽然打破了沉寂，说起话来：“你们说，老乡们在山上饿坏了没有？”一提到“饿”字，大家的肚子里又咕咕地叫起来，小刘望了望船上的饼干，咽了口唾沫，咬了咬牙说：“不饿！”易文中说：“谁问你了？我是说老乡们现在怎样？”这次再也没有人回答他。
    其实，陈良清早就饿得心里发慌了。他悄悄地把皮带又勒紧了一扣。这几天他们把粮食节省下来救济灾民，吃的都是稀饭和南瓜，而且，到现在，他们已经有十二个小时没吃一点东西了。这时，离目的地还有三分之一的路程，陈良清不禁思索起来：不吃东西同志们能不能坚持下去？出发的时候公社党委的同志说过，战士们路上可以吃一点船上的饼干，但这怎么行呢？
    船上只有两个共产党员，陈良清和一班长陈远绍。他们俩悄悄地交换了一下意见，拿起一包饼干，撕开了薄薄的包装纸，双手捧到小刘面前：“吃一点吧，吃吧，吃了更有力气！”饼干发出了一阵阵诱人的香味，小刘孩子般的脸涨得绯红，睁着一双大眼睛看着排长，半天才挤出一句话来：“我不吃……我不饿……。”排长又把饼干拿给易文中，易文中也把它推开了。他没再往下传，他知道战士们决不肯吃这救济灾民的食粮。
    陈良清一个个看着船上的战士，最后他的眼光又落到小刘身上。这个三个月前才穿上军装、年纪还不满十八岁的新战士，平日给他的印象只是活泼可爱，甚至有点调皮，不懂道理；现在却变得高大起来了，他完全像个老战士了。眼前的一切，不禁使他想起了战火纷飞的岁月，想起了我们军队走过的光辉的道路，想起了教育战士们具有高尚品德的亲爱的党。他越想越兴奋，有了这样的战士，还有什么敌人不能打倒，还有什么困难不能克服！
    这时，不知谁起了个头，大家唱起歌来：“同志们哪！哟吼吼，飞起桨哪！哟吼吼，乘风破浪向前进，向前进哪划哟！……”歌声越唱越宏亮，橡皮船行驶得越来越快了。
