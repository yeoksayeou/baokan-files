　　Sailing Ships Race to Transport Salt

　　The Liaoning Province shipping department recently organized nearly two hundred wooden sailing ships in the Bohai Bay, working day and night to transport sea salt ahead of schedule. Large quantities of sea salt are being concentrated from Jin County, Fu County, and surrounding areas to Shihe Port via the Bohai Bay route, and then transported by train from this port to various destinations at home and abroad.

　　In order to organize early transport, the Shihe Shipping Office has transferred tugboats and barges from Yingkou, adopting a combined tugboat and wooden sailing ship transportation method. The Shihe Wooden Sailing Ship Cooperative recently also held a meeting of member representatives to study early transport, sparking a red flag competition between teams, ships, and individuals. Under the slogans of safety, more loading, faster sailing, and full utilization of the tide, the sailors transported more than 300,000 tons of sea salt from the start of navigation in March to the end of July, an increase of 30% compared to the same period last year. Now the sailors plan to transport the 80,000 tons of sea salt originally scheduled for the fourth quarter in the third quarter instead. This means they must transport 120,000 tons of salt each month in August and September. At present, the boatmen are highly motivated and determined to complete the transportation plan as a gift for National Day. (Han Bin)

　　帆船竞发忙运盐
    辽宁省航运部门最近在渤海湾组织了近两百只木帆船，日夜不停地提前运输海盐。大批海盐由金县、复县一带通过渤海湾航线，源源不断地向石河港集中，然后再由这个港口用火车运往国内外各地。
    石河航运办事处为了提前组织运输，已由营口调去了拖轮和驳船，采用了轮木结合运输的办法。石河木帆船合作社最近也召开了社员代表大会，研究提前运输，掀起了一个队与队、船与船、人与人的红旗竞赛。船员们在安全、多装、快跑、充分利用潮水的口号下，从3月份开航到7月底共赶运了海盐三十多万吨，比去年同期增长了30％，现在船员们又要把计划在第四季度运输的海盐提前在第三季度里运出八万吨。这样，他们在8、9月份里，每月都得运输十二万吨盐。目前船工们干劲冲天，决心用完成运输计划来作为国庆节的献礼。　　（韩斌）
