Xinhua News Agency, August 10th dispatch: According to TASS, prominent figures in political circles and newspapers in Western European countries continue to welcome and support the upcoming mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, and condemn the hostile attitude of certain reactionary groups towards such visits.

	Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti writes:
		People of All Countries Should Strive to Create Conditions to Strengthen Peace
Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, published an article in "l'Unità" saying that the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower are "a great boon that the people of all countries have every reason to welcome." He pointed out that this fact shows that the West recognizes that it is necessary to seek "new methods and means of approaching, understanding, and reaching agreement."

Togliatti pointed out that the "Cold War" policy that brought the world to the brink of conflict has failed. He said that the people of all countries should now strive to create conditions to strengthen peace. He pointed out that the most reactionary bourgeois groups and clerical leaders in Italy, France, and West Germany "are attempting to form a triangular alliance to serve as a Cold War fortress, to build a super-nuclear-armed area, and to gradually restrict and eliminate democratic systems." Therefore, the people in this region must especially strengthen the forces of peace.

Italian newspapers criticized the government's dissatisfaction with the news of the Soviet-US leaders' mutual visits. Nenni, the Secretary of the Socialist Party, wrote in "Avanti!" that "European conservatives and reactionaries, especially conservatives and reactionaries in Germany (West Germany), France, and Italy, smiled outwardly upon receiving the news of the mutual visits, but were very worried inwardly."

	Editorial in British "Reynolds News" says:
		Negotiations are Better than Cold War and Hot War
British newspapers continue to welcome the mutual visits between Soviet and US leaders, believing that they are extremely beneficial to resolving international disputes. "Reynolds News" wrote in an editorial: "The Cold War is better than a hot war, but negotiations are better than both (Cold War and hot war). How good it would be if there were more 'peace' and less tension!"

"The Observer" wrote: "We all hope for world peace, but the attitudes of the two most powerful countries in the world towards this issue may be more conducive to achieving this goal than the various different attitudes of some of their allies."

The newspaper pointed out that this meeting between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States may lay the foundation and prepare for a summit conference.

	Danish Prime Minister Hopes Soviet-US Summit Visits Will Be Successful
		Sharply Criticizes the Opposition Party's Attempts to Poison Danish-Soviet Relations
Danish Prime Minister Hansen gave a speech in Roskilde, welcoming the mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. He said that it is very important for the two main figures in modern world politics to meet, exchange views, and discuss urgent issues. He emphasized that if we always show strength and weapons instead of basing ourselves on meetings and negotiations, where will we end up? Therefore, we hope that these mutual visits will be successful.

Hansen sharply criticized Kraft, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, for attempting to poison Danish-Soviet relations by insisting that Khrushchev's visit to Denmark was aimed at "pulling" Denmark away from the West. Kraft also made other slanderous attacks. Hansen said that Kraft's remarks were groundless.

	"German People's News" Condemns the Bonn Clique
		Adenauer is an Obstacle to Easing International Tensions
West German "German People's News" condemned the stubborn attitude of the Bonn ruling clique, pointing out that "Adenauer has not been able to change his attitude at all in accordance with the new situation." The newspaper wrote that Adenauer's policy further exposes him as an obstacle on the road to easing international tensions.

Newspapers of various tendencies in the Netherlands welcomed the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. The Catholic newspaper "De Volkskrant" wrote: "Now the whole world feels more relieved."

　　西欧公众认为苏美首脑互访是大好事
　　必须加强和平力量警惕冷战势力
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社讯：西欧各国政界著名人士和报纸继续表示欢迎和支持将要举行的苏美两国领导人相互访问，并且谴责某些反动集团对这种访问所持的敌视态度。
        意共总书记陶里亚蒂著文指出
        各国人民应当努力创造条件加强和平
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在“团结报”上发表文章说，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔将要互相访问是“世界各国人民完全有理由欢迎的一大好事”。他指出，这一事实表明，西方承认必须寻求“接近、互相谅解和取得一致的新的方法和手段”。
    陶里亚蒂指出，使世界处在冲突边缘的“冷战”政策已经遭到失败。他说，各国人民现在都应当努力创造条件来加强和平。他指出，意大利、法国和西德的最反动资产阶级集团和教权领导集团“企图纠合一个三角联盟来作冷战堡垒，来建立超级原子武装地区，并逐渐限制和消灭民主制度”，因此，这个地区的人民特别要加强和平力量。
    意大利报纸批评政府对苏美领导人互相访问的消息流露的不满。社会党书记南尼在“前进报”上写道，“欧洲的保守党人和反动派，首先是德国（西德）、法国和意大利的保守党人和反动派，他们得到了互相访问的消息，嘴上露出了笑容，但内心却非常忧虑。”
            英国“雷诺新闻”编辑部文章说
        谈判比冷战和热战都好
    英国报纸继续欢迎苏美领导人互访，认为这对解决国际争端极为有利。“雷诺新闻”在编辑部的文章中写道：“冷战比热战要好，但是谈判比二者（冷战与热战）都好。如果‘和平’多点，紧张局势少点，这该多好！” 
    “观察家报”写道：“我们大家都希望世界和平，但是，世界上两个最强大的国家对这个问题的态度可能会比它们某些盟国的形形色色不同的态度更有利于达到这个目的。”
    这家报纸指出，苏、美两国政府首脑这次会谈可能为高级会议奠定开端和作好准备。
              丹麦首相希望苏美首脑互访有成就
        尖锐批评反对党毒化丹苏关系的企图
    丹麦首相汉森在罗斯基勒发表演说，欢迎苏美两国领导人相互访问。他说，现代世界政治两个主要人物会晤、交换意见并讨论迫切问题，这是很重要的。他强调说，如果动辄显示威力和武器，而不以会谈和谈判作为基础，我们会达到什么地步呢？因此我们希望这次互访取得成就。
    汉森尖锐地批评了反对党保守党领袖克拉夫特企图毒化丹苏关系，硬说赫鲁晓夫访问丹麦的目的是要把丹麦从西方“拉”出去。克拉夫特还进行了一些其他诬蔑攻击。汉森说，克拉夫特说这些话是毫无根据的。”
              “德国人民报”谴责波恩集团
        阿登纳是缓和国际局势的一个障碍
    西德“德国人民报”谴责波恩统治集团的顽固态度，它指出，“阿登纳丝毫没有能根据新的情况改变自己的态度。”这家报纸写道，阿登纳执行的政策更加暴露出他自己是缓和国际紧张局势道路上的障碍。
    荷兰各种倾向的报纸欢迎赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将进行的相互访问。天主教报纸“荷兰报”写道：“现在全世界都感到呼吸比较松快了。”
