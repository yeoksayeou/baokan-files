Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 20th: Zeng Ruiguang, the Party Secretary of Chengguan Commune in Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, has consistently adhered to scientific research and experimentation since 1950. He has successfully improved and cultivated more than ten new varieties of animals and plants, becoming a well-known "agricultural expert" in the area.

Zeng Ruiguang's scientific research activities began in 1950. At that time, all agencies in the Bijie Prefecture responded to the call of the CPC Bijie Prefectural Committee and planted some potatoes. Zeng Ruiguang, who worked in the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, actively read Michurin's works in order to grow potatoes well. Following the methods described in the book, he initially succeeded in grafting tomatoes onto potatoes. Later, encouraged by responsible comrades of the Party Committee, he carefully read more than twenty popular science booklets, carried out vernalization experiments on winter wheat, and achieved initial success, shortening the maturity period of wheat from two hundred and forty days to just over one hundred days.

In 1953, Zeng Ruiguang was transferred to work at the Dashui Farm in Jinsha County. He found that local chickens laid few eggs, did not grow much meat, and had poor disease resistance. He actively studied and selected a local Partridge Crested hen to cross with an Australian Black rooster, breeding a new type of chicken. Since then, he has selected good breeds for directional breeding every year. After five or six years of unremitting efforts, this chicken has been initially shaped. This chicken can lay more than two hundred and seventy eggs each year, generally grows to more than four or five *jin* (approximately 2-2.5 kg) in one year, and castrated roosters can grow to thirteen *jin* (approximately 6.5 kg). It also has relatively strong disease resistance and has been named "Hongguang Crested Chicken."

Jinsha County is one of the flue-cured tobacco production areas in Guizhou. However, the local tobacco varieties are very mixed. In order to cultivate good varieties, Zeng Ruiguang conducted three years of continuous research and experimentation: Asexual hybridization was performed between Yunnan’s high-yielding, low-quality multi-leaf tobacco and Guizhou’s high-quality, low-yielding “No. 400” tobacco, cultivating a new tobacco variety called “Jinnong No. 1” with high yield, good quality, and early maturity. This tobacco has now been initially shaped, with a general yield of more than 300 *jin* per *mu* (approximately 2250 kg per hectare), and a maximum of 700 *jin*.

Zeng Ruiguang's achievements in agricultural scientific research have attracted the attention of relevant parties. The Biology Research Group of the Guizhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences believes that the "Hongguang Crested Chicken" he cultivated is a valuable creation. People from Guangxi, Henan, Zhejiang and other provinces (regions) have written letters to congratulate him and requested to purchase fertilized eggs. These reactions further encouraged Zeng Ruiguang's enthusiasm. He continued to work hard to learn scientific knowledge, conduct research and practice with perseverance, and made many new achievements in improving animal husbandry production. For example, by using hybridization methods, he transformed some of the local coarse-wool sheep into fine-wool sheep, and changed ordinary goats into milk goats that produce more than three *jin* of milk per head per day. He also researched methods for detoxifying oil cake, using oil cake as the main feed to fatten more than 800 pigs without consuming a single grain.

Zeng Ruiguang originally only had a primary school education. His ability to achieve many achievements in agricultural scientific research is inseparable from the Party's care and training. In recent years, responsible comrades of the Party at all levels in Guizhou Province have given Zeng Ruiguang a lot of support and encouragement, such as transferring him from administrative departments to work on farms, and then transferring him to people's communes to lead forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, giving him good opportunities to engage in scientific research and experimentation. He was also sent to Beijing for three months of study. Zeng Ruiguang has lived up to the Party's education and training. In addition to actively studying agricultural science, he also taught what he had learned to others, helping and training them. Every time he conducted an experiment, he did it with several assistants. After obtaining results, he handed them over to his assistants to continue, and he went on to conduct new experiments.

    党委书记苦钻科学知识
    曾瑞光采取多种办法提高生产水平
    新华社贵阳20日电　贵州金沙县城关公社党委书记曾瑞光，从1950年起，一贯坚持科学研究和试验工作，改良和培育成功十多种动物、植物新品种，成了当地有名的“农业专家”。
    曾瑞光的科学研究活动是从1950年开始的。那时，毕节专区各机关响应中共毕节地委的号召，都种了一些马铃薯。在专署工作的曾瑞光为了把马铃薯种好，积极翻看米丘林的著作，按照书中讲的办法，试验蕃茄嫁接马铃薯初步成功。后来，在党委负责同志的鼓励下，他又认真地读了科学小册子二十多本，作了冬小麦春化试验，并且获得初步成功，使小麦的成熟期从二百四十天缩短到一百多天。
    1953年，曾瑞光被调到金沙县大水农场工作，他发现当地的鸡生蛋少、长肉不多、抗病力差，就积极钻研，选择一只当地的芦花凤头母鸡和澳洲黑公鸡杂交，育出一种新鸡。以后每年都选择良种作定向繁殖，经过五、六年的不懈努力，使这种鸡初步定型。这种鸡每年能生蛋二百七十多个，一般一年能长到四、五市斤以上，阉过的公鸡能长到十三市斤，抗病能力也比较强，被取名为“红光凤头鸡”。
    金沙县是贵州烤烟产区之一，但是当地烟叶品种很杂。为了培育良种，曾瑞光曾经连续不断地作了三年钻研试验：把云南产量高、质量低的多叶烟和贵州质量好、产量低的“四零零号”烟进行无性杂交。培植成一种产量高、质量好而且成熟期较早的“金农一号”新烟种。现在这种烟已经初步定型，一般亩产三百多斤，最高达到七百斤。
    曾瑞光在农业科学研究中，取得的这些成就，曾经引起有关方面的重视。科学院贵州分院生物研究组认为他培育出的“红光凤头鸡”，是一种有价值的创造。广西、河南、浙江等省（区）都有人写信祝贺他，并要求购买种蛋。这些反应，进一步鼓舞了曾瑞光的干劲。他继续努力地学习科学知识，百折不挠地研究和实践，在改良畜牧业生产方面作出不少新成绩。如曾运用杂交办法，把当地的一部分粗毛羊变成细毛羊，把普通的山羊改变成每头每天产奶三斤多的奶羊；还研究出油枯去毒的方法，用油枯作主要饲料，喂肥八百多头猪，没有耗费一粒粮食。
    曾瑞光原来只有小学文化程度，他在农业科学研究上能取得许多成就，是和党的关怀与培养分不开的。几年来，贵州省各级党的负责同志都给了曾瑞光许多支持和鼓励，如曾经把他从行政部门调到农场工作，以后又调到人民公社去领导林牧副渔等各项生产，使他有从事科学研究和进行试验的良好机会，还送他到北京学习了三个月。曾瑞光不辜负党对他的教育培养，除自己积极研究农业科学外，并把自己学到的知识传授给别人，帮助和培养别人。每次进行试验的时候，他都是和几个助手一同去做，获得成果以后，就交给助手们继续完成，自己再去作新的试验。
