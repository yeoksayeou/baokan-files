    New Developments in Pastoral Areas
    The Sheep with the Most Wool Production
    In May of this year, the Aohan Sheep Farm in Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, sheared 26.8 kilograms of wool from a two-year-old and three-month-old fine-breed ram, No. 540. The wool was 12 centimeters long and 60 count in fineness, setting a new record for the highest wool production in the region.

    This ram is a crossbreed between a Soviet Merino ram and the fourth generation improved No. 80 sheep from the Northeast, concentrating all the excellent characteristics of both parents. After its birth, it was carefully raised. According to the different stages of development, such as the lactation period and weaning period, it was fed with nutritious feed such as juicy fodder, mixed concentrate, eggshell powder, and salt in a timely manner. Therefore, it is physically strong. In two years and three months, its weight reached 73 kilograms, and its wool production was 20% to 47% higher than that of Soviet Merino and Salisk fine-breed sheep.

    Pigeons Transport Semen
    The breeding season for livestock has begun. Sixteen pigeons from the Da Benhong breeding station and its surrounding sub-stations in the Right Banner of Chahar, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are busy transporting ram semen. Although small, they are very capable, with the larger ones able to carry 32 grams at a time and the smaller ones 18 grams. The semen carried by one pigeon at a time can inseminate 160 to 300 sheep. In the past, the work of transporting ram semen was done by riding horses or other means of transportation. Using pigeons, the speed is very fast, and they can fly 15 li in just 10 minutes. Moreover, the semen reduces vibration, and the sperm maintains vigorous vitality.

    Although the labor of these pigeons is very heavy, the remuneration required is very small. The feed cost for one pigeon per day is only one cent.

    In order to complete this work quickly, well, and economically, the technicians of the artificial insemination pilot group of Chahar Right Banner began training sixteen pigeons in March of this year. After more than two months of training, they can now perform one-way and two-way flights. In the non-breeding season, they also perform communication work.

    High-Yield Sheep "Group"
    The Baiyinhua Sheep Farm in Wengniute Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has focused on cultivating a high-yield sheep group, consisting of 150 ewes of appropriate age. So far, 143 ewes have given birth, with a total of 233 lambs born, a breeding rate of 162.9%, an increase of 57.9% compared to 1958.

    The achievement of this high-yield record is mainly due to the use of pregnant mare serum injection in breeding. During the sheep breeding season last year, in order to master the estrus period of ewes, the herdsmen of the sheep farm used rams for teasing half a month before the start of breeding. Then, three or four days before the second estrus, pregnant mare serum was injected, followed by artificial insemination to promote multiple births. Last year, among the 150 ewes in the whole group, 58 were injected with pregnant mare serum, and all of these ewes have now given birth. Among them, 33 gave birth to twins, six gave birth to triplets, four gave birth to quadruplets, and one gave birth to quintuplets. A total of 119 lambs were born, with a breeding rate of 216.7%. The remaining 92 ewes that were not injected with pregnant mare serum also gave birth to 114 lambs.

    牧区新事
    产毛最多的羊只
    内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟敖汉羊场今年5月在一只二岁零三个月的五百四十号良种公羊身上，剪下毛二十六点八公斤，毛长十二公分，毛细六十支纱，创造了产毛量全区最高纪录。
    这只种公羊是苏联美利奴优良种公羊和东北八十号第四代改良种羊杂交的间生种，它的身上集中了双亲的一切优良特性。在它出生后进行了非常细心的饲养，根据哺乳期、断奶期等不同发育阶段，适时贴喂多汁饲料、混合精料、蛋壳粉、食盐等各种富有营养的饲料。因此体质健壮，在两年三个月里，体重即达到七十三公斤，出毛量比苏联美利奴和沙利斯克良种羊还高20％到47％。
    鸽子运送精液
    牲畜配种的季节开始了。内蒙古自治区察哈尔右翼后旗大贲红配种站和周围的几个分站之间，担负着运送种畜精液任务的十六只鸽子，正在忙碌地运送着种公羊的精液。它们体躯虽小，但都很能干，大的一次能负重三十二克，小的能负重十八克。一只鸽子一次运到的精液可以配一百六十只到三百只绵羊。运送种公羊精液的工作，过去是由乘马或其他交通工具来完成的。用鸽子运送速度很快，十五里路它们只需十分钟就能飞到。而且精液减少了振荡，精籽保持旺盛的活力。
    这些鸽子的劳动虽然很繁重，但所要的报酬却很少，一只鸽子一天的饲料费只有一分钱就够了。
    察哈尔右翼后旗绵羊人工授精试点组的技术员们，为了多快好省地完成这项工作，今年3月开始调教了十六只鸽子，经过两个多月的训练，现在它们已能作单程、双程飞行；在非配种季节里，它们还要担任通讯工作。
    绵羊“高产群”
    内蒙古自治区翁牛特旗白音花羊场，重点培育了一个绵羊高产群，共有适龄母羊一百五十只。到目前已有一百四十三只母羊产羔，共接羔二百三十三只，繁殖率达162.9％，比1958年提高57.9％。
    这个高产纪录的取得，主要是在配种上用妊娠马血清注射的方法。去年绵羊配种时期，羊场的牧工们为掌握母羊的发情期，在开始配种前半个月利用种公羊进行试情，然后在第二次发情前三四天注射妊娠马血清，再进行人工授精，促使多胎。去年，全群一百五十只母羊中注射妊娠马血清的母羊有五十八只，这批母羊现在已全部接产。其中一胎产双羔的有三十三只，一胎产三羔的六只，一胎产四羔的四只，一胎产五羔的一只。共计产羔一百一十九只，繁殖率达216.7％。其余没有注射妊娠马血清的九十二只母羊也产羔一百一十四只。
