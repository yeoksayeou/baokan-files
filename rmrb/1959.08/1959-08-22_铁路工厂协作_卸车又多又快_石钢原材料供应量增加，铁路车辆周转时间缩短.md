Our Special Correspondent Xu Bingzhong reports: Under the specific leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the Beijing Railway Bureau have unified their thinking, unified their actions, and cooperated closely, launching a mass movement to unload more cars and unload them faster, resulting in a significant increase in unloading capacity. From August 9th to 15th, the number of freight cars unloaded daily at the company increased from an average of 275 cars per day in July to 417 cars, an increase of 51%. The time that cars spent at the factory was also greatly shortened, with the average for the second week of August being six and a half hours shorter than the first week. This rapidly reversed the situation of vehicle backlog and transportation and unloading work lagging behind production needs.

After the new No. 3 blast furnace and No. 3 coke oven of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company were put into operation in May of this year, the volume of transportation and unloading increased sharply. The original transportation equipment, lines, stockyards, and unloading manpower all felt inadequate. On the other hand, the coordination between the company and the railway department in their work was not close enough. This resulted in insufficient supply of raw materials and a large backlog of freight cars awaiting unloading, which not only affected steel production but also prevented railway cars from turning around faster. In order to change this situation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened the leading cadres of the two units for several consecutive meetings, defining the guarantee of transportation and supply for steel production and the acceleration of railway car turnaround as the common tasks of both parties. Leading cadres and relevant staff members from both sides also held "brainstorming" meetings. On the basis of unified thinking between the two parties, the experience of collaboration between the Benxi Road and Factory was promoted. Unified planning, unified organization, and unified dispatch were implemented in transportation. The two parties established a joint office, with cadres mutually assigned to the factory and station. Transportation dispatch personnel from both parties implemented a mutual contact system. This made it easier for both parties to understand the situation, jointly direct transportation, and promptly coordinate to solve problems. After a month of joint efforts, the situation of insufficient supply of raw materials and a large backlog of vehicles at Shijingshan Steel has been improved. Since August, the number of cars awaiting unloading in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company every day has been reduced to below the turnaround number specified in the plan.

In order to adapt the number of vehicles arriving at Shijingshan Steel every day to the factory's internal lines, stockyards, and unloading capacity, the Beijing Railway Bureau has taken many measures to balance the number of vehicles, types of materials, and train times. Shijingshan Steel needs a variety of raw materials in large quantities, and the supply points are scattered in various places, but the factory has few internal lines and small stockyards, and in the past, raw materials arrived unevenly. When vehicles arrived in concentrated batches, it often caused frequent shunting or even congestion within the factory. Unloading workers and unloading machinery were also busy at times and idle at others, and their capacity could not be fully utilized. In order to solve this problem, the Beijing Railway Bureau organized units such as the Longyan Iron Mine and the Fengfeng Coal Mine to dispatch vehicles evenly every day according to the vehicle requisition plan submitted by Shijingshan Steel. Before vehicles enter the factory, the relevant stations in Beijing will pre-report the number of vehicles, types of materials, and arrival times to Shijingshan Steel in advance so that both parties can be prepared. The railway department also specially set up a locomotive to transport empty cars that have been unloaded, and replaced the small locomotive specially used for shunting at Shijingshan Steel with a large locomotive. This series of measures has created very favorable conditions for Shijingshan Steel to accelerate unloading.

In terms of improving unloading capacity, the leading cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company went to the front line and launched three mass movements to unload more cars and unload them faster, and took a series of effective measures to improve unloading capacity, which gradually increased the number of cars unloaded. They vigorously strengthened transportation dispatch work and gave full play to the work efficiency of unloading machinery and unloading workers. In the past, transportation dispatch personnel often made unloading plans and started shunting cars only after taking over the shift, which meant that unloading machinery and unloading workers had to wait for more than an hour before they could start working. Now, the dispatch personnel of the previous shift make a dispatch plan for the next shift before leaving work and transfer the vehicles to the unloading location, so that the workers of the next shift can start working as soon as they start work. At the same time, the company also adjusted more than 20 lines and stockyards, reducing the time vehicles spent waiting for lines and stockyards. In terms of maintenance of unloading machinery, planned maintenance and dedicated personnel were implemented, reducing the situation of mechanical equipment waiting for repair due to illness. In the first half of August, the average number of electric shovels and bulldozers in operation every day increased by one unit compared to the past. The company also transferred 800 workers to form an unloading assault team to specialize in unloading vehicles that had been backlogged in the past. In this way, the company can also evenly send products out of the factory and send out vehicles that have been unloaded, which has improved the throughput capacity of Shijingshan Station.

### 铁路工厂协作　卸车又多又快  石钢原材料供应量增加，铁路车辆周转时间缩短

    铁路工厂协作　卸车又多又快
    石钢原材料供应量增加，铁路车辆周转时间缩短
    本报讯　本报特约记者徐炳忠报道：石景山钢铁公司和北京铁路管理局在中共北京市委的具体领导下，统一思想，统一行动，密切协作，掀起了多卸车、快卸车的群众运动，使卸车能力显著增长。8月9日到15日，这个公司每天进厂货车卸空的数量，已由7月份平均每日卸二百七十五车增加到四百一十七车，卸车数量增加了51％。车辆停厂时间也大大缩短，8月份第二周比第一周平均缩短了六小时半。这样便迅速扭转了车辆积压和运输装卸工作落后于生产需要的局面。
    今年5月，石景山钢铁公司新建的三高炉、三焦炉投入生产以后，运输装卸量急剧增加，原有的运输设备、线路、料场和装卸人力都感到不足；另一方面，这个公司和铁路部门双方在工作中的配合也不够紧密协调。这样，就造成了原材料供应不足和进厂的大批货车积压待卸，不仅使钢铁生产受到影响，也使铁路车辆不能加速周转。为了改变这种状况，中共北京市委召集这两个单位的领导干部连续举行了多次会议，把保证钢铁生产的运输供应和加速铁路车辆的周转定为双方的共同任务。双方从领导干部到有关工作人员也都开会“务虚”。在双方思想统一的基础上，推广了本溪路厂协作的经验，在运输方面实行统一计划，统一组织，统一调度。双方成立了联合办公室，互派干部驻厂驻站，双方运输调度人员实行了互相联系的制度。这样就便于双方了解情况，共同指挥运输，及时配合解决问题。经过一个月来的共同努力，现在石钢原材料供应不足和车辆大批积压的情况已经改善。8月份以来，石景山钢铁公司每天厂内待卸的车数，已经降低到计划规定的周转数量以下。
    为了使每天到达石钢的车辆与厂内的线路、料场和装卸能力相适应，北京铁路管理局采取很多办法，使车辆数、材料品种和列车时间力求均衡。石钢所需的原材料品种多，数量大，供应地点分散在各地，但是厂内的线路少，料场小，过去原材料到达又不均衡。当车辆集中到达时，往往造成厂内调车频繁甚至堵塞；装卸工人和装卸机械也时忙时闲，能力不能充分发挥。为了解决这个问题，北京铁路管理局根据石钢提出的要车计划，组织龙烟铁矿、峰峰煤矿等单位每日均衡地发车；北京各有关车站在车辆进厂前，便将车数、材料品种和到车时间提前向石钢预报，使双方有所准备。铁路部门还专设了一台机车向外运送已经卸货的空车，并把专门用来给石钢调车的小机车换成了大机车。这一系列措施，给石钢加速卸车创造了非常有利的条件。
    在提高卸车能力方面，石景山钢铁公司的领导干部亲临现场，发动了三次多卸车、快卸车的群众运动，采取了一系列提高卸车能力的有效措施，使卸车数量逐步提高。他们大力加强了运输调度工作，充分发挥了装卸机械和装卸工人的工作效率。过去，运输调度人员往往在接班之后才根据情况作出卸车计划，开始调车对车，这就使装卸机械和装卸工人要等待一个多小时才能开始工作。现在，上一班的调度人员在下班前就给下一班作好调度计划，并将车辆调到卸车地点，使下一班的工人一上班就能开始工作。同时，这个公司还调整了线路、料场二十多处，减少了车辆等线路，等料场的时间；在装卸机械维护保养方面，实行了计划检修和专人专责的办法，减少了机械设备因病待修的情况，8月上半月平均每天运转的电铲、推土机都分别比过去增加了一台。这个公司还抽调了八百名工人组成卸车突击大队，专门卸过去积压的车辆。这样，这个公司也就能均衡地发送产品出厂和送出已经卸空的车辆，使石景山车站提高了吞吐能力。
