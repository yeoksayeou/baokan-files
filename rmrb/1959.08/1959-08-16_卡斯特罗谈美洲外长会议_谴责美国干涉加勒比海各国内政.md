Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th: Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro said in a television and radio address on the night of the 14th that the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers currently being held in Santiago, Chile, is a "farce." He said that this meeting is entirely "part of a campaign against Cuba."

Castro condemned the suggestion made by US Secretary of State Herter at the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers to interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries. Castro said that what needs to be discussed is the economic problems of the American continent.

In his speech, Castro focused on exposing the collusion between US imperialism and the Dominican dictator Trujillo in plotting counter-revolutionary schemes in Cuba. He said that recently, Cuban authorities seized four batches of weapons on the Cuban coast, one of which was shipped from the United States, and the rest from the Dominican Republic. Planes taking off from Miami, USA, frequently circled over Cuban territory, dropping leaflets and weapons to rebels, and secretly transporting Cuban war criminals to the United States. He said that Cuban war criminals and traitors to the people are still allowed to do whatever they want in the United States as in the past. The Dominican consul in Miami continues to ship weapons abroad for use in attacking Cuba.

Castro also condemned the slanderous propaganda carried out by American newspapers against the Cuban government. He said that this propaganda campaign is part of the entire plan against Cuba.

    卡斯特罗谈美洲外长会议
    谴责美国干涉加勒比海各国内政
    新华社15日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗14日夜在电视广播演说中说，目前正在智利圣地亚哥举行的美洲外长会议是一出“滑稽剧”。他说，这个会议完全是“反对古巴的运动的一部分”。
    卡斯特罗谴责美国国务卿赫脱在美洲外长会议提出的干涉加勒比海各国内政的建议。卡斯特罗说，需要讨论的是美洲大陆的经济问题。
    卡斯特罗在演说中着重揭露了美帝国主义和多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略串通一气，在古巴策划反革命阴谋。他说，最近古巴当局在古巴海岸缴获了四批武器，其中一批是从美国运来的，其余是从多米尼加来的。从美国迈阿密起飞的飞机经常在古巴领土上空盘旋，给谋叛者投掷传单和武器，还秘密地把古巴战犯载运到美国去。他说，古巴战犯和人民的叛徒仍像过去一样在美国被容许为所欲为。多米尼加驻迈阿密的领事继续在向外运送武器作为进攻古巴之用。
    卡斯特罗还谴责了美国报纸对古巴政府所进行的诬蔑宣传。他说，这种宣传活动是整个反对古巴计划的一部分。
