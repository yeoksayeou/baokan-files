The Fushilipu Production Brigade of Jiekou Commune in Tianshui City, Gansu Province, currently has 117 households and 566 people. Before liberation, the land here could only yield 30 to 60 catties of grain per mu. After paying land rent and exorbitant taxes, the masses had very little left, living a life of hunger, cold, and displacement. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, through rent reduction and interest rate control, land reform, and the cooperative movement, the masses quickly organized themselves and fought against nature, and grain production increased year by year. In 1955, the first year of cooperativization, the average yield per mu reached 250 catties. In 1956, an advanced agricultural cooperative was established, and the average yield per mu was more than 280 catties. In 1957, production decreased due to a severe flood. In 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, the average yield per mu reached more than 350 catties, with an average of more than 740 catties per person. In recent years, livestock and poultry have also developed greatly.

With the development of production, the lives of the commune members have improved greatly. Now, 244 new houses have been built in the village, and kindergartens, nurseries, maternity hospitals, homes for the elderly, public canteens, and sewing groups have been established. Water mills have been built, electric lights have been installed, and tap water can go directly to the canteens. Cultural, educational, and health work has also been carried out particularly well. There are one private primary school and one spare-time school, and more than 95% of school-age children are enrolled. More than 100 people regularly study in spare-time schools. Libraries, clubs, amateur theater troupes, wired broadcasting, and meteorological stations have also been established. This brigade carried out effective work last year during the tense situation of large-scale steel production and the rush to harvest autumn crops. It not only completed the task of large-scale steel production, but also harvested and stored all the grain and firewood. The grain output was reported truthfully, how much was produced was reported. After the canteens were established, great attention was paid to saving grain and controlling consumption. The procurement tasks were completed in a timely manner, and the supply of food rations for the commune members was also guaranteed. They eat an average of 34 catties of grain per person per month, and can still have more than 5,000 catties left over by the wheat harvest. When raising pigs, chickens, and ducks in a centralized manner, the principle of voluntariness and reasonable price reduction was fully adopted. Various welfare undertakings were carried out according to the needs and practical possibilities of the masses, without any formalism. Now, all the members are united, the cadres and the masses are closely connected, the production and life order is well-organized, everyone is in a happy mood, and their enthusiasm is soaring. They are working hard to strive for a greater harvest in 1959.

The key to this team's ability to achieve such great results lies in the correct leadership of the Party branch and the full play of the core fortress role of the Party branch. In all its work, the branch has steadfastly adhered to the principles of putting politics in command and following the mass line. They paid attention to combining the actual situation and implementing the Party's policies and instructions; carried out in-depth and meticulous political and ideological education work and thorough organizational work among the masses; and adhered to the working method of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." They provided many specific experiences in these areas.

	In-depth and meticulous political and ideological education work

The Fushilipu Party Branch regularly pays attention to conducting systematic political and ideological education work for Party members and commune members. In the past movements, socialist and communist education has been carried out, greatly raising the political consciousness of Party members and commune members. During the cooperativization period, they educated the commune members on organizing and taking the road to collective prosperity, overcoming the mentality of satisfaction with the status quo that arose among the masses after the land reform due to the rise in living standards, enabling the masses to have the desire to organize. After cooperativization, some commune members developed capitalist ideas, believing that participating in cooperatives was not free and doubting the superiority of cooperativization. The Party branch regularly educated Party members and the masses through Party classes and spare-time schools, explaining the superiority of cooperativization and the correct relationship between collective and individual interests, and strengthened the determination of the commune members to take the socialist road. After communization, the Party branch also educated the commune members on the superiority of communization and the communist prospects, enabling Party members and commune members to further clarify the Party's policies and guidelines for building socialism in rural areas and the specific road to communism.

In addition to regularly conducting systematic socialist education for Party members and commune members, the branch pays special attention to understanding and studying the ideological dynamics of the masses and conducting ideological education work when carrying out each task. No matter how urgent the task is, the branch always insists on using its own or foreign facts and experiences to explain to Party members and commune members why they should do this and how they should do it, so that the requirements of the leadership become the conscious actions of the masses. They regard explaining the significance of completing the task and the methods of completing the task as part of ideological work, and never act rashly or simplistically. This working method of theirs seems to make the work slower on the surface, but once the theory is grasped by the masses, it will become a huge material force. When the masses truly understand the truth, they will unleash infinite potential on a conscious and voluntary basis. Therefore, in reality, the task is not slow to complete, but faster and better. Before the spring plowing this year, the commune Party committee proposed that fertilizer transportation should be mechanized, which was a big task and time was tight. After accepting this task, the branch did not immediately ask the commune members to make carts, but mobilized the commune members to calculate a detailed account comparing the transportation of people and animals with the transportation of carts, making the commune members realize the superiority of mechanized transportation. As a result, all the commune members took active action and built 84 various vehicles within five days. Not only did they complete the urgent task of delivering manure on time, but they also saved a lot of labor for wheat field management.

Their method of doing ideological education work is flexible and diverse. Education is carried out using the methods of factual comparison, living people and events, combining individual assistance with collective assistance, and combining praise with criticism, targeting different objects and different situations. Although these methods are different, they can all achieve good results. Some ideological problems of the commune members are usually educated by comparing the changes in life before and after liberation in the village and certain things in real life. For example, when grain was purchased in 1958, some commune members were unwilling to sell more surplus grain. The branch compared the suffering suffered during the severe famine in 1929 with the fact that they suffered the same famine in 1957, but due to the strong support of the Party, they successfully overcame the famine. This unified the thinking of the commune members and completed the procurement task. The characteristic of the masses is "seeing is believing." Some problems are not easy for the masses to understand by only explaining the principles. The branch uses typical figures and typical examples to let the commune members see with their own eyes, so that the commune members can easily be convinced. A deputy captain of a production team had experience in production, but was ideologically conservative. The branch often asked him to participate in experience exchange meetings and visit advanced technology exhibitions. Under the education of these vivid facts, he broadened his horizons, improved his understanding, overcame his conservative ideas, and became an active promoter of advanced experience. In the sanitation campaign, the organization visited sanitation model units, and everyone actively took action and quickly caught up with the model units. The branch pays more attention to individual assistance in the education of Party members and commune members. However, in order to better help the person concerned and educate the masses, the method of collective assistance is sometimes adopted. Generally, when someone's ideological problem is representative or the misunderstanding is not enough and more strength is needed to help, a meeting is held to carry out criticism, and everyone helps to improve their understanding.

	Sound organizational leadership, thorough organizational work

The Fushilipu Party Branch has eleven Party members. The branch pays great attention to giving play to the role of Party members. When implementing the Party's policies and guidelines and solving major problems in the production and life of the masses, the Party committee first conducts research, and then discusses it among all Party members, and then implements it among the masses through various forms. In this way, it is possible to first unify the thinking within the Party and give full play to the role of Party members. For some emergencies, after the Party committee studies them, it convenes a meeting of Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres to convey and implement them. In order to enable Party members to maintain close ties with the masses, the branch often puts forward specific requirements for Party members. At ordinary times, Party members are required to do their own work well; at the same time, they must regularly understand the opinions and requirements of the masses, and report to the branch regularly; conduct publicity and education to the masses, explain the Party's policies; and help the masses solve difficulties and problems. When encountering difficulties, Party members are required to play a more exemplary role and use practical actions to influence and unite the masses. The methods for Party members to contact the masses and carry out work among the masses are diverse. At ordinary times, they often contact the masses and carry out activities according to the area of residence and fixed division of labor. In the event of an emergency, Party members are required to use all opportunities and occasions to understand the opinions of the masses and carry out publicity and explanation work to the masses. The leading cadres of the branch also pay special attention to contacting the masses and understanding the situation of the masses.

The branch also pays attention to giving play to the role of the Communist Youth League organization and the team committee. This team has fourteen members of the Communist Youth League. The branch often assigns certain work tasks to the members of the Communist Youth League through the Communist Youth League organization, requiring them to maintain close ties with the masses and publicize and explain the Party's policies. In the work of deep plowing the land, autumn harvesting and planting, field management, eliminating the four pests, and paying attention to hygiene, attention is paid to giving play to their shock role, and actively supporting them in organizing the "Huang Jiguang Team" and the "Red Girl Team" to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. They are required to play a backbone role in political and cultural studies. The Party branch realizes the leadership of production work through the production team. Issues such as production plans, distribution plans, financial income and expenditure, and the lives of the masses are generally discussed and decided by the Party branch, and then specifically discussed and implemented through the team committee or cadre meetings.

The branch is good at planning and arranging work, and pays attention to checking the implementation of the plan. The branch formulates a work plan based on the production situation and various work tasks in each period. In the process of implementing the plan, it is promptly specifically arranged, so that the long-term plan is closely combined with the short-term arrangement. This spring, five tasks, including fighting drought, rectifying the commune, accumulating fertilizer, hygiene, and clearing warehouses, were crowded together. The branch made appropriate plans and arrangements based on the characteristics of each task and the personnel required. Fighting drought required mobilizing all commune members to participate, so it was decided that from 5:30 am to 8:30 am, all commune members would go to the river to carry ice to the mountain land. Rectifying the commune also required all commune members to participate, so it was arranged to be carried out in the evening. Accumulating fertilizer, hygiene, and clearing warehouses did not require all commune members to participate, so it was decided that special personnel would be responsible for leading the professional teams in the morning and afternoon. In this way, activities were concentrated at both ends, and carried out separately in the middle, and various tasks could be completed on time without affecting or involving each other. They also pay attention to grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other. During the tense autumn harvest last year, the branch paid special attention to the arrangement of the commune members' lives. In addition to emphasizing the need to do a good job in the work of nurseries and kindergartens, special attention was paid to running the canteen well to ensure that the commune members ate well and were full. The branch urged and strictly checked production work. Special attention is paid to the inspection of quality. When it is found that there are unqualified quality requirements, it must be redone, and never be sloppy, and leading cadres must personally participate until it is done well. For example, the field ridges built when planting rice were checked by the branch secretary and found to be unqualified, so they were redone under his personal participation. For the work of various professional personnel, labor quotas and specific requirements are separately stipulated, and the implementation is checked on time. In addition to conducting on-site inspections, various professional personnel meetings are held regularly to help solve difficulties and problems in their work. Rewards or criticisms are given for each task based on the inspection results. In addition to leadership inspections, mass inspections and evaluations are also organized. The branch is also good at appropriately using cadres according to the characteristics of each person and the needs of the work, and is good at grasping the timing and key points and rationally arranging forces. Chairman Mao said: The responsibility of leaders boils down mainly to giving ideas and using cadres. This branch not only gives good ideas, but is also good at using cadres and giving play to their strengths. For example, the production team leader is good at managing the lives of commune members and the material property of the production team, so he is assigned to be responsible for logistics and internal affairs. The deputy team leader has experience in production and can study hard, so he is assigned to be responsible for grasping production. Some Party members are good at cooking, so they are sent to work in the canteen. They also pay special attention to strengthening the personnel allocation of important positions. The accountant, cashier, cook, and breeder of the production team are all selected from loyal and reliable people who can be competent for the job. In this way, cadres can all be in their proper positions and do their work well. When leading the work, the branch pays attention to grasping the timing, distinguishing priorities, and appropriately arranging the use of forces, concentrating the forces on the decisive aspects. For example, last autumn, when the corn was ripe and urgently needed to be harvested, there was also the task of steelmaking, so the labor force was particularly tight. They seized the critical moment of harvesting corn, which was an "opportunity that must not be missed," and organized all the labor force to first harvest and store the corn before the steelmaking labor force left; after the main labor force was transferred away, the remaining half of the labor force and women and children of the whole team were reorganized and harvested. As a result, not only was all the grain recovered, but all the firewood was also recovered.

	Mass line working method

The Fushilipu Party Branch pays attention to discussing work with the masses. For example, in the communization movement in 1958, they also centralized the commune members' pigs, chickens, ducks, etc. for breeding. At the beginning, the branch explained the benefits of centralized breeding to the commune members and insisted on the principle of voluntariness. After discussion by the masses, a part of them were centralized and raised by the team under the principle of voluntariness. In winter, the branch considered that collective breeding was not well managed and was prone to problems. If there were losses, it would be detrimental to the masses. Therefore, they discussed with the masses and decided that they could be taken back for self-raising. As a result, some were taken back, and some were willing to return them to the team at a reduced price. In this way, the masses were more satisfied. When promoting advanced experience and taking major measures, the branch insists on letting go of the masses and experimenting in every possible way, using the masses' own personal experience to educate the masses. Therefore, the new technologies and measures they have adopted in recent years can be smoothly promoted and have achieved remarkable results. For example, when promoting the "Golden Queen" corn seeds, each of the four teams was required to take out three and a half mu of land for experimentation. As a result, the three teams that planted the "Golden Queen" all greatly increased production, while one team that insisted on planting old varieties due to ideological problems had low yields. This educated the masses and paid attention to promoting good varieties. The branch regularly organizes competitions and evaluations between teams and teams, between work groups and work groups, and between individuals and individuals. For example, in the large-scale soil and water conservation movement, quotas and quality standards for various operations were stipulated, and competitions were organized between various work groups. The work efficiency of digging fish scale pits alone was doubled. After this competition came to an end, serious evaluations were conducted, and the winners were commended. The competition and evaluation of agriculture, sideline production, service industry, hygiene, and other work organized in 1958 greatly promoted the leap forward of various tasks through mutual inspection, on-site visits, and regular evaluations. At the end of the year, a summary evaluation was conducted, and 73 labor models and advanced figures in various fields were selected, setting an example for the masses. This method of establishing banners, promoting advanced elements, and using advanced elements to drive the backward elements has powerfully mobilized all positive factors and changed some weak links and backward aspects of the work.

The branch pays special attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, accepting criticisms from the masses, and improving its own ideological style in its leadership work, but it does not cater to the masses and become the tail of the masses. When sowing corn last year, the agricultural technology promotion station required "deep ditches, wide ridges, and dense planting." However, it was difficult to complete the sowing of a large area in a short period of time using this method. The masses asked to change the method. The branch accepted the opinions of the masses and changed to the method of "plow ditch, strip sowing, and spot planting," and completed the task on time without delaying the farming season. When carrying out large-scale land deep plowing cooperation, some of the masses had the idea of departmentalism, proposing not to help other production teams. The branch did not accept this view and criticized this wrong idea, explaining that others helped us deep plow the land, and now we do not help others, which is a lack of communist spirit of cooperation. As a result, the masses were persuaded and the task of cooperation was completed. This practice of being able to accept the correct opinions of the masses, improve the work, and correct the wrong opinions of the masses, improve the consciousness of the masses, and implement the Party's policies and guidelines truly embodies the principle of the Party's mass line.

The leading cadres of the branch often visit the masses and give care and help in their lives. They often visit the elderly in the homes for the elderly and visit the families of military martyrs. The branch felt that there were too many and too long meetings, which affected the production and rest of the commune members, so they tried to reduce the number of meetings and improve the methods of holding meetings. Prepare well before the meeting, concentrate some of the content to be discussed and ask one person to talk about it to shorten the meeting time. During the Spring Festival dinner, the cadres asked the cooks to rest and personally served them dishes and food. When commune members are sick, they seek medical treatment and medicine everywhere. This spirit of deep concern for the masses fully reflects their high mass concept.

	Strong leadership core

Why is this branch able to do such an outstanding job? A very important reason is that the branch has a strong leadership core. This leadership core has grown up from the masses after being tested by various struggles and tempered by mass movements. The branch secretary, He Bingyan, had been a long-term worker for the landlord for twelve years since he was nine years old. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, he actively participated in various struggles from the beginning. He has a clear class stand in the struggle and is a backbone in the struggle. He Yousheng, the deputy secretary of the branch and deputy team leader, had also been a long-term worker for the landlord for twelve years. After liberation, he actively participated in various struggles and took the lead in organizing mutual aid groups. He can study hard and has great enthusiasm in production. He Yuansheng, a member of the branch committee and team leader, was born into a poor peasant family and is good at managing the family. This leadership core has been united for nearly ten years and has close ties with the masses. They have the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly as communist Party members and noble character. They are fair in their work and always consider the interests of the collective. For example, at the end of the year distribution in 1957, because of the disaster, the income of the masses decreased, so the branch secretary voluntarily temporarily received less remuneration than he should have received, and in 1958, he voluntarily received less subsidies than he should have received. They have a democratic style and can discuss matters with the masses. They always set an example in everything, especially in participating in labor, which can be called a model. For example, last year, the branch secretary worked 156 labor days, the branch committee member and production team leader worked 134 labor days, and the branch deputy secretary and deputy team leader worked 241 labor days. The average number of labor days for the three was 177, accounting for 98.3% of the average number of labor days for the team. They have also been working a lot in recent months. Their work style is down-to-earth and realistic.

Under the leadership of the Party at a higher level, this leadership core, relying on all Party members and relying on its own excellent ideological qualities and exemplary behavior, unites and leads the masses. The masses also regard the Party organization and them as reliable leaders based on the Party organization's outstanding work and their excellent character. In this way, this team has truly achieved unity between the top and the bottom, unity within and without, and truly formed a situation in which there is both democracy and centralism, both freedom and discipline, both unified will and personal happiness, so that the team's production and work have achieved great success.

    中共天水市五十里铺生产队支部工作经验
　　中共天水市委
    甘肃省天水市耤口公社五十里铺生产队，现有一百一十七户，五百六十六人。解放前，这里的土地每亩只能收获粮食三十到六十斤，群众除去交纳地租和苛捐杂税以外，所剩无几，过着忍饥号寒、颠沛流离的生活。解放后，在党的领导下，经过减租减息、土地改革和合作化运动，群众迅速组织起来，向自然展开斗争，粮食产量逐年有了增加。1955年合作化的第一年，平均亩产达二百五十斤，1956年成立高级农业社，平均亩产二百八十多斤，1957年因遭受特大水灾，减了产，1958年大跃进，平均亩产达到三百五十多斤，每人平均七百四十多斤。几年来，牲畜、家禽也有很大发展。
    随着生产的发展，社员的生活有了很大的改善。现在全村已修建了二百四十四间新房屋，成立了幼儿园、托儿所、妇产院、敬老院、公共食堂和缝纫组。修建了水磨，安装了电灯，自来水可以直通食堂。文教卫生工作也开展得特别好。有民办小学和业余学校各一所，95％以上的适龄儿童入了学，经常在业余学校学习的有一百多人。还建立了图书馆、俱乐部、业余剧团、有线广播和气象站。这个队在去年大办钢铁和突击秋收的紧张情况中，进行了有成效的工作。既完成了大办钢铁的任务，又将粮食柴草全部收好藏好。粮食产量是产多少，报多少作风老老实实。办起食堂以后，非常注意节约粮食，控制用量。及时地完成了征购任务，也保证了社员口粮的供应。他们平均每人每月吃粮三十四斤，到麦收时还可剩余五千余斤。在集中饲养猪、鸡、鸭的时候，完全采取自愿的原则和合理折价的办法。各种福利事业都是按照群众的需要和实际可能举办的，没有形式主义的现象。现在是全体队员团结一致，干部群众亲密无间，生产生活秩序井然，人人心情舒畅，干劲冲天，正在为争取1959年的更大丰收而努力奋斗。
    这个队所以能够取得这样巨大的成绩，关键在于党支部的正确领导，在于党支部充分发挥了核心堡垒作用。支部在各项工作中，都踏踏实实地坚持执行了政治挂帅和走群众路线的原则。他们注意结合实际情况，贯彻执行了党的政策、指示；在群众中进行了深入细致的政治思想教育工作和周密的组织工作；坚持执行了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法。他们在这些方面提供了许多具体的经验。
      深入细致的政治思想教育工作
    五十里铺党支部经常注意对党员和社员进行系统的政治思想教育工作。在历次运动中，都贯穿着社会主义和共产主义的教育，大大地提高了党员和社员的政治觉悟。合作化时期，他们对社员进行了组织起来走集体富裕的道路的教育，克服了当时群众在土改后由于生活水平上升而产生的满足现状的思想，使群众有了组织起来的要求。合作化后，有些社员滋长了资本主义思想，认为参加合作社不自由，怀疑合作化的优越性。党支部经常通过党课、业余学校对党员和群众进行教育，讲明合作化的优越性、集体与个人利益的正确关系，坚定了社员走社会主义道路的决心。公社化后，党支部又对社员进行了公社化的优越性、共产主义远景的教育，使党员和社员进一步明确了在农村建设社会主义的方针、政策和走向共产主义的具体道路。
    支部除经常对党员和社员进行系统的社会主义教育外，在进行每项工作的时候，都特别注意了解和研究群众的思想动态，进行思想教育工作。不论任务怎样紧迫，支部总是坚持用自己的或外地的事实和经验，向党员和社员说明为什么要这样做，应该怎样做，使领导上的要求变为群众的自觉行动。他们把交代完成任务的意义和完成任务的方法，看作是思想工作的一部分，从不草率从事和简单化。他们的这种工作方法，从表面看来，工作做得好像慢一些，但是理论一旦掌握了群众，就会成为巨大的物质力量。当群众真正懂得了道理之后，在自觉自愿的基础上，就会发挥出无穷的潜力。因而在实际上，完成的任务不是很慢，而是更快更好。今年春耕前，公社党委提出运送肥料实行车子化，任务很大，时间紧迫。支部接受这一任务后，并不是马上叫社员做车子，而是发动社员算了一笔用人畜搬运和车子搬运相对比的细帐，使社员认识到运输车子化的优越性，因而全体社员都积极地行动起来，在五天以内大造各种车辆八十四部。不仅按时完成了送粪的紧急任务，还节省了许多劳力用于麦田管理。
    他们做思想教育工作的方法，是灵活的，多种多样的。针对不同对象、不同情况，采用事实对比、活人活事、个别帮助与集体帮助相结合、表扬与批评相结合的方法进行教育。这些方法虽然不同，但都能收到很好的效果。对社员的一些思想问题，通常是用本村解放前后的生活变化和现实生活中某些事情的对比方法进行教育。例如，1958年征购粮食时，有的社员不愿多卖余粮，支部即用1929年的严重灾荒所遭受的苦难，与1957年遭受同样灾荒，但由于有了党的大力支援，顺利地渡过灾荒的这一事实对比，统一了社员的思想，完成了征购任务。群众的特点是“眼见是实”，有些问题只说明道理，还不易为群众理解，支部就采用典型人物和典型事例，叫社员亲眼看看，这样社员就容易心服口服。有一个生产小队副队长，生产有经验，但思想保守，支部就经常叫他参加经验交流会，参观先进技术展览。在这些活生生的事实教育下，他开阔了眼界，提高了认识，克服了保守思想，成为推广先进经验的积极分子。在卫生运动中，组织参观卫生模范单位，大家也就积极行动起来，很快赶上了模范单位。支部对党员和社员的教育，多注意个别帮助。但为了更好地帮助本人和教育群众，有时也采用集体帮助的办法，他们一般是当某个人的思想问题具有一定的代表性，或对错误认识不够，需要更多的力量帮助时，就采用会议形式，开展批评，由大家帮助，提高觉悟。
    健全的组织领导，周密的组织工作
    五十里铺党支部有党员十一人。支部很注意发挥党员的作用。在贯彻执行党的方针、政策和解决群众的生产、生活中的重大问题时，先在支委会进行研究，而后在全体党员中进行讨论，再通过各种形式贯彻到群众中去。这样，就能够首先统一党内思想，充分发挥党员的作用。有些紧急事情，在支委会研究后，就召开党员、团员、干部一揽子会议传达贯彻。为了使党员密切联系群众，支部对党员经常提出具体的要求。在平时，要求党员必须做好自己所担负的工作；同时要经常地了解群众的意见和要求，定期向支部反映；对群众进行宣传教育，解释党的政策；帮助群众解决困难和问题。在遇到困难的时候，要求党员更要起模范作用，用实际行动去影响和团结群众。党员联系群众和在群众中进行工作的方法是多种多样的。在平时，经常是按照居住区域，固定分工联系群众和进行活动。遇有紧急任务的时候，就要求党员利用一切机会和场合，了解群众的意见，向群众进行宣传解释工作。支部的领导干部也特别注意联系群众，了解群众的情况。
    支部还注意发挥团组织和队委会的作用。这个队有团员十四人。支部经常通过团组织给团员分配一定的工作任务，要求他们密切联系群众，宣传解释党的政策。在深翻土地、秋收秋种、田间管理、除四害讲卫生等工作中，注意发挥他们的突击作用，积极支持他们组织了
  “黄继光队”、“红姑娘队”来完成党交给的任务。在政治、文化学习方面，更要求他们起骨干作用。党支部对生产工作的领导，是通过生产队去实现的。有关生产计划，分配方案、财务收支、群众生活等问题，一般都是在党支部讨论决定后，再通过队委会或干部会，具体讨论和贯彻执行。
    支部善于计划和安排工作，并且注意检查计划的执行情况。支部根据每个时期的生产情况和各项工作任务，作出工作计划。在执行计划的过程中，又及时地加以具体安排，使长计划与短安排密切地结合起来。今春抗旱、整社、积肥、卫生、清仓等五项任务挤在一起，支部根据每项任务的特点和需要的人员，作了恰当的计划与安排。抗旱需要发动全体社员参加，就确定早上五点半至八点半，全体社员都到河里把冰背到山地里。整社也需要全体社员参加，就安排到晚上进行。积肥、卫生、清仓，都不需要全体社员参加，就确定专人负责，分别带领专业组在上下午进行。这样，两头集中活动，中间分头进行，各项任务都能按时完成，又不互相影响和牵扯。他们还注意一手抓生产，一手抓生活。在去年秋收紧张时期，支部特别注意对社员生活的安排。除强调要把托儿所、幼儿园的工作搞好以外，尤其注意办好食堂，保证社员吃得好，吃得饱。支部对生产工作，督促得紧，检查得严。特别注意对质量的检查。当发现有不合质量要求的，就要重做，决不马虎，而且由领导干部亲自参加，一直到做好为止。如种水稻时修的田埂，支部书记检查不合要求，就在他亲自参加下，重新做好。对各种专业人员的工作，都分别规定劳动定额和具体要求，按时检查执行情况。除进行现场检查外，还定期召开各种专业人员会议，帮助解决工作中的困难和问题。对各项工作，都根据检查结果，进行表扬、奖励或者批评。除领导检查外，还组织群众性的检查评比。支部还善于根据各个人的特点和工作的需要，恰当地使用干部，善于抓住时机和关键，合理地安排力量。毛主席说：领导者的责任，归结起来主要地是出主意、用干部这两件事。这个支部不仅主意出得好，而且也善于使用干部，发挥他们的长处。如生产队长善于管理社员生活和生产队的物资财产，就分工负责后勤和内务工作。副队长对生产有经验，能钻研，就分工抓生产。有的党员善于料理伙食，就派他到食堂工作。他们也特别注意加强重要岗位的人员配备。生产队的会计、出纳、炊事员、饲养员等，都是选拔忠实可靠而又能胜任工作的人员去担任。这样就使干部都各得其所，做好工作。支部在领导工作时，注意掌握时机，分别轻重缓急，恰当地安排使用力量，把力量集中使用在具有决定意义的方面。如去年秋，正当包谷成熟、急待收割时，又有炼钢铁的任务，因而劳力特别紧张，他们抓住收包谷这一
  “机不可失”的紧要关头，趁炼钢铁的劳力未走以前组织全部劳力首先把包谷收完藏好；在主要劳力调走以后，再把全队剩余的整半劳力和妇女儿童，重新调整组织，进行收割。结果不仅把粮食全部收回，而且把柴草也全部收回。
          群众路线的工作方法
    五十里铺党支部进行工作，注意与群众共同商量。如1958年公社化运动中，他们也曾把社员的猪、鸡、鸭等集中起来饲养。在一开始，支部就对社员说明集中饲养的好处，并且坚持自愿原则。经过群众讨论后，在自愿原则下，集中了一部分由队饲养。冬天，支部考虑到集体饲养，管理不好，容易出毛病，如有损失对群众不利，因而又与群众商量，决定可以领回自养，结果有的领回，有的愿意折价归队。这样做群众就比较满意。在推广先进经验和采取重大措施的时候，支部坚持放手发动群众，一切经过试验的办法，用群众的亲身体验，来教育群众。因而他们几年来所采用的新技术、新措施，都能顺利地推广起来，成效也很显著。如在推广包谷
  “金皇后”种子时，要四个小队各拿出三亩半土地进行试验，结果种了“金皇后”的三个队，都大大地增了产，而由于思想不通，仍坚持种老品种的一个队，产量却不高。这就教育了群众，注意推广优良品种。支部经常组织队与队之间、作业组与作业组之间，个人与个人之间的竞赛评比。如在大搞水土保持运动中，规定了各种作业的定额与质量标准，组织了各作业组之间的竞赛，仅挖鱼鳞坑一项，就提高工效两倍。在这项竞赛告一段落后，进行了认真的评比，对于优胜者给予了表扬。1958年组织的农业、副业、服务业、卫生等各项工作的竞赛评比，经过互相检查，现场参观和定期评比，大大地促进了各项工作的跃进。在年终进行了总结评比，评选出各方面的劳动模范和先进人物七十三人，为群众树立了榜样。这种树立旗帜，发扬先进，以先进带动落后的办法，有力地调动了一切积极因素，改变了工作中的某些薄弱环节和落后面貌。
    支部在领导工作中，特别注意虚心听取群众的意见，接受群众的批评，改进自己的思想作风，但是又不迁就群众，作群众的尾巴。去年播种包谷时，农业技术推广站要求“深沟，宽垅，密植”。但是，采用这种办法，在较短时期内完成大面积的播种，是有困难的。群众要求改变办法，支部接受了群众的意见，改为“犁沟、条播、点种”的方法，按时完成了任务，没有耽误农时。在进行深翻土地大协作时，有一部分群众存在本位主义思想，提出不去帮助别的生产队，支部没有接受这种意见，并且批判了这种错误思想，说明别人帮助我们深翻了土地，现在我们不帮助别人，是缺乏共产主义的协作精神。结果说服了群众，完成了协作任务。这种既能接受群众的正确意见，改进工作，又能纠正群众的错误意见，提高群众的觉悟，贯彻党的方针政策的做法，是真正体现了党的群众路线的原则的。
  支部领导干部经常访问群众，从生活方面给予关怀和帮助。他们常到敬老院探看老人，到军工属家里进行慰问。支部感到会议过多过长，影响社员的生产和休息，就设法减少会议，改进开会方法。会前作好准备，把一些要讲的内容集中起来，叫一个人讲，来缩短开会时间，春节聚餐时，干部叫炊事员休息，亲自给他们拿菜拿饭。社员有病时，就四处寻医取药。这种深切关心群众的精神，充分反映了他们高度的群众观念。
            坚强的领导核心
    为什么这个支部能够做出这样出色的工作呢？很重要的一个原因，就是支部有着坚强的领导核心。这个领导核心，经过各种斗争的考验和群众运动的锻炼，是从群众中生长起来的。支部书记何丙彦，从九岁起，连续给地主做了十二年长工，解放后在党的领导下，一开始就积极地参加了各种斗争，在斗争中具有鲜明的阶级立场，是斗争中的骨干。支部副书记兼副队长何有生，也给地主做过十二年长工，解放后积极参加各种斗争，带头组织互助组，在生产上能钻研，干劲大。支部委员兼队长何元生，贫农出身，善于当家。这个领导核心，近十年来，一直是团结一致，与群众的关系密切。他们具有共产党员全心全意为人民服务的思想和高尚的品德。他们办事公正，处处为集体的利益着想。如1957年年终分配，因为受灾，群众收入减少，支部书记就自动暂时少领应得的报酬，1958年又自动少领应得的补贴。他们作风民主，有事能同群众商量。他们处处以身作则，特别是参加劳动方面，堪称模范。如去年支部书记做劳动日一百五十六个，支部委员兼生产队长做劳动日一百三十四个，支部副书记兼副队长做劳动日二百四十一个，三人平均劳动日一百七十七个，占这个队平均劳动日的98.3％。近几个月来劳动得也不少。他们的工作作风踏踏实实，实事求是。
    这个领导核心，在上级党的领导下，依靠着全体党员，依靠着自己优良的思想品质和模范行为，团结带领着群众，群众也根据党组织出色的工作和他们的优良品德，把党组织和他们看作是可以信赖的领导者。这样，这个队真正做到了上下团结一致，内外团结一致，真正形成了既有民主，又有集中，既有自由，又有纪律，既有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅的局面，从而使全队的生产、工作取得了很大的成就。
