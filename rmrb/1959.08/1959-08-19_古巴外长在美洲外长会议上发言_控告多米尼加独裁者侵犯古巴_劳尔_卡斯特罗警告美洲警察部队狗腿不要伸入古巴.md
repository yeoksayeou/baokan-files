Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 17th: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa accused the Trujillo dictatorial regime of the Dominican Republic of aggression against Cuba today at the meeting of American foreign ministers.

Roa made the above accusation during the plenary session's discussion of the resolution on the issue of non-interference. He said that the causes of instability in the Caribbean region and the entire Americas are economic underdevelopment and aggression from the Trujillo dictatorship. He condemned the Dominican dictatorial regime for hiring Europeans and Asians to organize an army to invade Cuba and for creating difficulties for Cuba at this conference.

Dominican Foreign Minister Herrera denied Cuba's accusations at the meeting and regurgitated the so-called Cuban "invasion" of the Dominican Republic rumors previously promoted by American news agencies, counter-accusing Cuba.

Haitian Foreign Minister Mars also clamored at the meeting that his country had been "invaded." According to him, thirty people recently landed on the coast of his country and were immediately captured. Mars said he was not accusing anyone, but the "invaders" came from Cuba.

Cuban Foreign Minister Roa immediately pointed out that this was part of an anti-Cuban conspiracy, because it was true that some adventurers escaped the vigilance of the Cuban authorities and set off from Cuba with the aim of creating problems when the Santiago conference was held.

The meeting later passed a Chilean proposal that required the Organization of American States to "investigate" all accusations made by Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, August 17th: Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raúl Castro arrived here by plane on the 16th and made a statement to reporters here.

In response to reporters' questions, Raúl Castro said that Cuba had no interest in the Santiago conference or the Organization of American States. The Organization of American States is a useless organization that protects Trujillo and Somoza. The leader of the organization is a great power that insists on acting as the controller of all countries, which is precisely contrary to the principle of non-interference that it manipulates in every possible way.

When a reporter asked Raúl Castro whether he advocated Cuba's withdrawal from the Organization of American States, he replied, "I advocate the establishment of a League of Free American Nations without tyrants." In response to the draft on holding elections at the Santiago conference, Raúl Castro said that the revolution should not be suspended due to an incorrect understanding of legislative requirements. As long as the people are satisfied and the plan formulated on the basis of vivid reality is proceeding normally, there is no problem.

A reporter asked Raúl Castro whether the Cuban government would request the extradition of former dictator Batista. Raúl said, "No, we cannot waste time on these trivial matters. Those who once protected him in killing, looting, and stealing public wealth are still giving him the same assistance."

During his brief stay in Caracas, Raúl Castro met with Venezuelan President Rómulo Betancourt, senior Venezuelan government officials, and representatives of various political parties.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 17th: According to a report by Latin American News Agency, Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raúl Castro said while passing through Lima, the capital of Peru, on his way to Santiago on the 17th that "the actions of the Organization of American States are neither bright nor appropriate" and "it does not protect the interests of the Latin American people."

According to reports, Raúl Castro reiterated Cuba's opposition to the establishment of an Organization of American States police force while speaking to reporters in Caracas on the 16th. He said, "If any member of a police force extends a leg into Cuba, we will cut off his dog leg; if he extends his nose, we will cut off his nose. Cuba will never accept an international police force."

　　古巴外长在美洲外长会议上发言
　　控告多米尼加独裁者侵犯古巴
　　劳尔·卡斯特罗警告美洲警察部队狗腿不要伸入古巴
    据新华社圣地亚哥17日电　古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚今天在美洲外长会议上控告多米尼加的特鲁希略独裁政权侵犯古巴。
    罗亚是在全体会议讨论不干涉问题的决议案时提出以上控告的。他说，造成加勒比海地区和整个美洲的不安定局势的原因是经济不发达和来自特鲁希略独裁者的侵略。他谴责多米尼加独裁政权雇佣欧洲人和亚洲人组织侵略古巴的军队，并在这次会议上给古巴制造困难。
    多米尼加外交部长埃雷拉在会上抵赖古巴的指责，并重提过去由美国通讯社所宣传的所谓古巴“入侵”多米尼加的谣言，反咬古巴一口。
    海地外交部长马尔斯也在会上叫嚷他的国家遭到“入侵”。据他说，最近有三十个人在他的国家海岸登陆，随即被俘。马尔斯说他不指控任何人，但是“入侵者”来自古巴。
    古巴外交部长罗亚立即指出，这是反古巴阴谋的一部分，因为确实有些冒险分子逃过了古巴当局的警戒从古巴出发，其目的是要在圣地亚哥会议开会的时候制造问题。
    会议后来通过了智利的一项提案，这项提案要求美洲国家组织对古巴、多米尼加和海地三方面的指控，通通加以“调查”。
    据新华社加拉加斯17日电　古巴武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗16日乘飞机到达这里，他向这里的记者发表了谈话。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在回答记者问题时说，古巴对圣地亚哥会议和美洲国家组织没有任何兴趣，美洲国家组织是一个保护特鲁希略和索摩查的不起作用的机构。领导该机构的是一个大国，它执意以各国人民的支配者自居，这就恰恰违背了为它所百般搬弄的不干涉原则。
    当记者问劳尔·卡斯特罗是否主张古巴退出美洲国家组织时，他回答说，我主张成立没有暴君参加的美洲自由国家联盟。在回答圣地亚哥会议上关于举行选举的草案问题时，劳尔·卡斯特罗说，革命不应该由于对立法要求的不正确理解而中止，只要人民满意，只要那以生动的现实为基础所制订的计划在正常地进行，就没什么问题。
    一位记者问劳尔·卡斯特罗古巴政府是否会要求引渡前独裁者巴蒂斯塔。劳尔说，不，我们不能在这些琐碎的事情上浪费时间。曾经保护他杀人越货和盗窃公共财富的人现在还在给他以同样的援助。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗在加拉加斯短暂的逗留期间，会晤了委内瑞拉总统罗慕洛·贝坦科尔特，委内瑞拉政府高级官员和各政党的代表。
  据新华社哈瓦那17日电　据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，古巴武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗17日在前往圣地亚哥路经秘鲁首都利马时说，“美洲国家组织的所作所为既不光明、也不适当”，“它并不维护拉丁美洲人民的利益。”
    据报道，劳尔·卡斯特罗16日在加拉加斯对记者发表谈话时，重申了古巴反对建立美洲国家组织警察部队的立场。他说，“如果有任何一个警察部队的人员的腿伸入古巴，我们就斩断他的狗腿，他若是伸进鼻子我们就割掉他的鼻子。古巴永远也不接受国际警察部队。”
