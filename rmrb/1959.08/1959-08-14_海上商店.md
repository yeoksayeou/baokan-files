　　Floating Stores
    The Zhapo Port Store in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, has organized seven wooden sailboats to establish "Floating Stores" to support fishermen's production, following the fishermen as they move north and south. Wherever the fishermen produce, the stores purchase their catch, and also deliver large quantities of fishing nets, rice, salt, and other supplies to the fishing boats.

    In the first half of this year, they supplied goods worth 20,000 yuan to fishing grounds in Hainan Island, Shadi, Beihai City, and other places, while also purchasing and transporting nearly 400,000 jin of fish. (Jiang Juntiao)

　　海上商店
    广东省两阳县闸坡港商店为支援渔民生产，组织了七艘木帆船，设立“海上商店”，跟随渔民转战南北。渔民生产到哪里，就收购到哪里，并且把大批渔网、大米、食盐等输送给渔船。
    今年上半年，他们到海南岛、沙堤、北海市等地渔场上供应了价值二万元的物资，同时收购、运输鱼货近四十万斤。（江俊桃）
