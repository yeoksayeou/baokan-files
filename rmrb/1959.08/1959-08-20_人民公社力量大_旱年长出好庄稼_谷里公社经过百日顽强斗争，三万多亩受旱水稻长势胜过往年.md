Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 19th - The Guli People's Commune in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, after a hundred days of heroic and tenacious struggle against drought, has seen large areas of drought-affected rice grow vigorously, surpassing any previous year. The superiority of the People's Commune, like the morning glow of spring, radiates a brilliant light. The commune members boast:
	"The People's Commune has great strength; good harvests grow in a drought year!"
	The Guli People's Commune is located in a semi-hilly and semi-mountainous area surrounded by mountains, with most of the land being "terrace" fields. People used to describe it as: "A small drought after three days without rain, a major drought after seven days without rain." After vigorously developing farmland water conservancy last winter and this spring, irrigation conditions have greatly changed, but due to only a few light rains in more than three months, with rainfall of only 30 millimeters, the drought situation developed quite seriously. The early onset of drought, the long duration of drought, and the large area affected by drought are unprecedented in this area for a century. Despite this, the heroic people of the Guli Commune have achieved very encouraging results in the long-term struggle against drought. Of the 44,000 mu of rice planted by the entire commune, 38,000 mu are growing better than any year before. These rice fields are large and contiguous, most of which have already headed, some have already filled, and some are filling, with the fragrance of rice flowers spreading for miles in the wind. 3,500 mu of non-contiguous rice fields are growing slightly worse than last year due to extremely difficult water sources. Only 2,500 mu of scattered small "mountain-side" rice fields on the mountain ridges have withered due to the exhaustion of water sources.
	In this prolonged and large-scale struggle against drought, the cadres and masses of the Guli People's Commune put forward the resounding slogan of "Fight drought until the sky bows its head, protect seedlings until grain enters the barn." The entire commune mobilized more than 7,000 laborers, 16 water pumps, and 825 waterwheels, with a strong will to conquer nature, braving the heat, working day and night to draw water for drought resistance. The morale grew stronger with each battle, and the enthusiasm increased with each drumbeat. The commune members adopted the method of "no water in the pond, draw from the dam; no water in the dam, draw from the river; no water in the river, draw from the Yangtze River," drawing water step by step. First, they pumped dry 270 small ponds, and then pumped dry 300 large ponds. After the large and small ponds were dried, they set up one or twenty waterwheels, stretching for two or three kilometers, building dams and drawing water from dams and rivers for irrigation. Some of the dams and canals draw water from the Yangtze River. In late July, the water level of the Yangtze River suddenly dropped to 5.9 meters, and the riverbed was one meter higher than the Yangtze River's surface, making it impossible to draw water from the river, creating extreme difficulties for water sources. However, the commune members put forward the slogans of "As long as the Yangtze River doesn't dry up, we will definitely get the river water up the mountain," "Take the Yangtze River as a water ladle, irrigate wherever there is drought," and "Even if we pump the Yangtze River dry, we must ensure a good harvest," with the heroic spirit of turning the river upside down, and the energy of subduing dragons and tigers, to draw Yangtze River water up the mountain. They cooperated with the Banqiao People's Commune near the river, building dams and drawing water, setting up more than 30 waterwheels, passing over 15 kilometers of rivers and dams, crossing more than 30 dam heads and ten mountain ridges. The surging Yangtze River, under the control of the heroes, followed the "horn" of more than a dozen water pump machines, passed through waterwheels and dams, climbed mountains and ridges, and obediently flowed into the drought-affected rice fields, irrigating more than 20,000 mu of rice.
	Under the unified leadership of the commune, all production teams carried out extensive cooperation in labor, tools, and water sources based on the principle of equal value exchange and mutual benefit. This effectively ensured the smooth development of the drought resistance struggle. The Danzhuang production team had 185 mu of rice in the mountains, and it required 136 laborers, 11 waterwheels, and crossing two mountain ridges to draw water from the foot of the mountain. However, the entire production team only had 80 laborers. At this time, the commune transferred more than 40 laborers and four waterwheels from the Xiaowei and Baifenqiang production teams to cooperate in drawing water, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient labor and tools in this production team. When the water level of the Yangtze River dropped rapidly, in order to seize the opportunity to store tidal water, the commune uniformly organized more than 600 people, and after six hours of intensive damming, they stored 100,000 cubic meters of tidal water.
	The people's communization has brought new changes in the relationships between people. In the struggle against drought, the commune members helped each other in times of difficulty, leaving the difficulties to themselves and giving convenience to others, demonstrating a noble communist spirit. The Huagang Brigade and the Xinming Brigade originally shared the water stored in the Zhangjiashang Dam. The Xinming Brigade had greater difficulties with water sources, while the Huagang Brigade had more convenient access to water. After discussion by the commune members, the Huagang Brigade voluntarily gave all the water stored in the Zhangjiashang Dam to the Xinming Brigade, and organized more than 300 laborers to set up two or three waterwheels and draw water from the Zhangjiaxia Dam for irrigation. This new spiritual outlook further inspired the fighting spirit of the vast number of commune members to overcome disasters.
	While drawing water for drought resistance, the Guli People's Commune also paid attention to strengthening field management of rice. They adopted methods such as organizing labor to draw water for drought resistance, and auxiliary labor to control pests and weeds, so that the rice fields were well managed. More than 40,000 mu of rice in the entire commune were generally top-dressed two to three times, with 20 to 35 dan of human manure applied per mu, weeds were generally hoed three to four times, and pests were controlled twice, ensuring the normal growth of rice seedlings.
	Recently, the Guli People's Commune Party Committee further mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate a long-term drought resistance plan from now until the rice harvest. Cadres at all levels and the masses, after assessing the seedlings, water sources, and conditions, are full of confidence and are working with redoubled efforts to ensure that the average yield per mu of the 38,000 mu of rice that are growing well increases by 20% compared to last year, strive to preserve the 3,500 mu of severely drought-affected rice and achieve a harvest, and strive to increase the total output this autumn by more than 10% compared to last year.

    人民公社力量大　旱年长出好庄稼
　　谷里公社经过百日顽强斗争，三万多亩受旱水稻长势胜过往年
    据新华社南京19日电　江苏省江宁县谷里人民公社经过一百天英勇顽强的抗旱斗争，大片大片受旱的水稻生长旺盛，长势胜过以往任何一年。人民公社的优越性，像春天的朝霞一样，发出一片光辉。社员们夸耀说：
  “人民公社力量大，旱年长出了好庄稼！”
    谷里人民公社处在一个群山环抱的半丘半山地区，大部分是“楼梯”田，人们过去形容这里是：“三天不雨小旱，七天不雨大旱”。去冬今春大力兴修农田水利以后，灌溉条件有了很大变化，但是终因三个多月只下几次小雨，降雨量只有三十多毫米，旱情发展得相当严重。旱得早，旱的时间长，受旱面积大，这是这个地区百年来所未有的。尽管如此，英雄的谷里公社人民，在长期的抗旱斗争中却取得了十分振奋人心的成绩。全公社栽插的四万四千亩水稻中，有三万八千亩生长得比哪一年都好。这些水稻都是成片的大田，大部分已经抽穗，有的已经灌浆和正在灌浆，风吹稻花，十里飘香。有三千五百亩不成片的水稻，因为水源十分困难，长势稍次于去年。只有二千五百亩山岗上的零星小块“山膀子”田的水稻，因水源断绝而干枯。
    在这一场持久的大规模的抗旱斗争中，谷里人民公社干部和群众提出了“抗旱抗到天低头，保苗保到谷进仓”的响亮口号。全公社出动了七千多劳动力，十六部抽水机，八百二十五部水车，以人定胜天的坚强意志，冒着酷热，披星戴月，歇人不歇车，夜以继日地车水抗旱。士气越战越旺，干劲越鼓越足。社员们采取“塘里无水坝里盘，坝里无水河里盘，河里无水车长江”的节节盘水办法，先车干了二百七十个小塘，又车干了三百个大塘。大塘、小塘车干以后，就架起一、二十道水车，绵长两三公里，从坝渠和大河里筑坝盘水灌溉。有一部分坝渠是从长江进水的，7月下旬长江水位突然下降到五点九米，河底比长江水面高了一米，江水引不进，水源发生极大困难。但是社员们提出了“只要长江水不干，定叫江水搬上山”、“拿起长江当水瓢，哪里有旱哪里浇”、“车干长江水，也要保丰收”的口号，以翻江倒海的英雄气概，降龙伏虎的劲头，盘引江水上山。他们同临近江边的板桥人民公社通力协作，筑坝盘水，架起三十多道水车，盘过十五公里长的大河和坝渠，翻过三十多条坝头和十多个山岗，滚滚东流的江水，在英雄们的驾驶下，顺着十几台抽水机水泵的“喇叭”口，通过一道道水车，一段段坝头，翻山越岭，顺从地流进受旱的稻田，使两万多亩水稻得到了灌溉。
    在公社的统一领导下，各个生产队都在等价互利的原则下，在劳力、工具、水源等方面进行了广泛的协作。有效地保证了抗旱斗争的顺利开展。淡庄生产队有一百八十五亩水稻在山里面，从山下盘水上去需要一百三十六个劳动力，架十一道水车，翻两个山岗，而这个生产队全部劳动力却只有八十个。这时，公社从小圩、白粉墙两个生产队调来了四十多个劳力、四部水车，协作盘水，克服了这个生产队劳力、工具不足的困难。在长江水位迅速下降时，为了抢蓄潮水，公社统一组织了六百多人，经过六小时突击打坝，就拦蓄了十万立方米的潮水。
    人民公社化，给人们带来了人与人之间关系的新的变化。社员们在抗旱斗争中患难相扶，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，表现出了高尚的共产主义精神。花岗大队和新明大队原来都合用张家上坝蓄的水，新明大队水源困难大，花岗大队取水比较方便。花岗大队经过社员讨论，主动将张家上坝的蓄水全部让给新明大队，自己组织三百多个劳动力，架起两三道水车，到张家下坝盘水灌溉。这种新的精神面貌，进一步激励了广大社员抗灾必胜的斗争情绪。
    谷里人民公社在车水抗旱的同时，并注意了加强水稻的田间管理。他们采取整劳力车水抗旱，辅助劳力治虫、锄草等方法，稻田管理得很好。全公社四万多亩水稻普遍追肥两次到三次，每亩追施人粪尿二十担到三十五担，普遍锄草三次到四次，治虫两次，保证了稻苗的正常生长。
    最近，谷里人民公社党委又进一步发动群众讨论和制订了从现在起到稻谷登场为止的长期抗旱计划。各级干部和群众经过排留苗、排水源、排条件，都充满了信心，以百倍干劲确保生长好的三万八千亩水稻平均亩产比去年增加两成，争取保住受旱严重的三千五百亩水稻有收成，力争今年秋季总产量比去年增产一成以上。
