Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 31st. Chongqing Steel Company's steel rolling workers, in order to support the mechanization of transportation in coal mines across the country, successfully trial-rolled a new Soviet-style eight-kilogram light rail and officially put it into production on the 30th.

The eight-kilogram light rail trial-rolled by Chongqing Steel Company is complex in form and requires high standards in design, equipment, and technical operations. During the trial rolling process, after research, the workers reduced the number of passes on the rolling mill by two, and also increased the reduction, thereby greatly improving labor productivity. The daily output was four tons higher than their previous rolling of ordinary eight-kilogram light rail, and the quality fully met the standards. More than one hundred kilograms of steel were also saved per ton of light rail.

    重钢试轧成功轻轨支援煤矿生产
    新华社重庆31日电　重庆钢铁公司轧钢工人为支援各地煤矿大搞机械化运输，试轧成功一种苏联新式八公斤轻轨，并在30日将这种轻轨正式投入生产。
    重庆钢铁公司试轧成功的这种八公斤轻轨型式复杂，在设计、设备和技术操作等方面要求都很高。在试轧过程中，职工们经过研究，将轧钢机减少了两个孔型，同时还增大了下压量，因此大大提高了劳动生产率，每日产量比他们过去轧制一般八公斤轻轨提高了四吨，质量完全合乎标准。每吨轻轨还节约钢材一百多公斤。
