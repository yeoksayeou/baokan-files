　　The Beijing Factory, Mine and Construction Enterprise Workers' Spare-Time Cultural Work Conference Calls:
　　Take up Cultural Weapons to Oppose Rightism and Encourage Vigor
　　(Our report) The Beijing Municipal Factory, Mine, and Construction Enterprise Workers' Spare-Time Cultural Work Conference held on the 17th called on all city workers to vigorously carry out propaganda and cultural entertainment activities in coordination with the booming production upsurge, and joyfully welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.
　　This conference was convened by the Cultural Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The conference requested that all factories, mines, and construction enterprises closely cooperate with the current struggle against right-leaning conservative thought and the new upsurge of the increase production and practice economy movement. They should actively carry out amateur cultural activities to enable all workers to be full of energy, engage in large-scale production, and joyfully welcome the National Day regardless of gender, age. The conference hoped that all units, based on their specific circumstances, would mobilize workers who are capable of writing to engage in amateur writing, use various forms to carry out propaganda and cultural entertainment activities, sing the praises of the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, sing the praises of the great leap forward in production, commend advanced figures and advanced deeds, raise the ideological awareness of workers, and oppose all kinds of conservative ideas and slackening emotions; at the same time, the conference hoped that the workers would receive proper cultural entertainment, live more happily, and thus be more energetic in production.
　　At this conference, representatives from Beijing Xingping Machinery Factory, known for its regularized spare-time cultural activities; Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, which has done a good job in carrying out mass cultural and recreational activities; and Beijing Instrument Factory, which can regularly carry out cultural activities under relatively poor material conditions, introduced their experiences.
　　The conference pointed out that in the past year, the spare-time cultural activities of workers in Beijing's factories, mines, and construction sites, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, adhered to the policy of serving politics and serving socialist construction, and followed the mass line in their work, thus achieving a great leap forward. The scale, momentum, and depth of cultural activities have all developed. The main characteristic of the current spare-time cultural work of workers in Beijing is that the work is becoming more and more widespread, in-depth, and normalized. The conference pointed out that the main problem at present is that the leadership of a small number of factories and mines does not pay enough attention to this work, lacks regular and systematic leadership, cultural activities are not extensive and in-depth enough, and they have not actively attracted a wider range of workers to participate; the professional cultural units have not provided enough assistance to them. The conference believes that, according to the experience of the past year, the spare-time cultural work of factory and mine workers must closely cooperate with production and central work, adhere to the principle of voluntary participation in spare time, give full play to the creativity and initiative of the masses, let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new, be flexible and diverse, and carry out activities that are popular with workers in accordance with local conditions and times; the forms and methods of cultural activities should be diversified, combining large, medium, and small scales, with medium and small scales as the main focus at present. The performance of large-scale plays should be based on needs and possibilities. Large-scale plays should not be completely rejected, but there should not be too many; attention should be paid to gradually improving the quality of activities, penetrating into every corner of workers' lives, insisting on normalization, so that as many workers as possible can enjoy cultural life, and manage affairs diligently and thriftily. The Party committees of various factory and mining enterprises should strengthen the unified leadership and arrangements for workers' spare-time cultural activities to ensure that workers' spare-time cultural activities are carried out regularly and healthily.
　　According to statistics in June of this year, there are more than 5,000 workers' spare-time cultural activity organizations in Beijing's factories and mines, and more than 2,200 workshop and department clubs and libraries. The number of workers who regularly participate in activities has increased from more than 50,000 in 1958 to more than 90,000 at present. More than half of the units can carry out activities more regularly. In addition to carrying out propaganda activities and artistic performances in coordination with production and central work, many factories and mines have also carried out meaningful and diverse cultural and recreational activities such as "weekend cool-off evening parties," "night parks," "small sky bridges," "small temple fairs," and "amusement tea houses," which are welcomed by the majority of workers. Many factories decentralize cultural activities to workshops and carry out activities such as "books to dormitories" to facilitate workers as much as possible. In addition to the factory-wide library, Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory also has 20 dormitory libraries that can accommodate more than 1,500 workers to read. Around National Day, many factories and mines will hold artistic performances and Great Leap Forward exhibitions, as well as broadcast meetings. Xingping Machinery Factory and other units are also preparing to exhibit workers' spare-time artistic creations. Now, many factories and mines have taken active action. (Attached picture)

　　北京厂矿和建筑企业职工业余文化工作会议号召
　　拿起文化武器反右倾鼓干劲
    本报讯　17日举行的北京市属厂矿、建筑企业职工业余文化工作会议，号召全市职工配合轰轰烈烈的生产高潮，大力开展宣传鼓动和文化娱乐活动，欢天喜地迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    这次会议是由中共北京市委文化部召开的。会议要求各厂矿、建筑企业单位，密切配合当前反右倾保守思想的斗争和增产节约运动的新高潮，积极开展业余文化活动，使全体职工鼓足干劲，大搞生产，男女老少欢天喜地迎国庆。会议希望各单位根据具体情况，在可能条件下发动能够写作的职工进行业余写作，利用各种形式进行宣传鼓动和文化娱乐活动，歌颂党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，歌颂生产大跃进，表扬先进人物和先进事迹，提高职工思想觉悟，反对形形色色的保守思想和松劲情绪；同时，使职工群众得到正当的文化娱乐，生活得更加愉快，从而在生产上干劲更加充沛。
    在这次会议上，以职工业余文化活动经常化著称的北京兴平机械厂、开展群众性文娱活动较好的北京棉纺三厂、能在较差的物质条件下经常开展文化活动的北京仪表厂等单位的代表介绍了经验。
    会议指出，一年以来，北京厂矿、建筑工地的职工业余文化活动，在各级党委领导下，坚持了为政治服务、为社会主义建设服务的方针，在工作中走群众路线，因而有了很大的跃进。文化活动的规模、声势和深度都有了发展。当前北京市职工业余文化工作的主要特点，是工作的开展越来越趋向广泛、深入和正常化。会议指出，目前的主要问题是一小部分厂矿的领导上对于这个工作重视不够，缺乏经常的系统的领导，文化活动不够广泛和深入，没有积极吸引更广大的职工参加；专业文化单位对它们的帮助也还不够。会议认为，根据一年来的经验，厂矿职工业余文化工作，必须密切配合生产和中心工作，坚持业余自愿的原则，充分发挥群众的创造性和积极性，百花齐放，推陈出新，灵活多样，因地因时制宜地开展为职工喜见乐闻的活动；文化活动的形式和方式要多样化，要大、中、小结合，目前应以中、小型为主，排演大戏要根据需要和可能，对大戏不要一律排斥，但不能太多；要注意逐步提高活动质量，深入到职工生活的各个角落，坚持正常化，使尽可能多的职工能够享受文化生活，并且勤俭办事。各厂矿企业部门的党委应当加强对职工业余文化活动的统一领导和安排，以保证职工业余文化活动经常地、健康地开展。
    据今年6月份统计，北京市各厂矿中，有职工业余文化活动组织五千多个，车间、科室俱乐部和图书室共二千二百多所，经常参加活动的职工已经由1958年的五万多人增加到目前的九万多人，半数以上的单位都能比较经常地开展活动。许多厂矿除配合生产和中心工作进行宣传活动和文艺演出以外，还开展了“周末乘凉晚会”、“夜公园”、“小天桥”、“小庙会”、“游艺茶座”等有意义的、多种多样的文化娱乐活动，受到广大职工的欢迎。许多工厂把文化活动下放到车间，并开展“图书下宿舍”等活动，尽可能便利职工。北京棉纺三厂除全厂性图书馆外，还有二十个宿舍图书馆，能容纳一千五百多名工人读书。国庆前后，许多厂矿将举行文艺会演和大跃进展览以及广播会等。兴平机械厂等单位还准备展览职工业余文艺创作。现在，许多厂矿已积极行动起来。（附图片）
