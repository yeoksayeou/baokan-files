Seize the Key Season to Produce More Oil
　　Petroleum Industry Department calls for improving oil extraction rate, refining rate, and transportation efficiency
    (Our newspaper reports) The Ministry of Petroleum Industry recently held a telephone conference, calling on all natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum enterprises, as well as all refineries, basic construction units, and transportation departments, to seize August and September, and on the basis of ensuring quality, quickly launch a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on improving oil extraction rate, refining rate, and crude oil transportation, so as to comprehensively fulfill the national plan.
    The conference pointed out that the achievements on the petroleum industry front in the first half of this year were very great, maintaining the speed of the Great Leap Forward. Crude oil production increased by 74.6% compared to the same period last year, the highest growth rate in history; gasoline production increased by 30%, and diesel by 67.8%; the workload of basic construction increased by 45.5% compared to the same period last year; the quality of various products generally met the standards, and the quality of some products improved.
    The conference believes that there are many favorable conditions for the continued leap forward of the petroleum industry in the second half of the year: the basic construction projects of many enterprises have been completed or are nearing completion, and production capacity will be further improved; the original equipment still has great potential; the supply of equipment and materials will be further improved; especially, the vast number of workers and masses have great enthusiasm and strong will; and August and September are good seasons for production and basic construction. Therefore, the conference emphasized that August and September are the key seasons for the petroleum industry, and it is necessary to seize the favorable situation and various favorable conditions, forge ahead bravely, work hard, and launch a new production upsurge. The conference called on petroleum industrial enterprises across the country to immediately mobilize the masses, carry out "four comparisons" (compare output, compare quality, compare enthusiasm, compare measures), and create a hot red flag emulation campaign. At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the right-leaning and slackening mood of some cadres, further boost morale, strive for excellence, and base the vigorous production movement on an in-depth and meticulous ideological movement, so as to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill this year's petroleum industry production tasks.
    The conference believes that the key to increasing production in the petroleum industry at present is to strengthen oil well management and oil well maintenance, and improve the level of crude oil production; implement rapid drilling on the basis of high quality, and rapidly increase crude oil production capacity; improve the refining rate of synthetic and natural petroleum refining, and reduce raw material consumption; strengthen equipment maintenance, improve equipment utilization, and prepare for winter insulation; strengthen transportation, improve vehicle utilization rate and vehicle tonnage utilization rate, and improve the external transportation of crude oil in natural oil mining areas; inventory warehouses, use all useful equipment and materials for production, and strengthen internal balance and scheduling and mutual support between enterprises; and accelerate the construction progress of basic construction projects on the premise of resolutely implementing shortening the battle line, concentrating forces to ensure key projects and ensuring project quality.
    In order to better complete the production tasks of the petroleum industry, the conference pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen enterprise management. At present, it is especially necessary to strengthen plan management in enterprises and cost accounting in production; adjust management institutions, improve labor organization, and improve labor productivity; establish and improve rules and regulations, first of all, improve the quality inspection system to normalize production; strengthen safety work from the aspects of systems and technical education, and achieve safe production.
    The responsible cadres of each factory and mine who participated in the meeting unanimously expressed that they would take immediate action, fight hard in August and September, create new achievements, and welcome National Day.

　　抓紧关键季节多产石油
　　石油工业部号召提高采油率、炼率和运输效率
    本报讯　石油工业部最近召开电话会议，号召各天然石油和人造石油企业以及各炼厂、基本建设单位、运输部门，抓紧8、9两月，在保证质量的基础上，迅速掀起一个以提高采油率、炼率和原油运输为中心的增产节约运动新高潮，全面完成国家计划。
    会议指出，今年上半年石油工业战线上的成绩是很大的，保持了大跃进的速度。原油产量比去年同期增长了74.6％，是历年来最高的增长速度；汽油的产量增长30％，柴油增长67.8％；基本建设工作量比去年同期增加45.5％；各项产品的质量一般都合乎标准，部分产品的质量有所提高。
    会议认为，下半年石油工业继续跃进有很多有利条件：许多企业的基本建设工程已经完成和接近完成，生产能力将进一步提高；原有设备还有很大潜力；器材设备的供应将进一步改善；特别是广大职工群众干劲很足，意志旺盛；8、9两月又是生产和基本建设的良好季节。因此，会议强调指出，8、9两月是石油工业的关键季节，必须切实抓住有利形势和各种有利条件，勇往直前，大干特干，掀起一个新的生产高潮。会议号召全国石油工业企业立即深入发动群众，开展“四比”（比产量，比质量，比干劲，比措施），使红旗竞赛运动形成热潮。同时，必须坚决反对一部分干部的右倾松劲情绪，进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，把热火朝天的生产运动建立在深入细致的思想运动的基础上，以便全面完成和超额完成今年石油工业的生产任务。
    会议认为，当前石油工业增加生产的关键是：加强油井管理和油井的维修工作，提高原油的生产水平；在优质的基础上实行快速钻井，迅速增加原油生产能力；提高人造石油和天然石油炼制的炼率，降低原材料消耗；加强设备维修工作，提高设备利用率，并要作好冬季保温的准备工作；加强运输工作，提高出车率和车辆吨位利用率，改善天然油矿区原油外运情况；清查仓库，把一切有用的器材物资用到生产上去，并且加强内部的平衡调度和企业间的互相支援；在坚决贯彻缩短战线，集中力量确保重点工程和保证工程质量的条件下，加速基本建设工程的施工进度。
    为了更好地完成石油工业的生产任务，会议指出，必须加强企业管理工作。目前特别要加强企业中的计划管理和生产中的成本核算；调整管理机构，改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率；建立和健全规章制度，首先要健全质量检查制度，使生产正常化；从制度方面和技术教育方面加强安全工作，实现安全生产。
    参加会议的各厂、矿负责干部一致表示要立即行动起来，大战8、9月，创造新成绩，迎接国庆节。
