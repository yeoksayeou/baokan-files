(Report from Nanjing, August 18) A massive mass movement of "establishing model workers, learning from model workers, and catching up with model workers" has been fully launched in the state-owned commercial system of Jiangsu Province. In the past two months, the state-owned commercial system of this province has established more than 750 various advanced unit model workers and more than 9,200 advanced individual model workers. Many areas have achieved a situation where there are model workers in every industry, at every level, and in everything, setting off a competition craze in which everyone looks for opponents and everyone learns from model workers. A new situation has emerged in the work of the commercial departments.
　　This kind of "model worker" competition was first launched by the No. 2 Non-Staple Food Store in Wuxi City. More than 90,000 employees in the state-owned commercial system of the province have successively learned from Wuxi's experience and participated in the model worker competition. In the first month of the competition in Yancheng Special District, the supply plan was completed by 117%, and the procurement plan was exceeded by 25%. After Shangzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yancheng County was established as a collective model worker for overfulfilling the live pig procurement task every month, other supply and marketing cooperatives quickly caught up and actively learned from Shangzhuang's procurement experience; Bufeng, Xinxing, Dagang and other eleven supply and marketing cooperatives have caught up with Shangzhuang, and have recently continuously overfulfilled the task of pig procurement. After the catering industry in Xuzhou City established advanced model workers according to work types, in less than a month, the variety of dishes supplied daily by restaurants in the city increased from more than ten to more than forty, and they were also inexpensive, delicious, economical, affordable, served promptly, and the service was warm. The province's various industries have received more than 16,550 written commendations from customers recently.
　　Through the model worker competition, some people who were originally lacking enthusiasm have also become active. After Bacheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Kunshan County established thirteen individual model workers, all employees learned from model workers; according to the inspection and assessment at the end of July, 28 people have reached the level of model workers, accounting for 12.6% of the number of participants, and 169 people are about to catch up with the model workers, accounting for 77.5% of the number of participants. In areas where the movement has been carried out well, new atmospheres of "five mores and five lesses" have emerged: more advanced, less backward; more mutual help, less mutual secrecy; more promotion of advanced experience, less unwillingness to learn from advanced experience; more good news of completing tasks ahead of schedule, less willingness to stay behind; more customer commendations, less criticisms. (Zhou Minglang)
    (Report from Shanghai, August 18) Hundreds of thousands of commercial employees in Shanghai are vigorously carrying out a mass movement centered on striving for further improvement in market conditions, and are doing a good job in supply and service by vigorously organizing sources of goods and actively arranging the market, using a two-pronged approach.
　　On the procurement front, employees are actively and proactively doing a good job in industrial-commercial collaboration and agricultural-commercial collaboration, and are trying every possible means to expand sources of goods. The First Commercial Bureau and the Light Industry Bureau recently jointly held counterpart meetings attended by relevant professional companies and commercial procurement and supply stations to further arrange production in the third quarter, conduct careful review and adjustment of 392 kinds of products, and implement the variety, specifications and quantity plans to the factories. Many commercial personnel actively assist industrial departments in solving raw material problems. The black iron sheets needed by enamel factories used to rely on imports. Employees of the Department Store Procurement and Supply Station studied with the leaders of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 and helped them trial-produce 23 tons of black iron sheets, opening up a new source of raw materials for enamel products. Waste product recovery work has also been further strengthened. Since July, the city has recovered more than 10,000 tons of waste paper. The liaison officers of Shanghai Vegetable and Fruit Company in the suburbs have helped farmers solve many problems in terms of seeds, tools, etc.
　　Shanghai's commercial departments have also grasped the procurement work in other places. The First Commercial Bureau sent five visiting groups to eight provinces and cities including Shandong and Fujian to purchase various raw materials, local specialties and small handicraft commodities. The employees who purchased non-staple foods in Yunnan, Guizhou and other places also assisted the local people in pickling bacon in summer to supply Shanghai's needs in a timely manner.
　　In terms of market arrangements, employees proposed not only to improve service attitude and improve service quality, but also to try every possible means to expand the variety of designs and colors and promote traditional business characteristics. At the recent city-wide meeting of activists from major street shops, many shops put forward specific goals for August and September. Many famous shops on Nanjing Road have restored and strengthened their own workshops and are designing novel clothing, shoes, etc. to make people look more beautiful on the National Day holiday.
　　Service quality is being further improved, and is the goal of Shanghai's catering service personnel. Industries such as catering, hairdressing, dyeing and laundry, and photography have held experience exchange meetings respectively, and skilled experts have shown their talents and performed live demonstrations.
　　While arranging the Shanghai market, Shanghai's commercial departments have transferred a large amount of materials to support the peak season markets and National Day needs in various places. Since August, an average of more than 3,000 tons of knitwear, cotton cloth, cultural supplies, etc. have been shipped out of Shanghai every day.

    江苏商业系统开展群众运动改进购销业务
　　上万标兵带头　竞赛如火如荼
　　上海商业职工千方百计扩大货源提高服务质量
    本报南京18日电　一个声势浩大的“立标兵、学标兵、赶标兵”的群众运动，在江苏省国营商业系统全面展开。这个省的国营商业系统两个多月来已经树立起各种先进单位标兵七百五十多个，先进个人标兵九千二百多人。许多地区达到行行有标兵、层层有标兵、事事有标兵，掀起了人人找对手、个个学标兵的竞赛热潮。商业部门的工作出现了新局面。
    这种“标兵”竞赛是无锡市第二副食品商店首先开展起来的。全省九万多名国营商业系统的职工先后学习无锡的经验，投入了标兵竞赛。盐城专区开展竞赛的第一个月，供应计划完成117％，采购计划超额25％。盐城县树立了尚庄供销部月月超额完成生猪收购任务的集体标兵以后，其他供销部都急起直追，积极学习尚庄的收购经验；步风、新兴、大岗等十一个供销部赶上了尚庄，最近都连续超额完成了收猪任务。徐州市饮食业按工种树立起先进标兵以后，不到一个月时间，全市菜馆日常供应的菜肴品种就从十多种增加到四十多种，并且做到价廉味美，经济实惠，随到随吃，招待热情。这个省各个行业最近期间共得到顾客书面表扬一万六千五百五十多件。
    通过标兵竞赛，一些原来干劲不足的人也积极了。昆山县巴城供销部树立了十三个个人标兵以后，全体职工人人学标兵；据7月底检查鉴定，已经赶上标兵水平的有二十八人，占参加竞赛人数的12.6％，即将赶上标兵的有一百六十九人，占参加竞赛人数的77.5％。凡是运动搞得好的地区，都出现了“五多、五少”的新气象：先进的增多，落后的减少；相互帮助的多，互不通气的少；先进经验推广多，不想学习先进经验的少；提前完成任务报喜多，甘居下游的少；顾客表扬意见多，批评意见少。　（周明朗）
    本报上海18日电　上海市几十万商业职工正在轰轰烈烈地开展以力争市场情况进一步好转为中心的群众运动，通过大力组织货源，积极安排市场，双管齐下做好供应服务工作。
    在采购战线上，职工们积极主动地搞好工商协作和农商协作，千方百计扩大货源。第一商业局和轻工业局最近联合举行了各有关专业公司和商业采购供应站参加的对口会议，进一步安排第三季度生产，对三百九十二种产品进行认真的审查和调整，使品种、规格和数量计划落实到厂。许多商业人员积极协助工业部门解决原材料问题。搪瓷厂需要的黑铁皮过去靠进口，百货采购供应站的职工与上钢三厂领导方面研究，协助他们试制出二十三吨黑铁皮，开辟了搪瓷品原料的新来源。废品回收工作也进一步加强了。7月份以来，全市回收的废纸就在一万吨以上。上海蔬菜果品公司在郊区的联络员，帮助农民解决了许多种子、工具等方面的问题。
    上海商业部门也抓紧了在外地的采购工作。第一商业局派出五个访问组，分赴山东、福建等八个省市，采购各种原材料、土特产和手工业小商品。在云南、贵州等地采购副食品的职工还协助当地在夏天腌制腊肉，及时供应上海的需要。
    在安排市场方面，职工们提出不仅要改善服务态度，提高服务质量，而且要千方百计扩大花色品种，发扬传统的经营特色。在最近召开的全市主要街道商店活动分子大会上，许多商店提出了8、9两月的具体努力目标。南京路上不少著名商店恢复和加强了自设工场，正在设计新颖的服装、鞋子等，让人们在国庆节日穿戴得更漂亮。
    服务质量更上一层楼，是上海饮食服务人员的奋斗目标。饮食、理发、洗染、照相等行业分别举行了经验交流会，具有专长的能手各显神通，作了现场表演。
    上海商业部门在安排上海市场的同时，调集了大批物资，支援各地旺季市场和国庆需要。8月份以来，每天平均有三千多吨针棉织品、棉布、文化用品等从上海运出。
