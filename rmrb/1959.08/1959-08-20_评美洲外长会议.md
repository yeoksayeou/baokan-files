　　Comment on the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers
　　By a staff commentator
    The "Organization of American States" twenty-one nation foreign ministers meeting, forcibly convened by the United States, has concluded after the United States forcibly passed several resolutions. From the entire process and results of this meeting, people can draw two conclusions: First, as fair-minded public opinion in Latin America and Cuban Prime Minister Castro have repeatedly pointed out, the "Organization of American States" is a complete tool used by the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries; but, second, the political situation in Latin America today has made it impossible for the United States to do whatever it wants even within the "Organization of American States."
    The purpose of the United States in convening this meeting of American foreign ministers was to use the meeting to impose fabricated charges on Cuba, and to put a legal cloak on the activities of the United States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and further subvert the current Cuban government. This is a well-known conspiracy. People can clearly see this conspiracy from the speeches of American power figures and reactionary newspapers before the meeting, from the agenda arranged by the United States for the meeting, and from the speech of U.S. Secretary of State Herter at the meeting.
  Among the resolutions forced through the meeting by the United States, the one that most prominently exposes the conspiracy of the United States is the resolution on expanding the powers of the Inter-American Peace Committee. This resolution stipulates that this committee should study the so-called tensions in the Caribbean region, and that it should review methods and measures to prevent foreign countries from overthrowing existing governments or instigating intervention or aggression. What does such a resolution mean? It means that the Inter-American Peace Committee, which is manipulated by the United States and chaired by the United States, can arbitrarily determine who is the "culprit" creating tension in the Caribbean region after so-called "research," and can arbitrarily falsely accuse the struggle against pro-American dictatorial regimes within countries such as the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua as "foreign aggression." Such a resolution also means that the United States can use the Inter-American Peace Committee to propose various so-called "anti-aggression" measures, including military measures, and coerce Latin American countries to act with it. Who can imagine that the Inter-American Peace Committee, manipulated by the United States, might accuse the United States and its pawns Trujillo and Somoza of being the real culprits in creating tensions in the Caribbean region? Who can imagine that such an institution would oppose any activities to subvert the current government of Cuba or invade Cuba instigated by the United States? Therefore, such a resolution is essentially paving the way for the United States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, providing an excuse for the United States to suppress the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, and preparing conditions for the United States to coerce the "Organization of American States" to interfere in Cuba under the guise of "anti-aggression." Isn't all this very obvious?
    Herter talked a lot about the so-called "non-interference principle" of the "Organization of American States" at the beginning of the meeting, and viciously insinuated that Cuba was "interfering" in the internal affairs of other countries. This, of course, can only expose the guilty conscience of the United States and its clumsy trick of a thief crying "stop thief." The fact that the United States hijacked the meeting to pass its decision eloquently shows that the "Organization of American States" is far from being the "effective peace system" that Herter boasted about, which shows the "unity among American countries," but is purely an aggressive institution used by the United States to interfere in Latin American internal affairs.
    However, today's era is not the era of 1954 when the United States used the "Organization of American States" to interfere in Guatemala. First of all, the painted skin of the "Organization of American States" has been pierced, which makes it difficult for the United States to swagger and deceive in Latin America under the guise of the "Organization of American States." Secondly, the United States' control over the "Organization of American States" is undergoing changes that are unfavorable to the United States. At this meeting of American foreign ministers, Cuba brought the struggle against American interference to the meeting. Herter's proposal to establish a committee to supervise the "realization of democracy" in Latin American countries, a blatant interference in internal affairs, was not passed due to the firm opposition of Cuba and Venezuela. The United States was very enthusiastic about establishing a so-called "Organization of American States police force," but it did not dare to even mention it at this meeting for fear of the general opposition of Latin American countries. The issue of Latin America's economic underdevelopment, which the United States opposed discussing before the meeting, was still brought up at the meeting and aroused heated discussions; although the resolution put forward by the meeting in this regard failed to touch the essence of the problem due to the pressure of the United States, this was, after all, the issue that the United States was most afraid of, so the discussion was a blow to the United States. The United States' attempt to use an empty resolution to cover up the essence of this issue is a futile effort, and it cannot prevent the Latin American people from finding the correct answer to the question of "what is the root cause of all the pain and anxiety in Latin America," which is: the plunder and exploitation of U.S. imperialism.
    All of the above shows that the United States could not completely get its way at this meeting. The days when U.S. representatives could just take out a draft resolution from their pockets at the meetings of the "Organization of American States" and representatives of other countries would just sign it are over.
    The situation of this meeting of American foreign ministers shows that the United States' conspiracy to interfere in and subvert Cuba, and the threat to the independence and sovereignty of Latin American countries, have not decreased, but increased. However, due to the in-depth development of the national democratic movement in Latin America, and due to the support of the world's peace forces and broad public opinion, we believe that the Latin American people will be able to strengthen unity, support each other, and advance victoriously in the struggle against U.S. imperialist interference and aggression, and in the struggle to safeguard the national independence and peace and security of Latin American countries.

　　评美洲外长会议
　　本报评论员
    美国强制举行的“美洲国家组织”二十一国外长会议，在美国强制通过数项决议后，已经宣告收场。人们从这次会议的全部过程及其结果中可以得出两个结论：第一，正如拉丁美洲的公正舆论和古巴总理卡斯特罗所一再指出的，“美洲国家组织”是彻头彻尾的一个被美国用来干涉拉丁美洲各国内政的工具；但是，第二，今天拉丁美洲的政治形势已经使得美国即使在“美洲国家组织”内部也不能为所欲为了。
    美国召开这次美洲外长会议的目的，是打算通过这次会议给古巴加上“莫须有”的罪名，为美国干涉古巴内政和进一步颠覆古巴现政府的活动披上合法的外衣。这是众所周知的阴谋。人们无论从美国当权人物和反动报刊在会前的言论中，从美国为会议所安排的议程中，从美国国务卿赫脱在会议的发言中，都可以一清二楚地看出这一阴谋。
  在美国强使会议通过的各项决议中，最突出暴露美国的阴谋的，就是关于扩大泛美和平委员会权力的决议。这项决议规定由这个委员会来研究所谓加勒比地区的紧张局势问题，并且由它来审查防止外国推翻现存政府或是策动干涉或侵略的方法和措施。这样一个决议意味着什么呢？这意味着那个被美国操纵并且由美国担任主席的泛美和平委员会在经过所谓“研究”后，可以任意规定谁是制造加勒比地区紧张局势的“祸首”，可以任意把多米尼加、尼加拉瓜这些国家内部的反对亲美独裁政权的斗争诬指为“外国侵略”。这样的决议也意味着美国可以假手泛美和平委员会而提出包括军事措施在内的种种所谓“反侵略”的措施，要挟拉丁美洲国家同它一起行动。谁能想像美国操纵的泛美和平委员会可能指控美国和它的走卒特鲁希略、索摩查之流是制造加勒比地区紧张局势的真正祸首呢？谁又能想像这样的一个机构会反对由美国策动的任何颠覆古巴现存政府或侵略古巴的活动呢？因此，这样的决议实质上是为美国干涉古巴内政的活动开辟道路，是为美国镇压多米尼加、尼加拉瓜的人民反独裁斗争提供借口，是为美国在“反侵略”的幌子下要挟“美洲国家组织”对古巴进行干涉准备条件，这一切难道不是很明显的吗？
    赫脱在会议一开始就大谈特谈所谓“美洲国家组织”的“不干涉原则”，并且恶毒地影射古巴“干涉”他国内政，这当然只能暴露美国的做贼心虚的心理状态和它的贼喊捉贼的拙劣手法。美国挟持会议通过它的决定这一事实，雄辩地说明“美洲国家组织”远不是赫脱所吹嘘的那种表现“美洲国家之间的团结”的“有效的和平体系”，而纯粹是一个被美国用来干涉拉丁美洲内部事务的侵略机构。
    但是，今天的时代毕竟不是1954年美国利用“美洲国家组织”来干涉危地马拉的时代了。首先，“美洲国家组织”的画皮已经被戳破，这就使得美国难以披着“美洲国家组织”的外衣在拉丁美洲招摇撞骗。其次，美国对“美洲国家组织”内部的控制力量，正在起着对美国不利的变化。在这次美洲外长会议上，古巴把反对美国干涉的斗争带到会场上。赫脱的关于设立一个委员会来监督拉丁美洲各国“实现民主”这样一个露骨干涉内政的建议，就由于古巴和委内瑞拉的坚决反对而未获通过。美国所十分热心的建立所谓“美洲国家组织警察部队”，因慑于拉丁美洲国家的普遍反对，在这次会议上连提都不敢提出来。而美国在会前所反对讨论的关于拉丁美洲经济不发达的问题，则在会议上还是被提了出来，并引起了热烈的讨论；虽然由于美国的压力，会议就这方面所提出的决议未能触及问题的本质，但这毕竟是美国最忌讳的问题，因此进行了讨论就是对美国的一个打击。美国想用一纸空洞的决议来掩饰这一问题的实质，是枉费心机，它不能阻止拉丁美洲人民从“什么是拉丁美洲一切痛苦和不安的根源”这一问题中找出正确的答案，那就是：美帝国主义的掠夺和剥削。
    以上这一切，说明了美国在这次会议上并不能完全称心如愿。美国代表在“美洲国家组织”的会议上只要从口袋里拿出决议草案来，其他国家的代表就照章画押的日子是过去了。
    这次美洲外长会议的情况表明：美国对古巴进行干涉和颠覆的阴谋，对拉丁美洲各国独立和主权的威胁，不是减少了，而是增加了。但是，由于拉丁美洲民族民主运动的深入发展，由于全世界和平力量和广大舆论的支持，我们相信，拉丁美洲人民一定能够加强团结，互相支援，在反对美帝国主义干涉和侵略的斗争中，在维护拉丁美洲各国的民族独立和和平安全的斗争中，胜利前进。
