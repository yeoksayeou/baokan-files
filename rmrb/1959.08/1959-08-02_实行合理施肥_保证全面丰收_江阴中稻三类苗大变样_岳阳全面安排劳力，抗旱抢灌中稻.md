This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th dispatch—Jiangsu Province's Jiangyin County has achieved significant results in changing the growth conditions of third-class intermediate rice seedlings. More than 900,000 people were mobilized throughout the county to carry out a concentrated campaign of topdressing fertilizer and field management. The proportion of third-class seedlings has decreased from 11.6% to 7.7%.

Jiangyin County planted intermediate rice seedlings early, with sufficient base fertilizer and timely topdressing, resulting in good growth. However, the growth of rice seedlings was uneven. According to a comparison of 800,000 mu of intermediate rice, first-class seedlings, characterized by dark leaves, sufficient fertilizer, thick stalks, and vigorous growth, accounted for 56.65% of the rice field area. Second-class seedlings, which showed vigorous growth but insufficient tillering, accounted for 31.75% of the rice field area. Third-class seedlings, characterized by being thin, yellow, and having very little tillering, accounted for 11.6%. From a regional perspective, third-class seedlings existed in all areas, both in lagging areas and advanced areas. From a soil perspective, third-class seedlings grew in both poor and good fields. The main reason for the emergence of third-class seedlings was the relaxation of field management after the summer planting season.

In order to ensure balanced growth of rice seedlings on a large scale and to further lay a solid foundation for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn, the county committee launched a concentrated field management campaign starting in mid-July, focusing on changing the growth conditions of third-class seedlings. Leadership was strengthened from the county committee to the production team level, with secretaries taking the lead.

Cadres of various production teams led experienced farmers and technicians to go deep into the fields to inspect rice seedlings plot by plot, determine their type, and adopt effective measures tailored to local conditions and times, prescribing the right remedy and promoting growth according to seedling conditions. First, topdressing fertilizer was emphasized, with heavy application to third-class seedlings, general application to second-class seedlings, and skillful application to first-class seedlings. Second, water management was strengthened. First-class seedlings, which were starting to develop round stalks and nodes, needed plenty of water and should be deeply irrigated. Second and third-class seedlings, which were in the tillering stage, should be irrigated with a moderate depth of water, maintaining slightly more than an inch of water. At the same time, pests were comprehensively eliminated to prevent rice diseases.

After the types and measures were determined, signs were immediately posted in the fields, and the masses were mobilized to implement the measures without error or omission. Areas with insufficient fertilizer immediately launched a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign, accumulating while producing and applying. Luqiao Commune inspected all rice fields and found that 140,000 dan of topdressing fertilizer were needed. At the time, only 90,000 dan were available. The commune immediately deployed more than 3,000 laborers, who dredged mud day and night, applying it to the fields while dredging. In two days of intensive work, the task of topdressing fertilizer for second and third-class seedlings was completed. In the process of accumulating and applying fertilizer, various areas also universally carried out the elimination of rice borers.

Qingchang Commune applied fertilizer once to more than 7,200 mu of third-class seedlings during the "assault week." After the topdressing was basically completed, it was found through inspection that there were still more than 300 mu of fields that had not changed color, so another 3,600 jin of chemical fertilizer were applied.

The county achieved very good results through a week of intensive work. According to the latest statistics, first-class seedlings have increased from 56.65% to 63.39%, second-class seedlings have decreased from 31.75% to 29.54%, and third-class seedlings have decreased from 11.6% to 7.17%. The intensive work is continuing.

This newspaper dispatch—Hunan's Yueyang County, in carrying out the drought resistance struggle, based on the requirements of taking into account intermediate rice, double-cropping late rice, miscellaneous grain crops, and cash crops, and striving for complete victory, made comprehensive arrangements for water sources and labor, and has achieved initial victories.

Yueyang County is a county in the Xiangtan Special District with a relatively severe drought. Since the end of June, there has been no rain, and both paddy fields and dry land have been threatened by drought to varying degrees. Some commune and brigade leaders only paid attention to rushing to plant late rice, neglecting the drought resistance and rescue of intermediate rice, which urgently needed irrigation during the heading and flowering stages. Not enough attention was also paid to drought resistance for miscellaneous grain crops and cash crops. The Yueyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the county has 300,000 mu of intermediate rice, which is only 30,000 mu less than the planned area for late rice. A few more irrigations would be enough to reap a bumper harvest, and rescuing intermediate rice should be the top priority. Late rice should also be planted as much as possible, and drought resistance for miscellaneous grain crops and cash crops should also be placed in an important position. Only in this way can we guarantee the comprehensive realization of the total grain output and total output value plan. Therefore, the Yueyang County Committee repeatedly explained the favorable conditions for overcoming the drought to all cadres and commune members at telephone conferences and radio broadcasts, requiring comprehensive arrangements to be made in terms of water sources and labor. It also put forward three opinions on resolving the contradiction between drought resistance to ensure harvest and drought resistance to rush planting: (1) Where water sources are sufficient, we must comprehensively rescue intermediate rice and plant late rice according to plan or exceeding the plan; (2) In general areas, we should first rescue intermediate rice, and at the same time strive to plant late rice according to plan; (3) In areas with insufficient water sources, where irrigation cannot be guaranteed after late rice is planted, we should resolutely rescue intermediate rice. For late rice, we can first adopt methods such as planting temporary seedlings and appropriately postpone the planting time, depending on the situation. If it is still not possible to plant by "Beginning of Autumn," we will change to planting miscellaneous grains.

The cadres and masses throughout the county responded enthusiastically to the call of the county committee. Within a few days, the drought resistance army quickly increased from more than 50,000 people to 123,000 people, accounting for more than 56% of the total labor force. Buxianqiao Commune used 68% of its labor force for drought resistance, and divided it into three groups. One group of more than 5,000 people was responsible for rescuing intermediate rice, one group of more than 1,400 people was responsible for drought resistance and seedling protection for late rice that had already been planted, and one group of more than 1,100 people was responsible for drought resistance for dry land crops. In addition, 18% of the labor force rushed to finish the "double rush" (harvesting of early rice and planting of late rice), and 4.1% of the labor force engaged in diversified operations. A responsibility system was established for all production activities. In a few days, more than 19,000 mu of intermediate rice in urgent need of water lifting for rescue were universally irrigated one to three times. Another 4,000 mu of late rice were rushed to be planted, and 2,800 mu of drought-stricken sweet potatoes and 1,300 mu of cash crops were also universally watered or covered with grass to retain water.

In the drought resistance process, a mass campaign of offering advice was universally launched throughout the county. More than 3,300 commune members in Gangkou Commune offered 8,887 suggestions, identified 5,596 water sources, which could irrigate more than 12,700 mu of land. The masses in Xinqiang Commune offered advice and built a dam across the Sha River, causing the upstream river water to flow back into a large port eight li long in the Sanhe Polder. This not only protected more than 10,000 mu of intermediate and late rice from drought for 30 to 40 days, but also reduced the number of pumping stages from four to one due to the rise in the water level of the large port. One hundred and twenty-seven mu were able to implement gravity irrigation, saving 8,410 man-days of water lifting.

The drought resistance struggle has now achieved initial victories. More than 157,000 mu of intermediate rice in urgent need of water lifting for rescue throughout the county have been universally irrigated one to three times. More than 70,000 mu of the more than 230,000 mu of miscellaneous grain crops and cash crops have been watered, and most of the rest have been loosened or covered. More than 170,000 mu of late rice have been planted. On the basis of the initial victory, the people of the county are full of confidence, advancing victoriously, and striving for complete victory.

    实行合理施肥　保证全面丰收
    江阴中稻三类苗大变样   
    岳阳全面安排劳力，抗旱抢灌中稻
    本报南京30日电　江苏省江阴县在改变中稻三类苗生长情况方面，已收到显著效果。全县出动九十多万人次，突击追肥，加工管理，三类苗已从11.6％下降到7.7％。
    江阴县中稻莳秧早，底肥足，追肥及时，长势很好。但稻苗生长情况不平衡。据八十万亩中稻排队比较，叶子黑、肥力足、茎秆粗壮，生长有力的一类苗占稻田面积56.65％；生长虽然有力，但发棵不足的二类苗，占稻田面积31.75％；瘦弱、发黄、发棵很少的三类苗，占稻田面积11.6％。从地区来看，三类苗各地都有：落后地区有，先进地区也有。从土质来看，不好的田里固然长了三类苗，就是好的田里也有三类苗。产生三类苗的主要原因，是夏种以后放松了田间管理。
    为了保证当前稻苗大面积生长平衡，进一步打好秋熟全面丰收基础，县委发动各地群众从7月中旬起，开展了以改变三类苗生长情况为重点的田间管理突击运动。从县委到生产小队都加强了领导，由书记挂帅。
    各生产队干部带领老农、技术员深入田头，逐丘查看稻苗，确定类型，因时因地制宜，采取有效措施，对症下药，看苗促进。首先以追肥为重点，重施三类苗，普施二类苗，巧施一类苗。其次是加强用水管理。开始圆秆拔节的一类苗，正需要水分，应深灌；正在分蘖发棵阶段的二、三类苗，灌水不深不浅，保持一寸多水。同时全面消灭虫害，防止稻子生病。
    类型、措施确定以后，立即插牌到田，发动群众根据既定措施，做到不错不漏。肥料不足地区立即大搞积肥运动，边积边造，边造边施。陆桥公社检查全部稻田共需追肥十四万担，当时只有九万担，全社立即投放三千多个劳动力，一方面将原有肥料全部追下去，一方面组织农船日夜罱泥浆，边罱边下田。突击二天，已全部完成二、三类苗追肥任务。在积肥追肥中，各地还普遍进行除治螟害。
    青肠公社在“突击周”里对七千二百多亩三类苗追施了一次肥料。追肥基本结束以后，通过检查，发现还有三百多亩田没有转色，又追施化肥三千六百多斤。
    全县通过一周突击，效果很好，根据最近统计：一类苗已由56.65％上升到63.39％，二类苗由31.75％下降到29.54％，三类苗由11.6％降到7.17％。现在正在继续突击中。
    本报讯　湖南岳阳县在开展抗旱斗争中，本着中稻、双季晚稻、杂粮作物和经济作物兼顾、力争全胜的要求，对水源和劳动力作出全面安排，并已取得初步胜利。
    岳阳县是湘潭专区旱情较严重的县，自6月下旬起到现在，一直没有下雨，不论水田旱田都受到不同程度的干旱威胁。部分公社、大队领导干部只注意抢插晚稻，忽视对正在孕穗扬花急需灌溉的中稻的抗旱抢救。对杂粮作物和经济作物的抗旱，也注意得不够。中共岳阳县委认为：全县中稻有三十万亩，比晚稻计划面积仅少三万亩，再灌几次水就能夺得丰收，抢救中稻应是当务之急。晚稻同样要尽力抢插，杂粮作物和经济作物抗旱也应摆在重要地位。只有这样才能保证粮食总产量、总产值计划的全面实现。因此，岳阳县委先后在电话会、广播会上，反复向全体干部、社员讲清战胜干旱的有利条件，要求从水源、劳力上加以全面安排，并对解决抗旱保收和抗旱抢插的矛盾，提出三条意见：（1）水源充足的地方，一定要全面抢救中稻和按计划或超额插下晚稻；（2）一般地区首先抢救中稻，同时力争按计划插下晚稻；（3）水源不足、晚稻插下不能保证灌溉的，坚决抢救中稻，对晚稻可先采用插寄秧等办法，适当推迟插秧时间，看情况办理，如到了“立秋”还插不下，便改种杂粮。
    全县干部、群众热烈响应县委的号召，在几天之内抗旱大军迅速由原来的五万多人增加到十二万三千人，占总劳力56％以上。步仙桥公社用68％的劳动力抗旱，并分成三路，一路有五千多人，负责抢救中稻，一路有一千四百多人，负责已插晚稻抗旱保苗和培育管理，一路一千一百多人负责旱地作物抗旱，另外，18％的劳力突击“双抢”扫尾，4.1％的劳力搞多种经营。各项生产都建立了责任制。几天工夫，一万九千多亩急需车水抢救的中稻，都普遍灌溉一至三次，还抢插了四千亩晚稻，二千八百亩受旱红薯和一千三百多亩经济作物，也普遍浇了水或盖草保水。
    在抗旱中，全县普遍开展了群众性的献计运动。筻口公社三千三百多社员，便献策八千八百八十七条，找出水源五千五百九十六处，可灌田一万二千七百多亩。新墙公社群众献计在沙河筑了一座拦河大坝，使上游河水倒流入三合垸一条八里长的大港，不仅使一万多亩中、晚稻三十至四十天不受旱，并且由于大港水位抬高以后，使原来四递抽水机抽水减至一递抽水，有一百二十七亩实行自流灌溉，节省车水工八千四百一十个。
    抗旱斗争现已取得初步胜利。全县急需车水抢救的十五万七千多亩中稻，已普遍灌溉一至三次。二十三万多亩杂粮作物、经济作物，已有七万来亩浇了水，其他大部分进行了松土或覆盖。晚稻已插下十七万多亩。全县人民在初战胜利基础上，正满怀信心，乘胜前进，力争全胜。（附图片）
