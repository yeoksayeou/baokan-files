Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: The entire workforce of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, having exceeded the state coal production plan by 2.07% and the tunneling plan by 1.59% in July, is now advancing with even greater vigor, striving to produce more coal in August.

On the night of July 31st, as the last shift of workers was fighting underground to overproduce even more coal by the end of the month, the Mining Bureau leadership, at the bureau-wide production dispatch telephone conference, arranged for the production in August, proposing that August's production should increase by 20,000 tons of coal compared to July, changing the past practice where August's output was often lower than July's due to more rainfall. The Mining Bureau Party Committee required all subordinate mines to complete the production plan evenly on a daily and ten-day basis, resolutely reversing the past phenomenon of lower output at the beginning of the month and tightening up later, to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the August production plan.

The Mining Bureau decided to take four main measures in August to increase raw coal production. First, reorganize labor organization to tap the potential of the existing labor force. Second, extensively carry out the campaign to increase production and conserve resources, centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. Through on-site meetings, exchange advanced operating methods, promote the advanced experience of rapid tunneling in key working faces in each mine, and implement cross-operation of different types of work in the mining faces, to fully utilize working hours. Third, increase the attendance rate of employees at the beginning of the month, and strictly implement the rotation system for rest. Fourth, further strengthen safety production education for employees, resolutely implement safety production rules and regulations, and ensure safe production.

The mines under the Mining Bureau held workshops, cadre meetings, or employee meetings in late July to prepare for August's production. Datai Mine, which completed the July plan ahead of schedule, strengthened transportation capacity and the tunneling and maintenance of roadways, and prepared for the new working face in August in advance. Because of the change in geological conditions in one working face of Chengzi Mine, the tunneling could not keep up with the needs of mining. The leadership immediately assigned two more groups here to strengthen tunneling to ensure that August production was not affected. Anjiatan Mine overhauled the winches at the end of July and installed the electric chute on the new working face; and according to the current situation, the five mining groups that were originally planned to be transferred to the new working face at the beginning of the month were transferred earlier or later respectively, so that the output in early August would not be reduced.

Xinhua News Agency, Zaozhuang, August 1st: The Shandong Zaozhuang Mining Bureau took effective measures early to ensure that the output at the beginning of the month was not lower than the level at the end of last month, in order to complete the coal production task for August in a balanced manner.

For a long time, the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau's production had been in a passive situation of being loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month. In late July, the Mining Bureau specially held a meeting of mine managers and engineers to specifically analyze the reasons for the looseness at the beginning of the month. According to their analysis, the large number of meetings in the first ten days, the late delivery of plans, and the concentration of equipment maintenance at the beginning of the month were important factors causing the looseness at the beginning of the month, but the most important factor was the idea that one could relax at the beginning of the month. Therefore, they unanimously believed that the key to ensuring the completion of mining and tunneling plans on a daily basis from the first day of the month is that leading cadres must first change the idea of being loose at the beginning of the month and at the same time strengthen ideological education for employees. Now, all mines are using pre-shift and post-shift meetings to carry out propaganda and education in this regard to workers; the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau are also urging all mines to effectively grasp this work through telephone dispatch.

In response to the situation in the past where there were many meetings in the first ten days, and cadres participated in the meetings, which relaxed on-site management, the Mining Bureau has determined that no meetings will be held in the first ten days, and instructions should be conveyed by telephone as much as possible; meetings that must be held must also be approved by the Director and Mine Managers in order to ensure that cadres have time to go deep into the site and lead production well.

It is necessary to carry out a major equipment overhaul once a month to ensure normal production; however, in the past, the equipment overhaul work of the mines under this Mining Bureau was concentrated on one day, and concentrated on the first day of the month, which also affected the production in the first ten days. Now they have determined that, except for important holidays, the equipment maintenance time will not be scheduled for the first day of the month, and each mine can formulate the date according to the specific situation and carry it out in an alternating manner.

In the past, the work plan was arranged too late, which made the workers unclear about their goals and lacked a clear goal, which also affected the production in the first ten days. Now, the Mining Bureau has strengthened its work in this area, and the production indicators have been delivered to the grassroots production units as early as the 27th of last month, and the technical measures reported by each mine were also approved as early as the 28th of last month, so as to ensure that each mine can operate according to the plan from the beginning of the month.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 1st: On the basis of overfulfilling the state production plan for July, the Hegang Mining Bureau is actively organizing a bumper coal production in August.

The Hegang Coal Mine completed the entire month's coal mining plan half a day ahead of schedule on July 31st. The output of raw coal increased compared with June, and the tunneling also exceeded the monthly plan. In the past few days, 50,000 employees of the entire mine have enthusiastically discussed the August production increase plan and measures, proposing that August should produce 10% more raw coal than July.

The Hegang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to make increasing coal production the central task that overrides everything else in the city. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee and the Director of the Hegang Mining Bureau went deep down to assist six large mines, including Nanshan and Xing'an, in mobilizing the masses, and summarized the advanced production experience since July. Xing'an Mine's "parallel cross-flow mining method" and Nanshan Mine's "rapidly moving chute" experience have been exchanged and promoted in various mines through on-site meetings. The Hegang Mining Bureau is also preparing to hold an advanced experience exchange conference in early August to widely disseminate advanced experience and improve production levels.

More than a dozen new coal mining faces have been opened in various mines, and some experienced miners have been transferred to support them.

    京西、枣庄、鹤岗煤矿乘胜前进
    八月第一天起就抓紧煤炭高产
    新华社1日讯　京西矿务局的全体职工，7月份分别超额2.07％和1.59％完成国家产煤计划和掘进计划以后，正以更大的干劲，乘胜前进，力争8月份生产更多的煤炭。
    7月31日夜晚，当最后一班工人正在井下为月底超产更多煤炭而战的时候，矿务局领导上在全局的生产调度电话会议上布置了8月份的生产，提出8月份要比7月份增产两万吨煤炭，改变历年8月因降雨量较多产量常常低于7月份的惯例。矿务局党委要求所属各矿按日按旬均衡地完成生产计划，坚决扭转过去月初产量较低的前松后紧现象，保证完成和超额完成8月份的生产计划。
    这个矿务局决定在8月份采取四项主要措施，提高原煤产量。一、整顿劳动组织，挖掘现有劳动力的潜力。二、广泛开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，通过现场会议，交流先进的操作方法，在各矿重点掌子面推行快速掘进的先进经验，在回采工作面实行分别工种交叉作业，以充分利用工时。三、提高职工月初出勤率，严格按照轮休制度轮休。四、进一步加强对职工的安全生产教育，坚决贯彻执行安全生产的规章制度，保证安全生产。
    这个煤矿所属各矿，在7月下旬就先后召开了车间干部会或职工大会，为8月份的生产做了一系列的准备。提前完成7月份计划的大台矿，加强了运输力量和巷道的掘进、维修工作，并且提前作好了8月份新增工作面的准备。城子矿的一个工作面因为地质条件变化，掘进跟不上回采需要，领导上立即在这里多配备了两个组加强掘进，保证8月份生产不受影响。安家滩矿在7月底检修了绞车，又安装好了新工作面的电溜子；并且根据当前的情况，把原计划在月初转移到新工作面去的五个采掘小组，分别提前或推迟转移，使8月上旬的产量不至降低。
    新华社枣庄1日电　山东枣庄矿务局及早采取有效措施，保证月初的产量不低于上月底的水平，以便均衡地完成8月份的煤炭生产任务。
    很长时期以来，枣庄矿务局的生产就存在着月初松、月末紧的被动状况。7月下旬，矿务局专门召开矿长和工程师会议，具体分析了产生月初松的原因。据他们分析，上旬会议多，计划下达得晚，设备检修一起集中在月初进行等，固然是产生月初松的重要因素，但是最主要的，还是因为月初可以松一口气的这种思想作怪。因此，他们一致认为，领导干部首先改变月初松的思想，同时加强职工的思想教育，是保证从月初第一天起就能按日完成回采和掘进计划的重要关键。现在，各矿井都利用班前、班后会议，向工人进行这方面的宣传教育；矿务局的领导干部也通过电话调度督促各矿切实抓紧这项工作。
    针对过去上旬开会多，干部都参加会议，而使现场管理有所放松的情况，矿务局已确定上旬不开会，尽量利用电话传达指示；非开不可的会议，也要经过局长和矿长批准，以便保证干部有时间深入现场，领导好生产。
    每月进行一次设备大检修，是保证正常生产必不可少的；但是，这个矿务局所属各矿的设备检修工作，以往都是集中在一天进行，而且集中在月初的头一天进行，这样也使上旬的生产受到一定的影响。现在他们确定，除了重要假日之外，设备检修时间都不安排在月初头一天，各矿可以根据具体情况拟定日期，交叉地进行。
    过去由于作业计划安排过迟，致使工人心中无数，奋斗目标不明确，也影响了上旬的生产。现在，矿务局已加强了这方面的工作，生产指标已提前在上月27日下达到基层生产单位，各矿报送来的技术措施也早在上月28日审批完毕，这样可以保证各矿月初一开始就按照计划作业。
    新华社哈尔滨1日电鹤岗矿务局在超额完成7月份国家生产计划的基础上，正在积极组织8月份的煤炭大丰产。
    鹤岗煤矿在7月31日提前半天完成了全月采煤计划，原煤产量比6月份增加，掘进也超过了月计划。这几天来，全矿五万名职工热烈讨论了8月份的增产计划和措施，提出8月份要生产比7月份多10％的原煤。
    中共鹤岗市委决定把增产煤炭作为全市压倒一切的中心任务。市委书记和鹤岗矿务局局长都深入下去协助南山、兴安等六个大矿发动群众，并且总结7月份以来的先进生产经验。兴安矿的“回采平行交叉流水采煤法”，南山矿的“快速挪溜子”经验，都已经通过现场会议的方式，在各矿交流和推广。鹤岗矿务局还准备在8月初召开先进经验交流大会，广泛传播先进经验，提高生产水平。
    各矿井已经开辟了十多个新的采煤工作面，抽调了一部分有经验的矿工去支援。
