　　"Dongpo Fields": Then and Now
    The Party branch and team cadres of the Zhonghe Brigade fully trusted the masses, and the masses in turn fully trusted the Party branch and team cadres. There were full discussions before the early rice was sown, and during field management, cadres "set up camp in the fields" to fight alongside the masses. People were of one mind, and the land was also of one mind with the people—if we wanted a large increase in production, it would deliver a large increase in production.
    This brigade is located on the coast of northwestern Hainan Island. The Song Dynasty writer Su Dongpo lived here, having been exiled there. Although he was repeatedly exiled because he was conservative and opposed Wang Anshi's New Policies, the life of exile gave him the opportunity to get closer to the lives of the people, to say things that sympathized with the people, and to do things that sympathized with the people. Therefore, the people still liked him. In that era, even if he wanted to do more for the people, it was impossible. "Weary of the long night on my pillow, the small window is still not bright. A solitary dog barks in a remote village, a few people walk beneath the waning moon. My temples have long since turned white, my traveler's heart is empty and clear. In the desolate wilderness, the katydid weaves, but what can it achieve by weaving in vain!" This is a poem he wrote when he lived in Danzhou (where the Zhonghe Brigade is now located). In that era, he could only have such sorrow. He could only compare himself in the long night to a "katydid" (a kind of autumn insect), having the sound of weaving, but unable to weave any cloth.
    For hundreds of years, Danzhou remained desolate, production remained backward, and the people's sorrow remained the same. It was not until after liberation that the "Dongpo Fields," which suffered from drought when there was no rain and flooding when there was rain, began to change their appearance. In the first year after collectivization, the yield of early rice doubled. If the poet were alive today, he would no longer be "weary of the long night on his pillow," would he?

### “东坡田”今昔

　　“东坡田”今昔
    中和大队党支部和队干部充分相信群众，群众也就充分相信党支部和队干部。早稻播种前充分商议，在田间管理中干部又“扎寨田头”同群众一起奋战。人和人一条心，地也就和人一条心——要它大增产，它就大增产。
    这个队在海南岛西北部海边上，宋朝的文学家苏东坡在这里住过，是被放逐到那里去的。他迭次被放逐虽是因为守旧、反对王安石的新法，但放逐的生活却使他有机会同人民生活接近一些，说了些同情人民的话，做了些同情人民的事。因此，人民还是喜欢他的。在那个时代，他即使想为人民多做一些事，也不可能。“倦枕厌长夜，小窗终未明。孤村一犬吠，残月几人行。衰鬓久已白，旅怀空自清。荒原有络纬，虚织竟何成！”这就是他住在儋州（就是现在中和大队所在的地方）的时候写的一首诗。在那个时代，他只能有这样的悲哀。他只能在漫漫长夜自比为“络纬”（即“纺织娘”，秋虫的一种），空有纺织之声，却织不出什么布来。
    千百年来，儋州荒凉依旧，生产落后依旧，人民悲哀依旧。直到解放后，无雨即旱，有雨即涝的“东坡田”才开始改变面貌。公社化后第一年，早稻产量就成倍增加。诗人如果活在今天，该再也不会“倦枕厌长夜”了吧？
