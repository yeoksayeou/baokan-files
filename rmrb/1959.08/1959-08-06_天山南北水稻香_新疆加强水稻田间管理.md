    Fragrant Rice Fields North and South of the Tianshan Mountains
    Xinjiang Strengthens Field Management of Rice
    The people's communes in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are striving for a bumper rice harvest this year. Currently, the more than 1.8 million mu of rice fields north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are generally growing well, with neat and strong seedlings. Rice in the northern Xinjiang region, where sowing started earlier, has begun to head, while rice in southern Xinjiang is also jointing. In order to do a good job in rice field management, many major rice-growing areas have launched activities such as weeding, topdressing, irrigation, and pest and disease control. In Aksu County, known as "Beyond-the-Great-Wall Water Country," most of the more than 250,000 mu of paddy fields have been weeded twice, some three times, and topdressed once, some twice. In Miquan County, a well-known high-yield rice area in Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, all 74,000 mu of rice fields have been hoed two to three times, and the rice is growing particularly well. By the end of July, the county had applied Ceresan and lime powder twice to more than 50,000 mu of paddy fields where rice blast has occurred in previous years, and the third round of prevention and control is underway.
    Xinjiang began planting rice on a large scale in 1957. In 1958, it developed to 1.54 million mu. This year, it has increased by another 260,000 mu compared to last year. Not only has the rice acreage expanded in areas where there used to be a habit of growing rice, such as the Aksu River, Ili River basin, and Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, but also in the Altai alpine region and the hot Turpan Basin, which have never grown rice before, rice has been trial-planted this year. In the past, rice cultivation rarely involved fertilization, almost all of it was broadcast, and field management was poor, resulting in low yields. This year, various regions have improved cultivation techniques, generally applying base fertilizer, with many regions applying 5,000 to 10,000 jin of fertilizer; and promoted Xinjiang's Tu Mang, Bai Mang, Hupi and other fine rice varieties to achieve rational close planting. Some areas have implemented dry direct seeding, paddy field dibbling, and transplanting methods.

### 天山南北水稻香  新疆加强水稻田间管理

    天山南北水稻香
    新疆加强水稻田间管理
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各地人民公社正在力争今年水稻丰收。目前，天山南北的一百八十多万亩水稻普遍生长良好，秧苗整齐茁壮。播种较早的北疆地区水稻已开始抽穗，南疆的水稻也正在拔节。为了作好水稻田间管理，许多主要种植水稻的地区展开了拔草、追肥、灌水、防治病虫害等工作。号称“塞外江南”的阿克苏县，二十五万多亩稻田大部分已拔过两次草，有的拔了三次草，还普遍追肥一次，有的追肥两次。昌吉回族自治州著名的水稻高产区米泉县，七万四千多亩水稻已全部薅过两次到三次草，水稻长得特别好。到7月底，全县已在历年发生稻瘟病的五万多亩稻田中施用了两次赛力散和石灰粉，第三次防治工作也正在进行。
    新疆大量种植水稻是从1957年开始的。1958年，发展到一百五十四万亩。今年又比去年增加了二十六万亩。不仅过去有种水稻习惯的阿克苏河、伊犁河流域和昌吉回族自治州等地区的水稻面积扩大了，连从未种过水稻的阿勒泰高寒地带和炎热的吐鲁番盆地，今年也都试种了水稻。过去种植水稻一般很少施肥，几乎全部撒播，田间管理也作得差，因而产量低。今年，各地改进了耕作技术，普遍施了底肥，不少地区施肥量达五千斤到一万斤；并推广了新疆的秃芒、白芒、虎皮等水稻良种，作到合理密植。部分地区已实行旱直播、水田点播和插秧的方法。
