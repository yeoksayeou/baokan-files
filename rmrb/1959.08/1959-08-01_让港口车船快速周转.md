    Speed Up the Turnaround of Vehicles and Ships in Ports

    Ports are hubs for land and water transportation, and the quality of port operations plays an extremely important role in accelerating cargo flow and vehicle/ship turnaround. This year, the task of port operations in the second half of the year is very arduous, with 56% of the planned throughput to be completed in the second half. We must make every effort to expand port capacity and fully utilize the potential of water transport.

    As a modern enterprise, a port must have a rigorous organization, unified command, and coordinated actions to carry out production effectively. The rigorous organization and coordinated actions mentioned here mean doing a good job of connecting and balancing the port with various land transportation departments, between the various units within the water transport system, and among the various links within the port. Experience over the years has proven that when the various production links and professional departments of the port cooperate well, it will save the country a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources; otherwise, it will cause serious waste.

    Due to the fact that the planning management system of some enterprises has not yet been fully established, at present, the non-productive berthing time of ships in ports is still too long, the utilization rate of working hours and machinery is still low, and the quality of freight transportation is not high enough. In the past year, more than 80% of cargo damage and discrepancies were caused by improper loading and unloading operations, as well as chaotic handover and tallying systems. In order to expand port capacity and improve transportation quality, we must firmly grasp the strengthening of enterprise management and the establishment and improvement of scientific management systems and responsibility systems. The No. 1 loading and unloading operation zone of Shanghai Port once grasped this key link, increasing labor productivity by 30%. Yichang Port fully mobilized the masses and established a quality inspection system, ensuring the quality of loading and unloading. Some work groups in Qingdao Port initiated "cargo loading quality guarantees," which also achieved certain results. All these practices are worth promoting in various places.

    In order to expand port capacity, it is also necessary to further carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Currently, the main focus of technical innovation in ports should be concentrated on breaking through the six common weak links in the loading and unloading process (opening holds, leveling holds, stacking, supplying materials, climbing slopes, and loading and unloading vehicles). Vigorously organize loading and unloading machinery and joint operations, rationally organize the existing various loading and unloading machinery and tools, and gradually make the entire loading and unloading operation process mechanized and equipped with a complete set of tools. Huangshi Port used handcarts, chain conveyors, belt conveyors, cable cars, and other mechanical tools to form a mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading system for goods such as coal, cement, and steel on ten docks, which increased loading and unloading efficiency by one to two times compared to the past. This is a very good example.

    With the increasing development of industrial and agricultural production and the increasing volume of transportation, the tasks facing the transportation sector are also becoming greater. It is hoped that the water transport departments in various places will responsibly transport the materials entrusted by the state to their destinations completely and without damage, and overcome all difficulties, striving to comprehensively overfulfill this year's tasks.

    让港口车船快速周转
    港口是水陆运输的枢纽，港口工作的好坏，对加速货物流转和车船周转起着极为重要的作用。今年下半年港口工作的任务十分艰巨，按计划有56％的吞吐量要在下半年完成。我们必须千方百计扩大港口通过能力，充分发挥水上运输的潜力。
    作为现代企业的港口，既要有严密的组织，统一的指挥，还要有协调的动作，才能很好地进行生产。这里所说的严密组织和协调的动作，就是要搞好港口与陆运各部门之间、港口与水运系统内部各单位之间、港口内部各环节之间的衔接平衡。历年来经验证明：港口各个生产环节和各专业部门之间协作配合得好，就会为国家节省不少的人力、物力和财力；否则，就会造成严重浪费。
    由于某些企业的计划管理制度尚未完全建立，目前，船舶在港口的非生产停泊时间还太长，工时利用率和机械使用率还较低，货运质量还不够高。过去一年内的货损货差有80％以上是由于装卸、操作不当，以及交接理货制度混乱所造成。为了扩大港口通过能力提高运输质量，必须紧紧抓住加强企业管理，建立和健全科学的管理制度和责任制度。上海港第一装卸作业区曾经抓住了这个环节，使劳动生产率提高了30％。宜昌港由于充分发动了群众，建立了质量检查制度，保证了装卸质量。青岛港的某些工组倡办“货物装船质量保证书”，也收到了一定的效果。所有这些作法，值得各地注意推广。
    为了扩大港口通过能力，还必须进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动。当前，港口技术革新的主要矛头应该集中突破装卸过程中较普遍的六个薄弱环节（起舱、平舱、码垛、供料、爬坡、装卸车）。大力组织装卸机械和联合操作，把现有的各种装卸机械和工具合理地组织起来，逐步使整个装卸操作过程的机械和工具配成套。黄石港用手推车、链板机、皮带机、缆车等机械工具在十座码头上组成煤炭、水泥、钢材等货物的机械化半机械化装卸系统，使装卸效率比过去提高了一至二倍。就是一个很好的事例。
    工农业生产日益发展，运输量日益增长，摆在运输部门面前的任务也愈大。希望各地水运部门负责地把国家托运的物资完整无损地运送到目的地；并且克服一切困难，力争全面超额完成今年的任务。
