    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 4th: The Seventh World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship successfully concluded in Vienna tonight amidst joyful songs. Over ten thousand young people representing one hundred and twelve countries, along with residents of Vienna, held a grand closing ceremony in the City Hall Square.

    The Vienna City Hall Square was packed with people, and the streets near the square were also filled with Viennese citizens watching the closing ceremony. This was a farewell meeting for the delegates from various countries participating in the festival, and also the last gathering with the residents of Vienna.

    The evening's cultural program began at 8 p.m., featuring a showcase of excellent performances from the festival. The Leningrad Ballet Troupe, the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe, the Korean Democratic People's Republic Dance Troupe, as well as artists from Cuba, France, the German Democratic Republic, Ghana, Venezuela, and other countries performed at the evening.

    After the performances, Mr. Bernini, representative of the International Festival Committee and Chairman of the World Federation of Youth, read the Vienna Festival Closing Declaration of the Festival Committee and announced the closing of the festival.

    On the streets and in the various squares, young people sang and danced joyfully until late at night.

    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 5th: The International Committee of the Seventh World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship issued a declaration at the closing of the festival, summarizing the great achievements of this festival and calling on young people around the world to launch further struggles for peace and friendship, and for a happy life.

    The declaration stated: The festival demonstrated the people's deep desire for progress, freedom, and peace. Twelve hundred young people from different organizations around the world gathered together and spent ten unforgettable days. When young people of different political orientations, different religious beliefs, and different nationalities meet in mutual respect and freely exchange opinions, we believe that mutual understanding and discussion are better than division. We are even more convinced that it is possible to eliminate mistrust between each other and find a peaceful way to solve today's major international problems.

    The declaration said that the grand opening ceremony of the festival was proof of our unity. In the grand "Peace and Friendship" parade, we announced our firm opposition to atomic war, demanded peaceful coexistence, and telegraphed the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, demanding that international outstanding issues be resolved peacefully through consultation. At the friendship meeting of young people from colonial countries and newly independent countries, we demonstrated our will to fight for freedom and equality for all peoples. In the thirteen professional youth meetings, twelve youth meetings with common interests, various discussion forums, educational conferences, and regional meetings, young people correctly assessed their achievements, difficulties, and hopes, exchanged their understandings, and decided to continue to contribute their energy to the cause of human progress and happiness. They want the younger generation to be worthy of the great achievements of the times.

    The declaration then pointed out that the ideals of peace, friendship, and mutual respect had faced division and discord, but all artificial obstacles had been shattered. The festival attracted the attention of the world and the Viennese public opinion. In Vienna, nearly one million Austrians participated in various marches and rallies, fully demonstrating the Austrian people's growing sympathy, solidarity, and deep friendship with the youth of all countries. All attempts to counter the festival have failed.

    The declaration also mentioned the Austrian people's help and hospitality towards the festival. The declaration stated that we have reached an agreement with the Austrian authorities, we respect their laws and neutrality, and we thank the Austrian authorities for all the work they have done to help the festival run smoothly. The declaration said that the Austrian people and those who insist on division are two different things. In order to establish a deeper friendship with the young people of all countries, they warmly support the various activities of the festival.

    The declaration pointed out that the current international situation is that the desire for mutual understanding is stronger than division, and the call for peace is more powerful than war. Peace and mutual understanding live and move forward in friendship. This festival has added a new brick to the construction of all this. Let the governments of all countries hear the people's call for peace and their desire for life, love, and peace.

    The declaration said: The Seventh World Youth Festival has ended. But its experience and ideals will always remain in our hearts. We will take the memories of the ten days spent in Vienna to all parts of the world, so that the great ideals of human peace, friendship, and mutual understanding will forever live in the hearts of young men and women around the world, and will be increasingly promoted.

    青年们，为和平和友谊、为幸福生活而斗争！
    青年联欢节发表宣言胜利闭幕
    据新华社维也纳4日电　第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节今晚在欢乐的歌声中胜利地闭幕了。代表着一百一十二个国家的一万多名青年和维也纳居民一起，在市政府广场举行了盛大的闭幕式。
    维也纳市政府广场人山人海，广场附近的街道上也站满了观看闭幕式的维也纳市民。这是参加联欢节各国代表们的告别会，也是与维也纳居民最后的一次聚会。
    晚上八时文艺节目开始，这是联欢节期间优秀节目的会演。列宁格勒芭蕾舞蹈团、中国京剧团、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国歌舞团以及古巴、法国、德意志民主共和国、加纳、委内瑞拉等国的艺术家都在晚会上表演了节目。
    节目演出结束后，国际联欢节委员会代表、世界青年联盟主席柏尼尼朗读了联欢节委员会关于维也纳联欢节闭幕宣言并宣布联欢节闭幕。
    在大街上和各个广场上，青年们欢乐歌舞，直至深夜。
    新华社维也纳5日电　第七届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节国际委员会在联欢节闭幕的时候，发表了一项宣言，总结这届联欢节的伟大成就，号召全世界青年们为和平和友谊，为幸福生活展开进一步的斗争。
    宣言说：联欢节表明了人民对进步、自由与和平的深刻愿望。世界一千二百个不同组织的青年聚集在一起，度过了难忘的十天。当不同政治方向，不同宗教信仰和不同民族的青年在互相尊重的情况下会见，自由地交换意见的时候，我们相信相互了解和讨论胜于分裂。我们更加相信，有可能消除相互之间的不信任，并且找到一条和平的道路来解决今天国际间的重大问题。
    宣言说，盛大的联欢节开幕式就是我们团结一致的证明。在盛大的“和平与友谊”游行中，我们宣布坚决反对原子战争，要求和平共处，并致电日内瓦外长会议，要求通过协商道路来和平解决国际间悬而未决的问题。在殖民地国家和新独立国家青年的友谊集会上，我们表明了争取各国人民自由和平等的意志。在十三个专业青年会见、十二个同兴趣青年会见、各种讨论会、教育性会议和区域性会见中，青年们正确地估价了自己的成就、困难和希望，交换了彼此的认识，并且决定继续将他们的精力贡献给人类进步和幸福事业。他们要青年一代配得上时代的巨大成就。
    宣言接着指出，和平、友谊和相互尊重的理想曾面对分裂和不和，但是所有人为的障碍已被粉碎，联欢节引起了全世界和维也纳公众舆论的注意。在维也纳，几乎有一百万奥地利人参加了各次游行示威和集会，充分显示了奥地利人民对各国青年日益发展的同情、团结和深厚情谊。所有反联欢节的尝试都失败了。
    宣言还谈到了奥地利人民对联欢节的帮助和热情好客的情形。宣言说，我们和奥地利当局取得了协议，我们尊重他们的法律和中立，也感谢奥地利当局所做的一切帮助联欢节顺利进行的工作。宣言说，奥地利人民和坚持分裂的分子是两回事。为了建立同各国青年更深厚的友谊，他们热烈拥护联欢节的各项活动。
    宣言指出，目前的国际形势是互相了解的愿望比分裂更强烈，和平的呼声比战争更有力。和平和相互了解在友谊中生活和前进。这一届联欢节为建设这一切增添了一块新的砖石。让各国政府听到人民和平的呼声和对生活、友爱与和平的愿望。
    宣言说：第七届世界青年联欢节结束了。但它的经过和理想将永远留在我们心中。我们将带着在维也纳所过十天的记忆奔赴世界各地，使人类和平、友好和相互了解的伟大理想永远活在世界青年男女的心里，并且日益发扬光大。
