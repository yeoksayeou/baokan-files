In the disaster area of Dongjiang, Guangdong, many moving stories about white-clad warriors rescuing the dying and healing the wounded have been circulating recently. The following are just a few of them.

Diagnosis on the Mountain Ridge: Back from the Brink

The torrential rain poured down relentlessly, and the floodwaters quickly crossed the embankment and poured into Shitan Market Town, the location of the Shitan Commune in Zengcheng County. The patients in the commune health center had already been taken away by their relatives, except for female patient Liu Ruchang, who was lying in the ward. Originally, this rural health center had few staff, and patients were cared for by their relatives. Liu Ruchang had a high fever for more than ten days and had been in a coma for the past two days. When the floodwaters rushed in, her family couldn't take care of her in time. By this time, the water had already reached the ward. At this critical moment, Communist Party member and the health center's director, Zhong Boqi, walked in wading through the water while sick. He carried Liu Ruchang on his back and headed towards the warehouse, which had not yet been flooded. Later, he managed to arrange for her to be housed in a thatched shed on a nearby mountain ridge and found her family to take care of her.

She was out of danger from the flood, but due to lack of medical treatment, Liu Ruchang was still struggling on the verge of death. Just then, the disaster area medical team sent by the Guangdong Provincial Health Department arrived. As soon as team leader Huang Rengchao heard about the patient, he immediately went with doctor Wang Zehou and intern nurse Hong Ruizhu. After examining her, they found that the patient had a recurrence of typhoid fever and her life was in grave danger. They quickly injected her with special medicines and emergency injections. After her condition improved, Wang Zehou and Hong Ruizhu took time to see her three times a day. Wang Zehou was originally a surgeon at the Guangzhou Workers' Hospital and lacked experience in treating internal medicine diseases. When the patient's condition changed, he would study books while carefully diagnosing and treating her. Hong Ruizhu was a recent graduate of the Guangzhou Workers' Hospital Affiliated Nursing School, and this was her first time caring for such a critically ill patient. However, she knew that if typhoid fever was not properly cared for, the patient would be in danger. She was no longer afraid of infection and often washed and wiped the patient's bed and treated bedsores. When the patient had difficulty eating, she would feed her spoonful by spoonful. During this period, the patient's condition deteriorated twice, but they were rescued both times. Ten days later, the patient passed the critical period. (Attached picture)

    在广东东江灾区，最近流传着许许多多关于白衣战士救死扶伤的动人故事，下面记载的只是其中的几个。
    山岗诊断　起死回生
    瀑布般的大雨下个不止，洪水很快就越过堤岸，涌进增城县石滩公社的所在地——石滩圩来。在公社卫生院的病人早已由他们的亲人带走了，只有女病人刘汝常，躺在病房里。原来，这所乡村卫生院因为人手少，病人都由他们的亲属护理。刘汝常发高热已十多天，两天来神智昏迷，洪水一下子涌来，她的家人一时顾不上来领她。这时水已漫近病房。正在危急的当儿，共产党员、卫生院院长钟伯启带病涉水走来了，他把刘汝常背上，向尚未浸水的仓库走去。以后，又设法把她安置在附近山岗上的一所茅棚里，找到她的家人来护理。
    脱离了洪水的危险了，可是，因为缺乏药物治疗，刘汝常仍然挣扎在死亡线上。刚巧这时，广东省卫生厅派来的灾区医疗队到了。队长黄仍超一听有病人，立刻就同医生王泽候、实习护士洪瑞珠赶去。他们诊视后，发现病人是伤寒复发，生命已十分危险。他们赶紧为病人注射特效药和急救针剂。病情有了好转以后，王泽候和洪瑞珠每天都抽时间去看她三次。王泽候原是广州工人医院的外科医生，缺乏治疗内科病的经验，碰到病人病情有变化，他就一边拿着书本学习，一边细心诊断治疗。洪瑞珠原是广州工人医院附属护士学校的应届毕业生，护理这样的危重病人还是第一次。但是，她知道伤寒病护理得不好，病人就有危险，也就不再害怕传染，经常为病人洗抹病床，治疗褥疮。病人吃东西有困难，她就拿着匙羹，一口一口喂。这期间，病人的病情虽曾经两次恶化，都被他们抢救过来。十天后，病人度过了危险期。（附图片）
