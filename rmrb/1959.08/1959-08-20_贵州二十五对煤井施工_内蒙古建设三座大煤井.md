Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 19th - Guizhou Province currently has twenty-five pairs of mechanized and semi-mechanized coal mines under intensive construction. They are distributed in areas like Lindong, Langdai, Duyun, Shuicheng, Wengan, and Tieshan. Once completed, they will be able to produce more than 6 million tons of raw coal annually, roughly equivalent to the total raw coal production of the entire province last year.

　　While stepping up the construction of coal mines, Guizhou Province is also building a batch of coal washing plants that will use mechanical production in Wengan, Langdai, Tieshan, Shuicheng, and other places. After these coal washing plants are completed, they will be able to wash 300,000 tons of raw coal annually.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th - The construction workers of the Baotou Mining Bureau and the Wuda Mining Bureau in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are building three large modern coal mines. They are the Wudanggou Vertical Shaft and the Hetangou Vertical Shaft of the Baotou Mining Bureau, and the Suhetu No. 3 Inclined Shaft of the Wuda Mining Bureau. After these three mines are put into production, they can produce 1.65 million tons of fat coal and coking coal annually, directly supporting the production of Baotou Steel.

　　Both mining bureaus are ensuring the smooth construction of these mines with manpower and materials, striving to have these mines completed and put into production this year.

　　贵州二十五对煤井施工
　  内蒙古建设三座大煤井
    新华社贵阳19日电　贵州省目前有二十五对机械化和半机械化的煤井正在加紧施工。它们分布在林东、郎岱、都匀、水城、瓮安和铁山等地，全部建成后每年能生产原煤六百多万吨，约等于去年全省原煤产量的总和。
    在加紧建设煤井的同时，贵州省还在瓮安、郎岱、铁山、水城等地，建设一批将采用机械生产的洗煤厂。这批洗煤厂建成之后，每年能洗原煤三十万吨。
    新华社呼和浩特19日电　内蒙古自治区包头矿务局和乌达矿务局的建井职工，正在建设三座现代化的大型煤井。它们是包头矿务局的五当沟竖井、河滩沟竖井和乌达矿务局的苏和图三号斜井。这三座矿井投入生产后，每年可产肥煤、焦煤一百六十五万吨，直接支援包钢的生产。
    这两个矿务局都从人力、物力上保证这些矿井的顺利建设，使这些矿井争取在今年竣工投入生产。
