Unleash a New Upsurge in Commercial Technological Innovation
By Editorial Board

    The process of commodity circulation is also the labor process of commercial employees. To do a good job in commercial work, in addition to continuously improving service attitude, improving business management and labor organization, it is also necessary to continuously improve tools, equipment, and operating techniques to reduce the labor intensity of employees, improve work efficiency, accelerate commodity circulation, and better serve consumers.
    Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party, with the deepening and development of the Red Flag movement, commercial employees have vigorously carried out technological revolution and technological innovation movements in all work links such as procurement, sales, transfer, and storage. Thousands of innovations and creations have emerged in all walks of life, and many heavy labor or complex operating methods are being replaced by more efficient tools, machinery, and advanced operating methods. Commercial employees are becoming more and more enthusiastic, and the technological revolution and technological innovation movement are constantly developing in depth and breadth wave after wave, and the face of commercial work is also changing with each passing day.
    This year, the workload of commercial work, whether it is commodity procurement, sales, transportation, or storage, has increased significantly compared with last year. The people have also put forward higher requirements for service industries such as catering and hairdressing. The original commercial sector's manpower, tools, and equipment are no longer fully adapted to the ever-increasing tasks. Under this circumstance, only by rapidly improving labor efficiency and striving for one person to do the work of two or several people can the commercial tasks of this year be completed in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner. To achieve this, all commercial employees are required to vigorously push forward the technological revolution and technological innovation movement, create and improve more advanced tools and advanced operating methods, and promote these advanced tools and operating methods more, better, and faster. Perhaps some comrades will say: there are few people and many tasks, where is the time to do it? This is to put technological innovation in opposition to the current heavy tasks. Facts have proved that the two can be unified. Because the greater the task, the shortage of personnel, and the urgency of time, the more it is necessary to rely on technological innovation in all links, promote new tools and advanced operating techniques, and improve labor efficiency. In other words, the heavier the task, the more necessary it is to use one's brains, work hard, do practical work and work cleverly.
    Commercial technological innovation is an innovation movement that runs through all links of the commodity circulation process. It must not only blossom everywhere, but also be combined with the central tasks of various commercial work at that time and place. That is to say, we must proceed from reality, innovate whatever is needed, and innovate first where the need is most urgent. Otherwise, it will be divorced from the situation, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses, and the purpose of innovation cannot be achieved.
    How to solve the problem of raw materials and materials is an important issue in the current promotion of innovative tools. If this problem is solved well and the direction is correct, the work of innovation, creation, and promotion can move forward, otherwise it will stagnate. Is it difficult to solve this problem? That depends on what method is used; if one disregards the conditions and only wants to engage in the most advanced tools, which require a lot of steel and electricity, then it is more difficult, because steel and electricity are the most needed for the current national construction. If we can conscientiously mobilize the masses, adapt to local conditions, use local materials, rely on our own efforts, and try every means to find and utilize substitutes, then it is easier to solve. Today's report in this newspaper on the practice of the Nanzhan District Warehouse in Jiangxi Province is worth learning from all over the country. Of course, starting with indigenous methods does not mean sticking to old ways; as long as conditions permit, we should continuously improve and adopt more advanced and modern methods.
    To make technological innovation continuously consolidated and improved, it is also necessary to do a good job in evaluation, appraisal, and promotion. Evaluation is to establish banners and select models, so as to achieve the purpose of mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths, and making common progress. There are many innovations and creations of employees, but what is the effect? This requires practice, mass appraisal, or assistance from relevant scientific departments for appraisal, before a conclusion can be drawn, and then it can be widely promoted. If it is promoted without appraisal, it is blind promotion, which can easily cause waste. After evaluation and appraisal, once the good ones are affirmed, promotion becomes a very important task.
    Due to the continuous emergence of innovative tools, the proficiency of employees in operating and using tools must also be improved accordingly, otherwise, it will also affect the promotion and popularization of work. Not only should the proficiency in operating and using tools be improved, but also the manual operating skills should be actively improved. Some people think that commercial work is just some trivial administrative work, but it is not. The operation of many industries has unique technologies. Recently, commercial systems in Heilongjiang, Beijing, Liaoning, Jilin and other places have launched a wave of business skill training competitions among salespersons and service personnel, and a large number of sales experts and service experts have emerged, which has played a major role in improving the operating skills and business proficiency of the majority of employees. While promoting advanced manual operation methods, we should also pay attention to appropriately adopting a combination of manual operation and tool machinery, so that better results can be achieved.
    Commercial technological revolution and technological innovation are also a process of struggle between the advanced and the backward. Therefore, to do this work well, we must also correctly understand the relationship between politics and technology. It is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership, conduct in-depth socialist and communist education among employees, and enable the majority of employees to dare to create actively and boldly. At the same time, we must adhere to the mass line and launch a mass movement, because commercial employees are the most familiar with the specific business and technology of commerce, and only commercial employees can most deeply appreciate the problems that urgently need to be innovated in all links of commercial work. Therefore, as long as we go deep into the masses, support and encourage the creativity of the masses, and help solve the specific difficulties in innovation, creation, and promotion, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can be fully exerted, and the movement can develop step by step.

    掀起商业技术革新的新高潮
    本报评论员
    商品流通过程，也就是商业职工的劳动过程。要做好商业工作，除了不断改善服务态度，改善经营管理和劳动组织以外，还要不断改进工具设备和操作技术，以减轻职工的劳动强度，提高工作效率，加速商品流通，更好地为消费者服务。
    一年来，商业职工在党的领导下，随着红旗运动的深入和发展，在收购、销售、调运、储存各个工作环节上大力开展了技术革命和技术革新运动。各行各业出现了成千项革新和创造，很多笨重的劳动或复杂的操作方法，正在被效率更高的工具、机械和先进操作方法所代替。商业职工的干劲愈来愈大，热情愈来愈高，技术革命和技术革新运动正在一浪接一浪地不断向深广发展，商业工作的面貌也在日新月异地改变着。
    今年商业工作无论是商品的收购、销售与运输、储存，工作量都比去年增加不少。人民群众对饮食、理发等服务行业，也提出了更高的要求。原有商业部门的人力、工具和设备，已不能完全与不断增长的任务相适应。在这种情况下，只有迅速地提高劳动效率，力争一个人干的活抵得上两个人、几个人干的活，才能多快好省地完成今年的商业任务。要做到这样，就要求全体商业职工，把技术革命和技术革新运动大力推向前进，创造和改进更多的先进工具和先进的操作方法，并把这些先进的工具和操作方法更多更好更快地推广开来。也许有的同志会说：人手少，任务大，哪有时间搞呢？这是把技术革新和当前繁重的任务对立起来了。事实证明，这二者是可以统一的。因为愈是任务大了，人员不足，时间紧迫，才愈要依靠在各个环节上开展技术革新，推广新工具和先进操作技术，提高劳动效率。也就是说，愈是任务重，愈要开动脑筋，苦干、实干加巧干。
    商业技术革新是贯串在商品流转过程各个环节中的革新运动，既要遍地开花，又要与当时当地的各种商业工作的中心任务结合起来。这就是说，要从实际出发，需要什么，就革新什么；哪里需要最迫切，就先从哪里革新。否则，就会脱离形势、脱离实际、脱离群众，不能达到革新的目的。
    如何解决原料、材料问题，是当前推广革新工具工作的一个重要问题。这个问题解决的好，方向对头，革新、创造和推广工作就能向前发展，否则就会停滞不前。解决这个问题是不是很困难呢？那要看用什么方法；如果不顾条件，只想搞最先进的工具，需要很多钢材和电力，那就比较困难，因为钢材和电力等都是当前国家建设最需要的。如果能够认真发动群众，因地制宜，就地取材，自力更生，千方百计寻找和利用代用品，那就比较容易解决。今天本报发表的江西省南站区仓库的做法就值得各地学习。当然，土法入手不等于故步自封，只要有条件就应不断提高，采用更先进的现代化的方法。
    要使技术革新不断巩固和提高，还要搞好评比、鉴定和推广工作。评比是为了树立旗帜、选拔样子，以达到互相学习、取长补短、共同提高的目的。职工的革新创造很多，其效果究竟如何？这就需要通过实践，经过群众鉴定，或经有关科学部门协助鉴定，才能作出结论，然后再普遍推广。如果不经过鉴定，即使推广，也是盲目推广，很容易造成浪费。经过评比鉴定，好的被肯定下来以后，推广就成了非常重要的工作。
    由于革新工具的不断出现，职工操作和运用工具的熟练程度，也必须相应的提高，否则，也会影响推广和普及工作。不仅要提高操作和运用工具的熟练程度，还应积极改进、提高手工操作技术。有些人认为商业工作都是一些琐碎的事务性的工作，其实不然，很多行业的操作具有独特的技术。最近黑龙江、北京、辽宁、吉林等地商业系统在广大营业员、服务员中掀起业务技术练兵竞赛高潮，涌现出大批售货能手和服务能手，对提高广大职工群众的操作技术和业务熟练程度，起了重大作用。在推广手工先进操作方法的同时，还应该注意适当采用手工操作和工具机械相结合的方法，这样可以取得更好的效果。
    商业技术革命和技术革新，也是先进和落后的斗争过程。因此，作好这一工作，还必须正确认识政治和技术的关系。要加强党的领导，在职工中进行深入的社会主义和共产主义教育，使广大职工敢于积极的、大胆的创造。同时，还要坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动，因为商业职工是最熟悉商业具体业务和技术的，也只有商业职工才最能深刻地体会商业工作各个环节所急待革新的问题。因此，只要深入群众，支持和鼓舞群众的创造，帮助解决革新创造和推广中的具体困难，群众的积极性和创造性就能得到充分发挥，运动也就能一步高一步的向前发展。
