　　Between Industry and Commerce
　　By our reporter Guo Fenxiang
    Not long ago, several general merchandise stores in Lanzhou launched a "Good Service" campaign. Salespersons tried every means to better serve the people's lives. They put a few chairs in the stores, prepared cooled boiled water, so that customers who had just run in from the hot sun could rest comfortably before choosing the goods they needed; some stores implemented "delivery to the door"; salespersons actively improved their service attitude, guaranteeing "tireless in answering questions, tireless in handling goods."
    However, during the "Good Service" campaign, the salespersons in the shoe departments of these stores encountered some troublesome issues: many customers who came to buy cloth shoes could not find shoes in the right size; some customers found shoes of the right size, but were not satisfied with the style and quality of the cloth shoes from the Xihu Shoe Factory. The salespersons wanted to make up for the defects of the goods themselves with their enthusiasm and patient explanations. The result was often watching customers come happily and leave disappointed. Once, a customer even brought a pair of shoes made by the Xihu Shoe Factory, which had come unstitched after only seven days of wear, to the Yongchang Road Department Store to request an exchange...
    These situations were reported to the general merchandise wholesale store. Some people believed that they had already given the Xihu Shoe Factory their opinions in the past, asking them to improve quality and increase variety, but they had not improved, so this was the factory's responsibility. However, the wholesale store's Party branch believed that, in the "Good Service" campaign, truly establishing the idea of serving the people and improving service attitude was only one aspect; another aspect was to establish the viewpoint of serving production, helping factories improve product quality, increase variety, and reduce costs, so as to fundamentally meet the needs of customers.

        Going to the Factory
    In early June, the secretary of the Party branch of the general merchandise wholesale store, Yang Maode, and the manager, Yang Wenhe, went to the Xihu Shoe Factory. That day, the shoe factory director was in a meeting. When he heard that people from the wholesale store had come, he thought they were just there to urge delivery of goods, so he sent someone out to say hello and continued the meeting. When Secretary Yang and Manager Yang went a second time, the factory director was again in a meeting, so they didn't have a good talk. It wasn't until Secretary Yang and Manager Yang went for the third time that the shoe factory leaders sat down with them for a sincere conversation.
    The shoe factory leaders' attitude towards the wholesale store负责人 on the first two occasions reflected their dissatisfaction with the wholesale store. In the past, the wholesale store had stipulated troublesome receiving procedures. No matter how urgently the retail stores needed goods, the factory had to pack the shoes themselves and send them to the wholesale store's warehouse for inspection and pricing, which took four or five days. The wholesale store also did not consider that the shoe factory had a weak foundation and poor conditions, and only asked for this and that without helping to solve difficulties. Individual salespersons were also overbearing, saying things like, "If I had known your shoes were so bad, I wouldn't have wanted them."
    Secretary Yang and Manager Yang then took action to remove these obstacles affecting cooperation between industry and commerce, expressing their determination to change their work style, implement "two arrivals" (sending invoices and payments to the factory, sending commercial personnel to the factory regularly to work alongside the workers), "four on-site services" (on-site purchase, on-site inspection, on-site allocation, on-site settlement), to help the shoe factory develop production.
  Secretary Yang and Manager Yang also went to the workshop to work alongside the workers, to understand and help the shoe factory solve problems in production. During their work, they realized that the key to the limited variety and unattractive styles of the shoes lay in the shoe lasts. The Xihu Shoe Factory lacked lasts for making women's shoes, and the existing shoe lasts were too old-fashioned, resulting in shoes that were large at the toe and fat in the body, which were not beautiful. They also found that manual twisting of hemp thread was inefficient and wasteful of labor.
    After Secretary Yang and Manager Yang returned to the wholesale store, they immediately organized more than ten waste collection salespersons to collect wood for making shoe lasts, and quickly bought a thousand catties of old pear wood, which was made into dozens of new styles of men's and women's shoe lasts for the shoe factory. The salespersons also borrowed a drawing of a hemp thread twisting machine from another shoe factory and rushed to make one to send to the Xihu Shoe Factory. Later, the shoe factory also imitated ten machines, and the production efficiency was increased by six or seven times compared to manual work. The original one hundred and thirty hemp thread twisting workers in the factory have now been reduced to twenty, and the released labor force has been strengthened in other production links.
    Yang Maode and Yang Wenhe also assisted the shoe factory in establishing a quality inspection system and launching a high-quality, high-yield competition. From then on, the shoe factory no longer had substandard products leaving the factory.

          "Customer Representative"
    Salesperson Kong Yinhai, from the day the wholesale store and the shoe factory were linked, became the wholesale store's resident representative at the shoe factory. Usually he worked alongside the workers in the shoe factory, and sometimes he also acted as a "purchaser," purchasing urgently needed raw materials for the shoe factory. He often went to the textile wholesale store to inquire about the arrival of goods, and immediately informed the shoe factory when he found new fabrics suitable for making shoes. He often went to department stores to understand market conditions and customer requirements, and reported them to the shoe factory. Therefore, he was also a "consultant" for the production of the shoe factory workers and a "customer representative" in the workshop.
    In late June, just as the shoe factory was rushing to produce a batch of cloth shoes urgently needed by the market, there was not enough hemp thread. Kong Yinhai immediately rode his bicycle back to the department store wholesale store and purchased more than a thousand catties of hemp in time. Seeing that there were many out-of-towners in Lanzhou, he went to the wholesale store's business department to select several new styles of slippers from other places for the shoe factory to refer to. One day, Kong Yinhai specially wore a pair of new cloth shoes from Shanghai to the shoe factory workshop to solicit everyone's opinions on the style. The staff praised them in unison. He compared the Shanghai shoes with the shoe factory's own soles, and immediately found that the heels of the shoe factory's soles were slightly square and too large, so they were not beautiful. They then modified the heel style with reference to the Shanghai shoes.

      Factory Director Behind the Counter
    After the leading cadres of the wholesale store worked alongside the workers in the shoe factory, the director of the shoe factory and the workshop主任 also came to the department store to work behind the counter.
    Soon after the factory director stood behind the counter, a customer came with a child to buy medium-sized shoes. When the customer saw that there were only large-sized shoes, he said disappointedly, "Why does the shoe factory only make adult shoes and not think about the children?" In the half day he worked alongside the workers, he encountered five or six customers who wanted to buy medium-sized shoes.
    In the past, the shoe factory was unwilling to make medium-sized shoes because adult shoes had a larger output value. Judging from the customer's reaction, the past practice was to be divorced from the masses. After returning to the factory, the factory director held an emergency meeting and decided to change the past practice of "making whatever we give you" and implement "make whatever the market wants." They immediately rushed to make hundreds of pairs of medium-sized shoes to meet the needs of the market.

        Everyone is Happy
    After the Lanzhou General Merchandise Wholesale Store implemented the policy of serving production and closely linked with the Xihu Shoe Factory, the shoe factory's production changed with each passing day. In the past, the factory only produced two styles of shoes, but now it has increased to more than forty styles; in the past, the shoe factory failed to complete its production tasks every month, but in the first month after the hookup, the shoe factory exceeded its plan, and the output value and output were more than the sum of the previous two months. The quality of the shoes has improved, and the cost has also been reduced by 5%. Before the hookup, the factory only produced more than 3,000 pairs of shoes per month, because the quality was poor and the style was old, the products are still unsalable; after the hookup, in June, the output increased sharply to 8,000 pairs, which were quickly sold out.
    The salespersons have noticed that the expressions on the faces of customers who have recently come to buy cloth shoes from the Xihu Shoe Factory have undergone significant changes. Some praised the quality of the soles, and some expressed satisfaction with the style of the shoes. Looking at the customers' smiles, the salespersons were also happy.

    不久以前，兰州市几个日用百货门市部开展了服务良好运动。营业员想尽办法，力争更好地为人民生活服务。他们在商店里放上几把椅子，准备下凉开水，让刚从烈日下跑来的顾客先舒舒服服地休息一下，再去挑选需要的商品；有些门市部实行了“送货上门”；售货员都积极改进服务态度，保证做到“百问不厌，百拿不烦”。
    然而就在服务良好运动中，这些商店售鞋部的售货员们碰到了一些伤脑筋的事情：不少来选购布鞋的顾客买不到尺码合适的鞋子；有些顾客挑到了大小合适的鞋子，但是对西湖制鞋厂的布鞋式样和质量不满意。售货员们想用自己的热情和耐心的解释来弥补商品本身的缺陷。结果却常常眼巴巴地看着顾客高兴而来，败兴而去。有一次，一个顾客还提着一双西湖制鞋厂出品、只穿了七天就脱线的鞋子，跑到永昌路百货商店要求调换……。
    这些情况反映到日用百货批发商店。有的人认为，过去已经给西湖制鞋厂提过意见，让他们提高质量，增加花色品种，他们没有改进，这是厂方的责任。批发商店党支部却认为，在服务良好运动中，切实树立为人民服务的思想，改进服务态度，只是一个方面；另一方面还要树立为生产服务的观点，帮助工厂提高产品质量，增加花色品种，降低成本，这样才能从根本上满足顾客的需要。
        到工厂去
    6月初，日用百货批发商店的支部书记杨茂德、经理杨文鹤到西湖制鞋厂去。那天，鞋厂厂长正在开会，听说批发商店来了人，心想无非是来催货一类的事，叫人出去打了个招呼，又继续开会。杨书记和杨经理第二次去时，厂长又在开会，结果又没有好好谈一谈。直到杨书记和杨经理第三次去时，鞋厂领导才同他们坐下来恳切交谈。
    前两次鞋厂领导干部对批发商店负责人的态度，反映了他们对批发商店的不满。过去批发商店规定了麻烦的收货手续，不管门市部要货多急，都要厂方自己装箱，把鞋送到批发商店库房去验收和计价结算，一等就是四、五天。批发商店也不考虑鞋厂底子薄，条件差，光伸手要这要那，而不帮助解决困难。个别业务员还盛气凌人，说什么“早知道你们的鞋这样糟糕，干脆不要了”。
    杨书记和杨经理便动手来扫除影响工商协作的这些障碍，向厂方表示决心改变作风，实行“二到”（开票送款到厂，派商业人员定期到厂跟班劳动）、“四就”（就厂收购，就厂验收，就厂分拨，就厂结算），帮助鞋厂发展生产。
  杨书记和杨经理还到车间去跟班劳动，了解和帮助鞋厂解决生产中的问题。他们在劳动中意识到，鞋子花色品种不多、式样难看的关键在鞋楦上。西湖制鞋厂缺少做女鞋的楦头，现有的鞋楦式样太旧，做出的鞋子头大身肥，不美观。他们还发现手工拧麻线效率太低，浪费人力。
    杨书记和杨经理回到批发商店以后，马上就组织十多个收购废物的业务人员分头去收集制鞋楦的木料，很快买来了一千斤老梨木，为鞋厂制成几十种式样新颖的男女各式鞋楦。营业员还从别的制鞋厂借来拧麻线机图样，赶制了一台送给西湖制鞋厂。后来鞋厂又仿制了十台，生产效率比手工提高六、七倍，全厂原有一百三十多名拧麻线的工人，现在减少到二十人，抽出的劳动力加强了其他生产环节。
    杨茂德和杨文鹤还协助鞋厂建立质量检查制度，开展优质高产竞赛。从此，鞋厂就不再有不合格的产品出厂了。
          “顾客代表”
    营业员孔银海，自从批发商店和鞋厂挂上钩的那天起，就成了批发商店在鞋厂的驻厂员。平时他在鞋厂里跟班劳动，有时还当“采购员”，为鞋厂采购急需的原料。他常到纺织品批发商店打听到货消息，发现适合制鞋的新颖布料，立刻告诉鞋厂。他常到百货商店去了解市场情况和顾客的要求，反映给鞋厂。所以他又是制鞋工人生产上的“顾问”，车间里的“顾客代表”。
    6月下旬，正当鞋厂赶制一批市场急需的布鞋时，麻线不够了。孔银海立即骑了自行车，赶回百货批发商店，及时采购回上千斤麻。他看到兰州外来人多，就到批发商店营业部挑选了几种外地出的新式样的便鞋，给鞋厂参考。有一天，孔银海特意穿了一双上海出的新布鞋到制鞋车间征求大家对式样的意见，职工们同声赞美。他就把上海出的鞋同本厂自制的鞋底叠在一起比较，一比就发现本厂的鞋底后跟略带方形，也过分肥大，所以不美观。他们便参考上海的鞋子修改了鞋跟式样。
      厂长站柜台
    批发商店的领导干部到鞋厂跟班劳动以后，鞋厂厂长和车间主任也到百货门市部来跟班劳动了。
    厂长站到柜台边不久，就有一位顾客带着孩子来买中人鞋。这个顾客一看只有大尺寸的鞋，便失望地说：“为什么鞋厂光做大人鞋，不为孩子们想想呢？”他跟班劳动半天，就碰到五、六个顾客要买中人鞋。
    鞋厂过去因为做大人鞋产值大，不肯做中人鞋。从顾客的反应看，过去的做法是脱离群众的。厂长回厂以后召开了紧急会议，决定改变过去“做啥给啥”的作法，实行“市场要啥，厂里做啥”。他们立即赶制了几百双中人鞋，供应了市场的需要。
        皆大欢喜
    兰州日用百货批发商店贯彻为生产服务的方针，同西湖制鞋厂密切挂钩以后，鞋厂的生产日新月异地变化着。过去这个厂仅生产两种式样的鞋子，现在已增加到四十多种式样；过去鞋厂月月完不成生产任务，挂钩后的第一个月，鞋厂就超额完成计划，产值和产量都比前两个月的总和还多。鞋子的质量提高了，成本也降低了5％。挂钩以前，这个厂每月只生产三千多双鞋，因为质量差，式样老，产品至今销不完；挂钩以后的6月份，产量激增到八千双，都很快售完了。
    售货员们发觉，近来选购西湖制鞋厂的布鞋的顾客，脸上的表情有了显著的变化。有的称赞鞋底的质量，有的对鞋子的式样表示满意。看着顾客们的笑容，售货员们也高兴了。
