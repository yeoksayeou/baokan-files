Welcome, Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe
    Xiang Yu

    The serfs, bent over by heavy stones, moved their legs with difficulty, laboring under the threat of whips. The master holding the whip fiercely lashed a serf who had lost his grip due to exhaustion. But the arrow, with its string drawn taut, was finally shot out, and the serf owner, along with his whip, was eliminated. That powerful drawing action symbolized the new life gained by the Tibetan compatriots in the Ganzi area under the leadership of the Party. This is one of the excellent programs, "Arrow Dance," performed by the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe on the evening of the 1st. Although the plot in the dance is simple, it also aroused a strong reaction from the audience with its unique moving power.

    In June of this year, professional art troupes in Sichuan held a successful performance in Chengdu. I was fortunate enough to watch this performance and was pleased to see that the Sichuan colleagues had created many excellent music and dance programs to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. At that time, I thought that if these programs appeared on the stage in Beijing, they would surely emit their unique brilliance. I told this idea to the responsible comrade who was in charge of the performance. Now, my wish has come true. Judging from the enthusiastic atmosphere of the theater and the very few exceptions to the encore performances, the audience greatly appreciated this performance.

    The Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe brought several very outstanding dance programs from the performance.

    "Liangshan Wine Dance" sings a hymn of heroes with vigorous movements and the mimicry of eagles. There are not many dance programs that express such bravery and power. "Happy Lusu" is a completely different mood: light movements and rapid rhythm make the whole stage vibrate, expressing an incomparable joyful mood. There have been many dances with such content in the past, but it will give you a sense of freshness, expressed in ways you wouldn't expect. "Presenting Felt to Chairman Mao" expresses the desire of the people to turn into little swans (using hands and felt to make the appearance of little swans, which is extremely similar and beautiful), and send the best felt woven by themselves directly to Beijing. This is precisely the wish of hundreds of millions of people across the country, expressed in this dance with a romantic approach, which is very poetic. The above three are all dances of the Yi ethnic group. In addition, the song and dance troupe also performed Xiushan Flower Lantern "Breaking Through the Colored Gate," which describes the members of the commune competing for advancement and boosting morale. The creation of these excellent programs is the result of the Sichuan provincial dance artists correctly implementing the Party's literary and artistic policy, going deep into life, and inheriting and developing the traditions of national dance.

    In addition to dance, the troupe's large and small chorus, duet, solo, folk music ensemble, solo, and even the unique Sichuan Qingyin are all excellent. The level of the orchestra can also be heard from the accompaniment of the large chorus. "Emei Suite" (composed by Du Tianwen) and the "Sichuan Northern Red Army Base Area" chorus (composed by Yang Qing) will meet the audience successively. Xiao Shunyu is a nationally renowned Qingyin singer, and Zeng Manlin's "Worshiping the Moon" has won praise in the provincial performance with its affectionate and delicate singing. Chen Hualu and Li Shuhua are excellent folk singers, and their singing allows us to appreciate the very distinctive Sichuan folk songs. Sichuan folk songs also have a part that is rich in melodic beauty, such as "Picking Flowers," but what is different from folk songs in other provinces and particularly characteristic is the part that expresses the characteristics of Sichuan language, is full of life interest and even humorous, such as "Crab Song," "Antiphonal Mountain Song," etc. However, precisely because it uses Sichuan dialect, and is sometimes close to recitation, it takes more listening to deeply understand its true flavor. This is probably like appreciating Sichuan opera, it takes a process. Ma Shengbang (song title "Chasing Wild Cats"), who plays the flute solo, and the young comrade Li Kegui, who has a dulcimer solo in the ensemble, both have very good skills. The ensemble "General's Order" was discovered and organized by the old artist Li Decai from the Sichuan Quyi dulcimer. If it is further developed, it can become a very good folk music ensemble piece.

    "Balance Modeling" is a dance-like acrobatic program, with a harmonious and beautiful picture. Fifteen-year-old Liu Xiaoling and eighteen-year-old He Tianpang performed many beautiful movements that combine soft skills and martial arts. Their profound skills are enough to be admired. Later, He Tianpang lay supine on the ground, and on her raised legs, Liu Xiaoling suddenly rotated left and right, tumbling up and down. They also performed various amazing stunts. The ingenuity of the conception and the excellence of the skills are truly rare in acrobatic art. This is one of the most popular programs of the entire evening. When it was performed to the most wonderful point, the audience exclaimed several times. This effect is rare in my experience of watching many Chinese and foreign acrobatics performances. It should also be mentioned that the music accompaniment of the acrobatics, like all the dance accompaniments on the evening, is relatively rich.

    Thank you to the comrades of the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe for bringing us Sichuan-flavored art specialties. At the same time, I hope that such touring performances will be promoted throughout the country. I believe it will be of great benefit to the prosperity of our country's multi-ethnic and colorful socialist literature and art.

    欢迎你，四川省歌舞演出团 
    向隅
    农奴们被沉重的石头压弯了身子，艰难地移动两腿，在皮鞭的威胁下劳动着。手持皮鞭的主人狠狠地抽打一个因过度疲劳而失了手的农奴。但是，扣紧了弦的箭终于射了出去，农奴主连同他的鞭子一起被消灭了。那有力的拉弦动作象征了甘孜地区的藏胞在党的领导下获得新生。这就是四川省歌舞演出团1日晚上精彩节目之一的“弓箭舞”。舞蹈中的情节虽然简单，但也以其特有的感人力量激起了观众的强烈反应。
    今年6月间，四川省的专业艺术团体在成都举行了一次成功的会演。我有幸去观摩了这次会演，满意地看到四川的同行们为迎接国庆十周年创造了不少优秀的音乐舞蹈节目。当时我在想，这些节目如果出现在北京的舞台上，一定也会放出它特异的光彩吧。我把这个想法告诉了主持会演的负责同志。现在，我的愿望实现了。从剧场的热烈气氛和加演节目极少例外的情形看来，观众是十分欣赏这次演出的。
    四川省歌舞演出团这次带来了会演中几个非常出色的舞蹈节目。
  “凉山酒舞”以矫健的动作和鹰的拟态唱出了英雄的颂歌。舞蹈节目里面表现的像这样勇武有力的还是不多的。“快乐的噜苏”又完全是另一种情调：轻快的动作和急速的节奏使整个舞台跳动起来，表现了一种无比欢乐的情绪。这样内容的舞蹈过去已经有了不少，但它会给你以清新之感，用你所意想不到的方式表达出来。“披毡献给毛主席”是表现人们想变成小天鹅（用手和披毡来做成小天鹅的样子，真是像极了，也美极了），把亲手织成的最好的披毡直接送到北京来。这正是全国亿万人民的心愿，在这首舞蹈中以浪漫主义手法表现出来，非常富有诗意。上面这三个都是彝族的舞蹈。此外歌舞团还演出了秀山花灯“闯彩门”，内容是写公社社员们比先进，鼓干劲。这些优秀节目的产生，是四川省舞蹈艺术家们正确执行党的文艺方针，深入生活，继承和发展民族舞蹈传统的结果。
    除了舞蹈以外，演出团的大小合唱、对唱、独唱、民乐合奏、独奏，以至别具风格的四川清音都包括在内，都是出色的。从大合唱的伴奏中也能听出管弦乐队的水平，“峨嵋组歌”（杜天文作曲）与“川北红军根据地”大合唱（杨青作曲）将陆续同观众见面。萧顺瑜是全国闻名的清音歌唱家，曾曼琳的“拜月”以其深情细腻的演唱在全省会演中博得好评。陈华禄和黎淑华是优秀的民歌手，他们的演唱使我们能欣尝到非常有特点的四川民歌。四川民歌中也有富于曲调美的一部分如“采花”，但异于他省民歌而格外有特点的是表现四川语言特征，富于生活情趣甚至是很有幽默感的另一部分民歌如“螃蟹歌”、“对山歌”等。不过正因为用了四川方言，有时还接近朗诵，是要多听才能深深领会其真味的，这恐怕也像欣尝川剧一样要有一个过程。担任笛子独奏的马生庞（曲名“撵野猫”）和合奏中有一段扬琴独奏的青年李克贵同志都有非常好的技巧，合奏“将军令”是老艺人李德才从四川曲艺的扬琴中发掘整理的，如再加以发展，可以成为一个很好的民乐合奏曲。
    “平衡造型”是一个舞蹈性的杂技节目，画面和谐而优美。十五岁的刘小玲和十八岁的何天庞表演了许多柔术结合武功的优美动作，功夫之深已够使人惊服了。演到后来，何天庞仰卧地上，在她举起的双腿上，刘小玲忽然左右旋转，上下翻腾起来。又表演了种种惊人的绝技，构思之巧与技艺之精，在杂技艺术中实在不可多得。这是整个晚会上最受欢迎的节目之一，演到绝妙处观众几次失声惊呼起来，这种效果在我看过的许多中外杂技表演经历中是很少有的。还要提到的是，杂技的音乐伴奏，也像晚会上所有的舞蹈伴奏一样，是比较丰富的。
    感谢四川省歌舞演出团的同志们给我们带来了四川风味的艺术特产，同时也希望这样的巡回演出在全国推广起来，相信它会对繁荣我国多民族的，各呈异彩的社会主义文艺有极大的好处。
