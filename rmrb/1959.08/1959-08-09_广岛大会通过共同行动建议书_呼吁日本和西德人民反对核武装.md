Xinhua News Agency, Hiroshima, August 8th: The Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs passed a proposal on the principles, goals, and joint actions of the international movement against nuclear weapons on the evening of the 7th. It also called on the people of West Germany and Japan to condemn the actions of arming their own territories with nuclear weapons.

The proposal pointed out that nuclear-weapon-free zones, including these countries, would be a major step in resolving their national issues; West Germany's equipping with atomic weapons would only make the reunification of Germany more difficult.

The proposal pointed out that the act of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" means arming Japan with nuclear weapons, which will increase the danger of war in the Far East and endanger world peace.

The proposal expressed opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke government's recent decision on the second arms expansion plan, and supported the just trial of the Tokyo District Court on the "Sunakawa Incident," which held that the U.S. military's stationing in Japan violated the Japanese Constitution. The proposal also opposed the implementation of the notorious new Okinawa Criminal Code and the transformation of Okinawa Island into a nuclear base, and supported the movement to return Okinawa to Japan.

The proposal opposed turning the U.S. bases in Iwakuni and Sunakawa into nuclear weapons bases, and demanded the formulation of special relief laws for atomic bomb victims. It suggested designating October as a month for action against nuclear armament, launching a large-scale movement to demand that the Japanese Diet declare Japan a country that does not possess nuclear weapons.

The proposal suggested designating September 1st as an International Day of Common Action, in order to hold conferences across the country demanding an early summit meeting.

    广岛大会通过共同行动建议书
    呼吁日本和西德人民反对核武装
    新华社8日讯　广岛消息：第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会7日晚上通过了关于反对核武器的国际运动的原则、目标和共同行动的建议书，并且呼吁西德和日本人民谴责把自己的国土用核武器武装起来的行动。
    建议书指出，包括这些国家在内的无核武器区将是解决它们的民族问题的重大步骤；西德配备原子武器的做法只会使重新统一德国的工作更加困难。
    建议书指出，修改日美“安全条约”的行动是意味着用核武器武装日本，这种做法将在远东增加战争危险并且危及世界和平。
    建议书表示反对岸信介政府最近决定的第二次扩军计划，并且支持认为美军驻在日本是违反日本宪法的东京地方裁判所对“砂川事件”的公正审判。建议书还反对实行臭名昭彰的冲绳新刑法和将冲绳岛变为核基地，并且支持将冲绳交还给日本的运动。
    建议书反对将美国在岩国和砂川的基地变为核武器基地，并且要求制订对原子弹受害者的特别救济法。它建议以10月为反对核武装行动月，展开大规模的运动来要求日本国会宣布日本是不拥有核武器的国家。
    建议书建议订9月1日为国际共同行动日，以便在全国各地举行大会，要求早日召开最高级会议。
