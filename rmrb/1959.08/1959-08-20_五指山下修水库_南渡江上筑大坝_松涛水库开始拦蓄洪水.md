Building a Reservoir at the Foot of the Wuzhi Mountains, Constructing a Dam on the Nandu River
　　Songtao Reservoir Begins Impounding Floodwaters

　　(Our dispatch) One of the nation's large-scale reservoirs, the Songtao Reservoir in Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, has recently completed its first phase of construction. By this point, the reservoir's dam, which spans the Nandu River, has been filled to a height of 170 meters above sea level, reaching a safe height capable of withstanding once-in-a-century extraordinary floods.

　　The Songtao Reservoir is located on the upper reaches of the Nandu River, Hainan's largest river, at the foot of the Wuzhi Mountains. It is a key to developing the northwestern region of Hainan Island. Once the entire dam project is completed, it will be able to store rainwater from a 1,400-square-kilometer area in the upper reaches of the Nandu River. The reservoir's capacity will reach 2.9 billion cubic meters, not only fundamentally eliminating the threat of floods in the lower reaches of the Nandu River but also providing ample water resources to more than 3.6 million mu of arid wasteland in the western and northern parts of Hainan Island, transforming them into fertile farmland and a good base for developing tropical and subtropical cash crops. At the same time, it will also be able to generate 60,000 kilowatts of electricity, creating conditions for further development of industrial and agricultural production in the region.

　　Construction of the Songtao Reservoir began in July of last year, and dam filling began in November. By August 5th of this year, through the efforts of the builders, several barren mountains near Songtao had been leveled, and the stones were transported to the Nandu River to form a dam. The construction of the diversion tunnel was also completed, ensuring that the dam was built to a safe height before the arrival of the flood season.

　　Currently, the second phase of the Songtao Reservoir project has commenced, and tens of thousands of reservoir builders are working with full enthusiasm to continue striving for the early completion of the entire reservoir construction project.

　　五指山下修水库　南渡江上筑大坝
　　松涛水库开始拦蓄洪水
    本报讯　全国大型水库之一——广东省海南岛松涛水库，最近完成了第一期工程。至此，这个横贯在南渡江上的水库拦河大坝，已经填筑到拔海一百七十米高，即达到了可以挡住百年一遇的特大洪水的安全高度。
    松涛水库位于海南最大的河流南渡江上游的五指山下，是开发海南岛西北部地区的一把钥匙。大坝的整个工程完成后，可以把南渡江上游一千四百平方公里面积的雨水蓄存起来，水库的容量将达到二十九亿立方米，不仅能根本免除了南渡江下游地区的洪水灾害，而且使海南岛西、北部地区三百六十多万亩干旱的荒坡地，获得充分的水源，变成肥沃的农田和发展热带和亚热带经济作物的良好基地。同时，还能发出六万瓩的电力，为这个地区进一步发展工农业生产创造了条件。
    松涛水库在去年7月开始施工，11月开始填坝，到今年8月5日，经过建设者们的努力，终于削平了松涛附近的好几座荒山，把山石搬到南渡江上结成大坝，并完成了导流隧洞的建设，抢在洪水到来之前，把大坝建到安全高度。
    现在，松涛水库的第二期工程已经开工，数万水库建设者们正在鼓足干劲，为提早完成整个水库的建设工程而继续努力。
