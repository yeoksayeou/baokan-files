　　Deep Friendship
　　Head of the Sino-Polish Friendship Association Delegation to Poland
　　Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Wang Weizhou
    At the kind invitation of the General Council of the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association, the delegation of the Sino-Polish Friendship Association made a twenty-four-day visit to beautiful Poland. These were unforgettable twenty-four days. Although the time was short, thanks to the careful arrangements of the hosts, we went to eight provinces, visited the heroic Warsaw, the industrial city of Lodz with its revolutionary traditions, the shipbuilding city of Gdansk, Poland's granary Poznan, Wroclaw, which has seen rapid recovery and great development after the war, beautiful Opole, Poland's mining center Katowice, and Poland's ancient capital and cultural center Krakow. The delegation not only toured Poland's beautiful rivers and mountains but also visited rural areas, factories, and mines, met with working people and intellectuals, and everywhere saw the vigorous development of Poland's socialist construction. The delegation was honored to participate in the grand celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic. On July 22, the people of Warsaw held a grand parade, reviewing their achievements and strength. We were excited to see the mighty lineup of the Polish People's Army, the sons and daughters of the Polish people; we saw the workers' ranks full of radiant faces and high spirits, with the pride of being masters of their own affairs; we saw healthy and lively Polish teenagers, taking light steps, waving to the Party and state leaders on the podium, revealing their love for the Party and the country. We are proud of the development of the Polish People's Republic.
    During our visit to Poland, the Soviet Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev was visiting various parts of Poland. The rock-solid Soviet-Polish friendship gave us great encouragement.
    During our delegation's twenty-odd days of visiting, we personally witnessed the labor enthusiasm and heroic spirit of the broad masses of Polish workers and farmers in the cause of socialist construction, whether in the factory workshops or in the rural fields. In the past, we had heard many times about the monstrous crimes of the German fascists in destroying Warsaw, and we had also heard many times about the heroic deeds of the Polish people in rebuilding Warsaw at an astonishing speed. This time, we saw Warsaw with our own eyes. Although the enemy had carried out inhumane destruction in Warsaw, killing nearly 600,000 Warsaw residents, destroying 85% of the city's economy, and turning more than 11,000 buildings into ruins, the heroic Warsaw was not erased from the map. It stands firmly on the Vistula River and is more beautiful and magnificent than ever! According to the new plan, in the next few years, more new factories will appear here, hundreds of thousands of houses will be built, and there will be more schools, theaters, cinemas, parks, and sanitary facilities. The reconstruction process of Warsaw most vividly demonstrates the precious character of the Polish people's heroism and diligence, and also clearly shows the great achievements of People's Poland. From here, we saw the epitome of the entire People's Poland. We are proud to have such a Warsaw, and we are proud to have such a brother—the Polish people.
    During our visit to Poland, we saw that the Polish United Workers' Party enjoys high prestige among the broad masses of the Polish people. After liberation, under the leadership of the Polish working-class party, the Polish people completed democratic reforms, defeated domestic and foreign reactionary forces, overcame various difficulties in economic construction, and developed industry at a rate of 10% per year, while agricultural production was also gradually increasing. Through a series of arduous efforts and heroic and tenacious struggles, Poland has long since changed its backward and impoverished economic outlook and has become a socialist country with advanced industry. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of Poland and its government, the people's living standards have greatly improved. Polish comrades told us that in the past three years, the wages of workers in Polish state-owned enterprises have increased by 25%, and new houses are being built everywhere. We visited the new workers' city of Nowa Huta, which grew up after the war, and the large area of workers' housing in the Krakow Lenin Metallurgical Combine, and saw that every worker's family had bright and clean windows and fresh air. Only in a socialist country where the workers are the masters of their own affairs can the working class obtain such good living conditions, which fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.
    The past fifteen years have been a period of earth-shaking changes in Polish history. The achievements made by the Polish people under the leadership of the Polish working-class party are enormous. However, the Polish people, like the people of other socialist countries, are not satisfied with their existing achievements, and they are fighting to achieve greater achievements. The Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, held in March this year, formulated a plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965. This plan further shows a bright and splendid prospect for Poland's socialist construction. In factories and mines, enterprises and farms all over Poland, we heard people excitedly talking about the glorious prospects shown by the "Three Greats," and saw the Polish people striving to realize the seven-year plan. Everywhere there is a new wave of construction, and considerable achievements have been made. Many factory and enterprise leaders told us that when their enterprises complete the seven-year plan, they will be able to increase production by one to several times compared to the current level with only a slight increase in personnel or even no increase in personnel. The number of agricultural groups is also gradually increasing. When people talk about their achievements, they attach great importance to the leading role of the Polish United Workers' Party. They believe that under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, and with the mutual assistance of the fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, Poland will surely be built into a prosperous and strong socialist country.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Polish people is developing day by day. Wherever the Sino-Polish Friendship Association delegation went, Polish comrades and friends welcomed us with flowers and the most enthusiastic words, regarding us as envoys of the Chinese people, making us, the guests from afar, feel completely at home. Many local party and government leaders personally accompanied us on our visits and earnestly engaged in conversations with us. Workers, farmers, artists, and social activists in many places expressed enthusiastic concern and good wishes for the struggles and construction of the Chinese people. All these facts deeply moved us. From Beijing to Warsaw, from the shores of the Yellow Sea to the coasts of the Baltic Sea, there are thousands of miles apart, but the friendship of proletarian internationalism closely links the hearts of our two peoples together. Our friendship is as deep as the Yellow Sea and the Baltic Sea.
    For a long time, the Chinese people have had deep feelings for the Polish people. In the past, the Chinese and Polish people encouraged and supported each other during the hard years of fighting against domestic and foreign enemies. However, only when the people of our two countries have taken power into their own hands and embarked on the common road of socialism can the friendship between us be fully developed. Because we have a common ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism, a common goal of building socialism and communism, and we are all members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the friendship between our two peoples is forever as solid as a rock and unbreakable. In recent years, the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, and cultural fields are developing and consolidating day by day. The successive establishment of the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association and the Sino-Polish Friendship Association is a result of the continuous development of the friendly unity between our two peoples, and also a sign that this friendly unity will be further developed. As early as 1950, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The increasingly close cooperation between China and Poland in politics, economy, and culture is not only beneficial to the people of the two countries, but will also further strengthen and consolidate the camp of world democracy and peace." We will continue to make unremitting efforts to strengthen the friendly unity between the people of the two countries.
    This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people are greeting this festival with excitement and selfless labor. As we review the construction achievements of the past decade, we are deeply grateful for the selfless assistance given by the people of the Soviet Union, Poland, and other socialist countries. The Polish people have always supported our country's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose US imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan. In order to help our country's socialist construction, the Polish people have provided fraternal assistance, supplying our country with steel, machine tools, transportation equipment, agricultural machinery, and chemical fertilizers needed for the development of industry and agriculture, and have given our country great assistance in factory design, training of technical personnel, and ocean shipping. We visited the machine tool factory in Lodz, the farm implement manufacturing factory in Poznan, and the motor manufacturing factory in Wroclaw, where the workers have sweated to support our country's industrial and agricultural construction. The Chinese people will never forget this fraternal friendship. At the same time, we can say that in the construction and struggle of the Polish people, the Chinese people will never spare their strength as long as there is a need. We are willing to work with the Polish people to further strengthen the friendly relations between the Chinese and Polish peoples, the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to continue to strive to further consolidate the cause of world peace.
    Long live the friendship between China and Poland!

　　深厚的友情
　　中波友好协会访波代表团团长
　　中国共产党中央委员会委员　王维舟
    中波友好协会代表团应波中友好协会总会的盛情邀请，在美丽的波兰作了二十四天的参观访问。这是难忘的二十四天。时间虽短，但是由于主人的精心安排，我们到了八个省，访问了英雄的华沙、富有革命传统的工业城罗兹、造船业发达的海港城市革但斯克、波兰的粮仓波兹南、战后获得迅速恢复和巨大发展的弗罗茨瓦夫、美丽的奥波莱、波兰的矿业中心卡托维兹，还有波兰的古都和文化中心克拉科夫。代表团不仅游览了波兰的美丽河山，还访问了农村、工厂和矿山，同劳动人民和知识分子见了面，到处看到波兰社会主义建设在蓬勃发展。代表团荣幸地参加了波兰人民共和国国庆十五周年的庆祝大典。7月22日那一天，华沙的人民举行了盛大的游行，检阅了自己的成绩和力量。我们激动地看到波兰人民的子弟兵——波兰人民军的强大阵容；看到工人阶级的队伍中人人容光焕发，精神饱满，带着主人翁的自豪感，我们看见健康活泼的波兰青少年，迈着轻快的步伐，在向主席台上的党和国家领导人挥手致敬，流露着对党和国家的热爱。我们为波兰人民共和国的发展而感到骄傲。
    在我们访问波兰期间，恰值以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团在波兰各地访问。坚如磐石的波苏友谊，给予我们以极大的鼓舞。
    我们代表团在二十几天的参观访问中，不论在工厂的车间里，还是在农村的田野中，都亲眼看到了波兰广大工人、农民在社会主义建设事业中的劳动热情和豪迈气魄。过去，我们曾经多次地听到关于德国法西斯毁坏华沙的滔天罪行，也曾多次地听到过波兰人民以惊人的速度重建华沙的英雄事迹。这次，我们亲眼看到了华沙。尽管敌人曾经在华沙进行了灭绝人性的破坏，杀害了华沙居民近六十万人，使全市85％的经济遭到破坏、一万一千多幢房屋变成废墟，但是英雄的华沙并没有从地图上被抹掉，它坚强地屹立在维斯杜拉河边，而且比过去任何时候都更加美丽，更加雄伟！而根据新的计划，在今后几年内，这里将出现更多的新工厂，将建造起几十万间住宅，将有更多的学校、戏院、电影院、公园和卫生设备。华沙的重建过程，最鲜明地显示了波兰人民的英勇勤劳的可贵性格，也鲜明地表明了人民波兰的伟大成就。从这里我们看到了整个人民波兰的缩影。我们以有这样的华沙而骄傲，以有这样的兄弟——波兰人民而骄傲。
    在波兰访问期间，我们看到，波兰统一工人党在波兰广大人民群众中间享有崇高的威信。解放后，波兰人民在波兰工人阶级政党的领导下，完成了民主改革，打败了国内外反动势力，克服了经济建设中的种种困难，使工业以每年增长10％的速度发展，农业生产也在逐步提高。通过一系列的艰巨努力和英勇顽强的斗争，现在波兰早已改变了经济上落后和贫穷的面貌，而成为一个具有先进工业的社会主义国家。由于波兰和政府的不懈努力，人民生活水平有了很大提高。波兰同志告诉我们，最近三年波兰国营企业工人的工资增加了25％，新的住宅到处在兴建。我们参观了战后成长起来的新的工人城诺维德赫和克拉科夫列宁冶金联合企业的大片工人住宅，看到工人家庭个个窗明几净，空气新鲜。只有在工人当家作主的社会主义国家里，工人阶级才能获得这样好的生活条件，这也充分地表明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    过去的十五年，是波兰历史上一个翻天复地的变革时期，波兰人民在波兰工人阶级政党领导下所取得的成就十分巨大。然而，波兰人民如同社会主义各国人民一样，他们并不满足于现有成绩，他们在为取得更大的成就而斗争。今年3月间召开的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会，制订了1959—1965年发展国民经济的计划。这个计划进一步为波兰的社会主义建设事业展示了光辉灿烂的前景。我们在波兰各地的工厂和矿山，企业和农场，到处听到人们在兴奋地谈论“三大”所展示的辉煌远景，看到波兰人民在为实现七年计划而奋斗。到处是一片新的建设热潮，并且取得了相当大的成绩。不少工厂企业的负责人告诉我们，他们的企业要在七年计划完成的时候，只要增加少许的人员甚至不增加人员就可以使生产量比目前增加一倍到几倍。农业小组的数目也在逐步增加。人们在讲述自己的成就时，非常重视波兰统一工人党的领导作用，他们相信在波兰统一工人党的领导下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的相互帮助之下，一定能够把波兰建成为一个富强的社会主义国家。
    中波两国人民之间的友谊正在日益发展。中波友好协会代表团所到各处，波兰同志和朋友都用鲜花和最热情的话语欢迎，把我们看作是中国人民的使者，使我们这些远方的客人，完全像生活在自己的家里一样。许多地方党政领导同志亲自陪同我们参观，恳切地同我们进行交谈。许多地方的工人、农民、艺术家、社会活动家，普遍地对于中国人民的斗争和建设表示热情的关怀和美好的祝愿。所有这些事实都使我们深深感动。从北京到华沙，从黄海之滨到波罗的海海岸遥隔万里，但是无产阶级国际主义的友谊，把我们两国人民的心紧紧地连在一起。我们的友情就像黄海和波罗的海一样深。
    长久以来，中国人民对波兰人民就有着深厚的感情。中波两国人民过去曾经在反对国内外敌人的艰苦斗争岁月里互相鼓舞、互相支持。但是，只有当我们两国人民都把政权掌握在自己的手里，都走上共同的社会主义道路的时候，我们之间的友谊才获得充分发展的条件。由于我们有着马克思列宁主义的共同思想基础，有着建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目标，我们都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员，我们两国人民之间的友谊是永远坚如磐石，牢不可破的。近几年来，我们两国之间在政治、经济、文化各方面的友好团结和互助合作关系，正在日益发展和巩固。波中友好协会和中波友好协会的相继成立，就是我们两国人民友好团结不断发展的一个结果，也是这种友好团结将获得进一步发展的一个标志。早在1950年毛泽东同志就说过：“中波两国在政治、经济、文化上的益加密切的合作，不仅有利于两国人民，而且将会更加加强与巩固世界民主和平的阵营。”我们将继续坚持不懈地为加强两国人民的友好团结而努力。
    今年是中华人民共和国成立十周年，中国人民正在以兴奋的心情和忘我的劳动来迎接这一节日。在我们检阅十年来的建设成就的时候，我们对苏联、波兰以及其他社会主义各国人民所给予的无私帮助，怀着深深感激之情。波兰人民一向支持我国维护国家主权、反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的斗争。波兰人民为了帮助我国的社会主义建设，提供了兄弟般的援助，供给了我国发展工农业所需的钢材、工作母机、运输设备、农业机器和化学肥料，并且在设计工厂、训练技术人员和远洋航运等方面给了我国很大帮助。我们参观了罗兹的机床厂、波兹南的农具制造厂和弗罗茨瓦夫的电机制造厂，那里的工人曾经为支援我国的工农业建设而流过汗。中国人民对于这种兄弟情谊将永志不忘。同时，我们可以说，在波兰人民的建设和斗争中，只要有需要，中国人民也决不吝惜自己的力量。我们愿意同波兰人民一起，为进一步加强中波两国人民的友好关系，和以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，为进一步巩固世界和平事业而继续奋斗。
    祝中波友谊万古长青！
