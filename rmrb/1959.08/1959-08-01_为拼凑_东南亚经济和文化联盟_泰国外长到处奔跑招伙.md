Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 30th - Thai Foreign Minister Nai Thana Khoman arrived in Saigon from Bangkok today. He will discuss with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities the piecing together of the so-called "Southeast Asian Economic and Cultural Alliance" and the issue of forcing overseas Vietnamese in Thailand to go to South Vietnam.

Under the instigation of the United States, Nai Thana has recently visited some neighboring countries to organize the "Southeast Asian Economic and Cultural Alliance". Before and after this, when Malaysian Prime Minister Razak and Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya visited Thailand, the Thai authorities discussed the issue of organizing this "alliance" with them. According to Nai Thana's disclosure to the press on July 8, he and Malaysian Foreign Minister Ismail, who visited Thailand with Razak at the end of June, had discussed the issue of organizing this "alliance". Both sides decided that Thailand would be responsible for drafting a draft organization of the "Southeast Asian Economic and Cultural Alliance", which would then be sent to various Southeast Asian countries for "review" in order to take further concrete measures. According to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Thai Foreign Minister has now drafted the "alliance's" organizational draft.

    泰国外长到处奔跑招伙
    据新华社30日讯　西贡消息：泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼今天从曼谷到达西贡。他将同吴庭艳当局讨论拚凑所谓“东南亚经济和文化联盟”和强迫旅泰越侨前往南越的问题。
    乃他纳在美国指使下为组织“东南亚经济和文化联盟”，最近刚访问了一些邻国。在这前后，当马来亚联合邦总理拉扎克和老挝外交大臣坎番·班雅访问泰国时，泰国当局和他们都谈到了组织这个“联盟”的问题。据乃他纳7月8日向报界透露，他在6月底和与拉扎克一同访问泰国的马来亚联合邦外交部长伊斯梅尔曾经商谈过有关组织这个“联盟”的问题，双方决定由泰国负责起草一分“东南亚经济和文化联盟”组织草案，然后分别送交各东南亚国家“审查”，以便更进一步采取具体措施。据泰国外交部透露，泰国外交部长现在已经拟好了“联盟”的组织草案。
