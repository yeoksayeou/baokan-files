The meeting fully discussed these reports and made corresponding resolutions.

　　When summarizing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over the past year, the meeting pointed out that the achievements of the socialist construction Great Leap Forward in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1958 were great, bringing about major and profound changes in the material and spiritual outlook of the autonomous region. In the first half of 1959, industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings have made great progress. In terms of industrial production, the region's pig iron output in the first half of the year was 77.5% of the total output for the entire last year, steel output was 87.5% of the total output for the entire last year, and raw coal output increased by 1.4 times compared with the same period last year. The total output value of light industry increased by 106% compared with the same period last year, and the amount of timber shipped out in the first half of the year increased by 42.1% compared with the same period last year. In terms of agriculture, the region completed a sowing area of 68 million mu, of which 8 million mu of spring wheat has already had a bumper harvest, and the autumn crops are growing well, with a bumper harvest in sight.

　　The meeting emphasized that 1959 is a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle and a year in which the autonomous region will continue to achieve a leap forward in socialist construction. Now there are only five months left, and the tasks in the next five months are arduous. The current task facing the people of all nationalities in the autonomous region is to earnestly sum up experience on the basis of the achievements already made, continue to go all out, carry out the nationwide increase production and practice economy campaign more extensively and deeply, continue to take active and effective measures, and comprehensively fulfill and over fulfill the national economic plan centered on the five major indicators of steel, coal, grain, livestock, and timber, and launch a greater production upsurge.

　　The meeting put forward specific tasks for the autonomous region's future capital construction, industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, commerce, transportation, cultural and educational health, and other work, and believed that the current situation in the autonomous region is very good, with many favorable conditions. It is entirely possible to complete the above tasks and achieve this year's continued leap forward. However, at present, a small number of cadres have underestimated the great achievements and rich experience already gained in their work, exaggerated some difficulties in their work, and ignored the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, mistakenly believing that the lower the planned targets, the better. This is a right-leaning slackening mood that deserves serious attention and must be resolutely criticized and overcome. The meeting pointed out that August and September are the decisive moments for completing this year's leap forward plan. It is necessary to closely rely on the leadership of the Party, make full use of favorable conditions, go all out, overcome right-leaning emotions, boldly mobilize the masses, and launch a greater upsurge in the increase production and practice economy campaign.

　　This meeting was held in Hohhot from August 4th to 11th, with 333 representatives of people of all nationalities, including Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Man, participating.

    内蒙古自治区人代会号召各族各界人民
    乘胜前进　把增产节约推向更高潮
    新华社呼和浩特14日电　11日闭幕的内蒙古自治区第二届人民代表大会第二次会议，号召全区各族各界人民立即行动起来，以增产节约的辉煌成就迎接国庆十周年，为实现1959年社会主义建设的继续跃进而奋斗。
    会议首先听取了内蒙古自治区副主席杨植霖以“总结经验，鼓足干劲，为实现1959年继续跃进而奋斗”为题的政府工作报告，以及其它报告。对这些报告，会议进行了充分地讨论，并作出了相应的决议。
    会议总结自治区一年多来大跃进的成就时指出，1958年内蒙古自治区社会主义建设大跃进的成就是伟大的，使自治区的物资和精神面貌发生了重大而深刻的变化。1959年上半年，工农业生产和各项建设事业，又取得了很大进展。工业生产方面，上半年全区生铁产量为去年全年产量的77.5％，钢的产量为去年全年产量的87.5％，原煤产量比去年同期增长一点四倍。轻工业总产值比去年同期增长106％，上半年运出的木材比去年同期增长42.1％；农业方面，全区完成播种面积六千八百万亩，其中八百万亩春小麦已经丰收，大秋作物生长良好，丰收在望。畜牧业方面，幼畜已成活七百六十五万只，比去年增殖了二百一十五万只。总之，上半年自治区国民经济的发展是迅速的，整个局势是一个继续跃进的局势。
    会议强调指出，1959年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，也是自治区社会主义建设继续实现跃进的一年。现在只剩下五个月了，在今后的五个月中，任务是艰巨的。当前摆在自治区各族人民面前的任务是，在已取得成绩的基础上，认真总结经验，继续鼓足干劲，把全民性的增产节约运动更加广泛深入地开展起来，继续采取积极有效措施，全面完成和超额完成以钢铁，煤炭、粮食、牲畜、木材等五大指标为中心的国民经济计划，掀起更大的生产高潮。
    会议对自治区今后的基本建设、工业、农业、畜牧业、商业、交通运输、文教卫生及其他各项工作，提出了具体的任务，并且认为，自治区目前的形势很好，有利的条件很多，完成上述任务，实现今年的继续跃进，是完全可能的。但是，目前有少部分干部，对工作中已经获得的伟大成绩和丰富经验估计不足，夸大了工作中某些困难，忽视了克服困难的有利条件，错误地认为计划指标越低越好。这是一种值得严重注意的右倾松劲情绪，必须坚决地批判和克服。会议指出，8、9两个月是完成今年跃进计划的决定性时刻。必须紧紧依靠党的领导，充分运用有利条件，鼓足更大干劲，克服右倾情绪，放手发动群众，掀起增产节约运动更大的高潮。
    这次会议是在8月4日到11日在呼和浩特市举行的，有蒙古、汉、回、满等各民族人民代表三百三十三人参加。
