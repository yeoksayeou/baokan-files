	Treating the Symptoms and Tackling the Root Cause Simultaneously

	The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Mechanical Industry has asked its affiliated enterprises to clean up the backlog of work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and finished products, and has put forward solutions. This is of great significance for accelerating the turnover of enterprise working capital and for leveraging the role of materials.

	The production of modern enterprises is often flow-like. As much material as is invested on one side, there should be a corresponding amount of finished products leaving the factory on schedule and in the correct quantity. But there are also situations where a lot of materials are invested, but very few can be turned into finished products on time, which shows that the enterprise's semi-finished products and work-in-progress are backlogged in the production process, or the finished products do not meet the specifications and cannot leave the factory. For such enterprises, the turnover of working capital is very slow.

	The backlog of semi-finished products, work-in-progress, and finished products, except for a portion that is of unqualified quality, can all be utilized. There are many reasons for the backlog. Some are due to changes in production tasks. Materials were invested and processed, but they have not yet become finished products. In order to tackle other more important tasks, they were put aside. Some are due to poor production arrangements. Too much of this type of parts material was invested, and too little of that type of parts material was invested, or the production coordination of off-site collaborative parts was not good, and in the end, some parts could not be matched. Some are due to inconsistent specifications. The parts have all become finished products, and the quality is not bad, but they are not suitable for the needs of the user departments and have to be placed in the warehouse. Therefore, the purpose of cleaning up backlogged work-in-progress, semi-finished products, and finished products is not just to count the numbers so that you have a clear idea, but more importantly, to utilize them through cleaning, accelerate the turnover of working capital, and better leverage the role of materials.

	It is of course good to be able to clean up and utilize backlogged items in a timely manner. However, this is only a symptomatic treatment, and we also need to address the root cause. The way to address the root cause is to find ways to prevent backlogs. Learn from experience. Through mobilizing the masses, find out the reasons for the backlog, which are objective and which are subjective, and then prescribe the right medicine and formulate several methods to avoid or reduce the backlog. In this regard, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Mechanical Industry's requirement that its affiliated enterprises establish and improve various management systems, such as quality inspection systems for raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, quota management systems, work-in-progress complete set management systems, raw material management and procurement systems, and working capital management systems, is a fundamental solution and is more worthy of promotion.

### 治标治本双管齐下

    治标治本双管齐下
    上海市机械工业局要求所属的企业，清理一次积压的在制品、半成品和成品，并提出了处理的办法。这对于加速企业流动资金的周转，对于发挥物资的作用，都有着极大的意义。
    现代企业的生产往往是流水式的，一边投了多少材料，一边就能够按期按数地有多少成品出厂。但也有这样的情况，投入的材料很多，而能够按时变成成品出厂的却很少，这说明企业的半成品、在制品在生产过程中被积压了，或者成品不合规格，出不了厂。这样的企业，流动资金就周转得很慢。
    积压的半成品、在制品和成品，除了一部分因为质量不合格的以外，都是可以利用的。积压的原因很多。有的是由于生产任务改变，投了料，加了工，但还没有变为成品，为了突击别的更重要的任务，才被搁到一旁去。有的是由于生产安排得不好，这种零件料投多了，那种零件料投少了，或者是厂外协作件的生产配合得不好，最后有些零件配不上套。有的是由于规格不符，零件都变成了成品，质量也还不差，只是不适合于使用部门的需要，不得不放在仓库里。所以清理积压的在制品、半成品和成品的目的，绝不仅仅是清点一下数目，使自己心中有数，更重要的是通过清理，把它们利用起来，加速流动资金周转，更好地发挥物资的作用。
    能够及时地清理和利用积压品，当然是好的。不过这毕竟是治标之道，还需要治本之道。治本之道是想办法不积压。经一事，长一智，通过发动群众，找出积压的原因，哪些是客观方面的，哪些是主观方面的，然后对症下药，订出几条避免或者减少积压的办法来。在这方面，上海市机械工业局要求所属企业，建立和健全各项管理制度，如原材料、半成品、成品的质量检验制度、定额管理制度、在制品成套管理制度、原材料管理和采购制度，以及流动资金管理制度等等的做法，是治本之道，是更值得提倡的。
