　  Sailboat Roller Bearing Conversion

　  In the aquatic transport brigade of Changhai County, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, 80% of the wooden sailboats have been converted to roller bearings for raising sails, saving more than one hundred people, reducing costs by half, and reducing accessory expenses by more than 1,500 yuan. The "sail" is the power source used by wooden sailboats to harness the wind, but in the past, raising the sail was a laborious task. Since replacing it with roller bearings, the boatmen can easily raise the sails, increasing efficiency by 25%. Now, the boatmen of this brigade are using their brains to strive for semi-mechanization of anchoring. (Li Sen)

　  起帆滚珠轴承化
    辽宁省旅大市长海县水上运输大队已有80％的木帆船实现了起帆滚珠轴承化，节省一百多人，成本降低一半，减少属具开支一千五百多元。“帆”是木帆船用来借风助航的动力，但过去起帆却是一项劳累的事。自从换上滚珠轴承后，船工们可以轻快地把帆拉起来，提高效率25％。现在，这个大队船工们正开动脑筋，争取实现起锚半机械化。　（李森）
