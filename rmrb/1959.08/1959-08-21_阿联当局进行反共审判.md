　　Xinhua News Agency, August 20th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" today published news about the United Arab Republic conducting anti-communist trials.

　　The news says that, according to a Reuters correspondent in Cairo, on August 15th, the Supreme Court for State Security Cases in Alexandria began a military trial of sixty-four UAR citizens, charged with joining the Egyptian Communist Party and "attempting to overthrow the government of President Nasser." Among the defendants are workers, office staff, university students, journalists, and progressive intellectuals, including Mursi Haddad, a professor in the Faculty of Law at Alexandria University. According to the Reuters reporter, he is considered a key figure in the trial.

　　The indictment is approximately 1,200 pages long, which insists that the defendants are participants in an underground organization. The "evidence" and "material evidence" submitted to the court include 7,000 books, pamphlets, and leaflets, claiming that these printed materials were published by Egyptian communists, in addition to 225 typewriters and other similar machines.

　　All the defendants were arrested by the police in the Egyptian region of the UAR during the so-called "anti-communist" arrests that began on New Year's Eve this year. Even before the trial, the Attorney General of the Republic, Hafez Sabek, demanded that they be sentenced to long prison terms.

　　The news says that the Cairo press is paying attention to the connection between the current trial and the anti-communist movement stirred up by reactionaries in the UAR.

    阿联当局进行反共审判
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联“真理报”今天刊载了关于阿拉伯联合共和国进行反共审判的消息。
    消息说，据路透社驻开罗记者报道，8月15日，亚历山大港审理国家安全案件的最高法庭开始对六十四名阿联公民进行军法审判，他们的罪名是加入埃及共产党。并“企图推翻纳赛尔总统的政权”。在被告中有工人、职员、大学生、新闻记者、有进步情绪的知识分子，其中包括亚历山大大学法律系教授穆尔西·哈达德。据路透社记者称，他被认为是这次审判中的一个主要人物。
    起诉书长约一千二百页，其中硬说，被告是地下组织的参加者。在提交法庭的“罪证”和“物证”中有书籍、小册子和传单共七千件，硬说这些印刷品是埃及共产党人出版的，此外还有二百二十五架打字机和其他类似的机器。
    所有被告都是在今年除夕开始的所谓“反共”逮捕时期在阿联埃及地区被警察逮捕的。还在审讯之前，共和国总检察长哈菲兹·萨贝克就要求判处他们长期徒刑。
    消息说，开罗报界正在注意着目前的审讯同反动派在阿联挑起的反共运动的联系。
