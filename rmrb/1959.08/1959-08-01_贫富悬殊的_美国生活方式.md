    The Stark Disparity of Wealth in the "American Way of Life"
    By Soviet Writer F. Zhukov

    "So much has been said and written about the prosperity of the United States that almost everyone (both in our America and abroad) seems to think that every American has a two-story house and a luxury car, that they eat well, dress well, and can enjoy medical treatment. But many facts prove that many, many manual laborers do not even have these concepts of material welfare, health care, and rest."

    These words come from the American newspaper "Washington Post." The newspaper asks, "Who are these people who never appear in any films or magazines depicting American life?" In the words of this newspaper, these are workers, farmers, all those who create the country's material wealth with their own labor.

    American propagandists talk a lot about the high standard of living of the "average American." So, who is this "average American"?

    If we judge by the speeches of American statesmen, it seems that American industrial workers are closest to this standard. According to them, the average weekly wage of industrial workers is about ninety dollars. They also assert that people with such an income are fully secure in America.

    Is this really the case? We have in hand the fourteenth issue of "American Labor Fact Book," compiled by the American Labor Research Association, published not long ago. Now let us look at the materials published in this collection.

    First, how do Americans with a weekly income of ninety dollars live? A survey by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) answers this question. According to these materials, a family can maintain a week's life on these ninety dollars if they spend it in the following way:

    Buy less than half a liter of milk;

    No more than one egg per person per day for an average family of four;

    Use the payphone no more than three times a week (excluding private phones);

    Take a vacation only once every three or four years.

    If even seemingly ordinary foods like eggs and milk have to be carefully calculated, then what about things like televisions and five-room houses? A weekly budget of ninety dollars is almost always in the red.

    A chart compiled by the American "Peacock Publishing Company" confirms this conclusion. According to this chart, the family budget of an American with a slightly higher income (one hundred dollars a week) is roughly as follows:

    Taxes and rent - $50.40;

    Transportation - $10.00.

    It can be seen that taxes, rent, and transportation account for 60% of the budget. The remainder is mostly spent on food.

    The head of such a family cannot even dream of giving their children higher education. It should be known that according to official survey materials, the cost of a college student, including tuition, is about fifty dollars a week.

    Can such a family easily afford household appliances such as electric refrigerators (worth $220.75), televisions (worth $195.98), electric sewing machines (worth $180.00), and gas stoves (worth $173.80)?

    According to calculations by the Federal Reserve Board of the United States government, in September 1958 there were approximately sixty million families in the United States. Among them:

    4.55 million families, or 8% of the total number of families, had an annual income of no more than one thousand dollars.

    11.95 million families (21%) had an annual income of less than two thousand dollars.

    18.208 million families (32%) had an annual income of less than three thousand dollars.

    25.605 million families (45%) had an annual income of less than four thousand dollars.

    It must also be remembered that these income figures do not include taxes. Taxes sometimes account for one-third of the family budget.

    More than half of American families do not even belong to the ranks of those "happy people" with an annual "income" calculated at ninety dollars a week. According to data from the U.S. Government Census Bureau, 1.3 million families live in abject poverty with only $500 a year. It should be mentioned that even American statistics regard an annual expenditure budget of two thousand dollars as a threshold, and those below two thousand dollars are actually in a state of chronic death due to hunger.

    This is one end of American society: one-tenth of families, whose income accounts for only 1% of the total income of American families. And at the opposite end: one-tenth of American families live a life of extravagance.

    According to the American magazine "Fortune", there are 155 people in the United States, each of whom has more than 50 million dollars in property. This means that each of these financial oligarchs has an annual income of no less than one million dollars. The magazine listed 76 of the richest people, whose private property is worth more than 75 million dollars. According to the magazine's estimate, the Rockefeller family's property is worth two billion dollars.

    This chasm between millionaires and destitute people is a prominent feature of the "American way of life."

### 贫富悬殊的“美国生活方式”

    贫富悬殊的“美国生活方式”
    苏联弗·茹科夫
    “关于美国的繁荣，讲的和写的已经如此之多，以致几乎是到处（在我们美国以及国外都是一样）都有很多人认为，好像每一个美国人都有一幢二层楼房和一辆豪华的汽车，他们吃得饱、穿得好，还能享受医疗待遇。但是，好多事实证明，很多很多从事体力劳动的人，甚至没有这些物质福利、卫生保健和休息的概念。”
    这段话是美国报纸“华盛顿邮报”说的。这家报纸问道：“这些在任何描绘美国生活的电影、杂志上都没有露面的人，究竟是些什么人呢？”用这家报纸的话来说，这就是工人、农民，所有用自己的劳动创造国家物质财富的人。
    美国的宣传家关于“中等美国人”的高度生活水平讲得很多。那末，这种“中等美国人”是些什么人呢？
    如果根据美国国务活动家的发言来判断，似乎美国的产业工人看来最接近这个标准。用他们的话来说，产业工人的平均周工资约为九十美元。他们并且断言，有这样一笔收入的人，在美国生活完全有保障。
    果真如此吗？我们手头有不久以前出版的美国工人调查协会编印的第十四期“美国劳动资料汇编”。现在我们看一下这本集子里刊载的材料。
    首先，每周收入九十美元的美国人如何生活呢？美国工会联合组织劳联—产联所作的调查，回答了这个问题。根据这些材料，一个家庭如果照下面的开支办法，可以靠这九十美元维持一周的生活，这就是：
    购买不足半公升的牛奶；
    平均四口之家每天每人不超过一个鸡子；
    每周使用自动电话不超过三次（自备电话除外）；
    三、四年只去休养一次。
    如果连鸡子和牛奶这些看来是普通的食品，都不得不精打细算，那末还能谈得上什么电视机和五间一套的住宅之类的东西吗？每周九十美元的预算几乎是入不敷出的。
    美国“孔雀出版公司”编的一览表，证实了这个结论。根据这个一览表，一个收入稍多一点的（每周一百美元）美国人的家庭预算，大致如下：
    纳税和房租——五十点四美元；
    交通费——十美元。
    由此可见，纳税、房租和交通费就占预算的60％。余下的大部分则花在吃饭上面。
    这种家庭的家长根本不能幻想让自己的子女受高等教育。要知道，根据官方调查的材料，一个大学生包括学费在内的开支，大约是每周五十美元。
    这样的家庭能否轻易买得起像电气冰箱（价值二百二十点七五美元）、电视机（价值一百九十五点九八美元）、电动缝纫机（价值一百八十美元）、煤气炉（价值一百七十三点八美元）这些家庭用品呢？
    根据美国政府联邦后备局计算，1958年9月美国大约有六千万个家庭。其中：
    四百五十五万家，即占家庭总数的8％，每年收入不超过一千美元。
    一千一百九十五万家（21％）年收入在二千美元以下。
    一千八百二十万零八千家（32％）年收入在三千美元以下。
    二千五百六十万零五千家（45％）年收入在四千美元以下。
    这里还必须记住，这些收入的数字还没有扣除税金。税金有时要占家庭预算的三分之一。
    一多半的美国家庭甚至不属于那些每周按九十美元计算的年“收入”的“幸福人”行列。根据美国政府国情普查局的资料，有一百三十万的家庭，过着每年只有五百美元的赤贫生活。应该提到的是，甚至美国的统计资料也把每年开支预算二千美元看作一个界限，低于二千美元的实际上会因饥饿而陷于慢性的死亡。
    这就是美国社会的一端：十分之一的家庭，其收入只占美国家庭总收入的1％。而相反的另一端：十分之一的美国家庭，过着奢侈无度的生活。
    据美国“幸福”杂志报道，美国有一百五十五人，他们每个人的财产在五千万美元以上。这就是说，这些金融寡头之中的每个人，年收入都不下于一百万美元。这家杂志列举了七十六个最富有的人，他们的私人财产在七千五百万美元以上。据这家杂志估计，洛克菲勒家族的财产值二十亿美元。
    这种百万富翁和贫困无告者之间的天渊之别，就是“美国生活方式”的突出的特点。
