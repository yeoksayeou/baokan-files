Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 14th: According to newspaper reports, after the dissolution of the Kerala State government led by the Communist Party of India, landlords in some parts of Kerala have begun to evict tenants and abuse farmers who support the Communist Party. According to the Press Trust of India, the current government of Kerala has amended some of the controversial clauses of the Kerala Education Act.

However, a reporter from "The Statesman" reported that the working people of Kerala, including the four million-strong Ezhava community, still firmly support the Communist Party there. There have also been changes in the personnel of the state government. The former Inspector General of Police was transferred because agitators disliked him. The new positions established in the police department by the former government and the promotions of some personnel have also been revoked. The central government has sent advisors to the governor and will remain there.

According to newspaper reports, the original opposition parties and other forces in Kerala are now beginning to organize electoral alliances in order to participate in the new elections.

The "Times of India" reported on the 13th that the leader of the Kerala State Congress Committee, Shankar, will come to Delhi to consult with the highest leadership of the Congress Party on the issue of forming a united front with the People's Socialist Party and the Muslim League. The "Indian Express" reported on the 14th that the President of the Congress Party, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, emphasized on the 13th that the parties and groups that jointly worked to bring down the Communist government of Kerala should stand together in the future elections. The exact date for the re-election in Kerala has not yet been announced.

The Chief Election Commissioner of India, Sundaram, has visited Kerala. He made some adjustments to the electoral rolls and constituencies. The latest issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly said that Congress Party election expert Patil may be sent to Kerala to organize the Congress Party's election campaign.

　　印共领导的邦政府被解散后
　　喀拉拉邦马上变样
　　劳动人民坚决支持共产党
    新华社新德里14日电　据报纸报道，印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府被解散以后，在喀拉拉邦的一些地方，地主已经开始把佃户赶走，并且虐待支持共产党的农民。据印度报业托辣斯说，喀拉拉邦的现政府已经修改了喀拉拉邦教育法的某些引起争论的条款。
    但是“政治家报”记者报道，喀拉拉邦的劳动人民，包括四百万埃兹哈瓦斯教族仍旧坚持支持那里的共产党。邦政府的人事也已经有了变动。前警察总监被调走。因为煽动分子不喜欢他。前政府在警察部门设立的新职位和对一些人员的提升也都被撤消了。中央政府已经给邦长派去了顾问，并且将留在那里。
    据报纸报道，喀拉拉邦原来的反对党和其它势力现在开始组织选举联盟，以便参加新的选举。
      “印度时报”13日报道，国大党喀拉拉邦委员会领袖山卡尔将到德里来同国大党最高领导机构商洽关于同人民社会党、穆斯林联盟结成联合阵线的问题。“印度快报”14日报道，国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人13日强调说，共同努力使喀拉拉邦共产党政府下台的各党派和集团，要在未来的选举中站在一起。在喀拉拉邦重新举行选举的确实日期还没有宣布。
    印度选举委员会主任委员松达拉姆曾经访问了喀拉拉邦。他对选举名册和选区作了某些调整。最近一期的“德里时代”周刊说，国大党的选举专家帕蒂尔可能被派去喀拉拉邦组织国大党的选举运动。
