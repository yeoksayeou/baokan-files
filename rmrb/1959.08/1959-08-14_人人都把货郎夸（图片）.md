Everyone Praises the Peddler
　　Resisting drought urgently, resisting drought busily, the peddler delivers goods to the countryside. Tools are delivered to the field ridges, and salt is transported to the public canteens. Cigarettes and liquor taste delicious, and sweets and pastries are sweet and fragrant. Not carrying an empty load, collecting waste products, both selling and buying, running around in all directions. Supporting drought resistance has a great effect, everyone praises the peddler.

　　人人都把货郎夸抗旱紧，抗旱忙，货郎送货下了乡。工具送到田坎上，食盐运到大食堂。纸烟白酒味鲜美，糖果糕点甜又香。担不空回收废品，连卖带买跑四方。支援抗旱作用大，人人都把货郎夸。
