　　“As long as everyone works together…”
　　——Visiting Veszprém, an advanced state in agricultural cooperation
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie
Veszprém County is located in western Hungary, next to the "Hungarian Sea" - Lake Balaton. Since the beginning of this spring, the agricultural cooperation movement here has developed very rapidly, with 95% of farmers joining cooperatives and embarking on the road of socialist collectivization.

　　Huge changes
When we arrived in Veszprém City, the capital of the county, Comrade Pap János, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, first introduced us to the development of agricultural production cooperatives.

At the end of last year, there were 81 agricultural production cooperatives in Veszprém County, with cultivated land accounting for only 6% of the county's total cultivated area, and a total of 2,500 members.

During the cooperative upsurge this spring, five of the seven districts in the county completed agricultural cooperation, and 224 of the county's 266 villages have become cooperative villages. There are now 267 agricultural production cooperatives, with 95% of farmers joining the cooperatives, totaling more than 36,000 members. The socialist component of agriculture now accounts for more than 85% of the cultivated area.

After the formation of the new cooperatives, thanks to the efforts of all members and the strong support of the government in political and economic aspects, a foundation for collective management was quickly laid. Many excellent cadres and agronomists were sent to work in the cooperatives. After democratic discussions, the farmers elected the leaders of the cooperatives, and with the help of Party and government cadres, state farm and agricultural machinery station leaders, and technical personnel, they promptly adjusted the land, formulated production plans, and organized the labor force.

The County Party Secretary said that the Party has strengthened political work in rural areas, established Party organizations in the newly established cooperatives, and recruited a group of outstanding laboring farmers into the Party, carried out propaganda and education work, promptly dispelled some ideological concerns of the farmers, and exposed various rumors spread by the enemy to sabotage cooperation.

The factories, enterprises, state farms, agricultural machinery stations in this county, as well as the staff and workers in the 10th district of Budapest, are separately responsible for providing new cooperatives with regular assistance in political and business management.

Animal husbandry also occupies a very important position in Veszprém County. The newly joined farmers brought more than 42,000 cattle and sheep into the cooperatives. Therefore, the construction of public livestock sheds is a very urgent issue. Farmers have used old materials and voluntary labor to build them, and the state has also provided a large number of loans and construction equipment. At present, this problem has been basically solved.

The county has ten agricultural machinery stations. By the end of last year, it had 500 tractors. This spring, it received nearly 200 more tractors and a batch of other agricultural machines. 80% of spring plowing and 60% of spring sowing were completed using machines. By the end of this year, the total number of tractors will increase to 1,000.

Comrade Pap János pointed out very excitedly that the organized farmers have very high labor enthusiasm. The spring plowing and sowing work this year has been better than in any year since liberation. The cultivation is very meticulous and timely, and the amount of chemical fertilizer used per Hold of land has almost doubled compared to last year. Due to the implementation of collective management, the proportion of sown area has also changed greatly: sugar beets have increased from 2,500 Holds last year to 4,500 Holds, and feed corn has more than doubled. It is estimated that this year's crop yield in this county will increase by 30% to 40% compared to last year.

　　A victorious start
We visited the agricultural production cooperative in Raz Village, Giltsi District. This cooperative was established on February 26th this year. All 252 households in the village joined the cooperative, with a total of 2,600 Holds of cultivated land.

The head of the cooperative, Comrade Német, is young and capable. He had been working in this village and was transferred to work in the district supply and marketing cooperative two years ago. When the village organized a cooperative in February, he was sent back to his hometown to work. All members unanimously elected this young man who is good at labor and management to be the head of the cooperative. Because he has performed very well in his work, the Party organization of the cooperative recently admitted him into the Party.

Agronomist Baunok was selected by the county's state farm to work in this cooperative. This agricultural expert with rich experience told reporters that he has decided to work here forever, determined to work with everyone to improve the production of the cooperative.

The 13 standing committee members of the cooperative, elected by the members' assembly, meet frequently and hold regular meetings of all members to jointly decide on various important issues of the cooperative.

In the short few months since its establishment, the cooperative has achieved great success in public construction and production.

Accompanied by the head of the cooperative and the agronomist, we visited the two livestock sheds expanded by the cooperative using old buildings and the two newly built livestock sheds with modern equipment. The 500 cattle and 110 horses brought into the cooperative by the farmers have all been raised in public livestock sheds and are growing very strong.

The cooperative has also built a pigsty that can accommodate 1,200 pigs and purchased 650 piglets.

In order to better develop animal husbandry, a large cow shed with various modern equipment is currently under construction, and this project can be completed soon.

Three weeks ago, the members built a very beautiful cultural palace using voluntary labor, and they are now designing to add tap water pipes.

The state has allocated a 30-year long-term loan of 3 million Forints (Hungarian currency) to this cooperative for construction, and a total of 2 million Forints in medium-term loans for other aspects with a term of 15 to 20 years.

Miners from nearby mines have taken a lot of time off to help them with construction. The staff and workers of the machine factory in the 10th district of Budapest, who are responsible for regularly assisting this cooperative, have also given the cooperative a lot of help in purchasing raw materials, repairing machines, and rural lighting. The state farm in the district is also very enthusiastic in regularly introducing production experience to the members and helping them improve cultivation methods.

The collectivized farmers have also seen significant changes in their cultural life. The cooperative has purchased a film projector and shows movies two or three times a week, so farmers can see new films from home and abroad in a timely manner. Actors from urban theaters also often come to the village's cultural palace to perform for the farmers. Now most households have radios. During leisure time, young people often organize football, volleyball, and table tennis competitions and various recreational activities.

Now the farmers throughout the village are working actively with full confidence of victory. They want to strive to provide the country with more agricultural products and build a better new socialist countryside. As the labor hero of the cooperative, Korah, told reporters: "As long as everyone works together, there is nothing that cannot be done."

　　Firm steps
The next day, we visited Shumeig District. When we entered the Party Committee office, Comrade Sharkeji, the Secretary of the District Party Committee, was talking with Nagy Lajosné, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Budapest "Gaibani" shoe factory, and the factory director, Romhányi István, to study how the factory could better assist the Shumeigqiexi Village Cooperative in establishing a Party organization, improving management, and successfully completing the summer harvest task.

The District Party Committee Secretary told reporters that the staff and workers in the 10th district of Budapest have given a lot of help to the organization and consolidation of cooperatives in this district. The factory leaders and staff often go to the cooperatives they are responsible for assisting to carry out political propaganda work, help develop Party members, establish Party organizations, and the staff also often take time out to help the cooperatives with public construction, which is a great political support and encouragement to the farmers.

Last year, there were only nine agricultural production cooperatives in this district, and the largest cooperative did not exceed 1,000 Holds of cultivated land. This spring, farmers in all 31 villages in the district joined the cooperatives, and all villages have become cooperative villages.

We visited many agricultural production cooperatives in this district with the District Party Committee Secretary, and everywhere we saw newly built cattle and horse sheds, and the crops in large fields were growing very well.

Of course, the rapid development of the cooperative movement has also brought some difficulties, but due to the strong support of the whole Party and the whole people and the efforts of the farmers, these difficulties have been overcome. The democratically elected leaders have initially familiarized themselves with their work, rationally organized labor, and won the first battle in spring plowing and sowing, showing the superiority of socialist collective management.

Last year, due to the mainly scattered individual management, the task of economic crops in this district was only 50% completed. This year, economic crops have increased more than threefold compared to last year, and the sown area of ​​vegetables has increased tenfold. Although the task has increased many times over, the members are very motivated and full of confidence.

Large-scale collective management has brought a broader field for the laboring farmers to display their creative talents. For example, Hegedüs, a production expert from Qisigelbo Village, was elected as the head of the cooperative, and Német, a farmer with rich animal husbandry experience, served as an animal husbandry technician. After successfully completing the spring plowing task, the farmers in the entire village are considering formulating long-term plans in order to develop production more rationally and rapidly.

　　Excellent example
On the last day, we visited the agricultural production cooperative in Quavage Village, Taboercha District. This cooperative was initially established in August 1950. Over the past ten years, it has grown from small to large, from poor to rich, and has achieved great success.

The head of the cooperative, Sebestye Gyula, and many old members gave us a detailed introduction to the development of this production cooperative.

When the cooperative was established in 1950, there were only 20 members, all poor and lower-middle peasants, with a total of 240 Holds of land, which were all distributed to these farmers during the land reform.

At that time, there were only two horses in the cooperative, and human and material resources were very scarce. There was even no office for the cooperative. Everyone discussed matters in the members' homes. However, the pioneers of cooperation overcame all difficulties with common wisdom and common efforts and organized collective labor. No one flinched or wavered.

By the end of 1958, the cooperative had made great progress in all aspects. The number of members increased to 206, and many middle peasants also joined the cooperative. The cultivated area of ​​the cooperative reached 1,600 Holds, and the public accumulation fund increased from 80,000 Forints at the end of 1954 to 3.4 million Forints.

With the development of production, the cash income of each member per work day increased from 8 Forints in 1951 to 55 Forints in 1958. In addition to cash, each household can also receive sufficient in-kind supplies. In the past year, there were six members with an income of 50,000 Forints, thirty with an income of nearly 40,000 Forints, and fifty with an income of around 30,000 Forints. The formerly poor farmers are now living a well-off life, and every family has savings, and 30 households have built new houses. The cooperative has also built two dining halls and opened a well-equipped nursery.

The cooperative has also built offices, clubs and stadiums.

The farmers in this village have not forgotten how they lived before liberation. In 1937, the largest landlord in Veszprém County occupied more than 100,000 Holds of land, and there were 99 landlords with more than 1,000 Holds, but 23,000 farmers did not have even an inch of land! The farmers worked barefoot for the landlords all year round, lived in cattle and horse sheds, and could not enjoy any human rights and the happiness of life. Therefore, when the counter-revolutionary riot occurred in October 1956, the cooperative members and laboring farmers in this village resolutely crushed the enemy's restoration conspiracy and defended the cooperative and the socialist system.

The achievements of the farmers' collective labor over the past ten years have eloquently proved the superiority of socialist large-scale management. This spring, all farmers in this village who had not yet joined the cooperative joined the cooperative. The farmers in this village also went to nearby villages to participate in the propaganda work of organizing cooperatives.

The spring plowing task here this year has also been completed very well. The number of livestock will double this year compared to last year, and each member's workday is expected to receive a cash income of 60 Forints.

In this village, we visited the cooperative's crops, machines, livestock sheds, chicken farms, and various buildings under construction with Comrade Pap János, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, who came to inspect the work. Comrade Pap János told reporters that the biggest feature of this cooperative is self-reliance. The members never rely on and wait for the help of the state. They work together, overcome all difficulties with their own hands, build a new life, and increase agricultural production for the country year by year.

　　“只要大家同心合力……”
　　——访农业合作化先进州维斯普雷姆
　　本报记者　王崇杰
    维斯普雷姆州位于匈牙利的西部，在“匈牙利海”——巴拉顿湖旁。今年开春以来，这里的农业合作化运动发展得非常快，95％的农民都入了社，走上了社会主义集体化的道路。
        巨大的变化
    当我们到达这个州的首府维斯普雷姆市时，州委第一书记帕普·亚诺什同志首先向我们介绍了农业生产合作社的发展情况。
    去年年底，维斯普雷姆州共有八十一个生产合作社，耕地面积只占全州总耕地面积的6％，社员共两千五百人。
    在今春的合作化高潮中，这个州的七个区有五个区已经全部完成了农业合作化，全州的二百六十六个村庄，有二百二十四个已变成了合作化村。现在共有二百六十七个农业生产合作社，95％的农民入了社，社员达三万六千多人，农业的社会主义成分已占耕地面积的85％以上。
    新合作社组成后，由于全体社员的努力和政府在政治、经济方面的大力支持，很快就奠定了集体经营的基础。很多优秀的干部和农艺师被派到合作社工作。农民们经过民主讨论选出了社的领导人，并在党政工作干部、国营农场和农业机器站的负责人、技术人员的帮助下，及时调整了土地，制订了生产计划，组织了劳动力。
    州委书记同志说，党加强了在农村的政治工作，在新成立的合作社里建立了党的组织，并且吸收了一批优秀的劳动农民入党，开展了宣传教育工作，及时解除农民们的一些思想顾虑，揭穿了敌人破坏合作化的各种谣言。
    这个州的工厂、企业、国营农场和农业机器站以及布达佩斯第十区的职工们分头负责在政治和经营方面给予新成立的合作社以经常的协助。
    维斯普雷姆州的畜牧业也占很重要的地位，新入社的农民带入社的牛羊达四万二千多头，因此，公共畜舍的修建是一个非常迫切的问题。农民们纷纷利用旧材料和义务劳动进行了建设，国家也提供了大批的贷款和建筑器材。目前，这个问题已基本上得到了解决。
    这个州共有十个农业机器站，到去年年底，已拥有五百台拖拉机，今年春天又得到近二百台拖拉机和一批其他的农业机器，春耕的80％，春播的60％是利用机器来完成的。到今年年底，拖拉机的总数将增加到一千台。
    帕普·亚诺什同志非常兴奋地指出，组织起来的农民劳动热情非常高涨，今年春耕、春播工作的成绩，比解放以来任何一年都完成得好，耕作非常精细和及时，每霍尔特土地化学肥料使用量差不多比去年增加了两倍。由于实行了集体经营，播种面积的比例也发生了很大的变化：糖萝卜从去年的两千五百霍尔特增加到四千五百霍尔特，饲料玉米增加了一倍多，预计今年这个州农作物的收成将比去年增加30％到40％。
          胜利的开端
    我们到吉尔茨区访问了拉兹村的农业生产合作社。这个合作社是今年2月26日成立的。全村二百五十二个农户都入了社，共有二千六百霍尔特耕地。
    合作社的社长奈迈特同志年青能干，他过去一直在这个村里劳动，两年前转到区供销合作社工作。2月村里组织合作社时，他又被派回故乡来工作。全体社员一致选这位能劳动、善经营的小伙子担任社长。由于他在工作中表现得非常好，不久前合作社的党组织吸收他入了党。
    农艺师巴乌诺克是由州的国营农场选派到这个社里工作的。这位具有丰富经验的农业专家告诉记者说，他已决定永远在这里工作，决心同大家一起把合作社的生产搞好。
    由社员大会选出来的十三位合作社的常务委员经常开会，并且定期召开全体社员大会，大家共同决定社里的各种重要问题。
    合作社在成立以来的短短几个月中，在公共建设和生产方面已取得了很大的成绩。
    我们在社长和农艺师的陪同下，参观了社里利用旧建筑物扩建的两个畜舍和新建的两个具有现代化设备的畜舍。农民带入社的五百头牛和一百一十头马，都已养在公共畜舍里，并且都长得很肥壮。
    社里还建设了能容纳一千二百头猪的猪圈，购买了六百五十头小猪。
    为了更好的发展畜牧业，目前正在建筑一个很大的、具有各种现代化设备的牛舍，这个工程在最近就可以完成。
    三星期前，社员们用义务劳动建成了一个非常漂亮的文化宫，现在又正在设计添建自来水管。
    国家拨给这个社用于建筑的三十年长期贷款，达三百万福林（匈币），用于其他方面的十五年到二十年中期贷款，共二百万福林。
    附近的矿工曾抽出很多休息时间帮助他们进行建筑。负责经常协助这个合作社的布达佩斯第十区的机器工厂的职工们也在购买原料、修理机器和农村照明等方面给予合作社很大的帮助。区里的国营农场也非常热心地经常向员社介绍生产经验，帮助他们改进耕作方法。
    集体化了的农民们在文化生活方面也有了显著的变化。社里已购买了电影放映机，每周演两三次电影，农民们可以及时地看到国内外的新影片。城市剧院的演员们也常到村里的文化宫来，为农民演出。现在大部分农户都有了无线电收音机，休息时间青年们并经常组织足球、排球和乒乓球比赛及各种文娱活动。
    现在全村的农民都满怀胜利信心在积极地劳动着，他们要争取向国家提供更多的农产品，把社会主义的新农村建设得更美好。正像社里的劳动能手科拉赫对记者说的：“只要大家同心合力，就没有办不好的事。”
          坚定的步伐
    第二天，我们访问了舒迈格区。当我们走进党委办公室时，区党委书记沙尔克吉同志正在同布达佩斯“盖巴尼”制鞋厂的党委书记纳吉·拉约什奈和厂长罗姆哈尼·伊斯特万交谈，研究这个厂如何能更好的协助舒迈格切希村合作社建立党的组织、改进经营和胜利完成夏收任务。
    区委书记告诉记者说，布达佩斯第十区的职工们对这个区合作社的组织和巩固都给予了很大的帮助，工厂的负责人和职工们经常到他们负责协助的合作社进行政治宣传工作，帮助发展党员，建立党的组织，职工们也常抽出时间帮助合作社进行公共建筑，这在政治上对农民是个很大的支持和鼓舞。
    去年这个区只有九个农业生产合作社，最大的社的耕地面积也不超过一千霍尔特。今春全区三十一个村的农民都入了社，村村都成了合作化村。
    我们跟区委书记同志一起参观了这个区的很多农业生产合作社，到处都看到新建起的牛马舍，大片大片的田地里的庄稼都长得非常好。
    当然，合作化运动的迅速发展也带来了一些困难，但由于全党全民的大力支持和农民们的努力，这些困难已得到了克服，民主选举出来的领导，已初步熟悉了自己的工作，合理地组织了劳动，并且在春耕、春播工作中打了第一次胜仗，显示了社会主义集体经营的优越性。
    去年由于主要是分散的个体经营，所以这个区经济作物的任务只完成了50％，今年经济作物比去年增加了三倍多，蔬菜的播种面积增加十倍。任务虽然成倍地增加了，但是社员们干劲很大，信心十足。
    大规模的集体经营给劳动农民带来了发挥创造天才的更广阔的园地。例如，基什格尔伯村的生产能手赫格久什当选了社长，有丰富畜牧经验的农民内梅特担任了畜牧技师。全村的农民在胜利完成春耕任务之后，又在考虑制定远景计划，以便更合理地迅速发展生产。
        优秀的榜样
    最后一天，我们访问了塔波耳察区克瓦戈厄村的农业生产合作社。这个社开始成立于1950年8月。十年来，从小到大，从贫到富，已经取得了很大的成就。
    社长舍拜什切·久拉和很多老社员向我们详细介绍这个生产合作社的发展情况。
    1950年开始建社时，只有二十个社员，都是贫雇农，共有二百四十霍尔特土地，这些土地都是这些农民在土地改革时分到的。
    当时入社只有两匹马，人力物力都非常缺乏，连社的办公室都没有，大家有事就在社员家里商量。但是，合作化的先锋们以共同的智慧和共同的努力，战胜了一切困难，组织了集体劳动。没有任何人畏缩动摇。
    到1958年底为止，合作社在各方面都得到了很大的发展，社员增加到二百零六人，很多中农也入了社，社里的耕地面积达到一千六百霍尔特，公积金从1954年末的八万福林增加到三百四十万福林。
    随着生产的发展，社员每个劳动日的现金收入，由1951年的八福林增加到1958年的五十五福林，除现金外，每户还可以得到足够的实物供给。去年一年的收入达五万福林的社员有六人，收入近四万福林的有三十人，收入三万福林左右的有五十人。往年贫苦的农民今天都过宽裕的生活，每家都有存款，有三十户已盖了新住房。社里并且建筑了两个饭厅，开办了设备完善的托儿所。
    社里并且建筑了办公室、俱乐部和体育场。
    这个村子的农民们并没有忘记他们解放前是怎样生活的。1937年维斯普雷姆州最大的一家地主就占有十万多霍尔特土地，一千霍尔特以上的地主有九十九户，但两万三千个农民却连一寸土地也没有！农民们一年四季都光着脚为地主劳动，住在牛马棚中，享受不到一点人的权利和生活的幸福。因此，当1956年10月反革命暴乱时，这个村的合作社社员和劳动农民坚决地粉碎了敌人的复辟阴谋，捍卫了合作社，捍卫了社会主义制度。
    十年来农民们集体劳动的成就，雄辩地证明了社会主义大规模经营的优越性。今年春天这个村子尚未入社的农民全部都加入了合作社。这个村子的农民还到附近的村子去参加了组织合作社的宣传工作。
    今年这里的春耕任务也完成得非常好，牲畜的数目今年将比去年增加一倍，社员每个劳动日预计可得到六十福林的现金收入。
　   在这个村子里，我们同前来检查工作的州委第一书记帕普·亚诺什一起参观了合作社的农作物、机器、畜舍、养鸡场，以及正在兴建的各种建筑物。帕普·亚诺什同志告诉记者说，这个社最大的特点是自力更生，社员从来不依靠和等待国家的帮助，他们同心合力，用自己的双手克服了一切困难，建设着新生活，为国家一年比一年更多地增产农产品。
