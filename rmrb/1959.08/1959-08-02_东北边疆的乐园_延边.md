    Northeast Frontier Paradise – Yanbian
    Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province is a very beautiful and rich place, praised as "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall" and a "paradise on the frontier."
    Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southeastern part of Jilin Province, bordering the Soviet Union's coastal region to the east and facing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea across the Tumen River to the south. The total length of the border is more than 1,000 li. It covers a total area of 41,500 square kilometers. It currently governs six counties: Yanji, Helong, Hunchun, Wangqing, Antu, Dunhua, and the city of Yanji. The prefecture has a total population of 1,019,000 people of various ethnic groups, mainly Korean, accounting for 56.9% of the total population (Han Chinese account for 41.3%, Manchus 1.48%, and the rest are Hui, Mongol, Zhuang, Yi, etc.). It is also the main residential area for Koreans in China.
    The prefecture is mostly hilly, with the saying "eight mountains, one water, and one field." However, rivers are densely distributed, and the vast land is surrounded by the mountains of Changbai Mountain, nourished by the Burhatong River, Hailan River, and Tumen River, with abundant products. Forests are the prefecture's greatest natural wealth, covering about 80% of the prefecture's land. The accumulation of coniferous and broad-leaved trees such as Korean pine, larch, Amur cork tree, and ash reaches more than 300 million cubic meters. People say that there are "three treasures" in Guandong, but in fact, the treasures on the mountains of Yanbian are far more than three: ginseng, sable fur, deer antler, tiger bone, sable, bear paw, gray squirrel, and tree ears, etc., truly numerous and endless. Although the climate in the prefecture is cold, with short summers and long winters, and the frost-free period is generally only 120 to 140 days, the yields of millet, soybeans, flue-cured tobacco, and fruits are abundant because the people of all ethnic groups actively overcome the difficulties brought about by unfavorable climatic conditions. In particular, Korean farmers are good at building water conservancy projects, transforming nature, and reclaiming paddy fields, turning the entire region into the "hometown of northern rice." Exploration has revealed that there are also many underground mineral deposits of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and oil shale.
    The development of the Yanbian area has a history of one hundred years. Since the second half of the 19th century, Koreans and people of all ethnic groups have cultivated land and settled here, developing production and gradually building their homes. However, due to the long-term rule of the exploiting classes, especially the exploitation and plunder by Japanese imperialism after the "September 18th Incident," they could only live increasingly impoverished lives for generations. Only after the liberation in September 1945, under the leadership of the Party, did the people of all ethnic groups realize the democratic revolution and carry out the socialist revolution; since 1952, regional autonomy has been implemented, and in 1958, the people's commune was realized, gradually liberating the productive forces, stimulating the political enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, and effectively developing various resources, accelerating the development of various socialist construction undertakings.
    In the past, Yanbian's local industry, apart from a few small handicraft factories such as wineries and iron factories, had no decent industrial and mining enterprises. After liberation, thanks to the leadership and support of the Party and the investment of the People's Government, many modern factories and mines were newly built. Shanghai and other brotherly cities also provided strong technical assistance, quickly changing the backward face of the prefecture's industry. At present, the prefecture has 263 state-owned and prefecture, city, and county-run iron and steel, electromechanical, coal, agricultural tool, paper-making, fertilizer, and forest factories and mining enterprises, forming an industrial network that produces 103 kinds of industrial products. Many products can basically meet the needs of local industrial and agricultural production and the lives of people of all ethnic groups. A large amount of high-quality timber, pulp, etc., is continuously transported out to support construction in other areas. During the Second Five-Year Plan, it will further develop light and heavy industries such as iron and steel, electromechanical, coal, petroleum, cement, and daily necessities.
    With the development of industry, transportation and postal and telecommunications in the prefecture have also developed accordingly. Now all towns in the prefecture are connected by trains, all townships and communities are connected by cars, and all townships, communities, management areas, and production teams are connected by telephone. Transportation and postal and telecommunications can be said to be accessible in all directions.
    In agricultural production, similarly, rapid development has been achieved. In particular, the realization of communization last year has opened up a broader path for greater agricultural development this year. Since the beginning of this year, all parts of the prefecture have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production in light of their actual conditions, and in accordance with regional characteristics, have comprehensively arranged agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries to strive for an all-round harvest.
    The development of cultural and educational undertakings is also amazing. Before liberation, the ethnic languages and characters of Yanbian were long discriminated against and prohibited by the reactionary ruling class. Now, all ethnic groups not only have their own national characters, but have also basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy, primary education has been popularized, and secondary education has also been basically popularized. In terms of higher education, since the establishment of the Yanbian University, a minority nationality university, in 1949, it has increased to three universities last year, and the number of college students has increased by 2.7 times compared with 1949. Spare-time education for workers and peasants has also been widely developed. At present, the number of people participating in various forms of learning every day in the prefecture accounts for 40% of the total population. In terms of culture, the Korean people have more fully developed their talent for singing and dancing. From the prefecture and counties to the communes, singing and dancing activities are very common, and there is music everywhere.
    In order to create a happier tomorrow, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are full of confidence and are working hard to realize the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. (Jin Changfan) (Attached photo)

    东北边疆的乐园——延边
    吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州，是一个非常美丽而富饶的地方，人们称赞它是“塞外江南”，是“边疆的乐园”。
    延边朝鲜族自治州位于吉林省东南部，东与苏联沿海边区接壤，南与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国隔图们江相望，国境线全长达一千多华里。总面积是四万一千五百多平方公里。现辖延吉、和龙、珲春、汪清、安图、敦化六个县和延吉市。全州共有各族人民一百零一万九千人，以朝鲜族为主，占总人数的56.9％（汉族占41.3％，满族1.48％，其余为回、蒙古、僮、彝等）。它也是我国境内朝鲜族人民的主要居住地区。
    州内多丘陵，向有“八山一水一田”的说法。但是河流密布，广大土地在长白山的群山环抱中，受着布尔哈通河、海兰河、图们江的滋润，物产丰富。森林是全州最大的自然财富。它覆盖着全州80％左右的土地，红松、落叶松、黄波罗、水曲柳等针阔叶林木蓄积量达三亿多立方米。人们传说关东有“三宝”，其实，延边山上的珍产何止三件：人参、貂皮、鹿茸、虎骨、元皮、熊掌、灰鼠和木耳等，真是名目繁多，数量无穷。州内的气候虽然寒冷，夏短冬长，无霜期一般只有一百二十天到一百四十天，但是，由于各族人民积极克服不利的气候条件所带来的困难，所以，谷子、大豆、烤烟和水果等的产量都很丰富。特别是由于朝鲜族农民善于兴修水利，改造自然，垦辟水田，把整个地区建成了“北方水稻之乡”。经勘探查明，地下的金、银、铜、铁、铅和油母页等矿藏也很多。
    延边地区的开发已有一百年的历史。从十九世纪下半叶起，朝鲜族和各族人民就在这里垦地安家，发展生产，逐步建设自己的家园。但是，由于剥削阶级的长期统治，特别是“九一八”事变以后日本帝国主义的榨取掠夺，他们世代只能过着日益贫困的生活。只有在1945年9月解放后，各族人民在党的领导下，实现了民主革命，进行社会主义革命；从1952年以来实行了区域自治，1958年实现了人民公社化，逐步解放了生产力，激发了各族人民的政治热情，就有效地开发各种资源，加速各项社会主义建设事业的发展。
    过去，延边的地方工业，除了几个造酒厂、铁工厂之类的小手工业工厂外，没有什么像样的工矿企业。解放后，由于党的领导和扶植，人民政府的投资，新建了许多现代化的工厂和矿山。上海等兄弟城市又大力予以技术援助，很快的就改变了全州工业落后的面貌。目前，全州已有国营和州、市、县营钢铁、机电、煤炭、农具、造纸、化肥、森林等厂矿企业二百六十三个，形成了工业网，生产各种工业产品达一百零三种。许多产品已能基本满足当地工农业生产和各族人民生活的需要。大量优质木材、纸浆等，源源运出支援外地建设。在第二个五年计划期间，它将进一步发展钢铁、机电、煤炭、石油、水泥、日用品等轻重工业。
    随着工业的发展，州内交通、邮电也有了相应的发展。现在全州各城镇都通了火车，各乡、社都通了汽车，各乡、社、管理区、生产队，都通上电话。交通、邮电可说是四通八达。
    在农业生产方面，同样获得了迅速地发展。特别是去年实现了公社化，为今年农业更大发展打开了更为广阔的道路。今年以来，全州各地结合实际情况，认真贯彻农业生产的“八字宪法”，并按照地区特点，全面地安排了农林牧副渔五业，争取全面丰收。
    文化教育事业的发展也是惊人的。解放前，延边的民族语言和文字，长期被反动统治阶级所歧视，并且禁止使用。现在各民族不但有本民族的文字，而且已基本上完成了扫盲任务，小学教育普及了，中学教育也基本上普及。在高等教育方面，继在1949年建立起少数民族大学——延边大学以来，去年又增加到三所大学，大学生比1949年增加了二点七倍。工农业余教育也有了普遍的发展。现在，全州每天参加各种形式学习的人数，占总人口的40％。在文化方面，朝鲜族更充分发扬了他们能歌善舞的天才，从州、县到公社，歌舞活动非常普遍，到处弦歌。
    为了创造更幸福的明天，全州各族人民正满怀信心，为提前实现第二个五年计划而努力。　（金昌范）（附图片）
