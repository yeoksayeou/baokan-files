How is Paint Made?

The name "paint" is familiar to everyone, but if someone asks: what exactly is paint made of? Not everyone can answer that. Paint is made from raw materials such as tung oil, linseed oil, rosin, synthetic resin, and pigments. The method of manufacturing paint was initially introduced from foreign countries, so people called it "foreign paint," which is fundamentally different from the raw lacquer (also called Chinese lacquer or lacquer) that has been used in China for a long time. Chinese lacquer or raw lacquer is made from the sap of lacquer trees after processing procedures such as "water removal." The Chinese people knew how to use raw lacquer to decorate furniture and utensils more than 4,000 years ago. Until recently, many handicraft products and beautiful handicrafts (such as Fujian carved lacquer and lacquerware) were made of raw lacquer. What I want to introduce here is not Chinese lacquer, but the industrially processed paint, that is, the so-called "foreign paint."

The raw materials required for manufacturing paint can be roughly divided into: oils, resins (natural or synthetic), solvents, driers, plasticizers, and pigments. Oils generally use vegetable oils; vegetable oils can be divided into three types: drying, semi-drying, and non-drying. Drying or semi-drying vegetable oils include: tung oil, linseed oil, elaeostearin oil, perilla oil, soybean oil, etc. When oil is applied to the surface of an object, it will dry and form a thin film after a considerable period of time. The manufacture of paint utilizes this characteristic. Non-drying oils, however, are not easy to form a film and can only be used as plasticizers to help the paint film obtain flexible properties. Castor oil is a representative of this type of non-drying oil.

Resins are divided into natural resins and artificial resins (i.e., synthetic resins). Rosin, copal, and dammar gum are all natural resins; phenolic resins, alkyd resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, and many resins made by organic synthetic chemical methods are all artificial resins.

Solvents are used to dissolve materials such as oils and resins. With solvents, the viscosity of the paint can be adjusted to make the paint easy to apply. Solvents can be some organic compounds, such as: acetone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethanol, butanol, benzene, toluene, xylene, turpentine, mineral spirits, and solvent oil, etc. Turpentine, mineral spirits, and xylene are mostly used as solvents for manufacturing paints.

Driers are metal soaps of lead, cobalt, and manganese, which can promote faster drying of the paint.

In order to obtain various colored paints, various pigments are used, such as: carbon black, titanium white, zinc oxide, lead chrome yellow, chrome green, iron blue, etc. Most of these pigments are inorganic compounds.

When manufacturing paint, oils and resins are generally mixed according to a formula and then boiled. During this preparation and processing, the raw materials undergo chemical changes, resulting in many advantages: such as accelerated drying, bright paint film, enhanced physical properties of the paint film, etc., and at the same time, the viscosity also increases. In order to reduce the viscosity and make the paint easy to apply, solvents are often added after boiling. The product obtained at this time is a clear and transparent viscous solution (like the honey we often see); this solution is called varnish or vehicle, which is a semi-finished product. Adding some driers to the varnish (so that the varnish can dry faster after application) becomes clear varnish. The paint film formed by the clear varnish is basically clear and transparent, without color (sometimes slightly yellow). Adding pigments to the clear varnish results in various colored paints, commonly known as colored paints.

The paint varieties appearing on the market now are diverse. Some are named after the main components, such as: clear varnish made with phenolic resin as raw material is called phenolic clear varnish; clear varnish made with alkyd resin is called alkyd clear varnish, and its colored paint is called alkyd enamel. The same applies to other products such as ester gum paint, epoxy resin paint, and silicone paint. Some are named after their uses, which is more convenient for users to choose paints, such as: aviation paint, railway bridge paint, ship paint, antifouling paint, electrical insulating paint, primer (for priming), etc.

There is also a type of paint called lacquer, which does not use vegetable oil as the main raw material. Lacquer is made by dissolving nitrocellulose in organic solvents, and is also called nitrocellulose lacquer.

The quality of paint depends on the quality of the paint itself and the quality of the project. If the construction method is improper, even very good paint cannot fully exert its protective effect.

    油漆是怎样制造的？
    油漆这个名字，早为大家所熟悉，但是如果有人问：油漆究竟是用什么做成的？那就不是每个人都能回答得出来的。油漆是用桐油、亚麻仁油、松香、合成树脂、颜料等原料配制而成的。制造油漆的方法，起初是由国外传入的，所以人们把它叫成“洋漆”，它和我国沿用已久的生漆（大漆，也叫中国漆），根本不同。中国漆或生漆，是用漆树的汁，经过“去水”等加工手续而制成的。我国人民在四千多年前，就已经知道用生漆涂饰家具器皿了，直到最近还有很多手工业制品和美丽的手工艺品（如福建雕漆和漆器），是用生漆制成的。这里要介绍的不是中国漆，而是想谈谈通过工业加工而制成的油漆，也就是所谓“洋漆”。
    制造油漆需用的原材料，大体可划分为：油脂、树脂（天然的或合成的）、溶剂、催干剂、增韧剂和颜料等几大类。油脂，一般都采用植物油；植物油又可分为干性、半干性和不干性三种。干性油或半干性植物油包括：桐油、亚麻仁油、梓油、苏子油、豆油等等，把油涂在物体表面，过了相当时候，会干燥而结成一张薄膜，制造油漆，就是利用这个特性。不干性油却不大容易结膜，只能作为增韧剂，帮助油漆的漆膜获得柔韧的性能。蓖麻油就是这种不干性油的代表。
    树脂，有天然树脂和人造树脂（即合成树脂）之分。松香、珂?、达玛胶都是天然树脂；酚醛树脂、醇酸树脂、尿醛树脂以及很多种用有机合成的化学方法制成的树脂，都是人造树脂。
    溶剂是用来溶解油脂、树脂等材料的，有了溶剂，可以调节油漆的粘度，使油漆便于涂刷。可以作为溶剂的，都是一些有机化合物，像：丙酮、醋酸乙酯、醋酸丁酯、乙醇、丁醇、苯、甲苯、二甲苯、松节油、松香水和溶剂油等等。制造油漆使用的溶剂，以松节油、松香水和二甲苯居多。
    催干剂，是一种铅、钴、锰的金属皂，它在油漆里能催促油漆干燥得更快。
    为了能够得到各种彩色的油漆，便采用了各种颜料，如：碳黑、钛白、氧化锌、铅铬黄、铬绿、铁兰等，这些颜料，大部分是无机化合物。
    制造油漆的时候，一般是将油脂、树脂等按照配方配合，然后加以熬炼。在这制配加工过程中，原料起了化学变化，获得了很多的优点：如干燥加快、漆膜光亮、漆膜的物理性能增强等等，同时粘度也增高了。为了降低粘度，使油漆便于涂刷，在熬炼之后，往往加入溶剂。这时制得的东西，是一种清澈透明的粘稠溶液（和我们常见的蜂蜜一样）；这种溶液，叫作漆料或基料，这是一种半制品。在漆料中加入一些催干剂（使漆料在涂刷以后能够较快地干燥），就成为清漆。清漆结成的漆膜，基本上清澈透底，不带颜色（有时稍有黄色）。清漆中加入颜料，就成为各种彩色的油漆，通常称之谓色漆。
    现在市场上出现的油漆品种五花八门，有的是以组成的主要成分来命名的，如：用酚醛树脂为原料制成的清漆，叫做酚醛清漆；以醇酸树脂制成的清漆，叫做醇酸清漆，它的色漆，叫做醇酸磁漆。其他如酯胶漆、环氧树脂漆、有机硅漆也是同样的道理。也有以用途命名的，这样对用户选用油漆时比较方便，如：航空用漆、铁道桥梁用漆、船舶用漆、船底漆、电气绝缘漆、头道底子漆（打底用）等等。
    油漆里还有一个品种，叫做喷漆，它不是拿植物油作为主要原料的。喷漆是用硝化纤维素溶解在有机溶剂中而制得的，它又叫硝基漆。
    油漆的好坏，一方面取决于油漆本身的质量，另一方面也看工程质量好坏而定。施工方法不得当，很好的油漆，也不能充分发挥它的防护作用。
