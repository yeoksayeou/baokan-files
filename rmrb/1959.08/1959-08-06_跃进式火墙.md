    Great Leap Forward Fire Wall
    The coal conservation group of the Harbin Coal Construction Company has successfully developed a fast-heating, heat-preserving, and coal-saving Great Leap Forward fire wall.
    This fire wall is 266 centimeters long, 30 centimeters wide, and 198 centimeters high, with five fire holes (old fire walls were hollow and had no fire holes). The stove is located on the front of the fire wall. There are fire outlets on the left and right sides of the stove (old fire walls only had one fire outlet), facing the fire holes on both sides. Once the stove is lit, the smoke and fire go from the fire outlets on both sides along the fire holes, concentrating from both sides to the middle. In about an hour, every corner of the fire wall can be heated. According to scientific appraisal, burning the fire three times a day (once every eight hours), the average hourly heat dissipation can reach 4,000 kilocalories, the indoor temperature can be maintained above 15 degrees Celsius, and the heating area can reach 35 square meters.
    More than 1,800 of these fire walls have already been promoted in Harbin. The average daily coal consumption per fire wall has been reduced from 51 jin to 36 jin. (Picture attached)

    跃进式火墙
    哈尔滨市煤建公司节约用煤小组研究成功一种快热、保温、省煤的跃进式火墙。
    这种火墙长二百六十六厘米，宽三十厘米，高一百九十八厘米，有五个火洞（旧火墙中空，不分火洞）。火炉设在火墙的正面。火炉左右两边设有出火口（旧火墙只有一个出火口），对着两边火洞。一烧火炉，烟火就从两边出火口顺着火洞由两面向中间集中。一小时左右，就能暖热火墙的每个角落。根据科学鉴定，每昼夜烧三次火（八小时一次），平均每小时散热量可达四千仟卡，室内温度可保持十五度以上，取暖面积达三十五平方米。
    这种火墙已经在哈尔滨市推广了一千八百多个。每个火墙每天平均耗煤量，已由五十一斤降低到三十六斤。（附图片）
