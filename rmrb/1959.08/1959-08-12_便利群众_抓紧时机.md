Editorial Note

　　Facilitating the Masses, Seizing the Opportunity

    In the current activities of purchasing local and special products, the commercial departments of Chongqing have a very clear guiding ideology: facilitating sales for the masses, expanding purchasing points, increasing mobile purchasing personnel, organizing material exchange fairs, introducing the varieties and prices of local and special products, supplying tools, and training technical personnel... It can be said that they have tried every possible way and put in a lot of effort.

    In purchasing local and special products, two things are most important: one is to seize the opportunity, and the other is to facilitate the masses. The production and harvesting of many local and special products are seasonal; if the opportunity for mass marketing is missed, local and special products are prone to being dispersed and lost, and some may even rot and deteriorate. It becomes very difficult to purchase them at that time, and it causes losses to the producers. Therefore, seizing the opportunity is very important.

    However, it is not enough to just seize the opportunity. No matter how skillfully and tightly the opportunity is seized, if the masses need to cross mountains and rivers or encounter many other troubles to sell a little local and special product, then the enthusiasm for selling will be reduced. Therefore, facilitating the masses is as important as seizing the opportunity.

    Because the commercial departments of Chongqing have taken many measures to facilitate the masses, the work of purchasing local and special products has already achieved initial success. If they continue to do so in this spirit in the future, the purchasing results will inevitably expand further. This inference is unlikely to be doubted by anyone.

### 便利群众　抓紧时机

　　便利群众　抓紧时机
    重庆商业部门在当前收购土特产品的活动中，看得很清楚的一个指导思想是：便利群众出售，扩大收购点，增加流动收购人员，组织物资交流会，介绍土特产品的品种、价格，供应工具，培训技术人员……可算得多方设法，大费心思。
    收购土特产品，有两件事最为要紧，一是抓紧时机，一是便利群众。许多土特产品的生产和收获，都有季节性；错过大量上市的时机，土特产品就易于分散流失，有的甚至要腐损变质，这时再去收购，就困难重重，而且给生产者造成了损失。所以说，抓时机很重要。
    不过，光抓时机还不够。时机抓得再巧再紧，如果群众出售一点土特产品，需要翻山涉水，或者遇到其他很多麻烦，那末出售的积极性就会降低。所以，便利群众和抓时机同等重要。
    重庆商业部门由于采取了许多便利群众的措施，收购土特产品的工作已经初获成绩。今后如果继续本着这种精神去做，收购成绩必然还会扩大。这一推断，大概是不会有人怀疑的。
