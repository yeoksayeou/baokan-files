Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 10th: The Iraqi newspaper "Al-Thawra" published an editorial on the 9th, wantonly attacking the communist parties of various countries. It said, "Communists everywhere are taking anarchistic actions in their countries, preventing these countries from realizing all aspects of the democracy they have achieved."

The newspaper slandered the Communist Party of India as standing with the imperialists.

The newspaper also said, "When imperialist or pro-imperialist governments struggle against communism, it benefits imperialism," but "when a liberated country opposes communism," it "cannot be said that this only benefits imperialism."

This newspaper, along with some other newspapers, also attacked the various people's organizations in Iraq. This newspaper published an editorial on the 2nd saying that the leadership of "all people's organizations" in Iraq "is controlled by those anarchists," and that "the people's organizations have broken the law." The editorial openly proposed the immediate removal of the leaders of the various people's organizations from their posts.

The "Al-Hurriyah" newspaper also promoted the dissolution of the leadership of trade unions and people's organizations in its editorial on the 9th. It attacked these organizations, saying that "anarchists" impose their principles and narrow partisan tendencies on others. The Iraqi National Democratic Party's organ, "Al-Shaab," attacked trade union leaders in its editorial on the 9th for indulging their members in partisan struggles, calling on them to relinquish their positions and hold new elections.

　　伊拉克“革命报”攻击各国共产党
    新华社10日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克“革命报”9日发表社论，放肆攻击各国共产党。它说，“每一个地方的共产党人都在他们的国家采取无政府主义行动，阻止这些国家实现它们已经取得的民主的各方面”。
    这家报纸诬蔑印度共产党同帝国主义者站在一边。
    这家报纸还说什么，“当帝国主义或亲帝国主义政府对共产主义进行斗争的时候，这是有利于帝国主义的”，但是“当一个获得解放的国家反对共产主义”时，就“不能说这只有利于帝国主义”。
    这家报纸还同其他一些报纸一起攻击伊拉克的各人民团体。这家报纸在2日发表社论说，伊拉克的“所有人民团体的领导都被控制在那些无政府主义者手中”，“人民团体都犯了法。”社论公开提出要立即解除各人民团体领导人的职务。
    “自由报”在9日的社论中也宣扬要解散工会和人民团体的领导机构。它攻击这些机构说“无政府主义分子”把他们的原则和狭隘党派倾向强加于人。伊拉克国家民主党机关报“国民报”9日的社论攻击工会领导人纵容他们的成员卷入党派斗争，要他们放弃他们的职位，重新选举。
