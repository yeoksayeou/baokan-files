Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 10th: Vientiane Dispatch: According to the "Lao Patriotic News" on August 7th, the people in the northern Luang Prabang Province of Laos have also taken up arms to oppose the increasingly intensified terror actions of the Phoui Sananikone government.

According to reports, in the four days leading up to August 5th, the Lao Royal Government dispatched motorized troops to areas such as Bonchouan, Phaxuong, and Keo-Oua. These newly arrived troops, in coordination with the Royal troops stationed at local strongholds, surrounded local villages, strafed residents with machine guns, and destroyed crops. Local people and people's armed forces, in self-defense, returned fire and drove away the Royal Army in many places. On August 2nd, the Royal Army conducting a "sweep" in Phieng Ry was met with fierce resistance from local people and people's armed forces. Ten Royal Army soldiers were killed, some were injured, and the rest were forced to retreat.

The newspaper said that most of the Royal Army soldiers were weary of war and unwilling to slaughter the common people.

Difficulties in food supply due to bad weather have also lowered the morale of the Royal Army. During the fighting, more than seventy officers and soldiers of the Royal Army have deserted into the jungle.

According to reports, the Royal Army is still continuing its "sweep," but is encountering increasing difficulties. Residents in northern Luang Prabang are continuing their self-defense battles.

　　老挝当局变本加厉扩大内战
　　琅勃拉邦省人民迎头回击
    新华社河内10日电　万象消息：据“老挝爱国报”8月7日报道，老挝琅勃拉邦省北部的人民也已经拿起武器，来反对培·萨纳尼空政府的变本加厉的恐怖行动。
    据报道，在到8月5日为止的四天中，老挝王国政府派遣摩托化部队开往本川、婆生和核午等地。这批新开到的部队同驻在当地据点的王国部队配合，包围当地村庄，用机关枪向居民扫射，并且毁坏作物。当地人民和人民武装力量为了自卫，开火回击，并且在许多地方赶跑了王国军队。8月2日，在飞锐进行“扫荡”的王国军队遭到当地人民和人民武装力量的猛烈反击。王国军队有十人被击毙，一些人受伤，其余的被迫撤退。
    这家报纸说，大部分王国军队都有厌战情绪，不愿残杀老百姓。
    由于天气恶劣而造成的食品供应困难，也使王国军队的士气下降在作战中，已经有七十多名王国军队的官兵逃入丛林。
    据报道，目前，王国军队还在继续进行“扫荡”，但是遭到日益增多的困难。琅勃拉邦北部居民正在继续进行自卫战斗。
