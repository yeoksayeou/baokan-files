Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 18th. The prelude to the battle to harvest the more than 39.5 million mu of mid-season rice in Sichuan Province has begun, and farmers everywhere are harvesting busily. Now, except for the western Sichuan Plain, where the season is slightly later, on the golden fields of the basin, the labor army is fighting to harvest. It is expected that within the next week, the mid-season rice harvest in various places will successively enter its peak.

This year's mid-season rice harvest season was obtained through constant struggle against drought disasters, and therefore farmers in various places particularly cherish the fruits of victory that are about to be obtained. Careful harvesting and threshing, and timely harvesting have become resounding slogans in this year's autumn harvest. The broad masses of farmers are fully motivated to make up for the losses caused by this year's drought with practical actions of good harvesting, good threshing, good drying, and good storage. Yibin, Luzhou, Fuling and other regions held various meetings before the harvest to arrange labor, tools, etc. Many commune management areas and teams have also specifically implemented the harvest tasks based on the maturity of the mid-season rice, striving to harvest one piece as it ripens. In the intense fight against drought, Fuling County adopted a two-pronged approach in order to harvest mid-season rice in a timely manner, fighting drought in the early morning and evening and harvesting during the day. In order to do a good job in careful harvesting and threshing and returning every grain to the granary, various places, from the regions and counties to the communes and management areas, generally held special meetings to mobilize the masses to discuss and summarize the experience of early rice harvesting, offer suggestions and ideas, and propose specific methods. The Yibin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the original experience of the masses and proposed that the harvest should tightly grasp five key points, namely harvesting, threshing, transportation, drying, and storage, assigning personnel to each key process to strive to return every grain to the granary. Various places also used small exhibitions, on-site meetings, etc. to conduct memory comparisons, specific accounting, educate the masses to cherish food, and impart various harvesting and threshing techniques.

In the rush to harvest, various places also launched high-efficiency, high-quality movements and widely promoted improved tools to improve efficiency and speed up the harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 17th. In the vast fields of Hunan Province, from the shores of Dongting Lake to the foothills of the Wuling Mountains, 17 million mu of mid-season rice has begun to be harvested. In the Changde area on the shores of Dongting Lake, more than 5 million laborers have been put into the rush to harvest mid-season rice.

Various places have widely used the experience of rushing to harvest early rice, rationally arranged labor, promoted advanced tools, and launched a competition for high efficiency and high quality, which has accelerated the speed of mid-season rice harvesting. The people's communes in Leiyang County promoted the continuous operation method of "harvesting, threshing, transporting, and drying at the same time." Five people per threshing drum, reasonably matched according to physical strength, technical level, made the rush harvest work fast and well. ChengGuan commune implemented the "contracting of large plots to the threshing drum, and small plots to individuals," and carried out evaluation competitions between drums and between people, which greatly improved work efficiency. The fast rice harvesting machine and rice threshing machine that were effective in the early rice harvest have been widely promoted in various places. The counties of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have trained more than 800 skilled operators of fast rice harvesters and newly produced more than 3,600 fast rice harvesters. When LianTang brigade of Tanzi Mountain People's Commune in Hengnan County was rushing to harvest mid-season rice, new-style tools showed their power. This brigade promoted more than 100 fast rice harvesters and a batch of rice threshing machines, which increased work efficiency by two to three times.

Hunan mid-season rice has been suffering from drought recently, and it is easy to lose grain. Recently, it has been sunny and rainy again, and it is easy to lodging and sprout. In response to this characteristic, various places have researched many new harvesting methods. The production teams of Qifengdu Commune in Chen County organized cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to inspect the fields, classify them, arrange the order of harvesting according to the order of maturity, gently cut and release the mid-season rice that has lodged; they cut cleanly and neatly; when threshing, they gently lift and heavily beat; when drying the grain, they first dry the wet grain, then dry the dry grain, and do thin drying and frequent turning of the wet grain. In this way, none of the more than 1,600 mu of lodged mid-season rice in the entire commune was damaged.

　　不断战胜旱涝灾害威胁　千万农民喜收胜利果实
　　四川湖南开镰收中稻
　　各地注意研究细收细打方法，保证做到颗粒还家
    本报成都18日电　四川省三千九百五十多万亩中稻的抢收大战序幕已经揭开，各地农民正在紧张地收割。现在，除季节稍迟的川西平原外，盆地内金黄的田野上，劳动大军正在奋战抢收。预计最近一周之内，各地中稻收割将陆续进入高潮。
    今年中稻收获季节，是在和干旱灾害不断斗争中得来的，因而各地农民特别珍惜即将到手的胜利果实。精打细收、适时收割，已成为各地今年秋收中的响亮口号。广大农民正鼓足干劲，以割好、打好、晒好、藏好的实际行动，来弥补今年干旱造成的损失。宜宾、泸州、涪陵等专区，在收获前召开了各种会议，对劳力、工具等作了安排。许多公社管理区、队，还根据中稻成熟情况，将收获任务具体落实，争取作到黄一块、收一块。涪陵县在紧张抗旱斗争中，为了适时收割中稻，早晚抗旱，白天收割，双管齐下。为了作好精打细收，颗粒归仓，各地从专区、县直到公社、管理区，一般都专门召开会议，发动群众讨论、总结早稻收割的经验，献策献计，提出具体办法。中共宜宾地委总结了群众原有的经验，提出收获中要紧紧抓住五关，即收割、打谷、运输、翻晒、收藏五个关键，分兵把口，力争颗粒归仓。各地还通过小型展览会、现场会等，进行回忆对比，具体算帐，教育群众爱惜粮食，传授各种收打技术。
    各地在抢收中，还开展了高工效、高质量运动，和大量推广改良工具，提高工效和加快收割进度。
    新华社长沙17日电　从洞庭湖滨到五岭山麓的湖南省广阔田野里，一千七百万亩中稻已开始收割。洞庭湖滨的常德专区，投入抢收中稻的劳动力达五百多万人。
    各地普遍运用抢收早稻的经验，合理安排劳力，推广先进工具，开展高工效、高质量的竞赛运动，加快了中稻收割速度。耒阳县各人民公社推广了“边割、边打、边运，边晒”的流水作业法，五人一张桶、按体力强弱，技术高低，合理搭配，使抢收工作做得又快又好。城关公社实行了大丘包到桶，小丘包到人，开展桶与桶、人与人的评比竞赛，大大提高了工效。早稻收割中行之有效的快速割禾器和打稻机，在各地得到了广泛推广。湘西土家族苗族自治州各县曾训练培养了八百多名操作快速割禾器的能手，新制了快速割禾器三千六百多部。衡南县谭子山人民公社莲塘大队在抢收中稻的时候，新式工具大显神通，这个大队推广了一百多部快速割禾器和一批打稻机，工效提高两倍到三倍。
    湖南中稻由于不久前受了旱，很容易掉粒，近日又乍晴乍雨，很容易倒伏发芽。针对这个特点，各地都研究出了许多新的收打方法。郴县栖凤渡公社各生产队，组织干部、老农、技术员临田查看，分类排队，按照成熟先后，安排收割的次序，对已经倒伏的中稻，轻割轻放，割净割齐；打禾时轻举重打；晒谷时先晒湿谷，后晒干谷，对湿谷做到薄晒勤翻。这样，全社一千六百多亩倒伏的中稻都没有受到损失。
