Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, August 20th: The results of the first House of Representatives election in the Federation of Malaya, held on the 19th, were announced today.

73.3% of the two million voters participated in the first general election since the independence of the Federation of Malaya. Of the total 104 seats, the ruling Alliance Party (MCA-UMNO-MIC) won 73 seats, although it only received 51.4% of the total votes. The Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PAS) won 13 seats; the Socialist Front of Malaya won 8 seats; the People's Progressive Party won 4 seats; independents won 3 seats; the Malayan Party and the Negara Party each won 1 seat. In addition, one seat requires a by-election because one of the opposition candidates was deemed unqualified.

The MCA-UMNO-MIC Alliance government imposed many restrictions and arrests on the opposition parties on the eve of the vote. However, the proportion of seats it won was significantly lower than in the 1955 Legislative Council election.

It was announced today that the MCA-UMNO-MIC Alliance will re-form the cabinet tomorrow. Sources revealed that Alliance Chairman Rahman will once again serve as Prime Minister.

    马来亚首次大选揭晓
    执政党靠了压制反对党获得多数议席
    据新华社20日讯　吉隆坡消息：19日举行的马来亚联合邦第一届下议院选举今天已经揭晓。
    二百万选民中有73.3％参加了马来亚联合邦独立后的第一次大选。在全部一百零四席中，执政的马华印联盟得七十三席，虽然它只得到全部选票的51.4％。泛马来亚伊斯兰党得十三席；马来亚人民社会主义阵线八席；人民进步党四席；独立人士三席；马来亚党和国家党各得一席。另外还有一席因为有一个反对党的候选人被认为不合格需要补选。
    马华印联盟政府在投票前夕对反对党进行了许多限制和逮捕，但是，它所得的议席的比例比1955年的立法议会选举大为降低。
    据今天宣布，马华印联盟将在明天重新组阁。消息透露，联盟主席拉赫曼将再次出任总理。
