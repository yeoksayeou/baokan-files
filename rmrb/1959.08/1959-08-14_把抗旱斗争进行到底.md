　　Carry the Struggle Against Drought Through to the End
    A great mass struggle against drought, under the leadership of the Party, has been victoriously launched. More than 60 million people across the country have thrown themselves into the arduous struggle against drought with earth-shaking spirit. In Henan Province, more than 20 million people and cadres are involved in the fight against drought every day. Under the slogans of "The whole Party is mobilized, all the people are on the march" and "Fight the drought to the end, ensure a good harvest without rain," they are fighting day and night to seize grain from the sky. After more than half a month of struggle, more than 60 million mu of drought-stricken land have been irrigated once, twice, or three times. The people of Hubei Province, with their greatest efforts, have gone all out and launched a high tide of drought resistance. The province has rescued more than 16 million mu of crops. Shandong, Hunan, Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other provinces also have millions of drought-fighting troops, persevering in the fight against drought. The rescued crops generally grow well. More than 9 million mu of mid-season rice in Hubei has large, full ears and a good harvest is in sight. This year's drought is serious, but the tested Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, will give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and will certainly be able to overcome the threat of drought and ensure a good harvest.
    At present, the drought is still developing, and we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have made, and we must not relax or be paralyzed. We should clearly realize that to overcome the drought, we still need to carry out arduous work. The current weather is dry and hot, and drought winds are attacking frequently. Water evaporates quickly. The crops that have not yet been irrigated and rescued are rapidly deepening in drought, and the crops that have been rescued will quickly dehydrate or lose moisture, and may be affected by drought again. According to weather forecasts, most drought-stricken areas will continue to lack rain in the near future, and the drought will continue to develop. Faced with this situation, Party and government leaders and the broad masses in drought-stricken areas must further boost their energy, oppose complacency, continue to overcome all difficulties, and fight the drought to the end.
    In order to concentrate efforts on drought resistance, work that can be stopped or postponed in rural areas should be stopped or postponed so as to concentrate all efforts on drought rescue. Areas where drought has just emerged should seize the opportunity to mobilize as soon as possible and strive to quickly extinguish the drought. Areas where drought may occur should also be vigilant, strengthen precautions, and fight drought where there is drought, and prevent drought where there is no drought. Rice-producing areas affected by drought must persist in drought resistance and prevention until the harvest of mid-season and late-season rice. Miscellaneous grain and wheat producing areas affected by drought must not only persist until the autumn crop harvest, but also ensure the timely completion of autumn plowing and planting.
    To achieve a complete victory in the fight against drought, a series of specific problems must be properly resolved. At present, one of the most important issues in drought prevention and resistance is to make full use of water sources, save water, and vigorously open up water sources in areas with insufficient irrigation facilities. At present, drought-stricken areas generally have a certain water conservancy foundation due to the large-scale water conservancy projects undertaken in the winter of 1957 and the Great Leap Forward in 1958. As long as we are good at using these facilities and give full play to their benefits, we can ensure that most of the drought-stricken land is irrigated. When thousands of troops are on the battlefield for emergency rescue, we should pay attention to improving irrigation technology and do a good job in organizing the rush irrigation. We should emphasize rational water use, adopt water-saving methods such as ditch irrigation, border irrigation, alternate ditch irrigation, shallow water frequent irrigation, and rice moist irrigation, improve irrigation efficiency, expand the benefited area, use surplus water to support neighboring areas, take into account upstream and downstream areas, work together, and maximize the effectiveness of water. Where irrigation facilities are imperfect, projects should be improved as soon as possible, channels should be repaired, and field projects should be added. Where water sources are insufficient, water sources should be opened up in many ways, intercepting water from the sky, diverting water from the ground, and developing groundwater. Grasping the three waters together is not only urgently needed for the current drought resistance, but also a long-term construction, which can enrich the material foundation for future agricultural production development.
    Increasing water lifting tools is another urgent problem to be solved in the fight against drought. This problem should be solved from many aspects based on the principle of focusing on local methods, supplemented by foreign methods, and combining local and foreign methods. Recently, local mechanical industry departments have produced a large number of water pumps to supply rural areas. The Ministry of Agriculture is also drawing a batch of water pumps from provinces and cities without drought to support drought-stricken areas. This will undoubtedly be of great help to the fight against drought; however, the number of water pumps transferred is still limited and cannot meet the needs of the current drought resistance. Moreover, it takes a certain amount of time to transfer and install these pumping machines, and it is impossible to give full play to their role immediately. Drought resistance is like fighting a fire, and we cannot wait. Existing water lifting tools in various drought-stricken areas still have great potential to be tapped, and the utilization rate should be greatly improved. Those that were previously transferred to industrial production should quickly return to the team, and those that are damaged or lack supporting facilities should organize forces to repair and assemble them on the spot. Those in use should also improve their operating skills and strengthen technical management to achieve rational use. At the same time, we must mobilize the strength of local handicrafts, make use of local materials, make simple things simple, and rush to make a large number of simple water lifting tools to meet the urgent needs of drought resistance.
    To completely overcome the drought, we must combine hard work with clever work, mobilize the masses and cadres to offer suggestions and ideas, and do everything possible to improve labor organization, improve tools, and improve labor efficiency. The Manan Production Team of Mashan People's Commune in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, has set an example in this regard. They originally used 20 waterwheels to draw water every day, which was still not enough to meet the needs. Later, they installed ball bearings on the waterwheels, saving 8 waterwheels and 36 laborers. The irrigation efficiency, however, increased from irrigating 12 mu per day to 66 mu.
    Areas with severe drought must focus on drought resistance. However, many disasters are often closely related. For example, drought can easily cause insects, and floods can easily be affected by diseases. Now, many places have not only experienced drought, but also insect disasters. If we do not pay attention to pest control while fighting drought, the grain seized from the drought may be lost to insect disasters. If there are heavy rains, floods may also occur. Therefore, we should also pay attention to clearing drainage ditches and prepare for flood prevention.
    Drought resistance work should take different measures according to the different crops and the degree of drought in different areas. Water sources and irrigation equipment should first serve areas and crops severely affected by drought, but general areas should also be taken care of. If drought is not prevented immediately in areas with mild drought, the disaster will become more serious and losses will occur.
    In order to strengthen the fight against drought, we must first make more rational arrangements for labor. We must give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, strengthen unified leadership, and organize large-scale cooperation or large-scale corps operations to meet the urgent needs of the fight against drought. Of course, whether it is large-scale cooperation or small-scale cooperation, we must adhere to the principles of equivalent exchange and mutual assistance and mutual benefit. Secondly, industrial, commercial, transportation and other related departments should cooperate closely and fully support farmers in drought resistance. Industrial departments should complete the production tasks of drought resistance machinery and equipment ahead of schedule, commercial departments should strive to do a good job in supplying drought resistance materials, transportation departments should ensure the timely transportation of drought resistance materials and equipment, material management units and industrial and mining enterprises should mobilize materials that can support drought resistance and put them into drought resistance, and health departments should organize medical personnel to go to the countryside to carry out heatstroke prevention, epidemic prevention, and medical work to ensure the health of the drought-fighting masses. Agricultural and water conservancy departments should also do a good job in technical guidance and act as consultants in the fight against drought. Further understand water resources and study drought prevention and resistance measures, summarize experience, and prepare for large-scale water conservancy movements in the future. Government employees, officers and soldiers, industrial and commercial employees and urban residents in drought-stricken areas should also go to the countryside and fields as much as possible to fight the drought with the farmers. Regions and regions, communes and communes should strengthen cooperation, support each other, and exchange what they have.
    Carrying the struggle against drought through to the end is a major and urgent task for the Chinese people in their struggle against various disasters this year. In all areas where drought has occurred, Party organizations must overcome any right-leaning conservative thinking and pessimistic complacency, resolutely lead the people, go all out, and fight tenaciously to the final victory in order to completely overcome the drought and ensure a good autumn harvest.

### 把抗旱斗争进行到底

　　把抗旱斗争进行到底
    一个伟大的群众性的抗旱斗争，在党的领导下已经胜利展开了，全国有六千多万群众以翻江倒海的气概，投入了艰巨的抗旱斗争。河南省每天投入抗旱斗争的群众、干部有两千多万，他们在“全党动员，万民出征”，“有旱抗到底，无雨保丰收”的口号下日夜奋战，与天争粮。经过半个多月的斗争，就使六千多万亩受旱土地分别浇了一遍、两遍或三遍。湖北省人民以最大的努力，鼓足干劲，掀起了抗旱高潮。这个省抢救的农作物已达一千六百多万亩。山东、湖南、安徽、四川、江苏、江西等省也都各有数百万抗旱大军，坚持抗旱斗争。经过抢救的作物，一般生长良好。湖北九百多万亩中稻，穗大粒饱，丰收在望。今年的旱灾是严重的，但是久经考验的我国人民，在党的领导下，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，一定能够制服干旱的威胁，确保丰收。
    目前旱象还在继续发展，我们决不能满足于已有的成绩，决不能松懈麻痹。应该清醒地认识到，要战胜干旱，还需要进行艰巨的工作。当前天气干燥炎热，又多旱风袭击，水分蒸发很快，还没有灌溉抢救的作物，受旱程度正在迅速加深，已经抢救的作物，也会很快脱水或失墒，有再度受旱的可能。根据天气预报，大部受旱地区最近一个时期仍将持续缺雨，旱象还要继续发展。面对这种形势，受旱地区的党政领导干部和广大群众，必须进一步鼓足干劲，反对松劲情绪，继续排除万难，与干旱斗争到底。
    为了集中力量抗旱，农村可停可缓的工作应该停止或缓期进行，以便集中全力，进行抗旱抢救。目前旱象刚刚露头的地区，要抓紧时机及早动员起来，力争迅速扑灭旱象；可能发生旱象的地区，也要提高警惕，加强戒备，有旱抗旱，无旱防旱。受旱的水稻产区要坚持抗旱防旱到中稻晚稻的丰收，受旱的杂粮和小麦产区不仅要坚持到秋季作物丰收，而且还要保证秋耕秋种的按时完成。
    要取得抗旱斗争的彻底胜利，必须妥善解决一系列具体问题。当前防旱抗旱中一个最重要的问题，就是要充分利用水源，节约用水，并在灌溉设施不足的地区大力开辟水源。目前受旱地区由于1957年冬天和1958年大跃进中大兴水利，一般都有一定的水利基础，只要善于利用这些设备，充分发挥它的效益，就可以保证大部分的受旱土地得到灌溉。在千军万马上阵进行紧急抢救的情况下，应该注意提高灌溉技术，做好抢浇的组织工作。强调合理用水，采用沟灌、畦灌、隔沟灌、浅水勤灌和水稻湿润灌溉等节省水量的办法，提高灌溉效率，扩大受益面积，用余水支援友邻地区，上下游兼顾，同心协力，最大限度地发挥水的效用。灌溉设施不完善的地方，应当尽快改善工程，修通渠道，增添田间工程。水源不足的地方，应当多方面开辟水源，拦蓄天上水，引取地面水，开发地下水，三水齐抓，这不仅是目前抗旱所急需，而且也是一项长期建设，可以为今后发展农业生产充实物质基础。
    增加提水工具，是抗旱斗争中的另一个急待解决的问题。对于这个问题应该本着以土为主，以洋为辅，土洋并举的原则，从多方面去解决。最近，各地机械工业部门已经生产了大量的抽水机供应农村。农业部也正在从没有旱象的省市抽借一批抽水机支援受旱地区。这无疑对抗旱斗争将有很大帮助；但是抽调的数量还是有限的，不能满足目前抗旱斗争的需要，而且调运安装这些抽水机械也需要一定的时间，不可能马上全部发挥作用。抗旱如救火，不能等待。各受旱地区现有提水工具还有很大潜力可以挖掘，应该大大提高利用率。过去抽调到工业生产上的要迅速归队，损坏了的缺乏配套的应当组织力量就地赶修装配。正在使用的也要提高操作水平，加强技术管理，达到合理使用。同时还要发动地方手工业的力量，就地取材，因陋就简，大量赶制简易提水工具，以适应抗旱急需。
    要彻底战胜旱灾，必须苦干与巧干相结合，要发动群众、干部献计献策，千方百计改进劳动组织，改进工具，提高劳动效率。湖北江陵县马山人民公社马南生产队在这方面做出了榜样，他们原来每天用二十部水车车水，还赶不上需要，后来在水车上安上了滚珠轴承，节省了八部水车，三十六个劳力，灌田效率，却由每天灌溉十二亩，提高到六十六亩。
    旱情严重地区必须以抗旱为中心。但是许多灾害常常有着密切联系。例如旱了容易生虫，涝了易受病害。现在很多地方不但发生了旱灾，而且发生虫灾，如果在抗旱的同时，不注意治虫，从旱灾中夺回来的粮食又可能要损失在虫灾上，如有暴雨，还有可能发生水灾。因此，还要注意清理排水沟道，准备防涝防水。
    抗旱工作应根据不同作物、不同地区的受旱程度，采取不同措施。水源和灌溉设备，首先应当为受旱严重的地区和作物服务，但是也应该照顾一般地区。旱情轻微地区如不即时防旱，灾情也会变重，也会造成损失。
    为了加强抗旱斗争，首先要求对劳动力作更合理的安排。要充分发挥人民公社优越性，加强统一领导，组织大协作或大兵团作战，以符合抗旱斗争的紧急需要。当然，不论是实行大范围内协作或是小范围内协作，都要坚持等价交换和互助互利的原则。其次，工业、商业、交通运输业等有关部门，应当密切协作，全力支援农民抗旱。工业部门要提前完成抗旱机具的生产任务，商业部门要努力做好抗旱物资的供应工作，交通部门要保证抗旱物资器材的及时运输，物资管理单位及工矿企业要把可以支援抗旱的物资动员起来，投入抗旱，卫生部门应当组织医务人员下乡，进行防暑、防疫和医疗工作，保证抗旱群众的身体健康。农业和水利部门，更要做好技术指导工作，在抗旱斗争中当好参谋。进一步了解水利资源和研究防旱抗旱措施，总结经验，为今后大搞水利运动作好准备。受旱地区的机关职工、部队官兵、工商业从业人员和城市居民，也要尽可能地下乡下田，和农民一道抗御旱灾。地区和地区之间、公社和公社之间，要加强协作，相互支援，互通有无。
    把抗旱斗争进行到底，这是我国人民今年同各种灾害斗争中的一项重大的紧迫的任务。凡是发生旱灾地区，党组织必须克服任何右倾保守思想和悲观松劲情绪，坚决领导人民，鼓足干劲，为彻底战胜干旱，确保秋季丰收，顽强地斗争到最后胜利。
