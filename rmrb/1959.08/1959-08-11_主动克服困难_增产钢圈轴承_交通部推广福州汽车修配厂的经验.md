Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 10th: The Ministry of Transportation recently held an on-site meeting in Fuzhou, introducing and promoting the experience of Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory in manufacturing steel rims and bearings to representatives from transportation departments in twenty-three provinces and autonomous regions across the country.

The wheel steel rim is an important part of a car. Since the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country last year, transportation has become increasingly busy, and various regions have vigorously developed automobile trailer transportation. However, because steel rims and bearings are in short supply, a large number of trailers produced cannot be fully utilized. The Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory adopted indigenous methods and self-made equipment to produce steel rims and bearings, solving a key problem for the development of automobile trailer transportation. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has produced more than four hundred sets of steel rims and a large number of bearings, which can be assembled into more than four hundred trailers. Putting them all into transportation is equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of more than four hundred cars.

In the process of manufacturing steel rims and bearings, the workers of the Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory overcame many difficulties. Initially, the workers used the steel they had smelted last year to cast "split steel rims," but this type of steel rim could not be installed with dual tires, and it was time-consuming to process, consumed a lot of materials, and was not easy to maintain. Later, the factory sent people to Shanghai to visit. After returning, the workshop director Lin Xi, labor model Wang Yingchun, and other workers, through continuous experimentation and improvement, finally used steel plates to make "spoke-type steel rims." This type of steel rim can be installed with dual tires, does not require processing, and greatly saves materials. Later, the workers also made their own rolling mill to roll retaining rings, changing the screw-fitted tires to retaining ring-fitted ones. In addition, the workers also manufactured fourteen machines themselves, greatly improving the production efficiency of ball bearings.

During the on-site meeting, representatives from twenty-three provinces and regions across the country unanimously praised the communist spirit of the workers of the Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory for daring to think and act, and resolved to learn from them, vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement, and accelerate the development of the transportation industry.

### 主动克服困难　增产钢圈轴承　交通部推广福州汽车修配厂的经验

　　主动克服困难　增产钢圈轴承
　　交通部推广福州汽车修配厂的经验
    新华社福州10日电　交通部最近在福州召开现场会议，向全国二十三个省和自治区交通部门的代表，介绍推广了福州汽车修配厂制造钢圈和轴承的经验。
    车轮钢圈是汽车的重要部件。去年全国各地工农业生产大跃进以来，交通运输越来越繁忙，各地都大力发展汽车拖带运输，但是因为钢圈和轴承等供不应求，制造出的大批挂车不能全部使用起来。福州汽车修配厂采用土法上马，自制设备，生产钢圈和轴承，为发展汽车拖带运输解决了一个关键问题。今年以来，这个厂一共生产了四百多套钢圈和大批轴承，可以装配四百多辆挂车，全部投入运输之后等于增加四百多辆汽车的运输能力。
    在制造钢圈和轴承的过程中，福州汽车修配厂的职工克服了不少的困难。起初，职工们用去年自己炼出的钢浇铸成“分裂式钢圈”，但是这种钢圈不能双胎并装，而且加工费时，花费材料多，也不便于保养。后来厂里派人去上海参观，回来以后，车间主任林曦、劳动模范王应春和其他工人一起，经过不断试验和改进，终于用钢板制成了“轮辐式钢圈”。这种钢圈可以双胎并装，也不用加工，材料大大节省了。以后，工人们又自制了一台轧钢机轧制挡圈，改螺丝套装轮胎为挡圈套装。此外，工人们还自己制造了十四台机器，大大提高了滚珠轴承的生产效率。
    在现场会议期间，来自全国二十三个省区的代表，一致赞扬福州汽车修配厂职工敢想敢作的共产主义风格，决心向他们学习，大力开展技术革新运动，加速发展交通运输事业。
