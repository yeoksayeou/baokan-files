Song of the Road-Building Warriors
Ji Peng
The road marker warrior carries a bamboo basket on his shoulder,
Inside the bamboo basket are road markers.
The scenery of mountains and seas is infinitely good,
The road markers eagerly jump out of the basket:
	I will go to the mountains to clear the dense forest,
	I will go to the steep cliffs to chisel dangerous paths,
	I will go to the streams and the beaches of the sea,
	I will go to the canyons to build flying bridges…
A row of road markers穿山野，
Flowers and plants surround the road markers and smile,
Larks fly to the road markers and call,
All hoping for an early spring.
How much trust and determination,
How many eyes are watching,
Road markers—order to advance,
Road markers—sign of benefiting the people.
Road markers come with the warriors,
Road markers raise golden ribbons and flutter,
Road markers pull the cars along,
Road markers bring new songs.
A basket of sweat, a basket of songs,
Climbing mountains, wading through streams, crossing small bridges,
Today we plant thousands of road markers,
Tomorrow we will pave the sunny road.

Blasting Before the Rain
Ink clouds press against distant peaks before the rain,
Thunder rumbles faintly,
Seizing the time before the rain to cut down the mountains,
Solid rocks burst into sparks.
Swinging sledgehammers to chisel high mountains,
Golden yellow dynamite buried in the holes,
The sound of thunder is getting closer,
Rolling ink clouds engulf nearby peaks.
The fuse spits blue smoke,
Warning whistles fill the valley,
Lightning whips the sky, thunder shakes the ears,
Heavy rain obscures the nearby peaks.
Thunderbolts crack in the sky,
Mountain blasting roars,
Clouds shoot rain arrows downwards,
A rain of stones flies high.
The thunder recedes, the rain is gone,
Warriors wear rainbows on their shoulders,
Shaving off half of the high mountain,
A road to the clouds hangs on the green peaks.

Happiness Avenue, the Army Advances

Happiness Avenue, the army advances,
A hot and lively start,
	Removing weeds, splitting cliffs,
Not afraid of wind, rain, or sun,
Songs fly to the clouds,
Road-building warriors are so heroic.

Happiness Avenue, the army advances,
	Golden dragons coil around the mountains, radiating light,
Transporting fresh fish and kelp,
Machinery and jewelry rolling in,
Fruit trees and flowers planted all over the mountains,
Taking a bus to climb the mountain and look at the four seas.

Happiness Avenue, the army advances,
The small island is more beautiful and lovely,
Sea island highway connects to Beijing,
Beijing road leads to the frontier,
Years of hard work, thousands of years of happiness,
The great army's heroic name will be passed down for generations.

    筑路战士的歌
    纪鹏
    插路标战士肩头挑竹筐，竹筐里面装路标，山海风光无限好，路标争向筐外跳：我去山中开密林，我去峭崖凿险道，我去溪流、大海滩，我去峡谷架飞桥……一排路标穿山野，花草围着路标笑，百灵飞向路标叫，都盼春早到。多少信任和决心，多少眼睛往这瞧，路标——进军令，路标——造福标。路标随着战士来，路标扯起金带飘，路标牵着汽车跑，路标带来新歌谣。一筐汗水一筐歌，爬山涉水过小桥，今日插下路标千万棵，明日铺起阳关道。
  雨前爆破墨云压远峰，雷声隐隐鸣，抢在雨前斩大山，坚石迸火星。抡起大锤凿高山，黄灿灿炸药埋孔中，雷声隆隆声渐近，滚滚墨云吞近峰。导火索，吐蓝烟，警戒哨音满谷鸣，闪电鞭天雷震耳，急雨遮近峰。空中霹雳裂天响，山上爆破轰轰轰，云射雨箭下，石雨飞高空。雷隐去，雨无踪，战士肩头披彩虹，削去高山大半座，连云大路挂青峰。
  幸福大路大军开
  幸福大路大军开，
  热火朝天干起来，
    除野草，劈石崖，
  不怕风雨太阳晒，
  歌声飞到云霄外，
  筑路战士多豪迈。
  幸福大路大军开，
    金龙盘山放光彩，
  运出鲜鱼和海带，
  机器、珠宝滚滚来，
  果树鲜花栽满山，
  乘车登山望四海。
  幸福大路大军开，
  小岛更美更可爱，
  海岛公路连北京，
  北京大路通边塞，
  几年辛苦千年乐，
  大军英名传万代。
