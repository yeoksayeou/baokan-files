Shanghai, August 9th (Reported by our newspaper) Shanghai is launching a new high tide of industrial production throughout the city. The momentum of over one million workers fighting hard in August and September has begun to take shape.

At the beginning of August, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) deployed work to focus on grasping August and September and launching a new upsurge in production increase and economy. Party committees at all levels, industrial bureaus, trade unions, and even many factories, have held cadre meetings and mass rallies to discuss and arrange the work, according to the instructions of the Municipal Committee. At a cadre meeting held by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions on July 7th, Ma Tianshui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, analyzed the new situation facing the city's industrial front. He asked all workers and cadres in the city to seize the opportunity, take swift action, further boost their drive, focus on grasping, grasping hard, and making every effort to tap potential, overcome the right-leaning and slack mood among some cadres, and launch a new upsurge in production increase and economy. He pointed out that a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy is gradually taking shape in the city. In order to better develop this movement, it is necessary to carry forward the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year. On the one hand, we must vigorously launch mass movements, and on the other hand, we must do solid and meticulous work. During the movement, attention should be paid to closely combining high output, high quality, and economy. We must continue to mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and at the same time combine the vigorous mass movement with strengthening enterprise management. Leading cadres at all levels should continue to implement the spirit of rectification, fully mobilize the masses, firmly rely on the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and care for the lives of the masses. In the past few days, the vast number of cadres and workers in the city have been enthusiastically studying the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Mood and Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" and have been conducting discussions. They are determined to muster greater efforts to work hard in August and September, create greater achievements, and welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

The emergence of this new upsurge is a new development in the red flag competition for high output, high quality, and strict economy this year. Since the beginning of this year, the city's workers have been in high spirits, vigorously carrying out technological innovation, technological revolution, and improving enterprise management. The total industrial output value in the first seven months has completed 49.24% of the annual plan, an increase of 52% compared with the same period last year. The city's workers have been working hard and diligently, and have put forward more than 250,000 suggestions for technological innovation and technological revolution in the first half of the year, an increase of 67.2% compared with the same period last year, more than half of which have been implemented; various industries have also successfully trial-produced more than 11,000 new products and new varieties, an increase of one and a half times compared with the same period last year, nearly half of which have been put into production. The iron and steel industry is advancing bravely, and the average daily output of steel is higher month by month. In July, they overcame the high temperature, and the output was even higher every ten days. After the iron and steel, machinery, electrical machinery, textile, and light industry departments mobilized the masses to check quality and strengthen technical management, the product quality has generally improved. Among the twenty-five major categories of products in the textile industry, the quality of twenty categories has been improved; among the one hundred and ten products in the light industry, the quality of about one hundred has been significantly improved. Various industries have also launched a large-scale inventory movement, adjusted materials, made every effort to increase the production of raw materials, and carried out economy activities, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and achieved good experiences. Recently, various industrial departments have seized this favorable situation, conducted a major inspection and comparison of the red flag competition in the previous period, summed up experience, set up red flags, and launched a new high tide of production.

In the past few days, the situation on the city's industrial front has developed rapidly. The vast number of workers are closely focusing on the current key to production and are further vigorously carrying out technological innovation, technological revolution, and improving enterprise management. A vigorous and solid upsurge of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with advanced elements has formed in many industries and many factories. The city's steelworkers are fighting hard in front of the hot steelmaking furnaces, racing each other in production, quickly charging materials, and quickly smelting. The average daily output of steel in the first week of August increased by 17% compared with July. The Construction Machinery Factory, which undertakes the arduous task of manufacturing fertilizer, converter, and other equipment, has doubled its tasks in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. However, the workers are in high spirits and have launched challenges and responses, determined to complete the third quarter tasks ten days ahead of schedule and strive for full red production every month. In the first five days of August, they realized sixteen major innovation suggestions, which greatly shortened the processing time of products. The air inlet shaft on the converter equipment originally planned to take seventy-two working hours to process one, but the second group of the turner section shortened it to eighteen working hours by improving equipment and process routes. The factory's leading cadres have also adopted the method of "arranging every ten days, inspecting every five days, and grasping the progress every day" according to the experience of "grasping the beginning of the month, striving for the middle of the month, and winning the end of the month" since this year. The production plan of each group is implemented to the end according to person, machine, and time, and the group statistics work is strengthened to check and supervise. The factory director also led a group of cadres to go deep into the workshop to help the group analyze the characteristics of the task, study measures, and solve the key to production. The Chengfu Iron Factory also has a very arduous task in the third quarter, to complete 34% of the annual plan. However, the actual manpower is less than half of the required manpower. The workers were not intimidated by the difficulties and put forward the slogan "Drive should be encouraged again and again, to strive for the top again and again." In the first few days of August, they put forward more than 1,000 innovation suggestions for the current production. After these suggestions are realized, the difficulty of insufficient working hours can be basically solved. In order to further implement the plan, each workshop also held a swearing-in meeting and organized hooking competitions. 100% of the groups in the factory have been hooked up, and more than 90% of individuals and types of work have launched competitions. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, they actively sought allocation from higher authorities on the one hand; on the other hand, they found their own way out, tapped potential within the factory, picked out the better quality from a batch of pig iron accumulated in the factory and tried to use it as much as possible, and returned the scrapped pig iron castings to the furnace for reuse, doing everything possible to meet the needs of production. In the past few days, new production achievements and new technological reforms have appeared in many factories one after another. On the afternoon of August 5, the Daxin Chemical Factory successfully tested and reformed the process route for manufacturing borax, shortening the process and reducing the cost by 30%, which can save 1,000 tons of borax powder and 400 tons of caustic soda a year.

Guangzhou, August 9th (Reported by our newspaper) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC held a telephone conference on the industrial transportation front on August 3rd, calling for seizing August and September, fully completing the third quarter production plan, and welcoming the National Day. The meeting pointed out that Guangdong's industrial production in the first half of this year increased by 54% compared with the same period last year, and transportation increased by 41%. The situation in July was even more progressive.

The meeting pointed out that now it has turned to the mid-stage of the third quarter, August has already begun, which is a critical moment to complete this year's production tasks, and there are many favorable conditions. For example, the rainy season has basically passed; the supply of agricultural and sideline products is gradually increasing, and the busy summer harvest and summer planting are nearing the end, and the gaps in agricultural affairs can be fully utilized; the supply of raw materials is tending to improve. Therefore, all localities should make full use of this favorable situation and appropriate opportunity, forge ahead, work hard, and launch a new upsurge in industrial and transportation production, and strive to complete the production tasks.

The meeting pointed out that the current tasks are: first of all, to grasp political and ideological work. It is necessary to educate cadres and the masses so that they recognize that the implemented plan must be based on boosting morale and striving for the top, and must not be placed on a backward basis. After the plan is implemented, it must be worked hard to complete it, and it must not be waited for success. At the same time, in specific work, it is also necessary to focus on the production of raw materials and machinery and equipment, strengthen equipment maintenance, actively restore and develop the production of daily necessities, further carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and effectively solve the livelihood problems of factory and mine workers.

The local committees participating in the meeting believed that the provincial committee's analysis of the current situation was correct, and the proposed measures were practical and feasible, and expressed that they would immediately launch an in-depth and meticulous ideological movement and a vigorous production movement, fight hard in August and September, and create new achievements to welcome the National Day.

Kunming, August 9th (Reported by our newspaper) The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC issued a notice requesting party organizations and all cadres at all levels in the province to immediately study the People's Daily editorial on August 6th on "Overcoming Right-Leaning Mood and Vigorously Increasing Production and Practicing Economy."

In the notice, the Provincial Committee requested party organizations and all cadres at all levels in the province to criticize and overcome the right-leaning mood that has recently risen among some cadres through study and discussion, further boost their drive, strive for the top, and resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction with practical actions.

The Provincial Committee also requested party organizations and cadres at all levels to carry out propaganda and education to the broad masses in a timely and in-depth manner, fully mobilize the masses, boost their drive, make persistent efforts, seize the two months of August and September, and launch a vigorous new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, striving to complete and strive to overfulfill this year's leap forward plan, and welcome the great tenth anniversary of the National Day with greater achievements, according to the spirit of the People's Daily editorial and the Provincial Committee's specific deployment of current work in industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and other aspects.

Lanzhou, August 9th (Reported by our newspaper) The Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC issued a notice to party committees at all levels on the 7th on organizing all cadres and the broad masses of workers to conscientiously study the two People's Daily editorials.

The notice said: The People's Daily editorials on August 6th, "Overcoming Right-Leaning Mood and Vigorously Increasing Production and Practicing Economy," and on the 7th, "Overcoming Disasters and Striving for a Bumper Harvest," are extremely important, and party committees at all levels should immediately organize all cadres and the broad masses of workers to conscientiously study and discuss them. The notice required that through this study, we should resolutely criticize and overcome the right-leaning and slack mood that has recently risen among some cadres, fully mobilize the masses, boost their drive, strive for the top, and rapidly launch a new large-scale mass movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy on the province's industrial, agricultural, transportation, commercial, and other economic fronts, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan, and welcome the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    广东云南甘肃省委号召大干特干掀起增产节约的新高潮
    本报上海9日电　上海正在全市范围内掀起一个工业生产的新高潮，全市一百余万职工大战8、9月的声势已经开始形成。
    8月一开始，中共上海市委就对大抓8、9两月、掀起增产节约新高潮的工作作了部署。各区委、各工业局、工会直到许多工厂，都已根据市委指示，纷纷召开干部会议和群众大会，进行了讨论和安排。在7日市工会联合会召开的干部大会上，中共上海市委书记处书记马天水分析了全市工业战线面临的新形势。他要求全市职工和干部抓紧时机，迅速行动起来，进一步鼓足干劲，大抓、狠抓、千方百计地挖掘潜力，克服某些干部中的右倾松劲情绪，掀起增产节约新高潮。他指出：目前，一个增产节约运动的新高潮正在全市逐步形成，为了使这一运动更好地发展，必须发扬去年大跃进的经验，一方面要轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动，一方面又要踏踏实实做深入细致的工作。运动中要注意把高产、优质和节约密切结合，要继续发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，同时把大搞群众运动与加强企业管理结合起来。各级领导干部，要继续贯彻整风精神，充分发动群众，坚决依靠群众，与群众同甘共苦，并关心群众的生活。全市广大干部和工人，这几天正在热烈学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，纷纷进行漫谈讨论。决心鼓起更大干劲，在8、9月份大干一场，创造更大成绩，迎接国庆十周年。
    目前这个新高潮的出现，是今年以来高产优质厉行节约红旗竞赛的新发展。今年以来，全市职工群众干劲昂扬，大闹技术革新技术革命和改进企业管理，前七个月的工业总产值已完成年度计划的49.24％，比去年同期增长了52％。全市职工干劲加钻劲，在上半年中提出了二十五万多件技术革新和技术革命建议，比去年同期增加67.2％，其中一半以上已经实现；各行各业还试制成功了一万一千多种新产品新花色品种，比去年同期增加一倍半，其中将近一半已投入生产。钢铁工业奋勇前进，钢的平均日产量一月高过一月，7月战胜了高温，更是一旬高过一旬。钢铁、机械、电机、纺织、轻工业等部门发动群众检查质量，加强技术管理以后，产品质量已普遍提高。纺织工业二十五种大类产品中，质量已有改进的达二十种；轻工业一百十种产品中，质量显著提高的约有一百种。各行各业还展开了规模浩大的清仓运动，调剂物资，千方百计地增产原料材料，开展节约活动，克服了有些原料材料不足的困难，并取得了很好的经验。各个工业部门最近都抓住这个有利形势，对前一时期的红旗竞赛作了大检查大评比，总结了经验，树起了红旗，掀起了新的生产高潮。
    这几天，全市工业战线上的形势发展很快。广大职工群众紧紧围绕当前生产关键，正在进一步大闹技术革新、技术革命和改进企业管理，一个轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实的比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮，已在许多行业、许多工厂中形成。全市炼钢工人奋战在火热的炼钢炉前，生产上你追我赶，快速加料，快速冶炼，8月第一周钢的平均日产量又比7月份增长了17％。承担着繁重的化肥、转炉等设备制造任务的建设机器厂，第三季度任务比第二季度增加了一倍。而职工们干劲昂扬，展开了挑战应战，决心要提前十天完成第三季度任务，力争月月生产满堂红。8月前五天中，他们就实现了十六项重大的革新建议，大大缩短了产品加工工时。制造转炉设备上的进风轴原来计划需要七十二个工时加工一个，车工工段第二小组通过改进设备和工艺路线以后，便缩短为十八个工时。工厂的领导干部也根据今年以来“抓月初，争月中，夺月底”的经验，采取了“十天一安排，五天一检查，天天抓进度”的办法。每一个小组的生产计划都按人、按机器、按时间地落实到底，并加强了小组统计工作以便检查督促。厂长还带领了一批干部深入车间，具体帮助小组分析任务特点，研究措施，解决生产关键。诚孚铁工厂第三季度的任务也很艰巨，要完成全年计划的34％。但实际的人工还不及需要的人工的一半。职工们没有被困难吓倒，提出了“干劲要一鼓再鼓，上游要一争再争”的口号，在8月最初几天就针对当前生产提出了一千多条革新建议，这些建议实现以后，基本上可以解决工时不足的困难。为了使计划进一步落实，各车间还召开了誓师大会，组织挂钩竞赛。全厂100％的小组已挂上钩，90％以上的个人及工种之间展开了竞赛。为了解决原料材料不足的困难，他们又一方面积极向上级争取调拨；一方面自找出路，在厂内挖潜力，把厂里积存的一批质量很差的生铁，拣较好的尽量利用，把报废的生铁铸件进行回炉使用，尽一切可能满足生产的需要。这几天，新的生产成绩、新的技术改革，在许多工厂里接连出现。大新化工厂5日下午试验改革制造硼砂的工艺路线成功，缩短了工序，成本降低30％，一年可节约硼矿粉一千吨，烧碱四百吨。
    本报广州9日电　中共广东省委员会在8月3日举行工业交通运输战线电话会议，号召抓紧8、9月，全面完成第三季度生产计划，迎接国庆。会议指出：广东省今年上半年工业生产比去年同期增长54％，交通运输增长41％。7月份的情况更有进步。
    会议指出，现在已经转入第三季度的中期，8月份已经开始，正是完成今年生产任务带有关键性的时刻，并且有许多有利条件。如雨季基本过去；农副产品供应逐渐增加，夏收夏种大忙已近尾声，农事间隙可以充分利用；原料、材料供应趋向好转。因此，各地要充分利用这个有利的形势和适当的时机，勇往直前，大干特干，掀起工业和交通运输生产新高潮，努力完成生产任务。
    会议指出当前的任务是：首先要抓紧政治思想工作。要教育干部和群众，使他们认识落实的计划必须建立在鼓足干劲，力争上游的基础上，决不能放在落后的基础上。计划落实之后，必须努力去完成，决不能坐待其成。同时在具体工作中，还要大抓原材料和机械设备生产，加强设备维修工作，积极恢复和发展日用工业品的生产，进一步开展增产节约运动，切实解决厂矿职工生活问题。
    参加会议的各地委认为省委对当前形势的分析是正确的，提出的各点措施是切实可行的，表示要马上开展深入细致的思想运动和热火朝天的生产运动，大战8、9月，创造新成绩迎接国庆。
    本报昆明9日电　中共云南省委发出通知，要求全省各级党组织和全体干部立即学习8月6日人民日报关于“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论。
