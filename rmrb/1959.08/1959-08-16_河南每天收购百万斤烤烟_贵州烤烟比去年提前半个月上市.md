Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th August: Henan Province's flue-cured tobacco is entering the market in large quantities. In the past half month, the daily purchase volume has averaged around one million jin. As of the 10th, a cumulative total of more than 23.5 million jin has been purchased. The July purchase plan for flue-cured tobacco has been overfulfilled by 36%. Currently, the purchased flue-cured tobacco is being transported to railway lines from various locations.

This year, Henan Province planted more than 1.4 million mu of flue-cured tobacco. Due to earlier seedling cultivation and transplanting, the ripening season is generally about half a month earlier than in previous years. At present, the bottom leaves have been harvested and cured, and farmers are beginning to harvest and cure the second lower and middle leaves, used for Grade A and Grade B cigarettes, in large quantities.

Commercial departments, in light of the current severe drought situation, are purchasing flue-cured tobacco while supplying drought-resistance materials to support farmers in watering and irrigating the fields. They are also assisting production teams of various people's communes in properly arranging labor to simultaneously combat the drought, harvest and cure tobacco leaves, and tie them into bundles for sale.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 15th August: Guizhou flue-cured tobacco has entered the market more than half a month earlier than last year. Commercial departments at all levels in the province have organized more than 12,000 people to go to tobacco-producing areas to purchase flue-cured tobacco. According to preliminary statistics from 24 counties and cities, more than 1,500 dan of flue-cured tobacco have already been purchased.

This year, Guizhou Province's more than 700,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco were planted in a timely manner, and the ripening period is generally more than 20 days earlier than last year. Various localities have increased the number of purchase points and strengthened the number of purchasing personnel and technical cadres according to need.

During the purchase process, commercial departments have sent people to tobacco-producing areas, relying on the local Party committees, to cooperate closely with farmers. They are responsible for the entire process, from picking, curing, grading, tying, inspecting, to packaging and transportation; at the same time, they are universally promoting the "semi-air drying and semi-curing" method of curing tobacco to speed up the curing process. In terms of transportation, in addition to setting up transportation stations on main transportation routes to handle the centralized consignment of flue-cured tobacco, commercial departments pay special attention to helping communes establish professional transportation teams, signing transportation contracts with communes and production teams for timely transportation; they also maintain close contact with transportation departments to carry out incidental transportation. Therefore, various localities have basically achieved picking, curing, grading and tying, purchasing, packaging, and transferring in a timely manner.

At present, while picking and curing, farmers are continuously strengthening the late-stage field management of tobacco leaves, planning to increase the harvest of the third crop and sucker tobacco. Commercial departments are transferring more than 1,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to supply tobacco-producing areas for topdressing.

    河南每天收购百万斤烤烟
    贵州烤烟比去年提前半个月上市
    据新华社郑州15日电　河南省烤烟大量上市。近半个月来，每日收购量平均有一百万斤左右。截至10日止，累计已收购二千三百五十多万斤。7月份的烤烟收购计划已超额36％完成。目前，各地收购的烤烟正源源运到铁路沿线。
    河南省今年播种的一百四十多万亩烤烟，由于育苗、移栽较早，成熟季节普遍比往年提前半个月左右。现在，土脚烟已经收烤完毕，农民们开始大量收烤制甲级乙级卷烟用的下二棚烟叶和腰部烟叶。
    商业部门根据当前旱情严重的情况，一面采购烤烟，一面供应抗旱物资，支援农民浇水灌田，并且帮助各人民公社的生产队妥善安排劳力，做到边抗旱，边收烤烟叶，边扎把出售。
    据新华社贵阳15日电　贵州烤烟比去年提前半个多月上市。全省各级商业部门已组织一万二千多人，到产烟区去收购烤烟。据二十四县、市最近的初步统计，已收购烤烟一千五百多担。
    今年，贵州省七十多万亩烤烟，栽种及时，成熟期一般比去年提前二十多天。各地根据需要，增设了采购点，充实了采购人员和技术干部。
    在收购中，商业部门派人到烤烟产区，依靠当地党委，同农民密切合作，从采摘、烘烤、分级扎把、验收到打包运输，一直分工负责到底；同时普遍推广“半晾半烘”的烘烟法，加快烘烤速度。在运输方面，商业部门除了在交通要道设立运输站，办理烤烟的集中托运以外，特别注意帮助公社建立专业运输队，与公社、生产队签订运输合同，及时运送；又和交通部门紧密联系，开展捎脚运输。因此，各地基本上做到了随采摘、随烘烤、随分级扎把、随收购、随打包、随调运。
    目前，农民们在采摘烘烤的同时，正不断加强烟叶的后期田间管理，计划在三道烟和杈子烟上增加收获量。商业部门正在调运一千多吨化学肥料，供给产烟区作追肥。
