Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, Chile, August 19th: The Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Chilean Communist Party issued a statement on the recently concluded Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas in Santiago, calling on the people of Latin America to unite more closely to oppose US interference in Cuba.

The statement said that the results of the meeting fully confirmed the predictions of Latin American communists and other democratic forces, namely, that this meeting would never do anything beneficial to the people of our countries. Particularly serious is the resolution granting new special powers to the so-called Inter-American Peace Committee, which in effect gives this committee the power to interfere in the affairs of the Caribbean region. Representatives of some countries believed that the Organization of American States could contribute to promoting the transition of dictatorial countries such as Dominica, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Paraguay in a progressive direction. Facts have proved that this is just an unattainable illusion. Facts have also shattered the dreams of those who hoped that the Organization of American States would be concerned about their urgent economic problems. The statement said that this organization is nothing more than a tool of US imperialism in Latin America. It is a knife in Washington's hand, and its edge is only pointed at the people of Latin American countries. The statement said that the Organization of American States should not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and the Cuban issue is solely a matter for the Cuban people. Changing the current situation in Dominica, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Paraguay can only be the result of the struggle of the people of these countries with the support of all progressive forces in Latin America and the world. The Organization of American States must not carry out interventions that benefit US imperialism.

The statement emphasized that support for Cuba is more necessary than ever. Supporting the struggle of the people of dictatorial countries such as Dominica and Nicaragua has been put on the agenda. In every country and throughout Latin America, it is increasingly urgent to unite the forces against US imperialism and its lackeys more closely. We, the people of Latin America, are stronger than US imperialism and its accomplices. We can achieve victory by uniting.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, August 19th: A group of university students in the Argentine capital held a demonstration march on the central streets here yesterday in support of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution. When passing the US Embassy, the demonstrators shouted slogans against the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: According to TASS, Montevideo, August 18th: The mass movement in Latin American countries in support of the Cuban Revolution is expanding.

According to the Venezuelan "Popular Tribune," committees to support Cuba are being established in Latin American countries, and volunteer teams are being organized to defend the Cuban Revolution from foreign aggression. For example, a volunteer army committee has been established in Colombia, and these volunteers have expressed their willingness to go to Cuba to participate in the struggle against the conspiracies of imperialist elements.

On the 17th, the working people of Uruguay held a mass meeting in the auditorium of the University of Uruguay in Montevideo, with the slogan "No Interference in Cuba." Participants in the meeting firmly condemned attempts to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and issued a statement expressing their support for the Cuban Revolution. Representatives of various political parties, trade unions, and student groups who spoke at the meeting emphasized that defending the Cuban Revolution is the common cause of the people of Latin American countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 19th: Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Raúl Castro reiterated his opposition to the Organization of American States' interference in Cuba's internal affairs in a speech here yesterday. Local newspapers widely published his speech today. Raúl Castro said that the purpose of the Organization of American States in convening this meeting of foreign ministers was to oppose the revolution. He believes that it failed to achieve its purpose because "to destroy Cuba, it is necessary to eliminate Latin American public opinion." Raúl Castro arrived in Santiago yesterday and gave a speech at a press conference held late that day, and answered questions raised by reporters.

Raúl Castro fiercely condemned the United States. He said that the United States is the chief instigator of counter-revolutionary movements inside and outside the Organization of American States. The Organization of American States did not think of Cuba during the Batista tyranny, but only thought of Cuba now that the people are in power. He said that Cuba will never allow this international organization to carry out any interference in its territory. On the contrary, whoever wants to engage in counter-revolution will suffer a crushing defeat. The Organization of American States and the US news agencies are talking a lot about Cuba's elections, but they have forgotten the same problems that exist under dictatorial regimes like Trujillo and Somoza; in Cuba, only counter-revolutionaries, mainly domestic and foreign landlords, are demanding elections, and their purpose is to weaken the internal front.

When a reporter asked him for his opinion on communism, Raúl Castro said that he had no opinion, but he could talk about capitalism, because he had personally experienced the evils of capitalism. He said that now, some people are putting the label of communism on everything good that the people do. Even without communists, they would find other excuses, because what really makes them uneasy is Cuba's land reform and other revolutionary measures.

　　拉丁美洲声援古巴革命运动日益扩大
    智共号召各国人民加紧团结反对美国干涉
    劳尔·卡斯特罗谴责美国是策动反革命的魁首
    据新华社智利圣地亚哥19日电　智利共产党中央委员会政治委员会就刚在圣地亚哥闭幕的美洲外长会议发表声明，号召拉丁美洲人民更加紧密地团结起来，反对美国干涉古巴。
    声明说，会议的结果充分证实了拉丁美洲共产党人及其他民主力量的预言，即这次会议绝不会做出有利于我们各国人民的事。特别严重的是授给所谓泛美和平委员会新的特别权力的决议，它实际上给了这个委员会以干涉加勒比海地区事务的权力。某些国家的代表曾认为，美洲国家组织可以为促使多米尼加、海地、尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭等独裁国家向进步的方向转变做出贡献，事实证明，这只是不能实现的幻想。事实也使那些指望美洲国家组织能关心他们迫切的经济问题的人们的梦想破灭了。声明说，这个组织只不过是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的一个工具而已。它是华盛顿掌握的一把刀子，它的锋芒仅仅指向拉丁美洲各国人民。声明说，美洲国家组织不应该干涉任何国家的内政，古巴的事情仅仅是古巴人民的事情。改变多米尼加、海地、尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭的目前状况，只能是这些国家的人民在拉丁美洲和全世界一切进步力量的支持下进行斗争的结果。美洲国家组织不得进行对美国帝国主义有利的干涉。
    声明强调指出，支援古巴比过去任何时候都需要。支持多米尼加、尼加拉瓜等独裁国家人民的斗争已经提到日程上来了。在每个国家和在整个拉丁美洲都越来越迫切地需要使反对美帝国主义及其仆从的队伍团结得更加紧密。我们拉丁美洲人民比美帝国主义及其走卒更强大。我们团结起来就能得到胜利。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯19日电　阿根廷首都的一批大学生昨天在这里的中心街道举行示威游行，支持菲德尔·卡斯特罗和古巴革命。在经过美国大使馆的时候，示威者高呼反对美国的口号。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚18日讯：拉丁美洲各国声援古巴革命的群众运动日益扩大。
    据委内瑞拉“人民论坛报”报道，拉丁美洲各国正在纷纷成立声援古巴委员会，并组织保卫古巴革命不受外来侵犯的志愿队。例如，在哥伦比亚成立了志愿军委员会，这些志愿者都表示愿意到古巴去参加反对帝国主义分子阴谋的斗争。
    乌拉圭劳动人民17日在蒙得维的亚乌拉圭大学礼堂举行了群众大会，大会的口号是“不准干涉古巴”。参加会议者坚决谴责干涉古巴内政的企图，并且发表声明表示声援古巴革命。在会上发言的各政党、工会和学生团体的代表都着重指出，保卫古巴革命是拉丁美洲各国人民的共同事业。
    新华社圣地亚哥19日电　古巴武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗昨天在这里发表谈话时重申反对美洲国家组织干涉古巴内政的立场。这里的报纸今天普遍地刊载了他的这次谈话。劳尔·卡斯特罗说，美洲国家组织召集这次外长会议的目的是反对革命。他认为，它没能达到目的，因为“要摧毁古巴，就必须消灭拉丁美洲的舆论”。劳尔·卡斯特罗是昨天到达圣地亚哥的，他在当天深夜举行的记者招待会上发表了谈话，并回答了记者提出的问题。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗猛烈地谴责了美国。他说，美国是在美洲国家组织内外策动反革命运动的魁首。美洲国家组织在巴蒂斯塔暴政统治的时候并没有想起古巴，只是在人民执政的现在才想起了古巴。他说，古巴永远不会让这个国际组织在它的领土上进行任何干涉。相反地，谁要是想搞反革命，谁就要碰得头破血流。美洲国家组织和美国的通讯社大谈什么古巴的选举，但是它们却忘记了像特鲁希略和索摩查这样的独裁政权下所存在的同样问题；在古巴，只有反革命分子，其中主要是本国和外国的地主要求举行选举，他们的目的是削弱内部阵线。
    当记者问他对于共产主义的意见时，劳尔·卡斯特罗说，他没有什么意见，但是他却可以谈谈关于资本主义的问题，因为他亲身尝受过资本主义的恶果。他说，现在，有人把人民做的一切好事都加上共产主义的帽子，就是没有共产党人，他们也会寻找别的借口，因为真正使他们坐卧不安的是古巴的土地改革和其他革命措施。
