　　After a Debate, Identifying Favorable Conditions
　　Dengjiatang Commune Launches a Late Autumn Production Upsurge
　　(Our newspaper, Changsha, 17th dispatch) The Dengjiatang People's Commune in Chen County, Hunan Province, through criticism of the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres, quickly launched a vigorous late autumn production movement. The late autumn crop planting area expanded from 5,100 mu before the drought to 13,000 mu, ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the annual grain production plan of 32 million jin.
　　The Dengjiatang Commune's late autumn planting plan before the drought was 5,100 mu, but with the rapid occurrence and development of the drought, the drought-affected area of paddy fields quickly reached more than 5,000 mu, accounting for more than 11% of the total field area, and the drought was even more serious for more than 9,000 mu of dry land crops. Faced with this situation, most cadres and the masses were energetic and full of drive, determined to overcome the drought, expand the planting area of late autumn crops, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's grain production plan. However, among some cadres, there was a sense of fear of difficulty, relaxation, and a passive waiting mentality of "relying on heaven for food."
　　The commune party committee believed that this was a very harmful right-leaning sentiment; people with this sentiment exaggerated the difficulties in their work, ignored the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, and especially did not see that doing a good job in production and increasing grain production was the most urgent requirement of the broad masses of commune members. The commune party committee then organized the masses to speak out and debate "whether or not to expand autumn planting" and "whether or not it is possible to expand autumn planting." During the debate, the commune members believed that expanding autumn planting certainly had difficulties, but the favorable conditions were the more important aspect. They calculated the specific favorable conditions: first, there was labor. The entire commune had a total of 13,000 rated laborers. As long as reasonable arrangements were made, 7,000 laborers could be drawn into the autumn planting movement; second, there was land. This is a semi-mountainous and semi-hilly area, and there is more land that can be utilized. Early rice fields and some early and mid-season rice fields can be replanted, many vacant spaces in front of and behind houses can be utilized, and a large number of mountain slopes can be reclaimed; third, this year is fifteen to twenty days earlier than last year, which can ensure that autumn crops have a sufficient growing season; fourth, the masses have a habit of autumn planting; fifth, the problems of fertilizer and seeds can be solved as long as the work is done well.
　　Through debate, laying out favorable conditions, the cadres with right-leaning conservative sentiments received a profound education, and the production enthusiasm of the cadres and masses quickly surged. The late autumn planting plan was expanded from the original 5,100 mu to 13,000 mu, and a vigorous late autumn production movement was launched throughout the commune. More than ninety cadres above the brigade level went deep into the forefront of production, eating, living, and laboring with the commune members, taking the lead in working hard, and discovering and solving problems in a timely manner. In order to plant one sprout and have it live, each brigade launched a dry land drought resistance movement while combating drought in paddy fields. They adopted methods of opening ditches to divert water and digging wells to draw water. Where there was no water source, they adopted the method of covering each mound with thatch after planting. The survival rate of corn planted by the Shangchong Brigade was low at the beginning. They soaked the corn seeds in urine water for an afternoon in advance, and then planted them in the soil at night, watering them with urine water every other day. In this way, the 217 mu of corn that was planted sprouted tender shoots in less than ten days.

　　经过一场辩论　认清有利条件
　　邓家塘公社掀起晚秋丰产热潮
    本报长沙17日电　湖南省郴县邓家塘人民公社通过对于部分干部右倾保守思想的批判，很快掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的晚秋丰产运动。晚秋作物播种面积由受旱前的五千一百亩扩大到一万三千亩，保证完成和超额完成全年三千二百万斤的粮食生产计划。
    邓家塘公社受旱前的晚秋播种计划是五千一百亩，但随着干旱的迅速发生和发展，水田受旱面积很快达到五千多亩，占总田亩的11％多，九千多亩旱土作物受旱更严重。面临着这个情况，大部分干部、群众精神奋发，干劲十足，决心战胜干旱，扩大晚秋作物播种面积，保证完成和超额完成今年粮食生产计划。但是，在一部分干部中，产生了一种畏难、松劲情绪和“靠天吃饭”的消极等待思想。
    公社党委认为这是一种非常有害的右倾情绪；有这种情绪的人，过分夸大了工作中的困难，忽视了克服困难的有利条件，特别是没有看到搞好生产、增产粮食，是广大社员群众最迫切的要求。公社党委接着组织群众鸣放辩论“要不要扩大秋种”、“可不可以扩大秋种”。辩论中，社员们认为扩大秋种，当然有困难，但有利条件是更主要的一方面。他们算了算具体的有利条件：第一，有劳力。全公社共有一万三千个评级劳力。只要进行合理的安排，可以抽出七千劳力投入秋种运动；第二，有土地，这里是一个半山半丘陵的地方，可以利用的土地较多，早稻田和部分早、中稻田可以复种，很多屋前屋后的空闲隙地可以利用，大量的山坡可以开垦；第三，今年比去年提早季节十五至二十天，可以保证秋种作物有足够的生长期；第四，群众有秋种习惯；第五，肥料、种子问题，只要做好工作就可以解决。
    通过辩论，摆出有利条件，有右倾保守情绪的干部受到了深刻的教育，干部、群众的生产热情迅速高涨，晚秋播种计划由原来的五千一百亩扩大到了一万三千亩，一个轰轰烈烈的晚秋丰产运动就在全公社范围内开展起来了。九十多个大队以上的干部都深入到生产的最前线，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动，带头大干，及时发现问题解决问题。为了做到种一兜活一兜，各个大队在水田抗旱的同时，开展了旱土抗旱运动，他们采取了开沟引水，打井吊水的办法。没有水源的地方，就采用种一丘用茅草盖一丘的办法。上冲大队包谷开始种下去成活率低，他们就事先把包谷种用尿水浸一下午，晚上再种到土中，每隔一天就浇尿水一次。这样，二百一十七亩包谷种下去不到十天，就都长出了青嫩的芽子。
