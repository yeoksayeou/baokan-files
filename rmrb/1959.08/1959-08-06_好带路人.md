    Good Pathfinders
    The Communist Party members of the Yunjin Team branch are truly good pathfinders. When the Party's policies are disseminated, they carefully listen to the voices of the commune members; when encountering difficulties in their work, they take on the most difficult tasks and leave the easy work to others; they care about the commune members' living difficulties even more than their own. The commune members also regard them as their own relatives.
    What the Party members of this team do—listening to and reflecting the opinions of the commune members, producing together with the commune members, visiting the commune members when they are sick, and so on—may seem ordinary, but in fact, they are doing a great cause related to the revolution and are truly the pioneers of the people.
    What do the commune members see in these Party members? They see their fearless spirit: they trample their personal interests under their feet and don't even look at them; they hold the interests of the Party and the masses tightly and never let go at any time. For the sake of the Party's interests and the masses' interests, they think thoughtfully, do things meticulously, are very capable, and work very hard, meticulously, and every move penetrates into the hearts of the commune members. The commune members feel the power and light of the Party from them, just like seeing the sun from a ray of light. The commune members follow them with full confidence, heading straight towards our ideal paradise.

    好带路人
    云锦队支部的党员，真是好带路人。党的政策下来了，他们细心地听社员的声音；工作中遇到困难，挑最难的干，把轻巧的活留给别人；社员有什么生活困难，看得比自己的还重要。社员们也把他们看成自己的亲人。
    这个队的党员所做的事情——听取和反映社员的意见，同社员一起生产，去看看社员的病，等等，看来好像很平凡，其实，他们干的是有关革命的大业，真正是人民的先锋。
    社员从这些党员身上看到了什么呢？看到了他们那种大无畏的精神：他们把个人的私利踩在脚下，看也不看；把党和群众的利益抱得紧紧的，任何时候也不放松。为了党的利益，为了群众的利益，他们想得周到，做得很细致，很能干，很努力，一丝不苟，一举一动深入社员的心。社员从他们身上感觉到党的力量和光明，就像从一道光线看太阳一样。社员满怀信心地跟着他们，一直走向我们理想的乐园。
