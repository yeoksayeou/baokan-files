Zhejiang and Sichuan Provincial Party Committees Demand Swift Action from All Regions, No Time to be Lost

Hangzhou, August 14th (Report from this newspaper) – The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a Standing Committee meeting and a telephone conference of all prefectural, municipal, and county Party committee secretaries. The meeting called for all levels of Party committees throughout the province to boost their drive even further, elevate their ambition to strive for the top, fully mobilize the initiative of cadres and the masses, overcome the negative and fearful sentiments of some cadres and masses, and seize the crucial months of August and September, to unleash an even greater upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy.

The meeting analyzed the current favorable situation in all aspects of production and work in the province. The early rice harvest was abundant across the province, and production was relatively balanced; most industrial enterprises increased production compared to last year. In terms of finance and trade, the market situation in June and July improved significantly. The meeting called on all regions to continue to exert their efforts, prevent complacency, seize August and September, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully to strive for continued great leaps forward this year. The meeting pointed out that August and September are crucial for the entire year, and August is the key to August and September. This opportunity must not be missed under any circumstances.

In rural areas, the Provincial Party Committee requires all levels of Party committees to firmly grasp grain production, strengthen the cultivation and management of late autumn crops, and actively develop diversified operations. The Provincial Party Committee requires all regions to thoroughly summarize the experience of early rice bumper harvests, carry out the movement of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, and launch mass-based hook-up competitions in order to apply the production experience of early rice to late rice, strive for late rice to surpass early rice, and achieve a full-year surpassing of contracted production targets. The Provincial Party Committee calls on cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels to go deep into production teams and small teams, deep into the fields, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, to help research and solve specific problems. The Provincial Party Committee has decided to increase new forces to continue the major inspection of summer agricultural production throughout the province.

In terms of industrial production, the Provincial Party Committee requires all regions to do everything possible to carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to comprehensively overfulfill all targets. In terms of financial and trade work, the Provincial Party Committee requires grasping the inspection of market conditions in cities and towns, and specifically arrange the next step of work.

Currently, most prefectural and county Party committees are studying how to implement the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. Some prefectural and county Party committees have already taken swift action.

Chengdu, August 14th (Report from this newspaper) – Party organizations and all cadres at all levels in Sichuan Province, according to the arrangements of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, are conscientiously studying the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Practice Increasing Production and Practicing Economy," and using this to arm themselves, taking measures in light of actual conditions, boosting greater efforts, and pushing industrial and agricultural production to a greater upsurge.

In July, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued a notice requiring Party committees at all levels to immediately arrange and organize all cadres in institutions, organizations, factories, mines, transportation, commerce and trade enterprises, and rural people's communes to conscientiously study the People's Daily editorial and resolutely overcome right-leaning slackening sentiments. The notice requires all systems and industries to conduct inspections in conjunction with the work of their departments, take swift action, carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and resolutely ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the province's national economic plan for this year.

At present, the industrial leadership departments of Sichuan Province have already made arrangements for vigorously grasping August and September and launching a greater upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy. They demand that pig iron, gray coke, transportation, as well as machinery, electricity, chemical industry, and light industry production achieve a greater leap forward in quantity and quality; at the same time, industry and transportation must better undertake the enormous tasks of supporting agricultural production, ensuring agricultural harvest, and guaranteeing market supply in the second half of the year. The industrial leadership departments believe that August and September in the third quarter are a critical moment. All enterprises and factories must urgently mobilize, continue to vigorously engage in competition, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully to ensure the realization of the leap forward plans for the third quarter and the second half of the year.

In the province's sixteen special districts and autonomous prefectures, the study movement has spread to grassroots Party organizations and grassroots cadres. The Jiangjin Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of county, district, and commune Party committee secretaries, summarizing the district's historical experience in fighting drought and achieving bumper harvests, powerfully criticizing the slackening sentiments and right-leaning sentiments of exaggerating difficulties that have grown in some cadres. After the meeting, the people of the entire district were urgently mobilized to further launch the drought resistance struggle. In Yongchuan County, 130,000 laborers irrigated 100,900 mu of drought-stricken rice seedlings in one day. The Wenjiang Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the current agricultural production situation, urgently mobilized all counties to immediately grasp five measures: first, continue to firmly grasp the work of rushing to plant and rush to sow; second, do a good job in autumn field management; third, vigorously engage in accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer; fourth, actively do all the preparations for the autumn harvest; fifth, vigorously develop diversified operations.

　　全力组织八九两月生产高潮
　　浙江四川省委要求各地迅速行动不能错失时机
    本报杭州14日电　中共浙江省委最近召开了常委会议和全省地、市、县委书记电话会议，要求全省各级党委把干劲鼓得更足，把力争上游的志气提得更高，充分调动干部群众的积极性，克服某些干部和群众的消极畏难情绪，抓紧8、9两月这个全年的关键，掀起增产节约更大的高潮。
  会议分析了当前全省各项生产和工作的有利形势，全省早稻获得大丰收，而且生产比较平衡；工业企业大部分比去年增产，财贸方面，6、7月份市场情况有很大的好转。会议要求各地继续鼓足干劲，防止产生松劲情绪，抓紧8、9两月，苦干、实干、巧干，争取今年继续大跃进。会议指出，8、9两月是全年的关键，8月份又是8、9两月的关键，这个时机无论如何不能错失。
    在农村方面，省委要求各级党委当前紧紧抓住粮食生产，加强晚秋作物的培育管理，同时积极开展多种经营。省委要求各地很好地总结早稻丰产经验，开展学先进、比先进、赶先进运动，发起群众性的挂钩竞赛，以便把早稻的生产经验用到晚稻上去，争取晚稻超早稻，全年超包产。省委号召省、地、县干部深入到生产队、小队，深入田间，苦干实干巧干，帮助研究和具体解决问题。省委决定增加新的力量，继续对全省夏季农业生产进行大检查。
    在工业生产方面，省委要求各地千方百计开展增产节约运动，为全面超额完成各项指标而努力。财贸工作方面，省委要求抓紧检查市、镇的市场情况，具体安排下一步工作。
    现在，全省大部分地委、县委正在研究如何贯彻执行省委的指示。有些地委、县委已迅速行动起来。
    本报成都14日电四川省各级党组织和全体干部，根据四川省委的布置，认真学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，并以此武装自己，结合实际情况采取措施，鼓足更大干劲，把工农业生产推向更大的高潮。
    四川省委7月发出通知，要求各级党委立即布置和组织所有机关、团体、厂矿、交通、商贸等企业和农村人民公社干部，认真学习人民日报的社论，坚决克服右倾松劲情绪。通知要求各系统、各行业结合本部门的工作进行检查，迅速采取行动，开展增产节约运动，坚决保证完成和超额完成本省今年的国民经济计划。
    目前，四川省工业领导部门已经对大抓8、9两月，掀起增产节约更大高潮的工作作了部署。要求生铁、灰焦、交通运输以及机械、电力、化工、轻工业生产在数量、质量上有一个更大的跃进；同时工业、交通运输在下半年要更好地担负起支援农业生产、保证农业丰收和市场供应的巨大任务。工业领导部门认为，第三季度的8、9两月是一个关键性的时刻，各企业各厂矿必须紧急动员起来，继续大搞竞赛，苦干、实干、巧干，保证实现第三季度和下半年的跃进计划。
    在全省十六个专区、自治州，学习运动已普及到基层党组织和基层干部中。中共江津地委召开了县、区、公社党委书记电话会议，总结了全区历年抗击干旱、获得丰收的经验，有力地批判了部分干部中滋长着的松劲情绪和夸大困难的右倾情绪。会后，全区人民紧急动员起来进一步展开了抗旱斗争。永川县十三万劳动大军一天内就浇灌了受旱禾苗十万零九千亩。中共温江地委研究了当前农业生产情况，紧急动员各县立即抓紧五项措施，首先继续抓紧抢栽抢种工作，其次搞好秋田管理，第三，大搞积肥造肥，第四，积极做好秋收的一切准备工作，第五，大力发展多种经营。
