    Universal Gas Welding and Cutting Machine
    In the past, the No. 1 workshop of the Beijing Metal Structure Factory could only cut circles, arcs, and rectangles using gas welding and cutting. Recently, the Zhang Zhifang group successfully trial-produced a universal gas welding and cutting machine, which can cut various shapes of flange plates according to the template, and no forging is required after cutting.

    万能汽焊切割机
    北京市金属结构厂一车间过去作汽焊切割，只能切圆、弧、长形，最近张志芳小组试制成功一种万能汽焊切割机，它能依照样板切割各种不同形状的法蓝牌，而且切割以后不需要锻工加工。
