    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Bangkok: SEATO Secretary-General Nai Pote Sarasin brazenly stated on the 2nd that this aggressive military bloc would take interventionist action in the Laotian situation.
    In a conversation with the Thai press, Nai Pote slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for “aggression” against Laos. He said that because Laos is within SEATO's "protection zone," SEATO is "watching the situation" in Laos with concern. Nai Pote provocatively stated that if the situation worsens and the Laotian government requests "assistance" from SEATO, SEATO will immediately convene a meeting of its eight member states to discuss effective actions to safeguard "peace" in the region.
    According to Bangkok newspapers, sources close to the Thai government have revealed that the Thai government is currently expressing major "concern" over the alleged "aggression" against Laos. Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat has ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant parties to pay attention to the development of the situation in Laos. Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman also made similar slanders and threats against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in his statement to the press on the 1st.

    东南亚集团秘书长大叫大嚷 
    要对老挝局势进行干涉
    新华社3日讯　曼谷消息：东南亚条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信在2日公然表示这个侵略军事集团要对老挝局势采取干涉行动。
    乃朴在向泰国报界发表谈话时，诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝。他说，由于老挝是处在东南亚条约组织的“保护范围”内，因此，东南亚条约组织“正关切地注视着”老挝的局势。乃朴挑衅地说，如果局势更加恶化，而老挝政府要求东南亚条约组织给予“援助”，东南亚条约组织将立即召开八个会员国会议，来商讨采取有效行动，以便维护这个地区的“和平”。
    据曼谷报纸报道，接近泰国官方的人士透露，泰国政府目前对老挝的所谓被“侵略”，表示重大的“关切”。泰国总理乃沙立已命令外交部和有关方面注意老挝局势的发展。泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼1日向报界发表谈话时，也同样地诬蔑和威胁越南民主共和国。
