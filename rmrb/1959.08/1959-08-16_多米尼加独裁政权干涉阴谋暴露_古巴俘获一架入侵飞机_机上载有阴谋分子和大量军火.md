Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 14th: The Cuban government announced today that Cuban military police seized a transport plane that invaded from the Dominican Republic on the evening of the 13th, capturing all the invaders and weapons and ammunition on board.

The invading C-46 transport plane carried a group of personnel and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition for the conspirators. Among the ten invaders on the plane were former Batista officers and a Spanish mercenary.

When the plane landed at Trinidad Airport in Las Villas Province, it immediately fell into a pre-arranged Cuban encirclement. The invaders attempted to start the plane's engines and take off to escape, but were immediately shot at by Cuban military police. In the brief battle, former Batista Lieutenant Colonel Soto, who was piloting the plane, and another officer were killed. The rest were captured alive.

The captured invaders confessed that they received military training in the Dominican Republic and were ordered by the Trujillo government to invade Cuban territory.

The Cuban government issued an announcement condemning the invasion launched by the Trujillo dictatorship and announced that it had thus smashed "an international conspiracy and counter-revolutionary activity in which Trujillo had actively participated."

The Cuban newspaper "Revolución" published a commentary stating that this proves "no invader can escape Cuba."

News from Santiago, Chile, the site of the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference, stated that the news of Cuba's capture of an invading aircraft immediately caused a strong reaction there. People believe that this incident proves the Dominican dictatorship's open intervention in the Cuban revolution and further confirms the arguments made by Cuba and Venezuela at the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    多米尼加独裁政权干涉阴谋暴露
    古巴俘获一架入侵飞机
    机上载有阴谋分子和大量军火
    新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴政府今天宣布，古巴军警在13日晚上缴获了一架从多米尼加入侵的运输机，飞机上的入侵者及武器弹药全部被俘获。
    这架入侵的C—46型运输机为阴谋分子载运了一批人员和大量武器弹药。在飞机上的十名入侵者中间，有前巴蒂斯塔军官及一名西班牙雇佣军。
    当这架飞机在拉斯维利亚斯省的特立尼达机场降落时，马上陷入了古巴预先布置的包围圈，入侵者试图发动飞机的马达起飞逃跑，但是立刻遭到了古巴军警的枪击。在短暂的战斗中，驾驶飞机的前巴蒂斯塔军官索托中校及另一名军官被打死。其余均被生俘。
    被俘的入侵者供认，他们在多米尼加受到军事训练，并且是特鲁希略政府命令他们侵入古巴领土的。
    古巴政府发表的公告谴责特鲁希略独裁政权发动的入侵，并且宣布至此粉碎了“一场国际阴谋和特鲁希略曾经积极参加的反革命勾当。”
    古巴“革命报”发表评论说，这证明“任何侵略者都休想逃出古巴”。
    从美洲外长会议所在地智利的圣地亚哥传来的消息说，古巴俘获一架入侵飞机的消息立刻在那里引起了强烈的反应，人们认为：这件事证明了多米尼加独裁政权对古巴革命的公开干涉，并且更加证实了古巴和委内瑞拉在外长会议上的论点。
