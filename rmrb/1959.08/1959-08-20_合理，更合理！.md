　　Reasonable, More Reasonable!
　　Shu Jia
      "Rationalizing the production process, saving labor and increasing efficiency is praised by everyone; taking fewer detours and doing more work, planting close to home and tapping great potential." This is the praise of the members of the Jiade People's Commune in Linfen County, Shanxi, for the rationalization of the production process.

    Rationalizing the production process is indeed worthy of praise. It can change some of the unreasonable phenomena in the production process left over from the past small-scale peasant economy, fully utilize the favorable conditions of the large collective, and run basic construction and production facilities that are conducive to the development of production but unattainable by small collectives. In this way, it can save more labor, improve labor productivity, and further promote the development of productive forces.

    In the past, restricted by the production methods of the small-scale peasant economy, people had to travel over mountains and rivers to plant distant fields, and had to detour when going to the fields outside the village, and water was visible south of the ditch but could not be used to irrigate the north... These were unreasonable things; however, at that time, people could only endure this unreasonableness. After agricultural cooperativization, the power of small collectives was much greater than that of the individual economy, and many unreasonable phenomena in the production process were properly resolved. However, under the limitations of the small collective production method and the limitations of manpower and material resources, the division of cultivated areas, the development and utilization of water conservancy, the allocation of diversified operations, etc., still could not be completely rational. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the limitations of small collectives were broken through again. With the communization and the improvement of people's awareness, the problems between this commune and that commune are also easily resolved through consultation. Under such conditions, it is more possible to make the best use of people's talents, make the best use of things, and make the best use of land. Rationalizing the production process can be realized on a larger scale and to a greater extent. The most important purpose of establishing the People's Commune is to make the production process more reasonable. Further realizing the rationalization of the production process is also one of the most important manifestations of the superiority of the People's Commune.

    The superiority of the People's Commune was already apparent in its early stages. However, the People's Commune is a new organizational form, and its superiority cannot be fully apparent to people all at once; some are still potential. These potential forces, with the increasing perfection and consolidation of the commune system, with the cadres' increasing experience in leading large collective production, and with the commune members' increasing familiarity and habituation with the commune system, will inevitably be more apparent. The rationalization of the production process of the Jiade People's Commune occurred under the increasingly consolidated People's Commune. The existing rationalization activities are just a beginning, and the production rationalization movement will inevitably be carried forward!

　　合理，更合理！

      “生产过程合理化，省工效高人人夸；少走冤路多做活，远地近种潜力大。”这是山西临汾县贾得人民公社社员对生产过程合理化的赞扬。
    生产过程合理化，的确值得赞扬。它可以改变过去小农经济所遗留下来的某些生产过程中的不合理现象，充分利用大集体的有利条件，兴办有利于发展生产而为小集体所办不到的基本建设和生产设施。这样，就可以更多节省劳动力、提高劳动生产率、促进生产力进一步发展。
    过去，人们受着小农经济生产方式的限制，不得不跋山涉水种远地，出村种地不得不绕道而去拐道而回，眼看沟南有水沟北却浇不上……这些是不合理的事情；可是，在当时，人们只能忍受这种不合理。农业合作化以后，小集体的力量较个体经济的力量要大得多，生产过程中的许多不合理的现象得到了适当的解决。但是，在小集体生产方式的限制和人力物力的限制下，耕作区的划分，水利的开发和利用、多种经营的配置等等，仍然不能做到完全合理。人民公社成立以后，小集体的局限性又被突破了。随着公社化和人们觉悟的提高，这个公社和那个公社之间的问题也容易协商解决了。在这样的条件下，更有可能做到人尽其才、物尽其用、地尽其利，生产过程合理化也就能够在更大范围内、更大程度上实现。办人民公社最主要目的，正是为了使生产过程更加合理。进一步实现生产过程合理化，也正是人民公社优越性的一个最重要的表现。
    人民公社的优越性，在它建立的初期就已经显现出来了。但是，人民公社是一种新的组织形式，它的优越性还不能一下子就完全显现在人们的眼前，有些还是潜在的。这些潜在的力量，随着公社制度的日益健全和巩固，随着干部领导大集体生产的经验愈来愈多，随着社员群众对公社制度愈来愈熟悉、愈来愈习惯，就必然会更多地显现出来。贾得人民公社的生产过程合理化，就是在人民公社日益巩固的情况下出现的。现有的合理化的活动，只不过是个开始，生产合理化运动必将日益发扬光大！
