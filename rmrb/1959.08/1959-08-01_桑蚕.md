Small Knowledge

    Silkworm
    Silkworm silk is a special product of China. Compared with other countries in the world, China's silkworm silk production is only lower than Japan, ranking second in the world.
    China's silkworms are distributed in twenty-four provinces (regions) and cities, nearly a thousand counties. Among them, the provinces with more breeding and larger output are: Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong. New silkworm areas opened up after liberation include: Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces.
      Spring, Summer, and Autumn Silkworms
    Spring, summer, and autumn silkworms are distinguished by the breeding season. Those raised in the spring are called spring silkworms, those raised in the summer are called summer silkworms, and those raised after July are called autumn silkworms.
      Unusual Units of Measurement
    Silkworms are calculated by the number of silkworm eggs for breeding. The unit of silkworm eggs is "sheet" (some are packed in boxes). The specifications of silkworm eggs vary from place to place. Generally, each sheet weighs about ten to twelve grams and can hatch 16,000 to 18,000 ant silkworms. Raising silkworms from one sheet of eggs can generally yield about 50 jin of cocoons, and some can yield more than 100 jin.
    Comprehensive Utilization of Silkworms and Mulberry Trees
    Mulberry trees feed silkworms, and silkworms produce silk. This is only a major use of mulberry trees and silkworms. If a comprehensive utilization method is used, silkworm droppings can be used to make activated carbon, silkworm pupae can be refined into pupa oil to replace lubricating oil and valuable western medicine tyrosine, and cocoon scraps can be used to make artificial wool, sericin and serine.
    Mulberry trees also have many uses. The mulberry bark on the cut mulberry branches can be used to make white and soft artificial cotton; the paper pulp made from mulberry bark is better than paper pulp made from other raw materials; mulberry fruit can be used to brew mulberry liqueur, 60-proof white wine and alcohol; mulberry poles can also be used to replace bamboo or rattan to weave various utensils. According to the experience of Deqing, Zhejiang, due to comprehensive utilization, the total output value of one mu of mulberry land that produces 1,000 jin of leaves and raises silkworms to produce 100 jin of cocoons can be increased tenfold compared to the value of cocoon production.

    桑蚕
    桑蚕丝是我国的特产。和世界各国比较，我国桑蚕丝的产量仅低于日本，居世界第二位。
    我国桑蚕分布在二十四个省（区）、市，近一千多个县。其中饲养较多，产量较大的是：浙江、江苏、四川、广东。解放以后新开辟的桑蚕区有：黑龙江、辽宁、吉林、河北、江西、福建等省。
      春、夏、秋蚕
    春、夏、秋蚕是以饲养季节来区分的。春季养的叫春蚕，夏季养的叫夏蚕，7月以后养的叫秋蚕。
      不一般的计量单位
    桑蚕是以蚕种来计算饲养数量的，蚕种的单位是“张”（也有以盒盛装的）。各地桑蚕种的规格不同，一般每张约重十到十二公分，能孵化蚁蚕一万六千到一万八千个。养一张蚕种的蚕，一般可得茧五十斤左右，高的一百多斤。
    蚕、桑的综合利用
    桑养蚕，蚕产丝，这仅是桑和蚕的一项主要用途。如果用综合利用的办法，蚕粪可以制活性炭，蚕蛹可以提炼代替润滑油的蛹油和贵重西药酪氨酸，茧衣可以制人造羊毛、丝胶和丝氨酸。
    桑的用处也很多。刈下的桑枝上的桑皮能制出洁白柔软的人造棉；利用桑皮制的纸浆，比其它原料制的纸浆好；桑果可以酿桑果露酒、六十度白酒和酒精；桑杆还可以代替毛竹或藤编制各种用具。据浙江德清的经验，由于综合利用，一亩亩产千斤叶、养蚕产百斤茧的桑地的总产值，可比产茧价值增加十倍。
