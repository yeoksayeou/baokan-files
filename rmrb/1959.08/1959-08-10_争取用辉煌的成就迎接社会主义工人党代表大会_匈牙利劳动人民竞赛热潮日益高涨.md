    Strive to Greet the Socialist Workers' Party Congress with Brilliant Achievements
    The Labor Emulation Upsurge of the Hungarian Working People is Rising

    Our newspaper, Budapest, 9th dispatch: The labor emulation campaign launched by the Hungarian working people to greet the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Congress, which will be held in November this year, has achieved remarkable results. Workers and staff in various regions are actively and victoriously completing their tasks of offering gifts.

    Machine Tool Industry Workers are Highly Motivated
    Production has Reached the 1960 Level

    After the Party Central Committee issued a call in March to accelerate socialist construction, the workers and staff of the national machine tool industry department, in order to meet the needs of domestic industry and foreign trade, decided to provide an additional 27 million forints (Hungarian currency) worth of products beyond the annual plan and increase labor productivity from the originally planned 4.5% to 7%. In the months since the launch of the labor emulation campaign, the workers and staff of the machine tool industry department have provided 13 million forints worth of products beyond the plan, and labor productivity has increased by 8%. This means that machine tool industrial production has reached the 1960 level stipulated in the Three-Year Plan.

    These achievements are due to the hard work and ingenuity of the workers and staff of the machine tool industry department, who have adopted a series of measures to increase production and conserve resources. Nearly 30 kinds of machine parts are now produced using precision casting, and economical corrosion methods are used instead of planing. Collaboration in various production links has been improved. For example, assembly workshops can receive the required machine parts two weeks in advance, and parts are painted before assembly, eliminating the need to disassemble the machine for painting after assembly. Workers and staff have also put forward various rationalization proposals to improve production technology and working methods.

    Metallurgical Industry Department Increases Steel Production
    Successfully Completes Gift-Giving Tasks Month After Month

    The workers and staff of the metallurgical industry department have also successfully completed the gift-giving tasks of the labor emulation campaign month after month. The workers of the Lenin Metallurgical Joint Factory and the Ozd Steel Joint Factory proposed to produce 8,000 tons of pig iron more than planned in the first half of the year. Thanks to their efforts, they produced 8,500 tons more. The Martin furnace workers of the Lenin Metallurgical Joint Factory decided to produce 35,000 tons of steel more than planned for the whole year, and they have already produced 21,000 tons more. They have also decided to increase production by 7,000 tons of steel in addition to completing the original annual gift-giving task.

    Due to the launch of the labor emulation campaign, the production of the Csepel Steel Plant in the first half of the year increased by 8.5% compared with last year, labor productivity increased by 5.8%, and the quality of products has also been significantly improved. More than 800 labor teams engaged in the competition are constantly improving production day by day.

    After successfully completing the gift-giving tasks in the first half of the year, the workers and staff of the Borsodnádasd steel plate rolling plant have now decided to use the raw materials saved in the second half of the year to increase the production of steel plates worth 2.7 million forints.

    Railway Department Workers Fight for Half a Year
    Overfulfilled Transportation of More Than 500,000 Tons of Goods

    The workers and staff of the Red Star Tractor Factory originally planned to increase the production of 150 tractors this year to support agricultural cooperatives, and now they have decided to increase the production of 30 more tractors and 2 million forints worth of parts.

    By the end of July, the workers and staff of the chemical industry department had also completed the gift-giving tasks month by month, and many units will overfulfill their proposed gift-giving tasks by the end of the year.

    Construction workers have also conscientiously practiced their promises. Up to now, the Komló Construction Company in Baranya County has completed 112 houses one month ahead of schedule. The Baranya County Construction Company has completed 329 houses eighty days ahead of schedule.

    The railway department workers undertook the task of transporting 1 million tons of goods in excess and saving 130,000 tons of coal this year. In the first half of the year, they overfulfilled the transportation of 550,000 tons of goods and saved nearly 120,000 tons of coal, which is an unprecedented achievement for the Hungarian railway department.

    Many State Farms Launch Competitions
    Yield per Unit Area Has Increased

    In order to welcome the convening of the Party Congress, 231 state farms across the country have put forward gift-giving tasks. They will increase production and save a total of 204 million forints worth of agricultural products. Since the launch of the competition between state farms, many previously backward units have become advanced farms. For example, the average yield of 614 hold of wheat recently harvested by the Tiszavárkony-Köcsey farm was 16.5 quintals, while the average yield per hold in the previous five years was only 10.4 quintals. Other crops on this farm are also growing well. Livestock products have also increased.

    The date of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Congress is approaching day by day, and the upsurge of labor emulation is also rising. The working people of the whole country are making their best efforts to greet the Party Congress with brilliant labor achievements.

    争取用辉煌的成就迎接社会主义工人党代表大会
    匈牙利劳动人民竞赛热潮日益高涨
    本报布达佩斯9日电　匈牙利劳动人民为了迎接将在今年11月间召开的匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会而展开的劳动竞赛，已取得了显著的成绩，各地职工都在积极地胜利地完成着他们提出的献礼任务。
    机床工业部门职工干劲大
    生产已经到达1960年水平
    全国机床工业部门的职工们，在3月党中央提出加速社会主义建设的号召后，为满足国内工业和对外贸易的需要，决定全年超计划多提供两千七百万福林（匈币）的产品，把劳动生产率从原订的增加4.5％提高到7％。展开劳动竞赛的几个月来，机床工业部门的职工们已超计划提供了一千三百万福林的产品，劳动生产率已提高了8％。这就是说，机床工业生产已达到三年计划规定的1960年的水平。
    这些成绩的取得是由于机床工业部门的职工们发挥干劲，开动脑筋，采取了一系列增产节约的措施。近三十种机器零件的生产，采用了精密铸造法，用经济的腐蚀法代替了刨削法。改进了各生产环节的协作，如装配车间在两周以前便可收到所需要的机器零件，在装配前便给零件上漆，这样就不需要在机器装配好后再拆开油漆。职工们并纷纷提出了各种各样的合理化建议，改进了生产技术和劳动方法。
    冶金工业部门增产钢铁
    月月胜利完成献礼任务
    冶金工业部门的职工们也按月胜利地完成了劳动竞赛的献礼任务。列宁冶金联合厂和奥兹德钢铁联合工厂的职工，提出上半年要超计划多生产八千吨生铁，由于他们的努力，结果多生产了八千五百吨。列宁冶金联合厂的马丁炉工人决定全年超计划多生产三万五千吨钢，现在已超计划多生产了两万一千吨。他们又决定除完成原来已提出的全年献礼任务外，还要增产七千吨钢。
    切佩尔钢铁厂由于开展了劳动竞赛，上半年的生产比去年提高了8.5％，劳动生产率提高5.8％，产品质量也有了显著的改良。现在八百多个开展竞赛的劳动队正在逐日不断地提高生产。
    包尔绍纳达日德钢板轧制厂的职工们，在胜利完成上半年的献礼任务后，现在又决定要在下半年用节约下来的原料增产价值二百七十万福林的钢板。
    铁路部门职工奋战半年
    超额运输五十多万吨货
    红星拖拉机厂的职工原定今年增产一百五十台拖拉机支援农业合作社，现在又决定再增产三十台拖拉机和二百万福林的零件。
    到7月底止，化学工业部门的职工们也按月完成了献礼任务，很多单位在年底将超额完成他们提出的献礼任务。
    建筑工人们也认真实践了自己的诺言。到现在为止，贝奇州的柯姆洛建筑公司提前一个月完成了一百一十二所住宅。巴腊尼阿州建筑公司已提前八十天建成了三百二十九所住宅。
    铁道部门的职工今年承担了超额运输一百万吨货物，节约煤十三万吨的任务。上半年他们已超额运输了五十五万吨货，节约了近十二万吨煤，这是匈牙利铁道部门从未有过的优良成绩。
    许多国营农场开展竞赛
    单位面积产量有了提高
    为了迎接党代会的召开，全国已有二百三十一个国营农场提出了献礼任务。他们共将增产节约二亿零四百万福林的农产品。自从国营农场之间展开竞赛以来，很多过去落后的单位已变成了先进农场。例如，提萨夫雷德—科契农场最近收割的六百一十四霍尔特麦子的平均产量为十六点五公担，而前五年每霍尔特的平均产量只有十点四公担。这个农场的其他农作物也长得很好。畜产品也有了增加。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会召开的日期在一天天地接近，劳动竞赛的热潮也在日益高涨，全国劳动人民正在尽最大的努力，争取以辉煌的劳动成绩来迎接党代表大会。
