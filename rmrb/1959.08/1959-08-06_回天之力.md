As we edit the news from various places about the people uniting to overcome the drought, before us appears a magnificent panorama of thousands upon thousands of people throwing themselves into the struggle against the drought. Residents, workers, teachers, and students of towns and cities rush to the drought-stricken fields; commune members from areas not threatened by drought hurry to areas where the drought is severe; on the industrial, commercial, transportation, and other fronts, people are also striving to support the front lines of the drought resistance struggle, each with high morale. People have only one goal, one belief: to overcome the drought and ensure a good harvest!

In the face of nature, any isolated individual is powerless. This is an important reason why farmers in old China were helpless in the face of natural disasters. The great collective, organized under the leadership of the Party, can, like a giant with the power to avert disaster, seize a good harvest from floods and droughts. The great collaboration between collectives makes the power even greater. It is precisely under the power of the collective that the disasters in drought-stricken areas have been mitigated; it is precisely after strengthening collaboration that the progress in drought resistance in areas with slow progress has accelerated. At present, the struggle against drought remains an arduous task, but as long as we are united and work together, we will surely win a great victory in this struggle.

    回天之力
    当我们编辑着各地人民齐心协力、战胜干旱的消息的时候，在我们面前仿佛出现了一幅幅千千万万群众奋身投入抗旱斗争的雄伟的图景。城镇的居民、职工、教师、学生奔向干旱的田野；没有受到干旱威胁的地区的社员急忙赶到干旱严重的地区去；在工业、商业、运输等等战线上，人们也在奋力支援抗旱斗争的最前线，个个斗志昂扬。人们只有一个目标，一个信念：战胜干旱，确保丰收！
    在大自然面前，任何孤孤单单的人都是没有力量的。这就是旧中国农民在天灾打击之下束手无策的重要原因。在党的领导下组织起来的巨大的集体，就能像有回天之力的巨人一样，从洪水、干旱中夺取丰收。集体和集体之间大协作，力量就更大了。正是在集体的力量下，旱象重的地区灾害减轻了；正是在加强了协作之后，抗旱进度迟缓的地区速度加快了。目前，抗旱斗争仍然是个艰巨的任务，但是，只要万众一心，齐心协力，在这场斗争中一定能获得伟大的胜利。
