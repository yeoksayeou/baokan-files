    Urban and Rural Areas Cooperate to Eradicate Diseases
    Zhejiang Launches Summer and Autumn Patriotic Health Campaign Centered on Fertilizer Accumulation
    (Our Correspondent Tu Zhengfeng reports) Zhejiang Province is currently conducting a summer and autumn patriotic health campaign centered on fertilizer accumulation. At present, the people of the province's towns and cities, in conjunction with eliminating various summer diseases and ensuring the people's health, are excavating sludge from sewers, collecting various hides, hair, garbage, stove ash, human and animal excrement, and poultry manure, etc., to send to the countryside to support a bumper late autumn harvest.
    After Zhejiang launched the health and fertilizer accumulation campaign, it has achieved remarkable results. According to statistics for the first ten days of July, the cities and counties of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Yiwu, and Wuxing alone have accumulated more than 12 million dan of fertilizer, which are being continuously transported to the countryside. In the health and fertilizer accumulation campaign, various localities have adopted many methods to find fertilizer sources and eliminate breeding grounds for the four pests. For example, in the "one person, one dan of fertilizer" campaign in Shaoxing City, the people of the city made full use of the gaps in production in the early morning and evening to find fertilizer sources extensively, adopting methods such as digging (sewer mud), picking up (animal manure), shoveling (wall base mud), collecting (aquatic plants), burning (grass and wood ash), and twisting (pond mud) to accumulate fertilizer. In order to ensure that health and fertilizer accumulation and production are not hindered in Chengyang Town, Tonglu County, and to facilitate the reasonable allocation of labor by the leaders, the town's factories, mines, industrial and commercial enterprises, government agencies, schools, organizations, and residential areas were organized into eighty-eight health teams. They also summarized the health and fertilizer accumulation experiences commonly used by the masses, such as the "great relocation of a hundred items," regular cleaning, digging up fly pupae, clearing weeds and garbage, filling in pits and depressions, plugging holes, improving old toilets and livestock pens, managing manure, water pits, and market sanitation, as well as the "washing and sweeping" method, to thoroughly clean out all kinds of fertilizers inside and outside the houses, in front and behind the houses, and in every corner, and send them to the countryside regularly. In Jiaxing City, in the campaign to find and dig up fertilizer sources, the shops under the city's Food Service Center alone can accumulate more than ten kinds of fertilizer, such as barber's water, washing water, sewer mud, vegetable peels, fruit peels, leftover food, and human and animal excrement, totaling nearly 10,000 jin per day.
    In carrying out the summer and autumn patriotic health campaign centered on fertilizer accumulation, various localities also attach great importance to improving the quality of health and fertilizer accumulation work. In many towns and cities, in order to make the feces and garbage harmless, they generally carry out five to ten days of sealed fermentation and composting for sterilization treatment. For example, towns in the Jiaxing area use fertilizer pits, fertilizer storage ponds, and thousand-jin fertilizer storage depots to store fertilizer. After natural fermentation or drug sterilization, according to scientific analysis and determination, the killing rate of parasite eggs in feces and garbage can reach more than 90%, and the fertilizer effect can also be increased by 20% to one time compared to the original.
    The health and fertilizer accumulation campaign has made the relationship between urban and rural people closer. Now people's communes and urban government agencies, factories, mines, enterprises and schools have contracts for the supply of manure.

    城乡配合进剿病害 
    浙江以积肥为中心开展夏秋季卫生运动
    本报讯　记者屠正峰报道：浙江省正在开展以积肥为中心的夏秋季爱国卫生运动。目前全省城镇人民结合消灭各种夏令疾病，保证人民身体健康的卫生工作，挖掘阴沟污泥，搜集各种皮子、毛发、垃圾、炉灰、人粪尿和家畜家禽粪等，送往农村支援晚秋作物大丰收。
    浙江开展卫生积肥运动后，已取得显著成绩。据7月上旬十天统计，仅杭州、绍兴、宁波、温州、义乌、吴兴等二十九个市县城镇，已积起一千二百多万担肥料，陆续运往农村。在卫生积肥运动中，各地采用许多方法来寻找肥源，消灭四害孳生场所。例如绍兴市在开展一人一担肥的运动中，全市人民利用早晚生产空隙，广找肥源，采取挖（阴沟泥）、拾（畜粪）、铲（墙脚泥）、捞（水草）、烧（草木灰）、捻（塘泥）的办法积肥。桐卢县城阳镇为了做到卫生积肥、生产两不误，便于领导合理安排劳力，将全镇厂矿、工商企业、机关、学校、团体和居民区编成八十八个卫生小组。并总结了群众惯用的百物大搬家、定期大扫除、挖掘蝇蛹、清除杂草和垃圾、填平坑、洼地、堵塞穴洞、改良旧厕所、牲畜栏、管理粪便、水坑、市场卫生等卫生积肥经验，和洗扫大翻身的办法，把室内外，屋前屋后，角角落落，各种各样的肥料经过反复的突击彻底地清除出来，定期送往农村。嘉兴市在大找大挖肥源中，仅市饮食服务中心店所属门市部，每天可以积蓄的理发水、洗涤水、阴沟泥、菜皮、果皮、残羹剩菜、人畜禽粪尿肥等十多种，近一万斤。
    在开展以积肥为中心的夏秋季爱国卫生运动中，各地还十分重视提高卫生积肥工作的质量。许多城镇在卫生积肥中，为了使粪便和垃圾经过无害化处理，一般都进行了五天至十天的密封发酵和堆肥杀菌处理。如嘉兴地区城镇用化肥坑、贮肥潭和千斤贮肥库贮存肥料，经过自然发酵或药物杀菌后，据科学分析测定：粪便和垃圾中的寄生虫卵杀伤率可达90％以上，肥效也能比原来提高20％至一倍。
    卫生积肥运动，使城乡人民的关系更密切了。现在人民公社和城镇机关、厂矿、企业和学校等订有粪便供应合同。
