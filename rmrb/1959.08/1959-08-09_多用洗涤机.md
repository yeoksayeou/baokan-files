Many foods, such as ginger, water chestnuts, potatoes, and sweet potatoes, need to be washed before processing. At present, many areas still use the old methods passed down from their ancestors, soaking the food to be washed in water and rubbing and trampling it by hand. One person works so hard all day that they can't straighten their back, and can only wash about six or seven hundred catties. If it is washing ginger, it is mostly in the cold winter days, both spicy and cold, the output is even less, and people are even more tired. Now, the Guangzhou Fruit and Food Processing Factory has created a "multi-purpose washing machine," which fundamentally changes this backward situation. Using this multi-purpose washing machine, one person can operate it and without their hands touching the water, and can wash about 25,000 catties of ginger a day.

This washing machine is simple to manufacture and use: use an iron pipe as an axle, and then use small bamboo or wooden strips to form a cylinder, with rifling inside, to make the machine body. In addition, build a water pool that is larger than the machine body, and immerse one-third of the machine body in the water. One end of the machine shaft is connected to the motor with a belt. When using it, just load the food to be washed into the machine body, turn on the motor, and the food will be rubbed against the small bamboo or wooden strips by the centrifugal force generated by the rotation of the machine body. The dirt on the food will be wiped off and rolled out of the outlet along the rifling. (Attached picture)

    多用洗涤机
    许多食品像生姜、荸荠、土豆、红薯等等，在加工前都得经过洗涤。目前，不少地区还是沿用祖辈相传的老法子，把要洗的食品泡在水里，手揉脚踩，一人一天累得驼子不伸腰，也只能洗六、七百斤上下。如果是洗生姜，多在数九寒天，又辣又冷，出活更少，人也更累。现在，广州市果子食品加工厂创制了“多用洗涤机”，从根本上改变了这种落后状况。用这种多用洗涤机，一人操作，手不沾水，一天就可以洗生姜二万五千斤左右。
    这种洗涤机制造和使用都很简便：用一根铁管做轴，再用小竹子或木条装成圆筒形，内安来复线，就做成了机身。另外，筑一个比机身大一些的水池，把机身的三分之一浸在水里。机轴一端用皮带与电动机相联。使用时，只要把要洗的食品装入机身，把电动机开动起来，食品就随着机身旋转所产生的离心力，同小竹子或木条相擦，食品上的泥垢就被擦掉，并顺着来复线从出料口滚了出来。（附图片）
