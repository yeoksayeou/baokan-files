　　Supporting Each Other in Adversity, Working Closely Together
　　The Autumn Fields of Zhao Brigade in Houchuan, Shou Zhang County, Rapidly Change Face Despite Drought
    This dispatch was transmitted from Jinan on the 14th of this month. The Zhao Brigade of Houchuan People's Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, in the struggle to resist drought and protect harvests, implemented large-scale cooperation based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, making drought resistance work both fast and good.
    This brigade is a relatively backward brigade in terms of water conservancy conditions. The brigade has eighteen small teams, with seven thousand eight hundred mu of land, of which only 13% is irrigated. After the wheat harvest, a drought appeared here, and only more than six hundred mu of the three thousand four hundred mu of wheat stubble land were planted in a timely manner, while the remaining fields could not be planted due to drought. The four thousand three hundred mu of spring seedlings were also threatened by drought. The Party General Branch Committee led the commune members to launch a drought resistance struggle, and by the end of June, more than one thousand mu of land had been watered. However, after the movement was launched, due to the different water conservancy conditions, labor, and tool conditions among the various small teams, and the different sizes of drought resistance tasks, an imbalance in drought resistance appeared. Among the eighteen small teams in the brigade, four small teams had better water conservancy conditions, with 50%-70% of the wheat stubble area watered and planted in a timely manner, while the remaining fourteen small teams had slower summer planting progress due to poor water conservancy conditions. This would inevitably lead to reduced production due to missed farming time. After recognizing this situation, the Party General Branch decided to carry out large-scale cooperation among the teams. First, seven hundred laborers were organized by seventeen small teams to dig six branch canals of more than twenty li in a concentrated effort, drawing Yellow River water from the main canal to irrigate the land, which could solve the problem of insufficient water conservancy for the entire brigade and expand the irrigated area by four thousand five hundred mu. Secondly, eight small teams with faster progress should assist six lagging small teams in doing a good job in drought resistance and seedling protection through consultation.
    After the Party General Branch put forward the task of cooperation, most cadres and commune members believed that more people meant more strength and agreed with this method; however, some cadres and commune members of some small teams did not agree. The cadres of the advanced teams were mainly afraid that drawing labor would affect the team's own production increase; the cadres of the lagging teams were afraid that the quality of cooperative farm work would not be good, and they would have to pay remuneration, which would reduce the team's income; the commune members were afraid of only cooperating without labor and without remuneration. In order to solve these ideological problems, the Party General Branch successively held meetings of small team cadres and commune members to discuss whether cooperation was good and how to carry out cooperation? In the discussion, the experiences and lessons of past large-scale cooperation were summarized. First, the benefits of mutual assistance and cooperation were affirmed. While affirming the benefits of cooperation, the shortcomings of excessive concentration of labor in last year's large-scale cooperation, which affected the production order of the small teams and failed to implement equivalent exchange, were also recognized. Therefore, everyone believed that as long as the method of cooperation was improved and the policy of equivalent mutual benefit was implemented, cooperation could be carried out well and promote the drought resistance movement. On the basis of unified understanding, the following methods were jointly negotiated: ① When the entire brigade cooperates or when small teams cooperate with each other, the number of laborers drawn for cooperation by each unit should not exceed 20% of the total labor force of the unit, so as not to affect the normal production procedures of the team; ② The cooperative parties must strictly implement the policy of equivalent mutual benefit; ③ When labor is cooperated, the quality requirements of the contracted quota must be followed, and the two parties must inspect and accept it. If the quality is not up to standard, it must be reworked.
    After the above methods were announced to the entire brigade, they were welcomed by all commune members, and cooperative activities were actively carried out. The six advanced small teams and the six lagging small teams also launched drought resistance cooperation through consultation. After the advanced Zhang Mingyue small team finished watering its own team's land, the deputy captain Liu Huaisheng personally led sixteen strong laborers, carrying eight waterwheels from his own team, to help the lagging Tian Daogang small team.
    Through cooperation, most of the brigade's spring crops and summer seedlings have been watered, changing the face of drought.

　　患难相扶　亲密协作
　　寿张后门赵大队秋田受旱面貌迅速改变
    本报济南14日电　山东寿张县打鱼陈公社后门赵大队在抗旱保收斗争中，在互助互利的原则下，实行大协作，使抗旱工作做得既快且好。
    这个大队是水利条件比较落后的队，全队十八个小队，七千八百亩地，水浇面积只占13％。麦收以后，这里就出现了干旱现象，三千四百多亩麦茬，只抢种了六百多亩，其余的田因干旱不能下种。四千三百多亩春苗，也遭干旱威胁。党总支委员会领导社员展开了抗旱斗争，到6月底浇地一千余亩。但是，在运动开展之后，由于各小队之间水利条件不同，劳力、工具条件不一，抗旱任务大小不同，因而出现了抗旱不平衡的现象。全队十八个小队中，有四个小队水利条件较好，水浇抢种麦茬面积50％—70％，而其余十四个小队因水利条件较差，夏种进度很慢。这样，势必造成因贻误农时而减产。党总支认清这一情况后，决定在各队之间开展大协作。首先由十七个小队组织七百名劳力，突击挖六条二十余华里的支渠，引干渠的黄河水浇地，这样可以解决全队水利不足的困难，扩大浇地面积四千五百亩。其次，再由八个进度快的小队，通过协商的办法，协助六个落后的小队搞好抗旱保苗。
    党总支提出协作任务后，大部分干部社员认为人多力量大，同意这种办法；但也有部分小队干部和社员不同意。先进队的干部主要是怕抽调劳力后影响本队增产；落后队的干部怕协作的农活质量不好，还得付给报酬，会使本队减少收入；社员们却怕光协作没有劳动没报酬。为了解决这些思想问题，党总支先后召开了小队干部和社员大会，让大家讨论协作好不好，怎样搞协作？在讨论中，总结了过去大协作的经验教训，首先肯定了互助协作的好处。在肯定协作好处的同时，也认识到去年大协作劳力过分集中，影响小队生产秩序和没有实行等价交换的缺点。因此，大家认为只要改进协作方法，贯彻执行等价互利政策，就能搞好协作促进抗旱运动。在统一认识的基础上，共同协商出了以下办法：①全大队协作时或小队与小队协作时，每个单位抽出协作的劳力不应超过本单位总劳力的20％，以免影响本队正常的生产程序；②协作双方必须严格执行等价互利政策；③劳力协作时，必须按照包工定额的质量要求，双方进行检查验收，不合乎质量的返工重做。
    上述办法在全队宣布后，受到了全体社员的欢迎，积极开展了协作活动。六个先进的小队和六个落后的小队也通过协商展开了抗旱协作。先进的张明月小队浇完自己小队的地后，由副队长刘怀升亲自带领十六名精壮劳力，携带本队的八部水车，帮助落后的田道岗小队。
    通过协作，全队春作物和夏苗绝大部分已经浇上了水，改变了干旱的面貌。
