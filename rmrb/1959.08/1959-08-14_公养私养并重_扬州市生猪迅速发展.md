Emphasizing Both Public and Private Raising
　　Yangzhou City's Pig Production Rapidly Develops
    (Reported by this newspaper) Pig production in Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, is developing rapidly. By the end of July, the number of pigs in pens reached 56,000 (of which 50.8% were publicly raised and 49.2% privately raised), an increase of more than 63% compared to the end of March. If we include the 9,100 heads supplied to the city and for commune members' consumption in the past four months, the actual number of pigs raised since the second quarter has increased by 90% compared to the first quarter.

    In accordance with the spirit of emphasizing both public and private raising, the Yangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first earnestly addressed the issue of remaining problems of pigs being converted into shares in the commune at a depreciated price; helped commune members solve the difficulty of obtaining piglets; allocated 5% of the total land area per capita to households as feed land, and the grain department also transferred a large number of water hyacinth seedlings from other places; pig manure was purchased by the team at prices based on quality; the Municipal Committee also stipulated that pig farmers could purchase more meat and oil after selling pigs.

    In terms of public raising, it was clarified that the communes and production brigades should mainly collectively raise boars and sows, and appropriately raise some strong pigs; production teams should raise a small number of boars and sows, and raise more strong pigs, for state purchase and collective consumption.

　　公养私养并重
　　扬州市生猪迅速发展
    本报讯　江苏扬州市生猪生产迅速发展。到7月底圈存量已达五万六千头（其中公养占50.8％，私养占49.2％），比3月底的圈存量增加了63％以上；如果连同过去四个月供应城市和社员自食的九千一百头，第二季度以来的实际养猪量比第一季度上升了90％。
    中共扬州市委根据公养私养并重的精神，首先是认真处理了生猪折价入社遗留的问题；帮助社员解决苗猪的困难；按照土地总面积划出5％按人分配到户作为饲料地，粮食部门还从外地调进大量水浮莲苗；猪粪肥由队按质论价收购；市委还规定养猪户出售猪以后可以多购肉、油。
    在公养方面，明确了公社、生产大队集体饲养的主要是种猪和母猪，适当饲养些壮猪；生产小队饲养少量种猪和母猪，较多的培育壮猪，以供国家收购和集体食用。
