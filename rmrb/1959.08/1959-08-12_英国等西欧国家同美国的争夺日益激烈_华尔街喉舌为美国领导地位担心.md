　　Competition Intensifies Between Britain, Other Western European Countries, and the United States
　　Wall Street Mouthpiece Worried About U.S. Leadership
　　This newspaper reports that a recent report in "U.S. News & World Report" listed the figures for U.S. foreign "aid" and investment since the end of the war, boasting that the economic recovery and development of its allies should be attributed to U.S. "generosity." Since 1946, the United States has injected $297.9 billion into the capitalist world through "government aid," "private aid," and private investment, of which private investment exceeded $27 billion. "U.S. News & World Report" boasted that this large sum of dollars had achieved the "result" of making its allies "strong and prosperous."
　　However, "U.S. News & World Report" had to worry that "some countries that were on the verge of collapse ten years ago are now competing with the United States for leadership in many markets around the world." Britain has "gained a firm foothold in this fiercely competitive world," France is "no longer asking for U.S. aid"; more seriously, "West Germany, which was once a scene of broken walls and ruins ten years ago, is now also closely following U.S. industry in competing in the world market." In general, "Western Europe has today begun to become an opponent of the United States in industry," "many countries that have received U.S. aid are strengthening trade barriers against U.S. goods," and "the once hard and proud dollar is now being sold at a discount when converted into certain foreign currencies."
　　"U.S. News & World Report" finally asked with the dissatisfaction of a benefactor: "Has the U.S. desire to help others reached a point where it may be harming itself?"

　　This newspaper reports that "U.S. News & World Report" published an article on August 10 entitled "Where is Britain Going?" On the one hand, it felt uneasy about whether the British were gradually leaving the United States and moving towards neutrality, and on the other hand, it contemptuously said that the British could only "act as America's number one errand boy."
　　The author of the article said that "there is a strong sentiment among some groups in Britain calling for a 'neutral' stance between the United States and Soviet Russia." The fact is: Britain is demanding a summit meeting; "British-Soviet trade is also surprising"; Britain believes that it is necessary to stop the arms race by implementing disarmament and "isolation" in Central Europe in accordance with the trend of the "reality of life" in today's world, and so on. Therefore, the author believes that "without strong U.S. leadership (referring to control and pressure), Britain would be expected to actively promote its own ideas and policies."
　　However, the article said, "Under strong pressure from the United States, the British often revise or suspend their own policies," and "the cornerstone of British foreign policy will continue to be the alliance with the United States." The article deliberately asserted that the British believe that acting as America's number one errand boy "will continue to bring considerable benefits," although the author is well aware that British politicians and newspapers have recently emphasized that Britain should play a leading role in the capitalist world, and this trend and rhetoric has repeatedly aroused dissatisfaction and criticism from Washington officials and American newspapers.

### 英国等西欧国家同美国的争夺日益激烈　华尔街喉舌为美国领导地位担心

　　英国等西欧国家同美国的争夺日益激烈
　　华尔街喉舌为美国领导地位担心
    本报讯　“美国新闻与世界报道”在最近的一篇道报中，列举了美国在战后以来对外“援助”和投资数字，夸耀它的盟国的经济恢复和发展应该归功于美国的“慷慨”。自1946年以来，美国通过“政府援助”、“私人援助”和私人投资的方式，向资本主义世界注入了二千九百七十九亿美元，其中私人投资达二百七十亿美元以上。“美国新闻与世界报道”吹嘘说，这一大笔美元取得了使它的盟国“强大和繁荣”的“成果”。
    不过，“美国新闻与世界报道”不得不忧心忡忡地说，“十年前尚处于崩溃边缘的一些国家，今天却在同美国争夺世界上许多市场中的领导地位。”英国已经“在这个竞争激烈的世界上站稳了脚”，法国也“不再要求美国的援助”；更严重的是，“十年前一片断墙颓垣的西德现在在竞争世界市场方面也正在对美国工业步步紧逼”。总的说来，“西欧今天在工业上已开始成为美国的敌手”，“许多接受美国援助的国家正在加强对美国商品的贸易壁垒”，而“一度是世界上最硬的、可以自豪的美元，现在在兑换某些外国货币时正在贴现出售”。
      “美国新闻与世界报道”最后带着恩主的不满口吻问道：“美国的帮助他人的愿望是否已达到可能自受其害的程度？”
    本报讯　“美国新闻与世界报道”8月10日发表一篇题为“英国往何处去”的文章，一方面对英国人是否要渐渐离开美国走向中立的问题感到不安，一方面又轻蔑地说英国人只能
  “充当美国的第一号小伙计”。
    文章的作者说，“在英国某些集团中存在着要求在美国和苏俄之间采取‘中立’立场的强烈情绪”。事实是：英国要求举行最高级会议；“英苏贸易也令人惊异”；英国认为有必要按照今天世界的“生活现实”的趋向，通过在中欧实行裁减军备和“隔离”来制止军备竞赛等等。因此，作者认为，“如果没有美国的坚强领导（指控制和压力），预料英国就能够积极推行它自己想出的主张和政策”。
    但是，文章说，“在美国的强大压力下，英国人又往往会修改或中止他们自己的政策”，“英国外交政策的基石将继续是同美国联盟”。文章别有用心地断言，英国人相信充当美国的第一号小伙计“会继续取得相当大的好处”，虽然作者十分清楚，英国政界人士和报纸最近大事强调英国要在资本主义世界中起领导作用，这种趋向和言论曾一再引起华盛顿官方和美国报纸的不满和抨击。
