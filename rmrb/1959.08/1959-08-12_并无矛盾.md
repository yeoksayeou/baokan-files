    There is No Contradiction

    The same "U.S. News & World Report" laments in one report that America's leadership is being challenged by its allies, while in another article it asserts that Britain can only be a junior partner to the United States. If even Britain cannot withstand American pressure, then what is there to fear from the challenge of allies? On the surface, these two statements are not without contradiction, but in reality, they are not.

    The question raised by the magazine in its report is: Will the United States harm itself by "aiding" its allies? And the question raised in the article is whether Britain will gradually leave the United States and move towards neutrality? These two questions are two in one and one in two, fully reflecting the anxiety of the Washington authorities. The difference lies in the conclusion; the former is more pessimistic, and the latter is more optimistic. However, even in the optimistic conclusion, the author of the article cannot but admit that Britain's centrifugal force is strong, and the several reasons for Britain's submission to the United States are also subject to change.

    The author of the report and the author of the article, in analyzing the alliance between the United States and its allies, both proceed from a position of strength: the former emphasizes the role of American "aid," and the latter emphasizes "America's enormous pressure." This is the foundation of the so-called "Western solidarity." But it is precisely this kind of foundation that is bound to disintegrate.

    Therefore, whether pessimistic or optimistic, it shows that the problem is serious. Just as America's Cold War policy is increasingly bankrupt, and it has to adopt some "flexible" approaches in East-West relations, but is afraid that this "flexibility" will melt the ice, the "Western solidarity" built on the "Cold War" will naturally become a matter of urgent concern for the American ruling class.

    并无矛盾
    同是“美国新闻与世界报道”，它在一篇报道里哀叹美国的领导权正在受到来自盟国的挑战，而在另一篇文章里又断言英国只能屈居美国小伙伴的地位。如果连英国都顶不住美国的压力，那又怕什么盟国的挑战呢？从表面上看，这两种说法不无矛盾，实则不然。
    这家杂志在报道里提出的问题是：美国会不会因为“援助”自己的盟国而反受其害？而在文章里提出的问题是英国是否要渐渐离开美国走向中立？这两个问题是二而一，一而二，都充分反映了华盛顿当局之焦虑所在。不同的是结论，对前一问题悲观一些，对后一问题乐观一些。然而，就在乐观的结论里，文章的作者也不能不承认英国的离心力是强烈的，英国屈从美国的几个原因也是会变化的。
    报道的作者和文章的作者在分析美国同它的盟国的联盟时，都是从实力地位出发的：前者强调美“援”的作用，后者强调“美国的巨大压力”。这就是所谓“西方团结”的基础。但正是这样的基础，是一定要分崩瓦解的。
    因此，不管是悲观的，还是乐观的，都说明问题是严重的。正在美国冷战政策日趋破产，不得不在东西方关系上采取一些“灵活”做法，但又害怕这种“灵活”会融解冰块的时候，建立在“冷战”上的“西方团结”，自然就要成为美国统治集团迫切关心的问题了。
