Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 18th: The Ministry of Light Industry recently held a National Experience Exchange Conference of Small Paper Mills in Zhengzhou. The conference called on all staff in the paper industry to continue to exert their utmost efforts, further promote the increase production and practice economy movement centered on high output, high quality, low consumption, and safety, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national production plan.

The conference pointed out that this year is a year of continued great leap forward for the paper industry. The paper output in the first half of the year increased by 32% compared with the same period last year; the work of small paper mills has also achieved remarkable results on the basis of last year. At present, there are 718 small paper machines that have been built and test-run to produce paper, with a designed daily production capacity of 701 tons. Many provinces, counties, and cities have developed small-scale paper industries, changing the past situation where they could not produce machine-made paper, and effectively supporting the needs of general cultural paper in various places. Taking Zhengzhou City as an example, the glazed paper produced by small paper mills accounts for 50% of the market sales.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's national production plan for small paper mills, the conference proposed that small paper mills should strive to implement the policy of rectification, consolidation, and improvement. All paper mills with relatively normal production must reach and break through their design capacity as soon as possible; factories that are test-running paper should quickly take measures to strive for normal production; paper mills that meet the construction conditions should resolutely and quickly build them and put them into production as soon as possible; those whose construction conditions are not yet met should be postponed in order to concentrate efforts, vigorously grasp production, and promote small paper mills to gradually achieve high output, high quality, low consumption, and safe production.

　　发展小型造纸工业
　　少用原料　多产好纸
　　全国小型纸厂经验交流会议提出奋斗目标
    据新华社郑州18日电　轻工业部最近在郑州召开的全国小型纸厂经验交流会议上，要求造纸工业的全体职工继续鼓足干劲，进一步开展以高产、优质、低消耗和安全为中心的增产节约运动，努力完成和超额完成今年的国家生产计划。
    会议指出，今年造纸工业是继续大跃进的一年。上半年的纸张产量比去年同期增长了32％；小型造纸厂的工作在去年的基础上也取得了显著的成绩，目前全国已经建成试车出纸的小型纸机有七百一十八台，设计日产能力共七百零一吨。许多省、县、市因为发展了小型造纸工业，改变了过去不能生产机制纸的局面，有力地支援了各地一般文化用纸的需要。以郑州市为例，小型纸厂生产的有光纸就占市场销售量的50％。
    为了保证完成今年小型纸厂的国家生产计划，会议提出小型纸厂应当努力贯彻整顿、巩固和提高的方针。凡是生产比较正常的纸厂，必须尽快地达到和突破设计能力；正在试车出纸的厂子，要迅速采取措施，力争正常生产；具备建成条件的纸厂，要坚决迅速的建成，尽快投入生产；建厂条件还不具备的，应该缓办，以便集中力量，大抓生产，促进小型纸厂逐步实现高产、优质、低消耗和安全生产。
