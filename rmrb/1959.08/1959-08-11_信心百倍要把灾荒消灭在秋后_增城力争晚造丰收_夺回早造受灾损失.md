　　Guangzhou, August 10th (From Our Newspaper) – The people of the disaster area in Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, are full of confidence in eliminating disaster and famine after the autumn harvest. After the rapid restoration of production and life order, a production self-salvation movement striving for a bumper late rice crop and recovering the losses from the early rice crop disaster has vigorously unfolded in this area.

　　Zengcheng County suffered a flood disaster more than a month ago, and the losses were severe. Out of the county's 600,000 mu of early rice, more than 280,000 mu were flooded, and more than 110,000 mu were completely lost. More than 50,000 mu of economic crops and miscellaneous grains were also submerged. Most of the large and small dikes along the river were breached by the flood, and the houses of more than 60,000 disaster victims were washed away. However, under the strong leadership of the Party and with strong support from all sides, in just over a month, the people in the disaster area rapidly restored production and life order. Now, the food supply for the disaster victims has been effectively arranged. On average, each person receives about 25 jin of rice per month, and during the busy farming season, each laborer can generally eat about one jin of rice per day. Laborers engaged in heavy work (such as closing breaches and restoring dikes) can even eat about one and a half jin of rice. In addition, they have planted more than 20,000 mu of early-maturing miscellaneous grain crops as a supplement to food rations and feed. The disaster victims whose houses collapsed have also been quickly resettled.

　　With the rapid restoration of production and life order, the confidence of the people in the disaster area in production self-salvation has also greatly strengthened. In order to achieve a bumper late rice crop and recover the losses from the early rice crop disaster, the county's late rice planting area is prepared to be expanded to 750,000 mu, which is 150,000 mu more than the early rice. Now, all the late rice seeds have been sown, and plowing has been basically completed.

　　Zengcheng County is currently concentrating its labor force to rush-transplant late rice seedlings. Since July 27, more than 70,000 laborers have been put into rice transplanting every day. The cadres and masses are highly motivated and have strong confidence in late rice production. They believe that there are many favorable conditions for winning a bumper late rice harvest. First of all, the flood brought several inches of fertile mud to the flooded farmland. At the same time, the time for plowing and soaking the fields has also been greatly advanced. Now, if we concentrate our efforts to transplant the seedlings in time and strengthen management, the late rice will definitely have a bumper harvest. The expanded area of 150,000 mu alone can bring back the rice lost in the early rice crop.

　　Zengcheng County plans to repair and build a batch of houses after the late rice is transplanted, and repair all the collapsed houses from after the autumn harvest to around the Spring Festival next year. Now, 100,000 pieces of timber have been prepared, and more than 400 lime kilns have also resumed production, having already produced more than 110,000 dan of lime. There are also plans to burn a large amount of bricks and tiles. The style and color of the houses are also being studied with experts sent from Guangzhou.

### 信心百倍要把灾荒消灭在秋后　增城力争晚造丰收　夺回早造受灾损失

　　信心百倍要把灾荒消灭在秋后
　　增城力争晚造丰收
　　夺回早造受灾损失
    本报广州10日电　广东省增城县灾区人民对于把灾荒消灭在秋后充满了信心。在生产和生活秩序迅速恢复后，一个力争晚造大丰收、夺回早造受灾损失的生产自救运动，已经在这个地区蓬勃展开。
    增城县在一个多月前遭受了洪水灾害，损失是严重的。全县的六十万亩早稻，有二十八万多亩受淹，十一万多亩完全失收。经济作物和杂粮被浸死的，也有五万多亩。沿江大小堤围，大部分被洪水冲崩，还有六万多灾民的房子被洪水冲塌。但是在党的坚强领导和各方面大力支持下，仅仅一个多月，灾区人民就把生产和生活秩序迅速恢复起来。现在，灾民的粮食供应已经有了切实的安排，大小口平均，每人每月约有二十五斤稻谷左右，农忙的时候，每个劳动力一天一般可以吃到一斤左右大米，其中干重活（如堵口复堤）的劳动力还可以吃到一斤半左右大米。此外，他们又种下了早熟杂粮作物二万多亩，作为口粮和饲料的补充。房子倒塌了的灾民，也迅速得到了安置。
    随着生产和生活秩序的迅速恢复，灾区人民对于生产自救的信心也大大加强。为了实现晚造的大丰收，夺回早造的受灾损失，全县的晚稻准备扩大到七十五万亩，即比早稻多种十五万亩。现在晚稻的种子已经全部播下去，犁田工作已经基本完成。
    增城县目前正集中劳动力抢插晚稻秧苗，从7月27日开始，每天投入插秧的劳动力达七万多人。干部群众的干劲很高，对晚造生产的信心很强。他们认为夺取晚造丰收有很多有利条件，首先是洪水给受淹区的农田带来了几寸厚的肥泥；同时，犁田和沤田的时间也大大提早了。现在集中力量及时把秧苗插下去，并加强管理，晚造就一定可以大丰收，单是那扩大的十五万亩面积，就可以把早造损失的稻谷拿回来。
    增城县准备在插完晚稻以后，修复和新造一批房屋，大秋后到明年春节前后，把全部倒塌的房子修复。现在已准备好十万条木材，四百多座石灰窑也恢复生产了，已烧出石灰十一万多担，砖瓦也计划大烧。房子的样式、颜色也正和广州派来的专家研究。
