　　Adding Equipment, Accumulating More Fine Fertilizer
　　Dingji Commune Vigorously Engages in Basic Fertilizer Accumulation Construction
    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) The Dingji People's Commune in Huaiyin City, Jiangsu Province, has launched a ten-point basic construction campaign for fertilizer accumulation among its members, achieving great results in the past twenty days. Many members said, "This move is right," and "Increased production will be more reliable in the future." The ten points of basic construction for fertilizer accumulation are: through adding and repairing, each household should have a pigsty, a chicken and duck pen, a toilet, a water manure pond, a urine collection jar, one or two chamber pots, a grass ash storage, a manure basket, a manure scoop, and a broom. The soil in this commune is barren, and the yield has been very low for many years. The commune has a total of 45,000 mu of cultivated land, of which 35,000 mu are saline-alkali land, truly "laborious land." After the basic solution of water conservancy and other problems, the amount and quality of fertilizer have become prominent issues for agricultural production increase. The broad masses of cadres and the masses know the principle of more fertilizer, more production. Since the great leap forward in agriculture, the amount of fertilizer accumulated has greatly increased, but due to insufficient attention to household fertilizer accumulation, relying solely on collective shock tactics and using digging, shoveling, and other methods to accumulate fertilizer, there is more coarse fertilizer, less fine fertilizer, and the quality is poor.
    Why hasn't household fertilizer accumulation been successful? After investigation and research, the main reason is the lack of fertilizer accumulation equipment and unclear compensation for fertilizer accumulation. In Pantan Brigade, out of 235 households, more than 100 households raising pigs do not have pens, more than 100 households do not have manure ponds, and many households do not even have toilets or chicken and duck pens, scattering fertilizer and being unsanitary. Some members even lack tools such as manure baskets, manure scoops, and brooms. Therefore, vigorously grasping the basic construction of household fertilizer accumulation for members has become the central issue of the fertilizer accumulation movement in this commune. The commune Party committee promptly proposed launching a ten-point basic construction campaign for fertilizer accumulation among its members. At the same time, fertilizer accumulation plans were formulated according to the fertilizer accumulation capacity of each household, and compensation was clarified, recording work points or pricing according to quality, delivering fertilizer quarterly, paying at the time of distribution, and rewarding over-fulfillment through public discussion. These measures and slogans were supported by the broad masses of members as soon as they were proposed. However, due to the lack of fertilizer accumulation tools and the need for bricks, tiles, and wood for repairing and building toilets and pigsties, some people were discouraged, and some cadres and masses believed that this approach in low-yield areas would only work if the higher authorities lent some money to support wood, bricks, and tiles. But by holding on-site meetings in two pilot teams, the fear of difficulties was quickly eliminated. Materials were based on "local materials, making the best of what is available," and the source of funds was "members relying on their own efforts, with appropriate leadership support." Many members raised and borrowed wood themselves, cut green grass to exchange for wheat straw for cattle to eat to build pigsties, and used corn stalks and hemp stalks to build fences for toilets. Two-thirds of the existing more than 3,000 manure baskets have been repaired by adding handles and patching bottoms. Some families did not buy a single new brick, and completely collected broken bricks to build water manure ponds. Pantan Brigade took out 10,000 yuan of sideline income to lend to households in difficulty as infrastructure funds, to be repaid at the time of distribution.
    Now this movement has achieved great results. The number of water manure ponds in the commune has increased from more than 3,600 to more than 4,500, and the number of toilets has increased from more than 2,800 to more than 4,200. The number of ash storages has increased from the original more than 170 to more than 3,900. Basically, every household has a water manure pond, toilet, manure basket, manure scoop, pigsty, chicken and duck pen, and ash storage. On average, every two households have a manure bucket, and every three households have two brooms and two shovels. In the past, each household could only accumulate five to six dan of fertilizer per month on average, one-third of which was fine fertilizer. Now each household can accumulate twelve dan per month, half of which is fine fertilizer. In total, the entire commune has accumulated 36,000 dan of fertilizer in the past twenty days, of which 27,000 dan have been used for late autumn topdressing. It is estimated that by the time of autumn sowing, members' self-accumulation, plus collective composting, green manure, bedding manure, etc., will reach 35 dan of base fertilizer per mu for 21,000 mu of autumn-sown land.
    Now the commune is strengthening leadership over this movement from beginning to end, and competition through visits and appraisals is also being carried out between teams. (Yang Xingkui)

### 增添设备　多积精肥　丁集公社大搞积肥基本建设

　　增添设备　多积精肥
　　丁集公社大搞积肥基本建设
    本报讯　江苏省淮阴市丁集人民公社在社员中普遍开展了积肥十项基本建设运动，二十天来取得成绩很大。很多社员说：“这步棋走得对”，“今后增产更有指靠”。积肥十项基本建设内容是：通过添置和整修，每户达到有一个猪圈、一个鸡鸭圈、一个厕所、一个水粪塘、一口积尿缸、一至两只马桶、一个草木灰库、一只粪箕、一把粪勺、一把扫帚。这个公社土质瘠薄，历年产量很低，全社共四万五千亩耕地，其中沙碱土地就有三万五千亩，是名符其实的“工本田”。在水利等问题基本解决之后，肥料多少和好不好，已是农业增产上突出的问题。多上肥多增产的道理，广大干部群众不是不知道的，农业大跃进以来，积肥量是大大增多了，可是由于对家庭积肥注意不够，单靠集体突击，用挖、铲等办法积肥，因此粗肥多，精肥少，质量差。
    家庭积肥为什么没有搞起来？经过调查研究，主要是积肥设备不全，积肥报酬没有明确。潘谈大队二百三十五户，有一百多户养猪没有圈，一百多户没有粪塘，不少人家还没有厕所，没有鸡鸭圈，既抛撒肥料，又不卫生。有些社员甚至连粪箕、粪勺、扫帚等工具也不齐全。所以大抓社员家庭积肥基本建设已成为这个公社积肥运动的中心问题。公社党委及时提出了在社员中开展积肥十项基本建设运动。同时，根据各户的积肥能力制订积肥计划，明确报酬，评记工分或按质论价，按季交肥，分配时付款，超额完成公议奖励。这些措施口号一提出就得到广大社员的拥护。但是由于积肥工具缺乏，修盖厕所、猪圈又需要砖瓦木料，这使得有些人泄气了，部分干部群众认为，低产地区这么搞法，除非上级借点钱，支持木料、砖瓦。但是通过在两个试点队召开现场会，很快地消除了畏难情绪。材料本着“就地取材，因陋就简”，经费来源是“社员自力更生、领导适当支持”。许多社员，自筹自借木料，割青草换牛吃的麦穰盖猪圈，用玉米秸秆，麻秆插起笆墙做厕所，现有的三千多个粪箕，有三分之二是经过添把补底修好的，有些人家不买一块新砖，完全筹积碎砖搞起了水粪塘。潘谈大队拿出副业收入一万元借给困难户作基建费，待分配时抵还。
    现在这个运动已经取得很大成绩。全社水粪塘从三千六百多个发展到四千五百多个，厕所从二千八百多个发展到四千二百多个。灰库从原来一百七十多个发展到三千九百多个。基本达到每户都有水粪塘、厕所、粪箕、粪勺、猪圈、鸡鸭圈、灰库，平均每两户已有一个粪桶，每三户有两把扫帚、两把锹铣。过去平均每户每月只能积肥五至六担，三分之一是精肥，现在每户每月能积十二担，半数是精肥。总计全公社二十天来已积肥三万六千担，已用于晚秋追肥二万七千担，预计到秋播时社员自积加上集体搞堆肥、绿肥、垫肥等，两万一千亩秋播土地每亩可达基肥三十五担。
    现在公社对这个运动正在自始至终加强领导，队与队之间还开展了参观评比竞赛运动。　（杨行揆）
