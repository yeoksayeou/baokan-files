Specifically Help Workers Solve Learning Difficulties
    Shenyang Textile Factory's Spare-Time School Gradually Consolidates
    (Our newspaper Shenyang, August 5th) Leaders of the Shenyang Textile Factory help workers overcome specific difficulties, enabling the factory's spare-time education to continuously develop. In recent months, the attendance rate of the factory's spare-time school has consistently remained at around 80%.
    The factory has more than 1,700 workers, of which female workers account for about 60%. These female workers are not only actively engaged in production, but also shoulder heavy housework. In the past, the factory's spare-time education was not regular enough, and some workers did not participate in learning. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the factory has elevated workers' spare-time education to its proper position, focusing on spare-time education while grasping production. However, many female workers had to manage household chores, and the daily life of children and adults also had to be taken care of. After eight hours of production, some production meetings were often held, so the enrollment rate of workers was not high, and the attendance rate fluctuated. The factory's Party committee considered the special circumstances of a large number of female workers. After many studies, it was finally decided that there would be four study days each week. On the four designated days, no meetings or other activities were allowed to be held during spare time. The Party committee would arrange central work and production meetings. If it was necessary to occupy spare time, it had to be approved by the factory-level leadership. This arrangement allowed most female workers to resolve the contradiction between studying and housework. However, among the one thousand or so female workers in the factory, some could not attend school because they were burdened with children. At that time, although the factory had a nursery and an elementary school for the children, which could help many workers solve the problem of managing and educating their children, the nursery only accepted children under three years old due to limited conditions. Children over seven years old could enter elementary school. There were still many children between the ages of four and six who had no way to be taken care of. After research, the factory decided to establish a new kindergarten, which was built using some of the dormitories vacated by the workers. Its facilities are simple. Currently, it has accepted more than 100 children between the ages of three and six. In the factory, there are also many couples who go to work and leave work together. Participating in learning extends the time to return home, and some housework cannot be handled in time. To help workers solve difficulties, the factory conducted meticulous adjustments. For example, Liu Liansheng, a spinning worker, and his wife, Li Lanying, have five children. After the two participated in learning, they could not arrange breakfast for the children the next day. Later, Liu Liansheng was transferred to Class A, and Li Lanying was transferred to Class B. When Liu Liansheng went to work at ten o'clock at night, Li Lanying led the children to sleep soundly at home, and she went to work after preparing breakfast the next morning. Soon, Liu Liansheng also came back, so there were always people taking care of the family, and it did not affect family reunion. They felt very satisfied.
    Since the factory leaders specifically helped the workers overcome difficulties in learning, the factory's spare-time education has significantly improved. Since March of this year, the enrollment rate has risen from 50% in the past to 80%, and the attendance rate has also been more stable.
    In addition, the knowledge that the workers have learned in the spare-time school has already played a role in production. For example, Wang Qingli, a cotton mixing worker, has mastered the calculation of cotton mixing with the help of learning and technicians. After calculating the percentage and then mixing the cotton, the product quality has been significantly improved.

### 具体帮助职工解决学习困难  沈阳纺织厂业余学校逐步巩固

    具体帮助职工解决学习困难
    沈阳纺织厂业余学校逐步巩固
    本报沈阳5日电　沈阳纺织厂领导上帮助职工克服具体困难，使职工业余教育不断获得发展。几个月来，工厂业余学校的出席率，经常保持在80％左右。
    这个厂共有一千七百多名职工，其中女职工约占60％。这些女职工一方面积极从事生产，另一方面肩负着繁重的家务。过去，工厂职工业余教育不够正常，有些职工没有参加学习。从去年大跃进以来，工厂把职工业余教育提到应有地位，在抓生产的同时大抓职工业余教育，但是有许多女职工要对家里的油盐柴米进行安置，孩子大人生活起居也必须照顾。而在八小时生产之后，还往往要开一些生产会议，所以职工入学率不高，出席率也忽高忽低。工厂党委考虑到大批女职工的特殊情况，经过多次研究，最后决定每周有四天是学习日，在规定四天的业余时间，不准开任何会议和作其他活动。关于中心工作、生产会议等活动由党委统一安排。必须占用业余时间时，要经过厂一级领导批准才能占用。这样安排，使大部分女职工都能解决学习和家务的矛盾。但是，在全厂一千来名女职工中，还有一部分女工由于孩子拖累而不能上学。当时，工厂虽然设有一座托儿所、一所子弟小学，可以帮助许多职工解决孩子的管理和教育问题，但托儿所因条件限制只接收三周岁以下的孩子。七周岁以上的孩子才能入小学。还有许多四岁至六岁的孩子，没有办法托管。工厂经过研究，决定新成立一座幼儿园，这座幼儿园是利用职工腾出来的一些宿舍修建起来的，它的设备简易。目前已接纳了一百多名三至六周岁的孩子。在工厂里，还有许多夫妻俩人一同上下班，参加学习后延长了回家时间，有些家事就来不及处理。为帮助职工解决困难，工厂进行了细致的调整工作。如细纱工人刘连生和妻子李兰英，家里有五个孩子，俩人参加学习后，孩子第二天的早饭没法安排，后来调刘连生在甲班，李兰英在乙班，当刘连生夜里十点钟上班后，李兰英在家领着孩子安稳地睡觉，第二天早晨把早饭预备好了她才上班，不久刘连生也回来了，这样家里既经常有人照顾，又不影响家庭团聚，他们感到很满意。
    自从工厂领导上具体帮助职工克服在学习上的困难之后，这个工厂的业余教育有了显著好转。从今年3月以来，入学率已从过去的50％上升到80％，而且出席率也较稳固。
    另外，职工们在业余学校里学习的知识，已经在生产上发挥了作用。如混棉工人王庆礼，经过学习和技术员的帮助，已经熟练地掌握了混棉的计算，通过百分比计算之后再去混棉，使产品质量有了显著的提高。
