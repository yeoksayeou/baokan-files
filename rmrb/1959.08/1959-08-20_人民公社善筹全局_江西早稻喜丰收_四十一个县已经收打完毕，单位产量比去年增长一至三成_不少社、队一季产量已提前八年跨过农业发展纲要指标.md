　　People's Communes Excellently Plan the Overall Situation
　　Jiangxi Achieves a Bumper Harvest of Early Rice
　　Forty-one Counties Have Completed Harvesting and Threshing, with Unit Yield Increasing by 10% to 30% Compared to Last Year
　　Many Communes and Teams Have Exceeded the Agricultural Development Program Targets Eight Years Ahead of Schedule
　　Nanchang, August 19th (Our Newspaper) – Jiangxi Province has achieved a widespread bumper harvest of early rice this year. According to statistics from forty-one counties in the Yichun, Shangrao, and other four special districts that have already completed harvesting and acceptance, the unit area yield of early rice this year generally increased by 10% to 30% compared to last year. Communes and production teams with large-scale, high-yield harvests are emerging everywhere.
　　This year's bumper harvest of early rice in Jiangxi has the following four characteristics: First, the vast majority of regions achieved even greater bumper harvests of early rice this year on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. For example, Pingxiang County, which won the Jiangxi Provincial Grain Production Red Flag last year, saw increased production in every plot of its 400,000 mu of early rice this year, with the unit area yield increasing by 20% compared to last year. Second, some historically low-yield areas and low-yielding fields have seen particularly significant increases in early rice production this year. The 100,000+ mu of red soil fields in Dongxiang County, traditionally low-yielding, reached a per-mu yield of over 100 jin last year. This year, the average per-mu yield of early rice leaped to 250 jin, more than doubling last year's yield. Third, many large-scale, high-yield fields of thousands or tens of thousands of mu have emerged all over the province. Fourth, many communes and production teams have exceeded the Agricultural Development Program targets eight years ahead of schedule with just one season of early rice this year, surpassing last year's total annual output. According to statistics from 28 communes in Pingxiang County, there are 60 production brigades with an average per-mu yield of 800 to 1,000 jin of early rice this year. In Suichuan County, over 40,000 mu of early rice (14% of the county's early rice area) exceeded the program's targets in one season, with over 35,000 mu averaging 815 jin per mu and 6,400 mu yielding 1,015 jin per mu.
　　The fact of Jiangxi's bumper harvest of early rice this year once again eloquently proves the great superiority of the people's communes. For example, Yihuang County is located in a remote mountainous area. Due to the small population and large land area, there was a shortage of labor, and the rate of production increase has been slow in past years. After communization last year, the county excavated more than 10,000 laborers by rationally allocating labor and running various collective welfare undertakings, so that every process of early rice production this year was done more carefully than in previous years. At the same time, thanks to the superiority of the people's communes in arranging and using manpower, material resources, and financial resources, the diversified management and sideline production of various communes have also developed rapidly, and commune-run industries have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The county has established more than 300 agricultural machinery factories, local fertilizer factories, pesticide factories, lime factories, etc., which strongly supported and promoted the development of agricultural production in terms of funds, fertilizers, and other material resources. Therefore, the total output and unit area yield of early rice in the county this year have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. Another example is the Dahuang People's Commune in Wannian County, which suffers from a severe water shortage. The commune members wanted to build a large reservoir at Diaotongzui to irrigate 10,000 mu of land a long time ago. However, to build such a large reservoir, not only would a large amount of labor be required, but also more than 1,700 mu of land and more than 2,000 mu of firewood forest would be submerged. This problem could not be solved from the elementary cooperative to the advanced cooperative. After communization last year, under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, the problems of submerged land and firewood forest were properly resolved, and a large number of laborers were transferred. After three months of hard work last winter, the large reservoir was built, and more than 20,000 mu of early rice in the whole commune have been free from drought and flood ever since. When early rice needed water for tillering this spring, although there was a prolonged drought without rain, the seedlings were not affected by the drought at all because there was a reservoir. The total grain output of the whole commune in one season of early rice this year exceeded the total grain output of the whole year last year by 16.7%.
　　After preliminary discussions and summaries by cadres and commune members in various places, everyone believes that the main experiences in achieving a bumper harvest of early rice this year are three: First, vigorously launch mass movements and carry out regular large-scale inspections, large-scale appraisals, and large-scale competitions. This is an important link in boosting the enthusiasm of the masses, promoting the development of production, and achieving a bumper harvest of early rice this year. Since the spring plowing and preparation work, the whole province has widely mobilized the masses by summarizing the achievements and experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward, and launched a vigorous movement to build water conservancy projects and accumulate and manufacture fertilizer. Later, spring plowing and production, field management, summer harvesting and summer planting, one climax after another, and production rose step by step. Especially in early June, a vigorous movement to achieve a thousand-jin bumper harvest of early rice was launched in various places, which further boosted the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses, who processed and fertilized early rice one after another, and carried out a concentrated effort to eliminate the third type of seedlings. The growth of rice seedlings improved day by day. Second, this year's bumper harvest of early rice is a great victory for the comprehensive and correct implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production increase. Last winter and this spring, various places firmly grasped water conservancy and fertilizer, and the whole province built more than 28,500 large and small water conservancy projects, expanding and improving the irrigation area by 7.5 million mu; and carried out three fertilizer accumulation movements in winter, spring, and summer, accumulating 18.2 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average application of more than 100 dan of fertilizer per mu of early rice. Deep plowing was done better than last year. The density of planting was more reasonable, basically achieving rational close planting according to local conditions. Field management was more meticulous, pest and disease prevention and control were carried out early, and eliminated in time after they occurred. The thorough implementation of various production increase measures has converged into the victory of the bumper harvest of early rice. Third, strengthening the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a bumper harvest of early rice. Throughout the entire early rice production process, the Party committees at all levels were headed by the first secretary, concentrating their efforts to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production. In particular, the Party committees at all levels paid attention to strengthening the leadership of backward communes and teams with weak economic foundations at the beginning of this year, which promoted a universal bumper harvest of early rice this year. For example, the Yichun Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred more than 2,400 cadres to serve as branch secretaries or other leading positions in backward teams; at the same time, the state and the commune gave strong economic assistance. In this way, under the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the state and the commune, 1,358 backward production teams in the whole region, after half a year of hard work, have had 825 backward teams approach or catch up with the level of advanced teams, and early rice has achieved a universal bumper harvest, with an average per-mu yield generally increasing by more than 40% compared to last year.
　　Encouraged by the bumper harvest of early rice, the broad masses of farmers in the province are now full of confidence in victory and are launching a vigorous new upsurge in autumn production with greater enthusiasm, determined to achieve the struggle goal of "late rice surpassing early rice and autumn harvest surpassing summer harvest."

　　人民公社善筹全局
　　江西早稻喜丰收
　　四十一个县已经收打完毕，单位产量比去年增长一至三成
　　不少社、队一季产量已提前八年跨过农业发展纲要指标
    本报南昌19日电　江西省各地今年早稻普遍获得大丰收。据宜春、上饶等四个专区已经收打验收完毕的四十一个县的统计，今年早稻的单位面积产量一般比去年增长10％到30％，大面积高额丰收的公社、生产队到处涌现。
    今年江西早稻大丰收有以下四个特点：一，绝大多数地区都是在去年大丰收的基础上取得了今年早稻的更大丰收。如去年曾获得江西全省粮食增产红旗的萍乡县，今年全县四十万亩早稻，丘丘增产，单位面积产量比去年增长了20％。二，一些历来低产的地区和低产田，今年早稻增产特别显著。东乡县的十万余亩红壤田，素来是低产田，去年早稻亩产达到一百多斤，今年早稻平均亩产跃升到二百五十斤，比去年翻了一番多。三，全省到处涌现出了许多千亩、万亩的大面积高额丰产田。四，不少的公社、生产队今年早稻一季的产量就提前八年跨过了农业发展纲要的指标，超过了去年全年总产量。据萍乡县二十八个公社的统计，今年早稻平均亩产八百斤到一千斤的生产大队有六十个。遂川县有四万多亩早稻（占全县早稻面积14％）一季跨过了纲要的指标，其中三万五千多亩平均亩产八百一十五斤，六千四百亩亩产一千零一十五斤。
    今年江西早稻大丰收的事实，又一次雄辩地证明了人民公社的巨大优越性。例如宜黄县位于偏僻的山区，由于人少田多，劳力不足，历年来增产速度较慢。去年公社化以后，全县通过合理调配劳动力和举办各种集体福利事业，挖掘出了劳动力一万多个，从而使今年早稻生产样样工夫比往年做得精细；同时，由于人民公社在安排和使用人力、物力、财力方面的优越性，各个公社的多种经营和副业生产也得到迅速的发展，社办工业像雨后春笋。全县已兴办了农具厂、土化肥厂、农药厂、石灰厂等三百多个，从资金、肥料以及其他物质资料方面有力地支援和促进了农业生产的发展。因此，今年全县早稻总产量和单位面积产量都比去年增产三成以上。又如万年县大黄人民公社，严重缺水，社员很早就想在吊桶嘴修个灌溉万亩的大水库。但是要建这样大的水库，不仅要大量的劳动力，还要淹没一千七百多亩土地和二千多亩柴山。这个问题从初级社到高级社一直无法解决。去年公社化以后，在公社党委的统一领导下，妥善解决了被淹土地和柴山问题，调了大批劳动力，经过去冬三个月的奋战，修成了这座大水库，全社二万多亩早稻从此旱涝无忧。当今春早稻发兜需水的时候，虽然久旱无雨，但因为有了水库，禾苗丝毫未受旱。全社今年早稻一季就超过去年全年粮食总产量的16.7％。
    经过各地干部和社员的初步座谈总结，大家认为今年早稻取得大丰收的主要经验有三条。一，大搞群众运动，开展经常性的大检查、大评比、大竞赛。这是鼓舞群众干劲，推动生产发展，取得今年早稻大丰收的重要一环。全省从春季备耕工作开始，就通过总结去年大跃进的成绩和经验，广泛地发动了群众，掀起了一个热火朝天的兴修水利、积肥造肥运动。以后春耕生产、田间管理、夏收夏种，高潮一个接着一个，生产步步上升。特别在6月初，各地开展了一个轰轰烈烈的大闹早稻千斤丰收运动，更加鼓足了广大干部和群众的干劲，纷纷为早稻加工加肥，突击进行消灭三类苗，禾苗生长日益改观。二，今年早稻大丰收是全面正确贯彻农业增产“八字宪法”的伟大胜利。去冬今春，各地狠狠抓住了水利和肥料，全省兴修了大小水利工程二万八千五百多座，扩大和改善了灌溉面积七百五十万亩；并在冬季、春季、夏季开展了三次积肥运动，积肥达一百八十二亿担，每亩早稻平均施肥一百多担。深耕比去年做得更好。密植规格更加合理，基本上做到了因地制宜、合理密植。田间管理抓得更加细致，病虫害防治得早，发生后扑灭及时。各项增产措施这样踏踏实实的贯彻执行，就汇成了早稻大丰收的胜利。三，加强了党的领导，这是早稻取得大丰收的根本保证。在整个早稻生产过程中，各级党委都由第一书记挂帅，集中力量，加强对农业生产的领导。特别是各级党委今年一开始就注意了加强对经济基础薄弱的落后社、队的领导，促使今年早稻取得了普遍大丰收。例如，中共宜春地委抽调了二千四百多名干部到落后队去担任支部书记或其他领导工作；同时，国家和公社在经济上又给予有力扶助。这样，全区一千三百五十八个落后生产队，在党的领导和国家、公社的扶助下，经过半年的苦战，已有八百二十五个落后队接近或赶上了先进队的水平，早稻普遍丰收，一般亩产都比去年增长了40％以上。
    由于早稻大丰收的鼓舞，目前全省广大农民群众满怀胜利信心，又以更大的干劲掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的新的秋季生产高潮，决心实现“晚稻超早稻、秋收超夏收”的奋斗目标。
