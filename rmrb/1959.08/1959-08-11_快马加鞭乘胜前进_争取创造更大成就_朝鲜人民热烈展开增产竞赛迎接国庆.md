Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 10th: Having achieved the great victory of a 75% increase in total industrial output value in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year, and completing the industrial output value plan of the First Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule, the Korean working people are now whipping the horse and advancing triumphantly, striving for greater production achievements to greet National Day and working to complete and overfulfill this year's plan.

　　Steelworkers Fight Bravely in the Scorching Heat
　　Good News of Increased Production Pour In
　　Korean steelworkers are fighting bravely in the face of rarely seen scorching heat to increase steel production. The workers of the Hwanghae Iron Works, using the former Japanese-era blast furnace with a daily output of 300 tons, which was restored and expanded last year, created a record of 850 tons per day in the first half of this year. Recently, they reported the good news of producing 950 tons of iron in one day. The steel rolling department of this factory produced more steel in the one year from the second half of last year to the first half of this year than the total amount of steel to be produced in 1961 as stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan. Now, the steel rolling workers are continuing to expand equipment, improve technical management, and will produce more steel in the second half of the year.
　　Machine Department Employees Are in High Spirits
　　Determined to Expand Equipment Through Self-Reliance
　　The movement of machine tool production by the machine departments employees is developing vigorously throughout North Korea like a prairie fire. Now, whether it is a machine factory or a repair shop in various parts of North Korea, wherever there are machine tools, they are building their own machine tools. In the first month of the second half of the year, July alone, factories in northern Korea produced more than 4,400 machine tools and simple machine tools in addition to the original plan. The workers are continuing to work hard, strengthen design, and improve the quality of machine tools. They will produce sixteen times more machine tools and simple machine tools this year than last year, greatly expanding North Korea's machine manufacturing capacity, expanding various production equipment with their own strength, especially manufacturing a large number of agricultural machines, and accelerating the mechanization of agriculture. Textile Workers Increase Cloth Production with Great Results: Two Days' Output Equals Entire Year Before Liberation
　　The Pyongyang Textile Factory, North Korea's largest textile industry base, overfulfilled the Five-Year Plan at the end of June and then completed the July production plan ahead of schedule on July 29. Now, the workers are fighting to reach a cloth production of 300,000 meters before the 14th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15." At present, textile factories in northern Korea can produce 650,000 meters of cloth every day. Now, they can weave the amount of cloth produced in the entire northern Korea in one year in 1944 in just two days.
　　Chollima Movement Widely Launched
　　Thousands of Work Teams Join the Competition
　　The "Chollima Work Team" movement initiated by Korean workers at the beginning of this year has been widely launched throughout northern Korea. Up to now, 997 work teams from various industrial sectors have joined this new type of socialist competition, and 33 work teams have won the title and flag of "Chollima Work Team." The Huang Dayuan Youth Work Team of the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Kim Chaek Iron Works, which recently won this title, has not only created outstanding achievements in increasing pig iron production, but has also done a good job in unity, mutual assistance, and improving technical and cultural levels.
　　The employees of the basic construction department in North Korea have also recently concentrated their efforts to speed up key projects. The builders of the newly built Sinuiju United Textile Factory have recently organized the "Chollima Shock Brigade" to work day and night to build a textile factory with 60,000 spindles before the "August 15" National Day. The newly built Guseong Machine Tool Factory will also be completed at this time. The two newly built 60-meter-long converters of the Chongjin Steel Plant will also be completed at this time and begin producing granular iron. (Attached picture)
　　North Korea's current textile production has increased eighty times compared with 1944 during the Japanese rule. This is the printing and dyeing workshop of the Pyongyang Textile United Enterprise, which has recently been mechanized.

    快马加鞭乘胜前进　争取创造更大成就
　　朝鲜人民热烈展开增产竞赛迎接国庆
    本报平壤10日电　朝鲜劳动人民在今年上半年取得了工业总产值比去年上半年增长75％，提前二年半完成第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划的伟大胜利，现在他们正快马加鞭，乘胜前进，以更大的增产成就来迎接国庆，并为完成和超额完成今年的计划而努力。
    钢铁工人冒暑奋战
    增产捷报纷至沓来
    朝鲜的钢铁工人正冒着历年少见的酷暑，为增产钢铁而战。黄海制铁所的工人用去年恢复扩建起来的解放前日产三百吨的高炉，在今年上半年创造了日产八百五十吨的纪录，最近又传来了一天生产九百五十吨铁的捷报。这个厂的轧钢部门在去年下半年到今年上半年的一年内，生产了比五年计划规定的1961年全年要生产的钢材还要多的钢材，超额完成了第一个五年计划，现在轧钢工人们在继续扩建设备，改善技术管理，要在下半年生产更多的钢材。
  机械部门职工意气风发
  决心自力更生扩大设备
    机械部门的职工掀起的机床生产机床的运动正以燎原之势在全国范围内猛烈发展。现在朝鲜北部各地无论是机械厂或是修配车间，凡是有机床的地方都在自造机床。仅在下半年的第一个月7月份内，朝鲜北部各厂就在原计划以外多生产了四千四百多台机床和简易机床，工人们正在继续努力，加强设计，提高机床的质量，要在今年以内生产等于去年的十六倍的机床和简易机床，大大地扩大朝鲜的机械制造能力，以自己的力量扩充各种生产设备，特别是大量制造农业机械，加速农业的机械化。纺织工人增产布匹成绩大两天产量等于解放前全年
    朝鲜最大的纺织工业基地——平壤纺织工厂在今年6月底超额完成了五年计划以后，又在7月29日提前完成了7月份的生产计划。现在工人们正为在“八一五”朝鲜解放十四周年纪念日前，使布匹的产量达到三十万米而奋战。目前朝鲜北部各纺织厂每天已能生产六十五万米布。现在只要两天就能织出1944年整个朝鲜北部一年生产的布匹。
  千里马运动广泛展开
  上千作业班投入竞赛
    朝鲜工人从今年年初发起的“千里马作业班”运动已在整个朝鲜北部广泛展开。到目前为止已有各个工业部门的九百九十七个作业班投入了这个新型的社会主义竞赛，并已有三十三个作业班荣获了“千里马作业班”的称号和旗子。最近获得这个称号的金策制铁所第一号高炉黄大渊青年作业班，不仅在增产生铁方面创造了优异的成绩，而且在团结互助，提高技术文化水平方面也作得很好。
    朝鲜基本建设部门的职工，最近也集中力量加快速度突击重点工程。新建的新义州联合纺织厂的建设者们最近组织了“千里马突击队”，日夜大战，要在“八一五”国庆前建成有六万纱锭的纺织厂。在这时竣工的还有新建的龟城机床厂。清津炼钢厂新建的两座长六十米的大转炉也将在这时落成，并开始生产粒铁。（附图片）
    朝鲜现在纺织品的产量，同日本统治时期1944年相比，增加到八十倍。这是最近改成机械化的平壤纺织联合企业的印染车间。
