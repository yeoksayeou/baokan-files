    "Four-化" Warehouse
    Zhao Kaixuan
    The Nanzhan District Warehouse is the largest comprehensive warehouse in Jiangxi Province, capable of storing approximately 19,000 tons of goods and regularly maintaining over 13,000 varieties of commodities. The warehouse experiences frequent material inflow and outflow. In the past, the loading, unloading, carrying, stacking, and offloading of goods here relied entirely on shoulder carrying and back hauling, resulting in high labor intensity and low work efficiency. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the warehouse storage volume has increased dramatically, and the original twenty-eight warehouse keepers were far from meeting the work needs. Facing the difficulties, they followed the direction pointed out by the Party, implemented the policy of "starting with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and continuously improving," and mobilized employees to carry out technological revolution and technological innovation movements, launching a tenacious battle to replace human labor with tools to improve work efficiency. Now, the employees of this warehouse have created more than 200 pieces of various cranes, elevators, conveyors, indigenous rails, indigenous telephones, slides, carts, aerial ropeways, maintenance instruments, communication equipment, cooking utensils, etc. Each warehouse has an average of more than two mechanical tools and more than two carts, and each warehouse keeper has an average of seven innovative tools, realizing a "Four-化" warehouse with mechanized transport by rail cars, semi-mechanized lifting, scientific commodity maintenance, and advanced handling technology.

    Now, this warehouse has built twelve indigenous rails, leading to every key warehouse, three of which are interconnected with railway sidings. Using railcar trains, the hardware team can easily carry 1,000 kilograms of goods per trip over a distance of 100 meters, equivalent to the labor of twenty people in the past. This warehouse has achieved carts in every warehouse and carts everywhere, all designed according to the characteristics of each warehouse's usage. For example, there is a "transportation cart" that can carry 3,000 kilograms and can travel on railway switches, allowing one person to distribute goods from the platform to various warehouses, increasing work efficiency by sixty times compared to the past. There is also a "universal tricycle" that can carry 200 kilograms, which is very agile and can travel freely on the ground, in cargo buildings, on wide or narrow aisles, or at right-angle turns.

    Commodity stacking and unstacking often require a large amount of labor. In the past, it always relied on manual operation, which was inefficient, unsafe, and wasted warehouse space. Now they have created the "Nanchang-style turning crane," which can lift 150 kilograms each time, raise it three meters, and rotate around to freely choose a cargo space. Two-hundred-kilogram iron drums of camphor oil could only be stacked in two layers by hand in the past. Now, with the "Nanchang-style turning crane," they can be stacked in three layers. The transportation and electrical warehouse's cargo building mainly stores radios and other shock-sensitive goods. In the past, one person could only carry two boxes at most per trip. Now, using the bicycle structural principle, they have made a "foot-operated loading and unloading conveyor," which can carry eleven boxes per trip and can safely reach the shelves directly with the conveyor up and down.

    In the past, quality inspection of commodities in this warehouse relied on sensory perception, which was labor-intensive, inefficient, and inaccurate. During the technological innovation movement, employees created and imitated many maintenance instruments and utensils. For example, according to the climatic characteristics of the southern region, warehouses storing large quantities of goods prone to mildew are equipped with "electric temperature and humidity reporting devices" and "automatic switching doors and windows." These devices can help warehouse keepers promptly understand and adjust the temperature and humidity changes inside the warehouse. For commodities prone to insect pests, they use "electric powder sprayers" to spray pesticides for prevention, which is five times more efficient than manual spraying. In addition, washing machines for non-staple foods, rust removal machines for small hardware, etc., are dozens to hundreds of times more efficient than manual operation, greatly saving labor. Now, the occurrence of commodity mildew and deterioration in this warehouse is rare.

    An important method to solve the problem of large storage quantities and small warehouse volume is to improve commodity stacking techniques. The employees of this warehouse have also created many advanced stacking methods in this regard. For example, in the department store unified warehouse storing enamelware and knitwear, it is difficult to stack high due to the softness of straw and sack packaging. Now, they use the method of "merging into large stacks" to make commodities mutually supported and reduce aisles and distance, expanding the width of cargo stacks from two meters to two point nine meters, and increasing the height from two meters to three meters, which can increase the warehouse volume utilization rate by more than 55%. The hardware warehouse stores various shapes of curved water and heating fittings of different sizes, occupying a large area. Now, they use wooden boxes stacked to make four-layer fixed shelves, and load the water and heating fittings into different specifications, saving nine-tenths of the occupied area compared to the past, and also facilitating delivery. Through these innovations, the warehouse's volume utilization rate in improving stacking has increased by an average of about 30% compared to the past, saving the state approximately 250,000 yuan in basic construction investment.

    The Nanzhan District Warehouse did not have difficulties in the process of realizing the "Four-化 Warehouse"; some comrades were afraid of trouble and thought it was easier to carry on their shoulders; some did not believe that goods could automatically go upstairs; some were afraid of losing face if they did not succeed; and some were worried that there were no materials to make new tools. Facing these ideological obstacles, the Party branch immediately raised questions such as "Do we want to engage in technological revolution? Can we do it? How should we do it?" to mobilize everyone to debate, and most comrades improved their understanding of technological innovation. However, on the road of technological innovation, we must also overcome the three major obstacles of "technology," "raw materials," and "equipment." The Party branch also put forward the slogan of "working hard, working hard, and starting from scratch," mobilizing everyone to adopt methods of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and cooperating internally and externally to break through the three obstacles. They established wood and metal workshops in a dilapidated waste product room; without drills for drilling holes, they used steel cones to punch hard; lacking blowers, they used hand-pulled bellows; not knowing how to build furnaces, forge iron, or connect fire, they visited teachers and sought advice everywhere; lacking materials, they made full use of old materials or waste sleepers, pads, and iron sheets. They also went to waste recycling stations, old goods stalls, and waste piles of large and small factories to find suitable pulleys, screws, and parts. If they could not find ready-made ones, they tried to find substitutes. Therefore, the manufacture of all tools cost only more than 1,000 yuan.

    “四化”仓库
    赵凯轩
    南站区库是江西省最大的、综合性的仓库，能储存货物一万九千吨左右，经常保持有一万三千多种商品。仓库物资进出频繁。在过去，这里商品的装卸、搬运、堆码、下货等全靠肩抬背扛，劳动强度大，工作效率低。去年生产大跃进以来，仓库储存量剧增，原有二十八名保管员远远不能满足工作需要。面对着困难，他们遵循着党所指引的方向，贯彻“从土入手，土洋结合，不断提高”的方针，发动职工开展技术革命和技术革新运动，掀起了用工具代替人力以提高工作效率的顽强战斗。现在，这个仓库的职工们已经创制出各式起重机、升降机、输送机、土轨道、土电话、滑梯、车子、空中索道、养护仪器、通讯设备、炊事用具等二百多件，每座仓间平均都有两台多机械工具和两辆多车子，每个保管员平均有七件革新工具，实现了搬运轧道车子化，上下起重半机械化，商品养护科学化，搬码技术先进化的“四化”仓库。
    现在，这个仓库已经建筑了十二条土轨道，通至每个重点仓间，其中三条已与铁路专用线相互衔接。五金组利用轨道列车，在一百公尺的距离内，一个人每趟可以轻松地载运一千公斤重的货物，等于过去二十个人的劳动量。这个仓库已做到仓仓有车子、处处有车子，而且都是根据各个仓间使用的特点设计的。如有一种可以载重三千公斤的“输送车”，可以在铁路岔道上行走，一个人就可以把站台货物分运到各个仓间，工作效率比过去提高了六十倍。还有一种可以载重二百公斤的“万能三轮车”，非常灵巧，无论地面、货楼、宽狭走道或直角拐弯，它都能行驶自如。
    商品堆码、卸垛常常需要支付大量劳力，过去一向靠人力操作，效率低、不安全，而且浪费仓库面积。现在他们创造的“南昌式转向起重机”，每次能起重一百五十公斤，抬高三米，可以四周旋转，任意选择货位。二百公斤重的铁桶装的樟脑油，过去用人力只能码两层，现在使用“南昌式转向起重机”就能堆三层。交通电工仓间货楼上储存的大部分是收音机等怕震商品，以往一个人一趟顶多只能背两箱，现在用自行车结构原理，制成“脚踏上下货输送机”，每趟可以载运十一箱，而且可以安全地连同输送机上下直接到达货架边。
    这个仓库过去检验商品质量都是凭感观，花费人力大，效率低，又不准确。在技术革新运动中，职工们创造与仿制了许多养护仪器和用具。如根据南方地区气候特点，这里凡储存有大宗容易发霉的商品的仓间，都装有“电动报温报湿器”及“自动开关门窗”的设备。这些设备可以帮助保管员及时了解、调剂库内温湿度的变化情况。对于容易生虫害的商品，他们就使用“电动喷粉器”散撒药剂防治，比用人工喷撒能提高效率五倍。再如用于副食品的洗霉机、用于小五金的打锈机等，都比手工操作提高效率数十倍至数百倍，大大节省了劳力。现在，这个仓库已经很少发生商品发霉变质现象。
    解决储存数量大，仓库容积小的重要方法是改进商品堆码技术。这个仓库的职工们在这方面也创作了许多先进码垛法。如储存搪瓷和针织品的百货统一仓间，由于稻草、麻袋包装柔软，很难堆高。现在他们把分散的同类包装的商品用“归并大垛”的办法，使商品相互支靠，并减少走道，缩小距离，货垛宽度由二米扩大为二米九，高度也由二米增至三米，可以提高仓库容积使用率55％以上。五金仓间储存有各种形状弯曲大小不一的水暖接头，占用面积很大。现在他们用木箱叠做四层固定货架，将水暖接头按不同规格装入，占用面积比过去节省了十分之九，而且发货也便利了。经过这样一些革新，全仓库在改进堆码方面仓库容积利用率已经比过去平均提高了30％左右，节约了国家基本建设投资约二十五万多元。
    南站区仓库在实现“四化仓库”过程中不是没有困难的；有的同志怕麻烦，认为不如肩扛省事；有的不相信货物能自动上楼；有的怕搞不成功丢面子；还有的顾虑没有材料制造新工具。面对着这些思想障碍，党支部立即提出“技术革命我们要不要搞？能不能搞？应该怎样搞？”等问题发动大家辩论，大多数同志对于技术革新的认识都有了提高。但是在技术革新的道路上，还必须过“技术”“原料”“设备”三重大关。党支部又提出“穷干、苦干，白手起家”的口号，发动大家采取因地制宜，就地取材，内外协作的办法，突破了三关。他们在一幢破烂不堪的废品室里建立了木、铁工车间；没有钻打眼就用钢锥硬冲；缺少鼓风机，就用手拉风箱；不会砌炉、锻铁、接火，就到处访师求经；没有材料，就充分利用旧料或废枕木、垫板、铁皮。他们还到废品收购站、旧货摊及大小工厂的废品堆里寻找适用的滑轮、螺丝、零件，找不到现成的，就设法搞代用品。因此全部工具的制造只花了一千多元。
