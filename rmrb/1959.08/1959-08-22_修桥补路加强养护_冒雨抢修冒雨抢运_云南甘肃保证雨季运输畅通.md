Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 21st: More than 10,000 road maintenance workers in Yunnan Province are repairing bridges and roads day and night, regardless of wind and rain, to ensure smooth traffic on highways during the rainy season.

Since the beginning of the rainy season, many road maintenance workers, under the slogan "Roads level and bridges solid, vehicles don't bump, road appearance is neat and signs are complete, no hindrance in sunny or rainy weather, little dust, passengers are comfortable and safe," often brave storms and heavy rain to inspect road surfaces and bridges, and immediately repair any damage found. The highway from Lufeng to Yipinglang passes through a gorge called Mifengqing, which often experienced landslides in previous rainy seasons. This year, the Lufeng Highway Maintenance Section specifically organized a repair team to inspect this section of the highway day and night. There have been no traffic blockages since the rainy season began. On the highway in the Dongchuan mining area, there is a dangerous road called Monkey Jump Cliff. Once, after a heavy rain, more than 3,000 cubic meters of soil and rocks collapsed. Road maintenance workers and local residents spent only two days clearing all the soil and rocks.

Technical innovation groups have been established in all central highway maintenance sections throughout the province to vigorously promote technical innovation. Recently, the Yunnan Provincial Highway Bureau comprehensively summarized and assessed the advanced road maintenance tools created by road maintenance workers since last year, such as foot-operated stone crushers, automatic unloading vehicles, and multi-plow mixers, and selectively promoted them according to the characteristics of each type of work, greatly improving work efficiency. The Lufeng Highway Maintenance Section insists on good material selection, good restoration of old road surfaces, good operating techniques, and frequent inspection, frequent repair, frequent watering, and frequent sand sweeping, so that after more than 710,000 vehicle trips, the road surface remains flat and complete. After the experience of this maintenance section was promoted throughout the province, ten highway maintenance sections, including Longling, Xiangyun, Jianchuan, and Yunxian, have reached their advanced level.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 21st: More than 20,000 employees of the Gansu Province highway transportation department are overcoming the difficulties brought about by the rainy season and rushing to transport "supplies" for various industrial and mining enterprises.

Many areas in Gansu are currently experiencing the rainy season. The frequency and intensity of rainfall are unprecedented in recent years. Torrential rains and flash floods often threaten highway transportation. In response to this situation, the highway transportation department has organized two lines to fight against floods and heavy rain: on the one hand, mobilizing more than 4,000 workers and laborers to strengthen highway maintenance work and repair road surfaces washed away by flash floods; on the other hand, concentrating more than 1,000 trucks and horse-drawn carts on the roads around the main industrial and mining areas to launch a competition to haul more and faster, transporting materials for industrial and mining enterprises day and night, regardless of sunny or rainy weather.

Now, repair teams have been organized along many highways, drainage ditches have been dug, and flood barriers have been built. On August 2nd, one span of a wooden bridge on the Yong (deng) Yao (jie) road was washed away by floodwaters after a heavy rain. After the repair workers discovered this, they immediately dispatched more than 60 people to rush to repair it overnight, and it was repaired and opened to traffic the next day.

Truck drivers have also demonstrated the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity. Truck drivers transporting materials such as iron ore, gypsum, and coal on simple highways pre-emptively transport materials from the mining areas along the simple highways to the main highways when the weather is clear. When the simple highways are impassable due to rain, they use the main highways to transport materials to Lanzhou and other places. Automobiles in Lanzhou have also implemented joint transportation with horse-drawn carts, and the efficiency of transporting building materials such as sand and gravel has increased by more than half compared to when automobiles or horse-drawn carts transport them alone.

### 修桥补路加强养护　冒雨抢修冒雨抢运  云南甘肃保证雨季运输畅通

　　修桥补路加强养护　冒雨抢修冒雨抢运
    云南甘肃保证雨季运输畅通
    据新华社昆明21日电　云南省一万多名养路工人不分日夜、不避风雨地修桥补路，保证公路在雨季畅通无阻。
    进入雨季以来，许多养路工人在“路平桥固车不颠，路容整洁标志全，晴雨无阻灰尘少，旅客舒适又安全”的口号下，经常冒着狂风暴雨，检查路面桥涵，发现损坏，立即抢修。禄丰到一平浪的公路要经过一段峡谷叫蜜蜂箐，往年雨季这里经常坍方；今年禄丰公路养护段专门组织了抢修队，在这段公路上日夜检查，雨季以来没有发生过车辆阻塞现象。东川矿区的公路上，有处险道叫猴跳岩，有一次在一场暴雨过后坍下土石三千多立方米，养路职工和当地居民只用两天时间就将土石全部清理完毕。
    全省各个中心公路养护段都成立了技术革新小组，大搞技术革新。最近，云南省公路管理局全面地总结鉴定了去年以来各地养路职工创造的脚踏碎石机、自动卸料车、多犁拌合器等先进养路工具，根据各个工种的特点，有选择地加以推广，大大提高了工作效率。禄丰公路养护段职工坚持做到材料选配好、旧路面恢复好、操作技术好和勤检查、勤修补、勤洒水、勤扫沙，使这段公路在行驶七十一万多车次之后，路面仍然平坦完整。这个养护段的经验在全省推广以后，目前已经有龙陵、祥云、剑川、云县等十个公路养护段达到了他们的先进水平。
    据新华社兰州21日电　甘肃省公路交通部门的两万多名职工，正在排除雨季带来的困难，为各工矿企业抢运“粮草”。
    甘肃许多地区现在正逢雨季，降雨次数之多，雨量之大，为近年来所罕有，暴雨山洪常常威胁着公路运输。公路交通部门针对这种情况，已经组织两条线，向洪水暴雨展开搏斗：一方面动员了四千多工人、民工，加强公路养护工作，抢修被山洪冲毁的路面；一方面在主要工矿区四周的道路上，集中了一千多辆汽车、马车，展开多拉快跑竞赛，晴雨无阻，日夜为工矿企业运输物资。
    现在许多公路两旁都已组织起抢修队，挖好排水沟，筑好拦洪坝。8月2日，永（登）窑（街）路上的一座木桥被暴雨后的洪水冲毁一孔，抢修工人发觉后，立即出动六十多人连夜抢修，第二天就修好通车。
    汽车司机们也发挥了苦干、实干、巧干的精神。在简易公路上担任运输铁矿石、石膏、煤等物资的汽车司机，天晴的时候把物资从简易公路沿线矿区预先运送到公路干线上，下雨简易公路无法通行时，就利用公路干线把物资运到兰州等地。兰州市的汽车还同马车实行联合运输，运输砂石等建筑材料的效率比汽车或马车单独运输时提高一半以上。
