Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 11th. The employees of the capital's steel enterprises saw a rapid increase in the production of steel and steel materials in the first ten days of the major battles of August and September. The average daily output of steel increased by 3.7% compared with the same period last month, and steel materials increased by 23.8%. The average daily output in the latter five days of these ten days increased even faster than the first five days, with steel increasing by 29.5% and steel materials increasing by 43%. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, which accounts for more than 90% of the city's pig iron production, increased its average daily pig iron production in the first ten days of August by 3.2% compared with the same period last month.

In order to better complete the steel production plan for August, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of relevant departments on the 10th to deploy the battle for the middle ten days of the month. It was decided to deeply study the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," further boost morale, and work hard. The meeting also proposed the following three specific measures: First, strictly implement the responsibility system for the supply of raw materials, striving to supply the raw materials needed by various steel enterprises on time, with good quality, and in sufficient quantity; Second, strengthen technical management to further improve product quality; Third, firmly grasp the daily plan and improve the daily production level.

After the meeting, leading cadres of many factories immediately took action. The main leading cadres of the Beijing Steel Plant have been assigned to go deep into the production sites and work alongside the workers. All the cadres of the iron smelting department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have also gone to various work teams to specifically lead production.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th. Shanghai's steel plants are tightly grasping the weak links in current production, deeply mobilizing the masses to carry out competitions, and in the first ten days of August, steel production exceeded the highest level since this year in late July, an increase of 25% compared with the same period last month; the quality of steel and the rate of first-class products have also generally improved compared with last month.

Since entering August, Shanghai's steel plants have tightened their leadership over the weak links in production, with leading cadres taking the lead in seriously solving the key problems in current production. At the beginning of August, the converter furnace life of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 once declined slightly. The plant's leading cadres immediately found the workshop cadres, steelworkers, and furnace-building workers to hold a forum. After analysis, it was found that the main key to the decline in furnace life was the poor quality of lime used for slagging and the excessive blowing time during steelmaking. Therefore, the leading cadres and workers conducted strict control experiments on lime quality and blowing operations on two converters. The furnace life quickly increased from an average of thirty furnaces in the past to more than forty furnaces; steel production and quality also improved.

"Grasp tightly, grasp meticulously," grasping several times per shift, is an important method for Shanghai's steel plant leaders to manage current production. Their method is: before work, grasp the inspection of machinery and equipment, understand the production situation of the previous shift and the problems that occurred in production, and immediately pay attention to solving them after work to ensure that the battle can be launched as soon as work begins; four hours after production, hold a mid-shift meeting to check whether production is normal and whether any furnaces or other auxiliary equipment have fallen behind; two hours before the end of the shift, conduct another inspection of the entire production process and completion of tasks, on the one hand, to ensure the overfulfillment of the shift's tasks, and on the other hand, to organize various sections and groups to seize the time to create favorable conditions for the next shift's production. Due to the tight grasp of each shift, the second converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 averaged 903 tons of steel per day in the first nine days of August, exceeding the original planned average daily output and creating the highest record since this year.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 11th. Jilin Province's coal mine workers are full of energy. As of August 10th, the province has produced 331,861 tons of raw coal, exceeding the production plan for the first ten days of the month, an increase of 20.6% compared with the same period in July; the quality of coal has also met national requirements.

Since August, the Party committees of various mines in Jilin Province have greatly strengthened the leadership of first-line production. The Party committee of Yingcheng Coal Mine formed three work groups to go to various mines to guide production, solve key problems in production, and work and labor together with the miners, greatly boosting the morale of the workers. The average daily output of the entire mine in the first ten days of August reached 4,107 tons, exceeding the original planned target of 4,000 tons of coal per day. The Liaoyuan Mining Bureau organized five inspection teams to go deep into various mines to mobilize the masses, which had a very good effect. In the past, it took more than ten days to install a belt chute in some mining areas of Taixin Mine, but now it can be installed in about three days. The entire mine overproduced 1,683 tons of raw coal on the 1st and 2nd alone. While grasping coal mining, various mines have further strengthened tunneling work.

In order to ensure the completion of the raw coal production plan for August, the Jilin Provincial Coal Industry Administration recently sent three more work groups to key coal mines to help promote advanced experience.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Zibo, August 11th. The Zibo Mining Bureau, which is responsible for more than one-third of Shandong Province's coal production, has established the idea of ​​always striving to move forward, which has led to a double increase in coal mining and tunneling. The average daily coal output in the first ten days of August increased by 6.5% compared with the average daily output in the entire month of July. The daily output in the last three days of this period all exceeded 20,000 tons. The footage of main roadway tunneling increased by 3.61% compared with the same period in July.

From March to May this year, the Zibo Mining Bureau overfulfilled the state plan. In June, due to the lack of correct understanding of some temporary difficulties in production by some cadres, a mood of fear and relaxation was generated, and coal production declined. The Party Committee of the Mining Bureau fully mobilized the masses to speak out and debate in late July, which improved the understanding of cadres and the masses. Especially at the beginning of August, after summarizing and evaluating the work in July and discussing the plan for August, a mass movement of "six checks and six comparisons" was launched in the entire mining bureau, checking enthusiasm and comparing output, checking working hours and comparing efficiency, checking safety and comparing the implementation of regulations and measures, checking waste and comparing savings, checking the promotion of advanced experience and comparing technological innovation, and checking labor discipline and comparing attendance, as well as "five searches" such as finding experiences and lessons and finding key points, further stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and quickly set off a competition upsurge between mines and mines, teams and teams, and individuals and individuals.

In order to promote the in-depth development of the competition movement, cadres from various mines in the bureau went deep into the lower levels, strengthened mechanical maintenance work, and continued to promote effective advanced experiences such as double circulation and multi-circulation, which also played a significant role in accelerating coal mining and tunneling speed.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 11th. The workers of various coal mines in Shanxi Province are working hard and skillfully, and have achieved successive victories in the first ten days of August. According to statistics, the total raw coal produced by state-owned coal mines in the province in the first ten days of August reached more than 530,000 tons, an increase of more than 14.1% compared with the same period in July.

Since the third quarter, the workers of various coal mines in Shanxi Province have launched a vigorous battle to seize coal. In August, the workers' enthusiasm was even greater, pushing the battle to seize coal to a new climax. After summarizing the production in July, the Datong, Fenxi, and Yangquan coal mines established advanced pacesetters, and the workers widely launched "opponent competitions" to learn from and catch up with the advanced. Through the "opponent competition," some backward coal mining teams caught up, enabling the entire mine to overfulfill the plan every day. The coal output of the entire mine in the first ten days of August increased by 17.5% compared with the same period in July.

At the beginning of August, the Party committees of various coal mines promptly criticized the right-leaning and relaxed sentiments among some cadres by holding telephone conferences and worker representative meetings, and quickly adopted measures such as adjusting labor organization, tapping the potential of equipment and materials, and promoting advanced experiences; Various coal mines in the province have also successively transferred more than 1,720 non-production personnel to supplement the production team, adding more than 20 back mining working faces and more than a dozen tunneling working faces, creating favorable conditions for production in August.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, August 11th. The workers of Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine overfulfilled the raw coal production plan for the first ten days of August by 2,002 tons, with an average daily output increase of 3.36% compared with the same period last month; the tunneling footage completed 108.5% of the plan, an increase of 114.9 meters compared with the same period last month, achieving a double harvest in coal mining and tunneling.

Since August, the Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine has encountered many difficulties in production due to large changes in the coal seam and continuous rainfall. In order to ensure the completion of the August plan, the workers of the entire mine launched competitions between districts, teams, and individuals. Various units have formulated plans to promote advanced experience aimed at the key to production. Eight production units, including coal mining and tunneling, have successively promoted 48 kinds of advanced experience and established 190 pacesetters, effectively improving the efficiency of coal mining and tunneling. The main types of work such as electromechanical, backfilling, tunneling, coal mining, and support also organized advanced experience dissemination teams to disseminate and promote advanced experience to various mining areas.

    乘胜前进，争取全月大捷全季大捷！
　　一批钢煤健将胜利跨过八月上旬
　　北京
    新华社11日讯　首都钢铁企业的职工在大战8、9月的头十天中，钢和钢材的产量迅速上升。钢的平均日产量比上月同期提高3.7％，钢材提高23.8％。这十天的后五天比前五天的平均日产量增长得更快，其中，钢增长29.5％，钢材增长43％。占全市生铁产量90％以上的石景山钢铁公司，8月上旬的生铁平均日产量比上月同期提高了3.2％。
    为了更好地完成8月份的钢铁生产计划，中共北京市委已在10日召集各有关部门举行会议部署了中旬的战斗，决定深入学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，进一步鼓足干劲，大干特干。会上并且提出下列三项具体措施：一、严格原料、材料供应的责任制，力争按时按质按量地供应各钢铁企业所需要的原料、材料；二、加强技术管理工作，进一步提高产品质量；三、狠狠地抓日计划，提高日产水平。
    会后，许多工厂的领导干部立即行动起来。北京钢厂的主要领导干部已经分工深入生产现场，跟班劳动。石景山钢铁公司炼铁部的全体干部也都分头到各个班组具体领导生产。
　　上海
    据新华社上海11日电　上海各钢铁厂紧抓当前生产中的薄弱环节，深入发动群众大搞竞赛，8月上旬钢的产量超过了今年以来产量最高的7月下旬，比上月同期增长了25％；钢的质量和一级品率，也比上月普遍提高。
    进入8月以来，上海各钢铁厂都抓紧了对生产薄弱环节的领导，领导干部带头认真解决当前生产的关键问题。8月初，上钢五厂转炉炉龄一度略有下降，厂的领导干部马上找车间干部、炼钢工人和砌炉工人开座谈会，经过分析找到了炉龄下降的主要关键在于造渣用的石灰质量不好和炼钢过程中吹炼时间过长。于是，领导干部就和工人一起在两只转炉上进行严格控制石灰质量和吹炼操作的试验，炉龄很快由过去的平均三十炉提高到四十多炉；钢的产量、质量也有所提高。
    “抓得紧、抓得细”一班抓几次，这是上海各钢铁厂领导当前生产的一条重要方法。他们的抓法是：上班前抓紧检查机器设备，摸清上一班生产情况和生产中出现的问题，上班后马上注意解决，保证了一上班就能展开战斗；生产四小时后，开一次班中会，检查生产是否正常，有没有炉子或其他辅助设备掉队的情况；下班前的两小时，再对整个生产过程和完成任务情况作一次检查，一方面保证超额完成本班任务，一方面组织各工段、各小组抓紧为下一班生产创造有利条件。上钢三厂第二转炉车间，由于班班抓得紧，在8月份的前九天，平均日产钢达九百零三吨，超过了原订平均日产量的计划，创造了今年以来的最高纪录。
　　吉林
    新华社长春11日电　吉林省煤矿职工干劲十足，到8月10日止，全省已经生产原煤三十三万一千八百六十一吨，超额完成了上旬生产计划，比7月份同期增长20.6％；煤炭的质量也达到了国家要求。
    8月份以来，吉林省各矿党委都大大加强了第一线的生产领导。营城煤矿党委组成三个工作组，下到各矿一面指导生产，解决生产中的关键问题，一面和矿工一起生产劳动，大大鼓舞了职工的干劲，全矿8月上旬的平均日产量达到四千一百零七吨，超过原计划日产煤四千吨的指标。辽源矿务局组织了五个检查团深入各矿发动群众，收到了很好的效果。过去太信矿有些采区安设一个皮带溜子要十多天，现在三天左右就安装好了，全矿仅1、2两日就超产原煤一千六百八十三吨。各矿在抓采煤的同时，还进一步加强了掘进工作。
    为了保证完成8月份的原煤生产计划，吉林省煤炭管理局最近又派出三个工作组，深入重点煤矿，帮助推广先进经验。
　　山东
    新华社淄博11日电　担负山东省三分之一以上煤炭生产任务的淄博矿务局树立事事向前赶的思想，使采煤和掘进双双提高。8月上旬煤的平均日产量比7月全月的平均日产量提高了6.5％。这一旬后三天的日产量都突破了两万吨。主巷掘进进尺比7月份同期上升3.61％。
    今年3月到5月，淄博矿务局都超额完成国家计划。6月间，由于部分干部对生产中的某些暂时困难缺乏正确认识，产生了畏难松劲情绪，煤炭产量下降。矿务局党委在7月下旬充分发动群众鸣放、辩论，提高了干部和群众的认识。尤其是8月初，经过总结评比7月份工作和讨论8月份计划，在全矿务局展开了查干劲比产量、查工作时间比效率、查安全比执行规程措施、查浪费比节约、查推广先进经验比技术革新、查劳动纪律比出勤的“六查六比”，和找经验教训、找关键等“五找”的群众运动，进一步激发了广大职工的劳动热情，迅速地掀起了井与井、班与班、个人与个人的竞赛热潮。
    为推动竞赛运动深入开展，全局各矿干部纷纷深入下层，加强了机械检修工作，继续推广双循环、多循环等行之有效的先进经验，对加速采煤、掘进速度也起了显著作用。
　　山西
    新华社太原11日电　山西省各煤矿职工大干巧干，8月头十天生产纷纷告捷。据统计，全省各国营煤矿8月上旬生产的原煤共达五十三万多吨，比7月同期增产14.1％以上。
    第三季度以来，山西省各煤矿的职工就开展了轰轰烈烈的夺煤大战。8月份职工们的干劲更大，使夺煤大战进入了新的高潮。大同、汾西、阳泉煤矿在总结7月份生产后，树立了先进标兵，职工们广泛地展开了学先进、赶先进的“对手赛”。大同煤矿通过“对手赛”，一部分落后的采煤队赶上来了，使全矿天天超额完成计划，全矿8月上旬的煤产量比7月同期提高了17.5％。
    各煤矿党委在8月初都通过召开电话会议、职工代表会等形式，及时批判了部分干部中的右倾松劲情绪，并且迅速采取了调整劳动组织、挖掘器材物资潜力和推广先进经验等措施；全省各煤矿还先后抽调了一千七百二十多个非生产人员充实了生产队伍，增加了二十多个回采工作面和十几个掘进工作面，为8月份的生产创造了有利的条件。
　　河北
    新华社唐山11日电　开滦赵各庄煤矿职工超额两千零二吨完成了8月上旬原煤生产计划，平均日产量比上月同期提高了3.36％；掘进进尺完成计划108.5％，比上月同期提高了一百一十四点九米，获得了采煤掘进双丰收。
    8月份以来，赵各庄煤矿因为煤层变化大，又连日降雨，生产上遇到许多困难。全矿职工为了保证完成8月份计划，开展了区与区、组与组、人与人的竞赛。各单位都针对生产关键制定了推广先进经验的计划。采煤、掘进等八个生产单位，先后推广了四十八种先进经验和树立了一百九十名标兵，有效地提高了采煤和掘进的效率。机电、回柱、掘进、采煤、支柱等主要工种，还组织了先进经验传播队，到各个矿区传播和推广先进经验。（附图片）
