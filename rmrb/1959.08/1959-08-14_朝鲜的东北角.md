　　The Northeast Corner of Korea
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
　　Recently, I visited the Hamgyongbuk-do and Ryanggang-do areas in the northeast corner of Korea. From the coastal city of Chongjin on the east coast to Hyesan on the Yalu River at the foot of Mount Paektu, I witnessed the surging tide of socialist construction being undertaken by the Korean people.
                Along the East Sea
　　The direct train from Pyongyang to Chongjin travels along the east coast after passing Hamhung, offering spectacular scenery. On one side are verdant mountains. Approaching Chongjin, one can see the snow-capped Crown Peak in the distance, rising above the layered mountains. On the other side is the sea. The azure waters embrace clusters of white waves that dance on the white sandy beaches, circling the scattered black reefs along the coast. Picturesque fishing villages dot the coastline, with newly built rows of Korean people's houses, their red tiles and white walls, standing out vividly against the backdrop of green mountains and clear waters. Socialist construction has made this beautiful land even more splendid.
　　This area is not only scenic but also rich in resources. The sea yields famous pollack, mackerel, flounder, whales, sea cucumbers, and more. Early summer is mackerel season. When mackerel are abundant, the sea even turns black (because mackerel have black backs). In the past, fishermen would load small boats with stones and throw them into the sea to kill the dense schools of mackerel on the surface. A boatload of stones could be exchanged for a boatload of fish. Of course, this method is no longer used. "Go to the deep sea!" Encouraged by this resounding slogan of the Korean Workers' Party, hundreds of trawlers set sail during the fishing season. Last year, northern Korea produced 680,000 tons of fish, most of which were caught in the East Sea. Currently, Korea's per capita fish catch exceeds that of Japan. Last year, Chongjin also organized whaling fleets and began whaling. The famous whaler Son I-dong caught 41 large whales last year alone.
          New Look of the Steel City
　　The Changbai and Machonryong mountain ranges meander across the northeast corner of Korea. These mountains hold rich mineral deposits, particularly coal and iron, which account for the largest reserves in Korea. Chongjin is the iron smelting center of this area, home to Korea's largest ironworks, the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex. In the next four to five years, this ironworks will be expanded into a steel industrial base with an annual output of 2.5 million tons of steel, making Chongjin the steel capital of Korea.
　　As the train approaches the outskirts of Chongjin, one can see the two steel giants of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex spewing smoke high into the air. These two blast furnaces were severely damaged during the war and were officially restored to production in March of this year (the first blast furnace was restored in 1955 and underwent major repairs last winter and spring).
　　When I visited, the second blast furnace was tapping iron. Youth work team leader Hwang Dae-yeon told me that both blast furnaces now produce over 800 tons of iron per day, compared to only about 280 tons per day under Japanese rule. They are now striving for a daily output of 1,000 tons.
　　Not far from the blast furnaces, a converter steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 400,000 tons is under construction. Thanks to the use of prefabricated methods, a huge factory building has been largely completed in less than half a year, and a 10-ton Bessemer converter is being installed. All four converters will be installed this year, and the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex will produce steel for the first time. In addition, coking ovens are being built within the factory, railway lines are being laid, and a rolling mill will soon be constructed, forming a comprehensive iron and steel industrial base.
　　Chongjin is an important industrial city that was reduced to rubble during the war. Today, rows of red residential buildings have been built on both sides of the city's central street. On the day I arrived, a provincial theater with over 1,000 seats was also completed. The city has built and restored 50 to 60 factories and enterprises, with an industrial output three times that of the Japanese colonial period. In addition to the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex and Chongjin Steel Mill, the important factories here include an artificial fiber factory, a shipyard, a mining machinery factory, and a net weaving factory.
            Summer in the Forest Area
　　To get from Chongjin to Hyesan, one must transfer at Kilju. Once on the Kilju-Hyesan train, the scenery changes dramatically. High, cloud-piercing mountains line up like screens. The cedar forests on the hillsides have just put on their new green clothes, and the lush fir trees sprout tender yellow leaves on their branches, like trees full of yellow flowers, a unique scene of the forest area.
　　The train moves forward and backward in sections, following a "Z" shaped mountain railway all the way to the high mountain station of Paegam, 1,400 meters above sea level. Although it is early summer, the mountain wind blowing from the window is still chilly. Paegam Station is filled with trains loaded with timber. This is one of the main forest areas in northern Korea.
　　Northern Korea is rich in forest resources, with forests covering 77% of the total land area of northern Korea. However, due to excessive logging during the Japanese colonial period and destruction during the American war of aggression, the forests suffered great losses. After the war, the Korean people launched afforestation campaigns every year, planting a total of 3 billion trees. This spring, youth students and cadres from various places also organized expeditions to afforest the barren mountains in this area. Today, the patches of young forests on the slopes are the result of their labor.
　　In the past, lumberjacks here used handicraft methods for logging. Every year, after the mountains were covered in snow, they used oxen to drag the logs down the mountain. After liberation, the Republic government built 90 kilometers of forest railway in this area, and also widely adopted tractors, chainsaws and logging combines. In the past, a lumberjack could cut seven to ten cubic meters of wood a day; now, those who work efficiently can cut up to thirty cubic meters. Last year, the Republic produced 3.15 million cubic meters of logs, double the pre-war figure, about half of which were produced in Ryanggang-do.
      Samsu and Kapsan, Past and Present
　　Even today, Koreans still habitually call Ryanggang-do the Samsu Kapsan area. Samsu refers to the Yalu River, the Tumen River and the Changjin River. This area is a mountainous region over 800 meters above sea level, full of towering trees, where tigers and wolves roam. It is known as a poor mountainous and desolate area. During the feudal Joseon Dynasty, the Korean emperors exiled criminals here to cut wood and do hard labor, never to return home. Today, in the high tide of socialist construction, the face of Samsu Kapsan is changing rapidly. The changes in Hyesan, the capital of Ryanggang-do, represent the changes in this region.
　　Hyesan, located on the south bank of the Yalu River, across from Changbai County in China, had only 3,000 people before liberation. Today, it has become a city of 35,000 people, the political, economic, and cultural center of Ryanggang-do. Wide roads have been newly opened in the city, and rows of three- and four-story buildings have been built. A large area of red-tiled, white-walled forestry workers' villages has appeared on a hillside. Before liberation, Hyesan did not even have a middle school. Today, there are nine specialized schools and middle schools, including a forestry university and a higher forestry vocational school. In Wiyon, near Hyesan, the largest sawmill in the Republic was newly built after the war, producing large amounts of timber to meet the needs of socialist construction. In addition, a flax textile factory and a paper mill, among other modern factories, are under construction in Hyesan.
　　Because Ryanggang-do is located in a cold highland area, it has historically not produced enough grain. Moreover, because the autumn is cold early, it is often affected by frost and freezing damage. When Premier Kim Il-sung came here to inspect last year, he proposed the slogan "Rely on the mountains to eat from the mountains," and called on farmers to plant more potatoes, which have a short growing season and are suitable for cold regions. As a result, a bumper harvest was obtained last year, and farmers could eat what they harvested in one year for two years. Today, potatoes, flax, and hops used for beer have become the three treasures here. In addition, farmers are vigorously developing animal husbandry, beekeeping, and raising tussah silkworms. According to the instructions of Premier Kim Il-sung, they are fully tapping the rich resources of the mountainous area to turn Samsu Kapsan into a socialist paradise. Under the diligent hands of the Korean people, the northeast corner of Korea has been built into Korea's heavy industry base, forestry base, aquatic product base, and animal husbandry base. In this era of Chollima, high mountains and the sea are offering their treasures. (Picture attached)

### 朝鲜的东北角

　　朝鲜的东北角
　　本报记者　王玉章
    最近记者访问了朝鲜的东北角咸镜北道和两江道地区。从东海之滨的清津走到鸭绿江畔、白头山下的惠山，到处看到朝鲜人民掀起的汹涌澎湃的社会主义的建设热潮。
                沿着东海
    从平壤到清津的直达列车，过了咸兴以后就一直沿着东海岸行驶，沿途景色奇美。一边是翠绿的群山，到了清津附近，极目远望，在层峦叠嶂的丛山之上，还可以看见满头白雪的冠帽峰；另一边是大海，湛蓝的海水拥着一簇簇白色的浪花跑到雪白的沙滩上来，环绕着岸边星罗棋布的黑色的礁石跳舞。海边到处有疏疏落落的渔村，渔村中新盖的一排排的朝鲜人民的新住宅，红瓦、白墙，在这青山绿水之间，颜色分外鲜艳。社会主义建设把这锦绣般的江山打扮得更加美丽了。
    这里不仅风景优美，资源更是丰富。海里出产有名的明太鱼、鲭鱼、比目鱼、鲸鱼、海参等。初夏是鲭鱼的汛期，鲭鱼来得多的时候，连海水都变黑了（鲭鱼的背是黑的）。过去，渔民们载一小船石头到海里去，用石头向海中投掷，把密集在海面上的鲭鱼打死，一船石头能换一船鱼回来。现在当然早已不用这种办法捕鱼了。“到深海去！”在朝鲜劳动党提出的这个响亮口号的鼓舞下，每逢鱼汛，数百只拖网渔轮就开出大海。去年朝鲜北部生产了六十八万吨鱼，其中大部分是在东海捕的。目前朝鲜的捕鱼量，按人口平均计算已经超过日本了。去年清津还组织了捕鲸船队，开始捕鲸。著名的捕鲸能手孙二东在去年就捕了四十一只大鲸鱼。
          钢城新貌
    长白山脉和摩天岭山脉的群山绵亘起伏，盘桓在朝鲜的东北角，这些山中埋藏着丰富的矿藏，特别是煤和铁的蕴藏量，占全朝鲜第一位。清津市是这里的炼铁中心，它有朝鲜最大的炼铁厂——金策制铁所。在今后四、五年内，这个炼铁厂还要扩建成年产二百五十万吨钢的钢铁工业基地，清津市也就成为朝鲜的钢都了。
    列车一驶近清津市郊，人们就可以看见矗立在高空的金策制铁所的两个钢铁巨人在喷吐着浓烟。这两座高炉战争时期遭到了严重的破坏，今年3月一齐正式恢复了生产（其中第一号高炉在1955年先恢复生产，去冬今春进行了大补修）。
    记者去访问时，正值二号高炉出铁。青年作业班长黄大渊告诉记者，这两座高炉现在都是日产八百多吨铁，而在日本统治时期日产量只有二百八十吨左右。现在他们正在努力争取日产一千吨。
    在离高炉不远的地方，一个年产四十万吨的转炉炼钢车间正在兴建起来。由于建设者采用了装配式的方法，不到半年时间，一座巨大的厂房已经基本上建成，一座十吨级的贝氏转炉正在安装。今年内四座转炉都要装好，并在金策制铁所第一次生产出钢来。另外，厂内还在兴建炼焦炉，敷设铁路线，不久还要建设轧钢车间，一个综合钢铁工业基地正在形成着。
    清津是一座重要的工业城市，在战时被毁成一片平地，今天市内中心大街两旁已经建设起两排红色的住宅楼房。记者到达的那天，一座有一千多个席位的道立剧场又落成了。市内新建和恢复起来的工厂企业有五、六十个，工业产值达到日本统治时期的三倍。除了金策制铁所和清津炼钢厂两座钢铁企业外，这里的重要的工厂还有：人造纤维厂、造船所、矿山机械厂、织网工厂等。
            林区之夏
    从清津到惠山，要经过吉州转车。一上吉州—惠山的列车，车外景色大变，高插入云的群山像屏风般罗列着，山坡上的杉林刚刚换上翠绿的新衣，苍郁郁的枞树，枝头上吐出嫩黄的新叶，恰像黄花满树，是林区特有的景色。
    中途，列车前进一段又后退一段，沿着“之”字形的盘山铁路一直盘上海拔一千四百米的高山车站——白岩。时候虽是初夏，但山风从窗外吹来还充满凉意。白岩车站上到处排满了满载木材的列车，这里是朝鲜北部主要林区之一。
    朝鲜北部森林资源十分丰富，山林面积占朝鲜北部土地总面积的77％，但由于日本统治时期的滥伐和美国侵朝战争的破坏，森林受到了很大的损失。战后朝鲜人民年年展开造林运动，共植树三十亿株。今年春天，各地的青年学生和干部还组织了远征队，到这一带的荒山上来造林。现在，各处山坡上的一片片幼林，就是他们的劳动成果。
    过去，这里的伐木工人是用手工业方法采伐的，每年到了大雪封山后，用牛拉着木头从山上滑下来。解放后共和国政府在这一带修了九十公里长的森林铁道，还广泛地采用了拖拉机、电锯和伐木康拜因。过去一个伐木工人一天伐木七到十立方，现在工作效率高的达到三十立方。去年共和国生产了三百一十五万立方原木，比战前增加了一倍，其中约有一半是两江道内生产的。
      三水甲山今昔
    直到今天朝鲜人还习惯地把两江道叫作三水甲山地区，所谓三水就是鸭绿江、图们江和长津江，这一带都是海拔八百米以上的山区，到处是参天的林木，虎狼出没，是有名的穷山恶水的地区。在封建李朝时代，朝鲜的皇帝把罪犯流放到这里来伐木头，作苦工，一生不得回乡。今天，在社会主义建设高潮中，三水甲山的面貌正在迅速地变化着。两江道的首府惠山市的变化就代表了这个地区的变化。
    在鸭绿江南岸、同中国的长白县隔江相对的惠山，在解放前只有三千人，现在已成为有三万五千人口的城市，是两江道的政治、经济、文化中心。城内新开辟了宽阔的马路，一排排三层和四层大楼兴建起来了，红瓦白墙一大片的林业工人村在一个山坡上出现了。解放前惠山连一所中学也没有，今天，已经有林业大学、高等林业专门学校等九个专门学校和中学。在惠山附近的渭渊，战后新建了一座共和国最大的制材厂，生产着大量的木材供应社会主义建设的需要。另外，在惠山还正在兴建亚麻纺织厂和造纸厂等现代化的工厂。
    两江道因为处在寒冷的高原地带，向来生产的粮食不够吃。而且因为秋天冷得早，经常受到霜灾和冻灾。去年金日成首相来到这里视察时，提出了“靠山吃山”的口号，并且号召农民多种生长期短、适合于高寒地带的马铃薯，结果去年获得了大丰收，农民们收一年可以吃两年。现在，马铃薯、亚麻和作啤酒用的蛇麻草已成为这里的三宝。另外，农民们正在大力发展畜牧业，还养蜂，养柞蚕，根据金日成首相的指示，充分发掘山区的富源，把三水甲山变成社会主义乐园。朝鲜的东北角，在朝鲜人民勤劳的双手下已建设成为朝鲜的重工业基地、林业基地、水产基地和畜牧业基地。在这个千里马的时代，高山和大海都在献出它们的宝藏。（附图片）
