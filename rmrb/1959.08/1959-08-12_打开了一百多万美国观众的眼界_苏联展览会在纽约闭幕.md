Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 11th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 11th, the Soviet Exhibition of Achievements in Science, Technology, and Culture closed in New York at 22:00 (local time) on the 10th.

The Soviet exhibition aroused great interest among people from all walks of life in American society. According to unofficial statistics, more than 1.1 million people from various cities in the United States visited the exhibition during its 42 days of display. Especially in the last few days of the exhibition, the audience was extremely enthusiastic. The streets leading to the "Coliseum" building were crowded with vehicles, and people lined up at the door several hours before the exhibition opened. According to the exhibition management, the number of visitors reached 60,000 to 70,000 per day during these days.

During the exhibition, Soviet music and dance evenings were held at Madison Square Garden, the largest performance venue in New York. The famous Pyatnitsky State Russian Folk Chorus, the Moscow and Leningrad Ballet dance troupes, and others participated in the performances. At the same time, the Soviet widescreen panoramic films "How Vast, My Motherland" and "The Magic Mirror" were screened at the "Mayfair" cinema. Tens of thousands of American viewers watched the films and performances.

Throughout the exhibition, American viewers showed extremely keen interest in the lives of the Soviet people. In conversations with the exhibition staff, many people inquired in detail about how Soviet people work, study, and rest. The answers to these questions often surprised them and aroused their envy. Many people said, "Your exhibition has opened our eyes and told us the truth about your country. After seeing all these exhibits, we cannot believe the Soviet Union has aggressive intentions as propagated by the American newspapers."

American newspapers gave high praise to the Soviet exhibition. "New York Herald Tribune" wrote in an editorial that many of the visitors to the Soviet exhibition (numbering over one million) thought it was indeed an interesting and impressive exhibition. The American company "Blankenship, Gruneau & Ostberg" conducted a poll, and among the 650 people who participated in the survey, 79% believed that "the exhibition left them with a good impression," 83% hoped that the exhibition could be shown in cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, and 74% were in favor of holding a similar exhibition in New York next year.

Manzhulo, the general director of the exhibition, emphasized in a statement to American and foreign journalists that holding exhibitions in each other's countries by the Soviet Union and the United States helps to enhance the atmosphere of mutual trust between the two countries. Many ordinary Americans mentioned this in the visitor's book or in letters, which shows that the American people, like the Soviet people, hope to live in a peaceful environment. (Attached picture)

　　打开了一百多万美国观众的眼界
　　苏联展览会在纽约闭幕
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：苏联科学、技术、文化成就展览会已于10日二十二时（当地时间）在纽约闭幕。
    苏联展览会在美国社会各阶层人士中引起了很大的兴趣，据非正式统计，在展出的四十二天里，有来自美国各个城市的一百一十多万人参观了展览，特别是展出的最后几天，观众极为踊跃，通向“科洛西姆”大楼的大街上挤满了车辆，人们在展览会开门前几个钟头就排队等在门口，据展览会管理处统计，在这几天里每天前往参观的人数达六、七万。
    在展览会举行期间，在纽约最大的演出场所麦迪逊广场公园举行了苏联音乐舞蹈晚会，参加演出的有著名的比亚特尼茨基国家俄罗斯民间合唱团、莫斯科和列宁格勒芭蕾舞蹈团等。同时，在“梅费尔”电影院放映了苏联宽银幕全景影片“我们祖国多么辽阔广大”和“魔镜”。有数万美国观众观看了电影和表演。
    在整个展览会展出过程中，美国观众对苏联人民的生活一直怀着极其浓厚的兴趣，许多人在和展览会工作人员交谈时，详细地询问了苏联人如何劳动、学习和休息，对这些问题的回答常常使他们吃惊，并引起他们的称羡。许多人都说，你们的展览会打开了我们的眼界，把你们国家的真实情况告诉了我们。在看到所有这些展品后，我们不可能相信美国报纸所宣传的苏联具有侵略的企图。
    美国报纸对苏联展览会有很高的评价，“纽约先驱论坛报”在一篇编辑部的文章中写道，参观苏联展览会的观众（他们的数目在一百万以上）许多人都认为，这的确是一个有趣的，使人留下很深印象的展览会。美国“布兰肯希普、格鲁诺和奥斯特伯恩”公司曾经进行了一次民意测验，在参加测验的六百五十个人中，有79％的人认为“展览会给他们留下了良好的印象”，83％的人希望这个展览会能到坡士顿、费城和旧金山等城市展出，74％的人赞成明年在纽约举行同样的展览。
    展览会总指导曼茹洛在向美国和外国新闻记者发表的声明中强调指出，苏美两国互相举办展览会有助于增强两国彼此信任的气氛。许多普通的美国人在观众留言簿上或者来信中也都提到这一点，这说明，美国人民和苏联人民一样，希望生活在和平的环境中。（附图片）
