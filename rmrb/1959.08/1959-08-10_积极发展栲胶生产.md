    Actively Develop Quebracho Extract Production
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Quebracho extract is an indispensable raw material in industry. In the leather-making industry, about 0.8 tons of quebracho extract are needed for every ton of heavy leather produced (for things like belt pulleys and leather rollers), and heavy leather is needed in both light and heavy industries. The development of fisheries is very closely related to national construction and the people's lives, and fishing nets must be treated with quebracho extract to be strong and durable. Quebracho extract can also be used as a water softener for locomotives and industrial boilers. The petroleum industry and the chemical industry also need it. With the progress of science, the development of industrial and agricultural production, and the improvement of people's lives, the use of quebracho extract is becoming more and more widespread, the amount used is becoming larger and larger, and its role in the national economy is becoming more and more important.

    In recent years, the development of quebracho extract production in our country has been very rapid. Compared with 1952, the output in 1958 has increased by nearly six times. However, due to the very rapid increase in demand, quebracho extract cannot yet fully meet needs, and quebracho extract production must be further developed.

    Can the development of quebracho extract production be further accelerated? Yes. Our country has many favorable conditions for developing quebracho extract production. First of all, the resources are very rich. Various tannin-bearing plants grow widely in our country's forest areas and plains, with large yields and many varieties, most of which have a high tannin content and great utilization value. According to preliminary calculations, the acorn shells removed from seeds collected in various places in September and October each year can produce 60,000 to 70,000 tons of quebracho extract. The bark of larch, spruce, and fir trees, which are heavily felled in the main forest areas of Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Southwest China every year, are also excellent raw materials for quebracho extract; moreover, obtaining these raw materials only requires appropriate arrangements in conjunction with production, and does not require much labor or time. Furthermore, from the production point of view, our country has established some quebracho extract factories with better equipment in recent years, with a certain production capacity; various places have also widely established many small-scale quebracho extract factories using indigenous methods, and these small-scale quebracho extract factories have accumulated a lot of experience from production practice and have also cultivated a certain amount of technical strength. The all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in the People's Communes and the development of diversified operations provide extremely favorable conditions for the development of quebracho extract production. Therefore, as long as the local mountainous and forest area Party committees strengthen specific leadership over quebracho extract production, make full use of these favorable conditions, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses and the capabilities of existing enterprises, quebracho extract production can be greatly increased.

    To vigorously increase quebracho extract production, it is necessary to seize two important links: one is to grasp production tightly, and the other is to grasp capital construction tightly. In grasping production tightly, the first priority is to focus on grasping the production and distribution of raw materials. The production of quebracho extract raw materials is seasonal, and the production seasons of various quebracho extract raw materials vary from region to region. Therefore, to grasp the production of quebracho extract raw materials, it is necessary to grasp their production seasons. For example, the oak cups (i.e., the outer shells of broad-leaved tree seeds of the cupuliferae family, including many tree species), which are widely used as raw materials in various places, mature in autumn. After maturity, they must be collected in time, otherwise the tannin will dissolve and be lost after falling to the ground and becoming damp. This requires various places to seize favorable opportunities, arrange labor, and launch surprise production in conjunction with gaps in agricultural production. The collection of other raw materials should also be done in this way. Many areas, by seizing the production season of quebracho extract raw materials and appropriately arranging labor, have achieved great results with less labor without affecting agricultural production. In order not to affect the growth of trees and damage forest resources, various places must also pay attention to the characteristics of various raw materials and closely combine forest felling, charcoal production, and forest tending management to collect quebracho extract raw materials. In order to continuously supply high-quality quebracho extract raw materials with high tannin content and purity, in addition to making full use of the quebracho extract raw materials that have already been discovered, we should further investigate raw material resources, try to expand the use of various tree leaves, fruit shells, and herbaceous plants containing tannin that are inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The forestry department should also actively introduce and cultivate fast-growing, high-quality quebracho extract raw materials on a large scale.

    The purchase, transfer, and transportation of quebracho extract raw materials are also very important. If the purchase, transfer, and transportation work cannot keep up, even if there are many raw materials, production needs cannot be met in time. In the purchase, transfer, and transportation work, in addition to seizing the season, purchasing and transferring in time, it is also necessary to grasp the purchase price according to the actual situation, and do a good job in the storage and safekeeping of raw materials to prevent the disappearance of tannin. In the distribution of raw materials, the principle of guaranteeing key points and taking care of the general should be implemented. First of all, ensure that the modernized quebracho extract factories are "well-fed" in order to give full play to the capacity of existing production equipment. Secondly, reserve enough raw materials for the factories that will be built and put into production this winter and next spring. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for the raw materials needed by small-scale factories using indigenous methods. As for the producing areas where the quebracho extract processing capacity is still small but the resources are relatively large, they should also actively organize the production of raw materials and support the use of neighboring provinces (regions) in the spirit of the whole country as a chessboard. This is not only beneficial to the country, but also increases the income of the commune, which is also beneficial to the commune members.

    In grasping production, it is also necessary to actively mobilize workers to improve technology and tap production potential. Currently, the people of the whole country are carrying out a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. In this movement, modernized quebracho extract factories must carry out technological innovation, strengthen production management, give full play to the capacity of existing equipment, and do everything possible to increase quebracho extract production. Factories using indigenous methods should improve technology, improve product quality, strive to reduce the consumption of raw materials and fuel, reduce production costs, and further consolidate and improve on the original basis.

    Our country's existing quebracho extract production equipment capacity is far from meeting the needs of production development. Actively carrying out the capital construction of quebracho extract production is a fundamental way to increase new production capacity and gradually meet the long-term needs in the future. Therefore, while doing a good job in this year's quebracho extract production, we must also do a good job in the capital construction of quebracho extract production with great efforts. This year's capital construction task of quebracho extract production is very heavy. Currently, we must especially focus on those factories that are under construction and can be built and put into production this winter and next spring. On the premise of ensuring quality and quantity, we must try to speed up the capital construction progress of these factories, train technical personnel, and prepare raw materials, and strive to put them into production ahead of schedule. For the factories that are being planned, we must also actively prepare materials in order to advance construction and accelerate construction progress. The quebracho extract factories planned to be built in 1960 should further do a good job in resource review, site selection, and material planning.

    The central link in doing a good job in quebracho extract production and quebracho extract capital construction is to do a good job in planning and strengthen leadership. Relevant departments in various places should formulate plans for the development of quebracho extract production based on the existing factories and the distribution of resources, in the spirit of centralized management and overall planning, so as to avoid the phenomenon that the newly built factories are decoupled from the supply of raw materials. To further develop quebracho extract production, we must strengthen specific leadership over quebracho extract production and capital construction work, often conduct in-depth inspections, specifically solve problems, and urge all quebracho extract production departments to complete and overfulfill tasks in quantity, quality, on a monthly and ten-day basis, and continuously push quebracho extract production to a new upsurge.

    积极发展栲胶生产
    本报评论员
    栲胶，是工业中不可缺少的原料。在制革工业中，每制一吨重革（皮轮带、皮辊等），大约需要零点八吨栲胶，而重革是轻重工业中都很需要的。发展渔业对国家建设和人民生活的关系很密切，而打鱼的鱼网必须用栲胶浸染才坚固耐用。栲胶还可以作机车、工业用锅炉的软水剂。石油工业、化学工业也都需要它。随着科学的进步，工农业生产的发展和人民生活的提高，栲胶的用途愈来愈广，用量愈来愈大，在国民经济中的作用也越来越重要。
    最近几年来，我国的栲胶生产发展是很快的，如果拿1958年的产量与1952年比较，已经增长了将近六倍。但是由于需要量的增长十分迅速，目前栲胶还不能完全适应需要，必须进一步发展栲胶生产。
    栲胶生产的发展能不能进一步加快速度呢？能。在我国发展栲胶生产具备很多有利条件。首先是资源十分丰富，我国各林区和平原地带普遍生长着各种鞣料植物，产量大、种类多，其中绝大部分都是含单宁量很高、利用价值很大的。据初步计算，仅是每年9、10月间各地采集种子所去掉的橡子壳，就可以生产六、七万吨栲胶。东北、内蒙古、西南等主要林区每年大量采伐下来的落叶松、云杉、冷杉等的树皮，也都是很好的栲胶原料；而且这些原料的取得，只要结合生产作适当的安排，并不需要花费多少劳动力和时间。再从生产方面来看，我国几年来已经建立了一些设备较好的栲胶工厂，有一定的生产能力；各地又普遍建立了许多土法生产的小型栲胶厂，这些小型栲胶厂从生产实践中已经积累了不少经验，也培养了一定的技术力量。人民公社农林牧副渔全面大发展，开展了多种经营，更为发展栲胶生产提供了极为有利的条件。因此，只要各地山区林区党委加强对栲胶生产的具体领导，充分利用这些有利条件，发挥群众的积极性和现有企业的能力，栲胶是可以大量增产的。
    大力增产栲胶需要抓住两个重要环节，一个是要抓紧生产，一个是要抓紧基本建设。在抓紧生产中，首先是要突出地抓紧原料的生产与分配工作。栲胶原料的生产是有季节性的，而各个地区各种栲胶原料的生产季节也不一样。因此，抓栲胶原料生产必须要抓它的生产季节。比如当前各地广泛采用作为原料的橡碗（即壳斗科阔叶树种子的外壳，包括的树种很多），秋天成熟。成熟后，就要及时采集，否则落到地面受潮以后，单宁就会溶解流失。这就要求各地抓紧有利时机，安排好劳力，结合农业生产的间隙突击生产。对于其它原料的采集也应该如此。不少地区由于抓紧栲胶原料的生产季节，适当安排好劳动力，在不影响农业生产的情况下，都曾用较少的劳力取得了巨大的效果。为了不致影响树木生长和破坏森林资源，各地还必须注意各种原料的特性，密切结合森林采伐、木炭生产以及森林的抚育管理来收集栲胶原料。为源源不断地供应单宁含量高、纯度大的优良栲胶原料，除了充分利用目前已经发现的栲胶原料外，还应当进一步摸清原料资源，尽量扩大利用并寻求取之不尽、用之不竭的各种树叶、果壳以及含有单宁的草本植物。林业部门也应该积极地引种和大量栽培营造速生优质的栲胶原料。
    栲胶原料的收购调运工作也是很重要的。如果收购调运工作跟不上去，即使原料很多，也不能及时满足生产需要。在收购调运工作中除了要抓住季节，及时收购及时调运以外，还要根据实际情况，掌握好收购价格，作好原料的贮存和保管，以防止单宁的消失。在原料的分配上应该贯彻保证重点照顾一般的原则。首先保证现代化的栲胶厂“吃饱”，以充分发挥现有生产设备能力。其次要为今冬明春就要建成投入生产的厂子储备足够的原料。对于小型土法生产的厂子需要的原料，也要作适当安排。至于目前烤胶加工能力尚小而资源较多的产区，也应本着全国一盘棋的精神，积极组织原料生产，支援邻近省（区）使用。这样做，不仅对国家有利，而且能够增加公社收入，对公社社员群众也是有利的。
    在抓生产中，还要积极发动职工提高技术，挖掘生产潜力。当前全国人民正在开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，现代化的栲胶厂在这个运动中，要大搞技术革新，加强生产管理，充分发挥现有设备的能力，千方百计增产烤胶。土法生产的厂子则应改进技术，提高产品质量，努力降低原料、燃料的消耗，降低生产成本，在原有的基础上进一步巩固提高。
    我国现有的栲胶生产设备能力还远远不能满足生产发展需要。积极进行栲胶生产的基本建设是增加新的生产能力，逐渐满足今后长远需要的根本方法。因此，在搞好今年栲胶生产的同时，还必须以极大的努力搞好栲胶生产的基本建设工作。今年栲胶生产的基本建设任务很大，当前要特别抓紧那些正在施工并于今冬明春就可以建成投入生产的工厂，在保质保量的前提下，要尽量加快这些工厂的基本建设进度，培训技术力量，作好原料准备工作，争取提前投入生产。对于正在筹建的厂子，也要积极准备物资，以便提前施工和加快施工进度。计划于1960筹建的栲胶厂要进一步做好资源复查，厂址选择以及物资筹划工作。
    做好栲胶生产和栲胶基本建设工作的中心环节是做好规划工作和加强领导。各地有关部门应该根据现有工厂、资源分布情况，本着归口管理、统筹安排的精神，作出发展栲胶生产的规划，避免发生新建厂与原料供应相互脱节的现象。要进一步发展栲胶生产，必须加强对栲胶生产和基本建设工作的具体领导，要经常深入检查工作，具体解决问题，督促各个栲胶生产部门按量、按质、按月、按旬完成和超额完成任务，将栲胶生产不断推向新的高潮。
