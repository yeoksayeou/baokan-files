This newspaper article reports the following:

　　
    From our Wuhan dispatch on the 11th: At a critical juncture in the fight against drought, Yingshan County, Hubei Province, eliminated the pessimistic, war-weary, and other right-leaning sentiments of a few cadres and masses through a nationwide debate on "To Save or To Abandon?" This further established the idea of "Fighting to the end and ensuring a bumper harvest," enabling the county's fight against drought to continuously achieve new victories.

    Yingshan County's 490,000 mu of mid-season rice (accounting for 95% of the county's total rice area) are now flowering and heading, promising a bumper harvest. The county's 150,000-strong anti-drought army is in high spirits, fighting hard, and determined to "Ensure every plot is protected, and every seedling is saved!" However, some cadres and masses lost confidence in the face of difficulties, generating pessimistic and war-weary sentiments. Some advocated shrinking the anti-drought front, promoting "abandoning three out of ten," "eliminating four and keeping six," and "saving the near and abandoning the far." Others believed that water sources were exhausted, efforts had been exhausted, and there was no hope of further resistance. Still others said, "A long drought must be followed by a long rain," advocating reliance on heaven. The broad masses and most cadres resolutely opposed these right-leaning manifestations of pre-battle cowardice and surrender to difficulties. Everyone believed that as long as they could persevere for another ten days, overcome all difficulties, and irrigate the rice paddies with one or two meals of water, they could ensure a bumper harvest. Thus, the struggle between two ideas arose: "To Abandon or To Save?"

    In response to this situation, the Yingshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately called on all Party members and non-Party members, from top to bottom, to launch a nationwide debate: "Is it better to try our best to rescue, or to blindly abandon? Is it better to struggle for ten days and be happy for a year, or to be discouraged for ten days and suffer for a year?" This was to overcome right-leaning ideas and ensure the victory of the fight against drought. This great debate invigorated some previously negative and pessimistic cadres and masses. It made those who were already fighting with high morale even more active, setting off a new upsurge in the county's anti-drought struggle.

    The Quan Shui Production Team of Maping Commune has 2,230 mu of rice, of which 1,730 mu were affected by drought. Chen Shicheng, the Party Branch Secretary, developed a sense of retreat when he saw this situation. He told his superiors, "At most, we can only guarantee a harvest of 800 mu!" His superiors asked him to consult with the masses before drawing a conclusion. When Chen Shicheng returned to the production team and announced his plan to the masses, he was immediately met with opposition, and everyone began to argue on the spot. Commune member Peng Ming'an said, "Now is the time when a ladle of water is worth a bowl of grain. Wherever water is poured, grain is harvested. The crops are so good this year, you're asking us to retreat. We won't be reconciled even if we die!" As a result of the debate, everyone opposed abandonment, and the opinion of resolutely resisting drought and protecting seedlings prevailed. Many people also offered suggestions, proposing methods such as finding water sources, building dams to block rivers, digging ditches and canals, digging wells and ponds, diverting water up the mountains, and adjusting water usage. As a result, Chen Shicheng went from sadness to joy, immediately made a self-criticism, and actively led the fight against drought. Within two days, the production team built two river dams and dug three spring eyes, increasing the number of waterwheels from 28 to 70, and the anti-drought labor force from 300 to 760. The rice paddies that were originally intended to be abandoned were universally irrigated. After the great debate in Chengang Commune, the masses unanimously expressed their determination to "Fight to the end and protect to the end!" They also voluntarily prepared anti-drought materials, and vowed not to retreat until the drought was defeated.

    In the days following the debate, countless dams were built on more than 500 rivers and streams throughout the county. In the Huan River alone, 50,000 people were mobilized to build more than 1,500 river dams, setting up 3,600 waterwheels and 10 pumps, irrigating more than 45,000 mu of farmland. In addition, 29 channels, totaling more than 200 li in length, were opened from the county's 12 large reservoirs, irrigating 35,300 mu of rice paddies by gravity flow. In the fight against drought, 250 "Five-Good" cadres emerged throughout the county, and 1,200 old peasant advisory groups were established.

    Currently, the county's fight against drought is advancing victoriously. The county's anti-drought army is determined not only to ensure a bumper harvest of rice, but also to ensure a bumper harvest of cotton and oil crops.

### 一场辩论扫除了松劲情绪　应山掀起抗旱斗争新高潮

　　一场辩论扫除了松劲情绪
　　应山掀起抗旱斗争新高潮
    本报武汉11日电　湖北省应山县在抗旱紧要关头，通过“是救，还是丢？”的全民性大辩论，消除了少数干部和群众的悲观、厌战等右倾情绪，进一步树立了“抗到底，保丰收”的思想，使全县的抗旱斗争不断获得新的胜利。
    应山县四十九万亩中稻（占全县水稻总面积95％）已扬花抽穗，丰收在望，抗旱斗争进入了“瓢水碗谷争丰收”的紧要关头。全县十五万抗旱大军斗志昂扬，奋力苦战，决心要使“块块田必保，棵棵苗得救！”但是，有少数干部和群众在困难面前丧失了信心，产生了悲观、厌战情绪，有的主张收缩抗旱阵地，提倡“收七丢三”、“除四留六”、“救近丢远”；有的认为水源已竭，力气使尽，没有抗头了；也有人说“久晴必有久雨”，主张靠天。广大群众和多数干部坚决反对这些临阵胆怯、向困难低头的右倾表现，大家认为，只要能再坚持十天，排除万难，给稻田灌一两餐水，就能确保丰收。于是，产生了
  “是丢，还是救？”两种思想的斗争。
    针对这种情况，中共应山县委立即号召党内党外、上上下下展开一场全民性的大辩论：“是尽力抢救好，还是盲目丢弃好？是苦战十天幸福一年好，还是泄气十天痛苦一年好？”以克服右倾思想，确保抗旱斗争的胜利。这场大辩论，使得一些原来消极悲观的干部和群众，鼓起了干劲；原来斗志昂扬的人们，更加积极了，全县抗旱斗争掀起新的高潮。
    马坪公社泉水生产队二千二百三十亩水稻，有一千七百三十亩受了旱。党支部书记陈世诚看到这种情况，就产生了退缩情绪。他向上级说：“顶多只能保收八百亩了！”上级叫他和群众商量后再作结论。陈世诚回到生产队，刚把自己的打算向群众宣布，立即遭到反对，大家当场争辩起来。社员彭明安说：“现在正是瓢水碗谷的时刻，水灌到哪里，谷子就收到哪里，今年庄稼这样好，你叫我们打退堂鼓，死也不甘心！”辩论结果，大家都反对丢弃，坚决抗旱保苗的意见占了上风。许多人还纷纷献计，提出了找水源、拦河筑坝、开沟渠、挖井塘、引水上山、调剂用水等办法。这样一来，陈世诚由悲变喜，立刻作了自我批评，积极领导抗旱斗争。两天之内，这个生产队筑了两道拦河坝，挖了三个泉眼，使水车由二十八部增加到七十部，抗旱劳力由三百人增加到七百六十人，原来打算丢弃的稻田普遍灌了水。陈港公社在大辩论后，群众一致表示要“抗到底，保到头！”他们还自动准备了抗旱物资，不把旱灾打退，决不收兵。
    辩论后几天之内，全县五百多条大小河溪里筑起了无数拦河坝。仅澴水一条河里，就有五万人上阵，筑河坝一千五百多处，架上水车三千六百乘、抽水机十部，车水灌田四万五千多亩。另外，全县十二个大型水库开渠道二十九条，共长二百多里，自流灌溉了三万五千三百多亩稻田。在抗旱斗争中，全县还涌现出“五好”干部二百五十名，成立了老农顾问组一千二百个。
    目前，这个县的抗旱斗争正在乘胜前进。全县抗旱大军下定决心：不仅要确保水稻丰收，还要确保棉花、油料作物的丰收。
