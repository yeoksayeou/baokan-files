Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 11th: The Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a national coal mine mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance meeting in Tianjin. The meeting decided to mobilize the coal mine machinery manufacturing plants, repair shops, and all mechanical and electrical workers—extremely important departments in coal production—to continue to exert their utmost effort and focus on the third quarter, especially August and September, to rush production of spare parts, strengthen maintenance and management, ensure the safe operation of mechanical and electrical equipment, and guarantee the overfulfillment of the annual coal production tasks.

In the first half of this year, coal mines across the country promoted rapid repair experiences, actively mobilized the masses to save raw materials, and implemented the driver responsibility system and the "three guarantees" system (guarantee usage, guarantee repair, guarantee maintenance). These measures have played a significant role in ensuring the safe operation of equipment and normal production. The Jiaohe Coal Mine, by strengthening maintenance organization and ensuring the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment, has now fully mechanized all coal extraction and transportation at the mining face. The utilization rate of coal cutting machines is 18.57% higher than the national average. Thanks to good repair work, the mine has eliminated major equipment damage accidents. After the Datong Baidong Coal Mine established a regional management system for mechanical and electrical equipment, the maintenance of machinery was strengthened, eliminating overload operation. It also clarified the inventory and responsibilities, eliminating equipment loss and damage. Coal mines in Hebei, Shandong, and other places, in conjunction with the increase production and practice economy movement, mobilized the masses to clean up warehouses, finding many urgently needed equipment and materials, proving that there is great potential to be tapped in equipment and materials. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously stated that they would further promote these experiences.

The meeting formulated measures to strengthen the maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment in the future. The Ministry of Coal Industry has established a special Coal Mine Equipment and Materials Office, and the coal management bureaus and mining bureaus in each province will also establish corresponding institutions to further solve the supply and manufacturing problems of equipment and materials. Each mining bureau and mine must have a separate mechanical and electrical management organization, so that the operation and maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment are the responsibility of dedicated personnel. It is necessary to establish and improve the necessary mechanical and electrical regulations and systems, especially the maintenance and management systems for mechanical and electrical equipment. The masses should be mobilized to collect scattered and unused equipment, materials, and waste products from both above and below ground in the mines. Units that have not yet cleaned up their warehouses must complete the cleanup before October. Units that have already cleared their warehouses should organize balancing and adjustment to make the equipment complete and the materials as usable as possible, and establish systems to prevent waste of equipment and materials. A general "three checks" should be conducted on mechanical and electrical equipment: check the quantity, check the damage, and check the load. After the checks, technical appraisal opinions should be proposed. Equipment that needs repair should be repaired, and machines exceeding their load limits should not be allowed to operate without approval. Repair shops should focus on repair and fitting, and only use extra capacity for manufacturing. Generally, materials used for repair and fitting should not be diverted for other purposes. Mechanical manufacturing plants and repair shops in various regions should cooperate with each other to rush production of spare parts and support repair work. Each mine can use technical training classes and other forms to train all new drivers in batches and phases. It is required that 70% of them be trained by October 1st, and all of them be trained by the end of the year. New drivers must pass an examination before they are allowed to operate machines. Mechanical and electrical common sense education should also be conducted among all employees to ensure the safe operation of equipment.

　　煤炭工业部召开机电设备维修会议
　　保证采掘工人武器精良
    据新华社天津11日电　煤炭工业部最近在天津召开全国煤矿机电设备维修会议，决定动员煤炭生产中极重要的部门——煤矿机械制造厂、机修厂和煤矿全体机电职工，继续鼓足干劲，狠抓第三季度，特别是8、9月份，赶制配件，加强维修和管理工作，使机电设备安全运转，保证全年煤炭生产任务的超额完成。
    今年上半年，全国各地煤矿推广快速检修经验，积极发动群众节约原料材料，推行司机专责制、三包制（包用、包修、包维护）等，对保证设备安全运转和正常生产都起了很大作用。蛟河煤矿由于加强检修组织，保证机电设备的正常运转，现在全矿回采工作面掏槽、运煤已经全部机械化，截煤机的采掘利用率比全国平均水平高18.57％；由于检修工作作得好，全矿已经消灭了重大设备损坏事故。大同白洞煤矿建立机电设备区域管理制度后，机械维护保养工作加强，消除了超负荷运转现象，并且作到家底清楚，责任明确，消除了设备丢失损坏现象。河北、山东等地煤矿结合增产节约运动，发动群众清理仓库，找到许多急需的设备材料，证明设备材料大有潜力可挖。到会代表一致表示要进一步推广这些经验。
    这次会议制订了今后加强机电设备维修工作的措施。煤炭工业部已经成立专门的煤矿设备材料办公室，各省煤炭管理局、矿务局也要成立相应的机构，进一步解决设备材料的供应和制造问题。每个矿务局、矿必须有单独的机电管理机构，使机电设备、运转、维修工作有专人负责。要建立和健全必要的机电规程制度，特别是机电设备的检修制度和管理制度。矿井上下分散不用的设备、材料和废品要发动群众拣回；还没有清理仓库的单位，必须在10月前清理完毕；已经清仓的单位，要组织平衡调剂，使设备成套、材料尽量利用起来，并且建立制度杜绝设备材料方面的浪费。机电设备要普遍进行三查：查数量、查损坏情况、查负荷，查后提出技术鉴定意见，该修的修，超过负荷的机器不经批准不准运转。机修厂要以修配为主，有多余能力才用作制造，一般不准挪用修配用的材料。各地机械制造厂和机修厂要互相协作，赶制配件，支援修配工作。各矿可以运用技术训练班等形式，分批分期地把所有新司机培训一遍，要求10月1日前培训出70％，年底全部培训完毕。新司机要经过考试合格才准操纵机器、在全体职工中，也要进行机电常识教育，保证设备安全运转。
