    Utilizing Factory By-Products to Increase Raw Materials for Small Factories
    Over One Hundred Small Factories in Harbin Producing Daily Necessities are Linked to Large Factories
    The First Automobile Factory Allocates 1,300 Tons of Waste Materials to Support Increased Production in Small Factories

    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 20th dispatch) Recently, large and medium-sized factories in Harbin allocated a large amount of by-products and waste materials to supply local small factories. These industrial and handicraft units producing daily industrial products have greatly improved their raw material shortages due to the active support of large factories.

    The raw materials needed by small factories in Harbin producing daily industrial products rely partly on state allocation, and partly on by-products and waste materials supplied by large and medium-sized factories. For example, in 1957, small factories in the city producing daily industrial products utilized by-products and waste materials from large and medium-sized factories, accounting for 82.6% of their raw materials. In the first half of 1958, twelve factories producing daily industrial products used more than 3,200 tons of by-products and waste materials. However, since the Great Leap Forward last year, due to the heavy tasks of large factories, many by-products and waste materials were either returned to the furnace for steelmaking or processed for self-use. This cooperative relationship between large factories supplying small factories was once interrupted. After discovering this problem, the relevant leadership departments in Harbin immediately took measures to restore and adjust this cooperative relationship. At present, most of the 190 small factories in the city producing daily industrial products have resumed their supply and demand relationship with large factories. Within a short period of time, large and medium-sized factories have allocated a total of 6,500 tons of by-products and waste materials to small factories.

    This practice of large factories supporting small factories with scraps and leftover materials has had a good effect on actively developing the production of daily industrial products. For example, Harbin Jincheng Hardware Factory used more than 500 tons of by-products and waste materials supplied by Harbin Electric Machinery Factory to restore and produce more than 30 kinds of daily necessities such as coat fasteners, shoe eyelets, pant hooks, and hair clips; Hongqi Hardware and Plastics Factory is linked to Harbin Steel Rolling Factory, using more than 100 tons of iron scraps supported by the steel rolling factory as raw materials, which greatly increased the variety and output of lamp holders, switches, and plugs produced in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year; Songbin Tool Factory received assistance of more than 300 tons of scrap iron rolled from Harbin Railway Bureau Engineering Machinery Factory, and produced 100,000 key hoes, 10,000 kitchen knives, and a large number of Peking-style hand ladles, scissors, and other products.

    Large and medium-sized factories in processing industries such as machinery and steel rolling will have a large amount of by-products and waste materials left over every day. For large factories, these scraps and leftover materials are not very useful. However, if they are allocated to local factories producing daily industrial products, they can be made into products. Taking Harbin Electric Machinery Factory as an example, the factory took out one ton of by-products and waste materials, but Jincheng Hardware Factory produced hundreds of thousands of pant hooks. In order to make the original supply relationship of by-products and waste materials between large and medium-sized factories and local small factories producing daily industrial products more planned, more organized, and more consolidated, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to the local, municipal, and county committees and factory party committees in early July, requiring large and medium-sized factories to sort out and report a part of the by-products, waste materials, and defective products that they cannot directly use, and uniformly allocate them to factories producing daily industrial products by material departments at all levels. Then, in production, gradually sign cooperation and linkage contracts to establish normal cooperative relations between large and small factories. At present, according to the statistics of only nineteen factories in Harbin, such as boiler, electric machinery, steam turbine, and Longjiang Electric, about 3,000 tons of by-products and waste materials can still be transferred out in the third and fourth quarters.

    (Our newspaper) Changchun First Automobile Factory uses the scraps and leftover materials left over from the factory's automobile production to support more than 120 small factories in Changchun City to develop various accessories and small daily commodities production to supply the needs of production and construction and people's lives.

    On the one hand, the staff and workers of the First Automobile Factory try every possible means to find sources of raw materials, and use raw materials sparingly and carefully in production. Workers pick out any scraps that can be used at any time and reprocess them into various small parts. Generally, steel scraps that cannot be directly used are also collected and used as furnace charge. On the other hand, a large part of the scraps and leftover materials remaining from the production of automobiles are used to support small factories to solve the shortage of raw materials. According to incomplete statistics, in the past seven months or so, the automobile factory supplied more than 1,300 tons of steel scraps, old wood, and waste sulfuric acid to small factories such as mechanical factories, small hardware factories, chemical factories, woodworking factories, and sheet metal cooperatives in Changchun City.

    Most of these small factories have cooperative relations with the automobile factory. Through direct linkage, a small number of factories have also received support from the automobile factory with the assistance of relevant departments in Changchun City. From January to July, Changchun Automobile Parts Factory used more than 150 tons of scraps and leftover materials from the automobile factory. In addition to supplying the automobile factory with 12,000 sets of rear lights, rear turn signal lights and other accessories, it also produced more than 100,000 automobile accessories of thirteen types (80% using scraps and leftover materials) to supply the needs of automobile repair shops across the country. Changchun Automobile Switch Factory used more than 20 tons of scraps from the automobile factory to produce more than 10,000 sets of automobile switches in seven months to supply the automobile factory, and also supplied more than 10,000 pieces to the market. More than one-tenth of the raw materials for the 900 bicycles and more than 40,000 wheelbarrows produced by Changchun Bicycle Factory in seven months are scraps from the automobile factory. For example, the round iron block pressed down by the automobile factory for processing automobile beams is just right for making the axle bowl of the wheelbarrow, which is both labor-saving and guarantees quality. Bayi Primary School Hardware Factory used the automobile factory's rolled scraps, small steel heads, and pipe heads to produce more than 400,000 pieces of small hardware products such as hinges, latches, triangles, handles, and door buckles in seven months, and also produced four kinds of small commodities that the market urgently needs, and there are more than 800,000 shoe fasteners alone. Other factories use scraps from the automobile factory to produce various tools, mechanical equipment parts, toys, pesticides, and fertilizers.

    The support of the automobile factory not only promoted the development of local industrial production, but also played a certain role in reducing product costs. Many factories have maintained cooperative and supply relations with the automobile factory for several years. The automobile parts factory established a cooperative relationship with the automobile factory in 1955 and has used hundreds of tons of scraps every year. The 150 tons of scraps used by the automobile parts factory can replace more than 70 tons of whole imported steel plates.

    In order to establish supply relations in a planned and organized manner and more effectively utilize various scraps, the relevant leadership departments in Changchun City are conducting a comprehensive investigation, strengthening leadership, and helping factories and the automobile factory sign long-term supply contracts.

    利用大厂边材　增加小厂原料
    哈尔滨一百多个生产日用品的小厂同大厂挂钩
    第一汽车厂拨出一千三百吨废料支援小厂增产
    本报哈尔滨20日电　哈尔滨市各大中工厂最近调拨了大批边材废料，供应地方小厂。这些生产日用工业品的工业和手工业单位，由于得到了大厂的积极支援，原料材料不足的情况得到了很大的改善。
    哈尔滨市生产日用工业品的小工厂所需用的原料材料，一部分依靠国家调拨，另一部分历来就是依靠大中工厂供应的边材废料。如1957年全市生产日用工业品的小厂，利用大中工厂的边材废料即占其所使用原材料的82.6％。1958年上半年十二个生产日用工业品工厂所用的边材废料即达三千二百多吨。但是，去年大跃进以来，由于大厂任务繁重，许多边材废料，有的回炉炼钢，有的加工自用。这种大厂供应小厂的协作关系，曾一度中断。哈尔滨市有关领导部门在发觉这一问题后，立即采取措施，恢复并调整了这种协作关系。目前，这个市的一百九十个生产日用工业品的小厂，绝大部分已经和大厂恢复了供求关系，在短短的时间内，各个大中工厂调拨给小厂的边材废料，共达六千五百吨。
    这种大厂用边角余料支援小厂的作法，对积极发展日用工业品的生产，已经收到了良好的效果。如哈尔滨金城五金厂用哈尔滨电机厂支援的五百多吨边材废料，恢复和生产了大衣卡、鞋五眼、裤钩子、发卡等三十几种人民日用必需品；红旗五金塑料厂和哈尔滨轧钢厂挂钩，利用轧钢厂支援的一百多吨铁角子作为原料，使上半年生产的灯头、开关、插肖等品种和产量比去年同期产量有了大大的增加；松滨工具厂从哈尔滨铁路局工务机械厂得到三百多吨废铁轧的援助，生产了十万把键镐、一万把菜刀和大批京手勺、剪刀等产品。
    机械、轧钢等加工工业中的大中工厂，在生产中每天都会余下大批的边材废料。对于大厂来说，这些边材余料用场是不大的。但是，如果调拨给地方生产日用工业品的工厂，他们就可以制成产品。以哈尔滨电机厂为例，这个厂拿出了一吨边材废料，金城五金工厂却生产了几十万个裤钩子。为了使大中工厂与地方生产日用工业品的小厂间原有的边材废料供应关系，更有计划、有领导、并巩固起来，中共黑龙江省委已于7月初通知各地、市、县委和各工厂党委，要大中工厂将自己不能直接使用的一部分边材废料和废品分门别类清理上报，并由各级物资部门统一分配给生产日用工业品工厂，然后在生产中，逐步订立协作挂钩合同，建立大小工厂之间正常的协作关系。现在，仅据哈尔滨市的锅炉、电机、汽轮机、龙江电工等十九个工厂的统计，三、四季度仍然可以调出三千吨左右的边材废料。
          （纪静如、王宝馨、吴建民）
    本报讯　长春第一汽车厂用本厂生产汽车剩下的边材余料，支援长春市一百二十多个小工厂，发展各种配件和日用小商品生产，供应生产建设和人民生活的需要。
    第一汽车厂的职工，一方面千方百计地寻找原料材料来源，在生产中精打细算，节约使用原料材料。工人们随时把能够利用的边角余料都挑选出来，再加工成各种小零件。一般不能直接利用的钢铁边材余料，也收集起来，当做炉料。另一方面，又把很大一部分生产汽车剩下的边材余料，支援小工厂解决原料困难。据不完全统计，最近七个多月，汽车厂供应给长春市各机械工厂、小五金厂、化工厂、木器厂、钣金社等小工厂的钢材边角余料、旧木材、废硫酸等一千三百多吨。
    这些小工厂大多数都和汽车厂有协作关系，通过直接挂钩，也有一小部分工厂是经过长春市有关部门协助，得到了汽车厂的支援。长春汽车配件厂从1月到7月，共利用汽车厂一百五十多吨边材余料，除了供应汽车厂一万二千辆份后灯、后转向指示灯等配件，还生产了十三种十多万件汽车配件（80％利用边材余料），供应全国各汽车修理厂的需要。长春汽车开关厂利用汽车厂二十多吨边材，七个月生产一万多辆份汽车开关供应给汽车厂，还供应市场一万多件。长春自行车制造厂七个月生产的九百辆自行车和四万多只手推车轮，有十分之一多的原料，都是利用汽车厂的边角材料。像汽车厂加工汽车大梁压下的圆铁块，正好做手推车的轴碗，既省事又保证质量。八一小学五金厂利用汽车厂的压延边材、小钢头、管子头，七个月生产了四十多万件折页、插销、三角、拉手、门扣等小五金产品，还生产了四种市场急需要的小商品，仅鞋卡子一种就有八十多万个。其他工厂利用汽车厂边材余料生产的东西还有各种工具、机械设备零件、玩具、农药、肥料等。
    汽车厂的支援，不仅促进了地方工业生产的发展，对降低产品成本也起了一定的作用。不少工厂几年来都和汽车厂保持着协作和供应关系。汽车配件厂在1955年就和汽车厂建立协作关系，每年都利用成百吨的边材余料。汽车配件厂利用的一百五十吨边材余料，可以代替七十多吨整张的进口钢板。
    为了有计划有组织地建立供应关系，更有效地利用各种边材余料，长春市有关领导部门正在全面进行调查，加强领导，帮助各厂和汽车厂签订长期的供应合同。
