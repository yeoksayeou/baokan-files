The gurgling Jiushui River glitters with the glow of the setting sun, and rows of dense willow trees form a barrier for the farmland. On the fertile land along the riverbanks, the red flags of the socialist labor competition flutter in the wind, adorning the green fields even more beautifully. Han and Korean members of the Taiyang People's Commune in Yanji County are enthusiastically engaged in a rice transplanting competition. To achieve the best results in a single day, the members are racing against each other and against the setting sun.

On this day, Wang Xianting, a young Han man, and Bai Mingzhe, a young Korean man, from the Third Production Team of the Longsheng Management Area of the Taiyang People's Commune, decided to plant three mu of rice to create a new record. To achieve this goal, Wang Xianting came up with a good idea: to change the "Korean-style" rice planting method (using the index and middle fingers) to the "Han-style" rice planting method (using the thumb). This method of planting is less strenuous, and the stones in the field do not prick the hand, allowing for a fast pace to be maintained for a long time. However, in deep water, the "Korean-style" planting method is more effective. The two of them switched back and forth, alternating between the two methods, and their speed was very fast.

At lunchtime, production team leader Zhao Dayuan announced their record to everyone: they had planted 2.2 mu of land in one morning, planting straight and evenly. Tian Yingxiu, an elderly Han man, listened from the side and exclaimed, "This is truly remarkable!" People cast envious glances at them. Production team leader Zhao Dayuan said, "If you two plant at this speed, it should be no problem to plant 3.5 mu today, right?" Bai Mingzhe, a young Korean man, said, "Okay! I won't leave the field until I finish the task of 3.5 mu, even if it's until morning."

In the afternoon, their hands moved even faster. The members followed them and worked hard. Although the labor was very intense, everyone still talked and laughed, and sang songs. Zhao Shuzan, the leader of the Korean youth shock brigade, led everyone in singing "The Sun is Rising" in Chinese with great interest, and Tian Huijun, a Han girl, sang "The Great Leap Forward Song" in Korean. In this way, they spent a pleasant day. On this day, Wang Xianting and Bai Mingzhe truly created a new record for rice planting through their joint cooperation, planting a total of 4.45 mu, more than double what they usually planted. In the evening, when the two ethnic groups of the production team held a forum in the cafeteria, everyone said that they would learn from them, especially from their spirit of unity, close cooperation, and mutual learning.

The friendship between Wang Xianting, who is in his twenties, and Bai Mingzhe, who is in his thirties, began a long time ago, but it went through a tortuous process before it reached the level of closeness, sharing joys and sorrows, that it has today.

Originally, the two of them got along very well, and Wang Xianting went to Bai Mingzhe's house almost every night to play. In 1957, Bai Mingzhe wanted to learn Chinese from Wang Xianting, and his wife also joined the Han production team. At that time, Wang Xianting was the production team's clerk. One day, Xing Haiyu, a counter-revolutionary element under surveillance, whispered to Bai Mingzhe as if revealing a secret, "You are Korean, and you come to the Han production team to work, you are getting the short end of the stick. Look, Wang Xianting does the clerical work, lowering your work points and recording nine carts for himself when he delivers five carts of fertilizer." Bai Mingzhe didn't take these words to heart at first, but the counter-revolutionary Xing Haiyu fabricated rumors in every possible way, sowing discord and injuring their friendship. Bai Mingzhe began to doubt Wang Xianting's character, and the relationship between the two gradually became estranged, to the point that they not only didn't play together, but also didn't work together. In February 1958, the public security department arrested Xing Haiyu based on reports from the masses, and his crimes of undermining national unity were exposed in a public trial. At this time, the two realized that they had fallen into Xing Haiyu's trap, and the misunderstanding was naturally resolved.

The night after the public trial, Wang Xianting took the initiative to come to Bai Mingzhe's house again, and the two talked about the beginning and end of the breakdown of their relationship, and their friendship became even closer.

    九水河畔传佳话
    吴泰镐
    潺潺的九水河闪耀着夕阳的霞光，一行行茂密的柳林，形成了农田的屏障。在沿河两岸肥沃的土地上，社会主义劳动竞赛的红旗迎风飞舞，把绿色的田野点缀得更加美丽。延吉县太阳人民公社的汉族和朝鲜族社员正热火朝天地展开插秧竞赛。为了取得一天最优异的成绩，社员们正在你追我赶地和夕阳决赛。
    这一天，太阳人民公社龙盛管理区第三生产队的汉族青年王贤廷和朝鲜族青年白明哲，决定以插秧三亩，来创造新的纪录。为了实现这个目标，王贤廷出了个好主意：把“朝鲜族式”的插秧方法（用食指和中指插）改成“汉族式”插秧方法（用大拇指插）。用这个方法插秧不大费劲，田里有石子也不刺手，能长时间保持很快的速度。但是，遇上水深的地方，用“朝鲜族式”插秧方法效果更好。他们两个换来换去交替着使用这两种方法，速度很快。
    吃午饭时，生产队长赵大元向大家宣布了他们两人的纪录：一个上午就插完了二亩二分地，插得又直又匀。汉族田英秀老人在一旁听了，感叹地说：“真是了不起的事！”人们向他俩投以羡慕的目光。生产队长赵大元说：“如果你俩用这个速度插秧，今天插三亩五分没问题吧？”朝鲜族青年白明哲说：“好！不完成三亩五分的任务，到明晨也不离开田。”
    午后，他俩的手更快了。社员们也跟着他们一个劲地赶着。劳动虽然十分紧张，大家还是说说笑笑，唱着歌。朝鲜族青年突击队队长赵寿赞，领着大家，兴致勃勃地用汉语唱起“太阳出来了”，汉族姑娘田慧君又用朝鲜话唱着“大跃进之歌”，就这样，愉快度过了一天。这一天，王贤廷和白明哲在共同合作中真的创造了插秧的新纪录，共插了四亩四分五厘，比平日多插一倍多。晚上，生产队的两族社员在食堂开座谈会时，大家都表示要向他们学习。特别是学习他们团结无间、互相学习的精神。
    今年二十多岁的王贤廷和三十多岁的白明哲两人之间的友谊，在很早以前就开始建立起来，但是他们达到像现在这样亲密、同呼吸共欢乐的程度，却曾经过了一段曲折的过程。
    原来，他俩相处得相当好，王贤廷几乎每天晚上都到白明哲家去玩。1957年，白明哲要跟王贤廷学习汉语，他的爱人也参加到汉族生产队来。那时候，王贤廷是生产队的文书。有一天，受监视的反革命分子邢海玉，好像透露一件秘密一样，轻声细语地对白明哲说：“你是朝鲜族，到汉族生产队来劳动，吃老亏啦。你看，王贤廷做文书工作，把你们的工分压低，自己送肥五车却记上九车”。白明哲听到这些话，起初还没有放在心上，但反革命分子邢海玉百般造谣，挑拨中伤两人的友谊。白明哲也竟对王贤廷的为人产生了怀疑，两人的关系渐渐疏远了，以致不但不一块玩，而且干活也不在一起了。1958年2月，公安部门根据群众的检举，逮捕了邢海玉，在公开审判中揭露了邢海玉破坏民族团结的罪行。这时，两人才知道中了邢海玉的计，误解也就自然解除了。
    开公审大会的第二天晚上，王贤廷又主动来到白明哲的家里，两人讲着过去关系破裂的始末，友情更加亲密了。
