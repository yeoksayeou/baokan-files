Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 5th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement on the current situation in Laos. The full text of the statement is as follows: As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes it is necessary to once again state its position on the current situation in Laos.

    The situation in Laos has been tense for a long time. Recently, this situation has developed to a particularly serious point. The root and direct cause of this situation is the interference of U.S. imperialism. Its purpose is to turn Laos into a military base of U.S. imperialism, directly and seriously threatening the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    As early as the initial stage of the restoration of peace in Indochina, in order to realize the above-mentioned vicious conspiracy, U.S. imperialism tried its best to undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and tried every means to pull Laos into the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Laos blatantly violated Articles 6, 7, and 9 of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos, violated Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and violated the solemn guarantee of the Kingdom of Laos government at the 1954 Geneva Conference, transporting thousands of tons of American weapons and hundreds of American military advisers into Laos, establishing a large number of new military bases on Laotian territory, and constantly provoking in areas close to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government announced the abandonment of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, reneged on its agreement with the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, and attempted to use force to eliminate the two battalions of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, provoking the civil war in Laos.

    Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government colluded closely with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, allowing South Vietnamese officers and spies to use Laotian territory to carry out activities to sabotage the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and used many units of the former Tai ethnic puppet army of the Vietnamese traitor Diao Wenlong to create disturbances in areas close to the Vietnamese border.

    The bilateral agreement between Laos and South Vietnam and the bilateral agreement between Laos and Thailand are all steps taken to realize U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to prepare for war in Southeast Asia. Especially in the French-Laotian joint communique published on July 24, the Sananikone government has actually openly stated the fact that American military advisers and American weapons have been transported into Laos. Subsequently, a large number of new American military personnel and weapons have been and are being transported into Laos. This very serious action grossly violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos and is intensifying preparations to provoke a new war.

    In order to smoothly implement the American war preparation plan, the Sananikone government and the reactionary officers who control the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," after launching the civil war, continue to implement the policy of suppressing and persecuting the patriotic and anti-American Laotian people, arresting and shooting cadres of the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, and continue to seriously violate the agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, under the "anti-communist" banner consistently used by U.S. imperialism.

    In order to expand the civil war and brazenly provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Sananikone government is transferring a large number of troops to the Sam Neua area near the Vietnamese border. On July 28, they openly and illegally arrested many leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, including Prince Souphanouvong, who enjoys great prestige in Laos.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly condemned the above-mentioned violent and dangerous actions of U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government to world opinion, the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Indian government, and the governments of many countries in Southeast Asia. However, U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government continue to implement their arrogant conspiracy to turn Laos into a military base of U.S. imperialism and attempt to pull Laos into the Southeast Asia aggression bloc.

    This is the truth of the situation in Laos. It is U.S. imperialism that is creating this situation. The aggressive and challenging policies of U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and around the world are well known to world opinion. However, this group of people who created the tension in Laos actually slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos' internal affairs and directing armed forces to attack the army of the Kingdom of Laos. This group of people who announced the abandonment of and are seriously violating the Geneva Agreements dare to baselessly slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for disrespecting this agreement. The statement of the Kingdom of Laos government on July 28, 1959, and the statements of the U.S. Department of State on July 30 and August 1, 1959, are all the rhetoric of "a thief crying 'stop thief!'" and "shouting for help while setting fire." They are attempting to reverse black and white, evade responsibility, and cover up the facts.

    Faced with the very serious current situation in Laos, as a party to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighboring country with more than a thousand kilometers of common border with Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns U.S. imperialism for interfering in Laos, turning Laos into a military base, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, undermining peace, and preparing to provoke a new war.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely condemns U.S. imperialism for instigating and assisting the Sananikone government in seriously violating the Geneva Agreements and reneging on the agreements signed between the Kingdom of Laos government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces.

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the actions of the Phoui Sananikone government in writing to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the statement of the Laotian Foreign Minister that Laos will request the protection and support of the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc, are very dangerous provocative actions aimed at paving the way for further U.S. imperialism to interfere in Laos and strengthen American challenging activities. This action may make the situation in Laos even more serious. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares: If the Phoui Sananikone government does not abandon its conspiracy, it must bear full responsibility for the consequences caused by its actions.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence and hopes to establish good-neighborly relations with Laos in accordance with the Bandung spirit and on the basis of mutual respect for the provisions of the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the joint communique signed between the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Government of the Kingdom of Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly expressed its above-mentioned goodwill. In order to safeguard the peace and tranquility of the Vietnamese people, the people of Indochina, and the peoples of Southeast Asia, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the governments of the participating countries, as well as the governments of the member states of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Indochina, to take urgent measures to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos, to promptly stop the challenging actions of U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government, and to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos are strictly and thoroughly implemented.

    越南民主共和国外交部发表声明
    美国制造老挝紧张局势贼喊捉贼
    萨纳尼空政府不放弃阴谋必须对后果负责
    新华社河内5日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部今天就老挝当前局势发表声明。声明全文如下：作为关于老挝的日内瓦协议的签字国和老挝王国的邻邦，越南民主共和国政府认为必须再一次就老挝当前局势表明自己的立场。
    老挝局势很久以来就处于紧张状态。最近这种局势已经发展到特别严重的地步。造成这种局势的根源和直接原因是美帝国主义的干涉。其目的在于把老挝变成美帝国主义的军事基地，直接和严重地威胁越南民主共和国。
    早在印度支那和平恢复初期，美帝国主义为了实现上述恶毒的阴谋，便竭力破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议，千方百计要把老挝拉入东南亚军事侵略集团。美帝国主义和它在老挝的走狗明目张胆地违反了关于老挝停止敌对行动的协议的第六、第七和第九条，违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四和第五条，违背了老挝王国政府在1954年日内瓦会议上的郑重保证，把成千吨美国武器和成百名美国军事顾问运入老挝，在老挝领土上设立大批新的军事基地，在靠近越南民主共和国边界的地区频频不绝地挑衅。在美帝国主义的嗾使下，培·萨纳尼空政府宣布毁弃关于老挝的日内瓦协议，背弃它同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，企图用武力消灭前寮国战斗部队的两个营，挑起了老挝的内战。
    在美帝国主义的指使下，培·萨纳尼空政府同吴庭艳当局紧密地勾结，让南越的军官和间谍利用老挝的领土进行破坏越南民主共和国的活动，并且使用越奸刁文龙的前傣族伪军的许多部队在靠近越南边界地区捣乱。
    老挝同南越之间的双边协定和老挝同泰国之间的双边协定都是为了实现美帝国主义在东南亚备战的阴谋所采取的步骤。尤其是在7月24日发表的法国—老挝联合公报中，萨纳尼空政府实际上已经公开说明了老挝运进美国军事顾问和美国武器的事实。随后，大批新的美国军事人员和武器已经和正在源源运入老挝。这种非常严重的行动，粗暴地破坏了关于老挝的日内瓦协议，是在加紧准备挑起新的战争。
    为了畅行无阻地实行美国的备战计划，萨纳尼空政府和操纵“保卫国家利益委员会”的反动军官们在发动内战后，打着美帝国主义一贯使用的“反共”招牌，继续施行镇压和迫害爱国反美的老挝人民、逮捕和枪杀前寮国战斗部队的干部的政策，继续严重地违反老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议。
    萨纳尼空政府为了扩大内战和放肆地向越南民主共和国挑衅，正在向靠近越南边界的桑怒地区调集大批兵力。7月28日，他们公然非法逮捕了老挝爱国战线党许多领导人，其中有在老挝享有极大威望的苏发努冯亲王。
    越南民主共和国政府曾经多次向世界舆论、日内瓦会议两位主席、印度政府和东南亚许多国家的政府谴责美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府上述暴戾和危险的行为。可是，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府仍然继续实行他们的狂妄的阴谋，把老挝变成美帝国主义的军事基地和企图把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团。
    这就是老挝局势的真象。造成这种局势的正是美帝国主义。而美帝国主义在东南亚、中近东、拉丁美洲和世界各地的侵略和挑战政策早为世界舆论所熟悉了。可是，这班制造老挝紧张局势的人竟然诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政、指挥武装力量攻击老挝王国政府军队。这班宣布废弃和正在严重违反日内瓦协议的人竟敢卑鄙地诬蔑越南民主共和国不尊重这项协议。老挝王国政府1959年7月28日的声明和美国国务院1959年7月30日和8月1日的声明都是“贼喊捉贼”和“边纵火边喊救命”的论调。它们企图颠倒黑白，逃避责任和掩盖事实。
    面对着非常严重的老挝当前局势，作为签订关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方和同老挝有着一千多公里共同边界线的邻国，越南民主共和国严厉谴责美帝国主义干涉老挝，把老挝变成军事基地，威胁越南民主共和国的安全，破坏和平，准备挑起新的战争。
    越南民主共和国政府坚决谴责美帝国主义嗾使和帮助萨纳尼空政府严重违反日内瓦协议，背弃老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议。
    越南民主共和国认为，培·萨纳尼空政府写信给联合国秘书长诬蔑越南民主共和国以及老挝外交大臣宣称老挝将要求东南亚军事侵略集团的保护和支援等行动，是非常危险的挑衅行动，其目的在于为美帝国主义进一步干涉老挝和加强美国的挑战活动开辟道路。这种行动可能使老挝的局势更加严重。越南民主共和国政府声明：如果培·萨纳尼空政府不放弃他的阴谋，它必须对自己的行动所造成的后果负全部责任。
    越南民主共和国政府始终奉行和平共处政策，希望按照万隆精神和在双方共同尊重关于老挝的日内瓦协议各项条款和越南民主共和国政府同老挝王国政府签订的联合公报的基础上，同老挝建立睦邻关系。越南民主共和国政府曾经多次表明了自己的上述善意。为了维护越南人民、印度支那和东南亚各民族人民的和平和安宁，越南民主共和国政府呼吁1954年日内瓦会议两位主席和会议的参与国政府以及印度支那国际监察和监督委员会成员国政府必须采取紧急措施，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，及时制止美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府的挑战行动，保障关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到严格和彻底的履行。
