　　I was deeply moved after reading an article about the patriotic historian Tan Qian in "New Observer". In the seventeenth century, a poor scholar aspired to write history. But he had no money to buy books, nor a library to borrow them from. Relying solely on his own two legs to climb mountains and wade through rivers, his feet blistered, he sought help everywhere, borrowing and copying materials. From his youth until his hair turned white, he finally wrote a book. What is especially noteworthy is that during the working process, the completed initial draft was stolen. But difficulties could not overwhelm a determined person. After crying, Tan Qian started all over again, and finally a chronicle of the Ming Dynasty, "Guo Que," was published!

　　There have been many people like Tan Qian in Chinese history. The working people most respect heroes who are not afraid of difficulties, who work for everyone, and who are selfless. Therefore, the story of Yugong removing mountains has been passed down as a beautiful tale.

　　In the old society, doing good deeds not only failed to receive help from the ruling class but also suffered oppression and even death. Doing good deeds in the new society has a fundamental difference: gaining more support. The entire society, the collective strength, and various favorable conditions are waiting for every worker to utilize. If Tan Qian were fortunate enough to be born today, how happy he would be to see the various superior conditions we have in cultural facilities! How could his "Guo Que" take thirty years to complete?

　　Of course, there are always difficulties; there is no ready-made feast in the world. That only exists in myths. The fundamental transformation of the social system has liberated the productive forces, but creation, invention, labor, and construction still require the full development of subjective strength. As the old saying goes, everything is ready except for the east wind. But even with the east wind, you still can't win the battle if you don't prepare everything first. It is bound to fail if the objective situation does not permit it and you act blindly. If the objective situation permits it, but you shrink back from difficulties, then even if the east wind blows fiercely, it will still not burn Cao Cao's ships.

　　News from Shanghai reports that old worker Pan Ayao repeatedly reformed tools, increasing the output of the perforating machine by more than seven times. He and his comrades are still continuing to study and prepare to create even greater achievements to welcome the 10th anniversary of National Day. The factory where Pan Ayao works is not large in scale or advanced in equipment; it is a simple and dilapidated place. But since liberation, he has been working hard, practically, and skillfully. In 1950, he was elected as a national model worker. Without knowing many characters and without readily available technical information, he invented a method for manufacturing seamless copper tubes through his own hard work. Over the past ten years, he has made continuous efforts and many achievements, developing from manufacturing seamless copper tubes to manufacturing seamless steel tubes. After the Great Leap Forward, he fully tapped the potential of old equipment, used waste materials to innovate equipment, and turned "old-fashioned" machines into automatic ones, continuously improving labor productivity. His revolutionary spirit has motivated all the workers, and his factory has become one of the eight red banners in Shanghai. There are many heroic figures like Pan Ayao in the country. Their common characteristic is that they fully utilize the existing conditions, strive to develop subjective strength, and complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned by the state. If conditions are insufficient, they will work hard to create conditions, overcome all difficulties, and achieve victory! Only those who are frightened by difficulties, who are misled by temporary, local, specific, or superficial phenomena, who abandon the scientific analysis of the essence of the general situation, and who therefore slacken and lose heart, will waste their time and achieve nothing.

　　If Pan Ayao had been born in Tan Qian's era, we cannot be certain that he would have made no contribution to society at all; maybe he could have made a few reforms to a certain production tool. But what can be determined is that the Pan Ayao living today is bound to make a great contribution to the country. What guided Tan Qian was a certain simple and upright view of life, while what leads Pan Ayao and others forward is the great communist ideology! Speaking of conditions, this is the most fundamental and most favorable condition. With it, we can be invincible. A surging tide of the vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy is unfolding. Let us dedicate ourselves to various production and construction fronts, raise thousands of oars together, surge forward, and work like Tan Qian and Pan Ayao!

    万棹齐发，鼓浪前进
    山柏
    在“新观察”上读到一篇介绍爱国的历史家谈迁的文章，很受感动。十七世纪有位穷秀才立志修史。可是一无钱买不起书，二无图书馆，可以借书。只靠自己两条腿登山涉水，脚磨起了泡，到处求人，借抄材料，从青年时起一直干到白发年迈，才写成一部书。尤其值得注意的是，在工作过程中，完成了的初稿曾被人偷走，可是困难压不倒有心人，谈迁哭了一场之后，又从头干起，终于一部明朝编年史“国榷”，得以问世！
    我国历史上像谈迁这样的人，是不少的。劳动人民最敬重的就是这种不怕困难，为大家办事，奋不顾身的英雄。因此，愚公移山的故事传为美谈。
    在旧社会里做好事，非但得不到统治阶级的帮助，而且还要横遭压迫，甚至杀身延祸。在新社会里做好事，就有个根本不同之处，得道多助。整个社会，集体的力量，各种有利条件，在等待着每一个劳动者去运用。如果谈迁幸而生在今天，当他看到我们在文化设施方面的种种优越条件，他将怎样高兴啊！他的“国榷”何用三十年才完成？
    当然，困难总是有的，天下决无现成的筵席。那只有在神话里才有。社会制度的根本变革解放了生产力，可是创造发明，劳动建设，总还是要充分发挥主观的力量。老话说，万事齐备，只欠东风。可是光有东风，自己不先去把万事备齐，也还是打不赢仗。客观情况根本不许可，而盲目胡来，固然要失败；客观情况许可，而畏难却步，那末东风尽管刮得猛，也还是烧不了曹营的船的。
    上海传来消息，老工人潘阿耀反复数次改革工具，使穿孔机提高了产量七倍多。目前他还在继续和同志们一起钻研，准备创造更大的成绩来迎接国庆十周年。潘阿耀所在的工厂谈不上规模宏大，设备先进，是一个简陋破烂的摊子。可是他从解放以来，一直实干苦干巧干。1950年就当选为全国劳模。没有识得多少字，也并无现成的技术资料，就凭自己艰苦奋斗，发明了制造无缝铜管的方法。十年来他不断努力，多所建树，从制造无缝铜管发展到制造无缝钢管。大跃进以后，他充分挖掘旧设备潜力，利用废旧料革新设备，更使“老爷”的机器，变成自动化，不断提高劳动生产率。他的革命精神带动了全体工人，他的厂已成为上海市八面红旗之一。全国像潘阿耀那样的英雄人物是很多的。他们共同的特点是充分利用现有的条件，努力发挥主观力量，去完成并超额完成国家的任务。条件不足，他们还要努力创造条件，百折不挠，取得胜利！只有那种被困难吓倒，被一时一地一事或表面的现象所迷惑，抛弃了对一般情况的实质作科学分析，因而松劲泄气的人，才会虚度光阴，一事无成。
    如果潘阿耀生在谈迁的时代，我们固然不能断定他对社会会一点贡献也没有，说不定他也能对某件生产工具进行少许改革。但是可以断定的是，活在今天的潘阿耀，是必然会对国家做出很大贡献来的。支配谈迁的是某种朴素的正直的人生观，而领导着潘阿耀们前进的是伟大的共产主义思想！要说条件，这就是最根本最有利的一个条件，有了它，我们便能无往而不胜。一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动的高潮正在掀起，让我们在各个生产建设战线上大献身手，万棹齐发，鼓浪前进，像谈迁和潘阿耀那样干起来吧！
