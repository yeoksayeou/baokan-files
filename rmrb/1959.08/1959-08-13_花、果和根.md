    Flowers, Fruits, and Roots

    Soil science workers in Guangdong Province held a discussion to study the achievements of mass soil science activities and professional scientific research. Soil experts, both local and professional, in Shanxi Province gathered to discuss major drought resistance plans. The combination of "local experts" from the masses and professional scientific workers, and the connection of experience from production practice with theoretical knowledge, have blossomed into brilliant flowers.

    Please see: After discussion, the soil science workers in Guangdong have many new and different understandings on the full utilization of land resources, soil improvement, and the continuous improvement of soil fertility, etc. The local and professional experts in Shanxi Province have put forward many good ideas for drought resistance. These different methods all have one characteristic: they are closely linked to production reality and are very much in line with local conditions. Although the flowers are of various colors, we can believe that the fruits these flowers bear will be plump and large, bringing a bumper harvest to our production.

    Good flowers and large fruits are all because the roots are deep. What are the roots? It is the principle of linking theory with practice pointed out by the Party. From last year to this year, this root has deeply taken root in the minds of scientific workers, just like solid roots are deeply buried in the soil.

    We can believe that the deeper this root is buried, the better, more luxuriant, and more colorful the flowers will bloom, and the more real scientific fruits will be produced.

    花、果和根
    广东省土壤科学工作者举行讨论会，研究群众性土壤科学活动和专业科学研究的成果；山西省的土洋专家齐聚一堂，共商抗旱大计。来自群众中的“土专家”同专业科学工作者结合；来自生产实践中的经验同理论知识联系起来，就开出了鲜艳的花朵。
    请看：广东土壤科学工作者经过讨论，对充分利用土地资源、改良土壤、不断提高土壤肥力，等等，有许多新的不同体会。山西省土洋专家对抗旱提出了许多好主意。这些不同办法，都有一个特点，就是和生产实际联系得很紧，十分符合当地情况。花，虽然是各色各样的，但是，我们可以相信，这些花结的果，一定是又肥又大，给我们的生产带来丰收。
    花好，果大，都是因为根深。根是什么呢？就是党所指出来的理论联系实际的方针。从去年到今年以来，这个根深深地扎进科学工作者的思想中，就像坚实的根深深地埋进土地中一样。
    我们可以相信，这个根埋得愈深，花一定开得更好，更茂盛，更加五彩缤纷，也一定会结出真正的科学硕果。
