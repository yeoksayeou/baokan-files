Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th—The Ministry of Health convened a National Academic Symposium on Traditional Chinese Medicine Meridians and Acupuncture in Shanghai from July 16th to 29th. This symposium was held under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels and on the basis of the extensive development and certain achievements in the clinical and experimental research of TCM meridian theory and acupuncture in various regions after the Party Central Committee announced last November the "Instructions on the Summary Report of the Party Group of the Ministry of Health on Organizing Western Medicine Practitioners to Leave Their Posts to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine," and after the People's Daily editorial "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine" was published on January 25th of this year. More than 150 Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and scientific research workers from central and provincial/municipal health and medical departments, medical colleges, and relevant scientific research institutions participated in this symposium. Famous TCM doctors Cheng Menxue, Wang Yimen, Yang Jisheng, and Ye Juquan, as well as famous Western medicine doctors and experts Shen Kefei, Zhang Xijun, Xu Fengyan, and Kuang Ankun, attended this symposium. Other scientific research workers enthusiastic about the study of TCM meridian theory were also invited to participate in the meeting.

　　　　Twenty-three Papers Were Read at the Conference
At the meeting, a total of 391 academic papers from 120 units across the country were received. Among them, 35 were related to the theoretical research of meridian theory, 109 to clinical research of acupuncture, 138 to experimental research on the mechanism of acupuncture, 51 to special acupuncture therapies, and 58 to meridian detection and instrument use, as well as other aspects. These academic papers made preliminary summaries and studies on the efficacy or mechanism of acupuncture in treating diseases such as appendicitis, infantile paralysis, deafness, hypertension, neuralgia, rheumatoid arthritis, neurasthenia, and enuresis in recent years. The efficacy of acupuncture in treating bacterial dysentery, malaria, retinitis pigmentosa, optic atrophy, corneal ulcer, menstrual disorders, uterine prolapse, eczema, psoriasis, pulseless disease, and other diseases was also preliminarily explored.

At the beginning of the conference, twenty-three academic papers were read and heated discussions were launched. Among them, the "Report on the Efficacy and Mechanism of Acupuncture Treatment for Appendicitis" by the Shanghai Acupuncture Treatment for Appendicitis Research Collaboration Group indicated that acupuncture has the best effect on simple appendicitis, and the pain disappears quickly after acupuncture, and the body temperature and white blood cells drop quickly. It was also found that intestinal murmurs and peristalsis increased after acupuncture, appendiceal emptying, and the phagocytic index increased. These phenomena preliminarily indicate that acupuncture has the effect of promoting the body's defense function. The "Preliminary Report on the Mechanism of Acupuncture Treatment for a Few Ineffective Cases of Appendicitis" by Xinhua and Renji Hospitals affiliated to the Shanghai Second Medical College preliminarily believed that acupuncture has a poor effect on gangrenous and perforated appendicitis and acute attacks of chronic appendicitis (referring to those caused by fecal stone obstruction, schistosomiasis, ascariasis, and other parasitic diseases), and should be considered as a non-indication. The "Effect of Acupuncture at Different Meridian Points on Cardiac Activity" by the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Acupuncture Research Institute of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the "Application of Yin-Yang Five Elements and Meridian Theory in Clinical Practice" by Cheng Menxue, President of Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the "Application of Meridian Theory and Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment Principles in Acupuncture Treatment of Infantile Paralysis" by Ren Shouzhong, attending physician of Beijing Children's Hospital, and the "Study on the Mechanism of Qigong Treatment for Hypertension" by Professor Kuang Ankun, Director of Internal Medicine Department of Shanghai Guangci Hospital, all aroused the attention of the Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and experts present.

　　　　Discussions Were Harmonious and Frank
This academic conference implemented the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine. Many Chinese and Western medicine experts gathered cordially, discussed academic issues and research work harmoniously and frankly, and expressed their mutual desire to exchange information, exchange materials, cooperate with each other, and support each other in research work in the future, so that research work can achieve newer and greater results. The speeches and discussions at this symposium proved that the principle of using modern scientific methods to sort out and study the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, as pointed out in the People's Daily editorial on January 25th, is correct. Because this principle was implemented, achievements began to be made in the actual sorting and research work, and specific ways were found for the sorting and research work of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine in the future. At the same time, this academic symposium implemented the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the good academic style of seeking truth from facts. Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and experts expressed their opinions freely and had heated discussions on issues such as the theory of TCM meridians, the sorting and research of acupuncture clinics and experiments, various acupuncture techniques, special acupuncture therapies (such as electroacupuncture, hydroacupuncture, etc.), and meridian detectors in the group meetings. Many veteran TCM doctors introduced the TCM meridian theory and their decades of clinical experience in the group meetings, and put forward opinions on future research work. Lu Shouyan and Jiao Mianzhai, famous TCM doctors from Shanghai and Shandong provinces, performed "Burning Mountain Fire" and "Penetrating Heaven Cooling" and other reinforcing and reducing techniques on the spot in the group meetings, which attracted everyone's attention. Through the experience introductions of veteran TCM doctors, many Western medicine practitioners and experts further realized the richness and diversity of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and further strengthened their confidence and determination to study and research traditional Chinese medicine. Many Western medicine practitioners and experts introduced the results of their preliminary research at the meeting, which was also valued by the TCM doctors present. The TCM doctors present were very excited to see that many Western medicine experts across the country were involved in this work, and deeply realized the greatness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. Many Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and experts also provided sincere help and guidance to the research work done by young scientific research workers.

　　　　Increased Mutual Understanding and Strengthened Unity Between Chinese and Western Medicine
After more than ten days of heated discussion, everyone believed that this academic symposium enabled many Chinese and Western medicine experts to further understand the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine through the practice of academic research work, increased mutual understanding and strengthened unity between Chinese and Western medicine. At present, the research work on TCM meridians and acupuncture has had a good start under the leadership of the Party, but it has been a short time to fully carry out this work, and there is still not enough experience. In order to further implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and facilitate the development of original medical schools, it is necessary for Chinese and Western medicine practitioners engaged in this work to do arduous work for a long time in the future. The meeting believed that Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and experts should adopt a variety of ways and methods in the work of sorting out and studying the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Between Chinese and Western medicine and between various schools of thought, there should not be mutual exclusion and distrust, but should continue to strengthen unity and cooperation, learn from each other, respect each other, and learn from each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses. Scientific research work should continue to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," because this is the policy to promote the development and progress of science in our country, and it is the policy to promote the prosperity of our scientific culture. At the same time, in research work, we should also establish a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and a pragmatic and hardworking academic style. The comrades present believed that in order to better sort out and study traditional Chinese medicine, it is necessary to continue to earnestly adopt various forms and methods to strengthen learning in the future. First of all, Western medicine practitioners engaged in the study of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine should earnestly and systematically study the rich clinical experience and theoretical knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, and often learn from veteran TCM doctors. At the same time, TCM doctors with certain conditions should also learn some basic modern medical knowledge such as anatomy, physiology, bacteriology, and pharmacology.

The comrades present believed that this meeting preliminarily summarized the achievements and experience of the research work in the previous period, explored the methods and ways of research work, and will play a certain role in promoting the research work of traditional Chinese medicine.

At the end of the meeting, Shi Ximin, alternate secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made an important speech on the attitude towards the cultural heritage of the motherland, the unity and cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine, and the issue of carrying out academic discussions. Qian Xinzhong, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health, made a concluding speech on the opinions of future research work and other issues. (Attached picture)

　　卫生部召开全国中医经络、针灸学术座谈会
　　中西医促膝相谈交流经验
    新华社上海14日电  卫生部7月16日到29日在上海召开了全国中医经络、针灸学术座谈会。这次座谈会是在党中央去年11月公布了“对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医总结报告的批示”，以及今年1月25日人民日报社论“认真贯彻党的中医政策”发表后，在各级党委的正确领导下，中医经络学说以及针灸的临床和实验研究工作，在各地得到了广泛开展，并且取得了一定成绩的基础上召开的。参加这次座谈会的，有中央和各省市卫生医疗部门、医学院校以及有关科学研究机关的中、西医和科学研究工作者一百五十多人。著名中医程门雪、王易门、杨济生、叶桔泉以及著名西医和专家沈克非、张锡钧、徐丰彦、邝安坤等都参加了这次座谈会。其他热心于中医经络学说的科学研究工作者也应邀参加了这次会议。
          大会宣读了二十三篇论文
    会上，共收到全国一百二十个单位的学术论文三百九十一篇。其中属于经络学说理论研究方面的三十五篇，针灸临床研究方面的一百零九篇、针灸机制实验研究方面的一百三十八篇，针灸特种疗法方面的五十一篇，有关经络探测和仪器使用以及其他方面的五十八篇。这些学术论文，对近年来针灸治疗阑尾炎、小儿麻痹、聋哑、高血压、神经痛、风湿性关节炎、神经衰弱、遗尿症等疾病的疗效或机制进行了初步的整理和研究；对针灸治疗细菌性痢疾、疟疾、视网膜色素变性、视神经萎缩、角膜溃疡、月经病、子宫脱垂、湿疹、牛皮癣、无脉症等疾病的疗效，也进行了初步探讨。
    大会开始时，宣读了二十三篇学术论文，并展开了热烈的讨论。其中，上海市针灸治疗阑尾炎研究协作小组所作的“针灸治疗阑尾炎疗效及作用机制的报告”，说明了针刺对单纯性阑尾炎的疗效最好，针刺后疼痛迅速消失，体温和白血球很快下降；并且发现针刺后肠鸣、肠蠕动增强，阑尾排空以及噬菌指数增高等现象。这些现象初步说明针刺有促进机体的防御机能作用。上海第二医学院附属新华、仁济医院所作的“针灸治疗阑尾炎少数失效病例及其作用机制的初步报告”，初步认为针灸对坏疸性和穿孔性阑尾炎以及慢性阑尾炎急性发作（指有粪石阻塞有血吸虫、蛔虫等寄生虫引起的）的疗效较差，应考虑为非适应症。中国医学科学院实验医学研究所和中医研究院针灸研究所所作的“针刺不同经络的穴位对于心脏活动的影响”，上海中医学院院长程门雪所作的“阴阳五行、经络学说在临床上的运用”，北京市儿童医院主治医师任守中所作的“经络学说与辨症施治原则在针灸治疗小儿麻痹症时的运用”以及上海广慈医院内科主任邝安坤教授所作的“气功治疗高血压机制的研究”等学术报告，都引起了到会的中、西医和专家的注意。
          和畅而又坦率地进行了讨论
    这次学术会，贯彻了党的团结中西医的政策。许多中、西医专家亲切地团聚一堂，和畅而又坦率地讨论学术问题和研究工作，互相表示今后要在研究工作上，互通情报，交换资料，彼此协作，互相支持，使研究工作能够取得更新更大的成效。这次座谈会的发言和讨论，证明了人民日报1月25日社论中所指出的运用现代科学方法整理和研究祖国医学遗产的方针是正确的。因为执行了这一方针，在实际的整理和研究工作上，开始取得了成就，并且为今后对祖国医学遗产的整理研究工作，找出了具体的途径。同时，这次学术座谈会贯彻了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，以及实事求是的良好学风。中、西医和专家在小组会上，对中医经络学说、针灸临床与实验的整理研究、针灸的各种手法、针灸的特种疗法（如电针、水针等）以及经络探测仪等问题，都各抒己见，畅所欲言，进行了热烈的讨论。许多老中医在小组会上介绍了中医经络理论和自己数十年来的临床经验，并对今后的研究工作提出了意见。上海市和山东省的名中医陆瘦燕、焦勉斋在小组会上当场作了“烧山火”、“透天凉”等补泻手法的表演，引起了大家的注意。很多西医和专家通过中医老先生的经验介绍，进一步体会了祖国医学遗产的丰富多采，更增强了自己学习和研究中医的信心和决心。许多西医和专家在会上介绍了他们初步研究的成果，同样得到了到会中医的重视，到会中医看到了全国许多西医专家都投入了这一工作，内心十分激动，深切地体会到党的中医政策的伟大。不少中西医、专家，对青年科学研究工作者所作的研究工作，也都进行了真诚的帮助和指导。
    增进了中西医的相互了解并加强了团结
    经过十多天的热烈讨论，大家认为，这次学术座谈会，使许多中西医专家通过学术研究工作的实践，进一步了解了党的中医政策，增进了中西医之间的互相了解并加强了团结。目前中医经络、针灸学术的研究工作，在党的领导下，有了良好的开端，但全面地开展这一工作，时间还短，经验还很不够。为了进一步贯彻党的中医政策，便于发展有独创性的医药学派，今后还需要从事这一工作的中、西医作长时期的艰巨的工作。会议认为：中、西医和专家在整理研究祖国医学遗产工作中，应当采取多种多样的途径和方法进行，中西医之间和各种学派之间，不是互相排斥，互不信任，而是应该继续加强团结合作，互相学习，互相尊重，取长补短。科学研究工作应当继续贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，因为这是促进我国科学发展和进步的方针，是促进我国科学文化繁荣的方针。同时，在研究工作中，也应当树立高度的革命热情和实事求是、埋头苦干相结合的学风。到会同志认为，为了更好的整理、研究祖国医学，今后还要继续认真地采用各种形式和方法，加强学习；首先是从事研究祖国医学遗产的西医，要认真地系统地学习中医丰富的临床经验和理论知识，经常向中医老先生学习。同时，凡有一定条件的中医也应该学习一些解剖学、生理学、细菌学、药理学等现代医学基础知识。
    到会同志认为：这次会议初步总结了前一个时期研究工作的成绩和经验，探讨了研究工作的方法和途径，对推动中医研究工作，将起一定的作用。
    会议结束时，中共上海市委候补书记石西民到会就对待祖国文化遗产的态度、中西医团结合作和开展学术讨论问题作了重要发言，卫生部副部长钱信忠就今后研究工作意见等问题作了总结发言。（附图片）
