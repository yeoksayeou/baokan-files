　　This year, Hungarian railway transportation achievements are better than any previous year. To welcome the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's Seventh Congress to be held in November this year, this spring, Hungarian railway employees decided to overfulfill the annual transportation task by one million tons and save 130,000 tons of coal. In the first half of this year, they had already overfulfilled the transportation task by 550,000 tons and saved nearly 120,000 tons of coal.
    Last year, Hungary's average load per wagon was 15.2 tons of goods; this year, it has increased to 16.17 tons. So far, 195 transportation units have reached the level of advanced units.
    Due to the bumper harvest in agriculture, railway freight volume will increase by 30% this autumn compared to last year. Railway workers have successively proposed guarantees to victoriously complete this glorious task.
    The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government attaches great importance to the development of railway transportation, and the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) allocates 2 billion forints (Hungarian currency) for this purpose.

　　今年铁路运输成绩空前好
    新华社布达佩斯讯　今年，匈牙利铁路输运成绩比过去任何一年都好。为迎接社会主义工人党将在今年11月举行的第七次代表大会，今年春天，匈牙利的铁路员工决定全年超额完成一百万吨的运输任务和节约十三万吨煤。在今年上半年，他们就已超额完成了五十五万吨的运输任务，节约近十二万吨的煤。
    去年匈牙利平均每车皮装十五点二吨的货物，今年已增加到十六点一七吨。到现在为止，已有一百九十五个运输单位达到了先进单位的水平。
    由于农业丰收，今年秋天铁路运货量将比去年增加30％。铁路工人已纷纷提出保证要胜利完成这一光荣任务。
    工农革命政府非常重视发展铁路运输事业，三年计划（1958—1960年）用于这方面的拨款达二十亿福林（匈币）。
