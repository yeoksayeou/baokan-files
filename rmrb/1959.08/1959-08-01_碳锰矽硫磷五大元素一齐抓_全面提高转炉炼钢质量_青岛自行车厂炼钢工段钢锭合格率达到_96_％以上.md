(Our newspaper, Qingdao, 31st) The Qingdao Bicycle Factory's steelmaking workshop is focusing on the quality of steel. In the steelmaking process, it not only reduced sulfur content but also controlled the content of carbon, manganese, silicon, and phosphorus, as well as defects such as the length, inclusions, porosity, shrinkage cavities, and cracks of the steel ingots. This has resulted in a steel ingot qualification rate of over 96%. These qualified steel ingots are almost entirely made into finished products after rolling.

This workshop's equipment is rudimentary, and the pig iron used for steelmaking has a high sulfur content (generally between 0.3% and 0.7%). However, due to the factory's Party and government leaders, as well as the workshop's cadres and masses, consistently emphasizing steel quality, the problem of high sulfur content in the steel has been basically eradicated since March by resolutely adopting hot-blast alkaline iron-making furnaces. They were not complacent and, to further improve the quality of steel ingots, the factory Party committee proposed to comprehensively improve steel quality and comprehensively address the issues of carbon, manganese, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus. After discussion, the entire workshop, under the slogan of "Every furnace of iron turns into steel, every ladle of steel turns into an ingot, and every ingot becomes a finished product," began a comprehensive assault on the quality barrier starting in March.

To be purposeful, they conducted analysis of steel ingots and rolling and forging tests. They then held exhibitions to show the masses the actual situation of the many internal pores in the steel ingots and the poor rolling and forging results, which attracted everyone's attention and led to the search for the causes. As a result, they discovered that the key to not being able to comprehensively improve the quality of steel ingots was that the three "gates" of carbon reduction, deoxidation, and ingot casting were not well managed. On the one hand, they sent people to other factories to learn advanced experience; on the other hand, they actively took measures to pass through these three gates through production, experimentation, and improvement. In terms of carbon reduction, they accurately controlled the furnace tilting angle and the endpoint carbon. In this way, the carbon content of the steel was stabilized between 0.1% and 0.2%. The rolling and forging effect was better after being cast into ingots. Deoxidation is the key to correctly mastering the manganese and silicon content of molten steel. Their method was to block the slag at the furnace mouth when the steel was tapped, and when nearly one-third of the molten steel had flowed out, they gradually added baked ferromanganese and ferrosilicon along with the molten steel (flexibly mastering the amount added according to the amount of molten steel, carbon content, and oxidation strength) until about two-thirds of the molten steel had flowed out. The advantage of this operation method is that the ferromanganese and ferrosilicon are added evenly, avoiding being absorbed by the slag, and can be fully absorbed by the molten steel, thereby improving the deoxidation efficiency and greatly reducing the pores in the steel ingot. In the ingot casting operation, by improving the steel ladle and the bottom plate of the ingot mold, and flexibly using fine-stream replenishment casting and other methods according to the temperature of the molten steel, the problems of difficulty in forming ingots, short ingots, or inclusions were avoided. In addition, the amount of lime, iron oxide scale, and fluorite added to the furnace was appropriately increased to improve the alkalinity and fluidity of the converter slag, so as to enhance the dephosphorization efficiency.

This workshop strives for excellence in comprehensively addressing steel quality. In addition to paying attention to improving blowing techniques to reduce blowing losses, they also strengthened production scheduling and raw material management, established a batching system, insisted on a furnace-by-furnace steel testing system, strictly implemented operating procedures, and carefully paid attention to equipment maintenance and repair to extend the life of the converter and iron-making furnace.

As a result of the above measures, the qualification rate of steel ingots produced by this workshop, assessed according to the content requirements of the five major elements, reached 62.65% in March and averaged 65.75% in the second quarter. In the first and middle ten days of July, more than 96% of the total production of steel ingots fully met the quality standards of branded steel specified by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. In addition, they have also made many efforts in terms of output. At present, the average utilization coefficient of the converter is generally around seventeen, and the highest is above twenty-six.

    碳锰矽硫磷五大元素一齐抓 
    全面提高转炉炼钢质量
    青岛自行车厂炼钢工段钢锭合格率达到96％以上
    本报青岛31日电　青岛自行车厂炼钢工段大抓钢的质量，在炼钢过程中，不仅做到了降低含硫量，同时还控制了碳、锰、矽、磷的含量，以及钢锭的长度、夹杂、气孔、缩孔、裂纹等缺陷，使钢锭合格率达到96％以上，这些合格钢锭经过轧制，几乎全部成材。
    这个工段设备简陋，用作炼钢的生铁含硫量较高（一般在0.3％到0.7％之间）。但由于工厂的党政领导以及工段的干部和群众，一贯重视钢的质量，早在3月份以前，由于坚决采用了热风碱性化铁炉，基本上根治了钢的高硫症。他们并不自满，为了进一步提高钢锭质量，厂党委提出了要全面提高钢的质量，全面抓碳、锰、矽、硫、磷五大元素的问题。经过讨论，整个工段在“炉炉铁水成钢，包包钢水成锭，根根钢锭成材”的口号下，自3月份开始，就全面围攻质量关。
    为了做到有的放矢，他们进行了解剖钢锭和轧、锻等试验，并把从中发现的钢锭内部气孔多，以及轧、锻效果不良等实况，开展览会告诉群众，引起大家注意，寻找原因。结果，发现钢锭质量不能全面提高的症结所在，主要是拉炭、脱氧、铸锭三“关”没有过好。他们就一方面派人去外厂学习先进经验；另一方面积极采取措施，通过边生产、边试验、边改进，闯过三关。在拉炭方面，他们准确控制摇炉角度和终点炭。这样，钢的含碳量就稳定在0.1％—0.2％之间。铸成锭后，轧、锻效果较好。脱氧是能否正确掌握钢水的锰、矽含量的关键。他们采用的办法是：出钢时在炉口把渣挡住，待钢水流出将近三分之一时，就顺着钢水陆续加入经过烘烤的锰铁和矽铁（根据钢水多少、含碳高低和氧化强弱，灵活掌握加入的数量），直到钢水流出约三分之二时结束。这种操作法的好处在于：锰铁和矽铁加得均匀，避免被渣子汲取，能充分地为钢水所吸收，从而提高脱氧效率，大大减少钢锭中的气孔。在铸锭操作中，由于改进了盛钢桶和浇锭模的底板，并根据钢水温度的高低，灵活运用细流补铸等办法，避免了不易成锭、短锭或夹杂等弊病。此外，还适当增加石灰、氧化铁皮和萤石的入炉量，来提高转炉炉渣碱度和流动性，以增强脱磷效能。
    这个工段在全面抓钢的质量时，力争精益求精。他们除了注意改进吹炼技术，减少吹损外，还加强了生产调度和原料管理工作，建立了配料制度，坚持炉炉钢化验的制度，并严格执行操作规程，认真注意设备的维护检修，延长转炉、化铁炉的寿命。
    由于采取以上的措施，这个工段生产的钢锭，按五大元素的含量要求来考核，在3月份合格率即已达到62.65％，第二季度平均达到65.75％。7月上、中旬，占生产总量96％以上的钢锭，都全面符合冶金工业部规定的牌号钢的质量标准。此外，在产量方面，他们也作了不少努力，目前转炉的平均利用系数一般在十七左右，最高达二十六以上。
