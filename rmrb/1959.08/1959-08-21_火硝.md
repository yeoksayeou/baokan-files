Industrial Knowledge:

    Saltpeter, also known as earth nitrate or potassium nitrate, is made by filtering nitrate-rich soil with water and slowly boiling it. After cooling, it solidifies into saltpeter. It can be used to manufacture black powder and is also a raw material for the chemical industry. It is also needed for making glass, firecrackers, and fireworks. The by-products of salt and brine from boiling saltpeter can be used as fertilizer.
    Nitrate-rich soil is taken from the surface layer of salty and alkaline soil or from old walls. As long as nitrate-rich soil is swept down in winter, spring, or before the wheat harvest, saltpeter can be boiled year-round. In rural areas, materials are often sourced locally and boiled locally. The production process is simple, and the benefits are significant, making it an important sideline production in the vast rural areas of our country. After the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production last year, the amount of saltpeter used has increased. In some places, farmers also use methods such as cultivating saltpeter seeds or growing nitrate-rich soil to produce saltpeter. Saltpeter seed cultivation involves pouring human urine on the ground, which, after being exposed to the sun and oxidized for about two weeks, forms nitrate-rich soil. Growing nitrate-rich soil involves adding human urine to already boiled nitrate-rich soil, and after a certain period, it can be swept for saltpeter. In many areas of the South and Southwest, natural nitrate-rich soil has also been found in caves, which farmers call cave saltpeter.
    The main producing areas of saltpeter are Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi provinces, and other regions also produce some. Last year, the national output of saltpeter reached about 1.5 million dan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    火硝
    火硝又名土硝或钾硝。将硝土用水过滤，慢火熬制，待凉后凝结即为火硝。它可以制造黑色炸药，又是化学工业的原料，制造玻璃、鞭炮、焰火等也都需要火硝。熬硝时的副产品盐和卤水，可以作肥料。
    硝土取自含盐、碱性的土壤表层或老墙土上。只要冬、春季或麦黄前把硝土扫下，就可以常年熬硝。农村中多是就地取材，就地熬制，生产过程简单，收益较大，是我国广大农村中一项重要的副业生产。去年全国工农业生产大跃进后，火硝的用量增多，有的地方农民们还用种硝或培植硝土的办法，生产火硝。种硝是把人尿泼在地皮上，经日晒、氧化约两周后，即结成硝土。培植硝土是将已熬制过的硝土，加上人尿，经过一定时间，就可以扫硝。南方和西南的许多地区还在山洞中发现了天然的硝土，农民们称它做洞硝。
    火硝的主要产地是河南、山东、河北、贵州、四川、浙江、陕西等省，其他各地也生产一部分。去年全国的火硝产量已经达到一百五十万公担左右。　（新华社）
