If you go to the fields of the Laoguanzhai People's Commune in Linqing City, Shandong, you can immediately feel the enthusiasm of the commune members to strive for a great autumn harvest. Red flags are waving, and green waves are rising and falling. From the Party committee secretary of the commune to the cadres of each team, they all work with the commune members. A competition is underway between teams to win the autumn bumper harvest red flag. Large areas of cotton, soybeans, corn, sweet potatoes, and radishes are growing better than in previous years. In particular, the 30,000-mu continuous soybean high-yield plot, due to timely and meticulous planting, application of base fertilizer, and complete emergence of seedlings, is growing vigorously. Commune members happily say: The more we work, the more energetic we become. We just had a great wheat harvest, and now another great autumn harvest is in sight. To welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day and report good news to Chairman Mao, the whole commune is carrying out a "six-no" movement (no weedy wasteland, no unfertilized land, no pests, no third-class seedlings, no drought or flood disasters, no hardened land) in field management, centered on accumulating and applying fertilizer. In the cotton fields, to avoid cotton boll shedding, a "one catty of fertilizer for one cotton plant" movement is underway to protect buds and bolls. Zhou Yugui, the women's squad leader of Qianfeng Village, led 20 women to deliver 140,000 catties of manure to the fields in one day; she alone delivered 34 carts, totaling 10,200 catties. They are determined to make the yields of grain and cotton exceed the contracted targets by 50 percent.

Why are they so motivated? This is closely related to the fact that the first harvest after communization was a bumper one. The success of the wheat harvest greatly boosted their confidence in increasing production; the experience of intensive wheat cultivation also inspired them to manage the autumn seedlings more carefully, changing the rough cultivation habits of the past. The wheat harvest has greatly changed the local production and living conditions.

"Transforming Low-lying Alkaline Land into Fertile Fields, One Season is Better Than One Year"

Laoguanzhai Commune is located on the west bank of the Wei River in Linqing City. In the past, this was a vast expanse of low-lying alkaline wasteland. When it rained a lot, the low-lying areas became undulating lakes. When it was dry, it became barren land covered in white alkali. This area totals 127,000 mu of land. Among them, more than 60,000 mu are low-lying areas, which people call "Toad Pits." Among them, 38,000 mu are old alkaline depressions, which people call "Grazing Fields." In fact, this place does not even grow grass. Even if horses go there, there is no grass to eat. Instead, locusts occur every year, harming the crops. If the water comes early, the autumn seedlings are flooded; if the water comes late, planting cannot be done until April of the following year. If it is dry, either planting is impossible, or the seedlings do not emerge after planting, or they wither and are eaten by locusts after emerging. Therefore, the 68 villages and more than 42,000 farmers here have always lived in poverty for many years. The villagers describe the living conditions of the people in this area as: "Toad pits, barren alkaline slopes, spring drought, autumn floods, and many locusts, floods twice every three years, running around to make a living."

"Thin soup in the morning, chaff nest at noon, and two bowls of糊涂 (hútú, a kind of porridge) to drink in the evening." Yang Lan, a 74-year-old farmer from Heizhuang Production Team, recalled: "Our place is a disaster for every family and poverty for every generation. In 1943, 82 out of 94 households in the whole village went bankrupt and survived the famine, and 61 households fled. So far, 127 people have not returned and died." After liberation, under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and through the path of collectivization, production here has undergone considerable development and changes. However, because of the poor natural conditions and the weak economic strength of the masses, it was still impossible to get rid of the threat of natural disasters. In 1958, they suffered from floods, and the state allocated a large amount of relief grain and funds to them. In the autumn of 1958, people's communes were established here. The collective strength of the people's communes is greater than the collective strength of the agricultural cooperatives. The Party organization and the people of Laoguanzhai Commune made a grand wish and set a great ambition to fully utilize the huge strength of the large collective, change the natural outlook, and win a great harvest on the low-lying alkaline wasteland.

After the establishment of the commune, the commune Party committee mobilized the masses to hold a great debate on the topic of "Eliminating the Three Pests (water, insects, and weeds) to Ensure a Bumper Harvest," eliminating various right-leaning conservative ideas and feelings of fear of difficulties in the struggle against nature, and increasing the determination and perseverance that man can conquer nature. Everyone believed that to conquer drought and flood disasters, it is necessary to actively carry out the river network water conservancy construction. They decided to build and excavate the Qingliang River drainage canal to find a way out for water storage after floods. To avoid upstream and downstream conflicts, the commune unified planning, built reservoirs and dug pits and ponds according to the terrain, dispersed the water force, and reduced the flooded area. In addition, it is necessary to dig wells to find springs and draw underground water. In this way, it will be possible to change the past situation where only autumn crops could be planted, not wheat, and "a good year only yields half a harvest, and a bad year loses everything."

They also learned from the methods of transforming alkaline land in other places, summarized the experience of transforming alkaline land in their commune, and decided to deeply plow the land, apply more manure, suppress sand to improve alkali, and divert water to wash alkali, changing the low-lying alkaline and barren land into fertile fields.

The Great Collective Exerts Great Power

After the great debate, "Planting enough wheat and planting it well, vowing to win a great wheat harvest" became the unanimous determination and action of all cadres and commune members.

Under the unified leadership of the commune, a "field army" of 10,000 people to conquer nature was immediately organized. The secretary of the Linqing Municipal Party Committee and the director of rural work, the secretary of the commune Party committee and the director of the commune, all went to the front line to participate in the battle and strengthen specific leadership. They camped together with the masses, sharing food and lodging. After 36 days of hard work, 70,000 mu of land were deeply plowed more than eight inches deep; then, wheat was planted in a timely manner on 61,800 mu of deeply plowed land. Among them, more than 2,000 mu of experimental fields were deeply plowed two feet deep, with a base fertilizer of 8,000 to 10,000 catties per mu; 36,240 mu of large-area high-yield fields were deeply plowed one foot deep, with a base fertilizer of 3,000 to 5,000 catties per mu; and 23,360 mu of general fields were deeply plowed eight inches deep, with a base fertilizer of 2,500 to 7,000 catties per mu. With the unified leadership of the commune, the wheat varieties were quickly standardized, and all 60,000 mu of wheat adopted suitable local varieties. The sparse planting two-legged seed drill was also uniformly changed by the commune into a dense planting five-legged seed drill; the amount of seeds sown per mu increased to 25 to 30 catties.

After the wheat emerged, all 60,000 mu of large tracts of land were covered with green new clothes, changing the monotonous appearance of the past with white alkali and black soil. The commune members were all overjoyed to see such large tracts of wheat fields that they had never seen before. The dense and vigorous wheat foreshadowed a great harvest in the future, which further boosted people's enthusiasm. While praising "Deep plowing and more fertilizer, reasonable close planting and good varieties, planting enough, planting early and managing well, the people's commune has great strength," they launched a new battle.

They successively organized 13,600 full and semi-laborers, and after a winter and spring of hard work, built 11 reservoirs, 36 canals, 16 water diversion dikes, and 4 large and small branch canals, totaling 180 li; there were even more bucket canals, farm canals, and hair canals. 2,200 new wells were dug and old wells were repaired, 96 mechanized wells, equipped with eight water pumps (totaling 290 horsepower), and a 150-horsepower pumping irrigation station was built, which could irrigate 50,000 mu of land by gravity flow. All 60,000 mu of wheat fields were built into large and small paddy fields. As a result, the reservoirs and canals were basically connected, the ditches were connected, the canals and wells were used in combination, and the storage and use were combined; water conservancy and paddy fields were realized. The irrigation area of the whole commune's 120,000 mu of land reached more than 90%. The entire water conservancy project can basically ensure that heavy rain does not cause disasters and that there is a guaranteed harvest without rain. This year's wheat was able to be watered in a timely manner under such conditions, meeting the requirements of soil compaction, freezing, greening, jointing, and ear development. This year's wheat returned to green early, with thick stalks and large ears, which is inseparable from the large-scale water conservancy construction by the collective strength after communization.

In order to promote wheat production, the commune members had a particularly great enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer. After communization, it was easier to divide labor and develop diverse economies. Since the beginning of spring, more than 200 large livestock and more than 700 pigs have been added, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has increased by 68% compared with last year. Under the unified leadership of the commune, each team also carried out a "five times three mu one pit fertilizer" fertilizer production movement, accumulating 1.13 billion catties of miscellaneous fertilizer and producing 3.8 million catties of local chemical fertilizer. The 61,000 mu of wheat were top-dressed three to four times. In particular, for the third-class seedlings, in order to force them to upgrade, top-dressing was done more than five or six times.

In order to strengthen field management and ensure a wheat harvest, the entire commune also organized 105 wheat management professional teams, totaling 4,426 people, to contract out the work from planting to harvesting, and to carry out a series of field management work in a timely and reasonable manner. The wheat grew particularly vigorously due to diligent management and good management. There were no diseases or insect pests in all the wheat fields, and there was no lodging.

After communization, the Party committee also made it easier to strengthen leadership over production in the commune. The Municipal Party Committee's leadership over the commune's production was timely and specific. Comrade Zhang Jinghu, the first secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, planted experimental fields in the commune, which strongly guided the wheat field management work at various stages. Comrade Xi Guangshi, the director of the Rural Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, lived in the commune for a long time, helping and guiding specifically, and participating in production together with grassroots cadres and commune members, leading production. Comrade Zhang Zengyu, secretary of the commune Party committee, Comrade Yan Zhending, director of the commune, and others all set an example, leading the production team leaders, branch secretaries, and the masses of the whole commune to manage the wheat fields day and night. Cadres at all levels also planted 2,200 mu of experimental fields, which played a great role in guiding and promoting large-scale high-yield production.

After communization, it was also easier to exchange production experience. The commune successively held more than ten on-site meetings in the Beisanli and Jiandian areas, introduced successful experiences, improved the ideological awareness and production management level of the vast number of commune members, boosted the enthusiasm of all commune members, and made the production of various production units more balanced.

From Victory to
Greater Victory

The eight-month battle to win a wheat harvest was finally victorious. The wheat was ripe, and the past "Toad Pits" became a boundless sea of wheat. The wind blowing the阵阵 (zhènzhèn, waves of) wheat fragrance made everyone who walked into the fields smile. At this time, the cadres and masses of Laoguanzhai Commune suddenly had a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow. They were happy that the yellow, plump wheat was about to return home and into the barn, and the poor days of the entire commune would be over. What they were worried about was that so much wheat would be damaged by rain and could not be harvested in time. Such a large high-yield plot, the wheat grew tall, the ridges were thick, and the straw was thick, and a sickle could not cut through it. The results of the test cutting showed that each person could only cut three or four fen of land a day; even if all the labor was transferred to harvest and send it to the field, it would take more than 20 days. If it encounters continuous rain, the wheat that is about to be obtained will be lost. What to do? The commune Party committee mobilized the masses to discuss this matter. The masses unanimously believed that the grain that has been worked hard for a year should not be lost. We must give play to the superiority of the commune, pool our wisdom and efforts, overcome difficulties, harvest carefully and meticulously, and return every grain to the home. A movement to seize grain from the Dragon King's mouth unfolded. In addition to mobilizing the entire people and going all out, the commune also transferred 9,000 people, implemented "large-scale operations," divided battle lines, and contracted out the work to carry out a wheat harvest battle. The seven management areas and one hundred production teams also carried out a red flag competition in harvesting. More than 6,000 people were mobilized from various municipal organs, troops, and schools, and some transportation machinery, vehicles, and livestock were also drawn to vigorously support. The "Toad Pits" and "Alkaline Slopes," which used to be desolate and rarely traveled by people, became places with busy traffic and loud noises. The sound of machine motors, the sound of cars and horses, the songs of harvest, and the laughter of the crowd, the sound of sickles cutting wheat, never stopped day and night. Cars, tractors, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, manpower carts, shoulder poles, it was really an infinite force! The scattered wheat kernels in the fields were quickly piled up into high wheat stacks around the village. ...

The results of the seven-level inspection and acceptance by representatives of the province, special zone, city, commune, brigade, production team, and the masses showed that the average yield per mu of the 11,000 mu high-yield plot was 506 catties; of which 4,400 mu had a yield of 516 catties per mu; and the average yield per mu of the 20 mu of high-yield experimental field of Bailu wheat planted by cadres was 1,025 catties. The actual harvest of 61,800 mu of wheat exceeded the estimated figures. This was a bumper harvest that Laoguanzhai Commune had never had before! The low-yield area has become a high-yield area, and the average yield of wheat in the entire commune is 251 catties per mu, which is 2.67 times higher than last year. Because the area of wheat planting was expanded, the total output increased by 4.17 times. This year's total wheat output was 15,510,000 catties, exceeding the total output of 9,600,000 catties in the summer and autumn of 1958 by 61%, realizing the grand ambition of "Working hard and really hard and adding more effort to ensure that one season is better than one year" that was proposed when strengthening wheat management. How could the masses of Laoguanzhai, who have been drinking sorghum porridge and rarely eating white flour, not smile and celebrate this year's great wheat harvest!

Laoguanzhai Commune has a total of 42,126 people. After the great wheat harvest, the entire commune, in addition to leaving an average of 105 catties of grain per person, a part of public accumulation, 1.26 million catties of seeds (70,000 mu of wheat will be planted next year, with more than 20 catties of seeds reserved per mu), 20% of the surplus grain for each team will be given as a surplus reward, and 200,000 catties of reserve grain will be reserved, will sell 3,670,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, after paying the full annual public grain of 840,000 catties in one season. A total of 477,000 yuan can be received from the sale of surplus grain. The 14,000 full and semi-laborers in the entire commune can receive an average income of more than 34 yuan per laborer. Therefore, everyone in the entire commune was delighted. The masses generally reflected that the great harvest this year is the victory of the superiority of the people's commune! It is the great victory of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading everyone to the people's commune! We must always follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! Zong Jindou, an 83-year-old poor peasant from Jiandian Production Team, happily sang such a快板 (kuàibǎn, a form of rhythmic storytelling) after the wheat harvest this year: "I, the old man, am eighty-three, and when I think of the past days, they are like a mountain of knives. Since the Communist Party came, life has become stronger every year. Last year, the people's commune was realized, it's like ascending to heaven in one step. I have never seen this year's bumper wheat, and I didn't expect to turn over my body in happiness when I was old. This is the good leadership of the Party, this is the good policy of Chairman Mao, this is the glory of the people's commune!"

The people's commune brought a great wheat harvest, and the great wheat harvest further boosted the enthusiasm of every commune member. Shi Zhende from Jiandian, a family of four, divided more than 700 catties of wheat and 250 yuan in cash for grain and surplus grain. He said excitedly: "The wheat harvest in summer made my enthusiasm soar; in order to make another leap forward in the autumn harvest, I will double my enthusiasm!" This is the unanimous determination of all commune members. According to the mood of the masses, the commune Party committee immediately put forward the slogan "Riding the wheat waves forward, winning the red flag of the autumn harvest." This slogan of the Party immediately turned into practical action.

Under the glorious banner of the people's commune, several armies striving for a great autumn harvest are fighting bravely. They must achieve greater victories!

　　人民公社放光彩
　　中共聊城地委第一书记　李吉平
    你只要走到山东临清市老官寨人民公社的田里，一眼看去，就可以感觉到社员们争取秋季大丰收的干劲。红旗招展，绿波起伏。从公社党委书记到各队干部，都同社员一起劳动。队与队之间正在展开争夺秋季丰产红旗的竞赛。大片大片的棉花、大豆、玉米、甘薯、萝卜，长得都比往年出色。特别是三万亩连片的大豆丰产方，由于种的适时、细致，施了底肥，小苗出的齐全，生长旺盛。社员们高兴地说：生产越干越有劲，刚刚得到了麦子大丰收，秋季大丰收又摆在眼前了。为了迎接国庆十周年，向毛主席报捷，全社正开展着一个以积肥追肥为中心的田间管理的“六无”运动（无草荒地、无不追肥地、无虫害、无三类苗、无旱涝灾害、无板结地）。在棉田里，为了避免棉铃脱落，正在开展着“一棵棉花一斤肥”的保蕾保铃追肥运动。前冯村妇女小队长周玉桂带领二十个妇女向地内一天送粪十四万斤；她一人一天送三十四车，总共一万零二百斤。他们决心要使粮、棉产量都超过包产指标五成。
    他们的干劲为什么这样大？这同公社化以后的第一次收获就是个特大丰收有密切关系。小麦丰收的成绩，大大鼓舞了他们增产的信心；小麦精耕细作的经验，也启示他们把秋苗管理得更细致，改变了过去耕作粗糙的习惯。小麦的丰收，把当地的生产面貌、生活面貌大大改变了。
  “洼碱变良田，一季顶一年”
   老官寨公社在临清市的卫河西岸。这里过去是一片一望无际的洼碱荒地。雨多了，洼地就变成波涛起伏的湖泊。天旱了，又成为白碱赤地。这块地方共有十二万七千亩地。其中六万多亩洼地，人们称之为“蛤蟆坑”。其中三万八千亩老碱窝，人们叫做“放马场”，实际上这地方连草也不长，马去了也没草可吃，倒是年年发生蝗虫，危害田苗。水来得早，秋苗就被淹；水来得晚，来年4月才能播种。旱了，不是种不上，就是种上以后不见苗，或者见苗以后枯死、被蝗虫吃光。因此，这里的六十八个村庄，四万二千多农民群众，从来就过着长年贫困的生活。老乡们描述这个地方人民生活的状况是：“蛤蟆坑，荒碱坡，春旱秋涝蝗虫多，三年两次发洪水，奔走四方谋生活。”
  “早清汤，午糠窝，晚上两碗糊涂喝。”黑庄生产大队七十四岁的农民杨兰回忆说：“我们这里是家家灾，辈辈穷。1943年全村九十四户，就有八十二户破产度荒，六十一户外逃，至今在外未归和死亡的就有一百二十七人。”解放后，人们在共产党和人民政府的领导、支持下，经过合作化的道路，这里的生产虽然有了不少的发展变化，但是因为自然条件差，群众经济力量单薄，所以还不可能摆脱自然灾害的威胁。1958年受了水灾，国家还给他们拨了大量的救济粮款。1958年秋天，这里建立了人民公社。人民公社的大集体的力量比农业社的小集体的力量更大了。老官寨公社的党组织和人民群众，立宏愿，树大志，决心充分运用大集体的巨大的力量，改变自然面貌，在洼碱荒地上夺取大丰收。
    公社成立之后，公社党委就发动群众，以
  “除三害（水、虫、草）保丰收”为题目，大鸣大放大辩论，消除了对自然斗争中的各种各样的右倾保守思想和畏难情绪，增加了人定胜天的决心和毅力。大家认为，要征服水旱灾害，必须积极开展河网化的水利建设。他们决定修挖清凉江排水渠，为涝灾后的蓄水找出路。为了避免上下游矛盾，由公社统一规划，按照地势修水库，挖坑塘，分散水势，缩小淹地面积。此外，还要打井找泉，引用地下水。这样，就可以改变过去只能种秋、不能种麦，“好年半季收，歉年全部丢”的状况。
    他们还学习了外地改造碱地的办法，总结了本社改造碱地的经验，决定深翻土地，多施圈肥，压砂改碱，引水洗碱，改变洼碱瘠薄土地为肥沃的良田。
        大集体发挥大威力
    大辩论以后，“把小麦种足种好，誓夺小麦大丰收”成了全社干部和社员群众一致的决心和行动。
    在公社统一领导下，立即组织了一万名征服自然的“野战大军”。临清市委书记和农村工作部长，公社党委书记和社长，都到第一线去参加战斗，加强具体领导。他们同群众一起安营扎寨，食宿共处。经过三十六天的苦战，把七万亩土地深翻八寸以上；接着，在六万一千八百亩深翻的土地上及时地种上了小麦。其中有二千多亩试验田深翻二尺，每亩铺底肥八千至一万斤；有三万六千二百四十亩大面积丰产田深翻一尺，每亩铺底肥三千至五千斤；一般田二万三千三百六十亩，深翻八寸，每亩铺底肥二千五百至七千斤。有了公社的统一领导，很快就实现了小麦良种化，六万多亩小麦全部采用了适合当地的良种。稀植的两腿耧，也由公社统一改成了密植的五腿耧；每亩播种量增加到二十五斤至三十斤。
    麦子出土后，在这六万多亩的大片土地上，全都披上了绿油油的新装，改变了过去白碱黑土的那种枯燥的面貌。社员们看到这种从来没有见过的大片麦田，人人都喜气洋洋。密茂茁壮的小麦，预兆着未来的大丰收，更加鼓舞着人们的干劲。他们一面赞美着“土地深翻施肥多，合理密植良种化，种足种早管理好，人民公社力量大”，一面展开了新的战斗。
    他们先后共组织了一万三千六百名整半劳力，经过一冬一春大干苦干，修建了水库十一个，水渠三十六条，迎水堤十六道，大小支渠四道，共一百八十里；斗渠、农渠、毛渠就更多了。打新井修旧井二千二百眼，机井九十六眼，装了八部抽水机（共二百九十马力），并建成了一个一百五十马力的扬水灌溉站，可自流灌溉五万亩地。六万亩麦田，全部修成了大小畦田。这一来，就基本上实现了库渠相通，沟沟相连，渠井并用，蓄用兼施；实现了水利化、畦田化。全社十二万亩土地，灌溉面积达90％以上。整个水利工程基本上可以做到大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收。今年的小麦就是在这样的条件下实现了适时浇水，满足了盘墩、封冻，返青、拔节、育穗的要求。今年小麦返青早、秸秆粗、抽穗大，同公社化以后用大集体的力量大兴水利是分不开的。
    为了促进小麦丰产，社员们的积肥劲头特别大。公社化以后便于分工发展多种经济了，入春以来增添大牲畜二百多头，猪七百多头，积肥数量比去年增加68％。在公社统一领导下，各队还开展了“五次三亩一坑肥”的造肥运动，积杂肥十一亿三千万斤，制造土化肥三百八十万斤。六万一千亩小麦追肥三次到四次。特别是三类苗，为了迫使他们升级，追肥都在五、六次以上。
    为了加强田间管理、保证小麦丰收，全公社还组织了一百零五个小麦管理专业队，共四千四百二十六人，从种到收分片包干，适时合理地进行了一系列的田间管理工作。小麦由于管理勤、管理得好，生长格外茂盛，全部麦田没有发生病虫害，也没有发生倒伏现象。
    公社化以后，党委对社里的生产也便于加强领导了。市委对公社的生产领导得及时而又具体。市委第一书记张镜湖同志在公社里种的试验田，有力地指导了各个时期的麦田管理工作。市委农村工作部长席广师同志长期住在公社，具体帮助指导，并同基层干部和社员一起参加生产，领导生产。公社党委书记张增玉同志、社长阎振顶同志等，都以身作则，带领全社生产队长、支部书记和群众一起昼夜管理麦田。各级干部还种了试验田二千二百亩，对指导和推动大面积丰产起了很大作用。
    公社化以后，更便于交流生产经验了。公社先后在北三里、简店两个地区召开十余次现场会议，介绍成功经验，提高了广大社员群众的思想觉悟和生产管理水平，鼓舞了全体社员的干劲，使各个生产单位的生产都比较平衡。
    从胜利走向
      更大的胜利
    八个月的争取小麦丰收的战斗，终于胜利了。麦子熟了，过去的“蛤蟆坑”变成了一望无边的麦海。风吹阵阵麦香，使走到田间的人们无不喜笑颜开。这时，老官寨公社的干部和群众，突然发生了喜愁交集的情绪。他们喜的是：黄澄澄的籽饱粒满的小麦就要归家入仓了，全公社群众的贫苦的日子就要过去了。愁的是：这么多的麦子怕下雨不能及时收割起来，遭到损失。这么大的丰产方，麦子长的高，垅厚秸粗，一镰拉不透。试割的结果，每人一天只能割三、四分地；就是抽调全部劳力，收割下来送到场内，也得二十多天。要是碰上了连阴雨，眼看到手的麦子就要丢掉了。怎么办？公社党委发动群众讨论了这件事。群众一致认为，一年辛苦到口边的粮食不能让他丢掉，必须发挥公社的优越性，群策群力，克服困难，精收细打，颗粒还家。一个向龙王口里夺粮的运动展开了。公社除了全民动员、全力以赴外，还抽调了九千人，实行“大兵团作战”，划分战线，分片包干，开展了麦收大战。七个管理区，一百个生产队在收割中还开展了红旗竞赛。市内各机关、部队、学校动员了六千多人，还抽出一部分运输机械、车辆、牲畜，大力支援。往日凄凉少人行走的“蛤蟆坑”、“盐碱坡”，变成了车水马龙、喧声震天的地方。机器马达声，车马声，丰收歌声和人群的喜笑声，刹刹的镰刀割麦声，昼夜不绝。汽车、拖拉机、马车、牛车、人力车、担挑，真是无穷的力量！地里的零散的麦个子，很快在村周围堆成高大的麦垛。……
    省、专区、市、公社、大队、生产队、群众代表七级验打验收的结果：一万一千亩的丰产方平均亩产五百零六斤；内有四千四百亩亩产五百一十六斤；其中干部的高额丰产试验田白露麦二十亩，亩产平均为一千零二十五斤。  六万一千八百亩小麦实收结果，突破了估产数字。这是老官寨公社从来没有过的大丰收！低产区变成了高产区，全社小麦平均亩产二百五十一斤，比去年提高了二点六七倍。因为扩大了种麦面积，总产量提高了四点一七倍。今年小麦总产一千五百五十一万斤，超过1958年夏秋两季总产量九百六十万斤的61％，实现了在加强小麦管理时提出的“苦干实干加油干，保证一季顶一年”的宏愿。年年光喝高粱稀粥，很少吃到白面的老官寨群众，怎能不喜笑颜开，庆贺今年的小麦大丰收呢！
    老官寨公社共有四万二千一百二十六个人。小麦大丰收后，全社除了留下平均每人一百零五斤的口粮、一部分公共积累、一百二十六万斤种子（明年种麦七万亩，每亩留种二十多斤）、各队超产部分发给20％的超产奖励、再留出二十万斤储备粮、将全年的公粮八十四万斤一季交足外，还卖给了国家余粮三百六十七万斤。共可收到四十七万七千元的余粮售款。全社一万四千个整半劳力，每个劳力平均可得到三十四元多的收入。因此，全社人人欢欣鼓舞。群众普遍反映：今年得到这样的大丰收，是人民公社的优越性的胜利！是共产党毛主席领导大家走向人民公社化的伟大胜利！我们要永远遵照毛主席和共产党指出的方向前进！简店生产队的八十三岁的贫农宗金斗在今年小麦丰收后，高兴地唱出这样一首快板：“我老汉八十三，想起过去的日子似刀山。自从来了共产党，生活一年强一年，去年实现了公社化，真像一步上了天。没见过今年的丰收麦，没想到老来幸福把身翻。这是党的好领导，这是毛主席的好政策，这是人民公社放光彩！”
    人民公社带来了小麦大丰收，小麦大丰收更加鼓舞着每个社员的干劲。简店石振德，四口人，口粮加超产粮就分了七百多斤麦子，二百五十元现款。他兴奋地说：“夏季小麦丰收，我的干劲冲天；为了秋收再跃进，干劲还要再加翻！”这是全体社员一致的决心。公社党委根据群众的情绪，立即提出了“乘麦浪前进，夺秋收红旗”的口号。党的这个口号立即变成了实际行动。
    在人民公社的光辉旗帜下，争取秋季大丰收的几路大军正在奋勇战斗。他们一定要取得更大的胜利！
