    Wuhan Aviation Station
    Uses Aircraft to Help Commune Eliminate Cotton Pests
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Wuhan Aviation Station is using aircraft to assist the Xushi People's Commune in Jiangling County in eliminating cotton pests, and has achieved significant results.
    The Xushi People's Commune has 90,000 mu of cotton fields, of which 70,000 mu are entering the peak budding period. At this time, various pests are occurring in large numbers. According to the inspection by the Qunyi Management Area's Worker-Peasant Production Team, 20% of the plants are affected by the cotton fleahopper, 20% of the green bolls are affected by the pink bollworm, and 18% of the plants are affected by the cutworm, seriously affecting cotton growth. According to the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Jingzhou Prefectural Party Committee, the Commune Party Committee signed a two-and-a-half-month pest control contract with the Wuhan Aviation Station. Before the aircraft pest control, the commune trained more than 40 pest observers and signalers. On the morning of the 9th, the aircraft began to control pests over a vast cotton field of about 7.5 kilometers in length and width in the Qunyi and Heyi Management Areas. In less than three hours, pest control reached more than 20,000 mu. Members of the Zengchan No. 1 Team in the Heyi Management Area inspected their 60 mu of cotton fields twice and were very happy to see that every cotton plant leaf was covered with medicine, finely and evenly. According to the commune cadres' estimates, the commune can save 200,000 labor days and reduce a large amount of pesticide waste within two and a half months.
    While the aircraft was controlling pests, each production team also actively organized labor to carry out manual prevention and control. They inspected each plot and patch, and once they found cotton plants with pests, they immediately took various measures to eliminate the pests in the early stages of occurrence. (Hong Liu)

    武汉航空站
    用飞机帮助公社除治棉虫
    本报讯　武汉航空站用飞机协助江陵县许市人民公社除治棉虫，收到显著效果。
    许市人民公社有九万亩棉田，其中七万亩进入现蕾盛期。这时各种害虫大量发生。据群益管理区工农生产队检查，盲春象为害株达20％，红铃虫为害青铃达20％，金钢钻为害株达18％，严重地影响棉花生长。公社党委根据湖北省委和荆州地委的指示同武汉航空站签定了为期两个半月的治虫合同。飞机治虫前，公社训练了虫情测报员、讯号员四十多人。9日清晨，飞机开始在群益、合义两个管理区纵横约七点五公里的广阔棉田上治虫。不到三小时，治虫达二万亩以上。合义管理区增产一队社员在六十亩棉田里检查了两次，看到棉株叶叶有药，又细又匀，都十分高兴。据公社干部估计，在两个半月内公社可节省二十万个劳力和减少大量农药的浪费。
    在飞机治虫的同时，各生产队还积极组织劳力，进行了人工防治。逐片逐块检查，发现有虫棉株，即采取各种办法突击，把虫害消灭在初发生阶段。（洪流）
