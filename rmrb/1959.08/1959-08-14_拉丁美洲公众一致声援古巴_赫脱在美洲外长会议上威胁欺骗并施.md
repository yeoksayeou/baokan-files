Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 12th: The public in Latin American countries opposes the United States' plot to interfere in Cuba through the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers held in Chile.

According to a report by Latin American News Agency on August 12th, the Uruguayan House of Representatives announced: "The Uruguayan Parliament expresses its fraternal support to the people and current government of Cuba and Venezuela to the Meeting of Foreign Ministers, hoping to take measures to oppose and isolate dictatorial regimes, because the existence of these dictatorial regimes is a disgrace to the American continent."

In El Salvador, organizations such as the Workers' Union and the El Salvador Association for Latin American Solidarity passed resolutions demanding that the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers take measures to expel the representatives of dictatorial regimes in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay from the Organization of American States.

In Brazil, Labor Party Congressman Magalhaes issued a statement on the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, pointing out that all meetings that expect Latin American countries to receive more assistance from the United States have never achieved the desired results. Only when Latin American countries hold meetings to raise their problems and solve them with their own funds can satisfactory achievements be obtained.

In the capital and major cities of Costa Rica, slogans such as "Get out of Cuba" and "Long live the Cuban Revolution" were posted. On the evening of the 11th, a rally in support of the Cuban Revolution was held in the Sagrada Familia district with the participation of prominent domestic figures, and a telegram of moral support for the Cuban Revolution was passed. In addition, a committee to support Cuba was established.

In Ecuador, the leader of the Socialist Party of Guayas Province, Ayal Nuñez, expressed his support for the Cuban people and strongly condemned Pan-Americanism. Ayal Nuñez said that Latin America should demand the restoration of Puerto Rico's independence and demand that the United States end its colonial rule over the Virgin Islands. He went on to say that the Ecuadorian people stand with their Cuban brothers in defending Latin America's national sovereignty.

The "Peruvian Committee for the Liberation of the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Paraguay" also condemned the U.S.-manipulated Foreign Ministers' meeting for possible collective intervention in Cuba and demanded that Latin American countries sever relations with dictatorial regimes.

A dispatch from Caracas on the 11th said that Nicaraguan revolutionary leader Dr. Guillermo Urbina Vasquez told reporters, condemning attempts to repeat the Guatemalan incident in Cuba through the Foreign Ministers' meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: Santiago Dispatch: The Meeting of American Foreign Ministers held its first plenary session on the 12th at the Carrera Hotel in the Chilean capital.

Chilean President Alessandri delivered the opening speech. He spoke of Chile's defense of the principle of non-interference, but that did not mean condoning dictatorial regimes. Alessandri also said that the meeting must be careful not to infringe upon the sovereignty of the countries concerned when discussing the situation in the Caribbean region.

Alessandri also welcomed the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter then delivered a speech at the meeting, talking at length about the "good role" of the "Pan-American system" created single-handedly by the United States, and said that the "Pan-American system is facing a critical moment in history." He also boasted about the "good neighborliness" and "economic cooperation" of the Americas, although everyone knows that, apart from U.S. intervention and plunder of Latin American countries, there is no beautiful "good neighborliness" and "cooperation" between the United States and Latin American countries.

Herter threatened that convening the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers "in itself proves that there is a crisis" in the (Pan-American system), so "collective efforts" must be made to "deal with the crisis." He warned that the United States "will not allow itself to be deceived and ignore the chaotic signs (in the Caribbean region)." Herter also deliberately emphasized the so-called "collective security principle" of the "Organization of American States." As everyone knows, many of the United States' misdeeds of interfering in Latin American countries have always been carried out under the banner of "collective security."

It is reported that some people are brewing a proposal to form a so-called "Caribbean Committee" composed of the United States, Brazil, Chile, and Peru to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries in the Caribbean region. Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa has already pointed out that the proposal itself violates the principle of non-interference.

At the first day of the meeting, Chilean Foreign Minister Vergara was elected as the chairman of the meeting.

The meeting unanimously adopted the following proposal of the Cuban delegation: all plenary sessions and meetings of the General Affairs Committee will be held publicly.

　　拉丁美洲公众一致声援古巴
　　赫脱在美洲外长会议上威胁欺骗并施
    据新华社哈瓦那12日电　拉丁美洲国家公众反对美国通过在智利召开的美洲外长会议干涉古巴的阴谋。
    据拉丁美洲通讯社12日报道，乌拉圭众议院宣布：“乌拉圭议会向外长会议表示它对古巴和委内瑞拉人民及其现政府兄弟般的支持，希望采取措施反对和孤立独裁政权，因为这些独裁政权的存在是美洲大陆的耻辱。”
    在萨尔瓦多，工人联合会、萨尔瓦多争取拉丁美洲团结协会等组织作出决议，要求美洲外长会议采取措施把尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和巴拉圭这些独裁政权的代表从美洲国家组织里驱逐出去。
    在巴西，工党众议员马加良斯就美洲外长会议发表声明指出，所有那些指望使拉丁美洲国家从美国得到更多的援助的会议，从来没有取得预期的成果。只有在召开拉丁美洲国家的会议来提出它们的问题和靠它们自己的资金解决问题的时候，才能获得圆满的成就。
    在哥斯达黎加的首都及主要城市，张贴了这样一些标语：“滚出古巴去”，“古巴革命万岁”。11日晚上，在萨格拉达卡米利亚区举行了有国内知名人士参加的支持古巴革命的集会，并且通过了道义上支持古巴革命的电文，此外还成立了支持古巴委员会。
    在厄瓜多尔，瓜阿斯省社会党领袖阿亚耳·努涅斯表示支持古巴人民，并强烈谴责了泛美主义。阿亚耳·努涅斯说，拉丁美洲应该要求恢复波多黎各的独立和要求美国结束对维尔京群岛的殖民统治。他接着说，厄瓜多尔人民和古巴弟兄站在一起保卫拉丁美洲的民族主权。
    “秘鲁争取多米尼加共和国、尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭解放委员会”也谴责美国操纵的外长会议对古巴可能发动的集体干涉，并且要求拉丁美洲国家同独裁政权断绝关系。
    11日来自加拉加斯的消息说，尼加拉瓜革命领袖吉列尔莫·乌尔维纳·巴斯克斯博士向记者发表谈话，谴责有人企图通过外长会议在古巴重演危地马拉事件。
    新华社13日讯　圣地亚哥消息：美洲外长会议12日在智利首都卡雷拉旅馆举行了第一次全体会议。
    智利总统亚历山德里致开幕词。他谈到智利捍卫互不干涉的原则，但并不意味着宽恕独裁政权。亚历山德里还说，这次会议在讨论加勒比地区局势时必须小心，不要侵犯有关国家的主权。
    亚历山德里还对赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的互相访问表示欢迎。
    美国国务卿赫脱接着在会上发表演说，大谈其美国一手制造的“泛美体系”的“良好作用”，并且说，目前“泛美体系正面临着历史上的一个极关重要的时刻”。他还吹嘘美洲的什么“睦邻关系”和“经济合作”，虽然谁都知道，除了美国对拉丁美洲各国的干涉和掠夺以外，美国和拉丁美洲国家之间并不存在什么美妙的“睦邻”和“合作”关系。
    赫脱威胁说，召开美洲外长会议“这件事本身就证明（泛美体系）存在着危机”，因此必须“进行集体的努力”来“对付危机”。他警告说，美国“不会让自己受到欺骗，而不把（加勒比地区的）混乱征象当做一回事”。赫脱还别有用心地强调“美洲国家组织”的所谓“集体安全原则”。大家知道，美国干涉拉丁美洲国家的许多劣迹正是一贯在“集体安全”招牌下干出来的。
    据悉，有人正在酝酿提出一项议案，建议由美国、巴西、智利、秘鲁四国组成一个所谓“加勒比委员会”来干涉加勒比地区各国内政。古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚已经指出，这个建议本身就违反了互不干涉的原则。
    在第一天会议上，智利外交部长贝尔加拉当选为会议主席。
    会议一致通过了古巴代表团的下列提案：各次全体会议和总务委员会的会议都公开举行。
