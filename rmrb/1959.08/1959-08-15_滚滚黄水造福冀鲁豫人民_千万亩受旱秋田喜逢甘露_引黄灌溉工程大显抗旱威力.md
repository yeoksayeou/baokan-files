Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th: The Yellow River diversion irrigation canals, sluice gates, and inverted siphons built along the lower reaches of the Yellow River in recent years are currently demonstrating their enormous power in the fight against drought, enabling the irrigation of millions of mu of drought-stricken farmland in Henan Province, southwestern and northern Shandong, and southern Hebei.

Starting from the emergence of drought in July in the vast areas along the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the sixteen sluice gates and thirty-eight locations with a total of one hundred and seventy-one inverted siphons, which have been built over the past few years, have successively released water. This Yellow River diversion irrigation covers a very wide area, stretching from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains in northern Henan in the west, to the north bank of the Shaying River, a major tributary of the Huai River, in the south, to the west bank of Weishan Lake in Shandong Province in the east, and reaching the suburbs of Tianjin in Hebei Province, thousands of miles away in the north. According to statistics up to August 10th, the total amount of water supplied by the Yellow River to various large and small irrigation areas through these water conservancy facilities was 2.659 billion cubic meters. Apart from a portion used to ensure normal navigation on some rivers in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei, the vast majority of the released water was transported to various Yellow River diversion irrigation areas. According to incomplete statistics, the area irrigated by Yellow River water had reached over 10 million mu in Henan Province by August 8th, and in Shandong Province, the Weishan Yellow River diversion irrigation area alone had reached 4.89 million mu by early August; some irrigation areas have already watered their farmland two to three times.

The Yellow River diversion irrigation canals, sluice gates, and inverted siphons were mostly newly built last year. Although some mountain canals have not yet been fully completed due to the massive scale of the project, and the canal systems are not yet complete, they have already demonstrated the power to overcome disasters in the recent drought. The People's Victory Canal, the first Yellow River diversion irrigation canal in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, has expanded its irrigated area year by year since it released water in 1952. This year, it has expanded from the original designed irrigated area of 360,000 mu to nearly 1.1 million mu due to good management. The new irrigation canals built last year, such as the Qinchang Communist Canal and the Fengqiu Dagong Red Flag Canal, located west of the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, have recently had an inflow rate of around 200 cubic meters per second. Part of the water from the Communist Canal irrigated hundreds of thousands of mu of autumn seedlings in Wuzhi, Huojia, Huaxian, and Junxian counties in northern Henan, and also sent 100 to 170 cubic meters per second of flow from the Wei River to the Yellow River diversion irrigation areas in northwestern Shandong and Hebei Province every day. The Dagong Red Flag Canal has irrigated 3 million mu of autumn fields in Fengqiu, Changyuan, Puyang, Huaxian, Qingfeng, Nanle, and Neihuang counties in northern Henan. The Sanyizhai People's Leap Forward Canal (with the head sluice gate in Lankao County, Henan Province), which was built last year through the cooperation of Henan and Shandong provinces, has not only irrigated more than 1.8 million mu of autumn seedlings in Lankao, Minquan, Shangqiu, Ningling, Qixian, and Suixian counties and cities in the eastern Henan plain, but also supplied water to the Taihangdi Reservoir in southwestern Shandong, which then distributes the water to various irrigation areas in Caoxian, Chengwu, Heze, Shanxian, and Jinxiang counties. The Dayuzhang, Handun, and Mazhazi Yellow River diversion irrigation canals and sluice gates in the Zibo area of Shandong Province, and the twenty-four inverted siphons in Huimin, Zouping, Guangrao, and other counties, divert Yellow River water to irrigate and lift water to irrigate more than 100,000 mu every day.

Various Yellow River diversion irrigation areas have also adopted many measures to maximize the benefits of the irrigation canals and expand the irrigated area as much as possible. Zhengzhou City, following the instructions of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, dredged the main canal of the Gangli Dongfeng Canal, which had been silted up by Yellow River sediment, ensuring the water supply for the irrigation areas in the suburbs of Zhengzhou and the Kaifeng and Xuchang Special Zones. Combining drought resistance and seedling protection, various localities have also tried their best to build permanent control projects to gradually systematize the canals. (Attached picture)

　　滚滚黄水造福冀鲁豫人民　千万亩受旱秋田喜逢甘露
　　引黄灌溉工程大显抗旱威力
    新华社郑州14日电　近几年来在黄河下游两岸修建的引黄灌溉渠闸和虹吸管，目前在抗旱斗争中显示出了巨大威力，使河南省、鲁西南、鲁北和河北南部的千万亩受旱农田得到了灌溉。
    黄河下游两岸的广大地区，从7月份旱象露头开始，几年来修建的十六座闸门和三十八处共一百七十一道虹吸管就先后放水。这次引黄灌溉的面积非常广阔，西起豫北的太行山脚下，南到淮河大支流沙河北岸，东到山东省微山湖西岸，北达千里外的河北省天津市郊区。到8月10日的统计：黄河通过这些水利设施供应给各大小灌区的水量，共有二十六点五九亿立方米。放出的这些水，除了一部分用来保证河南、山东、河北的一些河道正常通航以外，绝大部分都输送到了各个引黄灌区。引用黄河水灌溉的面积，据不完全统计：河南省到8月8日已达一千多万亩，山东省仅位山引黄灌区到8月初已达四百八十九万亩；有些灌区的农田已经浇了两遍到三遍水。
    引黄灌溉渠闸和虹吸管，绝大部分是去年新建的。虽然因为工程浩大，有的山渠道还没有全部完成，渠道系统还不完整，但是在最近的抗旱中，已经显示出战胜灾害的威力。黄河下游第一个引黄灌渠——人民胜利渠，从1952年放水后，因为管理工作做得好，灌溉面积逐年扩大，到今年，已从原设计灌溉面积三十六万亩扩大到近一百一十万亩。去年建成的新灌渠，如位于京广铁路郑州黄河大桥西侧的秦厂共产主义渠和封丘大功红旗渠，最近引水流量常在二百秒立方米上下。共产主义渠的一部分水灌溉了豫北武陟、获嘉、滑县、浚县等县几十万亩秋苗，每天又把一百到一百七十秒立方米的流量从卫河送往鲁西北和河北省的引黄灌区。大功红旗渠已灌溉了豫北的封丘、长垣、濮阳、滑县、清丰、南乐、内黄等县三百万亩秋田。河南和山东两省在去年协作建成的三义寨人民跃进渠（渠首闸在河南省兰考县），不但已浇了豫东平原兰考、民权、商丘、宁陵、杞县、睢县等县市一百八十多万亩秋苗，还供应给鲁西南的太行堤水库以水源，再由太行堤水库将水分送给曹县、成武、菏泽、单县、金乡等县境的各灌区。山东省淄博地区的打渔张、韩墩、马扎子等引黄灌溉渠闸，惠民、邹平、广饶等县的二十四道虹吸管，每天引黄灌溉和提水灌溉十万多亩。
    各引黄灌区还采取许多措施，发挥灌渠应有效益，尽量扩大灌溉面积。郑州市遵照河南省委的指示，疏浚被黄河泥沙淤浅了的岗李东风渠总干渠，保证了郑州市郊和开封、许昌两个专区各灌区的用水。结合抗旱保苗，各地还尽量修建永久性的控制工程，使渠道逐步系统化。（附图片）
