Since the Great Leap Forward in tea production last year, both the Party and the masses have gained a profound understanding of the potential for increasing autumn tea production, and have also accumulated rich experience in adopting key measures for increasing autumn tea production. Various localities have also created many examples of autumn tea exceeding spring tea in yield, setting a banner for striving for a bumper autumn tea harvest this year. Secondly, China's tea-producing areas are widely distributed, with the southernmost tea areas close to the tropical climate, where tea can be picked all year round. Even in the northern tea areas, such as Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, if the tea picked after August is counted as autumn tea, there are more than three months of production season throughout the year, which is much longer than the spring tea production period. Third, autumn tea production occurs after the late rice transplanting, the labor situation is relatively relaxed, and the autumn tea production season is long and the output is not very concentrated, so a certain amount of labor can be drawn to establish professional teams to patrol and harvest in batches, or concentrate forces to harvest in stages.

To strive for a bumper autumn tea harvest, we must give full play to the favorable conditions for autumn tea production and firmly grasp the following key points for increasing production.

Timely Summer Cultivation and Diligent Weed Removal

In various tea-producing areas in China, there is a common tea garden management experience, which is: "Digging in July is gold," "Digging in August is silver," also known as "Summer Cultivation." Summer cultivation should be carried out before mid-August, choosing sunny and windless weather, and according to the terrain and soil conditions (shallow on slopes, deeper on plains, shallow on sandy soil, deeper on clay soil), the cultivation depth is about five to eight inches. In areas with steep slopes and severe soil erosion, only shallow cultivation and weed removal are suitable, and deep cultivation is not allowed. Farmers in the Hangzhou area of Zhejiang have the experience that: when doing summer cultivation, the dug-up clods should stand upright, and should not be broken up and harrowed. After being exposed to the scorching sun, the clods will naturally loosen and all the weed roots will be killed. At this time, if there are showers, the tea trees will grow particularly well. Farmers say this is "more effective than fertilization." The main advantage of summer cultivation is that it improves the soil structure and the state of nutrients, increases the available nutrients in the soil, and changes the soil air and water conditions, which is conducive to the growth and development of autumn tea. In addition to the above advantages, summer cultivation can also remove deep-rooted weeds, such as cogon grass and Indocalamus tessellatus, reducing weeds' competition for soil nutrients and water. Weeds have a great impact on tea trees. Farmers have the impression of the harm of autumn grass: "Rather reduce one application of fertilizer, than let a season of grass grow old." However, when doing summer cultivation, attention should be paid to using four-tooth or two-tooth harrows, and iron hoes should not be used, so as not to damage the root system too much. If it is a newly developed row-style densely planted tea garden, deep cultivation should be avoided during summer cultivation, and soil loosening and weed removal should be the main focus.

Apply Topdressing Fertilizer in Stages and at Appropriate Times

In the past year, the distribution of tea production in China was mostly concentrated in the spring and summer seasons, especially with the spring tea accounting for the largest proportion. This is inseparable from the past emphasis on tea garden fertilization and management before spring tea. The experience of the Great Leap Forward in tea production in 1958 tells us that with the strengthening of tea garden fertilization and management in summer and autumn, the yield of summer tea can catch up with spring tea, and autumn tea can even exceed spring tea. Why is this possible? One of the main reasons is the application of topdressing fertilizer in stages and at appropriate times. Autumn tea garden fertilization should adopt a method of combining multiple applications with root and foliar applications. Generally, for soil fertilization, topdressing fertilizer can be applied one to three times depending on the length of the tea season and the fertilizer source, mainly with fast-acting nitrogen fertilizers, such as pig manure, human manure, and ammonium sulfate (it is more appropriate to mix with water and apply on sunny days). In mountainous tea gardens with sufficient grass resources nearby, the "burying green manure" method can be used more. According to the experience of farmers in Pujiang, Zhejiang, burying ten kilograms of green grass for each tea bush can increase tea production by 72.3% throughout the year, with the most significant increase in autumn tea. Foliar fertilization is not only significantly increasing production, but also has the special effects of locally improving the microclimate of the tea garden and improving the quality of tea. According to local experience, foliar fertilization with 0.5%-1% urea, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium nitrate chemical fertilizers sprayed on all tea bushes in the morning and evening, once every three to five days, has the best effect. During the spring tea season this year, farmers in Qimen, Anhui, and Hangzhou, Zhejiang, used foliar fertilization methods, which increased production by 10% to 30%, and the buds and leaves were plump and not easy to age.

Cover the Rows with Grass to Retain Water and Prevent Drought

During the tea production season, the soil moisture should be maintained at about 60%. However, in the main tea-producing areas of China, autumn drought is relatively common due to high temperatures and low rainfall in autumn. The problems of autumn drought reflected in tea tree production are: weak budding, short shoots, thin leaves, premature aging, and even cessation of growth. Therefore, covering the rows with grass to retain water and prevent drought is a highly effective and feasible measure to increase autumn tea production. In 1958, the tea production of the Changdong Production Team of the Xindeng Commune in Tonglu County, Zhejiang, increased by 1.2 times compared with 1957. The autumn tea this year was equal to 173.5% of the spring tea production. One of their main experiences in tea garden management is to affirm the effect of laying grass in tea gardens. The area of tea gardens covered with grass in the team accounted for more than 80% of the total area, and each mu was covered with about 3,000 kilograms of grass (including "mountain green manure," bean stalks, and wheat straw). According to the comparative measurements made by this team on two representative tea gardens under the same conditions, the tea gardens covered with grass increased production by three times more than those not covered with grass. The buds and leaves of tea trees covered with grass have a high density and grow fast, which can advance the tea picking time and there is no scorched leaf phenomenon. They summarized the benefits of laying grass in tea gardens. In addition to retaining water and preventing drought, it can also protect slopes from erosion, reduce weed growth, and keep the tea garden soil loose for a long time. After the covered grass rots and is plowed into the soil, it also enriches the organic matter content of the soil and improves soil fertility.

Pick Tea in Multiple Times and in a Timely Manner

Autumn tea can greatly exert its potential production power when it is "well-fed and watered." The buds and leaves not only grow more, but also grow faster. It must be picked diligently and in a timely manner to ensure increased production and improved quality, and to promote the continuous germination of new buds.

Last year, some areas used the method of picking old leaves all at once or "picking with stems" when picking autumn tea. Because autumn shoots are generally not strong, and after leaving the stems, they cannot continue to sprout in the same year, most of them become branches with very poor germination power or the entire branch dies in the following spring. This must be prevented.

How to achieve timely and diligent picking is the key to ensuring a bumper harvest. In addition to ensuring that quotas are set and bonuses are awarded for exceeding quotas in the system, the double-handed fast tea picking method must be vigorously promoted technically. Concentrate your thoughts, coordinate your hands and eyes, stagger your hands, and pick tea in order. Generally, after tea picking women are trained and adopt the double-handed fast tea picking method, the efficiency can be increased by more than double.

In increasing the production of autumn tea, attention must be paid to preventing two deviations: one is not daring to boldly pick autumn tea, which is manifested in closing the garden and stopping picking prematurely; the other is to indefinitely delay picking, and picking all new and old leaves regardless of the conditions.

Under certain natural conditions, as long as the tea trees are strengthened in cultivation and management, they can be picked more and sprout more. Diligently picking tea and picking more tea is the purpose of cultivating tea trees, and it also conforms to the law of tea tree growth. Picking autumn tea can be done until the last batch of new shoots is issued, provided that a certain number of new leaves sprouted in spring or summer of the same year and reasonable nutrition are maintained. Of course, young tea trees that have not reached the picking standard, as well as tea trees that have been newly cut back or heavily pruned, should be picked less due to the need for "cultivating the canopy." The result of this harvesting is that it can not only increase the production of autumn tea, but also maintain the growth advantage of tea trees, so that tea production can be maintained on a high-yield and stable basis. Therefore, not daring to boldly pick autumn tea is a conservative approach; indefinitely delaying picking and picking all the new and old leaves is also against the nature of tea trees. Moreover, the autumn tea produced in this way cannot meet the needs of the market, and may increase costs and outweigh the gains.

Prune Dead Branches and Apply Sufficient Base Fertilizer

Tea trees are perennial plants, and the spring harvest is very early. Early management has a decisive effect on increasing production that year. Therefore, while striving to increase autumn tea production, we must strengthen cultivation and management to lay the foundation for a greater leap forward next year.

Due to the metabolism of tea trees, or unreasonable picking management, there are often dead, diseased, coarse, or old branches, or branches parasitized by various diseases and insect pests. These branches should be completely pruned off at the end of the tea season (at the latest before November) to promote branch renewal and concentrated nutritional growth, and to reduce the spread of diseases and insect pests.

Autumn deep plowing and applying sufficient base fertilizer have a great relationship with increasing production next year. This work should be completed in September or no later than October. The autumn deep plowing should generally be eight inches to one foot two inches deep, depending on the depth of the soil layer or the distribution of the root system. It is necessary to gradually deepen from the foot of the bush to the row (young tea trees should not be plowed too deeply). Deep plowing and applying base fertilizer must be carried out in combination. Fertilizers that are large in quantity but poor in quality should be applied in layers. Base fertilizer is mainly organic slow-release nitrogen fertilizer, and should be properly combined with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. In areas with the habit of soil cultivation, the surface soil under the forest should be selected as the soil for cultivation.

Grasp the key to increasing production, focus on increasing autumn tea production, correctly grasp the technology of picking autumn tea, and we will be able to increase the production of more autumn tea, and at the same time lay a good foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

    保证秋茶丰产丰收的关键
    中国农业科学院茶叶研究所
    今年春夏茶生产，在去年大跃进的基础上，又获得了丰收。湖南、安徽、四川、云南等省，增产5％到二成多不等。
    增产秋茶的有利条件是很多的，首先是从去年茶叶生产大跃进以来，党和群众不仅对秋茶增产的潜力有了深刻的认识，对采用增产秋茶的关键性措施，也取得了丰富的经验。各地并且创造了许多秋茶超春茶的丰产范例，为争取今年秋茶丰产丰收树立了旗帜。其次是我国茶区分布甚广，最南茶区和热带气候相近，可以全年采茶，即使是北部茶区，如浙江、安徽等省，如果将8月以后所采的茶叶算做秋茶，全年也有三个月以上的生产季节，远比春茶生产时期为长。第三，秋茶处在晚稻插秧以后，劳力情况比较缓和，而且秋茶生产季节长，产量不甚集中，可以抽出一定劳力建立专业队，分批巡回采收，或集中力量分期突击采收。
    争取秋茶丰产丰收，必须充分发挥秋茶生产的有利条件，紧紧抓着下面这些增产关键。
    及时伏耕，勤除杂草
    我国各地茶区，都有一个共同的茶园管理经验，就是：“七挖金”，“八挖银”，也叫“伏耕”。伏耕应在8月中旬以前进行，选择晴朗无风的天气，根据地势和土壤情况（坡地宜浅，平地较深，沙土宜浅，粘土较深），耕深五—八寸左右，遇有陡坡土壤冲蚀严重的地方，只宜浅耕除草，不能深耕。浙江杭州地区农民的经验是：伏耕时要让挖起的泥垡直立，不能打碎耙平，经过烈日照晒以后，泥垡自然疏散，草根全部晒死，这时遇有阵雨，茶树生长特别良好。农民说这“比施肥还灵”。伏耕的主要优点是改善了土壤的结构和营养物质的状态，增加了土壤中的可给态营养的物质，改变了土壤空气和水分状况，因而有利于秋茶的生长发育，伏耕除具有上述优点以外，还能除去深根的杂草，如茅草、莠竹等，减少杂草对土壤养料和水分的争夺。杂草对茶树的影响很大。农民对秋草危害的印象是：“宁可少施一遍肥，不可养老一季草”。但伏耕时应注意选用四齿或两齿钉耙，不可使用铁锄，以免多伤根系。如果是新发展的条列式密植茶园，伏耕时应避免深耕，以松土除草为主。
        分期适时追肥
    我国过去一年中茶叶产量的分布，多集中在春、夏两季，特别是以春茶所占的比重为最大，这是和以往重视春茶以前的茶园施肥管理等情况分不开的。1958年茶叶生产大跃进的经验告诉我们，在加强夏、秋季茶园施肥管理的情况下，夏茶产量可以赶春茶，秋茶更可以超过春茶。为什么能这样呢？主要原因之一就是分期适时追肥。秋季茶园施肥应该采用分次施和根下、根外施相结合的方法。一般对土壤施肥，可视茶季长短和肥源情况追肥一到三次，以速效氮肥为主，如猪、人粪，硫酸铵等（在晴天掺水施用，较为适宜）。高山茶园附近草源充足的，可多采用“埋青”的办法。浙江浦江农民的经验，每丛茶树埋青草十斤，全年可增产茶叶72.3％，其中以秋茶增产最为显著。根外施肥不仅增产显著，还有局部改良茶园小气候和提高茶叶品质的特殊作用。根据各地经验，根外施肥以0.5％—1％的尿素、硫酸铵或硝酸铵等化学肥在早晚喷湿全部茶丛，每隔三到五天喷施一次，效果最好。安徽祁门和浙江杭州农民今年春茶时期由于采用根外施肥方法，产量增加一到三成，而且芽叶肥壮，不易变老。
    行间盖草，保水防旱
    茶叶在生产季节，土壤湿度应经常保持在60％左右，但在我国的主要茶区，由于秋季温度高，雨量少，因此秋旱现象比较普遍。秋旱反映在茶树生产上的问题是：萌芽不旺，新梢梗短、叶薄，未大先老，甚至发生停止生长的现象。因此，在茶树行间盖草，保水防旱，是增产秋茶效力高而又切实可行的措施。浙江桐庐县新登公社昌东生产队1958年茶叶比1957年增产一点二倍，这年秋茶等于春茶产量的173.5％。他们在茶园管理上的主要一条经验就是肯定了茶园铺草的效果，全队铺草茶园的面积占总面积80％以上，每亩铺草（包括各施“山青”、豆秆、麦草等）约三千斤。根据这个队在相同条件下的两块具有代表性的茶园所做的对比测定，铺草比不铺草的茶园增产达三倍之多；铺草的茶树芽叶密度大，长得快，能够提早采茶，且无焦叶现象。他们总结茶园铺草的好处，除保水防旱外，且能护坡防冲，减少杂草生长，使茶园土壤长期保持疏松状态。在盖草腐烂翻耕入土后，又丰富了土壤有机质含量，提高了土壤肥力。
    分次及时采茶
    秋茶在“吃饱喝足”的情况下就可以大大发挥其生产的潜在力量，芽叶不仅发得多，而且长得快，必须及时勤采，才能保证增产和提高品质，并促进新芽的不断萌发。
    去年有些地区在采秋茶的时候用养老后一次捋采或“留梗采”的方法，由于秋梢一般都不粗壮，而且留梗后当年不能继续抽芽，今年春季多半成为萌芽力极差的枝条或者整枝死去，必须注意防止。
    怎样达到及时勤采，这是保证丰产丰收的关键所在。除在制度上应做到确定定额，进行超额奖励以外，在技术上必须大力推广双手快速采茶法。做到思想集中，手眼配合，双手交错，顺序采茶。一般采茶妇女经过训练，采用双手快速采茶法以后，可提高效率一倍以上。
    在增产秋茶当中，必须注意防止两种偏向：一种是不敢大胆采摘秋茶，表现在过早地封园停采；另一种是无限期地延迟采摘，不分条件地把新老叶全部采光。
    茶树在一定的自然条件下，只要加强培育管理，可以做到采得多、发得多。勤采茶、多采茶，是栽培茶树的目的，也符合茶树生长的规律。采秋茶在保有一定数量的当年春季或夏季萌发新叶和合理的营养条件下，就可以采至最后发出的一批新梢为止。当然，对未达到采摘标准的幼年茶树，以及新近台刈或重修前的茶树，由于“养蓬”的需要，应该少采一些。这样采收的结果，既可增产秋茶，又可维持茶树生长的优势，使茶叶产量保持在既高产又稳定的基础上。因此，不敢大胆采秋茶，是保守的作法；无限期地延迟采摘，把新梢老叶全部采光的做法，也是违反茶树生活本性的，况且这样增产出来的秋茶，也不能符合市场的需要，还可能加大成本，得不偿失。剪除枯枝，施足基肥
    茶树是多年生植物，春季收获甚早，前期管理对当年增产具有决定作用。因此，必须在力争秋茶增产的同时，加强培育管理，为明年更大跃进打下基础。
    茶树由于新陈代谢作用，或者是采摘管理上的不合理，经常出现有枯病粗老枝条或者出现各种病虫害寄生的枝条。这些枝条应该在茶季基本结束时（最迟在11月以前）全部剪去，促使枝条的更新和营养生长的集中，以及减少病虫害的传播。
    秋季深耕、施足基肥，对明年增产关系很大。这一工作，应抓紧在9月或不迟于10月以前完成。秋季深耕应视土层深浅或根系分布情况一般耕深八寸至一尺二寸为宜。并需由丛脚向行间逐步加深（幼龄茶树，则不宜耕得过深）。深耕和施基肥必须结合进行。数量多质量较差的肥料，应该分层施用。基肥以有机迟效氮肥为主，并须适当配合磷、钾肥料，有培土习惯的地区，应选林地下面的表土为培土。
    抓牢增产关键，以增产秋茶为主，正确的掌握采摘秋茶的技术，就一定能够增产更多的秋茶，同时打好明年丰产基础。
