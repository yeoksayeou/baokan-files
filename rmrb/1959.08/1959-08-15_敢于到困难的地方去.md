Dare to Go to Difficult Places
　　Yi Huai

　　Mo Youtian, Deputy Director of Xindi Commune in Cangwu County, is a good steward for the masses. The masses say, with Mo Youtian, everything is to our liking, and we work with extra energy. This is the highest reward for a Communist Party member and a revolutionary worker!

　　This reward is not easy to come by, and Mo Youtian deserves it. This reward is not only because he has many good ideas for his work, but mainly because of his red heart as a Communist Party member who cares for and loves the masses. Mo Youtian took the initiative to request the commune party committee to send him to Huilong, a relatively backward place. He was determined to help those few backward production teams catch up with the advanced; he established a deep friendship with the masses in this backward place. This aspiration is the true great aspiration of a Communist Party member, and this feeling is the true deep affection of a Communist Party member for the masses.

　　For those advanced, prosperous places where all work is relatively smooth, we Communist Party members will naturally feel full of joy, leading them to make everything even better. For backward, impoverished places full of difficulties, we will have deeper concern and a greater sense of responsibility, eagerly hoping to contribute our own strength to changing the backwardness of these places. This kind of feeling is especially commendable. This is a concrete manifestation of the noble character of Communist Party members who worry about the world before others and enjoy the world after others, and it is also the most profound mass viewpoint. At present, this spirit is particularly worthy of promotion. Some places have good weather, while others are threatened by disasters; some places have lighter threats of disasters, while others have severe threats of disasters. No matter where the work is, we should all care about it. But we should especially care about those places with heavy disasters and many difficulties. We should, like Mo Youtian, take the initiative to request to go to the places with the most difficulties, and lead the masses to overcome difficulties and defeat disasters!

　　To go to the most difficult places, you must have enthusiasm and great aspirations. To go to advanced places and make the advanced even more advanced is a good aspiration. To go to backward and difficult places, this aspiration is especially worth learning. Facing difficulties, knowing the difficulties and moving forward requires great perseverance and fearless spirit. Courage is essential, but personal courage alone is not enough to overcome difficulties. Personal courage and perseverance must be combined with the strength of the masses. Like Mo Youtian, give your heart to the masses and take root deeply in the masses, so that you can continuously absorb moisture and nutrients from the fertile soil of the masses. This is an inexhaustible source of strength and the most reliable guarantee for overcoming difficulties.

　　敢于到困难的地方去
　　易槐
    苍梧县新地公社副主任莫有天是群众的好当家人，群众说，有了莫有天，做什么都合我们心意，我们干起活来格外有劲。这是对于一个共产党人、革命工作者的最高奖偿！
    这个奖偿得来不易，莫有天也当之无愧。得来这个奖偿，不仅是因为他工作的办法多主意好，最主要的还是他那一颗共产党员的关心群众热爱群众的赤心。莫有天是主动请求公社党委把他派到回龙那个比较落后的地方去的。他立志要帮助那几个落后的生产队赶上先进；他和这个落后地方的群众建立起深厚的情谊。这志向，是共产党人的真正的大志，这感情，是共产党人对群众的真正深情。
    对于那些先进的、富裕的、一切工作都比较顺利的地方，我们共产党人自然会感到满心喜悦，领导他们把一切变得更加美好。对于落后贫困、困难重重的地方，则会有更深切的关怀，更重大的责任感，迫切地希望能够为改变这些地方的落后面貌贡献自己的力量。这种感情尤为难能可贵。这是共产党人先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐的崇高品德的具体表现，也是最深刻的群众观点。在当前，这种精神尤其值得提倡。有的地方风调雨顺，有的地方受到灾害的威胁；有的地方灾害的威胁较轻，有的地方灾害的威胁严重。不论那里的工作，我们都应当关心。但是尤其应当关心那些灾害重、困难多的地方。应当像莫有天那样，主动地请求到困难最多的地方去，领导群众克服困难战胜灾害！
    到最困难的地方去，要有热情，还要有大志。到先进的地方去，使先进的更加先进，这是好志向。到落后的困难多的地方，这志向尤其值得学习。面对困难，知难而进，需要的是多么大的毅力和无畏气概。勇气是必不可少的，但是，仅凭个人的勇气还不足以克服困难。个人的勇气和毅力必须和群众的力量相结合。像莫有天那样，把心交给群众，在群众中深深地札下根去，就可以从群众这肥沃的土壤中，不断地吸取水分养料。这是力量的无尽的泉源，战胜困难的最可靠的保证。
