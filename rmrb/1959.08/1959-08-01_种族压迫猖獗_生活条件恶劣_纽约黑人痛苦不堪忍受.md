Rampant Racial Oppression, Harsh Living Conditions
New York Blacks Endure Unbearable Suffering

The situation in New York's Harlem black residential area has become so acute and tense that the latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report" gave an article about Harlem the meaningful title: "Is New York Sitting on a Powder Keg?"

The article reflects the growing fear of the American ruling class, a fear caused by the growing anger of black residents over their miserable living conditions. The magazine wrote: "The tension is surfacing. Black resistance movements are developing more and more. Clashes between police and black demonstrators occur frequently. Harlem is turbulent. Here, the tide of racial conflict is rising, threatening America's largest and wealthiest city."

The magazine, standing on its well-known racist stance, attempts to frighten readers with the possibility of "black riots."

The magazine talks about Harlem tenants demonstrating against white landlords because the landlords refuse to repair houses and improve the sanitary conditions of rat-infested residences.

    文章中反映了美国统治集团日益增长的恐惧，这种恐惧是由于黑人居民对他们的悲惨生活条件越来越表示愤怒而引起的。杂志写道：“紧张状况正在表面化。黑人的抵制运动越来越发展了。警察和黑人示威游行者经常发生冲突。哈莱姆区动荡不安。这里，种族冲突的浪潮日益高涨，威胁着这个美国最大和最富有的城市。”
    这家杂志站在它的众所周知的种族主义立场上，企图用可能发生“黑人暴动”的说法来恐吓读者。
    杂志谈到哈莱姆房客反对白人房东的示威，因为房东拒绝修理房子和改善老鼠成群的住宅的卫生状况。黑人乘客不满公共汽车的白人司机歧视黑人、态度粗暴，他们很可能抵制第五号大街公共汽车公司的汽车。黑人学生的家长拒绝把孩子送到黑人孩子占多数的学校，因为这些学校比白人学校条件坏……
