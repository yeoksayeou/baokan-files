　　The Story of Eliminating Evil in Dengcheng
　　Lu Yanling, Deputy Secretary of the Huang Fan District State-Owned Farm Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    In 1947, the Liberation War was raging fiercely.
    The suffering of the people in the Huang Fan District seemed endless. After the floodwaters receded, those who had fled returned to their hometowns, enduring hunger and starvation, trying to rebuild their homes on a desolate land with their own hands. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries did not let them go, extorting endlessly, trying to squeeze oil even from dry bones.
    In Dengcheng Village, the Kuomintang had set up a township office, stationed with forty or fifty township soldiers. These guys thought that the village was close to the south bank of the Sha River and the terrain was dangerous, so the People's Liberation Army would not come to fight. They often ran to the north bank of the Sha River to extort money, rape women, and forcibly enlist men... causing chaos and unrest.
    At that time, a guerrilla unit of ours was stationed not far from Dengcheng. One day, several old folks came and told us in detail about the crimes of the puppet township office, asking us to send troops to fight and avenge the people.
    "It's no trouble at all to beat them," they said in unison, "These guys play cards, roll dice, drink, smoke opium, and play with women every night, making noise until late at night, and don't sleep until morning." Then they described in detail the terrain of the village and the distribution of the enemy. They volunteered to lead the troops.
    After reconnaissance, we decided to take action.
    It was a moonless night, and the troops were moving slowly. The road was difficult to walk. The silt pools formed after the flooding had not completely disappeared, and one would sink in if one was not careful. The horses were struggling to walk on the sand and almost sank into the silt pools several times. We had to leave the horses behind. By the time we reached the Sha River, the sky was already slightly bright, and the village walls of Dengcheng could be vaguely seen across the river.
    It was almost dawn, could we still attack? We considered this question.
    The guides, the local people, said, "Yes, they must still be sleeping like dead pigs."
    So, led by the villagers, the troops waded across the Sha River.
    Suddenly, there was a gunshot, and we were startled. It turned out that an enemy sentry had discovered us. He fired a shot and ran away. We rushed up in one charge.
    There were no other sentries in the village, and the gunshot was not noticed in the village. The people led us quickly to the place where the township soldiers lived. The door was tightly closed, with iron sheets embedded in it, very strong. A burst of snoring came from inside.
    What should we do? We were a little anxious.
    An old villager said, "It doesn't matter. There is a miller in the village who grinds flour for them every day. Let's find him to call the door."
    The miller was found, and he shook the knocker and shouted, "Open the door, the flour is here."
    There was a rumbling sound inside: "Why is the flour being delivered so early?" Then the door opened with a "creak", a sentry holding a gun, rubbing his eyes, not fully awake yet.
    We snatched his gun and entered the house. The township soldiers were lying haphazardly, sleeping like dead dogs. We shouted, "Don't move!" All forty-odd people obediently became prisoners.
    The township captain was found among the prisoners and forced to call the door of the puppet township head. As a result, the puppet township head was also arrested. In this way, without firing a single shot, we solved this lawless puppet township office and eliminated a scourge for the people of Dengcheng.

　　邓城除害记
　　中共国营黄泛区农场委员会副书记　路岩岭
    1947年，解放战争正在激烈进行。
    黄泛区人民的苦难似乎没有个尽头。黄水消退了，逃亡在外的人，回到了家乡，他们忍饥受饿，苟延残喘，企图在一片荒凉的土地上，用自己的双手重建家园。然而国民党反动派并不放过他们，敲诈勒索无尽无休，要把干骨头也熬出油来。
    在邓城寨子上，国民党设有一个乡公所，驻有乡丁四五十人。这些家伙以为寨子紧靠沙河南岸，形势险要，解放军不会来打，就经常跑到沙河北岸肆无忌惮地勒索钱财，奸淫妇女，拉壮丁……弄得鸡犬不宁，人神不安。
    那时，我们的一支游击部队正驻在离邓城不远的地方。一天，几个老百姓找来了，他们一五一十地向我们控诉伪乡公所的罪恶，要求我们派部队去打，为老百姓报仇雪恨。
    “打他们一点不费事”，他们异口同声地说，“这些家伙每天晚上都打牌掷骰，喝酒，抽大烟，玩女人，一直闹到深夜，不到早晨不睡觉。”接着他们就详细地介绍了寨子的地形，敌人分布的情况。他们自告奋勇要为部队带路。
    我们侦察了一下情况，于是，就决定行动了。
    那是一个没有月亮的晚上，部队缓慢地行进着。路不好走，黄泛后形成的淤潭还没有完全消除，一不小心就陷了下去。马匹在沙地上走着很吃力，有几次几乎陷进淤潭里去。我们只好把马留下了。赶到沙河边时，天已经蒙蒙亮对面邓城的寨墙已经隐约可见。
    天快亮了，能不能打？我们考虑这个问题。
    领路的几个群众说：“行，他们一定还睡得像死猪一样。”
    于是，由老乡们领着，队伍涉过沙河。
    忽然乓的一声枪响，我们吃了一惊，原来是敌人的一个岗哨发现了我们，他开了一枪撒腿便跑。我们一个冲锋冲了上去。
    寨子里另外没有设岗，枪响，寨子里也没有发觉。群众领着我们很快地就找到了乡丁们住的地方。门紧闭着，门上嵌有铁皮，很结实，从门里传来一阵阵的鼾声。
    这怎么办呢？我们有些着急了。
    有个老乡说：“不要紧。寨里有一个磨面的，天天给他们磨面，我们找他去叫门。” 
    磨面的找来了，他摇着门环喊道：“开门呀，送面来了。”
    门里一阵咕噜声：“送面怎么这样早？”接着门“呀”的一声开了，一个哨兵端着枪，揉着眼睛，瞌睡还没醒呢。
    我们劈手夺过了他的枪，进到屋里，乡丁们正横七竖八地躺着，睡得像死狗一样。喊一声：“不准动！”四十几个人都乖乖地当了俘虏。
    从俘虏里查出了乡队长，押着他去叫伪乡长的门。结果伪乡长也被我们抓住了。就这样，我们一枪未发，就把这个无恶不作的伪乡公所解决了，给邓城人民除了一害。
