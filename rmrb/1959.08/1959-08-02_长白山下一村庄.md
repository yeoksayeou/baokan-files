A Village at the Foot of Changbai Mountain
Song Quanlin

Jixing Village is located in a canyon within a branch of the Changbai Mountains, more than ninety *li* away from the county seat of Wangqing in the Autonomous Prefecture. It takes two or three hours to get there by car and on foot. It has a total of fifty-two households and is now an administrative area of the Hongguang People's Commune. Around it, on the large and small mountains, is a dense forest. Every year, a large amount of timber is transported to various places, and it is also rich in various medicinal materials, furs, wild fruits, and other forest by-products. The small stream flowing in front of the village's flatland also nurtures abundant crops and breeds a large number of fish and frogs, bringing infinite wealth to the people. Jixing Village is a good place for agriculture, forestry, and sideline production; it is a beautiful and rich mountain village. Rows of thatched houses with glass windows installed on the snow-white walls shine brightly in the summer sun, and every house is tidied up neatly and cleanly. During the day, the adults are all in the fields, and only the children are playing on the playground of the nursery, and sometimes the sound of reading aloud comes from the elementary school. If it were before liberation, this would be the time when every household was running out of food and money, and everyone would be hoping that the wheat growing in the fields would ripen a day earlier to get through the "wheat ridge" when the old grain was gone and the new grain wasn't ready. Few people would go to the fields, and the children's laughter would not be heard. However, after liberation, through years of effort, this year, at this time, every household in the village has an average of more than 1,000 *jin* of reserve grain and more than 70 yuan in cash deposited in the credit cooperative.

Many traces of suffering have been washed away by people's new lives, but they still vividly remember their situation before liberation. At that time, under the rule of Japanese imperialism, such rich resources could not be developed and utilized by the people. Until September 1945, all twenty households in the village lived in "horse shed" shacks with only one door and one window, which were short and small. People slept on earthen *kang* beds and used wooden stumps as pillows. They could not get clothing. During the day, women could not leave their homes naked, and men wore burlap sacks to work in the fields. Because every household lacked farm tools and livestock, more than fifty people only planted ten hectares of "rabbit-dropping" hillside land. People suffered from hunger and cold year after year, and were constantly plagued by diseases, especially women, who were often ill, and children were few. Therefore, people have always called this ditch "Poor Stick Village."

After liberation, the rich land was returned to the hands of the people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole village launched a mutual aid and cooperation movement, and in accordance with the principle of "relying on the mountain to eat the mountain, and raising the mountain by eating the mountain," they developed a diversified economy in accordance with local conditions, so that agriculture, forestry, and sideline industries have been fully developed, increasing income year by year, improving living standards, and changing "Poor Stick Village" to "Jixing Village." Now, Jixing Village has increased from twenty households before liberation to fifty-two households. Due to the annual addition of more than seventy head of livestock, more than thirty carts, and many farm implements, the cultivated area has also expanded to seventy-four hectares, and it has become a village with a surplus of grain. In addition to plowing and cultivating the land during the agricultural season, they also go into the mountains to cut wood, hunt, dig medicinal materials, pick wild fruits, and catch frogs in winter and during slack seasons; and collectively raise pigs and plant garden ginseng in the village, so production continues throughout the year.

The poor mountain village has become a wealthy mountain village, and every household lives a life of plenty. All fifty-two households have moved into newly built large thatched houses, more than thirty households have installed tap water wells, six households have bought sewing machines, and four households have bought clocks and watches. It is no longer uncommon for young men and women to wear leather shoes and watches. With the continuous improvement of the material living standards, the cultural life of the commune members has also been rapidly popularized and improved. All school-age children have entered the village's elementary school; most adults have removed the label of illiteracy and can read newspapers and write letters. Every household has installed wired broadcast loudspeakers. The village's telephone lines extend to all parts of the Autonomous Prefecture, and the remote mountain village has been transformed into a civilized mountain village in the blink of an eye.

    长白山下一村庄
    宋全林
    吉兴村，座落在长白山支脉的一个峡谷中，距离自治州的汪清县城有九十多里路，连坐汽车带走路两三个小时就可以到。这里共有五十二户人家，现在是红光人民公社的一个管理区。在她周围的大小山上，是一片茂密的大森林，每年都有大批木材运往各地，还盛产名目繁多的药材、皮张、野果等林野副产品。那穿流村前平川地的小溪流，还哺育着丰盛的庄稼，繁殖着大量鱼和蛤蚂等，为人们带来无限的财富。吉兴村是个宜农宜林宜副的好地方，是一个美丽富饶的山村。在雪白的墙上安着玻璃窗的一排排稻草房，迎着夏天的太阳银光耀眼，家家收拾得整齐洁净。白天，大人们都下田了，只有孩子们在托儿所的平场上嬉耍着，有时也从小学校里传出朗朗的读书声。如果是在解放前，这个时候正是家家户户断粮缺钱，都盼着长在地里的麦子早熟一天好过青黄不接的“麦岭”，很少有人下地，也听不到孩子们的嬉笑声。但是，解放以后，经过历年的努力，今年，这个时候，全村每家平均已备有一千多斤机动粮和在信用社里存着七十多元现款。
    许多苦难的痕迹已经被人们新的生活所洗荡无遗，但他们谈起解放前的处境还记忆犹新。那时，在日本帝国主义的统治下，那么丰富的资源，不能被人们所开发和利用。直到1945年9月，全村二十户住的都是只有一门一窗的“马架子”棚，又矮又小。人们睡在土炕上，枕着木头墩。他们得不到衣着，白天妇女赤身露体出不得家门，男人下地干活，围着麻袋片。由于家家都缺农具、缺牲口，五十多口人只拣种了十公顷“兔子不拉屎的”山坡地。人们成年累月受着饥饿和寒冷，还百病不断，特别是妇女多病，儿童稀少。因此，人们一直把这趟沟叫作“穷棒子屯”。
    解放后，富饶的江山还归人民的手里。全村人民在共产党的领导下，开展了互助合作运动，并根据“靠山吃山，吃山养山”的方针，因地制宜地发展了多种经济，使农、林、副业得到了全面发展，逐年增加收入，改善了生活，把“穷棒子屯”也改叫成“吉兴村”了。现在，吉兴村已从解放前的二十户增加到五十二户。由于逐年增添了七十多头牲畜、三十多辆大车和许多农具，耕地面积也扩大到七十四公顷，已经变成了粮食自给有余村。除了在农事季节犁田耕地外，还在冬季和农闲时进山伐木、打猎、挖药材、采野果和捉蛤蚂；并在村里集体养猪、种园参等，生产终年不断。
    穷苦的山村，变成了富裕的山村，家家都过得丰衣足食。五十二户人家都住进了新盖的大草房，已经有三十多家安上了自来水井，有六家买进了缝纫机，有四家买上了坐钟挂表。青年小伙子和姑娘们穿皮鞋、带手表，已不是罕见的事了。随着物质生活水平的不断提高，社员的文化生活也迅速得到普及和提高。全部适龄儿童都已入了村里的小学；多数成年人摘掉了文盲帽子，能够看报写信。家家都安上有线广播喇叭。村里的电话一直通到自治州各地，偏僻的山村转眼间变成为文明的山村。
