The Man Who Conquered the Drought Demon
　　——A Record of Zhu Guancheng’s Model Deeds in Leading the Masses to Fight Drought
　　By Our Correspondents Tian Zhuang and Hu Liebin

Here, we introduce to our readers such a person: From his appearance, he has almost nothing remarkable – a short stature, a thin face, a dark and shiny complexion. But it is he, a man full of enthusiasm and shining with energy, who led the masses to conquer the drought demon and win a bumper harvest of early rice and mid-season rice.

His name is Zhu Guancheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Manan Production Team of the Mashan People's Commune in Jiangling County, Hubei Province. These days, the heroic deeds of Old Zhu in leading the masses to overcome drought have spread like a gust of wind to almost every corner of the entire commune, the entire county, and the entire special zone. Cadres and the masses in many places are launching a surge of "learning from Zhu Guancheng, catching up with Zhu Guancheng," determined to take him as an example, fighting drought every day to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

This is after the early rice drought was fought and a bumper harvest obtained.

In July, the scorching sun was like fire, and the drought became more and more serious. Old Zhu, who had just led the masses to wrest a bumper harvest of early rice from the drought demon, pondered all day long: Although the early rice had a bumper harvest, the area and yield of mid-season rice and single-crop late rice are large and high. As the saying goes, "The mouse pulling the plow, the main part is still behind!"

At that time, Old Zhu checked all the ponds and dams in the team and found that the water currently stored in the ponds and dams could only irrigate two meals of water at most, while according to the growth needs of mid-season rice, at least seven meals of water were needed. This branch secretary, who came from a hired-hand background, believed based on his many years of production experience that it was now necessary to pump the lake water up, and the little water remaining in the ponds and dams should be temporarily stored to be used for emergency relief when the drought was most severe. When he voiced this idea at a production team leader meeting, he thought he would get everyone's support. Who knew that as soon as he finished speaking, the second production team leader, Xiao Yi, opened his mouth:

"Secretary Zhu, there is still a little water in the ponds and dams. I don't think we need to bother with the great effort of pumping lake water. How can it not rain?"

Although the other team leaders didn't speak, it could be seen that they somewhat agreed with Xiao Yi's remarks. Even the production team leader, Li Changlin, was thinking to himself: "Fighting drought for early rice has already exhausted everyone. Now, instead of using the nearby water, we are going to pump water from afar. Won't it be a waste of effort if it rains later?"

Old Zhu has this characteristic: He never forces everyone to do things that they don't understand. However, he also has this kind of energy: As long as he believes something is right and beneficial to everyone, he will find a way to make it successful, no matter how difficult it is. He knew that the reason why everyone was not so enthusiastic about rescuing mid-season rice and single-crop late rice (especially mid-season rice) was not that they opposed it, but that they underestimated the severity of the drought, were complacent, and lacked the determination to fight drought for a long time. In order to help everyone recognize the severity of the drought and eliminate the idea of waiting for rain, he decided to find experienced old farmers who had fought drought and mobilize the masses through them. One day, he went to the seventh production team to find Gao Kunhua, Wang Chuanfu, and Wang Chenglie, several old farmers. Gao Kunhua was a well-known "local expert" in the team who was good at observing the weather. Based on his decades of experience, he could guess whether it would be windy and rainy eight or nine times out of ten. So, as soon as Old Zhu saw him, he asked:

"Will it rain in the next few days?"

Old Gao seemed to know what Old Zhu was thinking and replied, "Old Zhu, if we don't fight drought for mid-season rice, we will definitely lose it!"

Old Zhu's casual conversation with the old men aroused a series of past events. Take the year of Yihai, for example. The rain that year didn't stop until the sixth day of the sixth lunar month. The ponds were full and overflowing. But then it didn't rain for more than 20 days, and large tracts of green rice seedlings were simply dried to death. People fled in all directions, begging for food. The old men said, "As the saying goes, 'It is better to be first than last.' If we don't pump lake water to save mid-season rice now, we will definitely suffer a big loss in the future!"

The experience of the old men was very educational to the people. Wang Liangwan, the leader of the seventh production team, who was originally planning to wait for rain, immediately led the team members to set up four waterwheels at the Li family embankment near Taihu Port. In three days, they irrigated 40 to 50 mu of mid-season rice and filled eight ponds. However, the ninth production team, which was adjacent to this team, used up the water in sixteen of their seventeen ponds. As a result, more than 50 mu of mid-season rice were not irrigated. Old Zhu seized on this example and immediately convened an on-site meeting, proposing the questions of "long-term drought resistance or short-term drought resistance?" and "large-scale drought resistance or small-scale drought resistance?" for everyone to discuss and debate. As a result, the cadres and the masses of the whole team quickly abandoned the idea of waiting for rain, and a struggle to seize mid-season rice from the drought began.

There were many difficulties in pumping the lake water up. The lake water was low-lying and the distance was long. In particular, the team lacked labor and tools. Therefore, in those extraordinary days, in order to help each team mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties, Old Zhu ran around non-stop from morning to night. At noon one day in mid-July, Old Zhu had just finished inspecting the seventh, eighth, and ninth teams and went to the second team under the scorching sun. At this time, team leader Xiao Yi and the team members were setting up waterwheels by the lake. When Xiao Yi saw Old Zhu coming, he shouted from afar:

"Secretary Zhu, our mid-season rice is doomed!"

Old Zhu grunted in response and walked towards Xiao Yi. After asking, he learned that the ponds and dams of this team had dried up, and more than 120 mu of mid-season rice could only rely on seven waterwheels to pump lake water. They calculated that even if they pumped day and night, they could only irrigate six mu a day. It would take more than 20 days to irrigate all 120 mu of mid-season rice. Old Zhu was really flustered when he heard this. Because he knew that all the waterwheels that this team could use had been taken out, and all the people who could pump water had been mobilized. Old Zhu, who had never bowed his head in the face of difficulties, suddenly felt that the word "difficulty" was like a thousand-pound stone pressing on his heart, becoming heavier and heavier... He suddenly thought: Why not ask the masses for ideas? During the lunch break, he specially found Fu Quanming, nicknamed "Staff Officer," and Chu Zhenghua, Xie Chuanxian, and several other team members. Based on their suggestions, the water pumping route, which originally needed to pass through three ponds, was changed to dig a 500- to 600-meter-long canal. In this way, the seven waterwheels could be reduced to three. At the same time, the water output of one waterwheel was increased to three. As a result, 40 mu were irrigated in one day. All 120 mu of mid-season rice in the entire team were irrigated in only three or four days. This is the water pumping experience of "using ditches instead of waterwheels" that people have been praising. After that, Old Zhu also relied on the masses to adopt the method of "digging ditches through the fields" so that the water would no longer pass through large areas of dry land, but would flow directly and quickly into the rice fields that urgently needed rescue. Dear readers, at this moment when every drop of water is precious, no one has calculated how much water this has saved, and at the same time, how much grain has been increased due to the timely irrigation. However, people will always remember that Old Zhu, an ordinary Communist Party member and a Party worker, spent his thoughts and energy in this struggle against drought, which cannot be expressed in numbers!

In August, we came to the production team led by Old Zhu. Although the time was so short, the soaring energy shining on his body left us with an indelible impression. He is a person who never knows fatigue! The day after we arrived, in order to interview him, we looked for him in several teams and finally ran into him in the second team. Before we could say a few words, he disappeared. As a result, we found him again in the seventh team. On this day, he was wearing a straw hat and barefoot, studying the drought resistance problem with the team cadres under the scorching sun. Comrade Lao Zhou, who accompanied us on the visit, asked him with concern, "Old Zhu, have you eaten?" "No," Old Zhu replied casually. We looked at the clock, and the hour hand was already pointing to 3:30 p.m., and he hadn't eaten lunch yet! We suddenly remembered that when we first arrived, someone told us that it was commonplace for Old Zhu to forget to eat when he was busy, especially in July, when the mid-season rice was heading and filling, and the drought was even more serious. Old Zhu braved the scorching sun every day, barefoot and bare-backed, and went wherever there was a difficulty. He often didn't go home, take a bath, or change clothes for several days and nights. There is such a story: Once, he pumped water with the team members in the second team for two days. At night, the team members all went home to sleep, but he rushed to the eighth and ninth teams in the moonlight. When he arrived at the Li family arch village in the ninth team, he found that more than three mu of mid-season rice behind the village had dried up, and about three or four minutes of the field had already "exploded" and fallen down. At that time, the south wind was blowing so hard that the rice seedlings could not stand up straight. When he saw this situation, he thought to himself: If he didn't irrigate and rescue them, they would all be blown down overnight. So, he started walking towards the village, but then he thought that the team members had already worked for a day and were now sleeping soundly. How could he call them up? He turned back again and went to the edge of the field. The rice seedlings that had already headed were swaying left and right in the wind, as if asking Old Zhu for help. At this time, he thought: Can he watch the rice that is about to be eaten be lost? No, he can't! He immediately made up his mind, ran to the village, and woke up the team leader and a team member. In the dim moonlight, the three of them carried water from a distant pond to irrigate the field. Somehow, this matter was immediately known to the team members. In less than a bag of cigarettes' time, more than ten team members came. Everyone worked together and finally rescued the rice seedlings in this field.

Old Zhu is such a person. During the days of drought resistance, he worked day and night. Several times, he almost fainted on the waterwheel, but when he found that someone was not paying attention to rest, he often criticized others in a stern tone. For example, in order to allow the team members to work and rest well in the hot weather, the team had decided to start work early, finish work late, and must rest at noon. However, due to the team members' high enthusiasm for labor, they often "openly agreed but secretly opposed" the team's decision. Once, Old Zhu held a cadre meeting in the tenth team, and it was already 11 p.m. At this time, Zhang Jiayang Ridge in the eighth team was still filled with the sound of gongs and drums. He groped his way to the ridge and saw that team leader You Jinxiang and more than 20 team members were still pumping water. Old Zhu said unhappily:

"It's past 11 o'clock. Why are you still pumping water?"

Before the team leader could speak, team members Zhang Jicheng and Zhang Jisong took over and said, "Secretary Zhu, look, the rice is about to be dried to death. There are still two or three lines of water left. We'll rest after we finish pumping."

Old Zhu looked at the rice and it was indeed very dry, so he didn't say anything more. He walked to team leader You Jinxiang's waterwheel and replaced Zhang Jifa, a team member who was physically weaker. While pumping water, he said to You Jinxiang, "You must adhere to the system in the future! You must rest when the time comes!" Two days later, when the scorching sun was baking the earth, Old Zhu came to the eighth production team again and happened to see the team leader inspecting the fields. Old Zhu said in a reproachful tone, "Look at you, you should rest but you don't rest." In fact, Old Zhu is the one who takes the lead in not resting! Whenever the team members saw Old Zhu running around barefoot and bare-backed, they would say, "We don't rest because you take care of us, but you don't take care of yourself!" Whenever Old Zhu encountered this situation, he would just smile and say, "I've already gotten used to it. It doesn't matter!"

When we left here, more than 1,400 mu of mid-season rice in this team had turned yellow and ripened, and the team members were busy harvesting. At present, although the drought here is more serious and the water source is more difficult, under the leadership of Old Zhu, people's energy is like a burning flame, burning brighter and brighter. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice, the number of people participating in drought resistance in this team has increased from more than 300 to more than 600, and the number of waterwheels has increased from more than 60 to more than 100. Day and night, the sound of waterwheels can be heard everywhere in the fields. (Attached pictures)

    降伏旱魔的人
　　——记朱官成领导群众抗旱的模范事迹
　　本报记者　田庄　胡烈斌
    在这里，我们为读者介绍一位这样的人：从外表看，他几乎没有惊人的地方——矮小的身个，削瘦的脸盘，肤色黝黑而发亮。但是，就是他，一个充满着热情、浑身闪耀着干劲的人，领导群众降伏了旱魔，夺得了早稻、中稻的丰收。
    他的名字叫朱官成，是湖北省江陵县马山人民公社马南生产队的党支部书记。这些日子，老朱领导群众战胜干旱的英雄事迹，就像一阵风似地几乎吹遍了全公社、全县、全专区的每个角落。许多地方的干部和群众正在掀起“学朱官成、赶朱官成”的热潮，决心以他为榜样，做到旱一天抗一天，确保今年农业大增产。
    这是早稻抗旱丰收以后的事。
    7月天，烈日似火，干旱越来越严重了。刚刚领导群众从旱魔那里夺来早稻丰收的老朱，终日寻思着：早稻虽说丰收了，但是，中稻和一季晚稻面积大、产量高，俗话说得好，“老鼠拉木锨，大头还在后头哩！”
    当时，老朱把全队的塘堰排了下队，发现塘堰现存的水，顶多能灌两餐水，而根据中稻生长的需要，起码还得七餐水。这个长工出身的支部书记，凭他多年的生产经验，认为现在必需把湖水翻上来，塘堰里仅存的水暂时蓄起来，以便在干旱最严重时救急。当他把这主意在一次生产小队长会议上说出来时，他以为会得到大家的支持，谁知他的话音刚落，第二生产小队队长小易就开腔了：
    “朱书记，现在塘堰里多少还有点水，我看不必忙着花那大的劲翻湖水。哪有不落雨的天！”
    另外几个小队长虽说没有开口，但可以看出来，他们对小易这番话是有几分同意的。就连生产队长黎昌林心里也是这样嘀咕着：“早稻抗旱已经弄得人困马乏，现在放着近水不用，反而去车远水，将来落下雨，不是白费力气。”
    老朱有这样一个特点，大家思想不通的事，他从不勉强大家去做。但是，他也有这么股劲，只要在他看来是正确的而又有利于大家的事，哪怕天大的困难，他也总得设法把它做成功。他清楚：抢救中稻和一季晚稻（特别是中稻），并不是大家反对，而只是大家对旱情估计不足，思想麻痹，缺乏长期与干旱作斗争的决心。为了帮助大家认识旱情的严重性，消除等天下雨的思想，他决定找与干旱斗争有经验的老农，通过他们把群众发动起来。有一天，他到第七生产小队去找高昆华、王传富和王成烈几个老农。高昆华是队里有名的善观气象的“土专家”，他凭几十年的老经验，什么时候刮风下雨，能够猜上个八、九成。所以老朱一看见就问他：
    “这几天有雨吗？”
    老高头好像知道老朱的心思似的，回答道：“老朱呵，中稻再不抗旱非丢不可啦！”
    老朱跟老人们闲扯中，勾引起一连串的往事。就拿乙亥年说吧，这一年的雨哟，直下到六月六才住点，塘满堰流，但是后来连干了二十多天，还是把大片大片青乌乌的青禾，活活地旱死了。闹得人们东逃西散，讨饭度日。老人们说：“俗话说：‘先下手为强，后下手遭殃’，现在不翻湖水救中稻，将来准吃大亏啊！”
    老人们的这段经历给人们很大教育。原来准备等天下雨的第七生产小队队长王良万，立即带领社员在靠太湖港的李家垱，架了四部水车，三天工夫灌了四、五十亩中稻，还把八口塘灌得满满的。但是，与这个队相邻的第九生产小队，十七口塘就把十六口的水用得一干二净，结果还有五十多亩中稻没灌上水。老朱抓住这个典型，立即召开现场会，并提出“长期抗旱还是短期抗旱？”“大抗还是小抗？”让大家鸣放辩论。这一来，全队的干部和群众很快就丢掉了等天下雨思想，一场与干旱争夺中稻的斗争便开始了。
    把湖水翻上来是有许许多多困难的。湖水地势低，路程远，特别是这个队劳动力和工具都十分不足。因此，在那些不寻常的日子里，为了帮助各队发动群众克服困难，老朱每天从早到晚不住脚地跑来跑去。7月中旬的一天中午，老朱刚刚在七、八、九队检查完毕，又顶着太阳到了第二小队，这时队长小易和社员们在湖边上架水车，小易见老朱来了，老远就喊了起来：
    “朱书记，我们的中稻算是无法保住啦！”
    老朱顺口“嗯”了一声，就朝着小易走去，一问原来是这样的：这个小队的塘堰已经干涸了，一百二十多亩中稻，只有靠七部水车翻湖水。他们计算了一下，即使不分日夜地车，一天也顶多灌六亩，一百二十亩中稻全部灌上水，就得二十多天。老朱一听，心里着实慌了。因为他知道这个队能用的水车都拿出来了，能车水的人也都出动了。从来在困难面前不肯低头的老朱，这时突然感到“困难”这两个字，就像一块千斤重的石头压在心头，越来越重……。他猛地一想：为什么不到群众中想想办法呢？趁中午休息的时候，他特地找到了外号叫“参谋”的符全名和楚正华、谢传先几个社员，根据他们的意见，把原来需要经过三个塘堰的车水路线，改挖一条五、六百米长的渠道，这样就可以把七部水车减少到三部，同时，原来一部水车出水，现在增加到三部，这样一来，一天就灌了四十亩，全小队一百二十多亩中稻，只三、四天时间，全部都灌上了水。这就是被人们传颂的“以沟代车”的车水经验。这以后，老朱还依靠群众采用“穿田挖沟”的方法，使水不再经过一大块一大块的干渴的土地，直接而迅速地流进急需抢救的稻田里。亲爱的读者，在此刻滴水滴金的情况下，这样到底节约了多少水，同时，由于及时地灌上水而能增加多少粮食，没有人算过这笔账，但是，人们永远记得，老朱，一个普通的共产党员，一个党的工作者，在这场同干旱的斗争中，他花费的心思和精力却是不能用数字表达的呀！
    8月，我们来到了老朱领导的生产队。尽管时间那么短暂，但他浑身闪烁着的冲天干劲却给我们留下了难以磨灭的印象。他是个永不知疲倦的人啊！我们到的第二天，为了访问他，我们曾找了好几个小队，最后在第二小队碰上了他。没说上几句话，一下他不见了。结果在第七小队又找到了他。这天，他戴着草帽，赤着脚，在火热的太阳下正跟小队干部研究抗旱问题。陪同我们访问的老周同志关心地问他：“老朱，吃过饭了吗？”“没有。”老朱漫不经意地回答着。我们看了看表，这时时针已指向三点半钟了，他还未吃中午饭哩！我们突然想起刚到的时候，就有人告诉我们，老朱忙起来忘记吃饭已是家常事了，特别是7月间，中稻正在抽穗灌浆，而干旱也更加严重了。老朱每天顶着炙人的太阳，赤背光脚，哪里有困难就到哪里，常常几天几夜不进家、不洗澡、不换衣服。有这样一个故事：有一次，他在第二小队跟社员一道车了两天水，到了夜晚，社员们都回家睡觉去了，他却披着月色赶到八、九队，到了九队李家牌坊村，他发现村后有一块三亩多中稻干涸了，其中大约有三、四分田已经“炸茎”倒下来了。当时，南风呼呼地吹得稻禾直不起腰来。他看到这种情况，心里寻思着：如果不灌水抢救，一夜工夫准会全部吹倒。于是，他拔腿就朝村里走去，但又想，社员们已经干了一天，现在正睡得香甜，怎能叫他们起来呢？折身又转了回来，去到田边，已经抽了穗的稻禾，随风左右摇摆，好像求救于老朱似的，这时他想：能眼看着快吃到嘴边上的稻米丢掉吗？不能，不能！他立即下了决心，跑到村里叫醒了小队长和一个社员，在蒙蒙月色中，三个人从老远的一口塘里提水灌田，不知怎的，这件事一下被社员们知道了，没有一袋烟的工夫，又来了十多个社员，大家七手八脚地终于把这块田的稻禾救下了。
    老朱就是这样的人，在抗旱的日子里，他是没日没夜地工作着，有几次差点昏倒在车水架上，但是，当发现有人不注意休息的时候，他却常常以严厉的口吻批评别人。例如，队里为了让社员在大热天劳动好、休息好，曾经决定早上工，晚收工，中午一定要休息，但是，由于社员劳动热情高，常常对队里的决定“阳奉阴违”。有一次，老朱在十队开罢干部会，已经是深夜十一点了，这时八小队的张家杨岭还是锣鼓喧天，他摸着黑赶到那里一看，原来是小队长尤金相和二十多个社员还在车水，老朱老大不高兴地说：
    “十一点多了，怎么还在车水？”
    小队长还未开口，社员张继成和张继松就接过去说：“朱书记，你看谷子快给干死了，现在还差两、三线水，车完了就休息。”
    老朱看看稻禾也确是干枯得厉害，再没说什么，就走到小队长尤金相的那架水车跟前，把身体较弱的社员张继发换了下来，一面车水一面对尤金相说：“以后可要坚持制度呀！到时间一定休息！”过了两天，当顶的太阳晒得大地直冒气，老朱又来到了第八生产小队，碰巧小队长正在田里检查田缺，老朱带着责备的口吻说：“看你，该休息又不休息。”其实，老朱就是个带头不休息的人呵！社员们每每看到老朱赤背光脚到处跑的时候，都是这样说：“我们不休息有你照顾，可是你太不照顾自己了！”老朱每逢遇到这种场合，只嘿嘿地一笑，说：“我这已经成了习惯了，没有关系！”
    我们离开这里时，这个队一千四百多亩中稻已经黄熟了，社员们正忙着抢收。目前，虽然这里的干旱更加严重了，水源更加困难了，但是，在老朱的领导下，人们的干劲却像燃烧起来的火焰一样，越烧越旺。为了争取晚稻的丰收，现在，这个队参加抗旱的人数已由原来的三百多人增加到六百多人，水车由六十多部增加到一百多部，日日夜夜，田野里到处响着车水的哗哗声。（附图片）
