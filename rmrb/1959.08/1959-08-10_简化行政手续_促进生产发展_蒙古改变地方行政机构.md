Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 8th: The Presidium of the Mongolian Great People's Hural issued an order regarding changes in local administrative organs, stating that with the exception of Ulaanbaatar City, all provinces in Mongolia will abolish the two-level administrative organs of Bag (township) and Horin (sub-district). The decision was made to designate the local administrative units as Sum (county) and Horon (district).

Currently, excluding Ulaanbaatar City, a total of 404 Sums and 27 Horons have been established in the seventeen provinces and one city (Sukhbaatar City) nationwide.

The order pointed out that due to the fact that all individual herders in Mongolia have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, socialist relations of production have been victorious. At the same time, according to the wishes of the broad masses of working people and the results of experiments, it is necessary to make appropriate changes to local administrative organs.

As previously reported, at the beginning of this year, with the development of the agricultural and pastoral collectivization movement, some provinces in the Mongolian People's Republic implemented the integration of Sum (county) and cooperatives. According to the decision of the People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers, the primary-level organs of state power at the Bag (township) level were abolished. The results of the implementation showed that this change can simplify administrative procedures, streamline institutions, and save expenses, as well as promote production development and strengthen leadership.

    简化行政手续　促进生产发展
    蒙古改变地方行政机构
    新华社乌兰巴托8日电　蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团发布关于改变地方行政机构的命令说，蒙古除乌兰巴托市外，各省一律撤销巴戈（乡）和霍林（分区）这两级行政机构，决定地方行政单位为苏木（县）和霍伦（区）。
    现在，除乌兰巴托市外，在全国十七省和一个市（苏赫巴托尔市）共建立四百零四个苏木和二十七个霍伦。
    命令指出，由于蒙古的个体牧民全部加入了农牧业合作社，社会主义生产关系已获得了胜利，同时，根据广大劳动人民的愿望以及试验的结果，有必要对地方行政机构作适当的改变。
    前已报道，在今年年初，随着农牧业合作化运动的发展，蒙古人民共和国有一些省实行了苏木（县）和合作社合一，它们根据人民革命党和部长会议的决定，撤销了巴戈（乡）一级的基层政权机构。实行结果表明，这种改变能够简化行政手续，精简机构和节省开支，并且促进了生产的发展和领导的加强。
