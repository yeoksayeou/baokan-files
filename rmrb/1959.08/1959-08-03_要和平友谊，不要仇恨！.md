    Want Peace and Friendship, Not Hatred!
    By Our Correspondent Xi Linsheng
    On the opening day of the festival, magnificent marches were broadcast over loudspeakers, and 15,000 young people from more than a hundred countries, wearing various national costumes, sang and danced into the Vienna Stadium. They and the tens of thousands of waiting spectators merged into a sea of ​​joy. Suddenly, a small plane appeared in the southeast corner, buzzing like a mosquito, with reactionary slogans written on the white streamer trailing behind it. After a while, it sneaked away again. It seems that the world's youth gathering together for peace and friendship deeply frightens a small group of people, who always want to sow seeds of hatred among people. However, the situation in the past few days has proved that the central idea of the festival—peace and friendship—has taken root in people's hearts. Young people from all countries have shown with practical actions that they want peace and friendship, not hatred.
                Touching Scene
    As soon as the performance of the Vietnamese Youth Art Troupe ended, the actors repeatedly took bows amid warm applause from the audience. At this moment, a young representative from Madagascar stepped onto the stage. After presenting gifts to the Vietnamese artists, he said: "We sincerely congratulate the youth of Vietnam on gaining freedom and independence. But today, war is still going on in Algeria, and the youth of Algeria are still in distress. We hope that the youth of Algeria will soon gain freedom and independence." As soon as this young man from Madagascar finished speaking, a young French representative also jumped onto the stage. He said in a powerful voice: "Although our government is waging the Algerian war, we, the young men and women of France, do not want war. What we want is peace and friendship. We hope that peace can be achieved in Algeria soon." A burst of thunderous applause erupted from the audience to welcome his speech, and then young people from France, Vietnam, and French Africa embraced each other tightly. This moment made it clear to people that some people drive young people to the battlefield for selfish purposes, while peace and friendship make people love and unite like brothers.
                Exposing Conspirators
    We still remember that when the train carrying the Chinese and Korean youth delegations to the festival slowly entered the Vienna station, the welcoming crowd rushed to give flowers to the young friends from the Far East. But one person was sneaking around in the crowd like a thief, constantly taking out a piece of paper and stuffing it into people's pockets. People opened it and saw that it was a leaflet printed in the name of the American delegation, slandering the festival and the Chinese and Korean delegations in English, German, Russian, and Chinese. People angrily handed him over to the police. A US passport and a British citizenship certificate were found on him.
    The next day, the young American delegates who had arrived in Vienna earlier to participate in the festival issued a statement through the International Committee. The statement said that we, the young American delegates who arrived in Vienna earlier to participate in the festival, went to the station with Austrian youth yesterday (July 22) to welcome the Chinese and Korean delegations. There, we felt the spirit of the festival for the first time, the vigor of the young people, and their firm belief in gathering together and striving for friendship and mutual understanding. But at the same place, someone published a defamatory leaflet in the name of the American delegation. We can't help but ask: "Who, which organization instructed you to do such a despicable act?" The statement also said that we solemnly declare that any conspiracy to undermine the festival has nothing to do with us.
                Eliminating All Barriers
    At an evening party, the spacious hall was crowded with young people from various countries. There were Asians, Africans, and Europeans. They spoke the languages ​​of various countries, wore the costumes of various countries, and danced various dances. They also had different ideas and beliefs. But all this did not hinder their friendly contact with each other. They had a common desire to work together for peace and friendship.
    But this is not the case for everyone, everywhere in the world. In some places, people are persecuted and massacred simply because of the color of their skin. But their means of creating hatred are becoming less and less effective. Under the radiance of peace and friendship, the despicable attempts of these people will not succeed.
    During the festival, a reporter from a certain American newspaper suddenly sneaked into the busy office hall of the International Committee. He walked up to a young African man as if he was secretly looking for something and whispered: "Do you know what 'freedom' means here?" The African youth replied: "Of course I know, if there were no freedom, you wouldn't be able to come in." The American reporter said again: "You should know that this festival is communist in nature." The African youth replied:
  "I don't understand what you are saying, please explain it to me. I feel that even those who come from communist countries are good people." After that, the American reporter had to walk away dejectedly.
    Now please listen to a conversation between a young Kenyan man and Huang Baomei, a Chinese female representative, at a meeting between Chinese and African youth. He said: "After participating in the festival, I understand that the so-called barriers between white people, yellow people, and black people are all created by imperialism. We are all brothers. We must unite closely."
      Slander and Lies Cannot Break Friendship
    At a meeting between Iraqi and Chinese youth, a young Iraqi man enthusiastically grabbed a Chinese youth and said: "You know that the imperialists are doing everything possible to slander China and want to keep us away from you. But we will not forget that when the imperialists invaded us, China stood on the side of justice. We are with you." Indeed, the deep friendship with China expressed by this Iraqi friend can be seen everywhere during the festival.
    In Vienna, the friendly feelings of young people from various countries towards Chinese youth are difficult to describe in words. People often encounter many enthusiastic young people who take the initiative to express their respect to Chinese youth. Chinese youth representatives can also often hear these words: "Although we are far away from you, I understand China, the Chinese people are very good people, and China is a very good country. We love China. This feeling cannot be destroyed by any force."

    要和平友谊，不要仇恨！
    本报记者　席林生
    联欢节开幕的那天，扩音器播送着雄壮的进行曲，一百多个国家的一万五千名青年穿着各种各样的民族服装，歌唱着欢舞着走进了维也纳大运场动。他们和等候着的数万观众汇集成一个欢腾的海洋。突然，东南角上出现了一架小飞机，它像蚊子般地嗡嗡叫着，尾巴上拖着的白色带子上写着反动的标语。不一会它又偷偷地溜走了。看来，世界的青年们为了和平和友谊聚合一起，是使一小撮人深为害怕的，他们总想在人们中间撒下仇恨的种子。但是，这几天来的情况证明，联欢节的中心思想——和平和友谊，已经深入人心。各国青年们用实际行动表明，他们是要和平要友谊而不要仇恨的。
                动人的一幕
    越南青年艺术团的表演刚结束，演员们在观众热烈掌声中一再谢幕。这时一位马达加斯加的青年代表走上了舞台，他向越南艺术家们献礼后说：“我们衷心祝贺越南的青年获得了自由独立。但是今天在阿尔及利亚还进行战争，阿尔及利亚的青年还在困苦之中，我们希望阿尔及利亚的青年不久也能得到自由和独立”。这位马达加斯加的青年刚一说完，一位法国青年代表也跳上了舞台，他用有力的声调说：“虽然我们的政府在进行阿尔及利亚战争，但是我们法国青年男女是不要战争的，我们要的是和平和友谊。我们希望不久在阿尔及利亚能够实现和平。”台下迸发出一阵春雷般的掌声欢迎他的讲话，接着法国、越南和法属非洲的青年们紧紧地拥抱在一起。这霎那使人们清楚看到，有人为了自私的目的把青年驱向战场，而和平和友谊使人们像兄弟一样地友爱团结起来。
                揭穿阴谋者
    我们还记得，当列车载着中国和朝鲜参加联欢节的青年代表团徐徐驶进维也纳的车站的时候，欢迎的人群争着把鲜花送给来自遥远东方的青年朋友们。但是有一个人却像小偷似的在人堆里钻来钻去，不时地掏出一张纸塞进人们的衣袋里。人们打开一看，原来是印着一张以美国代表团为名的，用英、德、俄、中四国文字写的诬蔑联欢节，诬蔑中朝代表团的传单。人们愤怒地把他交给了警察。从他的身上搜出了一张美国护照和英国公民证。
    第二天，美国先行到达维也纳的参加联欢节的青年代表通过国际委员会发表了一项声明。声明说，我们先行到达维也纳参加联欢节的美国青年代表们，昨天（7月22日）和奥地利青年一起到车站去迎接中国和朝鲜的代表团。在那里我们第一次感受到联欢节的精神，青年们的朝气以及他们聚集在一起，为友谊和互相了解而努力的坚定信念。但同时在同一地方，有人用美国代表团名义发表诬蔑性传单。我们不禁要问：“是谁，那一个组织指使你们做出这样卑鄙的勾当？”声明又说，我们郑重声明，任何一切企图损害联欢节的阴谋活动都与我们无关。
                消除一切隔阂
    在一个晚会上，宽敞的大厅挤满了各国的年青人，这里有亚洲人、非洲人、欧洲人。他们说着各个国家的语言，穿着各个国家的服装，跳着各种各样的舞。他们也有着不同的思想和信仰。但是这一切都没有阻碍他们彼此之间友好的接触，他们有着为和平和友谊而共同努力的心念。
    但是并不是在世界上每个人，每个地方都是这样的。有的地方，也就因为人的皮肤颜色不同而遭受到迫害和屠杀。但是他们这种制造仇恨的手段已经越来越不灵了。在和平和友谊的光辉照耀下，这些人的卑鄙企图是不会成功的。
    就在联欢节期间，在国际委员会繁忙的办公大厅里，突然钻进来一个某家美国报纸的记者。他鬼鬼祟祟地寻找着什么东西一样走到一位非洲青年面前，低声说：“你们这里知道什么叫‘自由’吗？”非洲青年回答说：“当然知道，如果没有自由，你也就进不来了。”这个美国记者又说：“你要知道这联欢节是共产主义性质的。”非洲青年回答说：
  “我不理解你的话，请你解释一下。我感到即使共产主义国家来的也都是一些好人。”在这之后，这位美国记者只得灰溜溜地走了。
    再请听一听一位怯尼亚青年在一次中国青年和非洲青年会见会上，和中国女代表黄宝妹的一次谈话吧。他说：“在参加了联欢节之后，我明白：所谓白种人、黄种人和黑种人之间的隔阂，都是帝国主义造出来的。我们都是兄弟。我们要紧紧团结在一起。”
      诬蔑和谎言割不断友情
    在一次伊拉克和中国青年的会见会上，一位伊拉克青年热情地拉着中国青年说：“你们知道帝国主义正在尽一切可能诬蔑中国，想使我们远离你们。但是我们不会忘记，当帝国主义侵略我们时，中国是站在正义一边的。我们是和你们一起的。”的确，像这位伊拉克朋友所表现的对中国的深厚友情，在联欢节期间是到处都可以看到的。
    在维也纳，各国青年对中国青年的友好的感情是很难用言语来形容的。人们经常会碰到许多热情的青年，主动地跑来向中国青年表示敬意。中国青年代表也经常可以听见这样的话：“虽然我们和你们相隔很远，但是我懂得中国，中国的人民是很好的人民，中国是一个很好的国家。我们热爱中国。这种感情是任何力量所不能摧毁的。”
