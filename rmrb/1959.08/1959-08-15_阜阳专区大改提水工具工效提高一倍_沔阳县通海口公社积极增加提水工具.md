Fuyang Prefecture Radically Improves Water Lifting Tools, Doubling Efficiency

Mianyang County's Tonghaikou Commune Actively Increases Water Lifting Tools

Hefei, August 14th (By this newspaper) - The Party committees at all levels in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, mobilized the masses to reform water lifting tools in the drought resistance campaign, greatly improving the efficiency of drought resistance and seedling protection throughout the region. Since the drought began in early June, 16 million mu of autumn crops in the prefecture have been affected. Thanks to the reform of various old-style water lifting tools and the rush production of nearly 100,000 sets of various advanced water lifting tools, efficiency has been greatly improved. The daily progress of drought resistance and irrigation in the entire prefecture has reached more than 800,000 mu, more than double the daily progress of drought resistance and irrigation in the early stage of drought resistance. At the same time, 500,000 laborers have been saved and put into field management of autumn crops.

Since last year, Fuyang Prefecture has been carrying out extensive tool reforms, which have played a significant role in production. The reform of water lifting tools is even more remarkable. However, with the continuous development of the drought this year, the water level has generally dropped, and the quantity and quality of the original water lifting tools cannot meet the needs of drought resistance and irrigation. After discovering this problem, the Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately mobilized the masses throughout the prefecture to use their experience from last year to rapidly and massively reform and rush produce advanced water lifting tools. The entire region mobilized more than 15,000 iron and wood workers from all sides to go all out and concentrate on reforming water lifting tools. In solving the material problem, on the one hand, old materials were used to renovate new ones, saving raw materials, and on the other hand, members' waste wood materials were vigorously purchased and waste wood materials from various communes and production teams were cleaned up. After mobilizing the masses in various places, high-efficiency and advanced water lifting tools continued to emerge. Such as push-pull waterwheels reformed using the principle of weaving machines, waterwheels with foot pedals and two large flailing wheels, large wheel waterwheels, wind-powered waterwheels, etc.; these reformed waterwheels are all equipped with ball bearings, and the efficiency is more than doubled compared to the original waterwheels. The Luzhuang Brigade of the Guangwu Commune in Jieshou County originally had 98 dragon bone waterwheels, occupying more than 580 laborers, and could only irrigate more than 370 mu of rice paddies a day, averaging less than four mu per unit. After the reform, only 25 wind-powered waterwheels and 30 laborers were needed to irrigate more than 370 mu of rice paddies, saving more than 500 laborers. Last year, Niqiu Commune in Taihe County planted more than 20,000 mu of rice, and 73% of the labor force was occupied in July and August, and it was still difficult to maintain the seedlings. This year, the drought situation is more serious than in the same period last year, and the planted rice area has been expanded to more than 50,000 mu, but because the water lifting tools have been reformed, only 30% of the labor force has been used to protect these rice paddies. Because of the reform of water lifting tools, the drought resistance efficiency of the entire region has generally increased by more than one time compared to the initial stage of drought resistance.

In order to ensure the rapid reform of water lifting tools, the Fuyang Party committees at all levels convened a tool reform conference in early July, and selected and finalized the types of water lifting tools through on-site appraisal and identification. During the manufacturing process, various places also organized iron and wood workers to divide the work according to their specialties, and established a strict acceptance system.

Wuhan, August 15th (By this newspaper) - The Tonghaikou Commune in Mianyang County, Hubei, relying on the masses, adopted a three-pronged approach of repairing, renting, and reforming to vigorously grasp water lifting tools, increasing drought resistance capacity by three times. Now the drought-affected fields in the entire commune can be irrigated every three days, while saving a large amount of labor for other work.

The Tonghaikou Commune originally had 1,600 human-powered waterwheels, 130 wind-powered waterwheels, and 90 animal-powered waterwheels. Before the drought occurred, these tools were only 70 percent ready to use as 30% were not properly repaired and maintained, and the 70% of tools deployed could only irrigate 8,000 mu of land per day. At that time, 85,000 mu of land had already been affected by the drought. If tools were not increased, it would take ten days to irrigate the fields once, which was far from meeting the needs of drought resistance, and the drought was expanding day by day. Under duress, the commune increased the drought resistance labor force from 12,000 to 23,600 (of which about 10,000 were carrying water for drought resistance). The labor force increased by nearly one time, but the drought resistance capacity only increased by slightly more than one-third, from irrigating 8,000 mu per day to 11,000 mu, which still did not solve the big problem.

In response to the above situation, the commune party committee convened an expanded meeting, persuading some people to abandon the idea of simply asking for more tools. The correct attitude should be to rely on the masses and take strong measures of repairing, renting, and reforming to solve the problem of drought resistance tools. The commune party committee mobilized and organized 360 iron and wood workers and 400 carpenters to rush repair 1,866 waterwheels. At the same time, it used cash to purchase (recording debts in the absence of cash, paying after the early rice harvest) more than 2,000 parts and components of water lifting tools from members, and matched these parts and components into 462 waterwheels. In addition, the method of contracting repairs and painting, and determining the amount of rent according to the variety and quality, was widely promoted, mobilizing the masses to rent out their water lifting tools, either taking rent or recording work points. Members of the entire commune rented out a total of 873 waterwheels. By adopting these methods, the number of waterwheels in the entire commune increased from the original 1,600 to 3,210. In addition to renting out waterwheels and selling waterwheel parts, the masses also invested 15,600 yuan, sold 6,032 various materials, and 34,460 other sundries. These things provided material conditions for repairing and reforming tools.

In addition, Ren Tiandong, the secretary of the Youth League branch of the Chengguan Management Area, and carpenter Wang Jianhua, transformed the single-groove ox-drawn waterwheel into a double-groove ox-drawn waterwheel, which could irrigate 28 mu of land a day, increasing efficiency by one time. The commune party committee seized this typical example and vigorously promoted tool reform. After four days of reform and addition, the number of foot-powered waterwheels in the entire commune increased from 90 to 398, saving more than 3,000 laborers, and the number of wind-powered waterwheels increased from 130 to 191, saving 2,200 laborers.

Through the above measures, the drought resistance capacity of the entire commune was increased from irrigating 11,000 mu of land per day to 35,000 mu, and the existing drought-affected fields could be irrigated once every three days, ensuring the needs of drought resistance. Because increasing waterwheels reduced the labor force for carrying water, and vigorously reforming tools reduced the labor force for operating waterwheels, the daily labor force participating in drought resistance in the entire commune was reduced from 23,600 to 17,300, saving 6,300 people for other agricultural work.

　　阜阳专区大改提水工具工效提高一倍
　　沔阳县通海口公社积极增加提水工具
    本报合肥14日电　安徽省阜阳专区各级党委在抗旱运动中，发动群众改革提水工具，大大提高了全区抗旱保苗的工效。这个专区从6月初发生旱情以来有一千六百万亩秋季作物受旱。由于各种旧式提水工具进行了改革，赶制了近十万部各式先进提水工具，工效大大提高，全专区抗旱浇地的日进度达八十多万亩，比抗旱初期的抗旱浇地日进度增加一倍以上，同时节省了五十万劳力，投入秋季作物的田间管理工作。
    去年以来阜阳专区大搞工具改革，在生产中曾发挥很大作用。提水工具的改革更为显著。但是今年随着旱情的不断发展，水位普遍下降，原有提水工具的数量与质量，不能满足抗旱浇地的需要。中共阜阳地委发现这一问题后，立即在全专区大力发动群众运用去年经验，迅速大量地改革和赶制先进提水工具。全区共动员各方面的铁木工人一万五千多人，全力以赴，集中改革提水工具。在解决材料问题上，一方面以旧改新，节约原材料，一方面大力收购社员的废木料和清理各公社、生产队的废木料。各地经过发动群众，高效率先进提水工具不断出现。如用织布机原理改制成的推拉式水车，脚踏水车又加两个大掼轮的水车，大轮式水车，风力水车等等；这些改革的水车中都装上了滚珠轴承，工效都比原来的水车提高一倍以上。界首县光武公社芦庄大队原有龙骨水车九十八部，占用劳力五百八十多人，一天只能浇灌水稻三百七十多亩，平均每部不到四亩，经过改革以后，只用二十五部风力水车，三十个劳力，即能浇灌三百七十多亩水稻，节约了五百多劳力。太和县倪丘公社去年种水稻二万多亩，7、8月间占用了73％的劳力，提水保苗还感吃力。今年旱情比去年同期严重，所种水稻又扩大到五万多亩，但因改革了提水工具，只用了30％的劳力便把这些水稻保住了。因为改革提水工具，全专区抗旱工效比抗旱初期普遍提高一倍以上。
    阜阳各级党委为了保证提水工具的迅速改制，在7月初即召开工具改革会议，通过现场评比鉴定，对提水工具进行了选样定型，在制造过程中，各地还组织铁、木工人按特长分工，并建立了严格的验收制度。（阜阳通讯组）
    本报讯　湖北沔阳县通海口公社依靠群众，采用修配、租借、改革三管齐下的办法，大抓提水工具，使抗旱能力提高三倍。现在全社受旱的田每三天能灌一道水，同时节约大批劳动力投入其他工作。
    通海口公社原有人力水车一千六百部，风力水车一百三十部，畜力水车九十部。旱情发生以前，由于对提水工具抓得不够，这些工具有30％没有修整，投入抗旱的70％的工具每天只能灌田八千亩。当时受旱田已经有八万五千亩，如果不增加工具，每十天才能灌一道水，远远赶不上抗旱的需要，而旱情又一天天的扩大。公社在不得已的情况下，将抗旱劳动力由一万二千人增加到二万三千六百人（其中约有一万人挑水抗旱），劳动力增加了近一倍，但抗旱能力只提高三分之一强，由每天灌田八千亩增到一万一千亩，仍然不解决大问题。
    针对以上情况，公社党委召开了扩大会议，说服了某些人伸手要工具的思想，正确的态度应该是依靠群众，采取修配、租借、改革三管齐下的有力措施，解决抗旱工具问题。公社党委动员和组织了三百六十个铁木工人、四百个木匠，抢修了一千八百六十六部水车。同时用现金收购（缺现金的记账，早稻收割后付款）社员的提水工具的部件、零件二千多件，把这些部件、零件配套成四百六十二部水车。此外还普遍推行包修理包油漆，根据品种的不同、质量的好坏，决定租金多少的办法，动员群众把自己的提水工具出租，或拿租金，或记工分。全社社员共租出水车八百七十三部。采用这些办法，全公社的水车由原来的一千六百部增加到三千二百一十部。群众除了出租水车和卖水车零件以外，还投资一万五千六百元，卖出各种材料六千零三十二件，其他杂件三万四千四百六十件。这些东西为修理工具和改革工具提供了物质条件。
    此外，城关管理区团总支书记任天栋和木工王建华把单槽牛拉水车改成双槽牛拉水车，一天能灌水二十八亩，提高工效一倍。公社党委抓住这个典型，大力推行工具改革。全公社经过四天时间的改革和添造，脚力水车由九十部发展到三百九十八部，节省劳力三千多人，风力水车由一百三十部增加到一百九十一部，节省劳力二千二百人。
    通过以上措施，全公社的抗旱能力便由每天灌水一万一千亩提高到三万五千亩，每三天就可以把现有的受旱田普遍灌一道水，保证了抗旱的需要。由于增加水车减少了挑水的劳动力，大搞工具改革减少了车水的劳动力，全公社每天参加抗旱的劳动力便由二万三千六百人减到一万七千三百人，节约六千三百人投入其他农活。（沈笔英）
