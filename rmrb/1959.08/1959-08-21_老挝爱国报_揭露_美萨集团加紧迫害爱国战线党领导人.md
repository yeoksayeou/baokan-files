Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 19th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report today, the latest issue of the "Laos Patriotic Newspaper" published an editorial exposing the heinous acts of U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys in plotting to create public opinion and intensify the persecution of Lao Patriotic Front leaders.

The editorial pointed out that the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" recently gathered some hooligans in Vientiane, forced some soldiers, police officers, staff members, and a section of the masses to hold so-called rallies and parades, clamoring to slander the Lao Patriotic Front as "traitors" and slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as "invading Laos," demanding the establishment of a "special court" to try Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front who were illegally arrested by the Sananikone government under the instigation of U.S. imperialism. The editorial pointed out that the above shameful farce is a new step in the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys to expand the civil war and intensify the suppression of the Lao Patriotic Front under the guise of "anti-communism."

    “老挝爱国报”揭露
    美萨集团加紧迫害爱国战线党领导人
    据新华社河内19日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，最近一期的“老挝爱国报”发表社论，揭发美帝国主义及其老挝的走狗阴谋制造舆论，加紧迫害老挝爱国战线党领导人的罪恶行为。
    社论指出，所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们，最近在万象纠集一些流氓分子，强迫一些士兵、警察、职员和一部分群众举行所谓集会和游行，大叫大嚷地诬蔑老挝爱国战线党“叛国”，诬蔑越南民主共和国“侵略老挝”，要求设立“特别法庭”来审判被萨纳尼空政府在美帝国主义的唆使下非法逮捕的苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人。社论指出，上述可耻的丑剧，是美帝国主义及其老挝的走狗，在“反共”的幌子下，扩大内战，加紧镇压老挝爱国战线党的阴谋的新步骤。
