Turpan Grapes Bear Abundant Fruit

The famous Flaming Mountain Turpan Basin is currently the time when grapes are ripe, and watermelons and cantaloupes are on the market. Vineyards and melon fields are laden with fruit, and everywhere is a scene of bumper harvest. Uyghur and Hui commune members are making various preparations for drying raisins and melon strips. Fresh seedless grapes, mare nipple grapes, as well as sandy-sweet watermelons and thin-skinned, thick-fleshed cantaloupes are transported to Urumqi and nearby industrial and mining areas in large quantities every day.

The area under cultivation of melons and fruits in the Turpan Basin has more than doubled compared to 1949. The existing fruit trees, such as grapes, peaches, apricots, and pears, total more than 50,000 mu. Calculated based on the population of Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun counties, the average person owns 0.3 mu of orchard. Last year, the total output of various fruits and melons averaged more than 550 jin per person.

The grapes of Turpan Basin have long been famous throughout the country. Before liberation, the cultivated area was small, development was slow, and the yield was low. Now the grape area has increased by more than 17% compared with the time of liberation. The annual output of the famous seedless white raisins has reached 16 million jin, supplying people at home and abroad. Farmers in Grape Valley, Tuyu Valley, Tao'er Valley and Shahezi and other places on both sides of the Flaming Mountain, which are rich in grapes, have generally improved grape cultivation techniques this year. Uyghur and Hui commune members in the Grape Valley Management Area of the Grape People's Commune in Turpan County applied an average of 500 jin of base fertilizer to each of the more than 28,000 grape plants, nearly doubling the amount compared to last year, and applied top dressing three times, adding nitrogen-fixing bacteria and ammonium sulfate. At the same time, they leveled the land between the rows, and carried out pruning, pinching, and topping in a timely manner. According to the current fruit set of the grapes, it is estimated that each mu can produce about 1,000 jin of grapes, an increase of about 30% compared with last year.

Shanshan County, located on the east side of the basin, is a famous cantaloupe production area in Xinjiang. Hami melons are crisp, sweet, and fragrant. Among them, Donghu melons have a sugar content as high as 13% and can be made into sweet and dense melon strips. Currently, Donghu melons are beginning to ripen, and the melon fields are filled with a fragrant aroma. Commune members are busily preparing tools for drying melon strips. This year, the Dongfeng People's Commune signed a contract with the local commercial department to supply 50,000 kilograms of melon strips to various places.

### 吐鲁番葡萄结实累累

　　吐鲁番葡萄结实累累
    著名的火洲吐鲁番盆地，目前正是葡萄成熟，西瓜和哈密瓜上市的时候。葡萄园和瓜田里结实累累，到处一片丰收景象。维吾尔、回族社员正为晾制葡萄干和瓜干作各项准备工作。新鲜无核的葡萄、马奶子葡萄，以及沙瓤的大西瓜和皮薄肉厚的哈密瓜，每天都大批运往乌鲁木齐和附近工矿区。
    吐鲁番盆地的瓜果栽培面积比1949年增加一倍以上，现有的葡萄、桃、杏、梨等果树共五万多亩，按吐鲁番、鄯善和托克逊三县的人口计算，平均每人占有果园零点三亩。去年各种果品和瓜类的总产量，每人平均有五百五十斤以上。
    吐鲁番盆地的葡萄，早已著名全国。解放前栽培面积小，发展慢，产量低。现在葡萄面积比解放时增加了17％以上，著名无核白葡萄干，年产量达到一千六百万斤，供应国内外人民。在火焰山两侧盛产葡萄的葡萄沟、吐峪沟、桃儿沟和沙河子等地农民，今年普遍改进了葡萄栽培技术。吐鲁番县葡萄人民公社葡萄沟管理区的维吾尔、回族社员，今年给二万八千多墩结果葡萄平均每墩施基肥五百斤，比去年增加近一倍，追肥三次，追加了固氮菌和硫酸铵等，同时平整了行间土地，适时进行剪枝、打尖和摘心等工作。根据目前葡萄的结实情况，估计每亩可产葡萄一千斤左右，比去年增产30％左右。
    位于盆地东侧的鄯善县是新疆著名的哈密瓜产地。哈密瓜脆甜、香味浓，其中东湖瓜含糖量高达13％，可以制成甜腻如密的瓜干。目前东湖瓜开始成熟，瓜田里阵阵芳香扑鼻，社员们正忙碌地准备着晒制瓜干的工具。今年东风人民公社和当地商业部门签订了合同，计划以五万公斤瓜干供应各地。
