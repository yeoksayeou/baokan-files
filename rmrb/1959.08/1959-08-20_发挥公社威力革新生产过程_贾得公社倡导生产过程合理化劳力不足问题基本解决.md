　　Give Full Play to the Power of the Commune to Innovate the Production Process
　　Jiade Commune Advocates Rationalization of the Production Process, Basically Solving the Problem of Labor Shortage
    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, August 19th) The Jiade People's Commune in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, is giving full play to the superiority of the people's commune and carrying out a rationalization movement of the production process. By the end of the year, it can save 310,000 man-days and 170,000 animal-days. The Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held an on-site meeting here to promote this experience.
    The Jiade People's Commune has flat land and is rich in grain and cotton. According to the needs of the state plan, the cotton fields have been expanded year by year, and the amount of labor used has increased year by year; in addition, a part of the labor force has been transferred to support industrial construction, making the labor shortage even more apparent. According to the plan, the total labor required for the whole year this year is 3.99 million man-days, but the commune members only reported 3.38 million man-days, a difference of 610,000 man-days. At the end of March, the commune party committee held an enlarged party committee meeting with the participation of the general branch secretaries of the management areas to specifically discuss this issue. Two ideas were clearly expressed at the meeting: some people advocated compressing the cotton planting area, reducing the amount of labor used, and lowering production targets; others advocated mobilizing the masses, carrying out a learning from Li Tianzhu competition, tapping labor potential, and overcoming the difficulties of labor shortage. They believed that the power of the masses is endless, and as long as we are good at relying on the masses, solutions can be found.
    Li Wenliang, the general branch secretary of the Dongkang Management Area, said: "The masses have many methods. Last year, when harvesting in the autumn, the members of Jiasheng Village established three threshing grounds in the fields. With only 24 laborers, they completed a month's work in 13 days, saving 1,338 man-days." This fact reminded everyone, and cadres from management areas such as Duandian, Shenliu, and Jiade cited many examples to show that relying on the masses is the only way to solve the problem. For example, Zhuangli Village in the Dongkang Management Area has a surrounding wall, and the door opens east and west, without a north-south door, while 33% of the total cultivated land in the village is in the north of the village. Although the masses living in the north of the village are only separated from the cultivated land by a wall, for many years they have always had to turn to the east gate and the west gate, detour to go and return, and all the people in the village who grow crops have to walk an extra 15,840 li a year. There are 13 such villages in the whole commune. The commune party committee analyzed these opinions and believed that reforming the unreasonable production process is an important task to thoroughly change the unreasonable phenomena left over from the small-scale peasant economy that restricts the development of production and adapt to the characteristics of collective production. It is an inevitable trend of production development after the people's commune. Therefore, the commune party committee decided to launch a rationalization movement of the production process throughout the commune.
    At present, this mass movement to reform the unreasonable production process has developed vigorously, and the commune members have put forward more than 5,000 rationalization proposals and opinions. The commune summarized the opinions and suggestions of the masses into 20 items, namely: establishing cultivation points in remote areas, exchanging interspersed plots, opening more village gates and walking less (in this area, all villages have built walls and only open east-west or north-south gates, and people must pass through these gates, often having to walk a lot more), rationally dividing cultivation areas, moving livestock pens to the edge of the village, raising pigs in vegetable gardens, moving sheep pens from the village to the fields, establishing wheat threshing grounds in the fields, fertilizing in the fields, adjusting field roads, irrigating sweet potato fields by digging wells beside them, drying jujubes on the spot, establishing cool shelters in the fields, establishing male and female toilets in the fields, and establishing factories on the spot using local materials, etc.
    In just three months, the mass movement for rationalization of the production process has blossomed and borne fruit in the Jiade People's Commune. Among the 20 suggestions, 10 have been realized, saving more than 84,600 man-days, accounting for 28% of the planned labor savings, and saving more than 83,000 animal-days, accounting for 49% of the planned labor savings. The labor shortage problem has been basically solved in this commune. In the first half of this year, the total labor force in the commune decreased by 11.8% compared with last year, but wheat harvesting, threshing, and replanting of late autumn crops were all completed 10 days earlier than last year; cotton field management also achieved no pests, no weeds, and no barren seedlings. Labor efficiency has increased by 20%-30%. Cadres who previously believed that the labor problem could not be solved are now in a cheerful mood and full of energy, and no longer shout about labor difficulties. Li Xiliang, director of the Duandian Management Area, shouted about labor shortage when formulating the production plan in the spring and wanted to lower the production targets. After carrying out the rationalization movement of the production process, he found more than 20 ways to save more than 70,000 man-days. He said happily: "I have learned a real skill this time. In the future, when I encounter difficulties, I will make two requests for instructions: ask the leaders for instructions and ask the masses for instructions." The Taoyuan Production Team in the Dongkang Management Area has 300 sheep, which accumulate 2,400 cartloads of fertilizer every year. They used to transport soil from the fields to pad the pens and transport fertilizer from the village to the fields. After moving the sheep pens to the fields, the labor saved in one year is enough to hoe 800 mu of cotton fields. The exchange of interspersed plots has also made some villages more united, and they have further realized the superiority of the people's commune.
    Now, the commune members are working with joy and full of confidence. Wheat field summer plowing was completed half a month earlier than in the past, and cotton field inter-tillage and soil cultivation have been increased twice compared with last year.

　　发挥公社威力革新生产过程
　　贾得公社倡导生产过程合理化劳力不足问题基本解决
    本报太原19日电　山西省临汾县贾得人民公社充分发挥人民公社的优越性，开展生产过程合理化运动，到年底可节省人工三十一万个和畜工十七万个。中共晋南地委最近在这里召开现场会议，推广这项经验。
    贾得人民公社土地平坦，盛产粮棉。根据国家计划的需要，棉田逐年扩大，用工数量逐年增多；再加上输送了一部分劳力支援工业建设，劳力就更显得不足。按照计划，今年全年需工三百九十九万个，可是社员自报投工只有三百三十八万个，相差六十一万个。3月底，公社党委召开了有管理区党总支书记参加的扩大党委会议，对这个问题专门作了讨论。在会议上明显地表现出两种思想：一部分人主张压缩棉花种植面积，减少用工数量，降低生产指标；一部分人主张发动群众，开展学习李天柱竞赛运动，挖掘劳动潜力，克服劳力不足的困难。他们认为，群众的力量是无穷无尽的，只要我们善于依靠群众，办法是可以找到的。
    东亢管理区总支书记李文亮说：“群众办法多得很。去年收秋时贾升村社员在地头建立了三个打谷场，只二十四个劳力，用了十三天时间，就办完了一个月的事情，节省了一千三百三十八个工。”这个事实提醒了大家，段店、神刘、贾得等管理区的干部们，列举的许多事例也说明依靠群众是唯一解决问题的办法。如东亢管理区庄里村有一道围墙，门是东西开的，没有南北门，而占全村总耕地面积33％的地都在村北。住在村北头的群众，离耕地虽然只有一墙之隔，但是多少年来总要转东门弯西门，绕道而去，拐道而回，全村种庄稼的人一年共要多走一万五千八百四十里。这样的村子全公社有十三个。公社党委分析了这些意见，认为改革不合理的生产过程，是彻底改变小农经济遗留下来的束缚生产发展的不合理现象、适应集体化生产特点的重要工作，是人民公社化之后生产发展的必然趋势。因此，公社党委决定在全社开展一个生产过程合理化运动。
    目前，这个群众性的改革不合理的生产过程的运动已蓬勃发展起来，社员们共提出五千多条合理化建议和意见。公社把群众意见和建议归纳为二十条，即：远地建立耕作点，调换插花地，多开村门少走路（在这个地方各村都修筑了围墙，只开东西两门或南北门，人们出入必须由此门通过，往往要多走许多路），合理划分耕作区，畜圈移在村子边，菜园养猪，羊圈由村移到地，地头建立打麦场，田间沤肥，调整田间道路，红薯地边打井灌溉，就地晒枣，田间建立歇凉棚，地头建立男女厕所，就地取材办工厂等。
    在短短三个月中，生产过程合理化的群众运动已在贾得人民公社开花结果。在二十条建议中，已经实现的十条，节省人工八万四千六百多个、占计划省工数的28％，省畜工八万三千多个、占计划省工数的49％，劳力紧张问题在这个公社已基本得到解决。今年前半年，全社劳动力比去年减少了11.8％，但是小麦收打、复播晚秋等都比去年提前完成十天；棉田管理也做到了无虫、无草、无荒苗。劳动效率提高了20％—30％。过去一直认为劳力问题无法解决的干部，现在心情舒畅，干劲十足，再不叫喊劳力困难。段店管理区主任李希良在春季制定生产计划的时候，大喊劳力不足，想压低生产指标，经过开展生产过程合理化运动，找到二十多条门路，节约人工七万多。他高兴的说：“这次可学到了真本事，以后遇到困难来个两请示，请示领导，请示群众。”东亢管理区桃园生产队有三百只羊，每年积肥二千四百车，由地拉土垫圈，从村往地送肥。把羊圈搬到地里以后，一年省下的工就可把八百亩棉田锄一遍。通过调换插花地也使一些村庄更加团结了，他们进一步认识了人民公社的优越性。
    现在全公社社员喜气洋洋，信心百倍地工作，麦田伏耕比以往提前半月完成，棉田中耕培土比去年增加了两次。
