(Dispatch from our newspaper in Tianjin, August 13) The commercial system of Hebei Province is using its maximum effort to speed up preparations for the autumn harvest and procurement of agricultural products such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp, which is about to arrive.

In order to ensure a fast and good harvest during the procurement season, commercial departments in various regions are establishing specialized institutions according to their needs. At present, communes, management areas, larger market towns, and larger production teams in the vast cotton and hemp economic crop producing areas are generally establishing procurement stations and teams, and supplementing procurement forces, requiring the formation of a procurement network. According to statistics from the cotton-producing areas of Tianjin, Handan, and Shijiazhuang, 485 procurement stations have been established, equipped with more than 5,300 procurement personnel. In Shulu County, 70 procurement points mainly for cotton procurement have been established in the management areas, equipped with more than 700 people, achieving the goal of having procurement personnel in each production team.

Commercial departments are vigorously training technical personnel, strengthening cotton inspection organizations, and making preparations for cotton inspection. Since the beginning of July, the province's commercial system has trained more than 3,600 cotton inspection technical personnel. In addition to supplementing the cotton inspection organizations at the special district and county levels, most of these technical cadres will be assigned to procurement stations and teams. Commercial departments are also helping communes train cotton grading and inspection technical personnel.

The volume of agricultural products such as cotton and hemp purchased after the autumn harvest is very large. On the one hand, the province's commercial system will give full play to the role of the existing 600+ vehicles and 3,000+ horse-drawn carts. On the other hand, it will vigorously organize the transportation forces of the communes and establish transfer stations in order to transport them to processing plants in a timely manner. Nangong County has established 33 transfer stations in places with convenient transportation and equipped them with corresponding personnel, vehicles, and livestock. Hengshui and Shulu counties, which are adjacent to each other, have jointly agreed to break county boundaries and promote direct transportation based on the distribution of processing plants and procurement stations, which is convenient for cotton sales and processing, in order to avoid roundabout transportation and waste of transport capacity after the purchase of agricultural products.

More than 130 cotton ginning factories in the province began comprehensive maintenance in July, and more than 40 factories will be able to put into production after minor repairs.

In order to ensure that agricultural products enter warehouses in a timely manner, the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce has allocated a large number of packaging materials and tarpaulin equipment to Handan, Shijiazhuang, and other places.

(Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 13) While the scorching summer is still pressing, and department stores are still displaying a dazzling array of summer goods, the commercial departments of Wuhan City are already preparing daily-use commodities needed by urban and rural people in the autumn and winter seasons.

As early as this spring, Wuhan City's commercial departments began to formulate supply plans for autumn and winter commodities. The quantity of autumn and winter commodities planned to be organized by the department stores, textile products, hardware, transportation, electrical equipment, cultural supplies, and pharmaceutical companies has increased compared to last year, and the variety of colors and patterns is generally greater than in previous years.

The companies first pay attention to expanding local sources of goods. All that can be produced by local factories are to collaborate with the factories to help them increase production. Up to now, the companies have linked up with 615 large and small factories in Wuhan City, arranging the production of more than 1,200 kinds of autumn and winter commodities. The department store company has coordinated production and sales plans with 146 factories in the city that manufacture shoes, hats, clothing, small commodities, and enamel products, and the total value of processed commodities has increased by nearly one time compared to the same period last year. Among them, due to early arrangements, the current storage volume of cotton clothing, cotton wadding, and rolled cotton accounts for 50% to 80% of the winter supply plan.

Each company has sent procurement personnel to cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, on the one hand, to assist in the transfer of commodities allocated according to the plan, and on the other hand, to purchase commodities outside the planned allocation, provided that they comply with the local market management system. Since July, Wuhan Department Store Company has transferred and purchased underwear, knitted cotton goods, cosmetics, and children's toys from other places, with a total amount of more than 2 million yuan. By the end of July, the textile company had transferred a batch of best-selling fabrics such as khaki, worsted gabardine, and mercerized yarn twill from other places.

When organizing local and foreign sources of goods, the commercial departments of each company adhere to the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, grasping both large commodities and small commodities, both means of production and means of livelihood. Among the autumn and winter commodities organized by the department store company this time, there are 87 kinds of small commodities such as cotton thread, buttons, and shoe eyelets. In addition to arranging the production of means of production, the hardware, transportation, and electrical equipment company also arranged the production of daily necessities such as scissors, kitchen knives, pant hooks, and zippers that are urgently needed in the current market.

Each company tries its best to help local factories overcome difficulties in raw materials, materials, and equipment. After clearing warehouses and recycling waste products, the hardware, transportation, and electrical equipment company recently supported relevant factories with more than 320 tons of pig iron and more than 1,400 tons of steel.

    河北秣马厉兵迎接收购旺季
    武汉商业部门及早动手准备秋冬令日用商品
    本报天津13日电　河北省商业系统正在用最大力量，为迎接即将到来的棉花、烟、麻等农产品秋收采购旺季，加紧进行农产品收购准备工作。
    为了保证收购旺季收得快、收得好，各地商业部门正在根据需要，分别设立专门机构；目前，广大棉、麻经济作物产区的公社、管理区、较大集镇、较大生产队，正在普遍设立采购站、组，并充实采购力量，要求形成一个采购网。据天津、邯郸、石家庄三个产棉地区的统计，已经设立起来的收购站达四百八十五个，配备了五千三百多名采购人员。束鹿县在管理区设立了七十个以收棉花为主的采购点，配备了七百多人，达到了每个生产队都有采购人员。
    商业部门正在大力培训技术人员，加强棉花检验组织，做好棉花检验准备工作。7月上旬以来，全省商业系统已训练出三千六百多名棉花检验技术人员。这些技术干部除了充实专、县棉花检验组织外，大部分将分配到采购站、组。商业部门还在帮助公社训练棉花分级检验技术人员。
    秋后收购起来的棉、麻等农产品运输量很大，全省商业系统一方面将充分发挥现有六百多辆汽车、三千多辆马车的作用，一方面大力组织公社运输力量，建立转运站，以便及时运送到加工厂加工。南宫县已在交通方便的地方建立了三十三个转运站，并且配备了相应的人员、车辆、畜力。毗邻的衡水、束鹿两县，为了避免农产品在收购后迂回运输，浪费运力，共同商妥，打破县界，根据加工厂、采购站的分布，推行直线运输，便于售棉和加工。
    这个省的一百三十多个轧棉厂，已在7月间全面开始检修，有四十多个工厂经过小修，即能投入生产。
    河北省商业厅为使农产品及时入仓，已把大批包装材料和苫垫设备拨往邯郸、石家庄等地。
    据新华社武汉13日电　正当盛暑逼人，百货商店仍然摆着琳琅满目的夏令商品的时候，武汉市商业部门已在为城乡人民准备秋冬季节所需要的日用商品。
    早在今年春天，武汉市商业部门就开始动手制订秋冬令商品的供应计划。百货、纺织品、五金交通电工器材、文化用品和医药等公司计划组织的秋冬令商品，数量都比去年增加，花色品种一般也比往年多。
    各公司首先注意扩大地方货源，凡是本地工厂能够生产的，都尽量同工厂协作，帮助工厂增加生产。到目前为止，各公司已经和武汉市六百一十五个大小工厂挂钩，安排了一千二百多种秋冬令商品的生产。百货公司和全市一百四十六个制造鞋帽、服装、小百货和搪瓷等产品的工厂衔接了产销计划，加工商品的总值比去年同期增加将近一倍。其中棉服、棉絮和卷花三种商品由于提早安排，目前的储存量已占冬季供应计划的50％到80％。
    各公司都派出采购人员到上海、天津、广州和沈阳等城市，一面协助调运按计划分配的商品，一面在遵守当地市场管理制度的前提下，采购计划分配以外的商品。武汉市百货公司从7月份以来，已从外地调运和采购回内衣、针棉织品、化妆用品和儿童玩具等，总金额两百多万元。纺织品公司到7月底止，已经从外地调运到一批卡其、华达呢、元线哔叽等畅销布料。
    商业部门各公司在组织本地和外地货源时，都本着统筹兼顾，全面安排的原则，既抓大商品，也抓小商品，既抓生产资料，也抓生活资料。百货公司这次组织的秋冬令商品中，棉线、钮扣、鞋眼等小商品有八十七种。五金交通电工器材公司除了安排生产资料的生产以外，也安排了当前市场上急需的剪刀、菜刀、裤钩、拉链等生活用品的生产。
    各公司都想尽办法，帮助本地工厂克服原料、材料和设备方面的困难。五金交通电工器材公司经过清理仓库和回收废品，最近支援了有关工厂三百二十多吨生铁和一千四百多吨钢材。
