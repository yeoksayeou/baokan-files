    Stories in Progress

    The Girl's Troubles

    In the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory, there is a girl named Yue Yuxian, who has been feeling troubled these days.

    Not long ago, she adopted the "rapid polishing method" and created a new record of grinding forty-five glass discs per day, all of which were qualified. She became a "pace-setter" in the work section. The workshop leaders wanted her to set up a challenge arena. As soon as the arena was set up, a young man named Liu Jianxiu accepted the challenge. When Little Yue saw that the challenger was Little Liu, she became very worried.

    It turned out that Little Liu and Little Yue had joined the factory together and had even worked on the same machine. The girl knew the young man's strengths and weaknesses very well. This person was full of energy and clever. This caused the girl to worry: he would catch up with me sooner or later. If he really catches up, won't my title of pace-setter be gone?

    The more she worried about being caught up, the faster he caught up. One day, as soon as Little Yue stepped into the workshop, she heard the chairman of the trade union shouting through a loudspeaker: "Comrades, pay attention, Liu Jianfang has surpassed Yue Yuxian! He has created a new record of grinding seventy-five discs per day today!"

    In the crowd, Liu Jianfang, wearing a big red flower, walked to Little Yue with a beaming face and extended his hand. Little Yue reluctantly uttered a few words: "Learn from you..." and turned away.

    Little Yue was really sad... The chairman of the trade union seemed to see into her heart at a glance and asked her warmly and caringly: "What's wrong? Are you really discouraged?" At this, the tears in the girl's eyes could no longer be held back, and she began to cry with great grievance.

    "Crying won't do any good, you still have to pick up your courage!" The chairman of the trade union warmly comforted her: "If the knife is not sharp, sharpen it on a stone; if people don't know how, learn from the world. Didn't Little Liu catch up with you by learning from your experience? Why can't you go and learn from him now?"

            By Comparison

    The next day, Little Yue really went to "learn from experience."

    Little Liu was indeed sincere. He explained in detail everything about machine management, how to use auxiliary materials, and the experience of improving parts grinding, and even gave a demonstration on the spot.

    Soon, Little Yue also started operating two machines, and the output immediately reached eighty-six discs. However, the next day, Liu Jianfang reached one hundred and eight discs. This time, Little Yue was discouraged again. She thought: even though I can do more than eighty discs by operating two machines, I am so nervous that I am about to die. How can I catch up with him again? Little Liu can do more than one hundred discs, and when asked, he even says he is "not busy." Isn't that strange?

    For many days, Little Yue didn't even want to say half a word.

    If you don't ask others, they will come and ask you:

    "Little Yue, when are you planning to surpass me?" Little Liu's question made Little Yue a little excited, and she asked Little Liu: "Why are you able to work so calmly?"

    Little Liu told her all his secrets.

    It turned out that the secret was: When Little Liu operates two machines, he starts them at staggered times, so although he operates two machines, in reality, when one is tight, the other is not, and vice versa, so it is relatively easy to manage; but Little Yue is the opposite, both machines start together, and when they are not tight, they are not tight, and when they are tight, they are tight, so one person is of course unable to cope. Once this was pointed out, Little Yue suddenly understood.

    This time, Little Yue soon surpassed Little Liu.

            "It takes two hands to clap"

    In the evening, Little Yue was alone by the lake, quietly contemplating.

    She thought about many, many things. She thought about Little Liu and also about many people and things in the workshop.

      "Take Little Liu for example, whenever he surpasses me, he is always so humble, enthusiastic, and unreservedly teaches me all his experience, and always tells me: 'You must prepare to surpass me quickly and create even better experience, and I am also prepared to learn from you again.' Whenever I surpass him, I never see him have the slightest anger or jealousy, but always say happily: 'With your help, I must surpass you! You just wait.' He cares about the progress of his comrades more than his own, and considers the progress of others as his greatest pleasure. Why do I always only think of myself?

      "Isn't the Party and the trade union always educating us like this: it is not enough for just one person to be advanced. If only individuals are advanced and cannot drive the collective forward, the entire task will not be completed, which is equivalent to zero, isn't it?"

      "As the saying goes, 'it takes two hands to clap,' which is absolutely correct."

    When she thought this way, Little Yue's thoughts were like the crystal-clear glass discs she had just ground...

                  Gold Dug Out

    This day, Little Yue felt unspeakably relaxed. As she was grinding the glue on the glass on the fixture, she wondered why she couldn't grind four pieces of glue together? She tried it and it worked really well, and she immediately created a new record of one hundred and fifty-five discs. All the work sections came to congratulate Little Yue again... After work, Little Yue was still waiting for Liu Jianfang alone, introducing her experience to him in more detail. Later, Liu Jianfang surpassed her again. When she heard this news, she was happier than anything else. Thinking about the past, Little Yue even felt that she was really too ridiculous.

    Yue Yuxian and Liu Jianfang helped each other in this way, from forty-five discs to seventy-five discs, then to eighty-six discs, one hundred and eight discs, one hundred and fifty-five discs, one hundred and ninety-six discs, two hundred and six discs, and finally, both of them reached two hundred and thirteen discs, which was more than seven times higher than before! All were qualified products. Half of the entire work section caught up with their level, and the production capacity of the polishing process in this workshop increased by about 50% compared to the past. People's communist style grew up in the process of competition under the education of the Party and the trade union.

    This reminds us of a Russian proverb written by Alexei Tolstoy in the trilogy "The Road to Calvary":

      "Soaked three times in clear water,
    Bathed three times in blood,
    Boiled three times in alkaline water.
    We will be cleaner than clean."

    They are gold, but they are also mixed with mud and sand, some with more, some with less. Under the cultivation of the Party, in the crucible of competition, people mature faster and finally shine with golden brilliance.

    前进中的故事
    本报记者　田良耕　金雨困
    姑娘的苦恼
    云南光学仪器厂有一位姑娘叫岳玉仙，这些天来心里老是苦恼。
    不久前，她采用了“快速抛光法”创造了日磨四十五盘玻璃片的新纪录，质量全部合格，成了工段的“标兵”。车间领导上就要她摆起擂台，擂台一摆，小伙子刘建秀和她应了战。小岳一看应战的对象是小刘，从此心事重重。
    原来小刘和小岳是一起进厂的，还在一部机床上干过活。小伙子的底细姑娘摸得清楚，这个人，干劲很足人又聪明。这就引起了姑娘的担心：总有一天要给他赶上的。真给他赶上了，我这个标兵不就垮了么？
    越是担心人家追上来，人家就越是追得快。一天，小岳刚踏进车间，就听见工会主席拿着喇叭在喊：同志们注意，刘建芳已经超过了岳玉仙！今天创造了日磨七十五盘的新纪录！
    人丛中，刘建芳带着大红花，满面春风地走到小岳面前，伸出了手。小岳勉勉强强说出了几个字：“向你学习……”就掉身走开了。
    小岳真是难过极了……工会主席似乎一眼看到了她的心底，热情和关心地问她：“怎么，真是灰心丧气了么？”这一说，姑娘眼眶里的眼泪，就再也忍不住啦，十分委屈地哭起来了。
    “哭是不行的，还得拿起勇气来呀！”工会主席热情地安慰她：“刀不快，石上磨，人不会，世上学。小刘不是学习了你的经验，才赶过了你吗？现在你为什么不能去学习呢？”
            相形之下
    第二天，小岳就真去“取经”了。
    小刘确是真心实意，什么机床管理罗，怎么用副料和改进零件研磨的经验罗，都介绍得详详细细，而且当场作了表演。
    不久，小岳也开起了两台机床，产量马上到了八十六盘。可是，第二天刘建芳又到了一百零八盘。这下子小岳又泄了气。她想：开了两台也做到了八十多盘，可是人就紧张得要命，怎么能够再赶过人家呢？人家小刘做到了一百多盘，问问他还讲是
  “不忙”，不是奇怪吗？
    好些天，小岳又是连半句话都不想讲。
    你不问人家，人家可来问你了：
    “小岳呀，你打算什么时候超过我呀？”小刘这么一问，小岳不免有些激动，就问小刘：“你为什么能够干得这样从容？”
    小刘就把自己的窍门全部告诉了她。
    原来窍门是：小刘开两部机床时，把时间一前一后交叉开了，因此开的虽是两部，但实际上是此紧彼不紧，彼紧此不紧，因此看管起来比较从容；而小岳却相反，两部机床一起开始，不紧张时都不紧张，一紧张时都紧张，这样一个人当然无法应付。这样一点破，小岳才恍然大悟。
    这次小岳不久就赶过了小刘。
            “一个巴掌拍不响”
    傍晚，小岳一个人在湖边静思默想。
    她想了很多很多，她想到了小刘也想到了车间许多的人和事。
      “就拿小刘来说吧，每当他赶过了我时，他总是那样地谦虚、热情和毫无保留地把全部经验教给我，而且总要嘱咐我：‘你要准备快点超过我，把更好的经验创造出来，我也准备再向你学习。’每当我超过他时，从不见他有半点气愤和嫉妒，而总是高兴地说：‘在你的帮助之下，我一定要超过你的！你准备着吧。’人家关心同志的进步超过了自己，把别人的进步当作自己最大的愉快。为什么我总是只想到自己？
      “党和工会不是经常这样教育我们：光是一个人先进是不够的。如果仅仅个人先进，不能把集体带动起来，整个任务完不成，那还不等于零吗？”
      “俗语说：‘一个巴掌拍不响’，这一点也不错。”
    当这样考虑的时候，小岳的思想就像她刚磨出来的晶莹透明的玻璃片一样……。
                  淘出的金子
    这一天，小岳心头说不出的轻松。她在研磨胶在夹具上的玻璃的时候想，为什么不可以四块胶在一起磨呢？一试果然很好，马上创造了一百五十五盘的最高纪录。各个工段都又来给小岳祝贺……下班以后，小岳还一个人在那里等待刘建芳，把自己的经验更详细地向他介绍。以后刘建芳又超过了她。当她听到这些消息时简直高兴得比什么都喜欢。想想过去的情形，小岳连自己也觉得实在太可笑了。
    岳玉仙和刘建芳就这样你帮我我帮你，由四十五盘跃到七十五盘、又进到八十六盘、一百零八盘、一百五十五盘、一百九十六盘、二百零六盘，最后两个人都达到二百一十三盘，比原来提高了七倍多！都是合格品。整个工段有一半人赶上了他们的水平，这个车间的抛光工序生产能力比过去提高了50％左右。人们的共产主义风格，就在竞赛的进程中，党与工会的教育下成长起来了。
    这使我们想起了阿·托尔斯泰在“苦难的历程”三部曲中写的一首俄罗斯民谚：
      “在清水里泡三次，
    在血水里浴三次，
    在碱水里煮三次。
    我们就会干净得不能再干净了。”
    他们是金子，但是也夹杂泥沙，有的人多，有的人少，在党的培养下，在竞赛的熔炉中，人们更快地成熟了，终于闪出金色的光辉。
