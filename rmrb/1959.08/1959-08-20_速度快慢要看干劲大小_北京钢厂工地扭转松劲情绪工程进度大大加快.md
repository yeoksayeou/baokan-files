Speed Depends on Enthusiasm
Beijing Steel Plant Construction Site Reverses Slack Mood, Project Progress Greatly Accelerated

(Our report) The Beijing Steel Plant construction site of the Beijing Sixth Construction Engineering Company, after inspecting and criticizing the slack mood of a few cadres who were neglecting the finishing work, the workers mustered greater enthusiasm, and a lively construction scene appeared on the construction site, greatly accelerating the project progress.

This construction site once completed the main structure project, which accounted for 54% of the basic construction workload of the ingot casting workshop, in only thirty-six working days, and was well received in terms of both quality and speed. However, after the ingot casting workshop entered the finishing stage from the beginning of July, a few leading cadres on the construction site developed a complacent and slack mentality. They believed that "the main structure has been completed and handed over for installation, and the remaining finishing part only includes three projects: bricklaying, roofing, and piping. It is okay to construct slowly." With the relaxation in thinking, the project progress immediately slowed down. The original plan to complete the project by July 15th was delayed again and again. By the end of July, only one-half of the bricklaying project and one-third of the roofing project had been completed. According to this progress, the finishing project plan was as long as seventy-nine days, which was more than twice the time it took to complete the main structure project.

This slack finishing plan caused a cold and loose atmosphere on the construction site. The previously effective system of leading cadres meeting on site every day was no longer implemented. Some cadres no longer tried every means to create construction conditions, but waited for favorable conditions to arrive. For example, in the bricklaying and roofing projects, due to the lack of fir battens and water slag, they waited for half a month without starting construction.

After the People's Daily published the editorial "Overcome Rightist Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" on August 6th, the construction site's Party branch held an enlarged meeting of the branch committee overnight and inspected the work in accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial and the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee. Everyone felt that due to the slack mood and neglect of the finishing work, the ingot casting workshop could not be put into production at an early date, which "fell short of success" regarding the achievements created by the main structure project. After clarifying the understanding, and after practical calculation, a new completion plan was re-formulated, and the completion date of the ingot casting workshop was advanced by twenty days at once. When discussing the new completion plan, the workers of all twenty-eight teams and groups on the construction site carefully calculated the accounts item by item, formulated measures one by one, and pledged to complete the project one to three days ahead of schedule.

In order to realize this new plan, the leading departments of the construction site adopted five specific measures. First, resolutely implement the policy of concentrating forces to fight annihilation wars, and transferred two hundred workers from three other units to carry out a rush to complete the ingot casting workshop project; second, mobilize the masses to formulate phased, batch-based, and project-based construction plans, dividing the finishing project into three battles: bricklaying, roofing, and piping, for a quick and decisive victory; third, strengthen the cooperation between the construction site and the construction unit, establish a joint finishing completion command, restore the on-site command and the system of leading cadres meeting once a day; fourth, each engineering project and material supply is assigned to a specific person to be responsible for and operate; fifth, establish a safety technical supervision station to check at any time to ensure project quality. The entire construction site also held a finishing completion mobilization and competition conference, and launched a vigorous competition movement. On the competition platforms and red flag lists set up on the construction site, the deeds of new record creators appeared every day. Within seven days from August 8th to 14th, more than 90% of the workers on this construction site had created new records, and labor efficiency increased by an average of 50%, and the quality was also greatly improved.

The day after the competition conference, it rained heavily. When the rain was heavy, the bricklayers discussed measures on site; when the rain was slightly lighter, they braved the rain to prepare the materials for bricklaying the next day. The next day, the bricklaying team workers enthusiastically launched a competition. The bricklaying team of Chen Qi created a new record when using sliding frames for bricklaying, and the efficiency was doubled compared to before the competition. As a result, the bricklayers completed the bricklaying task originally planned to be completed in five days one day ahead of schedule.

The leading cadres of this construction site are now personally going to the front line, directly commanding production, and working with the workers. When rushing to complete the roof plastering project, the workers were greatly encouraged to see the director of the construction site helping to push the trolley to transport ash. Many people said: "The director is working as a porter for us, we guarantee to let the furnace flow out steel water ahead of schedule!"

### 速度快慢要看干劲大小　北京钢厂工地扭转松劲情绪工程进度大大加快

　　速度快慢要看干劲大小
　　北京钢厂工地扭转松劲情绪工程进度大大加快
    本报讯　北京市第六建筑工程公司北京钢厂工地在检查和批判了少数干部忽视收尾工程的松劲情绪以后，职工们鼓起更大的干劲，工地上出现了热火朝天的施工场面，工程进度大大加快。
    这个工地曾经只用三十六个工作日就完成了占铸锭车间基本建设工作量54％的主体结构工程，在质量和速度方面都获得好评。但是，当铸锭车间从7月初进入收尾阶段以后，工地的少数领导干部产生了一种自满松劲思想。他们认为“主体结构已经完工，并已交付安装，残留的收尾部分，只有砌砖、屋面和管道三项工程，慢慢施工就可以了。”思想上一松劲，工程进度立即缓慢下来。原订7月15日扫尾竣工的计划，一拖再拖，到7月底，还只完成了二分之一的砌砖工程，三分之一的屋面工程。按照这种进度制订的收尾工程计划，时间长达七十九天，等于完成主体结构工程所用的时间两倍多。
    这种松劲的扫尾竣工计划，使工地上出现了冷冷清清、松松懈懈的气氛。过去行之有效的领导干部在现场天天碰头等制度，都不坚持执行了。有些干部不再千方百计地去创造施工条件，而是坐等有利条件的到来。例如，在砌砖和屋面工程中，因为缺少杉槁和水渣两种材料，坐等了半个月还没有施工。
    8月6日，人民日报发表“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论以后，工地党支部连夜召开支委扩大会议，根据人民日报社论的精神和市委指示检查了工作。大家感到，由于产生松劲情绪、忽视收尾工程，使铸锭车间不能早日投入生产，对主体结构工程创造的成绩是
  “功亏一篑”。在认识明确以后，经过切实计算，重新制订了竣工计划，把铸锭车间收尾竣工的工期一下子提前了二十天。全工地二十八个队、组的工人，在讨论新的竣工计划时，逐项算细账，逐条订措施，纷纷保证提前一天到三天完成。
    为了实现这个新计划，工地领导部门采取了五项具体措施。一、坚决贯彻集中兵力打歼灭战的方针，从其他三个单位抽调了二百个工人来突击完成铸锭车间的工程；二、发动群众制定分期、分批、分项目的施工计划，把收尾工程分成砌砖、屋面、管道三个战役，速战速决；三、加强工地和建设单位的协作，成立收尾竣工联合指挥部，恢复现场指挥部和领导干部一天一碰头等制度；四、每项工程项目和物资供应，都确定专人负责，专人经营；五、建立安全技术监督站，随时检查，保证工程质量。全工地还举行了收尾竣工誓师比武大会，开展了轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动。工地上设置的比武台、红旗榜，每天都出现新纪录创造者的事迹。在8日到14日的七天内，这个工地已有90％以上的工人创造了新纪录，劳动效率平均提高了50％，质量也大大提高。
    比武大会后的第二天，正遇到一场大雨。瓦工们当雨大的时候，就在现场讨论措施；雨势稍小就冒雨备齐了下一天砌砖的料。第二天，瓦工队的工人们热烈展开竞赛。砌砖工陈起小组在用滑动架子砌砖时，创造了新纪录，效率较比武前提高了一倍，结果，瓦工们提前一天完成了原计划五天完工的砌砖任务。
    这个工地的领导干部现在都亲自上前线，直接指挥生产，和工人一起劳动，在突击屋面抹灰工程时，工人们看到工地主任帮助推小车运灰，都大为振奋。不少人说：“主任给我们当搬运工人，我们保证提前叫炉子流出钢水！”
