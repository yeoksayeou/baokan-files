    Last Year's Efforts Deep, This Year's Harvest Good
    Early Rice Production Greatly Increased in Nancheng County, Jiangxi
    (Our Nanchang Dispatch, 28th) The fact that Nancheng County, Jiangxi Province, reaped a bumper harvest of early rice this year powerfully demonstrates that the Great Leap Forward of last year laid a material and ideological foundation for this year's bumper harvest.
    Of the 225,000 mu of early rice planted in Nancheng County this year, more than 112,800 mu have been harvested. After threshing, drying, and winnowing, the average yield per mu increased by more than 40% compared to last year.
    Nancheng is located between high mountains and hills. The soil is sandy and rocky, and clayey. The climate varies greatly between cold and warm, and rainfall is either excessive or insufficient. The great bumper harvest of early rice achieved under these unfavorable natural conditions has greatly encouraged the 140,000 people in the county. People are overjoyed and say that last year's Great Leap Forward was a fruitful tree that has borne more and better fruit this year.
    According to the experience of veteran farmers in early rice production over the years, the key prerequisite for determining the success or failure of early rice production in mountainous areas is water. However, before liberation, 350,000 mu of land in this county were under constant threat of severe drought due to lack of irrigation water. Crop failures due to drought were a common occurrence. Although a water conservancy project that irrigated 1,000 mu of farmland was built in the late Ming Dynasty, it had long been dilapidated due to years of disrepair. After liberation, although some water conservancy projects were repaired every year, they still could not solve the problem of water shortage. During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, the Nancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the greatest determination and effort, led the people of the county in building ten large-scale irrigation projects of more than 10,000 mu each and more than 1,000 small-scale irrigation projects, enabling more than 200,000 mu of farmland to withstand drought for more than half a year and 100,000 mu to withstand drought for about 50 days. The area of land with irrigation facilities in the county accounted for 95% of the total, and irrigation was automated. Therefore, although the county experienced drought conditions this year that were no less severe than in previous years during the peak growing season of early rice, the water conservancy of the county's farmland meant that there was no feeling of threat from drought. Now, both cadres and the masses in this county generally recognize that the water conservancy projects built during the Great Leap Forward last year are an important material foundation for this year's bumper harvest of early rice.
    The fact that experimental fields in Nancheng County achieved a yield of 1,000 jin per mu during the Great Leap Forward last year liberated the minds of most cadres and made most of the masses generally realize that the "Eight-Character Charter" is a treasure. Therefore, it was smoother to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" this year. A very obvious example is that when the requirement for close planting was put forward last year, all kinds of ideological resistance were reflected, but after the practical education of last year's high-yield production, people believed that close planting was an important measure to increase production when the requirement for rational close planting of early rice was put forward this year. Therefore, most of the early rice this year achieved rational close planting. When deep plowing tools were promoted last year, the masses had concerns, saying that deep plowing would affect the soil structure and that the cattle power was insufficient. After the experiment in last year's high-yield fields, many advantages such as drought resistance, developed roots of seedlings, and resistance to lodging were found. This year, more than 80% of the old plows were equipped with Jiangxi paddy field plows that meet the requirements of deep plowing, and deep plowing was generally carried out in early rice fields.
    Nancheng County also gained a complete set of field management experience from last year's Great Leap Forward, especially the comprehensive application of the five "early" characters (early plowing, early soaking of seeds, early sowing, early transplanting, early harvesting) to overcome the harsh climate of mountainous areas. The ground temperature in mountainous areas is very low, and 30% of the fields are "cold water" fields. Due to the experience gained in increasing ground temperature last year, 90% of the early rice this year was plowed one season earlier, so it was exposed to sunlight for a longer time, which increased the ground temperature. The early soaking of seeds was only carried out by cadres in experimental fields last year, but since it was concluded that early sowing resulted in strong seedlings, early soaking of seeds was generally carried out this year. Transplanting was also carried out earlier, which not only ensured a growth period of more than 90 days for excellent varieties, but also avoided the contradiction between the late growth of early rice and the timing of late rice transplanting. Last year, some early rice was planted early and harvested early, so late rice transplanting was also advanced, resulting in a double bumper harvest of early and late rice. Another part of the early rice was planted late and matured late. In order to take care of late rice transplanting, some early rice was harvested while it was still green, which reduced the yield. Some delayed the transplanting time of the second crop of late rice in order to allow the early rice to mature and be harvested, so the late rice was damaged by frost when it was flowering, resulting in a reduced yield. This year, according to the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, the uncoordinated and partial advancements of last year have been developed into a comprehensive and planned advancement, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice.

### 去年功夫深  今年收成好  江西南城县今年早稻大增产

    去年功夫深  今年收成好
    江西南城县今年早稻大增产
    本报南昌28日电江西南城县今年早稻大丰收的事实，有力地说明了去年大跃进为今年的大丰收奠定了物质基础和思想基础。
    南城县今年种植的二十二万五千亩早稻已有十一万二千八百多亩收割完毕，经过脱粒、晒干扬净，每亩平均产量比去年增产四成多。
    南城地处高山与丘陵之间，土质都是沙石土和粘性土壤，气候寒暖悬殊大，雨水不是过量就是不及。在这种不利的自然条件下取得的早稻大丰收，给全县十四万人民以极大的鼓舞。人们喜气洋洋，都说去年大跃进是株丰硕的果树，今年结出了更多更好的果子。
    根据老农民历年早稻生产的经验，决定山区早稻生产成败命运的重要前提是水。但解放前这个县有三十五万亩土地因为缺水灌溉，常年处于严重的旱灾威胁中。因旱灾造成颗粒不收，已成通常现象。全县在明朝末年虽曾修过一座灌田千亩的水利工程，但因年久失修早已残破不堪。解放后，虽然年年修了一些水利工程，还是不能解决缺水的困难。1958年农业生产大跃进中，中共南城县委以最大的决心和努力，带领全县人民兴修了十座万亩以上的大型灌溉工程和一千多座小型灌溉工程，使二十多万亩农田抗旱能力达到半年以上，十万亩抗旱能力达到五十天左右。全县有灌溉设施的土地面积占到95％，而且达到了灌溉自流化。因此，今年全县早稻生长盛期虽也发生过不亚于往年的旱象，但由于全县农田水利化，再也没有感到干旱的威胁。现在这个县无论干部或群众都普遍地认识到：去年大跃进中兴修的水利工程是今年早稻大丰收的重要物质基础。
    南城县在去年大跃进中试验田出现亩产千斤的事实，使绝大部分干部解放了思想，也使绝大部分群众普遍认识到“八字宪法”是个宝。因此，今年贯彻
  “八字宪法”更顺利了。极明显的例证是：去年提出密植要求时，各式各样的思想抵触都反映了出来，但经过去年的丰产实际教育，今年提出早稻合理密植要求时，人们就认为密植是增产的重要措施。因此，今年早稻绝大部分做到了合理密植。去年推广深耕工具时，群众有顾虑，说深耕影响土壤结构，牛力也不足。经过去年的丰产田的试验，找出了深耕耐旱、禾苗根部发达、不易倒伏等许多优点，今年即有80％以上的旧犁架装上了符合深耕要求的江西水田犁，早稻田普遍进行了深耕。
    南城县还从去年大跃进中取得了成套的田间管理经验，特别是战胜山区恶劣气候的五个“早”字（早翻耕、早浸种、早播种、早插秧、早收割）的全面运用。这里山区地温很低，有30％是“冷水”田，由于去年取得了增高地温的经验，今年即有90％的早稻提早了一个季节翻耕，因而得到较长时间的阳光暴晒，提高了地温。提早浸种季节在去年还只是干部在试验田中进行，由于从中得出了早播种、秧苗壮的结论，今年普遍提早浸种。插秧也提早了季节，这不但保证了优良品种九十多天的生长时期，也避免了早稻后期生长与晚稻插秧的时间上的矛盾。去年一部分早稻由于栽的早、收割早，晚稻插秧也就节节提早，早稻与晚稻双丰收。另一部分早稻则因栽的迟、成熟晚，有的为照顾晚稻插秧就带青收割早稻，以致减低产量；有的为使早稻得到成熟收割，就推迟了二季晚稻的插秧时间，因而晚稻在扬花时就受了霜冻以致减产。今年根据去年大跃进的经验，就把去年不连贯的、局部的提早，发展为全面的有计划的节节提早，因而取得早稻空前的丰收。　（洪崖）（附图片）
