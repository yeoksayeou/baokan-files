Seize the Favorable Opportunity of Hot Weather and Abundant Grass
Inner Mongolia and Yunnan Intensify Green Manure Production

    Xinhua News Agency – A mass fertilizer accumulation movement centered on composting green manure has been launched successively in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. While doing a good job in the late-stage management of major autumn crops, farmers of all ethnic groups are seizing the current opportunity of high temperatures, sufficient rainfall, and vigorous weed growth to vigorously intensify the composting of green manure.

    In the work of composting green manure, rural people's communes in various parts of Inner Mongolia focus on grasping organization, methods, and quality, so that the fertilizer accumulation and production movement is gradually deepened and significant results are achieved in a short period of time. Most communes in Ar Horqin Banner have achieved dedicated leadership for fertilizer accumulation, each production team has a specialized fertilizer accumulation team, every household has a manure pit, every family has a toilet, livestock have pens, chickens and ducks have nests, everyone has a fertilizer accumulation plan, and every household has a fertilizer accumulation task; each production team has also universally established chemical fertilizer factories, bacterial fertilizer factories, granular fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories; at the same time, they have conscientiously carried out evaluation competitions such as checking leadership and comparing command, checking quantity and comparing quality, checking measures and comparing technology, and checking progress and comparing time. In this way, the entire banner has accumulated a large number of better-quality fertilizers during the rainy season. In order to reduce transportation capacity, many communes in Aohan Banner have adopted the method of digging pits in the fields, accumulating fertilizer in the fields, cutting grass on the spot, and composting on the spot, which greatly speeds up the progress of fertilizer accumulation.

    In some rural areas where animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion, in addition to vigorously developing green manure, great attention is also paid to accumulating livestock manure. Communes in Keshiketeng Banner, Kalaqin Banner, and other places have successively erected livestock pens in mountain pastures and in the wild, with herders responsible for grazing and fattening livestock while accumulating large amounts of cattle and sheep manure.

    Xinhua News Agency – Public communes in various parts of Yunnan Province have seized the current favorable opportunity of lush weeds, green branches and leaves, and high temperatures to concentrate their efforts on accumulating green manure. At present, the province has accumulated 16 billion catties of green manure, plus farmyard manure, soil fertilizer, and other fertilizers, which not only provide topdressing for a considerable amount of autumn harvest crops, but also prepare nearly 30% of the fertilizer for the spring crops to be sown this winter. Various localities are continuing to mobilize troops and expand the fertilizer accumulation team, striving to accumulate enough fertilizer for the spring crops within this month.

    In carrying out the summer fertilizer accumulation movement in Yunnan Province, inspections, ranking, and yield estimation were carried out on the seedlings of autumn harvest crops in advance, so that cadres and the masses could recognize the current situation, boost their enthusiasm, and vigorously accumulate fertilizer. In the previous period, Zhaotong Prefecture had insufficient fertilizer and slow topdressing progress. After inspection, commune members realized that if they did not seize the opportunity to accumulate fertilizer, it would inevitably affect the increase in production of autumn harvest crops, and the fertilizer accumulation work of various communes was launched immediately. At present, this prefecture has become a region with relatively fast fertilizer accumulation progress in the province. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods, various localities have flexibly arranged labor according to different conditions such as early and late, sunny and rainy, and light and heavy farm work, rationally resolved fertilizer accumulation remuneration, implemented a responsibility system of fixing people, time, work points, quality, and quantity, and at the same time promoted the small contracting system, so that "every piece has a general, every block has a soldier, and everything is managed," so the progress of fertilizer accumulation in some areas is very fast.

    In the process of fertilizer accumulation, various localities pay attention to both quantity and quality.

　　抓紧天热草多的有利时机
　　内蒙古云南突击沤制绿肥
    据新华社讯　一个以沤压绿肥为中心的群众性积肥运动，已在内蒙古自治区各地陆续展开。各民族农民在作好大秋作物后期管理的同时，抓紧目前气温高、雨水足、杂草生长旺盛的时机，大力突击沤压绿肥。
    内蒙古各地农村人民公社在沤压绿肥工作中，着重抓组织、抓方法、抓质量，使积肥造肥运动逐步深入，短期内就获得显著成绩。阿鲁科尔沁旗大部分公社已做到积肥有专人领导，每个生产队都有积肥专业队，户户有粪坑，家家有厕所，牲畜有圈，鸡鸭有窝，人人有积肥计划，户户有积肥任务；各生产队还普遍建立了化肥厂、菌肥厂、颗粒肥料厂和农药厂；同时认真地开展了查领导比指挥、查数量比质量、查措施比技术、查进度比时间等评比竞赛。这样，全旗在雨季中就积造了大批质量较好的肥料。敖汉旗许多公社为减轻运输力，采取地头挖坑、积肥到田、就地割草、就地沤压的方法，使积肥进度大为加快。
    在畜牧业比重较大的一些农村里，除大搞绿肥外，对积攒牲畜粪肥也很注意。克什克腾旗、喀喇沁旗等地公社，纷纷在山间牧场和野外架设畜圈，由牧工负责一边放牧抓膘，一边大量积攒牛羊粪。
    据新华社讯　云南省各地公社抓住目前杂草茂盛、枝青叶绿、气温又高的有利时机，集中力量大积绿肥。现在，全省已积绿肥一百六十亿斤，加上厩肥、土化肥等肥料，不仅使相当数量的秋收作物有了追肥，还为今冬播种的小春作物准备了近30％的肥料。各地还在继续调兵遣将扩大积肥队伍，力争在这个月内积足小春作物的肥料。
    云南省在开展夏季积肥运动中，事先都对秋收作物苗棵作了检查、排队和估产，使干部和群众认清当前形势，鼓足干劲，大力积肥。昭通专区前些时期肥料不足，追肥进度迟缓，经过检查，社员们认识到如不抓紧积肥，势必影响秋收作物增产，各公社的积肥工作随即开展起来。目前，这个专区已成为全省积肥进度较快的地区。在积肥方法上，各地都根据早晚、晴雨、农活轻繁等不同情况灵活安排劳力，合理解决积肥报酬，实行定人、定时、定工分、定质、定量的责任制，同时推行小包工制，作到“片片有将，块块有兵，事事有人管”，因而有些地区积肥进度很快。
    各地在积肥当中，注意了数量与质量并重。
