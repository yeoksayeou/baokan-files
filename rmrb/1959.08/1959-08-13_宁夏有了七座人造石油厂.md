Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 12th -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which produced not a single pound of petroleum before October last year, now has seven artificial petroleum plants with an annual output of 300 to 1,000 tons. These artificial petroleum plants are distributed in Zhongwei, Shizuishan, Ningshuo, Pingluo, Longde, Huinong and other places.

With the improvement of production technology and management level, the shale oil extraction rate of these factories is also constantly increasing. Zhongwei County Kerosene Plant improved its operating technology, added a cooling tower, and replaced the exhaust fan, increasing the extraction rate from 66% to about 85%. In the past, some factories could only produce one ton of oil after distilling seventeen tons of shale at a time; now, they can produce one and a half tons of oil with the same amount of shale.

In the past six months, great achievements have also been made in petroleum processing and comprehensive utilization. In the first half of the year, Zhongwei Refinery successfully trial-produced nine products including kerosene, diesel, heavy diesel, wax-containing oil, machine oil, paraffin wax, asphalt, lubricating grease and lubricating oil. Some products have been certified by chemical tests to meet the specified quality standards.

The Ningxia area is rich in artificial petroleum resources, with both oil shale with high oil content and coal of good quality.

### 宁夏有了七座人造石油厂

　　宁夏有了七座人造石油厂
    新华社银川12日电去年10月以前不出产一斤石油的宁夏回族自治区，现在已有了七座年产三百吨到一千吨的人造石油厂。这些人造石油厂分布在中卫、石咀山、宁朔、平罗、隆德、惠农等地。
    随着生产技术和管理水平的提高，这些厂的页岩炼率也在不断提高。中卫县煤油厂改进操作技术，增设冷却塔，更换了抽风机以后，炼率由66％提高到85％左右。过去有些厂干馏一次装十七吨页岩，只能出油一吨；现在装同样数量的页岩，可以出油一吨半。
    半年来，在石油加工和综合利用方面，也取得了很大成绩。中卫炼油厂上半年试制成功了煤油，柴油，重柴油，含腊油，机油、石腊、沥青、润滑脂和润滑油等九种产品，有的产品经过化验证明已经达到规定的质量标准。
    宁夏地区的人造石油资源丰富，既有含油较高的油页岩，也有质量很好的煤炭。
