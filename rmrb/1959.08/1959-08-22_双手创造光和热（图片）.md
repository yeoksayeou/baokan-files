    The construction of the Yangouxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River in Gansu Province is progressing rapidly. Under the battle cry of ensuring quality and racing against the flood, the workers have, in just three months since the river was dammed on April 26, increased the height of the dam by fourteen meters and excavated the foundation of the hydropower station plant by twenty meters. This is the construction site of the Yangouxia Hydropower Station. Xinhua News Agency reporter Fu Zhenxin photo
