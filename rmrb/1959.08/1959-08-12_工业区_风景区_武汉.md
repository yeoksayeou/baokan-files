    Industrial Zone, Scenic Area – Wuhan
    Li Erzhong

    The clock tower of the Wuhan Customs House rises into the clouds, standing solemnly, majestically, and justly on the northern bank of the Yangtze River. It meticulously urges Wuhan's time forward, meticulously recording Wuhan's time; it is a witness to Wuhan's modern history.

    Its sound is loud and melodious; its sound is forever full of summoning power.

    February 7, 1923, how strong, tragic, and tenacious its sound was! Its sound accompanied the heroic roars and actions of the Chinese working class. Everyone knows that the heroic brilliance of Shi Yang and Lin Xiangqian inspired the laboring people of the whole country. Their blood was spilled here, watering the revolutionary seedlings of Wuhan and cultivating the revolutionary flowers of the whole country. This heroic revolutionary tradition has been carried forward among the workers and laboring people of Wuhan during the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, blossoming into countless revolutionary flowers and bearing countless revolutionary fruits.

    Martyr Shi Yang was buried at the foot of Hongshan Mountain, among a pile of messy graves. Someone, no one knows who, erected a stele in front of his grave, inscribed with "Tomb of Martyr Shi Yang." The tomb soil formed a platform, with wild grass growing lushly. In the past, every year on February 7th or May 1st, this grave would be adorned with flowers and offerings, but no one knew who put them there or when. The reactionaries understood in their hearts that this was called "the spirit of Shi Yang is immortal." The reactionaries were unwilling to accept this and tried every means to find the group of people offering flowers, but just like their attempts to eliminate the entire revolutionary force, they were in vain.

    On the eve of liberation in 1949, the reactionaries opened a road in the Hongshan area, and the road was pointing directly at Shi Yang's tomb. It was common for the reactionaries to extort the masses at every step, and this matter was no exception. Faced with a group of messy graves, the reactionaries had an idea. They clamored loudly, saying:
    "All graves must be moved within one day, and those that are not moved will be leveled." Many grave owners did not have time to move the graves, so they had to pay the reactionaries for leniency. The reactionaries were very interested in Shi Yang's grave, thinking that they could make a fortune from it, but completely beyond their expectations, overnight, Shi Yang's grave and stele were moved to a place dozens of meters away from the road.

    Now, Shi Yang's grave has been moved to the waist of Hongshan Mountain, and a memorial碑 stands high, facing the clock tower of the Wuhan Customs House from afar.

    Shi Yang and Lin Xiangqian will forever live in the hearts of the laboring people. In the struggle against the extraordinary flood in 1954, heroes such as Yan Zhongliang and Jia Mingwu emerged, resolutely sacrificing themselves to protect the safety of the city. In 1959, Han Wendi appeared, risking his life to save machines and comrades, and the heroic deed of the thirteen-year-old boy Lü Xisan sacrificing himself to save a drowning child. All of this continues in both the revolutionary period and the construction period.

    The Wuhan Customs House clock is ringing. It is a witness to Wuhan's modern history: Wuhan is one of the sacred places of the Chinese revolution.

    Going south from Shi Yang's tomb is the Baotong Temple. Entering the temple, climbing the mountain, the trees are shady and the grass is green. At the top of Hongshan Peak is the location of the Hongshan Pagoda.尉迟敬德 of the Tang Dynasty was enfeoffed as the Prince of Chu and built this pagoda. Climbing the tower, you can have a panoramic view of the three towns. The Hanshui River is like a belt, dividing Hanyang and Hankou. The Yangtze River is spread out like a white ribbon, flowing vast and long. The Beijing-Guangzhou Railway runs vertically through the three towns, with ships and sailboats filling the water and trains and cars running all over the land. The banks of the Yangtze River are full of docks. Seeing this, people will immediately think of a concept that is circulated everywhere: "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces."

    Beside the clock tower of the Wuhan Customs House is a tall building, which is the Nisshin Company of Japanese imperialism. Below the Nisshin Company is the Taikoo Wharf of British imperialism. In short, going downstream from the Wuhan Customs House, Hankou was full of concessions of British, French, Russian, German, Japanese, and other imperialists—of course, these have all become historical relics.

    The "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces" during the reactionary rule meant concentrating the raw materials of the central and southern regions of China in Wuhan for processing and sorting, and then taking them away by various imperialists. The various imperialists transported goods to Wuhan to sell to various places. This "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces" was the center for imperialist aggression.

    The revolution was victorious, and Wuhan became the people's "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces." New docks and train marshalling stations have been built and are being built here, gradually increasing mechanized loading and unloading equipment. This "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces" city is playing an increasingly important role.

    Thinking of this, you will naturally notice the nationally famous Yangtze River Bridge.

    The completion of the Yangtze River Bridge is due to the leadership of the Party, the creative labor of Chinese workers, the help of the Soviet Union, and the support of the whole country. It is a creation of the Chinese people and a crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship. How important is the Yangtze River Bridge? Just close your eyes and think about it: a ton of goods is transported to Hankou, unloaded from the train, loaded onto a ship, unloaded from the ship again, transported to Wuchang Railway Station, and then loaded onto a train and transported to the south. How much labor would this cost and how much difficulty would it add? But now, it can be passed through effortlessly. Think again, tens of thousands of passengers travel from south to north and from north to south every day. If they had to cross by ferry once, how much time would it take? But now, they can pass through unconsciously. I think there is no need to say more about these, every Chinese person will understand.

    The construction of the Yangtze River Bridge started in September 1955, using the most advanced technology in the world for bridge construction—the caisson drilling method. At the beginning, the workers were not familiar with the operation of many machines, and the large caissons were not made well. However, they exerted the inherent perseverance and tenacious spirit of the Chinese working class, they said:
      "As long as it exists in the world, there is nothing we cannot learn."

    "The Yangtze River Bridge must be built with our own hands!"

    In July 1957, the bridge was basically completed, only the bridge deck project and the roads at both ends of the bridge were not completed. A Westerner came here, and we introduced to him that the bridge would be open to traffic on October 15th. He shrugged his shoulders and tilted his head, saying:
    "I will admire you if you can open the bridge to traffic in another half a year!"

    On October 15, 1957, the railway and highway of the Yangtze River Bridge were opened to traffic at the same time.

    The emergence of the Yangtze River Bridge shows the infinite creative power of our Chinese working class, shows the powerful strength of Sino-Soviet friendship, shows the superiority of socialism, and also marks the inevitable death of the old society.

    The emergence of the Yangtze River Bridge has made the three towns of Wuhan a transportation center that contributes more and more to the socialist cause.

    When your mind is fully focused on the Yangtze River Bridge on the Hongshan Pagoda, accidentally turning your face to the right, you will be immediately attracted by a beautiful lake.

    If you have been to West Lake and paid attention to the ancients' praise of West Lake, you must remember Su Dongpo and Bai Juyi's poems. They used many good adjectives to dedicate to West Lake, this is because they have not seen East Lake. East Lake's being valued and decorated is a matter after the victory of the revolution. Li Bai had been to Wuhan several times, and poets such as Du Fu, Cui Hao, and Lu You had also been there, but they had not visited East Lake, so they did not leave a poem praising her. Fortunately, Comrade Zhu De made an appropriate evaluation of it:

    "East Lake temporarily concedes to West Lake,
    Will definitely be stronger than West Lake in the future!"

    In fact, as a scenic spot, East Lake is already a very beautiful place. There, flowers bloom all seasons, there is lake water that is several times wider and clearer and more lovely than West Lake, and there are orchards and dense trees. Sanatoriums, guesthouses, tea pavilions, Qu Yuan Memorial Hall, Xingyin Pavilion, museums... have been built among the mountains and forests.

    When you are intoxicated by East Lake, you will involuntarily enter the embrace of East Lake, you will definitely be happy and forget to return. You live in the guesthouse, listening to the sound of the breeze blowing the lake water, the sound of swimming fish jumping, you will feel: "Happy are the fish!" You will listen more carefully to their movements. At some point, a melodious music sound will fly into your ears from the long sky, this is the university on the south side of the lake broadcasting music.

    You raise your head with the sound and see thousands of lights on the opposite bank, filling the hillside, connecting with the stars in the sky, difficult to distinguish from each other.
      "What is that place?"
    Someone will tell you: "That is Wuhan University."

    Wuhan University is built on Luojia Mountain, is a famous comprehensive university in the country. The whole school is surrounded by water on two sides, the hinterland is a mountain, and there are some hills and fertile soil under the mountain. When you know the beauty of this place of learning, you will think to yourself: "If I could be a college student, I would definitely enter Wuhan University." In fact, there are many universities and colleges near the south side of East Lake. The nationally famous industrial college, built after liberation, the surveying and mapping college known as "the eyes of the country," etc., are all on the south side of East Lake. If you want to study in this beautiful scenic area, there are many universities you can attend!

    The night is slowly deepening, and the starlight is coming brighter.

    Suddenly, on the horizon in the northeast corner of East Lake, a red light sprayed up, the red light rushed into the sky, and then slowly unfolded and fell, resembling the image of the aurora. However, it is impossible for the aurora to appear here, so where did this "aurora" come from?

    That is the blast furnace of "Wugang" (Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation) tapping iron.

    Three years ago, the location of "Wugang"—Gushan, was still a hilly area covered with weeds. Now, a modern steel plant is being built, and some parts have already been completed. Two blast furnaces and three coke ovens have already been completed. Finally, four blast furnaces, five open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, etc. will be built there. If you are a layman, you may not find it surprising when you hear the number of four blast furnaces and five open-hearth furnaces. In fact, it is by relying on them that the country will be supplied with 3.5 million tons of steel per year. The arrival of this day is not far away.

    The construction of Wugang, like the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, has yielded two fruits: one is the completion of the building, and the other is the construction of a new professional engineering team. China has trained a team capable of mastering modern bridge engineering technology in the construction of the first Yangtze River Bridge, including a group of technicians, skilled workers, and a group of construction organizers. This team has been distributed to the Yellow River Iron Bridge, Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, Jiangxi's Ganjiang River Bridge, and other bridge projects across the country.

    "Wugang" has already seen the emergence of a team for the construction of modern metallurgical engineering. They have mastered the complete set of technologies for building modern blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, coke ovens, refractory material factories, sintering plants, and mining engineering, and are improving it day by day.

    When building No. 1 blast furnace, welding the furnace shell required forty-eight senior welders, and with the greatest effort, only nine were found. Is this welding project not going to be done! The leaders and workers conducted research and made a decision:

    "Actively train, ensure the task, ensure the quality."

    Sure enough, sixteen new senior welders were trained in less than half a month, and thirty-odd were trained after a period of time. The welding task was completed ahead of schedule, and after instrument inspection, the quality was "excellent."

    If you ask: How is Wugang being built? It is being built like this: "Learn while building, learn after building."

    The first night, you saw the red light of tapping iron and heard the introduction to Wugang. The next morning, you will definitely find a suitable place to watch Wugang.

    Someone will definitely lead you to Xingyin Pavilion. There is no need to introduce Xingyin Pavilion. Looking at the statue of Qu Yuan, you will know: this name comes from the saying "wandering and chanting on the banks of the river."

    Climbing Xingyin Pavilion, the entire East Lake falls under your feet. In the morning, the water surface is as smooth as a mirror, and the water is emerald green. The first sun shines on the water, and the silver light is like brocade. Rows of fishing boats are already active in the heart of the lake. Frightened wild ducks are wandering far away in the water. Groups of fish float to the surface of the water, welcoming the morning sun. Your eyes are attracted by the scenery in the water, you stare at it. You will see: swimming fish passing through the white clouds, wild cranes flying at the bottom of the water. You look at the mountains on the opposite side of the lake, that is Moshan, the place where Liu Bei offered sacrifices to the heavens, now it is a sanatorium and botanical garden. Looking northeast from Moshan, you will see Wugang and its nearby Gushan Thermal Power Plant. After appreciating it, you will look southeast of Wugang. You will see two particularly tall chimneys, vaguely seeing some buildings.
      "Is this also Wugang?"
    No, that is the country's first forging and casting center factory, which is under construction. A 2,000-ton hydraulic press will be installed and put into production this year. After this factory is completed, it will supply large castings and forgings to various motor factories, shipyards, and heavy machinery factories.

    Looking west from Xingyin Pavilion, crossing a belt of jungle, a behemoth appears, the buildings stand tall and majestic, and the chimneys soar high. This is the Heavy Machine Tool Factory, a newly built factory for manufacturing mother machines.

    Coming down from Xingyin Pavilion, strolling under the shade of the trees, a thought will definitely float in your mind: "What kind of city is Wuhan after all?"

    You can ask the people in the guesthouse, the people in the guesthouse often do not answer you directly, saying:
  "Take another look!" Maybe after breakfast, they will take you on a road in a car, take you to Luojia Mountain Road, where there is Wuhan Boiler Factory, take you to Guanshan, which is a new industrial area built in six months in 1958, where there are Blower Factory, Integrated Motor Factory, Steam Turbine Factory, Bearing Manufacturing Factory. Take you to Ge 店, where it is a chemical industry zone, and then take you to the Second Main Road from Wuhan to Gushan, where you will see the Second National Cotton Factory and Textile Machinery Factory under construction. When you arrive in Hanyang, you have no way to find the old Hanyang, a new mechanical factory is being built. You are tired, stand on the Yangtze River Bridge and rest. To the west is Moon Lake, and on the edge of Moon Lake is the Ancient Qin Terrace—said to be the place where Yu Boya played the qin. Downstream of the bridge, at the foot of Turtle Mountain, is the Qingchuan Pavilion, "Qingchuan distinct Hanyang trees." "Fragrant grass luxuriant Parrot Isle" is not far upstream of the Yangtze River Bridge. Looking downstream along the Yangtze River, there is a tall building on the left bank, very much like a large Western building. You will wonder: "Who would build an office building there?" Yes, that is not an office building, that is a meat joint processing plant, a modern slaughterhouse.

    You originally wanted to rest for a while, but your mind is pursuing the answer to that question: "What kind of city is Wuhan after all?"

    The Wuhan Customs House clock rang, the sound was majestic and melodious, it made you clear-headed, it seemed to answer this question:

    "Wuhan is not only a sacred place of revolution and a transportation center, but has also become a powerful industrial base of socialist New China."

    工业区·风景区——武汉
    李尔重
    武汉关的钟楼，耸入云表，庄严、雄伟、公正地站立在大江之阳。它一丝不苟地催促着武汉的时间前进，它一丝不苟地记载着武汉的时间，它是武汉近代史的见证。
    它的声音洪亮悠扬，它的声音永远充满着唤人的力量。
    1923年2月7日，它的声音多么坚强、悲壮、顽强！它的声音和中国工人阶级的英雄吼声和行动伴和着。大家都知道，施洋、林祥谦的英雄的光辉，振奋了全国劳动人民，他们的鲜血洒在这里，浇灌了武汉的革命幼芽，培养了全国的革命之花。这个英雄的革命传统，在大革命时代、在土地革命时代、在抗日战争时代、在解放战争时代，一直地在武汉工人、武汉劳动人民中发扬着，开出无数的革命之花，结出了无数的革命之果。
    施洋烈士被埋在洪山脚下，一堆乱坟之中，坟前不知是何人给他立了一个碑，上写着“施洋烈士之墓”。坟土成台，野草青青。过去，每年2月7日或5月1日，这个坟上便摆上鲜花，摆出供果，可是谁也不知道这是谁来摆的？何时摆上的？反动派们心里明白，这就叫“施洋的精神不死”，反动派不甘心，便千方百计寻找这伙献花的人，可是也和他们想消灭整个革命力量一样，枉费了心机。
    1949年解放前夕，反动派在洪山一带开辟公路，公路正指向施洋之墓。反动派每走一步，都要向群众敲诈，这是经常的事情，这个事也不例外。反动派面对着一群乱坟便打了主意，他们大肆叫嚣，说是
  “一天之内，把坟一律搬走，不搬者一律平掉”。好些坟主来不及将坟搬掉，只好向反动派纳款求情，反动派很看中了施洋这个坟，以为可以从它身上捞一笔的，可是，完全出乎反动派的意料之外，一夜之内，施洋的坟和碑一起被移到离公路线几十米以外的地方了。
    现在，施洋的坟已移在洪山之腰，纪念碑高高立起，远对着武汉关的钟楼。
    施洋、林祥谦永远活在劳动人民的心里。在1954年与特大洪水斗争中，出现了坚决牺牲自己，保卫城市安全的英雄严忠良、贾名武等；1959年出现冒着生命危险、抢救机器与同志的韩文弟，出现了十三岁少年吕锡三为抢救落水小孩而牺牲自己的英雄事迹。这一切，不论在革命时期、建设时期都继续着。
    武汉关的钟声响着。它是武汉近代史的见证人：武汉，是中国革命圣地之一。
    从施洋墓南行，便是宝通禅寺，进寺内，上山，树木成荫，芳草铺地。到洪山峰顶，便是洪山宝塔所在，唐朝尉迟敬德封楚王，建此塔，上塔，可以纵览三镇。汉水如带，中分汉阳、汉口，长江平铺白练，浩荡长流，京广铁路纵穿三镇，水上布满轮船、帆船，陆上遍驰火车、汽车。长江两岸，布满了码头。看了这些，人们马上会想起一个各处传颂的概念“九省通衢”。
    武汉关钟楼的身旁，有一个高大的建筑物，那是日本帝国主义的日清公司，日清公司往下，就是英帝国主义的太古码头，总之，从武汉关往下游走，在汉口布满了英法俄德日等帝国主义的租界地——当然，这些都成为历史的陈迹了。
    反动派统治时期的“九省通衢”，也就是把中国中南地带的原料集中到武汉加工整理，由各帝国主义拿走；各帝国主义把商品运到武汉行销各地。这个“九省通衢”是帝国主义进行侵略的中心。
    革命胜利了，武汉成了人民的
  “九省通衢”，这里已经建设了和正在建设着新的码头和列车编组站，逐渐增加着机械化的装卸设备，这个“九省通衢”的城市，日益起着巨大的作用。
    想到这里，你自然会注意到全国闻名的长江大桥。
    长江大桥的建成，是由于党的领导、中国工人的创造性的劳动、苏联的帮助、全国的支援，它是中国人民的创造，中苏友谊的结晶。长江大桥有多么重要呢？只要你闭上眼睛想一想：一吨货物运到汉口，下火车，又装到船上，再从船上卸下，运到武昌火车站，再装上火车，运往南方，这该花多少劳动力，增加多少困难，而现在呢，可以毫不费力地通过了；再想一想，每天要有上万的旅客，从南往北，从北往南，要是中间经过一次船渡，该费多少时间，而现在，可以不知不觉地通过了。这些，我想不必多说了，每个中国人都会了解的。
    长江大桥的修建，在1955年9月开工了，采用了世界上建桥工程中最先进的技术——管柱钻孔法。才一开始，工人们对于许多机器操作不熟，大型管柱也做不好，可是他们发挥了中国工人阶级固有的坚韧顽强精神，他们说：
      “只要世界上有的，没有学不会的”。
    “长江大桥一定要用我们的双手建成！”
    1957年的7月，大桥已经基本上建成了，只是桥面工程和桥两头的马路还没有完工。有一位西方人来到了这里，我们向他介绍，说是10月15日要通车。他把肩膀一耸，头一歪，说道：
    “再有半年要能通车，我也佩服你们！”
    1957年10月15日，长江大桥的铁路、公路同时通车了。
    长江大桥的出现，显示了我们中国工人阶级的无限创造力量，显示了中苏友谊的强大力量，显示了社会主义的优越性，也标志着旧社会的必然死亡。
    长江大桥的出现，使武汉三镇成为一个为社会主义事业贡献日大的交通中心。
    在洪山宝塔上，你的全神正贯注到长江大桥上的时候，偶然把脸向右方一转，马上会被一个美丽的湖面给吸引住。
    你要是到过西湖，并且注意过古人对西湖的赞美时，你一定记得苏东坡和白居易的诗。他们用许多好的形容词献给西湖，这是因为他们没有见过东湖，东湖之被人重视并给以装饰，乃是革命胜利以后的事。李白到过武汉若干次，杜甫、崔灏、陆游等诗人都到过，只是他们未到东湖游玩过，也就没给她留下一首赞美诗。幸好朱德同志给它做了一个恰当的评价：
    “东湖暂让西湖好，
    将来定比西湖强！”
    其实，做为一个风景区来说，东湖已经是十分幽美的地方了。在那里，四季开不断的鲜花，有着比西湖广阔数倍、澄洁可爱的湖水，有着果园和茂密的树木；在山林掩映之中，修建了疗养院、客舍、茶亭、屈原馆、行吟阁、博物馆……。
    当你被东湖陶醉了的时候，你不由自主地便会进入东湖的怀抱，你一定会乐而忘返。你住在客舍里，听着微风拂动湖水的声音，游鱼跃动的声音，你会感到：“乐哉鱼乎”！你便会更仔细地听着它们的动作，不定什么时候，一支悠扬的音乐声，会从长空飞进你的耳朵，这是湖南边的学府在广播音乐。
    你随着声音抬起头来，看到对岸灯光万朵，排满山坡，与天空的星宿相接，难分彼此。
      “那是什么地方？”
    有人会告诉你：“那是武汉大学。”
    武汉大学建设在珞珈山上，是全国有名的综合性大学。全校两面临水，腹地是山，山下一些丘陵沃土。当你知道这个学习场所的美丽时，你会想到自己：“假若我能当大学生，我一定入武汉大学。”其实，临在东湖南边一带，还有许多大学和学院。全国有名的、解放后兴建的工业学院，被称作“全国的眼睛”的测量制图学院等等，都在东湖的南边。你要想在这美好的风景区里读书，有好多大学可以上呢！
    夜慢慢地深了，星光来得更亮。
    忽然，在东湖的东北角上的地平线上，喷起了一片红光，红光冲上天，又慢慢地展开、落下，和极光的形像相仿佛。可是，这里是不可能出现极光的，那么，这“极光”是从那儿来的呢？
    那是“武钢”的高炉在出铁。
    三年前，“武钢”所在地——古山，还是一片荒草盖满的丘陵，现在正在兴建着一座现代化的钢铁厂，部分已经建成了。已经建成了两座高炉，三座焦炉。最后，那里要建设出四座高炉，五座平炉，轧钢场等等。你要是一个外行，一听四座高炉、五座平炉的数，会觉着不足为奇的。实际上，就是靠它们一年要供给国家三百五十万吨钢。这个日子的到来，已经为期不远了。
    建设武钢也和建设长江大桥一样，结出两个果子：一个是建成了建筑物，一个是建成一支新的专业工程队伍。中国已经在修建第一座长江大桥中训练出一支能够掌握现代桥梁工程技术的队伍，其中有一批技术人员、技工，也有一批施工组织者。这支队伍，已经分布在黄河铁桥、重庆长江大桥、江西的赣江大桥等全国各地桥梁工程上了。
    “武钢”，这里已经出现了一支建设现代冶金工程的队伍。他们掌握了建设现代化高炉、平炉、焦炉、耐火材料厂、烧结厂和采矿工程的全套技术，使它一天天提高。
    兴建一号高炉时，焊接炉壳，需要四十八个高级电焊工，尽了最大的努力，才找到了九个。难道这个焊接工程不干了么！领导与工人们进行了研究。做出了决定：
    “积极训练，保证任务，保证质量”。
    果然，没有用上半个月便培养出十六个新的高级电焊工，又用了一段时间，培养出三十几个。提前完成焊接任务，经过仪器检验，质量“优等”。
    你要问：武钢在怎样建设着？就是这样地建设着：“边建边学，建成学会。”
    头一天晚上，你看了出铁的红光，并且听了对武钢的介绍，第二天早上一起来，你一定会找个合适的地方去观看武钢。
    一定会有人把你引到行吟阁上。行吟阁无须介绍，一看屈原的塑像，你就知道：这个名字来自“行吟泽畔”之说了。
    登上行吟阁，东湖全部落在脚下，早上水平如镜，水色碧绿。初阳泛水，银光如锦。一排排的渔船，已在湖心活动，惊走的野鸭，往水的远处游荡着，一群群的鱼，浮到水面，迎接着早上的太阳。你的眼睛，被这水里的景致吸住了，你注视着。你会看到：游鱼在白云里穿走，野鹤在水底里飞翔。你望见了湖对面的山，那是磨山，刘备祭天之处，现在是疗养院，植物园。由磨山再往东北看，你便看见了武钢和它近旁的古山热电站。欣赏之余，你会往武钢的东南方看。你将看到两根特别高的烟囱，隐约地看到一些建筑物。
      “这也是武钢么？”
    不是，那是全国第一座锻铸中心厂，正在兴建。一台二千吨的水压机，今年将装起并投入生产。这个厂子建成之后，将供应各电机工厂、造船厂、重型机械厂以大型铸件、锻件。
    从行吟阁西望，越过一带丛林，出现一个庞然大物，建筑物巍峨矗立，烟囱高耸。这是重型机床厂，新建成的制造工作母机的工厂。
    从行吟阁下来，在树荫下漫步，你的脑子一定会浮起一个念头：“武汉到底是个什么城市呢？”
    你可以问一下客舍的人，客舍的人往往不正面答复你，说一句：
  “您再看一看吧！”也许吃过早饭，他们会用一部汽车把你送上马路，把你送到珞珈山路，那里有武汉锅炉厂，送到关山，那是1958年用了六个月时间建筑出来的一个新工业区，那里有鼓风机厂、综合电机厂、汽轮机厂、轴承制造厂。把你再送到葛店，那里是一个化学工业区，再把你送到武汉到古山的二干道上，你会看到正在兴建的国棉二厂、纺织机械厂；到了汉阳，你没有办法再找到旧汉阳了，一片新的机械工厂兴建起来。你疲倦了，站在长江大桥上休息一下，西边有月湖，月湖边上有古琴台——据说是俞伯牙鼓琴之处。大桥的下游、龟山脚下，就是“晴川历历汉阳树”的晴川阁。“芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲”，就在长江大桥的上游不远之处。顺着长江往下游望，左岸有一个高大建筑物，很像一座大洋楼。你会奇怪：“什么人会在那里盖一座办公楼呢？”是的，那不是办公楼，那是肉类联合加工厂，一座现代化的屠宰工厂。
    你本来是想休息一下子，可是你的脑子在追求着那个问题的答案：“武汉到底是个什么城市？”
    武汉关的钟声响了，声音雄壮而悠扬，它使你心神清醒，它好像解答了这个问题：
    “武汉不单是革命圣地，交通中心，而且已经成为社会主义新中国的一个强大工业基地”。
