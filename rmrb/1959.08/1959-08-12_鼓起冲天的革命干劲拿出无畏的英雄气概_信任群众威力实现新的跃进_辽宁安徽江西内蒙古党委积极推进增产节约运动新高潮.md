    Party Committees of Liaoning, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Inner Mongolia Actively Promote a New Upsurge in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement

    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 11th dispatch) The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee from August 3rd to 5th to discuss current industrial and agricultural production issues and decided to seize August and September to comprehensively launch a new upsurge in the mass increase production and practice economy movement. On the afternoon of the 10th, the Provincial Party Committee held a broadcast conference attended by five million workers, farmers, shop employees, teachers, office cadres, and soldiers across the province. At the meeting, people from all walks of life resolutely assured the Party that they would use outstanding achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.
    From January to July this year, industrial production in Liaoning Province increased greatly compared to the same period last year. The total industrial output value increased by 49.3%. Steel increased by 49% compared to the same period last year; iron increased by 31.2%, steel products increased by 39.9%; coal increased by 46.7%; railway freight volume increased by 35.79%; and highway freight volume increased by 20.8%. On the agricultural front, summer crops have achieved a bumper harvest, and autumn crops are growing well.
    With the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses is increasing day by day, which is the mainstream of the province's production and construction process. However, on the other hand, a right-leaning, slackening mood has emerged among a small number of cadres, who are afraid of difficulties, lack drive, and do not believe in the enormous power of the masses' initiative and creativity, resulting in a decline in the production level of their units. The provincial and municipal Party committees criticized this right-leaning, slackening mood, leading to the March coal battle and a new upsurge in production on the entire economic front. However, from May onwards, in the process of discussing production plans, right-leaning sentiments gradually resurfaced. The Provincial Party Committee again convened an industrial conference at the end of June and issued an emergency instruction on July 14 to criticize right-leaning sentiments, and the situation improved again, with all production continuing to rise. In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's national plan, the Provincial Party Committee recently convened another industrial production conference. At the meeting, steel enterprises across the province guaranteed to increase the production level of steel and steel products in the third quarter by about 10% on the basis of the second quarter, and coal mines across the province guaranteed to produce an additional two million tons of coal in addition to completing this year's national plan.
    More than half a year of experience has proven that: when right-leaning and slackening sentiments rise, production declines; when right-leaning sentiments are overcome and revolutionary enthusiasm is boosted, production rises. Therefore, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee requires Party organizations at all levels to immediately mobilize the masses, continue to examine and overcome right-leaning sentiments, and, on the basis of seeking truth from facts and achieving consensus, boost enthusiasm and comprehensively launch a new upsurge in the mass increase production and practice economy movement.

    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 11th dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting of its Standing Committee, calling on the people of the province to continue to boost their enthusiasm, vigorously increase production and practice economy, resolutely overcome drought, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's plans in industry, agriculture, finance, and trade. In recent days, the Provincial Party Committee has also held telephone conferences for secretaries of prefectural and municipal Party committees, and jointly with the Provincial People's Committee, held a province-wide broadcast conference to make specific arrangements and extensive mobilization.
    Since July this year, Anhui Province has achieved great achievements on all fronts. In terms of industry, the total industrial output value in the first half of the year doubled compared to the same period last year; the output of major industrial products, such as steel, increased by 29.6 times, pig iron increased by 5.1 times, and raw coal increased by 94.9%. In agriculture, after achieving a great summer harvest, another great harvest of early rice was achieved, and intermediate rice and other autumn crops are also growing well. Finance and trade work has also made great achievements in procurement and supply.
    The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that while the vast number of cadres and masses in the province have made great achievements, a few people, in the course of the leap forward, have encountered some temporary difficulties and developed right-leaning, fear-of-difficulty sentiments, relaxing their due efforts. The Provincial Party Committee called on all localities to quickly overcome this harmful sentiment, study the relevant editorials in the People's Daily, recognize the favorable situation, boost enthusiasm, and continue to leap forward. On the industrial front, it is necessary to bring out the energy of last year's large-scale iron and steel production to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of various production tasks; on the agricultural production front, it is necessary to bring out the energy of last year's major battle against drought to overcome the current drought and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest; at the same time, it is necessary to actively take various measures to make up for the losses caused by the disaster and ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production tasks. Finance and trade and transportation departments should also greatly strengthen their work and launch a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy.

    (Our newspaper, Nanchang, 11th dispatch) "Oppose right-leaning sentiments, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, resolutely implement the Party's general line, and quickly launch a new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward," this is the fighting call issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the 20 million people of the province. In order to quickly launch a new upsurge of continued leap forward, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee has held meetings for several days, summarizing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in the first half of the year, analyzing the current favorable situation, and specifically deploying the combat tasks for August and September.
    The Standing Committee meeting pointed out: In the first half of 1959, all aspects of the province's national economy continued to leap forward, and the people's communes were further consolidated. The achievements are great, and the future is bright. But at the same time, a right-leaning sentiment has emerged among some cadres, who lack drive, ignore achievements, exaggerate difficulties, and fail to see the favorable conditions in all aspects. The meeting believes that this is the main danger at present and must be resolutely opposed and resolutely overcome.
    In order to seize the opportunity and quickly launch a new upsurge of leap forward, the Standing Committee meeting, after research, put forward the current combat tasks on all fronts such as industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation. On the agricultural front, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to complete the summer harvesting and planting tasks, expand the autumn field area as much as possible, strengthen autumn field management, do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, pest control and extermination, resolutely overcome natural disasters, and strive for a bumper harvest of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries throughout the year. On the industrial front, it is necessary to seize the production of steel, coal, machinery, timber, and other heavy industrial products, and actively restore and increase the production of light industrial and handicraft products necessary for the people's daily life. In terms of market work, it is necessary to seize the procurement of agricultural products and other commodities and do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods, handicraft products, and light industrial products. The Standing Committee pointed out that in order to complete various tasks, all aspects of the national economy must strengthen cooperation.
    The Standing Committee called on Party organizations at all levels to widely and deeply carry out education on the issue of the situation, so that all cadres and the broad masses can correctly understand the current situation, resolutely oppose right-leaning, slackening sentiments, boost greater enthusiasm, and launch a new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward on all fronts.

    (Our newspaper, Hohhot, 11th dispatch) The Inner Mongolia Party Committee held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee, requiring Party organizations at all levels to boost their enthusiasm and launch a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on the 9th to discuss the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments and Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" and the current economic situation in the autonomous region. The meeting believes that the current economic situation in the autonomous region is very good, and great achievements have been made in increasing production and practicing economy. This year, industrial production and capital construction have completed about 50% of the plan. More than 8.4 million mu of spring wheat have achieved a bumper harvest; more than 68 million mu of autumn crops are growing well.
    The meeting pointed out that at present, we must not be satisfied with past achievements, and we must see that in order to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the 1959 industrial and agricultural production and various construction tasks, we must boost our enthusiasm and continue to make arduous efforts. However, a small number of people have right-leaning, slackening sentiments, and they hold negative emotions towards some difficulties in production and construction and do not take active measures. Therefore, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee requires Party organizations at all levels to focus on August and September, boost their enthusiasm, launch a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, complete steel, coal, and other plans in terms of quality, quantity, and on time, vigorously increase timber production, ensure that 1,615,000 cubic meters of timber are transferred out this year to support various parts of the country, and strengthen field management of autumn crops.
    The meeting also required Party committees at all levels to mobilize the vast number of workers and cadres of all ethnic groups to vigorously increase the production of daily necessities and handicraft products, carry out a procurement campaign for spring wheat, livestock, and other agricultural, animal husbandry, sideline, and local specialty products, further arrange the market, and better meet the needs of production and life of people of all ethnic groups.
    The meeting required Party committees at all levels to immediately study the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments and Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," and, in conjunction with checking current work, criticize all ideas that hinder increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to comprehensively complete various national economic plans.

　　鼓起冲天的革命干劲拿出无畏的英雄气概
　　信任群众威力实现新的跃进
　　辽宁安徽江西内蒙古党委积极推进增产节约运动新高潮
    本报沈阳11日电　中共辽宁省委于8月3日至5日召开常委扩大会议，讨论当前工农业生产问题，决定抓紧8、9两月，全面地掀起群众性的增产节约运动新高潮。10日下午，省委召开了有全省五百万工人、农民、店员、教职员工、机关干部和部队战士收听的广播大会。会上，各界人民向党坚决保证要用优异的成绩迎接国庆十周年。
    今年1至7月份，辽宁省工业生产比去年同期有极大增长。工业总产值增长49.3％。钢比去年同期增长49％；铁增长31.2％，钢材增长39.9％；煤炭增长46.7％；铁路货运量增长35.79％；公路货运量增长20.8％。在农业战线上，夏季作物已获丰收，大秋作物生长良好。
    随着工农业生产的继续跃进，广大干部和群众的干劲日益高涨，这是全省生产建设进程中的主流。但是，另一方面，在一小部分干部中，右倾松劲情绪有所抬头，害怕困难，缺乏干劲，不相信群众积极性创造性的巨大威力，因而造成他们所在单位的生产水平的下降。省、市委对这种右倾松劲情绪进行了批判，于是出现了3月夺煤大战及整个经济战线上的生产新高潮。但从5月开始在讨论生产计划的过程中，右倾情绪逐渐地又抬了头。省委又在6月底召开了工业会议，7月14日发出了紧急指示，批判右倾情绪，局面又有好转，各项生产都继续上升。为了保证完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，省委近日又召开了工业生产会议。会上，全省钢铁企业保证把第三季度的钢铁和钢材的生产水平在第二季度的基础上提高10％左右，全省煤矿保证完成今年国家计划外，再增产煤炭两百万吨。
    半年多来的经验证明了：右倾松劲情绪抬头，生产就要下降；克服了右倾情绪，鼓足了革命干劲，生产就会上升。因此，辽宁省委要求各级党的组织立即发动群众，继续对右倾情绪加以检查和克服，使干部和群众在实事求是和认识一致的基础上，鼓足干劲，全面地掀起群众性的增产节约运动新高潮。
    本报合肥11日电　中共安徽省委最近举行常委会议，号召全省人民继续鼓足干劲，厉行增产节约，坚决战胜干旱，为工、农、财贸各方面完成和超额完成今年计划而奋斗。连日来，省委还召开了地市委书记电话会议，和省人委共同举行了全省广播大会，进行了具体安排和广泛动员。
    今年7月以来，安徽省各个战线都取得了很大成就。在工业方面，上半年工业生产总产值比去年同期增长一倍；主要工业产品产量，如钢增长二十九点六倍，生铁增长五点一倍，原煤增长94.9％。在农业方面，取得夏季大丰收之后，又取得了早稻大丰收，中稻和其他秋作物也生长良好。财贸工作在收购和供应方面也有很大的成绩。
    省委指出，在全省广大干部和群众取得巨大成就的同时，少数人在跃进中，遇到了一些暂时的困难，产生了右倾畏难情绪，放松了应有的努力。省委号召各地迅速克服这种有害情绪，学习人民日报的有关社论，认清有利形势，鼓足干劲，继续跃进。在工业战线上要拿出去年大办钢铁的劲头，来保证完成和超额完成各项生产任务；在农业生产战线上要拿出去年大战干旱的劲头，战胜当前干旱，争取全面丰收；同时要积极采取各种措施，来弥补受灾的损失，保证完成今年农业生产任务。财贸、运输部门也要大大加强自己的工作，掀起增产节约新高潮。
    本报南昌11日电　“反右倾情绪，鼓革命干劲，坚决贯彻党的总路线，迅速掀起大跃进的新高潮”，这是中共江西省委向全省二千万人民发出的战斗号召。为了迅速地掀起继续跃进的新高潮，省委常委会连日召开会议，总结了上半年大跃进的成绩，分析了当前的有利形势，具体布置了8、9两月的战斗任务。
    常委会议指出：1959年上半年，全省国民经济的各个方面都在继续向前跃进，人民公社得到了进一步的巩固。成绩是伟大的，前途是一片光明。但与此同时，在一部分干部中却出现了一种右倾情绪，他们干劲不足，忽视成绩，夸大困难，看不到各方面的有利条件。会议认为这是当前的主要危险，必须坚决反对，坚决克服。
    为了抓紧时机、迅速掀起新的跃进高潮，常委会议经过研究提出了当前工农业、商业及交通运输业等各条战线上的战斗任务。在农业战线上，必须抓紧时机完成夏收夏种任务，尽可能地扩大秋田面积，加强秋季田间管理，做好防旱抗旱防虫灭虫工作，坚决战胜自然灾害，力争全年农林牧副渔大丰收。在工业战线上，必须抓紧钢铁、煤炭、机械、木材和其他重工业品的生产，积极恢复和增产人民日用必需的轻工业和手工业产品。在市场工作方面，必须抓紧做好农产品和其他商品的收购工作，做好副食品、手工业品、轻工业品的供应工作。常委会指出：要完成各项任务，国民经济的各个方面，必须加强协作。
    常委会号召各级党组织广泛、深入地开展关于形势问题的教育，使全体干部和广大群众正确认识当前的形势，坚决反对右倾松劲情绪，鼓足更大干劲，在各个战线上掀起一个大跃进的新高潮。
    本报呼和浩特11日电　内蒙古党委举行常委扩大会议，要求各级党组织鼓足干劲，掀起增产节约的新高潮。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会9日召开常委扩大会议，讨论了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论和自治区当前的经济形势。会议认为自治区目前经济形势很好，增产节约获得很大成绩。今年工业生产、基本建设已完成计划的50％左右。八百四十多万亩春小麦已获丰收；六千八百多万亩大秋作物生长良好。
    会议指出：目前绝不能满足过去的成就，必须看到要全面地完成和超额完成1959年工农业生产和各项建设任务，必须鼓足干劲，继续进行艰苦的努力。但是有一少部分人，却存在着右倾松劲情绪，他们对生产建设中的一些困难抱着消极情绪，不采取积极措施。因此，内蒙古党委要求各级党组织大抓8、9两个月，鼓足干劲，掀起增产节约的新高潮，按质按量按时完成钢铁、煤炭等计划，大力增产木材，保证今年下半年调出一百六十一万五千立方米木材支援全国各地，并且加强大秋作物的田间管理。
    会议还要求各级党委动员广大职工和各族干部大力增产日用百货、手工业产品，开展春小麦、牲畜等农、牧、副和土特产品收购运动，进一步安排好市场，更好地供应各族人民生产生活的需要。
    会议要求各级党委立即学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，结合检查当前工作，批判各种妨碍增产节约的思想，争取全面地完成各项国民经济计划。
