Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 18th: Romania, where 95% of its machinery and equipment relied on imports before liberation, is now not only able to basically meet domestic needs for machinery and equipment with the products of its own machine manufacturing industry, but is also exporting products from this industrial sector to twenty-three countries around the world. Due to the rapid development of the machine manufacturing industry, Romania now produces as much machinery and equipment in forty-two days as it did in the entire year of 1938.

Romania's machine manufacturing industry was basically established during the era of the people's government. In the past ten years, the country has vigorously developed the foundation of the machine manufacturing industry—the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products—and has built and expanded fifty-eight machine manufacturing plants. Due to the Party and government's special attention to the development of this industrial sector, by 1957, Romania's domestically produced machinery and equipment had largely met domestic needs. Currently, domestically manufactured machinery and equipment account for more than four-fifths of the machinery and equipment used in various industrial sectors nationwide.

The machine manufacturing industry is one of the fastest-growing industrial sectors in Romania. According to statistical materials, during the seven years from 1951 to 1957, the growth rate of machine manufacturing industry production was twice as fast as the growth rate of the entire industry during the same period, and output also doubled. In 1958, the production of the machine manufacturing industry increased approximately seven and a half times compared to 1938. Thus, the machine manufacturing industry has developed into an extremely important sector in Romania's national economy. Currently, its output has reached more than one-fifth of the total industrial output, and its products have increased to more than 1,100 types, including various machine tools, petroleum and chemical industry equipment, wood processing industry equipment, locomotives, automobiles, ships, cement plant equipment, power generation equipment, agricultural machinery, and machinery used in light industry, etc.

The petroleum machinery manufacturing industry, established during the era of the people's government, now produces various drilling, extraction, and oil processing equipment. It not only fully meets domestic needs but also meets the needs of some other countries. The development of Romania's shipbuilding industry is also very rapid. Before liberation, Romania could only repair ships or manufacture wooden boats. Now, it can manufacture modern passenger ships, barges, tugboats, oil tankers, fishing boats, and ocean-going vessels, and a considerable number are exported abroad. Romania's first 4,500-ton displacement ship manufactured entirely by itself was recently launched, and the design of 10,000-ton ships has now begun.

With the rapid development of the machine manufacturing industry, Romania's export volume of machinery and equipment is also increasing year by year. For example, in 1950, the export volume of machinery accounted for 5.6% of the total export volume of goods, rising to 10.1% in 1957, and this year it will increase to 15%, eighteen times that of 1948.

After liberation, in order to accelerate the development of the machine manufacturing industry, Romania adopted measures to gradually realize the specialization, collaboration, mechanization, and automation of production in this industrial sector. These measures have created conditions for the mass production of large machines and laying the foundation for a modern machine manufacturing industry.

This year, Romania's machine manufacturing industry will achieve further development, and its output will increase by 14% compared to last year. It is estimated that by 1975, the production of Romania's machine manufacturing industry will increase sevenfold compared to this year. (Attached photo)

    罗马尼亚机器制造工业发展迅速
　　过去机器设备几乎全靠进口　现在基本满足需要还能输出
    新华社布加勒斯特18日电　解放前95％的机器设备都是依靠进口的罗马尼亚，现在不仅能够用本国机器制造工业的产品基本上满足国内对机器设备的需要，而且正在向世界上二十三个国家输出这一工业部门的产品。由于机器制造工业的迅速发展，罗马尼亚今年每四十二天生产的机器设备就等于1938年全年的产量。
    罗马尼亚的机器制造工业基本上是在人民政权的年代中建立起来的，最近十年来，国家大力发展了机器制造工业的基础——生铁、钢和钢材的生产，并且新建和扩建了五十八个机器制造厂。由于党和政府特别重视这一工业部门的发展，在1957年，罗马尼亚本国生产的机器设备已经大体上满足了国内的需要，目前，本国制造的机器设备已经占全国各工业部门使用的机器设备的五分之四以上。
    机器制造工业是罗马尼亚发展速度最快的工业部门之一。根据统计材料，在1951年到1957年的七年期间，机器制造工业生产增长的速度比同一时期整个工业的增长速度快一倍，产量也增加了一倍。1958年机器制造工业的生产约增加为1938年的七倍半。这样，机器制造工业已经发展成为罗马尼亚国民经济中的一个极重要的部门，目前，它的产量达到了整个工业产量的五分之一以上，产品已经增加到一千一百多种，其中包括各种机床、石油和化学工业设备、木材加工工业设备、机车、汽车、轮船、水泥厂设备、发电设备、农业机械以及轻工业使用的机器等。
    在人民政权年代中建立起来的石油机器制造业，目前生产着各种钻探、开采和石油加工设备，它不仅能够完全满足国内的需要，而且还能满足其他一些国家的需要。罗马尼亚的造船工业的发展也是十分迅速的。解放前罗马尼亚只能修理船只或制造木船，现在已经能够制造现代化的客轮、驳轮、拖船、油船、渔船和远洋轮船，并且有相当数量是输出国外的。罗马尼亚自己制造的第一艘排水量为四千五百吨的轮船已经在最近下水，目前已开始设计万吨级的轮船。
    随着机器制造工业的迅速发展，罗马尼亚机器设备的输出额也在逐年增加，例如，1950年机器输出额占全部货物输出额的5.6％，1957年上升到10.1％，而今年将增加到15％，为1948年的十八倍。
    解放后，为了加速机器制造工业的发展，罗马尼亚采取了使这一工业部门的生产逐渐实现专业化、协作化、机械化和自动化的措施。这些措施为成批地生产大型机器和奠定现代化机器制造业的基础创造了条件。
    今年，罗马尼亚的机器制造工业将获得进一步的发展，它的产量将比去年增长14％。预计，到1975年，罗马尼亚的机器制造工业的生产将增长为今年的七倍。（附图片）
