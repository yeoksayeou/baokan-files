    Cuban and Venezuelan Foreign Ministers
    Oppose U.S. Suggestions of Infringing on Sovereignty

　　Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 14th - At the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers continuing today, the Foreign Ministers of Cuba and Venezuela expressed firm opposition to the supervisory committee proposed by the United States, which would interfere in the internal affairs of countries in the Caribbean region.

　　At the meeting on the 13th, Herter requested the establishment of a "Special Temporary Committee" to "investigate" the situation in the Caribbean region and "supervise" the implementation of "democracy."

　　Cuban Foreign Minister Roa said that the establishment of such a committee would in itself be an infringement on sovereignty. He believes that the establishment of such a committee is merely a replica of the notorious police action advocated by U.S. Senator Mansfield.

　　Venezuelan Foreign Minister Arcaya believes that the so-called supervisory committee would only protect dictators.

　　In his speech, Arcaya fiercely criticized the remaining dictatorial systems in Latin America.

　　Panamanian Foreign Minister Miguel Moreno, in his speech, condemned the United States for occupying the Panama Canal Zone, forcing Panama to accept meager compensation for the U.S. use of the Canal Zone, and using Canal Zone trade to harm Panamanian national enterprises.

　　The Foreign Ministers of Bolivia, Uruguay, Brazil, Honduras, Haiti, Paraguay, and Nicaragua also spoke at today's meeting.

　　Since the meeting began three days ago, the delegations have put forward twenty-four proposals on various issues discussed at the meeting. The General Affairs Committee has handed these proposals over to several groups for study.

　　Cuba has put forward a proposal on economic underdevelopment and political instability. This proposal suggests that the "Organization of American States" declare that dictatorial systems are the root cause of deep unrest in the Americas, and demands that the people of all countries be able to work peacefully without interference from neighboring countries. The proposal also suggests formulating a cooperation program to combat economic underdevelopment as a guarantee for maintaining democracy and opposing dictatorship.

　　So far, the U.S. delegation has not put forward a formal proposal. However, among the proposals that have already been put forward, some seem inseparable from the intentions of U.S. Secretary of State Herter. In recent days, Herter has been conducting frequent activities outside the meeting. Today, he dined with the Foreign Ministers of Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina to discuss issues related to the meeting. Prior to this, Herter also held "informal" talks with the Foreign Ministers of eight other countries. After Herter met with Colombian Foreign Minister Turbay on the 12th, the Colombian delegation formally suggested establishing a committee like the one Herter proposed on the 13th, but its jurisdiction would cover the entire Western Hemisphere, not just the Caribbean. It is said that this plan has been supported by Herter. Colombia's opinion was put forward after Herter's suggestion was opposed by Cuba and Venezuela.

### 古巴和委内瑞拉外长  反对美国侵犯主权的建议

    古巴和委内瑞拉外长
    反对美国侵犯主权的建议
      据新华社圣地亚哥14日电　在今天继续举行的美洲外长会议上，古巴和委内瑞拉外交部长表示坚决反对美国建议成立的干涉加勒比地区各国内政的监督委员会。
    赫脱在13日的会议上要求成立“特别临时委员会”，以“调查”加勒比地区的局势，“监督”实施“民主”的问题。
    古巴外交部长罗亚说，成立这样一个委员会，它本身就是对主权的侵犯。他认为，成立这种委员会只是美国参议员曼斯菲尔德所宣扬的臭名昭著的警察行动的翻版。
    委内瑞拉外交部长阿卡亚认为，所谓监督委员会只会保护独裁者。
    阿卡亚在发言中猛烈抨击拉丁美洲尚存的独裁制度。
    巴拿马外交部长米格尔·摩伦诺在发言中谴责美国霸占巴拿马运河区，强迫巴拿马接受美国使用运河区付出的低微报酬，并利用运河区贸易损害巴拿马的民族企业。
    在今天会议上发言的还有玻利维亚、乌拉圭、巴西、洪都拉斯、海地、巴拉圭和尼加拉瓜的外交部长。
    会议开始三天以来，各代表团已经提出了二十四项有关会议所讨论的各项问题的提案。总务委员会已经把这些提案交给许多小组去研究。
    古巴提出了一项关于经济不发达和政治不稳定的提案。这项提案建议
  “美洲国家组织”宣布独裁制度是美洲深刻不安的根源，要求让各国人民能进行和平劳动，不受邻国干涉。提案还建议制定一个与经济不发达作斗争的合作纲领，作为维护民主和反对独裁的保障。
    迄今美国代表团没有提出正式的提案。但是在已经提出来的提案中，有一些看来是同美国国务卿赫脱的意图分不开的。这几天来，赫脱在会外进行了频繁的活动。今天他同墨西哥、巴西和阿根廷的外交部长一道进餐，讨论了有关会议的问题。在这以前，赫脱还曾同另外八个国家的外交部长进行了“非正式”会谈。在12日赫脱同哥伦比亚外长图巴伊会谈以后，哥伦比亚代表团已经正式建议成立像赫脱13日提出的那样一种委员会，不过它管辖范围是整个西半球，而不仅限于加勒比海。据说这个计划已得到赫脱支持。哥伦比亚的意见是在赫脱的建议遭到古巴和委内瑞拉反对以后提出的。
