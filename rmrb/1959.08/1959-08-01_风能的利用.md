    Utilization of Wind Energy
    Wu Wen, Power Research Office, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    As early as more than two thousand years ago, our ancestors had already built sailboats to utilize wind power on the Yellow River. Subsequently, they created sail-type wind turbines (i.e., windmills) to use wind energy for drawing water and processing grains, applying wind energy to agricultural production.

      The energy of flowing air on the Earth's surface exceeds the total of usable water energy and the fuel energy extracted annually.

    The potential of usable wind energy worldwide is exceptionally vast. Wind energy comes directly from solar radiation. Of all the solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface, approximately 2% is absorbed by the atmosphere. Thermal expansion and contraction cause all the air on the Earth's surface to flow, which is the source of wind energy. However, the wind energy that people can utilize is only the energy of flowing air within one or two hundred meters of the land surface, estimated to be about 1% to 2% of the total wind energy. Even so, this energy is still extremely large, estimated at around 20 to 30 billion kilowatts, far exceeding the total usable water energy worldwide and the total fuel energy currently extracted annually.

    Besides the vast quantity of wind energy, it also has the advantage of being easy to find. As long as there are meteorological records, suitable wind turbine stations can be determined without the need for exploration, drilling, and other work. As long as there is wind, it can be used at any time without investing in extraction. This is both time-saving and convenient compared to using energy sources such as coal and oil.

    Machines that utilize wind energy are called wind turbines (or windmills). Utilizing wind energy means utilizing the kinetic energy of flowing air. When wind flows through a wind turbine, the wind speed decreases, which means the wind's kinetic energy decreases. This reduced kinetic energy is absorbed by the wind turbine. Theoretically, the maximum energy that can be absorbed by a wind turbine is 0.593 of the total wind kinetic energy; this value is called the maximum wind energy utilization coefficient. In practice, the wind energy utilization coefficient of wind turbines is less than 0.593.

    The magnitude of wind's kinetic energy is directly proportional to the cube of wind speed, so when wind speed increases, wind's kinetic energy increases particularly quickly. Gale-force winds of level nine (wind speed of about twenty meters per second) or higher have destructive power. Wind turbines generally operate within a wind speed range of level three to seven (approximately three to fourteen meters per second). In the event of a gale, they must stop running, otherwise, they will be damaged.

    Many areas in our country can use wind turbines. In areas with higher wind speeds, large-capacity wind turbines of one hundred kilowatts or more can be built. Wind turbines can drive waterwheels for irrigation and drainage, drive grinders for processing grains, or drive generators to produce electricity. These types of machines require relatively little energy, generally between one and ten kilowatts, which wind turbines can easily meet, so they are most suitable for rural areas. In some areas of our Inner Mongolia grasslands, Northwest plains and mountainous regions, and Xinjiang, it is often impossible to establish hydroelectric or thermal power plants due to a lack of water and coal, which affects land reclamation and agricultural production. These areas generally have wind all year round, and if wind turbines are used, it would be most ideal. In addition, in coastal areas and throughout the country, wind power is generally uniformly distributed, and wind turbines can be used everywhere. In areas with higher wind speeds, large-capacity wind turbines of one hundred kilowatts or more can also be built to generate electricity and supply the needs of industrial construction. Therefore, the utilization of wind energy is of great significance to national economic construction.

    Currently used wind turbines can be broadly divided into two categories. One type has blade rotation planes that are parallel and consistent with the wind direction, and the rotation axis is mostly vertical, but it can also be horizontal. The other type has blade rotation planes perpendicular to the wind direction, and the rotation axis is always horizontal. When the first type of wind turbine adopts a vertical rotation axis, it can rotate regardless of the direction the wind comes from, which is its advantage. The large windmills with eight to ten cloth sail blades in the style of revolving lanterns created by farmers in the Lixiahe area of Jiangsu Province belong to this category. The disadvantage of this type of wind turbine is its low wind energy utilization coefficient. The ideal maximum value is only 0.333. The actual value is even lower, between 0.08 and 0.16. At the same time, because the linear speed of the rotating blades is always less than the wind speed, the rotation speed of the axis is very low. If it is used to drive a generator, it must have a relatively large speed increasing device. Due to the low energy utilization coefficient, the unit power requires more materials, which increases the cost, and the structure is complex, making it unsuitable for high-speed winds. Therefore, this type of wind turbine is now rarely used and is being phased out. The second type of wind turbine is the type most used by countries around the world. It can be divided into a simple, low-speed type and a modern, high-speed type. The former is suitable for generating small power of five kilowatts or less, and the latter is suitable for generating medium and large power of ten kilowatts or more.

    Low-speed wind turbines generally have four to twenty-four blades. The blade diameter is mostly less than ten meters. The blades can be made of cloth sails or wooden boards. The entire structure, such as the blades, supports, rotation axis, and adjustment device, except for a few metal joints and steel wire ropes in the bearings, can be made of wood and bamboo materials. Therefore, materials can be obtained locally, and the cost is low. At the same time, the manufacturing and use technology requirements are not high, so it has been used relatively early and widely in rural areas of various countries. For example, there are currently more than 30,000 wind turbines of this type in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, each producing an average power of three to five kilowatts. Other parts of the country are also using them in large quantities and are deeply welcomed by the masses. In the mid-18th century, the Netherlands had 7,000 to 8,000 such wind turbines built throughout the country for drainage and irrigation and processing agricultural products, which played a role in promoting the national economic construction of the time. Even today, more than a thousand are still in use. In addition, island countries such as Denmark, Greece, and the United Kingdom have also widely used this simple wind turbine in rural areas for many years. Low-speed wind turbines are better than the first type of wind turbine mentioned above, but they still have shortcomings, such as a low wind energy utilization coefficient, complex structure, not strong, and only suitable for low-speed winds. Therefore, when we need to use high-speed winds to generate large power, we have to use new high-speed wind turbines.

      Many countries are strengthening the research and development of high-speed wind turbines; the total power of various wind turbines worldwide is currently about 550,000 kilowatts.

    High-speed wind turbines are a modern power machine. They generally have two to four blades. The cross-section of each blade is streamlined, similar to the propeller blade cross-section on an airplane. From the root to the tip of the blade, the profile lines at different radii are also different. The selection of these profile lines must be considered and determined based on gas dynamics. The main requirement is that the lift/drag ratio is as large as possible; a large ratio can improve the wind energy utilization coefficient. The use of high-speed wind turbines is only a matter of recent decades, not as early and widespread as the appearance of low-speed wind turbines. But recently, countries have been strengthening research and development. For example, in 1949, the United Kingdom established a 100-kilowatt wind turbine experimental power station on the coast of Scotland, with three blades and hydraulic pitch adjustment speed control, which is still in operation. In 1940, the United States built a 1,250-kilowatt wind turbine power generation experimental station in the northern mountains, with two blades and an all-metal structure. After five years of research, it was concluded that the mechanical structure problems of large-capacity wind turbines could be completely solved; and the power of a more economical power station should be around 2,000 kilowatts. In 1947, West Germany designed a giant 14,000-kilowatt wind turbine power station with a tower height of 250 meters, utilizing the more stable high-altitude airflow, but it has not yet been manufactured. The research and development work of these countries is still in the experimental stage. The Soviet Union is far ahead of other countries in the world in the creation of high-speed modern wind turbines. First, the master of fluid mechanics, Zhukovsky, laid the basic theory of wind turbines and found that the maximum wind energy utilization coefficient was 0.593. In 1923, the Soviet Central Fluid Mechanics Research Institute created new blades, increasing the efficiency of the original wind turbines by two to two and a half times. According to published figures, by 1954, there were nearly 30,000 new wind turbine stations in the Soviet Union, with a total power of about 120,000 kilowatts. The largest generator set was 100 kilowatts. In the future, it is also planned to establish 600,000 30-kilowatt power stations, which will be widely used in state-owned farms and collective farms.

    Our country's research and development of high-speed wind turbines has only started in recent years. But in just a few years, more than a dozen different types of high-speed wind turbines have been made in various places, such as the Yingkou 16.8-meter three-blade machine, the Liaoning live-direction tail vehicle unit, the Jilin Type 57, and the Inner Mongolia 58-7 type. The achievements are great, providing favorable conditions for future promotion and use.

    According to preliminary estimates, the total power of various wind turbines worldwide is currently about 550,000 kilowatts, and its energy is equivalent to an annual output of 500,000 tons of coal. This number is negligible compared with the 20 to 30 billion kilowatts of wind energy resources that can be utilized globally. What is the reason that limits our utilization of this wealth? There are two main obstacles to the large-scale utilization of wind energy. One aspect is that the performance of wind turbines is not perfect and the cost is high. The other aspect is that the wind source is unstable: sometimes there, sometimes not, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, and the wind direction also often changes, causing unstable operation. This is not suitable for driven power machinery and generators that require stable speed. Aiming at these problems, wind turbine workers in various countries are conducting research along different paths. In order to improve the efficiency of wind turbines, it is necessary to conduct theoretical research on the gas dynamics of the blades. In order to enable wind turbines to adapt to the uncertain wind source, it is necessary to provide effective yaw and speed control methods. For low-speed, low-power wind turbines, there are several devices for manual displacement yaw control, tail wing or rotating tail vehicle automatic yaw control, and manual control of cloth sail speed control. For high-speed, high-power wind turbines, mechanical steering speed control, hydraulic variable pitch speed control, centrifugal stable blade speed control, and electric yaw speed control devices all need to be further researched and improved. The latter's adjustment devices should all be highly automated. In order to avoid typhoon attacks, each wind turbine needs to be equipped with automatic safety protection measures to avoid overspeed damage. In order to select the most favorable location to establish a wind turbine station, reliable wind source data over a long period of time is required, and it needs to be sorted and analyzed. Especially the establishment of large-capacity wind turbine power stations, site selection is an arduous task. In order for wind turbine power stations to supply power regularly, there must be energy storage equipment to regulate the amount of electricity. Sometimes, it is also necessary to consider installing it together with water turbines or internal combustion engines to ensure that power is supplied at any time. The Dawangwu Township in Anci County, Hebei Province, recently established a combined wind, water, biogas, and fire power station, which is a creation of the masses in combination with local conditions.

    At present, the most important thing is to simplify the structure of low-speed, low-power wind turbines, obtain materials locally to reduce costs, and improve the design to ensure flexible and reliable use. To push forward the research and development of high-speed, high-power wind turbines, standardize and promote them. Then, according to local wind source conditions, implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small, and vigorously establish various wind turbine stations.

    风能的利用
    中国科学院动力研究室　吴文
    早在纪元前两千多年，我们的祖先就已经做出帆船，利用风力在黄河上行驶。接着又创制了船帆式风轮机（即风车），利用风能车水和加工谷粮，把风能应用到农业生产上。
      陆地表面流动空气的能量，超过可以利用的水能和每年开采出来的燃料能的总和
    全世界可以利用的风能潜量是异常巨大的。风能是直接来自太阳的辐射能。在达到地球表面的全部太阳能中，大约有2％的能量被大气层吸收。热升冷降，使得地球表面的全部空气发生流动，这就是风能的来源。不过，人们可以利用的风能，只是接近陆地表面一两百米以内的流动空气的能量，估计约为全部风能的1％到2％。即使这样，这项能量仍是异常庞大的，估计仍在两三百亿瓩左右，远远超过了全球每年可以利用的全部水能和目前每年开采出来的各种燃料能的总和。
    除去风能数量庞大之外，它还有个优点，就是风源容易寻找。只要有气象记录，就能确定适当的风轮机站，不必进行勘查钻探等等工作。只要有风，就可随时取用，不必投资开采。这比利用煤、石油等能源，又省时又方便。
    利用风能的机械，叫做风轮机（或称风力机、风车）。利用风能就是利用流动空气所具有的动能。当风流过风轮机时，风速就减小，也就是风的动能减小。这部分减小的动能，就为风轮机所吸收。从理论上讲，可以为风轮机所吸收的最高能量，为全部风的动能的零点五九三，这个数值称为最高风能利用系数。实际上，风轮机的风能利用系数都小于零点五九三，
    风的动能大小与风速的立方成正比，所以风速加大时，风的动能就增加得特别快。九级（风速二十米／秒左右）以上的暴风，就具有破坏的力量。风轮机一般工作在三级至七级（三至十四米／秒左右）风速范围之内，遇有暴风，就必须停止运行，不然就会遭受损坏。
    我国有许多地区可以使用风轮机；在风速较高的地区还可以建立一百瓩以上的大功率风轮机风轮机可以带动水车，进行排灌；或带动转磨，加工谷粮；或带动发电机，产生电力。这类机械所需能量不大，一般在一至十瓩之间，风轮机很容易满足这种要求，所以农村中最为适用。在我国内蒙草原、西北平原和山区以及新疆等地有些地区，往往因为缺水缺煤，不能建立水力、火力发电站，影响垦荒和农业生产。这些地区，一般多是一年四季有风，如果使用风轮机，最合理想。此外在沿海地区以及全国各地，风力很均匀普遍，都可使用风轮机。在风速较高的地区，还可以建立一百瓩以上的大功率风轮机，用以发电，供应工业建设需要。所以，利用风能，对于国民经济建设，意义是重大的。
    目前使用的风轮机，可以概括地分为两大类。一类是叶翼旋转平面与风向平行一致，转轴多为垂直方向，但也可为水平方向的；一类是叶翼旋转平面与风向垂直，转轴一律是水平方向的。第一类风轮机采用垂直转轴时，风从任何方向吹来，都能转动，这是它的优点。江苏省里下河一带农民创造的走马灯式的带八个到十个布帆叶翼的大风车，就属于这一类。这类风轮机的缺点是风能利用系数低。理想的最高值，仅为零点三三三。实际数值更低，在零点零八至零点一六之间。同时因为转动叶翼的直线速度始终比风速小，所以转轴的转速很低，如用以带动发电机，就必须有比较大的增速装置。由于能量利用系数低，以致单位功率需用材料多，造价就高，且结构复杂，不适用于高速风，所以这类风轮机，现已很少使用，正在被淘汰中。第二类风轮机是目前世界各国使用最多的一类。它可区分为简易的低转速的一种和现代化的高转速的一种。前者适用于产生五瓩以下的小功率，后者适用于产生十瓩以上的中大型功率。
    低转速的风轮机，一般具有叶翼四个至二十四个。叶翼直径大都在十米以下。叶翼可用布帆或木板做成。全部结构如叶翼、支架、转轴、调节装置等，除轴承少量金属接头及钢丝绳外，均可用木材竹料做成；因此可以就地取材，造价低廉；同时制造及使用技术，要求不高，所以在各国农村中，使用得比较早，也很普遍。例如目前我国江苏兴化县就有这种类型的风轮机三万多部，每部平均可产生功率三至五瓩。全国其他各地，也在大量使用，深为群众欢迎。十八世纪中叶，荷兰在全国各地，即建有此种风轮机七八千部，用以排灌和加工农产品，对于当时的荷兰国民经济建设，起了促进作用。直到今天，仍有一千多部在使用。此外如丹麦、希腊、英国等岛屿国家，在农村中，多年来也广泛地使用这种简易的风轮机。低转速风轮机比上述第一类风轮机较好，但仍有缺点，如风能利用系数低，结构复杂，不牢固，只适用于低速风等。所以当我们需要利用高速风产生大功率的时候，就不得不采用新型的高转速的风轮机了。
      许多国家都在加强高速风轮机的研究试制工作；目前全世界各种风轮机的总功率约为五十五万瓩
    高转速的风轮机，是一种现代化的动力机械。一般具有两个至四个叶翼。每个叶翼的剖面，都呈流线型，与飞机上螺旋桨叶翼剖面相似。自叶翼根部至尖端，沿不同半径处的剖面型线，也各不相同。选择这些剖面型线，要根据气体动力学来考虑决定；主要的要求是升力／阻力比愈大愈好；比值大就能提高风能利用系数。高速风轮机的使用，还是近几十年的事，不像低速风轮机出现得那么早，使用得那么普遍。但最近各国都在加强研究试制工作。例如英国于1949年在苏格兰海岸建立一台一百瓩的风轮机实验发电站，三个叶翼、液压变距调速，目前仍在运行。美国曾于1940年在北部山区建立了一个一千二百五十瓩的风轮机发电实验站，两个叶翼，全金属结构，进行五年研究工作的结果，认为大功率风轮机的机械结构问题，已可完满解决；而经济性更好的发电站功率，应在两千瓩左右。西德于1947年设计了一座一万四千瓩的巨型风轮机发电站，塔高二百五十米，利用风速较为稳定的高空气流，但迄今尚未制成。这些国家的研究试制工作至今仍在实验阶段。在创制高速现代化风轮机方面，苏联是远远走在世界各国的前面。首先流体力学大师儒可夫斯基奠定了风轮机的基本理论，找出了最高风能利用系数为零点五九三。1923年，苏联中央流体力学研究所创制了新型叶翼，使原有风轮机效率提高二到二点五倍。根据发表数字，到1954年止，全苏共有新型风轮机站近三万处，总功率约十二万瓩。最大发电机组为一百瓩。今后还准备建立三十瓩的发电站六十万处，广泛在国营农场和集体农庄中使用。
    我国对高速风轮机的研究试制工作，是在最近几年才开始的。但在短短的几年里，各地已先后做出品种不同的高速风轮机十多种，如营口十六点八米三翅机、辽宁活向尾车机组，吉林五十七型，内蒙58—7型等，成绩很大，为将来的推广使用提供了有利的条件。
    根据初步估计，目前全世界各种风轮机的总功率约为五十五万瓩，其能量相当于年产五十万吨煤。这个数量，若与全球可以利用的风能资源两三百亿瓩相比较，真是微不足道。什么原因限制了我们利用这项财富呢？大量利用风能的主要障碍有两方面。一方面是风轮机的性能不够完善，造价高。另一方面是风源不稳定：时有时无，时快时慢，同时风向也常改变，造成运行的不稳定。这对于被带动的动力机械和要求转速稳定的发电机来讲，都是不合适的。针对着这些问题，各国从事风轮机的工作者沿着不同的途径，进行研究。为了提高风轮机的效率，就必须对叶翼的气体动力学作理论的探讨。为了使风轮机能适应风源不定的情况，就需要提供有效的调向调速方法。对于低转速小功率风轮机的人工移位调向，尾翼或旋转尾车自动调向和人工操纵布帆调速的几种装置。对于高转速大功率风轮机的机械转向调速，液压变距调速，离心式稳定叶片调速和电动调向调速等装置，均需继续研究改进。而后者的调节装置，都应是高度自动化。为了避免暴风的袭击，每个风轮机就需装有自动安全防护措施，以免过速损毁。为了选定最有利的地点，建立风轮机站，就需要有长时间的可靠风源资料，并需进行整理分析。尤其是建立大功率风轮机发电站，选择地点是项繁重的工作。为了风轮机发电站能经常供电，就必须有调节电量的储能设备。有时还要考虑与水轮机，或者与内燃机一同安装，以保证随时供电。河北安次县大王务乡，最近建立了一座风、水、沼、火联合发电站，这是群众结合当地情况的创举。
    目前最要紧的事情是把低速小功率风轮机的机构简化，就地取材，以减低造价，同时改进设计，保证使用灵活可靠。把高速大功率风轮机的研究试制工作推进一步，定型推广。再按照当地风源条件，执行土洋并举，大中小相结合的方针，大力建立各种风轮机站。
