　　Sawing and Planing Sounds Late at Night

    Recently, in a tile-roofed house in the Yaojiapeng Production Team of the Chashanling Commune in Liling County, Hunan Province, the urgent sounds of planing, sawing, and axing could be heard constantly, day and night. These were the carpenters sent by the Shuangpang Brigade United Factory, helping the Yaojiapeng and other two production teams repair drought-fighting tools.

    The south wind was blowing hard, and the scorching sun was overhead. More than 240 mu of paddy fields in Yaojiapeng and other teams had already run out of water, and the tender green late rice began to turn yellow. In order to strive for late rice yields surpassing early rice, and to achieve large-scale production of 1,000 jin per mu, at this critical juncture, more than 80 hand and foot waterwheels could not be put into operation, and as the disaster was about to expand, Yao Jianqing and other seven veterans, carrying luggage and tools, arrived at the front line. How happy the commune members were! They were busy delivering carts and carrying materials. This enthusiastic and intense scene moved the seven old men. They proposed that water transport was urgent, and they would carry the materials themselves. As soon as the tools were put down, they didn't even have time to smoke a cigarette, and they quickly went to Xiao's courtyard to move materials and carry chopping blocks. They really didn't stop for a breath, and they also proposed that in order to achieve a late rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu, they should repair more blades, build more wheel hubs, make more eyes, transport more water, and save more rice seedlings. They worked all night that night and repaired nine treadle waterwheels. The commune members, carrying the repaired waterwheels, were enthusiastically discussing, they are really a few old hands, not to mention using planes and axes, it is not easy to pierce with paper!

    Not only were they highly efficient, but they also paid attention to saving materials, ensuring that not an inch of wood was wasted. Tang Jiazao, who made keel, increased production from 14 roots a day to 25 roots. In just five days, all 52 treadle waterwheels were repaired. More than 240 mu of rice seedlings were all supplied with water. They are now stationed at each pier, ensuring that drought-fighting tools are repaired as soon as they break down.

　　深夜的锯刨声
    最近，在湖南醴陵县茶山岭公社姚家棚生产队的一栋瓦房里，不论是白天、黑夜，都能听到急促的刨声、锯声、斧声响个不停。这就是双滂大队联合工厂派来的木工，他们正在帮助姚家棚等二个生产队修理抗旱工具。
    南风大发，烈日当头，姚家棚等队的二百四十多亩稻田已经断水，一片嫩绿的晚稻开始转黄。社员们为了争取晚稻赛早稻，实现大面积千斤丰产，在这紧要关头，八十多部手脚车不能出征，眼看着灾害扩大，正在这万分焦急的时候，姚尖清等七个老将，担着行李、工具来到了前线。社员们是多么的高兴啊！送车、背材料忙个不停。这种热情紧张的的场面，激动了七个老人。他们提出，车水要紧，材料让我们自己来背，工具刚放下，连一口烟也来不及抽，他们就飞快地到肖家屋场搬材料、背砍凳。他们真是一气不歇，还提出了为了晚稻亩产千斤，要多修一片车页、多造一个轮骨、多打一只眼、多车一气水、多救一兜禾。当晚干了一个通夜，就修好九梯水车，社员们背着修好的水车，都热烈的谈论着，真是几个老手，莫说是用刨子斧头，就是用纸也不容易扎呀！
    他们不但工效高，还注意节约材料，做到了寸木不丢。做龙骨的汤家早，由原先一天做十四根，提高到二十五根。只有五天的时间，五十二梯车，全部修好了。二百四十多亩禾苗都得到了水用。他们现在正分守在每个码头上，保证做到抗旱工具随坏随修。　（巫光华）（附图片）
