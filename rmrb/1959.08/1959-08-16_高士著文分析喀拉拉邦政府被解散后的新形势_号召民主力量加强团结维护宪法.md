Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 14th. A. K. Gopalan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, in an article titled "The Communist Party - Vanguard of Indian Democracy" in the latest issue of "New Age" weekly, said that the recent dissolution of the Kerala state government in India, "is the beginning of a frantic attack by the bourgeoisie itself on the bourgeois democratic system."

Gopalan traced the characteristics of the Congress Party's strategy to oust the Kerala government, pointing out that the Congress Party has fallen into "unprecedented isolation, away from the people, away from the tendencies that constitute the sum of India's democratic forces."

He reviewed "one of the greatest movements the Communist Party has carried out in its entire history" and the mass support the Communist Party received, and said, "The fact that the Communist Party of India was able to pass this test gloriously is a matter of profound significance and great fortune for the democratic movement."

Gopalan said, "Summarizing the entire situation, one can only say that, for the first time in the whole of India, the working class has inflicted a serious defeat on the Indian bourgeoisie politically and morally. This is indeed a turning point in the history of modern India."

Gopalan pointed out that "the Kerala crisis is not only a question of the Congress Party leadership being unable to tolerate the existence of a progressive, non-Congress government, even in one of India's fourteen states, but is a manifestation of something far deeper and more fundamental."

Gopalan said, "The economic policies by which the bourgeoisie hopes to consolidate its position have failed. The crisis first arose against this background." He said, "The capitalist path of development has proven to be not only a path of impoverishment for the people but also a path that prevents significant development of the national economy." He said, "Secondly, the dissatisfied masses have focused their attention on the working-class party, which in the past twelve years has appeared as the main challenger to the power and position of the bourgeois-led Congress Party. It is not the feudal right-wing reactionaries, but the emerging left-wing forces, led by the Communist Party, that have appeared on the Indian political stage as a true alternative force."

Gopalan said, "In the hearts of millions of our people, a prominent question is increasingly emerging: who will lead? The task of achieving proletarian leadership has been put on the agenda. The tasks of the unfinished democratic revolution can only be accomplished by the democratic forces under the leadership of the working class – this is becoming increasingly clear."

Gopalan pointed out that the bourgeoisie is facing a serious economic and political crisis, which "is first manifested in the crisis of bourgeois democracy."

Gopalan believes that the current anti-democratic movement is not some overreach or small conspiracy by a small group of people. He said, "This crisis is a product of the objective situation itself, arising from the bourgeoisie's fear of the threat to its own national leadership."

Gopalan said, "The conclusion that must be drawn and fully understood is that we cannot assume that bourgeois democracy is without problems. We must resolutely struggle against all revisionist and reformist ideas, and against all illusions that the road ahead is one of gradual and smooth progress." Gopalan said, "The ruling class in India will not automatically accept the decisions of the ballot box; if their interests are threatened, they will rise up against democracy itself. This has now been fully confirmed."

Gopalan said, "The second major conclusion that should be drawn is that there is currently strong democratic public opinion in India."

He pointed out, "Therefore, it is necessary to raise awareness to the point that even if the danger is very serious, the attack on democracy can be repelled. The Communist Party must avoid all sectarianism and redouble its efforts to unite all democratic forces, including some members of the Congress Party, to safeguard the Indian constitution and parliamentary system. This is an urgent task that allows no delay, no short-sightedness, and no panic."

    高士著文分析喀拉拉邦政府被解散后的新形势 
    号召民主力量加强团结维护宪法
    新华社新德里14日电　印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士在最近一期的“新世纪”周报上发表的一篇题为“共产党——保卫印度民主的先锋”的文章说，最近解散印度喀拉拉邦政府的行动，
  “是资产阶级自己向资产阶级民主制度进行疯狂进攻的开端。”
    高士追溯国大党赶走喀拉拉邦政府的策略的特点，他指出，国大党已经陷于“空前孤立，离开了人民，离开了各种构成印度民主力量总和的倾向。”
    他回顾了“共产党在它整个历史中进行过的一次最大的运动”以及共产党所得到的群众支持，并说，“印度共产党能够光荣地通过这次考验，这对民主运动来说，是一件意义极其深刻的事，是一件非常幸运的事。”
    高士说，“总结整个形势，人们只能说：我国工人阶级，在全印范围内，在政治和道义方面，第一次使印度资产阶级遭到严重失败。这的确是现代印度的历史上的一个转折点。”
    高士指出，“喀拉拉邦危机不仅是这样一个问题，即国大党领导不能容忍一个进步的、非国大党的政府那怕是在印度十四个邦中的一个邦里存在，而是某种远为深刻得多、根本得多的东西的表现。”
    高士说，“资产阶级希望借以巩固其地位的经济政策失败了。危机首先是在这种背景下发生的。”他说，“资本主义发展道路已证明不仅是人民贫困化的道路，同样也是民族经济不能有重大发展的道路。”他说，“其次，感到不满的群众已把注意力集中于工人阶级政党，这个政党在过去十二年内是以资产阶级领导的国大党的权力和地位的主要挑战者的姿态出现的。作为一个真正的取而代之的力量出现在印度政治舞台上的，不是封建的右派反动派，而是以共产党为先锋的新兴的左派力量”。
    高士说，“在我国千百万人心中，愈来愈出现一个突出的问题，那就是：谁来领导？取得无产阶级领导地位的任务已经列在日程上。没有完成的民主革命的任务，只能由在工人阶级的领导下的民主力量来完成——这一点已愈来愈明显了。”
    高士指出，资产阶级面临着严重的经济和政治危机，这“首先是从资产阶级民主的危机上表现出来。”
    高士认为目前反民主的运动并不是一小撮人的某种越轨行为，某种小阴谋。他说，“这个危机是客观形势本身的产物，是由于资产阶级害怕它的国家领导地位本身受到威胁这种心理所产生的。”
    高士说，“必须得出的和充分了解的结论是，我们不能认为资产阶级民主是没有问题的。必须严格地同一切修正主义和改良主义的思想作斗争，对于一切认为将来的道路是逐渐地和顺利地前进的道路的幻想也必须与之作斗争。”高士说，“印度的统治阶级是不会自动接受投票箱的决定的，如果他们的利益受到威胁，他们就会起来反对民主本身。这一点现在已经得到充分证实。”
    高士说，“应当得出的第二个主要结论，是印度目前存在着强大的民主舆论。”
    他指出，“因此有必要把认识提高到这一步：即使危险很严重，对民主的进攻是能够被击退的。共产党必须避免一切宗派主义，加倍努力来团结所有的民主力量，包括一些国大党人在内，来维护印度的宪法和议会制度。这是一个迫切的任务，不容有任何迟缓，不容有任何短浅之见，也不必惊慌。”
