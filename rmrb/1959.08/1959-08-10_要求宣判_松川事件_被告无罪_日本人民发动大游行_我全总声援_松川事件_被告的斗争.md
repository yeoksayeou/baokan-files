Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 5th: Two parade teams of Japanese people demanding the acquittal of all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" set off from Kofu City in Yamanashi Prefecture and Numazu City in Shizuoka Prefecture today to march towards Tokyo, setting off a climax in the movement to support the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

Since the Japanese Supreme Court announced that it would try the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" on August 10, the Japanese people have actively launched a movement across the country to demand the acquittal of the defendants.

Tomorrow morning, four more parade teams will depart from Maebashi City in Gunma Prefecture, Utsunomiya City in Tochigi Prefecture, Mito City in Ibaraki Prefecture, and Choshi City in Chiba Prefecture, respectively, heading towards Tokyo.

Participating in each parade team are defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" who were framed by the US-Japanese reactionaries, as well as representatives of workers, farmers, youth, women, students, and other organizations from all over the country. Each parade team will have 2,000 members, and they are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the day the Supreme Court pronounces the verdict on the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants—the 10th.

Along the way, the parade teams will expose the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident," in which Japanese patriotic workers were persecuted, to the local masses. (Attached picture)
