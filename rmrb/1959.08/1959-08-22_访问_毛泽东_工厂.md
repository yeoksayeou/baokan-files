　　Visiting the "Mao Zedong" Factory
　　By Our Correspondent Wei Lingbing
    Anyone entering the "Mao Zedong" Factory in Bucharest will immediately feel its vibrant atmosphere. As the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Romania approaches, the factory is showing a scene of intense activity, bustling and full of joy.

    Inside the workshops, the production competition held by workers to welcome the festival has reached its climax. They are all striving to overfulfill their production plans with the most tenacious labor, so as to happily celebrate this great festival. Everywhere in the factory are hung slogans to welcome the festival, some reading "Strive to overfulfill the 1959 production plan," and some reading "Salute to the fraternal Chinese people who are building socialism."

    Many workers' militia members in blue uniforms marched out from various workshops to assemble. They are stepping up their training, preparing to be reviewed by party and state leaders on the festival day. A group of girls are tidying up the flags and bouquets for the parade in the yard. The sound of singing practice is coming from another place.

    We walked into the steelmaking and casting workshop, where two electric furnaces blazed with fierce flames. The steelworkers here originally decided to overproduce fifty tons of steel from July 1st to August 23rd. Encouraged by the recent resolutions of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, they guaranteed to overproduce one hundred tons of steel during this period. Production team leader Dumitru said that they are confident of completing this guarantee. The production team he leads has increased the average hourly steel output from 0.5 tons in early July to the current 0.8 tons.

    Casting production team leader Balbulescu, upon hearing that we were writing an article to introduce their factory to the Chinese people, also approached us, hoping to have his production team written about. He said that his production team overfulfilled the task by 35% in July, and now guarantees to complete the August production plan five days ahead of schedule. The quality of the castings they produce fully meets the specifications.

    We also entered the boiler manufacturing workshop, which has been producing boilers for China since 1956. Here, the sound of welding machines was like a torrential rain, and various types of furnace bodies and other mechanical equipment filled the workshop. A boiler foreman named Niczoi Dumitru was particularly happy to see us. He had worked in Shandong Province for nearly a year and only returned to his country in 1957. He spoke to us in the Chinese he had learned. He said that the boilers they made for China were "guaiguai de" (very good), and they would make even better boilers for China in the future. Here we saw a boiler that had already been labelled with an address and was waiting to be shipped to China. Workshop engineer Hucian Petre told us that they decided to manufacture two locomotive boilers for the Hunedoara Metallurgical Combine a month ahead of schedule, and to manufacture a large boiler for China in August, exceeding the plan... Like other workshops, the workers' enthusiasm for work in this workshop was also unprecedentedly high. On the day of our visit, the welders who were manufacturing orders for the Soviet Union requested to work an extra four hours of voluntary work after get off work. The boiler foreman mentioned above who had been to China also worked overtime to manufacture orders for China.

    In the machine installation workshop, we visited the Grand National Assembly delegate and veteran lathe operator, Aiconomu Alistie. Fifteen years ago, he took up arms to fight the German devils for the liberation of his motherland. He now operates large lathes, manufacturing parts for petroleum machinery and boilers. In the heated production competition movement, this old worker with gray hair and missing teeth is not inferior to the young men. In order to welcome the festival, he guaranteed to complete the August production plan two days ahead of schedule. The enthusiasm of the young lathe operator Constantin is well-known throughout the factory. Last month, he worked continuously for twenty-four hours to rush-produce cement equipment for China. When we asked him about his current production plan, he took a small blackboard from the wall and showed it to us. It said that he would overfulfill the August production plan by 20%.

    We also visited other workshops and workers. Here, touching examples are endless and cannot be fully written about. However, you can summarize all of this in one sentence, that is, the workers of the "Mao Zedong" Factory have a high degree of patriotism and internationalism.

    Comrade Factory Director Gao Moyou introduced to us the history of the factory and the struggles carried out by the workers under the leadership of the Party.

    Before liberation, people praised the workers of this factory for having the "sickle and axe spirit" because they waged unyielding struggles against capitalists and reactionary rulers. In 1918, inspired by the October Revolution, they shed blood for the first time against their domestic rulers. They also participated in the nationwide strike that swept the country in 1933. In 1936, seven workers from this factory responded to the call of the Communist Party and went to Spain to join the International Brigade, two of whom sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the Spanish people. Fifteen years ago, many workers participated in the war to liberate the motherland and fight against fascism. These historical facts show that the workers of the "Mao Zedong" Factory have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Their patriotism and internationalism did not start today.

    This factory was initially established by an Austrian capitalist. In 1907, after a group of Romanian capitalists invested in it, it was renamed the "Urgan" Factory. At that time, it produced parts for petroleum machinery and railway transportation, as well as boilers and cranes. The entire factory's power was only 75 horsepower, and it mainly relied on manual labor. In the forty-four years of bourgeois management, the average annual product was only 2,500 tons.

    After nationalization in 1948, this factory embarked on a path of rapid development. The main workshops and new equipment now are all built in the past ten years. This year, it will produce 30,000 tons of metal products, equivalent to twelve times the annual output before liberation, and an increase of 33% compared to last year's output.

    This factory now produces boilers, cranes, cement equipment, petroleum equipment, etc. In addition to supplying domestic needs, these products are also exported to other countries, a large part of which is shipped to China.

    In 1953, on the occasion of Chairman Mao's sixtieth birthday, the workers of this factory, in order to express their respect for Chairman Mao, requested that their factory be named the "Mao Zedong" Factory. Since then, the connection between this factory and China has become closer day by day. From 1956 to now, this factory has manufactured twenty-six large boilers and ten sets of cement equipment for China, and is currently continuing to manufacture these products for China, and has also accepted China's orders for 1960. The "Mao Zedong" Factory not only supports China's socialist construction with its products, but has also sent four outstanding boiler and welding experts to China to contribute to the Chinese people.

### 访问“毛泽东”工厂

　　访问“毛泽东”工厂
　　本报记者　魏凌冰
    任何人走进布加勒斯特的“毛泽东”工厂都会立刻感到它的沸腾的生活气息。在罗马尼亚解放十五周年纪念日快要到来的时候，这个工厂更是呈现出一片紧张繁忙和喜气洋洋的景象。
    在车间内，工人们为迎接节日而进行的生产竞赛已经达到了高潮，他们都在用最顽强的劳动争取超额完成生产计划，痛痛快快地度过这个伟大节日。工厂内到处都挂着迎接节日的标语牌，上面有的写着“为超额完成1959年生产计划而斗争”，有的写着“向正在建设社会主义的兄弟的中国人民致敬”。
    许多穿蓝军装的雄赳赳的工人自卫队队员从各个车间跑出集合，他们要加紧操练，准备在节日那天接受党和国家领导人的检阅。一群姑娘们正在院子里整理游行时用的旗子和花束。从另一个地方传来了练习唱歌的声音。
    我们走进了炼钢和铸造车间，两座电炉冒着熊熊的火光。这里的炼钢工人本来决定在7月1日到8月23日超计划生产五十吨钢，由于受到最近工人党中央全会决议的鼓舞，他们又保证在这段时间超计划生产一百吨钢。生产队长杜米特鲁说，他们有把握完成这个保证。他领导的生产队已经把每小时的平均出钢量由7月初的零点五吨增加到现在的零点八吨。
    铸造生产队队长巴尔布列斯库听说我们要写文章向中国人民介绍他们的工厂，也向我们走来，希望把他的生产队也写上几笔。他说，他的生产队在7月份超计划35％完成了任务，现在保证提前五天完成8月份的生产计划。他们生产的铸件的质量完全合乎规格。
    我们又走进从1956年起就为中国生产锅炉的锅炉制造车间。在这里，电焊机的声音像急风骤雨，各式各样的炉体和其他机械设备摆满了车间。一个名叫尼曹伊·杜米特鲁的锅炉工长见我们来到特别高兴。他曾在山东省工作过将近一年，1957年才回国。他用学来的中国话同我们交谈。他说，他们为中国制造的锅炉都是“乖乖的”（很好），以后要为中国制造更好的锅炉。在这里我们看到了一个已经写上地址等待运往中国的锅炉。车间工程师胡次安·彼特列向我们说，他们决定提前一个月为胡乃道拉冶金联合厂制造两个机车型锅炉，在8月份超计划为中国制造一个大型锅炉……。这个车间也和其他车间一样，工人们的劳动热情空前高涨。在我们访问的那天，为苏联制造订货的电焊工人要求在下班后再义务工作四小时。上面谈到的那位到过中国的锅炉工长也曾为给中国制造订货加班加点。
    在机器安装车间我们访问了大国民议会代表、老镟工艾克诺木·阿历斯蒂耶。十五年前，为了祖国的解放他曾拿起枪同德国鬼子作战。他现在是操纵大型车床，制造石油机械和锅炉的部件。在热火朝天的生产竞赛运动中，这位头发斑白、掉了几颗牙齿的老工人一点也不逊于小伙子。为了迎接节日，他保证提前两天完成8月份的生产计划。青年镟工康斯坦丁的干劲是全厂闻名的。在上月份他曾为给中国赶制水泥设备连续工作了二十四小时。在我们问到他现在的生产计划时，他从墙上摘下一块小黑板给我们看，上面写着他要超计划20％完成8月份的生产计划。
    我们还访问了另外的一些车间和工人。在这里，动人的事例是看不完、写不完的。但是，你也可以把这一切概括成为一句话，那就是：“毛泽东”工厂的工人有高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神。
    厂长高沫友同志向我们介绍了这个工厂的历史情况和工人们在党的领导下所进行的斗争。
    在解放前，人们都赞扬这个工厂的工人有“镰刀和斧头精神”，因为他们同资本家和反动统治者进行了不屈不挠的斗争。1918年他们在十月革命的鼓舞下，为反对本国统治者第一次流了血。他们还在1933年就参加了风靡全国的大罢工。在1936年，这个工厂有七名工人响应共产党的号召到西班牙参加国际志愿军，其中有两人为西班牙人民的自由献出了生命。在十五年前，许多工人参加了解放祖国和反法西斯的战争。这些历史事实说明了“毛泽东”工厂的工人有着光荣的革命传统。他们的爱国主义和国际主义精神并不是从今天才开始的。
    这个工厂起初是由一个奥地利资本家建立的。1907年，一批罗马尼亚资本家投资后改名为“乌尔干”工厂。那时生产石油机械和铁路运输用的零件，以及锅炉、吊车等。全厂的动力只有七十五马力，主要是手工劳动。在资产阶级经营的四十四年中，平均每年的产品只有二千五百吨。
    在1948年实行国有化后，这个工厂走上了迅速发展的道路。现在的主要车间和新式设备都是在最近十年中建立的。今年将生产三万吨金属产品，相当于解放前年产量的十二倍，比去年的产量增长了33％。
    这个工厂现在生产着锅炉、吊车、水泥设备、石油设备等。这些产品除去供应本国需要外，还向其他国家输出，其中很大部分是运往中国。
    在1953年毛主席六十寿辰的时候，这个工厂的工人为了表示对毛主席的敬意，要求把自己的工厂命名为“毛泽东”工厂。从这以后，这个工厂同中国的联系就一天比一天更加密切了。从1956年到现在，这个工厂已经为中国制造了二十六个大型锅炉和十套水泥设备，目前正继续为中国制造这些产品，同时还接受了1960年的中国订货。“毛泽东”工厂不但用它的产品支援着中国的社会主义建设，并且先后派了四位优秀的锅炉、电焊专家到中国，为中国人民作出了贡献。（附图片）
