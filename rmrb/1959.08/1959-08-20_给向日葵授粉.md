　　Pollinating Sunflowers
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: People's Communes in Jilin Province are carrying out artificial pollination, soil loosening, and removal of bottom leaves for sunflowers, in order to promote early maturity and full grains of the sunflowers.
    Sunflowers are cross-pollinating plants, which in the past relied only on wind and insects to spread pollen, often resulting in insufficient pollination, leading to shriveled grains and reduced yields. This year, various localities have absorbed past experiences and, in sunflower field management, have emphasized the crucial link of artificial pollination. Throughout the province, 150,000 mu of sunflowers have already undergone artificial pollination.

　　给向日葵授粉
    据新华社讯　吉林省各人民公社正在给向日葵进行人工授粉、松土和打底叶等工作，促使向日葵早日成熟，子粒饱满。
    向日葵是异花授粉植物，过去只靠风力、昆虫传布花粉，常因授粉不足而癟粒减产。今年各地吸取以往经验，在向日葵田间管理中，突出抓紧人工辅助授粉这一环节，全省已有十五万亩向日葵作了人工辅助授粉。
