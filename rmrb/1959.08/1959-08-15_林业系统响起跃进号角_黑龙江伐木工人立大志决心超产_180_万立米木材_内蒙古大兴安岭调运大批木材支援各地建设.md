Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: The 280,000 forestry workers in Heilongjiang Province, who are responsible for approximately one-third of the country's total timber production this year, have overfulfilled the timber production plan for January to July, and in August, they overfulfilled the production plan for the first ten days by 8%. On August 11th, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of leading cadres from the province's forestry departments to analyze and summarize the situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward on the forestry front and the existing problems. They mobilized all forestry workers to continue to exert their efforts and launch a greater upsurge in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The forestry departments of the province are determined to increase timber production by another 1.8 million cubic meters, in addition to ensuring the comprehensive completion of this year's state plan, to support national production and construction.

Heilongjiang Province's forestry production has entered a new stage of combining log production with comprehensive utilization of timber and combining harvesting with reforestation. This year, an all-round Great Leap Forward situation has continued. Forestry workers in various regions have vigorously engaged in technological innovation and technological revolution. While receiving state support, they have independently smelted iron to make indigenous machine tools, indigenous loaders, and various mechanical parts, used waste materials to renovate old equipment, and created more than 40 new tools such as "wooden slides," "wooden tanks," "aerial cableways," and "combined logging vehicles," increasing the proportion of mechanization and semi-mechanization in forestry production from 30% last year to approximately 60%. These achievements have ensured that the timber production plan was overfulfilled every month from January to July this year, with log output increasing by 49% compared to the same period last year. More than 7 million cubic meters of timber have been transferred to support production and construction in various parts of the country.

The forestry departments throughout the province have also achieved great success in comprehensive utilization of forest resources, with log production as the center. Forestry bureaus throughout the province have overfulfilled the timber processing and sawing plan for January to July. Twenty-seven fiberboard production workshops and factories have been established from scratch, using waste materials such as processing residues, strips, cut-offs, and sawdust to produce 321 tons of beautiful and durable fiberboard and wood wool board. From January to July, the province also produced 17,163 tons of rosin, tannin extract, turpentine, vinegar stone, etc., an increase of 2.2 times compared to the same period last year, and the variety has also increased from 12 types in the past to 53 types. At present, there are more than 500 timber processing plants and forest chemical plants that comprehensively utilize forest resources throughout the province. The establishment of these factories has increased the processing utilization rate of timber from 60% in the past to more than 85%.

By the end of July this year, 92% of the province's annual reforestation plan for harvested areas had been completed. The area of reforestation in the first seven months of this year exceeded five and a half times the average annual reforestation area in the province over the past three years. This has changed the historical situation in which reforestation work in harvested areas could not keep up with harvesting for a long time.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: The Greater Khingan Mountains forest area in Inner Mongolia is transferring large quantities of timber to support national construction. In July, this forest area overfulfilled the timber transfer task, transferring more than 290,000 cubic meters of logs and more than 40,000 cubic meters of finished timber.

In the first half of this year, the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area transported a total of more than 1.5 million cubic meters of timber, of which pit props accounted for one-third. In order to transport the large amount of timber harvested in the second half of the year more quickly, the Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Administration has strengthened its leadership over this work since the third quarter and taken a series of measures to organize the supply of goods. They strengthened cooperation with the railway departments and jointly established a timber transfer organization, increasing the number of loaded cars in mid-July from more than 2,400 in the first ten days of the month to more than 2,600.

　　林业系统响起跃进号角
　　黑龙江伐木工人立大志决心超产180万立米木材
　　内蒙古大兴安岭调运大批木材支援各地建设
    新华社哈尔滨讯　担负着今年全国约三分之一原木生产任务的黑龙江省二十八万林业职工，继超额完成1月到7月份木材生产计划之后，8月份又超额8％完成了上旬生产计划。11日，中共黑龙江省委召开全省林业部门领导干部会议，分析总结了林业战线上全面跃进的形势和存在的问题，动员全体林业职工继续鼓足干劲，掀起增产节约运动的更大高潮。全省林业部门职工决心在保证全面完成今年国家计划的基础上，再增产木材一百八十万立方米，支援全国生产建设。
    黑龙江省的林业生产已进入原木生产和综合利用木材相结合，采伐且更新造林相结合的新阶段。今年，继续出现了全面跃进的局面。各地林业职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，在得到国家支援的同时，自炼钢铁制成土机床、土装车机和各种机械零件，利用废料装修旧设备，并且创造了“木滑道”、“木坦克”、“架轨索道”、“集材拼车”等四十多种新工具，使林业生产的机械化与半机械化比重从去年的30％发展到60％左右。这些成就，保证了今年头七个月月月超额完成木材生产计划，比去年同期的原木产量增长49％；并已调运出七百多万立方米木材，支援了全国各地的生产建设。
    全省林业部门在以原木生产为中心，大搞森林资源综合利用方面，也取得很大成绩。全省各林业局已超额完成1月至7月份的木材加工制材计划；从无到有地建立起二十七个纤维板生产车间和工厂，利用加工剩余的板皮、板条、截头、木屑等废料制成了三百二十一吨美观坚固的纤维板和木丝板等。在1月至7月份，全省还生产了松香、栲胶、松节油、醋石等一万七千一百六十三吨，比去年同期增产二点二倍，品种也由去年以前的十二种增加到五十三种。目前，全省已有五百多个综合利用森林资源的木材加工厂和林产化学工厂。这些厂的建立，已使木材的加工利用率由过去的60％提高到85％以上。
    到今年7月底止，全省全年采伐迹地更新计划也已完成了92％。今年前七个月更新造林的面积，超过了全省过去三年每年平均更新造林面积的五倍半。这就改变了历史上长期以来采伐迹地更新工作赶不上采伐的情况。
    新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林区调运大批木材支援国家建设。7月份，这个林区超额完成了木材调运任务，共调运原木二十九万多立方米，成材四万多立方米。
    今年上半年，大兴安岭林区共运出一百五十多万立方米木材，其中坑木占三分之一。为了把下半年采伐下来的大量木材更多更快地调运出去，大兴安岭林业管理局从第三季度以来特别加强了对这项工作的领导，并采取一系列措施组织货源。他们与铁路部门加强协作，统一成立了木材调运机构，使7月中旬的装车数由上旬的二千四百多车增加到二千六百多车。（附图片）
