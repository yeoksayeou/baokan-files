Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 21st: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary today on the British government's letter delivered to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain on August 17th, proposing that the United Nations send "observers" to Laos. The commentary stated that the United Nations has no right to discuss the Laotian issue, let alone send "observers" to Laos. United Nations intervention would violate the Geneva Accords for resolving the Laotian issue in accordance with the interests of the Laotian people and the interests of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The commentary criticized the British government for using the pretext that the Laotian government "has fully fulfilled the Geneva Accords on Laos" and that Laos' sovereignty must be respected to prevent the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos.

After pointing out that the root and direct cause of the current serious situation in Laos is the interference of U.S. imperialism, the commentary said that it is precisely U.S. imperialism that instigated the Sananikone government to issue calls for United Nations intervention, so as to allow U.S. imperialism to realize its extremely dangerous conspiracy, namely to internationalize the Laotian issue, rope in U.S. vassals under the banner of the United Nations to more brazenly interfere in Laotian internal affairs, and then turn Laos into a war base for the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, threatening the security of neighboring peace-loving countries.

The commentary pointed out that under the above-mentioned conspiracy and dangerous actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos, if the United Nations is allowed to intervene in Laos, the Laotian issue will not only not be resolved, but will make the Laotian situation even more complex and serious.

The commentary expressed complete agreement with the propositions elaborated in the statement issued by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 17th, and demanded that the British government recognize its responsibilities and adopt a correct attitude to seek effective measures with the Soviet government to extinguish the Laotian flames of war that are seriously threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　越南“人民报”发表评论指出
    联合国无权讨论老挝问题
    新华社河内21日电　越南“人民报”今天就英国政府在8月17日交给苏联驻英国大使的一封信中提出联合国派“观察员”到老挝的建议发表评论说，联合国无权讨论老挝问题，更无权派“观察员”到老挝去。联合国的干涉将违反按照老挝人民的利益以及印度支那和东南亚地区和平的利益来解决老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    评论批评英国政府以所谓老挝政府“已经圆满地履行了关于老挝的日内瓦协议”和必须尊重老挝的主权为借口，来阻止恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    评论在指出了老挝当前的严重局势的根源和直接原因是美帝国主义的干涉后说，正是美帝国主义唆使萨纳尼空政府发出要求联合国干涉的叫嚣，以便让美帝国主义有可能实现它的极其危险的阴谋，即把老挝问题国际化，拉拢美国的附庸国打着联合国的旗帜来更加猖狂地干涉老挝内政，进而把老挝变成东南亚侵略集团的战争基地，威胁毗邻的爱好和平国家的安全。
    评论指出，在美帝国主义和它在老挝的走狗的上述阴谋和危险行动的情况下，如果让联合国干涉老挝，老挝问题不仅不能解决，反而会使老挝局势变得更加复杂而严重。
    评论表示完全同意苏联外交部8月17日发表的声明中所阐述的主张，并且要求英国政府认清自己的责任和采取正确的态度同苏联政府寻求有效的措施来扑灭正在严重威胁到印度支那和东南亚地区和平的老挝战火。
