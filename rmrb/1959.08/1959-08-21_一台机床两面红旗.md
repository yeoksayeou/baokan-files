One Lathe, Two Red Flags

Two dazzling red flags of victory fly simultaneously above a lathe in the Third Work Section of the Second Workshop of the Qiqihar Second Machine Tool Plant. It signifies that the two young lathe operators, Li Zhenguo and Liu Shuangtang, who work on the same lathe, have both achieved initial success in the "same lathe, double shift" competition launched to create new achievements and welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

Since the beginning of the third quarter, Liu Shuangtang and Li Zhenguo have been competing against each other in a red flag competition. In July, neither lagged behind the other, and both completed two months' worth of work in one month. On August 2nd, the workshop assigned the Third Work Section the task of processing four thousand small shafts, specifically assigning it to two machine tools, with the lathe where Liu Shuangtang and Li Zhenguo worked being one of them. This time, the small shaft to be processed was a new product, and no one was familiar with the operating methods. Liu Shuangtang's shift was the first. He worked closely with his apprentice, with the apprentice taking charge of loading and unloading materials, and the master operator focusing on running the machine. They adopted a high-speed cutting method, increasing the lathe's revolutions and reducing the stopping time for loading and unloading. According to the prescribed target, it should take seven minutes to process one, with each shift processing sixty-eight. However, Liu Shuangtang processed two hundred and ninety in his first shift. When Li Zhenguo came to take over, he was quite surprised to see that the red arrow on the "Dedication Competition Platform" for Liu Shuangtang's shift had risen to the position of three days in just one day. He immediately humbly asked Liu Shuangtang how he had accomplished it. Liu Shuangtang truthfully told him his operating method, and he also operated according to this method, completing two hundred and forty-five in one shift, still forty-five short of catching up. At the handover, he said to Liu Shuangtang confidently, "Master Liu, I must catch up with you in the next shift!" Liu Shuangtang said, "In order to complete the national plan, we should work harder. I hope you will put in more effort to surpass me!"

After Liu Shuangtang said this, he thought that he also had to secretly exert himself even more. He thought that Li Zhenguo, this young man, had a lot of momentum, and was indeed his opponent in the first half of the year's competition. He had never lagged behind him; don't think that he didn't catch up in this shift, maybe he would find a trick in the next shift and catch up all at once, so he couldn't be careless and slack off! Therefore, when he took over again, he pondered that it was not enough to rely solely on master-apprentice cooperation, and he had to improve the operating method. He thought that in the past, only one cutting tool was used to cut the shaft, and after it was cut, it had to be reversed to flatten the head, and the stopping time for loading and unloading alone would waste one and a half minutes. So he added a side tool to the side of the tool holder, so that one tool insertion could complete two processes, and as a result, he completed three hundred and twenty-six in this shift, further improving efficiency compared to the last time.

Li Zhenguo did not admit defeat after seeing Liu Shuangtang's new achievements. He found that although Liu Shuangtang's use of multi-tool and multi-chuck operation solved the problem of cutting depth, it still wasted time because there was no positioning and the workpiece had to be measured during the cutting process. He asked the quality inspector, Wei Xianming, and manufactured a locator, so that when processing the middle groove of the small shaft, the length and distance were immediately positioned, and there was no need to measure the workpiece again, ensuring quality. As a result, one shift completed three hundred and forty-six, surpassing Liu Shuangtang. Liu Shuangtang learned Li Zhenguo's new experience, and each shift also completed more than three hundred pieces.

By August 11th, the small red arrows of the two people on the "Dedication Competition Platform" had reached the sky and turned a corner. The factory had set the work quota for each technician in August at two hundred and eight hours, while Li Zhenguo completed two hundred and sixty hours, exceeding the quota by fifty-two hours; Liu Shuangtang completed two hundred and forty-six hours, exceeding the quota by thirty-eight hours. The quality of the products all reached the excellent level. From then on, two red flags were inserted on one lathe. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 一台机床两面红旗

    一台机床两面红旗
    两面耀眼的优胜红旗，同时飘扬在齐齐哈尔第二机床厂二车间三工段的一台机床上。它标志着，同在这一台车床上干活的两个青年车工李振国和刘双堂，在为创造新成就迎接国庆十周年而开展的同机台双班竞赛，已经双双旗开得胜。
    刘双堂和李振国进入三季度以来就作为对手双方，展开了红旗竞赛。他们在7月份里，谁也没拉下谁，都用一个月的时间完成了两个月的工作量。8月2日，车间下达给三工段四千根小轴的加工任务，具体分配给两个机台加工，刘双堂和李振国所在的这台车床正好是其中的一台。这回加工的小轴是一种新的产品，谁也不熟悉操作方法。第一班加工的是刘双堂，他同徒弟密切合作，徒弟专管上下活，师傅专管开车。他们采用了高速切削的操作方法，提高了车床的转数，减少了上下活停车时间。这类活按规定指标是七分钟加工一个，每班加工六十八个，而刘双堂头一班就加工了二百九十个。李振国来接班，一看“献礼竞赛台”上刘双堂班的那根红箭头一天就上升到三天的位置上，实在有些惊讶，他立即虚心地询问刘双堂怎样完成的。刘双堂把自己的操作方法如实地告诉了他，他也按照这个方法操作起来，一班完成了二百四十五个，还差四十五个没撵上。交班的时候，他满怀信心地对刘双堂说：“刘师傅，下一班一定要赶上你！”刘双堂说：“为了完成国家计划，我们应当多努一把力，希望你多使一些劲超过我！”
    刘双堂说完这句话，心想自己也得暗暗地更加使劲。他思量李振国这小伙子有一股猛劲，在上半年竞赛时确实是自己的对手，一直也没有拉下他；别看他这班没赶上，也许下班他找个窍门一下子就赶上了，可千万不能马虎松劲啊！因此，当他再接班的时候，就琢磨着光靠师徒合作还不够，还得改进操作方法。他想到过去只用一把刀切削轴杆，切好了后还得倒一次刀再截平头，光上下活停车就要浪费一分半钟，于是就在刀架侧面加上一把偏刀，进一次刀就可完成两道工序的作业，结果这一班完成了三百二十六个，效率比上次又有提高。
    李振国看到刘双堂的新成绩后，并没有认输。他发现刘双堂使用多刀多卡的操作方法，虽然解决了吃刀量问题，但是由于没有定位，还得在切削过程中量活，仍然浪费时间。他请教检质员魏显明，制造了一个定位器，这样在加工小轴中间圆槽时，一下就把长短距离定位了，再不用量活，又保证了质量。结果一个班完成了三百四十六个，超过了刘双堂。刘双堂学习了李振国的新经验，每班也完成三百个以上的活。
    到8月11日，两个人的小红箭头在“献礼竞赛台”上顶了天又拐了弯。厂里下达8月份每个技工的工时定额为二百零八个小时，而李振国完成了二百六十个小时，超额五十二个小时；刘双堂完成了二百四十六个小时，超额三十八个小时。产品质量，都达到了优等。从此一台车床上，插上了两面红旗。　（新华社）
