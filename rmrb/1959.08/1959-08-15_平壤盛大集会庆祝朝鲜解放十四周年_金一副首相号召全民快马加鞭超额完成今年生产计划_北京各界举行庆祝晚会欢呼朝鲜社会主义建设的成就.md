Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: Over 800 representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand rally at the Moranbong Theater tonight to celebrate the "August 15th" Fourteenth Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea.

Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, Kim Il-sung, attended the rally. Also present at the rally were leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, including Choi Yong-kun, Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, and Kim Chang-man, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Korea.

Vice Premier Kim Il of the Cabinet of Korea delivered a report at the rally. He said that the Korean working people greeted the "August 15th" Fourteenth Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea with the brilliant achievement of completing the First Five-Year Plan two and a half years ahead of schedule in the first half of this year. He said that in the past fourteen years, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people have carried out a heroic struggle that has fundamentally changed the face of the motherland, leaping from a colonial, semi-feudal society into a socialist society, and transforming from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial-agricultural nation.

He said: After the completion of this year's plan, Korea's industrial production will reach seven times that of pre-war levels. Last year, 3.7 million tons of grain, twice the output of 1946, were produced, completely solving the food problem. He called on all Korean people to continue to redouble their efforts to complete and exceed this year's plan.

Kim Il condemned the crimes of the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique for undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, turning South Korea into a nuclear base, and intensifying the tense situation in Korea. He said: Because the governments of Korea and China have taken proactive measures, the Chinese People's Volunteers have already completely withdrawn from Korea last year. The U.S. military no longer has any excuse to remain in South Korea. He said that we once again firmly demand the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.

Kim Il said: We have repeatedly maintained that the Korean question must be resolved by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis and by peaceful means without foreign interference. No matter how frantically the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique obstruct it, the day is coming when all the people of North and South Korea will live a happy life in a unified homeland.

Kim Il said that the signing of the agreement between the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan is another great joyous event for all the Korean people. This is the result of the consistent and sincere efforts of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government for the early return of Korean residents in Japan, the victory of the struggle of all the Korean people, and the victory of humanitarianism. The Korean people have made all preparations, waiting for the early return of Korean residents in Japan to the embrace of the motherland.

He said that Korea welcomes with great satisfaction the communique on the mutual visits of the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, which will make a great contribution to easing international tensions. He said: This is the achievement of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy of peaceful coexistence of different systems and resolving international problems through talks, and it is the bankruptcy of the outdated "strength" policy.

In his report, Kim Il, on behalf of the Korean people, expressed warm congratulations and gratitude to the liberator of Korea – the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. He said: We will always move forward with the Soviet people. Belyshev, the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in Korea, then spoke at the rally, congratulating the Korean people on the brilliant achievements they have made in socialist construction. He said that the Soviet people support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. After the meeting, famous Korean artists performed wonderful artistic programs.

Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: More than 700 workers and cadres from the capital gathered with Korean comrades in Beijing at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace tonight to celebrate the national festival of the Korean people – the Fourteenth Anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation.

The flesh-and-blood fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people stirred the hearts of everyone. Workers, cadres, staff members of the Korean Embassy in China attending the evening party, Korean guests in Beijing, and students warmly shook hands and cordially chatted. They congratulated the heroic Korean people on their great festival and the brilliant achievements they have made in socialist construction.

At the celebration party, Wei Chuantong, Vice President of the China-Korea Friendship Association, and Lee Young-ho, the Korean Ambassador to China, delivered speeches full of friendship and passion. After narrating the great victories achieved by the Korean people in construction, Wei Chuantong said in his speech: The Chinese people regard every achievement of the Korean people as their own achievement, from which they have gained infinite encouragement and strength. The Chinese people will never forget the assistance given by the Korean people to the cause of Chinese revolution and construction, and they will always cherish the precious friendship between the Chinese and Korean people as they cherish their own eyes.

Ambassador Lee Young-ho said in his speech: The Korean people deeply realize in their long struggle that the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the reliable guarantee of all our victories. The Korean people will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and do their best to strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation among the people of socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. Ambassador Lee Young-ho also said: In the common struggle for peace and socialism, the Korean people will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people.

After the speeches, recreational programs began.

    新华社平壤14日电　平壤市各界代表八百多人今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场举行盛大集会，庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放十四周年。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成出席了大会。出席大会的还有崔庸健、金一、洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满等朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导人以及各国驻朝鲜外交使节。
    朝鲜内阁副首相金一在大会上作了报告。他说，朝鲜劳动人民用在今年上半年提前两年半完成了第一个五年计划的光辉成就来迎接“八·一五”朝鲜解放十四周年。他说，十四年来，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下进行了英勇的斗争，使祖国的面貌发生了根本的变化，由一个殖民地、半封建社会一跃而进入社会主义社会，由一个落后的农业国转变成为先进的工业—农业国家。
    他说：今年的计划完成以后，朝鲜的工业生产将达到战前的七倍。去年生产了等于1946年产量二倍的三百七十万吨粮食，完全解决了粮食问题。他号召全体朝鲜人民继续快马加鞭，为完成和超额完成今年的计划而努力。
    金一谴责了美帝国主义和李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战协定、把南朝鲜变成原子基地、加剧朝鲜的紧张局势的罪行。他说：由于朝中两国政府采取了主动措施，中国人民志愿军已经在去年全部撤出了朝鲜，美军再也没有任何借口留在南朝鲜，他说，我们再一次坚决要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。
    金一说：我们一再主张朝鲜问题必须在没有外国的干涉下，由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上用和平方法解决。无论美国和李承晚集团如何疯狂阻挠，南北朝鲜全体人民在统一的祖国内过幸福生活的日子即将到来。
    金一说，朝日两国红十字会签署了关于遣送旅日朝侨归国的协议，这是全体朝鲜人民的又一大喜事。这是朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了旅日朝侨早日归国而一贯进行诚意的努力的结果，是全体朝鲜人民斗争的胜利，是人道主义的胜利。朝鲜人民已经作好一切准备，等待着旅日朝侨早日回到祖国怀抱。
    他说，朝鲜非常满意地欢迎关于苏美两国首脑互相访问的公报，这将对缓和国际紧张局势作出巨大贡献。他说：这是苏联为不同制度和平共处和以会谈的方法解决国际问题的和平外交政策的成就，这是陈旧过时的“实力”政策的破产。
    金一在报告时，代表朝鲜人民向朝鲜的解放者——苏联共产党和苏联人民表示热烈的祝贺和感谢。他说：我们永远同苏联人民一起前进。苏联驻朝鲜大使馆临时代办别里申科在大会上接着讲话，他对朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得的光辉成就表示祝贺。他说，苏联人民支持朝鲜人民和平统一自己祖国的斗争。会后，朝鲜著名艺术家演出了精彩艺术节目。
    新华社14日讯　首都工人和机关干部七百多人今晚同在北京的朝鲜同志欢聚在劳动人民文化宫，庆祝朝鲜人民的全民节日——“八·一五”解放十四周年。
    中朝两国人民血肉相连的兄弟情谊激动着每一个人的内心，工人、干部和出席晚会的朝鲜驻华大使馆的工作人员、在北京的朝鲜客人、留学生，热烈握手，亲切欢叙。他们祝贺英雄的朝鲜人民的伟大节日，祝贺朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中获得了辉煌成就。
    在庆祝晚会上，中国朝鲜友好协会副会长魏传统和朝鲜驻华大使李永镐先后作了充满友谊激情的讲话。魏传统在讲话中叙述了朝鲜人民在建设中取得的伟大胜利以后说：中国人民把朝鲜人民的每项成就都看作是自己的成就，从中得到了无限的鼓舞和力量。中国人民永远不会忘记朝鲜人民在中国革命和建设事业中所给予的援助，他们永远像爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护中朝两国人民之间的珍贵友谊。
    李永镐大使在讲话中说：朝鲜人民在长期的斗争中深切体会到，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭的统一和团结，是我们一切胜利的可靠保证。朝鲜人民将继续高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，尽力加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的互助合作。李永镐大使还说：在为和平和社会主义的共同斗争中，朝鲜人民将永远和兄弟的中国人民并肩前进。
    讲话以后，开始游艺节目。
