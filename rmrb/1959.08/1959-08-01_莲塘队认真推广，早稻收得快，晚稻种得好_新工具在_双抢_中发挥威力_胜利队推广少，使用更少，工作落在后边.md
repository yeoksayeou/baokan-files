Changsha Dispatch from our newspaper on the 30th: Diligently promoting and using new tools is an important way to improve work efficiency and solve the current labor shortage in the summer harvest battle. The stark contrast between the Liantang and Victory Brigades of Tanziqiao Commune, Hengnan County, Hunan, which are adjacent to each other, powerfully illustrates this point. The Liantang Brigade, where each full-time laborer has to bear fifteen mu of agricultural work, has a fast “double rush” progress and high quality because the tool reform is tightly grasped and well done. However, the Victory Brigade, where each full-time laborer has to bear nine mu of agricultural work, has a “double rush” progress that is a quarter slower than the Liantang Brigade and the quality is also lower because it has not promoted and used new tools very well.

The main agricultural work of Liantang and Victory Brigades now is harvesting early rice, rushing to plant late rice, and cultivating and managing middle rice, which requires a lot of effort, and the labor force is relatively tight.

Before the early rice was harvested, the Liantang Brigade Party Branch carefully calculated the labor account for the “double rush” period and found that the labor force was not enough. It was then decided to promote several major tools such as rice harvesters, threshing machines, and carts to improve work efficiency. For example, the Jilongjie-style fast harvester is a new type of tool that is about twice as efficient as the old sickle. However, when this tool was promoted among the masses, the masses said that it was highly efficient; at the same time, they also pointed out shortcomings such as knocking off grain, growing inverted ears, messy and untidy rice bundles, and inconvenient bundling, so they were unwilling to use it. Zhang Xuetang, the branch secretary, and four members went deep into the masses separately. On the one hand, they helped the masses build confidence in using new tools, and at the same time, they concentrated the opinions of the masses and assisted the farm tool factory in improving the harvester’s assembly. Then they practiced hard for three days, and sure enough, they became proficient. They could harvest a handful of rice in five to six seconds without dropping grains or growing inverted ears, and the rice bundles were neat, better than those cut with a sickle. They immediately conducted three or four demonstrations by production team and organized the masses to visit the site. At this time, the masses nodded and praised the harvester for being fast and good. At this time, the members were all vying to learn how to use the harvester to cut rice, and more than 80 people in the entire brigade became experts in using the harvester. Fifty-five harvesters were being used in rotation.

The leaders of the Victory Brigade believed that promoting the use of new tools could not solve major problems, and that the main thing to do well in production was to rely on hard work. Under the guidance of this thinking, although the team built forty harvesters and forty-five carts, they were not all used. When they promoted the harvester, they also encountered the same problems as the Liantang Brigade at the beginning. At that time, the brigade party branch only called on everyone to use the harvester, and individual cadres of the brigade also went to the masses to take the lead in using it, but the masses said that the rice he cut was not as good as the sickle, so the team cadre put it away and did not use it. The brigade leaders believed that if the masses were unwilling to use it, they could not "force" it, so most of the harvesters were not used.

Due to the different degrees of promotion and use of tools, the results are also different. The Liantang Brigade, where each full-time laborer bears fifteen mu of farmland, is currently one-quarter faster than the Victory Brigade, where each full-time laborer bears nine mu of farmland, in the progress of rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to plant late rice. In terms of late rice fertilizer, the Liantang Brigade applies thirty more dan of fine fertilizer per mu of land than the Victory Brigade. In terms of field management of middle rice, both teams fought against the drought of more than 1,000 mu of farmland, but the Victory Brigade did not do as solid and meticulous work as the Liantang Brigade in preventing lodging of middle rice and rational irrigation and drainage. More than 1,000 mu of middle rice in the Liantang Brigade grows evenly and strongly, while the Victory Brigade still has a small portion of third-class seedlings.

The Victory Brigade saw the significant role of promoting and using new tools from the facts of the Liantang Brigade. Now the brigade party branch plans to promote the harvesters to eighty units and the threshing machines to twenty units, and to repair the more than seventy single-wheel carts that have been damaged, and strive to use one when there is one, and make the production solid.

    莲塘队认真推广，早稻收得快，晚稻种得好
    新工具在“双抢”中发挥威力
    胜利队推广少，使用更少，工作落在后边
    本报长沙30日电　认真推广和使用新工具是提高工效、解决当前夏收战斗中劳力不足的重要途径。土地毗邻的湖南衡南县谭子桥公社莲塘和胜利两个大队的鲜明对比，有力地说明了这一点。每个全劳力要负担十五亩农活的莲塘大队，由于工具改革抓得紧，做得好，“双抢”进度快，质量高。而每个全劳力负担九亩农活的胜利大队，由于没有很好地推广和使用新工具，
  “双抢”进度比莲塘大队慢四分之一，质量也低。
    莲塘大队和胜利大队当前主要农活是收割早稻、抢插晚稻和中稻的培育管理，工夫多，劳力都比较紧张。
    莲塘大队党总支在早稻开镰收割以前，就细致地盘算了“双抢”这段时间的劳力账，发现劳力不够使用，便决定推广割禾器、打稻机和车子等几种主要工具，用来提高工效，譬如鸡笼街式快速收割器是一种比旧禾镰工效快二倍左右的新式工具。但当这种工具拿到群众中推广时，群众一面说工效高；同时也提出碰掉谷粒、又生倒穗、禾把子散乱不整齐、扮禾不方便等缺点，因此不愿使用。总支书记张雪堂和四个委员分头深入群众，一面帮助群众树立用新工具的信心，同时集中群众的意见，协助农具厂改进了收割器的装制。然后他们苦练了三天，果然熟能生巧，五至六秒钟就能割一手禾，不掉粒，不生倒穗，禾把子整齐，胜过禾镰割的。他们立即以生产队为单位进行三番五次的表演，组织群众现场参观。这时群众都点头称赞收割器又快又好。这时社员都争着学用收割器割禾，全大队有八十多人成了使用收割器能手，五十五部收割器被轮流争着使用。
    胜利大队的领导上认为推广使用新工具解决不了大问题，搞好生产主要还是靠苦干。在这种思想指导下，全队虽搞了四十部收割器和四十五部车子，也没全用起来。他们在推广收割器时，一开头也碰到了像莲塘大队同样的问题。当时，大队党总支只号召大家使用收割器，大队有个别干部也到群众中去带头使用，但是群众说他割的禾还不如镰子割的好，这个队干部也就收起来不用了。大队领导上认为群众不愿意用就不能“勉强”，所以收割器大部分未用起来。
    由于工具的推广和使用的程度不同，结果也不一样。每个全劳力负担十五亩田农活的莲塘大队，在当前抢收早稻抢插晚稻的进度上，比每个全劳力负担九亩田的胜利大队快四分之一。在晚稻肥料上，莲塘大队要比胜利大队每亩田多下三十担细肥。在中稻田间管理上，两个队都抗了一千多亩田的干旱，但在防止中稻倒伏和合理排灌上，胜利大队不及莲塘大队做的那么扎实细致。莲塘大队一千多亩中稻长得均匀粗壮，胜利大队还有少部分的三类苗。
    胜利大队从莲塘大队的事实中看到了推广使用新工具的重大作用，现在大队党总支打算把收割器推广到八十部、打稻机二十部，并且整修好已坏了的七十多部单轮车，力争做到有一件使用一件，把生产搞得扎扎实实。　（周荣）
