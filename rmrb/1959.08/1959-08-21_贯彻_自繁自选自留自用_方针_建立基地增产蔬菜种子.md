Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce recently held a vegetable seed symposium in Beijing, requiring all regions to further implement the policy of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use" as the main approach, supplemented by adjustments, to establish vegetable seed propagation bases and vigorously increase vegetable seed production.

Representatives from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, Beijing, and related counties, cities, and communes attended the symposium. According to reports, significant achievements have been made in vegetable seed work in various regions. Due to sufficient vegetable seed preparation, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces have more than doubled their autumn vegetable planting area compared to last year and have also supported other provinces with over 340,000 jin of vegetable seeds.

The meeting pointed out that breeding vegetable seeds is an important condition for completing and overfulfilling vegetable production tasks. To ensure that vegetable production receives a sufficient quantity of high-quality seeds, all regions must take practical measures to strengthen vegetable seed production. Every county, city, and people's commune should strive to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetable seeds in the shortest possible time and have a certain amount of reserve seeds to replant in case of natural disasters. To carry out the necessary adjustment work, all provinces, cities, and major vegetable production areas should promptly establish vegetable seed propagation bases, providing strong support in terms of technology and production material supplies, and strive to manage the seed bases well to obtain a certain quantity of commodity seeds from these bases. In addition, strict seed selection, improved seed collection techniques, and improved seed quality are also required.

The meeting called on all regions to comprehensively arrange the current autumn vegetable seed production and to prepare for next year's spring and summer vegetable seeds as soon as possible.

    贯彻“自繁自选自留自用”方针
    建立基地增产蔬菜种子
    据新华社20日讯　农业部和商业部最近在北京召开蔬菜种子座谈会，要求各地进一步贯彻“自繁、自选、自留、自用”为主，辅之以调剂的方针，建立蔬菜种子繁殖基地，大力增产蔬菜种子。
    参加座谈会的有河北、山东、河南、辽宁、北京等五个省市和有关县、市、公社代表。根据汇报，各地蔬菜种子工作都取得了很大成绩。河北、山东、河南等省由于菜种准备充分，今年秋菜播种面积比去年增加一倍多，而且支援外省三十四万多斤蔬菜种子。
    会议指出，繁育蔬菜种子是完成和超额完成蔬菜生产任务的重要条件。为了使蔬菜生产得到数量充足、品质优良的种子，各地要采取切实措施，加强蔬菜种子的生产，每一个县市，每一个人民公社都应当在最短期间力争蔬菜种子自给，并且要有一定数量的储备种子，以备遭受自然灾害时补种。为了作好必要的调剂工作，各省市和蔬菜各产区应当抓紧建立蔬菜种子繁殖基地，在技术和生产资料供应等方面给予大力支援，努力把种子基地经营好，以便从这些基地取得一定数量的商品种子。此外，还要严格选种，改进采种技术，提高种子质量。
    会议要求各地全面安排当前的秋菜种子生产，对明年春菜夏菜种子也要及早作好准备。
