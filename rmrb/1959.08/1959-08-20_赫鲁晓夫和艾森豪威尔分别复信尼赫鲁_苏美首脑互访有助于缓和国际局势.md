    In his letter to Khrushchev, Nehru expressed his belief that the reciprocal visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States were of great importance to world peace. He sincerely hoped that this would lead to a relaxation of tensions and would contribute to future high-level talks and the reaching of agreements.

He said that the Soviet government and all Soviet people were working to achieve this goal.
    Khrushchev then wrote that we highly value your correct understanding of our policy and your efforts to ease international tensions and improve mutual understanding between countries.
    According to a Press Trust of India dispatch from New Delhi, Nehru said in his letter to Eisenhower that he hoped these visits "will promote the cause of world peace and may have a profound impact on easing international tensions." In his reply to Nehru, Eisenhower said, "I hope that these visits will contribute to a better understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union and promote the cause of peace by easing international tensions."

    The statement said that expressing the wishes of all Soviet peace supporters, we sincerely hope that Khrushchev's visit to the United States will achieve great success. The Soviet people will be happy to see U.S. President Eisenhower in their country. The Soviet people hope that this meeting will help promote mutual understanding between the two most powerful countries in the world and between all countries.
    The statement said that we hope that the meeting between the head of the Soviet government and the U.S. President will pave the way for the rapid resolution of mature issues, the convening of high-level conferences, and the holding of effective disarmament talks. Some initial major steps on the road to international cooperation were originally determined by the will of the people of all countries. The people of all countries should help national leaders reach rational agreements, abandon the "Cold War," and move towards a new era of true peace.
