Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 12th: The All-India Trade Union Congress issued a statement on the Indian Central Government's action of dissolving the former Kerala government, calling on all democratic people to "condemn this infringement on democracy, condemning its forced overthrow of the legally elected government which won the confidence of the Kerala Legislative Assembly."

The statement pointed out that the reason the former Kerala government was overthrown was because the people of Kerala "elected the Communist Party and its non-party allies to government positions, thereby paving the way for the realization of the demands of the working people."

The All-India Trade Union Congress, which has more than 1,558,000 members, held a working committee meeting in Delhi from August 8th to 10th. The statement issued at the meeting supported the policies adopted by the former Kerala government in safeguarding the interests of workers and peasants. The statement said, "The task of the workers of Kerala now is to strive to safeguard the rights they obtained during the tenure of the previous government, so that the demands that have been realized will not be unduly altered by the President's rule or by vested interest groups that are now restoring their inherent means of oppression and exploitation."

In a resolution on the food situation, the Working Committee expressed serious concern about the current "alarming rise in food prices," as this situation will "harm the living conditions of the working people." It pointed out that the current scarcity of supply and rising prices "can only mean that this crisis is created by hoarders and speculative banking forces aided by rural landlords. And the purpose is to overturn the proposed land reforms."

The committee discussed the issue of strengthening domestic worker unity. In a resolution, it expressed regret over the divisive policies pursued by the Indian National Trade Union Congress in those industries and sectors where unified federations exist. The committee decided to strengthen its work among plantation workers and discussed the steps to be taken to organize an All-India Plantation Workers' Federation.

　　全印工会大会就喀拉拉邦政府被解散发表声明
　　谴责印度政府对民主的侵犯
    新华社新德里12日电　全印工会大会就印度中央政府解散前喀拉拉邦政府的行动发表声明，呼吁一切拥护民主的人民群众“谴责这种对民主的侵犯，谴责它强迫推翻获得喀拉拉邦立法会议信任的合法当选的政府。”
    声明指出，前喀拉拉邦政府所以被推翻，是因为喀拉拉邦人民“选出共产党和它的无党派同盟者担任政府职位，从而为实现劳动人民的要求铺平了道路。”
    拥有一百五十五万八千多会员的全印工会大会从8月8日到10日在德里举行了工作委员会会议。会议发表的声明支持前喀拉拉邦政府在维护工农群众利益方面所采取的政策。声明说，“喀拉拉邦工人现在的任务是努力维护他们在上届政府执政期间所获得的权利，使已经实现的要求将不会受到总统的统治或者现在正在恢复他们固有的压迫和剥削手段的既得利益集团的不正当的变动。”
    工作委员会在关于粮食情况的决议中，对目前“粮食价格的惊人上涨”表示严重的忧虑，因为这种情况将“损害劳动人民的生活条件”。它指出，目前供应的稀少和价格的上涨“只能意味着，这种危机是得到乡村地主帮助的囤积居奇者和投机的银行势力制造出来的。而其目的是要推翻关于土地改革的建议。”
    委员会讨论了加强国内工人团结的问题。它在一项决议中对印度全国工会大会在那些存在着统一联合会的工业和行业中执行的分裂政策表示遗憾。委员会决定加强它在种植园工人中间的工作，并且讨论了组织全印种植园工人联合会所要采取的步骤。
