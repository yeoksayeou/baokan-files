Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 9th: A communique issued here today by the Vietnamese Central Flood Control Committee stated that the floods in all rivers in northern Vietnam have begun to recede. The communique said that the flood threat along the banks of these rivers has been overcome by the tremendous efforts made by the people in these areas under the close leadership of the local Labor Party and government committees.

Although this year's dike reinforcement project was much larger than last year and had been completed on time, the recent sudden heavy rain caused the river waters to rise sharply and threatened many dikes.

The communique said that the water level of the Cau River had risen to 11.25 meters, the highest level in the past fifty years.

The communique said that more than 4,500 people, including government workers and soldiers, rushed to the dangerous sections that night. After fighting the flood, by dawn, they had raised a five-kilometer-long section of the dike by one meter, thus saving tens of thousands of hectares of autumn crops.

The communique said that although the danger has passed, the people on both sides of the river are still continuing to reinforce the dikes and are constantly prepared to deal with any possible rise in water levels. (Attached picture)

The large number of water conservancy projects built by the Vietnamese people have played a huge role in flood control and drought resistance.

　　全民奋起搏斗　干部亲自上堤
　　越南人民战胜特大洪水
    新华社河内9日电　越南中央防洪委员会今天在这里发表的一项公报说，越南北方全境各河流的洪水已经开始减退。公报说，这些河流沿岸的洪水威胁，已经被这些地区的人民在当地劳动党和政府委员会的密切领导下所作的巨大努力战胜了。
    虽然今年的堤岸加固工程比去年要大得多，并且已经及时完成；但是最近突如其来的猛烈的暴雨使各河河水暴涨，并且使许多堤防遭到威胁。
    公报说，桥河的水位曾经上涨到11.25米，是过去五十年来最高的水位。
    公报说，包括政府工作人员和军人在内的四千五百余人当天晚上赶到了危险地段。经过与洪水搏斗，到天亮的时候，他们把五公里长的一段堤防，加高了一米。因而挽救了数以千公顷计的秋季作物。
    公报说，虽然危险已经过去，但是沿河两岸的人民仍旧在继续加固堤防，并且经常准备对付任何可能的水位上涨。（附图片）
