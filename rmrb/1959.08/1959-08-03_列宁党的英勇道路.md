Give us an organization of revolutionaries, and we will turn Russia upside down!
--V.I. Lenin

Lenin's inspiring words are filled with a profound belief in the revolutionary and creative power of the working class: the working class can transform the motherland and lead it onto a broad path to a bright future—communism. This sentence can serve as the epigraph to the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" textbook recently published. Lenin's prediction was made more than fifty years ago in his famous work "What Is to Be Done?" At that time, the foundation of the Marxist revolutionary party of the working class, that is, a new type of party, was being laid in Russia. Lenin gradually established, on the basis of solid Marxism, an organization of revolutionaries absolutely loyal to the working class and the cause of communism. He tempered it in the fire of class struggle and turned it into a mass party—a fighting party of millions of world transformers.

The new "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" elaborates on the heroic path of the Communist Party from the day it was founded to the present, and summarizes its great historical experience. Chapter by chapter, the new book progressively reveals the epic of the heroic struggles waged by the Communist Party in various historical stages.

The book says: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, established and nurtured by the great Lenin, has gone through a historical path that no other party in the world has experienced. This is a path of heroic struggle, severe trials, and world-historic victories for the working class over the past fifty years, a path of socialist victory."

The Communist Party, which started from small Marxist groups active in Russia at the end of the nineteenth century, has now become a great force leading a powerful socialist country, and enjoys high prestige in the international communist and workers' movement.

Our party entered the stage of historical struggle as a new type of party, a revolutionary party of the working class, taking the most advanced revolutionary doctrines of the great founders of scientific communism, leaders of the international proletariat, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as the basis of all its activities. The founder of the Communist Party, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, emphasized that Russia truly experienced unheard-of pain and sacrifice for half a century, demonstrated unprecedented revolutionary heroism, and engaged in exploration and research, and practical testing with incredible efforts and selfless spirit. It went through disappointment, examined the reasons for success and failure, referred to European experience, and finally obtained Marxism, the only correct revolutionary theory. In the course of the struggle, our party went through the storms of three revolutions, summarized the experience of the international workers' movement, relied on extensive international connections, creatively applied and developed Marxism, and confidently moved forward along a path that had never been experienced, fulfilling the role of the vanguard in the struggle for the cause of communism. The Party defended Marxism, protecting it from attacks by open and covert enemies of communism, and from various opportunists and revisionists.

Lenin comprehensively enriched the theories of Marx and Engels and raised it to a new and highest stage. He armed the Party and the working class with this ever-victorious theory to carry out the struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution and the building of communism. The textbook points out that Leninism is the continuation and development of Marxism, the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, the Marxism of the era of socialist construction and communist construction in the Soviet Union and the era of the emergence and development of the world socialist system, the Marxism of the era of mankind's transition from capitalism to communism.

The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great victories achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party clearly prove the invincible power of Marxist-Leninist thought and the creative power of the working class. The working class has completed the historical mission of revolutionarily transforming capitalist society into socialist society. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the working class and the masses of the people in huge theoretical, political, and organizational activities. As a result, socialist society was built for the first time in history. Lenin said that we must turn Russia upside down. Now this sentence has been realized. Our motherland has overcome long-term backwardness and has become an advanced and powerful socialist country. The great Marxist-Leninist principles on building socialism and communism have not only been elucidated in theory but have also been successfully realized in practice and confirmed by historical experience.

Now the Soviet people are closely united around their beloved Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee, and are realizing the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the grand program for the comprehensive development of communist society.

The need to publish a textbook on the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" has long been ripe. In the summary report of the CPSU Central Committee to the 20th Party Congress, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, in determining the tasks in ideological work, said: The glorious history of our party must continue to be used as the most important material for our education of cadres. Therefore, it is necessary to write a popular, fact-based Marxist textbook on the history of the Party, which scientifically summarizes our Party's world-historic experience in the struggle for communism, and narrates it up to the present. Following the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Central Committee of the Party, the authors collectively compiled this new textbook on the history of the CPSU.

The new edition of the CPSU History textbook divides the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into two main periods.

The textbook points out that the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is divided in two main periods. The first period was the period of struggle to overthrow the Tsarist autocracy and capitalism, and to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. The second period started from the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. At that time the working class formed an alliance with the poor peasants, seized political power in the country, and our party became the ruling party. This is a period of more than forty years of heroic struggle by the Party and the people to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, a period of the socialist victory of world historical significance and a gradual transition to communism.

The new "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" has a total of eighteen chapters, as well as a preface and conclusion. Its structure and periodization are different from previous party history textbooks and teaching materials. Lenin's instructions in "Left-Wing" Communism: an Infantile Disorder" and other works are the basis for the periodization of the Party's history before 1923. In later periods, the history of the CPSU is divided according to the main stages of socialist construction in our country.

In previous party history textbooks, the first chapter usually talked about the period from 1883 to 1901. Different from this, in the new book, the first chapter talks about the events up to 1894. Therefore, the new book particularly emphasizes the beginning of the Leninist stage in the development of Marxism, and Lenin's struggle to establish a Marxist revolutionary party of the working class in Russia. As everyone knows, the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class" established by Lenin in St. Petersburg was the germ of this revolutionary party. The new book analyzes Lenin's early works and his revolutionary struggles to establish a Marxist party more comprehensively.

The exposition of the question of the establishment of the Bolshevik Party in the new book has great significance in principle. Everyone knows that the "A Short History of the CPSU(B)" published in 1938 said that the Bolshevik Party only began to form at the Prague Conference in 1912. This statement is contrary to historical facts. According to Lenin's famous instructions, the new book always emphasizes that Bolshevism has existed as a political thought and as a party since 1903, that is, since the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. It was the Second Congress that laid the foundation for a new type of party—the revolutionary party of Marxism-Leninism. And the significance of the Prague Party Congress lies first of all in the fact that the Bolsheviks carried out an irreconcilable struggle against the Mensheviks, and expelled the Mensheviks, these traitors to the revolutionary cause, from the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. Lenin wrote to Gorky when telling him about the results of the Prague Congress: "No matter how the liquidator villains mess things up, we have finally re-established the Party and its Central Committee."

In the period before the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party was under the difficult conditions of underground work, and carried out an irreconcilable struggle against the enemies of Marxism—Populists and Economists, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, against various nationalists, and against opportunism and revisionism on the international stage. In these struggles, the Party explored extremely important ideological, political and organizational questions, and fixed the basic, guiding Marxist-Leninist principles in its programmatic documents, in the resolutions of the Congresses and conferences, in Lenin's works, and in the decisions of the Central Committee. The Party formulated the theory of the Marxist revolutionary party and its organizational principles, the new theory of socialist revolution adapted to the era of imperialism, and the strategy and tactics of revolutionary struggle. The Party carried out a persistent struggle for the leadership of the proletariat, the establishment of an alliance between the working class and the peasantry, the unity of the workers’ movement and the victory of the principles of proletarian internationalism, the liberation of oppressed nations and attracting them to the side of the proletariat. The Bolshevik Party was a model for defending the purity of Marxism and creatively developing Marxism.

The new book depicts the scene of selfless struggle for the establishment of a Marxist party in Russia, and lists the names of many people. These people participated with Lenin in establishing the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class," founded the first Marxist newspaper "Iskra," and prepared the Second Congress of the Party (at which Bolshevism began to form). In this struggle, professional revolutionaries - Lenin's students - were cultivated: I.V. Babushkin, N.E. Bauman, R.S. Zemlyachka, M.I. Kalinin, N.K. Krupskaya, G.M. Krzhizhanovsky, M.M. Litvinov, G.I. Petrovsky, M.E. Pyatnitsky, Ya.M. Sverdlov, J.V. Stalin, E.D. Stasova, S.G. Shaumyan and many others.

Following the theories of Marxism-Leninism, the Bolshevik Party waged an unswerving struggle for the interests of the working class and all the laboring people, constantly strengthened its ties with the masses, and supported and developed the revolutionary creativity of the working class, which created outstanding forms such as the Soviets in the struggle for their own liberation. The Party guided the working people of our country through the great revolutionary storms of 1905 and 1917; the Party went to the international stage as the most revolutionary party, and it carried out huge work to unite all the revolutionary forces of the world workers' movement under the banner of Marxist internationalism. Under the wise leadership of its fighting vanguard and tested leader, the working class and laboring people of our country completed the victorious Great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history—an era of the victory of socialism and communism.

Made an objective and fair assessment of Stalin's merits and demerits, and pointed out that the shortcomings arising from personal superstition cannot change the profound democratic nature and the true popular nature of the Soviet system.

The victory of the October Revolution led our country onto a new, unexplored path of historical development—from capitalism to socialism. In this situation, the role of the Party as the leading and inspiring force for organizing the people to build a new socialist society has been immeasurably enhanced. Therefore, it is quite natural that the new book uses two-thirds of its length (eleven chapters) to narrate the period after the October Revolution. This period is full of events of world historical significance, and this is a period when the Party unfolded its activities in all aspects.

The new book devotes a chapter (Chapter 8) to "The Party's Struggle to Develop the Socialist Revolution and Consolidate Soviet Power" (October 1917 to 1918), which is of great significance. In the old book, these issues were studied together with the question of preparing for the October Revolution in one chapter. The chapter structure of the new book can more accurately show that the October Revolution was a great turning point in the history of the Party and the Soviet people, and the October Revolution had world historical significance; the activities of the Party during the period of foreign armed intervention and the Civil War are also more fully elaborated.

The events of the 1930s are periodized in a new way. Chapter 12 (1929 to 1932) describes the activities of the Party during the socialist all-out offensive and the establishment of the collective farm system. Chapter 13 (1933 to 1937) describes the Party's struggle to complete the socialist transformation of the national economy and to strive for the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union (1933 to 1937). This periodization is in line with the actual process of socialist construction in our country. Because the first five-year plan was completed and a powerful industry was established, and because of the victory of the collective farm system in the countryside, the task before the Party in 1933 was to complete the socialist transformation of the national economy.

"A Short History of the CPSU(B)" narrates the history of the Party up to 1937. A very important point in the new book is that the Party's activities are narrated up to the present. The new book explains in detail the huge theoretical and organizational work carried out by the Party in recent years; the textbook finally narrates the historic resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, which formulated a program for the comprehensive development of communist society.

In the period after the October Revolution, the Communist Party theoretically explored and practically solved the most complex problems of socialist construction. The problems of prime importance were: the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the elimination of the exploiting classes, the establishment of new socialist economic forms, national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and the realization of the cultural revolution. In a multi-ethnic country, solving the ethnic question and strengthening the friendship of all ethnic groups occupied an important position in the Party's activities.

The new book closely combines the development of major events in international life to expound on socialist construction and the Party's activities in our country. Socialist construction in the Soviet Union was carried out under the conditions of hostile capitalist encirclement. The Party and the people overcame huge difficulties and heroically defended the achievements of socialism. In this heroic struggle, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people received the support of the fraternal communist and workers' parties and the working people of the world, who regarded the first socialist country as a powerful fortress of peace and social progress. The new book widely narrates the struggles of the fraternal communist and workers' parties, and lists the names of outstanding activists of the international communist movement and leaders of socialist camp countries.

The textbook's entire narration of the history of the CPSU is based on the Marxist-Leninist principles of historicism and the scientific principle of party spirit, and is based on a materialist interpretation of social phenomena. The textbook closely combines the conditions for the development of events to examine the events.

As everyone knows, "A Short History of the CPSU(B)" provided great help to Party cadres and all Soviet people in studying Party history. The new book absorbs all the useful things contained in the "Short History" that are in line with historical truth and Marxist-Leninist methodology, and removes one-sided expositions made due to the adoption of the position of personal superstition.

The new book examines the most important theoretical questions from the perspective of development, according to Lenin's works, the Congresses and conferences of the Party, and the resolutions of the Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee, according to the activities of the Party and the people, and their extremely rich experience in the struggle to build socialism and communism. The textbook consistently runs through this idea: our Party closely combines practice with the construction of communist society to develop theory; Marxist-Leninist theory illuminates the path for practice; the Party, both in the past and now, relies on the collective wisdom of the people and formulates its policies based on the scientific analysis of phenomena in social development.

The book deeply and comprehensively elaborates on the great role of the great leader and teacher of the working people, the founder of our Party and the Soviet state—V.I. Lenin, elucidates many of Lenin's works, and points out their significance in the development of Marxism and the development of scientific communism. It pays special attention to Lenin's formulation of the plan for socialist construction and communist construction in the Soviet Union. It uses concrete historical facts to illustrate the decisive role of the people in history, and illustrates the Communist Party's leadership and organizational activities. The invincible strength of the Marxist-Leninist Party lies in its inseparable close ties with the working class and the masses of the people; the strength of the people lies in their unity around the Party.

The book points out the positive revolutionary activities of the Leninist core of the Party in the struggle against the Trotskyites, against right-leaning opportunists, against various nationalist groups and other capitulationists, in the struggle for the victory of the socialist revolution, and in the struggle to build socialism. The book points out such important activists of the Party who actively struggled to realize the Party's line, such as A.A. Andreyev, K.E. Voroshilov, F.E. Dzerzhinsky, A.A. Zhdanov, M.I. Kalinin, S.M. Kirov, S.V. Kossior, V.V. Kuibyshev, A.I. Mikoyan, G.K. Ordzhonikidze, I.G. Petrovsky, J.V. Stalin, M.V. Frunze, N.S. Khrushchev, N.M. Shvernik, E.M. Yaroslavsky, etc.

The book objectively and justly elaborates on the role of J.V. Stalin in the history of the CPSU and the history of the Soviet state, in the international workers' movement, and elaborates on his struggle against anti-Party groups and in defense of Leninism, and in the struggle for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization. J.V. Stalin did a lot of useful work for the Soviet state, for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the workers’ movement, and his activities are linked to the realization of the great socialist transformation of the Soviet Union. The book also talks about the facts that occurred in his later years, which brutally violated the Leninist norms of Party life, violated the socialist legal system and the Soviet democratic system, and lists the many measures taken by the Party to overcome the consequences of personal superstition after the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The book points out that the errors and shortcomings arising from personal superstition hindered the development of Soviet society, caused great losses to Soviet society, and hindered the play of the creativity and initiative of the masses. However, no matter how the enemies of socialism slander, these errors and shortcomings cannot change and have not changed the profound democratic nature and the true popular nature of the Soviet system. The textbook points out: "The essence of the Party's criticism of personal superstition lies in eliminating the harmful consequences of this superstition, so as to consolidate the socialist positions, rather than denying in general J.V. Stalin's positive role in the Party and state life."

In the years of the severe test of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people led by the Communist Party played a decisive role in destroying the forces of fascism. Whether in the war period or in the period of peaceful construction, the Party has been the leading force and guiding force of the Soviet people. In the chapter narrating the Great Patriotic War, the book reveals the huge work carried out by the Party in mobilizing all forces to defeat the enemy, and describes the unprecedented heroic deeds of our heroic armed forces and all the Soviet people, who defended the historical achievements of socialism and defended the freedom, honor and independence of the motherland.

The victory of the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War has great international significance. The destruction of the fascist forces in World War II and the victory of the people’s liberation struggle changed the balance of socialist forces and capitalist forces on the international scale. Many countries in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist system, and the working people of these countries established a people’s democratic system under the leadership of their Marxist-Leninist parties and began to embark on the road of building socialism. The establishment of the world socialist system is the main feature of our era. Now, the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, the People’s Republic of Albania, the People’s Republic of Bulgaria, the People’s Republic of Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People’s Republic, the People’s Republic of Poland, the People’s Republic of Romania, and the Czechoslovak Republic, united in the powerful socialist camp, form a great invincible force in the struggle for the victory of communism, for peace, democracy and social progress.

The book comprehensively elaborates on the consistent Soviet policy of peaceful diplomacy pursued by the Communist Party. The foundation of this policy is the principle of peaceful coexistence of two different social systems proposed by Lenin, and the development and consolidation of friendship and fraternal cooperation with the people of all countries in the powerful socialist camp.

The last three chapters of the textbook narrate the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the post-war period.

The concluding three chapters of the textbook narrate the history of the Communist Party in the post-war period. The book emphasizes that many major events occurred in the last five-year plan, in terms of the development of life in the Soviet Union, in terms of the activities of the Party, in terms of the Party's struggle to build a communist society in the Soviet Union, and to maintain and consolidate peace. The book points out that this period is one of the most important periods in the history of the CPSU in terms of the significance of political and economic measures, in terms of the scale of the Party's creative activities, and in terms of the level of social activeness of the masses.

It was during these years that the Soviet state, under the leadership of the Party, unfolded a strong, goal-oriented struggle in foreign policy to ease international tensions, prevent a new world war, further consolidate the Soviet Union's international status, and consolidate the entire socialist camp. In these years, our Party vigorously strengthened the unity of the international communist movement; consolidated comradely ties and cooperation with the fraternal communist and workers' parties of other countries based on Marxist-Leninist principles, and strengthened the friendly unity of socialist countries.

During this period, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, implemented huge political and economic measures in the country to further consolidate the Soviet social system and state system, vigorously develop industry, first of all heavy industry, rapidly develop agriculture, develop science and culture, and improve the people's material welfare. The Party transformed all of its work according to Leninist principles and the norms of Party life, creatively applying these principles and norms to new conditions, and according to the extremely rich experience accumulated, eradicated everything that hindered the progress of Soviet society and was incompatible with the Leninist spirit. The exposure of Beria, the irreconcilable enemy of the Party and the people and a political adventurer, was of great significance for consolidating the Soviet system. The Party resolutely opposed personal superstition and eradicated the consequences of personal superstition in all aspects of Soviet social life. These years were characterized by an unprecedented upsurge in the political and labor activism of the masses, and the entire Soviet people were more closely united around the Communist Party.

The 20th Congress of the Party was an extremely important event in the life of the Soviet Union and the Party, and in the international communist movement. This Congress determined the specific tasks of communist construction in the Soviet Union, pointed out the path for the development and consolidation of the Soviet system, and put forward and solved in a new way many fundamental and principled questions in the development of the modern international situation. The resolutions of the 20th Congress had a huge impact on all aspects of the Party's life and on the development of Soviet society along the path of communism. The book points out that the Soviet people have achieved great achievements in all aspects of social life after implementing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Party. According to the resolutions of the 20th Congress, the Party and its Leninist Central Committee, accepting the suggestion of Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, formulated and implemented many major and truly revolutionary measures, such as reforming the form of management of industry and construction, reforming machine and tractor stations and further consolidating the collective farm system, and improving the national education system.

In the period after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the smashing of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin and Shepilov has great principled significance. This group, using the most despicable methods of factional struggle, attempted to undermine the unity of the Party and lead the Party and the state away from the Leninist path. This group opposed all the most important measures taken by the Party to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress; opposed those measures that enabled us to achieve great achievements in developing industry and agriculture, and improving people's welfare, and in foreign policy enabled us to ease international tensions and consolidate the cause of peace.

The factional activities of the anti-Party group were exposed in a timely manner; this small group of splitters was ideologically and politically crushed, and was abandoned by the Soviet people from their path. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, members and alternate members of the Presidium of the Central Committee, secretaries of the Central Committee A.B. Aristov, N.I. Belyaev, L.I. Brezhnev, A.I. Kirichenko, F.R. Kozlov, A.I. Mikoyan, N.A. Mukhitdinov, P.N. Pospelov, M.A. Suslov, E.A. Furtseva, N.M. Shvernik, and members of the Central Committee N.G. Ignatov, O.V. Kuusinen, D.S. Korotchenko, J.E. Kalnberzin, A.P. Kirilenko, A.N. Kosygin, K.T. Mazurov, V.P. Mzhavanadze, N.V. Podgorny, D.S. Polyansky and others defended the general line of the Party, defended the line stipulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU, resolutely opposed the anti-Party group, and gave a fatal blow to this group's activities to attack the Leninist line of the Party. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU held in June 1957 considered that the activities of the anti-Party group were incompatible with the Leninist principles of the Communist Party. The Party and all the Soviet people unanimously approved the resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee.

The textbook uses a large amount of space to summarize the activities of the Communist Party in the forty years of Soviet power. The people of all ethnic groups in our country and all progressive mankind solemnly celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This was a demonstration of the socialist forces of the world, and a true triumph of the invincible Marxist-Leninist thought. The conference of fraternal communist and workers' parties convened in Moscow to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution declared in its programmatic documents: the main content of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism started by the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia.

The book has a chapter devoted to narrating the entry of the Soviet Union into the period of comprehensive development of communist society, narrating the formulation of the grand program for communist construction, and narrating the historic 21st Congress of the CPSU, which determined the main tasks of the Party at the present stage. In the resolutions unanimously passed at the 21st Congress of the Party, it agreed with the outlines and report of Comrade N.S. Khrushchev and approved the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965. The seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union is the most important part of the program for building a communist society formulated by the Party, and is a decisive stage in establishing the material and technical foundation of communism.

The people of all ethnic groups in our country regard the resolutions of the Congress and the seven-year plan as their own cause. The June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee formulated measures to implement the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party and formulated a program for the realization of technological progress in various sectors of the national economy. The nationwide socialist competition that has flourished since the June Plenary Session to strive for the early completion of the seven-year plan shows that the Soviet people are determined to realize the historical resolutions of the Party.

The profound theoretical principles put forward in N.S. Khrushchev's report and the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU are a major contribution to the further development of Marxism-Leninism and the development of the international communist movement. These theoretical principles are: the question of the complete and thorough victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the question of the two stages of communist society and the regularity of socialism growing into communism, the question of the material and technical foundation of communist society, the question of the distribution of material wealth under socialism and under communism, the question of the road of development and approach of the collective farm form of socialist ownership and the form of ownership by the whole people, the question of the socio-political organization in the period of comprehensive development of communist construction, the question of the development of the world socialist system, etc. The 21st Congress of the CPSU emphasized the importance of ideological work in the current period, and pointed out that carrying out communist education for the workers and overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness should become the focus of attention and the focus of work of the Party, Soviet organs, trade unions, the Communist Youth League and other social groups.

The 21st Congress of the CPSU brilliantly demonstrated the unity of the international communist movement on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. The Congress more fully showed that the prestige of the Party is increasing in the Soviet Union and abroad. The entire experience of the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism proves the correctness of one of the most important conclusions of Leninism, that is, the role of the Party will become more and more important in the process of building a communist society.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, in explaining the great role of the Communist Party and the Party's historical victory in the struggle for communism, said: "The Communist Party has shown that it is worthy of the genius of its great organizer and creator Lenin's will and ability."

The history of the CPSU shows that communist ideas have an invincible power; the Party is the vanguard in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism.

The textbook "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" is a major contribution to the works that elucidate Marxist-Leninist thought. It can help us study the path of heroic struggle of our Party and help us arm cadres, communists, and the broad masses with Marxist-Leninist theory.

Writing a scientific work on the history of the CPSU is a major matter, and the entire Party is closely concerned about this matter. In the future, the textbook should continue to be improved continuously: When the book is reprinted, some minor details can be deleted, the narration in individual places can be more precise and more concise, and the writing style of each chapter should strive to be consistent. In the process of communist construction in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the significance of the historical resolutions of the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU will be more and more fully displayed. Therefore, we believe that it is extremely important to continue to revise the chapters narrating the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU so that the great contributions made by our Party in recent years in enriching the theory and practice of communist construction, and in enriching the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism, can be more fully elaborated.

The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union shows the invincible power of communist ideas. Our Party and other fraternal parties are closely united and stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism.

The history of the Communist Party teaches us that the working class can only achieve victory under the leadership of the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party; the transition from capitalism to communism and the successful solution of the tasks of communist construction are only possible on the basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat; in order to smoothly build socialism and communism, all activities of the Party should be guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, should be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, creatively apply theory, thoroughly implement the unity of theory and practice, and conduct an irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideas hostile to communism; adhere to the unity of the working class, which is a necessary condition for the victory of the socialist revolution; conduct an irreconcilable struggle against opportunists, revisionists, compromisers and those who lack confidence; consolidate the unity of the Party based on the ideological principles of Marxism-Leninism; abide by iron discipline, implement the Leninist principle of democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership; constantly consolidate the Party's ties with the masses of the people, boldly expose shortcomings, weaknesses and errors, and carry out principled criticism and self-criticism. The Party defends the fundamental interests of the people building communism, and it is a true patriotic force; the Party always follows the principles of proletarian internationalism in its theoretical and practical activities. The rich experience of the victorious construction of socialism in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries convincingly shows that the path indicated by Marxism-Leninism is the only correct path to achieve the great goal—communism.

Studying the history of the CPSU, studying the victorious path taken by the Party, and studying Marxist-Leninist theory can arm the working people with knowledge of the laws of social development and knowledge of building a communist society. Studying the history of the Party will make the communists and all the people of the Soviet Union feel proud of the Party and the world-historical significance of the victory of the motherland, and will make them willing to dedicate all their strength to the great cause of communist construction. Lenin said when talking about the Communist Party that the Party embodies "the wisdom, honor and conscience of our era"; studying the richest experience of this Party helps to successfully solve the tasks of comprehensively developing communist society.

    “苏联共产党历史”　国家政治书籍出版局1959年出版，共744页。教科书的作者是：苏联科学院通讯院士波诺马列夫（主编）；沃尔科夫教授；历史学副博士沃宁；历史学副博士查依采夫；历史学博士库赤庚；明茨院士；经济学副博士斯列波夫；哲学副博士索保列夫；历史学副博士季莫菲耶夫斯基；苏联科学院通讯院士赫沃斯托夫；历史学博士萨达根。给我们一个革命家组织，我们就能把俄国翻转过来！   ——弗·伊·列宁
    列宁的这句鼓舞人心的话，充满着对工人阶级的革命创造力量的深刻信念：工人阶级能够改造祖国，能够把祖国引上一条通到光明未来——共产主义的广阔道路。这句话可以作为不久以前出版的“苏联共产党历史”教科书的题词。列宁的这个预言，是五十多年以前在他的名著“怎么办？”中说的，那时候，在俄国正在奠定工人阶级的马克思主义革命政党即新型政党的基础。列宁在坚如磐石的马克思主义的基础上逐步地建立了绝对忠实于工人阶级和共产主义事业的革命家组织。他在阶级斗争的烈火中锻炼了它，并把它变成了群众性的政党——千百万改造世界者的战斗的政党。
    新的“苏联共产党历史”，阐述了共产党从它建党之日到现在的英勇道路，概括了它的伟大的历史经验。新书逐章逐页循序渐进地揭示了共产党在各个不同的历史阶段所进行的英勇斗争的史诗。
    书中说：“伟大的列宁所建立和培育的苏联共产党经历了世界上任何其他政党都没有经历过的历史道路。这是五十多年来工人阶级进行英勇斗争、经受严酷考验和取得全世界历史性胜利的道路，社会主义胜利的道路”。
    从十九世纪末在俄国活动的不大的马克思主义小组开始的共产党，目前已经变成了领导强大的社会主义国家的伟大力量，它在国际共产主义运动和工人运动中享有很高的威信。
    我们党作为一个新型政党、工人阶级的革命政党而走上了历史斗争的舞台，它把科学共产主义的伟大奠基人、国际无产阶级的领袖卡尔·马克思和弗里德利希·恩格斯的最先进的革命学说，作为自己的全部活动的基础。共产党的创始人弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁着重指出，俄国在半个世纪期间真正经历了闻所未闻的痛苦和牺牲，表现出空前未有的革命的英勇气魄，以难于置信的努力和舍身忘我的精神来从事探讨研究，从事实际检验，它经受失望，检查成败原因，参照欧洲经验，终于得到了马克思主义这个唯一正确的革命理论。在斗争进程中，我们党经过了三次革命的风暴，概括了国际工人运动的经验，依靠广泛的国际联系，创造性地运用和发展了马克思主义，满怀信心地沿着未曾经历过的道路前进，实现着为共产主义事业而斗争的先锋队的作用。党捍卫了马克思主义，使它免受公开和隐蔽的共产主义敌人的侵犯，免受各式各样的机会主义者和修正主义者的侵犯。
    列宁全面地丰富了马克思和恩格斯的学说，并且把它提高到新的最高阶段。他用这个百战百胜的学说武装了党和工人阶级，来进行争取社会主义革命胜利和建成共产主义的斗争。教科书指出，列宁主义是马克思主义的继续和发展，是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义，是苏联社会主义建设、共产主义建设时代和世界社会主义体系的产生和发展时代的马克思主义，是人类从资本主义过渡到共产主义时代的马克思主义。
    苏联共产党的历史以及在共产党领导下取得的伟大胜利，明显地证明了马克思列宁主义思想的不可战胜的力量，证明了工人阶级的创造威力。工人阶级完成了把资本主义社会革命地改造为社会主义社会的历史使命。苏联共产党领导工人阶级和人民群众，进行了巨大的理论的、政治的和组织的活动，因此，社会主义社会便在历史上破天荒第一次建成了。列宁说，我们要把俄国翻转过来。现在这句话已经实现了。我们祖国克服了长期落后状态，变成了一个先进的、强大的社会主义国家。伟大的马克思列宁主义关于建设社会主义和共产主义的原则，不仅在理论上得到了阐明，而且在实际上被成功地实现了，被历史的经验证实了。
    现在苏联人民紧密地团结在自己亲爱的共产党和它的列宁式的中央委员会的周围，正在实现着苏共第二十一次代表大会的历史性的决议和全面展开共产主义社会建设的宏伟纲领。
    出版一本“苏联共产党历史”教科书的需要早已成熟了。在苏共中央向党的第二十次代表大会的总结报告中，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在确定思想工作方面的任务时说道：我们党的光荣的历史今后也必须作为我们教育干部的最重要的材料。因此，必须编写一本通俗的、以历史事实为依据的马克思主义的党史教科书，这本书要科学地概括我们党为共产主义而斗争的具有全世界历史性的经验，并且要一直叙述到现在。遵循着苏共第二十次代表大会和党中央的指示，作者们集体编写了这本新的苏共党史教科书。
    新版苏共党史教科书把苏联共产党
    的历史分为两个主要时期
    教科书指出，苏联共产党历史分为两个主要时期。第一个时期是为推翻沙皇专制制度和资本主义制度、为建立无产阶级专政而斗争的时期。第二个时期是从伟大十月社会主义革命胜利开始的。当时工人阶级同贫苦农民结成联盟，在国内掌握了政权，我们党成了执政党。这是党和人民为巩固无产阶级专政进行四十多年英勇斗争的时期，社会主义取得具有全世界历史意义的胜利和向共产主义逐步过渡的时期。
    新版“苏联共产党历史”共十八章，还有序言和结束语。它的结构和分期不同于过去出版的党史教科书和教材。列宁在“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”和其他著作中所作的指示，是1923年以前党史分期的基础。以后时期，苏共党史是按照我国社会主义建设的主要阶段划分的。
    在以前的党史教科书中，第一章通常讲的是从1883年至1901年的时期。与此不同，在新书中，第一章讲到1894年的事件为止。因此，在新书中特别强调指出马克思主义发展中的列宁阶段的开始，以及列宁为在俄国建立工人阶级的马克思主义革命政党的斗争。大家知道，列宁在彼得堡建立的“工人阶级解放斗争协会”是这个革命政党的萌芽。新书比较全面地分析了列宁的早期著作以及他为建立马克思主义政党而进行的革命斗争。
    新书中有关建立布尔什维克党的问题的阐述，具有巨大的原则意义。大家知道，在1938年出版的“联共（布）党史简明教程”中说，布尔什维克党只是在1912年布拉格代表会议上才开始形成。这种说法是违背历史事实的。新书根据列宁的著名指示，始终强调指出布尔什维主义从1903年起，也就是从俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会起，就作为一种政治思潮、作为一个政党而存在了。正是第二次代表大会，奠定了新型政党——马克思列宁主义的革命政党的基础。而布拉格党代表会议的意义，首先是在于，布尔什维克进行了反对孟什维克的不调和的斗争，并把孟什维克这批革命事业的叛徒逐出了俄国社会民主工党。列宁在把有关布拉格代表会议的结果告诉高尔基时曾写道：“不管取消派恶棍怎样捣乱，我们终于把党和它的中央委员会重新建立起来了”。
    在十月革命以前的时期内，布尔什维克党处在地下工作的艰难条件下，同马克思主义的敌人——民粹派和经济派，孟什维克和社会革命党，同各种民族主义分子，同国际舞台上的机会主义和修正主义进行了不可调和的斗争。党在这些斗争中探讨了极其重要的思想问题、政治问题和组织问题，把基本的、指导性的马克思列宁主义原则，在自己的纲领性的文件中，在代表大会、代表会议的决议中，在列宁的著作中，在中央的决定中固定下来了。党制定了关于革命的马克思主义政党及其组织原则的学说、关于适应帝国主义时代的社会主义革命的新理论，以及革命斗争的战略与策略等。党为争取无产阶级领导权、建立工人阶级和农民的联盟、争取工人运动的统一和无产阶级国际主义原则的胜利，为解放被压迫民族并把他们吸引到无产阶级方面来，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。布尔什维克党是捍卫马克思主义的纯洁性和创造性地发展马克思主义的典范。
    新书描绘了在俄国为建立马克思主义政党而进行忘我斗争的情景，列举出许多人的名字。这些人同列宁一道参加建立“工人阶级解放斗争协会”，创办第一个马克思主义的报纸“火星报”，准备党的第二次代表大会（在这次代表大会上开始形成了布尔什维主义）。在这个斗争中培养出了这样一些职业革命家——列宁的学生：伊·瓦·巴布施金、尼·艾·巴乌曼、罗·萨·捷姆里雅奇卡、米·伊·加里宁、娜·康·克鲁普斯卡娅、格·马·克尔日札诺夫斯基、马·马·李维诺夫、格·伊·彼得罗夫斯基、米·叶·皮亚特尼茨基、雅·米·斯维尔德洛夫、约·维·斯大林、叶·德·斯塔索娃、斯·格·邵武勉以及其他许多人。
    布尔什维克党遵循着马克思列宁主义的理论，为工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益进行始终不渝的斗争，不断地加强自己同群众的联系，支持和发展了工人阶级的革命创造，工人阶级在争取自己解放的斗争过程中创造了像苏维埃这样的卓越的形式。党引导我国劳动人民通过了1905年和1917年的革命大风暴；党作为一个最革命的政党而走上了国际舞台，它进行了巨大的工作，把世界工人运动的一切革命力量团结到马克思主义的国际主义旗帜下来。我国工人阶级和劳动人民在自己的战斗先锋队和久经考验的领袖的英明领导下，完成了胜利的伟大十月社会主义革命，这个革命开辟了人类历史上的新纪元——社会主义和共产主义胜利的纪元。
      对斯大林的功过作了客观的公正估
    价，并指出，个人迷信产生的缺点，
    改变不了苏维埃制度的深刻的民主性
    质和真正的人民性质
    十月革命的胜利把我国引上了新的、还没有经历过的历史发展的道路——从资本主义到社会主义的道路。在这种情况下，党作为组织人民建设新的社会主义社会的领导力量和鼓舞力量的作用，无可估量地提高了。因此，十分自然的，新书用了三分之二的篇幅（共十一章）叙述十月革命以后的时期。这个时期充满着具有全世界历史意义的事件，这是党在一切方面展开活动的时期。
    新书辟出“党为发展社会主义革命和巩固苏维埃政权而斗争”（1917年10月至1918年）这一章（第八章）具有重大意义。在旧书里这些问题是同准备十月革命的问题放在一章内来研究的。新书的章节结构可以更确切地表明十月革命是党和苏联人民历史上的伟大转折点，十月革命具有全世界历史意义；党在外国武装干涉和国内战争时期的活动也得到了更充分的阐述。
    有关三十年代的事件是按照新的方式来分期的。第十二章（1929至1932年）叙述在社会主义全线进攻和建立集体农庄制度时期党的活动。第十三章（1933至1937年）叙述党为完成国民经济社会主义改造和争取社会主义在苏联的胜利（1933至1937年）而斗争。这样的分期符合我国社会主义建设的实际进程。由于完成了第一个五年计划和建立了强大的工业，并且由于集体农庄制度在农村的胜利，1933年摆在党面前的任务便是完成国民经济的社会主义改造。
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”叙述党的历史到1937年为止。新书中非常重要的一点是，对党的活动一直叙述到现在。新书详细地说明近几年内党所进行的巨大的理论工作和组织工作；教科书最后叙述到制定全面展开共产主义社会建设纲领的苏共第二十一次代表大会的历史性决议。
    在十月革命以后的时期内，共产党在理论上探讨了并在实际上解决了社会主义建设的最复杂的问题。具有首要意义的问题是：实现无产阶级专政，消灭剥削阶级，建立新的社会主义经济形式，国家工业化，农业集体化，以及实现文化革命等问题。在一个多民族国家里，解决民族问题和加强各族人民的友谊，这在党的活动中占有重要地位。
    新书密切结合着国际生活中的重大事件的发展来阐述我国社会主义建设和党的活动。苏联社会主义建设是在敌对的资本主义包围的条件下进行的。党和人民克服了巨大的困难，英勇地保卫了社会主义的成果。在这个英勇的斗争中苏联共产党和苏联人民得到了兄弟共产党和工人党以及全世界劳动人民的支持，他们把第一个社会主义国家看作是和平与社会进步的强大堡垒。新书广泛地叙述了兄弟共产党和工人党的斗争，列举出国际共产主义运动的卓越活动家和社会主义阵营国家领导人的名字。
    教科书对苏共党史的全部叙述，是以马克思列宁主义的历史主义原则和科学的党性原则为基础的，是以唯物主义地解释社会现象为依据的。教科书密切地结合着事件发展的条件来考察事件。
    大家知道，“联共（布）党史简明教程”对党的干部和全体苏联人民学习党史，曾给予很大的帮助。新书吸收了“简明教程”中所包含的符合于历史真实和马克思列宁主义方法论的一切有益的东西，去除了由于采取个人迷信的立场而作的片面阐述。
    新书对最重要的理论问题是从发展中来考察的，是根据列宁的著作、党的代表大会、代表会议以及党中央全会的决议来考察的，是根据党和人民的活动以及他们为建立社会主义和共产主义而进行的斗争的极其丰富的经验来考察的。教科书始终如一地贯穿着这样一种思想：我们党密切地结合实际、结合共产主义社会的建设来发展理论；马克思列宁主义理论为实践照亮道路；党不论过去和现在，都是依靠人民的集体智慧，依据对社会发展中的现象的科学的分析来制定自己的政策的。
    书中深入而全面地阐明劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师、我们党和苏维埃国家的创始人——弗·伊·列宁的伟大作用，阐明列宁的许多著作并指出它们在发展马克思主义、发展科学共产主义方面的意义。它特别注意列宁制定苏联社会主义建设和共产主义建设的计划。它用具体历史事实说明人民群众在历史上的决定性的作用，说明共产党的领导活动和组织活动。马克思列宁主义党的战无不胜的力量在于它同工人阶级、同人民群众保持不可分的密切联系；人民的力量则在于他们团结在党的周围。
    书中指出了党的列宁主义核心在反对托洛茨基分子、反对右倾机会主义分子、反对各种民族主义集团和其他投降主义分子的斗争中，在争取社会主义革命胜利、争取建立社会主义的斗争中的积极的革命活动。书中指出党的这样一些为实现党的路线而积极进行斗争的重要活动家，如安·安·安德列耶夫、克·叶·伏罗希洛夫、费·艾·捷尔任斯基、安·亚·日丹诺夫、米·伊·加里宁、谢·米·基洛夫、斯·维·柯西奥尔、瓦·弗·古比雪夫、阿·伊·米高扬、格·康·奥尔忠尼启则、伊·盖·彼得罗夫斯基、约·维·斯大林、米·瓦·伏龙芝、尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、尼·米·什维尔尼克、叶·米·雅罗斯拉夫斯基等等。
    书中客观而公正地阐述了约·维·斯大林在苏共历史上和苏维埃国家历史上、在国际工人运动中的作用，阐述他为反对反党集团和保卫列宁主义、争取国家工业化和农业集体化而进行的斗争。约·维·斯大林为苏维埃国家、为苏联共产党和工人运动做了很多有益的工作，他的活动是同实现苏联伟大的社会主义改造相联系的。书中同时也谈到在他的晚年发生的，粗暴地破坏党内生活的列宁主义准则、破坏社会主义法制和苏维埃民主制度的事实，并且列举苏共第二十次代表大会以后党为克服个人迷信的后果所采取的许多措施。书中指出，个人迷信所产生的错误和缺点，阻碍了苏联社会的发展，造成了苏联社会的重大损失，妨碍了群众的创造性和主动性的发挥。可是，不管社会主义的敌人怎样胡说八道，这种错误和缺点，不能改变而且也没有改变苏维埃制度的深刻的民主性质和真正的人民性质。教科书指出：“党对个人迷信的批判的实质，是在于消除这种迷信的有害的后果，从而巩固社会主义的阵地，而不是笼统地否定约·维·斯大林在党和国家生活中的积极作用”。
    在伟大卫国战争的严峻考验的年代中，共产党所领导的苏联人民在摧毁法西斯主义的力量方面，起了决定性的作用。不论在战争时期和和平建设时期，党都是苏联人民的领导力量和指导力量。在叙述伟大卫国战争的一章里，揭示了党在动员一切力量击败敌人方面所进行的巨大工作，描述了我们英勇的武装力量和苏联全体人民史无前例的英雄事迹，他们捍卫社会主义的历史性的成果，保卫祖国的自由、荣誉和独立。
    苏联在伟大卫国战争中取得的胜利，具有重大的国际意义。第二次世界大战中法西斯主义力量的被摧毁和人民解放斗争的胜利，使得国际范围内社会主义力量和资本主义力量的对比发生了变化。欧亚许多国家脱离了资本主义体系，这些国家的劳动人民在他们的马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，建立了人民民主制度，开始走上建设社会主义的道路。世界社会主义体系的建立是我们时代的主要特征。现在，团结在强大的社会主义阵营里的苏联、中华人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国，在争取共产主义胜利，争取和平、民主和社会进步的斗争中，组成了一支伟大的无敌的力量。
    书中全面地阐述了共产党一贯执行的苏联和平外交政策。这个政策的基础是列宁提出的两种不同社会制度和平共处的原则，以及发展和巩固同强大社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊和兄弟合作。
      教科书最后三章叙述了战后时期苏联共产党的历史
    教科书的结尾三章叙述战后时期共产党的历史。书中着重指出，最后一个五年计划年代，在苏联生活方面、在党的活动方面、在党为在苏联建立起共产主义社会、为维护和巩固和平而进行的斗争方面发生了许多重大的事件。书中指出，从政治和经济措施的意义来说，从党的创造性活动的规模和群众的社会积极性的水平来说，这个时期是苏共历史上最重要的时期之一。
    就在这些年代里，苏维埃国家在党的领导下，在对外政策方面展开了强有力的、目标明确的斗争，以缓和国际紧张局势，防止新的世界大战，进一步巩固苏联的国际地位，巩固整个社会主义阵营。在这些年代里，我们党大力加强了国际共产主义运动的团结；根据马克思列宁主义的原则，巩固了同其他国家兄弟共产党和工人党的同志联系和合作，加强了社会主义国家的友好团结。
    在这一时期，苏联人民在共产党领导下，在国内实行了巨大的政治和经济措施，来进一步巩固苏联社会制度和国家制度，大力发展工业，首先是发展重工业，急剧发展农业，发展科学和文化，增进人民的物质福利。党根据列宁主义原则和党的生活准则改造了自己的全部工作，把这些原则和准则创造性地运用于新的条件，根据积累起来的极其丰富的经验，铲除一切阻碍苏联社会前进的、与列宁主义精神不相容的东西。党和人民的不共戴天的敌人，政治冒险家贝利亚的揭露，对于巩固苏维埃制度具有重大的意义。党坚决地反对个人迷信，并在苏维埃社会生活各方面铲除了个人迷信的后果。这些年代的特点是群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性空前高涨，全苏联人民更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围。
    党的第二十次代表大会是苏联和共产党生活中、国际共产主义运动中极重大的事件。这次代表大会决定了苏联共产主义建设的具体任务，指出了发展和巩固苏维埃制度的道路，按照新的方式提出和解决了现代国际情况发展中的许多根本的原则性问题。第二十次代表大会的决议对于党的全部生活、对于苏埃维社会沿着共产主义道路的发展产生了巨大的影响。书中指出，苏联人民在执行党的第二十次代表大会决议后，在社会生活各方面获得了巨大的成就。根据第二十次代表大会的决议，党和它的列宁式的中央委员会接受尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的建议，制定和实行了许多重大的真正革命的措施，如改组工业和建筑业管理形式、改组机器拖拉机站和进一步巩固集体农庄制度、改进国民教育制度。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会以后这段时期内，粉碎马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团，具有重大的原则性意义。这个集团运用最卑劣的派别斗争的手法，企图破坏党的团结，使党和国家离开列宁主义的道路。这个集团反对党为实现第二十次代表大会决议所采取的一切最重要的措施；反对那些使我们在发展工农业、增进人民福利方面能够取得巨大成就的措施，以及在对外政策方面能够缓和国际紧张局势与巩固和平事业的措施。
    反党集团的派别活动被及时地揭露了；这一小撮分裂分子在思想上和政治上被粉碎了，并且被苏联人民从自己的道路上抛弃了。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志，中央委员会主席团委员和候补委员、中央委员会书记阿·波·阿里斯托夫、尼·伊·别利亚耶夫、列·伊·勃列日?夫、阿·伊·基里钦科、弗·罗·科兹洛夫、阿·伊·米高扬、努·阿·穆希金诺夫、彼·尼·波斯别洛夫、米·安·苏斯洛夫、叶·阿·福尔采娃、尼·米·什维尔尼克，以及中央委员会委员尼·格·伊格纳托夫、奥·威·库西宁、捷·谢·科罗特钦科、杨·艾·卡恩别尔津、安·巴·基里连柯、阿·尼·柯西金、基·特·马祖罗夫、瓦·巴·姆然瓦那则、尼·维·波德戈尔内、捷·谢·波利扬斯基等等同志捍卫党的总路线，捍卫苏共第二十次代表大会所规定的方针，坚决反对反党集团，对这个集团攻击党的列宁主义路线的活动给以致命的回击。1957年6月举行的苏共中央全会认为，反党集团的活动是和共产党的列宁主义原则不相容的。党和苏联全体人民一致赞同中央全会的决议。
    教科书用很大的篇幅总结了共产党在苏维埃政权四十年内的活动。我国各族人民和全体进步人类隆重地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年，这是全世界社会主义力量的示威，是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想的真正的凯旋。纪念十月革命四十周年的时候在莫斯科召开的兄弟共产党和工人党代表会议，在它纲领性的文献里宣称：我们时代的主要内容是由俄国伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡。
    书中有一章专门叙述苏联进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，叙述制定共产主义建设的宏伟纲领和决定党在现阶段的主要任务的历史性的苏共第二十一次代表大会。党的第二十一次代表大会在一致通过的决议中，同意尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的提纲和报告，批准了1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字。苏联发展国民经济的七年计划是党所制定的建设共产主义社会纲领的最重要部分，是建立共产主义物质技术基础的决定性阶段。
    我国各族人民把代表大会决议和七年计划看成是自己的切身事业。苏共中央六月全会制定了执行党的第二十一次代表大会决议的措施，制定了国民经济各部门实现技术进步的纲领。在六月全会后蓬勃展开的争取提前完成七年计划的全民社会主义竞赛，说明了苏联人民有决心实现党的历史性的决议。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的报告和苏共第二十一次代表大会决议里所提出的深刻的理论原理，是对进一步发展马克思列宁主义、发展国际共产主义运动的重大贡献。这些理论原理是：关于苏联社会主义的完全和彻底的胜利问题，关于共产主义社会的两个阶段和社会主义成长为共产主义的规律性问题，关于共产主义社会的物质技术基础问题，关于社会主义条件下和共产主义条件下物质财富的分配问题，关于社会主义所有制的集体农庄形式和全民形式的发展和接近的道路问题，关于全面展开共产主义建设时期的社会政治组织问题，关于世界社会主义体系的发展问题等等。苏共第二十一次代表大会着重指出目前时期思想工作的重要性，指出对劳动者进行共产主义教育和克服人们意识中的资本主义残余应当成为党、苏维埃机关、工会、共青团和其他社会团体注意的中心和工作的重点。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会光辉地表现出国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的团结。代表大会更加充分地显示出党在苏联国内和国外的威信日益增高。争取社会主义和共产主义胜利的斗争的全部经验，证明了列宁主义的一个最重要的结论的正确性，这就是：在建设共产主义社会的过程中党的作用会愈来愈提高。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在说明共产党的伟大作用和党在争取共产主义斗争中的历史性的胜利时说：“共产党显示出它有无愧于它的伟大组织者和创造者天才的列宁的意志和本领”。
      苏共党史说明共产主义思想具有无
    敌的力量；党是和平、民主和社会主
    义斗争的前卫
      “苏联共产党历史”这本教科书是对阐明马克思列宁主义思想的著作的一个重大贡献，它能帮助我们研究我们党的英勇斗争的道路，帮助我们用马克思列宁主义理论来武装干部、共产党员和广大群众。
    编写一部关于苏共历史的科学著作是一件重大的事情，全党都密切关心着这件事情。今后还应当继续不断地改进这本教科书：在本书再版的时候，可以删去一些次要的细节，个别地方的叙述还可以更确切和更扼要一些，各章的文体要力求一致。在苏联和其他社会主义国家的共产主义建设过程中，苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会的历史性决议的意义，将会愈来愈充分地显示出来。因此，我们认为，将叙述苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会的各章继续加以修改，使近年来我们党在丰富共产主义建设的理论和实践方面，在丰富马克思列宁主义宝库方面所作的伟大贡献得到更充分的阐述，这是极端重要的。
    苏联共产党的历史说明共产主义思想具有无敌的力量。我们党和其他兄弟党紧密地团结在一起，站在为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的前列。
    共产党的历史教导我们：工人阶级只有在革命的马克思列宁主义政党领导下才能取得胜利；从资本主义过渡到共产主义和成功地解决共产主义建设的任务，只有在无产阶级专政的基础上才有可能；要顺利地建设社会主义和共产主义，党的全部活动就应当以马克思列宁主义理论为指导，应当忠于马克思列宁主义，创造性地运用理论，彻底实行理论和实践的统一，对敌视共产主义的资产阶级思想进行不调和的斗争；坚持作为社会主义革命胜利的必要条件的工人阶级的团结；对机会主义者、修正主义者、妥协分子和缺乏信心分子进行不调和的斗争；巩固以马克思列宁主义思想原则为基础的党的统一；遵守铁的纪律，实行列宁主义的民主集中制原则和集体领导原则；不断巩固党同人民群众的联系，大胆地揭露缺点、弱点和错误，开展原则性的批评和自我批评。党保卫着建设共产主义的人民的根本利益，它是真正的爱国主义力量；党在理论和实际活动中永远遵循无产阶级国际主义的原则。苏联和其他社会主义国家胜利地建设社会主义的丰富经验，令人信服地说明马克思列宁主义所指示的道路是达到伟大目标——共产主义的唯一正确的道路。
    研究苏共历史，研究党所走过的胜利道路，研究马克思列宁主义理论，可以用社会发展规律的知识、建设共产主义社会的知识来武装劳动人民。研究党的历史会使共产党人和苏联全体人民，因自己的党和祖国的全世界历史意义的胜利而产生自豪感，会使他们愿意把自己的全部力量贡献给伟大的共产主义建设事业。列宁谈到共产党时说过，党体现着“我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心”；研究这个党的最丰富的经验，有助于成功地解决全面展开的共产主义社会建设的任务。
