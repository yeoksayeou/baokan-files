Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Tokyo—Under the pressure of the Japanese people's resolute struggle and domestic and international public opinion, the Japanese Supreme Court on the 10th made a judgment on the "Matsukawa Incident" to "revoke the second instance judgment and send it back to the Sendai High Court for retrial."

The Supreme Court acknowledged that the evidence on which the Sendai High Court based its second instance judgment on the "Matsukawa Incident" was not credible, and therefore "the judgment on the entire Matsukawa Incident is also not credible."

On the 10th, from early morning, thousands of workers, students, and citizens gathered around the Supreme Court building, awaiting this important verdict. The Japanese authorities dispatched three thousand armed police to "guard" the Supreme Court.

When the news of the verdict came out, thousands of people applauded and cheered. The masses unanimously believed that this was the first step towards winning a complete victory in the struggle, and expressed their determination to fight to the end for the final victory.

The "Matsukawa Incident" defendant group immediately issued a statement after the verdict, expressing heartfelt thanks to the Japanese people who have consistently stood with the defendants in launching a heroic struggle for more than a decade. They firmly stated in the statement that in the future, they will not only strive for a verdict acquitting all defendants but also thoroughly pursue the real criminals who fabricated this incident.

The "Matsukawa Incident" defense lawyers group also issued a statement pointing out that this verdict is an achievement of the struggle of the people at home and abroad to uphold peace and truth. The statement condemned the Supreme Court for not making a verdict acquitting all defendants.

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 10th regarding the Supreme Court's verdict on the "Matsukawa Incident," pointing out that because of this verdict, the death sentences of the first and second instances have been abandoned. Their previous "basis" for the judgment has completely collapsed, which is equivalent to the court admitting that all defendants are innocent.

The statement pointed out that although this is the case, the defendants have not been acquitted, which is unjust and violates the expectations of the Japanese people.

The statement said that the court, as one of the class ruling organs, made such a judgment today because it is a victory of truth and justice, a victory of the united struggle of the Japanese people, and at the same time, an achievement made possible by the unified support of the people all over the world.

The statement emphasized that the struggle of the "Matsukawa Incident" has since entered a new stage with hope of victory. Through the struggle of the "Matsukawa Incident," we have personally experienced that as long as we unite with millions and tens of millions of people, we can achieve great victories. In the future, the struggle of the "Matsukawa Incident" must be regarded as an important link in the people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty," and we must strive for the victory of the people in the struggle against reactionary politics.

More than two thousand workers, students, and citizens immediately held a rally in Hibiya Park after the Supreme Court's verdict. After the rally, all the participants broke through the police blockade and took to the streets, holding a demonstration. They shouted slogans along the way demanding the acquittal of the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 10th regarding the Japanese Supreme Court's verdict on the "Matsukawa Incident," pointing out that making this verdict is a victory for the Japanese people who have struggled for the truth of the incident for the past long ten years.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan issued a statement on the 10th stating that the General Council will, together with all the people of Japan, fight to the end to win the acquittal of all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." (Attached picture)

    日本最高裁判所被迫宣判撤销“松川事件”二审判决
    日本各界决心争取无罪释放全体被告
　　全体被告表示要追究制造冤狱的真正凶手
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯，东京消息：在日本人民坚决斗争和国内外舆论的压力下，日本最高裁判所10日对“松川事件”作出了“撤销第二审判决，发回仙台高等裁判所重新审理”的判决。
    最高裁判所承认，仙台高等裁判所就“松川事件”作出的第二审判决所依据的证据是不能令人置信的，因而“对整个松川事件的判断也就不能令人置信”。
    10日，从早晨就有成千的工人、学生和市民云集在最高裁判所大厦周围，等候着这一重要的判决。日本当局派出三千名武装警察在最高裁判所前进行“戒备”。
    判决的消息传出以后，数千名群众鼓掌欢呼。群众们一致认为这是争取斗争完全胜利的第一步，并且表示要为争取最后胜利而斗争到底。
    “松川事件”被告团在宣判以后立即发表声明，对十几年来一贯同被告在一起展开英勇斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的感谢。他们在声明中坚决表示，今后不仅要争取判决全体被告无罪，还要彻底追究捏造这个事件的真正凶犯。
      “松川事件”辩护律师团也发表声明指出，这次判决是国内外人民群众为维护和平与真理的斗争所取得的成就。声明谴责最高裁判所没有作出全体被告无罪的判决。
    日本共产党中央委员会10日就最高裁判所关于
  “松川事件”的判决发表声明指出，由于这次判决，第一审和第二审的死刑判决已经被废弃。它们以前作为判决的“根据”都完全破产了，等于裁判所承认全体被告无罪。
    声明指出，虽然是这样，但是被告们没有被宣判无罪，这是不正当的，是违背日本人民的期望的。
    声明说，作为阶级统治机构之一的裁判所今天所以作出了这样的判决，这是真理和正义的胜利，是日本人民团结斗争的胜利，同时是由于全世界人民团结一致给予的支援而取得的成就。
    声明强调指出，“松川事件”的斗争从此进入有胜利希望的新阶段，通过“松川事件”斗争我们亲身体验到，只要我们同几百万、几千万人民团结起来，我们就能够取得巨大的胜利。今后，必须把“松川事件”的斗争当做人民反对修改“安全条约”斗争的一个重要环节，并且为使人民在同反动政治的斗争中取得胜利而奋斗。
    两千多名工人、学生和市民在最高裁判所宣判后立即在日比谷公园举行了集会。集会结束后，全体与会者冲破警察的阻挡走向街头，举行了示威游行。他们在沿途高喊着要求判决“松川事件”被告无罪的口号。
    日本社会党10日就日本最高裁判所关于“松川事件”的判决发表声明指出，作出这个判决，是在漫长的十年间为找出事件的真相而斗争到今天的日本人民的胜利。
    日本工会总评议会10日发表声明表示，总评议会将同日本全体人民一起，为争取无罪释放“松川事件”全体被告而斗争到底。（附图片）
