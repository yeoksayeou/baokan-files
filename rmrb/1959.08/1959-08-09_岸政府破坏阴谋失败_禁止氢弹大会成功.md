    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Hiroshima Dispatch: Yasui Kaoru, Chairman of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and Director-General of the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said today that peace-loving people have a responsibility to faithfully implement the resolutions and appeals passed at the conference, to carry out the movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, and to make it a movement of all the people of Japan and the people of all countries in the world.

    Yasui Kaoru made these remarks at a press conference held in Hiroshima when making an overall assessment of the achievements of the conference.

    Yasui Kaoru said: Although fascists sabotaged the World Conference, the conference achieved victory due to the support of people from a wide range of strata. He went on to say that the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs must resist unreasonable political pressure.

    Yasui Kaoru said: The discussions by Japanese and foreign representatives participating in the conference were very enthusiastic, and unanimous opinions were reached in accordance with democratic principles.

    Xinhua News Agency, August 7th, Hiroshima Dispatch: The plot of the Nobusuke Kishi government to instruct fascists to sabotage the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has been thoroughly defeated.

    The Kishi Nobusuke government had instructed various prefectures in Japan not to send representatives to the World Conference and adopted a non-cooperative attitude towards the conference. It also attempted to obstruct the conference from discussing the issue of opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The armed police of the Kishi Nobusuke government also beat students who questioned the Hiroshima Prefectural Government's lack of support for the World Conference.

    In Hiroshima City, Japanese fascists also distributed leaflets everywhere, slandering the World Conference as being "manipulated by communists and a hypocritical peace movement." They also injured several representatives attending the conference in an attempt to obstruct the conference from proceeding.

    However, very few people picked up the leaflets distributed by the fascists. Foreign representatives attending the conference unanimously pointed out that the fascists' attempt to disrupt the meeting had completely failed. John Roberts, a representative from the United States, said that he felt very relieved to see that the majority of the Japanese people were united around the World Conference.

    The representatives attending the World Conference also unanimously pointed out that these actions by Japanese right-wing elements only proved that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were very afraid of the peace movement.

    However, the Kishi Nobusuke clique, eager to revise the "Security Treaty" and implement nuclear armament, is unwilling to accept its failure and intends to obstruct the next World Conference. Masajiro Kawashima, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, said at a press conference today that the Japanese anti-nuclear weapons movement has interfered too much in political issues. He even threatened that if the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs does not change its nature, it may not be allowed to initiate the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs next year.

    岸政府破坏阴谋失败
    禁止氢弹大会成功
    新华社8日讯　广岛消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长兼第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会总负责人安井郁今天说，爱好和平的人民有责任忠实地执行大会上通过的决议和呼吁书，进行反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，并且把它作为日本全体人民和全世界各国人民的运动。
    安井郁是在广岛举行的记者招待会上对大会的成就作总的评价时说这番话的。
    安井郁说：尽管法西斯分子破坏世界大会，但是由于广泛阶层的人民支持大会，使大会取得了胜利。他接着说，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会要抵抗无理的政治压力。
    安井郁说：参加大会的日本和外国代表进行的讨论是很热烈的，而且按照民主原则达成了全体一致的意见。
    新华社7日讯　广岛消息：岸信介政府指示法西斯分子破坏第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的阴谋遭到了彻底的失败。
    岸信介政府曾经指令日本各县不要派代表参加世界大会，对大会采取不协助态度。它并且企图阻挠大会讨论反对修改日美
  “安全条约”问题。岸信介政府的武装警察还殴打了质问广岛县政府不支持世界大会的学生。
    日本法西斯分子在广岛市还到处散发传单，诬蔑世界大会“受到共产主义者的操纵，是虚伪的和平运动。”他们并且打伤了几位参加大会的代表，企图阻挠大会的进行。
    但是，极少人去拣法西斯分子所散发的传单。参加大会的外国代表们一致指出，法西斯分子扰乱会议的企图已经完全失败。美国代表约翰·罗伯茨说，他看到日本大多数人民团结在世界大会周围的情况，感到非常放心。
    出席世界大会的代表们还一致指出，日本右翼分子的这些行动只是证明，岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党非常害怕和平运动。
    但是，一心急于修改“安全条约”、实行核武装的岸信介集团不甘心它的失败，又打算阻挠下一次世界大会。自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎今天在记者招待会上说什么日本的反对核武器运动过多地干预了政治问题。他竟然威胁说，如果日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会不改变它的性质，明年可能不准许协议会发起举行第六届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。
