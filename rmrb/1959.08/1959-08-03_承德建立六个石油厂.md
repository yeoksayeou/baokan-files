Xinhua News Agency report:

    Chengde Special District, Hebei Province, has established six small oil refineries using local oil shale and coal as raw materials, with an annual output of several thousand tons of oil. In the first half of this year, these plants have already refined more than 400 tons of crude oil.
    Chengde Special District established some indigenous oil refineries last year. In the first half of this year, they adjusted the production scale of each plant, added machinery such as diesel engines, electric motors, exhaust fans, and water pumps, and established six relatively modernized small oil refineries. In the process of consolidating and improving indigenous oil refineries, they also improved labor organization and production management, which generally increased labor productivity in each plant by about 40% and significantly reduced costs.
