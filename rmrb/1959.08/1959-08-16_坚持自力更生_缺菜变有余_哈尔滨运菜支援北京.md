Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 15th. Harbin, a city that has historically relied on external sources for vegetable supplies, is experiencing a bumper harvest of summer vegetables this year. It is now supporting cities such as Beijing and Dalian with a large quantity of seasonal fresh vegetables. The first batch of vegetables to be transported south is planned to be 20 million jin, of which 15 million jin will be used to support Beijing. Shipments began on the 13th and are scheduled to be completed by the end of the month. The railway department is actively deploying refrigerated cars for transportation.

This year, Harbin has sown more than 169,000 mu of summer vegetables, an increase of 30% compared to last year. Total production is expected to increase by 54% compared to last year. Since the beginning of August, an average of 3.3 million jin of vegetables have been put on the market every day, with a peak of 4 million jin in one day. The varieties of vegetables include more than 30 kinds such as cucumbers, eggplants, cowpeas, zucchini, tomatoes, and celery. Now, fresh vegetables can be bought on every street in Harbin from morning to night.

The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the spirit of "self-reliance as the mainstay, striving for external assistance as a supplement," began to arrange for the production of summer vegetables this spring. The people's communes in the suburbs and counties under the city fully utilized manpower and material resources to ensure that summer vegetables were sown in staggered batches as much as possible. Cucumbers, zucchini, cowpeas, etc., are generally sown in three batches, one after another, to extend the supply time of various summer vegetables. Cucumbers began to appear on the market in early June this year. If there are no major disasters in the future, locally produced fresh cucumbers can be supplied until early September, extending the supply period by about a month compared to previous years. All organs, factories, and enterprises that have the conditions have opened small farms, and these farms can now pick 300,000 jin of vegetables every day. Residential areas with conditions for developing vegetable production have also mobilized residents to grow vegetables. Residents in the three districts of Taiping, Guxiang, and Nangang have planted nearly 6,000 mu of vegetables. Among them, 60% of the residents in Taiping District can now avoid going to the market to buy vegetables.

The Harbin Municipal People's Committee recently called on the people of the city to dry and pickle vegetables on a large scale. By the beginning of August, the commercial departments alone had pickled more than 3 million jin of vegetables. The city's 480,000 mu of autumn vegetables have been planted according to plan; the earlier planted seedlings have emerged from the soil and are growing vigorously.

    坚持自力更生  缺菜变有余
    哈尔滨运菜支援北京
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　历年需要外地供应蔬菜的哈尔滨市，今年夏季蔬菜大丰收，目前正以大量时令鲜菜支援北京、旅大等城市。计划第一批南运的蔬菜有二千万斤，其中以一千五百万斤支援北京。13日已开始启运，预定月底运完。铁道部门正抽调冷藏车积极调运。
    哈尔滨市今年播种夏季蔬菜十六万九千多亩，比去年增加30％，总产量预计比去年增加54％。从8月上旬以来，平均每天有三百三十万斤蔬菜上市，最高时一天上市四百万斤。蔬菜的品种，有黄瓜、茄子、豆角、西葫芦、西红柿、芹菜等三十多种。现在，哈尔滨的每条街上，从早到晚都可以买到新鲜蔬菜。
    中共哈尔滨市委本着“自力更生为主、力争外援为辅”的精神，在今年春季就开始布置夏季蔬菜的生产。市郊和市属各县的人民公社充分利用人力、物力，对夏菜尽量做到排开播种。黄瓜、西葫芦、豆角等一般都分三批下种，一茬接一茬，以延长各种夏菜的供应时间。今年6月上旬黄瓜就开始上市，今后如无特大灾害，本地生产的鲜黄瓜可以一直供应到9月上旬，比往年延长约一个月。各机关、工厂、企业，有条件的都开办了小型农场，这些农场现在每天可以采摘三十万斤蔬菜。有条件发展蔬菜生产的居民区，也发动居民种植蔬菜。太平、顾乡、南岗三个区的居民，共种了蔬菜将近六千亩。其中，太平区有60％的居民现在可以不用上市场买菜。
    哈尔滨市人民委员会最近又号召全市人民大量晒菜、腌菜。仅商业部门到8月上旬就腌了三百多万斤菜。全市四十八万亩秋菜已经按计划种完；种得较早的菜苗已经出土，长得又旺又壮。
