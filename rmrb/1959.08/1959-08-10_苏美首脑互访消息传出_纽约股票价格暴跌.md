Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, TASS, New York, August 8th: New York stock market prices plummeted, with stock prices falling an average of ten points over the past four days. The most significant declines were in the stocks of industrial companies producing for military orders. Wall Street believes this is a result of the announcement of mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States.
    The "New York Herald Tribune" said that Wall Street believes that the reciprocal visits of Khrushchev and Eisenhower may ease the tensions of the Cold War, which would lead to a reduction in military appropriations.

    苏美首脑互访消息传出
    纽约股票价格暴跌
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社纽约8日讯：纽约股票行市暴跌，股票牌价在过去四天平均下跌了十点。下跌得最厉害的是一些为军事订货而生产的工业公司的股票。华尔街认为，这是苏美两国领导人宣布互相访问的结果。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”说，华尔街认为赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问可能缓和冷战的紧张局势，这样就会导致军事拨款的减少。
