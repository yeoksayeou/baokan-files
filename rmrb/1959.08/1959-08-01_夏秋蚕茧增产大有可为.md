Increased Production of Summer and Autumn Silkworm Cocoons Holds Great Promise

This year, China's spring silkworm cocoon production achieved a bumper harvest, with silkworm cocoon output increasing by nearly 10% compared to the same period last year. Currently, various regions are carrying out the purchase of summer silkworm cocoons and preparing for autumn silkworm rearing. According to preliminary arrangements in various regions, the planned target for summer and autumn silkworm cocoon production is approximately equal to that of the spring season, an increase of about 80% compared to the actual output of the same period last year. In previous years, the output of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons in China has been around 30% of the spring cocoon output, but in the context of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it increased to 60%. This year's plan to develop summer and autumn silkworm cocoon production is the largest since the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Based on this plan, various regions have prepared sufficient silkworm eggs, and the growth of mulberry trees is also better than in previous years. With effort, it is possible to complete this plan.

To strive for a bumper harvest of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons, the first thing to do is to focus on mulberry field management centered on fertilization and pest control, and vigorously increase mulberry leaf production. Mulberry leaves are the material basis for developing sericulture. Only by increasing mulberry leaf production can we raise more silkworms, raise them well, harvest more cocoons, and harvest good cocoons. Various regions should manage the mulberry seedlings that have been sown, carry out timely thinning, pest control, and topdressing, to meet the requirements of cultivating good seedlings and strong seedlings; at the same time, they must manage the newly planted mulberry trees from last year and this year, as well as the original old mulberry gardens.

Secondly, seize the opportunity to implement production targets to contracting units as soon as possible, arrange the labor force needed for mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing, and conscientiously implement the system of contracting work and output, and rewarding overproduction, and implement the principle of distribution according to work, more work more gain. Experience has proven that places where contracting work and output and distribution according to work are well implemented have seen a significant increase in output. Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, fully implemented the "three guarantees and one reward, overproduction reward" method this spring, and the county's average yield reached 64 jin, and the total output increased by 45.5% compared with the same period last year. Autumn silkworm rearing should also implement contracting work and output as soon as possible, so as to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses more fully. Zhejiang Province's method of contracting work and output is to contract the total output of silkworm cocoons based on the area of ​​mulberry gardens, and take a one-time contract for three to five years based on the perennial characteristics of mulberry trees. The masses are very satisfied with this method, and the management of mulberry gardens has achieved good results.

Vigorously preventing and controlling diseases and pests is also an important factor in ensuring a greater bumper harvest of summer and autumn silkworm cocoons. Last year's summer and autumn silkworm cocoon production increased by 60% compared with the spring season, which was an unprecedented bumper harvest in the ten years since the founding of the country. The main reason for achieving the bumper harvest was the strengthening of disease prevention and control work. Although silkworm diseases also occurred widely in the later stage of spring silkworms this year, the impact on output was not significant because various regions grasped it tightly and treated it early. Therefore, thoroughly preventing and controlling silkworm diseases is an important key to ensuring a bumper harvest of autumn silkworm cocoons. The eradication of silkworm diseases should be based on prevention, combined with treatment. This requires thorough disinfection of silkworm rearing tools and silkworm rearing rooms, and improving environmental hygiene, so that silkworms can eat well and live well. This is the primary measure to prevent the spread of bacteria. Some areas have carried out the movement of "raising silkworms once, disinfecting once" and "disease-free communes, disease-free teams, disease-free communal rearing rooms," which is very helpful for preventing silkworm diseases. If silkworm diseases occur during the feeding period, efforts should be actively organized to rescue them. For some major silkworm diseases such as grasserie, muscardine, and flacherie, there are already effective agents such as anti-grasserie powder, Xilisheng, penicillin, and garlic juice, which can be widely used in various regions. As long as mass disease and pest control work is carried out, the harm of silkworm diseases can be avoided and reduced.

### 夏秋蚕茧增产大有可为

    夏秋蚕茧增产大有可为
    今年我国的春季蚕茧生产获得了丰收，桑蚕茧产量比去年同期增产近一成。目前各地正在进行夏蚕茧的收购和秋蚕饲养的准备工作。根据各地的初步安排，夏秋蚕茧产量计划指标约同春季相等，比去年同期的实际产量增加80％左右。我国夏秋蚕茧的产量历年为春茧的30％上下，在1958年大跃进的形势下增到60％。今年发展夏秋蚕茧生产的计划，是建国以来最大的一次。各地根据这个计划，已经准备了足够的蚕种，桑树的生长情况也比往年好，经过努力，完成这个计划是有可能的。
    争取夏秋季蚕茧丰收，首先应该抓住以施肥除虫为中心的桑田管理工作，大力增产桑叶。桑叶是发展养蚕业的物质基础，只有在提高桑叶产量的基础上，才能多养蚕，养好蚕，多收茧，收好茧。各地应该把已经播下的桑苗管理好，及时间苗、除虫、追肥，达到育好苗，育壮苗的要求；同时要管理好去年和今年新栽桑树及原有的老桑园。
    其次要抓紧时机，及早把生产指标落实到包产单位，安排好培桑养蚕所需要的劳动力，并认真推行包工包产、超产奖励制度，贯彻按劳分配多劳多得的原则。经验证明，凡是包工包产、按劳分配执行得好的地方，产量都显著提高。江苏省无锡县由于今春全面执行“三包一奖、超产奖励”的办法，全县平均单产达到六十四斤，总产量比去年同期提高了45.5％。秋季养蚕也应及早把包工包产贯彻下去，以便把群众的积极性更充分地调动起来。浙江省包工包产的办法是以桑园面积包蚕茧总产量，并根据桑树多年生的特性采取一次包三年至五年。群众很满意这种办法，对桑园的管理收到了良好效果。
    大力防治病虫灾害，也是保证夏秋蚕茧更大丰收的一个重要因素。去年夏秋蚕茧比春季增产60％，是建国十年来空前的大丰收，取得丰收的主要原因是，加强病害防治工作。今年春蚕后期虽然也普遍发生了蚕病，但由于各地抓的紧、治的早，对产量影响不大。因此，彻底防治蚕病是保证秋蚕茧丰收的重要关键。扑灭蚕病，应当以预防为主，防治结合。这就必须彻底做好蚕具蚕室的消毒，搞好环境卫生，使蚕儿吃得饱，住得好，这是杜绝病菌传染的首要措施。有些地区开展了“养一次蚕，消一次毒”和“无病社、无病队、无病共育室”运动，对预防蚕病很有作用。饲养期间发生了蚕病，应积极组织力量抢救。对于某些主要的蚕病如僵病、脓病、软病等，已经有行之有效的防僵粉、西力生及青霉素、大蒜汁等药剂，各地可以广泛应用。只要开展群众性的防治病虫害工作，是可以避免和减轻蚕病为害的。
