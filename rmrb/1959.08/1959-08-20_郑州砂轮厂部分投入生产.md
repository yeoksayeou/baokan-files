Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 19th: A large, modern, comprehensive abrasive tool manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou—the Zhengzhou Abrasive Wheel Factory—has erected a tall factory building. The machine installation project is being accelerated, and some parts have been put into production.

　　The Zhengzhou Abrasive Wheel Factory is being built with the help of the German Democratic Republic. The whole factory is divided into four systems: alumina, silicon carbide, abrasive wheel manufacturing, and auxiliary systems. At present, the civil engineering work of the four workshops of the abrasive wheel manufacturing system has been basically completed, with 80% of the equipment installed. In the alumina system, except for the screening workshop which is still under construction, the civil engineering work of the bauxite warehouse and smelting and crushing primary selection workshops has also been basically completed, and more than half of the machines have been installed. The silicon carbide system, which started later, has completed the silicon carbide warehouse, and the smelting and processing workshops are under intensive construction.

　　Due to the policy of building and producing at the same time, some temporary factory buildings were built before the factory buildings were all completed, and some equipment of the abrasive wheel manufacturing system was put into production. From November last year to now, more than 1,200 tons of emery and more than 330 tons of abrasive wheels have been produced.

　  郑州砂轮厂部分投入生产
    据新华社郑州19日电　建设在郑州的一座大型现代化综合研磨工具制造厂——郑州砂轮厂，已盖起了一座高大的厂房，机器安装工程正在加紧进行，并且部分投入了生产。
    郑州砂轮厂是德意志民主共和国帮助建设的。全厂共分为氧化铝、碳化矽、砂轮制造和辅助等四个系统。目前，砂轮制造系统四个车间的土建工程已基本上完工，有80％的设备安装完毕；氧化铝系统除筛选车间正在施工以外，铝矾土仓库和冶炼、破碎初选等车间的土建工程也基本建成，机器安装好一半以上，动工较晚的碳化矽系统，碳化矽仓库已经建成，冶炼和加工车间正在加紧施工。
    由于采取边建设边生产的方针，在厂房还未全部建成以前，建起了一些临时厂房，并将砂轮制造系统的部分设备投入了生产。从去年11月到目前为止，已生产出金刚砂一千二百多吨，砂轮三百三十多吨。
