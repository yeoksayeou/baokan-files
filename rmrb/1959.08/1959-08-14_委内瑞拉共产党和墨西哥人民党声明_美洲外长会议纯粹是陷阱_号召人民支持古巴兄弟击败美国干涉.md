Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, August 12th: The Communist Party of Venezuela issued a statement today regarding the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference being held in Chile, calling on the entire nation to fully support Cuba and crush the interventionist schemes of US imperialism.

The statement pointed out that this conference will take place under the following circumstances: on the one hand, US imperialism and its running dogs are exerting pressure in order to intervene in Cuba and Venezuela, and to suppress the democratic liberation movements in Latin America; on the other hand, the movement of solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela and condemnation of US colonialist policies is growing stronger in various countries.

The statement emphasized that the cause of defending Cuba and Venezuela has won strong sympathy in Latin America; the democratic and patriotic consciousness of the people of Latin American countries has been greatly enhanced and encouraged by the failures of US imperialism on the international stage. "The people of Latin America are increasingly convinced that US imperialism is not an invincible giant. US imperialism can be defeated, and its war policies and policies of enslaving weak countries are being defeated."

The statement then pointed out, "The principle of non-interference and the principle of popular sovereignty are just principles that are welcomed and supported by progressive movements in various countries. However, it must be pointed out that for many years, the US imperialists have shamelessly violated this principle in our countries, plundering our wealth and imposing brutal traitorous regimes on us. Now they are waving the banner of non-interference to protect Trujillo and Somoza, but at the same time, they are preparing to attack the Cuban revolution and create a Batista-style Armas."

The statement said, "The Venezuelan government has taken a just position on the problems in the Caribbean region. The people of our countries will not allow any other attitude. Our people unanimously support the Cuban revolution and oppose Trujillo and Somoza."

The statement finally called on the people of the whole country to defend Venezuela's position at the Foreign Ministers' Conference: wholeheartedly support the fraternal Republic of Cuba, strive for the realization of human rights, strive to crush the interventionist schemes of US imperialism, and oppose the existence of terrorist dictatorships.

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, August 13th: TASS reports from Mexico City on August 13th: The Mexican People's Party issued a statement pointing out that the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference, convened under the instigation of the United States, is purely a trap set for Latin American countries. The statement accused the "Organization of American States" of being a docile tool of the United States. The People's Party demanded that the Mexican delegation attending the Inter-American Foreign Ministers' Conference resolutely uphold the principles of non-interference and self-determination.

　　委内瑞拉共产党和墨西哥人民党声明
　　美洲外长会议纯粹是陷阱
　　号召人民支持古巴兄弟击败美国干涉
    据新华社加拉加斯12日电　委内瑞拉共产党今天就在智利举行的美洲外长会议发表声明，号召全国人民全力支持古巴和粉碎美帝国主义的干涉阴谋。
    声明指出，这次会议将在如下的情况下进行：一方面是美帝国主义及其走卒施加压力，以便达到干涉古巴、委内瑞拉以及镇压拉丁美洲民主解放运动的目的；另一方面是各国人民声援古巴和委内瑞拉、谴责美国殖民主义政策的运动的日益高涨。
    声明强调指出，保卫古巴和委内瑞拉的事业在拉丁美洲赢得了强烈的同情；拉丁美洲国家人民的民主和爱国觉悟大大提高，并且由于美帝国主义在国际范围内所遭到的失败而受到鼓舞。“拉丁美洲人民越来越相信，美帝国主义并不是一个不可战胜的巨人。美帝国主义可以被打败，而且它的战争政策和奴役弱小国家的政策正在遭受失败”。
    声明接着指出，“不干涉原则及人民自觉原则是受到各国进步运动欢迎和支持的正义原则。但是，必须指出，美帝国主义者多年来在我们各国无耻地破坏了这个原则，掠夺我们的财富，强加给我们残暴的卖国政权。现在他们又打着不干涉的旗帜保护特鲁希略和索摩查，但是同时却又准备进攻古巴革命，制造一个巴蒂斯塔式的阿马斯。”
    声明说，“委内瑞拉政府在加勒比地区的问题上采取了正义的立场。我们各国人民不允许采取其他态度。我国人民一致支持古巴革命，反对特鲁希略和索摩查。”
    声明最后号召全国人民保卫委内瑞拉在外长会议上的立场：放手支持古巴兄弟共和国，争取实现人权，争取粉碎美帝国主义的干涉阴谋和反对恐怖的独裁政权的存在。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城13日讯：墨西哥人民党发表声明指出，在美国策动下召开的美洲外长会议纯粹是给拉丁美洲国家设下的陷阱。声明指责“美洲国家组织”是美国的驯服工具。人民党要求出席美洲外长会议的墨西哥代表团坚决维护不干涉和自决的原则。
