Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 1st. Vientiane Radio broadcasted today that the Lao government of Phoui Sananikone has arrested Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee, and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The Phoui Sananikone government, while issuing a communique on the 28th announcing the dispatch of troops to reinforce the Sam Neua region to expand the Lao civil war, also announced the arrest of many leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and threatened to inflict "severe punishments" on them.

The Phoui Sananikone government, under the instigation of the United States, re-launched the civil war in May this year, placing Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front under house arrest. Subsequently, under pressure from public opinion at home and abroad, the Phoui Sananikone government was forced to lift the house arrest order, but continued to place Prince Souphanouvong and others under the close surveillance of special agents and police.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 1st. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today demanding that the Lao Sananikone government cease its hostile actions towards the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and stop the civil war in Laos.

The editorial is entitled: "The Sananikone Government Must Bear Full Responsibility for Their Actions of Expanding the Civil War and Provoking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The editorial condemned the Sananikone government for implementing the US imperialist plot to expand the Lao civil war, intensifying the persecution of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao patriotic people, and provoking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The editorial pointed out that the above-mentioned blatant reactionary actions of the reactionary elements in the Sananikone government, who are acting as American pawns, have created an extremely dangerous situation in Laos, threatening the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia, and threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The editorial revealed that in order to evade their responsibility for the above actions, the Sananikone government issued a statement on July 28, openly slandering that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "commanded" new troops to attack the Lao Kingdom army's stronghold in Sam Neua. At the same time, it fabricated excuses saying that the Lao Patriotic Front leaders under control in Vientiane were "colluding with foreign countries."

The editorial stated that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently been loyal to the policy of peaceful coexistence, loyal to the principles of the Geneva Conference and the Bandung Conference, and hope to establish good-neighborly relations with the Lao people. However, the Sananikone government, following the orders of US imperialism, has adopted a hostile policy towards the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The editorial pointed out that the Sananikone government's slander against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is groundless. This "thief crying stop thief" tactic is to cover up the Lao reactionaries, acting as American pawns, increasing their troops on the Vietnamese-Lao border to realize the US imperialist-directed conspiracy to challenge the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The editorial emphasized that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can never turn a blind eye to the actions of US imperialism and their pawns in Laos that threaten the security and peaceful construction of the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The editorial then pointed out that the Sananikone government's arrest of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front not only seriously violates the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreements signed in Vientiane between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, violates the inviolability of parliamentarians stipulated in the Lao constitution, but also blatantly offends the patriotism of the Lao people and their feelings for their beloved leaders.

The editorial concluded by saying that the extremely dangerous situation in Laos today once again requires the countries responsible for the Geneva Accords, especially the British government, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, not to continue to turn a blind eye to the situation in Laos, but must take urgent measures together with the Soviet government to restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos, in order to prevent the situation in Laos from developing in a direction that is increasingly detrimental to the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    老挝当局悍然逮捕苏发努冯
    越南“人民报”谴责老挝当局的挑衅行为
    新华社河内1日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝培·萨纳尼空政府已经逮捕了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人。
    培·萨纳尼空政府在28日发表公报宣布派军队增援桑怒地区以扩大老挝内战的同时，曾经宣布已经逮捕老挝爱国战线党的许多领导人，并且扬言要对他们“处以重刑”。
  培·萨纳尼空政府今年5月在美国指使下重新发动内战的同时，曾经将苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领导人加以软禁。其后在国内外舆论的压力下，培·萨纳尼空政府被迫取消软禁命令，但是一直仍然把苏发努冯亲王等置于特务和警察的严密监视之下。
    据新华社河内1日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论，要求老挝萨纳尼空政府停止敌视越南民主共和国的行动，恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其它领袖的自由，停止老挝的内战。
    这篇社论的题目是：“萨纳尼空政府必须对他们扩大内战和向越南民主共和国挑衅的行为负起完全责任”。
    这篇社论谴责了萨纳尼空政府执行美帝国主义的阴谋扩大老挝内战的政策，在加紧迫害老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国人民，向越南民主共和国挑衅。社论指出，萨纳尼空政府中充当美国走狗的反动分子的上述明目张胆的反动行为，造成了极其危险的老挝局势，威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平，威胁了越南民主共和国的安全。
    社论揭露，为了逃避他们对上述行为所负的责任，萨纳尼空政府7月28日发表声明，公然诬蔑说，越南民主共和国“指挥”新的部队进攻老挝王国军队在桑怒的据点。同时捏造借口说被管制在万象的老挝爱国战线党领袖“勾结外国”。
    社论说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府始终不渝地忠诚于和平共处政策，忠诚于日内瓦会议和万隆会议的原则，希望同老挝人民建立睦邻关系。可是萨纳尼空政府奉行美帝国主义的命令，对越南人民和越南民主共和国政府采取了敌视政策。
    社论指出，萨纳尼空政府对越南民主共和国的诬蔑是毫无根据的。这种“贼喊捉贼”的手段是为了掩盖充当美国走狗的老挝反动分子在越、老边境增兵，实现美帝国主义指使的向越南民主共和国挑战的阴谋计划。
    社论强调说，越南民主共和国政府绝不能对美帝国主义和它们在老挝的走狗威胁越南民主共和国人民的安全和和平建设事业的行动置若罔闻。
    社论接着指出，萨纳尼空政府逮捕苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领袖不但严重违反1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队在万象签订的协议，违反老挝宪法规定的关于议员的不可侵犯权，而且还明目张胆地触犯了老挝人民的爱国心和他们对自己的亲爱的领袖的感情。
    社论最后说，老挝当前极其危险的局势再一次要求对日内瓦协议负有责任的国家，特别是作为日内瓦会议主席之一的英国政府不能继续对老挝局势视若无睹，而必须同苏联政府一起采取紧急的措施，来恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，以便制止老挝局势朝着越来越有害于印度支那和东南亚和平的方向发展。
