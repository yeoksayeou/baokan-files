Xinhua News Agency, 11th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the 11th entitled "Marching Towards Great Goals With a Mighty Stride," commenting on the achievements of socialist countries in national economic construction during the first half of this year.

The editorial pointed out that the tremendous achievements made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in developing the economy and culture, and in improving the material welfare of the people, convincingly prove the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union is entering the historically significant Seven-Year Plan period with confidence. Inspired by the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party, the Soviet people are using their labor enthusiasm to realize the magnificent program of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. The Soviet Union's industrial production plan for the first half of the year was overfulfilled in terms of both total output value and the production of most important industrial products. The total industrial output value increased by 12% compared to the first half of 1958. The Soviet people received more consumer goods and grain than originally planned. They are doing their best to bring the communist future to an early arrival, and to make the motherland more happy and prosperous.

The editorial said that the people of the fraternal countries are constantly achieving glorious victories on the road of socialist construction. The past six months have marked a rapid development of industrial production in socialist countries. Compared with the same period last year, industrial production in the first six months of this year increased by 9.3% in Poland, 11% in Czechoslovakia, 12.4% in the German Democratic Republic, 26.1% in Albania, 75% in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 62.3% in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 10% in Hungary, and 8.3% in the Mongolian People's Republic. Industry in Romania and Bulgaria has also developed rapidly. The quality of industrial products in socialist countries has been further improved, labor productivity has greatly increased, and the variety of products has expanded.

The working people of People's China are greeting the tenth anniversary of the National Day with new victories on all fronts of socialist construction. The Chinese people are victoriously implementing the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, thereby bringing the day when socialism will achieve complete victory in China ever closer.

The editorial pointed out that in the first half of this year, socialist countries also achieved brilliant achievements in agricultural development. The industry producing consumer goods and food products has been greatly developed in the first half of the year, and millions of working people have moved into well-equipped new houses.

The editorial said that the brilliant achievements in the first half of the year are the result of the selfless and enthusiastic labor of workers, staff, and intellectuals in socialist countries under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and the result of the working people's infinite loyalty to the cause of socialism. The achievements of each socialist country are the achievements of the entire socialist camp. Each country solves its own socialist construction tasks, and at the same time makes a great contribution to the common cause, strengthening the socialist system. This is one of the concrete manifestations of the principle of proletarian internationalism.

The editorial said that socialist builders are the most ardent advocates of peace. This is why the working people of socialist countries heartily welcome the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. They hope that through this visit, the international situation will be eased, and the struggle for lasting world peace will achieve victory.

The people of the powerful socialist world are uniting their ranks more and more closely. They know clearly from historical experience that the more consolidated our fraternal unity, the faster we can achieve our common goal—communism.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th. TASS Geneva, 10th: The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe issued a communique, which analyzed the economic situation of European socialist and capitalist countries. The examples cited in the communique powerfully show that the national economy of socialist countries is developing and consolidating day by day, while the economy of Western European countries continues to stagnate.

The communique particularly emphasized the fact that the general characteristic of the national economic plans of European socialist countries is that the amount of fixed capital investment in 1959 has greatly increased. The communique also pointed out that investment in agriculture and residential construction has also increased.

The communique said that socialist countries have achieved great achievements in industry. The communique pointed out that the industrial product production plan for the first quarter of this year has been successfully completed.

The communique also believes that the annual plan for 1959 will also be successfully completed. The communique specifically mentioned the achievements of major sectors such as the Soviet heavy industry and food industry.

It can be seen from the materials in the communique that the speed of economic development in the entire Western Europe began to slow down as early as 1956, rising by nearly 2% in 1958, while rising by more than 4% in 1957, and by more than 5% in 1956.

The communique pointed out the phenomenon of stagnation in industrial production in Western European countries, and the situation in the metallurgical industry and shipbuilding industry is particularly serious. The situation in the coal industry also makes the drafters of the communique uneasy.

The communique said, "Since the second half of 1957, (Western European) trade volume has not changed." This fact also confirms the stagnation of the economy in Western European capitalist countries.

　　社会主义阵营以雄壮步伐迈向伟大目标
　　苏联“真理报”论述社会主义国家建设的辉煌成就
　　联合国欧洲经委会承认社会主义国家日益繁荣西欧各国继续萧条
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”11日发表了题为“以雄壮的步伐迈向伟大的目标”的社论，评论社会主义国家今年上半年国民经济建设所取得的成就。
    社论指出，苏联和其他社会主义国家在发展经济、文化和提高人民物质福利方面所取得的巨大成就，令人信服地证明社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度。
    社论说，苏联满怀信心地进入了具有历史意义的七年计划时期。苏联人民在党的第二十一次代表大会的决议的鼓舞下，正以自己的劳动干劲来实现全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。苏联上半年的工业生产计划无论在总产值方面、还是在大多数最重要的工业产品的生产方面都超额完成了。工业生产总值比1958年上半年增加了12％。苏联人民得到了比原计划规定还要多的消费品和粮食。他们竭尽全力使共产主义未来早日来到，使祖国更加幸福和富强。
    社论说，各兄弟国家人民在社会主义建设道路上不断获得光荣的胜利。过去的半年标志着社会主义国家工业生产有着突飞猛进的发展。今年头六个月的工业生产同去年同期相比，波兰增长了9.3％，捷克斯洛伐克——11％，德意志民主共和国——12.4％，阿尔巴尼亚——26.1％，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国——75％，越南民主共和国——62.3％，匈牙利——10％，蒙古人民共和国——8.3％。罗马尼亚和保加利亚的工业都得到了迅速的发展。社会主义国家的工业产品质量有了进一步提高，劳动生产率大大提高了，产品品种扩大了。
    人民中国的劳动人民以社会主义建设的各个战线上的新胜利来迎接国庆十周年。中国人民胜利地执行着第二个五年计划的任务，从而使社会主义在中国获得完全胜利的日子日益临近。
    社论指出，今年上半年，社会主义国家在农业发展方面也取得了辉煌的成就。生产消费品和食品的工业在上半年得到了巨大的发展，千百万劳动人民搬进了设备完善的新住宅。
    社论说，上半年的辉煌成果是社会主义国家的工人、职员和知识分子在共产党和工人党的领导下，忘我地热情劳动的结果，是劳动人民无限忠诚于社会主义事业的结果。每一个社会主义国家的成就都是整个社会主义阵营的成就。每一个国家解决本国的社会主义建设任务，同时也就是对共同的事业作出巨大的贡献，加强着社会主义体系。这是无产阶级国际主义原则的具体表现之一。
    社论说，社会主义建设者——这是最衷心拥护和平的人。这就是社会主义国家劳动人民衷心欢迎赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将相互访问的原因。他们希望通过这次访问，国际局势将出现缓和，争取世界持久和平的斗争能取得胜利。
    强大的社会主义世界各国人民日益紧密地团结起自己的队伍。他们从历史经验中清楚地知道，我们各国兄弟般的团结愈是巩固，我们就愈能更快地达到共同目的——共产主义。
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦10日讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会发表一份公报，其中分析了欧洲社会主义国家和资本主义国家的经济状况。公报所援引的例子有力地表明，社会主义国家的国民经济在日益发展和巩固，西欧国家的经济在继续萧条。
    公报特别着重指出了这样一个事实：欧洲社会主义国家国民经济计划总的特点是，1959年的固定资本投资的数量大大增加了。公报同时也指出，对农业和住宅建筑的投资也增加了。
    公报说，社会主义国家在工业方面取得了巨大的成就。公报指出，今年第一季度工业产品生产计划已经顺利完成。
    公报并认为，1959年年度计划也将顺利完成。在公报中特别提到苏联重工业和食品工业等主要部门的成就。
    从公报的材料中可以看出，整个西欧经济发展的速度早在1956年就开始减慢，1958年只上升将近2％，而1957年上升4％以上，1956年上升5％以上。
    公报指出了西欧国家工业生产中的萧条现象，冶金工业和造船工业的状况特别严重。煤炭工业的状况也令公报起草人不安。
    公报说，“从1957年下半年开始，（西欧）贸易量就没有变动。”这一事实也证实了西欧资本主义国家经济的萧条。
