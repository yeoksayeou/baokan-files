　　Talking about Serious Thinking
　　Pi Zhi

　　Whether for study or work, serious thinking is a very important issue. Only through serious thinking can we rise from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and see the essence of problems through phenomena. Conversely, without serious thinking, we become superficial and vague, and even make mistakes. Everyone knows this principle, but knowing it is one thing, and applying it is another.

　　Knowledge is a reflection of objective things. There is a contradiction between the internal connections and external manifestations of objective things, and our understanding is naturally full of contradictions. Serious thinking means discovering and analyzing contradictions according to the internal and external connections of things. There is no ready-made formula for this; only by using dialectical materialism as a weapon and making concrete analysis of specific problems can we achieve the goal of discovering and analyzing contradictions. In order to conduct serious thinking, let's discuss the following aspects:

　　1.  We must understand the situation. Proceeding from the actual situation and handling affairs according to the actual situation is a basic materialist principle that we must follow in dealing with all issues (whether theoretical or practical). To carry out scientific research, it is impossible not to possess a large amount of material; to solve practical work problems, it is impossible not to systematically and thoroughly understand the situation. All subjectivists have suffered from not respecting and understanding the situation. For us dialectical materialists, not respecting the objective situation means not respecting materialism and dialectics. Chairman Mao often taught us to strengthen investigation and research work, and repeatedly emphasized that there is no right to speak without investigation, and that we will inevitably run into snags if we do not handle affairs according to the objective situation. All of this is to make us truly learn to respect and apply materialism and dialectics. Making judgments and deciding on issues without understanding the situation is unscientific and even very dangerous. Treating the individual as the general, the phenomenon as the essence, the tributary as the mainstream, and feelings as policies are all manifestations of subjectivism divorced from reality. In order to understand the situation and truly handle affairs according to the situation, we must constantly struggle against subjectivism.

　　2.  We must understand the causes. Any phenomenon is formed by certain causes. In order to correctly understand this or that phenomenon, we must, on the basis of understanding the situation, look for its causes. Philosophically speaking, it is necessary to understand the cause-and-effect relationship of things. Whether in reading or working, if you only know the result but not the cause, you understand nothing and cannot avoid blindness and superficiality. Those who are good at learning or working often ask one or many "whys" about problems. The question of "why" is precisely to understand the cause. Doing so can not only enable oneself to think deeply about the problem, but also avoid blindness and superficiality. Things are divided into simple and complex, internal and external, primary and secondary, and causes are also divided into simple and complex, internal and external, primary and secondary. In the process of analyzing causes, we must be good at distinguishing and grasping this situation. Whether it is a simple or complex problem, the internal cause plays a decisive role, and its nature is determined by the main aspect of the contradiction. Therefore, we should focus on the internal and primary causes of things, and not abandon the fundamental for the superficial or reverse the primary and secondary. Of course, internal and external causes, primary and secondary causes, are interconnected, and external and secondary causes cannot be ignored either. In short, analyzing the causes of a problem is an important and complex issue that requires careful consideration based on the specific situation. There is a Chinese saying, "prescribe the right medicine for the illness." "Diagnosing the illness" means understanding the cause of the ailment. Only by prescribing medicine on the basis of correct diagnosis can one "bring the dying back to life" and cure the disease. This is the case for treating illnesses, and the same is true for all other issues, which fully illustrates the importance of understanding the cause.

　　3.  We must understand the relationships. Things are interconnected. One of the drawbacks of metaphysics is that it does not look at problems from the mutual connections of things, only seeing the trees and not the forest. We dialectical materialists are different from metaphysicians. We look at problems from the mutual connections and mutual transformations of things, seeing both the trees and the forest. Clarifying the mutual connections and mutual transformations of things means clarifying the issue of relationships. In order to understand relationships, the most important thing is to be good at seeing the internal connections of things, because the internal connections of things play a decisive role in the relationship of things. For example, the relationship between theory and practice is that theory is produced from practice, practice is primary, and theory is secondary. However, theory in turn plays a guiding role in practice. This is the dialectical relationship between theory and practice. A well-known formula to express the dialectical relationship between the two is: practice - theory - practice. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have all understood the relationship between the nine fingers and one finger to a certain extent. This is truly an important link in the application of dialectics in practical life. In our great revolutionary cause, it is impossible to have no mistakes and shortcomings. Without a doubt, we must have a sober mind, promptly face up to and correct mistakes and shortcomings, even if they are extremely minor. However, we should also see the achievements and progress, and specifically measure the proportion of mistakes, shortcomings, achievements, and progress in order not to lose our direction or lose confidence. From the perspective of the entire revolutionary cause, mistakes and shortcomings are often only one finger. In this case, if we do not understand the relationship between the nine fingers and one finger, we will make principled mistakes. At the same time, this certainly does not mean that any mistake by anyone is a one-finger issue. This must be determined based on the specific situation. We say that understanding the relationship between the nine fingers and one finger refers to the fact that achievements are the main thing. In addition, we must not only appropriately recognize the proportional relationship between mistakes and achievements, but also further recognize the transformation relationship between the two under certain conditions. Good things can turn into bad things, and bad things can also turn into good things. Understanding this dialectical relationship of things, we can prevent good things from turning into bad things and strive to turn bad things into good things. In a word, only by understanding the relationships can we effectively apply the law of the unity of opposites.

　　4.  We must understand the essence. In the final analysis, the purpose of serious thinking is nothing more than to understand the essential relationships of things, and to require people to look at problems from the essence. In this sense, the above-mentioned understanding of the situation, causes, and relationships are all for the purpose of understanding the essence of things. As everyone knows, essence and phenomenon are a dialectical unity, and the two are inseparable. The phenomenon is determined by the essence, and the essence can only be expressed through the phenomenon. However, the phenomenon expressing the essence is not so direct or static. That is to say, seeing the essence from the phenomenon is not something that can be seen through at a glance, but requires scientific research and serious thinking. Moving from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge requires a process of mental processing, just as Chairman Mao taught us, requiring a process of distinguishing between true and false, coarse and fine, superficial and internal, and each other, so that we are not confused by phenomena (especially illusions) and can truly grasp the essence. It is impossible to correctly judge right and wrong without looking at problems from the essence. Many mistakes occur because we only look at the phenomenon and not the essence. In order to learn to look at problems from the essence, we must seriously study dialectical materialism. Here, I will only briefly mention three points: First, we must be good at applying the method of class analysis. For the same phenomenon, due to different class positions, some think it is "very good" and some think it is "very bad." In addition, due to not being good at thoroughly implementing the method of class analysis, or lacking a comprehensive analysis of the situation, different conclusions will also be drawn. For example, some believe that it needs to be "started," while others believe that it needs to be "stopped"; some believe that morale can be boosted but not deflated, while others believe that it is better to retreat; some believe that it is the mainstream, while others believe that it is the tributary. All these different views are ultimately related to the position. Therefore, we must firmly implement the method of class analysis in looking at any problem and conduct a comprehensive analysis. Second, we must be good at grasping the dialectical relationship between necessity and chance, and not treat chance as necessity, nor reduce necessity to chance. Truly understanding the relationship between necessity and chance will also clarify the relationship between essence and phenomenon, because essence is the necessary connection in things, and the phenomenon is connected with chance. Third, we must proceed from specific times, places, and conditions, so that we can specifically understand the essence of things and avoid making dogmatic mistakes. Everyone knows a famous saying: Truth is concrete. This means that everything is connected with certain times, places, and conditions. Without specific times, places, and conditions, there can be no existence of specific things. What is correct at this time and place is not necessarily correct at that time and place. Even if it is still correct, due to the different times, places, and conditions, it will inevitably have its own characteristics. In other words, it is impossible to recognize the particularity of things without looking at problems from specific times, places, and conditions. Without recognizing the particularity, it is impossible to truly recognize the universality of things. Therefore, in order to understand the essence, we must make specific analyses of problems based on different times, places, and conditions.

　　From an epistemological point of view, practice, knowledge, re-practice, and re-knowledge is a general formula for us to understand and transform the world, and it is naturally no exception in the issue of learning and training thinking. We must seriously follow this general formula. People who do not pay attention to serious thinking often attribute the reason to "low level" and "improper methods." In fact, this is a misunderstanding. It is undeniable that "low level" and "improper methods" will indeed affect the ability and effect of thinking to a certain extent, but this is not the key to the problem. Anyone with strong thinking ability has his or her own learning and training process. There is no one who is good at thinking without effort. So this idea is unrealistic. As long as we are willing to use our brains, learn more about the situation, think more about problems, study more theory, and accumulate more experience, we will gradually develop the habit of serious thinking and continuously improve our thinking ability.

　　谈认真思考
　　丕之
    不论对学习或工作来说，认真思考都是一个十分重要的问题。只有认真思考，才能从感性认识上升到理性认识，才能通过现象看出问题的本质。反之，不认真思考，就肤浅，就模糊，甚至会发生错误。这个道理谁都知道，可是，知道是一回事，运用又是一回事。
    认识是客观事物的反映。客观事物中的内在联系和外在表现之间是有矛盾的，我们的认识自然也是充满了矛盾的。认真思考也就是要按照事物的内在联系和外在联系来发现矛盾和分析矛盾；这是没有现成公式的，只有以辩证唯物主义为武器，对具体问题作具体分析，才能达到发现矛盾和分析矛盾的目的。为了进行认真思考，我们谈谈以下几个方面的问题。
    一、要弄清情况。从实际情况出发，按照实际情况办事，这是我们对待一切问题（不论是理论问题或实际问题）必须遵循的一条基本的唯物主义原则。为了进行科学研究工作，不大量占有材料是不行的；为了解决实际工作问题，不系统地详细地了解情况是不行的。一切主观主义者，都吃了不尊重情况和不了解情况的亏。对我们辩证唯物主义者来说，不尊重客观情况，就是不尊重唯物主义和辩证法。毛主席经常教导我们要加强调查研究工作，一再强调没有调查就没有发言权，不按照客观情况办事，非碰壁不可，都是为了使我们真正学会尊重和运用唯物主义和辩证法。不弄清情况，就下判断，就决定问题，是不科学的，甚至是很危险的。把个别当成一般，把现象当成了本质，把支流当成了主流，把感想当成了政策，都是一种脱离实际的主观主义的表现。为了弄清情况，真正做到按照情况办事，必须经常与主观主义作斗争。
    二、要弄清原因。任何现象都是由一定的原因形成的，为了正确认识这种或那种现象，就必须在弄清情况的基础上，去寻找它的原因。从哲学上来说，就是要弄清事物的因果关系。不论是读书或工作，如果只知结果，不知原因，就什么也不理解，就无法避免盲目性和表面性。善于学习或工作的人，经常对问题要问一个或许多个
  “为什么”。“为什么”的问题，正是为了弄清原因，这样做既可使自己对问题作深入的思考，又可使自己避免盲目性和表面性。事物有简单与复杂、内与外、主与次之分，原因也有简单与复杂、内与外、主与次之分，在分析原因的过程中，必须善于区别和掌握这种情况。不论是简单或复杂的问题，都是内因起决定作用，它的性质都是由矛盾的主要方面决定的，因此我们要着重注意事物的内在原因和主要原因，不要舍本求末、主次颠倒。当然，内因和外因、主因和次因，都是相互联系着的，也不可忽略外因和次因。总之，分析问题的原因，是一个既重要而又复杂的问题，必须根据具体情况，多用心想一想才行。我国有句俗语叫“对症下药”，“对症”就是要弄清楚病症的原因，在对症的基础上下药，才能“妙手回春”，药到病除。治病如此，其他一切问题也都如此，这充分说明弄清原因的重要。
    三、要弄清关系。事物是相互联系着的，形而上学的弊端之一就是不从事物的相互联系上看问题，只见树木，不见森林。我们辩证唯物主义者与形而上学者不同，我们是从事物的相互联系和相互转化上看问题的，既见树木，又见森林。弄清事物的相互联系和相互转化，也就是弄清关系的问题。为了弄清关系，最重要的是要善于看出事物的内在联系，因为事物内在联系对事物的关系起决定作用。比如理论与实践的关系，理论是由实践中产生的，实践是第一性的，理论是第二性的，但是反过来理论对实践又起指导作用，这便是理论与实践的辩证关系。用一条公式来表达二者的辩证关系，那就是众所周知的：实践——理论——实践。大跃进以来，在党中央和毛主席的教导下，我们都在一定程度上懂得了九个指头和一个指头的关系，这对辩证法在实际生活中的运用说来，实在是一个重要环节。在我们伟大的革命事业中，一点错误和缺点没有是不可能的，毫无疑问，我们要有清醒的头脑，要及时正视并且改正错误和缺点，哪怕是极微小的缺点。但是，我们更应该看到成绩和进步，要具体衡量一下错误、缺点和成绩、进步的比重，才不致迷失方向、丧失信心。从整个革命事业来看，错误和缺点往往只不过是一个指头而已，在这种情况下，如果弄不清九个指头和一个指头的关系，就会犯原则性的错误。同时，这当然不是说，任何人的任何错误，都是一个指头的问题，这是要看具体情况才能确定的。我们说弄清九个指头和一个指头的关系，是指着成绩是主要的而说的。另外，我们不仅要恰当地认识错误和成绩的比例关系，并且还要进一步认识二者在一定条件下的转化关系。好事可以转化成坏事，坏事也可以转成好事。懂得了事物的这种辩证关系，我们就可以防止好事转化为坏事，争取坏事转化为好事。一句话说，只有弄清了关系，才能有效地运用对立统一的法则。
    四、要弄清本质。归根结蒂说来，认真思考的目的无非在于弄清事物的本质关系，无非是要求人们从本质上看问题。从这个意义上说，上面所说的弄清情况、原因、关系，都是为了弄清事物的本质。大家都知道，本质和现象是辩证的统一，二者是不可分割的。现象是由本质决定的，而本质只有通过现象才能表现出来。但是，现象表现本质，并不是那么直接，那么静止，也就是说，由现象看本质，并不是一眼就可望穿的，而是需要一番科学研究和认真思考的。由感性认识到理性认识，是需要一个思想加工的过程，正像毛主席所教导我们的，需要一个分辨真伪、粗精、表里、彼此的过程，这样才能不为现象（特别是假象）所迷惑，才能真正抓住本质。不从本质上看问题，就不可能正确地判断是非，许多错误就是由于只看现象不看本质而发生的。为了学会从本质看问题，必须认真学习辩证唯物主义，这里只简单提及三点：第一，要善于运用阶级分析方法。同一现象，由于阶级立场不同，有的认为“好得很”，有的认为“糟得很”。另外由于不善于把阶级分析方法贯彻到底，或者是对情况缺乏全面的分析，也会得出不同的结论，如有的认为需要“上马”，有的认为需要“下马”；有的认为气可鼓不可泄，有的认为还是打退堂鼓的好；有的认为是主流，有的认为是支流。这种种不同的看法，归根到底都与立场有关。因此，看任何问题都必须紧紧地贯彻阶级分析的方法，进行全面地分析。第二，要善于掌握必然性和偶然性的辩证关系，不要把偶然性当成了必然性，也不要把必然性降低为偶然性。真正弄清楚必然性和偶然性的关系，也就会弄清楚本质和现象的关系，因为本质就是事物中的必然性的联系，现象是和偶然性联系着的。第三，要从具体的时间、地点和条件出发，这样才能具体认识事物的本质，才不致于犯教条主义的错误。大家都知道一句名言：真理是具体的。这就是说，任何事物都和一定的时间、地点、条件联系着的，离开了具体的时间、地点和条件，也就不可能有具体事物的存在。在此时此地正确的东西，在彼时彼地就不一定是正确的东西，即使仍然是正确的，由于时间、地点和条件的不同，也必然会有它的特点。换句话说，看问题不从具体的时间、地点和条件出发，就不可能认识事物的特殊性，不认识特殊性，也就不可能真正认识事物的普遍性。因此，为了弄清本质，就必须依据不同的时间、地点和条件，对问题作具体分析。
    从认识论来说，实践、认识、再实践、再认识，是我们认识世界和改造世界的一条总公式，在学习和锻炼思考的问题上，自然也不例外，必须认真遵循这条总公式。不注意认真思考的人，常常把原因归咎于“水平低”和“不得法”上去，其实，这是一种误解。不可否认，“水平低”和“不得法”，在一定程度上，确实会影响思考的能力和效果，但这不是问题的关键所在。任何思考力强的人，都有其自己的学习和锻炼的过程，不费力气就善于思考的人是没有的。所以这种想法是不合乎实际的。只要我们肯于开动脑筋，多了解情况，多想问题，多学习理论，多积累经验，就会逐渐养成认真思考的习惯，就会不断地提高自己的思考能力。
