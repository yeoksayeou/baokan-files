　　Ulan Bator, August 10 (By Our Correspondent) – The work of Mongolian agricultural cooperative members re-enlisting their surplus privately-owned livestock into the cooperatives has basically concluded. According to statistical materials received by the Mongolian Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry from some provinces, after members re-enlisted their privately-owned livestock, publicly-owned livestock now accounts for more than 70% of all livestock.
　　The current model charter of agricultural cooperatives, adopted in 1955, stipulates that each herdsman household in the Hangai and Gobi regions may keep one hundred to one hundred and fifty head of private livestock. Due to the excessive number of privately-owned livestock, it affected the members' participation in cooperative labor and the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. Therefore, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Council of Ministers instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry to revise the limit for members' privately-owned livestock, stipulating that each household could keep fifty to seventy-five head of livestock, and submitted this new decision to all members for discussion in early July. After full discussion, the members voluntarily re-enlisted their surplus privately-owned livestock into the cooperatives. Currently, the members' privately-owned livestock does not exceed the prescribed limit.

    本报乌兰巴托10日电　蒙古农牧业合作社社员自留牲畜再入社的工作，已经基本结束。根据蒙古农牧业部收到的一些省份的统计材料，社员自留牲畜再入社后，公有牲畜已占全部牲畜的70％以上。
    1955年通过的现行农牧业合作社示范章程规定，杭爱和戈壁地区每户牲民的自留牲畜为一百到一百五十头。由于自留牲畜过多，影响了社员参加合作社的劳动和农牧业生产的发展。因此，蒙古人民革命党和部长会议责成农牧业部修改社员自留牲畜的限额，规定每户可自留五十到七十五头牲畜，并在7月初把这一新决定交由全体社员讨论。社员们经过充分讨论后，自愿将多余的自留牲畜再行入社。现在社员的自留牲畜都没有超过规定的限额。
