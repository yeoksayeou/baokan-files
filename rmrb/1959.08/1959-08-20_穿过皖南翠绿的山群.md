　　Traveling Through the Green Mountains of Southern Anhui...
　　Yan Zhen

　　Traveling through the verdant mountains of southern Anhui, the red long-distance bus is speeding along. A young woman sits beside me, a mother of three children. The newly opened road is a smear of light yellow, and the bus bounces like a spirited horse, sometimes throwing the passengers high in the air, and sometimes violently tossing them back onto their seats. The young woman leans against the green bus window, smiling and gazing into the distance, seemingly unconcerned about the bumpy and turbulent journey. After gazing out the window for a while, she turns around and talks enthusiastically with the people, combing her black hair that has been ruffled by the wind, letting the swirling yellow dust cover her clothes. From her bright and straightforward conversation, I learned that she is a skilled lathe operator who left Shanghai a few years ago, when she was still a playful student. Now she has three children, all three of whom were born in the midst of a boiling life: one in the Fozi Ridge, one in the Meishan, and one in the Xianghongdian, she said, her face glowing with pride. I asked her where she was going now? She pointed to the distant, brightly lit mountain peaks. The giant Chencun Hydropower Station is about to be built there, and she is rushing to build this new project... Traveling through the verdant mountains of southern Anhui, the red long-distance bus is speeding along. A young woman sits beside me, a mother of three children.

　　穿过皖南翠绿的山群……
　　严阵穿过皖南翠绿的山群，红色的长途汽车正在飞奔，一个少妇坐在我的身边，她是三个孩子的母亲。新开的公路一抹淡黄，汽车像烈性的马一样跳荡，它一会把车上的人扔起多高，一会又猛烈地抛到坐位上。那个少妇斜倚着绿色的车窗，微笑着微笑着望着远方，对这颠簸动荡的旅途生活，好像一点也没有放在心上。她靠着车窗眺望一会，又转过身来热情地和人们谈讲，她用手梳理着被风吹乱的黑发，任那翻卷的黄尘落满衣裳。从她明快爽直的谈吐里面，我知道她是一个熟练的车工，她是在几年以前离开了上海，那时候还是一个顽皮的学生。如今她已经有了三个孩子，三个孩子全是在沸腾的生活里诞生：一个在佛子岭，一个在梅山，一个在响洪甸，她说时，脸上洋溢着骄傲的感情。我问她现在要到什么地方？她指指远处那灯火辉煌的山峰，巨型的陈村水电站就要在那儿建立，她是赶来建设这新的工程……穿过皖南翠绿的山群，红色的长途汽车正在飞奔，一个少妇坐在我的身边，她是三个孩子的母亲。
