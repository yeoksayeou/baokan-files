The True Qualities of a Communist Party Member
　　Sun Zunian

    Communist Party members are active and enthusiastic proletarian fighters; the Party's policies, resolutions, and various undertakings are realized through the efforts of Party members leading the broad masses. Therefore, every Communist Party member is required to display initiative, proactiveness, and creativity in their work, and to become a model for the masses. The Communist Party members of the structural workshop at the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory truly live up to the glorious title of Communist Party members. Look! When the workshop faced a shortage of materials, and the workers experienced a slackening of enthusiasm in production, Communist Party members Cui Dianlin, Zuo Shuwen, Zhao Zhe, and others stepped forward first. They were not afraid of trouble, took blueprints to search for raw materials in the scrap heaps, actively proposed suggestions for technical innovation, and engaged in research and creation during their spare time. The cantilever crane created using waste materials increased the efficiency of transporting steel plates fivefold and saved four-fifths of the manpower, thereby boosting the enthusiasm of the workers and overcoming difficulties such as a shortage of raw materials, excellently completing the production tasks. They not only walked in front of the masses on the production front but also played a model role in contacting the masses, caring about their lives, and helping them improve their political awareness and technical skills.
    This is the true nature of a Communist Party member. The so-called true nature of a Communist Party member means that Communist Party members are different from the masses. This difference is not special, not superior. It is about putting the interests of the Party above personal interests, working diligently and honestly, struggling hard, uniting the broad masses, and overcoming all difficulties; it is about being the first to worry about the troubles of the world and the last to enjoy its pleasures, enduring hardship before enjoying comfort. The Party members of the structural workshop at the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory truly possess the qualities that revolutionaries should have in their attitude toward the Party's socialist construction. Therefore, their drive is sky-high, and they can overcome all difficulties and leap forward.
    Resolutely implementing the Party's resolutions and proactively and creatively completing the various tasks assigned by the Party is a Communist Party member's bounden duty. However, in real life, there are often two attitudes toward the Party's resolutions and the various tasks assigned by the Party: one is a proactive and positive attitude; the other is a passive and negative attitude. There is no doubt that the former attitude should be adopted toward the Party's resolutions and work, just like the Party members of the structural workshop at the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory. Whether in a smooth or difficult environment, whether under the supervision of the Party or without Party supervision, one should consciously possess the heroic spirit of firmness, courage, tenacity, and indomitable perseverance to complete the various tasks assigned by the Party. Those who are sluggish, mediocre, unwilling to use their brains, and shrink back in the face of difficulties will never do a good job. We should emulate the former type of Communist Party member, constantly using their selfless model actions as our example, and help the latter type of people overcome their fear of difficulties, boost their spirits, and move forward together.

    共产党员的本色
　　孙祖年
    共产党员是积极、热情的无产阶级战士；党的政策、决议和各项事业是经过党员带动广大群众实现的。因此，要求每一个共产党员在工作中发挥积极性、主动性和创造性，要求成为群众的模范。北京起重机器厂结构车间的共产党员们，真不辜负共产党员的光荣称号。你看！当车间因材料供应不足，职工们在生产中存在松劲情绪的时候，共产党员崔殿林、左树文、赵哲等首先挺身而出。他们不怕麻烦地拿着图纸到废料堆里找原料，积极地提出技术革新建议，业余时间也在研究、创造。利用废料创造出的悬臂吊，提高搬运钢板效率五倍，节省人力五分之四，从而鼓舞了职工群众的干劲，克服了原材料不足等困难，出色地完成了生产任务。他们不仅在生产战线上走在群众的前面，而且在联系群众，关心群众生活，帮助群众提高政治思想、技术水平方面，也都发挥了共产党员的模范作用。
    这是共产党员的本色。所谓共产党员的本色，就是说共产党员是与众不同的。这种不同，不是特殊，不是高人一等。而是把党的利益放在个人利益之上，勤勤恳恳，老老实实，艰苦奋斗，团结广大群众，战胜一切困难；应该是先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐，吃苦在先，享福在后。北京起重机器厂结构车间的党员们，对待党的社会主义建设事业，真正是具备了这种革命者应有的品质。因此，他们的干劲冲天，能够战胜一切困难，向前跃进。
    坚决执行党的决议，主动地创造性地完成党所分配的各项任务，这是一个共产党员应尽的义务。但在实际生活中，对待党的决议和党所分配的各项任务，往往也有两种态度：一种是主动的、积极的态度；一种是被动的、消极的态度。毫无疑问，应当以前一种态度对待党的决议和工作，也就是像北京起重机器厂结构车间的党员们一样，不论在顺利的或是困难的环境下，不论是在有党的监督或没有党监督的情况下，都应当自觉地有坚定、勇敢、顽强、百折不挠的英雄气概，来完成党所交给的各项任务。那种萎靡不振、得过且过，不肯动用脑子，在困难面前畏缩的人，是永远也不会做好工作的。我们应该向前一种共产党员看齐，时刻以他们忘我的模范行动，作为自己的表率；并帮助后一种人克服畏难情绪，鼓起劲来，一同前进。
