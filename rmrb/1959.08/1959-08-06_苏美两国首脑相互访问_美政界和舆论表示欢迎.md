Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 5th: According to TASS, the upcoming visit of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to the United States is the biggest political event in the American capital on the 4th. All Washington newspapers have published lengthy editorials and articles by their reporters on this issue. The consistent tone of these reactions indicates that the mere news of the mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States has already warmed the political atmosphere in Washington.

Most members of Congress support Khrushchev's visit to the United States. Senate Democratic Leader Johnson believes that this mutual visit is an "event that can greatly contribute to the world."

It is worth noting that Willie, one of the most senior members of the U.S. Congress (who often speaks about international issues from the standpoint of a Cold War advocate), also supports the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. He believes that this mutual visit "is an unprecedented step in world politics, and it will definitely ease the tension between the East and the West."

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" pointed out in a lengthy editorial that the mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower "will lay the foundation for future effective cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States," and that such visits are also "the prelude to a series of top-level meetings."

An editorial in "The New York Times" emphasized that "this top-level mutual visit (which is the result of lower-level mutual visits and lengthy negotiations conducted in full consultation with our allies) is widely approved, even enthusiastically welcomed, both at home and abroad." The newspaper hinted that "if this mutual visit can prompt the Soviet Union to allow sufficient progress in negotiations to show that a top-level meeting is worthwhile, then the visit may pave the way for an East-West summit. However, there will be no actual negotiations during the visit." Therefore, this newspaper reflects the intentions and hopes of those who hope that the Soviet Union will make unilateral concessions to the demands of the West.

    苏美两国首脑相互访问
    美政界和舆论表示欢迎
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿4日讯：对苏联部长会议主席即将访问美国的反应是美国首都4日最大的政治事件。所有华盛顿报纸都就这个问题发表了长篇社论和它们的记者的文章。这些反应的一致的声调表明，光是苏美两国首脑相互访问的消息就已经引起了华盛顿政治气氛的暖化。
    大多数议员都赞成赫鲁晓夫访问美国。参议院民主党领袖约翰逊认为这次相互访问是一件可以“对全世界有很大贡献的事件”。
    值得注意的是，美国国会资格最老的议员之一维利（这个人常常站在冷战鼓吹者的立场谈论国际问题）也支持赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔相互访问。他认为，这次相互访问“是世界政治中的空前未有的一个步骤，它一定会缓和东西方的紧张关系”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在长篇社论中指出，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的相互访问“将为苏美两国将来有效的合作”奠定基础，这种访问同时也是“举行一系列最高级会议的序幕曲”。
    “纽约时报”的一篇社论强调指出，“这次最高级的相互访问（这是比较低级的互相访问和在同我们的盟国充分协商的条件下进行长时间谈判的结果）受到普遍赞同，甚至受到国内外的热烈欢迎。”报纸暗示说，“如果这次相互访问能够促使苏联容许谈判有足够的进展以说明最高级会议是值得举行的，那末访问就可能为东西方最高级会议铺平道路。但是，在访问期间不会有任何实际的谈判。”因此，这家报纸反映了这样一些人士的打算和希望，他们希望苏联对西方的要求作出单方面的让步。
