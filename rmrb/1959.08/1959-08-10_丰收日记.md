    Harvest Diary
    Tu Yixun, Deputy Secretary of the An'yi County Party Committee, Jiangxi Province
    Early rice harvesting happens every year, but this year is different. Good news of bumper harvests keeps coming one after another, impacting everyone's heartstrings, giving people endless joy and great encouragement, and making this bright pearl—the people's commune—shine even more brightly. Coinciding with this period, the county party committee decided to send me down to the Longjin People's Commune to be a commune member, participate in actual labor, and experience it more deeply, which has left my mood unsettled for a long time. I wrote a few diary entries during the early rice harvest.
    July 2nd
    The weather is so unpredictable, one moment the mountains are shrouded in heavy fog, as if the sky is about to fall, and bean-sized raindrops beat against people's bodies with a clanging sound in the strong wind; the next moment, the smoke dissipates and the sky is clear for ten thousand miles. The Yunzhuang Production Team is harvesting early rice. Here, there is a lively young man named Shuai Zhengbao, bare-chested and wearing shorts, shuttling back and forth in the heavy rain, threshing and reaping. Behind him is a girl with two long braids, dark skin, and bright eyes, who is reaping intently. She glances at Zhengbao, his hair and eyebrows are wet, and sweat and rain are mixed together on his back, flowing down as if he has been soaked in water. She says to Zhengbao, "Why don't you go and change your clothes? Do you want to pay back medical debts in the future?" I deliberately joked with her, "You only care about Zhengbao, don't you care about yourself?" causing the girl to blush. Zhengbao is reaping in the storm, secretly competing with me to see who is more energetic and whether I can persevere. I also secretly encouraged myself. I have done heavy and light work in the wind and rain. Don't underestimate me as a cadre. The two of us persevered in reaping and threshing in the heavy rain, neither of us falling behind.
    July 4th
    The male and female commune members of the He’shang Production Team are all reaping that Douliu plot. Chen Jinghua, the commune's production cadre, is also threshing here. Everyone can't wait to finish reaping this plot of land in one go, to see how much grain it can actually yield. Why is everyone so concerned about the yield of this plot of land? It turns out that three or four days ago, the commune members were sitting around the threshing floor enjoying the cool air in the evening and "calculated the fate" of the early rice yield of this plot. Last year, this "Douliu" was planted with Nan Te variety and harvested eight baskets of grain, but this year it is planted with Liantang Early. How much can it yield? Everyone wanted to test their eyesight. Some estimated seven baskets, some estimated eight baskets. Finally, commune member Yang Yuanmu determined that this plot could yield a maximum of four hundred catties this year. In the past, Yuanmu's yield estimation was quite accurate, and the difference would not exceed twenty catties.
    The rice is indeed good. The ears of grain are heavy and drooping, and the golden grains are hanging down like strings of pearls. When threshed on the threshing barrel, there is only a "tong sha..." sound, and the barrel is covered with a layer of grains. With one turn, there are half a dozen threshing barrels, and two baskets are piled up. When eight baskets were piled up, there was still a large area in the field that had not been threshed. Finally, a total of nine and a half baskets of grain were threshed. Chen Jinghua smiled and asked Yuanmu, "Is it okay?" "Almost."
    "Hey! Almost. Didn't you say that it would yield less grain than last year? How could even an experienced estimator go wrong?" Yuanmu stopped speaking, his face flushed, causing everyone to laugh.
    July 5th
    The last ray of sunlight fell on the earth. Lao Wang and I went to the river to take a bath. He told me the story of the commune secretary Wang Xiushou's reaping competition with "Bu Rang Ren".
    "Bu Rang Ren" is Huang Donglian, a female commune member of the Tangxia Team. She looks no more than twenty-two or three years old, with a dark face and a strong body. At first glance, you can tell that she is a "capable general". In fact, this is the case. She is always vigorous when working. Last year, when county office cadres were reaping rice in the Xilu Brigade, she defeated many people in the competition. She hasn't met a real opponent in reaping so far this year.
    One day, Secretary Wang went to the Tangxia Team to reap rice, and she set her sights on Secretary Wang, looking like she wanted to have a competition with him. Some people next to her were worried, knowing that Secretary Wang was good at farming, how could she beat him? But some people were secretly happy, wanting her to run into a stone and suffer a defeat, so that she wouldn't always call herself "hot". Truly, a newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger, and she started working as soon as she said so. Secretary Wang only reaped casually at first, but he didn't expect her to be watching behind him, and she caught up in the blink of an eye. She shouted, "Secretary Wang, why don't you hurry up!" "You want to compete with me!" "No! I didn't reap this fast in previous years. This year the rice grows well, so it can't be reaped slowly. Besides, didn't you say that we should complete the double harvest and rush planting mission three days after the Great Heat? How can we do it without speed? I don't dare to compete with you to reap fast, but I want to compete with you in energy!" At this time, both of them unanimously increased their speed. All that could be heard was the "swish swish swish" of the sickles. Before they could see how the rice was reaped, it fell down. In an instant, a large area was reaped. The two of them went ashore at the same time, without raising their heads or stretching their waists, considering it a "tie". Neither of them was willing to admit defeat, so they started the second and third rounds of competition...
    July 6th
    The threshing barrel has been sounding for several days.
    After reaping rice for a day, I felt sore in my back. Strange, last year I participated in the rush harvest and rush planting for twelve days, getting up at four o'clock in the morning to reap, thresh, dry, carry, and plant, working until eleven o'clock at night, and I didn't feel tired. Actually, there is nothing strange about it. The first year after communization, the growth of early rice is very different from last year. The early rice I reaped in Zhongzhou and Baishu had golden rice stalks, row by row, plant by plant, with thick stalks, large clumps, and long ears. I also harvested here last year. It was harvesting multi-clumped rice, and it took more than twenty clumps to make a handful. This year, seven or eight clumps make a handful. The Hunan sickle I used could not handle these early rice with large clumps and thick stalks. The feeling of carrying grain is also different. This year, the grain pressed on my shoulders like carrying a load of stones, and I couldn't straighten my waist. When I carried it to the threshing ground, it weighed 170 to 180 catties. No wonder some commune members asked me, "This year's early rice is particularly good and difficult to reap. You should also discuss some solutions with the cadres." Yes, it's time to think of a solution, quickly launch a high-efficiency movement, and find energy and skill from the masses. Otherwise, it will really prolong the season.
    Tiredness is not just my feeling. Everyone who participated in the harvest feels tired. But the bumper harvest made me smile involuntarily. The bumper harvest is brought about by the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. I took out a cigarette that had been soaked in sweat from my shorts and smoked it, feeling an indescribable deliciousness.
    July 8th
    Xiong Mujin, a commune member of the Fifth Team of the Baishu Brigade who is fifty years old and skilled in farming, can't quickly grasp new things, but the facts of the bumper harvest are in front of him, and his thinking has completely changed. I was threshing rice in the same threshing barrel with Mujin. He said to me interestingly, "You haven't been here for a short time. Since the establishment of the mutual aid group, you have been with us, spring plowing and autumn harvest, for five years. You have a record in your heart of the annual yield of each field and each slope. As for me, I have been farming since I was only as tall as a table. In the ten years since liberation, the harvest has been better year by year, but I have never encountered such a large-scale early rice bumper harvest year like this year. This year is like catching a big carp!" Saying this, he held up the heavy ears of grain, the golden, pearl-like grains for me to see, "How heavy is this?" I asked if the early rice could increase production this year. He said with confidence, "Don't panic, I'll take care of the accounting." In the evening, he pulled me to his house for dinner, specially preparing field snail meat for me. The taste of field snails in summer is delicious. Eating dinner on the threshing floor in the moonlight feels particularly flavorful. We ate and chatted, talking about a lot of things, but the theme was still the bumper harvest. This night really allowed me to share a lot of the joy of the bumper harvest.
    July 10th
    Last night was hot, and I couldn't sleep lying in bed. When the rooster crowed for the first time, I got up and quietly walked out of Baishu New Village to admire the night scene. The moonlight had already gone down the mountain, and the stars filled the sky, and everything was vaguely visible. I thought I was the earliest person to get up today. At this time, I suddenly heard the sound of shouting cattle coming from the south slope opposite me. I looked up and saw two black shadows squirming. When I got closer, it was really "Don't say you walk early, there are people who walk even earlier." It turned out to be the old commune members Fu Denghuai and Zhang Lao Si of the Hexia Team plowing the fields. I asked them why they were so early. They deliberately joked with me, "Old people don't sleep much. They can't sleep at night. They roll around in bed and wear out their shirts and mats." I also joked, "Are you angry with the old woman? Get up early and get some fresh air?"
    Fu Denghuai's family has ten people: the old couple, four sons, two daughters, a daughter-in-law, and a grandson. Except for himself, his eldest son, and his daughter-in-law, who are laborers, the others are either old or young, and can only eat but not work. Old Man Denghuai is a diligent person, but his burden is too heavy. Before communization, he was busy all year round, but at the end of the year, he was still a grain-deficient household. The days before liberation were even worse. After communization, his family's economic situation underwent a "reversal of fortune." In addition to eating, they can also receive ten or eight yuan of pocket money every month. Life is getting better and better, how can their enthusiasm not become more and more sufficient?
    July 11th
    The stars filled the sky, a crescent moon hung obliquely, the heat gradually disappeared from the ground, and a slight south wind blew on my face. After working for a day, I felt a little tired. Everything was quiet around me. Zhang Hongjun, the secretary of the Fengshan Brigade branch, and I came to the river, wanting to take a refreshing cold shower. I lay sideways on the shallow sandy beach, as soft as sleeping on a sofa. The cool river water rushed over my body, making me feel very comfortable. He asked me with concern, "Are you tired?" I casually said, "A little tired." I then asked him:
  "Are you tired?" Obviously, my question was a bit superfluous. I know that he is a person who never knows fatigue, and his dark and broad back shone in the moonlight and starlight. He replied, "I'm not tired." He is always so tireless, as if there is a huge force supporting him behind him. His voice is like a bell, and his laughter is hearty. His talkativeness was unleashed and washed away my tiredness: "I have been a cadre for ten years, and I have never seen such rapid changes from the day the commune was established, like watching a magic lantern! The lives of the commune members have begun to improve. This spring, the brigade developed diversified operations, and the spring-ripe crops have had a bumper harvest. In addition, by saving costs and reducing expenses in running the commune, in just half a year, almost every household of the two hundred and seventeen commune members in the entire brigade has spare money. If it weren't for the credit cooperative, there would be nowhere to put the money."
    I interjected casually, "How is your family?" I knew that his family situation was not good, and six people depended on his hands alone for food.
    "My family has also changed. In the past, there was not much income. This year, in just half a year, we have also been allocated fifty-seven yuan." Saying this, in order to make me believe even more in the changes in the Fengshan Brigade, he continued to say to me, "Don't look at our poor Fengshan with old eyes! In the past, girls were unwilling to marry here. It would suffer drought for three days of sunny weather, and it would become a disaster for three days of rainy weather. It was a hard life, a poor foundation, and the income could only sustain the year for one year. Now our wallets are hard, our foundation is solid, and the word 'poor' has been torn from our heads! Now girls from neighboring villages are running to Fengshan to look for objects, but our young men are talking about the 'condition theory', picking and choosing, and wanting to test the girl's true feelings." Then he counted the names of the young commune members who had recently married, including Xiang Shuzhen, Zhang Hongchun, Zhang Daifu... a series of names, almost making me unable to remember them. He spoke as if he had forgotten that he was taking a bath in the river. I suggested that after he finished taking a bath, we move the bamboo bed together and talk in detail.

    丰收日记
    中共江西省安义县委副书记　涂益训
    早稻收刈，年年都有，独有今年不同，丰收喜讯接二连三传来，冲击着每个人的心弦，给人们无穷的喜悦和巨大的鼓舞，更使这颗明亮的珍珠——人民公社闪闪发光。恰逢这个时期，县委决定我下放到龙津人民公社当社员，参加实际劳动，体验更深，使我的心情，久久不能平静，在早稻丰收时，记了几段日记。
    七月二日
    天气是这样的令人难以捉摸，一时山雾重重，似乎天都要掉下，豆子大的雨点随着狂风打着人们身上铿然有声；一时又烟消云散，万里晴空。云庄生产小组正在收刈早稻。在这里有位生龙活虎的小伙子帅征保，光着膀子，穿条短裤头，在大雨中穿梭地来回，打禾、刈禾。在他身后有位梳着两条长辫，皮肤浅黑，眼睛豁亮的姑娘，低着头儿唰唰地在刈禾。她瞧征保一眼，头发上眉毛上都是湿漉漉的，背上汗水和雨水搅在一起往下流，活像从水里泡出来的一样。她对征保说：“你还不去换换衣裳，将来想还病债么？”我故意和她开玩笑说：“你就关心征保，连自己也不顾了？”弄得那位姑娘羞红了脸。征保冒着狂风暴雨刈禾，是在暗暗和我比干劲，看我是否坚持得住。我也暗自鼓劲，在风雨中，重活、轻活我都干过，别小看我这个干部。两人各不松劲地坚持在大雨中刈禾、打禾，一直干了四小时，谁都没有掉队。
    七月四日
    鹤上生产小组男女社员都在刈那个斗六丘。公社生产干事陈敬华也在这里打禾。大家巴不得将这丘田一口气刈完，看看到底能收几多谷。对这丘田的产量，大家为什么这样关心？原来在三、四天前的一个晚上，社员们正围坐在禾坪上乘凉，对这丘田早禾的产量“算了一个命”。去年这个“斗六”，栽的是南特号，刈了八箩谷，而今年栽的莲塘早，能收多少呢？大家都想试试眼色。有的估七箩，有的估八箩，最后社员杨垣沐断定了这丘田，今年最多能刈四百斤。过去垣沐估产是有两下子的，眼高眼低不会差二十斤。
    禾确实好，谷穗沉甸甸，金黄的谷粒像成串珍珠似的倒挂着，在打禾桶上打下去，只听得“通沙……”一声响，桶里就铺上一层谷粒，一个转身就有半打禾桶，扒上来有两箩。扒到八箩了，田内还有一大片没打，最后一共打到九箩半谷。陈敬华笑着问垣沐：“还好吗？”“差不多”。
    “嘿！差不多。你不是说比去年要少收些谷，怎么估产老手也走了把？”垣沐不再做声了，脸上红辣辣的，惹得大家都笑起来。
    七月五日
    太阳最后一道霞光，撒落在大地上。我和老王到河里去洗澡，他和我谈起公社书记王修寿与“不让人”的刈禾比武的故事。
    “不让人”是塘下组女社员黄冬莲，看来不过二十二、三岁，黑朴朴的脸膛，健壮的身躯，一见面就可看出是个“能将”。事实上也是这样，劳动起来总是泼泼辣辣，去年县里机关干部在西路大队刈禾时，她赛败了很多人。今年刈禾到现在还没遇上真正的对手。
    有一天，王书记到塘下组去刈禾，她就盯住了王书记，看样子要和王书记比一场。旁边的人有些担心，都知道王书记作田是把好手，她怎能比得过？但也有人暗暗高兴，让她碰碰石头，吃个败仗，免得她总是称“辣”。真是初生牛犊不怕虎，说干就干起来了。王书记开始只是随手刈，没想到她盯在背后，眨眼就赶上来了。她叫着：“王书记，你还不快点！”“你要和我比呀！”“不！往年刈也没这样快，今年禾长得好，不快刈不行。另外，你不是说大暑后三天要我们完成双收抢插的任务吗，不快怎行？比刈得快我是不敢同你比，不过，我想和你比比干劲！”这时两人都不约而同地加了马力，只听见镰刀“唰唰唰”的响，还没看清这头禾是怎样刈脱的，那头又刈倒了。一刹时，刈倒了一大片，两人同时上岸，头都没抬，腰都没伸一下，算打个“平手”。两人互不服输，他们又展开了二场、三场比赛……。
    七月六日
    打禾桶响了好几天了。
    白天刈了一天禾，晚上觉得腰酸背痛。奇怪，去年我参加抢收抢插十二天，早上四点钟起床，刈、打、晒、挑、栽，干到晚上十一点钟，尚不觉累。其实并没有什么奇怪。公社化后第一个年头，早禾生长与去年大不相同了。我在中洲、柏树所刈的早禾，金黄的稻稿，一行挨一行，一株靠一株，秆粗、兜大、穗长。去年我也在这里收刈过，是收刈多兜化，刈二十多兜才有一把，今年七、八兜就有一把。我用的那把湖南镰刀，无法奈何这些兜大、秆粗的早禾。挑谷的感觉也不同了，今年谷压在肩上像挑一担石子，腰都直不起来，挑到晒谷坪上一称是一百七十到一百八十斤。非怪有些社员向我提出：“今年早禾特别好，刈不动，你也应与干部商量个什么办法。”是呀，是该想个办法，迅速开展高工效运动，从群众当中找出干劲和巧劲，不这样真会拖长季节。
    累，不仅是我一个人的感觉，所有参加收刈的人都觉得累。但丰收使我不禁发出微笑。丰收是人民公社无比的优越性带来的。从短裤头中，摸出一根已被汗浸透了的烟来抽，觉得有一番说不出的美味。
    七月八日
    柏树大队第五小队有个五十挂零、作田算把好手的社员熊沐金，接受新事物，脑子总不能很快转过来，可是丰收的事实摆在面前，他的思想也完全变了。我跟沐金共一个禾桶打禾，他有趣地对我说：“你在这里时间也不算短，从办互助组起，你和我们一起，春耘秋收，一直过了五个年头。哪块田，哪只坂，逐年产量你心中有本册。我呢？从只有桌子高就作田起，在解放十年中，收成一年好一年，可没碰过像今年这样大面积早禾丰收年成，今年算捉到一条大鲤鱼呀！”说到这里，他托着沉甸甸的谷穗，成串的金黄色的珍珠般的谷粒给我看，“这该有多重呢？”我问今年早禾能不能增产？他满有把握地说：“不要慌，交账有我。”晚上，他拉我到他家吃晚饭，特地为我准备了田螺肉，夏季的田螺滋味鲜美，在禾坪上借着月光吃晚饭，觉得别有风味。我们边吃边扯，天南地北扯了一大堆，但主题还是谈丰收。这一晚真使我分享了不少丰收的乐趣。
    七月十日
    昨晚天热，躺在床上老是睡不着，鸡叫头遍，我就爬起来，悄悄地走出柏树新村观赏夜景。月色早下山了，星星布满天空，一切景物隐约可见。我想今天我是最早起床的人。这时忽听对面南边大坂传来吆喝牛声，我抬头向那边望去，只见两个黑影在蠕动，走近一看，真是“莫道君行早，更有早行人”，原来是河下小队老社员傅登淮和张老四在犁田。我问他们怎么这样早，他们还故意跟我打趣：“上了年纪的人，瞌睡少，晚上睡不着，赖在床上翻来复去要磨破汗衫和簟子。”我也开玩笑地说：“是不是和老妈子生气，早点起床，换换新鲜空气？”
    傅登淮全家有十口人，老两口子，四个崽，两个女，一个媳妇，一个孙子，除他自己和大儿子、媳妇是劳动力外，其它都是老的老，小的小，只能吃，不能做。登淮老汉可是个勤快人，但负担太大，公社化前，一年忙到头，到年终还是落个缺粮户，解放前的日子更不用提。公社化后，他家经济状况来了个“扭转乾坤”，除吃饭外，每月还能领十元、八元零用钱。日子越过越红，干劲怎能会不越来越足呢？
    七月十一日
    繁星布满天空，半边月牙斜挂着，热气逐渐从地面消失，微微的南风迎脸吹来。劳动了一天的我，感到有些倦意。四边静悄悄地，我和凤山大队支部书记张洪俊来到河边，想洗个痛痛快快的冷水澡，我横着身子躺在浅水沙滩上，恍如睡在沙发床上一样柔软。清凉的河水从身上冲过，叫人感到非常舒适。他关心地问我：“您累吗？”我随口说：“有些累。”我接着问他：
  “你累不？”显然我这句话，问得有些多余，我知道他是个永远不知疲倦的人。借着月亮和星光，照得他那漆黑粗阔的背上闪闪发光。他回答说：“我不累。”他总是这样不知疲累，好像背后有股巨大力量在支持他。他的声音像洪钟一样，笑声爽朗。他的话匣子打开了，他冲走了我的倦意：“我当干部十年，也没看到从公社成立一天起，就像玩西洋镜似地，变化多快！社员生活已开始改善，今春大队开展多种经营，春熟作物丰收，再加上办社中节约成本，降低费用，仅仅是半年，全大队二百一十七户社员几乎家家户户都有余钱，若不是有信用部，钱都无处放呢。”
    我随口插上一句：“你家怎么样？”我晓得他家境不太好，六个人吃饭，全靠他一双手。”
    “我家也同样变了，往年进钱不多，今年仅半年光景，也分到五十七元。”说到这里，他为了使我更加相信凤山大队的变化，继续对我说：“别以老眼光看我们穷鬼凤山吧！过去有女不愿嫁，天晴三日受旱，天雨三日成灾，疙瘩命，穷鬼底子，收入一年只能维持一年。现在我们腰包硬了，底子实了，‘穷’字从脑壳上扯下来了！如今邻近的姑娘都跑到凤山来物色对象，可是我们的青年小伙子却高谈‘条件论’了，挑了又挑，选了又选，还要试试姑娘的真情实意。”接着他算着最近结婚的青年社员有项书珍、张洪春、张代富……一连串名字，几乎叫我记不住。他说得几乎忘记是在河里洗澡。我建议他洗完澡后，将竹床搬在一块睡再详细谈。
                （未完待续）
