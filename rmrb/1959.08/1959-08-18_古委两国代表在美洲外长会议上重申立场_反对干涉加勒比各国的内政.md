Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 16th: Due to differences of opinion arising during the discussion of various resolutions, it was formally announced here today that the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, originally scheduled to conclude on the 17th, would be extended to the 18th.

Reports indicate that the main disagreement centers on the issue of granting the Peace Committee of the Organization of American States the "power" to interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries. The working group's original proposal on the principle of non-intervention was supported by the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. However, Cuba held a different opinion. Cuba also opposed certain other draft resolutions submitted to the conference by the working groups. Cuba's position was supported by Venezuela.

The United States is exerting pressure on the conference from all sides in order to implement its will.

Today, the U.S. delegation held a secret meeting with representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and El Salvador, all members of the working group drafting resolutions on the issue of non-intervention. The U.S. Secretary of State personally attended the meeting, directing and deploying efforts.

Following this meeting, the Secretary-General of the conference, Luis Melo, announced to reporters that the foreign ministers had "reached an agreement" on authorizing the "Peace Committee" to "investigate" and "monitor" the situation in the Caribbean region. It is believed that the "Peace Committee" granted such "powers" is actually a replica of the Caribbean "Surveillance Committee" proposed by Herter.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter has already held behind-the-scenes talks with the foreign ministers of eleven countries. Last night, Herter invited Cuban Foreign Minister Roa to the U.S. Embassy for a forty-five-minute secret meeting. The content of the meeting was not disclosed.

It is worth noting that even before the U.S. proposal to grant the Peace Committee of the Organization of American States the "power" to interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries has been formally adopted by the conference, Haitian Foreign Minister Louis Mars has already threatened that his government will demand that the so-called Peace Committee "take action" against Cuba for "invading" Haiti. Although Mars also admitted that his government has not yet clarified the origins of the small group that supposedly "invaded" Haiti.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 16th: "Combate," the organ of the Cuban Revolutionary Directorate, published a commentary today entitled "Refuting Herter," stating that "U.S. Secretary of State Herter's speech at the (American) Foreign Ministers Conference is by no means a good omen for the people of this continent who are fighting for their rights."

"Combate" emphasized that developments indicate that "the purpose of this Foreign Ministers Conference is merely to try to prevent the development of the Cuban revolution, consolidate U.S. control over Latin America, and prevent revolutionary movements like Cuba's from developing in other countries."

### 古委两国代表在美洲外长会议上重申立场　反对干涉加勒比各国的内政

　　古委两国代表在美洲外长会议上重申立场
　　反对干涉加勒比各国的内政
    新华社圣地亚哥16日电　由于在讨论各项决议案过程中发生了意见分歧，今天这里正式宣布，原定在17日结束的美洲外长会议，延到18日闭幕。
    有消息说，分歧主要发生在赋予美洲国家组织所属和平委员会以干涉加勒比各国内政的“权力”这个问题上，研究互不干涉原则的工作小组原订的方案得到美国、巴西、墨西哥、哥伦比亚、秘鲁、厄瓜多尔、智利和阿根廷的支持。但是古巴持有不同的意见。古巴还反对各工作小组向大会提出的其他某一些草案。古巴的立场得到委内瑞拉的支持。
    美国为了贯彻它的意志，正在从各方面对会议施加压力。
    今天美国代表团和草拟不干涉原则问题的决议草案的工作小组成员阿根廷、巴西、哥伦比亚、智利、厄瓜多尔、墨西哥、秘鲁以及萨尔瓦多等国家代表举行了秘密会议。美国国务卿亲自出席了这次会议，进行指挥部署。
    在这次会议以后，大会秘书长路易斯·梅洛向记者宣布，外交部长们已经就授权“和平委员会”去
  “调查”和“监督”加勒比地区局势一点“达成协议”。人们认为，赋予这种“权力”的“和平委员会”，实际上是赫脱提出的加勒比海“监督委员会”的翻版。
    美国国务卿赫脱已经和十一个国家的外交部长举行了幕后会谈。昨天晚上，赫脱又邀古巴外交部长罗亚到美国大使馆去举行了四十五分钟的秘密会谈。会谈内容没有透露。
    值得注意的是：甚至在美国要求给予美洲国家组织和平委员会以干涉加勒比海各国内政的“权力”这一主张还没有被会议正式通过的时候，海地外交部长路易·马尔斯就已经扬言，他的政府将要求所谓和平委员会对古巴“入侵”海地一事“采取行动”。虽然马尔斯也承认，他的政府对所传“入侵”海地的一小撮人的来历都还没有弄清楚。
    据新华社哈瓦那16日电　古巴革命指导委员会机关报“战斗报”今天发表了一篇题为“驳赫脱”的评论说，“美国国务卿赫脱在（美洲）外长会议上的发言对本大陆为争取他们的权利而斗争的人民决不是什么好的征兆。”
      “战斗报”强调指出：事态的发展表明，“这次外长会议的目的仅仅是设法阻止古巴革命的发展，巩固美国对拉丁美洲的控制，防止像古巴那样的革命运动在其他国家发展。”
