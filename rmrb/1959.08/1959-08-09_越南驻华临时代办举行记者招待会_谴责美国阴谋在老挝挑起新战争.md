Xinhua News Agency, August 8th. Phạm Bình, Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, held a press conference in Beijing today, vehemently condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism in instigating the Lao Kingdom government to violate the Geneva Accords and preparing to provoke a new war in Laos, and refuting the shameless slanders made by U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently. At the conference, Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim Phạm Bình pointed out that the profound root cause and direct factor for the recent particularly serious situation in Laos is due to the interference of U.S. imperialism. He said that from the very beginning of the restoration of peace in Indochina, U.S. imperialism has intensified its efforts to undermine the Geneva Accords, consistently and actively interfering in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a U.S. military base and drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

Phạm Bình pointed out that the recent dangerous provocative actions of U.S. imperialism and the Lao Kingdom government have seriously threatened the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia. U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the current serious situation in Laos and the consequences caused by this situation.

Phạm Bình emphasized that the Lao Kingdom government's statement of July 28, 1959, and the U.S. State Department's statements of July 30 and August 1, shamelessly slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for disrespecting the Geneva Accords, which is completely a case of "the thief crying 'stop thief'." He said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always respected and maintained the Geneva Accords and the joint statement issued by the governments of Vietnam and Laos, and has put forward constructive suggestions to the Lao Kingdom for establishing friendly neighborly relations.

Phạm Bình pointed out that the blatant slander of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by U.S. imperialism and the Sananikone government is aimed at covering up their sinister plot to expand the civil war in Laos, turn Laos into a U.S. military base, drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Southeast Asia.

At today's reception, Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim Phạm Bình also read out and distributed to Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing the full text of the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 5 regarding the situation in Laos.

    谴责美国阴谋在老挝挑起新战争
    新华社8日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办范平今天在北京举行中外记者招待会，严厉谴责美帝国主义嗾使老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议和准备在老挝挑起新战争的罪行，驳斥美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府最近对越南民主共和国的无耻污蔑。范平临时代办在会上指出：老挝局势最近变得特别严重的深远根源和直接因素是由于美帝国主义的干涉。他说，从印度支那和平刚刚恢复的时候开始，美帝国主义就加紧破坏日内瓦协议，一贯地积极地对老挝进行干涉，企图把老挝变成美国的军事基地，并且把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团。
    范平指出，美帝国主义和老挝王国政府最近危险的挑战行动已经严重地威胁着越南民主共和国，威胁着印度支那和东南亚的和平。美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府必须对老挝当前的严重局势以及对这种局势所造成的后果负全部责任。
    范平强调说，老挝王国政府1959年7月28日的声明和美国国务院7月30日和8月1日的声明，竟然反诬越南民主共和国不尊重日内瓦协议，这完全是“贼喊捉贼”式的无耻污蔑。他说，越南民主共和国一贯尊重和维护日内瓦协议以及越南、老挝两国政府所共同发表的声明，并且对老挝王国提出了建立友好邻邦的建设性建议。
    范平指出，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府对越南民主共和国进行明目张胆的污蔑，其目的是在于掩盖他们扩大老挝内战、把老挝变成美国的军事基地和拉入东南亚侵略集团、威胁越南民主共和国的安全和东南亚和平的罪恶阴谋。
    在今天的招待会上，范平临时代办还向北京的中外记者宣读和散发了越南民主共和国外交部8月5日就老挝局势所发表的声明全文。
