Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 19th: All Hanoi's daily newspapers and periodicals have devoted considerable space to editorials, special articles, and pictures to commemorate the 14th anniversary of Vietnam's August Revolution today.

Many editorials call for further promoting the tradition of the August Revolution of 1945, strengthening national unity, continuously advancing under the leadership of the working-class party, and building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam.

"Nhan Dan" (People) prominently published an article on its front page by Le Duc Tho, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, entitled "The Party's Leadership - A Decisive Factor in the Victory of the Revolution."

The article said, "The victory of the August Revolution is inseparable from the leadership of the Party, which is the vanguard of the working class, the motivator and organizer of all the achievements of the Vietnamese people."

The editorial published by the theoretical magazine "Hoc Tap" (Study) of the Vietnam Workers' Party, pointed out the important role played by the national united front in the Vietnamese revolution. "Hoc Tap" pointed out that at present, while North Vietnam is advancing towards socialism, South Vietnam still has to struggle against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique to complete the people's national democratic revolutionary task. In this situation, closely uniting the people of the whole country within the national united front is even more important for building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong Vietnam, and for making a positive contribution to safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

"Hanoi Capital News" devoted considerable space to news about the general uprisings in Hanoi, Saigon, and other parts of Vietnam in 1945. This newspaper called on the people to carry forward the tradition of the August Revolution.

"Lao Dong" (Labor) weekly, the organ of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, called on workers and trade union organizations to celebrate this festival by developing production. An article in "Thoi Dai Moi" (New Era) emphasized the lessons of the August Revolution—national unity around the working-class party and within the scope of the national united front.

    河内报纸号召发扬八月革命传统
    加强团结争取越南和平统一
    新华社河内19日电　所有河内的日报和期刊都以巨大的篇幅刊载社论、专论和图片来纪念今天的越南八月革命十四周年。
    许多社论要求进一步发扬1945年8月革命的传统，加强民族团结，在工人阶级政党的领导下不断前进，建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣和强大的越南。
    “人民报”在头版以显著地位刊载越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎德寿写的一篇文章，题目是“党的领导——革命取得胜利的决定性因素”。
    文章说，“八月革命的胜利是同党的领导分不开的，党是工人阶级的先锋队、越南人民一切成就的鼓动者和组织者。”
    越南劳动党理论杂志“学习”杂志发表的社论，指出了民族统一战线在越南革命中所起的重要作用。“学习”杂志指出，在目前，当北越正在向着社会主义前进的时候，在南越却仍然不得不同美国—吴庭艳集团进行斗争以完成人民的民族民主革命任务。在这种情况下，把全国人民紧密地团结在民族统一战线之内，对于建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主、繁荣和强大的越南，对保卫东南亚和全世界的和平作出积极的贡献，是更为重要了。
    “河内首都报”以大量篇幅登载了关于1945年在河内、西贡和越南其它地方总起义的消息。这家报纸号召人民发扬八月革命的传统。
    越南总工会机关报“劳动”周刊号召工人和工会组织用发展生产来庆祝这个节日。“新时代报”的文章强调八月革命的教训——围绕工人阶级政党并在民族统一战线范围内的民族团结。（附图片）
