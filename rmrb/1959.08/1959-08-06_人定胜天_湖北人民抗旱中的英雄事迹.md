Man Will Conquer Nature
——Heroic Deeds of the People of Hubei in Fighting Drought

A struggle to wrest grain, cotton, and oil crops from the drought has been unfolding vigorously across Hubei Province. These days, despite the scorching sun, six to seven million laborers, under the leadership of the Party, are full of spirit and soaring enthusiasm. Everywhere are scenes of battles to conquer the drought, with people damming rivers, building embankments, digging wells, and pumping water to irrigate the fields:

            Overnight

It was dark when the anti-drought army of over 170 people from the Lishan Commune in Suixian County, composed of government cadres, enterprise employees, and school teachers and students, set out for the front line of the drought fight. Tonight's mission was to go to the reservoir construction site, which had been planned in advance, to heighten the dam. The anti-drought army arrived at the side of the dam, and Chang Dongchang, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, gave an order: "Comrades, let's get to work; it's time for us to show our abilities." With that, he and Zhao Zili, the county Party secretary, were the first to shoulder grass bags and walk onto the top of the dam. Immediately afterwards, everyone followed one after another onto the top of the dam, and an intense dam-building battle began.

The moon hung in the sky, half bright and half dim. Working was somewhat inconvenient compared to the daytime. The dam surface was very slippery, and several comrades lost their footing and fell into the water, their clothes soaking wet, but they got up and continued to scoop sand and carry sacks, without a word of complaint.

As the east gradually brightened, the weir was raised by two feet, and the river water was stored in the reservoir, which could expand the irrigation of 10,000 mu of fertile land.

        Conquering the Drought Demon in Seven Days

This was the seventh day since the drought fight began. Sun Hongzu, a member of the Daxing Production Team of the Changtan Commune in Zhongxiang County, was deeply moved to see that the eyes of branch secretary Tian Zhensheng were bloodshot from staying up all night, and he persuaded him, "Secretary Tian, you should rest for a while!" Old Tian smiled slightly and said, "I'm not tired. If the fields don't have water for a day, the seedlings will suffer from drought for a day. If the grain doesn't enter the granary, I can't rest well."

Seven days ago, Old Tian had conducted an inspection of all 1,665 mu of paddy fields in the team and found that 562 mu were suffering from drought. Old Tian knew that "grain fears drought in the womb." The mid-season rice was budding and earing at the time, and if this critical period wasn't handled well, yields would be reduced. Thinking of this, Old Tian couldn't calm down.

After Old Tian comprehensively arranged the team's double-cropping, field cultivation, and drought resistance work, he picked up his bedding and went to settle down in the sixth team, where the drought was most severe. After surveying the situation, he found that 120 mu of fields in this team were short of water. So he discussed with the team committee and experienced farmers to jointly survey and find water sources. As a result, they found that they could open a channel to divert water from the Dangzi River, which was three li away, and then use seven waterwheels to pump water over the mountain. After this method was decided, Old Tian worked day and night with everyone to pump water. After a week of hard work, the 120 mu of mid- and late-season rice fields suffering from drought in the sixth team were relieved of the drought disaster.

              In the Commune's Big Family

The first team of the Fengmiao Production Team of the Fushui Commune in Anlu County was close to the reservoir and had sufficient water sources. Even if it didn't rain for several months, the drought wouldn't threaten them. However, not long after the drought fight began, Zhu Guangyao, the captain of this team, was worried and anxious. What was he worried about?

In recent days, four teams in the Fengmiao Production Team had very few ponds and suffered from severe drought. When Zhu Guangyao saw this situation, he thought: Can we only care about ourselves and not care about others in the commune's big family? No, we can't. Therefore, at a meeting of the production team, Zhu Guangyao made a guarantee: We will definitely open up channels to allow water to flow smoothly to the fields of our brother teams.

The next day, Team Leader Zhu led more than 70 team members, with the assistance of the second team, and worked hard for three days to dig a new channel more than two li long. After releasing the water, Team Leader Zhu personally checked it again and found that the water flow was very slow because the channel was a little narrow in some places. So he led all the team members again and continued to work for two days and two nights to dig the channel to a width of three chi and six cun. As a result, large areas of rice fields in the four teams with severe drought were irrigated in time.

                  The Gong and Drum Sounded in the Middle of the Night

It was almost midnight. Xiong Yongjin, the branch secretary of the Qianjin Production Team in Yingshan County, heard the sound of water-pumping gongs and drums faintly ringing on the other side of the mountain on his way home after checking the water leakage in the fields. He turned around and headed towards the fourth team. He had told the members of the fourth team several times not to work the night shift, but they wouldn't listen. He was very annoyed. As he approached the waterwheel frame, he shouted from afar: "Old Cao, the moon is overhead, aren't you resting yet? Don't you want to implement the team's resolution!" Captain Cao Yuanfu, afraid of being criticized, nudged a team member next to him and slipped down from the waterwheel frame to hide behind a big tree. Quick-mouthed Xiao Chen responded, "Captain Cao is already asleep." "Why aren't you sleeping?" Several team members replied at the same time: "We slept and then got up again." Several old team members standing under the waterwheel frame, holding Secretary Xiong with one hand and touching the drought-stricken green rice ears with the other, said: "We can't sleep if we don't save the grain that's about to be harvested!" Under the moonlight, Secretary Xiong looked at the high-spirited team members and the drought-stricken green rice that seemed to be asking for help, and didn't know what to do for a moment. After a moment of silence, he said as if announcing an important decision: "Okay! I will work with you to pump enough water into this field before going to sleep." With that, he jumped onto the waterwheel frame, and the drum head began to turn. At this time, Captain Cao came out from behind the tree unhurriedly and said, "Secretary Xiong, it's not that I'm not implementing the team's resolution!" Secretary Xiong smiled, but at this time the sound of gongs and drums, mixed with the rapid turning of the waterwheel, had resounded throughout the night sky.

    人定胜天
    ——湖北人民抗旱中的英雄事迹
    一场与干旱争夺粮食、棉花和油料的斗争，已经在湖北全省如火如荼地开展起来了。这些日子，尽管赤日炎炎，但是，六七百万劳动大军在党的领导下，精神焕发，干劲冲天，到处是拦河筑坝、挖泉找水、车水灌田的征服干旱的战斗景象：
            一夜之间
    天黑了，随县厉山公社由机关干部、企业职工和学校师生一百七十多人组成的抗旱大军，开上了抗旱前线。今晚的任务是开往事先计划好了的水库工地，加高堤坝。抗旱大军来到大坝旁边，公社党委第一书记常东昌一声令下：“同志们，干吧，是我们显本事的时候了。”说罢便和县委书记赵子理第一个扛起草包走上坝顶，紧接着，大家一个跟着一个上了坝顶，一场紧张的筑坝战斗开始了。
    月亮半明不明的挂在天上。干起活来，比起白天来，多少有些不大方便。坝面很滑，有好几个同志失脚掉下水里，衣服浸得透湿，爬起来还是忙着撮沙、扛麻包，没有一个叫累。
    东方渐渐发白，滚水坝加高了两尺，河水被拦蓄在库里，可以扩大灌溉一万亩良田。
        七天降服旱魔
    这是抗旱开始的第七天。钟祥县长滩公社大兴生产队的社员孙洪祖看到支部书记田振生的眼圈都熬得通红，心里非常感动，就劝着说：“田书记，你该休息一下呀！”老田微微笑了一下说：“我不累，田里一天没有水，秧苗一天受旱，谷子不进仓，是不能很好休息的。”
    七天以前，老田对全队的一千六百六十五亩水稻田，作了一次检查排队，发现受旱田五百六十二亩。老田知道：“谷怕胎里旱”，眼前中稻正在含苞抽穗，要是这个火口抓不好，就要减产，想到这里，老田的心情怎么也安静不下来。
    老田在全面安排了队的双抢、田间培育、抗旱等工作之后，就打起了被包，来到旱象最严重的六小队落户。经过摸底，这个队有一百二十亩田缺水。于是他同队委、老农们商量，共同勘测找水源，结果发现可以把三里路开外的垱子河水开渠道引水，再用七部水车，翻水过山。这个办法决定后，老田便白天黑夜和大家一起车水，经过一个星期的苦战，六小队受旱的一百二十亩中晚稻解除了旱灾。
              在公社大家庭里
    安陆县洑水公社冯庙生产队一小队紧靠水库，水源充足，即使几个月不下雨，干旱也威胁不了他们。但是，抗旱开始不久，这个小队的队长朱光耀却心事重重，非常焦急。他到底为了什么呢？
    这几天，冯庙生产队有四个小队由于塘堰很少，旱情十分严重。朱光耀见到这种情况，心想：在公社大家庭中，能只顾自己，不顾别人吗？不，不能。于是，在一次生产队召开的会议上，朱光耀作了保证：我们一定开通渠道，让水畅快地流到兄弟小队的畈里去。
    第二天，朱队长就带着七十多个社员在二小队的协助下，大战了三天，挖成了一条二里多长的新渠道。放水后，朱队长又亲自检查了一遍，发现水流很慢，原因是渠道有些地方窄了一点。于是他又带着全队社员，继续干了两天两夜，把渠道全部挖到三尺六寸宽。这样一来，四个旱情严重的小队的大片大片的稻田，及时地灌上了水。
                  夜半锣鼓响
    快半夜了。应山县前进生产队的支部书记熊永金检查完田里漏水情况以后，在回家的路上隐约地听到山那边车水锣鼓仍在咚咚的响，便折身朝四小队走去。四小队的社员加夜班，他已经说过几回了，就是不听，他心里很恼火。快走到车水架，他就老远喊了起来：“老曹呀，月亮当顶了，你们还不休息，队的决议就不想执行啦！”队长曹远福怕挨批评，碰了旁边一个社员一下，从车架上溜下来躲到大树后面去了。快嘴小陈随声应道：“曹队长早睡啦。”“你们怎么不睡呢？”几个社员同时回答：“我们睡了又起来的。”站在车水架下的几个老社员，一手扯着熊书记，一手摸着含苞欲吐的稻禾说：“眼看到手的谷不救，我们睡不着呵！”熊书记在月光底下，看看斗志昂扬的社员，看看垂头求救似的受旱的青禾，一时不知怎么好，沉默了一会儿，像宣布一项重要决定似的说：“好！我同你们把这块田的水车足了再睡觉。”说罢，他一下跳上了车架，车鼓头就转动起来。这时，曹队长不慌不忙从树后面走出来，说：“熊书记，这不是我不执行队里的决议呵！”熊书记笑了，但这时的锣鼓声夹着水车飞快的转动声，已经响彻夜空。
