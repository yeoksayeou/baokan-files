Xinhua News Agency, 11th - A medical university with an eight-year program, China Medical University, has been established in the capital and is currently handling enrollment and preparations for the start of the semester.

The task of this school is to cultivate medical science and technology talents with socialist consciousness who can master a relatively high level of modern scientific foundations and modern medical science.

The school's academic system is set at eight years, with three years of basic science studies (at Peking University), two years of basic medicine, two years of clinical medicine, and one year of internship. The teaching of basic science courses and foreign languages has higher requirements than general higher medical colleges. During the three years of basic science studies, students will learn chemistry, physics, biology, and other courses, including the latest world achievements in these disciplines. Throughout the entire teaching program, students are required to learn both English and Russian.

In order to cultivate students' ability to think and work independently, in addition to carefully improving teaching quality and strengthening internships when studying basic medicine and clinical medicine courses, students will also be organized to participate in research groups under the guidance of teachers to conduct certain scientific research activities from the fourth year onwards. Throughout the entire teaching process, political education will also be strengthened, and a certain amount of time will be arranged for participation in productive labor, so as to cultivate students into well-rounded talents who are both red and expert.

In order to train the required cadres more quickly, in addition to enrolling freshmen for the first year, this semester will also enroll transfer students for the fourth year, who will begin studying basic medicine courses after entering the school.

China Medical University was established by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on the basis of the original Peking Union Medical College. Most of the relevant senior researchers from the ten research institutes and five specialized and comprehensive clinical hospitals affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences will participate in the school's teaching work.

    新华社11日讯　一座八年制的医科大学——中国医科大学已经在首都成立，现在正在办理招生和开学准备事宜。
    这个学校的任务是培养具有社会主义觉悟的，能掌握较高的现代科学基础和现代医学科学水平的医学科学技术人才。
    这所大学的学制定为八年，基础科学学习三年（在北京大学），基础医学二年，临床医学二年，实习一年。基础科学课程和外国语的教学都比一般高等医学院校有较高的要求。学生们在三年的基础科学的学习期间，将学习化学、物理学、生物学等课程，其中包括这些学科的现代世界新成就。在整个教学计划中，要求学生学会英文、俄文两种外国语文。
    为培养学生的独立思考和独立工作的能力，除在学习基础医学和临床医学课程时认真提高教学质量和加强实习以外，并从四年级起组织学生在教师指导下参加研究小组进行一定的科学研究活动。在整个教学过程中还将加强政治教育，并安排一定的时间参加生产劳动，培养学生成为又红又专、全面发展的人才。
    为了更快地培养出所需要的干部，这个学期除招一年级新生外，还招收四年级插班生，他们进入学校后就开始学习基础医学课程。
    中国医科大学是由中国医学科学院在原中国协和医学院的基础上筹建的。中国医学科学院所属的十个研究所和五个专科性和综合性的临床医院的有关高级研究人员，多数将参加该校的教学工作。
