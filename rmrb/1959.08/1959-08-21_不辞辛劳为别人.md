    Tirelessly Serving Others
    In Xian County, Hebei Province, you often encounter a young man when you enter Dinan Commune. He has a large backpack slung across his shoulder and rides a green bicycle, speeding along the road leading to the villages. People in this area can recognize him from afar as Old Zhang, the mail carrier from the commune's postal and telecommunications office.
    Old Zhang's name is Zhang Jingzhe. He is responsible for delivering over 670 copies of newspapers and periodicals to twenty-two villages in the commune's three management districts, traveling more than 80 li every day. To ensure that the daily newspapers quickly reach subscribers, he proposed the slogan: "Sort as soon as they arrive, never delay newspapers and periodicals for a minute,不怕严寒和酷热，顶风冒雨保证送" (not afraid of severe cold or scorching heat, delivering them against wind and rain). Especially when the newspapers publish major national events, even if it is in the middle of the night, he must deliver them to subscribers.
    In addition to doing his job well, Old Zhang also takes the initiative to help everyone. He often assists the commune and management districts in transmitting notices and delivering documents. If commune members have matters and don't have time to leave the village, he helps them with errands. When Wang Ruzhang, a member of Fuxing Village, had a death in his family, and everyone was busy preparing for the funeral with no one to get cloth purchase certificates, he heard about it and immediately jumped on his bicycle and rushed to the Dinan Village supply and marketing cooperative. By the time the procedures were completed, it was already noon. Without even eating, he got back on his bicycle and braved the hot sun to deliver it to the commune member's home, a round trip of more than 40 li.
    In the past six months, he has ensured the timely completion of his duties, helping the commune, management districts, offices, and schools transmit notices and documents more than 200 times, and going to the grain station to exchange grain coupons more than 70 times, and to the hospital to pick up medicine more than 50 times. His spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly has been praised by the vast majority of commune members. (Ma Lianqing) (Attached picture)

    不辞辛劳为别人
    在河北省献县，当你进到堤南公社，经常会碰见一个青年人，肩上斜挎着大背包，骑着一辆绿色自行车，在通向村庄的大道上急驰。这个地区的人们远远一望就能认出那是公社邮电局的投递员老张。
    老张，名叫张敬哲，他负担着这个公社三个管理区二十二个村六百七十多份报刊的投递工作，每天要跑八十多里路。为了使每天的报纸很快地和订户见面，他提出“何时来到何时整，报刊不停一分钟，不怕严寒和酷热，顶风冒雨保证送”的口号。特别是每当报纸上发表了国家的重大事情时，即使是半夜来到，他也要送到订户手里。
    老张除了做好自己职责内的工作，他还主动帮大家办事。他经常协助公社，管理区，传递通知捎文件。社员有事情。没时间出村，他就帮助代办。复兴村社员王如章家死了人，家里人都忙着筹备丧事，没人去开购布证，他听说了，马上骑上自行车，一溜烟跑到堤南村供销部。当手续办完后已经晌午了。他连饭也没吃又蹬起车子顶着炎热的太阳送到社员家，往返四十多里。
    半年来，他保证按时完成了本职业务，帮助公社、管理区、机关、学校来往传递通知文件二百多次，到粮站换粮票七十多次，到医院取药五十多次。他这种全心全意为人民服务的精神，受到广大社员们的赞扬。（马连庆）（附图片）
