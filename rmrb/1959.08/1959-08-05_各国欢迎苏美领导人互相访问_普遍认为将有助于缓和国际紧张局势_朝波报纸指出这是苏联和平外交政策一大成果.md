Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The news of Khrushchev and Eisenhower's mutual visits in September and autumn of this year between the Soviet Union and the United States has been met with attention and welcome from officials, the public, and newspapers in many countries around the world.

Socialist Countries
　　The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary saying that the mutual visits of the Soviet and American leaders will be an event of great significance for easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of peace. This visit is a significant result of the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a peaceful foreign policy, the purpose of which is the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and the resolution of international disputes through negotiations.
　　"Rodong Sinmun" pointed out that today, when the "position of strength" policy pursued by the imperialist aggressive bloc has gone bankrupt, the United States has to take the path of negotiation. The balance of power between Eastern and Western countries has undergone fundamental changes. The time has come for the "position of strength" policy to disappear completely from the stage of history.
　　The Polish "People's Tribune" published a commentary saying that the Soviet Union and the United States are now the two most powerful countries in the world. Today, everyone is clear that the rapprochement and better mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States can create prospects for mankind without the threat of military conflict. The commentary pointed out that the Soviet government and Khrushchev himself have repeatedly advocated strengthening direct contact with American government officials and holding talks between the heads of government of the two countries. The United States has long opposed this. However, today's experience shows that reason has prevailed.
　　The Czechoslovak "Red Right Daily" published a commentary pointing out that the upcoming mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States have aroused a wide range of good reactions around the world. The newspaper pointed out that this visit will be of great benefit to improving relations between the East and the West. "People's Defense Daily" wrote: Khrushchev's invitation to visit the United States and Eisenhower's invitation to visit the Soviet Union are particularly important events in the entire fourteen years of the post-war period.
Asian Countries
　　Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hasono announced on the evening of the 3rd that President Sukarno was pleased that the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States could meet and discuss issues related to what are considered the root causes of world tension between the two countries. President Sukarno said that the Indonesian people hope that the two leaders will resolve the current stalemate, although this stalemate can only be resolved gradually.
　　All newspapers in Ceylon published the news that Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and US President Eisenhower were about to visit each other. The title added by the "Ceylon Times" when publishing this news was: "Welcome mutual visits. Hope that tensions will ease after Eisenhower and Khrushchev visit each other."
　　The Information and Culture Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 4th, pointing out that the mutual official visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States are prominent events on the post-war political stage. Although it is impossible to expect this mutual visit to immediately lead to the easing of international tensions due to the current complex international situation, the statement emphasized that it can be expected to find ways to eliminate the crises on the current international stage.

Western European Countries
　　The announcement that Khrushchev and Eisenhower were going to visit each other was welcomed by British Prime Minister Macmillan. Macmillan said in a statement issued on the 3rd: "I welcome the announcement that President Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev will visit each other." He also said: "I have always believed that tensions between East and West can be resolved to a great extent through personal contact and conversation. This contact and conversation plays a role as important as more formal meetings."
　　Macmillan said: "I am very happy that the US President believes that it is right to invite the Soviet leader to visit the United States and have personal talks with him. I feel that my talks with Mr. Khrushchev at the beginning of this year were extremely beneficial, and I am sure that when the highest-level meeting is held, these visits will lead to a fruitful and constructive meeting of heads of government."
　　The British public believes that the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower are events of great significance for easing international tensions.
　　British newspapers of all tendencies warmly welcomed the news about the mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States, and believed that arranging Soviet-American relations is of great significance for resolving international disputes.
　　The "Daily Mirror," with the largest circulation, pointed out in an editorial that it is undoubtedly the best news in a long time that the heads of the two major powers have finally decided to visit each other. "This is the news that the whole world has been waiting for since 1946. Only the highest-level Soviet-American talks can achieve peace. This kind of meeting can help to convene the highest-level meeting and eliminate the worst consequences of the Cold War."
　　The Labor Party newspaper "Daily Herald" wrote in an editorial: "Big news! Best news!" The newspaper believes that Khrushchev and Eisenhower's mutual visits are "necessary steps" to "save the world from the Cold War and the dangers of the Cold War."
　　The Conservative Party newspaper "Daily Express" pointed out that personal contact between heads of government is the "right path." The newspaper wrote that the news of Khrushchev and Eisenhower's mutual visits is "significant news" that should "make all sensible people in all countries happy."
　　The British labor people's newspaper "Worker's Daily" wrote that the mutual visits of the Soviet and American leaders are a blow to the "most vicious Cold War advocates." The newspaper wrote that the outcome of mutual visits depends on the people. The newspaper called on all sectors of society to launch a campaign to achieve disarmament and a ban on nuclear weapons agreements.
　　People from all walks of life in France expressed their approval and satisfaction with the news of the upcoming mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States. All newspapers attach great importance to this event, reporting and commenting on the news on the front page with large headlines.
　　"Le Figaro" published a full page of reports from Moscow, Washington, Geneva and other cities, and published the full text of the Soviet-American communique.
　　"L'Humanité" welcomes the upcoming mutual visits, considering it an event of paramount importance. The newspaper wrote that it is the first time that the head of the Soviet government has visited the United States, and there is no need to emphasize the importance of this event any further. This matter was unimaginable a few years ago.
　　"L'Humanité" also pointed out that French officials have a cold attitude towards this news, which has been approved by the whole world, and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refused to comment on the mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States.
　　Italian Prime Minister Segni said on the 3rd: "All initiatives and contacts that help to clarify the relationship between East and West and help bring new hope for a real easing of tensions will be endorsed by the Italian government."
　　The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued an official communique saying: The Italian government "welcomes the meeting of the two heads of government" because this meeting will promote the convening of the highest-level meeting.

    普遍认为将有助于缓和国际紧张局势
    朝波报纸指出这是苏联和平外交政策一大成果
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：苏联和美国发表的赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔在今年9月和秋后互相访问的消息，受到了世界许多国家官方、公众和报刊的重视和欢迎。
    社会主义国家
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表评论说，苏联和美国领导人的相互访问将是对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平事业具有重大意义的事件。这种访问是苏联一贯执行的和平外交政策的显著结果，这一政策的目的是为了不同社会制度国家的和平共处和用谈判方式解决国际争端。
      “劳动新闻”指出，今天，当帝国主义侵略集团所奉行的“实力地位”政策陷入破产的时候，美国不得不走谈判的道路。东西方国家之间的力量对比发生了根本的变化。“实力地位”政策应该彻底从历史舞台上消失的时候已经到了。
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表评论说，苏联和美国是现在世界上两个最强大的国家。今天大家都清楚，苏、美两国的接近和更好的相互了解，能够为人类创造出没有军事冲突的威胁的前景。评论指出，苏联政府和赫鲁晓夫本人最近一再主张加强同美国政府人士的直接接触，主张两国政府首脑之间举行会谈。美国长期以来一直反对这样做。但是，今天的经验表明，理智获得了胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”发表评论指出，苏美两国政府首脑即将相互访问一事，引起了全世界广泛的良好反应。报纸指出，这种访问将对改善东西方的关系有很大好处。“人民防线报”写道：赫鲁晓夫应邀访美和艾森豪威尔应邀访苏，是战后时期整整十四年来特别重要的事件。
    亚洲国家
    印度尼西亚外交部发言人哈索诺3日晚上宣布，苏加诺总统对苏联和美国两国的领导人可以会见并讨论有关两国的被认为是世界紧张局势的根源的问题这件事表示高兴。苏加诺总统说，印度尼西亚人民希望两国领袖们将解决目前的僵局，尽管这种僵局只能逐步地加以解决。
    锡兰各报都刊登了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔即将相互进行访问的消息。“锡兰时报”在刊登这条消息时所加的标题是：“欢迎相互访问。希望在艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫相互访问后紧张局势得以缓和。”
    日本外务省情报文化局4日发表声明指出，苏联和美国政府首脑之间相互进行正式访问，是战后政治舞台上突出的事件。尽管由于目前复杂的国际局势，还不可能指望这次相互访问能够立即导致国际紧张局势的缓和，但是声明中强调指出，可以期望找到消除目前国际舞台上的危机的途径。
    西欧国家
    赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔将要互相访问的公告，受到英国首相麦克米伦的欢迎。麦克米伦在3日发表的一项声明中说：“我欢迎艾森豪威尔总统和赫鲁晓夫先生将互相访问的公告。”他还说：“我一向认为，东西方之间的紧张局势可以通过个人的接触和交谈而在很大的程度上得到解决。这种接触和交谈起着和较正式的会议一样重要的作用。”
    麦克米伦说：“我很高兴美国总统认为邀请苏联领袖访问美国并同他进行个人会谈是正确的。我觉得今年年初我同赫鲁晓夫先生的交谈是极其有益的，我确信，当最高级会议举行的时候，这些访问将会导致一个政府首脑的有成果的和建设性的会议。”
    英国公众认为赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将相互访问一事是对缓和国际紧张局势具有十分重大意义的事件。
    英国各种倾向的报纸热烈欢迎有关苏美两国政府首脑相互访问的消息，并认为安排好苏美关系对解决国际争端具有重大的意义。
    发行量最大的“每日镜报”在社论中指出，两大国的首脑终于决定相互访问，这无疑是长期以来最好的消息。“这是全世界从1946年以来就一直盼望着的消息。只有苏美最高级会谈才能实现和平。这种会谈能够有助于召开最高级会议并消除冷战最坏的后果。”
    工党报纸“每日先驱报”在社论中写道：“重大的消息！最好的消息！”这家报纸认为，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔相互访问是“把世界从冷战和冷战危险中拯救出来”的“必要步骤”。
    保守党报纸“每日快报”指出，政府首脑的私人接触是“正确的途径”。报纸写道，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔相互访问的消息是应该“使各国一切有理智的人们高兴”的“意义重大的新闻”。
    英国劳动人民的报纸“工人日报”写道，苏美两国领导人的相互访问是对“最凶恶的冷战鼓吹者”的打击。报纸写道，但是，相互访问的结果取决于人民。报纸呼吁社会各界展开一个争取达成裁军和禁止核武器协议的运动。
    法国社会各界人士对苏联和美国政府首脑即将相互访问的消息表示赞同和满意。所有报纸都十分重视这一事件，以大标题在头版上报道和评论这个消息。
    “费加罗报”以整版篇幅刊登了来自莫斯科、华盛顿、日内瓦和其他城市的报道，并全文刊载了苏—美公报。
    “人道报”欢迎即将进行的相互访问，认为这是具有头等重要意义的事件。报纸写道，苏联政府首脑访问美国还是第一次，没有必要再强调这一事件的重要性，这件事在几年以前是不可想像的。
    “人道报”同时指出，法国官方人士对这个得到全世界赞同的消息态度冷淡，法国外交部对苏美政府首脑相互访问一事拒绝作任何评论。
    意大利总理塞尼3日说：“凡是有助于澄清东西方之间的关系，有助于为紧张局势的真正缓和带来新希望的一切倡议和接触都将得到意大利政府的赞同”。
    意大利外交部还发布一项正式公报说：意大利政府“欢迎两位政府首脑的会见”，因为这种会见将促使最高级会议的召开。
