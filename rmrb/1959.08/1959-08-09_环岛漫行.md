Wandering Around the Island
By Our Correspondent, Du Daozheng

From Guangzhou to Haikou City at the northern tip of Hainan Island is about 1300 li. We took a civil aviation flight and arrived in two and a half hours. When the weather is normal, there are daily civil aviation flights between Guangzhou and Haikou. By bus and ship, it takes only two days.

Haikou is the capital of Hainan Island. The roads are lined with Taiwan acacia, red bayberry and other trees, and there are many cafes. Although it is located in southern China, the climate is relatively cool. Comrades here say that even in August, when it is at its hottest, it only lasts for a while during the day. In the evening, when the sea breeze blows, you still need a quilt to sleep.

Because we could not speak Hainanese, the Hainan Daily specially sent Comrade Wu Zhi to accompany us on our trip around the island. Comrade Wu Zhi was a company commander in the old Qiongya Column and was very familiar with the local area. Along the way, he told us many stories about the struggles during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Reminiscing about the past made us love this place even more deeply.

Boundless Virgin Land

The next morning, we set off by car. Starting from the east, we drove along the newly built ring road. The car flashed past the academy described in the Cantonese opera "Searching the Academy," and left the urban area of Haikou. The roadsides were full of dense shrub forests. Looking at these undeveloped virgin lands, Lao Wu sighed: Hainan Island has a total of 29 million mu of arable land, of which only 7 million mu are currently cultivated. How many resources are waiting for us to develop!

The car continued south at high speed, successively entering Qiongdong, Lehui, Wanning and other counties with dense populations and fields stretching as far as the eye could see. Large patches of rice paddies, lemongrass fields, sisal fields, and pineapple fields were next to each other. We stopped the car and asked some children in the fields to pick some lemongrass for us. When we rubbed the leaves, a fragrant smell penetrated our lungs. When we threw away the rubbed grass residue, the fragrance on our hands lingered for a long time. Lemongrass is a tropical crop used to make high-grade spices. A mu of land can yield hundreds of jin of lemongrass oil a year. A jin of lemongrass oil costs 5.5 yuan, and a mu of land can generate several thousand yuan in income. Hainan Island has planted hundreds of thousands of mu of lemongrass this year.

Hometown of Tropical Crops

The hometown of tropical crops—the famous Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm—is located in a basin southwest of Wanning County. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, with the southeastern peaks blocking the sea and typhoons. The Diaoluo Mountains to the west are a forest area rich in precious timber, and the clear and quiet Sun River meanders through the center of the basin. Along the roadsides, the mountains and fields are covered with sisal, lemongrass, oil palm, coffee, and cocoa.

We visited demonstration coffee fields and pepper fields. Last year, the average yield of ordinary coffee fields was 70 jin per mu, but one demonstration field yielded 275 jin per mu. The pepper in the experimental field was two people tall, and the pearl-like fruits were so heavy that they were about to break the branches.

In the evening, Farm Director Zhan Lizhi briefed us on the situation of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm. This old farm director was the old Chief of General Affairs of the Qiongya Column Headquarters. He said that the farm now has more than 5,800 returned overseas Chinese, and it has become a large town. Before liberation, Xinglong was a desolate and desolate place where epidemics were prevalent. There were more than 20 kinds of poisonous mosquitoes. People who were bitten often died of black diarrhea. Before liberation, there was a saying in Hainan: "Wanning Lingshui, there is no return," which referred to the Xinglong area. In the early days of liberation, there were less than 1,000 people in this area, who lived by planting 1,200 mu of rice fields and running small businesses. The state began to support the reclamation of wasteland by returned overseas Chinese in 1951. Unexpectedly, in just a few years, they have built such a large enterprise. The cultivated land area is now 120,000 mu, and it is planned to reclaim tens of thousands of mu more this year.

Xinglong Town, where people were almost extinct at the time of liberation, has now become a modern small city. There are electric lights, telephones, dozens of rows of newly built brick houses, factories, middle schools, and roads crisscrossing each other with vehicles coming and going. The next morning, we visited the farm's lemongrass oil factory, saw China's first red-skinned cocoa tree, and embarked on our journey again.

Ideal Salt Fields

The next destination was the Yingge Salt Field. Xinglong and Yingge are two parallel corners on the southern side of Hainan Island. Going west, the car passed Yazhou (now Yaxian, where the seat of Yaxian County is located in Sanya), where Su Dongpo was exiled, and the cape where Su Dongpo inscribed the words "Tianya" (End of the Earth). The trees gradually thinned out. Approaching the Yingge Salt Field, the white beaches were smoking, and there was less grass. The railway from Yulin Port to Yingge Salt Field, which is being laid, is built on this dry and hot beach.

First, we saw the iron railway lines in the salt field, which stretched out of sight, and rows of neat channels. The salt drying fields were also flat and well-arranged, and on the land a few miles away, red flags were planted, people were crowded, and machines roared, and construction was underway. Passing through hundreds of rows of thatched houses, we arrived at the headquarters of the Yingge Salt Field. The headquarters was located in a small store, with two rooms. The upstairs was divided into several small rooms with cardboard to receive experts, and the downstairs was used for office work. The Yingge Salt Field is famous for its frugality in construction.

The director of the salt field was a demobilized military officer. He unfolded a blueprint and told us: The Yingge Salt Field is one of the major modern salt fields newly built in our country, with more than 10,000 employees and a planned annual output of 700,000 tons. It can be completed this year. He said that this salt field has advantages that all other salt fields in the country do not have. It has high concentration, high evaporation, little rain, and flat terrain. In other sea salt fields in the country, the best is to collect two jin of salt from 100 jin of seawater, but here it can collect three and a half jin. When drying salt, the greater the evaporation, the shorter the salt formation time and the more salt collected. The terrain here is flat. The difference in height in the 3,800 hectares of salt fields is less than two meters, which facilitates the inflow and outflow of seawater. He also said that the salt field will build a chemical plant to produce salt by-products. There are 50 kinds of these by-products, which can extract valuable medicines. At that time, salt will become a by-product instead of the main product.

High-Grade Datie Mountain

To go to the Shilu Iron Mine, which enjoys a renowned grade, you have to go north along the west coast to the newly built Basuo Commercial Port, and then turn east. The road from Yingge to Basuo Commercial Port is a narrow, flat grassland. In the mountains to the east, there are primitive forests that cannot be crossed in a few days and nights, including valuable timber such as nanmu. There is a tree called huanghuali, which is said to last for hundreds of years even when buried in the ground. These trees are as high as 15 zhang and as thick as several people can embrace. Thousands of people are now logging there. There is a newly built railway from Basuo Commercial Port to Shilu. The road and railway run parallel, and the roadsides are again full of dense ocean-like shrub forests. Dozens of miles away from Shilu, we saw rows of fire flashing on the top of a big mountain. Then, there was a dense explosion. There are 15,000 workers here, and each shift has thousands of people. When they go to and from work, they crowd the newly opened roads.

In the morning, we climbed to the top of the mine. Because of the complete mechanization, the top of the mountain was not lively. The green ore that had been cracked and peeled off was being shoveled up by huge excavators and put into train carriages, and then poured down the hundred-zhang-high cliff-like chute into the ore crusher like a flood. Below the ore crusher was the railway track, and the trains, emitting plumes of black smoke, transported the crushed ore to Basuo Commercial Port, and then transferred it to Anshan Iron and Steel and other places.

The secretary of the Shilu Mine Party Committee, who accompanied us on the mountain, said that the average iron content of the Shilu Iron Mine ore is 55%, and the best is 68%. Steel mills all over the country are vying for the ore here, and the mine's production is always unable to keep up. The production plan has been increased again and again. We asked about the reserves of this mine. He gestured and said that the mountain is all iron from the top to the foot, several miles high and several miles thick. The proven reserves are 300 million tons. The Shilu Mine was completed and put into production last year on "July 1st". Now, even a small mountaintop has not been flattened. At the current scale of mining, it will not be exhausted in a hundred years!

We also visited the nearby copper mine. According to the Party Committee Secretary and Lao Wu, Hainan Island's underground resources are also extremely diverse and rich. There is said to be oil on the seabed of Yingge, and the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm has 40 kinds of minerals such as gold, copper, and crystal underground.

Institutions of Higher Learning for Studying Tropical Plants

On the way back to Haikou from the Shilu Iron Mine, we passed through Nada County.

In a place called Puzai, we visited the new site of the research institute in China specializing in the study of tropical plants and the Hainan Branch of the South China Agricultural College, which specializes in cultivating tropical crop talents.

There are three very informative exhibition rooms here. The materials in the exhibition room show that almost all tropical crops are treasures all over the body, without any waste. Such as coconut trees, sisal, lemongrass, oil palm, coffee, etc. The research and experimental materials also prove that Hainan Island's natural conditions are capable of planting all tropical crops and can grow them well. For example, tropical crops need heat the most, and they are also most afraid of cold. However, the temperature in southern Hainan Island is above 20 degrees Celsius throughout the year, and the temperature in the north is also between 18 and 20 degrees Celsius.

We traveled 1,200 li around the island. It is a pity that we did not see the heart of Hainan Island—Mount Wuzhi. I heard that there are more treasures there. But even so, we are already satisfied. Because we have already seen the richness of Hainan Island and all its beauty, and we have seen all the charm that attracts thousands of pioneers.

    环岛漫行
    本报记者　杜导正
    从广州到海南岛北端的海口市约一千三百里，我们乘民航机去，两个半钟点就到了。气候正常的时候，广州同海口天天有民航机对开。乘汽车、轮船，也只有两天的路程。
    海口是海南岛的首府。马路两旁满种着台湾相思树、红映树等树木，开设着许多咖啡馆。这儿虽然位于祖国南部，但气候比较凉爽。这儿的同志说，就是八月份热到顶点的时候，也只是白天一阵子。晚上海风一吹，睡觉仍然要盖被子。
    因为我们不会说海南话，海南日报专门派了吴之同志陪伴我们作环岛旅行。吴之同志是老琼崖纵队的连长，地方非常熟，一路上给我们讲了很多抗日战争和解放战争时期的斗争事迹。缅怀过去，使我们更加深深地爱上了这个地方。
    无边无际的处女地
    第二天清早，我们乘车出发了。从东边开始，沿着新建的环岛公路开去。车子闪过粤剧“搜书院”中所描写的那座书院，就离开了海口市区。公路两旁尽是茂密的灌木林。望着这些未开垦的处女地，老吴感叹地说：海南岛一共有可耕地二千九百万亩，现在种植的仅仅七百万亩。多少资源等待着我们去开发呵！
    车子继续以高速度南下，相继进入人烟稠密、田连阡陌的琼东、乐会、万宁等县。一大块一大块的稻田、香茅草田、剑麻田和菠萝田挨在一起。我们停下车，请田间小朋友摘几支香茅草给我们，把叶子揉烂，一股香味道沁人肺腑，丢掉揉烂的草渣子，手上的香味还久久不散。香茅草是一种制造高级香料的热带作物，一亩田一年收的叶子可炼几百斤香茅油。一斤香茅油五元五角，一亩田可以收入几千元。海南岛今年种了几十万亩香茅草。
    热带作物的家乡
    热带作物的家乡——著名的兴隆华侨农场，就在万宁县西南的盆地内。四面群山环抱，东南的山峰挡住大海和台风，西边的吊罗山是盛产贵重木材的林区，清澈而安静的太阳河从盆地中央蜿蜒流过。公路两旁，满山遍野的剑麻、香茅、油棕、咖啡和可可。
    我们参观了示范咖啡田、胡椒田。去年普通咖啡田，一亩平均收获七十斤，有一亩示范田却收了二百七十五斤。试验田里的胡椒，每株有二人高，像珍珠串样的果实，重得快将枝子压断了。
    晚上，场长詹力之同志给我们介绍了兴隆华侨农场的情况。这位老场长是琼崖纵队司令部的老总务科长，他说，这农场现在一共有五千八百多名归侨，这里已经是一个很大的市镇了。解放前，兴隆地界是个疫疠流行的荒凉冷落的地方，毒蚊有二十几种，人被咬以后，往往疴黑屎病死。解放前海南流行一句话：“万宁陵水，有去无回”，就是指兴隆地方说的。解放初期，这一带不到一千人，靠种一千二百亩稻田，兼营小本买卖为生。国家从1951年开始扶持归侨垦荒，想不到短短几年，就闹下这么大的家业。现在已开垦的土地有十二万亩，今年打算再开几万亩。
    解放时人烟几乎绝迹的兴隆镇现在俨然变成一座现代化的小城了。电灯电话，几十排几十排新起的砖房、工厂、中学，公路纵横交错，车辆往来不绝。次日清晨，我们参观了农场的香茅油制造厂，看了我国第一株红皮可可树，又踏上了旅途。
    理想的盐田
    下一个目标是莺歌盐场。兴隆和莺歌是海南岛南面平行的两个角。一路西去，车过苏东坡当年被放逐的崖州（即崖县，今崖县县治设三亚）和苏东坡题着“天涯”二字的海角时，树木渐渐稀疏起来。快到莺歌盐场的时候，白色的沙滩冒着烟，草都少了。正在铺轨的榆林港到莺歌盐场的铁路，就建在这干燥炎热的沙滩上。
    先看到盐场中望不见头的一股股铁道线，一排排整齐的渠道。晒盐的场子，一格一格地也平整妥贴了，几里外插着红旗的土地上，人山人海，机器轰鸣，正在施工。穿过百多排茅草房，我们到了莺歌盐场场部。场部住的是以前的一家小商店，有两间房大，楼上用纸板隔成几个小房间，招待专家，楼下办公。莺歌盐场建场的俭省是出名的。
    场长是个转业军官。他展开一幅蓝图，对我们说：莺歌盐田是我国新建的几大现代盐田之一，职工一万多，计划年产量七十万吨。今年可以完工。他说这盐场有国内所有其它盐场不及的地方。它浓度高，蒸发量大，雨少，地势平。国内别的海盐场，一百斤海水收盐二斤就是最好的了，这里能收到三斤半。晒盐的时候，蒸发量越大，成盐时间越短，收盐越多。这里地势平，三千八百公顷的盐场，高低相差不到两公尺，便利海水进退。他还讲，盐场要建一座化工厂，生产盐的副产品。这副产品有五十种，能提炼贵重的药品，到那时候，盐倒从主产品变成副产品了。
    品位很高的大铁山
    到品位享有盛名的石碌铁矿去，要沿西海岸北上，到新建成的八所商港，再往东方折去。莺歌到八所商港是一块狭长的平坦的草原，东边的大山里，有几天几夜走不尽的原始森林，其中有楠木等名贵木材，有一种叫花梨木的树，据说这种树埋入土中几百年也不朽。这树有高到十五丈、粗到几个人抱不拢的，现在已有几千人在那里采伐。八所商港到石碌有新建的铁路。公路和铁路并行，两旁又尽是茂密的海洋似的灌木林。离石碌几十里，就看见一座大山顶上一排排的火光在闪烁。接着，传来了密密的爆炸声。这里有一万五千工人，一班就是几千人，上下工的时候，把几条新辟的马路挤得满满的。
    早晨，我们登上了矿山的顶峰。由于全部机械化的缘故，山顶上倒不热闹。崩裂脱落下来的青色矿石，正被巨大的掘土机铲起，放到火车厢里，顺着百丈高的悬崖般的滑道槽，像洪水一样泻入碎矿机。碎矿机下就是火车道，冒着团团黑烟的火车，把碎好的矿石一列列运往八所商港，再转运到鞍钢等地去。
    陪我们登山的石碌矿党委书记说，石碌铁矿矿石平均含铁量55％，最好的68％。各地钢厂争着要这里的矿石，矿山生产总是跟不上，生产计划一再加码。我们问这座矿山的蕴藏量，他比划着说，这山从山顶到山脚，几里高几里厚统通是铁，已查明的蕴藏量是三亿吨。石碌矿是去年“七一”建成投入生产的，现在连个小小的山顶也没有削平，用现在的规模开采，一百年也采不完呢！
    我们还参观了附近的铜矿。据这位党委书记和老吴说，海南岛的地下资源也是极多样、丰富的，莺歌海底据说有石油，兴隆华侨农场地下就有金、铜、水晶等四十种矿产。
    研究热带植物的高等学府
    从石碌铁矿回海口路经那大县。
    在一个叫铺仔的地方，参观了我国专门研究热带植物的研究所和专门培养热带作物人才的华南农学院海南分院新址。
    这里有三个内容十分丰富的陈列室。陈列室的材料说明，所有热带作物几乎浑身是宝，没有一点废物。如椰子树、剑麻、香茅、油棕、咖啡等等。研究和实验的材料还证明：海南岛的自然条件，是可以种植一切热带作物并能够种好的。如热带作物最需要热，也最怕冷。但是海南岛南部终年温度在二十度以上，北部也在十八度到二十度之间。
    我们绕岛旅行了一千二百里，遗憾的是没有看到海南岛的心脏——五指山，听说那儿财宝更多。但就是这样，我们也已经心满意足。因为我们已经看到海南岛的富饶和她的全部的美丽，看到了她吸引着千万个开拓者的全部魅力。
