Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: The picking and purchasing of summer tea is nearing its end, and autumn tea is about to enter the market. Tea-producing areas are busy arranging the autumn tea picking work, and commercial departments are also stepping up preparations for purchasing autumn tea.

Some tea-producing areas have established special organizations for tea production and purchasing, headed by the secretaries of the prefectural and county party committees, to strengthen leadership. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce have dispatched a large number of cadres, along with faculty and students from Zhejiang Agricultural College, a total of about 600 people, to go deep into the tea areas to assist in strengthening tea production and purchasing. Commercial departments in Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have helped people's communes build more than 1,300 new mechanical tea processing stations, which will greatly improve tea processing efficiency. Commercial departments in various tea-producing areas are currently increasing the number of purchasing points and will send people to the production teams and tea processing stations to conduct mobile purchases.

As of the end of July, 61.77% of this year's tea purchase plan has been completed. During the peak season of spring and summer tea picking, all localities paid special attention to the fine processing of Sichuan Mengding tea, Guizhou Duyun Maojian tea, Jiangxi Wuyuan Mingfeng tea, and other famous teas. Many areas also organized forces to pick wild tea, pick and produce border-selling tea, and advocated saving self-retained tea, trying to sell good tea to the state as much as possible.

    各地准备收购秋茶
    全年茶叶收购计划已完成61％
    据新华社20日讯　夏茶的采摘、收购工作将近结束，秋茶即将上市。各产茶区正忙于布置秋茶采摘工作，商业部门也在加紧准备收购秋茶。
    有的产茶地区由地委、县委书记挂帅，成立了茶叶生产、收购的专门机构，加强领导。浙江农业厅和商业厅已抽出大批干部，和浙江农学院师生一起，共约六百人，深入茶区协助加强茶叶的生产和收购。福建、江西、湖北、浙江、安徽五省商业部门，帮助人民公社新建了一千三百多个机械制茶所，将大大提高制茶效率。各产茶区的商业部门目前正在增加收购点，并且将派人深入到生产队和制茶所去流动收购。
    今年的茶叶收购计划，到7月底止，已完成61.77％。在春夏采茶旺季中，各地特别注意精制四川蒙顶茶、贵州都匀毛尖茶、江西婺源茗峰茶等各种名茶。许多地区还组织力量采摘了荒野茶，采制边销茶，并提倡节约自留茶，尽量将好茶出售给国家。
