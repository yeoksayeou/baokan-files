Horticultural Undertakings Flourish

　　(Our newspaper, Urumqi, August 8th) Xinjiang, known as the "Home of Fruits," has seen great development in its fruit tree horticulture this year. According to incomplete statistics, the region has cultivated over 167,000 mu of various fruit trees such as peaches, apricots, pears, apples, grapes, walnuts, and pomegranates this spring, nearly doubling the total for the entire year of last year. At the same time, various localities have cultivated more than 8,700 mu of fruit seedlings.

    Currently, people's communes and horticultural farms throughout Xinjiang are further planning land, organizing irrigation channels, and planning to plant another 200,000 mu of fruit trees this autumn.

    There are two distinct characteristics of Xinjiang's development of fruit tree horticulture this year. One is that after the people's communes were established, fruit forests and nurseries are being developed on a large scale; the other is that all special districts and counties along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are attaching importance to fruit tree production. Areas along the railway within the autonomous region, such as Hami, Turpan, Changji, Manas, Jinghe, Tacheng, and Yili, have adopted the method of simultaneous planning, construction, and production, and have established seven state-owned horticultural farms.

    The area planted with fruit trees in Xinjiang has reached 500,000 mu by last year, with a total of twenty fruit types and more than three hundred varieties, producing more than 400 million jin of various fresh fruits annually. Among them, Korla's fragrant pears, Yili's apples, Kashgar's cherries, Yecheng's pomegranates, and Turpan Basin's seedless white grapes are all first-class quality fruits in our country.

　　园艺事业欣欣向荣
    本报乌鲁木齐8日电　号称“瓜果之乡”的新疆，今年果树园艺事业有很大的发展。据不完全的统计，全疆春季已栽培桃、杏、梨、苹果、葡萄、胡桃、石榴等各种果树十六万七千多亩，比去年全年增加将近一倍；同时，各地还培育了果苗八千七百多亩。
    目前全疆各人民公社和园艺场正在进一步规划土地，整理渠道，计划在今年秋季，再种植果树二十万亩。
    新疆今年发展果树园艺事业中有两个显明的特点。一个特点是人民公社化后，大面积发展果林和苗圃；另一个特点是兰新铁路沿线各专区、县，都重视果树的生产。自治区铁路沿线的哈密、吐鲁番、昌吉、玛纳斯、精河、塔城、伊犁等地，采用边规划、边建场、边生产的办法，建立了七个国营园艺场。
    新疆历年来种植的果树面积到去年已达五十万亩，共有二十个果树种类，三百多个品种，年产各种鲜果四亿多斤。其中库尔勒的香梨、伊犁的苹果、喀什的樱桃、叶城的石榴、吐鲁番盆地的无核白葡萄，都是我国果类中的第一流佳品。
