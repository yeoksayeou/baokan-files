    The Thousand-Mile Horse is Galloping…
    Zheng Xiangru
    In the spring of 1956, when the azaleas were in bloom, I visited some villages and cities in Korea. My memories are interwoven with scenes of vibrant peaceful construction and the heavy wounds of war. The newly built thatched-roof houses in the new villages emerge in my mind, the freshly laid thatch glistening, the light yellow and orange colors of the tiles, all as vivid as if I were still there. They stood erect in the war-torn mountains and fields, appearing so solemn, powerful, and beautiful! But the unfinished ruins and rubble, the bullet holes, the forests stripped of their bodies and scorched, the farmland shattered and carved into deep pits... these impressions are equally difficult to forget. Korean farmers meticulously fed and bred livestock, replanting the land, and the villages and fields were full of life. Some agricultural cooperatives even used tractors and harvesters; however, due to the excessive damage to livestock during the war, the difficult scene of people pulling wooden plows in the fields was not uncommon.
    In the heroic city of Pyongyang, hailed as the "Immortal Bird," I stayed in a comfortable and elegant hotel, strolling along the magnificent and beautiful Stalin Avenue. The shade of the trees and the fragrance of the flowers filled me with the happiness of peace. The wonderful performances at the Moranbong Theater brought joy. I visited the home of a construction worker in the Ordinary Gate Street workers' residential area. Their room was spacious, well-lit, with good air quality, clean, and tastefully decorated. I couldn't help but admire it. The owner told me that during the war, they lived in air-raid shelters, dark and damp, which took the life of his only little daughter, and his wife had been ill ever since.
    "The war brought disaster to many families, but it's nothing. We finally made it through. Now we have a warm home. We must hurry up with construction and lay a solid foundation for socialism. With a solid foundation, no matter how evil the enemy is, they won't be able to defeat us."
    His words were right. His words, along with the ceaseless roar of machines, the sounds of clearing ruins, building roads, and constructing houses, remained in my heart.
    While recalling these things, I also remembered the enemy's viciousness and their already exploded lies. They妄想 to erase the city of Pyongyang from the map, turning it into a dead city. Pyongyang proved to the world that it was a giant, a hero. Although it suffered terrible disasters, the enemy spared no expense in pouring countless tons of steel upon it. The streets and houses were bombed to smithereens, the original streets were unrecognizable, and it was almost impossible to find a complete house. But Pyongyang lived, it did not die. At that time, residents, factories, institutions, schools... all went underground to fight. The famous Moranbong Theater was bombed into a pile of rubble by the enemy, but it did not stop performing. It built a wartime theater underground, at a depth of ninety meters on a slope and forty-seven meters vertically, at Moranbong.
    To compare these fragmented and chaotic memories with today's Korea, which is flying forward with the momentum of the Thousand-Mile Horse, is naturally too outdated. But this memory helps me to understand today's Korea more profoundly.
    At the "Thousand-Mile Horse" Exhibition in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I was both attracted and moved by the numbers that demonstrated brilliant achievements, and I was reluctant to easily pass by some interesting pictures. Many of the materials on display showed the heroic Thousand-Mile Horse soaring and galloping.
    Are these the cities from my memory? How can I recognize their old appearance now? They are so majestic, so charming. What used to be a wilderness overgrown with weeds is now a wide street lined with tall buildings; what used to be ruins radiating war and death is now a bustling factory. They are more beautiful and better than before the war. Pyongyang, which we are familiar with, has been rebuilt on a preliminary scale in the short days after the war, and now people are decorating it even more grandly and beautifully with fervent labor. University students spent sixty days repairing a sightseeing route along the Taedong River; in what used to be the weed-infested wilderness of East Pyongyang during the war, a beautiful Youth Street has been newly built; students from the Construction University spent three months building a new youth park at the foot of Moranbong Mountain. In the past, few people came here, but now it is full of tourists, with lush green grass. The West Pyongyang Central Square, built with the help of students from Kim Il-sung University, was named Mao Zedong Square by the citizens of Pyongyang. What is most surprising is the speed at which Pyongyang is building houses. According to statistics, an apartment for laborers is assembled on average every sixteen minutes.
    Miracles are appearing in the rural areas that suffered serious damage from the war. People pulling wooden plows has become a part of Korean farming history. Currently, the sound of tractor engines echoes across the fields, and rice planters and combine harvesters appear on plateaus at an altitude of 1,000 meters to harvest wheat. In forestry, mass tree planting movements are launched every year, and the transportation of materials in logging yards has been mechanized. Airplanes are spraying medicine to control hairy caterpillars. The heroic Korean people are not only advancing toward the mechanization of agriculture, but also proposing a bold goal: to fully complete the nation's electrification by next year. Currently, electrified railways have been laid from Sinch'ŏn to Yangdŏk. Korea is a famous country of scenic mountains and clear waters, rich in water resources, with many rivers and springs. Utilizing hydroelectric power has ample natural conditions, and they are expanding hydropower stations. The enthusiasm of the masses is overwhelming. Taking the expansion of the Shuifeng Hydropower Station dam as an example, the project was completed one year and four months ahead of schedule.
    Although the exhibition is not very large, the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary will overflowing in the many exhibits infects and inspires every visitor. The "Thousand-Mile Horse" is advancing bravely and resolutely! The soaring enthusiasm of the heroic Korean people is a good example for us to learn from!

    千里马在奔驰……
    郑襄汝
    1956年春天，金达莱花开放的时候，我曾访问过朝鲜的一些村庄和几个城市。记忆里交织着生气勃勃的和平建设景象和战争的惨重创伤。一个个新建农村的茅屋瓦舍浮现出来，那新复的茅草润泽，那淡黄、橘红的瓦舍色彩，都历历如在眼前。它们挺立在战火烧过的山野里、平原上，显得那么庄严有力，那么美丽！但那还来不及全部整治就绪的颓垣断瓦、弹坑枪眼，被削去了身躯和烧焦了的树林，被炸成一个个深坑而割碎了的耕地，……这些印象也同样难于忘记。朝鲜农民经心喂养、繁殖着牲畜，翻种着土地，村庄里、田野上生气活跃，有的农业合作社甚至用上了拖拉机和收割机；但由于牲畜在战争里损伤过多，在田间也不时看到人拉木犁的艰难情景。
    在那被人们誉为“不死之鸟”的英雄城——平壤，我住在一所舒适、讲究的旅社里，散步在雄伟、美丽的斯大林大街上，林荫和花香让人感到和平的幸福。牡丹峰剧场的精彩演出，使人喜悦。我曾到普通门大街工人住宅区一个建筑工人家里去作客，他们的房间宽敞，光线明亮，空气好，室内清洁，布置雅致。我赞赏不已。主人告诉我，他们战时住在防空洞里，阴暗和潮湿，夺去了他唯一的小女儿的生命，他的妻子也由此身体常病。
    “战争给许多家庭带来灾难，这算不了什么，我们总算熬过来了。现在我们有了温暖的家。我们得赶快建设，给社会主义打实基础。根基实了，敌人再恶也打我们不倒。”
    他的话是对的。他的话和那昼夜不停息的机器轰鸣声、清除废墟修筑马路、建造房屋的嘈声音，一起留在我心里。
    想起这些的同时，也记起了敌人的毒辣和他们早已吹破了的牛皮。他们妄想把平壤这个城市从地图上取消，把它变成一座死城。平壤向世界证明，它是巨人，它是英雄。虽然它遭受的灾难是惨重的，敌人曾不惜血本向它倾倒了无数吨钢铁，街道、房屋被炸得稀烂，原来的街道认不出了，也几乎找不到一所完整的房屋，但平壤活着，没有死。当时，居民、工厂、机关、学校……，都转入地下作战。那著名的牡丹峰剧场曾被敌人炸为一堆瓦砾，但它没有停止演出，它在斜深度九十米，垂直四十七米的牡丹峰地下，又建起了一座战时剧场。
    拿这些零零碎碎的杂乱回忆来和以千里马之势向前飞奔的今日朝鲜作比，自然是太陈旧了。但这回忆却帮助我较深刻地理解今日的朝鲜。
    在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“千里马”展览会上，我既为那表明辉煌成就的数字所吸引、感动，也不愿轻易从一些有趣的图片前面走过。许多展出的材料，都显示着英雄的千里马腾空奔驰的雄姿。
    这些是我记忆里的城市吗？如今，从哪儿去辨认它们旧日的容貌呢？它们是那么雄伟，那么妩媚。过去是杂草丛生的荒野，如今是楼房耸立、马路宽阔的大街；过去是发散着战争、死亡气息的废墟，如今是热气腾腾的工厂。它们比战前更美、更好。我们所熟悉的平壤，在战后的短短日子里，已初具规模地重建起来，现在人们又以火热的劳动，把它打扮得更雄壮，更美丽。大学生们，以六十天的时间，修好了一条大同江岸的游览路；战时，杂草丛生的东平壤荒野上，新建了一条漂亮的青年大街；建设大学的学生们，以三个月时间在牡丹峰山麓新建了一个青年公园。过去，这里行人罕至，现在游人如织，绿草如茵。金日成综合大学的学生帮助修建的西平壤中心广场，平壤市民把它命名为毛泽东广场。最使人惊奇的是平壤建造住宅的速度，据统计平均每十六分钟装配好一套劳动者的住宅。
    在遭受战争破坏严重的农村，正出现着奇迹。人拉木犁，已成为朝鲜耕作的历史。目前，拖拉机的马达声响彻田野，插秧机、联合收割机出现在海拔一千米的高原上收割麦子。在林业方面，每年展开群众性的植树造林运动，伐木场上运送材料机械化了，飞机在撒药治毛虫。英雄的朝鲜人民不但向农村机械化进军，而且还提出了豪迈的目标：明年全面完成国家电气化。目前，从新成川到阳德，已铺设电气化铁路。朝鲜是著名的山明水秀之邦，水源丰富，江河泉流多，利用水力发电，有充足的自然条件，他们正在扩建水电站。群众的干劲是十足的，以水丰水电站的堰堤扩建为例，工程提前一年零四个月完成了。
    展览会虽然不算很大，但洋溢在那许多展品的革命精神和革命意志，感染、鼓舞了每一个观众。“千里马”正在勇往直前地奔驰！英雄的朝鲜人民的冲天干劲，是我们学习的好榜样！
