    River Water Continuously Flows into Drought-Stricken Fields in Henan: Henan's Water Conservancy Projects Play a Significant Role
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 1st: The various water conservancy projects built in Henan Province since liberation have played a significant role in the current fight against drought. As of July 27th, the province has irrigated over 30 million mu of drought-stricken farmland by relying on these projects. Now, the water sources provided by these projects are continuously flowing into the fields through millions of crisscrossing canals throughout the province.
    The people of Henan, who historically suffered from the water and drought disasters of the Yellow River and Huai River, tasted the pain of family ruin and displacement. However, since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, and relying on state funding and support, the people of Henan have built many water conservancy projects for eliminating harm and promoting benefits on the Yellow River and Huai River's main and tributary streams. These projects have begun to change the situation of water and drought threats, not only increasing grain production year by year, but also effectively combating the severe drought, which is rare in the last seventeen years, as soon as it appeared in early July this year. The Yellow River water, which used to harm the people, now flows into the farmland that urgently needs irrigation through the various culverts and siphons of the Yellow River diversion canals; the large reservoirs such as Baisha, Boshan, Banqiao, and Shiman Tan in the upper reaches of the Huai River, as well as more than 5,000 medium and small reservoirs throughout the province, have also successively opened their gates to release water for irrigation. More than one million pits, ponds, and wells throughout the province have also played a role in the fight against drought.
    The People's Victory Canal, the Yuan(yang)-Yan(jin)-Feng(qiu) Irrigation Canal, the Wu(zhi)-(Huo)Jia Irrigation Canal, and the Qu Village Irrigation Canal, which run through the Xinxiang area, have irrigated more than two million mu of land since July 18th. Here, cotton farmers are busy controlling pests and applying fertilizer in the irrigated cotton fields, striving for more and larger cotton bolls.
    People's communes in various canal and reservoir irrigation areas are strengthening canal management and improving irrigation efficiency in order to give full play to the effectiveness of existing water conservancy projects.

    河水源源流入受旱秋田  
    河南水利工程发挥巨大作用
    据新华社郑州1日电　河南省解放以来修建的各种水利工程，在当前抗旱斗争中发挥了巨大作用。到7月27日止，全省依靠这些工程已经灌溉受旱秋田三千多万亩。现在，这些工程提供的水源，正在通过全省纵横交错的千百万条渠道，源源不断地流向田间。
    历史上受尽了黄河淮河水旱灾害的河南人民，备尝过家破人亡、流离失所的痛苦。但是，解放以来，河南人民在共产党领导下，依靠国家拨款与支援在黄河、淮河干、支流兴修了许多除害兴利的水利工程，开始改变了水旱威胁的情况，不但粮食逐年增产，而且当十七年来少有的严重干旱，在今年7月初刚一露头时，就受到了有力的抗击。过去为害人民的黄水，今天通过引黄灌渠的各个涵闸、虹吸管，流入急待灌溉的农田；淮河上游的白沙、薄山、板桥、石漫滩等大型水库以及全省各地的五千多座中小型水库，也相继启闸，放水浇田。全省一百多万个坑、塘、井泉在抗旱中也发挥了作用。
    贯穿新乡专区的人民胜利渠，原（阳）延（津）封（丘）灌溉渠、武（陟）（获）嘉灌溉渠、蘧村灌溉渠等引黄灌溉渠，自7月18日以来，已经浇地二百多万亩。这里的棉农正在浇过的棉田里忙着治虫、追肥，力争多座桃，座大桃。
    各个渠、库灌区的人民公社，为了充分发挥现有水利工程的效力，正在加强渠道管理，提高浇水效率。
