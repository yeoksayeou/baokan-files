　　Guangzhou, August 10 (Report from this newspaper) – The Zhonghe Production Brigade of Xinzhou Commune in Dan County, Hainan Island, which has historically been a low-yield area, under the strong leadership of the Party branch, achieved a special bumper harvest in all early rice unit area yields, more than doubling last year’s yield, a feat never before seen locally.
　　The Zhonghe Brigade is located on the coast of northwestern Hainan Island, at the site of the ancient city of Danzhou. This is where the famous Chinese writer Su Dongpo was exiled by the emperor, and the ruins of the Dongpo Academy where he lectured are still preserved today. Since the beginning of summer this year, people have come to visit from all over the county and from other places, in an endless stream. Today, people come here not only to visit the poet's historical sites, but more importantly to learn from the Zhonghe Brigade's experience in achieving a bumper harvest of early rice.
　　The Zhonghe Brigade has a total of one thousand mu of early rice, of which eight hundred mu have recently been harvested, with an average yield per mu more than double that of last year, and the total output has also greatly increased. Now every household is filled with joy, unanimously thanking the leadership of the Communist Party, and unanimously demanding to sell more surplus grain to support national construction. The Zhonghe Brigade's annual grain procurement task is a total of 220,000 jin, and it has already completed 180,000 jin, and has decided to sell another 70,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. This brigade will become a red banner for completing the annual grain procurement task ahead of schedule by half a year throughout Hainan Island.
　　Ancient Danzhou is located by the sea, with beaches everywhere, and is often threatened by drought. Before liberation, the people always relied on the heavens for food, and could only plant one crop a year, with low and unstable yields. For example, the more than 300 mu of "Dongpo Field" in front of the Dongpo Academy would be flooded when it rained and dry when it didn't, with 90 mu abandoned due to waterlogging. After liberation, the threat of drought was initially relieved here. In 1958, the brigade dug two large canals across the brigade's fields, drawing water from Tianjiao Pond to irrigate farmland. Later, it successively dug eleven small ditches, forming a drainage and irrigation network, enabling more than 2,000 mu of the brigade's more than 3,000 mu of paddy fields and dryland slopes to be freed from the threat of drought, and began to change from a single crop to a double crop. When planting early rice this year, it dug another 600-meter-long and 2-meter-wide ditch, enabling 300 mu of "Dongpo Field" to achieve self-flowing irrigation, and for the first time planted rice in the more than 90 mu known as "Dongpo Pond" after draining the waterlogging.
　　The Party Branch of the Communist Party of the Zhonghe Brigade played a strong leadership role in the technological reform of early rice, both earnestly listening to the opinions of the masses and boldly leading the masses forward. When preparing for spring planting, the masses were mobilized to discuss, and the commune members unanimously advocated that early rice should be planted as much as possible while striving for high yields. As a result, the area of early rice was no less than last year, and together with the middle crop, it increased by more than 300 mu, enabling the total output and unit yield to leap forward together. The brigade promoted advanced technology both actively and in accordance with local conditions. For example, the commune originally required each team to complete the batch of early rice seedlings within three days before the Spring Festival. At that time, cadres and the masses had different opinions. Some advocated implementing the commune's decision unchanged, while others advocated raising seedlings in five or six batches. The branch concentrated on studying various opinions and believed that the opinion of raising seedlings in three batches was both advanced and suitable for objective conditions. Raising seedlings five or six times would inevitably delay the season; while completing the batch was not suitable for the team's situation, because labor would be strained during transplanting, which would lead to poor cultivation, insufficient base fertilizer, transplanting old and weak seedlings, and poor transplanting. After the Zhonghe Brigade asked the commune for instructions, it implemented three batches of seedling raising, and as a result, transplanting was completed one month earlier than last year, and the quality was good. In addition, such as implementing reasonable close planting, grasping field management, eliminating three types of rice, and opening ditches in "Dongpo Field," attention was paid to listening to the opinions of the masses and promoting the enthusiasm of the masses. In particular, field management was well grasped. In the early stage of transplanting, large areas of three types of rice appeared, and the seedlings were generally yellow and could not grow. The old farmers believed that this was affected by the "north wind" and said that as soon as the "south wind" arrived, they would immediately turn green. At this time, under the guidance of the Commune Party Committee, the Party Branch immediately organized a large-scale field inspection and evaluation combining cadres, technicians, and the masses, implemented field consultation, grasped good and bad typical examples, and conducted free and frank discussions. As a result, the cause of the disease was found to be lack of fertilizer; the branch immediately organized a professional team to engage in large-scale fertilizer infrastructure construction, digging 209 dung pits in the fields within three days, building three toilets for every 20 households, and each production team set up a household fertilizer purchasing station and processing team, and rationally applied various fertilizers according to the different growth conditions of the seedlings, and the seedlings quickly turned green and tillered. More than 170,000 seedlings were originally transplanted per mu, and after tillering, some reached as many as 300,000 seedlings. In the later stage of early rice growth, reasonable drainage and irrigation were combined to prevent lodging. Throughout the entire field management process, cadres have been stationed in the fields and worked hard and skillfully with the masses. After one struggle after another, the victory of the early rice harvest was finally achieved.
　　The Zhonghe Brigade is now absorbing the experience of this year's early crop, and is doing everything possible to expand the planting area of late rice and improve the quality of cultivation. (Attached picture)

### 昔日东坡流放地　今日早稻大丰收  中和大队总产单产齐跃进  干部作风好，群众干劲高，产量成倍增，誉满海南岛

    昔日东坡流放地　今日早稻大丰收
    中和大队总产单产齐跃进
    干部作风好，群众干劲高，产量成倍增，誉满海南岛
    本报广州10日电　历来低产的海南岛儋县新洲公社中和生产大队在党支部的坚强领导下，全部早稻单位面积产量比去年翻一番，取得了当地从来没有过的特大丰收。
    中和大队地处海南岛西北部海边的古儋州故城所在地。这里是我国著名文学家苏东坡被皇帝放逐的地方，现在还留有他讲学的东坡书院古迹。今年入夏以来，从县内县外各地来参观访问的人，络绎不绝。人们今天来这里不仅是参观诗人的古迹，更重要的是向取得早稻特大丰收的中和大队学习丰产经验。
    中和大队早稻共一千亩，最近已经收刈了八百亩，平均亩产量比去年增加一倍多，总产量也大大增加。现在家家户户喜气洋洋，异口同声感谢共产党的领导，一致要求多卖余粮支援国家建设。中和大队全年征购粮任务共二十二万斤，目前已经完成十八万斤，并且决定再卖七万斤余粮给国家。这个大队将成为全海南岛半年超额完成全年征购粮任务的红旗。
    古儋州濒临大海，到处是沙滩，经常受干旱威胁。解放以前，人民向来靠天吃饭，每年只能播种一造，产量低而不稳定。例如东坡书院面前的三百多亩“东坡田”，遇雨即涝，无雨即旱，有九十亩积涝荒废。解放后，这里才初步解除了旱患的威胁。1958年，这个大队挖了两条横贯全队田野的大渠，引天角潭水灌溉农田。后来又陆续挖了十一条小沟，构成了一个排灌水网，使全队三千多亩水旱田坡地有二千多亩解除了旱灾的威胁，开始改单造为双造。今年种早造时，又挖了一条六百米长、二米宽的水沟，使三百亩“东坡田”实现了自流灌溉，而且把九十多亩被称为“东坡塘”的地方的积涝排干，第一次种上了水稻。
    中共中和大队党支部在早造技术改革工作中，发挥了坚强的领导作用，既认真倾听群众意见，又大胆领导群众前进。春天备耕时，发动群众讨论，社员一致主张早造要在争取高产的同时尽可能多种。结果，早稻面积不少于去年，连中造一起，共增加了三百多亩，使总产单产一同跃进。这个大队推广先进技术既积极又能因地制宜。例如公社原来要求各队在春节前三天内一批育完早稻秧。当时干部群众意见纷纷，有人主张一成不变地执行公社的决定，有人主张分五、六批育秧。支部集中研究了各种意见，认为分三批育秧的意见既先进又适合主客观条件。分五、六次育秧，必然耽误季节；而一批育完对这个队的情况也不适合，因为插秧时劳力紧张，就会产生耕作粗糙、基肥不足、插老秧、弱秧以及插管两不好等恶果。中和大队向公社请示后，便实行三批育秧，结果比去年提前了一月插完秧，而且质量良好。此外，如实行合理密植，抓紧田间管理、消灭三类禾，开“东坡田”水沟，都注意倾听群众意见，发扬了群众的干劲。特别是田间管理，抓得很好。插秧初期出现成片的三类禾，禾苗普遍发黄，长不起来。老农认为这是受“北风”的影响，说“南风”一到，立即返青。这时，党支部在公社党委的指导下，立即组织干部、技术员、群众三结合的田间大检查大评比，实行田头会诊，抓住好坏典型，进行鸣放辩论。结果，找出病源是缺肥；支部立即组织专业队伍，大搞肥料基本建设，三天内便挖田头粪坑二百零九个，每二十户建厕所三间，每个生产队设有家肥收购站和加工队伍，根据禾苗生长的不同情况合理追施了各种肥料，禾苗迅速返青、分蘖。每亩原插十七万多条苗，分蘖以后有的多达三十多万条苗。在早稻生长后期，又结合合理排灌，防止了倒伏。在整个田间管理过程中干部一直扎寨田头和群众一起猛干苦干巧干。经过一场一场的奋斗，终于取得了早稻丰收的胜利。
    中和大队现在正吸收今年早造的经验，千方百计扩大晚稻播种面积，提高耕作质量。（附图片）
