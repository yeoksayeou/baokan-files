    Thoughts Inspired by This Year's Bumper Wheat Harvest
    Xie Pingze
    While celebrating this year's large-scale bumper wheat harvest, people are summarizing the experiences of the harvest from various aspects. This year's wheat harvest once again proves that if people's thoughts and actions conform to objective laws, the results will be satisfactory; conversely, if people's thoughts and actions violate objective laws, the results will not be pleasant.
            Comprehensive vs. Central
    In Zicheng Commune, Zibo City, Shandong Province, two production brigades, Huangjiapu and Jacun, have historically seen Jacun's wheat yield per mu exceed that of Huangjiapu. This year, however, things changed, with Huangjiapu significantly surpassing Jacun: Huangjiapu's more than 2,700 mu of wheat achieved an average yield per mu that doubled last year's, while Jacun's more than 1,500 mu only increased by 6.6%. Later, after summarizing the situation, it was found that Huangjiapu had comprehensively applied the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," while Jacun only focused on dense planting, neglecting water, fertilizer, and other factors. This simple example illustrates that whether or not there is a leap forward depends primarily on whether the "Eight-Point Charter" is comprehensively implemented. Other places that achieved bumper wheat harvests this year also relatively comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter."
      The "Eight-Point Charter" is a summary of many years of agricultural production experience. It correctly summarizes the various basic conditions for normal crop growth and increased yield. Crops can only grow well and increase yield if they possess these conditions. The so-called comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" means comprehensively creating these conditions for crops, which conforms to the objective requirements of crop growth. A one-sided approach to the "Eight-Point Charter" means not providing crops with various necessary conditions, which violates its objective requirements. Michurin's theory holds that there is an inseparable connection between organisms and their living conditions. Organisms are no longer alive when separated from their living conditions. Therefore, the various necessary conditions for biological growth and development cannot be arbitrarily destroyed. If they are destroyed, they will not develop normally. The experiences of Huangjiapu and Jacun perfectly illustrate this principle.
    Comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" must be based on local conditions, grasping the center and driving the overall situation. In Jinxian County, Jiangxi, not only did they focus on the central link of dense planting, as did other places, but they also vigorously accumulated fertilizer and improved the soil, given that their hilly areas were mostly barren red soil, a fatal weakness. During different periods of field management, they also organized mass movements according to different circumstances: between "Heavy Snow" and "Winter Solstice," when wheat generally emerged, winter drought and lack of fertilizer affected the greening and tillering, so a "Apply Winter Fertilizer" campaign was launched. Between "Major Cold" and "Beginning of Spring," winter rains fell, and the water problem was basically solved, but there was an urgent need for nutrition, so a second topdressing was carried out. Around "Awakening of Insects," continuous spring rains caused the wheat fields to become compacted, affecting jointing, so a three-pronged assault of ditching for drainage, loosening the soil, and applying topdressing was launched. Later, around "Vernal Equinox," when wheat seedlings were in the heading stage, lodging often occurred due to strong winds and rain, and there were still many third-class seedlings in remote areas. They concentrated their main efforts on preventing lodging and eliminating third-class seedlings. In this way, a low-yield county achieved a bumper harvest, with the county's average yield per mu more than doubling last year's.
    The blooming of high yields in low-yield areas is one of the characteristics of this year's bumper wheat harvest. The increase in production in many low-yield areas is quite astonishing. In addition to Jinxian, northern Shaanxi's Weihe Plain, which has always been a low-yield area, harvested a single season of wheat equal to two seasons of grain last year. There is also the Changjiang Brigade of Changjiang Commune in Jiangning County, Jiangsu, formerly known as the "Big Water Jar," where both the yield per mu and total output of the three wheats doubled last year. It is understood that in addition to comprehensively and reasonably implementing the "Eight-Point Charter," it is particularly because they accurately recognized the main reasons for the low yield in their area and took strong measures. The "Big Water Jar" suffered from low yields due to disrepair of river embankments, chaotic water systems, a large area of land with few people, and a lack of fertilizer sources. Therefore, they established the direction of long-term struggle to fundamentally change the situation: over the past decade (especially last year), they built more than 100 water conservancy projects and carried out agricultural capital construction projects such as machinery, fertilizer, and soil. They now own more than 200 tractors, threshers, and pumps, have improved more than 2,000 mu of soil, and have more than 100 local fertilizer plants and more than 10,000 man-made manure pits, soil-smoking kilns, pigpens, and man-made underground ditches. The unfavorable conditions have been fundamentally changed, coupled with full enthusiasm and comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter," how can they not make a leap forward?
            How to Calculate Reasonably
    Over the years, various places have provided a wealth of materials showing that dense planting can increase production. The figures recorded by the Weijiayuan Management Area of the Fancun Commune in Jishan County, Shanxi, are as follows:
    1955: 12 jin of seeds per mu, 226 jin of yield per mu;
    1956: 15 jin of seeds per mu, 254 jin of yield per mu;
    1957: 18 jin of seeds per mu, 264 jin of yield per mu;
    1958: 25 jin of seeds per mu, 307 jin of yield per mu.
    Faced with such facts, it is not surprising to have the impression that "the more seeds sown, the higher the yield" and "the denser the better." However, if you follow this logic indefinitely, you will inevitably go against your wishes. Please see a survey conducted by Yinjiang County, Guizhou, during this year's wheat harvest. Under the same conditions: using 20 to 30 jin of seeds per mu generally resulted in a harvest 12 to 20 times the amount of seeds; using 40 to 80 jin of seeds per mu generally resulted in a harvest 1 to 2 times the amount of seeds; using more than 100 jin of seeds per mu resulted in a harvest half the amount of seeds, or did not even reach the amount of seeds used. Weijiayuan in Shanxi did not follow the idea of "the denser the better." They implemented a "five-look" dense planting plan, namely: one, look at the soil thickness; two, look at the amount of manure and fertilizer; three, look at the size of the seeds; four, look at the width of the sowing strip; and five, look at the earliness of the sowing period. They also divided the land into three categories, with the best land sown with 40 jin of seeds, the second-best sown with 35 jin of seeds, and the third-class land sown with 30 jin of seeds. As a result, the wheat yielded abundantly. The same is true for fertilization and deep plowing. In Meng County, Henan, Dongjie Brigade of Chengguan Commune sowed 30 jin of seeds per mu on 150 mu of high-yield fields, and applied 37.5 jin of pure nitrogen per mu. The wheat grew vigorously, with strong stalks that did not lodge, averaging 603.4 jin per mu. However, the county's Agricultural Science Research Institute sowed 18.8 jin of seeds and applied fertilizer equivalent to 55 jin of pure nitrogen per mu, resulting in complete lodging and a yield of only 425 jin per mu.
    The so-called "the denser the better," "the more the better," "the deeper the better," etc., is to believe that dense planting, fertilization, deep plowing, etc., are unconditional and limitless, and therefore can be arbitrarily disposed of by people. What is the truth? Take dense planting as an example. Indeed, increasing the amount of seeds sown can make full use of the land and increase the number of seedlings and ears. However, the normal growth of seedlings also requires maintaining a certain nutritional area and light, etc., per plant. From the survey conducted in Meng County, Henan, we will see how different amounts of seeds sown cause changes in light and nutritional area, thus causing changes in crop growth and ultimately affecting yield:
  (I) (Attached table)
    From the above, two extremely important facts can be found:
    First, dense planting is closely related to and restricted by light, nutritional area, ventilation, soil quality, variety, season, labor, etc. Therefore, it cannot be an isolated "individual hero," nor is it omnipotent. It can only increase production under the conditions of maintaining a certain nutritional area and light, etc., per plant. Indeed, there is no abstract thing in the world, no isolated thing. Everything is concrete and interconnected and restricted by surrounding things. Therefore, Marxism believes that everything depends on time, place, and conditions.
    Second, when the number of plants per mu increases from 200,000 to 350,000, the yield per mu is constantly increasing: from 459.5 jin to 556.8 jin. However, when the number of plants per mu increases further from 350,000, the yield per mu does not continue to increase, but gradually decreases (see Table 3). This phenomenon shows that "truth and falsehood, just like all logical categories moving in polar opposition, only have absolute significance within an extremely limited field; … if we attempt to apply this opposition as an absolute thing outside the above-mentioned field, then we will completely fail. That is, the opposite poles will change positions with each other, truth becomes falsehood, and falsehood becomes truth." (Engels: "Anti-Dühring"). Dense planting, like other things, has two contradictory aspects: both the side of fully utilizing the land and increasing the number of plants and ears, and the side of reducing the light and nutritional area per plant, that is, both a favorable side and an unfavorable side. Therefore, there is both the possibility of increasing production and the possibility of reducing production. Which possibility becomes a reality depends on the specific conditions. According to the survey in Meng County, Henan, when the number of plants per mu exceeds 350,000, the aspect unfavorable to crop growth begins to change from a non-major aspect to a major aspect, and therefore the yield changes from rising to falling. From this, it can be seen that dense planting is conditional and limited. Beyond a certain limit, it will "revert to the opposite," leading to a result of reduced production from a measure of increased production. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." Therefore, ideas such as "the denser the better" are contrary to objective laws and are therefore wrong. Similarly, some people see the phenomenon of reduced production due to excessive density and complain about dense planting, saying "sparse planting is still better." This is also contrary to the facts and the law of forward development of things, and is therefore also wrong. What is the fault of dense planting? The problem lies in how people grasp it.
    From the above materials, can it be considered that 30 jin of wheat seeds per mu and a yield of 556.8 jin per mu is a uniform and unchanging absolute limit? No. Taking this year alone, various places have their own characteristics in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter": some have proven that sowing about 30 jin per mu is appropriate, while others have proven that sowing about 20 jin per mu is appropriate. The yields are even more varied, ranging from about 100 jin per mu to more than 1,000 jin. If we look further ahead, to next year, the year after, and even the distant future, there will definitely be changes, just as the past becomes the present. In terms of the future development of agriculture in our country, it is unlimited, but in terms of a certain time and place, it is limited. Since liberation, agriculture in our country has been continuously rising and growing year by year, which perfectly embodies the trend that change is unlimited. However, the extent of the increase each year shows that change is limited under certain times, places, and conditions. The unlimitedness of change is achieved through concrete limitations; and it is achieved through the destruction of old limitations and the establishment of new limitations. This year's bumper wheat harvest is the result of breaking the old specifications of previous technical measures, formulating new specifications, changing old conditions, and creating new conditions. If everything remains the same and unchanged, what development and leap forward can there be? As for how much the old specifications of technical measures will change, how the change will be made, whether everything will change, and whether everything will change every year, for example, the amount of seeds sown, whether every place will have to increase it every year, it is still necessary to start from specific conditions and from the special laws of agricultural production.
    Other things are no exception. For example, with regard to people's knowledge, Engels said: "Its cognitive ability is infinite, and it is also limited. According to its nature, mission, possibility, and ultimate historical goal, it is supreme and infinite; according to its individual manifestations and realization at each specific opportunity, it is non-supreme and limited" ("Anti-Dühring").
    Since the development of things is infinite and finite, a unity of infinity and finiteness, then the combination of soaring enthusiasm and the spirit of scientific analysis is reasonable; that is, it is reasonable to consider both maximizing the yield-increasing effect of the "Eight-Point Charter" and determining appropriate goals based on time, place, and conditions. Also, since the forward development of things must be the breaking of old limitations and the establishment of new limitations, then the combination of bold innovation and starting from reality is reasonable; that is, it is reasonable to advocate breaking old indicators and specifications and to formulate new realistic indicators and specifications based on time and place.
            Area and Yield per Unit
    In this year's wheat production, a very important issue was also raised: how to increase the total output? Some places have solved this problem well, such as Yangzhong County, Jiangsu, where not only did the yield per unit of the three wheats increase by 82.9% compared to last year, but also the total output increased by 93.77% compared to last year. The county's surplus grain sold increased from 1.7 million jin last year to 10.17 million jin, with more than 95% of the commune members increasing their income, and the rations distributed to commune members were also more than last year. One of their experiences is particularly worth mentioning, that is, "while striving to increase the yield per unit, they did everything possible not to reduce and even expand the planting area." However, other places reduced the planting area when cultivating "high-yield plots," and as a result, although the yield per unit increased, the total output did not increase. This is indeed a lesson.
    This year's practice proves that to increase the total agricultural output, both planting area and yield per unit must be taken into account. If one aspect is emphasized one-sidedly while the other aspect is neglected, the goal will not be achieved. Planting area and yield per unit are a unity of opposites. There is a contradiction between them, for example, if the planting area is too large, it will inevitably affect the improvement of yield per unit; and paying more attention to improving yield per unit will also make it difficult to take care of large fields. However, these two aspects are at the same time mutually dependent and presuppose each other: that is, it is necessary to increase the yield per unit on the basis of maintaining a certain planting area, and to maintain a certain planting area under the requirement of increasing the yield per unit. No matter when, even in the future when "planting less and harvesting more" is achieved, it will still be necessary to consider both the planting area and the yield per unit, to carefully determine how much area to plant, and to work hard to increase the yield per unit, and neither should be neglected.

    从今年小麦丰收想到的
    谢平仄
    人们在欢庆今年小麦大面积丰收的同时，正从各个方面总结丰收的经验。今年小麦的丰收再一次证明：凡是人们的思想行动符合客观规律，结果一定美满；反之，人们的思想行动违反了客观规律，结果就不美妙。
            全面与中心
    山东淄博市淄城公社里两个生产大队，黄家铺和贾村，历年来，贾村的小麦亩产量，都高于黄家铺；今年却变了样，黄家铺大大超过了贾村：黄家铺的二千七百多亩小麦平均亩产比去年增加了一倍，而贾村的一千五百多亩亩产只增加6.6％。后来一总结，原来是黄家铺全面运用了“八字宪法”，贾村却只抓了密植，丢了水肥和其他。这个简单的例子说明了，跃进与否，首先取决于贯彻“八字宪法”是否全面。今年小麦获得丰收的其他地方，也都是比较全面地贯彻了“八字宪法”。
      “八字宪法”是对多年来农业生产经验的总结，它正确地概括了农作物正常生长和增产的各种基本条件。作物只有具备了这些条件，才能生长良好，增加产量。所谓全面地贯彻“八字宪法”，就是为作物全面地创造这些条件，这样就符合了作物生长的客观要求。片面对待“八字宪法”，就是不让作物具备各种必要的条件，这就违背了它的客观要求。米丘林学说认为，生物与其生活条件有不容分割的联系，生物离开了它的生活条件，就不再是活的。因此生物赖以生长发展的各种必要条件是不能任意破坏的。破坏了，它们就得不到正常的发展。黄家铺和贾村的经验，正好说明了这个道理。
    全面贯彻“八字宪法”，必须根据当地情况，抓住中心，带动全面。江西进贤县，不仅和其他地方一样，抓好了密植这个中心环节；而且根据他们的山岗丘陵都是贫瘠的红土这个致命弱点，大搞积肥和改良土壤。在田间管理的不同时期，又根据不同的情况先后组织了群众运动：在“大雪”到“冬至”间，小麦普遍出苗，遇到冬旱缺肥，影响了返青发蔸，因此开展了“施腊肥”运动。在“大寒”到
  “立春”间，下了冬雨，水的问题基本解决，但急需营养，便展开了第二次追肥。在“惊蛰”前后，春雨连绵，麦田板结，影响拔节，便开展了开沟排水，松土，追肥三突击。后来在“春分”前后正当麦苗孕穗时，常因狂风暴雨，发生倒伏，而且边远地区还有不少三类苗。他们便集中主要力量去防治倒伏和消灭三类苗。就这样，低产县丰收了，全县平均亩产比去年高出两倍。
    低产区盛开高产之花，是今年小麦丰产的特色之一。不少低产区增产的幅度是非常惊人的。除了进贤，一向低产的陕西渭北，一季麦抵上去年两季粮。还有过去叫作“大水缸”的江苏江宁县长江公社长江大队，三麦的亩产和总产都比去年增加一倍。据了解，除了贯彻“八字宪法”全面又合理以外，特别是因为他们对于造成本地区低产的主要原因认得准，措施抓得狠。“大水缸”因为江堤失修，水系混乱，地多人少，肥源缺少，是低产的病根，因而确立了长期奋战，根本改变面貌的方向：十年来（特别是去年）他们兴修了一百多项水利工程，进行了机械、肥料、土壤等项农业基本建设，现在他们拥有拖拉机、脱粒机、抽水机等二百多台，改良土壤二千多亩，土化肥厂一百多个，人造粪坑、熏土窑、猪圈、人造阴沟等一万多个，不利条件得到了基本改变，加上十足的干劲和全面贯彻“八字宪法”，怎能不猛跃呢？
            怎样算合理
    历年来，各地都提供了密植能够增产的大量材料。山西稷山县樊村公社魏家院管理区记载的数字是这样的：
    1955年亩播十二斤，亩产二百二十六斤；
    1956年亩播十五斤，亩产二百五十四斤；
    1957年亩播十八斤，亩产二百六十四斤；
    1958年亩播二十五斤，亩产三百零七斤。
    面对这样的事实，产生“下籽越多产量越高”和“越密越好”的印象，是不足为奇的。但是按照这样的逻辑无限制地做下去，就不免事与愿违了。请看贵州印江县在今年小麦收割时作的一次调查。在同样的条件下：每亩用种二十斤到三十斤的，收获量一般比种子量增长十二倍到二十倍；每亩用种四十斤到八十斤的，收获量一般比种子量增长一倍到二倍；每亩用种一百斤以上的，收获量比种子量增长半倍，或者达不到用种量。山西的魏家院，没有按照“越密越好”的主张办，他们实行了“五看”的密植方案，即一看土壤厚薄，二看粪肥多少，三看籽粒大小，四看播幅宽窄，五看播期早晚。还把土地分为三类，顶好的下籽四十斤，次好的下籽三十五斤，三等地下籽三十斤。结果小麦丰产了。施肥和深耕等等也是这样。河南孟县城关公社东街大队一百五十亩丰产田每亩播种三十斤，每亩折合施用纯氮三十七点五斤，麦禾生长健壮、秆硬不倒，平均亩产六百零三点四斤。而县农业科学研究所播种十八点八斤，施肥量折合每亩纯氮达五十五斤，结果全部倒伏，亩产仅四百二十五斤。
    所谓“越密越好”、“越多越好”、“越深越好”之类，就是认为密植、施肥、深耕等等，是没有条件的，没有限度的，因而可以由人们任意处置。事实究竟怎样呢？以密植为例。的确，增加播种量，能够充分利用土地，能够增加禾苗的株数和穗数。但是禾苗的正常生长，同时要求保持单株一定的营养面积和光照等等。从河南孟县所作的调查中，将会看到：由于播种量的不同，怎样引起光照和营养面积的变化，因而引起作物生长状况的变化，以及最终怎样影响产量的：
  （一）（附表格）
    从上面可以发现两个极为重要的事实：
    第一、密植与光照，与营养面积，其实还与通风、土质、品种、季节、劳力等等都有着密切的联系，并受它们的制约。所以它既不能孤立地闹“个人英雄”，也不是万能的；它只有在保持单株一定的营养面积和光照等等条件下才能增加产量。的确，世界上没有抽象的东西，没有孤立的东西，任何东西都是具体的，都是与周围事物相互联系、相互制约的；所以马克思主义认为：一切都依时间、地点、条件为转移。
    第二、当每亩株数由二十万向三十五万增加的时候，亩产量在不断提高：由四百五十九点五斤提高到五百五十六点八斤；而当每亩株数由三十五万再往上增加以后，亩产量却不是继续提高，而是逐渐下降了（见表三）。这个现象说明：“真理与谬误，正如一切在两极对立之中运动着的逻辑范畴一样，都仅仅在极其局限的领域内才具有绝对的意义；……如果我们企图在上述领域之外把这个对立当作绝对的东西来应用，那末我们就会完全失败。即是，对立的两极就会互相变换位置，真理变成谬误，谬误变成真理。”（恩格斯：“反杜林论”）密植也和其他事情一样，有着矛盾的两方面，既有充分利用土地和增加株数穗数的一面，同时又有减少单株的光照和营养面积的一面，即有有利的一面，又有不利的一面；因而既有增产的可能，又有减产的可能。哪个可能变成现实，就要看具体的条件。河南孟县的调查，当每亩株数超过三十五万以后，不利于庄稼生长的一面，开始由非主要的方面转为主要的方面，因而产量就由上升转向下降了。由此可见，密植是有条件的，有限度的。超过了一定的限度，它就会“物极必反”，由增产的措施引出减产的结果。正如毛泽东同志所说：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”所以，“越密越好”之类的想法是违背客观规律性的，因而是错误的。同样，有些人看到因过密而减产的现象，就埋怨密植，说 “还是稀植好”，也是违反事实，违反事物向前发展的规律的，因而也是错误的。密植有什么过错呢？问题在于人掌握得如何。
    从上面的材料中，是否能认为小麦亩播三十斤，亩产五五六点八斤，就是千篇一律，一成不变的绝对界限？不能。单拿今年来说，各地贯彻“八字宪法”各有千秋：有的证明亩播三十斤左右为宜，有的则证明亩播二十斤左右为宜。产量更是千差万别，从亩产百斤左右到千斤以上都有。如果再往前看，看明年，看后年以至遥远的将来，变化肯定还会有的，正像过去会变成现在一样。就我国农业发展的前途说来，是无限的，但就一定的时间地点说来，它又是有限的。解放以来我国农业不断上升，年年增长，正好体现了变化是无限的这种趋向。但每年上升的幅度，又表现出变化在一定时间、地点、条件下是有限的。变化的无限性，是通过具体的有限性实现的；而且是通过对旧的限度的破坏，和新的限度的建立来实现的。今年小麦丰收，就是打破了以前技术措施的旧规格，制定了新规格，改变了旧条件，创立了新条件的结果。如果一切依然故我、原封不动，有何发展和跃进可言？至于技术措施的旧规格变多少，如何变法，是否样样变，年年变，例如播种量，是否块块地方年年都得增加？还要从具体条件出发，从农业生产的特殊规律出发。
    其他事情也不例外。如人们的认识，恩格斯说过：“它的认识能力是无限的，同样又是有限的。根据它的素质、使命、可能性、历史的最终目标说来，它是至上的和无限的；根据它的个别表现和在每一特定时机的实现说来，它是非至上的和有限的”（“反杜林论”）。
    既然事物的发展是无限的，又是有限的，是无限与有限的统一，那么冲天的干劲与科学分析的精神的结合就是合理的；也就是既考虑到最大限度地发挥“八字宪法”的增产作用，又从时间、地点、条件出发，确定适当的目标，才是合理的。又既然事物向前的发展必然是旧的限度的打破，新的限度的建定，那么大胆革新和从实际出发的结合就是合理的；也就是既主张打破旧的指标和规格，又因时、因地地制定新的现实的指标和规格，才是合理的。
            面积与单产
    在今年小麦生产中，还提出了一个十分重要的问题：即如何提高总产量？对这个问题，有些地方解决得较好，如江苏扬中县，不仅三麦的单产比去年增长82.9％，而且总产量比去年增长93.77％，全县售余粮从去年的一百七十万斤增加到一千零十七万斤，增加收入的社员占95％以上，社员分得的口粮也比去年多。他们的经验中有一条值得特别一提，就是“既力争单位产量增长；又尽一切可能不减少而且扩大了种植面积。”而另一些地方由于在培植“丰产方”的时候，减少了播种面积，结果，虽然单位面积增产了，但总产量没有增加。这的确是一个教训。
    今年的实践证明：要提高农业总产量，必须种植面积和单位产量兼顾。如果片面地强调一个方面，忽视另一个方面，都达不到目的。种植面积与单位产量是对立的统一。它们之间有矛盾，例如种植面积过多了，难免影响单产的提高；而较多地注意提高单产，也难以照顾大田。然而，这两个方面同时是相互依赖、互为前提的：这就是要在保持一定种植面积的基础上提高单产，在提高单产的要求下保持一定的种植面积。不管到什么时候，就是将来实现了“少种多收”，也还是必须既考虑种植面积，又考虑单位产量，既要认真确定种多少面积，又要努力提高单产，不能偏废。
