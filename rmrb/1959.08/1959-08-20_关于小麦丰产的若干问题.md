    Several Questions Concerning Wheat High Yields
　　Secretary-General of the Crop Society of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology, Bu Muhua
    Editor's note: From August 10th to 12th, the Crop Society of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology Preparatory Committee held a scientific discussion meeting on wheat high yields. Those attending the meeting included production leaders from various districts in the suburbs of Beijing, experienced old farmers, and scientific research workers. Among the research workers were senior and young experts in various disciplines such as agronomy, plant physiology, plant ecology and morphology, soil science, fertilizer science, microbiology, and agricultural meteorology. Everyone had conducted investigations and studies on wheat high yields from various perspectives. At the meeting, everyone conducted heated discussions based on their investigations and studies, and put forward opinions on several technical issues of wheat high yields. The following article is written by the author based on the discussions at the meeting and is worth referring to.
          The Superiority of Deep Plowing
    At the wheat high yield scientific discussion meeting held by the Beijing Association for Science and Technology Crop Society, there were a total of four reports on the issue of deep plowing, all of which affirmed the superiority of deep plowing. The Institute of Soil and Fertilizer of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Wheat High Yield Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have both proven that deep plowing combined with fertilization thickens the soil layer, creates suitable porosity for crop root growth, increases soil moisture content, and improves soil temperature in winter. The Institute of Microbiology proved that under deep plowing and heavy fertilization conditions, the total amount of bacteria increases, and the activity, respiratory capacity, and decomposition fiber strength of the bacteria also increase, the carbon-nitrogen ratio decreases, and the available nutrients in the soil increase, creating a good growth environment for wheat roots. The Institute of Soil and Fertilizer proposed that deep plowing can also regulate soil moisture and air, and the original contradiction between water retention and permeability can coexist, that is, after breaking the plow pan that has been left for many years, it not only increases air permeability but also enhances water permeability, and both water retention and moisture content increase, and the reserve space for nutrients in the soil also expands. Therefore, the chemical and physical properties in the soil layer are improved after deep plowing, which can make wheat grow better. Production units have also affirmed the yield-increasing effect of deep plowing.
          Is There a Limit to Deep Plowing?
    But is there a limit to deep plowing? Everyone's understanding is also consistent, that there is a limit. It should be limited not only because the labor consumption is too large and the economic accounting is not worthwhile, but also in the observation of natural phenomena, too deep is harmful. This is the case regardless of the materials from the Institute of Soil and Fertilizer, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, or the Academy of Agricultural Mechanization. Even if the land is cultivated to three feet or deeper, the dense layer of wheat roots is still mainly distributed at zero to twenty centimeters, accounting for about 40%-45% of the total root mass; the zero to fifty centimeter soil layer accounts for about 65% of the total root mass. Although the lower roots have a tendency to extend downward with the depth of cultivation, the number is very small, and the root mass below one hundred centimeters does not exceed 5% at most. Therefore, the effect of cultivating too deeply is not significant. According to microbiological research, after the cultivation layer is too deep, some anaerobic microorganisms proliferate in the lower soil, which enhances the reducing properties of the environment and is not conducive to the respiration of plant roots. Among them, sulfur-reducing bacteria can reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide, which can poison the roots. This may explain why the roots of wheat in some experimental fields do not take root downward after being cultivated too deeply.
    According to the results of the research, in the case of fertilizer cooperation, deep plowing to fifty centimeters (that is, one and a half feet) is the most suitable. Considering the current labor force and other conditions, everyone believes that the current appropriate depth of deep plowing in production should be six inches to one foot, which can be completed in stages within three years, which can both increase production and is completely achievable.
  How Much Fertilizer to Apply and When to Apply It
    There are five reports on fertilization and irrigation. It is easy to understand that increasing fertilizer application can increase production, but what everyone is most concerned about is how much to apply and when to apply it. Especially in the case of our vast land and not very abundant fertilizer, how should we use it to be the most economical and effective. The "Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium Analysis of Wheat Soil, Wheat Plants, and Grains in Wheat Fields" conducted by the Institute of Soil and Fertilizer aroused everyone's attention. The results show that increasing the amount of fertilizer can certainly increase yield, but under similar fertilizer application rates, the utilization rate of plants often varies greatly, resulting in very different yield ranges. For example, in a wheat field in Dazhongsi People's Commune in Haidian District, Beijing, 30 jin of nitrogen fertilizer was applied per mu, with a utilization rate of up to 53.7%, and a yield of 695 jin per mu, while in a wheat field in Yuetan Brigade in Yanshi, Henan, 48 jin of nitrogen fertilizer was applied per mu, with a utilization rate of only 23.1%, and a yield of only 493 jin per mu. This shows that improper fertilization techniques can greatly reduce the utilization rate. The former used 10,000 jin of soil manure as base fertilizer, while the latter used 5,000 jin of soil manure as base fertilizer and 6,000 jin as winter fertilizer, it is likely that the winter fertilizer had little effect, thus reducing the utilization rate. The most successful result of wheat cultivation is that the grain has a high nitrogen content; the straw has a low nitrogen content, and the yield ratio of grain to straw is large; the result of unsuccessful wheat cultivation is often the opposite. According to the analysis results, in the medium fertility level of 400-600 jin of wheat per mu, every 100 jin of grain requires about 2-3 jin of nitrogen, 1-2 jin of phosphoric acid, and 3-5 jin of potassium oxide. The difference in the degree is due to the difference in fertilizer utilization rate. High fertilization significantly reduces the utilization rate. For example, in the control field of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 144 jin of nitrogen fertilizer was applied per mu, and the yield of wheat per mu was 712 jin. Although the nitrogen content in the grain was as high as 2.37% (the nitrogen content in the grain with 30-40 jin of nitrogen fertilizer applied per mu was around 1.5%), which improved the quality, the fertilizer utilization rate was only 21.37%. Judging from the current fertilizer situation in our country, it is obviously uneconomical to concentrate high fertilization in a few fields. We must advocate universal and economical application.
    During the discussion at the meeting, everyone agreed with the argument of the Soil Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that emphasis should be placed on the application of base fertilizer, but had different opinions on the statement that "applying more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu will not significantly increase production compared to applying 10,000 jin" and "if the amount of base fertilizer is insufficient, it is difficult to achieve high yields even if topdressing and irrigation are carried out in the later stage." It was believed that 10,000 jin of base fertilizer is not a high limit, and more application can still increase production. If topdressing and irrigation can be carried out in a timely manner in the later stage when the base fertilizer is insufficient, high yields can still be achieved.
    There was a lot of controversy about whether it is necessary to apply winter cover manure in the Beijing area. Most people believe that the fertilizer is seriously lost when the cover manure is spread on the surface, and wheat absorbs very little, so it is better to use it as base fertilizer. However, some people believe that cover manure has the effect of keeping warm and protecting seedlings in winter, which must be achieved with a thicker fertilizer layer. From the perspective of comprehensive fertilization, soil manure is still suitable as base fertilizer; but if the base fertilizer of wheat was originally insufficient, and some fertilizer has been accumulated in winter, this fertilizer can also be mixed with fine soil and applied within the wheat ridges, which is beneficial to the growth of wheat in the coming year.
    The Institute of Botany observed the development of the growth cone of wheat and found that fertilization and irrigation during spike differentiation are the most effective, which can increase spike length and number of spikelets. The Institute of Soil and Fertilizer also believes that the greening and jointing period is the most important period for wheat to accumulate nutrients based on plant analysis results, so this is the most important period for topdressing. Fertilization at the time of heading and flowering can increase the number and fullness of grains. Therefore, in areas with conditions, it is not advisable to lack fertilizer and water at this time.
    Excessive fertilization can have adverse effects. When 400,000 jin of soil manure was applied per mu in the wheat test field of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the salt content of the soil reached 0.25%, which affected the growth of the roots. In the test field of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences where 1,750 jin of nitrogen fertilizer was applied per mu, wheat only absorbed 30 jin, and 520 jin remained in the soil after harvest, of which 1,200 jin were lost. Wheat grows very abnormally under excessive fertility, so excessive fertilization is a waste.
    Judging from the current production conditions, general land still lacks nitrogen fertilizer, and it should be applied as long as there is fertilizer. In terms of utilization rate, fertilizer application on poor land is higher than on fertile land, and fertilizer application on irrigated land is higher than on dry land. Fertilization should be reasonable, with general soil manure as base fertilizer and quick-acting fertilizer as topdressing. Irrigated land can be applied with 5,000-15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, with 5 jin of ammonium sulfate as seed fertilizer and 15-20 jin as topdressing, which can obtain a yield of 300-700 jin. When the amount of topdressing is small, it should be applied once during the greening and jointing period, and when the amount is sufficient, it can be applied twice.
        The Issue of Rational Close Planting
    There are as many as eight reports on close planting, and the research content is also very in-depth. In addition to observing the changes in the number of plants, ears, and grains under different densities, some research institutions and colleges also made observations on morphological anatomy and ecological factors within the community, such as light quality, light quantity, temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide. Everyone's interest is also the most intense. Judging from the research results of various aspects in the Beijing area, rational close planting is definitely the central link in increasing production. From low fertility to medium fertility levels below 600 jin per mu, with the gradual increase in sowing amount, the number of plants and ears increases proportionally. In the initial increase, due to the increase in fertility, the number of grains per ear also increases, thus increasing the yield. After the number of ears increases to a certain limit, the number of grains per ear begins to decrease, but the number of ears increases more, and the number of grains per ear decreases slowly, so the total number of grains in the whole field still increases, and the yield continues to rise. When the number of ears increases to another limit, due to early lodging or abnormal growth, the number of grains per ear decreases significantly, and the increased number of ears cannot offset the reduced number of grains, and the yield turns downward. This is the turning point of close planting. When talking about the range of sowing amount at the meeting, it was believed that it can be controlled between 15 jin and 40 jin according to different conditions. According to everyone's research and practice results, in the suburbs of Beijing, in medium fertility irrigated land, it is a relatively consistent view that a sowing amount of 20-30 jin, maintaining a basic seedling of 250,000-350,000 plants, and 400,000-600,000 ears is a reasonable range. What is different is whether the sowing amount in dry and thin land should be less or more? Is the sowing amount in highly fertile land less or more? In terms of dry and thin land, Changxindian in Fengtai District advocates that dry land should use 5 jin more seeds than irrigated land, 25-35 jin per mu, to ensure a certain number of ears and strive for more harvest. Most people believe that in the case of lack of fertilizer and water, too much sowing is not enough to supply the growth of seedlings, and the plants are extremely short, it is better to sow less and distribute evenly to grow well. For dry land wheat fields in the suburbs of Beijing, under normal circumstances, it is more appropriate to increase the sowing amount to 15-20 jin per mu on the original basis; after the fertility is improved and water conservancy is built, the sowing amount can be appropriately increased.
    After the land fertility is raised to a higher level, the seedlings grow vigorously, and early tillering is vigorous. If the sowing amount is too large, it is easy to form seedling closure, which is not conducive to the strong development of stems. At this time, the sowing amount must be appropriately reduced to promote healthy and strong effective tillering; if the land fertility level reaches a high yield of around 1,000 jin, this aspect should be considered.
      Does Increased Production Rely on Main Spikes or Tillers?
    Regarding whether yield depends on the main spikes or tillers, everyone's understanding is relatively consistent. In wheat fields with a yield of less than 600 jin per mu, the general tillering of single plants in the field is between 1.1 and 1.6, that is, one main tiller has only 0.1 to 0.6 tillers, and the main spike rate accounts for about 60%-90% of the total number of spikes. At this level, as long as the fertility keeps up, increasing plants and spikes can increase production. Therefore, the yield depends on the main spikes, and it is necessary to ensure that there are enough main spikes. But relying on the main spikes does not mean relying only on the main spikes, and high yield must include a part of the tiller spikes. If tiller spikes cannot be formed, it must be due to insufficient nutrition or light, thus affecting the healthy growth of the whole plant and the yield cannot be improved. According to observations, if wheat plants can grow three to five tillers before winter, the permanent roots will also grow well; if the wheat leaves crawl like chrysanthemum petals after winter, several tiller spikes can be formed in the coming year, and good wheat can be grown. On the contrary, if the plants are crowded, the seedlings do not form tillers, no permanent roots occur, the growth will be extremely abnormal, the total number of ears formed is lower than the number of plants, and the yield will be greatly reduced. But judging from the current field level, single-plant tillering is not easy to exceed 1.6, and tiller spikes are ultimately secondary in yield. In the current stage in our country of hoping to increase the national average wheat yield from less than 200 jin per mu to 600 jin, emphasizing relying on the main spikes is the main thing. While relying on the main spikes, we must also strive to increase the proportion of tiller spikes at the cultivation level, so that the yield can continue to increase, which is a dialectical relationship of mutual action.
    In terms of preventing lodging, in addition to fertilizer and water factors, when the seedlings are excessively crowded and lack light, the internodes of the wheat stems are slender, the mechanical tissues are very underdeveloped, and the surface cells cannot be lignified, which can form seedling lodging. At this time, only thinning and light transmission can improve the lodging situation. Some sowing amounts are suitable for seedling growth in the early stage, but are still too dense after jointing, resulting in soft stem lodging and reduced yield before and after heading. Therefore, when determining the sowing amount, we must consider the number of basic seedlings, the degree of land fertility, the number of tillers, and the degree of dense shading of the plants after growth, so that the growth period will not lodge and finally achieve a bumper harvest.
    Generally, wheat fields with late lodging are mostly fertile and grow vigorously, which may lead to high yields. Some comrades from Beijing Agricultural University put forward the argument that late lodging is a sign of high yield. However, many comrades believe that this statement is not accurate enough. Of course, low-yielding wheat will not lodge, and the possibility of lodging in high-yielding fields is high, and the latter yield may exceed the former, but lodging is ultimately a symptom, and it will always affect the yield when it occurs. Only by fully overcoming the lodging phenomenon on the basis of high yield, and making wheat high-yielding to the end, is the goal we are pursuing.
    In general, the sowing density in the suburbs of Beijing this year has a fairly consistent view, but one point that should be noted is that many wheat fields have poor emergence after sowing and low plant establishment rate, generally around 70%, as low as 50%. In addition to trying to improve the quality of land preparation and sowing, in the case that it cannot be overcome temporarily, we have to increase the sowing amount according to the actual plant establishment rate, so as to avoid too few basic seedlings and fail to reach the required number of ears. In addition, Yanqing is located outside the pass and has a cold climate, so it can be sown more appropriately.
          Sowing Period and Varieties
    In addition to this, the issue of sowing period was also discussed. The Institute of Botany believes that the most suitable sowing period in the suburbs of Beijing is September 15-23 according to the growth of wheat seedlings last year; many comrades believe that the sowing period should be considered in combination with other conditions. For example, in dry land, due to poor growth before winter, sowing can be slightly advanced, while irrigation land and fertile land can be appropriately delayed to avoid excessive growth before winter and easy frost damage. Local varieties such as Hongmangbai and Qitoubai have strong cold resistance and winter hardiness, and can be sown appropriately early. Improved varieties are suitable for planting in irrigated land, and generally have weaker cold resistance. Especially Bima No. 1 is a semi-winter variety and cannot be sown too early. If it is sown too early, it is not only susceptible to frost damage, but also easily induces rust disease. However, if it is sown too late, the wheat seedlings will not develop enough, which will inevitably lead to reduced production. It is even worse to sow late. Generally speaking, the proverb "Early White Dew, Late Cold Dew, Autumn Equinox is the Right Time to Sow Wheat" is the most appropriate in the areas within the pass. The research results of the Agricultural Meteorological Research Office have also proved this point. In Yanqing, it is more appropriate to advance the sowing to White Dew because winter comes earlier. Generally, early sowing can appropriately reduce the sowing amount, and late sowing should be appropriately increased.
    In terms of varieties, due to the transfer of Bima No. 1 last year, it performed well, with large ears and full grains, which was loved by farmers and competed to expand planting. However, considering that this variety is native to Wugong, Shaanxi, and belongs to semi-winter type, with weak cold resistance, the absolute minimum temperature in Beijing last winter was only -18℃, which was 2°—4℃ higher than in previous years, so it could safely cross the winter. When the low temperature in Yanqing reached -28℃, 30%—60% of frost damage occurred. Under the winter meteorological conditions in Beijing, Bima No. 1 is not a reliable application variety. At present, Nongda 183, Nongda 90, Huabei 187, and Zaoyangmai are still used in irrigated land; 1885, Hongmangbai, and Qitoubai are used in dry land. Bima No. 1 can only be planted in a small amount of fertile land.

    关于小麦丰产的若干问题
　　北京市科协作物学会秘书长　卜慕华
    编者按：8月10日到12日，北京市科学技术协会筹委会作物学会召开了一次小麦丰产科学讨论会。出席会议的，有京郊各区的生产领导者，有经验丰富的老农，有科学研究工作者。在研究工作者里面，有农学、植物生理学、植物生态形态学、土壤学、肥料学、微生物学、农业气象学等各门学科的老专家与青年专家。大家曾由各个角度对小麦丰产进行了调查研究。会上，大家根据自己调查研究所得，进行了热烈的讨论，对小麦丰产的若干技术问题提出了意见。下面的文章是作者根据会议的讨论撰写的，值得参考。
          深耕的优越性
    在北京科协作物学会召开的小麦丰产科学讨论会上有关深耕问题的报告共有四篇，全都肯定了深耕的优越性。中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所及中国科学院小麦丰产组，都证明深耕结合施肥后加厚了松土层，创造了作物根系生长所需要的适宜孔隙度，增加了土壤含水率，提高了冬季土壤温度。微生物研究所证明在深耕多肥的条件下，增加了菌的总量，也增加了菌的活动能力，呼吸能力和分解纤维强度都增加了，碳氮比值降低，土壤中可给性养分增多，给小麦根部创造了优良的生长环境。土壤肥料研究所提出深耕还可以调节土壤水分和空气，持水性和透水性原来并存的矛盾，也就是说把多年遗留的犁底层耕破以后，既增加了透气性又增强了透水性，持水量和含水量都增加了，土壤内养分的储备空间也扩大了，所以深耕后土层内化学性物理性都有了改善，这样可以使小麦长得更好。生产单位也都肯定了深耕的增产效果。
          深耕有没有限度
    但是深耕有没有限度呢？大家认识也是一致的，是有限度的。不仅仅由于劳力消耗过大和经济核算上划不来而应有限度，就是在自然现象中观察，也是过深了反而有坏处。无论就土壤肥料研究所、中国科学院或农业机械化学院哪方面材料来看，都是如此。土地尽管耕到三尺或更深，而小麦的根系密集层仍旧主要分布在零——二十厘米处，这里约占全根量40％—45％；在零——五十厘米土层内共占根量65％左右。下层根系虽然随耕深有向下延长趋势，但数量很微，到一百厘米土层以下，根量最多不超过5％。因此，耕得过深时效果并不显著。根据微生物方面的研究，耕层过深之后，下层土壤增殖了一些嫌气性微生物，使环境还原性增强，不利于植物根系呼吸，其中反硫化菌能使硫酸盐还原成二硫化氢，能使根部中毒，这可能说明为什么有些试验田耕得过深以后，小麦的根反而不下扎的缘故之一了。
    就研究的结果来看，在有肥料配合的情况下，以深耕到五十厘米（即一尺半）为最合适。考虑到目前的劳力与其他条件，大家认为目前生产上的深耕适度应为六寸到一尺，在三年内分期完成，是既能增产又完全可以办得到的。
  肥料施多少，什么时候施
    在施肥灌水方面有五篇报告。增施肥料能增产是容易理解的事，但大家最关心的是施多少及什么时候施用。尤其是我们土地广大，在肥料还不太充裕的情况下，应该如何使用才最经济有效。土壤肥料研究所进行的“麦田土壤小麦植株及籽粒的含氮、磷、钾分析工作”引起了大家的注意。结果说明，施肥量增加，产量固然可以增加，但在近似的施肥量下，植株的利用率常常有很大的差异，以致产量幅度很不相同。如北京海淀区大钟寺人民公社一块小麦地，亩施氮肥折合三十斤，利用率高达53.7％，亩产六百九十五斤，而河南偃师岳滩大队一块麦地亩施氮肥四十八斤，利用率只有23.1％，亩产只四百九十三斤。这说明施肥技术不当时，可大大减低利用率。前者用了土粪一万斤做基肥，后者用了五千斤土粪做基肥，六千斤做腊肥，很可能腊肥的作用很小，因此减低了利用率。栽培小麦最成功的结果是籽粒中含氮量高；藁秆中含氮量少，籽粒与藁秆的产量比值大；不成功的小麦栽培所得的结果常常与此相反。根据分析结果，在中等肥力亩产小麦四百——六百斤水平内，每百斤籽实约需氮二——三斤、磷酸一——二斤、氧化钾三——五，这里面程度的不同，就是由于肥料利用率有差异。高度的施肥，利用率就显著降低。如农业科学院的对照田，亩施氮肥一百四十四斤，亩产小麦七百一十二斤，虽然籽实中含氮量高达2.37％（亩施氮三十——四十斤的籽实含氮量为1.5％上下），改善了品质，但肥料利用率只有21.37％。就目前我国肥料现状来看，集中在少数田中高度施肥，显然是不经济的。要提倡施得普遍，施得经济。
    会议在讨论时，大家虽同意中国科学院土壤队重视施用基肥的论点，但对所提“亩施基肥万斤以上，就比施万斤的不再显著地增产”的说法和“如果基肥用量不足，后期即使追肥灌水也难高产”的说法，有不同意见。认为一万斤基肥还不是高限，多施还可以增产。在基肥不足时，如果后期能及时追肥灌水，是同样可以获得高产的。
    对于北京地区在冬季施用蒙头粪有无必要，有不少争论。多数认为蒙头粪施撒在地表，肥分损失严重，小麦吸收很少，不如改用为基肥。但也有人认为蒙头粪在冬季有保温护苗作用，这必须肥层较厚才有效果。就全面施肥来看，土粪仍以作基肥为宜；但如小麦底粪原来不足，冬季积存了些肥料，也可以把这些肥料与细土混合，施在麦垅以内，这对来年小麦返青生长是有利的。
    植物研究所从小麦生长锥的发育观察上看出在穗分化时施肥灌水效果最显著，可增加穗长与小穗数。土壤肥料研究所根据植株分析结果，也认为返青拔节期是小麦积累养分最重要时期，所以这时为追肥最重要时期。在出穗开花时施肥可增加籽粒数目及饱满度。所以在有条件地区，这时候也不宜缺肥缺水。
    施肥过多会产生不利影响。中国科学院小麦试验田亩施四十万斤土粪时，土壤含盐量达到了0.25％，影响了根系的生长。中国农业科学院亩施氮肥一千七百五十斤的试验田，小麦只吸收了三十斤，收获后土壤中遗留了五百二十斤，其中一千二百斤都损失了。小麦在过高肥力下生长也极不正常，因此施肥过多是浪费的。
    根据目前生产条件看，一般土地还嫌氮肥过少，只要有肥就应施用。就利用率讲，瘦地施肥要比肥地高，灌溉地施肥要比旱地高。施肥要合理，一般土粪做基肥，速效肥做追肥。灌溉地亩施肥五千——一万五千斤，用五斤硫铵做种肥，十五——二十斤做追肥，可以获得三百——七百斤的产量。追肥数量不多时，应在返青拔节时一次施用，数量充裕时可分两次施用。
        合理密植的问题
    密植报告有八篇之多，研究内容也很深入。除了观察不同密度的株、穗、粒数量变化外，有些研究机关、院校还做了形态解剖及群落内部生态因子如光质光量、温湿度、二氧化碳等方面观测。大家兴趣也最浓厚。就北京地区各方面研究结果来看，合理密植肯定是增产的中心环节。从低肥力到中等肥力水平亩产六百斤以下水平的土地，在配合施肥的情况下，随播种量的逐渐提高，株数穗数都正比例地增加。在初增加时，由于肥力的递增，每穗粒数也同样增加，因此产量提高。到穗数增加到一定限度后，每穗粒数开始减少，但穗数增加多，每穗粒数降低慢，因此全田总粒数仍旧增加，产量继续上升。当穗数再度提高到另一限度，由于早期倒伏或生长不正常，每穗粒数显著降低，所增的穗数不能抵偿减少的粒数，产量乃转向下降。此即密植的转折点。会上谈到播种量的幅度时，认为可根据不同的条件掌握在十五斤到四十斤之间。根据大家研究及实践结果，在京郊中等肥力灌溉地以播种量二十——三十斤，保持基本苗二十五——三十五万株，成穗四十——六十万个为合理的范围，是比较一致的看法。看法不同的是旱薄地的播种量究竟少些好还是多些好？高度肥沃地播种量又是少些好还是多些好？在旱薄地方面，丰台区长辛店就是主张旱地用种比灌溉地多五斤，每亩用二十五——三十五斤，以保证有一定穗数争取多收。大部分认为在肥水都缺的情况下，播种多了养份不足以供养幼苗生长，植株发育极为矮小，不如播种较少，分布均匀的生长得好。就京郊旱地麦田来说，在通常情况下，应在原来基础上提高到亩播十五斤——二十斤比较合适；到肥力提高，水利兴办以后，播种量可以适当增加。
    当地力提到更高水平以后，幼苗植株生长繁茂，早期分蘖旺盛，若播种量过多，易于形成苗期郁闭，不利茎秆的坚强发育，此时又必须将播种量适当降低，以促使生长健壮的有效分蘖；如果达到高产千斤上下的地力水平时，应考虑到这方面。
      增产靠主穗还是靠分蘖
    关于产量依靠主穗还是分蘖问题，大家的认识是比较一致的。在亩产六百斤以下的麦田，大田单株分蘖一般为一点一到一点六之间，也就是一个主蘖只有零点一到零点六个分蘖，主穗率约占全部穗数60％—90％。在此水平只要肥力跟得上，增株增穗即可增产。因此产量系依靠主穗，要保证有足够的主穗数目。但是依靠主穗并不是只靠主穗，组成高产必须包括一部分分蘖穗。若分蘖穗不能形成，那一定是由于营养或光线不足所致，因而影响全株健全生长，产量不能提高。根据观察所得，要是冬前麦株能生长三——五个分蘖，永久根同样会生长良好；麦叶在入冬后匍匐如菊花瓣，来年就能形成若干分蘖穗，长成好麦子。反之，要是植株拥挤，幼苗上不形成分蘖，不发生永久根，生长将极不正常，总的成穗数低于植株数，产量将大为降低。但就目前大田水平来看，单株分蘖还不易越过一点六，分蘖穗终究在产量上占次要地位。在我国目前希望将全国平均麦产量自亩产不足二百斤提高到六百斤这一阶段，强调依靠主穗是主要的。在依靠主穗的同时，在栽培水平上还要争取分蘖穗比率的提高，产量才能不断增高，这是互为作用的辩证关系。
    在防止倒伏方面，除了肥水因素以外，苗期在过度拥挤光照不足时，麦茎节间细长，机械组织很不发达，表层细胞不能木质化，就能形成苗期倒伏。这时只有通过疏苗透光，才能改善倒伏情况。有的播种量在初期幼苗生长合适，但到拔节起身后仍嫌过密，以致形成出穗前后茎软倒伏减产。因此，确定播种量时，必须考虑到基本苗数、地力程度、分蘖数、成长后的植株密集阴蔽程度，才能使生长全期不倒伏而最后获致丰产。
    一般后期倒伏的麦田，多为肥力较高生长繁茂有可能获致高产的。北京农业大学部分同志提出了后期倒伏为丰产标志的说法。但是不少同志认为这种说法不够确切。固然，低产小麦不会倒伏，丰产田倒伏的可能性大，后者产量还可能超过前者，但倒伏终久为病象，发生了总会影响产量，只有在丰产的基础上充分克服了倒伏现象，使小麦丰产到底，才是我们追求的目的。
    总的来讲，今年京郊地区的播种密度已有相当一致的看法，但是还应注意的一点是许多麦田播种后出苗差，成株率低，一般在70％上下，有低到50％的，除了设法提高整地播种质量外，在暂时不可克服的情况下，就不能不按实际成株率来增加播种量，以免基本苗过少，达不到所要求的成穗数，此外，延庆地处关外，气候寒冷，也可适当多播一些。
          播种期和品种
    除此以外，还谈到播种期问题。植物研究所根据去年麦苗生长情况，认为京郊最适播期为9月15—23日；不少同志认为播期应与其他条件结合考虑。如在旱地，由于冬前生育较差，可以略为提早播种，灌溉地、肥地却可适当推迟，以免冬前过旺易受冻害。本地品种红芒白、齐头白品种抗寒力、冬性都强，可以适当早播。改良品种适种灌溉地，一般抗寒力较弱，尤其碧蚂一号为半冬性品种，不能播种过早，过早了不仅易受冻害，还易诱致锈病发生，但播种过晚，麦苗发育不足，势必形成减产，晚播了更不好。一般说来，在关内各区仍以“白露早、寒露迟、秋分种麦正当时”的农谚提法，最恰当。农业气象研究室的研究结果也证明了这点。延庆入冬较早则提早到白露播种较为合适。一般早播可以适当减少播种量，迟播的应适当增加。
    在品种方面，由于去年碧蚂一号的调入，表现生长良好，穗大粒饱，为农民所喜爱，争欲扩种。但考虑到此品种原产陕西武功，属半冬性，抗寒力不强，去冬北京绝对最低温度只为－18℃，较往年高2°—4℃，因此能安全越过冬天，在延庆低温达到－28℃时，即发生30％—60％的冻害。在北京的冬季气象条件下，碧蚂一号不是可靠的应用品种，目前灌溉地仍以应用农大183、农大90、华北187、早洋麦；旱地用1885、红芒白、齐头白等品种为好。碧蚂一号只可在少量的肥水地种植。
