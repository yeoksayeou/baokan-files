Properly Arrange Health Work in Basic-Level Units
　　Zhu Zihui
　　Basic-level units are very busy with many tasks. To ensure that production is not affected while also improving health work, these two tasks must be properly arranged. Otherwise, if one is focused on at the expense of the other, something will inevitably be lost.
　　Proper arrangement mainly refers to labor and time. What constitutes proper arrangement? According to the experience of some advanced health units, it is necessary to adapt to the circumstances, adapt to the time, and adapt to the people. For example, when rural production teams are engaged in a vigorous campaign to accumulate and create fertilizer, they should combine this with treating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, improving environmental sanitation, and repairing livestock pens and toilets; when factory workshops are repairing production equipment or cleaning up waste products, they should combine this with removing garbage, sweeping away dust, and tidying up the environment. These are all examples of adapting to the circumstances. Industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, schools, and streets should use Saturday afternoons or Sundays to carry out health shock campaigns; workshops should use shift change times to clean up work sites; rural production teams should use slack farming seasons, rainy days, and early mornings and evenings to mobilize the masses to carry out health work, as well as the "three takings advantage of" proposed by some regions (taking advantage of getting up ten minutes early to sweep the streets and courtyards, taking advantage of ten minutes before lunch to swat flies, taking advantage of wiping out mosquitos and catching rats before going to bed at night). This is adapting to the time. The health "seven packages" implemented by the Berlin Brigade, published in today's newspaper (cooks are responsible for the kitchen, storekeepers are responsible for the grain warehouse and farm tool room, keepers are responsible for the pig and cattle pens, manure managers are responsible for toilets and manure pits, students are responsible for canteen hygiene and fly catching, old people and women are responsible for households, and health personnel are responsible for health lessons and technical guidance), is adapting to the people. In summary, adapting to the circumstances means being good at integrating with production, adapting to the time means being good at using gaps in time, and adapting to the people means being good at dividing labor and using strength. As long as these methods are mastered, the contradiction between the health movement and production in terms of labor and time can be overcome.
　　To ensure that these methods are consistently implemented, some systems must also be established. For example, in environmental sanitation, establish a system of responsibility for sections and areas, a system of health supervision in public places, a system of epidemic reporting, and a system of regular inspection and evaluation. Through these systems, strengthen people's sense of responsibility, cultivate people's habits, and improve the quality of the movement.
　　Of course, the most important thing is to strengthen ideological education and organizational leadership. The health movement is a part of the cultural revolution, and the development process of the health movement is also the process of improving the health and cultural level of the broad masses. Promoting the health movement must not be done by coercion and command, but must be through propaganda and education to enlighten the masses' awareness. Therefore, it is not enough to rely solely on administrative arrangements, but it is necessary to continuously educate the masses in a planned way under the leadership of the basic-level Party organizations. Establish health organizations among the masses and strengthen the training of health activists, such as health workers, sanitation workers, and Red Cross members, to carry out various activities with them as the backbone. All basic-level units, workshops, production teams, streets, etc., should universally establish or improve mass health organizations, gradually expand the ranks of mass health activists, and strengthen the force for promoting the health movement.

　　妥善安排基层单位卫生工作
　　朱子会
    基层单位事情很忙，工作头绪很多。要不影响生产，又要把卫生工作搞好，必须对这两项工作作妥善的安排。否则，抓了这个，丢了那个，必有所失。
    所谓妥善安排，主要是指劳动力和时间而言。怎样才算安排得当呢？根据一些卫生先进单位的经验，就是要因事制宜、因时制宜和因人制宜。例如，农村生产队在大搞积肥造肥运动时，结合处理蚊蝇孳生地，改善环境卫生，修整畜圈厕所；工厂车间在维修生产设备或清理废品废料时，结合清除垃圾，打扫扬尘，整理环境卫生，都是一举两得，这就是因事制宜。工矿、企业、机关、学校、街道利用星期六下午或星期日开展卫生突击运动，车间利用交接班时清扫工作场地；农村生产队利用农事较闲时期、雨天和早晚发动群众搞卫生工作，以及目前有些地区提出的“三趁”（趁早起十分钟打扫街道和院落，趁午饭前十分钟打苍蝇，趁晚上睡觉前灭蚊捕鼠），这是因时制宜。今天本报发表的柏林大队所实行的卫生“七包”（炊事员包厨房，保管员包粮食仓库和农具室，饲养员包猪牛圈，粪管员包厕所粪坑，学生包食堂卫生和捕蝇，老人妇女包家庭，卫生人员包上卫生课和技术指导），就是因人制宜。概括起来，因事制宜就是要善于结合生产，因时制宜就是要善于利用空隙时间，因人制宜就是要善于分工使用力量。只要掌握这些办法，就可以克服卫生运动与生产在劳力和时间上的矛盾。
    要使这些办法经常贯彻执行，还必须建立一些制度。例如，在环境卫生方面建立分段分片负责制度，公共场所的卫生监督制度，疫情报告制度，以及定期检查和评比制度等等。通过这些制度，以加强人们的责任感，培养人们的习惯，提高运动的质量。
    当然，最要紧的还在加强思想教育和组织领导。卫生运动是文化革命的一部分，卫生运动的发展过程也就是广大群众卫生文化水平提高的过程。推进卫生运动绝不能强迫命令，而必须是通过宣传教育，启发群众的自觉性。因此，单靠行政布置的方式是不够的，必须在基层党组织的领导下，有计划地不断地对群众进行教育。在群众中建立卫生组织，加强培养卫生积极分子，如保健员、卫生员、红十字会员等，以他们为骨干开展各种活动。各个基层单位，车间、生产队、街道等等方面都应该普遍建立或健全群众卫生组织，逐渐扩大群众卫生积极分子的队伍，加强推动卫生运动的力量。
