Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 1st: A navigation exploration team dispatched by the Tibet Military Region recently confirmed that ships with a load capacity of ten to twenty tons can navigate from Lhasa along the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River to Tsedang, a major town in the Shannan area. After dredging some shoals on the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River, ships with a load capacity of one thousand to two thousand tons can pass unimpeded through this section of the river.

    The Tibet Military Region recently dispatched a small steamboat, which departed from Lhasa and sailed down the Lhasa River, entering the Yarlung Tsangpo River, Tibet's largest river, at Quxu, southwest of Lhasa. Here, it towed a large wooden boat with a load capacity of eight tons and successfully navigated to Tsedang. Subsequently, it returned upstream from Tsedang to Quxu.

    In the past, only a few yak-hide boats could travel on the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River during the high-water seasons of summer and autumn, and they could only drift downstream. Each time, after departing from Lhasa and arriving at Quxu and Tsedang, the yak-hide boats had to be dried and transported back to their original location by land. Yak-hide boats have a small carrying capacity, long travel times, and are very dangerous, which is far from meeting transportation needs. Transportation between Lhasa and Tsedang, in addition to a highway opened to traffic in 1957, still mainly relies on pack animals. The success of this exploration is of great significance for utilizing the water transport of the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River, facilitating transportation between the two resource-rich regions of Lhasa and Shannan, and promoting the exchange of goods.

    Currently, the navigation exploration team is designing steamboats and loaded wooden boats suitable for navigating on these two rivers, based on the data obtained from this exploration, and is preparing to manufacture them using local materials. Soon, convoys carrying three barges with a load capacity of forty to fifty tons will appear on the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Tsangpo River.

    拉萨泽当间将通航汽船
    据新华社拉萨1日电　西藏军区派出的一支探航队最近探明，载重十到二十吨的船只从拉萨可以沿拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江通航，到山南地区的重镇泽当。在拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江的一些浅滩经过整治以后，载重一千到二千吨的船只都可以在这一段河道中通行无阻。 
    西藏军区最近派出一艘小汽船，从拉萨出发，顺拉萨河而下，在拉萨西南的曲水进入西藏最大河流雅鲁藏布江，并在这里拖挂一只载重八吨的大木船，顺利地航行到了泽当。随即由泽当逆水返航至曲水。
    过去，拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江只在夏秋两季水多时，有少数牛皮船通行，而且只能顺流向下漂行，每次由拉萨出发到达曲水和泽当后，须将牛皮船晒干从陆路运回原地。牛皮船运量小，航行时间长，危险性大，远不能适应运输的需要。拉萨、泽当间的交通运输，除1957年通车的一条公路外，仍然主要依靠牲口驮运。这次探航的成功，对利用拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江的水运，便利物产丰富的拉萨和山南两个地区的交通，促进物资交流，有重要的意义。
    现在，探航队正根据这次探航中所获得的资料，设计适合在这两条江河上航行的汽船和载重木船，准备就地取材制造。不久，在拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江上，都将出现拖挂三个驳船载重四、五十吨的船队。
