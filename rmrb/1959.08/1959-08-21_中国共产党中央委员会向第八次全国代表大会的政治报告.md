An important symbol of a good Party member and a good leader is that he is familiar with the people's living and working conditions, cares about the people's sufferings, and understands the people's hearts; he adheres to the style of hard work and plain living, shares weal and woe with the people, can accept the criticism and supervision of the people, and does not put on any airs in front of the people; he consults with the masses when he has something to do, and the masses are willing to talk to him. As long as our Party is composed of such Party members, we will always have endless and invincible strength.

    一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；他坚持艰苦朴素的作风，同人民同甘苦共患难，能够接受人民的批评监督，不在人民面前摆任何架子；他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。只要我们的党是由这样的党员组成的，我们就永远有无穷无尽的、不可征服的力量。
