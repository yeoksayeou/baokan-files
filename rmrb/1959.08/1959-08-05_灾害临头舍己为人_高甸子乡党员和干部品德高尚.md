    Selfless Dedication in the Face of Disaster
    High Moral Character of Party Members and Cadres in Gaodianzi Township

    (Our report) Benxi, Liaoning Province—Communist Party members and basic-level cadres in Gaodianzi Township, Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, showed selfless dedication in the fight against the floods, saving more than two hundred lives and a large amount of grain and materials. Their noble communist spirit deeply moved the masses.

    On the evening of July 21, the township was suddenly hit by a heavy rainstorm, with rainfall reaching more than 200 millimeters in over a dozen hours. The township Party secretary, commune director, and all the cadres braved the torrential rain to mobilize the masses to rush to the rescue and protect the dikes. However, due to the heavy rain and rapid water flow, the reservoir dikes were quickly breached, and more than twenty villages in the township were flooded. The lives and property of the masses were under great threat. At this critical moment, the township Party committee immediately organized cadres and Party members to carry out rescue work. In the rescue process, every Party member and township cadre bravely stepped forward, rescuing more than 200 elderly, weak, women, and children from the one-meter-deep floodwaters in just over an hour. Some elderly and physically weak people were carried out of danger on the backs of township cadres and Party members. A water conservancy technician named Ren risked being swept away by the flood himself in order to rescue a farmer who was about to be swept away. While rescuing people, cadres and Party members also rescued a lot of grain and property for the masses. Many people forgot to rescue their own belongings. Their first thought was how to minimize losses for the collective and the masses. Some cadres, due to their selfless rescue of public property and assistance to others in rescuing materials, were left with only the two sets of clothes they were wearing after the flood. Zhu Ziyin, the leader of the Guchengzi Production Team and a Communist Party member, had all his family's belongings washed away and submerged in the flood in order to rescue more than fifty livestock of the production team. Liu Tingxi and Wang Zhonghai, the leaders of the Lianhua Production Team and Communist Party members, helped the team members rescue more than 1,500 jin of grain in the flood. Many cadres, without sleep or rest, immediately carried out condolences and relief work for the disaster victims. Wang Guodong, the first secretary of the township Party committee, and all the township cadres went to the affected villages to comfort them door-to-door, and within a day, helped more than 460 disaster-stricken families whose houses had collapsed to resettle, solved the problem of food for more than 1,000 commune members, and ensured that the disaster victims had food and shelter. An old man surnamed Xue in the Baimiaozi Production Team refused to leave despite several attempts by cadres to persuade him, in order to guard his submerged belongings. Later, the cadres were afraid that he would go hungry, so they carried lanterns to deliver food to him from more than half a kilometer away at night. The victims were extremely moved by the cadres' meticulous care and attention. They said that with Chairman Mao and the good cadres of the Communist Party, we can overcome any disaster; and they expressed that they must actively carry out production for self-relief and rebuild their homes.

    Zhang Zhengde, the vice governor of Liaoning Province, and Ma Ben, the secretary of the Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee, and other provincial and municipal leaders, who rushed to Suizhong overnight on the 22nd, praised the heroic behavior of the Party members and cadres of this township, who, in the face of extreme danger and cut off from contact with the higher Party committee, took the initiative, shared life and death with the people, and selflessly rescued the lives and property of the masses. They hoped that they would continue to lead the masses and thoroughly carry out production for self-relief in the disaster area.

    灾害临头舍己为人
    高甸子乡党员和干部品德高尚
    本报讯　辽宁省绥中县高甸子乡共产党员和基层干部在抗洪斗争中，舍己为人，抢救了二百多条人命和大量粮食、物资。他们这种高尚的共产主义精神，使群众深深感动。
    7月21日傍晚，该乡突然下了大暴雨，十几个小时内，雨量达二百多毫米。乡党委书记、公社社长和全体干部冒着倾盆大雨，动员群众抢险护堤。但是由于雨大水急，水库堤坝很快就被冲开了，全乡二十多个村庄都进了大水。群众生命财产受到极大威胁。在此千钧一发之际，乡党委立即组织干部和党员开展抢救工作。在抢救过程中，全乡党员和乡干部，个个奋勇向前，不到一个多小时，就把二百多名老弱妇幼从一米深的洪水中救了出来。有些年老体弱的人，乡干部和党员连背带抱地把他们抢出险境。有一个姓任的水利技术员，为了抢救一个将被洪水卷走的农民，险些自己被洪水冲走。在抢救人员的同时，干部和党员还为群众抢救出很多粮食和财物。许多人却忘记了抢救自己的东西。他们首先想到的是如何使集体和群众少受损失。有些干部，由于忘我地抢救公共财产和帮助别人抢救物资，洪水过后，自己只剩下了身上穿着的两件衣服。古城子生产队队长朱子印是个共产党员，他为了抢救生产队的五十多条牲畜，自己家东西全部被洪水冲走和淹没了。莲花生产队队长、共产党员刘廷喜和王忠海，在洪水中帮助队内社员抢出了一千五百多斤粮食。许多干部不眠不休，又马上对灾民进行慰问和救济。乡党委第一书记王国栋和全体乡干部，分头到各受灾村庄挨门逐户进行安慰，并在一天之内，帮助四百六十多户房倒屋塌的灾民安置了住处，解决了一千多名社员的吃饭问题，保证了灾民有吃有住。白庙子生产队有一个姓薛的老大爷，为了看守自己被淹没的东西，干部几次动员他都不肯离开，后来干部怕他饿着，晚上提着灯笼到一里地以外给他送饭。由于干部们对灾民无微不至的关怀和照顾，使受灾群众都极为感动。他们说，有了毛主席和共产党的好干部，天大灾害我们都能战胜它；并表示一定要积极进行生产自救、重建家园。
    22日连夜赶到绥中的辽宁省副省长张正德和锦州市委书记马奔等省、市领导人员，对这个乡的党员和干部在万分艰险、与上级党委断绝联系的情况下，积极主动，与民同生共死，舍己为人抢救群众生命财产的英雄行为加以表扬，希望他们再接再厉，继续领导群众，彻底搞好灾区的生产自救。
