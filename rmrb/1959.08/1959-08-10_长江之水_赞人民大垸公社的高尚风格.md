    The Water of the Yangtze River
    —Praising the Noble Style of the People's Dayuan Commune—
    Qiu Yang
    In the struggle against drought, what is most precious? Water. — No, there is something more precious than water. If you don't believe it, take a look at a brilliant thing that happened in Shishou County, Hubei Province.
    There is a People's Dayuan Commune in Shishou County, right on the banks of the Yangtze River. This spring, the commune used the collective strength of the entire commune to build a large water diversion gate at Jiaoziyuan. After the gate was opened, the Yangtze River water introduced every day could supply 70% of the commune's fields with self-flowing irrigation, ensuring a good harvest on 110,000 mu of land. Recently, the weather has been dry, and the evaporation of water has been fast and high. It is already good enough if the water introduced every day can be self-sufficient. However, seeing that the neighboring Pujji People's Commune in Jiangling County, the Wangqiao People's Commune in Jianli County, and the Dayuan Farm were short of water sources and facing greater difficulties in the struggle against drought. Comparing the conditions, the Dayuan People's Commune has much better drought resistance conditions than them. Therefore, the Dayuan People's Commune made a great and glorious decision: to support them! All cadres and commune members tried every means to save water. Under the unified leadership and overall arrangement of the commune, they ensured both a bumper harvest for the commune and saved water to support the brother counties and communes in fighting drought and providing emergency relief. In order to let the water flow quickly to the fields of the Wangqiao People's Commune, the commune members of the Nibatuo and other four management areas of the commune used more than 10,000 man-days to dredge ten long water channels. In order to ensure that the fields of the Pujji Commune could be irrigated, the commune members of the Yonghu and Xinyang production teams, which are located on higher terrain, happily dug open the water retaining dams so that the water flowed straight down; as a result, the fields that could have been irrigated by gravity flow could not be irrigated by gravity flow due to the lowering of the water level, so they used manual water carts to fight drought. In order to relieve the brother communes from the threat of drought as soon as possible, Liu Xinliang, the secretary of the General Branch of the Sunan Management Area, led the commune members to rush to block the water-retaining dam overnight. With the support of the Dayuan People's Commune, more than 90,000 mu of land in Wangqiao Commune, more than 40,000 mu of land in Dayuan Farm, and more than 14,000 mu of land in Pujji Commune, which were thirsty to death, were saved by the life-saving water. (According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th)
    When the life-saving water flowed from the channels of the Dayuan People's Commune to the long-drought-stricken fields of Jiangling and Jianli, was it just "H2O" flowing there? There are more gratifying and valuable things inside, that is, the communist spirit of cooperation poured out from the hearts of the members of the Dayuan People's Commune. They are worthy of being the people nurtured by the waters of the Yangtze River, with the same breadth and grandeur as the Yangtze River!
    In the old society, who could have imagined that in dry days someone would send a little bit of water to their fields? At that time, under the instigation and provocation of greedy landlords and rich peasants, this village and that village, the upstream and downstream often argued and even fought over water; the private ownership of the means of production made some people lose their humanity, and even brothers would be drawn into the whirlpool of disputes and become enemies. Even if sometimes an agreement on water use between upstream and downstream could be reached, it would take a lot of twists and turns and cost a heavy price. Now, those days of fighting over water and getting bloodied have passed like a nightmare. Today, under the threat of drought, people not only do not fight for water, but also actively send water; not only send the water they cannot use up, but also try every means to save water to send to others even when they are not well-off! The system in which the working people are masters of their own affairs has made people stand higher, and the collective ownership of the means of production has broadened people's horizons.
    What is particularly moving is the spirit of the Dayuan People's Commune of "leaving the difficulties to themselves and giving the convenience to others." For the sake of others, they spent a lot of manpower to repair canals and build embankments; for the sake of others, their self-flowing irrigation became water-wheel drought resistance; for the sake of others, they rushed to block the water-retaining dam overnight. They "worried about what others worried about" and exceeded their concern for their own interests. Of course, the brother units that received their support have already given them compensation for the labor they spent based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit; they also deeply expressed their gratitude for their spirit of cooperation. However, in their case, is it only because they want others to compensate and thank them that they do this? In order to jointly develop production, we must adhere to equivalent mutual benefit. However, here, the significance of things is obviously more than equivalent mutual benefit. Beyond "equivalence", people have created more value; above "mutual benefit", people have created higher interests. If we only understand "equivalent mutual benefit" from a static and passive point of view, and only see the existing value and existing interests in our eyes, it will limit people's vision and strength to a narrow circle. "Equivalent mutual benefit" illuminated by the light of cooperation and "equivalent mutual benefit" entangled in the ropes of selfishness are two very different things. Looking at equivalent mutual benefit with the latter perspective, it will be incompatible with the communist spirit; looking at equivalent mutual benefit with the former perspective, it will be consistent with the communist spirit. In the new society, in our harmonious and friendly big family, each People's Commune and each unit in the People's Commune are close brothers; for "others" is also for the whole; everyone is good, and the whole big family will prosper. Even if a commune achieves an unprecedented bumper harvest, in the whole country, the things produced are only a drop in the bucket. Only when the majority of communes and even every commune achieve a bumper harvest can our country be rich and the people's lives be better. It is conceivable that without the leadership of the Party, without the progress of the people of the whole society, and without the support of the state, could there be the Dayuan People's Commune? Could the Jiaoziyuan water diversion gate be built? It is also conceivable that if the Dayuan People's Commune encounters difficulties in the future, can the brother communes stand by and watch? Treating others with the spirit of cooperation, others will not only repay with equivalence, but also with the spirit of cooperation. The water of the Yangtze River is formed by the confluence of countless tributaries and small springs on both banks; it also irrigates the land on both banks through many channels and branch channels. The Yangtze River flows to the sea; the sea will rely on the help of the sun and the east wind to change into clouds and rain and send it to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
    May the spirit of cooperation bring more living water to the arid land like the Yangtze River! May the spirit of cooperation flow endlessly like the Yangtze River!

    长江之水
    ——赞人民大垸公社的高尚风格——
    秋阳
    在抗旱斗争中，什么东西最宝贵？水。——不，还有比水更宝贵的东西。如果不信，不妨看看湖北石首县出现的一件光彩夺目的事情。
    石首县有个人民大垸公社，就在长江边上。今年春天，这个公社运用全社的集体的力量，在蛟子渊建成了一座引水大闸。开闸以后，每天引进的江水，可以供应全社70％的田自流灌溉，可以使十一万亩田保收。近来天气干旱，水分蒸发既快又多，每天引进的水能够自给就算不错了。但是，眼看着邻近的江陵县普济人民公社、监利县汪桥人民公社和大垸农场水源缺乏，在同干旱作斗争中有更大的困难。比较一下，人民大垸公社抗旱的条件要比他们好得多。于是，人民大垸公社作了一个伟大的光荣的决定：支援他们！全体干部和社员，想尽一切办法节约用水；在公社统一领导、全面安排下，做到既能保证本社丰收，又能省出水来支援兄弟县、社抗旱救急。为了让水快快地流到汪桥人民公社的田地里去，这个公社泥巴陀等四个管理区的社员们，用了一万多个人工疏通了十条过水长渠。为了让普济公社的田地能够得到灌溉，地势较高的永护、新炀等生产队的社员们，愉快地挖开了拦水坝，使水直往下流；这样一来，本来可以自流灌溉的田地因水位降低而不能自流灌溉了，就用人力车水抗旱。为了使兄弟公社早些解除干旱的威胁，粟南管理区总支书记刘新良带领社员连夜抢堵拦水坝。在人民大垸公社的支援下，汪桥公社九万多亩、大垸农场四万多亩、普济公社一万四千多亩渴得要死的庄稼得到了救命水。（据新华社武汉7日电）
    当活命的水从人民大垸公社的渠道向江陵、监利的久旱的田地流去的时候，那里奔流着的，难道只是“氢二氧一”的水吗？里面有更令人欣喜、更值得珍贵的东西，那就是从人民大垸公社社员们心里倾泻而出的共产主义协作精神。他们不愧为长江的水哺育着的人民，有长江一样的胸怀和气派！
    在旧社会，有谁能想像在干旱的日子里会有人送给自己田地一点一滴的水？那时候，在贪婪的地主富农的主使、挑拨下，这村和那村、上游和下游常常为水发生争吵甚至械斗；生产资料私有制使一些人们失去人性，就是亲兄弟也会卷进纠纷的漩涡，成为冤家对头。即使有时上下游用水能够达成协议，那也不知要费多少周折，要付出多少沉重的代价。现在，那为争水而打得头破血流的日子已经像噩梦一样过去了。今天，在干旱威胁下，人们不但不争水，而且主动地送水；不但送自己用不完的水，而且在自己并不宽裕的情况下，千方百计地省出水来送给别人！劳动人民自己当家作主的制度使人们站得更高了，生产资料集体所有制使人们眼界更宽了。
    尤其令人感动的，是人民大垸公社那种“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”的精神。为了别人，他们支出了大量人工修渠筑堤；为了别人，他们的自流灌溉变成了车水抗旱；为了别人，他们连夜抢堵拦水坝。他们“急人之急”，超过了对自己利益的关心。当然，得到他们支援的兄弟单位对他们花费的人工，已经根据互助互利的原则给以补偿；对他们的协作精神也深深地表示感谢。可是，在他们，岂是只为了要别人补偿、要别人感谢才这样做的？为了共同发展生产，必须坚持等价互利。可是，在这里，事情的意义显然不止于等价互利。“等价”之外，人们创造了更多的价值；“互利”之上，人们创造了更高的利益。如果只是从静止的消极的意义上来理解“等价互利”，眼睛里只看到已有的价值、现存的利益，那就会把人们的视线和力量局限在狭小的圈子里。在协作的光芒照射下的“等价互利”和在自私的绳索纠缠中的“等价互利”是极不相同的两回事。用后一种眼光看等价互利，它和共产主义精神就会不相容；用前一种眼光看等价互利，它和共产主义精神就会一致起来。在新社会里，在我们这个团结和睦的大家庭里，各个人民公社、人民公社里的各单位都是亲弟兄；为“别人”，也就是为了整体；人人都好，整个大家庭才会繁荣昌盛。一个公社，即使取得了空前未有的大丰收，但在全国说来，生产出来的东西也只是九牛之一毛。多数公社以至个个公社都取得丰收，我们的国家才会富足，人民生活才会更好。可以设想：如果没有党的领导，没有整个社会人民的进步，没有国家的支持，能够有人民大垸公社吗？能够建成蛟子渊引水大闸吗？还可以设想：今后人民大垸公社如果碰到了困难，兄弟公社能够袖手旁观吗？以协作精神对待别人，别人不但会以等价报答，也必将以协作精神报答。长江的水是两岸无数支流、细泉汇合而成的；它又通过许多渠道、支渠灌溉了两岸的土地。长江大河奔向大海；大海又将靠着太阳和东风的帮助变云变雨，送到长江大河的上游。
    愿协作精神像长江大河一样带给干旱的土地更多的活水！愿协作精神像长江大河一样浩浩荡荡奔流不息！
