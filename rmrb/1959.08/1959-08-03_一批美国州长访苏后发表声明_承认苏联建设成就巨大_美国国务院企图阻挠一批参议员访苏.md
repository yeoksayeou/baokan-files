Xinhua News Agency, August 1st Dispatch from Washington via TASS: A group of American governors who recently visited the Soviet Union acknowledged that the Soviet people have made great achievements in building their country under their socialist system. The White House today released a statement issued by these governors.

In their statement, the governors said that during their three-week visit, they examined the Soviet Union's political, economic, and social structures, traveled to five republics, and spoke with hundreds of officials at all levels of government. The statement said: "We spoke with ordinary Soviet people and had the opportunity to gauge their personal sentiments and attitudes. As a result of this visit, and based on our own observations in the areas we visited, we have come to the following conclusions: It must be recognized that the Soviet people have made significant progress in developing their vast country under their socialist system."

These governors pointed out that they themselves remain supporters of the current form of government in the United States, but they went on to say: "We firmly believe that ways and means can and must be found to enable the people of these two great nations to better understand each other in order to seek lasting world peace. There is a very sincere friendship for Americans among the Soviet people."

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st Dispatch from New York via TASS: The American "Farmers Union Forum" reported that the U.S. State Department is attempting to obstruct a group of American senators and power station experts from visiting the Soviet Union.

The newspaper emphasized that "the American government does not want visitors to Russia to return and talk about Moscow surpassing the United States in hydroelectric power stations."
