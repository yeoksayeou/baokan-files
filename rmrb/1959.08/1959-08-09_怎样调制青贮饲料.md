Silage is a good way to preserve the nutrients in green fodder. After liberation, thanks to the attention of the Party and the government, key demonstration and promotion of silage fodder were carried out in Liaoning, Shanxi, and Hebei around 1950-1952. Since then, silage work, mainly using milk vetch in the south and corn stalks in the north, has greatly developed every year.

The Advantages of Silage

Fresh green fodder contains abundant vitamins and easily digestible proteins, fats, sugars, etc. After the autumn harvest, these nutrients are lost in large quantities due to moisture loss, sunlight, microorganisms, and mechanical action. Therefore, when using old methods to store feed, livestock often become weak during the winter. Silage is an effective measure to solve this problem. Through silage, the loss of nutrients in green fodder is reduced, and if properly prepared, the loss of total nutrients can be controlled within 10%. It is particularly effective in preserving various vitamins. For example, sweet potato vine silage contains 94.7 milligrams of carotene per kilogram of dry matter, which is basically close to the content of fresh sweet potato vines. However, air-dried sweet potato vines only contain 2.5 milligrams, a loss of over 95%.

The preparation of silage is not limited by climate and season, and it can regulate the contradiction between peak and slack seasons. For example, in the lake area of Hunan, there is a lot of rain in April and May. The cattle cabbage has been used up in the early stage, and the amaranth has not yet grown. Around 1957, this area used milk vetch silage to solve the problem of feed shortage.

Some weeds (such as straw) and potato seedlings have a certain odor when fresh, and their texture is hard, making them unpalatable to general livestock. Through silage fermentation, their texture and odor can be changed, thereby improving their feed value. Silage can also destroy the toxicity of some feeds containing hydrocyanic acid and improve feed quality.

The Role of Lactic Acid Bacteria in Silage

Most organisms in nature rely on the presence of oxygen to survive, but there is a type of bacteria that has the opposite habit. They must be in an environment without oxygen to reproduce well. In microbiology, they are called anaerobic bacteria, and lactic acid bacteria belong to this category. When the silage is sealed, the oxygen in the silo gradually decreases, and the lactic acid bacteria rapidly multiply and increase. Lactic acid bacteria use the sugar in the feed as nutrient and produce lactic acid through lactic acid fermentation. The accumulation of a large amount of lactic acid increases the acidity of the feed. Lactic acid is like adding a preservative, which can control the activity of spoilage bacteria, deformative bacteria, molds, etc. that cause feed spoilage.

Seventeen to twenty days after silage sealing is the process of lactic acid bacteria proliferation. Generally, when the accumulation of lactic acid reaches 1%-1.5% and the acidity decreases to a pH value below 4.2, most of the miscellaneous bacteria in the feed stop their activity. Eventually, the lactic acid bacteria also stop their activity with the continuous accumulation of lactic acid produced by themselves. According to Soviet scientific data, silage stored for ten years is almost completely sterile.

Conditions for Obtaining Good Silage

How to provide the necessary conditions for the reproduction of lactic acid is also the key to silage technology. Based on the above principles, these key points must be mastered when actually preparing silage:

1. Eliminate air (oxygen) in the silo and create an anaerobic state. In addition to trying to compact the silage as much as possible during the preparation process, the remaining oxygen in the silo mainly relies on the respiration of the cells of the chopped feed to be absorbed. As a result of cell respiration, the sugars in the feed are oxidized and decomposed into carbonic acid gas and water, while releasing a certain amount of heat, which increases the temperature in the silo. When the compaction is not tight and there is too much residual oxygen in the silo, the temperature often reaches about 60 degrees Celsius. The presence of too much oxygen will not only increase the temperature in the silo, but also promote the reproduction of miscellaneous bacteria, and also promote the loss of nutrients, such as the decomposition of sugars, the destruction of vitamins, the decomposition of amino acids, and the reduction of protein digestibility.

2. Master the appropriate moisture content. Shortly after sealing, the feed is the battlefield for the survival competition between lactic acid bacteria and miscellaneous bacteria (including anaerobic bacteria), and the quality of silage mainly depends on the result of this battle. It is generally believed that the most suitable moisture content for lactic acid bacteria to reproduce in silage is about 75%. If the moisture is insufficient, the silage is not easy to compact, the air is not easy to be discharged, and the temperature in the silo is easy to rise, which forms the so-called high-temperature silage. When the temperature tends to decrease, anaerobic butyric acid bacteria will use the remaining soluble carbohydrates to carry out butyric acid fermentation, producing volatile butyric acid and ammonia, which will bring a bad smell to the silage. If there is too much moisture, the original liquid juice in the silage is easily squeezed out, or the silage forms sticky lumps. In this case, butyric acid fermentation will also be caused.

The appropriate moisture content in silage is not constant and should be determined according to the texture of the raw materials. For example, corn stalks, Jerusalem artichoke stems and leaves are coarse and hard and not easy to compact, so the moisture content can be higher. If the texture of sweet potato vines, radish seedlings, etc. is soft, and the liquid juice in the plants is easily squeezed out after compaction, the moisture should not be too much.

3. Ensure that the silage contains a certain amount of sugar. The role of lactic acid bacteria in silage has been introduced above. The rapid formation of lactic acid is also one of the keys to improving and ensuring the quality of silage. The lactic acid in silage is mainly converted from the sugar in the raw materials. Therefore, the silage must contain a certain amount of sugar. Sunflowers, corn stalks, etc. all contain a considerable amount of sugar and are generally easy to silage. Potato seedlings and peanut seedlings contain less sugar and are not easy to silage alone. It is best to mix and store them with other gramineous forages.

    怎样调制青贮饲料
    中国农业科学院畜牧研究所
    青贮是保存青饲料养分的好办法。解放后，由于党和政府的重视，1950—1952年前后在辽宁、山西、河北各地进行了青贮饲料的重点示范推广。以后，南方以紫云英为主的，北方以玉米秸为主的青贮工作，每年都有很大发展。
    青贮饲料的优越性
    在新鲜的青绿饲料中含有丰富的维生素和易于消化的蛋白质、脂肪、醣类等，秋收后这些营养物质随着水分的丧失，阳光、微生物和机械的作用，引起大量的丢失。所以在沿用旧法贮备饲料的情况下，家畜在越冬时往往会逐渐瘦弱。青贮饲料是解决这一问题的有效措施。通过青贮，青绿饲料养分的损失较少，调制得当，总养分的损失可控制在10％以内。特别对各种维生素的保存是有效的，如甘薯藤青贮饲料每公斤干物质中含有胡萝卜素九四点七毫克，基本上近于新鲜甘薯藤的含量，但经风干后的甘薯藤中仅含二点五毫克，损失达95％以上。
    青贮饲料的调制不受气候季节的限制，并可以调节旺季与淡季的矛盾。如湖南滨湖地区4、5月间多雨，前期牛皮菜已用尽，而苋菜尚未长成，1957年前后这个地区利用紫云英青贮饲料，解决了青黄不接的问题。
    有些杂草（如藁草）和马铃薯秧等，在新鲜时有一定的臭味，质地也较硬，对一般家畜的适口性不佳，通过青贮醱酵可以改变其质地和气味，从而提高了其饲用价值。某些含氰氢酸的饲料通过青贮也可以破坏其毒力，改善饲料品质。
    乳酸菌在青贮中的作用
    在自然界的生物中大部分赖以氧气的存在而生存，但在细菌中却有一类与此习性恰恰相反，必须在没有氧气的条件下才能很好的繁殖，在微生物学上称为厌气性细菌，乳酸菌即属于这一类。当青贮饲料封埋后窖里的氧气逐渐减少，乳酸菌就迅速繁殖增加、乳酸菌以饲料中的糖分为养料，通过乳酸醱酵产生乳酸，大量乳酸的积累使饲料的酸度增加，乳酸犹如添加了一种防腐剂，它可以控制导致饲料变坏的腐败菌、变形菌、霉菌等的活动。
    青贮封埋后十七到二十天是乳酸菌增殖的过程，一般乳酸的积累量达1％—1.5％酸度，降低到酸碱值四点二以下时，饲料中的大部分杂菌停止活动，最终乳酸菌也随着自身所产生的乳酸的不断积累而停止活动。据苏联科学资料，在保藏十年的青贮饲料中，几乎完全是无菌状态。
    获得良好青贮饲料的条件
    如何为乳酸的繁殖提供必要的条件也正是青贮技术的关键所在，根据上述原理，在实际调制青贮饲料的时候，必须掌握这些要点：
    1、排除窖内空气（氧气），造成厌气状态。氧气的排除除了在调制过程中尽量踩压紧实外，残留在窖内的氧气主要依靠被铡碎饲料的细胞的呼吸作用所吸收。由于细胞呼吸作用的结果，饲料内的糖类被氧化而分解为碳酸气和水，同时放出一定量的热，使窖内温度增高。当踩压不紧，窖内残留氧气过多时，温度常常会达到摄氏六十度左右。过多的氧气存在不但会提高窖内温度，也能助长杂菌的繁殖，同时也会促成养分的损失，如糖分的分解，维生素的破坏，氨基酸的分解，以及蛋白质消化率的降低等。
    2、掌握适宜的水分含量。封埋后不久的饲料，是乳酸菌和杂菌（包括厌气性细菌在内）生存竞争的战场，青贮饲料的品质主要也取决于这场搏斗的结果。一般认为在青贮料中最适宜于乳酸菌繁殖的水分含量约为75％。水分不足，青贮料不易压紧，空气不易排出，窖内温度容易上升，这就形成所谓高温青贮。当温度转趋下降的过程中，厌气性的酪酸菌会利用剩余的可溶性碳水化合物进行酪酸醱酵，产生挥发性的酪酸及氨，会给青贮饲料带来恶臭。倘水分过多，青贮料中原有液汁容易被压挤流失，或使青贮料结成粘块，在这样的情形下同样也会引起酪酸醱酵。
    青贮料中水分的适当含量并非一成不变的，应当视原料的质地而定。如玉米秸、菊芋茎叶等质地粗硬不易压紧，水分含量就可以多一些。如甘薯藤、萝卜秧等质地柔软，一经踩压，植株内液汁容易挤出，水分就不宜过多。
    3、保证青贮料中含有一定量的糖分。上面已经介绍过青贮饲料中乳酸菌的作用。乳酸的迅速形成也是提高及保证青贮品质关键之一；青贮饲料中的乳酸主要由原料中的糖分转化而来。因此，青贮饲料中必须含有一定量的糖分。向日葵、玉米秸等都含有相当量的糖分，一般易于青贮；马铃薯秧、花生秧含糖量较少，不易单独青贮，最好和其他禾本科饲料混贮。
