Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 4th: A report from the "Kwang Lao Patriotic News" in Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, on July 27th states that the Lao Kingdom's Phoui Sananikone government continues to concentrate troops and conduct large-scale "sweeps" in many areas, further expanding the civil war.

The newspaper said that four American field-grade officers and other American military advisors were sent to the Lao Kingdom's Military Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in July to train and directly command the Lao Kingdom's army.

The newspaper also said that on July 18th, the Sananikone government concentrated a large number of troops in Xieng Khouang and repeatedly conducted "sweeps" in Indo, Bon Men, Bon Ro, Chan Chee, Muang Ngan, and Tham Da. The Kingdom's army robbed everywhere, raped women, and even raped pregnant women and women who had just given birth.

The report said that the people in the above-mentioned areas were forced to defend themselves, and together with the 2nd Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces, resisted the "sweeps," causing great losses to the Kingdom's army.

From July 18th to 21st, when the Sananikone army frantically conducted "sweeps" in Tham Tao, Tham Chai, Ba Beng, and Tham Phong, the local people's self-defense forces rose up to resist, killing three soldiers of the "sweep" army, wounding some others, and seizing one gun and some ammunition.

The newspaper said that on July 21st, the Sananikone government again mobilized troops to the Muang Phou area of ​​Sam Neua Province to conduct "sweeps," but under the heroic resistance of the people's self-defense forces, the "sweep" army was forced to retreat, leaving behind three bodies.

Currently, the Sananikone government is stepping up the mobilization of troops, preparing to launch larger-scale "sweeps" into many areas of Sam Neua Province. In Phongsaly, since May, the Sananikone government has continuously mobilized grassroots government personnel for training, preparing to more cruelly suppress the people. Recently, they have also strengthened the army, police, and secret service forces, surrounded villages, and wantonly arrested former resistance personnel, especially former Lao Fighting Forces personnel who have been demobilized in accordance with the Vientiane Agreement, and prohibited people from traveling, seriously disrupting the normal life of the people.

    人民自卫武装奋起抗击政府军进攻
    新华社河内4日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”7月27日报道，老挝王国培·萨纳尼空政府继续集中兵力，在许多地区进行大规模“扫荡”，进一步扩大内战。
    报纸说，四名美国校级军官和其他美国军事顾问，已经在7月间被派往老挝第一、二、三、四军区，训练和直接指挥老挝王国军队。
    报纸又说，7月18日，萨纳尼空政府在川圹集中了大批兵力，在印多、本门、本若、产椥、芒银、探达等地反复地“扫荡”。王国军队到处抢劫，奸淫妇女，甚至奸淫孕妇和产妇。
    消息说，上述地区的人民被迫自卫，他们同寮国战斗部队第二营一起抗击“扫荡”，使王国军队受到很大的损失。
    7月18到21日，萨纳尼空的军队在探套、探寨、巴奔、探奉等地疯狂“扫荡”时，当地人民的自卫武装奋起抵抗，结果打死了“扫荡”军士兵三名，打伤一些人，并且缴获了一支枪和一些弹药。
    报纸说，7月21日，萨纳尼空政府又调集军队到桑怒省芒坡地区
  “扫荡”，但是在人民自卫武装的英勇抗击下，“扫荡”军被迫撤退，留下了三具尸体。
    目前，萨纳尼空政府正在加紧调动军队，准备向桑怒省许多地区展开规模更大的“扫荡”。在丰沙里，从5月以来，萨纳尼空政府就不断调集基层政权人员进行训练，准备更加残酷地镇压人民。最近，他们还增强了军队、警察和特务的力量，包围村庄和大肆逮捕前抗战人员，特别是已经根据万象协议复员的前寮国战斗部队人员，并且禁止人民来往，严重地破坏了人民的正常生活。
