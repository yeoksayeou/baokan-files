    The Qingdao Ma腔 Opera Troupe gave its premiere performance of the new play "The Lantern Story" in Beijing.
    "The Lantern Story" depicts the redress of a wrongful conviction, reflecting the people's righteous struggle against the persecution by the feudal ruling class. While exposing the ugly images of County Magistrate Yu Guang'en, the wealthy Zhu Fenghao, and Zhu Erlang, the author also successfully portrays positive characters with distinct personalities such as Granny Wang, Zhou Shaotuo, Li Hongzhu, Chen Huazhang, and Zhao Hanqiu. Granny Wang, although a teahouse owner, fears no torture from Yu Guang'en and adheres to the truth; Zhou Shaotuo, as a doctor, acts bravely for a just cause, speaks out for the oppressed, and remains unyielding in his struggle even while imprisoned; Li Hongzhu, a housewife, and Chen Huazhang, a scholar, are both willing to sacrifice themselves for others in critical moments; County Magistrate Zhao Hanqiu, unafraid of powerful figures, conducts investigations and research, and impartially adjudicates the case, redressing the wrongful conviction. These brave, righteous, and wise characters are loved by the audience. All the actors performed seriously and conscientiously, making the performance compact and moving, truly "one play." "The Lantern Story" is a good play with a solid foundation.
    Like other Ma腔 operas, "The Lantern Story" is full of the local customs and flavor of Jiaodong. The music and singing are bold and unrestrained, able to express the emotions of the people of Jiaodong, and therefore possess the most distinct local characteristics.
    From the perspective of performance form, Ma腔 opera has undergone significant enrichment and development. Initially, the Ma腔 singing was simple, and the orchestra consisted of only a drum, a clapper, and a hand gong; now the singing is much richer, with not only allegro but also adagio, moderato, counter-melody, southern gong, lullaby..., such as the counter-melody sung in the night trial of "The Lantern Story," which is very novel, beautiful, and moving. The orchestra has added stringed instruments, plucked stringed instruments, and percussion instruments, greatly enhancing its expressive power.
    Some say that the Qingdao Ma腔 Opera Troupe's development in music has not been recognized by the audience in Zhucheng, the birthplace of Ma腔. I think this is understandable. For example, after Ping opera entered Beijing and Tianjin from Tangshan, there were significant changes in the music, and even greater changes after liberation; the southern Yue opera also had to change after taking root in the north, otherwise it would become detached from the masses and lag behind the times. Looking back, didn't Ping opera undergo a major change after the lotus drop entered the city? Therefore, it is natural for Ma腔 opera to undergo changes in music after entering Qingdao City from the Zhucheng area. From this point of view, it is impossible not to develop and change. First of all, it should be affirmed that this development is necessary, and whether the audience in the birthplace recognizes it should not be the only criterion. The problem lies in developing correctly. The musical development of Qingdao Ma腔 opera has not deviated from the overall framework and is developing on the original basis, although it is greatly influenced by Peking opera and Bangzi opera. Maintaining a unique style, being inclusive, and appropriately absorbing elements from other brotherly opera genres on one's own basis is a common law of development for all opera genres. If there are still some problems, it is that the development of some parts and some tunes is not coordinated enough with the basic tone of Ma腔, such as some singing methods in the male voices are completely the melody of Bangzi opera, and have not been connected and integrated with the original tunes. Of course, this phenomenon is inevitable in development, but attention should be paid to blending them together.
    There are also shortcomings in the screenwriting of "The Lantern Story," such as the first half of the play being somewhat loose and not concentrated enough, so the inner world of some characters is not deeply explored. If, after Liu Wenchuan's murder, the play immediately depicts Zhou Shaotuo seeing Zhu Erlang for medical treatment, Yu Guang'en changing to visit the sick, followed by a private visit, until the characters and events are all concentrated in the first court scene for depiction, wouldn't it be better? Deleting redundant scenes and plots and freeing up time to further portray the characters is a good way to refine the art.

    胶东之花
    薛恩厚
    青岛市茂腔剧团来京首演了新戏“花灯记”。
    “花灯记”描写了一件冤狱案得以昭雪，反映了人民群众对封建统治阶级进行了一场激烈的反迫害的正义斗争。作者对知县于广恩、豪绅朱奉高、朱二郎等丑恶形象揭露的同时，较好地塑造了王妈、周少陀、李红珠、陈华章、赵寒秋等具有不同性格的正面人物。王妈虽是一个开茶馆的妇女，在于广恩的酷刑面前无所畏惧，坚持了真理；周少陀身为医生，见义勇为，打抱不平，身累缧绁，仍斗争不屈；家庭妇女李红珠，秀才陈华章在严重关头都能舍己为人；县令赵寒秋不畏权势，调查研究，秉公断案昭雪冤狱，这些英勇、正义、智慧的人物受到了观众的热爱。全体演员作到了严肃认真，使演出紧凑动人，看去是“一台戏”。“花灯记”是一出有基础的好戏。
    “花灯记”也如茂腔的其它剧目一样，胶东风土人情味很浓厚。音乐唱腔粗犷豪放也能表现胶东人民的感情。因之也最具有鲜明的地方特色。
    从演出形式来看，茂腔戏已有了很大的丰富和发展。最初的茂腔唱腔简单，乐队仅是一鼓、一梆、一手锣；现在的唱腔丰富多了，不仅有快板而且有慢板、原板、反调、南锣、娃娃……，如“花灯记”夜审中唱的反调非常新颖优美动人。乐队方面增了弦乐、弹弦乐和打击乐，表现力大大增强了。
    有人说：青岛市茂腔剧团在音乐上的发展尚未被茂腔发源地诸城的观众所承认。我想这是可以理解的。如评剧由唐山进到北京、天津以后，音乐上有很大变化，解放以后变化更大；南方的越剧到北方扎根也得变化，否则会脱离群众、落后于时代。回溯评剧由莲花落进入城市以后不是也起了一个很大的变化吗？因此，茂腔由诸城一带进入青岛市以后音乐上起了变化是很自然的事。由此看来不发展、不变化是不行的。首先应肯定这种发展是必要的，至于发源地的观众承认与否不应作为唯一的标准。问题还在于要正确的发展。青岛市茂腔戏的音乐发展并没有离大格，是在原有基础上发展的，虽然它受京戏、梆子影响很大。保持独特风格，兼容并包，在自己的基础上适当地吸收兄弟剧种的东西是各剧种发展的一个共同规律。如果说还有些问题，那就是有的地方、有些腔调的发展与茂腔的基本调不够协调，如男声中有些唱法完全是梆子的旋律，没有和原有腔调衔接溶化起来。当然，这一现象是发展中不可避免的，但应注意把它揉合起来。
    “花灯记”在编剧方面也有不足之处，如前半部的戏尚嫌松散，不够集中，因而有些人物的内心境界挖掘的不够深。如果从刘文传遇害以后，紧接着就写周少陀为朱二郎看病，于广恩改为探病，下面就是私访，直到把人物和事件都集中在第一个大堂来描写是否更会好些。删掉多余的场子和情节，腾出时间来进一步刻划人物是使艺术精炼的一个好方法。
