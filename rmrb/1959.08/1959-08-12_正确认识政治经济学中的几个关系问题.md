    Correctly Understanding Several Relational Issues in Political Economy
　　Yu Mingren
    Currently, many comrades are studying political economy. In the process of studying, you will encounter the following series of relationship issues. This article only expresses some superficial opinions on my personal understanding of these issues.

                Laws and Policies

    Political economy studies economic laws, not economic policies. In the process of learning political economy, it is necessary to distinguish between economic laws and economic policies. Economic laws are the essence of economic phenomena and processes, the inherent, inevitable, and stable causal relationships and dependencies within these phenomena and processes. Although people can understand and utilize economic laws, they cannot create or eliminate them. Economic policies are different; policies are formulated by people. People can formulate them, and when circumstances change, they can revise or abolish them. Furthermore, because the specific conditions of one country and another, one period and another, are different, policies can differ even when doing the same thing. As for economic laws, regardless of the country or the period, as long as the same economic conditions exist, its effects are universal and stable.

    It is wrong to take economic policy as the object of political economy or to directly regard economic policy as an economic law. However, there is no denying that the study of economic policies helps to explore and clarify economic laws, especially the socialist part of political economy. Why? Because, first, political economy's research on production relations must consider the dialectical effect of the superstructure and the base. On the one hand, this can correctly evaluate the impact of the superstructure on economic development. On the other hand, the superstructure is determined by the economic base, and economic policy centrally reflects the economic interests and demands of the class that owns the means of production (which is politically the ruling class). These interests and demands are often consistent with the requirements of the economic laws specific to that society. Therefore, the study of economic policy also helps us explore and reveal objective economic laws. Second, the economic policies of socialist countries are, subjectively, always formulated to conform to objective economic laws; it guides people's economic practice in a planned way. The economic consequences of implementing economic policies can serve as an important indicator of whether the policies themselves meet the requirements of objective economic laws. Therefore, the study of economic policies and their consequences provides us with rich material for exploring and revealing objective economic laws.

    Under the socialist system, the economic policies formulated by the state are mostly correct, and the effects received are enormous and good. However, from the perspective of economic scientific research, we cannot assume that objective economic laws have been fully revealed. Usually, the formulation of economic policy is not based solely on the effect of one economic law, but on the effect of many economic laws, and takes into account various specific conditions. For example, a correct price policy does not set the price of each commodity to be exactly equal to its value; being exactly equal may not meet the requirements of the basic socialist economic law and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. Correct price policy, in addition to considering the value of the commodity, must also consider, for example, historical prices, the price ratios of various commodities, the supply and demand relationship of commodities, the purchasing power of residents, and other factors (including political factors). In this way, the price of some commodities is higher than the value, and the price of other commodities is lower than the value, but on the whole, the total price and total value of commodities are equal. Obviously, here, a correct price policy is not simply an objective economic law, nor does it only meet the requirements of one economic law. Therefore, it is completely wrong to simply regard economic policy (even correct policy) as an economic law.

              Theory and Practice

    Studying political economy requires linking it to practice. Linking theory to practice is the fundamental characteristic and requirement of Marxism. No revolutionary worker should study theory for the sake of studying theory, but rather to transform the subjective world and the objective world. Linking theory with practice in study lays the foundation for using theory to solve practical problems. Moreover, Marxist economic theory is abstracted and summarized from actual economic life. Only by linking it to practice can we feel close to the theory and understand it deeply, and truly learn and master the theory.

    However, economic theory and economic practice are, after all, different, just as economic laws and economic phenomena are different. Some people mistakenly equate practice with theory, believing that practice is theory, which is essentially a denial of theory and a denial of science, and is therefore wrong. There are also those who are overwhelmed by certain individual and temporary successes in economic work, and give it general theoretical significance without in-depth and careful analysis, which has nothing in common with the idea that theory comes from practice, and is not adopted by Marxists.

    In linking theory to practice, such problems often arise, namely that some theories and viewpoints are felt to be inconsistent with actual economic conditions, or cannot explain practical problems, thus affecting some people's learning enthusiasm, and even thinking that theory is useless. This needs to be clarified. The so-called "theory and practice are not in accordance" is nothing more than the following situations:

    One situation is that theory summarizes the essence of economic relations, while practice is only the appearance of economic relations. Appearances are directly felt by people, while the understanding of the essence requires a process of abstract thinking. When the essence and the phenomenon are inconsistent, people tend to easily believe in the phenomenon and ignore the essence of things. For example, take wages under the capitalist system and wages under the socialist system; on the surface, they seem to be no different. However, there is an essential difference between them; the former is the value of labor power, and the latter is the amount of currency paid by the state to laborers in accordance with the principle of distribution according to labor. We know that the value and difficulty of scientific theory lies in revealing the essence of things through phenomena. Therefore, in many cases, it is not that economic theory and economic practice are not in accordance, but rather that people have long been confused by economic phenomena, forming wrong views, and failing to recognize the essence of things. It is precisely because of the inconsistency between economic phenomena and economic essence that makes studying economic theory very necessary. Otherwise, as Marx said: "If the form of appearance and the essence of things were directly identical, all science would be superfluous." (Capital, Volume III, p. 1069)

    Another situation is that many problems in real economic life cannot usually be explained clearly by a single principle of economics. It requires many principles or the entire theory of economics, and combined with the specific situations and characteristics of various countries to be fully elucidated. For example, taking the economic accounting of socialist enterprises, we must understand it from the perspective of the role of the law of value, and especially from the requirements of the basic socialist economic law, the law of planned development of the national economy, the law of continuous improvement of labor productivity, and the law of distribution according to labor. Only in this way can we explain a series of problems in the management of socialist enterprises and avoid one-sided errors in economic work. Therefore, it is wrong to rely only on a little bit of theoretical knowledge learned and eagerly want to immediately explain complex economic problems, and then complain that theory is useless. We should study honestly, systematically, and comprehensively, and conduct long-term and painstaking research on the problems in order to receive fruitful results.

    The third situation is that due to the development and changes in real economic life, some originally correct views are now outdated, or the explanation of newly emerging things is not enough, and the theory should have new developments in the new situation. For example, regarding the issue of commodity production and the role of the law of value under the socialist system, the regularity of the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism, there have been many new developments in theory in recent years.

                Logic and History

    The research of political economy adopts an abstract method, a logical method, and this abstract logical method is in line with the development process of economic history. The logical development of economic categories is a reflection of the development process of historical reality. Therefore, studying political economy requires both mastering logical development and understanding the historical process.

    Do not be afraid of abstraction when studying political economy, and even less should you regard abstraction as being detached from reality and having a distant relationship with reality. In fact, on the contrary, scientific abstraction precisely grasps the most important and essential things in economic reality, so that we can more correctly and comprehensively grasp the complex economic reality, and thus be closer to reality. For example, the development from simple commodity production to capitalist commodity production is an extremely complex process in history. Marx used abstract logical methods to find the difference between the commodity circulation formula and the capital circulation formula, one is commodity-money-commodity, and the other is money-commodity-more money. From here, the transformation of money into capital is analyzed, revealing the formation of labor power as a special commodity and the secrets of capitalist exploitation. On the surface, this seemingly purely deductive and a priori form of logical development is detached from reality and unreliable. In fact, it is not the case. It is this logical development form that helps us firmly grasp reality and understand reality. Engels said: "History often advances with leaps and twists. If it is necessary to follow it everywhere, then not only must attention be paid to many unimportant materials, but also the thinking process must often be interrupted." The greatest advantage of the logical research method is that it "breaks away from the historical form and the chance events that cause disturbances."

    Since the logical process is only a reflection of the real historical process, when we study political economy, we cannot be satisfied with merely understanding the formulas of the logical development process, and only remembering a pile of formulas and concepts, like reciting various formulas in natural science. We need to understand the real historical background of the logical process. For example, when studying the development of the form of value, we must not only grasp the development from one form of value to another logically, but also understand the historical process of commodity exchange, how, due to the expansion of the social division of labor and the emergence of private ownership, the unfolding of the inherent contradictions of commodities caused the inevitable transition from one form of value to another and the inevitable emergence of money. Only in this way can we truly and firmly grasp the principles of the origin and essence of money. The same is true for the study of socialist economic theory. We cannot just remember a few socialist economic laws, but should understand the economic conditions under which these laws are generated, as well as their specific manifestations in the transition from capitalism to socialism, after the establishment of socialism, and in the transition to communism. Engels said: "Logical development does not have to be limited to the purely abstract realm. On the contrary, it needs historical examples and constant contact with reality." This is what he meant.

              Learning and Criticism

    In the process of learning political economy, on the one hand, we must learn the positive things, the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist political economy; on the other hand, we must also criticize the wrong things, and launch a struggle against bourgeois economic theories and various reactionary economic viewpoints. Only by combining the two can we learn political economy well.

    Which comes first, learning or criticism? Without mastering the basic principles of political economy, there will be no sharp weapon in hand. Criticizing reactionary and wrong things by relying solely on feelings and experience will appear weak and powerless. During the rectification and anti-rightist period, some comrades were very angry when they heard the rightists' fallacy that "fixed interest is not exploitation," and wanted to severely criticize it, but because they had not mastered the Marxist theory of surplus value and the theory of capital accumulation, as well as the principle of possibly implementing "redemption" of the bourgeoisie during the transition period, "one hates to have learned too little when putting it to use." During the criticism, they felt inadequate. Therefore, we must first learn the positive things before criticizing the negative things. Some people believe that since Marxism was born in the battle against reactionary doctrines, we must first understand various reactionary doctrines in our study, and then derive correct principles in the criticism. This opinion may not be appropriate. We should separate the creation process of political economy from our process of learning political economy today. Since Marxism has been proven to be the truth by countless revolutionary practices in history, we should first learn this truth, understand its basic spirit, and then gradually deepen our understanding in the process of continuous application (including the criticism of opposing viewpoints).

    Criticizing the negative things will help us consolidate and deepen our understanding of the positive things. So, what should be the focus of criticism? Since its birth, Marxist political economy has fought against its enemies, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, countless times. Do we, as learners of political economy, need to go through all the battles again in turn? Not necessarily. We should concentrate our efforts on criticizing the bourgeois economic theories that are popular and influential in society, as well as the relevant wrong ideas that exist in our own minds. As for some erroneous theories and viewpoints that are old and have little influence today, beginners can ignore them, except for those who specialize in political economy, the history of economic thought, and related subjects. Otherwise, it will be time-consuming and hinder the study and research of the main practical problems.

    正确认识政治经济学中的几个关系问题
　　俞明仁
    目前，许多同志都在学习政治经济学。在学习过程中，将会遇到以下的一系列的关系问题。本文仅就个人对这些问题的认识，发表一点粗浅的意见。
                规律和政策
    政治经济学是研究经济规律的，不是研究经济政策的。在学习政治经济学的过程中，必须区别经济规律和经济政策。经济规律，这是经济现象和经济过程的本质，是这些现象和过程的内部所固有的必然的、稳定的因果联系和依赖关系。人们尽管能够认识和利用经济规律，但却不能创造它、消灭它。经济政策则不同，政策是由人制订的；人们可以制订它，而当情况发生变化时，也就可以修正它、废止它。并且，由于这一国家和那一国家、这一时期和那一时期的具体条件不同，做同一件事，政策可以有所不同。至于经济规律，不管任何国家，任何时期，只要存在着同样的经济条件，它的作用就带有普遍性和稳定性。
    将经济政策作为政治经济学的对象，或者把经济政策直接当作经济规律来研究，都是错误的。但是，不容否认，对经济政策的研究却有助于对经济规律的探索和阐明，政治经济学的社会主义部分尤其如此。为什么呢？因为第一，政治经济学对生产关系的研究要考虑到上层建筑和基础的辩证作用，这一方面可以正确估价上层建筑对经济发展的影响，另方面，上层建筑是被经济基础决定的，经济政策集中表现了占有生产资料的阶级（它在政治上是统治阶级）的经济利益和要求，这种利益和要求常常是同该社会所特有的经济规律的要求相一致的。因此，对经济政策的研究，也有助于我们探索和揭明客观济经规律。第二，社会主义国家的经济政策，从主观上说，总是力求符合客观经济规律而制订的；它有计划地指导人们的经济实践。执行经济政策所产生的经济后果如何，可以成为验证政策本身是否符合客观经济规律要求的重要标志。因此，对经济政策及其执行后果的研究，会给我们探索和揭明客观经济规律提供丰富的资料。
    在社会主义制度下，国家制订的经济政策绝大多数是正确的，收到的效果是巨大的良好的。但是，从经济科学研究的角度来看，也不能以此就认为已经充分揭明客观经济规律了。通常，经济政策的制订并不仅仅是依据那一个经济规律的作用，而是依据了许多经济规律的作用，并且考虑到各种具体的条件，举例来说，正确的价格政策，并不是把每种商品的价格都规定得同它的价值完全相等，完全相等未必符合社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的要求。正确的价格政策除了考虑到商品的价值外，还要考虑到比如历史上的价格，各种商品的比价，商品的供求关系和居民的购买力状况，以及其他的因素（还包括政治因素在内）。这样，某些商品的价格高于价值，另一些商品的价格低于价值，而整个说来，商品的总价格和总价值是相等的。显然，这里正确的价格政策并不就是客观经济规律，也不只是符合某一个经济规律的要求。所以，简单地把经济政策（即便是正确的政策）看成是经济规律，这是十分错误的。
              理论和实际
    学习政治经济学要联系实际。理论联系实际，这是马克思主义的根本特点和要求。任何一个革命工作者，都不应该是为学习理论而学习理论，而是为改造主观世界和客观世界而学习理论。在学习中理论联系实际，也就是给运用理论解决实际问题奠定基础。并且，马克思主义经济理论是从实际经济生活中抽象和概括出来的，只有联系实际，才能对理论感到亲切并了解得深刻，才能真正学懂和掌握理论。
    但是，经济理论和经济实际毕竟是有区别的，就如经济规律和经济现象有区别一样。有人错误地将实际和理论等同起来，认为实际就是理论，这实质上是否定理论，否定科学，因而是错误的。也有人被经济工作中某些个别的、暂时的成功事例冲昏头脑，对它不加以深入细致的分析，就赋予一般的理论意义，这也同理论从实践中来毫无共同之处，是马克思主义者所不取的。
    在理论联系实际中常常会出现这样的问题，就是觉得某些理论、观点与实际经济情况并不符合，或者不能解释说明实际问题，于是也影响到某些人的学习情绪，甚至认为理论无用。这是需要说清楚的。所谓“理论与实际不合”，不外是下面几种情况：
    一种情况是，理论是概括经济关系的本质的，实际却只是经济关系的表象。表象是人们直接感触到的，对本质的认识却需要一个抽象思维的过程。当本质和现象不一致的时候，人们容易轻信现象而无视事物的本质。比如拿资本主义制度下的工资和社会主义制度下的工资来说，表面看来它们好像并没有什么两样；但是，它们之间存在着本质的区别，前者是劳动力的价值，后者是国家依据按劳分配原则付给劳动者的货币额。我们知道，科学理论的可贵之处也是困难之处，就在于透过现象将事物的本质揭露出来。所以在许多情况下，并不是经济理论和经济实际不符合，而是由于长期以来人们被经济现象所迷惑，形成了错误的看法，未能认识事物的本质的缘故。正因为经济现象和经济本质的不一致，才使得学习经济理论成为十分必要。否则，犹如马克思所说的：“如果现象形态和事物的实质是直接合而为一的，一切科学就都成为多余的了。”（资本论第三卷第1069页）
    另一种情况是，许多现实经济生活中的问题，通常都不是用某一条经济学上的原理就能解释清楚的，它需要许多条原理或全部经济学的理论，并且结合着各个国家许多具体的情况和特点才能予以充分的阐明。比如拿社会主义企业的经济核算来说，我们既要从价值规律的作用上去理解它，还特别要从社会主义基本经济规律、国民经济有计划发展规律、劳动生产率不断提高规律和按劳分配规律的要求上去理解它。这样才能说明社会主义企业经营管理上的一系列问题，避免经济工作中的片面性的错误。所以，不能只凭一点两点学得的理论知识，就急功近利地想立刻说明复杂的经济问题，否则就埋怨理论无用，这是不对的。应该老老实实，系统地全面地学习，并且对问题进行长期的刻苦的研究，才能收到丰硕的果实。
    第三种情况是，由于现实经济生活的发展变化，某些原来是正确的观点现在是陈旧了，或者对于新出现的事物的说明已是不够了，理论在新情况下应该有新的发展。比如，关于社会主义制度下的商品生产和价值规律的作用问题，由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡和从社会主义过渡到共产主义的规律性问题，最近几年来在理论上都有许多新的发展。
                逻辑和历史
    政治经济学的研究所采取的是抽象的方法，逻辑的方法，这种抽象的逻辑的方法是和经济历史的发展进程相切合的。经济范畴的逻辑发展，就是历史现实发展过程的反映。因此，学习政治经济学，既需要掌握逻辑的发展，同时也要明了历史的进程。
    学习政治经济学不要怕抽象，更不应把抽象看成脱离现实、看成同现实有遥远的距离。其实相反，科学的抽象正是抓住了经济现实中最重要最本质的东西，从而使我们能够更正确更全面地去把握繁复的经济现实，于是，也就更接近现实。比如，从简单商品生产到资本主义商品生产的发展，这在历史上是一个极其错综复杂的进程。马克思运用抽象的逻辑的方法，找出了商品流通公式和资本流通公式的区别，一个是商品——货币——商品，一个是货币——商品——更多的货币。从这里分析货币到资本的转化，揭明了劳动力这一特殊商品的形成和资本主义剥削的秘密。从表面上看来，这种好像是纯演绎的先验的逻辑发展形式，是脱离现实的和不可靠的。其实不然，正是这种逻辑发展形式帮助我们牢靠地把握现实和洞悉现实。恩格斯说：“历史常以跳跃和曲折前进，如果必须处处跟它，那就不仅必须注意到许多无关重要的材料，并且必须常常打断思维进程。”逻辑的研究方法的最大优点，就是它“摆脱了历史的形式以及起扰乱作用的偶然性。”
    既然逻辑进程不过是现实历史进程的反映，我们在学习政治经济学的时候，就不能仅仅以了解逻辑发展进程的公式为满足，满脑子只记得一堆公式和概念，像背诵自然科学中的各种公式一样。我们需要明了逻辑进程的真实的历史背景。比如，在学习价值形式的发展这一问题时，我们不仅要从逻辑上把握一种价值形式到另一种价值形式的发展，而且要明了商品交换的历史进程，怎样由于社会分工的扩大和私有制的产生，商品内在矛盾的展开引起了由一种价值形式到另一种价值形式的必然转变以及货币的必然产生。只有这样，才能真正巩固地掌握货币的起源和本质的原理。对社会主义经济理论的学习也是这样，不能光记取几条社会主义的经济规律，应该了解这些规律的产生的经济条件，以及它们在从资本主义向社会主义过渡时期、社会主义建成以后和向共产主义过渡中的作用的具体表现。恩格斯说：“逻辑的发展完全不必限于纯抽象的范围。相反，它需要历史的例证，需要与现实不断接触。”指的也就是这个意思。
              学习和批判
    在政治经济学的学习过程中，一方面要学习正面的东西，学习马克思列宁主义政治经济学的基本原理；另方面也要批判错误的东西，对资产阶级的经济学说和种种反动经济观点展开斗争。只有将二者结合起来，才能学好政治经济学。
    学习和批判孰先孰后呢？不掌握政治经济学的基本原理，手中就没有锐利的武器，单凭感觉和经验去批判反动的错误的东西，会显得软弱无力。在整风反右期间，有些同志听到右派分子“定息不是剥削”的谬论很生气，想狠狠地批判一番，但是由于没有掌握马克思主义的剩余价值理论和资本积累学说，以及在过渡时期中可能对资产阶级实行“赎买”的原理，“书到用时方恨少”，在批判时感到力不从心。因此，首先必须学习正面的东西，然后才去批判反面的东西。有人认为马克思主义既然是在同反动学说的战斗中诞生，我们在学习时也必须先了解各种各样的反动学说，然后在批判中得出正确的原理。这种意见未必是妥当的，应该将政治经济学的创立过程和我们今天学习政治经济学的过程分开。既然马克思主义在历史上已被无数次的革命实践证明是真理，就应该首先学习这个真理，了解它的基本精神，然后在不断应用（包括对反面观点的批判）的过程中逐渐使自己的认识深刻化。
    批判反面的东西会有助于我们巩固和加深对正面东西的理解。那么，批判的对象应该着重于什么呢？马克思主义政治经济学从它诞生之日起，对古今中外的论敌何止作过千百次的战斗，我们学习政治经济学的每个人，是否依次地对种种战斗都要重新经历一番呢？不必的，我们应集中力量批判社会上流行的和有影响的资产阶级经济学说，以及自己头脑中存在的有关错误思想。至于年代久远在今天无甚影响的一些错误学说和观点，除了专攻政治经济学、经济学说史及有关学科的人之外，初学者可以不必问津，否则旷日费时，会妨碍对主要的现实的问题的学习和研究。
