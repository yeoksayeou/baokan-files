Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd. In the drought resistance efforts, the Lanxi Commune in Yiyang County, Hunan, organized labor cooperation and mutual adjustment of water sources between large teams and production teams, fully demonstrating the superiority of the commune. Currently, out of more than 68,000 mu of drought-stricken mid-season and late-season rice fields in the commune, more than 66,000 mu have been irrigated. Of the 48,000 mu of late rice planned for transplanting, more than 41,000 mu have already been rushed into planting.

In July, the drought situation in this commune became increasingly serious. After investigation and analysis, the commune party committee believed that if cooperation and support were organized, the drought could be overcome; otherwise, 12,500 mu of late rice in the entire commune would not be able to be sown, and 9,000 mu of mid-season rice would suffer reduced production due to drought. To this end, the call for "cooperative support and joint drought resistance" was made to the major brigades and production teams. Responding to the call of the Party Committee, major brigades and production teams organized extensive cooperation and support throughout the commune based on the different degrees of drought and the principle of equivalent exchange.

In cooperative drought resistance, major brigades and production teams first made reasonable adjustments to labor. Among the seven major brigades in the commune, the drought situation in the Qianba and Shuangfengshu brigades was severe, requiring more labor. The Huaihua and Yangjiao brigades, where the drought was mild, organized dozens of cadres and hundreds of commune members to bring thirty-four waterwheels to support them. Production teams also supported each other between the major brigades. The fourth squad of the Heping production team of the Bazishao brigade had a distant water source and little labor. The fifteenth squad had a water pump but the drought situation was not serious. Xia Guanwu, the captain of this squad, automatically invited four commune members and brought a waterwheel to the fourth squad to assist in drought resistance. Some large teams also drew labor from the production teams with lighter drought conditions to form mobile drought resistance teams, going wherever the drought was severe to provide support.

Major brigades and production teams also saved water and adjusted water sources to each other, so that drought resistance achieved greater results. Thirty-two acres of fields in the second squad of the Huaihua brigade of the Huaihua brigade were cracked (cracked due to drought). It took three waterwheels to get the water up to the port, labor was tight, and rescue was not timely. The first squad of Huaihua brigade tried its best to save water and gave part of the water to the second squad, so that the thirty-two acres of fields were irrigated in time. The twenty-five larger pipes for drainage and irrigation in the entire commune generally broke the original irrigation area boundaries and expanded the irrigation area, so that 16,000 mu of fields in the entire commune that originally had difficulty in watering were watered. The production teams also solved the difficulties of raw materials and materials through cooperation, and timely added and repaired various water lifting tools.

Due to the close cooperation between the major brigades and production teams under the unified leadership of the commune, the commune members' determination to resist drought became more and more resolute. They want to overcome disasters and strive for a bumper harvest. At present, the drought resistance work of various teams is in full swing.

### 劳力协作  水源调剂  兰溪公社在抗旱中大显威力

    劳力协作  水源调剂
    兰溪公社在抗旱中大显威力
    新华社长沙3日电  湖南益阳县兰溪公社的大队与大队、生产队与生产队之间在抗旱中，组织劳力协作，互相调剂水源，充分显示了公社的优越性。现在全社六万八千多亩受旱的中稻和晚稻田，已有六万六千多亩得到了灌溉，计划插秧的四万八千亩晚稻，也已抢插了四万一千多亩。
    7月间，这个公社的旱情愈来愈严重，公社党委经过摸底分析后，认为如果组织协作支援，就能战胜旱灾；否则全公社将有一万二千五百亩晚稻播种不下，九千亩中稻要因旱减产。为此，向各大队、生产队提出了“协作支援、合力抗旱”的号召，各大队、生产队响应党委号召，根据旱情程度不同和等价交换的原则，在全社范围内组织了广泛的协作和支援。
    在协作抗旱中，各大队、生产队首先对劳力作了合理调整。全社七个大队中，千把垸、双枫树两个大队旱情严重，所需劳力多，槐花、羊角两个旱情轻的大队就组织了几十个干部和几百个社员带了三十四架水车来支援他们。各大队的生产队之间，也相互支援。八字哨大队和平生产队四小队，水源远，劳力少，十五小队有一部抽水机但旱情不严重，这个小队的队长夏冠吾，就自动地邀了四个社员，带一架水车到四小队协助抗旱。有的大队，还从旱情较轻的生产队抽调劳动力，组成抗旱机动队，哪里旱情重，就到哪里支援。
    各大队、生产队之间还节约用水，互相调剂水源，使抗旱取得更大效果。槐花大队槐花二小队三十二亩田开坼（因干旱龟裂）了，到港里车水要三架水车才能把水车上来，劳力紧张，抢救不及。槐花一小队便尽量节约用水，让出一部分水给二小队，使三十二亩田及时得到了灌溉。全公社二十五个较大的排水灌水用的管子，一般都打破了原来的灌区界限，扩大灌溉面积，使全公社原来浇水有困难的一万六千亩田都浇上了水。各生产队还通过协作，解决原料材料困难，及时添修了各种提水工具。
    由于各大队、生产队，在公社统一领导下亲密协作，社员们的抗旱斗志越来越坚决，他们要战胜灾害力争丰收。目前，各队的抗旱工作正在蓬勃展开。
