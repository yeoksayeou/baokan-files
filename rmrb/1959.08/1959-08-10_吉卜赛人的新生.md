    The New Life of the Gypsies
    By our correspondent Lin Hai
    There are many stories about the Gypsies (also known as Roma). This people, who have left their footprints in many countries, have been praised by poets for their love of freedom, and described by writers for their nomadic lives of wandering everywhere, but all this has been given a romantic legendary color. As long as people know a little about the history of the Gypsies and the pain and humiliation they have suffered for centuries, they will sympathize deeply with these homeless wanderers, and will not treat with disgust some of the habits they have maintained for a long time. The Gypsies are by no means not yearning for a stable and guaranteed life. They are forced to wander around as adults, and even make a living by various improper means. All this is the result of racial discrimination in class society. However, under the socialist system, the situation is different. Let us see the Gypsies in Czechoslovakia, who, with the help of the Czech Communist Party and all the working people, have become self-reliant workers. They have actively participated in Czechoslovakia's socialist construction and started a new life.
    There are about 150,000 Gypsies in Czechoslovakia. After liberation, 40% have completely settled down; 40% are in a semi-settled state, with certain residences, but still often go to various places to seek temporary work; and 20% still live a nomadic life, drifting around as adults. However, since the Czechoslovak National Assembly passed a resolution last year on properly solving the settlement of nomadic Gypsies, party organizations, people's committees, and government agencies at all levels have attached great importance to this work. They have actively solved the problems of work and housing for the Gypsies. This work has progressed very smoothly. So far, all nomadic and semi-nomadic Gypsies have settled down.
    A Worker's Family
    It has been a long-standing wish to see the new life of the Gypsies in socialist society. Not long ago, we had the opportunity to visit some Gypsies and spend a pleasant afternoon and evening with them.
    We first went to the home of a loading and unloading worker named Deou-di. This is a Gypsy family that has settled down for a long time. They live in the same building as the residents of Prague and live the same life. The hostess warmly received us. She told us that Deou-di was currently on his annual vacation at home, but unfortunately he happened to be out today. They have five children. This group of beautiful children with black hair and black eyes surrounded us, the strange visitors, without any timidity. The mother told us that the two older children were in school and were both Young Pioneers.
    At a glance, the hostess is a hardworking and simple woman. She talked to us about their past and present lives. She said that life now is too good compared to the past. In the past, we Gypsies couldn't find jobs, and even if we found jobs, we were not welcomed. But now, as long as we are willing to work, the state will arrange suitable positions for us. She told us that in recent years, many of her friends and relatives have successively found jobs, and with jobs, they naturally have a stable life. She said that in the past, our life was nothing but poverty. We were all dressed in rags as adults, and even the girls often couldn't even wear a pair of shoes, not to mention what we lived in. Perhaps she was aroused by her memories of the past, and she seemed a little sad; but when she talked about her current life, she immediately seemed very happy. She told us that now her husband earns more than 1,600 crowns (Czech currency) per month, and can also get 880 crowns per month for child support, a total income of 2,500 crowns. Although it is a family of seven, they live a very comfortable life. As we listened to the hostess's conversation, we looked around the furnishings of the family. They live in three rooms. In the room where we were talking, there was a radio, a sewing machine, and a very new washing machine. The bedroom was furnished with neat furniture, the bed was covered with white sheets, and an oil painting hung on the head of the bed. The hostess said that tomorrow we are going to buy a new bed, and all the houses will be repainted. It can be seen that the hostess is very satisfied with her current life.
    Deou-di's family not only has significant changes in their material life, but they also have a rich cultural life. They often go to the movies, the theater, or travel to the suburbs on weekends. The hostess pointed to the violin on the wall and told me that this was her husband's hobby. Then she asked her twelve-year-old son, Milek, to take out the recently purchased accordion and play for us. Milek is learning to play the accordion in his spare time, and the monthly tuition fee is 150 crowns.
    Milek skillfully played the accordion. He played a Gypsy song for us. This is a low tune, desolate and mournful, and it seems to tell the Gypsies' past pain and sorrow. I looked at the fingers that were playing lively on the keys, his bright eyes. I thought that although he was playing a sad tune, he would not understand the misfortune and pain his fathers had experienced, and that such a life in socialist Czechoslovakia was already over forever. Then, he played several Czechoslovak songs for us. His expression was so light and joyful that I couldn't forget it for a long time. This was not because he played particularly beautifully, but because I saw a new life of the Gypsies from here.
    The Nomadic Life is Over Forever
    After leaving Deou-di's home, we continued to advance towards Bika Village.
    In Bika Village, there are some Gypsies who have settled down not long ago. The family we visited, the old mother was already in her sixties, she has five sons and five daughters. Living with her now are five sons and one daughter, as well as a large group of grandchildren. Not long ago, this big family was still living a nomadic life, here today and there tomorrow. They had no profession and were unwilling to work. Although many Gypsies have ended that drifting life after liberation, like this family, there are still a small number of Gypsies who, due to the discrimination of the old society and the habits formed by years of nomadic life, lack sufficient trust in the new society, so they are reluctant to accept new lifestyles for a long time. But since the Czech Communist Party and the government strengthened their persuasion and education last year, they have also begun to live self-reliantly and joined the ranks of the working people. Now the five sons and one daughter-in-law of this family are working in nearby factories or transportation departments, and they no longer wander around.
    Since they have only settled down recently, this family still has obvious traces of nomadic life, and they don't seem to be fully accustomed to the new lifestyle. But in any case, they have begun to work, and they have begun to realize the warmth of socialist society. They all said, to be honest, the Czechs and Slovaks are the best to us. Their concern and care for us even exceeds that for their own people. The eldest son of the old mother told us that they all participate in the political study of the factory, and their children are all in nearby schools. In the past, Gypsies had no opportunity to study at all because of long-term wandering and social discrimination. After liberation, the government has held many special schools for adults, especially after settling down, children have the opportunity to go to school. Gypsy children work very hard and have good academic performance. When the mother talked about her children's academic performance, she was often filled with pride and joy.
    Since they have only settled down recently, the living conditions of this family are not too good, but in any case, it is much better than having only carriages and tents in the past. They have almost all added furniture and new clothes. At the same time, they told us that the government and the factory will soon give them new houses.
    During the conversation, the men of this family returned from work one after another. They all looked strong and healthy, and seemed very happy. To show their welcome to us, the whole family sang Gypsy songs. They used their mouths to sing the sounds of various instruments, and with the singing, they danced the Gypsy dance. First the eldest son danced, then the old mother and son danced face to face. Watching this old lady in her sixties dance so vigorously and happily, one can't help but be infected by their cheerful mood.
    Gypsies are all good at singing and dancing. In the past, when they were living a nomadic life, whenever the sun set, they set up tents in the forest, lit bonfires, and you would hear the wonderful and weeping songs played by the three-stringed lute, and they would vent their sorrows in singing and dancing. And today, they have started a new life, and their singing and dancing are full of such a lively and joyful rhythm. Indeed, the Gypsies living in socialist Czechoslovakia are undergoing a huge change. Under the shining of the Communist Party's brilliant national policy, they will be transformed into honest and cultured workers. In particular, their descendants will be trained to be new people who build socialism and communism. All this shattered the slanders of the Western ruling class about the Gypsies being low-energy and barbaric. Facts have proved that at present, there are many Gypsies in Czechoslovakia who have become excellent workers, model agricultural cooperative members, heroic soldiers, some have become doctors and scientists, and some have gloriously joined the ranks of the Communist Party. Today, in socialist countries, the fate of the Gypsies is closely linked with the beautiful life of socialism and the bright prospects of communism. (Attached picture)

    吉卜赛人的新生
    本报记者　林海
    关于吉卜赛人（也叫做茨冈人），有着许多流传的故事。这个在许多国家里都有着他们足迹的民族，诗人们歌颂过他们酷爱自由的性格，作家们描述过他们到处漂泊的流浪生涯，但这一切都带上了浪漫式的传奇色彩。人们只要稍稍了解一下吉卜赛人的历史，了解一下他们在多少世纪来所度过的痛苦和屈辱的生活，就会对这些无家无国的流浪者寄予深切的同情，就不会以憎恶的心情去对待他们那些保持很久的一些习惯。吉卜赛人，决不是不向往一种安定的有保证的生活，他们被迫地成年漂泊流浪，甚至以各种不正当的方法求生，这一切都是阶级社会中种族歧视的结果。然而，在社会主义制度下，情况就不同了。我们且看在捷克斯洛伐克的吉卜赛人，他们在捷共和全体劳动人民的帮助下，已经成为自食其力的劳动者，他们积极地参加了捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设事业，并且开始了崭新的生活。
    捷克斯洛伐克共有约十五万吉卜赛人，解放后，已有40％完全定居；40％处于半定居状态，他们有一定的住所，但是仍经常到各地去寻求临时性工作；还有20％仍然过着流浪生活，成年漂息不定。但自从去年捷克斯洛伐克国民议会通过了一项妥善解决流浪的吉卜赛人的定居问题的决议后，各级党组织、人民委员会和政府机关都十分重视这一工作，他们积极为吉卜赛人解决工作和住房问题，这一工作进行得很顺利，到目前为止，全部流浪和半流浪的吉卜赛人都已经定居下来。
    一个工人的家庭
    想去看看吉卜赛人在社会主义社会中的新生活是长久以来的愿望。不久前，我们有机会访问了一些吉卜赛人，和他们一道度过了一个愉快的下午和黄昏。
    我们首先去的是装卸工人德攸迪的家里，这是一家定居时间较久的吉卜赛人，他们和布拉格居民住在同一所楼房里，过着同样的生活。女主人殷勤地接待了我们，她告诉我们，这些日子德攸迪在家里正度着一年一度的休假，但可惜的是今天他正好出去了。他们有五个孩子，这一群黑头发黑眼睛的漂亮孩子围着我们这些陌生的来客，丝毫没有胆怯的样子。做母亲的告诉我们，两个大的孩子都在上学，而且都是少先队员了。
    一眼看得出，女主人是一个勤劳朴实的妇女，她和我们谈起他们过去和现在的生活。她说，和从前比起来，现在的生活已经太好了。过去我们茨冈人找不到工作，即使找到了工作也不受人欢迎。而现在，只要我们愿意工作，国家就会给我们安排合适的岗位。她告诉我们，近几年来，她的许多朋友亲戚都陆续地有了工作，有了工作自然也就随之有了安定的生活。她说，过去我们的生活除了贫穷还是贫穷，成年都穿得破破烂烂，就是姑娘也经常连一双鞋也穿不上，而住的是些什么就更不用说了。也许勾引起她对过去的回忆了，她显得有些哀伤；但当她谈到现在的生活时，她马上显得很愉快了。她告诉我们，现在她的丈夫每月有一千六百多克朗（捷币）工资，此外每月还能得到八百八十克朗的子女补助费，总共收入二千五百克朗，虽然是七口之家，但日子过得很宽裕。我们一面听女主人的谈话，一面环顾了这个家庭的陈设。他们住有三间房子，在我们谈话的这一间房子里有收音机、缝纫机，还有一架很新的洗衣机。卧室里摆着整齐的家具，床上铺着洁白的床单，床头上挂着一幅油画。女主人说，明天我们就要去买新床，所有的房子也将重新粉刷。看得出，女主人对今天的生活是很满意的。
    德攸迪这一家人不仅物质生活有了显著的变化，他们也有了丰富的文化生活。他们经常在周末去看电影、看戏或到郊外旅行。女主人指着墙上的小提琴告诉我，这是她丈夫的爱好。接着她要她十二岁的大儿子米列克拿出最近新买的手风琴为我们弹奏，米列克正在课余学习拉手风琴，每月的学费是一百五十克朗。
    米列克熟练地拉起了手风琴，他为我们拉了一支茨冈的歌曲，这是一首低沉的曲调，凄凉而哀怨，它似乎倾诉着吉卜赛人过去的痛苦和忧伤。我看着他在琴键上活泼地弹奏着的手指，他的明亮的眼睛，我想他虽然在拉一支悲哀的曲子，但他是不会理解他的父辈曾经经历过的不幸和痛苦的，而且那样的生活在社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克也已经是永远结束了。接着，他又为我们奏了几支捷克斯洛伐克歌子，他的神情是那样轻快、欢乐，以至使我久久不能忘怀，这不是因为他弹奏得特别美妙，而是从这里我看到了吉卜赛人的新生活。
    永远结束了流浪生涯
    从德攸迪家里出来，我们继续向碧卡村前进。
    在碧卡村里，有一些定居不久的吉卜赛人。我们访问的一家，老母亲已经六十多岁了，她有五个儿子和五个女儿。现在和她生活在一起的有五个儿子和一个女儿，还有一大群孙儿孙女。这一大家人在不久前还过着今天这里明天那方的流浪生活，他们没有职业也不愿劳动。虽然解放后，许多吉卜赛人都结束了那种漂息不定的生活，但是像这一家人一样，还有少数的吉卜赛人由于旧社会的歧视，由于长年流浪生活养成的习惯，他们对新社会还缺乏足够的信赖，所以久久不愿接受新的生活方式。但是自从去年捷共和政府加强了对他们的说服教育后，他们也都开始了自食其力的生活，加入到劳动人民的行列中来。现在这一家人的五个儿子和一个儿媳都在附近的工厂或运输部门工作，他们也已经不再四处流浪了。
    由于刚定居不久，这一家人身上还存着较明显的流浪生活的痕迹，似乎还没完全习惯新的生活方式。但无论如何，他们已开始了劳动，而且他们已开始意识到社会主义社会的温暖。他们都说，说真的，捷克人和斯洛伐克人对我们是再好不过的了，他们对我们的关心和照顾甚至超过对他们本族的人。老母亲的大儿子告诉我们，他们都参加工厂的政治学习，他们的孩子们也都在附近的学校里上学。过去吉卜赛人因为长期流浪和受社会的歧视，根本没有学习的机会。解放后，政府为成年人举办了许多专门的学校，特别是定居下来后，孩子们都有可能上学了。吉卜赛人的孩子很用功，学习成绩都很好。做母亲的谈到孩子们的学习成绩时，往往充满了骄傲和喜悦的神情。
    由于刚定居不久，这一家人居住的条件还不算太好，但无论怎样比过去只有马车和帐篷要好多了。他们差不多都添置了家具和新的衣饰。同时他们告诉我们，不久政府和工厂就将分给他们新的房子。
    在谈话中，这一家的男子们都陆续下班回来了，他们都长得健壮结实，看来都很愉快。为了表示对我们的欢迎，他们全家唱起了茨冈歌。他们用嘴唱出各种乐器的声音，而随着歌声，他们跳起了茨冈舞。先是大儿子跳，接着老母亲和儿子对舞起来。看着这位六十多岁的老太太跳得那么矫健，那么欢乐，真不能不为他们这种愉快的情绪所感染。
    吉卜赛人都是能歌善舞的。过去在他们度着流浪生活时，每当夕阳西下，他们在森林中搭起帐篷，烧起篝火，你就会听到三弦琴拉出的美妙的如泣如诉的歌曲，他们会在高歌和曼舞中消泄自己的忧怨。而今天，他们开始了新的生活，他们的歌声和舞蹈充满了如此明快欢乐的节奏。的确，生活在社会主义捷克斯洛克伐的吉卜赛人正在经历着一个巨大的变化，他们将在共产党光辉的民族政策的照耀下，被改造成为诚实的有文化教养的劳动者，特别是他们的后代，将被培养成建设社会主义和共产主义的新人。这一切粉碎了西方统治阶级关于吉卜赛人低能野蛮的诬蔑。事实证明，目前在捷克斯洛伐克有不少的吉卜赛人成为了优秀的工人，模范的农业合作社员，英勇的战士，有的人成了医生和科学家，还有一些人光荣地参加了共产党的队伍。今天，在社会主义国家里，吉卜赛人的命运已经和社会主义的美好生活以及共产主义的灿烂远景紧密地联在一起了。（附图片）
