　　Yuzhi River Irrigation Area Uses Existing Water to Irrigate the Most Land
    This newspaper Taiyuan, August 14th dispatch: The Yuzhi River Irrigation Area in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, recently created a provincial record for the most land irrigated per unit of flow (cubic meter per second of water) annually and per day. The Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department requires all localities to pay attention to this experience in the current drought resistance movement, and to expand the irrigated area by using existing water sources and existing equipment.
    The Yuzhi River is an ancient small clear water irrigation area with a flow of only 0.25 cubic meters per second. Before liberation, the canals in this irrigation area were in disrepair for many years, the quality of the field surface works was very low, the irrigation technology was backward, and the phenomenon of water waste was very serious. The benefit area was only 4,000 mu. After the implementation of democratic management after liberation, the irrigation system was reformed, and various projects were newly built and repaired. The irrigated area has increased year by year. Last year, a total of 80,000 mu of land were irrigated, equivalent to 99,690 mu per unit flow. This is three to five times more land irrigated with the same amount of water than in general clear water irrigation areas, creating a new record in Shanxi Province for the annual irrigation area per unit flow, and playing a huge role in ensuring a bumper harvest in the entire irrigation area.
    Since the spring of this year, with the further implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture after communization, the work of this irrigation area has been further developed. Up to now, a total of more than 73,000 mu of land have been irrigated, an increase of 70% over the same period last year. According to the statistics of eight months, a new record of 107,875 mu of land irrigated per unit flow per year has been created. After the start of the drought resistance and prevention movement, the recent period has seen an average of 2,341 mu of land irrigated per unit flow per day, creating the highest provincial record for daily irrigation per unit flow.
    The Yuzhi River Irrigation Area continuously improves the efficiency of water use. The first is to rationally arrange water use, irrigate continuously, and not let a drop of water run in vain. The irrigation area has a low groundwater level, a mild climate, and the cultivated land is double-cropped a year. Whether in winter or spring, the cultivated land needs water. When it rains, the water is diverted to high-lying land and sandy land, or the water is stored in reservoirs for use in times of drought; in winter, according to different soil qualities, the downstream is irrigated first, and then the upstream is irrigated. During the summer harvest and summer planting season, when water use is relatively concentrated, harvesting and irrigating are carried out simultaneously, so that irrigation is carried out continuously on rainy days, in winter, and every day. Second, the Water Conservancy Committee calculates the number of days of water needed according to the irrigation area, flow distance, and water demand of each benefiting commune management area, and specifically arranges rotational irrigation; it stipulates that 330 mu to 400 mu of land should be irrigated per day and night, and no water fee will be charged if the irrigation target is exceeded. At the same time, the commune management area is the unit, and a contracted irrigation team is organized, with fixed personnel to implement contracted irrigation, contracted repair, and contracted maintenance, combining benefits with repair and maintenance. Third, to adapt to the production plan of the commune, the Water Conservancy Committee vigorously mobilizes the masses to carry out field management in accordance with local conditions, creating conditions for expanding irrigation and rational use of water. Fourth, continue to carry out publicity on water conservation and water saving and more irrigation competitions in the entire irrigation area. Advanced units and advanced figures are commended and praised every month. The Water Conservancy Committee provides specific assistance to units with poor work, so that the work can be developed in an all-round way.

### 峪直河灌区用现有的水浇最多的地

　　峪直河灌区用现有的水浇最多的地
    本报太原14日电　山西省汾阳县峪直河灌区最近创造了一个流量（一秒公方的水量）全年浇地和一昼夜浇地的全省最高纪录。山西省水利部门要求各地在当前抗旱运动中重视这一经验，利用现有水源和现有设备，扩大灌溉面积。
    峪直河是一个仅有零点二五流量的古老小型清水灌区。解放以前，这个灌区渠道年久失修，田面工程质量很低，灌溉技术落后，浪费水的现象很严重，受益面积只有四千亩。解放后实行民主管理，改革灌溉制度，新建和整修了各种工程后，灌溉面积年年增长。去年共浇地八万亩次，折合一个流量浇地九万九千六百九十亩，比一般清水灌区用同等数量的水多浇地三倍到五倍，创造了山西省一个流量全年灌溉面积的新纪录，在保证全灌区农业大丰收中起了巨大作用。
    今年春季以来，随着公社化后农业“八字宪法”的进一步贯彻，这个灌区的工作又有了新的发展。到目前为止，总共已经浇地七万三千多亩次，比去年同时又提高了70％。按照八个月的统计，又创造了折合一个流量全年浇地十万七千八百七十五亩的新纪录。在抗旱防旱运动开始以后，最近一个时期折合一个流量平均一昼夜浇地二千三百四十一亩，又创造了一个流量日浇地的全省最高纪录。
    峪直河灌区不断地提高水的使用效益，首先是合理安排用水，不间断地灌溉，不让白跑一滴水。这个灌区的灌溉面积地下水位较低，气候温和，耕地一年双作，不论冬季、春季都有耕地需要水。下雨的时候把水调到高地和沙土地，或者利用蓄水池把水蓄起来，以供干旱时使用；冬季根据不同土质，先浇下游，后浇上游。到夏收、夏播用水比较集中的季节，采取边收割、边灌溉，做到了雨天、冬季、日日都不停浇。第二，水利委员会根据各受益公社管理区灌溉面积、流量远近和需水数量，计算好需水天数，具体安排轮流灌溉；规定每昼夜浇地三百三十亩到四百亩，超过浇地指标不收水费。同时以公社管理区为单位，组织了包浇队伍，固定专人，实行包浇包修包养护，把受益和整修、养护结合起来。第三，适应公社生产规划，水利委员会根据因地制宜的原则，大力发动群众，大搞园田化，为扩大浇地、合理用水创造了条件。第四，在全灌区持续开展爱水、节约用水的宣传和多浇地竞赛。月月评比表扬先进单位和先进人物。水利委员会对工作差的单位具体进行帮助，使工作全面发展。（杨义）
