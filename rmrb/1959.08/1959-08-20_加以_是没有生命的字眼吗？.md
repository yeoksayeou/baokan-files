A Discussion on Writing Style

　　Is "Jia Yi" a Lifeless Word?
　　Wang Xuezou

    The article “‘Jia Yi’, ‘Yu Yi’ and Others” written by Comrade Dong Ming on page 8 of the July 10th People’s Daily, criticized the common problem of overuse of words like “jia yi” and “yu yi,” which is of positive significance for improving writing style. However, I think some of the statements in the article are worth discussing.

    The article begins by saying: “There are some lifeless words that should be completely eliminated from our articles. Particularly striking is the word 'jia yi'…” Undoubtedly, the author regards "jia yi" as a lifeless word that should be completely eliminated. We believe that whether a word is alive or not depends on whether it has a function in language expression; and whether there is a better word that can replace it. The word "jia yi" is often used before the main verb in a topicalized sentence to indicate "applying an action to an object" and contains a meaning of emphasis. For example:
      "At this conference, it is necessary to summarize our main experiences in our work, including both successful and erroneous experiences, and *jia yi* to summarize them."
    If "jia yi" is removed from the sentence, the sentence not only loses the emphatic meaning of "applying an action to an object," but also sounds awkward. This is because it violates a rule of Chinese. This rule is: when using "ba" or "duiyu" to topicalize the object, auxiliary components are generally added before or after the main verb to supplement the meaning. A single verb is often not up to the task. In this regard, Comrade Dong Ming provides a method of restoring the object, and he cites an example: "'To *jia yi* eliminate the obstacles on the road ahead,' doesn't it mean 'To eliminate the obstacles on the road ahead'?" However, although the basic meanings of the two sentences are the same after restoring the object, there are obvious differences in their rhetorical color. The topicalized sentence with "jia yi" not only has the implication of emphasizing the object, but also has the implication of emphasizing the main verb. These rhetorical colors all disappear in the restored sentence. Furthermore, there are more complex reasons why some sentences topicalize the object before the main verb, in addition to emphasizing the object and the main verb. Consider the following example: "Now the Central Committee of our Party has made a decision, calling on our comrades to learn to apply the standpoints, viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism, seriously study Chinese history, study the Chinese economy, politics, military and culture, and *jia yi* conduct specific analysis of each problem based on detailed materials, and then draw theoretical conclusions." In this sentence, "duiyu mei yi wenti (for each problem)" follows from "research Chinese history, research Chinese economy, politics, military and culture". If "mei yi wenti (each problem)" is returned to after "analysis", saying: "Now the Central Committee of our Party has made a decision, calling on our comrades to learn to apply the standpoints, viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism, seriously study Chinese history, study the Chinese economy, politics, military and culture, specifically analyze each problem based on detailed materials, and then draw theoretical conclusions," then it will feel like the flow of the sentence is interrupted. This shows that "restoration" is not a good method that can be used everywhere. Then, can we retain the original topicalized sentence structure, but change the word before the main verb to another more appropriate word? From the above sentence, it seems that changing the wording is also not easy. From this, it can be seen that the word "jia yi" has a special function in language expression, and sometimes it is not easy to find a more appropriate word to replace it. Therefore, it should be admitted that it is still a living word. We must affirm its positive role when used correctly, and not easily pronounce its "death sentence," because doing so will be useless and harmful.

### “加以”是没有生命的字眼吗？

　　“加以”是没有生命的字眼吗？
　　王学作
    7月10日人民日报第8版东明同志写的“‘加以’‘予以’及其他”一文，对滥用“加以”“予以”等词语的通病提出了批评，这对改进文风是有积极意义的。不过文中有些提法，我认为值得商榷。
    文章开头说：“有一些没有生命的字眼，应当从我们文章里彻底消灭。特别触目的是“加以”这个字眼……”。无疑，作者是把“加以”看成是个没有生命，而且应该彻底消灭的字眼儿了。我们认为一个字眼儿有无生命，要看它在语言表达上有无作用；这个作用是否还有更好的字眼儿能代替它。“加以”这个字眼儿，常常用在提宾句的主要动词前边表示“施加动作于对象”的意思并含有强调的意味。例如：
      “在这次大会上，需要把我们工作中的主要经验，包括成功的经验和错误的经验，加以总结。”
    如果把句中的“加以”去掉，句子不但失去了“施加动作于对象”的强调意味，而且读起来很不上口。这是因为它违反了汉语的一条规律。这条规律是：用“把”“对于”提宾，主要动词的前边或者后边一般要加些辅助成分的补语意之不足。单个动词往往是力不胜任的。对此，东明同志提供了一个把宾语还原的办法，他举例说：“‘要把前进道路上的障碍加以消除’，意思不就是‘要消除前进道路上的障碍’么？”但是，宾语还原，前后两句话的基本意思虽然一样，但其修辞色彩却有明显的区别。带“加以”的提宾句不但有强调宾语的意味，而且有强调主要动词的意味，这些修辞色彩在还原后的句子里全部消失了。再说，有些句子之所以把宾语提到主要动词前边，除了强调宾语和主要动词外，还有更复杂的原因，请看下例：“现在我们党的中央做了决定，号召我们的同志学会应用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，认真地研究中国的历史，研究中国的经济、政治、军事和文化，对每一问题要根据详细的材料加以具体的分析，然后引出理论性的结论来。”这句话里，“对每一问题”是顺承“研究中国的历史、研究中国的经济、政治、军事和文化”说下来的，如果把“每一问题”退还到
  “分析”的后边，说成：“现在我们党的中央做了决定，号召我们的同志学会应用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，认真地研究中国的历史，研究中国的经济、政治、军事和文化，根据详细的材料具体地分析每一问题，然后引出理论性的结论来。”读起来就有文气中断之感。这说明，“还原”也不是到处可用的好办法。那么，我们能不能保留原来的提宾句式，而在主要动词之前改用个其他的更恰当的字眼儿呢？从上面的句子看来，改换字面也是不易的。由此可见，“加以”这个字眼儿在语言表达上有其特殊的作用，而这个作用有时候不容易找到一个更恰当的字眼儿来代替它。因此，应该承认，它还是个有生命的字眼儿。要肯定它正确运用时的积极作用，不要轻易宣判它的“死刑”，因为那样作将是无益而有害的。
