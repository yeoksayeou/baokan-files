　　The Brazilian People's Struggle to Defend Oil Resources
    In Brazil, the struggle to defend oil resources is very intense. Oil nationalization has been seen as a symbol of national independence.
    Brazil has very rich oil reserves. Exploration has proven that the oil fields along the Amazon River in Brazil are among the richest in the world. However, because the oil fields were discovered relatively late, and there is a lack of funds and machinery and equipment for exploiting oil, Brazil's oil production is not high. In addition, Brazil is a country lacking coal, and its oil consumption is very large. It has to import oil and oil products at a cost of 200 to 300 million U.S. dollars every year, which allows U.S. monopoly capital to influence and control Brazil's economic life through oil supply.
    For nearly 20 years, the Brazilian people have been opposing U.S. meddling in Brazil's oil resources. As early as 1947, the Brazilian people launched a nationwide movement to defend oil resources to oppose the Dutra government's selling of the rights to explore, exploit, and process oil to the U.S. "Mobil Oil Company." Under the pressure of the powerful people's defense of oil resources, the Brazilian Congress passed a law in October 1953, stipulating that the exploration, exploitation, transportation, and sales of oil should be under the unified leadership of the state-led "Brazilian Petroleum Corporation." At least 51% of the shares of the "Brazilian Petroleum Corporation" should be held by the government, and the other 49% could belong to Brazilian companies or individuals.
    The "Brazilian Petroleum Corporation" has achieved great success in less than five years. Crude oil production has increased from one million barrels in 1954 to nineteen million barrels in 1958. In 1958 alone, Brazil saved 122.2 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange expenditures on imported oil and oil products.
    U.S. imperialism has not only not given up, but has also intensified its conspiracy to plunder Brazil's oil. Last year, Dulles' "visit" to Brazil blatantly coerced Brazil, demanding that Brazil transfer oil mining rights to the United States as a condition for loans. However, Dulles' threats and inducements failed. This year, the United States, taking advantage of Brazil's domestic economic difficulties, attempted to force Brazil to abandon its monopoly on oil through loans from the "International Monetary Fund." As a result, due to the strong opposition of the Brazilian people, the Brazilian government stopped loan negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund."

　　巴西人民保卫石油资源的斗争
    在巴西，保卫石油资源的斗争十分激烈。石油国有化已被看成是民族独立的象征。
    巴西的石油蕴藏量十分丰富，勘探证明，巴西亚马孙河沿岸的油田是世界上最丰富的油田之一。但是，由于油田发现较迟，又缺乏资金和开采石油的机器和设备，巴西的石油开采量不多，加以巴西是个缺煤的国家，石油消费量很大，每年要以二至三亿美元来进口石油和石油产品，这就使美国垄断资本可以通过石油供应来影响和控制巴西的经济生活。
    近二十年来，巴西人民一直反对美国染指巴西石油资源。早在1947年，巴西人民为了反对杜特拉政府把石油的勘探、开采、加工的权利出卖给美国“美孚油公司”，曾掀起一个保卫石油资源的全民运动。在强大的人民保卫石油资源的压力下，巴西国会于1953年10月通过一项法律，规定石油的勘探、开采、运输和销售统归国家领导的“巴西石油公司”经营，“巴西石油公司”的股票至少应有51％归政府掌握，其它49％可以属于巴西的公司或个人。
    “巴西石油公司”在不到五年的时期内，已取得了很大的成就。原油产量已由1954年的一百万桶，增加到1958年的一千九百万桶。仅1958年一年，巴西在进口石油和石油产品的外汇开支上就节省了一亿二千二百万美元。
    美帝国主义不仅没有放弃，而且加紧了掠夺巴西石油的阴谋活动。去年，杜勒斯“访问”巴西时就露骨地要挟巴西，要求巴西把石油开采权转让给美国，作为贷款条件。但杜勒斯的威胁利诱未能得逞，今年，美国又乘巴西国内经济困难，企图通过“国际货币基金组织”的贷款，迫使巴西放弃对石油的垄断，结果也由于巴西人民的强烈反对，巴西政府停止了同“国际货币基金组织”的贷款谈判。
