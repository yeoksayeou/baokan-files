Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 12th: It was announced here today that Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent telegrams on August 8th to Indonesian President Sukarno, Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk, and Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win respectively, regarding the current grave situation in Laos.

In these three telegrams, which had the same content, Pham Van Dong hoped that the leaders and governments of these three countries, in their capacity as Southeast Asian nations, would use their influence to help ease the tense situation in Laos. First, to facilitate the early resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos, to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and to safeguard lasting peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The telegrams pointed out that the direct cause of the current tense situation in Laos is the interference of US imperialism. US imperialism is attempting to turn Laos into its military base, to drag Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and is preparing to launch a war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The telegrams said: As early as 1954, US imperialism began to do everything possible to undermine the Geneva Agreements on Laos, attempting to lure the Kingdom of Laos into the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc. Especially after Sananikone came to power, under the instigation of US imperialism, the Royal Lao Government announced that it did not recognize the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

The telegrams condemned US imperialism for importing weapons and military personnel into Laos, and for building many new military bases in Laos; and pointed out that US imperialism also incited the Sananikone government to provoke the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, infringing on Vietnam's territory and airspace.

The telegrams said that the Sananikone government also colluded with the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, frequently provoking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Sananikone government also allowed former South Vietnamese puppet troops, such as traitors Dieu Van Long and Lu Qin Shi, to enter Laos to help them establish troops in areas close to the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The telegrams said that the Lao government signed bilateral agreements separately with the South Vietnamese authorities and the Thai government. These agreements are clearly of a military nature. The Franco-Lao joint communiqué signed by the Sananikone government on July 24th also openly stated that the United States should be allowed to import military advisors and weapons into Laos. The Sananikone government also used the "anti-communist" banner to implement a policy of terror, wantonly slaughtering, detaining, and persecuting former Pathet Lao cadres and other patriots.

The telegrams said that recently, the Sananikone government, using the civil war they launched as an excuse, has increased troop concentrations in the Lao-Vietnamese border area, including American military advisors.

The telegrams said that the above-mentioned actions of US imperialism and the Sananikone government seriously violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos, directly and seriously threatened the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and also threatened peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The telegrams demanded that the above-mentioned crimes of US imperialism and the Sananikone government be stopped immediately.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 11th: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front today issued a statement on the current situation in Laos, strongly condemning US imperialism and the Sananikone government for violating the Geneva Agreements, expanding the civil war in Laos, persecuting leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, importing a large number of American military personnel and military supplies into Laos, and provoking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement said, "The Vietnamese people are extremely angry at the above-mentioned conspiracies and crimes of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government."

The statement said, "Their conspiracies and crimes have forced the Pathet Lao forces and the Lao people to rise up in heroic self-defense battles to oppose the conspiracy to turn Laos into a US military base and colony."

The statement said, "The Vietnamese people demand an immediate end to US imperialist interference in Laos, and demand that the Phoui Sananikone government immediately stop the civil war in Laos and all provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, restore freedom to Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, as well as all Lao patriots. The International Commission for Laos must immediately resume its activities, and US imperialism and the Royal Lao Government must respect the Geneva Agreements on Laos, which must be thoroughly implemented."

The statement said, "The Vietnamese people have always hoped to establish peaceful and friendly relations with all countries in the world and neighboring countries (including the Kingdom of Laos), but the Vietnamese people can never turn a blind eye to the US imperialist conspiracy to invade Laos and threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The statement concluded, "The Vietnamese people fully support the Lao Patriotic Front's letter to the Lao people of August 2, 1959, and firmly believe that the Lao people will achieve final victory."

　　范文同致电苏加诺、西哈努克和奈温
　　吁请采取措施缓和老挝局势
　　越祖国战线发表声明支持老挝人民斗争
    新华社河内12日电　此间今天公布了越南民主共和国总理范文同8月8日就老挝当前严重局势分别打给印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺、柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克和缅甸联邦总理奈温的电报。
    范文同在这三份内容相同的电报中希望这三个国家的领袖和政府以他们作为东南亚的一个国家的地位，运用他们的影响，来帮助缓和老挝的紧张局势。首先，是促使老挝国际委员会早日恢复活动，以保障关于老挝的日内瓦协议获得严格的履行、保障印度支那和东南亚的持久和平。
    电报指出，造成老挝当前紧张局势的直接根源是美帝国主义的干涉。美帝国主义企图把老挝变成它的军事基地，把老挝拉进侵略性的东南亚条约集团，并且准备在印度支那和东南亚发动战争。
    电报说：美帝国主义早在1954年就开始千方百计地破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议，企图拉拢老挝王国加入东南亚军事侵略集团。特别是在萨纳尼空执政以后，在美帝国主义的挑唆下，老挝王国政府宣布了不承认关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    电报谴责了美帝国主义向老挝输入武器和军事人员以及在老挝新建许多军事基地；并且指出，美帝国主义还唆使萨纳尼空政府向越南民主共和国边境挑衅，侵犯越南的领土和领空。
    电报说，萨纳尼空政府还同南越吴庭艳当局勾结，经常向越南民主共和国挑衅。萨纳尼空政府还让前南越伪军刁文龙、芦钦诗等卖国贼进入老挝，帮助他们在靠近越南民主共和国边界的地区建立军队。
    电报说，老挝政府分别同南越当局和泰国政府签订了双边协定。这些协定都具有明显的军事性质。萨纳尼空政府7月24日同法国签订的法老联合公报还公开说要让美国把军事顾问和武器输入老挝。萨纳尼空政府还用“反共”招牌，推行恐怖政策，大肆屠杀、拘禁和迫害前寮国战斗部队干部和其他爱国者。
    电报说，最近，萨纳尼空政府以他们所发动的内战作借口，在老、越边境地区增集兵力，其中有美国军事顾问。
    电报说，美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府的上述行动严重地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议，直接和严重地威胁到越南民主共和国的安全，也威胁到印度支那和东南亚的和平。电报要求立即制止美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府的上述罪行。
    新华社河内11日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会今天就老挝当前局势发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府违反日内瓦协议、扩大老挝内战、迫害老挝爱国战线党领导人、输入老挝大量的美国军事人员和军事物资以及向越南民主共和国挑衅等罪行。
    声明说，“越南人民对美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府的上述阴谋和罪行感到非常愤怒”。
    声明说，“他们的阴谋和罪行迫使寮国战斗部队和老挝人民起来进行英勇的自卫战斗，以反对把老挝变成美国的军事基地和殖民地的阴谋”。
    声明说，“越南人民要求立即停止美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，要求培·萨纳尼空政府立即停止老挝的内战和对越南民主共和国的一切挑衅行为、恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人以及老挝一切爱国者的自由。老挝国际委员会必须立即恢复活动，美帝国主义和老挝王国政府必须尊重关于老挝的日内瓦协议，这个协议必须获得彻底的履行”。
    声明说，“越南人民一向希望同世界各国和邻国（其中包括老挝王国）建立和平和友好的关系，但是，越南人民绝不能对美帝国主义侵略老挝、威胁越南民主共和国的安全的阴谋置若罔闻”。
    声明最后说，“越南人民完全支持老挝爱国战线党在1959年8月2日发表的告老挝全国人民书，并且坚信老挝人民一定会取得最后胜利。”
