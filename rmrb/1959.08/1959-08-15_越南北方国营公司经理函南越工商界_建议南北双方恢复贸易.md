Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 13th. Managers of North Vietnamese state-owned department stores, cotton yarn and cloth, food, and medicine companies jointly wrote a letter on the 11th to the South Vietnamese Bureau of Commerce and South Vietnamese industrialists and businessmen, suggesting the resumption of normal commercial exchanges between the North and South.

The letter stated that North and South Vietnam should exchange goods and supply each other's needs. The letter said that in the past, North Vietnamese trade departments had made the above suggestions many times, but had not received a response from the South Vietnamese authorities.

The letter condemned the economic aggression of American imperialism against South Vietnam and the enslavement of South Vietnam through American "aid," which made South Vietnam's economy even more difficult. The letter said: The South Vietnamese authorities are willing to act as American running dogs, carrying out terror and repression against the people and impoverishing them more and more, causing South Vietnam's industry and agriculture to deteriorate.

The letter expressed sympathy for the current difficult situation of many industrialists and businessmen in South Vietnam.

The letter suggested that the South Vietnamese Bureau of Commerce send a commercial delegation to North Vietnam to visit. The letter also stated that as long as the other party agrees, North Vietnam will also send a delegation to visit South Vietnam. The letter said that if both parties can make contact, they can further sign trade contracts. North Vietnam will purchase South Vietnam's rubber, coconut oil, fish sauce, etc., and South Vietnam can also purchase North Vietnam's cement, coal, and tobacco leaves, etc.

　　建议南北双方恢复贸易
    新华社河内13日电　越南北方国营百货、花纱布、食品、医药等公司的经理11日联名写信给南越商务局和南越工商业家，建议南北双方恢复正常的商业往来。
    信里说，越南南北两地应该交流物资和互通有无。信里说，过去北越贸易部门曾经多次提出上述建议，但是都没有得到南越当局的答复。
    信里谴责美帝国主义对南越的经济侵略和通过美“援”来奴役南越，使南越的经济愈加困难。信里说：南越当局甘心充当美国的走狗，对人民施行恐怖镇压和使人民越来越贫穷化，使南越的工农业每况愈下。
    信里对南越的许多工商业家当前的困难处境表示同情。
    信里建议南越商务局派一个商业代表团到北越来参观。信里还表示，只要对方同意，北越也将派代表团去南越参观。信里说，如果双方能够接触，就可以进一步签订贸易合同。北越将购买南越的橡胶、椰油、鱼水等，南越也可以购买北越的水泥、煤和烟丝等。
