    Guanyintang, Baofeng County, Henan Province, located on the northeastern foothills of the Funiu Mountains, is a mountainous area of ​​more than twenty miles in radius, with interlocking peaks and undulating hills. The heroic people of the mountainous area have recently launched a vigorous struggle against drought.
    The mountain land consists of terraces and embankments. In the Guo Gou Hu Fa Water Production Team, the highest terrace at Xiaoshi Zhaipo is 250 meters. The corn on the mountain is suffering severely from drought, and the leaves have turned yellow. After the Party branch issued the call to "not be afraid of high mountains, not be afraid of dry land, and be sure to overcome disasters and ensure high yields," the entire team mobilized more than fifty laborers and auxiliary laborers. The young and strong carried water, and the elderly lifted water, following the winding mountain paths, like climbing a ladder, carrying buckets and jars of water up the mountain. Hu Da-jun, a female member, led a "Liu Hulan Fighting Team" and even started a water-carrying competition with the men's team. Hu Da-jun carried twenty-eight loads of water a day, three more than her husband.
    The mountains of Guanyintang are discontinuous. To dig canals and divert water, one must pass through mountain ridges and deep gullies. The Xianglu Nian Production Team dug a canal from Chanlongzhu, diverting water two and a half miles to Xia Duo, passing through six large gullies more than two zhang deep. In order to get the water to the fields one day earlier, Yang Jucai, the provincial labor model and secretary of the Party branch, worked with the commune members to build bridges with stones and wood. But after the thirteen people worked for half a day, either the wood was too short or there were leaks. He was sweating profusely with anxiety. When Yang Jucai went home for lunch, he told his mother about building bridges to fight drought and save seedlings, and immediately received the support of this 70-year-old woman. She took out a piece of homemade white cloth that had been stored for nine years, more than thirteen meters long, and asked her son to make a cloth water pipe. Moved by her noble collectivist spirit, the commune members offered to lend materials. After a hard afternoon of work, six "sky bridges" were built, and the water from Chanlongzhu finally flowed over, irrigating ninety-six mu of corn in three days.

    开山劈岭引水上山
    位于伏牛山东北麓的河南省宝丰县观音堂，是一个方圆二十余里、群蜂交错、丘陵起伏的山区。英雄的山区人民，最近掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗旱斗争。
    山地除了堰滩就是梯田。郭沟胡发水生产队，在小石砦坡修的梯田最高的有二百五十米，山上的玉米旱得厉害，叶子已发黄了。党支部发出了“不怕山高，不怕地干，一定要战胜灾害保丰产”的号召后，全队出动了五十多个劳动力和辅助劳力，青壮年担水，老年抬水，顺着弯曲的羊肠小道，像上云梯一样，把一桶桶一罐罐的水运到山上去。女团员胡大俊率领的一支刘胡兰战斗队，还跟男子队展开了担水比赛。胡大俊一天担水二十八挑，比她丈夫还多担三挑。
    观音堂的群山是断续的。凿渠引水要经过山岭，也要经过深沟。香炉埝生产队从缠龙柱开了一条沟，引水二里半地到下垛，中间隔了六条两丈多深的大沟。为了使水早一天流到田里，省劳动模范、党支部书记杨聚才同志，同社员们忙着用石头木料搭桥。可是搭呀搭呀，十三个人架了半天，不是木料短，就是漏水，他急得满头淌汗。中午回家吃饭时，杨聚才把搭桥抗旱救苗的事向他母亲讲了，马上得到了这位七十多岁老人的支持。她从箱子里拿出了存放九年的一个土白布，足足有十三米多长，叫儿子拿去做布水管，在她老人家这种高尚的集体主义精神感动下，社员们纷纷借出材料。经过一下午的苦战，架成了六座天桥，缠龙柱的水终于流过来了，三天就浇了九十六亩玉米。
