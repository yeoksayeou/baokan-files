　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th August: Shandong Province has completed another 100-cubic-meter blast furnace. The Zhangdian Steel Plant's No. 4 blast furnace in Zibo City produced its first molten iron on the 10th, adding new strength to ensure the completion of the province's steel production tasks.

　　Since the trial production of this blast furnace began on the 2nd, production has been normal, and the sulfur content of the iron is only 0.083%.

　　In the process of building this blast furnace, the Zhangdian Steel Plant received enthusiastic support from more than 60 factories and mines in 11 provinces and cities, including Fujian, Heilongjiang, Beijing, and Shanghai. The Wuxi Machine Tool Plant manufactured two 200-cubic-meter blowers for the blast furnace. Workers in Beijing and Shanghai manufactured important equipment such as water pumps, boilers, and steam turbines. A naval unit of the People's Liberation Army provided three sets of gas masks and 300 oxygen cylinders. Jinan Steel Plant also trained 95 iron smelting workers for Zhangdian Steel Plant.

　　Xinhua News Agency: Ten thousand workers from the Harbin Railway Bureau are speeding up the construction of the Harbin-Hegang and Harbin-Suifenhe railway double tracks to meet the needs of increasing coal and timber production in the area. Currently, 168 kilometers of these two double tracks have been laid, and some sections have already been opened to traffic. More than 62% of the total earthwork of the two double tracks has also been completed.

　　山东又建成百立米高炉
　　黑龙江加紧修建两条铁路复线
    新华社济南11日电　山东省又有一座一百立方米高炉——淄博市张店钢铁厂四号高炉在10日流出铁水，为保证完成全省钢铁生产任务增添了一份新的力量。
    这座高炉从2日开始试生产以来，生产情况正常，铁的含硫量只有0.083％。
    张店钢铁厂在建设这座高炉的过程中，得到了福建、黑龙江、北京、上海等十一个省市六十多个厂矿的热情支援。无锡机床厂为这座高炉制造了两台二百立方米风量的鼓风机，北京、上海的工人为它制造了水泵、锅炉、汽轮机等重要设备，人民解放军海军某部支援了三套防毒面具和三百个生氧罐。济南钢铁厂还为张店钢铁厂培训了九十五名炼铁工人。
    新华社讯　哈尔滨铁路局上万名职工，正加紧修建哈（尔滨）—鹤（岗）、哈（尔滨）—绥（绥芬河）两条铁路复线，以适应这一地区增产煤炭、木材的需要。现在这两条复线已铺轨一百六十八公里，部分线路已经通车。两条复线的全部土石方工作量也已完成了62％以上。
