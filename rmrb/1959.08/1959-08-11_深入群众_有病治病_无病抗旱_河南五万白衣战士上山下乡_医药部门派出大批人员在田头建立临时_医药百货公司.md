Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th: Currently, Henan Province has 50,000 medical workers serving the 20 million-strong drought resistance army day and night. At the same time, Henan's pharmaceutical departments are also vigorously supporting the drought resistance struggle, supplying a large number of heatstroke prevention medicines.

As soon as the drought resistance began, these medical workers organized several thousand medical teams and groups, rushed to the front lines of drought resistance, set up tents in the fields, established temporary medical stations, and began work. They implemented a system of dividing and contracting areas and established a regional responsibility system, proposing: wherever there is a drought resistance army, there will be medicine and first-aiders. Three thousand medical personnel in Yu County went deep into the mountainous areas, ate and lived with the drought resistance army, and carried out prevention and treatment. Almost all medical personnel worked with the drought resistance army in the fields, treating illnesses and preventing drought when healthy.

These medical workers also went deep into the masses and the fields to carry out health knowledge publicity and education, assisting Party organizations and administrative leaders of communes and teams in doing a good job in battlefield heatstroke prevention and food hygiene work, ensuring the health of commune members. Medical personnel in Fugou County also compiled more than 1,000 handbooks on heatstroke prevention, first aid, hygiene, and other knowledge, and distributed them to health workers to publicize them to the masses in dining halls, fields, and field edges. They were responsible for guiding and checking the heatstroke prevention equipment carried by the drought resistance army when going to the fields every day and were responsible for checking the food hygiene of the commune members. In some places, medical personnel also helped train cooks to ensure that the drought resistance army ate well and the food was clean. They helped establish tea stations in many places where the drought resistance army was concentrated and disinfected public teacups. These hardworking medical personnel also tried their best to make heatstroke prevention medicine locally. Medical workers in Shangcheng County used mung bean soup, white sugar, and mint to make "local soda" for the drought resistance army. All of this guaranteed the health of the drought resistance army.

All pharmaceutical departments in Henan Province also took action. Within a few days, they sent heatstroke prevention medicines such as Rendan, cooling oil, and Shidi Water worth 5 million yuan to the fields. Pharmaceutical companies in the four special districts of Luoyang, Xinxiang, Xuchang, and Xinyang dispatched more than 1,000 salespeople, carrying medicines to establish temporary "pharmaceutical department stores" in places where the drought resistance army was concentrated, which greatly facilitated the commune members.

    深入群众　有病治病　无病抗旱
　　河南五万白衣战士上山下乡
　　医药部门派出大批人员在田头建立临时“医药百货公司”
    新华社郑州10日电　河南省目前有五万名白衣战士，日夜为两千万抗旱大军服务。与此同时，河南医药部门也大力支援抗旱斗争，供应了大批防暑药物。
    这些医务工作者，在抗旱一开始，便组织了几千个医疗队、组，开赴抗旱前线，在田间搭起了帐棚，成立了临时医疗站，展开了工作。他们实行了分片包干的办法，建立了地区责任制，提出：哪里有抗旱大军，哪里就有医药和急救员。禹县的三千名医务人员，深入山区，和抗旱大军一同食宿，进行预防治疗。几乎所有医务人员都是和抗旱大军一起活动在田间，有病治病，无病抗旱。
    这些医务工作者，还深入群众、田间开展卫生知识宣传教育，协助党组织和社队行政领导做好战地防暑工作和饮食卫生工作，保证社员身体健康。扶沟县医务人员还编写了有关防暑、急救、卫生等知识手册一千多本，发给保健员，在饭厅、田间、场边向广大群众宣传。他们每天负责指导检查抗旱大军下地时所带的防暑用具，负责检查社员的饮食卫生。有些地方的医务人员并帮助训练炊事员，保证抗旱大军吃好、吃的食物干净。他们在许多抗旱大军集中的地方，帮助建立茶水站，对公用的茶杯实行消毒。这些辛苦的医务人员，还想尽各种办法，就地取材制成防暑药水，商城县的医务工作者用绿豆汤、白糖和薄荷，为抗旱大军制成“土汽水”。这一切，都保证了抗旱大军的身体健康。
    河南省的所有医药部门也行动起来了，几天内，就把价值五百万元的人丹、清凉油、十滴水等防暑药品送到田间。洛阳、新乡、许昌、信阳四个专区的医药公司派出一千多名售货员，携带药品在抗旱大军集中的地方，建立临时“医药百货公司”，大大方便了社员。（附图片）
