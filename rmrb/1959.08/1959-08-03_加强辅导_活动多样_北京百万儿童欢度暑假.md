    Strengthen Tutoring, Diversify Activities
    Beijing's Million Children Happily Spend Summer Vacation
    (Our report) During this summer vacation, Beijing has organized rich and varied summer activities for the city's 1,040,000 children. Many government offices, military units, factories, mines, enterprises, universities, and street offices have arranged summer activity venues for the children, strengthening the tutoring work during their holidays. Before the summer vacation, the Central Government Departments raised this issue at the joint meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries, requesting everyone to arrange the children's summer lives well, and assigned the Communist Youth League Committee to be responsible for leading this work, and also selected some excellent Communist Youth League members as counselors. For example, a staff dormitory of a Central Government Department with dozens of children, due to the attention and care of the Department's Party Committee and the Communist Youth League Committee, hired excellent worker counselors for the children, conscientiously tutored and arranged the children's holiday activities, attracting the children from a scattered and unregulated life to a regular and meaningful collective life.
    More than a dozen out-of-school education institutions in the city have organized garden parties, costume story sessions, star-gazing parties, and get-togethers for the children, with an estimated total of over 200 events.
    The Working People's Cultural Palace and the Children's Palace have also held two summer camps for children, one located in the scenic Jade Peak (鹫峰), and one located within the Working People's Cultural Palace, where more than 3,000 children are happily spending their holidays in batches. To ensure the activities are carried out well, more than 100 high school and normal school students have also been organized to participate in the summer camp as counselors in batches.
    Two hundred Young Pioneers from Beijing were also invited by Comrade Hai Jun to have a lively and novel camping experience on the beautiful Changshan Island. They set off on July 29th, carrying the Beijing Young Pioneers' love and respect for the Navy uncles.
    During the summer vacation, the Bureau of Culture, the Municipal Sports Commission, the Municipal Science Popularization Association, the Planetarium, and other units have also organized a variety of activities for the children, such as opera, movies, swimming, table tennis, water polo, airplane gliding performances, and celestial phenomenon performances.
    In order to ensure that the city's 1,040,000 children have a good summer vacation, Beijing also convened a guidance committee for out-of-school education work, emphasizing the need to widely mobilize social forces to jointly carry out summer activities for children.

    加强辅导　活动多样
    北京百万儿童欢度暑假
    本报讯　在今年暑假当中，北京市为全市一百零四万少年儿童，组织了丰富多彩的暑假活动。很多机关、部队、厂矿、企业、院校以及街道办事处都为孩子们安排了暑假活动的场所，加强了对孩子们假期的辅导工作。中直机关在放暑假前，机关党委书记联席会上就提出了这个问题，要求大家很好地安排孩子们的暑假生活，并责成团委负责领导这项工作，还选派了一些优秀的共青团员作辅导员。如中直机关一个拥有数十名少年儿童的职工宿舍，由于在机关党委和团委的重视关怀下，为孩子们聘请了优秀的工人辅导员，认真地辅导和安排了孩子们的假期活动，把孩子们从散漫无规律的生活吸引到有规律有意义的集体生活中来了。
    全市十几个校外教育机关，为孩子们组织了游园晚会，化装故事会，星空晚会，联欢会等活动，预计有二百多场。
    劳动人民文化宫和少年宫还举办了两所少年儿童夏令营，一处设在风景优美的鹫峰，一处设在劳动人民文化宫内，有三千多孩子分批在这里愉快渡过假日生活。为使活动开展的好，还组织了一百多名高中，师范学生分批参加夏令营担任辅导员工作。
    北京市还有二百名少先队员应海军同志的邀请，去美丽的长山岛过活泼新颖的野营生活，他们已于7月29日带着北京市少先队员对海军叔叔的热爱和敬意出发了。
    暑假期间，文化局、市体委、市科学普及协会、天文馆等单位，也分别为孩子们组织了戏曲、电影、游泳，乒乓球、水球、飞机滑翔表演、天象表演等丰富多彩的活动。
    为了让全市一百零四万少年儿童过好暑假生活，北京市还召开了校外教育工作指导委员会，着重指出要广泛地发动社会力量，共同搞好少年儿童暑假活动。
