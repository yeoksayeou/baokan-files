Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 19th - According to materials published here, currently, in Romania, on average, almost one in eight people is studying. There are 38.5 university students per 10,000 people, a ratio exceeding the levels of developed capitalist countries in Europe such as France, Italy, and Switzerland.

Before liberation, Romania was one of the most culturally backward countries in Europe. In 1940, there were more than 3.6 million illiterate people in the country, accounting for 28.8% of the population over the age of seven. With the rapid development of socialist economic construction, the face of Romanian culture and education has undergone fundamental changes. Romania has long since eliminated illiteracy, all school-age children are able to enroll, and seven-year compulsory education has been universally implemented nationwide. In 1959, the number of primary schools nationwide increased 4.8 times compared to 1938 before liberation. The number of secondary schools increased from 211 in 1938 to the current 359; the number of secondary school students increased from 29,000 to more than 113,000. The number of higher education institutions increased from 16 in 1938 to the current 35; the number of university students increased from more than 26,000 to 70,000.

Like all socialist countries, Romanian schools at all levels primarily open their doors to the children of workers and peasants. Currently, students from worker and peasant families account for 75% of university students and 63% of secondary school students. In order to enable the vast number of worker-peasant cadres to become specialized talents with modern scientific and cultural knowledge, the Romanian Party and government have taken a number of important measures, and the large-scale establishment of night schools and correspondence schools at all levels is one of these measures. Since their establishment in 1950, advanced night schools and correspondence schools have trained a total of 6,000 people. Intermediate night schools and correspondence schools have trained a total of 35,000 people from 1954 to the present. In addition, trade unions and science and technology popularization associations and other units have established 90 amateur people's universities in urban and rural areas, with a current enrollment of more than 9,000 people.

When implementing educational reform in 1948, the Romanian Party and government put forward the policy of combining education with production. In the past two years, they have further emphasized the importance of combining education with production and labor, and have successively adopted a series of effective measures. At present, in Romanian schools at all levels, production practice has become an integral part of the learning process. Students studying in engineering and agricultural colleges first go to industrial and mining enterprises or farms for six months to ten months of production practice after enrollment, and then have four to seven weeks of practice time each year during the subsequent learning process. They also undergo a period of production practice upon graduation. In the seven-year primary schools, courses teaching industrial and agricultural knowledge have now been added, and the time for production practice has been increased. In order to better cultivate the labor perspective of the younger generation, the Romanian Working Youth League also organizes young people to actively participate in various voluntary labor activities during holidays.

In order to cultivate new-type proletarian intellectuals, the Romanian Party and government attach great importance to the political and ideological education of young people. Higher education institutions and secondary schools are currently strengthening the Marxist-Leninist theoretical education of young people, and are paying attention to criticizing various bourgeois and idealist ideas among young people.

　　罗马尼亚教育事业欣欣向荣
　　按人口平均的学生人数超过法意水平
　　教育同生产相结合培养新型知识分子
    新华社布加勒斯特19日电　据这里发表的材料，目前，在罗马尼亚平均不到八个人就有一个人在学习；每一万个人当中就有三十八点五名大学生，这个比例超过了欧洲发达的资本主义国家法国、意大利和瑞士的水平。
    解放以前，罗马尼亚是欧洲文化落后的国家之一。1940年，全国共有文盲三百六十多万，占全国七岁以上人口的28.8％。随着社会主义经济建设事业的飞跃发展，罗马尼亚文化教育事业的面貌也有了根本的改变。罗马尼亚早已全部扫除了文盲，所有学龄儿童都能入学，七年制的义务教育已经普遍在全国推行。1959年，全国小学校比解放前1938年增加了四点八倍。中等学校由1938年的二百一十一所增加到目前的三百五十九所；中学生的人数由两万九千人增加到十一万三千多人。高等学校由1938年的十六所增加到目前的三十五所；大学生人数由二万六千多人增加到七万人。
    同所有社会主义国家一样，罗马尼亚的各级学校首先为广大工农子弟开门。目前，在大学生当中，工农家庭出身的占75％，在中学生中占63％。为了使广大工农干部能够成为有现代科学文化知识的专门人才，罗马尼亚党和政府曾采取了若干重要的措施，大量兴办各级夜校和函授学校是这些措施之一。从1950年建立以来，高级夜校和函授学校共培养出了六千人。中级夜校和函授学校从1954年到现在共培养了三万五千人。此外，在城市和农村中还由工会和科学技术普及协会等单位举办了九十所业余性质的人民大学，学习的人数现在共有九千多人。
    罗马尼亚党和政府在1948年实行教育改革时，就提出了教育同生产相结合的方针，而在最近两年来，更强调了教育同生产、劳动相结合的重要性，并陆续采取了一系列有效的措施。目前，在罗马尼亚的各级学校中，生产实习已是学习过程中的一个不可分割的组成部分。在工科和农学院学习的学生入学以后，首先要到工矿企业或农场进行半年到十个月的生产实习，在以后的学习过程中每年还有四至七星期的实习时间，在毕业时也要进行一个时期的生产实习。在七年制的小学中，现在也都添设了讲授工农业知识的课程和增加了生产实习的时间。为了更好地培养青年一代的劳动观点，罗马尼亚劳动青年联盟还利用假日组织广大青年积极参加各种义务劳动。
    为了培养出新型的无产阶级的知识分子，罗马尼亚党和政府十分重视对青年的政治思想教育，高等学校和中等学校目前都加强了对青年的马克思列宁主义理论教育，并且注意批判青年当中的各种资产阶级的思想和唯心主义思想。
