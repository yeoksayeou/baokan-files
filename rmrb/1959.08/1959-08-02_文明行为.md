    Civilized Behavior
    Qin Li
    A comrade with not-so-good health told me that he has encountered the following situation more than once: when he is concentrating on his work at home, someone suddenly appears behind him and starts talking. It turns out to be a young person he doesn't know, who has come to talk about something. This sudden appearance startled him, who suffers from neurasthenia. My friend had neither been informed in advance that someone would be visiting, nor did he hear anyone knock on the door. The young person just "barged in." How "unrestrained," "intimate," and "unceremonious" it seems!
    Due to the changes in the nature of society and the changes in the relationships between people, some of the cumbersome formalities and even reactionary things of the old era are naturally undesirable. However, some necessary rules of etiquette are still needed. For example, when going to someone's home, one should consider their convenience and knock on the door before entering, as the saying goes, "announce your presence before entering." These things are not undesirable "old ethics" but are compatible with the collectivist new society. To barge in and out without permission is extremely free for the person barging in, but what about the person being barged in on? Isn't that very unfree? Is it a good ideological style to only care about one's own freedom and not care about the freedom of others?
    If one is happy to turn on the radio, one turns it on full blast, audible for miles, without considering whether the neighbors like to listen, or whether it will interfere with their work, rest, and sleep. Can this be considered the virtue of being "unconventional and unrestrained"? In the office, some people open other people's letters and read them without permission. What is that?
    Nurseries and kindergartens teach children to be polite, to greet people when they see them, and to say goodbye when they leave. These seem like small things, but they are necessary preliminary education. Cultivating people with high cultural cultivation is our goal.
    Only socialist and even future communist societies are truly civilized societies. Let us more and more thoroughly eliminate the individualistic and barbaric imprints brought from the old society!

    文明行为
    秦犁
    一位身体不大好的同志对我说，他不止一回碰到这种事：当他在家专心工作的时候，忽然有人出现在他身后，说起话来，原来是一位不相识的年轻人，来找他谈一件事。这突然出现，使神经衰弱的他吃了一惊。我的朋友既未事前得知有人要来访问，也没有听见他敲过门，年轻人就这末“破门而入”了。多么显得“不拘小节”，“亲切”而不“见外”！
    由于社会性质的改变，人与人之间的关系的改变，旧时代的一些繁文缛节，甚至反动的东西，自然是要不得的了。但是，有一些必要的规矩礼貌还是需要的。比如到人家家里去，应该考虑到人家的方便，进门之前应该敲门，所谓“入室扬声”，得到人家允许。这些东西不是要不得的“旧礼教”，而是与集体主义新社会相适应的。不得允许，闯进闯出，对闯的人说来，是自由极了，但对被闯者说来呢？岂不很不自由吗？只顾自己自由，不顾人家的自由，这是好的思想作风吗？
    自己高兴开收音机，就大开特开，声闻数里，不顾邻居爱不爱听，是否会妨碍人家的工作、休息和睡眠，这算是“落拓不羁”的美德吗？在办公室内，有的人未得允许随便打开别人的信看，这又算是什么呢？
    托儿所、幼儿园教育孩子们要有礼貌，见人问好，临走告别，看来是些小事，却是必要的初步的教育。培养有高度文化教养的人，是我们努力的目标。
    只有社会主义、以至将来的共产主义社会才是真正的文明社会，让我们更多地、彻底地汰除从旧社会带来的个人主义的野蛮印记吧！
