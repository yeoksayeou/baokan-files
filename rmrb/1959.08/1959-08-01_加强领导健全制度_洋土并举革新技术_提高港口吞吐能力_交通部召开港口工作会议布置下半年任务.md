Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, July 31st: The Ministry of Communications recently held a national port work conference in Lushun-Dalian, calling on port workers across the country to deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, improve the cargo throughput capacity of ports, accelerate the turnaround of vehicles and ships, and successfully complete the cargo transportation tasks for the second half of the year.

The conference pointed out that the movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, has been vigorously launched in the country's twenty-eight major ports, and labor productivity has also significantly improved. However, in order to complete the heavier task of transferring industrial and agricultural products in the second half of the year, it is necessary to continue to leverage equipment potential and further improve the throughput capacity of ports.

The conference emphasized that while vigorously promoting mass movements, it is necessary to strengthen centralized leadership over port work and establish and improve management systems. In terms of planning management, the current focus should be on doing a good job of monthly plans, using monthly plans as the basis for compiling ten-day, daily, and day-and-night shift operation plans, in order to organize good work order. The conference also proposed establishing and improving accountability systems around improving transportation quality. The conference believes that the system of responsible inspection of freight quality at all levels implemented by Yichang Port, the regular inspection system implemented by Qinhuangdao Port, and the "Cargo Loading Quality Guarantee" system implemented by Qingdao and other ports all provide good experiences for eliminating accidents and reducing freight damage.

Since ports are the hubs of water and land transportation, and are connected to many aspects, the conference believes that a vast collaboration between ports, cargo owners, vehicles, and ships should be well organized. In this way, it will be possible to better organize comprehensive balance and improve the turnaround rate of vehicles and ships.

Further developing technological innovation and technological revolution, targeting the weak links in current port work, was one of the central topics of this conference. The conference proposed the following guidelines in this regard: combining foreign and indigenous methods, combining large and small [projects], continuously improving, and moving from indigenous to foreign. The conference summarized and exchanged more than sixty advanced technical experiences in six aspects, including cargo unloading from holds, stacking, and loading and unloading large vehicles, and plans to promote them comprehensively in a planned manner. Among them, Huangshi Port created mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading operation lines for coal, cement, steel and other goods on ten wharves by using handcarts, chain plate conveyors, belt conveyors, cable cars and other machinery and tools, which increased loading and unloading efficiency by more than double compared to the past. The winch crane created by Dalian Port has also increased the efficiency of unloading heavy logs from vehicles by several times.

At this conference, representatives from Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Wuhan and other ports also proposed to launch inter-port competitions to ports across the country, which was echoed by representatives from various ports.

The conference lasted for ten days and closed on July 25. Representatives from fifty-five units, including national river and sea transportation lines and large and medium-sized local inland river ports, participated in the conference. The Communications Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the State Economic Commission, the State Planning Commission, and the Chinese Seamen's Union also sent people to participate in the conference.

    加强领导健全制度  洋土并举革新技术
    提高港口吞吐能力
    交通部召开港口工作会议布置下半年任务
    新华社旅大31日电　交通部最近在旅大市召开了全国港口工作会议，号召全国港口职工深入开展增产节约运动，提高港口的货物通过能力，以加快车船周转速度，出色地完成下半年的货物运输任务。
    会议指出，全国二十八个主要港口，以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动已经蓬勃展开，劳动生产率也有显著提高。但是，为了完成下半年更加繁重的工农业产品调运任务，今后必须继续发挥设备潜力，进一步提高港口的吞吐能力。
    会议强调在大搞群众运动的同时，加强对港口工作的集中领导，建立和健全管理制度。在计划管理方面，当前要着重搞好月计划，以月计划为基础编制旬、日及昼夜分班作业计划，以组织良好的工作秩序。会议还提出要围绕提高运输质量，建立和健全责任制度。会议认为，宜昌港实行的层层负责检查货运质量的制度，秦皇岛港实行的定期检查制度，以及青岛等港实行的“货物装船质量保证书”等制度，都为消灭事故、减少货运损坏提供了好的经验。
    由于港口是水陆运输的枢纽，联系的方面很多，会议认为应该很好地组织港口、货主、车、船之间的一条庞大协作。这样，就能更好地组织综合平衡，提高车船周转率。
    针对当前港口工作的薄弱环节，进一步开展技术革新和技术革命，是这次会议的中心议题之一。会议在这方面提出的方针是：洋土并举，大小结合，不断提高，从土到洋。会上总结交流了货物出舱、码垛、装卸大车等六个方面的六十多项先进技术经验，准备有计划地全面推广。其中，黄石港创造了用手推车、链板机、皮带机、缆车等机械和工具，在十座码头上组成煤炭、水泥、钢材等货物的机械化和半机械化装卸作业线，使装卸效率比过去提高一倍多。大连港创造的辘辘吊，也使笨重的原木卸车效率提高了几倍。
    这次会上，大连、秦皇岛和武汉等港口的代表还向全国各港口提出了展开港际竞赛的倡议，得到了各港口代表的响应。
    会议共举行了十天，在7月25日闭幕。参加会议的有全国江海运输干线、地方内河大中港口等五十五个单位的代表。中共中央交通工作部、国家经济委员会、国家计划委员会和中国海员工会也派人参加了会议。（附图片）
