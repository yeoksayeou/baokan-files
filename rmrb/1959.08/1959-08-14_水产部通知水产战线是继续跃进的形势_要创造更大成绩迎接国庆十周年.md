Xinhua News Agency, 12th - The Ministry of Aquatic Products issued an urgent notice, requiring all localities to seize the aquatic products work in August and September, further launch a vigorous and lively campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's third-quarter aquatic products production and procurement tasks.

The notice said that the production and supply of aquatic products in the first half of this year had made great achievements. The task in the second half of the year remains very arduous. At present, the situation on the entire aquatic products front is one of continued great leap forward. All localities must seize this favorable situation, overcome the fear of difficulties and slackening emotions among some cadres, summon up energy, set off a new upsurge of mass movement in the shortest possible time, mobilize the masses to innovate technology, strictly increase production and practice economy, and greet the great 10th anniversary of National Day with the achievements of completing and overfulfilling the third quarter's aquatic products production, procurement, and allocation tasks.

The notice requires all localities to first focus on marine and freshwater fishing production in August and September, striving for a non-slack season. The notice pointed out that although the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea fishing grounds are in the off-season for marine fishing, the South China Sea fishing grounds are in the season of the autumn wind head fishing flood in September; the northern fishing grounds, according to historical statistics, the output in the third quarter also accounts for about 17% of the total annual output, and it is entirely possible to strive for a bumper harvest in the off-season. Therefore, all localities must continue to put all usable boats, nets, and tools into production. The boats and nets that need to be repaired should strive to basically complete the repairs in the shortest possible time by adopting self-reliance methods, overcome the idea of simply waiting or completely relying on the state to supply fishery materials, and strive to complete the original marine fishing tasks within the third quarter.

The notice said that due to the large-scale aquaculture last year, most of the two-year-old fish are currently in the mature stage. In addition, fewer fish were caught in rivers and lakes in the second half of last year. Therefore, this year's off-season freshwater fish will be more than last year. All freshwater fishery areas should immediately organize professional teams to do a good job in repairing and adding boats and nets, and fully utilize all original boats, nets, and tools to engage in large-scale river and lake fishing.

The notice requires relevant departments in all localities to strengthen the procurement of aquatic products. The notice pointed out that in order to support the third quarter's aquatic products production, areas with relatively weak procurement forces should quickly add necessary institutions and strengthen procurement forces according to the specific situation; areas with relatively sound general institutions should regularly organize procurement alongside ships and mobile procurement; and, in view of the fact that summer fish and goods are prone to deterioration, proper processing, storage, and preservation work should be done.

The notice also put forward requirements for doing a good job in the supply of fishery materials.

### 水产部通知水产战线是继续跃进的形势　要创造更大成绩迎接国庆十周年

　　水产部通知水产战线是继续跃进的形势
　　要创造更大成绩迎接国庆十周年
    新华社12日讯　水产部发出紧急通知，要求各地抓紧8、9两个月的水产工作，进一步开展一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，努力完成和超额完成今年第三季度水产生产和收购等任务。
    通知说，今年上半年水产的生产和供应工作有很大成绩。下半年任务仍是十分艰巨。目前整个水产战线上的形势是继续跃进的形势。各地必须抓住这一有利形势，克服部分干部中畏难松劲情绪，鼓足干劲，在最短时间内掀起一个新的群众运动高潮，发动群众革新技术，厉行增产节约，用完成和超额完成第三季度水产生产、收购和调拨任务的成绩迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    通知要求各地首先大抓8、9月份的海洋和淡水捕捞生产，争取淡季不淡。通知指出，在海洋捕捞方面东海、黄海、渤海渔场虽是淡季，但南海渔场9月份正是秋风头渔汛的季节；北部渔场，根据历年的统计，第三季度的产量也占全年总产量的17％左右，争取淡季丰收完全有可能。因此，各地必须把一切可以使用的船网工具，继续投入生产。需要修补的船网，力争在最短期内采取自力更生的办法基本修补完毕，克服单纯等待或完全依靠国家供应渔需物资的思想，努力在第三季度内完成原订的海洋捕捞任务。
    通知说，由于去年大搞养殖，绝大部分二年生长的鱼目前正在成熟阶段，加之去年下半年江河湖泊里的鱼捕得较少，因此今年淡季的淡水鱼会比去年多，各淡水渔业区应立即组织专业队伍，做好船网的修补和添置工作，充分使一切原有的船网工具，大搞江河湖泊捕捞。
    通知要求各地有关部门加强水产品的收购工作。通知指出，为了支持第三季度的水产生产，收购力量比较薄弱的产区，应根据具体情况迅速地增设必要的机构，加强收购力量；一般机构比较健全的地区，应经常地组织随船收购和流动收购；并针对夏季鱼货容易变质的情况，妥善做好加工储藏保管工作。
    通知对做好渔需物资供应工作，也提出了要求。
