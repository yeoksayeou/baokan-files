Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, July 31st: The Fushun Shengli Coal Mine completed its July crude coal production plan two days ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of July, the Shengli Coal Mine workers have launched a production competition upsurge between workshops, shifts, and teams. By the 29th, twelve of the sixteen coal-producing shifts had already overfulfilled their work plans ahead of schedule.

In the competition, underground workers promoted three-shift mixed operations and four-shift cross operations according to different working face conditions, greatly shortening filling time and non-production time. Mechanical and electrical workers formed more than twenty shock teams, going to the most needed places to repair machinery at any free time, ensuring the normal operation of various machines. Old workers in the coal preparation plant successfully researched and improved the winch clutch, which also enabled the coal from the underground to be transported to the surface in a timely manner.

Leading cadres of the Shengli Coal Mine often go to the workshops to discover and solve key problems, and strengthen leadership over the competition. At the same time, this mine has particularly strengthened mass safety management, improved safety supervision institutions and mass safety inspection networks. This has played a great role in increasing production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 31st: The Hebi Mining Bureau overfulfilled its July coal production plan by 2.4% three days ahead of schedule, and the gangue content of the coal was lower than the national standard.

In July, the Hebi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened the publicity and education work on increasing production and saving coal among all mine workers, and drew a group of personnel from the municipal directly-affiliated agencies and the Mining Bureau to the mine to take measures to strengthen weak links together with the workers, which powerfully promoted production. In addition, while organizing competitions, the mines mobilized the masses to establish and improve rules and regulations, and strengthened enterprise management.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 31st: The Shandong Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, which produces high-quality coking coal, has been gradually improving the efficiency of coal mining and tunneling due to vigorous improvement and strengthening of enterprise management. In mid-July, the average daily output of raw coal of the entire mine increased by 3.85% compared with the first ten days of the month, and from July 21st to 29th, it increased by another 7.15% compared with mid-July; the average daily tunneling footage in June was 549 meters, and from July 1st to 29th, it had risen to 598 meters.

In the past two months, the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau has held five-level cadre meetings to check the main problems in production, and mobilized the masses of workers to put forward solutions. In particular, the rectification and improvement of important rules and regulations, and the restoration and improvement of some organizational structures, have played a considerable role in promoting production.

Recently, the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau transferred nearly a hundred outstanding workers and cadres to enrich mines, work areas, and teams, and strengthened the leadership of grassroots work. At the same time, leading cadres at all levels, such as the director of the Mining Bureau, the mine director, and the chief engineer, also frequently went deep into the scene to direct production. In addition, attention was also paid to improving the lives of workers. These have inspired the labor enthusiasm of the workers.

    抚顺胜利矿和鹤壁矿务局报捷
    七月采煤计划超额完成
    枣庄矿务局优质炼焦煤产量逐旬增加
    据新华社抚顺31日电　抚顺胜利煤矿提前两天完成了7月份的原煤生产计划。
    进入7月以来，胜利煤矿职工掀起了车间与车间、班与班、组与组之间的生产竞赛热潮，到29日止，在十六个产煤班中，有十二个已经提前超额完成了作业计划。
    在竞赛中，井下工人根据不同的工作面条件，推行了三班混合作业和四班交叉作业，大大缩短了充填时间和非生产时间。机电工人组成了二十多个突击队，到最需要的地方，随时趁空子检修机械，保证了各种机械的正常运转。选煤厂的老工人研究改进绞车离合器成功，也使井下的煤能及时地运到井上。
    胜利煤矿的领导干部经常到车间去发现和解决关键问题，加强对竞赛的领导。同时这个矿特别加强了群众性的安全管理，健全安全监察机构和群众性的安全检查网。这对提高产量都起了很大作用。
    据新华社郑州31日电　鹤壁矿务局提前三天超额2.4％完成了7月份的煤炭生产计划，煤的含矸率低于国家规定的标准。
    7月份，中共鹤壁市委在全矿职工中加强了增产节约煤炭的宣传教育工作，并且从市直属机关和矿务局抽调出一批人员，到矿井同工人一起，采取措施加强薄弱环节，有力地促进了生产。此外，各矿在组织竞赛的同时，发动群众建立和健全了规章制度，加强了企业管理。
    据新华社济南31日电　生产优质炼焦煤的山东枣庄矿务局，由于大力改进和加强企业管理，采煤和掘进的效率都在逐步地提高。7月中旬，全矿的原煤平均日产量比上旬提高了3.85％，21日至29日又比中旬提高了7.15％；每天平均的掘进进尺，6月份是五百四十九米，7月1日到29日已上升到五百九十八米。
    近两个月来，枣庄矿务局曾经召开五级干部会议，检查了生产中的主要问题，发动职工群众提出了解决的办法。特别是整顿和健全重要的规章制度，恢复和健全一些组织机构，对促进生产起了相当大的作用。
    最近，枣庄矿务局抽调了近百名优秀工人和干部，充实矿井、工区、班组，加强了基层工作的领导。同时矿务局的局长、矿长、总工程师等各级领导干部，也都经常深入现场指挥生产。此外，还注意改善工人的生活。这些，都鼓舞了职工群众的劳动热情。
