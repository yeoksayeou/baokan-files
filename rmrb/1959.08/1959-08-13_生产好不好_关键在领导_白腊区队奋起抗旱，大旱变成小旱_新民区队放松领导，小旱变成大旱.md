　　Whether Production is Good Depends on Leadership
　　The Baila District Team Rises Up to Fight Drought, Turning Major Drought into Minor Drought
　　The Xinmin District Team Relaxes Leadership, Turning Minor Drought into Major Drought
    The Baila and Xinmin District Teams of Tieqiao Commune in Kai County, Sichuan, have basically the same conditions and were simultaneously hit by drought. However, due to the different attitudes of the cadres towards the drought, the results were completely different: the Baila District Team cadres had great determination, strengthened leadership, and rose up to fight the drought, ensuring the normal growth of crops and turning a major drought into a minor drought; the Xinmin District Team cadres were passive and afraid of difficulties, relaxed leadership, and waited for rain, turning a minor drought into a major drought, causing serious damage to seedlings.
    In early July, as soon as the signs of drought appeared, the Baila District Team Party Branch decisively convened a meeting of cadres to discuss drought resistance measures, mobilizing commune members to water seedlings. Later, as the drought became increasingly severe, the Party Branch promptly put forward the resounding slogan of "Rather shed a thousand drops of sweat than let a single seedling die," increased the drought resistance force, and established a drought resistance responsibility system, dividing the drought-affected crops into areas of responsibility. They adopted methods of assigning personnel, assigning sections of land, assigning time, assigning quality, assigning work points, and assigning rewards and punishments to complete the tasks within a specified time. Units and individuals with strong drive, quick action, and great achievements were praised and encouraged; those who were passive, afraid of difficulties, and slow to act were criticized and educated.
    From the Party Branch Secretary to every cadre and Party member in the Baila District Team, they all set an example and walked at the forefront of drought resistance. The Branch Secretary, Sun Chongwu, led the drought resistance shock team with tools to the most difficult sections to fight every day before dawn. He not only worked like the commune members, but also specifically chose the heaviest work to do. When the commune members rested, he stayed by their side to carry out propaganda and mobilization, stimulating the masses' enthusiasm for drought resistance. Tan Zuxuan, the Director of the Commune, saw that the late rice seedlings and sweet potato seedlings were tender and could not withstand the sun's exposure, so he ran home to take out the mats and bedsheets from his bed to build sheds to cover the seedling beds. The commune members were greatly encouraged and proposed: Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, everyone should contribute their treasures. The commune members of the entire district team immediately took out more than 290 mats to protect the seedlings; at the same time, they also watered them every day, so that the more than 40 mu of sweet potato seedling beds grew vigorously under the severe threat of drought. Driven by the exemplary actions of the cadres, a few commune members who lacked confidence in drought resistance also actively joined the battle. Xiong Futin, a commune member of the first team, initially believed that "nine out of ten times people lose when fighting against nature," and his actions were very passive. Later, he saw that positive drought resistance was indeed very effective, and his attitude changed greatly. He raced to work alongside the commune members to pump water for drought resistance. He said, "As long as everyone puts in their best effort, saving one piece is one piece saved, we will definitely win this time!"
    On July 16th, there was a light rain, and some commune members began to slack off. The Party Branch immediately held a meeting to patiently persuade the masses to continue to work hard and never stop until complete victory. Then, a new upsurge of drought resistance was launched. The entire team had 400 mu of intermediate rice, but only four flat ponds could irrigate a few dozen mu, and the rest had no water source guarantee. The Party Branch led the commune members to fight hard day and night, rushing to repair 15 weirs and ditches, diverting water to irrigate 125 mu of fields. At the same time, they made full use of drought resistance tools, arranging labor to take turns pumping water, with people resting but the tools never stopping. In this way, after arduous struggle, the normal heading and flowering of all the intermediate rice was guaranteed. For the 32 mu of corn that had not yet tasseled, in addition to loosening the soil, watering, and fertilizing, some leafy branches were also inserted into each hole to provide shade and resist drought.
    The amount of cultivated land borne by each laborer in the Xinmin District Team was about the same as that in the Baila District Team, and the water conservancy conditions were even better than those in the Baila District. In addition to four flat ponds, there was also a reservoir that could irrigate most of the paddy fields. When the signs of drought began to appear, the cadres of the district team were careless, thinking that there was water to irrigate the fields, so the problem was not big. The Party Branch Secretary of the district team only mentioned the emergency drought resistance notice issued by the commune Party committee in passing at a cadre meeting, without making specific arrangements, let alone taking immediate action. Subsequently, when the drought became more and more fierce and the situation became serious, they panicked and lost confidence, thinking that "the disaster is too great, it is useless to resist." Later, under the repeated urging of the commune Party committee, when they organized the masses to start drought resistance, they stopped again when there was a light rain on July 16th. The drought resistance team of more than 30 people that had just been organized by one group of the second team were all transferred to do other work, and the drought resistance struggle was stopped. In this way, due to poor leadership and hesitation, the opportunity was missed, the drought situation was expanded, and serious losses were caused. As a result, 40% of the 71 mu of late rice seedlings and sweet potato seedlings in the entire team dried up, more than 150 mu of the 450 mu of late corn dried up, and the more than 400 mu of intermediate rice fields were cracked, making heading and flowering very difficult.
    Recently, the Tieqiao Commune Party Committee criticized the right-leaning and fear-of-difficulty thinking of the Xinmin District Team cadres, and organized them to visit the Baila District in person. After the Xinmin District Team cadres returned from the visit, they immediately organized the masses, reorganized their forces, and decided to learn the "Man Can Conquer Nature" spirit of the Baila District, and set off a climax of the drought resistance struggle.　(Our reporter Liu Zongtang)

### 生产好不好　关键在领导　白腊区队奋起抗旱，大旱变成小旱　新民区队放松领导，小旱变成大旱

　　生产好不好　关键在领导
　　白腊区队奋起抗旱，大旱变成小旱
　　新民区队放松领导，小旱变成大旱
    四川开县铁桥公社白腊区队和新民区队，条件基本相同，同时受到干旱侵袭，但是由于干部对待干旱的态度不同，结果完全两样：白腊区队干部决心大，加强领导，奋起抗旱，保证了庄稼正常生长，使大旱变成了小旱；新民区队干部消极畏难，放松领导，等天下雨，使小旱变成了大旱，禾苗受到严重损失。
    7月上旬，旱象刚一露头，白腊区队党支部就当机立断，马上召开干部会议讨论抗旱办法，发动社员淋水保苗，后来旱象日益严重，党支部及时提出“宁流千滴汗，不死一株苗”的响亮口号，增加抗旱兵力，并建立了抗旱责任制，把受旱作物划片包干，采取定人员、定地段、定时间、定质量、定工分、定奖惩的办法，限期完成任务。对干劲足、行动快、成绩大的单位和个人，表扬鼓励；对消极畏难、行动迟缓的，批评教育。
    白腊区队从党支部书记到每个干部、党员，都以身作则，走在抗旱的最前列。支部书记孙崇武每天天不亮，就率领着抗旱突击队，带着工具，到最艰苦的地段战斗。他不仅和社员一样劳动，还专挑最重的活路做。当社员休息时，他在一旁向大家进行宣传鼓动，激发群众抗旱的热情。社主任谭祖轩，看到晚稻秧苗和红苕苗嫩弱，经受不住烈日的照射，跑回家去把床上的席子、被单拿出来搭起棚子遮盖苗床。社员受到极大鼓舞，提出：保苗如保命，个个都献宝。全区队社员立即拿出二百九十多件席子用来保护秧苗；同时，还天天淋水，使四十多亩红苕苗床，在严重干旱威胁下，生长茁壮。在干部的模范行动带动下，少数抗旱信心不够的社员，也积极投入战斗。一队社员熊复庭最初认为“人和天斗，十有九输”，行动非常被动。随后他看到由于积极抗旱，硬是收到很大成效，他的态度大变，争先恐后地和社员们一道车水抗旱，他说：“只要大家都展劲，救一块、是一块，这回准赢！”
    7月16日下了一场小雨，部分社员开始松劲。党支部马上开会，耐心说服群众，继续鼓干劲，不获全胜，决不收兵；接着掀起了抗旱新高潮。全队有四百亩中稻，只有四口平塘能灌几十亩，其余没有水源保证。党支部领导社员苦战一昼夜，抢修了十五条堰沟，引水灌田一百二十五亩。同时，充分利用抗旱工具，安排劳力轮班车水戽水，人停工具不停。这样，经过坚苦奋战，保证了全部中稻正常的抽穗扬花。对于没有出天花的三十二亩玉米，除了松土、浇水、施肥外，每个窝子还插上一些带叶的树枝，遮阴抗旱。
    新民区队每个劳动力负担的耕地和白腊区差不多，水利条件比白腊区还要好些，除有四口平塘外还有一座水库能灌溉大部稻田。旱象开始发生时，区队干部麻痹大意，认为有水灌田，问题不大。公社党委发出的紧急抗旱通知，区队党支部书记只在一次干部会上顺便说了一下，没作具体安排，更没有立即行动。随后，当旱象越来越凶，情况变得严重时，他们又惊慌失措，失去信心，认为“灾害太大了，抗也无用。”后来，在公社党委一再督促下，组织群众开始抗旱时，遇到7月16日下了一阵小雨，他们又停了下来。二队一组刚由三十多个人组织起来的抗旱队，都调去搞其他活路，停止了抗旱斗争。就这样，由于领导不力和犹豫动摇，坐失良机，使旱情扩大，造成严重损失。结果全队七十一亩晚稻秧苗、红苕苗干死40％，四百五十多亩晚玉米干死一百五十多亩，四百多亩中稻田都干裂了口，抽穗扬花都很困难。
    最近，铁桥公社党委对新民区队干部的右倾畏难思想进行了批判，并组织他们到白腊区实地参观。新民区队的干部参观回来后，立即组织群众，重整旗鼓，决定学习白腊区的“人定胜天”精神，掀起抗旱斗争的高潮。　（本报记者  刘宗棠）
