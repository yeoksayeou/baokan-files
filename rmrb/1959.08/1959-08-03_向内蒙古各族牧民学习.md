    Learn from the Herdsmen of All Nationalities in Inner Mongolia
    In 1959, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region achieved brilliant results in animal husbandry production: the region increased its stock of young cattle, horses, sheep, and other animals by 7.65 million head, an increase of 2.1 million head more than the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; pig production increased by 5% compared with the same period last year; and various poultry developed to more than 9 million. The enormous achievements of animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia powerfully demonstrate to people that animal husbandry can also achieve a Great Leap Forward. The commendable and congratulatory aspect of Inner Mongolia's Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry also lies in the fact that they have created a relatively complete set of successful experiences in developing animal husbandry production. This set of experiences is a treasure for all pastoral areas and can also be used by agricultural areas as a reference in developing animal husbandry production.
    The reason why Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry has been able to achieve such great achievements, in addition to the fact that the autonomous region has strengthened the Party's leadership over animal husbandry production and implemented the Party's mass line in organizing animal husbandry production, is mainly due to the following two points: one is the comprehensive implementation of the "water, grass, breeding, improvement, management, prevention, shelter, tools" eight measures for increasing production and protecting livestock; and the other is the reduction of livestock consumption rates and the increase in the rate of propagation and survival.
    The so-called "water, grass, breeding, improvement, management, prevention, shelter, tools" eight measures for increasing production and protecting livestock are: developing water conservancy, solving feed and forage problems, improving propagation and survival rates, improving breeds, improving feeding management, preventing and controlling livestock diseases and preventing disasters such as wolf disasters, animal and rat infestations, building sheds and pens to establish stables, and reforming tools. Each of these measures is a problem that must be solved in the development of animal husbandry, and they are interconnected and indispensable. In order to make livestock grow fat and strong, and develop more and better, it is not enough to have grass and feed without water, and it is even more impossible to have water without grass and feed; with water, grass, and feed, if the feeding management is not good, and attention is not paid to the prevention and control of livestock diseases and the prevention of various disasters, livestock will still not grow well, and the survival rate and propagation rate will not be high.... Only by comprehensively implementing these measures can outstanding results be achieved in increasing production and protecting livestock. It can be said that these eight measures are the crystallization of the long-term experience of the herdsmen of Inner Mongolia. Learning from these experiences can develop our animal husbandry more, faster, better, and more economically. Of course, any advanced experience cannot be mechanically copied; we can only grasp its spirit and apply it flexibly according to local conditions.
    This year, in the development of animal husbandry production, the herdsmen of Inner Mongolia have also adopted the practice of using a portion of vegetables, fresh eggs, and poultry to replace a portion of meat, in order to reduce the rate of livestock consumption. On the one hand, they actively propagate, increase the rate of propagation and survival, and strengthen measures to increase production and protect livestock; on the other hand, they slaughter and consume less, and naturally the rate of livestock propagation and conservation has been unprecedentedly improved. This year, the herdsmen of Inner Mongolia ate less meat, and in the future they can eat more. The principle is very simple. If the propagation rate and survival rate are high, but the slaughter rate and consumption rate are also high, then in a certain period of time, there will inevitably be only young livestock and no strong livestock, which is detrimental to the development of animal husbandry and the people's lives. On the contrary, if we "treat a good year as a bad year", and eat a little less now, then when the livestock develop more and grow fatter and stronger, we can gradually eat more. Inner Mongolia's experience has proved that reducing the rate of consumption is a key to the current development of animal husbandry. It is hoped that other regions can also proceed from the overall situation, appropriately take care of immediate and long-term interests, appropriately reduce the rate of livestock consumption, and increase the rate of propagation and conservation.
    Now, the herdsmen of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia are launching a new upsurge in animal husbandry production to strive for a greater harvest next year under the slogan of "Celebrating the harvest, boosting morale, adding one more head of livestock, and adding one more share of wealth for the country." Let us wish them a greater harvest next year, and at the same time hope that all regions will learn from their experiences! Short Commentary

    向内蒙古各族牧民学习
    1959年度，内蒙古自治区的畜牧业生产获得了辉煌的成绩：全区增殖了牛马羊等各种仔畜七百六十五万头，比大跃进的1958年度还多增殖二百一十万头；生猪生产比去年同期增长了5％；各种家禽发展到九百多万只。内蒙古畜牧业的巨大成就，有力地向人们证明了：畜牧业同样可以大跃进。内蒙古畜牧业大跃进的成就所以可喜可贺，还在于他们在发展畜牧业的过程中，创造了一套比较完整的成功经验。这套经验是所有牧区的财富，也可供农业区在发展畜牧业生产中借鉴。
    内蒙古畜牧业所以能够取得这样巨大的成就，除了自治区在组织畜牧业生产中，加强了党对畜牧业的领导，贯彻执行了党的群众路线以外，最主要的有这样两条：一是全面地贯彻了“水、草、繁、改、管、防、舍、工”八项增产保畜措施；一是减少了牲畜消耗率，提高了增殖率和成活率。
    所谓“水、草、繁、改、管、防、舍、工”八项增产保畜措施，就是发展水利、解决饲草饲料、提高繁殖率和成活率、改良品种、改善饲养管理、防治牲畜疫病和防止狼灾兽鼠害等灾害、盖棚搭圈建立厩舍、工具改革。这些措施，每一项都是发展畜牧业中必须解决的问题，而且是互相关连的，缺一不可。要使牲畜长得又肥又壮，发展得又多又好，光有草有料没有水不行，有水没草没料更不行；水、草、料都有了，要是饲养管理得不好，不注意防治牲畜疫病和防止各种灾害，牲畜仍然长不好，成活率、繁殖率都不会高……。只有全面地贯彻了这些措施，才能在增产保畜方面取得优异成绩。可以说，这八项措施是内蒙古牧民多年来经验的结晶。学习这些经验，就可以多快好省地发展我们的畜牧业。当然，任何先进经验，都是不能生搬硬套的，只能掌握其精神实质，根据本地具体条件灵活运用。
    今年，在发展畜牧业生产中，内蒙古的牧民还采取了用一部分蔬菜、鲜蛋、家禽等代替一部分肉食，以降低牲畜消耗率的作法。一方面积极繁殖，提高繁殖率和成活率，加强增产保畜措施；一方面又少宰杀、少消耗，自然牲畜的增殖率、保育率就空前提高了。今年内蒙古的牧民少吃了一部分肉食，将来就可以多吃。道理很简单，如果繁殖率、成活率高，宰杀率、消耗率也同样的高，在一定时期内势必出现只有仔畜而无壮畜的情况，这对畜牧业的发展和人民的生活都是不利的。相反，如果“丰年当做歉年过”，现在少吃一点，等到牲畜发展得更多，牲畜也长得更肥壮了的时候，就可以逐渐多吃。内蒙古的经验已经证明：减少消耗率是当前发展畜牧业的一个关键。希望其他地区也能从全局出发，适当地照顾眼前利益和长远利益，适当地降低牲畜消耗率，提高增殖率和保育率。
    现在，内蒙古各族牧民又在“庆丰收，鼓干劲，多增加一头牲畜，多为国家增添一分财富”的口号下，掀起了争取明年更大丰收的畜牧业生产新高潮。让我们预祝他们明年获得更大的丰收，同时希望各地学习他们的经验！短　评
