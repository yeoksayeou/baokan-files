According to a report in the Hubei Daily, "Relying on the masses can overcome difficulties, and relying on the masses can conquer drought!" This is the most profound lesson that Luo Chunfu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Jin Kou Production Team in Jinshui Commune, Wuchang County, Hubei Province, has learned in leading the masses in the fight against drought.

The drought resistance struggle of the Jin Kou Production Team started with early rice. After twelve rounds of water lifting to combat the drought, the 972 mu of early rice achieved a bumper harvest of 550 jin per mu. On this basis, the team has also achieved a comprehensive victory in the struggle against drought for mid-season rice, single-season late japonica rice, and double-season late rice. Currently, more than half of the mid-season rice has been irrigated five times, and the rest has been irrigated three times or more; all 78 mu of single-season late japonica rice has been watered, and the rest have also adopted drought prevention measures, using methods such as covering with wheat husks and bean leaves, and loosening the soil to preserve moisture, according to their specific conditions; all 410 mu of double-season late rice have also been completely planted after fighting drought and rushing to transplant.

Not Bowing to Difficulties, Taking the Lead
The Jin Kou Production Team area is a 7-li long stretch of loess hills with the worst water conservancy conditions. In addition, there has been no rain since July, and the ponds and dams have little water left. Some cadres and masses were not mentally prepared for whether they could overcome the drought and ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest. Party Branch Secretary Luo Chunfu thought: Since the early rice drought resistance had achieved a bumper harvest, why couldn't they guarantee an autumn harvest? He raised this question at the branch meeting and decided to resolutely rely on the masses to carry out the drought resistance struggle. Luo Chunfu took the lead in going to the tenth team, which had the most difficult conditions and the most severe drought. This team had 11 mu of mid-season rice that were all on terraced fields, and because of the difficulty in obtaining water, it required four water wheels to lift the water to the ridge. The team only had two water wheels, so the members did not plan to pump water. Luo Chunfu, on the one hand, convinced the masses by calculating the costs and benefits in detail and repaired the two water wheels; on the other hand, he worked with the masses day and night to pump water, staying on the front line for more than twenty days. Sometimes, when he returned from a meeting in the management area, it was already twelve o'clock at night, and he was still repairing the drought resistance tools, and the next day he still pumped water with the masses. Under the influence of his hard-working style, all 21 laborers in the team were投入了抗旱斗争, and finally relieved the threat of drought to the 11 mu of mid-season rice.

Consulting Experienced Farmers, Encouraging the Masses
In the drought resistance struggle, Luo Chunfu deeply realized the importance of the mass line. He often visited the members' homes, and discussed any difficulties or problems with the members. The drought in the second team was serious, and by mid-July they had not yet completed the double-season rice transplanting plan. After discovering this situation, he went to consult with the experienced farmers Zhou Jiawang and Lei Jingchen. Based on the fact that there was a lot of rain in the early stage and little rain in the later stage this year, the old farmers proposed the suggestion of "moving" the double-season rice, that is, draining the water from the lake fields and replanting the late rice, which solved the difficulty of not being able to transplant rice in the ridge fields due to lack of water. After studying this suggestion, Luo Chunfu immediately promoted it and solved the problem of replanting twelve mu of double-season rice. From the beginning of July to the present, he has visited more than fifty old farmers and young and middle-aged members through individual visits and small-scale forums, researched and adopted more than 20 rationalization proposals from the masses, and solved many important problems in drought resistance. For example, based on the experience of the old farmers and the favorable conditions after the people's commune, he researched a set of comprehensive drought prevention and resistance measures such as "changing water," "covering," "loosening soil," "moving homes," "going to the lake," and "borrowing fields," which solved the water use problems for ensuring the harvest of mid-season rice, ensuring the seedlings of single-season late japonica rice, and transplanting double-season late rice.

In the drought resistance struggle, Comrade Luo Chunfu also knew how to use various forms to carry out publicity and mobilization work and meticulous ideological education among the masses. He often led the propaganda and慰问 team to be active on the drought resistance construction site, working with the drought resistance army while using drum lyrics, fast boards, and other forms to publicize various policies and the deeds of advanced individuals and advanced units to the masses, encouraging the fighting spirit of the masses. After hearing the propaganda team tell about the model deeds in the drought resistance struggle of the third team, Wang Rongfa and Chen Xianzao, members of the first team who originally lacked confidence in drought resistance, immediately held a battlefield meeting with other members in the fields and decided to catch up with the third team. Lei Jinbao, a member of the tenth team, had doubts about the grain policy and was unwilling to resist the drought. Luo Chunfu visited him at his door, explained the grain policy to him, and cleared Lei Jinbao's mind, making him actively投入 the drought resistance struggle and put forward three rationalization proposals.

Caring for the Lives of the Masses, Personally Grasping Heat Prevention and Cooling
"The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the lives of the masses." Comrade Luo Chunfu often kept in mind the Party's instructions and cared about the lives of the masses. He personally grasped the work of preventing heatstroke and cooling down and the welfare of the members. In addition to the original one nursery and three canteens, the team has recently restored six busy farming nursery groups and nine canteens. The canteen of the fourth team had not been established for a long time, so he personally went to the team to visit the members and found that 19 of the 20 households in the team requested to set up a canteen, but the team cadres were unwilling to do so because they were afraid of "the iron pot being on top." He patiently persuaded the team cadres and helped them establish the canteen. At the water pumping construction site, whenever the members rested, he would carry the tea bucket and take heatstroke prevention medicine to each water pumping pier to send tea and medicine to each member. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. In this drought resistance effort, 76 advanced individuals emerged from the team. (Attached picture)

    金口队党支部书记罗春甫工作作风深入细致
    和群众拧在一起抗天灾争丰收
    据湖北日报消息　“依靠群众，就能克服困难，依靠群众，就能战胜旱灾！”这是湖北省武昌县金水公社金口生产队党支部书记罗春甫，在领导群众抗旱斗争中体会最深刻的一点。
    金口生产队的抗旱斗争是从早稻开始的。经过十二次车水抗旱，使九百七十二亩早稻获得了单产五百五十斤的丰收。在此基础上，又取得了中稻、一季晚粳和二季稻全面抗旱斗争的胜利。现在，一半以上的中稻已经灌了五次水，其余都灌水三次以上；七十八亩一季晚粳都车了水，其余也都采取了防旱措施，分别情况采用麦壳、豆叶覆盖和松土等办法保墒；四百一十亩二季晚稻也全部抗旱抢插完毕。
    不向困难低头　自己带头上阵
    金口生产队一带，是绵延七华里长的黄土岗地，水利条件最差。加上7月以来滴雨未下，塘堰剩水不多。能不能战胜旱灾，保证全面丰收，一部分干部和群众没有思想准备。党支部书记罗春甫想：既然早稻抗旱取得了丰收，为什么不可以保证秋季丰收？他把这个问题提到支部会议上讨论，决定坚决依靠群众开展抗旱斗争。罗春甫首先带头到条件最困难、旱情最严重的十小队去。这个小队有十一亩中稻都是塝田，因为水源困难，需要四转车才能把水引上岗，队里只有两部水车，社员就没有打算车水。罗春甫一方面通过算细账，打通群众思想，修好了两部水车；一方面日夜和群众一道车水，坚持了二十多天没下火线。有时他在管理区开完会回来，已经是夜里十二点，他还在修整抗旱工具，第二天仍和群众一道车水。在他这种艰苦勤劳的作风影响下，全小队二十一个劳动力全部投入了抗旱斗争，终于使十一亩中稻解除了干旱威胁。
    向老农请教　给群众鼓气
    在抗旱斗争中，罗春甫深刻体会到群众路线的重要意义。他经常到社员家中访问，有什么困难问题就同社员商量。二小队旱情严重，到7月中旬还没有完成二季稻插秧计划。他发现这一情况后，就去请教老农周家旺、雷敬臣。老农根据今年前期雨多后期雨少的情况，提出了二季稻“搬家”的建议，即把湖田的渍水排出，复晚，解决了垅田无水不能插秧的困难。罗春甫研究了这个建议后，就马上推行，解决了十二亩二季稻的复晚问题。从7月初到现在，他用个别串门、小型座谈等方式，先后访问了五十多个老农和青、壮年社员，研究、采纳群众的合理化建议二十多条，解决了抗旱中的许多重要问题。例如他根据老农的经验，和人民公社化后的有利条件，研究出了“改水”、“覆盖”、“松土”、“搬家”、“下湖”、“借田”等一套全面防旱、抗旱措施，解决了中稻保收、一季晚粳保苗和二季晚稻插秧的用水问题。
    在抗旱斗争中，罗春甫同志还善于利用多种形式向群众进行宣传鼓动工作和细致的思想教育。他经常带着宣传慰问队活跃在抗旱工地，一边和抗旱大军同劳动，一边运用鼓词、快板等形式向群众宣传各项政策和先进人物、先进单位的事迹，鼓舞群众的斗志。一小队社员王荣发、陈贤早原来对抗旱信心不足，听了宣传队讲述三小队抗旱斗争中的模范事迹后，立即和其他社员在田头开了战地会议，决心赶上三小队。十小队社员雷金保对粮食政策有怀疑，不愿抗旱。罗春甫就登门拜访，向他讲解了粮食政策，打通了雷金保的思想，使他积极投入抗旱斗争，并提出了三条合理化建议。
    关心群众生活　亲抓防暑降温
    “群众干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。”罗春甫同志经常记住党的指示，关心群众生活。他亲自抓防暑降温和社员福利工作。全队除原有的一个托儿所和三个食堂外，最近又恢复了六个农忙托儿组和九个食堂。四小队食堂迟迟没建立起来，他便亲自深入到这个小队访问社员，发现全小队二十户社员有十九户要求办食堂，只是因为小队干部怕“铁锅顶头”不愿办。他便耐心打通了小队干部的思想，帮助把食堂建立了起来。在车水工地上，每当社员休息时，他就挑起茶桶，带着防暑药品，到各个车水埠头，给每个社员送茶送药。这样，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。在这次抗旱中，全队涌现了七十六个先进人物。（附图片）
