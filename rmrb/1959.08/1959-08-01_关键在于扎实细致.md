　　The news that two production brigades in Tanziqiao Commune, Hengnan County, adopted different approaches in promoting new tools and achieved different results once again proves that promoting the use of new tools is an important way to solve the current shortage of rural labor.

　　The cadres of the Liantang Brigade did thorough and detailed work and learned that the masses were not unwilling to use new tools, but rather had opinions about certain parts of the new tools. After the cadres consulted with the masses and improved the tools together, the new tools played a full role in the tense agricultural activities. The cadres of the Shengli Brigade, upon hearing the opinions of the masses, did not conduct in-depth investigation and analysis, and simply put the new agricultural tools away.

　　From the successful and failed examples of these two brigades, it can be seen that further promotion and use of new tools in the vast rural areas is not a simple matter. The creation of each new tool always has characteristics that meet the needs of local cultivation. When it is appraised and widely promoted, it still needs to undergo some improvements and enhancements to adapt to the conditions and needs of other regions. If solid and detailed work is not done, and some "minor shortcomings" and "minor problems" of the tools that are not adapted to the conditions of the region are not resolved, they will become major obstacles. Therefore, it is not feasible to think that new tools can be promoted by relying on a site meeting and issuing a call. Only by adopting a correct attitude and correct method to promote new tools, like the leading cadres of Liantang Brigade, who have firm confidence in the promotion of new tools and believe in the superiority of these new tools, while not being satisfied with general appeals in the specific promotion, but rather conduct in-depth, detailed, and comprehensive understanding of the opinions of the masses, and rely on the masses to solve specific problems, can the effect be seen immediately.

    关键在于扎实细致
    衡南县谭子桥公社的两个大队，在推广新工具中采取不同的做法，收到不同效果的消息，又一次证明推广使用新工具，是解决当前农村劳动力不足的一个重要办法。
    莲塘大队的干部深入细致地做了工作，了解到群众不是不愿意用新工具，只是对新工具某些部件不好有意见。当干部和群众商量，共同改进以后，新工具在紧张的农事活动中充分发挥了作用。胜利大队的干部一听到群众有意见，不进行深入的调查和分析，便把新农具收了起来。
    从这两个大队成功和失败的事例中可以看出，在广大农村进一步推广和使用新工具，并不是一件简单的事情。每一件新工具的创造，开始总是具有适合本地耕作需要的特点，经过鉴定、大量推广的时候，还需要经过若干改进和提高，才能适应另外一些地区的条件和需要。如果不做扎实、细致的工作，不解决工具上若干不适应本地区条件的“小缺点”、“小问题”，就会成为大障碍。因此，依靠一个现场会议号召一下，就以为新工具可以推广开来的想法是不行的。只有像莲塘大队领导干部那样，对新工具的推广既有坚定的信心，相信这些新工具的优越性；在具体推广时，又不满足于一般号召，而是深入、细致、全面地了解群众意见，并依靠群众解决具体问题。用这样一种正确的态度、正确的方法来推广新工具，其效果自然会立竿见影。
