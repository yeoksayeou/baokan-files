Improving Enterprise Management and Tapping Production Potential
Shanghai's Paper Production Steadily Rises

(Our newspaper Shanghai, 31st dispatch) Shanghai's twenty-plus paper mills, in the movement to strive for high yield, high quality, increased production, and conservation, have universally strengthened enterprise management, and paper production and quality are steadily rising. The city's daily paper production in the first half of July has increased from more than 500 tons in the first half of June to more than 600 tons. In recent days, it has consistently remained above 700 tons. The quality of paper, especially industrial paper, also improved to varying degrees in July compared to June.

Shanghai's paper-making industry's task for the third quarter is more than 40% higher than the second quarter. To achieve this goal, in late June, the Municipal Paper Industry Company conducted a comprehensive analysis of the production situation in the first half of the year. It was discovered that the enterprise management work of many paper mills could not keep up with the development of production, which is a weak link in the current increase in paper production. For example, the machine operating rate, which is one of the signs of the level of enterprise management, should generally reach more than 22 hours per day, but most factories have not done a good job in equipment maintenance and management, so they can only maintain it at around 20 hours per day, and some factories are even less than 20 hours. In addition, many factories have not achieved economic indicators such as paper yield.

Based on this situation, the Municipal Paper Company decided to focus on grasping the source of raw materials on the one hand, and vigorously grasp the management of enterprises on the other hand in the third quarter. It requires all factories to immediately take measures to improve management and increase paper production around the three major indicators of operating rate, paper machine efficiency, and paper yield. At the end of June, China Paper Company mobilized the masses to check the factory's production situation and found that the main shortcomings in the current production are the large number of equipment accidents. Therefore, among the eight paper machines in the factory, only two could operate for 21 hours a day on average in June, and three were below 20 hours. All the factory's employees, from workshops, sections, and groups, found many reasons for the accidents and comprehensively revised the operating procedures and equipment maintenance system, which greatly reduced the accidents. In mid-July, the operating rates of the three paper machines all exceeded 23 hours, four were above 22 hours, and the paper machine efficiency also reached more than 99%.

While strengthening enterprise management, the production potential of many factories has been tapped. The Guofeng Paper Mill is a factory with very unbalanced equipment capacity. The cooking capacity is half the pulping capacity, and the pulping capacity is half the paper machine capacity. In the past, the paper machine was often used to accommodate the pulping, and the pulping was used to accommodate the cooking, so the output could not be increased. Now they have adopted an active balancing method, with the output based on the capacity of the paper machine. They have adopted many management methods that are adapted to the current production situation in the weak links of cooking and pulping. They sent two cadres and established contacts with more than ten fraternal factories, and prepared the raw materials in advance. As soon as that factory's cooking pot or pulping machine was available, they seized the opportunity to use the production gaps of fraternal factories to cook materials and pulp, so that the equipment of other factories and their own factory could be fully utilized, and the paper production also increased from more than ten tons a day to about twenty tons.

Several paper mills, such as Tianzhang, Tianfeng, and Dachina, abolished some necessary production management systems last year. Now, according to the new production conditions, they are mobilizing the masses to revise them, and the paper output has increased by an average of 20% to 50% compared with the past. The paper yield of more than 70 paper machines in the city has increased from about 93% in the past to more than 95% in July, reaching the national standard.

Regarding quality issues, the factories are contacting the chemical departments to obtain chemical raw materials as early as possible, master the raw material composition, and improve the allocation, and strive to further reduce the dust content of paper and further increase the tensile strength of paper in the third quarter.

    改进企业管理  挖掘生产潜力
    上海纸张产量稳步上升
    本报上海31日电　上海二十多家造纸厂在争取高产优质增产节约运动中，普遍加强了企业管理工作，纸张的产量质量稳步上升。全市纸张的日产量7月上半月已经从6月上半月的五百多吨提高到六百多吨。最近几天，一直保持在七百吨以上。纸张的质量，特别是工业用纸7月份比6月份也有不同程度的提高。
    上海造纸工业第三季度纸张的任务比第二季度提高40％以上。为了实现这个指标，6月下旬，市造纸工业公司对上半年的生产情况进行了全面的分析。发现不少纸厂企业管理工作跟不上生产的发展，是当前增产纸张中的一个薄弱环节。例如作为企业管理水平高低标志之一的机台运转率，按一般要求应该达到每天二十二小时以上，但大部分工厂设备检修维护的管理工作没有做好，因此每天只能保持在二十小时左右，有些工厂甚至还不到二十小时。另外如成纸率等经济指标，很多工厂也都没有达到。
    根据这一情况，市造纸公司确定在第三季度一方面继续抓原料材料来源，一方面大抓企业的管理工作，要求各厂立即采取措施，围绕着运转率、抄造率、成纸率三大指标，改进管理工作，增产纸张。中国版纸公司6月底发动群众检查本厂生产情况，发现当前生产上主要的缺点是设备事故较多。因此，全厂八台纸机中，6月份平均只有两台每天能够运转二十一小时，有三台都在二十小时以下。全厂职工从车间、工段、小组分头找出了许多造成事故的原因，全面修订了操作规程和设备检修制度，事故大大减少。7月中旬，三台纸机运转率都超过二十三小时，有四台在二十二小时以上，抄造率也达到99％以上。
    在加强企业管理的同时，许多工厂的生产潜力纷纷被挖掘出来了。国丰造纸厂是一个设备能力很不平衡的工厂，蒸煮能力比打浆能力小一半，打浆能力又比纸机能力小一半。过去往往以纸机去迁就打浆，以打浆去迁就蒸煮，产量提不高。现在他们采取积极平衡的办法，产量以纸机的能力为准，蒸煮、打浆这两个薄弱环节上，采取了许多适应当前生产情况的管理方法。他们派了二个干部和十多个兄弟厂建立了联系，并且把原材料事先作好充分准备，一待那个工厂蒸球、浆机有空，就见缝插针，利用兄弟厂的生产空隙蒸料打浆，使别的厂和自己厂的设备都得到了充分利用，纸张产量也从过去十多吨一天提高到二十吨左右。
    天章、天丰、大中华等几家造纸厂，去年破掉了一些必要的生产管理制度，现在根据新的生产条件，都在发动群众重新修订，纸的产量都比过去平均提高两成到五成。全市七十多台造纸机的成纸率，7月份已从过去的93％左右提高到95％以上，达到了国家规定的指标。
    关于质量问题，各厂正在同化工部门联系，及早取得化工原料，掌握原料成分，改进配分，力争在第三季度纸张的尘埃率进一步降低，纸张的拉力进一步提高。
