    Crabs are generally bundled by the sales staff during sale. Selling crabs is special in that customers often help with the bundling. This not only delays the customer's time but also dirties their hands. If they are not careful, they may be pinched. If it's a small customer, the salesperson is also embarrassed. Now, the season for fragrant chrysanthemum crabs is approaching. Here is an introduction to a good tool for selling crabs - the crab binding clamp. Its structure is very simple. The whole component includes only a base, two wooden pillars, and two steel wires. With it, the salesperson only needs to put the crabs selected by the customer into the steel wire clamp one by one, and bundle them with hemp rope like regular commodities.

    This crab binding clamp is one of the inventions created by employees of the Beijing Zan'anchu Department Store during the technical innovation campaign. (Attached picture)

    捆螃蟹夹
    一般商品出售都是由售货员包扎的，惟有卖螃蟹特殊，经常得顾客帮着捆扎。这对顾客来讲，既耽搁时间，又弄脏了手，偶一不小心，还可能被螯一下。如果遇上小顾客，售货员也很为难。现在，菊香蟹肥的季节又快到了。这里介绍一件出售螃蟹的好工具——捆螃蟹夹。它的构造非常简单，全部部件只有一个底座，两根木柱和两根钢丝。利用它，售货员只要把顾客挑好的螃蟹，一一放入钢丝夹中，像对待一般商品一样，用马连草一捆就行了。
    这个捆螃蟹夹是北京市暂安处商场职工在技术革新运动中创造发明之一。（附图片）
