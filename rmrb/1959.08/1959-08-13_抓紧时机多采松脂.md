　　Seize the Opportunity to Collect More Pine Resin
　　By People's Daily Commentator
    Pine resin is the raw material for rosin production. Now is the peak season for resin tapping. Therefore, seizing the opportunity to collect more pine resin is a decisive move to ensure the completion or over-fulfillment of this year's rosin production task. The amount of rosin produced in August and September directly affects the production of paper, soap, paint, matches, pharmaceuticals, rubber, plastics, and other industrial products in the fourth quarter. If rosin cannot be supplied on schedule, it will affect the planned development of these industries. This is an important task currently facing rosin-producing areas and relevant departments.
    Since entering the peak resin tapping season, rosin production has improved significantly due to the attention of local Party committees and the efforts of relevant departments. In July, the number of people going up the mountains to tap resin doubled compared to the end of June, and the output of pine resin and finished rosin products has also increased significantly. However, it still cannot meet the needs of the country. Due to the rapid development of various industries in China, the amount of rosin needed this year is very large. To complete this year's rosin production task, further efforts must be made. The main problem in rosin production now is the shortage of raw materials (pine resin). As long as there is pine resin, it can be quickly processed into rosin needed for industrial production. In order to ensure the completion of the rosin production task and meet the needs of relevant industrial production, all localities should attach importance to the work of pine resin tapping.
    Grasping the peak resin tapping season, arranging sufficient labor, and launching a vigorous campaign to tap resin is the key to ensuring the completion of the rosin production task. Resin tapping during the peak season is not only more efficient, but also produces more resin, generally 10%-20% more than other seasons, and the quality of the tapped resin is also better. Counting from today, there are still about eighty days of the peak resin tapping season. All areas with resin tapping tasks should seize this favorable opportunity, mobilize the masses, and properly arrange labor, striving to complete all or most of this year's resin tapping task during this period. Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan and other provinces (regions) are the main rosin producing areas in China, and the rosin production tasks of these provinces account for more than 85% of the national rosin production task. It is particularly important for the major producing areas to seize these eighty days of the peak resin tapping season and tap a large amount of resin.
    In order to continuously provide raw materials for rosin production, in addition to a concentrated resin tapping campaign, organizing professional teams to carry out year-round resin tapping is an important measure to ensure the completion of the rosin production task. The climate in the southern provinces of China is mild, and year-round resin tapping can generally be carried out. With fixed workers, professional teams engaged in year-round resin tapping can greatly improve resin tapping techniques. At the same time, they can improve tools and continuously increase labor productivity. For example, professional resin tapping teams in Guangdong and Fujian provinces tap an average of 5,000 jin per person per year (eight months of resin tapping), with the highest reaching 15,000 jin, which is one and a half to two times more than temporary resin tapping workers. Organizing professional teams for year-round resin tapping in the main producing areas can save a large number of temporary resin tapping laborers due to skilled techniques and high production efficiency. For example, if each of the main producing areas such as Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan has a professional team of about 10,000 people, that is, the country has a professional resin tapping team of 50,000 to 60,000 people, after a short period of training and production practice, they can top the use of 120,000 to 150,000 laborers. Rosin production is a long-term production task. Therefore, a group of long-term resin tapping backbone forces, combined with the appropriate combination of mass peak season resin tapping, can reliably guarantee China's rosin production. Forest farms, logging yards, rosin factories processing near the mountains, and people's communes in major rosin producing areas can draw a certain number of laborers according to their specific circumstances to organize professional resin tapping teams.
    Resin tapping should be closely integrated with forest management and forest harvesting, implementing resin tapping before harvesting. Pine forests that need to be harvested within one or two years can adopt intensive resin tapping and chemical resin tapping methods. Forest trees that have undergone intensive resin tapping are also easier to harvest due to the large outflow of liquid from the trunk.
    In addition, timely processing of tapped pine resin can reduce volatilization and improve rosin quality. While meeting the needs of existing rosin processing, the main producing areas should also establish small rosin factories on the spot based on the principle of small-scale processing near the mountains for timely processing. The benefits of processing near the mountains are: saving transportation, high output, good quality, and low cost.
    Party committees at all levels in rosin producing areas should strengthen their leadership over resin tapping and rosin processing production, which is the fundamental guarantee for completing the task. Under the unified leadership of local Party committees, forestry, commercial and relevant industrial departments in all localities should seize the peak season, seize the opportunity, collect more pine resin, and increase rosin production.

　　抓紧时机多采松脂
　　本报评论员
    松香生产的原料是松脂，目前正是采割松脂的旺季，因此，抓紧时机多采松脂，对保证完成或超额完成今年松香生产任务具有决定性的一着。8、9月的松香生产的多少，还直接影响着第四季度造纸、肥皂、油漆、火柴、制药、橡胶、塑料等工业产品的生产，如果松香不能按计划及时供应，就要影响到这些工业有计划的发展。这是摆在各松香产区和有关部门当前的一项重要工作任务。
    自从进入采脂旺季以来，由于各地党委的重视和有关部门的努力，松香生产已有显著好转，7月份上山采脂的人数较6月底增加了一倍，松脂产量和松香成品也有很大增加。但是仍然不能满足国家的需要。由于我国各项工业的迅速发展，今年所需要的松香数量很大，要完成今年的松香生产任务，还必须进一步努力。现在松香生产的主要问题是原料（松脂）不足，只要有松脂很快就可以加工制成工业生产中所需要的松香。为了保证完成松香生产任务，满足有关工业生产的需要，各地对采割松脂的工作应重视起来。
    抓住采脂旺季，安排足够劳力，大力突击采脂，是保证完成松香生产任务的关键。旺季采脂不仅劳动效率高，而且产脂多，一般比其他季节可多出脂10％—20％，采割下来的松脂质量也好。从今天算起采脂的旺季还有八十天左右，凡是有采脂任务的地区，都应该抓紧这个有利的时机，发动群众妥当安排劳力，争取在这一期间内完成今年全部或大部采脂任务。广东、福建、江西、广西、湖南、四川等省（区），是我国松香的主要产区，这些省区的松香生产任务占全国松香生产任务的85％以上，各主要产区如何抓紧这八十天的采脂旺季，大量采脂，尤为重要。
    为源源不断地给松香生产提供原料，除突击采脂外，组织专业队，开展常年采脂，是保证完成松香生产任务的一项重要措施。我国南方各省气候温和，一般都可进行长年采脂。专业队常年采脂，由于工人固定，采脂技术可以大大提高，同时可以改良工具，不断提高劳动生产率，如广东、福建省的专业采脂队每人每年（采脂八个月）平均采五千市斤，最高的达一万五千市斤，较临时的采脂工人多一倍半到二倍。主要产区组织专业队常年采脂，由于技术熟练，生产效率高，可以节省大批临时采脂的劳力。如广东、福建、江西、广西、湖南、四川等主要产区，每省有一万人左右的专业队，即全国有五万到六万人的采脂专业队，经过短期的训练和生产实践，即可顶十二万到十五万劳动力使用。松香生产是一项长期的生产任务，因此，有一批长年的采脂骨干力量，与群众性的旺季突击采脂的恰当结合，就可使我国的松香生产得到可靠保证。凡松脂主要产区的林场、伐木场、靠山加工的松香厂和人民公社都可根据具体情况抽调一定数量的劳力，组织采脂专业队。
    采割松脂应与森林经营和森林采伐密切结合，实行先采脂后采伐，在一、两年内需要进行采伐的松林，都可采取强度采脂和化学采脂的办法采割，经过强度采脂的林木，因树干内液体大量溢出，还便于采伐。
    此外，对采割的松脂及时加工，可以减少挥发，提高松香质量。在满足现有松香加工的同时，主要产区还应本着小型为主靠山加工的原则，就地建立小型松香厂及时加工。靠山加工的好处是：节省运输力，产量高，质量好，成本也低。
    松香产区的各级党委应加强对采割松脂和松香加工生产的领导，这是完成任务的根本保证。各地的林业、商业和有关工业部门应在当地党委的统一领导下，抢旺季，抓时机，多采松脂，增产松香。
