Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 13th: TASS correspondent Ozerov reports that the American people are weary of the frequent tensions in the international situation. They hope to permanently eliminate the danger of devastating war. This is why Americans unanimously approve of the proposal for Soviet and U.S. government leaders to visit each other. Statements by American politicians and social activists, newspaper commentaries, and countless letters from American citizens published in newspapers all illustrate this point. All of this almost completely drowns out the rhetoric of those who advocate the "Cold War," oppose improving relations between the two countries, and attempt to spread distrust about whether the mutual visits of the two leaders can achieve positive results.

    The "New Milford Times," published in New Milford (Connecticut), conducted a poll in the city regarding the visit of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to the United States. After summarizing their opinions, the newspaper pointed out, "The citizens of New Milford warmly welcome the visit of Russian Premier Khrushchev to the United States, believing it to be a measure for better mutual understanding between the two countries, which will bring great hope to people for the establishment of lasting world peace."

    Eighteen-year-old Kemin, in the "Chicago Tribune," called on the United States to "respect Mr. Khrushchev and entertain him cordially." Kemin said, "This visit and Eisenhower's return visit could be the prelude to world peace."

    The Detroit "News" quoted 59-year-old Eskandalin, who works in a shoe factory in Detroit. Eskandalin, who the newspaper described as a typical middle-class American, said: "It is a good thing that Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev can meet and talk." He said, "In the end, what good is war? A large number of people will die. What does that prove? If talks and mutual visits help maintain peace, then I am all for it."

    A reader of the "New York Post," Klein, believes that "the President has a good opportunity. Negotiations with Khrushchev can reduce disagreements and conclude a permanent agreement to stop nuclear weapons testing."

    The "Capital Times" reported that a poll in Madison showed that the vast majority of residents welcomed the mutual visits of Khrushchev and Eisenhower. The newspaper said that similar results were obtained in polls conducted in other cities in the United States. The newspaper emphasized, "This shows that the American people urgently desire peace."

    The "Des Moines Register" also said in an editorial: "This mutual visit will bring a new atmosphere to Soviet-American relations. The people of these two countries, like the people of all other countries, are filled with great enthusiasm and hope, because the leaders of two competing countries will visit and talk to each other. This high-level mutual visit is the most promising event that excites all good people."

    苏美首脑互访有助于维护和平
    美国普通人民一致赞许
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：塔斯社记者奥泽罗夫报道，美国人民对经常紧张的国际局势感到厌倦。他们希望永远消除毁灭性战争的危险。这就是美国人一致赞许苏美两国政府首脑相互访问这个主张的原因。美国政治家和社会活动家的发言、报纸的评论以及美国公民在报上发表的无数封信件都说明了这点。这一切几乎完全把鼓吹“冷战”、反对改善两国关系并且企图对两国领导人相互访问是否能取得积极结果散布不信任气氛的论调压下去了。
    新密尔福（康涅狄格州）出版的“新密尔福时报”就苏联部长会议主席访美一事在这个城市进行了民意测验。报纸概括了他们的意见之后指出，“俄国总理赫鲁晓夫将到美国访问一事受到新密尔福市民的热烈欢迎，他们认为这是两国更好地互相了解的一个措施，这将给人们对建立世界持久和平带来很大希望”。
    十八岁的凯明在“芝加哥论坛报”呼吁要美国“尊重赫鲁晓夫先生和殷勤招待他”。凯明说，“这个访问和艾森豪威尔的答访能够成为世界和平的序幕。”
    底特律“新闻报”引述了在底特律一家制鞋厂工作的五十九岁的埃斯干达林的话。这个被报纸称为典型的中等美国人的埃斯干达林说：“艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫先生能够相晤面谈，这是一件好事”。他说：“归根结底，战争有什么好处呢？大量的人要死掉。这说明什么呢？如果会谈和相互访问有助于维护和平，那我双手赞成。”
      “纽约邮报”的一位读者克莱因认为，“总统有了很好的机会。同赫鲁晓夫的谈判可以减少分歧和缔结永久停止试验核武器的协议。”
    “首府时代报”报道，在麦迪逊举行的民意测验表明，绝大部分居民欢迎赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔相互访问。这家报纸说，在美国其他城市举行的民意测验也得到同样的结果。报纸着重指出，“这表明美国人民迫切希望和平”。
    “得梅因纪事报”也在社论中说：“这次相互访问将使苏美两国关系中出现新气氛。这两个国家的人民也和其他各国的人民一样充满着很高的热情和希望，因为两个彼此竞赛的国家的领导人将相互访问和会谈。这种高级的相互访问是使一切善良人们感到兴奋的最有希望的事件。”
