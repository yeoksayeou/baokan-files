Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 4th. In Heilongjiang Province, nearly one million farmers are currently rushing to harvest spring wheat every day, ensuring victory over the current unsettled rainy weather and achieving a bumper harvest of spring wheat. Tens of thousands of government cadres, urban residents, military personnel, and school teachers and students are also participating in the harvest.

Since July 20th, most areas of Heilongjiang Province have experienced several days of heavy rain. Various localities have put forward the slogan "Concentrate forces, compete with the rain for grain, ensure quality and quantity, and bring every grain into the granary," rushing to harvest wheat day and night during good weather. Various localities are promoting the spirit of large-scale collaboration, adopting collaborative measures such as "communes with small wheat harvesting areas supporting communes with large areas" and "highland areas supporting lowland areas" to ensure timely harvesting before the rain. At present, six counties, including Bayan, Wuchang, Shuangcheng, Suihua, Mishan, and the Duerbote Mongolian Autonomous County, which started earlier, have completed their wheat harvest.

During the wheat harvest, all localities are cutting, transporting, and threshing simultaneously, and are also assigning quality, people, livestock, time, and tasks to ensure the quality of the wheat harvest. A professional team of 130,000 people in the Songhua River area is gleaning wheat ears in the harvested fields, and has so far gleaned 688,000 mu of wheat fields, recovering more than 184,000 jin of wheat.

While harvesting wheat, various localities are also carrying out plowing and replanting simultaneously. The province has plowed 150,000 mu of wheat fields and replanted more than 100,000 mu with flax and autumn vegetables. (Attached picture)

    同阴雨天气作顽强斗争
    黑龙江农民抢收春小麦
    新华社哈尔滨4日电　黑龙江省各地现在每天都有近一百万农民在抢收春小麦，保证战胜当前阴雨不定的天气，使春小麦丰产丰收。数以万计的机关干部、城市居民、部队官兵和学校师生也参加了抢收。
    7月20日以来，黑龙江省大部分地区都下了几天大雨，各地提出“集中力量，与雨争粮，保质保量，颗粒归仓”的麦收口号，赶好天气披星戴月地抢收小麦。各地发扬大协作的精神，采取“麦收面积小的公社支援面积大的公社”，“岗地支援洼地”等协作措施，保证雨前适时收割。目前，行动较早的巴彦、五常、双城、绥化、密山、杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县等六个县已经结束了麦收。
    各地在麦收中都是随割、随拉、随打，并且定质、定人、定畜、定时、定任务，保证麦收工作的质量。松花江专区十三万人组成的专业队伍，在割完的地上拣麦穗，目前已经拣了六十八万八千亩麦地，多收了十八万四千多斤小麦。
    各地在麦收中同时进行了翻地、复种。全省已翻出十五万亩麦田，复种亚麻和秋菜十万多亩。（附图片）
