Strengthening Leadership, Arranging Labor
Anhui Seizes the Time to Pick and Process Summer Tea

(Reported by this newspaper) To strive for summer tea surpassing spring tea, and to achieve the requirements of more harvesting, faster harvesting, good harvesting, and sufficient harvesting, tea-producing areas in Anhui Province have comprehensively launched summer tea picking, processing, and purchasing work. As of July 29, the province had purchased more than 110,000 dan of various types of summer tea; the purchase volume in July increased steadily, and the average daily purchase volume in early July increased by more than 40% compared with the average daily purchase volume in mid-to-late June.

In order to effectively carry out summer tea production and procurement work, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions, emphasizing that tea is one of the main export commodities of Anhui Province and is also the main source of income for people's communes in tea areas. The instructions required the first secretaries of Party committees from the county to the commune and team levels in key tea-producing areas to personally lead the summer tea picking and processing work, rationally arrange labor forces, establish and improve specialized teams for tea picking, primary processing, and tea garden management to ensure timely picking and processing of summer tea, timely weeding and fertilization; general tea areas should also have a Party committee secretary or member in charge, arrange sufficient labor to pick and process summer tea in a timely manner; at the same time, it is necessary to carry out the movement of "picking and processing high-quality and high-yield tea according to people, time, and location," and conduct timely evaluations to encourage the enthusiasm of commune members for production.

Party committees at all levels in the tea areas have earnestly implemented the instructions of the provincial committee and made arrangements at all levels. In addition to convening a telephone conference to implement the instructions, the Wuhu Prefectural Committee decided to establish tea production command headquarters (offices) from the prefectural committee and county committee to the commune committee, and adopt a production responsibility system of "leaders dividing lines, labor dividing industries, tasks assigned to teams, management assigned to groups, measures assigned to gardens, responsibilities assigned to individuals, mutual cooperation, inspection, and acceptance," and carry out competitions between communes and teams, organize large-scale investigations and comparisons, and launch a vigorous mass movement. The entire prefecture is now ushering in a vigorous upsurge of summer tea production. Qimen County adopted the "three grabs" method of grabbing labor in the morning, grabbing quality at noon, and grabbing results in the evening. The number of people working in the county for picking and processing has increased from more than 16,000 at the end of June to more than 33,000. The Lu'an Prefectural Committee requires an average of one person to pick tea per mu of tea garden. Recently, the number of tea picking laborers in the entire prefecture has increased from more than 52,000 at the end of June to more than 70,000.

Under the leadership of the Party committees, commercial departments in various tea-producing areas have generally increased the number of mobile purchasing groups, adopting the method of going to teams, households, and primary processing factories to comprehensively carry out summer tea procurement, thereby accelerating the progress of procurement.

    加强领导　安排劳力
    安徽抓紧采制夏茶
    本报讯　安徽省各产茶区为了力争夏茶超春茶，实现多收、快收、收好、收足的要求，全面开展了夏茶采制和收购工作。到7月29日止，全省已收购各类夏茶十一万多担；7月份收购量步步上升，7月上旬平均日收量比6月中、下旬平均日收量增长40％以上。
    为了切实做好夏茶生产和收购工作，中共安徽省委最近曾发出指示，强调指出茶叶是安徽省主要出口物资之一，也是茶区人民公社收入的主要来源。指示要求各重点产茶区从县到社、队，党委的第一书记都要亲自领导夏茶采制工作，合理地安排劳动力，建立与健全茶叶采摘、初制、茶园管理专业队，保证夏茶及时采制、及时除草施肥；一般茶区也要有一个党委书记或委员负责，安排足够劳力，及时把夏茶采制下来；同时要开展“因人、因时、因地优质高产采茶制茶”运动，及时进行评比，以鼓励社员生产积极性。
    茶区各级党委都认真贯彻了省委指示，层层作了部署。芜湖地委除召开了电话会议进行贯彻以外，并决定从地委、县委到公社党委成立茶叶生产指挥部（所），采取“领导分线、劳动分业、任务到队、管理到组、措施到园、责任到人、互相协作、检查验收”的生产责任制，开展社与社、队与队之间的竞赛，组织大查大比，大搞群众运动。现在全专区正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的夏茶增产热潮。祁门县采取了早上抓劳力、中午抓质量、晚上抓效果的“三抓”办法，全县出勤采制劳力已从6月底的一万六千多人增加到三万三千多人。六安地委要求平均每亩茶园要有一个人采茶，最近全专区采茶劳力由6月底五万二千多人增加到七万多人。
    各产茶区商业部门在党委的领导下，普遍增设流动收购组，采取串队、串户、串初制厂的办法，全面开展夏茶收购，因而加快了收购进度。
