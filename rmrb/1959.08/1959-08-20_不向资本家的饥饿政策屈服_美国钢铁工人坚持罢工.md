　　Refusing to Yield to the Capitalists' Starvation Policy
　　American Steel Workers Persist in Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: The starvation policies and conspiracies of American steel monopoly capitalists cannot intimidate the half a million American steel workers who are persisting in their strike struggle. The major strike in the American steel industry, which began on July 15th, has entered its sixth week.
    American steel trusts continue to reject the workers' reasonable demands. They are conspiring to prolong the strike, causing workers to starve, in order to force them to submit. The chairman of the United States Steel Corporation, Blough, completely ignores the union's demand that he participate in negotiations. Labor-management negotiations in New York remain at a standstill.
    The impact of the steel strike on the American economy is expanding. According to official figures, the U.S. industrial production index fell by two points in July, from 155 in June to 153 (with the average for 1947 to 1949 as 100). The operating rate of the American steel industry was 90% in June, but fell to 44% in July due to the strike, and has fallen to 12% in early August. Moreover, the longer the strike drags on, the longer it will take to restore full production. A one-month strike will take two weeks to bring the steel production operating rate to 85%. A two-month strike will take six weeks to fully restore production. Industries closely related to the steel industry, such as coal mining, railways, shipping, and construction, have been increasingly affected. Since the steel workers' strike began, American railway companies have seen a weekly income reduction of $40 million due to reduced freight volume.
    The U.S. government cannot ignore the prolonged impact of the major steel strike. U.S. President Eisenhower specially returned to the White House from his country villa on the 18th to listen to Labor Secretary Mitchell's report on the strike situation. According to U.S. news agencies, the U.S. government is studying ways to stop the strike.
    Steel workers face many difficulties in their lives during the major strike. According to American newspapers, steel workers lost a total of $208 million in wages in the first two weeks of the strike. Many workers face the prospect of being unable to pay their installment debts. The union can only issue strike relief funds to those workers who are in particular difficulty. Now, the queues of striking workers and unemployed workers waiting to receive relief funds outside the doors of relief agencies in many states are getting longer and longer. However, steel workers have not succumbed to the difficulties created for them by the capitalists. A spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America denied on the 14th the rumors fabricated by the bourgeois press that workers were planning to lower their wage demands, and stated that steel workers are determined to persist in the strike struggle.
    "Worker's Weekly" published an editorial last weekend calling on American workers to support the major steel workers' strike by all means. "Worker's Weekly" emphasized that "the striking steel workers need and deserve the help of the entire labor movement in this struggle against the monopoly capitalists; the monopoly capitalists are acting on behalf of the entire Wall Street in this anti-union movement." The editorial called on American local unions and ordinary union members to show the striking steel workers that "they will thoroughly support them with food, money, and other means."
    In addition, the AFL-CIO New York City Central Labor Council has called on unions in New York City to hold a march and demonstration on September 7 (Labor Day in the United States) to support the steel workers' strike.

### 不向资本家的饥饿政策屈服　美国钢铁工人坚持罢工

　　不向资本家的饥饿政策屈服
　　美国钢铁工人坚持罢工
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：美国钢铁垄断资本家的饥饿政策和阴谋诡计吓不倒坚持罢工斗争的五十万美国钢铁工人。从7月15日开始的美国钢铁业大罢工已经进入第六周。
    美国钢铁托辣斯继续拒绝工人的合理要求。他们阴谋使罢工拖长，工人挨饿，来迫使工人屈服。美国钢铁公司董事长布劳完全不理睬工会要他参加谈判的要求。在纽约举行的劳资谈判继续陷于停顿状态。
    钢铁罢工对美国经济的影响正在扩大。据官方数字，美国7月份工业生产指数下降了两点，从6月份的一五五下降到一五三（以1947年到1949年的平均数为一百）。美国钢铁业开工率6月份是90％，7月份由于罢工下降到44％，到8月初已降为12％。而且，罢工拖得越长，将来恢复充分生产的时间就越长。罢工一个月，要花两星期才能使钢铁生产开工率达到85％。罢工两个月，将要花六个星期才能充分恢复生产。同钢铁工业有密切关系的煤矿、铁路、航运和建筑业已受到越来越大的影响。自从钢铁工人罢工以来，美国各铁路公司由于货运减少每星期收入减少四千万美元。
    美国政府不能不考虑钢铁大罢工旷日持久的影响。美国总统艾森豪威尔18日特地从他的乡间别墅赶回白宫听取劳工部长密契尔关于罢工情况的汇报。据美国通讯社透露，美国政府在研究制止罢工的办法。
    钢铁工人在大罢工中生活是有不少困难的。据美国报刊报道，罢工头两周钢铁工人就损失工资共二亿零八百万美元。不少工人面临付不起分期付款债务的局面。工会只能给那些特别困难的工人发罢工救济金。现在，在许多州的救济机构的大门外等待领救济金的罢工工人和失业工人的队伍已经越来越长了。但是钢铁工人并没有在资本家给他们制造的困难面前屈服。联合钢铁工人工会的发言人14日否认资产阶级报纸捏造工人打算降低工资要求的谣言，并且表示钢铁工人决心坚持罢工斗争。
    “工人周报”在上周末发表社论，号召美国工人用一切办法支持钢铁工人的大罢工。“工人周报”强调指出，“罢工的钢铁工人在反对垄断资本家的这场斗争中需要并且值得整个劳工运动的帮助，垄断资本家在这个打击工会的运动中是代表整个华尔街行事的”。社论要求美国地方工会和普通工会会员向罢工的钢铁工人表明，“他们将以食物、金钱和其他方式来彻底支持他们”。
    另外，产联—劳联纽约市中央劳工委员会已经呼吁纽约市各工会在9月7日（美国劳工日）举行游行示威来支持钢铁工人的罢工。
