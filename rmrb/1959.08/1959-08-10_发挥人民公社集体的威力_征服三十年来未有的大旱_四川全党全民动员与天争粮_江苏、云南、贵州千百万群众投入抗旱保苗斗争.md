Sichuan Province Mobilizes the Entire Party and All the People to Wrest Grain from the Heavens.
Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces Mobilize Millions to Join the Struggle to Combat Drought and Protect Seedlings.

Sichuan

(This newspaper Chengdu, August 8th) The entire party and all the people in Sichuan Province are fully mobilized to fight against the unprecedented drought of the last twenty to thirty years and have achieved a great victory. The drought-affected areas in the province have been reduced by more than half compared to two months ago. The areas where the drought has initially been eliminated are again filled with new greenery; in areas where the drought has not yet been eliminated, work is underway to combat drought, protect seedlings, and rush planting.

Since the beginning of summer, rainfall in Sichuan Province has been scarce. According to statistics from seven regions, the rainfall in early July was less than one-seventh of the normal rainfall. This year, Sichuan has been affected by a large area of drought, affecting 75 counties in 13 regions and cities. These areas have a population of 40 million and more than 60 million mu of cultivated land, of which more than 50% are more severely affected. The drought has lasted for a long time, in some areas for several months. The drought has caused serious damage to agricultural production. In Wanxian Region, more than 60% of the drought-affected rice fields have cracked due to water shortage, and most of the dryland crops have withered and curled leaves; in Jiangjin Region, 55% of the rice fields are dehydrated, and more than 200,000 mu of corn have died in five counties. Due to climate imbalance, other natural disasters such as floods, waterlogging, wind, hail, and pests and diseases are also more serious than in the past.

After the drought occurred, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately grasped the leadership of the drought resistance struggle, made full use of favorable conditions, actively mobilized the masses, and went all out to overcome the disaster. Responsible cadres of the Provincial Committee also went to drought-affected areas to help local areas launch the drought resistance struggle.

The more serious the drought, the more determined the struggle. The people of Sichuan Province have continuously pushed the drought resistance struggle in Sichuan Province to a climax. In Mianyang County, Mianyang Region, nearly 200,000 drought resistance troops have been mobilized in the past three months, trying every means to find water and divert water to irrigate more than 99,500 mu of farmland, using wheat bran, fine sand, and dry manure to cover more than 59,000 mu of cracked rice fields, rushing to plant 150,000 mu of sweet potatoes, and irrigating more than 100,000 mu of various dryland crops, ensuring that more than 90% of the seedlings did not die. The masses in Wanxian Region used various methods such as finding dragon caves, intercepting streams and blocking flows, opening canals to divert water, and using waterwheels to water drought-affected crops by 750,000 mu in three days. In Jiangjin Region, the area of drought resistance and seedling protection in July reached more than 2.4 million mu, generally watered more than twice, and as many as four times. In Fuling Region, more than 21,000 water sources were found in five days.

In order to make up for the losses caused by the drought, areas that have not been affected by the drought and areas that have been affected by the drought are taking "five planting" (increasing, supplementing, changing, interplanting, and intercropping) measures, focusing on expanding late autumn crops, and vigorously carrying out the movement to increase planting. The planned planting area of late autumn crops in Wanxian, Nanchong, Yibin, and Luzhou Regions alone reaches more than 8 million mu. Mianyang Region, which is the most severely affected by the drought, has planted all the drought-affected cultivated land using the "five planting" method, and it is estimated that the grain lost due to the drought can be basically recovered.

After studying the overall situation of the province recently, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that under the circumstances that the drought resistance struggle has already achieved great victories, the overall situation in the province is still very good. In areas where the drought has been eliminated or the drought is not very serious, as long as the measures to overcome disasters and ensure a bumper harvest are resolutely implemented, the losses from various natural disasters can be compensated. There is still hope for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. However, the drought has not yet been eliminated in 32 counties, and it is even developing in a few counties, so it is necessary to continue to go all out, oppose complacency, and overcome the drought. Areas where the drought has been eliminated should also be vigilant to prevent the recurrence of the drought. The Provincial Committee requires all localities to continue to do a good job in ideological work, focusing on overcoming various natural disasters, firmly establishing the confidence that man will conquer nature, continuing to go all out, and launching a new production upsurge in the province centered on overcoming disasters.

Jiangsu

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 8th: Two million people in Jiangsu have joined the vigorous drought resistance struggle. After a month of hard work, most of the more than 2.7 million mu of middle rice and late rice and more than 4.6 million mu of dryland crops threatened by drought are basically growing normally.

Since July, there has been very little rainfall in Jiangsu Province, and the amount of water coming from the upper reaches of the Huaihe River and the Yangtze River has also been greatly reduced compared with previous years. The water level of the Yangtze River in Nanjing is about one meter lower than in the same period last year. Recently, the temperature has been high and the evaporation has been large. The average daily evaporation in the province has increased by nine millimeters compared with the same period last year.

In the hilly and mountainous areas where the drought is severe, due to the particularly scarce rainfall, more and more reservoirs and ponds have dried up, and there has been a serious shortage of water sources. However, this has not frightened the people in the mountainous areas with strong will. They put forward the magnificent slogans: "Fight the drought until the sky bows its head, protect the seedlings until the grain enters the warehouse!" "A hundred industries exchange for a pound of grain, send water to the mountains, dig springs for irrigation without water, and use the Yangtze River to water when the river is cut off", and launched a heroic struggle against the drought. Members of the Shiqiao Commune in Jiangpu County, a mountainous area, concentrated 850 waterwheels and used the method of people not resting and waterwheels not stopping to continuously draw water day and night across mountains and ridges to irrigate drought-affected crops. The Donghu Brigade of the Lukou Commune in Jiangning County used five waterwheels to draw water from the Qinhuai Lake, which is more than a mile away, to rescue the dried-up rice fields.

In areas with relatively abundant water sources such as Taihu Lake, Lixiahe, Hongze Lake, Luoma Lake, and the Yangtze River banks, planned water use and water conservation are also being fully carried out, making long-term plans for no rain and preventing autumn drought. In the coastal areas of Suzhou and Changzhou Regions, the control and management of coastal sluice gates have been strengthened.

In the drought resistance struggle, leading cadres at all levels have gone to the forefront to participate in and direct the drought resistance.

According to meteorological forecasts, there will still be very little rainfall in Jiangsu in August, and all parts of the province have made preparations for long-term drought resistance.

Yunnan

This newspaper Kunming, August 9th: Millions of people in Yunnan are engaged in a hot struggle against drought, drainage, and pest control. According to recent statistics, the province has been affected by varying degrees of drought on an area of approximately 3 million mu. In the drought-stricken Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, some rice fields have cracked, and dryland crops have withered and shrunk. The entire prefecture has 390,000 people fighting on more than 2 million mu of drought-stricken land. They are determined to recover the 500 million jin of grain lost due to the drought. In Xiangyun County, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan's famous drought-stricken area, 60,000 people have been mobilized to pump water, drain water, carry water, and lift water to rescue severely drought-stricken rice, corn, and cotton.

Leading cadres at all levels in Yunnan Province have gone to the most severely affected and difficult areas to lead the masses in the struggle. The secretaries of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee have gone deep into the people's communes with severe disasters, helping the masses to fight the drought while directing hundreds of thousands of people in the prefecture to fight the drought. The secretary of the Chuxiong County Party Committee led more than 400 cadres, went deep into the disaster areas, and fought side by side with the masses to fight the drought. The county has now repaired and excavated more than 450 water diversion channels, and dispatches 10 water pumps and more than 700 water lifting tools every day. The county has irrigated more than 23,000 mu of fields. Yongshan County, Zhaotong Region, on the banks of the Jinsha River, has just overcome floods and waterlogging disasters and is now facing drought. People of all ages in the Wuji Commune of this county have participated in the drought resistance struggle. More than 4,000 people in the commune have formed more than 200 shock teams to divide the area and contract the drought resistance. After seven days of hard work, more than 3,500 mu of drought-stricken crops have been rescued.

While the western region is suffering from drought, the eastern region of Yunnan Province has experienced waterlogging. In Qujing Region, various crops have been washed away and submerged by floods, reaching 150,000 mu. In Zhaotong Region, 810,000 mu of corn have been waterlogged. When the floods came, institutions from the county to the commune immediately organized flood control agencies to dig ditches for drainage, apply heat fertilizers, and reduce the disaster. Now, most of the waterlogged seedlings have turned green from yellow.

Farmers in Dali, Dehong, and Nujiang Autonomous Prefectures, where insect pests are serious, are vigorously exterminating insects. Baoshan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, has sent agricultural technical cadres to Shidian, Banqiao and other people's communes, which are severely affected by insect pests, to guide the insect extermination battle. By the end of July, it is estimated that more than one million jin of rice borers have been eliminated in Baoshan Dam alone. The area affected by insect pests in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture has also gradually decreased after the struggle.

In order to make up for disaster losses, the broad masses also use the tenacious will of "losing one dou and recovering one shi" to investigate and eliminate wasteland, intercropping, replanting, supplementing planting, expanding planting, and opening up various avenues to increase production.

Guizhou

According to Xinhua News Agency, 4 million people in Guizhou Province have joined the drought resistance struggle, and more than 2 million mu of drought-affected crops have been rescued.

Rice, one of the main food crops in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, is now in the stage of jointing, rounding stems, and heading, which requires the largest amount of water; crops such as corn and flue-cured tobacco also urgently need an appropriate amount of water. However, since July, except for a heavy rain in the western part of Bijie Region, the southwestern part of Anshun Region, and the southeastern part of Qiandongnan Region, there has been very little rainfall in other areas of the province, and the area affected by drought in the mountainous areas has quickly expanded to 6.9 million mu. In areas where drought occurred, drought resistance headquarters (offices) were established in a timely manner under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, headed by the first secretary of the Party Committee. Tongren Region, which is more severely affected by drought, mobilized and organized more than 570,000 people and more than 6,000 cadres to join the drought resistance and seedling protection struggle. The masses in many areas also spontaneously organized drought resistance shock teams, camped in the fields, and fought day and night in shifts.

In the drought resistance movement, tens of thousands of waterwheels were used to form thousands of "water dragons" to draw river water to the fields. Some used the method of layered water lifting to lift river water into the fields to irrigate the seedlings, and more were rushing to repair small water conservancy projects to divert water to irrigate the fields. In addition to taking measures such as plastering field ridges and pouring water to resist drought, Zunyi Region also renovated more than 5,000 small water conservancy projects during the drought resistance. The region has saved more than 220,000 mu of drought-affected rice. Tongren Region has also achieved great results by using methods such as weeding, hoeing, water wheeling, and cutting green grass to cover the fields for drought resistance.

    发挥人民公社集体的威力　征服三十年来未有的大旱
    四川全党全民动员与天争粮
    江苏、云南、贵州千百万群众投入抗旱保苗斗争
    四川
    本报成都8日电　四川省全党全民总动员，同二、三十年以来未有的大旱展开斗争，取得了巨大的胜利，全省受旱地区比两个月前缩小了一半多。旱象初除的地区又是一片新绿；旱象尚未解除地区，抗旱保苗和抢栽抢种工作正在紧张进行。
    入夏以来，四川省雨量稀少，据七个专区统计，7月上旬降雨不及常年雨量七分之一。今年四川受旱面大，先后波及十三个专区和市的七十五个县。这些地区有四千万人口，六千多万亩耕地，其中较严重的占50％以上。干旱时间长，有些地区连续几个月。干旱对农业生产的危害很严重，万县专区受旱的稻田断水开裂达60％多，旱地作物大部衰萎卷叶；江津专区有55％的稻田脱水，五个县有二十多万亩玉米干死。由于气候失调，洪、涝、风、雹等其他自然灾害和病虫害也比以往严重。
    干旱发生后，中共四川省委立即抓紧领导抗旱斗争，充分运用有利条件，积极发动群众，鼓足干劲，千方百计战胜灾害。省委负责干部还到受旱地区，帮助当地展开抗旱斗争。
    旱情越严重，斗争越坚决，四川省人民不断地把四川省抗旱斗争推向高潮。绵阳专区绵阳县近三个月来出动了二十多万抗旱大军，千方百计找水引水灌田九万九千五百余亩，用麦糠、细沙、干粪抢面裂口稻田五万九千余亩，抢栽了红苕十五万亩，浇灌各种旱地作物十余万亩，保证了90％以上的禾苗没有死亡。万县专区群众用找龙洞、截溪堵流、开渠引水、车水、挑水等各种各样办法，三天中浇灌受旱作物七十五万亩。江津专区7月份中抗旱保苗的面积达二百四十多万亩，一般浇水两次以上，多的达四次。涪陵专区五天中找出水源二万一千多处。
    为了弥补干旱带来的损失，没有受旱和受旱的地区以扩大晚秋作物为中心，采取“五种”（增、补、改、间、套）办法，大力开展增种运动。仅万县、南充、宜宾、泸州四个专区规划种植晚秋作物就达八百万亩以上。干旱最严重的绵阳专区用“五种”办法，已把受旱耕地全部种上，估计因旱受损失的粮食基本上可以拿回。
    中共四川省委最近在研究全省情况后认为，在抗旱斗争已经取得巨大胜利的情况下，全省总的形势还是很好的。旱象解除或旱象不很严重的地区，只要坚决把战胜灾害确保丰收的措施贯彻下去，各种自然灾害的损失就可以弥补起来。今年农业生产大丰收仍然是有希望的。但是，还有三十二个县旱象至今尚未解除，少数县甚至还在发展，必须继续鼓足干劲，反对松劲，战胜旱灾。已经解除旱象的地区还要提高警惕，防止旱灾的再度发生。省委要求各地继续深入做好思想工作，以战胜各种自然灾害为中心，坚定人定胜天的信心，继续鼓足干劲，在全省掀起一个新的以战胜灾害为中心的生产高潮。
    江苏
    新华社南京8日电　江苏二百万人投入如火如荼的抗旱斗争。经过一个月来的奋力苦战，遭受干旱威胁的二百七十多万亩中稻、晚稻和四百六十多万亩旱作物，绝大部分生长情况基本正常。
    7月份以来，江苏全省降雨量很少，淮河、长江上游来水量也比往年大大减少，南京的长江水位比去年同期低一米左右。近来气温高，蒸发量大，全省每日平均蒸发量比去年同期增加九毫米。
    在旱情严重的丘陵山区，由于雨水特少，越来越多的水库、塘坝干枯了，水源发生了严重困难。但是，这丝毫没有吓倒具有顽强意志的山区人民。他们提出了气壮山河的口号：“抗旱抗到天低头，保苗保到粮进仓！”、“百工换斤粮，送水上山岗，无水灌溉挖泉水，河里断水车长江”，同干旱展开了英勇的斗争。山区江浦县石桥公社社员集中了八百五十部水车，用歇人不歇车的办法，昼夜不停，翻山越岭引水灌溉受旱庄稼。江宁县禄口公社东湖大队用五道水车从一里多路的秦淮湖盘水抢救干白的稻田。
    在水源比较充沛的太湖、里下河、洪泽湖、骆马湖和长江两岸地区，也在全面开展计划用水、节约用水，作长期不雨打算，预防秋旱。苏州、常州两专区的沿江地区，加强了沿江涵闸的控制管理。
    在抗旱斗争中，各级领导干部都深入到最前线参加和指挥抗旱。
    据气象预测，8月份江苏雨量仍然很少，全省各地已经作好了长期抗旱的准备。
    云南
    本报昆明9日电　云南数百万人的抗旱、排涝、灭虫斗争热火朝天。据最近统计，全省先后不同程度受旱面积约有三百多万亩。旱灾严重的楚雄彝族自治州，有的水田已经干得裂缝，旱地作物枯萎卷缩。全州已有三十九万人在二百多万亩干旱土地上坚持斗争，他们决心夺回因旱灾损失的五亿斤粮食。云南著名的干旱坝子大理白族自治州的祥云县，已有六万人出动抽水、排水、背水和提水，抢救受旱严重的水稻、包谷和棉花。
    云南省各级领导干部都到受灾最严重和困难的地区领导群众进行斗争。楚雄彝族自治州地委的书记们都深入到灾情严重的人民公社，一边帮助群众抗旱，一边指挥全州数十万人向干旱作战。楚雄县县委书记带领四百多名干部、深入灾区和群众并肩抗旱。全县现已修挖了引水渠道四百五十多条，每天出动十台抽水机和七百多部提水工具，全县已灌溉田二万三千多亩。昭通专区金沙江畔的永善县刚战胜洪涝灾害，现又迎战干旱。这个县的务基公社不论男女老少都参加了抗旱斗争，全社四千多人组成两百多个突击小组，划片包干抗旱。经七天苦战，已抢救出三千五百多亩受旱庄稼。
    与西部干旱同时，云南省的东部地区发生了涝灾。曲靖专区已被洪水冲刷淹没各种作物达十五万亩。昭通专区有八十一万亩包谷受涝。当洪水到来时，从县到公社都立即组织起领导抗洪机构，进行挖沟排涝，追施热性肥料，减轻灾情。现在，大部分受涝苗棵已由黄返青。
    在发生虫害严重的大理、德宏、怒江自治州农民，正在大力灭虫。德宏傣族景颇族自治州保山县，已把农业技术干部派到虫灾严重的施甸、板桥等人民公社指导灭虫战斗。到7月下旬，仅保山坝子估计就消灭了螟蛾上百万斤。大理白族自治州受虫灾侵袭面积经斗争以后也逐渐减少。
    为了弥补灾害损失，广大群众还以“损失一斗，找回一石”的顽强意志，查荒灭荒、套种、改种、补种、扩种，广开门路，增加生产。
    贵州
    据新华社讯　贵州全省有四百万人投入抗旱斗争，已抢救受旱作物两百多万亩。
    贵州山区主要粮食作物之一的水稻，现在正在拔节、圆秆、孕穗，是需水量最大的时期；玉米、烤烟等作物，也急需适量水分。但自7月份起，全省除毕节专区西部、安顺专区西南部和黔东南部地区下过一次大雨外，其它地区雨量很少，山区受旱面积很快发展到六百九十万亩。发生旱象的地区，都在党委的统一领导下及时建立了抗旱指挥部（所），由党委第一书记挂帅。旱象较重的铜仁专区，动员和组织五十七万多人和六千多名干部，投入抗旱保苗斗争。不少地区的群众，还自动组织了抗旱突击队，在田间安营扎寨，日夜轮番奋战。
    各地在抗旱运动中，用数以万计的水车结成千百条“水龙”，把河水引到田里，有的用分层戽水法，把河水戽进田里灌苗，更多的是抢修小型水利引水灌田。遵义专区在抗旱中除了采取糊田埂和挑水浇淋方法抗旱外，还整修了五千多处小型水利，全区已挽救受旱水稻二十二万多亩。铜仁专区用薅秧、锄草、车水、割青草盖田等办法抗旱，收效也很大。
