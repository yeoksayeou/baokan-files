Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 13th: Cuban public opinion strongly condemns the U.S. plot to interfere in Cuba through the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers. “Hoy” (Today) published a commentary today, condemning U.S. imperialism for preparing armed intervention in Cuba from the Dominican Republic and (the U.S. state of) Florida, while simultaneously attempting to shift the responsibility for the current turbulent situation in the Caribbean and Central America onto Cuba at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, in order to create a pretext for intervention. The commentary stated that Cuban Prime Minister Castro had said that Cuba would not accept any kind of investigation, and only the Cuban people could decide when and how to conduct elections, and what type of government we want. The commentary emphasized that all Cuban people support the attitude adopted by Cuban Foreign Minister Roa at the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers.

　　“Revolución” (Revolution) and “Calle” (Street) both condemned the U.S. for using Somoza and Trujillo to prepare a "Guatemala incident" against Cuba.

　　“Combate” (Combat) published a commentary accusing U.S. Secretary of State Herter of manipulating the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers. The commentary said that the agenda and outcome of the meeting were already in Herter's briefcase. The newspaper exposed the essence of the Organization of American States as a tool of the United States, saying that the organization's funding is provided by all member states, but until now it has only served the interests of the United States, so a distinguished Mexican diplomat described the organization's meeting as a meeting of "twenty mice and one cat." “Combate” emphasized that if measures against intervention are to be taken at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, then let it start with the United States! Because U.S. intervention is "the most vicious, most shameless, and most historically long-standing intervention."

　　Meanwhile, the National Bar Association of Cuba sent a letter to the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, expressing "strong opposition to any foreign attacks on Cuban sovereignty and independence," and expressing firm support for the revolutionary government.

　　古巴舆论反对美国干涉
　　谴责赫脱操纵美洲外长会议
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴舆论强烈谴责美国通过美洲外长会议干涉古巴的阴谋。“今日报”今天发表评论，谴责美帝国主义在多米尼加和（美国的）佛罗里达州准备武装干涉古巴的同时，企图在外长会议上把目前加勒比海和中美地区不安形势的责任栽到古巴头上，以便制造干涉借口。评论说，古巴总理卡斯特罗说过，古巴不会接受任何种类的调查，只有我们古巴人才能决定应该在什么时候用什么方式进行选举，决定我们愿意要什么类型的政府。评论强调指出，全体古巴人民都支持古巴外交部长罗亚在美洲外长会议上采取的态度。
      “国民报”和“街道报”都谴责美国正利用索摩查和特鲁希略，准备制造一次针对古巴的“危地马拉事件”。
      “战斗报”发表评论指责美国国务卿赫脱操纵美洲外长会议。评论说，会议的议程和结果早就在赫脱的皮包里了。报纸揭露充当美国工具的美洲国家组织的本质时说，美洲国家组织的经费由所有的成员国供给，但是直到现在为止它只为美国的利益效劳，因此墨西哥一名杰出的外交家把这个组织的会议说成是“二十个老鼠和一个猫”的会议。“战斗报”强调指出，如果在外长会议上要采取反对干涉的措施，那么就从美国开始吧！因为美国的干涉“是最恶毒、最无耻、历史最悠久的干涉”。
    同时，古巴全国律师协会向美洲外长会议发出一封信，表示“强烈反对外国攻击古巴主权和独立的任何行动”，并表示坚决支持革命政府。
