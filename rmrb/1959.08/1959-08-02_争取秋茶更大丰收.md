Strive for a Greater Autumn Tea Harvest
By Our Editorial Staff

Following the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in national tea production in 1958, this year's spring and summer tea harvests have also been abundant. The famous Yunnan "Dian Hong" increased production by more than 30% compared to last year; Sichuan's "Chuan Hong" and "Bian Tea" increased by 15% and 25% respectively; Anhui's Liuan "Gua Pian" increased by 17%; and Zhejiang's "West Lake Longjing" even increased by 53.7%. This year's bumper spring and summer tea harvests are the result of the diligent efforts of the vast number of cadres and masses in the tea-producing areas, and the earnest implementation of the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture.

Although the national spring and summer tea harvests have been abundant this year, they are still far from meeting the people's need for tea. The amount of tea consumed by the people has increased annually in recent years. This requires farmers in tea-producing areas across the country to muster even greater efforts, based on the bumper spring and summer tea harvests, and to strive in every possible way to increase autumn tea production even more, in order to meet the people's growing need for tea.

At present, autumn tea production has begun successively in tea-producing areas across the country. Can autumn tea production be greatly increased? Absolutely. From a natural conditions perspective, most of the tea-producing areas in the country are located in subtropical climate zones, with abundant rainfall and mild temperatures. The picking season for autumn tea nationwide is generally about three or four months, which is longer than the combined picking season for spring and summer tea (more than two months). At the same time, the number of flushes and buds in autumn tea is also greater than in spring and summer tea. Spring and summer tea each have one flush, while autumn tea can have two to three flushes. In particular, the abundant rainfall in June and July this year allowed the tea trees to safely pass the "summer drought" hurdle that threatens autumn tea growth, providing more favorable conditions for a large increase in autumn tea production this year. In addition, the fact that autumn tea production has increased in recent years also proves that the potential for autumn tea production is enormous. One of the important measures for Zhejiang Province's rapid increase in tea production in recent years is to tightly grasp the decisive link of increasing autumn tea production. Zhejiang Province only produced 46,000 dan of autumn tea in 1955, but by 1958 it had increased to 200,700 dan, a three-and-a-half-fold increase in three years. If tea-producing areas across the country can grasp the increase of autumn tea production as tightly as Zhejiang Province, then the national autumn tea production can be greatly increased.

How can we achieve a greater increase in autumn tea production this year? Based on the experience of spring and summer tea, the primary issue is to rationally allocate labor and fix a basic team for tea production, to ensure the smooth completion of various production tasks such as picking, processing, and managing during the autumn tea production period. The fact that production has increased in various places proves that the speed of tea production increase is relatively fast in places where there is a professional tea production team. For example, the Chenzhai Production Team of Huangshan Commune in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, established a tea professional team with twelve laborers starting in 1957. In 1958, tea production increased by 1.6 times compared to 1957. This year's spring and summer tea also reported a bumper harvest, with spring tea increasing by 43% and summer tea expected to increase by 60%. The greatest benefit of establishing a professional tea team is to strengthen the sense of responsibility of the commune members in production, ensure the timely implementation of tea garden management, and professionalize tea garden management, tea picking, and tea making.

Maximizing the mobilization of commune members' production enthusiasm is another important factor in ensuring increased autumn tea production. During this year's spring and summer tea season, many tea-producing areas have gained a lot of successful experience in this regard, such as implementing a three-year unchanging responsibility system of contracting production, quality, labor, and cost, implementing "quota management, rewarding over-quota production" and "half work points, half cash payment," and other methods have achieved remarkable results, and these successful experiences should be further promoted during the autumn tea season.

Improving the level of tea garden management and improving the nutritional conditions of tea trees are the key to cultivating more, picking more, and increasing autumn tea production. In particular, we must focus on the following five measures to increase production: ① Vigorously grasp autumn tea garden fertilization; ② Laying and burying grass to preserve soil and resist drought; ③ Intensive cultivation, weeding, and pest control; ④ Careful picking, meticulous harvesting, timely picking and tying, and conscientiously promoting the timely and batch picking of tea according to standards, and leaving fish leaves; ⑤ Improve tea-making technology and improve the quality of raw tea.

At present, autumn tea production has begun in various producing areas across the country, and cadres in the tea-producing areas should go deep into the production teams, into the tea gardens and preliminary processing factories, and strengthen the leadership of autumn tea production. Tea purchasing departments should strengthen the purchasing work of autumn tea. Party organizations at all levels must earnestly grasp autumn tea production, form a strong tea production front from top to bottom, and strive to make greater achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    争取秋茶更大丰收
    本报评论员
    继1958年全国茶叶生产空前大跃进，今年春、夏茶又丰收了。闻名的云南“滇红”，比去年增产三成多；四川的“川红”和“边茶”增产一成五和二成五；安徽的六安“瓜片”，增产一成七；浙江的“西湖龙井”更增产了53.7％。今年春、夏茶大丰收，是茶区广大干部和群众努力经营，切实执行八字宪法的结果。
    虽然今年全国的春、夏茶丰收了，但离开人们对茶叶的需要还很远。人民的饮茶数量，近几年来每年都有提高。这就要求全国各茶区农民在春、夏茶丰收的基础上，鼓足更大干劲，千方百计地争取秋茶更大增产，以适应人民对茶叶不断增长的需要。
    目前全国各茶区的秋茶生产，已经相继开始。秋茶能否大增产呢？完全能够。从自然条件上说，全国茶区绝大部分属亚热带气候区域，雨量充沛，气候温和，全国秋茶的采摘期一般都在三、四个月左右，比春茶和夏茶采摘期的总和（二个多月）还要长。同时秋茶发芽的轮次和芽数也较春、夏茶为多。春、夏茶各发一轮，秋茶可发二至三轮。特别是今年6、7月间，雨水充沛，使茶树安然度过了威胁秋茶生长的“伏旱”关，给今年的秋茶大增产提供了更为有利的条件。此外，几年来秋茶增产的事实也证明：秋茶生产的潜力是巨大的。浙江省近几年来茶叶产量迅速增加，重要措施之一就是紧紧地抓住了增产秋茶这个决定性的环节。浙江省1955年只产秋茶四万六千担，到1958年就已增加到二十万零七千担，三年的时间增长了三倍半。如果全国各茶区都能像浙江省那样抓紧增产秋茶，那么，全国的秋茶产量就可以大大增加。
    怎样使今年秋茶更大增产？根据春、夏茶的经验，首要的问题是合理安排劳动力，固定一批茶叶生产的基本队伍，以保证秋茶生产期间采、制、管各项生产任务顺利完成。各地增产事实证明：凡是有茶叶生产专业队伍的地方，茶叶增产的速度都是比较快的。如浙江诸暨县璜山公社陈宅生产队，从1957年开始建立了一支有十二个劳力的茶叶专业队后，1958年茶叶产量比1957年增产一倍六，今年春、夏茶又告丰收，春茶增产四成三，夏茶预计增产六成。建立茶叶专业队伍的最大好处是加强社员生产的责任心，保证茶园管理的适时进行，使茶园管理和采茶、制茶都专业化起来。
    最大限度地调动社员生产积极性，是保证秋茶增产的又一重要因素。今年春、夏茶期间，许多茶区在这方面取得了很多成功的经验，如推行三年不变的包产、包质、包工、包本责任制，实行“定额管理、超额奖励”和“半记工分、半付现金”等办法，都取得了显著成效，秋茶期间应该进一步推广这些成功的经验。
    提高茶园管理水平，改善茶树营养条件，是达到多培育、多采摘、多增产秋茶的关键。特别要抓紧下列五项增产措施：①大抓秋季茶园施肥；②铺草埋草，保土抗旱；③精耕细作，清园治虫；④精采细收，适时采扎，认真推广按标准及时分批采茶，留鱼叶；⑤改进制茶技术，提高毛茶品质。
    目前，全国各产区的秋茶生产已经开始，茶区干部应该深入生产队、深入茶园和初制厂，加强对秋茶生产的领导。茶叶采购部门要加强秋茶的采购工作。各级党组织要把秋茶生产认真抓起来，从上到下组成一条茶叶生产的坚强战线，争取做出更大成绩，迎接国庆十周年。
