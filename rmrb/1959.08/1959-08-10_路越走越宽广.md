The People's Daily editorial on August 6 pointed out: A right-leaning danger that deserves serious attention has emerged on the economic front.

Right-leaning thought can arise in many situations. One situation is when a high tide is already approaching, but one is still indifferent to the situation, content with the status quo, and stuck in one's ways, thus forming a conservative tendency. This appeared in the rural socialist upsurge of 1956, like those people with bound feet who swayed and wobbled as they walked. Another situation is after the high tide rises, during the ups and downs of the tide, in the face of minor difficulties, one fails to recognize the nature of the difficulties and attempts to retreat in the face of adversity, often forming a situation of insufficient confidence, hesitation, or slow progress.

What is currently emerging is closer to the latter. "This is because a sense of difficulty and slackness has grown among some cadres. They exaggerate certain difficulties in their work, and ignore or underestimate the great achievements already obtained and the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties. They lack confidence in overcoming difficulties, and for tasks that are objectively permissible and can be completed through subjective efforts, they do not make every effort to complete them, but think that the lower the plans and targets, the better, and defend their right-leaning conservative ideas."

The reason why this deserves serious attention is precisely here. Failing to make every effort to complete those things that can be completed will lead to missed opportunities, turning many things that could become reality into nothing. If it even gets to the point of "thinking that the lower the plans and targets, the better," and "pouring cold water on the masses' soaring labor enthusiasm, and deflating the masses' spirit," then this is even more unacceptable.

Difficulties will certainly arise on the road ahead, everyone agrees on this point. The only question is how to view these difficulties, and whether to give full play to subjective initiative to earnestly realize those things that can be done through effort. This is the point of difference between those who have right-leaning sentiments and those who do not.

People who are always full of energy believe that the current difficulties are only temporary and local difficulties on the road of the Great Leap Forward; the conditions for overcoming difficulties now are not worse than in the past, but much better than in the past. Therefore, as long as we implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and fully mobilize the masses, the current difficulties can be completely resolved in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, we are not only not afraid of these difficulties, and do not retreat from these difficulties, but instead meet these difficulties with high morale. Why? Because we see new victories behind these new difficulties. We understand that every time we encounter a new difficulty on the road ahead, this proves that we have moved forward, just like a mountain climber, every time he encounters a new mountain peak, it proves that he has reached a new height. If we do not move forward, we will not encounter new difficulties on the road ahead, but what good would that do? The difficulties in progress are nothing but the landmarks of the progressor's victory.

Within the scope of objectively permissible conditions, whether or not we can do our utmost to obtain the greatest victory depends on whether we can fully exert our subjective initiative. Objective conditions, that is, possibilities, are not always fully prepared, and sometimes need to be promoted and discovered by people. Giving play to subjective initiative can make the same objective conditions yield double the results. The fact that the people of Guangdong were able to recover what the floods had taken after the great disaster, and the people of Henan, Shandong, and other places were able to bring water to dry land, was not due to any magic, but simply because they gave full play to the greatest possibility of human effort, and tapped and utilized the conditions that could be utilized. If they had just waited, all of this would have been in vain. The fact that Beijing's industrial production has been able to exceed production targets month after month and leap forward again and again; that the output of the 140 key coal mines across the country has been able to rise every ten days; and that many factories and mines have exceeded production targets every day in the first few days of August, and are striving to realize the call of "Red at the beginning, red every day, and red all over" is not because they have no difficulties, but because they have criticized the slackening mood and mustered revolutionary zeal. Today, the banners of fighting a great battle in August and September to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day are fluttering and waving all over the country. As long as the troops and horses on all fronts move together and make progress step by step, the difficulties will disintegrate one after another. It should be recognized that the current situation is indeed one of a great leap forward, the conditions are very good, and as long as we can fully muster our energy and give play to people's subjective initiative, we will surely achieve far greater results than at present.

But those who have right-leaning sentiments have not recognized that the difficulties in this advance are temporary and local difficulties, and have not seen the favorable conditions that are far more and greater than the difficulties. They underestimate the great strength of the Party and the people, and underestimate the subjective initiative of people. The favorable situation is relatively vague in their eyes, they have lost confidence in overcoming difficulties, and when they encounter difficulties, they sigh and groan, their legs become weak, and they cannot help but want to retreat. In fact, is retreating less difficult than advancing? People often say: One step is missed, and one is left behind every step, which means that the road of retreat cannot be taken.

Yes, objective conditions should be valued, and objective laws must be followed, but people are not slaves to objective conditions and objective laws after all, and people can recognize and fully utilize objective laws. This is why good and bad crops can be grown on the same land, and different steels can be refined in the same furnace.

The road can only get wider and wider, and difficulties can only disappear after being overcome. This is an irrefutable truth. Here, one must have an indomitable revolutionary will and heroic spirit, and two, one must have a clear mind that is good at observing the situation, and be able to see the essence of the difficulties on the road ahead, and those smooth conditions that are far more and greater than the difficulties. If everyone can do this, the danger of right-leaning will be easily eradicated.

### 路越走越宽广

    路越走越宽广

    人民日报8月6日的社论指出：目前在经济战线上出现了一种值得严重注意的右倾危险。
    右倾思想，在很多情况下都可能产生，一种情况是已面临高潮，对形势却还漠然不察，因此安于现状，故步自封，形成一种保守倾向。这在1956年的农村社会主义高潮中出现过，就是那种摇摇摆摆像小脚女人走路的人。另一种情况是在高潮跃起之后，每乘潮头起伏之间，回旋之际，在小小困难面前，认不清困难的性质，企图遇难而退，往往形成一种信心不足、迟迟不前，或者缓缓向前的情况。
    目前出现的近乎后一种。“这就是一部分干部中滋长了一种畏难松劲情绪，他们夸大工作中存在的某些困难，忽视或者低估了已经获得的伟大成绩和克服困难的有利条件。他们对于克服困难信心不足，对于本来是客观条件许可和经过主观努力可以完成的任务，不去千方百计地努力完成，认为计划、指标越低越好，替自己的右倾保守思想辩护。”
    值得严重注意的原因也就在这里。不去千方百计地努力完成那些可以完成的事情，就会坐失时机，使许多可以成为现实的东西化为乌有。如果竟至于“认为计划、指标越低越好”，而且“对于群众的高涨的劳动热情大泼冷水，泄群众的气”，这就更不应该了。
    在前进的道路上一定会发生困难，大家都承认这一点。问题只在于怎样去看待这些困难，只在于对那些经过努力本来可以做到的事情，是否充分发挥主观能动性，去认真实现它。这便是有没有右倾情绪的人的分歧点。
    经常干劲充沛的人认为，当前的困难只不过是跃进道路上的一些暂时的局部的困难；现在克服困难的条件，不是比过去更差了，而是比过去好得多了。因此，只要贯彻执行党中央的指示，充分发动群众，目前存在的一些困难是完全可以在比较短的时间内得到解决。因此，我们不仅不害怕这些困难，不对这些困难退避，反而斗志昂扬地去迎接这些困难。为什么？因为我们看到这些新的困难的背后就是新的胜利。我们明白，在前进的道路上每遇到一个新的困难，这就证明我们已经向前推移了，就同登山运动员，每遇到一个新的山头，就证明他又达到了一个新的高度是一样的。不前进便不会再遇到前进道路上的新困难，可是，这又会有什么好处呢？前进中的困难不是别的，它只不过是前进者胜利的路标而已。
    在客观条件许可的范围内，能不能极尽人事之能，获取最大的胜利，关键在于能不能充分发挥主观能动性。客观条件也就是可能性，并不都会是万事俱备的，有时要待人去促成，去发现。发挥了主观能动性，可以使同样的客观条件收到加倍的果实。广东人民能在大灾之后，决心夺回洪水抢去的东西，河南、山东等地人民能使旱田获水，并非有什么神术，只是由于发挥了人事的最大可能，挖掘和利用了可以利用的条件。倘使坐待，这些都会化为乌有。北京工业生产，能够月月超产一跃再跃；全国一百四十个重点煤矿产量能够旬旬上升；8月前几天很多厂矿天天超产，并努力实现“开头红、日日红、满堂红”的号召，他们也并非没有任何困难，而是由于批判了松劲情绪，鼓足了革命干劲。如今，大战8、9月迎接国庆十周年的旗帜，在全国到处飘扬招展，只要各个战线上的兵马齐动，节节进展，困难就会纷纷瓦解。应当认清，当前的确是一个大跃进的形势，条件是很好的，只要能够充分鼓足干劲，发挥人们的主观能动作用，一定会获得远比目前更大的成绩。
    但那些带有右倾情绪的人，正是没有认识这种前进中的困难是暂时的局部的困难，更没有看到那些远比困难为多为大的顺利条件。对党和人民群众的伟大力量估计不足，低估了人的主观能动作用。有利形势在他们眼里比较模糊，他们失去了克服困难的信心，一遇到困难便唉声叹气，腿脚发软，不由地便想退避三舍了。其实，退避难道比前进困难少些？人常说：一步踏空，步步落后，也就是说倒退的路走不得。
    是的，客观条件应该重视，客观规律必须适从，但是人究竟不是客观条件和客观规律的奴隶，人能认识和充分利用客观规律。这便是为什么在同样的土地上，能够种出好坏不同的庄稼，在同样的炉子里能够炼出不同的钢的原因。
    路只有越走越宽广，困难只有经过克服才能消失。这是颠扑不破的真理。这里，一要有百折不挠的革命意志和英雄气慨，二要有善察形势的明晰头脑，能够看清前进道路上的困难的实质，和远比困难为多为大的那些顺利条件。人人都能这样，右倾的危险便容易根绝了。
