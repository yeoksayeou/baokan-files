    Jiaoxian People Fight Drought and Rush to Plant Chinese Cabbage
　　Our Reporter　Mu Jiajun
    The nationally famous Jiaoxian Chinese cabbage recently underwent an extraordinary battle. Its hometown, the people's communes of Jiaoxian, Shandong, planted most of it before the Beginning of Autumn. This is a major victory for the people of Jiaoxian in their fight against drought.
    Terrible Midsummer Drought
    To meet the needs of various regions for Chinese cabbage, Jiaoxian had decided to plant a large area of Chinese cabbage this year. It had already planted 200 mu in mid-July, preparing to harvest it and transport it to Beijing for National Day. Unexpectedly, a terrible midsummer drought occurred precisely during the sowing period of the Chinese cabbage. Chinese cabbage can only be sown in the few days around the Beginning of Autumn, generally before the Beginning of Autumn; planting too early or too late will result in poor growth. However, since July 17, most areas of Jiaoxian have not had any rain, and the sun has been blazing every day, with scorching heat. Green leaves have been curled by the sun, and the treetops have been smoking. During the hottest period, three days without rain is a small drought, and five days without rain is a major drought. After half a month without rain, needless to say, even the crops in the fields cannot withstand it, and planting cabbage is even more difficult.
    Precious Jiaobai
    However, Jiaoxian's Chinese cabbage must be planted. Most counties in eastern Shandong produce Chinese cabbage, which is fresh, tender, and famous throughout the country. Jiaoxian Chinese cabbage is the most famous, incomparably fresh and tender, and known as Jiaobai. Its characteristics are large and numerous leaves, few and fine fibers, solid heart, and a round and pointed top, like a thick cannonball. The soup made from Jiaobai is milky white, and the leaves are both sweet and fragrant, making it unforgettable. Jiaobai has always been a precious product among Chinese cabbages, sold far and wide to Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places. This year, the people's communes of Jiaoxian have all decided to launch a high-yield movement for Chinese cabbage: on the one hand, to supply more precious Jiaobai to cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, and on the other hand, to increase income. Could this be abandoned just because the drought makes sowing difficult?
    To Develop, We Must Plant
    In terms of the great development of Jiaobai production, a large area must be planted. It is said that this precious Chinese cabbage has a planting history of more than 500 years, but its development has been very slow. After hundreds of years of development, by the time of the enemy and puppet rule before liberation, Jiaoxian planted less than 6,000 mu of Chinese cabbage, with an average yield of only 5,000-odd jin per mu. After liberation, the Party and the government attached importance to the development of Jiaobai production and took many measures to increase its yield. Thus, in 1957 and 1958, the area planted with Chinese cabbage in Jiaoxian developed to about 15,000 mu, with a total output of nearly 200 million jin; the yield per mu also increased to an average of 13,000 jin, with a maximum of more than 30,000 jin; the largest cabbage weighed more than 60 jin. The large-scale construction of farmland water conservancy in 1958 created favorable conditions for the great development of Jiaobai production. This year is a year of great development and great leap forward in Jiaobai production, so can we not do it?
    In recent years, the seeds of Jiaobai have spread throughout the country. In 1957 and 1958, Jiaoxian transferred several thousand jin of Jiaobai seeds every year, and this year it transferred more than 40,000 jin. Jiaoxian's large-scale planting of Chinese cabbage is also related to the development of Jiaobai production throughout the country.
    Drought Does Not Scare Heroic People
    The Party and the people of Jiaoxian were not frightened by the severe midsummer drought. They were determined to complete the plan of planting a large area of Chinese cabbage under any circumstances. From August 1, under the leadership of the Party, the 15 people's communes of Jiaoxian, giving full play to the soaring spirit of man conquering nature, launched a major battle to combat drought, protect autumn crops, and rush to plant vegetables. After ten days of hard work, the county has diverted and lifted water to irrigate 9,628 mu of drought-stricken autumn crops such as soybeans and sweet potatoes, and rushed to plant 20,529 mu of autumn vegetables. The sowing plan for nearly 30,000 mu of Chinese cabbage has been basically completed.
    In the major battle of rushing to plant vegetables, the communes and production teams summarized the experience of increasing production by fighting drought in 1957, organized visits to drought-stricken crops, calculated production reduction accounts, and inspected and ranked drought-fighting water sources, labor forces, and tools. This played a significant role in boosting the enthusiasm and confidence of the vast number of cadres and masses in overcoming drought and striving for a bumper harvest, and in overcoming the fear of difficulty and the idea of waiting for rain among a few cadres and masses. In a few days, the county repaired and started up more than 6,000 waterwheels, dozens of boiler-trolley machines, and other water-lifting machinery. The county's Industrial Bureau and Commercial Bureau also distributed three water-lifting machines and 356 waterwheels from their inventory. The drought-fighting brigades, drought-fighting groups, and rush-planting groups of various production teams adopted the method of dividing areas, assigning tasks, and contracting responsibilities, and rushed to block rivers, build dams, dig ditches, divert water, irrigate land, and plant vegetables separately, and the movement quickly formed a climax.
    A Major Battle
    On both banks of the Sanli River in the west and south of Jiaoxian City, the fertile fields are open, the villages are dense, and the land is flat and slightly undulating. This area is the birthplace of Jiaobai and is still the concentrated production area of Jiaobai. In the few days before the Beginning of Autumn, the most intense battle of sowing Chinese cabbage was launched here. Under the scorching sun, amidst the chorus of cicadas, and in the fields where the crops were listless from the sun, the members of the Dingjiazhuang, Sanlihe, Youfangtaizi, and other production teams of the Chengguan Commune, men, women, old, and young, all turned out. While the crops were listless from the sun, they were sweating profusely under the scorching sun, fighting with full spirit. The boiler-trolley machine of the Youfangtaizi Production Team roared, and the Liberation-style waterwheels scattered like stars were turning ding-ding-dang-dang on the wells. The combat teams contracting to plant Chinese cabbage, the girls, and the young men were scooping water and watering the land, leveling the land and raising ridges, digging pits, and sowing seeds. Here a team, there a group, launching assaults and competitions.
    Now, the Chengguan Commune has basically completed the plan of fighting drought and rushing to plant Chinese cabbage. In the early-sown cabbage fields, the backs of the flat ridges have already sprouted cute green cotyledons of Chinese cabbage. The National Day cabbage has already grown four or five large leaves, which are even more lovely and green. However, the drought situation in Jiaoxian is still developing, and the battle against drought is also continuing. The Puji, Guhe, and Yinghe Communes are still blocking rivers, digging ditches, and diverting water to irrigate the land; the Sanlihe and other production teams of the Chengguan Commune are also continuing to dig ditches and install water pumps. They are determined to overcome the severe drought, seize a bumper harvest in autumn, and seize a bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage. (Attached picture)

    胶县人民抗旱抢种大白菜
　　本报记者　木家军
    驰名全国的胶县大白菜最近经历了一场不平常的战斗。它的老家——山东胶县各人民公社赶在立秋以前把它大部分种上了。这是胶县人民在抗旱斗争中间取得的一个重大胜利。
    可怕的伏期干旱
    为了满足各地对大白菜的需要，今年胶县早就决定要大种大白菜；并且已经在7月中旬提早种了二百亩，准备在国庆节收获运往北京。真没想到恰恰在大白菜的播种期，遇上了可怕的伏期干旱。大白菜只能在立秋前后几天内播种，一般要赶在立秋以前，过早过晚都长不好。可是从7月17日以来，胶县大部分地区一直没有下雨，天天赤日当空，盛暑炎炎，绿叶晒得卷边，树头晒得冒烟。盛暑时期，三日无雨是小旱，五日无雨是大旱。半月无雨，不用说，连地里庄稼都顶不住，种白菜就更困难了。
    名贵的胶白
    但是，胶县的大白菜却不能不种。山东东部大多数县都盛产大白菜，又鲜又嫩，驰誉全国。胶县大白菜最著名，鲜嫩无比，号称胶白。它的特点是叶片大而且多，纤维少而且细，包心坚实，顶圆而尖，像一枚粗壮的大炮弹。胶白熬出的汤是乳白色的，叶既甜又香，令人入口难忘。胶白一向是大白菜中的名贵佳品，远销北京、上海、香港等地。今年，胶县各个人民公社都决定要大搞大白菜的丰产运动：一方面为了给北京、上海等城市多供应一些名贵的胶白，一方面也为了增加收入。这难道能够因为干旱播种困难就不干了么？
    要发展，不能不种
    就胶白生产大发展来说，也不能不大种。据说这种名贵的大白菜已经有五百多年的种植历史了，可是发展却是很慢的。经过几百年的发展，到解放以前敌伪统治时期，胶县种大白菜还不到六千亩，平均亩产才五千几百斤。解放后党和政府重视发展胶白生产，采取了很多措施来提高它的产量。这样，到1957、1958两年，胶县种大白菜的面积发展到了一万五千亩左右，总产量近二亿斤；单产也提高到平均每亩一万三千斤，最高三万多斤；最大的白菜一棵重六十多斤。1958年大修农田水利，为胶白生产大发展创造了有利的条件。今年是胶白生产大发展、大跃进的一年，难道可以不干么？
    这几年来，胶白的种籽已经传播到了全国各地。1957和1958两年，胶县每年都调出了好几千斤胶白种籽，今年又调出了四万多斤。胶县大种大白菜还关系到全国胶白的生产发展。
    干旱吓不倒英雄的人民
    胶县党和人民没有为严重的伏期干旱吓倒。他们决心在任何情况下都要完成大种大白菜的计划。从8月1日起，胶县十五个人民公社在党的领导下，发挥人定胜天的冲天干劲，展开了抗旱保秋和突击种菜的大战。经过十天的苦战，全县已经引水、提水浇灌了九千六百二十八亩受旱的大豆、地瓜等秋作物，浇水抢种了二万零五百二十九亩秋菜，近三万亩大白菜的播种计划已经基本上完成了。
    在突击种菜的大战中，各公社各生产队总结了1957年抗旱增产的经验，组织参观受旱的庄稼和算减产账，对抗旱的水源、劳动力和工具进行检查和排队，这对鼓舞广大干部和群众战胜干旱争取丰收的干劲和信心，克服少数干部和群众的畏难情绪和等雨思想起了显著的作用。几天之间，全县就把原有的六千多部水车、几十部锅驼机等提水机械修理好，并且开动了起来。县工业局和商业局又把库存的三部提水机械和三百五十六部水车发下去。各生产队的抗旱大队、抗旱小组、抢种小组等等组织，采取了分片、分任务、包干的办法，分头突击拦河、打坝、开渠、引水、浇地、种菜，运动很快就形成高潮。
    一场大战
    胶县城西和城南三里河的两岸，沃野开阔，村庄稠密，土地平坦而微有起伏。这一带就是胶白的发祥地，现在仍然是胶白的集中产区。立秋前几天，这里开展了一场播种大白菜的最紧张的大战。在赤日当空，一片蝉声，庄稼被晒得无精打采的田野上，城关公社丁家庄、三里河、油房台子等几个生产队的社员，男女老幼全体出动了。庄稼被晒得没有精神，他们却在烈日下挥着汗，精神十足地紧张战斗着。油房台子生产队的锅驼机轰鸣着，星罗棋布的水井上解放式水车丁丁当当地转动着。分片包干种大白菜的战斗小组，姑娘们、小伙子们有的在戽水泼地，有的在整地起垅，有的打坑，有的播种。这里一队，那里一组，开展着突击，开展着竞赛。
    现在城关公社基本上已经完成了抗旱抢种大白菜的计划。早播种的白菜田，平整的垅背上已经出现了青翠可爱的大白菜子叶。国庆白菜已经长了四、五片大叶，更是青得可爱。但是，胶县的旱情还在继续发展，抗旱的战斗也在继续展开。铺集、沽河、营河等公社还在继续拦河、开渠，引水浇地；城关公社三里河等生产队也在继续开渠和安装抽水机。他们决心战胜严重的干旱、夺取秋季的大丰收，夺取大白菜的大丰收。（附图片）
