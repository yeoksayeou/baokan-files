Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, in order to organize a major inspection for the autumn patriotic health campaign, issued a notice to the Patriotic Health Campaign Committees of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions on the 18th, requiring all localities to quickly launch the autumn patriotic health campaign and to provide effective leadership.

The notice stated: To promote the health campaign, exchange work experiences, and consolidate the campaign's achievements, all localities should organize a major autumn patriotic health campaign inspection before National Day on the basis of regular inspections.

The notice outlined the key areas of inspection: How do localities incorporate the elimination of the four pests, promotion of hygiene, and eradication of diseases into the agenda when leading industrial and agricultural production and people's commune work? Are the unified arrangements, plans, and measures implemented, and what are the results of their execution? What successful experiences and problems have been encountered, and what are the future plans? Regarding hygiene effectiveness, a detailed understanding is needed of the extent of the elimination of the four pests, the elimination of mosquitoes and flies and the treatment of their breeding grounds, and the progress in eradicating diseases that seriously endanger the people's health. Special attention should be paid to understanding the control of common summer and autumn diseases and the eradication of schistosomiasis and other major parasitic diseases, as well as preparations for the next major winter campaign. Regarding the promotion of hygiene, attention should be paid to issues directly related to the protection of labor power, improvements in environmental hygiene in collective places such as people's communes, construction sites, factories, mines, nurseries, and kindergartens, the cultivation of personal hygiene habits, and the hygiene management and facilities in canteens, the catering industry, and the food industry. The notice requires that special attention be paid to the hygiene work in cities, transportation routes, railways, ports, and other places during the inspection.

The notice stated: To ensure that the inspection work is thorough and detailed, this inspection will be organized by the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions and the collaborating regions themselves, with mutual inspections or participation in each other's inspections. Cities and counties will organize their own inspections within their respective regions. The Ministry of Health, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and the Office of the Central Leading Group for Schistosomiasis Control will, based on the situation, organize personnel to conduct key spot checks separately. The inspection time will be decided by the provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and collaborating regions through their own coordination, but it must be completed within August and September.

The notice pointed out: The inspection work must be carried out under the leadership of the local Party committee, with unified arrangements made in conjunction with production and other central tasks. During the inspection, attention should be paid to grasping the three types of typical examples: good, average, and bad, and timely summarizing and analyzing them to promote the continuous development of the campaign.
