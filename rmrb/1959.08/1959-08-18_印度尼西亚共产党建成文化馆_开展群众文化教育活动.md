Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 16th: The cultural center built by the Indonesian Communist Party in Jakarta held its opening ceremony today. This cultural center will be used to exhibit artworks, hold concerts, and conduct seminars and other cultural activities.

The building of this cultural center was purchased with funds donated to the Indonesian Communist Party by the Indonesian people. It will also serve as the location of the "Aliarcham" Social Science Academy, which was declared established today. This academy is named after Aliarcham, the founder and early theorist of the Indonesian Communist Party, in his memory.

The president of the academy and member of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Hutapea, announced at the ceremony that the two basic principles of the academy are: theory linked with practice; and integration of education and investigation research. He said that the courses in the academy will include political economy, Indonesian history, and will particularly focus on the study of Indonesian revolution and cultural history, world history, and the history of the world workers' movement.

The General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidid, said at the ceremony that in order to express gratitude for the donations of the Indonesian people, the Indonesian Communist Party will not only bring culture and education to the people, but also instruct the party's grassroots organizations to establish work teams to provide voluntary labor for them.

　　印度尼西亚共产党建成文化馆
　　开展群众文化教育活动
    新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚共产党在雅加达建立的一座文化馆今天举行开幕典礼。这座文化馆将用来展览美术品、举办音乐会以及举行座谈会和其它文化活动。
    这座文化馆的建筑是用印度尼西亚人民捐赠给印度尼西亚共产党的款项购买的，它还将被用来作为今天宣告成立的“阿里亚哈姆”社会科学学院院址。这所学院是为了纪念印度尼西亚共产党的创建人和早期的理论家阿里亚哈姆，而以他的名字命名的。
    学院院长、印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会委员胡塔珀阿在典礼仪式上宣布，这所学院的两个基本原则是：理论联系实际；教育和调查研究相结合。他说，学院里的课程将包括政治经济学、印度尼西亚历史，并将特别着重研究印度尼西亚革命和文化史、世界史以及世界工人运动史。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在典礼仪式上说，为了对印度尼西亚人民的捐款表示感谢，印度尼西亚共产党不但要把文化和教育事业带给人民，还要指示党的基层组织成立工作队，为他们进行义务劳动。
