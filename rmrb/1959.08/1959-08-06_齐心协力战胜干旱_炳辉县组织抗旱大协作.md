Working Together to Conquer Drought
Binghui County Organizes Large-Scale Drought Resistance Cooperation

According to the Anhui Daily, Binghui County, Anhui Province, has been promoting a communist style of cooperation in its drought resistance efforts, organizing and planning collaboratively to ensure the comprehensive progress of drought resistance and seedling protection.

The Binghui County Party Committee discovered in a recent inspection that the progress of drought resistance was extremely uneven across different areas. Generally, the progress was faster in polder areas and slower in hilly areas; faster in places with more labor, complete tools, and good water sources, and slower in places with less labor, insufficient tools, and a lack of water sources. Some places, although rivers, lakes, and reservoirs still had a considerable amount of water, faced difficulties due to steep terrain and long distances from the water source, requiring the organization of a large number of laborers to dig irrigation ditches and canals. However, the strength of a single team was limited, which further slowed down the progress of drought resistance. After studying the above situation, the County Party Committee immediately mobilized the masses to carry out planned and organized cooperation in water sources, tools, and labor. On the one hand, the communes strengthened ideological education, putting forward the slogan "Promote the communist style, fight drought together, and cooperate to ensure a good harvest." On the other hand, they organized commune members to conduct in-depth discussions on the issue of cooperative drought resistance, universally calculating the resources of water, tools, and labor, and formulating plans for cooperative drought resistance. All ten communes in the county comprehensively carried out cooperative drought resistance between large teams and small teams. The Wu Tang Commune extracted 1,400 people from 289 small teams in ten large teams including Tushan and Shiying, and concentrated on drought resistance. In just five days, they dug a 7,500-meter-long water diversion canal in the Chuanqiao River Reservoir, which can irrigate 25,000 mu of land. Four large teams along the Tonglong River in Tongcheng Commune jointly established a cooperative drought resistance headquarters, organizing 2,500 people to draw water for irrigation, saving 1,200 mu of seedlings every day. The 600 mu of middle rice in the Erdun production team of the Guozhang Commune was suffering from drought and urgently needed irrigation during the round stem and pregnancy stage. However, the team only had ten waterwheels. At the same time, due to the high terrain, it was necessary to set up three or four stages of wheels to lift the water, and relying solely on the team's strength, it would take 20 days to irrigate all the land once. After mutual consultation, the Huqiao and other production teams transferred 20 waterwheels and 120 laborers to help the team fight drought, saving more than 200 mu of seedlings by waterwheel every day.

When carrying out cooperation, all localities also earnestly implemented the policy of equivalent exchange. Generally, the following three methods were adopted according to different circumstances: First, areas with good water sources, sufficient labor and tools, and less severe drought went to support areas with a lack of water sources, insufficient labor and tools, and severe drought to fight drought. The supported units would pay compensation later. Second, several units sharing the same water source jointly cooperated in drought resistance. Labor-day compensation was calculated based on the size of the benefited area and the amount of labor contributed by each unit. Units with larger benefits and less labor contributed should pay labor-day compensation or exchange labor. Third, those participating in collective well digging, canal construction, and dam construction were compensated according to the benefited area. The units with larger benefits paid labor-day compensation to the units with smaller benefits. This ensured mutual benefit and satisfaction for everyone.

    齐心协力战胜干旱
    炳辉县组织抗旱大协作
    据安徽日报消息　安徽炳辉县各地在抗旱斗争中，发扬共产主义风格，有计划、有组织地进行协作，保证了抗旱保苗工作的全面开展。
    中共炳辉县委从最近的检查中发现：各地抗旱进度极不平衡，一般是圩区快、岗区慢；劳力多、工具齐、水源好的地方快，劳力少、工具不足，缺乏水源的地方慢；有些地方虽然河、湖、水库里还蓄有不少水，但由于地形陡，距水远，需要组织大批劳力开挖行水沟和灌溉渠，而一个队的力量有限，因此，抗旱的进度更加缓慢。县委研究了上述情况以后，立即发动群众，有计划、有组织地开展水源、工具、劳力的协作。各公社一面加强思想教育，提出了“发扬共产主义风格，齐心战干旱、协力保丰收”的口号；一面组织社员就协作抗旱问题进行深入讨论，普遍算了水源、工具、劳力账，订出协作抗旱的计划。全县十个公社，全面开展了大队与大队，小队与小队之间的协作抗旱。吴塘公社从土山、十营等十个大队的二百八十九个小队中，抽出一千四百多人，集中抗旱，仅五天时间，就在川桥河水库开挖了一条七千五百米长的引水渠，可灌田二万五千亩。铜城公社沿铜龙河的四个大队，联合成立了协作抗旱指挥部，组织二千五百人车水灌田，每天可提水救苗一千二百亩。国章公社二墩生产小队受旱的六百亩中稻正在圆秆孕穗，急需灌水，但队里只有十部水车，同时，地势高，需要架三、四盘车才能把水车上来，光靠本队的力量，要二十天才能全部灌一次水；经过互相协商，由护桥等生产队抽调二十部水车、一百二十个劳力帮助这个队抗旱，一天车水救苗二百多亩。
    各地在开展协作时，还认真贯彻了等价交换的政策。一般都根据不同的情况，采取以下三种办法：一，水源好、劳力、工具足，旱象不太严重的地区去支援水源缺乏、劳力、工具不足，旱象严重的地区抗旱，由被支援的单位以后付给报酬。二，同一个水源的几个单位联合协作抗旱，按照各单位受益面积大小和出工多少，计算出工分报酬，受益大，出工少的单位，应付出工分报酬或以工换工。三，参加集体挖井、开渠、打拦河坝的，按受益面积计算报酬，由受益大的单位付出工分报酬给受益较小的单位。做到互相有利，大家满意。
