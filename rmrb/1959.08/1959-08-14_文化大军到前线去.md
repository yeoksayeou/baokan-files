　　Cultural Troops Go to the Front Lines
    The Xiaogan County Cultural Center, ballad team, film team, and other cultural and artistic departments in Hubei Province are going all out to devote themselves to the drought resistance struggle and are extensively carrying out cultural propaganda activities. They have gone deep into the forefront of the drought resistance struggle, and through singing, mobilization posters, honor rolls, competition charts, and other forms, have powerfully promoted drought resistance. In the past, the Heping Production Team of Pengxing Commune could only excavate 1.7 cubic meters of earth per person when opening canals. Through propaganda and mobilization, the work efficiency was greatly improved, with each person averaging 3.5 cubic meters. The canal irrigating 1,400 mu of farmland was originally scheduled to be completed in five days, but it was completed one day ahead of schedule. Xiaogan County also organized folk carving artists to create paper-cut propaganda paintings such as "Are You Fighting the Drought?" and "Look at Our Strength!" to promote the drought resistance movement.　　　　　(Zhang Can)

　　文化大军到前线去
    湖北孝感县文化馆、曲艺队、电影队等文化艺术部门全力以赴投入抗旱斗争，广泛地开展文化宣传活动。他们深入抗旱斗争的最前线，通过演唱、鼓动牌、光荣榜、竞赛图等形式，有力地推动了抗旱。朋兴公社和平生产队开渠道原来每人挖土一点七立公方，通过宣传鼓动大大提高了工效，每人平均提高到挖三点五立公方；灌溉田一千四百亩的渠道，原订五天挖成，现提前一天完成任务。孝感县还组织了民间雕刻艺人，创作了“你在抗旱吗？”“看看我们的力量！”等剪纸宣传画，推动抗旱运动。　　　　　（张灿）
