　　Running Schools to Greet the National Day
　　——New Events in Rural Areas of the German Democratic Republic
    The working people of the German Democratic Republic are carrying out various activities to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day (October 7). The farmers of Königshorst village have established a "Rural Science Academy" in the village as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    Königshorst is a small village with a population of just over four hundred. There is a machine tractor station and a "Dawn" agricultural production cooperative. The farmers are very enthusiastic about production. Not long ago, they increased the yield per hectare of sugar beets from 120 dan to 180 dan, and are now continuing to strive for further substantial increases.
    A new cultural center has been built in the village, with a film room, a Michurin research room, and a cultural room. The farmers have also converted a former garden villa of a Junker landlord into a nursing home. In addition, the village has a school and a consumer cooperative.
    However, the farmers still feel that something is missing: although the cultural center has films, lectures, and reports to enrich their cultural life, everyone still yearns to learn more about agricultural production and social life. They finally solved this problem with their own efforts: a "Rural Science Academy" was established as a gift for the National Day.
      The "Rural Science Academy" is located in the cultural center. More than eighty people enrolled at the start. The study period is six months. The "Association for the Popularization of Scientific Knowledge" is responsible for organizing the lectures. The study subjects are decided jointly by the "Rural Science Academy Committee," village cadres, representatives of the machine tractor station, the director of the cultural center, farmers, housewives, and the "Association for the Popularization of Scientific Knowledge" and the county government. There are two main principles for selecting study subjects: first, to cater to the needs of the majority of farmers as much as possible and offer courses that they urgently need; second, to offer as many specialized courses directly related to agricultural production as possible.
    Among the thirteen courses offered in the first semester, the focus is on the prospects of socialist agriculture, the materialist worldview, and the peaceful policies of the German Democratic Republic. Relevant films are appropriately used as supplementary teaching materials during lectures.
    The academy has classes once every two weeks. Participants include farmers, housewives, tractor drivers, village cadres, agronomists, and students. They all have a common wish: to cultivate themselves into new socialist farmers with high political awareness and cultural level.

### 办学院　迎国庆——德意志民主共和国农村新事

　　办学院　迎国庆
　　——德意志民主共和国农村新事
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民正在进行各种活动来迎接国庆十周年（10月7日）。柯尼希波尔恩村的农民们在村子里建立了一座“乡村科学学院”，作为对国庆十周年的献礼。
    柯尼希波尔恩是一座只有四百多人口的小村庄。这里有一座机器拖拉机站和一个“晨曦”农业生产合作社。农民们在生产方面的干劲很大。不久前他们把糖罗卜的单位面积产量从每公顷一百二十担提高到一百八十担，现在继续争取再大大提高。
    村子里新盖起来一座文化馆，里面设有电影室、米丘林研究室和文化室。农民们还把从前容克大地主的一座花园别墅改成了一个养老院。此外，村子里还有一座学校和一个消费合作社。
    不过，农民们还感到美中不足：虽然文化馆里有电影、演讲和报告来丰富他们的文化生活，可是大家还渴望着学习一些有关农业生产和社会生活方面的知识。他们终于用自己的力量解决了这个问题：一座作为国庆献礼的“乡村科学学院”建立起来了。
      “乡村科学学院”就设在文化馆里。一开学就有八十多人来报名。学习时间是半年。讲学的工作由“科学知识普及协会”负责组织。学习科目由“乡村科学学院委员会”、村干部、机器拖拉机站代表、文化馆主任、农民、家庭妇女、和“科学知识普及协会、县政府一起商量决定。选定学习科目的原则主要有两点：一，要尽可能地照顾大多数农民的要求，开办他们迫切需要的课程；二，还要尽可能多开一些直接和农业生产有关的专门课程。
    在上学期开的十三门课程中，重点是社会主义农业的远景、唯物主义世界观和德意志民主共和国的和平政策。在讲课的时候，适当地利用了有关的电影作为辅助教材。
    这个学院每两星期上一次课。参加的有农民、家庭妇女、拖拉机手、村干部、农艺师和学生。他们都有一个共同的愿望：决心把自己培养成一个具有高度政治觉悟和文化水平的社会主义新农民。
