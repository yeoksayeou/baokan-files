    Drawer-style Steamer
    The staff of the cafeteria of a certain hospital of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Harbin have created a brick-built drawer-style square steamer, which saves coal and reduces physical labor. This steamer, suitable for steaming steamed buns in large canteens, has now been promoted in 294 units in Harbin City and is very popular.
    Using this steamer to steam steamed buns made from four bags of flour requires only one cook, burning only 75 catties of coal, and it can be cooked in 40 minutes. In the past, this cafeteria used round steamers to steam the same amount of steamed buns, which required 180 catties of coal and three hours of steaming. Two cooks had to carry the steamers, often sweating profusely.
    The original drawer-style square steamers were made of wood, costing 150 to 200 yuan each, and were not durable. Now they are built with bricks on the stove, with cement or terrazzo inside. A water inlet is left on one side of the wall near the stove so that water can be added through a rubber tube after the steamed buns are placed on the steamer. The top of the steamer is covered with a circular lid woven from reed mats, with a vent hole. The front of the steamer has two wooden doors. The inside of the steamer is divided into several small wooden compartments according to needs, each with a bamboo drawer that can be freely pulled in and out. The size of the steamer is determined by the size of the stove, costing about 60 to 70 yuan, and is sturdy and durable. (Picture attached)

    抽屉式蒸笼
    解放军驻哈尔滨某部医院食堂的职工们，创造了一种既省煤又能减轻体力劳动的砖造抽屉式方形笼屉。这种适宜大食堂蒸馒头、使用的笼屉，现在已经在哈尔滨市二百九十四个单位推广，很受欢迎。
    用这种笼屉蒸四袋面粉的馒头，一个炊事员操作，只要烧七十五斤煤，四十分钟就可以蒸熟。过去这个食堂，使用圆形蒸笼蒸同样多的馒头，要用一百八十斤煤，蒸三个钟头，两个炊事员抬笼屉常常累得满头大汗。
    抽屉式方形笼屉原来用木制，每个需要一百五十到二百元，还不耐用。现在用砖砌在锅台上，里面抹水泥或彻水磨石；墙的一边靠锅台处留一进水孔，以便馒头上屉后用胶管加水。屉顶用苇席编成圆形盖，留一个出气孔；屉的正面有两扇木门，笼屉里面根据需要分成若干木制小格，每格有个能自由抽送的竹屉篓。笼屉尺寸根据锅台大小决定，成本约六、七十元，坚固耐用。（附图片）
