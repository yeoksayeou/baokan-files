The Uses of Alum

Alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate, is a clean, white, and translucent crystal, resembling a gem.

Alum is extracted from alunite. Alunite is not only used to extract alum, but the elements it contains can also be used to comprehensively manufacture various chemical products.

Alum has a wide range of uses. In the past, people only knew that alum could clarify turbid water, calling it "clarifying beads." In fact, alum has great uses in industry, agriculture, fisheries, and medical and health undertakings.

In industry, its use in papermaking makes the paper strong, clean, and beautiful, so it does not disintegrate when immersed in water, and double-sided printing does not bleed through. Its use in printing and dyeing fabrics ensures that the dyed colors last. Its use in leather making softens the leather. Its use in making candles makes the grease hard and white. Gilding, cement making, sugar refining, rubber making, paint making, explosive making, and so on also require alum. Extracting alumina from alunite is cheaper than using other raw materials.

In agriculture, alum can be used to manufacture fertilizers, promote early seedling emergence and growth in rice, and increase rice's resistance to wind, disease, and insects. It can also help accelerate the decomposition of green manure and other organic fertilizers.

In medicine, alum can be used as an astringent and antiseptic, with the functions of detoxifying and promoting fluid production, stopping bleeding and relieving pain. It can treat jaundice, blood pain, toothache, trachoma, anal prolapse, scabies, and other ailments. Fishermen add alum to various seafood catches to prevent spoilage. (Zheng Zhibiao, Li Xinmin)

    明矾的用途
    明矾也称硫酸铝钾，洁白晶莹，宛如宝石。
    明矾是由明矾石提炼的。明矾石不单只能提炼明矾，所含的元素还可以综合制造各种化学产品。
    明矾用途很广。过去人们只知道明矾能使浊水澄清，称明矾为“清水珠”。其实，明矾在工业上、农业上、渔业上以及医药卫生事业上用处都很大。
    在工业上，造纸用了它，能使纸质坚固清洁而美观，浸到水里不溃，双面印刷不会渗透。印染布匹等用了它，能使所染的颜色经久不退。制革用了它，能使皮革柔软。做蜡烛用了它，能使油脂硬而白。镀金、制水泥、制糖、制橡胶、制油漆、制炸药等等也都需要用明矾。用明矾石提炼氧化铝，比用其他原料便宜。
    在农业上，明矾能制造肥料，能促使水稻提前起苗发棵，增加水稻抗风、抗病、抗虫能力，还能帮助绿肥等有机质肥料加速分解。
    在医药上，明矾可做收敛剂和防腐剂，有解毒生津、止血定痛等作用，能治黄疸、血痛和齿痛、风眼、脱肛、疥癣等症。渔民捕到各种海产，都要加上明矾，防止腐烂。（郑志标、李新民）
