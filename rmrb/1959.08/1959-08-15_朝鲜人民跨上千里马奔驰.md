The Korean People Ride the Chollima Horse Forward
Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

Today, the Korean people greet the 14th anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation, a national holiday, by completing the industrial gross output plan of the first Five-Year Plan, an important link in the socialist construction of the country, two and a half years ahead of schedule.

In the fourteen years since liberation, the people of our country have brought about historic transformations on the land of their homeland.

Our country, which was a colonial, semi-feudal society in the past, has established a solid socialist system; our country, which inherited the backward economy of Japanese imperialism, has today become an industrial-agricultural country with a strong, independent national economic foundation.

Fourteen years is not a long time, and within this time, our country has been able to concentrate its efforts on socialist construction, and it has only been a few years since the development of the people's economy. We have spent a lot of time restoring the people's economy destroyed by Japanese imperialism, especially the war wounds suffered by the three-year war launched by US imperialism.

However, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the people of our country, closely united, have brought into play their creative enthusiasm, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and achieved achievements like today.

Due to the atrocities of the US imperialist aggressors, our people's economy was cruelly destroyed, and the people's lives were plunged into extreme poverty. However, in less than three or four years after the war, the people of our country basically healed the wounds of war and made great achievements in socialist construction. In just four or five years, our country successfully completed the most complex and arduous tasks in the socialist revolution – the socialist transformation of agriculture and the socialist transformation of urban industry and commerce.

In all sectors of the people's economy, socialist relations of production have achieved complete victory, and the root cause of poverty – the phenomenon of man exploiting man – has been eliminated forever. A socialist society without exploitation and oppression has been established in the northern half of the Republic, realizing the long-cherished wish of the Korean people.

The productive forces of the country have broken free from the shackles of the old relations of production and embarked on a broad road of unlimited development.

By 1958, our industry had reached four times the level of 1949. After the war, our industry developed at a high speed, with an average annual growth rate of more than 40%; the proportion of various industrial sectors has also undergone fundamental changes. Factories and enterprises in our heavy industry sectors, such as the metal industry, power industry, coal industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry, have been restored, renovated, and expanded on a new technical basis. In particular, our country has created a machine-building industry and built new light industry bases.

Today, our heavy industry can manufacture large-scale equipment, heavy machinery, and precision machinery for all sectors of the people's economy; light industry has grown 12.5 times during the post-war period.

The colonial economic imbalance caused by the rule of Japanese imperialism, which greatly hindered the development of the national economy and the improvement of people's lives, has been overcome. The proportion of industry in the total output value of industry and agriculture reached more than 65% last year.

Currently, all sectors of the people's economy are effectively implementing the task of technical revolution.

Great achievements have also been made in agricultural production. Grain output has increased sharply year by year. Last year, when agricultural cooperativization was completed, grain harvest was 1.4 times that of 1949. The northern half, which had always been short of food, has since been transformed into a region with surplus food. With the strong support of heavy industry, the technical transformation of agriculture - irrigation, mechanization, and electrification - is being effectively realized, and the material and technical foundations of the countryside are being rapidly consolidated.

Due to the tremendous achievements made in socialist construction, the people's material and cultural living standards have been significantly improved. In 1958, national income increased by more than 2.6 times compared to 1949.

In 1958, the actual wages of workers and staff reached more than 1.5 times that of 1949. Since January of this year, their monetary wages have increased by an average of 40%.

The real income in kind and in cash of farmers has also grown rapidly. Farmers in our country have generally reached the living standards of middle peasants or above. Many new houses, schools, and hospitals have been built in cities and villages.

The task of cultural revolution is being effectively implemented.

Last year, our country implemented a compulsory secondary education system, and preparations are currently underway to vigorously implement a compulsory technical education system mainly for junior high school graduates. Starting from the new academic year this year, another fifteen newly built universities have begun to enroll students.

Science and technology and national culture and art are also constantly developing.

Today, our country has completely healed the war wounds in people's lives. However, the people of our country are by no means satisfied with the achievements they have already made.

The people of our country have always been very poor, and coupled with the destruction of the war, they lack everything, their lives are very bad, and they are backward. If the people of our country want to live a good life, a life that is no less than others, running forward is still not fast enough, they must move forward with all their might.

Since the beginning of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, our country has launched a revolutionary upsurge known as "Chollima."

In his report at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, Comrade Kim Il-sung, based on the sincere aspirations of the people of our country, put forward the programmatic tasks to be completed in the socialist construction of our country in the next six or seven years.

If this great plan is completed, our country will, in the next six or seven years, reach the following levels in terms of the per capita output of major industrial products: electricity will reach 2,000 kWh, coal will be 2,500 kg, pig iron and granulated iron will be 400 kg, steel will be 300 to 350 kg, chemical fertilizer will be 150 to 200 kg, cement will be 500 kg, fabrics will be 50 meters, and fish catch will be 100 kg. In the next few years, the per capita grain output will reach 700 kg.

This great goal can enable us to completely eliminate the poverty and backwardness inherited from our ancestors in this era and enjoy a civilized and prosperous life. It encourages the working people of our country to continuously achieve new achievements on the labor front.

Inspired by the Party's militant call, the working people of our country are fighting heroically to reach this goal ahead of schedule.

Thanks to the selfless labor of the working people, the gross industrial output value in the first half of this year increased by 75% compared with the same period last year. At present, our industry can produce the total output of 1953 in 47 days. This year, the gross industrial output value of our country will reach seven times that of pre-war levels.

Completing socialist industrialization and implementing the technical transformation of the people's economy are the main tasks of socialist construction in our country today. To complete this task, it is necessary to rapidly develop the machine-building industry, and in particular, to rapidly increase the output of the mother machine of the machine industry – the machine tool. Under the leadership of the Party, the working people of our country chose the most correct and fastest path in our country's situation: the "machine tool producing machine tool movement" created and initiated by the masses and developed, making machine production machines and factories producing factories.

Due to the development of this movement, in the first half of this year, the production of metal-cutting machine tools increased to 5.4 times that of the same period last year; by the end of July this year, 6,900 more lathes had been produced than originally planned. Whether in machine factories or in silk weaving factories or machine repair shops of agricultural cooperatives, lathes are being manufactured wherever there are lathes. This mass movement is an important factor in accelerating the technical revolution in our country.

Responding to the Party's call to maximize the excavation of local possibilities and potential and rapidly develop the food and daily necessities industry, the working people of our country built more than 1,000 local factories throughout the country in just a few months last year. Now, there are an average of four or five factories in each city and county. This year, the products produced by these factories will reach 1.5 times the total annual output value of the Ministry of Light Industry.

The "Chollima Work Team" movement, which is widely launched in our country today, is a creative mass movement launched under the socialist system by a new type of person with the determination to "work and live as builders of socialism and communism." This movement requires: improving labor productivity; improving knowledge and technical level; and at the same time, all workers must reach the level of engineers and associate engineers; arming themselves with communist ideology, living a civilized life; establishing a communist attitude towards labor, and cultivating communist moral qualities.

In the agricultural economic sector, huge changes have taken place. In the six months from last winter to this spring, our country expanded the irrigated area of paddy fields and dry land by more than 377,000 hectares. This is equivalent to more than three times the total irrigated area before liberation. The key to the technical transformation of our agricultural economy - irrigation - has been basically completed.

Due to the construction of large-scale irrigation projects and the adoption of advanced agricultural production methods such as deep plowing, rational close planting, and scientific fertilization, an unprecedented bumper harvest scene is presented in the fields of our country this year.

Due to the establishment of irrigation systems and the adoption of advanced agricultural production methods, our country has laid the foundation for continuing to develop the agricultural economy in many ways, increasing grain production, and especially developing animal husbandry.

Today, the working people of our country are actively supporting the resolution of the June 1959 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and vigorously launching a movement to further develop animal husbandry.

Our Party's policy on developing animal husbandry is: to widely implement double-cropping rotation under the conditions of establishing irrigation systems and laying the material foundation for other high-yielding grains to establish a solid feed base. This is the correct way to develop animal husbandry in our country with limited arable land, which can ensure both the improvement of grain output and the solution of feed problems.

In order to further develop animal husbandry and further develop the agricultural economy, the Party attaches great importance to the issue of supplying more agricultural machinery to the countryside. At present, factories and enterprises in our country are working hard to produce agricultural machinery.

In order to meet the growing needs of residents for meat, milk, eggs and other livestock products in the shortest possible time, our country is actively ensuring the rapid development of animal husbandry.

Today, the great upsurge of socialist construction in our country has opened up a bright prospect for our country to enter the ideal of mankind - communist society - together with advanced fraternal countries.

All the victories and achievements that the people of our country have achieved in socialist construction are due to the wise leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and the formulation of correct policies; it is due to the working people's support for the Party's leadership and policies, bringing into play their creativity and enthusiasm, and engaging in selfless labor. During the period of post-war economic recovery and construction, our Party creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the specific realities of our country and developed a general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture.

This general line continues to exert its great vitality. If we had not developed and consolidated the foundation of the socialist economy - heavy industry - then it is very clear that our country could not have developed productive forces so rapidly as it is today, could not have promoted the technical transformation of all sectors of the people's economy, including agriculture, could not have laid a solid foundation for light industry, and could not have improved people's living standards.

Today, the reason why our country can launch an unprecedented revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction is due to the correct leadership of our Party Central Committee: according to the general line put forward by our Party's Third National Congress, we have thoroughly smashed all kinds of conspiracies by enemies at home and abroad, defended the Party's rock-solid ideological unity, brought into play the masses' endless wisdom and creativity, overcome conservative thinking and the mystical views of science and technology, and launched a historically significant
  "Chollima Movement" to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The victory achieved by the Korean people is inseparable from the proletarian internationalist assistance and cooperation of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist brother countries.

In particular, the great neighbor of our country – the Chinese people – sent their children to the Korean front line during the most difficult period of our country's Fatherland Liberation War and assisted our country with blood. In the post-war period, the Chinese People's Volunteers diligently helped the post-war recovery and construction of the Korean people until the day they returned home, building many factories, schools, and bridges, and building many irrigation projects.

In the difficult post-war period, the Chinese people provided our country with huge material and technical assistance, which greatly helped the post-war recovery and construction of the Korean people. At the same time, the victories and achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction infinitely encouraged the Korean people.

The people of North Korea and China are separated only by the Yalu River and have always been good neighbors who love and help each other in the long course of history. We are brothers cemented with blood in the struggle against common enemies and people closely united by common ideas and ideals. Therefore, no force can destroy the friendship and unity between the people of North Korea and China.

The achievements made in socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic further demonstrate the difference between the increasingly prosperous North Korea and the increasingly declining South Korea; accelerated the collapse of the colonial rule system implemented by US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea.

As we celebrate the 14th anniversary of the "August 15th" Liberation today, due to the colonial rule of US imperialism, the national economy of South Korea has been more severely damaged, and the people's lives have been plunged into dire straits.

Before the liberation of Korea, South Korea's industrial output was negligible, but today's industrial output is only half of what it was then, and South Korea's industry is completely subordinate to US monopoly capital and is at a standstill.

South Korean agriculture has suffered a serious bankruptcy, and South Korea, which has always been known as the "granary," has become a serious famine area.

The lives of the people in South Korea are extremely miserable, and even the most basic democratic rights have been trampled upon. Millions of people are unemployed or semi-unemployed, and the number of food-short households is increasing year by year, but the residents' military expenditure burden is increasing day by day.

The US imperialists, who are in trouble, collude with the Syngman Rhee clique to carry out various barbaric atrocities to maintain its colonial rule system. In the past year alone, they arrested and imprisoned 240,000 innocent people.

The US imperialists and his lackeys, the Syngman Rhee clique, who are unable to save the crisis of colonial rule, are attempting to drive desperate South Korean compatriots to foreign countries under the guise of "immigration."

The anti-US and anti-Rhee sentiment of the South Korean people, who can no longer tolerate it, is rising. The struggle of South Korean workers, peasants, and students has been further developed, and their call for the peaceful reunification of the motherland has become louder.

The governments of North Korea and China have taken proactive measures, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn from Korea. This has opened up a new situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the US military not only refuses to withdraw from South Korea, but even violates the armistice agreement, increases its armed forces in South Korea, transports atomic weapons and rocket weapons to South Korea, and engages in stupid provocative acts, deliberately intensifying the tense situation.

The US aggressor troops should withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible! This is the unanimous demand of the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world.

The US aggressor troops must withdraw from South Korea! Korea will surely achieve peaceful reunification!

The path that the Korean people have traveled in the fourteen years since liberation proves the great vitality of the invincible, scientific Marxism-Leninism and demonstrates the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

As a member of the socialist camp, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, hold sovereignty in their own hands and bravely move towards a glorious future! No force can stop the Korean people from moving forward.

For the socialist construction of the country and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the Korean people will fight more bravely and stand firm on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

    朝鲜人民跨上千里马奔驰
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁第一副首相　金一
    今天，朝鲜人民以提前两年半完成在国家社会主义建设中的重要环节——第一个五年计划的工业总产值计划，来迎接民族节日——“八·一五”解放十四周年。
    解放后十四年来，我国人民在祖国的土地上造成了历史性的转变。
    在过去是殖民地、半封建社会的我国，已经建立起巩固的社会主义制度；在继承了日本帝国主义落后经济的我国，今天已经变成了具有强大的自主的民族经济基础的工业—农业国家。
    十四年的时间不能算长，而且在这个时间内，我国能够集中全力来进行社会主义建设，发展人民经济才不过几年。恢复被日本帝国主义破坏的人民经济，特别是恢复由美帝国主义发起的三年战争所受到的战争创伤，使我们花费了不少的时间。
    但是，我国人民在劳动党的领导下，紧紧团结在一起，发挥了创造性的热情，克服了种种困难，取得了像今天这样的成就。
    由于美帝国主义侵略者的暴行，我国人民经济遭到了残酷的破坏，人民生活陷于极端贫穷的境地。但我国人民在战后不到三、四年的时间内，基本上医治了战争创伤，并且在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。仅在四、五年时间内，我国顺利地完成了在社会主义革命中最复杂最艰巨的任务——农业的社会主义改造和城市工商业者的社会主义改造。
    在人民经济各部门，社会主义生产关系已经取得了完全的胜利，永远消除了贫穷的根源——人剥削人的现象。在共和国北半部建立了没有剥削和压迫的社会主义社会，实现了朝鲜人民的宿愿。
    国家的生产力挣脱旧生产关系的束缚，走上了可以无限发展的广阔道路。
    我国的工业，到1958年，达到了1949年水平的四倍。战后，我国的工业在高速度发展，每年平均增长率为40％以上；工业各部门的比重也发生了根本的变化。我国的金属工业、电力工业、煤炭工业、化学工业和建筑材料工业等重工业部门的工厂企业，已在新的技术基础上得到恢复、改建和扩建。特别是我国创建了机器制造工业，并新建了轻工业基地。
    今天，我国的重工业已能为人民经济各部门制造大型设备、重型机器以及精密机器；轻工业在战后期间增长到十二点五倍。
    日本帝国主义的统治所造成的大大阻挠国家经济发展和人民生活改善的殖民地经济发展不平衡性已被克服。工业在工农业总产值中所占的比重，去年已达65％以上。
    目前，人民经济各部门正在有效地执行技术革命的任务。
    在农业生产中也取得了巨大的成就。谷物产量逐年急剧增长。在完成了农业合作化的去年，谷物收获量为1949年的一点四倍。一向粮食不足的北半部，从此转变成为粮食有余的地区。在重工业的强有力的支援下，正在有效地实现农业的技术改造——水利化、机械化和电气化，迅速地巩固农村的物质、技术基础。
    由于在社会主义建设中取得了这样巨大的成就，人民的物质文化生活水平有了显著的提高。1958年国民收入增长到1949年的二点六倍以上。
    1958年，职工实际工资达到1949年的一点五倍以上。从今年1月起，他们的货币工资又平均提高了40％。
    农民的实物和货币收入也增长得很快。我国农民已经普遍达到中农或中农以上的生活水平。在各城市和乡村，新建了许多住宅、学校和医院。
    文化革命的任务正在有效地执行。
    去年，我国已经实行了中等义务教育制，目前正在大力进行以初中毕业生为主要对象的技术义务教育制的准备工作。从今年新学年度起，又有十五所新建的大学开始招收学生。
    科学技术和民族文化艺术也在不断地发展。
    今天，我国已完全医治了人民生活中的战争创伤。但是，我国人民决不满足于已经取得的成就。
    我国人民的生活一向很贫困，加上遭受了战争的破坏，什么都缺乏，生活很不好，而且落后。我国人民要过好生活，过不亚于人家的生活，向前奔跑还嫌不快，要快马加鞭地前进。
    从开始执行第一个五年计划的时候起，我国就掀起了被称为“千里马”的革命高潮。
    金日成同志在庆祝共和国成立十周年大会上的报告中，根据我国人民的切实愿望，提出了今后六、七年内在我国社会主义建设中将要完成的纲领性任务。
    如果这个伟大的计划得到完成，我国在今后的六、七年内，在主要工业产品按人口平均计算的产量方面，电力将达到二千度，煤炭为二千五百公斤，生铁和粒铁为四百公斤，钢为三百至三百五十公斤，化学肥料为一百五十至二百公斤，水泥为五百公斤，织品为五十公尺，捕鱼量为一百公斤。在最近几年内，按人口平均计算的谷物产量将达到七百公斤。
    这个伟大的目标，可以使我们这一时代完全消除从祖先那里继承下来的贫穷和落后，享受文明而富裕的生活，它鼓舞我国劳动人民在劳动战线上不断取得新的成就。
    在党的战斗性号召的鼓舞下，我国劳动人民为提前达到这一目标而英勇奋斗。
    由于劳动人民进行了忘我劳动，今年上半年的工业总产值，比去年同期增长了75％。目前我国工业，在四十七天内就能生产1953年一年的总产量。今年我国的工业总产值将达到战前的七倍。
    完成社会主义工业化，实行人民经济的技术改革，是当前我国社会主义建设中的主要任务。为了完成这一任务，就必须迅速地发展机械制造业，特别需要迅速地增加机械工业的母体——工作母机的产量。在党的领导下，我国劳动人民选择了在我国情况下最正确而最快的道路：由群众创造和发起而得到展开的“机床生产机床运动”，使机械生产机械，工厂生产工厂。
    由于这一运动的展开，在今年上半年，金属切削机床的生产，增加到去年同期的五点四倍；到今年7月底为止，比原订计划增产了六千九百台车床。不论在机器厂，或是在绢织厂、农业合作社的机器修配厂，凡是有车床的地方，都在制造车床。这一群众性的运动，是加速实现我国技术革命的重要因素。
    我国劳动人民响应党关于最大限度地挖掘地方的可能性和潜力，迅速发展食品及日用品工业的号召，仅在去年几个月的时间内，就在全国各地建立起一千多个地方工厂。现在，全国每个市郡平均有四、五个工厂。今年这些工厂所生产的产品，将达到轻工业省全年总产值的一点五倍。
    今天在我国广泛展开的“千里马作业班”运动，是在社会主义制度下，新型的人在“以社会主义、共产主义建设者的姿态工作、生活”的决心下展开的创造性的群众运动。这一运动要求：提高劳动生产率；提高知识和技术水平；同时要使全体工人达到工程师和副工程师的水平；用共产主义思想武装自己，过文明的生活；建立对劳动的共产主义态度，培养共产主义道德品质。
    在农业经济部门，发生了巨大的变化。在去年冬季到今年春季的六个月内，我国扩大了三十七万七千多町步的水田和旱田灌溉面积。这等于解放前灌溉总面积的三倍以上。我国农业经济技术改革的关键——水利化，基本完成了。
    由于兴修了大规模的灌溉工程，同时采用了深耕、合理密植、科学施肥等先进的农业生产方法，今年在我国田野上呈现出空前丰收景象。
    由于建立了灌溉系统，采用了先进农业生产方法，我国已经打下了继续能够多方面发展农业经济、增产谷物、特别是发展畜产业的基础。
    今天，我国劳动人民积极拥护朝鲜劳动党中央委员会1959年6月全体会议的决议，大力展开进一步发展畜产业的运动。
    我们党关于发展畜产业的方针是：在建立了灌溉系统、并且奠定了其他谷物丰产的物质基础的条件下，广泛地实施双季轮作，以建立巩固的饲料基地。这是在我国耕地面积有限的情况下，既能保证提高谷物产量，又能解决饲料问题的发展畜产业的正确途径。
    为了进一步发展畜产业、进一步发展农业经济，党十分重视向农村供应更多的农业机器这一问题。目前，我国各工厂企业都在为生产农业机器而努力。
    为了在最短时间内满足居民对肉类、牛奶鸡蛋等畜产品的日益增长的需要，我国正在积极保证畜产业的迅速发展。
    今天在我国所掀起的社会主义建设的大高潮，给我国开辟了能够同先进的兄弟国家一起进入人类理想——共产主义社会的光辉前景。
    在社会主义建设中，我国人民所取得的一切胜利和成就，是由于朝鲜劳动党进行了英明领导，制订了正确的政策；是由于劳动人民拥护党的领导和政策，发挥创造性和积极性，进行了忘我的劳动。在战后人民经济恢复建设时期，我们党把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于我国的具体现实，制订了优先发展重工业、同时发展轻工业和农业的总路线。
    这个总路线不断地发挥它巨大的生命力。如果我们没有发展和巩固社会主义经济的基础——重工业，那么十分明显，我国就不能像今天这样迅速地发展生产力，不能促进包括农业在内的人民经济各部门的技术改造，不能奠定强大的轻工业基础，也不能提高人民的生活水平。
    今天，我国所以能够在社会主义建设中掀起空前的革命高潮，是由于我们党中央委员会进行了正确的领导：根据我们党第三次代表大会所提出的总路线，彻底粉碎国内外敌人的各种阴谋，保卫了党的思想上的坚如磐石般的统一，发挥了群众的无穷无尽的智慧和创造性，克服保守思想和对科学技术的神秘观点，为提前完成第一个五年计划而展开了有历史意义的
  “千里马运动”。
    朝鲜人民所取得的胜利，是同苏联、中国等社会主义兄弟国家的无产阶级国际主义援助和合作分不开的。
    特别是我国的伟大的邻邦——中国人民，在我国最艰苦的祖国解放战争时期，派遣了自己的儿女到朝鲜前线，以鲜血援助了我国。在战后时期，中国人民志愿军，直到回国的那一天为止，辛勤地帮助朝鲜人民的战后恢复建设，建筑了许多工厂、学校和桥梁，兴修了许多灌溉工程。
    在艰苦的战后时期，中国人民给予我国巨大的物质和技术上的援助，对朝鲜人民的战后恢复建设给予巨大的帮助。同时，中国人民在社会主义建设大跃进中所取得的胜利和成就，无限地鼓舞了朝鲜人民。
    朝中两国人民只相隔一条鸭绿江，在悠久的历史岁月中一向是热爱互助的好邻居。我们是在反对共同敌人的斗争中以鲜血凝结成的兄弟，也是以共同的思想和理想紧密团结在一起的人民。因此，任何力量都不能破坏朝中两国人民的友谊和团结。
    共和国北半部社会主义建设中所取得的成就，更显示出日趋繁荣的朝鲜北部和日趋没落的南朝鲜之间的差异；加速了美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮在南朝鲜实施的殖民统治体系的崩溃。
    当我们庆祝“八·一五”解放十四周年的今天，由于美帝国主义的殖民统治，南朝鲜的民族经济遭到更严重的破坏，人民的生活陷于水深火热之中。
    在朝鲜解放前，南朝鲜的工业产量可说是微不足道，但今天的工业产量只等于那时的一半，南朝鲜的工业完全隶属于美国垄断资本，陷于停顿状态。
    南朝鲜农业遭到严重的破产，一向以“谷仓”著称的南朝鲜，已变为严重的饥馑地区。
    南朝鲜的人民的生活凄惨之极，连最起码的民主权利也遭到蹂躏。失业者和半失业者达数百万名，断粮农户逐年增多，但居民的军费负担却与日俱增。
    陷于困境的美帝国主义者勾结李承晚匪帮，肆行各种野蛮的暴行来维持它的殖民统治制度。仅在去年一年之中，他们就逮捕并囚禁了二十四万无辜人民。
    无法拯救殖民统治危机的美帝国主义者和他的走狗李承晚匪帮，在“移民”的幌子下，企图把走投无路的南朝鲜同胞驱逐到外国去。
    忍无可忍的南朝鲜人民的反美抗李情绪日益高涨。南朝鲜工人、农民、学生的斗争进一步展开了，他们要求祖国和平统一的呼声更加响亮了。
    朝中两国政府采取了主动措施，中国人民志愿军撤出了朝鲜。这为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了新的局面。但是，美军不仅不撤出南朝鲜，甚至违反停战协定，在南朝鲜增加武装力量，往南朝鲜运进原子武器及火箭武器，并进行愚蠢的挑衅行为，蓄意加剧紧张局势。
    美国侵略军应当早日撤出南朝鲜！这是朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致要求。
    美国侵略军一定得撤出南朝鲜！朝鲜必将实现和平统一！
    解放后十四年来，朝鲜人民所走过的道路，证明了战无不胜的、科学的马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力，显示了社会主义制度的无可比拟的优越性。
    朝鲜人民作为社会主义阵营的一员，在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，把主权掌握在自己手中，朝着光荣的未来勇敢前进！任何力量都不能阻挡朝鲜人民的前进。
    为了国家的社会主义建设和祖国的和平统一，朝鲜人民将更加勇敢地斗争，坚守在社会主义阵营的东方前哨。
