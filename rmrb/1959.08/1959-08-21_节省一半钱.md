    Saving Half the Money

    The commercial departments in Changchun have the following regulation: When customers buy gold pen nibs, if the buyer brings an old "Heilongjiang" brand nib, they only need to spend 1.5 yuan to buy a new "Heilongjiang" brand nib worth 3 yuan. This method is very good because it saves materials and reduces the economic burden on customers, which is a win-win situation.

    According to the sales staff, not all gold pen factories across the country have implemented this method, but this method is worth promoting extensively.

    节省一半钱
    长春商业部门有这样的规定：顾客买金笔尖时，若买主带上旧“黑龙江”牌笔尖，只要花一元五角钱就可以买到一个价值三元钱的“黑龙江”牌新笔尖。这种办法很好，既可以节约材料，也减轻了顾客的经济负担，真是两全其美。
    据售货员同志说，全国的金笔厂还没有全部实行这种办法，但这种办法值得大大推广。              吉林省  王琦
