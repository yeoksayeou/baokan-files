Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th: Hanoi newspapers today published a letter to the Lao people from the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued on August 2nd. The letter put forward the party's nine-point action program.

The letter to the whole nation stated that the Sananikone clique and the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are discriminating against and retaliating against the Lao Patriotic Front, plotting to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. They have also arrested and imprisoned Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, while at the same time launching a civil war, slaughtering the people, and attempting to turn Laos into an American war base. The letter pointed out that the Sananikone government is also colluding with the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem reactionary clique, the Chiang Kai-shek gang from Taiwan, and Southeast Asian aggressive blocs, and is allowing the United States to fully control the Lao government's army.

The letter pointed out that the above actions seriously violated the Geneva Accords, betrayed the agreements signed by both sides of Laos, infringed upon the power of the National Assembly, damaged the national system, trampled on the people's basic freedoms, undermined the country's peaceful neutrality, independence, unity and national harmony, and trampled on the earnest wishes of people from all walks of life and the highest interests of the motherland. The above actions also threaten the peace of Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world. The letter stated that the Lao people are determined not to be slaves of American imperialism and the Sananikone clique. The letter said: In order to oppose their plot to eliminate the Second Battalion of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, the Second Battalion of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units carried out heroic self-defense battles, causing them to suffer a disastrous defeat. The people of Xieng Khouang also fought side by side with the Second Battalion to jointly oppose the persecution and "sweeps" of the Sananikone clique. This struggle movement is currently unfolding widely throughout the country, and people from Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces all the way to Vientiane, Khammouane, Savannakhet, Salavan, and Attapeu have risen up to wage brave and fierce struggles against the kingdom government's mad "sweeps."

The letter called: "Faced with the serious crisis threatening our motherland, all patriotic and peace-loving Lao people need to unite and fight against the interference of American imperialism and the treacherous conspiracy of the Phoui Sananikone clique, and to struggle for the just implementation of the Geneva Accords and the agreements signed in Vientiane between the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, now more than ever."

The letter demanded:
    (1) Immediately stop the civil war.
    (2) Immediately restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.
    (3) Immediately stop the persecution, discrimination, and retaliation against cadres of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel, immediately stop the "sweeps," persecution, and arrests of the people, immediately restore the freedom of former resistance personnel and cadres who are being imprisoned, guarantee the people's democratic freedoms, respect the freedom of activity of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Peace and Neutrality Committee, and all progressive parties, and respect the power of the National Assembly and the Constitution.
    (4) Establish a coalition government with representatives from the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, various progressive parties, and various ethnic groups.
    (5) The administrative regulations of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces stipulated in the agreements signed by both sides must be respected, the lackeys of pro-American elements who are currently serving in the two provinces and persecuting the people must be withdrawn, and cadres of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units who have already joined the establishment in accordance with the agreements must be reappointed to their positions.
    (6) Implement a policy of peaceful neutrality and opposition to American interference, and immediately stop the import of American weapons and officers into Laos. In accordance with the Bandung spirit, establish friendly relations with all countries with different social and political systems on the basis of equality and mutual respect for sovereignty and independence.
    (7) Improve the lives of people of all classes and ethnic groups, abolish unreasonable taxes, and oppose LaFu and Latin.
    (8) Oppose the economic manipulation by American imperialism, abolish the monopoly of pro-American elements in commerce, establish a prosperous national economy, and accept economic assistance from any country willing to help Laos unconditionally.
    (9) Oppose American yellow culture, develop a genuine national culture, respect Buddhism, and maintain the people's good customs and habits.

The letter stated that these are the action program of the Lao Patriotic Front and the most earnest wishes of the people of all classes and ethnic groups throughout the country.

The letter called on the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the participating countries, the member states of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, and especially India, as the chairman of the Lao International Commission, to immediately take the most effective measures to stop the conspiracy of American imperialism and the Sananikone clique to expand the civil war, first and foremost by immediately restoring the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

The letter also called on the Asian and African countries with the Bandung spirit and the peace-loving people of the world to support the just struggle of the Lao people.

At a meeting held at the end of July, the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front also decided to resume publication of the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper," the central organ of the Patriotic Front, which was closed down by the Sananikone government in May of this year. The letter to the whole nation was published in the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" on August 2nd.
