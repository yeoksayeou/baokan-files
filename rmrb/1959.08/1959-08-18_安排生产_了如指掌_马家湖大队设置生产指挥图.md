　　Arranging Production with Full Knowledge
　　Majiahu Brigade Sets Up Production Command Map

　　This newspaper's Yinchuan dispatch of the 17th: The Majiahu Brigade of Shuangzha Commune in Jinji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has creatively established a production command map in field management, which has played a significant role in the rational use of cultivated land and the planned arrangement of production.

　　The production command map is a map of all the land in the production team, with different colors and patterns marking the grade and soil quality of each piece of land, what crop was planted last year, and what crop is planted this year. The map also includes text indicating the land number, acreage, per-mu yield target, and the name of the person responsible for management. With a clear and concise cultivation map, team cadres can effectively arrange production and allocate labor and livestock accordingly.

　　The establishment of the production command map in the Majiahu Brigade was gradually explored based on production needs. This brigade has more than 9,800 mu of land, including more than a dozen different types of soil, such as loess, sandy soil, yellow clay soil, red cotton soil, and white alkaline soil. In the past, due to the imperfect land management system, the leadership did not have a clear understanding of the situation, grasping one aspect while neglecting another, and focusing on the east while forgetting the west. Some land was not rotated; some land was not planted with suitable crops; and some land was not improved as necessary, failing to fully exploit the potential of the land. Especially after communization, the scope of the team expanded, the amount of cultivated land increased, and the implementation of the basic farmland system further complicated the situation, as the land was divided into three or four grades. It was necessary to conduct detailed research on the soil quality of each piece of land, what crop it had previously held, what crop to plant, and how to adopt localized processing measures after planting. In the past, cadres relied solely on memory to arrange production, which often failed to make the best use of the land and implement intensive farming.

　　How to solve these difficult problems? The brigade's general party branch conducted research and believed that the eighth production team's method of using maps to guide production in 1956 was very good. Therefore, it organized manpower to measure all the land in the brigade, investigated the soil properties, and re-examined and mapped the land in conjunction with the land planning. Then, based on the topography, soil quality, water source, and past deep plowing, fertilization, soil improvement, and yield of each piece of land, the brigade determined the grade and different processing measures, and marked them on the map. In this way, the entire production command map was drawn up.

　　The use of the production command map immediately promoted production. First, the leadership had a clear understanding of the situation, and production could be directed flexibly, making it easier to inspect work. For the commune members, it was very convenient to cultivate the land by looking at the map. This year, each production team generally planted suitable crops according to the soil quality and previous crop of each piece of land, ensuring that the crop rotation was appropriate and that the soil and seeds were suitable. The bumper harvest of wheat in this brigade this year is closely related to the rational use of cultivated land. At present, the Majiahu Brigade is combining the experience of summarizing wheat production with research on the advantages and disadvantages of the production command map, and plans to further improve it to make the production command map play a greater role.

### 安排生产　了如指掌　马家湖大队设置生产指挥图

　　安排生产　了如指掌
　　马家湖大队设置生产指挥图
    本报银川17日电　宁夏回族自治区金积县双闸公社马家湖大队在田间管理中，创造性地建立了生产指挥图，对合理使用耕地，有计划地安排生产，起了很大作用。
    生产指挥图，就是以生产队为单位，把全队的土地画成一张地图，用不同颜色的各种图案，标明每块土地的等级、土质，去年是什么槎子，今年种的什么庄稼，用文字注明地号、亩数、亩产指标、管理人姓名等。有了一张一目了然的耕作图，队干部就可以据此来有效地安排生产，调配劳畜力。
    马家湖大队建立生产指挥图，是根据生产需要逐步摸索出来的。这个大队共有九千八百多亩地，其中有黄土、砂土、黄胶土、红棉土、白碱土等十几种性质不同的土壤。以往由于土地管理制度不健全，领导上心里没有底，抓一片，丢一点，顾了东，忘了西；有的地没有调槎；有的地没有种上适宜的庄稼；有的地没有进行必要的改良，不能充分发挥土地的潜力。特别是公社化以后，队的范围扩大，耕地增多，加上实行了基本农田制，土地划分为三四级，情况就更复杂。每块田是什么土质，是啥槎子，种什么作物，种上以后又怎样因地制宜采取加工措施，都要进行细致的研究。过去干部单凭记忆安排生产，往往不能地尽其用，精耕细作。
    怎样解决这些困难问题呢？大队党总支进行了研究，认为第八生产队在1956年用过的看图指挥生产的办法很好，便组织力量，丈量了全大队土地，查清了土壤性能，再结合规划土地进行复查、画图，然后根据每块地的地势、土质、水源，和历年深翻、施肥、土壤改良和产量等情况，确定等级和不同的加工措施，在图上注明。这样，整个生产指挥图就绘制出来了。
    运用生产指挥图以后，马上就起了推动生产的作用。首先是领导心中有数，指挥生产灵活，便于检查工作。对社员来说，可以看图耕作，十分方便。今年各生产队一般都做到了根据每块土地的土质和前槎，种上了适宜的作物，做到了槎口顺，土、种适宜。这个大队的小麦在今年取得大丰收和合理使用耕地有密切的关系。目前马家湖大队正在结合总结小麦丰产经验，研究生产指挥图的优点和不足之处，打算再进一步改进，使生产指挥图发挥更大作用。
