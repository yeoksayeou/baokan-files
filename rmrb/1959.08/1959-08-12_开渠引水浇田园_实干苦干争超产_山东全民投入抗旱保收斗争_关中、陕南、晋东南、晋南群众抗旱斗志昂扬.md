Digging Canals to Divert Water to Irrigate Fields: Working Hard and Practically to Strive for Overproduction
Shandong's Entire Population Engaged in the Struggle to Combat Drought and Ensure Harvest
People in Guanzhong, Southern Shaanxi, Southeastern Shanxi, and Southern Shanxi Display High Morale in Fighting Drought

Shandong
    Jinan, August 11 (This newspaper) – A high tide has formed in Shandong Province's movement to combat drought and ensure harvest. As of the 6th, the province had mobilized over six million laborers daily for the drought resistance movement, irrigating more than 1.1 million mu of land each day. Over 10 million mu of crops have been irrigated and are growing well.
    Currently, the drought situation in Shandong Province continues to develop. Sixty-three counties across the province are affected by drought, with a total affected area of over 54 million mu. To overcome the drought and save the seedlings, the Provincial Party Committee requires the entire Party and all the people to urgently mobilize and fully engage in the drought resistance and harvest protection movement. In all areas with irrigation conditions, efforts should be made to irrigate autumn seedlings once. Aim to irrigate 50 million mu of land within half a month and strive to achieve overproduction plans. Areas with poor irrigation conditions should strive to minimize production reduction or avoid it altogether, and compensate for reduced production by rushing to plant late autumn grains and autumn vegetables, ensuring that the province achieves or exceeds its grain and cotton production targets.
    In the fight against drought, all regions, from counties to communes and production teams, have ensured that secretaries take the lead, cadres are assigned to specific areas, and they lead by example in working hard. Under the leadership of cadres, the broad masses have worked hard and strived to fight drought day and night. Their slogans are: "Don't wait for rain, don't rely on heaven, conquer drought and ensure overproduction," and "Don't stop fighting drought until the rain soaks through." The Middle Team and West Team of the Qianliqiao Production Team in the Chengguan Commune of Juancheng County launched a red flag competition in drought resistance. The Middle Team won the red flag for irrigating more land. The members of the West Team immediately studied ways to improve water lifting methods, doubling their efficiency and seizing the red flag from the Middle Team in the second evaluation. However, the Middle Team was not willing to give up. They adopted a combination of canal diversion and manual splashing methods, tripling their work efficiency and reclaiming the red flag in the third evaluation. In Yidu County, 80% of the labor force of the Pujiajian Brigade in the Ordinary Commune was put into drought resistance. The members went up the hill early to fight the drought, ate at the fields, and automatically worked overtime to divert water. Jia Guixiang, a new bride in this team, also volunteered to work with her groom. In Feicheng County, 180,000 laborers participated in drought resistance every day, irrigating 345,000 mu of land. The Xiangjia Liulin Production Team of the Gaochun Commune had 4,400 mu of hilly land that had never been irrigated before. Some members said that it was impossible to irrigate because the mountains were high and the water was low. However, after fully mobilizing the masses, it was decided to first divert the water from mountain ditches and wells to the foot of the mountain, and then carry the water up the mountain. Now these alpine crops are universally irrigated. The members said: The old calendar is no longer valid. Shouzhang County adopted measures of planning, marking, digging channels, and irrigating land simultaneously, digging more than 2,200 new channels. For land far from ditches, pumps and waterwheels were used, adopting methods such as "three turns around the bay" and "five crossings over the ridge" to send water to the farmland.
    During the drought resistance effort, all regions paid attention to the health of the members and rationally arranged their lives. In many places, in addition to setting up mobile shacks in the fields and at the wells for the members to rest and sleep in shifts, each county and commune universally organized health and medical teams of dozens or even hundreds of people, who went deep into the fields for roving treatment. They were both medical teams and drought resistance teams. Some communes also organized and reorganized canteens and nurseries.
    Commercial departments in various regions have also tried their best to support the drought resistance and harvest protection movement. In addition to allocating the materials already arranged for the third quarter to various regions, the Provincial Department of Commerce has also allocated additional fuel needed for pumps and parts for various drought resistance tools. Industrial departments have tried their best to extract manpower and go deep into the fields to help repair tools. (Wang Jingwen)

Guanzhong, Southern Shaanxi
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch – The Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi regions of Shaanxi Province, which are threatened by severe drought, have launched a drought resistance struggle involving the entire population. At present, 1.91 million drought resistance troops are intensively irrigating autumn fields. By August 2nd, they had irrigated 6.43 million mu of land, some of which had been irrigated two or three times. The irrigated autumn fields have turned from yellow to green and are growing normally.
    The Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi regions have not had a thorough rain since the summer harvest in June. The rainfall in July was only equivalent to 10%-50% of the rainfall in the same period last year. Although there was a moderate rain in the eastern Guanzhong area recently, and the drought has eased slightly, the drought situation in other areas continues to develop. Many small rivers have dried up, weirs and ponds are short of water, and the amount of water in irrigation canals has decreased. The drought-affected autumn grain crops have reached about 16 million mu (accounting for about 47% of the province's autumn grain crop area); the drought-affected cotton fields are 4.35 million mu (accounting for 94% of the province's cotton field area). The tassels of some early corn have been dried by the sun; the late corn has turned yellow and curled its leaves, and some millet seedlings have been burned; the cotton bolls have fallen off due to drought and insect pests.
    The serious drought has not frightened the broad cadres and people of Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi. Cadres and members in various regions are looking for water, digging wells, tapping springs, blocking rivers, building dams, scooping water, carrying water, and using waterwheels to fight the drought. As early as June, when the drought first emerged, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee instructed the drought-affected areas to quickly launch a drought resistance struggle. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee made a comprehensive analysis of the drought situation in the province and further deployed drought resistance work. The Provincial Party Committee also convened a drought resistance and autumn protection coordination meeting of industrial, commercial, transportation and other relevant departments to organize forces from all aspects to support drought resistance and solve problems such as the matching of irrigation machinery and equipment and the supply of materials.

Southeastern Shanxi, Southern Shanxi
    Taiyuan, August 11 (This newspaper) – A high tide of drought resistance has been set off in the mountainous areas of southeastern Shanxi and the plains of southern Shanxi, which have been dry for a long time.
    At present, there are more than 2.4 million troops engaged in drought resistance in these two regions, and more than 2.6 million mu of drought-stricken autumn crops have been irrigated. Most areas of southeastern Shanxi have organized a professional irrigation and seedling protection water conservancy army, giving full play to the benefits of existing water conservancy projects and carrying out a rational irrigation movement. The power machinery occupied by commune industry and sideline businesses has also been put into the drought resistance struggle. Various places have also adopted methods such as "moving" waterwheels, merging flows for long-distance irrigation, and raising well platforms to give full play to the role of water conservancy equipment. Licheng, Qin County, Jincheng and other counties are combining seedling irrigation with topdressing. The self-flowing irrigation area in southern Shanxi region has more than 5,800 clear water channels and more than 150 reservoirs, all of which are opened for water release. Since late July, an average of 140,000 mu of land has been irrigated every day, an increase of 1.8 times compared with the progress of 50,000 mu per day before the drought resistance. In order to solve the problem of insufficient irrigation livestock power, Yuncheng, Wenxi, Houma, and Ruicheng counties also organized more than 20,000 people to push waterwheels. In the water-deficient areas of Gaoyuan County, vehicles and horses were all mobilized, and water was transported by car, animal transport, and human carrying to irrigate the seedlings.
    During the drought resistance period, various regions supported each other. Dengjiazhuang and Shicun communes in Linfen County cooperated, breaking the water use boundaries, so that 500 mu of severely drought-stricken autumn fields were quickly irrigated.
    Recently, the Southeast Shanxi and South Shanxi prefectural party committees have comprehensively deployed drought resistance work, requiring all localities to overcome right-leaning emotions, further mobilize the masses to strengthen their confidence that man will conquer nature, and at the same time put forward new tasks for drought resistance and harvest protection. The Southeast Shanxi Prefectural Party Committee requires the entire region to continue to carry out drought resistance movements. In areas where it has rained, late autumn crops and autumn vegetables should be quickly planted on the 200,000 mu of autumn fields where the seedlings have withered; in areas where it has not rained, a movement to protect one mu of seedlings per person should be launched; areas with good water conservancy conditions should strengthen field management and carry out an overproduction movement. After classification and ranking, the South Shanxi Prefectural Party Committee requires drought-stricken areas to take drought resistance as the overriding center of everything and launch a blitz of irrigating the fields day and night, ensuring that every drop of water is contested, every seedling is protected, water-irrigated land guarantees a bumper harvest, and dry land does not reduce production. In areas where it has rained, a mass movement of "take it back, make it up, and strive for a bumper harvest" should be launched, and efforts should be made to compensate for dry land losses with water-irrigated land, reduce the harvest of major autumn crops with late autumn crops, compensate for grain losses with vegetables, and compensate for agricultural losses with sideline businesses.
    The Southeast Shanxi region is the main miscellaneous grain producing area in Shanxi Province, and the South Shanxi Plain is the cotton and wheat producing area. These two regions have generally experienced drought and lack of rain since the beginning of July. According to incomplete statistics, the disaster area of 8 million mu of major autumn crops in southeastern Shanxi reached 3.44 million mu, and the seedlings in severely affected areas have begun to wither. The drought-stricken cotton and autumn fields in 17 counties and cities in southern Shanxi region reached more than 4 million mu, accounting for more than 40% of the total area. To support the drought resistance struggle in these two regions, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee has drawn up a large number of responsible cadres to form drought resistance inspection groups, led by Wang Qian, secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, to go to the counties severely affected by the drought in southern Shanxi and southeastern Shanxi to help promote drought resistance work. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce has also made emergency arrangements to actively strengthen the supply of drought resistance materials.

　　开渠引水浇田园　实干苦干争超产
　　山东全民投入抗旱保收斗争
　　关中、陕南、晋东南、晋南群众抗旱斗志昂扬
　　山东
    本报济南11日电　山东省抗旱保收运动已经形成高潮。截至6日止，全省每天投入抗旱运动的劳力有六百多万人，每天可浇地一百一十多万亩。已浇的农作物一千多万亩，生长良好。
    目前，山东省旱情继续发展，全省已有六十三个县受旱，受旱面积达五千四百多万亩。为了战胜干旱，抢救禾苗，省委要求全党全民紧急动员，全力以赴投入抗旱保收运动。在一切有水利条件的地区，秋苗要争取普浇一遍，在半个月内，抗旱浇地五千万亩，力争实现超产计划；水利条件较差的地区要力争不减产或少减产，并从抢种晚秋粮、秋菜中弥补减产损失，保证全省实现或超额实现粮棉生产指标。
    在抗旱斗争中，各地区从县到公社、生产队，都作到了书记挂帅，干部分片包干，带头苦干。广大群众在干部带头下，都发奋图强，日夜轮番向干旱战斗。人们的口号是：“不等雨，不靠天，战胜干旱保超产”，“雨下不透，抗旱不停”。鄄城县城关公社前李桥生产队的中小队和西小队在抗旱中展开了红旗竞赛，中小队浇地多得了流动红旗，西小队的社员们马上研究提水办法，使效率提高一倍，在第二次评比中，把中小队手中的红旗夺了去。可是中小队并不甘心，他们采用了开渠引水和人工泼浇相结合的办法，使工效提高了三倍，在第三次评比中又夺回了红旗。益都县普通公夹涧大队80％的劳力投入了抗旱。社员们提早上坡抗旱，吃饭在田头，自动地加班引水。这个队的新媳妇贾桂香，也争着和新郎一起出工。肥城县每天参加抗旱的劳力达十八万人，已浇地三十四万五千亩。高春公社祥家柳林生产队，有四千四百亩山岭地，过去从未浇过水，一些社员反映山高水低没法浇，但经过充分发动群众，决定先把山沟、水井的水引到山脚下，再挑水上山去。现在这些高山作物普浇一遍。社员们说：老皇历使不得了。寿张县采取了边规划、边插标、边挖渠、边浇地的措施，新挖渠道二千二百多条，对离沟渠远的土地，用抽水机抽，水车提，采取三倒湾、五越岭的办法，将水送到庄稼地里。
    在抗旱中，各地注意了社员的身体健康和合理地安排生活。许多地方除在田间、井边搭起流动窝棚供社员轮流休息和睡觉外，各县、各公社普遍组织了几十人以至几百人的卫生医疗队伍，深入田间巡回治疗，他们既是医疗队，也是抗旱队。有些公社还组织和整顿了食堂、托儿所。
    各地商业部门也都千方百计地支援抗旱保收运动。省商业厅除将第三季度已安排的物资拨给各地外，又增拨抽水机所需燃料和各种抗旱工具的零件。工业部门都尽量抽出人力深入田间，帮助修配工具。（王京文）
　　关中、陕南
    据新华社讯　受到严重干旱威胁的陕西省关中和陕南地区，掀起了全民性的抗旱斗争。现在，一百九十一万抗旱大军正在紧张地灌溉秋田，到八月二日，已经浇地六百四十三万亩，有的还浇过两遍和三遍。经过灌溉的秋田，都由黄变绿，生长正常。
    关中、陕南地区从6月夏收以后，就没有下过透雨。7月降雨量仅相当于去年同期降雨量的10％—50％。最近关中东部地区虽然下过一场中雨，旱象稍有缓和，但其他地区的旱象仍在继续发展，许多小河断流，堰塘缺水，灌渠水量减少，受旱的秋粮作物已达一千六百万亩左右（约占全省秋粮作物面积47％）；受旱棉田有四百三十五万亩（占全省棉田面积94％）。有些早玉米的天花已经晒干；晚玉米变黄卷叶，有的谷子烧了苗子；棉花因旱、虫危害落蕾增加。
    严重的干旱，没有吓倒关中、陕南的广大干部和人民。各地干部和社员正在找水，挖井、掏泉、拦河、闸坝、戽水、担水、车水，同干旱搏斗。早在六月旱象刚一露头时，中共陕西省委就指示受旱地区迅速展开抗旱斗争。最近省委又对全省旱情作了全面分析，对抗旱工作进一步作了部署。省委还召开了工业、商业、交通等有关部门的抗旱保秋协作会议，组织各方面力量来支援抗旱，解决灌溉机械设备的配套、材料供应等问题。
　　晋东南、晋南
    本报太原11日电  久旱不雨的晋东南山区和晋南平川，掀起了抗旱高潮。
    目前，这两个专区投入抗旱的大军共有二百四十多万人，已有二百六十多万亩干旱的秋禾得到灌溉。晋东南大部分地区组织了灌溉保苗的水利专业大军，充分发挥现有水利工程的效益，开展了合理灌溉运动。公社工业和副业占用的动力机械也投入抗旱斗争。各地还采取水车“搬家”、合流远浇、加高井台等办法，充分发挥水利设备的作用。黎城、沁县、晋城等县浇苗追肥结合进行。晋南专区的自流灌溉区有五千八百多个清水渠和一百五十余座水库，全部开闸放水，自7月下旬以来，平均每天浇地十四万亩，比抗旱前日浇五万亩的进度提高了一点八倍。运城、闻喜、侯马、芮城四个县为了解决灌溉畜力不足的问题，还组织了两万多人推水车。高垣县缺水地区车马齐上阵，通过车载、畜驮、人担运水浇苗。
    在抗旱期间，各地区互相支援。临汾县邓家庄和史村公社协作，打破了用水界限，使五百亩干旱严重的秋田迅速得到了灌溉。
    最近，中共晋东南和晋南地委又全面部署了抗旱工作，要求各地克服右倾情绪，进一步发动群众坚定人定胜天的信心，同时提出了抗旱保收的新任务。晋东南地委要求全区持续开展抗旱运动，已下雨的地区对禾苗已枯死的二十万亩秋田要迅速抢种晚秋作物和秋菜；未落雨的地区要开展一人保一亩苗运动；水利条件好的地区要加强田间管理。开展超产运动。晋南地委经过分类排队，要求干旱地区以抗旱为压倒一切的中心，掀起一个昼夜浇田的突击旬，做到滴水必争，株苗必保，水地保丰收，旱地不减产。已落雨地区，迅速开展一个“要回来，补起来，力争丰收”的群众运动，要做到旱地丢了水地补，大秋减产晚秋补，粮食丢了蔬菜补，农业丢了副业补。
    晋东南专区是山西省主要杂粮产区，晋南平川是棉、麦产区。这两个地区自7月初以来普遍干旱缺雨。据不完全统计，晋东南八百万亩大秋作物受灾面积达到了三百四十四万亩，严重地区禾苗已开始枯死。晋南地区十七个县、市受旱棉、秋田达四百多万亩，占到了总面积的40％多。为支援这两个专区的抗旱斗争，中共山西省委已抽调了大批负责干部组成抗旱检查团，在省委书记处书记王谦带领下，分赴晋南、晋东南旱灾严重的县帮助推动抗旱工作。山西省商业厅也作了紧急安排，积极加强抗旱物资供应。
