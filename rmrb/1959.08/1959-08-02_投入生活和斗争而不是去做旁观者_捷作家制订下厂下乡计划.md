    Immerse Themselves in Life and Struggle Instead of Being Bystanders
    Czech Writers Formulate Plans to Go to Factories and Countryside
    (Our Dispatch from Prague, August 1st, Reporter Lin Hai) Since the Czechoslovak Socialist Cultural Congress, the call to "get close to the working people, delve into real life, and create more literary works that reflect the great cause of socialism" has become a deeply rooted topic in Czechoslovak literary circles. Many writers have formulated new creative plans, and many are preparing to go to factories and the countryside.
    Writer Milan Jares is about to go to a cooperative in the Moravian Highlands to work as a tractor driver; poet Jija Baltert has planned to do cultural propaganda work at the Stalin Factory in Maski State; writer Jiri Benes will work in a cultural palace in Karlovy Vary, and he also plans to establish regular contact with local agricultural cooperatives; writer Miloslav Florian will go to the countryside to participate in several months of physical labor.
    Some other writers have also made plans to delve into life. Some will go to factories to work as accountants, some will go to factory newspapers to work as editors, and some will participate in a period of physical labor. Playwright Stenlik is even preparing to move his whole family to an agricultural production cooperative he is going to.
    Skala, the first secretary of the Czechoslovak Writers' Association, told reporters that no matter what work the writers who go down engage in, they must actively immerse themselves in the life and struggle of the working people and must not be bystanders. Not long ago, the Central Council of the Writers' Association also announced a resolution stipulating that a certain number of writers should go down every year. This resolution has not only been supported by the majority of writers but also welcomed by the broad masses of working people. The Writers' Association has received a large number of letters from factories, rural areas, and border areas, where people are eagerly awaiting writers to live among them.
    Strengthening the connection between writers and life and the people by all means and encouraging the creation of works with real life as the theme has become one of the important tasks of the Czechoslovak Writers' Association.
    In addition to actively supporting and organizing writers to go to the countryside and factories, the Writers' Association also organizes writers to conduct short-term visits to rural factories, hold discussions with the working people, and listen to their opinions and requirements for their works.

    投入生活和斗争而不是去做旁观者
    捷作家制订下厂下乡计划
    本报布拉格1日电　记者林海报道：自从捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会以来，“接近劳动人民，深入现实生活，创造出更多反映社会主义伟大事业的文学作品。”这一号召已成为捷克斯洛伐克文学界一个深入人心的话题。许多作家拟定了新的创作计划，不少的作家已在进行下厂下乡的准备工作。
    作家米兰·雅雷斯即将到摩拉维亚高原的一个合作社去当拖拉机手；诗人吉佳巴尔特已计划好到马斯基州斯大林工厂去做文化宣传工作；作家吉里·贝尼斯要到卡罗维发利的一个文化宫去工作，他还准备和当地的农业合作社建立经常的联系；作家米洛斯塔夫·弗罗里安要到农村去参加几个月的体力劳动。
    还有一些作家也都订了深入生活的计划，有的将到工厂去当会计，有的将到工厂的杂志报纸去当编辑，有的将去参加一个时期的体力劳动。剧作家斯腾里克还准备把全家都搬到他要去的一个农业生产合作社去。
    捷克斯洛伐克作家协会第一书记斯卡拉对记者说：这次下去的作家无论从事什么工作，都必须积极投入劳动人民的生活和斗争中去，不能做一个旁观者。不久前，作协中央理事会还公布了一项决议，规定每年有一定数量的作家下去。这一决议不仅得到大多数作家的拥护，也受到广大劳动人民的欢迎。作协收到了大量来自工厂、农村、边境地区的信件，那里的人民热烈期待作家们到他们中间去生活。
    利用一切办法加强作家与生活和人民的联系，鼓励创作以现实生活为题材的作品，已成为目前捷克斯洛伐克作家协会的重要任务之一。
    作协除了积极支持和组织作家下乡下厂的工作外，还组织作家到农村工厂进行短期访问，和劳动人民群众进行座谈，听取他们对作品的意见和要求。
