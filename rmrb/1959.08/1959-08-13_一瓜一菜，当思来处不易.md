　　A Melon, a Vegetable, Remember How Hard-Won They Are

　　Beijing area has had continuous heavy rains. According to preliminary statistics, one-third of the suburban farmland (2.2 million mu) has suffered severe waterlogging disasters. In particular, the sowing work of 430,000 mu of autumn vegetables has been greatly affected. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of all parties, suburban farmers have launched a heroic and tenacious battle against waterlogging to seize vegetables. They tried everything possible to rescue existing vegetables, drain water and sow autumn vegetables, striving to ensure the vegetable supply for millions of urban residents. From the news and pictures published today, we can see: they brave the rain to rush vegetables into the city; they rescue melons and vegetables in the water; they overcome all difficulties to plant autumn vegetables; after being washed away by the water three times, they still plant them the fourth time. This is true heroic spirit!

　　In the near future, there may be some difficulties in the supply of vegetables in the city. Difficulties need everyone's concerted efforts to overcome from both aspects of increasing production and saving. A melon, a vegetable, remember how hard-won they are. In order to be worthy of those who are working heroically and arduously in the wind and rain and in the water, everyone should not only do their work better, but also pay more attention to saving vegetables.

　　一瓜一菜，当思来处不易
    北京地区连日暴雨。据初步统计，郊区三分之一的农田（二百二十万亩）受了严重的水涝灾害。特别是使四十三万亩秋菜播种工作受到极大的影响。郊区农民在党的领导及各方支援下，展开了英勇顽强的抗涝夺菜大战。他们想尽一切办法抢救已有的蔬菜，排涝播种秋菜，力求保证对几百万城市居民的蔬菜供应。从今天发表的消息和图片中，我们可以看到：他们冒雨赶运蔬菜进城；他们在积水中抢救瓜菜；他们排除一切困难种下秋菜，三次被水冲跑了，第四次还种下去。这是真正的英雄精神！
    在今后一个短时期内，城市蔬菜供应方面可能又有些困难。困难需要大家一致努力从增产和节约两方面来克服。一瓜一菜，当思来处不易。为了无愧于那些在风雨中积水中英勇苦干的人们，大家一方面应该把工作做得更好，一方面更要注意节约吃菜。
