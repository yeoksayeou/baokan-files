Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. In the Xiangyang Special District of Hubei, wherever "watermelon vine"-style water conservancy self-flowing irrigation networks have been built, water sources are plentiful in the fight against drought. The 3 million mu of rice paddies and approximately 500,000 mu of dryland crops within the irrigated areas that receive self-flowing irrigation show a lush green color. The masses in the irrigated areas are currently vigorously expanding and repairing these irrigation networks to further expand the area of benefit and enable them to play a greater role.

Among the more than 370,000 large, medium, and small water conservancy facilities in the Xiangyang Special District, more than 260,000 have basically formed "watermelon vine"-style water systems connecting rivers to dams, dams to canals, and canals to weirs and ponds. Because these water conservancy facilities can store water year-round, and river water flows into canals and weirs by gravity, many ponds and weirs are still full of water despite the fact that there has been little rainfall in this area for more than two months. Of the more than 4 million mu of rice and dryland crops irrigated by these water systems (accounting for more than 26% of the total area of various crops in the district), approximately 3.5 million mu still receive self-flowing irrigation. Other farmland can also be irrigated by extracting water from weirs and ponds and other means.

Zhaogang Commune (formerly a township) in Guanghua County, Xiangyang Special District, was the first place to create the "watermelon vine"-style water conservancy self-flowing irrigation network in the winter of 1956. The Du Cao River within the commune's territory is only 25 kilometers long, and the river's annual flow is only 0.06 cubic meters per second. According to past water conservancy project designs, this river water would only be enough for 600 mu of rice paddies. However, through their creative construction, they built dams along the river in sections, dug canals, built ponds, stored water year-round, and created a "watermelon vine"-style water conservancy self-flowing irrigation system, greatly expanding the area of benefit. Up and down this river, they built a total of 30 simple river dams and a medium-sized dammed reservoir, opened 31 mountain canals with a total length of more than 110 kilometers, and built 77 "watermelon weirs," guaranteeing the water use of more than 6,300 mu of rice paddies this year. Despite the fact that it has not rained for two months, this river still flows day and night, providing self-flowing irrigation to more than 90% of the rice paddies. Zao Yang County built two long canals, east and west, upstream of the Sha River. The main canal of the west canal is as long as 128 kilometers, and the main canal of the east canal is as long as 79 kilometers. The two long canals connect nearly 6,000 large and small ponds, weirs, and reservoirs, which can guarantee the irrigation of about 100,000 mu of farmland. The Baili Long Canal in Yicheng County, the first to be built in Hubei Province in 1952, could only irrigate 48,000 mu when it was completed, but expanded to 100,000 mu in the four years until 1956. However, after learning from the successful experience of the "watermelon vine"-style water network in the past two years, a large number of permanent water storage projects have been expanded and built along the main and branch lines of the long canal. This year, the irrigation area of this long canal has increased to about 300,000 mu. When people walk through the irrigated area and see that the water source is so abundant and the seedlings are growing well, they simply cannot believe that this is a place where it has not rained for a month or two.

The people of Xiangyang Special District are not satisfied with their existing achievements. They are doing everything possible to tap the potential of existing water conservancy facilities. The special district has repaired and newly built more than 17,000 water diversion canals in the recent drought resistance efforts. Because these projects mostly use favorable terrain to dig canals to divert river water or reservoir water, they take less time, require less labor, have sufficient water sources, and have great benefits. According to statistics from 40 larger water systems among them, the newly expanded irrigation area has reached more than 160,000 mu.

    襄阳专区灌溉网在抗旱中大显身手
    几百万亩一片碧绿，简直不像一两个月没有下雨的地方
    新华社武汉7日电　湖北襄阳专区修了“西瓜秧”式水利自流灌溉网的地方，在抗旱斗争中水源充足，灌区内得到自流灌溉的三百万亩水稻和五十万亩左右旱地作物，禾苗呈现一片青绿。灌区群众目前正大力扩修这些灌溉网，进一步扩大受益面积，使它们发挥更大的作用。
    襄阳专区现有的三十七万多处大、中、小型水利设施中，有二十六万多处基本上形成了河连坝、坝连渠、渠连堰塘的“西瓜秧”式水利系统。由于这种水利设施能常年蓄水，河水自流进渠进堰，因此这一带虽然已有两个多月雨水稀少，许多塘堰仍然蓄满了水。由这种水利系统灌溉的四百多万亩水稻和旱地作物（占全区各种作物总面积26％以上）中，有三百五十万亩左右仍然得到了自流灌溉，其他农田也可以从堰塘中采取提水等措施灌溉。
    襄阳专区光化县的赵岗公社（原为乡），是1956年冬首创“西瓜秧”式水利自流灌溉网的地方。公社境内的杜槽河，全长只有二十五公里，河水常年流量只有零点零六秒立方米，如按过去的水利工程设计，这条河水只够六百亩稻田用，但是经过他们创造性的建设，在沿河节节修坝，开渠修塘，常年蓄水，修成了“西瓜秧”式的水利自流灌溉系统，受益面积大大扩展。在这条河道上下，他们共修了三十道简易河坝和一座中型拦河水库，开辟了三十一条总长一百一十多公里的盘山渠，修筑了七十七个“西瓜堰”，今年保证了六千三百多亩稻田的用水。尽管已有两个月未下雨，这条河现在仍然日夜流水潺潺，使90％以上的稻田得到了自流灌溉。枣阳县在沙河上游修起东西两条长渠，西渠的干渠长达一百二十八公里，东渠干渠长达七十九公里，两条长渠共联结了大小塘堰、水库近六千处，可以保证十万亩左右农田灌溉。1952年湖北省最早动工兴建的宜城县百里长渠，建成时只能灌到四万八千亩，到1956年四年间扩展到十万亩。但是经过近两年来吸取“西瓜秧”式水利网的成功经验，沿长渠的干线支线扩修了大批常年蓄水的工程设施，今年这条长渠的灌溉面积已增加到三十万亩左右。当人们从灌溉区走过，看到水源这样充足，禾苗长得很好，简直不相信这里会是一两个月没有下雨的地方。
    襄阳专区的人民群众并不满足已有的成就，他们正在千方百计地发掘现有水利设施的潜力。全专区在最近抗旱中补修和新修的引水渠道就有一万七千多条，因为这些工程大多利用有利地形开渠引河水或水库水，费时短、花工少、水源足，受益很大。据其中四十处较大水利系统统计，新扩大的灌溉面积即达十六万多亩。
