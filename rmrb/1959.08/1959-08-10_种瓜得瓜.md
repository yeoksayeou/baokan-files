What You Sow is What You Reap
　　Wherever water conservancy projects have been built extensively and well in the past few years, there have been significant changes in the appearance of agricultural production. In this year's fight against drought, we can see more clearly the power of the water conservancy projects built in the past. People call the reservoirs, ponds, and canals that are connected together "long vines bearing melons"; now, it is truly "what you sow is what you reap." The hard work of vigorously developing water conservancy in those years is increasingly blossoming and bearing fruit. These facts fully demonstrate that natural disasters are not to be feared. This year, the masses' demands for water conservancy will definitely become more urgent, and the will to fight disasters will inevitably turn to vigorously developing water conservancy. In areas where water conservancy has not been built extensively or well, the people's fighting spirit should be encouraged in the fight against drought, and more new or renovated water conservancy projects should be built. We should also make plans early for how to continue vigorously developing water conservancy this winter and next spring.

    种瓜得瓜
    凡是过去几年水利工程修得又多又好的地方，农业生产的面貌都有了很大的变化。在今年的抗旱斗争中，可以更清楚地看到过去兴修的水利工程在发挥威力。人们把一些大大小小连成一气的水库水塘水渠叫做“长藤结瓜”；现在，真是“种瓜得瓜”，当年大兴水利的辛勤的劳动，越来越多地开花结果了。这些事实充分地说明了天灾不足畏。今年，群众对于水利的要求一定会更加迫切，抗灾的意志必然会转向大兴水利。在水利修得还不多或者修得不好的地方，在抗旱中应该激励群众的斗志，新修或整修更多的水利工程。今冬明春怎样继续大兴水利，也应该早作打算了。
