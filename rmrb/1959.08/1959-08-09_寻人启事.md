    In Search Of
    Ying Xuan

    Recently, a strange "In Search Of" notice was posted on the bulletin board of our office. It read:

      To Whom It May Concern: The pile of coal dross in front of our office building has been gradually increasing lately. It seems that someone has been picking it up from the pile of coal slag behind the kitchen every day. Picking up coal dross to save raw coal is commendable. But who is this person quietly picking up coal dross? We have inquired in various departments several times, but to no avail. The office is about to hold a meeting of advanced workers in increasing production and practicing economy, and we plan to invite the coal dross picker to attend. We hope that this comrade will come forward to register as soon as possible. Anyone who knows the name of this comrade is requested to inform us immediately.
            Office of the Organization

    The "In Search Of" notice has been posted for several days, and although the pile of coal dross seems to be still increasing, the coal dross picker is still nowhere to be found. How strange!

    One day, I was eating in the canteen when, through the open window of the kitchen, I saw a peasant-dressed old man talking to Xiao Wang, the cook in charge of the boiler and cooking. This old man had a ruddy face, a purplish chest, and a long, white beard. He was full of energy and talking and laughing. I only heard him say to Xiao Wang, "Young man, don't look down on firing the boiler and cooking! There's knowledge in it! Understand? When adding coal, add it frequently and in small amounts. The boiler should be cleaned often to allow the coal to burn as thoroughly as possible. But no matter how thoroughly you burn the coal, there will still be some coal dross in the slag. You have to be frugal and pick it up when you have time. Isn't that right? Our factories and mines use a lot of coal, and everyone has to be careful to save it..."

    Xiao Wang listened intently, his face flushed by the raging fire, his back bare, and his sweat dripping. The old man wiped Xiao Wang's back with a towel, smiling so that his eyes narrowed, and said, "Diligence and frugality are our true colors. Young people! Learn to manage your life, and you'll marry a good wife in the future." With that, he laughed heartily and left.

    I asked Xiao Wang who this old man was. Xiao Wang told me that his name was Li Yuegui, the father of Section Chief Li of the finance section. He had come to see his son and had been in the office for more than ten days. He was going home tomorrow because Xiao Wang and Section Chief Li were from the same village, so he came to say goodbye to Xiao Wang. "Hey! This old man is almost seventy years old, but look at his energy! Everyone in our area knows him as 'Fire God'!" Xiao Wang said, "Before liberation, he farmed for the landlord 'Black Miser.' That year, the crops were abundant, but the grain earned by the sweat of the poor was all given to 'Black Miser' as rent. Grandpa Yuegui couldn't stand it, so one night, he dug a hole and set fire to 'Black Miser's' warehouse, burning all of 'Black Miser's' grain and money to a crisp! Afterward, he took his family and闯关东 (literally "闖關東," means to venture into Northeast China). He didn't come home until after liberation! In those days, people spread the word like a myth: Fire God stood up for the poor. Later, people called him 'Grandpa Fire God'!"

    "What is he doing in the village now?"

    "When the People's Commune was established, they originally wanted him to live in the nursing home, but he didn't want to. He wanted to fire the boiler for the commune canteen. He gave himself a job title, called 'Boiler Fireman.' He's been in our office for more than ten days, and he's worried about the pile of coal in his canteen! He said he didn't cover it with matting when he left, and he's afraid it will be washed away by the rain and wasted."

    A few days later, I don't know if the coal dross picker in the office was found. But this afternoon, I was walking behind the building when I saw Section Chief Li's son, Li Xiaolin, who was about ten years old, picking up coal dross with a basket in front of a pile of coal slag. The child was bent over, not even lifting his head, looking so serious and likable! I said, "Xiaolin! So you're the one who's been picking up coal dross for our office!"

    Xiaolin looked up at me, but didn't answer my question. He just said, "Uncle, come on, let's pick it up together! There's a lot of coal dross here! You see, when my grandpa was here, he picked it up every day, but he didn't finish it. Grandpa left and gave me the task; Grandpa said: as long as I finish picking up the coal dross in this pile of slag, he will bring me two white rabbits!" (with picture)

### 寻人启事

    寻人启事
    应选
    最近，我们机关布告栏里张贴出一张奇怪的寻人启事，上面写道：
      敬启者：本机关门前那堆煤核，近来逐渐增多。看来，是
    有人天天从伙房后面那堆煤渣堆里捡来的。捡煤核，节约原
    煤，值得表扬。但这个悄悄捡煤核者是谁呢？在各部门查询数
    次，终没查出。最近，机关即将召开增产节约积极分子会议，
    拟邀捡煤核者参加，希该同志速来报到。知该同志姓名者，
    请速告知。
            机关办公室启
    寻人启事贴出好几天，虽然那堆煤核似乎还在增多，但捡煤核者仍无下落，真怪！
    这天，我在食堂吃饭，透过伙房敞开的那个大窗户，瞧见一个农民打扮的老汉，正在和专管烧锅炉做饭的炊事员小王谈些什么。这老汉，赤红脸，紫胸脯，花白的长须，神采奕奕，谈笑风生。只听他对小王说：“小伙子，别轻看烧锅做饭啊！这里面，也有学问哩！懂吗？添煤时，要勤添、少添，锅炉要常掏，让煤尽量烧透。不过任你把煤烧得再透，煤渣里总还有些煤核。这就得勤俭点，抽工夫捡捡。不是么，咱这儿厂厂矿矿的，用煤多，大伙得精心节约呀……”
    小王听得出神，熊熊炉火映红了脸，脱得光脊梁，汗水涔涔。老汉一边讲着，拿出手巾，给小王背上擦拭几下，笑得两眼眯?，说：“勤俭二字，是咱的本色。青年人啊！学会过日子吧，将来娶个好媳妇。”说着，呵呵大笑着走了。
    我向小王打听这个老汉是谁。小王告诉我说，他叫李月桂，是财务科李科长的父亲，看儿子来的，在机关呆了十多天，明天要回家了，因为小王和李科长他们是同乡，所以他特来向小王告别。“嘿！这个老汉，年近七十了，你瞧他那股子精神，多旺啊！我们那儿十里八里的，谁不知他外号叫‘火神爷’！”小王说：“解放前，他给地主‘黑财迷’种地。那一年，庄稼丰收了，穷人们的血汗换来的粮食，都给‘黑财迷’交了地租。月桂大爷吃不了这口气，一天夜里，打了个地洞，在‘黑财迷’仓库里点一把火，把‘黑财迷’家粮食钱财烧的精溜光！事后，他带着家小闯了关东，直到解放后才家来呀！当年，人们像神话似的传诵：是火神爷替穷人打不平。后来人们就这么管他叫‘火神爷爷’了！”
    “现在，他在村里干啥呀？”
    “成立人民公社，本来让他住敬老院；可是，他不住，要给公社食堂烧锅。他给自己起了个职务名称，叫什么‘烧锅员’。在咱机关呆了十多天，就挂念他食堂那堆煤啦！说临来时没给盖几张席子，怕给雨水冲淋，损耗了。”
    过了几天，机关里的捡煤核者是否有了下落，我不知道。不过这天下午，我在屋后散步，只见李科长一个十来岁的儿子李小林，提着篮儿，在一堆煤渣跟前捡煤核。孩子弓着腰，头也不抬，那个认真的样儿，真叫人喜欢！我说：“小林！原来给我们机关捡煤核的是你呀！”
    小林抬头看看我，没有回答我的问题，只说：“叔叔，来，咱一块儿捡呀！这里的煤核，可多哩！你瞧，我爷爷在这儿的时候，天天来捡，都没捡完。爷爷走了，把任务交给了我；爷爷说：只要我把这堆煤渣里的煤核捡完了，他就给我捎来两只小白兔！”（附图片）
