Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Liaison Committee today sent a telegram to the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, congratulating it on its success. The telegram stated that people all over the world unanimously demand a halt to testing and a ban on the use of nuclear weapons, and resolutely oppose the threat of nuclear war. People are watching the United States with unease, as it persists in refusing to reach an agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons despite the common aspirations of peace-loving people, and continues to expand nuclear weapons bases on foreign soil, transporting various atomic weapons to many countries. Recently, it has also stepped up the formation of new military blocs and actively engaged in aggressive activities, exacerbating international tensions and threatening peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

The telegram also stated that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Liaison Committee has always opposed the threat of nuclear war and advocated reaching an agreement on a permanent cessation of testing and a ban on the use of nuclear weapons. We support the proposal to establish a zone of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Far East and Pacific region. We are willing to work together with peace-loving people all over the world to eliminate the threat of nuclear war and safeguard world peace and human security.

    亚洲及太平洋和委会电贺广岛大会成功
    据新华社3日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会今天打电报给第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，祝贺大会成功。电文说，全世界人民一致要求停止试验、禁止使用核武器，坚决反对核战争威胁。人们不安地注视着美国，它不顾爱好和平的人民的共同愿望，仍坚持拒绝就禁止核武器达成协议，并继续在外国土地上扩建核武器基地，把各种原子武器运到许多国家去。最近还加紧拼凑新的军事集团和积极进行侵略活动，加剧国际紧张局势，威胁着亚洲及太平洋地区和世界的和平和安全。
    电文又说，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会一向反对核战争威胁，主张就永久停止试验和禁止使用核武器达成协议。我们支持建立远东及太平洋区域和平与无核武器地区的建议。我们愿同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为消除核战争威胁和维护世界和平与人类的安全而共同努力。
