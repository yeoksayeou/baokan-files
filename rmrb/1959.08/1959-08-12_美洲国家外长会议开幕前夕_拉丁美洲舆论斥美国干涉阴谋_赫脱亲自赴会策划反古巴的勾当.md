Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the eve of the Conference of Foreign Ministers of American States, instigated by the United States with the aim of plotting intervention in Cuba, Latin American public opinion is condemning the American interventionist conspiracy. The conference will be held on August 12 in Santiago, the capital of Chile.

The Cuban Cabinet decided on the afternoon of August 9 to send a delegation headed by Minister of State Raúl Roa to attend the conference.

Raúl Roa said after the Cabinet meeting: "We are attending the conference to defend all the views we have put forward in the Organization of American States."

Prior to this, Cuban President Dorticós, speaking at a press conference on August 7 about the American Foreign Ministers' Conference, stated that Cuba would oppose any interference in Cuba's internal affairs. He said that Cuba's representatives attending any conference would defend human rights and political independence, and advocate the elimination of hunger. If Cuba attends the Foreign Ministers' Conference, it will re-propose a discussion of the economic backwardness of Latin American countries.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter departed from Washington on August 10 for Santiago, Chile, to attend the American Foreign Ministers' Conference. Herter made a statement at the airport before his departure. His words once again exposed the United States' intentions in instigating this American Foreign Ministers' Conference. Herter said: "In the past few months, we (the United States) have become increasingly concerned about the political tensions developing in the Caribbean," and he called on the American Foreign Ministers' Conference to "frankly examine these tensions" and "take mutually agreed measures to deal with this situation."

In his speech, Herter described the "Organization of American States," a tool consistently used by the United States to invade and interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, as an organization that has "always been engaged in fruitful international cooperation in the pursuit of security, peace, and progress." He said that the "Organization of American States" has accumulated long-term experience, and that the "experience" and "determination" of this Pan-American system will be of "great help" in resolving the tasks set by this conference.

Herter's remarks foreshadow that the United States, as revealed by widespread Latin American public opinion, will use the American Foreign Ministers' Conference to conduct political mobilization, plot interventionist conspiracies, attempt to create a replica of the "Guatemalan event" in Cuba, and thereby intensify the suppression of national independence movements in the Latin American region.

Latin American public opinion has repeatedly pointed out that the United States is actively planning this conference in order to create a pretext for intervention in Cuba. When the Council of the "Organization of American States" discussed the agenda of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, it requested that the Foreign Ministers' Conference "consider the political tensions in the Caribbean with reference to the principles and standards of the Pan-American system." In 1954, the United States accused Guatemala of not conforming to the "Pan-American system" at the Pan-American Conference and launched armed intervention against Guatemala.

The Uruguayan "Adelante" weekly pointed out that American monopoly capital and the U.S. State Department are colluding with Cuban traitors, former Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz and former President Urrutia, planning to have the "Organization of American States" interfere in Cuba's internal affairs under the guise of opposing the "communist threat." The weekly said that these people know very well that there is no "communist threat" in Cuba; they just want to oppose land reform because land reform touches the interests of American companies and Cuban feudal lords.

The "Adelante" weekly went on to point out that the United States, with the support of the Somoza family, Trujillo, and other dictators in Latin America, is attempting to pass resolutions on establishing "international police forces" in order to use them to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. The weekly wrote, after recalling that the United States had also made such preparations on the eve of its intervention in Guatemala: "The shadow of Guatemala's fate closely follows Cuba."

The Uruguayan "Popular Newspaper" also condemned the United States' intention to use the American Foreign Ministers' Conference to prepare for military intervention in Cuba. The newspaper wrote, "Wherever the dollar goes, so does the American flag. For the U.S. government, nothing is more sacred than American investment in semi-colonies and dependent countries." The newspaper wrote that therefore, as long as any Latin American country rises up to fight for political and economic independence, thereby touching the interests of foreign capitalists, all kinds of pressure will be used against it.

The Brazilian weekly "New Orientation" believes that the American Foreign Ministers' Conference "contradicts the interests of peace on the continent...it is a continuation of the imperialist policy of intervention, which may be used against us tomorrow."

　　美洲国家外长会议开幕前夕
　　拉丁美洲舆论斥美国干涉阴谋
　　赫脱亲自赴会策划反古巴的勾当
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国鼓动的目的在于策划干涉古巴阴谋的美洲国家外长会议，12日将在智利首都圣地亚哥举行。
    古巴内阁会议9日下午决定，派遣一个以国务部长劳尔·罗亚为首的代表团出席这个会议。
    劳尔·罗亚在内阁会议结束后发表谈话说：“我们参加会议是去维护我们在美洲国家组织中所提出的一切观点。”
    在此以前，古巴总统多尔蒂科斯在7日举行的记者招待会上谈到美洲外长会议时曾经表示，古巴将反对任何干涉古巴内政的作法。他说，古巴参加任何会议的代表都将保卫人权和政治独立，主张消除饥饿。如果古巴参加外长会议，它将重新提出讨论拉丁美洲国家经济落后的问题。
    美国国务卿赫脱10日由华盛顿动身前往智利圣地亚哥，参加美洲外长会议。赫脱启程前在机场发表了声明。他的话再次暴露了美国鼓动召开这次美洲外长会议的用心。赫脱说：“在过去几个月中，我们（美国）对于在加勒比海发展的政治紧张局势越来越感到不安”，他要求美洲外长会议“坦率地研究这种紧张局势”，“采取共同同意的对付这种局势的措施”。
    赫脱在讲话中对于“美洲国家组织”这个美国一贯用以侵略和干涉拉丁美洲各国内政的工具说成“一直是为了争取安全、和平和进步而进行有成果的国际合作的”组织。他说，“美洲国家组织”已经积累了长期的经验，这种泛美制度的“经验”和“决心”对于解决这次会议所规定的任务将“有很大的帮助”。
    赫脱的这番话预示着美国将像拉丁美洲广泛舆论所揭露的那样，利用美洲外长会议进行政治动员、策划干涉阴谋，企图在古巴制造“危地马拉事件”的翻版，从而加紧镇压拉丁美洲地区的民族独立运动。
    拉丁美洲舆论曾一再指出，美国为了制造干涉古巴的借口，积极策划召开这次会议。在“美洲国家组织”理事会讨论这次外长会议的议程时，它曾要求外长会议“参照泛美体系的原则和标准来考虑加勒比海的政治紧张局势”。1954年美国曾在泛美会议上指责危地马拉不符合“泛美体系”，并对危地马拉发动了武装干涉。
    乌拉圭“前进”周刊指出，美国垄断资本和美国国务院正勾结古巴人民的叛徒前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯和前总统乌鲁蒂亚，打算在反对“共产主义威胁”的幌子下，让“美洲国家组织”来干涉古巴内政。这家周刊说，这些人明知道古巴并没有任何“共产主义威胁”，他们就是要反对土地改革，因为土地改革触及了美国公司和古巴封建主的利益。
      “前进”周刊接着指出，美国企图在索摩查家族、特鲁希略和拉丁美洲其他独裁者的支持下，通过关于建立“国际警察部队”的决议，以便用它来干涉古巴内政。这家周刊在追述美国干涉危地马拉的前夕也作过这种准备后写道：“危地马拉命运的阴影紧紧跟随着古巴。”
    乌拉圭“人民报”也谴责美国打算利用美洲外长会议来准备对古巴进行军事干涉。报纸写道，“美元去到哪里，美国国旗也去到哪里。对于美国政府来说，没有比美国在半殖民地和附属国的投资更加神圣的了。”这家报纸写道，因此只要任何一个拉丁美洲国家起来争取政治和经济独立从而触及外国资本家的利益，便对它使用各种各样的压力。
    巴西的“新方针”周刊认为美洲外长会议“同大陆的和平利益是相抵触的……，它是帝国主义干涉政策的继续，这种政策明天就有可能用来对付我们”。
