　　——Random Thoughts on Light Music Issues
　　Li Ling
    The issue of light music is a significant one in the cultural life of the masses.

    The musical life of the broad masses consists of two aspects: appreciation and playing/singing themselves. Whether it's appreciation or playing/singing, the main focus is "light music."
          ×　×　×
    The so-called "light music" refers to music that is relatively light, cheerful, lyrical, full of life's interest, and relatively easy to understand in form; this includes general songs, lyrical songs, performance songs, light operas, arias, dances, small overtures, orchestral pieces, some film songs, and general dance music, but not large-scale works such as large choruses, symphonic pieces, and oratorios.

    It is through the masses' own appreciation, or direct participation in performance, singing, and dancing. Its impact on the lives of the broad masses, enriching the cultural entertainment of millions, and enhancing people's interest in life, and even character, has a wide-ranging significance.

    People need symphonic, choral, and chamber music art, but they also need something more relaxed, intimate, lively, and interesting. Putting light music in its proper artistic position, enjoying equal artistic rights with other musical arts, is something that should be, and is necessary.

    China's light music tradition is very rich. Folk love songs, life ballads, and the vast "blowing music" and "ba yin" are all good light music; Guangdong small tunes have many relatively excellent light music pieces from the past century. Dance hall music also has some very characteristic light music, but it was later turned yellow by some decadent musicians, so the mention of "light music" makes some people feel awkward.

    I think that to eliminate the influence of those unhealthy, yellow music pieces among the masses and to meet the people's growing need for light music, the best way is to understand and grasp the musical characteristics of this area, and to create some beautiful, lyrical new works, rather than avoiding this form.

    Many great musicians, such as Beethoven, Weber, Tchaikovsky, Johann Strauss, etc., have written some beautiful dance music. Contemporary composers such as Shostakovich, Khachaturian, and Dunaevsky also wrote light operas and songs or dances, precisely because they are always enthusiastically concerned about the musical life of the broad masses.

    Constantly paying attention to improving people's morals and temperament through music on various occasions, so that they are often immersed in a musical life with healthy sentiments and lasting interest, and unconsciously cultivate a good musical preference in them, is very important. Therefore, constantly paying attention to the issue of the higher "style" of music is right, but it should not be too strict or tight.

    Otherwise, the scope will shrink smaller and smaller, and the style will become more and more esoteric (in the past, I was somewhat demanding of "Nine-Nine Sunny Days"), which can easily hinder the multi-faceted development of this nascent light music.

    Light music requires skill and the characteristics of light music. It has to "resemble"; the so-called "resemble" means that one feels that it has the sentiment of light music as soon as one hears it. For example, Liu Chi's two dance pieces in this evening's party have a rhythmic power that makes people want to dance, which is a kind of sentiment.

    Clever and elegant orchestration is also one of the characteristics of light music. The "Four Seasons Tune" played by students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music can be said to be light, delicate, and loved by everyone. It is common to see some light music lacking experience in this area, with orchestration that is both thick and "heavy," which then becomes "heavy music."
          ×　×　×
    The young and weak art of light music needs to be promoted and supported. In addition to giving it a proper view in terms of understanding and placing light music in its proper artistic position, it is also necessary to start construction from many aspects. Numerous talented composers, soloists, and orchestras need to promote it. Publishing, record pressing, and broadcasting (a lot of work has been done in this area, but it is far from enough) should quickly follow up, so that light music can grow and expand as soon as possible, and that all areas of China's musical art can bloom luxuriantly at the same time.

　　需要扶持
　　——轻音乐问题杂谈
　　李凌
    轻音乐问题，是群众文化生活中的一个重大问题。
    广大的人们的音乐生活，一是欣赏，一是自己弹奏歌唱，不管是欣赏也好，自己奏唱也好，它的对象，主要还是“轻音乐”。
          ×　×　×
    所谓“轻音乐”，是指一些比较轻巧的、明快的、抒情的、富有生活风趣，形式比较易于理解的音乐；这里包括了一般歌曲、抒情歌、表演歌、轻歌剧、咏叹调、舞曲、小序曲、管弦乐小品、部分电影歌曲、以及一般舞蹈音乐，而不是指大合唱、交响乐曲、清唱剧等大型作品。
    它是通过群众自己欣赏、或者直接参与演奏演唱、舞蹈的。其对广大人民生活的影响，充实千千万万人的文化娱乐，提高人们的生活情趣，以至品格，是有它广泛的意义。
    人们需要交响乐、合唱、室内乐艺术，也更需要轻松、亲切、活泼、有趣的东西。把轻音乐放在应有的艺术地位，享有和其他音乐艺术同等的艺术权利，这是应该的，而且是必要的。
          ×　×　×
    我国的轻音乐传统，是非常丰富的，民间的情歌、生活谣曲、广大的“吹歌”“八音”，都是很好的轻音乐；广东小曲，有许多是近百年来比较优异的轻音乐。舞厅音乐，有些也是很有特色的轻音乐，只是后来被一些没落的音乐工作者把它黄色化了，因而一提起“轻音乐”，就使得有些人的心里感到别扭。
    我想，我们要扫除那些不健康的黄色音乐在群众中的影响，满足人民日益增长的轻音乐的需要，最好的方法，是了解和掌握这方面的音乐特点，创作一些优美的抒情的新作，而不是避开这种形式。
    许多大音乐家，像贝多芬、韦伯、柴可夫斯基、约翰·斯特劳斯等人，都曾写过一些优美的舞曲，当代作曲家像萧斯塔可维奇、哈恰图良、杜那耶夫斯基也写了轻歌剧和歌曲或舞曲，这也正因为他们时刻热心关切广大人民音乐生活的缘故。
        ×　×　×
    时刻注意通过各种场合，借音乐以提高人们的品德和气质，使之经常熏陶在一些情调健康，趣味永隽的音乐生活里，在不知不觉中培养他们有一种良好的音乐喜好，这是很重要的，因此时刻注意音乐较高的“格调”问题是对的，但也不宜过严过紧。
    不然，范围越缩越小，格调越谈越玄（过去我对“九九艳阳天”就有些苛求），就容易妨碍这新生的轻音乐的多方面的发展。
          ×　×　×
    轻音乐需要技巧，需要有轻音乐的特点。要“像”，所谓“像”，就是一听就感到它有轻音乐的情趣，像这次晚会中刘炽的两首舞曲，就有催人欲舞的律动力，这是情趣的一种。
    编配巧雅，这也是轻音乐特点之一。上海音乐学院学生演奏的“四季调”，可以说是轻巧秀丽，众人欢爱。常见有一些轻音乐，在这方面，缺乏经验，编配得既浓又“重”，那就变成“重音乐”了。
          ×　×　×
    年轻幼弱的轻音乐艺术，需要提倡，需要扶持，这就除了在认识上应给以确当的看法，把轻音乐放在应有的艺术地位之外，还要从许多方面着手建设，需要众多的有才能的作曲家、独唱独奏家、乐队提倡，出版、灌制唱片、广播（这方面做了不少工作，但远远不够。）应迅速跟上来。使轻音乐尽快成长、扩展，使我国音乐艺术中各方面的领域，同时开出茂盛之花。
