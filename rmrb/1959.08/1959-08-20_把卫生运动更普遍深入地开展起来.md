　　Launch the Hygiene Movement More Universally and Deeply

　　In the first half of this year, the patriotic hygiene movement in most areas was carried out very well. Generally, it was combined with production, with both blitz work and regular work being carried out, and great achievements were made. After the beginning of summer, many areas further launched a summer hygiene movement centered on eliminating flies and preventing diseases, and achieved significant results. Now, on this basis, we should continue to exert our efforts and launch the patriotic hygiene movement more universally and deeply.
　　August and September are the decisive months for completing and overfulfilling this year's production and construction plans. On the economic front, a vigorous movement to increase production and practice thrift is being pushed to a new climax. In order to ensure the completion of production tasks, hygiene work must be done better to prevent and reduce the occurrence of diseases, protect the people's health, and improve labor attendance and labor efficiency.
　　Autumn is a season when infectious diseases are prone to occur. Since the beginning of summer this year, the climate has been very abnormal. Some areas are experiencing drought, with prolonged periods without rain, which is conducive to the growth of flies; other areas have excessive rain and flooding, which is conducive to the breeding of mosquitoes. Drought-stricken areas are prone to heatstroke, and in areas with excessive rain,粪便污物 are likely to contaminate drinking water sources. These are all factors that can lead to the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases. Under these circumstances, if hygiene work is not done well, infectious diseases may occur and spread, which will have a serious impact on production and construction. Therefore, at present, while vigorously promoting the movement to increase production and practice thrift and launching the struggle against disasters, we must also grasp and do a good job in eliminating pests and diseases.
　　Some people now have the view that "production is so busy that carrying out a hygiene movement will affect production." This view is incorrect. We must thoroughly eliminate this fear of difficulty and slackening of effort among some cadres. On August 29, 1958, the Party Central Committee clearly pointed out in the "Decision on Continuing to Launch the Movement to Eliminate the Four Pests": "Eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases are fundamental and important measures to enhance the people's physical fitness, protect labor power, and improve labor efficiency. In order to ensure the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene should also make a great leap forward." Over the years, there have been many examples of increased production due to good hygiene, whether in industry or agriculture. Conversely, there have also been many lessons learned from the impact on production due to poor hygiene. In individual places, due to insufficient attention to hygiene in collective living places such as construction sites, breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies were not seriously eliminated,粪便垃圾 was not properly disposed of, drinking water was not disinfected, and attention was not paid to food hygiene. In addition, the epidemic situation was not reported and dealt with in a timely manner, resulting in many people becoming ill, reducing attendance and labor efficiency, and affecting production. These examples show that in times of busy production and labor, it is a necessary condition for doing a good job in production to cooperate with production, do a good job in hygiene, protect the health of workers, and improve labor attendance and labor efficiency.
　　In fact, as long as the leadership makes proper overall arrangements and closely integrates hygiene work with production, carrying out a hygiene movement will not hinder production. The examples of many advanced hygiene units also being advanced production units show that it is entirely possible to carry out hygiene activities in conjunction with production. For example, in industry, combining construction site hygiene with safe production; in agriculture, combining manure accumulation and fertilizer production with improving environmental hygiene and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and combining field management to protect seedlings and crops with eliminating rats and sparrows, are all very effective and sustainable methods. This spring, many areas seized the high tide of manure accumulation to carry out activities such as "hygiene villages" and "hygiene households," which not only improved hygiene but also increased fertilizer accumulation, which was not only a double benefit but also had the effect of doing twice the work with half the effort.
　　To make the autumn hygiene movement better and achieve practical results, the key lies in arousing the enthusiasm of the masses, firming up the confidence that "man will conquer nature," and actively participating in the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene, forming a mass upsurge of eliminating pests and diseases. At present, some cadres have a paralyzing and slackening mentality, which is very detrimental to further eliminating diseases and pests. Party and government leaders at all levels must immediately take action, and while grasping the leadership of industrial and agricultural production and the work of the people's communes, include the movement to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene on the agenda, take effective measures, and strengthen the inspection and leadership of this movement. It is necessary to educate cadres and publicize to the masses so that they clearly understand the relationship between hygiene and production, and cannot be satisfied with the achievements already made, but must take advantage of the victory to pursue and seize greater victories.
　　The focus of the autumn hygiene movement should be on eliminating mosquitoes and flies, vigorously preventing and controlling autumn infectious diseases, and protecting the health of the working people. It is necessary to strengthen the hygiene work of collective places such as people's communes, factories, mines, construction sites, nurseries, and kindergartens, and the hygiene management of canteens and the catering industry. Breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies should be eliminated, water sources should be protected, drinking water should be disinfected, and hygiene work should be done well in areas affected by floods and droughts. The rural hygiene movement should be combined with protecting seedlings and crops and eliminating rats and sparrows. In the south, efforts should be actively organized to eliminate parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, malaria, hookworm disease, filariasis, and kala-azar.
　　To enthusiastically launch an autumn hygiene blitz movement nationwide is a major task related to promoting the autumn production upsurge and controlling autumn infectious diseases. We must seize the opportunity, and action should not be delayed. Recently, cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and provinces such as Hunan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu have already made combat deployments for further launching the autumn hygiene movement. Some provinces and cities have already set off a climax of eliminating pests and diseases. All parts of the country should immediately take action, widely mobilize the masses, and launch the autumn hygiene movement vigorously and solidly, creating greater and better achievements in eliminating pests and diseases, and welcoming the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

### 把卫生运动更普遍深入地开展起来

　　把卫生运动更普遍深入地开展起来
    今年上半年，大多数地区的爱国卫生运动开展的很好，一般都结合生产抓了突击工作也抓了经常工作，成绩很大。入夏以后，许多地区又进一步开展了以灭蝇防病为中心的夏季卫生运动，又取得显著的效果。现在应该在这个基础上，继续鼓足干劲，把爱国卫生运动更普遍更深入地开展起来。
    8、9两个月，是完成和超额完成今年生产建设计划的决定性的季节。在经济战线上，一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，正在推向新的高潮。为了保证生产任务的完成，就要求卫生工作做的更好，防止和减少疾病的发生，保护人民的身体健康以提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率。
    秋季正是传染病容易发生的季节。今年入夏以来，气候很不正常，有些地区干旱，久不下雨，有利于苍蝇生长；有些地区则多雨成涝，有利于蚊子孳生。干旱地区容易发生中暑，多雨地区粪便污物容易污染饮用水源。这些都是传染病发生流行的因素。在这种情况下，如果卫生工作搞得不好，传染病就可能发生和流行，给生产建设带来严重的影响。因此，当前必须在大搞增产节约运动和展开抗灾斗争的同时，也把除害灭病工作抓紧抓好。
    现在有些人有这样的看法：“生产这样忙，搞卫生运动会影响生产。”这种看法是不正确的。必须彻底消除某些干部中的这种畏难松劲情绪。1958年8月29日，党中央在“关于继续展开除四害运动的决定”中曾经明确的指出：“除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病、是增强人民体质、保护劳动力、提高劳动效率的一项带根本性的重要措施。为了保障工农业生产大跃进，除四害，讲卫生运动也应该大跃进。”历年来，由于搞好卫生增加生产的事例，不论工业或农业方面都是很多的。相反的，由于卫生没有搞好而影响生产的教训也不少。个别地方由于对工地等集体生活场所卫生注意不够，蚊蝇孳生场所未认真清除，粪便垃圾处理得不好，饮水没有消毒和没有注意饮食卫生，加以发现疫情没有及时报告和处理，结果有不少人发生疾病，降低了出勤率和劳动效率，影响生产。这些事例说明，在生产劳动忙碌的时候，配合生产，搞好卫生，保护劳动者的健康，提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率，正是搞好生产的必要条件。
    事实上，只要领导上统筹安排得当，将卫生工作与生产密切结合起来，开展卫生运动并不会妨碍生产。许多卫生先进单位同时又是生产先进单位的事例表明，结合生产进行卫生活动完全是可能的。如工业方面，将工地卫生与安全生产结合起来；农业方面将积肥造肥与改善环境卫生、铲除蚊蝇孳生地结合起来，田间管理保苗护粮与灭鼠灭雀结合起来等等，都是非常有效的，而且是可以坚持经常的办法。今年春季，许多地区抓住积肥高潮开展“卫生村”“卫生之家”等等活动，既搞好了卫生，又增积了肥料，不仅是一举两得，而且有事半功倍之效。
    要把秋季卫生运动搞得更好，获得实际效果，关键在于鼓起广大群众的干劲，坚定“人定胜天”的信心，积极投入到除四害、讲卫生的运动，形成一个除害灭病的群众性热潮。现在，在部分干部中存在着麻痹松劲的思想情绪，这对于进一步消灭病害是非常不利的。各级党政领导要立即动手，在抓紧领导工农业生产和人民公社工作的同时，把除四害、讲卫生运动列入议程之内，采取有效措施，加强对这一运动的检查和领导。要教育干部并向群众宣传，使他们明确认识卫生与生产之间的关系，不能满足于已经取得的成就，要乘胜猛追夺取更大的战果。
    秋季卫生运动的重点应放在消灭蚊蝇上，大力预防和控制秋季传染病，保护劳动人民的健康。要加强对人民公社、厂矿、工地、托儿所、幼儿园等集体场所的卫生工作和食堂、饮食行业的卫生管理。应当消灭蚊蝇孳生场所，保护水源，实行饮水消毒，并做好水旱灾区的卫生工作。农村的卫生运动要结合护苗保粮消灭鼠雀。在南方要积极组织力量，消灭血吸虫病、疟疾、钩虫病、丝虫病、黑热病等寄生虫病。
    在全国范围内热烈的掀起一个秋季卫生突击运动，是一项关系促进秋季生产高潮和控制秋季传染病的重大任务。必须抓紧时机，行动不容迟缓。最近，北京、上海、天津等市和湖南、四川、山西、山东、江苏等省已经为进一步开展秋季卫生运动作了战斗部署。一些省、市已经掀起除害灭病的高潮。全国各地都应当立即行动起来，广泛发动群众，把秋季卫生运动轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实地开展起来，在除害灭病方面创造出更大更好的成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
