    Our Doubts

    The article "On the Field Management of Sweet Potatoes" states that turning the sweet potato vines will reduce production, which we doubt.

    (1) We have a lot of rain here, and the sweet potato vines grow particularly lush, already showing signs of excessive vegetative growth. Turning the vines can control this excessive growth. If we don't turn the vines, what should we do about the excessive growth?

    (2) The sweet potato research institute advocates not turning the vines, emphasizing the absorption of nutrients by the sweet potatoes. However, we know that crops need light, heat, nutrients, and water. Not turning the vines leads to excessive water accumulation in the soil, which is detrimental to sweet potato growth. Furthermore, not turning the vines results in dense foliage that blocks sunlight and lowers soil temperature, which is also unfavorable for yield.

    (3) In 1958, the Shiqiao Agricultural Technology Station in our county conducted a comparative experiment on two plots in the Patriotic Cooperative, one with vine turning and one without. The plot with two vine turnings yielded 3,957 catties per mu, while the plot without vine turning, due to excessive vegetative growth, yielded only 1,833 catties per mu, and the sweet potatoes were very small. How do you explain this fact?

    我们的怀疑
    “谈甘薯田间管理问题”一文中说，甘薯翻藤要减产，我们有些怀疑。
    （一）我们这里雨水多，甘薯藤叶生长特别茂密，已经产生徒长现象，而翻藤可以控制徒长。如果不翻藤，徒长怎么办呢？
    （二）甘薯研究所提倡不翻藤的理由，从甘薯对养料的吸收方面强调得多。但是我们知道，作物所需要的有光、热、养料、水，不翻藤土壤积水多，对甘薯生长就不利；不翻藤，藤叶茂密遮了阳光，土壤温度低，对产量也有不利的影响。
    （三）我县石桥农业技术站1958年在爱国社作两块翻藤与不翻藤的对比试验是：翻藤二次的亩产三千九百五十七斤；未翻藤的由于藤叶徒长，亩产只有一千八百三十三斤，而且薯块很小。这一事实又作何解释呢？
