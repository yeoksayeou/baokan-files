According to the Sichuan Daily News: The Shiyang Commune Party Committee in Huayang County, Sichuan Province, in all aspects of production and work, attaches great importance to mobilizing and organizing young people and veteran farmers. It conducts in-depth and meticulous ideological and organizational work according to their characteristics, and adopts forms such as "Youth Production Teams" and "Old Peasant Advisory Committees" to closely combine the soaring enthusiasm of young people with the rich experience of the elderly, effectively promoting various tasks.

The Commune Party Committee has always focused on youth work. In addition to assigning a Party Committee member specifically to handle youth work, the Party Committee and branches also frequently discuss youth work. According to different periods, they analyze the ideological situation of young people and propose goals and specific tasks. Since the spring plowing this year, the Party Committee has specifically discussed youth work five times based on the central tasks of each period. This has made the Communist Youth League and the broad masses of young people feel that their tasks are clear and they have great prospects in rushing to harvest, rush to plant, and manage the fields. For every meeting of League members or young people, the Party Committee secretary personally participates to tell the young people about the situation, tasks, and methods. The Party Committee believes that young people accept new things quickly and are the most revolutionary and dynamic. As long as they are grasped tightly, quickly, and specifically, they will be an invincible shock force.

In addition to frequently guiding and inspecting the work of the Communist Youth League, the Party branches and Party groups also provide specific leadership for youth work. Each management area in the commune has established youth production teams with the League as the backbone and directly led by the Party branch of the management area, using them as key points to create experience and guide the general. For example, the Huang Jiguang Youth Production Team in the Dengta Management Area has launched a high-efficiency movement, increasing transplanting efficiency by an average of two times compared to the general. The commune immediately seized on this point, vigorously promoted it, and comprehensively popularized it. As a result, a vigorous and competitive high-efficiency movement quickly emerged throughout the commune.

While encouraging the enthusiasm of young people, the Party Committee also provides meticulous care for their physical and intellectual growth. For example, the Youth League organizes them to study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and invites comrades from the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences to give lectures, etc. to meet the needs of the broad masses of young people and continuously improve their political awareness and knowledge level. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people is growing. Gu Zhengming, the secretary of the Youth League, said: "Thanks to the leadership and education of the Party, League members and young people are very obedient. Our League cadres also work very comfortably."

While focusing on youth work, the Commune Party Committee also attaches great importance to giving play to the expertise of veteran farmers. The Party Committee believes that many elderly farmers have rich production experience and farming techniques accumulated over generations, and there are many good things in this that must be carefully absorbed. The commune specially hired fifteen experienced veteran farmers to form an Old Peasant Advisory Committee, which is specifically led by Xu Yongkang, a member of the Party Committee and Deputy Director of the commune. Subsequently, each management area and production team also hired veteran farmers to form advisory groups. The entire commune hired a total of more than two hundred and forty advisors. The least experienced among them had more than thirty years of farming experience, and some were old farmers who had been farming for sixty or seventy years.

Whether it is the Commune Party Committee or the Party branch, they respect the elderly farmers very much and often educate young people to humbly learn their farming techniques and successful experiences. Whenever there are any problems in production, such as how dense the seedlings should be planted? Which field is most suitable for planting what? How should the water in the field be managed so that the seedlings grow well? How to prevent lodging, etc., they always find veteran farmers to study together. In other situations such as when studying measures to increase production, conducting certain experiments, and cadres inspecting production, veteran farmers are invited to participate and guide. Sometimes they are also organized to study and discuss new technical measures and successful experiences from other places. The commune also stipulates that a certain amount of bonus will be given for any major and feasible rationalization proposals they put forward.

The veteran farmers were very moved to see that the Party and the masses respected and trusted them so much. They actively taught production techniques to young people, voluntarily contributed their strength, and made rationalization proposals, which played a significant role in promoting production. For example, Yuan Tinglv, an advisor to the Youth Production Team in the Dengta Management Area, is a famous transplanting expert. He selflessly taught his transplanting techniques to the young people. Under his training, twenty young people skillfully mastered the transplanting techniques, and they all exceeded their master with a performance of planting more than one mu per day. Bai Fugen, whom he taught, was able to plant one mu and eight fen a day, and also won the third place in the Huayang County seedling transplanting competition. Lin Sanba, an eighty-year-old farmer in the Fengshou Management Area, suggested using tender green bamboo soaked in the fields to kill insects; Yu Xingfa in the Renhe Management Area suggested mixing cow manure, human manure, and turf together, composting it, and then using it, so that the fertilizer effect would be higher. These suggestions have been adopted and promoted by the commune, which has helped production a lot. Now, the veteran farmers are not only able to actively make suggestions on production, but they are also willing to take the initiative to talk to the cadres about problems in life.

### 大鼓青年干劲　发挥老农特长　石羊社党委善于调动一切积极因素推动生产

　　大鼓青年干劲　发挥老农特长
　　石羊社党委善于调动一切积极因素推动生产
    据四川日报消息　四川省华阳县石羊公社党委在各项生产和工作中，都非常重视发动、组织青年和老农，按照他们的特点进行深入细致的思想工作和组织工作，并采用“青年生产队”和“老农顾问委员会”等形式，把青年的冲天干劲和老年的丰富经验紧密结合在一起，有力地推动了各项工作。
    公社党委对于青年工作一直是抓得很紧的。除了派一个党委委员专门搞青年工作外，党委和支部还经常讨论青年工作。根据不同时期，分析青年们的思想情况，提出奋斗目标和具体任务。今年春耕以来，党委根据各个时期工作中心，专门讨论了五次青年工作。使共青团和广大青年在抢收抢种、田间管理等工作中，都感到任务明确，大有奔头。每次的团员或青年的大会，党委书记都亲自参加，给青年们讲形势、讲任务、讲办法等。党委认为青年接受新鲜事物快，最富有革命朝气，只要抓得紧，抓得快，抓得具体，他们就会是一支战无不胜的突击队。
    党委除了经常指导和检查共青团的工作外，党支部、党小组对青年工作也进行具体领导。公社各管区都成立有以团为骨干、由管区党支部亲自领导的青年生产队，把它作为重点来创造经验、指导一般。如灯塔管区的黄继光青年生产队，开展高工效运动使栽秧效率平均较一般提高两倍。公社立即抓住这一点，大力宣扬、全面推广。于是，在全公社很快就出现了一个轰轰烈烈、你追我赶的高工效运动热潮。
    在大鼓青年干劲的同时，党委还无微不至的关怀他们的体力和智力的成长。比如，通过青年团组织他们学习党的八届六中全会文件，请省农业科学研究所的同志来讲课等。以满足广大青年的要求，不断提高他们的政治觉悟和知识水平。因此，广大青年的干劲越来越大。团委书记辜正明说：“由于党的领导和教育，团员和青年都很听话。我们团的干部工作起来也很安逸。”
    公社党委在大抓青年工作的同时，也很重视发挥老农的特长。党委认为，在老年农民身上，很多人有着世世代代积累起来的丰富的生产经验和耕作技术，这当中有很多好的东西，必须认真汲取。公社特别聘请了十五位经验丰富的老农成立了老农顾问委员会，并由党委委员、副社长徐永康具体领导。随后，各管区和生产小队也都聘请老农成立了顾问组。全公社总计聘请了顾问二百四十多位。他们最少的都有三十多年的耕作经验，也有的是做过六、七十年农活的老庄稼人。
    不论是公社党委或党支部，对于老年农民都很尊敬，并且还经常教育青年虚心地学习他们的耕作技术和成功的经验。凡是生产上遇到了什么问题，比如：秧子到底栽多密才合适？哪块田最适于种什么？田里的水要怎样管秧子才长得好？如何防止倒伏等，总要找老农们一起研究。其它如在研究增产措施的时候，搞某种试验的时候，干部们检查生产的时候，都要请老农参加、指导。有时也还组织他们对于新的技术措施和别地成功的经验进行学习和讨论。公社还规定，凡是他们提出了较重大的、切实可行的合理化建议，还要发给一定的奖金。
    老农们看到党和群众对他们这样尊敬和信任，都很受感动。他们积极地给青年们传授生产技术，主动地贡献自己的力量，提合理化建议，对于生产起了不小的推动作用。例如灯塔管区青年生产队的顾问袁廷绿，是著名的栽秧能手。他把自己的栽秧技术毫无保留地传授给青年们。二十个青年在他的培养下熟练地掌握了栽秧技术，而且他们都以日栽一亩以上的成绩超过了师傅。他教出来的白福根一天就能够栽一亩八，还获得了华阳县秧师比赛的第三名。丰收管区八十多岁的老农林三爸，建议用嫩绿竹泡在田里杀虫；仁和管区的余兴发建议把牛粪、人粪和草皮搅在一起，沤了以后再用，这样肥效更高。……这些建议都为公社采纳和推广，对生产帮助不小。现在，老农们不光是在生产上能积极建议，就是生活上的问题，也愿意主动找干部们谈心了。
