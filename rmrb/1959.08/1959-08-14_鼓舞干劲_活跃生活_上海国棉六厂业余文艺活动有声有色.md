　　Boosting Enthusiasm and Enriching Life
　　Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 6's Amateur Cultural Activities Are Lively and Colorful
    (Our dispatch) Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 6’s mass amateur cultural activities closely coordinate with production, staging small-scale programs such as storytelling and living newspapers. Sometimes, they utilize their spare time to hold recreational evenings and gatherings, and rehearse some larger-scale programs. In this way, mass cultural activities are carried out at the rhythm of production, achieving "making way without stopping the car."

    The factory's amateur cultural troupe includes eight groups: Peking Opera, Huai Opera, Yang Opera, Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera, comic drama, Pingtan, and storytelling, with 250 core cultural members. In addition, more workers in each workshop participate in storytelling and propaganda mobilization groups. They often use fragmented time before and after meetings and during meal breaks, scattered throughout the workshops to tell stories and sing; during festivals or factory-wide cultural evenings, they gather to perform within the factory.

    Since the beginning of this year, the factory's cultural troupe has rehearsed and performed six programs, including the Peking Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," the drama "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," the Yue Opera "Happy Reunion," and the self-written and self-performed "It's Not a Fairy Descending to Earth." During the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's convening of the city-wide industrial conference, this group of cultural light cavalry also performed fast-paced and motivational short plays such as "Our Determination" and "Striving for the Red Flag" at the oath-taking rally for the socialist labor competition of all factory employees. Some cultural troupe activists even dressed up as figures such as Zhuge Liang and Wu Song, appearing on stage to tell stories and sing, expressing the determination of the employees to complete production tasks. In order to closely coordinate with production, the performance activities of the cultural troupe's various groups have now been changed to utilizing production intervals for brief storytelling activities, promoting the advanced figures and advanced deeds emerging in the socialist labor competition.

    The mass amateur cultural activities of State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 6 are not only carried out relatively regularly, but also in diverse, novel, and lively forms. The eight groups belonging to the cultural troupe perform both modern and traditional plays; they often rehearse more small-scale programs including storytelling, crosstalk, and peep shows, and also rehearse and perform some larger plays to the best of their ability. Some good programs are also performed by the workers in various forms. The "Love the Factory Like Home: Guo A'mei," which praises the model deeds of Guo A'mei, a cleaner in the factory who doesn't waste a single thread, was originally a storytelling program; after performing it several times, the workers adapted it into a dance performance, which more vividly portrayed the advanced thinking of this advanced figure, and was welcomed by the workers.

    Because the factory's amateur cultural activities are held less during busy production times and appropriately more during normal times, and are consistently carried out, the workers' performance level has significantly improved. The Huai Opera, Yang Opera, and Yue Opera groups of the cultural troupe have also established close ties with the Shanghai People's Huai Opera Troupe, Hualian Yang Opera Troupe, and Qingshan Yue Opera Troupe. Actors, directors, and playwrights from professional troupes also come to the factory to work, perform, and provide guidance for the workers' amateur performances. (Lu Zuohua He Qilie)

　　鼓舞干劲　活跃生活
　　上海国棉六厂业余文艺活动有声有色
    本报讯　上海国棉六厂的群众业余文艺活动，紧密配合生产，演出一些说唱、活报剧等小型节目；有时利用业余时间举行文娱晚会和联欢会，并排练一些比较大型的节目。这样，群众文艺活动按着生产的节奏做到了“让路不停车”。
    这个工厂的业余文工团，包括京剧、淮剧、扬剧、越剧、沪剧、滑稽话剧、评弹、说唱八个剧组，有二百五十名文艺骨干分子。此外，各车间有更多工人参加说唱、宣传鼓动小组。他们经常一道利用会前会后和饭后休息的零星时间，分散在车间里说说唱唱；到节日或者全厂举行文艺晚会时，就集中起来在厂内演出。
    今年以来，这个厂的文工团排练演出了京剧“十五贯”、话剧“智取威虎山”、越剧“喜相逢”和自编自演的“不是仙女下凡来”等六个节目。中共上海市委召开全市工业会议期间，这批文艺轻骑兵又在全厂职工社会主义劳动竞赛誓师大会上，紧锣密鼓地演唱了“我们的决心”、“争夺红旗”等富于鼓动性的小戏。有的文工团活动分子还把自己打扮成诸葛亮、武松等人物的模样，登台说唱，表达出职工完成生产任务的决心。为了紧密地配合生产，文工团各剧组的演出活动，现在改为利用生产间隙进行片刻的说唱活动，宣扬社会主义劳动竞赛中涌现出来的先进人物和先进事迹。
    国棉六厂的群众业余文艺活动，既开展得比较经常，形式也多样，新颖活泼。文工团所属的八个剧组，既演现代剧，也演传统剧；经常多排演包括说唱、相声、拉洋片等小型节目，也量力排练演出一些较大的戏。有些好节目，工人们还采用多种形式演唱。歌颂这个工厂清洁工过阿妹不浪费一根纱头模范事迹的“爱厂如家过阿妹”，原来是一个说唱节目；演了几次后，工人们又把它改编为舞蹈演出，更形象地刻划出这位先进人物的先进思想，受到工人欢迎。
    由于这个工厂的业余文艺活动，在生产忙时少搞，平时适当的多搞，坚持进行，工人们的演出水平有了显著提高，文工团的淮剧、扬剧和越剧组，还同上海市人民淮剧团、华联扬剧团和青山越剧团建立了密切联系。专业剧团的演员、导演和编剧，也到工厂边劳动、边演出，边为工人们的业余演出进行辅导。　（陆左华　何其烈）
