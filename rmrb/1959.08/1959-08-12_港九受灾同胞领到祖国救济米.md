Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 11th August. The 200,000 catties of rice allocated for the second time by the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Association have been distributed by the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to over 30,000 affected compatriots in the Kowloon and New Territories areas.

Heavy rain for four consecutive days in mid-June caused disasters for many compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. According to the Hong Kong British Information Services, the total number of affected people was 15,004. The Guangdong Branch of the Relief Association allocated 160,000 catties of rice in early July, entrusting the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to distribute it in various disaster areas in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Since the distribution began on July 14, more than 14,000 affected compatriots have received this relief rice. Later, it was found that more than 37,000 affected compatriots in the Kowloon and New Territories areas were still in difficult circumstances, so the Guangdong Branch of the Relief Association decided to allocate more rice for relief.

After this batch of rice arrived in Hong Kong in late July, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce assisted in its transfer. As of August 8, 30,876 affected compatriots in Kowloon and the New Territories had received the relief rice from their compatriots in the motherland.

　　港九受灾同胞领到祖国救济米
    新华社香港11日电　中国人民救济总会广东分会第二次拨出的二十万斤大米，已由香港中华总商会代发给九龙新界地区的三万多名受灾同胞。
    6月中旬一连四天暴雨，使香港、九龙许多同胞遭受灾害，据香港英国新闻处的公布，受灾人数总共为一万五千零四人。救济总会广东分会曾在7月上旬拨出大米十六万斤，委托香港中华总商会在港九各个灾区发放，从7月14日开始发放以来，已有一万四千多受灾同胞领到这项救济大米。后来查明，九龙新界地区还有三万七千多名受灾同胞处境困难，因此救济总会广东分会决定再拨大米救济。
    这批大米在7月下旬运到香港后，即由中华总商会协助转发。到8月8日为止，九龙新界的受灾同胞，已有三万零八百七十六人领到了祖国同胞救济的大米。
