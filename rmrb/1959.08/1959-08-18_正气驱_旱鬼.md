　　Righteousness Drives Away the "Drought Demon"

　　On August 11th, this newspaper published a news item from the Yuejin Production Team of the Lailong Commune in Luxian County, Sichuan: This team slacked off and retreated in the face of natural disasters when planting early rice this year, and the early rice yield was reduced by several thousand catties due to the disaster. Today, this newspaper is publishing another news item about the Yuejin Production Team: They accepted the lesson of the early rice yield reduction, rose up to fight the drought, and fought for grain against the heavens. They made great ambitions and took a series of measures to strive to recover the grain lost due to the drought from the autumn fields, and also to make up for the several thousand catties of grain that were under-collected in the early rice production. What heroic spirit this is! In the face of such spirit, the "drought demon" can only bow its head and hide its face and flee.

　　The facts of the Yuejin Team show that the "drought demon," like other "demons" in some ghost stories, is nothing to be afraid of as long as you are not afraid of it; the more afraid you are of it, the more it will scare you.

### 正气驱“旱鬼”

　　正气驱“旱鬼”
  　本报八月十一日发表过四川泸县来龙公社跃进生产队的一个消息：这个队今年种早稻的时候在自然灾害面前松劲退却，早稻因灾减收了几千斤。今天本报又发表了跃进生产队的消息：他们接受早稻减产的教训，奋起抗旱，与天争粮。他们立了大志，采取了一系列的措施，力争从秋田中要把因旱灾损失了的粮食拿回来，还要把在早稻生产中少收的几千斤粮食也补上。这是何等的英雄气概！在这样的气概面前，“旱鬼”只能低头掩面而逃。
    跃进队的事实说明：“旱鬼”也像一些谈“鬼”的故事中说的别的“鬼”一样，只要你不怕它，它就没什么可怕；你越怕它，它就越叫你害怕。
