    Treat Mass Movements with Full Enthusiasm
    Revolution requires the broad masses to take action. Mass movements are revolutionary movements. A person's attitude towards mass movements is the touchstone for identifying whether their revolutionary stance is firm and whether their views and methods are correct.
    We do not panic or criticize the revolutionary movements of the masses. Instead, we greet them with full enthusiasm, support them, and lead them with an active, positive, happy, and welcoming, all-out spirit, so that the mass movements achieve victory or advance along the correct path. This is the Marxist attitude of us proletarian revolutionaries towards mass movements.
    There is another attitude towards mass movements, which is the attitude of right-leaning opportunism. Those who hold this attitude, because they cannot rejoice in what the masses rejoice in, like what the masses like, and share the joys and sorrows of the masses, cannot see the achievements of the mass movements, but only see and exaggerate certain shortcomings of the mass movements. Therefore, in the face of the surging mass struggles, they always start by being alarmed and then criticize them; whenever the mass movement takes a step forward, they always take a step backward, and finally are submerged by the torrent of the mass movement. This is already a law proven by historical facts. The erroneous argument of some people at present, who slander our Great Leap Forward movement and the people's communization movement as "petty-bourgeois fanatic movements," is a concentrated expression of the right-leaning opportunist thought towards mass movements in the new situation.
    Those who adopt a right-leaning opportunist attitude towards the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization movement, their fundamental mistake lies in their disrespect for the practice of the masses, denying the correctness and inevitability of the mass movement, and attempting to pull the masses backward. The reason why Marxists put all their sympathy and support on the side of the masses is by no means to blindly defend the masses, but because the emergence of every mass movement is not an accidental phenomenon, but a regular product of the development of the political and economic situation in a certain period; the task of revolutionaries is to see this inevitability and correctness, and to actively and enthusiastically promote the development of the mass movement and promote social progress. People know that the arrival of the Great Leap Forward mass movement in 1958 was due to the great victories achieved by our country's socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, and due to the great mobilization and organizational role played by the Party's General Line, which highly promoted the socialist enthusiasm and revolutionary drive of the people; and the emergence of the people's communization mass movement was an inevitable product of our country's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture.
    Those who adopt a right-leaning opportunist attitude towards the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization movement, their fundamental mistake also lies in their distrust of the wisdom and strength of the masses, and underestimating or even negating the significance and achievements of mass revolutionary creation. They do not understand that the liberated working people are not only direct participants in production practice and social practice, but also, under the socialist system, under the guidance of Marxism which scientifically reveals the laws of social development, have become conscious creators of social history; therefore, their wisdom, strength, and revolutionary drive are endless. This wisdom, strength, and revolutionary drive, due to the enlightenment and leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, due to the encouragement and organization of the General Line, will flow like rivers, and will be invincible like an army, doing earth-shaking things and creating unprecedented miracles. The Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune are the great creations of the combination of the strength and wisdom of our 650 million people and the laws of the development of things. People with right-leaning opportunist thoughts, because they do not believe in the Party and do not believe in the masses, cannot understand the soaring enthusiasm of the masses and the great miracles they have created, and assume various "reasons" to doubt and distort them. As a result, they stumbled in front of the truth.
    Another fundamental mistake of those who adopt a right-leaning opportunist attitude towards the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization movement is that they exaggerate the shortcomings of the masses and dampen their spirits. Marxists always believe that it is difficult to completely avoid some shortcomings and mistakes in mass movements. This is because the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune are unprecedented new things, and the masses do not learn before doing these new things, but learn while doing them, so experience is insufficient; at the same time, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, mass movements "are not like inviting people to dinner, or writing articles, or painting and embroidering, they cannot be so elegant, so leisurely and unhurried, so refined and gentle," but are earth-shaking and rapidly advancing. Therefore, it is not surprising that some shortcomings and mistakes occur. Moreover, shortcomings and mistakes are always secondary and second in importance compared with achievements. Revolutionaries must never restrict the hands and feet of the masses because the masses have made some shortcomings and mistakes in the movement, but should let the masses improve their skills in their own struggles; they should not exaggerate the shortcomings and mistakes of the masses, criticize them, pour cold water on them, and blow cold air on them, but should, on the premise of fully believing in and encouraging the creative ability and revolutionary drive of the masses, summarize and concentrate the experience of the masses, absorb all the good things in the struggles of the masses, abandon the bad things, point out clear directions to the masses, help them learn new lessons from their shortcomings and mistakes, learn new skills, master new laws, and guide the masses to advance along the track of historical development.

### 满腔热情地对待群众运动

    满腔热情地对待群众运动
    革命必须广大群众行动起来。群众运动就是革命运动。一个人对待群众运动的态度怎样，是鉴别革命立场是否坚定，观点和方法是否正确的试金石。
    我们对于群众的革命运动不是惊慌失措，也不是指责非难，而是满腔热情地迎接它，支持它，用主动的积极的高兴的欢迎的全力以赴的精神领导它，使群众运动获得胜利或者沿着正确的道路前进。这就是我们无产阶级革命者对待群众运动的马克思主义的态度。
    对待群众运动还有另一种态度，这就是右倾机会主义的态度。抱这种态度的人，由于他们不能喜群众之所喜，好群众之所好，和群众同呼吸、共命运，看不见群众运动的成就，只看到并且夸大群众运动的某些缺点，因而在群众轰轰烈烈的斗争运动面前，总是始而大惊小怪，继而评头品足；每当群众运动前进一步，他们总是后退一步，终于被群众运动的洪流淹没。这已经是一条被历史事实证明了的规律。目前一些人把我国的大跃进运动和人民公社化运动诬蔑为“小资产阶级的狂热性运动”的错误论调，就是对待群众运动的右倾机会主义思想在新形势下的集中表现。
    对于大跃进和人民公社化的群众运动采取右倾机会主义态度的人，他们的根本错误，在于他们不尊重群众的实践，否认群众运动的正确性和必然性，企图把群众拉向后退。马克思主义者所以把全部的同情和支持放在群众方面，决不是盲目地为群众辩护，而是因为每一次群众运动的出现都不是一种偶然的现象，而是一定时期政治经济形势发展的规律性的产物；革命者的任务，就是要看到这种必然性和正确性，并且积极热情地促进群众运动的发展，推动社会前进。人们知道，1958年大跃进的群众运动的到来，是由于我国社会主义革命在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上取得了伟大胜利，由于党的总路线发挥了巨大的动员和组织作用，从而高度发扬了人民群众的社会主义积极性和革命干劲的结果；而人民公社化的群众运动的出现，又是我国工农业大跃进的必然产物。
    对待大跃进和人民公社化的群众运动采取右倾机会主义态度的人，他们的根本错误，还在于不信任群众的智慧和力量，低估甚至否定群众革命创造的意义和成就。他们不了解，解放了的劳动人民，不仅是生产实践和社会实践的直接参加者，而且在社会主义制度下，在科学地揭示了社会发展规律的马克思主义的指导下，已经成为社会历史的自觉的创造者；因而他们的智慧、力量和革命干劲是无穷无尽的。这种智慧、力量和革命干劲，由于党和毛泽东同志的启发和领导，由于总路线的鼓舞和组织，就会像江河之水，滚滚长流，就会像千军万马，所向无敌，做出翻天覆地的事业，创造前无古人的奇迹。大跃进和人民公社，就是我国六亿五千万人民群众的力量和智慧与事物发展规律相结合的伟大创造。有右倾机会主义思想的人，由于不相信党，不相信群众，对于群众的冲天干劲和他们创造的伟大奇迹无法理解，假设种种“理由”加以怀疑和歪曲，结果，他们在真理面前栽了跟斗。
    对待大跃进和人民公社化的群众运动采取右倾机会主义态度的人，他们的另一个根本错误，是他们夸大群众的缺点，打击群众的锐气。马克思主义者始终认为，群众运动中产生一些缺点错误是难以完全避免的。这是因为大跃进和人民公社是史无前例的新事物，群众在这些新事物的面前，不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，因而经验是不足的；同时，像毛泽东同志说的，群众运动“不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬”，而是轰轰烈烈，急流猛进。所以，发生一些缺点错误并不奇怪。而且，缺点错误和成绩比起来，总是次要的，第二位的。革命者决不能因为群众在运动中发生一些缺点错误而束缚群众的手足，而应该让群众在自己的斗争行动中提高自己的本领；更不能夸大群众的缺点错误，指责非难，向群众泼冷水、吹冷风，而应该在充分相信和鼓励群众的创造能力和革命干劲的前提下，概括和集中群众的经验，吸取群众斗争中一切好的东西，舍弃不好的东西，向群众指出明确方向，帮助他们从缺点错误中吸取新的教训，学到新的本领，掌握新的规律，指导群众沿着历史发展规律的轨道前进。
