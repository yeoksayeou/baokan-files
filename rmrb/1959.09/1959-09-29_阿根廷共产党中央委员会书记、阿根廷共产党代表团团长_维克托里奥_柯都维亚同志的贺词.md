Comrades, Friends:

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Argentina, the delegation attending this congress, and all Argentinians who love democracy and peace, to extend fraternal greetings and warm congratulations to the heroic Chinese people on the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

    Please allow me to first salute and congratulate the glorious fraternal Communist Party of China and the Marxist-Leninist Central Committee headed by the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong! Its wise policies first made it possible for the Chinese people to achieve victory over enemies at home and abroad, and now make the construction of a socialist society possible in your country.

    Indeed, during these ten years, as the historic Eighth Plenary Session has shown, the Chinese people have made great progress in the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The people of all nationalities of the great People's Republic of China have ample reason to be proud of the historic achievements their country has realized through the Great Leap Forward. There is no doubt that after completing the magnificent targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they will achieve even more astonishing achievements.

    Equally undoubtedly, the extraordinary progress made by the great People's Republic of China is due not only to the heroic spirit of your people, but also to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, which, with its organizational ability and creative spirit, has made it possible for the people to realize miracles.

    By consistently applying Marxism-Leninism to the special and inherent conditions of your country, you have established the people's commune as a form of promoting rural development and, more broadly, as a form of socialist construction.

    The great achievements of your country have won the support, warm concern, and love of the working masses and peoples of the world, who demand that their governments establish trade, cultural, and diplomatic relations with your great country, but this has aroused the deep hatred of the reactionaries and imperialists. Therefore, they have tried every means to obstruct the path to establishing the aforementioned relations. This is what has happened in Argentina. There, due to the intervention of U.S. imperialism, our government has not yet established formal diplomatic relations with your country and still maintains diplomatic relations with the Taiwan puppets, who, as Comrade Khrushchev has rightly said, are a bunch of zombies that should have been buried long ago.

    But this policy generally adopted by the governments of various Latin American countries has not and cannot prevent the growing support and love of our people for your people. This is especially true in Argentina. Here, not only communists but all those who fight for peace and national independence demand the establishment of diplomatic relations with your country, and at the same time, they carefully study China's experience in order to apply its valuable lessons to our country's unique circumstances.

    This is not accidental. Latin America is no longer in the position that U.S. imperialism originally hoped it would be: its quiet and reliable rear. At present, the people of Latin American countries have taken action through one path or another, and their struggle for freedom and national independence is constantly strengthening. The most shining example is that the heroic Cuban people have overthrown the bloody dictatorship of Batista by revolutionary means and resolutely embarked on the path of progress and democracy, thereby inspiring the liberation struggles of other Latin American countries.

    Naturally, U.S. and British imperialism and domestic reactionaries are attempting to prevent the path of liberation opened up by Cuba from extending to other Latin American countries.

    However, "Cut off the bloody claws of U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba" has become the slogan of the peoples of various Latin American countries, and around it, the peoples of various countries are mobilizing to support the Cuban people.

    However, it must be pointed out that while the forces of democracy, national independence, and peace are advancing, in various countries, the lackeys of imperialism and reactionary forces are intensifying their suppression activities. This is also the case in Argentina at present. Here, a year and a half ago, the alliance of workers and democratic forces won a victory in the elections on the basis of a program that included the basic points of anti-imperialism and land revolution, which the uncompromising Radical Civic Union party guaranteed to defend in the government. However, the Frondizi government not only failed to implement this program supported by the masses but betrayed it and finally completely surrendered to U.S. imperialism, the landlord oligarchy, and the reactionary elements in the military. The result is that under the mask of false democracy, a dictatorship supported by these reactionary militarists exists in our country.

    The working class, peasant masses, and the general population have waged and are waging heroic struggles to prevent the offensive of domestic reactionaries and the pressure of imperialism. In these struggles, they have striven and are striving to achieve the unity of workers and the people in order to establish a broad democratic coalition government that can satisfy the legitimate demands of the working class and the people and realize the program of anti-imperialist and land revolution.

    The rapid penetration of U.S. imperialism into Argentina means the intensification of reactionary activities in the economic, political, and socio-cultural aspects. However, every reactionary measure taken by the capitalists and the state, as well as every intervention by U.S. monopoly capital, is met with resistance from the working class and the people in the form of partial and general strikes, demonstrations, and other forms of protest and struggle. This year, millions of workers have participated in industry-wide and general strikes.

    However, until recently, not all strikes and mass movements have ended in victory. This is due to the lack of unity of the working class and its detachment from the peasant masses and other progressive strata of society. However, thanks to the Communists' insistence on a policy of unity, this period has gradually become a thing of the past. Not long ago, an agreement on trade union unity and a coordination committee for national and various scales of struggles were established, and this committee leads the vast majority of the Argentine working class in trade union activities.

    The current struggles, especially the general strike on the 23rd and 24th of this month in which four million industrial and agricultural workers participated, are unfolding under the banner of common action: Communists, Peronists, the left wing of the Socialist Party, Radicals, and non-partisans are fighting side by side not only to win their current common social and economic rights, but also to win profound changes in Argentina's economic and political situation.

    In this way, conditions are constantly being created to enable the proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party, to play its guiding and leading role in the alliance of democratic and national forces, thereby ensuring the victory of the anti-imperialist agrarian revolution.

    The events taking place in Argentina, to varying degrees, reflect the common characteristics of the peoples of various Latin American countries. This is: the current struggles, in addition to defending the social and economic rights of the working people, also reflect the objective need to ensure national independence and genuine democracy, to achieve revolutionary reforms of the outdated and backward economic structure, and to fundamentally change the political superstructure. Therefore, we Argentine Communists are convinced that, despite the reactionary measures and conspiracies of the current government, the current situation in our country will lead to the complete unity of the working class, the strengthening of the connection between the working class and the peasant masses, the establishment of a national democratic front, and finally to a broad democratic coalition government.

    The guarantee of all this is: the continuous growth of our Communist Party, the expansion of its organization and influence, and the fact that the working masses increasingly regard it as their pathfinder and leader.

    The victory of the struggle for democracy and freedom is becoming increasingly solid. Due to the consistent peace policy of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the countries of the socialist camp, the forces of reaction and war have had to retreat internationally and domestically. In the process of easing international tensions, the peoples of various countries fighting for freedom and independence, like the Argentine people, will be able to see more clearly that the peace policy of the socialist countries will become a generous and selfless aid to them in building an independent life; and they will also be able to see more clearly that the so-called "aid" of the imperialists is only an intensification of the exploitation of the peoples of underdeveloped countries. All this will accelerate the process of their national and social liberation.

    Undoubtedly, the tremendous achievements of the socialist camp, including the greatest feat in history, the launch of rockets to the moon by Soviet scientists and technicians (an event that has shaken the world), have even made the most stubborn anti-communists have to think deeply about the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. It is precisely this superiority in serving peace that has defeated the "Cold War," and this is gradually being understood by the people of the world and honest people in various countries.

    Now that the "Cold War" has begun to thaw, we Communists and all peace-loving people should wage an even more tenacious struggle than in the past to contribute to the elimination of the "Cold War." The ice of the "Cold War" must be melted in the warm currents of peace and coexistence. In this regard, Comrade Khrushchev put forward a program for fighting for world disarmament and for partial measures leading to world disarmament in his speech at the United Nations.

    We Argentine Communists regard this program of struggle as our own program, and in order to realize this program, we will launch a struggle in our country. We believe that this will be the best tribute we can pay to the tenth anniversary of the glorious victory of the Chinese revolution.

    Long live the tenth anniversary of the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the heroic Communist Party of China and its wise Marxist-Leninist leadership headed by the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong!

    Long live the fraternal unity between the Communist Party of Argentina and the Communist Party of China!

    Long live the friendship between the Argentine and Chinese peoples!

    Long live the glorious Soviet Union, the standard-bearer of world peace and the socialist camp!

    Long live peace!

### 阿根廷共产党中央委员会书记、阿根廷共产党代表团团长  维克托里奥·柯都维亚同志的贺词

专栏：

    阿根廷共产党中央委员会书记、阿根廷共产党代表团团长
    维克托里奥·柯都维亚同志的贺词同志们，朋友们：
    请允许我代表阿根廷共产党中央委员会，代表出席这次大会的代表团以及所有爱好民主和和平的阿根廷人，在伟大的中华人民共和国光荣的建国十周年之际，向英勇的中国人民致以兄弟般的敬礼和热烈的祝贺。
    请允许我首先向光荣的兄弟的中国共产党和以亲爱的毛泽东同志为首的马克思列宁主义的中央委员会致敬和祝贺！它英明的政策首先是使中国人民取得对于国内外敌人的胜利成为可能，而目前又使社会主义社会在你们国家的建成成为可能。
    的确，在这十年期间，正像历史性的八中全会所表明的那样，中国人民在社会主义建设的大跃进中取得了巨大的进步。伟大的中华人民共和国的各族人民有充分的理由为他们国家由于大跃进而实现的历史性的成就而感到骄傲。毫无疑问，在提前完成第二个五年计划的宏伟指标之后，他们将取得更加惊人的成就。
    同样无疑的，伟大的中华人民共和国所取得的非凡的进步，不仅归功于你们人民的英勇气概，而且归功于中国共产党的英明领导，它以其组织能力和创造精神使人民有可能实现奇迹。
    由于把马克思列宁主义一贯地应用于你们国家的特殊的和固有的条件，你们建立了作为促进农村发展的形式，而且更广泛地作为社会主义建设的形式的人民公社。
    你们国家的伟大成就争得了全世界的劳动群众和各国人民的支持，热烈的关怀和爱戴，他们要求本国政府同你们伟大的国家建立贸易、文化和外交关系，但是这却激起了反动派和帝国主义的刻骨的仇恨。因此，他们千方百计企图阻挠通向建立上述关系的道路。这也就是阿根廷所发生的情况。在那里，由于美帝国主义从中干涉，我国政府至今还没有和你们的国家建立正式的外交关系，并且仍然保持和台湾傀儡的外交关系，赫鲁晓夫同志说得好，这些傀儡是一群早应埋葬的僵尸。
    但是各拉丁美洲国家政府普遍采取的这种政策，并没有而且也不可能阻止我们的人民对于你们的人民的日益增长的支持和爱戴。这是阿根廷的特殊情况。在这里，不仅共产党人而且所有为和平和民族独立而斗争的人们都要求和你们国家建交，同时，他们认真地学习中国的经验，以便把它宝贵的教益应用到我国特有的情况。
    这并不是偶然的。拉丁美洲已经不再处于美帝国主义原来希望它所处的地位：它的安静而可靠的后方。目前，拉丁美洲各国人民已经通过这种或那种道路行动起来，他们争取自由和民族独立的斗争在不断加强。最光辉的例子就是英勇的古巴人民用革命的手段推翻了巴蒂斯塔的血腥独裁并坚决地走上了进步和民主的道路，从而鼓舞了拉丁美洲其他国家的解放斗争。
    很自然，美英帝国主义及国内反动派企图阻止古巴所开辟的解放道路扩展到其他拉丁美洲各国。
    但是，“斩断美帝国主义干涉古巴的血腥魔爪”已经成为拉丁美洲各国人民的口号，在它的周围，各国人民正为声援古巴人民而动员起来。
    但是，必须指出，在民主、民族独立和和平的力量前进的同时，在各个国家里，帝国主义的走狗、反动力量正加紧镇压活动。这也是目前阿根廷发生的情况。在这里，一年半以前工人和民主力量的联盟在一个包括反帝和土地革命的基本点的纲领的基础上在选举中取得了胜利，这个纲领是不妥协的激进人民联盟党保证在政府中加以捍卫的。但是弗朗迪西政府不仅没有贯彻执行这一受到群众支持的纲领，反而背弃了它，而终于完全向美帝国主义、地主寡头和军队中的反动分子投降。其结果就是在假民主的面具下在我国存在一种为这些反动军人所支持的独裁政权。
    工人阶级、农民群众和一般人民为阻止国内反动派的进攻和帝国主义的压力曾经进行了并且正在进行着英勇的斗争，他们在斗争中曾经努力并且正在努力获致工人和人民的团结，以求建立能满足工人阶级和人民的正当要求，实现反帝和土地革命纲领的广泛的民主联合政府。
    美帝国主义迅速地渗入阿根廷，意味着反动活动在经济、政治以及社会文化各方面的加紧。但是资本家和国家的每一个反动措施以及美国垄断资本的每一个干涉，都遭到工人阶级和人民局部罢工和总罢工、示威游行和其他抗议和斗争形式的反击。今年就有数百万劳动者参加了全行业的罢工和总罢工。
    但是直到最近为止，并不是所有的罢工和群众运动都以胜利告终。这是由于工人阶级缺乏团结，并且脱离了农民群众和社会上其他进步阶层。但是由于共产党人坚持团结政策，这一时期已渐成过去。不久以前成立了一项工会团结的协议以及一个全国性和各种规模的斗争的协调委员会，而由这委员会领导绝大多数的阿根廷工人阶级进行工会活动。
    目前的斗争，特别是本月23日和24日四百万产业工人和农业工人参加的总罢工，在共同行动的旗帜下展开：共产党人、庇隆分子、社会党左翼、激进党人和无党派人士不仅为争取他们目前共同的社会和经济的权利，而且也为争取阿根廷的经济和政治情况深刻的改变而并肩斗争。
    这样，正在不断创造条件，使无产阶级和它的先锋队——共产党，能够在民主和民族力量的联盟中发挥它的指导和领导作用，从而保证反帝的农业革命的胜利。
    在阿根廷发生的事件，在不同程度上表示出拉丁美洲各国人民所共有的特点。这就是：目前的斗争，除了保卫劳动人民的社会和经济的权利以外，还反映出，为了保证民族独立和真正的民主，获致对陈旧、落后的经济结构的革命性的改革，和基本上改变政治上层建筑的客观需要。因此，我们阿根廷共产党人确信，尽管现政府的反动措施和阴谋诡计，我国目前的形势将导致工人阶级完全的团结，工人阶级与农民群众联系的加强，民族民主阵线的成立，最后将导致一广泛的民主联合政府。
    这一切的保证是：我们共产党不断的壮大，它的组织和影响的扩大以及劳动群众日益把它当作自己的带路人和领导者的事实。
    争取民主和自由的斗争的胜利已日益稳固。由于苏联、中华人民共和国以及社会主义阵营各国一贯的和平政策，反动和战争势力不得不在国际和国内实行退却。国际紧张局势趋向缓和的过程中，争取自由和独立的各国人民，如同阿根廷人民，将能更清楚地看到社会主义国家的和平政策将成为他们建设独立生活的慷慨和无私的援助；并且也能更清楚地看到帝国主义者的所谓“援助”只是对不发达国家人民进行变本加厉的剥削。这一切将加速他们民族社会解放的过程。
    毫无疑问，社会主义阵营巨大的成就，其中包括历史上最伟大的壮举，苏联科学家和技术人员向月球发射的火箭（这一事件本身已震撼全世界），甚至使那些最顽固不化的反共分子对社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越这一点也不得不深思一番。就是这为和平服务的优越性挫败了“冷战”，这一点正逐渐为全世界人民和各国正直的人们所了解。
    现在“冷战”已开始解冻，我们共产党人和一切爱好和平的人们正应该进行比过去更顽强的斗争，为消灭“冷战”作出贡献。必须使得“冷战”的冰块融化在和平和共处的热流中。在这方面，赫鲁晓夫同志在他在联合国的发言中提出了争取世界裁军和争取导向世界裁军的部分措施而斗争的纲领。
    我们阿根廷共产党人把这斗争纲领当作自己的纲领，并且为了实现这个纲领，我们将在我们国内展开斗争。我们相信，这将是我们对光荣的中国革命胜利十周年纪念所表示的最好的敬意。
    中华人民共和国十周年纪念万岁！
    英勇的中国共产党和它的以亲爱的毛泽东同志为首的英明的马克思列宁主义的领导万岁！
    阿根廷共产党和中国共产党之间的兄弟般的团结万岁！
    阿中人民之间的友谊万岁！
    世界和平和社会主义阵营的旗手，光荣的苏联万岁！
    和平万岁！（附图片）
