Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 24th: Hunan has achieved a bumper harvest of mid-season rice in a year of severe drought. Currently, the province's more than 17 million mu of mid-season rice has been basically harvested. The yield per unit area has increased by about 10% compared to last year's relatively large harvest. In Shaoyang and Qianyang prefectures, the main mid-season rice producing areas, the 5.3 million mu of mid-season rice that has already been harvested has yielded an average of over 500 jin of dry grain per mu.

This year's bumper harvest of mid-season rice in Hunan is the result of the broad masses of people's commune members, under the strong leadership of the Party, overcoming natural disasters such as drought and insect pests with a spirit of "man can conquer nature." During the fifty or so days from mid-June to early August, when the mid-season rice was budding and heading and in need of water, most parts of the province did not receive any rain. However, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and inspired by the call of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to launch a large-scale high-yield grain movement, the broad masses of farmers were full of vigor and high morale. They put forward the fighting slogan: "Fight the drought until heaven lowers its head, protect the seedlings until the grain enters the granary," and adopted methods such as finding springs in the mountains, digging wells in the plains, damming rivers, and building aqueducts to divert water, working day and night to draw water to fight the drought, protecting the seedlings and ensuring the harvest. During the intense days of drought resistance, the province mobilized up to more than five million people and more than one million water-lifting tools every day, turning rivers and seas upside down, diverting water up the mountains, and finally overcoming the drought, turning a year of disaster into a year of harvest.

In the fight against drought, the people's communes in various places carried out large-scale cooperation, demonstrating tremendous superiority. Seventeen people's communes and 327 production brigades in Ningxiang County mutually adjusted more than 7,000 water sources, expanding the irrigation area by more than 40,000 mu. At the same time, they used labor exchange to mutually adjust more than 10,000 laborers to draw water to fight the drought. In the tense struggle against drought, the people's communes also uniformly arranged for more than 50,000 people to carry out timely mid-cultivation, topdressing, and pest control in the mid-season rice fields; generally, they cultivated and weeded three or four times, applied dozens of dan of fertilizer per mu, and basically eliminated third-class seedlings. Field management work was better than in any previous year. Therefore, the county's more than 270,000 mu of mid-season rice increased by another 15% compared to last year's relatively large harvest.

Accompanying the drought, mid-season rice in many places suffered from several consecutive outbreaks of pests such as rice borers and leafhoppers. The people's communes in various places fully utilized the superiority of having a large population and strong momentum, and each time adopted unified action, comprehensive encirclement and suppression, fierce attacks, and quick battles to carry out large-scale pest control movements, quickly extinguishing the pests. Qu Lan People's Commune in Hengyang County, which was previously known as a "pest nest," launched eight 10,000-person pest control movements this year, eliminating the pests, and the commune's more than 30,000 mu of mid-season rice increased by 20% compared to last year.

Because the people's communes can uniformly allocate labor on a larger scale and cooperate with each other, they can not only quickly overcome natural disasters, but also ensure that the planting of mid-season rice seizes the season and implements the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions. Therefore, this year's mid-season rice has achieved bumper harvests everywhere, whether in plains, mountains, low-yield areas, or high-yield areas. Yangxi Commune in Xinhua County is a tea-producing area. In the past, the mid-season rice transplanting always coincided with the tea picking season, and labor was tight. Every year it was "transplanting the seedlings when the tea is old, picking the tea when the seedlings are yellow." This year, the people's commune adopted labor exchange and uniformly allocated labor and cattle throughout the commune, and this contradiction was resolved. The commune's more than 16,000 mu of mid-season rice was transplanted half a month earlier than last year, catching up with the season. In addition, with reasonable close planting, deep plowing, and layered fertilization, the average yield was 631 jin of dry grain per mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. Xianglin Commune in the poor mountainous area of Daoxian County adopted methods such as carrying river mud, mountain topsoil, and burning soil ash to improve more than 10,000 mu of low-yield fields, and newly built five reservoirs to solve the water shortage problem for more than 20,000 mu of fields. At the same time, combined with deep plowing, they applied more than 500 dan of fertilizer per mu. As a result, the commune's more than 39,000 mu of mid-season rice yielded an average of 534 jin per mu, an increase of 38% compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th: Guizhou Province has overcome the threat of continuous two-month severe drought and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of mid-season rice.

As of September 20, the province's more than 3.69 million mu of harvested mid-season rice has yielded an average of 698 jin per mu, not only not reducing production due to drought, but also slightly increasing compared to the exceptionally abundant harvest of 1958. The more than 920,000 mu of mid-season rice in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which has been inspected and accepted, has yielded an average of 909 jin per mu, an increase of about 30% compared to last year, and has completed the grain production target stipulated in the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule; among them, more than 75,900 mu of mid-season rice yielded more than 1,000 jin per mu, with the highest yield reaching 3,300 jin per mu. Bijie Prefecture, known as the plateau on the Guizhou Plateau, suffered from drought on 4 million mu of crops this year, but the more than 250,000 mu of harvested mid-season rice still yielded an average of 729 jin per mu. Luodian County, formerly known for "planting on a slope and harvesting in a pot," is a border county where the Buyi ethnic group in southern Guizhou lives. This year, it overcame the successive attacks of drought, insects, and other disasters. The 28,000 mu of harvested mid-season rice yielded an average of 700 jin per mu. Tongren Prefecture, the most severely drought-stricken area in Guizhou Province, suffered from drought on 60% of its area, but 85% of the 710,000 mu of harvested mid-season rice increased by 10-20% compared to last year or did not decrease in production.

In June and July this year, when the mid-season rice was in the elongation and booting stage, Guizhou Province was threatened by severe drought, with a drought-affected area of 6.9 million mu. Thanks to the timely organization of 4 million drought-fighting troops by more than 500 people's communes throughout the province, and the use of hundreds of thousands of water conservancy projects and various drought-fighting tools built after liberation, the drought-affected area was finally forced to shrink. Bijie Prefecture brought into play the role of more than 140,000 mountain ponds, reservoirs, and canals built in recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year and after communization, making 3.6 million mu of farmland immune to drought. The 800,000 drought-fighting troops organized by the communes in Tongren Prefecture launched a protracted struggle against the drought, rescuing most of the drought-affected crops.

Currently, while intensifying careful harvesting and threshing, farmers throughout the province are actively delivering and selling grain. As of September 20, the province's autumn grain storage has reached more than 1.19 billion jin, 24 times more than the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 24th: More than 80 million mu of autumn crops in Heilongjiang Province have matured and begun to be harvested. The broad masses of farmers throughout the province are using practical actions of carefully harvesting and threshing grain to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

In order to harvest the crops well, all parts of the province have actively launched the "Autumn Harvest Increase Production and Savings Movement." Under the slogan of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, the people's communes in Nehe County launched a vigorous autumn harvest production counterpart competition with the content of quick, good, and comprehensive autumn harvest work. During the stage of strengthening late-stage management of autumn fields, Shicao Commune in Acheng County has increased the planned yield per hectare from 4,500 jin to 5,000 jin. When formulating the autumn harvest action plan, it found 13 loopholes for losing grain, studied measures to plug them, and then increased the planned yield per hectare to 5,500 jin. Gonghe Commune in Hailun County divided the commune's labor force into three fronts: the first front was a strong labor force of about 5,000 people to carry out a surprise harvest; the second front was a general labor force and part of the female labor force, about 4,000 people to dig potatoes and rub corn; the third front was a grain picking team composed of the elderly and primary school students, contracting vehicles and land to thoroughly pick up the remaining grain in the fields and on the roads, ensuring the progress and quality of the autumn harvest.

During the autumn harvest, leaders at all levels went deep into the fields to strengthen guidance. The secretary and commissioner of the Songhua River Prefectural Committee took the lead, dividing areas and assigning responsibilities. Various cities and counties also organized autumn harvest inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots. At the provincial, county, commune, and team levels, field headquarters, command posts, or leading groups were established to guide autumn harvest work. In order to ensure that the labor army can eat well and have enough to eat during the autumn harvest, the people's communes in various places also actively tried to run canteens and nurseries well. A secretary or deputy director of the commune and management area is responsible for leading the work of public canteens and nurseries. (Attached picture)

    人民公社威力大　抗击灾害天低头
    湖南贵州双报中稻大面积丰收
    黑龙江掀起秋收增产节约运动精打细收粮食
    新华社长沙24日电　湖南大旱之年中稻大丰收。现在，全省一千七百多万亩中稻已经基本收割完毕。单位面积产量较大丰收的去年增产一成左右。中稻主要产区邵阳、黔阳两专区已经收打的五百三十多万亩中稻，平均每亩收干谷五百斤以上。
    今年湖南中稻大丰收，是广大人民公社社员，在党的坚强领导下，以人定胜天的精神，战胜干旱、虫害等自然灾害取得的。从6月中旬到8月上旬的五十来天中，正当中稻怀苞抽穗、需要水分的时候，全省大部分地区没有下雨。但是，广大农民在总路线的光辉照耀下，在中共湖南省委号召开展大面积粮食千斤丰产运动的鼓舞下，人人意气风发，个个斗志昂扬。他们提出：“抗旱抗到天低头，保苗保到谷进仓”的战斗口号，采取高山找泉、平地打井、拦河堵坝、架设渡槽引水等办法，日夜车水抗旱，保苗保收。在抗旱的紧张日子里，全省每天最多出动到五百多万人、一百多万件提水工具，翻江倒海，引水上山，终于战胜干旱，使灾年变成丰年。
    在抗旱中，各地人民公社开展大协作，显示了巨大的优越性。宁乡县十七个人民公社、三百二十七个生产大队，互相调整了七千多处水源，扩大灌溉面积四万多亩，同时用换工方式互相调剂了一万多个劳动力，车水抗旱。在紧张的抗旱斗争中，各人民公社还统一安排了五万多人，在中稻田里及时进行中耕、追肥、除虫等工作；一般中耕除草三、四次，每亩追肥几十担，基本上消灭了三类苗，田间管理工作比以往任何一年都做得好。因此全县二十七万多亩中稻较大丰收的去年又增产一成半。
    伴随着干旱而来的，许多地方中稻连续几次发生螟虫、浮尘子等虫害。各地人民公社充分发挥了人多势众的优越性，每次都采取统一行动、全面围剿、猛攻猛打、速战速决等办法，开展声势浩大的治虫运动，很快扑灭了虫害。过去被称为“虫窝子”的衡阳县曲兰人民公社，今年连续开展了八次万人治虫运动，消除了虫害，全社三万多亩中稻比去年增产两成。
    由于人民公社能在更大范围内统一调配劳动力，互相协作支援，不仅能很快地战胜自然灾害，而且保证中稻的种植抓住了季节和因地制宜地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，因此今年中稻不论平原、山地、低产区或高产区，处处丰收。新化县洋溪公社是个产茶区，过去每年中稻插秧正碰上采茶季节，劳力紧张，年年是“插得秧来茶又老，采得茶来秧又黄”，今年人民公社在全社范围内，采取换工方式，统一调配劳力、耕牛，这个矛盾就解决了。全社一万六千多亩中稻较去年提早半个月插完秧，赶上了季节，再加上合理密植、深耕、分层施肥等措施，平均每亩收干谷六百三十一斤，较去年增产两成多。贫瘠山区道县祥林公社，今年采取挑河泥、山皮土、烧火土灰等办法，改良低产田一万多亩，新修五座水库，解决了两万多亩田的缺水困难，同时结合深耕每亩施了五百多担肥料，结果，全社三万九千多亩中稻，平均亩产五百三十四斤，比去年增产38％。
    新华社贵阳24日电　贵州省各地战胜连续两个月的严重干旱威胁，夺得了中稻大面积丰收。
    到9月20日止，全省已收割的三百六十九万多亩中稻，平均亩产六百九十八斤，不仅没有因旱减产，而且比特大丰收的1958年还略有增加。黔东南苗族侗族自治州经过验收的九十二万多亩中稻，平均亩产九百零九斤，比去年约增产三成，提前完成了十二年农业发展纲要所规定的粮食生产指标；其中有七万五千九百亩中稻亩产千斤以上，最高亩产达到三千三百斤。号称贵州高原上的高原——毕节专区，今年虽有四百万亩作物受旱，但已收的二十五万多亩中稻平均亩产仍达七百二十九斤。过去以“种一坡、收一锅”著称的罗甸县，是贵州南部布依族聚居的边沿县分，今年战胜旱、虫等灾害的轮番袭击，已收的二万八千亩中稻，平均亩产七百斤。贵州省受旱最重的铜仁专区，受旱面积达60％，但已收割的七十一万亩中稻，85％左右都比去年增产一两成或者没有减产。
    贵州省今年6、7月份，正当中稻拔节、孕穗期间，受到严重干旱威胁，受旱面积达六百九十万亩。由于全省五百多个人民公社及时组织起四百万抗旱大军，利用解放后兴修的几十万处水利工程和各种抗旱工具，终于迫使受旱面积日益缩小。毕节专区发挥几年来、特别是去年大跃进以来和公社化后新建的十四万多处山塘、水库、沟渠的作用，使三百六十万亩田土免受干旱危害。铜仁专区各公社组成的八十万抗旱队伍，同干旱展开了持久斗争，使大部分受旱作物得到挽救。
    目前，全省农民在加紧细收细打的同时，积极交售粮食。到9月20日止，全省秋粮入库已达十一亿九千多万斤，比去年同期多二十四倍。
    新华社哈尔滨24日电　黑龙江省八千多万亩大秋作物已经成熟开始收割，全省广大农民用精收细打粮食的实际行动来迎接建国十周年。
    为了使庄稼收的好，全省各地积极开展了“秋收增产节约运动”。讷河县各人民公社在学先进、赶先进、超先进的口号下，以秋收工作要快、要好、要全面为内容，掀起了轰轰烈烈的秋收生产对口赛。阿城县石槽公社在加强秋田后期管理阶段，已将计划每公顷产量由四千五百斤提高到五千斤，制订秋收行动计划时，找出损失粮食的十三个漏洞，研究了堵塞的措施后，每公顷又增订为五千五百斤。海伦县共合公社将全社劳动力划分为三个战线，第一线是强壮劳力，约五千人突击收割；第二线是一般劳力和部分妇女劳力，约四千人起土豆和搓苞米；第三线是老年与小学生组成的拣粮队，包车包地，彻底拣净地里和道上的遗粮，保证了秋收进度和质量。
    在秋收中各级领导深入田间，加强了指导。松花江地委的书记和专员挂帅，分片包干。各市县也分别组织了秋收检查团，深入基层。全省各县、社、区、队四级分别成立了田间指挥部、指挥所或领导小组，指导秋收工作。为了保证劳动大军在秋收中吃的饱吃的好，各地人民公社还积极设法办好食堂和托儿所，公社、管理区都有一名书记或副主任负责领导公共食堂和托儿所工作。（附图片）
