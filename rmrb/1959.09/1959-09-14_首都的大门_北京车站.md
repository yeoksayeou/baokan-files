    The Capital's Gateway—Beijing Railway Station
    By our correspondent Zhou Dingfang
    The capital's gateway – Beijing Railway Station – is basically completed.
    This station is currently the largest passenger station in our country. It is located between Chongwenmen and Dongbianmen, only three kilometers from the city center, and close to the Qianmen Station built more than fifty-three years ago. With the development of socialist construction, the old Qianmen Station has become increasingly unable to meet the needs. After the new station opens, trains will no longer pass through the city center, and urban traffic will not be blocked as a result.
    For the facade of the station building, the architects adopted a combination of new structures and national forms, using advanced round arch "thin shell" structures in the central part of the building, flanked by two clock towers as high as forty-three meters. The east and west wings of the building are two corner towers with glazed tile roofs. Nearly three-quarters of this 218-meter-long building is made of large glass windows, surrounded by beige-colored face bricks, making the building appear magnificent and simple.
    Chen Deng'ao, the chief designer, briefly introduced the scale of the station to us. He said that the station was designed according to long-term plans and built in one go. The main project constituting this station is eight times larger than the building of Beijing Qianmen Station. In front of the building is a square that can accommodate 50,000 people, and behind it is an elevated overpass for passengers to enter the station. Three underpasses, six platforms, and twelve railway tracks cover a construction area of more than 80,000 square meters. A large open space is left behind the railway tracks, which can be expanded to include three platforms and six railway tracks when passenger traffic further increases. At that time, the station's equipment capacity will be fully utilized, and it will be able to handle about 200 pairs of trains and 200,000 passengers per day.
    On the construction drawings, we saw that the station project was very large. The amount of earthwork alone reached more than 900,000 cubic meters. If these were built into earth walls one meter high and one meter wide, the length would reach 900 kilometers. The total length of underground cables, gas, and communication pipes reaches 410 kilometers. Under normal circumstances, the construction of this project would require one year for design and two years for construction. However, under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the 8,000 builders of the station spent only ten months from the start of design to the completion of the project, and the quality of the project met the design requirements. Therefore, the workers proudly call this building a product of the Great Leap Forward.
    Walking through the entrance, we came to the central hall. This is the central hub leading to the various waiting rooms. Its height is equivalent to a ten-story building. The layout of the central hall up, down, left, and right embodies the design concept of providing convenience to passengers. On both sides of the entrance, there are two television information desks. There are no attendants at the information desks. As soon as a passenger steps onto the information counter, the power door opens automatically. At this time, the imaging camera and broadcaster installed opposite the information desk broadcast the passenger's appearance and questions to the television room more than 80 meters away. In a matter of seconds, the passenger can hear the attendant's reply. This station has a total of nine information desks, and passengers can easily inquire about all matters related to their train journey whether they are in the restaurant or in the waiting hall. In the middle of the hall, four escalators are being installed. The width of the escalator can accommodate two people standing side by side. It is like a belt conveyor, quickly transporting passengers from the first floor to the second floor, and can transport 24,000 passengers per hour. On both sides of the escalator, there are four elevators and two staircases, making it very convenient for passengers to go up and down. On the east and west sides of the hall are service facilities such as post and telecommunications, bookstores, small shops, and local specialty products. Two large clocks are installed on each of the two towers above the hall, and the hour hand of the clock is more than one person long. Every fifteen minutes, a melodious chime sounds. These two large clocks and the 214 electric clocks in the station are all driven by a "master clock," which ensures that the time throughout the station is accurate to the second. Passengers can buy tickets in the spacious ticket hall, which has more than twenty open ticket offices and forty-eight telephones to facilitate passengers' ticket reservations.
    The east side of the central hall is the spacious and bright waiting hall. Its pillars and floors are beige, and the walls on both sides are inlaid with square glass bricks. The hall is furnished with soft leather seats, and the walls are decorated with various oil paintings and traditional Chinese paintings. Passengers will feel peaceful and comfortable sitting here to rest. Chen Deng'ao told us that Beijing Railway Station has a total of eighteen waiting halls (rooms) of different sizes, which can accommodate 14,000 passengers at the same time. This waiting hall is nine times larger than Qianmen Station. These waiting halls are well-lit, have soft tones, and are simply decorated, but each has its own unique style. Some have ceilings made of glass bricks, and some are arched. Each waiting hall has drinking water, washing facilities, and toilets nearby. The three mother-and-child waiting rooms have floors and walls made of hardwood. The rooms are furnished with more than seventy small beds for babies to sleep on, and a wooden toy cabinet in the center, shaped like a large vase, contains various toys. On the walls around the room, there are gold-leaf paintings of children playing various games.
    Coming out of the waiting hall and turning north, is the first platform specially set up to welcome distinguished guests. This platform is particularly wide and long compared to the other five platforms, with a sky-blue canopy and lake-green pillars. It is equipped with film photography, live broadcasting, and other equipment. There are also several exquisite VIP lounges at the entrance of the platform. In front of the station is a square that can accommodate 50,000 people to welcome distinguished guests. All of this demonstrates the Chinese people's friendship towards international friends.
    The phenomenon of congestion caused by passengers coming and going is common in general stations. Here, the routes of suburban passengers and long-distance passengers, boarding passengers and disembarking passengers, and people and luggage are all separated. Suburban passengers have separate entrances and exits. Long-distance passengers reach the various platforms through elevated overpasses; disembarking passengers reach the exit hall through a nine-meter-wide and 130-meter-long underpass. Luggage is sent to the various platforms through the underpass. This avoids congestion.
    We stepped up the stairs to visit. A huge map of the national railway lines hangs in the center of the second floor. The lines on the map, like spider webs, are centered on Beijing, running across the country in all directions. On the west side of the second floor is a restaurant for external business that can accommodate 700 people dining at the same time. On the mezzanine of the third floor, there is a news cinema, television room, and club that can accommodate 300 people. If passengers arrive at the station and have time before their train departs, they can take a few minutes to watch a newsreel or enjoy television; they can also participate in various cultural and recreational activities in the club according to their interests. Here, passengers will feel more interesting and convenient than at their own homes.
    On the third floor, modern "track circuit centralized equipment" is also installed, which brings great convenience to the station staff. This equipment can concentrate all the station's turnouts and signal lights on one console. The signalman only needs to sit next to the console and easily press the button, and he can open a train's route in about ten seconds, which is more than five times more efficient than using manual or semi-mechanized point switches in the past, and can ensure absolute safety. Ultra-shortwave radio is also used to direct shunting operations on site. The broadcasting room, known as the "mouth" and "eyes" of the station, uses advanced broadcasting equipment. The announcer sits in the broadcasting room and can see the situation of passengers in the waiting hall through the television. When the announcer needs to tell passengers the departure time of each train, he only needs to press the button, and the tape recorder installed on the upper floor of the broadcasting room will automatically broadcast the departure time and the precautions that passengers should take.
    After visiting the various new types of equipment in the station, people will happily feel that the new Beijing Railway Station reflects the face of the rapid development of China's industry, and it is a product equipped with new technologies and equipment from our country.

    首都的大门——北京车站
    本报记者　周定舫
    首都的大门——北京车站基本建成了。
    这个车站是我国目前规模最大的客运车站，位置在崇文门和东便门中间，离市中心只有三公里，靠近五十三年以前修建的前门车站。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，古老的前门车站已经越来越不能满足需要了。新车站通车后，火车不再驶过市区，市内交通将不会因此而受到阻塞。
    车站大楼的立面，建筑师采用了新型结构和民族形式相结合的手法，在建筑物的中央部分用先进的圆拱“薄壳”结构，两旁配以两个高达四十三米的钟塔。大楼的东、西两翼，是两座琉璃瓦顶的角楼。这个有二百一十八米长的大楼，近四分之三都是大玻璃窗，周围配上米黄色的面砖，使大楼的体型显得气魄雄伟而又朴素大方。
    设计总负责人陈登鳌，概括地向我们介绍了车站的规模。他说，这个车站是按照远期规划进行设计，一次建成的。构成这个车站的主要工程，比北京前门车站的大楼大八倍。大楼的前面是一个能容纳五万人集会的广场，后面是旅客入站的高架天桥。三条地道、六个月台和十二条铁路股道，建筑面积共达八万多平方米。铁路股道的后面还留出一大片空地，在客运量进一步增长时，可以扩建三个月台和六条铁路股道线。到那时，车站的设备能力将完全发挥出来，每天能接发列车二百对左右，接送二十万旅客。
    在施工图上，我们看到这个车站的工程十分浩大。仅以土方量计算，就达到九十多万土方。如果把这些土建成高宽各一米的土墙，长度达九百公里。铺在地下的电缆、煤气和通讯管道的总长度，共达四百一十公里。在通常情况下，建设这项工程需要设计一年，施工两年。但车站的八千名建设者，在党的社会主义的总路线照耀下，从设计开始到工程建成，总共只用了十个月时间，工程质量达到设计要求。因此，工人们自豪地称这座建筑物是大跃进的产物。
    走过门廊，我们来到中央大厅。这是通往各个候车室的总枢纽。它的高度相当于一座十层楼房。中央大厅上下左右的设置，处处体现了给旅客方便的设计思想。在入口处的两侧，设有两个电视问讯处。在问讯处看不到服务员，只要旅客踏上问讯台，电门就自动开了。这时，装在问讯处对面的射像机和广播器，就把旅客的面貌和问话，播送到八十多米远的电视室里。几秒钟功夫，旅客就能听到服务员的答复。这个车站，共设置了九个问讯处，旅客们无论在餐厅或是在候车厅里，都能很方便地问询有关乘车的一切事项。大厅中间，正在安装四部自动扶梯，自动扶梯的宽度，能并排站两个人。它好像皮带运输机一样，迅速地把旅客从一层楼送到二层楼，每小时能运送二万四千个旅客。自动扶梯两旁，还有四部电梯和两处楼梯，旅客上下很方便。大厅的东、西两面，是邮电、书店、小卖部和土特产商品等服务场所。大厅上面的两座塔楼，还各安装着一座大钟，钟的时针有一人多长。每一刻钟，就发出一次节奏悦耳的钟声。这两座大钟和车站内的二百一十四个电钟，都是由一个“母钟”带动的，能使全站的时刻分秒不差。旅客们购买车票，可以到面积宽敞的售票厅去，这里设有二十多个敞开式的售票处，有四十八部电话便于旅客预订车票。
    中央大厅的东面是宽敞明朗的候车厅。它的柱子和地面都是米色的，两面的墙壁是用方格玻璃砖镶贴而成。厅内布置有柔软的皮坐椅，墙上挂着各种油画和国画，旅客们坐在这里休息，将感到宁静和舒适。陈登鳌告诉我们，北京车站共有十八个大小不同的候车厅（室），能同时容纳一万四千个旅客。这个候车厅比前门车站大九倍。这些候车厅光线充足，色调柔和，装饰朴素，但都别具风格。有的是用玻璃砖拼成的顶篷，有的是圆拱形的。每个候车厅附近，都有饮水、洗手和厕所等设备。三个母子候车室，它的地面和墙壁都是用硬木铺成的。室内放着七十多张供婴孩睡眠的小床，中间设有一个木刻玩具柜，形状像一个大花瓶，里面放置各种玩具。墙壁四周，画着儿童们在做各种游戏的沥粉贴金彩画。
    从候车厅出来，往北一拐，便是专设的欢迎贵宾的第一月台。这个月台比其他五个月台显得特别宽长，顶篷是天蓝色的，柱子是湖绿色的。这里设有电影摄影、实况播音等设备。月台入口处，还设有几个讲究的贵宾休息室。车站前面有一个能容五万群众迎接贵宾的广场。这一切都表明了中国人民对国际友人的友谊。
    旅客们往来而发生的拥挤现象，在一般车站是常见的。这里，近郊旅客和长途旅客、上车旅客和下车旅客、人和行李的线路都是分开的。近郊旅客有单独的出入道。长途旅客上车，通过高架天桥到达各个站台；下车通过一条九米宽、一百三十米长的地道到出口大厅。行李是从地道送到各个站台的。这样，就避免了拥挤现象。
    我们踏着楼道往上参观。二楼正中悬挂着一幅巨大的全国铁路线路图，图上的线路像蛛网一般，以北京为中心，横贯全国，四通八达。二楼西面，是一个能容七百人同时进餐的对外营业餐厅。三楼夹层，设有能容三百人的新闻影院、电视室和俱乐部。旅客们到了车站，如果离开车时间还早的话，可以利用十几分钟去看看新闻电影，或是欣赏电视；也可以根据自己的兴趣，到俱乐部里去进行各种文化娱乐活动。在这里，旅客们将会感到比在自己家里还要有趣，还要方便。
    在三层楼上，还安装有现代化的“进路继电集中设备”，给车站的工作人员带来很大方便。这种设备能把全站的道岔和信号灯都集中在一个操纵台上。信号员只要坐在操纵台旁轻便地按动电钮，在十秒钟左右就能开通一条列车的进路，比过去用人力或半机械化扳道岔，效率提高了五倍以上，而且能保证绝对安全。这里还用超短波无线电指挥现场的调车作业。被称作车站的“嘴巴”和“眼睛”的播音室，都是采用先进的广播设备。播音员坐在播音室里，通过电视机就能看到候车厅内旅客的情况。当播音员需要告诉旅客每趟列车开车的时刻时，只要按动电钮，装在播音室楼上的录音带就自动地将开车时刻和旅客应注意事项播送出去。
    人们参观了车站里各种新型设备后，都会喜悦地感到，新的北京车站反映了我国工业飞跃发展的面貌，它是用我国新技术设备装备起来的产物。
