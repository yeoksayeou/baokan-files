When the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached Zhangpu County, they immediately sparked a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy among the more than 2,700 cadres and workers in the county's government offices. All units have formulated specific plans, determined to respond to the Party Central Committee's call to battle. Currently, more than 25% of cadres in Zhangpu County's government offices have gone deep into the grassroots, directly participating in central campaigns. Those comrades who remain at their posts have expressed their determination to do everything possible to improve work efficiency, to be as effective as two people. They are also determined to vigorously engage in production during their spare time, to achieve the plan of increasing grain production by 300,000 jin, raising 4,000 pigs, and achieving a total output value of one million yuan, including cash savings, in the second half of the year.

As early as before the high tide of summer harvesting and planting in the countryside, the broad masses of cadres in government offices in Zhangpu County joined the county's farmers in actively engaging in the movement to increase production and practice economy. The employees of the Construction Company cultivated ten mu of sweet potatoes on their own, averaging more than 600 jin of staple food per person. The Grain Bureau planted nearly five mu of vegetables, and the harvested vegetables not only meet their own needs but also supply more than 500 jin to the market. They raised sixty pigs (an average of one and a half pigs per person), and the feed was all grown by themselves. Doctors and nurses at Zhangpu Hospital also raised a large number of pigs. The pork and pork liver eaten by the patients are sometimes the result of their production. In the past month, thanks to the joint efforts of the broad masses of cadres and workers throughout the county, remarkable achievements have been made in increasing production: a total of 1,090 mu of vegetables and other grain crops have been planted, and it is estimated that by the end of the year, more than 300,000 jin of grain and more than 380,000 jin of vegetables can be harvested, ensuring that the county's government offices have more than enough vegetables for their own consumption (currently, 30% of the units are self-sufficient in vegetables). 3,237 pigs have been raised, and half of them are already available for market supply. 50% of the county's government offices have achieved self-sufficiency in pork.

In terms of practicing strict economy, in the past month or so, cadres and workers have increased their savings by more than 26,000 yuan. Various departments have cleared inventories of overstocked materials worth more than 80,000 yuan, construction costs have been reduced by 280,000 yuan, and office expenses have been reduced by 40,000 yuan based on the principle of "resolutely not buying what can be bought or not bought."

The Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session further encouraged the cadres and workers in government offices throughout the county, and everyone is full of confidence in achieving their plans. On August 28, more than 40 cadres from the County Party Committee, the Hospital, the People's Committee, and other departments went to the fields before dawn to fertilize and weed sweet potatoes, and at the same time plowed the land to plant vegetables. Everyone said: "To respond to the call of the Central Committee, we must carry forward the fine revolutionary tradition and take the lead in the movement to increase production and practice economy."

    机关干部要一人顶两人用
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议传到我们漳浦县时，立即在全县二千七百多名机关干部、职工当中，掀起新的增产节约高潮。各单位都具体制订了计划，决心响应党中央的战斗号召。目前，漳浦县机关有25％以上的干部深入基层，直接参加中心运动，在家同志都表示要千方百计提高工作效率，一人顶两人用。并决心在业余时间大搞生产，实现下半年增产粮食三十万斤、毛猪四千头，连节约现金在内，产值共达一百万元的计划。
    我们漳浦县机关广大干部，早在农村开展夏收夏种高潮以前，就同全县农民一道，积极投入增产节约运动。建筑公司职工自己动手开荒种地瓜十亩，平均每人可收主粮六百斤以上；粮食局种了近五亩蔬菜，收获的蔬菜不但可以自给，还供应市场五百多斤。他们养了六十头毛猪（每人平均一头半），饲料都是自己种的。漳浦医院的医生、护士也养了大批毛猪。病员们吃的猪肉、猪肝，有的就是他们生产的收获。一个月来，在全县广大干部、职工共同努力下，增产成绩十分优异：共计种菜和其他粮食作物一千零九十亩，估计在年底前可收粮食三十多万斤、蔬菜三十八万多斤，保证全县机关蔬菜自给有余（目前已有30％单位吃菜自给）。养猪三千二百三十七头，目前已有一半可以供应市场。全县有50％的机关已实现猪肉自给。
    在厉行节约方面，一个多月来，干部、职工节约储蓄增长了二万六千多元；各部门单清理库存积压物资就达八万多元，基本建设费用节约二十八万元，根据“可买可不买的坚决不买”的原则，节约办公用费达四万元。
    八中全会的公报和决议进一步鼓舞了全县机关干部、职工，人人满怀信心要实现计划。8月28日，县委会、医院、人委会等部门四十多名干部，天蒙蒙亮就下田进行地瓜施肥、锄草等田间管理，同时犁地种菜。大家说：“响应中央号召，要发扬革命优良传统，在增产节约的运动当中，干部要当先。”　	中共福建省漳浦县委
