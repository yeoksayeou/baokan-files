Technical Assistance from the Soviet Union and Eastern European Brotherly Countries to Our Country in the Past Decade
Li Qiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade

In the past decade, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, with soaring enthusiasm and arduous struggle, have achieved tremendous accomplishments. Currently, based on the great leap forward of 1958, the people of the whole country are striving with soaring enthusiasm to achieve the major targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule by the end of this year. In the past decade, in the construction of the national economy, we have resolutely implemented the principle of self-reliance as the mainstay and striving for foreign aid as a supplement. On the premise of self-reliance as the mainstay, we have strived for appropriate assistance from brotherly countries according to needs and possibilities. The technical assistance provided by the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to our country is an important condition for the socialist construction of our country to develop at a relatively high speed.

The technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union and Eastern European brotherly countries to our country is sincere assistance based on the spirit of internationalism. An important aspect of technical assistance is that they have helped our country design and equip approximately four hundred industrial enterprises. By the end of 1958, over one hundred of these enterprises had been fully or partially completed and put into production. Another important aspect of technical assistance is scientific and technological cooperation. In recent years, our country has obtained nearly five thousand items of information on scientific and technological achievements and production experience from the Soviet Union and Eastern European brotherly countries.

Among the brotherly countries, the Soviet Union has provided the most technical assistance to our country, and the scope is also the widest. During our country's First Five-Year Plan, the one hundred and sixty-six large-scale construction projects that the Soviet Union helped our country build became the core and backbone of industrial construction during our country's First Five-Year Plan. Among these enterprises are many important projects of the Anshan, Wuhan, and Baotou three major iron and steel complexes; there are the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory, Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant, Harbin Steam Turbine Plant, Lanzhou Petroleum and Chemical Equipment Plant, Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Manufacturing Plant, and other machinery industries. In addition, there are many important enterprises in non-ferrous metallurgy, coal, petroleum, electricity, chemical, aviation, telecommunications, and other industries, most of which are emerging industrial sectors in our country.

According to the two agreements on the Soviet Union's technical assistance to China in the construction and expansion of important industrial enterprises signed by the Chinese and Soviet governments in August 1958 and February 1959, the Soviet Union will also help our country build one hundred and twenty-five industrial projects, including metallurgy, chemical, coal, petroleum, machine manufacturing, radio technology, building materials industry, and power stations. The completion of these enterprises will further strengthen the backbone of our country's modern industry and help our country build a complete industrial system in the shortest possible time. Because our country has had a number of large-scale modern backbone enterprises with the help of the Soviet Union in the past few years, has a group of talents who can master new technologies, and has greatly improved in design, construction, and equipment manufacturing, therefore, for the Soviet Union's assistance to these one hundred and twenty-five projects, in addition to a part of the brand-new technical projects still being designed or technologically designed by the Soviet Union, providing complete sets or most of the equipment, most of the remaining projects will be surveyed and designed by our country itself, and the main equipment will be supplied by the Soviet Union. This fact fully shows that in recent years, with the rapid development of our national economy, especially after the great leap forward of the national economy in 1958, the production of industrial equipment in our country has developed rapidly, and the ability to self-supply equipment has greatly improved. Here, we should especially thank the Soviet Union for the promoting role of technical assistance to our country.

The Soviet Union's technical assistance to our country fully embodies a high degree of internationalism. In the various enterprises it has helped our country build, it not only provides the equipment needed by the enterprise, but also provides comprehensive and systematic assistance from surveying geology, selecting factory sites, collecting design basic data, conducting design, guiding construction, installation and commissioning, supplying technical information on new products, until new products are manufactured. In the past decade, thousands of factories and hundreds of design units in the Soviet Union have undertaken the arduous task of designing and supplying equipment, and thousands of outstanding experts have responded to the invitation of our government and traveled thousands of miles to our country to help our country carry out construction work with their superb technology and selfless labor. The Soviet Union has also accepted more than eight thousand trainees from our country, giving them various conveniences so that they can master advanced technology and manage modern enterprises in a short period of time. There are many specific and vivid examples of the Soviet Union's technical assistance to our country, which makes us very moved. For example, in order to help our country build the First Automobile Factory, the Soviet Union sent a large number of experts from several design agencies, integrated the construction experience of various automobile factories in the Soviet Union, and combined with the actual situation of our country, designed the newest type of automobile factory. Many of the equipment in this factory is also the latest type in the Soviet Union. For example, when the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise decided to put into production ahead of schedule last year, the Soviet Union supplied our country with the first seventy-ton weighing car that had just been produced in the country.

Scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is of great significance for helping our country improve the technical level of industrial sectors. Since the signing of the Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement between China and the Soviet Union in October 1954, our country has obtained more than 4,000 advanced and sophisticated technical data from the Soviet Union. These technical data have helped many economic sectors in our country solve many key production problems and many technical difficulties. According to the technical cooperation agreement, the Soviet Union also accepted many experts from our country to go to the Soviet Union for professional and technical inspections and invited our country to send representatives to participate in various scientific and technological conferences. Our country's twelve-year long-term plan for the development of science and technology has also received cooperation and assistance from the Soviet Union. The number of projects jointly carried out by the two countries and the Soviet Union's assistance to China in major scientific and technological research reached 122. It is worth mentioning that the Soviet Union provides our country with scientific, technological, and industrial assistance in the research on the peaceful use of atomic energy. As everyone knows, the first experimental atomic reactor and cyclotron that the Soviet Union helped our country build were put into operation last year. This is a typical example of the Soviet Union's selfless technical assistance to our country.

The Eastern European brotherly countries, according to their respective industrial and technical specialties, also gave our country great help with a high degree of internationalism. During our country's First Five-Year Plan, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and other brotherly countries helped our country build 68 industrial projects. These industrial projects are modern and technologically advanced enterprises, mainly including: coal mines, power stations, machinery manufacturing plants, telecommunications equipment plants, chemical industries, cement plants, sugar mills, film processing plants, and so on. The completion of these enterprises has played an active role in improving the level of modern industrial production in our country and accelerating the speed of our economic construction. In the process of building enterprises, the Eastern European brotherly countries, like the Soviet Union, used their most advanced and sophisticated technology and sent the most outstanding experts to help our country. For example, Poland has provided extremely valuable assistance to our country in the technology of using the freezing method to build coal mines on quicksand foundations, the German Democratic Republic in manufacturing complete sets of grinding wheels and radio parts, Czechoslovakia in manufacturing larger thermal power equipment and steam turbines and generators, as well as Romania and Hungary in petroleum drilling and geophysical exploration, and Bulgaria in mineral processing technology, in terms of technical assistance and training of technical cadres in our country. They will continue to provide our country with the complete sets of equipment and valuable technical assistance needed during our country's Second Five-Year Plan.

Our country has also carried out extensive scientific and technological cooperation with the Eastern European brotherly countries. By the end of 1958, these countries had provided our country with more than 800 technical data in various aspects such as machinery industry, chemical industry, textile industry, light industry, health, forestry, electricity, construction, coal, petroleum, metallurgy, and agriculture. The provision of these data will obviously help the high-speed development of our national economy and the progress of science and technology.

Now we are very happy to see that our country has been able to produce many kinds of new industrial products that our country has never had before, such as advanced alloy structural steel in the iron and steel industry, special instrument steel, silicon steel sheets, shipbuilding steel plates, composite stainless steel plates, seamless steel pipes for boilers, large I-beams, heavy steel rails and other important steel products; aircraft in the machinery industry, heavy-duty trucks, seagoing vessels with a load capacity of 10,000 tons, complete sets of thermal power equipment with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts and hydropower equipment with a capacity of 72,500 kilowatts, blast furnace equipment with a volume of 1,515 cubic meters, combined coal mining machines, more than 200 new types of machine tools, 2,300 mm medium plate rolling mills, 2,500 tons of forging hydraulic presses, automatic telephone exchanges, and complete sets of textile, paper making, sugar making and other equipment; chemical fibers in the chemical industry, advanced insulating materials organic silicone resins, various antibiotics and other products. These important technical achievements are the result of the full play of the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and staff, and at the same time, it is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries to our country.

Economic and technological cooperation and mutual assistance among socialist camp countries are an important aspect of the new type of socialist international relations, an important form of promoting the common economic upsurge of various countries, and a concrete manifestation of the lofty spirit of internationalism. In the future, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, and with the support of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, the Chinese people will continue to build their country in a leap forward posture, continue to improve the level of science and Technology, and build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and technology as soon as possible.

    十年来苏联和东欧兄弟国家对我国的技术援助
    对外贸易部副部长　李强
    十年来，我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，艰苦奋斗，取得了巨大的成就。现在，全国人民在1958年大跃进的基础上，正以冲天的干劲，力争在今年年底提前实现第二个五年计划的各项主要指标。十年来，在国民经济建设中，我们坚决地贯彻了自力更生为主、争取外援为辅的方针。在自力更生为主的前提下，根据需要和可能，从兄弟国家争取适当的援助。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国给予我国的技术援助，是我国社会主义建设事业能够以比较高的速度向前发展的重要条件。
    苏联和东欧各兄弟国家给予我国的技术援助是基于国际主义精神的真诚的援助。技术援助的一个重要方面，是它们帮助我国设计和装备了四百个左右的工业企业。这些企业，到1958年底止，已经有一百几十个全部建成和部分建成投入生产。技术援助的另一个重要方面是科学技术合作。几年来，我国从苏联和东欧各兄弟国家获得的科学技术成就和生产经验方面的资料将近五千多项。
    各兄弟国家中，苏联给予我国的技术援助最多，范围也最广。在我国第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我国建设的一百六十六个规模巨大的建设项目，成为我国第一个五年计划期间工业建设的核心和骨干。在这些企业中，有鞍山、武汉、包头三大钢铁联合企业的许多重要工程；有长春第一汽车厂、武汉重型机床厂、哈尔滨汽轮机厂、兰州炼油化工设备厂、洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂等机械工业。此外，在有色冶金、煤炭、石油、电力、化学、航空、电讯等工业方面还有许多重要企业，其中绝大部分是我国新兴的工业部门。
    根据1958年8月和1959年2月中苏两国政府先后签订的关于苏联在技术上援助中国建设和扩建重要工业企业的两项协定，苏联还将帮助我国建设包括冶金、化学、煤炭、石油、机器制造、无线电技术、建筑材料工业和电站等一百二十五个工业项目。这些企业的建成，将进一步增强我国现代工业的骨干力量，有助于我国在尽可能短的时间内建成一个完整的工业体系。由于我国过去几年在苏联帮助下已经有了一批规模宏大的现代化的骨干企业，有了一批能够掌握新技术的人才，在设计、施工和设备制造方面都有了很大的提高，因此，苏联对于这一百二十五个项目的援助，除了一部分崭新的技术项目仍然由苏联提供设计或工艺设计、提供全套或大部分设备以外，其余大部分项目都将由我国自己勘察、设计，而由苏联供应主要设备。从这一事实充分说明：近几年来，随着我国国民经济的迅速发展，特别是经过1958年国民经济的大跃进，我国工业设备的生产有了很快的发展，设备自给能力有了很大的提高，这里我们应当特别感谢苏联对我国的技术援助所起的促进作用。
    苏联对我国的技术援助充分体现了高度的国际主义精神。在它帮助我国建设的各项企业中，不仅提供了企业所需要的设备，而且从勘察地质、选择厂址、搜集设计基础资料，进行设计，指导建筑、安装和开工运转，供应新产品的技术资料，一直到新产品制造出来，都给予全面的系统的援助。十年来，苏联国内有成千个工厂、成百个设计单位承担了繁重的设计和供应设备的任务，而数以千计的优秀专家应我国政府的邀请，万里迢迢来到我国，以他们的精湛的技术和忘我的劳动，帮助我国进行建设工作。苏联还接受了我国八千多名的实习人员，给予他们各种便利条件，使他们在短期内能够掌握先进的技术和管理现代化的企业。苏联对我国的技术援助，有许多具体生动的事例，使我们十分感动。例如，苏联为了帮助我国建设第一汽车厂，曾派了好几个设计机关的大批专家，综合了苏联各汽车厂的建设经验，并结合我国的实际情况，设计出最新式的汽车厂。这个厂的许多设备在苏联也是最新式的。又如去年武汉钢铁联合企业第一号高炉决定提前投入生产时，苏联把国内刚刚生产出来的第一台七十吨称量车供应了我国。
    中苏两国的科学技术合作对于帮助我国提高工业部门的技术水平有着重大的意义。自从1954年10月中苏两国签订科学技术合作协定以来，我国从苏联取得了四千多项先进精湛的技术资料。这些技术资料，帮助我国许多经济部门解决了不少生产上的关键性问题和许多技术上的困难。根据技术合作协定，苏联还接受我国许多专家去苏联作专业技术考察，并邀请我国派代表参加各种科学技术会议。我国发展科学技术十二年远景规划，也得到苏联的合作和帮助。两国共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的项目达一百二十二个。值得特别提出的是，苏联在和平利用原子能的研究上给予我国科学技术和工业上的帮助。大家知道，苏联帮助我国建立的第一座实验性原子反应堆和回旋加速器去年就已投入运转，这是苏联对我国无私的技术援助的一个典型例子。
    东欧各兄弟国家根据他们各自在工业上和技术上的专长，也以高度的国际主义精神，给了我国很大的帮助。在我国第一个五年计划期间，德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚等兄弟国家帮助我国建设的工业项目就有六十八项。这些工业项目都是现代化的技术先进的企业，主要有：煤矿、电站、机械制造厂、电讯设备厂、化学工业、水泥厂、糖厂、影片洗印厂等等。这些企业的建成对提高我国现代化工业生产的水平，加速我国经济建设的速度，起了积极的作用。在建设企业的过程中，东欧各兄弟国家和苏联一样，都是用自己最先进、最精湛的技术，派遣最优秀的专家来帮助我国的。比如，波兰在流沙地基上用冷冻法建设煤井的技术方面，德意志民主共和国在制造成套砂轮和无线电零件等方面，捷克斯洛伐克在制造较大的火力发电设备和汽轮机、发电机等方面，以及罗马尼亚和匈牙利在石油钻探和地球物理勘测方面，保加利亚在选矿技术方面，都在技术援助和培养我国技术干部上给了我国极为宝贵的帮助。他们还将在我国第二个五年计划期间继续提供我国所需要的成套设备和宝贵的技术援助。
    我国与东欧各兄弟国家之间也进行了广泛的科学技术合作。到1958年底，这些国家在机械工业、化学工业、纺织工业、轻工业、卫生、林业、电力、建筑、煤炭、石油、冶金和农业等各方面提供我国的技术资料有八百多项，这些资料的提供，显然有助于我国国民经济的高速度发展和科学技术的进步。
    现在我们非常高兴地看到，我国已经能够生产许多种我国从来没有的新的工业产品，如钢铁工业方面的高级合金结构钢、特殊仪表用钢、矽钢片、造船钢板、复合不锈钢板、锅炉用无缝钢管、大型工字钢、重型钢轨等重要钢材；机械工业方面的飞机、载重汽车、载重量一万吨的海轮、容量二万五千瓩的成套火力发电设备和七万二千五百瓩水力发电设备、容积一千五百一十五立方米的高炉设备、联合采煤机、二百多种新型机床、二千三百公厘中板轧机、二千五百吨的锻造水压机、自动电话交换机以及全套纺织、造纸、制糖等设备；化学工业方面的化学纤维、高级绝缘材料有机硅树脂、各种抗菌素等产品。这些技术上的重要成就，是广大职工充分发挥了积极性和创造性的结果，同时也是同苏联和其他兄弟国家对我国的帮助分不开的。
    社会主义阵营各国之间实行经济技术合作和互相支援，是新型的社会主义国际关系的一个重要方面，是促进各国经济共同高涨的一个重要形式，是崇高的国际主义精神的具体表现。今后中国人民将在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在苏联和各兄弟国家的支援下，继续以跃进的姿态建设自己的国家，继续提高科学技术水平，尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。（附图片）
