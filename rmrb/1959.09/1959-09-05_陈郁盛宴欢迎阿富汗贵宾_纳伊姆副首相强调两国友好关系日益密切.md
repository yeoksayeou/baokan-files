Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 4th. Guangdong Province Governor Chen Yu held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammad Naim Khan, and his entourage.

　　At the banquet, Chen Yu, on behalf of the people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests. He said: Since ancient times, China and Afghanistan have maintained harmonious and friendly relations. This friendly relationship has, since the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and Afghanistan in 1955, and especially through the mutual visits of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Daud in 1957, been further enhanced and developed on a new basis. Therefore, in recent years, cultural exchanges and trade between the two countries have become increasingly frequent. We believe that through the Vice Prime Minister's friendly visit to our country, mutual understanding between the people of our two countries will be further deepened, and the profound friendship between the people of the Kingdom of Afghanistan and the people of our country will be strengthened.

　　Vice Prime Minister Naim then spoke amidst warm applause. He said that the friendship between the people of China and Afghanistan has a long history dating back to ancient times, and this harmonious and friendly relationship should be calculated in millennia. He said: When we talk about the achievements of today's world, no one can ignore the great achievements of the Chinese people. The Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people is known to the whole world. As your friends, we are very happy about your Great Leap Forward achievements.

　　Vice Prime Minister Naim said: Although our two countries have different social systems, the friendship between our two peoples has a long history, and we share the common desire to build our own countries in a peaceful environment. I believe that the friendly relations between our two countries will become increasingly close.

　　Attending tonight's banquet were: Lin Qiangyun, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Jiao Linyi and Zhang Ruiquan, Vice Mayors of Guangzhou City, Lieutenant General Zhan Caifang, Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, as well as responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations.

　　Also present at the banquet were Czechoslovak Consul in Guangzhou, Kopek, Polish Consul in Guangzhou, Wigorski, and Le Chung Si, Acting Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou.

　　This afternoon, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Jiao Linyi, Vice Mayor of Guangzhou City, and others, visited the Huaisheng Mosque, Yuexiu Park, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and the cityscape of Guangzhou.
