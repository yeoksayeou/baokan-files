Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 23rd: Shanghai industry successfully trial-produced over 13,700 new products (including new varieties and new designs) in the first eight months of this year, more than 14% higher than the total trial-produced in the entire year of last year. Among them, high-grade, precision, and large-scale products are also more numerous than in any previous year. Currently, new products are emerging in large numbers, vying to offer gifts for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

Shanghai's metallurgical industry has added more than thirty new steel grades and steel products this year, including ball bearing steel, high-speed steel, alloy structural steel, and alloy tool steel. A high-grade alloy steel, refined by the Shanghai Turbine Factory in a three-ton small electric furnace, can be used to manufacture turbine rotors and is of the same quality as imported products. In terms of non-ferrous metals, nearly ten kinds of high-grade alloys have also been made this year.

Shanghai's machinery industry has successfully trial-produced 294 new products and 70 matching parts and components. The electrical machinery industry has also successfully trial-produced 498 new products and 88 parts and components. Many of these new products are large-scale equipment, including thin-plate rolling mills and medium-plate rolling mills for the iron and steel industry, and large-scale roll grinders weighing 45 tons and measuring 9 meters in length. There are also large-capacity complete sets of power generation equipment, high-voltage power transmission and distribution equipment, high-insulation and high-temperature resistant cables and wires, and precision instruments and meters. China's first three-coil 220,000-volt large transformer with a capacity of 30,000 kVA was successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant in August. This transformer weighs 135 tons and is as tall as a twelve-story building. Many pieces of equipment supporting key construction projects have been successively shipped to various parts of the country. In order to gradually solve the contradiction of insufficient large-scale equipment manufacturing capacity in Shanghai, Shanghai has also armed itself with large machine tools such as the 2-meter automatic hobbing machine, which was successfully trial-produced this year.

The chemical industry, textile industry, and light industry sectors have also produced many colorful new daily-use products this year, many of which are high-end consumer goods, such as Shanghai brand high-grade gold pens, Shanghai brand high-grade ballpoint pens, and 200-count two-ply linen yarn.

In order to adapt to the needs of the continued leap forward in national production and construction and the further improvement of people's lives this year, Shanghai's industrial sectors comprehensively arranged the progress of new product trial production when formulating this year's technical plan at the beginning of the year, and strengthened leadership in this regard by adopting methods such as regular inspections and mutual collaboration. The connection with relevant scientific research departments has also been greatly strengthened, which has powerfully promoted the improvement of Shanghai's industrial technology level.

    比往年制得多  比往年制得好
    上海试制成功一万多种新产品
    新华社上海23日电　上海工业今年头八个月试制成功一万三千七百多种新产品（包括新品种和新花色的产品），比去年全年试制成功的还要多14％以上。其中，高级的、精密的、大型的产品也比过去任何一年多。目前，新产品还在大量涌现，竞向建国十周年献礼。
    上海冶金工业今年增加了三十多种新的钢种和钢材，其中包括滚珠钢、锋钢、合金结构钢、合金工具钢等。上海汽轮机厂在三吨小电炉中炼出的一种高级合金钢，可以用来制造汽轮机上的叶轮，质量同进口货完全一样。在有色金属方面，今年以来也制成了近十种高级合金。
    上海机械工业试制成功了二百九十四种新产品和七十种配套用的零件部件。电机工业也试制成功了四百九十八种新产品和八十八种零件部件。这些新产品很多是大型设备，有装备钢铁工业的薄板轧机和中板轧机，重达四十五吨、长达九米的大型轧辊磨床等。还有大容量的成套发电设备，高电压输电、配电设备，高绝缘耐高温的电缆电线，精密的仪器仪表等。我国第一台三线圈二十二万伏、容量有三万千伏安的大型变压器，8月份已在上海电机厂试制成功，这台变压器有一百三十五吨重，十二层楼房那样高。许多支援重点建设的设备，已经陆续运往全国各地。为了逐步解决上海本地大型设备能力不足的矛盾，上海今年还用试制成功的二米自动滚齿机等大型工作母机武装了自己。
    化学工业、纺织工业、轻工业部门，今年也制成了许多丰富多采的日用新产品，其中有许多是高级消费品，如上海牌高级金笔、上海牌高级圆珠笔、二百支双股麻纱等。
    为了适应今年国家生产建设继续跃进和人民生活进一步改善的需要，上海市各工业行业在年初制订今年技术规划时，就全面安排了新产品试制工作的进度，采取定期检查、相互协作等办法加强了这方面的领导。和有关科学研究部门之间的联系也大大加强，有力地推动了上海工业技术水平的提高。
