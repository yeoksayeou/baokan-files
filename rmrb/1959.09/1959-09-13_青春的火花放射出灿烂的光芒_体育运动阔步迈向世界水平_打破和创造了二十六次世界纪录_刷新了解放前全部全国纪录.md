Xinhua News Agency, September 12th: Our reporter Wen Jing reports: The First National Games, opening on the 13th, will review the glorious achievements of our country's sports in the past ten years, demonstrating that on the basis of the rapid development of socialist economic construction, sports are also leaping towards a higher level. This is unprecedented in any era in our country's history.

	Leaping onto the World Stage

	Before liberation, the Chinese people suffered from hunger and cold, were insulted and humiliated, and for many years bore the shameful title of "Sick Man of East Asia." China had no place on the world sports stage.

	In the ten years since liberation, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. With the rapid development of national socialist construction, the sports cause has also taken giant strides, forging ahead courageously. Although our country's sports cause is still very young, and many projects are newly built, even so, it has already burst out with the spark of youth, radiating brilliant light.

	In the Kuomintang era, many sports projects did not produce a new record for ten or twenty years. Taking track and field as an example, from 1936 to 1948, in thirteen years, national records only changed ten times. Even the highest-level records at that time were far behind world levels, some lagging behind by ten or even decades. This was not because the Chinese people lacked talent in sports, but because sports simply could not take root among the broad masses, and people's talents in sports could not be developed.

	New China's sports started on such a backward foundation, and had to complete the journey of lagging behind the world level by ten or even decades in the shortest possible time. This task is arduous and glorious. By 1958, Chinese athletes had already broken all pre-liberation national records, and every year they raised many national records to higher levels on a new basis. Every year, it was not just a few people who broke national records, but dozens or even hundreds of people; the number of times broken was not just a few times, but dozens or even hundreds of times. According to incomplete statistics, by August of this year, a total of 1,366 athletes across the country have created and broken 2,805 national records over the years. Among them, in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, 472 people broke national records 840 times, a situation that is unprecedented.

	After breaking most of the old national records from before liberation, Chinese athletes continued to ride the waves and began to sound the horn of marching towards world levels. By 1956, the young weightlifter Chen Jingkai broke the world record for the first time. From then on, in just over three years, 33 male and female athletes across the country have broken and created 26 world records, and a world champion has emerged, making our country's sports career stand out on the world sports stage.

	The speed at which Chinese athletes are leaping towards world levels is extremely fast. When the famous weightlifter Chen Jingkai participated in the national weightlifting competition for the first time in 1955 at the age of nineteen, his clean and jerk result was only 95 kilograms, but just over a year later, in June 1956, he broke the world record for the featherweight clean and jerk held by the American athlete Vinci with a result of 133 kilograms. When the famous Chinese female high jumper Zheng Fengrong participated in the national track and field competition for the first time in 1953 at the age of sixteen, her high jump result was only 1.36 meters, but by 1957 she jumped over 1.77 meters, breaking the world record held by the American athlete McDaniel. The vast majority of China's female mountaineering athletes broke the world female mountaineering record after less than a year of training, and climbed Mount Muztagh Ata, which is 7,546 meters above sea level. When China's table tennis team participated in the World Championships for the first time in 1953, the men's team was rated as tenth in the first division, and the women's team was third in the second division. By 1959, when Chinese athletes participated in the World Table Tennis Championships for the fourth time, both the men's and women's teams were listed as third in the first division. Twenty-one-year-old Rong Guotuan won the world men's singles championship, which had been held by Japanese athletes for many years, on his first participation in a world competition.

	Taking Deep Root Among the Masses

	In old China, sports were an embellishment, with only a few people participating, and the broad masses of working people were excluded from the gates of sports venues. At that time, the few sports venues became places of entertainment for Western colonialists who lived by exploiting the Chinese people and the so-called "upper-class Chinese," and some used sports competitions as gambling that led to bankruptcy.

	After liberation, millions of workers and peasants who were not worried about food and clothing had the opportunity to participate in sports for the first time. From cities to the countryside, from the interior to the border areas, sports are being widely carried out. Sports have become an indispensable part of people's lives. The number of sports projects carried out in our country has also developed from a dozen or so in the early days of liberation to the current forty or so.

	Over the past ten years, outstanding athletes have continued to emerge from the ranks of workers and peasants. For example, Liu Erzhu, a dock worker from Shanghai, was once selected as a member of China's national men's basketball team; Lin Jinzhu, a swimming athlete from a hired peasant family, is the national record holder for the men's 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle; Yang Ruihua, who once entered the top eight in the men's singles at the 25th World Table Tennis Championships, is a worker at the Shanghai Turbine Factory; and China's national men's volleyball team has always had many players from rural areas in Taishan County, Guangdong.

	The Chinese people's interest in sports is growing stronger. Currently, about hundreds of millions of people across the country participate in various sports activities. Not long ago, when a grassroots table tennis competition was held in Xidan District, Beijing, more than 10,000 people participated. In March of this year, Guangdong Province held a long-distance relay race throughout the province, with a total length of 3,199 kilometers. Each section was made up of a relay team of 15 athletes from nearby people's communes, factories, mines, and government agencies. The total number of participants also reached about 10,000 people.

	Our country holds various national sports competitions every year, and these competitions have also become a huge force in promoting the further development of mass sports and improving the level of sports in our country. When the first National Workers' Sports Games was held in Beijing in 1955, a total of more than 1,700 employee athletes participated, and more than one million employees participated in the selection competitions in various places. Ten employee athletes broke eight national records in the competition. This year, a total of more than 10,600 athletes participated in the first National Games, and a total of more than 50 million people participated in the selection competitions in various places.

	At present, a large army of sports enthusiasts has emerged from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers across the country, including a large number of graded athletes and 1,044 masters of sports. They are all athletes with relatively high technical levels and sports achievements who are quite close to each other. This sports army is young and progresses quickly. Wang Jinyu, a seventeen-year-old middle school student from Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, has only been learning to skate for three years, but he was already among the best in the international and world speed skating championships this year; Chong Xiuyun, a nineteen-year-old rural girl from Jiangsu, was an unknown athlete a few months ago, but today she has become the woman who throws the shot put the farthest in Asia; Yu Lie, a nineteen-year-old male gymnast from Shanghai, was still participating in the National Junior Games three years ago, but today he has become one of the strongest gymnasts in our country, and has won the all-around championship in international competitions more than once in the past year.

	Growing Up Under the Care of the Party

	Our country's sports have always been cared for and strongly supported by the Party and the government, and have grown rapidly with the development of the country's socialist economic construction.

	After the liberation of the whole country, the state established special sports agencies to lead and carry out sports activities. In large and medium-sized cities across the country, in addition to renovating and expanding the original sports venues, a large number of sports fields have also been built. There are now more than 4,000 large and medium-sized stadiums, gymnasiums, swimming pools, parachute towers, racing tracks, racetracks, and sailing and aviation clubs, providing the masses with broad sports activity venues. Among them, the Beijing Workers' Stadium, which was newly completed this year, can accommodate more people than all the sports venues in Beijing before liberation combined. In various places, many industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, military units, and rural people's communes have also established a larger number of sports venues of various sizes to carry out sports activities.

	Over the past ten years, New China's sports cause has leaped forward. In particular, comparing the deserted situation of sports before liberation with the achievements of today, it is clearer to see that this leap forward is huge. However, our country's current sports level is still somewhat distant from the world level. We must continue to exert our efforts, strive for the top, and under the leadership of the Party, unite sports workers across the country to push our country's sports cause to a new peak.

    青春的火花放射出灿烂的光芒
    体育运动阔步迈向世界水平
    打破和创造了二十六次世界纪录　刷新了解放前全部全国纪录
    据新华社12日讯　本社记者文敬报道：13日开幕的第一届全国运动会，将检阅我国体育运动十年来的辉煌成就，显示我国在社会主义经济建设飞速发展的基础上，体育运动也向更高水平飞跃迈进。这是我国历史上任何时代所未有过的。
    跃登世界舞台
    解放前，我国人民啼饥号寒，被侮辱，被损害，多少年来背负着一个耻辱的“东亚病夫”的称号，世界体育舞台上是没有中国的地位的。
    在解放后的十年来，这一情况发生了根本的变化。随着国家社会主义建设的飞速发展，体育事业也像巨人迈开巨步，勇往直前。我国的体育事业虽然还很年轻，不少项目还属新建，但就是这样，也已经迸出青春的火花，射出灿烂的光芒。
    国民党时代，许多体育运动项目十年、二十年都出不了一个新纪录。以田径运动为例，从1936年到1948年的十三年中，全国纪录只改变了十次。即使是当时水平最高的纪录，也远远落后于世界水平，有的落后上十年甚至几十年。这并不是因为我国人民缺乏体育运动方面的才能，而是因为那时候体育运动根本不能在广大群众中生根，人们在体育方面的才能得不到发挥。
    新中国的体育运动就是在如此落后的基础上，要在最短的时间内，走完落后于世界水平上十年甚至几十年的路程。这个任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。我国运动员到1958年为止，就已经全部刷新了解放前的全国纪录，而且每年又在新的基础上把许多全国纪录提到更高的水平。每年，打破全国纪录的不只是几个人，而是几十人甚至上百人；打破的次数也不只是几次、而是几十次甚至上百次。据不完全统计，到今年8月止，全国共有一千三百六十六名运动员历年来共创造和打破了二千八百零五次全国纪录。其中在大跃进的1958年，就有四百七十二人八百四十次打破了全国纪录，这种情况是史无前例的。
    我国运动员在刷新了解放前大部分旧的全国纪录之后，继续乘风破浪，开始吹起了向世界水平迈进的号角。到了1956年，年轻的举重运动员陈镜开就第一次打破了世界纪录。从那时起，仅仅三年多的时间，全国已有三十三名男、女运动员共打破和创造了二十六次世界纪录，并且出现了一个世界冠军，使我国体育事业在世界体育舞台上崭露头角。
    我国体育运动健儿向世界水平跃进的速度是飞快的。著名的举重选手陈镜开当1955年十九岁第一次参加全国举重比赛时，挺举成绩还只有九十五公斤，但才过了一年多，到1956年6月，他就以一百三十三公斤的成绩打破了美国选手温奇保持的最轻量级挺举世界纪录。我国著名的女子跳高选手郑凤荣当1953年十六岁第一次参加全国田径比赛时，跳高成绩只有一米三十六，但到1957年她就跳过了一米七十七，打破了美国选手麦克丹尼尔保持的世界纪录。我国的女子登山运动员，绝大部分人只经过了不到一年的练习，就打破了世界女子登山纪录，登上了拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格峰。我国乒乓球队1953年第一次参加世界锦标赛时，男队被评为第一级第十名，女队是第二级第三名。而到1959年我国选手第四次参加世界乒乓球锦标赛时，男、女队都被列为第一级的第三名。二十一岁的容国团第一次参加世界比赛，就夺得了为日本选手保持了多届的世界男子单打冠军。
    在群众中扎下深根
    在旧中国，体育运动是一种点缀，只有少数人参加，广大的劳动人民被排斥在体育运动场所的大门之外。那时候，为数不多的体育场地，成为以剥削我国人民为生的西方殖民主义者和所谓的“高等华人”的玩乐之地，有的把体育比赛作为倾家荡产的赌博。
    解放以后，千百万不愁衣、食的工人、农民，第一次有了参加体育运动的机会。从城市到农村，从内地到边疆，体育运动都在广泛地开展。体育运动已经成为人民生活中不可缺少的一部分。我国开展的体育运动项目，也由解放初期的十几项发展为目前的四十几项。
    十年来，从工农劳动人民的行列中，不断涌现出优秀的运动员。像上海的码头工人刘二柱，曾经被选为我国国家男子篮球队的队员；雇农家庭出身的游泳选手林锦珠，是我国男子一百米和二百米自由泳的全国纪录保持者；曾经进入第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛男子单打前八名的杨瑞华，是上海汽轮机厂的工人；我国历年来的国家男子排球队中，都拥有不少来自广东台山县农村的选手。
    我国人民对体育运动的兴趣越来越浓厚。目前全国约有上亿人参加各种各样的体育活动。不久前仅在北京西单区举行基层乒乓球比赛时，参加的就超过了一万人。广东省今年3月间曾经在全省范围内举行长途接力赛，全长达三千一百九十九公里。各段由附近的人民公社、厂矿、机关派十五名选手组成接力队。参加的总数也达到一万人左右。
    我国每年都要举行各种规模的全国性体育运动比赛，这些比赛也成了推动群众性体育运动进一步开展和提高我国体育运动水平的巨大力量。1955年在北京举行第一届全国工人体育运动大会时，共有一千七百多名职工选手参加，各地参加选拔赛的职工超过了一百多万人。比赛中有十名职工选手打破了八项全国纪录。今年参加第一届全国运动会的选手共一万零六百多人，而参加各地选拔赛的共有五千多万人。
    目前，全国从工农商学兵各行各业中已涌现出一支人数众多的体育运动大军，其中包括了大批的等级运动员和一千零四十四名运动健将。他们都是技术水平和运动成绩相当高又相当接近的选手。这支体育运动大军年纪轻，进步快。十七岁的黑龙江省鹤岗市的中学生王金玉，学习滑冰只有三年的光景，但是他在今年的国际和世界速度滑冰锦标赛中就已名列前茅；十九岁的江苏农村姑娘崇秀云，几个月以前还是默默无闻的选手，但今天已经成为亚洲女子铅球推得最远的人；上海十九岁的男子体操选手于烈烽三年前还在参加全国少年运动会，而今天却已成了我国最强的体操运动员之一，一年多来已经不止一次地在国际比赛中获得了全能冠军的称号。
    在党的关怀下成长
    我国的体育运动一直受到党和政府的关怀和大力支持，随着国家社会主义经济建设的发展而迅速成长。
    全国解放后，国家就设立了专门的体育机构，领导开展体育运动。在全国大、中城市，除培修扩建了原有的体育运动场所外，还兴建了大量的运动场地，现在已有四千多个大、中型的运动场、体育馆、游泳池、跳伞塔、赛车场、赛马场以及航海和航空俱乐部，使群众有广阔的体育活动场所。其中单是今年新落成的北京工人体育场，容纳的人数就超过解放前北京所有的运动场所能容纳的人数的总和。各地还有许多工矿企业、机关、部队单位和农村人民公社，建立了为数更多的大小不同的运动场所，开展体育运动。
    十年来，新中国的体育事业在飞跃前进，特别是把解放前体育运动的冷落的情况和现在的成就加以对比，更清楚地可以看到这种跃进的步伐是巨大的。但是，我国目前的体育水平和世界水平相比，还有一定的距离。我们必须继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，在党的领导下，团结全国体育工作者，把我国体育事业推进到一个新的高峰。（附图片）
