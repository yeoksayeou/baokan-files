"Gloomy" and Brightness
Zheng Xiang

Imperialism and domestic hostile elements are our mortal enemies and also the best negative mirror. What we cheer, they curse; what we hate, they rejoice in; when we encounter temporary difficulties and local shortcomings in our advance, they clap their hands and cheer; when we correct and overcome shortcomings and difficulties and advance rapidly, they resent and curse endlessly.

They are wolves by nature, but sometimes they try to seize the opportunity to put on a "compassionate" face. In the first half of this year, when we were beginning to overcome some local and temporary difficulties on the road ahead, they used desperate curses as bullets to fire at us, saying that we are now facing "one of the gloomiest years," and so on. Listen to these lies, as if they are very willing for us to reach the sky in one step and live a bright and happy life, but, "Alas! It's so bad...".

These are truly the tears of the devil! We are not forgetful. Last year, when we achieved unprecedented brilliant victories in accordance with the Party's General Line, and the People's Commune appeared on the eastern horizon of Asia like a rising sun, the great wisdom and power of the Chinese people burst out with immense brilliance, which terrified the enemy, who went into frenzied convulsions and endless abuse. Why was that?

The Chinese people will neither be intimidated by the enemy's curses and attacks, nor will they be bewitched by the devil's tears. We are advancing valiantly with the force of a thunderbolt! The enemy vainly hoped that the People's Commune would be short-lived and die young, like a shooting star that flashes and disappears; what was the result? It withstood the test of this year's severe natural disasters and became stronger and stronger. Its power is becoming greater and greater.

Speaking of "gloom," the Chinese people have suffered countless disasters over the long years due to imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and the suffering caused by the small-scale peasant economy. This year's severe drought reminded me of the tragic scenes of the Henan drought in 1942. My family was in Henan and suffered greatly from it. At that time, the sky did not rain, the fields cracked, the crops turned yellow, and locusts flew in, covering the sky and the earth, eating up the crops. People beat their chests and stamped their feet, wailing and crying, but who cared? That autumn, I traveled from Yuxian through Xuchang to Yanling and Fugou. Along the way, I only saw that all edible tree leaves had been stripped bare, and Guanyin earth and weeds from rotten ponds became delicacies. Many villages could hardly hear the sound of chickens and dogs, or see the smoke of human habitation, and truly became deserted. On the main road, the staggering hungry people, walking and walking, mouths drooling yellow water, falling down and never getting up again were everywhere. In that year, more than three million people starved to death in Henan. Of course, there were also those who did not flee and did not go hungry, and those were the landlords and Kuomintang officials. They were afraid that the starving people would rebel, so they hid in the deep houses and courtyards of the towns and cities, spending their days drinking and eating their fill. There were also those who extorted and blackmailed, acted as human traffickers and made profits from it, and those who exploited heavily and lent money at usurious rates. What kind of world was that? The working people were in darkness, starving to death in ditches. But when did we ever hear imperialism and domestic hostile elements say it was gloomy! Now, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, the confidence and drive of the people to "man can conquer nature," and the People's Commune, more than 200 million mu of crops, which suffered far more damage than in 1942, have turned from withered yellow to green, flourishing, turning major disasters into minor ones, and turning poor harvests into bumper harvests, they are clamoring about "the gloomiest year." Isn't their wolfish nature exposed without being peeled off?

It is not surprising that the enemy spares no effort to spread rumors, slander, and viciously attack our every victory, because they are walking the dark road and speaking the dark language, like bats that cannot see the sun. What is particularly alarming is that some wavering elements in our ranks, when they hear the enemy's gloomy voices against our General Line, Great Leap Forward, and People's Commune movement, not only do not feel angry, but find it pleasing to the ear: some even echo them, pouring cold water on our people, spreading pessimistic emotions within us, trying to demoralize us, turning a bright and beautiful world into a pitch-black mess in their mouths. Such people are either closing their eyes and not looking at reality, or are black-hearted and willing to serve the enemy. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee has already sounded the alarm for them. If they do not repent, their future is indeed very bleak, while our future is always infinitely bright!

### “暗淡”和光明

    “暗淡”和光明
    郑襄
    帝国主义和国内敌对分子，是我们的生死对头，也是一面最好的反面镜。我们欢呼的他们诅咒；我们憎恶的他们高兴；我们在前进途中发生了暂时的困难和局部的缺点，他们拍手称快；我们纠正了克服了缺点和困难，向前猛进了，他们又怨恨咒骂不已。
    他们本是豺狼，但有时却要窥伺时机，装出一副“悲天悯人”相。今年上半年，当我们正在动手克服前进道路上的一些局部和暂时的困难的时候，他们便以绝望的诅咒当枪弹向我们打来，说什么我们现在正面临着“最暗淡的年份之一”，等等。听听他们这些谎言吧，好像他们倒是非常愿意我们一步登天，过光明幸福日子，可是，“唉！竟这么糟……”。
    这真是魔鬼的眼泪！我们并不健忘。去年，当我们按照党的总路线取得了史无前例的辉煌胜利，人民公社像初升太阳出现在亚洲东部地平线上的时候，中国人民的伟大智慧和力量迸发出来的万丈光彩，使敌人惊恐万状，他们发疯痉挛，恶骂不止，这又是所为何来？
    中国人民既不会被敌人的咒骂攻击吓住，也不会被魔鬼的眼泪蛊惑。我们正在以雷霆万钧之势奋勇直前！敌人妄想人民公社短命夭折，像一颗流星一闪逝去；结果怎样？它经住了今年严重的自然灾害的考验，愈战愈壮。它的威力，越发挥越大。
    若提起“暗淡”，中国人民在漫长的年月里，由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义所带来的灾难，由于小农经济所造成的痛苦，那真是数不胜数。今年的大旱灾，使我想起1942年河南旱灾的悲惨景象。我的家在河南，曾深受其祸。那时候，老天不下雨，田地龟裂了，庄稼焦黄了，又蔽天盖地飞来了蝗虫，把庄稼吃个净光。人们捶胸顿足，嚎啕恸哭，有谁来过问？那年秋天，我从禹县经许昌，到鄢陵、扶沟一带，一路上只见凡能吃的树叶被捋光了，观音土、烂塘里的杂草成为食物中的佳品。许多村庄难听到鸡犬之声，难看到人间烟火，真正变成十室九空了。大路上摇摇晃晃的饥饿人群，走着走着，嘴流黄水，倒下去再起不来的比比皆是。这一年，河南生生饿死了三百多万人。当然，也有不逃去的，也有不挨饿的，那是地主和国民党的官员。他们生怕饥民造反，躲进城镇的深宅大院，终日醉酒饱食的也有，敲诈勒索做人口贩子从中取利的也有，重利盘剥放高利贷的也有。那时是什么世界？劳动人民昏天暗地，饿死沟壑。但又何曾听到帝国主义和国内敌对分子说过它暗淡！如今，由于有了共产党的领导，有了人民群众“人定胜天”的信心和干劲，有了人民公社，使今年远远超过1942年灾情的两亿多亩庄稼由枯黄变青绿，欣欣向荣，大灾化小，歉收变丰收，他们倒叫嚣起“最暗淡的年份”来了。他们的豺狼本相不是不剥自露吗？
    敌人对我们的每一胜利，不遗余力造谣、诽谤、恶毒攻击，原不足为怪，因为他们走的是黑路，说的是黑话，像蝙蝠一样见不得太阳。值得特别警惕的是我们队伍里的一些不坚定分子，听到敌人对我们的总线路、大跃进、人民公社运动发出的暗淡声，不但不感愤怒，反觉悦耳：有的竟随声附和起来，向我们的人大泼冷水，在我们内部散布悲观情绪，企图涣散斗志，好端端一个光明世界，在他的嘴里变成一团漆黑。这种人，不是闭着眼不看现实，就是黑了心甘愿投效敌人。党的八中全会，已经给他们敲起了警钟，若不憣然悔悟，他们的前途倒真是十分暗淡，而我们的前途永远是无限光明的！
