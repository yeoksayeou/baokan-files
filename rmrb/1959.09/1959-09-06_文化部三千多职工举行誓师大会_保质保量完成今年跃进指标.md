    More than 3,000 Employees of the Ministry of Culture Hold a Rally
    Guaranteeing the Quality and Quantity of This Year's Leap Forward Targets

    (Our dispatch) On the afternoon of August 30th, the Ministry of Culture held a "Oppose Rightism, Encourage Exertion, Launch an Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement" leap forward rally at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall. More than 3,800 employees of the Ministry of Culture and its directly affiliated units in Beijing attended the meeting. The meeting called on all employees to take immediate action, respond to the Party's battle call, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and launch a vigorous increase production and practice economy movement.

    Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting. He first elaborated on the great historical significance of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. He called on all employees to conscientiously study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, enhance their understanding, and arm themselves. Qian Junrui then analyzed the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes in 1958, and the continued leap forward situation in the first half of this year, proving the complete correctness of the Party's General Line; and forcefully criticized the right-leaning thoughts of negating the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, opposing the People's Communes, and opposing the large-scale steel production. In his report, Qian Junrui cited many facts to illustrate that all aspects of cultural work in 1958 had made great leaps forward, refuting the erroneous statement that "cultural work has not made a leap forward." He finally called on cultural workers to actively participate in the current increase production and practice economy movement, and together with the people of the whole country, continue to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, complete this year's leap forward targets for cultural work with soaring enthusiasm and guaranteed quality and quantity (ideological quality, work quality, artistic quality). He also emphasized concentrating efforts, with a fighting attitude, to engage in a fierce battle in September to complete the exhibition work of the Central Revolutionary Museum and the Historical Museum, and to complete the publication of fourteen outstanding films, outstanding art programs, and books to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day. At the same time, he required all cultural work cadres to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, strive to improve their theoretical level, conscientiously overcome empiricism and dogmatism in their thinking methods, and practice strict economy, carrying forward the Party's fine tradition of hard work and plain living.

    Qian Xiaozhang, Director of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, on behalf of all the factory's employees, made a guarantee at the meeting: to overcome difficulties in every possible way, work hard for four months, and resolutely complete and overfulfill the annual production target of 112 films (12 long documentaries and 100 short documentaries); and to take effective measures to ensure that the films produced in the future meet the requirements of having diverse styles, good quality, fast production, and low cost.

    Comrade Ma Ji of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, on behalf of all the researchers in the academy, expressed his determination at the meeting: to resolutely implement the policy of closely integrating research and teaching with practice, and serving the construction of a new socialist traditional opera, to ensure the continuous improvement of quality, continue to tap potential, and guarantee the completion of this year's research tasks. Their specific requirements are: to strive to complete various special studies and works ahead of schedule and on schedule, while ensuring quality; to mobilize the academy's research strength to complete the writing of "An Overview of Traditional Opera Art"; to compile six to eight kinds of small series of basic knowledge of traditional opera before National Day, and to complete the eighteen kinds of actor learning series (revised edition) ahead of schedule; to improve the quality of the "Drama Research" and "Traditional Opera Music" publications; and to ensure the completion of the teaching tasks for the newly opened classes of the Academy of Traditional Opera.

They unanimously supported the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and unanimously expressed that they would respond to the Party's great call with practical actions.
