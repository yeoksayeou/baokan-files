Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th - According to a Vietnam News Agency report: Kaysone Phomvihane, member of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and former Minister of Defense of the Lao Resistance Government, recently stated to a reporter from the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" that the United Nations Security Council's recent decision, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, to establish a so-called "investigation" group on the situation in Laos, violates international law, the UN Charter, and the 1954 Geneva Accords.

Kaysone pointed out that the purpose of this decision is to cover up the actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, who have consistently and seriously violated the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements, and to pave the way for armed intervention in Laos by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Southeast Asia. Therefore, this resolution will not only fail to resolve the Lao issue but will instead exacerbate the serious situation in Laos.

Kaysone said that the Lao people consider this a worthless resolution and resolutely oppose the UN Security Council's establishment of a so-called "investigation" group on the situation in Laos.

Kaysone said that the Sananikone government's submission of the Lao issue to the United Nations is an attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords, obstruct the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos, and continue to implement their most reactionary conspiracies. The current problem in Laos is the Lao people's opposition to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, demanding the fulfillment of the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements.

Answering a question about the causes of the current civil war, Kaysone pointed out that the main culprits creating the current civil war in our country are U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Phoui Sananikone clique, and the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests." He then recounted the facts of the United States and its lackeys instigating and expanding the civil war in Laos.

In response to a reporter's question on how to resolve the Lao issue, Kaysone said that the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people have always been unswervingly loyal to the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements, consistently adhering to the position of striving for a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, national harmony, and unified nation. We advocate actively seeking ways to resolve the Lao issue through peaceful and democratic means. In the past, when we administered two provinces and had tens of thousands of troops, we also conducted peaceful negotiations and signed the Vientiane Agreements for the highest interests of the nation and the earnest wishes of the Lao people. Now, if the Phoui Sananikone government has the sincerity to resolve the Lao issue peacefully, we can negotiate and consult with them based on respect for the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements. However, in order to create conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Lao issue, U.S. imperialism must stop its interference in Laos and withdraw its military personnel and weapons from Laos. The Lao Royal Government must stop its "sweeps" and suppression of the Lao people, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and the thousands of imprisoned patriotic fighters, and restore the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos.

Kaysone pointed out, "If the Phoui Sananikone government stubbornly acts as a running dog of the United States, continues to expand the civil war with U.S. weapons, kills our people, and conspires to allow foreign troops to once again invade and enslave our country, the Lao people will fight resolutely to the end. Our struggle is a just struggle, and we will surely win."

    凯山就安理会的非法决定发表谈话
    美国必须停止干涉老挝
    老挝人民为反对侵略将坚决战斗到底
    新华社河内10日电　据越南通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会委员、前寮国抗战政府国防部部长凯山最近向“老挝爱国报”记者发表谈话指出：联合国安全理事会最近在美帝国主义操纵下决定成立所谓“调查”老挝局势的小组委员会的行动，是违反国际法、违反联合国宪章和1954年日内瓦协议的。
    凯山指出，这个决定的目的在于掩盖美帝国主义及其走狗一向严重违反日内瓦协议和万象协议的行动，为美帝国主义以及它在东南亚的走狗武装干涉老挝铺平道路。因此，这个决议不但不能解决老挝问题，相反，还将加剧老挝的严重局势。
    凯山说，老挝人民认为这是毫无价值的决议，并坚决反对联合国安全理事会成立所谓“调查”老挝局势的小组委员会。
    凯山说，萨纳尼空政府把老挝问题提交联合国，是妄图破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠恢复老挝国际委员会的活动，继续实现他们的最反动的阴谋。老挝当前的问题是老挝人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗，要求履行日内瓦协议和万象协议。
    凯山在回答关于当前内战的原因问题时指出：制造我国当前内战的主犯是美帝国主义及其走狗培·萨纳尼空集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们。他接着叙述了美国及其走狗挑起和扩大老挝内战的事实。
    在回答记者提出的应该如何解决老挝问题的问题时，凯山说，老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民始终不渝地忠于日内瓦协议和万象协议，一向坚持为和平中立、独立民主、民族和睦和统一国家而奋斗的立场。我们主张积极想办法通过和平和民主的方式解决老挝问题。过去，当我们管理两个省和有几万军队的时候，为了民族的最高利益，为了老挝人民的恳切的愿望，我们也进行过和平谈判，签订万象协议。现在，如果培·萨纳尼空政府有和平解决老挝问题的诚意的话，我们就可以在尊重日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上同他们进行谈判和协商。但是，为了创造和平解决老挝问题的条件，美帝国主义必须停止对老挝的干涉，把军事人员和武器撤出老挝。老挝王国政府必须停止对老挝人民的“扫荡”和镇压，恢复苏发努冯亲王和被监禁的成千爱国战士的自由，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    凯山指出，“如果培·萨纳尼空政府顽固地充当美国的走狗，用美国的武器继续扩大内战，杀害我国人民，并阴谋让外国军队再一次侵略和奴役我国，老挝人民就坚决战斗到底。我们的斗争是正义的斗争，我们一定胜利。”
