By our reporter: Sichuan's Suining County has widely convened on-site comparison meetings during the autumn harvest to educate the masses on implementing the spirit of increased production and conservation, and to exchange advanced experiences, powerfully promoting the mass movement of meticulous harvesting.

On-site comparison meetings are an effective method adopted by Party organizations at all levels in Suining County to launch mass movements and lead the great leap forward in production. During this year's autumn harvest, the method of on-site comparison meetings has been more widely adopted by all communes, management districts, and production teams throughout the county, with extremely significant results. The First Team and Second Team of the Tenth Management District of Yunfeng Commune have similar natural conditions, and their estimated yields for this year are also similar to last year's. However, due to the different attitudes of the two teams towards the harvesting work, the actual yields of the already harvested rice fields vary greatly. The First Team averages more than 30 jin per mu compared to the Second Team. The management district convened a field meeting here. Through observing the harvesting work and chatting with the members of the two teams, the attendees found that the reason why the harvesting work of the First Team was so well done was because they paid attention to educating the members to practice strict economy from the very beginning. The whole team, regardless of men, women, old or young, used their brains and worked hard to ensure that every grain was stored. Therefore, less than three jin of grain were scattered per mu. Some members of the Second Team had the idea of "half from heaven, half from earth," and the Party branch did not promptly educate the members on practicing strict economy, resulting in great losses during harvesting and threshing, with an average of more than 30 jin of rice scattered per mu. After finding out the reason, the Second Team further realized the importance of ideological work, continued to develop their advantages, accepted the lessons learned, mobilized the members to re-thresh the rice straw that had not been thoroughly threshed, and added canopies to all the threshing machines to prevent scattering, quickly catching up with the First Team.

In the on-site comparison meetings, cadres in various places, through "on-site" observation, comparison, and analysis of the advanced and backward, more clearly saw the obviously different results caused by different harvesting measures and operating techniques, and were more convinced of the advanced experiences. Some places initially did not seriously implement measures such as adding canopies to threshing machines and organizing children to pick up rice, thinking that these were "unimportant." However, through the on-site comparison meetings, everyone saw the actual results and actively took measures after returning.

Due to the implementation of meticulous harvesting measures in all aspects of the harvesting work, the county has recovered nearly 10 million jin of additional rice. (Attached picture)

### 召开对比现场会议　教育群众精打细收  遂宁多收回稻谷近一千万斤

    召开对比现场会议　教育群众精打细收
    遂宁多收回稻谷近一千万斤
    本报讯　四川遂宁县在秋收中广泛召开对比现场会议，教育群众贯彻增产节约的精神，交流先进经验，有力地推动了精打细收的群众运动。
    对比现场会议，是遂宁县各级党组织大搞群众运动，领导生产大跃进的行之有效的一种方法。在今年秋收中，对比现场会议的方法更广泛地被全县各公社、管理区和生产队采用，效果极为显著。云丰公社第十管理区第一小队和第二小队自然条件相同，去年亩产和今年的估产情况也相差不多，但由于两队对收获工作的态度不同，已收割的一部分稻田的实际产量却相差很大，一队每亩田平均要比二队多收三十斤以上。管理区就在这里召开了现场会议。通过观摩收割工作以及与两队社员漫谈，到会者发现，一队收割工作所以搞得好，是由于他们一开始就注意教育社员厉行节约，全队不论男女老少都为颗粒归仓动脑筋、下功夫，因此每亩抛撒的谷子不到三斤。二队有些社员存在着“天一半，地一半”的思想，党支部也没及时向社员进行厉行节约的教育，以致在收割打场的时候，损失很大，每亩稻田平均抛撒三十多斤。找出原因以后，二队更进一步意识到思想工作的重要，继续发扬了他们的优点接受了教训，发动社员复打了没有打净的谷草，并给全部扮桶加了篷盖，防止抛撒，很快地赶上了第一小队。
    在对比现场会议中，各地干部通过对先进与落后的“现场”观摩、比较、分析，更清楚地看到了不同的收打措施和操作技术造成的显然不同的结果，对先进经验更加信服。有些地方开始没有认真地贯彻打谷扮桶加篷，组织儿童拣谷等措施，认为这些“无关紧要”。但通过对比现场会议，大家看到了实际效果，回去便积极采取措施。
    由于在收割工作各个环节上贯彻了精打细收的措施，全县已多收回稻谷近一千万斤。（附图片）
