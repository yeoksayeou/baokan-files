    Ode to the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
  　Xǔ Déhéng
    1.  Rejoicing in the tenth anniversary of National Day, a decade since the founding of the nation; hundreds of millions of people sing praises, boundless joy; a great decade, a myriad of new aspects; the people have stood up, society has been fundamentally transformed; brilliant and splendid, like the sun in the sky, great achievements and meritorious deeds, unprecedented in history.
    2.  Speaking of old China, poor and blank, the broad masses of the people, in deep water and scorching fire; imperialist powers, bullying and oppressing; warlords and bureaucrats, even greater scourges to the people; shackles upon shackles, unable to seek survival, past events vivid, how can we forget?
    3.  There is the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao, liberating the whole country, expelling the rebellious traitors. People's savior, invincible wherever it goes, five major movements, laying the foundation. Three major transformations, washing away old stains, scraping away dirt and polishing, recuperating and building strength.
    4.  Visionary and farsighted, the Sino-Soviet alliance; uniting and helping each other, one billion people; the Soviet Union as the head, with one heart and one mind, the socialist, strong camp, like the rising sun, like the rising moon, heads held high, leaping forward.
    5.  Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend, ten thousand streams forge ahead, all undertakings flourish. Dare to think, dare to act, changing daily and monthly, reversing decline and invigorating the waste, new events, new people. Establishing the weak, warning the stubborn, reforming faces and cleansing hearts, the Party's education, eternally evergreen!
    6.  Ideological reform, difficult to say, easy to do, listening to the Party's words, wholeheartedly. Six standards, the aim of words and deeds, good at learning, Marxism-Leninism. Mass line, the interests of the people, new every day, striving for self-improvement without ceasing.
    7.  Under the General Line, national construction, leaping development, system superiority. Creating seas and moving mountains, heroic spirit, frightening the enemy, losing their souls. Spreading rumors and slanders, reversing black and white, teachers by negative example, exhausting their minds and failing.
    8.  Go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, strive for the upstream, oppose rightward leaning. Five-year plan, completed in two years, people's commune, beautiful youth. Continue to leap forward, ten thousand horses and thousands of troops, increase production and practice economy, catch up with America and surpass England.
    9.  Great motherland, standing tall in the East, auspicious clouds in the sky, bright and glorious. Standing tall in the East, there is the Communist Party. Leading the whole country, thriving and prosperous, people praise the glory, the people's sun, praise Chairman Mao, boundless longevity!

    建国十周年颂
  　许德珩
    一欣逢十、一，建国十年；兆民歌颂，欢乐无边；伟大十年，气象万千；人民翻身，社会丕变；光辉灿烂，如日中天，伟绩丰功，史例无前。
    二曰旧中国，一穷二白，广大人民，水深火热；帝国主义，欺凌压迫；军阀官僚，更为民害；枷锁重重，求生不得，往事历历，岂能忘怀？
    三有共产党，和毛主席，解放全国，驱除贼逆。人民救星，所向无敌，五大运动，奠定始基。三大改造，旧染洗涤，刮垢磨光，休养生息。
    四高瞻远瞩，中苏同盟；团结互助，十亿人民；苏联为首，同德同心，社会主义，坚强阵营，如日之升，如月之恒，昂首阔步，飞跃前进。
    五百花齐放，百家争鸣，万流奋进，百废俱兴。敢想敢作，日异月新，起颓振废，新事新人。立懦警顽，革面洗心，党的教育，万古常青！
    六思想改造，说难也易，听党的话，全心全意。六项标准，言行鹄的，善于学习，马列主义。群众路线，人民利益，日新又新，自强不息。
    七总路线下，国家建设，飞跃发展，制度优越。造海移山，英雄气概，骇得敌人，丧魂落魄。造谣诬蔑，颠倒黑白，反面教员，心劳日拙。
    八鼓足干劲，多快好省，力争上游，反对右倾。五年计划，两年完成，人民公社，美妙青春。继续跃进，万马千军，增产节约，赶美超英。
    九伟大祖国，峙立东方，卿云在天，光华旦旦。峙立东方，有共产党。领导全国，蒸蒸日上，人颂光辉，人民太阳，颂毛主席，万寿无疆！
