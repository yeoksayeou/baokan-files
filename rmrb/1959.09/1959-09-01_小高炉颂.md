	Ode to Small Blast Furnaces
	A blast furnace is a flower
	Row upon row of small blast furnaces,
	Blossoming steel flowers,
	Although the flowers are small,
	Many flowers give off a great fragrance.
	The light of the Party shines upon them,
	They can withstand wind and rain;
	The water of the Great Leap Forward diligently irrigates them,
	The flowers bloom ever more magnificently.
	Row upon row of small blast furnaces, like waterfalls.
	Rushing up surging waves in people's hearts,
	Rushing so the enemy cannot sit still. Surging waves in people's hearts, giving us even greater strength; the enemy cannot sit still, bowing their heads to admit defeat.
	(Song Jialing)
	Steel Water Washes Away Ten Thousand Mountains
	A mountain of steel,
	A row of blast furnaces,
	A patch of flames,
	A sea of labor.
	The flaming spirit of iron smelting burns high into the clouds,
	Steel water washes away ten thousand mountains.
	(Fushun Yan Zixiang)
	Ode to Small Blast Furnaces
	Singing of small blast furnaces,
	Scattered like stars;
	Building tens of thousands every day,
	Never seen before in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad.
	Singing of small blast furnaces,
	Growing so majestic;
	Swallowing three mountains in one gulp,
	Holding five lakes within their belly.
	Singing of small blast furnaces,
	Rushing like waterfalls;
	A golden river falling from the sky,
	Molten iron flowing day and night.
	Singing of small blast furnaces,
	The enemy is dropping out of the ranks,
	One day equals twenty years,
	Even the sun and moon submit.
	(Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant Ma Zhanao)
	The Small Blast Furnace is Born Beautiful
	The small blast furnace is born beautiful,
	Its nostrils point to the sky, grinning wide.
	Smiling so that the high mountains offer their treasures,
	Smiling so that the molten iron leaps and dances.
	(Baotou Red Flag People's Commune Gao Shan)

    小高炉颂
    一座高炉一朵花
  座座小高炉，
  朵朵钢铁花，
  花儿虽然小，
  花多香味大。
  党的光芒照耀它，
  经得起风吹和雨打；
  跃进之水勤灌溉，
  花儿越开越壮大。
  座座小高炉，条条像瀑布。
  冲得人心激浪花，
  冲得敌人坐不住。人心激浪花，身上劲更足；敌人坐不住，低头来认输。
      （宋家玲）
    钢水冲跑万重山
  一片钢铁山，
  一片高炉排，
  一片烟火苗，
  一片劳动海。
  炼铁气焰高烧云，
  钢水冲跑万重山。
  （抚顺阎子祥）
  小高炉颂一唱小高炉，
  遍地星罗布；
  日建千万座，
  古今中外无。
  二唱小高炉，
  长的真威武；
  一口吞三山，
  腹内盛五湖。
  三唱小高炉，
  奔腾似瀑布；
  金河天上落，
  铁水日夜出。
  四唱小高炉，
  敌人落了伍，
  一天二十年，
  日月也服输。
      （沈阳重型机器厂马占鳌）
  小高炉生得俏
  小高炉，生得俏，
  鼻孔朝天咧嘴笑。
  笑得高山都献宝，
  笑得铁水翻花跳。
    （包头红旗人民公社高山）
