Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The National Committee of the China Association for Science and Technology and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology jointly held a symposium yesterday afternoon. The scientific and technological experts who attended warmly supported the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and expressed their firm response to the great call of the Party Central Committee to resolutely strive to achieve the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and science and technology. They also listed various facts about the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and science and technology and the superiority of the people's communes since last year, refuting the slanders of right-leaning opportunists against the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes.

The symposium was presided over by Li Siguang, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Association for Science and Technology, and Hou Debang, Vice Chairman. More than ninety people attended, including responsible persons of the National Committee of the China Association for Science and Technology, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology, and various specialized societies of natural sciences, as well as famous scientists.

Li Siguang first spoke on his own profession. He said that geological work has made a great leap forward since last year. Last year's mass movement to find and explore minerals discovered more than 160,000 mineral points, about 3.5 times that of the First Five-Year Plan. He said that some people believe that the working masses do not know minerals and cannot find and explore them. This is a manifestation of distrust in the working people. General preliminary mineral exploration does not necessarily require professionally trained personnel. The mass movement of mineral exploration and prospecting has made great contributions to the development of minerals and academic research.

Hou Debang introduced the current situation of continued leap forward in the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the enthusiasm of the staff in his speech. He said that the Ministry of Chemical Industry now works in three shifts a day, and there are people on duty 24 hours a day. If a phone call comes from a province or county, it can be connected immediately.

Fan Changjiang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Association for Science and Technology, said that scientific work has made great achievements last year, and the Association for Science and Technology has done a lot of useful work. He pointed out that right-leaning conservatism is currently a major obstacle in scientific and technological work and in the work of specialized natural science societies, and it must be resolutely opposed.

Wang Zhixi, Secretary-General of the Chinese Society for Metals, listed many advantages of small blast furnaces in his speech, refuting the slanders of right-leaning opportunists against small blast furnaces. He pointed out that in the past year, the total volume of small blast furnaces built in China was 43,000 cubic meters, which played a significant role in the development of China's iron and steel industry.

Bao Guobao, Executive Director of the Chinese Society of Electrical Engineering, said that in 1958, the achievements made in the power industry, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, and other electrical engineering-related undertakings, whether in production, capital construction, or scientific and technological development, far exceeded those of previous years. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, the power industry implemented the principle of "walking on two legs." In 1958, power generation increased by 42.5% compared with 1957, while the average annual growth rate between 1949 and 1958 was 22.9%. The increase in power generation equipment capacity in 1958 was 2.4 times that of 1957, approaching the power generation capacity installed in the sixty-eight years before liberation. Bao Guobao said that electrical engineering workers have the confidence and determination to catch up with the UK level in the production of various industries related to electrical engineering within ten years, and to realize the national twelve-year scientific research perspective plan ahead of schedule in the science and technology of electrical engineering.

Yang Xiandong, Chairman of the Temporary Working Committee of the Chinese Society of Agronomy, listed facts to illustrate the tremendous superiority of the people's communes in agricultural production and agricultural scientific research. Yang Xiandong also listed some of the achievements in agricultural science since the great leap forward last year, such as the experience of large-scale high-yield production, the creation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, the selection and breeding of many excellent varieties and hybrid varieties, the general survey and identification of soils, the production of various chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, antibiotics, and gibberellin, and the preliminary findings of prevention and control methods for difficult crop diseases such as wheat rust and potato late blight. Major achievements have been made in pesticides, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, especially in the preservation of cattle and sheep semen. Yang Xiandong emphasized that the communalization of the people's communes has created unparalleled and superior conditions for mass scientific experiments and research. After communalization, experimental fields and agricultural science research institutes are everywhere, and agricultural science is developing rapidly.

Zhang Hanying, Chairman of the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society, said that 1958 was a year of great leap forward in water conservancy construction and water conservancy science, which is beyond doubt. The achievements of water conservancy last year are inseparable from the movement of people's communes. Water conservancy itself is collective in nature, and the undertaking of water conservancy requires a large-scale organized collective force, which has promoted the development of the people's commune movement. At the same time, water conservancy only has the conditions and foundation for more rapid development after the communalization of the people's communes.

Han Yongle, a member of the Beijing Crop Society and a member of the Nanyuan People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, introduced the continued great leap forward of their commune this year: From January to July this year, 51.43 million catties of vegetables were marketed, an increase of 9.75 million catties over the same period last year. The planting area of summer vegetables was 5,000 mu, which also overfulfilled the task. The average yield per mu of wheat has increased significantly. From January to July, the total income of the commune was 3.45 million yuan, an increase of 1.27 million yuan over the same period last year. Production technology has been greatly improved, and the scale of production has gradually expanded. The farmland of the entire commune has basically realized water conservancy, semi-mechanization of farming, electrification of water lifting tools, and bearingization of transportation vehicles. He said that the achievements are mainly attributed to the leadership of the Party and the superiority of the people's communes, and also to the result of the hard work of all the members and cadres day and night.

Wu Huaqing, Wang Mingzhi, Chen Shixiang, Li Kezuo, Fu Lianzhang, Huang Ziqing and many other scientific experts also spoke at the meeting. Due to time constraints, many famous scientists such as Zhu Kezhen, Mao Yisheng, Ding Ying, Yan Jici, Zhou Peiyuan, and Qin Renchang submitted written speeches.

    科学技术专家座谈八中全会公报和决议
    总路线战无不胜
    列举大量事实驳斥右倾机会主义分子的污蔑
    据新华社31日讯　中国科学技术协会全国委员会和北京市科学技术协会筹委会30日下午联合举行座谈会。到会的科学技术专家们热烈拥护党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，表示坚决响应党中央的伟大号召，坚决为实现工农业生产和科学技术的继续跃进而奋斗。他们还列举去年以来工农业生产、科学技术大跃进和人民公社优越性的种种事实，驳斥了右倾机会主义分子对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的污蔑。
    座谈会由中国科协全国委员会主席李四光、副主席侯德榜主持。出席的有科协全国委员会、北京市科协筹委会以及各自然科学专门学会的负责人、著名科学家等共九十多人。
    李四光首先就他自己的专业发言。他说，去年以来地质工作有了很大的跃进。去年群众性的找矿探矿运动，发现了十六万多个矿点，约为第一个五年计划的三点五倍。他说，有些人认为劳动群众不知道矿，不能找矿探矿，这是不信任劳动人民的表现，一般初步的找矿工作，并不一定需要受过长期训练的专业人员去作，群众性的找矿探矿对开发矿产和学术研究都有很大贡献。
    侯德榜在发言中介绍了化工部目前继续跃进的情况和工作人员的干劲。他说，现在化工部一天分三班工作，二十四小时内都有人，省里、县里如果来了电话，马上可以取得连系。
    中国科协全国委员会副主席范长江说，去年科学工作有很大成绩，科学技术协会作了很多有益的工作。他指出目前右倾保守在科学技术工作中和自然科学专门学会工作中是一大障碍，必须坚决反掉。
    中国金属学会秘书长王之玺在发言中列举了小高炉的许多优点，驳斥了右倾机会主义分子对小高炉的诬蔑。他指出，去年一年中，我国建设的小高炉总容积有四万三千立方米，对我国钢铁工业的发展起了重大的作用。
    中国电机工程学会常务理事鲍国宝说，1958年内，电力工业、电机制造工业及其他有关电机工程的事业，无论在生产、基建、科学技术发展各方面所取得的成就都远远超过了往年。电力工业在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻了“两条腿走路”的方针，1958年的发电量比1957年增长了42.5％，而1949至1958年之间平均每年增长速度则为22.9％。1958年发电设备容量的增加为1957年的二点四倍，接近解放前六十八年所装置的发电容量。鲍国宝说，电机工程工作者有信心和决心在十年内在有关电机工程各工业的生产方面赶上英国水平，并在电机工程的科学技术方面提前实现国家十二年科学研究远景规划。
    中国农学会临时工作委员会主任委员杨显东列举事实说明了人民公社在农业生产和农业科学研究中发挥的巨大优越性。杨显东在会上又列举了去年大跃进以来农业科学上的一些成就，例如大面积丰产的经验，农业八字宪法的创造，许多优良品种和杂交品种的选育、土壤的普查鉴定，制成了多种化肥、细菌肥料、抗生素和赤霉素，对小麦锈病和马铃薯晚疫病等疑难的作物病害初步找到了防治方法，在农药、畜牧兽医、特别是牛羊精液的保存等方面，都获得了重大成就。杨显东强调指出人民公社化为群众性的科学试验研究创造了无比优越的条件，公社化以后，试验田和农业科学研究所到处皆是，农业科学正在一日千里地发展着。
    中国水利学会理事长张含英说，1958年是水利建设事业和水利科学大跃进的一年，这是丝毫不容置疑的。去年水利事业的成就，是与人民公社化运动分不开的。水利事业本身是集体性质的，而兴办水利，又要求有大规模的有组织的集体力量，这就促进了人民公社运动的发展，同时，水利事业也只有在人民公社化以后，才具有更加迅速发展的条件和基础。
    北京市作物学会理事、京郊南苑人民公社社员韩永乐介绍了他们公社今年继续大跃进的情况：今年1月到7月，上市蔬菜五千一百四十三万斤，比去年同期增加了九百七十五万斤，夏季蔬菜的种植面积五千亩，也超额完成了任务。小麦平均每亩产量有很大增长。1月到7月份全社共收入三百四十五万元，比去年同期增加一百二十七万元。生产技术有很大改进，生产规模逐步扩大，全社农田已基本实现了水利化、耕种半机械化、提水工具电气化和运输车辆轴承化。他说，这些成绩的取得，首先要归功于党的领导和人民公社的优越性，同时也是全体社员和干部鼓足干劲日夜奋战的结果。
    在会上发言的还有吴华庆、王明之、陈世骧、李克佐、傅连暲、黄子卿等许多科学专家。由于时间的限制，竺可桢、茅以升、丁颖、严济慈、周培源、秦仁昌等许多著名科学家提出了书面发言。
