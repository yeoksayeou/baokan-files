    新华社14日讯　第一届全国运动会足球第二段决赛今天继续举行了四场比赛。结果辽宁队以三比一胜陕西队，吉林队与湖北队一比一踢成平局，四川队以一比零胜江苏队，黑龙江队以二比一胜上海队。
    今天的四场比赛战斗都相当激烈，在天津参加预赛时，黑龙江队曾以零比一输给上海队。今天，在北京体育馆的足球场上，这两个队再度相逢。年轻的黑龙江足球队，一开始就发动了猛烈的攻势，攻入对方禁区，上半时获得七次射门机会，攻进了二球。上海队上半时射门五次，没有建树。下半时上海队调整阵容，组织反攻，五次射门，但因对方防守严密，都没有得分。黑龙江队射门四次，也未获战果。直到比赛结束前五分钟，因黑龙江队队员犯规，上海队获得罚任意球的机会得分，这场球赛才以二比一终场。黑龙江队今天始终干劲充沛，勇猛顽强，前锋后卫配合良好，踢得相当出色，获得观众普遍赞扬。
    17日，参加全运会足球第二段决赛的十二个劲旅将全部上阵，继续展开激战。
