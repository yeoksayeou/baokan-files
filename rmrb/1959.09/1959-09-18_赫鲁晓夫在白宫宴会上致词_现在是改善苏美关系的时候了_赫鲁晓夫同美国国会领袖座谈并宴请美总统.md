Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington via TASS: On September 15th, a ceremony for presenting souvenirs to US President Eisenhower was held at the White House – the official residence of the US President in Washington. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, presented President Eisenhower with a replica of the marker sent to the moon by rocket on September 12, 1959, and a gold commemorative medal marking the successful launch of the lunar rocket. The gift was accompanied by a letter to the President, which stated:

"To Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States:

I have the honor to present to you, Mr. President, a replica of the marker carried to the moon by the rocket-launched container on September 12, 1959, as a token of my deep respect for you.

The container reached the moon at 00:02:24 Moscow time on September 14, 1959.

The original marker is on the moon.

Please regard this gift as a symbol of the dedication of my country's people to developing peaceful and friendly relations with the people of your country, with your great nation – the United States of America.

With deepest respect,
        N.S. Khrushchev
        Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR
        September 15, 1959"

The inscription on the marker presented to the US President read:

"To the President of the United States of America, Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower.
From N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."

Upon receiving the commemorative gifts, the US President expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet government and said that the replica of the marker and the medal would be placed in a museum.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: US President Eisenhower hosted a banquet at the White House on the evening of the 15th to entertain Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev. The US President and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR exchanged toasts at the banquet.

In his toast, Eisenhower recounted the history of US-Soviet relations and said, "We were allies in two world wars, and now, I feel, our two countries bear a special responsibility to the world. Considering our power and our influence on the world, it is extremely important that we have a better understanding of each other. I agree with you on this point. I believe it is not enough to be good at arguing now. We should rely on facts and truth. I think we should make it our common goal to understand facts and truth as much as possible.”

In his reply, Khrushchev said, "We firmly believe that our countries and peoples can live together in friendship and jointly struggle for the consolidation of peace."

Khrushchev said, "We believe our social system is better than yours. You think your system is better than ours. So what do we do? Do we lead the dispute over whose system is better to war between the two countries? Isn't it better to let history solve this problem? I think it is more correct to do so. If you agree to do so, then we can build our relations on the basis of peace and friendship."

Khrushchev said, "The time has come to consider and make every effort to improve relations between our two countries. We don't want anything from you, and you don't need anything from us. Admittedly, you are richer than us now, but tomorrow we will be just as rich as you, and the day after tomorrow even richer than you" (lively applause in the hall). "But what's wrong with that? After all, we hope to earn all this through our own labor, not by plundering wealth from anyone. It should be said that I am very pleased with today's meeting and the exchange of views with the President. I think there is a good start. May the results be even better."

The banquet proceeded in a warm atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: After attending a banquet at the US National Press Club on the 16th, Khrushchev, accompanied by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lodge, traveled by car to tour various parts of Washington. When Khrushchev visited the Lincoln Memorial, a large crowd of citizens gathered there and applauded him.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch, September 17th: TASS Moscow, September 17th dispatch: The Soviet "Pravda" today published a report from its special correspondent in Washington on Khrushchev's visit to the US Department of Agriculture's scientific experiment station.

The report said that Khrushchev, accompanied by US President's representative Lodge and other officials, visited the Department of Agriculture's scientific experiment station in Beltsville (Maryland) on September 16th.

The Beltsville Institute is a large scientific institution with 2,300 scientific workers and a good experimental base.

Khrushchev was greeted in Beltsville by US Secretary of Agriculture Benson. Benson and some American scientific workers introduced the guests to the scientific work being carried out by the United States in agriculture.

Khrushchev walked toward the turkey raising area. An American reporter asked, "Does the Soviet Union have a communist method of raising turkeys?"

Khrushchev replied to the laughter of those present, "If you don't put labels on the turkeys, you can't tell whether they are capitalist or communist. No chemical analysis will show any difference between the meat of a communist turkey and a capitalist turkey. You can see that in this regard, we have no contradictions. The more turkeys there are, the better the people's lives will be, whether the people of socialist countries or the people of capitalist countries."

Khrushchev warmly bid farewell to the scientists, thanked them for their kindness, and hoped that they would achieve success in this important and beneficial cause. Many residents of Beltsville warmly saw Khrushchev off.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, visited the US Congress on the afternoon of the 16th at the invitation of US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright, and held discussions with Congressional leaders and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

After the discussions, Comrade Khrushchev made a statement to the press.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the evening of September 16th, Khrushchev hosted a banquet at the Soviet Embassy in Washington to entertain US President Eisenhower and his wife. (Attached picture)

    赫鲁晓夫在白宫宴会上致词
    现在是改善苏美关系的时候了
    赫鲁晓夫同美国国会领袖座谈并宴请美总统
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：9月15日在白宫——美国总统在华盛顿的官邸——举行了向美国总统艾森豪威尔赠送纪念品的仪式。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫把1959年9月12日用火箭载往月球的标记的复制品和一枚纪念月球火箭发射成功的金质纪念章送给美国总统艾森豪威尔。同礼物一起送给总统的还有一封信，信中说：
    “美国总统德怀特·艾森豪威尔先生：
    我荣幸地把1959年9月12日由发射的火箭的容器载往月球的标记的复制品送给您，总统先生，以表示我对您的深切敬意。
    容器是在1959年9月14日莫斯科时间零时零二分二十四秒到达月球的。
    标记的原件正在月球上。
    请把这件礼物看作是我国人民致力于同贵国人民，同你们伟大的国家——美利坚合众国发展和平友好关系的象征。
    深致敬意
        苏联部长会议主席尼·
            谢·赫鲁晓夫
            1959年9月15日”
    在送给美国总统的标记上刻着这样的字：
    “美利坚合众国总统德怀特·艾森豪威尔先生
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫赠”
    美国总统在接受纪念礼品的时候对苏联政府表示深深感谢，并说将把标记的复制品和纪念章交博物馆保存。
    据新华社讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔15日晚间在白宫设宴招待苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。美国总统和苏联部长会议主席在宴会上相互致词。
    艾森豪威尔在致词中追述了美苏两国关系的历史，他并且说，在两次世界大战中，我们曾是盟国，现在，我觉得，我们两国对全世界负有特别的责任。考虑到我们的威力，我们对于全世界的影响，我们相互之间更好地了解是极其重要的。关于这一点我和你是一致的。我认为，现在只善于争论是不够的。我们应该依赖事实和真相。我认为，我们应该把尽量互相了解事实和真相当作我们共同的目标。
    赫鲁晓夫在答词中说，我们深信，我们的国家和人民能够友好相处，共同为巩固和平而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为我们的社会制度比你们的好。你们认为你们的制度比我们的好。那我们怎么办呢？把谁的制度好的争执引向两国打仗吗？让历史来解决这个问题不是更好些吗？我想，这样做是比较正确的。如果你们同意这样做，那么，我们可以把我们的关系建立在和平和友好的基础上。
    赫鲁晓夫说，目前是考虑并且尽一切努力改善我们两国关系的时候了。我们不要你们的任何东西，你们也不需要我们的什么东西。诚然，目前你们还比我们富有，但是明天我们要和你们同样富有，后天比你们更富有（场内活跃）。但是，这有什么不好呢？归根到底我们希望用自己的劳动赢得这一切而不是向任何人掠夺财富。应当说，我们今天的会见和同总统的交换意见使我很高兴。我认为有了良好的开端。但愿结果会更好。
    宴会在热烈的气氛中进行。
    据新华社讯　赫鲁晓夫16日在美国全国新闻俱乐部参加宴会以后，在苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯和美国常驻联合国代表洛奇陪同下乘汽车到华盛顿市内各处观光。当赫鲁晓夫参观林肯墓的时候，有一大群聚集在那里的市民向他鼓掌欢迎。
    据新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联“真理报”今天发表了它的特派记者从华盛顿发来的关于赫鲁晓夫访问美国农业部科学试验站的报道。
    报道中说，赫鲁晓夫9月16日在美国总统的代表洛奇和其他官员的陪同下前往贝兹维尔（马里兰州）的农业部科学试验站。
    贝兹维尔研究所是一个大型的科学机构，研究所有二千三百名科学工作者，有良好的试验基地。
    在贝兹维尔迎接赫鲁晓夫的是美国农业部长本逊。本逊和一些美国科学工作人员向客人介绍了美国在农业方面所进行的科学工作。
    赫鲁晓夫走向养火鸡的场地。一个美国记者问道：“苏联是否有养火鸡的共产主义方法”。
    赫鲁晓夫在在场的人们的笑声中回答说：“如果不给火鸡贴上标签，那就无法区别它是资本主义的还是共产主义的。任何化学分析都不会表明共产主义火鸡和资本主义火鸡的肉有什么区别。你们可以看得出来，在这方面，我们是没有矛盾的。火鸡越多，人民的生活就会越好，无论是社会主义国家的人民还是资本主义国家的人民。”
    赫鲁晓夫热情地同科学家们告别，感谢他们对他的厚意，并希望他们在这项重要而有益的事业中取得成就。贝兹维尔许多居民热烈地送别赫鲁晓夫。
    据新华社讯　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫16日下午应美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特的邀请访问了美国国会，并且同国会领袖和参议院外交委员会的委员们进行了座谈。
    座谈之后，赫鲁晓夫同志对报界发表了谈话。
