Xinhua News Agency, 26th: With the founding of New China, and with the completion of the land reform, the development of agricultural cooperation and people's commune movements, China's grain production is heading straight for its peak at an unprecedented rate. From 216.2 billion jin at the time of the founding of the country in 1949, it leaped to 500 billion jin in 1958. In just nine years, it increased by 1.3 times! The 1962 grain production target set by the state's Second Five-Year Plan has been achieved ahead of schedule.

The average annual increase rate of grain in China in the past nine years is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. From 1949 to 1958, the average annual increase rate of grain in China was 9.8%. The United States was 2.5%, France was 3.2%, Japan was 2.2%, and the United Kingdom could not even talk about "increase" at all. The growth rate of grain production per unit area in China has also overwhelmed all capitalist countries. In 1958, the average yield per mu of grain crops in the country increased by 93.7% compared with 1949, with an average annual increase rate of 7.6%. The total increase in grain yield per unit area in China in the past nine years is almost one and a half times higher than that of the United States, more than three times that of Japan, more than two times that of France, and more than seventeen times that of the United Kingdom. These facts eloquently illustrate that the growth rate of grain in China has left all capitalist countries far behind, vividly demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the grain production in China has gradually changed its previous development pattern. Many of the original low-yield areas have become high-yield areas, and many of the grain-deficient areas have become surplus-grain areas. Henan, Guangdong, Guizhou, Fujian and other provinces, which have historically been short of grain, have become surplus-grain provinces one after another. Before liberation, Guizhou Province was a well-known place with poor people, barren land, high mountains, and little farmland, and it could not produce enough grain every year. After liberation, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party, the broad masses of people showed their style of being poor but ambitious, quickly changed the backward farming methods, and grain production increased greatly. In 1955, grain not only reached self-sufficiency, but also had surplus grain for export.

The output of the original grain-producing areas has also increased. The Sichuan Basin has achieved bumper harvests for nine consecutive years. Most of the Huai River Basin has become a grain-producing area with two harvests of rice and wheat per year in China. The Suzhou area in the Yangtze River Delta and the Shantou area in the Han River Delta have become well-known high-yield areas in the country.

In the past ten years, large areas of wasteland have been turned over and become new grain production bases. From "Beidahuang" to Hainan Island, from Xinjiang to Yunnan, many large farms have been born on the primitive wilderness where no one has lived for thousands of years.

China is a world-famous country for rice and wheat production. The history of rice cultivation is the longest. However, before liberation, the planting area continued to decrease. By 1949, the national rice planting area had shrunk to more than 380 million mu. After liberation, with the great leap forward in water conservancy and irrigation, the rice planting area expanded rapidly. By 1958, the national rice planting area reached more than 490 million mu. The leap in wheat production was also very large. The total wheat output in 1958 increased by more than 100% compared with 1949. Traditionally, southern China is a rice-producing area and northern China is a wheat-producing area. It is said that this is determined by climatic conditions such as rainfall. However, in the past ten years, rice has moved north and wheat has moved south, and the planting areas of rice and wheat have been greatly expanded. Now rice has developed all the way to the banks of the Heilongjiang River at 52 degrees north latitude and the Pamir Plateau on the roof of the world. At the same time, wheat cultivation has developed southward to the Honghe River Basin in subtropical Yunnan Province.

On the road of the Great Leap Forward in China's grain production, low yield has become high yield, and disaster years have become bumper years. Wheat has always been considered a low-yield crop. This year, according to statistics from the four provinces of Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu, there are 650,000 mu of wheat with a yield of up to 500 jin per mu, not to mention the high-yield experimental fields with more than 1,000 jin. In the past ten years, some areas of China have suffered natural disasters of varying degrees every year. Among them, 1954, 1956, and this year can be regarded as major disaster years compared with disaster years in Chinese history. Even in these major disaster years, China's grain production has also increased upward. This year, the drought was particularly severe, and the output of summer grain in China increased by another 2.5 billion jin compared with last year's Great Leap Forward.

Since the founding of New China, 650 million Chinese people have relied on the development of their own grain production and no longer import grain. The people of the whole country, especially the working people, eat better and better than in the past. Every year, we also export some of the surplus grain to provide the foreign exchange needed for the country's socialist construction.

"Of all the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first; of all the thousands of plans, the mass line is the first." This is the source of power for the high-speed development of grain production in China. Under the wise leadership of the Party, hundreds of millions of working people, with the great wisdom and courage to reverse the world, have changed the history of grain development in China. In just ten years, the amount of grain increase in New China has surpassed that of the old China in thousands of years.

Now, the people's communes across the country are responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting their energy, launching a vigorous overproduction campaign, and fighting with full confidence to achieve the glorious task of increasing grain production by 10% over last year.

The average annual increase of total cotton output in the country is 18.8%, and the unit area yield is increasing by 9.5%. This growth rate has greatly exceeded that of the United States, which has always been known as "the world's number one cotton producer."

Xinhua News Agency, 25th: China's cotton production has achieved unprecedented great achievements in the past ten years. In 1952, the last year of the three-year period of national economic recovery, the national cotton output reached 26.07 million dan, an increase of 53.6% compared with 1936, the year with the highest pre-war output. By 1958, the national cotton output had leaped to 42 million dan, equivalent to 4.7 times that of the early days of liberation in 1949. The rapid development of cotton production in the country has fundamentally changed the situation in which China mainly relied on importing foreign cotton to solve the needs of the people and the textile industry during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, greatly promoted the development of China's textile industry, and solved the needs of the Chinese people for clothing and cotton.

China is a country with a history of cotton planting for more than 1,300 years, with very vast cotton-growing land, and the vast number of farmers have also accumulated rich cotton-planting experience in the long-term production struggle. However, in the old China under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang before liberation, cotton farmers suffered from the exploitation and plunder of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Cotton production has not been developed. By the eve of the national liberation, China's cotton production was already in a dilapidated situation. The total cotton output in 1948 was still at the production level of 1919, thirty years ago.

After liberation, the Party and the government adopted various measures to actively develop cotton production while developing grain production. During the period of national economic recovery from 1950 to 1952, the national cotton planting area increased by more than 100%, and the unit area yield increased by 44.4%, so that the total cotton output in 1952 increased by 1.9 times compared with 1949; during the first five-year plan, although the national cotton field planting area did not increase much, due to the increase in unit yield, by 1957, the total cotton output had increased by 26% compared with 1952. In 1958, cotton production achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. In this year, the average unit area yield of cotton in the country increased by 29% compared with 1957, so that the total output increased to 42 million dan, an increase of 28% compared with 1957. The growth rate in one year was equivalent to the growth rate of the first five-year plan.

The rapid development of cotton production in China since liberation fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. In the past nine years, the average annual increase of total cotton output in the country has been 18.8%, and the average annual increase of unit area yield has been 9.5%. This growth rate has greatly exceeded that of the United States, which has always been known as "the world's number one cotton producer." The cotton output in the United States increased from 8.44 million dan in 1866 to 43.44 million dan in 1894, a total of 28 years, with an average annual increase of only 6%. In the past nine years, the cotton production in the United States has been declining. The total cotton output in 1958 decreased by 28.1% compared with 1949.

In the past ten years, the quality of cotton in China has also been continuously improved. Due to the popularization of improved varieties, the average fiber length of cotton in the country has increased from 21.96 mm in 1950 (the average of all commercial cotton purchased by the state) to about 27.5 mm in 1958.

The huge increase in cotton production since liberation has provided sufficient raw cotton for the textile industry. Due to the development of cotton production and the textile industry, the clothing level of the Chinese people has been significantly improved. In 1959, the average per capita consumption of cotton cloth in the country increased by more than 100% compared with 1949.

In the development of cotton production, the vast number of cotton farmers in the country, with the care and support of the Party and the government, actively reformed farming techniques, adopted advanced production experience, and carried out large-scale farmland capital construction.

This year, the people's communes in cotton-growing areas have universally implemented the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and have also opened up many large-scale high-yield cotton fields. Cotton production is bound to exceed the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

    我国粮棉生产比翼高飞
    九年粮食增长一点三倍，棉花增长三点七倍
    第二个五年计划规定的1962年的粮食生产指标已经提前实现。我国粮食增长的速度，把一切资本主义国家远远抛在后头。
    据新华社26日讯　新中国一成立，随着土地改革的完成，农业合作化和人民公社化运动的发展，我国的粮食生产，以空前未有的速度，直奔高峰。从1949年开国时候的二千一百六十二亿斤，到1958年，便跃进到五千亿斤。短短九年，增长了一点三倍！实现了国家第二个五年计划所规定的1962年的粮食生产指标。
    九年来我国粮食的平均递增率是资本主义国家望尘莫及的。从1949到1958的九年中，我国粮食每年平均递增率是9.8％。而美国是2.5％，法国是3.2％，日本是2.2％，英国则根本谈不上什么“递增”了。我国粮食生产单位面积产量的增长速度，也压倒了一切资本主义国家。1958年全国粮食作物的平均亩产量，比1949年提高了93.7％，平均每年递增率达到7.6％。我国九年来粮食单位面积产量的总增长幅度，比美国将近高一倍半，比日本多三倍以上，比法国大两倍多，超过英国十七倍多。这些事实，雄辩地说明，我国粮食的增长速度，已把一切资本主义国家远远地抛在后面，生动地显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    建国以来，我国的粮食生产逐步改变了以往的发展规律。原来的低产区很多已经变成高产区，缺粮区很多已经变成余粮区。历史上一向缺粮的河南、广东、贵州、福建等省，都已经先后成为余粮省。贵州省解放前，是有名的人穷、地瘦、山高、田少的地方，年年粮食不能自给。解放后，在党的领导和鼓舞下，广大群众表现出人穷志气高的风格，很快地改变了落后的耕种方法，粮食产量大增，在1955年粮食不仅达到自给自足，还有余粮外运。
    原来的产粮区产量也有提高。四川盆地已经连续九年获得了大丰收。淮河流域大部分已成为我国稻麦两熟的产粮区。长江三角洲的苏州地区和韩江三角洲的汕头地区，已成为全国有名的高产区。
    十年来，有大片荒地翻了身，成为新的粮食生产基地。从“北大荒”到海南岛，从新疆到云南，几千年来没有人烟的原始荒原上，如今诞生了许多大农场。
    我国是世界上著名的稻麦产国。种植水稻的历史最久。但是解放前种植面积不断减少，到1949年，全国水稻种植面积已缩小到三亿八千多万亩。解放后，随着水利灌溉事业的大跃进，水稻种植面积迅速扩大，到1958年，全国稻谷种植面达到四点九亿多亩。小麦的产量跃进幅度也很大，1958年小麦总产量比1949年增长一倍以上。我国农业传统上南方是水稻产区而北方是小麦产区。据说这是雨量等气候条件决定的。但是，十年来，水稻北上，小麦南下，稻、麦种植区都大大地扩展了。现在水稻一直发展到北纬五十二度的黑龙江畔和世界屋顶的帕米尔高原。同时，小麦的种植向南发展到了亚热带云南省的红河流域。
    我国粮食生产，在大跃进的道路上，低产变成高产，灾年变成丰年。小麦，向来被人们认为是低产作物。今年，据陕西、河北、河南、江苏四省统计，就有六十五万亩小麦亩产高达五百斤，更不要说哪些千斤以上的高额丰产试验田了。十年来，我国每年都有部分地区遭受程度不同的自然灾害，其中1954、1956年和今年，同我国历史上的灾年相比，都够得上是大灾年。就在这些大灾年，我国粮食生产也是向上增长的。今年旱灾特重，我国夏收粮食的产量比去年大跃进又增加了二十五亿斤。
    新中国成立以来，六亿五千万中国人依靠自己粮食生产的发展，不再进口粮食。全国人民，特别是劳动人民，却比过去吃得饱，吃得好。每年，我们还把节余的一部分粮食出口，为国家提供社会主义建设所需要的外汇。
    “千条万条，党的领导第一条；千计万计，群众路线第一计。”这是我国粮食生产高速度发展的动力泉源。在党的英明领导下，亿万劳动人民，以敢于扭转乾坤的大智大勇，改变了我国粮食的发展历史，在短短的十年间，新中国粮食的增长数量，就胜过了旧中国的几千年。
    现在，全国人民公社响应党的八中全会号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，展开了轰轰烈烈的超产运动，满怀信心为实现粮食生产比去年增产10％的光荣任务而斗争。
    全国棉花总产量平均每年递增18.8％，单位面积产量递增9.5％，这个增长速度大大超过了一向号称“世界产棉第一位”的美国
    据新华社25日讯　我国的棉花生产，十年来得到了空前巨大的成就。在三年国民经济恢复时期的最末一年——1952年，全国的棉花产量就达到二千六百零七万担，比战前年产量最高的1936年增加了53.6％。到1958年，全国棉花又跃增到四千二百万担，相当于解放初期1949年的四点七倍。全国棉花生产的飞跃发展，从根本上改变了我国在国民党反动统治时期主要依靠进口外棉解决人民和纺织工业用棉的情况，大大促进了我国纺织工业的发展，解决了我国人民衣着和用棉的需要。
    我国是有一千三百多年植棉历史的国家，有非常广阔的宜棉土地，广大农民在长期的生产斗争中也积累了丰富的植棉经验。但是，在解放以前国民党反动统治的旧中国，棉农长期遭受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的剥削、掠夺，棉花生产一直得不到发展，到全国解放前夕，我国棉花生产已经处于残破不堪的局面。1948年的棉花总产量仍然在三十年前的1919年的生产水平。 
    解放以后，党和政府采取各种措施，在发展粮食生产的同时，积极发展棉花生产。在1950年到1952年的国民经济恢复时期，全国植棉面积增加了一倍多，单位面积产量增加44.4％，因而使1952年的棉花总产量比1949年增加了一点九倍；在第一个五年计划期间，虽然全国棉田的种植面积没有增加多少，但由于单位产量的提高，到1957年，棉花的总产量已比1952年提高了26％。而在1958年，棉花生产更得到了史无前例的大跃进。这一年，全国棉花的平均单位面积产量比1957年提高了29％，从而使总产量增长到四千二百万担，比1957年增加了28％，一年间的增长速度，相当于第一个五年计划的增长速度。
    我国解放以来棉花生产的迅速发展，充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。在九年中，全国棉花总产量平均每年递增18.8％，单位面积产量平均每年递增9.5％。这个增长速度已经大大超过了一向号称“世界产棉第一位”的美国。美国的棉花产量从1866年八百四十四万担增到1894年的四千三百四十四万担，共用了二十八年，平均每年只递增6％。近九年来美国的棉花生产更是每况愈下，1958年的棉花总产量比1949年还下降了28.1％。
    十年来，我国棉花的品质也在不断提高。由于良种的普及，全国棉花平均纤维的长度已由1950年的二十一点九六毫米（国家收购的全部商品棉的平均）增加到1958年的二十七点五毫米左右。
    解放以后棉花生产的巨大增长，为纺织工业提供了充足的原棉。由于棉花生产和纺织工业的发展，使我国人民的衣着水平得到了显著提高，1959年全国每人平均棉布消费量比1949年增加了一倍多。
    在发展棉花生产中，全国广大棉农在党与政府的关怀和扶持下积极改革耕作技术，采用先进的生产经验和进行大规模的农田基本建设。
    今年，棉区人民公社普遍贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，同时还开辟了许多大面积丰产棉田，棉花生产势将超过大跃进的1958年。
