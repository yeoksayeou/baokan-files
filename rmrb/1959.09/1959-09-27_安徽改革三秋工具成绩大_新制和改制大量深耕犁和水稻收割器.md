Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: An Anhui Province-wide tool reform movement centered on autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing is in full swing. After studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the broad masses of cadres and commune members have greater enthusiasm and confidence, and have rapidly launched a high tide of tool reform for the "Three Autumns." According to statistics as of September 14, the province has newly manufactured and modified 446,000 various deep plowing plows, 136,000 improved harrows, 146,000 close planting drills, and 37,000 rapid rice harvesters, and has also added more than 60 million sickles and other harvesting tools.

To ensure a bumper summer harvest next year, the Provincial Party Committee specifically convened an autumn planting meeting in mid-August to conduct a detailed discussion and arrangement of the preparation of tools for the "Three Autumns". Each Special Zone and city also separately convened on-the-spot meetings for "Three Autumns" tools. At the on-the-spot meeting of the "Three Autumns" tools convened in the Bengbu Special Zone, in addition to evaluating advanced tools such as slide rope traction machines, deep plowing plows, and rapid rice harvesters and requiring their promotion, it also focused on criticizing the right-leaning emotions and conservative thinking of some people, promoting the work of tool reform.

Now, agricultural tool factories and machinery factories in counties and communes throughout Anhui Province are concentrating a large number of iron and wood workers to rush to manufacture and modify tools for the "Three Autumns". In the Wuhu Special Zone, 11,320 iron and wood workers are specializing in "Three Autumns" tools. Shucheng County adopted methods such as clearing warehouses, utilizing substitutes, and mutual adjustment between communes and teams to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Fengyang, Fanchang and other counties have held short-term technical training classes to improve the manufacturing skills of iron and wood workers and the technical level of commune members in using the tools.

In the tool reform, new creations continue to emerge in various places. For example, the counties in the Bengbu Special Zone create an average of 71 new tools per week. Workers at the Dongfeng Machinery Factory in the suburbs of Bengbu City successfully trial-produced an electric plow, and continued to work hard for three days to transform a diesel engine into a power traction machine.

    安徽改革三秋工具成绩大
    新制和改制大量深耕犁和水稻收割器
    据新华社合肥电　一个以秋收、秋种、秋耕为中心的工具改革运动正在安徽省全面展开。广大干部和社员学习了八中全会文件后，干劲更大，信心更足，迅速地掀起了三秋工具改革高潮。截至9月14日统计，全省已新制和改制各种深耕犁四十四万六千部、改良耙十三万六千部、密植耧十四万六千部、水稻快速收割器三万七千部，还添制镰刀等收割工具六千多万把。
    为保证明年夏季大丰收，8月中旬省委曾专门召开了秋种会议，对三秋工具的准备，也进行了详细的讨论和布置。各专区、市也都分别召开了三秋工具现场会。蚌埠专区在召开的三秋工具现场会上，除评出滑道绳牵引机、深耕犁、水稻快速收割器等先进工具，要求推广外，还着重批判了某些人的右倾情绪和保守思想，推动了工具改革工作。
    现在，安徽省各县、社农具厂、机械厂都集中大批铁、木工突击制造和改制三秋工具。芜湖专区已有一万一千三百二十个铁木工专搞三秋工具。舒城县采取清理仓库、利用代用品、社、队相互调剂等办法，解决了原料不足的困难。凤阳、凡昌等县举办了短期技术训练班，提高铁木工的制造技术和社员的使用技术水平。
    各地在工具改革中，新的创造不断出现。如蚌埠专区各县平均每星期就创造新工具七十一件。蚌埠市郊区东风机械厂职工试制成功了电犁，又继续苦战三天，将柴油机改造成为动力牵引机。
