Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th. According to the first issue of "Lao Patriotic News" published on September 8th, the people of Phongsaly, Laos, recently used machetes, wooden sticks, landmines, traps, and other means to victoriously resist the "sweeping" operations of the Phoui Sananikone government army. The people's armed forces forced the government army to withdraw from four locations: So Nao, Hui Gang, Hui Lei, and Hui Hun. Part of the Nam Nga district has also been freed from the occupation and suppression by the Phoui Sananikone government army.

On August 30th, when part of the Royal Army from the Muang Kho outpost went out on a "sweeping" operation, the local people forced the remaining troops to withdraw from Muang Kho.

The Phoui Sananikone government army was also forced to withdraw from Muang Bai, Sa Thong, So Ping, Bon Tou, Muang Na, and other places in Sam Neua Province in early August. On August 30th and 31st, under the pressure of the people of Khouengkhouang district, the Phoui Sananikone government army was forced to withdraw from Khouengkhouang and Muang He. The Royal Army stationed along the Ma River also fled.

Thus, most of Muang Son district, part of He Muang district, and more than half of Khouengkhouang district in Sam Neua Province are now free of Sananikone government troops.

In Luang Prabang, the Royal Army was forced to withdraw from the So Sang area on August 14th. The local people have repeatedly repelled the "sweeping" operations of the Royal Army in Ban Cha, Muang Wei, and Muang Hiem.

In many places in the northern provinces of Laos, people held rallies and passed proposals demanding that the Royal Government stop the civil war, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, and restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos.

The officers and soldiers of the Royal Army are also increasingly opposed to the civil war provoked by the Sananikone government. More and more soldiers are unwilling to carry out "sweeping" operations, and an increasing number are defecting to the people's ranks with their weapons.

    老挝人民武装进行反“扫荡”
    迫使萨纳尼空政府军退出许多据点
    新华社河内12日电　据9月8日出版的“老挝爱国新闻”第一期报道：老挝丰沙里人民在最近用马刀、木棍、地雷、陷阱等胜利地抵抗了培·萨纳尼空政府军队的“扫荡”。人民武装力量迫使政府军队撤出了索脑、会岗、会雷、会混等四个地点。南娥县的一部分地区也摆脱了培·萨纳尼空政府军队的占领和镇压。
    8月30日，当芒科据点的一部分王国军队出外“扫荡”的时候，当地人民迫使留守的军队撤出了芒科。
    培·萨纳尼空政府军队在8月初也被迫撤出桑怒省的芒柏、沙通、索平、本豆、芒那等地。8月30日和31日，在川库县人民的压力下，培·萨纳尼空政府军队被迫撤出川库和芒赫两个地方。驻扎在马河沿岸的王国军队也逃走了。
    这样，桑怒省芒山县的大部分、赫芒县的一部分和川库县的一半以上的地方已经没有萨纳尼空政府的军队。
    在琅勃拉邦，王国军队在8月14日被迫撤出索桑地区。当地人民多次打退了王国军队在本车、芒威、芒险等地的“扫荡”。
    在老挝北部各省许多地方，人民举行了集会，通过了建议书，要求王国政府停止内战，恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的自由，要求恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    王国军队的官兵也越来越反对萨纳尼空政府挑起的内战。许多官兵不肯进行“扫荡”，带着武器投奔人民队伍的人已经越来越多。
