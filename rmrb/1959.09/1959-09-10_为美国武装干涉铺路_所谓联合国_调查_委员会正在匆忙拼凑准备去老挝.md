The representatives to the United Nations of the four member states of this committee - Italy, Argentina, Japan and Tunisia - already held their first meeting yesterday.

It is reported that the Italian representative, Ortona, announced after the meeting that they had respectively recommended to their governments that they designate candidates to participate in the on-the-spot "investigation" within twenty-four hours. It is said that the first batch of people from this "sub-committee" will fly to Laos this weekend.

    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：根据美国的意见非法决定成立的所谓联合国“调查”老挝情况的“小组委员会”正在被匆忙地拼凑起来，以便早日为美国盗用联合国旗帜武装干涉老挝创造条件。
    这个委员会的成员国意大利、阿根廷、日本和突尼斯四国的驻联合国的代表已经在昨天举行了第一次会议。
    据报道，意大利代表奥托纳会后宣布，他们已经分别向他们的政府建议在二十四小时内指定参加实地“调查”的人选。据说，这个“小组委员会”的第一批人将在本周末飞往老挝。
