Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 10th. Indian right-wing parties, which once played a leading role in interfering with the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan local rebellion, are now using the Sino-Indian border issue to launch frenzied anti-China and anti-communist activities.

While organizing anti-China demonstrations against the Chinese Embassy and Consulates, they are also launching a wider anti-China movement.

The "Indian Times" reported that the notorious Indian People's Socialist Party held a rally in Delhi on the 4th, starting their anti-China farce of "Don't Interfere with India Week." The People's Socialist Party leaders Meda and former Member of Parliament Kamat used all kinds of abusive and slanderous words to attack the so-called "Chinese aggression" at the meeting. Meda clamored that communism can do anything. Therefore, the "invasion" of the Indian border has reached a serious level.

Kamat nonsensically claimed that China's recent actions of first "invading" Tibet and now "invading" India have shattered Panchsheel. He demanded that India abandon the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, saying that it is useless to follow the Five Principles at this stage. Kamat also demanded that the Indian government send troops to Bhutan and Sikkim.

It is reported that the People's Socialist Party is also preparing to hold a "mass rally" and torchlight parade in Delhi on September 11, in an attempt to further stir up anti-China sentiment. The Assam People's Socialist Party also decided to hold a so-called "Don't Interfere with India Day" throughout the state on September 9 to protest the so-called "Chinese aggression against India."

Prior to this, it was reported that the People's Socialist Party of Ambala, Punjab, also gathered a group of people in Ambala on the 6th to hold an anti-China demonstration of "Don't Interfere with India." They shouted provocative slogans such as "Down with Chinese Imperialism." Sridharan, the general secretary of the Kerala State Committee of the People's Socialist Party, also organized anti-China activities in Kerala. On September 2, the staff of the People's Socialist Party held a meeting in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, clamoring for immediate action to drive the Chinese out of Indian territory. The meeting also passed a resolution declaring that the slogans of Panchsheel and the Sino-Indian people being brothers have proven to be a failure.

The National Executive Committee of the Indian People's Socialist Party also passed a bloody resolution on the "China Issue" on August 30. The resolution stated, "It seems that the Chinese government has decided to adopt an expansionist policy," "The Chinese have begun covert activities to establish a Himalayan Federation," "In the Northeast Frontier Agency (of India), the Chinese are carrying out open aggression," "And cutting off some of our (India's) territory." The resolution clamored, "India defends its borders, not only to defend itself, but also to defend the freedom and sovereignty of all Southeast Asian countries," "The probing claws of China must be twisted back." The resolution belligerently "demanded that (the Indian) government take firm measures to make China withdraw from the Indian areas it has occupied."

According to the "Hindustan Times," Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the leader of the All India People's League, viciously slandered that China's actions seriously endanger India's security and integrity. This reactionary league also uses the form of "Border Security Day" and "Border Security Week" to carry out anti-China activities.

It is reported that the Central Secretariat of the Indian Peasants and Workers Party also passed a "resolution" on the 6th, wantonly slandering China for invading Indian territory. The "resolution" incited, "The continued occupation or aggression of this area by the Chinese cannot be tolerated, otherwise we will resist with all our strength."

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Indian right-wing newspapers, which have been continuously clamoring against China for the past few months, have recently used the Sino-Indian border issue to clamor and agitate in unison, creating a high tide of anti-China propaganda similar to the Tibetan rebellion this year.

On August 29, these newspapers published in detail the speech made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru in the People's House on August 28, with sensational banner headlines, about the so-called "Chinese intrusion into Indian territory." They then published a large number of editorials (Delhi newspapers alone published about thirty in just three days, August 29, 30, and 31), stubbornly turning the events of Indian troops invading Chinese territory and attacking Chinese troops into a counter-accusation that China had "invaded" India. They made a big fuss about this, attempting to incite the Indian public's hatred towards China and create a tense atmosphere between China and India.

The "Indian Express" found its vocabulary from the terms commonly used in imperialist propaganda. It even said, "Communist China's aggression shows that imperialism is not necessarily monopolized by Europe, but can be extended to Asian powers that can pursue imperialism against weaker Asian countries"; "Communist imperialism is even worse than the Western imperialism that we know and have suffered from." Some newspapers incited the adoption of a "tough" attitude towards China. Newspapers such as "The Statesman" and "Amrita Bazar Patrika" advocated the establishment of so-called "strong defenses" on the Sino-Indian border. "The Glory" even wanted to stir up an atmosphere of war between China and India, two countries with no war records in history. It said: "If something unexpected happens, we believe India will have to take up arms." The "Hindustan Times" on August 27th even alarmistly said that in order to deal with the "threat" to India's northern border, India "must make missiles the main air defense weapon."

Indian right-wing newspapers, taking advantage of the tense atmosphere they created, tried their best to advocate that India abandon Sino-Indian friendship and change its peaceful and neutral policy. A special reporter for "New India Times" said in a commentary, "No matter how important the slogan of Sino-Indian friendship may have been in the past, today it has become meaningless." Manki Kar, editor of "Indian Express," demanded in a commentary on August 26 that India "re-estimate the basic principles of our (India's) foreign policy." He bluntly said, "The disillusionment with China and the first open threat on our northern border have somewhat reduced our lofty beliefs in neutralism and non-alignment. Currently, there is a growing understanding and concrete emphasis in the West on India's domestic and foreign policies and its role as a democratic fortress in Asia, which is promoting the above process."

At the same time, these newspapers also published many deliberately fabricated news, saying that Chinese troops invaded Bhutan and Sikkim, threatened Nepal, and intimidated small Himalayan countries. On August 13, the "Hindustan Times" quoted a fabricated news item sent to the "Daily Telegraph" by the British George Patterson, who appeared in Kalimpong as a journalist, saying that China wanted to "liberate" the Bhutanese, Sikkimese and Ladakhis of India. Some newspapers then openly declared that India would "protect" these small countries. The "Free Press" on August 27 said that if China "infiltrates" these small Himalayan countries, India "has an obligation to intervene and defend the sovereignty of these independent countries."

Some Indian newspapers also tried their best to spread slanderous remarks about China's threat to Southeast Asian countries, arbitrarily advocating that Southeast Asian countries should "act together" and "defend jointly" with India. The "Indian Express" on September 1st slandered China as a "Han imperialist," saying that "the Chinese dragon is likely to leap into South Asia and Southeast Asia." This newspaper confessed its conspiracy without being forced to, saying that "the countries and people of South Asia and Southeast Asia regard India as the main fortress of their anti-communist trend." Prior to this, this newspaper had also viciously provoked, "The non-communist countries around China are increasingly expecting to strengthen India's leadership role."

    煽动仇视中国　制造紧张局势
    印度右翼政党展开猖狂反华活动
    造谣诬蔑我国侵犯印度　鼓吹印度放弃印中友好
    新华社10日讯　新德里消息：曾经在干涉中国政府平息西藏地方叛乱事件中充当急先锋的印度右翼政党现在又借中印边界问题展开猖狂的反华反共活动。
    它们在组织对中国大使馆和领事馆的反华示威的同时，还在更大的范围内掀起反对中国的运动。
    “印度时报”报道，臭名远扬的印度人民社会党4日在德里举行集会，开始了他们的“不许干涉印度周”的反华丑剧。人民社会党首领梅达和前国会议员卡马特在会上使用一切辱骂和诬蔑的字眼来攻击所谓“中国侵略”。梅达叫嚣说，共产主义什么事都干得出来。因此“侵犯”印度边境事件就达到严重的程度。
    卡马特胡说什么中国最近先“侵略”西藏现在又“侵略”印度的行动使潘查希拉支离破碎。他要求印度抛弃和平共处五项原则，他说，在这个阶段上遵循五项原则一点也没有用处。卡马特还要求印度政府派遣军队到不丹和锡金去。
    据报道，人民社会党还准备9月11日在德里举行“群众集会”和火炬游行，企图进一步煽起反华情绪。阿萨姆邦人民社会党也决定于9月9日在全邦举行所谓“不许干涉印度日”，以抗议所谓“中国侵略印度”。
    在此以前，据报道，旁遮普邦翁巴拉的人民社会党也在6日在翁巴拉搜罗一批人举行了“不许干涉印度”的反华示威。他们高喊：“打倒中国帝国主义”等挑衅口号。人民社会党喀拉拉邦委员会总书记斯里德哈朗也在喀拉拉邦组织反华活动。9月2日，人民社会党的工作人员在北方邦哥拉克浦尔举行会议，叫嚣立即采取行动把中国人赶出印度领土。会议并且通过决议宣布，潘查希拉和印中人民是兄弟的口号已经证明是失败了。
    印度人民社会党全国执行委员会还曾在8月30日通过了一项含血喷人的关于“中国问题”的决议。决议说，“看来中国政府已经决定要采取扩张政策”，“中国人已经开始了建立喜马拉雅联邦的隐蔽活动”，“在（印度）东北边境特区，中国人进行公开的侵略”，“并且切掉我们（印度）的一些领土”。决议叫嚣说，“印度保卫它的边界，并不只是保卫它自己，而且是保卫所有东南亚国家的自由和主权”，“必须把中国的进行试探的脚爪扭回去”。决议剑拔弩张地“要求（印度）政府采取坚定的措施使中国退出它所占领的印度的地区”。
    据“印度斯坦时报”报道，全印人民同盟的首领巴志帕伊恶毒诬蔑中国的行动严重地危及印度的安全和完整。这个反动的同盟也利用搞“国境安全日”“国境安全周”的形式，进行反华活动。
    据报道，印度农工党中央书记处在6日也通过一项“决议”，大肆诬蔑中国侵犯了印度的领土，“决议”煽动说，“不能容忍中国人继续占领或侵略这个地区，否则我们将全力加以抵抗。”
    新华社10日讯　过去几个月一直在继续反华叫嚣的印度右翼报纸，最近利用中印边界问题齐声叫嚷鼓噪，气势汹汹，造成今年西藏叛乱事件以来的又一次反华宣传运动的高潮。
    8月29日，这些报纸都以煽动性的通栏标题详细刊载印度总理尼赫鲁8月28日在人民院发表的所谓“中国侵入印度领土”的讲话，接着就发表大量社论（仅8月29日、30日和31日三天德里报纸就发表了三十篇左右），硬把印度军队侵入中国领土并袭击中国军队的事件反咬一口说成是中国“侵犯”了印度。它们并就此大做文章，妄图煽动印度公众仇视中国的情绪，制造中印之间的紧张气氛。
    “印度快报”从帝国主义宣传常用的辞汇中找到了它的用语，它竟说什么，“共产党中国的侵略表明，帝国主义不一定是为欧洲所垄断的，而是可以扩大到能够对较弱的亚洲国家推行帝国主义的亚洲强国的”；“共产帝国主义甚至比我们所了解并且吃过苦头的西方帝国主义更糟。”有些报刊煽动说，要对中国采取“强硬”态度。“政治家报”、“甘露市场报”等报纸都鼓吹要在中印边境建立所谓“有力的防御”。“荣耀报”竟然要在历史上从没有战争记载的中印两国之间煽动战争的气氛。它说：“一旦发生不测事件，我们认为印度将不得不拿起武器。”“印度斯坦时报”8月27日更是耸人听闻地说，为了对付印度的北部边界的“威胁”，印度“必须使导弹成为主要的防空武器”。
    印度右翼报纸利用它们制造出来的紧张气氛，竭力鼓吹印度放弃中印友好和改变和平中立政策。“新印度时报”的特派记者在一篇评论中说，“不管印中友好的口号在过去可能有怎样的重要意义，今天它已经成为毫无意义的了。”“印度快报”主编曼基卡尔8月26日在一篇评论中要求印度“重新估计我们（印度）的外交政策的基本原则。”他露骨地说，“对中国的幻灭以及在我们北部边界第一次存在的公然威胁，多少要缩小我们对中立主义和不结盟政策的崇高信念。目前在西方有一种逐渐更加了解和具体重视印度的内外政策以及它在亚洲所起的民主堡垒的作用的趋向，这种趋向正在促进上述那个过程”。
    同时，这些报纸还刊登了许多故意捏造的消息，说中国军队侵入不丹、锡金，威胁尼泊尔，恫吓喜马拉雅山小国。8月13日“印度斯坦时报”引用以记者身份出现在噶伦堡的英国人乔治·派特逊发给“每日电讯报”的一篇捏造消息说，中国要“解放”不丹人、锡金人和印度的拉达克人。一些报刊接着公然宣扬印度将“保护”这些小国。8月27日的“自由新闻”说，如果中国“渗入”这些喜马拉雅山小国，印度“有义务进行干预，保卫这些独立国家的主权”。
    印度一些报刊还极力散布诬蔑中国对东南亚各国的威胁，恣意鼓吹东南亚各国要同印度“共同行动”、“联合防御”之类的论调。“印度快报”9月1日诬蔑中国是“汉帝国主义者”，说“中国巨龙很可能跃进到南亚和东南亚”。这家报纸不打自招地供认了自己的阴谋，它说什么“南亚和东南亚的国家和人民把印度看成他们反共潮流的主要堡垒。”在这以前，这家报纸也曾恶毒地挑拨说，“中国周围的非共产党国家日益期望加强印度的领导作用。”
