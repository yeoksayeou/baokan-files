    I Love the Chinese People
    Albanian Writer Anton Kuqiali

    Great China and Albania are separated by thousands of miles, and in the past, it was difficult for us to connect. Although China and Albania are new friends, we share common beliefs. Today, this friendship is increasingly consolidated and developed in the new world, in the great socialist camp.

    In the past, China was like a mythical country to us, and the Chinese people were not well understood. But today, our people have learned a lot about China, understanding that the Chinese people are building a new life, and also understanding the lofty ideals that connect us. Today, we talk about and praise the Chinese people's long and heroic struggle against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries; we are elated by the unparalleled achievements the Chinese people have made in the national industrialization and the people's communes.

    Perhaps some might think: China is so big, the population is so large, they find it hard to think of Albania on the other side of the earth and the Albanian people living on the Adriatic coast. However, they are wrong. Earlier this year, I visited China for a month and saw many interesting and beautiful things, and I was also excited to see that the Chinese people knew a lot about Albania, even more than they should know. When I visited the huge heavy machinery manufacturing plant in Wuhan, one of the factory leaders accompanying me said: "All the machines in our factory are sent by brotherly countries, including the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, and of course, Albania is also helping us." "How is this possible!" I replied in great surprise, "We don't produce machines!" "That doesn't matter," he replied, "You support us spiritually." These simple and sincere words touched me deeply.

    In Chongqing, people gave me a special reception, not only because I was a friend, but also because I was the first Albanian to visit the city. I met the chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Artists Association, whom I had met in Albania. We met like old friends because we knew each other in Tirana. He created beautiful woodcuts with Albanian themes, and he talked enthusiastically about Albania, talking about everything he had seen.

    In Chongqing, as in other cities, people asked me many questions about Albania, and they all praised the Albanian Labor Party's brave struggle against revisionism with admiration. I introduced many facts about the despicable subversion carried out by our Party's enemies in our country, which moved many Chinese comrades. I also talked about the great help given to us by the Chinese Communist Party, and the wise articles in the Chinese newspapers played a great role in the struggle against our Party's enemies and in the struggle against the enemies who undermine the unity of the socialist camp headed by the glorious Soviet Union. I was deeply moved by the care I received everywhere in China. When I was cruising on the Yangtze River, there were two soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with me. I wanted to draw a picture for them, and when they found out I was Albanian, they immediately started talking to me cordially and invited me to their room, poured me tea, and asked me when I arrived. They also asked me uneasily if I had stopped in Belgrade when I passed by? When I told them that I flew directly to Moscow on a "Tu-104" plane, they smiled, and the uneasy look on their faces disappeared. From the laughter, I saw the sincerity of the Chinese people.

    In China, I saw towering giant factories, and countless blast furnaces constantly rising, burning day and night. The Chinese people's unparalleled enthusiasm for work, and the Chinese people's soaring energy, convinced me that no force can stop the Chinese people from marching towards socialism and communism.

    我热爱中国人民
    阿尔巴尼亚作家  安东·库恰利
    伟大的中国和阿尔巴尼亚相隔万里之遥，过去我们联系是很困难的。中国和阿尔巴尼亚虽然是新的朋友，但是我们却有着共同的信念。今天这种友谊在新的世界里，在伟大的社会主义阵营里日益巩固和发展。
    过去中国对我们说来像一个神话的国家，而对中国的人民可以说是很不了解。但今天我国人民对中国已了解了很多，了解到中国人民正在建设新生活，也了解了把我们联系在一起的崇高的理想。今天我们谈论和赞美中国人民为反对日本侵略者和国民党反动派进行的长期的英勇斗争；我们为中国人民在为国家工业化和人民公社方面所取得的不可比拟的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    也许有人会这样想：中国是这样的大，人口是这样的多，他们很难想到地球另一面的阿尔巴尼亚和生活在亚德里亚海岸的阿尔巴尼亚人民。但是，他们想错了。今年年初我曾在中国访问了一个月，看到了许多有趣的、美丽的东西，同时也兴奋地看到中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚了解得很多，甚至了解的比应该知道的还要多。当我在武汉参观巨大的重型机器制造厂时，伴同我的一位工厂领导人对我说：“我们工厂所有的机器都是兄弟国家送来的，有苏联、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚，不用说阿尔巴尼亚也在帮助我们。”“这怎么可能呢！”我非常惊奇地回答，“我们是不生产机器的！”“这没关系”，他回答说，“你们在精神上支持我们。”这句纯朴而又真诚的话使我非常感动。
    在重庆时，人们给了我特别的接待，不仅因为我是朋友，而且因为我是访问这个城市的第一个阿尔巴尼亚人，我会见了曾经在阿尔巴尼亚见过的四川省美术协会主席，我们像老朋友一样见了面，因为我们在地拉那就相识了。他以阿尔巴尼亚的题材创作了美丽的木刻，他热情地谈论着阿尔巴尼亚，谈到他所看到的一切。
    在重庆像和其他城市一样，人们问我许多有关阿尔巴尼亚的问题，他们都怀着敬佩的心情称赞阿尔巴尼亚劳动党反对修正主义的勇敢的斗争。我介绍了我们党的敌人在我国所进行的卑鄙颠复的许多事实，感动了很多中国同志。我也谈到了中国共产党给予我们的巨大帮助，中国报纸的明智的文章在反击我们党的敌人的斗争中、在反击破坏以光荣苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的敌人的斗争中起了很大的作用。在中国，我到处都受到人们的关怀，这些深深地感动了我。当我在长江上乘船游览时，正好有两位中国人民解放军的战士和我在一起。我想给他们画一张画，当他们知道我是阿尔巴尼亚人时，马上就同我亲切地谈起来了，并请我到他们的房间里去，替我斟上了茶，问起了我什么时候到这儿来的。他们还不安地问我，经过贝尔格莱德时停了没有？当我告诉他们我是乘“图—104”飞机直接飞到莫斯科时，他们笑了，脸上不安的神情也就消失了，从笑声里我看到了中国人民的真诚。
    在中国，我看到了林立的巨大的工厂，不断地耸立起来的无数的高炉，正在日夜燃烧着。中国人民对工作的无可比拟的热情，中国人民的冲天干劲，使我深信，没有任何一种力量能阻挠中国人民走向社会主义和共产主义。
