Highlighting the Splendid Decade

Hold High the Red Banner of the General Line and Accelerate the Development of Transportation
Minister of Communications Wang Shoudao

Over the past decade, the mileage of highways open to traffic has increased more than fourfold; the mileage of inland waterways open to navigation has more than doubled; and civil aviation routes have reached 33,000 kilometers.

In the glorious decade of the New China, China's transportation workers, along with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, have achieved brilliant accomplishments with the heroic spirit of "making mountains bow their heads and rivers make way."

In old China, from the birth of China's first highway – the Changsha to Xiangtan highway in Hunan in 1913 – to 1948, 130,000 kilometers of highways were built in 36 years, an average of only 3,600 kilometers per year. At the beginning of liberation, due to the destruction of many highways during the Kuomintang's defeat and retreat, and years of disrepair, the total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide was only 75,000 kilometers. By the end of 1958, the mileage of highways open to traffic in our country had reached 400,000 kilometers, an average annual increase of more than 32,000 kilometers. In particular, the road-building heroes of New China, under Chairman Mao's great call to "help all fraternal ethnic groups, fear no difficulties, and strive to build roads," cleaved through towering peaks and precipitous cliffs, and crossed snow-capped mountains and deserts, building famous highways such as the Kangzang, Qingzang, and Xinzang on the roof of the world. Before liberation, the national automobile freight volume was at most 8.19 million tons per year; in 1958, China's automobile freight volume reached 176.3 million tons.

China has crisscrossing rivers and a long coastline, providing ample conditions for the development of water transport. However, at the beginning of liberation, the total mileage of inland waterways open to navigation nationwide was only 73,000 kilometers. By 1958, the mileage of inland waterways open to navigation in our country had reached 150,000 kilometers. In particular, night navigation is now possible on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, known as a natural barrier. Combined with water conservancy construction, many plain areas are undergoing river network construction, and white sails have also been hoisted in some mountainous and desert areas. In addition, modern ports such as Zhanjiang and Yuxikou have been built, and huge renovation projects have begun on the Grand Canal from Beijing to Hangzhou. From the establishment of the China Merchants Bureau in 1872, the national steamship and barge freight volume in the best year before liberation was only 12.64 million tons, while in 1958, China's steamship and barge freight volume reached 76.36 million tons.

During the period of the Kuomintang reactionaries, China's civil aviation was completely manipulated by imperialist countries. After liberation, China's civil aviation department established China's independent and self-reliant civil aviation industry almost from scratch. By 1958, the mileage of civil aviation routes had reached 33,000 kilometers. In particular, it also rapidly developed aviation services directly serving industrial and agricultural production, such as industrial transportation, aerial photography, geophysical prospecting, geological surveys, elimination of crop pests and diseases, forest fire prevention, forest surveys, and aerial seeding.

Over the past decade, especially during the people's commune movement and the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the tremendous achievements made by the New China's transportation industry are beyond the reach of the transportation industry of old China.

“Looking up, a wisp of sky, looking down, a white river beach,
Carried on the back or shouldered, tired with aching waist and sore legs.
					×　×　×
Eating chaff and swallowing coarse vegetables, without decent clothes to wear,
One careless step, and the corpse cannot be found.”

This is a mountain song in which many people in the mountainous areas of old China lamented the inconvenience of transportation. However, the Chinese people have stood up, and the era of singing such tragic mountain songs has gone forever. Now, resounding through the clouds is praise for the Party, for Chairman Mao, and for the new life and new transportation conditions:

“A thunderclap in the flatlands, the sun shines on the high mountains.
Thousand-year-old deep mountains have been opened up, and white sails are flying on the rivers for generations.
Singing the praises of the wise Chairman Mao, singing the praises of the great Communist Party.
We pledge to you, to transport more steel and more grain.”

The Socialist Transformation of Capitalist and Individual Transportation Industries Has Achieved Great Victory

The great achievements made by China's transportation industry over the past decade are the victory of the Party's general line for the transition period and the Party's general line for socialist construction on the transportation front.

At the beginning of liberation, the proportion of the state-owned economy in the entire transportation industry was still very small; while on its two wings, private capitalist transportation accounted for a considerable proportion, and individual transportation was even more numerous. At that time, private shipping accounted for 57% of the country's shipping tonnage, private automobiles accounted for 75% of the total number of business automobiles in the country; the number of individual wooden sailboats reached more than 3.1 million tons, and the number of individual animal-powered vehicles reached hundreds of thousands. This was a vast and complex transportation front with a wide distribution. Here, the question of who would win between capitalism and socialism was obvious. The Party has constantly taught that, during the transition period, it is necessary not only to firmly grasp the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, but also to firmly grasp the socialist transformation of private capitalist transportation and individual transportation. Because the transportation industry is an extremely important component of the national economy. Socialism must not only achieve victory in the industrial and agricultural sectors, but also in the transportation sector that connects industry and agriculture.

According to the Party's instructions, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, while consolidating and expanding the state-owned transportation force, the national transportation departments implemented a policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist transportation industries, made overall arrangements for them, implemented the "three unifications" policy (namely, unified freight rates, unified sources of goods, and unified dispatch), and strengthened the transformation of enterprises and capitalists by means of grouping into teams or joint operations. At the end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956, with the arrival of the nationwide upsurge of agricultural cooperativization and the upsurge of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, China's capitalist transportation industry implemented joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, and when carrying out economic reorganization, most of them implemented unified management with the state-owned transportation industry, based on the characteristics of the mobility of vehicles and ships.

While carrying out socialist transformation of the capitalist transportation industry, socialist transformation was also carried out on the individual transportation industry. After liberation, the Party led individual transporters to smash the feudal head system. Then, the local transportation departments continuously carried out collectivist education on them, helped them to consciously and voluntarily form mutual aid groups or mutual aid teams, and organized transportation cooperatives, so that they could recognize the superiority of the cooperative road based on their own experience. Thus, in the upsurge of socialist transformation at the end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956, the individual transportation industry smoothly embarked on the socialist road. The wooden sailboat transportation industry formed nearly 3,000 transportation cooperatives, and the animal-powered vehicle transportation industry formed nearly 2,000 cooperatives. In the first year after the cooperativization of the individual transportation industry, the transportation efficiency of wooden sailboats increased by an average of 14.7% compared with individual operation, and the income of cooperative members increased by 15%; the transportation efficiency of animal-powered vehicles increased by 46% compared with individual operation, and the income of cooperative members increased by 33.6%.

The Great Leap Forward in Transportation is Composed of Mass Movements in Three Areas: Transportation Construction, Mass Transportation, and Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution

During the period of restoring the national economy and the First Five-Year Plan, the highway, water transport, and civil aviation industries have all developed greatly; however, the broad masses of people demanded to change the backwardness of the transportation industry more quickly and accelerate the construction speed. In particular, after the Party put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it further aroused the enthusiasm of the 650 million people to build socialism, and national industrial and agricultural production immediately leaped forward with the force of a thunderbolt and the speed of a thousand miles a day. The broad masses of people's desire to accelerate the speed of transportation construction became even more urgent. They said: "To promote socialist agricultural tools, we must change the roads of the feudal era." The task of technological revolution proposed by the Party at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress also called for "establishing a transportation network with modern tools as the mainstay and reaching out in all directions throughout the country." The situation forced the transportation departments to leap forward together with industry and agriculture to promote the development of production.

In order to adapt to this situation, the transportation departments at all levels and the broad masses of transportation cadres conducted in-depth study of the Party's general line for socialist construction, criticized the guiding ideology of "straight, special, and high" that existed among some transportation cadres, which neglected putting politics in command, unilaterally emphasized vertical leadership and business leadership, neglected implementing the mass line, unilaterally emphasized relying on professional teams and specialized technical personnel, and neglected popularization and blindly pursued high standards and modernization. They clearly put forward the guiding ideology of "local, mass, and popular" of relying on the leadership of local Party committees at all levels, relying on the broad masses of people and the broad masses of workers and staff, and combining popularization and improvement, with popularization as the mainstay at present. In this way, the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses and workers and staff on the transportation front was further stimulated. With the unfolding of the people's commune movement and the nationwide steelmaking movement, a vigorous mass transportation Great Leap Forward movement was launched.

The Great Leap Forward in Transportation is composed of mass movements in three areas: transportation construction, mass transportation, and technological innovation and technological revolution. In the transportation construction movement, under the slogan of "small effort with great effect, great effort with small effect, and surprise attack when not busy," the broad masses of people enthusiastically built roads, dredged rivers, built airports, and built vehicles and ships on a large scale. In the mass transportation movement, in order to rush the transportation of steel, coal, and agricultural and sideline products, in addition to mobilizing various modern means of transportation to participate in transportation, the transportation departments at all levels, under the leadership of the local Party committees, mobilized various folk means of transportation from the broad masses of rural people's communes to form transportation companies, transportation battalions, or transportation regiments to participate in transportation. In the cities, citizens, government cadres, and students were mobilized to participate in short-distance transportation. Some provinces also actively opened local civil aviation routes to transport workers, cadres, and emergency supplies. In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, a widespread mass movement to change the transportation method of carrying on shoulders and backs was launched in the broad masses of rural areas. In the plains and relatively flat areas, vehicleization and railization were carried out on a large scale; in places where rivers were navigable, shipping was carried out on a large scale; and in mountainous areas, hilly areas, and places where slopes could be utilized, cableways and chutes were carried out on a large scale. In vehicle and ship transportation cooperatives and various modern transportation enterprises, in order to fully tap transportation potential, technological innovation and technological revolution movements were also widely carried out. At that time, there were thousands upon thousands of transportation construction teams in every region, a mighty transportation army on every transportation line, and a dazzling array of mass creations in every transportation enterprise. This was truly a magnificent picture of an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in Transportation.

In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward in Transportation, 150,000 kilometers of new highways were built (including about 140,000 kilometers of simple highways), equivalent to more than twice the increase in highway mileage during the First Five-Year Plan period; 10,000 kilometers of inland waterways were improved and newly added, equivalent to twice the mileage of waterways improved during the First Five-Year Plan period; and 19 new local civil aviation routes were opened. The total freight volume completed by highways, waterways, and civil aviation in 1958 increased by 50% compared with 1957 (excluding the part transported by organs and enterprises themselves).

After a short period of rectification of the mass construction and transportation teams in 1959, the transportation front continued to leap forward. In particular, according to the Party's call, a red flag competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy was launched, thereby achieving tremendous achievements on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In the first half of this year, the freight volume of highways, waterways, and civil aviation increased by 73% compared with the same period last year. In terms of capital construction, in addition to repairing and improving the highways and waterways of last year, many new highways have been built and many waterways have been opened up. In particular, large-scale expansions have been carried out on twelve ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou.

The People's Communes Provide Huge Transportation and Transportation Construction Potential

The Great Leap Forward in Transportation has enabled the broad masses on the transportation front to more deeply understand the greatness and correctness of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and has gained extremely rich experience in developing China's transportation industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The experience of the Great Leap Forward in Transportation first proves that the 500 million peasants after the realization of the people's commune are the basic force for China to carry out transportation construction. Because the people's commune has a large organizational scale and a wide range of activities, it can run transportation construction that is difficult for advanced agricultural production cooperatives to run, it can closely combine workers, peasants, and merchants; it can arrange a part of the transportation capacity to specifically undertake transportation tasks; it can accelerate the implementation of transportation mechanization and semi-mechanization. It is precisely because the people's commune has brought these favorable conditions to transportation that it has provided huge transportation and transportation construction potential. Taking the highway transportation industry as an example, of the 150,000 kilometers of new highways added in 1958, about 100,000 kilometers were built by the people's communes; the short-distance transportation tasks in the large-scale steelmaking and agricultural bumper harvest movements were also mostly completed by the transportation force of the people's communes.

The experience of the Great Leap Forward proves that there are many benefits to the people's communes running transportation (including building roads, opening waterways, road maintenance, etc., the same below). With convenient transportation conditions, the people's communes can facilitate the promotion of agricultural machinery and new agricultural tools, ensure timely fertilization, cultivation, and harvesting, and save labor; they can timely transport fertilizer, seeds, agricultural tools, and various industrial products, and timely transport agricultural and sideline products, develop the commune's commerce, and promote the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. In addition, the people's communes can also increase the commune's sideline income by running transportation. The transportation of the people's communes is an important component of the entire national transportation. After the internal transportation conditions of the people's communes are improved and the transportation force is strengthened, it can not only free up the national transportation departments to concentrate on completing the transportation tasks of main lines and important branch lines, but also, when the country needs it, it can transfer a part of the force to support the main lines and branch lines. Therefore, in order to accelerate the development of China's transportation industry, we should let the people's communes run transportation without reservation, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the 500 million peasants for transportation construction.

Implement Both Modern Means of Transportation and Folk Means of Transportation

The experience of the Great Leap Forward in Transportation also proves that it must also implement the Party's policy of walking on two legs. The most important thing in implementing walking on two legs in the transportation industry is to implement both modern means of transportation and folk means of transportation. Modern means of transportation can pull more, run faster, transport farther, and have lower costs, and are the backbone of the transportation industry. However, their number is still very small and can only undertake the tasks of main lines and important branch lines. Their shortcomings need to be supplemented by folk means of transportation, which are large in number and widely distributed. China is a large agricultural country, and in the development of the national economy, it is necessary to implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. Especially after the 500 million peasants have embarked on the road of people's communes, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery are all leaping forward at a rapid pace. The industrial development of our country is also implementing the simultaneous development of heavy industry and light industry, central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production. Various factories are distributed all over the country like stars. These characteristics of the national economy are reflected in the transportation industry, that is, the volume of short-distance transportation is increasing day by day. This requires the transportation industry to penetrate into various economic regions and the smallest commodity producing areas, face the broad masses of rural areas and industrial and mining areas, and meet the needs of the 500 million peasants and the production and life of the broad masses of small and medium-sized enterprises. And the transportation industry can only adapt to this characteristic of the development of the national economy by implementing the simultaneous development of modern means of transportation and folk means of transportation.

Implementing the simultaneous development of modern means of transportation and folk means of transportation requires not only overall consideration in transportation, but also a series of corresponding construction policies. For example, in terms of highways, it is necessary not only to build main highways, but also to build simple highways, large vehicle roads, and pack animal trails suitable for local folk means of transportation. In terms of water transport, it is necessary not only to dredge large rivers and streams, but also to develop tributaries and small rivers; it is necessary not only to build large ports, but also to build small and medium-sized ports. In terms of vehicle and ship loading and unloading and repair, it is necessary to have not only foreign machinery, but also indigenous machinery. In a word, walking on two legs is the only way for the high-speed development of China's entire transportation industry.

Mass Movements Must Also Be Carried Out on a Large Scale in Modern Transportation Enterprises

The experience of the Great Leap Forward in Transportation also proves that mass movements must also be carried out on a large scale in various modern transportation enterprises. In the past, because some leading cadres unilaterally emphasized the centralization of modern transportation scheduling, the safety of operation, and the precision of machine parts, and emphasized top-down administrative management and rules and regulations, they did not dare to let go and mobilize the masses; because some leading cadres and technical cadres had the problem of bureaucracy, they could not go deep into the lines to integrate with the workers, timely adopt the workers' rationalization proposals, and solve the problems raised by the workers, and some rules and regulations were not entirely reasonable. Therefore, in various modern transportation enterprises, there was a lack of vigorous mass movements. Some mass socialist competitions were also intermittent, sometimes hot and sometimes cold, and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers was not fully utilized. In the Great Leap Forward, after various modern transportation enterprises promoted the method of "cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, reforming unreasonable rules and regulations, and combining leading personnel, technical personnel, and the masses of workers," and fully utilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and staff, they solved many major problems that had never been solved. For example, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau, since the promotion of the advanced experience of push-tow transportation, the fleet has been lengthened, blocking the view of the push wheel driving, causing difficulties in driving operation and affecting the further development of the propulsion formation. Although many efforts had been made in the past, they ultimately failed to be completely resolved because they only circled among a small number of technical personnel and did not fully mobilize the masses. In the Great Leap Forward, Comrade Zhang Jinhai, the captain of the 601 engine of the bureau, under the leadership of the Party, relied on the masses and worked hard for forty days, finally successfully trial-produced the "long-distance electric driving centralized control instrument," and later, on this basis, produced a more complete "movable ship driving centralized device." After promotion, the masses created various driving centralized devices with different structures according to different types of diesel engine power ships. At present, 60% of the ships on the Yangtze River have installed this device. Due to the development of mass technological innovation movement in the Civil Aviation Administration during the Great Leap Forward, the number of days of factory repair for Il-14 aircraft was shortened by 88% compared with 1957. These examples vividly illustrate that only by carrying out mass movements on a large scale and fully utilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers can transportation tasks be better completed.

The practice of the Great Leap Forward in Transportation has further enriched the content of the "local, mass, and popular" transportation construction policy. Summarizing the above experiences of the Great Leap Forward, the basic points of the "local, mass, and popular" transportation construction policy can be expressed as follows: under the illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, resolutely rely on the leadership of local Party committees at all levels, carry out mass movements on a large scale, make a big fuss about the technological revolution, fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people and the broad masses of workers and staff, implement the simultaneous development of central transportation enterprises and local transportation enterprises, the simultaneous development of modern means of transportation and folk means of transportation, the simultaneous development of modern repair and loading and unloading machinery and various simple repair and loading and unloading machinery, so that trunk line transportation and branch line transportation, long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation are combined, so that popularization and improvement are combined, and popularization is the mainstay at present, so that various transportation methods of water, land, and air are comprehensively developed, so that transportation is comprehensively utilized with agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, etc., so that industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce are carried out simultaneously, and production, transportation, supply, and sales are combined, in order to develop the transportation industry at a high speed, and build China's transportation network with modern tools as the mainstay and reaching out in all directions throughout the country as soon as possible, to better serve industrial and agricultural production, the broad masses of people, and national defense construction.

Only by Opposing Rightist Ideology Can We Implement the Party's General Line and Develop the Transportation Industry at a High Speed

Domestic and foreign reactionaries saw that the transportation industry had achieved tremendous victories under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and they were terrified and barked wildly. Some right-leaning opportunists, in order to negate the general line of building socialism and negate the tremendous achievements made by the nationwide mass steelmaking, large-scale water conservancy, agricultural production increase, and people's commune movements, also viciously attacked China's unprecedented and vigorous transportation construction movement. There are also a few comrades on the transportation front who have serious right-leaning thoughts. These comrades underestimate or even negate the tremendous achievements of the Great Leap Forward in Transportation, and exaggerate certain shortcomings and mistakes in the work. They often spread slackness, discouragement, complaints, and pessimistic emotions, and pour cold water on the masses and cadres. In order to make the transportation industry continue to leap forward rapidly along the Party's general line for socialist construction, this right-leaning ideology must be severely refuted and thoroughly criticized.

In the Great Leap Forward in Transportation, in the vigorous mass movement, a brand-new transportation order has emerged. The leading comrades in charge of transportation work of the Party committees and governments of the central, provincial, municipal, special, and county levels, as well as many people's communes, took the lead in organizing powerful transportation headquarters with the joint participation of various relevant departments of production, transportation, and sales. They arranged the transportation order according to the urgency and importance of materials on a quarterly, monthly, ten-day, or even daily basis; they allocated transportation tasks according to the capacity and characteristics of various means of transportation; and they were responsible for organizing the division of labor and collaboration among various transportation departments and material departments, as well as various different means of transportation. Recently, the transportation headquarters at all levels, based on summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward, have implemented unified planning, unified freight rates, and unified sources of goods, overcoming the phenomenon of uneven freight rates and competing for good lines and good goods that once occurred in individual areas for a short period of time. And they have determined the dispatching principle of closely combining regular transportation and surprise transportation, and professional transportation forces and mass transportation forces. In the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses also established a new transportation order at various transportation sites. For example, they divided driving routes for motorized and non-motorized vehicles and implemented dedicated line transportation; they established civilian-run traffic police on busy routes, etc. In particular, under the leadership of the local Party committees, many transportation departments broke down departmentalism, implemented "one-dragon" transportation cooperation among factories, mines, railways, ports, ships, and cargo owners, developed combined water and land transportation, and enriched the content of transportation organization science. This is a new transportation order that is most conducive to the Great Leap Forward, most conducive to completing transportation tasks, and most conducive to maximizing transportation efficiency. However, some people with right-leaning thoughts believe that the Great Leap Forward in Transportation has disrupted the transportation order. They do not understand that there are two types of transportation order: one is the cold and desolate transportation order of only professional transportation departments running transportation, and the other is the vigorous transportation order of completing transportation tasks by means of mass movements. The transportation order they say has been disrupted is that cold and desolate transportation order, which cannot meet the transportation needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The argument of "disrupting the transportation order" is essentially opposing carrying out mass movements on a large scale on the transportation front.

In the vigorous mass movement of carrying out transportation construction on a large scale, the broad masses have created many valuable experiences in manufacturing simple tools and building simple roads, which are worth drawing on by experts. For example, in Chicheng County, Hebei Province, there is a Batu Camp Black River. During the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the local Party committee, the local masses built a stone arch bridge 85 meters long and 6 meters wide, using local materials. It was built both strong and beautiful, with an average cost of only 680 yuan per meter (the cost of a general stone arch bridge needs about 2,000 yuan per meter). The masses call it the Dongfeng Bridge. All highway technicians who have visited the bridge in person have been amazed. However, some people with right-leaning thoughts say that "high yield cannot be high quality, and high quality cannot be high yield," and believe that much of the transportation construction carried out during the Great Leap Forward is "rough and shoddy." In 1958, the simple highways, tributaries and small rivers developed, and simple vehicles and ships and machinery manufactured by the broad masses were indeed not as good as high-grade highways and trunk waterways, and not as good as modern vehicles and ships and machinery. However, they are the objective needs of the rural people's communes and the widespread flowering of industry in our country. In 1958, 75% of the highway freight volume and 66% of the water transport freight volume were completed by these simple folk means of transportation and through these simple highways and small river waterways. As for the various indigenous simple means of transportation (including earth tracks, slides, chutes, earth vehicles, etc.) used in agricultural field transportation, water conservancy construction site transportation, people's communes, and the internal transportation of various steel and coal joint bases, they are even more incomparable to modern tools. However, without these simple means of transportation, without these simple roads and tributary small rivers, it would be impossible to complete the rapidly growing transportation tasks on the steel front and the agricultural front. Moreover, quality and standards must never be confused. We need simple tools and roads. According to the specifications of these simple tools and roads, they are manufactured and constructed and put into transportation, which meets the quality requirements. We cannot use the standards of those high-grade modern roads and tools to measure them. People with right-leaning thoughts say that the transportation construction in the Great Leap Forward is "rough and shoddy," and in fact they oppose building simple roads and folk means of transportation according to China's objective needs and financial and material resources. Of course, in the early days of the Great Leap Forward, some places did not have experience, the technical guidance of the transportation departments had not kept up, and after the old conservative technical standards were overturned, new technical standards had not been established, and only at this time did some construction and manufacturing indeed neglect quality. However, when the technical guidance work caught up, new technical standards were established, especially after quality appraisal and product finalization were carried out based on existing experience, some phenomena of neglecting quality were quickly overcome. The reason why people with right-leaning thoughts want to exaggerate these shortcomings that we have already corrected, which at most are only "one finger," is not really to care about the quality of transportation construction, but to disagree with the Party's policy of walking on two legs.

In the Great Leap Forward in Transportation, after improving labor organization and carrying out technological innovation, the transportation construction carried out by means of mass movements mostly conformed to the principle of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. For example, the stone arch bridge in Chicheng that we mentioned earlier is an example. The opening of the local civil aviation route from Taiyuan to Changzhi in Shanxi Province during the Great Leap Forward is also an example. From the construction of the airport and the installation of communication and navigation equipment to the official opening of the route, the entire process took less than twenty days. When building the Changzhi Airport, the masses were enthusiastic and took pride in personally participating in the construction of their hometown's airport. They not only worked hard day and night, but also thought of many ways to save 80% of the construction cost for the country. It should also be specifically pointed out here that this mass transportation construction movement can not only be greater, faster, better, and more economical, but also can quickly train technical personnel. For example, in Wuhua County, Guangdong Province, during the Great Leap Forward in Transportation in 1958, not only were 275 kilometers of highways, three large wooden bridges over 200 meters long, and many culverts and local roads built, but also 326 junior technical personnel and 536 skilled workers were trained by means of combining the Party secretary, technical personnel, and members of the people's communes and running training classes. It is a fact that the transportation cost of mass transportation is higher than that of modern means of transportation. However, because of the mass transportation movement, the simultaneous development of modern means of transportation and folk means of transportation, and the satisfaction of the transportation needs of the rural people's communes and the widespread flowering of industry, this is worth more than it costs. Taking highway transportation as an example, if the goods transported by the masses in 1958 were all transported by automobiles, tens of thousands of new automobiles would be needed. Even with automobiles, highways and corresponding maintenance equipment would still be needed. Is it worthwhile for us to wait for automobiles and affect industrial and agricultural production? Or is it worthwhile for us to spend a little more transportation costs to ensure the needs of industrial and agricultural production? This is a very clear calculation. Moreover, with the rectification of labor organization and the development of technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the transportation force of the masses has greatly saved labor and costs are constantly decreasing. For example, after the transportation team of the people's commune established a professional team and implemented the three guarantees (guarantee task, guarantee quality, guarantee income) and five fixations (fix personnel, fix tools, fix load, fix mileage, fix expenditure), they have reduced vehicles and labor by multiples, and completed more transportation tasks than in the past. In the early days of the Great Leap Forward, Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province mobilized 40,000 people in the city to engage in intra-city transportation. Later, because the labor organization was rectified, a system was established, and especially after the mass transportation team was armed with tools, the regular mass transportation team in the city was reduced by 90%. Why do people with right-leaning thoughts completely ignore these facts and insist that the Great Leap Forward in Transportation is a "human wave tactics" and is "wasting manpower and material resources"?

Our country is a "poor and blank" country, and it is impossible for us not to have difficulties in our work. However, it is precisely because of the difficulties that we must resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and go all out and aim high. It is also in the Great Leap Forward, in the mass movement, that we have found many ways to overcome difficulties. For example, many places have used the method of making a big fuss about the towing of vehicles and ships to realize the slogan of "one vehicle as two vehicles" and "one ship as two ships" and fully tap the transportation potential. Many places have opened up many new sources of materials by vigorously repairing discarded parts and materials and using local materials and appropriately using substitutes. In order to shorten the repair time of vehicles, ships, and airplanes and overcome the difficulty of insufficient repair capacity, many places have created a rapid repair method. Similar examples are too numerous to mention. The practice of the Great Leap Forward vividly proves that any difficulties we encounter are difficulties in progress. As long as we work hard, practically, and cleverly, no difficulties can hinder our victorious advance. However, some people with right-leaning thoughts see things but not people, and only see objective difficulties but not the subjective initiative of people. They use the pretext of implementing the plan to endlessly reduce the plan indicators, and even say, "Implementing the plan means completing as much as possible." They do not go all out, aim high, have high morale, and are full of vitality, but complain and retreat in fear. If this mood of fear of difficulty gains the upper hand, our cause will not only not leap forward, but will not be able to move forward even one step.

In short, right-leaning ideology has become the main danger on the current transportation front. If these right-leaning ideologies are not opposed, the transportation industry will not be able to thoroughly implement the Party's general line, will not be able to develop at a high speed, and will not be able to continue to leap forward. At present, the broad masses of workers and staff on the transportation front are deeply studying and implementing the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, opposing the right, boosting their energy, further carrying out the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and launching a new production upsurge, striving to complete the total transportation volume target of the Second Five-Year Plan this year, using new achievements to commemorate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and using practical actions to counter the rumors and slanders of domestic and foreign reactionaries and right-leaning opportunists.

Of course, the broad masses of workers and staff on China's transportation front are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. We know that although the achievements of transportation construction over the past decade have been great, they have not fundamentally changed the backwardness of China's transportation and cannot keep up with the needs of the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, the tasks before us are still very arduous. We must hold the red banner of the general line even higher and advance victoriously on the basis of the great achievements we have made in the past decade. Let the domestic and foreign reactionaries and right-leaning opportunists weep in their corners! Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, we will surely achieve even greater achievements in the process of continuing to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, in carrying out the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy, so as to build a transportation network with modern tools as the mainstay and reaching out in all directions throughout the country within a relatively short period of time, along with the development of industrial and agricultural production and the industrialization of the country.

    高举总路线的红旗　加速发展交通事业
    交通部部长　王首道
    十年来，公路通车里程增加了四倍多；内河通航里程增加了一倍多；民用航空线已达三万三千公里
    在新中国光荣的十年中，我国交通运输工作者，和全国人民一道，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助下，以“让高山低头、河水让路”的英雄气概，取得了辉煌的成就。
    在旧中国，从1913年中国第一条公路——湖南长沙到湘潭的公路诞生到1948年，三十六年间，共修了十三万公里公路，平均每年只修三千六百公里。解放初期，由于许多公路在国民党溃败、逃窜时遭受破坏和年久失修，全国公路通车里程只有七万五千公里。而截至1958年底，我国公路通车里程已达四十万公里，也就是平均每年增加三万二千多公里公路。特别是新中国的筑路英雄们，在毛主席“为了帮助各兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路”的伟大号召下，劈开了奇峰峭壁，穿过了雪山戈壁，在世界屋脊上修通了康藏、青藏、新藏等著名的公路。解放前，全国汽车货运量每年最多只有八百一十九万吨，1958年我国汽车货运量已达一亿七千六百三十万吨。
    我国河流纵横，海岸线很长，有充分发展水运的条件。但是，解放初期全国内河通航里程只有七万三千多公里。而到1958年，我国内河通航里程已达十五万公里。特别是在号称天险的长江上游，已经可以夜航。结合水利建设，许多平原地区正在进行河网化的建设，有些山区和沙漠地区也扬起了白帆。此外，还修建了湛江、裕溪口等现代化港口，在从北京到杭州的南北大运河上，也开始了巨大的整修工程。从1872年招商局成立起，全国轮驳船货运量解放前最多的年份只有一千二百六十四万吨，而1958年我国轮驳船货运量已达七千六百三十六万吨。
    国民党反动派时期，我国的民用航空完全被帝国主义国家所操纵。解放后，我国民用航空部门在几乎是白手起家的情况下，建立了我国独立自主的民用航空事业。截至1958年，民用航空航线里程已达三万三千公里，特别是还迅速发展了工业运输、航空摄影、物理探矿、地质勘察、消灭农作物病虫害、护林防火、森林调查和撒播树种等直接为工农业生产服务的航空业务。
    十年来，特别是在1958年人民公社化和大跃进中，新中国交通运输业所取得的巨大成就，是旧中国交通运输业所望尘莫及的。
    “往上看，一缕天，往下看，白河滩，
    不是背来就是担，累得腰痛又腿酸。
                    ×　×　×
    吃糠又咽菜，出入无衣衫，
    一脚不小心，尸首找不见。”
    这是在旧中国许多山区人民慨叹交通不便的山歌。但是，中国人民站起来了，唱这样悲惨的山歌的时代已经一去不复返了。现在响彻云霄的，是对党、对毛主席、对新的生活、新的交通条件的歌颂：
    “平地春雷一声响，太阳照到高山上。
    千年深山劈开路，万代河上白帆扬。
    歌唱英明的毛主席，歌唱伟大的共产党。
    我们向您作保证，多运钢铁多运粮。”
    对资本主义运输业和个体运输业的社会主义改造取得巨大的胜利
    十年来我国交通运输业所取得的巨大成就，是党在过渡时期的总路线和党的社会主义建设总路线在交通运输战线上的胜利。
    解放初期，在整个交通运输业中，国营经济成份所占的比重还很小；而在它的两翼，私营资本主义运输业占有相当大的比重，个体运输更是为数众多。当时，私营轮船载重吨占全国轮船载重吨的57％，私营汽车占全国营业汽车总数的75％；个体木帆船数达三百一十多万吨，个体畜力车达数十万辆。这是一个庞大复杂、分布辽阔的运输阵地。在这里资本主义和社会主义谁战胜谁的问题是明摆着的。党曾经不断地教导说，在过渡时期，不仅要抓紧对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，而且要同时抓紧对私营资本主义运输业和个体运输业的社会主义改造。因为交通运输业是国民经济的一个极为重要的组成部分。社会主义不仅要在工业和农业部门取得胜利，而且也必须在沟通着工业和农业的交通运输部门取得胜利。
    根据党的这一指示，全国交通运输部门在各级党委的领导下，在巩固和扩大国营运输力量的同时，对资本主义运输业实行了利用、限制和改造的政策，对它们进行了统筹安排，实行了“三统”政策（即统一运价、统一货源、统一调度），并且用编组编队或联营的办法，加强了对企业和资本家的改造。在1955年底和1956年初，随着全国农业合作化高潮和资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮的到来，我国资本主义运输业实行了全行业公私合营，并在进行经济改组时，根据车船流动性的特点，大部分和国营运输业实行了统一经营。
    在对资本主义运输业进行社会主义改造的同时，对个体运输业也进行了社会主义改造。解放后，党领导个体运输业者摧垮了封建把头制度，接着，各地交通运输部门又对他们不断地进行集体主义教育，帮助他们自觉自愿地组成互助组或互助队，组织运输合作社，使他们根据自己的经验，认识合作化道路的优越性。从而，在1955年底和1956年初的社会主义改造高潮中，个体运输业顺利地走上了社会主义的康庄大道。木帆船运输业组成了近三千个运输合作社，兽力车运输业组成了近二千个合作社。个体运输业合作化后的第一年，木帆船运输效率就比单干时平均提高了14.7％，社员收入增加15％；兽力车运输效率比单干时提高46％，社员收入增加33.6％。
    交通运输大跃进是由交通建设、群众运输和技术革新技术革命等三个方面的群众运动组成的
    在恢复国民经济和第一个五年计划时期，公路、水运和民用航空事业都有了很大的发展；但是，广大人民要求更快地改变交通事业的落后面貌，加快建设速度。特别是党提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线之后，更加激起了六亿五千万人民建设社会主义的热情，全国工农业生产立即以雷霆万钧之势，一日千里之速，奔腾跃进。广大人民要求加快交通建设速度的心情，更为迫切。他们说：“推广社会主义的农具，必须改变封建时代的道路”。党在八大二次会议所提出的技术革命的任务中，也号召要“在全国范围内建立一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的运输网”。形势迫使交通运输部门必须和工农业一齐跃进，促进生产的发展。
    为了适应这个形势，各级交通部门和广大交通干部，对党的社会主义建设总路线进行了深入的学习，批判了在某些交通干部中存在的忽视政治挂帅、片面地强调垂直领导和业务领导，忽视贯彻群众路线、片面地强调依靠专业队伍和专门技术人材以及忽视普及、盲目追求高标准和现代化的所谓“直、专、高”的指导思想。明确地提出了依靠各级地方党委领导，依靠广大群众和广大职工，实行普及和提高相结合，而目前以普及为主的“地、群、普”的指导思想。这样，就进一步激发了交通战线上广大群众和广大职工的劳动热情，随着人民公社运动和全民炼钢铁运动的展开，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的交通运输大跃进运动。
    交通运输大跃进是由交通建设、群众运输和技术革新与技术革命等三个方面的群众运动组成的。在交通建设运动中，广大群众在“小忙大干、大忙小干、不忙突击”的口号下，热火朝天地兴修道路、疏浚河道、修筑机场、大造车船。在群众办运输运动中，为了赶运钢铁、煤炭和农副产品，各级交通部门除了调动各种现代运输工具参加运输外，还在当地党委的领导下，在广大农村发动各人民公社抽调了各种各样的民间运输工具，组成运输连、运输营或运输团参加运输。在城市则发动了市民、机关干部和学生参加短途搬运。有些省还积极开辟了地方民用航空线，运送工人、干部和紧急物资。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，在广大农村展开了一个广泛的改变肩挑背负的运输方式的群众运动，在平原地区和较平坦地段大搞车子化和轨道化；在有河流可通的地方，大搞船运化；在山区、丘陵地带以及有坡度可利用的地方，大搞索道化和溜槽化。在车、船运输合作社和各种现代化运输企业中，为了充分挖掘运输潜力，也广泛地开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。当时，每一个地区都有成千上万的交通建设队伍，在每一条运输线上都是浩浩荡荡的运输大军，在每一个运输企业，都可以看到琳琅满目的群众创造，这真是一幅史无前例的交通运输大跃进的壮丽图景。
    在交通事业大跃进的1958年中，新建公路达十五万公里（其中简易公路约十四万公里），相当于第一个五年计划期间增加公路里程的一倍以上；整治和新增内河航道一万公里，相当于第一个五年计划期间整治航道里程的两倍；新辟地方民用航空线十九条。1958年公路、水运、民用航空所完成的总货运量较1957年增加50％（剔除机关企业自运自货部分）。
    1959年交通战线经过对群众建设和运输队伍进行短期的整顿之后，又继续跃进。特别是根据党的号召，展开了以增产节约为中心的红旗竞赛运动，从而在1958年大跃进的基础上，又取得了巨大的成就。今年上半年，公路、水运、民航货运量比去年同期增加73％，在基本建设方面，除了对去年的公路、航道进行整修提高外，又新修了不少公路，开辟了不少航道，特别是对上海、天津、汉口等十二个港口，进行了大规模的扩建。
      人民公社提供了巨大的运输和交通建设潜力
    交通事业的大跃进，使交通战线的广大群众更深刻地认识了党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大和正确，并取得了极其丰富的多快好省地发展我国交通运输事业的经验。
    交通事业大跃进的经验，首先证明了实现人民公社化以后的五亿农民，是我国进行交通建设的基本力量，由于人民公社的组织规模大，活动范围广，可以兴办高级农业生产合作社所难以兴办的交通建设，可以使工农交商密切结合；可以安排一部分运力专门担任运输任务；可以加速实行运输的机械化和半机械化，正是由于人民公社给交通运输带来了这些有利条件，才提供了巨大的运输和交通建设潜力。以公路运输事业为例，在1958年新增的十五万公里公路中，就有约十万公里是人民公社修建的；大办钢铁和农业丰产运动中的短途运输任务，也大部分是靠人民公社的运输力量完成的。
    大跃进的经验证明，人民公社办运输（其中包括修建道路、开辟航道、道路养护等，下同）的好处很多。人民公社有了便利的交通运输条件，就可以便利农业机械和新式农具的推广，保证及时施肥、耕种和收割，节省了劳动力；就可以及时运入肥料、种子、农具和各种工业用品，及时运出农副产品，发展公社的商业，并促进农林牧副渔各业的发展。此外，人民公社办运输还可以增加公社的副业收入。人民公社的交通运输是整个国家交通运输的重要组成部分。人民公社内部交通条件改善，运输力量加强以后，不但可以使国家交通运输部门腾出手来，集中完成干线和重要支线的运输任务，而且在国家需要的时候，还可以抽调一部分力量支援干线和支线。因此，为了加速发展我国的交通运输事业，应该放手地让人民公社办运输，充分发挥五亿农民对交通建设的积极性和创造性。
      实行现代化运输工具和民间运输工具并举
    交通事业大跃进的经验还证明，它同样要贯彻党的两条腿走路的方针。而在交通事业中实行两条腿走路，最重要的就是要实行现代化运输工具和民间运输工具并举。现代化的运输工具拉得多，跑得快，运得远，成本低，是交通事业的骨干力量。但是，它们的数量还很少，只能担负干线和重要支线的任务。它们的这一缺点，正需要数量大、分布广的民间运输工具来补充。我国是一个农业的大国，在国民经济发展中必须实行工业和农业同时并举，特别在五亿农民走上了人民公社化的道路以后，农林牧副渔各业都在飞速跃进。我国的工业发展，也是实行重工业和轻工业、中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举。各种工厂星罗棋布地分布在全国各地。国民经济的这些特点，反映到交通运输事业上，就是短途运输量日益增长。这就要求交通事业深入到各个经济区域和最小的货物产地，面向广大农村和工矿区，满足五亿农民和广大中小型企业的生产和生活的需要。而交通事业只有实行现代运输工具和民间运输工具同时并举，才能适应国民经济发展的这一特点。
    实行现代化运输工具和民间运输工具同时并举，不仅在运输上要统筹兼顾，而且要有一系列的相应的建设方针。譬如，在公路方面，不仅要修干线公路，而且要修适合地方民间运输工具使用的简易公路、大车路、驮运道等。在水运方面，不仅要疏浚大河大江，而且要开发支流小河；不仅要建设大港，而且要建设中小港口。在车船装卸和修理上，不仅要有洋机械，也要有土机械。一句话，两条腿走路，是我国整个交通运输高速度发展的必由之路。
      在现代化运输企业中，也必须大搞群众运动
    交通事业大跃进的经验还证明，在各种现代化的运输企业中，也必须大搞群众运动。过去由于有些领导干部片面地强调现代化运输调度的集中性、运行的安全性和机件的精密性，强调由上至下的行政管理和规章制度，而不敢放手发动群众；由于有些领导干部和技术干部，存在官僚主义的毛病，不能深入线路上去和工人打成一片，及时采纳工人的合理化建议，解决工人所提出的问题，有些规章制度也不尽合理，因此，在各种现代化运输企业中，缺乏轰轰烈烈的群众运动。有一些群众性的社会主义竞赛也是时断时续，忽冷忽热，广大工人群众的生产积极性并没有充分发挥出来。在大跃进中，各种现代化的运输企业经过推行“干部参加劳动、工人参加管理、改革不合理的规章制度、实行领导人员、技术人员和工人群众相结合”的办法，充分发挥了广大职工的积极性和创造性以后，解决了许多从来没得到解决的大问题。譬如长江航运局，自从推行顶推运输的先进经验以后，由于船队加长，挡住了推轮驾驶的视线，造成驾驶操作上的困难，影响推进队形的进一步发展。过去虽然作过不少努力，但终因只在少数技术人员中打圈子，没有充分发动群众，而未能彻底解决。在大跃进中，这个局的601号轮机长张金海同志在党的领导下，依靠群众，苦战四十天，终于试制成功了“远距离电动驾驶集中操纵仪”，后来在这个基础上又制成了比较完备的“可移式船舶驾驶集中装置”。在推广以后，群众又根据不同类型的柴油机动力船舶，创造出各种不同结构的驾驶集中装置。目前长江已经有60％的船舶安装了这种装置。民用航空局由于在大跃进中开展了群众性的技术革新运动，伊尔—14型飞机停厂修理日数比1957年缩短88％。这些事例都生动地说明，只有大搞群众运动，把广大工人群众的积极性和创造性充分发挥出来，才能更好地完成运输任务。
    交通事业大跃进的实践，进一步丰富了“地、群、普”的交通建设方针的内容。把上述这些大跃进的经验概括起来，就可以将“地、群、普”的交通建设方针的基本点表述如下：在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，坚决依靠各级地方党委的领导，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，充分发挥广大群众和广大职工的积极性和创造性，实行中央运输企业和地方运输企业并举，现代化运输工具和民间运输工具并举，现代化修理和装卸机械和各种简易的修理和装卸机械并举，使干线运输和支线运输，长途运输和短途运输相结合，使普及和提高相结合，而目前以普及为主，使水陆空各种运输方式综合发展，使交通运输同农、林、水利等综合利用，做到工农交商并举、产运供销结合，以高速度发展交通事业，尽快地建成我国以现代工具为主的四通八达的运输网，更好地为工农业生产、广大人民和国防建设服务。
    只有反掉右倾思想，才能贯彻党的总路线，高速度发展交通事业
    国内外反动派看到交通事业在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了巨大的胜利，因而惊恐万状，狺狺狂吠。有些右倾机会主义分子，为了要否定建设社会主义的总路线，否定全民大办钢铁、大办水利、农业增产和人民公社化运动所取得的巨大成就，他们也对我国这次空前的轰轰烈烈的交通建设运动进行恶毒的攻击。在交通战线上也有少数同志存在着严重的右倾思想。这些同志过低估计甚至否定交通事业大跃进的巨大成就，夸大工作中的某些缺点和错误。他们经常散布松劲、泄气、埋怨、悲观的情绪，向群众和干部泼冷水。为了使交通事业循着党的社会主义建设总路线，继续飞速跃进，对于这种右倾思想，必须严加驳斥，彻底批判。
    在交通事业的大跃进中，在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，出现了一种崭新的运输秩序。中央、省、市、专、县以及许多人民公社都由党委和政府主管交通运输工作的负责同志挂帅，组织了产运销各有关部门共同参加的强有力的运输指挥部，按季按月按旬甚至按日地按照物资的缓急轻重安排运输次序；按照各种运输工具的能力和特点，分配运输任务；并负责组织各运输部门和物资部门以及各种不同运输工具之间的分工和协作。最近各级运输指挥部更在总结大跃进的经验的基础上，实行了统一计划，统一运价，统一货源，克服了个别地区曾经在短时间发生过的运价高低不一和争好线、争好货的现象。并且确定了使经常运输和突击运输、专业运输力量和群众运输力量密切结合的调度原则。在大跃进中，在各个运输现场，广大群众也建立了新的运输秩序。如对机动车和非机动车划分行驶路线，实行专线运输；在运输繁忙的路线设立民办交通警察等。特别是许多运输部门在当地党委的领导下，打破了本位主义，实行了厂矿、铁路、港口、轮船和货主的“一条龙”的运输大协作，发展了水陆联运，丰富了运输组织学的内容。这是一种最有利于大跃进，最有利于完成运输任务，最有利于发挥运输效率的新的运输秩序。但是，有些具有右倾思想的人，却认为交通事业的大跃进，搞乱了运输秩序。他们不了解运输秩序有两种，一种是只由专业运输部门办运输的冷冷清清的运输秩序，一种是用群众运动的方法完成运输任务的轰轰烈烈的运输秩序。他们所说的被打乱了的运输秩序，就是那种冷冷清清的运输秩序，这种运输秩序是不能满足工农业生产大跃进对运输的需要的。所谓“搞乱了运输秩序”的论调，实质上是反对在交通战线上大搞群众运动。
    在轰轰烈烈的大搞交通建设的群众运动中，广大群众在制造简易工具和修建简易道路中，创造了许多值得专家们吸取的宝贵经验。例如河北省赤城县有条巴图营黑河，在大跃进中，当地群众在党委领导下，就地取材，修建了一座长八十五米、宽六米的石拱桥，修得又坚固又美观，平均每米造价只六百八十元（一般石拱桥每米造价需要两千元左右），群众称之为东风桥。凡是去实地看过这座桥的公路技术人员，都感到惊佩。但是，有些具有右倾思想的人却说，“高产就不能优质，优质就不能高产”，认为在大跃进中搞起来的交通建设许多是“粗制滥造”的。在1958年中，广大群众所修的简易公路，开发的支流小河，制造的简易车船和机械，确实不如高级公路和干线航道好，不如现代化的车船和机械好，但是，它们是我国农村人民公社化和工业遍地开花的客观需要。在1958年有75％的公路运量和66％的水运运量，就是用这种简易的民间运输工具和通过这些简易公路和小河航道完成的。至于农业田间运输、水利工地运输、人民公社以及各钢铁煤炭联合基地的内部运输，所使用的各种土造的简易运输工具（包括土轨道、滑道、溜槽、土车子等），更是无法和现代化的工具相比拟。但是，没有这些简易的运输工具，没有这些简易道路和支流小河，就不可能完成钢铁战线和农业战线上迅速增长的运输任务。而且，绝不能把质量和标准混为一谈。我们需要简易的工具和道路，按照这种简易工具和道路的规格，制造和建设起来，投入运输，这就是合乎质量要求。不能用那些高级的现代化的道路和工具的标准去衡量它们。具有右倾思想的人说大跃进中的交通建设是“粗制滥造”，实际上是反对按照我国的客观需要和财力、物力的可能，修建简易道路和民间运输工具。当然，在大跃进初期，有些地方还没有经验，交通运输部门的技术指导工作还没有跟上去，反掉了旧的保守的技术标准之后，新的技术标准还没有建立起来，只是在这样的时候，确实有些建设和制造忽视了质量。但是当技术指导工作跟了上去，新的技术标准建立了起来，特别是根据已有经验，进行质量鉴定和产品定型之后，一些忽视质量的现象，迅速得到了克服。具有右倾思想的人，所以要夸大我们已经纠正了的这些顶多不过是“一个指头”的缺点，并不是真正关心交通建设的质量，而是不同意党的两条腿走路的方针。
    在交通事业的大跃进中，经过改进劳动组织和进行技术革新之后，用群众运动的方法搞起来的交通建设大多是符合多快好省的原则的。例如我们前边所说的赤城的石拱桥就是一个例证。在大跃进中，山西省开辟太原到长治的地方民用航空线也是一个例子。这条航线从修建机场，安装通讯导航设备，到正式开航，前后历时不到二十天。在修建长治机场时，群众热情洋溢，以亲自参加修建自己家乡的机场为光荣。他们不但日夜苦干，而且想了很多办法，为国家节约了80％的修建费。这里还应该特别指出，这种群众性的交通建设运动，不仅能多快好省，而且能够迅速地培养技术人员。例如广东省五华县在1958年交通事业大跃进中，不但修了二百七十五公里公路、三座二百米以上的大木桥和许多涵洞、地方道路，而且用党委书记、技术人员、人民公社社员三结合和办训练班的办法，培养了初级技术人员三百二十六人，技工五百三十六人。群众办运输的运费比现代运输工具高一些是事实。但是，由于有了群众运输运动，有了现代化运输工具和民间运输工具同时并举，而满足了农村人民公社化和工业遍地开花的运输需要，这是有得无失的。以公路运输为例，1958年群众运输的货物，若全部用汽车来运，需要新增几万部汽车。即使有了汽车，也还需要公路，需要相应的保养修理设备。我们是等待汽车，影响工农业生产合算呢？还是多支出一些运费，保证工农业生产需要合算呢？这是很清楚的一笔大账。而且，群众运输队伍随着劳动组织的整顿和技术革新与技术革命运动的开展，劳动力已大为节约，成本也在不断降低。如人民公社的运输队伍在建立了专业队伍，实行了三包（包任务、包质量、包收入）、五定（定人员、定工具、定载重、定里程、定支出）的办法以后，都成倍地减少了车辆和劳动力，完成的运输任务比过去还多。江苏省常州市在大跃进初期，全市动员四万人搞市内搬运，后来因为整顿了劳动组织，建立了制度，特别是用工具武装了群众运输队伍以后，全市经常性的群众运输队伍减少了90％。具有右倾思想的人，为什么完全不看这些事实，而硬说交通事业的大跃进是“人海战术”，是“浪费人力、物力”呢？
    我国是一个“一穷二白”的国家，我们在工作中是不可能没有困难的。但是，正因为有困难，我们才要坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，才要鼓足干劲、力争上游。我们也正是在大跃进中，在大搞群众运动中，找出了许多克服困难的办法。譬如，许多地方用大闹车船拖带化的办法，实现了“一车当两车”，“一船当两船”的口号，充分挖掘了运输潜力。许多地方用大力整修废旧配件、材料和就地取材、适当利用代用品的办法，开辟了许多新的材料来源。许多地方为了缩短车船和飞机的修理时间，克服修理能力不足的困难，创造了快速修理法。类似事例，不胜枚举。大跃进的实践生动地证明，我们遇到的任何的困难都是前进中的困难，只要苦干、实干、巧干，任何困难都不能阻碍我们胜利前进。但是，有些具有右倾思想的人，见物不见人，只看到客观困难，看不到人的主观能动性。他们借口计划落实，而无止境地降低计划指标，甚至说，“计划落实就是能完成多少算多少”。他们不是鼓足干劲，力争上游，斗志昂扬，生气勃勃，而是怨天尤人，畏缩不前。这种畏难情绪假若占了上风，我们的事业不但不能跃进，而且会寸步难行。
    总之，右倾思想已经成为当前交通战线上的主要危险。不反掉这些右倾思想，交通事业就不能深入贯彻党的总路线，就不能高速度发展，就不能继续跃进。目前，交通战线上的广大职工，正在深入地学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议，反右倾，鼓干劲，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，掀起新的生产高潮，努力在今年完成第二个五年计划的总运输量指标，用新的成绩纪念伟大的建国十周年，用实际行动回击国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子的造谣污蔑。
    当然，我国交通战线上的广大职工并不满足于已有的成就。我们知道，十年来交通建设的成就纵然很大，但还没有根本改变我国交通落后的面貌，赶不上工农业生产高速度发展的需要。因此，摆在我们面前的任务还十分艰巨。我们必须更高地举起总路线的红旗，在十年来已取得的巨大成就的基础上乘胜前进。让国内外反动派和右倾机会主义分子们向隅而泣吧！我们一定会在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，在继续贯彻党的社会主义建设的总路线过程中，在开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，取得更大的成就，从而在较短的期间内，随着工农业生产的发展，和国家工业化的发展，在全国范围内建成一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的运输网。
