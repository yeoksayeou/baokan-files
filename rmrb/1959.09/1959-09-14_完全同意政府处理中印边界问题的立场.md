    Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Resolution of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Sino-Indian Border Issue
    (Adopted at the Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress on September 13, 1959)
    The Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress on September 13, 1959, unanimously approved Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Sino-Indian border issue and fully agreed with the government's position, attitude, and policies in handling the Sino-Indian border issue.
    The Chinese government has consistently maintained that China and India should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, and, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultation in a prepared and step-by-step manner. Prior to this, as a temporary measure, both sides should maintain the long-existing status quo, and should not change this situation through unilateral actions, let alone use of force. For some disputes, partial and temporary agreements can also be reached through negotiations to ensure the tranquility of the border and maintain the friendship between the two countries. This position and policy express the firm will of the people of the whole country to defend the sacred territory of the motherland and the sincere desire to safeguard Sino-Indian friendship.
    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress expresses regret over a series of incidents in recent times in which Indian troops have invaded Chinese territory and the anti-China movement instigated by some right-wing politicians in India, hoping that the Indian side can promptly withdraw from the invaded locations, cease anti-China agitation, and begin friendly negotiations with China to peacefully resolve the border issue.
    Western imperialist forces and their agents in India are trying to use the Sino-Indian border incident to undermine the great friendship between China and India and to change India's peaceful and neutral foreign policy. The Chinese people eagerly hope that the Indian people can overcome their malicious conspiracies in order to safeguard the common interests of the Indian people, the Chinese people, and the people of other Asian countries.
    China and India have a long history of friendly relations, are the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have common interests and responsibilities in maintaining world peace, especially Asian peace. We believe that through the friendly efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, the differences between the two countries on the border issue can be reasonably resolved based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the desire for mutual friendship, thereby defeating the conspiracies of the common enemies of the two countries and consolidating the great friendship between the two countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Chairman Zhu De spoke today at the conclusion of the enlarged eighth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress. He said: "The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Sino-Indian border issue. After three days of serious and earnest discussion, everyone unanimously agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's report and agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on September 8. The meeting firmly supports the solemn position, clear attitude, and correct policy of our government in resolving the Sino-Indian border issue, believing that this position, attitude, and policy fully reflect the firm will of the 600 million Chinese people to safeguard our country's territorial sovereignty from infringement and fully demonstrate our country's sincere desire to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in peacefully resolving the Sino-Indian border issue and safeguarding Sino-Indian friendship."
    Chairman Zhu De said: "The Sino-Indian border issue is a complex problem left over by the long-term aggression of British imperialism against our Tibet. The so-called McMahon Line is a product of British imperialism's aggression against our Tibet. Before liberation, successive Chinese governments, including the Beiyang warlord government and the Kuomintang government, never recognized it. Considering the historical background of the Sino-Indian border issue and the actual situation that the border between the two countries has never been formally demarcated, our government has consistently advocated a comprehensive solution to the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations based on the Five Principles. In order to safeguard Sino-Indian friendship, our troops and administrative personnel have not crossed this so-called McMahon Line before the governments of both sides have resolved and demarcated the border issue. The good intentions of the Chinese government have not been understood by the Indian government. Today's facts, as everyone has said, are that Indian troops have invaded China, not that Chinese troops have invaded India; it is certain people in India who have undermined the Five Principles, undermined Sino-Indian friendship, and created tension on the border, not China. These are clear facts that no one can deny."
    Chairman Zhu De concluded by saying: "China and India are both large countries. The friendship and unity of the people of the two countries are of great significance for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, imperialism is always painstakingly trying to undermine the friendship and unity between China and India. The anti-China movement that has been stirred up in India today can only benefit imperialism and is not conducive to the people of China and India. We hope that Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government will prioritize Sino-Indian friendship, immediately correct the extremely erroneous practices of exerting pressure on our country militarily, diplomatically, and through public opinion, and immediately stop all anti-China clamoring aimed at undermining Sino-Indian friendship and undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We believe that as long as the Sino-Indian border dispute can be resolved completely through peaceful consultation based on the Five Principles, "

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会讨论关于中印边界问题的扩大会议，从11日到13日举行，在三次扩大会议上发言的共有五十九人。
    新华社13日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于中印边界问题的决议
    （1959年9月13日第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八次会议通过）
    1959年9月13日第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八次会议一致批准周恩来总理关于中印边界问题的报告，并且完全同意政府处理中印边界问题的立场、态度和方针。
    中国政府一贯主张，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。在此以前，作为临时性的措施，双方应该维持久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动，更不应该使用武力改变这种状况；对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判达成局部性和临时性的协议，以保证边界的安宁，维护两国的友谊。这个立场和方针，表达了全国人民对保卫祖国神圣疆土的坚强意志和维护中印友谊的真诚愿望。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会对于最近时期印度军队侵入中国领土的一系列事件和印度国内一些右翼政客煽动的反华运动表示遗憾，希望印度方面能够迅速撤出入侵的地点，停止反华煽动，并且同中国开始和平解决边界问题的友好谈判。
    西方帝国主义势力及其在印度的代理人正在力图利用中印边界事件破坏中印两国的伟大友谊，力图改变印度的和平中立的外交政策。中国人民热切盼望印度人民能够战胜他们的这种恶毒的阴谋，以便保卫印度人民、中国人民和亚洲其他各国人民的共同利益。
    中印两国具有历史悠久的友好关系，是和平共处五项原则的倡导者，在维护世界和平，特别是亚洲和平方面，有共同的利益和责任。我们相信，通过两国政府和人民的友好的努力，两国之间关于边界问题的分歧，必能根据和平共处五项原则和互相友好的愿望，得到合理的解决，从而击破两国共同敌人的阴谋，使两国的伟大友谊得到巩固。
    新华社13日讯　朱德委员长今天在第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大的第八次会议结束时讲了话。他说：“全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议听取了周恩来总理关于中印边界问题的报告，经过三天认真的、严肃的讨论，大家发言一致同意周恩来总理的报告，同意9月8日周恩来总理给印度尼赫鲁总理的复信。会议坚决支持我国政府对于解决中印边界问题所持的严正立场、明确态度和正确方针，认为这种立场、态度和方针，充分反映了中国六亿人民维护我国领土主权不受侵犯的坚强意志，充分表现了我国坚持按照五项原则和平解决中印边界问题、维护中印友谊的真诚愿望。”
    朱德委员长说：“中印边界问题是英帝国主义长期侵略我国西藏所遗留下来的一个复杂问题。所谓麦克马洪线就是英帝国主义侵略我国西藏的产物，解放以前，中国历届政府包括北洋军阀政府和国民党政府，都从未承认过。我国政府考虑到中印两国边界问题的历史背景，考虑到两国边界过去从未正式划定过的实际情况，一贯主张根据五项原则，通过友好协商方法，全面解决两国边界问题。为了维护中印友谊，在双方政府对边界问题没有解决和划定以前，我国的军队和行政人员都没有越过这条所谓麦克马洪线。中国政府这种好心好意，却没有为印度政府所了解。今天的事实，正如大家所说的，是印度军队侵入了中国，而不是中国军队侵入了印度；是印度的某些人破坏了五项原则、破坏了中印友谊、制造了边境的紧张局势，而不是中国。这是明明白白的事实，是任何人否定不了的。”
    朱德委员长最后说：“中印两国都是大国，两国人民的友好和团结，对于保卫亚洲和世界和平具有重要意义，因此帝国主义总是在处心积虑地破坏中印两国之间的友谊和团结。今天在印度掀起的反华运动，只能有利于帝国主义，而不利于中印两国人民。我们希望尼赫鲁总理和印度政府以中印友谊为重，立即纠正从军事、外交和舆论等方面对我国施加压力的极端错误作法，立即制止一切旨在破坏中印友谊、破坏和平共处五项原则的反华叫嚣。我们相信，只要根据五项原则，通过和平协商，中印边界纠纷是一定能够得到完满的解决的。”
