Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: It was officially announced here that the governments of France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States recently reached an agreement on the establishment of a disarmament problem review committee. It was also agreed that the participating countries in the disarmament committee would be the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Bulgaria, Italy, Canada, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, if all the aforementioned countries agree to do so.

The Four-Power Joint Communiqué stated that the establishment of the Disarmament Committee would not diminish the responsibilities of the United Nations in this regard, nor would it be an infringement on the powers of the United Nations. In the establishment of the Disarmament Committee, it is noteworthy that the major powers bear a special responsibility in determining the basis of the agreement.

The communiqué continued that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States consider this committee to be an effective tool for exploring ways to make progress on the following issues through mutual consultation: reaching agreements and making recommendations on the limitation and reduction of all types of armaments and armed forces and the establishment of effective international supervision, where the limitation and reduction of all types of armaments and armed forces can primarily and directly involve the countries participating in the discussions. The four governments hope that the results achieved in this discussion process can provide a favorable basis for the United Nations to discuss disarmament issues.

The communiqué stated that the four governments have reached an agreement: the committee will submit its work reports to the United Nations Disarmament Commission and, through it, to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. The four governments request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene a meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in September of this year so that the members of the commission can fully understand the nature and purpose of the Disarmament Problem Review Committee. The four governments hope that the committee will begin its work in Geneva in early 1960.

    苏美英法四国政府达成协议
    由十国组成裁军审查委员会
    据新华社7日讯　塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：此间正式公布，法国、英国、苏联和美国四国政府最近就建立裁军问题审查委员会一事达成协议，并且还商定：裁军委员会的参加国将有苏联、联合王国、美国、法国、保加利亚、意大利、加拿大、波兰、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克，如果上述所有国家都同意这样做的话。
    四国联合公报中说，裁军委员会的建立丝毫也不减少联合国在这方面的责任，也不是对联合国职权的侵犯。在建立裁军委员会一事上，值得注意的是大国在确定协议基础方面所承担的特殊责任。
    公报接着说，苏联、联合王国、法国和美国四国政府认为这个委员会是一个通过互相磋商的途径来探讨如何在下列问题上取得进展的有效工具。这些问题是：就限制和缩减一切类型的军备和军队并建立有效的国际监督达成协议和提出建议，而限制和缩减一切类型的军备和军队一事可以首先直接涉及参加讨论的国家。四国政府希望在这个讨论过程中达成的结果能为联合国讨论裁军问题提供一个有利的基础。
    公报说，四国政府已经达成协议：委员会将向联合国裁军委员会并通过它向联合国大会和安全理事会提出自己的工作报告。四国政府请求联合国秘书长在今年9月份召集联合国裁军委员会会议，以便委员会的各位委员能够充分了解裁军问题审查委员会的性质和目的。四国政府希望委员会将于1960年初在日内瓦开始工作。
