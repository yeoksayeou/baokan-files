Small Blast Furnaces Withstand the Test and Become More and More Red
Anhui's Steel Production in the First Eight Months Increased Thirty-Six Times and Five Times Respectively Compared to the Same Period Last Year

(Our Dispatch) "Five thousand eight hundred tons, six thousand one hundred tons, six thousand five hundred tons, six thousand eight hundred tons." Comrades from the Anhui Provincial Industrial Office, flipping through the province's pig iron daily production progress chart, excitedly introduced to the reporter the increase in the province's pig iron production since September. These figures demonstrate the power of the province's small and medium-sized blast furnaces.

From January to August this year, Anhui Province has produced more than 1.15 million tons of pig iron, an increase of five times compared to the same period last year; more than 70,000 tons of steel, an increase of more than thirty-six times compared to the same period last year. Eighty-five thousand tons of iron have been transferred to support Shanghai and other places. The pig iron produced in the first eight months of this year would have taken five years to produce using the production capacity before the Great Leap Forward in 1957. As for steel production, the province was a blank slate in 1957. During the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958, the Party's General Line and the principle of "walking on two legs" were resolutely implemented, mobilizing the masses to make steel in a big way, and rapidly changing the backward situation. After August last year, while combining indigenous and foreign methods of iron smelting, Anhui Province vigorously grasped the construction of small modern blast furnaces, concentrated the province's machinery manufacturing and construction installation forces, and fully utilized the wisdom and revolutionary drive of the masses, overcoming numerous difficulties. In just four months, 1,260 small blast furnaces of eight to twenty-eight cubic meters were built. Last year, these small modern furnaces and the medium-sized blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, together with the small indigenous furnaces, produced more than 1.07 million tons of iron for the country. This year, small blast furnaces completely replaced small indigenous furnaces, and the province used only more than 400 small blast furnaces and a dozen medium-sized blast furnaces to produce, and the pig iron production in eight months exceeded the entire year of last year.

Having iron provides the material conditions for further developing the steel industry. This year, Anhui Province again adopted the method of concentrating the province's mechanical installation forces last year to accelerate the construction speed of steelmaking converters. The province plans to newly build and renovate forty-two three-ton converters this year, of which twenty-eight have been completed and put into production, and the rest will also be put into production soon.

In the past eight months, steelworkers in Anhui Province have overcome various difficulties, enabling small blast furnaces to withstand the tests of severe cold and rainy seasons, improving quality and output. Small blast furnaces have become stronger and stronger, demonstrating vigorous vitality. Next to the medium-sized blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, there is an eight-cubic-meter Red Flag No. 2 blast furnace, with an average utilization coefficient of 2.012 from January to August, a coke ratio reduced to 0.953, a pig iron qualification rate of 97.6%, and a cost of 156.91 yuan per ton. Although the furnace is small, it has highly raised the red flag of high yield, high quality, low consumption, and low cost for small blast furnaces, becoming a model for the entire province to learn from.

In the movement to seize large-scale high-quality and high-yield, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's steel test field—the Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant—proved through more than 100 experiments that small blast furnaces can smelt high-quality iron and can produce iron according to the specifications and varieties required by user units. In July and August, the province's pig iron qualification rate increased from 70% to 83%, with first-class products accounting for 50%. Among them, the pig iron qualification rate in Ma'anshan, Fuyang, Bengbu and other regions reached more than 90%.

### 小高炉历经考验越炼越红  安徽头八个月钢铁产量比去年同期猛增三十六倍和五倍

    小高炉历经考验越炼越红
    安徽头八个月钢铁产量比去年同期猛增三十六倍和五倍
    本报讯　“五千八百吨，六千一百吨，六千五百吨，六千八百吨”。安徽省工业办公室的同志，翻开全省生铁日产进度表，很兴奋地向记者介绍了9月以来全省生铁产量上升情况。这些数字，显示出全省中小型高炉所发挥的威力。
    今年1月至8月，安徽省已生产生铁一百一十五万多吨，比去年同期增长五倍；钢七万多吨，比去年同期增长三十六倍多。已调出铁八十五万吨支援上海等地。今年八个月生产的生铁，若使用大跃进以前1957年的生产能力要生产五年。至于钢的生产，全省在1957年还属空白点。1958年大办钢铁时，坚决贯彻了党的总路线和两条腿走路的方针，发动群众大炼钢铁，迅速改变了落后面貌。去年8月以后，安徽省在土洋结合炼铁的同时，狠狠地抓了小洋高炉的建设工作，集中使用全省的机械制造和建筑安装力量，充分发挥群众的智慧和革命干劲，克服了重重困难，在短短的四个月内就建成了八至二十八立方米小高炉一千二百六十座。去年这些小洋炉和马鞍山钢铁公司的中型高炉，和小土炉共同为国家生产了一百零七万多吨铁。今年小高炉全部代替了小土炉，全省只用了四百多座小高炉和十几座中型高炉生产，在八个月时间内的生铁产量就超过了去年一年。
    有了铁，就为进一步发展钢铁工业提供了物质条件。今年安徽省又采用了去年集中全省机械安装力量的办法，加快炼钢转炉的建设速度，全省今年计划新建改建四十二个三吨转炉，其中已有二十八个建成投入生产，其余也将于最近陆续投入生产。
    今年八个月来，安徽省的钢铁工人克服了种种困难，使小高炉经历了严寒、雨季的考验，提高了质量和产量，小高炉愈战愈强，显示了旺盛的生命力。在马鞍山钢铁公司中型高炉的旁边，有一个八立方米的红旗二号高炉，1到8月的平均利用系数达到二点零一二，焦比降到零点九五三，生铁合格率达到97.6％，每吨成本为一百五十六点九一元。炉子虽小，却高高地举起了小高炉高产、优质、低耗、低成本的红旗，成为全省学习的榜样。
    在夺取大面积优质高产运动中，安徽省委钢铁试验田——省委钢铁厂经过一百多次试验，证明小高炉能够冶炼优质铁，能够按使用单位要求的规格品种出铁，7、8月份，全省生铁合格率由70％提高到83％，一级品占50％。其中马鞍山、阜阳、蚌埠等地区生铁合格率达90％以上。
