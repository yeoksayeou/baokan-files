Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 24th: Harbin City has completed its industrial production plan for the third quarter eight days ahead of schedule. As of September 22nd, the city's total industrial output value plan for the third quarter had been exceeded by 1.3%; the cumulative total industrial output value from January to September 22nd this year increased by 64.6% compared with the total industrial output value from January to September 1958. Production plans for twenty major products, including pig iron, steel, power station boilers, freight cars, automobiles, ball bearings, and measuring tools, were completed ahead of schedule, and quality also improved significantly.

During the third quarter, Harbin City also successfully trial-produced 232 new products, including a 3,000 kW DC motor, a 3,500 mm air volume exhaust fan, a new type of freight car with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour, and various precision and ultra-precision bearings.

The comprehensive leap forward in industrial production in Harbin City during the third quarter is mainly due to the thorough implementation of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party by various factories, overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking among some cadres, strengthening Party leadership, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and launching a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. At the beginning of the movement, a surge of counterpart and opponent competitions emerged between districts, factories, workshops, and individuals. Employees of the Harbin Electric Carbon Factory, Harbin Bearing Factory, and Harbin Wire Factory took the lead in this competition, reaching their main planned targets for the third quarter 39, 28, and 23 days ahead of schedule, respectively. Under their impetus, all factories in the city also quickly caught up. By September 20th, more than 290 factories had completed their third-quarter output value plans more than ten days ahead of schedule.

The mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement is an important factor in ensuring the early completion of the third-quarter plan. According to the 55 key production topics proposed by the entire factory, all employees of the Harbin Boiler Factory boldly innovated and realized 85 innovation projects within 15 days in September. Liang Yande, a model worker in the city, aiming at the key problem of low manual labor efficiency in welding flanges in the past, created the electro-slag welding method with plated electrodes with the help of technicians and veteran workers, increasing efficiency by 15 times. In the first 15 days of September, employees of the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory proposed 369 important rationalization proposals, which was 7% more than the total proposed in August. All workers in the eighth workshop of this factory actively improved tools and fixtures, and in just the first ten days of September, the workshop achieved tooling of parts processing, quality standardization, and part standardization, increasing efficiency by 18 to 96 times.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 24th: Jinan City has completed its third-quarter industrial output value plan nine days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 1.18%, as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the employees of various factories in Jinan City quickly launched a new upsurge in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The socialist labor competition centered on technical innovation and technical revolution to learn from, catch up with, surpass, and help the advanced and backward has been widely launched in various districts and factories. Huaiyin District established more than 600 pacesetters as examples for employees to "learn, compare, and catch up." In the third quarter, the district realized 74 rationalization proposals, which increased production efficiency by more than one time, or even more than one thousand times, and solved many key production problems. For example, employees of the Jinan Pneumatic Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced a mold for the "limiting frame" of the air compressor, which increased work efficiency by 20 times and ensured product quality. Many employees broke through production quotas due to technological innovation.

Leading cadres at all levels in Jinan City have adopted a more in-depth work style, helping employees summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner. Leading cadres of many enterprises have adopted methods of grasping plans by shift, by process, and by machine time, discovering problems and solving them in a timely manner. For example, Jinan Chemical Factory adopted the method of three grasps a day and layer-by-layer inspection, and completed the third-quarter plan ahead of schedule by 20 days.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 24th: Employees on the industrial front in Changsha City presented the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with outstanding achievements in completing the third-quarter industrial production plan nine days ahead of schedule. As of September 21st, the city's total industrial output value plan for the third quarter had been completed by 100.01%; production plans for 16 major products, including steel ingots, AC generators, refractory materials, and rubber shoes, have been overfulfilled. The quality of major products has also improved compared to the second quarter. In addition, the city added 544 kinds of daily industrial products (including handicrafts) in the third quarter, successfully trial-produced 205 new products, and added more than 1,100 new patterns and varieties.

The city's industrial front's achievement of completing the third-quarter plan ahead of schedule is the result of resolutely implementing the Party's general line, opposing right-leaning tendencies, and encouraging hard work. Especially after the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the vast number of cadres and the masses were even more high-spirited and energetic, the mass movement rose day by day, and production indicators rose steadily. The city's output of qualified steel ingots was 1,703 tons in July, 2,429 tons in August, and had reached more than 2,500 tons by September 21st. The city's total industrial output value is also constantly rising, and the total output value in the first two ten-day periods of September alone exceeded the total output value for the entire month of July.

The city's employees enthusiastically launched a campaign for production increases and economies. A total of 292 factories and enterprises and 36 units in the same industry participated in the "one-dragon" counterpart competition, learning from and helping each other in the competition, thereby promoting the advanced to be more advanced and the backward to catch up with the advanced. At the same time, the city's employees proposed and implemented more than 5,870 innovation proposals aimed at key production issues. The implementation of these innovation proposals played a significant role in ensuring the early completion of the quarterly plan.

Now, the city's employees are advancing victoriously and fighting to complete the annual leap forward plan ahead of schedule.

    劲头日日高涨　产量节节上升
    哈尔滨、济南和长沙超额完成三季度工业生产计划
    新华社哈尔滨24日电　哈尔滨市已提前八天完成了第三季度的工业生产计划。到9月22日止，全市第三季度的工业总产值计划已超额1.3％完成；从今年1月到9月22日的累计工业总产值，比1958年1月至9月的工业总产值增长了64.6％。生铁、钢材、电站锅炉、货车、汽车、滚珠轴承、量具刃具等二十种主要产品产量计划都提前完成了，质量也有显著提高。
    在第三季度内，哈尔滨市还试制成功了二百三十二种新产品，其中主要的有三千瓩直流电动机，每分钟风量三千五百毫米的抽风机，时速一百二十公里的新型货车，以及各种精密和超精密的轴承等。
    哈尔滨市第三季度所以在工业生产上取得全面跃进的成就，主要是各工厂认真地贯彻党的八届八中全会的精神，克服某些干部当中的右倾保守思想，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，并且展开了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。运动一开始，区与区、厂与厂、车间与车间、个人与个人之间就出现对口、对手竞赛热潮。哈尔滨电碳厂、哈尔滨轴承厂和哈尔滨电线厂的职工，在这个竞赛中一马当先，他们分别提前三十九天、二十八天和二十三天达到了第三季度的主要计划指标。在他们的带动下，全市各工厂也都急起直追。到9月20日，有二百九十多个工厂提前十天以上完成了第三季度产值计划。
    群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，是保证提前完成第三季度计划的重要因素。哈尔滨锅炉厂全体职工根据全厂提出的五十五项生产关键课题，大胆革新，在9月份十五天的时间内就实现了八十五项革新项目。市劳动模范梁彦德，针对过去焊法蓝用手工劳动效率低的关键，在技术人员和老工人的帮助下，创造了镀极电渣焊接法，提高效率十五倍。哈尔滨林业机械厂的职工，在9月份头十五天就提出重要的合理化建议三百六十九项，比8月份全月提出的还多7％。这个厂八车间的全体工人积极改进工卡具，仅仅在9月上旬的十天中，就使车间达到了零件加工胎模化、质量样板化、零件标准化，提高效率十八倍到九十六倍。
    新华社济南24日电　济南市已提前九天超额1.18％完成第三季度工业产值计划，向建国十周年献礼。
    济南市各工厂职工在党的八届八中全会的号召下，迅速掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮。以技术革新和技术革命为中心的学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进的社会主义劳动竞赛，在各区、各厂普遍展开，槐荫区树立了六百多名标兵，作为职工“学、比、赶”的榜样。全区第三季度实现七十四件合理化建议，分别提高生产效率一倍以上，甚至一千多倍，解决了许多生产关键问题。例如济南风动机械厂职工试制成功空气压缩机“限制框”的模子，使工作效率提高二十倍，并且保证了产品质量。许多职工由于革新技术，纷纷突破了生产定额。
    济南市各级领导干部作风更加深入，及时帮助职工总结和推广先进经验，许多企业的领导干部，采取按班、按工序、按台时抓计划的方法，及时发现问题及时解决。如济南化工厂采取一日三抓层层检查的方法，提前二十天超额完成了第三季度计划。
    新华社长沙24日电　长沙市工业战线职工以提前九天超额完成第三季度工业生产计划的出色成绩，向建国十周年献礼。到9月21日止，全市第三季度的工业总产值计划已完成100.01％；钢锭、交流发电机、耐火材料、胶鞋等十六种主要产品的产量计划，都超额完成了。主要产品的质量，也都比第二季度提高。此外，全市在第三季度增加了五百四十四种日用工业品（包括手工业品），试制成功了二百零五种新产品，增加了一千一百多个花色。
    全市工业战线提前超额完成第三季度计划的成就，是坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。特别是在党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，广大干部和群众更是意气风发，斗志昂扬，群众运动日益高涨，生产指标节节上升。全市合格钢锭产量7月份为一千七百零三吨，8月份为二千四百二十九吨，9月份到21日止已达二千五百多吨。全市工业总产值也是不断上升，9月份仅前两旬就超过7月份全月的总产值。
    全市职工热烈开展了增产节约竞赛运动。全市有二百九十二个工厂企业和三十六个同行业的单位参加了“一条龙”对口竞赛，在竞赛中互相学习、互相帮助，从而推动先进的更先进，落后的赶上先进。同时，全市职工针对生产关键，提出和实现了各种革新建议五千八百七十多条，这些革新建议的实现，对于保证提前完成季度计划起了很大的作用。
    现在，全市职工正在乘胜前进，为提前完成全年的跃进计划而奋战。
