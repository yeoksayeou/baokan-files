Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement on the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council to establish a committee to investigate the situation in Laos. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On September 8th, the United Nations Security Council, disregarding the firm opposition of the Soviet representative, adopted the suggestion made by the US representative to establish a committee to investigate the situation in Laos.

In its telegram to the President of the United Nations Security Council on September 6th, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has already clarified its views regarding the submission of the Lao issue to the United Nations by the Phoui Sananikone government.

Regarding the aforementioned decision made by the United Nations Security Council, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the United Nations Security Council, in adopting the US suggestion, violated the United Nations Charter, especially the principle of unanimity among the five great powers, violated the rules of procedure of the Security Council, and seriously undermined the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos, which were recognized by major powers.

The purpose of the aforementioned resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council is to abolish the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, which is a major component of the Geneva Agreements on Laos.

At a time when the current situation in Laos is becoming extremely serious, when the Lao Foreign Minister and Deputy Defense Minister are in Bangkok intensifying preparations for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's formal armed intervention in Laos, the aforementioned resolution of the United Nations Security Council will encourage US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government to further expand the civil war in Laos, prepare for new wars, seriously threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and undermine peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam opposes the aforementioned resolution of the United Nations Security Council and considers it illegal.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot but express its concern about the new conspiracy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, headed by US imperialism, to directly intervene in Laos.

US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by their actions.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reiterates that the only way to eliminate the current tense situation in Laos is to respect and correctly implement the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and to immediately restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, in order to promptly stop the war-provoking conspiracies of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 8th: The "Lao Patriotic Newspaper," published on September 3rd, strongly condemned the Sananikone government for bringing the Lao issue to the United Nations in order to introduce foreign reactionary troops into Laos to slaughter the Lao people.

The central organ of the Lao Patriotic Front said: "The only way to solve the Lao problem is for the parties concerned—the Lao Kingdom side and the Lao Fighting Units side—to jointly find a solution to peacefully resolve the problem."

The "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" once again pointed out that "the political problem of Laos is a matter for the Lao people, a matter between the Lao Kingdom side and the Lao Fighting Units. This matter must be resolved under the supervision and control of the International Commission in accordance with the Geneva Agreements and the spirit of the agreements signed in Vientiane between the two sides within Laos."

The newspaper said: "In the current situation, although the US imperialists and the Phoui Sananikone clique have tried every possible means to abolish the already signed agreements and undermine national harmony, the Lao Patriotic Front has consistently remained loyal to the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements, adhering to its position, which is: to build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos on the basis of national harmony, and to resolve the Lao issue through peaceful negotiations."

The newspaper pointed out that in the past, when the Lao Fighting Units controlled two entire provinces, the Lao Fighting Units side had peacefully resolved all problems according to the principle of national harmony, making it beneficial to the interests of the nation and in accordance with the wishes of the Lao people. Standing on this firm position, the Lao Fighting Units side is now ready to solve problems through peaceful means if the Lao Kingdom government still shows some concern for the interests of the Lao state and people, and to some extent still hopes for a peaceful resolution of the problem.

The newspaper continued: "The events currently happening in Laos are not related to the United Nations. The United Nations has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos."

The newspaper also said: "As for the reactionaries in the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization group, they have even less right to interfere in the affairs of Laos. If any reactionary group in this group stubbornly sends troops to Laos, the Lao people will regard it as an act of aggression and resolutely resist it."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: Vientiane dispatch: Two US transport planes loaded with grenades and ammunition flew to the Lao capital Vientiane on the 7th.

This is the first batch of weapons provided by the US government to the Phoui Sananikone government to expand the civil war in Laos, according to its decision on August 26th to provide "emergency assistance" to the Phoui Sananikone government. From August 31st, the United States had shipped several batches of Japanese-made military shoes and other military supplies to the Phoui Sananikone government.

The aforementioned actions of the US government seriously violate the provisions of the Geneva Agreements on Laos regarding the prohibition of the entry of new military personnel, weapons, and ammunition into Laos.

According to the Associated Press, the two transport planes were rented by the United States from the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan.

### 越南外交部发表声明指出  安理会决议帮助美萨扩大内战  “老挝爱国报”严正指出联合国无权干涉老挝内政

    越南外交部发表声明指出
    安理会决议帮助美萨扩大内战
    “老挝爱国报”严正指出联合国无权干涉老挝内政
    新华社河内9日电　越南民主共和国外交部今天就联合国安全理事会通过的关于成立一个调查老挝局势的委员会的非法决议发表声明。声明全文如下：
    9月8日，联合国安全理事会不顾苏联代表的坚决反对，通过了美国代表提出的关于成立一个调查老挝局势的委员会的建议。
    越南民主共和国政府在9月6日打给联合国安全理事会主席的电报中，已经就培·萨纳尼空政府把老挝问题提交联合国的问题阐明了它自己的观点。
    对于联合国安全理事会作出的上述决定，越南民主共和国政府认为，联合国安全理事会通过美国的建议，违反了联合国宪章，特别违反了五大国一致的原则，违反了安全理事会的规章，并且严重破坏了得到各大国承认的1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    联合国安全理事会通过的上述决议的目的，在于取消老挝国际监察和监督委员会，而它是关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的主要组成部分。
    在老挝当前局势变得极其严重的时候，当老挝外交大臣和国防副大臣到曼谷加紧为东南亚条约军事集团对老挝正式进行武装干涉进行准备的时候，联合国安全理事会的上述决议将促使美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府进一步扩大老挝内战，准备新的战争，严重威胁越南民主共和国的安全，破坏印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。
    越南民主共和国政府反对联合国安全理事会的上述决议，并且认为它是非法的。
    越南民主共和国政府不能不对以美帝国主义为首的东南亚条约军事集团正在准备直接干涉老挝的新的阴谋表示关切。
    美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府必须对它们的行动所造成的一切后果负完全的责任。
    越南民主共和国政府重申，消除老挝当前紧张局势的唯一途径就是尊重和正确履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，并且立即恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以及时制止美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府的挑起战争的阴谋。
    新华社河内8日电　9月3日出版的“老挝爱国报”强烈谴责萨纳尼空政府把老挝问题提到联合国是要把外国反动军队引入老挝来屠杀老挝人民。
    这家老挝爱国战线党中央机关报说：“解决老挝问题的唯一办法是有关双方——老挝王国方面和寮国战斗部队方面——共同来找出和平解决问题的方案。”
      “老挝爱国报”再一次指出，“老挝的政治问题是老挝人民的事情，是老挝王国方面和寮国战斗部队之间的事情。这件事情必须在国际委员会的监察和监督下根据日内瓦协议和老挝国内双方在万象签署的协议的精神来解决”。
    这家报纸说：“在目前的局势下，虽然美帝国主义者和培·萨纳尼空集团想尽了一切可能的办法来取消已经签订的协议和破坏民族和睦，但是老挝爱国战线党一直继续忠实于日内瓦协议和万象协议，坚守它的立场，这就是：在民族和睦的基础上，建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝，并且通过和平谈判来解决老挝问题”。
    这家报纸指出，在过去，当寮国战斗部队控制着两个全省的时候，寮国战斗部队方面曾经根据民族和睦的原则和平地解决了一切问题，使之有利于民族的利益和符合老挝人民的愿望。寮国战斗部队方面站在这个坚定的立场，现在随时愿意通过和平途径来解决问题，如果老挝王国政府对于老挝国家和人民的利益仍然表现某种关心，并且在某种程度上仍然希望和平解决问题的话。
    这家报纸接着说：“老挝目前发生的事件并不关系到联合国。联合国无权干涉老挝的内政”。
    这家报纸还说：“至于侵略性的东南亚条约组织集团中的反动派，他们更是没有权利干涉老挝的事务。如果这个集团中的任何反动集团顽固地派军队前来老挝，老挝人民将把它视为侵略行为，而且坚决地加以反抗”。
    新华社河内9日电　万象消息：两架装载着手榴弹和弹药的美国运输机在7日飞到老挝首都万象。
    这是美国政府根据它在8月26日作出的关于给予培·萨纳尼空政府以“紧急援助”的决定，供给培·萨纳尼空政府用来扩大老挝内战的第一批武器。从8月31日开始，美国曾经把几批日本制造的军用鞋子和其它军用物资运给培·萨纳尼空政府。
    美国政府的上述行动严重地违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议中关于禁止向老挝运入新的军事人员、武器和弹药的条款。
    据美联社透露，这两架运输机是美国从台湾蒋介石集团那里租来的。
