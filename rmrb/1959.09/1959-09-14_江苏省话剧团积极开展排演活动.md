Jiangsu Provincial Drama Troupe Actively Carries Out Rehearsal Activities

After studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, all the staff of the Jiangsu Provincial Drama Troupe were greatly encouraged. Everyone's enthusiasm was doubled, and they all expressed their willingness to respond to the call of the Party with practical actions, rehearse good plays, and greet the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

At the troupe's general meeting on the morning of August 31, after the troupe leaders announced the work plan for the last four months of this year, everyone was in high spirits and full of enthusiasm, expressing their determination to redouble their efforts to complete and over fulfill this plan with guaranteed quality and quantity.

In the next four months, the Jiangsu Provincial Drama Troupe will process and sort out the three-act, seven-scene thriller "Nameless Island," the report drama "Nursing Home," the classical comedy "Love Affair in the Cabinet," the one-act play "Suzhou Night Talk," and rehearse "Princess Wencheng" as a gift to National Day. In addition, they will also rehearse "The Last Scene" and "The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and other multi-act dramas to be performed in Nanjing.

In addition to rehearsal and sorting, it is planned to perform eighty to one hundred shows in the next four months, equivalent to the performance volume from January to August.

Recently, the Red Flag Propaganda Team of the Jiangsu Provincial Drama Troupe has also been actively engaged, creating and rehearsing skits, comic dialogues, duets, songs and other programs related to the spirit of the Communique and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In addition to drumming and gongs to the streets for publicity performances, they also plan to add performances in front of the curtain in the theater. (Attached picture)
