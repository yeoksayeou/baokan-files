I This Decade

　　Four Surnamed Brothers
　　Liu Yongshun, Commune Member of Yushan Commune, Lantian, Shaanxi

　　Comrade, you want to ask about my family? Such a family is truly rare in the world. Speaking of it, I hate the old society and am grateful for the new society.

　　We now live in Heaoling, Yushan Commune, Lantian County, Shaanxi. Our old home is Xingushu Ao on the eastern plateau of the county. To talk about my family, we have to start with Xingushu Ao.

　　Originally, our family was doing okay. Relying on my wife and me, we could always make ends meet. But the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies of the old society and the bullies made life unbearable. By the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), I was left with nothing! To make a living, my wife and I carried our son, Jiming, down to Hebei (north of the Wei River). There, we rented more than ten mu of land from a landlord. Who knew that just as the crops were planted, the second year brought a severe drought? The soil was scorched, and no grass grew. Nine out of ten families had little to eat. This was the notorious famine of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). The people of Hebei, supporting the old and carrying the young, climbed over the Wei River beach and fled into the southern mountains. My wife and I discussed it, and since we were from near the southern mountains, it was still our hometown, and we could find relatives and friends to turn to. So, we fled back to Lantian together. But at that time, “the poor are ignored on the streets.” Helpless, my wife and I had no choice but to go into the southern mountains to beg for food.

　　Begging for food in Daogouyu, we were at our wits' end when my wife gave birth to our second child. Another mouth to feed only added to the hardship. One day, we were begging in Caojiashan, and it got dark. We ran into a heavy wind and snow, with nowhere to rest. The whole family huddled under the eaves of a restaurant, shivering from the cold. My wife was sick, and the baby had no milk to eat, crying from hunger. Somehow, we moved the restaurant owner, and in the middle of the night, he called our family into the house to stay.

　　It turned out the restaurant owner had a plan. The next day, he said to us, “We poor people are so miserable, always short of food and clothing, but we still keep having children. Now that it's so cold, I don't think you can keep this child alive. There's a couple in Caojiashan named Ye Zhenyou, who are doing well but have no children. Why not give this baby in your arms to them as their son? It'll save the child from suffering…” Children are the flesh of their mother's heart, and my wife cried non-stop when she heard this. But what could we do at that time? So, with tears in our eyes, the whole family gave the baby, who had just passed his "one-month" celebration, to the Ye Zhenyou family. The child was named Ye Xingjin when he arrived at the Ye's.

　　After giving away our second child, we struggled in the southern mountains for some time. When the wheat ripened, we went outside the mountains to glean wheat. Later, the whole family went to visit my elderly uncle, who had no one to care for him. By this time, my eldest child, Jiming, was already twelve years old.

　　My uncle's surname was He, and he lived in Hejia Ao, not far from Xingushu Ao. The old man only had a few earthen cave dwellings and a few mu of barren ridge land. He had no son. The poor uncle couldn't help but feel sad when he saw our plight. He said to my wife and me in front of our grandson, Jiming, "Although I have some grain to eat, I'm old and can't work anymore, so I can't take care of you. You two are still young and have prospects. You can go out and try your luck. Let Jiming stay with me. When I die, he can bury me, and this broken family fortune will be Jiming's." My uncle's words moved and troubled us. We thought that it would be better for the child to stay with his uncle than to beg for food, so we made another hard decision and agreed to our uncle's request. From then on, Liu Jiming changed his surname to He and was called He Jiming.

　　Four years later, my wife gave birth to our third child. Still unable to support him, we gave him to a Zhang family in Hujiapo, Houling, Puhua Town, in the same county, who had a son but no daughter. He was renamed Zhang Shuanniu. Seven years later, in 1942, our fourth child was born.

　　As soon as the child was born, we worried about how to raise him. Worry we did, but this time we were determined not to give him away again. This was the only root of our Liu family! Even if we had to eat vegetables and swallow bran, beg for food, we would raise him ourselves. In the end, we managed to keep the child and named him Liu Shuji…

　　This is how my family was forced to break apart in the old society!

　　In the new society, our fragmented family was reunited and became one family. Speaking of this, we must thank our benefactor, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who brought us the happiness of family reunion!

　　After liberation in 1949, the world underwent a great change, and my family also underwent a great change. Before liberation, my second child, Ye Xingjin, who was given to the old woman in Daogouyu, Caojiashan, in the southern mountains, came to Heaoling with his adoptive father, Ye Zhenyou, after his adoptive mother died, and lived with us, uniting the two families into one. After liberation, He Jiming, the eldest son who had supported my uncle's family, also returned from being a long-term worker for more than ten years to escape being conscripted at the age of thirteen, and even got married. Then, Zhang Shuanniu, the third child, who was given to Hujiapo, Houling, Puhua Town, also returned to Heaoling with his adoptive father, Zhang Xiawa. From then on, the four families became one family.

　　Time flies so fast. This year is already the tenth year after liberation. Since the day of liberation, our lives have been like climbing a ladder, each step higher than the last. In 1954, we built ourselves five large houses and also started raising livestock. After cooperativization, the roots of poverty were completely eradicated.

　　Especially after the establishment of the People's Commune last year, both people and wealth have prospered even more. Now my family has a total of eleven people: the three of us old folks, four sons, two daughters-in-law, and two grandsons. People all say with envy, "Old Liu, you are truly prosperous in both people and wealth now!" This saying is very true. My family has been working hard for generations, but now all four of my sons have learned skills that are stronger than their predecessors. The eldest, He Jiming, is the team's breeder. The second, Ye Xingjin, a Communist Party member, is the production team leader. The third, Zhang Shuanniu, is a member of the Communist Youth League and is learning carpentry. The fourth, Liu Shuji, is studying in middle school. With a guaranteed life, the whole family has more income than we can spend each year, and we no longer worry about food and clothing. Isn't this "prosperity in both people and wealth"?

　　The happiness that the new society has brought to my family cannot be described in three days and three nights. In a word, only after liberation did I truly live a human life. Although I am sixty-six years old, the more I live, the younger I feel, and the more prospects I have! (Notes by Zhang Zixin)

专栏：我这十年来

    四姓亲兄弟
    陕西蓝田玉山公社社员　刘永顺
    同志，你要问我的家吗？这样的家世上可真少有，说起来我就要恨旧社会，感激新社会。
    现在我们住在陕西蓝田县玉山公社贺凹岭，老家是县东高原上的杏树凹。要谈我的家，就得从杏树凹谈起。
    原来我们的家还过得去，靠着我和老婆一双手，总算够吃够喝。但是旧社会的苛捐杂税和恶霸逼得过不成日子，到民国十七年，把我闹得要啥没啥，成了净净光！为了谋生，我就和老婆背着儿子继明下河北（渭河北），在那里租了地主十几亩地，谁知刚刚把庄稼安上，第二年就遭了大旱，土焦草不生，十有九家没啥吃，这就是人所共知的民国十八年年馑。河北的老百姓都扶老携幼爬过渭河滩，往南山里钻。我俩口一商量，咱是南山跟前人，究竟是本乡，到那里求亲戚朋友也有门路，就一块逃回蓝田来。可是，那时是“穷倒街头无人问”，没奈何，我和老婆只好进南山去讨饭。
    讨饭到了倒沟峪，正在死活不得的关头，老婆生了第二个娃。多增加了一张嘴，就多了一份艰难。有一天，要饭要到曹家山，天黑了，正碰上大风大雪，没处歇，一家大小就卧在一家饭店的房檐下，冻得团团颤。老婆有病，孩子没奶吃，饿得哇哇叫。不知怎么感动了店主人，半夜里把我们一家人叫到屋里去住。
    原来店主人有个打算。第二天他对我们说：“咱们穷人哪，多命苦，少吃没穿还肯生孩子。现在天寒地冻的，我看这孩子你们也养不活，这里曹家山叶振有俩口，日子过得不错，就是没后人，不如把怀里这个娃送给他们作儿子，也免得孩子受罪……”儿女是娘身上的肉，老婆一听这话哭个不停。但那时又有什么办法呢，于是一家人流着眼泪把刚刚出了“满月”的孩子送给了叶振有家。孩子到了叶家起名就叫叶兴金。
    二娃给了人后，在南山又混了一个时期，赶麦熟口上，我们就到山外拾麦。以后一家人去探望年迈无人照管的老舅父。这时我的大娃继明已经十二岁了。
    舅父姓贺，就住在离杏树凹不远的贺家凹。老汉只有孔老土窑，几亩薄岭地，没有儿。穷舅父看见我们这个光景，不免一场伤心。他当着外孙继明的面对我俩说：“我虽有把粮食吃，可人老做不动，也顾不了你们。你俩还年轻，有奔头，可以外边跑，去碰碰好时运。叫继明跟上我，我死了把我一埋，这份破家当就算继明的。”舅父的话说得我们又感动又为难。我们想，孩子跟上舅父总比要着吃强，于是又下了个狠心，答应了舅父的要求。从此，刘继明就改姓贺，叫贺继明。
    四年以后，老婆又生了第三个孩子，还是因为养活不过，把他送给了本县普化镇后岭虎家坡一个少儿没女的张家，改名张拴牛。又过了七年，1942年，我们的第四个孩子出世了。
    孩子一生下，我们就熬煎怎样养活他。熬煎是熬煎，这回可坚决不再给人了。这是我们刘家一条根哪！哪怕是吃菜咽糠，行乞讨饭，也要亲手把他养大。结果算是把孩子留下来了，起名叫刘树计。……
    我的家在旧社会就是这样被逼得四分五裂！
    到了新社会，我们这四分五裂的亲骨肉才得到团聚，合成了一家。说到这里，我们就要感谢恩人共产党和毛主席，正是共产党和毛主席给我们带来了合家团圆的幸福啊！
    1949年解放后，世道来了个大翻身，我的家也来了个大翻身。临解放前，很早就送给了南山倒沟峪曹家山的老二叶兴金，在养母死后，就和养父叶振有来到贺凹岭，和我们住在一起，两家合一家。解放后，给我舅家顶了门的老大从十三岁那年为逃壮丁出外给人扛了十多年长工的贺继明，也回来了，还娶了媳妇。接着，送给普化镇后岭虎家坡的老三张拴牛，也和养父张夏娃一同回到贺凹岭。从此，四家合成了一家。
    日子过得真快，今年已是解放后第十个年头了。自解放那天起，我们的生活就像上梯子一样，一阶比一阶高。到1954年，给自己盖了五间大房，还看起了牲口。合作化后，穷根子才彻底挖掉了。
    特别是去年成立了人民公社以后，更是人财两旺了。现在我家共十一口人：我们三个老人，四个儿，两个儿媳，两个孙子。人们都羡慕地说：“老刘，你现在真是人财两旺啊！”这话说得很对，我家人老几辈子都是下苦人，可现在四个儿子都学下了比他先人强的本事。老大贺继明，担任队的饲养员。老二叶兴金，共产党员，担任生产小队长。老三张拴牛，是共青团员，学习木匠手艺。老四刘树计正念中学。生活有了保障，全家每年收入用不完，再不愁吃穿，这还不是“人财两旺”吗？
    新社会给我家带来的幸福三天三夜也说不完，一句话，只有解放后我才真正过到人的生活。我虽是六十六岁的人了，越活越觉得年轻，越有奔头！（张自新笔记）
