On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the World Peace Council extends its congratulations and heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for all they have done for world peace.

    It is indeed very meaningful that the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace was established the day after the founding of the People's Republic on October 1, 1949. From that day until now, all the actions taken by the Chinese people to strive for peace have been a powerful force inspiring all those who want to rid the world of war.

    After the world-renowned Stockholm Appeal against atomic weapons was issued in 1950, people all over China signed their names one after another. Similarly, every initiative of the World Peace Council has received strong and inspiring support from the People's Republic of China. Now, the amazing achievements of the Great Leap Forward have increased the influence of the People's Republic within the world to an extent far beyond what could have been imagined a few years ago. This development, along with changes in other parts of the world, has created an international situation that can be used to make war impossible. If any ruler in the world were so foolish or evil as to launch a war, they would surely suffer a shameful defeat. If any politician or political figure does not believe this, let them take a good look at these celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the founding of China.

    As we observe the amazing achievements made by the Chinese people since the founding of the People's Republic, we realize that world peace is one of the necessary conditions for making such progress in human happiness. But there is another aspect of the situation that is becoming clearer day by day. This progress has been made possible because the people have freed themselves from foreign aggression, colonial oppression, and all other forms of the evils of exploitation. Therefore, it must be said that unless these three evils are eradicated from all parts of the world, as has been done in China, world peace will not be consolidated and lasting.

    Therefore, all those who sincerely hope for peace and human happiness are deeply grateful for the help and support that the newly liberated Chinese people have given to all the people in other parts of the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; these people also hope to get rid of aggression, colonialism, or semi-colonial oppression as a condition of peace. The Bandung Conference, in which the representatives of the People's Republic of China played a very prominent role, made a similar statement to the whole world and to those countries participating in the conference about the necessary conditions for peace.

    The World Peace Council has always strived to promote cultural exchange as a way to open the door to peaceful relations between the people of all countries. In this regard, Peking Opera, Chinese acrobatics, and other cultural activities that enjoy a reputation around the world receive high honor.

    On behalf of all peace-loving people in all countries, we salute you for your heroic struggles in the past and your amazing leap into the future, and wish you success in the years to come.

    Long live the Chinese people!

    Long live the friendship and solidarity of the people of the world!

    Long live world peace! (with picture)

    世界和平理事会主席团委员
    文幼章宣读的世界和平理事会贺词
    在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，世界和平理事会谨对中国人民为世界和平所做的一切致以祝贺和深切的感谢。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会在1949年10月1日人民共和国成立以后的第二天宣告成立，这的确是非常有意义的。从那天起一直到现在，中国人民为争取和平而采取的一切行动一直是一支鼓舞着所有想使世界免除战争的人们的强大力量。
    在1950年发表世界闻名的反对原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言以后，中国全国各地的人民都纷纷签名。同样，世界和平理事会的每一项倡议都得到中华人民共和国的有力的、鼓舞人心的支持。现在，大跃进的惊人成就已经使人民共和国在世界范围内的影响增加到远远超过几年以前所能想像的程度。这一发展同世界其他地区的变化一起，带来了一种可以用来使战争不可能发生的国际局势。如果世界上有任何统治者竟然会愚蠢或者邪恶到发动战争的地步，他们肯定将会遭到可耻的失败。如果有任何政治家或者政界人物不相信这一点，那就让他们好好地看看中国建国十周年的这些庆祝活动吧。
    当我们注视中国人民在人民共和国成立以来取得的惊人的成就时，我们认识到，世界和平是在人类幸福方面取得这种进展的必要条件之一。但是情况还有另一个变得一天比一天更清楚的方面。这种进展所以能够取得，是因为人民摆脱了外国侵略、殖民地压迫和所有其他形式的剥削的罪恶。因此，必须说，除非从世界上一切地方铲除这三种罪恶，就像在中国所做的那样，否则世界和平是不会巩固和持久的。
    因此所有真诚地希望得到和平和人类幸福的人深深地感激新解放的中国人民给予世界上其他地方，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的所有人们的帮助和支持；这些人也同样希望摆脱侵略、殖民主义或半殖民主义压迫作为和平的条件。中华人民共和国的代表在其中起了非常显著的作用的万隆会议向全世界，向那些参加这个会议的国家就和平的必要条件作了类似的说明。
    世界和平理事会一向努力促进文化交流，作为打开通向各国人民的和平关系的门户的一个方法。在这方面京剧、中国杂技和其他在世界范围内享受声誉的文化活动得到很高的荣誉。
    我们代表所有国家的一切爱好和平的人民，为了你们过去的英勇斗争和你们向未来的惊人飞跃而向你们致敬，并祝你们在未来的年代中获得成功。
    中国人民万岁！
    世界人民的友谊和团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
