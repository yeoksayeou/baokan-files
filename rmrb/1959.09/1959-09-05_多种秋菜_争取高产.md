Plant More Autumn Vegetables and Strive for High Yields
    The current temperature is still relatively high, which is a suitable season for the growth of autumn vegetables. Many regions, while busily harvesting early autumn crops, are seizing the opportunity to organize labor and rush to plant a large number of autumn vegetables. Some regions are continuing to make full use of all vacant land to vigorously increase the planting of vegetables, striving to make this year's autumn vegetable planting area even larger than last year's. For example, the area for planting autumn vegetables in Hebei Province this year has doubled compared to last year. Liaoning Province has not only increased the autumn vegetable planting area by 70% compared to last year, but also continues to make use of the edges of fields, corners of houses, and scattered land to rush plant pickled mustard greens, mustard greens, etc. Seize every day and every inch of land. We should have this spirit: plant until the climate no longer allows planting, plant until there is no more land to plant.
    Increasing the planting of autumn vegetables has particularly important significance this year. Many regions have suffered relatively serious water and drought disasters, and autumn crops have suffered losses to varying degrees. In order to make up for the losses caused by the disaster, it is necessary to replant some late autumn crops, and special attention should be paid to increasing the planting of autumn vegetables. Vegetables have high yields and a long growing season; they can be used as non-staple foods and can replace some grains. Throughout the years, Chinese farmers have had the experience of using vegetables to supplement grains and storing vegetables for famine preparedness. Therefore, seizing the opportunity, fully mobilizing the masses, using all favorable conditions, and massively rush planting some fast-maturing radishes, cabbages, etc., according to the local climate and in accordance with local conditions, is a great thing that benefits people's lives. This should be done in both disaster areas and non-disaster areas, urban suburbs and rural areas.
    Now, increasing the planting of autumn vegetables, according to the custom of "radishes in the first ten days of the hottest period, cabbages in the second ten days," the season seems to be very late; therefore, some people think that planting will be of no avail. According to the season, planting vegetables at this time is indeed a bit late, which will affect certain yields and quality. However, it should be seen that most vegetables are leaf-use plants, and as long as they are rushed planted and management is strengthened, there can be a certain harvest. Even for vegetables like radishes, if they cannot grow into large fleshy roots due to the short growing period, radish leaves and small fleshy roots can still be eaten. Planting one more piece of land now will result in harvesting one more piece of land of vegetables in the future; even if they grow poorly, it is still better than not planting and harvesting less.
    Where do the seeds needed for increasing the planting of autumn vegetables come from? On the one hand, mutual support between regions and communes should be promoted; on the other hand, each unit should also tap its potential and strive for self-sufficiency. We should focus on self-reliance and supplement it with external assistance. At present, some places have adopted methods such as planting in holes, transplanting seedlings, and reforming sowing tools to save vegetable seeds, solving the needs for increased planting. For example, the Andong area of Liaoning Province originally lacked more than 60,000 jin of seeds, and Xinmin County lacked 50,000 jin; after taking various measures to save seed use, the seeds were enough. All regions can rely on the masses to find ways to solve this problem according to their local conditions.
    For the autumn vegetables that have already been sown, field management should be strengthened immediately, striving to exceed the unit area yield of previous years. This year, many regions have suffered severe water and drought disasters, followed by pests and diseases; in some regions, due to the shortage of manpower and animal power during sowing, land preparation was not detailed enough, and base fertilizer was insufficient; moreover, because the area for planting autumn vegetables this year is relatively large, some areas and troops, institutions, and schools that have not grown vegetables before have planted vegetables, and technical skills are not proficient, which has also affected the quality of sowing. Therefore, this year, field management needs to be strengthened particularly for autumn vegetables.
    According to this year's situation, the current field management work for autumn vegetables needs to focus on: checking seedlings and replanting missing ones, topdressing fertilizer early, watering in a timely manner, cultivating in a timely manner, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. In waterlogged areas, drainage and irrigation systems should be actively organized, accumulated water should be drained, the backs of ridges should be widened and raised, or high-bed planting should be adopted, and quick-acting fertilizers should be applied early to promote vegetable development and growth. In dry areas, irrigation and moisture conservation work needs to be done well. For pests and diseases, a prediction and forecasting network and joint prevention zones should be established and improved, with designated personnel responsible for regular inspections, timely detection, and timely organization of forces for prevention, control, and eradication.
    In the process of strengthening vegetable field management, various regions can also organize technical instruction and technical exchange work according to the situation, so that new vegetable areas can improve the technology of vegetable cultivation with the help of old vegetable areas and state-owned farms and experimental research departments, do a good job in field management, and strive to plant more and harvest more autumn vegetables.
    In short, at present, all regions must not only do everything possible to plant more autumn vegetables and strive for more planting and more harvesting, but also make every effort to manage the autumn vegetables that have already been planted well, striving to increase the unit area yield. With this two-pronged approach, we may achieve a great autumn vegetable harvest this autumn. The situation is very good, and the time is pressing; we should redouble our efforts and not miss the opportunity.

### 多种秋菜  争取高产

    多种秋菜  争取高产
    目前气温仍然较高，正是适宜于秋菜生长的季节。许多地区已经在紧张地收割早秋作物的同时，抓紧时机，组织劳力，抢种了大量秋菜。有些地区正在继续利用一切空闲地大力增种蔬菜，争取今年秋菜的播种面积更多地超过去年。如河北省今年种秋菜的面积比去年扩大了一倍。辽宁省不仅比去年秋菜播种面积增加70％；而且还在继续利用田边地角、家前屋后零星土地，抢种雪里红、芥菜等等。抓紧一天是一天，多种一分是一分。应该有这样的精神：种到气候再也不容许种了为止，种到再也没有一点地可以种了为止。
    增种秋菜，在今年有特别重大的意义。许多地区遭受了比较严重的水旱灾害，秋季作物有不同程度的损失。为了弥补因灾造成的损失，必须重新补种一部分晚秋作物，特别要注意增种秋菜。蔬菜产量高，适宜生长的季节长；既可以作为副食品，又可以顶一部分粮食。历年来，我国农民就有以菜顶粮、储菜备荒的经验。因此，抓紧时机，充分发动群众，利用一切有利条件，按照当地气候，因地制宜地大量抢种一部分成熟快的萝卜、白菜等等，是有利于人民生活的大好事情。不论灾区或非灾区，城市郊区或农村，都应当这样做。
    现在增种秋菜，按照“头伏萝卜二伏菜”的习惯，似乎节令已很晚了；因此有些人认为种了也是无济于事。按照节令来说，目前种菜的确是稍晚了一些，会影响一定的产量和质量。但是，应当看到，蔬菜多是叶用植物，只要抢种上并加强管理，就可以有一定的收成。即使像萝卜这样的蔬菜，如果因为生长期短不能长成很大的肉质根，萝卜叶子和小的肉质根仍然可供食用。现在多种一分地，将来就可以多收一分地的菜；即使长的差一些，也总比不种少收好。
    增种秋菜需要的种子从哪里来？一方面应当提倡地区之间、公社之间互相支援；另一方面各单位也要挖掘潜力、力争自给。应以自力更生为主，争取外援为辅。目前，有些地方已经采用了垵播、移苗、改革播种工具等办法节约菜种，解决了增种的需要。如辽宁省的安东地区原来缺种六万多斤，新民县缺五万斤；采取各种节约用种的办法后，种子都够用了。各地都可以根据本地具体情况，依靠群众设法解决这个问题。
    对于已经播种下去的秋菜，要立即加强田间管理，力争单位面积产量超过往年。今年不少地区水旱灾害严重，随着水旱灾害而来的又有病虫灾害；有些地区由于播种时人力、畜力紧张，整地不够细致，基肥也不足；而且由于今年秋菜播种面积较大，有些没有种过蔬菜的地区和部队、机关、学校都种了菜，技术不熟练，也影响了播种质量。因此，今年对秋菜特别需要加强田间管理。
    根据今年的情况，目前秋菜的田间管理工作，需要抓住：查苗补苗，提早追肥，适时浇水，及时中耕，防治病虫害等等。在水涝地区，应积极整理排灌系统，排出积水，加宽加高垅背或采用高畦栽植，提早追施速效性肥料，促进蔬菜发育生长。在干旱的地区，需要做好灌溉、保墒工作。对于病虫灾害，要建立和健全预测、预报网和联防区，指定专人负责，经常检查，及时发现，及时组织力量防治和扑灭。
    在加强蔬菜田间管理的过程中，各地还可以根据情况组织技术传授和技术交流的工作，使新菜区能够在老菜区和国营农场、试验研究部门的帮助之下，提高栽培蔬菜的技术，做好田间管理工作，争取秋菜种得多收得多。
    总之，目前各地既要尽一切可能多种秋菜，争取多种多收；又要尽一切努力把已种下去的秋菜管理好，争取提高单位面积产量。这样双管齐下，我们今年秋季就有可能取得秋菜大丰收。形势很好，时机紧迫；应该加倍努力，不要坐失良机。
