Xinhua News Agency, September 14th.  Zeng Shiying, a map expert with forty years of experience in map compilation, told our reporter today that the so-called McMahon Line of the Indian government is illegal, and the Chinese people will never recognize this line.

This expert, who compiled the "Shen Bao Atlas" with Ding Wenjiang and Weng Wenhao, took out many maps of India, Britain, and China, placed them in front of the reporter, and pointed to the Sino-Indian boundary on the map, saying: On the 1:1,000,000 scale map "India and its Adjacent Countries" drawn by the Survey of India from 1919 to 1932, the Sino-Indian boundary line extending due east from the southeastern corner of Bhutan, although represented by the symbol of a tribal boundary line, its position and shape are consistent with the Sino-Indian boundary line on our current maps. There is no so-called "McMahon Line" on this map.  On another 1:2,500,000 scale "Tibet and its Adjacent Countries" map published in India, 1938 edition, there is also no so-called "McMahon Line."  The boundary line drawn on that map, extending due east from the southeastern corner of Bhutan, is the same as the boundary line drawn on maps published in our country. This boundary line extending due east terminates at 93 and a half degrees east longitude, but this precisely shows that even on maps drawn by India itself, there is still a section of the boundary line here, and the "McMahon Line" does not exist, so they dare not openly draw it.

Zeng Shiying said: "In addition, the 'Oxford Advanced Atlas,' published by the British, has always been considered an authoritative work in capitalist society. In all the versions I have seen, up to the fifth edition of 1936, the way this section of the Sino-Indian border was drawn was the same as the way it was drawn on maps published in our country.  I have not seen the sixth edition, but in the seventh edition of 1942, the boundary line was moved to the position mentioned by Indian Prime Minister Nehru. We can think about why this continuously published atlas did not change this section of the boundary line earlier or later, but secretly changed it during the difficult days of our War of Resistance Against Japan. Its despicable methods can be imagined."

Zeng Shiying said: "The Sino-Indian boundary line on our current maps is not only the same as the way the boundary line was drawn on the 'Shen Bao Atlas' published before liberation, but also consistent with the boundary line (including the eastern and western sections) on the 'Complete Map of Tibet' translated from French by Hu Weide in St. Petersburg in the 30th year of Guangxu [1904]. Therefore, we can remind Prime Minister Nehru that we do not need to take out the 'maps that are favorable to them' as you said to prove that the 'McMahon Line' has no basis in any treaty or tradition. On the contrary, you can conveniently take out the maps you have drawn and published yourselves to see how those maps are drawn."

Zeng Shiying, a representative of the National People's Congress, finally told reporters that he has been engaged in cartography for forty years and personally realizes that the Sino-Indian border issue can only be fully resolved through friendly consultation based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.  The Chinese people, who have stood up, love peace, but will never be bullied or intimidated. To try to solve historical problems with unilateral actions is a delusion and also foolish.

### 地图专家曾世英列举中外地图证明  麦克马洪线是非法的

    地图专家曾世英列举中外地图证明
    麦克马洪线是非法的
    新华社14日讯  从事编制地图工作已有四十年经验的专家曾世英今天对本社记者发表谈话，指出印度政府所谓的麦克马洪线是非法的，中国人民决不承认这条界线。
    这位曾和丁文江、翁文灏一起编纂申报馆地图的专家拿出了印度、英国和中国的许多地图，放在记者面前，指着图上的中印边界向记者指出：由1919至1932年印度测量局绘制的“印度及其邻国”的一百万分之一比例尺地图上，由不丹东南角向正东延伸的中印界线，虽然以部落界线的符号表示的，但其位置和形势是和我国现行地图上的中印界线相符的。这份地图上并没有所谓“麦克马洪线”。在另外一张印度出版的二百五十万分之一“西藏及其邻国”图的1938年版本上也没有所谓“麦克马洪线”，那张图上画的由不丹东南角向正东延伸的界线，和我国出版的地图上画的界线是相同的。这条向正东延伸的界线到东经九十三又二分之一度终止了，但这正说明就是在印度自己绘制的地图上这里毕竟还有一段界线，而“麦克马洪线”是不存在的，因此不敢公然画上。
    曾世英说：“此外英国出版的‘牛津高级地图集’（OXFORD ADVANCED AT—LAS），在资本主义社会里一向被认为具有一定权威性的著作，我所看到它的各个版本中，直到1936年的第五版，对于这段中印边界的画法是和我国出版的地画上的画法相同的，第六版没有看到；但到1942年的第七版上却把界线移画到印度总理尼赫鲁所说的位置上，我们可以想一想这本连续出版的地图集上，对于这一段界线为什么早不改晚不改，而要在我国抗日战争的艰苦日子里偷偷摸摸地改了过去，其卑劣手法也就可以想见。”
    曾世英说：“我们现行地图上的中印边界线不仅和解放以前出版的‘申报地图’上边界线的画法相同，即和光绪三十年胡维德在俄京译自法人窦脱勒依的‘西藏全图’上的边界线（包括东西两段）也是相符的。所以我们可以提醒尼赫鲁总理先生，我们用不着拿出像你所说的‘对他们有利的地图’来证明‘麦克马洪线’是没有任何条约和传统上的根据的，相反的你可以很方便地拿出你们自己绘制出版的地图来看一看，那些地图上是怎样画的。”
    这位全国人民代表大会代表曾世英最后对记者说，他从事制图工作四十年，切身认识到中印国界问题只有根据五项原则通过友好协商，才能全面解决。站起来的中国人民爱好和平，但是决不会受欺侮也不怕威胁的，要想以片面行动来解决历史上遗留下来的问题，那是妄想，也是愚蠢的。
