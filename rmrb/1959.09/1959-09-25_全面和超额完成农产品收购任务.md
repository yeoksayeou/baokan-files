Editorial:
    The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been warmly responded to by the members of the people's communes across the country. A surge in production, centered on combating right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and fully strengthening the late-stage field management of autumn crops, is rapidly unfolding. The current situation, as stated in the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural products in 1959, is that "most areas of the country can expect a bumper harvest of autumn crops such as grain, oilseeds, cotton, tobacco, and hemp." At the same time, the industrial front is continuing to leap forward on an even larger scale, requiring the agricultural sector to provide a greater variety and quantity of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties as raw materials for production. Based on the development of industrial and agricultural production, social purchasing power will further increase, and foreign trade will further develop. In the face of such a favorable situation, doing a good job in the procurement and distribution of agricultural products and greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and the entire national economy has become a major and glorious political task for the entire Party and the entire people. Now that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have issued instructions on doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural products in 1959, all localities must earnestly implement these instructions, seize the opportunity, launch a mass movement to enthusiastically sell agricultural products, and strive to complete and overfulfill the task of agricultural product procurement.
    Conscientiously doing a good job in the procurement and distribution of agricultural and sideline products is of great political and economic significance for the development of urban and rural production and the worker-peasant alliance. We know that among the main consumer goods, agricultural and sideline products and industrial products made from agricultural and sideline products account for about 70%; agricultural and sideline products and their processed products also account for a considerable proportion of the total value of export commodities; at the same time, people's communes can only sell more and better commodities to the state in order to exchange for the necessary means of production, to enable the communes to obtain more cash income, increase the wages of commune members, and exchange for the necessary means of livelihood.
    In order to complete and overfulfill the 1959 task of procuring agricultural and sideline products, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, conscientiously implement various agricultural product procurement policies, and achieve "five fasts," "five simultaneities," and "five goods" in our work. That is to say, we must seize the harvest season and resolutely achieve fast harvesting, fast threshing and drying, fast procurement, fast processing, and fast transportation; we must achieve harvesting, threshing and drying, procurement, processing, and transportation simultaneously; we must achieve good harvests, good procurement, good distribution, good storage, and good seed preservation. The "five fasts" and "five simultaneities" require all localities to closely link and integrate the various links of agricultural product harvesting, threshing and drying, procurement, processing, and transportation. We must not only harvest agricultural products well in a timely manner, but also procure the agricultural and sideline products that should be procured in a timely manner, and quickly process and transport them. Experience tells us that during the harvest season, rural work is very busy. If these links are not closely integrated, there will be a phenomenon of mutual involvement, which will affect the smooth progress of the entire rural work. Therefore, the "five fasts" and "five simultaneities" are the objective requirements of the entire rural work, and we must fully prepare, deeply mobilize, act quickly, and complete them in one go. However, having only the "five fasts" and "five simultaneities" is not enough; we must also have the "five goods." "Five fasts," "five simultaneities," and "five goods" meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, and are a summary of the experience of agricultural and sideline product procurement work over the years. We must fully, correctly, utilize, and develop this experience.
    In order to best complete the task of agricultural product procurement, we must adhere to the working method of the mass line and implement various agricultural product procurement policies. In this regard, all localities have accumulated a set of fairly mature experiences. For example, in grain procurement, for many years, we have mobilized the masses and relied on the masses to implement the method of dividing areas, designating points, setting times, setting quality, and setting quantities for delivery, achieving the requirements of drying, winnowing, and full grains, and have achieved great results. In cotton procurement, in recent years, due to the implementation of the mass line working method of "four separations" (separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, separate sales) and "four evaluations" (evaluating grade, evaluating length, evaluating ginning outturn, evaluating moisture content and impurities), the phenomenon of too high or too low prices in grading and pricing has been greatly reduced, the quality of cotton has been generally improved, the mass viewpoint and production viewpoint of procurement personnel have been further strengthened, and the relationship between the state and farmers has become closer. We have truly achieved fairness and reasonableness, and everyone is satisfied.
    The key to achieving the "five fasts," "five simultaneities," and "five goods" lies in strengthening leadership by Party committees and governments at all levels, combating right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, taking agricultural production as the center, and making overall plans and comprehensive arrangements for various rural tasks, grasping the procurement of agricultural and sideline products tightly, meticulously, practically, and well. Experience has proven that if a certain agricultural or sideline product or local specialty is not arranged or not arranged well, then no one will procure or procure it well; conversely, if a certain agricultural or sideline product or local specialty is effectively arranged, and through everyone's efforts, the procurement task can be guaranteed to be completed and overfulfilled. In terms of the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, we must take grain, cotton, and oilseeds as the center, and make overall plans and comprehensive arrangements for the procurement of various agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, so as to, in accordance with the policies of the Party and the state, procure all useful agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, whether they are large or small, concentrated or scattered, domestic or wild. In order to strengthen leadership over the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, all localities must also divide the special front of agricultural product procurement, establish strong working bodies, led by the responsible Party secretary, to ensure the sound development of the agricultural and sideline product procurement movement.
    Unifying the allocation of rural labor is an important condition for completing the tasks of agricultural and sideline product procurement, processing, and transportation in a timely manner. The characteristics of this year are that agricultural and sideline products are on the market earlier, in large quantities, and concentrated in time, which requires Party committees at all levels to organize and allocate the necessary labor in a timely manner, and quickly invest in the procurement, processing, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, especially to launch a large-scale short-distance transportation movement to complete the task of collecting and transporting a huge quantity of agricultural products. However, at the same time, the "three autumns" work and farmland water conservancy construction, and the accumulation and production of manure movement are also being fully launched, all of which require a large amount of labor. In this situation, all localities must fully mobilize and organize all labor and semi-labor, implement unified scheduling and reasonable allocation, and do everything possible to improve labor productivity. It should be seen that the people's communes are more consolidated, their superiority is more pronounced, the experience of the vast number of cadres in arranging, organizing, and using labor is richer, and the vast number of people are greatly encouraged by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and their labor enthusiasm is extremely high. These are all extremely favorable conditions, and as long as we can reasonably arrange rural labor, we will be able to ensure the necessary needs in all aspects.
    In addition to doing a good job in the harvesting and procurement of agricultural products, all localities must pay attention to the following issues. First, we must mobilize the masses to harvest carefully and meticulously, pick up dry and clean, and return every grain to the family. This year's tobacco demand is very large, and we should collect good tobacco, broken tobacco, tobacco seedlings, tobacco branches, tobacco stalks, tobacco stalk skin, and soil-covered leaves; hemp should be carefully harvested and peeled, leaving no trace. Second, we must combine state procurement with the distribution of people's communes and production teams well. All localities should rationally determine the proportion of agricultural and sideline products for delivery and retention, and people's communes and production teams should strive to increase the commodity rate of agricultural and sideline products. Third, we must effectively strengthen the warehousing and storage of agricultural and sideline products, and fully utilize all kinds of warehouses, sheds, mats, cushions, and private empty houses; establish a personal responsibility system for storage work, be diligent in inspection and turning, and be serious about fire prevention, special prevention, theft prevention, water prevention, mold prevention, insect prevention, and moisture prevention. Fourth, we should educate cadres and farmers to use agricultural and sideline products that are retained sparingly, especially to mobilize cadres and farmers to plan grain use, be frugal, and live a good life; mobilize communes and teams to carry out grain reserves on the condition of completing the state procurement task, and reserve a backup for making up for deficiencies in lean years.
    While vigorously engaging in procurement work, all localities must plan to organize the supply of materials, achieving procurement and supply simultaneously, so that people's communes and production teams can purchase the necessary means of production in a timely manner, and the vast number of farmers can purchase the necessary means of livelihood in a timely manner. To this end, commercial departments must do a good job in the allocation of goods, and send the goods needed by rural areas to the countryside in a timely manner; and adopt a variety of flexible methods to send goods to the door, to the fields, and to the canteens, to serve production and facilitate farmers. Local people's banks should further improve the allocation and distribution of funds, effectively ensure the funding needs for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and support production by supporting agricultural product procurement. At the same time, we must rationally carry out the recovery of matured agricultural loans and agricultural product advance purchase deposits, help people's communes and production teams clear various cash accounts, and actively develop rural savings, absorb deposits, and increase construction funds.
    Currently, early autumn crops have already been marketed, and a large number of mid- and late-autumn crops are about to appear. The busy season of agricultural and sideline product harvesting and procurement is approaching. We must seize the opportunity, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, adhere to putting politics in command and the mass line, and conduct widespread and in-depth publicity and education on the general line of socialist construction and the state's agricultural product procurement policy to the vast number of farmers. We must launch a vigorous agricultural and sideline product procurement movement nationwide, and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the 1959 task of procuring agricultural and sideline products.

    全面和超额完成农产品收购任务
    党的八届八中全会的伟大号召得到全国人民公社的社员们的热烈响应。以反右倾，鼓干劲，全力加强秋季作物的后期田间管理为中心的超产运动正在迅速展开。目前的形势正像中共中央、国务院关于做好一九五九年度农产品收购工作的指示中所说的：“全国大部分地区的粮食、油料、棉花、烟叶、麻类等秋季作物可以得到丰收”。与此同时，工业战线正以更大的规模继续跃进，它要求农业方面提供品种更多、数量更大的农副产品和土特产品作为生产原料。在工农业生产发展的基础上，社会购买力将会进一步增长，对外贸易将会进一步发展。面对这样的大好形势，全力搞好农产品的收购和分配工作，大大促进工农业生产和整个国民经济的发展，就成为全党全民的一项重大的光荣的政治任务。现在，中共中央和国务院已经发出关于做好一九五九年度农产品收购工作的指示，各地必须认真贯彻执行这一指示，抓紧时机，发起一个踊跃交售农产品的群众运动，为完成和超额完成农产品收购任务而努力。
    认真做好农副产品的收购和分配工作，对于发展城乡生产和工农联盟，有着重大的政治意义和经济意义。我们知道，在主要消费品中，农副产品和以农副产品为原料的工业品约占70％；在出口商品总值中，农副产品及其加工品也占相当大的比重；同时，人民公社只有把更多的更好的商品卖给国家，才能换回必要的生产资料，才能使公社取得更多的现金收入，增加社员工资，换回必需的生活资料。
    为了完成和超额完成1959年度的农副产品收购任务，必须充分发动群众，认真贯彻执行各项农产品收购的政策，并在工作上做到“五快”、“五边”、“五好”。这就是说，必须抓紧收获季节，坚决做到快收割、快打晒、快收购、快加工、快调运；做到边收割、边打晒、边收购、边加工、边调运；做到收获好、收购好、分配好、保管好、留种好。“五快”、“五边”就是要求各地把农产品的收割、打晒、收购、加工、调运等各个环节很好地联系起来，密切结合，环环扣紧，既要及时把农产品很好地收获起来，又要把应该收购的农副产品及时收购到手，并且迅速加工和调运。经验告诉我们，在收获季节，农村工作十分繁忙，如果这几个环节不是密切结合进行，就要发生相互牵扯的现象，以致影响整个农村工作的顺利进行。所以“五快”、“五边”是整个农村工作的客观要求，必须充分准备，深入动员，迅速行动，一气呵成。但是，单有“五快”、“五边”还不够，还必须有“五好”。“五快”“五边”“五好”符合多快好省的要求，是多少年来农副产品收购工作的经验总结，我们必须充分地正确地运用和发展这个经验。
    为了最好地完成农产品收购任务，必须坚持群众路线的工作方法，贯彻执行各项农产品的收购政策。在这方面，各地已经积累了一套相当成熟的经验。比如在粮食收购方面，多少年来都是发动群众、依靠群众，实行了划片、定点、定时、定质、定量的交售方法，达到了晒干、扬净、籽粒饱满的要求，取得了很大成绩。在棉花收购方面，几年来由于实行了“四分”（分摘、分晒、分存、分售）、“四评”（评品级、评长度、评衣分率、评水分杂质）的群众路线工作方法，评级论价中的偏高偏低的现象大大减少，棉花质量普遍提高，采购人员的群众观点和生产观点进一步加强了，国家和农民的关系更加密切了。真正做到了公平合理，大家满意。
    实现“五快”“五边”“五好”的关键在于各级党委和政府加强领导，反右倾，鼓干劲，以农业生产为中心，对农村各项工作进行统筹兼顾、全面安排，把农副产品收购工作抓紧、抓细、抓实、抓好。经验证明：那一种农副产品、土特产品没有安排或者安排得不好，那一种农副产品、土特产品就没有人去收购或者收购得不好；相反，那一种农副产品、土特产品得到了切实安排，经过大家努力，收购任务就能保证完成和超额完成。而在农副产品的收购方面来说，必须以粮食、棉花、油料为中心，做到各种农副产品、土特产品的收购统筹兼顾、全面安排，以便根据党和国家的政策，把一切有用的农副产品、土特产品，不论是大宗的或小宗的，集中的或分散的，家生的或野生的，通通都收购起来。为了加强对农副产品收购工作的领导，各地还必须划分农产品收购的专门战线，建立有力的办事机构，由主管的党委书记挂帅，保证农副产品收购运动的健全发展。
    统一调配农村劳动力，是及时完成农副产品收购、加工和调运任务的重要条件。今年的特点是农副产品上市提早，数量很大，时间集中，这就要求各级党委及时组织和调配必要的劳动力，迅速投入农副产品的收购、加工和调运工作，特别是要开展一个大规模的短途运输运动，来完成极大数量的农产品集运任务。但是与此同时，“三秋”工作和农田水利建设、积肥造肥运动也正在全面展开，这些都需要大量的劳动力。在这种情况下，各地必须把一切劳动力和半劳动力都充分动员和组织起来，实行统一调度和合理分配，千方百计地提高劳动生产效率。应该看到，人民公社更加巩固了，优越性更加发挥了，广大干部安排、组织和使用劳动力的经验更加丰富了，加上广大人民受到党的八届八中全会的极大鼓舞，劳动积极性异常高涨。这些都是极为有利的条件，只要我们能够合理安排农村劳动力，就一定能够保证各方面必不可少的需要。
    除了做好农产品的收获和收购工作以外，各地还必须注意以下几个问题。第一，必须发动群众，精收细打，拾干拣净，颗粒还家。今年的烟叶需要量很大，应该把好烟、碎烟、烟苗、烟杈、烟秸、烟秆皮、土脚叶等都收起来；麻类应该做到精收细剥，一丝不留。第二，必须把国家收购和人民公社、生产队的分配很好地结合起来。各地要合理确定农副产品交售和留用的比例，人民公社和生产队应该力求提高农副产品的商品率。第三，必须切实加强农副产品的仓储保管工作，把各种仓、棚、席、垫和民间空房都充分利用起来；建立保管工作的专人负责制，勤于检查和翻晾，认真防火、防特、防盗、防水、防霉、防虫、防潮。第四，应该教育干部和农民，对于留用的农副产品，应该节俭使用，特别是要动员干部和农民计划用粮，省吃俭用，把日子过好；动员社、队在完成国家收购任务的条件下，搞点粮食储备，留有后备，以丰补歉。
    在大搞收购工作的同时，各地必须有计划地组织物资供应，做到边收购、边供应，使人民公社和生产队能够及时买到必要的生产资料，使广大农民能够及时买到必需的生活资料。为此，商业部门必须搞好商品的调拨，把农村需要的商品及时送下乡去；并且要采取多种多样的灵活的方式，把商品送上门、送到田、送到食堂，以服务于生产，便利农民。各地人民银行应该进一步做好资金调度和分配工作，切实保证农副产品收购的资金需要，通过支持农产品收购来支持生产。同时，要合理进行到期农贷和农产品预购定金的收回工作，帮助人民公社和生产队清理各种现金账务，并且积极开展农村储蓄，吸收存款，增加建设资金。
    目前早秋作物已经上市，大量的中、晚秋作物即将登场，农副产品收获和收购的繁忙季节即将到来，必须抓紧时机，在各级党委的统一领导下，坚持政治挂帅和群众路线，向广大农民广泛深入地进行社会主义建设总路线和国家对农产品的收购政策的宣传教育，在全国范围内开展一个轰轰烈烈的农副产品收购运动，为全面完成和超额完成1959年度农副产品收购任务而奋斗。
