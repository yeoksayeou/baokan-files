Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 31st: On the twentieth anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, the World Federation of Trade Unions wrote to the World Peace Council.

The WFTU expressed its firm belief that all workers and trade union organizations will support the initiatives of peace forces in all countries and continue to fight heroically to safeguard peace.

In its letter, the WFTU said that as the first victims of Nazi barbarism and as participants in the struggle against Hitlerite Nazis and Japanese militarists from the first day of World War II, workers and trade union organizations fully understood the cost and meaning of World War II.

Therefore, they were shocked by the arming of the militarists who brought death to Europe twenty years ago. They firmly demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and that the talks between Eisenhower and Khrushchev would lead to the settlement of all outstanding international issues through negotiations, to the elimination of the atomic threat, to disarmament, and to lasting peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 31st: On August 31, the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a statement on the twentieth anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, calling on all German people to stop German militarism and defend peace.

The statement said that after the surrender of Hitler's Germany, the German people had a great obligation to forever deprive the aggressive militarists and imperialists of the possibility of creating new misfortunes. But in West Germany, the warmongers are trying to postpone their inevitable death by launching a new world war. They are taking advantage of the fact that a peace treaty has not yet been concluded after World War II to prepare for war. The statement said that the German people can and must shatter these plans. The conclusion of a peace treaty will finally end World War II and prevent a new war.

The statement concluded by emphasizing that all the great socialist countries, headed by the powerful Soviet Union, will defend the cause of peace. The Soviet Union defeated Hitler, and today, the Soviet Union is even stronger, and standing with it are eleven socialist countries, including the German Democratic Republic - the first workers' and peasants' state of Germany, the first peaceful country of Germany. The existence of the German Democratic Republic and its increasing strength are the biggest obstacles to the plans of the West German war instigators.

    世界工联就二次世界大战爆发二十周年发出信件
    主张缔结对德和约和消除原子战争威胁
    民主德国全国阵线呼吁德国人民制止军国主义
    据新华社布拉格31日电　世界工会联合会在二次世界大战爆发二十周年之际写信给世界和平理事会。
  世界工联表示深信，全体工人和工会组织必将拥护各国和平力量的倡议，为维护和平而继续英勇斗争。
    世界工联在信中说，作为纳粹野蛮行为的首先受害者，并且作为从第二次世界大战的第一天起就对希特勒纳粹分子和日本军国主义分子进行斗争的参加者，工人和工会组织完全了解到第二次世界大战的代价和它的含义。
    因此，他们对于把二十年前给欧洲带来死亡的军国主义分子武装起来一事感到震惊，他们坚决要求缔结对德和约，要求艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫之间举行的会谈会导致一切悬而未决的国际问题通过谈判而获得解决，导致消除原子威胁，导致裁军和持久和平。
    据新华社柏林31日电　民主德国全国阵线全国委员会8月31日就二次世界大战爆发二十周年发表声明，呼吁全体德国人民制止德国军国主义，保卫和平。
    声明说，希特勒德国投降以后，德国人民承担着巨大的义务，要永远剥夺侵略性的军国主义分子和帝国主义分子制造新的不幸的可能性。但在西德，战争贩子们企图通过发动一次新的世界大战来推迟他们不可避免的死亡。他们正在利用第二次世界大战后尚未缔结和约的事实进行备战。声明说，德国人民能够、也必须粉碎这些计划。缔结和约将最终结束第二次世界大战和防止一次新的战争。
    声明最后着重指出，以强大的苏联为首的所有伟大的社会主义国家，将保卫住和平的事业。苏联曾经打败了希特勒，而今天，苏联更加强大了，和它站在一起的还有十一个社会主义国家，其中有德意志民主共和国——德国的第一个工农国家，德国的第一个和平国家。德意志民主共和国的存在和它的日益强大，是西德战争挑拨者的计划的最大障碍。
