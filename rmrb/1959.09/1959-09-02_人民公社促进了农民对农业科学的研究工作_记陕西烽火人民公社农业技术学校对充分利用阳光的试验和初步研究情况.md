People's communes promote farmers' research on agricultural science.
    -- A record of the experiment and preliminary research on fully utilizing sunlight by the Agricultural Technology School of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Shaanxi.	Hu Jiwei
    What is the situation of agricultural scientific research in rural areas after the people's communes were established? We went to the Qianxian Fenghuo People's Commune, led by farmer scientist Comrade Wang Baojing, to learn about it. The agricultural scientific research work here has seen significant development since the establishment of the commune.
    Sunlight - A Problem Worthy of Special Study
    Fully utilizing sunlight is a very important condition for increasing crop production. The "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture includes the issue of how to utilize sunlight in the aspect of rational close planting. However, the effect of sunlight on crops is probably a specialized problem worthy of research. Their experiments in this area this year have yielded valuable achievements. Why do some small experimental plots not grow well when they are over-densely planted? Is it because the soil is tilled shallowly? No, they are all deeply ploughed to about two chi (approximately 2/3 of a meter); is it because there is not enough fertilizer? No, they all use more than tens of thousands of jin per mu (a Chinese unit of area, approximately 667 square meters). The main reason is that it is too dense and there is a lack of sunlight. The wheat close-planting comparison experimental plots of the Fenghuo Commune clearly show that 300,000 to 400,000 ears per mu is the best; any denser, and the denser it is, the worse it gets. But if you look at all the densely planted experimental plots, the wheat in the middle does not grow well, but the wheat on the edges grows very well. According to the situation in several experimental plots of the Fenghuo Commune, the yield of the edge rows is 40% to 60% higher than that of the middle rows. Why do the edge rows grow so well? Because they have relatively sufficient sunlight. In the experimental fields of the Fenghuo Commune, there are also various designs for cultivated land terrain, including sun-facing slopes, round slopes, convex forms, etc. They have relatively detailed scientific records of light intensity. All the wheat that grows relatively well is in places where they get sufficient sunlight. Based on this principle, this year, all cotton and all corn in the Fenghuo Commune have adopted the "Wen Wu Hang" planting method, which is to change the original uniform row spacing to two rows very close together and two rows far apart, to increase sunlight exposure (for example, for corn, the row spacing for two close rows is one chi five cun (approximately 0.5 meters), and the distance between the pairs of rows is four chi (approximately 1.3 meters).
          Wide-Row Intercropping and Relay Planting System
    The experiment of utilizing sunlight in the Fenghuo Commune has achieved new results, which they call the "Wide-Row Intercropping and Relay Planting System." This experiment has been carried out for four years, expanding from an experiment on two fen (approximately 0.2 hectares) of land in 1955 to 60 mu (approximately 4 hectares) this year. Now this large-area high-yield field has yielded a great harvest, with a yield of 514 jin per mu (approximately 3.8 metric tons per hectare), which, in terms of harvest volume alone, is 123% higher than ordinary wheat fields. In this 60-mu large-area experimental field, it is divided into small plots that are five chi (approximately 1.6 meters) wide and three chi (approximately 1 meter) wide. Wheat is sown in the three-chi rows, and cotton is sown in the five-chi rows. The two crops are planted alternately and each has its own peak growing period. During the peak growing period of wheat, cotton is still very short, and the five-chi wide row it occupies is actually equivalent to empty land. Therefore, the wheat in the three-chi row can get relatively sufficient sunlight. The wheat grows with low stems, thick stalks, large ears, no lodging, mild rust disease, and high yields. Let’s take a look at the records of the growth of this intercropping experimental field and the growth of the large fields: Using the same Bima No. 1 variety and the same cultivation techniques, different results were obtained in the intercropping and relay planting experimental field and the ordinary cultivation large field with seven zhang (approximately 23 meters) wide rows.

    The cotton planted in the five-chi sowing width of this large experimental field was initially shaded by the wheat on both sides, and the seedlings were weaker, but there were very few cotton aphids, because when cotton aphids were spreading and harming the large fields, many aphids fell on the tall wheat on both sides. Now that the wheat has been harvested, the three-chi wide wheat fields that have been harvested have turned into large corridors for the cotton seedlings to ventilate and receive light. As of the end of July, the cotton seedlings in this field are growing very well. The number of plants with insect pests in general cotton fields reaches 60%-70%, but only 12% of the cotton seedlings in this field have insect pests; in addition, because the sunlight is more abundant than in other cotton fields, there is basically no excessive growth, which is also better than in other cotton fields. The results of last year's intercropping field experiment showed that not only did wheat yields increase by more than double compared to large fields, but last year's cotton, despite being hit by floods, still yielded more than 20% higher than large fields. A small one-mu experimental field for wide-row intercropping and relay planting of corn and wheat that began experimenting in the second half of last year also achieved remarkable results, yielding 1,737.1 jin of corn last autumn. Small soybeans were planted in the wide corn rows as green manure. After being turned over and pressed down last winter, wheat was planted, and this year's wheat yielded 1,167.4 jin.
    Regarding this wide-row intercropping and relay planting system, what width is best for the sowing width of wheat and cotton, and the comparative experiment of various sowing widths of cotton can only be seen after autumn. The comparative experiment of various sowing widths of wheat this year proves that the effect of the three-chi width is the best.
    At the commune's wheat production experience summary meeting from June 16 to 18, everyone was very interested in this new cultivation system. The meeting established a five-year rotation system for wide-row intercropping and relay planting. Both are divided into three-chi wide sowing widths. In the first and second years, green manure and wheat are planted in row A, and cotton is planted in row B; in the third and fourth years, rows A and B are interchanged, with cotton planted in row A and green manure and wheat planted in row B; in the fifth year, ordinary large-field cultivation is still used to plant all wheat, and corn is planted after the wheat harvest. The preliminary draft plan formulated by the Fenghuo Commune is as follows:Differentiation  Year First Year	Second Year   Third Year     Fourth Year    Fifth YearArea One Row A   Wheat + Green Manure Wheat + Green Manure Cotton       Cotton
     Row B   Cotton       Cotton       Wheat + Green Manure Wheat + Green Manure Wheat

                                                        + Green Manure
    Assuming this cultivation system is implemented, taking the Fenghuo Production Team of the Fenghuo Commune as an example, dividing the 2,000 mu of land into five rotation areas, 1,200 mu of wheat, 800 mu of cotton, 400 mu of replanted corn, and 800 mu of green manure (of which 200 mu can be harvested for soybeans) can be planted each year. In this way, by fully utilizing sunlight, using fertilizers in rotation, and planting green manure in rotation, the soil fertility will improve more and more. At the current level of cultivation technology, it is reliably estimated that 520,000 jin of wheat, 240,000 jin of corn, and 1,200 dan of cotton can be harvested each year.
    Now the Fenghuo Production Team has planned the land and is conducting a large-scale production experiment on 100 mu first.
              Supplementing Fertilizer with Light
    In this experiment, Comrade Wang Baojing also has a new purpose that is very worthy of attention regarding the use of fertilizer and soil improvement. He plans to use the surface soil layer of the wheat plots after the wheat is harvested and after the surface soil layer has been fully exposed to the sun as fertilizer for the cotton fields when plowing the land. According to his experience, this layer of surface soil has great fertility after being fully chemically processed by sunlight. Moreover, when this layer of surface soil is peeled off and used as fertilizer for cotton fields, the new soil in the wheat fields will continue to be exposed to sunlight, which can turn the dead soil below into living soil. When the cotton is harvested in autumn, the one- or two-cun (approximately 3-7 centimeters) thick surface soil that has been exposed to sunlight can be used as fertilizer for the wheat fields when plowing the cotton fields, and the lower layer of soil in the cotton fields can be exposed to sunlight. This experiment will show exactly what the specific fertilizer effect is? How much labor will it take? If the experiment is ideal, it can not only greatly increase the source of fertilizer and greatly reduce the labor consumption of transporting fertilizer from afar, but also gradually improve the soil and improve the soil fertility. Comrade Wang Baojing originally called his experiment "replacing fertilizer with light," but it seems more appropriate to call it "supplementing fertilizer with light." In order to prove this theory, Comrade Wang Baojing has specially selected three plots of land this year to conduct a comparative experiment. One is to use surface soil to topdress each other, one is to plant green manure and press it down, and the other is ordinary farming. The results of this experiment will be more obvious after the cotton is harvested this year and the wheat is harvested next year. He told the comrades of the Soil Biology Research Institute about the purpose of this experiment. They believe that it is reasonable and worthy of continued experimentation, because the soil that is turned up can increase the available phosphorus and available potassium after being exposed to the sun, improve the fertility of the soil, and give full play to the impact of soil fertility on crops.
            Replacing Surface Area with Lines and Replacing Surface Area with Points
    In order to make full use of sunlight, they also conducted some very interesting experiments. This year, they consciously retained the wheat seedlings growing on the edges of the fields and on the ridges. These isolated wheat seedlings growing in high places grew particularly well, with five or six cun long ears of wheat, and seven grains of wheat per "wheat hill" (the ordinary three grains, and very few five grains). We counted several ears, and each ear generally had more than one hundred grains. Why did it grow so well? Comrade Wang Baojing said that the main reason is that all sides are exposed to light. Based on this idea, he also conducted a large-area experiment called "Replacing Surface Area with Lines" and "Replacing Surface Area with Points," and has achieved remarkable results. "Replacing Surface Area with Lines" is to plow the land with a walking plow row by row, five chi apart, to sow rows of corn after the wheat is harvested, before there is time to plow all the land. Last year, they planted more than 70 mu in this way, and the actual harvest was more than 650 jin of corn per mu when calculated by mu (generally, more than 420 jin per mu). This year's wheat in these 70 mu yielded an average of more than 400 jin per mu, the same as the harvest of the original stubble wheat fields where no corn was sown. This method is to use a single-line sowing method row by row to replace a block-by-block continuous sowing method, so it is called "Replacing Surface Area with Lines." These rows of corn can get more sunlight, so the yield is higher.
    The biggest advantage of this "Replacing Surface Area with Lines" method is that it can solve one of the biggest contradictions in the wheat-producing areas of Guanzhong, that is, farmers are willing to plant more original stubble wheat and are unwilling to expand the area of replanting wheat, fearing that it will affect the wheat yield in the coming year. Although planting corn on wheat fields, as long as field management is strengthened, the total harvest of wheat plus corn can exceed the harvest of original stubble wheat, but farmers here are accustomed to focusing on wheat and disregarding corn. If they harvest less wheat, they think it is not worthwhile even if they harvest more corn. They believe that to plant more original stubble and harvest more wheat, they must replant less and harvest less autumn grain. Can this contradiction be resolved? Can both be achieved? The "Replacing Surface Area with Lines" method is a good way to solve this contradiction: it maintains the original stubble wheat fields and increases autumn grain income. To be on the safe side, they plan to conduct "Replacing Surface Area with Lines" experiments in the original stubble wheat fields this year, and further expand the distance between the single rows, expanding it to two zhang to two zhang five to plant a row of corn. According to Comrade Wang Baojing, even if this is discounted several times, at least 120 to 150 corn plants can be planted per mu of wheat field in this way, and at least 50 jin of corn can be harvested. At least 2 million jin of corn can be harvested in the entire commune's more than 40,000 mu of original stubble wheat fields. This method has been discussed by the commune's party committee and decided to first conduct larger-scale experiments on more than 1,500 mu of irrigated original stubble wheat and more than 600 mu of dry land on the plateau in the Fenghuo Team and the Xinglong Team this year.
    The "Replacing Surface Area with Points" method is to plant corn in wheat fields or cotton fields with wide row spacing and wide plant spacing, just like planting fruit trees. This year, they planted corn in this way in seven mu of cotton fields. Currently, the growth is very good, and the corn and cotton do not affect each other. If the final experiment proves that it has no impact on cotton, they plan to promote it in an all-round way next year. This "Replacing Surface Area with Points" method has a row spacing of six chi and a plant spacing of five chi (200 plants per mu), some have a row spacing of five chi and a plant spacing of five chi (300 plants per mu), and some have a row spacing of five chi and a plant spacing of four chi (400 plants per mu). According to Comrade Wang Baojing, in this way, without affecting the cotton harvest, dozens of jin of corn can be harvested per mu. If all the commune's more than 70,000 mu of cotton fields adopt this method, the commune can increase autumn grain production by more than one million jin just by this one item. In the effort to increase autumn grain in every possible way, this is also a good way.
              Experiment on Early Wheat Planting
    They also got an unexpected harvest. Based on this harvest, another valuable new experiment is being started, which is also closely related to fully utilizing sunlight. In March of this year, the wheat in their experimental fields and large fields lodged a lot after several wind and rain storms. However, during the process of rescuing the lodged wheat, a small piece of wheat standing upright was found in the experimental field. They decided to continue to observe this plot. From May 6th, there were several days of strong winds and heavy rains, and more of the surrounding wheat fields lodged, but the wheat in this small plot still stood strong and upright, without lodging. On May 24th, there was another heavy rain. At this time, other wheat had just begun to fill, and the grains of wheat in this plot were hard and close to maturity. Because the ears were too large and the upper part was too heavy, 35% of the ears showed signs of half-lodging. Most of these wheat plants were about four and seven-tenths chi high, the stalks were curved, and the ears were drooping, about two and eight-tenths chi from the ground, and had not fallen to the ground. This piece of wheat aroused the interest of Comrade Wang Baojing and a group of young scientific researchers, and they conducted an interesting study on it.
    This piece of wheat was also significantly resistant to rust. Only 10 days before harvest was it discovered that 29% of the wheat plants were infected with leaf rust, and even in the infected wheat plants, it was relatively mild, with only about 10% of the leaves infected and about 90% of the leaves still not infected.
    The ears of this wheat are also large, with the largest having one hundred and thirteen grains, the smallest having eleven grains, and generally about thirty grains. This plot is only one fen and nine li and five hao (approximately 0.13 hectares), it is an ordinary medium-fertile land, and it was sown with the Bima No. 1, which was infected with rust this year. It was fertilized with 40 jin of ammonium sulfate in the middle stage, and the management was the same as other large fields. However, this small plot harvested 253 jin. Assuming that it is converted to one mu, it would be more than 1,297 jin per mu. If this plot of land with one fen and nine li and five hao is calculated at 500 to 600 jin per mu for other high-yield large fields, it can only harvest 110 to 120 jin.
    So what is the difference between this small plot of land and other wheat fields? The main difference is that it was planted 40 days earlier. It was sown on September 10 last year, while most were sown between October 20 and 30. Why can early planting by 40 days resist lodging, resist rust, and increase yield? According to preliminary research by Wang Baojing and other comrades, the main reason may be that they have been exposed to sunlight for many more days than ordinary large fields. According to their light intensity measurements using a photometer, last September and October, there were an average of more than 37,000 meters of candlelight per day (that is, how much candlelight each square meter received). The early-sown wheat seedlings were entering a vigorous period of youth at this time, while the late-sown wheat seedlings would not return to green and grow until this spring, when there were only an average of 18,000 to 19,000 meters of candlelight per day. This early-sown wheat grew many leaves last winter. When the ground froze, the lower leaves froze to death. After returning to green this year, the lower leaves did not grow leaves, and the upper leaves were much smaller than the late-sown returned-green leaves. In this way, the wheat stalks, which have been trained by the cold winter, are more robust and harder at this time because the upper leaves are small and allow more light to penetrate, and the stems are more exposed to sunlight. The first section is short and strong. The first section of late-sown wheat is 11 cm to 14 cm, while the early-sown is only 3 cm to 4 cm, so the resistance to lodging is stronger. Why is the resistance to rust also stronger? According to their research, it is because the frost occurred soon after the rust began to occur last year, and the rust froze to death with the leaves; this year, the return to green, jointing, and heading of this plot were earlier than other plots. When the rust broke out this year, this wheat was already filling and close to maturity, and the leaves were old, so the rust was not very harmful.
      "Wheat has no second vigorous growth," this has been the experience of farmers for many years. They all say that if it grows vigorously in winter, it will definitely reduce production in the second year after being frozen. However, this wheat is contrary to this traditional saying. Comrade Wang Baojing believes that the ability to resist cold can also be improved. He said that the experience of Soviet academician Lysenko in domesticating wheat (that is, training seeds to adapt to new environments), turning winter wheat into spring wheat and spring wheat into winter wheat, can enhance the ability of wheat to resist cold, drought, and disease. Therefore, he believes that it is also possible to continue the early-sowing experiment of wheat and change the situation of "wheat having no second vigorous growth."
    This early-sowing experiment was not consciously carried out in advance. Last year, before sowing in the high-yield experimental field, in order to calculate the sowing amount, a preliminary experiment was conducted in this plot, and 50 jin of seeds were sown. The original plan was to turn it over and replant after the high-yield field was sown. Because they were busy with other work, no one managed it. Later, seeing that it was growing well, they decided to let it grow and try the result of early sowing. This year, in order to further experiment, they have decided to use four varieties (Bima No. 1, Qitouhong, 6028, and 2905). Starting from August 5 this year, they will sow once every five days until December 5. At the same time, they will domesticate the seeds harvested this year to further clarify the advantages and disadvantages of early sowing and to find out the growth law of early sowing.
    If this experiment is ideal and successful, there is another great advantage, that is, early sowing can be harvested early. This wheat was consciously harvested late this year (for the purpose of domesticating seeds), but it was still harvested seven to ten days earlier than ordinary wheat fields. In the wheat-producing areas of Guanzhong, thousands of miles of wheat fields mature in one day, and there is a rush to harvest and thresh, and there is a great shortage of labor during the harvest, which causes a great waste. Moreover, this area has to hire wheat harvesters to help with the harvest every year during wheat harvesting due to the shortage of labor. This year, the price of sickles for harvesting one mu of wheat is generally three to five yuan, that is to say, thirty to fifty jin of the harvest per mu goes to the harvesters as wages, which greatly affects the income of farmers. Therefore, if some wheat fields can mature and be harvested earlier, it will have a great impact on achieving a real bumper harvest after a bumper harvest and on truly increasing income after a bumper harvest.
    Communalization Promotes Scientific Research
    The scientific research work of the original Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative was relatively good. After the commune, it has developed even greater. There are more people truly engaged in scientific research, and the truly scientific experimental fields are larger. In the first half of last year, under the leadership of Comrade Wang Baojing, the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative established an agricultural science research office, but only a dozen people truly conducted scientific research with Comrade Baojing. They conducted serious scientific research experiments on only more than 30 mu of land. There were many other experimental fields, but they were scattered to various production teams. Some of them farmed carefully and had detailed records; some farmed well but had no scientific records; some farmed well sometimes and poorly at other times; and some "cut corners" and were very unserious. On September 1, last year, 31 neighboring agricultural cooperatives merged together to establish the Fenghuo People's Commune, and unanimously elected Comrade Wang Baojing as the president. A few days later, the commune's agricultural technology school was established, with Comrade Wang Baojing concurrently serving as the principal. 74 young people were drawn from various production teams, and 140 mu of land was allocated by the Fenghuo Brigade. At the same time, the scientific research office was reorganized and enriched, and the scientific research work here leaped forward by leaps and bounds.
    The establishment of this agricultural technology school was carried out under the enthusiastic demands of many people. Since 1952, the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative led by Wang Baojing has made great achievements in high-yield corn, etc. The surrounding agricultural cooperatives have also often sent people to the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative to visit and learn from Comrade Wang Baojing's experience. Therefore, the production experience here has long been spread around. However, because the time for visits and learning in various places is very short, some things have been learned, but some are still half-understood and have not been learned. For example, in 1955, Xiaoying Village sent a young man to learn about corn warm-water soaking, which should only be soaked for three hours, but it was soaked for a day and a night, making everyone laugh and cry. In 1956, the cotton high-yield field in Liang Village did not emerge evenly. Several girls heard that Wang Baojing used urea to remedy it, so they took several bags of urea, resulting in the cotton growing wildly. Some people in the village said: "It would be easy if our village and Fenghuo were in the same cooperative." Therefore, when the proposal was made for Wang Baojing to run an agricultural technology school to train the technical forces of various production teams, many teams agreed. Some teams did not agree much at first, and sent people to the school as if they were being assigned a task. Later, the people who came to study were also willing, and the teams were also willing. During the reorganization of the entire commune this spring, some people once advocated that the number of students in agricultural schools should be reduced. The students were very sad when they heard this news and were very afraid of being asked to drop out of school. Usually, the school's cafeteria makes two pots of meat dishes, which are always eaten up. This time, everyone felt uncomfortable when they heard this bad news, and two pots of meat dishes were made, but one pot was not finished.
    Characteristics of the Fenghuo Commune Agricultural Technology School:
        Focus on practical operation; Close contact with production teams; Running schools diligently and thriftily
    The characteristics of this school are that it focuses on practical operation. Two-thirds of the day is spent on labor, and one-third is spent on class. When planting cotton, they talk about cotton. When preventing rust, they talk about rust. The main focus is on practically learning the high-yield experience of various crops, and connecting scientific theory in specific operations. Therefore, some students with only a rudimentary level of literacy can keep up with the learning.
    The students in this school have a very close relationship with their own production teams in their studies. As soon as they learn any new technology or good experience, they immediately teach it. The school has a two-week break once every two weeks, and the students return to the team to teach. The team often comes to the school to ask about any problems in crops. The school has also established four branch schools in the commune, each with a dozen or twenty people. These people are also active in spreading advanced experience in the school. This year, with the help of the students of the school and the branch schools, all the cotton in the commune is planted in "Wen Wu Hang", and the corn cultivation has also learned the advanced experience of the Fenghuo Team; this year, after the wheat returned to green, in terms of pest control, lodging prevention, and rust prevention, the school truly played the role of a living technical extension station. When the school first opened, some farmers said: "What can those clumsy hands and feet learn?" Now, when they see the students returning, they all smile and say: "Our college students are back!" "Our village also has talent!"
    This school implements the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily. There are no school buildings, and classes are held in the courtyard. There are no dormitories, and a few rooms have been borrowed from the people. Some people even sleep in the passage of the gate. Meals are brought by themselves. When they first came, the production team recorded work points. Now that the summer grain has been harvested, they have gradually become self-sufficient. They plant the 140 mu of land of the Fenghuo Brigade, and now they also hand over food and cotton to the Fenghuo Brigade according to the contracted output target, just like ordinary production teams. At first, some individuals in the Fenghuo Team had opinions on the school occupying their land. Later, the problem was solved by contracting output. In fact, the school is in this production team, which is close to the water and gets the moon first. The school has helped the most in promoting many new technologies. During the assault tasks, the students often enthusiastically support this production team.
    Because this commune does a good job in production and scientific research, many people often come to visit. The province and the county helped them build a guest house. Now the agricultural technology school can benefit from the guest house and can use the new house of the guest house for classes and accommodation.
    A very important and superior condition of this school is that not only are there farmer scientists Wang Baojing and old farmers with technology like Ma Shuxiu as teachers, but there are also two professors from the Northwest Agricultural College and comrades from the Agricultural Biology Research Institute who have been sent down to the commune as their teachers. Sixteen students from the Northwest Agricultural College who were sent down to labor also provided them with a lot of enthusiastic help.
    The students of this school graduate in one year, and another group comes again. The commune party committee and the commune management committee decided to train all young farmers in the commune in rotation for one year. Their great ideal is to train all young farmers into farmers with scientific knowledge, and to train a group of agricultural technicians and try to establish an agronomist system in the commune to strengthen the technical management of crops. They also hope to train more farmer scientists like Wang Baojing. A bright prospect will be presented to us: more and more farmers with scientific knowledge, under the guidance of more farmer scientists, will carry out more scientific management of agricultural production. The agricultural scientific research work and the entire agricultural production work of the Fenghuo People's Commune will achieve more and more fruitful results year by year.

    充分利用阳光是增加农作物生产的一项十分重要的条件。八字宪法里合理密植一项就包含有如何利用阳光的问题。但阳光对农作物的作用，恐怕是值得研究的专门问题。他们今年在这方面的试验工作得到了很宝贵的成就。为什么有些小块试验田过分密植反而长不好？耕得浅吗？不，都是深耕二尺左右；肥不足吗？不，都是每亩十几万斤以上。最主要原因，就是太密，缺乏阳光。烽火社的小麦密植对比试验田看得很明显，一亩地三、四十万穗最好，再密，就越密越坏。但是你去看看所有长得很密的试验田，中间的麦子长得不好，但是四边边行的麦子还是长得很好，根据烽火社几块试验田的情况，边行的产量比中间的增产40％到60％。为什么边行就长得好呢？因为有比较充足的阳光。在烽火社的试验田里，还有各种各样耕地地形设计，有阳坡式，有圆坡式，有凸形式等等，他们有比较详细的光照强度的科学记载，凡是长得比较好的小麦，都是得到阳光比较充分的地方。根据这一原理，今年烽火公社的全部棉花和全部玉米，都采用了“文武行”的播种法，就是把原来均匀的行距改为两行很靠紧、两行大隔开的办法，增加阳光的照晒（如玉米，两行靠紧的行距一尺五，双行和双行相距四尺）。
          宽行间作套种的耕作制度
    烽火公社利用阳光的试验，得到了新的成果，就是他们叫的“宽行间作套种的耕作制度”。这个试验已经进行了四年，由1955年二分地的试验，扩大到今年的六十亩地。现在这块大面积丰产田已经得到了很大的丰收，亩产五百一十四斤，单从收获量来说，比一般麦田增产123％。在这六十亩大面积试验田里，划分成五尺宽和三尺宽的小块，在三尺行内播种小麦，在五尺行内播种棉花。两种作物交差下种，各有自己的旺盛时期，在麦子的旺盛时期，棉花还很短小，它所占据那五尺宽行，实际上等于空地，因而三尺行的麦子能得到比较充足的阳光，麦子长得秆低、茎粗、穗大、未倒伏、锈病轻、产量高。看一看这种间作试验田和大田生长情况的记录吧：同样是碧蚂一号品种，同样的耕作技术，但是在间作套种试验田里和七丈宽的普通耕作大田里，却得到不同的效果。		试验田		大田		比　较穗　数		28.8万穗	25.5万穗	多3.3万穗株　高		116厘米		131.8厘米	低15.8厘米第一节茎长	8.22厘米	12.4厘米	短4.18厘米第二节茎长	16.88厘米	18.5厘米	短1.62厘米						所以试验田未倒						伏，大田出穗时						就倒伏一半。每穗平均粒数	29.1粒		19.1粒		多10粒每千粒平均重	34.1克		28.1克		重6克亩产量	514斤		230.7斤		增产123％
    种在这大块试验田五尺播幅里的棉花，在初期虽然受到两旁小麦的阴蔽，幼苗较弱，但棉蚜很少，因为正当棉蚜在大田里蔓延为害的时候，很多蚜虫落在两旁高大的小麦上。现在小麦收割以后，已经收割了小麦的三尺宽麦地，又反过来成为棉苗通风透光的大走廊，从7月底的情况看，这块地里的棉苗长得很好，一般棉田里棉苗发生虫害的株数达到60％—70％，这块地的棉苗只有12％；另外，因为阳光比较其他棉田充足，基本上没有疯长现象，这也是比其它棉田好的地方。去年间作田的试验结果，不只小麦比大田增产一倍以上，去年的棉花虽然遭到了水灾，产量还是比大田增产20％以上。去年下半年开始试验玉米和小麦的宽行间作套种的一亩小块试验田，也得到突出的成果，去秋收玉米一千七百三十七点一斤，玉米行中宽幅种小豆作了绿肥，去冬翻压后种小麦，今年小麦又收一千一百六十七点四斤。
    这种宽行间作套种制度，究竟小麦和棉花的播幅以多宽为好，棉花各种播幅的比较试验要到秋后才能看出来，今年小麦各种播幅的对比试验，结果证明三尺宽的效果最好。
    在6月16日到18日的公社小麦生产经验总结会上，大家对于这种新的耕作制度感到很大兴趣。会上订出了一个宽行间作套种的五年轮作制度。都分三尺宽的播幅，第一二年甲行种绿肥和小麦，乙行种棉花；第三四年甲乙行互换，甲行种棉花，乙行种绿肥和小麦；第五年仍按普通大田耕作全种小麦，麦收后再种玉米。烽火公社初步制订出来的规划草案如下：区别  年份 第一年	第二年   第三年     第四年    第五年一区 甲行   麦子＋绿肥 麦子＋绿肥 棉花       棉花

                                                        ＋绿肥
    假定实行这种耕作制度，以烽火社烽火生产队为例，把两千亩土地划为五个轮作区，每年可种小麦一千二百亩，棉花八百亩，回种玉米四百亩和绿肥八百亩（其中可以收豆子二百亩），这样，由于充分利用了阳光，轮茬使用肥料和轮流种绿肥，使地力越种越好，在现在栽培技术水平上，比较可靠地估计，每年可收小麦五十二万斤，玉米二十四万斤，棉花一千二百担。
    现在烽火生产队已经规划土地，先进行一百亩的大面积生产试验。
              以光补肥
    在这项试验中，王保京同志对于使用肥料和改良土壤方面还有一个十分值得重视的新目的。他准备在间作套种田里，当小麦收割后的小麦地块的表面土层经过阳光充分曝晒以后，在翻地的时候，把这层一两寸厚的表土作为肥料上到棉花地里去。根据他的经验，这层表土经过日光曝晒以后，经过充分的化学作用，肥力很大。而且当这层表土剥去作棉花地的肥料以后，小麦地里的新土又会继续受到日光的曝晒，可以使下面的死土变为活土。等到秋天棉花收获以后，又可以在翻棉地时把经过日光曝晒的一二寸厚的表土作为肥料上到麦地里去，棉地里的下层土壤又可受到日光曝晒。这种试验将会表明究竟具体的肥效如何？究竟要花多少劳动力？如果试验合乎理想，不只可以大大增加肥源，可以大大减少从远处运肥的劳动力消耗，还可以逐渐改善土壤，提高地力。王保京同志原来把他这种试验叫作“以光代肥”，看起来叫作“以光补肥”比较适当。为了证明这个理论，王保京同志今年特意选了三块地来作对比试验，一块是用表土互相追肥，一种是种绿肥压肥，一种是普通作务，到今年收棉和明年收麦以后就可以更明显地看出这一试验结果。他把这一试验的目的告诉过土壤生物研究所的同志，他们认为有道理值得继续试验，因为翻起来的土，经过太阳的曝晒，可以增加速效磷和速效钾，提高了土壤的肥力，充分发挥土壤的肥效对庄稼的影响。
            以线代面和以点代面
    为了充分利用阳光，他们还作了一些很有意思的试验。他们今年把长在地边田埂上的麦苗有意识地保留下来，这种孤零零长在高处的麦苗，生长特别好，麦穗五、六寸长，一个“麦山”七颗麦粒（普通三颗，五颗的就很少），我们数了几穗，一穗大都在一百粒以上。为什么长得这样好呢？王保京同志说，最主要也是四面都透光。根据这种思想，他还作了一种叫做“以线代面”和“以点代面”的大面积试验，而且已经得到显著的成绩。“以线代面”，就是在麦子收割以后，在来不及全部翻地以前，用步犁五尺一行一行地犁一下，种下一行一行的玉米。去年，他们这样种了七十多亩，秋后按亩折算，每亩实收玉米六百五十多斤（一般每亩收四百二十多斤）。今年这七十亩地的小麦，每亩平均收四百多斤，和完全没有捎种玉米的原茬麦地的收成一样。这种办法，就是用一行一行的单线播种法来代替一块一块的连片播种法，所以叫“以线代面”。这一条线一条线的玉米因为能得到更多的阳光，所以产量较高。
    这种“以线代面”办法的最大好处，它可以解决关中麦产地区一个最大的矛盾，就是农民愿意多种原茬麦，不愿意扩大麦地复种面积，怕影响来年的小麦产量。虽然小麦地种回茬玉米，只要加强田间管理，拿小麦加上玉米的总收获量来说是可以超过原茬小麦的收成，但这里的农民在生活习惯上重小麦轻玉米，如果少收了一些麦子，那怕多收了较多的玉米，也认为是不合算的。他们认为，要多种原茬多收麦子，就要少复种少收秋粮。这个矛盾能不能解决？能不能两者兼得？“以线代面”的办法就是解决这个矛盾的一个好办法：既保持了原茬麦地，又增加了秋粮收入。为了更保险起见，他们计划今年在原茬麦地里进行“以线代面”的试验，更加扩大了单行与单行间的距离，扩大到两丈到两丈五播种一行玉米。据王保京同志说，这样打几次折扣，一亩小麦地这样捎种的玉米至少可种一百二十到一百五十棵，至少可收玉米五十斤，全公社四万多亩原茬麦地，就至少可以收二百万斤玉米。这个办法，已经经过公社党委会讨论过，决定今年先在烽火队和兴隆队的一千五百多亩水地原茬麦和塬上旱地六百多亩作更大面积的试验。
    “以点代面”的办法，就像种果树一样宽行距宽株距地在小麦地里或棉花地里捎种玉米，今年他们在七亩棉田内这样种了玉米，目前，生长很好，玉米与棉花互不影响。如果最后试验证明对棉花也没有什么影响，明年他们就打算全面推广。这种“以点代面”的方法，有的是六尺行距五尺株距（每亩二百株），有的是五尺行距五尺株距（每亩三百株），有的是五尺行距四尺株距（每亩四百株）。据王保京同志谈，这样，在不影响棉花收成的情况下，一亩地还可以多收几十斤玉米。如果全社七万多亩棉田都采用这个办法，单只这一项，全社又可以多增产秋粮百多万斤。在千方百计增加秋粮的努力中，这也是一个好办法。
              小麦早种的试验
    他们还得到一个意外的收获，根据这一收获正开始着另一项很有价值的新试验，这也是和充分利用阳光有密切关系的试验。在今年3月，在他们的试验田里和大田里的小麦，经过几次风雨以后，倒伏了很多。但在抢救倒伏的过程中，在试验田里发现一小块小麦笔直地站着，没有倒伏。他们决定对这块地进行继续观察。从5月6日起连着五六天大风大雨，周围的麦地倒伏更多，这小块地的小麦仍然健壮地直立着，没有倒伏。5月24日，又一次大雨，这时，其他小麦才开始灌浆，这块地的小麦颗子已硬，接近成熟，因为穗子过大、上部过重，有35％的麦穗出现半倒伏现象，这部分麦株大都高四点七尺左右，麦秆弯曲，麦穗下垂，距地面还有二点八尺左右，并没有倒到地面。这一块小麦引起了王保京同志和一群青年科学研究者的兴趣，他们对它进行了有趣的研究。
    这块小麦在抵抗锈病的能力方面也很显著。直到收割前十天才发现有29％的麦株染上了叶锈病，而且就在染病的麦株中，也比较轻微，只有约10％的叶子感染，约90％的叶子仍然不感染。
    这块麦的麦穗也大，最大的有一百一十三粒，最小的十一粒，一般都在三十粒左右。这块地只有一分九厘五毫，是一般中等肥地，播种的也是今年感染锈病的碧蚂一号，中期上过四十斤硫酸錏，在管理方面和其他大田一样。但是这小块地却收获了二百五十三斤。假定要折成一亩计算，每亩就是一千二百九十七斤多。如果这一分九厘五的地块，按其他高产的大田亩产五六百斤算，也只能收一百一二十斤。
    那么这一小块地和其他麦田究竟有什么不同呢？最主要的不同就是早种四十多天，是去年9月10日下种的，一般都在10月20日至30日下种。为什么早种四十多天就能抗倒伏、抗锈病、产量高呢？据王保京和其他同志初步研究，认为最主要的原因可能是比一般大田多晒了很多天阳光，据他们用光度计进行的光度测算，去年9月和10月，平均每天有三万七千多米烛光（就是每平方米受到多少烛光），早播的麦苗正在这时进入蓬勃的青春时期，而迟种的麦苗要到今年春天才返青生长，这时，平均每天只有一万八九千米烛光。这块早播的麦子，去年冬天就长了很多叶子，到地冻时，下部的叶子都冻死了，今年返青以后，下面不长叶子，上面的叶子比迟种返青的叶子细小得多，这样，经过一个冬天寒冷锻炼的麦茎，这时又因为上面叶子细小，透光较多，茎秆受到日光曝晒较多，所以就比迟种的粗壮和坚硬得多，第一节长得短而壮，迟种的第一节是十一公分至十四厘米，早种的只三四厘米，所以抗倒伏力比较强。为什么抗锈力也较强呢？据他们研究：就是在去年开始发生锈病时很快就霜冻，锈病就和叶子一起冻死了；到今年，这块地返青、拔节、抽穗都比其他地早，到今年锈病大发时，这块麦已灌浆接近成熟，叶子也老了，所以锈病危害不大。
      “麦无二旺”，这是多少年来农民的经验，都说冬天旺长了，受冻后第二年一定减产。但是这块麦和这种传统的说法相反。王保京同志认为抗寒能力也是可以改进的。他说苏联李森科院士进行小麦训化（就是训练种子适应新环境）的经验，冬麦变春麦、春麦变冬麦，就可以增强小麦的抗寒、抗旱和抗病害的能力。所以他认为继续进行小麦早种试验，改变“麦无二旺”的情况也是可能的。
    这块地的早种试验，事先并不是有意识进行的。去年，在高额丰产试验田播种前，为了计算播种量，就在这块地里进行了预备试验，播下了五十斤种子，原打算等丰产田播种以后就翻掉另种，因忙于其他工作没有人管它，以后见它长得不错，就决定让它生长下去，试一试早种的结果。今年为了进一步试验，他们已经决定用四个品种（碧蚂一号、齐头红、六零二八、二九零五），从今年8月5日开始，每五天种一次，一直种到12月5日，同时把今年收下的种子进行训化，进一步摸清早种的优缺点，摸出早种的生长规律。
    这个试验如果合乎理想，得到成功，还有另外一个很大的好处，就是早种可以早收，这块麦今年有意识地迟收（为了训化种籽），还是比普通麦田早收了七天到十天。在关中麦产区，千里麦田，一晌成熟，抢收抢打，龙口夺食，收割时劳动力十分紧张，浪费很大。而且，在每年割麦时由于劳动力紧张，这一带都要雇麦客帮助收割，今年割一亩麦，镰价一般都在三至五元，就是说每亩收获的三五十斤作为麦客的工价去了，这是很影响农民的收入的。所以，如果有一部分麦田能提早成熟提早收割，对丰产后能够真正丰收、对丰收后能够真正增加收入，都有很大的作用。
    公社化促进了科学研究工作
    原来的烽火农业社的科学研究工作就是比较好的。公社化后有了更大的发展，真正从事科学研究的人多了，真正科学性的试验田大了。去年上半年烽火农业社在王保京同志的领导下成立了农业科学研究室，但是真正和保京同志在一起进行科学研究的只有十几个人，他们认真进行科学研究的试验只有三十多亩地，其他试验田是很多，但都分散到各生产队，这中间有的认真作务，有详细的记载；有的作务虽很好但无科学记载；有的作务时好时差；有的还“偷工减料”很不认真。去年9月1日，靠近的三十一个农业社合在一起，成立烽火人民公社，一致推举王保京同志作社长。几天以后就办起了公社农业技术学校，王保京同志兼校长，由各生产队抽调出七十四个青年，由烽火大队拨出一百四十亩土地，同时整顿和充实了科学研究室，这里的科学研究工作就大踏步地跃进起来了。
    成立这个农业技术学校是在很多群众热烈要求下办起来的。从1952年起，王保京领导的烽火农业社在玉米丰产等方面作出了很大的成绩，周围的农业社也常常派人到烽火农业社来参观，向王保京同志学习经验，因而这里的生产经验，在周围早有传播。但因各地来参观学习，时间都很短，有些东西学到了，有些仍是一知半解，并没有学会，比如1955年小应村派了个青年来学习玉米温汤浸种，本来只应该浸三个钟头，结果浸了一天一夜，弄得大家哭笑不得。1956年梁村的棉花丰产田出苗不齐，几个姑娘听说王保京用上尿素的办法来补救，她们就冒上了几袋尿素，结果弄得棉花拼命疯长，村里有的群众就说：“要是咱村和烽火是一个社就好办事了。”所以一提出由王保京出来办农业技术学校，培养各生产队的技术力量，很多队都赞成，有的队开初不大赞成，像支差一样派了人上学校，以后，来学的人也愿意了，队里也愿意了。今春整社时，曾经有人主张农业学校的学生要减少一些人，同学们听到这个消息以后，十分难过，很怕让自己退学。平常，学校的食堂作两锅肉菜，总是吃得光光的，这次大家听到这个不好的消息，很多人吃饭都难受，做了两锅肉菜，一锅也没有吃完。
    烽火公社农业技术学校的特点：
        以实际操作为主；密切联系生产队；勤俭办学
    这个学校的特点是以实际操作为主，一天三分之二的时间劳动，三分之一上课，种棉花就讲棉花，防锈病就讲锈病，主要是实际学习各种作物的丰产经验，在具体操作中联系科学理论。所以有的学生的文化程度只是粗识字，也跟得上学习。
    这个学校的学生在学习中和自己生产队有很密切的联系，一学到什么新技术和好经验，立刻就进行传授。学校每两周放一次假，由学员回队传授。队里在作物方面有什么问题，也常常找到学校来。学校在全社还办了四个分校，每个分校还有十几二十个人，这些人也是学校传授先进经验的积极分子。今年在学校和分校学员的帮助下，全社的棉花都种的
  “文武行”，玉米耕作也都学的烽火队的先进经验；今年小麦返青后，在防虫、防倒伏、防锈病等等方面，学校真正发挥了活的技术推广站的作用。学校开办时，有的农民说：“送去那些粗手笨胳膊，能学个啥？”如今一见学员回来，都笑着说：“咱们的大学生回来了！”“我们村里也有了人才了！”
    这个学校贯彻了勤俭办学校的精神，没有修校舍，在院子里上课。没有修宿舍，借了群众几间房，有的人还睡在大门的过道里。伙食由自己带来，初来时由生产队记工分，现在夏粮收下来了，他们已逐步走向自给自足。他们种的是烽火大队的一百四十亩地，现在也按普通生产小队那样，向烽火大队按包产指标交食粮和棉花。开初，烽火队有个别人对学校占用了他们的土地有意见，以后进行了包产，解决了这个问题。其实，学校在这个生产队，对这个队来说是近水楼台先得月，很多新技术的推广，得到学校的帮助最多。在突击任务时，学员们还常常热情地支援这个生产队。
    这个公社因为生产和科学研究工作做得好，经常来参观访问的人很多，省上和县上帮助他们修了一个招待所。现在农业技术学校可以沾招待所的光，可以利用招待所的新房子来上课和住宿。
    这个学校的一个很重要的优越条件，不仅有农民科学家王保京和像马书秀这样有技术的老农作教员，而且还有下放到社里的两个西北农学院的教授和农业生物研究所的同志作他们的教员。西北农学院十六个下放劳动的学生对他们也作了很多热情的帮助。
    这个学校的学生一年毕业，毕业一批再来一批，公社党委会和社管委会决定把全社青年农民都轮流训练一年，他们的远大理想是把全体青年农民都培养成有科学常识的农民，而且培养出一批农业技术人员，试着在全社建立农艺师制度，加强对农作物的技术管理。他们还希望培养出更多的像王保京那样的农民科学家。一个美好的远景将展现在我们面前：越来越多的有科学知识的农民，在更多的农民科学家的指导下，对农业生产进行着更科学的管理，烽火人民公社的农业科学研究工作和整个农业生产工作，将会一年一年地得到更加丰硕的成果。
