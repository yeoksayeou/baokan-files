　　In the past, we saw Soviet original films with Chinese subtitles on the wide screen. Because at that time, Chinese film studios could not dub and copy wide-screen films due to technical limitations. Now, "The Captain's Daughter" that we see on the wide screen of the Capital Cinema is already a dubbed version with Chinese dialogue. This is something to be celebrated.

　　Coincidentally, "The Captain's Daughter" is the first wide-screen dubbed film shown in China today, and Pushkin's novel of the same name was the first Russian literary work introduced to China more than half a century ago (1903). At that time, it was published in China under the names "Russian Romance" and "Record of Fickle Butterfly Dreams." About 20 years later, the same novel appeared in a translation as "Captain's Daughter," and more than 20 years later, the translation "The Captain's Daughter" appeared. It can be seen that this is a work of great commemorative significance in the "exchange between Chinese and Russian texts."

　　"The Captain's Daughter" is a novel written by Pushkin a year before his death (1836), known for its realism, sincerity, simplicity, and conciseness. Tolstoy once praised it as the pinnacle of all of Pushkin's works.

　　This novel is known for its simplicity, and the film adapted from it also has simplicity as its characteristic. What is presented on the wide screen is the real scene of the largest peasant war in Russian history from 1773 to 1775 – the peasant uprising led by Pugachev.

　　Young Sergeant Pyotr Grinev is sent to serve under Captain Mironov at the Belogorsk Fortress in the border region. He falls in love with the captain's daughter, Masha. For the sake of love, Grinev duels with another young officer, Alexei Shvabrin, several times. After the peasant uprising led by Pugachev occupied the Belogorsk Fortress, the captain refused to surrender and was hanged. The captain's wife was also killed, and the captain's daughter hid in the home of a local priest, which saved her life. Grinev's head was already on the noose, but because he had helped Pugachev when he was poor, Pugachev pardoned him. His rival in love, Shvabrin, had surrendered to Pugachev beforehand. Pugachev persuaded Grinev to submit and join the great cause, but his heart was entirely on Masha, and he did not agree. Shvabrin attempted to possess Masha, and Grinev accused him to Pugachev, who then sentenced Masha to him. Later, Pugachev was defeated and captured, and someone accused Grinev of "joining the rebellion," and he was arrested and imprisoned. Masha, using her identity as a descendant of a martyred guard general, traveled a long distance to St. Petersburg to plead with the Empress to release her lover. A young couple who had experienced war and suffering finally became a family, but Pugachev, who truly gave them life and happiness, was beheaded and displayed to the public amidst the weeping of the people.

　　"The Captain's Daughter" is such a story of joy and sorrow, separation and reunion. Rather than saying that Pushkin wanted to write this moving love story, it is better to say that he wanted to write the history of the peasant hero Pugachev's uprising. Pushkin had carefully studied that uprising that shook the entire Russia, collected a lot of materials, and also went to the place of the uprising to conduct field investigations. He completely sympathized with the peasant uprising. He wrote "History of Pugachev," but the Tsar changed it to "History of the Pugachev Rebellion." Pushkin was very dissatisfied. Later, he used the form of a novel to write this history, but many parts were still deleted by the censor when it was published.

　　The "romance" of the captain's daughter is laid out on the history of Pugachev's uprising, and Pugachev's heroic image is meticulously depicted through the "romance" of the captain's daughter. The magnificent peasant battles and the tortuous and moving love of young men and women are intertwined into an immortal work, breaking through the Tsar's censorship system and meeting with the vast number of readers. Now the film successfully reproduces on the screen the revolutionary ideas, wisdom, courage, and chivalrous enthusiasm of Pugachev, which readers are familiar with from Pushkin's writing. The screenwriter and director filmed several important plots that were censored by the Tsar and written by the author but never published. For example, the gallows with three rebels hanging on them floating on a raft on the river, showing the Tsar's brutality, these shots are all efforts made by the filmmakers to restore the original appearance of the work.

　　The film realistically shows the life of the Tsar's army nearly two hundred years ago. Ridiculous scenes such as fighting like child's play, mixing family matters with war matters, etc.; it depicts the fighting appearance of the uprising peasants of various ethnic groups in Russia, using the characteristics of the wide screen to show the great paintings of peasants rising up in revolt, the magnificent scenes of marching, and the moving mass scenes when Pugachev was executed. In the handling of the characters' personalities, they are also able to conform to the spirit of the original work.

### 花心蝶梦宽银幕

    花心蝶梦宽银幕
    蔡云
    过去我们在宽银幕上看到的是加印中文字幕的苏联原版片。因为那时我国电影制片厂由于技术上的限制还不能配音复制宽银幕影片。现在我们在首都电影院宽银幕上看到的“上尉的女儿”已经是华语对白的翻版片。这是值得庆贺的一件事情。
    无独有偶，“上尉的女儿”是今天中国放映的第一部宽银幕翻版片，而普希金的这部同名小说是半个多世纪以前（1903年）第一部介绍到中国来的俄国文学作品。当时是用“俄国情史”和“花心蝶梦录”的名称在中国出版的。之后约二十年，同一小说出现“甲必丹之女”的译本，又过了二十多年，出现“上尉的女儿”的译本。可见这是一部在“中俄文字之交”中有重大纪念意义的作品。
    “上尉的女儿”是普希金在他逝世前一年（1836年）写成的小说，以写实、真挚、朴素、简洁著称。托尔斯泰曾把它赞为普希金全部作品中的最高峰。
    这部小说以朴素见称，拍成的影片也以朴素为其特点。展现在宽大的银幕上的是1773—1775年俄国历史上最大的一次农民战争——布加乔夫领导的农民起义时代的真实景象。
    青年彼得·格里?夫中士被派到边区别洛戈尔炮台米罗诺夫上尉的部下服务。他爱上了上尉的女儿玛莎。为了爱情，格里?夫曾几次和另一个青年军官阿列克赛·施伐布林决斗。布加乔夫领导的农民起义队伍攻占别洛戈尔炮台后，上尉不肯投降，被绞死，上尉的妻子也被杀死，上尉的女儿躲到当地一个牧师家，得以保全生命。格里?夫的头已挂在绞索上，因为他曾帮助过穷困时的布加乔夫，布赦免了他。他的情敌施伐布林事前已投降布加乔夫。布劝格里?夫归顺，共襄大举，但他的心全在玛莎身上，没有答应。施伐布林企图占有玛莎，格里?夫向布加乔夫控告，布便把玛莎判给了他。后来布加乔夫战败被俘，有人指控格里?夫“附逆作乱”，被捕下狱。玛莎用殉职守将遗族的身份，长途跋涉，到彼得堡去向女皇求情，释放她的爱人。一对饱经战乱忧患的少年情人终成眷属，但是真正给予他们生命和幸福的布加乔夫却在万民吞泣声中被斩首示众了。
    “上尉的女儿”就是这样一个悲欢离合的故事。与其说普希金要写这个动人的恋爱故事，不如说他要写布加乔夫这个农民英雄的起义历史。普希金曾仔细研究过那次震动全俄的起义事件，搜集了很多材料，还到起义地方去实地调查过，他是完全同情农民起义的。他写了“布加乔夫历史”，但被沙皇改为“布加乔夫暴动历史”。普希金很不满意。后来他用小说形式来写这部历史，可是在发表时还是有好多地方被检查官删掉了。
    上尉女儿的“情史”是铺陈在布加乔夫起义史上的，而布加乔夫的英雄形象，则是通过上尉女儿的“情史”来着力加意描绘的。轰轰烈烈的农民战斗和曲折动人的儿女爱情交织成一部不朽作品，冲破了沙皇的检查制度，和广大读者见面。现在影片成功地把读者从普希金笔下所熟悉的布加乔夫的革命思想、智慧胆略、侠义热情等特点再现在银幕上。编剧和导演把沙皇检查掉的和作者写了而未曾发表的几段重要情节拍入影片。例如，吊着三个起义者的绞架用木筏漂流在河上，表现沙皇的残暴，这些镜头都属于影片制作者为恢复原作本来面目所做的努力。
    影片写实地表现了将近二百年前沙皇军队的生活。他们像儿戏似地作战，家事和战事混在一起等可笑场面；描绘了俄国各民族起义农民的战斗面貌，利用宽银幕的特点，表现农民揭竿而起的伟大画幅，行军的宏伟图景，布加乔夫就义时动人的群众场面。在人物性格的处理上，也都能符合原作的精神。
