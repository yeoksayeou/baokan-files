    Xinjiang Begins Sowing Winter Wheat
    Henan Province Issues Autumn Planting Work Plan
    Our newspaper's Urumqi dispatch, 6th. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has begun sowing winter wheat on the boundless plains of the Manas River basin. Currently, in various reclamation areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, powerful tractor fleets are working day and night, rushing to plow, level land, and the sowing of winter wheat is gradually progressing from north to south.
    This year, the Production and Construction Corps decided to sow 2.05 million mu of winter wheat, an expansion of 82% compared to last year's winter wheat sowing area, and 2.8 times that of 1957. This year, various reclamation areas have reclaimed more than 700,000 mu, and most of the winter wheat is sown on fertile newly reclaimed land. The winter wheat sowing work was started early. At the beginning of July, each farm rushed to harvest the summer crops, and at the same time selected land with sufficient fertility and good soil as winter wheat land; some wheat stubble land that had just been harvested was immediately deep-plowed by tractor drivers. During the busy days of field management in June and July, many tractor drivers in charge of cultivating and weeding here cultivated during the day and transported fertilizer to the prepared wheat fields in the evening, maximizing the efficiency of the machinery. In order to ensure the irrigation and alkali washing of the winter wheat fields, the farm's leading cadres and workers worked day and night to divert the floodwaters of the Manas River for irrigation.
    While expanding the winter wheat sowing area, the Production and Construction Corps particularly emphasized the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, in order to increase the yield per unit area of wheat.

    Our newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch, 6th. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial People's Council recently issued a "Plan on Doing a Good Job in Autumn Planting and Striving for a Greater Harvest of Wheat in 1960."
    This plan proposes that the province plans to guarantee the completion of 80 million mu for this year's autumn planting area, and strive to exceed it. Among them, 70 million mu of wheat, 9 million mu of summer coarse grains, and 1 million mu of rapeseed. Large-area high-yield fields should account for 20%-30% of the autumn sowing area. It is required to plant well and fully, rationally densely, sow at the right time, and ensure that autumn-sown crops are planted well under any drought conditions. At present, the time for autumn sowing is very tight, and it is necessary to mobilize the whole people and make full preparations.

    新疆开始播种冬小麦
    河南省订出秋播工作方案
    本报乌鲁木齐6日电　新疆军区生产建设兵团已在玛纳斯河流域一望无际的平原上，开始播种冬小麦。目前，在天山南北各个垦区的强大拖拉机群，正日夜出动，突击耕翻、平整土地，播种冬小麦的工作正在由北向南逐步推进。
    今年，生产建设兵团决定播种冬小麦二百零五万亩，比去年冬麦播种面积扩大82％，比1957年扩大二点八倍。今年各垦区已开荒七十多万亩，冬小麦大部分播种在肥沃的新垦荒地上。冬麦播种工作抓得早。7月初，各农场一面突击夏收，一面就选择肥力足、土壤良好的土地作为冬麦地；一些麦收刚完毕的麦茬地，拖拉机手紧接着就进行深翻。在6、7月田间管理繁忙的日子里，这里不少农场担任中耕除草的拖拉机手，白天中耕，晚上往事先准备好的麦地运送肥料，最大限度地发挥机械效能。为了保证冬麦地的灌溉、洗碱，农场的领导干部和职工们日夜抢引玛纳斯河洪水灌溉。
    生产建设兵团在扩大冬麦播种面积的同时，特别重视贯彻农业“八字宪法”，提高小麦单位面积产量。　　　　　　（李东炎）
    本报郑州6日电　中共河南省委、河南省人民委员会，最近发出“关于做好秋播工作，争取1960年小麦更大丰收的方案”。
    这个方案提出，全省计划今年秋播面积保证完成八千万亩，要争取超过。其中小麦七千万亩，夏杂粮九百万亩，油菜一百万亩。大面积丰产方要占秋播面积的20％—30％。要求种好种足，合理密植，播种适时，保证在任何干旱的情况下，都要求把秋播作物种好。目前距秋播时间已很紧迫，必须全民动员，充分准备。
