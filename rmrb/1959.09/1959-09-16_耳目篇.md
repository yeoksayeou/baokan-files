Ear and Eye

　　Why are human ears and eyes in pairs? Originally, it was for a better understanding of the objective world.

　　When sound comes, it arrives at the left and right ears at different times, and the loudness is not the same. The brain then uses this to distinguish where the sound comes from. This is called the binaural effect.

　　Looking at things with both eyes, the angles are different, and the resulting vision is also different. In this way, it is possible to judge the distance of various parts of an object from the eyes and produce a sense of depth. This is called binocular vision.

　　However, those who suffer from stubborn rightist tendencies always like to listen with one ear and see with one eye. Therefore, they cannot distinguish where the sound comes from and cannot see the entity and depth of things clearly.

    耳目篇
    朱相远
    人的耳目，何以为双？原是为了更好的认识客观世界。
    声音传来，到达左右耳之先后、响度并非雷同，大脑便依此而辨别出声音来至何方？这叫双耳效应。
    两目视物，角度不同，引起之视觉也即存异，这样就能判断出物体各部离眼之远近，产生立体感，这叫双眼视觉。
    然而，患有右倾顽症者，总爱以单耳听音，独目视物，因此也就辨不出音从何来，看不清事物的实体、深度。
