Zhang Fei's Loyalty and Liu Feng's Treachery
    ——On the Yunnan Opera "Drumming Liu Feng"
    Lin Hanbiao

    The Yunnan Opera "Drumming Liu Feng" tells the story of Zhang Fei punishing the traitor Liu Feng. When Guan Yu was trapped in Maicheng, Liu Feng remained inactive, leading to Guan Yu's death in battle. Upon hearing the news, Zhang Fei was heartbroken. Realizing that Liu Feng intended to rebel, he decided to lead troops to Shangyong to avenge his brother and severely punish the traitor Liu Feng. Liu Feng had 200,000 soldiers, while Zhang Fei only had 3,000. Could Zhang Fei subdue Liu Feng by going to Shangyong? How could Zhang Fei subdue Liu Feng? This is the sharp conflict initially presented in the short play "Drumming Liu Feng."

    The Zhang Fei in this play does not defeat Liu Feng with force, but with wisdom and courage, making his character even more endearing! Before Zhang Fei sent out his troops, Liao Hua warned him to be careful because Liu Feng's strength was vastly superior to his own. Zhang Fei devised a plan to assassinate Liu Feng when he came out of the city to welcome him. Liao Hua said, "I'm afraid there might be mistakes in the rush!" Zhang Fei replied, "If there are mistakes, we'll just do it again!" This characteristic language highlights Zhang Fei's courage, resourcefulness, straightforwardness, and endearing personality!

    Liu Feng is a despicable individualistic ambitious man, and the play's depiction of him is quite profound! Liu Feng is both insidious and cowardly. He has long harbored rebellious intentions and wants to become emperor, but he is also foolish and incompetent. Naturally, although this kind of person is extremely foolish, his military strength is strong and should not be underestimated. He clearly knew that Guan Yu's death led to Zhang Fei's arrival and anticipated Zhang Fei's intention to seek revenge, so he devised a plan to kill Zhang Fei. However, after Zhang Fei arrived, he didn't have a chance to act. Due to his ambition and greed, Zhang Fei discerned his "rebellious bone." Zhang Fei took advantage of this traitor and ambitious man's weakness, falsely claiming to help him rebel. Thus, Liu Feng, in a state of elated self-importance, willingly allowed Zhang Fei to put him in a drum, preparing to assassinate Liu Bei. Just as this individualistic ambitious man was sound asleep in the drum, dreaming of becoming emperor, he, along with the large bass drum, was crushed at Scorpion Ridge!

    The script is well-organized, with lively language, sharp conflicts, and step-by-step development. The characters' personalities are peeled away layer by layer in the midst of conflict. The performance art in this play is also very exquisite. Comrade Qi Shaobin, who played Niu Gao in the Yunnan Opera "Niu Gao Tears Up the Imperial Edict" and won great acclaim, played Zhang Fei, successfully creating the image of a loyal, unwavering, fearless, resourceful, brave, and hateful old Zhang Fei in the face of national crisis. Comrade Qiu Yunxun, a young actor who played Liu Feng, was also very successful.

    Qiu Yunxun's creation of Liu Feng, this traitor and ambitious man, is truly penetrating! Liu Feng's appearance makes a very deep impression. He is arrogant, his aura is high, his prestige is great, but upon closer inspection, his white nose is flanked by a pair of beady eyes, and his head is filled with sneaky schemes. Upon hearing of Zhang Fei's arrival, Liu Feng was terrified. He jumped up from his chair, constantly trembling; however, with a blink of his beady eyes, he immediately devised a plan to harm others. After all, he has a guilty conscience. Although he is insidious and ruthless, and although he relies on 200,000 soldiers and seems brave and extraordinary, he even trembles when he walks, his feet are soft, and he almost can't even get on his horse. Through exaggerated movements, Qiu Yunxun outlines Liu Feng's dirty soul in just a few strokes!

    Outside the city, because Liu Feng was prepared, Zhang Fei failed to assassinate him. But Zhang Fei's power had already subdued Liu Feng! Qiu Yunxun's performance here is like a cunning fox. Zhang Fei laughed several times, and he laughed along, his laughter was so forced, so insidious, so cowardly. However, he was very sensitive to Zhang Fei's words. He sat aside, observing his expression and sensing his mood, his beady eyes constantly blinking, his face full of murderous intent; however, for a moment, he couldn't help but call him Third Uncle and ask about Liu Bei and Guan Yu. When this traitor asked about Guan Yu, he actually already knew that Guan Yu was dead, and he also expected that Zhang Fei might turn his face because of this question, so his expression was particularly nervous and particularly vicious. He gritted his teeth, lowered his head slightly, and shamelessly asked, "Is Second Uncle well?" Sure enough, as soon as Zhang Fei heard this, he immediately flew into a rage, dragging him, which frightened him. At this time, Zhang Fei wanted to get angry, but he held back, suppressing his painful and angry mood, and told Liu Feng that Guan Yu was dead. This traitor then put saliva under his eyelids to pretend to cry, while secretly watching Zhang Fei's movements. Qiu Yunxun's performance in this play deeply shows the ugliness in Liu Feng's heart.

    When Zhang Fei discerned Liu Feng's intention to rebel and falsely said he would help him rebel, Qiu Yunxun portrayed the psychological state of this ambitious man very well! Zhang Fei told him that it was most suitable for him to be emperor, so he was ecstatic, and his panic had long been thrown to the winds. He shook his head and basked in the dream of being emperor. He thought Zhang Fei really wanted to help him rebel, so he told Zhang Fei his thoughts without reservation: "I have long wanted to be emperor!" With this, Zhang Fei had a fit of anger. Zhang Fei roared and pushed him down. But Zhang Fei immediately realized the situation at the time and quickly said, "Uncle was happy for a moment, you are too timid." Liu Feng's mind was extremely hot, he believed it, covered his sore waist, stood up, with a face full of spring breeze, he didn't even want his sword, and danced with his hands. At this time, there were only the two words emperor in his heart, and he forgot everything else! Qiu Yunxun's performance is both exaggerated and reasonable, detailed and profound, with clear layers, truly possessing both spirit and form, and his skills are perfect.

    Liu Feng was finally crushed to pieces in the personalistic dream. We can't help but rejoice at Zhang Fei's loyalty and resourcefulness, and we are even more delighted by the ending of Liu Feng, this individualistic ambitious man! Excellent traditional operas, including short plays like "Drumming Liu Feng," have profound significance. Thank you to the comrades of the Yunnan Opera Troupe for performing such excellent traditional short plays for us!

    张飞的忠心和刘封的反骨
    ——谈滇剧《鼓滚刘封》
    林涵表
    滇剧《鼓滚刘封》写的是张飞惩戒叛徒刘封的故事。关羽在麦城被困，刘封按兵不动，关羽战死。消息传来，张飞痛心疾首，察知刘封有反叛之意，便决定带兵去上庸，报兄长之仇，并严惩刘封这个叛徒。刘封有二十万人马，而张飞只有三千，张飞去上庸，是否能制服刘封？张飞怎样能制服刘封？这就是《鼓滚刘封》这出短剧一开始便提出来的尖锐的矛盾冲突。
    这出戏里的张飞，不是以武力胜刘封，而是以智勇胜刘封，他的性格更觉可爱！张飞发兵之前，廖化警告他要当心，因为刘封与他的兵力相当悬殊。张飞定出趁刘封出城迎接之时把刘封刺死之计，廖化说：“犹恐忙中有错呀！”张飞答道：“错了吗重另来嘛！”这一句性格化的语言，点出了张飞有勇有谋及直率可爱的性格！
    刘封，是一个卑鄙的个人主义野心家，剧本对他的描写是相当深刻的！刘封既阴险恶毒，又胆小怕死。他早有反叛之心，想做皇帝，但又愚蠢无能。自然，这种人虽然极其愚蠢，但他的兵力雄厚，未可轻敌。他明明知道关羽之死导致张飞之来，料及张飞有复仇之意，所以设下计谋要杀张飞。可是，张飞来了以后，他未及下手，却由于他的野心勃勃，利令智昏，被张飞摸透他的“反骨”。张飞利用了这个叛徒和野心家的弱点，假说要助他造反，于是，刘封在得意忘形中，甘心情愿地被张飞装入鼓内，准备去刺杀刘备。正当这个个人主义野心家在鼓内呼呼入睡做其皇帝美梦之时，他连同那个大堂鼓，一同在蝎子岭下粉碎了！
    剧本整理得很好，语言生动，矛盾尖锐，一步一步向前发展，人物性格在矛盾冲突中一层一层被剥开了。这出戏的表演艺术也是非常精湛的。曾在滇剧《牛皋扯旨》中扮演过牛皋而获得盛誉的戚少斌同志，扮演张飞，成功地塑造了一个忠心耿耿、在国家危难中毫不动摇、毫不退缩、机智勇猛、嫉恶如仇的老张飞的形象。青年演员丘云荪同志扮演的刘封，也非常成功。
    丘云荪创造刘封这个叛徒和野心家的形象，真是入木三分！刘封一上场，给我们的印象就极深刻。他不可一世，气焰甚高，声威甚大，然而细看之下，他那白鼻梁两边，闪烁着的却是一双鼠目，脑袋里想的尽是鬼鬼祟祟的勾当。一闻张飞到来，刘封吓破了胆，他从椅子上蹦起来，不断发抖；可是，他那双鼠目一眨，立刻设下害人之计。然而，毕竟做贼心虚，尽管他阴险狠毒，尽管他倚仗有二十万人马，貌似勇猛过人，但他却连走路都发抖，双脚发软，差一点儿连马也上不去。丘云荪通过夸张的动作，把刘封这个人的龌龊灵魂，几笔就勾划出来了！
    在城外，由于刘封早有准备，张飞刺他未成。可是张飞的威势早把刘封慑住了！丘云荪在这里的表演，活像一只狡猾的狐狸。张飞几次发笑，他也陪着笑，他是笑得那样勉强，那样阴险，那样怯懦。可是，张飞的一言一语，他却十分敏感。他坐在一旁，察言辨色，一双鼠眼不断在眨动，满脸杀气；可是，一时他又不能不口口声声称呼三叔，而且还问刘备好，问关羽好。当这个叛徒问及关羽的时候，他其实早知关羽已死，而且也料到可能因此一问，张飞就要翻脸，所以他的神情特别紧张，也特别狠毒。只见他牙根一咬，头稍一沉，毫不惭愧地问“二叔可好”。果然，张飞一听，马上暴跳如雷，把他一拖，这一下子可把他吓坏了。张飞这个时候，要发火，可是又收住了，压着沉痛怒恨的心情，告诉刘封关羽已死。这个叛徒于是一边拿吐沫点在眼皮下装哭，一边偷偷观看张飞的动静。丘云荪在这一段戏里把刘封内心的丑恶，表现得很深刻。
    当张飞窥破了刘封的反意，假说要帮助他造反的时候，丘云荪把这个野心家的心理状态，表现得十分出色！张飞告诉他，只有他做皇帝最合适，于是，他得意忘形，惊惶之意早已抛向九霄云外，摇头摆脑，陶醉于皇帝的梦境之中。他以为张飞真是要助他造反，于是把心事毫无保留告诉张飞：“我早就想做皇帝的啊！”刘封这一来，真使张飞无名火起三千丈，张飞大吼一声，把他推倒了。但张飞马上醒悟到当时的处境，连忙说：“为叔一时高兴，你太胆小了。”刘封的头脑已热到极点，他信以为真，捂着摔痛了的腰，站了起来，满面春风，连佩剑也不要了，手舞足蹈起来。他这时，心中只有皇帝两个字，其他什么都忘了！丘云荪的表演，既夸张，又合情合理，细致深刻，层次分明，真是神情俱备，功夫到家。
    刘封最后在个人主义的迷梦中粉身碎骨了，我们不禁为张飞的忠心耿耿和智勇双全而喜悦，更为刘封这个个人主义野心家的收场而大快！优秀的传统戏，包括像“鼓滚刘封”这样的短戏，它的意义是深刻的。感谢滇剧团的同志，为我们演出了这样优秀的传统短剧！
