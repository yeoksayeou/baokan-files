Title: The Shoe Repairman

　　Being an athlete is great in many ways, but there's one drawback: it costs a lot in shoes. Comrades often see me buying shoes, but rarely see me wearing a new pair for more than a few days. Any shoe on my feet, after a few basketball or soccer games, splits at the toe or heel like a wide-open mouth.

　　Whenever I finished a basketball or soccer game, carrying a pair of shoes and a sweat-soaked set of clothes, passing by the dormitory entrance, old shoe repairman Grandpa Li, who set up his stall there, would greet me with a happy smile:
　　"Comrade Xiong, back to repair shoes again!"
　　And so, I became a regular customer of Grandpa Li, and we sometimes chatted together.
　　Grandpa Li is quite an interesting old man. He's sixty-five this year, but his body is as sturdy as a pine tree. He sports a sparse, slightly upturned goatee; a high forehead with a smooth scar and several knife-like wrinkles; his face never seems to rest, sometimes looking comical and playful, sometimes very serious; his sharp eyes always look at you with a shrewd expression from above his reading glasses; and he wears a funny little skullcap with a button on top.
　　Grandpa Li loves to tell stories, mostly humorous ones. If you talk to him about the life of a shoe repairman before liberation, you've hit his sweet spot. He'd push the little cap on his head to the back of his skull, scratch his scar a few times, "hiss" as he sewed the shoe, and begin in a humorous tone: "Hey, have you ever heard a story like this?"
　　One Sunday afternoon, I went to ask him to sole my leather shoes. He greeted me from afar:
　　"Comrade Xiong, resoling shoes again."
　　"Yes," I requested, "Could you do it right away?"
　　"What's this, a date with your sweetheart?"
　　"Not at all, my future wife is still in her parents' home, wherever that may be!"
　　"Young man, don't rush. Focus on developing your ideology, seeking knowledge, and doing good work, and even a peach tree in the twelfth lunar month will blossom for you." He handed me a small stool. "Sit down, I'll sole them for you."
　　"I've heard it said that the shoes you sole, even when they're worn out, the nails won't poke through the socks?" I asked.
　　"Nowadays, comrades are all striving in the Great Leap Forward, how could poking through socks be allowed? But in the old days, they didn't just poke through socks, they'd poke a big hole, then a small hole, making it impossible to walk!" he said.
　　"Your skills are improving so quickly."
　　"It's not just the skills that are improving," he habitually pushed the little cap to the back of his head, scratched the scar on his forehead, and said, "Look at this scar!"
　　"One day before liberation, a Kuomintang officer came in a fierce manner, placed his foot in front of me, and shouted: 'Old thing, quickly polish these!' I saw he was wearing a pair of snow-white socks, and fearing they might get a little black on them, I said: 'Sir, you have to take them off to polish them properly.' The officer cursed: 'Damn, everyone else polishes them while they're wearing them, are you putting on airs? Hurry up!' So I had to carefully polish them. I polished and polished, when suddenly, a woman called out to him, and he urged me like a mad dog: 'Hurry! Hurry!' In my haste, I accidentally got a little black on his white socks. His face instantly flashed with murderous intent, and he kicked me in the head like a wolf... and that's how I got this scar."
　　At this moment, a female comrade, carrying a suitcase, breathlessly asked everyone: "Excuse me, where can I get a suitcase repaired?"
　　"I can repair it here!" the old man quickly responded.
　　It turned out that Grandpa Li had expanded his business at some point, not only repairing shoes but also repairing suitcases.
　　"When can it be fixed?"
　　"Whenever you need it, it'll be ready."
　　"How about noon tomorrow?"
　　"If you're busy, leave your address, and I can deliver it."
　　The old man took out a small notebook from the drawer of his carrying pole and handed it to the female comrade. She wrote down her address with gratitude.
　　I took the notebook and looked through it page by page, it was full of addresses left by customers.
　　The sun was setting. On the tree-lined path beside us, groups of men and women, dressed in their holiday best, walked towards the club and the cinema, singing and laughing. A pair of neatly dressed young men and women, arm in arm, walked towards the shoe stall, and the young man called out: "Dad, hurry up and go home for dinner, we left some for you in the pot, we're going to see a movie!" "You go ahead." The old man only cared about nailing the shoe, not even lifting his head.
　　"Grandpa Li, were those your son and daughter-in-law who just called? What do they do now?" I asked.
　　"They graduated from the Industrial University the year before last, and now they both work at the Academy of Sciences."
　　"You're so old, and both your son and daughter-in-law are working, you should stay at home and enjoy your life!" I said.
　　"Enjoy my life? Who says I'm not enjoying my life now?" The old man's face suddenly became serious. "Do you think only people like 'Emperor Yang of Sui touring the South, sitting on a dragon boat pulled by commoners' are enjoying life? A person who loves their profession until the day they die, that's what enjoying life is. Alright, put them on and go see your movie, the girl is waiting for you!" Instantly, the serious expression on his face became playful again.
　　I took the shoes, paid the money, and after parting ways, I saw him carrying the shoe pole, not heading home, so I asked: "Grandpa Li, it's so late, aren't you going home for dinner?"
　　"I can eat every day, what's the rush? I have to deliver these repaired shoes to their owners." He didn't even turn his head, and walked straight ahead carrying the shoe pole.

### 补鞋老人

    补鞋老人
    熊华湘
    当运动员啥都好，就有一宗：费鞋。同志们老是看到我买鞋，却很少看见我穿几天新鞋。啥鞋到我的脚上，“蹬蹬”几场篮球或足球，鞋头或后跟就跟嘴巴似的裂得老大。
    每逢打完一场篮球或足球以后，我提着一双鞋，抱着一身被汗水湿透的衣服，打宿舍门前经过的时候，把补鞋摊摆在大门口的老补鞋匠李大爷面上带着乐滋滋的笑貌，对我说道：
    “熊同志，又补鞋啦！”
    这样，我就成了李大爷的老主顾了，因而我们有时候也在一块儿瞎扯扯。
    李大爷是个挺有风趣的老头儿，今年六十五岁，但他的身体却结实得像棵松树。他蓄着一撮稀稀疏疏的有点往上翘的山羊胡子；前额高高的，上面有一块光溜溜的伤疤和几道刀刻似的皱纹；一张脸从来不肯安静一下，一会儿看上去又滑稽又调皮，一会儿又变得十分严肃；他那对敏锐的眼睛总是带着一副精明的神情从老花眼镜上面瞅着你；他的头上戴着一顶挺逗笑儿的小便帽，帽顶上钉着一个钮扣。
    李大爷挺爱讲故事，大多数是些幽默的故事。要是你跟他谈起解放前补鞋匠的生活来，这就正对他的劲儿。他把头上的小帽往后脑壳一推，搔了几搔他那块伤疤，“咝咝”的纳着鞋，风趣地开腔道：“喂，你从前听过像这样的故事吗？”
    一个星期天的下午，我去请他掌皮鞋。他老远就迎接我道：
    “熊同志，又掌鞋了。”
    “嗯，”我要求道：“能不能立刻替我掌一下？”
    “怎么，有爱人的约会吗？”
    “哪里，对象还不知道在哪家丈人家呢！”
    “年轻轻的，莫慌着，一心锻炼好思想，求好学问，做好工作，腊月的桃树都会给你开花的。”他顺手递过来一张小板凳，“坐下吧，我就为你掌。”
    “听人家宣传，您掌的鞋，穿破了，钉子都不扎袜子？”我问。
    “现在同志们都在大跃进，扎袜子能成？可是在从前，不仅扎袜子，还扎得你的脚大一个窟窿，小一个窟窿，行走不得呢！”他说。
    “您的手艺进步真快呵。”
    “不是手艺进步快，”他习惯地把小帽往后脑壳一推，搔了搔额头上那块伤疤，说，“看，这块伤疤！”
    “解放前有一天，一个宪兵官老爷气势汹汹地跑来，把脚朝我前面一摆，?喝道：‘老东西，快给擦擦！’我看他穿着一双雪白的袜子、唯恐粘上一点黑的，说：‘老爷，您擦皮鞋得脱下才成呵。’宪兵官老爷破口道：他妈的，人家都是穿着擦，你还拿架子，快！于是我只好小心翼翼地擦着。擦呀擦呀，突然之间，一个女人在那边叫他，那家伙跟疯狗似地狂催道：‘快！快！’我一急，不小心给他白袜子上粘了一点黑的。那家伙顿时脸上闪着杀气，跟狼似地朝我的头上几脚……后来就留下了这块伤疤。”
    这时，一个女同志提着一个皮箱，气喘吁吁地逢人便打听：“同志，那儿有修补皮箱的？”
    “我这儿能修补！”老人急忙应声。
    原来，李大爷不知从什么时候开始扩大了业务，不仅补鞋，而且还修补皮箱了。
    “啥时候能修好？”
    “你啥时候要就啥时候有。”
    “明天中午行不行？”
    “你要是没工夫，把地址留下，我可以送去。”
    老大爷从担子抽屉里拿出一个小本子递给那个女同志。她带着感激的心情写下了自己的地址。
    我拿过小本子，一页一页地看着，里面全是顾客留下的地址。
    太阳落山了。在我们旁边的林荫道上，成群的男男女女穿着假日的盛装，带着歌声和笑声，向俱乐部、电影院走去。一对衣着整洁的青年男女，手挽着手，肩并肩地向鞋担子走来，那男青年叫道：“爸爸，您快回去吃饭吧，饭给您留在锅里了，我们去看电影啦！”“你们去吧。”老人只顾钉鞋，连头都没抬。
    “李大爷，刚才叫的是您的儿子和媳妇吧，现在干啥工作？”我问。
    “他们前年在工业大学毕业，现在都在科学院工作。”
    “您这么大年纪，儿媳俩也都参加了工作，您应该呆在家享享福罗！”我说。
    “享福？谁说我现在不是在享福？”老人脸上顿时变得严肃起来，“你以为只是‘隋炀帝游江南，自坐龙舟人拉纤’的人才算享福吗？一个人到死的那天止，一生热爱自己的职业，这就是在享福。好了，快穿上去看电影吧，人家姑娘在等着呢！”顿时，他脸上的严肃的表情又变得调皮起来了。
    我接过鞋，给了钱，分手后，我看他挑着鞋担子没朝家走去，便问道：“李大爷，这么晚了，您还不回家吃饭吗？”
    “饭天天吃的，忙啥，我得把这些修补好的鞋送给人家。”他头都没回，径直挑着鞋担子朝前走去了。（附图片）
