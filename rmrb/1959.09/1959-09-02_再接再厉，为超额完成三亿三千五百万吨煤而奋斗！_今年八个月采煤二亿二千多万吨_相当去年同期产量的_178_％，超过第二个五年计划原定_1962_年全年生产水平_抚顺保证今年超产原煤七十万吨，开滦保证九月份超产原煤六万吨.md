    Keep Up the Efforts, Strive to Overfulfill the Target of 335 Million Tons of Coal!
    220 Million Tons of Coal Mined in the First Eight Months of This Year
    Equivalent to 178% of the Output in the Same Period Last Year, Exceeding the Original Production Level for the Entire Year of 1962 Set by the Second Five-Year Plan
    Fushun Guarantees to Overproduce 700,000 Tons of Raw Coal This Year, Kailuan Guarantees to Overproduce 60,000 Tons of Raw Coal in September
    (Our Newspaper, Reporter Li Feng) The Chinese coal industry, based on the great leap forward of last year, has continued to leap forward this year. From January to August this year, more than 220 million tons of coal were produced, equivalent to 178% of the same period last year.
    The coal output in these eight months has already exceeded the original annual production level (190 million tons to 210 million tons) for 1962 set by China's Second Five-Year Plan. This is another great achievement following the "double happiness" of China's coal industry in 1958. The "double happiness" of China's coal industry in 1958: First, it far exceeded that of Britain (Britain's coal output in 1958 was about 220 million tons), and second, it overfulfilled the production level originally set for 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan four years ahead of schedule. This year's glorious achievements in the Great Leap Forward are even more gratifying.
    The achievements of China's coal industry in the Great Leap Forward are unprecedented. During the First Five-Year Plan, the five-year coal output increased by a total of 63.51 million tons, with an average annual growth rate of 14.5%. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the development of China's coal industry created a new era of high-speed growth, with a total increase of 140 million tons for the whole year, equivalent to more than twice the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan. This year, the increase in coal production in the first eight months compared with the same period last year also exceeded the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan. Imperialists say that China's industrial Great Leap Forward in 1958 was a mess, and that this year is a "great retreat," etc., which are nothing but lies that distort the truth.
    According to the reporter from the Ministry of Coal Industry, the current situation in China's coal industry is the best since the beginning of this year. Under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, coal mines across the country have unswervingly carried out a mass movement for large-scale coal production increases, promptly opposed right-leaning and slackening sentiments, and workers are full of confidence and energy. The supply of materials and equipment for coal mines has greatly increased compared to before, and the national reserves of pit props have increased to a quantity sufficient for fifty days of use. The existing equipment capacity has been more fully utilized than in the first half of this year, and more than 10,000 sets of damaged coal mining, tunneling, and transportation equipment were repaired in the third quarter. The repair of this equipment has greatly increased the production capacity of the coal industry. In terms of tunneling work, since July, the national tunneling footage has increased month by month, with an increase of 3% in July compared with June, and an increase of 6% in August compared with July. The imbalance between mining and tunneling that had occurred in some coal mines has been improved, and the recoverable period of coal in the vast majority of coal mines has increased. Among the 42 key mining bureaus across the country, 73% of the coal mines have a recoverable period of coal of more than four months, and the remaining mines have also reached three to four months. Due to the strengthening of tunneling work, the coal industry has a huge reserve force for production. At present, there are more than 250 developed working faces, and more than 100 will be put into production one after another in September and October. Among the coal mines under construction across the country, dozens of large mine shafts will also be put into production successively before the end of the year, joining the leaping ranks of coal production. All of this provides favorable conditions for fulfilling and overfulfilling this year's national plan.
    At present, coal mine workers across the country are enthusiastically responding to the combat call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with a continuing leap forward attitude, working hard in September and October, striving for greater coal production increases, and fighting heroically to fulfill and overfulfill the plan to produce 335 million tons of coal this year.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 1st) More than 1,500 advanced producers, worker representatives, and cadres from coal mines in Fushun, the coal capital, held a swearing-in and competition meeting on August 29, determined to use practical actions to respond to and implement the great call put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. At the meeting, Liu Ming, Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, on behalf of 90,000 miners in the entire mining area, announced: This year, all employees of the Fushun mining area are determined to increase coal production by 700,000 tons for the country on the basis of ensuring the completion of the national plan of 17.3 million tons of coal per year.
    Subsequently, representatives from various coal mines, mining areas, and mining teams set up battle platforms at the meeting, with mine competing against mine, area against area, and team against team, launching a competition challenge. The coal mining team where Pang Guanxiang, a national advanced producer, is located—Class 1, District 6 of the Laohutai Mine—after a heated discussion, unanimously proposed to work hard in the key month of September and raise the high-yield red flag: to create the highest record of producing 37,000 tons of coal per month on an 80-meter-long coal mining face. Jia Lianfu, a red flag bearer of Liaoning Province and Fushun City and a driver of electric shovel No. 5 in the Xilutian Mine, proposed to further promote the advanced experience of layered mining and selective loading, ensure the completion of the national plan one month ahead of schedule, and use this as a condition to challenge all coal mining electric shovel drivers in the mine. According to Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 1st, Fushun Coal Mine completed the national production plan for August one day ahead of schedule, and coal production increased by 7.4% compared with July.
    Since August, the production level of Fushun Coal Mine has been higher in each ten-day period. Taking the first ten days of August as 100, the middle ten days increased to 119.1, and the last ten days increased to 145. After the release of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the masses was even more encouraged. From the 26th to the 30th, the average daily production level of raw coal reached more than 64,500 tons, which was more than 13,500 tons per day more than the previous five days.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 1st) The workers of Kailuan Coal Mine overfulfilled the August plan for raw coal production and tunneling footage, and are determined to work hard in September to guarantee overproduction of 60,000 tons of raw coal to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    At present, leading cadres and technical personnel from various mines, together with the workers, are carrying out a mass movement to revise plans and find measures. Within a few days, the workers of each mine have put forward thousands of rationalization proposals targeting the key issues in current production. In addition, from the General Management Office to various mines, advanced experience promotion offices have been established to summarize the effective advanced experiences since August and formulate promotion measures to make them blossom everywhere. The workers in the repair departments are going all out to repair damaged equipment, ensuring that the miners have enough sophisticated weapons.

    再接再厉，为超额完成三亿三千五百万吨煤而奋斗！
    今年八个月采煤二亿二千多万吨
    相当去年同期产量的178％，超过第二个五年计划原定1962年全年生产水平
    抚顺保证今年超产原煤七十万吨，开滦保证九月份超产原煤六万吨
    本报讯　记者李峰报道：我国煤炭工业在去年大跃进的基础上，今年又继续跃进。今年1至8月共产煤二亿二千多万吨，相当于去年同期的178％。
    这8个月的煤产量已经超过了我国第二个五年计划原定1962年煤产量（一亿九千万吨到二亿一千万吨）的全年生产水平。这是继1958年我国煤炭工业“双喜临门”之后的又一大喜。我国煤炭工业1958年的“双喜”：一是远远地超过了英国（1958年英国煤产量是二亿二千万吨左右），二是提前四年超额完成了第二个五年计划原定在1962年的生产水平。今年大跃进的辉煌成就，更是喜上加喜了。
    我国煤炭工业大跃进的成就是史无前例的，在第一个五年计划期间五年的煤产量共增长了六千三百五十一万吨，平均每年的增长速度是14.5％。1958年大跃进中，我国煤炭工业的发展又开创了高速度增长的新纪元，全年共增长一亿四千万吨，等于第一个五年计划期间五年增长总量的两倍多。今年我国前八个月比去年同期增长的煤产量也超过了第一个五年计划期间增长的总量。帝国主义说我国1958年工业大跃进搞糟了，说今年是“大跃退”等等，只不过是颠倒黑白的弥天大谎。
    据记者从煤炭工业部获悉，目前我国煤炭工业出现了今年以来最好的形势。全国煤矿在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，坚定不移地开展煤炭大面积丰产的群众运动，及时反对了右倾松劲情绪，职工们信心百倍，干劲十足。煤矿用的材料设备的供应量比以前已大大增加，全国储备的坑木已增加到足够用五十天的数量。现有的设备能力已比今年上半年得到了更充分的利用，第三季度修复了用坏待修的一万多台采煤、掘进、运输等设备。这些设备的修复，大大增加了煤炭工业的生产能力。在掘进工作方面，从7月份以来，全国掘进进尺一月高过一月，7月比6月增长3％，8月又比7月增长6％。某些煤矿曾经发生的采掘失调的情况已有改善，绝大多数煤矿的获得煤量可采期都有所增加。全国四十二个重点矿务局中，有73％的煤矿的获得煤量可采期达到了四个月以上，其余的矿也都达到了三、四个月。由于掘进工作的加强，煤炭工业生产有了巨大的后备力量。现在，全国已开拓好的工作面有二百五十个以上，9、10月将有一百多个陆续投入生产。全国正在建设的煤矿中，有数十对大矿井也将在年底以前陆续投入生产，加入夺煤大军的跃进行列。所有这一切，都是完成和超额完成今年国家计划的有利条件。
    现在，全国煤矿职工，正热烈响应中共八届八中全会的战斗号召，以继续跃进的姿态，大干9、10月，争取煤炭更大的丰产，为完成和超额完成今年产煤三亿三千五百万吨的计划而英勇奋战。
    据新华社抚顺1日电　煤都抚顺各煤矿的先进生产者、职工代表和干部一千五百多人8月29日举行了誓师比武大会，决心用实际行动来响应和贯彻党的八届八中全会所提出的伟大号召。会上，抚顺矿务局局长刘鸣代表全矿区九万名矿工宣布：今年抚顺矿区全体职工决心在确保完成年产一千七百三十万吨煤的国家计划基础上，再为国家增产七十万吨煤炭。
    接着，各个煤矿、采煤区、采煤班组的代表，在会上大摆擂台，矿对矿、区对区、班对班，展开比武挑战。全国先进生产者庞观祥所在的采煤班——老虎台矿六区一班，经过热烈的讨论，一致提出要大干9月关键月，竖高产红旗：在八十米长的采煤工作面上创造月产三万七千吨煤的最高纪录。辽宁省和抚顺市的红旗手、西露天矿采煤五号电铲司机贾连富提出，要进一步推广分层采煤、挑选装车的先进经验，保证提前一个月完成国家计划，并且以此为条件，向全矿采煤电铲司机提出挑战。据新华社抚顺1日电　抚顺煤矿提前一天完成了8月份国家生产计划，煤炭产量比7月份增长7.4％。
    8月份以来，抚顺煤矿生产水平一旬高过一旬。以8月上旬作为一百，中旬提高到一百一十九点一，下旬提高到一百四十五。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布之后，更加鼓舞了群众干劲，26日到30日五天的原煤日产水平，平均达到六万四千五百多吨，比前五天每天多产一万三千五百多吨。
    据新华社唐山1日电　开滦煤矿职工，超额完成了8月份原煤生产和掘进进尺计划，并且决心大干特干9月份，保证超产原煤六万吨，迎接国庆十周年。
    目前，各矿领导干部、技术人员同工人一起，正在开展一个修订计划、找措施的群众性运动。几天之内，各矿职工都针对当前生产的关键问题，提出了数以千计的合理化建议。此外，从总管理处到各矿，还成立了先进经验推广办公室，总结8月份以来行之有效的先进经验，拟定推广措施，使之遍地开花。机修部门的职工，正在全力以赴地抢修损坏的设备，保证矿工们有足够的精良武器。
