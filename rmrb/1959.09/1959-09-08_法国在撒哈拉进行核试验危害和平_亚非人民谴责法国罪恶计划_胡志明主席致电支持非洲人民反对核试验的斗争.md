(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The French authorities' sinister plan to forcibly conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert region of North Africa has been met with increasingly strong opposition and condemnation from public opinion around the world, especially from the African people.

Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram to the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council on September 3, protesting against France's preparation to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert.

The telegram stated that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the African people's struggle to force the French government to abandon atomic weapons tests in the Sahara Desert and to respect the African people's right to live in safety and world peace.

In the telegram, President Ho Chi Minh wished success to the conference against French nuclear tests to be held in Cairo on the 7th.

On September 5, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee issued a joint statement in response to the "Day of Struggle Against French Atomic Weapons Testing in the Sahara" proposed by the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council. The statement said that the two organizations firmly oppose France's plan to test atomic bombs and demand that the French government abandon this plan.

The statement warmly welcomed the recent Soviet statement that if Western countries, like the Soviet Union, do not test nuclear weapons, then the Soviet Union will not resume testing such weapons. It called on Western countries to sign an agreement with the Soviet Union to stop testing nuclear weapons.

The Czechoslovakian "Red Rights Daily" strongly condemned France's plan to conduct atomic tests, demanding that no atomic bombs be detonated over the Sahara. It emphasized that Africa belongs and will always belong to Africans, whether today or in the future; France has no reason to conduct deadly tests on African soil.

The Women's International Democratic Federation sent a telegram to the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council in Cairo, announcing its full support for its call to hold a "Day of Struggle Against French Nuclear Testing in the Sahara" on September 7.

The African people believe that the French authorities' actions are not only a deliberate attempt to obstruct the easing of the international situation, but also an attempt to blackmail and threaten African countries. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party recently issued a statement pointing out that France's nuclear tests are intended to undermine the atmosphere of easing international tensions and to blackmail and threaten African countries in order to continue to enslave them politically and economically.

At a meeting held in Bamako on the evening of September 2, the West African Sudanese Peace Movement Committee of French Sudan decided to convene a mass rally on the 6th to protest against France's planned nuclear tests in the Sahara.

The ruling Neo Destour Party of Tunisia and the Tunisian General Labour Union recently passed a resolution protesting against France's atomic bomb tests in the Sahara Desert.

The Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Committee wrote to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council in Cairo, expressing the Indonesian people's support for the worldwide protest against France's nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara.

Sirajuddin Abbas, Vice-Chairman of the Indonesian Asian-African Solidarity Committee, said in a letter to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council on the 5th that the Indonesian people oppose nuclear weapons tests anywhere in the world.

The General Union of Students of the Republic of Iraq expressed deep concern and strong protest against the French government's determination to conduct atomic bomb tests in the Sahara Desert. The Union expressed this opinion in identical letters to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the World Peace Council, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the Premier of the People's Republic of China, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the President of France.

Representatives of five organizations, including the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, went to the French Embassy in Japan on the 5th to protest against the French government's plan to test nuclear weapons in the Sahara Desert.

The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs said in a statement issued on the 5th against French nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara Desert that the Council will hold a rally in Tokyo on the 7th against French nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara Desert, and invited 400 people, including ambassadors and ministers from Asian and African countries to Japan, to participate.

The Japan Council of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Victims Organizations issued a statement on the 5th opposing French nuclear weapons tests in the Sahara Desert. The group also sent its statement to French President de Gaulle.

The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial on the 5th saying that various African countries are in a worldwide movement against nuclear weapons testing, which is growing ever louder. The editorial pointed out that France's test plan is a dangerous provocation to the world's peace-loving people.

According to the Italian Ansa news agency, an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 2nd that the Italian government "carefully studied the possible harmful consequences for Italian residents of nuclear weapons tests conducted in other countries not far from our country."

He said the Italian government would "pay the utmost attention" to the issue. (Attached picture)
