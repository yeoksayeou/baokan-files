    The Rifts Between France and Its Allies
    Zhang Fan
    U.S. President Eisenhower arrived in Paris on September 2nd after leaving London for a visit. This is the last and most difficult leg of Eisenhower's tour of Western Europe. Even before he arrived in France, the contradictions between France and the United States, as well as between France and other Western European countries, had already become a widely discussed topic in Western newspapers. When reporting on this public opinion, the United Press International stated that due to De Gaulle's "Great France Policy," France's relations with Britain, West Germany, Italy, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are about to reach a "crisis stage." The Paris "Le Monde" also stated that the West's "general distrust" of France is approaching "a dangerous point."
    What exactly are the contradictions between France and other countries in the Western camp? And what is the background against which they arose?
    France is the weakest economically and the most politically unstable among the major imperialist countries. In recent years, France's international status has plummeted, and its status as a major power exists in name only. After De Gaulle came to power, he tried to revive France's status as a major power and used the deceptive slogan of so-called "national revival" to win over the people and attempt to strengthen his ruling position in France.
    De Gaulle first wanted to obtain certain concessions from the United States and Britain, demanding a comprehensive strengthening of France's position within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a change to the situation where the United States or the United States and Britain monopolized everything. In September of last year, De Gaulle sent letters to Eisenhower and Macmillan, formally proposing a plan to establish a core leadership of the United States, Britain, and France. This plan required the establishment of a super political organization of the United States, Britain, and France as the decision-making body for Western countries in handling Western European affairs and even world affairs. In military terms, France demanded to share atomic secrets with the United States and Britain in order to allow France to enter the "atomic club" as soon as possible. At the same time, De Gaulle also demanded the reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's "defense," allowing French generals to hold more senior military positions in this military group, and requiring each member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to maintain direct control over its own military forces.
    These demands of France have been met with a cold reception from the United States and Britain. The United States is unwilling to let France share leadership, because this will inevitably further shake the United States' increasingly weakened "leadership position." Britain is trying to maintain the established situation of "U.S.-British core leadership" and is unwilling to let France intervene. In addition, West Germany, which is trying to seize hegemony in Western Europe, also raised a great deal of objections to France's approach of posing as the spokesperson for Western European countries. The governments of Italy, Canada, Norway, and other countries have also openly opposed the establishment of a core leadership of the United States, Britain, and France. In order to avoid a head-on conflict with De Gaulle, the United States and Britain, on the one hand, used the dissatisfaction of other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with France, using the excuse that these countries "do not like the difference between big and small countries" to politely reject the demands. At the same time, they also perfunctorily dealt with France, expressing their willingness to conduct "extensive research" on France's demands. In early December 1958, a meeting was held in Washington with the participation of U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy and the British and French ambassadors to the United States to discuss De Gaulle's proposal. The United States wanted to satisfy France's demands by establishing some form of "consultation group." However, France demanded the formal establishment of a three-country committee and expressed dissatisfaction with the United States and Britain's perfunctory approach to France's demands.
    On the issue of sharing atomic secrets, the United States and Britain also refused to satisfy France's demands. Because France still has considerable difficulties in terms of raw materials and technology for manufacturing atomic bombs, De Gaulle has repeatedly asked the United States to provide technical assistance, demanding that it enjoy the same rights as Britain in sharing atomic secrets. However, the United States, citing the restrictions of the McMahon Act passed by the U.S. Congress, only agreed to provide materials and technical information for submarine reactors, and Britain also tried to prevent France from becoming the fourth atomic power in order to maintain Britain's special status within the Atlantic Group.
    Because the United States and Britain refused to satisfy France's most pressing political and military demands, the contradictions between France and the United States and Britain gradually became apparent. De Gaulle adopted a "non-cooperative" attitude on many issues, in order to bargain with the United States and Britain. As everyone knows, France has refused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to merge the fighter forces of its member states and unify "air defense," resulting in the breakdown of negotiations between France and the United States on establishing medium-range missile bases in France. One of the purposes of France's rejection of the British "Free Trade Area" plan was also to force Britain to agree to France's plan to establish a three-country core leadership.
    De Gaulle also knows that if he wants to gain the status of a major power, France today does not have enough capital, whether politically, economically, or militarily. Therefore, he wanted to rely on the strength of West Germany to first stabilize France's economic position, and then further seize hegemony in Western Europe politically. In recent years, the mutually beneficial "cooperative" relationship between France and West Germany in political, economic, and military aspects has seen significant development. After De Gaulle and Adenauer met twice, the situation of the French-West German axis began to take shape. This alliance between France and West Germany has further surfaced and complicated the contradictions between Western European imperialist countries. Due to the opening of the "Common Market" dominated by France and West Germany and the establishment of the "Small Free Trade Area" dominated by Britain, Western Europe has now formed two competing and exclusive economic groups. A fierce trade war is unfolding between these two groups.
    However, on the other hand, it should also be seen that the alliance between France and West Germany is also temporary. Because the two countries have their own plans. France is trying to unite West Germany to counter the United States and Britain, especially to compete with Britain for leadership in Western Europe. France hopes to obtain financial assistance from West Germany to cope with its increasingly severe financial and economic difficulties. Especially after the devaluation of the franc and the limited free exchange at the end of last year, France needs to obtain West Germany's financial support in order to maintain the fragile position of the franc in the fierce currency war. France is preparing to link the franc with the mark by issuing a "heavy franc" with a value equal to the West German mark, in order to stabilize the franc with the mark. At the same time, France also intends to use West German funds and technology to develop the resources of French African colonies, strengthen France's economic strength, and stabilize France's colonial rule in Africa. Of course, France also wants to use West German funds and rocket technology to accelerate the development and manufacture of France's new-style weapons. On the West German side, it also wants to woo France to exclude Britain's position in Western Europe, and then, relying on its economic advantages within "Little Europe," establish West Germany's leadership over Western Europe, making France increasingly dependent on West Germany. Politically, West Germany hopes to gain France's support on the German question and the Berlin question. Because the Paris Agreement stipulates that West Germany shall not manufacture atomic weapons, West Germany is also trying to conduct research and manufacture of atomic weapons through cooperation with France. It can be seen that the temporary alliance between France and West Germany is based on mutual use. Hidden behind this alliance are many contradictions. In particular, the sharp contradiction between the two countries in competing for leadership in Western Europe is completely irreconcilable. The Paris "Le Monde" once said: "On the issue of leadership in the Western alliance, De Gaulle's view is that the position of the Federal Republic of Germany, due to its responsibility being limited to Europe, cannot be compared with the three major powers..."
    At present, France appears to be playing the main role in the Franco-German alliance. But in reality, the real strongman is clearly not France but West Germany, and it is West Germany, not France, that dominates the "Little Europe" group. West Germany's industrial production accounts for nearly 10% of the total industrial production in the capitalist world, while France accounts for only 5%. Taking 1957 as an example, West Germany accounted for 38% of the exports of the six "Common Market" countries, while France accounted for only 23%. In terms of financial strength, France's disadvantage is even more obvious. At the end of 1958, West Germany's gold and foreign exchange reserves reached six billion U.S. dollars, while France's were only nine hundred million U.S. dollars. The collapse of the "European Payments Union" at the end of last year further weakened France's financial position and strengthened West Germany's financial position. France is the largest debtor country in the alliance, and needs to repay 635 million U.S. dollars in debt, while West Germany is the largest creditor country, and can recover more than one billion U.S. dollars in debt, thus being able to take advantage of its favorable conditions of having a frequent trade surplus to provide favorable conditions for controlling France with financial assistance in the future. In addition, the franc's dependence on the mark will further increase France's economic dependence on West Germany. It can be seen that the result of De Gaulle's alliance with Adenauer will make France increasingly dependent on West Germany. The contradictions and struggles between France and Germany hidden under the Franco-German alliance will inevitably intensify.
    Another important aspect of De Gaulle's foreign policy is the attempt to reorganize the French colonial empire. To this end, the French government has adopted a policy of combining military suppression, deception, and division towards North Africa. It attempts to maintain its precarious colonial rule and resist the encroachment of the United States and Britain on French colonial interests. After De Gaulle came to power, he set aside the "mediation" of the United States and Britain, directly reached an agreement with Tunisia to implement a partial withdrawal of troops under the premise of retaining the Bizerte military base, conducted troop withdrawal negotiations with Morocco, and tried to woo Tunisia and Morocco. De Gaulle not only attempted to divide the unity of the three North African Maghreb countries, but also wanted to strike at the activities of the United States and Britain in taking advantage of the tense relations between France and Tunisia and Morocco to squeeze France out and interfere in North African affairs. While resisting the encroachment of the United States and Britain, the De Gaulle government also demanded that the United States, Britain, and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization support France's colonial policy, especially France's Algerian policy. De Gaulle hoped that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would establish an African command, including Algeria and the North African territories of the French Community, with a Frenchman as the commander. French Chief of the Defense Staff Ely once wrote an article in "Defense Review" clarifying France's so-called "Euro-African viewpoint," advocating the establishment of a "huge French axis of Paris-Algiers-Brazzaville" as the main strategic base of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These propositions reflect France's desire to use the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to suppress the African national independence movement in order to stabilize French colonial rule. De Gaulle also hoped to use the strength of West Germany to maintain its colonial status through the "Euro-African Community" (that is, the arrangement to incorporate African colonies into the scope of the six-nation "Common Market"). In November last year, the De Gaulle government announced the "Oil Law," allowing foreign oil companies to enter the Sahara on the condition that half of the profits obtained were given to the French government, attempting to allow the oil monopoly capital of the United States, Britain, West Germany, and other countries to share the oil interests of the Sahara, so that these countries would support France's Algerian policy. However, what the United States, Britain, and West Germany are concerned about is not maintaining France's colonial status, but taking advantage of France's crisis to encroach on France's colonial interests. The United States and Britain not only want to continue to infiltrate North Africa and use the "Oil Law" to seize the Sahara oil resources, but also try their best to take advantage of the new situation of the rising national independence movement in Black Africa to undermine France's position. Britain is trying to use the Guinea-Ghana Federation and the federation of some French colonies and British colonies that are being brewed to bring these countries into the British Commonwealth system and replace France's position in Black Africa. The United States also wants to allow Liberia, which is controlled by the United States, to participate in the core of the West African state alliance formed by Guinea and Ghana, in order to squeeze out Britain and France and expand the United States' power in Black Africa. West Germany also plans to conduct economic expansion in France's African colonies through the "Euro-African Community." Therefore, the struggle between France and the United States, Britain, and West Germany for colonies has also become more acute.
    In short, these demands of the De Gaulle government in foreign policy have created great contradictions between France and various countries in the Western camp, aroused great dissatisfaction among its allies, and also created France's isolated situation in the Western camp today. The Paris "Liberation" wrote recently: "After more than a year of 'seizing power alone,' General De Gaulle should now realize that his policy has reached a dead end, whether on the Algerian issue or in diplomacy." It can be seen from recent reports in the Western press that De Gaulle will still insist on his demands on sharing the leadership of the Western alliance and atomic secrets, as well as the Algerian issue, during this U.S.-French meeting. However, France today faces many difficulties in both domestic and foreign affairs, and its own strength is so weak that De Gaulle cannot possibly gain anything in this struggle.
    All these actions of De Gaulle today are entirely to serve the French monopoly capital group, and they have nothing in common with the true national interests of the French people. This approach will inevitably lead France further into difficulties and further isolate and weaken France's international position. Obviously, France's real way out is not to raise its own value with atomic bombs, nor to continue to engage in the colonial war in Algeria, but to change its current policy as the French people demand, and to do its part in the cause of easing international tensions, improving international relations, and maintaining peace.

    法国和它的盟国之间的倾轧
    张帆
    美国总统艾森豪威尔已在9月2日从伦敦到达巴黎进行访问。这是艾森豪威尔此次出巡西欧的最后一个也是最困难的一个行程。在他还没有来到法国以前，关于法国同美国以及法国同其他西欧国家之间的矛盾早已成为西方报纸的一个广泛的论题。合众国际社在报道这种舆论反映时说：由于戴高乐的“大法国政策”，法国同英国、西德、意大利和北大西洋集团国家的关系，将要达到“危机阶段”。巴黎“世界报”也说，西方对法国的“普遍不信任”，已接近于“危险点的程度”。
    法国跟西方阵营其他国家的矛盾究竟何在？它们又是在什么背景下产生的呢？
    法国是主要帝国主义国家中经济上最软弱、政治上最不稳定的国家。近几年来，法国的国际地位一落千丈，大国地位名存实亡。戴高乐上台以后，力图重振法国的大国地位，并以所谓“民族复兴”的欺骗口号笼络人心，企图加强他在法国国内的统治地位。
    戴高乐首先想取得美英的某些让步，要求全面加强法国在北大西洋集团内部的地位，改变由美国或美英两国垄断一切的局面。去年9月，戴高乐致函艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦，正式提出建立美、英、法三国核心领导的方案。这个方案要求设立一个美、英、法三国的超级政治机构，作为西方国家在处理西欧事务以至世界事务中的决策机构。在军事上，法国要求同美英分享原子秘密，以便使法国早日进入“原子俱乐部”。同时，戴高乐还要求改组北大西洋集团的“防务”，让法国将领在这个军事集团中担任更多的高级军事职务，并要求北大西洋集团各成员国对本国的军事力量保持直接控制。
    法国的这些要求遭到了美国和英国的冷遇。美国不愿让法国分享领导权，因为这势必会进一步动摇美国日益削弱的“领导地位”。英国力图保持“美英核心领导”的既定局面，不愿让法国插手。此外，正在企图攫取西欧大陆霸权的西德，对法国这种以西欧大陆国家代言人自居的作法也大兴醋波。意大利、加拿大、挪威等国政府也公开反对建立美英法核心领导。美英两国为了避免同戴高乐正面冲突，一方面利用北大西洋集团其他成员国对法国的不满，以这些国家“不喜欢大国和小国之间有所区别”为托词予以婉言拒绝。同时又对法国进行敷衍，表示愿对法国的要求进行“广泛的研究”。1958年12月初，在华盛顿举行了有美国副国务卿帮办墨菲和英、法驻美大使参加的会谈，讨论戴高乐的建议。美国想以设立某种形式上的“磋商小组”来满足法国的要求。但法国却要求正式建立一个三国委员会，而对美、英搪塞法国要求的做法表示不满。
    在分享原子秘密问题上，美、英两国也拒绝满足法国的要求。由于法国在制造原子弹的原料和技术方面还存在着相当的困难，戴高乐曾一再要求美国提供技术援助，要求在分享原子秘密方面跟英国享有同等的权利。但美国却借口美国国会所通过的麦克马洪法的限制，只同意提供潜水艇用反应堆的物资和技术情报，英国也力图阻止法国成为第四个原子国家，以便保持英国在大西洋集团内部的特殊地位。
    由于美英拒绝满足法国最迫切的政治和军事要求，法国同美英的矛盾就逐渐趋于表面化，戴高乐在许多问题上都采取了“不合作”态度，借以向美英讨价还价。大家知道，法国曾拒绝北大西洋集团司令部关于合并各成员国战斗机部队和统一“空防”的计划，造成了法美关于在法国建立中程导弹基地的谈判的破裂。而法国拒绝英国“自由贸易区”计划的目的之一，也是想借此迫使英国同意建立三国核心领导的法国方案。
    戴高乐也知道，要想争取大国地位，法国今天无论在政治上、经济上或军事上，本钱都是不够的。因此，他就想借助于西德的力量来首先稳定法国的经济地位，然后再在政治上进一步夺取西欧霸权。近年来，法国和西德在政治、经济、军事各方面的相互利用的“合作”关系有了显著的发展。戴高乐同阿登纳两度会谈以后，法国和西德轴心的局面就开始形成了。法国同西德的这种联合，使西欧帝国主义国家间的矛盾进一步表面化和复杂化了。由于以法国和西德为主的“共同市场”的开张和以英国为主的“小自由贸易区”的建立，西欧现在已形成两个相互竞争和排斥的经济集团。这两个集团之间正在展开激烈的贸易战。
    但是，另一方面也应该看到，法国和西德的联盟也是暂时的。因为它们两国都各有各的打算。法国企图联合西德来同美、英相抗衡，特别是同英国争夺对西欧大陆的领导权。法国希望从西德取得财政援助以应付日益深重的财政经济困难。特别是去年年底法郎实行贬值和有限度的自由兑换以后，法国更需要取得西德的财政支持，以便在激烈的货币战中维持脆弱的法郎的地位。法国准备以发行一种价值同西德马克相等的“重法郎”的办法，把法郎同马克联系起来，以便借马克来稳定法郎，同时，法国也企图利用西德的资金和技术来开发法属非洲殖民地的资源，加强法国的经济实力，稳定法国在非洲的殖民统治地位。当然，法国还想利用西德的资金和火箭技术以加速发展法国的新式武器的研究和制造。在西德这方面，也想以拉拢法国的办法来排挤英国在西欧的地位，然后凭借它在“小欧洲”内部的经济优势，树立西德对西欧的领导权，使法国日益依附于西德。在政治上，西德希望在德国问题和柏林问题上取得法国的支持。由于巴黎协定规定西德不得制造原子武器，西德也企图通过同法国的合作来进行原子武器的研究和制造。由此可见，法国—西德的暂时联合是建立在相互利用的基础之上的。这种联合的背后隐藏着重重的矛盾。特别是两国争夺西欧大陆领导权的尖锐矛盾，完全不可调和。巴黎“世界报”就曾说过：“在西方联盟领导问题上，戴高乐的看法是：德意志联邦共和国的地位，由于它的责任以欧洲为限，是不能同三大国相提并论的……”。
    目前，表面上法国在法德联合中扮演着主要角色。但实际上真正的强者显然不是法国而是西德，在“小欧洲”集团中占统治地位的也是西德而不是法国。西德的工业生产在整个资本主义世界工业生产中所占的比重近10％，而法国不过是5％。在“共同市场”六国的出口中，以1957年为例，西德占38％，法国只占23％。在财政实力方面，法国的劣势更加明显，1958年底西德黄金外汇储备达六十亿美元，法国仅九亿美元。去年年底“欧洲支付同盟”的瓦解进一步削弱了法国的财政地位而加强了西德的财政地位。法国是同盟中最大的债务国，需要清偿六亿三千五百万美元的债务，而西德却是最大的债权国，可以收回十亿多美元的债款，从而可以利用其经常有贸易顺差的有利条件，为今后利用财政援助控制法国提供了有利条件。此外，法郎对于马克的依附也将使法国进一步在经济上依赖西德。由此可见，戴高乐同阿登纳联合的结果，将使法国日益依附于西德。在法德联合掩盖下的法德间的矛盾和斗争必将加剧。
    戴高乐对外政策的另一重要方面，是企图重整法兰西殖民帝国。为此，法国政府对北非采取了军事镇压、欺骗和分化相结合的政策。企图借此维持岌岌可危的殖民统治，同时抗拒美、英染指法国的殖民利益。戴高乐上台后，就撇开了美英“斡旋”，直接同突尼斯达成在保留比塞大军事基地的前提下实行部分撤军的协议，同摩洛哥进行撤军谈判，并对突尼斯、摩洛哥大事拉拢。戴高乐不仅企图借此分化北非马格里布三国的团结，而且想借以打击美英利用法国同突、摩的紧张关系排挤法国和过问北非事务的活动。在抗拒美英染指的同时，戴高乐政府还要求美英及其他北大西洋集团成员国支持法国的殖民政策，特别是法国的阿尔及利亚政策。戴高乐希望北大西洋集团设立一个非洲司令部，包括阿尔及利亚和法兰西共同体的北非领地，由法国人担任司令。法国国防总参谋长埃利曾经在“国防评论”上撰文阐明法国的所谓“欧非观点”，主张建立“巴黎—阿尔及利亚—布拉柴维尔的巨大的法国轴心”作为北大西洋集团的主要战略基地。这些主张都反映了法国企图借用北大西洋集团的力量来镇压非洲民族独立运动以稳定法国殖民统治的愿望。戴高乐还希望通过“欧非共同体”（即把非洲殖民地纳入六国“共同市场”范围的安排），借用西德的力量来维持其殖民地位。去年11月戴高乐政府公布了“石油法”，允许外国石油公司在把取得利润的一半分给法国政府的条件下，进入撒哈拉，企图通过让美、英、西德等国的石油垄断资本分享撒哈拉石油利益的办法，使这些国家支持法国的阿尔及利亚政策。但是，美、英、西德所关心的并不是维护法国的殖民地位，而是乘法国之危染指法国的殖民利益。美英两国不仅想继续渗入北非，利用“石油法”攫取撒哈拉石油资源，而且竭力利用黑非洲民族独立运动高涨的新形势来挖法国的墙脚。英国企图利用几内亚—加纳联邦和酝酿中的某些法国殖民地同英国殖民地的联邦，把这些国家拉到英联邦体系中去，取代法国在黑非洲的地位。美国也想让美国控制下的利比里亚参加几内亚—加纳所组成的西非国家联盟的核心，以便排挤英法，扩张美国在黑非洲的势力。西德也打算通过“欧非共同体”在法国的非洲殖民地进行经济扩张。因此，法国同美英西德之间争夺殖民地的斗争也更加尖锐了。
    总之，戴高乐政府在对外政策上的这些要求，已经使法国同西方阵营各国之间产生了很大的矛盾，引起了它的盟国的极大不满，同时也造成了法国今天在西方阵营中的孤立处境。巴黎“解放报”在最近写道：在“独揽大权一年有余之后，戴高乐将军今天应该认识到：他的政策已陷入绝境，不管是在阿尔及利亚问题上还是在外交方面都是如此”。从西方报刊最近的报道中可以看出，戴高乐在这次美法会谈中仍将坚持他在分享西方联盟领导权和原子秘密以及阿尔及利亚问题上的要求。可是法国今天在内政外交方面都存在着重重的困难，它本身的力量又是如此软弱，戴高乐在这场搏斗中是不可能得到什么东西的。
    戴高乐今天这一切做法，完全是为法国垄断资本集团服务的，它跟法国人民真正的民族利益毫无共同之点。这种做法必然会把法国进一步引入困境，使法国的国际地位进一步陷于孤立和削弱。显然，法国的真正出路不是以原子弹来抬高自己的身价，不是继续从事在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，而是像法国人民所要求的，改变现在的政策，在缓和国际紧张局势和改善国际关系、维护和平的事业中尽自己的力量。（附图片）	原载西柏林“前进报”
