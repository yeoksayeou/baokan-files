On the eve of the great tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation, we are particularly excited that the Ballet Troupe of the Soviet State Grand Theatre has come from afar to visit and perform in our country. We warmly welcome all the comrades of the Ballet Troupe visiting China and extend our cordial brotherly greetings!

As early as 1935, when I led a troupe to visit the Soviet Union, I admired the wonderful ballet of the Grand Theatre and forged a deep friendship with the actor comrades. Our troupe performed in the Grand Theatre, and the Soviet audience understood Chinese opera very well. We heard their precise comments on Chinese opera. That artistic exchange gave us a great deal of benefit.

Speaking of Soviet ballet, people are reminded of the excellent traditional art of the Grand Theatre. It has a rich and varied repertoire. Over the past two hundred years, many outstanding performers and stage designers have emerged, and they have made great achievements in dance and stage art.

As early as the end of the eighteenth century, Russian serfs and poor people formed the first professional ballet troupe—the V. Urusov Troupe, which opened the first page in the history of the Grand Theatre. Later it became the Royal Ballet Troupe, and the content of the performances was officially determined. Those programs were only luxurious and entertaining, and the aristocratic audience particularly liked to watch foreign actors perform ballet. However, the ideological struggle of the troupe to respect artistic traditions and national styles has never stopped. The excellent actors and directors among them have always maintained close ties with advanced cultural workers and expressed enthusiastic responses to all progressive ideas. Therefore, the formation of the national style of Russian classical ballet is inseparable from the development history of the Grand Theatre Ballet. It profoundly depicts the emotions deep in the hearts of the people, and its beautiful form and superb performing skills with national characteristics have won immortal reputation. The development of Chinese Peking Opera and the bumpy road experienced by Soviet ballet have something in common. Peking Opera originally evolved from simple and plain local operas. It entered the court from the folk, and its skills were improved, but it is undeniable that it also brought feudal dross in terms of repertoire. However, it has always maintained the characteristics of traditional art.

In the Soviet era, Soviet ballet dancers had the opportunity to fully develop their talents, not only inheriting excellent traditional art, but also greatly developing it. This is the same as the return of Chinese Peking Opera to the people after liberation, and under the correct guidance of the Party, the implementation of "making the old serve the new and weeding out the old to bring forth the new."

The Ballet Troupe of the Soviet State Grand Theatre, which is visiting China this time, is large in scale and well-organized, which is rare among the troupes that the Soviet Union has sent abroad in the past. Many famous and outstanding actors in the troupe, such as Ulanova, Lepeshinskaya, Plisetskaya, and Sergeyev, are either new acquaintances or old friends of mine. Among them, Comrade Ulanova is a long-renowned and world-famous ballet dancer. I watched her "Swan Lake" for the first time when I visited the Soviet Union in 1935. Seventeen years later, in 1952, during the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month held in our country, she came to China for a visit, and I watched her wonderful performance again. She once said: "At the beginning of my dance life, technique occupied my main attention, accounting for the vast majority of my time and energy, but this kind of exercise is by no means developing towards acrobatics, but to improve technique and master more stage movements. From the continuity and natural connection of movements, like a flowing stream of transformation, with this ability, can express great emotions, dance will be generalized and full of poetry." I saw from her performance that she had fully realized her ideal. Her performance is truly doing rigidity within softness, softness within rigidity, the combination of rigidity and softness, smoothness and satisfaction, leaping lightness, and beautiful demeanor. Every time I appreciate her art, I feel like reading a good poem full of sincere emotions. In short, her superb performance has reached the state of perfection.

At the end of 1952, I went to Vienna to attend the World Peace Congress. On the way back, I passed through Moscow. Comrade Ulanova came to the station to meet us, and we also spent the New Year together. In the winter of 1957, I participated in the Chinese Labor People's Delegation to Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, and we met again. She talked to me about her experience in rehearsing "The Red Poppy Flower," which is based on a Chinese story. I once expressed my hope that she could visit China again in 1959 during the National Day of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our country. She enthusiastically replied: "I am willing to come and celebrate this festival with the Chinese people." Now, she has really come, which makes us very excited!

The Ballet Troupe of the Soviet State Grand Theatre will perform soon, and the broad masses of the capital will be very fortunate. We will have another good opportunity to observe.

Finally, I respectfully wish the Ballet Troupe of the Soviet State Grand Theatre a huge success in their visit to China! May the cause of cultural and artistic exchanges between China and the Soviet Union be increasingly consolidated and developed!

    欢迎苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团
    梅兰芳
    在建国十周年伟大节日的前夕，苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团不远万里来我国进行访问演出，使我们感到特别兴奋。我们热烈欢迎这次访华的芭蕾舞团全体同志，并致以亲切的兄弟般的敬礼！
    早在1935年我带了剧团访问苏联的时候，就欣赏了大剧院的精采的芭蕾舞，并且和演员同志们结下了深厚的友谊。我们剧团在大剧院里演过戏，苏联的观众都很懂中国戏，我们听到了他们对中国戏的精确评论。那一次的艺术交流，给了我们很大的收获。
    谈到苏联的芭蕾舞，人们就要联系到大剧院的优秀传统艺术，它拥有丰富多采的剧目，两百年来，前后出现了许多卓越的表演家和舞台设计者，他们在舞蹈和舞台造型方面都有巨大的成就。
    远在十八世纪末，俄国的农奴和贫民组成了第一个职业性的芭蕾舞团——沃·乌鲁索夫剧团，揭开了大剧院历史的第一页。后来成为皇家芭蕾舞团，并被官方决定了上演节目的内容，那些节目只是讲究豪华、专供娱乐的，同时贵族阶级观众还特别爱看外国来的演员演出的芭蕾舞。但是剧团方面，为了尊重艺术传统和民族风格而作的思想斗争，从来没有停止过，他们当中的优秀演员和导演们，总是和先进的文化工作者保持着密切的联系，对一切进步思想表示热烈的响应。所以俄国古典芭蕾舞民族风格的形成，和大剧院芭蕾舞发展的历史是分不开的。它深刻地刻划了人民心灵深处的情感，它那富有民族特色的优美形式和精湛的表演技巧，获得了不朽的声誉。中国京剧的发展和苏联芭蕾舞所经过的坎坷不平的道路，有相同之点。京剧本来是从简单朴素的地方戏变化发展而来的，它由民间进入宫廷，在技巧方面有所提高，但不可否认，在剧目方面，也带来了封建糟粕，然而它却一向保持着传统艺术的特色。
    到了苏维埃时代，苏联的芭蕾舞演员们才有了充分发展才能的机会，不但继承了优秀传统艺术，而且大大地有所发扬。这和解放后中国的京剧归还到人民的手中，在党的正确方针指导下，贯彻了推陈出新，去芜存精也是一样的。
    这次访华的苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团，规模盛大，阵容整齐，是苏联历次出国的剧团中所罕见的。剧团里许多著名的优秀演员，如乌兰诺娃、列别申斯卡娅、普利谢茨卡娅、谢尔盖耶夫等同志，有的是我的新知，有的是我的旧友，其中乌兰诺娃同志是一位久负盛誉、世界闻名的芭蕾舞演员。1935年我首次访苏，就看过她的“天鹅湖”。十七年后，1952年在我国举行的中苏友好月，她来中国访问，我又看了她的精采表演。她曾说过：“我开始舞蹈生活之初，技术占了我的主要注意力，占了我绝大部分的时间和精力，但是这种锻炼，绝不是朝着杂技的方面发展，而是要提高技术，掌握更多的舞台动作。从动作的连续性和自然的衔接，好像流水一般的转变，具备了这样能力，才能表现出伟大的感情来，舞蹈才会是概括化并富有诗意的。”我从她的表演中看出，她完全实现了自己的理想。她的表演真正是做到了刚中有柔，柔中有刚，刚柔相济，圆转如意，腾跃轻灵，仪态美妙。我每次欣赏她的艺术，都仿佛读了一篇充满着真挚感情的好诗，总之，她的精湛表演，已经达到炉火纯青，登峰造极的境界了。
    1952年末，我赴维也纳参加世界和平大会，归途经过莫斯科，乌兰诺娃同志到车站来接我们，我们还在一起欢度了新年。1957年冬间，我参加了我国劳动人民代表团到莫斯科庆祝社会主义十月革命四十周年，我们又见了面，她对我谈了排演以中国故事为题材的“红罂粟花”的经验。我曾表示希望她能在1959年我国建国十周年的国庆日子再度来华访问。她热情地回答：“我愿意来和中国人民一同庆祝这个节日。”如今，她果然来了，真使我们十分兴奋！
    苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团很快就要演出，首都广大观众的眼福实在不浅，我们又能得到一次很好的观摩机会。
    最后，我敬祝苏联国家大剧院芭蕾舞团访华演出获得巨大的成功！中苏两国文化艺术交流事业日益巩固和发展！
