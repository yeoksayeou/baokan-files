Greetings from Comrade Nozaka Sanzo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and Head of the Japanese Communist Party Delegation

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and on behalf of the progressive workers and the Japanese people who are fighting against the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people—U.S. imperialism—I extend warm congratulations to the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Our delegation of the Japanese Communist Party expresses heartfelt gratitude to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for inviting us to participate in this celebration.

For the past ten years, the traitorous and reactionary government of Japan has done everything possible to prevent representatives of the Japanese Communist Party from officially visiting China. However, the situation has now changed. We have been able to obtain passports issued by the Japanese government to participate in this celebration. We believe that this is the result of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the enormous development of the People's Republic of China, and the tenacious struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people for Japanese-Chinese friendship.

I personally spent fourteen years ago in Yan'an, where I shared weal and woe with Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, and jointly opposed the Japanese imperialist aggression against China. Whenever I compare today's China with the China of the past, I am always more immersed in infinite emotion than anyone else. I remember the life of living in cave dwellings in Yan'an, and seeing the great People's China before me and the grand occasion of celebrating its tenth anniversary today, I feel that this is a miracle. I believe that all of this should be attributed to the great Chinese people, to the correct leadership of their leader, the Chinese Communist Party, and to their indomitable efforts.

Now please allow me to read the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party.

Congratulatory Message

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, on behalf of all members of our party and on behalf of the Japanese people who are fighting for peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards, extends heartfelt and joyful congratulations to the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

The Chinese people have been engaged in anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles for more than a century, and they have been liberated under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party for ten years. Now, you are carrying out socialist construction with the momentum of moving mountains and overturning seas.

The October Socialist Revolution fundamentally changed human history. The Chinese Revolution is the largest event in world history after the October Revolution. The success of the Chinese Revolution has further consolidated the world socialist system headed by the Soviet Union.

Due to the victory of the Chinese Revolution and the subsequent achievements in socialist construction, the Chinese society, which was originally in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state, has gradually transformed into a highly developed industrial country in a very short period of time.

This miraculous reality is like lighting a bright lamp of hope for the backward nations in Asia and the world who have been groaning under imperialist rule and oppression for many years, giving them great encouragement.

The Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has led the Chinese people, learned from the lessons of the October Socialist Revolution and the construction experience of the Soviet Union, and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism while achieving revolutionary victories and construction achievements. We express our heartfelt respect for this great achievement!

New China, socialist China, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, has become a strong fortress for defending world peace, and is playing a decisive role, especially in defending peace in the Far East.

China has opposed the U.S. imperialist aggression in Korea, Vietnam, and the Taiwan Strait, resolutely smashed the imperialist conspiracy to launch a war, and made tremendous contributions to defending peace in the Far East and world peace. This has strengthened the confidence of peace-loving people all over the world and made them feel infinite joy.

Socialism is gradually overwhelming capitalism, and the forces of peace in the world are defeating the forces of war. No matter how ferocious the forces are, they can no longer resort to war. A new era for mankind is beginning. The Soviet Union's cosmic rocket reaching the moon, the Soviet government's proposal for complete disarmament, Comrade Khrushchev's historically significant speech at the United Nations, and the grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China now underway, all herald that the arrival of a new era for mankind is not far away!

Japan and China have had extremely close cultural, economic, and political ties for two thousand years. Unfortunately, the modern history of Japan is a history of imperialist aggression against China. The ruling class of militarist Japan not only brutally oppressed the Japanese people at home, but also carried out brutal aggression against China. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, went all out to fight against Japanese imperialist aggression for many years. The heroic resistance of the Chinese people played a decisive role in smashing Japanese imperialism. During this period, the progressive people of Japan fought alongside the Chinese people against the Japanese imperialist policy of aggression. The Japanese Communist Party has always supported the just struggle of the Chinese people and has always stood at the forefront of the Japanese people's struggle against imperialism and against war.

The victory of the Chinese Revolution has given tremendous encouragement and courage to the Japanese people who are struggling to get rid of the rule of U.S. imperialism and Japanese traitorous monopoly capital. At the same time, the Japanese people deeply appreciate the great support and concern that the Chinese people, who have already achieved revolutionary victory, have given to the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

Most Japanese people realize that the reactionary ruling class's oppression of the Japanese people is always closely linked to the imperialist policy of aggression. The democratic forces in Japan are determined not to allow the reactionary ruling class to implement a policy of aggression again, and not to allow them to continue to oppress the people. The democratic forces in Japan are waging a tit-for-tat struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union. The successive Japanese governments after the war have been at the beck and call of U.S. imperialism, providing Japan's land, sea, and air to the United States as military bases, allowing the United States to transport nuclear weapons into Japan, and allowing the United States to completely occupy Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, which are inseparable territories of Japan. The most reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government among the successive governments, while further submitting to the United States, is implementing a policy of reviving militarism and imperialism. Disregarding the Japanese people's desire to adopt a neutral policy, they are revising the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in order to openly establish a Japan-U.S. military alliance that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union. The Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision and further demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, combined with the mass opposition to the militarization of education, the strengthening of exploitation through capitalist enterprise rationalization, and the opposition to unemployment and low wages, is developing into a nationwide unified action centered on the working class. Joint struggle organizations of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic forces have been established in almost all prefectures and most towns and villages in Japan. Our party stands at the forefront of this large-scale people's struggle and strives to strengthen the people's unity. The Japanese people are steadfastly struggling to smash the common conspiracy of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries aimed at strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance system and making Japan more submissive to the United States.

Because U.S. imperialism has adopted an anti-communist and anti-China policy, and because the Japanese ruling class, which cooperates with it, is implementing an anti-national and anti-people policy, diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not been restored until today, fourteen years after the war. Without the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the signing of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, peace in the Far East is not guaranteed. Our party guarantees to work with all Japanese people who desire peace, independence, and neutrality to strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and for the development of exchanges and friendship between the people of Japan and China.

In the joint statement issued by our party's delegation during its visit to your country in March this year together with the Chinese Communist Party delegation, it was confirmed that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of Asia and the world, and pointed out the important issues and common cause facing the people of Japan and China. Our party is working hard to concretely implement the spirit of this joint statement, and will continue to make greater efforts in the future.

Our party and the Japanese people strongly demand the early restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations.

Our party and the Japanese people are confident that the Chinese people, who are celebrating the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, will achieve even greater success and great achievements in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong.

Long live the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is carrying out socialist construction with the force of moving mountains and overturning seas!

Long live the Chinese people who have achieved revolutionary victory and are achieving great achievements in socialist construction!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party that led the Chinese revolution to victory and leads socialist construction!

Long live the friendship and unity between the people of Japan and China!

Long live the unity of the people of the world striving for peace, national liberation, and socialism!

    日本共产党中央委员会主席、日本共产党代表团团长
    野坂参三同志的贺词
    我代表日本共产党中央委员会，并代表正在同日中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义进行斗争的日本进步工人和日本人民，向中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    我们日本共产党代表团对于中国共产党中央委员会邀请我们参加这个庆祝大会，表示衷心的感谢。
    日本的卖国的反动政府，过去十年来一直百般阻挠日本共产党的代表正式访问中国。但是，现在情况发生了变化。我们已经能够拿到日本政府发给的护照参加这个庆祝大会了。我们相信，这是东风压倒西风的结果，也是中华人民共和国获得巨大发展和日本的广大人民为争取日中友好进行顽强斗争的结果。
    我个人十四年前在延安，曾经跟毛泽东主席和其他中国共产党的领导人一起，同过甘苦，共过患难，并且共同反对过日本帝国主义对中国的侵略。每当把今天的中国同过去的中国加以比较的时候，我总是比任何人都更加沉缅在无限的感慨中。我想起当年在延安住窑洞的生活，又看到眼前的伟大的人民中国和今天庆祝它的建国十周年的盛况，感到这是一种奇迹。我认为，这一切都应当归功于伟大的中国人民，归功于他们的领导者中国共产党的正确领导，归功于他们的不屈不挠的努力。
    现在请允许我宣读日本共产党中央委员会的贺词。
                贺　词
    日本共产党中央委员会代表我党全体党员，并代表为了争取和平、独立、民主以及提高生活水平而斗争的日本人民，向中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝大会致以衷心喜悦的祝贺！
    中国人民进行了一个多世纪的反帝反封建的斗争，在伟大的中国共产党的领导下得到解放也有十年了。现在，你们正以移山倒海的气势进行社会主义建设。
    十月社会主义革命使人类历史发生了根本性的转变。中国革命是继十月革命以后世界历史上最大的事件。中国革命的成功，使以苏联为首的世界社会主义体系更加巩固了。
    由于中国革命的胜利和随之而取得的社会主义建设上的成就，使原处于半封建半殖民地状态的中国社会，在极短的期间内，便逐渐转变为高度发展的工业国家。
    这个奇迹般的现实，对于长年累月在帝国主义统治和压迫下呻吟的亚洲和全世界的落后民族来说，犹如点起了一盏明亮的希望之灯，给予了他们极大的鼓舞。
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导着中国人民，学习了十月社会主义革命的教训和苏联的建设经验，一面创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，一面取得了革命的胜利和建设上的成就。对于这种丰功伟绩，我们表示由衷的敬意！
    新中国，社会主义的中国，和苏联以及其他社会主义国家一起，成了保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒，尤其在保卫远东和平方面正起着决定性的作用。
    中国反对了美帝国主义在朝鲜、越南以及台湾海峡的侵略，坚决粉碎了帝国主义发动战争的阴谋，在保卫远东和平和世界和平方面作出了巨大的贡献。这使期望和平的全世界人民增强了信心，并感觉到无限的喜悦。
    社会主义逐渐压倒了资本主义，世界的和平力量正战胜着战争的力量。无论怎样凶恶的势力，再也不能诉诸于战争了。人类的新的时代正在开始。苏联的宇宙火箭到达月球，苏联政府提出的全面裁军的建议，赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国发表的具有历史意义的演说，现在正举行的盛大的中华人民共和国建国十周年庆祝大会，都预示着人类的新的时代的来临已经为期不远了！
    日本和中国在文化、经济和政治上的极为紧密的联系已经有两千年的历史。不幸得很，日本的近代史就是一部对于中国进行帝国主义侵略的历史。军国主义日本的统治阶层，一面在国内野蛮地压迫日本人民，一面对中国进行了残暴的侵略。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，全力以赴地进行了多年的反对日本帝国主义侵略的斗争。中国人民的英勇抗战，对于粉碎日本帝国主义起了决定性的作用。在这个时期，日本的进步人民和中国人民一起进行了反对日本帝国主义的侵略政策的斗争。日本共产党一贯支持中国人民的正义斗争，一直站在日本人民反对帝国主义、反对战争的斗争的最前列。
    中国革命的胜利，给予了正在为摆脱美帝国主义和日本卖国垄断资本的统治而进行斗争的日本人民以莫大的鼓舞和勇气。同时，日本人民深深感谢已经取得革命胜利的中国人民对日本人民争取和平、独立、民主和中立的一切斗争所给予的大力支持和关怀。
    大多数日本人民都认识到，反动统治阶层对于日本人民的压迫是经常同帝国主义的侵略政策紧密地结合在一起的。日本的民主力量决心坚决不许反动统治阶层再实行侵略政策，不许他们继续压迫人民。日本的民主力量正在向岸信介政府敌视中国和苏联的政策进行针锋相对的斗争。战后的历届日本政府都听命于美帝国主义，把日本的陆海空提供给美国作军事基地，让美国把核武器运进日本，容许美国完全占领日本的不可分割的领土冲绳和小笠原群岛。在历届政府中最反动的岸信介政府，一面进一步屈从于美国，一面实行复活军国主义和帝国主义的政策。他们不顾日本人民要求采取中立政策的愿望，正在修改日美安全条约，以便公开建立跟中国和苏联为敌的日美军事同盟。而日本人民阻止修改并进而要求废除日美安全条约的斗争，同人民群众反对教育军国主义化、反对通过资本主义的企业合理化来加强剥削、反对失业和低工资等广泛的要求结合在一起，正发展成为以工人阶级为中心的全国性的统一行动。在日本几乎所有的府县以及大多数城镇和村庄都建立了共产党、社会党和其他民主力量的联合斗争组织。我们党站在这个大规模的人民斗争的最前列，为加强人民的团结和统一而奋斗。日本人民为了粉碎日美反动派共同策划的旨在加强日美军事同盟体制和使日本更加屈从美国的阴谋，正在坚定不移地进行斗争。
    由于美帝国主义采取了反共反中国的政策、由于与之合作的日本统治阶层执行反民族反人民的政策，日本和中国的邦交直到战后十四年的今天还没有恢复。没有日中邦交的正常化和日苏和约的签订，远东的和平就没有保障。我们党保证同一切要求和平、要求日本独立和中立的日本人民一道，为早日恢复日本和中国的外交关系、为发展日中两国人民之间的交流和友谊而竭力奋斗。
    今年3月间访问贵国的我党代表团，在同中国共产党代表团一同发表的联合声明中，曾经确认美帝国主义是亚洲和世界人民的共同敌人，并指出了日中两国人民所面临的各项重要问题和共同的事业。我们党正在努力具体贯彻这项联合声明中的精神，而且今后还将继续做出更大的努力。
    我们党和日本人民都强烈地要求早日恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。
    我们党和日本人民都确信，庆祝光荣的建国十周年的中国人民将在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，在社会主义建设中取得更大的成功和伟大的成就。
    正在移山倒海般地进行社会主义建设的中华人民共和国建国十周年万岁！
    取得了革命胜利并在社会主义建设中正在取得伟大成就的中国人民万岁！
    领导中国革命取得胜利和领导社会主义建设的中国共产党万岁！
    日中两国人民的友谊和团结万岁！
    争取和平、民族解放和社会主义的全世界人民的团结万岁！
