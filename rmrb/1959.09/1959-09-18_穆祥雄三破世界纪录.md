On the Mid-Autumn Festival evening, a thrilling men's 100-meter breaststroke final was held at the Beijing Gymnasium swimming pool.

More and more foreign guests and spectators from the capital arrived. When the starting gun fired, Mu Xiangxiong, with his unique heroic posture, jumped into the water. The whole audience erupted in applause, unanimously cheering and hoping that Mu Xiangxiong, who had already broken the world record twice, would once again win glory for the motherland.

People's hearts were pounding like taut bowstrings. Mu Xiangxiong, speeding through the water, was like a dragon getting water, advancing rapidly in the blue waves. Look, our aquatic athlete is swimming with the unique Chinese breaststroke style - the "semi-high navigation" technique - using the power of his legs. Water splashed in front of and behind him as his body rapidly moved forward in the water. In a short period, Mu Xiangxiong was the first to swim the first fifty meters. "Turn!" The audience shouted in unison. Mu Xiangxiong's fingers sharply touched the edge of the pool, and he turned around swiftly. The whole audience burst into wild cheers. After turning around, Mu Xiangxiong started with one stroke and one breath, and after twenty meters, he changed to two strokes and one breath. When he was only five meters from the finish line, he used three strokes and one breath, with a fierce "sprint," and was the first to reach the finish line. "Fast," "Mu Xiangxiong," "Look, I guarantee he's broken the world record again." Before the record was announced, a burst of cheers resounded through the hall.

The results were about to be announced, and suddenly the swimming pool was silent. When the announcer said over the loudspeaker, "Mu Xiangxiong's 100-meter breaststroke time is one minute, eleven and one-tenth seconds, breaking the world record for the third time," the emotions of the crowd reached a climax. They applauded, cheered, and jumped up. Before Mu Xiangxiong even emerged from the water, some people rushed to congratulate Mu Xiangxiong's father, Mu Chengkuan, a famous old swimmer in China. Then Mu Xiangxiong came out of the water, and Mu Chengkuan immediately hugged him. The old man shed tears of excitement, and his son's eyes were also glistening with tears. Mu Chengkuan looked at his son's rosy face and said, "Good, Xiangxiong, you finally didn't disappoint everyone's expectations these days. Glory belongs to the Party, belongs to the Party." Chief Judge Jia Yurui came to congratulate the father and son, saying, "Good, Xiangxiong, breaking the previous record by zero point two seconds in one go is amazing in the world."

The girls, representing the feelings of China's 600 million people, presented a bouquet of flowers to Mu Xiangxiong. Mu Xiangxiong, holding the flowers, circled the arena, paying his respects to the audience. Many people stretched their hands down from the stands to shake hands with Mu Xiangxiong. The sound of "Long live the Great Leap Forward! Long live the General Line!" echoed from the loudspeakers.

    穆祥雄三破世界纪录
    新华社记者　文品　说传
    中秋节的晚上，北京体育馆游泳馆举行了一场扣人心弦的男子百米蛙泳决赛。
    外国的来宾和首都的观众越来越多了。当发令枪一响，穆祥雄以独有的英姿，跳入水中，全场顿时掌声雷动，一致在欢呼和期望两破世界纪录的穆祥雄再次为祖国争光。
    人心蹦得像拉紧的弓弦，急驰在水里的穆祥雄宛如蛟龙得水，在碧波中飞速前进。看呀，我们这位水上的健儿，游出了中国蛙泳独特风格——“半高航”式的游法，发挥了他双腿的力量，水花在他身前身后飞溅，人体在水上急速前进，在短短的时间内，穆祥雄就最先游完了前五十米。“倒！”观众不约而同地喊了一声。只见穆祥雄手指猛地向池边一蹭，刷地转过身来，全场观众顿时狂呼起来，穆祥雄调过身后，开始时用的是一划一呼吸，二十米后就改用两划一呼吸、当离终点只有五米的时候，他用三划一呼吸，一个猛“冲刺”，最先到达终点。“快呀”，“穆祥雄”，“你瞧吧，保证又打破了世界纪录”。纪录尚未公布，一片欢呼声响彻大厅。
    要宣布成绩了，顿时游泳馆里鸦雀无声，当从扩音器里传出“穆祥雄百米蛙泳一分十一秒一，第三次打破了世界纪录”的时候，全场的人群情绪达到了高潮，他们鼓着掌，欢呼着跳了起来，穆祥雄还未出水面，有的人就赶忙抱着穆祥雄的父亲、中国有名的老游泳家穆成宽祝贺。接着穆祥雄上水，穆成宽立即和他拥抱在一起。老人激动地流下了眼泪，儿子的眼圈也在闪着泪花。穆成宽望着儿子红润的脸孔说，好啊，祥雄，这几天总算没有辜负了大家的希望，光荣归功于党，归功于党。总裁判贾玉瑞过来祝贺他们父子说，“好啊，祥雄一次就以零点二秒的成绩冲破前次纪录，在世界上也是惊人的。”
    姑娘们代表着中国六亿人民的心意把一束鲜花献给了穆祥雄，穆祥雄抱着鲜花绕场一周，向观众们致意。许多人把手从看台伸下来争着和穆祥雄握手，扩音器中响起了“大跃进万岁！总路线万岁！”的声音。
