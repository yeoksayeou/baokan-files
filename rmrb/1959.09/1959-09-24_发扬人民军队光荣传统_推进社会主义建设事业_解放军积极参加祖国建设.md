Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: In the ten years since shifting from the war years to peaceful construction, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Army and actively participated in the cause of national construction. While consolidating national defense and strengthening modernization, they have appeared on all fronts of national industrial, agricultural, and transportation construction as a shock force for socialist construction, building more than 4,600 kilometers of railways, more than 13,900 kilometers of highways, and tens of thousands of water conservancy projects for the motherland.

During the war years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army always shouldered three major tasks: fighting, doing mass work, and engaging in production. Over the past ten years, they have further inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army and contributed to socialist construction. In 1949, when the mainland of China was just liberated, while suppressing armed bandits and stabilizing social order, they dispatched 100,000 troops to the western section of the Longhai Railway, rapidly repairing the railways between Tianshui and Baoji, and Tianshui and Lanzhou. They also sent 100,000 people to Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, Yunnan Tin Mine, Qinghai Gold Mine and other places to work with the workers to clear weeds, build factories, and help restore production. Subsequently, with the heroic spirit of "making the mountains bow and the rivers give way," they braved wind and dew, building railways and highways in the overlapping mountains of the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, on the upper reaches of the Yellow River and the waist of the Kunlun Mountains, on the banks of the Jinsha River and on the Que'er Mountain. At the Huai River control site, the Guanting Reservoir, the Jingjiang River diversion and other places, more than 100,000 officers and soldiers worked day and night, digging rivers and building dikes, participating in the emergency repair of water conservancy projects. Later, they also participated in the construction of national famous major projects such as the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Hunsha Canal, and the Ming Tombs Reservoir. In recent years, more than 7 million cadres and soldiers have been transferred and demobilized to the industrial and agricultural fronts. Among them, more than 30 regimented divisions and nearly 100,000 technical personnel have gone to the border areas of the motherland to reclaim wasteland and build farms, producing grain and economic crops for the country.

Over the past ten years, this People's Army, with its high political awareness and long-term war training, has shouldered arduous engineering tasks in national construction. Wherever labor is most needed, they set up camp; wherever it is most dangerous, they bravely launch an attack. The Kangzang Highway was built on the "Roof of the World," with the entire line averaging more than 3,000 meters above sea level. During the construction, it was necessary to pass through 14 mountains with sparse population and thin air, and more than ten turbulent rivers such as the Nujiang and Jinsha Rivers. The soldiers conquered glaciers, quicksand, frozen soil, cliffs, rapids, and severe and changeable climate with the heroic spirit of fighting north and south in the past. They fought for a full five years to make the entire 2,255-kilometer highway open to traffic. The steep Tianshan Mountains divide Xinjiang into two halves, and the local people have been looking forward to a smooth road through it for many years. In the past, there was a myth that "no one can open the millennium ice peak, waiting for the fairy to descend to earth," which has been realized by the People's soldiers today. When building the Urumqi-Korla highway, the soldiers used steel ropes to climb over the steep cliffs and ice peaks that were inaccessible, and fought with frozen soil and iron rocks in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees. Under the heroic slogan of "cutting off the waist of the Tianshan Mountains and cutting off the head of the Tianshan Mountains," the project, which was planned to be completed in three years, was completed in one and a half years.

The Railway Corps is a fighting force that repaired many railways under artillery fire in the past. The Huaihe River Bridge on the Jinpu Railway was blown to pieces by the enemy, and they repaired it in only two months. They also only took 59 days to repair the No. 8 Bridge on the Longhai Road, which was known as "impossible to escape." In the first year of the founding of the country, they repaired 267 bridges, 146 kilometers of railways, and more than 9,000 kilometers of communication lines on the three major trunk lines of Longhai, Jinghan, and Yuehan, as well as the railways of Zhegan and Tongpu. In recent years, the railway construction projects they have undertaken have also been extremely difficult. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway they built runs through the mountains and the Daheshan Tunnel is one of the longest tunnels in China. The Xiamen Seawall they built together with the migrant workers is called a miracle of "moving mountains and filling the sea." The Baotou-Yinchuan section of the Baolan Railway they contracted to build will cross the Yellow River twice, pass through the four major trunk canals of Hetao seven times, and also pass through the Erdos Plateau and the desert sea. The area is covered with yellow dust all year round, water is extremely scarce, and the weather is cold, making the road construction conditions very harsh. They conquered the desert, overcame the extreme cold and water shortage, and completed the second railway trunk line in Northwest China ahead of schedule.

The troops participating in the construction of the border areas have overcome various difficulties and made outstanding achievements. The first soldiers who arrived in Xinjiang lived in burrows, ate boiled wheat, dug open the ice and snow on the ancient wilderness, and wielded their shovels day after day, reclaiming wasteland and building canals, turning more than 7 million mu of wasteland and swamps into fertile fields. The demobilized soldiers in the Great Northern Wilderness opened up more than 5 million mu of cultivated land in the place where geese gathered and tigers and wolves inhabited. The military reclamation farms in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and next to Bohai Bay have also reclaimed large areas of land. The cotton, soybeans and grain they produce have supplied civilian food and military use. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Halichabu Lake has been sleeping on the grassland. The soldiers braved the strong wind and heavy snow to find the treasure, and launched a battle to "ask alkali from the ice lake" in the cold winter. Inside and outside the Great Wall, there are also a group of soldiers who live in barren mountains and ridges all year round, planting trees and afforestation, greening the mountains and rivers of the motherland.

On the water conservancy construction sites, the officers and soldiers are all working shoulder to shoulder with the people in a fighting posture. The Ming Tombs Reservoir had to be completed before the flood arrived, and the troops invested half of the manpower needed for the entire project, breaking ground in the severe winter and fighting day and night, so that the project was completed on time. More than 10,000 officers and soldiers participated in the construction of the Miyun Reservoir, and they undertook the most arduous projects such as cutting slopes and digging tunnels. Because they overfulfilled their tasks every day, ten military industrial support teams won ten championship red flags. On these construction sites, gray-haired old generals and young soldiers carried soil and stones together; battle-tested one-armed heroes and migrant workers fought side by side; the heroic deeds of martyrs such as Liu Jin, who sacrificed their lives to block the breach of the dam that was broken by the flood, became a force to encourage people to strive to build the motherland.

Various military branches and arms have also supported industrial and agricultural construction with a large number of modern equipment and technical forces. In recent years, the People's Air Force has continuously sent planes to transport materials to industrial bases such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel, to airdrop supplies to disaster areas, to bomb ice dams in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, to spread pesticides on farmland suffering from insect pests, and to airdrop feed for sheep trapped by heavy snow. On the oceans of the motherland, the People's Navy treats fishermen and sailors as brothers, rescues them in times of danger, and helps them in times of distress. Once, when there was a storm in the East China Sea, naval vessels went out at night and patrolled the fishing grounds for three days and three nights, finding 411 fishing boats in distress and rescuing more than 900 fishermen who had fallen into the water. They also sent warships to help local shipping departments transport goods and passengers, doing everything possible to support national construction. In the communications corps, the officers and soldiers are actively installing telephone lines and radios for the countryside. The armored兵, engineers, artillery and logistics departments have also trained a group of tractor drivers, car drivers, engineering technicians, medical personnel and various technicians for the countryside. Some troops have also assisted people's communes in building factories, opening hospitals, and running many welfare undertakings.

The army's participation in national construction is carried out under the unified leadership of the local party committee. In labor, officers and soldiers often share joys and sorrows and work together with the people, which greatly strengthens the relationship between the army and the government and between the army and the people. In recent years, many troops and local party organizations have carried out comprehensive cooperation from production and construction to political and ideological education, cultural life, and militia training on the basis of mutual support. During the busy farming season, the military and civilians work together to rush to plant and harvest; in the event of natural disasters, the military and civilians work side by side to fight drought and flood. In some coastal areas, the army and the people also work together to wipe out the enemy, go to sea to fish together, and go to night school to study culture together. Once, a gale blew for more than 40 days on the sea of ​​Yushan Islands, traffic was cut off, and the fishermen ran out of food. The soldiers took out their own food, drank porridge with the fishermen, and spent the storm together. At the same time, the troops have also received strong support from the people. When the troops want to build barracks, the people help transport bricks, tiles and wood; when the troops carry out agricultural and sideline production, the people's communes send technicians. Sometimes when the troops go out on duty, the people of the garrison also take the initiative to help turn the ground, sow seeds, water vegetables, and feed pigs. During holidays or rest time, the people in these areas often bring baskets and cans to the troops to "visit relatives," and the soldiers often go to the people's communes to visit "relatives." The people compiled ballads praising this military-civilian friendship and said: "The army and the people are as close as flesh and blood, and they are of one heart in harmony; the army helps the people, the people help the army, and work hand in hand to leap forward together."

In the process of participating in national construction, the army has greatly improved the political consciousness of officers and soldiers. Many people said in their work: After I have personally seen the scale and prospects of national construction, and seen the soaring energy and majestic strength of the people, I have strengthened my determination and will to defend the motherland and build the motherland. Over the past ten years, officers and soldiers have deeply realized that in the period of peaceful construction, the army's participation in national construction is an important subject to maintain close ties with the people and absorb nutrition from the people to enrich itself.

    发扬人民军队光荣传统　推进社会主义建设事业
    解放军积极参加祖国建设
    新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军在从战争年代转向和平建设的十年中，发扬了人民军队的光荣传统，积极参加了祖国建设事业。他们在巩固国防、加强现代化建设的同时，作为社会主义建设的一支突击力量，出现在祖国的工业、农业、交通运输业等各个生产建设战线上，为祖国修下了四千六百多公里铁路，一万三千九百多公里公路和数万项水利工程。
    中国人民解放军在战争年代，一直担负着打仗、做群众工作、进行生产的三大任务。十年来，他们进一步继承和发扬了人民军队的光荣传统，为社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。1949年，全国大陆刚刚解放的时候，他们在剿灭武装匪特安定社会秩序的同时，以十万大军开赴陇海铁路西段，迅速修复了天水——宝鸡、天水——兰州间的铁路。又派出十万人到鞍山钢铁厂、云南锡矿、青海淘金场等地，和工人一起铲荒草，修厂房，帮助恢复生产。接着，他们以“让高山低头，叫河水让路”的英雄气概，在万山重叠的成渝路上，在黄河上游和昆仑山腰，在金沙江畔和雀儿山上，风餐露宿，修建铁路和公路。在治淮工地、官厅水库、荆江分洪等处，十万多名官兵披星戴月，挖河筑堤，参加抢修水利工程。以后，他们还参加了鹰厦铁路、包兰铁路、武汉长江大桥、第一汽车制造厂、浑沙渠道、十三陵水库等全国有名的重大工程的修建工作。几年来，有七百多万名干部和战士，转业、复员到工农业战线上。其中有三十多个成建制的师，近十万名技术人员开赴到祖国的边疆，垦荒地，建农场，为国家生产粮食和经济作物。
    十年来，这支具有高度政治觉悟久经战争锻炼的人民军队，在国家建设中，一直担负着艰巨的工程任务。哪里最需要劳动力，他们就到哪里安营扎寨；哪里最艰险，他们就在哪里奋勇突击。康藏公路修建在“世界屋脊”上，全线工程平均在海拔三千米以上，施工中要穿过人迹稀少、空气稀薄的十四座大山和怒江、金沙江等十多条激流。战士们以往日南征北战的英雄气概，征服了冰川、流沙、冻土、悬崖、激流和严寒多变的气候，战斗了整整五年，使全长二千二百五十五公里的公路全线通车。险峻的天山，把新疆分为南北两面，当地人民多年就盼望有一条阳关大道穿行其间。过去流传着：“千年冰峰无人开，要等仙女下凡来”的神话，今天被人民战士实现了。在修建这条乌鲁木齐到库尔勒公路的时候，战士们用钢绳攀过削壁千仞、无路可登的冰峰，在零下三十度的严寒里，与冻土、铁岩搏斗。在“斩断天山腰，砍掉天山头”的豪迈口号下，计划三年完工的工程，一年半完成了。
    铁道兵是一支有战斗作风的部队，当年在炮火底下抢修过许多条铁路。津浦路上的淮河大桥，被敌人炸得支离破碎，他们只用了两个月时间就修好了。修复陇海路上被称为“插翅难飞”的八号桥，他们也仅用了五十九天。在建国初期的一年中，他们在陇海、京汉、粤汉三大干线和浙赣、同蒲等铁路线上，修复的桥梁有二百六十七座，铁路一百四十六公里，通信线路九千多公里。近几年来，他们所担负的铁路修建工程也异常艰巨。他们修建的鹰厦铁路，穿行在丛山峻岭间，所开凿的大禾山隧道是我国最长的隧道之一，他们和民工一起修成的厦门海堤被称为
  “移山填海”的奇迹。他们包修的包兰铁路的包头——银川段，要两跨黄河，七过河套四大干渠，还要穿过额尔多斯高原和沙漠瀚海。沿线终年黄尘漫天，水源奇缺，加上天气寒冷，修路条件十分恶劣。他们征服了沙漠，战胜奇寒水缺，使大西北的第二条铁路干线提前完工。
    参加边疆建设的部队，克服了种种困难，也作出了优异成绩。最初到新疆的战士，宿地窝，吃煮麦，在亘古的荒原上挖开冰雪，抡起砍土馒，日复一日，开荒筑渠，使七百多万亩荒地、沼泽变成了良田。北大荒的转业军人在那大雁成群，虎狼栖身的地方，开出了五百多万亩耕地。甘肃河西走廊和渤海湾旁的军垦农场，也都开垦了大片的土地。他们生产的棉花、大豆和粮食，已供应着民食军用。在内蒙古自治区，哈里查布湖一直沉睡在草原上，战士们冒着狂风大雪，探得了宝藏，在三九隆冬发起了向“冰湖要碱”的战斗。在长城内外，还有一批战士长年居住在荒山秃岭上，植树造林，绿化着祖国的山河。
    在水利建设工地上，官兵们都是以战斗姿态，与人民群众并肩劳动。十三陵水库要在洪水到来前完工，部队投入了整个工程所需人力的一半，严冬破土，昼夜奋战，使这一工程按时完成。密云水库有万余官兵参加修建，他们担负的是劈坡、开隧道等最艰巨的工程，由于他们每天都超额完成任务，十个军工支队荣获了十面冠军红旗。在这些工地上，白发苍苍的老将军和青年战士一起担土运石；战功累累的独臂英雄和民工并肩作战；刘锦等烈士为堵住被洪水冲破的大坝决口，献出自己生命的英雄事迹，成了鼓舞人们奋发建设祖国的力量。
    各个军种、兵种还以大量的现代化装备和技术力量，支援了工农业建设事业。几年来，人民空军不断派出飞机，为武钢、包钢等工业基地运送材料，到灾区空投物资，往黄河上游轰炸冰坝，给遭受虫害的农田撒放灭虫药粉，为大雪围困的羊群空投饲料等。人民海军在祖国的海洋上，对渔民、船员亲如兄弟，遇险抢险，遇难救难。有一次，东海上遇到狂风暴雨，海军的舰艇星夜出动，在渔场上巡行了三天三夜，找回了遇险的四百十一只渔船，救出了九百多名落水渔民。他们还派出舰艇，帮助地方航运部门运送物品和旅客，千方百计支援着国家建设。在通信兵部队里，广大官兵正在积极为农村架电话线，安广播器。装甲兵、工程兵、炮兵和后勤部门等，也为农村培养了一批拖拉机手、汽车驾驶员、工程技术员、医务人员和各种技术工人。有的部队还协助人民公社建工厂，开医院，兴办了不少福利事业。
    军队参加国家建设是在地方党委统一领导下进行的。劳动中，官兵们常常和人民群众共甘苦、同劳动，这就大大密切了军政关系和军民关系。近年来，许多部队和地方党组织在相互支援的基础上，从生产建设到政治思想教育工作、文化生活、民兵训练等进行全面协作。农忙季节，军民一起抢种抢收；遇到自然灾害，军民并肩抗旱防洪。沿海有些地方，军队和人民还一起歼灭敌人，一起下海捕鱼，一起上夜校学文化。有一次，渔山列岛海面刮了四十多天大风，交通断绝，渔民断了粮，战士们拿出自己的粮食，同渔民一起喝稀饭，共度风灾。在这同时，部队也得到了人民群众的大力支援。部队要盖营房，人民群众帮助运送砖瓦木料；部队进行农副业生产，人民公社派来了技术人员，有时部队外出执勤，驻地人民还主动帮助翻地、下种、浇菜、喂猪。在假日或休息时间，这些地区的人民群众常常提篮携罐来部队“串门”，战士们也常常到人民公社去走“亲戚”。人民群众编歌谣颂扬这种军民友情说：“军与民，骨肉亲，鱼水相处心连心；军帮民，民帮军，携手并肩齐跃进。”
    军队在参加国家建设中，大大提高了官兵们的政治觉悟。许多人在劳动中说：我亲眼见到国家建设的规模和远景，看到人民的冲天干劲和雄伟力量之后，增强了保卫祖国，建设祖国的决心和意志。十年来，官兵们深深体会到：在和平建设时期，军队参加国家建设是保持与人民群众密切联系，并从人民群众中吸取营养，丰富自己的重要课题。
