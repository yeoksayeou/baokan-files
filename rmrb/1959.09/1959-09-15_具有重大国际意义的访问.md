    A Visit of Great International Significance

    Today, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev, will depart for a visit to the United States; yesterday, the second Soviet cosmic rocket launched accurately reached the moon. These are two major events in current international life. One is the first visit by a Soviet head of government to the United States in the history of international relations, and the other is the first flight in human history from Earth to another planet. The coincidence of the two events brings boundless excitement and hope to all peace-loving people around the world. Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the United States marks another major effort by the Soviet Union to strive for the relaxation of international tensions and to safeguard world peace.

    Mutual visits between heads of government of different countries have been recognized in the post-war era as an appropriate way to negotiate solutions to pressing current issues of concern to the parties involved, and we have seen many such mutual visits between heads of state. However, mutual visits between the heads of government of the two countries that occupy the most important position in contemporary international life—the Soviet Union and the United States—is something that all those who advocate easing international tensions have demanded for many years, but has not yet been achieved. The Soviet Union and the United States are currently the two strongest countries in the world, one is the most advanced and powerful country in the socialist camp, and the other is the most powerful country in the capitalist world. Their mutual relations have a huge impact on the entire international situation, and this is universally recognized. Therefore, mutual visits between the leaders of the two countries to discuss and resolve pressing international issues are an important step in promoting the melting of the "Cold War" iceberg. All peace-loving people have reason to be pleased about Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the United States. Comrade Khrushchev will be visiting the United States for a period of thirteen days. During his visit, Comrade Khrushchev will hold talks with U.S. President Eisenhower and will have extensive contacts with people from all walks of life in the United States. This will undoubtedly have a positive effect on promoting a better understanding of the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy by the broad masses of the American people, on promoting the improvement of Soviet-American relations, and on easing international tensions.

    Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the United States is, in itself, a victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Especially since the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union has made a series of efforts to ease international tensions. The Soviet government has proposed concluding a peace treaty with Germany, ending the occupation regime in West Berlin, and convening a summit conference of great powers, and has made significant efforts to this end at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference. However, because the United States has not abandoned its aggressive ambitions and has consistently adopted a rigid policy, these issues have not been resolved reasonably to this day. This approach by the U.S. authorities can only subject it to increasing opposition, putting it in an increasingly passive and isolated position, while the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has generated an increasingly greater impact in international life, even in the United States, where Cold War propaganda permeates. In the United States, there is a growing demand for improved U.S.-Soviet relations and the easing of international tensions, while the Cold War policy is becoming increasingly unpopular. This is the background against which the U.S. government agreed to mutual visits between the heads of government of the United States and the Soviet Union.

    Of course, one cannot fail to notice that some forces in the United States who hope to profit from war policies and international tensions are extremely fearful of the impact that Khrushchev's visit to the United States will have. They are particularly afraid that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and the idea of peaceful coexistence will be further instilled in the hearts of the American people through this visit. From the day the Soviet Union and the United States announced the mutual visits of the heads of government of the two countries, they have been constantly clamoring for "boycotting" Khrushchev's visit and spreading an atmosphere of distrust and even hostility among the American people. At the same time, one cannot fail to notice that in recent times, although the U.S. government has said a lot about peace and about melting the "Cold War" iceberg, actual actions are more powerful than any beautiful words. In this regard, people see that the United States has not abandoned its fundamental policy of aggression and expansion, nor has it taken the substantive actions necessary to ease tensions. On the contrary, the Washington authorities are using the cloak of "loosening" diplomatic policy to cover up its continued creation of new and evil activities that create tension. In this regard, in Europe, the United States continues to keep the German question unresolved; in the East, the United States continues to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, step up its support for Japanese militarist forces, and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam, which is powerful proof. In particular, recently, the United States undermined the Geneva Accords, stepped up its military assistance to Laos, and used the Lao Sananikone government, which it single-handedly supported, to reignite the civil war in Laos. For all this, peace-loving forces around the world have reason to remain fully vigilant and persist in the unremitting struggle to expose and oppose U.S. aggression. Peace-loving forces around the world are deeply convinced that no matter how stubborn the aggressive forces headed by the United States may be, the general trend and the will of the people dictate that peace will ultimately prevail over war and justice will ultimately prevail over aggression.

    The Chinese people, who have always firmly supported the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, warmly welcome Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States. We believe that Comrade Khrushchev's trip to the United States will make new contributions to further easing international tensions and safeguarding the cause of world peace.

### 具有重大国际意义的访问

    具有重大国际意义的访问
    今天，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志将动身前往美国访问；昨天，苏联发射的第二个宇宙火箭已经准确地到达月球。这是当前国际生活中的两件大事，一个是国际关系史上第一次苏联政府首脑到美国的访问，一个是人类历史上第一次从地球到另一个星球的飞行，两者的巧合，给世界一切爱好和平的人们带来了无限的兴奋和希望。赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行，标志着苏联又一次为争取缓和国际紧张局势，维护世界和平的重大努力。
    这个国家和那个国家的政府首脑的相互访问，这在战后年代中已被公认为协商解决有关方面的当前迫切问题的适当方式之一，而且我们已经看到过许多次这样的国家首脑的相互访问了。但是，在当代国际生活中占有最重要地位的两个国家——苏联和美国政府的首脑的相互访问，却是多少年来一切主张缓和国际紧张局势的人们所要求而又未曾实现的事情。苏联和美国是现在世界上两个强国，一个是社会主义阵营中最先进最强大的国家，一个是资本主义世界最有势力的国家，它们的相互关系，对于整个国际局势，有着巨大的影响，这也是一致公认的。因之，两国首脑的互相访问，商讨和解决当前国际上的迫切问题，是促进“冷战”冰山消融的一个重要步骤。一切爱好和平的人们有理由对赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行感到高兴。这次赫鲁晓夫同志将在美国作为期十三天的访问。在访问期间，赫鲁晓夫同志将同美国总统艾森豪威尔举行会谈，并将和美国各阶层人士进行广泛的接触，这对于促进美国广大人民对苏联一贯奉行的和平外交政策获致进一步的了解，对于促进苏美两国关系的改善，对于缓和国际紧张局势，无疑将会产生良好的作用。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行，这一事实的本身，就意味着苏联和平外交政策的胜利。谁都知道，苏联一贯奉行和平外交政策，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处。特别是今年以来，苏联为缓和国际紧张局势，作出了一系列的努力。苏联政府建议缔结对德和约，结束西柏林占领制度，召开大国首脑会议，并且在日内瓦外长会议上为此而作了重大的努力。但是，由于美国不放弃它的侵略野心，一直采取僵硬的政策，这些问题迄今都没有得到合理的解决。美国当局的这种作法，显然只能使它遭到越来越大的反对，使它陷于日益被动和孤立，而苏联和平外交政策则在国际生活中产生了越来越大的影响，甚至在弥漫冷战宣传的美国也不能例外。在美国，要求改善美苏关系、缓和国际紧张局势的呼声越来越高，而冷战政策则越来越不得人心。这就是美国政府同意美苏两国首脑相互访问的背景。
    当然，人们不能不注意到，美国的一些指望从战争政策和国际紧张局势中谋取利益的势力，对赫鲁晓夫访美所将发生的影响怀着极大的恐惧，它们特别害怕苏联的和平外交政策、和平共处的思想将通过这次访问而更加深入美国的人心。它们从苏美两国宣布两国政府首脑实行互相访问之日起，就不断叫嚣“抵制”赫鲁晓夫的访问，在美国人民中散播不信任的以至敌对的空气。同时，人们也不能不注意到，最近一个时期，尽管美国政府说了许多关于和平、关于融解“冷战”冰山的话，但是，实际行动比任何漂亮言词更有力。在这方面，人们看到美国没有放弃它的侵略扩张的根本政策，也没有采取为缓和紧张局势所必需的实质性的行动。相反地，华盛顿当局却以外交政策有所“松动”的外衣，掩护它继续制造紧张局势的新的罪恶活动。在这方面，在欧洲，美国继续使德国问题僵持不决；在东方，美国继续霸占中国领土台湾，加紧扶植日本军国主义势力，阻挠朝鲜和越南的和平统一，就是有力的证明。特别是最近，美国破坏日内瓦协议，加紧对老挝的军事援助，利用它一手扶植的老挝萨纳尼空政府，重新挑起了老挝的内战。对于这一切，全世界爱好和平力量有理由保持充分的警惕，并坚持揭露和反对美国的侵略活动的不懈的斗争。全世界爱好和平力量深信，不管以美国为首的侵略势力怎样顽固不化，大势所趋，人心所向，和平终将胜过战争，正义终将压倒侵略。
    一贯坚决支持苏联和平外交政策的中国人民，热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国。我们相信，赫鲁晓夫同志的美国之行，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平事业，将会作出新的贡献。
