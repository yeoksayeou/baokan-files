To Run a Good Canteen, Thrift is Indispensable

    Everyone who has visited the Huijiang Canteen of the Chengjiang Commune in Huangyan, Zhejiang, says that this canteen is run well. The commune members of the Huijiang team praise their canteen, saying, "The leadership attaches importance to good management, everything is taken care of very thoughtfully, the canteen is run excellently, who would want to cook for themselves?"

    The main reason this canteen is run so well is its thriftiness in operation.

    The Huijiang team's Party branch emphasizes thrift in everything they do, and running the canteen is no exception. From the very first day of running the canteen, the Party branch secretary, Comrade Zhang Youfa, told everyone, "To run the canteen well, the two words 'thrift and diligence' are indispensable."

    How is "diligence" implemented in running the canteen? The Huijiang team's Party branch focuses on planting melons and vegetables. After the autumn harvest last year, the Party branch began to organize a vegetable production team for the canteen, led by probationary Party member and Communist Youth League secretary, Comrade Zhang Afa. To produce more vegetables, the vegetable production team made full use of scattered plots of land such as roadsides, riverbanks, fields and small tangerine mounds, planting vegetables, beans, and melons wherever possible. Whatever was good to plant in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, they planted. On these plots of land, the vegetable team grew various vegetables, which, in addition to meeting the needs of their own canteen, sold for more than 5,000 yuan in the first half of the year. It is estimated that another 5,000 yuan or so can be earned by the autumn harvest.

    The emphasis on "diligence" is so prominent, the emphasis on "thrift" is also very clear. The Huijiang team's Party branch pays attention to the canteen's economy at all times. During the autumn harvest last year, some cadres and commune members believed that since there was a bumper harvest of grain, grain rationing should be abolished. The Party branch held various meetings specifically on this issue, using facts to explain to cadres and commune members the benefits of implementing grain rationing for saving grain, thus ensuring that the method of rationed supply was maintained.

    In order to save grain, around the Spring Festival, the Party branch also educated commune members to eat more rice and less pastries, more Jing rice and less glutinous rice. The commune members reflected: this proposal is very good. The Party branch sent people to transport the glutinous rice and glutinous rice kept for food to various teams to exchange for Jing rice. Jing rice has a high rice yield, and a lot of grain was saved. Under the constant education of the Party branch, the canteen also planned its use of grain, leaving nothing uneaten at each meal. Therefore, this team has saved 2,800 jin of grain within the grain rationing limit from the autumn harvest last year to the summer of this year.

    In order to save expenses, the Party branch has also held several meetings to study and improve the canteen's stoves to save firewood. Party branch secretary Zhang Youfa and accountant Zhang Youjin learned from the experience of other places and changed two stoves into one stove with four pots, two pots for cooking rice and two pots for boiling water, saving 3,000 jin of firewood per month.

### 食堂办得好勤俭不可少

    食堂办得好勤俭不可少
    凡是到过浙江黄岩澄江公社汇江食堂的人，都说这个食堂办得好。汇江队的社员更是人人称赞自己的食堂，他们说：“领导重视管理好，样样照顾很周到，食堂办得刮刮叫，哪个愿意自己烧？”
    这个食堂所以办得好，勤俭经营是最主要的一条经验。
    汇江队党支部无论办什么事都讲勤俭，对于办食堂当然也不例外。从办食堂的第一天起，支部书记张友法同志就对大家说：“要把食堂办得好，‘勤俭’二字不可少。”
    办食堂怎么个“勤”法？汇江队党支部着重抓住了种瓜种菜这一环。去年秋收以后，党支部就着手组织食堂蔬菜专业队，由预备党员、团支部书记张阿法同志负责领导。蔬菜专业队为了多产蔬菜，就充分利用路边、河岸、道地和小桔墩等零星土地，见缝插针，到处种菜、种豆、种瓜。春夏秋冬，什么好种，就种什么。就在这些土地上，蔬菜队种出的各种蔬菜，除了满足自己食堂的需要以外，上半年还卖了五千多元。估计到秋收，还可卖五千元左右。
    “勤”字如此突出，“俭”字也很鲜明。汇江队党支部时时刻刻注意食堂的节约。去年秋收时，有些干部、社员认为粮食大丰收了，应该取消粮食定量。党支部就专为这个问题召开了各种会议，用事实向干部、社员说明实行粮食定量对于节约粮食的好处，这样就使定量供给的办法坚持了下来。
    为了节约粮食，春节前后，党支部还教育社员多吃饭、少吃糕，多吃京米、少吃糯米。社员反映：这个主张很好。党支部就派人把留作口粮的糯谷糯米运到各队去换京米。京米出饭率高，粮食节约了很多。在党支部的经常教育下，食堂内也做到计划用粮，餐餐不剩。因此，这个队从去年秋收到今年夏天，已在粮食定量范围内节约了二千八百斤粮食。
    为了节约开支，党支部还数次开会研究改进食堂的锅灶，节约烧柴。党支部书记张友法和会计张友金学习了外地的经验，把二个锅灶改成一个一灶四锅，二锅煮饭，二锅烧茶，每月可节约三千斤木柴。
