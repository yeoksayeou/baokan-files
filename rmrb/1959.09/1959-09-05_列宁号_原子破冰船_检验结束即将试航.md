Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 4th. The inspection of all machinery and equipment of the "Lenin," the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker, has recently been completed and will soon undergo sea trials.

　　The ship's three nuclear reactors have already started operating. The ship's personnel control all the working processes of these reactors from the control panel, which is far away from the reactors.

　　The stern propeller has undergone a test run, and the results are good.

　　The staff’s inspection of the power generation equipment was conducted via television.

    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联的世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”全部机件和装置的检验工作最近已告结束，不久即将出海试航。
    船上三个原子反应堆已经开始工作。船上的工作人员在离反应堆很远的地方，通过操纵台来控制这些反应堆的一切工作过程。
    船尾的螺旋推进器经过了试运转，结果良好。
    工作人员对发电装置的检查都是通过电视进行的。在电视机的荧光屏上，可以清楚地看到发电机工作的情况和船尾、船头两个发电站之间的联系情况。破冰船有四个汽轮发电机，船尾、船头各两个；它们发出强大的电力供船上各种电力设备的需要。
