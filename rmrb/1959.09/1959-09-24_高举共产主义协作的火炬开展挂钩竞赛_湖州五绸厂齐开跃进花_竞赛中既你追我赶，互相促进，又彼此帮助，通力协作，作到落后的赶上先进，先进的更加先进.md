Raise High the Torch of Communist Cooperation and Launch Hookup Competitions
Huzhou's Five Silk Factories Simultaneously Bloom with Great Leap Forward Flowers
In the Competition, They Chase Each Other, Promote Each Other, Help Each Other, and Work Together to Ensure That the Backward Catch Up with the Advanced, and the Advanced Become Even More Advanced.

(Reported from Hangzhou on the 23rd by this newspaper) Since the beginning of this year, the five silk factories in Huzhou City, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province – Dachang, Yongchang, Hufeng, Huzhou, and Dailin – have launched hookup competitions, with the advanced Dachang Silk Factory as their benchmark. In the competition, the workers of each factory chased each other and promoted each other, while also fully promoting the spirit of Communist cooperation, with everyone helping each other when one factory was in need, achieving common improvement. From January to August, these five silk factories completed their production plans very well. The total output value completed 101.88% of the state plan, an increase of 39.54% over the same period last year; the output exceeded the state plan by 106,290 meters, an increase of 51.45% over the same period last year; in terms of quality, the first-class rate of silk fabrics reached 99.17%, an increase of 2.19% over the same period last year. Labor productivity increased compared to last year, profits increased compared to last year, and costs also decreased.

The outstanding achievement of the competition among these five factories is: the backward catching up with the advanced, and the advanced becoming even more advanced. Dailin Silk Weaving Factory, which was recently transformed from a silk weaving production cooperative into a factory, originally had poor production conditions. Through its own efforts in the competition, and with the help of other factories, it leaped to become an advanced factory in February and won the inter-factory competition red flag. Yongchang Silk Factory was originally a so-called factory that was "not as good as the top, but better than the bottom." In the competition, the workers of this factory felt that they could not "settle for the middle reaches," and they quickly caught up. Production was particularly outstanding from March to May, and they continuously won the inter-factory competition red flag. The achievements of these factories encouraged the Dachang Silk Factory, which had always been advanced in production. The workers were even more motivated, and in June, all production indicators were overfulfilled. The first-class rate of silk fabrics reached 99.99%, once again setting a new national quality record and regaining the red flag.

The inter-factory competition of the five silk factories in Huzhou City was launched on the basis of summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year. The workers of each factory studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, discussed the great achievements and experiences of last year, as well as the situation and favorable conditions for continuing the leap forward this year, thereby generally improving their understanding. On this basis, the Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a mobilization meeting of more than 2,000 people in the silk weaving industry to practice their skills, conduct a grand competition, and select heroes, setting off a wave of production competition. Each factory was linked to each other and launched a red flag competition with monthly evaluations. Since Dachang Silk Factory is a red flag in the silk weaving industry of the whole province, and the quality of the silk fabrics produced is the best in the country, Yongchang, Hufeng, and other silk factories put forward the slogan "Learn from Dachang, catch up with Dachang," while Dachang Silk Factory also put forward the slogan "Greatly boost enthusiasm, make an all-round leap forward, and vow to compete with the whole country for advancement."

After the launch of the inter-factory competition, the workers of each factory not only cared about their own production, but also paid close attention to the production of other factories and the production of other workers in their own factory. At the entrance of each factory, the production progress of each factory and the production achievements of each worker in the factory were announced every morning. Once workers discovered a new record of high yield and high quality, they tried every means to catch up to this goal. In the past few months, the workers of each factory have learned from each other through visits, exchanges, on-site meetings, and exhibitions. In the previous period, the silk fabric production of Yongchang Silk Factory had a low first-class rate due to the poor quality of semi-finished products; Dachang Silk Factory, through summarizing production experience, found the trick to improve semi-finished products. The leaders of Yongchang Silk Factory organized workers to go to Dachang Silk Factory to learn, and as a result, the defective products caused by the poor quality of semi-finished products were eliminated, and the daily output increased from more than 2,000 meters below the plan to more than 2,000 meters above the plan. Hufeng Silk Factory, led by the general branch secretary, led a group of loom operators, maintenance workers, auxiliary workers, and administrative management cadres to Dachang Silk Factory to "learn from experience," learning many advanced experiences from production to enterprise management. After returning to the factory, they actively promoted these experiences, and the production outlook greatly changed, with both output and quality improving. The quality of silk fabrics such as B. Georgette has caught up with Dachang.

Many advanced experiences have been continuously enriched in mutual learning. For example, Yongchang Silk Factory learned the "single-spindle toothed shuttle car" created by Dachang Silk Factory and made some improvements based on the specific conditions of the factory, which improved work efficiency even more; later, Dachang Silk Factory also learned from Yongchang Silk Factory and further changed the single-spindle to double-spindle, which was even more efficient than Yongchang. This continuously reformed "double-spindle toothed shuttle car" has many advantages: it speeds up the car, improves efficiency, reduces downtime, avoids oil stains, and saves raw materials. For example, Hufeng Silk Factory experimented with using glutinous rice instead of oxhide paste as a silk sizing raw material, which was not successful, but accumulated some experience. Later, Dachang Silk Factory learned from Hufeng's practice and made some improvements, and the experiment was successful. Now each factory has widely promoted this experience.

The mutual assistance and close cooperation in the hookup competition of the five silk factories in Huzhou takes various forms, such as collective research, on-site consultations, and specific assistance in terms of technology or equipment. Many key production problems in each factory have been solved in this cooperation. Not long ago, Huzhou Silk Factory had more than 100 defective products when producing beautiful silk. The factory director of Dachang Silk Factory, with a stronger technical force, led technicians and workers to help carry out "on-site consultations." After inspection, it was found that the quality of the warp beams on the silk weaving machine was not good and needed to be replaced. Dachang Factory took the initiative to lend the warp beams from its own factory to Huzhou Silk Factory and told them how to improve operating techniques. In this way, the problem of Huzhou Factory was solved. When Yongchang Silk Factory was weaving 07 electric spun rayon, there was a problem with the quality. Hufeng Silk Factory had also experienced this problem before and overcame it after sending people to study at the silk factory in Shanghai. This time, Hufeng Silk Factory introduced the method of eliminating this problem to Yongchang, helping Yongchang to improve the first-class product rate.

Establishing benchmarks, and focusing on competitions between workshops, teams, and individuals, has made the inter-factory competition of the five silk factories in Huzhou in-depth and long-lasting. The deeds and experiences of Lu Xianglin, a loom operator at Dachang Silk Factory who has not produced defective products for three years, Qiu Alan, a loom operator at Yongchang Silk Factory who has had no defective products for more than 30 consecutive months, and Ye A'er, a famous advanced producer at Hufeng Silk Factory, have been widely spread among silk weaving workers in the city. The production achievements of most of the loom operators at Yongchang Silk Factory have caught up with the level of Qiu Alan. The third team of the weaving workshop of Hufeng Silk Factory had not been able to complete the plan for a long time. A few days ago, they boosted their enthusiasm and started a competition with the fourth team, which had the highest output in the factory. Since September, their production achievements have exceeded the fourth team. The workers of each factory saw that Dachang Silk Factory had many quality pacesetters and outstanding achievements, so they competed with Dachang workers in both output and quality. At present, 48 workers in Yongchang Silk Factory and Hufeng Silk Factory have caught up with the level of advanced workers of the same variety in Dachang. The Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has strongly led this competition. The county committee appointed a deputy county magistrate, the director of the Light Industry Bureau, and the chairman of the county trade union to be specifically responsible for the competition. They and the leading cadres of each factory formed a competition evaluation committee to evaluate once a month, introduce experiences to each other in the evaluation, and jointly solve the key problems in production, so that this competition can continue to move forward in "one battle, one conclusion, one evaluation, one leap." The county party committee paid great attention to strengthening political and ideological leadership. For example, in order to overcome the thinking of some leading cadres and workers that "they dare not compete with the nationally famous Dachang Factory," the county party committee promptly launched a big debate in each factory on "Do we want to catch up with Dachang? Can we catch up with Dachang? How to catch up with Dachang?" and commended the factories and workers who had changed from backward to advanced in the Great Leap Forward last year, making everyone full of confidence and enthusiastically participating in the competition. In the competition, the county party committee also constantly pointed out that it is necessary to have a comprehensive view of completing the state production plan, to pay special attention to putting politics in command, to vigorously carry out mass movements, to carry out technological innovation, to improve workers' technical level, to strengthen enterprise management, to care about the masses' lives, etc., to ensure the healthy development of the competition.

    高举共产主义协作的火炬开展挂钩竞赛
    湖州五绸厂齐开跃进花
    竞赛中既你追我赶，互相促进，又彼此帮助，通力协作，作到落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进
    本报杭州23日电　浙江省吴兴县湖州市达昌、永昌、湖丰、湖州、戴林等五家绸厂，今年以来，以先进厂达昌绸厂为标兵，开展挂钩竞赛。在竞赛中，各厂职工你追我赶，互相促进，同时充分发扬了共产主义的协作精神，一家有事大家帮，达到了共同提高。这五家绸厂从1月份到8月份，各项生产计划都完成得很好。总产值完成国家计划101.88％，比去年同期增长39.54％；产量比国家计划超额十万六千二百九十米，比去年同期增长51.45％；在质量方面，绸缎正品率达到99.17％，比去年同期增长2.19％。劳动生产率比去年提高了，利润比去年增加了，成本也降低了。
    这五个厂竞赛的突出成绩是：后进赶上先进，先进更加先进。不久前才由丝织生产合作社转为工厂的戴林丝织厂，生产情况原来不大好，在竞赛中经过自己努力，又得到其他厂的帮助，2月份一跃而成先进厂，并获得厂际竞赛红旗。永昌绸厂原先是所谓“比上不足，比下有余”的工厂。竞赛中，这个厂的职工感到不能“安于中游”，急起直追，3月份到5月份生产特别出色，连续获得厂际竞赛红旗。这些厂的成就鼓舞了一贯生产先进的达昌绸厂，职工们干劲更足，6月份各项生产指标都超额完成，绸缎正品率高达99.99％，又一次创造了全国质量新记录，夺回了红旗。
    湖州市五个绸厂的厂际竞赛，是在总结去年大跃进经验的基础上开展起来的。各厂职工学习了党的八届六中全会文件，讨论了去年的伟大成绩和经验，以及今年继续跃进的形势和有利条件，从而普遍提高了认识。在这一基础上，中共吴兴县委召开了丝织工业二千多人的练本领、大比武、选英雄的誓师大会，掀起了生产竞赛热潮。各厂相互挂钩，开展了每月评比一次的红旗竞赛。由于达昌绸厂是全省丝织工业的一面红旗，生产的绸缎质量居全国首位，永昌、湖丰等绸厂便提出了“学达昌、赶达昌”的口号，而达昌绸厂也提出了“大鼓干劲，全面跃进，誓与全国比先进”的口号。
    厂际竞赛开展以后，各厂工人不但关心自己的生产情况，而且密切注意别厂的生产情况和本厂其他工人的生产情况。每个工厂的大门口，每天早上都公布头一天各厂的生产进度和本厂每个工人的生产成绩。工人们一发现高产优质新纪录，就千方百计向这一目标追赶。几个月来，各厂职工通过参观、访问、开现场会、办展览会等方式互相学习。前一时期，永昌绸厂的绸缎生产由于半制品质量不好，正品率不高；而达昌绸厂通过总结生产经验，找出了提高半制品的窍门。永昌绸厂领导方面就组织职工到达昌绸厂学习，结果消灭了由于半制品质量不好而出的次货，使日产量从低于计划二千多米提高到超产二千米以上。湖丰绸厂由总支书记率领一批挡车工、保全工、辅助工、行政管理干部到达昌绸厂去“取经”，学习了从生产到企业管理的许多先进经验，回厂后积极推广，生产面貌大变，产量、质量都有提高。B乔其等绸缎品种的质量赶上了达昌。
    许多先进经验在互相学习中不断得到充实。例如，永昌绸厂学习了达昌绸厂创造的“单锭无牙纡子车”，又结合厂里具体情况作了某些改进，工作效率更有提高；后来达昌绸厂又向永昌绸厂学习，进一步把单锭改为双锭，比永昌的效率还高。这个经过不断改革的“双锭无牙纡子车”便具有着许多优点：车速加快，效率提高，停台减少，避免油渍，节约原材料。又如，湖丰绸厂试验用糯米代替牛皮膏作为浆丝原料，没有成功，但积累了一些经验，后来达昌绸厂学习了湖丰的做法，并作了一些改进，试验成功了，现在各厂已普遍推广这一经验。
    湖州五绸厂挂钩竞赛中的相互帮助和通力协作，采取集体研究、现场会诊、从技术上或设备上进行具体帮助等多种方式。各厂许多生产关键问题在这一协作中得到解决。不久以前，湖州绸厂在生产美丽绸时，出现了一百多匹次品，技术力量较强的达昌绸厂的厂长带着技术员、工人赶来协助进行“现场会诊”。经过检查，发现织绸机上的经轴质量不好，需要改换，达昌厂便主动把自己厂里的经轴借给湖州绸厂，并关照怎样提高操作技术。这样，湖州厂的问题就解决了。永昌绸厂织零七电力纺时质量上出现了一点毛病，这种毛病原先湖丰绸厂也出现过，经过派人到上海的绸厂学习后克服了。这次，湖丰绸厂便把如何消除这种毛病的办法介绍给永昌，帮助永昌提高了产品正品率。
    大立标兵，大抓车间、班组、个人之间的竞赛，使湖州五绸厂的厂际竞赛开展得深入持久。达昌绸厂三年不出次品的挡车工陆祥林，永昌绸厂连续三十多个月无次货的挡车工丘阿兰，湖丰绸厂著名的先进生产者叶阿二等的事迹和经验，都已经在全市丝织工人中广为传播。永昌绸厂绝大部分挡车工的生产成绩，已经赶上丘阿兰的水平。湖丰绸厂织造车间第三小组长期产量完不成计划，前些日子他们鼓足干劲，同全厂产量最高的第四小组展开竞赛，9月份以来，他们的生产成绩超过了第四小组。各厂工人看到达昌绸厂的质量标兵多，成绩突出，就同达昌工人既比产量又比质量。目前，永昌绸厂和湖丰绸厂已有四十八个工人赶上了达昌的同品种先进工人的水平。中共吴兴县委大力领导了这一竞赛。县委指定一个副县长、轻工业局局长、县工会主席具体负责竞赛工作。他们和各厂领导干部成立了竞赛评比委员会，每月评比一次，在评比中互相介绍经验，共同解决生产中的关键问题，使这个竞赛在“一战一结，一结一评，一评一跃”中不断前进。县委很注意加强政治思想领导工作。例如，为了克服某些领导干部和工人“不敢和全国闻名的达昌厂竞赛”的思想，县委及时发动各厂开展了“要不要赶达昌？能不能赶达昌？怎样赶达昌？”的大辩论，并表扬了去年大跃进中由落后变成先进的工厂和工人，使大家充满信心，踊跃投入了竞赛。在竞赛中，县委还不断指出要有全面完成国家生产计划的观点，要特别注意政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，开展技术革新，提高工人技术水平，加强企业管理，关心群众生活等等，保证了竞赛的健康发展。（李新民）
