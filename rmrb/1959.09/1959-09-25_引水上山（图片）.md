Water Diversion Up the Mountain
On Dongliang Mountain in Wushan County, which is 1,900 meters above sea level, a Dongliang Canal was built, with a total length of 60 li. This canal runs from south to north and can irrigate more than 30,000 mu of land. The clear water has driven away the drought that has plagued the area for thousands of years, opening a path to happiness for the people in the mountainous areas. Listen to the mountain song of today: "The silver water flows on Dongliang Mountain, and eating doesn't rely on the Dragon King anymore. The ears of grain are plump and the rice flowers are fragrant, and the barren mountains have become like the Jiangnan region." Left picture: A glimpse of the Dongliang Canal. Right picture: Mechanized farming operations, which have never been seen before, have begun on Dongliang Mountain. Xinhua News Agency reporter Hao Changgeng took the picture.

    引水上山
    武山县海拔一千九百米的东梁山上，修了一条全长六十华里的东梁渠。这条渠由南往北，可浇地三万多亩，清清的流水赶走了为害几千年的干旱，给山区人民打开了通向幸福的道路。请听听今天的山歌吧：“东梁山银水淌，吃饭不靠老龙王。谷穗肥胖稻花香，荒山变成江南样”。　左图：东梁渠一瞥　右图：东梁山上开始了从来没有过的机耕作业。　新华社记者　郝常耕摄
