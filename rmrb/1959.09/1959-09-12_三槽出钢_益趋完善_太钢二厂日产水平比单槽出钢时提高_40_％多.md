    "Three-Trough Steel Tapping" Increasingly Perfected
    Taiyuan Iron and Steel No. 2 Plant's Daily Output Increased by More Than 40% Compared to Single-Trough Steel Tapping

    Taiyuan, September 11 (reported by this newspaper) – The workers of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, who pioneered the three-trough steel tapping method last year, continued to carry out a large-scale technical innovation movement this year, solving new problems after the comprehensive promotion of this new technology, resulting in a steady increase in steel production and major changes in the plant's production landscape.

    Three-trough steel tapping was a major technical innovation during the Great Leap Forward last year at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. This revolutionary initiative significantly increased the output of each furnace of steel compared to double-trough and single-trough steel tapping. The plant comprehensively adopted this new technology in the fourth quarter of last year, and the average output of each furnace of steel surged by 88.1% compared to January-August of last year. From January to August of this year, the plant's Party committee launched a technical innovation movement among workers, continuously solving new problems brought about by three-trough steel tapping. Without increasing equipment, the average output of each furnace of steel increased by 2.7% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, the plant's daily steel output increased by more than 40% compared to single-trough steel tapping. This year, the plant's output of high-quality steel also increased by more than 18% compared to single-trough steel tapping last year.

    Since the beginning of this year, workers have put forward no less than a hundred innovation proposals, and forty-three major innovations have been applied to production, continuously solving new problems brought to production after the implementation of three-trough steel tapping. After the comprehensive adoption of the three-trough steel tapping method, the charging volume increased, and there was also more slag. Slag needed to be removed as quickly as possible to reduce gas consumption and further shorten smelting time; with more steel being tapped, it was necessary to accurately control the flow of molten steel and promptly cast it. However, manual slag removal and manual control of the steel diversion rudder could not meet the requirements of three-trough steel tapping. Workers in the Li Naizheng electrician group of Class C boldly created an electric slag remover and a steel diversion rudder, saving manpower and accurately controlling the molten steel. Subsequently, the Jia Yingui electrician group of Class B successfully tested a rapid speed change mechanism for the crane, which increased the speed of the ladle and shortened the casting time of molten steel. Steel spills and leaks had been a major critical problem affecting the promotion of three-trough steel tapping. Veteran worker Jiao Qinghu created a movable steel casting support, which changed the phenomenon of steel spills that occurred due to the inability to adjust the original steel casting frame. This further perfected the three-trough steel tapping method, produced good results in increasing output and quality, and reducing workers' labor intensity, further demonstrating the power of this new technology.

    Recently, the plant's workers enthusiastically discussed the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, decided to revise the production plan, and strive to increase steel output in September by 20% compared to August, and to overfulfill the third quarter steel production plan by two thousand tons.

    “三槽出钢”  益趋完善
    太钢二厂日产水平比单槽出钢时提高40％多
    本报太原11日电　去年首创三槽出钢法的太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂职工，今年继续大搞技术革新运动，解决了全面推广这项新技术以后的新问题，使钢产量节节上升，全厂生产面貌发生了重大变化。
    三槽出钢，是太原钢铁公司去年大跃进中的一项重大技术革新。这一革命性的创举，使每炉钢的产量比双槽出钢和单槽出钢都大大提高。这个厂在去年第四季度全面采用这一新技术，每炉钢的平均产量比去年1至8月份猛增了88.1％。今年1至8月，厂党委又发动工人开展技术革新运动，不断解决了三槽出钢以后带来的新问题，在没有增加设备的条件下，每炉钢的平均产量又比去年第四季度提高了2.7％。这样，就使全厂钢的日产水平比单槽出钢时提高了40％以上。今年，这个厂优质钢的产量也较去年单槽出钢时提高了18％以上。
    今年以来，工人们提出的革新建议不下百余条，已用于生产中的重大革新有四十三项，不断地解决了推行三槽出钢以后给生产带来的新问题。全面采用三槽出钢法以后，装炉量增加，渣子也多了，需要尽快清渣，才能减少煤气消耗，进一步缩短冶炼时间；钢出多了，需要准确地控制钢水流量，及时浇铸。但是，人工扒渣和人工控制分钢舵，不能适应三槽出钢的要求。丙班李乃正电工小组工人就大胆创造了电动扒渣机和分钢舵，节省了人力，准确地控制了钢水。接着，乙班贾银贵电工小组又试验成功天车快速变速机，提高了吊罐的速度，缩短了钢水的浇铸时间。跑钢漏钢，曾是推行三槽出钢后影响较大的关键问题。老工人焦庆虎创造的活动铸钢支架，改变了原来因铸钢架不能调整而发生跑钢的现象。这样，就使三槽出钢法又进一步趋于完善，对提高产量、质量和减轻工人劳动强度产生了良好的效果，进一步发挥了这一新技术的威力。
    最近，这个厂的工人热烈讨论了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议，决定修改生产计划，力争9月份的钢产量比8月份提高20％，超额二千吨完成第三季度钢产计划。
