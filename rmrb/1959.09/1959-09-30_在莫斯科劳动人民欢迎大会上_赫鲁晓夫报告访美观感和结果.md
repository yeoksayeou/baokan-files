Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 28th: A mass rally was held by the working people of Moscow and the Moscow region on September 28th at the Lenin Central Stadium to welcome the return of Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, from his visit to the United States.

The mass rally began under the chairmanship of Ustinov, First Secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee.

Khrushchev delivered a speech at the rally. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear Comrades!

We have just stepped off the plane, which has completed a non-stop flight from Washington to Moscow (applause). Dear Muscovites, we are immediately joining your rally in order to share some of our impressions and talk about the results of our visit to the United States at the invitation of U.S. President Eisenhower.

Our starting point in accepting this invitation was that the international situation and the relations between our two great powers—the Soviet Union and the United States—have long been in a state of tension. Maintaining this state is tantamount to maintaining a situation where unexpected events could occur that would bring serious consequences to the people of our two countries and the people of the world. Therefore, some of the most far-sighted leaders in many countries have fully realized that efforts must be made to end the "Cold War," eliminate tension in international relations, improve the atmosphere, and establish more normal international relations. Then, the people of all countries can live in peace of mind without worrying about their fate and look forward to the future.

In the case of countries with different social systems, international problems can only be successfully resolved on the basis of peaceful coexistence. There is no other way out.

The twentieth century is a century of extremely developed human wisdom and genius. In our time, people are using their own hands to realize the ideals that mankind has dreamed of for generations. In the past, people used to weave these ideals into myths, considering them unattainable fantasies. But now, in such a vigorous era when human genius can unravel the mysteries of nature and master its immense power, can we allow the primitive relations between people when they were still beasts to be preserved?

If it were in ancient times, this relationship could be explained by the fact that humans were in the early stages of development and not much different from animals. But now, in an era when scientific knowledge has achieved unprecedented prosperity and is gradually and increasingly conquering nature to benefit society, there is no reason to maintain the relationship between primitive people.

Our era can and should be an era of realizing great ideals, an era of peace and progress (sustained applause).

The Soviet government has long recognized this. That is why we have repeatedly suggested that the major powers arrange a summit meeting to exchange views on mature international issues. When we made this proposal, we believed in human reason. We believe that representatives holding different political views, representatives of countries with different social systems, can find a common language as long as they adopt a wise attitude, and correctly solve the current problems that concern all mankind in order to consolidate peace. In our century of great technological development, international problems can only be successfully resolved on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence in the case of countries with different social systems. There is no other way out. Those who say they do not understand what peaceful coexistence is and are afraid of peaceful coexistence are intentionally or unintentionally contributing to the further development of the "Cold War." If we do not intervene and do not eliminate the "Cold War," it will inevitably expand. It can reach such a state of white heat that at any time, a single spark is enough to ignite a world war. In this war, many things will be destroyed. When terrible destructive weapons such as atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and ballistic missiles begin to speak, it will be too late to discuss what peaceful coexistence is. Ballistic missiles can virtually deliver nuclear weapons to any point on the globe without being noticed. Not taking this into account is tantamount to closing your eyes, plugging your ears, and hiding your head like an ostrich when faced with danger. If we humans also bury our heads in the sand like ostriches, then what is the point of having a human head if it cannot prevent threats to its own life? (Sustained applause).

No, we should show human reason, show confidence in this reason, and believe that it is possible to reach agreements with the leaders of various countries and work together to mobilize people to avoid the threat of war. There must be perseverance and courage to stop the diehards from continuing the "Cold War." The road to the "Cold War" must be blocked, the ice must be melted, and international relations must be normalized.

From this lofty platform, in front of the people of Moscow, in front of all the people, the government, and the Party, I must say that President Eisenhower's assessment of the current international situation shows the wisdom of a national leader, and shows courage and perseverance (stormy applause).

Despite the complex environment in the United States today, he, as a person who enjoys the absolute trust of his people, put forward the proposal for mutual visits between the heads of government of our two countries. We give due importance to this important initiative aimed at strengthening the cause of peace (sustained applause). He was convinced when he took this step that we would shake his outstretched hand, because we have raised this issue with President Eisenhower and other heads of government more than once. The U.S. President's calculation was not wrong (applause).

Dear Comrades, I am very pleased to report to you that we have completed a part of the agreement reached with President Eisenhower on mutual visits. We accepted the President's kind invitation and completed our visit to the United States. We had important meetings and conversations there.

One visit is not enough to solve very important problems. To solve these problems, great efforts must be made.

I would like to talk about my impressions of this visit and briefly talk about the results of the visit.

I think it is best to talk about the original situation as it is. The more realistically we talk, the better it will be for consolidating relations between our two countries (applause). It would be untrue if I said that after visiting some American cities, meeting and talking with many Americans, the disputed issues were resolved. Only a political blind person would think that things will happen the way he says.

No, one visit, one trip, is not enough to solve very important problems, and great efforts must be made to solve these problems. Many more meetings will have to be held in the future in order to achieve complete mutual understanding, in order to achieve the goal that our Party, our people, and our Soviet state have always strived for—to ensure peaceful coexistence between countries with different social structures and to ensure the safety of the people of all countries on the basis of non-interference in internal affairs.

I would like to talk about our mood when we first set foot on American soil.

Frankly speaking, my mood was complicated. This is because when the news of the mutual visits was announced, many American newspapers and certain individuals began to conduct propaganda against my visit to the United States. They created a climate that did not make me feel warm, although the temperature in the United States was much higher than in Moscow. They wanted to treat me with indifference. What I found particularly unpleasant was that when I was flying from Moscow to Washington, I read a speech made by Vice President Nixon precisely at the time of my visit. It seems that the audience he chose was one that could not be doubted as warmongers in any way. This was the Association of Dental Surgeons (lively in the hall). But Mr. Nixon's speech was far from being of any medical significance (laughter in the hall). He added cold air to toothaches, so to speak. It seems that he was afraid that things would really ease up, that the "Cold War" would really end. I don't understand why he did this.

However, when we arrived in Washington, we received the reception that our great country and our great people deserved (stormy and sustained applause). President Eisenhower must be given due credit: he did everything that was needed to organize this high-level meeting (applause). You have obviously seen in the newspapers how we were welcomed in the American capital and what kind of speech the President delivered. I am not going to repeat it. It was a cordial meeting.

After arriving in Washington, we immediately met with the President at the White House. Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Herter were present at the meeting. I am an impatient person, a straightforward person, and although this may not be entirely in line with diplomatic etiquette, I asked in the first conversation why the Vice President had delivered such a speech on the eve of my arrival. I will not talk about some unfriendly remarks and articles published by lower-level people.

The President said that he had not read Nixon's speech. So I said that it was not worth reading the speech because it was already a thing of the past (applause).

This is to some extent an illustration of the characteristics of the preparation for receiving overseas guests (lively in the hall).

As soon as you set foot on American soil, you are under strict guard, so that you have no chance to contact ordinary people. The situation only changed through diplomatic negotiations.

Secondly, you Muscovites, and not only you, all Soviet people—Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Uzbeks, Georgians, Kazakhs, Armenians—people of all nationalities always welcome guests very well. No matter what country the guest represents, no matter what his political beliefs are, since he is our guest, we treat him with hospitality and respect him not only outwardly but also from the bottom of our hearts (applause). But in the United States, I saw such a scene on the first day: we were walking with the President; many people were standing, and someone raised his hand and waved, but I saw that the hand quickly retracted, as if it had been shocked (laughter).

At first, I didn't understand what was going on. So I decided to take a closer look at the faces of the people standing on both sides of our road. I nodded slightly to greet them, and many people began to respond to me with the same movement. What was going on?

Later, someone told me that ten minutes before I and the President drove to the White House, a car had driven along the route we were taking. This car had a sign on it that read: Welcome the guests fully and politely, but do not applaud or greet them (lively in the hall).

Later, I asked Mr. Lodge, the President's representative who accompanied me on my visit to various parts of the United States: Is this true? The explanation I received was that a car with such a sign had indeed driven by. However, no one knows who this car belongs to, it is said (laughter in the hall). It is said that this car crossed the police cordon. When the officials explained this to me, I said to them that I found it hard to imagine that the police who guarded me so meticulously had not discovered a car with such a sign (lively in the hall).

I am sure that the President did not know all this, and all this was not only against the President's wishes, but also against the wishes of others who organized our welcome. However, as the saying goes, the lyrics cannot be deleted.

As soon as I set foot on American soil, I was surrounded by strict guards, so that I had no chance to contact American ordinary people. This guard became a disguised house arrest (lively in the hall). They put me in a tightly closed car, and I could only see the people who welcomed us from the window. People welcomed me, although they often couldn't see me.

I never thought that the friendly feelings shown by the American people were entirely for me personally or even for our communist ideology. This welcome shown by the American people showed that they, like us, advocate fighting for peace and the friendship of our two peoples (stormy applause).

I do not intend to talk in detail about our various meetings with the Americans; you have obviously learned about them from the newspapers. We visited Washington, and then we visited New York. On the podium of the United Nations in New York, I had the honor to represent the Soviet government in proposing a proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. (Stormy applause).

From New York, we went to Los Angeles and San Francisco on the West Coast of the United States, and then to Iowa and Pittsburgh, a large industrial center in Pennsylvania. Finally, we returned to Washington. This was a not short journey: we visited various regions of the United States and met all kinds of people. There were many good meetings and frank conversations. But there were also meetings of a different nature.

In the first half of our journey, we saw some people repeating the same set of words like playing a record. The speaker insisted that I had once said that we "will bury the capitalists." At first, I patiently explained that what I said was that we "will bury capitalism," meaning that socialism will inevitably replace this dying social form, just as capitalism once replaced feudalism. Later, I found that those who stubbornly repeated such questions did not need your explanation at all. They have a clear purpose: to scare those who are very vague about the concept of communism and do not understand what communism is with communism.

At a reception in Los Angeles, the mayor started talking in this manner again. This mayor was no worse than other mayors, but perhaps he was less diplomatic. I had to express my attitude towards this situation at that time.

I said, are you trying to organize hostile demonstrations against me in every city and at every meeting? If you treat me like this, then okay, there is a Russian saying: "It is not difficult to turn away from someone else's door" (applause). If you are not fully prepared to negotiate, if you have not realized that the "Cold War" must be eliminated and are afraid of eliminating the Cold War, and want to continue it, then we are not in a hurry, we can be patient. We have enough patience and enough wisdom. The situation in our country is very good. Our people have shown reason, strength, and will more than once, and have shown that they are very good at overcoming difficulties: they can defend their motherland and defend the cause of peace (sustained applause). If the aggressive forces try to test us with bayonets, the people can give them the due counterattack (applause).

I had to enter diplomatic negotiations at that time. I asked Comrade Gromyko, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to tell Mr. Lodge, the special representative of the President who accompanied me, that if the situation did not change, I thought it would be impossible to continue the visit, and I would return to Washington, and then from Washington back to Moscow.

It seems that all this worked. Mr. Lodge told me through Comrade Gromyko that he suggested continuing the visit to San Francisco and other cities as planned. He said that the local authorities would take measures to prevent this situation from happening again.

It should be said that this negotiation through Comrade Gromyko was in the evening, and when I woke up the next morning, everything had indeed changed. When we went from Los Angeles to San Francisco, I felt as if my "handcuffs" had been removed, and I had the opportunity to get out of the car and meet people (applause). People shook hands with me, and I shook hands with them. They applauded and smiled, just like you Muscovites smiled to welcome guests, to make guests happy, and to do everything possible to make guests feel that they are being well received (applause).

The Soviet delegation was warmly welcomed by the residents of San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and other places. The workers expressed their respects to the Soviet representatives with enthusiasm.

When we arrived in San Francisco, the sun was shining and as beautiful as our summer. The climate in this beautiful city is completely different, the sunshine warms us, but the warm and unconstrained welcome warms us even more (applause).

We want to especially thank Mr. Christopher, the Mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Brown, the Governor of California, the citizens of San Francisco, and all those who understand this visit—a visit to promote peace and friendship between the peoples of our two countries and the people of all countries in the world (applause).

We were given every opportunity to meet and talk with ordinary people. Indeed, we were already too busy to meet and talk with people at that time, but all this was due to the short duration of our visit. To be honest, the idea of doubting the ill intentions of the local authorities disappeared. We quickly established good contact with the residents of this beautiful city.

I would particularly like to point out the meeting with the dockworkers. Mr. Bridges, the leader of the Pacific Coast Dockworkers Union, invited me and my comrades to talk with the dockworkers. It was a cordial meeting. I felt like I was with Soviet workers when I was with these simple and sincere dockworkers (applause). I conveyed my greetings to them on behalf of the Soviet workers, and I was warmly welcomed by them. They also asked me to convey their warm respects (stormy applause).

I also recall the scene of visiting the computer manufacturing plant in San Jose City near San Francisco. Mr. Watson, the factory director, and the factory staff welcomed us warmly and introduced us to the complex production process in Russian in detail. It was particularly gratifying that they were so well prepared. This factory, the factory structure, and the organization of production left us with a good impression.

I found that one of the commentators had a Ukrainian accent, so I asked him:

May I ask your surname? (lively in the hall) (Translator's note: Khrushchev asked the following question in Ukrainian)

He replied:

——Marchenko.

I said:

——I greet you. Are your parents still alive?

He replied:

——Yes, they are.

——Please send my regards to your parents.

He thanked me (lively in the hall).

However, the term of the visit to hospitable San Francisco was over, and we had to fly to another city in the United States—Des Moines, Iowa. This is one of the most important centers of agricultural production in the United States.

After warmly meeting with the governor, the mayor, and representatives of business, industrial and social organizations, we went to the cornfield in the suburbs that I loved so much (lively in the hall, applause). It should be said that the Americans are very good at growing corn, growing it in squares, and the land is well cleaned up. It is true that I also discovered some shortcomings of Gaster, an old hand in corn planting and an old acquaintance of mine (laughter, applause), and the corn was planted too densely. Of course, I friendly reminded him of this.

We were warmly received by our host, Mr. Gaster, who arranged interesting meetings with farmers for us. There, we met Stevenson, a well-known Democratic activist from Chicago, and had a very frank and friendly conversation with him.

I remember such an episode. When we went to a university, a young man handed me a student newspaper with a long article published on it. The translator told me that the college students expressed their welcome to our visit in the article. However, the article said that the students would not be enthusiastic or cheer for our welcome. But what was the result? These students (in whose name the article was written) are energetic young people, and they showed the enthusiasm that our youth showed. They cheered, applauded, and enthusiastically expressed their feelings. Only the following voices were heard: "Comrade Khrushchev!", "Nikita" and other sincere and enthusiastic words (lively, applause).

I should also tell you about the warm welcome we received from the residents in Pittsburgh, one of the largest industrial cities in the United States—a city of metallurgy and machinery manufacturing. They showed extreme friendliness and respect to us. When I was driving from the airport to the city, I even felt a little embarrassed. We arrived in Pittsburgh at twelve o'clock at night. It was a dark night. However, when we entered the urban area, there were cars parked along the road and many people standing. I saw them smiling and heard them cheering.

We visited the machine manufacturing plant of "Mesta" company in Pittsburgh.

We felt that the management of the factory tried its best to let us understand this enterprise and made it possible for us to understand the working conditions. We visited all parts of the factory and talked with the workers. I would like to point out a characteristic: when we walked in, everyone welcomed us, but very implicitly. But the closer we got to the workers, the more cordial the meeting was, and the workers expressed their respect for us—representatives of the Soviet state and the Soviet people—with enthusiasm.

The meeting with the Pittsburgh business community and intellectuals also left a deep impression. This meeting was held at a local university. A banquet was held in Pittsburgh as usual, and everyone spoke at the banquet. In my opinion, the characteristics of these speeches showed a more realistic understanding of the necessity of establishing friendly relations between our two countries.

There are many good things, but don't forget the bad things. In the United States, there is a force that opposes us, opposes the easing of tension, and advocates maintaining the "Cold War."

After listening to my speech, some people may think that Khrushchev only talked about friendly meetings and concealed the hostile demonstrations. No, I am not prepared to not mention the fact that some people have taken a hostile or unfriendly attitude towards us. Yes, this kind of thing happened. As everyone knows, during my visit to the United States, American journalists were my travel companions, and fascist exiles from various countries also traveled from one city to another, bringing out some poor signs. We encountered some fierce American faces and some gloomy American faces.

There are many good things, but don't forget the bad things. This maggot, or rather, these despicable maggots are still alive and will continue to stir in the future.

Why do I say this? Is it to cool down Soviet-US relations? No. The reason I say this is because we must understand the true situation, so that you can not only see the side that pleases us, but also see the other, backstage side, which does not need to be concealed. In the United States, there is a force that opposes us, opposes the easing of tension, and advocates maintaining the "Cold War." Closing your eyes and not seeing this is tantamount to showing weakness in the struggle against evil forces and against demons. No, they must be exposed, they must be exposed, they must be openly whipped, and they must be fried like demons in a frying pan (laughter, sustained applause) to let those who intend to continue the "Cold War" get angry and jump! Ordinary people on earth do not support them, and people with human reason do not support them.

After visiting Pittsburgh, our trip to various parts of the United States ended.

At the end of the introduction to the trip to the United States, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the mayors and governors of the cities and states we have visited, representatives of the business and intellectual circles, all the staff of enterprises and schools, workers and farmers, and representatives of all social organizations. I would like to especially point out the great work done by Mr. Wagner, the Mayor of New York City, Mr. Christopher, the Mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Gallagher, the Mayor of Pittsburgh, Mr. Lawrence, the Governor of Pennsylvania, Mr. Litchfield, the President of the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Hilton, the President of the University of Iowa, business people Johnston, Taurin, Eaton, Watson, Meister, and Gaster.

Countless gifts are the best expression of respect for our country and our great people. The mayors of New York and Pittsburgh have given us symbolic keys of the city as souvenirs.

By the way, I said to them at that time that I accepted these keys as a symbol of trust. You can rest assured, I guarantee to you, that I will never use these keys without the permission of the owner (sustained applause).

"International Harvester Company" gave us a film introducing the mechanization of corn farming, President Eisenhower gave us a high-quality heifer from his private farm, Admiral Strauss gave a bull calf and a heifer, and farmer Currant gave a high-quality boar. There were many other gifts, for which we express our gratitude and thanks (applause).

I would like to point out that American newspapers, radio stations, and television stations have widely, basically correctly, and objectively reported our visit to the United States. Of course, there are also individual reporters who have made unfriendly attacks, but they are not the main theme of American newspapers.

During the visit to the United States, Mr. Lodge, the President's personal representative, Mr. Buchanan, the director of the Office of Protocol of the U.S. State Department, Mr. Thompson, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and their wives, and other officials accompanied me and my comrades, and I should thank them, especially Mr. Lodge. He did everything possible to create the necessary conditions for our visit, and strived to make us understand the life of the great American people (applause).

I jokingly said to Mr. Lodge that if fate throws me—a representative of the working class and the Soviet Communist Party—and him—a representative of the capitalist world—on a desert island, then it seems that we will find a common language and ensure peaceful coexistence on this island (lively in the hall. Sustained applause). But why can't countries with different social systems ensure coexistence? Our country is also like on an island. Because in the current situation where there are modern means of transportation that have shortened the distance between continents, our earth is indeed like a small island, and we must recognize this. After recognizing the need for coexistence, we must implement a policy of peace, get along with each other in a friendly manner, not wielding knives and guns, but destroying weapons (applause).

The heads of state of the Soviet Union and the United States held frank and friendly talks. All those who care about consolidating peace will undoubtedly welcome the joint communiqué of the talks.

Comrades! On September 25th, I met with the U.S. President again at the White House, and then took a helicopter with him to his suburban residence, Camp David. We spent those three days of September 25th, 26th, and 27th there. We held frank and friendly talks, and each explained the positions of our respective governments on the most important international issues and on improving Soviet-US relations. U.S. Secretary of State Herter, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, and some other comrades who accompanied me participated in these meetings and talks, and did useful work.

The main results of my exchange of views with the President have been published in the joint communiqué published in the newspapers today. There is no doubt that all those who care about consolidating peace will welcome this document (sustained applause).

However, it should be taken into account that I naturally could not, with just the two of us, sweep away the accumulation of the "Cold War" over the years. It takes time to clean up this pile of garbage—not only to clean it up, but also to completely eliminate it. Some phenomena that separate us still exist. Some people often find it difficult to get rid of old positions, old views, and old formulas.

However, I can tell you very frankly, dear comrades! After holding talks and discussing specific issues with the U.S. President, I got the impression that he truly hopes to eliminate the "Cold War" state, establish normal relations between our two countries, and promote the improvement of relations between countries (stormy applause). Peace is now indivisible, and the efforts of only two or three countries cannot guarantee peace. Therefore, the struggle for peace must be participated in by the people of all countries and all countries.

I exchanged views with the U.S. President on the issue of disarmament. He said that the U.S. government is studying our proposal, and the U.S., like us, is willing to completely disarm and implement supervision.

It seems that we have no reason to delay the resolution of this issue now. However, on the other hand, the issue of disarmament is a very serious issue, and we cannot ask the other party to resolve this issue quickly all at once. This issue certainly needs to be studied in order to find a solution that can truly build trust, ensure disarmament, and ensure international peaceful coexistence.

Therefore, let us not rush to express our opinions now, let us be patient and give the national leaders time to study our proposals. However, we will not be idle, we will prove that complete and thorough disarmament must be implemented (applause). We believe that our proposal is the basis for reaching an agreement. We are willing to discuss all the amendments proposed to our documents and our proposals. If someone proposes another proposal, and the purpose to be achieved by the proposal is the same as the purpose we are pursuing, we are also willing to discuss it.

We exchanged views with the President on the German issue and the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. We have tried to prove—and I think we have achieved this goal—that the West has misinterpreted our proposal to conclude a peace treaty. Some people have tried their best to stir up unnecessary excitement, insisting that this is an ultimatum, etc. People who act like this clearly want to continue the "Cold War" state. They even said that our proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany is almost a declaration of war. How despicable it is to distort the Soviet Union's peaceful stance like this.

We also exchanged views on the issue of a summit meeting. President Eisenhower and I explained the positions of our two governments and agreed that such a meeting is necessary and beneficial.

We also exchanged views with the U.S. President on the date of his return visit to the Soviet Union. Initially, the President planned to visit the Soviet Union at the end of October this year. But he asked me what season would be best to visit our country. I thought about it. We Muscovites love Moscow in all seasons. But for us and for everyone, the most pleasant time is spring, which embodies joy and happiness, and embodies the lively awakening of life with blooming flowers. Therefore, I said that I think it is best to visit at the end of May or the beginning of June. It is best for the President to bring his wife, son and daughter-in-law, and grandchildren with him. We are also happy to see the President's brother, who visited our country with Mr. Nixon.

The President kindly invited me to his farm. He let me see the corn he grew—I could not not look at his corn since I came to the President's place (lively in the hall). I saw that the calves on Eisenhower's farm were really good livestock. However, considering this vast country, I would say that this farm is not very large for the President. It is not a very wealthy farm, and the land there is not very good. But the President said that he wanted to try to improve the soil, so as to leave a good memory of him.

I met the President's grandchildren on the farm and held a meeting with them (laughter in the hall). I asked them if they wanted to go to Russia. The children, big and small, said in unison that they wanted to go to Russia and to Moscow. The eldest grandson is eleven years old and the youngest is three or four years old. I got their support in advance. I jokingly said to the President that it was easier for me to reach an agreement with his grandchildren on the issue of return visits than with himself (laughter in the hall, applause), because the grandchildren have a good environment, and he probably has some obstacles, so he cannot realize his wishes as he wishes and at the time he wishes (applause).

Dear Comrades, I want to tell you that I have no doubt that the President is willing to use his will and strength to reach an agreement between our two countries, establish friendly relations between our two peoples, and resolve mature issues in order to consolidate peace (applause).

Those who want to maintain the "Cold War" should know that in our time, madmen who want to provoke a war will surely be burned to death in the flames of war.

But I have the impression that there is a force in the United States whose actions are inconsistent with the President's. This force insists on continuing the "Cold War" and the arms race. I am not in a hurry to make a final answer to these questions: Is this force large or small; is the influence large or small; will it defeat the force that supports the President—the vast majority of the American people support him.

Time is a good witness, just as the Russians say: "The morning is wiser than the evening." This is well said. Let us wait for the morning, especially since we flew back at dusk, and it is already evening when I speak. We must understand this well, and it may take more than one morning. However, we will not sit idly by waiting for dawn, waiting for the pointer of international relations to turn in that direction.

However, we will also do everything possible to ensure that the pointer of the barometer does not point to "stormy," nor to "changeable," but to "sunny" (long applause).

Comrades, I believe that under the current conditions, when the forces of peace have grown incredibly stronger, when the socialist camp has nearly one billion people and has huge production capacity, and when the Soviet Union's industry, agriculture, science, technology, and culture are booming, we can do many things that are beneficial to peace.

Our actions are based on wise, truthful foundations, and are supported by all the people. In addition, we are backed by our strong potential. Let those who want to maintain the "Cold War" state, so as to turn the "Cold War" into a "hot war" sooner or later, know that in our time only madmen will provoke a war, and they themselves will surely be burned to death in the flames of war (applause).

The people should put these madmen in straitjackets. We believe that the wisdom of the country and the reason of mankind will surely win (applause). In the words of a famous saying by Pushkin: "Long live reason, darkness disappears!" (Sustained applause).

Dear Moscow comrades! We have returned to the motherland and seen the faces of our dear Soviet people, and we feel infinite happiness (applause).

Long live the great Soviet people who are victoriously building communism under the leadership of the glorious Party of Lenin! (Sustained applause).

Long live Soviet-US friendship! (Sustained applause).

Long live the friendship of the people of all countries in the world! (Stormy, sustained applause, everyone stands up).

    在莫斯科劳动人民欢迎大会上
    赫鲁晓夫报告访美观感和结果
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科28日讯：莫斯科市和莫斯科州的劳动人民28日在列宁中央运动场举行群众大会，欢迎苏联共产党中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访美归来。
    群众大会在莫斯科市党委第一书记乌斯季诺夫主持下开始。
    赫鲁晓夫在大会上讲了话。讲话全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们！
    我们刚刚下飞机，这架飞机完成了从华盛顿到莫斯科的不着陆飞行（掌声）。亲爱的莫斯科市民们，我们马上就来参加你们的大会，为的是向你们介绍一些观感和谈一谈我们这次应美国总统艾森豪威尔的邀请去访问美国的结果。
    我们接受这一邀请的出发点是，国际局势和我们这两个大国——苏联和美国的关系早已处于紧张状态之中，继续保持这种状态，就等于保持这样一种局面：可能发生会给我们两国人民和全世界各国人民带来严重后果的种种意外。所以，许多国家的一些最有远见的领导人都充分了解到，必须努力来结束“冷战”，消除国际关系中的紧张状态，改善气氛，以及建立比较正常的国际关系。到那时，各国人民就可以不必为自己的命运担心而安心地生活下去并瞻望将来。
    在存在着不同社会制度的国家的情况下，只有在和平共处的基础上才能顺利地解决国际问题。别的出路是没有的。
  二十世纪是人的智慧和天才极其发达的一个世纪。在我们这个时代，人们在用自己的双手实现人类世世代代梦寐以求的理想。过去人们曾经把这种理想编成神话，认为这是不可实现的幻想。而在现在这样一个人类的天才能揭破自然的奥秘，并且掌握自然的巨大力量的旺盛时代，难道能够容许保留当人还是野兽时人们之间的原始关系吗？
    如果是在远古时代，这种关系可以解释为：人处在初级发展阶段，同动物没多大差别。而在现在，当人取得了科学知识的空前繁荣、并且正在逐步日益广泛征服自然、使它造福于社会的时代，如果再保持原始人之间的那种关系，那就毫无理由了。
    我们的时代能够而且应当成为实现伟大理想的时代，成为和平和进步的时代（经久不息的掌声）。
    苏联政府早就意识到这一点。正因为如此，我们才屡次建议大国安排政府首脑会议，来就成熟了的国际问题交换意见。当我们提出这项建议的时候，我们是相信人的理智的。我们相信，持有不同政治观点的代表，不同社会制度的国家的代表，只要抱着明智的态度，就可以找到共同的语言，正确地解决全人类所关心的当前的问题，以利于巩固和平。在我们这个技术获得伟大发展的世纪，在存在着不同社会制度的国家的情况下，只有在和平共处的原则的基础上才能顺利地解决国际问题。别的出路是没有的。那些说他们不懂和平共处为何物，并且害怕和平共处的人正在有意或无意地助长“冷战”的进一步发展，如果我们不干预也不来消除“冷战”的话，那它就一定会扩大起来。它可以达到这种白热化的程度，以至在任何时候只要燃起一星火花，就足以引起一场世界战火。在这场战争中许多东西都要毁灭。当原子弹、氢弹、弹道火箭这些可怕的毁灭性武器开始讲话的时候，再来讨论和平共处为何物，那就晚了。弹道火箭实际上可以不知不觉地把核武器送到地球上的任何一点。不考虑到这一点，就等于闭起眼睛，堵起耳朵，像鸵鸟碰到危险一样，把头藏起来。如果我们人类也像鸵鸟那样，把头藏在沙子里，那么人的头既然不能防止对自己生命的威胁，要它干吗？（经久不息的掌声）。
    不，我们应该表现出人类的理智，表现出对这种理智的信心，相信有可能同各国领导人达成协议，共同努力动员人们，以免除战争危险的威胁。必须有毅力和勇气来制止顽固不化的人继续搞“冷战”。必须堵塞“冷战”的道路，融化冰块，使国际关系正常化。
    在这个崇高的讲坛上，在莫斯科人、在全体人民、政府和党的面前，我应当说，美国总统艾森豪威尔对当前国际局势的估计表现了一个国家领导人的明智，表现了勇气和毅力（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    尽管美国当前的环境很复杂，但是，他作为得到本国人民绝对信任的人，提出了我们两国政府首脑互相访问的建议。我们对这个目的在于加强和平事业的重要倡议给予应有的重视（经久不息的掌声）。他采取这个步骤的时候深信，我们会握他伸出来的手，因为我们曾经不止一次地向艾森豪威尔总统和其他国家政府首脑提出过这个问题。美国总统的盘算并没有错误（鼓掌）。
    亲爱的同志们，我很满意地向你们报告，我们完成了同艾森豪威尔总统达成的关于互访协议的一部分。我们接受总统的盛情邀请，完成了在美国的访问。我们在那里进行了重要的会见和交谈。
    要解决十分重大的问题，一次访问是不够的。要解决这些问题，必须作巨大的努力。
    我想谈谈这次访问的观感，简要地谈谈访问的结果。
    我想，最好是原来情况是怎样就怎样谈。我们越是实实在在地谈，对巩固我们两国之间的关系越有好处（掌声）。如果我说，我们在走访了一些美国城市之后，同许多美国人会见和交谈之后，争执问题就解决了，那是不真实的。只有政治盲人才会认为，他怎么说，事情就怎么发生。
    不，要解决十分重大的问题，一次访问，一次旅行是不够的，要解决这些问题，必须作巨大的努力。今后还得举行不少的会晤，才能求得完全的相互了解，才能达到我们党、我们人民、我们苏维埃国家所一向努力的目标——保证各个不同社会结构的国家之间的和平共处和在不干涉内政的基础上保证各国人民的安全。
    我想谈一谈，当我们第一次踏上美国领土时我们的心情。
    我坦率地说，我的心情是错综复杂的。这是因为，当关于将互相访问的消息一发表时，美国许多报刊和某些人士就开始进行宣传，反对我到美国去访问。他们创造了一种气候，使我感不到暖和，虽然美国的温度比莫斯科高得多。他们想用冷淡的态度对待我。我特别感到不愉快的是，当我乘飞机从莫斯科前往华盛顿时，读到尼克松副总统恰恰在我去访问的时候发表的讲话。他选择的听众，看来，是无论如何也不能怀疑他们好战的。这是牙科医生协会（场内活跃）。但是尼克松先生的讲话却远没有什么医疗意义（场内笑声）。他给牙病可以说加添了冷气。看来，他唯恐真的缓和起来，唯恐“冷战”真的结束。我不懂，为什么要这样干。
    但是，当我们飞抵华盛顿时，我们受到我们伟大国家、我们伟大人民所应该得到的接待（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）。必须对艾森豪威尔总统给予应有的评价：他作了组织这次高级会晤时所需要作的一切（掌声）。你们显然在报上已经看到，我们在美国首都受到怎样的欢迎，总统发表了怎样的演说。我不打算重述一遍，这是一个亲切的会见。
    到达华盛顿以后，我们随即在白宫会见了总统。会见时在座的有副总统尼克松先生和国务卿赫脱先生。我是一个急性子的人、直爽的人，虽然这可能不大完全合乎外交礼节，我在第一次会谈中我就问，副总统为什么要在我到来的前夕发表这种讲话。关于下级人士发表的一些不友好的言论和文章，我就不再谈了。
    总统说，他没有读尼克松的这篇讲话。于是我说，不值得去读这篇讲话，因为这已经是过去的事情了（掌声）。
    这是一个在某种程度上说明了这次接待海外客人的准备工作的特点（场内活跃）。
    一踏上美国的土地，就处于严格的警卫之中，以至于根本没有机会同老百姓接触。通过外交谈判，情况才有了改变。
    其次，你们莫斯科人，而且不仅是你们，所有的苏联人——俄罗斯人、乌克兰人、白俄罗斯人、乌兹别克人、格鲁吉亚人、哈萨克人、亚美尼亚人——各族人民总是很好地欢迎客人的。无论客人代表的是什么国家，无论他有什么样的政治信仰，既然他是我们的客人，我们就盛情款待，不仅从外表上，而且从内心里尊敬客人（掌声）。而在美国，我第一天就看到这样的景象：我们同总统一块走；许多人站着，有个人举起手来，挥挥手，但是我看见，手很快就缩回去了，好像触了电似的（笑声）。
    起初，我弄不懂，这是怎么回事。于是我决定更注意地细看站在我们路两旁的人群的脸色。我微微点头向他们打招呼，许多人也开始以同样的动作回答我。这是怎么回事呢？
    后来有人对我说，在我和总统乘车去白宫之前十分钟，有一辆汽车在我们走的路线上驶过。这辆汽车上挂着一个标语牌，上面写着：充分而有礼貌地欢迎客人，但不要鼓掌，也不要致意（场内活跃）。
    后来我问陪我在美国各地访问的总统代表洛奇先生：这是真的吗？我得到的解释是，确实有一辆挂着这种标语牌的汽车驶过。不过，这辆汽车是谁的，据说无人知道（场内笑声）。据说，这辆汽车越过了警察的警戒线。在官方人士向我这样解释的时候，我对他们说，我很难想像，保卫我那样周到的警察竟没有发现挂着这种标语牌的汽车（场内活跃）。
    我确信，总统不知道这一切，这一切不仅违背总统的意愿，而且也违背组织欢迎我们的其他人的意愿。但是，俗语说得好，歌词是删不掉的。
    一踏上美国的土地，我的周围就布置了严格的警卫，以至于根本没有机会同美国老百姓接触。这种警卫简直成了变相的软禁（场内活跃）。他们把我送进关得紧紧的汽车里，我只能从窗户看到欢迎我们的人。人们欢迎我，虽然他们往往看不到我。
    我绝不以为，美国人民所表现出来的友好感情，完全是对我个人或者甚至是对我们的共产主义意识形态。美国人民对我们这种欢迎表示了，他们也像我们一样，主张为和平和我们两国人民的友谊而奋斗（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    我不打算详细讲我们同美国人各次会见的情形；显然，你们从报纸上已经知道了。我们访问了华盛顿，然后访问了纽约，在纽约联合国的讲台上，我荣幸地代表苏联政府提出了全面和彻底的裁军建议。（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    我们从纽约前往美国西岸的洛杉矶和旧金山，然后到了衣阿华州和宾夕法尼亚的大工业中心——匹兹堡市。最后返回华盛顿。这是一段不短的旅程：我们参观了美国的各个地区，会见了各种人物。有很多很好的会晤和坦率的交谈。但是，也有过另外一种性质的会晤。
    我们在旅程的前半段看到，有些人像放唱片似的一个劲儿说同样的一套话。讲话的人硬说我在某时曾经讲过我们“要埋葬资本家”。起初我还耐心地解释：我说的其实是，我们“要埋葬资本主义”，意思就是说社会主义不可避免地会取而代替这个衰亡中的社会形式，正如资本主义曾经取而代替了封建主义一样。后来我发现，那些顽固地重复这类问题的人根本不需要你的解释。他们有一个明确的目的：用共产主义来吓唬那些对共产主义概念非常模糊，不了解共产主义是怎么回事的人。
    在洛杉矶市的一次招待会上，市长又开始用这样的态度讲话，这个市长不比别的市长坏，不过可能外交手腕差一点。我当时不得不表示对这种情况的态度了。
    我说，你们是想在每个城市，每次会议上都对我组织敌意的示威吗？如果你们这样接待我，那好吧，俄国有句俗话：“从别人门口转身是并不困难的”（掌声）。如果你们还没有充分准备来进行谈判，如果你们还没有意识到必须消除“冷战”，并且害怕消除冷战，而要继续搞下去，那我们也并不着急，我们可以忍耐。我们既有足够的耐力，也有足够的智慧。我国的情况很好。我国人民非止一次地显示了理智、力量、意志，显示了他们非常善于克服困难：他们能够捍卫自己的祖国、捍卫和平事业（经久不息的掌声）。如果侵略势力企图用刺刀来试探我们的话，人民能够给他们应有的回击（掌声）。
    我当时不得不进入外交谈判。我请外交部长葛罗米柯同志去对陪伴我的总统特派代表洛奇先生说，如果情况不改变过来，我认为就不可能继续访问下去，我就要回华盛顿，再从华盛顿回莫斯科。
    看来这一切都发生了作用。洛奇先生通过葛罗米柯告诉我，他建议按照计划继续前往旧金山和其他城市访问，他说，各地当局将采取措施使这种情况不再发生。
    应当说，通过葛罗米柯同志进行的这次谈判是晚间的事，而到第二天早晨，当我醒过来的时候，的确，一切就都变了。当我们从洛杉矶前往旧金山的时候，我简直如同去掉了“手铐”一样，我有可能走出车厢同人们会见（掌声）。人们同我握手，我也同他们握手，他们鼓掌和微笑，就像你们莫斯科人微笑着欢迎客人一样，让客人高兴，尽一切努力使客人感到他们在受到很好的接待（掌声）。
    苏联代表在旧金山、匹兹堡等地受到居民的热烈欢迎，工人们热情洋溢地对苏联的代表表示敬意。
    当我们抵达旧金山的时候，阳光灿烂和我们的夏天一样美。这个美丽城市的气候完全不同，阳光使我们感到温暖，但是，热诚和毫无拘束的欢迎更加使我们感到温暖（掌声）。
    我们要特别感谢旧金山市市长克里斯托弗先生、加利福尼亚州州长布朗先生、旧金山市民们以及所有对我们这次访问——促进我们两国人民和世界各国人民之间的和平和友好的访问——抱了解态度的人（掌声）。
    我们得到了一切机会同普通人会见和交谈。的确，我们当时已经忙不过来去同人们会见和交谈了，但是，这一切都是由于我们访问的时间太短。说良心话，怀疑地方当局不怀好意的想法消失了。我们同这个美丽的大城市的居民很快建立了良好的接触。
    我特别想指出同码头工人的会见。太平洋海岸码头工人工会领袖布利奇斯先生邀请我和我的同志们去同码头工人谈话。这是一次亲切的会见。同这些纯朴真诚的码头工人相处，我感到就像同苏联工人相处一样（掌声）。我代表苏联工人向他们致意，受到了他们的热烈欢迎，他们也请我转达他们热情的敬意（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    我又想起了访问旧金山附近圣约瑟城计算机制造厂的情景。厂长沃森先生、工厂的职工都亲切地欢迎了我们，详细地用俄语向我们介绍了复杂的生产过程，准备得这样周到是特别令人高兴的。这家工厂、工厂结构、生产组织给我们留下了良好的印象。
    我发现有一个讲解员是乌克兰口音，于是我问他：
    请问您贵姓？（场内活跃）（译注：赫鲁晓夫是用乌克兰文问下面的话的）
    他回答说：
    ——马尔钦科。
    我说：
    ——我向您致意。您的父母健在吗？
    他回答说：
    ——还在。
    ——请向您的父母转达问好。
    他对我表示感谢（场内活跃）。
    但是，在好客的旧金山访问期限满了，我们得坐飞机到美国的另外一个城市——衣阿华州的得梅因去。这是美国农业生产最重要的中心之一。
    我们和州长、市长以及工商界和社会团体的代表热烈会见以后，就到郊外我十分心爱的玉蜀黍地里去了（场内活跃，掌声）。应当说，美国人很会种植玉蜀黍，种成正方形，地里收拾得很好。不错，在那里我也发现了种植玉蜀黍的老手、我的老相识加斯特的一些缺点（笑声、掌声），玉蜀黍种得太密了。这点，当然我是友好地提醒他注意的。
    我们受到了我们的东道主加斯特先生的殷勤接待，他为我们安排了与农民的有趣的会见。在那里，我们会见了从芝加哥来的民主党著名活动家史蒂文森，并和他进行了十分坦率而友好的谈话。
    我想起了这样一段插曲。我们到一所大学的时候，有一个年轻人塞给我一张学生报纸，上面刊载了一篇长文章，翻译告诉我，大学生在文章中对我们来访表示欢迎。但是，这篇文章说，学生对我们的欢迎不会热情，也不会欢呼。可是，结果怎样呢？这些学生（文章就是以他们的名义写的）是些朝气蓬勃的年轻人，他们表现了像我们青年表现的那种热情。他们欢呼、鼓掌，热情洋溢地流露他们的感情。只听见一片这样的呼声：“赫鲁晓夫同志！”、“尼基塔”以及其他真挚热情的字眼（活跃、掌声）。
    我还应当告诉你们，我们在美国最大的工业城市之一——冶金和机器制造业的城市匹兹堡受到居民们热烈欢迎的情况。他们表现了对我们的极度友好和尊敬。当我从飞机场乘车入城的时候，我甚至感到有点不好意思。我们是在晚上十二点抵达匹兹堡。这是一个黑暗的夜晚。但是，当我们一进入市区的时候，沿途都停着汽车，站着许多人。我看见他们在微笑，听见他们在欢呼。
    我们在匹兹堡参观了“梅斯塔”公司的机器制造厂。
    我们感到，工厂的管理处尽力使我们了解这个企业，使我们有可能了解劳动条件。我们在工厂各处参观，同工人谈话。我想指出一个特点：当我们走进去的时候，大家欢迎我们，不过含蓄得很。但是，当我们越接近工人，会见就越亲切，工人们热情洋溢地对我们——苏维埃国家、苏联人民的代表，表示敬意。
    同匹兹堡商界人士和知识界人士的会晤也留下了深刻的印象。这次会见是在当地的一所大学举行的。在匹兹堡照例举行了宴会，宴会上大家讲了话，这些讲话的特点，在我看来，对建立我们两国友好关系的必要性有比较现实的理解。
    好事情很多，但也不要忘记坏事儿。在美国，有一股反对我们、反对缓和紧张局势、鼓吹维持“冷战”的势力。
    听了我的讲话，也许有人会认为，赫鲁晓夫只谈了友好的会见，而隐瞒了敌对的游行示威。不，我不准备不提有人对我们采取敌对态度或不友好态度的事实。对的，这种事情是有的。大家知道，在我访美期间，美国记者是我的旅伴，而来自各国的法西斯流亡者也从一个城市奔波到另一个城市，搬出一些可怜的标语牌。我们碰到一些恶狠狠的美国人的面孔，也碰到一些阴沉沉的美国人的面孔。
    好事情是很多的，但是，也不要忘记坏事儿。这种蛆虫，更正确地说，这些可鄙的蛆虫还活着，而且日后也还会蠢动。
    我为什么说这些呢？为了冷化苏美关系吗？不是的。我之所以说这些，是因为必须了解真情实况，是为了使你们不仅看到使我们愉快的一面，而且也看到另外的、幕后的一面，对这一面是无需隐讳的。在美国，有一股反对我们、反对缓和紧张局势、鼓吹维持“冷战”的势力。闭眼不看到这一点，就等于在反对恶势力、反对魔鬼的斗争中示弱。不，必须揭发他们，必须揭露他们，必须公开鞭鞑他们，必须把他们像魔鬼一样放在煎锅上煎一煎，（笑声，经久不息的掌声）让那些存心继续“冷战”的人发怒暴跳吧。地球上普通的人是不支持他们的，拥有人类理性的人是不支持他们的。
    在访问匹兹堡之后，就结束了我们在美国各地的旅行。
    在介绍旅行美国的情况的最后，我想对我们曾经访问过的各城市和各州的市长和州长、实业界和知识分子的代表、企业和学校的全体人员、工人和农民和所有社会团体的代表表示衷心的感谢。我想特别指出纽约市长华格纳先生、旧金山市长克里斯托弗先生、匹兹堡市长加拉格尔先生、宾夕法尼亚州州长劳伦斯先生、匹兹堡大学校长利奇菲耳德先生、衣阿华州大学校长希耳顿先生、实业界人士约翰斯顿、陶林、伊顿、沃森、麦斯特、加斯特等人所做出的巨大工作。
    数不清的礼物就是对我国和我国伟大的人民的尊重的最好表现。纽约和匹兹堡的市长都把象征性的本市的钥匙送给我们作为纪念。
    顺便谈一谈，我当时对他们说，我把这些钥匙当作信任的象征接受下来。你们可以放心，我向你们保证，决不会在没有得到主人允许的情况下使用这些钥匙（经久不息的掌声）。
    “国际收割机公司”送给我们一部介绍玉蜀黍耕作机械化的影片，艾森豪威尔总统送给我们一头他的私人农场的良种小母牛，海军上将斯特劳斯送一头小公牛和一头小母牛，农场主柯兰芝送一只良种公猪。还有其他许多礼物，我们为此表示感激和谢意（掌声）。
    我想指出，美国报纸、电台和电视台广泛地、基本上正确地和客观地报道了我们在美国的访问。当然，也有个别记者进行不友好的攻击，但是他们不是美国报纸上的主调。
    在访美期间，陪同我和我的同志们访问的有总统的私人代表洛奇先生、美国国务院交际处处长布坎南先生、美国驻苏联大使汤普森先生和他们的夫人以及其他官员，我应该感谢他们，特别感谢洛奇先生。他尽一切力量为我们的访问创造必要的条件，力求使我们了解伟大的美国人民的生活（掌声）。
    我开玩笑地对洛奇先生说，如果命运把我——工人阶级和苏联共产党的代表，和他——资本主义世界的代表抛到一个荒岛上，那么看来，我们会找到共同的语言并在这个岛上保证和平共处（场内活跃。经久不息的掌声）。可是不同社会制度的国家为什么不能保证共处呢？我们的国家也好像在一个岛上。因为在现在有着使各洲之间距离缩短了的现代化交通工具的情况下，我们的地球的确像一个小岛，我们必须认识到这一点。认识到共处的必要性以后，就必须执行和平政策，友好相处，不是舞刀弄枪，而是要销毁武器（掌声）。
    苏美两国首脑进行了坦率的、友好的会谈。所有关心巩固和平的人无疑都会欢迎会谈联合公报。
    同志们！9月25日我又同美国总统在白宫会晤，并且同他坐直升飞机到他的郊外官邸戴维营去。9月25、26、27这三天我们是在那里度过的。我们进行了坦率的、友好的会谈，各自阐述了本国政府对最重要的国际问题以及对改善苏美关系问题的立场。美国国务卿赫脱先生、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同志和随我去的其他一些同志参加了这些会晤和会谈，并且进行了有益的工作。
    我同总统交换意见的主要结果已经发表在今天在报上公布的联合公报中了。可以毫不怀疑，所有关心巩固和平的人都会欢迎这个文件的（经久不息的掌声）。
    不过应当考虑到，我自然没有能一下子就同总统两人使多年来的一大堆“冷战”的积垢都一扫而光。要收拾这堆垃圾——不仅收拾，而且要彻底消灭这堆垃圾，那是需要时间的。把我们隔开的某些现象现在还仍然存在。某些人往往很难摆脱旧的立场、旧的观点、旧的公式。
    然而我可以非常坦率地跟大家讲，亲爱的同志们！同美国总统进行会谈和讨论具体问题后，我得到这么一个印象，他真正希望消除“冷战”状态，建立我们两国的正常关系，促进改善各国的关系（暴风雨般的掌声）。和平现在是不可分割的，光靠两三个国家的努力是不能保障和平的。因此，争取和平的斗争必须有各国人民和所有的国家参加。
    我同美国总统就裁军问题交换了意见。他说，美国政府在研究我们的建议，美国也像我们一样，愿意全面裁军并实行监督。
    看来，我们现在没有理由来拖延这个问题的解决了。但是，从另一方面看，裁军问题是一个很严重的问题，不能要求对方很快地一下子解决这个问题。这个问题当然需要加以研究，以便找到能真正建立信任、保证裁军和国际和平共处的解决办法。
    因此，让我们现在不忙发表意见，让我们耐心点，给与国家领导人研究我们建议的时间。但是，我们不会闲着的，我们将证明必须实行全面、彻底的裁军（掌声）。我们认为我们的建议是达成协议的基础。我们愿意讨论对我们的文件、对我们的建议所提出的一切修改。如果有人提出另一个建议，而建议所要达到的目的同我们所追求的目的又是一样的话，我们也愿意讨论。
    我们同总统就德国问题、缔结对德和约问题交换了意见。我们曾努力证明——我想我们达到了这个目的——西方错误地解释了我们关于缔结和约的建议。有些人竭力设法引起一种不必要的激昂情绪，硬说这是最后通牒等等。这样行动的人显然是想把“冷战”状态继续下去。他们甚至说什么我们关于缔结对德和约的建议几乎是宣布战争。这样歪曲苏联的和平立场，真是多么下流。
    我们还就政府首脑会晤的问题交换了意见。艾森豪威尔总统和我阐述了我们两国政府的立场，并同意这种会晤是必需和有益的。
    我们还同美国总统就他到苏联回访的日期交换了意见。起初，总统打算在今年10月底访问苏联。但是他问我什么季节访问我国最好。我考虑了一下。我们莫斯科人一年四季都喜欢莫斯科。但是对于我们和所有的人说来，最愉快的时期是春天，春天体现着欢欣愉快，体现着生气勃勃的、百花齐放的生命的苏醒。因此我说，我觉得最好在5月底或6月初来访问。最好总统携带夫人、公子夫妇和孙子们一同来。我们也高兴看到总统的兄弟，他曾经同尼克松先生访问过我国。
    总统盛情地邀请我到他的农场去。他让我看他种的玉蜀黍——我既到总统这里来，不能不看看他的玉蜀黍（场内活跃）。我看了艾森豪威尔农场的小牛犊真是好牲口。不过，如果考虑到这个地大物博的国家，我要说，这个农场对于总统来说是不算大的。这是一个不很富裕的农场，那里的土地也不怎么样。但是总统说，他想设法改良土壤，从而留下一个对他的良好纪念。
    我在农场认识了总统的孙子们，并且同他们举行了会议（场内笑声）。我问他们想不想到俄国去。大大小小的孩子们异口同声地说，想到俄国来，想到莫斯科来。大孙子十一岁，小的三四岁。我事先得到了他们的支持。我开玩笑地对总统说，我同他的孙子们比同他本人更容易就回访问题达成协议（场内笑声，掌声），因为孙子们有良好的环境，而他大概有某种障碍，因此不能照他所希望的那样、在他所希望的时间实现他的愿望（掌声）。
    亲爱的同志们，我想对你们说，我不怀疑总统愿意用他的意志和力量在我们两国之间达成协议，建立我们两国人民的友好关系，解决成熟了的问题，以利于巩固和平（掌声）。
    想保持“冷战”的人应当知道，在我们的时代，要挑起战争的疯子必将在战火中烧死。
    但是我有这样一个印象，美国有一股势力，他们的行动同总统是不一致的。这股势力坚持继续进行“冷战”和军备竞赛。这股势力的力量是大，还是小；影响大，还是影响小；是不是会战胜支持总统的那股力量——绝大多数美国人民是支持他的——我不急于对这些问题作最后的回答。
    时间是很好的见证人，正像俄国人所说的：“早晨比晚间要英明些”。这话说得很好。让我们等待早晨吧，何况我们是在黄昏飞回来的，而我讲话时已经是晚上了。我们要很好地弄清楚这一点，可能不止要过一个早晨。但是，我们不会袖手坐着待黎明，坐待国际关系的指针往那一个方向转动。
    但是，我们也将尽一切力量，使晴雨表的指针不是指向“暴风雨”，也不是指向“变化无常”，而是指在“晴”字上面（长时间的鼓掌）。
    同志们，我相信，在目前条件下，当和平力量难以置信地壮大了，当社会主义阵营拥有将近十亿人口并拥有巨大的生产能力的时候，当苏联的工业、农业、科学、技术和文化蓬勃发展的时候，我们能够做许多有利于和平的事情。
    我们的行动是奠定在明智的、真理的基础上的、是得到全体人民支持的。此外，我们还以我们强大的潜力作后盾。让那些想保持“冷战”状态的人知道，以便迟早把“冷战”变成“热战”的人知道吧：在我们的时代只有疯子才会挑起战争，而他们自己必将在战火中烧死（掌声）。
    人民应当给这些疯子穿上紧身衣。我们相信，国家的明智和人类的理智一定会取得胜利（掌声）。用普希金的一句有名的话来说就是：“理智万岁，黑暗消亡！”（经久不息的掌声）。
    亲爱的莫斯科的同志们！我们回到了祖国，看到了我们亲爱的苏联人民的面孔，感到无限的幸福（掌声）。
    在光荣的列宁的党的领导下胜利地建设着共产主义的伟大苏联人民万岁！（经久不息的掌声）。
    苏美友谊万岁！（经久不息的掌声）。
    世界各国人民的友谊万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，全体起立）。
                        （文内小插题为本报编者所加）
