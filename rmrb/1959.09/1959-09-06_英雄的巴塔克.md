    Heroic Batak
    By Our Correspondent Jun Qiang
    Bulgarian comrades like to offer guests "Rodopi" brand cigarettes, so "Rodopi" became one of the first things we became familiar with when we arrived in Bulgaria. But none of us expected to develop such deep feelings for "Rodopi" later on.
    Rodopi is a famous mountain in Bulgaria. It is older and higher than the Balkan Mountains that cut across Bulgaria. It is an oblong mountain range located in southwestern Bulgaria, extending southeast into Greece. We set off from Plovdiv to visit the Batak Hydropower Complex, a famous project in this mountainous region.
    The car left the city of Plovdiv and headed southwest, passing vineyards and apple orchards on both sides of the road. In less than an hour, we entered the mountainous area. The Rodopi Mountains seem to be a group of mountains formed by countless dome-shaped peaks holding hands in circles. The asphalt road is like a ribbon wrapped around the mountainside, and we followed this ribbon through countless valleys, circling from this mountain to that mountain, layer upon layer, deeper into the mountains. After about an hour of driving in the mountains, a patch of red suddenly flashed in the valley ahead. It was a touch of red in all that green! This was a village, and the red roofs of the houses looked particularly lovely in this green valley, like a red flower in the mountains. This is the village of Batak.
      Tradition of Revolutionary Struggle
    Three hundred and one years ago, a group of Bulgarians, seeking to break free from Turkish oppression, came to this small valley to establish their homes. These were the original inhabitants of Batak. The village name was given later by the Turks. The name "Batak" means "a headache-inducing place," and as the name suggests, one can understand the Turkish oppressors' view of this village.
    Batak was one of the first places to develop revolutionary ideas against the Turks. During the famous April Uprising in Bulgarian history in 1876, it became one of the regions actively resisting Turkish oppression. In this uprising, the people of Batak displayed unparalleled heroism and inflicted a great blow on the Turks. When the uprising was suppressed, the enemy carried out massacres and arson in the village, not even sparing the women and children hiding in the church. When we visited Batak, we first went to see this church. Traces of the struggle at that time can still be identified from the walls and corners near the door. In the center of the church is a large stone box containing more than half a box of skulls, the remains of those who sacrificed themselves in the April Uprising. This old, low stone church has now become a memorial hall for the village of Batak. How could the people of Batak ever forget this bloody sacrifice? After this catastrophe, only a little more than a thousand of Batak's six thousand five hundred residents remained.
    The children and grandchildren of Batak inherited the revolutionary spirit of their fathers' heroic struggle. They were among the first to take up arms in the guerrilla war against fascism, making Batak one of the first guerrilla areas opened up in Bulgaria. As early as 1941, two Batak residents, Chorakov and Chaushev, killed police officers of the pro-royal fascist government, rescued patriots, and went up to the Rodopi Mountains to establish a guerrilla detachment, which later became a branch of the famous Anton Ivanov guerrilla brigade, contributing their strength in the anti-fascist struggle. Of course, it also endured many sacrifices and hardships. In the winter of the year before victory, at the most difficult time, the members could only eat a spoonful of flour each day, and the snow was knee-deep. In the guerrilla war, more than thirty Batak residents fell. The portraits and remains of these martyrs are now also housed in the church memorial hall.
    Chorakov, the founder of the guerrilla detachment, eventually sacrificed himself. The people of Batak respect him very much, calling him "the bravest of the brave." Now, the people of Batak plan to suggest to the Party and the government that the newly built, largest national Batak Hydropower Complex be named after "Chorakov."
      Tunnel Through the Rodopi
    Near this heroic village of Batak, in the Rodopi Mountains where guerrillas shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, workers blasted mountains and dug tunnels, using mountain streams to generate electricity, and built the largest underground hydroelectric power system in the country.
    The Batak Hydropower Complex has a total of three power stations, of which the Batak Power Station and the Peshtera Power Station are underground, and the Aleko Power Station is above ground. The water first flows through tunnels to the reservoir, and then through tunnels to the generators. The tunnels pass through the belly of the Rodopi Mountains, with a total length of seventy-two kilometers. The total annual power generation of the three power stations is 605 million kilowatt-hours, which is almost double the total power generation of Bulgaria before liberation. In addition to power generation, the water used by the power station can also irrigate 350,000 decares of land. This land is located in the plains of the most fertile regions of Plovdiv and Pazardzhik, which are rich in tomatoes, grapes, wheat, and hemp.
    The first power station in the hydropower complex is the Batak underground hydroelectric power station, which is the highest in altitude. The water used by it flows to the larger Batak Reservoir. The Batak Reservoir is like a gourd that has grown crooked, and the dam is built on the narrowest part of the gourd neck in the valley. We met Ivan Krestev, the reservoir technician, by the dam. This middle-aged man with a small mustache was talkative and enthusiastic. He described to us how this large reservoir with a capacity of 310 million cubic meters and an altitude of more than 1,100 meters sends water through a five-kilometer-long tunnel to the turbines of the largest power station in the hydroelectric system—the Peshtera Hydroelectric Power Station.
    The main entrance of the Peshtera Power Station looks like just an ordinary tunnel entrance in the valley. The tunnel slopes downward, and a row of fluorescent lights on the arched roof of the tunnel looks like a sparkling silver snake from the entrance. You simply don't know how deep it will lead you. We walked down the tunnel step by step, and it took a long time to reach the power station building. It is as tall and bright as a general hydroelectric power station building, with four generators installed. But think about how many difficulties would be encountered in building such a large factory building in the belly of these towering mountains! The workers of the Plev team later told us that digging such a large machine room was not only difficult, but also fraught with danger. But the workers completed the task brilliantly, without any accidents. What inspired them to overcome the difficulties? They said that when they were working, they couldn't help but think of the past. They always thought about how they should redouble their efforts to build socialism so as not to let down the guerrillas who fought in the Rodopi Mountains!
      Countless Model Deeds
    The people of Batak village, who have embarked on a new socialist life, the sons of farmers with revolutionary traditions, are proud that the largest hydropower station in the country is built in their hometown. They actively participated in the construction and warmly received builders from all over the country. They vacated their houses for the builders to live in, and regarded the construction workers as guests in their own homes. At one time, this village of only seven thousand people received four thousand people at once, and almost every household had "guests." Many Batak residents became tunnel miners, cement workers, and truck drivers. And some became nationally renowned advanced workers. Like truck driver Asen Michev, who drove his truck for 100,000 kilometers without overhaul.
    Peychinov, the Party secretary of the hydropower complex, is from Batak village. We sat in his office with reverence, listening to him tell us about the past and present of Batak village, and about the people who built the hydropower station. This secretary looks completely like a simple farmer. His wrinkled face shows that he is a battle-hardened warrior. Indeed, this is the case. Comrade Peychinov grew up in battle. He participated in the student movement when he was in middle school, was expelled from school, was arrested, and during World War II, there was a period when the guerrilla detachment lost contact with Batak village. This contact was later re-established by Peychinov.
    During the most intense period of the hydropower station's construction, the number of workers was more than 100,000, and how many outstanding heroes emerged among them! Like Andreev of the tunneling team, he is a famous person who can overcome difficulties the most, and now the Party and the government are preparing to award him the title of "Socialist Labor Hero." The team led by Maksimov created the highest tunneling speed in the country. The Plev team has been rewarded almost every month for its excellent work performance from 1954 until the completion of the power station... Heroic figures and model deeds are too numerous to mention. Unfortunately, most of them have transferred to other construction sites after the completion of the power station. Only the Plev team is still at the "Wide Fields" construction site of the power station system, which is still more than ten kilometers away from the Kralevo Reservoir, the highest altitude in the power station system at more than 1,500 meters above sea level. They are digging tunnels there, preparing to collect the nearby mountain water into the reservoir to increase the water volume.
    We decided to visit the Plev team at "Wide Fields."
      Visiting Heroes in the Deep Mountains in the Rain
    We circled along the mountain road, advancing layer by layer into the depths of the Rodopi Mountains. At this time, the mountain color suddenly darkened, and the wind and rain arrived immediately. We sat in the car as if we were sitting on a boat being blown by wind and waves, swaying from side to side.
    The higher we went, the smaller the rain became. When we arrived at "Wide Fields," the rain had stopped. This valley is indeed wide and open.
    We didn't find Plev. He is going to travel to the Soviet Union soon, and he has gone to the city to handle the procedures. When the team members saw us, they immediately put down their tools and surrounded us, vying to introduce the situation of the work team. A team member named Velinov said: "Our work team participated in the construction of the Peshtera Power Station, the largest of the three hydropower stations, and was one of the first work teams to come here. That was in 1954. When we first came to the mountains, we had nothing. We knew in our hearts that there was a power station construction plan, but we couldn't see what it would look like, and we couldn't imagine what this empty valley would look like in the future."
    Then he talked about why their team can maintain frequent awards. He said: "We understand that power is the foundation of the future, and we must produce electricity faster to speed up construction. Also, our captain Plev is an upright person, a good party member, and our branch committee member. He cares about comrades and can think of ways. We all like him. We feel that we have a great responsibility when we work, a responsibility to the Party, and a responsibility to Plev... We overfulfill the task by 70%-80% every day, so our team always wins awards. I remember once when we finished digging the tunnel, when the installation workers came to lay the cement pipes, stones always fell from the top of the tunnel, and the installation workers had no way to carry out their work. It was about to hinder the progress of the project. The leaders of the work area called Plev to discuss whether our team could have any solutions. Plev came back and discussed it with everyone, and simply our team took on the task of installing cement pipes. Why? Because we dug the tunnel, and we are familiar with every stone. We know which stone may fall, and we can avoid the danger. Also, this tunnel is like our own home, we love it. Later, we completed this task without any accidents."
    Sitting in this valley in the high mountains, listening to the heroic labor deeds of the Plev team, listening to their current and future plans to increase the water volume of the reservoir, we couldn't help but think about how precious the Bulgarian people are in utilizing every water source! This Batak power generation system is the best proof of the use of high mountain water sources. Not to mention the rivers on the plains. Like the famous Maritsa River, it looks like the riverbed is almost dry, but in fact there is a lot of water, but it has all been diverted by the dense irrigation areas.
    It was getting close to dusk. We said goodbye to the Plev team and went down the mountain. All the way, we thought about how the Bulgarian workers are using every drop of water for power and irrigation. Under the hands of such hardworking people, how can the socialist land not bloom with beautiful flowers!

    英雄的巴塔克
    本报记者　君强
    保加利亚同志喜欢用“罗多彼”牌香烟待客，因此“罗多彼”就成为我们来到保加利亚首先熟识的东西之一了。但是我们都没有想到后来竟对“罗多彼”产生了深厚的感情。
    罗多彼是保加利亚的一座名山。它比拦腰横贯保加利亚的巴尔干山更古老，也更高。它是盘踞在保加利亚西南部的一个长形山脉，向东南一直延伸到希腊境内。我们从普罗夫迪夫出发去访问这个著名的山区中的巴塔克水力枢纽工程。
    汽车离开普罗夫迪夫市向西南行，驰过公路两旁的葡萄园和苹果园，不到一小时就进入了山区。罗多彼山好像是由无数圆顶山手拉着手一圈圈围成的一个山群，柏油公路像是缠在山腰上的缎带，我们就顺着这条带子驰过无数山谷，从这座山绕向那座山，一圈圈一层层地向山里走。我们大约这样在山中转了一个钟头，前面的山谷中突然闪出一片红色，真是万绿丛中一点红！这是一个村庄，房屋的红顶在这绿色山谷中显得特别可爱，像是山丛中的一朵红花。这就是巴塔克村。
      革命斗争的传统
    三百零一年前，一群保加利亚人想摆脱土耳其人的压迫，跑到这个小山谷建立起家园，这就是巴塔克的最初居民。村名是后来土耳其人起的。“巴塔克”几个字的意思是“令人头疼的地方”，顾名思义，就可以知道土耳其压迫者对这个村庄的看法了。
    巴塔克是第一批产生了反抗土耳其革命思想的地方，在1876年保加利亚历史上有名的四月起义中，它成了积极反抗土耳其压迫者的地区之一。在这次起义中，巴塔克人表现了无比的英雄气概，给了土耳其人很大的打击。当起义被镇压，敌人就在村里大肆烧杀，甚至连躲在教堂里的妇女和儿童也不放过。我们来到巴塔克村访问时，首先就去这个教堂参观，从门边墙角还可以辨出当时搏斗的痕迹。教堂中央放着一个大石箱，里边装着大半箱头骨，这是四月起义牺牲者的遗骨。这石砌的古老矮小的教堂如今已成为巴塔克村的纪念馆了。怎能让巴塔克人不永远记住这次血的牺牲呢，经过这次浩劫，巴塔克的六千五百居民只剩下一千多人了。
    巴塔克村的儿孙们继承了父辈英勇斗争的革命精神，在反抗法西斯的游击战中最先拿起武器，使巴塔克成了保加利亚最先开辟的游击地区之一。还在1941年，巴塔克人乔拉科夫和查乌舍夫二人打死保皇法西斯政府的警察，救出爱国者，跑上罗多彼山建立了游击队，后来并成为著名的安东·伊万诺夫游击队的一个支队，在反法西斯斗争中贡献了自己的力量。当然它也忍受过不少牺牲和艰难困苦。在胜利前一年的冬天，最困苦的时候队员们每天只能吃一匙面粉，而且雪深没胫。在游击战中，三十多个巴塔克人倒下去了。这些烈士的遗像和遗骨，如今也都安放在教堂纪念馆中了。
    游击队创始人乔拉科夫最后终于牺牲了。巴塔克人非常尊重他，称他为“勇敢中的最勇敢的人”。现在，巴塔克人打算向党和政府建议把新建成的全国最大的巴塔克水力枢纽工程以“乔拉科夫”命名。
      隧道穿通罗多彼
    在这英雄的巴塔克村附近，在这罗多彼山峦中游击队员流血牺牲的地方，工人们开山挖隧道，利用山间的溪水变成电力，建起了全国最大的地下水力发电系统。
    巴塔克水力枢纽工程共有三个发电站，其中巴塔克电站和彼什特拉电站在地下，阿列科电站在地上。水先经过隧道流向水库，再通过隧道流向发电机。隧道穿过罗多彼山腹，总长达七十二公里。三个发电站每年总发电量是六亿零五百万度，超过解放前保加利亚全国发电量将近一倍。除发电外，电站用过的水还可以灌溉三十五万狄卡尔土地。这些土地正好处在全国最富饶的普罗夫迪夫和巴札尔奇克地区的平原，这是盛产蕃茄、葡萄、小麦和麻的地方。
    水力枢纽工程中的第一个电站，是地势最高的巴塔克地下水电站，它用过的水流向更大的巴塔克水库。巴塔克水库像一个长歪了的葫芦，坝就建在山谷最狭的葫芦颈上。我们在坝边遇到了水库技术员伊万·克列斯捷夫。这是个留着两撮小胡的中年人，他健谈热情，向我们描述这个容水量为三亿一千万立方、海拔一千一百多米的大水库，怎样通过五公里长的隧道把水送到水电系统中最大的发电站——彼什特拉水电站的涡轮机去。
    彼什特拉电站的正门，看起来只是普通山谷中的一个隧道入口。隧道是向下倾斜着的，隧道拱形顶上的一排日光灯，从入口处看去像是一条闪光的银蛇，你简直不知道它会把你引到多么深的去处。我们顺着隧道一步步地走下去，走了很久才来到电站厂房。这儿像一般的水电站厂房一样高大明亮，装着四部发电机。但是想一想，在这崇山峻岭之中的山腹里，建筑这样的大厂房，会遇到多少困难啊！普列夫工作队的工人们后来告诉我们，挖这样大的机器房不仅困难，而且不知有多少危险。可是工人们出色地完成了任务，没有发生任何事故。是什么鼓舞着他们克服困难呢？他们说，干活儿时，不由地就联想到过去。总是想，要怎样加倍努力建设社会主义，才能不辜负在罗多彼山上战斗过的游击队员们！
      模范事迹数不尽
    走上社会主义新生活的巴塔克村的人们，富有革命传统的农民的儿子，以全国最大水电站建在他们故乡而感到自豪。他们积极地参加了建设，同时也热情地接待了来自全国各地的建设者。他们腾出房子请建设者住，把建筑工人看做自己家里的客人。有一个时期，这个只有七千人的村庄，一下子就接待了四千人，几乎家家户户都有“客人”。许多巴塔克人成了隧道挖掘工、水泥工、汽车司机。而且有的成了全国闻名的先进工作者。像汽车司机阿新·米切夫，他开的车走了十万公里没有检修过。
    水力枢纽工程的党委书记彼伊琴诺夫就是巴塔克村人。我们怀着崇敬的心情坐在他的办公室里，听他向我们谈起巴塔克村的过去和现在，谈起建设水电站的人们。这位书记完全是纯朴的农民的样子，他那满脸绉纹，说明他是个饱经风霜的战士。确实是这样。彼伊琴诺夫同志是在战斗中成长起来的。他在中学读书时就参加过学生运动，被学校开除过，被逮捕过，在第二次世界大战期间，有一个时期游击队同巴塔克村失掉了联系，这个联系后来就是由彼伊琴诺夫接上的。
    在水电站施工最紧张的时期，工人多至十万人以上，他们中间涌现了多少出色的英雄啊！像掘进工作队的安德列耶夫，就是有名的最能克服困难的人，现在党和政府准备授给他
  “社会主义劳动英雄”称号。马克辛诺夫率领的工作队则创造了保加利亚全国最高的掘进速度。普列夫工作队从1954年到电站建成，差不多每月都因优良的工作成绩而得到奖励……。英雄人物和模范事迹是难以胜数的。可惜他们绝大多数都在电站建成后转到其他工地去了，只有普列夫工作队还在电站系统的“宽广田地”工地，这个地方距电站系统中最高的海拔一千五百多米的克拉洛夫水库还有十几公里。他们在那儿挖隧道，准备把附近的山水汇集到水库来增加水量。
    我们决定到“宽广田地”去访问普列夫工作队。
      深山冒雨访英雄
    我们盘着山路，一层层地向罗多彼山的深处进发。这时山色忽然阴暗起来，风雨顿时来到。我们坐在车上简直像是坐在一支被风浪吹打的船上，东摇西晃。
    越走越高，雨也越小，来到“宽广田地”时雨已停了，这片谷地的确是宽广开阔。
    我们没有找到普列夫，他不久就要到苏联去旅行，现在到市内办手续去了。队员们看见我们，立刻放下工具围了上来，争着向我们介绍工作队的情况。一位姓维林诺夫的队员说：“我们工作队参加了三个水电站中最大的彼什特拉电站的建筑工作，是最先来到这里的一个工作队。那是1954年。我们刚来到山里，什么都没有。心中知道有电站建筑计划，可是看不出个名堂，也想不出这个空无一人的山谷将来会是个什么样子。”
    接着他谈到他们队为什么能够保持经常得到奖励的事。他说：“我们懂得动力是未来的基础，要更快地生产电力才能加快建设。还有，我们队长普列夫是个正直的人，好党员，是我们的支部委员，他关心同志，而且会想办法，我们都喜欢他。我们在干活时感到自己有很大的责任，对党有责任，对普列夫也有责任……我们每天都超额完成任务70％—80％，所以我们队总是得奖。记得有一次我们把隧道挖好后，安装工人来铺设水泥管时，隧道顶总是掉石头，安装工人没有法子进行工作，眼看就要妨碍工程进度。工区领导把普列夫叫去商量，看我们队能不能有什么办法。普列夫回来和大家一合计，干脆我们队把安装水泥管的工作承担了下来。为什么呢？因为隧道是我们挖的，每块石头我们都熟悉，哪块可能掉下来我们都知道，我们可以躲过危险。还有，这条隧道就像是自己的家一样，我们爱它。后来我们完成了这个任务，什么事故都没有出。”
    坐在这高山中的谷地里听着普列夫工作队的英勇劳动事迹，听着他们现在和未来增加水库水量的计划，我们不由地想到保加利亚人民是多么珍贵地利用每一个水源！这个巴塔克发电系统就是利用高山水源的最好的明证。平原上的河流就更不用说了，像有名的马里查河，看起来河床几乎都快干沽了，其实河水很多，只是都被密密麻麻的灌溉区引走了。
    已近黄昏，我们告别了普列夫工作队，盘山而下。一路上想着保加利亚的工人为了动力，为了灌溉，是怎样地把每一滴水都利用起来。在这样勤劳的人民的双手下，社会主义大地怎会不开出艳丽的花朵呢！
