    Qingdao, September 5th (From Our Newspaper) The steelmaking workshop of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory, using a group of 0.5-ton small converters, achieved an average daily output of over 30 tons for the entire month of August, an increase of 14.81% compared to the previous month. The steel's qualification rate was 99%, with first-grade steel accounting for 95.83%, a rise of 5.78% from July. Furnace life and smelting efficiency also significantly improved. On the 21st, they even set a new record of blowing 51 heats in one day, producing 34.165 tons of steel, with a first-grade ingot rate of 99.15%. The steel materials rolled from their own steel ingots have qualified chemical compositions and mechanical properties, and have been used to manufacture bicycle parts such as wheel rims, chains, spokes, and freewheel shells, all meeting standards.

    Since the second quarter, the factory has focused on the five major elements of carbon, manganese, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus to comprehensively improve the quality of converter steel. Since July, the first-grade rate of steel ingots produced has consistently remained above 90%. Recently, various bicycle parts rolled and forged from this small converter steel have also met specifications, making it a red banner in Qingdao's small and medium-sized converter steel production.

    In the process of small converter steelmaking at the bicycle factory, they overcame extreme equipment limitations and the challenges posed by high-sulfur pig iron as raw material for steelmaking. In the early stages of the Great Leap Forward in Steel, the workers in this unit knew almost nothing about converter steelmaking. Everything was explored and advanced step by step. Equipment was built from scratch, some self-made, some pieced together, until February of this year, when small converter steelmaking began to take shape. But then high sulfur seriously threatened the quality of the steel. In March, under the firm implementation of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee's instructions, a hot-blast alkaline iron furnace was adopted, eliminating high sulfur outside the converter and breaking through the high sulfur barrier. Under the leadership of the general branch of the Party in the workshop, they mobilized employees to launch thematic discussions, learn from experienced masters and friends, and rapidly break through the three barriers of carbon reduction, deoxidation, and ingot casting, increasing the qualified rate of steel ingots.

    Currently, the factory is launching a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, striving to create new achievements in September by using a group of 0.5-ton converters to produce 700 tons, with first-grade steel above 95%, an iron ratio of 1350 kilograms, and a coke ratio of 400 kilograms, to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    青岛自行车厂小转炉一级钢占95％以上
    本报青岛5日电　青岛自行车厂炼钢车间，一组零点五吨小转炉，8月份全月平均日产量在三十吨以上，比上月提高14.81％，钢的合格率为99％，其中一级钢占95.83％，比7月份提高5.78％。炉龄和熔炼效率也显著提高，21日更创造了一天即吹炼五十一炉次，日产钢三十四点一六五吨，钢锭一级品率99.15％的优质高产空前新纪录。用自己所产钢锭轧成的钢材，化学成分合格，机械性能也符合要求，并已用来制造车圈、车链子、辐条、飞轮皮等自行车零件，质量都达到标准。
    自第二季度开始，这个厂就抓紧碳、锰、矽、硫、磷五大元素，全面提高转炉钢的质量，7月以来，生产钢锭的一级品率始终保持在90％以上，最近，他们用这种小转炉钢轧制和锻打的各种自行车零件也都合乎规格，成为青岛中、小转炉炼钢生产中的一面红旗。
    自行车厂小转炉炼钢的过程中，曾经克服了设备极端简陋，用以炼钢的原料又是高硫生铁等所造成的重重困难。在大办钢铁的初期，这个单位的工人们，对转炉炼钢的有关知识几乎是一无所知的。一切都是边摸索边前进。设备也是从无到有，有的自制，有的东拼西凑，直到今年2月，小转炉炼钢才算初具雏形。但接着高硫严重地威胁着钢的质量。到了3月份由于坚决贯彻青岛市委指示，采用热风碱性化铁炉，才将高疏消灭在转炉之外，闯过高硫关。在车间党总支的领导下，他们发动职工展开专题鸣放，拜师访友，学习先进经验，又迅速突破拉碳、脱氧、铸锭三关，使钢锭合格率提高。
    目前，这个厂正在掀起增产节约新高潮，力争9月份用零点五吨的一组转炉创造出产量七百吨，质量一级钢在95％以上，铁比一千三百五十公斤，焦比四百公斤的新成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
