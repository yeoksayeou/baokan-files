Ten Years of Brilliance

Commerce Over the Past Ten Years

Yao Yilin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance and Trade of the CPC Central Committee

The great People's Republic of China has been established for ten glorious years. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, our country has made extremely brilliant achievements in all aspects. The achievements in commerce are also part of it. The general line of the socialist revolution and the general line of socialist construction of the Chinese Communist Party are the lighthouse illuminating our progress, guiding our work in all aspects, including commercial work, from one victory to another.

The development of China's commercial work in the past ten years can be seen from the following three aspects:

First, the volume of commodity circulation in our country has rapidly expanded and multiplied in the past ten years. Looking at the growth of total retail sales of social commodities: In 1950, the total retail sales of social commodities in my country was 17.06 billion yuan, and by 1952, when the task of restoring the national economy was completed, it increased to 27.68 billion yuan, an increase of 62%; By 1957, when the first five-year plan was completed, it increased to 47.42 billion yuan, an increase of 1.8 times compared with 1950. 1958 was a year of overall great leap forward in my country's national economy. In this year, the total retail sales of social commodities was 54.8 billion yuan, an increase of 2.2 times compared with 1950; in 1959, the leap forward continued, and the total retail sales of social commodities is expected to be 61.5 billion yuan, an increase of 2.6 times compared with 1950. The above situation shows that the growth rate of total retail sales of social commodities in my country is very fast, especially in 1958 and 1959, the growth rate is even faster. These figures show that my country's national economy is developing at a high speed; they show that the income of our people is constantly increasing and the living standards of the people are constantly improving; they show the great leap forward in my country's national economy in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959. These figures also reflect the rapid development of commodity production in my country, the continuous expansion of material exchanges between urban and rural areas, between regions, and between ethnic groups, and the increasing consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and national unity in my country.

Second, the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce has achieved a decisive victory on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. At present, my country's market has become a unified socialist market suitable for my country's conditions and the needs of the people. Socialist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce are the main body of this market. They operate most of the social commodities, and their institutions are spread throughout the cities and villages of the country. In addition to state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, there are also farmers' trade markets under state leadership and small vendors organized through collectivization, as supplements to state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. As for joint state-private enterprises, they are no different from state-owned commerce, except that capitalists are still receiving fixed interest according to the redemption policy. Speculators are not allowed to participate in farmers' trade markets. The commodities in farmers' trade markets are directly sold by producers, and market transactions are carried out under the management of the state and the leadership of the socialist economy. Therefore, it is different from free markets of a capitalist nature. Small vendors have been organized into cooperative stores and cooperative groups. They mainly act as agents for the state to purchase and sell some small but varied scattered commodities. They accept state leadership and supervision politically, organizationally, in commodity prices, and in service methods. Therefore, they are also different from small vendors of a capitalist nature. My country's socialist commerce is a new type of commerce. Socialist commerce serves production, and all its activities are based on the principle of being conducive to the development of production; socialist commerce serves the people's lives, and it tries its best to meet the people's living needs. It is fundamentally different from the capitalist commerce that only seeks profit. Only under the socialist system has my country first appeared commerce with the purpose of completely "serving the people."

Third, my country's socialist commerce is the most efficient and cost-effective commerce in my country's history. It fully embodies the superiority of the socialist system in business management. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the total retail sales of social commodities has increased by 2.6 times, but the number of employees in social commerce has not only not increased, but has decreased. In 1949, the number of employees in social commerce in my country was about 6.85 million. In 1951, it once reached about 9 million, but in 1958, it had dropped to about 6.4 million. Commodity circulation costs have also been declining year by year. The reason why my country's socialist commerce has made great progress in business management is because it has resolutely implemented the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, running enterprises through diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong; it is because it has resolutely implemented the mass line working method proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the mass line working method has been further developed in the commercial sector. The socialist system has a high degree of planning and organization, and can incorporate commodity production and commodity circulation into the plan, reasonably organize commodity transportation, and greatly save manpower and material resources. Because the socialist system has eliminated the free competition and anarchy of capitalist commerce, it has simplified commodity circulation links and reduced unnecessary commercial employees, reduced commodity packaging costs and advertising costs. Because the socialist system has eliminated the private ownership of capitalist commerce, it is possible to comprehensively adjust and arrange the commercial network according to the layout of production and the needs of the people's lives, give full play to the efficiency of various equipment, and improve the labor efficiency of each commercial employee.

Socialist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce are an important weapon for implementing the Party's general line of socialist revolution

In the process of socialist revolution, socialist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce are an important weapon for implementing the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and implementing the Party's general line of socialist revolution.

In cities, socialist commerce adopted the method of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales to capitalist industry, supplying raw materials and purchasing finished products, and putting capitalist industry on the track of state capitalism. After adopting this method, the state can correctly use the production capacity of capitalist industry to produce commodities and supply the needs of the people; on the other hand, it can cut off the direct connection between capitalist industry and the market in terms of raw material purchase and finished product sales, so that capitalist industry is under the restriction of the state, preventing them from hoarding, making waves in the market, and making huge profits. At the same time, socialist commerce can also support the workers' movement in capitalist industry, unite, educate, and transform capitalists, and prepare conditions for further implementing the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry.

In rural areas, socialist commerce, through the management of the rural market, uniformly purchased important agricultural products, and implemented planned purchase and planned supply of major agricultural products such as grain and oil, effectively打击了投机商人, restricted the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas, and supported the agricultural cooperation movement; and through the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products, it expanded the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and promoted the development of agriculture and sideline production.

Because socialist commerce carried out the above work in both cities and rural areas at the same time, the state gradually mastered the sources of all important agricultural products and all important industrial products; gradually made socialist wholesale commerce completely replace capitalist wholesale commerce in urban and rural areas; developed socialist retail commerce to some extent; enabled the state to wholesale commodities to private retailers according to the specific conditions stipulated, allowing them to carry out distribution and consignment sales business; enabled socialist commerce to organize urban and rural small vendors who are individual commercial workers into cooperative stores and cooperative groups, guiding them onto the road of collectivization. All of this prepared the conditions for the overall joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce.

In the process of socialist transformation, the struggle between socialist commerce and capitalist industry and commerce and spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas is a sharp and complex class struggle. In the autumn and winter of 1955, the high tide of agricultural cooperation finally cut off the road for the development of capitalism in rural areas, fundamentally changed the comparison of class forces in my country, and capitalist industry and commerce implemented the overall joint state-private ownership. My country achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front. After the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, my country achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. However, the class struggle has not finally ended. In the process of socialist transformation, socialist commerce absorbed a large number of capitalist wholesalers and retailers to participate in the work. These people are still receiving fixed interest according to the redemption policy, and their capitalist ideology cannot but frequently have a corrosive effect in socialist commerce. The small vendors who were absorbed into socialist commerce to work or formed cooperative stores and cooperative groups, although they are individual commercial workers, and most of them support the socialist system, a part of them are also deeply infected with capitalist ideology because they have been engaged in commercial activities in the old society for a long time. Therefore, the class struggle, especially the class struggle in the ideological field, must be carried out repeatedly for a long time in the commercial sector in the future. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Throughout the entire transition period, that is, before the socialist society is built, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, is always the main contradiction within our country." Only under the specific conditions of our country at present, this contradiction, in most cases, manifests itself as contradictions among the people, except when it manifests itself as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy at certain times, and should generally be resolved according to the rectification.

The basic task of commercial work is: to serve production on the one hand and to serve consumption on the other

In the process of socialist construction, socialist commerce plays an extremely important role in the entire national economy. Consumer goods and a part of the means of production (mainly agricultural means of production) in industrial products, and the commodity part of agricultural products must be purchased, allocated, and distributed by socialist commerce to industrial production departments, rural people's communes, and the broad masses of consumers. Many export commodities need to be organized and supplied by commercial departments to foreign trade departments. Many imported commodities need to be organized and sold domestically by commercial departments. Commerce is the link between production departments and production departments, between production and consumption, and the bridge between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants. Marxist-Leninist political economics tells us that production, exchange, distribution, and consumption are unified, and production plays a decisive role among them. Production determines exchange, distribution, and consumption, but exchange, distribution, and consumption, in turn, affect production to a certain extent. Production is the starting point, and consumption is the end point. Exchange and distribution are the intermediaries from production to consumption. These principles of political economics determine the basic tasks of commercial work: to serve production on the one hand and to serve consumption on the other.

All measures of commercial work must be conducive to promoting the development of production. All commercial workers should often understand the situation of industrial and agricultural production and be very concerned about the development of industrial and agricultural production. When industrial departments and rural people's communes need means of production, commercial departments should actively organize the supply of means of production and meet the needs of production departments as much as possible. When industrial departments and rural people's communes need to sell industrial and agricultural products, commercial departments should actively purchase and correctly organize distribution and sales work so that production departments can carry out reproduction and expanded reproduction in a timely manner. When there is insufficient industrial raw materials or agriculture encounters disasters, commercial departments should do everything possible to help them overcome difficulties and increase production. Commercial work is linked to the fate and breathing of industrial and agricultural production. Without the development of production, it is impossible to expand commodity circulation. However, conversely, if commercial work is done well, it can promote the development of production. If commercial work is not done well, it will also have an adverse impact on production. Therefore, commercial work is by no means passive and negative to production, but has an active and dynamic role. In the first half of this year, the supply of small commodities in the market was once insufficient. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the commercial departments convened national, provincial, municipal, prefectural, county, and people's commune-level commodity exchange meetings, which greatly promoted the production of small commodities in urban and rural areas and gradually met the needs of the market. This is an example of the positive role of commercial work in promoting production development.

All measures of commercial work must be conducive to meeting the needs of the people's lives. The purpose of developing production is precisely to meet needs. Commercial departments should correctly do a good job in commodity distribution, strive to achieve rational distribution, save consumers' time to purchase commodities, and make consumers feel convenient. When commodity production cannot fully meet the needs of the people's lives, commercial departments should pay close attention to the rational distribution of commodities; when the people's living needs change, commercial departments should organize production in a timely manner according to needs and correctly guide consumption. When the quality of commodities cannot maintain the due level, commercial departments should actively assist production departments to improve the quality of commodities. All commercial departments should continuously improve service quality and improve service attitude to make consumers as satisfied as possible.

In order to correctly implement the Party's commercial policy and mobilize the masses to complete the tasks of commercial work, commercial work must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Party. Commercial departments at all levels must obey the leadership of the Party committees at the same level and must complete the tasks of commercial work itself around the central tasks decided by the Party committees. In view of the fact that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory, the Party Central Committee decided in 1957 to implement the method of unified leadership and hierarchical management for commercial work, delegating most of the powers to the Party committees at all levels for management and canceling the system of professional companies. The experience of the Great Leap Forward in commercial work in 1958 proved that this decision was correct. Centralization and decentralization are the unity of opposites. Delegating most of the management powers of commercial work does not mean that unified leadership and necessary centralized management are not needed. My country's commerce is socialist commerce with a high degree of planning. Therefore, major commercial policies and management systems must have unified national standards, important commodities must be uniformly distributed by the state, and the prices of important commodities must be uniformly stipulated by the state. Only by correctly combining centralization and decentralization can we guarantee the unity of the national commercial plan and give play to the enthusiasm of the localities and the broad masses. The market prices in my country have been basically stable for nearly ten years

Stabilizing prices is an important policy of the Party and an important task of commercial work. Since the state took measures to stabilize prices in March 1950, the market prices in my country have been basically stable for nearly ten years. The national wholesale price index was only 92.7 in 1958, with March 1950 as 100; the retail price index of eight major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Chongqing was only 101.4 in 1958, with March 1950 as 100. This stable price situation has created extremely favorable conditions for the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives in our country. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the report to the First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Before the national liberation, our country experienced twelve years of serious inflation, and prices fluctuated frequently. After liberation, in response to this situation, the basic policy of the Party was to stabilize prices. That is to say, regardless of whether certain prices were reasonable at the time, first stabilize all prices at the current level, and after stabilization, make some adjustments to some very unreasonable prices. The Party's basic policy was correct, and the result of implementing this policy was successful. It has played a beneficial role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in our country."

Stabilizing prices does not mean that all commodity prices are fixed and unchanged, nor does it mean that individual commodity prices are not adjusted. In the past ten years, under the premise of maintaining the basic stability of the price level, we have continuously used the role of the law of value to adjust the prices of individual commodities, some lowered and some raised, so that the price policy is conducive to promoting the development of production. Since March 1950, the state has increased the purchase price of agricultural products, but the selling price of industrial and agricultural products in the market, on the whole, has been basically stable, and the price ratio between industrial and agricultural products has been gradually reduced. Farmers can exchange the same agricultural products for more industrial products than in the past. From the perspective of different regions, the prices of industrial products in coastal areas with convenient transportation are basically stable and slightly lower, and the prices of agricultural products are slightly higher; the prices of industrial products in remote and backward areas are reduced relatively more, and the prices of agricultural products are also increased relatively more. The purpose of implementing this method is to take into account the gradual improvement of the people's lives in remote and backward areas.

Doing a good job in the rational distribution of grain through commercial links plays an important role in improving the grain supply situation in our country

In the past ten years, we have achieved great victories on the grain front. Grain production has greatly increased. In 1949, my country's grain output was 216.2 billion catties, with an average of less than 400 catties per person according to the national population; in 1958, my country's grain output was 500 billion catties, with an average of nearly 800 catties per person according to the national population. In the past ten years, the total grain output has increased by nearly one and a half times, and the average per person has increased by nearly one time, which is rare in the world. In particular, in 1958 alone, the total grain output increased from 370 billion catties in 1957 to 500 billion catties, an increase of 35%, which is an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. Due to the increase in grain output, the grain supply situation in my country has greatly improved. However, has my country's grain problem been completely solved? Not yet. To solve the needs of people eating, livestock eating, and reserves, and to greatly increase the supply of meat and milk to improve the people's living standards, an average of 800 catties of grain per person per year is obviously not enough. It still needs to be worked hard for a relatively long time to make my country's grain output fully meet all the needs of the people in our country. The key to solving my country's grain problem lies in further increasing my country's grain output and realizing agricultural mechanization as soon as possible.

Before my country's grain problem is completely solved, doing a good job in the rational distribution of grain through commercial links plays an important role in improving the grain supply situation in our country. Even after the grain problem is completely solved, it is still necessary to attach great importance to the distribution of grain. Since the implementation of the grain unified purchase and sales system in 1953, practice has proved that this system has not only powerfully cooperated with the agricultural cooperation movement and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, but also powerfully supported socialist industrialization and guaranteed the stability of market prices and people's lives. My country's grain unified purchase and sales system has two main characteristics: First, the state purchases grain from farmers according to the principle of equal exchange. The state has formulated grain purchase prices by referring to the historical grain price level in our country and the reasonable price ratio between grain and industrial products, ensuring that farmers can get the monetary income they deserve after selling grain. The price at which the state sells grain in rural areas is only 8% higher than the purchase price after adding operating expenses, storage losses, and taxes, and both the purchase price and the sales price remain unchanged throughout the year. This price policy is completely fair and reasonable for farmers. It is completely different from the method of private merchants operating grain under the capitalist system, who lower the purchase price after the autumn and raise the selling price in the spring, with large seasonal price differences, exploiting farmers. Second, the state has adopted the method of planned supply, which not only comprehensively arranges the grain needs of cities, but also comprehensively arranges the grain needs of rural areas. The state purchases grain from farmers on the basis of comprehensively arranging the grain needs of all farmers. The state has verified the rational consumption of grain by farmers in each region according to the grain production and consumption situation in different regions, after discussion and consent of the farmers. For farmers with surplus grain, first let them keep the self-use rations, seeds, and feed, and then sell most of the surplus grain to the state; for all grain-deficient farmers, the state reasonably supplies the grain they lack. In the past seven years, the Party's grain unified purchase and sales policy has been supported by the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas. Our country is a large country, and natural disasters occur in some places every year, affecting crop yields. Since the implementation of the grain unified purchase and sales policy, the state has guaranteed that the people in disaster areas can get the necessary grain supply at the price stipulated by the state, so that the production sentiment of the people in disaster areas remains stable and production and construction continue. Compared with the situation in our country's history when famines occurred, people fled everywhere, sold their children and daughters, fields were barren, and there were starvation everywhere, this is a clear contrast. This fully proves the superiority of the socialist system on this issue.

Going all out and producing more grain is the fundamental way to completely solve my country's grain problem. In order to encourage farmers to increase grain production, my country has implemented the policy of fixed output, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain in rural areas. That is to say, according to the normal years in rural areas, determine the grain output, determine the amount of grain purchased and sold by the state, and keep it unchanged for several years. In these years, the state will only purchase a small portion of the actual output exceeding the fixed output, and most of the rest will be used by the farmers themselves. This method has been supported by people's communes and production teams in various places. In terms of grain, in addition to increasing grain production, careful calculation, frugality, and saving grain is also an important policy. We must never consume as much grain as we produce. We must look forward and backward, make up for deficiencies with abundance, accumulate bit by bit, and leave room for maneuver. We must learn to live a good life and gradually increase the grain reserves of the state, people's communes, and individual farmers.

The root cause of the shortage of certain commodities is that the growth rate of production cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs. As long as we adhere to the Party's general line, these temporary difficulties can be overcome one by one

In the past ten years, a phenomenon has sometimes been encountered in the social life of our country, that is, the supply of certain commodities falls short of demand. In terms of variety, sometimes it is certain non-staple foods, sometimes it is certain daily-use industrial products; sometimes it is these types, sometimes it is those types. The root cause of this phenomenon is that the growth rate of the production of certain commodities in our country cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs. The growth rate of commodity production in our country is very fast. In 1949, there were only 25 million pigs sold as commodities across the country, which had increased to 42 million by 1958. In 1949, the national output of cotton yarn was only 1.8 million pieces, and the output of cotton cloth was only 1.9 billion meters; by 1958, the national output of cotton yarn had reached 6.1 million pieces, and the output of cotton cloth had reached 5.7 billion meters. In 1949, the country only produced 27,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, which had produced 810,000 tons by 1958; in 1952, the country only produced 15,000 tons of agricultural pesticides, which had produced 82,000 tons by 1958. In the short span of ten years, such a multiple, several times, or even dozens of times increase in commodity production in our country has never happened in our history. However, despite the rapid growth of commodity production, there are still times when the supply of certain commodities falls short of demand. This is because the unemployment phenomenon left over from the old society has been completely eliminated in our country; the number of employed workers has increased by more than four times compared with before liberation; the living standards of farmers have greatly improved compared with before liberation. Under the conditions of the country's high-speed industrial construction, with the rapid improvement of the living standards of the people across the country, and with the old balance of the national economy being broken and a new balance being established, it is not surprising that the supply of certain commodities falls short of demand for a period of time. Doesn't this precisely reflect the thriving atmosphere of the vigorous development of our national economy? Comparing this phenomenon in our country with the sad and bleak phenomenon under the capitalist system where commodities are piled up like mountains, but the broad masses of working people have no money to buy commodities, doesn't this precisely prove that the socialist system will never have economic crises like the capitalist system? The difficulties of the shortage of certain commodities that our country sometimes encounters in the past ten years are temporary difficulties in the process of progress and development. As long as we adhere to the Party's general line of socialist construction, adhere to the high-speed development of the national economy, and adhere to the whole set of walking on two legs policies such as giving priority to the development of heavy industry and simultaneously developing industrial and agricultural production and simultaneously developing heavy and light industry, these difficulties will definitely be overcome one by one.

Commercial departments need to regularly calculate the growth of social commodity purchasing power, regularly calculate whether the social commodity supply is adapted to the needs of purchasing power, regularly cooperate closely with industrial and agricultural production departments, promote the development of production, and strive to organize more commodity sources to supply the needs of the people. In the purchase of industrial and agricultural products, all commodities that should be purchased and can be purchased according to the policy should be purchased, including all waste products and waste materials. Socialist commercial wholesale institutions should undertake the task of storing commodities for the country: when there is a temporary surplus of commodities, purchase and store these commodities to ensure the smooth progress of industrial and agricultural production and not reduce the scale of production due to the temporary sluggish sales of commodities; when the supply of commodities is temporarily insufficient, supply the stored commodities to the market, and always play the role of a reservoir and regulator, thereby guaranteeing the stability of market prices and supplying the needs of the people's lives. This approach taken by my country's socialist wholesale commerce is completely premised on promoting production, guaranteeing needs, and supporting the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country. It is fundamentally different from the capitalist commercial practice of raising prices to compete for purchases and hoarding when the supply of commodities is insufficient, and dumping at low prices when the supply of commodities is surplus, thereby fueling economic crises.

All socialist commercial workers are not only economic workers, but also political workers. They should first be concerned about the overall situation of the national economy and establish a comprehensive view, and should not only be concerned about the partial interests of their own enterprises and departments. Socialist commerce should implement economic accounting, carefully calculate, save expenses, improve work efficiency, and increase national accumulation. However, the economic accounting of socialist commerce is completely different in nature from the economic accounting of capitalist commerce. The economic accounting of socialist commerce is to achieve social savings, to strive for the high-speed development of national construction, and to further improve people's lives. It represents the interests of all working people; while the economic accounting of capitalist commerce is for capitalists to realize the maximum profit for individuals. Therefore, the economic accounting of socialist commerce should first calculate how to meet the requirements of the entire national economy for commercial work and how to reflect the overall interests of the entire national economy, which is what we usually call "calculating big accounts." Then, on the basis of "calculating big accounts," calculate the small accounts of this department and this enterprise. At any time, small accounts should obey big accounts, the partial should obey the overall, and business measures should obey policy requirements. Only in this way can we correctly unify the relationship between the whole and the part, big accounts and small accounts, and policies and businesses, which is the correct and socialist-natured enterprise economic accounting, and can we avoid the purely business viewpoint and the purely profit viewpoint when implementing economic accounting.

Socialist commercial work is a broad mass movement

My country's socialist commercial work is a broad mass movement under the leadership of the Party and is a component of the vigorous Great Leap Forward movement launched by the people of our country to realize the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Within the commercial sector, there are millions of employees, and it is only possible to do a good job in commercial work by giving full play to their work enthusiasm and pioneering spirit on the basis of constantly improving their revolutionary consciousness and working hard. Outside the commercial sector, there are more than 600 million working people, who are producers and also consumers, and they are closely related to commercial work every day. If we do not rely on the support and supervision of these more than 600 million people, we will also not be able to do a good job in commercial work. Therefore, in the relationship between commercial departments and industrial and agricultural production departments, transportation departments, and other departments, we must constantly advocate socialist cooperation between each other; in the work of purchasing agricultural products, we must always pay attention to relying on the broad masses of farmers to carry out mass movements for selling and transporting agricultural and sideline products; in the work of commodity sales, we should rely as much as possible on the resident masses to reasonably distribute commodities. The mass line is the lifeline of all the Party's work. In my country's commercial work, we must unswervingly implement the Party's mass line.

To implement the Party's mass line in my country's commercial sector, the primary issue is to put politics in command and strengthen the Party's leadership. We must pay attention at all times to improving the communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers and constantly use proletarian ideology to overcome various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies. We should constantly improve the political viewpoints of commercial workers and overcome the purely business viewpoint of emphasizing business and neglecting politics. We should constantly strengthen the production viewpoints of commercial workers so that all commercial workers can understand the political and economic principles that commodity production determines commodity circulation and commodity circulation, in turn, affects commodity production, and constantly strengthen the role of commercial work in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. We should constantly strengthen the mass viewpoints of commercial workers, often pay attention to overcoming certain phenomena of commercial work that are divorced from the masses, so that all measures of commercial work can represent the interests of the broad masses of working people and establish the closest mutual assistance and cooperation relationship between commercial workers and other broad masses of working people.

In all commercial enterprises, we should implement the system of manager responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee and place the political work and economic work of commercial enterprises under the absolute leadership of the Party. Experience has proved that this is the organizational guarantee for all commercial enterprises to unswervingly implement the Party's general line and Party policies. In all commercial enterprises, we should implement the system of two participations and one reform (cadres participate in labor, workers participate in management, and improve business management) or three participations and one reform (cadres participate in labor, workers participate in management, residents participate in supervision or management, and improve business management) under the leadership of the Party. This system is the application and development of the Party's mass line working method in enterprise management work and is a good form of combining leadership and the masses. Relying on the masses and centralized leadership is a complete unity. Under the unified leadership of the Party, workers participating in management and residents participating in supervision or management will not only not weaken centralized leadership, but on the contrary, it will precisely help to better strengthen centralized leadership. This does not mean that there is no need to divide responsibilities and abide by the system within the enterprise. On the contrary, it requires that work discipline and personal responsibility system be better established on the basis of the mass line.

In 1958 and the first half of 1959, commercial work, under the illumination of the Party's general line of socialist construction and the promotion of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, showed a situation of overall Great Leap Forward. Millions of people acted vigorously and carried out an unprecedentedly large-scale Red Flag movement. The development process of the Red Flag movement always starts with a creation or innovation in one place or one thing. After promotion and development, it goes from one job to other jobs, from one aspect to other aspects, and from one unit and one place to many units and many places, gradually converging into a huge trend, and finally involving all commercial workers in the movement. This large-scale Red Flag movement has greatly changed the face of commercial work. The socialist cooperation between commercial departments and industrial and agricultural production departments has been unprecedentedly close, and the service attitude and service quality of commercial workers have been greatly improved. Due to the widespread and in-depth promotion of breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and advocating the communist style of daring to speak, dare to think, and dare to do, countless rationalization proposals and technological innovation measures have appeared in purchasing stations, wholesale stations, retail stores, and warehouses, breaking many unreasonable rules and regulations and establishing new rules and regulations that conform to the actual situation. In this way, mass creativity and innovation have been carried out in all aspects of improving labor organization, simplifying procedures and systems, improving work efficiency, accelerating capital turnover, reducing commodity losses, improving operating techniques, and reducing labor intensity. Workers' political studies, economic knowledge and commodity knowledge studies, cultural studies, workers' creative activities, and workers' amateur cultural activities have also been carried out to varying degrees. As of the end of 1958, more than 600 Red Flag units had emerged in commercial departments across the country. We firmly believe that as long as we continue to adhere to the policy of carrying out mass movements in a big way in the commercial sector, be good at discovering new things, cherish the creativity and innovation of the masses, give full support, help, and cultivate them, and promote them through various methods such as evaluation, inspection, on-site meetings, and exhibitions and visits, we will continue to emancipate the minds of the masses, encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm and pioneering spirit of the masses, and make the movement constantly add new content and develop to a higher stage.

Actively promoting the development and consolidation of people's communes is an important task of commercial work

The people's commune movement is a continuation and development of the great socialist revolution in my country's rural areas. Actively promoting the development and consolidation of people's communes is an important task of commercial work. In 1958 and the first half of 1959, commercial departments tried every means to expand the supply of means of production to people's communes, helped people's communes train many technicians, and helped people's communes set up various small factories such as agricultural tools, pesticides, cement, and ball bearings. Commercial departments actively participated in the work of formulating production plans for people's communes and assisted people's communes in developing diversified operations such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries to develop commodity production, raise production funds for communes, and increase wage income for members. Commercial departments and people's communes and production teams have widely established purchase and sales contracts and organized material exchange meetings to invigorate the rural economy, strengthen the planned nature of commodity production in people's communes, and closely link the state's commodity circulation plan with the production plan of people's communes.

Because the people's communes implement the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers and the unity of government and commune, the commercial institutions in rural areas are both the basic units of state-owned commerce and the components of the people's communes. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee of the people's commune, the relationship between commercial work and agricultural production, with the lives of the masses, and with the various tasks of the commune is closer, making it easier to uniformly arrange labor, rely on the masses, and carry out movements in a big way to complete the tasks of commercial work.

The establishment of people's communes has opened up a broader prospect for the development of commodity production and commodity circulation in our country. Because people's communes have the characteristics of being large in size and high in the degree of public ownership, the pace of agricultural mechanization in our country will be greatly accelerated due to the establishment of people's communes, agricultural production and diversified operations will be

    十年来的商业
    中共中央财政贸易工作部副部长　姚依林
    伟大的中华人民共和国已经成立十周年了。十年来我们国家在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，各方面都取得了极其辉煌的成就，商业工作的成就，也是其中的一部分。中国共产党的社会主义革命的总路线和社会主义建设的总路线，是照耀着我们前进的灯塔，引导我国各方面的工作，其中也包括商业工作，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    从以下三个方面，可以看出十年来我国商业工作发展的面貌：
    第一，十年来我国的商品流通量迅速地扩大了，成倍地增长了。从社会商品零售额的增长情况来看：1950年我国社会商品零售额是一百七十点六亿元，到1952年国民经济恢复的任务完成的时候，增长为二百七十六点八亿元，增加了62％；到1957年第一个五年计划完成的时候，增长为四百七十四点二亿元，比1950年增加了一点八倍。1958年是我国国民经济全面大跃进的一年，这一年社会商品零售额是五百四十八亿元，比1950年增加了二点二倍；1959年继续跃进，社会商品零售额预计是六百一十五亿元，将比1950年增加二点六倍。以上的情况说明，我国社会商品零售额的增长速度是很快的，特别是1958年和1959年，增长的速度更快。这些数字，说明了我国国民经济正在高速度地向前发展；说明了我国人民收入的不断增加和人民生活水平的不断改善；说明了1958年我国国民经济的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进。这些数字，同时也反映了我国商品生产的飞跃发展，反映了我国城乡之间、地区之间、各民族之间物资交流的不断扩大，反映了我国工农联盟和民族团结的日益巩固。
    第二，在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上，对资本主义商业的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利。目前我国的市场，已经成为一个适合于我国情况和人民需要的统一的社会主义市场。社会主义的国营商业和合作社商业，是这个市场的主体，它经营着社会商品的绝大部分，机构遍布全国的城市和乡村。在国营商业和合作社商业以外，还存在着国家领导下的农民贸易市场和通过合作化道路组织起来了的小商贩，作为国营商业和合作社商业的补充。至于公私合营商业，除了资本家还在按照赎买政策领取定息以外，已经和国营商业没有什么区别了。农民贸易市场是不允许投机商贩参加的，农民贸易市场上的商品，是由生产者直接出售的，市场交易是在国家的管理和社会主义经济的领导之下进行的，因此它和资本主义性质的自由市场不同。小商贩已经组织成为合作商店和合作小组，他们主要是代理国家收购和销售某些金额不大但是品种繁多的零星商品，他们在政治上、组织上、商品价格上和服务方式上都接受国家的领导和监督，因此他们也和资本主义性质的小商贩不同。我国的社会主义商业，是一种新型的商业。社会主义商业是为生产服务的，它的一切活动，以有利于生产发展为原则；社会主义商业是为人民生活服务的，它千方百计地满足人民的生活需要。它在本质上和唯利是图的资本主义商业完全不同。只有在社会主义制度之下，我国才第一次出现了完全“为人民服务”为目的的商业。
    第三，我国的社会主义商业，是我国历史上效率最高，费用最省的商业，它在经营管理方面，充分地体现了社会主义制度的优越性。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，社会商品零售额增加了二点六倍，但是社会商业从业人员，不仅没有增加，反而有所减少。1949年，我国社会商业从业人员是六百八十五万人左右，1951年，曾一度到达九百万人左右，但1958年，已经降低到六百四十万人左右。商品流转费用也是逐年下降的。我国社会主义商业在经营管理上获得巨大进步的原因，是由于坚决地执行了毛泽东同志提出的勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的方针；是由于坚决地执行了毛泽东同志提出的群众路线的工作方法，发挥了广大群众的积极性和创造性。特别是1958年大跃进以来，群众路线的工作方法在商业部门有了进一步的发展。社会主义制度具有高度的计划性和组织性，能够把商品生产和商品流通纳入计划，合理地组织商品运输，大大地节省了人力物力。由于社会主义制度消灭了资本主义商业的自由竞争和无政府状态，从而简化了商品流转环节，减少了不必要的商业从业人员，降低了商品包装费用和广告宣传费用。由于社会主义制度消灭了资本主义商业的私人所有制，因此有可能按照生产的布局和人民生活的需要，全盘地调整和安排商业网，充分发挥各种设备的使用效率，提高每个商业从业人员的劳动效率。
    社会主义性质的国营商业和合作社商业，是贯彻执行党的社会主义革命的总路线的一个重要武器
    在社会主义革命过程中，社会主义性质的国营商业和合作社商业，是执行党对资本主义工商业的利用、限制、改造政策，贯彻执行党的社会主义革命的总路线的一个重要武器。
    在城市方面，社会主义商业对资本主义工业采取了加工订货统购包销的方法，供给原料，收购成品，把资本主义工业纳入国家资本主义的轨道。在采取了这种方法以后，国家一方面可以正确地利用资本主义工业的生产能力，生产商品，供应人民的需要；另一方面又可以切断资本主义工业在原料收购和成品销售方面同市场的直接联系，使资本主义工业处于国家的限制之下，防止他们在市场上囤积居奇，兴风作浪，捞取暴利。同时，社会主义商业还可以通过这种方法，支持资本主义工业中的工人运动，团结、教育与改造资本家，为进一步实行资本主义工业的公私合营准备条件。
    在农村方面，社会主义商业通过对农村市场的管理，统一收购重要农产品，对粮食、油料等主要农产品实行计划收购和计划供应即统购统销等方法，有力地打击了投机商人，限制了农村中资本主义自发势力的发展，支持了农业合作化运动；并且通过工业品和农产品的交换，扩大了城乡物资交流，促进了农业和副业生产的发展。
    由于社会主义商业在城市和农村两方面同时进行了以上的工作，就使国家逐步掌握了一切重要的农产品和一切重要的工业品的货源；使社会主义批发商业逐步地完全代替城乡资本主义的批发商业；使社会主义零售商业有所发展；使国家有可能按照规定的具体条件，把商品批发给私营零售商，让他们执行经销代销的业务；使社会主义商业有可能把作为个体商业劳动者的城乡小商贩组织起来，成为合作商店和合作小组，引导他们走上合作化的道路。所有这一切，都为资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营准备了条件。
    在社会主义改造过程中，社会主义商业同资本主义工商业以及农村资本主义自发势力之间的斗争，是一场尖锐的、复杂的阶级斗争。1955年秋冬，农业合作化高潮最后地断绝了资本主义在农村发展的道路，根本改变了我国阶级力量的对比，资本主义工商业实行了全行业公私合营，我国在经济战线上的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。经过1957年的整风运动和反右派斗争，我国在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。但是，阶级斗争并没有最后终结。在社会主义改造过程中，社会主义商业吸收了大批资本主义的批发商和零售商，参加了工作，这些人还在根据赎买政策领取着定息，他们的资本主义思想在社会主义商业中不可能不经常发生腐蚀作用。吸收到社会主义商业中工作或者组成合作商店、合作小组的小商贩，虽然他们是个体的商业劳动者，他们中间的多数人拥护社会主义制度，但是由于他们在旧社会长期从事商业活动，其中有一部分人也深深地沾染了资本主义思想。因此，阶级斗争，特别是思想领域中的阶级斗争，在商业部门中今后还须要长时期地反复地进行。正如刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中所说的：“在整个过渡时期，也就是说，在社会主义社会建成以前，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，始终是我国内部的主要矛盾。”只是在目前我国的具体条件下，这个矛盾除了在某些时候表现为敌我矛盾以外，在大多数情况下表现为人民内部的矛盾，一般地都应当按照整风去加以解决。
    商业工作的基本任务是：一方面为生产服务，一方面为消费服务
    在社会主义建设过程中，社会主义商业在整个国民经济中起着极为重要的作用。工业产品中的消费品和一部分生产资料（其中主要是农业生产资料），农业产品中的商品部分，都要经过社会主义商业收购、调拨、分配给工业生产部门、农村人民公社和广大的消费群众。许多出口商品，需要由商业部门向对外贸易部门组织供应。许多进口商品，需要由商业部门组织内销。商业是生产部门和生产部门之间、生产和消费之间的纽带，是城乡之间、工农之间的桥梁。马克思列宁主义的政治经济学告诉我们：生产、交换、分配、消费是统一的，其中起决定作用的是生产。生产决定着交换、分配和消费，但是交换、分配和消费反过来也在一定程度上影响生产。生产是出发点，消费是终点。交换和分配是生产到消费的中介。政治经济学的这些原理，决定了商业工作的基本任务：一方面为生产服务，一方面为消费服务。
    商业工作的一切措施，必须有利于促进生产的发展。一切商业工作人员都应当经常了解工农业生产的情况，十分关心工农业生产的发展。当工业部门和农村人民公社需要生产资料的时候，商业部门就应当积极地组织生产资料的供应，尽可能满足生产部门的需要。当工业部门和农村人民公社需要出售工农业产品的时候，商业部门就应当积极地进行收购，正确地组织分配销售工作，使生产部门能够及时地进行再生产和扩大再生产。在工业原料不足或者农业遇到灾害的时候，商业部门就应当尽一切可能去帮助他们克服困难，增加生产。商业工作是和工农业生产同命运、共呼吸的，生产不发展，不可能扩大商品流通。但是，反过来说，如果商业工作做得好，可以促进生产的发展，如果商业工作做得不好，也会对生产发生不利的影响。因此，商业工作对于生产决不是被动的、消极的，而是具有积极的能动作用的。今年上半年，市场零星商品曾经一度供应不足，商业部门在各级党委的领导下，召开了全国的、省的、市的、专区的、县的和人民公社的各级零星商品物资交流会，大大推动了城乡零星商品的生产，逐步满足了市场的需要。这就是商业工作对于促进生产发展具有积极作用的一个例证。
    商业工作的一切措施，必须有利于满足人民的生活需要。发展生产的目的，正是为了满足需要。商业部门应当正确地做好商品分配工作，力求做到分配合理，节省消费者购买商品的时间，使消费者感到便利。当商品生产还不能充分满足人民的生活需要的时候，商业部门应当十分注意合理地分配商品；当人民的生活需要发生了变化的时候，商业部门应当及时地按照需要组织生产，并且正确地指导消费。当商品的质量不能保持应有水平的时候，商业部门应当积极协助生产部门提高商品质量。一切商业部门，都应当不断地提高服务质量，改进服务态度，尽可能使消费者感到满意。
    为了正确地执行党的商业政策，发动群众完成商业工作的任务，必须把商业工作置于党的绝对领导之下。各级商业部门必须服从同级党委的领导，必须围绕着党委决定的中心任务，去完成商业工作本身的任务。鉴于对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利，党中央在1957年决定对商业工作实行统一领导、分级管理的办法，把大部分权限，下放给各级党委去管理，取消了专业公司的系统。1958年商业工作大跃进的经验证明了这个决定是正确的。集中和分散是对立的统一，下放商业工作的大部分管理权限，并不是意味着可以不要统一领导和必要的集中管理。我国的商业是社会主义的商业，具有高度的计划性，因此，重大的商业政策和管理制度必须有全国统一的准则，重要的商品必须由国家统一分配，重要商品的价格必须由国家统一规定。只有把集中和分散正确地结合起来，才能既有利于保证全国商业计划的统一性，又有利于发挥地方和广大群众的积极性。近十年来，我国市场物价基本上是稳定的
    稳定物价是党的一项重要政策，是商业工作的一项重要任务。自从1950年3月国家采取了稳定物价的措施以来，将近十年，我国的市场物价是基本稳定的。全国批发物价指数如以1950年3月为一百，1958年只有九十二点七；北京、上海、天津、沈阳、广州、西安、武汉、重庆八大城市的零售物价指数，如以1950年3月为一百，1958年只有一百零一点四。这种物价稳定的情况，为我国工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善，创造了极为有利的条件。正如刘少奇同志在中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第一次会议的报告所说的：“全国解放以前，我国经过了十二年严重的通货膨胀，物价经常波动。解放以后，针对这种情况，党的基本方针是稳定物价。这就是说，不管当时某些物价是否合理，首先使各种物价在当时的水平上稳定下来，而在稳定以后，再对某些十分不合理的价格进行若干调整。党的这个基本方针是正确的，执行这个方针的结果是成功的，它对我国工业农业生产的发展起了有益的促进作用。”
    稳定物价，并不是使所有的商品价格都固定不变，并不是不调整个别商品的价格。十年来，在保持物价水平基本稳定的前提下，我们不断地运用了价值规律的作用，对个别商品的价格进行调整，有的降低，有的提高，使物价政策有利于促进生产的发展。自从1950年3月以来，国家对农产品的收购价格是有所提高的，而工农业产品在市场上的出卖价格，就总水平来说，则是基本稳定的，工业农业产品之间的比价是逐步缩小的。农民用同样的农产品，可以比过去换到更多的工业品。从不同的地区来看，交通方便的沿海地区工业品价格基本稳定并且略有降低，农产品价格略有提高；边远、偏僻地区的工业品价格则降低得比较多，农产品价格也提高得比较多。实行这种办法的目的，是为了照顾到逐步提高边远、偏僻地区的人民生活。
    通过商业环节，做好粮食合理分配工作，对于改善我国粮食供应情况，具有重要作用
    十年来，在粮食战线上，我们取得了伟大的胜利。粮食产量有了很大的提高。1949年，我国粮食产量是二千一百六十二亿斤，按全国人口平均，每人不到四百斤；1958年，我国的粮食产量是五千亿斤，按全国人口平均，每人接近八百斤。十年间粮食总产量增加了近一倍半，按全国人口平均，每人增加了将近一倍，这种增长速度在世界上是少见的。特别是1958年一年中，粮食总产量由1957年的三千七百亿斤增加到五千亿斤，增加了35％，更是空前未有的大跃进。由于粮食产量的提高，使我国的粮食供应状况有了很大的改善。但是，我国粮食问题是不是已经彻底解决了呢？还没有。要解决人吃、牲畜吃、储备等各方面的需要，要大大增加肉类、奶类的供应量以提高人民的生活水平，每人每年平均八百斤粮食，显然是不够的，还需要经过一个较长时间的努力，才有可能使我国的粮食产量，充分地满足我国人民一切方面的需要。解决我国粮食问题的关键，在于进一步提高我国粮食的产量，在于早日实现农业机械化。
    在我国粮食问题还没有彻底解决以前，通过商业环节，做好粮食的合理分配工作，对于改善我国的粮食供应情况，具有重要的作用。即使在粮食问题彻底解决了以后，也还须要十分重视粮食的分配工作。从1953年开始实行粮食统购统销制度以来，实践证明，这一制度不仅有力地配合了农业合作化运动和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，而且有力地支援了社会主义工业化建设，保障了市场物价和人民生活的稳定。我国的粮食统购统销制度，有两个主要特点：第一，国家向农民收购粮食，是根据等价交换的原则进行的。国家参照我国历史上的粮食价格水平，参照粮食与工业品之间的合理比价，制定了粮食收购价格，保证了农民出售粮食以后，能够得到应有的货币收入。国家在农村销售粮食的价格，只是按照收购价格加上经营费用、保管损耗和税金，销售价格只比收购价格高8％，而且，不论收购价格和销售价格，都是全年不变。这种价格政策，对于农民来说，是完全公平合理的，同资本主义制度下私商经营粮食的时候，秋后压价收购，春季抬价出售，季节差价很大的剥削农民的办法，是完全不同的。第二，国家采取了计划供应的方法，不仅全面地安排了城市的粮食需要，而且也全面地安排了农村的粮食需要。国家向农民收购粮食，是在全面地安排了全体农民的粮食需要的基础之上进行的。国家根据不同地区的粮食生产和消费状况，经过农民的讨论和同意，核定了每个地区农民的粮食合理消费量。对于有余粮的农民，首先让他们留下自用的口粮、种籽和饲料，然后把余粮的大部分卖给国家；对于一切缺粮的农民，国家合理地供应他们所缺的粮食。七年来，党的粮食统购统销政策，受到了城乡广大劳动人民的拥护。我国是一个大国，每年总有一些地方发生自然灾害，影响到农作物的收成。自从实行粮食统购统销政策以后，国家保证了灾区人民能够按照国家规定的价格得到必要的粮食供应，使灾区人民的生产情绪保持稳定，生产建设继续进行。这和我国历史上发生灾荒的时候，人民四处逃荒、卖儿卖女、田园荒芜、饿殍载道的情况相比，是一个鲜明的对照，在这个问题上充分地证明了社会主义制度的优越性。
  鼓足干劲，多产粮食，是彻底解决我国粮食问题的根本办法。为了鼓励农民增产粮食的积极性，我国在农村中实行了粮食定产、定购、定销的政策。这就是说，按照农村中的正常年景，确定粮食的产量，确定国家统购粮食的数量和统销粮食的数量，几年不变。在这几年里，实际产量超过了定产的部分，国家只增购一小部分，其余大部分归农民自用。这个办法，受到了各地人民公社和生产队的拥护。在粮食问题上，除了增产粮食以外，精打细算，省吃俭用，节约粮食也是一条重要的政策。决不能生产多少粮食就消费多少粮食，一定要瞻前顾后，以丰补歉，细水长流，留有余地，学会过好日子，逐步地增加国家的、人民公社的和农户个人的粮食储备。
    某些商品供不应求的根本原因是：生产增长的速度跟不上人民需要增长的速度。只要坚持党的总路线，这些暂时困难定能逐一克服
    十年来，在我国社会生活中有时遇到一种现象，这就是某些商品供不应求。在品种上，有时是某些副食品，有时是某些日用工业品；有时是这几种，有时是那几种。发生这种现象的根本原因，是我国某些商品生产增长的速度跟不上人民需要增长的速度。我国商品生产增长的速度是很快的。1949年全国社会零售的商品猪只有两千五百万头，到1958年已经增加到四千二百万头。1949年全国的棉纱产量只有一百八十万件，棉布产量只有十九亿米；到1958年，全国的棉纱产量已经达到六百一十万件，棉布产量已经达到五十七亿米。1949年全国只生产化学肥料二万七千吨，到1958年已经生产八十一万吨；1952年全国只生产农用药剂一万五千吨，到1958年已经生产八万二千吨。在短短的十来年中间，像我国的商品生产这样的一倍、几倍、甚至几十倍的增长，在我国历史上是从来没有过的。但是，尽管商品生产增长得快，仍然有时出现某些商品供不应求的现象。这是由于旧社会遗留下来的失业现象，在我国已经完全消灭；就业的职工人数，比解放前增加了四倍多；农民的生活水平，比解放前已经有了很大的提高。在国家高速度地进行工业建设的条件下，在全国人民生活水平迅速提高的情况下，在国民经济的旧的平衡被突破，新的平衡正在建立的过程中，在一个时期内，发生某些商品供不应求的现象，是毫不足怪的。难道这不正是反映了我国国民经济蓬勃地向前发展的兴旺气象吗？拿我国的这种现象，同资本主义制度下面商品堆积如山，但是广大劳动人民却没有钱去购买商品的那种凄凄惨惨的现象相对比，难道不是恰恰可以证明社会主义制度根本不会像资本主义制度那样出现经济危机吗？十年来我国有时遇到的某些商品供不应求的困难，是前进中、发展中的暂时困难。只要我们坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，坚持国民经济高速度发展，在优先发展重工业的前提下坚持工业农业生产同时并举、重工业轻工业生产同时并举等一整套两条腿走路的方针，这些困难是一定会逐一克服的。
    商业部门须要经常计算社会商品购买力的增长情况，经常计算社会商品供应量是否与购买力的需求相适应，经常与工农业生产部门密切协作，促进生产的发展，力求组织更多的商品货源来供应人民的需要。在对工业品、农产品的收购工作中，应当把一切按照政策应当收购和可以收购得到的商品都收购起来，包括一切废品废料在内。社会主义的商业批发机构，应当担负为国家储备商品的任务：在商品一时有余的时候，把这些商品收购起来，储备起来，保证工农业生产的顺利进行，不至于因为商品的一时滞销而缩减生产规模；在商品一时供应不足的时候，把储备起来的商品供应市场，经常地起到蓄水池和调节器的作用，从而保证市场物价的稳定和供应人民生活的需要。我国社会主义批发商业所采取的这种做法，是完全以促进生产、保证需要、支持我国的社会主义建设高速度发展为前提的。它与资本主义商业在商品供应不足的时候，抬价争购，囤积居奇，在商品供应有余的时候，低价倾销，从而助长经济危机的做法是根本不同的。
    一切社会主义商业工作者，不仅是经济工作者，而且是政治工作者。应当首先关心全国国民经济的大局，树立起全面观点，而不应当仅仅关心本企业、本部门的局部利益。社会主义商业是应当实行经济核算的，应当精打细算，节省开支，提高工作效率，增加国家积累。但是社会主义商业的经济核算同资本主义商业的经济核算在性质上完全不同。社会主义商业实行经济核算，是为了实现社会的节约，为了争取国家建设的高速度发展，为了进一步改善人民生活，它代表着全体劳动人民的利益；而资本主义商业的经济核算，则是为了资本家个人实现最大限度的利润。因此，社会主义商业的经济核算，应当首先计算如何满足整个国民经济对商业工作的要求，如何体现整个国民经济的全盘利益，也就是我们通常所说的“算大账”。然后，在“算大账”的基础上，再来计算本部门、本企业的小账。在任何时候，小账都是应当服从大账的，局部都是应当服从全局的，业务措施都是应当服从政策要求的。只有这样，才能把全体与局部、大账与小账、政策与业务的关系正确地统一起来，才是正确的、社会主义性质的企业经济核算，才能避免实行经济核算时的单纯业务观点和单纯利润观点。
    社会主义的商业工作，是一个广泛的群众运动
    我国的社会主义商业工作，是在党的领导下的一个广泛的群众运动，是我国人民为了实现党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线而掀起的轰轰烈烈的大跃进运动的一个组成部分。在商业部门内部，有几百万从业人员，必须在不断提高革命觉悟的基础上，高度地发挥他们的工作积极性和首创精神，埋头苦干，才有可能做好商业工作。在商业部门以外，有六亿多广大劳动人民，他们是生产者，同时也是消费者，他们每天与商业工作发生密切的联系。如果不去依靠这六亿多人民的支持和监督，也同样不能把商业工作做好。因此，在商业部门与工农业生产部门、交通运输部门以及其他部门的关系上，必须不断地提倡相互间的社会主义协作；在农产品收购工作中必须经常注意依靠广大农民群众，开展出售和运输农副产品的群众运动；在商品销售工作中应当尽可能地依靠居民群众合理分配商品。群众路线是党的一切工作的生命线，在我国商业工作中，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行党的群众路线。
    在我国商业部门中贯彻执行党的群众路线，首要的问题是实行政治挂帅，加强党的领导。必须时时刻刻注意提高广大职工群众的共产主义觉悟，不断地以无产阶级思想去克服各色各样的资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想。应当不断地提高商业工作者的政治观点，克服重业务、轻政治的单纯业务观点。应当不断地加强商业工作者的生产观点，使全体商业工作者都能懂得商品生产决定商品流通，商品流通反过来又影响商品生产的政治经济学原理，不断地加强商业工作促进工农业生产发展的作用。应当不断地加强商业工作者的群众观点，经常注意克服商业工作中某些脱离群众的现象，使商业工作的一切措施，都能代表广大劳动人民的利益，使商业工作者同其他广大劳动人民，建立起最密切的互助合作关系。
    在一切商业企业中，都应当实行党委领导下的经理负责制，把商业企业的政治工作和经济工作，放在党的绝对领导之下。经验证明，这是一切商业企业坚定不移地贯彻执行党的总路线、党的政策的组织保证。在一切商业企业中，都应当在党的领导下，实行两参一改（干部参加劳动、职工参加管理、改善经营管理）或三参一改（干部参加劳动、职工参加管理、居民参加监督或管理、改善经营管理）的制度。这种制度，是党的群众路线的工作方法在企业管理工作中的运用和发展，是一种领导和群众相结合的很好的形式。依靠群众和集中领导是一个完整的统一体。在党的统一领导下，职工参加管理，居民参加监督或管理，不仅不会削弱集中领导，相反地，它恰恰有利于更好地加强集中领导。这也不是说企业内部用不着划分职责和遵守制度了，相反地它要求在群众路线的基础上更好地建立起工作纪律和个人负责制。
    1958年和1959年上半年，商业工作在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进的推动下，出现了一个全面大跃进的局面，几百万人轰轰烈烈地行动起来，开展了规模空前巨大的红旗运动。红旗运动的发展过程，总是从一处一事的创举或革新开始，经过推广、发展，由一项工作到其他工作，由一个方面到其他方面，由一个单位、一个地方到许多单位、许多地方，逐渐汇集成为洪大的潮流，最后把全体商业工作者都卷入到运动中去。这个规模巨大的红旗运动大大地改变了商业工作的面貌。商业部门与工农业生产部门之间的社会主义协作空前地密切了，商业工作人员的服务态度与服务质量大大提高了。由于广泛深入地提倡了破除迷信、解放思想，提倡了敢说敢想敢做的共产主义风格，在采购站、批发站、零售商店和仓库里出现了无数的合理化建议和技术革新措施，破除了许多不合理的规章制度，建立了新的合乎实际情况的规章制度。这样，就在改进劳动组织、简化手续制度、提高工作效率、加速资金周转、降低商品损耗、改进操作技术、减低劳动强度等各个方面，进行了群众性的创造和革新。职工的政治学习、经济知识和商品知识的学习、文化学习，职工的创作活动，职工的业余文化活动，也在不同的程度上有所开展。截至1958年底，全国各地的商业部门，已经涌现了六百多个红旗单位。我们深信，只要继续坚持在商业部门中大搞群众运动的方针，善于发现新的事物，珍视群众的创造和革新，给予充分的支持、帮助、培养，并且通过评比、检查、现场会议、展览参观等各种方法加以推广，就会不断地解放群众的思想，鼓舞群众的革命积极性和首创精神，使运动不断地增加新的内容，向更高的阶段发展。
    积极促进人民公社的发展和巩固，是商业工作的重要任务
    人民公社运动是我国农村中伟大的社会主义革命的继续和发展。积极促进人民公社的发展和巩固，是商业工作的重要任务。1958年和1959年上半年，商业部门千方百计地扩大了对人民公社的生产资料供应，帮助人民公社训练了许多技术人员，帮助人民公社兴办了农具、农药、水泥、滚珠轴承等各种小型工厂。商业部门积极参与了人民公社制定生产规划的工作，协助人民公社发展农林牧副渔等多种经营，以发展商品生产，为公社筹措生产资金，使社员增加工资收入。商业部门和人民公社、生产队广泛地建立了购销合同，组织了物资交流会，以活跃农村经济，加强人民公社商品生产的计划性，使国家的商品流通计划和人民公社的生产计划紧密地衔接起来。
    由于人民公社实行工农商学兵的相互结合和政社合一，在农村的商业机构，既是国营商业的基层单位，又是人民公社的组成部分。在人民公社党委的统一领导下，商业工作同农业生产、同群众生活、同公社的各项工作的关系更加密切，更加便于统一安排劳动力，依靠群众，大搞运动，完成商业工作的任务。
    人民公社的建立，为我国的商品生产和商品流通的发展，开拓了更加广阔的前景。由于人民公社具有一大二公的特点，我国农业机械化的步伐将因人民公社的建立而大为加快，农业生产和多种经营将获得迅速的发展，农民的生活水平将会不断提高，所有这一切，都为扩大农副产品的采购，扩大日用工业品的销售，扩大生产资料的供应，提供了极为有利的条件。瞻望着我们社会主义祖国的伟大前途，我们感到无限光明，无比兴奋。
    十年来，我国的社会主义商业在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，获得了伟大的成就，胜利地完成了党和人民交付给我们的任务。所有这些成就，应当首先归功于党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导，同时也是和全体商业工作者的积极工作，和广大群众对商业工作的有力支持，和我们认真地学习了苏联商业的先进经验分不开的。苏联商业是最先进的商业。它的一切先进经验，不论过去、现在和将来，都是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    当然，我国商业战线的广大职工并不满足于已经取得的成就。我们知道，我国现在还是一个“一穷二白”的国家，要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国，还有一段长期的艰巨的路程。我们必须在十年来已经取得胜利的基础上继续跃进。最近，全国商业战线的广大职工，正在学习和贯彻党的八届八中全会的决议，反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起新的增产节约高潮，争取在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，用新的成绩来庆祝伟大的建国十周年。我们深信，在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的商业工作，在前进的道路上，一定会不断地取得新的胜利。
