Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: Washington News - After some people in India, using the Sino-Indian border issue as a pretext, stirred up a new wave of opposition to China, the US ruling clique became very interested, taking the opportunity to wantonly slander China and trying its best to win over India, attempting to provoke and completely destroy Sino-Indian relations.

After Nehru made the unreasonable accusation of the so-called "Chinese troops invading the Indian border" in the Indian People's House on August 28th, the Associated Press immediately sent a message from Washington on the same day, saying that Nehru's speech made US officials "extremely interested in India's foreign policy," believing that "this is exactly what Washington has always been unable to persuade them to do." US officials hoped that it "may prompt New Delhi's policy to be more inclined to support the (Western) free world."

On the same day, White House Press Secretary Hagerty, who was with US President Eisenhower on a visit to Britain, told reporters in London that "the US government will try to obtain further intelligence on this issue (the Sino-Indian border incident)." The news revealed that Eisenhower had discussed the issue with Macmillan in Britain and with De Gaulle in France. On the evening of September 1st, Eisenhower also met with Indian High Commissioner to Britain, Mrs. Pandit. The Associated Press reported that Indian sources in London said that Eisenhower told Mrs. Pandit in the meeting that he had been paying attention to recent developments in India. Mrs. Pandit left Britain the day after this meeting to return to New Delhi.

Senior US government officials and members of Congress openly incited India to oppose China and blatantly stated that the US would take action. US Vice President Nixon publicly slandered "Communist China's aggression against Laos and India" on August 31st, and also slandered the Soviet Union for supporting China's "aggression" against these two countries. He clamored that the US "has no other way but to aid the free governments under attack." However, in order to avoid direct intervention that would backfire, Nixon wanted the Indian government to first make a request, and then the US should "take action" on the Indian border incident at the request of the Indian government. US Secretary of the Navy William Frank showed an eager attitude, clamoring at a press conference on September 2nd that the US "has not increased naval forces there because of the dispute in the Indian region, but nearby US forces can take action immediately." He also said that the US Navy is in "excellent state of readiness," and "the Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific can be redeployed if needed." A group of members of Congress, such as Mansfield and Javits, shouted that the United Nations should "take action" on this issue. Senator Cooper advocated that "India should first (raise this issue to the United Nations)." Cooper was concerned that "intervention by the US or other Western countries at this time" would only "complicate" the issue.

US Congressmen and the bourgeois press used the Sino-Indian border incident to vigorously slander China, viciously provoking the relationship between India and the people of Asian countries and the Chinese people. Former US Ambassador to India, Congressman Bowles, and others vigorously rendered the Sino-Indian border incident as "serious" and "of broad and important significance, far beyond an explanation that this is merely a small border conflict." Bowles even nonsensically said that "China cannot feed 650 million people, so the Chinese are watching the rich land to the south," and currently China "is taking tentative actions in a region of India." Some US newspapers blatantly demanded that India change its peaceful and neutral foreign policy. The "World Telegram and Sun" openly said, "If India can be made to recognize this fact in modern political life (abandoning its neutrality), it may be beneficial to the entire free world." The "New York Times," surrounding the meeting between Pakistani President Ayub and Nehru on September 1st, published consecutive editorials saying that India should recognize that "signing a defense agreement with Pakistan" has "many benefits." The "American" even said that the Sino-Indian border incident shows the "terrible price paid by India for neutrality," and "will at least prompt Mr. Nehru to consider joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." Senators Wiley, Representatives Keith, and Judd, among others, used the so-called "Communist China's aggressive expansionism" and "the Communist plan to create incidents in Southeast Asia" to intimidate Asian countries, and to make the "entire South Asia and Southeast Asia region pay attention."

Xinhua News Agency, September 10th: London News - On the issue of the Sino-Indian border incident, the British ruling clique is doing its utmost to sow discord. The British government openly issued a statement viciously slandering China. The British bourgeois press is also working hard to fan the flames in these incidents.

When discussing the Sino-Indian border incident on September 3rd, a British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government "opposes and condemns the kind of actions taken by China as reported, which are inconsistent with their repeated claims of 'peaceful coexistence'," and "the Indian government will undoubtedly take the steps it deems appropriate."

On the 3rd, the British official British Information Services specially sent a message from London, directly slandering China for "invading other countries." The British Information Services also said, "In view of the recent developments on the Sino-Indian border, the words of Communist China's Foreign Minister Marshal Chen Yi that his country never invades other countries are unacceptable."

When Indian Prime Minister Nehru insisted that the McMahon Line was a "recognized border line" between China and India, a British Foreign Office spokesman also stated on August 26th that the British government "considers the McMahon Line to be the border line between India and Tibet." The so-called McMahon Line was unilaterally forcibly drawn by British imperialists, who had long engaged in armed aggression against the Tibet region of China, in March 1914 behind the backs of the representatives of the then Chinese central government, and no Chinese central government has ever recognized this line.

In order to incite the national sentiment of the Indian people and provoke relations between other Asian countries and China, the British "Daily Telegraph" fabricated the news of the so-called Chinese government launching a "propaganda campaign to liberate Sikkim and Bhutan," and then some newspapers followed suit and vigorously rendered it. The "Hindustan Times" reprinted this report on August 13th, and the Indian People's League member of parliament immediately raised a temporary motion in the People's House on the same day regarding the so-called Chinese "serious threat to Indian security." British newspapers, along with some right-wing Indian newspapers, spread another sensational rumor, saying that China "intends to establish a Himalayan Federation composed of Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, etc." On August 12th, the British "Manchester Guardian" also recklessly said that "the Chinese have begun to carry out intimidation on the borders of Sikkim, Bhutan, and Nepal. The Chinese are concentrating troops on the border. The Chinese leaders in Tibet have been making speeches demanding Sikkim and Bhutan." On the 29th, the British "Daily Mail" even pretentiously fabricated a rumor that its reporter "heard" Beijing claiming control of "radio propaganda" in Bhutan, Sikkim, and other places. However, in early September, the heads of government of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim successively declared, denying these shameless rumors. Prior to this, Prime Minister Nehru also said in the Indian People's House on August 28th that he did not think that there was any Chinese army invading Bhutan or Sikkim.

Many British newspapers continuously published Nehru's speeches in the Indian Parliament and reports from these newspapers' correspondents in India in prominent positions on the front page, rendering a "serious crisis on the Sino-Indian border." These newspapers, on the one hand, vigorously spread all kinds of rumors of so-called "Chinese aggression against India" and "Chinese military threat to its southern neighbors," and on the other hand, used this to viciously slander China. Many newspapers insidiously incited India to take further anti-China actions. They also greatly attacked the policy of peace and neutrality, demanding that India change its foreign policy.

    恶毒诬蔑我国　挑拨中印关系
    美英乘机推波助澜
    企图拉拢印度并煽动印度加紧反华活动
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：印度的一些人借口中印边界问题掀起新的反对中国的浪潮以后，美国统治集团大感兴趣，乘机大肆诬蔑中国，并竭力笼络印度，试图挑拨和彻底破坏中印关系。
    尼赫鲁8月28日在印度人民院提出所谓中国军队“侵犯印度边界”这一无理的指责后，美联社当天便从华盛顿发出一条消息说，尼赫鲁这个讲话使美国官员们“对印度的外交政策发生了极大的兴趣”，认为“这正是华盛顿向来无法劝得他们这样做的”。美国官员们指望“可能促使新德里的政策更倾向于支持（西方）自由世界”。
    同一天，随美国总统艾森豪威尔在英国访问的白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂，在伦敦对新闻记者说，“美国政府将设法获得关于（印中边境事件）这个问题的进一步情报”。消息透露，艾森豪威尔在英国同麦克米伦以及在法国同戴高乐的会谈中，都曾经讨论了这个问题。9月1日晚，艾森豪威尔还同印度驻英国高级专员潘迪特夫人会谈。美联社报道，在伦敦的印度人士说，艾森豪威尔在会谈中对潘迪特夫人说，他一直在注意着最近印度的事态发展。潘迪特夫人在这次会谈后的第二天离开英国返新德里。
    美国的高级政府官员和国会议员等更公开煽动印度反对中国，并露骨地表示美国将采取行动。美国副总统尼克松在8月31日公开诬蔑“共产党中国侵略老挝和印度”，还诬蔑苏联支持中国对这两个国家的“侵略”。他叫嚣美国“没有其他办法，只有援助受到攻击的自由政府”。但是为了避免直接干涉反而败事，尼克松要印度政府首先提出要求，然后美国应印度政府的要求，就印度边境事件“采取行动”。美国海军部长威廉·弗兰克更表现出跃跃欲试的姿态，他9月2日在记者招待会上叫嚣说，美国“没有因为印度地区的纠纷而增派海军部队到那里去，但是，附近的美国部队能够立即采取行动”。他还说，美国海军处于“极好的戒备状态”之中，“在西太平洋的第七舰队如果需要能够重新部署”。一批国会议员如曼斯菲尔德、杰维茨等，则叫喊联合国应在这个问题上“采取行动”。参议员库柏主张，“应该由印度首先（向联合国）提出这个问题”。库柏顾忌“美国或其他西方国家在这个时候干涉”只会使问题“复杂化”。
    美国国会议员和资产阶级报刊利用中印边境事件竭力诬蔑中国，恶毒地挑拨印度和亚洲国家人民同中国人民间的关系。前美国驻印度大使、众议员鲍尔斯等，大力渲染印中边境事件是“严重的”，“有广泛的和重要的意义，远远超过说这仅仅是边境小冲突这样一种解释”。鲍尔斯竟然胡说“中国不能养活六亿五千万人，因此中国人注视着南面的富饶的土地”，目前中国“正在印度的一个地区采取试探的行动”。美国的一些报纸十分露骨地要求印度改变和平中立外交政策。“世界电讯与太阳报”公开说，“如果使得印度认识现代政治生活中的这个事实（放弃它的中立），那对整个自由世界可能是有好处的”。“纽约时报”环绕着巴基斯坦总统阿尤布9月1日同尼赫鲁的会谈，接连发表社论说，印度应该认识到“同巴基斯坦签订防御协定”有“许多好处”。“美国人报”甚至说什么，印中边境事件表明印度为“中立付出的可怕代价”，“至少将促使尼赫鲁先生要考虑参加东南亚条约组织的问题”。参议员维利、众议员凯斯、周以德等，更以所谓“共产党中国的侵略成性的扩张主义”、“共产党打算在东南亚制造事故的计划”，来恫吓亚洲国家，要“整个南亚和东南亚地区都开始注意”。
    据新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：在中印边境事件问题上，英国统治集团竭尽挑拨离间之能事。英国政府公然发表恶毒诬蔑中国的声明。英国资产阶级报刊也在这些事件中大卖力气，煽风点火。
    英国外交部发言人9月3日在谈论中印边境事件问题时说，英国政府“反对而且谴责像所传的中国所采取的那种行动，那种行动同他们再三重申的‘和平共处’的论调是矛盾的”，“印度政府无疑将采取它认为是适当的步骤”。
    3日，英国官方的英国新闻处专门从伦敦发出一条消息，直接诬蔑中国“侵犯别国”。英国新闻处并说，“鉴于最近中印边境的事态发展，共产党中国外交部长陈毅元帅所说的他的国家从不侵犯别国的话是难以接受的”。
    在印度总理尼赫鲁硬说麦克马洪线是中印间“得到承认的边界线”的时候，英国外交部发言人8月26日也表示，英国政府“认为麦克马洪线是印度和西藏之间的国境线”。而所谓麦克马洪线正是长期武装侵略中国西藏地区的英帝国主义者在1914年3月背着当时的中国中央政府代表片面强行划出的，历来中国任何中央政府都没有承认过这条线。
    为了煽动印度人民的民族情绪，挑拨其他亚洲国家同中国的关系，英国“每日电讯报”凭空捏造了所谓中国政府发动“解放锡金和不丹的宣传运动”的消息，然后一些报纸跟着大肆渲染。“印度斯坦时报”在8月13日转载了这条报道，印度人民同盟议员当天便在人民院提出了所谓中国“对印度安全的严重威胁”的临时动议。英国报纸还同印度一些右翼报纸一道，散播出另一个耸人听闻的谣言，说中国“打算建立由尼泊尔、锡金、不丹等组成的喜马拉雅联邦”。8月12日，英国“曼彻斯特卫报”又信口雌黄地说什么，“中国人开始在锡金、不丹、尼泊尔边界上进行恐吓。中国人在边界上集中军队。在西藏的中国首要人物一直在发表演说，要索取锡金和不丹”。29日，英国“每日邮报”更煞有介事地造谣说，它的记者“听见”北京声称要控制不丹、锡金等地的“广播宣传”。但是，在9月初，尼泊尔、不丹、锡金三国政府的负责人先后声明，否认了这些无耻的谣言。在此以前，尼赫鲁总理也于8月28日在印度人民院说，他认为并没有什么中国军队侵入不丹或者锡金的事情。
    英国许多报纸并连续在第一版以显著地位刊登尼赫鲁在印度议会中的发言和这些报纸驻印度记者的报道，渲染“中印边境的严重危机”。这些报纸一面大肆散播所谓“中国侵略印度”、“中国武力威胁南面邻国”的形形色色的谣言，一面以此来恶毒诽谤中国。不少报纸阴险地煽动印度进一步采取反华行动。它们并且大事攻击和平中立政策，要求印度改变外交政策。
