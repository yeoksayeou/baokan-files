    How I Conduct Language Teaching in Chinese Class
    Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School, Shi Yanxing
    Many Chinese teachers are troubled by the lack of accuracy, vividness, and liveliness in their students' language. I used to be troubled by this as well. Later, I explored some methods in my work, and now I am willing to offer some immature practices and superficial experiences for discussion with my comrades.
    We Cannot Neglect Language Teaching
    For a period of time, I neglected language teaching: when discussing literary works, I liked to analyze the characters' personalities from a theoretical perspective, which in practice turned living characters into withered skeletons; when discussing political essays, I liked to add a large number of examples, which in practice used examples to cover up the original work's logical persuasiveness. However, I glossed over the most basic material of literary works—language. Of course, this could not improve students' ability to understand and use language through classroom teaching.
    In practice, I gradually realized that: if we want to make students' language accurate, vivid, and lively, we must first help them understand and master others' accurate, vivid, and lively language; if we want to effectively improve students' ideological level and writing ability through Chinese teaching, we must also base it on helping them thoroughly understand the language of the works. Therefore, I paid more attention to language teaching.
    Words Should Not Be Separated from Sentences, and Sentences Should Not Be Separated from the Text
    I believe that in the senior grades of middle school, language teaching should not separate words from sentences, nor sentences from the text. That is, we should help students grasp the content of the works through word meaning explanations and sentence pattern analysis; and we should also explain word meanings and analyze sentence patterns by focusing on the content of the works. The two should complement each other and supplement each other, and word teaching should not be separated from the explanation or analysis of the text, let alone separating language form from ideological content.
    Language teaching should also be based on the actual situation of the teaching materials and students, focusing on the key words and sentences of the works for detailed analysis, rather than using force evenly and blurring the focus.
    To facilitate explaining the problem, I would like to give an example of the preparation and teaching of the fourth natural paragraph in "The Bourgeois Orientation of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized."
    When studying the teaching materials, I deeply understood the spiritual essence of the editorial in connection with the anti-rightist struggle. The editorial helped me further recognize the ugly nature of the rightists and aroused hatred for the enemy. Specifically, when studying this paragraph, I gradually grasped that its main content was to expose the serious crimes of the Democratic League rightists in attacking the Party, thereby further shattering the deception of the "Wenhui Daily" editorial department's false self-criticism at that time. The dialectical argumentation level, especially the long sentence "Those who stir up trouble... are the so-called bourgeois rightists," vividly exposed the reactionary nature of the enemy and had a strong appeal.
    I also considered in more detail that: for my students, although the content of this paragraph is not difficult to understand, the argumentation level is not easy to grasp; although the words are not too difficult to understand, the momentum, emotion, and combat power of the language are difficult to appreciate. Therefore, I decided to focus on analyzing the above long sentence on the basis of helping students grasp the argumentation level of this paragraph, in order to help students recognize the ugliness of the rightists and improve their ability to understand and use language.
  Correctly Understand the Content of the Text
      Slowly Bring Out the Power of Language
    This paragraph was taught in the second class period of the whole lesson. In the first class period, the historical background was briefly introduced, the text was read aloud, and students were asked to preview the text. When analyzing this paragraph in the second class period, I first used a series of questions to help students understand it, revealing the ugly nature of the rightists in three levels: first, exposing the crimes of the Democratic League and the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in attacking the Party in an organized, planned, and programmatic way; then, explaining that bourgeois rightists actually only accounted for a small number of people, and further exposing the crimes of the rightists; then, explaining that although the number of right-wing backbones was small, they did a lot of evil and could not be ignored. The dialectical connection between the three levels accurately revealed the essence of the enemy.
    Then I further asked: Which language in this paragraph most vividly and profoundly exposed the crimes of the rightists in attacking the Party? Students clearly answered: "Those who stir up trouble... are the bourgeois rightists." I affirmed the students' answers and pointed out: Although this long sentence is meant to explain that there are only a small number of rightists "like this," the noun phrase in its subject part vividly and profoundly exposes the enemy. Then, I simply explained and analyzed this passage by focusing on the rightists' attack on the Party:
  "Those who stir up trouble" expose the ugly state of the rightists who fear that the world will not be in chaos and who create monsters; "Either plotting in secret rooms or igniting fire at the grassroots level" exposes the ghostly conspiracy tricks; "Connecting up and down, responding in all directions" exposes the organized and planned frantic attack on the Party; "Taking the world into chaos, replacing it, gradually implementing it, and finally achieving great success as the estimate of the situation and the ultimate goal" exposes the arrogant ambition to overthrow the Party's leadership and restore the bourgeoisie. Then, I pointed out that these languages are progressively deepened and vividly exposed the enemy's ugly nature and serious crimes.
    After helping the students initially understand the content of this passage, I further asked: What kind of sentence pattern did the editorial use in this passage? And I recited the original text for the students, intentionally emphasizing the linguistic momentum of the antithesis and arrangement of phrases during recitation, in order to stimulate their thinking activities. On the basis of the students' answers, I pointed out: The editorial used many phrases in the subject part of this long sentence; "Those who stir up trouble" and "Either plotting in secret rooms" and "igniting fire at the grassroots level"... are all antithetical sentences; and pairs of antithetical sentences constitute an arrangement sentence pattern; This antithetical arrangement of phrases constitutes a very rapid and powerful language momentum.
    Then I asked the students about the artistic effect produced by this kind of language. After enlightenment, the students also made some analysis. I made the following analysis on the basis of the students' answers: This rapid and powerful language not only exposes the enemy's frantic and fierce attack on the Party, but also embodies the people's righteous anger and merciless whipping of the rightists; it is like a series of continuously fired shells, each hitting the enemy's vital point, making the enemy's true form exposed and nowhere to hide; it has a strong appeal and combat power, arousing our hatred for the enemy and igniting our anger to fight against the enemy. It is pointed out that this is a model of the perfect combination of artistry and high political nature. In this way, the formal characteristics of this passage were helped to be understood by the students by focusing on content.
      Using the Method of Comparison
    In order to help the students appreciate the artistic charm of this passage and understand the unified relationship between content and form, I also used the method of comparison. After reading "Those who stir up trouble, either plotting in secret rooms" again, I changed "igniting fire at the grassroots level" to "Sometimes go to grassroots units to stir up trouble," and asked the students to consider how the change was made. The answers were all negative. I further pointed out: Although the meaning is still the same after this change, the power is weakened a lot because it destroys the antithetical arrangement of phrase sentence pattern; From this, we can appreciate the unified relationship between content and form. To write a good article, it is important to have a correct position and ideological feelings first, but the cultivation of language is also very important.
    In this way, starting from the language to analyze the works, I think it not only helps the students understand the role of antithetical arrangement sentence patterns and the great power of this passage, improves their ability to understand and use language; but also helps them further recognize the crimes of the rightists and carry out class education. Later, the students reflected that they felt that this passage was very powerful and that the rightists were indeed hateful, and the effect was relatively good.
    When teaching novels, poetry, and other types of works, I also strive to analyze the artistic conception and life scenes in the works and the personality, situation, and mood of the characters on the basis of thorough explanation and analysis of the original language.
    Prevent Mechanical Use of Other People
      Sentences or Piling Up of Words
    While paying attention to language teaching, I also paid attention to preventing students from mechanically using other people's sentences or piling up words. After analyzing the long sentence in "The Bourgeois Orientation of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized" mentioned earlier, I pointed out to the students: The reason why such an article can be written is not only because the author of the editorial has a high level of language cultivation, but also because the author has infinite loyalty to the Party and the people's cause, strong hatred for the enemy, and profound observation and analysis of the enemy's crimes; we must comprehensively learn from the author of the editorial. Language is closely related to content, and it is good to use it properly, but it is not good to use it improperly. Leaving aside specific language conditions, it is difficult to abstractly say whether language is good or bad, so never pursue rhetoric or play with skills. In order to correct their understanding of language.
    The content of language teaching is very broad, and teaching phonetics, words and phrases, and systematically teaching grammar and rhetoric knowledge are all important components of it. These will not be discussed in this short article.

    我怎样在语文课中进行语言教学
    北京师大附中　时雁行
    不少语文老师为学生语言的不够准确、鲜明、生动而感到苦恼。我也曾经这样苦恼过。后来在工作当中进行了一些摸索，现在愿意把一些不成熟的作法和肤浅的体会提出来和同志们共同商榷。
    不能忽视语言教学
    我曾有一段时间忽视语言教学：讲文学作品好从理论上分析人物性格，实际是把活生生的人物讲成干瘪的几条筋；讲政论文章好大量补充实例，实际是用事例掩盖了原作的逻辑说服力。而对文学作品的最基本的材料——语言，却一掠而过。这样当然不能从课文教学当中提高同学们理解和运用语言的能力。
    在实践中我逐渐认识到：要想使学生的语言准确、鲜明、生动，首先要帮助他们理解和掌握别人的准确、鲜明、生动的语言；要想通过语文教学切实地提高学生的思想水平和写作能力，也必须以帮助他们透彻地理解作品的语言为基础。因而比较重视了语言教学。
    词不离句、句不离文
    我认为在中学的高年级中，进行语言教学应该词不离句，句不离文。也就是既要通过词义解释、句式分析来帮助同学们掌握作品的内容；又要扣住作品的内容来解释词义、分析句式。要使二者相辅相成，互为补充，而不应把词语教学游离于讲解或分析课文之外，更不应把语言形式和思想内容割裂开来。
    进行语言教学还要根据教材和学生的实际情况，抓住作品的关键词句来着重分析，而不应平均使用力量，模糊重点。
    为了便于说明问题，我想举准备和讲授“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”中的自然段第四段的情况为例。
    在钻研教材时，我联系反右斗争的情况深入体会社论的精神实质。社论使我进一步认清了右派分子的丑恶本质，激起了对敌人的憎恨。具体到钻研这一段，我逐步掌握了它的主要内容在于揭露民盟右派向党进攻的严重罪行，从而进一步粉碎当时的“文汇报”编辑部假检讨的欺骗。而辩证的论述层次，尤其是“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪……就是所谓资产阶级右派人物”这个长句，更淋漓尽致地揭露了敌人的反动本质，具有强烈感染力。
    我又比较细致地考虑到：对我的学生来说，本段的内容虽不难理解，但论述层次却不易掌握；词语虽不太难懂，但语言的气势感情和战斗力量却难于体会。因而决定在帮助学生掌握本段论述层次基础上，着重分析上述长句，以帮助同学认识右派分子的丑恶，提高理解和运用语言的能力。
  正确理解课文内容
      慢慢引出语言的力量
    这一段是在全课的第二课时讲授的。在第一课时曾简要地介绍了时代背景，朗读了课文，并要求学生预习课文。在第二课时分析这一段时，我先用一系列问题帮助学生理解它，分三个层次揭发了右派分子的丑恶本质：先揭出民盟、农工两个党有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线地向党进攻的罪行；然后说明资产阶级右派分子到底只有较少人数，同时进一步揭露右派罪行；然后说明右翼骨干人数虽少，作恶却相当大，不可忽视。三个层次之间体现着辩证的关联，准确地揭露了敌人的实质。
    接着我又进一步提问：本段那些语言最形象深刻地揭露了右派分子向党进攻的罪行？同学们很明确地回答出：“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪……就是资产阶级右派人物”这个长句。我肯定了学生的回答，并且指出：这个长句虽然在于说明像“这样”的右派分子只有较少人数，它的主语部分的名词性短语却非常形象深刻地揭露了敌人。然后简单地扣住右派向党进攻的情况解释分析这一段话：
  “呼风唤雨，推涛作浪”揭露右派分子惟恐天下不乱，兴妖作怪的丑态；“或策划于密室，或点火于基层”，揭露鬼鬼祟祟的阴谋伎俩；“上下串连，八方呼应”揭露有组织有计划地向党猖狂进攻；“以天下大乱、取而代之、逐步实行、终成大业为时局估计和最终目的”揭露图谋推翻党的领导，使资产阶级复辟的狂妄野心。接着指出，这些语言递进深入，淋漓尽致地揭露了敌人的丑恶本质和严重罪行。
    在帮助学生初步理解了这段话的内容以后，我又进一步提问：社论在这一段话中运用了什么样的句式？并且为学生背了一下原文，在背诵时有意强调对偶和排列短语的语言气势，以启发他们的思维活动。我在学生回答的基础上指出：社论在这一长句的主语部分，使用了很多短语；“呼风唤雨”和“推涛作浪”，“或策划于密室”和“或点火于基层”……都是对偶句；而且一对对的对偶句又构成了排列句式；这对偶排列的短语就构成了非常急促有力的语势。
    接着我又提问学生这种语言所产生的艺术效果。经过启发，同学们也作了一些分析，我在学生回答基础上作了如下的分析：这种语势急促有力的语言，既揭露了敌人向党进攻的猖狂凶恶，又体现着人民对右派分子的正义的愤怒和无情的鞭挞；它像一颗颗连发炮弹，弹弹击中敌人要害，使敌人原形毕露，无处躲藏；它具有强烈的感染力和战斗力，唤起我们对敌人的憎恨，燃烧起我们对敌斗争的怒火。指出这是完美艺术性和高度政治性相结合的典范。这样，又扣住内容帮助同学理解了这段话的形式特点。
      运用比较的方法
    为了帮助同学们很好地体会这段话的艺术魅力，让他们理解内容和形式的统一关系，我又使用了比较的方法。在又读了“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪，或策划于密室”以后，我把“或点火于基层”改读为“有时到基层单位去煽风点火”，让学生考虑改的怎样。回答都是否定的。我进一步指出：这样改后虽然意思还是一样，但因破坏了对偶排列的短语句式，力量就不知削弱了多少；由此可以体会到内容和形式的统一关系，要写好文章固然先要有正确的立场和思想感情，但语言的修养也是非常重要的。
    这样从语言出发分析作品，我觉得既帮助同学们理解了对偶排列句式的作用和这一段话的巨大力量，提高了他们理解和运用语言的能力；也帮助他们进一步认清了右派分子的罪行，进行了阶级教育。后来同学们反映：觉得这段话很有力量，看到右派分子的确可恨，效果是比较好的。
    在讲授小说、诗歌等类作品时，我也力求在讲解分析透彻原作语言的基础上，分析作品中的意境和生活图景，分析人物的性格和处境心情。
    防止机械搬用别人
      语句或堆砌词藻
    在注意语言教学的同时，我还注意了防止学生发生机械搬用别人语句或堆砌词藻的偏向。在分析完前面所谈的“文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判”中的长句以后，我向学生指出：所以能写出这样的文章，既因为社论作者有高度的语言修养，更因为作者对党对人民事业的无限忠诚，对敌人的强烈憎恨和对敌人罪行的深刻观察分析；我们必须全面地向社论作者进行学习。语言是和内容密切联系着的，用得恰当就好，用得不恰当就不好。离开特定的语言条件，很难抽象地说语言的好坏，因而千万不要追求词藻，玩弄技巧。以端正他们对语言的认识。
    语言教学的内容非常广泛，像语音、字词教学以及系统地讲授语法修辞知识都是它重要的组成部分。在这篇短文中就不谈这些了。
