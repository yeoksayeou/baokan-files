Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 14th: At the fourth enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) yesterday afternoon, held to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue, speakers unanimously supported the solemn stance of our government on handling the Sino-Indian border issue, expressed great indignation at the anti-China wave stirred up by Indian reactionaries and the Indian army's occupation of our territory, and hoped that the Indian government would return to the position of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through peaceful consultation.

Wen Minsheng, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said that the current tense situation on the Sino-Indian border was entirely created by the Indian side and should be entirely the responsibility of the Indian side. The only correct way to ease this situation is for the Indian authorities to withdraw their troops and administrative personnel who have invaded our territory and to stop the anti-China clamor of the reactionaries in India. The Indian authorities' imposition of various pressures on the Chinese government, even the use of force, will only complicate the situation further and will not lead to good results.

Xiao Xuyi, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said that the so-called McMahon Line is a product of Britain's aggressive policy towards China's Tibet region, and no central government in China has ever recognized it. Now, the Indian government insists that this illegal boundary line is the boundary line between China and India and attempts to impose its unilateral claims on our country, which the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate.

Xu Chongqing, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), in his speech, refuted Prime Minister Nehru's logic that the McMahon Line happened to have an "advantage" because it was a "clear watershed." He said that if this strange logic were to hold, then any country could use the same "reason" to take the territory of another country as its own border.

Guo Dihuo, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), said that the Indian government's demand that our country accept the illegal McMahon Line as the national border has nothing in common with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As one of the founders of the Five Principles, Prime Minister Nehru has taken a tolerant attitude towards the Indian army's invasion of our border and the recent new anti-China wave in India, which we find very surprising and indignant.

Chen Nengxing, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said that the Chinese people do not invade the territory of others, but they also firmly do not allow others to invade our territory. We resolutely oppose the imperialist conspiracy to sow discord between China and India, and hope that the Indian government will return to the position of the Five Principles, immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border, and ease the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border in order to safeguard Sino-Indian friendship and the cause of peace.

Hong Long, Deputy Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that we have always shown great restraint and patience regarding the recent unfriendly incidents towards our country in India, but this does not mean that we are weak and can be bullied. We solemnly warn the people with ulterior motives in India that your frenzied anti-China activities are bound to fail.

Zhou Wanru, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Women's Federation, said: Since the Indian reactionaries provoked the Sino-Indian border dispute, the imperialists have applauded and tried their best to sow discord between the friendly relations between the people of China and India. This shows that the unfriendly behavior of the Indian government towards China is only beneficial to the imperialists, and is very detrimental to the people of China and India, who have just been liberated from imperialist oppression.

Sha Mengbi, Director of the Guangzhou Islamic Association, who visited India in 1955, said that four years ago, when he visited India with the Chinese Islamic Hajj delegation, he heard Indian people shouting "Indian and Chinese people are brothers" everywhere, which fully demonstrates that maintaining Sino-Indian friendship is the common aspiration of the people of the two countries. Now some right-wing people in India are using the Sino-Indian border issue to launch a new anti-China movement, once again attempting to sow discord between the friendly relations between the people of China and India, which violates the will of the Indian people and is therefore bound to fail.

Other members who spoke at the meeting also unanimously condemned the anti-China clamor of the Indian reactionaries and hoped that Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government would value Sino-Indian friendship and adopt a wise policy to resolve the disputes between the two countries through peaceful consultation.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 14th: The Shaanxi Provincial Committee and the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPPCC held a meeting today to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue. Responsible persons of the regional organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations unanimously supported and firmly supported the resolution of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Sino-Indian border issue and Premier Zhou's report, angrily condemning the Indian army for invading our sacred territory and some people with ulterior motives in India for inciting a new anti-China movement. The participants unanimously pointed out: The Indian government should take prompt measures to immediately withdraw the troops and administrative personnel who have invaded our territory, immediately stop the anti-China clamor, and immediately conduct peaceful and friendly negotiations with our country in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Sun Weiru, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said that the Indian side wants to force our country to recognize the product of British imperialism's implementation of aggressive policies towards our Tibet region—the "McMahon Line." Anyone with a slightly sober mind will understand that this is absolutely unacceptable to the 600 million Chinese people.

Han Wangchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), said: We solemnly warn Mr. Nehru, do not make mistakes again and again. Recently, the imperialists have been taking advantage of the Sino-Indian border issue to muddy the waters and sow discord between the two countries, attempting to lead India to participate in military blocs. The Indian army's invasion of our territory and the anti-China clamor in Indian political circles are making those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice. Isn't this enough to arouse Mr. Nehru's deep thought?

Fu Jiaojin, a famous geography expert and professor at Northwest University who had been to the Sino-Indian border, cited many geographical materials to prove that the so-called McMahon Line is completely illegal. He pointed out that world maps such as Stieler's world map and Meyer's world map in Germany, the world atlas published by the Japanese Geographical Association and the Newly Selected Atlas published by the Teikoku Shoin, the world map published by the French Paris Geographical Society, and even the famous Oxford map of Britain and the most popular Bartholomew world map in Britain, all have the same delineation of the Sino-Indian border as our country's maps.

Lang Zhao, Standing Director of the Buddhist Association of China and Buddhist monk, Wu Shalang, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Li Puzhao, Deputy Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation, Hua Qi, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP), Chen Daxie, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Branch of the Jiusan Society and Professor of Jiaotong University, and Tian Jingfu, Chairman of the Xi'an Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously warned the Indian government that it must restore its sanity. Any fantasy of invading our territory is in vain and will not bring them any good results.

    广东和陕西各界人士正告印度政府
    通过协商解决中印边界问题
    印度反动派的疯狂反华活动肯定是要失败的
    新华社广州14日电　政协广东省委常务委员会昨天下午为讨论中印边界问题举行的第四次扩大会议上，发言的人一致拥护我国政府关于处理中印边界问题的严正立场，对印度反动派掀起反华浪潮和印度军队侵占我国领土的行为表示极大的愤慨，并希望印度政府回到和平共处五项原则的立场上来，通过和平协商的办法来解决中印边界问题。
    政协广东省委员会副主席文敏生说，目前中印边境的紧张局势完全是由印度方面一手制造的，应该完全由印度方面负责。缓和这种局势的唯一正确途径，就是印度当局撤回侵入我国领土的军队和行政人员，并制止印度国内反动派的反华叫嚣。印度当局对中国政府施加种种压力甚至使用武力威胁，只会使局势更加复杂化，是不会得到好结果的。
    民革广东省委副主任委员萧嶲英说，所谓麦克马洪线是英国对我国西藏地方执行侵略政策的产物，我国任何中央政府从来没有承认过。现在印度政府坚持这条非法的界线是中印两国的边界线，并企图把自己的片面主张强加于我国，这是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    民盟广东省委主任委员许崇清在发言中，驳斥了尼赫鲁总理所谓麦克马洪线恰巧有一个“优点”，因为它是一个“明确的分水岭”的逻辑。他说，这种奇怪的逻辑如果成立的话，那么随便某一个国家也可以以同样的“理由”把别国的领土作为自己的国境线了。
    民建广东省委员会主任委员郭棣活说，印度政府要我国接受非法的麦克马洪线作为国境线，这与和平共处五项原则毫无共同之处。作为五项原则创始人之一的尼赫鲁总理，对印军侵略我国边境和最近印度国内掀起的新的反华浪潮，竟然采取纵容的态度，我们对此感到非常惊奇和愤慨。
    广东省总工会主席陈能兴说，中国人民不侵犯别人领土，但也坚决不允许别人侵犯我国的领土。我们坚决反对帝国主义挑拨中印关系的阴谋，希望印度政府回到五项原则的立场上来，立即撤回越境印军和行政人员，使中印边境的紧张局势缓和下来，以维护中印友谊与和平事业。
    共青团广东省委副书记洪龙说，对于最近印度方面发生的对我国的不友好的事件，我们一直表现了极大的克制和忍耐，但是这并不是软弱可欺。我们严正警告印度别有用心的人们，你们这种疯狂的反华活动是肯定要失败的。
    广东省妇女联合会主任周婉如说：自从印度反动派挑起了中印边界纠纷以来，帝国主义就拍手称快，尽力挑拨中印两国人民的友好关系，这说明了印度政府对中国所采取的不友好的行为只有利于帝国主义，对于刚从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的中印两国人民是十分不利的。
    曾在1955年到过印度的广州伊斯兰教协会主任沙梦弼说，四年前，当他随中国伊斯兰教朝觐团访问印度时，到处听到印度人民衷心地高呼“印度中国人民是兄弟”，这充分说明维护中印友谊是两国人民的共同愿望。现在印度一些右派人士利用中印边界问题掀起新的反华运动，再一次企图挑拨中印两国人民的友好关系，这违背了印度人民的意志，因此肯定是要失败的。
    在会上发言的其他委员们也一致谴责印度反动派的反华叫嚷，并希望尼赫鲁总理和印度政府以中印友谊为重，采取明智的政策，通过和平协商来解决两国的纷争。
    新华社西安14日电　政协陕西省委员会和西安市委员会今天举行会议，讨论中印边界问题。各民主党派地区组织和各人民团体负责人在会上一致拥护并坚决支持全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于中印边界问题的决议和周总理的报告，愤怒谴责印度军队侵犯我国神圣领土，和印度一些别有用心的人煽动新的反华运动。与会者一致指出：印度政府应该迅速采取措施，立即撤出侵犯我国领土的军队和行政人员，立即停止反华叫嚣，立即根据和平共处五项原则，同我国进行和平友好的谈判。
    中国国民党革命委员会陕西省委员会主任委员孙蔚如说，印度方面要强迫我国承认英帝国主义对我国西藏地方执行侵略政策的产物——“麦克马洪线”，头脑稍微清醒的人都会明白，这是六亿的中国人民绝不能接受的。
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员、中国民主建国会西安市委员会主任委员韩望尘说：我们正告尼赫鲁先生，不要一错再错，最近帝国主义借口中印边界问题混水摸鱼，挑拨两国关系，企图把印度引到参加军事集团的道路上去，而印度军队侵入我国领土和印度政界的反华叫嚣，正使亲者痛、仇者快，这难道还不足以引起尼赫鲁先生的深思吗？
    曾经到过中印边界的著名地理专家、西北大学教授傅角今引用许多地理资料，来证实所谓麦克马洪线完全是非法的。他指出，像德国的斯蒂勒世界图和迈尔代世界地图，日本地理协会出版的世界图帖和帝国书院出版的新选大地图集，法国巴黎地理协会出版的世界地图，连英国有名的牛津地图和英国最流行的巴沙罗缪世界地图，对中印边界也都同我国的地图划法一样。
    中国佛教协会常务理事、佛教法师朗照，陕西省总工会副主席吴沙浪，陕西省妇女联合会副主任李普昭，中国农工民主党西安市委员会副主任委员华起，九三学社西安分社副主任委员、交通大学教授陈大燮，西安市基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席田景福等都在会上发言，他们一致警告印度政府必须恢复理智，任何侵略我国领土的幻想都是枉费心机，都不会给他们带来什么好结果。
