Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 1st dispatch: The Japan-China Friendship Association's Ninth National Convention closed on August 31st.

　　The resolution passed by the convention regarding opposition to the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" stated: "Revising the Security Treaty will perpetuate the state of war that still exists between Japan and China, creating many difficulties for the friendship and restoration of diplomatic relations desired by the people of both countries. Therefore, we must work closely with people of all strata to fight against the revision and abrogation of this treaty, so as to achieve peace in Asia and the independence of Japan."

　　Another resolution passed by the convention regarding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations and the launch of a people's movement to celebrate China's National Day stated that the Friendship Association will strive to make the movement successful within the movement's executive committee, composed of sixty-one groups. The resolution also stated that the Friendship Association will reinvestigate the Liu Lianren incident, collect the names of Chinese victims, and hold exhibitions, lectures, and film screenings to let the Japanese people know the truth about the People's Republic of China, especially regarding China's policies of seeking peace and friendship.

　　The meeting also decided to erect a Lu Xun memorial in the campus of Tohoku University in Sendai, where Lu Xun once studied.

　　The association's action program for this year, passed by the convention, pointed out that it is necessary to learn from the aggressive war launched by Japanese militarism against China in the past and not to fight against the Chinese people. The action program stipulates the development of activities demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government change its hostile policy toward China and strive to eliminate obstacles in the path of restoring diplomatic relations with China.

　　The action program calls for comprehensive joint action with other organizations to oppose the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　The action program also calls for promoting cooperation between people of all strata and the association, expanding the association itself, and improving the work of the association's central and local organs so that they can fulfill important tasks.

　　The convention decided to revise the association's charter. According to the decision made by the convention, the provisions of "promote the restoration of (Japan-China) diplomatic relations" and "eliminate obstacles hindering the restoration of relations" were added to the objectives and activities section of the association's charter.

　　The meeting also passed a letter to the Chinese people, expressing heartfelt and friendly congratulations to the Chinese people as the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China approaches. The letter stated that China's development in the past ten years has been a greater encouragement to the Japanese people striving to defend peace than anything else. The letter also expressed the determination to strive to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and establish formal relations with China.

　　The convention re-elected Jiichiro Matsumoto as the president of the Japan-China Friendship Association; elected as vice presidents were Kanzo Uchiyama, Natsu Kawasaki, Yoshitaro Hirano, Kaoru Ota, Fukutaro Tamura, and Kazuo Mishima.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 31st dispatch: At the closing meeting of its three-day Second National Congress today, the All Japan Farmers Association Federation passed a resolution stating that Japanese farmers will unite with workers to launch a struggle to crush the U.S.-Japan military collusion and prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" until they can ensure Japan's peace, democracy, and independence.

　　The resolution stated that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will drag Japan into the U.S. Far East strategic system, fuel the revival of Japanese militarism, return to enmity with China and the Soviet Union, and make the work of restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations more difficult. At the same time, after the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," more farmland will be requisitioned and reduce agricultural and forestry income due to the expansion of military bases.

　　The action program passed at the congress pointed out that establishing large farmers' associations under the leadership of organized workers is one of the most important tasks at present. The program emphasized the need to further strengthen the alliance with workers, and pointed out that this is the experience gained in the past year in the struggle to demand that the government increase rice purchase prices.

　　The action program demands that the Nobusuke Kishi government adopt a peaceful policy, stabilize the prices of agricultural products, stop importing foreign agricultural products, and reduce taxes.

　　The letter to Japanese farmers passed by the congress called on all Japanese farmers to join the All Japan Farmers Association Federation in order to jointly launch actions to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" together with the workers. The meeting elected new leadership bodies, with Masaru Nozoe, Tokuji Kameda, and Hayato Inatomi serving as chairman, vice-chairman, and secretary-general, respectively.

    反对“安全条约”恢复日中邦交
    全日本农民协会号召农工联合反对日美“安全条约”
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会第九次全国大会在8月31日闭幕。
    大会通过的关于反对修改日美“安全条约”的决议说：“修改安全条约将使日本和中国之间依然存在的战争状态永久化，为两国人民所希望的友好和恢复外交关系制造许多困难。因此，我们要同各阶层人民紧密合作，为阻止修改和废除这项条约而斗争，这样才能取得亚洲的和平和日本的独立。”
    大会通过的另一项关于恢复日中邦交和发起庆祝中国国庆的人民运动的决议说，友好协会将在由六十一个团体组成的运动执行委员会里努力使运动成功。决议还说，友好协会将重新调查刘连仁事件，收集中国受害者的名单，同时，将举办展览会、演讲会和放映电影，以便让日本人民知道中华人民共和国的真相，特别是关于中国的谋求和平和友好的政策。
    会议还决定在鲁迅曾经在那里学习过的仙台东北大学的校园里建立鲁迅纪念碑。
    大会通过的协会的今年行动纲领指出，必须从日本军国主义过去对中国发动的侵略战争中吸取教训，而不同中国人民作战。行动纲领规定展开要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策的活动，争取消除同中国恢复外交关系道路上的障碍。
    行动纲领号召同其他组织采取全面的联合行动，来反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    行动纲领还要求促进各阶层人民同协会的合作，扩大协会本身，并且改进协会中央和地方机构的工作，以便能够履行重大的任务。
    大会决定修改协会章程。根据大会作出的决定，在协会章程的目标和活动部分，增加了“促进恢复（日中）外交关系”和“消除阻挠恢复关系的障碍”的规定。
    会议还通过了给中国人民的一封信，在中华人民共和国建国十周年即将到来的时候向中国人民表示衷心的和友好的祝贺。信中说，中国在这十年内的发展对为保卫和平而努力的日本人民来说，比任何别的事物具有更大的鼓励作用。这封信还表示了为阻止修改日美“安全条约”和同中国建立正式关系而进行努力的决心。
    大会重新选举松本治一郎为日中友好协会会长；当选为副会长的是内山完造、河崎夏、平野义太郎、太田熏、田村福太郎和三岛一。
    新华社31日讯　东京消息：全日本农民协会联合会今天在为期三天的第二届全国代表大会闭幕会议上通过的决议说，日本农民将同工人们联合起来，展开粉碎美日军事勾结、阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争，直到能够确保日本的和平、民主、独立的时候为止。
    决议说，修改日美“安全条约”将把日本拉入美国的远东战略体制，助长日本军国主义的复活，重新以中苏为敌，并且使恢复日中邦交的工作更难进行。同时，修改日美“安全条约”以后，还将由于军事基地的扩大，而使更多农田被征用，减少农林业的收入。
    大会上通过的行动纲领指出，在有组织的工人领导下成立一些大的农民协会，是当前最重要的任务之一。纲领强调需要进一步加强同工人的联盟，并且指出，这是过去一年来在要求政府提高大米收购价格的斗争中所得出的经验。
    行动纲领要求岸信介政府采取和平政策，稳定农产品的价格，停止输入外国的农产品，降低捐税。
    大会通过的告日本农民书呼吁日本全体农民参加到全日本农民协会联合会中来，以便同工人们一起，共同展开阻止修改日美“安全条约”的行动。会议选出了新的领导机构，野沟胜、龟田得治和稻富棱人分别担任会长、副会长和书记长。
