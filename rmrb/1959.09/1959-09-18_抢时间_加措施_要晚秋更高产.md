On-the-Spot Conference: Observe, Compare, Learn, and Discuss
Xinghua Launches a Campaign to Protect Seedlings, Grains, and Cotton Bolls

(Reported by our newspaper) The Xinghua County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an on-the-spot conference in the Zhouhuang and Qianhu production brigades of the Tangliu People's Commune. Through the methods of observing, comparing, learning, and discussing, the committee shattered right-leaning conservatism and inspired revolutionary drive, setting off a new upsurge in autumn production throughout the county.

Zhouhuang Brigade and Qianhu Brigade are adjacent to each other, field by field. In terms of conditions, Qianhu is slightly better than Zhouhuang; but in terms of production, Qianhu is much worse than Zhouhuang.

This year, although each laborer in Zhouhuang Brigade is responsible for 4.7 mu of land, and each of the twelve windmills is responsible for 158 mu of land, plus the river area is small and there is little fertile mud, the 150 mu of early rice that the entire brigade has already harvested has a yield of over 600 jin per mu, an increase of 30% over last year. The middle rice has large and numerous ears, and its growth surpasses that of the early rice. There is not a single plot of third-class seedlings of late rice. Visitors said: "Zhouhuang's production is truly a complete success."

Qianhu Brigade has been a red flag team every year since the cooperativization. Each laborer in the entire brigade is responsible for 4.5 mu of land, there are thirty windmills, each responsible for 66 mu of land, the river area is large, and there are many sources of fertilizer. However, the 180 mu of early rice that the entire brigade has threshed and dried has a yield of only 400 jin per mu, the same as last year. The middle rice has few and small ears. There are 71 mu of third-class seedlings in the 251 mu of late rice, and more than 100 mu of land is dehydrated. Visitors said: "Qianhu's production is very poor."

Why is it that the conditions of these two brigades are basically the same, but the production is so different? The visiting county and commune Party secretaries, based on the information presented, conducted special research in a factual manner. Everyone believed that the main reason was that one side strives for the top, maintains sufficient drive, and specifically looks for advanced teams that are stronger than itself as its competition target; the other side is content to be in the middle, lacks drive, and is satisfied that it is better than backward teams.

From the branch secretary to the team cadres, Zhouhuang Brigade has a very strong desire to strive for the top and catch up with the advanced. Branch Secretary Han Ximing and the small team cadres often visit advanced brigades. When rushing to harvest early rice and rush-planting late autumn crops, Han Ximing saw that the carrots of the Heyao Brigade were planted faster and better than his own, so he immediately arranged for labor to plant more than 80 mu in one go. Usually, the brigade Party branch often speaks to the members about the general line and the Great Leap Forward, mobilizing the masses to boost their morale and strive for the top. All team cadres took the lead in production and carried out mass-based competition and evaluation activities in the fields, launching single-item surprise attacks in stages.

This year, Qianhu Brigade is different. The team cadres said: "This year, it would be good if we can achieve this level." In the competition, they do not compare with Zhouhuang Brigade, which has the same conditions, but compare with Zhaijia Brigade, which has worse conditions than themselves, thinking that they will never fall behind Zhaijia. There are no detailed plans for daily work, and the labor attendance rate is often only about 50%. As a result, the middle and late rice was planted five days later than Zhouhuang Brigade.

The commune Party secretaries who participated in the on-the-spot conference made a specific analysis of the current situation and a specific ranking of the crop growth in their respective areas. Everyone believed that the county's 1.13 million mu of middle and late rice and 200,000 mu of cotton are the "main tasks" of the year's production. The current growth has not yet been determined, and there is still great potential for increased production. The key is to recognize the situation, boost morale, and seize the current twenty days. The measures are: to attack the four barriers of water, insects, fertilizer, and weeds, and to carry out the four-guarantee campaign of protecting seedlings, protecting ears, protecting grains, and protecting cotton bolls. Strive to eliminate low-yield fields below 400 jin, and increase grain production by 70 to 100 million jin and cotton production by 1.5 to 2 million jin on the basis of the original targets. Vigorously rush to plant late autumn crops, with an average of 500 jin, 800 jin, and 1,000 jin of carrots per person in different regions, and an increase of 15 yuan per person in sideline income.

After the on-the-spot meeting, the whole county launched a mass movement, and a vigorous new upsurge in production quickly unfolded in various places. Zhouhuang Brigade of Tangliu Commune gave all the late rice a top dressing of fertilizer in three days. The cadres and members of Qianhu Brigade also quickly caught up with Zhouhuang Brigade, and labor attendance increased to more than 70%.

Grasp Food Crops with One Hand, and Coarse Grains with the Other
Xincheng Strives for Exceeding Output Quotas for All Crops

(Reported by our newspaper) Xincheng County, Guangxi, is comprehensively strengthening autumn field management, striving for late rice to surpass early rice, coarse grains to surpass food crops, and exceeding output quotas for all crops.

At the beginning of autumn field management, some cadres and members believed that more was planted this year, so there would be a harvest even without care; some, seeing coarse grains all over the mountains and fields, were afraid of not being able to manage them and advocated only grasping food crops and ignoring coarse grains. In response to these ideas, the Xincheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a large-scale debate among cadres and masses, thoroughly criticized right-leaning ideological sentiments, and loudly put forward the slogan "Grasp food crops with one hand, and coarse grains with the other; late rice surpasses early rice, coarse grains surpass food crops, and exceeding output quotas for all crops."

In comprehensively strengthening autumn field management, the county is divided into three types of areas. In addition to the First Secretary grasping the overall situation, the other three secretaries of the county committee are each responsible for one of the three types of areas, strengthening specific leadership. The communes then, according to the planted area and variety of crops, implement a unified plan for field management, comprehensively arrange, distinguish between primary and secondary, and attack in stages. For example, Chengxiang Commune grows late rice, late corn, coarse grains, and cash crops. The most seasonal of these crops are late rice and corn, so the commune Party committee decided to concentrate 95% of the commune's labor force to cultivate and fertilize late rice and corn, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. After six days of concentrated effort, the cultivation and fertilization of late rice and corn was completed, and the main force then turned to the care of coarse grains and cash crops. After another three days of concentrated effort, the cultivation and weeding of coarse grains and crops such as sugarcane and peanuts was completed. In this way, a new situation quickly emerged in the county where field management of all crops, including food crops and coarse grains, was comprehensively strengthened.

By September 6, the second cultivation and fertilization of the county's more than 44,000 mu of late rice had been completed, 100,000 mu of corn had undergone one cultivation and fertilization, and more than 250,000 mu of coarse grains and cash crops had been cultivated and weeded.

Implement Zone Division and Plot-Based Management by Dedicated Personnel
Shaquan Commune's Late Rice Surpasses Early Rice

(Reported by our newspaper) In the super-production campaign, Shaquan Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan, divided the late rice fields into different types according to different soil quality, water conservancy, sunlight, and other natural conditions, delineated zones, and determined advanced output targets and measures to increase production for each plot, so that the current field management work has been carried out in a solid and effective manner. This year, the average yield of early rice in the entire commune was 473 jin per mu, and they are striving to increase late rice production by 30 to 40% compared to early rice.

The Party committee of Shaquan Commune, together with the commune members, first divided all the late rice fields into several major types according to different soil qualities, and then, within the major categories, divided the fields with basically the same soil quality, sunlight, water conservancy, and other natural conditions into small zones of 10 to 15 mu, determining advanced output targets and specific measures for cultivation and management for each plot. Each small zone is assigned an experienced Party member, League member, or team/group cadre to serve as a field manager, who is responsible for implementing these production increase measures. The benefits of doing this are: first, the late rice fields have dedicated personnel for management, who can carry out this work thoroughly; second, each plot has advanced targets and measures to ensure the realization of the targets; third, it is convenient for the leaders of the communes and teams to grasp the situation of each zone and can more effectively guide production; and fourth, it promotes balanced production increases in each plot.

The commune's late rice fields have been divided into 1,570 small zones. After determining the average yield target for each zone and the specific targets and effective production increase measures for each plot, the members are particularly motivated, and competitions have been launched between groups and individuals. For example, the Wumei production team of the Shantian Brigade has 290 mu of late rice fields, of which 130 mu are fine sandy soil that settles and hardens when exposed to water; and these rice fields are prone to stem borers and rice planthoppers. After a field consultation, they decided to carry in about 500 loads of black fertile mud per mu, and at the same time, applied 70 loads of fine fertilizer, so that the soil quality became fertile sandy soil suitable for seedling growth. In addition, with fine cultivation according to local conditions, the 290 mu of late rice in the entire team are now generally more than three feet tall and growing vigorously. The members said that late rice has been planted here for eight years, and only this year is so good, even the stems of this year's early rice seedlings cannot compare. (Zhou Rong)

    抢时间  加措施  要晚秋更高产
    在现场会议上一看二比三学四议
    兴化掀起保苗保粒保桃运动
    本报讯　中共江苏兴化县委最近在唐刘人民公社的周黄、千户两个生产大队召开了现场会议，通过一看、二比、三学、四议的方法，大破右倾保守、大鼓革命干劲，全县掀起秋季生产新高潮。
    周黄大队和千户大队，庄靠庄、田靠田。论条件，千户比周黄稍好一点；比生产，千户却比周黄差。
    今年周黄大队虽然每个劳力负担四亩七分田，十二部风车每部负担一百五十八亩田，再加上河面小，肥泥少；但是全队已经收割的一百五十亩早稻，实收单产六百斤以上，比去年增产三成。中稻穗大穗多，长势超过早稻。晚稻没有一块三类苗。参观的人说：“周黄的生产真是满堂红。”
    千户大队从合作化以来，年年是红旗队。全队每个劳力负担四亩五分田，风车三十部，每部负担六十六亩田，河面大，肥源多。但是全队已经脱粒、晒干的一百八十亩早稻，单产只有四百斤，与去年相平。中稻穗少穗小。二百五十一亩晚稻有七十一亩三类苗，还有一百多亩田脱水。参观的人说：“千户的生产差得很。”
    为什么这两个大队的条件基本相同，生产却大大不相同呢？参观的县社党委书记，根据介绍的情况，就实论虚地做了专门研究。大家认为：最主要的原因：一个是力争上游、鼓足干劲，专找比自己强的先进队做为自己的竞赛对手；一个是甘居中游，干劲不足，满足自己比落后队好。
    周黄大队从支部书记到队干部，争上游、赶先进的思想非常强烈。支部书记韩希明和小队干部经常到先进大队去参观。在抢收早稻抢种晚秋时，韩希明看到何姚大队的胡萝卜比自己种得又快又好，便立即安排劳力，一气种好八十多亩。平时大队党支部经常向社员大讲总路线，大讲大跃进，发动群众鼓干劲、争上游。所有队干部，人人带头生产，在田头大搞群众性的竞赛评比运动，一段一段的开展单项突击。
    今年千户大队就不同了。队干部说：“今年搞到这个样子就算不坏了。”在竞赛中，他们不与条件相同的周黄大队相比，却与条件比自己差的翟家大队比，认为自己总不会落在翟家后面。日常工作也没有细致的计划，劳动出勤率经常只有50％左右。结果，中晚稻比周黄大队迟栽五天。
    参加现场会议的各公社党委书记对当前形势做了具体分析，对各自的作物长势做了具体排队，大家认为，全县一百十三万亩中晚稻和二十万亩棉花，是全年生产的“大头子”，目前生长并未定局，增产潜力还很大。关键是认清形势，鼓足干劲，抓紧当前二十天。措施是：猛攻水、虫、肥、草四个关，开展保苗、保穗、保粒、保桃的四保运动。力争消灭四百斤以下的低产田，在原订指标基础上增产粮食七千万斤到一亿斤，增产皮棉一百五十万斤到二百万斤。大力抢种晚秋，按不同地区平均每人分别达到胡萝卜五百斤、八百斤、一千斤，副业收入每人增加十五元。
    现场会后，全县大搞群众运动，一个声势浩大的生产新高潮迅速在各地开展起来。唐刘公社周黄大队在三天时间，给所有晚稻追了一次肥。千户大队的干部和社员，也急起直追赶周黄大队，劳动出勤增加到70％以上。
    一手抓主粮　一手抓杂粮
    忻城争取样样作物超包产
    本报讯　广西忻城县全面加强秋田管理，力争晚稻超早稻，杂粮超主粮，各项作物样样超包产。
    秋田管理开始，有些干部和社员认为今年种得多，有种就有收，不护理也能增产；有的见杂粮满山遍野，怕管不过来，主张只抓主粮，不管杂粮。针对这些思想，中共忻城县委在干部和群众中，组织大鸣大放大辩论，彻底批判了右倾思想情绪，响亮地提出了“一手抓主粮、一手抓杂粮；晚稻超早稻，杂粮超主粮，粮食，经济作物样样超包产”的口号。
    在全面加强秋田管理中，将全县划分为三种地区。县委书记除第一书记抓全面外，其他三位书记分别包干三种地区，加强具体领导。各公社则根据作物种植面积和品种，实行田间管理的统一计划，全面安排，分清主次缓急，分段突击。如城厢公社种有晚稻、晚玉米、杂粮和经济作物，这些作物中季节性最强的是晚稻和玉米，因此公社党委决定集中全社95％的劳动力为晚稻和玉米耘田追肥，防治病虫害。经过六天突击，完成了晚稻和玉米的中耕追肥后，主力便转向杂粮和经济作物的护理。又经过三天突击，完成了杂粮和甘蔗、花生等作物的中耕除草。这样全县很快出现了主粮杂粮各种作物的田间管理全面加强的新局面。
    到9月6日，这个县四万四千多亩晚稻的二次耘田、追肥已经结束，十万亩玉米已进行了一次中耕追肥，二十五万多亩杂粮和经济作物已经过中耕除草。
    实行划片分丘专人管理
    沙泉公社晚稻胜过早稻
    本报讯　湖南衡山县沙泉公社在超产运动中，根据晚稻田不同的土质、水利、阳光等自然条件，分类划片，分丘确定先进产量指标和增产措施，使当前田间管理工作搞得扎实而有成效。今年全公社早稻平均亩产四百七十三斤，他们力争晚稻比早稻增产三、四成。
    沙泉公社党委和社员群众一道，首先把全部晚稻田按照土质不同，分别成几大类型，然后再在大类中将土质、阳光、水利等自然条件基本相同的田，以十至十五亩划成一小片，分丘定出先进产量指标和培育管理的具体措施。每一小片配一个有经验的党、团员或队、组干部担任田间管理员，由他来执行这些增产措施。这样做的好处：一是晚稻田有了专人管理，能把这一工作一竿子插到底；二是丘丘田有先进指标，有保证实现指标的增产措施；三是便于社队领导人掌握各片情况，能更有效地指导生产；四是促进每丘平衡增产。
    这个社的晚稻田共划成了一千五百七十个小片，在确定每片平均亩产指标，和每丘田的具体指标和有力的增产措施以后，社员们劲头特别足，组与组、人与人互相展开了竞赛。例如山田大队五美生产队有二百九十亩晚稻田，其中有一百三十亩是幼沙泥质，遇水就沉淀板结；而且这些稻田易起钻心虫和稻飞虱。他们经过田头会诊，决定在每亩田里挑进五百来担黑肥泥，同时追施了七十来担细肥，使土质变成了适宜禾苗生长的肥沙土。又因地制宜地精细培育，现在全队二百九十亩晚稻普遍长得苗高三尺多，生势极壮。社员们说，这里连种八年晚稻，只有这届好，就连今年早稻苗秆也比不上。　　（周荣）
