Terms Explained: Cosmic Rockets

    Orbital Elements and Orbital Parameters
    The data used to determine the orbit of a celestial body (including artificial satellites and cosmic rockets) is called orbital elements. Generally, these elements include data indicating the shape and size of the orbit, the position of the orbital plane in space, the direction of the orbit, and the position of the object on the orbit at a certain moment. Other reference data used to help calculate orbital elements are called orbital parameters.

        Earth's Magnetic Field
    The Earth is like a large magnet, and the space around it where magnetic force acts is called the Earth's magnetic field. Celestial bodies such as the Earth and the Sun all have a magnetic field. Scientists have not yet fully understood the origin of the Earth's magnetic field and its extent. Cosmic rockets can be used to obtain materials to solve these problems.

        Radiation Belt
    Through the investigation of the first Soviet artificial satellites, it was discovered that there is a very strong radiation belt around the Earth, composed of particles with relatively low energy. This strong radiation belt has two layers, inner and outer. The lower boundary of the inner radiation belt is 1,500 kilometers in the eastern hemisphere and 500 kilometers in the western hemisphere. High-energy particles, protons with energies up to 100 million electron volts, have been found in the inner radiation belt. The region of highest intensity in the outer radiation belt is at a distance from the Earth equivalent to four Earth radii. The structure and formation causes of these two radiation belts are currently being explored and studied.

    Gaseous Composition of Interplanetary Matter
    The space between the planets in the solar system is not an absolute vacuum. It contains interplanetary dust, molecules, atoms, and electrons, etc. These substances are called interplanetary gaseous matter. According to observations, their composition includes atoms of calcium, iron, sodium, and titanium, etc. The density of these interstellar substances is very small, averaging only one hundred millionth of a millionth of a millionth of the density of water.

        Ray Energy Spectrum
    The energy spectrum of rays is the distribution of the number of ray particles within various energy ranges. For example, how many particles are in the energy range of 2 billion to 3 billion electron volts, how many particles are in the energy range of 3 billion to 4 billion electron volts, etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    有关宇宙火箭的名词解释
    轨道要素和运行参数
    用来决定天体（包括人造卫星和宇宙火箭）的运行轨道所用的数据，叫做轨道要素。一般说这些要素是，表示轨道的形状、大小，轨道面在空间的位置，轨道的方向，及所指天体某一时刻在轨道上的位置等的数据。而帮助计算轨道要素所用的其他参考数据称谓运行参数。
        地球磁场
    地球像一个大磁体，在它的周围，有磁力作用的空间就叫地球磁场。地球、太阳等天体的周围都有一个磁场。科学家对地球磁场的起源和它的范围至今尚未完全掌握，利用宇宙火箭就可得到解决这些问题的材料。
        辐射带
    通过苏联第一批人造卫星的考察，发现在地球周围有由能量相当小的粒子组成的强度极大的辐射带。这种强力辐射带共有内、外两层。内辐射带的下界高度在东半球为一千五百公里，在西半球为五百公里。在内辐射带内发现有高能量粒子，这些粒子是能量达一亿电子伏特的质子。在距地球相当于四个地球半径时，是外层辐射带强变最高的区域。对于这两个辐射带的结构和形成原因都正在探测研究中。
    行星际物质的气体成分
    在太阳系各个行星中间，并不是绝对的真空，其中有星际灰尘、分子、原子和电子等等，这些物质称为行星际的气体物质。它们的成份根据观测到的约有：钙、铁、钠和钛的原子等。这些星际物质的密度都很小，平均只有水的密度的一百万万万万万分之一。
        射线能谱
    射线的能谱就是在各种能量范围内，射线粒子数目的分布情况，例如，在二十亿到三十亿电子伏特的能量间有多少粒子，在三十亿到四十亿电子伏特的能量间有多少粒子等。　（新华社）
