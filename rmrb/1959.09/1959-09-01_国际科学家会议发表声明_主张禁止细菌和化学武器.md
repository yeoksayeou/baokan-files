Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, August 31st: The International Scientists Conference held in Pugwash, Canada, concluded on the 29th with a statement opposing the production and use of bacteriological and chemical weapons.

    The statement pointed out that the use of such weapons in war could cause a large number of casualties, and the scientists participating in the conference advocated prohibiting the use of such weapons of mass destruction, and advocated the cancellation of research conducted to develop and improve such weapons. The statement pointed out, "Only by completely preventing war can human life and civilization be protected from the scourge of chemical, bacteriological and nuclear weapons."
    This International Scientists Conference was initiated by Eaton, a well-known American industrialist and social activist, and began on the 25th. Twenty-six well-known scientists from countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Canada, Britain, France, India, Sweden, and Denmark participated in the conference. The participants unanimously agreed that the great achievements of modern science and technology should be used to benefit mankind, rather than for large-scale destructive wars.
    Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, sent a congratulatory telegram to the conference, congratulating the participants and wishing the conference success.
    Academician Dubinin, head of the Soviet scientists delegation, told TASS reporters when talking about the results of the Pugwash conference: The purpose of the conference was: to discuss the threat of chemical and bacteriological weapons (like nuclear and thermonuclear weapons) to mankind and their potential as a means of mass attack. The conference participants believed that the first step should be to unconditionally prohibit the manufacture and use of chemical and bacteriological weapons. Then, an agreement can be reached on methods of supervision with the participation of international organizations and on the issue of abolishing the work that has been done in this area.
    Dubinin pointed out that the scientists' different views on some issues did not prevent the adoption of a mutually agreed resolution in the form of a conference statement. Dubinin said that the conference's call to ban the manufacture and use of chemical and bacteriological weapons will inevitably receive the support of world public opinion. Achieving these demands will help ease international tensions and contribute to the cause of peace.

    国际科学家会议发表声明
    主张禁止细菌和化学武器
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社渥太华讯：在加拿大帕格沃希城举行的国际科学家会议29日在闭幕时发表声明，反对生产和使用细菌武器和化学武器。
    声明指出，在战争中使用这种武器可能造成大量牺牲，参加会议的科学家主张禁止使用这种大规模毁灭性的细菌武器和化学武器，并且主张取消为了发展和改进这种武器而进行的研究。声明指出，“只有彻底防止战争，才能保卫人类生活和文明免遭化学、细菌和核武器的祸害”。
    这个国际科学家会议是根据美国著名工业家和社会活动家伊顿的倡议在25日开始举行的。参加会议的有来自苏联、美国、加拿大、英国、法国、印度、瑞典和丹麦等国的二十六位著名科学家。与会者一致认为，现代科学技术的伟大成就应该用来为人类造福，而不该用于大规模毁灭性的战争。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫曾给会议发了贺电，向与会者表示祝贺并祝会议成功。
    苏联科学家代表团团长杜比宁院士在谈到帕格沃希会议结果时向塔斯社记者说：会议的目的是：讨论化学武器和细菌武器（如同核武器和热核武器那样）对人类的威胁和作为大规模袭击手段的潜力。会议参加者认为，第一步应该无条件地禁止制造和使用化学武器和细菌武器。然后可以就有国际组织参加的监督的方法问题以及就取消这方面已做的工作问题达成协议。
    杜比宁指出，科学家对某些问题看法不同并没有阻碍以会议声明的形式通过共同同意的决议。杜比宁说，会议提出的禁止制造和使用化学武器和细菌武器的呼吁必然会得到世界公众的支持。实现这些要求将有助于缓和国际紧张局势和有助于和平事业。
