Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 2nd: The strike of 500,000 American steelworkers entered its eighth week today. With the sympathy and support of the broad masses of working people at home and abroad, the steelworkers continue to persist in their struggle and are prepared to meet even more arduous struggles in the future.

Because the steel trusts continue to adhere to their unreasonable stance in the negotiations, the negotiations between labor and management have been interrupted since August 27. A spokesman for the American steel trusts stated brutally that the capitalists have not considered and do not intend to change their unreasonable position in the negotiations.

American steel capitalists once attempted to defeat the strike by cutting off the workers' means of livelihood. In the past seven weeks, striking workers have lost more than $370 million in wages. The strike funds pre-arranged by many local unions have been exhausted, and many striking workers rely on applying for social relief to maintain their lives. However, this has not only failed to dampen the workers' fighting spirit but has also increasingly aroused their hatred for the monopoly capitalists. According to a Pittsburgh dispatch in the American "Workers' Weekly," beneath the outwardly calm and orderly strike, the anger of steelworkers toward the monopoly capitalists is growing.

According to American newspapers, American steel trusts earned a profit of $694.22 million in the first half of this year, equivalent to 263.4% of the profit in the same period last year. Steel companies extort $4,345 from each steelworker every year, but stubbornly refuse the workers' demand for a 15-cent hourly wage increase. Many workers have stated that they absolutely cannot accept the steel company's unreasonable contract. The striking workers told McDonald, president of the United Steelworkers Union, that if he compromises with the capitalists, he should forget about being the union president in the future.

The struggle of the steelworkers has received the support of the broad masses of working people in the United States and has promoted their struggle. The Communist Party of the United States has called on all American workers to unite and fully support the steelworkers' strike. The AFL-CIO, the largest trade union organization in the United States, also recently passed a resolution calling for support for the steelworkers' strike and designated September 7 as "Support Steelworkers Day."

The extension of the American steel strike is having an increasingly significant impact on the United States. Since the strike began, American steel production has been reduced by approximately 2 million tons per week. The U.S. Department of Labor acknowledged on August 29 that difficulties are becoming increasingly serious. It said that the stockpiles of steel in most parts of the United States can generally barely last until mid-September. After mid-September, the lack of steel may be serious and will become more and more severe. According to American bourgeois newspapers, the U.S. government has long been considering using the excuse that the strike "endangers national security" to force workers to stop the strike for eighty days under the reactionary Taft-Hartley anti-labor law.

However, as class contradictions in the United States become increasingly acute, the American strike movement continues to develop in a magnificent and turbulent manner. In addition to the ongoing major strikes by steel, lead-zinc, and copper workers, workers at Youngstown Steel Door Company, which manufactures truck parts, and several thousand workers at five steel warehouse centers of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. went on strike on September 1 to fight for the signing of new contracts. The Railway Labor Executives Association, composed of the non-operating railway unions in the United States, announced on August 31 that if the railway companies do not stop implementing the order to postpone the payment of wage increases for three years, the 850,000 members of the non-operating unions will strike in November. The dispute between the Machinists Union and Pan American Airlines is also developing. These brewing strikes may paralyze major parts of the American transportation system.

    依靠劳动人民支持反击钢铁老板进攻
    美国钢铁工人斗志不可动摇
    罢工进入第八周钢铁储存量日少
    据新华社2日讯　纽约消息：美国五十万钢铁工人大罢工今天进入第八周。钢铁工人在国内外广大劳动人民同情和声援下，继续坚持斗争，并准备迎接今后更艰巨的斗争。
    由于钢铁托辣斯在谈判中继续坚持其无理立场，劳资双方的谈判已从8月27日起中断。美国钢铁托辣斯发言人横蛮地表示，资方没有考虑过也不打算考虑改变它在谈判中的无理立场。
    美国钢铁资本家曾经妄图以断绝工人的生活来源击败罢工，七周以来，罢工工人已经损失了三亿七千多万美元的工资收入。不少地方工会事先筹集的罢工基金已经用完，许多罢工工人靠申请社会救济维持生活。但是，这不仅没有能挫馁工人的斗志，而且愈益激发了他们对垄断资本家的仇恨。据美国“工人周报”一篇匹兹堡通讯说，在表面平静的有秩序的罢工底下，钢铁工人对垄断资本家的愤怒在日益增长。
    据美国报刊报道，美国钢铁托辣斯今年上半年赚了六亿九千四百二十万美元的利润，等于去年同期利润的263.4％。钢铁公司每年从每个钢铁工人身上剥削得到四千三百四十五美元，但却顽固地拒绝工人提出的每小时增加工资一角五分的要求。许多工人表示，绝对不能接受钢铁公司无理的合同。罢工工人对联合钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳说，假如他向资方妥协，以后就别想当工会主席。
    钢铁工人的斗争得到美国广大劳动人民的支持，并且推动了他们的斗争。美国共产党号召全美国工人团结一致全力支持钢铁工人的罢工。美国最大的工会组织劳联—产联最近也通过了号召支援钢铁工人罢工的决议，并规定9月7日为“支持钢铁工人日”。
    美国钢铁罢工的延长对美国正在产生日益显著的影响。罢工以来，美国每周钢铁减产约二百万吨。美国劳工部8月29日承认困难越来越严重。它说，美国大部分地区钢铁的储存量大体只能勉强用到9月中。9月中以后，缺乏钢铁的情况可能是严重的，并且会越来越厉害。据美国资产阶级报刊透露，美国政府早已在考虑届时借口罢工“危及国家安全”，根据反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，强制工人停止罢工八十天。
    但是，随着美国国内阶级矛盾日益尖锐化，美国罢工运动正继续波澜壮阔地发展。除了钢铁、铅锌和铜业工人的大罢工正在继续进行以外，制造货车零件的扬斯顿钢门公司的工人和约瑟夫·赖尔森公司五个钢铁仓库中心的几千工人1日为了争取签订新合同又举行了罢工。由美国各铁路非列车人员工会组成的铁路工人领袖协会8月31日宣布，假如铁路公司不停止执行把增加工资延期三年偿付的命令的话，非列车人员工会八十五万会员将在11月举行罢工。飞行机械师工会同泛美航空公司的争执也在发展中。这些酝酿中的罢工可能使美国运输系统的主要部分陷于瘫痪。
