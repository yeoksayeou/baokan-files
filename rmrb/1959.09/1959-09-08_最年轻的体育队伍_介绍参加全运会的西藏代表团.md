	The Youngest Sports Team
	——Introducing the Tibetan Delegation Participating in the National Games
		By Our Correspondent Yu Qi
	Of the twenty-nine delegations participating in the First National Games, the Tibetan delegation is the youngest. This "youth" is not only reflected in the age of the athletes but especially in the sports movement of the Tibetan region they represent. The new undertaking there began not long ago, and modern mass sports have just sprouted. However, this sprout, under the care and nurture of the great united family of all ethnic groups in the powerful motherland, shows an extraordinary appearance from the very beginning, with strong growth and solid roots.
	The Tibetan delegation to Beijing consists of 158 athletes, with an average age of only 21. Among them, 47 are Tibetan athletes, accounting for 30% of the total delegation. The vast majority of them are children from farmers' and herdsmen's families, and a few are from serf families. In this delegation, in addition to Tibetans, there are also Han, Hui, and Miao people.
	Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan people were gasping under the cruel rule of the serf system, and there were no modern sports at all. After the peaceful liberation, under the leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, government agencies and troops actively carried out sports activities and built basketball courts everywhere around their residences. From then on, the flowers of modern sports began to bloom in Tibet. Even so, it was often obstructed and made difficult by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, who spread superstitious and absurd languages ​​such as "playing ball will drive the gods away" and "men jumping and women dancing will make highland barley not grow," to prevent Tibetan youth from participating in sports activities. The People's Government had originally planned to build well-equipped stadiums and gymnasiums in Lhasa early on, but construction was not started due to opposition from the upper reactionary groups. Therefore, Tibet still does not have a better sports venue.
	Under these circumstances, the level of sports in Tibet is naturally behind other provinces and cities, but the Tibetan delegation is a young and promising team full of energy, studying hard, and striving to catch up with the national level. With the help of outstanding athletes from various places, their competitive achievements are changing rapidly. In the early stage of intensive training, there were only about 20 graded athletes, and now, in just three or four months, they already have more than 130 graded athletes, many of whom have reached the level of first-class athletes. The events they are participating in at the National Games in Beijing include track and field, shooting, cycling, and motorcycles.
	Tibetan athletes have very good arm strength and endurance, and have unlimited potential for development in throwing and long-distance running. The hand grenade throwing score of the shepherdess Zhuo Gaqunzong was originally only 35 meters, but now it has broken through 46 meters, reaching the standard of a first-class athlete. The male athlete Zaxi Luobu originally could only throw 58 meters, but now he has exceeded 64 meters. The long-distance running of the Tibetan youth Pubu has also improved rapidly. He originally had good endurance but a slow speed. After only a short period of training, he has now achieved a score of 17 minutes and 0.6 seconds in the 5,000-meter run and 36 minutes and 18 seconds in the 10,000-meter run. If he works hard to exercise in the future to gradually adapt himself to various climates and living conditions, he will be a very promising long-distance runner. Jiaba's sprint is also not bad. When he started practicing, he ran 100 meters in 12.3 seconds, but now he has shortened it to 11.8 seconds. Of course, these results are still some distance away from the national record, but it is very gratifying to be able to achieve such results after only a short period of training.
	The female shooter Su Na Yangzhong is 22 years old this year and used to be a rural girl who only recently started learning to shoot. She trains hard, rain or shine, and now she can shoot multiple consecutive shots into the bullseye with a small-caliber rifle.
	Motorcycle sports started even later in Tibet, but good players are constantly emerging, and the female athlete Ping Cuo Zhuoma is one of them. She is a 20-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, brave and strong. She has overturned and been injured and hospitalized, but after her injury healed, she not only did not shrink back but practiced even more diligently, and her driving skills have also improved rapidly. She will be a strong competitor in the women's motorcycle competition.
	The fact that Tibet has sent a sports delegation from thousands of miles away to the capital to participate in the First National Games is a new page in the history of China's sports movement. The Tibetan people are also honored to be able to send their children to participate in the National Games. Recalling the old China era, the Kuomintang reactionaries also held several so-called National Games, but Tibet only had a few athletes participating in total. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the united and friendly family of all ethnic groups in the motherland, can the health and happiness of the minority people be truly cared for.

    最年轻的体育队伍
    ——介绍参加全运会的西藏代表团	本报记者　尤淇
    在参加第一届全国运动会的二十九个代表团里，西藏代表团是最年轻的一个。“年轻”，不仅表现在运动员的年龄上，特别表现在他们所代表的西藏地区的体育运动上。那里新的事业开始不久，现代的群众性的体育运动也刚刚吐露嫩芽。但是这支嫩芽在各族人民大团结的强大祖国的关怀和抚育下，它一开始就显露出极不平常的面貌，生长力很强，也很扎实。
    西藏代表团到北京的运动员共有一百五十八人，平均年龄只有二十一岁。其中藏族运动员有四十七人，占全团人数的30％。他们绝大部分是农牧民家庭的子弟，也有个别运动员是农奴家庭出身。在这个代表团里，除藏族外，还有汉族、回族和苗族。
    在西藏和平解放前，西藏人民喘息在农奴制的残酷统治下，根本没有现代的体育运动。和平解放以后，在中共西藏工委的领导下，机关部队积极地开展了体育活动，在驻地周围到处修建篮球场，从此西藏地区才开始开放出现代体育运动的一些花朵。就是这样，还经常受到西藏上层反动集团的阻挠和刁难，他们散布“打球会把神打跑”、“男蹦女跳会使青稞不长”等迷信荒诞的语言，阻止藏族青年参加体育活动。人民政府本来早打算在拉萨建筑设备完善的体育场和体育馆，也因受到上层反动集团的反对而没有动工。因此，西藏到现在还没有一个比较好些的运动场所。
    在这种情况下，西藏地区的运动水平较其他省市自然要落后一些，但西藏代表团却是一支干劲十足，刻苦学习，努力追赶全国水平的年轻有为的队伍。他们在各地优秀选手的帮助下，竞技成绩日新月异，在集训初期，只有二十个左右等级运动员，而现在，时间不过三、四个月，已经拥有一百三十多个等级运动员，其中已有不少人达到一级运动员的水平。他们到北京参加全国运动会的项目计有田径、射击、自行车和摩托车等。
    藏族运动员都有很好的臂力和耐力，在投掷和长跑方面有无限的发展前途。牧羊姑娘卓呷群宗的手榴弹掷远成绩，原来只有三十五米，现在已经突破四十六米，达到一级运动员的标准。男选手扎西罗布原来只能投掷五十八米，现在已超过六十四米。藏族青年普布的长距离赛跑进步也很快。他本来耐力好，但速度较慢，仅经过短期训练，现在已达到五千米跑十七分零点六秒，一万米跑三十六分十八秒的成绩，如果今后努力锻炼，使自己逐渐适应各种气候和生活条件，将是一个很有前途的长跑运动员。呷巴的短跑也不差，在开始练习时，他跑一百米要十二点三秒，现在已缩短到十一点八秒。当然，这些成绩同全国纪录相比还有一定距离，但是，锻炼不久，就能够达到这样的成绩，已经是很可喜的了。
    射击女运动员苏娜央中，今年二十二岁，过去是农村姑娘，才学射击不久。她刻苦锻炼，风雨无阻，现在小口径步枪射击已经能够一连多枪射中十环。
    摩托车运动在西藏开展得更晚，但好手也在不断涌现，女运动员平错卓玛就是其中的一个。她是一个二十岁的共青团员，勇敢坚强，曾翻车受伤，进过医院治疗，但伤好后不仅不畏缩，反而练习得更加勤奋，驾驶技术也提高很快。她将是女子摩托车比赛中激烈竞争的强手。
    西藏派出体育代表团不远万里而来，到首都参加第一届全国运动会，这是我国体育运动史上的新的一页。西藏人民也以能够派出自己的子女参加全国运动会感到光荣。回想在旧中国时代，国民党反动派也曾举行了几次所谓全国运动会，但西藏一共只有几个运动员参加。只有在共产党的领导下，在祖国各族人民团结友爱的大家庭里，少数民族人民的健康和幸福才能受到真正的关怀。
