Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, September 4th: The main body, charging, gas, water supply and drainage, thermal air blowing, and surrounding six major system projects of Baotou Steel Company's No. 1 Blast Furnace have comprehensively entered the final stage after more than a year of intense construction. The day of furnace baking and iron tapping is getting closer.

The steel structure of the No. 1 Blast Furnace body, weighing more than 10,000 tons, as well as the installation and construction of refractory materials and various mechanical equipment, have all been completed. Standing on the furnace top of the blast furnace, which is more than twenty stories high, and looking down, you can see that the large and small charging bells, distributors, hoists and other charging equipment recently installed on the furnace top are gleaming in the sunlight. Near the blast furnace, six gas scrubbing devices, including gas scrubbing towers and electrostatic precipitators as high as thirty to forty meters, have all been put in place according to the requirements of iron tapping.

A silver-gray belt conveyor corridor runs from the throat of the blast furnace's feeding area—the stock bin trestle—directly to the northwest coking chemical plant and temporary ore storage yard. A total of fourteen belt conveyors for transporting ore, coke, and limestone are to be installed in this long corridor. Eleven of them have already been installed, and the other three will be completed soon. From the coking chemical plant, a large steel pipe more than one person high winds down to the east, connecting with the thermal power station and steam blower station not far to the east. This is the main pipe of the gas pipeline network, which has been fully completed. To the east, the blower station roars with machinery. On August 30, the turbine was successfully test-run, and on the 1st, the blower body also began test-run. The blower station and three hot blast stoves, which have been baking since August 29, will supply the blast furnace with more than 4,000 cubic meters of hot air per minute.

The No. 5 pumping station, built in the southeast direction of the blast furnace, will provide sufficient cooling water for the blast furnace when it is put into production. At present, all its equipment has been installed and it can be test-run with water within days. The power supply heart of the blast furnace system—No. 1 substation—was officially energized as early as the afternoon of August 20.

    包钢新建高炉进入收尾阶段
    据新华社包头4日电　包头钢铁公司一号高炉的本体、上料、煤气、供水排水、热力鼓风、外围六大系统的工程，经过一年多的紧张建设，已经全面进入收尾阶段。高炉烘炉出铁的日子日益迫近了。
    一号高炉本体重达一万多吨的钢铁结构，以及耐火材料和各种机械设备的安装砌筑工程，已经全部完成了。站在二十多层楼高的高炉炉顶向下看，只见炉顶新近安装起来的大料钟、小料钟、布料器、卷扬机等装料设备，在阳光下漆光闪亮。高炉附近高达三四十米的煤气洗涤塔、电力除尘器等六座煤气洗涤装置，已经按照出铁时的要求全部就位。
    一条银灰色的皮带运输通廊，从高炉进食的咽喉——料仓栈桥，直通西北的炼焦化学厂和临时储矿场。在这条长长的通廊里，一共要安装十四台运送矿石、焦炭、石灰石的皮带运输机，目前有十一台已经安装完，另外三台也快完了。从炼焦化学厂有一条直径一人多高的大钢管蜿蜒东下，同东面不远的热电站、蒸汽鼓风机站联结起来，这是已经全部竣工的煤气管网的主管。东面，鼓风机站机声轰鸣。8月30日，透平机试运转成功，1日，鼓风机本体也开始试运转。鼓风机站和三座已从8月29日起先后开始烘炉的热风炉，每分钟将为高炉供应四千多立方米的热风。
    建立在高炉东南方向的五号水泵站，当高炉投入生产后，将为高炉提供充足的冷却水。目前，它的设备已经全部安装好了，日内即可带水试车。高炉系统的供电心脏——一号变电所，早在8月20日下午就已正式通电。
