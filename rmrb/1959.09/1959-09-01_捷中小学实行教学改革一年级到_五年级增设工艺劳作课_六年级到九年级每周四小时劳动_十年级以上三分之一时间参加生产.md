Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 30th -- According to the resolution of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's plenary session in April of this year, in the 1959-1960 academic year, the nation's middle and primary schools will formally implement a teaching reform that closely integrates teaching with production and life.

In the new academic year, handicraft labor classes will be added from the first to fifth grades. Sixth to ninth grades will have four hours of labor in school-affiliated workshops each week, as well as one hour of production theory class. Students in the tenth to twelfth grades will spend one-third of each semester working and participating in production in factories, rural areas, or construction sites. In addition, schools will organize various voluntary labor activities.

The teaching reform not only provides students with new learning content, but also puts forward new tasks and requirements for teachers. During the summer vacation, almost all middle and primary school teachers across the country participated in various production internships to adapt to the needs of the new teaching tasks. In August, teachers from various states also gathered to discuss and study how to better complete the tasks of the teaching reform. Many schools have also hired factory workers to teach production and labor classes to students. In order to cultivate more new types of teachers, twenty specialized colleges have been established this year in various states across the country, where teachers will be trained entirely in accordance with the requirements of the new teaching reform.

Factories are also strongly supporting the school teaching reform work. They are building workshops for schools and properly arranging students' production internships in factories. At present, nine-year and eight-year schools across the country have their own workshops, and almost all the machines and tools in the workshops are provided by nearby factories.

    捷中小学实行教学改革一年级到
    五年级增设工艺劳作课
    六年级到九年级每周四小时劳动
    十年级以上三分之一时间参加生产
    据新华社布拉格30日电　根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央今年4月全会的决议，在1959—1960年度，全国的中学和小学将正式实行教学与生产和生活密切结合的教学改革。
    在今年的新学年中，从一年级到五年级将增设工艺劳作课，六年级到九年级每周将有四小时在学校附设的车间劳动，还有一小时上生产理论课。十年到十二年级的学生每学期将有三分之一的时间到工厂、农村或工地劳动和参加生产。此外，学校还将组织各种义务劳动。
    教学改革不仅是给学生们提供新的学习内容，同时也给教员们提出了新的任务和要求。在暑假中，几乎全国的中、小学教员都参加了各种生产实习，以适应新的教学任务的需要。8月份各州的教师还分别聚集在一起对如何更好地完成教学改革的任务进行了讨论和研究。还有许多学校聘请了工厂的工人来为学生们上生产和劳动课。为了培养更多新型的师资，今年全国各州又建立了二十所专门的学院，在那里将完全按照新的教学改革的要求来培养师资。
    工厂也大力支持学校教学改革的工作，他们为学校建立车间，妥善安排学生在工厂的生产实习。目前，全国九年制和八年制的学校都有了自己的车间，车间的机器和工具几乎全部是附近的工厂提供的。
