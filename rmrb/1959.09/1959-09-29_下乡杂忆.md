    Recollections of Going to the Countryside
    Zhao Shuli
    It has become a habit for people to recall the past during a grand festival. Before the grand celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China, I would like to talk about my experience of going to the countryside. Coincidentally! My history of going to the countryside is exactly ten years—because ten years ago I simply lived in the countryside, so there was no such thing as going down; it was only after I came to our capital, Beijing, in 1949 that going to the countryside again was called going down.
    After arriving in Beijing, I served in some local work. During this period, I also wanted to familiarize myself with some local conditions on the spot and take Beijing as my new base. However, after a little experimentation, I felt that a writing base was not so easy to create. Things that are not easy to do can naturally be achieved with more effort. However, I felt that abandoning a place I was already familiar with and then becoming familiar with a place that was not easy to become familiar with would be doing twice the work with half the effort, and there was no great need to do so. Therefore, I decided to go to the countryside again.
    Our political and cultural center, the capital, is certainly lovely, but the rural areas, the producing areas of grain, cotton, and oil, are also lovely. If you want to ask which is more lovely, I think it's like asking which is more lovely, the lotus or the chrysanthemum—different kinds of things cannot be compared. A writer should not be an interest-oriented person, but a writer must always maintain a full interest in the base where he is familiar with the lives of the masses. Even from the perspective of material enjoyment, cities and rural areas each have their own merits. For example, when farmers hold meetings on the threshing ground at night, they sit on the wheat straw that has been threshed. This kind of seat gives people a different kind of comfort. If it were replaced by a chair in the Beijing Workers' Club, I'm afraid it would be a little worse—naturally, if the Beijing Workers' Club were covered with wheat straw, it would not be as suitable as a chair. Different kinds of things cannot be interchanged. For example, farmers in the suburbs pick green corn one day and sell it in the city the next day. If it is sold to a farmer again, this farmer will know that the corn is from the previous night after taking the first bite. However, it is difficult for city people to eat corn that has just been picked that day, so it is not easy to taste the freshness of new corn. City people naturally eat very carefully, but they have fewer opportunities to eat fresh agricultural products than rural people. Since I was a child, I have developed a stomach for digesting millet and legs for climbing mountains. I will never let these two physiological functions degenerate. Some people may think that in the future, when material conditions improve, there will be no need to eat millet and climb mountains. But I think that even if that is the case, there is nothing wrong with having the habit of climbing mountains and the fondness for eating fried millet and rice.
    The charm of rural life certainly makes me nostalgic, but what is more worthy of nostalgia are the people who have worked with us for a long time. Taihang Mountain is an old liberated area. The farmers here, during the national democratic revolution, jointly resisted enemies at home and abroad with us, and jointly eliminated the exploitative system of the landlord class. I personally worked with them during these times, and I also wrote about their struggles, so I took this place as my base for familiarizing myself with the lives of the masses. When I returned in 1951 to a mountain village where our agency had been stationed during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the crops were still as green as they were back then, and the local food still tasted as local as it did back then. However, the people's spirit was much more active than before—because we had a central government, and the folks welcomed me, an old acquaintance who had returned, as victors.
    I have said elsewhere that my personal method of familiarizing myself with rural life is to "work together" with people. Chairman Mao told us that "only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses." I feel that in the process of working together, it is both good to be a student and good to be a teacher. Chairman Mao wanted us to go to the masses to "observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle..." These many "all" seem to be a myriad of things, and it is not easy to take care of everything. In fact, as long as you work with the masses for a long time, even if you want to prevent any aspect from being reached, it will not work. The real society is originally composed of a myriad of things. In my ten years of life in the countryside, I have only continued to work with the people I worked with before. The only difference is that ten years ago, we worked together on national and democratic revolutionary affairs, and in the past ten years, we have worked together on socialist revolution and socialist construction affairs.
    Working with these old comrades-in-arms has a great sense of satisfaction, that is, they have developed a selfless spirit that does not care about personal gains or losses in the long-term war environment. For example, agricultural cooperation was only started on a large scale in 1953 across the country, while in this area it was tested in 1951 and promoted in 1952; mutual support between villages and counties to build water conservancy projects was a matter of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 across the country, while in this area it started in 1956. Although they are all farmers who do not leave production, they are also some revolutionary romantics. When they encounter new things, they not only have few concerns, but also have great interest. When the Liu-Deng army went south from Taihang Mountain to the Dabie Mountain area in 1947 to carry out pioneering work, they organized tens of thousands of laborers to join the army for up to a year. During this year, they used shoulder poles to escort prisoners, and some simply stayed there to do local work. Even now, when they talk about this period, they still think it was a very interesting period of life. In their view, the vigor of the Great Leap Forward is just a continuation of this revolutionary spirit, and it is not unfamiliar at all.
    In the past ten years, I have worked with these old comrades-in-arms on many things again. What we have worked together on is: from mutual aid groups to communization, from planting apple trees to putting apples on the market, from the lack of teachers for literacy campaigns to every township having a middle school, from climbing mountains with two legs and messengers delivering letters to every county having access to cars and every village having telephones. The more things I work with them on, the fewer works I write, but I feel that this is not a losing proposition—being able to contribute a little to practical work, the social value generated will not be smaller than the works. At the same time, most of the things that I have worked on seriously will still be reflected in my works after a period of time, and perhaps they will be reflected more accurately. I will continue to do this for a long time.

    下乡杂忆
    赵树理
    趁着一个隆重的节日回忆往事，已经成为人们的习惯。在我们中华人民共和国建国十周年的大庆之前，我想谈谈我的下乡。巧得很！我下乡的历史也恰好只有十年——因为十年之前我根本生活在乡间，无所谓什么下不下；自从1949年来到我们的首都北京，才把再到乡间去称为下乡。
    到了北京之后，我曾担任过一点地方性工作。在这期间，我也曾想就地熟悉一些地方情况，把北京作为我新的根据地，可是略一试验，便觉得写作上的根据地不那么容易 创造。不易办到的事，多加努力自然也可以成功，不过我觉着放弃一个自己已经熟悉的地方，再去熟悉一个不太容易熟悉的地方，事倍功半，无大必要，因此才又决定下乡。
    我们政治文化中心的首都固然可爱，但粮棉油料产地的农村也是可爱的。假如要问二者相较哪方面更可爱，我以为这和问荷花与菊花哪个更可爱一样——不同类的事物不能作比较。一个写作者不应该是兴趣主义者，可是一个写作者总得对自己熟悉群众生活的根据地永远保持着饱满的兴趣。即从物质享受方面来说，城市和农村也是各有千秋的。例如农民晚上在打麦场上开会，坐在打过麦子的麦秸上。这种坐位使人另有一种舒服感，要换成北京工人俱乐部的椅子，恐怕还要差一点——自然要把北京工人俱乐部铺上麦秸，就不如椅子合适，不同类的事物不能互换。再如城郊农民头一天把青玉米披下来，第二天到城里煮着卖，要是又卖到一个农民手里的话，这个农民啃第一口就知道这玉米是隔了夜的。可是城市人很难吃到当天掰下来的玉米，所以不易尝出新玉米的鲜味。城市人吃饭自然也吃得很细致，但是吃新鲜农产品的机会却少于农村。我从小曾锻炼了一个消化小米的胃口和两条爬山的腿，这两种生理的性能，我将永远不让它退化。也许有人以为将来物质条件提高了，再用不着吃小米和爬山，可我想即使是那样，有爬山的习惯，吃炒小米捞饭的嗜好，也没有什么不好。
    田园风趣固然使我留恋，但更值得留恋的还是和我们长期共过事的人。太行山是老解放区。这里的农民，在民族民主革命时期，和我们共同抵抗过国外、国内的敌人，共同消灭过地主阶级的剥削制度。我个人在这些时候曾和他们共过事，又曾写过他们这些斗争，所以才把 这地方作为我熟悉群众生活的根据地。当我在1951年重新到了在抗日战争时期我们的机关驻扎过的一个山村的时候，庄稼长得还像当年那样青绿，乡土饭吃起来还是那样的乡土风味，只是人们的精神要比以往活跃得多——因为我们有了中央政府，老乡们都以胜利者的姿态来欢迎我这个回来的老熟人。
    我曾在其他地方说过，我个人熟悉农村生活的方法就是和人“共事”。毛主席告诉我们说，“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”。我觉着在共事中间，既好做学生，又好做先生。毛主席要我们到群众中去“观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式……”这好多“一切”，看来好像千头万绪，不易面面俱到，其实只要和群众长期共事，即使想叫哪一面不到也不行，现实的社会本来就是由千头万绪组成的。我在这十年下乡生活中，不过是和以前共过事的人们继续共事，不同的只是十年以前共的是民族、民主革命之事，十年以来共的是社会主义革命和社会主义建设之事而已。
    和这种老战友们共事有个痛快劲儿，那就是他们在长期战争环境中养成了些不计个人得失的忘我精神。例如农业合作化在全国是1953年才开始大搞的，而在这个地区则是1951年试验、1952年推广的；越乡越县互相支援兴修水利在全国是1958年大跃进中的事，而在这个地区则是从1956年就开始的。他们虽然都是不脱离生产的农民，但也是些革命的浪漫主义者。他们遇上了新鲜事物，不但顾虑不多，而且兴趣颇大。当1947年刘邓大军从太行山南下大别山区作开辟工作的时候，曾组织过他们几万民工随军参战达一年之久。在这一年中间，他们曾拿着扁担押解过俘虏，有的干脆就留在那里作了地方工作，直到现在谈起这段事来他们还认为是很有趣的一段生活。大跃进的劲头，在他们看来只是这种革命精神的继续，一点也不生疏。
    十年间，我又曾和这些老战友共过好多事。我们所共的事是：从互助组一直共到公社化，从栽接苹果树一直共到苹果上市场，从扫盲缺教员一直共到乡乡有中学，从两条腿爬山、交通员送信一直共到县县通汽车、村村安电话。和他们共的事多一点，写的作品就少一点，不过我觉着这也不是什么赔本的事——能在实际工作中供献一点力量，所 产生的社会价值不会比作品小，同时，凡是自己认真作过的事，过一个时期大部分都还会反映在自己的作品中，而且或者还会反映得更准确一点。我将长期地这样做下去。
