Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 5th: The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, when transmitted to the workers on the thousands of miles of salt flats in Jiangsu Province on the shores of the Yellow Sea, added new strength to the fighting workers. More than 10,000 salt workers in 22 salt fields across the province have launched a vigorous autumn "100-day battle," striving to complete this year's salt production plan of 1.44 million tons ahead of schedule in September, to greet the 10th anniversary of National Day.

During the major battle in mid-August, Jiangsu Province's salt fields achieved unprecedented results, producing more than 267,000 tons of crude salt in the whole month, exceeding the plan by 1.6 times. Responding to the Party's call, salt workers are in high spirits, launching competitions between fields, between work areas, between groups, and between individuals, determined to work hard, practically, and skillfully to create new miracles in the major battle of September. The Qingfu圩 advanced group in the Xin Hailian Salt Field completed this year's salt production plan 36% ahead of schedule in August. Group leader Gu Licheng said, "We must race against time and sunlight to produce more salt." They go to the beach before dawn every day to scoop brine and cultivate salt, ensuring an increase in crude salt production by 8,000 dan in September, achieving two years' worth of plan in one year. The workers in the group led by Zhu Jingyun, a national advanced producer, cultivated a total of 120 salt fields on the day they heard the communique and resolutions, more than 40 more than usual. By August, the salt field he was in had produced 535,000 tons of salt, completing more than 88% of the annual plan. Based on the opinions of the workers, the salt field leadership decided to increase crude salt production by 85,000 tons this year.

Recently, there has been widespread rainfall in various salt fields. Salt field workers have strengthened their work in the rainy season, doing a good job of protecting the brine before and after the rain, so that the salt brine is not or is minimally damaged. They brave the rain to drain fresh water, ensuring that it is drained as it falls, so that the field dries as soon as the rain stops, and immediately fills the ponds for crystallization.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 5th: The 50,000 salt workers on the coast of Zhejiang, who are fighting against adverse natural conditions, heard the great call to battle from the Party Central Committee, and are even more motivated, determined to build on the daily increase in crude salt production in August and advance victoriously, producing more crude salt.

The third quarter is the peak season for salt production on the coast of Zhejiang. However, this year there has been a lot of rain, high tides, and several typhoons and rainstorms, which is very unfavorable for open-air salt production. In order to increase crude salt production and support the continued leap forward of the national economy, the salt workers are determined to fight against typhoons, floods, and droughts, and have launched a competition upsurge to produce more salt, produce good salt, and find ways to open up sources of brine. Fifteen of the twenty counties and cities producing salt along the coast of the province have established salt production headquarters, and many county party secretaries and commune party secretaries have personally gone to the salt fields to participate in the battle, working with the salt field workers to overcome natural disasters. When a breach occurred in the seawall of Linhai Salt Field, the leading cadres of the Linhai County Party Committee led the workers in a bitter battle for three days and nights, blocking the breach and striving for full exposure to the sun. A total of 9,369 people in the Zhoushan County salt area were involved in the fight against the typhoon, repairing 13,327 meters of seawalls and grabbing and carrying more than 116,440 dan of salty mud, which greatly increased the rate of exposure of the salt fields. In order to maintain the concentration of seawater for salt production, the workers in many salt fields have adopted the method of using fresh seawater from the tidal head during dry weather and concentrated seawater from the tidal tail during flood tides, and strictly managing the sluice gates to ensure that there is no shortage of tides during long periods of sunny weather and that fresh water does not accumulate in the salt fields after rain. The Xiadun and Xinhe salt fields in Wenling County organized forces to dig tidal canals. The members of the Guanghui Production Team of Xinhe Commune dried salt during the day and dug ditches at night, and organized 304 people to take turns drawing fresh and salt water day and night, so that all the salt pans and reservoirs were full of seawater. All the workers of the Andong People's Commune salt field came up with various ways to increase the source of brine, so that salt production increased day by day. In order to speed up salt drying, the workers improved tools, equipment, and operating methods, strengthened meteorological forecasting work, and made full use of natural evaporation to increase production.

Since August, crude salt production in Zhejiang Province has been increasing day by day. In the first five days of late August, crude salt production reached 3,619 tons, an increase of 36.62% compared with the ten days of mid-August, and the salt production from August 1st to 25th was 4.78% more than the total salt production in August last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the salt farmers along the coast of Fujian are determined to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions of overcoming rainstorm disasters and increasing the production of more sea salt. Salt fields and salt production teams along the coast of Fujian have held mass meetings, formulated plans and measures to overcome autumn rain and storm disasters, and complete and overfulfill the annual production targets, determined to increase the production of more and better sea salt. More than 1,300 cadres and salt farmers in Dongshan Salt Field are determined to produce another 1.15 million dan of sea salt on the basis of overfulfilling the state plan by 44% in the first half of the year, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of National Day and celebrate the glorious achievements of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Salt farmers in Tong'an, Nan'an, Putian, and other salt fields have also rapidly launched a competition upsurge to compare output, compare quality, compare comprehensive utilization, compare work efficiency, compare infrastructure construction progress, and compare safe production.

The salt farmers in Xiamen, Haicheng, and other places, who suffered from typhoons and rainstorms above level 12 on August 23rd and 30th, were inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and were determined to respond to the Party and the government's meticulous care with practical actions such as rapidly restoring production, completing and overfulfilling the original plan, and recovering from wind disaster losses. The salt farmers in Hui'an Salt Field, who fought for three days from August 28th to 30th and ensured that the salt field and 28 million catties of edible salt were basically undamaged under the attack of typhoons and rainstorms, quickly repaired some of the damaged salt ridges and equipment and resumed normal production on the first day after the wind and rain passed.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 5th: The workers of Tanggu Salt Field in Changlu Salt District, Hebei Province, are determined to overcome the difficulties of much rain and little high-concentration brine, and strive to overfulfill this year's sea salt production task, so that this year's annual output will exceed the highest sea salt output in history in 1958.

The call to battle from the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was transmitted to the salt flats of Bohai Bay, and more than 10,000 workers of Tanggu Salt Field have held meetings for days to discuss and revise this year's production increase plan, and then launched a tense autumn drying battle. More than half of the crystallization ponds in the field have begun to crystallize, and 1,170 tons of new salt were produced from September 1st to 3rd, laying the foundation for a good final battle in this year's autumn drying.

This year, due to the impact of heavy rainfall, the output of Tanggu Salt Field in the first eight months only reached 74.56% of the annual plan, a decrease of 24,000 tons compared with the same period last year. At the same time, high-concentration brine also decreased by more than 735,000 cubic meters compared with last year, so some cadres lacked confidence in completing this year's production plan. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the leading cadres of this salt field, on the one hand, checked and criticized the slack mood, and on the other hand, let go of mobilizing the masses. After repeated discussions, all the salt workers analyzed the favorable conditions in the current production, pointing out that although the high-concentration brine is insufficient in this year's autumn drying, the low-concentration brine has increased by more than 250,000 cubic meters compared with last year. If measures are taken to increase the brine concentration as soon as possible, it is certain that the plan can be completed.

Ensuring a bumper harvest in autumn drying is the key to overfulfilling this year's sea salt production plan. Salt workers are firmly grasping the two important measures of mastering the weather and raising more brine, accelerating the repair of beaches, brine production, and pond irrigation. At the same time, they listen to meteorological forecasts six times a day and guide production according to the weather. The workers have also come up with a series of methods to increase the concentration of brine. Many workers use the time when the evaporation is highest at noon to rush to make brine, striving for a bumper harvest in autumn drying.

    新华社南京5日电　党的八届八中全会公报和决议传到江苏省黄海边，给战斗在千里盐滩的职工增添了新的力量。全省二十二个盐场的一万多名盐业工人，轰轰烈烈地掀起了秋季“百日大战”，争取提前在9月份完成今年产盐一百四十四万吨的计划，迎接国庆十周年。
    江苏省各制盐场工人在大战8月中，创造了史无前例的战绩，全月生产原盐二十六万七千多吨，超过计划一点六倍。盐业工人们响应党的号召，斗志昂扬，纷纷开展了场与场、工区与工区、组与组、个人与个人之间的对手竞赛，决心苦干、实干加巧干，在大战9月中再创奇迹。新海连盐场庆福圩先进小组，在8月份已超额36％提前完成了今年的产盐计划。小组长顾立成说：“我们一定要争时间抢阳光，多产盐。”他们每天天还没有亮就上滩戽卤、种盐，保证9月份再增产原盐八千担，实现今年一年完成两年计划。全国先进生产者朱景云所领导的小组的工人们在听到公报和决议的当天，共种了一百二十块盐田；比平常增加四十多块。他所在的盐场到8月份已产盐五十三万五千吨，完成全年计划88％以上。盐场领导上根据职工们的意见，决定今年增产原盐八万五千吨。
    最近，各盐场普遍降雨。盐场工人们加强了雨季作业，在雨前雨后作好保卤工作，使盐卤不受或少受损失。他们冒雨排除淡水，做到随下随排，保证雨一停场子就干，立即灌池结晶。
    新华社杭州5日电　正在与不利的自然条件作斗争的浙江沿海五万盐业工人，听到党中央的伟大战斗号召，干劲更足，决心在8月份原盐产量日日上升的基础上，乘胜前进，增产更多的原盐。
    第三季度是浙江沿海产盐旺季。但是今年雨水多，潮汛大，台风暴雨几次侵袭，对露天操作的盐业生产非常不利。盐业工人们为了增产原盐，支援国民经济的继续跃进，坚决向台风、洪水、旱灾作斗争，掀起了多产盐、产好盐，千方百计开辟卤源的竞赛热潮。全省沿海二十个产盐的县、市，有十五个成立了盐业生产指挥部，不少县的县委书记、公社党委书记亲到盐场参加战斗，和盐场工人们一起战胜自然灾害。临海盐场防潮坝发生缺口，临海县委的领导干部带领职工苦战三昼夜，堵住了缺口，争取全面开晒。舟山县盐区投入抗台风斗争的共有九千三百六十九人次，抢修海塘一万三千三百二十七米，抢挑咸泥十一万六千四百多担，大大提高了盐田的开晒率。许多盐场的工人们，为了保持海水晒盐的浓度数，采取天旱用潮头的淡海水、汛潮大时用潮尾的浓海水的办法，并且严格管理水闸，保证了久晴不缺潮，雨后淡水不积存在盐田内。温岭县下墩、新河等盐场，组织力量开挖引潮沟。新河公社光辉生产队的社员白天晒盐，晚上开沟，同时组织三百零四人轮班日夜车淡海水，使全部盐坦、水库都满贮海水。庵东人民公社盐场全体职工想出各种办法增加卤源，使盐产量日日上升。为了加速晒盐速度，职工们改进工具、设备和操作方法，加强气象预报工作，充分利用自然蒸发力，增加生产。
    浙江省8月份以来，原盐生产日日上升。8月下旬头五天原盐产量达到三千六百一十九吨，比中旬十天的产量提高36.62％，8月1日到25日的盐产量比去年8月全月产量还多4.78％。
    据新华社讯　福建沿海盐民决心用战胜暴风雨灾害，增产更多的海盐的实际行动，响应党的八届八中全会的号召。福建沿海各盐场和盐业生产队纷纷召开群众大会，订出战胜秋季风雨灾害，完成和超额完成全年生产指标的计划和措施，决心增产更多更好的海盐。东山盐场的一千三百多名干部和盐民，决心在上半年超额44％完成国家计划的基础上，再生产海盐一百一十五万担，来庆祝国庆十周年，庆祝总路线、大跃进和人民公社的光辉成就。同安、南安和莆田等盐场的盐民，也已迅速掀起比产量、比质量、比综合利用、比工效、比基建进度、比安全生产的竞赛高潮。
    在8月23日和30日先后遭受十二级以上台风和暴雨袭击的厦门、海澄等地盐民，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，决心用迅速恢复生产、完成和超额完成原订计划，夺回风灾损失等实际行动，来答谢党和政府无微不至的关怀。从8月28日到30日奋战三天，在台风和暴雨袭击下保证盐场和二千八百万斤食盐基本未受损失的惠安盐场的盐民们，在风雨过后的第一天，就迅速修复部分被损坏的盐坎和设备，恢复了正常生产。
    新华社天津5日电　河北省长芦盐区塘沽盐场的职工，决心战胜雨水多、高浓度卤水少的困难，力争超额完成今年的海盐生产任务，使今年的年产量超过历史上海盐产量最高的1958年。
    党的八届八中全会的战斗号召传到勃海湾的盐滩上，塘沽盐场的万余职工连日集会，讨论修订了今年的增产计划，随即开展了紧张的秋晒战斗。全场半数以上的结晶池已开始结晶，从9月1日到3日生产了新盐一千一百七十吨，为打好今年秋晒的最后一仗奠定了基础。
    今年塘沽盐场因受多雨的影响，头八个月的产量只达全年计划的74.56％，比去年同期减少两万四千吨。同时，高浓度卤水也比去年减少了七十三万五千多立方米，因此部分干部对完成今年的生产计划缺乏信心。党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布后，这个盐场的领导干部一面检查和批判了松劲情绪，一面放手发动群众。全体盐业工人经过反复讨论，分析了当前生产中的有利条件，指出今年秋晒中高浓度卤水虽然不足，但是低浓度卤水却比去年增加了二十五万多立方米，如果采取措施，使卤水浓度尽快提高，完成计划是有把握的。
    保证秋晒大丰收，是超额完成今年海盐生产计划的关键。盐工们正紧紧抓住掌握天时、多养卤水两个重要措施，加速修滩、制卤和灌池。同时，每天收听六次气象预报，根据天气指导生产。工人们还想出一系列的办法，提高卤水的浓度。很多工人利用中午蒸发量最高的时刻，赶制卤水，力争秋晒大丰收。
