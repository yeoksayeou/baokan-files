Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 11th: Tianjin Triumphantly Completes Industrial Production Plan for the First Ten Days of September; Steel Plant No. 1 Overproduces 180 Tons of Steel

    This newspaper reports that, by the 10th, Tianjin had triumphantly completed its industrial production plan for the first ten days of September, with a total output value increase of 78% compared to the first ten days of August.

    Inspired by the call of the Party Central Committee, workers in Tianjin factories have actively summarized the experiences of the great victory in August production and vigorously promoted technical innovation. The leadership of the Agricultural Machinery Factory proposed more than fifty topics and mobilized the masses to tackle key problems. Gao Xiuwen and a dozen other workers in the carpentry workshop, based on these topics, successfully researched and developed four major innovations. Among them, the use of a surface planer to replace manual operation increased efficiency by forty times, and the splicing machine increased efficiency by twelve times. The factory completed its output value plan for the first ten days of September one day ahead of schedule, with a 30.2% increase in output value compared to the last ten days of August. Workers at the Xinhe Shipbuilding and Repair Plant implemented forty-three relatively important technical innovation measures within eight days, doubling production efficiency and completing the plan for the first ten days two days ahead of schedule. Dong Zhengcai's team in the riveting workshop, which was making mine car axles, could only make two a day with four people. After research, the team created a die, allowing three people to make one hundred a day. Employees of the Hui Fu Pharmaceutical Factory put forward more than 1,500 innovation proposals in a few days, of which 151 have already been implemented. The alanine workshop used to frequently leak hydrochloric acid gas, affecting operations. Now, the installation of a suction pump has solved this problem, immediately increasing daily output from 120 kilograms to 180 kilograms.

    The wave of factories competing with, learning from, and catching up with advanced models is rising higher and higher, and new production records are constantly emerging. The Tianjin Elevator Factory, under the premise of guaranteeing product quality, launched a "thousand-minute competition." In the first ten days of September, 60% of the factory's workers reached or exceeded the "thousand-minute" quota, and the entire factory completed the production plan for the first ten days of September three days ahead of schedule.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 11th: Employees of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1 fully overfulfilled the production plan for the first ten days of September on the 10th. Steel production exceeded the state plan by 180 tons, and the qualification rate increased from 98.38% in August to 99%; steel products exceeded the state plan by 1,500 tons, and the average daily production level increased by 44.31% compared to August.

    "Shortening time is a major victory." This is the action slogan of the steelmaking workers of this factory in the great battle of September. They have proposed a guarantee to complete the annual steel production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule and the annual steel product production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule, and challenged Anshan Iron and Steel Group. The entire factory immediately launched a wave of "counterpart competitions," "opponent competitions," and "leap forward competitions," learning from each other, chasing each other, and making the team output and daily output records constantly refreshed. By the 9th, the entire factory had seen twenty-four new records. The Qi Zisheng team of No. 1 open hearth furnace in the steelmaking department set a record of smelting a furnace of steel in five minutes and forty-five seconds on the 3rd; the Yu Junyou team, taking over the shift, held a pre-furnace meeting to learn from their advanced experience, and as a result, smelted a furnace of steel in only five minutes and nineteen seconds; the next day, the Wang Qifa team, taking over the shift, absorbed the experience of the previous two shifts and created a new record by smelting a furnace of steel in five minutes and twelve seconds. The average smelting time per furnace for this open hearth in the first ten days of September has been shortened from seven hours and eight minutes in August to six hours and thirty-nine minutes.

    The entire factory's office staff also joined the battle to seize steel. On September 4, workers in the B shift of the steel rolling workshop in the seventh branch factory discovered that the gear of the steel rolling machine was broken and needed to be dismantled and replaced. The workers immediately carried out repairs. Upon hearing the news, office cadres, medical personnel, and others immediately organized a temporary team to join the battle, resulting in the recovery of more than 39 tons of steel for the country.

    天津胜利完成上旬工业生产计划
    第一钢厂多产了一百八十吨钢
    本报讯　到10日止，天津市已胜利完成上旬工业生产计划，总产值比8月上旬增加78％。
    天津市各工厂职工为党中央号召所鼓舞，纷纷总结8月生产大捷的经验，大闹技术革新。农业机械厂领导方面提出五十多个课题，发动群众围攻关键。木工车间高秀文等十几个工人根据课题，研究成功四项重大革新，其中以平面刨代替手工操作，效率提高四十倍，拼缝机提高效率十二倍。全厂提前一天完成了9月上旬产值计划，比8月下旬的产值增长了30.2％。新河船舶修造厂的工人们，在8天内实现了四十三项比较重要的技术革新措施，生产效率成倍提高，提前两天完成了上旬计划。铆工车间董正才小组做矿车主轴，原来四个人一天只能做两个，经过小组研究，制成了一个胎具，三个人一天就可以做一百个。惠符制药厂职工在几天内就提出一千五百多件革新建议，其中已实现一百五十一件。?胺车间过去经常跑盐酸气，影响操作，现在安装一台抽气泵，解决了这个问题，日产量立即由一百二十公斤提高到一百八十公斤。
    各厂比先进、学先进、赶先进竞赛的浪潮越来越高，生产新纪录不断出现。天津电梯厂在保证产品质量的前提下，开展了“千分钟竞赛”，9月上旬，全厂有60％的工人达到或超过了“千分钟”定额，全厂提前三天完成了9月上旬的生产计划。
    据新华社天津11日电　天津第一钢厂职工在10日全面超额完成了上旬生产计划。钢比国家计划多产了一百八十吨，合格率由8月份的98.38％提高到99％；钢材比国家计划多产了一千五百吨，平均日产水平比8月份增长44.31％。
    “缩短时间就是重大的胜利。”这是这个厂炼钢工人大战9月份的行动口号。他们提出了提前十五天完成全年钢产计划和提前十七天完成全年钢材生产计划的保证，向鞍钢应战。全厂职工立即掀起了“对口赛”“对手赛”“跃进赛”的热潮，互相学习，你追我赶，使班产量、日产量纪录不断刷新，到9日全厂共出现了二十四项新纪录。炼钢部一号平炉的齐子升小组，3日创造五点四十五分钟炼一炉钢的纪录；接班的于俊有小组就开炉前会，学习他们的先进经验，结果只用五点十九分炼出一炉钢；第二天接班的王起发小组，又吸取上两班的经验，以五点十二分炼一炉钢创造了更新的纪录。这个平炉9月上旬平均每炉熔炼时间，已由8月份的七小时零八分钟缩短为六小时三十九分钟。
    全厂科室人员也投入了夺钢大战。9月4日，七分厂压钢车间乙班工人发现压钢机的牙轮坏了，必需拆换。工人们马上进行检修，科室干部、医务人员等闻讯，也立即组织一支临时队伍投入战斗，结果为国家夺回三十九吨多钢材。
