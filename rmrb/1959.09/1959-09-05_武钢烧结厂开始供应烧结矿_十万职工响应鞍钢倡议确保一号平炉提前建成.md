Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's sintering plant has gone into production two days ahead of schedule. At 11:30 PM on the 29th, its No. 1 sintering machine produced its first batch of red-hot sintered ore. Soon, Wuhan Iron and Steel's two modern, large blast furnaces will be able to "eat refined grains." The sintering plant is an important link in the Wuhan Iron and Steel's ironmaking system. Its task is to process powdery ore into artificial rich ore, creating favorable conditions for high-quality and high-yield blast furnaces. The first phase of the Wuhan Iron and Steel sintering plant project has a total of four sintering machines, and the one put into production on the 29th was the first.

Since the spring of this year, Wuhan Iron and Steel has been using the experience of the Great Leap Forward to concentrate superior forces and accelerate the construction of the sintering plant. Its main plant building is the "heart" of the entire plant, and would normally take one year and four months to build; however, Wuhan Iron and Steel only took half a year from the start of construction to the commissioning of the No. 1 sintering machine, with excellent engineering quality. In order to gain time, the builders first adopted the construction method of construction and installation proceeding simultaneously, carrying out multi-layer parallel flow and cross-operations on a vertical plane. As soon as the civil engineering workers built the platform, the installation workers used cranes to install metal components and equipment without waiting to build the roof or build the surrounding walls. Old worker Zhang Shutang promoted the advanced bricklaying method of using double push rulers, which allowed the bricklaying task of the central dispatch room to be completed three days ahead of schedule. After studying the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiment, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," the workers' enthusiasm became even greater, and they worked day and night to test the machine and strive to put the project into production ahead of schedule.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel sintering plant was designed with the help of the Soviet Union. It incorporates the latest Soviet technological achievements. From feeding to finished products, the production is continuous and remotely controlled, making the workers both safe and less strenuous. The cooling device it uses is also the latest in China. The advantage of using a cooling device is that it prevents the furnace top equipment from being damaged under high-pressure operation, which is important for increasing pig iron production.

Most of the equipment for the Wuhan Iron and Steel sintering plant was manufactured by more than 40 machinery factories in Shenyang, Harbin, Shanghai and other places in China.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 4th: 100,000 workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company have responded to the initiative of Anshan Iron and Steel and launched a socialist labor competition to jointly strive to complete and overfulfill the national steel production target of 12 million tons.

In the challenge letter sent to Anshan Iron and Steel on September 3, Wuhan Iron and Steel workers proposed to realize their company's annual production targets for steel, iron, and coke ahead of schedule, accelerate the construction of various projects, and ensure that the No. 1 open hearth furnace is completed and produces steel in October. Production and construction tasks such as ore, refractory materials, and basic construction equipment are also correspondingly completed ahead of schedule.

The challenge letter stated that the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy have given tremendous encouragement and strength to all their workers. At present, a vigorous and lively mass movement and a new situation of production leap forward are rapidly forming throughout the company. In August, the completed construction and installation workload exceeded the monthly plan by 19.5%, especially in the last ten days of the month, when the work equivalent to the first and middle ten days of the month was completed. The seven major projects of ore dressing, sintering, coking, ironmaking, refractory materials, steelmaking, and steel rolling all overfulfilled the construction plan. In terms of production, Daye Iron Mine overfulfilled the August plan by 4,000 tons. The output of steel, iron, and coke all increased by ten-day periods. Compared with July, steel production increased by 11%, iron production increased by 12.5%, and coke production increased by 13.6%. They expressed that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, they will resolutely oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost their energy, fight hard in September, fight hard in the fourth quarter, and set off a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, in order to respond to the Party's call with even more outstanding achievements and present a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The challenge letter also put forward specific measures to achieve the above goals and emphasized learning from advanced units and learning from Anshan Iron and Steel.

    武钢烧结厂开始供应烧结矿
    十万职工响应鞍钢倡议确保一号平炉提前建成
    新华社武汉讯　武汉钢铁公司烧结厂已经比原计划提前两天投入生产。29日晚上十一点半，它的一号烧结机第一次吐出了红通通的烧结矿。不久，武钢两座现代化的大型高炉就可以吃到“细粮”了。烧结厂是武钢炼铁体系的重要环节。它的任务是，把粉矿加工成人造富矿，为高炉优质高产创造有利条件。武钢烧结厂的第一期工程共有四台烧结机，29日投入生产的是第一台烧结机。
    武钢从今年春天起就运用大跃进的经验，集中优势力量，加速建设烧结厂。它的主厂房是全厂的“心脏”，一般得建设一年零四个月；而武钢从开工到一号烧结机投入生产，总共只用了半年时间，工程质量优良。建设者们为了赢得时间，首先采用了建筑跟安装齐头并进的施工方法，在一个垂直面上进行了多层平行流水交叉作业。只要土建工人筑好平台，不等盖房顶、砌围墙，安装工人就利用吊车安装金属构件和设备。老工人张树堂推广了双推尺的先进砌砖方法，使集中调度室的砌砖任务提前三天完成。在学习人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论以后，工人的干劲愈鼓愈足，更是日夜进行试车工作，努力使这项工程提前投入生产。
    武钢烧结厂是苏联帮助我国设计的。它集中了苏联最新的技术成就，从上料到出成品，都是连续生产，远距离操纵，工人既安全又省力。它所采用的冷却装置也是我国最新的。采用冷却装置的优点，是使高炉在高压操作下不致损坏炉顶设备，对于增加生铁产量具有重要作用。
    武钢烧结厂的绝大部分设备，是我国沈阳、哈尔滨、上海等地的四十多个机械工厂制造的。
    新华社武汉4日电　武汉钢铁公司十万职工响应鞍钢倡议，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，为保证完成和超额完成全国一千二百万吨钢的生产任务而共同奋斗。
    武钢职工在9月3日向鞍钢发出的应战书中提出，要提前实现他们公司钢、铁、焦炭的全年生产指标，加快各项工程的建设，确保一号平炉在10月份建成出钢。矿石、耐火材料、基本建设设备等生产建设任务也相应地提前完成。
    应战书中说，党的八届八中全会的公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议，给了他们全体职工以巨大鼓舞和力量。目前，一个声势浩大、生动活泼的群众运动和新的生产跃进的局面正在全公司范围内迅速形成。8月份，完成的建筑安装工作量超过了月计划的19.5％，特别是下旬，完成了相当于上中两旬的任务。选矿、烧结、焦化、炼铁、耐火、炼钢、轧钢七大主体工程，都超额完成建设计划。生产方面，大冶铁矿超额四千吨完成了8月份计划，钢、铁、焦炭的产量都旬旬上升，8月份和7月份比较，钢产量增长11％，铁产量增长12.5％，焦炭产量增长13.6％。他们表示在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，坚决反右倾，鼓干劲，大战9月份，大战四季度，掀起增产节约运动新高潮，以更加优异的成绩来响应党的号召，向国庆十周年献礼。
    应战书中还提出了实现上述指标的具体措施，并且强调向先进单位学习，向鞍钢学习。
