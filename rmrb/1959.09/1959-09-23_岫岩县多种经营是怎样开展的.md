Editor's Note: Xiuyan County's experience in developing a diversified economy is very good. Their experience proves that developing a diversified economy will not only not affect agricultural production, but also promote the development of agricultural production. Due to the unprecedented development of diversified economy, the county expects the total income from diversified economy for the whole year to increase by nearly double compared with 1956, the highest in history, with an average income of 1,746 yuan per household. Their methods for developing a diversified economy are: strengthening leadership by the Party Committee, combining the establishment of professional teams with launching mass movements, engaging in small-scale efforts during busy farming seasons and large-scale efforts during slack farming seasons, and combining seasonal offensives with year-round persistence, and close cooperation between agricultural and commercial departments. Currently, it is the busy season of the "three autumns." In order to ensure that while doing a good job in agricultural production, we do not relax in developing a diversified economy, it is particularly necessary for Party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over diversified economy, rationally arrange labor based on the principle of engaging in small-scale efforts during busy farming seasons and large-scale efforts during slack farming seasons, and comprehensively develop agricultural and sideline production.

This year's diversified economy in Xiuyan County, under the premise of focusing on meat and vegetables, has shown an unprecedented leap forward, developing more, faster, and better than any previous year. As of July 31, the income from diversified economy was more than 4.6 million yuan (excluding self-produced and self-sold portions, township-run industries, and large-scale income from tobacco and tussah silkworm), with an average income of 72.5 yuan per household, an increase of 1.1 times compared with the same period last year. The income from diversified economy in some communes and production teams has doubled. For example, the Paifang Production Team of the Hongqi People's Commune had an acquisition amount of 16,274 yuan for local and sideline products alone in the first half of the year, an increase of 1.9 times compared with the acquisition amount in the same period last year. The reasons for the good development of diversified economy are:

(1) Putting politics in command, strengthening leadership, and establishing a professional front.

Xiuyan is a mountainous area with many mountains, many rivers, and abundant resources, suitable for developing a diversified economy; the masses have always had the habit of relying on the mountains and the experience of managing sideline production; the large-scale people's commune combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrating government and commune, has opened up a broad road for vigorously developing a diversified economy. These extremely favorable conditions were not understood by most cadres at the beginning of the year. Therefore, in January and February, except for a few communes and teams, the diversified economy was not doing well in the county as a whole. The main reasons were: a large number of cadres were afraid that engaging in diversified economy would affect agricultural production; they had great resistance to the county committee's proposal of "taking grain as the key link, vigorously developing a diversified economy, and comprehensively developing mountainous area production"; they excessively emphasized difficulties such as lack of time and insufficient labor.

The county committee seized these thoughts and repeatedly used forms such as airing views freely, large-scale debates, big-character posters, and organizing on-site visits to criticize those right-leaning conservative thoughts that could not see the favorable conditions and were not actively exploring labor potential. On the basis of unifying thoughts and correcting understanding, each commune made unified and rational arrangements for the existing labor force through methods of digging, exchanging, and combining three elements, mobilizing all labor potential that could be mobilized.

In order to not affect the leap forward in agricultural production and not weaken the development of sideline production, it is necessary to open up a professional front for diversified economy. The county's twelve people's communes have established a total of 2,787 professional teams, groups, and farms, with 15,279 laborers engaged in diversified economy, accounting for 15.5% of the total agricultural labor force. According to the principle of "large-scale efforts during slack farming seasons and small-scale efforts during busy farming seasons," different organizational forms of labor were adopted for different production projects: pigs, poultry, bees, and rabbits were raised in a combination of centralized breeding in professional farms and decentralized breeding by commune members; fruits, silkworms, vegetables, and fish were managed in a combination of long-term specialization and seasonal offensives; mountain products were managed in a combination of fixed arrangements and flexible deployment; the collection of scattered, sporadic wild dried and fresh fruits and wild medicinal plants was carried out through the method of regular holidays and concentrated production. These forms ensured the labor force necessary for agricultural production and promoted the comprehensive development of diversified economy, breaking through the bottleneck of labor shortage.

Party committees at all levels have universally strengthened their leadership over diversified economy. From the commune to the production team, unified leadership, unified arrangement, unified deployment, and unified inspection were implemented. The secretaries of the commune, production team, and small team were all in charge, with a commune director, team leader, and small team leader in charge of this work. In order to strengthen the leadership of diversified economy, the county committee added a non-staple food production department at the beginning of the year and established a diversified economy production and sales committee to specifically lead the development of diversified economy.

In terms of leadership methods, universally from top to bottom, the method of grasping basic points to lead the general and vigorously developing experimental fields was adopted. Many commune party committees, while engaging in agricultural experimental fields, also engaged in some experimental fields in diversified economy and established non-staple food production bases. Because the base production is concentrated, experienced, high-yielding, and has a high commodity rate, it has become the main position for developing non-staple food production and a backbone force driving the general. The county, communes, and teams all selected one or two places with suitable conditions to establish production bases for vegetables, pigs, poultry, etc. Party committees at all levels also promoted the experience accumulated in basic points and experimental fields to the whole area in a timely and accurate manner through on-site meetings, experience exchange meetings, and other forms, resulting in widespread success. The county committee has held three on-site meetings on pig raising and vegetable growing in the past six months.

(2) Dividing the scope of operation, "walking on two legs," and launching a mass movement.

Xiuyan County has many items and contents of diversified economy, with more than 20 categories and more than 1,000 kinds. Some are suitable for centralized management, some are suitable for decentralized management, and some are suitable for a combination of centralized and decentralized management. Therefore, the combination of collective management and decentralized management, and the implementation of the policy of walking on two legs, is very important. However, some cadres had very inconsistent understandings at the beginning. Some cadres insisted that only "the brigade can do more, the team can do less, and commune members are not allowed to do it privately." They believed that collective management could unify labor arrangements, and the income would belong to the collective, which was beneficial to collective production. If commune members were allowed to engage in decentralized management, there would be conflicts in the use of labor, which would be detrimental to collective production. However, most cadres advocated "the brigade should do it, the team should do it, and the commune members should also do it." They believed that only in this way could the enthusiasm of production organizations at all levels and commune members be mobilized, so that the diversified economy could be rapidly developed, which would be beneficial to promoting agricultural production, supporting industrial construction, and increasing commune members' income. Therefore, the county committee convened a meeting in early May with cadres from communes, brigades, teams, and activists of commune members to conduct a large-scale debate on the issue of "walking on two legs." According to the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, the scope of operation was clearly divided: all large-scale, high-investment, high-income, and suitable for collective management, such as lime kilns, charcoal burning, and rubber-wheeled transport, were uniformly managed by the brigade; although large-scale, but suitable for decentralized management, and easy to combine with agricultural production, such as tool handles and iron-wheeled transport, were delegated to the production team for management; all kinds of small-scale, sporadic sideline production, such as weaving, hunting, collecting mountain fruits, and digging medicinal herbs, were managed by the production team and commune members individually, and the income belonged to whoever managed it. In the production of livestock and poultry, the policy of "walking on two legs" of public raising and private raising was conscientiously implemented. In terms of the time for commune members to engage in household sideline production, the central government's instructions on holidays were generally implemented. These measures went deep into the hearts of the people and greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels and the vast number of commune members to engage in sideline production. Therefore, engaging in sideline production not only did not affect agricultural production, but also strongly supported the greater leap forward in agricultural production in terms of funds, fertilizers, and livestock power. Although Xiuyan County has always been considered a poor mountainous area with many mountains, little land, thin soil, and thick rocks, this year's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery are all thriving, and the whole county presents a scene of prosperity. According to statistics at the end of July: the number of pigs has reached 71,236, an increase of nearly half compared with the beginning of the year, and an increase of 11% compared with the end of last year; there are more than 270,000 poultry, an increase of more than two times compared with the beginning of the year; large livestock, goats, domestic rabbits, and freshwater fish farming have also increased by tens of percent, one time, and several times. A mass production upsurge of commune raising, team raising, everyone raising pigs and chickens, and organs, enterprises, schools, and everywhere running farms has been formed throughout the county. This year's fruits and mountain fruits are even more abundant. The yield of wild medicinal herbs and mushrooms can increase by one or two times compared with last year due to the many heavy rains and normal climate this year. It is currently entering the peak season for collecting mountain products. From July 18 to August 22, the county picked 6 million catties of mountain pears and hazelnuts, and the supply and marketing cooperatives were crowded with people buying and selling in the morning and evening, and the rural economy was completely new.

At present, many commune, team cadres and commune members are calculating the income accounts of their own communes, teams and families with excitement. The Watang Production Team expects its total income this year to reach 300,670 yuan, including 78,800 yuan in agricultural income and 227,870 yuan in other diversified business income. The income from diversified business is 1.9 times higher than the agricultural income. The average net income per person in the whole team is 96.9 yuan, an increase of 1.5 times compared with last year. It is a noteworthy new problem that the average income per person in a mountain gully production team with barren soil is close to 100 yuan. For mountainous areas, it is not possible to make the per capita income close to 100 yuan by relying on agriculture alone. It is necessary to comprehensively develop the mountainous economy under the premise of focusing on agriculture, asking the land for grain and asking the mountains for money, eating the grain in the fields and spending the money on the mountains. Because the peak season for diversified operations is not in the first half of the year, but in the last half of the year in the four months of August, September, November and December. These months are the great opportunity for mountain goods to go down the mountain, products to be sold, and agricultural affairs to be relatively idle. As long as we continue to work hard, strengthen leadership, make overall plans, arrange comprehensively, and the diversified operations in the second half of the year will surely have a greater leap. It is estimated that the total income of diversified operations in the county this year (excluding township-run industries, tobacco and tussah silkworm) can reach 11 million yuan, and the average income per household can reach 1,746 yuan, nearly double the highest in history in 1956.

(3) Combining agriculture and commerce, cooperating closely, and closely linking production and sales.

Because the commodity nature of diversified operations is very large, if the products produced have no sales channels, it will cause waste of human and material resources, bring losses to production, and affect the enthusiasm of the commune members. The cadres and commune members also have concerns about being unable to sell the products if they produce too much. Therefore, while mobilizing production, Party committees at all levels paid attention to organizing supply and marketing cooperatives and developing departmental business starting from the development of production. The county supply and marketing cooperative and grassroots cooperatives sent cadres to the production teams to help explore production potential, find ways, and make plans. Through planning, production and sales contracts were signed, and the contracts were signed to the team and household, so that the scattered sideline production was included in the national plan, and production was carried out in a planned and guided manner, further mobilizing and encouraging the enthusiasm of the commune members. At the same time, in order to facilitate producers and promote the rapid development of production, the style of waiting for customers at the door was reversed in the acquisition method. The grassroots cooperatives generally established three to five acquisition points or agency collection points within their own operating areas, achieving on-site production, on-site acquisition, on-site packaging, and on-site shipment. For example, the Daying Supply and Marketing Cooperative, through the "four on-site" method, acquired 800,000 catties of charcoal, 37,000 pairs of earth baskets, and more than 90,000 various tool handles in the Shajin Production Team, with a total amount of more than 120,000 yuan. The grassroots cooperatives also adopted methods such as technicians going to the countryside to guide, product samples going to the countryside to guide, and market quotations and specifications going to the countryside to guide, which played a positive role in promoting production and improving product quality.

Although Xiuyan County has achieved the above achievements and experience in diversified operations in the first half of the year, compared with the requirements of the provincial and municipal party committees and the favorable conditions of our county, our work is still far behind. Therefore, we will thoroughly examine and criticize the right-leaning conservative thoughts existing in the development of diversified operations through the great movement of anti-rightism, encouraging hard work, and practicing increased production and thrift, and work harder to resolve to rely on the masses and strengthen leadership under the leadership of the provincial and municipal party committees, and continue to comprehensively carry out diversified operations while doing a good job in grain production.

    岫岩县多种经营是怎样开展的
    中共辽宁岫岩县委会
    编者按：岫岩县开展多种经营的经验很好。他们的经验证明：开展多种经营，不但不会影响农业生产，而且能促进农业生产的发展。由于多种经营空前发展，全县预计全年多种经营总收入可比历史上最高的1956年增加近一倍，每户平均能收入一千七百四十六元。他们开展多种经营的方法是：党委加强领导，建立专业队伍和大搞群众运动相结合，农忙小搞、农闲大搞，季节突击和常年坚持相结合，农业和商业部门通力协作。当前正是“三秋”大忙时期，为了保证在做好农业生产的同时，也不放松多种经营，这就特别需要各级党委对多种经营加强领导，根据农忙小搞、农闲大搞的原则，合理安排劳力，全面发展农副业生产。
    今年岫岩县的多种经营，在以肉菜为纲的前提下，出现了一个空前跃进的新形势，比过去任何一年发展的都多都快都好。截至7月31日统计，多种经营的收入就有四百六十多万元（不包括自产自销部分、社办工业和大宗收入的烟草柞蚕），平均每户收入七十二点五元，比去年同时期增加一点一倍。有一些公社和生产队多种经营的收入成双倍地增长。如红旗人民公社牌坊生产队，上半年仅多种经营中的土副产品一项，收购金额就达到一万六千二百七十四元，和去年同时期收购额相比提高一点九倍。多种经营搞得好的原因是：
    （一）政治挂帅，加强领导，建立专业战线。
    岫岩是个多山、多河、资源丰富，适于发展多种经营的山区；群众历来就有靠山吃山的习惯和经营副业生产的经验；大规模的工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社，为大力发展多种经营开辟了广阔的道路。这些极为有利的条件，在年初并没有被大多数的干部所了解。因此，在1、2两个月份里，除少数社、队外，就全县来看，多种经营搞得很不好。主要原因是：有很大一部分干部怕搞多种经营影响农业生产；对县委提出的“以粮为纲，大搞多种经营，全面发展山区生产”的要求，有很大抵触情绪；他们过分的强调没有时间、劳力不足等困难。
    县委抓住了这些思想，反复运用了大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报和组织现场参观等形式，批判了那些看不到有利条件和不积极去挖掘劳动潜力的右倾保守思想。在统一思想、端正认识的基础上，各公社都通过一挖、两换、三结合的办法，对现有劳动力作了统一的合理安排，能文搞文，能武搞武，充分调动了一切可以调动的劳动潜力。
    为了既不影响农业生产跃进，也不削弱副业生产的发展，必须开辟一条多种经营的专业战线。全县十二个人民公社共建立了二千七百八十七个专业队、组、场，从事多种经营的劳动力有一万五千二百七十九人，占农业总劳力的15.5％。根据“农闲大搞、农忙小搞”的原则，对不同的生产项目，采取了不同的劳动组织形式：猪、禽、蜂、兔，采取专业场集中饲养和发动社员分散饲养相结合；果、蚕、菜、鱼，采取长年专业和季节性突击相结合；山货采取固定安排和灵活调配相结合；分散、零星的野生干鲜果和野生药材植物的采集，采取定期放假、突击生产的办法。这样一些形式，既保证了农业生产所必需的劳动力，又促进了多种经营的全面发展，突破了劳力不足关。
    各级党委普遍的加强了对多种经营的领导。从公社到生产小队都实行统一领导，统一安排，统一部署，统一检查。公社、生产队、小队都由书记挂帅，并有一名社长、队长、小队长分管这项工作。县委为了加强多种经营的领导，在年初就增设了副食品生产部，并成立了多种经营产销委员会，具体领导发展多种经营。
    在领导方法上，从上到下普遍地采取了抓基点带一般，大搞试验田。不少公社党委在搞农业试验田的同时，也搞了一些多种经营方面的试验田，并建立了副食品生产基地。因为基地生产集中、经验丰富、产量大、商品率高，便成了发展副食品生产的主要阵地，也是带动一般的骨干力量。县、社、队都选择了一、二处有条件的地方建立了蔬菜、生猪、家禽等生产基地。各级党委并通过现场会、经验交流会等形式，及时准确地把基点和试验田中积累的经验，推广全面，遍地开花结果。县委半年来共召开了三次养猪、种菜等现场会。
    （二）划分经营范围，“两条腿走路”，大搞群众运动。
    岫岩县的多种经营的项目和内容很多，有二十多类，一千余种。有的适于集中搞，有的适于分散搞，有的适于集中和分散相结合。因此，集体经营和分散经营相结合，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，就显得十分重要。可是，有一些干部，在开始时认识很不一致。有一部分干部坚持只能“大队多搞，小队少搞，不能允许社员私人搞”。认为集体经营劳力可以统一安排，收益归集体，对集体生产有利。如果允许社员分散经营，劳力使用有矛盾，对集体生产不利。但多数干部都主张“大队搞，小队搞，社员也搞”。认为只有这样才能够调动各级生产组织和社员的积极性，使多种经营迅速的发展起来，对促进农业生产、支援工业建设和增加社员收入都有好处。因此，县委在5月初召开了有公社、大队、小队干部和社员积极分子参加的会议，就“两条腿走路”的问题，开展了一场大辩论。根据统一领导、分级管理的原则，明确地划分了经营范围：凡属大型的、投资大、收入多、适合集体经营的，如石灰窑、烧木炭、胶车运输等，统归大队经营；虽属于大型，但适于分散经营，又便于和农业生产相结合的，如工具把子、铁轮运输等，均下放给生产小队经营；各种小型的、零星的副业生产，如编织、打猎、采山果、挖药材，归生产小队和社员个人经营，谁经营收入就归谁。在家畜家禽生产上，认真贯彻了公养私也养的“两条腿走路”的方针。在社员经营家庭副业生产的时间上，较普遍地执行了中央关于放假的指示。这些措施，深入人心，大大的激发了各级干部和广大社员经营副业生产的积极性。因此，搞副业不仅没有影响农业生产，反而从资金、肥料和畜力等方面有力地支持了农业生产的更大跃进。岫岩县虽是一向被人认为山多地少、土薄石厚的穷山区，可是今年的农林牧副渔业业俱兴，全县呈现一片繁荣兴旺的景象。据7月末统计：生猪已达七万一千二百三十六头，比年初增长近半倍，和去年年底相比，还增加了11％；家禽有二十七万多只，比年初增加两倍多；大牲畜、山羊、家兔、淡水养鱼也都有了百分之几十、一倍和几倍的增长。在全县范围内已经形成了一个社养、队养、人人养猪、鸡，机关办、企业办、学校办、处处办农场的群众性的生产高潮。今年的水果和山果更是大丰收。野生药材和蘑菇的产量，由于今年伏雨多，气候正常，比去年可增产一、二倍。目前正进入采集山货的旺季，从7月18日到8月22日，全县就采摘山梨和榛子六百万斤，供销社早上晚上是人山人海，有卖有买，农村经济万象一新。
    眼下有许多社、队干部和社员都以兴奋的心情算了本社、本队和自己家庭的收入账。洼塘生产队预计今年总收入可达三十万零六千六百七十元，其中农业收入七万八千八百元，其他各项多种经营收入二十二万七千八百七十元，多种经营的收入比农业收入超出了一点九倍；全队平均每人纯收入九十六元九角钱，比去年增加一点五倍。一个土质瘠薄的山沟生产队，每人平均收入接近一百元，这是一个引人注意的新问题。就山区来说，要使每人收入接近一百元，光靠农业是不行的，必须在以农业为主的前提下，全面发展山区经济，向地要粮、向山要钱，吃地里粮、花山上钱。因为多种经营的旺季不在前半年，而在后半年的8、9、11、12四个月，这几个月份正是山货下山、产品出售和农事较闲的大好时机。只要继续鼓足干劲，加强领导，统筹规划，全面安排，下半年的多种经营肯定会有一个更大的飞跃。预计全县今年多种经营总收入（不包括社办工业、烟草和柞蚕）可达一千一百万元，平均每户能收入一千七百四十六元，比历史上最高的1956年增加近一倍。
    （三）农商结合，通力协作，密切产销关系。
    由于多种经营的商品性很大，假如生产出来的产品没有销路，就会造成人力物力上的浪费，给生产带来损失，而且会影响社员的积极性。干部和社员也确有怕产多了销不掉的顾虑。所以各级党委在发动生产的同时，就注意了组织供销社，从发展生产入手，开展部门业务。县供销社和基层社都派出干部，深入到生产队，帮助挖掘生产潜力、找门路、做规划。通过规划签定产销合同，将合同订到队和户，这样就使分散的副业生产，纳入了国家计划之内，有计划的、有指导的进行生产，进一步调动和鼓舞了社员的干劲。同时，为了便利生产者，促进生产的迅速发展，在收购方法上，扭转了守门等客的作风。各基层社在自己的经营区域内，普遍的建立了三至五个收购点或代收点，做到了就地生产、就地收购、就地包装、就地发运。如大营供销社，通过“四就”办法，在沙金生产队共收购木炭八十万斤、土篮子三万七千副、各种工具把子九万多根，金额达十二万多元。各基层社并采取了技术员下乡指导，产品样品下乡指导，行情规格下乡指导等办法，对促进生产和提高产品质量都起到了积极的作用。
    岫岩县的多种经营上半年虽然取得了上述成绩和经验，但和省、市委的要求及我县的有利条件来比较，我们的工作还差的很远。所以，我们将通过反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的伟大运动，彻底检查批判在开展多种经营方面存在的右倾保守思想，鼓足更大的干劲，决心在省、市委的领导下，依靠群众，加强领导，在搞好粮食生产的同时，继续全面地把多种经营开展起来。
