　　A mountain stream in the forest flows out of the valley, singing all the way.

　　Its banks are overgrown with large clumps of ferns with broad, long leaves, and mountain lilies blooming, like red lilies. Large clumps of wild roses grow, with snow-white petals when they bloom, and so much yellow pollen on the stamens. I saw many tiny dragonflies flying among the grass and by the water, stopping to rest on the leaves for a while.

　　There is a water mill on its bank.

　　The clear, white-silk-like stream flows down from the channels between the grass. The water wheel of the mill house, that huge wooden water wheel, welcomes the rushing water, constantly rotating, passionately, diligently rotating. The Young Pioneers from the forest elementary school always like to stand for a while when they pass by here, watching the water wheel spinning, how interesting. The children in the village, hearing that their mothers are going to push the wheelbarrow, pushing the wheat from the public canteen to grind flour, keep pestering them to come here with their mothers. Like the small train on the forest railway, our water mill also attracts the hearts of children so much...

　　The water wheel welcomes the rushing, rustling, snow-white water, rotating and rotating. The scattered water splashes are as bright as pearls...

　　The water wheel rotates, and rotates. Constantly rotating. Like an apron, an apron made of pearls, opening up and trailing the shining wind, movingly dancing when it dances...

　　A mountain stream in the forest flows out of the deep valley, singing all the way.

　　There are flowers and large clumps of ferns on its banks, and dragonflies. There is a water mill on its bank. The water wheel of the water mill is rotating there. When I passed by here, I also stood beside it and watched for a long while. I saw the wheat flour flowing down like milk from the millstone of the mill house, that is the flour for the public canteen. I saw a child, holding onto her mother's clothes, watching the flour flowing down, completely engrossed.

    水磨
  　郭风
    一条森林中的山溪从山谷中流出来，一路唱着歌。
    它的岸边生长着一大丛一大丛的，有阔长叶子的羊齿类植物，开着山丹丹花，好像红色的百合花。生长着大丛的野蔷薇，它开花的时候，雪白的花瓣，花蕊上有那么多黄色花粉。我看见有很多小小蜻蜓，在草丛间和水边飞着，一会儿停在叶上休息。
    它的岸边有一座水磨。
    清澈的，白练似的水流从草丛间的渠道里冲下来。磨房的水轮，那巨大的木质的水轮，迎着冲下来的水流，不断地旋转着，激情地，勤恳地旋转着。森林小学里的红领巾们，经过这里时，总喜欢站上一会，看那水轮旋转着，好有趣呵。村里的小孩子们，听见妈妈要推着独轮车，推着公共食堂的麦子来磨粉，一直缠着，要跟着妈妈一起到这里来。像那森林铁路的小火车一样，我们的水磨房，也多么逗引着孩子们的心……
    那水轮迎着哗哗作响的雪白的水流，旋转着，又旋转着。撒开的水花，像珍珠那么灿烂……
    那水轮旋转着，又旋转着。不断地旋转着。好像一条围裙，一条用珍珠结成的围裙，在舞蹈时，张开着，牵曳着闪亮的风，动人地在飞舞……
    一条森林中的山溪从深谷中流出来，一路唱着歌。
    它的岸边有花和大丛的羊齿类植物，有蜻蜓。它的岸边有一座水磨。水磨的水轮，在那里旋转着。我经过这里的时候，也站在旁边看了大一会。我看见磨房的磨盘里，麦粉像奶汁一般地流下来，那是公共食堂的面粉。我看见一位娃娃，牵着她的妈妈的衣角，看那面粉流下来，看得入神呢。
