    We Have Endless Treasures
    By Luo Xuan, Our Correspondent
    Across our great motherland’s 9.6 million square kilometers, whether on the snowy peaks of high mountains, in the dense and vast forests, on the boundless grasslands, or in the unpredictable deserts, everywhere are the footprints of exploration teams. It is they who have awakened the dormant mountains that have slept for thousands of years; it is they who have made nature's rich mineral resources serve the industrialization of our motherland.
      Good news! Good news!
    Just think, in the short ten years since the founding of New China, how many inspiring reports have come from those desolate mountains and wildernesses, from those who open mountains to seek treasures!
    The continuous expansion of the mining areas of Gongchangling, Daye Iron Mine, and Baiyun Obo Iron Ore, are already capable of building the three major industrial pillars of Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel. Then, more than a hundred iron mines were discovered in Jingtieshan, Panzhihua, Western Hubei, Dangtu, Laiwu, Lanxian, Shilu...
    The news of the discovery of Karamay in 1955 had just spread, and people’s excitement over the complete bankruptcy of the "China Poverty Oil Theory" had not yet subsided, when rows of oil-bearing structures in the Qaidam Basin continued to gush crude oil. The central Sichuan Basin, which accounts for one-third of the area of Sichuan Province, also became a huge oil area in 1958. Even the Songliao Plain in Northeast China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have found oil-bearing structures, which geologists believe are promising oil-bearing areas.
    The tin reserves of the Gejiu tin mine alone are larger than the total tin reserves of the world-famous tin-producing country, Malaysia. Now, large tin deposits of the same scale have been found in a 2,000-kilometer belt in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and even Zhejiang, as well as in the Northwest, Northeast, and other places. Even copper, which reactionary bourgeois scholars asserted that our country lacked, has had more than three thousand new mineral deposit points discovered in the past ten years, among which more than ten large mines, such as Dongchuan and Yimen, each have reserves greater than the estimated national reserves before liberation.
    The exploration harvest of coal, the "grain of industry," is even richer. Now, we not only have two huge coal-bearing areas spanning thousands of kilometers in North and Northeast China, but also have discovered rich new coalfields in Northwest, Southwest, and Central China, and even in provinces south of the Yangtze River, which were previously thought to be impossible to contain coal. It is now estimated that the national coalfield prospective reserves can supply our country for more than 10,000 years of mining.
    In the past, a Briton collected a 1080mm long asbestos and considered it the longest asbestos in the world, placing it in a delicate glass cabinet with the words "Rare Treasure" written on it. Later, this asbestos was displayed in the British Museum, and the person also got the title of "Asbestos King." However, such asbestos is not rare in our country. In 1958, a large asbestos mine found in Shimian County, Sichuan, not only has large reserves and concentrated deposits, allowing open-pit mining, but also has fiber lengths of 1500 to 1800 mm.
    In the past ten years, we have discovered thousands upon thousands of new mineral deposit points; in the past ten years, we have explored 88 kinds of minerals, while old China explored only 18 kinds in more than 30 years. After ten years of exploration, we have leapt from a country with unclear resources and extremely small reserves in the past to a country with extremely rich mineral resource reserves in the world. The proven reserves of tungsten, tin, molybdenum, and antimony are at the forefront of the world. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the proven iron ore available for industrial design will reach 11.4 billion tons, and the proven coal reserves will reach 106 billion tons, which can be used to build 1,000 pairs of coal mines with an annual output of one million tons. The proven reserves of other minerals such as lead, zinc, sulfur, phosphorus, manganese, and aluminum are also among the highest in the world. Even potassium, chromium, nickel, boron, and rare metals used for the development of cutting-edge industries, which were previously considered relatively scarce, have now found many rich mineral deposits. All of these provide sufficient mineral resources for our country's socialist construction.

          The Era of Not Treasuring Treasures
    Our hardworking and brave ancestors had rich experience in prospecting. As early as more than 2,600 years ago, they discovered natural gas in Sichuan and created simple drilling rigs, "drilling wells for springs and extracting brine." The book "Guanzi" in the Spring and Autumn period also records that there were already "467 mountains producing copper and 3,699 mountains producing iron." It can be seen that the mining industry in our country was quite developed at that time. By the time of Emperor Qin Shihuang (more than 200 years BC), someone discovered a coal mine near Nanchang, while in so-called modern civilized Europe, people did not know that coal could burn until the 13th century. The Italian Marco Polo, who traveled to our country after 1275, also said in his travel notes: "The Chinese burn black stones."
    However, our ancestors' rich knowledge of prospecting has not been carried forward in the past hundred years, and modern Western geological science was introduced into our country during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, but it has not been valued and developed. In order to achieve the goal of plundering China, imperialists sent some reactionary scholars to covet our country's rich mineral resources, and on the other hand, fabricated fallacies such as "China is a country with scarce resources," attempting to stifle China's fledgling modern industry.
    At that time, countless treasures were suffocated underground, and countless mines could only become places where wild beasts and storms raged. And some treasure mountains and treasure caves that had long been discovered by the working people and were widely circulated among the people did not attract the attention of the rulers at that time.
    The people on the Inner Mongolia grassland had long regarded Baiyun Obo as a magical treasure mountain, and there was a mythical story circulating there: Seven hundred years ago, Genghis Khan came here on horseback. As soon as he climbed the mountainside of the mountain standing on the grassland, his brave horse stopped and could not move. Genghis Khan pulled the reins and clamped the horse's belly hard with his legs, but the horse still could not move an inch. At that time, the people on the grassland regarded this mountain as a treasure mountain, buried the bones of their heroes here, and held grand sacrifices every year. In 1917, geologist Ding Daoheng discovered this treasure mountain when he passed by here with a scientific expedition, estimating the ore reserves to be about 100 million tons. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government scolded this discovery as nonsense and changed the reserves to 20 million tons without any basis.
    There was also such a story in Karamay: More than ten years before the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, an old Uyghur hunter came to the vicinity of the current oil city in pursuit of wild animals and found a strange hill more than ten feet high standing on the vast Gobi Desert. There was an oil pool on the top of the hill, and black oil was bubbling in the pool. He was as happy as if he had found a treasure. He lived there with a hunting dog and a donkey, put the oil in sheepskin bags, and used the donkey to carry it to distant towns to sell to people for lighting. He lived like this for more than ten years.
    The Baiyin Factory copper mine in Gansu is even more of a famous treasure land that has been known for more than a thousand years. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, people had mined silver mines near the copper mine. Before liberation, the Kuomintang government also sent people to conduct geological surveys, but it was abandoned because it was considered to be pyrite of little value. It was not until after liberation that it was found that there was the richest copper mine in the world under the pyrite.
    Old China was like this, not recognizing treasures and not treasuring treasures. Under the rule of the reactionary rulers, the working people of our country held a golden rice bowl in their hands, but lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear. Although there were also some patriotic geologists at that time who wanted to find rich mineral resources for the country, they had no opportunity to participate in economic construction at all, nor did they have the conditions for conducting field surveys. The geological work funds were pitifully small. Until the eve of liberation, there were only 14 dilapidated drilling rigs in the entire country. At that time, the tools used by geological personnel in the field were only geological hammers, compasses, and magnifying glasses; indoors, they could only use spectroscopes and rotating stages to look at thin sections of ore at most. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, geophysical prospector Gu Gongxu obtained a British-made electrical prospecting instrument, the only one in the country, which was originally a very fortunate thing. However, just because this instrument lacked a small 1-kilowatt generator, he ran around for seven years, entrusting dozens of factories and commercial firms, but in the end, because no factory in China could manufacture it, and there was no foreign exchange to buy it from abroad, it ended in failure. This only instrument in the country, like his prospecting technology, only ended up with "no place for heroes to use their talents."

        A New Era of Geological Work
    Now, all of this has become a thing of the past. Ten years ago, the Chinese people had already stood up, and the magnificent socialist construction cause is developing by leaps and bounds at an unprecedented speed. Geological work has become the first step in national construction. Geologists are gloriously called "vanguards of industrialization." They shoulder the heavy responsibility of finding sufficient mineral resources for socialist construction.
    In order to strengthen this department, the state has transferred tens of thousands of outstanding cadres to strengthen the leadership of the geological front in the past ten years. In the past ten years, the state's geological exploration funds have been enough to build four Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factories or build 18 Chengdu-Chongqing Railways.
    Geological teams and prospecting technology have been unprecedentedly expanded and improved. The desolate and bleak scene of exploration work, which used to be described as "no one is seen in the empty mountains, only the sound of geological hammers is heard," has been swept away. Instead, what appears in our country's barren mountains and wildernesses are teams with modern equipment: aerial surveying teams, general survey and exploration teams, mining engineering teams, analysis and identification teams, petroleum geology teams, geophysical prospecting teams, and geochemical prospecting teams... The geological exploration team has increased 400 times compared with before liberation. The roar of thousands of drilling rigs shook the silent valleys, and the wilderness became the source of industry.
    Various formal geodetic surveys and scientific theoretical research work that had never been conducted in old China also began to be carried out in a planned manner in 1956 with the help of Soviet experts, and significant results have been achieved. Now, there are more than 40 geological research institutions in the country, which play a good guiding role in prospecting work.
    More importantly, geological work in New China has found a broad road to quickly, efficiently, and economically identify our country's rich resources. The mass reporting and prospecting movement of tens of thousands of people going up the mountains in the mass steelmaking campaign in 1958 not only conducted an unprecedented large-scale general survey of our country's mineral resources, and found a large number of mineral deposits for local industries that flourished everywhere, but also made geological work jump out of the narrow circle of relying only on a few experts in the past. Now, a strong geological exploration network has spread all over the country. In this exploration network, there are not only well-trained professional geological teams, but also geological teams established in the special zone and county last year, as well as mass mineral reporting activists who are familiar with the local mountain terrain and have certain prospecting knowledge. They work together and march towards nature with the heroic spirit of "declaring war on the earth and asking for treasures from the deep mountains," prompting geological work to better meet the needs of the country's leap-forward development.

                Making Contributions to the Motherland
    Today, when we celebrate the achievements of the great motherland's ten years of construction and sing praises of the harvest of underground resources, please do not forget the 300,000 geological pioneers who are all over our country's barren mountains and wildernesses. Among them are gray-haired old geological experts, long-tested revolutionary fighters, young workers who have only recently come out of factories, mines, rural areas, and trenches, and young technicians who have just left school. In the past ten years, this young geological vanguard has climbed mountains and crossed mountains, braved wind and rain, and used tenacious will and selfless labor to overcome the heat and cold in the Gobi Desert, overcome the difficulties of water shortage and low air pressure, and overcome the complex and changeable strata, making immortal contributions to the motherland.
    Young Communist Party member Yang Deyu, in order to find out the secrets of Jingtieshan, once walked alone with four sesame seed cakes and a gun in the uninhabited mountains for six days. On the afternoon of the third day, he was walking on the mountainside when it suddenly rained heavily. The rocks under his feet were as slippery as if they had been oiled. He accidentally fell from the mountainside and lost everything, even the sesame seed cakes. At this time, the mountain was too slippery to climb up, and the rushing river water was ahead. He once thought about going back, but when he thought of the party's encouragement when he left and the spirit of overcoming difficulties during the Red Army's Long March, he took off his pants and continued to move forward in the river. When he was hungry, he drank a few mouthfuls of cold water and finally completed the surveying task. Yu Chongxiu, a female geological staff member in Anhui Province, once carried a roll of geological maps and crossed the river alone in a small wooden basin. When she reached the center of the river, the basin leaked and sank, and the water was about to submerge her head, but what she thought of was not her own life, but she raised the geological map, the result of the entire team's labor, and shouted: "Map! Map! Map!"
    Such selfless deeds are not just one or two in the exploration life of geological personnel. At the People's Congress, at various labor model and advanced producer representative conferences, or at activist conferences held by the youth and women's circles, we can often see these respectable and lovely pioneers who are full of dust and come from various exploration sites. It is they who, in just ten years, have added mineral deposit points like stars in the summer night to our original blank mineral resource map, and have done many things that predecessors dared not and could not do.
    The Qinling Mountains, which were described by the poet Li Bai as "even the yellow crane can't fly over, and the gibbons want to cross but worry about climbing," have now been treaded out by them in hundreds of routes, and dozens of minerals such as copper, iron, lead, zinc, nickel, and molybdenum have been found. The Qaidam Basin, where only gazelles and wild wolves used to haunt, is now a paradise for young exploration team members. They have given it many beautiful pronouns—"unparalleled wealth," "treasure bowl," "oil sea"... The countless treasures they have found here have turned this desolate Gobi Desert into a reserve base for our country's petroleum industry, chemical industry, and metallurgical industry.
    In the past ten years, the places explored by geological pioneers have added up to be larger than five Frances; in the past ten years, the drilling footage of geological pioneers into the strata, if added up, is equivalent to twice the diameter of the earth. ...
    Writing here, I am reminded of a song by exploration team members:
    "The ancient dense forest,
    The steep wild ridges and barren hills,
    I want to insert into your heart,
    Dig out the sleeping treasure,
    Let the flowers of industry bloom everywhere,
    Build the motherland into a paradise on earth."
    Congratulations to you, vigorous pioneers, your ideal is being realized. (Attached picture)

    我们有无尽的宝藏
    本报记者　罗漩
    在我们伟大祖国的九百六十万平方公里国土上，不论是皑皑白雪的高山顶，还是密茂广阔的森林，一望无际的草原，变幻莫测的沙漠，到处都有勘探队员的足迹。是他们，把沉睡千年的荒山一个个唤醒；是他们，让大自然丰富的矿产资源为祖国的工业化服务。
      捷报！捷报！
    想想看，就在新中国成立以后的短短十年内，从那些渺无人烟的荒山野岭，从那些开山探宝的人那里，已经传来了多少振奋人心的捷报！
    弓长岭、大冶铁山，白云鄂博铁矿矿区范围的不断扩大，已经能够建设鞍钢、武钢、包钢三大工业梁柱了，然而接着又在镜铁山、攀枝花、鄂西、当涂、莱芜、岚县、石碌……发现了一百多个铁矿。
    1955年发现克拉玛依的消息刚刚传出，人们为“中国贫油论”的彻底破产而兴奋的心情还未平息，柴达木盆地成排的储油构造又不断喷出原油，面积占四川全省三分之一的川中盆地，1958年也变成了巨大的油区。连那东北的松辽平原和长江中下游地区，也找到了储油构造，被地质学家认为是有含油希望的地区了。
    单是一个箇旧锡矿，就比世界著名的产锡国——马来亚的全国锡矿储量还大，现在广东、广西、湖南，以至浙江的二千公里地带和西北、东北等地，又找到了同样的大锡矿产地。连反动资产阶级学者断言我国缺乏的铜，这十年来也找到了三千多个新矿点，其中东川、易门等十多个大矿，每个矿的储量，都比解放前估计的全国储量还要多。
    作为工业粮食的煤，勘探收获更为丰富。现在，我们不仅已有华北和东北两个蔓延几千公里的巨大含煤区，还在西北、西南、华中，甚至过去认为不可能有煤的长江以南各省，也发现了丰富的新煤田。现在估算，全国煤田远景储量可供我国开采一万年以上。
    从前，有一个英国人收藏到一把1080毫米长的石棉，便认为是世界上最长的石棉，放在一个精致的玻璃柜里，上面写着“稀世之珍”几个字。后来，这把石棉陈列在大英博物馆里，这个人也得了“石棉大王”的名称。但是，这样的石棉我国并不稀罕。1958年四川石棉县找到的一个大石棉矿，不仅储量大，矿床集中，可以露天开采，而且纤维长度有一千五百到一千八百毫米。
    十年来，我们发现了成千上万个新矿点；十年来，我们勘探的矿产已有八十八种，而旧中国三十多年只勘探了十八种。经过十年的勘探，我们已从过去资源不清、储量极少一跃为世界上矿产资源储量极丰富的国家。钨、锡、钼、锑的探明储量已位于世界最前列，预计到今年年底，探明的可供工业设计的铁矿将达一百一十四亿吨，煤的探明储量将达一千零六十亿吨，可供建设年产一百万吨煤的矿井一千对。其他像铅、锌、硫、磷、锰、铝等矿产，探明储量也都已名列世界各国前茅。即使过去认为比较缺乏的钾、铬、镍、硼以及发展尖端工业用的稀有金属，现在也已找到不少丰富的矿产地。所有这些，为我国社会主义建设提供了足够的矿产资源。
          有宝不当宝的时代
    我们勤劳而勇敢的祖先，是有过丰富的找矿经验的。远在二千六百多年前，他们就在四川发现了天然气，并创造了简单的钻机，“凿井为泉，汲取滷水”。春秋时管子一书中也记载，当时已有“出铜之山四百六十七，出铁之山三千六百有九”。可见那时我国的采矿工业已相当发达了。到秦始皇时（公元前二百多年），有人又在南昌附近发现了煤矿，而在所谓现代文明的欧洲，直到十三世纪还不知道煤能燃烧。1275年以后来我国游历的意大利人马可孛罗，在他所写的游记中还说：“中国人烧黑色的石头。”
    然而，我们祖先这种丰富的找矿知识，在近百年来一直没有得到发扬光大，西洋近代地质科学在清同治年间传入我国后，也没有得到重视和发展。帝国主义者为了达到掠夺中国的目的，一面派遣一些反动学者来觊觎我国丰富的矿产资源，一面又捏造“中国是资源贫乏的国家”等等谬论，企图扼杀幼小的中国现代工业。
    那时候，无数的宝藏被窒息在地下，无数矿山只能成为野兽和风暴逞凶的地方。而一些早已被劳动人民所发现，并在民间到处流传着的宝山、宝洞，也没有引起当时统治者的注意。
    内蒙古草原上的人们早就把白云鄂博当做一座神奇的宝山，那里流传过一个神话般的故事：七百年前，成吉思汗乘马来到这里，刚刚登上那座矗立在草原上的大山山腰，他的那匹骁健的马就停住走不动了。成吉思汗拉住缰绳用双腿使劲夹着马肚，那马还是寸步难行。当时草原上的人们便把这座山看作宝山，把他们的英雄们的尸骨都埋葬在这里，每年还要举行盛大的祭祀。1917年，地质学家丁道衡随一个科学考察团路过这里时发现了这座宝山，估计矿石储量约一亿吨。可是国民党反动政府竟把这个发现骂为胡说，并毫无根据地把储量改为二千万吨。
    在克拉玛依也有过这样一个故事：新疆和平解放前十多年，有个维吾尔族的老猎人追逐野兽来到现在石油城的附近，发现广阔无垠的大戈壁上耸立一个十多丈高的奇怪的小山，山顶上有个油池，池里扑哧扑哧地冒着黑油。他像得了宝贝一样地欣喜，带了一条猎狗和一条毛驴住在那里，把油盛在羊皮口袋里，一次一次地用毛驴驮到远方城镇去卖给人家点灯照明。就这样过了十几年。
    甘肃白银厂铜矿更是一千多年前就已出名的宝地了。唐、宋时，就有人在铜矿附近开过银矿。解放前国民党政府也曾派人去作过地质调查，却被认为是没有多大价值的黄铁矿而放弃了。直到解放以后，才查明原来在黄铁矿下面，还有着世界上最富的铜矿。
    旧中国，就是这样有宝不识宝，有宝不当宝。在反动统治者的统治下，我国劳动人民手里捧着金饭碗，却过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活。虽然当时也有些爱国的地质学家，想为国家找出丰富的矿产资源。但是他们根本没有参加经济建设的机会，也没有进行实地勘察的条件。地质事业经费少得非常可怜，直到解放前夕，全国总共只不过十四部破烂钻机。那时，地质人员在野外使用的工具，只有钉锤、罗盘、放大镜；在室内，最多也只能用分光镜和旋转台来看看矿石薄片。抗战前，地球物理探矿学家顾功叙得到了一架英国制造的全国唯一的电测探矿仪，这原是非常幸运的事。可是就因为这架仪器缺少一部一瓩的小小发电机，他整整奔走了七年，委托了几十家工厂和商行，最后还是因为国内没有一家工厂会制造，到外国去买又没有外汇而毫无结果告终。这架全国唯一的仪器，也和他的探矿技术一样，只落得“英雄无用武之地”。
        地质工作的新纪元
    而现在，这一切都已成为历史的陈迹了，十年前，中国人民已经站立起来了，规模壮阔的社会主义建设事业正以空前的速度飞跃发展，地质工作已成为国家建设的先行步骤。而地质工作者，更是光荣地被称为“工业化的尖兵”。他们肩负重任，必须为社会主义建设寻找足够的矿产资源。
    为了加强这个部门，十年来，国家抽调了成千上万名优秀干部，加强地质战线的领导；十年来，国家拨出的地质勘探经费，足够建设四个长春第一汽车厂，或修筑十八条成渝铁路。
    地质队伍和探矿技术空前扩大和提高了。过去被人形容为“空山不见人，但闻钉锤声”的勘探工作的寂寞凄凉景象已一扫而光，代之而出现在我国荒山原野上的，是一支支拥有现代化装备的航空测量队、普查勘探队，探矿工程队，化验鉴定队，石油地质队，地球物理探矿队，地球化学探矿队……地质勘探队伍比解放以前增长了四百倍。几千部钻机的轰鸣声震荡着寂静的山谷，荒野成了工业的开源地。
    旧中国从来没有进行过的各种正规的大地测量和科学理论研究工作，也在1956年开始在苏联专家帮助下有计划地展开，而且已经取得显著成果。现在，全国已有四十多所地质研究机构，它们对找矿工作起着良好的指导作用。
    更重要的是，新中国的地质工作已找到了一条多快好省地探清我国富饶资源的广阔道路。1958年在全民大炼钢铁中出现的成千上万人上山的群众性的报矿找矿运动，不但对我国的矿产资源进行了一次史无前例的最大规模的普查，为遍地开花的地方工业找到了大量矿产地，还使地质工作从历来只靠少数专家的狭小圈子中跳了出来。现在，一个强大的地质勘探网已经撒遍全国。在这个勘探网里，不但有素有训练的专业地质队，也有去年才成立的专区、县的地质队，以及熟悉当地山势地形又具备一定找矿知识的群众报矿积极分子。他们协同动作，以“向地球开战，向深山索宝”的豪迈气概向大自然进军，促使地质工作更能满足国家建设飞跃发展的需要。
                为祖国立功
    今天，当我们欢庆伟大祖国十年建设成就，歌唱地下资源丰收的时候，请不要忘记遍布我国荒山原野上的三十多万地质尖兵。他们中，有白发苍苍的老地质专家；有久经考验的革命战士；有不久前才从工厂、矿山、农村、战壕中出来的青年工人；也有刚离开学校的年轻的技术人员。十年来，这支年轻的地质尖兵爬山越岭、栉风沐雨，用顽强的意志和忘我的劳动，战胜了大戈壁上的酷热和严寒，战胜了缺水和低气压的困难，战胜了复杂多变的地层，为祖国立下了不朽的功勋。
    青年共产党员阳德裕，为了探明镜铁山的秘密，曾一个人背着四个烙饼和一支枪在没有人迹的崇山峻岭中整整走了六天。第三天下午，他正走在山腰里，突然下起倾盆大雨，脚下的岩石像擦了油一样的滑，一不小心，他从半山腰摔了下来，把所有的东西都丢了，连烙饼也没有了，这时，山上滑得攀不上去，向前走又是湍急的河水。他曾经想到返回去，可是一想到临走时党的鼓励，红军长征时克服困难的精神，于是便脱了裤子在河水中继续前进，饿时便喝几口冷水，终于完成了踏勘任务。安徽省女地质人员余崇秀，有一次带了一卷地质图一个人坐小木盆过河，到河心时盆漏下沉，水快没了她的头顶，可是她想到的不是自己的生命，反而高举着全小队的劳动成果——地质图，高叫：“图！图！图！”
    像这样忘我的事迹，在地质人员的勘探生活中又何只一个两个。在人民代表大会上，各种劳模、先进生产者代表会议上，或是青年、妇女界召开的积极分子会议上，我们经常可以看到这些风尘仆仆、来自各个勘探工地的可敬可爱的尖兵。就是他们，在短短十年内，使我们原来犹如白纸般的矿产资源图上，添上了像夏夜繁星般的矿点，做出了许多前人不敢也不可能做的事。
    被诗人李白形容为“黄鹤之飞尚不过，猨猱欲渡愁攀援”的秦岭，现在已被他们踏出了几百条路线，找到了铜、铁、铅、锌、镍、钼等几十种矿藏。原来只有黄羊和野狼出没的柴达木盆地，今天更是青年勘探队员的乐园。他们为它起了很多美丽的代名词——“盖世豪富”、“聚宝盆”、“油海”……。他们在这里找到的无数宝藏，已使这个渺无人烟的大戈壁变成我国石油工业、化学工业、冶金工业的后备基地。
    十年来，地质尖兵们踏勘过的地方，加起来比五个法国还要大；十年来，地质尖兵们打入地层的钻探进尺，如果加起来相当于地球直径的两倍。…………
    写到这里，使我想起勘探队员的一首歌：
    “古老的密茂森林，
    陡峻的野岭荒岗，
    我要插进你的心脏，
    掘出沉睡的宝藏，
    让工业之花遍地开放，
    把祖国建设成人间天堂。”
    祝贺你，矫健的尖兵，你的理想正在实现。（附图片）
