The Brilliant Achievements of Medical Science in New China
Huang Jiasi, President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences

Before liberation, China's health conditions were extremely backward, and various diseases caused exceptionally heavy damage to the people. There was an extreme shortage of health cadres. Only a few large cities had medical institutions, and the broad masses of working people had no access to medical treatment. Although there were a relatively large number of doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, they were discriminated against and could not develop.

After liberation, thanks to the concern of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for the health of the people, health undertakings have developed rapidly. Under the guidance of the four major principles of "serving workers, peasants and soldiers," "prevention first," "unity of Chinese and Western medicine," and "combining health work with mass movements," preventing and controlling diseases that most seriously endanger people's health and increasing the people's health level have become the central tasks of all medical workers. The patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases, not only eradicated disease vectors and improved environmental sanitation, but also established good hygiene habits among the broad masses of the people, changed the country's health outlook, and promoted industrial and agricultural production. In order to ensure that sick people receive timely treatment, labor insurance medical care for workers and staff in national industrial and mining enterprises has been implemented since 1951, and free medical care or reduced medical fees have been implemented in ethnic minority areas. Since 1952, public medical care has been implemented for staff members of state organs. The development of these health undertakings requires more health cadres and higher levels of medical prevention technology. In terms of cadre training, over the past ten years, the number of graduates from higher medical colleges has reached more than 40,000, more than four times the number of graduates in the twenty years before liberation (1927-1947), and the number of graduates from secondary medical and health schools has reached more than 150,000, more than three times the total number of graduates before liberation. In terms of improving technical levels, medical colleges and many medical prevention institutions have successively and rapidly launched research work. In 1957, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences was established, with ten research institutes under it, including experimental medicine, drugs, antibiotics, labor hygiene and labor protection and occupational diseases, epidemiology and microbiology, parasitic diseases, and blood transfusion and hematology. It includes basic medicine, clinical medicine, preventive medicine, and pharmacy, and gradually forms a national medical science research center. Since 1958, many regions across the country have successively established local academies of medical sciences to lead medical science research in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, which has given a new look to China's medical science. The main aspects are briefly described below:

Eliminating and Controlling Major Diseases

Parasitic diseases are diseases that seriously endanger the health of the Chinese people. Schistosomiasis used to be prevalent in 324 counties and cities in twelve provinces of China, threatening the health of approximately 100 million people and causing great damage to agricultural production. In the prevention of schistosomiasis, we have extensively investigated the prevalence of schistosomiasis and mastered the modes of infection in different types of areas; systematically studied the life habits of Oncomelania snails (the intermediate host of schistosomiasis) and effective methods for killing them; and mastered various methods for treating feces and eliminating schistosomiasis eggs in feces. In the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, the warm water incubation method and the sodium hydroxide direct incubation method were created to check feces, which improved the diagnostic rate; intradermal tests with schistosomiasis adult worm antigen and liver egg antigen had a positive rate as high as 95%-99%; serological tests of schistosomiasis patients using schistosomiasis cercarial membrane reaction and circumoval precipitin test had positive rates of over 95%. In the treatment of schistosomiasis, the three-day short-course therapy with potassium antimony tartrate (originally required twenty days) was created, greatly increasing the speed of treatment. In 1958 alone, 3.17 million people were treated. According to the observation of 643,285 treated cases, the long-term efficacy reached over 80%, and the mortality rate was only 0.005%. For early acute patients, adrenocorticotropic hormone was used to reduce toxic blood symptoms; for late-stage patients, a comprehensive treatment combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine was adopted. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment can make ascites disappear, increase appetite, and improve general condition, preparing conditions for antimony treatment. In the past two years, nearly 100,000 patients have been treated with a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and 90% of them have improved. For malaria, we have studied the problem of eradicating malaria by using 15 mg of domestic Primaquine daily for 14 consecutive days, combined with 0.3 grams of chloroquine daily for the first four days. No recurrence was observed for eight months. For Kala-azar, the efficacy of using China's self-made sodium stibogluconate reached 97.4%.

In terms of viral diseases, China has isolated the measles virus and is testing inactivated vaccines. The quality of placenta globulin made in China is good, and the content of gamma globulin reaches more than 80% of the total protein. Injecting it into susceptible children at a dose of 40 mg per kilogram of body weight can prevent infection. In the study of Japanese encephalitis, many strains of the virus have been isolated in various places, and it has been found that vector mosquitoes are also long-term hosts of the disease. Encephalitis virus has been isolated from overwintering adult Culex mosquitoes and adult mosquitoes hatched from their eggs. This discovery is of great significance in the epidemiology and prevention of encephalitis. Acupuncture treatment of poliomyelitis and its sequelae has achieved significant results. Now, electromyography is used to observe the efficacy of acupuncture more meticulously and objectively. Using chicken embryo inoculation, we isolated eleven strains of trachoma virus, and trachoma virus antigen reacted positively with the serum of most trachoma patients.

In addition to viral diseases, in terms of acute infectious diseases, the mortality rate of dysentery has been greatly reduced, decreasing by 89.5% in 1958 compared to 1950, but the incidence rate is still high. Chinese scholars have improved Shigella-Salmonella culture medium and have made dry culture medium, which greatly improves the detection rate. Among dysentery patients in China, Shigella infection has been greatly reduced, Sonne's bacillus is increasing, and Flexner's bacillus still accounts for the majority, about 70%. We have observed a toxic type of bacterial dysentery in children, which has a very rapid onset, indistinct dysentery symptoms, and often results in death within 24 hours. Autopsy revealed significant edema of the brain and brainstem, as well as atrophy of the adrenal cortex. This observation is of great significance for elucidating the nature of toxic dysentery and guiding treatment. Chinese pediatricians use therapeutic hypothermia, blockade, hormone therapy, combined with the use of traditional Chinese medicine and antibiotics, to control high fever, convulsions, and shock, which has reduced the mortality rate from 25% to 4.2%.

Chinese scholars have done a lot of work on the prevention and research of tuberculosis. By the end of 1958, a total of 10,059,000 children had been vaccinated with BCG nationwide. In order to prolong the effectiveness of BCG, China has made freeze-dried BCG vaccine, which has a stable number of live bacteria after being refrigerated for one to two years. Intradermal vaccination with vaccine stored for twelve months resulted in a conversion rate of 89.7%. In terms of drug treatment of pulmonary cavities, since 1952, many units have used local therapy of dripping anti-tuberculosis drugs into the trachea, and the cavity closure rate is very high. In recent years, some units have further inserted catheters into the cavity to drip drugs more directly, and the effect is better. Lung resection for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis has been carried out in various parts of China. According to incomplete statistics, in the past ten years, a total of 6,116 lung resections have been performed for pulmonary tuberculosis, the surgical mortality rate is very low, about 1%, and among the 4,826 cases followed up for more than one year, 80%-90% of the patients have fully recovered and resumed work. For bone and joint tuberculosis, aggressive focus removal is often adopted. According to an analysis of 1,400 cases, the cure rates of hip joint and spinal tuberculosis were 95.3% and 86.1%, respectively, and the average cure periods were 7.5 months and 8.9 months, respectively. Compared with the plaster fixation therapy commonly used in the past, the effect of focus removal is obviously superior. For renal tuberculosis, Chinese scholars pointed out that bladder tuberculosis often causes stenosis of the ureteral orifice on the healthy side and bladder contracture, thereby causing hydronephrosis on the healthy side. According to a study of 1,498 cases of renal tuberculosis, the incidence of hydronephrosis on the healthy side was 16.0%. This observation is important, and ignoring this point will misdiagnose some unilateral renal tuberculosis as bilateral renal tuberculosis, causing patients to lose the opportunity for surgical treatment. The prevention and control of tuberculosis in the ten years since liberation has been successful. In the surveyed areas, the incidence of tuberculosis has dropped from 1.5% in the early days of liberation to below 1%, and the decrease in mortality rate is even more significant. Taking Beijing as an example, it was 230/100,000 population in 1949 and 46/100,000 population in 1958.

Hypertension is one of the common diseases in China. According to a survey of 127,000 adults in urban and rural areas in Shanghai, the total morbidity rate was 6.95%, among which the morbidity rate of employees with more intensive mental activity was higher, such as telegraph and telephone workers and car drivers, the morbidity rate was 11.3%, while that of suburban farmers was 2.2%. According to the analysis of Hunan, Shanghai, Wuhan and other places, most of the patients with hypertension died of cerebrovascular accidents, about 65%-70%, while about 16% died of heart failure and about 4% died of myocardial infarction, which is significantly different from the situation abroad. Among the Chinese herbal medicines produced in China, there are many that have considerable efficacy against hypertension, among which Rauwolfia has a more significant effect and is currently being studied in depth. Atherosclerosis in China not only has a lower incidence rate, accounting for about 7% of cardiovascular diseases, but also is milder and occurs later in life, fifteen to twenty years later compared with foreign countries. Regarding cardiac and great vessel surgery, surgical treatment of various congenital and acquired heart diseases has been carried out in various places. Commissurotomy for mitral stenosis has been carried out successively in major hospitals across the country since 1954. According to the statistics of 1,108 cases in several units, the surgical mortality rate was 1.8%. Now direct vision surgery for mitral insufficiency and aortic stenosis has been carried out. For patent ductus arteriosus, many units can perform ligation and division surgery, and Chinese scholars have also created a new method of suturing at both ends of the catheter first and then cutting it. For tetralogy of Fallot, various decompression surgeries, such as subclavian artery-pulmonary artery anastomosis, aorta-pulmonary artery anastomosis, and superior vena cava-pulmonary artery anastomosis have been applied in China. In April 1958, surgery for direct vision repair of atrial septal defects under hypothermic anesthesia began in China, and in June of the same year, direct vision surgery for ventricular septal defects using extracorporeal circulation began, both of which were successful. Some units perform ventricular septal defect surgery under hypothermic anesthesia without extracorporeal circulation, and the effect is also very good. Resection of aortic aneurysms and resection of aortic stenosis followed by allograft or plastic artificial blood vessel transplantation have been successful, and China has been able to make its own plastic blood vessels.

In terms of tumor research, according to pathological analysis of more than 100,000 tumors, malignant tumors in China have certain characteristics. For example, primary liver cancer is more common in China. According to an autopsy statistics, deaths from liver cancer accounted for 11.9% of the total number of deaths from malignant tumors, while prostate cancer is quite rare. For example, in a group of 28,884 malignant tumors, there were only sixteen cases of prostate cancer. Some tumors have a more obvious geographical distribution in China, such as esophageal cancer, which is more common in the north, while nasopharyngeal carcinoma is more common in the south. The reason why liver cancer is more common seems to be related to cirrhosis and Clonorchis sinensis infection. Cirrhosis can cause hepatocellular carcinoma, and Clonorchis sinensis infection can lead to cholangiocarcinoma. In terms of tumor treatment, Chinese scholars have accumulated a lot of experience and achieved good results. According to an analysis of 1,562 cases of esophageal cancer in eighteen units, the average mortality rate of esophagectomy was 10%. In recent years, the surgical mortality rate has dropped to 3% in specialized hospitals and some medical colleges. Among the 750 cases of radical surgery for cervical cancer, there were no surgical deaths. Among the 1,464 cases of intracranial tumors, 67% of meningiomas and 34% of neurinomas can be completely resected. Extensive liver resection for the treatment of liver cancer, pancreaticoduodenectomy for the treatment of pancreatic head cancer, and pelvic exenteration for the treatment of pelvic cancer have been carried out in many areas.

In order to eliminate and control these diseases, China has carried out a lot of research work in drugs, antibiotics and biological products. In the search for new drugs, the work of screening anti-schistosomiasis drugs is the most prominent. More than 400 kinds of compounds have been synthesized and tested, and it has been found that trivalent antimony ammonium gluconate, antimony sodium dimercaptosuccinate, quinine antimony complex salt hydrochloride, p-aminophenoxyheptane, rosaniline, traditional Chinese medicine pumpkin seeds and daylily have significant killing effects on schistosomiasis in animal infections. Chinese scientists have created the experience of producing cortisone from diosgenin without progesterone. In terms of antibiotics, we have created the replacement of corn syrup with gluten in corn steep liquor, which increased the penicillin fermentation titer to 5,000 units per milliliter, doubling the industrial production of penicillin. Chinese scientists have also found a kind of actinomycin K, which has a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of some experimental tumors. In terms of biological products, the output in 1958 was twelve times that of 1950. These are all favorable weapons for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Implement the policy of prevention first in scientific research work

In the past ten years, in order to cooperate with the national socialist construction, a series of studies have been carried out to improve the working conditions of employees and eliminate major occupational diseases.

In terms of the prevention and treatment of silicosis, silicosis surveys have been conducted in many important factories and mines, and the incidence of the disease among workers in various industries and types of work has been basically clarified. Due to the adoption of various dust prevention measures, by the end of 1958, the dust concentration in major factories and mines across the country did not exceed the national standard of 2 mg/cubic meter, effectively controlling the harm of silicosis to workers.

In terms of eliminating heatstroke, in the past few years, through sanitary surveys of high-temperature workshops, cooling measures and reasonable dietary supplies have been adopted, and the incidence of heatstroke among workers has been rapidly reduced. For example, the incidence of heatstroke among workers in high-temperature workshops in Beijing in 1958 decreased by 98% compared with 1955.

In terms of the prevention and treatment of occupational poisoning, in the past ten years, surveys of lead poisoning have been conducted on more than 10,000 people, clarifying the sanitary conditions and the incidence of poisoning in different industries and types of work, and preventive and control measures have been taken. Now the incidence of lead poisoning has been significantly reduced. For example, the incidence of lead poisoning in Boshan Battery Factory in 1958 was only 12.5% of that in 1955. The incidence of benzene poisoning is higher in industries such as paint making, painting, 666 manufacturing, spraying, and shoe making. Thanks to the measures taken, the benzene concentration in the air in 108 spraying workshops in Shanghai was reduced to below the health standard of 0.05 mm/liter in a very short time.

In terms of the prevention and treatment of industrial injuries, due to the strict implementation of labor protection and safety regulations, industrial injuries have been greatly reduced. Medical personnel going deep into workshops and construction sites has become a system, and injured workers can receive good initial treatment before going to the hospital, which greatly improves the treatment effect. Some injuries have certain characteristics in China. For example, in coal miners, meniscus injury of the knee joint is more common on the lateral side than on the medial side in China, while it is more common on the medial side abroad. In the treatment of burns, China has achieved excellent results. Among the 103 injured people with a burn area of 30%-50% of the whole body, the cure rate was 91.3%, the cure rate was 63.5% among the 32 cases with an area of 50%-70%, the cure rate was 57.1% among the 42 cases with an area of 70%-90%, and even among the 21 cases with an area of 90%-100%, there were still three cases cured. Chinese surgeons have gained a lot of experience in rescuing burn patients. We have learned that in anti-shock treatment, the amount of blood and fluid transfusion must be determined based on strict clinical observation and laboratory tests, and cannot be calculated solely based on formulas. Hypothermic drugs have good effects when used with caution. In terms of wound treatment, some traditional Chinese medicines have good effects on drying wounds and preventing infection. Early skin grafting is the fundamental method to prevent infection and sepsis. For third-degree burns, we advocate early eschar excision and skin grafting. After allografting, if the skin is torn off and autografted without waiting for the skin to melt and fall off, the survival rate of skin grafting can be increased. When there is Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, phage wet dressing should be applied before skin grafting, and the exposure method should be adopted after skin grafting, and the success rate of skin grafting can be improved.

Combining Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine to Explore the Treasure House of Traditional Medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are the accumulation of experience in fighting diseases in China for thousands of years. The Party called on Western medicine to learn from traditional Chinese medicine, combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and use modern scientific methods to sort out and promote traditional medicine. With the close cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, we have observed that traditional Chinese medicine has significant effects on many diseases. For example, acute appendicitis treated with traditional Chinese medicine has a cure rate of 94.7% in 666 cases, and 5.3% require surgical treatment; in 835 cases treated with acupuncture, 91.5% were cured. Preliminary observations have shown that traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture have the best curative effect for simple acute appendicitis, the effect is worse for chronic appendicitis, and the effect is not good when there is fecal stone formation obstruction, which requires surgical treatment. The dry hemorrhoid therapy for internal hemorrhoids, that is, applying dry hemorrhoid powder containing arsenic and alum on the hemorrhoid surface, or inserting the dry hemorrhoid powder into the hemorrhoid in the form of a needle, can make the internal hemorrhoid dry and fall off, and then the wound heals. The thread-hanging therapy for anal fistula, that is, passing a medicated thread through the fistula, and then tying the two ends of the thread, can cut open the fistula, and the wound gradually heals. These methods can enable some patients to avoid surgical treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine has a better curative effect in terms of reducing swelling in the treatment of chronic nephritis. In a group of 663 cases of chronic nephritis, after treatment with traditional Chinese medicine, the edema was completely subsided or significantly reduced in 65.1%, and the urine protein was completely converted to negative or significantly reduced in 20.1%. For ascites caused by cirrhosis, there are also more cases where ascites subsides after treatment with traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture therapy is widely used and has a high curative effect on many diseases, such as pain, inflammation, and acquired deafness and muteness. Qigong therapy is effective for many chronic diseases, such as peptic ulcer and hypertension. Traditional Chinese massage can relieve muscle spasm, adjust the disorder of nerve reflexes, and strengthen blood circulation for acute lumbar and cervical sprains, thereby quickly reducing swelling and relieving pain. These therapies have been used for a long time in traditional Chinese medicine and have been closely observed by Western medicine in recent years.

Due to the cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, improved methods have been proposed for the treatment of certain diseases. For example, in the thread-hanging therapy for anal fistula, many now use elastic rubber bands instead of medicated threads, which cuts open the fistula faster. Ultraviolet irradiation of acupuncture points to treat bronchial asthma can be used without acupuncture. The No. 10 hemostatic powder created by Tianjin Blood Transfusion and Hematology Research Institute contains traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and the hemostatic effect is higher than using traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine alone.

On the basis of affirming the curative effect, we are further studying the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Meridian theory is an important basis for traditional Chinese medicine to explain human physiology, pathology, and to diagnose and treat diseases. In order to observe the relationship between meridians and various internal organs, we have conducted animal experiments. After injecting the isotope P32, acupuncture at acupoints on different meridians found that the distribution of isotopes in various organs was different. Adrenaline was used to slow down the heart rate in animals. Acupuncture at acupoints on the heart meridian can accelerate the recovery of the heart rate, while acupuncture at acupoints on other meridians is ineffective. Observing the effect of acupuncture on normal people and appendicitis patients, acupuncture at the appendicitis acupoint increases the peristalsis of the appendix, while acupuncture at other acupoints does not have this phenomenon. Regarding the effect of Qigong therapy, we found that the amplitude of brain waves increased and the muscle chronaxie was prolonged during Qigong practice, indicating that the cerebral cortex was in an inhibited state during Qigong practice. After applying Qigong therapy, a series of changes occurred inside the body, the amplitude of diaphragmatic movement increased, and the permeability of capillaries increased. These studies are only preliminary and need to be continued in depth.

In terms of drugs, we are cultivating and identifying medicinal plants, screening traditional Chinese medicines for anti-tumor, anti-hypertension, and anti-radiation, and studying the pharmacological effects and dosage forms of traditional Chinese medicines, and have achieved certain results.

Future Efforts

In the past ten years, China's medical science research work has done a lot of work for the prevention and treatment of diseases, improving people's health level and ensuring national production and construction. However, due to the weak scientific foundation in China in the past, in order to make China's health work meet the needs of socialist construction, our medical scientists must make the greatest efforts in the following aspects.

1.  Continue to strengthen the health team, train a large number of cadres, and appropriately train specialized talents in various fields. China has a large population. Although the number of graduates from higher medical colleges in the ten years since liberation has far exceeded the number trained in the 69 years before liberation, it is still far from enough. In the future, we must train more and faster to serve the working people in vast areas. At the same time, in order to improve the level of medical science in China, we must also train a group of higher quality specialized talents to engage in teaching and scientific research work. This is the policy of combining popularization and improvement in cadre training.

2.  Continue to improve the quality of medical prevention work and strive to study basic theoretical issues. In China, many parasitic diseases and infectious diseases have not been eliminated, and some infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, seem to be increasing. Some diseases still lack early diagnosis and effective treatment methods. The mortality rate of some surgical operations is still high. We must improve the quality of medical prevention work to further improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality rate. On the other hand, we must engage in the research of some basic theories in medicine, such as the normal physiology of the human body and the physiological changes under the invasion of various diseases, and the laws of occurrence and development of normal tissues and tumor tissues. Tumor immunity, bacterial variation, etc. must be studied in order to better fight diseases. To solve these basic theoretical problems, it is necessary to vigorously develop basic medical disciplines such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, pathology, microbiology, and immunology. It is necessary to solve the problems in practical work and study the basic theoretical problems of medicine. This is the policy of closely combining theory with practice in research work.

3.  Continue to learn and carry forward traditional Chinese medicine and march towards cutting-edge science and technology. The significant effects of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and massage on many diseases have been briefly described in the article. There are many more traditional Chinese medicine therapies that we have not yet mastered. We must learn from traditional Chinese medicine so that we can master more methods to better serve patients. On the other hand, today's scientific development is changing rapidly, and many new achievements in physics and chemistry, such as isotopes and ultrasonic waves, can be used as diagnostic and treatment tools. The Soviet Union has great achievements in this area, and other countries also have many things we can learn from. We must learn from them and master these new technologies. It is necessary to carry forward traditional Chinese medicine and march towards cutting-edge science. This is the policy of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the direction of medical development in China.

On the basis of the achievements already made, medical workers across the country will continue to exert their energy, strive for the top, and will certainly make China's health work leap forward even greater, better, and more comprehensively.

    新中国医学科学的辉煌成就
    中国医学科学院院长　黄家驷
    解放前，我国卫生状况极其落后，各种疾病对人民的侵袭危害异常惨重。卫生干部极其缺乏。只有少数大城市具有医疗机构，广大劳动人民没有就医的机会。中医虽人数较多，但受到歧视，不能发展。
    解放后，由于中国共产党和人民政府对人民健康的关怀，卫生事业有了迅速的发展。在“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”和“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”四大方针的指导下，防治危害人民健康最严重的疾病和增进人民健康水平，已成为全体医务工作者的中心任务。以除四害、讲卫生、消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动不仅扑灭了疾病媒介，改善了环境卫生，而且在广大人民中建立了良好的卫生习惯，改变了国家的卫生面貌，促进了工农业的生产。为了使有病的人得到及时的治疗，自1951年起，实行了全国工矿企业职工劳动保险医疗，对少数民族地区，实行了减免费医疗。1952年起，对国家机关工作人员实行了公费医疗。这些卫生事业的发展，就要求有更多的卫生干部和更高的医疗预防技术水平。在干部培养方面，十年来，高等医药院校毕业生达四万余人，为解放前二十年（1927—1947年）毕业生数的四倍多，中等医药卫生学校毕业生十五万余人，为解放前毕业生总数的三倍多。在技术水平提高方面，各医学院校和不少的医疗预防机构均先后迅速开展研究工作。1957年建立了中国医学科学院，下设实验医学、药物、抗菌素、劳动卫生劳动保护及职业病、流行病与微生物学、寄生虫病、输血与血液学等十个研究所。包括了基础医学、临床医学、预防医学和药学各个部门，逐步形成全国医学科学研究中心，1958年起全国不少地区先后成立了地方的医学科学院，领导省市和自治区的医学科学研究，这就使我国医学科学出现了新面貌。兹略述其主要方面：
    消灭和控制主要疾病
    寄生虫病是严重危害我国人民健康的疾病。血吸虫病曾在我国的十二个省三百二十四县、市中流行，威胁着约一亿人口的健康，对农业生产的损害甚大。在血吸虫病的预防方面，我们广泛调查了血吸虫病的流行情况，掌握了不同类型地区的感染方式；系统研究了钉螺（血吸虫的中间宿主）的生活习性和其有效杀灭方法；掌握了多样的粪便处理和在粪便中消灭血吸虫卵的方法。在血吸虫病的诊断方面，创造了温水孵化和氢氧化钠直接孵化法以检查粪便，提高了诊断率；以血吸虫成虫抗原及肝卵抗原作皮内试验，阳性率高达95％—99％；用血吸虫尾蚴膜反应和环卵沉淀反应两种特异性血清反应方法检查血吸虫病患者，阳性率均在95％以上。在血吸虫病的治疗方面，创造了用酒石酸锑钾三天短程疗法（原需二十天），大大地提高了治疗速度。在1958年的一年内就治疗了三百一十七万人。根据所治疗的六十四万三千二百八十五例的观察，远期疗效达80％以上，死亡率仅为0.005％。对早期急性患者，使用了促肾上腺皮质激素，可以减轻毒血症状；对晚期患者，采取了中西医结合的综合疗法。中医治疗可使腹水消失，食欲增加，一般情况好转，为锑剂治疗准备条件。近两年来中西医合治了近十万名患者，其中90％已好转。对于疟疾，我们研究了根治疟疾的问题，以国产伯氨喹啉每日十五毫克，连服十四天，前四天每日合用氯喹啉零点三克，观察八个月无复发者。对于黑热病，用我国自制的葡萄糖酸锑钠，疗效达97.4％。
    在病毒性疾病方面，我国已分离出麻疹病毒，并试制灭活菌苗。我国自制的胎盘球蛋白质量良好，丙种球蛋白的含量达总蛋白量的80％以上，用以对易感儿童注射，每公斤体重的注射量为四十毫克，可以防止其感染。在乙型脑炎的研究方面，各地已分离出多株病毒，并发现媒介蚊虫也是本病的长期宿主，从越冬后的库蚊成蚊及其卵孵化出的成蚊，均分离出脑炎病毒。这个发现在脑炎的流行病学及其防治工作上均有重要意义。使用针灸治疗脊髓灰白质炎及其后遗症获得显著的疗效，现在用肌电图的方法更细致地、更客观地观察针灸的疗效。利用鸡胚接种，我们分离出砂眼病毒十一株，砂眼病毒抗原与大多数砂眼病人的血清起阳性反应。
    除病毒性疾病外，在急性传染病方面，痢疾的病死率已大为降低，1958年比1950年降了89.5％，但发病率仍高。我国学者改进了志贺氏沙门氏培养基，并已制成干燥培养基，大大地提高了检出率。在我国痢疾患者中，志贺氏菌感染已大为减少，宋氏菌正在增加，而弗氏菌仍占多数，约为70％。我们在儿童中观察到一种中毒型细菌痢疾，起病很急，痢疾症状不明显，多于二十四小时内死亡。在尸检中发现脑部及脑干均有显著水肿，同时肾上腺皮质萎缩。这种观察对于阐明中毒型痢疾的性质和指导治疗均有重要作用。我国儿科工作者采用冬眠、封闭、激素等疗法，结合中医中药及抗菌素的使用，以控制高热、惊厥和休克，已使病死率自25％降低到4.2％。
    对于结核病的防治和研究，我国学者做得比较多。全国接种卡介苗的儿童到1958年底已达一千零五十九万人次。为了延长卡介苗的效期，我国制成冻干卡介苗，冷藏一到二年后活菌数稳定，用保存十二个月后的疫苗作皮内接种，阳转率达89.7％。在肺空洞的药物治疗上，1952年起，不少单位用经气管滴入抗结核药物的局部疗法，空洞闭合率很高。近年来，有的单位进一步地将导管插入空洞以便更直接地滴入药物，效果更好。用肺切除术治疗肺结核已在我国各地展开。根据不完全的统计，十年来，因肺结核而施行的肺切除术共六千一百一十六例，手术死亡率很低，约为1％，经一年以上随诊的四千八百二十六例中，80％—90％病人全愈并恢复工作。对于骨关节结核，多采取积极的病灶清除术，据一千四百例的分析，髋关节和脊椎结核的治愈率分别为95.3％和86.1％，平均治愈期分别为7·5月和8·9月。与过去常用的石膏固定疗法比较，病灶清除术的效果显然较为优越。对于肾结核，我国学者指出膀胱结核常引起健侧输尿管口狭窄和膀胱挛缩，因而引起健侧肾积水，根据一千四百九十八例肾结核的研究，健侧肾积水的发病数为16.0％。这一观察是重要的，忽视了这一点就会把一部分单侧肾结核误诊为双侧肾结核，使病人失去了手术治疗的机会。解放后十年来的结核病防治工作是有成绩的。在所调查的地区，结核病的发病率已由解放初期的1.5％降到1％以下，而死亡率的下降更为显著，以北京市为例，1949年为230／100000人口，1958年为46／100000人口。
    高血压病是我国多发病之一。根据上海市在城乡十二万七千余成年人中的调查，总患病率为6.95％，其中脑力活动较紧张的职工发病率较高，如电报、电话职工和汽车司机的患病率为11.3％，而郊区农民为2.2％。据湖南、上海、武汉等地的分析，高血压病患者死于脑血管意外者最多，约65％—70％，而死于心力衰竭者约16％，死于心肌梗死者约4％，这和国外的情况有显著的不同。我国生产的植物药中，有多种对高血压有相当高的疗效，其中以萝芙木的疗效较为显著，现正深入研究。动脉粥样硬化在我国不仅发病率较低，约占心血管病的7％，而且程度较轻，年龄较晚，与国外比较要晚发十五到二十年。关于心脏和大血管外科，各种先天性和后天性心脏病的外科治疗在各地先后展开。用交界分离术治疗二尖瓣狭窄自1954年开始以来，全国各大医院均已相继进行。据几个单位一千一百零八例的统计，手术死亡率为1.8％。现在二尖瓣闭锁不全和主动脉瓣狭窄的直视手术均已开展。对于动脉导管未闭，不少单位均能施行结扎和切断的手术，而且我国学者还创用了先在导管两端缝合然后切断的新方法。对于法洛氏四联症，各种减压手术，如锁骨下动脉肺动脉吻合术，主动脉肺动脉吻合术和上腔静脉肺动脉吻合术均已在我国应用。1958年4月在我国开始了在低温麻醉下直视修补心房间隔缺损的手术，同年6月开始了利用体外循环进行心室间隔缺损的直视手术，均获成功。有的单位不用体外循环在低温麻醉下进行心室间隔缺损的手术，效果也很好。在主动脉瘤切除和主动脉狭窄切除后作异体血管或塑料人工血管移植均告成功，而且我国已能自制塑料血管。
    在肿瘤的研究方面，根据十万以上的肿瘤病理分析，我国恶性肿瘤有一定的特点。例如原发性肝癌在我国较为多见，据一组尸检统计，死于肝癌的占恶性肿瘤病死者总数的11.9％，而前列腺癌则颇为少见，如在一组二万八千八百八十四例恶性肿瘤中，前列腺癌仅有十六例。有些肿瘤在我国有较明显的地理分布，如食管癌较常见于北方，而鼻咽癌较常见于南方。肝癌多见的原因，似与肝硬化和中华分枝睪吸虫感染有关。肝硬化可引起肝细胞癌，中华分枝睪吸虫感染可继发胆管上皮癌。在肿瘤治疗上，我国学者已累积了不少经验，并获得了较好的效果。根据十八个单位一千五百六十二例食管癌的分析，食管切除的平均死亡率为10％，近年来在专科医院和一些医学院，手术死亡率已降至3％。子宫颈癌的根治手术七百五十例中无一例手术死亡。颅内肿瘤一千四百六十四例中，67％的脑膜瘤和34％的神经瘤能全部切除。以肝脏广泛切除术治疗肝癌，以胰十二指肠切除治疗胰头癌，以盆腔脏器清扫术治疗盆器癌肿均在不少地区进行。
    为了消灭和控制这些疾病，我国在药物、抗菌素和生物制品方面都进行了不少研究工作。在寻找新药方面，以筛选抗血吸虫病药物的工作最为突出，已合成和试验了各种化合物四百多种，发现三价葡萄糖酸锑铵、二氢基丁二酸锑钠、盐酸奎宁锑复盐、对氨苯氧庚烷、玫瑰苯胺、中药南瓜子和野金针菜对于动物感染的血吸虫都有显著的杀灭作用。我国科学工作者创造了不经过黄体酮从薯蓣皂元制成皮质酮的经验。在抗菌素方面，我们创造了玉米浸液中麸质代替玉米浆，提高了青霉素发酵效价到每毫升五千单位，使青霉素的工业生产量增高了一倍。我国科学工作者还找到了一种放射菌素K，对有些实验性肿瘤的生长有显著的抑制作用。在生物制品方面，1958年的产量为1950年的十二倍。这些都是防治疾病的有利武器。科学研究工作中贯彻预防为主的方针
    十年来，为了配合国家社会主义建设，对改善职工劳动条件和消灭主要职业病进行了一系列的研究。
    在防治矽肺方面，对许多较重要的厂矿进行了矽肺调查，基本上摸清了各行业、各工种工人的发病情况。由于采取了各种防尘措施，到1958年底全国较大厂矿粉尘浓度已不超过国家规定的二毫克／立方米的标准，有效地控制了矽肺对工人的危害。
    在消灭中暑方面，几年来通过对高温车间的卫生调查，采取了降温措施和合理饮食供应，工人的中暑发生率已迅速降低，如北京市高温车间工人1958年的中暑发生率比1955年减少了98％。
    在防治职业中毒方面，十年来对铅中毒调查了万人以上，摸清了不同行业、工种的卫生情况和中毒发病率，并采取了防治措施。现在铅中毒的发病率已显著降低，如博山—蓄电池厂铅中毒发病率1958年仅为1955年的12.5％。苯中毒的发病率以造漆、油漆、666制造、喷漆、制鞋等行业为较高。由于采取了措施，上海一百零八个喷漆车间在很短时间内，使空气中苯浓度降到卫生标准0.05毫米／升以下。
    在工伤事故的防治方面，由于严格执行劳动保护和安全规程，工伤事故已大为减少。医务人员深入车间和工地已成为制度，受伤工人都能在未到医院之前获得良好的初步处理，大大提高了治疗效果。有些损伤在我国有一定的特点，例如煤矿工人中的膝关节半月板损伤在我国外侧多于内侧，而在国外以内侧为多。在烧伤的治疗上，我国取得了优异的成绩。在一百零三例烧伤面积达全身30％—50％的伤员中，治愈率为91.3％，面积50％—70％的三十二例中治愈率为63.5％，面积70％—90％的四十二例中治愈率为57.1％，甚至面积90％—100％的二十一例中仍有三例治愈。在救治烧伤病人中，我国外科医师取得了不少经验。我们体会到，在抗休克治疗中，输血输液的量必须根据严密的临床观察和化验检查来决定，而不能专凭公式来计算。冬眠药物在谨慎使用下有良好的作用。在创面的处理上，有一些中药对于干燥创面和防止感染有良好的功效。早期植皮是防止感染和败血症的根本方法。对于三度烧伤我们主张早期切除焦痂和植皮。在用异体植皮后，如果不待皮肤溶化脱落即撕去并进行自体植皮，可增加植皮的成活率。有绿浓杆菌感染时，植皮前应用噬菌体湿敷，植皮后采用暴露法，植皮成功率可以提高。
    中西医结合发掘祖国医学宝藏
    中医中药是我国数千年来和疾病作斗争的经验累积。党号召西医学习中医，中西医结合，以现代科学方法整理和发扬祖国医学。在中西医密切合作下，我们已观察到中医中药对许多疾病有显著的疗效。例如急性阑尾炎用中药治疗，在六百六十六例中有94.7％治愈，5.3％需要手术治疗；用针灸治疗的八百三十五例中有91.5％治愈。初步观察到中药和针灸对单纯的急性阑尾炎疗效最好，慢性阑尾炎效果较差，而在有粪石形成梗阻的效果不佳，需要手术治疗。内痔的枯痔疗法，即用含砒和矾的枯痔散涂于痔面，或将枯痔散制成针状插入痔内，可使内痔干枯脱落，然后创面愈合。肛瘘的挂线疗法，即将药线穿过瘘管，然后将线两端结扎，可以切开瘘管，创口逐渐愈合。这些方法都可使一部分病人不须手术治疗。中医治疗慢性肾炎在消肿方面有较好的疗效。在一组六百六十三例的慢性肾炎中，经中医治疗后浮肿完全消退或显著减轻的占65.1％，尿蛋白完全转为阴性或显著减轻的占20.1％。对于因肝硬化而发生的腹水，中医治疗后腹水消退的病例也比较多。针灸疗法应用极为广泛，对许多疾病疗效很高，如对疼痛、炎症和后天性聋哑等都有肯定的疗效。气功疗法对许多慢性疾病，如溃疡病、高血压症都有疗效。中医的推拿法对于急性腰部和颈部扭伤，可以缓解肌肉痉挛，调整神经反射的紊乱，加强血液循环，从而迅速消肿止痛。这些疗法都是中医应用已久，近年来由西医加以周密观察的。
    由于中西医合作，在某些疾病的治疗上提出了改进的方法，例如治疗肛瘘的挂线疗法，现在很多用富有弹力性的橡皮筋代替药线，切开瘘管较快。用紫外线照射治疗支气管哮喘的穴道可以不用针刺。天津输血与血液病研究所创用的十号止血散含有中药和西药，止血功效比单用中药或单用西药均高。
    在肯定疗效的基础上，我们正在进一步地研究中医的理论。经络学说是中医用以说明人体生理、病理和用以诊断、治疗疾病的重要依据。为了观察经络与各内脏器官的关系，我们曾作动物实验，在注射同位素P32后，针刺不同经络的穴道，发现同位素在各脏器的分布有所不同。在动物身上用肾上腺素引起心率变慢，针刺心经的穴道可加快心率的恢复，而针刺其他经络的穴道则无效。在正常人和阑尾炎病人观察针刺作用，针刺阑尾穴时阑尾蠕动增加，而针刺其他穴道则无此现象。关于气功疗法的作用，我们发现练功时脑?波幅度增强，肌肉时值延长，说明练功时大脑皮层处于抑制状态。应用气功疗法后，身体内部出现一系列的变化，膈肌活动幅度增大，毛细血管通透性增高。这些研究仅是初步的，还须继续深入。
    在药物方面，我们正在作植物药的栽培与鉴定，抗肿瘤、抗高血压病、抗放射病等中药的筛选以及中药药理作用和剂型的研究，都取得一定的效果。
    今后的努力方向
    十年来我国医学科学研究工作对于防治疾病，提高人民健康水平和保证国家生产建设做了不少工作。但由于我国过去科学基础薄弱，要使我国卫生工作满足社会主义建设事业中的需要，我们医学科学工作者还必须在以下几方面作最大的努力。
    一、继续壮大卫生队伍，大量培养干部，并适当地培养各项专科人材。我国人口众多，虽在解放后十年来，高等医学院校的毕业生已远超过解放前六十九年所培养的人数，但还是远远不够的。今后必须更多更快地培养，为广大地区的劳动人民服务，同时为了提高我国医学科学水平，又必须培养一部分质量更高的专科人才，从事于教学和科学研究工作，这是在干部培养上的普及和提高相结合的方针。
    二、继续提高医疗预防工作质量，并努力钻研基本理论问题。在我国，不少的寄生虫病和传染病尚未消灭，有的传染病，如脊髓灰白质炎似有增加的趋势。有的疾病尚缺乏早期诊断和有效治疗的方法。有的外科手术，死亡率仍高。我们必须提高医疗预防工作质量，以进一步提高治愈率和减低死亡率。另一方面我们必须从事于医学中一些基本理论的研究，如人体的正常生理和在各种疾病侵害下的生理变化，正常组织和瘤组织的发生发展规律。肿瘤免疫问题，细菌变异规律问题，均须加以研究，才能使我们更好地和疾病作斗争。要解决这些基本理论问题，就必须大力发展解剖学、生理学、生物化学、生物物理学、病理学、微生物学、免疫学等基础医学学科。既要解决实际工作中的问题又要研究医学的基本理论问题，这是在研究工作中理论密切结合实际的方针。
    三、继续学习和发扬祖国医学，并向尖端科学技术进军。中医中药针灸推拿对许多疾病有显著疗效已在文中简略述及。还有更多的中医疗法，我们还没有掌握。我们必须向中医学习，使能掌握更多方法，以便更好地为病人服务。另一方面，现今科学发展日新月异，许多物理、化学上的新成就，如同位素、超声波等均可用以作为诊断和治疗的工具。苏联在这方面有伟大的成就，其他国家也有不少可资我们学习的地方。我们必须向他们学习，掌握这些新技术。既要发扬祖国医学，又要向尖端科学进军，这是我国医学发展方向上中西结合的方针。
    全国医学工作者在已有成就的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定能使我国卫生工作更大更好更全面地跃进。
