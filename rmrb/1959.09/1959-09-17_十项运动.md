Sports Knowledge:

    Decathlon is one of the main competition events in men's track and field. It has been listed as an international competition event since 1912. Because athletes must participate in ten competitions including running, jumping, and throwing, it is also called the decathlon. It can exercise people's all-round physical development.
    The decathlon is held over two days. On the first day, athletes must participate in five events in succession: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, and 400 meters. On the second day, they must participate in another five events in succession: 110-meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 meters. The score of each event is converted into a certain number of points (the better the score, the more points), and the sum of the scores of the ten events is the athlete's final score. Currently, the world record for the decathlon has reached 8357 points, created by Soviet athlete Kuznetsov on May 16th and 17th this year. Kuznetsov was the first athlete in May of last year to exceed the 8,000-point "mark" in the decathlon, breaking the long-standing American dominance in this sport.
    The decathlon started relatively late in New China, but when the first decathlon competition was held at the National Track and Field and Cycling Games in October 1956, Shandong athlete Hao Jianren broke Zhang Lingjia's pre-liberation national record of 4348 points, which had been held for 23 years, with a score of 5135 points. In 1958, Beijing athlete Yu Xinlu improved the national record to 5185 points.
    Since the beginning of this year, the decathlon has developed rapidly. So far, six athletes have broken the national record held by Yu Xinlu, with the best score being Qi Dechang from Shanghai (5696 points). A total of 39 athletes are participating in the first National Games decathlon competition, and fierce competition is expected. In addition to Qi Dechang, Yu Xinlu's best score this year reached 5431 points, Jia Deliang from Shandong 5268 points, Lin Zhonghe from Jiangsu 5256 points, and Zhou Zhenxing from Anhui 5229 points. Who will win depends on who can persist in fully demonstrating the level of all ten events within two days.

    十项运动
    十项运动是男子田径运动中的主要竞赛项目之一，从1912年开始就已被列为国际的竞赛项目。由于运动员必须参加十个包括跑、跳和投掷项目的竞赛，因而它也叫十项全能运动。它可以锻炼人们身体的全面发展。
    十项运动分两天举行。运动员必须在第一天先后参加完一百米、跳远、铅球、跳高和四百米五个项目的竞赛。第二天再先后参加完另五个项目——一百一十米高栏、铁饼、撑竿跳高、标枪、一千五百米的竞赛。每个项目的成绩都折合成一定的分数（成绩越好分数越多），十个项目得分的总和就是运动员的最后成绩。目前，十项运动的世界纪录已达到八三五七分，是苏联运动员库兹涅佐夫今年5月16和17两日创造的。库兹涅佐夫是去年5月间第一个成为世界上十项运动成绩超过八千分“大关”，并且打断了美国长久以来在这项运动方面所占的优势的运动员。
    新中国十项运动开始开展的时间较晚，但1956年10月间在全国田径、自行车运动会上第一次举行十项运动比赛时，山东选手郝健仁就以五一三五分的成绩，打破了张龄佳保持了二十三年之久的四三四八分的解放前的全国纪录。1958年，北京选手于新潞又把这项全国纪录提高到五一八五分。
    今年以来，十项运动发展很快，到目前为止已有六名选手打破了于新潞保持的全国纪录，其中成绩最好的是上海的齐德昌（五六九六分）。这次参加第一届全国运动会十项运动比赛的选手共有三十九人之多，预料争夺将会十分激烈。选手中除齐德昌外，于新潞今年的最好成绩曾达到五四三一分，山东贾德良五二六八分，江苏林仲和五二五六分，安徽周振兴五二二九分。谁将获得优胜，那要看谁能在两天内坚持使十个项目的水平都能充分地表现出来。
