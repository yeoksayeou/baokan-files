    Provide More Electricity for Continuing the Great Leap Forward
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, a vigorous and magnificent production upsurge has taken shape throughout the country. As the "vanguard," the power industry bears an extremely important task in ensuring the overfulfillment of this year's production plan.
    We know that electricity is of great importance in our lives. Electricity is inextricably linked to modern industry; it can even be said that without electricity, there would be no achievements of modern industry. Every industrial product has a certain power consumption quota. A powerful electric current drives the operation of machines, and the production of all modern industries begins here. In order to ensure the completion of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, the power industry must give full play to its role as the "vanguard."
    The development of the national economy requires a sufficient supply of electricity; the growth of the power industry must also rely on the development of the entire national economy. The development of the national economy, especially the development of the iron and steel industry, the machinery industry, and the coal industry, can provide the power industry with more equipment and fuel. The power industry and other industrial sectors have a relationship of mutual interaction and mutual promotion. Precisely because of this, in recent years, with the rapid development of China's economic construction, especially the Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1958, the power industry has also been advancing rapidly. In 1958, China's power generation reached 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 42.5% over 1957, which is about 4.6 times the power generation in the highest year in old China. The newly added power generation equipment capacity in one year last year was 1,797,000 kilowatts (excluding small power stations run by urban and rural people), which is 2.4 times the newly added power generation equipment capacity in 1957, and is about three-quarters of the total new equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period; equivalent to the total power generation equipment capacity left by the old Chinese power industry that has developed for more than 60 years. The tremendous leap forward in the power industry eloquently proves that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people can quickly build China into a highly industrialized and electrified socialist power, and at the same time powerfully proves the complete correctness of the Party's General Line, the mass movement, and a whole set of two-legged walking policies.
    This year, China's power industry continues to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. From January to August, the country generated a total of 25.1 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 51% over the same period last year, approaching the total power generation last year; from January to August, the newly added power generation equipment capacity totaled 700,000 kilowatts, an increase of 18% over the same period last year. At present, there are 184 projects under construction across the country, and it is estimated that about 2.3 million kilowatts of new power generation equipment capacity can be added by the end of the year. The newly added power generation equipment capacity this year is equivalent to more than 90% of the newly added power generation equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period, which is 500,000 kilowatts more than in 1958. According to the national economic plan adjusted by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the power industry's power generation plan this year is 39 billion kilowatt-hours. This plan represents an increase of 42% over the power generation in 1958, which is twice as fast as the average annual growth rate of 21.6% during the First Five-Year Plan period. After completing or overfulfilling this plan, this year's power production will approach or even reach the level of the original power generation target of the Second Five-Year Plan. Obviously, this is a tremendous leap forward.
    Can we complete and overfulfill this leap forward plan? The hundreds of thousands of heroic sons and daughters on the power industry front answered this question loudly with the achievements they have obtained in their combat actions after the publication of the Communiqu√© and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In late August, the national average daily power generation increased by 5.5% compared with mid-August; in the first ten days of September, it increased by 7.2% compared with the average daily power generation in August. Many power plants, such as Shijingshan, Fuxin, Daye, Huainan, and Beipiao power plants, completed their August power generation plans three to four days ahead of schedule. A vigorous socialist competition has been launched on the power industry capital construction front, and many units have completed their August plans ahead of schedule, and are determined to greatly shorten the original construction period. The installation project of the first 100,000-kilowatt large-scale unit of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, with the efforts of all employees, is guaranteed to be completed and generate electricity half a month ahead of schedule before the National Day; the boiler project of the Xiaguan Power Plant, originally planned to be put into production at the end of this year, the employees guarantee to complete it in October ahead of schedule. The builders fighting at the construction sites of hydropower stations such as Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, and Xin'anjiang have all put forward guarantees to shorten the construction period. The ambition of all the employees in the power industry shows that the Party's great call has become a huge material force. We believe that as long as we continue to exert our efforts, it is entirely possible to complete this year's power industry plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.
    Now, there are only more than three months left before the end of the year, and the peak period of power supply has arrived. In these three months, the tasks of power production and capital construction are still very heavy. However, there are many favorable conditions for completing the task: First, we have the valuable experience of the Great Leap Forward last year; second, the enthusiasm of the masses is great; in terms of material conditions, most of the factory buildings for capital construction projects have been built, and most of the main engines and main furnaces are complete, and some special varieties of supporting equipment can also be solved completely with effort. The key lies in thoroughly overcoming right-leaning emotions, unswervingly carrying out mass movements, and deepening the movement to increase production and practice economy. In June of this year, a few cadres in the power industry sector had right-leaning slackening emotions due to the temporary easing of power supply and the temporary difficulty in solving certain equipment and materials. As a result, there were many accidents in production and capital construction, and the power generation plan and the project plan were not completed well. When the right-leaning thoughts were criticized and efforts were exerted, a vigorous upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy quickly formed, and the power generation increased sharply day by day and ten days by ten days; some projects that were considered impossible to complete this year have also proposed to complete them ahead of schedule at the end of this year. These facts fully prove that as long as we resolutely oppose right-leaning, exert our efforts, and rely closely on the masses, and hold high the red flag of increasing production and practicing economy, it is entirely possible to successfully complete the glorious task of this year's power industry plan.
    In order to complete this year's power industry plan and ensure the power needs of the national economy, in terms of power industry production, we must also take all measures to ensure safe power generation and safe power supply. In the vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the country, do not affect the progress of production and construction due to power outages. At the same time, we must try every means to tap the potential of equipment and generate and supply as much electricity as possible. Last year, the power industry employees created many effective advanced experiences in the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, and these experiences should continue to be vigorously promoted. In addition, we must also strive to reduce various technical and economic indicators, especially to reduce coal consumption, and try every means to save coal, burn inferior coal, and save good coal. The Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy put forward special requirements for the power industry to save coal. The specific coal saving targets set by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electricity for various power industry units must be worked hard to complete. As for various industrial and mining enterprises, they should proceed from the overall interests, assist the power industry departments in doing a good job in power distribution and adjusting load to save electricity, save every kilowatt-hour of electricity that can be saved, and enable it to play its due role in production and construction. In terms of capital construction of the power industry, we must concentrate our efforts, ensure key points, and complete this year's task of installing units and the supporting transmission and transformation projects on schedule and ahead of schedule; for important projects that will generate electricity in the first half of next year, we should also strive to do more work this year. Completing this year's capital construction task is of great importance to ensuring power consumption for key industries. Therefore, in capital construction, we must emphasize the unified allocation of supporting and important materials, require mutual cooperation, mutual exchange of information, and mutual support, and at the same time emphasize self-reliance, tap potential, and solve the shortage of certain supporting and materials from all aspects. For the progress of the project, we must conduct inspections on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis, go deep and meticulously, and discover problems and solve them quickly. We must grasp the progress, but also grasp the quality, grasp the safety, and also grasp the saving of raw materials. If we do these tasks well and comprehensively complete this year's construction task, we will have a reliable guarantee. While building large and medium-sized power stations in various places, we must also mobilize the masses to build some small power stations in accordance with local conditions to meet the power consumption needs of local industries. In particular, in some power-deficient areas, we must carry out mass electricity saving and power station building movements on a large scale. Last year, cities such as Dalian and Shenyang in Northeast China created many advanced experiences in relying on the masses and building power stations themselves to solve the problem of insufficient power supply, and these should be seriously promoted.
    We believe that the hundreds of thousands of heroic sons and daughters on the national power industry front, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, will surely successfully complete and overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks, and provide more electricity for national economic construction.
