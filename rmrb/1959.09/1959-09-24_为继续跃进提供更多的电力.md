    Provide More Electricity for Continuing the Great Leap Forward
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued the great call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, a vigorous and magnificent production upsurge has taken shape throughout the country. As the "vanguard," the power industry bears an extremely important task in ensuring the overfulfillment of this year's production plan.
    We know that electricity is of great importance in our lives. Electricity is inextricably linked to modern industry; it can even be said that without electricity, there would be no achievements of modern industry. Every industrial product has a certain power consumption quota. A powerful electric current drives the operation of machines, and the production of all modern industries begins here. In order to ensure the completion of the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, the power industry must give full play to its role as the "vanguard."
    The development of the national economy requires a sufficient supply of electricity; the growth of the power industry must also rely on the development of the entire national economy. The development of the national economy, especially the development of the iron and steel industry, the machinery industry, and the coal industry, can provide the power industry with more equipment and fuel. The power industry and other industrial sectors have a relationship of mutual interaction and mutual promotion. Precisely because of this, in recent years, with the rapid development of China's economic construction, especially the Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1958, the power industry has also been advancing rapidly. In 1958, China's power generation reached 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 42.5% over 1957, which is about 4.6 times the power generation in the highest year in old China. The newly added power generation equipment capacity in one year last year was 1,797,000 kilowatts (excluding small power stations run by urban and rural people), which is 2.4 times the newly added power generation equipment capacity in 1957, and is about three-quarters of the total new equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period; equivalent to the total power generation equipment capacity left by the old Chinese power industry that has developed for more than 60 years. The tremendous leap forward in the power industry eloquently proves that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people can quickly build China into a highly industrialized and electrified socialist power, and at the same time powerfully proves the complete correctness of the Party's General Line, the mass movement, and a whole set of two-legged walking policies.
    This year, China's power industry continues to leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. From January to August, the country generated a total of 25.1 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 51% over the same period last year, approaching the total power generation last year; from January to August, the newly added power generation equipment capacity totaled 700,000 kilowatts, an increase of 18% over the same period last year. At present, there are 184 projects under construction across the country, and it is estimated that about 2.3 million kilowatts of new power generation equipment capacity can be added by the end of the year. The newly added power generation equipment capacity this year is equivalent to more than 90% of the newly added power generation equipment capacity during the First Five-Year Plan period, which is 500,000 kilowatts more than in 1958. According to the national economic plan adjusted by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the power industry's power generation plan this year is 39 billion kilowatt-hours. This plan represents an increase of 42% over the power generation in 1958, which is twice as fast as the average annual growth rate of 21.6% during the First Five-Year Plan period. After completing or overfulfilling this plan, this year's power production will approach or even reach the level of the original power generation target of the Second Five-Year Plan. Obviously, this is a tremendous leap forward.
    Can we complete and overfulfill this leap forward plan? The hundreds of thousands of heroic sons and daughters on the power industry front answered this question loudly with the achievements they have obtained in their combat actions after the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In late August, the national average daily power generation increased by 5.5% compared with mid-August; in the first ten days of September, it increased by 7.2% compared with the average daily power generation in August. Many power plants, such as Shijingshan, Fuxin, Daye, Huainan, and Beipiao power plants, completed their August power generation plans three to four days ahead of schedule. A vigorous socialist competition has been launched on the power industry capital construction front, and many units have completed their August plans ahead of schedule, and are determined to greatly shorten the original construction period. The installation project of the first 100,000-kilowatt large-scale unit of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, with the efforts of all employees, is guaranteed to be completed and generate electricity half a month ahead of schedule before the National Day; the boiler project of the Xiaguan Power Plant, originally planned to be put into production at the end of this year, the employees guarantee to complete it in October ahead of schedule. The builders fighting at the construction sites of hydropower stations such as Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, and Xin'anjiang have all put forward guarantees to shorten the construction period. The ambition of all the employees in the power industry shows that the Party's great call has become a huge material force. We believe that as long as we continue to exert our efforts, it is entirely possible to complete this year's power industry plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.
    Now, there are only more than three months left before the end of the year, and the peak period of power supply has arrived. In these three months, the tasks of power production and capital construction are still very heavy. However, there are many favorable conditions for completing the task: First, we have the valuable experience of the Great Leap Forward last year; second, the enthusiasm of the masses is great; in terms of material conditions, most of the factory buildings for capital construction projects have been built, and most of the main engines and main furnaces are complete, and some special varieties of supporting equipment can also be solved completely with effort. The key lies in thoroughly overcoming right-leaning emotions, unswervingly carrying out mass movements, and deepening the movement to increase production and practice economy. In June of this year, a few cadres in the power industry sector had right-leaning slackening emotions due to the temporary easing of power supply and the temporary difficulty in solving certain equipment and materials. As a result, there were many accidents in production and capital construction, and the power generation plan and the project plan were not completed well. When the right-leaning thoughts were criticized and efforts were exerted, a vigorous upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy quickly formed, and the power generation increased sharply day by day and ten days by ten days; some projects that were considered impossible to complete this year have also proposed to complete them ahead of schedule at the end of this year. These facts fully prove that as long as we resolutely oppose right-leaning, exert our efforts, and rely closely on the masses, and hold high the red flag of increasing production and practicing economy, it is entirely possible to successfully complete the glorious task of this year's power industry plan.
    In order to complete this year's power industry plan and ensure the power needs of the national economy, in terms of power industry production, we must also take all measures to ensure safe power generation and safe power supply. In the vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the country, do not affect the progress of production and construction due to power outages. At the same time, we must try every means to tap the potential of equipment and generate and supply as much electricity as possible. Last year, the power industry employees created many effective advanced experiences in the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, and these experiences should continue to be vigorously promoted. In addition, we must also strive to reduce various technical and economic indicators, especially to reduce coal consumption, and try every means to save coal, burn inferior coal, and save good coal. The Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy put forward special requirements for the power industry to save coal. The specific coal saving targets set by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electricity for various power industry units must be worked hard to complete. As for various industrial and mining enterprises, they should proceed from the overall interests, assist the power industry departments in doing a good job in power distribution and adjusting load to save electricity, save every kilowatt-hour of electricity that can be saved, and enable it to play its due role in production and construction. In terms of capital construction of the power industry, we must concentrate our efforts, ensure key points, and complete this year's task of installing units and the supporting transmission and transformation projects on schedule and ahead of schedule; for important projects that will generate electricity in the first half of next year, we should also strive to do more work this year. Completing this year's capital construction task is of great importance to ensuring power consumption for key industries. Therefore, in capital construction, we must emphasize the unified allocation of supporting and important materials, require mutual cooperation, mutual exchange of information, and mutual support, and at the same time emphasize self-reliance, tap potential, and solve the shortage of certain supporting and materials from all aspects. For the progress of the project, we must conduct inspections on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis, go deep and meticulously, and discover problems and solve them quickly. We must grasp the progress, but also grasp the quality, grasp the safety, and also grasp the saving of raw materials. If we do these tasks well and comprehensively complete this year's construction task, we will have a reliable guarantee. While building large and medium-sized power stations in various places, we must also mobilize the masses to build some small power stations in accordance with local conditions to meet the power consumption needs of local industries. In particular, in some power-deficient areas, we must carry out mass electricity saving and power station building movements on a large scale. Last year, cities such as Dalian and Shenyang in Northeast China created many advanced experiences in relying on the masses and building power stations themselves to solve the problem of insufficient power supply, and these should be seriously promoted.
    We believe that the hundreds of thousands of heroic sons and daughters on the national power industry front, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, will surely successfully complete and overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks, and provide more electricity for national economic construction.

    为继续跃进提供更多的电力
    本报评论员
    党的八届八中全会向全党和全国人民提出了提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召以后，一个轰轰烈烈、波澜壮阔的生产高潮已在全国形成。作为“先行官”的电力工业，在保证超额完成今年生产计划中担负着极其重要的任务。
    我们知道，电在我们的生活中有着极大的重要性。电力与近代工业有着密不可分的关系，甚至可以说，没有电便没有近代工业的成就。每一种工业产品都有一定的耗电定额。强大的电流带动了机器的运转，一切近代工业的生产就从这里开始。为了保证提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，电力工业必须充分发挥“先行官”的作用。
    国民经济的发展，需要有足够的电力供应；电力工业的增长，也必须依赖于整个国民经济的发展。国民经济发展了，特别是钢铁工业、机械工业、煤炭工业发展了，才能为电力工业提供更多的设备和燃料。电力工业与其他工业部门之间，是一种互相作用、互相促进的关系。正由于此，几年来，随着我国经济建设事业的急速发展，特别是1958年国民经济的大跃进，电力工业也在急速前进。1958年，我国发电量已经达到二百七十五亿度，比1957年增加了42.5％，约等于旧中国历史上最高年份发电量的四点六倍。去年一年增加的发电设备容量是一百七十九点七万瓩（不包括城市与农村群众自办的小型电站），为1957年新增加的发电设备容量的二点四倍，约等于第一个五年计划期间全部新增设备容量的四分之三；相等于发展了六十多年的旧中国电力工业所留下的全部发电设备容量。电力工业的巨大跃进，雄辩地证明了我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，能够迅速地把我国建成一个高度工业化和电气化的社会主义强国，同时也有力地证明了党的总路线、大搞群众运动和一整套两条腿走路的方针的完全正确。
    今年，我国电力工业在1958年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。1至8月份全国共发电二百五十一亿度，比去年同期增加了51％，接近去年全年的发电量；1至8月份新增加的发电设备容量共七十万瓩，比去年同期增长18％。现在，全国有一百八十四项工程正在施工，预计到年底可以新增加发电设备容量二百三十万瓩左右。今年新增加的发电设备容量等于第一个五年计划期间新增发电设备容量的90％以上，比1958年还多五十万瓩。根据党的八届八中全会调整后的国民经济计划，电力工业今年的发电量计划是三百九十亿度。这个计划比1958年的发电量增长了42％，比第一个五年计划期间的年平均增长速度21.6％快了一倍。完成或超额完成这个计划后，今年的电力生产就接近甚至达到第二个五年计划原定的发电量的水平。显然，这是一个巨大的跃进。
    能不能完成和超额完成这个跃进计划呢？电力工业战线上的几十万英雄儿女，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议发表以后，用战斗行动所获得的成绩响亮地回答了这个问题。8月下旬，全国平均日发电量比8月中旬增加了5.5％；9月头十天又比8月份的平均日发电量增加了7.2％。许多电厂如石景山、阜新、大冶、淮南、北票等发电厂，都提前三天到四天完成了8月份的发电计划。电力工业基本建设战线上掀起了热火朝天的社会主义竞赛，许多单位都提前完成了8月份计划，并且决心把原订的工期大大缩短。北京热电站的第一台十万大型机组的安装工程，在全体职工的努力下，保证提前半个月在国庆节以前建成发电；下关电厂的锅炉工程，原计划在今年年底投入生产，职工们保证提前在10月份完成。战斗在三门峡、刘家峡、盐锅峡、新安江等水电站工地的建设者们，都纷纷提出了缩短工程期限的保证。电力工业全体职工的这种雄心壮志，说明了党的伟大号召已经成为巨大的物质力量，我们相信，只要继续鼓足干劲，提前完成和超额完成今年电力工业计划是完全可以做到的。
    现在，离年底只有三个多月的时间了，电力供应的高峰时期已经来临。在这三个多月的时间内，电力生产和基本建设的任务还都很重。但是，完成任务的有利条件是很多的：首先是有了去年大跃进的宝贵经验；其次，当前群众的干劲很大；在物质条件方面，基本建设工程的厂房大部盖起来了，主机主炉大部分齐全了，一些配套设备的特殊品种，只要经过努力也是完全可以解决的。关键在于彻底克服右倾情绪，坚定不移地大搞群众运动，把增产节约运动深入开展下去。今年6月间，电力工业部门的少数干部，曾经因为电力供应的暂时缓和以及某些设备器材的一时难以解决等，产生了右倾松劲情绪，结果在生产和基本建设工作中出现了事故多、发电计划以及工程计划完成得不好的现象。及至批判了右倾思想，鼓足了干劲，一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约高潮就迅速形成，发电量逐日逐旬地猛烈增长；过去一些被认为不能在今年完成的工程，也纷纷提出要在今年年底提前完成。这些事实充分地证明了，只要坚决反右倾、鼓干劲，紧紧依靠群众，高举增产节约的红旗，就完全可能胜利地完成今年电力工业计划的光荣任务。
    为了完成今年的电力工业计划，保证国民经济用电的需要，在电力工业生产方面，还必须采取一切措施，保证安全发电、安全供电，在举国上下轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，不要因为停电而影响生产建设的进度。同时要千方百计地挖掘设备潜力，尽量多发电、多供电。去年电力工业职工在技术革命和技术革新运动中，创造了许多行之有效的先进经验，这些经验应该继续大力推广。此外，还要努力降低各项技术经济指标，特别是降低煤耗，要千方百计地节约煤、烧劣煤、省好煤。党的八届八中全会在开展增产节约运动的决议中，对电力工业节约煤炭特别提出了要求。水利电力部向各个电业单位规定的具体的节约煤炭指标，必须努力完成。至于各个工矿企业，应该从整体利益出发，协助电业部门作好电力分配和调整负荷节约用电的工作，把可以节约的每一度电节约出来，使它在生产建设中发挥应有的作用。在电力工业的基本建设方面，要集中力量，保证重点，按期和提前完成今年的装机任务和与之相配合的输变电工程；明年上半年发电的重要工程，今年也要争取多作一些工作量。完成今年的基本建设任务，对保证重点工业的用电有极大关系。因此，在基本建设中，必须强调在配套和重要器材供应上的统一调配，要求互相协作，互通有无，互相支援，同时也要强调自力更生，挖掘潜力，从各方面解决某些配套和器材的不足。对于工程进度，要按月、按旬、按日进行检查，深入细致，发现问题，迅速解决。要抓进度，也要抓质量，要抓安全，也要抓节约原材料。作好了这些工作，全面地完成今年的建设任务，就有了可靠的保证。各地在兴建大中型电站的同时，还要发动群众，因地制宜地兴建一些小型电站，以满足地方工业的生产用电。特别是一些缺电的地区，更要大规模地开展群众性节电、办电运动。去年东北的旅大、沈阳等城市，在依靠群众、自己动手办电解决电力供应不足方面，创造了许多先进经验，应该认真推广。
    我们相信，全国电力工业战线上的几十万英雄儿女，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的八届八中全会伟大号召的鼓舞下，一定能够出色地完成和超额完成今年的生产和建设任务，为国民经济建设提供更多的电力。
