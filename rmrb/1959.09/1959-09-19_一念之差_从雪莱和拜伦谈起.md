    A Moment's Difference
    ——Starting with Shelley and Byron
    Yang Dehua
    Shelley was buried by Byron himself when he died. That was in 1822, on the coast of Casa Magli in Italy. Two years later, Byron died of illness in Missolonghi, Greece, while aiding the Greek national liberation movement. The two poets were good friends during their lives, both progressive Romantic poets in the literary world, and both were revolutionaries at the time of their deaths. However, Marx made very different evaluations when talking about these two poets. He said, "Anyone who knows and likes them believes that Byron's death at the age of thirty-six was a blessing, because if Byron had lived longer, he would have become a reactionary bourgeois; on the contrary, these people regretted Shelley's death at the age of twenty-nine, because he was a true revolutionary and always a vanguard of socialism." What is the difference between them? After re-reading their poems recently, I seem to have realized some truths.

    Whether or not one believes in the masses and considers them to be the creators of history is the watershed of a true revolutionary. The biggest difference between the two poets lies here.

    Shelley treated the masses with great enthusiasm, firmly believing that they would bury all rulers. He appealed to the British people:

    Englishmen, why do you plough for the lords who oppress you?
    Why do you make magnificent garments for the tyrants who curse you?
    Why do you groan so bitterly,
    From the first day to the last,
    To guard with groans the drones that sting?
    Have they not stung you, and drunk your sweat?
    Do you not toil to feed the slothful drones,
    Who would consume your soul with ceaseless woe?
    You sow seed, but the tyrant reaps;
    You find wealth, but the impostor keeps;
    You weave robes, but the idle wear;
    You forge arms, but the destroyer bears.
    Sow seed,—but let no tyrant reap;
    Find wealth,—let no imposter keep;
    Weave robes,—let not the idle wear;
    Forge arms,—in your defence to bear.

    Byron, on the other hand, treated the masses from a position of superiority. Although he sympathized with the people's national liberation movement, he was, at heart, a nobleman. In "Manfred," he had Manfred say to the hunter who rescued him:

    Patience, hence—that word was made for slaves!
    Heard’st thou of patience being ‘mongst the free?
    Hence with such cant! away, and to the herd
    Of peasant slaves thy sermons—and thy tears!
    I am of a high race, and such as I
    It is not fitting should be thus oppress’d.
    I hate the herd—the world—I hate all things.

    Shelley and Byron did not fail to argue about this proposition during their lifetimes. After Byron wrote "Manfred," Shelley immediately wrote the poem "Julian and Maddalo" and argued with Byron. Shelley asserted that the lofty ideal of a person and a poet should be to serve the oppressed people when they struggle with the rulers. Shelley disagreed with Byron's pessimistic mood and his antagonistic attitude towards the masses around him.

    Fortunately, Byron died early. Otherwise, his fatal weakness might have led him to a reactionary path later on.

    Today, our right-leaning opportunists also adopt a lordly attitude towards mass movements. Instead of standing in the midst of the vigorously developing mass movement and enthusiastically agitating like Shelley, they stand aloof from the movement, chattering about moving too fast, messing things up, and having endless worries. At heart, like the bourgeois revolutionaries in history, they simply do not believe in the masses. As a result, what is really worth worrying about is not the masses who are creating history with an overwhelming momentum, but the right-leaning opportunists themselves who are hindering the people's progress!

    Marx's evaluation of Byron more than a hundred years ago is worth pondering by right-leaning opportunists!

    一念之差
    ——从雪莱和拜伦谈起
    杨德华
    雪莱死的时候，是拜伦亲手把他埋葬的。那是在1822年，在意大利卡刹马格利的海边。两年后，拜伦为援助希腊民族解放运动在希腊米索隆基染上恶疾病逝。两位诗人生前是好友，在文坛上同为进步的浪漫主义诗人，死时又都不失为革命者。然而，马克思在谈到这两位诗人的时候，却作了迥然不同的评价。他说“凡是了解和喜欢他们的人，都认为拜伦在三十六岁逝世是一种幸福，因为拜伦要是活得再长一些，就会成为一个反动的资产者；相反地，这些人惋惜雪莱在二十九岁时就死了，因为他是一个真正的革命家，而且永远是社会主义的急先锋。”这其间的区别究竟在哪里？最近重翻了他们的诗篇，似乎悟出了些道理。
    是否相信群众，认为他们是历史的创造者，这是不是真正的革命家的分水岭。两位诗人最大的不同也就在这里。
    雪莱，对待群众是满腔热情，坚信他们必定会葬送一切统治者的。他向英国人民呼吁过：
    英国人，为什么你们给那些欺压你们的爵爷们拉犁？
    为什么你们替那些咒骂你们的暴君们做华丽的衣裳？
    为什么你们凄惨的呻吟着，
    从最初的一天到最后的一天，
    保护那些比雄蜂还要无耻的家伙，那些吸
    你们的汗，不是吸你们的汗，
    而是喝你们的血的人？……
    你们栽培了五谷，——别人来收获它们；
    你们找到了财富，——别人来拿走它们；
    你们织好了衣服——给谁？为的是不相干的人；
    你们铸造了武器——为的是别人的权力。
    栽培五谷吧——但是不给那些无耻的蠢才；
    寻找财富吧——不给那些无所不为的骗子；
    织制衣服吧——为的是寄生虫的死亡。
    铸造武器吧——为的是保卫你们自己。
    拜伦，对待群众则是高高在上的，虽然他也同情人民的民族解放运动，但是骨子里，却是贵族老爷式的态度。他在“曼弗雷德”里，借曼弗雷德之口向援救他的猎人说道：
    忍耐！忍耐！去吧！——这些字是为那些负重的畜生，而不是为掠食的猛禽创造的；
    把它去对那些像你这样的泥土的人说教吧，
    我并不是你那一类的人。
    如果我遇见了人们，
    我憎恨作他们中间的一个，
    我就感到自己卑微得跟他们一样，
    又变成泥土了。……
    雪莱和拜伦在世的时候，对这个命题不是没有争论的。拜伦写了“曼弗雷德”之后，紧接着雪莱就写了“朱里安和马达罗”一诗，和拜伦进行了争论。雪莱断定说，作为一个人、作为一个诗人的崇高理想，应该是在被压迫的人民和统治者作斗争的时候为他们服务。雪莱不同意拜伦的悲观情绪，不同意他对周围群众所采取的对抗态度。
    拜伦幸而是早死了。否则他的致命弱点很可能日后导致他走上反动的道路。
    今天，我们这些右倾机会主义者对待群众运动同样采取的是老爷式的态度。他们不是站在蓬蓬勃勃发展着的群众运动之中像雪莱似地满腔热情地去鼓动，而是高傲地站在运动之外，叽叽喳喳地议论走快了，搞糟了，有着无穷的忧虑。骨子里，和历史上的那些资产阶级革命家一样根本不相信群众。其结果真正值得人们忧虑的倒不是以排山倒海之势创造着历史的群众，而是那些妨碍人民前进的右倾机会主义者们自己！
    马克思一百多年前对拜伦所作的评价，很值得右倾机会主义者们深思！
