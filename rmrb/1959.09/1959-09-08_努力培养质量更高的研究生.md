Short Commentary:

    Since liberation, national institutions of higher education have achieved certain successes in cultivating graduate students. Graduated graduate students have played a certain role in teaching and scientific research in universities, and many have become the backbone of the teaching staff. Facts have proven that cultivating graduate students is also an effective way to train teachers for universities.
    Based on decades of Soviet experience and the actual situation in our country over the past few years, it is necessary to adhere to the graduate student system. Graduate students, after a period of rigorous training in learning and scientific research, will lay a systematic and solid theoretical foundation, possess a high level of scientific and technological expertise, and play a more important role in teaching and scientific research. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to enroll graduate students and to cultivate them diligently.
    How should graduate students be cultivated? Experience has proven that the work of cultivating graduate students can only be done well by adopting the method of guidance by a fixed supervisor under the collective leadership of the department and teaching and research group. The department and teaching and research group should mainly focus on reviewing and regularly checking the individual study plans of graduate students, and strengthen their leadership through these tasks, while the supervisors should regularly care about the progress of graduate students in their studies and research, provide timely guidance, and help them acquire the necessary knowledge and master correct research methods. Combining the collective leadership of the teaching and research group with the individual responsibility of the supervisor can achieve even greater results.
    In order to ensure the source and quality of graduate students, this year various universities have selected and retained a group of politically and professionally outstanding university graduates to apply for graduate studies. Doing so is very necessary. Various universities should also actively and as much as possible recommend in-service teachers with practical work experience to apply for graduate studies, which is greatly related to improving the quality of graduate students. After studying in the graduate stage, they will grow faster than graduates who have just come out of universities and can play a greater role in teaching and scientific research.
    Currently, more than seventy universities are recruiting graduate students. All units that recommend applicants for graduate studies should carefully select them to ensure the quality of enrollment. If the source of students is insufficient, it is better to have fewer than to lower the standards. All schools with the task of cultivating graduate students must select people who are politically progressive, academically specialized, and have rich experience in teaching and scientific research to serve as supervisors as early as possible, encourage them to be brave in taking responsibility, guide them carefully, and impart their true talents and practical knowledge to the new generation. We believe that teachers will overcome some of the difficulties in their work and complete the task of cultivating graduate students. Naturally, if some teachers do have tight teaching schedules and find it difficult to take care of both, the school should give appropriate consideration and arrange for them to have a certain amount of time. In addition, after the graduate students enter the school, the school should help them to set up a good personal study plan, properly arrange their professional studies, foreign language studies, scientific research, political studies, and productive labor, strengthen leadership, and regularly
        check them, and pay attention to creating experiences.
    Under the leadership of the Party, universities will surely cultivate graduate students into teaching and scientific research talents who are both red and expert, in order to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction.

    努力培养质量更高的研究生
    解放以来，全国高等学校在培养研究生工作方面已经取得了一定的成绩。已毕业的研究生在高等学校的教学和科学研究中起了一定的作用，不少人已经成为教师中的骨干力量。事实证明，培养研究生也是培养高等学校师资的一种有效办法。
    根据苏联几十年的经验和我国过去几年的实际情况，有必要坚持研究生制度。研究生经过一定时期的学习和科学研究的严格锻炼，将打下系统的坚实的理论基础，具有较高的科学技术水平，在教学和科学研究中发挥更重要的作用。所以，必须继续招收研究生，并且要认真培养好。
    怎样培养研究生呢？经验证明，要在系和教研组的集体领导下，采取由一个固定的指导教师指导的方式，才能够作好培养研究生的工作。系和教研组主要应当抓紧对研究生个人学习计划的审订和定期检查，并通过这些工作对他们加强领导，而指导教师则经常关怀研究生在学习和研究上的进展，给以及时的指导，帮助他们获得必要的知识和掌握正确的研究方法。教研组的集体领导同指导教师的个人负责结合起来，就可以收到更大的效果。
    为了保证研究生的来源和质量，今年各高等学校选留了一部分政治业务上优秀的大学毕业生报考研究生。这样做，是非常必要的。各高等学校还要积极地尽可能地保送有实际工作经验的在职教师报考研究生，这对提高研究生的质量有很大关系。他们经过研究生阶段的学习，会比刚从高等学校出来的毕业生成长得更快，在教学工作和科学研究工作中可以起更大的作用。
    现在，七十多所高等学校正在招考研究生。凡保送报考研究生的各单位，都要认真选拔，以保证招生的质量。如果学生来源不足，宁缺毋滥。凡有培养研究生任务的学校，一定要及早选择政治上进步、学术上有专长、教学工作和科学研究工作有丰富经验的人来作指导教师，鼓励他们勇于负责，认真指导，把自己的真才实学，传授给新的一代。我们相信，教师一定会克服工作中的一些困难，完成培养研究生的任务。自然，有些教师确有教学任务紧、较难兼顾的情况，学校就要适当照顾，安排给他们一定的时间。此外，学校在研究生进校后，要帮助他们订好个人学习计划，妥善安排他们的专业学习、外国语学习、科学研究、政治学习和生产劳动，加强领导，经常
        检查，并注意创造经验。
    在党的领导下，高等学校一定会把研究生培养成为又红又专的教学和科学研究人材，以适应社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的需要。短评
