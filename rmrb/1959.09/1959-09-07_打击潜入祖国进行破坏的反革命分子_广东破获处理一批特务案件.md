Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 4th: Guangdong Province's public security organs recently uncovered a batch of espionage cases and arrested eleven spies, including Yao Xin, Chen Zuran, Zhu Hanguang, and Bai Jinzhen, in accordance with the law.

The spies Yao Xin, Chen Zuran, He Gen, Liang Man, and Chen Yinlian were all pawns of the Chiang gang's "Intelligence Bureau." Following instructions from the spy agency, they infiltrated Guangzhou in June, carrying hand grenades and pistols, intending to carry out assassinations and explosions, and other sabotage activities. The spy Yao Xin was a rogue soldier before liberation. In 1955, he joined the Taiwan Kuomintang "Central Committee Second Group" spy organization and was appointed leader of the "Labor Movement Group." In July of last year, he joined the "Intelligence Bureau" spy organization. The spy Chen Zuran was a reactionary landlord who participated in anti-revolutionary armed forces and besieged our guerrillas before liberation. At the beginning of this year, he joined the "Intelligence Bureau" spy organization in Hong Kong. These five spies had all received specialized espionage training in communications, the use of hand grenades, and pistols. After infiltrating Guangzhou in June, their sinister plans were thwarted before they could be realized, and they were arrested by our public security organs.

Another group of spies, Zhu Hanguang, Bai Jinzhen, Lü Huakun, Liu Jintang, Wu Hua, and Zeng Zhiqiang, were dispatched by the Taiwan Kuomintang "Central Committee Second Group" and "Intelligence Bureau" spy agencies and infiltrated Huiyang, Heyuan, Shaoguan, Qingyuan, and other places in July and August. They conspired to carry out sabotage activities in areas affected by floods this year. The main tasks assigned to them by the spy agency were to spread rumors in the areas where they were active, develop spy organizations, carry out explosions, arson, and seek opportunities to incite riots. However, after these spies infiltrated the disaster areas, it was completely contrary to their expectations. Due to the cordial care of the Party and the government and the support of people from all over the country, the lives of the people in the disaster areas quickly returned to normal. The people were infinitely grateful to the Party and the government. Therefore, they were never able to realize their sabotage conspiracy. Moreover, as soon as their evil activities began, they immediately aroused the vigilance of the masses. Under the denunciation of the people, they were finally caught one by one.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 4th: Guangdong Province's judicial organs recently handled two espionage cases. With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court sentenced Wu Bailian, a Kuomintang spy with heinous crimes, to death and executed him immediately. Spies Wang Da and Lai Gui surrendered themselves. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate of Guangdong Province decided to grant leniency and exempt them from criminal punishment.

The spy Wu Bailian, who was sentenced to death, was a "triad" member before liberation. He robbed and extorted everywhere in Dongguan County. After liberation, he fled to Hong Kong. In 1955, he joined the Taiwan Chiang gang's "Intelligence Bureau" spy organization and was appointed "Fishermen's Brigade Commander." In September 1956 and October 1958, he was instructed by spy chiefs to carry US-made time bombs and attempted to infiltrate Shekou, Baoan County from Lau Fau Shan in Hong Kong, plotting to carry out explosions during the National Day celebrations. However, due to our strict precautions, both attempts to smuggle failed. In November of last year, when Wu Bailian attempted to smuggle again, he was discovered and captured by local fishermen and sent to the public security organs.

The spies Wang Da and Lai Gui, who surrendered themselves, joined the spy organization last year and infiltrated Guangzhou in June of this year, attempting to carry out attacks, explosions, and other sabotage activities. After infiltrating Guangzhou, they were unable to carry out activities due to the high vigilance of the people and the strict vigilance of the public security organs. The prosperous situation of the socialist construction of the motherland and the policy of severe punishment for resisting and leniency for confessing towards counter-revolutionaries made them realize that working as a spy for the Kuomintang would only lead to a dead end. Therefore, they surrendered themselves to the public security organs and handed over four hand grenades and two pistols. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate of Guangdong Province, considering that they were able to voluntarily confess their crimes and hand over evidence, has decided to grant them leniency, exempt them from criminal punishment, and not prosecute them.

    打击潜入祖国进行破坏的反革命分子
    广东破获处理一批特务案件
    新华社广州4日电　广东省公安机关最近破获一批特务案件，依法逮捕了姚新、陈祖然、朱汗光、白金镇等十一名特务分子。
    特务分子姚新、陈祖然、何根、梁满、陈印莲等都是蒋帮“情报局”的爪牙，他们按照特务机关的指示，分别携带手榴弹和手枪，于今年6月先后潜入广州，企图进行暗杀和爆炸等破坏活动。特务分子姚新，解放前就是一个流氓兵痞，1955年参加台湾国民党“中委会二组”特务组织，被委任为“工运组”组长。去年7月，又参加了“情报局”特务组织。特务分子陈祖然是反动地主，解放前曾参加反革命武装，围攻我游击队。今年初，他在香港参加“情报局”特务组织。这五个特务分子都曾受过通讯联络、手榴弹和手枪的使用等专门特务训练。今年6月潜入广州后，他们的罪恶计划还没来得及实现，就被我公安机关逮捕。
    另一批特务分子朱汗光、白金镇、吕华焜、刘锦棠、邬华、曾志强等六人，是台湾国民党“中委会二组”和“情报局”特务机关所派遣，在今年7、8月间分别潜入惠阳、河源、韶关、清远等地，阴谋在今年遭受水灾的地区进行破坏活动。特务机关交给他们的主要任务是在他们活动的地区散布谣言，发展特务组织，进行爆破、放火、伺机煽动暴乱等活动。但是，这些特务分子潜入灾区后，完全出乎他们的意料，灾区群众的生活由于党和政府的亲切关怀和各地人民的支援，很快就恢复了正常，人民群众对党和政府无限感激，因此，他们始终无法实现破坏的阴谋。而且当他们的罪恶活动刚一开始，立刻就引起了群众的警惕，在人民群众的检举下，终于一一落网。
    新华社广州4日电　广东省司法机关最近处理了两起特务案件。广东省高级人民法院经最高人民法院批准，判处罪大恶极的国民党特务分子吴柏连死刑，立即执行。特务分子汪达、赖贵投案自首，广东省广州市人民检察院决定给予从宽处理，免予刑事处分。
    被判处死刑的特务分子吴柏连，解放前是“黑社会”分子，在东莞县到处打劫勒索，解放后逃往香港，1955年参加台湾蒋帮“情报局”特务组织，被委任为“渔民大队长”，1956年9月和1958年10月，曾先后二次受特务头子指派，携带美制定时炸弹，企图从香港的流浮山潜入宝安县蛇口，阴谋在国庆节期间进行爆破活动，但因我戒备严密，两次偷渡都无法得逞。去年11月间，当吴柏连再次企图偷渡的时候，被当地渔民发觉捕获，送到公安机关。
    投案自首的特务分子汪达、赖贵去年参加特务组织后，在今年6月潜入广州，企图进行袭击、爆炸等破坏活动。他们潜入广州后，由于人民群众的高度警惕和公安机关严密警戒，无法进行活动。祖国社会主义建设蒸蒸日上的形势和对反革命分子抗拒从严、坦白从宽的政策，使他们认识到为国民党充当特务只有死路一条，遂向公安机关投案自首，并交出手榴弹四个、手枪二支。广东省广州市人民检察院考虑到他们能主动交代罪行，交出罪证，已决定对他们从宽处理，免予刑事处分，不予起诉。
