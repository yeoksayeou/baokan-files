    The Radiant Achievements of the Great Leap Forward in China
    ——On the China Pavilion at the Brno International Fair
    By our correspondents Yang Yi and Lin Hai
    "From here, we have seen the glorious achievements of China's Great Leap Forward..." This is a sentence often heard and seen in the discussions and inscriptions of the millions of visitors to the China Pavilion at the Brno International Fair.
    From September 5th to 20th, the first International Machinery Fair held in Brno, the center of Czechoslovakia's machinery manufacturing industry, was attended by thirty countries from Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. There were strong exhibition groups from socialist countries, commercial firms from capitalist countries including three hundred private companies, and representatives from the trade circles of economically underdeveloped countries such as Iraq, Tunisia, and Argentina. Tens of thousands of machine tools and mechanical products were displayed in the exhibition area of over 100,000 square meters. They attracted the attention of people from all walks of life around the world. More than two million people visited this fair in half a month, including many foreign guests from afar. The China Pavilion was recognized as one of the most noticed and welcomed exhibition halls.
    As you walk through the gates of the fair, you are greeted by two tall red gate towers in a national style, adorned with the national emblem of the People's Republic of China. These are the main and side entrances of the "T"-shaped China Pavilion. During the fair, this place was crowded with a constant stream of people all day long. As you squeeze into the pavilion with the crowd, you can see the surrounding walls covered with huge charts about China's Great Leap Forward. More than two thousand types of machine tools and mechanical products produced during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 are carefully arranged and exquisitely placed in the exhibition area of over three thousand square meters. From these displays and the large posters emblazoned with the general line for socialist construction of "Going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," it is not difficult to understand that this is a microcosm of the brilliant achievements of China's Great Leap Forward.
    Among the diverse exhibits in the China Pavilion, mainly featuring machine tools, textile machinery, and electrical machinery output, one can see coordinate boring machines with hole spacing processing accuracy not exceeding 0.005 mm and lead screw lathes with pitch errors not exceeding 0.003 mm. Next to them are electric copying milling machines that process various complex parts and are electrically controlled, and ultrasonic drilling machines for processing glass. In terms of textile machinery, narrow-width spinning frames and carding machines that card 20 kilograms of cotton per hour are exhibited, which are very popular. Various diesel engines, tractors, polarographs, precision instruments, and telecommunications equipment displayed at one end of the exhibition hall were also welcomed by visitors. The audience was also most interested in cobalt-60 therapy machines for treating cancer, high-strength alloy structural steel, and various ores.
    After the opening ceremony on September 5th, the Czechoslovak government delegation, led by Prime Minister Široký, visited the China Pavilion. Prime Minister Široký was very interested in the large vertical lathes, electron tubes, and other exhibits. He said, "These products show the technical level of Chinese industry and the significant gains China has made in the Great Leap Forward." On September 14th, Czechoslovak President Novotný also visited the China Pavilion. He highly praised the diesel engine motor that China had improved based on Czechoslovak blueprints. He also praised the cobalt-60 cancer treatment machine, saying that it could compete with the most advanced products in the West, allowing the West to recognize the scientific and technological level of socialist countries. After the visit, Comrade Novotný warmly congratulated the staff of the China Pavilion on China's remarkable achievements. Government delegations from Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Albania also wrote enthusiastic praises in the guest book after visiting the China Pavilion.
    On September 6th, the day the fair officially received visitors, thousands of people bathed in the autumn sun and flocked to the fair early in the morning, many of whom went to the China Pavilion first, standing there waiting to enter. Like a group of Soviet chemical workers passing through Brno on a tour, they only had two hours to visit all fifteen pavilions of the entire fair, but when they came to the China Pavilion, the various products displayed here, especially medical equipment and chemical products, aroused their great interest. They stayed here for half an hour. Before leaving, they enthusiastically wrote in the guest book: "We are sincerely delighted with the achievements of the great Chinese people's science and technology. We expect you to achieve even greater success." Many Czechoslovakian visitors were very impressed with the China Pavilion. They were as delighted with the progress of China's machine-building industry as if it were their own achievement. One visitor said: Such good machines are proof that China will catch up with England very early. Some said that your brilliant exhibition demonstrates the soaring enthusiasm of the Chinese working people under the leadership of the Communist Party, and also proves that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system.
    The China Pavilion also surprised some visitors from capitalist countries. The cobalt-60 cancer treatment machine exhibited at this exhibition was only available at the China Pavilion and the Canadian booth. Before seeing the Chinese exhibits, some Canadian businessmen had always thought that they were the only country exhibiting this cancer treatment machine at this fair. However, when the China Pavilion also exhibited a well-made cobalt-60 cancer treatment machine, they were greatly surprised. The manager of the famous West German Krupp factory also had to admit that Chinese industry had developed really fast, especially electron tubes and precision instruments, etc. Many businessmen from capitalist countries said that they had not expected China to leap forward so quickly in industry. They were eager to do business with China, and many people came to talk to the Chinese exhibition group about trade, asking whether the exhibits in the China Pavilion were for sale.
    As the "Red Right Newspaper" of September 14th well said, "What is happening in the new China is not progress, but an impact; it is an impact that enables a backward country to catch up with the level of today's advanced countries in the shortest period of history, and it is an impact that shows the world that the socialist system is incomparably superior to the capitalist system!"

    中国大跃进的光芒四射
    ——记布尔诺国际博览会中的中国馆
    本报记者　杨翊　林海
    “我们从这里看到了中国大跃进的光辉成就……。”——这是从参观布尔诺国际博览会中国馆的上百万观众的谈论和题词中所经常听到和看到的一句话。
    从9月5日到20日，在这捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业中心布尔诺举行的第一届国际机械博览会，有亚洲、非洲、欧洲和美洲的三十个国家参加，这里有社会主义国家的实力雄厚的展览团，有包括三百家私人公司的资本主义国家的商行，还有来自伊拉克、突尼斯和阿根廷等经济不发达国家的贸易界的代表们。在十多万平方米的展览场地上，陈列着数万种工作母机和机械产品。它们吸引了世界各地各阶层人士的视线。半个月中有二百多万人访问了这个博览会，其中包括许多来自远方的外国客人们。中国馆被公认为最受观众注意和欢迎的展览馆之一。
    当你走进博览会的大门，映入眼帘的便是两座饰有中华人民共和国国徽的民族风格的高大红色门楼，这便是“T”字形的中国馆的正门和侧门。博览会开放期间，这里整日拥塞着川流不息的人群。当你随着人流挤入馆内，就可看到四周墙壁上挂满了有关中国大跃进的巨幅图表，两千多种在1958年大跃进中生产的工作母机和机械产品经过细心的安排，精致地安放在三千多平方米的展览场中。从这些陈设以及镶钉着“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的社会主义建设总路线的大型招贴画中，人们不难了解到，这儿就是中国大跃进辉煌成绩的缩影之一角。
    在以工作母机、纺织机械和电机产量为主的名目繁多的中国馆展品中，人们可以看到加工孔距不超过千分之五公厘的座标搪床和螺距误差不超过千分之三公厘的丝杆车床，在它们旁边是加工各种复杂机件并用电气控制的电气仿型铣和加工玻璃用的超声波钻床。纺织机械方面展出了狭幅细纱机和每小时梳棉二十公斤的梳棉机等令人喜爱的机器。在展览馆一端陈列的各种柴油机、拖拉机、极谱仪、精密仪器和电讯设备也受到参观者的欢迎。观众们最感兴趣的还有治癌症用的钴六十治疗机、高强度合金结构钢和各种矿石等。
    在9月5日的开幕式后，以西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团参观了中国馆，西罗基总理对我们展出的大型立式车床、电子管等都很感兴趣，他说，“从这些产品中可以看出中国工业的技术水平，并且可以看出中国在大跃进中所取得的重大收获”。9月14日捷克斯洛伐克总统诺沃提尼也参观了中国馆，他对中国根据捷克斯洛伐克的图纸而加以改进的柴油机马达十分赞赏，他也夸奖钴六十治癌机说，这可拿来同西方最先进产品相抗衡，使西方认识社会主义国家的科学技术水平。诺沃提尼同志参观后向中国馆的工作人员热烈祝贺中国的惊人成就。保加利亚、德意志民主共和国和阿尔巴尼亚等国的政府代表团在参观了中国馆后，都在留言簿上写下了热情的赞语。
    在9月6日博览会正式接待观众的这一天，一大清早就有成千上万的人沐浴着秋日的阳光络绎不绝地走向博览会，其中不少的人都首先向中国馆涌去，在那里鹄立等待进场。像一个路过布尔诺的苏联化学工作者旅行团，他们只能用两个小时来参观整个博览会的十五个展览馆，但当他们到中国馆来参观时，这儿陈列的各种产品特别是医疗器械和化工产品引起了他们极大的兴趣，他们在这儿逗留了半个小时。临走时他们在留言簿上热情洋溢地写着：“我们对伟大中国人民科学技术的成就感到衷心的喜悦，我们期望你们获得更大的成就。”许多捷克斯洛伐克的观众对中国馆都留下十分良好的印象，他们就像对待自己的成就一样，为中国机器制造工业进步得这样快而感到欢欣鼓舞。一个观众说：这样好的机器就是中国能很早赶上英国的明证。有的说，你们光辉的展览会，说明了在共产党领导下中国劳动人民的冲天干劲，也证明了社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。
    中国馆也使一些资本主义国家的观众感到惊讶。在这次展览会上展出的钴六十治癌机只有中国馆和加拿大展览台有，而在没有看到中国展品前，一些加拿大商人一直认为也们是在这次博览会上唯一展出这种治癌机的国家，然而当中国馆也展出了一架质地良好的钴六十治癌机时，他们大出意外。著名的西德克虏伯工厂的经理人也不得不承认，中国工业发展得真快，尤其是电子管和精密仪表等等，许多资本主义国家的商人都表示没有想到中国在工业方面跃进得这样快。他们都渴望和中国做生意，不少的人跑来同中国展览团谈贸易，询问中国馆的展品是否出售。
    9月14日的“红色权利报”有一篇文章说得好，“新中国国内所发生的一切，不是行进，而是冲击；是使不久前的落后国家在历史上最短时期内赶上今天先进国家水平的冲击，是向全世界表明社会主义制度较之资本主义制度无比优越的冲击！”
