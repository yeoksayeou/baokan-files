Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: National higher education institutions will begin their 1959-1960 academic year successively from September 1st. After a pleasant month-long summer vacation, faculty and students are welcoming the new academic year's teaching tasks with renewed energy. Before the start of the semester, faculty and students studied the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and held meetings, expressing their determination to respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions.

	During the summer, while on vacation, teachers in various institutions also used their time, under the leadership of the Party committee, to prepare for the new academic year's teaching work. Many institutions, such as Beijing Normal University and Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, summarized and absorbed the experience of the education revolution and made new arrangements for the new academic year's education plans and courses, focusing on teaching. In the new education plans, all institutions attach great importance to strengthening basic courses and Marxist-Leninist theory courses. For example, the various majors of the Biology Department of Xiamen University restored and added some basic courses, so that all students in the department can learn both the basic knowledge of biology and the latest theories and new research techniques in biological science. At the same time, all institutions comprehensively arranged teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, focusing on teaching. They conscientiously implemented the regulations of the State Council, and student labor time is arranged for eight to thirteen weeks per year. Many institutions adopt a combination of centralized and decentralized methods to arrange students' labor time.

	During the summer, many institutions also carried out the work of training teachers and held teaching method seminars to improve teachers' lecturing skills.

	More than 200,000 new students will enter institutions of higher education in the new academic year. All institutions have made preparations to welcome the new students during the summer vacation. Universities in Beijing have set up reception stations at railway stations, and many departments in various schools have also set up welcome stations at the school gates. Senior students warmly welcome each new student, guiding and helping them to complete the admission procedures smoothly.

	After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, more than 20 universities in Beijing successively held school-wide conferences. Hu Xikui, Secretary of the Party Committee and Vice-President of Renmin University of China, put forward five aspects of leap forward measures to all teachers and students at the school-wide conference: to ensure the improvement of teaching quality, properly arrange labor, carry out scientific research, train teachers, and run schools diligently and thriftily.

This newspaper reports that the new academic year for primary and secondary schools across the country in 1959 began in mid-to-late August. After a full rest during the summer vacation, the vast number of teachers and students are welcoming the arrival of the new academic year with greater enthusiasm. The teachers expressed their intention to continue to resolutely implement the Party's education policy under the leadership of the Party, and have the confidence to do a good job in teaching and make significant achievements in further improving the quality of teaching in the new academic year.

	This summer vacation, middle and primary schools, education trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in various places implemented the central government's instructions on ensuring that teachers and students get adequate rest during the summer vacation, and organized a variety of colorful and beneficial summer recreational activities for the vast number of teachers and students. According to their own hobbies and interests, teachers and students in various places participated in various activities such as recuperation, travel, visits, tours, summer camps, literary and art evenings, sports, and science, and had a very happy summer vacation.

	Many regions held teaching research seminars during the summer to discuss issues related to improving teaching and improving teaching quality. For example, at the primary and secondary school Chinese language teaching seminar held by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education in late July, the focus was on discussing the objectives and tasks of Chinese language teaching, teaching materials and methods, improving the level of teachers, and strengthening teaching leadership. The experience of Chinese language teaching was exchanged, and preliminary research was conducted on the current measures and requirements for improving Chinese language teaching. All regions also generally held training classes for middle and primary school teachers, organized teachers to study their professions and prepare lessons, in order to improve teachers' teaching professional ability. For example, the three levels of education departments in Hunan Province, prefectures, and counties (cities) divided their responsibilities and actively organized the work of teacher training. The content of teacher training is based on the urgent needs in the new academic year's teaching, learning what is taught and supplementing what is lacking. About 1,000 teachers in Hengshan County participated in the summer training class, accounting for about one-third of the teachers in public and private schools in the county. The teachers who participated in the training in various places unanimously believed that: through the summer teaching seminars and professional training, they improved their professional abilities and strengthened their confidence in improving the quality of teaching in the new academic year.

	Through the summary of work experience before and after the summer vacation, the advanced ideas and advanced deeds of teachers in various schools have been promoted, and many schools have seen a situation of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, learning from each other, and improving together, and the atmosphere of academic research has gradually become active.

	During the summer vacation, the Party committees and education leading departments of many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also held education work conferences, unanimously affirming the achievements of the education revolution in the past year, opposing the negative and fearful emotions in education work, and requiring all education workers to continue to exert their efforts, continue to resolutely implement the Party's education policy, and further improve the quality of teaching in the new academic year. Therefore, the vast number of teachers are more determined in their confidence in resolutely implementing the Party's education policy and improving the quality of teaching under the leadership of the Party. They are welcoming the new academic year with greater enthusiasm and energy.

    新华社31日讯　全国高等学校1959——1960新学年从9月1日起将陆续开始。广大师生愉快地度过了一个月的暑假以后，正以充沛的精力迎接着新学年的教学任务。开学前夕，广大师生学习了中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，并且纷纷集会，表示要以实际行动响应党中央的伟大号召。
    暑期内，各院校教师在休假同时，还利用时间，在党委的领导下，做好新学年的教学准备工作。北京师范大学、新疆八一农学院等许多院校总结和吸取教育革命的经验，并以教学为主，对新学年的教育计划和课程作了新的安排。在新的教育计划中，各院校都很重视加强基础课程和马列主义理论课程，如厦门大学生物系各专业恢复和增设了一些基础课程，使全系学生既能学到生物学的基础知识，又能学到生物科学上的较新理论和新的研究技术。各院校同时以教学为主，全面地安排了教学、科学研究和生产劳动。他们认真执行国务院的规定，学生劳动时间都安排每年八周至十三周不等。许多院校采取集中和分散相结合的办法，来安排学生的劳动时间。
    暑期中，许多院校还进行了培养教师的工作，举办了教学方法座谈会，以提高教师的讲课水平。
    新学年将有二十多万新生进入高等学校学习。各院校在暑期中都做好了迎接新生的准备工作。北京市各院校在车站设立了接待站，许多学校的各系还在校门口设立了迎新站。老同学都十分热情地迎接每一个新同学，指导和帮助新同学顺利地完成入学手续。
    在中共八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，北京市二十多所高等学校都先后举行了全校性大会。中国人民大学党委书记、副校长胡锡奎在全校师生大会上，向全体师生提出了保证提高教学质量、妥善安排劳动、开展科学研究、培养师资和勤俭办学等五方面的跃进措施。
    本报讯　全国中小学1959年新学年已于8月中下旬先后开学。广大师生经过暑假的充分休息，都以更大的干劲，迎接着新学年的到来。教师们表示要在党的领导下，继续坚决贯彻党的教育方针，并有信心搞好教学工作，为新学年中进一步提高教学质量作出显著的成绩。
    今年暑假，各地中、小学校、教育工会、共青团组织执行了中央关于保证师生暑假期间得到充分休息的指示，为广大师生组织了丰富多彩的有益的暑期文娱活动。各地师生根据自己的爱好和兴趣，分别参加了休养、旅行、参观、游览、夏令营、文艺晚会、体育和科学等各种活动，暑假生活过得十分愉快。
    许多地区暑期召开了教学研究座谈会，讨论了有关改进教学、提高教学质量的问题。如江苏省教育厅7月下旬召开的中小学语文教学座谈会上，着重讨论了语文教学的目的任务、教材教法、提高师资水平和加强教学领导等问题，交流了语文教学的经验，并初步研究了改进语文教学的当前措施和要求。各地还普遍举办了中、小学教师训练班，组织教师进修业务和备课，以提高教师教学业务能力。如湖南省、专署、县（市）的三级教育部门分工负责，积极组织了教师进修的工作。教师进修的内容是根据新学年教学中的迫切需要，教什么就学什么，缺什么就补什么。衡山县有一千左右的教师参加了暑期训练班，约为全县公办、民办学校教师的三分之一。各地参加进修的教师一致认为：通过暑期教学座谈会和业务进修学习，提高了业务能力，加强了提高新学年教学质量的信心。
    各地学校通过暑期前后总结工作经验，教师中的先进思想、先进事迹得到了发扬，许多学校出现了学先进、赶先进、相互学习、共同提高的局面，学术研究的风气也逐渐活跃。
    暑假中，许多省、市、自治区党委和教育领导部门还召开了教育工作会议，一致肯定了一年来教育革命的成绩，反对了教育工作中的消极畏难情绪，要求全体教育工作者继续鼓足干劲，继续坚决贯彻党的教育方针，在新学年中进一步提高教学质量。因而广大教师更坚定了在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党的教育方针、提高教学质量的信心。纷纷以更大的干劲和热情，迎接新学年。
