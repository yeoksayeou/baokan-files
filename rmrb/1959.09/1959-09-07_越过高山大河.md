Crossing Mountains and Rivers...
Bulgaria Yi Keyouliufusiji

Before writing, I opened the world political map...

Look, in the southeastern part of Europe there is a small green area, which is the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Far away in the East, I saw a large yellow area, which is the People's Republic of China. The people of the two countries live on two continents, far apart. The populations of the two countries differ greatly, the traditions are different, and the languages are so different.

In the past, the Bulgarian reactionaries used a contemptuous tone to say the word "China." They often used the imperialist-fabricated legends about the "Yellow Peril" to scare our people. At the same time, perhaps in the past, some reactionaries in China also talked about Bulgaria with contempt...

However, there has long been mutual understanding and love between the people of the two countries. The people of the two countries have had a common destiny—they have suffered the ravages of foreign oppressors. They also had the same desire—to strive for freedom, to be the masters of their own land, and to create happiness for themselves with their own hands. For this wish, the blood of the outstanding and loyal sons and daughters of the two countries flowed into rivers.

The Bulgarian people are extremely concerned about the Chinese people's struggle for national liberation. We have no doubt that the Chinese people will be able to overcome all the difficulties on the road. Indeed, the Chinese people were victorious. Please recall the unforgettable words spoken by our people's great son, Dimitrov, on the historical platform of the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in 1935, praising the heroic deeds of Chinese patriots, and what he said at the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1948. He expressed the firm belief of our people that the Chinese people's long struggle against imperialism and its reactionary agents would end in victory.

The Bulgarian people regard the Chinese people's historic victory in 1949 as a fact of great historical significance that has changed the balance between progressive forces and international reactionary forces. In April 1949, the People's Republic of Bulgaria was the second country after the Soviet Union to establish the closest friendly and diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

The situation has fundamentally changed, and the enslaved people have been liberated. Strangers have become acquainted. The ends of the earth have become neighbors. Members of the united socialist family of nations have become friends and brothers.

In the past, the imperialist lackeys of Bulgaria, acting clever, said that the Bulgarian people and the Chinese people were far apart and had different cultures, so they were incompatible. In fact, their "clever" views were incompatible with the people of the two countries. The liberated people found their close friends and established an indestructible fraternal alliance.

This year, we are celebrating the 15th anniversary of our liberation, and the Chinese people are celebrating the 10th anniversary of their liberation. Ten years, fifteen years, this is only a short period in history, but how profound is the significance! During this period, our distance has been shortened, or rather, we have overcome the geographical separation, reached out our hands of friendship to each other, and everyone has become builders of our common happiness—world peace and socialism. In the history of our two peoples, has there ever been a period when the people have made such great contributions to the progress of mankind in such a short time?

We have become acquainted, and we are further enhancing our understanding of each other through mutual visits, meetings, newspapers, literature, art...

Today, we treat the envoys of the Chinese people as our dearest friends. The struggle of the Chinese people is our struggle; your achievements are our achievements, and we are proud of these achievements.

We are very pleased to point out that the Chinese people view our achievements in the same way on their own land.

Neither geographical distance nor differences in language and culture can separate us anymore. On the contrary, we are becoming more and more united.

When thinking of Bulgarian-Chinese friendship, one cannot help but think of the road to China. We have to go through Moscow to go to China, and the Chinese have to go through Moscow to come to us. We usually talk to each other in Russian. These important facts explain many things.

The Soviet people pointed out to us and the Chinese people the road to victory. The Soviet Union helped us, and the Soviet people are at the forefront of our common historical struggle for peace, progress, and socialism. It is our great friend and ally. The hearts of Bulgarians and Chinese are filled with gratitude to it.

On September 9th, the Bulgarian people celebrate the birthday of their pure, bright, prosperous, and ever-forward Republic. We are celebrating this festival in the fierce battle to realize the accelerated development of our economy and the leap forward in this development. We know that all our friends, our Chinese friends, will celebrate this day with us. Chinese friends are excited about our achievements, so we express our heartfelt and sincere thanks to our Chinese friends.

On the 15th anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation, when we summarize our struggles and victories, we must also point out our contribution to the cause of consolidating Bulgarian-Chinese friendship—a sincere and solid friendship. In the future, we will continue to do our best to consolidate and strengthen this friendship, so that it will benefit the people of both countries, peace, and socialism.

May our friendship last forever!

### 越过高山大河……

    越过高山大河……
    保加利亚　依·柯尤廖夫斯基
    在写之前，我翻开了世界政治地图……
    瞧，在欧洲的东南部有一块不大的涂着绿色的地方，这就是保加利亚人民共和国。在离它很远的东方，我看见了大片涂着黄色的地方，这就是中华人民共和国。两国人民分居在两个大陆，遥遥相隔。两国人口的数目相差悬殊，传统也不一样，而语言也是那样的不同。
    过去，保加利亚的反动派是用轻蔑的口吻来说“中国”这个字的。他们经常用帝国主义者编造的关于“黄祸”的传说来恐吓我国人民。同时，可能过去在中国也有一些反动派用鄙视的态度谈论保加利亚……
    可是，在两国人民之间，早就有着相互的了解和热爱。两国人民曾有着共同的命运——他们备遭外国压迫者的蹂躏。他们也曾有着同样的愿望——争取自由，做自己土地的主人，用自己的双手为自己创造幸福。为了这个愿望，两国人民优秀的、忠实的儿女的鲜血流成了河。
    保加利亚人民极其关怀中国人民为民族解放所进行的斗争。中国人民一定能够战胜道路上的一切困难，对这一点我们没有丝毫怀疑过。果然，中国人民胜利了。请回忆我国人民伟大的儿子季米特洛夫在1935年共产国际第七次代表大会的历史讲坛上所说的赞扬中国爱国主义者的英雄行为的那些令人难忘的话，还有他在1948年保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会上讲的话。他表达了我国人民的坚定信念，即中国人民反对帝国主义及其反动代理人的多年斗争必以胜利而告终。
    保加利亚人民把中国人民1949年的历史性胜利，评价为改变了进步力量和国际反动力量之间的对比、具有重大历史意义的事实。保加利亚人民共和国于1949年4月，在苏联之后第二个与中华人民共和国建立了最紧密的友好关系和外交关系。
    情况根本转变了，被奴役的人民解放了。互不相识的人相识了。天涯成毗邻。统一的各族人民的社会主义大家庭的成员，互相变成了朋友和兄弟。
    过去，保加利亚的帝国主义走狗，自作聪明，说什么保加利亚人民和中国人民距离很远，有着不同的文化，因此是格格不入的。事实上，他们这些“聪明”的观点却是与两国人民格格不入的。解放了的人民发现了自己的亲近的朋友，建立了不可摧毁的兄弟同盟。
    今年，我们庆祝自己解放十五周年，中国人民庆祝解放十周年。十年、十五年这在历史上只是个短暂的期间，然而意义却又多么深长啊！在这个期间，我们的距离缩短了，或者说是克服了地理上的间隔，彼此伸出了友谊的手，大家变成了我们共同的幸福——世界和平和社会主义的建设者。在我们两国人民的历史中，难道有过人民在这样短的时间内为人类的进步作了这么大贡献的时期吗？
    我们相识了，并且正在通过相互访问、会见，通过报刊、文学、艺术……来进一步增进彼此的了解。
    今天，我们把中国人民的使者当作最亲爱的朋友来接待。中国人民的斗争就是我们的斗争；你们的成就就是我们的成就，我们以有这些成就而骄傲。
    我们十分满意地指出，中国人民在自己的土地上，也是这样看待我们的成就的。
    不论是地理上的距离，也不论是语言和文化的不同，再也不能使我们分开。相反的，我们日益团结得更紧密。
    想到保中友谊的时候，不由得就会想到通往中国的道路。我们往中国去要经过莫斯科，中国人到我们这里来也要经过莫斯科。我们通常彼此用俄文交谈。这些重要的事实说明了很多问题。
    苏联人民向我们和中国人民指明了走上胜利的道路。苏联帮助了我们，苏联人民走在我们共同的争取和平、进步和社会主义的历史斗争的前列。它是我们的伟大的朋友和同盟者。保加利亚人和中国人的心中充满了对它的感激。
    9月9日，保加利亚人民庆祝自己的纯洁、光明、繁荣和一往直前的共和国的生日。我们是在为实现加速我国经济的发展，为实现这一发展中的跃进的激烈战役中庆祝这个节日的。我们知道，我们所有的朋友，我们的中国朋友都要和我们一道庆祝这个日子。中国朋友为我们的成就而兴奋，因此，我们对中国朋友表示衷心的、真诚的感谢。
    在保加利亚解放十五周年的日子里，当我们总结我们的斗争和胜利的时候，也要指出我们在巩固保中友谊——真诚的、坚如磐石的友谊的事业中的贡献。今后我们仍将全力巩固和加强这种友谊，使之为两国人民、为和平和社会主义造福。
        祝我们的友谊万古长青！
