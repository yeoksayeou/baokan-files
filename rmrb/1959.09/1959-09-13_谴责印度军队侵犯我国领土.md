Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress continues to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue.
Condemning the Indian Army's Invasion of Our Territory
Firmly Opposing the Indian Government's Imposition of Unilateral Claims on the Border Issue onto China
Hoping the Indian Side Attaches Importance to Sino-Indian Friendship, Resolving the Sino-Indian Border Issue Comprehensively Through Friendly Consultation Based on the Five Principles

The Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress held its seventh expanded meeting today to continue discussing the Sino-Indian border issue. The committee members who spoke at the meeting firmly opposed the Indian government's imposition of unilateral claims on the border issue onto China, severely condemned the Indian army's invasion and occupation of Chinese territory, and hoped that Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government would attach importance to Sino-Indian friendship and comprehensively resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultation based on the Five Principles.

Chairman Zhu De presided over today's meeting.

The so-called McMahon Line is the product of British imperialism's policy of aggression. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never recognize this illegal boundary, regardless of pressure from any source.

Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: The boundary line between China and India should not be unilaterally determined by India; this is an extremely clear principle. Regarding the so-called McMahon Line, she said, Mr. Nehru is very familiar with international law. May I ask, what legal effect does a treaty have when representatives of one country do not participate and it is not approved by the central government of one country? Is it not illegal? She said that even the Tibetan local authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the McMahon Line. After India's independence (1947), they requested Prime Minister Nehru to return all the territory belonging to Tibet. However, Prime Minister Nehru insisted that the "McMahon Line" was a clear and recognized boundary. It is truly regrettable that such a statement came from the mouth of the prestigious Indian Prime Minister Nehru. Shi Liang also said that the name McMahon Line itself is enough to illustrate the aggressive behavior imposed by imperialists. She said that the so-called McMahon Line was rejected even in the old China era, so the new Chinese people, who have stood up, will never accept this illegal boundary, regardless of pressure from any source.

Li Siguang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that for more than a month, for the sake of Sino-Indian friendship, we have remained silent on the anti-China slanders of some people in India, but our magnanimity is not unlimited. Li Siguang said that we hope that the Indian people and influential, wise political figures will quickly stop this reckless action that disregards the overall situation so that India, as one of the founding countries of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, will not have its prestige damaged in the eyes of the world, especially in the eyes of the people of Asia and Africa, and will adopt a friendly negotiation approach to resolve the long-standing Sino-Indian border issue.

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, emphasized in his speech that the so-called McMahon Line is an illegal boundary line that even the then Beiyang warlord government did not recognize. Now the Indian government is putting pressure on China, attempting to impose their unilateral claims on the border issue onto China. This is simply wishful thinking.

Xu Deheng said that the recent anti-China movement launched by Indian expansionists has reached an intolerable point. The current tense situation on the Sino-Indian border is entirely caused by the provocative actions of Indian troops crossing the border. The Indian government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

He also said in his speech that if Indian expansionists attempt to obstruct the democratic reforms in Tibet by creating a tense situation on the border, that is even more wishful thinking. The democratic reforms in Tibet are the urgent desire of the vast Tibetan people, and no force can stop them.

Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation, said that in 1886-1888 and 1904, Britain launched two armed invasions against our country's Tibet, but they failed due to the heroic resistance of the Tibetan people. Later, British imperialism adopted more insidious means, plotting so-called "independence" in an attempt to separate Tibet from China. The McMahon Line is a product of this aggressive plot. India gained its independence from British imperialism's colonial rule. The Indian government should understand all of this, but it is now demanding that China recognize the McMahon Line created by British imperialism and sending Indian troops to invade our border. This approach provides a great opportunity for imperialism to undermine Sino-Indian friendship, which is very regrettable.

Li Dequan questioned: "Does the Indian authorities' adoption of such a stance mean that they are willing to place themselves in the same position as the British colonialists?"

The anti-China movement launched in India has been greatly welcomed by American and British imperialists. Imperialism is doing its utmost to sow discord between China and India and to entice India to abandon its peaceful and neutral policy. This should arouse serious vigilance.

Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University, said: It is obvious to all that imperialists have recently been doing their utmost to sow discord between China and India and to entice India to abandon its peaceful and neutral policy. China and India should maintain a consistent attitude towards imperialism, not forget our common interests, and not be fooled by imperialists. He said that India's current anti-China actions have been greatly welcomed by American and British imperialists, and this cannot but arouse serious vigilance among the people of China and India.

Chen Yuan said: Prime Minister Nehru is one of the founders of the Five Principles. Recently, India has been carrying out provocations on the Sino-Indian border, even resorting to the use of force. This cannot but make people doubt whether Prime Minister Nehru intends to adhere to the Five Principles or to undermine them.

Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that the current Sino-Indian border dispute provoked by India is a continuation and development of the anti-China movement launched by Indian expansionist elements after the Tibetan rebellion. He said that after the Indian expansionist elements stirred up an anti-China upsurge by interfering in our country's internal affairs during our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion this spring and were repelled, they were unwilling to give up and stirred up trouble on the Sino-Indian border issue. Cheng Qian said, "When the map is unrolled, the dagger appears." Indian expansionist elements want to use this method to achieve ulterior motives. They have chosen the wrong target.

Cheng Qian welcomed Nehru's recent expression of willingness to resolve the border issue through holding meetings. However, he expressed firm opposition to Nehru's statement that "after largely accepting the McMahon Line, he is prepared to discuss any interpretation of the McMahon Line." He said: This method of proposing preconditions before negotiations can only block the door to resolving the issue through negotiation.

He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that when British imperialism secretly signed the so-called McMahon Line with the representatives of the 13th Dalai Lama, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely opposed it and publicly protested. Now, Indian Prime Minister Nehru wants to impose the so-called McMahon Line on China again, which is resolutely opposed by the 650 million Chinese people. As a follower of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I am especially indignant and resolutely opposed.

He Xiangning said that both China and India have suffered deeply from imperialist oppression and exploitation, and the people of China and India both hope for peace and friendship. She believes that the vast majority of the Indian people will not be deceived by the reactionary propaganda of imperialists and Indian expansionists and will, like the Chinese people, resolutely oppose acts of invading Chinese territory and undermining Sino-Indian friendship.

We must resolutely counter India's anti-China movement in order to defend Sino-Indian friendship and develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries.

Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: We must resolutely counter India's anti-China movement. Only in this way can we defend Sino-Indian friendship and develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries. This is not only the hope of the Chinese people but also in the interests of the Indian people.

Zhang Zhizhong sharply criticized the Indian government's unilateral, arbitrary, and tension-creating approach to the Sino-Indian border issue. He advised the Indian government to be clear-headed and "not to seek trouble."

Zhang Zhizhong expressed great indignation at the actions of Indian right-wing parties openly gathering thugs to hold anti-China demonstrations in front of our embassy and consulates in India and insulting our leaders. He said: Compared with the restraint shown by the Chinese government and the Chinese people, how will Prime Minister Nehru explain himself?

Zhang Zhizhong pointed out that Indian reactionaries clamor that China is "invading" India and slander China as "imperialist." This is "the greatest lie in the world." He said: China has never invaded others. We have not invaded India in the past, we are not invading India now, and we will never invade India in the future. But right now, it is the Indian army that has occupied Chinese territory.

Cai Chang, Chairman of the National Women's Federation, said that the Indian government and anti-China elements in the parliament, as well as some political figures, have actually resorted to the trick of "a thief crying 'stop thief,'" reversing black and white, slandering China as having "invaded" India, and launching a second anti-China upsurge. Chinese women cannot but feel extremely indignant.

Cai Chang pointed out that the Indian army's aggressive acts of crossing the border to provoke are not an isolated incident. When our government suppressed the rebellion in Tibet, Indian expansionists openly interfered in our internal affairs. Now, they have gone even further, openly disregarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and carrying out armed provocations on the border. This is a completely logical development.

Cai Chang said that Mr. Nehru and the Indian government want to use pressure from military, diplomatic, and public opinion fronts to make our 650 million people submit. This is absolutely impossible! And the attempt by some right-wing parties in India, together with imperialism, to undermine the friendship between the people of China and India is also a futile effort.

Cai Chang said that the people of China and India were both just liberated and independent from long-term imperialist oppression and plunder. The Chinese people want to defend their sacred borders, maintain the friendship between the people of China and India, and also hope that the Indian people will not allow a few expansionist elements and imperialist elements to carry out anti-China conspiracies and undermine the friendship between the people of China and India.

British imperialism used shameless methods to tamper with China's national border. Prime Minister Nehru should not forget the painful historical lessons of imperialist sowing of discord.

Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cited ample facts in his speech to expose how British imperialists used extremely shameless methods to tamper with China's national border and impose the illegal McMahon Line on China. He said that, as Premier Zhou has already pointed out, until 1917, the map "Tibet and its Neighboring Countries" published by the Indian Survey Bureau, as well as the map attached to the 1929 Encyclopedia Britannica, showed the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border in the same way as Chinese-published maps. Zhu Kezhen said that in the Thames Survey Map published in 1927 (the front page of this map stated that it was dedicated to Emperor George V of the British Empire, and the cartographer was the Royal Cartographer Bartholomew), which was as authoritative as the map attached to the Encyclopedia Britannica, there was no McMahon Line either. This was also the case on the fifth edition of the Oxford Advanced Atlas published by Oxford University in 1936. However, on the seventh edition of the Oxford Advanced Atlas in 1942, a red line appeared for the so-called McMahon Line, but the original boundary line still existed. On the map published by George Goteil and the Dumby Library in 1945, the boundary line was still the same, but the McMahon Line was drawn with a dotted line north of the boundary line. In the map attached to the American edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica published in 1947, only the dotted line of the McMahon Line remained, and the original national boundary line was gone. And after 1950, the McMahon Line became a solid line on the Philips map I saw. Zhu Kezhen said: "Why didn't the British Royal Cartographers draw the McMahon Line on the map from 1914 to 1936, but waited until after 1936? Was it because after the Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale invasion of China in 1937, there was an opportunity to take advantage of the situation? Why did they change the McMahon Line from a dotted line to a solid line after 1947 and 1948? Was it because India became independent in July 1947 and China was liberated in October 1949, and the peaceful coexistence of the two major powers in East Asia was not in the interests of imperialism, so imperialism wanted to sow discord?"

Zhu Kezhen said: Prime Minister Nehru should be clear about the imperialist tricks of sowing discord. In his outstanding book "The Discovery of India," Prime Minister Nehru mentioned more than once how imperialism sowed discord between Hindus and Muslims, so that the two religious groups, which could have lived together peacefully, became like enemies, even killing each other in 1945 and 1946. This painful history is not only unforgettable for the people of India and Pakistan, but also for all Asians.

Zhu Kezhen pointed out: Although China and India have different political systems, although the two countries have different languages, religions, and customs, and although the boundary lines of the two countries have not yet been determined, the people of China and India have been able to live together peacefully for two thousand years. How could it be that after the prime ministers of the two countries advocated and published the Five Principles for maintaining peace in 1954, friends have turned into enemies? Zhu Kezhen said: I hope that Indian Prime Minister Nehru can awaken to the imperialist tricks of sowing discord, be able to value the traditional friendship between China and India, and handle the Sino-Indian border issue in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Although there are difficulties at present, there will always be a way to resolve them reasonably.

The Indian government must make a wise choice between justice and evil. Indian troops and administrative personnel must immediately withdraw from the occupied Chinese territory.

Liu Wenhui, Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, warned the Indian government: "Now, the Indian government, headed by Prime Minister Nehru, must make a wise choice between justice and evil, light and darkness." He said that imperialists fear that the world will not be in chaos and are doing everything possible to undermine Sino-Indian friendship in order to reap the benefits. The Indian government must be seriously vigilant about this.

Liu Wenhui emphasized that the Chinese people love peace, cherish Sino-Indian friendship, and are loyal to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade our territory and harm our national dignity. He said that we resolutely oppose India's provocative actions, and Indian troops and administrative personnel must immediately withdraw from the Chinese territory they have occupied.

Lu Han, Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that some people in India have not only forgotten India's historical experience but have interfered in China's internal affairs, sheltered Tibetan rebels, and are now intentionally creating disputes on the Sino-Indian border issue, slandering our country as "imperialist" and attempting to force China to accept the illegal boundary line concerning the Sino-Indian border that the Indian government inherited from British imperialism. Our people express extreme anger at these unfriendly actions. We have never occupied an inch of other people's land, but we will never give our own land to others. We do not threaten others, nor can we be threatened by others. The Indian government and Mr. Nehru should clearly recognize this.

Deng Chumin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: Mr. Nehru should know better than us that McMahon was British. Mr. Nehru should also remember better than us the British colonial rule over India and the various crimes committed by Britain, using India as a base, attempting to occupy Chinese Tibet, and invading China. Both China and India should regard British aggression as a painful lesson, regard the McMahon Line as a mark of British aggressive policy, and work together to eliminate it.

Deng Chumin said: Regarding the dispute over the boundary between China and India, there are two paths to take today. One path is to consider the historical background and current actual situation of China and India and comprehensively resolve it through friendly consultation in a prepared and step-by-step manner based on the Five Principles. The other path is the old path of British imperialism, forcibly imposing the illegal McMahon Line on China. The former is not only beneficial to the people of China and India but also beneficial to the peace of Asia and the world. The latter is just the opposite. The Indian government itself will be the first to suffer. Which path to take? Now is the time for the Indian side to choose.

Who exactly is it that drew a bold line and included the territory of other countries into their own? It is India, not China.

Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said in his speech that the Indian government should restrain its provocative edge and not shoot itself in the foot. He said that the Indian government is fantasizing about using the McMahon Line, which even British imperialism failed to achieve in the past, as the basis for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue, even resorting to the use of force to put pressure on China and forcing China to accept it. This approach, in addition to arousing the unparalleled anger of the 650 million Chinese people, will not bring any benefit to India.

Wang Shao'ao said that Prime Minister Nehru disregarded the facts. It is clearly the Indian army that is crossing the border to provoke, but he insists that China has invaded Indian territory and has made various accusations against the Chinese government. Not only that, but the Indian authorities have also condoned some people with ulterior motives in India to carry out vicious attacks and slanders against China. Are all these actions for the sake of Sino-Indian friendship? Are they in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?

Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, sternly refuted the recent attacks launched by Nehru against our country on the Sino-Indian border issue. She said: Nehru believes that Chinese maps "very roughly include part of Ladakh with a bold stroke." This is a complete and utter slander. Let us see, who is it that includes the territory of other countries into their own? Regarding the boundary between our country and Ladakh, the maps published by our country have always been marked according to traditional customs. The map "Punjab, the Western Himalayas, and Parts Bordering Tibet" drawn by the British John Walker under the order of the Board of Directors of the East India Company is quite close to the way our country's published maps mark this section of the boundary. It was the British and later the Indian side that included large tracts of our country's territory within Ladakh. It is absolutely not the case that China included part of Ladakh within its own territory. Why does Nehru close his eyes and disregard the facts? Moreover, India's inclusion of large tracts of our country's territory within its own territory is not limited to this one area. For example, the way the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan is drawn also adopts the same trick of changing the sky and replacing the earth, including a large tract of our country's territory of 90,000 square kilometers within India's territory. Who is it that includes the territory of others as their own with a bold stroke!

The meeting continued in the afternoon.
Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The seventh expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress continued this afternoon to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue.

China is as open and aboveboard as the sun, and no slander or vilification can deceive people.

Xirao Jiacuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China, said in his speech that although some people in India are wantonly slandering and vilifying China, it cannot deceive anyone. China is as open and aboveboard as the sun, which is very clear to everyone.

Xirao Jiacuo said that many of the remarks made by Mr. Nehru after the rebellion in Tibet occurred and many of the remarks made in the past month or so are very contradictory. Xirao Jiacuo used the facts of his own personal experience as a Tibetan to refute India's shameless clamor on the Sino-Indian border issue. Regarding the McMahon Line, he said that around the time of the Simla Conference, he was studying Buddhism in Lhasa. At that time, he heard representatives of the three major monasteries in Lhasa who returned from the conference say that the Simla Conference ended unhappily. The representatives of the central government sternly refuted the fallacies of the British representatives at the meeting, making the British representatives speechless and unable to respond. The meeting ended without any results. The so-called McMahon Line was secretly drawn by the British representatives behind the backs of the Chinese representatives and was imposed on the Chinese people by British imperialism. As far as he knew, not only the Tibetan people but also many upper-level figures in the Tibetan local government opposed the McMahon Line, believing that this behavior of British imperialism was a very despicable trick.

Xirao Jiacuo emphasized that since the Chinese people did not recognize the so-called McMahon Line created by British power in the past, of course, the Indian government has even less reason to force the Chinese people to accept this illegal boundary today.

Xirao Jiacuo said that the Chinese government and the Chinese people have repeatedly tolerated India's repeated border provocations by the Indian army and India's anti-China movement. This tolerance is to maintain Sino-Indian friendship. However, tolerance has its limits. The Indian government should wisely abandon its military threats and adopt a friendly consultation approach to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute through negotiations. He repeatedly expressed his complete support for the position, attitude, and principles adopted by the Central People's Government in resolving the Sino-Indian border issue.

Fu Zuoyi, a non-party democratic personage, said in his speech that the Indian government's attempt to use anti-China clamor and the pressure of imperialist public opinion to impose unilateral border claims based on the so-called McMahon Line on China will inevitably be futile.

Fu Zuoyi said that China and India are not only countries that gained independence almost at the same time but also the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which has further developed friendly relations. This has laid a good foundation for reasonably resolving the border issue through negotiations. However, some ulterior motives of right-wing politicians in India have recently been trying to create tension on the Sino-Indian border issue, undermine Sino-Indian friendship, and launch a new anti-China wave. It is regrettable that Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government have actually condoned and fueled this rampant clamor.

Fu Zuoyi pointed out that Prime Minister Nehru has always stood on the position of advocating peaceful coexistence and has been respected by people. However, he is now seeking the support of imperialist and right-wing politicians' anti-China remarks, which is not glorious for Prime Minister Nehru but a great irony.

Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The Indian government, disregarding the fact that it sent troops to cross the border and invade our country's Tibetan border, bites back that our army is invading. This can be described as 'making a false accusation first' and is extremely absurd!"

He said that more than ten years ago, India was a British colony, and China was also a semi-colony of foreign imperialism. This can be regarded as a shared-suffering country. Today, the struggle of both countries against colonialism has been victorious. They should abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly guard against any aggressive conspiracy of imperialists, and safeguard the independence that has been achieved. However, the Indian government has actually inherited the mantle of British imperialism and adopted an unfriendly attitude towards friends. This cannot but make people feel unexpected.

Cai Tingkai believes that adopting a friendly and consultative attitude to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue is in line with the wishes of the vast majority of people in China and India. If some people are still obsessed with their mistakes, they will inevitably suffer the consequences.

The people of China and India must be vigilant against the conspiracy of Indian expansionist elements to deliberately undermine the Five Principles and resolutely block the anti-China wave in India.

Liu Geping, Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, said that the current dispute over the Sino-Indian border issue is entirely provoked by some expansionist elements and people with ulterior motives in India. He said that when our country suppressed the Tibetan rebellion this spring, Indian expansionist elements took many unreasonable actions to interfere in our internal affairs. Now that Tibet is undergoing democratic reforms and the face of Tibet is changing day by day, the Indian interferers are unwilling to see the elimination of Tibet's barbaric, reactionary, and cruel serf system, and since August of this year, they have used the Sino-Indian border issue to carry out shameful provocations.

Liu Geping said that the Indian expansionist elements, who are colluding with Western imperialists, are absolutely unwilling to see the friendship between the people of China and India, and they deliberately undermine the Five Principles. We must be vigilant and never allow their provocative conspiracy to succeed.

Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the tense situation caused by the Sino-Indian border issue cannot be seen only as due to the undetermined border, but is inseparable from the occurrence and suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and is also a part of the conspiracy plan of imperialists and foreign expansionist elements.

Li Zhuchen said that it is very obvious that the democratic reforms in Tibet have begun, and the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet, with whom the Indian expansionist elements sympathize, will never be able to ride on the heads of the Tibetan people to oppress and exploit them at will. This makes them unable to hide their inner disappointment and hatred, so they aggressively clamor about the border issue, creating a new upsurge of the anti-China movement.

Li Zhuchen said that Indian interferers once claimed that they had a "natural" sympathy for the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet, and now they are "naturally" doing bad things that are unfavorable to friendly countries. Li Zhuchen called on the people of China and India to be vigilant, resolutely block this anti-China countercurrent, and defend the Five Principles.

Li Zhuchen refuted the slander that China is carrying out "aggression" and "shattering Panchsheel." Li Zhuchen said that the fact is just the opposite. It is not China that does not abide by the Five Principles, but India itself. We know that the method of forcing Chinese people to accept the illegal "McMahon Line" is something that even imperialists dare not do openly, but today the Indian government is openly forcing Chinese people to accept this illegal boundary. Li Zhuchen said that they have gone too far. The Chinese people will never allow anyone to invade their sacred territory!

Xiong Kewu, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that the Indian government has openly interfered in our country's internal affairs since the Tibetan rebellion occurred, to which the Chinese people have adopted a very restrained attitude. However, the Indian government has imposed various pressures on our country and condoned the pro-American elements and expansionist elements in India to launch a new upsurge of anti-China again, which is absolutely intolerable to the 650 million Chinese people.

Xiong Kewu issued a stern warning to the hot-headed Indian expansionist elements, saying that the Chinese people, who have already stood up, will not be intimidated by threats from any source. He hopes that the Indian government will quickly rein in at the precipice. Otherwise, the conspiracy of imperialism and its agents in India will succeed, which will not only be unfavorable to the peace of Asia and the world but also unfavorable to India in the first place.

India must immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who crossed the border to provoke trouble, in order to create conditions for resolving the border issue through friendly negotiations.

Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that although the Chinese government firmly does not recognize the so-called McMahon Line, in order to maintain Sino-Indian friendship and border peace, the Chinese border troops and administrative personnel have never crossed this line. However, after the Tibetan rebellion occurred, the Indian army further invaded and occupied Chinese territory north of the so-called McMahon Line and also openly slandered China as having "invaded" India. This despicable trick of "a thief crying 'stop thief'" can never cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world.

In his speech, Ji Fang resolutely demanded that the Indian government immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who had crossed into Chinese territory and restore the long-standing status quo on the Sino-Indian border in order to ease the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border and create conditions for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly negotiations.

Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, pointed out in his speech that although China and India are now having disputes over the border issue, we are still very restrained because our premise is to maintain Sino-Indian friendship and maintain the Five Principles.

Shao Lizi said that Mr. Nehru once stated that he lacked confidence and trust in China. This is slander and vilification. The Chinese government is the most trustworthy. The facts are by no means as he said. On the contrary, judging from Mr. Nehru's current words and deeds, can we give his government confidence and trust?

Hu Yuzhi, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in his speech that in this Sino-Indian border dispute, the truth is on our side.

Hu Yuzhi refuted Nehru's recent remarks on the Sino-Indian border issue, saying: "Who is threatening whom?" He said, does it mean that the Chinese army threatens India by suppressing the rebellion in its own territory? Our border troops were attacked by Indian troops for no reason and had to defend themselves. Does this also mean threatening India? Is it not a threat to China that Indian troops cross the border to provoke trouble, harbor Tibetan armed bandits, attack our border troops, and Indian aircraft repeatedly violate our border airspace?

Hu Yuzhi said: In the past six months, India has launched two large-scale anti-China movements, and Indian parliamentarians and reactionary newspapers have wantonly slandered our country as "imperialist," and even gathered thugs to demonstrate in front of our embassies and consulates. Can this be said to be "treating" a friendly country "fairly"? Is this not hurting the feelings of the Chinese people?

Hu Yuzhi said that after India's independence in 1947, British imperialism left some inglorious legacies. Some Indian expansionists wanted to continue to treat Tibet as a "protectorate," a "sphere of influence," or a "buffer state." In short, they wanted to put Tibet into the pockets of the Indian big bourgeoisie. Of course, they still used the imperialist tricks, nominally calling it "suzerainty" belonging to China, but in reality, they wanted to use it as a dependency of India.

Hu Yuzhi emphasized that these gentlemen in India are using these outdated imperialist methods, and they will never be able to achieve their ulterior motives. The Chinese people, including the Tibetan people who have been liberated from the serf owners, will never be reconciled to or allow themselves to return to the slavery, exploitation, and oppression under imperialism and the feudal serf system.

Hu Yuzhi advised Mr. Nehru, who claims to have a deep affection for Buddhism, to be able to "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." The "butcher knife" is the set of "interference" and "aggression." "Buddha" is Panchsheel, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said that China and India should resolve the border issue between the two countries comprehensively through friendly consultations, so as to further consolidate the friendship between the people of China and India.

India's attempt to inherit British imperialism's illegal occupation of the Chinese border is not only morally unjustifiable but also legally untenable.

Zhou Gengsheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, refuted point by point in today's speech the Indian side's unilateral claims regarding the Sino-Indian boundary line. He said that these claims are groundless and do not conform to the spirit of peaceful coexistence.

Regarding the so-called geographical principle of using watersheds as boundaries mentioned by the Indian side, Zhou Gengsheng said that in fact, this is not a principle but only one of the methods used to solve the problem of demarcation in the absence of an agreed line or a customary line. Moreover, the watershed as the boundary is not something that a country can freely decide. China has never agreed to use the watershed of the Himalayan peaks as the boundary between China and India. On the contrary, the traditional boundary line recognized by China, such as the section of the Sino-Indian border east of Bhutan drawn on Chinese maps, takes the southern foot of the Himalayas as the boundary.

As for the traditional boundary, Zhou Gengsheng said that this must also be based on facts. The so-called traditional boundary in India is just the McMahon Line, which was unilaterally imposed on China by British imperialism and has always been resolutely opposed by the Chinese central government. Apart from this, there is no basis to provide. On the contrary, China's customary boundary line has ample objective facts to prove it. First of all, the areas within the boundary have always been under the administrative jurisdiction of the Tibetan local government in the past. Secondly, our customary boundary line is basically consistent with the original drawing method of British and Indian maps.

Zhou Gengsheng also said that the Indian government often mentions that India inherited the rights of Britain after independence, including the borders. According to international practice, the new country inherits certain rights of the original country to which it belonged. However, the object of inheritance must be determined and legal. Something that was originally illegally obtained and has never been recognized by the other party's government cannot be made legal through inheritance. India's inheritance of the Chinese border illegally occupied by British imperialism is not only morally unjustifiable but also legally untenable.

As for the international agreements that the Indian government puts forward as the most powerful basis, Zhou Gengsheng said that the treaty they put forward regarding Sikkim is not within the scope of the current Sino-Indian border issue. The 1842 Ladakh Treaty only generally stated that both parties would abide by their respective borders, without specifying the location of the borders. As for using the Simla Treaty as the basis for determining the so-called McMahon Line, it is especially unreasonable. Zhou Gengsheng pointed out: First, the Chinese representative did not sign the so-called Simla Treaty, which is completely invalid for China. Therefore, the boundary line set by the attached map is illegal and cannot bind China from the beginning. Second, the Simla Conference was nominally a tripartite conference between China, Tibet, and Britain. In theory, the Tibetan representative participated in the conference as a representative of the relevant local government along with the representative of the central government. He could not leave the central government and sign a valid treaty with Britain alone. Third, as far as the attached map is concerned, since it was secretly decided by the Tibetan local authorities and the British representative behind the back of the Chinese representative, this constitutes deception in the conclusion of the treaty; and according to treaty norms, treaties resulting from deception are completely invalid. Therefore, the so-called McMahon Line cannot be used as a legitimate border line between China and India at all. In fact, for more than ten years after the Simla Treaty was signed, Britain did not dare to publish the full text of the treaty and the secret exchange of notes, and British-Indian maps did not dare to adopt the drawing method of the McMahon Line for a long time. However, today the Indian government wants to bring out this fundamentally invalid treaty as the basis for India's unilaterally claimed boundary line. How absurd is this!

Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that the Indian expansionist elements failed in interfering in China's internal affairs in Tibet, and are now creating tension between the two countries by borrowing the border issue, in order to achieve their ugly purposes. However, their ugly purposes can never be achieved.

Mao Yisheng said that since the Indian government has provoked a dispute over the border issue, we must give a resolute response and carry this dispute to the end. The major principles of right and wrong must be clarified. Only in this way can we truly strengthen Sino-Indian friendship, implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and maintain world peace.

The Indian government can only resolve the border issue by facing reality and conducting peaceful consultations on the basis of the Five Principles, provided that it abandons the McMahon Line.

Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in a written statement that a history of modern China is a history of the Chinese people's anti-aggression and anti-oppression. If someone wants to impose unilateral will on the Chinese people today, and draw a light stroke to delineate more than 90,000 square kilometers of our country's territory, as was done in the past, it is unimaginable.

Wu Han said that Premier Zhou's statement on behalf of the Chinese government regarding the position and principles on the Sino-Indian border issue takes into account both the complex historical situation and the current reality.

    全国人民代表大会常委会扩大会议继续讨论中印边界问题
    谴责印度军队侵犯我国领土
    坚决反对印度政府把边界问题的片面主张强加于中国
    希望印方以中印友谊为重，根据五项原则，通过友好协商，全面解决中印边界问题
    新华社12日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天举行扩大的第七次会议，继续讨论中印边界问题。在会上发言的委员们坚决反对印度政府把边界问题上的片面主张强加于中国，严厉谴责印度军队侵占中国领土的行为，希望尼赫鲁总理和印度政府要以中印友谊为重，根据五项原则，通过友好协商的方式，全面解决中印边界问题。
    朱德委员长主持了今天的会议。
    所谓麦克马洪线是英帝国主义侵略政策的产物。站起来了的中国人民，不管来自任何方面的压力，都绝不承认这条非法的界线。
    中国民主同盟副主席史良说：中印两国的边界线，不应由印度片面确定，这是极其明白的道理。关于所谓麦克马洪线，她说，尼赫鲁先生对于国际法是非常熟悉的，请问，没有一方国家的代表参加和未经一方国家中央政府批准，这样的条约有什么法律效力？算不算非法？她说，就是西藏地方当局对麦克马洪线也表示不满，在印度独立后（1947年），曾向尼赫鲁总理要求归还属于西藏的全部领土。可是尼赫鲁总理却硬说“麦克马洪线”是明确而得到承认的边界。这种说法，竟然出自负有声望的印度总理尼赫鲁先生之口，真令人不胜遗憾。史良还说，拿麦克马洪线的名称来讲，也足够说明帝国主义者强加于人的侵略行为。她说，所谓麦克马洪线在旧中国时代尚被拒绝，那么站起来了的新中国人民，不管来自任何方面的压力，都绝对不会接受这个非法的界线。
    政协全国委员会副主席李四光说，过去一个多月中我们为了中印友谊，对印度某些人的反华诽谤，保持了沉默，但是我们的宽宏大度也并不是无限无边的。李四光说，我们希望印度人民和有影响的明智的政界人士赶紧制止不顾大体的狂妄行动，使作为和平共处五项原则的创始国之一的印度，在世界人民面前尤其是在亚非人民面前的威信，不致受到损害，并采取友好谈判的方式来解决长期存在的中印边界问题。
    九三学社主席许德珩在发言中强调说，所谓麦克马洪线是连当时的北洋军阀政府都没有承认过的非法界线，现在印度政府竟然对中国施加压力，企图把他们关于边界问题的片面主张强加于中国，这简直是妄想。
    许德珩说，最近印度扩张主义者掀起的又一次反华运动，已经到了令人不能容忍的地步。目前中印边境的紧张局势完全是由印度军队越境挑衅造成的，由此发生的一切后果，印度政府要负全部责任。
    他在发言中还说，印度扩张主义者如果企图通过制造边界紧张局势来达到阻挠西藏民主改革的卑鄙目的，那更是妄想。西藏的民主改革是西藏广大人民的迫切愿望，这是任何力量也阻止不了的。
    全国妇联副主席李德全说，在1886—1888年和1904年，英国曾两次对我国西藏地方进行武装侵略，由于西藏人民的英勇抵抗而未能得逞。以后英帝国主义采取了更阴险的手段，策划所谓“独立”，阴谋使西藏脱离中国。麦克马洪线就是这个侵略阴谋的产物。印度是从英帝国主义的殖民统治下争得独立的，印度政府理应懂得这一切，但是它现在竟然要求中国承认英帝国主义一手制造的麦克马洪线，派遣印度军队侵入我国边界，这种作法给帝国主义破坏中印友谊提供了一个大好机会，这是十分令人遗憾的。
    李德全质问说：“印度当局采取这样的立场，难道是甘愿把自己置于同英国殖民主义者同样的地位吗？”
    印度掀起的反华运动，已经得到美英帝国主义者的大大欢迎。帝国主义极力挑拨中印关系，引诱印度放弃和平中立政策，应该引起严重警惕。
    北京师范大学校长陈垣说：帝国主义者最近以来极力挑拨中印关系，并且想引诱印度放弃和平中立政策，这是明眼人所共见的。对待帝国主义，中印两国态度应当一致，不要忘了我们共同的利益，不要上帝国主义者的当。他说，印度现在的反华行动，已经得到了美英帝国主义者的大大欢迎，这就不能不引起中印两国人民的严重警惕。
    陈垣说：尼赫鲁总理是五项原则的创始人之一。最近印度方面竟在中印边境上进行挑衅，甚至不惜使用武力，这不能不使人怀疑尼赫鲁总理对五项原则究竟是要坚持下去，还是要破坏它呢？
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席程潜说，目前印度挑起的中印边境纠纷，是印度扩张主义分子在西藏叛乱事件以后掀起的反华运动的继续和发展。他说，今年春天，印度扩张主义分子在我国平定西藏叛乱时挑起干涉我国内政的反华高潮被击退以后，他们不肯甘心，又在中印边界问题上兴风作浪。程潜说，“图穷匕首见”，印度扩张主义分子想用这种手法来达到不可告人的目的，那是找错对象了。
    程潜对尼赫鲁最近表示愿通过举行会议的办法解决边境问题的愿望表示欢迎。但是他对尼赫鲁所说的“在大体上接受麦克马洪线之后，准备讨论对麦克马洪线的任何解释”，表示坚决反对。他说：这种给谈判事先提出先决条件的办法，只能堵塞通过谈判解决问题的大门。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席何香凝说，当年英帝国主义同十三世达赖喇嘛的代表秘密地签定所谓麦克马洪线的时候，孙中山先生就曾经坚决反对，并公开表示抗议。现在印度尼赫鲁总理又想把所谓麦克马洪线强加于中国，这是六亿五千万中国人民所坚决反对的。作为孙中山先生的追随者，我尤其愤慨万分，坚决反对。
    何香凝说，中印两国都曾深受帝国主义的压迫、剥削，中印两国人民都希望和平友好。她相信印度绝大多数人民不会受帝国主义者、印度扩张主义者的反动宣传所蒙蔽，同我们中国人民一样，坚决反对侵犯中国领土、破坏中印友谊的行为。
    必须坚决回击印度的反华运动，才能保卫中印友谊，发展两国的睦邻关系。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中说：我们对印度的反华运动必须给予坚决地回击，只有这样才能保卫中印友谊，发展两国的睦邻关系。这不仅是中国人民的希望，也是符合印度人民利益的。
    张治中尖锐地批评了印度政府在中印边界问题上所采取的片面的、武断的和制造紧张的作法。他劝告印度政府清醒一点，“不要自寻苦恼”。
    张治中对于印度右翼政党公然纠集暴徒在我驻印大使馆和领事馆门前举行反华示威和污辱我国领导人的行为，表示十分愤慨。他说：这种行为，同中国政府和中国人民所采取的克制态度比较，尼赫鲁总理将何以自解？
    张治中指出，印度反动派叫嚣中国“侵略”印度，诬蔑中国是“帝国主义”，这是“撒天下之大谎”。他说：中国从来不侵略别人，我们过去没有侵略印度，现在没有侵略印度，将来永远也不会侵略印度。而现在恰恰是印度军队侵占了中国的领土。
    全国妇联主席蔡畅说，印度政府和国会中的反华分子，以及一些政界人士，居然贼喊捉贼，颠倒黑白，污蔑中国“侵略”了印度，掀起了第二次反华高潮。中国妇女不能不感到万分愤慨。
    蔡畅指出，印度军队越境挑衅的侵略行为不是一个孤立的事件。在我国政府平息西藏叛乱的时候，印度扩张主义者就公然干涉我国内政，现在更变本加厉，公然蔑视中国主权和领土的完整，在边界进行武装挑衅，这是完全合乎逻辑的发展的。
    蔡畅说，尼赫鲁先生和印度政府想用军事、外交和舆论等方面的压力，使我们六亿五千万人民屈服，这是绝对做不到的！而印度的一些右翼党派和帝国主义一起想破坏中印两国人民友谊的企图，也是枉费心机的。
    蔡畅说，中印两国人民都是刚从帝国主义的长期压迫掠夺下解放和独立的，中国人民要保卫自己的神圣边界，维护中印两国人民的友谊，也希望印度人民不让少数扩张主义分子和帝国主义分子进行反华阴谋和破坏中印人民的友谊。
    英帝国主义以无耻手法篡改中国国境线。尼赫鲁总理不应忘掉帝国主义挑拨离间的惨痛历史教训。
    中国科学院副院长竺可桢在发言中引证充分的事实，揭露英帝国主义者用极端无耻的手法，篡改中国国境线，把非法的麦克马洪线强加于中国。他说，正如周总理已经指出的，直到1917年印度测量局出版的“西藏及其邻国”图，以及1929年大英百科全书的附图，对中印东段边界的画法，都同中国出版的地图一致。竺可桢说，在1927年出版的和大英百科全书附图一样有权威的泰晤士测量图（这本图的首页写明是献给大英帝国乔治五世皇帝的，作图者是皇家制图员包托罗缪），图中也并没有什么麦克马洪线。到1936年英国牛津大学所出版的第五版牛津高级地图上，也还是如此。但到1942年第七版的牛津高级地图上，出现了所谓麦克马洪线的红线，但原来的疆界线还依然存在。1945年出版的乔治哥台尔和邓培图书馆的地图上，界线也还是照旧，但在界线以北用虚线划出麦克马洪线。到1947年的美国版大英百科全书附图中，只剩了麦克马洪线的虚线，原来的国界线没有了。而到1950年以后，我所看到的菲利浦图上，麦克马洪线就变成实线了。竺可桢说：“为什么英国皇家绘图员从1914年到1936年不把麦克马洪线画到图上，而要等到1936年以后呢？是不是因为1937年日本帝国主义大举侵略中国以后，那时有机可乘，可以趁火打劫。为什么到了1947年、1948年以后，又把麦克马洪线从虚线变成实线呢？是不是因为印度在1947年7月独立了，中国在1949年10月解放了，东亚两大国的和平共处对帝国主义不利，所以帝国主义要挑拨离间呢？”
    竺可桢说：关于帝国主义挑拨离间的伎俩，尼赫鲁总理应该清楚。尼赫鲁总理在他的杰出的书“印度的发现”中，曾经不止一次地提到帝国主义如何挑拨离间印度教和伊斯兰教徒的感情，以致本来可以和平相处的两个教徒团体弄得如同仇敌，甚至于在1945年、1946年互相残杀。这一惨痛的历史，不但印度、巴基斯坦人忘不掉，所有亚洲人也都忘不掉。
    竺可桢指出：尽管中印两国的政治制度不同，尽管两国的语言、宗教、风俗不同，尽管两国的界线还未确定，但是中印两国人民二千年以来一直能和平相处，岂有到了1954年两国总理倡导发表了维护和平的五项原则以后，反而使朋友变为仇敌么？竺可桢说：我希望印度尼赫鲁总理能憣然觉悟到帝国主义的挑拨伎俩，能够重视中印的传统友谊，本着和平共处五项原则的精神处理中印边界问题，那么目前虽有困难，但是总可以找到办法来合理解决的。
    印度政府必须在正义与邪恶面前作出明智的选择。印度军队和行政人员必须立即撤出侵占的中国领土。
    中国国民党革命委员会常务委员刘文辉正告印度政府说：“现在，以尼赫鲁总理为首的印度政府，必须在正义与邪恶、光明与黑暗面前作出明智的选择”。他说，帝国主义者唯恐天下不乱，正在千方百计破坏中印友谊，以便坐收渔人之利，印度政府对此必须引起严重的警惕。
    刘文辉强调说，中国人民热爱和平，珍视中印友谊，忠实于和平共处五项原则，我们从不侵犯别人，但也决不容许别人侵犯我国领土和损害我们国家的尊严。他说，我们坚决反对印度方面的挑衅行为，印度军队和行政人员必须立即撤出他们侵占的中国领土。
    中国国民党革命委员会常务委员卢汉说，印度的一些人不但忘记了印度的历史遭遇，反而干涉中国内政，包庇西藏叛乱分子，现在又在中印边界问题上有意制造纠纷，诬蔑我国是“帝国主义”，企图迫使中国接受印度政府从英帝国主义那里承袭下来的关于中印边界的非法界线。我国人民对这些不友好行径，表示万分的愤怒。我们向来不侵占别人一寸土地，但也决不能把自己的土地让给别人。我们不对人家威胁，也不能受人威胁。印度政府和尼赫鲁先生应该清楚地认识这一点。
    中国民主同盟副主席邓初民说：尼赫鲁先生应该比我们更知道麦克马洪是英国人，尼赫鲁先生也应该比我们更记得英国对印度的殖民统治，以及英国以印度为基地，企图占领中国西藏，侵略中国的种种罪行。我们中印两国都应该把英国的侵略看作惨痛的教训，把麦克马洪线看作是英国侵略政策的烙痕，而共同努力把它消除。
    邓初民说：关于中印两国边界的纠纷问题，今天有两条路可走，一条路是考虑中印两国的历史背景和当前实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备、有步骤地通过友好协商来全面地加以解决；另一条路是英帝国主义的老路，硬把非法的麦克马洪线强加中国身上。前者，不仅有利于中印两国人民，而且有利于亚洲和世界的和平；后者则恰恰相反，首先不利的将是印度政府自己。到底走哪条路？现在是印度方面选择的时候了。
    究竟是谁大笔一挥就把别国的领土划入自己的版图呢？是印度，而不是中国。
    中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊在发言中要印度政府收敛起挑衅的锋芒，不要自己搬起石头打自己的脚。他说，印度政府妄想以英帝国主义过去也未能实现的麦克马洪线，作为解决中印两国边界问题的依据，甚至不惜使用武力对中国施加压力，硬要中国接受。这种做法除了已经激起中国六亿五千万人民的无比愤怒以外，对于印度不会有任何好处。
    王绍鏊说，尼赫鲁总理不顾事实，明明是印度军队越境挑衅，硬说是中国侵略了印度的领土，并对中国政府提出种种指责。不仅如此，印度当局还纵容了印度某些别有用心的人对中国进行恶毒攻击和诬蔑。所有这些行为难道是为了中印友谊吗？难道是符合和平共处的五项原则的吗？
    中国民主促进会副主席许广平在会上严正驳斥了最近尼赫鲁就中印边界问题对我国所进行的攻击。她说：尼赫鲁认为中国的地图“大笔一挥就很粗略地把拉达克的一部分地区包括进去了”。这是彻头彻尾的诽谤。让我们来看，究竟是谁把别国的领土划入自己的版图？关于我国和拉达克之间的边界，我国出版的地图历来是按照传统习惯标明的。英国人约翰·瓦克根据东印度公司董事会的命令所画的“旁遮普、喜马拉雅山西部以及同西藏接壤部分”图，对这段边界的标法，同我国出版的地图相当接近。是英国和后来印度方面把我国的大片领土划入拉达克境内，完全不是中国把拉达克的一部分划入自己的版图，为什么尼赫鲁闭眼不顾事实？而且印度把我国大片领土划入自己境内，并不限于这一块，例如对不丹以东中印边界的画法，采取了同样偷天换日的手段，把我国九万平方公里的大块领土画入印度的版图里去了。所谓大笔一挥把别人的领土划为己有，究竟是谁啊！
    会议在下午继续举行。
    新华社12日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大的第七次会议在今天下午继续举行，讨论中印边界问题。
    中国像太阳一样光明磊落，任何诽谤和诬蔑都欺骗不了人。
    中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错在发言中说，尽管印度有些人肆意诽谤和诬蔑中国，但是，它欺骗不了任何人，中国像太阳一样光明磊落，这是任何人都看得很清楚的。
    喜饶嘉错说，尼赫鲁先生在西藏叛乱发生以后发表的许多言论和最近一个多月来发表的许多言论，是矛盾很多的。喜饶嘉错以一个藏族人亲身经历的事实，驳斥了印度关于中印边界问题的无耻叫嚣。关于麦克马洪线，他说，在西姆拉会议前后，他正在拉萨研究佛学，那时他曾听到参加会议回来的拉萨三大寺代表说，西姆拉会议是不欢而散的。中央政府的代表在会上曾严正地驳斥了英国代表的谬论，使英国代表张口结舌，无言以对。会议毫无结果而散。所谓麦克马洪线，是英国代表背着中国代表秘密划出的，是英帝国主义强加在中国人民头上的。据他所知，当时不仅是西藏人民，西藏地方政府的许多上层人士也都反对麦克马洪线，认为英帝国主义的这种行为，是非常卑鄙的勾当。
    喜饶嘉错强调说，既然过去中国人民都不承认由英国强权制造出来的所谓麦克马洪线，当然，印度政府今天就更没有任何理由强迫中国人民接受这条非法的界线了。
    喜饶嘉错说，中国政府和中国人民对印度军队多次越界进行挑衅和印度的反华运动，一忍再忍。这种忍让，是为了维护中印友谊。但是，忍让是有限度的。印度政府应该明智地放弃武力威胁，采取友好协商的办法，通过谈判，解决中印边界的纠纷。他一再表示完全拥护中央人民政府对解决中印边界问题所采取的立场、态度和方针。
    无党派民主人士傅作义在发言中说，印度政府企图利用反华叫嚣和帝国主义舆论的压力，把依据所谓麦克马洪线作基础的片面的边界主张强加于中国，这必然是徒劳无益的。
    傅作义说，中印两国不仅差不多是同时获得独立的国家，并且又是和平共处五项原则的创始者，进一步发展了友好关系，这就奠定了通过谈判合理解决边界问题的良好基础。但是，印度一些别有用心的右翼政客最近却竭力在中印边界问题上制造紧张局势，破坏中印友谊，掀起了新的反华浪潮。令人遗憾的是，尼赫鲁总理和印度政府竟然纵容和助长了这种猖狂叫嚣。
    傅作义指出，尼赫鲁总理一向站在主张和平共处的立场上，曾经受到人们的尊敬，而他现在竟然求助于帝国主义和右翼政客反华言论的支持，这对尼赫鲁总理不是光荣，而是一个很大的讽刺。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席蔡廷锴说：“印度政府不顾自己派军队越界侵犯我国西藏边界的事实，反噬我军侵略，这真可谓‘无理先告状’，荒唐之至！”
    他说，十多年以前，印度是英国的殖民地，中国也是外国帝国主义的半殖民地，这可算是患难与共之邦。今天，两国反抗殖民主义的斗争都已得到胜利，这就应该遵守五项原则和平共处，共同警惕帝国主义者的任何侵略阴谋，保卫已取得的独立。可是，印度政府竟继承英帝国主义的衣钵，对朋友采取了不友好的态度，这不能不使人感到出乎意料。
    蔡廷锴认为，只有采取友好协商的态度来解决中印两国边界问题，才符合中印两国广大人民的愿望。如果有些人仍然执迷不悟，必将自食其果。
    中印人民必须警惕印度扩张主义分子蓄意破坏五项原则的阴谋，坚决堵住印度的反华浪潮。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会主任委员刘格平说，现在中印边界问题的纠纷完全是印度的一部分扩张主义分子和别有用心的人挑起的。他说，今年春天我国平定西藏叛乱时，印度扩张主义分子采取了干涉我国内政的很多无理行动。现在西藏正在进行民主改革，西藏的面貌正在日益改变，印度干涉者不甘心西藏的野蛮、反动、残酷的农奴制度的消灭，从今年8月起又利用中印边界问题，进行可耻的挑衅。
    刘格平说，同西方帝国主义者相勾搭的印度扩张主义分子，是绝不愿意中印两国人民友好的，他们蓄意破坏五项原则。我们必须提高警惕，绝不允许他们的挑衅阴谋得逞。
    中华全国工商联副主任委员李烛尘说，中印边界问题所引起的紧张局势，绝不能只看成是由于边界未定的原因，而是与西藏叛乱的发生和平定分不开的，也是帝国主义和外国扩张主义分子的阴谋计划的一个部分。
    李烛尘说，很显然，西藏的民主改革已经开始，印度扩张主义分子所同情的西藏上层反动集团，永远再不能骑在西藏人民头上任意压迫和剥削。这使他们再也掩藏不住内心的懊丧和仇恨，因而气势凶凶地借边界问题大肆叫嚣，造成反华运动的新高潮。
    李烛尘说，印度干涉者曾经自称他们对西藏上层反动集团有着“本能”的同情，现在他们又“本能”地做起不利于友邦的坏事。李烛尘要求中印两国人民警惕起来，坚决堵住这股反华逆流，保卫五项原则。
    李烛尘驳斥了所谓中国进行“侵略”，“使潘查希拉支离破碎”的诬蔑。李烛尘说，事实恰恰相反，不遵守五项原则的不是中国，而恰恰是印度自己。我们知道，拿非法的“麦克马洪线”强迫中国人接受的办法，这是连帝国主义也不敢明目张胆去做的事，而今天印度政府却公然强迫中国人接受这条非法的界线。李烛尘说，他们做的太过分了，中国人民决不容许任何人侵犯自己神圣的领土！
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席熊克武说，印度政府自西藏叛乱发生以来，就明目张胆地干涉我国内政，对此中国人民采取了非常克制的态度。但是印度政府竟对我国施用种种压力，并且纵容印度的亲美分子和扩张主义分子，再次发动反华的新高潮，这是六亿五千万中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    熊克武对头脑发热的印度扩张主义分子提出了严正的警告，他说，已经站立起来的中国人民，是不会为来自任何方面的威胁所吓倒的，希望印度政府赶快悬崖勒马。否则，帝国主义及其在印度的代理人阴谋得逞，不仅不利于亚洲和世界的和平，而且首先不利于印度。
    印度必须立即撤回越境寻衅的印军和行政人员，为通过友好谈判解决边界问题创造条件。
    中国农工民主党主席团主席季方说，中国政府虽然坚决不承认所谓麦克马洪线，但是为了维护中印友谊和边界安宁，中国边防部队和行政人员从来不越过这条线，而印度军队却在西藏叛乱发生以后进一步侵入和侵占所谓麦克马洪线以北的中国领土，并且还公然诬蔑中国“侵略”印度，这种“贼喊捉贼”的卑劣手法，绝不能掩盖住天下人的耳目。
    季方在发言中坚决要求印度政府立即撤回越入中国境内的印度军队和行政人员，恢复中印边界久已存在的状况，以缓和中印边界的紧张局势，为通过友好谈判解决中印边界问题创造条件。
    民革中央常委邵力子在发言中指出，尽管中印两国现在在边界问题上发生纠纷，但是我们仍然非常克制自己，因为我们的前提是维护中印友谊，维护五项原则的。
    邵力子说，尼赫鲁先生曾经声明他对中国缺少信心和信任。这是诽谤，是诬蔑，中国的政府是最可信任的。事实绝不是像他所说的那样，恰恰相反，如果按照尼赫鲁先生现在的言行看来，我们对他的政府能够给予信心和信任吗？
    中国民主同盟副主席胡愈之发言说，在这次中印边界纠纷问题中，真理是在我们的一方面。
    胡愈之驳斥尼赫鲁最近关于中印边界问题的言论时说：“到底是谁威胁谁？”他说，难道中国军队在自己的国土内平定叛乱，就威胁了印度吗？我们的边防部队无端遭受印度军队的袭击，不得已而自卫，这也算是威胁印度吗？印度军队越境挑衅，包庇西藏武装叛匪，袭击我边防部队，印度飞机一再侵犯我边境领空，这是不是对中国的威胁呢？
    胡愈之说：半年以来，在印度发动两次大规模的反华运动，印度国会议员和反动报刊大肆诬蔑我国是“帝国主义”，甚至纠集暴徒在我国使领馆门前示威，难道这可以说是“公平对待”一个友好国家吗？难道这不是伤了中国人民的感情吗？
    胡愈之说，1947年印度独立后，英帝国主义留下了一些不光荣的遗产，某些印度扩张主义者想继续把西藏当作“保护国”、“势力范围”、“缓冲国”，总之想把西藏放进印度大资产阶级的荷包里。当然，他们还是使用帝国主义的惯技，名义上叫作“宗主权”归中国，实际上是想作为印度的附属国。
    胡愈之强调指出，印度的这些先生们使用帝国主义这一套早已过时的手法，是绝不能达到他们不可告人的目的的。中国人民，包括从农奴主下面得到解放的西藏人民是决不甘心、也决不容许再回到帝国主义和封建农奴制度的奴役剥削和压迫之下的。
    胡愈之劝告自称对佛教颇有感情的尼赫鲁先生能“放下屠刀，立地成佛”。“屠刀”就是“干涉”“侵略”的这一套东西，“佛”就是潘查希拉，和平共处五项原则。他说，中印两国应通过友好协商、全面解决两国边界问题，这样才能进一步巩固中印两国人民的友谊。
    印度企图继承英帝国主义非法侵占中国边界，不仅在道义上讲不过去，在法律上也讲不通。
    中国人民外交学会副会长周鲠生在今天的发言中逐点驳斥了印度方面关于中印边界线的片面主张。他说，这些主张是没有根据的，是不符合和平共处的精神的。
    关于印度方面提到的所谓以分水岭为界的地理原则，周鲠生说，其实这并不是一个原则，而只是在没有协定线或习惯线的场合，用来解决划界问题的方法之一。而且以分水岭为界，也不是一国能自由决定的。中国从来没有同意以喜马拉雅山脉峰顶的分水岭为中印两国边界；反之，中国所承认的传统边界线，如中国地图所画的在不丹以东的一段中印边界就是沿喜马拉雅山南麓为界。
    至于讲到传统的边界，周鲠生说，这也是要有事实根据的。印度所谓传统的边界只是继承英帝国主义片面强加于中国而一贯为中国中央政府所坚决反对的麦克马洪线，除此以外，提不出什么根据。反之，中国的边界习惯线是有充分的客观事实来证明的。首先，界线以内地区过去一直由西藏地方政府行使行政管辖权，其次，我们边界习惯线同英、印方面地图的原来画法基本上一致。
    周鲠生又说，印度政府方面经常提到独立后的印度继承英国的权利，也包括边境在内。按照国际惯例，新国家是继承原来所属国家的某些权利的。但继承的目的物必须是确定合法的。对于一件原来非法取得而又从未得到对方政府承认的东西，决不能通过继承而变成合法，印度继承英国帝国主义非法侵占的中国边界，不仅在道义上讲不过去，在法律上也讲不通。
    至于印度政府作为最有力的根据提出来的国际协定，周鲠生说，他们所提的关于锡金的条约不在现实中印边界问题的范围，1842年拉达克和约只是泛泛地说双方将恪守各自的疆界，并未指明疆界的位置。至于将西姆拉条约作为确定所谓麦克马洪线的根据，尤其没有道理。周鲠生指出：第一、所谓西姆拉条约，中国代表没有签字，对于中国根本是无效的，因此附图所定的边界线是非法的，自始就不能约束中国。第二、西姆拉会议形式上是中藏英三边会议，论理西藏的代表是以有关地方政府的资格随同中央政府代表参加会议的，他不能离开中央政府而单独同英国签订有效的条约。第三、就附图而言，既然是西藏地方当局和英国代表背着中国代表秘密换文而决定的，这就成为在订约上的欺骗；而按照条约规范，出自欺骗的条约是根本无效的。因此，所谓麦克马洪线根本不能作为中印之间合法的边境线。事实上，西姆拉条约订立后十多年，英国还不敢公布这个条约的全文和秘密换文，英印地图也长期不敢采用麦克马洪线的画法。然而，今天印度政府却要抬出这一根本无效的条约来作为印度片面主张的边界线的根据，这是何等地荒唐！
    九三学社副主席茅以升说，印度扩张主义分子在干涉中国西藏内政问题上失败了，现在又借边界问题制造两国间的紧张局势，来达到他们的丑恶目的。然而，他们的丑恶的目的是永远也不能实现的。
    茅以升说，印度政府既然挑起了关于边界问题的争论，我们就必须给予坚决的回击，并且把这场争论进行到底，大是大非的原则问题必须辩明，只有这样，才能真正加强中印友谊，贯彻和平共处的五项原则，维护世界和平。
    印度政府只有在抛弃麦克马洪线的前提下，面对现实，在五项原则的基础上进行和平协商，才能解决边界问题。
    中国民主同盟副主席吴晗在书面发言中说，一部中国近代史就是中国人民反侵略反压迫的历史，今天如果有人企图像过去那样，以片面意志强加于中国人民的头上，用大笔一挥，轻轻把我国领土划出九万多平方公里，那是不可设想的。
    吴晗说，周总理代表中国政府表明的关于中印边界问题的立场和方针，既照顾到复杂的历史情况，又照顾到目前的现实，它是驳不倒，也绝对歪曲不了的。印度政府只有在抛弃麦克马洪线的前提下，面对现实，在五项原则的基础上，进行和平协商，才能合理解决边界问题。
    中华全国工商联副主任委员胡子昂书面发言说：尼赫鲁总理所谓“中国侵入印度领土”的“论据”之一，是他手上掌握着地图。尼赫鲁总理在印度联邦院讲话说：“证据是对我们有利的，有地图等等。”但是他自己也承认：“中国人也拿出了他们自己的同样古老的对他们有利的地图”。究竟这两幅地图，正确在那一边，姑且不论，平心说理，就应该通过协商、谈判，谋求全面解决。
    胡子昂接着指出：但是尼赫鲁总理不这样做，在他对联邦院的讲话中，使用了武断的语调。尼赫鲁说：“不管他们拥有的地图，是怎样的地图，根据我们的地图，中国巡逻队进来的地方是四、五英里，可能是七、八英里。”换句话说，尼赫鲁总理的意思是，不管中国方面拥有什么样的地图都不可靠，一定要印度提出的地图才是权威。再进一步，只要印度在提出的地图上划一根分界线，那就是印度的边境，就可以把侵略印度的帽子随时扣在邻国的头上。
    胡子昂说，尼赫鲁总理不问是非黑白，不求协商、谈判来全面解决边界问题，同时在国际上大肆宣传，对我国政府施加种种压力，甚至不惜使用武力，这种做法，是全中国人民所万万不能容忍的。
    13日，会议将继续举行。
