    Rushing Ahead, Leaving Father Time Behind
    Many Young Workers in Tianjin Enter 1960
    Several Groups and Workers in Jilin Machinery Factory Complete the Whole Year's Workload
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st -- Tianjin's young workers are carrying out a competition of "comprehensively overfulfilling the plan and entering 1960 ahead of schedule" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. According to preliminary statistics as of September 15th, 522 young workers and 25 youth collectives in the city, calculated by workload, have entered 1960 ahead of schedule, and some have already entered 1961.
    Under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the young workers of the city, holding high the red flag of the General Line, are making great efforts in technical innovation. The Qi Zhiming Youth Milling and Grinding Group of the Gear Workshop of the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has completed more than 26,400 hours of work by September 15th this year, equivalent to 285.28% of the factory's annual production plan. Xu Xiufen and Liu Yulan, young female workers of the Prospecting Machinery Factory, had already stepped into 1960 long ago, and in the first half of September, the two of them completed another two months and five days of work. The Youth Group of the Metalworking Workshop of the Low-Voltage Electrical Appliance Switch Factory, with the help of experienced workers, has made innovations every person and improvements every month. Since the beginning of this year, they have achieved 104 technical innovations, increasing production efficiency by one to one hundred and forty times, completing this year's workload ahead of schedule, and achieving a 100% product qualification rate.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 21st -- In the Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory’s celebratory competition to greet the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation, 24 groups and 690 workers have already completed the 1959 workload and have earned the title of "Red Flag Shock Workers."
    After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the workers gathered to revise the Great Leap Forward plan and put forward the slogan "Advance beyond 1959 and celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation." The entire factory, with "four reds" (high yield, high quality, low consumption, safety) as the goal, launched a "five-same" (same type of work, same business, same machine, same parts, same grade) competition. In the competition, groups and workers of the same type of work formed a competition zone, and each competition zone used the most efficient advanced group or advanced individual as a model. In this way, a competition upsurge of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced" was set off throughout the factory, and the workers broke through quotas one after another. The Ma Liang Group of the Forging and Riveting Workshop welded four meters per person per shift in July. After the competition was launched, it reached fifteen meters, and recently it has reached twenty-three meters. The entire group has already surpassed 1959 in terms of workload. The workers of the three forging groups in this workshop, led by advanced workers Zhao Ziwen and Zhou Hongkui, realized more than 70 technical innovations in one month and completed all of the 1959 workload. The Casting Workshop, which had long suffered from poor casting quality, realized four technical innovations, improved the sand molds, and adopted mud mold casting, increasing the qualification rate of castings from 82.9% in July to 92.7% in early September.

    猛冲猛赶把时间老人甩在后面
    天津许多青工跨进1960年
    吉林机械厂一批小组和工人完成全年工作量
    新华社天津21日电　天津市青年工人开展“全面超额完成计划，提前跨进1960年”的竞赛，向建国十周年献礼。到9月15日初步统计，全市已有五百二十二名青年工人和二十五个青年集体，按工作量计算，提前跨进了1960年，有的已经跨进1961年。
    全市青年工人在党的八届八中全会号召下，高举总路线红旗，大闹技术革新。天津第一机床厂齿轮车间齐之明青年铣磨小组，今年到9月15日已经完成了两万六千四百多个小时的工作量，相当于工厂下达全年生产计划的285.28％。探矿机械厂青年女工徐秀芬和刘玉兰早已跨出1960年，9月上半月她们两人又完成了两个月零五天的工作量。低压电器开关厂金工车间青年小组，在老师傅的帮助下，人人有革新，月月有改进，今年以来已经实现了一百零四项技术革新，使生产效率分别提高一倍到一百四十倍，提前完成了今年的工作量，产品合格率达到百分之百。
    新华社吉林21日电　吉林省机械厂在迎接建国十周年的献礼竞赛中，已有二十四个小组和六百九十名工人完成了1959年的工作量，获得了“红旗突击手”称号。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，工人们就纷纷集会，修订跃进规划，提出了“提前跨过1959年，向建国十周年献礼”的口号。全厂以“四红”（高产、优质、低耗、安全）为目标，开展了“五同”（同工种、同业务、同机台、同部件、同等级）竞赛。在竞赛中，同工种的小组和工人组成一个赛区，每个赛区都以效率最高的先进小组或先进个人为标兵。这样，全厂就掀起了一个“学先进、赶先进”的竞赛热潮，工人们纷纷突破定额。锻造铆焊车间马良小组，7月份每人每班的焊接进度是四米，开展竞赛后达到十五米，最近又达到二十三米，全组按工作量计算，已经跨过了1959年。这个车间的三个锻工小组的工人，在先进工作者赵子文、周鸿奎的带动下，一个月里实现了七十多项技术革新，全部完成了1959年的工作量。长期以来铸造质量不好的铸造车间，实现了四项技术革新，改进了砂型，采用泥型铸造，使铸件的合格率由7月份的82.9％提高到9月上旬的92.7％。
