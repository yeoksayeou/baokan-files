Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 14th: The National Open Hearth Production Technology Conference recently held in Anshan by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry formulated an open hearth steelmaking operation policy of "more charging, faster refining, high temperature, and long life." The conference pointed out that this is an important way to tap the potential of existing open hearth furnaces and rapidly increase steel production. It also called on open hearth workers across the country to conscientiously implement this operating policy, strive to complete the year's open hearth steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule, and make a significant contribution to seizing twelve million tons of steel.

The "more charging, faster refining, high temperature, and long life" open hearth operation policy determined by this conference is based on the summary of ten years of production experience of open hearth furnaces nationwide. In the past few years, many open hearth furnaces across the country have significantly increased steel production without increasing major equipment by adopting measures such as more charging, faster refining, high temperature, and extending furnace life. The red banner unit for small open hearth furnaces nationwide – Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 – increased the charging amount per furnace from the original ten tons to forty-one tons and shortened the smelting time from five hours and thirty minutes to five hours and six minutes after adopting measures for more charging and faster refining. After more charging and faster refining, measures to maintain the furnace body were also adopted, and the operating rate increased from 37% in the past to over 90%, resulting in a multiple increase in the utilization coefficient of the open hearth furnace. After adopting measures for more charging and faster refining, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant increased the charging amount per furnace from the original one hundred tons to one hundred and fifty tons to two hundred and twenty-five tons to three hundred tons. The time for smelting a furnace of steel was shortened from the original ten hours and thirty-four minutes to eight hours and forty-two minutes, and the operating rate increased from the original 61.1% to 86.3%.

Practice has proven that as long as the operating policy of "more charging, faster refining, high temperature, and long life" is comprehensively implemented, it can not only achieve the effects of more charging and faster refining but also extend furnace life and increase the operating rate. Therefore, the concern that more charging and faster refining will affect the furnace body's life is unnecessary.

After full discussion, the conference formulated ten major technical measures, including improving raw material management, transforming the open hearth furnace body structure, adopting ground ingot casting machines, using aluminum-magnesium brick furnace roofs, improving thermal regimes, implementing open hearth furnace overhaul pre-assembly, and strengthening scientific research work. The conference pointed out that if open hearth furnaces nationwide can transform the furnace body structure according to the preliminary proposed plan and expand the charging amount, the open hearth capacity can be increased by more than two thousand tons, which is equivalent to adding four large open hearth furnaces with a capacity of five hundred tons each. Using aluminum-magnesium brick furnace roofs can extend the furnace roof life from over two hundred times to over four hundred times, which is of great significance for improving the furnace operating rate. According to the experience of some factories, the widespread use of ground ingot casting machines can ensure the expansion of the open hearth charging amount in the event of insufficient crane capacity. Enterprises should gradually promote the advanced Soviet experience of open hearth furnace overhaul pre-assembly, which can shorten the overhaul time by 30% to 40%. Improving the thermal regime and increasing the furnace temperature are also extremely important for ensuring the open hearth furnace shortens the smelting time. The conference requested that all open hearth steel plant workers immediately take action, implement measures that can be achieved under the existing conditions immediately, and actively create conditions for those that are not yet available, striving to achieve them in the shortest possible time.

The conference emphasized that to implement the open hearth operation policy and the ten technical measures formulated at this conference, it is necessary to liberate thinking, summon up great energy, fully mobilize the masses, and vigorously promote technical revolution and technical innovation. Only in this way can the implementation of these measures be reliably guaranteed. The representatives studied the experience of the workers of the five large fixed open hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel in carrying out technical performance competitions and unanimously agreed that this is a good method for carrying out mass movements in industrial enterprises. They called on open hearth workers across the country to learn from this experience to ensure the more effective implementation of the open hearth operation policy and various major technical measures, and to promote the continuous improvement of the steelmaking production level.

The conference also conducted evaluations. Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant's No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace and Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steel Plant's No. 10 Open Hearth Furnace were awarded the red banner furnaces for large open hearth furnaces nationwide; Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 Open Hearth Furnace was awarded the red banner furnace for medium-sized open hearth furnaces nationwide; and the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 was awarded the red banner unit for small open hearth furnaces nationwide.

    全国平炉生产技术会议提出平炉操作方针
    多装　快炼　高温　长寿
    新华社鞍山14日电　冶金工业部最近在鞍山召开的全国平炉生产技术会议，制定了“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”的平炉炼钢操作方针。会议指出这是挖掘现有平炉生产潜力，使钢产量迅速增长的重要途径；并且号召全国平炉职工认真贯彻这项操作方针，力争提前十天完成全年平炉钢的生产计划，为夺取一千二百万吨钢作出重大贡献。
    这次会议确定的“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”的平炉操作方针，是根据全国平炉十年来的生产经验总结出来的。过去几年来，全国许多平炉由于采取了多装、快炼、高温和使炉子长寿的措施，在没有增加主要设备的情况下，钢产量有了显著的增加。全国小型平炉的红旗单位——上钢三厂，在采取了多装快炼的措施之后，每炉的装入量由原来的十吨增加到四十一吨，冶炼时间由五小时三十分缩短到五小时零六分。在多装快炼以后，还采取了维护炉体的措施，作业率由过去37％提高到90％以上，使平炉利用系数有了成倍的增长。鞍钢第一炼钢厂在采取多装快炼的措施以后，每炉的装入量由原来的一百吨到一百五十吨，增加到二百二十五吨到三百吨，冶炼一炉钢的时间，由原来的十小时三十四分缩短到八小时四十二分，作业率由原来的61.1％提高到86.3％。
    实践证明，只要全面地贯彻“多装、快炼、高温、长寿”的操作方针，既可以收到多装快炼之效，又可以使炉子长寿，提高作业率。因此，那种认为多装快炼会影响炉体寿命的顾虑，是不必要的。
    会议经过充分讨论，制定了改善原料管理，改造平炉炉体结构，采用地浇机，使用铝镁砖炉顶，改进热工制度，实行平炉大修预装配，以及加强科学研究工作等十项重大技术措施方案。会议指出，如果全国平炉都能根据初步拟订的方案改造炉体结构，扩大装入量，平炉容量就可以增加两千多吨，相当于增加四座五百吨的大平炉。使用铝镁砖炉顶，可以使炉顶寿命由二百多次延长到四百多次，对提高炉子作业率有很大意义。根据一些工厂的经验，普遍采用地浇机铸锭，可以在吊车不足的情况下，保证平炉扩大装入量。各企业逐步推行苏联先进经验——平炉大修预装配，可以使大修时间缩短30％到40％。改进热工制度，提高炉温，对保证平炉缩短冶炼时间也有极为重要的意义。会议要求各平炉钢厂职工要立即行动起来，有条件实现的措施要立即执行；一时条件不具备的，要积极创造条件，力争在最短的时期内实现。
    会议强调指出，贯彻这次会议确定的平炉操作方针和十项技术措施方案，必须解放思想，鼓足干劲，充分发动群众，大闹技术革命和技术革新。只有这样，这些措施的实现才有可靠的保证。代表们研究了鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉职工开展技术表演竞赛的经验，一致认为这是在工业企业中大搞群众运动的好方法，号召全国平炉职工学习这一经验，从而保证更有效地贯彻平炉操作方针和各项重大技术措施，促使炼钢生产水平不断提高。
    这次会议还进行了评比。鞍钢第一炼钢厂一号平炉和鞍钢第二炼钢厂十号平炉，被评为全国大型平炉的红旗炉；重庆钢铁公司三号平炉，被评为全国中型平炉的红旗炉；上钢三厂的平炉车间，被评为全国小型平炉的红旗单位。
