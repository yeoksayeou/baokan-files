Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd: Premier Kim Il-sung, at today's plenary meeting of the Korean Cabinet, put forward measures to provide relief to the people of South Korea, especially disaster victims. After discussion, the meeting passed a decision on providing relief to South Korean disaster victims.

The decision stated that due to the recent wind and flood disasters that swept through South Korea, the South Korean people have suffered immense misfortune and pain. According to preliminary materials published by the South Korean authorities, as of September 23, thousands of people have already lost their lives, and 800,000 disaster victims have lost their homes, household goods, and farmland, and are at a critical juncture between life and death, waiting for rescue.

The decision stated that in South Korea, floods, droughts, and other disasters are expanding every year, and natural disasters have further expanded this year, bringing serious calamities to the people. This is a result of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and the fact that the Syngman Rhee authorities have not carried out any irrigation projects or soil and water conservation.

The decision stated that today, the northern half of the Republic, due to the basic completion of rural irrigation and the successful implementation of soil and water conservation, has become a region free from natural disasters, and the people's economy and the people's lives have been rapidly developing and improving on a solid foundation.

The decision stated that the Cabinet of the Republic expresses deep sympathy for the serious disasters suffered by the South Korean people today, and believes that providing them with material assistance as soon as possible is an obligation of noble fraternal love. To this end, the Cabinet, representing the will of all the Korean people, has decided to first provide 30,000 석 of rice, 1 million yards of cloth, 100,000 pairs of shoes, 100,000 bags of cement, and 5,000 cubic meters of timber to relieve the wind and flood disaster victims in South Korea.

The decision stated that in order to implement the relief measures for South Korean disaster victims as soon as possible, it was decided to organize a committee for the relief of South Korean disaster victims, chaired by Vice-Premier Li Zhouyuan of the Cabinet.

The decision also stated that the Government of the Republic can at any time welcome South Korean disaster victims who come to the northern half of the Republic to seek survival.
  
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd: Seoul news: A typhoon struck South Korea on the 16th. According to the South Korean News Agency, this is the largest natural disaster in sixty years. According to official statistics as of the 21st, the number of disaster victims has reached 782,000. The total loss amounts to 82.752 billion 환.

    决定说，在南朝鲜，水灾、旱灾等各种灾害每年都在扩大着，今年以来自然灾害进一步扩大，给人民带来了严重的灾难。这是由于美帝国主义的侵略政策和李承晚当局没有进行任何灌溉工程和治山治水的结果。

    决定说，共和国内阁对南朝鲜人民今天所遭受的严重灾难表示深切的同情，并且认为，早日给他们以物质援助，是出自高尚的同胞爱的义务，为此，内阁代表全体朝鲜人民的意志，决定第一次首先提供大米三万石、布匹一百万码、鞋十万双、水泥十万袋、木材五千立方米，救济南朝鲜风灾、水灾灾民。
    决定说，为了早日实现对南朝鲜灾民的救济措施，决定组织以内阁副首相李周渊为委员长的救济南朝鲜灾民委员会。
    决定还说，共和国政府在任何时候都可以迎接为了求生而来共和国北半部的南朝鲜灾民。
  据新华社平壤22日电　汉城消息：16日台风袭击南朝鲜，据南朝鲜通讯社说这是六十年来最大的一次自然灾害。据到21日为止的官方统计，灾民已达七十八万二千多人。损失总共达到八百二十七亿五千二百万圜。
