    Xinhua News Agency Report:
    Basic Preparation of Autumn-Sown Wheat Seeds Completed Nationwide
    Ministry of Agriculture Requires All Regions to Conduct Seed Surplus and Shortage Adjustment and Fine Seed Selection
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the seeds required for autumn (winter) sowing across the country have been basically prepared. According to statistics, in the wheat-producing areas of the Yellow River basin and the major wheat-producing provinces and cities in the Yangtze River basin, each mu has generally prepared more than 20 jin of wheat seeds; the amount of seed retained per mu in provinces and regions such as Beijing, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Xinjiang exceeds 25 jin or 30 jin. Areas such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi generally retain between 15 jin and 20 jin per mu.
    This year, various regions started preparing for autumn (winter) sowing seeds relatively early, so the amount of seed retained is relatively large. For example, among the more than 4 billion jin of winter wheat seeds prepared by Jiangsu, Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces, the amount retained by the communes themselves accounts for 86%, while the national reserves account for only 14%. On the other hand, agricultural leadership departments at all levels also strengthened seed purchase and storage work during this year's summer harvest. According to statistics, ten provinces (including special districts and counties) such as Anhui have stored more than 1.7 billion jin of seeds, greatly increasing the country's seed reserves and ensuring necessary adjustments.
    Due to the relatively sufficient quantity of seeds retained by the communes themselves and national reserves, the amount of inter-provincial adjustment this year has significantly decreased, accounting for less than one-tenth of that in 1958.
    This year's winter wheat seeds are generally of better quality than last year's because meticulous seed selection work was widely carried out during the summer harvest. In Jiangsu and Hubei provinces, the purity of general wheat seeds is around 90%–95%, while in Shanghai, Anhui, Sichuan, and other places, it is generally between 80% and 90%. In Lushan County, Henan Province, the germination rate of wheat seeds is above 80%.
    Currently, various regions are further improving the preparation of winter wheat seeds. Because there are still imbalances in the amount of seed retained by communes in some areas, and some of the seeds that have been prepared are still of poor quality, the Party and government departments in these areas are mobilizing the masses to exchange, adjust, and conduct pre-sowing seed selection.
    Xinhua News Agency Report: The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice requiring agricultural departments in all regions to seize the opportunity to further improve the preparation of autumn (winter) sowing seeds to welcome the upcoming high tide of autumn sowing.
    The notice said that although the autumn (winter) sowing seeds in various provinces have been basically prepared, the amount of seed retained among special districts, counties, communes, and teams is still uneven, and the quality needs to be further improved. Currently, many regions are actively adjusting, exchanging, and selecting seeds, but some regions are acting relatively slowly. In order to complete the sowing task in a timely manner and meet the needs of reasonable close planting, these regions must immediately mobilize the masses to exchange with each other, and the nationally reserved seeds must also be quickly distributed to the communes.
    Regarding seed treatment, the notice requires all regions to mobilize the masses to carry out seed selection and germination tests before sowing to check and improve seed quality.
    The notice finally requires all regions to conscientiously carry out fine seed breeding work while sowing to ensure that there are enough seeds for next year. Communes that have established fine seed breeding farms (fields) or experimental breeding farms should consolidate and improve them to give full play to their role.

    全国秋播小麦种子基本备足
    农业部要求各地作好种子余缺调剂和精选良种工作
    据新华社讯　全国各地秋（冬）播种需用的种子已经基本备足。据统计：黄河流域产麦区和长江流域各个主要产麦省、市，一般每亩都准备麦种二十斤以上；北京、江苏、四川、新疆等省、区每亩留种量都超过二十五斤或三十斤，广东、广西、湖南、江西等地一般在十五斤到二十斤之间。
    今年，各地对秋（冬）播种子的准备工作抓的比较早，因此，留种数量比较多。如江苏、山东、陕西、河南、山西五省准备的四十多亿斤冬小麦种子中，公社自留的占到86％，国家储备的只占14％；另一方面，各级农业领导部门在今年夏收中还加强了种子收购贮备工作。据统计，安徽等十个省（包括专区和县）储备的种子达十七亿斤以上，大大增加国家的种子储备量，保证了必要的调剂。
    由于公社自留和国家储备种子的数量比较充足，今年省间调剂数量显著降低，还不到1958年的十分之一。
    今年冬小麦种子，由于夏收中普遍开展了细致的选种工作，种子质量一般比去年好。江苏、湖北省一般麦种纯度在90％——95％左右，上海、安徽、四川等地一般都在80％——90％之间。河南省鲁山等县，麦种发芽率都在80％以上。
    目前，各地正在进一步做好冬小麦种子准备工作。由于部分地区公社自留的种子还有不平衡现象，已经准备的种子中也还有一部分质量较差，因此，这些地区的党政部门正在发动群众进行串换、调剂和进行播种前的种子精选工作。
    新华社讯　农业部最近发出通知，要求各地农业部门抓紧时机，进一步做好秋（冬）播种子的准备工作，以迎接即将来到的秋播高潮。
    通知说，现在各省秋（冬）播种子虽然已经基本备足，但专、县、社、队之间留种数量仍不平衡，质量也需进一步提高。目前，很多地区正在积极调剂、串换和精选种子，但部分地区行动比较迟缓。为了适时完成播种任务和满足合理密植的需要，这些地区必须立即发动群众互相串换，国家储备的种子，也要迅速发到公社。
    关于种子处理工作，通知要求各地在播种前发动群众，普遍进行种子的精选和发芽试验，以检查和提高种子的质量。
    通知最后要求各地在播种同时要认真做好良种繁殖工作，以保证明年有足够数量的种子。公社已建良种繁育场（田），或试验繁殖场的，应加以整顿巩固，充分发挥作用。
