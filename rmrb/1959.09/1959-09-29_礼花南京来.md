Fireworks Come to Nanjing
Our Jiangsu Correspondent

The National Day for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is getting closer and closer, and people's moods are becoming more and more excited.

Millions of people are looking forward to that day. So many sleepless nights, so many bright mornings, people have woven flowers with wisdom and watered branches and leaves with sweat, wholeheartedly cultivating the newest and most beautiful fireworks to dedicate to this exciting and happiest moment.

Here is what the workers of Nanjing want to say.

        Forty Days and Nights

A triangular red flag flutters on a machine tool, with the words "For Exhibition in Beijing" written on it. This is an automated precision machine tool that workers at the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory are dedicating to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It can automatically retract the tool, change the tool, automatically adjust the speed, and has an automatic safety device. Even when the turret is rotating at its highest speed, it will stop immediately in the event of a failure. This lathe is called the "C350L Turret Hexagonal Lathe". In order to rush out this generous gift, the workers have fought for forty days and nights.

The night was very, very late, and the surroundings were dark and quiet, but the lights in the room where new products were being trial-produced were particularly bright. Three veteran masters, Wang Guojun, Wu Renlin, and Ding Buqing, bent over beside the machine tool, sometimes disassembling and studying it, sometimes test-driving it, but most of the time they were frowning and thinking hard. They didn't know what fatigue was. As long as they thought of Beijing and mentioned the dedication gift, they felt full of energy.

Trial-producing a new product is like the rolling waves of the Yangtze River, one passing and another appearing. After solving the problem of the belt bearing overheating, the problem of the automatic feeding of materials in the headstock appeared again. The material was always not clamped tightly when it was clamped in, and it could not be loosened when it was clamped tightly. The ground was covered with chalk drawings, and everyone was studying. Wang Guojun kept thinking, if a spring sheet is added, can it not automatically vibrate, automatically clamp, and automatically release? Sure enough, this method finally succeeded.

Every time they overcame a difficulty, every time they moved forward, everyone's heart became closer to Beijing. Forty days and nights of tension, anxiety, failure, and victory all turned into indescribable happiness.

Now, this lathe, which has reached the international level, has been shipped to Beijing.

        Magnified 20,000 Times

A few days ago, the mood of Engineer Wei Jinjun of the Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory was becoming more and more anxious.

Since Wei Jinjun and his assistants proposed to the factory the plan to "complete the advanced electron microscope ahead of schedule and dedicate it to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China," they had conducted more than 20 experiments in a row, but had not been able to increase the magnification from more than 7,000 times to 20,000 times. This was the last hurdle for the electron microscope.

He thought that the reason why the magnification did not meet the requirements may be that there was a problem with the focal length of each lens. If the current of the lens is increased to shorten its focal length, so that the image formed by the objective lens and the intermediate lens reaches a reasonable position, can it not magnify?

That night, late at night, in a small room, thick black curtains were hanging down, close to the window, and the four walls were dark. Although it was early autumn, the airtight studio was unusually hot. Communist Youth League member Chen Xueyan accepted the engineer's instructions to prepare. After she connected a rectified power supply, a sesame-sized bright spot appeared on the screen. Gradually, the light spot became brighter and brighter. She carefully changed the current of each lens. As the current changed, the changes in the light spot on the screen showed a phenomenon that had never been seen before. Ah, this is a sign of success! She suppressed her inner excitement and put the grating test piece into the microscope. A large and clear impression immediately appeared on the screen. After calculation, it proved that the multiple had exceeded 20,000 times.

The next morning, Chen Xueyan put a mosquito's wing in this microscope for observation. The slender hairs on the wing immediately appeared as thick as fingers, and even the black spots at the tips of the hairs could be seen clearly. If the mosquito's wing is placed under an optical microscope with a magnification of 1,500 times, the hairs can only vaguely show black spots as small as needle tips. Fingers and needle tips, this is the evidence of the leap forward in China's scientific level.

The last hurdle was overcome, and the advanced electron microscope was finally successfully manufactured 20 days ahead of schedule.

        Shorten the Time as Much as Possible

At the foot of the mountain on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the steel warriors of the Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant are working hard around Blast Furnace No. 2. In order to celebrate the glorious 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, they are determined to express the wishes of the steelworkers to the motherland with the most outstanding achievements.

The blower keeps rotating and roaring. Trains transporting iron ingots and iron slag spew out plumes of black smoke and emit long whistles. Cars shuttling back and forth unloaded large quantities of ore and coke, which were continuously sent to the blast furnace hopper through belt conveyors.

In the tapping yard, the furnace workers have made all the preparations. Just like hunters setting up their guns to guard against beasts, they watch the furnace mouth eagerly, solemnly and excitedly. The signal bell for tapping rang, and the fiery red molten iron rushed out of the furnace door, illuminating the area in front of the furnace.

Comrade Lu Changshan, who is in charge of the slag skimmer on the furnace platform, this tall, red-faced young man, was a handyman in a military school last year, but today he has become a skilled furnace worker. More than a month ago, before Blast Furnace No. 2 was officially put into production, Lu Changshan braved the high temperature of 70°C and entered the furnace hearth, insisting on working inside for several hours. The blast furnace went into production on time. Young men like him, full of vigor, can be seen everywhere in Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant. In less than two months after Blast Furnace No. 2 was put into production, the daily output has been increasing steadily. Since September, it has broken through the mark of 300 tons of pig iron per day. Now, the employees have set higher requirements for themselves, to shorten the tapping time as much as possible and dedicate themselves to the great National Day celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

    礼花南京来
    本报驻江苏记者
    离开建国十周年的节日越来越近了，人们的心情也越来越兴奋了。
    千千万万的人都在向往着那一天。多少个不眠的夜晚，多少个明朗的早晨，人们用智慧编织着花朵，用汗水浇灌着枝叶，一心要培植一朵最新最美的礼花，献给这激动人心的最幸福的时刻。
    这里写下的是南京市工人们的心愿。
          四十个昼夜
    一面三角红旗在机床上飘扬，旗上写着“去北京展出”。这是南京机床厂工人向建国十周年献礼的一台自动化的精密机床，它可以自动退刀、换刀、自动调整车速，还有自动的安全装置，即便是在车头转到最高速度时，一旦发生故障，就会立即停下来。这台车床名字叫“C350L型转塔式六角车床”。为了赶制这份厚礼，工人们已经奋战了四十个昼夜。
    夜，已经很深很深，四周黑漆漆、静悄悄的，而试造新产品的房间里却是灯光分外明亮，王国钧、吴仁林、丁步青三个老师傅，弯着腰在机床旁边，一忽儿拆装研究，一忽儿开车试验，但大部分时间他们都是紧绉着眉头，在苦苦思索。他们不知什么是疲劳，只要是一想起北京，一提起献礼，就觉得浑身是劲。
    试制一台新产品，就像长江滚滚翻浪，一个过去，一个又出现。解决了皮带轴承发热问题，又出现了主轴箱自动送夹料问题。材料夹进去总夹不紧，夹紧了又松不开。地上画满了粉笔画，大伙儿在研究，王国钧却一个劲地在想，如果增加一个弹簧片，不就可以自动振动，自动夹紧，自动松开吗？果然，采用这个办法终于成功了。
    每战胜一个困难，每向前走一步，每个人的心就和北京贴得越紧，四十个昼夜的紧张、焦虑、失败和胜利，都变成难以言状的幸福。
    现在，这台达到国际水平的车床已经运到北京。
            放大二万倍
    前几天，南京教学仪器厂韦锦钧工程师的心情愈来愈焦急了。
    韦锦钧和他的助手们自从向全厂提出“提前制成高级电子显微镜，向建国十周年献礼”的计划后接连经过二十多次试验，都没有把放大倍率从七千多倍提高到二万倍。这是电子显微镜的最后一个难关。
    他想，放大倍率达不到要求的原因，可能是各个透镜的焦距有问题。如果增大透镜的电流，缩短它的焦距，使物镜与中间透镜所成的像达到合理位置，那不就能使它起放大作用吗？
    当天晚上，夜深人静，在一间斗室内，厚厚的黑布幕垂放着，紧贴窗前，四壁黑糊糊地，虽是初秋天气，这间密不通风的工作室内却闷热异常。共青团员陈雪雁接受工程师的嘱咐在做准备工作。在她接了一个通过整流的电源后，光屏上出现了芝麻大的明亮光点，渐渐地光点愈来愈明亮，她小心地改变每个透镜电流，随着电流的变化，光屏上的光点变化出现了过去所没有过的现象。啊，这是成功的预兆！她压抑住内心的激动，把光栅试片放入显微镜中，光屏上顿时显出很大并且清晰的印象，经过计算，证明倍数已经超过了两万倍。
    第二天早晨，陈雪雁把一只蚊子翅膀放在这台显微镜中观察，翅膀上一根根纤密的茸毛，立刻显得有手指头那么粗大，连茸毛尖端的一粒粒黑点，也看得清清楚楚。如果把蚊子翅膀放在一千五百倍的光学显微镜下，茸毛只能模糊地显出针尖那样大小的黑点，手指与针尖，这就是我国科学水平飞跃前进的见证。
    最后一个难关突破了，高级电子显微镜终于提前二十天胜利地制成。
          尽量缩短时间
    在长江北岸的山脚下，南京钢铁厂的钢铁战士们正围着二号高炉紧张地工作着。为了庆祝光荣的建国十周年，他们决心以最出色的成绩，向祖国表一表钢铁工人的心意。
    鼓风机不停地旋转、轰鸣。装运铁锭和铁渣的火车，喷出股股黑烟，发出一声声长啸。往来如梭的汽 车卸下了一大批一大批的矿石和焦炭，经过皮带运输机源源不断地送进了高炉料槽。
    出铁场里，炉前工们已经做好了一切准备工作。就好像猎人架好了枪守候野兽一样，热切地注视着炉口，严肃而又兴奋。出铁的信号铃响了，火红火红的铁水冲出了炉门，照得炉前一片通亮。
    在炉台上负责避渣器工作的吕长山同志，这个高个子红脸膛的小伙子，去年还是军事学校的一个勤杂工，而今天，已经成为一个熟练的炉前工人。早在一个多月以前，二号高炉还没有正式投入生产的时候，吕长山就冒着70℃的高温，进入了炉缸，在里边坚持工作达数小时。高炉按时生产了。像他这样生龙活虎的小伙子，在南钢到处都可以看到。二号高炉投入生产不到两个月，日产量步步上升。9月以来，已经突破了日产生铁三百吨的大关。现在，职工们又对自己提出了更高的要求，要尽量缩短出铁时间，向伟大的建国十周年大典献礼！（附图片）
