Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: The Dingling Museum at the Ming Tombs in Beijing has been completed and will open on the 26th.

Dingling is one of the larger mausoleums in the Ming Tombs, built in 1584, and the project was quite massive. The tomb contains the remains of Zhu Yijun, the thirteenth emperor of the Ming Dynasty, and his two empresses, Xiaorui and Xiaojing. To allow people across the country to witness the extravagance and excess of feudal emperors, the squandering of resources, and to reflect the wisdom and creativity of our working people, and to provide archaeologists and historians with more material data, the excavation of Dingling began in May 1956. After more than three years of hard work by the workers, a museum has finally been built.

The entire structure of Dingling, in addition to the ground-level Ling'en Gate, Ling'en Hall (destroyed by fire in 1914), Ming Tower, and the Precious Enclosure surrounding the mausoleum, also includes a massive underground tomb chamber, the so-called "Underground Palace." The Dingling Museum now exhibits two main parts: one part is the original "Underground Palace," where people can see another great achievement of our country's architecture more than 330 years ago, as well as all the furnishings in the mausoleums of feudal emperors and empresses; the other part is the various burial objects excavated from the mausoleum.

To facilitate visits, a flat path has been opened behind the Ming Tower of Dingling, and a five-story spiral staircase made of reinforced concrete has been built, leading directly to the entrance of the "Underground Palace." Bright electric lights have been installed inside the "Underground Palace."

The two newly built exhibition rooms on both sides of the Ming Tower display various cultural relics excavated from the "Underground Palace." The exhibition rooms also contain models of the Dingling tunnel, various charts, and photographs, etc., to help visitors understand the detailed process of the Dingling excavation, the geographical environment, and the historical overview.

In the central hall of the Underground Palace, there are three thrones. The central one is the throne for the emperor's spirit, and the two on the sides are for the empresses' spirits. In front of the thrones are incense burners, candlesticks, and eternal lamps. (Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    定陵博物馆今起开放
    展出“地下宫殿”和各种随葬品
    新华社25日讯　首都明十三陵的定陵博物馆已经修建完毕，定26日开放。
    定陵是明十三陵中比较大的一个陵墓，修建于1584年，工程相当浩大。墓中曾经埋葬着明代第十三个皇帝朱翊钧和孝瑞、孝靖两个皇后。为了让全国人民目睹封建帝王穷奢极欲，挥霍无度的情景，反映我国劳动人民的智慧和创造，为考古家和历史学者提供更多的实物资料，定陵发掘工作从1956年5月便开始了，经过工人们三年多的艰苦努力，终于修建成了一所博物馆。
    定陵的全部建筑，除地面上的棱恩门、棱恩殿（在1914年被大火烧毁）、明楼和陵墓外围的宝城外，还有一个规模巨大的地下墓穴，即所谓“地下宫殿”。现在修建成的定陵博物馆，展出内容主要分两部分：一部分是原来的“地下宫殿”，人们可以从这里看到三百三十多年前我们祖国在建筑上的又一巨大成就，以及封建帝后陵墓中的一切陈设，另一部分是从陵墓里发掘出来的各种各样的随葬品。
    为了便利游人参观，在定陵的明楼后边，开了一条平道，用钢筋水泥修建了五层盘旋式的扶梯，直通“地下宫殿”的进口。“地下宫殿”内安装了明亮的电灯。
    明楼两旁新建的两个展览室里，展出了从“地下宫殿”发掘出来的各种文物。展览室里还摆着定陵隧道模型、各种图表和照片等等，便于观众了解发掘定陵的详细过程和地理环境，历史概况等。（附图片）
