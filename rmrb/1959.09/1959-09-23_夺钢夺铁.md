　　Anshan Iron and Steel overproduced more than 38,700 tons of steel; Daye Steel Plant fully completed the third quarter plan; Heilongjiang completed the third quarter pig iron plan ahead of schedule; Guizhou overfulfilled the steelmaking plan by more than 300 tons; Henan overfulfilled the pig iron plan by 12%
　　Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd – The Anshan Iron and Steel rolling army has achieved another major production victory, overfulfilling the state steel production plan for the third quarter twelve days ahead of schedule. As of the 21st, they had overproduced more than 38,700 tons of steel. Now, the rolling workers are seizing the last few days of September to fight for the goal of increasing production of 150,000 tons of high-quality steel in the third quarter.
　　Since the third quarter, under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's thirteen rolling mills have continuously criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres and continuously boosted their revolutionary spirit. Therefore, under the unfavorable conditions of major repairs in six rolling mills and hot weather, production has been rising wave after wave. In early July, some rolling mills did not complete their production plans well because some cadres developed a relaxed and fearful attitude. Since mid-July, after mobilizing the masses, criticizing the relaxed mood, focusing on equipment maintenance and repair and the production of spare parts, and launching extensive competitions among workers, the production situation quickly improved, and finally, more than 40,000 tons of steel were overproduced to complete the monthly plan. Since August, the workers of each factory have continued to criticize the new relaxed mood of a few cadres due to the high output in July, further boosting their energy, and on August 4, they proposed to increase steel production by 100,000 tons in the third quarter to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. In order to achieve this goal, the leading cadres of each factory have gone deep into the front line to organize workers to solve key production problems. As a result, by the 20th, they had completed more than 70% of the production plan. As new production potential was continuously tapped, on the 24th, the workers proposed to achieve the original target of increasing steel production by 100,000 tons one month ahead of schedule. After the heroic struggle of the workers, by August 31, more than 118,000 tons of steel had been increased, realizing their initiative plan more than a month ahead of schedule. Steel production in August increased by more than 9% compared with July, continuing to create high production records. Continuous victories have made the workers realize the great significance of anti-rightism and boosting energy, and their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. On the 10th of this month, a fighting target of increasing steel production by 32,000 tons in September and 150,000 tons in the entire season was put forward. After the hard work and ingenuity of the workers, under the condition of major repairs in two factories, more than 13,000 tons of steel were increased in the first twenty-one days of September, thus ensuring the completion of the third quarter steel production plan ahead of schedule.
　　On the basis of anti-rightism and boosting energy, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's rolling mills have also extensively and deeply carried out production increase and economy campaigns in the third quarter, carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, thereby overcoming the weak links in production and improving production efficiency. In the recent technical performance competition, the workers of the First Primary Rolling Mill proposed more than 350 technical innovations, which doubled the production efficiency. Because this factory mobilized workers to continuously innovate technology and learn advanced technical experience in various forms of production increase and economy campaigns, it overfulfilled the steel billet production plan every month in the third quarter and continuously created new records in steel billet production, creating favorable conditions for each rolling mill to complete the production plan. Since August, the workers of the First Thin Plate Mill have achieved more than 20 relatively important technical innovations. After the promotion of the new steel rolling method created by the workers of Class A of the steel rolling section, the steel rolling efficiency has increased by about 20%. The workers of the First Medium Plate Mill, which has overfulfilled the state plan every month since the third quarter, found in the production increase and economy competition that the capacity of the water pump in the water pump room could not meet the needs of production growth. Therefore, the technicians and workers improved the problem of the too thin water outlet and inlet pipes and expanded the water outlet and inlet capacity. As a result, the heating furnace had enough circulating water to use without increasing the water pump, which guaranteed the improvement of steel rolling production. Because the workers of this factory continuously promoted a series of advanced experiences such as rapid steel burning, rapid steel rolling, rapid ingot rolling, and rapid maintenance, they increased the production of more than 8,400 tons of high-quality steel plates for the country from July 1 to September 21.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd – The Rolling Department of Daye Steel Plant completed the third quarter steel production plan in an all-round way ten days ahead of schedule. It is estimated that the steel output in the whole season will increase by 23% compared with the second quarter.
　　The leading cadres, technicians, and workers of the three rolling workshops under the Rolling Department of Daye Steel Plant have recently worked hard day and night to continuously overcome more than 30 key production problems, making production leap forward. With the assistance of the steelmaking workshop, the First Rolling Workshop implemented hot-charging steel ingots and rapid heating methods in the heating furnace, which shortened the heating time of steel ingots by one and a half hours, basically solving the problem that the capacity of the heating furnace could not keep up with the needs of the primary rolling mill, greatly improving the production capacity of the primary rolling mill. The Second Workshop also took measures to roll one more steel each time with the medium and small roughing mills, and the production efficiency increased by half and one time respectively.
　　Under the slogan of "Each shift contributes to the National Day, everyone contributes to the National Day," the workers of the three rolling workshops launched a heated opponent competition and technical performance competition. In the competition, the original backward production became advanced, and the communist spirit of cooperation among workers was greatly strengthened. Class C of the First Workshop and Class B of the medium-sized rolling mill of the Second Workshop used to lag behind in production. Recently, the workers of the two classes have mustered up their energy, strengthened the core of the class group, and actively improved their technology, chasing the advanced class groups. Since September, the production of these two rolling shifts has always been at the forefront. In mid-September, Class C of the First Workshop also created the highest record since the start of production with 528 tons and 606 tons of class output twice.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 21st – Heilongjiang Province completed the third quarter pig iron production plan twenty-one days ahead of schedule. The average qualified rate of pig iron reached 90%, the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces increased by 11% compared with August, and the cost and coke ratio were significantly reduced. The workers of each iron smelting plant in the province are advancing victoriously, striving to increase the production of 6,000 tons of pig iron by the end of September to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.
　　In Heilongjiang Province, which did not produce an inch of iron before last year, a mass movement to produce iron and steel in 1958 established the iron smelting industry and cultivated a group of technical talents. This year, the iron smelting industry has continuously improved its production level. For example, a 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace in the iron smelting workshop of the Second Machine Tool Plant in Qiqihar now produces an average of 13 tons of pig iron per day, with a utilization coefficient of 1.008 and a coke ratio reduced to 1.1 tons. A 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace in the iron smelting workshop of the Jixi Coal Mine Machinery Plant has a maximum daily output of 15 tons.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 22nd – Guizhou Province completed the steelmaking plan for September thirteen days ahead of schedule with an excess of 320 tons. Steel production increased by nearly 100% compared with the same period in August. The qualified rate of steel ingots increased by more than 20% compared with August.
　　The workers on the iron and steel front in Guizhou Province, after issuing the heroic oath of "Completing the annual steel production plan two and a half months ahead of schedule to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country" at the beginning of the month, universally launched opponent competitions and set off a high tide of steel production. Aiming at the weak links in production, they attacked technical barriers. They tried every means to extend the life of the furnace, shorten the blowing time, and ensure that the high-sulfur and high-phosphorus local iron furnaces were blown into steel. The workers of the steelmaking workshop of Guiyang Mining Machinery Plant, due to carefully mastering the surface blowing operation during blowing, adjusting the air volume and air pressure in a timely manner, controlling slag spraying, and swinging the furnace according to the flame length, greatly reduced the corrosion of the furnace lining and tuyeres, so that the converter furnace life increased from 15 or 16 furnaces in August to 40 furnaces. The steelmaking workshop of Guizhou Automobile Manufacturing Plant, after changing the single fan to a double fan hot air melting, overcame the problem of disconnection between melting and blowing, so that the daily output of steel increased by 46% compared with August. In order to make high-sulfur and high-phosphorus local iron into qualified steel, all steelmaking units in the province universally changed acid and neutral furnaces to alkaline furnaces.
　　In addition, the workers paid attention to reducing the consumption of raw materials. In September, the iron consumption per ton of steel decreased from 2.013 tons in August to 1.75 tons, and the consumption of ferromanganese, ferrosilicon, and coke decreased, thereby reducing costs.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd – Henan Province overfulfilled the pig iron production plan for the first and middle ten days of the month by 12%. The average daily output of pig iron increased by 65% compared with August; the average daily output of steel also increased by 103% compared with August.
　　Since the beginning of September, each iron and steel plant has conscientiously promoted the twelve small blast furnace high-yield experiences centered on roasting ore, using quicklime as a flux, and multi-nozzle combustion, so that the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has been universally improved. The utilization coefficient of the small blast furnaces in the six main iron and steel plants has all reached above one. Among them, the four 13-cubic-meter small blast furnaces of the Second Iron and Steel Plant in Xinxiang City produced 91.612 tons of pig iron on the 13th, with an average utilization coefficient of 1.767 and a qualified rate of pig iron reaching 98.5%. On the 18th, the utilization coefficient of a 255-cubic-meter blast furnace of Anyang Iron and Steel Company also reached 1.13, and the qualified rate of pig iron was 100%.
　　Entering September, the iron and steel plants in Henan Province, on the one hand, seized the supporting of steelmaking equipment, so that the number of steelmaking units put into production increased from six in August to thirteen; on the other hand, they actively took measures to break through the technical barrier of steelmaking, so that the utilization coefficient of converters also greatly increased compared with August. The life of converter and iron melting furnace lining has also been extended compared with the past. For example, the converter life of the steelmaking workshop of Anyang General Machinery Plant reached 45 furnace times, the converter life of Anyang Iron and Steel Company was generally more than 25 times, and the iron melting furnace of Xinxiang Xinsheng Iron and Steel Plant had been producing continuously for 67 hours. All these not only guaranteed the rapid improvement of current production, but also laid a good foundation for continued leap forward in the future. Now, the workers of iron and steel plants throughout the province are mustering greater energy and determined to contribute to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with new achievements in completing the iron and steel production plan for this month ahead of schedule.

    夺钢夺铁　连战连捷
    鞍钢超产钢材三万八千七百多吨；大冶钢厂全面完成三季度计划；黑龙江提前完成三季度生铁计划；贵州超额三百多吨完成炼钢计划；河南超额12％完成生铁计划
    新华社鞍山22日电　鞍钢轧钢大军又获得生产大捷，提前十二天超额完成了第三季度国家钢材生产计划，到21日已超产钢材三万八千七百多吨。现在轧钢的职工们正在抓紧9月的最后几天，为实现第三季度增产十五万吨优质钢材的目标奋战着。
    第三季度以来，鞍钢十三个轧钢厂的职工在中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委的领导下，不断地批判了部分干部的右倾保守思想，不断地鼓起了革命干劲，因而在六个轧钢厂进行大修和天气酷热等不利条件下，生产一浪高过一浪。7月初，有些轧钢厂由于部分干部产生了松劲畏难情绪，生产计划完成得不够好；中旬以来，各厂经过发动职工群众，批判了松劲情绪，狠抓设备维护检修和备品备件的生产，发动职工深入开展竞赛，因而生产情况迅速好转，终于超产四万多吨钢材完成了月度计划。8月份以来，各厂职工继续批判了少数干部因7月份高产而产生的新的松劲情绪，进一步鼓足干劲，并且在8月4日提出了第三季度增产十万吨钢材向建国十周年献礼的倡议。为了实现这一奋斗目标，各厂领导干部都纷纷深入现场，组织职工解决生产关键问题，结果到20日就已完成生产计划70％以上。随着新的生产潜力不断挖掘出来，24日职工们又提出了提前一个月实现原来提出的增产十万吨钢材的指标；经过职工们英勇奋战，到8月31日已增产钢材十一万八千多吨，提前一个多月实现了他们的倡议计划。8月份钢材产量又比7月份提高9％以上，继续创造高产纪录。连战连捷，更使职工们认识到反右倾、鼓干劲的伟大意义，生产热情更加高昂。本月10日，又提出了9月份增产钢材三万二千吨、全季增产钢材十五万吨的战斗指标。经过职工们苦干巧干，在两个厂大修的情况下，9月头二十一天就增产钢材一万三千多吨，从而保证提前完成了第三季度钢材生产计划。
    鞍钢各轧钢厂的职工在反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，第三季度以来还广泛深入地开展了增产节约竞赛，大搞技术革新和技术革命，从而克服了生产中的薄弱环节，提高了生产效率。第一初轧厂职工仅仅在最近一个时期的技术表演赛中，就提出技术革新三百五十多项，使生产效率成倍提高。这个厂由于发动职工在各种形式的增产节约竞赛中，不断地革新技术和学习先进技术经验，第三季度以来月月都超额完成钢坯生产计划，并且连创钢坯生产新纪录，给各轧钢厂完成生产计划创造了有利条件。第一薄板厂职工8月份以来，共实现了比较重要的技术革新二十多项，其中轧钢工段甲班工人创造的新的轧钢方法推广以后，就提高轧钢效率20％左右。第三季度以来，月月超额完成国家计划的第一中板厂职工，在增产节约竞赛中，发现水泵房水泵的能力不能满足生产增长的需要，于是技术人员同工人一起改进了出水进水管道太细的毛病，扩大了出水进水能力，结果在不增加水泵的情况下使加热炉有足够的循环水使用，保证了轧钢生产的提高。这个厂职工由于不断推广快速烧钢、快速轧钢、快速灌轧辊、快速检修等一系列先进经验，7月1日到9月21日，共给国家增产八千四百多吨优质钢板。
    新华社武汉22日电　大冶钢厂轧钢部提前十天全面完成第三季度钢材生产计划。预计全季钢材产量将比第二季度增长23％。
    大冶钢厂轧钢部所属三个轧钢车间的领导干部、技术人员和工人，最近在一起日夜苦战，连续攻破了三十多个生产关键问题，使生产节节跃进。轧钢一车间在炼钢车间的协助下，在加热炉实行热装钢锭和快速加热办法，使钢锭加热时间缩短一个半小时，基本上解决了加热炉能力赶不上初轧机需要的问题，大大发挥了初轧机的生产能力。二车间也采取措施，使中小型毛轧机每次多轧一条钢，生产效率分别提高半倍和一倍。
    在“班班向国庆献礼，人人向国庆献礼”的口号下，三个轧钢车间职工开展了热火朝天的对手赛和技术表演赛。竞赛中，原来生产上比较落后的变为先进，职工中的共产主义协作思想也大大加强。一车间的丙班和二车间中型轧钢机的乙班过去生产总是落在后面，最近，两个班的职工都鼓足了干劲，加强了班组核心，积极提高技术，直追先进班组。9月以来，这两个轧钢班生产始终走在前面；一车间丙班在9月中旬还连创班产五百二十八吨、六百零六吨两次开工以来的最高纪录。
    新华社哈尔滨21日电　黑龙江省提前二十一天完成了第三季度的生铁生产计划。生铁合格率平均达到90％，小高炉利用系数比8月份提高11％，成本和焦比都有显著降低。全省各炼铁厂职工正乘胜前进，争取到9月末再增产六千吨生铁，向建国十周年献礼。
    在去年以前还寸铁不产的黑龙江省，经过1958年大炼钢铁的群众运动，已建立起了炼铁工业，培养出了一批技术人才。今年，炼铁工业不断提高了生产水平。如齐齐哈尔第二机床厂炼铁车间一座十三立方米的小高炉，现在平均日产生铁十三吨，利用系数达到一点零零八，焦比降低到一点一吨。鸡西煤矿机械厂炼铁车间一座十三立方米的小高炉，日产最量高达到了十五吨。
    新华社贵阳22日电　贵州省提前十三天超额三百二十吨完成了9月份炼钢计划。钢产量比8月同期增长将近一倍。钢锭合格率比8月提高20％以上。
    贵州省钢铁战线上的职工，在月初发出“提前两个半月完成全年产钢计划，向建国十周年献礼”的豪迈誓言后，普遍开展对手竞赛，掀起夺钢生产高潮，针对生产中的薄弱环节，猛攻技术关。他们千方百计地延长炉子寿命，缩短吹炼时间，保证高硫高磷的土铁炉炉吹炼成钢。贵阳矿山机器厂炼钢车间职工，由于吹炼时认真掌握了面吹操作，适时调整风量、风压，控制喷渣，根据火焰长短摇炉，大大减轻了炉衬和风眼的腐蚀程度，使转炉炉龄由8月份的十五、六炉上升到四十炉。贵州省汽车制造厂炼钢车间，在改单风机为双风机热风熔化后，克服了熔化与吹炼脱节的毛病，使钢的日产量比8月份提高了46％。为了使高硫高磷土铁炼成合格钢，全省各炼钢单位普遍把酸性和中性炉改为碱性炉。
    此外，职工们注意降低原料材料的消耗，9月份每吨钢的铁耗由8月份的二·零一三吨下降到一·七五吨，锰铁、矽铁和焦炭的用量都下降，从而降低了成本。
    新华社郑州22日电　河南省超额12％完成了上中两旬的生铁生产计划，生铁的平均日产量较8月份提高65％；钢的平均日产量也比8月份提高103％。
    从9月初以来，各钢铁厂认真地推广了以焙烧矿石、生石灰作熔剂、多咀燃烧等为中心的十二项小高炉丰产经验，使高炉利用系数普遍提高，六个主要钢铁厂的小高炉的利用系数全部达到了一以上。其中新乡市第二钢铁厂四座十三立方米的小高炉，13日生产生铁九十一点六一二吨，利用系数平均为一点七六七，生铁合格率也达到98.5％。安阳钢铁公司的一座二百五十五立方米高炉，18日利用系数也达到一点一三，生铁合格率为100％。
    进入9月份，河南全省钢铁厂一方面抓紧炼钢设备的配套，使投入生产的炼钢单位由8月份的六个增加到十三个；另一方面，积极采取措施突破炼钢技术关，使转炉的利用系数也较8月份大大提高。转炉和化铁炉炉衬的寿命也比过去延长了。像安阳市通用机器厂炼钢车间的转炉寿命达到四十五炉次，安阳钢铁公司的转炉寿命普遍在二十五次以上，新乡市新生钢铁厂化铁炉曾连续生产六十七小时。所有这些，不仅保证了当前生产迅速提高，而且为今后继续跃进打下了良好基础。现在，全省钢铁厂的职工正鼓足更大干劲，决心用提前超额完成本月钢铁生产计划的新成就向伟大的建国十周年献礼。（附图片）
