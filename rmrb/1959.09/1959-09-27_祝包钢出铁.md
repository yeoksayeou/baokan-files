Congratulations on Baogang's iron smelting!

Baogang has started smelting iron!

Following Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, China's third large-scale iron and steel complex has joined the battle. The No. 1 blast furnace of Baogang, which has been put into operation this time, is one of the largest automated blast furnaces in China. It adopts world-class technology and equipment, with an effective volume of 1,513 cubic meters and a designed annual output of 900,000 tons. After normal production, it can produce an average of 2,500 tons of pig iron per day. We warmly congratulate this powerful new force of iron smelting on entering the iron and steel front, and pay our highest respects to the workers of all ethnic groups who built Baogang, to the people from all over the country who supported the construction of Baogang, and to the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries that helped build Baogang!

Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace was built ahead of schedule under the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year. It is a product of the Great Leap Forward. According to the original plan, this blast furnace would be completed on National Day in 1960. Last year, in the vigorous Great Leap Forward, the workers of Baogang were full of energy and determined to complete the construction one year ahead of schedule, striving to produce iron as soon as possible and present a gift to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Encouraged by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee, this ambition has now been fully realized. It is not easy to complete such a large-scale and technically complex project as Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace one year ahead of schedule. The total amount of equipment required for Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace and related coking, water source, and mining projects alone reached 26,000 tons. In addition to about 10% of the important equipment being supplied by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the rest needed to be solved through the cooperation of hundreds of factories in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country. The completion of Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace project one year ahead of schedule means that the workers of Baogang accelerated the construction speed by one year, and the workers of these hundreds of factories also accelerated the speed by one year. What a arduous task this is! If it were not for the Great Leap Forward, if it were not for holding high the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, no one would have dared to imagine that such a major task could be accomplished in such a short period of time. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, thousands of workers, engineers, technicians and managers who built Baogang and supported the construction of Baogang practiced their vows, and the project originally scheduled to be completed in 1960 was completed in 1959. The splendor of Baogang has been added to the colorful fireworks celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is a victory of the mass steelmaking campaign launched since last year in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction and the guidelines, policies, and working methods that embody the general line!

Baogang's iron smelting is good news for the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and even more so for the people of Inner Mongolia. Inner Mongolia is not only a fertile pasture for the motherland, but also rich in mineral resources. For many years, the people of Inner Mongolia have passed down a legend about an "Iron Cabinet Mountain" on the grasslands that contains thousands of treasures. People have hoped to forge a key to open the "Iron Cabinet Mountain" for generations, but have never succeeded. Inner Mongolia, rich in mineral resources, is still a grassland lacking industry. Only after liberation, in the socialist family of unity and friendship among all ethnic groups, was this key successfully forged. The construction of Baogang opened the door to the "Iron Cabinet Mountain." The iron smelting of its No. 1 blast furnace is the first time that the thousands of treasures hidden deep in the mountains have shone brightly. From now on, Inner Mongolia will not only produce fur, but also pig iron, and soon steel, steel products, and various other industrial products. Inner Mongolia will not only be a huge animal husbandry base for the motherland, but also a huge iron and steel base for the motherland. The first batch of industrial workers of the Mongolian nationality has grown up with the development of Baogang's construction. The historical imbalance in economic development among ethnic minority areas will be further eliminated. Therefore, the construction of Baogang is not only of great significance to the development of the iron and steel industry, but also of great significance to strengthening national unity and building a socialist family for all ethnic groups.

At the time when Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace was put into production, millions of troops on the national iron and steel front were opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting their energy, and carrying out a vigorous production competition movement in order to complete the production target of 12 million tons of steel ahead of schedule. We hope that the workers of Baogang will build on the victory of putting the No. 1 blast furnace into production ahead of schedule, make persistent efforts, and strive to achieve the designed level of production of the No. 1 blast furnace as soon as possible, and strive to produce steel and steel products as soon as possible!

    祝包钢出铁
    包钢出铁了！
    继鞍钢、武钢之后，我国第三个大型钢铁联合企业参战了。这次投入生产的包钢一号高炉，是我国目前最大的自动化大型高炉之一。它采用世界上第一流的技术装备，有效容积达一千五百一十三立方米，设计年产量九十万吨，生产正常以后，平均每天可以出二千五百吨生铁。我们热烈地祝贺这支强大的炼铁生力军进入钢铁战线，并向建设包钢的各民族职工，向全国各地支援包钢建设的人们，向帮助包钢建设的苏联和其他兄弟国家致以崇高的敬意！
    包钢一号高炉是在去年大跃进的形势下提前建设的。它是大跃进的产物。根据原来的计划，这座高炉将在1960年国庆节建成。去年，在轰轰烈烈的大跃进中，包钢职工干劲冲天，决心提前一年建成，力争早日出铁，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。在党的八中全会伟大号召鼓舞下，这个雄心如今完全实现了。像包钢一号高炉这样一个规模巨大、技术复杂的工程，提前一年建成，是一件很不容易的事情。单是包钢一号高炉和与其有关的焦化、水源、矿山等工程所需要的设备总量即达二万六千吨，其中除了10％左右的重要设备由苏联等社会主义国家供给外，其余的需要全国二十多个省市的数百个工厂协作解决。包钢一号高炉工程提前一年建成，意味着包钢的职工把建设的速度加快一年，而且这几百个工厂的职工也把速度加快了一年。这是一个何等艰巨的任务！如果不是大跃进，如果不是高举鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省建设社会主义的总路线旗帜，谁也不敢设想会在这样短的时间内，实现这样重大的任务。在党的领导和全国人民支持下，建设包钢和支援包钢建设的千千万万工人、工程技术人员和管理人员实践了自己的誓言，原来安排在1960年完成的工程在1959年完成了。庆祝建国十周年的万紫千红的礼花中增添了包钢的一分光辉。这是去年以来根据党的社会主义建设总路线和体现总路线的方针、政策、工作方法所开展的大炼钢铁群众运动的胜利！
    包钢出铁，是全国各族人民的喜讯，更是内蒙古人民的喜讯。内蒙古不但是祖国肥美的牧场，而且蕴藏着丰富的矿产资源。多少年来，内蒙人民相传在草原上有一座藏有千珍万宝的“铁柜山”。人们世世代代希望铸造一把打开“铁柜山”的钥匙，但是一直不能成功。矿藏丰富的内蒙古依然是一块缺少工业的草原。只有在解放以后，在各民族团结友爱的社会主义大家庭里，这把钥匙才铸造成功了。包钢的建设，打开了“铁柜山”的大门，它的一号高炉的出铁，是久藏深山的千珍万宝首次大放光彩。从此，内蒙古不但出产皮毛，而且出产生铁，紧接着还将出钢、钢材和其他各种工业产品。内蒙古不但是祖国巨大的畜牧基地，而且将是祖国巨大的钢铁基地。蒙古民族的第一批产业工人队伍已经随着包钢建设的发展成长起来。历史上遗留下来的各民族地区经济上的发展不平衡现象将进一步得到消除。因此，包钢的建设不仅对于钢铁工业的发展有着重大的意义，而且对于增强民族团结、对于建设各民族的社会主义大家庭也有着重大的意义。
    包钢一号高炉投入生产的时候，正是全国钢铁战线上几百万大军反右倾、鼓干劲，为提前完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务，开展气势磅礴的生产竞赛运动的时候，我们希望包钢职工在一号高炉提前投入生产的胜利基础上再接再厉，力争一号高炉的生产早日达到设计水平，力争早日出钢，早日出钢材！
