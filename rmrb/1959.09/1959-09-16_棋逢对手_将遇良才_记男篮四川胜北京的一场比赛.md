　　On the evening of the 15th, a battle between the Beijing Men's Basketball Team and the Sichuan Men's Basketball Team at the Beijing Racecourse was fiercely contested from beginning to end, holding everyone in suspense. The back-and-forth struggle, constant competition, and relentless pursuit between the two sides characterized this game, making it the most intense battle since the start of the National Games basketball competition.

　　At 9:50 PM, under the watchful eyes of nearly six thousand spectators in the capital, the players from both sides entered the court, sparking lively discussions among the audience. This was a crucial battle in determining who would take home the National Games Men's Basketball Championship. Since the start of the men's basketball competition, only Beijing and Sichuan had maintained undefeated records of five wins and zero losses. The Beijing team was a well-established, experienced powerhouse, while the Sichuan team was a rising star. As a result, the spacious racecourse was filled with a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere.

　　From the start of the game, it was clear that these two teams were heading for an unusual and dramatic battle. After the Sichuan team scored the first points, the Beijing team adopted a man-to-man defense, attempting to disrupt Sichuan's outside passing and offensive plays. The Sichuan team's center, Zhang Genquan, was closely guarded by the Beijing players, making it difficult for him to get opportunities for layups. On the other hand, the Sichuan team also adopted an active zone defense strategy, making it quite difficult for the Beijing team to break through Sichuan's strong defense. As a result, in the first five minutes, the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with the Beijing team leading 11-10. The Sichuan team proved to be a brave and tenacious squad. When the tactic of playing through the center proved ineffective, they boldly cut inside and adopted an aggressive offensive approach. The Beijing team, eager to win, committed a series of fouls. By the eighth minute, the Sichuan team began to lead by one point.

　　After falling slightly behind, the Beijing team also began to counterattack, utilizing fast breaks and combining plays involving the center and baseline cuts to regain the advantage. By the twelfth minute, the Beijing team had a lead of as many as nine points. However, as people had anticipated, even when in a very unfavorable position, the Sichuan team showed no signs of giving up. They continued to muster their courage and face the difficult situation. When they launched another fierce attack, it indeed paid off. By the end of the first half, they had narrowed the score to 35-37, trailing by only two points.

　　During the halftime break, various discussions arose in the stands. People were not speculating on the outcome of the game based on the teams' techniques or willpower because, from the first half, they had seen that both teams' players possessed considerable skill and teamwork. People had also witnessed the bravery and tenacity of both teams' players. The focus was more on how the two teams could maintain their strength to strive for the final victory. In this regard, the Beijing team was clearly at a disadvantage. Most of their key players had already committed three or four fouls. One wrong move could result in them being ejected from the game, and the Beijing team's biggest weakness was their lack of depth in the reserves.

　　At the start of the second half, the Beijing team's weakness became apparent. Due to the high number of fouls committed by their key players, they were afraid to fully exert themselves, resulting in excessive gaps in their defense. Under the Sichuan team's fierce attack, they were on the defensive. Within five minutes, the Sichuan team scored a total of eleven points through a combination of shots and free throws, while the Beijing team only managed to score one point from a free throw, creating a situation where the Beijing team trailed 38-48 by ten points. People were already starting to worry about the Beijing team. However, the Beijing team did not lose heart. After a timeout, the rookie Zhang Tairong replaced the veteran He Shisun. Introducing a rookie at such a tense moment was, of course, due to the fact that the key players had already committed too many fouls and they needed to maintain a certain level of strength, but it was also a new attempt by the coach directing the battle. After Zhang Tairong came on, he played very bravely and actively, intercepting passes in the mid-court, cutting into the basket, and scoring twice with long-range shots. The Beijing team suddenly improved. By the tenth minute, they had narrowed the gap to 54-59, trailing by only two baskets. By the fifteenth minute, they had already tied the score. After that, the two sides traded points, with the score difference staying within one or two points. The entire audience applauded and cheered for the players' brilliant performances.

　　With three minutes left, the Beijing team led 68-63 by five points. Some spectators thought that the outcome was decided and were preparing to leave their seats, but in the blink of an eye, the Sichuan team narrowed the gap to 66-68, and the game entered its most tense moment. There were only ten seconds left. The audience was anxious for the Sichuan team, but the Sichuan team players remained extremely calm and launched a white-hot battle. With only a few seconds remaining, the Beijing team players, eager to win, made a passing error. The Sichuan team player got the ball and went for a layup. Just as the ball left his hand, the buzzer sounded. Although the ball did not go in, the Beijing player was fouled and awarded two free throws.

　　The noisy arena suddenly fell silent. The Sichuan team's center, Zhang Genquan, made both free throws, creating a miraculous outcome: after the game-ending buzzer sounded, the score was tied 68-68.

　　The five-minute "decisive period" battle went as people had expected. The Beijing team was defeated by its lack of depth in the reserves. On the court, the Sichuan team still maintained its key players, while the Beijing team was only led by the veteran Wang Yicheng along with four rookies. In the end, they lost 74-76.

　　In this game, the Sichuan team defeated a powerful opponent and ultimately won. The key was that the Sichuan team had high morale, tenacity, and composure. During the battle, although they were at a disadvantage several times, and were still trailing by two points in the last second, they truly persevered until the very last second, regained the precious two points, and achieved the final victory. For the Sichuan team, this victory was a precious one. The Beijing team also displayed their proactive, agile, and fast style in this game. However, the two points lost at the end are also a lesson worth learning. (Attached picture)

    棋逢对手　将遇良才
    ——记男篮四川胜北京的一场比赛
    吴重远　胡思升
    15日晚上，北京赛车场上举行的北京男子篮球队和四川男子篮球队一场战斗，从始至终打得难解难分，扣人心弦。双方反复拉锯，不断争夺，你追我赶，成为这场球赛的特点，也是全运会篮球比赛开始以来最剧烈的一场战斗。
    九时五十分，在首都近六千观众的万目注视下，双方队员进入场内，引起了观众的纷纷议论。这是一场带有全运会男子篮球锦标落谁之手的关键性的战斗。从男子篮球比赛开始以来，只有北京和四川两队保持了五战五胜的不败纪录。北京队是久负盛名、经验丰富的强队，而四川队是一支异军突起的新生力量。因此，在宽大的赛车场中，充满着紧张、热烈的气氛。
    比赛开始，就显出这两支球队将有一场不寻常的剧战。四川队首开纪录以后，北京队采用人盯人，力图破坏四川队的外线配合进攻。四川队的中锋张根铨被北京队员牢牢看紧，很难获得上篮机会，而四川队也采取了积极的联防战术，北京队要突破四川队的坚强防守也感到相当困难。因此，在前五分钟里，双方形成拉锯，北京队以十一比十领先。四川队不愧是一支勇猛顽强的球队，在通过中锋的战术并无收效的时候，就大胆切进，采取了猛攻猛打，北京队求胜心切，接连不断犯规，到八分钟时，四川队开始领先一分。
    北京队在稍稍落后以后，也开始了反击，运用快攻，通过中锋、底线切入等相结合的战术，又取得了优势。到十二分钟时，北京队已领先九分之多。但是，正像人们所预料的，四川队即使处于十分不利的地位，也丝毫没有泄气的表现，依然鼓足勇气，应付困难的局面。再展开猛攻，果然收到了效果，到上半时结束时，已经追成三十五比三十七，只落后了两分。
    在休息时间内，场上引起了种种的议论。人们并不从两队的技术或意志来猜测这场球赛的结果，因为从上半时的比赛中，人们看到两队队员都有着相当熟练的技术和集体配合，人们也看到两队队员的勇猛和顽强的意志。更多的是从两队如何保持实力以争取最后胜利上来看两队的得失。而正是在这一关上，北京队显然是处于劣势。主力队员多数已犯规三、四次，稍有不慎，将被罚出场外，而北京队的最大的弱点正是后备力量不足。
    下半时开始，北京队显露出了自己的弱点，由于主力队员犯规过多，不敢大胆施展身手，造成防守上过多的漏洞。在四川队猛烈的攻击中，处于被动，在五分钟以内，四川队连投带罚，一共得了十一分，而北京队仅仅罚中一分，形成三十八比四十八的北京队落后十分的局面。人们已经开始为北京队担忧。但是，北京队也并没有气馁，在暂停以后，新手张泰荣换下了老将何诗荪。在这样紧张的关头启用新手，固然是由于主力队员已犯规过多，不得不保持相当实力，但也是指挥作战的教练一个新的尝试。张泰荣上场后，打得十分勇猛活跃，中场断球，篮下切入，两次远投得分，北京队顿然改观。到十分钟时，追成五十四比五十九，仅仅落后两球，到十五分钟时已经追成平手。此后双方互有得失，比分相差在一、二分之内，全场观众都为双方选手的精采表演而鼓掌欢呼。
    到最后三分钟时，北京队以六十八比六十三领先五分，一些观众认为大局已定，正准备离座，但是转眼间，四川队又追成六十六比六十八，球赛进入了最紧张的时刻。剩下的时间已只有十秒钟。观众们为四川队焦急，而四川队队员依然万分沉着，展开了一场白热化的战斗。还剩下最后几秒钟了，北京队队员求胜心切，传球失误，四川队队员得球上篮，球刚出手，锣声已响，虽然球未进，而北京队员犯规被罚两球。
    轰动的场上突然变得鸦雀无声，四川队中锋张根铨连罚连中，形成了这场球赛奇妙的结果：在球赛结束锣声响了以后出现六十八比六十八的平局。
    延长五分钟的“决胜期”战斗，正如人们所预料的，北京队败在后备力量的不足。在场上，四川队依然保存了自己的主力，而北京队仅老将王忆诚一人带领了四名新手应战，而终以七十四比七十六败北。
    这场比赛，四川队战胜了强有力的对手而最后获胜，关键之点在于：四川队斗志昂扬，顽强沉着，在战斗过程中，虽然几度处于劣势，在最后一秒钟还是落后两分。但是，他们名副其实地坚持到最后一秒钟，夺回了宝贵的两分，而且取得了最后的胜利。对四川队来说，这次胜利是珍贵的胜利。北京队在这场比赛中，也表现了他们积极主动、灵活快速的风格。但是，最后失去的两分，也是一个值得吸取的教训。（附图片）
