Xinhua News Agency, 11th — Today, the PLA men's and women's basketball teams both lost to the Hebei men's and women's basketball teams, bringing new changes to the situation of the National Games basketball finals. Currently, only the Beijing men's and women's teams and the Sichuan men's team remain undefeated.

The Hebei men's team produced an unexpected result against the PLA men's team. The PLA team, with seven athletes, started with a fierce offensive, but the Hebei team did not show weakness, closely following. The score became 15-10, 16-14, with the PLA team leading. At this time, the PLA team's forwards were extremely active under the basket, and soon the score became 21-15, leading by six points. The Hebei team used a time-out to discuss countermeasures, adopting a tactic of high-scoring centers sneaking under the basket, repeatedly scoring points. By the thirteenth minute, they had narrowed the gap to 24-22. Seeing the situation was not good, the PLA team launched a counter-offensive, making it 34-27. Although the Hebei team was at a disadvantage, it did not lose heart. However, the PLA team frequently made passing errors, so the Hebei team seized the opportunity and took advantage of the momentum to counter-attack. With half a minute remaining in the first half, the two sides tied at 38. The Hebei team's fighting spirit caused applause from the audience. Just over ten seconds later, the Hebei team continued its efforts and scored another goal. Finally, at the end of the first half, it reversed the situation and defeated the PLA team by two points, 40-38. In the second half, the Hebei team played even more bravely and tenaciously, and the score soared. In the end, they won with an advantage of 87-70.

    篮球决赛形势起了新的变化
    河北男女队双胜解放军队
    据新华社11日讯　今天解放军男、女子篮球队双双败给河北男、女子篮球队，使全运会篮球决赛的形势起了新的变化。现在，保持不败的只有北京男、女队和四川男队。
    河北男队对解放军男队打出了出人意料的结果。拥有七名运动健将的解放军队开始攻势很猛，但河北队并不示弱，紧紧跟上，比分打成十五比十，十六比十四，解放军队领先。这时，解放军队前锋在篮下极为活跃，不久便打成二十一比十五，领先六分。河北队利用暂停时间，商量对策，采用高个中锋在篮下偷袭，屡屡得分。到十三分钟时，追成二十四比二十二。解放军队见情况不妙，又连续发动反攻，打成三十四比二十七。河北队虽然居于劣势，仍不气馁。而解放军队却传球经常失误，于是，河北队抓紧机会，趁势反攻。到距上半时结束还剩半分钟时，双方打成三十八平。河北队的奋战精神引起的全场掌声，刚刚经过十几秒，河北队再接再厉，又中一球。终于在上半场结束时，以四十比三十八反胜解放军队两分。下半场，河北队打得更为勇猛顽强，得分扶摇直上，最后，终以八十七比七十的优势获胜。
    河北女子队双中锋打得十分出色，以六十六比六十三胜解放军队。
    其他各场结果，男子队是：北京队胜广东队（七十四比六十），辽宁队胜上海队（八十九比六十二），吉林队胜陕西队（七十六比七十一），四川队胜黑龙江队（七十五比七十三），江苏队胜湖北队（九十二比七十三）。女子队是：上海队胜云南队（六十比四十六），吉林队胜贵州队（五十四比四十九），四川队胜山西队（五十七比四十四），湖北队胜江苏队（五十比四十一），北京队胜广东队（六十三比五十七）。
