Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: The locust control battle in the autumn locust-stricken areas of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces has achieved a decisive victory. Large and dense swarms of autumn locusts in the four provinces have been basically eliminated, and efforts are currently underway to eliminate the remaining locusts. Hebei Province is also encircling and annihilating autumn locusts that have spread to seven counties, including Huanghua. According to inspections in Qingfeng, Nanle and other counties in Henan Province, after sweeping up the remaining locusts, an average of less than one escaped locust is found per 50 mu of land.

This year, the autumn locust occurrence area in Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hebei provinces reached more than 21 million mu at its peak, exceeding the expected occurrence area. By the end of August, the treated area had reached more than 84%. The reason for the expansion of the autumn locust area this year is that in July and August, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces experienced severe drought, with low rainfall and high temperatures, which was conducive to the occurrence of locust nymphs; in the lake and river locust areas, the scope of the locust area gradually expanded due to the continuous decline of water levels. For the same reason, the density of locust nymphs was generally higher than in previous years. In Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces, more than 110,000 mu of late autumn crops had their leaves bitten by locust nymphs.

After the outbreak of autumn locusts in most locust areas, the people's communes in the locust areas uniformly mobilized manpower to fight drought and eliminate locusts at the same time. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of locust control aircraft, they launched a major battle against autumn locusts in the spirit of "man will conquer nature." In the locust area of Henan Province, more than 7.81 million people were mobilized to eliminate locusts, rapidly eliminating the main force of autumn locusts. The locust control team in Changyi County, Shandong Province, put forward the slogan of "not missing one mu, not leaving one locust", and launched a fierce attack, eliminating one whenever one was found. All 110,000 mu of farmland in the county affected by autumn locusts have been treated. In the battle to encircle and suppress autumn locusts, the state dispatched 24 aircraft to spray pesticides to kill locusts, which strongly supported and encouraged the locust control work in various locust areas.

After the main force of autumn locusts was eliminated, all locust areas immediately turned to sweeping up the remaining locusts.

Xinhua News Agency: Farmers in Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan and other provinces are seizing the opportunity after the rain to vigorously plant late autumn crops and autumn vegetables, strengthen field management, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest to recover the losses caused by disasters.

After the rain, Shandong quickly transferred the main force of the drought resistance army to planting late autumn crops and autumn vegetables. By August 29, the province had planted 8.57 million mu of buckwheat, rape, carrots, and other crops. Fan County, which was severely affected by the drought, planted 33,000 mu of carrots, radishes, buckwheat, and other crops on the first day after the rain on August 26. People's communes in the Linyi area launched a mass planting campaign, planting 230,000 mu of buckwheat and 420,000 mu of various autumn vegetables in five days.

From August 29 to September 3, in the five days of the rainy season, Anhui took advantage of the good opportunity to plant and replant more than 5.7 million mu of late autumn crops in vacant land and among drought-affected autumn crops. Fuyang mobilized 1.27 million people in one day to plant more than 180,000 mu. Huaining County in Anqing arranged labor, adjusted seeds and fertilizers, and quickly launched a planting upsurge after the rain.

Henan Province has sown more than 16 million mu of autumn vegetables this year, twice as much as last year. Because most of them were planted by fighting drought and watering, there were more missing seedlings. Farmers in the rain-affected areas immediately carried out seedling inspection and replanting, as well as soil preparation, fertilizer application, and pest control after the rain. After a rush to replant, the 14,500 mu of autumn vegetables with missing seedlings in Nanzhao County have been replanted. Wu Village Brigade of Chengguan Commune in Fugou County mobilized more than 300 people, working hard for two days after the rain to remove weeds from 280 mu, control pests on 345 mu, replant seedlings on 26 mu, and also poured a layer of human waste on each plant in 124 mu of autumn vegetable fields.

Jiangsu planted more than 200,000 mu of late autumn crops on September 1 alone. Jurong County in the southern hilly area dispatched more than 53,500 people in the rain, planting more than 11,000 mu in one day. Shangxing People's Commune in Liyang County received a rain forecast, seized the time to turn the land and prepare the ridges, and immediately rushed to plant after the rain, making rapid progress and completing 40% of the planting plan for carrots, autumn vegetables, etc. in one day. At present, the province has completed more than 70% of the planting area of late autumn crops.

Yunnan has planted more than 3.6 million mu of late autumn crops after the rain. Leaders at all levels in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture went deep into the communes and production teams, leading disaster relief and weeding on one hand, and helping to solve specific problems such as labor arrangement, seeds, and funds on the other hand, which greatly accelerated the planting progress of late autumn crops. The whole state has overfulfilled the original planting plan. In Yao County, which was severely affected by the drought, the work of seizing the time to plant after the rain was started early, and late autumn crops have been planted in the mountainous and dam areas, and on the edges of the fields.

The Wenzhou area of Zhejiang deployed to plant 600,000 mu of vegetables in three to five days. Now, counties such as Ruian, Xianju, Jingning, and Longquan have overfulfilled the planting task by 70,000 mu. Jinhua has also planted more than 280,000 mu of radish and carrots after the rain. Yongkang County planted 9,400 mu of vegetables and green manure in one day. The planting work is being carried out in full swing throughout the province.

    河南安徽等四省基本消灭秋蝗  山东江苏等六省雨后抢种晚秋
    据新华社4日讯  山东、河南、江苏、安徽四省发生秋蝗的地区，灭蝗战斗取得了决定性的胜利。四省大片、密集的秋蝗已经基本消灭，目前正在消灭残蝗。河北省也正围歼流窜于黄骅等七县的秋蝗。据河南省清丰、南乐等县检查，扫残后平均每五十亩地漏网的残蝗不到一只。
    今年山东、河南、江苏、安徽、河北五省秋蝗发生面积，最多时共达二千一百多万亩，超过了预计发生的面积。到8月底防治面积已达84％以上。今年秋蝗面积扩大的原因是，7、8两月，山东、河南、江苏、安徽四省发生严重旱象，降雨量少气温高，有利于蝗蝻的发生；沿湖、沿河蝗区，因水位一再下落，蝗区范围也逐渐扩大。由于同样原因，蝗蝻密度一般也比往年高。山东、河南、江苏三省，曾有十一万多亩晚秋作物被蝗蝻咬了叶子。
    大部分蝗区秋蝗发生后，蝗区的人民公社统一调动人力，一面抗旱，一面灭蝗，在党的领导下，在灭蝗飞机的支援下，以“人定胜天”的精神同秋蝗展开了大战。河南省蝗区，先后出动了七百八十一万多人次灭蝗，迅速消灭了秋蝗主力。山东省昌邑县的灭蝗队伍，提出了“一亩不漏，一蝗不留”的口号，猛攻猛打，发现一个，消灭一个，全县十一万亩发生秋蝗的农田，全部得到了防治。在围剿秋蝗的战斗中，国家出动二十四架飞机撒药灭蝗，有力地支援和鼓舞了各蝗区的灭蝗工作。
    各蝗区在秋蝗主力消灭以后，立即转入了扫残工作。
    据新华社讯　山东、安徽、河南、江苏、浙江、云南等省农民抓紧雨后时机，大力抢种晚秋作物和秋菜，加强田间管理，力争秋季丰收，夺回因灾害所受的损失。
    山东各地雨后将抗旱大军的主力迅速调到抢种晚秋作物和秋菜方面。到8月29日，全省抢种了荞麦、油菜、胡萝卜等八百五十七万亩。旱情严重的范县，到8月26日雨后第一天，就抢种了胡萝卜、大萝卜、荞麦等三万三千亩。临沂专区各人民公社开展全民抢种运动，五天就种下荞麦二十三万亩，各种秋菜四十二万亩。
    安徽各地从8月29日到9月3日五天内，乘雨季良机，已经利用空闲地抢种和在中秋旱作物中补种、套种了五百七十多万亩晚秋作物。阜阳专区一天就发动一百二十七万人，抢种十八万多亩。安庆专区怀宁县安排好劳动力，调整好种子和肥料，在雨后迅速掀起了抢种高潮。
    河南省今年播种秋菜一千六百多万亩，比去年增加两倍。因为绝大部分是抗旱浇水抢种的，因此缺苗断垅较多，落雨地区农民趁雨后墒饱，立即开展了查苗补苗和中耕保墒、追肥、治虫运动。南召县一万四千五百多亩缺苗秋菜，经过雨后突击，已经补种完毕。扶沟县城关公社吴庄大队出动三百多人，雨后奋战两天，剔除杂草二百八十亩，治虫三百四十五亩，补苗二十六亩，还在一百二十四亩秋菜田里逐棵浇了一遍人粪尿。
    江苏各地9月1日一天就抢种了二十多万亩晚秋作物。南部丘陵山区的句容县，冒雨出动五万三千五百多人，一天就抢种了一万一千多亩。溧阳县的上兴人民公社收到下雨预报，就抓紧时机把地翻好，埨子做好，雨后立即抢种，进度很快，一天就完成了胡萝卜、秋菜等播种计划40％。目前全省晚秋作物播种面积已完成70％以上。
    云南各地雨后已种下晚秋作物三百六十多万亩。楚雄彝族自治州的各级领导干部深入公社和生产队，一面领导抗灾和中耕除草，一面帮助解决劳力安排、籽种、资金等具体问题，使晚秋作物播种进度大大加快，全州已超额完成原订的播种计划。受旱比较严重的大姚县，由于雨后抢种工作抓得早，山区坝区，田边地角，都已种上晚秋作物。
    浙江温州专区部署三天到五天内抢种蔬菜六十万亩，现在瑞安、仙居、景宁、龙泉等县已经超额七万亩完成抢种任务。金华专区雨后还种下了萝卜和胡萝卜二十八万多亩。永康县在一天中就抢种下蔬菜、绿肥等九千四百多亩。全省各地抢种工作正在全面开展。
