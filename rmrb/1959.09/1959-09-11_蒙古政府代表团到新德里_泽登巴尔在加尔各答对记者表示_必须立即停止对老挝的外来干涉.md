    Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation were diplomatic envoys to India from socialist countries and some Asian and African countries.

    In his welcoming speech, Prime Minister Nehru spoke of the close contact between the two countries in the past and said that this contact was cultural, not one of "aggression and pressure." He said that this visit is a sign and symbol of friendship between the two countries.

    The welcoming crowd presented many garlands to the Mongolian government leader who was visiting India for the first time.

    In the afternoon, Chairman Tsedenbal and his entourage went to Rajghat to lay a wreath at Gandhi's tomb.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 9th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, Tsedenbal, told reporters in Calcutta today that unless foreign interference in Laos is stopped immediately, peace in Southeast Asia will be undermined. Chairman Tsedenbal and the Mongolian government delegation he leads arrived in Calcutta this afternoon. The delegation will visit India for a week at the invitation of the Indian government.

    In answering a reporter's question about his opinion on the Sino-Indian border issue, Chairman Tsedenbal said that he did not know the whole situation very well. He had no doubt that India and China, the two great signatories of the Panchsheel Agreement, would resolve their disputes in accordance with the Panchsheel principles. He stressed that this must be resolved by India and China themselves.
