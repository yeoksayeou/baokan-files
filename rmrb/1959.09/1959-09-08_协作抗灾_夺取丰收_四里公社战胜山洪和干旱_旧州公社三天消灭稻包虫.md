    Cooperating in Disaster Relief, Achieving a Bumper Harvest
    Sili Commune Overcomes Floods and Drought, Jiuzhou Commune Eliminates Rice Leaf Rollers in Three Days
    Xinhua News Agency report: The people of Sili People's Commune in Guiyang, Hunan, have promoted a strong spirit of cooperation among the production teams, overcoming unprecedented floods and droughts, and achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield of 10,901 mu of early rice in the commune was 406 jin per mu, an increase of 21% compared to 1958. The harvest of 31,451 mu of mid-season rice was even better. According to statistics from the 12,500 mu that have already been harvested, the average yield per mu reached 520 jin, an increase of 27.5% compared to last year.
    This year, when the early rice was just heading and the mid-season rice had just been transplanted, there was an unprecedented massive flood, which washed away many reservoirs, ponds, river dams, and irrigation canals, and flooded 15,400 mu of crops. These washed-out and damaged water conservancy projects had to be fully restored within six or seven days. However, this required more than 72,000 labor days, and more than 70% of the projects were concentrated in five mountainous brigades, which only had about 3,000 laborers. If they relied solely on their own strength to repair them, it would take half a month to complete. In accordance with the spirit of viewing the entire commune as a single unit, the commune Party committee mobilized more than 3,500 laborers from ten hilly area brigades that had not suffered from floods or had suffered very little damage to support the mountainous brigades in the emergency repairs. After five days and five nights of hard work, all the washed-out and damaged water conservancy projects were repaired, and the ponds and reservoirs were further connected, improving irrigation capacity.
    In mid-June, a drought occurred, affecting more than 30,000 mu, with the hilly areas being the most severely affected. At this time, several mountainous brigades with lighter drought conditions came to help fight the drought. The Shimentou production team of Yinquan Brigade had 150 mu of mid-season rice that was about to dry up completely. The neighboring Leitang Brigade decided to properly advance the draining and sunning of their own 105 mu of early rice, which was about to mature, change the plan to plant late rice to sowing autumn grain crops, and release the water saved to the 150 mu of mid-season rice in Shimentou team, ensuring the bumper harvest of the 150 mu of mid-season rice in Shimentou team.
    When the Sili Commune summarized the experience of this year's early and mid-season rice bumper harvest, the commune members deeply felt that without the people's commune, it would not have been possible to overcome this year's water and drought disasters, and there would not have been this year's bumper harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency report: Miao and Han members of the Jiuzhou People's Commune in Huangping County, Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, brought into play the strength of the collective, promoted a strong spirit of cooperation, and fought for three days and three nights to completely eliminate rice leaf rollers in more than 9,200 mu of rice paddies.
    In early August, just as the commune's rice was generally heading and flowering, and a bumper harvest was in sight, more than 9,000 mu of rice in the Jiuzhou Dam were suddenly attacked by rice leaf rollers. The production teams affected by the insect pests immediately organized forces to capture and kill them, but due to the rapid spread, the affected rice paddies became more and more numerous. The commune Party committee and the commune management committee immediately convened a telephone conference, calling on commune members in areas without insect pests to contribute to overcoming the insect pests and winning a bumper grain harvest for the entire commune. This call immediately received enthusiastic response from all production teams. The four management areas without insect pests dispatched a total of more than 3,000 people to the Jiuzhou Dam to support the insect eradication struggle. Together with the commune members in the insect pest-affected areas, the entire commune quickly formed an insect eradication army of more than 12,000 people. After three days and three nights of hard work, a total of more than 43,000 jin of insects were captured, thoroughly eliminating the unprecedented massive insect pest disaster.

    协作抗灾　夺取丰收
    四里公社战胜山洪和干旱　旧州公社三天消灭稻包虫
    据新华社讯　湖南桂阳四里人民公社各生产队间大兴协作之风，战胜了数十年来所未有的山洪和干旱，取得了空前大丰收。全社一万零九百零一亩早稻平均亩产四百零六斤，比1958年增产21％；三万一千四百五十一亩中稻收成更好，据已收割的一万二千五百亩统计，平均亩产达五百二十斤，比去年增产27.5％。
    今年，早稻正开兜圆脚、中稻刚插下去的时候，发生了数十年来所没有的大山洪，冲垮许多水库、山塘、河坝、水圳，遭受洪水浸袭的农作物达一万五千四百亩。这些被冲垮冲坏的水利工程，必须在六、七天时间内全部恢复起来。但需要七万二千多个劳动日，70％以上工程又是集中在五个山区大队，而这五个队只有三千来个劳动力，如果光靠自己的力量去修，半个月也完不成。公社党委根据全社一盘棋的精神，从没有遭受山洪灾害和受害很小的十个丘陵地区的大队，抽调了三千五百多个劳力，支援山区大队抢修。奋战五天五晚，就把所有被冲垮冲坏的水利工程修复了，把山塘水库进一步串连起来，提高了灌溉能力。
    6月中旬，干旱又发生了，受旱面积三万多亩，其中以丘陵区最为严重。正是这时，旱情比较轻的几个山区大队，前来协助抗旱。阴泉大队石门头生产队一百五十亩中稻，眼看就要全部干死。邻近的雷塘大队决定把自己队快成熟的一百零五亩早稻适当提早落水晒田，把插种晚稻的计划，改成播种秋收杂粮作物，把节约下来的水放到石门头的一百五十亩中稻田里。保证了石门头队一百五十亩中稻丰收。
    四里公社在总结今年早、中稻丰收经验时，社员们都深深感到没有人民公社化就不能战胜今年的水旱灾，就没有今年的大丰收。
    据新华社讯　贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州黄平县旧州人民公社的苗、汉社员，发挥集体力量，大兴协作之风，奋战三天三夜，把九千二百多亩稻田里的稻包虫全部歼灭干净。
    8月上旬，正当全社水稻普遍吐穗扬花、丰收在望的时候，旧州大坝上九千多亩水稻，突然受到稻包虫袭击。受虫灾的生产队，立即组织力量捕杀，但由于蔓延太快，受害的稻田愈来愈多。公社党委和公社管理委员会，立即召开电话会议，号召无虫灾地区的社员为战胜虫灾出力，夺取全社粮食大丰收。这一号召马上得到各生产队的热烈响应。无虫灾的四个管理区，一共派出三千多人到旧州大坝，支援灭虫斗争，加上受虫灾地区的社员，全社迅速组成了一支一万二千多人的灭虫大军。经过三天三夜的奋战，共捉虫约四万三千多斤，彻底歼灭了空前未有的特大虫灾。
