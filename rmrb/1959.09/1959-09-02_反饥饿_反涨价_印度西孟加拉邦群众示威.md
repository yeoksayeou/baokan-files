    Anti-Hunger, Anti-Price Hike
    Mass Demonstrations in West Bengal, India
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 1st: According to reports from Calcutta, at least 25,000 people demonstrated in front of the West Bengal State Secretariat in Calcutta on August 31st, demanding access to cheap grain. The demonstration was organized by the Committee Against Price Hikes and Against Hunger.
    According to the "Times of India," police wearing steel helmets threw tear gas and used batons against the demonstrators, injuring 350 people, including some women.
    This demonstration marked the climax of the grain unrest that began in West Bengal forty-nine days ago. Workers, students, and farmers from rural areas near Calcutta, ignoring police arrests and detentions, gathered in Calcutta's squares for mass rallies. Subsequently, they marched to the West Bengal State Secretariat, where they remained for an hour and a half.
    According to the "Hindustan Times," as of August 29th, 6,411 people had been arrested by the authorities in connection with this movement. The "Times of India" said that on the eve of the August 31st demonstration, the police arrested another 100 people. Among those arrested were many members of parliament and leaders of left-wing parties.
    As the anti-hunger, anti-price hike movement in West Bengal reached its climax, the Indian Council of States yesterday concluded a two-day debate on the current grain situation. Communist leader Gupta demanded the complete implementation of a state-run grain policy.
    The newly appointed Food Minister Patil, in his first policy speech after taking office, said that state management of grain would only be adopted when necessary. He said, "If I can do well without using this method, I will be happy, because one day, if not now, in five, ten, or twenty years, a free economy will inevitably emerge."
    Some members of the Congress Party also opposed the state-run grain approach adopted by the Congress Party's Nagpur conference.

    反饥饿  反涨价
    印度西孟加拉邦群众示威
    据新华社新德里1日电　据加尔各答消息，8月31日至少有两万五千人在加尔各答的西孟加拉邦秘书处门前示威，要求买到廉价粮食。这次示威是由反对涨价和反对饥饿委员会组织的。
    据“印度时报”报道，头戴钢盔的警察向示威者扔了催泪弹和使用了警棍，有三百五十人受伤，其中包括一些妇女。
    这次示威使西孟加拉邦在四十九天前开始的粮食骚动达到高潮。来自加尔各答附近农村的工人、学生和农民，不顾警察的逮捕和拘留，聚集在加尔各答广场举行了群众大会。随后，他们游行到西孟加拉邦秘书处，在那里呆了一个半小时。
    据“印度斯坦时报”报道，到8月29日为止，已经有六千四百一十一人因同这一运动有关而被当局逮捕。“印度时报”说，在8月31日举行示威的前夕，警察又逮捕了另外一百人。被捕的人中，有许多议员和左翼政党领袖。
    与西孟加拉邦反饥饿反涨价运动进入高潮的同时，印度联邦院昨天结束了为期两天的有关目前粮食情况的辩论。共产党领袖古普塔要求彻底执行国家经营粮食的政策。
    新上任的粮食部长帕蒂尔在发表他就职后的第一篇政策演说时说，只有在必要时才会采用国家经营粮食的办法。他说，“如果我能办好，而无需使用这种办法的话，我将感到高兴，因为终有一天，如果不是现在的话，在五年、十年或者二十年以后，自由经济必将出现。”
    一些国大党人也反对由国大党那格浦尔会议通过的国家经营粮食的做法。
