Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 10th: The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the Sino-Indian border issue on August 30th. The full text is as follows:

The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India, like our people, is concerned about the unfortunate incidents that have recently occurred in certain places on the Himalayan border. There can be no two opinions about the need to defend the integrity of our country's territory. According to Panchsheel, India and China have an obligation to respect each other's territorial integrity. However, unfortunately, a large part of our northern border has not been clearly demarcated. Moreover, since there is no formal agreement between Free India and the People's Republic of China on this issue, it is easy to cause confusion and misunderstanding. The recent incidents involving border patrols of India and China occurred under these circumstances. The Secretariat of the National Council of the Communist Party of India earnestly hopes that the governments of the two countries will immediately take steps to resolve all border disputes through joint discussions. It also believes that there are no outstanding issues between our two countries that cannot be resolved through friendly consultation.

The enemies of freedom and peace are using these unfortunate incidents to undermine the friendly relations between our two great countries. We must absolutely not allow this to happen, because Sino-Indian friendship not only strengthens the independence of Asian countries, but is also the cornerstone of unity and peace among Asian countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 10th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Gopalan, Deputy Leader of the Communist Party of India in the People's House, said at a mass rally held in Gaya on the evening of August 31st, "The much-publicized Chinese invasion of the Indian border is nothing but a terrible claim manufactured by newspapers and a deeply rooted conspiracy by Western imperialists and vested interest groups, for whom Sino-Indian friendship is a thorn in their side."

Gopalan also said at the meeting that it would be foolish to think that China would attack or invade India.

Gopalan said that there is no doubt that there are some differences between India and China on the border issue, and these issues can be resolved through peaceful negotiations, but the British and American imperialists, who themselves invaded India, are trying to fish in troubled waters.

According to the Indian Press Trust, Gopalan said at a public gathering in Patna on August 29th that the Communist Party of India hopes that the friendship between India and China will be increasingly consolidated, which is not only in the interests of India and China, but also in the interests of the whole world. He pointed out that some parties in India are trying to drive a wedge between India and China.

The Communist Party of India's newspaper "Freedom Daily" published an editorial on the Sino-Indian border issue on September 1st, stating, "Socialist China cannot pose a threat to India. The incidents on the border are the conspiracy of the United States and Britain. According to this conspiracy, they are now making despicable efforts to create Sino-Indian disputes."

The editorial emphasized, "The Indian people know very well that this threat to India can never come from great China." The editorial said, "People must never forget that it is the imperialists who are plotting on the Sino-Indian border. We call on our compatriots across the country to always pay attention to this fundamental thing. As long as this is remembered, everyone will fight to maintain the friendly relations between India and China without any damage."

The editorial pointed out that the boundary line was drawn during the British regime. "Even this boundary cannot be said to have been fully demarcated. Moreover, independent India and the People's Republic of China have never discussed or tried to resolve this matter so far. It is for this reason that the Chinese Premier has expressed the hope to resolve this dispute through joint discussions."

The editorial said, "However, some people have abandoned this view, calling the border issue an 'attack on India.' It is this practice that complicates the situation." On this issue, the Communist Party of India has repeatedly issued clear statements stating that the Sino-Indian border issue can only be resolved through peaceful negotiations between the two countries, and only this path should be taken.

The editorial, while criticizing the anti-China behavior of the Congress Party leaders in West Bengal, said, "It is extremely unfortunate that in the leaflets distributed by the Congress Party in West Bengal and in the speeches of Congress Party leader Atulya Ghosh, China is referred to as an imperialist aggressor, thus poisoning the atmosphere in the Sino-Indian dispute. Ghosh and other speakers used this border incident to launch an anti-communist crusade."

The Tamil newspaper "People's Power" published an editorial on August 31st, calling on Indian and Chinese politicians to redouble their efforts to resolve border disputes "in a friendly manner," "so as not to give the imperialists, who are poking their noses everywhere in Asia and looking for opportunities to undermine Sino-Indian friendship, an opportunity to take advantage of."

The newspaper pointed out that only those who are completely opposed to the neutral foreign policy are now using some border incidents as an excuse to promote an anti-China crusade. The newspaper went on to say that the ulterior motive of these people is to place India under the wings of the United States.

    印度共产党发表声明
    中印边境问题应通过协商解决
    高普兰指出印度有些党派力图离间印中关系
    新华社新德里10日电　印度共产党全国委员会书记处8月30日就印中边界问题发表声明，全文如下：
    印度共产党全国委员会书记处和我国人民一样关注着最近喜马拉雅边境上的某些地方所发生的不幸事件。对于必须保卫我国领土的完整这一点，是不可能有两种意见的。根据潘查希拉，印度和中国彼此负有尊重对方的领土的完整的义务。但是，不幸的是，我国北部的一大部分边境一直没有明确的划定界线。而且，由于自由印度同中华人民共和国之间在这个问题上并无任何正式的协定，因此就易于产生混乱和误解。最近的一些牵涉到印度和中国两国的边境巡逻部队的事件就是在这种情况下发生的。印度共产党全国委员会书记处热切希望有关两国政府立即采取步骤，通过共同的讨论来解决一切有关边境问题的争论。它还相信，我们两国之间没有任何悬而未决的问题是不能通过友好协商来解决的。
    自由及和平的敌人们正在利用这些不幸事件来破坏我们两大国之间的友好关系。我们绝对不能允许发生这种事情，因为印中友谊不仅加强了亚洲国家的独立，而且也是亚洲国家之间的团结及和平的基石。
    新华社新德里10日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度人民院共产党党团副领袖高普兰8月31日晚上在伽耶举行的群众集会上说，“大肆宣传的中国侵犯印度边界的事情，只不过是报纸制造的可怕的说法，并且是西方帝国主义分子和既得利益集团根深蒂固的阴谋，对于他们说来，印中友谊是眼中钉”。
    高普兰在会上还说，如果认为中国会袭击或侵略印度，那是愚蠢的。
    高普兰说，毫无疑问，印度和中国在边界问题上存在一些分歧，这些问题可以用和平谈判的方法加以解决，可是自己侵略过印度的英、美帝国主义分子却企图混水摸鱼。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，高普兰8月29日在巴特那举行的公众集会上说，印度共产党希望印度和中国的友谊日益巩固，这不仅是符合印度和中国的利益，而且也符合全世界的利益。他指出，印度有些党派企图离间印度和中国的关系。
    印度共产党报纸“自由报”在9月1日就印中边界问题发表社论说，“社会主义的中国对印度不可能构成威胁，在边境地区肇事的是美英的阴谋，根据这种阴谋，现在正在卑鄙地努力制造中印纠纷。”
    社论强调说，“印度人民很清楚地知道，对印度的这种威胁永远不可能来自伟大的中国。”社论说，“人们决不能忘记，在印中边境上制造阴谋的正是帝国主义者，我们呼吁全国同胞永远留心这个基本的东西。只要记住了这一点，大家就会为保持印中的友好联系丝毫无损而斗争。”
    社论指出，边界线是在英国政权统治时期划的。“甚至连这条边界也没有人能够说已经充分的划定。而且迄今为止，独立的印度和中华人民共和国还从未就这件事情进行讨论或设法加以解决。正是因为这个缘故，中国总理才表示希望通过共同讨论来解决这个纠纷。”
    社论说，“但是，某些人士背弃了这种观点，他们把边界问题说成是‘进攻印度’。正是这种做法使得局势复杂化了。”在这个问题上，印度共产党曾经一再发表明确的声明，表示中印边界问题只有通过两国的和平谈判才有可能得到解决，并且只应当走这条道路。
    社论在指责西孟加拉邦国大党领袖的反华行为的时候说，“极为不幸的是，在西孟加拉邦国大党散发的传单和国大党领袖阿图利亚·高希的讲话中把中国称为帝国主义侵略者，因此就在中印争端中毒化了气氛。高希和其他发言者利用这次边界事件发动反共的十字军运动。”
    泰米尔文“人民力量报”8月31日发表社论，呼吁印度和中国的政治家加倍努力，“以友好的方式”解决边境纠纷，“不让那些在亚洲到处探头探脑，寻找破坏中印友谊的机会的帝国主义者得到可乘之机。”
    这家报纸指出，只有那些彻头彻尾反对中立外交政策的人，现在才以发生一些边境事件为由，鼓吹反华十字军运动。这家报纸接着说，这些人不可告人的目的是把印度置于美国的卵翼之下。
