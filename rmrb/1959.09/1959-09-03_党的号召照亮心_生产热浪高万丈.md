Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch. The railway vehicle production workers across the country fought a beautiful battle in August, building a total of 2,114 freight cars, exceeding the August state plan by 5.7%, and building more than 600 freight cars than in July. The plans for building new locomotives and repairing locomotives and vehicles were also overfulfilled.

At the beginning of August, railway vehicle factories across the country inspected and criticized the right-leaning, fear-of-difficulty sentiments existing in some cadres. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers became even more boosted, and a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory held a leap forward competition meeting on August 10. Within a few days, 2,707 people broke their production quotas, and the average daily casting of cold-rolled wheels increased from 245 to 254. In August, the factory produced 30 more freight cars than originally planned. After studying the People's Daily editorial on August 6, all the employees of the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Factory quickly launched a competition upsurge to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, putting forward 235 technical innovation proposals in one week. Eighty-five of these have been realized, effectively promoting production efficiency and product quality. For example, among the 51 production groups in the freight car workshop, 44 exceeded their quotas, with an average increase of 9% over the original quotas. In order to improve the quality and output of cold-rolled wheels, this factory formed a working group composed of responsible cadres, technicians, and veteran workers, launching mass discussions to analyze the causes of defective products, working alongside the workers, inspecting and improving simultaneously, strengthening the management of molding sand and the control of kiln temperature, and rationally adjusting the process route. This raised the pass rate of cold-rolled wheels from 60% before August 22 to 82%. In August, this factory increased the production of 50 freight cars for the state.

On August 26, the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, further inspiring the enthusiasm of railway vehicle production workers across the country. After studying the communique and resolutions, the workers of the Shijiazhuang Rolling Stock Factory were in high spirits, and the factory completed the August task of building new and repairing freight cars three days ahead of schedule. At present, the workers of various factories are advancing victoriously, determined to manufacture more locomotives and freight cars for the state in September to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd dispatch. The staff and workers of ports, ships, shipyards, waterways, and agencies along the Yangtze River line held mass meetings and symposiums to respond to the call of the Party, determined to overfulfill the quarterly freight volume plan by 100,000 tons and the quarterly freight turnover plan by 200 million ton-kilometers in the third quarter, laying the foundation for overfulfilling the annual transportation plan ahead of schedule. At present, the average daily freight volume of the entire line has increased by more than 25% compared with the period before the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

The staff and workers of the seven major ports of Hankou, Nanjing, Chongqing, Yichang, Ma'anshan, Wuhu, and Huangshi respectively proposed to complete the annual plan half a month to one month ahead of schedule. In order to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan, various ports have decided to carry out technical innovations and develop small-scale machinery combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on the difficulties in loading and unloading bulk cargo such as scrap steel, coal, bulk salt, ore, and sand, as well as large and heavy cargo; at the same time, they will strengthen port-navigation cooperation and do everything possible to expand port throughput capacity. The staff and workers of passenger-cargo ships such as Jiangshun and Jiangya, and tugboats such as Yangtze River 1002 and 2002, have also put forward new plans for increasing production and practicing economy, deciding to continue to promote advanced formations, advanced firing methods, and strengthen ship maintenance. The Jiangshun ship crew, which had previously achieved double leaps forward in production and ideology, is determined to fight hard for four months, ensuring that this year's passenger and freight turnover will increase by 18.3% compared with last year, ensuring safe production, improving service quality, and saving 300 tons of coal and saving other materials by 20% according to quotas in the next four months.

In the first seven months of this year, the freight volume and freight turnover volume of the Yangtze River route increased by 52.6% and 19.7% respectively compared with the same period last year, of which steel and ore both increased by more than double compared with the same period last year; the port throughput capacity increased by nearly 50% compared with the same period last year; and costs decreased by 16.57%. Since early August, the Party Committee of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration has launched a comprehensive inspection of the work of the entire line, criticizing the right-leaning and slackening sentiments among some cadres, and tapping potential from strengthening transportation organization work, opening up night navigation, utilizing economic waterways, and saving coal, so as to achieve a greater leap forward. More than 400 ships directly under the Navigation Bureau and many ports have launched a competition, further increasing the load capacity of ships and shortening the loading and unloading time of ports.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd dispatch. After completing the August state plan ahead of schedule, the 200,000 coal army in Henan Province is continuing to fight hard, determined to complete the September plan two to three days ahead of schedule, ensuring that the province will increase the production of more than 200,000 tons of high-quality coal for the country in the third quarter, welcoming the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

In the past few days, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the coal mine workers in Henan Province have held oath-taking rallies, discussed the production increase plan for September, formulated production increase measures, and widely launched a competition movement centered on high production, high quality, safety, and low cost. After August 26, the daily coal output of the province has continuously broken through the 70,000-ton mark.

All coal mines in the province have strengthened equipment maintenance, roadway maintenance, and production preparation work. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine workers also proposed the practice of "producing and preparing simultaneously, preparing one day for production, producing to the end, preparing to the end," so as to achieve a good start, daily red, and a full month of red in September.

Leading cadres have gone to the front line of production to direct production. From the Provincial Coal Industry Bureau to the various mining bureaus, working groups headed by the chief engineer have been established to organize advanced units to impart advanced experience. A large number of cadres from various mining bureaus have gone to the mines to strengthen political and ideological work and fight alongside the workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 2nd dispatch. More than 30 large, medium, and small factories in the two major systems of the Dalian-Lushun Municipal Heavy Industry Bureau and the Machinery Industry Bureau have completed the August production plan ahead of schedule. The total output value of the Heavy Industry Bureau system in August increased by 40% compared with July; the total output value of the Machinery Industry Bureau system in August increased by 14.8% compared with July. Central government directly affiliated enterprises such as Dalian Chemical Plant, Petroleum No. 7 Plant, and Dalian Seaport also completed the August plan ahead of schedule, and the production level has greatly improved compared with July.

In August, the staff and workers on the industrial front of Dalian and Lushun set off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. The Machinery Bureau convened a three-level cadre meeting in mid-August, criticized the right-leaning ideology of a small number of cadres, thoroughly implemented the quality improvement plan, adopted the method of focusing on large-scale and ensuring key projects, vigorously promoted collaboration, and firmly grasped scheduling work, so that the production of various factories gradually increased. For example, the Dalian Valve Factory only completed 20% of the production plan in early August. After criticizing the right-leaning ideology of some cadres, the cadres participated in production and directed production, completing more than 60% of the entire month's plan in the ten days of mid-August, and as a result, they completed the August production plan eight days ahead of schedule, and the products produced supported the construction of more than a dozen key projects. The Heavy Industry Bureau system further inspired the enthusiasm of the workers through anti-rightist ideology. Most factories still completed the plan ahead of schedule when the production tasks increased by 30% to 40% compared with July.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 2nd dispatch. The Fengman Power Plant overfulfilled the plan by 25.7% in August, generating 23.93 million more kilowatt-hours for the country.

Since the beginning of this year, the staff and workers of the Fengman Power Plant have tried every means to use less water and generate more electricity on the basis of ensuring safe operation, so as to meet the needs of all parties for electricity. From January to July, the power generation of this plant exceeded the plan by 46.5%, generating 131.66 million more kilowatt-hours, saving 100 million tons of water, saving 200,000 kilowatt-hours of plant electricity, and reducing costs by 5.65%. Since August, under the slogan of "generating one more kilowatt-hour of electricity and adding one more point of light to the motherland," the staff and workers of this plant have universally launched a competition between branch plants and branch plants, units and units, shifts and shifts, and individuals, promoting further improvement in production. The staff and workers of the Hydraulic Engineering Branch strengthened the forecasting work of hydrology and meteorology, and made the forecasts timely and accurate. Therefore, the water storage work was better than in the past, ensuring the needs of power generation. The workers of the Operation Branch adjusted the power generation in a timely manner according to the water level of the reservoir, so as to achieve reasonable water use. With the efforts of the staff and workers, the amount of water used for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by this plant in August has been reduced from 10 tons to about 7 tons, saving a total of 63 million tons of water in the whole month. The entire plant has also formulated a system to save plant electricity. Therefore, the plant electricity in August saved 32,000 kilowatt-hours compared with the plan.

In order to respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the staff and workers of this plant plan to generate 11% more electricity than the national plan this year, and save 450,000 kilowatt-hours of plant electricity, save 200 million tons of water, and reduce costs by 200,000 yuan in the next four months.
