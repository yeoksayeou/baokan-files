Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th – Korean newspapers "Rodong Sinmun," "Democratic Korea," and "Pyongyang Sinmun" today all published summaries of the letter written by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on September 8.

"Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published an editorial today entitled "The Sino-Indian Border Issue Must and Can Be Resolved Peacefully." The editorial excerpts are as follows:

On September 8, Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, replied to the letter from Indian Prime Minister Nehru in March regarding the Sino-Indian border issue.

Premier Zhou Enlai's letter once again truthfully demonstrates the sincerity of the peaceful foreign policy consistently followed by the People's Republic of China since the first day of its founding for the sake of peace in Asia and the world. The Korean people fully support this peace-loving position of the Chinese government.

The Chinese government's position and suggestions are the most just and reasonable way to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute and are in the interests of the people of both countries, as well as the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

The Sino-Indian border, stretching over two thousand kilometers, has never been formally demarcated. However, the Chinese government regards the Sino-Indian border as a border of friendship and strictly abides by the existing situation. Even in the case of repeated invasions of Chinese territory by Indian troops, it has handled it in a friendly manner and has made sincere efforts to continue the friendship between the two countries.

The situation on the Sino-Indian border became tense only after Tibetan rebels fled to India, and Indian troops crossed the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border and began to gradually invade Chinese territory. Therefore, the Indian side should bear full responsibility.

The Indian troops unilaterally changed the long-existing status quo of the Sino-Indian border, and even crossed the so-called "McMahon Line," which they claim as the Indian border, and invaded Chinese territory.

As is well known, even this McMahon Line was arbitrarily stipulated by British imperialism as part of its policy of aggression against the Tibet region of China when it ruled India. It is an illegal boundary that has not been recognized by any central government of China.

Indian troops not only crossed this McMahon Line and carried out armed firing on Chinese border defense forces, but also protected armed Tibetan rebels in several areas of Chinese territory they have forcibly occupied.

This cannot but be regarded as an illegal infringement on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity by India, which still maintains friendly relations with the People's Republic of China based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and cannot but be regarded as interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. In fact, this is an event that is difficult for the People's Republic of China to tolerate.

Even so, the People's Republic of China has once again proposed a peaceful solution to the problem with a spirit of consultation in order not to harm the traditional friendly relations with India and not to harm the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

This position of the Chinese government will be praised by all peace-loving people in Asia and the world.

In its reply, the Chinese government hopes that the Indian government will withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have invaded the Chinese border and immediately take measures to restore the long-existing situation on the border between the two countries.

We believe that the Indian government should also, like the Chinese government, immediately respond to the Chinese government's proposal with a friendly and correct attitude.

Our peace-loving people cannot but note with concern that when a dispute over the border issue has arisen between China and India, the two countries that pioneered the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and set an example in their implementation, the imperialist aggressive bloc has seized this opportunity and launched harassment activities in order to use this opportunity to achieve its sinister aggressive goals.

Western countries, especially the American aggressive bloc, want to take this opportunity to create discord between the two largest, friendly, and peace-loving countries in Asia and profit from it. The Sino-Indian border dispute should be resolved satisfactorily as soon as possible in order to eliminate the gap that the common enemy of the Asian people—the imperialist aggressive bloc—uses to endanger peace and the interests of the Asian people. Now that the Chinese government has proposed a peaceful solution to the border dispute to the Indian government with the utmost sincerity, it is time for the Indian government to take friendly measures with sincerity.

It seems that the Indian government is exerting pressure on China through military, diplomatic, and public opinion in order to make the Sino-Indian border, which has not yet been formally demarcated, unilaterally favorable to it.

However, it is clear that any pressure or method applied to the great socialist power—the People's Republic of China—will never succeed; on the contrary, it will complicate the situation and harm the interests of the people of both countries.

India, because it does not participate in aggressive military blocs, advocates the use of peaceful negotiations to resolve all disputes, and supports the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, has been trusted by the people of the world.

We believe that India will not forget this fact, and there is no reason to withdraw from the correct position that has been proven by history.

The Sino-Indian border issue can and must be resolved through peaceful and friendly talks between the two sides.

This is the unanimous wish of all peace-loving people in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 11th – The Polish newspaper "Youth Banner" today published a commentary on the Sino-Indian border incident, saying that the Sino-Indian border issue has aroused great clamor in Western newspapers and right-wing Indian newspapers.

The commentary pointed out that the right wing in India is inciting the border issue in newspapers and parliament. They are slandering China in newspapers for "aggression" and wanting to annex countries such as Bhutan and Sikkim. The purpose of the Indian right wing in launching this movement is to oppose the friendly and good-neighborly relations between China and India and to oppose the neutral policy pursued by the Indian government. Their purpose is also to oppose the Indian Communist Party, as a continuation of the Kerala incident.

The commentary said that Western newspapers, especially American newspapers, are trying to use this incident to worsen the international atmosphere before the Khrushchev-Eisenhower meeting.

The commentary pointed out that the Sino-Indian border in the Himalayas has never been formally demarcated. In the past, colonialists had drawn the Sino-Indian border into Chinese territory, but the Chinese government at that time did not accept this so-called "McMahon Line," and subsequent Chinese governments have never recognized this matter.

The commentary finally expressed the hope that the governments of China and India will resolve this issue through friendly negotiations.

Polish central newspapers such as "People's Tribune," "Warsaw Life," "Labor Voice," and "Youth Banner" published summaries of Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on September 8 regarding the Sino-Indian border issue on the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 11th – The Iraqi newspaper "Voice of Free Men" published an article on the Sino-Indian border issue entitled "Enemies of Sino-Indian Friendship," condemning the anti-China clamor of imperialism and reactionaries on this matter.

The article said that the slanderous remarks of imperialists and reactionaries against the People's China, such as "aggressiveness" and "colonialism," are too numerous. They have been talking about fabricated Chinese troop "gatherings." What is even worse is that the reactionaries in India organized demonstrations against the People's China, demanding "independence" for Tibet, although Mr. Nehru has said more than once that Tibet is Chinese territory. The article said, "The Sino-Indian border issue used to be a source of conflict, but the establishment of the People's Republic of China has brought a peaceful atmosphere to the common border. Nehru has said more than once that since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the border issue has been eased for the first time."

The article said, "Zhou Enlai's letter to Nehru draws attention to how dangerous the activities of those who advocate spreading seeds of discord between these two friendly countries are." The article also quoted Nehru as saying that an outbreak of division between China and India would mean a tragedy for Asia and Africa.

The article pointed out that the Tibetan rebels who fled to India, settled on the border, and began to provoke the People's China are being helped by the Indian People's Socialist Party and other reactionary forces.

The article emphasized that "the border issue needs to be resolved. The Sino-Indian border stretches for two thousand kilometers, but it has not been demarcated."

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表评论
    中印边境事件应由印度负完全责任
    波兰和伊拉克报纸谴责帝国主义和反动派反华叫嚣
    据新华社平壤11日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”、“民主朝鲜报”和“平壤新闻”今天都摘要刊载了中国周恩来总理在9月8日写给印度总理尼赫鲁的信件。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表了题为“中印边界问题必须而且能够和平解决”的社论。社论摘要如下：
    中华人民共和国周恩来总理在9月8日就中印边界问题，写回信答复印度总理尼赫鲁在3月间的来信。
    周恩来总理的信又一次如实地证明了中华人民共和国从建国的第一天起，就为了亚洲和世界和平一贯遵循的爱好和平的外交政策的真挚性。朝鲜人民完全支持充满和平愿望的中国政府的这一立场。
    中国政府的立场和建议是解决中印间边界争端问题的最正当合理的办法，并且是符合两国人民的利益以及亚洲和世界和平的利益的。
    中印间长达二千多公里的边界从未正式划定过。但是，中国政府把中印边界视为友谊的边界，严格地遵守了现有状况；在印度军队屡次侵犯中国领土的情况下，也以友好的做法处理了它，为了两国的友谊继续做了有诚意的努力。
    中印国境的局势是从西藏叛乱分子逃到印度后，印度军队越过中印边界的东段，并且开始逐步侵入中国领土时才紧张起来的，因此，应该由印度方面负完全责任。
    印度军队片面地改变了早已存在的中印边界状况，甚至越过了他们主张作为印度国境的所谓“麦克马洪线”，侵入中国领土。
    如所周知，就连这条麦克马洪线也是英帝国主义统治印度时作为侵略中国西藏地区的政策的一部分而任意规定的，它是并没有得到中国的任何一个中央政府承认过的非法界线。
    印度军队不仅越过了这条麦克马洪线，对中国边防部队进行了武装射击，还在他们强占的中国领土的几个地区内保护了武装的西藏叛乱分子。
    这不能不被认为是根据和平共处五项原则至今仍同中华人民共和国保持友好关系的印度对中国的主权和领土完整的非法侵犯，也不能不被认为是对中华人民共和国内部事务的干涉。事实上，这是使中华人民共和国难以容忍的事件。
    虽然如此，中华人民共和国这次再次以协商的心地，为了不损害同印度的传统的友好关系，为了不损害亚洲和世界和平的利益，提出了和平解决问题的办法。
    中国政府的这种立场将受到亚洲和世界一切爱好和平人民的赞扬。
    中国政府在它的回信中希望印度政府撤回侵犯中国边界的印度军队和行政人员，立即采取措施恢复两国边界久已存在的状况。
    我们认为，印度政府也应该同中国政府一样，以友好的正当的态度立即回答中国政府的建议。
    我们爱好和平的人民不能不关切地注意到：首创和平共处五项原则、并在执行中树立了榜样的中印两国之间发生边界问题的争端的时候，帝国主义侵略集团抓住这个机会，为了利用这个机会达到它的阴险的侵略目的，展开了骚扰活动。
    西方国家，特别是美国侵略集团，想借此机会在亚洲的两个最大的、友好的、爱好和平的国家间制造不和，而从中获得渔翁之利。中印间的边界争端问题应该早日获得圆满解决，以此来消除亚洲人民共同的敌人——帝国主义侵略集团借以危害和平和亚洲人民利益的间隙。在中国政府已经以最大的诚意向印度政府提出和平解决边界争端的建议的现在，该是印度政府以诚意采取友好的措施的时候了。
    看来，印度政府为了使尚未正式划定的中印边界片面地对它有利，正在通过军事、外交和社会舆论对中国施加着压力。
    但是，很明显，对伟大的社会主义大国——中华人民共和国所施加的任何压力和方法都决不能成功，反而会使局势复杂化，同时损害两国人民的利益。
    印度，由于没有参加侵略性的军事集团，主张用和平谈判的方法解决一切争端，支持不同社会制度的国家间的和平共处原则，才受到世界人民的信任。
    我们认为，印度将不会忘掉这个事实，并没有任何理由退出已被历史证实了的正当的立场。
    中印边界问题能够而且必须通过双方的和平和友好的会谈来加以解决。
    这是亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平人民的一致的愿望。
    新华社华沙11日电　波兰“青年旗帜报”今天就中印边界事件发表评论说，中印边界问题在西方报纸和印度右翼的报纸上引起了很大的叫嚣。
    评论指出，印度的右派在报纸上和议会就边界问题进行煽动。他们在报纸上污蔑中国进行“侵略”并想吞并不丹和锡金等国家。印度右派煽起这一运动的目的在于反对中印两国间的友好善邻关系，反对印度政府所奉行的中立政策。他们的目的还在于反对印度共产党，以作为喀拉拉邦事件的继续。
    评论说，西方报纸，特别是美国报纸则企图利用这一事件，使赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔会见前的国际气氛恶化。
    评论指出，中印两国在喜马拉雅山一带的边界从未正式划定。过去殖民主义者曾把中印边界划到中国领土以内，当时的中国政府就没有接受这条所谓的“麦克马洪线”，以后的中国政府也没有承认过这件事。
    评论最后表示希望，中印两国政府将通过友好谈判的方式使这一问题得到解决。
    “人民论坛报”、“华沙生活报”、“劳动之声报”、“青年旗帜报”等波兰中央报纸10日都刊登了周恩来总理8日就中印边界问题给印度总理尼赫鲁的复信的摘要。
    新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克“自由人之声报”就中印边界问题发表一篇题为“中印友谊的敌人”的文章，谴责帝国主义和反动派在这件事情上的反华叫嚣。
    文章说，帝国主义者和反动派对人民中国发出的所谓“侵略成性”和“殖民主义”的胡说是太多了。他们一直在谈论捏造的中国军队“集结”的事情。更甚的是，印度的反动派组织了反对人民中国的示威，要求西藏“独立”，虽然尼赫鲁先生不止一次说过，西藏是中国的领土。文章说，“中印边界问题过去是引起冲突的根源，但是中华人民共和国的成立使（中印）共同边境上笼罩着平静的气氛。尼赫鲁不止一次说过，自从中华人民共和国成立以来，边境问题第一次得到缓和。”
    文章说，“周恩来给尼赫鲁的信件使人们注意到主张在这两个友好国家间散布不和底种子的人所进行的活动是多么危险。”文章还引用尼赫鲁的话说，中印之间爆发分歧对亚洲和非洲将意味着一个悲剧。
    文章指出，逃往印度、定居于边境并且开始对人民中国挑衅的西藏叛乱分子，得到印度人民社会党和其他反动势力的帮助。
    文章强调说，“边境问题需要解决。中印边界延绵两千公里，但是没有定界。”
