Xinhua News Agency, 6th: By the 6th, all 29 delegations participating in the First National Games, composed of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and the Tibetan region, had arrived in Beijing one after another.

　　This National Games is a "gathering of heroes" in the history of Chinese sports. The more than 10,000 male and female athletes participating in the competitions and performances are strong contenders selected from tens of millions of people from the bottom up. Among them are 640 master athletes, 2,714 first-class athletes, including world record holders, creators of the latest world records, and world champions. The representation of these athletes is also extremely broad. They include workers, farmers, officers, soldiers, students, staff, and nurses; advanced producers, combat heroes, "three good" students, and activists in socialist construction; there are elderly people in their sixties and young children of nine years old. The athletes include more than 20 ethnic groups, including Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Zhuang, Uygur, Tu, Korean, Miao, Gaoshan, Yi, Xibe, Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Daur, Dai, Lisu, Uzbek, Buyi, Russian, Chuanqing, and Dong; this National Games can also be said to be a grand gathering of heroic sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in our country.

　　The strength of each delegation participating in this National Games is quite strong. The People's Liberation Army sports delegation is composed of 400 elites selected from 5,000 athletes in the entire army sports meet, including 100 master athletes and more than 130 first-class athletes. In particular, many famous athletes in national defense sports are in the PLA delegation. The Beijing Municipal delegation's basketball, table tennis, and track and field teams are among the strongest in our country. The women's basketball team has eight master athletes, and they have formed the national team to visit foreign countries many times. In the table tennis team, Wang Chuanyao, Jiang Yongning, Zhuang Jiafu, Qiu Zhonghui, Ye Peiqiong, and Sun Meiying, who are famous throughout the country, are all in their team. In the Shanghai sports delegation's table tennis team, there is Yang Ruihua, who entered the top eight in the 25th World Table Tennis Championships, Xu Yinsheng, who defeated the 1958 Japanese national champion Shizuka Narita, and Li Furong, who won the runner-up in the table tennis competition of the 7th Youth Festival. Tennis players Mei Fuji and Zhu Banhua are both champions and runners-up in national competitions over the years. Recently, they won the men's doubles championship in the international tennis tournament held in Sopot, Poland. The Hebei delegation has Mu Xiangxiong, the world record creator for the men's 100-meter breaststroke, and Zhao Qingkui, the world record creator for the light heavyweight snatch. The Shandong delegation's track and field team has national record holders Zheng Fengrong, Li Zhonglin, and Bi Hongfu. The Guangdong delegation has the strongest strength in water sports, with 20 master athletes among the 54 athletes participating in swimming, diving, and water polo. The Inner Mongolia delegation, which is known for its equestrian, archery, and wrestling skills, will also show its skills at the Games.

　　What is even more gratifying is that workers and farmers have sent their own representatives to participate in this sports event. According to statistics from the Games headquarters, 1,089 athletes were selected from workers and farmers, and 58% of the athletes in the Tibet delegation were from farming backgrounds. Among these many athletes, there are twin sisters Chen Guide and Chen Guili from Sichuan Province, who are both gymnastics master athletes. In the swimming pool, there will be a pair of sisters, Liu Yusen and Liu Lisen, competing. On the table tennis scene, there will be two pairs of brothers competing. One pair is Zhou Lansun and Zhou Shusen, and the other pair is Wu Xiaode and Wu Xiaoming. These phenomena fully reflect the depth and breadth of the development of sports in our country. These athletes, who are full of fighting spirit and ambition, have been eager to try and strive for a double harvest in politics and technology after arriving in Beijing.

    各族运动健儿大团聚
    参加全运会的29个代表团全部到京
    新华社6日讯　到6日止，参加第一届全国运动会的中国人民解放军和各首、市、自治区以及西藏地方所组成的二十九个代表团，已全部陆续到达北京。
    这次全运会是我国体育史上的一次“群英会”。参加竞赛和表演的一万多名男女运动员，是从下而上在数千万人当中精益求精选拔出来的强手。其中有六百四十名运动健将、两千七百一十四名一级运动员，他们中有的是世界纪录、世界最新成绩创造者和世界冠军。这些运动员的代表性也极为广泛。其中有工人、农民、军官、战士、学生、职员、护士；有先进生产者、战斗英雄、“三好”学生、社会主义建设积极分子；有六十多岁的老人，有九岁的少年儿童。运动员中包括汉、满、蒙古、回、藏、僮、维吾尔、土、朝鲜、苗、高山、彝、锡伯、柯尔克孜、哈萨克、达斡尔、傣、傈僳、乌孜别克、布依、俄罗斯、穿青、侗等二十多个民族；这次全运会又可以说是我国各兄弟民族英雄儿女的大会师。
    参加这次全运会的各代表团的实力都相当雄厚。人民解放军体育代表团是在全军运动会上从五千名运动员中选拔的四百名精锐，其中有健将百员、一级运动员一百三十多名，特别是在国防体育项目上，我国许多著名的运动员都在解放军代表团里。北京市代表团的篮球、乒乓球、田径等队是我国较强的队。女篮队里有八名健将，多次以她们为主组成国家队出国访问。乒乓球队里，全国驰名的名将王传耀、姜永宁、庄家富、丘钟惠、叶珮琼、孙梅英等都在他们队里。上海市体育代表团的乒乓球队中有进入第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛前八名的杨瑞华，有打败过1958年日本全国冠军成田静司的徐寅生，有获得第七届青年联欢节乒乓球赛亚军的李富荣。网球运动员梅福基和朱板华都是历年全国比赛的冠、亚军，最近他们在波兰索波特举行的国际网球赛中，荣获男子双打冠军。河北代表团拥有男子一百米蛙泳世界纪录创造者穆祥雄和轻重量级双手挺举世界纪录创造者赵庆奎。山东代表团田径队里拥有全国纪录保持者郑凤荣、李忠林、毕鸿福。水上运动实力最强的是广东代表团，参加游泳、跳水、水球比赛的五十四名运动员中就有二十员健将。素以马术、射箭、摔跤为长的内蒙古代表团也将在运动会上一显身手。
    更可喜的是，工人、农民都派出了自己的代表参加了这次运动大会。据大会指挥部统计，从工人、农民中选拔出的运动员就有一千零八十九名，西藏代表团的运动员58％都是农民出身。在这众多的运动员中还有四川省一对孪生姐妹陈贵德和陈贵立都是体操健将，在游泳池里，将有一双姐妹——柳玉森和柳立森争雄，在乒乓球坛上将有两对兄弟比武。一对是周兰荪和周树森，一对是吴小德和吴小明。这些现象都充分反映了我国体育运动开展的深入和广泛性。这些战志昂扬、雄心勃勃的运动员们，到达北京后，都已跃跃欲试，争取政治、技术双丰收。
