Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: Zhang Yuncheng, a 28-year-old athlete from a poor peasant family in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and runner-up in last year's National Marathon Championships, won the marathon race of the First National Games this morning with a time of two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-five and eight-tenths seconds.

Today, in this most arduous track and field event of forty-two kilometers and one hundred and ninety-five meters, the athletes from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a great advantage. They took three places in the top eight. In addition to Zhang Yuncheng, Zheng Zhaoxin, the champion of last year's National Marathon Championships, won the second place with a time of two hours, thirty-five minutes, thirty-eight and six-tenths seconds. He was overtaken by Zhang Yuncheng after running thirty kilometers due to leg cramps. Liu Yuxiang, a 21-year-old cadre from the Hailar Finance Bureau, took sixth place with a time of two hours, forty minutes, and thirty-eight seconds. This young athlete only started practicing marathon last October, and today was his first time participating in a national competition.

Two newcomers from Guizhou, who were also participating in a national competition for the first time, performed very well today. Zhang Shiqing, a 20-year-old middle school student from a tenant farmer family in Bijie County, won the third place, and Cheng Zhengkuan, a 27-year-old cadre from Puding County, won the fourth place, with times of two hours, thirty-seven minutes, forty-four and two-tenths seconds and two hours, forty minutes, three and eight-tenths seconds respectively. They overtook many experienced athletes in the last three kilometers to become the second group of leaders.

Chen Tongbin from Jilin won the fifth place, Zhong Ermin from Guangxi won the seventh place, and Meng Guangxian from the People's Liberation Army won the eighth place. Li Cunye from Yunnan, You Yunting from Shandong, Cui Shiyi from Shanxi, and Zhang Xiling from Liaoning, who were the third to sixth place winners in last year's National Marathon Championships, did not achieve top rankings.

    今天，在这项长达四十二公里一百九十五米的最艰苦的田径比赛中，内蒙古自治区选手占了很大优势。前八名中，他们取得了三个名次。除张云程外，去年全国马拉松锦标赛冠军郑昭信获得亚军，成绩是两小时三十五分三十八秒六，他是在跑完三十公里后因为腿部抽筋，才被张云程赶过去的。海拉尔财政局二十一岁的干部刘玉祥取得第六名，成绩两小时四十分三十八秒。这位年轻的选手去年10月才开始练习马拉松，今天是他第一次参加全国性比赛。
    贵州的两名第一次参加全国性比赛的新手今天跑得也很出色。其中毕节县佃农出身二十岁的中学生张世清得了第三名，普定县二十七岁的机关干部程正宽得了第四名，成绩分别是两小时三十七分四十四秒二和两小时四十分三秒八。他们是在最后三千米处才赶过许多老手而成为第二批领先者的。
    获得第五名的是吉林陈桐彬，第七名是广西钟尔敏，第八名是解放军孟广贤。去年全国马拉松锦标赛第三名到第六名的选手——云南李存业、山东酉云亭、山西崔世一、辽宁张希苓都没有取得优胜名次。（附图片）
