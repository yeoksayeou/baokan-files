Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. Following the Iraqi government's execution on the 20th of a group of traitors involved in the Shawwaf rebellion, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has unleashed a new high tide of attacks against Iraq. On the 23rd, a group of organized students in Cairo held a demonstration. The demonstrators carried banners and empty coffins, shouting slogans such as "Long live the heroes of nationalism," "Baghdad, rise up in revolt," and "Down with the Iraqi executioner, Qasim!"

The Cairo newspaper "Al-Ahram" alarmingly incited on the 23rd that Iraq was "boiling" due to the execution of these traitors. The Cairo newspaper "Al-Akhbar" claimed on the 21st that it would "arrest that butcher who rules Iraq, that man perched atop corpses, that man who orders the killing of Iraqi revolutionary leaders and takes pleasure in bloodshed."

Many cities in the Syrian region organized demonstrations on the 22nd to oppose Iraq's execution of the traitors. Damascus organized a mass rally on this day to "condemn the barbaric massacre of the executioner Qasim." The rally sent telegrams to the heads of various Arab states, demanding that an Arab heads of state conference be held in a short period of time in order to "formulate a sacred national charter to combat communism and its dangers, and to implement this charter with an attitude that liberates Iraq from this terrible danger, thereby saving the entire Arab nation and the Arab countries." The rally also sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, requesting that this issue, which completely belongs to Iraq's internal affairs, be "studied" at the United Nations General Assembly session.

On the rostrum of the rally hung a huge UAE flag and two former Iraqi flags, surrounded by black ribbons. The rally observed a moment of silence for the executed traitors of Iraq. After the meeting, some attendees carried empty coffins covered with the old Iraqi flag in a demonstration.

All newspapers and radio stations in Damascus on the 23rd devoted considerable space and time to publicizing the news of these anti-Iraq demonstrations. "Al-Wahda" newspaper clamored that "everywhere in the cities and villages of the Syrian region, there are demands for retaliation."

    阿联掀起反伊拉克新高潮
    开罗等地组织游行集会攻击卡塞姆
    新华社24日讯　在伊拉克政府于20日处决了一批参加沙瓦夫叛乱事件的叛国罪犯以后，阿联掀起了一个攻击伊拉克的新高潮。23日，一批被组织起来的开罗学生举行了示威游行。示威者抬着标语和空棺材，高叫“民族主义的英雄万岁”，“巴格达起来反抗”和“打倒伊拉克的刽子手卡塞姆”等口号。
    开罗“金字塔报”23日耸人听闻地煽动说，伊拉克由于处决这批叛国罪犯而“沸腾了起来”。开罗“消息报”在21日则声称要“逮捕统治伊拉克的那个屠夫、那个高踞在死尸上面的人，那个下令杀害伊拉克革命领袖而以流血为娱乐的人。”
    叙利亚地区许多城市在22日都组织了示威游行，反对伊拉克处决叛国罪犯。大马士革在这天组织了一次群众大会，“谴责刽子手卡塞姆的野蛮的屠杀”。大会打电报给各阿拉伯国家的首脑，要求在短时期内举行一次阿拉伯国家首脑会议，以便“制订一项打击共产主义及其危险的神圣的民族宪章，并且以使伊拉克摆脱这种可怕的危险从而拯救整个阿拉伯民族和阿拉伯国家的态度来实现这个宪章。”大会还致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求在联合国大会会议上“研究”这个完全属于伊拉克内政的问题。
    在大会的主席台上张挂着一面巨大的阿联国旗和两面伊拉克以前的国旗，旗子的周围围着黑色的带子。大会为伊拉克的被处决的叛国罪犯默哀。一些到会的人在会后抬着复盖着伊拉克旧国旗的空棺材，举行了示威游行。
    大马士革所有报纸和电台23日都用了很大的篇幅和时间宣传这些反伊游行的消息。“统一报”叫嚷说，“在叙利亚地区城市和乡村，到处都要求进行报复”。
