    Handshake is a Crime
    Draft of a Notice from a School in Des Moines
            Chi Bei'ou
    Western news agencies report: Four sixteen-year-old female students in Des Moines, USA, were indefinitely suspended from school for welcoming Khrushchev and shaking his hand. Although the government has no explicit orders, officials have long been cautioning: (Note) When receiving Soviet guests, strictly prohibit expressing enthusiasm. Four female students from our school dared to violate the regulations and went to welcome Khrushchev upon his arrival. Khrushchev's two palms are covered with communist germs, and they actually shook them, surely they have been infected. Even if they are not pro-Soviet, they still want peace and friendship; such dangerous elements should be expelled to prevent future troubles. Our school has always valued freedom and treated students with leniency. They can refrain from talking about politics but can indulge in drugs and alcohol; they are allowed to fight in groups, but forbidden to shake hands casually. Anyone who deviates from the "right path" will be severely punished without leniency.
    Note: American news agencies have reported that when Khrushchev arrived in Washington, Eisenhower kept a "straight face," implying that the welcome from the masses should be "restrained."

    握手有罪
    拟得梅因市某校布告
            池北偶
    西方通讯社报道：美国得梅因市四个十六岁的女学生因为去欢迎赫鲁晓夫并同他握了手，被学校无限期地停学。政府虽无明令，官方早已叮咛：（注）接待苏联来客，严禁表露热情。本校女生四名，胆敢违犯规定，赫鲁晓夫到境，擅自前往欢迎。赫氏两只手掌，共产细菌沾满，彼等竟然握过，一定已受传染。即使未必亲苏，也想和平友善，此等危险分子，开除以绝后患。本校素重自由，对待学生宽厚。嘴巴勿谈政治，但可吸毒酗酒；允许聚众打架，但禁随便握手。凡舍“正路”不由，一律严惩不宥。
    注：美国通讯社曾报道说，赫鲁晓夫抵华盛顿之日，艾森豪威尔一直“绷着脸”，是暗示群众欢迎要“有节制”。
