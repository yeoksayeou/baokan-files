Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, September 1st: The first plane loaded with new US military aid to the Royal Lao Armed Forces arrived in Vientiane via Bangkok on August 31.

It is said that this batch of military aid consists of 2,640 pairs of Japanese-made military shoes. Officials in charge of military aid revealed that these military shoes will be used to support the Royal Armed Forces engaged in the civil war in northern Laos. Another batch of military shoes will be shipped soon.

Other equipment provided under the "emergency aid" decided by the US government on August 26 to the Sananikone government - including small arms, military uniforms, etc. - are scheduled to be transported by plane later.

The "Civil Air Transport" of the Chiang gang is carrying the US military aid, and more planes are expected to arrive in Vientiane later this week.

The news indicates that the United States is using Japan as a logistical base for its trampling on the Geneva Accords and escalating the Lao civil war. At the same time, Bangkok is being used by the United States as a transit station for supplying military aid to Laos.

    公然为扩大老挝内战火上浇油
    美国空运军援物资到老挝
    新华社1日讯　万象消息：第一架满载美国对老挝王国部队新的军事援助的飞机8月31日经曼谷到达万象。
    据说这一批军援物资是二千六百四十双日本制造的军用鞋子。负责军事援助事务的官员透露，这批军鞋将用来支援在老挝北部进行内战的王国军队。另一批军鞋随后即将运来。
    根据美国政府8月26日决定给予萨纳尼空政府的“紧急援助”提供的其他装备——包括小型武器、军服等，预定以后再用飞机运来。
    承运美国军援物资的是蒋帮“民航空运公司”，预定本星期晚些时候将有更多的飞机到达万象。
    消息表明，美国正在利用日本作为它践踏日内瓦协议扩大老挝内战的后勤基地。同时，曼谷正在被美国用来作为供应老挝军援物资的转运站。
