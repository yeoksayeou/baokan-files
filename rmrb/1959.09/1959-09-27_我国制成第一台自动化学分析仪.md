Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th: One of the major products of the Materials Research Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical Manufacturing and Process Science of the First Ministry of Machine Building to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a fully automated, multiple-function, ultra-fast automatic chemical analyzer, has recently been successfully developed. This chemical analyzer can simultaneously analyze nine elements—manganese, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, chromium, copper, titanium, vanadium, and molybdenum—in pig iron, ordinary steel, and low-alloy steel in just over eight minutes. Technical appraisal has now determined that this chemical analyzer has enormous significance for both science and technology and industrial production.

The analyzer, which is about one and a half meters high and one meter wide and shaped like an "L," does not appear complex on the outside. The outside of the cabinet houses its main component—the chemical reaction section; the bottom and rear house the auxiliary components—the electrical control and gas and liquid extraction sections. However, it almost completely replaces the work of a general metal chemical analysis laboratory. To analyze pig iron, various ordinary steels, low-alloy steels, etc., one only needs to place the metal sample into a specific container, turn on the switch, and it will automatically perform a series of complex chemical analysis tasks: dissolving the steel sample, adding various reagents according to prescribed dosages, performing chemical reactions, separating liquids, and finally developing colors, presenting different shades of color in each glass measuring tube. Combining this with a photometer allows for accurate reading of the content of various elements in the sample, thereby determining the properties of the metal material. Hundreds of complex chemical analysis operations are carried out automatically in an orderly manner, requiring only one person to manage. Including the automatic washing of the instrument, the entire process takes only a little over eight minutes. The accuracy of the analysis fully meets the requirements of industrial production and laboratories.

Analytical chemistry has a history of two hundred years and has long been done manually. For example, analyzing ordinary low-alloy steel in an analysis lab requires three people and takes about an hour, including preparation and cleaning of equipment afterwards. Sometimes, incorrect analysis results can affect the quality of the steel. In particular, furnace-front analysis in smelting plants is often slow, affecting correct material input and timely tapping of steel. The ultra-fast automatic chemical analyzer can change this situation.

In recent years, China's socialist construction has advanced by leaps and bounds at an unprecedented speed. The metallurgical industry and the mechanical manufacturing industry both require the rapid provision of ultra-fast analysis and testing instruments. The Materials Research Institute began research on the automation of ultra-fast chemical analysis as early as 1956. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, to complete this research work earlier, a chemical analysis automation research group was established. Building on the already successful metal ultra-fast analysis method and ultra-speed basic processing method, they developed a preliminary automatic analyzer before last year's National Day that could analyze three elements—manganese, silicon, and phosphorus—in ordinary steel in four to five minutes. On this basis, this year, under the leadership of the Party, the researchers continued to exert their energy and, after countless failures, finally produced China's first multi-functional ultra-fast automatic chemical analyzer.

    我国制成第一台自动化学分析仪
    据新华社上海24日电　第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院材料研究所向建国十周年献礼的主要产品之一、一台完全自动化的复能式特快自动化学分析仪在最近研究制成。这台化学分析仪可以供生铁、普通钢、低合金钢三类金属在八分多钟内同时分析锰、硅、磷、镍、铬、铜、钛、钒、钼九种元素。现经技术鉴定，这台化学分析仪在科学技术上和工业生产上有着巨大意义。
    这台高约一米半、宽约一米成“L”形的柜状分析仪，外表看来并不复杂；柜的外面是它的主要部分——化学反应部分；底部和后面是辅助部分——电器控制和导气抽液部分，但是它几乎代替了一般金属化学分析室的全部工作。用它分析生铁、各种普通钢、低合金钢等，只需要把金属样品往特定的容器里一放，开动电钮，它就会自动的进行一系列复杂的化学分析工作：溶解钢样，按照规定的用量添加各种试剂，进行化学反应，分液，最后显色，在各个玻璃的量管里，呈现出不同深浅的颜色。配合光度计即可准确地读出样品中各种元素的含量，并且从而决定金属材料的性能。百十道复杂的化学分析工作按部就班自动进行，只需要一个人管理，连仪器自动洗涤在内，全部过程只有八分多钟。分析的精确程度，完全合于工业生产和实验室的要求。
    分析化学至今有二百年的历史，长期以来一直是手工操作。如一般的低合金钢在分析室分析，三个人做，连事先准备和事后器具洗涤在内，前后要一小时，有时还会由于分析结果不正确而影响钢的质量。特别是冶炼厂的炉前分析，常因分析缓慢，影响正确投料和及时出钢。有了特快自动化学分析仪即可改变这种状况。
    近几年来，我国的社会主义建设，以史无前例的速度飞跃前进，冶金工业、机械制造工业都要求迅速提供特快的分析检验仪表。材料研究所早在1956年即开始对特快化学分析自动化的研究，在1958年全民大跃进中为了提早完成这项研究工作，成立了化学分析自动化研究组，并且在已经研究成功的金属特快分析法及超速基本处理法的基础上，在去年国庆节前研究制成了一台初级的、能在四、五分钟内分析普通钢中的锰、硅、磷三种元素的自动分析仪。在这基础上，今年研究人员们在党的领导下，继续鼓足干劲，经过无数次失败，终于制成了我国第一台复能式特快自动化学分析仪。
