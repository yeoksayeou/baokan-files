Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th: Shandong Province's coal mines exceeded their production plan for the first six days of September by 1.23%, with an average daily output of 62,004 tons, which is 1.6% higher than the average daily output from August 26th to 31st.

　　Inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee, Shandong Province's coal production army launched a coal-grabbing campaign, vigorously promoted advanced experiences such as cyclic operations and lengthened coal cutting machines, enthusiastically carried out emulation drives, and devised various methods to overcome difficulties. After promoting advanced experiences of parallel operations and cyclic drilling, the tunneling progress of the tunneling zone of the Xinwen Liangzhuang Coal Mine increased from 41 meters to 46.9 meters per day. When the Shi Shaoxiang coal mining team of the Xiazhuang Coal Mine of the Zibo Mining Bureau encountered a fault and the combine could not load coal, they used manual coal winding, resulting in the completion of the daily plan with an excess of 88 tons of raw coal.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th: In the first five days of the decisive battle in September, Shanxi Province's coal mine workers created new achievements. From the 1st to the 5th, the output of state-owned coal mines in the province exceeded the plan by 18,940 tons, an increase of 7.9% compared to the same period in August, and the average daily output for the five days increased by 9.6% compared to the average daily output in August; the daily output of local state-owned coal mines also increased by 21.5% compared to the same period in August.

　　Shanxi Province's coal mine workers responded to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions, determined to complete the September plan three days ahead of schedule. These days, they have been full of energy, chasing after each other, and the outcomes of the emulation drives have been alternating. The workers of the Jia class of the Qiligou mine of the Ximing Mine in the Xishan Coal Mine, which was rated as the "ever-victorious class" in August, produced 608 tons of coal on September 1st; the workers of the Yi and Bing classes rose up to catch up, with the Yi class producing 612 tons of coal on the 1st, exceeding the "ever-victorious class", and exceeding the Jia class again on the 2nd and 3rd with 650 tons and 708 tons. The Jia class workers further boosted their efforts and produced 733 tons of coal on the 4th, taking the lead again. All the workers in the mine chased after each other in this way, exceeding the plan for the first five days of September by 1.5%. The Datong Coal Mine produced 15,300 tons of raw coal more in these five days.

    煤炭日产量直线上升超额完成计划
    山东山西九月旗开得胜
    新华社济南8日电　山东省各煤矿9月份头六天的生产计划超额1.23％完成，平均日产量达到六万二千零四吨，比8月26至31日的平均日产量还高1.6％。
    山东省煤炭生产大军在党中央的伟大号召鼓舞下，展开了夺煤大战，大力推行循环作业和加长截煤机等先进经验，热烈开展了对手竞赛，并且想出各种办法克服困难。新汶良庄煤矿掘进一区在推广平行作业、循环打眼的先进经验后，掘进日进度由四十一米增加到四十六点九米。淄博矿务局夏庄煤矿石绍祥采煤队在一次遇到断层，康拜因不能装煤时，就用人工卷煤，结果超额八十八吨原煤完成了日计划。
    据新华社太原8日电　山西省各煤矿职工在决战9月的头五天，又创造了新的战绩。从1日到5日，全省国营煤矿的产量超过计划一万八千九百四十吨，比8月同期增长7.9％，五天的平均日产量比8月份的平均日产量提高9.6％；地方国营煤矿的日产量也比8月同期提高21.5％。
    山西省各煤矿职工以实际行动响应党中央的号召，决心提前三天完成9月份的计划。这几天，他们干劲充沛，你追我赶，对手竞赛的胜负交叉出现。西山煤矿8月份被评为“常胜班”的西铭矿七里沟坑甲班工人，9月1日产煤六百零八吨；乙、丙两班工人奋起追赶，乙班在1日产煤六百一十二吨，超过“常胜班”，2日和3日又以六百五十吨和七百零八吨的成绩超过甲班。甲班工人进一步大鼓干劲，在4日产煤七百三十三吨，再度领先。全矿职工都这样你追我赶，超额1.5％完成了9月头五天的计划。大同煤矿在这五天内多产了一万五千三百吨原煤。
