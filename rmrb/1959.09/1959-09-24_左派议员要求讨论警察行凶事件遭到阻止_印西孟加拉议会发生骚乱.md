Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 22nd: According to reports in the newspapers here, at the opening of the autumn session of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in Calcutta on the 21st, opposition party legislators requested a discussion of the recent incident in the state where police shot and killed eighty demonstrators during an anti-hunger, anti-price-increase movement. Congress Party legislators vehemently opposed this request. A riot broke out in the assembly hall.

At the opening of the meeting, opposition legislators from the Indian Communist Party and other left-wing parties wore black gauze on their clothing and proposed and stood for a moment of silence for those killed in the recent shootings. Legislators from the Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party shouted loudly in opposition.

The atmosphere in the hall became even more tense when Police and Defence Minister K. Mukerjee, in his speech, called the anti-hunger movement a "hooligan act," with desk thumping and shouting erupting all around. Subsequently, Congress Party and opposition legislators threw shoes, canes, and loudspeakers at each other, resulting in a melee and beatings. The Deputy Speaker was forced to announce a recess. After the meeting resumed, it still could not proceed normally and had to be hastily adjourned.

During the discussions, West Bengal Indian Communist Party leader Jyoti Basu, in proposing an emergency motion on the police shooting incident, firmly opposed the claim that the anti-hunger, anti-price-increase movement was illegal. Indian United Socialist Organization leader Su. Banerjee spoke, demanding the release of those arrested for participating in the anti-hunger, anti-price-increase movement. He pointed out that the recent events in Calcutta indicate the existence of "latent fascism" in India. It is reported that over 10,000 demonstrators protested the authorities' suppression outside the assembly hall while the parliament was in session. They cheered the opposition legislators who left the hall to speak to them.

    左派议员要求讨论警察行凶事件遭到阻止
    印西孟加拉议会发生骚乱
    据新华社新德里22日电　据这里的报纸报道：印度西孟加拉邦立法会议21日在加尔各答举行的秋季会议开幕时，反对党议员要求讨论最近邦内开展反饥饿反涨价运动中警察开枪打死八十名示威者的事件。国大党议员激烈反对这种要求。会场上发生了一场骚乱。
    在开会时，反对党印度共产党的和其它左派的议员在衣服上佩戴黑纱，建议并起立为最近的开枪事件中被打死的人默哀，国大党和人民社会党的议员大叫大嚷，表示反对。
    当警察和防卫部长卡·慕克吉在发言中把反饥饿运动叫作是“流氓行为”时，会场上的空气更为紧张，拍桌声、喊叫声响成一片。接着，国大党和反对党议员互掷皮鞋、手杖和扩音器，发生了一场混战和殴打。副议长只得宣布休会。复会后会议仍然不能正常进行，只得草草结束。
    在讨论时，西孟加拉邦印度共产党领袖乔·巴苏在就警察开枪事件提出临时动议时坚决反对反饥饿反涨价运动是违法行为的说法。印度统一社会主义组织的领袖苏·班纳吉发言要求释放由于参加反饥饿反涨价运动而被捕的人。他指出，最近在加尔各答发生的事件表明印度国内存在“潜在的法西斯主义”。据报道，在议会开会时，有一万多名示威者到会场外抗议当局的镇压行动。他们向离开会场对他们讲话的反对党议员欢呼。
