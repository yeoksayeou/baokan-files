The Determination of Hundreds of Millions of Peasants

    Launching a Competition to Increase Late Autumn Crops by 30,000 Mu
    Chengdu Jinniu Commune
    The vast number of commune members of the Jinniu Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, are determined to support the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions of simultaneous leaps forward in all production areas.

    After the commune members listened to the broadcast of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the evening of the 26th, they all felt that the Party expressed the sentiments of hundreds of millions of peasants. When the members of the seven production teams in the Ziyun Management Area held discussions, they regarded the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes as the driving force for progress and the source of happiness. Commune member Lai Yinguang said: This year, the commune's wheat production increased by more than 20%, and rapeseed production increased by more than 70%; although some of the autumn harvest crops suffered disasters, a good harvest is still expected. Without the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, this would not have been possible. The commune members of the Qiyi Vegetable Management Area used concrete facts to illustrate the unparalleled superiority of the commune. More than 7,000 mu of vegetables in this management area were flooded, but the commune drew 1,000 people from eight grain-based management areas to help remove the weeds, clearing 600 to 700 mu in one day, and re-sowed the vegetable seeds, so that new vegetables will be available on the market by the end of the year.

    The commune members had a particularly profound understanding of the "The third quarter is crucial. Every inch of time is precious" mentioned in the resolution. That night, many people automatically went to the fields to plow the land, increase the planting of late autumn crops and vegetables, and seize the opportunity to launch a concentrated effort. The commune Party committee re-discussed the commune's production plan overnight and revised this year's production targets. The commune plans to maintain last year's total grain output even if the area for rice cultivation is reduced by 10,000 mu and replaced with vegetables. The solutions are: to strengthen field management and increase yield per unit area, striving to make late rice catch up with mid-season rice; after rushing to harvest the 30,000 mu of mid-season rice, to increase the planting of a season of late autumn crops, ensuring the production of 80 million jin of vegetables within four months to supply the city. The variety of vegetables produced should be increased to meet the diverse needs of the city.

    This revised plan was enthusiastically approved by the commune members. All 19 management areas in the commune challenged and responded to each other, launching a heated socialist labor competition to complete this plan.

    Adding Measures to Increase Late Rice Production by Another 10 Million Jin
    Nanchang Jiangxiang Commune
    Commune members of the Jiangxiang Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, held meetings one after another, expressing their firm response to the call of the Party Central Committee and immediately launched a new upsurge in production.

    That night, the various production groups, production teams, and the vast number of commune members submitted more than 8,200 letters of determination to the Party branch of the management area and the Party committee of the commune. The commune Party committee also held an emergency meeting of the commune Party committee members, analyzed the current favorable conditions for production, revised the late rice production increase target, and decided to increase the total output of late rice from the original plan of 63.82 million jin to 78 million jin, and added six yield-increasing measures from the aspects of water, fertilizer, and field management.

    Through seminars and discussions, the production enthusiasm of the commune members became even higher. On the night they listened to the broadcast, more than 1,000 commune members of the Lianwei Management Area carried more than 400 waterwheels to the fields to fight drought, rescuing more than 100 mu of drought-stricken fields. The Chubei Brigade originally had more than 40 mu of land that could not be planted with late rice due to severe drought. After listening to the broadcast, the commune members immediately sowed buckwheat and sesame in the fields. On the 27th and 28th, the attendance rate of the entire commune reached 100% every day.

    Revising Plans to Increase Grain Production by Another 4.4 Million Jin
    Changge Pohu Commune
    On the evening of the 26th, the commune members of the Pohu People's Commune in Changge County, Henan Province, were delighted and informed each other when they heard the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC.

    According to the spirit of the resolution, the commune members discussed the commune's continued leap forward plan. According to the investigation and calculation, the main crop of sweet potatoes in the entire commune can still grow for 40 days, and late corn and other miscellaneous grain crops can still grow for 20 to 30 days. If attention is paid to increasing fertilizer, water, and management, there is great potential to increase output. The brigades plan: sweet potatoes will generally be fertilized twice more, and the vines will be turned and the soil will be cultivated in a timely manner; late corn will be fertilized once more, hoed one to two times, and pollinated, treated for pests, and pruned. It is required that corn yields be increased by another 50 jin per mu, tobacco leaves by another 50 jin per mu, and sweet potatoes by another 400 jin per mu. In this way, the entire commune will increase grain production by a total of 4.4 million jin.

    Striving to Achieve the Grain and Cotton Targets of the National Agricultural Development Program This Year
    Weinan Chengguan Commune
    Encouraged by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, the commune members of the Chengguan People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, held a 10,000-person oath-taking rally on the evening of the 26th to discuss and revise this year's grain and cotton production increase plans. They unanimously decided to immediately launch a fall field over-production movement from now on, striving to achieve the output targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program for grain, cotton, and other crops within this year. That night, Zhang Qiuxiang, a nationally renowned cotton planting expert who had returned from other places to impart experience, also led her work group to discuss issues such as revising targets and adding measures, proposing to water the cotton fields managed by the group one more time, apply fertilizer one more time, and engage in meticulous management and harvesting, so that each plant would increase by three peaches and each mu would increase cotton production by 70 jin, using this achievement to offer a gift to the National Day.

    Since its establishment, the Chengguan People's Commune in Weinan County has achieved great development in various production areas. In the first half of this year, the total industrial output value of the entire commune increased by 18.3% compared with the same period last year, and the total agricultural output value increased by 11%. The number of large livestock and pigs, sheep, and poultry raised has also increased.

    Now, encouraged by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, the commune members of this commune are all in high spirits and full of vigor, determined to strive to harvest 40 jin more grain per mu of fall fields and 10 jin more cotton per mu of cotton fields on the basis of the original production increase plan, so that they can reach the output targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The commune members acted as they spoke, and immediately threw themselves into the field management competition of rushing to apply fertilizer, rushing to water, and rushing for time. On the night of the oath-taking rally, the commune members of the Shuangwang Management Area started 13 powered water pumps and 503 waterwheels to water more than 600 mu of fall fields. After listening to the broadcast, the Dongwang Production Team of the Chengjia Management Area sent 100,000 jin of manure to the fields that night. The Xinzhuang and Chishui Production Teams of this management area, which had originally planned to jointly renovate a canal after planting wheat, also immediately started the renovation. After the joint effort of the two teams, it was completed in less than ten hours and has now begun to release water for irrigation.

    亿万农民的决心
    开展竞赛，增种晚秋作物三万亩成都
    金牛公社
    四川省成都市郊金牛公社广大社员，决心以各项生产齐头跃进的实际行动，拥护党的八届八中全会公报和决议。
    当社员们26日晚听了党的八届八中全会公报和决议的广播后，都感到党表达了亿万农民的心意。子云管理区七个生产小队的社员进行讨论时，他们把总路线、大跃进、人民公社当作前进的动力、幸福的源泉。社员赖银光说：今年全社小麦增产两成多，油菜籽增产七成多；秋收作物虽然有一部分遭了灾，但是丰收仍然有望，如果没有总路线、大跃进和人民公社，是不可能达到的。七一蔬菜管理区的社员，用具体事实说明了公社的无比优越性。这个管理区有七千多亩蔬菜遭到水淹，但是公社从八个以粮食为主的管理区抽了一千人帮助扮草，一天就扮了六、七百亩，并重新撒上了菜种，使年底又有新菜上市。
    社员们对决议中所说的“第三季度是一个关键。一寸光阴一寸金”体会特别深刻。当晚，很多人就自动下地犁地、增种晚秋作物和蔬菜，抓紧时机突击了一阵。公社党委会连夜重新讨论了公社的生产计划，重新修订了今年的各项生产指标。全社计划在水稻面积缩减一万亩改种蔬菜的情况下，仍然要求保持去年的粮食总产量。办法是：加强田间管理，提高单位面积产量，力争晚稻赶中稻；在三万多亩中稻抢收后，增种一季晚秋作物，保证在四个月内生产蔬菜八千万斤供应城市。对蔬菜生产要增加花色品种，满足城市多方面的需要。
    这个修订后的计划，得到了社员们的热烈赞同。全社十九个管理区，都相互挑战应战，为完成这个计划展开了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛。	增加措施，要晚稻再增产一千万斤
    南昌蒋巷公社
    江西南昌县蒋巷公社社员纷纷集会，表示坚决响应党中央的号召，并且立即掀起了新的生产高潮。
    当晚，各生产小组、生产队和广大社员，向管理区党支部、公社党委递交了八千二百多份决心书。公社党委也召开了公社党委委员紧急会议，分析了当前生产的有利条件之后，修订了晚稻增产指标，决定把晚稻总产量由原计划六千三百八十二万斤提高到七千八百万斤，并且从水、肥、耘田三个方面加订了六条增产措施。
    通过座谈、讨论，社员们的生产热情更加高涨。联圩管理区一千多名社员听了广播的当天晚上扛着四百多部水车上田抗旱，把一百多亩受旱田抢救了出来。滁北大队原来有四十多亩田因为严重干旱不能种晚稻，社员们听广播后立即在田里播种了荞麦和芝麻。27日、28日，全社每天出勤率达到100％。	修订计划，再增产四十万斤粮食
    长葛坡胡公社
    26日晚，河南省长葛县坡胡人民公社社员听到中共八届八中全会发表公报和决议，都欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。
    社员们根据决议的精神，讨论了公社的继续跃进计划。根据查算，全公社主要作物红薯还能生长四十天，晚玉米等杂粮作物还能生长二、三十天，如注意加肥加水加管理，增加产量大有可为。各大队计划：红薯一般再上两次肥，及时翻秧培土；晚玉米再上一次肥，锄一至二遍，并进行授粉、治虫、打杈。要求玉米每亩再增产五十斤，烟叶每亩再增加五十斤，红薯每亩再增加四百斤。这样全公社共将再增产四百四十万斤粮食。	争取今年实现农业发展纲要粮棉指标
    渭南城关公社
    陕西渭南县城关人民公社社员在中共中央八届八中全会的公报和决议的鼓舞下，26日晚举行了万人誓师大会，讨论和修订了今年粮、棉增产计划，一致决定从现在起立即掀起一个秋田超包产运动，争取粮、棉等作物在今年内达到全国农业发展纲要所规定的产量指标。当晚从外地传授经验回来的全国著名植棉能手张秋香，也领导她的作务小组讨论了修订指标、追加措施等问题，提出要对小组经营的棉田多浇一次水、多施一次肥和细务、细收，使每株增加三个桃，每亩增产皮棉七十斤，以这个成就向国庆献礼。
    渭南县城关人民公社从成立以来，各项生产都获得了很大发展。今年上半年，全社的工业总值比去年同期提高了18.3％，农业总值提高了11％。大家畜和猪、羊、家禽的饲养数量也有了增加。
    现在，这个公社的社员，在党的八中全会的公报和决议鼓舞下，个个精神振奋，人人意气风发，决心在原订的增产计划的基础上，争取每亩秋田再多收四十斤粮，每亩棉田再多收十斤花，这样，就可提前达到全国农业发展纲要所规定的产量指标。社员们说干就干，立即投入了抢施肥、抢浇水、抢时间的田间管理竞赛。双王管理区的社员在召开誓师大会的当晚，就开动了十三部动力抽水机和五百零三辆水车，给六百多亩秋田浇了水。程家管理区东王生产队在收听广播后，当晚把十万斤粪肥送到了地里。这个管理区的新庄、赤水两个生产队，原计划在种麦后才联合整修的一条渠道，也当即动手整修，经过两个队的联合突击，在不到十个小时中就整修完毕，现在已经开始放水浇地。（附图片）
