    Determined to Complete Production Tasks One Quarter Ahead of Schedule
    Zhang Jinxi, 107 Construction Site, Wuhan First Construction Engineering Company
    On August 26th, more than a thousand employees of the 107 Construction Site of Wuhan First Construction Engineering Company overfulfilled the state plan for August five days ahead of schedule. Just as we were celebrating the victorious completion of this month's task, the broadcast of the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party came, and we were even more motivated, determined to bravely advance to complete the main indicators of the second five-year plan within this year.
    This year, our construction site is undertaking the construction tasks of Wuhan Cement Plant and Shipyard, two national key projects. From January to now, we have completed the state plan evenly and overfulfilled it every month, and the quality is basically in line with the design requirements. Therefore, our construction site won the honorary title of advanced unit awarded by Hubei Province and Wuhan City in the first and second quarters. Since the third quarter, especially during the great battle in August and September, a production upsurge has already been set off here. All workers on the construction site have generally exceeded their quotas, and the mason Li Deshuang exceeded his quota by as much as 115%. After we listened to the broadcast of the communiqué and resolutions, we were even more motivated, and we held a meeting of construction team leaders and relevant worker group leaders overnight to further increase the third quarter plan indicators originally set by the company. All employees are determined to fight hard in September, complete all of this year's tasks one quarter ahead of schedule, and respond to the Party's call with practical actions to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    决心提前一个季度完成生产任务
    武汉市第一建筑工程公司一零七工地  张金喜
    8月26日，我们武汉市第一建筑工程公司一零七工地一千多名职工，提前五天超额完成了8月份的国家计划。正当我们庆祝这个月胜利完成任务的时候，传来了中共八届八中全会公报的广播，我们更加干劲冲天，坚决为提前在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋勇前进。
    今年我们工地承担着武汉水泥厂和船舶修造厂这两项国家重点工程的建设任务。从1月份到现在，月月都均衡、超额完成了国家计划，质量也基本上合乎设计要求。因此我们工地在一、二季度都获得了湖北省和武汉市奖给先进单位的光荣称号。第三季度以来，特别在大战八、九月中，我们这里已经掀起了生产高潮。全工地工人都普遍突破定额，泥工李德双超过定额高达115％。我们听完了公报和决议的广播后，干劲更大，连夜召开了施工队长和有关职工组长会议，把公司原订的第三季度计划指标进一步提高。全体职工抱定决心，大战9月份，提前一个季度完成今年的全部任务，以实际行动来响应党的号召，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
