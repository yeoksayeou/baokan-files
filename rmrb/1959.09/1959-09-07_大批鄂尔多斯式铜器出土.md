A large number of Ordos-style bronze artifacts have recently been unearthed during a river diversion project on the east bank of the Mutunaya River, five kilometers south of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine near Manzhouli in northeastern Inner Mongolia. The project uncovered an ancient tomb complex. Due to the extensive earthmoving and rapid pace of the project, more than 300 tombs were damaged. However, thanks to the attention of the mine leadership, measures were taken in time to protect more than 120 excavated precious cultural relics.

The Mutunaya River is one of the rivers that drains Lake Dalai, and its banks are vast grasslands. The tomb complex was discovered on a slope formed by river alluvium. The burial objects included handmade pottery pots and jars, mostly made of coarse sandy soil and fired to a reddish-black color at a low temperature. These pottery pieces came in many shapes and were mostly placed on or beside the skulls of the deceased. The most distinctive of the unearthed artifacts is a fragment of a bronze jar with two handles. In addition, many Ordos-style bronze plaques, cast with various figures such as flying horses and deer, were placed on the chests and waists of the deceased, with traces of decayed leather belts still remaining. In each tomb, cylindrical wooden boxes made of birch bark and a large number of bone arrowheads were found. In individual tombs, silk woven with the words "吉祥如意" (auspicious and as desired) and fragments of Han Dynasty kui patterns mirrors were also discovered.

This ancient tomb complex is another significant discovery following the excavation of a large number of Ordos-style bronze artifacts from a tomb complex in Xichagou, Xifeng County, Liaoning Province. Of particular note is that the discovery site, Zhalainuoer, is located near Manzhouli, not far from the national border. Therefore, these tombs are not only important materials for studying the burial customs and artifact systems of fraternal ethnic groups at the time but also provide important clues for studying the cultural connections between China and the West in the early Iron Age.

    大批鄂尔多斯式铜器出土
    内蒙古东北部满洲里附近的札赉诺尔煤矿在矿井南五公里的木图那雅河东岸改河工程中，最近发现了一座古墓群，出土有大批鄂尔多斯式铜器。因取土工程浩大，速度很快，致使三百多座墓葬受到了破坏。但是由于矿务局领导上的重视，在发现这个情况以后，及时采取措施，使一百二十多件出土的珍贵文物得到了保护。
    木图那雅河是达来湖退水的河流之一，两岸都是广阔的草原，墓群就发现在河水冲积的坡地上。随葬品中有手制陶壶、陶罐，多用粗砂土烧制成红黑色，火候很低。这些陶器形制很多，大都是放在死者的头骨上端或两侧。出土文物中最有特色的是一件双耳残铜罐。此外，在死者胸前和腰间放着很多铸有飞马鹿等各种姿态的鄂尔多斯式铜牌子，上面还残留着皮带腐朽的痕迹。在每个墓里，都发现有桦树皮制作的圆筒形木盒和大量骨制镞头。在个别的墓里还发现有织着“吉祥如意”字样的丝绸和残碎汉代规矩镜。
    这个古墓群，是继辽宁西丰县西岔沟发现出土大量鄂尔多斯式铜器的墓群以后的又一次重要发现。特别值得注意的是，发现地点札赉诺尔在满洲里附近距国境线不远。所以这批墓葬不仅是研究当时兄弟民族埋葬习俗及其文物制度的重要资料，而且对于研究铁器时代早期中国和西方的文化联系也提供了重要线索。
