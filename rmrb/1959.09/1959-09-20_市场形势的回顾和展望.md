    In his letter to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 14, Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, stated: "The political and economic situation of the country is extremely good." This statement accurately summarizes the situation on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation. In the economic field, while industrial and agricultural production continues to leap forward, the market situation is also good.

    Looking at the total retail sales of social commodities, the first half of this year increased by 23% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the retail sales of forty-one major consumer goods, which have historically accounted for 72% to 75% of total consumer goods retail sales, increased by 13% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. These forty-one major consumer goods include twelve types of food, eight types of clothing, nineteen types of daily use items, and two types of fuel. Among the twelve types of food, the retail volume of grain, which is most important to people's livelihood, increased by 17.9% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, and by 30.9% compared to the second half of last year. The retail volume of other food items such as edible vegetable oil, edible salt, wine, and tea also increased compared to the same period last year. Take cigarettes, which have appeared somewhat tight in the market, for example. The supply has not decreased, but increased. The retail volume of cigarettes in the first half of this year reached more than 2.8 million cases, an increase of 36.9% compared to the same period last year, 10.2% compared to the second half of last year, and 1.1 million cases more than the total retail volume of cigarettes in 1950. Among the eight types of clothing, except for cotton wadding, which is an agricultural product, the other seven types are industrial products. The retail volume of these seven industrial products in the first half of this year increased by 42% compared to the same period last year, among which the retail volume of cotton cloth, which is most important to people's livelihood, increased by 35.4%. The retail volume of knitted goods such as undershirts, vests, socks, towels, health shirts and pants, and cotton interlock shirts and pants increased by 60.4%. The retail volume of some high-end clothing items also increased significantly. For example, the retail volume of silk and satin in the first half of this year increased by 25% compared to the same period last year, and the retail volume of woolen fabrics increased by 74.8%. Among the nineteen types of daily use items, except for light bulbs, watches, and machine-made paper, which slightly decreased, the retail volume in the first half of this year also increased compared to the same period last year. Among them, the retail volume of radios increased by 89.4%, the retail volume of clocks increased by 53.7%, and the retail volume of enamel mugs, gold pens, fountain pens, and pencils all increased by more than double. Take soap and bicycles, which have appeared somewhat tight in the market, for example. The supply has not decreased, but increased. The retail volume of soap in the first half of this year increased by 37.8% compared to the same period last year, and the retail volume of bicycles increased by 30.5% compared to the same period last year. The good market situation is not only reflected in the increase in commodity retail sales, but also in the stability of prices and the increase in commodity inventories. Taking the prices of forty-one major consumer goods in thirty large and medium-sized cities in December 1957 as 100, it was 99.1 in December 1958 and also 99.1 in June 1959. It can be seen that the prices in June this year remained stable at the level of December last year; compared with December of the year before last, it also decreased by 0.9%. In terms of commodity inventory, despite the significant increase in commodity retail sales in the first half of this year, by the end of June, the total commodity inventory of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises still increased by 15.9% compared to the same period last year.

    The increase or decrease of social commodity retail sales, the rise or fall of prices, and the increase or decrease of commodity inventory are the main indicators of the market situation. The increase in social commodity retail sales, the stability of prices, and the increase in commodity inventory in the first half of this year fully demonstrate that our market situation is not what some people say as "overall tension" or "terrible," but is very good.

    Since "overall market tension" is nonsense, the fallacy that "the Great Leap Forward has messed things up, causing overall market tension" is also self-defeating. On the contrary, the good market situation this year should be attributed to the Great Leap Forward. As mentioned earlier, social commodity retail sales in the first half of this year increased by 23% compared to the same period last year, and commodity inventory at the end of June increased by 15.9% compared to the same period last year. The growth in these two aspects totals more than 9.5 billion yuan. In other words, compared to the same period last year, commercial departments alone sold and stored more than 9.5 billion yuan worth of goods in the first half of this year. These goods were neither bestowed by God nor "conjured up" by magicians, but were created by the 600 million people in the Great Leap Forward of industrial and agricultural production. This proves that the Great Leap Forward is very good, and the Great Leap Forward has greatly increased social products, which has led to a corresponding increase in social commodity retail sales and commodity inventory. To insist that "the Great Leap Forward has messed things up, causing overall market tension" is simply nonsense, isn't it? As for the so-called "People's Communes have messed things up, causing overall market tension," it is also malicious slander. On the contrary, the good market situation this year should also be attributed to the People's Communes. Because the People's Communes have greater advantages than advanced agricultural production cooperatives, they have promoted the tremendous development of agricultural production and diversified rural operations. After the rural communization, the amount of major agricultural products provided by farmers to cities has not decreased, but has greatly increased. From July 1958 to June 1959, the total amount of grain purchased by the state increased by 20% compared to the previous year. From September 1958 to August 1959, the total amount of cotton purchased by the state increased by 23% compared to the previous year. It can be seen that the People's Communes are very good, and the People's Communes have greatly developed agricultural production and diversified rural operations, which has provided more agricultural products to the cities. To insist that "the People's Communes have messed things up, causing overall market tension" is also nonsense, isn't it?

    Of course, when we say that the market situation is very good, it does not mean that no problems have ever occurred, or that there are no problems now. Since the beginning of this year, the supply of a small portion of commodities in the market has indeed been somewhat insufficient. The Party and the government have taken a series of measures in a timely manner to address this issue, especially after the Central Committee of the Party convened a conference on non-staple food and handicraft production in large and medium-sized cities in Shanghai in June, the situation has changed significantly. It can be seen that the temporary shortage of a small portion of commodities, compared with the tremendous increase in the total supply of commodities, is at most only one finger out of ten. Why has the supply of a small portion of commodities in the market been somewhat insufficient since the beginning of this year? Separately, the supply of non-staple foods such as pork in cities has decreased compared to the past because the consumption of farmers as a whole has increased considerably; the insufficient supply of some daily-use industrial products and small commodities in certain regions and at certain times is due to some shortcomings in the production arrangement. However, overall, the somewhat tight supply of a small portion of commodities in the market is mainly because the growth in commodity retail sales, although greatly increased, still cannot keep up with the needs of the people's growing purchasing power. The tremendous growth in people's purchasing power is due, on the one hand, to the Great Leap Forward in industry, with a somewhat excessive and rapid increase in the number of employees last year; on the other hand, it is due to the communization of rural areas and the bumper harvest in agricultural production, which has also greatly increased the purchasing power of farmers. This is the fundamental reason why, despite the tremendous increase in social commodity retail sales, the supply of a small portion of commodities in the market has still been somewhat insufficient.

    Western reactionaries spread rumors that "the Chinese market is tight because of too much export." This is pure nonsense. Yes, our country exports some agricultural products and industrial products every year to exchange for machinery, equipment, and raw materials that our country cannot produce or does not produce enough of (such as rubber, oil, special steel, etc.). This is a good thing, it is necessary for large-scale economic construction, and it is beneficial to the country and the people. In the future, as long as possible, we will appropriately expand this foreign trade. However, the quantity of our exports is negligible compared to the quantity of our production. To say that too much export has affected the supply of the domestic market has no basis whatsoever. Taking the export quantity of grain and pork this year as an example, as of August 15, the total amount of exported rice and exported pork accounted for less than 1% of last year's rice production and the total number of live pigs at the end of last year. If this quantity is distributed among everyone, in eight and a half months, each person would only cook a little more than half a bowl of rice per month, and the pork would only be about the size of a small date. It can be seen that the so-called "Chinese market is tight because of too much export" is completely a malicious slander.

    The tight supply of a small portion of commodities, which has emerged in the context of a tremendous increase in commodity retail sales but still cannot keep up with the growth of people's purchasing power, is a temporary and local phenomenon in the leaping advancement of our socialist cause, and it is fundamentally different from the tense situation of the people's lives before liberation. Before liberation, the vast majority of workers and peasants did not have enough food to eat or clothes to wear, and they did not know where the next meal would come from. This tension was a tension of struggling on the brink of death. Now, the basic living needs of the vast majority of the people have been guaranteed. Not only that, but everyone also has surplus money to eat better and buy more things. Under these circumstances, the failure of the supply of a small portion of commodities to fully meet the needs does not mean that people's lives have been lowered, but that people's lives have been improved. This is something that everyone who has suffered from the hardships of life before liberation has personally experienced. Therefore, for the broad masses of working people, the temporary shortage of individual commodities is completely understandable, and they completely trust that the Party and the government can quickly solve this problem. In fact, some daily-use small commodities that were once out of stock have quickly been supplied in large quantities in the market again.

    Of course, compared with some industrialized countries, the living standards of our people are still very low. We must continue to make great efforts to fundamentally get rid of the situation of "poverty and blankness." Some people feel strange that the output of many of our products is very large, but the amount that each person gets has not increased much. This is because they have forgotten how many people there are in our country, and they have forgotten to use division. For example, an increase of 10 billion catties in grain production is a very large number; but when divided by 650 million people, each person only gets a little more than one catty of grain per month on average. For another example, an increase of 10 million pigs is also a very large number; but when divided, assuming each pig yields 100 catties of meat, each person only gets a little more than one tael of meat per month on average. Conversely, although the amount of consumption increased by each person is extremely limited, the total consumption of the country is very large when multiplied by 650 million. For example, if each person eats two taels more rice per day, which is just half a bowl more rice, it seems negligible; but when multiplied, the whole country eats 47.4 billion catties more grain per year, which is about 22% of China's total grain output in the early days of liberation. For another example, if each person uses one foot more cloth per year, which is not enough to sew a pair of underpants, it also seems negligible; but when multiplied, the whole country will increase the consumption of 650 million feet of cloth per year, which requires six or seven modern large-scale textile mills with 100,000 spindles and 1,000 looms to produce for one year to supply.

    So, is a large population a burden? Of course not. A large population and large consumption is a fact; however, a large population and great strength is also a fact, and it is a more important fact. The multiplication and division mentioned above should first be used to calculate increased production and savings, and then to calculate consumption. For example, if the total agricultural output value increases by 5 billion yuan each year, this is a very large number; but when divided, each farmer only increases production by 10 yuan per year for the country, which is not difficult to do. For another example, if each person saves one dime per month, this is negligible; but when multiplied, the whole country can save 780 million yuan in purchasing power per year, which is such a large number. Moreover, the fact that a large population means great strength cannot be estimated by such a mathematical method. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago: "A large population means more discussion, high enthusiasm, and great drive." "It may not take as long as previously thought for our country to catch up with the capitalist powers in terms of industrial and agricultural production. In addition to the leadership of the Party, a population of 600 million is a decisive factor." Last year's Great Leap Forward proved how great a power can be generated by mobilizing the strength of 650 million people to develop the national economy at high speed!

    As long as we are good at relying on the strength of 650 million people, there will be no insurmountable difficulties on our road forward. The situation is the same in industry and agriculture, and of course, it is also the same in commerce. The situation of insufficient supply of a small portion of commodities in the market has been greatly improved through a series of effective measures taken by the central and local authorities. Because major cities have implemented the principle of "self-reliance as the main factor and striving for external assistance as a supplementary factor" for non-staple foods, in July, the amount of vegetables on the market in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian reached more than 500 million catties, an increase of nearly 40% compared to June. In August, the market situation improved even more, and the supply of meat and sugar increased significantly. This month, the sales volume of fattened pigs nationwide increased by 30.8% compared to July, the sales volume of beef cattle increased by 24%, the sales volume of mutton sheep increased by 38.7%, the sales volume of aquatic products increased by 11.4%, and the sales volume of sugar increased by 41.3%. In terms of daily-use industrial products and small commodities, the production and purchase volume have also increased significantly. In August, the total purchase volume of daily-use small commodities in the eight major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, and Chongqing increased by 31.6% compared to July, among which the purchase volume of sixty-six major small commodities increased by 58.8%. Due to the increase in production and purchase volume, the situation of somewhat insufficient supply of certain daily-use industrial products and small commodities has changed significantly. While increasing production, various agencies, troops, enterprises, and institutions have done everything possible to reduce office expenses and the purchase of various office supplies, and the broad masses of the people have also actively responded to the government's call to save money that is temporarily not needed in banks. The practice of building the country through diligence and thrift, running people's communes through diligence and thrift, running all enterprises and undertakings through diligence and thrift, and managing households through diligence and thrift has been further promoted, and will be greatly promoted in the future. At present, although there are still very few commodities that are in short supply for a period of time, such as pork (because pigs grow relatively slowly, sows are pregnant for five months before giving birth to piglets, and piglets need to be raised for eight or nine months before they grow up), but in general, the situation of somewhat insufficient supply of a small portion of commodities in the market has greatly improved, and there will inevitably be greater improvements in the future.

    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, the diligent and brave Chinese people are united and continue to leap forward. The main indicators of our country's great Second Five-Year Plan will be realized ahead of schedule this year. Our reality is beautiful, and our future is even more beautiful. Let us continue to exert all our efforts, strive for the upstream, vigorously increase production and practice thrift, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan, so as to create more favorable conditions for the more beautiful future of our great motherland and each of us!

    市场形势的回顾和展望
    中共中央主席毛泽东同志在9月14日写给全国人民代表大会常务委员会的信中说：“国家的政治经济情况极为良好。”这句话准确地概括了我国建国十周年前夕的形势。在经济领域中，在工农业生产继续跃进的同时，市场的形势也是良好的。
    拿社会商品零售额来看，今年上半年比去年同期增长了23％。其中历来都占消费品零售总额72％到75％的四十一种主要消费商品的零售额，今年上半年比去年同期增长了13％。这四十一种主要消费商品中，有十二种吃的商品，八种穿的商品，十九种用的商品和两种烧的商品。十二种吃的商品中，关系民生最大的粮食的零售量，今年上半年比去年同期增长了17.9％，比去年下半年增长了30.9％。其他食用植物油、食盐、酒、茶叶等吃的商品的零售量也是比去年同期增长的。就拿市场上曾经显得有些紧张的卷烟来说，供应量也不是减少了，而是增加了。今年上半年卷烟的零售量达二百八十多万箱，比去年同期增长了36.9％，比去年下半年增长了10.2％，比1950年全年的卷烟零售量还增加了一百一十万箱。八种穿的商品中，除絮棉是农产品外，其他七种都是工业品。这七种工业品今年上半年的零售量比去年同期增长了42％，其中关系民生最大的棉布的零售量增长了35.4％。汗衫、背心、袜子、毛巾、卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤等针织品的零售量增长了60.4％，一些穿的高级商品的零售量也有了很大的增长。例如，今年上半年绸缎的零售量就比去年同期增长了25％，呢绒的零售量增长了74.8％。十九种用的商品中，除了电灯泡、手表、机制纸三种略有减少以外，今年上半年的零售量也是比去年同期增长的。其中收音机的零售量增长了89.4％，钟的零售量增长了53.7％，搪瓷口杯、金笔、钢笔、铅笔的零售量都增长了一倍以上。就拿市场上曾经显得有些紧张的肥皂和自行车来说，供应量也不是减少了，而是增加了。今年上半年肥皂的零售量比去年同期增长了37.8％，自行车的零售量比去年同期增长了30.5％。市场情况良好不仅表现在商品零售额的增长上面，而且还表现在物价的平稳和商品库存的增加上面。以1957年12月三十个大中城市四十一种主要消费商品的价格为100，1958年12月是99.1，1959年6月也是99.1。可见，今年6月的物价仍然稳定在去年12月的水平上；如果同前年12月比较，还下降了0.9％。在商品库存方面，尽管今年上半年商品零售额有了很大的增长，但是到6月末，国营及合作社营商业商品库存总量仍然比去年同期增长了15.9％。
    社会商品零售额的消长、物价的升降、商品库存的增减，是市场情势好坏的主要标志。我国今年上半年社会商品零售额增长了，物价是平稳的，商品库存增加了，这三方面的情况充分说明我们的市场情况，不是像有些人所说的什么“全面紧张”，什么“糟得很”，而是好得很。
    既然“市场全面紧张”是无稽之谈，所谓“大跃进搞糟了，造成市场全面紧张”的谬论也就不攻自破了。相反地，今年市场形势的良好，倒是应该归功于大跃进。前面说过，今年上半年社会商品零售额比去年同期增长23％，6月末的商品库存比去年同期增长15.9％。这两方面的增长，共达九十五亿多元人民币。换句话说，同去年同期比较，今年上半年仅是商业部门就多销了和多存了价值九十五亿多元的商品。这些商品既不是上帝赐与的，也不是魔术家“变”出来的，而是六亿多人民在工农业生产大跃进中创造出来的。这证明大跃进好得很，大跃进使社会产品有了极大的增长，才使社会商品零售额和商品库存有了相应的增长。硬说“大跃进搞糟了，造成了市场全面紧张”，这不是胡说八道么？至于所谓“人民公社搞糟了，造成了市场全面紧张”，也是恶意的诽谤。相反，今年市场形势的良好，也应该归功于人民公社。由于人民公社比高级农业生产合作社具有更大的优越性，促进了农业生产和农村多种经营的巨大发展。农村公社化之后，农民提供给城市的主要农产品的数量不是减少了，而是大大地增加了。自1958年7月至1959年6月整个粮食年度，国家征购的粮食总量比上一年度增加了20％。自1958年9月至1959年8月整个棉花生产年度，国家征购的棉花总量比上一年度增加了23％。可见，人民公社好得很，人民公社使农业生产和农村多种经营得到极大的发展，这才为城市提供了更多的农产品。硬说“人民公社搞糟了，造成了市场全面紧张”，这不也是胡说八道吗？
    当然，我们说市场情况好得很，并不是说一点问题也不曾发生过，或者现在什么问题也没有了。今年以来，市场上确实有一小部分商品的供应曾经有些不足。党和政府为此已经及时地采取了一系列的措施，特别是党中央6月间在上海召开大中城市副食品、手工业生产会议以后，情况已经有了显著的改变。可见一小部分商品的暂时紧张，比起总的商品供应量的巨大增长的情况来，充其量只是十个指头中的一个指头。为什么今年以来市场上一小部分商品的供应有些不足呢？分别看来，城市里猪肉等副食品的供应比过去减少，是因为农民的消费量整个说来是有了相当大的增加；一些日用工业品和小商品在某些地区和某一时间内供应不足，是因为生产的安排上有一些缺点。但是，总起来说，市场上一小部分商品的供应有些紧张，主要是因为商品零售额虽然有了极大的增长，仍然赶不上人民购买力增长的需要。人民购买力的巨大增长，一方面是由于工业的大跃进，职工人数去年增加得有些过多过快；另一方面是由于农村的人民公社化，由于农业生产的大丰收，农民的购买力也有了很大的增长。这就是为什么尽管社会商品零售额有了极大的增长，市场上仍然有一小部分商品的供应曾经有些不足的根本原因。
    西方的反动派造谣说：“中国市场紧张，是因为出口出多了。”这纯粹是一派胡言。是的，我国每年都要出口一些农产品和工业品，换回我国不能生产或者生产不足的机器设备和原料（如橡胶、石油、特殊钢材等）。这是一件好事，是进行大规模的经济建设所必需的，是有利于国家和人民的。今后，只要有可能，我们还要适当地扩大这种对外贸易。但是，我们的出口数量同我们的生产数量比较起来，是微乎其微的。说是出口出多了，影响了国内市场的供应，是一点根据也没有的。拿今年粮食和猪肉的出口数量来说，到8月15日为止，出口大米和出口猪肉的总额都不足去年大米产量和去年年底生猪总数的1％。这个数量分到每个人头上，八个半月中，每人每月不过煮半碗多饭，猪肉只有小枣那么大的一块。可见，所谓“中国市场紧张，是因为出口出多了”，完全是一种恶毒的污蔑。
    在商品零售额有了极大的增长，但是仍然赶不上人民购买力的增长的情况下，所出现的一小部分商品供应紧张的情况，是我国社会主义事业在飞跃前进中的暂时的局部的现象，同解放前我国人民生活的紧张情况是根本不同的。解放前，广大工农食不果腹，衣不蔽体，有了上一顿没有下一顿。这种紧张是挣扎在死亡线上的紧张。现在，广大人民群众的基本生活需要已经有了保障。不但如此，大家还有了余钱，可以吃得更好一些，可以买更多的东西。在这种情况下，一小部分商品的供应不能完全满足需要，不是说明人民生活降低了，而是说明人民生活提高了。这是每一个在解放前受过生活煎熬的人切身体会到的。因此对于广大的劳动人民来说，个别商品的暂时供应不足是完全可以理解的，他们完全信赖党和政府能够迅速地解决这个问题。事实上，一些曾经缺货的日用小商品，很快地就又在市场上大量供应了。
    当然，同一些工业发达的国家比较起来，我国人民的生活水平至今还是很低的。我们要根本摆脱“一穷二白”的状况，还要继续进行巨大努力。有人对于我国许多产品的产量很大，而每个人所得的却增加不多，感觉奇怪。这是他们忘记了我国有多少人口，忘记了用除法。譬如，粮食的产量增加一百亿斤，这是一个很大的数字；但是用六亿五千万一除，平均每人每月只不过分到一斤多粮食。又譬如，生猪的数量增加一千万头，这也是一个很大的数字；但是一用除法，以每头出肉一百斤计算，平均每人每月只不过分到一两多肉。反过来说，尽管每个人增加的消费数量极其有限，用六亿五千万一乘，全国的消费总量却很大。譬如，每人每天多吃二两米，不过是多吃半碗饭，看来是微乎其微的；但是一用乘法，全国每年就多吃掉四百七十四亿斤粮食，约等于我国解放初期粮食总产量的22％。又譬如，每人每年多用一尺布，不够缝一件裤叉，看起来也是微乎其微的；但是一用乘法，全国一年就要增加六亿五千万尺布的消费，需要六、七个具有十万枚纱锭、一千台布机的现代化大型纺织厂生产一年才能够供应。
    那么，人多是不是就成为一种负担呢？当然不是如此。人多，消费大，这是事实；但是，人多，力量大，这也是事实，并且是更重要的事实。上面所说的乘法和除法，首先应当用来计算增产和节约，其次才应当用来计算消费。譬如，农业总产值每年增加五十亿元，这是一个很大的数字；但是一用除法，分到每个农民手上，也不过每人每年为国家增产十元财富，是并不难做到的。又譬如，每人每月节省一角钱，这是微不足道的；但是一用乘法，全国一年就可以节约七亿八千万元购买力，这又是一个多么大的数字。而且，人多、力量大，还远远不是这样一个数学方法所能估量的。毛泽东同志早就说过：“人多议论多，热气高，干劲大”“我国在工农业生产方面赶上资本主义大国，可能不需要从前所想的那样长的时间了。除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”去年的大跃进就证明，把六亿五千万人民的力量动员起来，对高速度发展国民经济，可以产生多么巨大的威力！
    只要我们善于依靠六亿五千万人民的力量，我们在前进的道路上就没有不可克服的困难。在工业、农业方面的情况是如此，在商业方面的情况当然也是如此。市场上一小部分商品的供应不足的情况，经过中央和地方采取一系列的有力措施，已经有了很大改进。由于各大城市对于副食品执行了“自力更生为主、力争外援为辅”的方针，7月份，北京、上海、天津、旅大四个大城市的蔬菜上市量达五亿多斤，比6月份增加了将近40％。8月份，市场情况有了更大改进，肉类和食糖的供应量都有了不少增加。这个月，全国肥猪销售量比7月份增加了30.8％，菜牛销售量增加了24％，菜羊销售量增加了38.7％，水产品销售量增加了11.4％，食糖销售量增加了41.3％。在日用工业品和小商品方面，生产量和收购量也有了很大的增长。8月份，北京、天津、上海、沈阳、广州、武汉、西安、重庆八大城市日用小商品的收购总量比7月份增长了31.6％，其中六十六种主要小商品的收购额增长了58.8％。由于生产量和收购量增加，某些日用工业品和小商品供应有些不足的情况已经有了显著的改变。在增加生产的同时，各地机关、部队、企业、事业单位都尽一切可能减少了办公杂支和购买各种办公用具的开支，广大人民也踊跃响应政府的号召，把暂时不用的钱储蓄到银行里。勤俭建国、勤俭办人民公社、勤俭办一切企业和事业、勤俭持家的风气有了进一步的发扬，今后还将大大地发扬。目前，虽然还有极少数商品在一段时间内供应不足，例如猪肉（因为猪的生长比较慢，母猪怀胎五个月才生小猪，小猪要养八九个月才能长大），但是总的说来，市场上一小部分商品供应有些不足的情况已经大有改进，今后必然会有更大的改进。
    勤劳勇敢的中国人民，正在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，团结一致，继续跃进。我国伟大的第二个五年计划的主要指标将在今年内提前实现。我们的现实是美好的，我们的前景更是美好的。让我们继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，厉行增产节约，争取完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，为我们伟大祖国和我们每一个人的更加美好的未来，创造更加有利的条件吧！
