Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The second round of the volleyball finals of the First National Games is becoming increasingly intense, and the situation is becoming more complicated. The Jiangxi team and the Liaoning team, which defeated the People's Liberation Army men's team and the Guangdong men's team in the first round, both lost to the Shanghai team and the Jilin team today. Their scores were: Shanghai defeated Jiangxi three to one, and Jilin defeated Liaoning three to two. Adding to the complexity of the situation is the decisive battle between Jiangsu and Hubei. The Hubei team was the fifth-place finisher in last year's National Volleyball League (Division A) and won the championship in the Changchun competition zone in the preliminary round; the Jiangsu men's volleyball team is a Division B team, with three athletes who have not yet obtained the qualifications of graded athletes. However, today Hubei surprisingly lost to Jiangsu with a score of one to three.
The competition among the women's teams is also exceptionally fierce, and the situation has begun to change. The Guizhou team, which ranked eighth in last year's National Volleyball League (Division A), lost to the Guangdong team, which ranked sixth in last year's National Volleyball League (Division B), after a back-and-forth battle with a score of two to three.
