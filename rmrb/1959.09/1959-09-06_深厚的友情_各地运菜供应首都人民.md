Xinhua News Agency report: In recent days, vegetables from many provinces and cities supporting Beijing have been continuously arriving, and are now being put on the market in large quantities to supply residents.

At the beginning of August, Beijing experienced heavy rainstorms, and vegetable crops suffered serious damage. The people of all regions were very concerned about the disaster in the suburbs of the capital, and supported the people of Beijing with a large number of vegetables. In recent days, the vegetables from all provinces and cities supporting Beijing have reached more than 20 million jin. Heilongjiang Province transported more than 10 million jin; Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shanghai and other provinces and cities transported 2 million jin. The vegetables transported from all regions include cabbage, winter melon, eggplant, bell pepper, tomato, etc., and the quality is relatively good.

In order to put the vegetables supported by all regions on the market in time, the transportation and commercial departments of Beijing have closely cooperated. The city and districts have established transportation coordination headquarters to organize various vehicles to launch a surprise assault, so that the vegetables are unloaded and distributed as soon as they arrive. Railway workers, loading and unloading workers, and workers on trucks, horse-drawn carts, and tricycles are working with great enthusiasm, and they are loading and transporting day and night even in rainy weather. They proposed: "No matter how heavy the rain or how late it is, we must transport all the vegetables transferred from brother provinces and cities, and not let a single vegetable rot at the station."

The people of the capital believe that they can still eat a large number of fresh vegetables after the severe disaster in the suburbs. This is the result of the Party and the government's concern for the people's lives. They expressed their deep gratitude to the care of the Party and the government and the support of the people of all regions.

    深厚的友情
    各地运菜供应首都人民
    据新华社讯　许多省市支援北京的蔬菜近几天来源源运到，现在正大量上市供应居民。
    8月初，北京地区连降暴雨，蔬菜严重遭灾。各地人民对首都郊区的灾情非常关切，以大量蔬菜支援首都人民，近日来，各省市支援北京的蔬菜已运到两千多万斤。黑龙江省运来了一千多万斤；河北、山西、辽宁、上海等省市运来了两百万斤。各地运到的蔬菜，有洋白菜、冬瓜、茄子、柿子椒、西红柿等等，质量都比较好。
    为了把各地支援的蔬菜及时上市供应，北京市的运输部门和商业部门紧密协作，市和各区都成立了运输协作指挥部，组织各种车辆突击，做到蔬菜随到随卸随分配。铁路职工，装卸搬运工人，汽车、马车、三轮车的工人们，干劲冲天，就是在雨天也日夜不停地装运。他们提出：“不管雨多大，天多晚，一定要把兄弟省市调来的蔬菜运完，不让蔬菜在车站烂一棵”。
    首都人民认为，郊区严重受灾后还能吃到大批的新鲜蔬菜，这是党和政府对人民生活关怀的结果。他们对党和政府的关怀以及各地人民的支援，表示深切的感谢。
