Xinhua News Agency, 25th — The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today issued a statement supporting the Kenyan people's struggle for national independence and demanding the immediate release of Jomo Kenyatta. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee warmly responds to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold "Kenya Day" and "Jomo Kenyatta Day," resolutely supports the just struggle of the Kenyan people against British colonial rule and for national independence, and pays high tribute to the Kenyan people.

    For a long time, the British colonialists have carried out cruel plunder and enslavement of the Kenyan people, and have adopted various terrorist means to brutally suppress the Kenyan national independence movement. In October 1952, the British colonial authorities unreasonably arrested Jomo Kenyatta, a well-known leader of the national movement in Kenya and Africa. After six years of imprisonment, he was exiled to the border area of northern Kenya in April of this year. Recently, the British government has even conspired to turn Kenya into its military base in East and Central Africa in order to further suppress the African national independence movement. All this has aroused the utmost anger and resolute opposition of the Kenyan and African people. The Chinese people condemn British colonial rule in Kenya, condemn the crimes of the British colonialists in persecuting Kenyan patriotic leaders, and demand the immediate and unconditional release of Jomo Kenyatta and other patriotic leaders.

    The Chinese people are pleased to see that the Kenyan people's struggle for national independence is developing day by day. We have always had deep sympathy for the just struggle of the Kenyan people. In the struggle against colonialism and imperialism, and for promoting Asian-African solidarity and world peace, the people of our country will always stand together with the Kenyan people and the African people. We believe that today, when the forces for world peace are unprecedentedly strong, the African national independence movement is surging, the African people are increasingly awakened, and the colonial system is collapsing day by day, as long as the Kenyan people unite, fight resolutely, and are vigilant against all kinds of imperialist conspiracies, they will surely achieve the final victory in the struggle for national independence.

    中国亚非团结委员会发表声明
    支持怯尼亚争取独立斗争
    要求英殖民当局立即释放怯尼亚爱国领袖
    新华社25日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表声明，支持怯尼亚人民争取民族独立的斗争，要求立即释放乔莫·肯雅塔。声明全文如下：
    中国亚非团结委员会热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会关于举行“怯尼亚日”和“乔莫·肯雅塔日”的号召，坚决支持怯尼亚人民反对英国殖民统治、争取民族独立的正义斗争，并向怯尼亚人民致崇高的敬意。
    英国殖民主义者长期以来对怯尼亚人民进行了残酷的掠夺与奴役，并采取各种恐怖手段，残暴地镇压怯尼亚的民族独立运动。1952年10月英国殖民当局无理逮捕了怯尼亚和非洲著名的民族主义运动领袖乔莫·肯雅塔，在六年监禁之后，又于今年4月把他放逐到怯尼亚北部的边境地区。最近英国政府更阴谋把怯尼亚变为它在东非和中非的军事基地，以便进一步镇压非洲的民族独立运动，这一切已经引起怯尼亚人民和非洲人民的无比愤怒和坚决反对。中国人民谴责英国对怯尼亚的殖民统治，谴责英国殖民主义者迫害怯尼亚爱国领袖的罪行，要求立即无条件地释放乔莫·肯雅塔和其他爱国领袖。
    中国人民高兴地看到，怯尼亚人民要求民族独立的斗争正在日益发展。我们对怯尼亚人民的正义斗争一向怀着深切的同情。在反对殖民主义与帝国主义，促进亚非团结与世界和平的斗争中，我国人民将永远和怯尼亚人民与非洲人民站在一起。我们相信，在世界和平力量空前强大，非洲民族独立运动汹涌澎湃和非洲人民日益觉醒，殖民主义体系日趋崩溃的今天，只要怯尼亚人民团结起来，坚决斗争，警惕帝国主义的各种阴谋，就一定能取得民族独立斗争的最后胜利。
