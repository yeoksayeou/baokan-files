Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 11th: Through a large-scale performance competition, Anshan Iron and Steel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces have vigorously promoted mass movements, continuously improving production levels. Steel production in July increased by 9.79% compared to June, and in August, it increased by another 4.9% compared to July. Compared to April, the average daily steel production in August increased by 50%, the utilization coefficient increased by 3.05, and the operating rate increased by 20.92%.

The mass performance competition in Anshan Iron and Steel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces began in May of this year. This performance competition mainly aims to improve technical levels through the workers' own production and operational practices. However, after the competition was widely launched, not only did the workers' technical levels improve, but it also promoted mutual comparisons of work enthusiasm, intelligence, and cooperation among workers, forming a mass movement to comprehensively improve thinking, technology, and production. It promotes, complements, and enriches the current popular opponent competition and collaboration competition.

The forms of performance competition include individual performance competition, cross-performance competition, and collective performance competition. During the performance, new workers perform, and veteran workers teach from the side; veteran workers perform, and new workers learn from the side. After the performance, evaluations and assessments are organized. If someone has advantages, they are summarized, improved, and promoted throughout the factory. If someone has shortcomings, they are helped to improve. This type of performance competition, because it meets the urgent needs of the broad masses to improve technology and production, adopts the form of on-site observation and personal accounts that the masses enjoy. Therefore, not only advanced producers and veteran workers participate in the performance competition, but also new workers and workers with poorer operating skills. This performance competition started in the open-hearth furnace section, and later other sections also actively participated in the performance. Up to now, a total of more than 49,000 employee participations have been recorded in the performance competition, with an average of nearly 20 participations per person.

This performance competition prompts the advanced to become more advanced, and the backward to strive to catch up with the advanced. Yang Derong, the furnace chief of Ding shift in the 21st open-hearth furnace, used to lag behind others in his work. Through the performance competition, he humbly learned from the advanced, worked actively and proactively, and was recently rated as an advanced producer.

In the performance competition, workers rapidly improved their technical skills through their own operational practices. According to statistics from the open-hearth furnace, ingot casting, and furnace repair sections, 297 people have improved their technical level by one grade or are close to improving by one grade, and 48 people have been formally promoted to foreman, furnace chief, first assistant, and second assistant. Feng Zhitai and other open-hearth furnace workers used and enriched the Soviet expert's method of using a chisel instead of oxygen to open the tapping hole in their performances, increasing work efficiency by more than tenfold and solving key production problems. In April, 71 hours were lost due to the tapping hole being unable to be opened, but this phenomenon was greatly reduced in July.

The performance competition also effectively improved enterprise management levels and improved the mutual relationships between shifts and sections. The factory director, foremen, furnace chiefs, and workers are all very satisfied with the performance competition. The factory director is satisfied with continuously overfulfilling the national plan; the foremen are satisfied with the good collaboration between sections and open-hearth furnaces; the furnace chiefs are satisfied with the full enthusiasm of the workers in the entire furnace; and the workers are satisfied with the rapid improvement of their technical levels.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 11th: The experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel's five fixed open-hearth furnace performance competition is being rapidly promoted and developed in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel. Currently, 40 production factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel have promoted this experience.

Many factories and mines, through the performance competition, have mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees and have achieved comprehensive ideological, production, and technical harvests. Luan Degui, the furnace chief of the No. 10 open-hearth furnace in the Second Steelmaking Plant, originally believed that it was impossible to successfully perform the task of increasing the charging amount to 330 tons and tapping the steel in nine hours; however, the performance resulted in the steel being refined in only eight hours and thirty minutes. This fact broke his conservative thinking, and the next day he personally requested a performance, creating a new record of refining a furnace of steel in seven hours and thirty minutes. The pipe-making section of the welded pipe products factory summarized and promoted the "three fasts, one diligent, tightly packed operation method" and the "three fasts, one steady, one accurate operation method" created by the workers in their performances, which universally improved the operating level of the entire section. This section was 160 tons short of production at the beginning of July, but by the end of July, it not only made up for the deficit but also completed the plan four hours ahead of schedule.

This performance competition is actually a new development in the experience of implementing the mass line and vigorously carrying out mass movements in modern large enterprises, and it can absorb more masses to participate in the increase production and practice economy movement. The Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee attach great importance to this experience, have called on various factories and mines to vigorously promote it, and have demanded that it be well summarized and improved to make it more perfect.

    实地观摩  现身说法  鼓舞干劲  提高技术
    鞍钢表演竞赛果实累累
    据新华社鞍山11日电　鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉通过声势浩大的表演竞赛，大搞群众运动，使生产水平不断提高。钢产量7月份比6月份提高9.79％，8月份又比7月份提高4.9％。8月份与4月份相比，钢的平均日产量提高50％，利用系数提高三点零五，作业率提高20.92％。
    鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉的群众性的表演竞赛，是从今年5月份开始的。这种表演竞赛主要是通过工人自己的生产操作实践来提高技术水平。但是在竞赛广泛展开以后，不仅工人的技术水平提高了，而且促进了工人相互比干劲，比智慧，比协作，形成全面提高思想，提高技术，提高生产的群众运动。它与当前盛行的对手赛和协作赛是互相促进，互相补充和互相丰富的。
    表演竞赛的形式有个人表演竞赛、交叉表演竞赛和集体表演竞赛等几种。表演的时候，新工人表演，老工人在旁边教；老工人表演，新工人在旁边学。表演以后，组织评比和鉴定，谁有优点，归纳提高以后在全厂推广，谁有缺点，帮助改进。这种表演竞赛，由于适合广大群众提高技术、提高生产的迫切要求，采用群众喜闻乐见的实地观摩现身说法的形式，所以参加表演竞赛的人不仅有先进生产者，有老工人，也有新工人和操作技术较差的工人。这种表演竞赛从平炉工段开始，后来其他工段也都纷纷参加表演。到目前为止，全体职工参加表演竞赛已达四万九千多人次，平均每个人参加表演将近二十次。
    这种表演竞赛，促使先进的更先进，落后的发奋图强赶上先进。二十一号平炉丁班炉长杨德荣，原来工作常落在别人后面，通过表演竞赛，他虚心向先进学习，工作积极主动，最近被评为先进生产者。
    在表演竞赛中，工人们通过自己的操作实践，迅速提高了技术水平。据平炉、铸锭、修炉三个工段的统计，技术水平提高一级和接近提高一级的有二百九十七人，有四十八人已正式提拔为工长、炉长、一助手和二助手。冯志泰等平炉工人在表演中运用和充实了苏联专家用钎子代替氧气打出钢口的操作方法，提高了工作效率十倍多，解决了生产上的关键问题。4月份因出钢口打不开耽误生产时间达七十一小时，7月份这种现象就大大减少了。
    表演竞赛也有效地提高了企业管理水平，改进了班与班、工段与工段之间的相互关系。厂长、工长、炉长和工人对表演竞赛都感到很满意。厂长满意连续超额完成国家计划；工长满意各工段各平炉协作好；炉长满意全炉工人干劲足；工人满意自己的技术水平提高快。
    据新华社鞍山11日电　鞍钢五座固定式平炉表演竞赛的经验，正在鞍钢各厂矿迅速推广和发展。目前，全鞍钢已有四十个生产厂矿推广了这项经验。
    许多厂矿通过表演竞赛，调动了职工群众的积极性和创造性，获得了思想、生产、技术全面丰收。第二炼钢厂十号平炉炉长栾德贵原来认为装入量增加到三百三十吨，用九小时出钢的表演，是不可能成功的；但是表演结果，仅用八点三十分钟就炼出来了。这一事实打破了他的保守思想，第二天他亲自要求表演，创造了用七点三十分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。焊管制品厂造管工段，在表演中总结和推广了工人创造的“三快一勤密装操作法”以及“三快一稳一准操作法”，使全工段操作水平普遍提高。这个工段在7月初欠产一百六十吨，到7月底不仅补上亏欠，而且还提前四小时完成了计划。
    这种表演竞赛，实际上是在现代化大企业内贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动经验的一个新发展，它可以吸收更多的群众参加到增产节约运动中来。中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委十分重视这项经验，曾号召各厂矿大力推广它，并且要求很好总结和提高它，使它更加完善。
