    At Tiananmen Square When the Lights Come On
    Zhang Pei
    Like a string of pearls inlaid on a laurel wreath, the brand-new and magnificent Tiananmen Square stands with rows of beautiful light posts in light yellow and light gray. When the sunset on the Western Hills disappears and the night gently falls, a milky white light drapes a layer of silver gauze over the square. Under this pure, soft, and intoxicating light, an atmosphere of tranquil solemnity spreads. Every granite stone, every row of square bricks, every Chinese pine, and every weeping willow on the square seems to be quietly, quietly waiting for a great moment – the tenth anniversary of our glorious republic.
    In recent days, how many people have come to Tiananmen Square at dusk, when the lights come on? Are you an old Beijinger who has spent decades here? Are you a demobilized soldier who participated in the founding ceremony of 1949? Are you a southern girl who has just been admitted to university and come to Beijing for the first time? You all seem to be strolling leisurely, but I know that in your hearts, the wind and rain of history are churning, and the flames of conquering the future are burning...
    Like many citizens of the capital, I often come to Tiananmen these days. Each time I come, my joy increases: the dense scaffolding has been removed from another side, and the light gray marble columns are exposed; another piece of granite has been paved; another row of small trees has been planted; another lamp post has been installed... One evening, I saw a painter climbing high, applying the last coat of paint to the huge canopy-like lampstand. Another evening, I was greeted by a transparent square inlaid with a string of pearls, the lights were on! The bright lights on the square brought joy to every passerby, and the passengers in the bus, even though they did not know each other, naturally exchanged words of praise. The lights not only emit light, but also the sound of our country's rapid progress. This pure, soft light also brings my thoughts back to a difficult era.
    In 1942, the revolutionary people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were experiencing a serious struggle. Japanese invaders shelled us from the east of the Yellow River, and the Kuomintang reactionaries tightly surrounded us from the south, west, and north. They had a despicable aim: to trap the Communist Party to death on the Loess Plateau. We lacked food and clothing, but we did not lack the revolutionary confidence to win. We reclaimed wasteland, we spun yarn, and we supported ourselves with our own hands. When it got dark, the plateau was vast, and we took a broken bowl from the wooden shelf in the cave, the bowl containing the last few cents of lamp oil. We took a small pinch of blackened cotton wool from our worn-out cotton trousers and twisted it into a wick, and then our cave had light. How weak the light was, but it helped us learn the truth of Marxism from books printed on rough malan grass paper. The smoke from the small oil lamp quickly blackened our nostrils, but before we could finish reading the last page, the oil ran out and the light went out. "How wonderful it would be to have a five-degree light bulb now." Someone in the darkness spoke in a playful and hopeful voice. "Of course, there will be light bulbs, just as the revolution is bound to win." This was the optimistic voice of all of us. Night gives way to dawn, and we lay down on the earthen kang and slept with firm belief.
    Today, as I joyfully stroll under the beautiful electric lights of Tiananmen Square, I miss those small oil lamps that accompanied thousands of revolutionaries in those difficult days. Small oil lamps, your weak light also contributed to the revolution, and also prepared for the construction and installation of those tall, solemn, and beautiful lamp posts erected in Tiananmen today.
    Strong spotlights illuminate the Great Hall of the People from below, making it sparkle. I approached this unparalleled great building of the country, gently touched the smooth marble columns with my hand, and looked again at the red and solemn national emblem hanging high on the eaves. I heard several passers-by next to me saying the same thing to each other: "It's really good, it's really fast!" This is a common comment from the citizens of the capital. In just ten months, our designers, engineers, and tens of thousands of construction workers created a building larger than the entire effective area of ​​the Forbidden City. Like a myth, a new people's palace suddenly grew from the ground. Those timid comrades who were skeptical of the great power of the masses to move mountains and seas and who were only good at pointing fingers, now take a look at this magnificent building built at high speed, don't you feel a little hot on your face?
    Under the graceful, lily-shaped lamp posts, I thought of the people advancing at high speed on another front—our steel workers. Friends, when we praise this grand and exquisite building, we will not forget that on the top of this complex building, there is a giant steel roof frame composed of twelve steel beams with a span of sixty meters. Without it, it would not be possible to build this ten-thousand-person hall without a single pillar. It was our steel workers who provided this huge steel roof frame. Perhaps you think this is a common thing, but if you know that only ten years ago, our industry could not only not provide such a large and complex steel roof frame for the construction industry, but even the floors, tiles, and copper handles on the doors used for building houses had to be transported from foreign countries. The bureaucratic bourgeoisie not only did not think this was a shame, but on the contrary, thought it was a sign of luxury and nobility.
    Now, there are many things that seem ordinary, but ten years ago, were considered impossible for Chinese people to do. Right here in Tiananmen Square, when the lights come on, we have found a clear mark of this earth-shattering change.
    The night is deep and the autumn wind is rustling. In the distance, the chimes of the brand-new and equally magnificent Beijing Railway Station strike rhythmically, as if celebrating the high-speed decisive victory of the construction workers in Beijing and from all over the country on the ten major construction projects in the capital; it is like singing happily for Beijing, which is dressed in new clothes.
    I got on the bus and went home along Chang'an Avenue, where the lights were on. I sat happily on the soft leather chair, watching the lamp posts receding quickly outside the window, next to a young mother holding a child who was sleeping sweetly, and in front and behind the car were a group of laughing, energetic young men and women. A sudden thought brought me back to a distant era.
    In 1939, a team of thousands of young men and women, like those on the bus now, responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and set off from Yan'an to the rear of the enemy. After a long march, the team crossed the Fen River. Then they passed through the blockade line of the Japanese invaders from the enemy strongholds near Taiyuan, walking one hundred and twenty li that night. It was a pitch-black autumn night, and the rapid march made people's legs sore, and excessive fatigue attacked everyone. If they lay down, they could fall asleep in a few seconds. But the will to fight was stronger than fatigue, and the team successfully broke through the blockade. When people crossed the Tongpu Railway, someone bent down and touched the cold steel rails in the dark with his hand. He didn't speak, but everyone was saying in their hearts: We must have trains, we must have cars, we must have airplanes in the future...
    The bus sped along the avenue at night, and my thoughts returned from yesterday to today and tomorrow. Today we can already manufacture locomotives, manufacture cars, and manufacture airplanes ourselves, but the achievements we have achieved are only a beginning compared to the goals we will achieve in the future. The road is still long, the struggle must continue, but we will definitely be able to reach our predetermined goals ahead of schedule with high-speed steps.
    The car stopped, and the enthusiastic voice of the attendant told me: We've arrived!

    在华灯初放的天安门
    张沛
    像在桂冠上镶起一溜溜珍珠，崭新壮丽的天安门广场，竖起了一行行淡黄色浅灰色的美丽灯柱。当西山的晚霞消失，夜幕轻轻落下的时候，一片乳白色的灯光，给广场披上了一层银色的轻纱。在这纯洁的、柔和的、令人陶醉的灯光下，散布着一种安谧的肃穆气氛。广场上的每一块花岗石，每一行方砖；每一株油松，每一棵垂柳，似乎都在静静地、静静地等待着一个伟大的时刻——我们光荣的共和国的十周年。
    近些日子，有多少人乘着黄昏来到这华灯初放的天安门呵，你是在这里度过几十个春秋的老北京？你是参加过1949年建国大典的转业战士？你是一个刚刚考进大学第一回来到北京的南方姑娘？你们似乎都在悠闲地散步，可是我知道在你们的心里，正翻腾着历史的风雨，正燃烧着征服未来的火焰……。
    像许多首都的公民一样，这些天我常常来到天安门。每来一次，都增加一次喜悦：密密麻麻的脚手架子又拆除了一面，浅灰色的大理石圆柱露出来了；花岗石又铺好了一片；小树又栽上了一行；灯柱又安上了一个……。一个黄昏，我看见油漆工爬得高高的，在庞大的华盖似的灯架上涂上了最后一遍油。又一个黄昏，迎接我的是镶上了一串串珍珠的透明的广场，灯亮了！广场上的明灯，给每个过路人带来了欢乐，公共汽车里的乘客虽然互不认识，也都自然地交换一句赞美的语言。灯放出的不只是光明，还放出了我们国家飞速前进的脚步声。这洁白的、柔美的灯光呵，也把我的思考带回到一个艰难的年代。
    1942年，陕甘宁边区的革命人民经历着一场严重的斗争。日本侵略者从黄河东面向我们炮击，国民党反动派从南面、西面、北面紧紧地包围着我们。他们怀着一个卑鄙的目的：把共产党困死在陕北高原。我们缺乏粮食也缺乏衣服，但我们丝毫不缺乏革命的必胜信心。我们开荒，我们纺线，我们用自己的双手养活自己。天黑下来了，高原上一片苍茫，我们从窑洞的木板架上，取下一个破碗，碗里装着最后的几钱灯油。从破棉裤里掏出一小撮发黑的棉絮，搓成一个灯捻，于是，我们的窑洞里有了光明。多么微弱的光呵，然而它帮助我们从用粗糙的马兰草纸印的书籍上，学习马克思主义的真理。小油灯的烟很快把我们的鼻孔熏黑了，但没有等我们读完最后一页，油尽了，灯灭了。“如果现在有一个五度的电灯多好呵。”黑暗中有人用俏皮的希望的声音说话。“电灯当然会有的，就像革命必然要胜利一样。”这是我们所有人的乐观的声音。黑夜过去就是黎明，我们怀着坚强的信念在土炕上躺下睡了。
    今天，当我喜悦地在天安门广场的优美的电灯光下散步的时候，我怀念起在那些艰难的日子里，曾经和千千万万的革命者作过侣伴的那些小油灯。小油灯呵，你微弱的光芒也为革命出过力，也为今天在天安门竖立那些高大的、庄严的、美丽的灯柱作过建设和施工的准备。
    强烈的聚光灯从下往上把人民大会堂照得闪闪发光。我走近这个举国无比的伟大建筑，用手轻轻地摸摸那些光滑的大理石圆柱，再看看高高悬在屋檐上的红色的庄严的国徽，我听到在我旁边的几个过路人互相说着同样的话：“真好呀，真快呀！”这是首都公民们的共同的评语。仅仅十个月，我们的设计师、工程师和成万的建筑工人，造成了一座比故宫的全部有效面积还要大的建筑，像神话一样，突然从地面上长出一座新的人民的宫殿。那些胆怯的、对群众移山倒海的伟大力量抱着怀疑态度的、只善于指指划划的可悲的同志，现在你们看一眼这个高速度建成的雄伟建筑，脸上不觉得有些发烧吗？
    在玉兰花形的婷婷玉立的灯柱下，我想起了另一条战线上高速度前进的人们——我们的钢铁工人。朋友，当我们赞美这座宏大的精美的建筑时，我们不会忘记在这个结构复杂的大建筑的顶上，有一个由十二榀钢梁组成的、六十米跨度的巨型钢屋架，没有它，就不可能建造起这个没有一根柱子的万人大厅。是我们的钢铁工人提供了这个巨大的钢屋架。也许你觉得这是一件平常的事，可是如果你知道仅仅十年以前，我国的工业，不仅不能为建筑业提供这样庞大复杂的钢屋架，就是造房子用的地板、瓷砖和门上的铜把子也都要从外国运来。官僚资产阶级，非但不以为这是一种羞耻，相反认为这是一种豪华和高贵的标志。
    在现在，有许许多多看起来是平常的事，而在十年以前，是被认为中国人绝不可能办到的事。就在这华灯初放的天安门，我们找到了这种天翻地覆的大变化的鲜明标记。
    夜已深，秋风飒飒。远处，全新的同样宏伟的北京车站的钟声有节凑地敲打着，它像是庆贺北京的和来自全国各地的建筑工人，在首都的十大建筑工程上取得了高速度的决定性胜利；它像是为披上新装的北京在欢乐歌唱。
    我踏上了公共汽车，沿着灯光齐放的长安街回家了。我愉快地坐在柔软的皮椅上，注视着窗外一个个飞快后退的灯柱，旁边是一个年轻的母亲抱着正在甜睡的孩子，车前车后是一群谈笑着的充满着活力的男女青年。一个突然的思念又把我带回到一个遥远的年代。
    1939年，一支几千人就像现在汽车上的这样年青的男女，响应党中央的号召，从延安出发到敌人后方去。经过长途的行军，队伍过了汾河。接着就从太原附近的敌人据点中间穿过日本侵略者的封锁线，这一晚走了一百二十里。这是一个漆黑的秋夜，急行军使得人们两腿酸麻，过度的疲劳袭击着每一个人，如果躺下来，在几秒钟内就可呼呼入睡。可是斗争的意志比疲劳还要顽强，队伍胜利地突破了封锁。当人们跨过同蒲路的时候，有人弯下腰在黑暗中用手摸了摸冰凉的钢轨。他没有说话，可是每个人的心里都在说话：我们将来一定要有火车、要有汽车、要有飞机……。
    公共汽车在夜晚的大道上急速奔驰，我的思念又从昨天回到了今天和明天。我们今天已经能自己制造火车头、制造汽车、制造飞机了，可是我们所达到的成就和我们将来所要达到的目标比较起来，还只是一个开头呵。路还长，斗争还要继续，但我们一定能用高速度的步伐，提前达到我们预定的目标。
    车子停了，服务员热情的声音告诉我：到站了！
