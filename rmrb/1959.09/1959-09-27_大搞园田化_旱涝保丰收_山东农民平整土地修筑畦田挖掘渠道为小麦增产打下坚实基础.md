    Vigorously Engage in Garden-like Fields for Guaranteed Harvests Regardless of Drought or Flood
    Shandong Farmers Level Land, Build Raised Fields, and Dig Channels to Lay a Solid Foundation for Increased Wheat Production
    (Our report) Shandong is combining deep plowing and deep turning of the soil with land leveling, building raised fields, and digging channels, vigorously developing garden-like fields to lay a foundation for a guaranteed bumper wheat harvest next year, regardless of drought or flood. Currently, millions of people across the province are engaged in the autumn planting campaign, working diligently in the fields. By September 19th, over 31 million mu of land had been plowed and over 7.4 million mu had been sown. According to statistics from the four regions of Liaocheng, Linyi, Changwei, and Jinan, over 9 million mu of deeply plowed land have already been leveled, and raised fields and channel systems have been built on over 7 million mu. Liaocheng Prefecture, which has made rapid progress, is vigorously promoting the "three transformations" project of land leveling, standardization of raised fields, and systematization of channels. The entire prefecture has plowed over 5 million mu of land, of which over 3 million mu meet the requirements for standardization of raised fields.
    From the facts of bumper wheat harvests in recent years, especially this year, the people of Shandong have deeply realized the important role of garden-like fields in fully utilizing land fertility, developing water conservancy efficiency, fully implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and guaranteeing increased production. In the Prosperity Production Team of the Matou People's Commune in Tancheng County, Linyi Prefecture, 300 mu of wheat were transformed into garden-like fields last autumn, facilitating irrigation and ensuring even watering, resulting in an average yield of 454 jin per mu this year. However, 66 mu of wheat with water access that were not developed into raised fields, despite the same management measures, yielded only 280 jin per mu due to inconvenient and uneven watering. In the Liaocheng area, during the vigorous campaign to create garden-like fields, the method of recalling and comparing was used to help the commune members calculate the benefits of garden-like fields. For example, last year, irrigating a mu of garden-like field required only 1.16 workdays and 30 cubic meters of water, with thorough and even watering. Irrigating land without raised fields required 3.2 workdays and 50 cubic meters of water, with uneven and incomplete watering. According to this calculation, if all 5.46 million mu of high-yield wheat land in the area were to achieve the "three transformations," it would save over 10 million workdays and hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water during field management. This year, Shandong Province increased its irrigated area by 13.46 million mu, bringing the total irrigated area to over 71 million mu. At the same time, large-scale water conservancy projects will be carried out this winter and next spring, with utilization following development. However, field water conservancy projects such as land leveling are far behind the requirements of agricultural production development. Based on past experience in increasing production and the development of water conservancy construction this year, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels plan to implement garden-like fields on a portion of the province's 70 million mu of wheat area, and require another portion to reach the level of raised fields.
    When carrying out this project, people's communes in various regions made comprehensive plans based on terrain, soil quality, water sources, and other conditions, with unified layouts, unified standards, and unified arrangements for water conservancy systems. They broke down county and commune boundaries, cooperated with each other, and fully utilized the superiority of the people's communes. The general standard requirement for garden-like fields is: channels connected to channels, squares connected to squares, with effective water storage, irrigation, and drainage. Large and small channels are connected into a network, the land is as flat as a mirror, the ridges are as straight as lines, paths are made on the ridges, ensuring accessibility in all directions, guaranteeing a bumper harvest regardless of drought or flood. In terms of specific operations, various regions adopted different measures according to local conditions. For example, in generally flat land, mechanically irrigated areas, or gravity-fed irrigation areas, the ridges should be wider and the field bodies longer. In uneven terrain or water-lift irrigation areas, the ridges should be narrower and the field bodies shorter. In Liaocheng Prefecture, each county divided the prefecture's 5.46 million mu of high-yield land into sixteen high-yield areas, 180 thousand-mu high-yield squares, and more than 2,500 hundred-mu high-yield plots, with each square and plot becoming a raised field. Through land consolidation and ridge formation, the Old Zhao Village Commune in Linqing City also eliminated 160 small roads and expanded cultivated land by 300 mu.
    When carrying out this work, Party committees at all levels set up demonstration points at each level, created models, and held on-site meetings for comprehensive promotion, so that the garden-like field campaign quickly formed a high tide with the development of the "Three Autumns" work. Under the slogan of "Work in shifts day and night, plant wheat well to seize super-production, and welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country," cadres and the masses went into action together, creating a lively competition everywhere among communes, teams, and individuals, all striving to be the best. After the on-site meetings in Yishui and Tancheng in Linyi Prefecture, the flames of competition to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced spread throughout the region. In Yishui County, 400,000 laborers were投入into the garden-like field competition, building more than 1,900 battle sheds in the fields, with more than 60,000 people eating and living in the fields, quickly consolidating the channel projects of 160,000 mu of land. In Tancheng County's Baihe Commune, 5,800 of the commune's 7,000 households have already made competition plans. Linyi City divided the city into eight major battle zones to vigorously develop garden-like fields, with county party secretaries or standing committee members taking command in each zone.
    In the garden-like field campaign, the broad masses of cadres and commune members displayed the spirit of combining hard work and skillful work, creating and reforming many advanced tools, which multiplied labor efficiency. For example, the ridge-building machine created in Heze County, operated by two people and pulled by one animal, could build 96 mu of raised fields in eight hours, equivalent to the work of 60 people for one day. Many good methods have also been studied in the process of leveling the ground and operating. For example, according to the terrain planning, leveling in sections, leveling the high ground in the middle from the middle to both ends, and cutting high and filling low in uneven ground all effectively saved labor and improved quality and efficiency.

    大搞园田化　旱涝保丰收
    山东农民平整土地修筑畦田挖掘渠道为小麦增产打下坚实基础
    本报讯　山东各地结合深耕深翻土地，平整土地，修筑畦田，挖掘渠道，大搞田园化，为明年小麦打下旱涝保丰收的基础。现在全省数百万秋种大军，奋战田间。到9月19日，全省已翻耕土地三千一百多万亩，播种七百四十多万亩。据聊城、临沂、昌潍、济南等四个地区统计，深翻地已经平整的地面达九百多万亩，修筑畦田、渠系的有七百多万亩。进展较快的聊城专区，大搞土地平整化、畦田标准化、渠道系统化的“三化”工程，全区已经翻地五百多万亩，其中有三百多万亩符合畦田标准化的要求。
    山东人民从历年来特别是今年小麦大丰收的事实中，深深体会到园田化在充分发挥地力、发展水利效能、全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，保证增产上所起的重要作用。临沂专区郯城县码头人民公社繁荣生产队，去秋已有三百亩小麦实现了园田化，灌溉方便、浇水均匀，今年平均亩产四百五十四斤；而有水浇条件没有整成畦田的六十六亩小麦，由于浇水不便、不匀，同样管理措施，亩产二百八十斤。聊城地区在大搞园田化运动中，采用回忆对比的办法，启发广大社员算了园田化的好处账。如去年在园田里浇一次水，每亩只用一点一十六个工日，三十方水，浇的又透又匀；没有畦田的地浇一次水，每亩须用三点二个工日，五十方水，浇的不透不匀。全区依此计算，如果把五百四十六万亩丰产麦，全部实现“三化”，在进行田间管理时，就可省工一千多万个，省水数亿方。今年山东全省，增加了灌溉面积一千三百四十六万亩，连同以前的灌溉面积达七千一百多万亩，同时今冬明春又要大搞水利，随开发还要随利用，但是土地平整等田间水利工程，却远远跟不上农业生产发展的要求。中共山东省委和各级党委根据过去增产经验和今年水利建设发展的情况，计划在全省七千万亩小麦面积上，把其中一部分丰产田实行园田化，一部分要求达到畦田化。
    各地人民公社在进行这项工程时，都根据地势、土质、水源等条件，作了全面规划，统一布局，统一标准，统一安排水利系统，打破县界、社界、互相协作，充分发挥人民公社的优越性。园田化的一般标准要求是：渠连渠，方连方，蓄灌排泄都管用，大小渠道连成网；地平如镜，埂直如线，就埂做路，四通八达，保证旱涝都丰收。具体操作上，各地因地制宜，采取不同措施。例如在一般平坦的土地、机灌区或自流灌溉区，畦埂要宽些，畦身要长些；在地势不平或提水灌区，畦埂要窄些，畦身要短些。聊城专区各县把全区五百四十六万亩丰产田划分为十六个丰产区，一百八十个千亩丰产方，二千五百多个百亩丰产片，方方块块皆成畦。临清市老赵庄公社通过整地打畦，还消灭了一百六十条小道，扩大耕地三百亩。
    各级党委在进行这一工作时，层层设点，作出样子，召开现场会全面推广，使园田化运动，随着三秋工作的开展，迅速形成高潮。在“白天晚上轮番干，种好小麦夺超产，迎接建国十周年”的口号下，干部群众一齐上阵，到处形成社与社、队与队、人与人之间你追我赶齐争上游的热烈竞赛局面。临沂专区在沂水、郯城召开现场会议后，学先进、赶先进、超先进的竞赛烈火燃遍全区。沂水县投入园田化竞赛运动的有四十万劳力，在田间搭起一千九百多个战棚，有六万多人吃住在田间，迅速整好了十六万亩土地的渠道工程。郯城县白河公社全社七千户，已有五千八百户订出竞赛计划。临沂市将全市划分为八大战区大搞园田化，区区都有县委书记或常委挂帅。
    广大干部社员在园田化运动中，发挥了苦干和巧干相结合的精神，创造和改制了许多先进工具，使劳动效率成倍提高。如菏泽县创造的筑畦器，两人操作，一个牲口牵引，八小时做成畦田九十六亩，能顶六十人干一天。在平整地面和操作过程中，也研究出很多好办法。如根据地形规划，分段整平，当中高的地，从中间向两头整，高洼不平的地削高填洼，都有效地节省了劳力，提高了质量和效率。
