Don't Do the Yangko Dance Against the Revolution
　　Liǔ Dí

　　The situation in our country is truly excellent! The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have just been published, and a massive, powerful mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy has rapidly taken shape across the country. Recently, I visited some cities and villages in the Northeast. Whether at the steelmaking furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, the open-pit coal mines of Fushun, or the people's communes of the Great Northern Wilderness, what I saw was nothing but a thriving revolutionary competition and a vibrant scene, truly a surging tide and a towering heat wave. People have been encouraged and strengthened by the Party's call. Under the illumination of the Party's General Line, their revolutionary enthusiasm has been further boosted, the pace of the leap forward has become faster and faster, and the revolutionary steps have become even more firm.

　　Seeing this excellent situation of continued leap forward, one cannot help but feel even more the despicable ridiculousness of those right-leaning opportunists in our ranks. While the people are enthusiastically making a great leap forward, they gesticulate, spew saliva, and endlessly spout fallacies, throwing cold water on the masses, spreading laxity and pessimistic sentiments, and attempting to demoralize the army and weaken the fighting spirit. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of the people have always been full of confidence and courage in our great leap forward. People use a strong revolutionary will to sweep away all decadent right-leaning emotions and stride forward.

　　Here, one cold and one hot, shows the two different attitudes of people towards the revolution. True communists have always been strong-willed and full of confidence in their revolutionary cause, resolutely obeying the leadership of the Party and safeguarding the interests of the Party. They would rather have their heads cut off and blood flow, but their will cannot be bent, and they firmly move towards lofty goals. They are born with a backbone of steel, can withstand the tempering of deep waters and scorching heat, resist the attacks of storms, and firmly stand in the ranks of the revolution, without pessimism or wavering, like the towering Mount Tai. This is a valuable revolutionary firmness. However, the attitude of those right-leaning opportunists towards the revolution is completely different. They have neither strong beliefs nor perseverance. On the road of revolution, when they encounter a little difficulty, they sigh and hesitate, or even swagger. These people are simply like Zhu Bajie in "Journey to the West." Although that Bajie also had a vague desire to obtain scriptures, helped carry luggage and take things along the way, and even made some contributions in struggles such as the "Great Battle of the Flowing Sand River" and "Assisting in Defeating the Demon King," he still could not withstand the test of risk, and often wanted to return to his old home, Gao Village, in the face of difficulties. Aren't those right-leaning opportunists also often pessimistic, disappointed, and timid? They are dissatisfied with the leadership of the Party and the Party's General Line. They don't say it, but they have their own world in their hearts, opposing the Party. Look at their affected and coy expressions; they are sometimes silent, suspicious, and wait-and-see about the revolutionary cause, sometimes passive and pessimistic, gesticulating and commenting, and when they see some minor shortcomings and encounter difficulties, they even exaggerate, slander, and attack the Party. They boast that they have always been correct, but in reality, they are wavering, doing the yangko dance in their revolutionary attitude.

　　Doing the yangko dance in political attitude is a dangerous opportunistic behavior. Tilted to the east and west, sometimes to the left and sometimes to the right, sometimes sitting on this side and sometimes sitting on that side, this is a question of a revolutionary's position. If one cannot sit firmly in the position of the proletariat, one will naturally not be able to recognize the lofty goals of the revolution, see the great future of the revolution, let alone use an indomitable revolutionary will to realize the great ideal of communism and loyally safeguard the cause of the Party. They are unstable and unable to be of one heart and mind with the Party and the people, and in the end, they can only break away from the Party and the people and "twist" into the mud pit of the bourgeoisie. Right-leaning opportunists slander the revolutionary mass movement as a "petty-bourgeois fanatic movement," but in reality, it is their own bourgeois nature in their thinking that has not been thoroughly transformed, which has caused them to be unable to be wholeheartedly loyal to the Party, to waver in the revolutionary cause, and even to be abandoned by the wheels of history.

    莫对革命扭秧歌
  　柳笛
    我们国家的形势真是好得很！党的八届八中全会的公报和决议刚刚公布不久，一个声势浩大、雷霆万钧的增产节约的群众运动，已经在全国范围内迅速形成了。最近，我到过东北的一些城市和农村，无论是在鞍钢的炼钢炉前、在抚顺的露天煤矿或是在北大荒的人民公社，看到的无不是如火如荼的革命竞赛和欣欣向荣的景象，真是高潮滚滚，热浪滔滔。人们从党的号召中受到了鼓舞，增添了力量，在党的总路线照耀下革命干劲越鼓越足，跃进的速度越来越快，革命的步伐也更加坚定起来了。
    看到这种继续跃进的大好形势，不能不愈加感到在我们的队伍里的那一些右倾机会主义分子的可耻可笑。人民群众热情澎湃地大跃进，他们却指手划脚、唾液四溅、喋喋不休地大发谬论，向群众迎头泼来冷水，散布松劲、悲观情绪，企图涣散军心，削减斗志。然而，广大的人民群众在党的领导下对我们的大跃进却始终是信心百倍、勇气十足的。人们用坚强的革命意志横扫一切沉腐的右倾情绪，大踏步地继续向前挺进。
    这里，一冷一热，表现了人们对待革命的两种不同的态度。真正的共产主义者对于自己的革命事业从来都是意志坚强、信心十足，坚决服从党的领导，保卫党的利益的。他们头可断、血可流、志不可屈，坚强地一直向着崇高目标走去。他们生就一身硬骨头，经得起水深火热的锻炼，抵得住狂风暴雨的袭击，坚决地站在革命的行列中，不悲观、不动摇，好比屹立的泰山。这是一种可贵的革命坚定性。但是，那些右倾机会主义分子对待革命的态度却完全不同了。他们既无坚强的信念，又无坚忍不拔的毅力，在革命的道路上，遇到一点困难，便唉声叹气，裹足不前，甚至大摇大摆。这些人简直就像“西游记”里的猪八戒一样。那八戒虽然也有模模糊糊的取经要求，一路上帮助担担行李，拿拿东西，甚至在“大战流沙河”和“助力败魔王”等斗争中也有一些功绩，但总还是经受不住风险的考验，在困难面前动不动就要回老家高老庄了。那些右倾机会主义分子不是也常常表现得悲观失望，畏缩不前吗？他们对于党的领导和党的总路线心怀不满，嘴上不说，心里却另有天地，和党对立。你瞧他们那股忸怩作态的神情；他们对于革命的事业有时沉默不语、怀疑、观望，有时消极悲观，指手划脚论长论短，而当他们看到某些微小的缺点和遇到困难时，甚至夸大、诽谤，向党攻击起来了。他们自诩为一贯正确，而实际上却是摇摆不定，在革命态度上扭起秧歌舞来了。
    在政治态度上扭起秧歌舞，这是一种危险的机会主义行为。东倒西歪，忽左忽右，一会儿屁股坐在这边，一会儿屁股又坐那边，这是一个革命者的立场问题。不能把屁股稳实地坐在无产阶级的立场上来，自然就认不清革命的崇高目标，看不见革命的远大前途，更谈不到用百折不挠的革命意志去实现共产主义的伟大理想，忠心耿耿地保卫党的事业了。他们动摇不定、不能和党和人民始终一条心，到后来就只有脱离党、脱离人民，“扭”到资产阶级的泥坑里去了。右倾机会主义者把革命的群众运动诬为“小资产阶级的狂热性运动”，而实际上正是他们自己思想上的资产阶级的本性没有得到彻底改造，才造成了他们对党不能赤胆忠心，对革命事业东摇西摆，甚至不得不被历史的车轮所抛弃了。
