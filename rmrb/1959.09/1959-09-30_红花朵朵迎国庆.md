The broad masses of workers in Shandong Province are actively carrying out technical innovation movements in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, dedicating their achievements to National Day.

    Forty-Horsepower Wooden Tugboat
    Workers at the Qingdao Shipbuilding and Repair Plant, with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, experimented with the "fast shipbuilding method" and built a forty-horsepower wooden tugboat in nineteen days.
    This wooden tugboat can tow ninety-ton cargo barges and also carry ten to sixteen tons of cargo itself. Its speed can reach 6.8 to 7 nautical miles per hour, which is faster and has greater towing power than iron tugboats of the same horsepower. Because the workers improved the keel design, the boat can maintain good stability when sailing in force six winds and waves. Due to the solid hull structure, it is expected to be able to navigate at sea for eight years without caulking or replacing planks.

    New Method of Extracting Coal Tar
    The Linyi Coal Mine Coking Plant and the Industrial Department of the Scientific Research Institute jointly collaborated to add exhaust fans to the coke ovens and improve the exhaust duct, increasing the oil extraction rate by 49.7%.
    In the past, the plant's seventy-five-ton coke ovens used natural ventilation, and could only extract 150 to 220 kilograms of oil each time. Now, they have changed the original "spoke" shaped exhaust duct arrangement to a "leaf vein" shaped exhaust duct to reduce gas flow resistance, and added a manually operated exhaust fan, which greatly increased the oil extraction rate of the coke ovens. Previously, each ton of coal could only produce 1.8 kilograms of oil. After this improvement, each ton of coal can produce 3 kilograms of oil.

    Wind-Powered Tobacco Feeding
    In the past, the Jinan Cigarette Factory had a tobacco-feeding worker for each cigarette machine. Recently, they successfully trial-produced a wind-powered tobacco-feeding machine that can add tobacco to six cigarette machines simultaneously, saving twelve workers (based on two shifts). After testing, the use of wind-powered feeding resulted in even and consistent tobacco distribution, improving product quality.

    Electrolytic Capacitor Paper
    A special paper for the electrical appliance industry – electrolytic capacitor paper – has been successfully trial-produced at the Shandong Paper Mill.
    This type of paper used to be imported from foreign countries. The factory's workers worked day and night conducting experiments and research, and after several changes in formula and equipment improvements, they recently produced electrolytic capacitor paper that meets the required specifications. The factory has now produced more than 30 tons of finished products, which has promptly met market needs.

    Good Equipment for Small Sugar Mills
    A set of small sugar-making machines (including a hand-cranked shredder and a foot-operated centrifuge) has been successfully trial-produced at the Zhoucun Machinery Factory. This set of sugar-making machines can equip a small sugar mill, capable of processing 5,000 jin of sugar beets daily and producing 800 jin of sugar.
    Currently, the factory is stepping up production of forty shredders and eighty centrifuges according to the national plan, to meet the needs of dozens of newly built and expanded county and commune small sugar mills.

    红花朵朵迎国庆
    山东省广大职工在增产节约运动中，积极开展技术革新运动，向国庆献礼。
    四十马力木拖轮
    青岛船舶修造厂职工，以冲天的革命干劲，试行“快速造船法”，十九天造成了四十马力木质拖轮。
    这只木质拖轮，能拖九十吨货驳船，还能自载十吨至十六吨货物，每小时航速可达六点八至七海里，比同样马力的铁质拖轮航速快，拖力大。由于职工们改进了龙骨设计，该轮在六级风浪里行驶时能保持很好的稳定性；由于船体结构坚固，预计可以在海内航行八年而不需要捻缝和挂换船板。
    抽焦油的新办法
    临沂煤矿焦厂和科学研究所工业系共同协作，在焦炉上增设抽风机，改进排气孔道，出油率比原来提高49.7％。
    过去该厂七十五吨容积的焦炉，采取自然抽风，每次只能抽油一百五十公斤到二百二十公斤。现在，他们把原来按“车辐”形排列的排气孔道，改成“叶脉”形的排气孔道，以减少气体流通阻力，并增设了人力转动的抽风机，使焦炉的出油率大大增加。原先每吨煤只能出油一点八公斤，经这样改进后，每吨煤可出油三公斤。风力送烟丝
    济南烟厂过去每台卷烟机上都有一个加丝工。最近试制成功一种风力送丝机，能给六台卷烟机同时加添烟丝，可以节省出十二个人（按两班计算）。经过试验，采用风力送丝，下的烟丝均匀一致，提高了产品质量。
    电解电容器纸
    一种电器工业专用纸张——电解电容器纸，已在山东造纸总厂试制成功。
    这种纸张过去要从国外进口。该厂职工夜以继日地进行试验研究，经数次改变配方和改进设备，已在最近制成了达到规格要求的电解电容器纸。这个厂现在已生产出成品三十多吨，及时供应了市场需要。
    小糖厂的好装备
    一套小型制糖机（包括手摇切丝机、脚踏离心机），已在周村机械厂试制成功。这套制糖机可装备一个小型糖厂，每日能处理五千斤甜菜，产八百斤食糖。
    目前，这个厂正按照国家计划，突击生产四十部切丝机和八十部离心机，供应几十个新建和扩建的县社小型制糖厂的需要。
