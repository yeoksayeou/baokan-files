    No Trace of Drought Found
    Ning Yongkui, Secretary of the Guicun People's Commune Party Committee, Xuchang County

    For seventy-four days, from June 8th to August 22nd, not a drop of rain fell in the Guicun People's Commune, Xuchang County, Henan Province. The drought was comparable to that of 1942. But in 1942, people left their homes and villages, and the scene was one of tragic horror. This year? Thanks to the leadership of the Party, the great superiority of the People's Commune has been brought into play, and the effectiveness of water conservancy projects has been fully utilized. The entire commune has watered its 17,000 mu of early autumn crops three to five times. They have now been harvested and stored, with an average yield of 210 jin per mu, exceeding the original contracted output target of 180 jin by more than 10 percent. The more than 44,000 mu of late autumn crops are growing well after a hard-fought battle against drought. Everywhere you can see thick corn cobs, foxtail millet taller than early millet, green sweet potato vines covering the fields, and golden tobacco leaves spreading their fragrance. It is truly a scene of abundance, and nowhere can you find the slightest trace of drought!

    This year, as soon as signs of drought appeared, the Commune Party Committee led the masses in a do-or-die struggle against it with overwhelming force. The commune put forward a resounding slogan for drought resistance: "A hundred waterwheels converge, five dragons stir the hills, conquer nature, and vow to win a bumper harvest!"

    The entire commune mobilized more than 13,700 people to participate in the drought resistance struggle, digging nine branch canals, 114 feeder canals, and 702 pits and ponds, repairing 682 old wells, and expanding the irrigated area by 12,500 mu in addition to the original 32,000 mu of irrigated land.

    The 250 employees of the commune's seven mechanical repair shops produced 587 various water-lifting tools and repaired more than 6,000 tools of various kinds for the commune in two months. Many technicians lived in various production teams, both fighting the drought and repairing tools.

    The People's Commune organized mutual cooperation between management areas and production teams, which exerted great power in the fight against drought. A total of 3,600 laborers, 40 waterwheels, and more than 16,000 other water conservancy tools participated in the collaboration across the commune. For example, the Dusongzhuang Production Brigade was located on a hillside, making it difficult to draw water and lacking labor and tools. At this time, the commune organized 85 laborers from the Aizhuang Brigade to go to support the Dusongzhuang Production Brigade with tools. After three days and three nights of fighting, they dug five canals and brought water up the hill. The Dusongzhuang Brigade then supported the Aizhuang Brigade with ten head of livestock to pull waterwheels. Both teams completed their watering and drought resistance tasks. The Yuwangling Brigade needed to dig a canal from the south of the ridge to bring water to the hill, but the project was arduous. Therefore, the entire commune organized 2,300 strong laborers from 22 brigades to form a large corps to support the Yuwangling Brigade in fighting the drought. In fifteen days, three canals were dug, completing the Yuwangling water diversion and irrigation plan.

    In August, the drought became more and more serious. Many pits and ponds dried up, and the well water level dropped. Only three flows of water were released from the Baisha Reservoir, and a few team cadres and members were competing for water. The commune immediately convened a water use coordination meeting and formulated a water use system of watering downstream first, then upstream, watering early autumn crops first, and then late autumn crops. This fully exerted the drought resistance capacity of the water.

    This is a great movement to resist drought and ensure a bumper harvest. Many elderly commune members were moved by this drought resistance struggle. An eighty-year-old commune member, Yang Dexiu, excitedly said: "Only the power of the People's Commune can withstand this drought!"

    找不到受旱的痕迹
    许昌县桂村人民公社党委书记　宁永魁
    河南许昌县桂村人民公社从6月8日到8月22日的七十四天内滴雨不落，干旱程度和1942年不相上下。可是在1942年，人们离乡背井，到处一片悲惨的可怕景象。今年呢？由于在党的领导下，发挥了人民公社的巨大优越性，充分运用了水利工程的效能，全公社早秋作物一万七千亩普遍浇水三至五遍，现已收打入库，平均每亩产粮二百一十斤，超过原订包产指标一百八十斤的一成多；晚秋作物四万四千多亩，经过艰苦的抗旱斗争，目前生长良好，到处可以看到粗大的玉米棒子，狼尾巴般的晚谷超过早谷，青绿的甘薯秧覆盖田垅，金黄色的烟叶到处散发香味，真是一幅丰收的景象，那里能找到丝毫受旱的痕迹！
    今年，旱象刚露头，公社党委就带领群众，以翻江倒海的气势同干旱作誓死的斗争。公社提出了响亮的抗旱口号：“百车（水车）会师，五龙闹岗，征服自然，誓夺丰收。”
    全公社出动一万三千七百多人投入抗旱斗争，抗旱中挖支渠九条，毛渠一百十四条，坑塘七百零二个，修老井六百八十二眼，除原浇地三万二千亩外，又扩大灌溉面积一万二千五百亩。
    全公社七个机械修配厂的二百五十名职工，在两个月中，为公社生产各种提水工具五百八十七件，修制各种工具六千多件，许多技术工人，分住在各生产队，边抗旱，边修理工具。
    人民公社组织各管理区、生产队之间相互协作，在抗旱中发挥了巨大威力。全社参加协作的劳力有三千六百人，水车四十部，以及其他水利工具一万六千多件。如杜宋庄生产大队是岗地，引水困难，又缺乏劳力、工具，这时公社就组织艾庄大队的八十五名劳力，带着工具去支援杜宋庄生产大队，经过三天三夜战斗，挖引水渠五条，引水翻沟上岗。杜宋庄大队则支援艾庄大队十头牲口拉水车，这两个队都完成了浇地抗旱的任务。禹王岭大队需要从岭南挖渠引水上岗，但是工程艰巨，于是全公社组织了二十二个大队共二千三百名壮劳力，成立了一个大兵团，支援禹王岭大队抗旱。十五天中共挖渠三条，完成了禹王岭引水灌溉的计划。
    8月，旱象越来越严重，许多坑塘干涸，井水下降，只有白沙水库放来三个流量的水，少数队干部和社员有争着用水的现象。公社立即召开了用水协作会议，制定了先浇下游、后浇上游，先浇早秋、后浇晚秋等用水制度，这样就充分地发挥了这些水的抗旱能力。
    这是一场伟大的抗旱保丰收的运动，许多年老的社员都被这场抗旱斗争所感动。一位八十多岁的社员杨德修兴奋地说：“只有人民公社的力量才能抗得住这场旱灾啊！”
