Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 9th: The members of the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang, Henan, are earnestly studying the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, greatly increasing their drive and taking more measures, determined to increase cotton production by another 2.8 million jin this year on the basis of the originally planned cotton production. In order to achieve this goal, more than 42,000 commune members throughout the commune have formulated their own leap forward plans, and more than 20,000 people have submitted letters of determination to the commune Party committee.

The commune cadres and the masses fully analyzed the current production situation, believing that this year's cotton, due to proper management measures, grasped the key to increased production in each management period, resulting in more fruit branches, more cotton bolls, more young bolls and flower buds, and a longer growing period. As long as the later management is strengthened and the autumn and late bolls are vigorously grasped, the potential for increased production is still very large. The teams have further established their confidence in completing the overproduction tasks and have generally revised their plans. The whole commune has planted 93,500 mu of cotton. After the revision, the planned yield per mu has been increased from the original 130 jin to 160 jin. Their specific measures are: fight the drought to the end, ensure a bumper harvest without rain, and generally water all cotton fields again; completely defeat the late-stage pests, treat them as soon as they appear, and resolutely prevent cotton from losing buds and reducing production due to pests; launch a crash program to apply fertilizer, requiring each mu of cotton field to be fertilized with another ten jin of chemical fertilizer; rush to pick every cotton boll during the flowering season, ensuring that no bolls are left on the plants, no flowers are dropped on the road, and every boll returns home, ensuring a bumper harvest.

At present, the sixty-three production brigades and three hundred and fifty-nine production teams throughout the commune have universally launched a new upsurge of cotton overproduction competition between teams, groups, and individuals, and there has emerged a "three high" situation of high labor attendance, high production efficiency, and high quality of agricultural work. The labor force participating in production throughout the commune has increased from more than 20,000 people to nearly 30,000 people, and more than 11,000 people are participating in fertilizer accumulation at night alone. Each team has classified and ranked all cotton fields, and taken specific measures according to the specific situation.

    有旱抗旱　有虫治虫　突击积肥　朵朵还家
    七里营公社决心增产棉花二百八十万斤
    据新华社郑州9日电　河南新乡七里营人民公社社员认真学习党的八届八中全会公报和决议，大鼓干劲，大增措施，决心在原订产棉计划的基础上，今年再增收棉花二百八十万斤。为了实现这个目的，全公社已有四万二千多社员订立了个人的跃进计划，两万多人向公社党委递交了决心书。
    公社干部和群众充分分析了当前的生产形势，认为今年棉花由于管理措施得当，抓住了各个管理期间的增产关键，因而果枝多，棉桃多，幼桃和花蕾多，生长期间还长，只要加强后期管理，大抓秋桃晚桃，增产潜力仍然很大。各队进一步树立了完成超产任务的信心，普遍修订了自己的计划。全社共种棉花九万三千五百亩，经过修订以后，亩产计划由原来的一百三十斤提高为一百六十斤。他们的具体措施是：有旱抗到底，无雨保丰收，所有棉田普遍再浇一次水；彻底战胜后期虫害，做到有虫就治，坚决不使棉花因虫害而落蕾减产；突击施肥，要求每亩棉田再施化肥十斤；根根棉花在盛开季节突击采摘，作到棵不留朵，路不丢花，朵朵还家，确保丰产丰收。
    目前，全社六十三个生产大队，三百五十九个生产小队，普遍掀起了队与队，组与组，人与人之间的棉花超产竞赛新高潮，出现了劳动出勤率高，生产效率高，农活质量高的“三高”局面。全社参加生产的劳力由两万多人增加到近三万人，光夜晚参加积肥的就有一万一千多人。各队都把所有棉田分类排队，根据具体情况，采取具体措施。
