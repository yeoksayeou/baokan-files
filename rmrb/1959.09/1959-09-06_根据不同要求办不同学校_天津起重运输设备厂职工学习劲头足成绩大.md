    Running Different Schools According to Different Requirements
    Workers at Tianjin Hoisting and Transportation Equipment Factory are Eager to Learn and Achieve Great Results

    (Our report) The Tianjin Hoisting and Transportation Equipment Factory, based on the characteristics of the factory's production, and the different levels of production technology, education, and learning requirements of its employees, has established two types of spare-time schools, one focusing on technical studies and the other on cultural studies. It has adopted flexible and diverse learning methods, greatly stimulating workers' interest in learning and consolidating their learning outcomes.

    The Tianjin Hoisting and Transportation Equipment Factory specializes in the production of hoisting machinery. The main direction of its products is to further develop large-scale precision hoisting machinery on the existing foundation. According to the needs of production development, there is a significant increase in technical personnel and workers. In order to cultivate technical personnel and skilled workers quickly, well, and economically, the factory leadership, in view of the fact that more than 90% of the workers in the factory have reached a primary school education level, has adopted the method of simultaneously running professional schools focusing on technical studies and ordinary schools focusing on cultural studies. In 1958, a higher professional class was established, and a secondary professional class was established in the spring of this year. The ordinary school focusing on cultural studies has also expanded from seven classes in the spare-time cultural school established in 1956 to nineteen classes in higher primary, junior high, and senior high. Currently, more than 1,000 employees are studying in these two types of schools, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of employees who should be enrolled in the factory.

    In order to meet the needs of production development, the factory has selected more than 30 people from the existing veteran technicians and worker-origin cadres to participate in the higher professional class focusing on technical studies. The plan is to organize them to learn and master the technical theory of mechanical manufacturing within four to six years, reaching the level of graduates from general engineering colleges. Apprentices in the factory urgently need to improve their production technology knowledge. Adopting the method of learning and applying simultaneously, combined with production, focusing on teaching technical knowledge such as drafting, and emphasizing the improvement of their technical level, combined with teaching necessary basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, the plan is to train them to reach the level of secondary technical school graduates in four years. For the majority of workers who have just become literate or have a primary school education, the focus is on cultural education, consolidating literacy achievements, and improving their cultural level, preparing them for admission to secondary technical schools.

    In order to meet the learning requirements of factory cadres, the school focusing on cultural studies has also specially opened a senior high school Chinese language class for them, to improve their ability to understand and analyze articles, and to learn to write plans, summaries, and general application documents.

    Since this factory has run these two types of schools, because it meets the different learning requirements of different workers, the enthusiasm for learning is very high, and the attendance rate of students has increased to more than 70%.

    根据不同要求办不同学校
    天津起重运输设备厂职工学习劲头足成绩大
    本报讯　天津起重运输设备厂根据工厂生产的特点，和职工生产技术水平、文化程度、学习要求的不同，举办以学习技术为主和以学习文化为主的两类业余学校，采取灵活多样的学习形式，大大激发了工人们的学习兴趣，巩固了学习成果。
    天津起重运输设备厂是专门生产起重机械的工厂。主要产品的方向是在现有基础上进一步发展大型精密起重机械，根据生产发展的需
  要，技术人员和工人有很大增长。厂领导上为了多快好省地培养技术人员和技术工人，针对这个厂90％以上的工人已达到高小文化程度的情况，采取了以学习技术为主的专业学校和以学习文化为主的普通学校同时并举的方法，在1958年成立了高等专业班，今年春季成立了中等专业班。以学习文化为主的普通学校也由1956年成立的业余文化学校的七个班级而扩充成高小、初中和高中十九个班级。现有一千多名职工分别在这两类学校里学习，占全厂应入学职工总数的70％以上。
    该厂为了适应生产发展的需要，从现有的老技术工人和工人出身的干部中，选拔了三十多人，让他们参加了以学习技术为主的高等专业班学习。计划用四年到六年的时间，组织他们学习和掌握机械制造专业的技术理论，达到一般工科大专学校毕业的水平。工厂的学徒工，迫切需要提高生产技术知识，采取边学边用的方法，结合生产，以讲授制图等技术知识为主，着重提高他们的技术水平，结合进行讲授必要的数理化等文化基础知识，计划用四年的时间培养他们达到中等专科学校毕业生的水平。对于刚脱盲或具有高小文化的多数工人，以文化教育为主，巩固扫盲成果，提高他们的文化水平，为他们升入中等技术学校准备条件。
    为了满足工厂干部学习上的要求，以学习文化为主的学校还特意为他们开设了一个高中语文班，提高他们对文章的理解和分析能力，学会写计划、总结和一般的应用文。
    这个厂举办了这两类学校以后，因为满足了不同工人学习上的不同要求，因而学习的积极性很高，学员的出席率提高到70％以上。
