Taiyuan is located in the central Shanxi basin, a land of coal and iron. The Taihang Mountains and Lüliang Mountains, once famous revolutionary base areas, stand guard on the east and west, facing each other from afar. The Fen River flows through the western suburbs. The twin pagodas of Yongzuo Temple, standing proudly at the foot of the eastern mountain, overlook the entire city. This is a famous historical city. Ancient Taiyuan suffered many wars and was destroyed by fire and water. It was not until the ninth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty (1376) that the current scale of the old city was determined. This ancient city with a long history, in the hands of its last feudal warlord Yan Xishan, actually became an extremely stubborn counter-revolutionary fortress. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the victorious impact of the Battle of Pingxingguan by the Eighth Route Army, the anti-Japanese mass movement in Shanxi surged, and large numbers of revolutionary youths from all over the country rushed to this place. The silent and closed-off Taiyuan, the wavering and compromising Taiyuan, was impacted by the torrent of resistance against Japan and immediately boiled over, becoming a famous city on the anti-Japanese front for a time. Subsequently, Taiyuan was long under the tight encirclement of various revolutionary base areas within Shanxi. At that time, standing on the hills outside Taiyuan and looking at the dim lights in the city, one felt a sense of desolation and indignation. By the eve of liberation, Taiyuan had become even darker and more terrifying. Those who participated in the encirclement of Taiyuan still remember: at that time, the suburbs of Taiyuan were covered with steel and concrete bunkers, pillboxes, gun emplacements, trenches, and barbed wire amidst the yellow wormwood bushes. The city walls were riddled with gun holes and loopholes, and even the famous historical site of the Twin Pagoda Temple was not spared. Bunkers and cannons could not save the fate of the warlord. On April 24, 1949, on the same day as the demise of the Nanjing government, Taiyuan was also liberated. This city, which had endured eight years of bloody Japanese rule and Yan Xishan's last four years of torment, was no longer the Taiyuan of the early days of the War of Resistance. Hunger, filth, decay, bullet marks, and traces of war were everywhere. However, with its liberation, all these desolate scenes were quickly swept away, and a new page of history unfolded before it.

Comrades familiar with the old Taiyuan, upon seeing the new Taiyuan, find many things they remember are gone. A comrade stood in May First Square and asked: "Where is the Xiaonanmen (South Small Gate)?" The policeman smiled and replied: "It's right where you're standing." That comrade looked around: the dusty cart road was gone, the small shops with sieves hanging outside to attract customers were gone, the mass graves were gone, the bunkers and trenches were gone, the dilapidated city gates were gone. All the things in their memory were gone. What was before them was a square, flowers, trees, fountains, new high-rise buildings, bustling crowds, and fast-moving vehicles. This is the transportation hub of the city, and wide asphalt roads extend from here in all directions. Heading west, the green-lined Yingze Avenue leads directly to the magnificent Fen River Bridge. Five-story, seven-story, and nine-story high-rise buildings line both sides of the avenue. Opposite the Yingze Hotel, where there used to be a sewage pond and weed-filled wilderness, now stands a picturesque park. The Hubin Auditorium, which can accommodate five thousand people, is located in this park. The Finance and Trade Building, the Post and Telecommunications Building, the Workers' Cultural Palace, and the Children's Palace are all along this avenue. There are many other wide and beautiful roads like Yingze Avenue, such as Xin Jian Road, Qingnian Road, Bingzhou Road, and Jiefang Road. The current urban area is more than twice the size of the urban area in the early days of liberation. No wonder visitors familiar with the old Taiyuan cannot find their way. Taiyuan has changed too much!

Taiyuan City is uniquely blessed, with inexhaustible coal and iron treasures around it. Our ancestors did not unlock the secrets of this treasure. What Yan Xishan extracted was only a drop in the bucket. The industries he established were few and far between. At the time of liberation, the city had only forty or so dilapidated small factories. Now, after only ten years of construction, there are already more than two hundred and twenty large and medium-sized modern enterprises, and even more small factories, truly a forest of factories. The industrial output value has increased twenty-one times compared to the early days of liberation. The annual growth rate is equal to 3.2 times the average incremental growth rate during the first Five-Year Plan period. As many as two thousand two hundred new products have been successfully trial-produced in a year. What exciting figures these are!

Looking at Taiyuan's industry is truly an eye-opener. There are expanded factories, renovated factories, and even more newly built factories. There is mammoth-sized machinery and equipment, as well as delicate and precise instrument lathes. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in the north is well worth a visit. Standing next to the steelmaking furnace and the rolling mill, watching the flowing molten steel and the dragon-like steel materials is truly awe-inspiring. Last year, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, this factory created the world-renowned three-tap steelmaking. It produces high-grade steel, alloy steel, and can roll all kinds of steel. Many large-scale projects are also under construction. This "steel city" was expanded from a small and old iron and steel factory. It is eight times larger than the original factory, and is still continuing to expand. The Mining Machinery Factory is a renovated factory. Before liberation, it was Yan Xishan's arsenal. Now, this factory is famous domestically for producing complete sets of mining equipment such as drilling rigs, coal cutting machines, and automated coal conveying machines. The Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Factory on the west bank of the Fen River is a newly built factory. This factory began construction in 1950 with the help of the Soviet elder brother. Its appearance can be described as "a thunderclap on flat ground." Before 1950, this was a barren grassy grave slope, with not even a single thatched cottage besides the damaged bunkers. At the mention of building a factory, bulldozers and tractors quickly pushed away the bunkers and leveled the ground. In a few years, a brand new factory was built. Here there are three thousand-ton hydraulic presses, ten-meter gear hobbing machines, and eight-meter gantry planers. These behemoths make people look very small. Standing next to the machines, people look as small as the screws on those giant machines. If you go from here to visit the Taihang Instrument Factory, it is a perfect contrast: there, each and every extremely precise and ingenious lathe is placed on the table, looking like a large toy. Now, the 10,000-kilogram ultra-high voltage tester and C2-350 ultrasonic processing machine manufactured in Taiyuan have been sent to the Leipzig Exhibition. The No. 1 Power Plant is an automated factory where one only needs to push buttons. Its ample power is not only sufficient for the city's use, but also supplies parts of Yuci City and Yangquan City. The No. 2 Power Plant is also under construction. The Xishan Mining Bureau has developed even faster. In just a few years, it has grown from several thousand people to nearly twenty thousand people. The industrial coal it produces supplies many cities across the country.

Taiyuan is a new type of city under construction in full swing. This comprehensive heavy industrial base, with steel, machinery, coal, and chemicals as its mainstays, has already taken initial shape. The current Taiyuan is full of prosperity. The people of Taiyuan, mainly workers, have ambition and drive. They will build more new factories and continuously send products such as steel, machinery, coal, and chemical fertilizers to all parts of the motherland. They are not satisfied with the current asphalt roads and will also run trams on these roads. The Jinci Park in the suburbs is of course a very good place. It not only has quiet woods, beautiful gardens, and clear blue lakes, but also ancient cultural relics. The Tianlong Mountain stone carvings not far from Jinci are also famous throughout the country. They are determined to build the entire Taiyuan into a garden-like city and to introduce the flowing water of the Fen River into the urban area. Under the leadership of the Party, 1.5 million people of Taiyuan are advancing even more bravely, advancing even further.

In his poem "Ode to Taiyuan," Comrade Guo Moruo highly praised the magnificence of Taiyuan's spirit. Taiyuan's spirit is indeed magnificent. The terrain is magnificent, the industry is magnificent, and the people of Taiyuan under the leadership of the Party are even more magnificent. Let me recite Guo Moruo's "Ode to Taiyuan" again to end this short essay:

Looking afar, Taiyuan's spirit is magnificent, Abundant rice fields on both banks of the Fen River,
Emerging industries are advanced, precise, large, and great, Successors are talented, dedicated, and dare to be red. (Attached photo)

专栏：名城赋

    太原气势雄
    束为
    太原处在煤铁之乡的山西中部盆地。曾经是名震全国的革命老根据地的太行山和吕梁山，各据东西，遥遥相对。汾河在西郊流过。傲然耸立于东山脚下的永祚寺双塔，俯瞰全市。这是一座历史名城。古太原几经战乱，曾毁于水火。到明朝洪武九年（1376年）才确定了现在旧城的规模。这座历史悠久的古城，到了它的最后一个封建土皇帝阎锡山手里，竟变成一个极顽固的反革命堡垒了。在抗日战争初期，由于党的领导和八路军平型关大战的胜利影响，山西地区的抗日群众运动汹涌澎湃，全国各地的革命青年，大批大批地奔赴此地。沉默闭塞的太原，动摇妥协的太原，被抗日的洪流所冲击，立即沸腾起来，一时成为抗日前线的名城。嗣后，太原长期处于山西境内各革命根据地严密包围之中。那时，站在太原郊外的山头，遥望城内的幽暗灯火，给人一种凄凉悲愤的感觉。到解放前夕，太原变的更加黑暗和恐怖了。参加过包围太原的人都还记得：当时，太原郊外，遍地黄蒿丛中，到处是钢筋水泥的碉堡，地堡，炮台和战壕、铁丝网。城墙挖的尽是炮洞和枪眼，连著名古迹双塔寺，也不能幸免。碉堡和大炮，不能挽救土皇帝的命运，1949年4月24日，在南京政府灭亡的同一天，太原也解放了。这座经历了八年的日本血腥统治和阎锡山最后四年的折磨的城市，已经不像抗战初期的太原了。饥饿，污秽，衰老，枪痕弹迹，触目皆是。然而，随着它的解放，这一切悲凉景象，很快扫去，在它的眼前，展开了新的历史的一页。
    熟悉旧太原的同志，看了新太原，记忆中的许多东西看不到了。有位同志站在五一广场问：小南门在哪里？警察笑笑答道：就在你站的地方。那位同志举目四望：无风尘土起的大车路没有了，挂个笊篱的留人小店没有了，乱坟堆没有了，碉堡和战壕没有了，破烂城门没有了。记忆中的东西全没有了。眼前是广场，花草，树木，喷泉，新式的高大建筑，熙往攘来的人群和急驰的车辆。这里是市内交通的枢纽，宽阔的沥青马路从这里伸向四面八方。向西走，绿树成荫的迎泽大马路一直通到壮丽的汾河大桥。马路两边排着五层、七层、九层的高楼大厦。迎泽宾馆的对面原是污水潭和野草丛生的荒野，现在变成一座风景如画的公园了。容纳五千人的湖滨大会堂就座落在这个公园内。财贸大楼、邮电大楼、工人文化宫和少年宫，都在这条大马路旁。像迎泽大马路这样宽阔美丽的马路还有新建路、青年路、并州路、解放路等好多条。现在的市区比解放初期的市区扩大了两倍多。难怪熟悉旧太原的来访者寻不见路。太原的变化太大了！
    太原市得天独厚，在它身边有取之不尽用之不竭的煤铁宝藏。我们的古人，没有揭开这个宝藏的秘密。阎锡山所取到的也不及九牛一毛。他办的工业，屈指可数。解放时，全市只有四十多个破破烂烂的小厂子。现在，经过短短十年的建设，已经有了大中型的现代企业二百二十多个，小型工厂那就更多了，真可说是工厂林立。工业产值比解放初期增长了二十一倍。一年增长的速度，等于第一个五年计划期间平均递增速度的三点二倍。一年试制成功的新产品竟达二千二百余种之多。这是多么激动人的数字啊！
    看看太原的工业，是大开眼界的。有扩建的厂子，有改建的厂子，更多的是新建的厂子。有庞然大物似的机械设备，也有小巧玲珑的精密仪表车床。北部的太原钢铁公司很值得一看。站在炼钢炉旁和轧钢机旁，看那奔流的钢水和火龙似的钢材，真是惊心动魄。去年，这个厂子在党的总路线光辉照耀下，创造了举世闻名的三槽出钢。它生产高级钢，合金钢，它可以轧制各种钢材。它正在动工修建的还有许多大型工程。这个“钢城”，是由原来的又小又旧的钢铁厂扩建的。它比原来的厂子扩大了八倍，现在还在继续扩建中。矿山机器厂是个改建的厂子，解放前是阎锡山的兵工厂，现在，这个厂子以生产钻探机、割煤机、自动化运煤机等全套矿山设备闻名于国内。汾河西岸的重型机械制造厂，是个新建的厂子。这个厂子于1950年在苏联老大哥帮助下开始修建。它的出现，可以用“平地一声雷”来形容。1950年以前，这里是荒草野坟坡，除了被打坏的碉堡，连一间草房也没有。说声建厂，推土机，拖拉机很快推掉了碉堡，碾平了地面，几年功夫，一座全新的厂子建设起来了。这里有三千吨的水压机，十米元车，八米龙门刨床。这些庞然大物，把人显得很小，人站在机器旁，小的像那巨型机械上的螺丝钉。要是从这里到太行仪表厂去参观，正好是个对比：在那里，一台一台极其精密灵巧的车床在桌子上摆着，活像大型玩具。现在，太原制造的一万公斤超高压试验器和C2——350型超声波加工机床，已送往来比锡展览。第一发电厂，是一个只按电钮的自动化工厂，它的充足的电力不仅足够本市使用，还供应榆次市和阳泉市一部分。还在修建的尚有第二发电厂。西山矿务局发展得更快。几年中间已经由几千人发展成近二万人，它出产的工业用煤供应着全国许多城市。
    太原，是一座正在热火朝天地建设中的新型城市。这个以钢铁、机械、煤炭和化学为主体的综合的重工业基地，已经初具规模。现在的太原，满城兴旺气象。以工人为主的太原人，有志气，有干劲，他们将要建设更多的新式工厂，源源不断地把钢铁、机械、煤炭、化肥等产品送到祖国各地去。他们不满足现在的沥青大马路，还要在这些马路上奔驰电车。郊外的晋祠公园当然是个很好的地方，它不仅有幽静的树林，美丽的花园，碧波清彻的湖水，还有古老的文化遗迹。离晋祠不远的天龙山石刻，也是全国有名的。他们决心把整个太原建成一座花园似的城市，并且要把汾河的流水引进市区内。一百五十万太原人在党的领导下正在更加奋勇地前进，更前进。
    郭老在“颂太原”一诗中，极赞太原气势的雄伟。太原的气势确实雄伟。地势雄伟，工业雄伟，在党的领导之下的太原人民更其雄伟。让我再念郭老的“颂太原”，以结束这篇短文：
    远望太原气势雄，汾河两岸稻田丰，
    新兴工业高精大，后继英才专敢红。（附图片）
