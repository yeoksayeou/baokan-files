Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 31st: As of the 29th, sixty-four factories, mines, and capital construction units in Taiyuan City had already completed or overfulfilled their August plans ahead of schedule by two to eight days.

At the beginning of August, after studying the People's Daily editorial "Oppose Rightist Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy," the revolutionary drive of workers in various industrial units in Taiyuan City was further boosted, and production flourished. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's First and Third Steel Plants, Jinsheng Textile Factory, Taiyuan Boiler Factory, Wire Rod Factory, Locomotive Factory, Jinxi Machine Factory, and the Hydropower Installation Company, which have already completed their monthly plans ahead of schedule, have all seen significant changes in the work style of their leading cadres. They have all gone deep into the front line of production, leading production in a solid and down-to-earth manner, and working with workers to study and overcome key production challenges. The broad masses of workers have launched emulation drives between workshops, teams, machine tools, construction sites, and individuals, greatly increasing labor productivity. The Xishan Mining Bureau, through emulation drives across the bureau, increased coal production in the first ten days of August by 2.3% compared to the same period last month, by 8% in the middle ten days compared to the first ten days, and again in the last ten days compared to the middle ten days. In August, the Jinxi Machine Factory's workers proposed 172 technical innovation suggestions, which greatly improved production efficiency after implementation, enabling the factory to complete its monthly task four and a half days ahead of schedule.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, all the workers in the city were jubilant and determined to continue to fight a beautiful battle in the crucial month of September, and use the practical action of completing and overfulfilling the third quarter plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 31st: At the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, 1,100 advanced workers have completed two to three years or more of work in the one year and eight months since the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan. These workers include more than ten types of work such as machinists, fitters, foundry workers, forging workers, and riveters. Among them, 1,093 people have completed more than two years of work, and seven people have completed more than three years of work.

These advanced workers, with heroic spirit, have vigorously carried out technical innovations, walking ahead of time. Zhang Jinlong, a fitter who completed forty-one months of work from January 1958 to August 20 this year, has proposed four major rationalization proposals since the beginning of this year, greatly improving production efficiency. The three-head automatic quenching machine he created changed the processing of new freight car No. 3 buffers from manual operation to mechanical operation, increasing efficiency by three times. Liu Laoda, a worker in the forging workshop, proposed changing the round head of the boiler screw support to a flat head, which can save 128 kilograms of steel per locomotive, and can save 7,560 kilograms of steel throughout the year. Yang Fujin, a worker in the freight car workshop who is known as a "skillful tailor," is not only highly efficient in production, but also never wastes an inch of steel. He is responsible for the blanking of new freight car parts, and saved a total of 77 tons of steel from January to July this year.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, these advanced workers worked even harder and set higher goals, determined to create more brilliant achievements to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the suggestion of these advanced workers, foundry workers, forging workers, machinists, riveters, welders, etc. throughout the plant launched emulation drives among themselves in their respective types of work, engaging in a new upsurge of the hot and dynamic movement to increase production and practice economy.

    太原广大职工开展对手赛
    戚墅堰车辆厂一千多人二十个月完成三年左右工作量
    据新华社太原31日电　到29日止，太原市已经有六十四个厂矿和基本建设单位分别提前两天到八天完成和超额完成了8月份的计划。
    8月初，太原市各工业单位职工学习了人民日报“反对右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论以后，革命干劲一鼓再鼓，生产蒸蒸日上。已经提前超额完成月计划的太原钢铁公司第一和第三炼钢厂，晋生纺织厂，太原锅炉厂、线材厂、机车厂，晋西机器厂，以及水电安装公司等单位，领导干部的工作作风都有了显著的转变。他们都深入生产第一线，扎扎实实地领导生产，同工人一道研究攻打生产关键。广大职工群众展开了车间、班组、机床、工地，以及个人与个人之间的对手竞赛，大大提高了劳动生产率。西山矿务局通过全局范围内的对手赛，使8月份上旬煤炭产量比上月同期提高2.3％，中旬比上旬提高8％，下旬比中旬又有提高。晋西机器厂职工8月份提出技术革新建议一百七十二条，实现后都大大提高了生产效率，使全厂提前四天半完成了全月任务。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，全市职工个个欢欣鼓舞，决心在关键性的9月份继续打个漂亮仗，以完成和超额完成第三季度计划的实际行动来迎接国庆十周年。
    新华社南京31日电　戚墅堰机车车辆工厂有一千一百名先进工人，在执行第二个五年计划以来的一年零八个月中，已分别完成了两年到三年以上的工作量。这些工人中，有机床工、钳工、铸工、锻工和铆工等十多个工种。其中，完成两年以上工作量的有一千零九十三人，完成三年以上工作量的有七人。
    这些先进工人以英勇豪迈的气概，大搞技术革新，走在时间前面。从1958年1月到今年8月20日完成四十一个月工作量的钳工张金龙，今年以来提出了四件重大的合理化建议，大大提高了生产效率。他创制的三头自动淬火机，就使加工新货车三号缓冲器由手工操作改变为机械操作，效率提高三倍。锻冶车间工人刘老大提出锅炉螺撑圆头改平头的建议，使每台机车可以节约一百二十八公斤钢材，全年可以节约钢材七千五百六十公斤。被称为“巧裁缝”的货车车间工人杨福金，不但生产效率高，而且从不浪费一寸钢材。他负责新造货车配件下料工作，今年1月至7月共节约了钢材七十七吨。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，这些先进工人个个劲上加劲，订出了更高的奋斗指标，决心创造更光辉的成绩，来响应党中央和毛主席的号召。在这些先进工人的倡议下，全厂铸工、锻工、机床工、铆工、电焊工等都在本工种之间展开了对手竞赛，卷入了热火朝天的增产节约运动新高潮。
