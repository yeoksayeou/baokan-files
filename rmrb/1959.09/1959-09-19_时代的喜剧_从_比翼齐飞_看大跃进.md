    A Comedy of the Era
    ——From "Flying Together" and the Great Leap Forward
    Xu Lei
    The drama "Flying Together," filled with the joyous atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward, has been valued and praised by the literary and art circles and audiences in the capital, and has been selected as a literary and artistic performance program to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This play was created by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Workers' Drama Troupe amidst the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, inspired by rich life experiences. Through the winding story of workers' families participating in production, it vividly demonstrates the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women, under the glorious illumination of the General Line and in the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, as they stride forward to engage in socialist construction, as well as the changes in people's mental outlook and interpersonal relationships.
    The curtain rises on a quiet and elegant courtyard of a workers' dormitory. Two families live side by side here, the male heads of household being excellent workers in the cement plant, enthusiastic about technological innovation.
    During the days of the Great Leap Forward, gongs and drums outside celebrate the General Line. Cao Guizhi, the wife of worker Du Yongfu, is diligent, reasonable, and open-minded. Encouraged by the General Line, she sees that the factory has established many indigenous and foreign-combined vertical kilns for the Great Leap Forward in production and is short of labor. She wholeheartedly wants to participate in production and contribute to socialist construction, but her husband disagrees. Hou Chunshan, another worker, wholeheartedly wants his wife to participate in labor, but his wife, Yu Jinxiang, is a person who relies on her husband for food and clothing and makes all sorts of excuses not to go. The force of social progress brings comedic conflicts and a comedic ending to their family contradictions.
    The play also features various typical characters from the Great Leap Forward, including retired old worker Uncle Lin, who does not want to stand idly by and serves as a technical consultant, and Aunt Lin, who calls herself "economically independent"; rural girl Tang Lan, who hates relying on her husband for a free ride and resolutely participates in work, and her lover, Xiao Xie, an active young worker; elderly commune member Grandpa Yu, full of energy; and Sister Zhang, who has been liberated from the trivialities of arguing and bickering, and enthusiastic family members of the residents' committee. The interweaving of these characters sets off the trend of the leaping life and influences the ideological changes of the main characters in the play.
    As the plot develops, the contradictions reach a climax. Guizhi, ignoring her husband's obstruction, resolutely embarks on the labor front. She once confidently told her husband: I will definitely do a good job in production and arrange the family well. Jinxiang, ignoring her husband's advice, wants to threaten him by returning to her mother's home. The husband ignores her, so she has to leave crestfallen. Du Yongfu hopes that his wife will not be able to endure hardship or will run into obstacles and will be content to stay at home, while Hou Chunshan believes that his wife will change her mind and come back under the education of society.
    The ending is finally comedic: Jinxiang is sent back by her father, this old commune member babbling incessantly to his old friend Uncle Lin about his daughter. Jinxiang, feeling guilty, seeks to talk to Chunshan. Chunshan is happy for her change but deliberately interrupts her and ignores her, allowing her to be whipped by her conscience. Finally, Chunshan and Jinxiang reconcile. After Guizhi participates in the production of vertical kilns, the Party Committee supports her bold suggestion to successfully trial-produce a mud-mixing machine, which greatly reduces women's physical labor. She is praised and named an activist among the new workers. The playful Xiao Xie pretends that the experiment failed and deliberately teases Yongfu. He puts on a crying face and tries his best to conceal the trembling Guizhi, who is laughing, saying: "Sister-in-law, don't be sad, we won't play with this mud-mixing machine anymore, we'll listen to Brother Du." Du Yongfu, hearing this, is discussing matters triumphantly when he suddenly hears that the mud-mixing machine experiment has been successful and that his wife has been named an activist. He is simply ashamed to show his face. Educated by the facts, he finally says to his wife from the bottom of his heart: "I admire you." Guizhi says understandingly: "As long as you can think that besides our relationship as husband and wife, you are a worker, and I am also a worker, and we both have the right to work and the right to vote!"
    Mentioning the creation of "Flying Together," the playwrights and directors of the Workers' Drama Troupe excitedly talk about the moving scenes of last year's Great Leap Forward. They saw a thriving atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward and profound social changes in a cement plant in the suburbs of Beijing. The factory proposed a Great Leap Forward production target of doubling output, and indigenous and foreign-combined vertical kilns were born one after another, and many affiliated factories were also established. In the case of needing a large amount of labor, the families of workers enthusiastically participated in production, and the Party Committee and the trade union personally grasped the welfare of the workers, running canteens and nurseries that everyone was satisfied with. The average increase in the income of workers' families was 23%, and family members broke away from tedious housework and studied culture and watched movies with their husbands, having a common language. They were proud of the title of "female worker." Life has improved, relationships have changed, and new family life is happier and more fulfilling. Some workers said that it was simply like a new marriage.
    Faced with such moving real life and hearing the imperialists slander our Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune destroying families, the playwrights and directors were determined to write the happy changes brought by the Great Leap Forward to family relationships, which they saw with their own eyes, into a comedy to refute the enemy's slander and praise the Great Leap Forward of the motherland.

    时代的喜剧
    ——从“比翼齐飞”看大跃进
    续磊
    洋溢着大跃进喜悦气氛的话剧“比翼齐飞”，受到首都文艺界和观众的重视与赞赏，被选拔为首都庆祝建国十周年文艺演出节目。这出戏是总工会工人话剧团在大跃进的洪流中，受到丰富的生活感受创作出来的。它通过职工家属参加生产的曲折故事，生动地表现了广大妇女在总路线光辉照耀下，在大跃进的热潮中，昂首阔步投入社会主义建设的热情和人们精神面貌、相互关系的变化。
    幕启，是一所清静雅致的职工宿舍庭院。这里并排住着两家人，男主人都是水泥厂热心技术改革的优秀工人。
    大跃进的日子里，外面锣鼓喧天在欢呼总路线。工人杜永福的妻子曹桂枝勤劳达理，思想开朗，在总路线的鼓舞下，看到厂里为了生产大跃进建立了许多土洋结合的立窑，缺乏劳动力，便一心想参加生产为社会主义建设尽一份力量，可是丈夫不同意。工人侯春山一心想让自己的妻子参加劳动，妻子郁金香却是个依靠丈夫、好吃好穿的人，百般借口不肯去。社会前进的力量，使他们的家庭矛盾带来了喜剧的冲突和喜剧的结局。
    剧中还出现了大进跃中的各种典型人物，有不肯袖手旁观担任了技术顾问的退休老工人林大爷和自喻为“金鸡（经济）独立”的林大妈，有厌恶靠丈夫吃闲饭坚决参加工作的农村姑娘唐兰和她的爱人——一位活跃的青年工人小谢；有充满干劲的人民公社老年社员郁大爷，还有从吵架斗嘴繁琐生活中解放出来的张大嫂和热心群众工作的家属委员们。这些人物的穿插，烘托出跃进的生活潮流，影响着剧中主角的思想变化。
    剧情的发展，使矛盾达到了顶点，桂枝不顾丈夫的阻拦，坚决走上了劳动战线，她曾自信地对丈夫说：我一定把生产搞好，把家也安排好。金香不听丈夫的劝告，想用回娘家来威胁，丈夫不理，只好讪讪而去。杜永福希望妻子吃不了苦或碰了钉子会安心呆在家里，侯春山相信妻子在社会的教育下思想转变自己会回来。
    最后是喜剧的结局：金香被父亲送回来了，这位人民公社的老社员叨叨不休地向老友林大爷数落自己的女儿。金香怀着内疚的心情找着和春山讲话，春山为她的转变而高兴，却故意打岔不理她，让她受到内心的鞭笞。最后春山和金香终于和好了。桂枝参加立窑生产后，党委又支持她的大胆建议试制成功和泥机，大大减轻了妇女体力劳动，受到表扬被评为新工人积极分子。顽皮的小谢假装试验失败，故意去逗永福，他装着一副哭腔竭力掩饰着笑得发抖的桂枝说：“嫂子，你就别难过了，咱们以后就不闹这台和泥机了，好好听杜大哥的话。”杜永福听了正在得意地大发议论，突然听说和泥机试验成功了，妻子还被评为积极分子，他简直羞愧得无地自容。在事实的教育下，他终于从心里对妻子说：“我算服了你了”。桂枝会心地说：“只要你能想到咱们俩除了夫妻关系以外，你是个工人，我也是个工人，咱俩都有劳动权、选举权就好啦！”
    提起“比翼齐飞”的创作，工人话剧团的编导兴奋地讲起去年大跃进的动人情景。他们在北京郊区一个水泥厂看到了蓬勃的跃进气氛和深刻的社会变化。工厂提出了生产翻一番的跃进指标，土洋结合的立窑一个个诞生了，许多附属工厂也建立起来了。在需要大批劳动力的情况下，职工家属热情地参加了生产，党委、工会亲自抓职工福利，把食堂托儿所办得人人满意。职工家庭收入平均增长了23％，家属们摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动和丈夫一起学文化、看电影，有了共同语言，她们以“女工”的称号而自豪。生活提高了，关系改变了，新的家庭生活更幸福更美满，有的工人说简直像新婚一样。
    面对着这样动人的现实生活，听到帝国主义污蔑我们的大跃进、人民公社破坏家庭，编导们决心要把亲眼看到的大跃进带来家庭关系的可喜变化写成喜剧，来驳斥敌人的谰言，歌颂祖国的大跃进。
