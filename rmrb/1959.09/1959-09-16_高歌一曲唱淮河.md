Singing a Loud Song of the Huai River

	It's been a long time since I saw the Huai River, a long time since I sang songs of the Huai River. Today, I return to the banks of the Huai River, and sing a loud song of the Huai River! Singing a loud song of the Huai River, the Huai River has changed so much in ten years. Newly built buildings stretch for acres, with red bricks and red tiles reflecting the green waves. Windmills are turning around the river bank, and boundless rice fields are rippling with golden waves. The scenery is as beautiful as a painting everywhere, and fragrant breezes bring songs! In the past, the Huai River often flooded, and the Huai River became an overflowing river, washing away houses and submerging land, with waves surging across thousands of miles of plains. How many people fled the famine, how many families had cold pots, how many families sold their sons and daughters, how many people were buried in the waves! For so many years and generations, who could the Huai River disaster be told to? For so many years and generations, who cared about the life and death of the people? The red flag flutters in front of Tiananmen, and Chairman Mao ordered the Huai River to be harnessed. Great achievements have been made in taming the Huai River for nine years, and thousands of miles sing songs of harvest together. Walking to the river bank to take a look, there are so many boats in the river, each boat is full of abundant grain, and each is like a golden mountain passing on the water. Girls and young men stand at the bow of the boats, singing folk songs waist to mouth, the boys sing a song praising the river network, the girls sing about the transformation of low-lying land into granaries; the boys sing that northern Anhui is better than southern China, the girls sing that the commune is like a flower; the boys sing that paradise exists on earth, the girls sing that the Milky Way has fallen to earth; the singing makes the fish leap out of the water, the singing makes the birds circle the mast, the singing makes the waves dance by the boat, the singing makes the wind pull the sails! Singing a loud song of the Huai River, the Huai River has changed so much in ten years, the glory of the Party is so red and bright, turning the harmful river into a treasure river. The earth has changed greatly in the ten years since the founding of the country, even gods don't have such great abilities, the rivers of the motherland are countless, and each one has become a golden and silver river! Each one has become a golden and silver river, so why do I only sing the Huai River song? First, I’ll moisten my throat with Huai River water, then I’ll sing of all the rivers of the motherland!

    高歌一曲唱淮河
    贺羡泉好久没有见淮河，好久没唱淮河歌，今天重来淮河岸，高歌一曲唱淮河！高歌一曲唱淮河，淮河十年变化多，新盖楼房片连片，红砖红瓦映绿波；河岸风车团团转，无边稻海泛金波，处处景色美如画，阵阵香风阵阵歌！过去淮水常泛滥，淮河成了漫水河，冲倒房屋淹毁地，千里平原逐浪波。多少人儿逃荒走，多少人家凉着锅，多少人家卖儿女，多少人儿埋浪窝！多少年啊多少代，淮河灾难对谁说？多少年啊多少代，谁管人民死与活？天安门前红旗飘，毛主席下令修淮河，治淮九年成绩大，千里同唱丰收歌。走到河边看一看，河里船儿实在多，船船载满丰产粮，座座金山水上过。姑娘小伙船头站，扠腰对口唱山歌，男唱一曲河网赞，女唱洼地变粮窝；男唱淮北赛江南，女唱公社似花朵，男唱天堂人间有，女唱银河地上落；唱得鱼儿跃出水，唱得鸟儿绕桅梢，唱得浪花船边跳，唱得风儿拉篷脚！高歌一曲唱淮河，淮河十年变化多，党的光辉红艳艳，照得害河成宝河。建国十年大地变，神仙没人本领高，祖国河流没有数，条条都成金银河！条条都成金银河，为啥偏唱淮河歌？先用淮水润润嗓，再唱祖国万条河！
