Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 26th: In Hubei Province, more than eight million mu of cotton are bursting with white fluff, and groups of cotton-picking girls are carefully harvesting the new cotton in the fields. Carts from various communes are endlessly heading towards the state markets, fully loaded with cotton.

The cotton harvesting season this year started ten days to half a month earlier than last year, and the masses are very enthusiastic about selling cotton. As of September 20th, the province has already purchased more than 320,000 dan of new cotton, nearly one and a half times more than the same period last year, and the quality of the cotton is also better. The cotton farmers throughout the province have proposed to sell 500,000 dan of cotton before the end of September to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

After the cotton was sown this year, Hubei Province was continuously hit by floods, droughts, and pests. In particular, the severe drought for three months since July posed a great threat to the growing and flowering cotton. However, the people's communes in various places, from the moment the drought occurred, continuously organized thousands of troops to fight the drought, cooperated on a large scale, searched for water sources everywhere, and dug ditches, so that most of the cotton fields were watered several times, ensuring the normal development and growth of the cotton. In the Jianghan Plain, which accounts for more than half of the province's cotton production, all the water in many small ponds, small rivers and ditches was drained in the later stage of drought resistance. The communes also unhesitatingly led the vast number of commune members to draw water from large rivers and lakes to irrigate cotton fields. Now, most of the cotton in the dozen or so cotton-producing counties on this plain is growing well. At present, while vigorously harvesting the early-season cotton, they are also strengthening the later-stage cultivation and management to preserve more of the autumn bolls. Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, more than 400 cotton production teams in Hanchuan County are launching a production increase competition to make the autumn bolls surpass the early-season bolls with soaring enthusiasm. According to a recent general survey of cotton fields in the county, the number of cotton bolls, young bells, and buds are all more than in the same period last year.

However, because this year's drought was fierce and lasted for a long time, some areas had more difficulty in finding water sources. Therefore, some local areas or some cotton fields in the province suffered reduced production or severe production reduction due to drought.

In order to make up for the losses caused by drought reduction in some cotton fields, the people's communes in various places generally carried out education among commune members before harvesting cotton, emphasizing careful harvesting, ensuring every boll is collected, and democratically formulated rules to cherish cotton. They also established specialized teams for harvesting, drying, storing, ginning, and transporting. Zhanggang Commune in Tianmen County organized more than 1,500 cotton picking professional groups, set up red flags and established pacesetters in cotton picking, and launched a competition of "10,000 cotton picking experts, picking 100 jin of seed cotton per day." In Huangmei County, a cotton-producing area in eastern Hubei, under the slogan "Harvest cotton quickly, sell cotton quickly, welcome National Day," more than 3.6 million jin of high-quality lint cotton has been purchased and put into storage by September 17, an increase of nine times compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 26th: Shandong cotton-growing farmers are joyfully and enthusiastically harvesting the bumper cotton crop. Due to the rapid harvesting and selling, as of September 21st, the amount of lint cotton purchased in the province has increased by more than two times compared to the same period last year. This year, the people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Shandong have exerted great power, overcame the extraordinary drought and pests, and made more than 10 million mu of cotton generally grow well. Among them, 5 million mu of large-area high-yield fields are taller than a person's chest and are growing even better. Commune members generally reflect, "This year's cotton has many and large bolls, and the yield is high." Soon after the new cotton began to be picked, good news of bumper harvests continued to spread from various places. The amount of first-picked cotton in Chiping, Pingyuan, Guanxian and other counties reached about 40 jin per mu, all exceeding last year. The harvested cotton is of high quality, good color, and high ginning outturn, generally producing two or three jin more lint cotton per 100 jin of seed cotton than in previous years.

In order to strictly prevent wind and rain from invading and ensure a bumper harvest, various places have generally adopted a method of combining regular picking by professional teams and mobilizing the masses for shock attacks in cotton picking, ensuring timely picking and careful harvesting. In many areas, the manpower of cotton picking professional teams has also been increased in accordance with the increasingly prosperous situation of cotton bolls spitting fluff. Recently, the number of cotton picking commune members in Guanxian and Linqing has increased from 70,000 to more than 140,000, and the daily picking volume in Linqing has increased from 1.8 million jin to more than 3.5 million jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 26th: In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 2.2 million mu of cotton are massively spitting fluff, and everywhere in the cotton-producing areas, silver flowers are blooming on the ground, celebrating the bumper harvest. Hundreds of thousands of Uygur and other ethnic commune members who are busily picking cotton in the fields, inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, launched a cotton picking competition centered on picking more, picking faster, picking cleaner, seizing the time, and ensuring quality. Most of the first-picked cotton in various places has been picked and the new cotton is being marketed in large quantities. As of September 20th, more than 13,700 dan of new cotton has been purchased in 19 cotton-producing counties, an increase of 122% compared to the same period last year.

This year, the cotton harvest area in the autonomous region has increased by nearly 500,000 mu compared to last year. The cotton in various places generally matured earlier than last year, and the amount of pre-frost cotton will greatly increase compared to last year. This is a prominent feature of cotton production this year. Last year, there were only nine counties where new cotton was marketed in large quantities before mid-September, and this year there are nineteen. The fluffing period of 150,000 mu of cotton in the Shihezi Reclamation Area of the Production and Construction Corps was 25 to 30 days earlier than last year. Due to the early maturity, the proportion of pre-frost cotton will increase to 80% this year. The cotton in the Turpan Basin generally matures about ten days earlier than last year.

This year, the people's communes in various places have generally organized specialized cotton teams and vigorously strengthened field management. This is an important reason for the increase in cotton production this year. This year, the seedling protection situation is generally better, generally about 4,000 to 6,000 plants per mu. Due to the adoption of comprehensive technical measures in various places, the implementation of more cultivation, deep cultivation, multiple fertilization, and reasonable fertilization, the situation of cotton bud and bell shedding has generally decreased this year. The situation in the past, which considered that the cotton harvest was set after the dog days, and therefore relaxed later-stage management, has been fundamentally changed this year. This year, the work of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests has been particularly strengthened, so that the late-stage growth of cotton is good and insect pests have been basically eliminated. Since the Party Central Committee proposed to oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and fight hard in August and September, various places have also set off a production upsurge of removing old leaves, pruning empty branches, fertilizing and watering the third-class seedlings, and making another effort, so that the cotton grows even better. Uygur farmers in Makit County generally applied quick-acting fertilizer to the third-class cotton in the first ten days of September. After more than a month of hard work in Shanshan County, the third-class seedlings have been reduced from 24% in the past to about 5% now. In Turpan County, which has a long frost-free period, the people's communes also watered the cotton fields with more flowers in early September to promote the formation of bells and fluffing of these buds, and strive for a greater harvest.

At present, the cotton picking battle in various places in the autonomous region is entering a climax, and farmers of all ethnic groups are constantly dedicating new cotton picking records to National Day.

    喜看银花满地开
    湖北山东新疆精收细摘新棉
    新华社武汉26日电　湖北省八百多万亩棉花吐白絮，成群结队的摘棉姑娘正在田间精细收摘新棉。各地公社的大车队络绎不绝地满载着棉花，涌向国家市场。
    今年棉花的收花期比去年提早十天到半月，群众出售棉花热情很高。到9月20日止，全省已经收购新棉三十二万多担，比去年同期的收购量增加近一倍半，而且棉花质量较好。全省棉农们提出要在9月底以前出售五十万担棉花，向建国十周年献礼。
    今年棉花播种以后，湖北省曾连续遭到涝、旱、虫的袭击；特别是7月份以来三个月的严重干旱，对正在成长和开花结铃的棉花带来极大威胁，但是，各地人民公社从旱情一发生起，就连续不断地组织千军万马大抗旱，大协作，到处找水源，挖沟渠，使广大棉田大都浇了几次水，保证了棉花正常的发育成长。占全省棉花产量半数以上的江汉平原，到抗旱后期，把许多小型塘堰和小河水沟的水全部车干了。各公社又毫不犹豫地率领广大社员，引大江大湖的水灌溉棉田。现在，这片平原上的十几个产棉县，大部分棉花生长情况良好。目前正一边大力收摘伏花，一边加强后期培育管理，多保秋桃。汉川县四百多个棉花生产队，在党的八届八中全会号召鼓舞下，正以冲天干劲展开秋桃超伏桃的增产竞赛。据这个县最近对棉田的普查证明，不论棉花的成桃、幼铃和花蕾，都比去年同期多。
    但是由于今年旱灾来势猛，旱期又长，有些地方水源较为困难，所以全省也有局部地区或部分棉田因旱减产或严重减产。
    为了弥补部分棉田受旱减产的损失，各地人民公社在收摘棉花以前，普遍向社员们进行了精收细摘、朵朵归仓的教育，民主订出人人爱惜棉花的纪律，并且建立了收、晒、藏、轧、运的专业队伍。天门县张港公社组织了一千五百多个收花专业组，在收花中树红旗，立标兵，开展“万个摘棉能手，日摘籽花百斤”的竞赛。鄂东棉区黄梅县在“快收花，快售棉，迎国庆”的口号下，到9月17日已收购入库优质皮棉三百六十多万斤，比去年同期增长九倍。
    新华社济南26日电　山东棉区农民正在欢欣鼓舞地精收细摘丰收的棉花。由于采摘快，出售快，到9月21日止，全省收购的皮棉，比去年同期增加了两倍以上。今年山东产棉地区人民公社发挥巨大威力，战胜了特大干旱和虫害，使一千多万亩棉花普遍生长良好。其中五百万亩大面积丰产田，株高齐胸，长得更好。社员们普遍反映：“今年棉花桃多桃大，产量高。”新棉开始采摘不久，丰收捷报便从各地不断传出。茌平、平原、冠县等县头喷棉花每亩成熟量达四十斤左右，都超过了去年。收下的棉花，质量高，色泽好，衣分率高，一般每百斤籽棉比往年多出皮棉两三斤。
    为了严防风雨侵袭，保证丰产丰收，各地在收棉中，普遍采取了专业队经常采摘与发动群众突击相结合的方法，保证了采摘及时，精收细摘。很多地区，根据棉桃吐絮越来越旺的情况，还增强了拾棉专业队的人力。最近冠县、临清拾花社员已由七万人增加到十四万多人，临清的日摘量已由一百八十万斤提高到三百五十万斤以上。
    新华社乌鲁木齐26日电　新疆维吾尔自治区二百二十万亩棉花大量吐絮，各产棉区到处银花满地，喜庆丰收。正在田间紧张拾花的数十万维吾尔等族社员，在党的八届八中全会的鼓舞下，展开了以多拾、快拾、拾净、抢时间、保质量为中心内容的收花竞赛。各地大部分头喷花已摘拾完毕，新花大量上市。到9月20日止，在十九个产棉县收购的新花已达一万三千七百多担，比去年同期增加了122％。
    今年自治区的棉花收获面积比去年增加近五十万亩。各地棉花普遍比去年提早成熟，霜前花将比去年大大增加，这是今年棉花生产上的突出特点。去年9月中旬以前新棉大量上市的县份只有九个，今年有十九个。生产兵团石河子垦区的十五万亩棉花吐絮期，比去年提早了二十五天到三十天，由于提早成熟，今年霜前花的比例将提高到80％。吐鲁番盆地的棉花一般也比去年提早成熟十天左右。
    各地人民公社今年普遍组织棉花专业队伍，大力加强田间管理，这是今年棉花增产的重要原因。今年棉花保苗情况普遍较好，一般每亩在四千株到六千株左右，由于各地采用了综合技术措施，实行了多中耕，深中耕，多次施肥，合理施肥等办法，因此今年棉花蕾铃脱落的情况普遍减少。过去那种认为伏天过后棉花收成即成定局，因而放松后期管理的情况，今年得到了根本改变。今年特别加强了防治病虫害工作，使棉花后期生长良好，虫害基本消灭。党中央提出反右倾、鼓干劲，大战8、9两月以来，各地又纷纷掀起了打老叶、打空枝，给三类苗施肥、浇水，再加一把劲的生产高潮，使棉花生长更为良好。麦盖提县维吾尔族农民在9月的头十天就给三类棉花普遍追了速效肥。鄯善县经过一个多月的苦战，三类苗由过去的占24％减少到现在的占5％左右。无霜期长的吐鲁番县，各人民公社还给在9月初开花较多的棉田浇水，促使这部分花蕾成铃吐絮，力争更大的丰收。
    目前，自治区各地拾花战斗正进入高潮，各族农民不断以新的拾花纪录向国庆献礼。
