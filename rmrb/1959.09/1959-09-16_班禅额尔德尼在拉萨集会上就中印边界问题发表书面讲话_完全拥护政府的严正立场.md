Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 14th: Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, delivered a written speech at a gathering of people from all ethnic groups and sectors in Lhasa on the Sino-Indian border issue on the 14th, saying, "I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the Sino-Indian border issue on September 8th, and fully support the solemn stance expressed in Premier Zhou's letter."

He said: Historically, both China and India are countries that have long suffered from imperialist aggression. For a long historical period, India was a colony of British imperialism, and only achieved independence within the British Commonwealth in 1947. Under these circumstances, in principle, it should be as Premier Zhou mentioned in his reply to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8th: "Considering the historical background and current actual situation, comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations, in a prepared and step-by-step manner, based on the Five Principles." However, regrettably, the Indian government has put on the face of an expansionist, unilaterally claiming a large area of ​​the People's Republic of China's Tibet region as its territory. Not only that, recently they openly sent troops to cross what they call the McMahon Line to carry out military provocations. This is intolerable! After our People's Liberation Army carried out necessary resistance for self-defense, it then "cried 'stop thief'," attempting to deceive world opinion, attempting to impose its unilateral主張 on the border issue on the great Chinese side. This is because they are blinded by greed and cannot even see the Himalayas.

Panchen Erdeni said: The Indian government repeatedly says that it has no political or territorial ambitions towards Tibet. Then, why did it spare no effort to interfere with the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet, a territory of China, as early as 1950, obstructing representatives of all ethnic groups from the then local government of Tibet from going to Beijing, and then send troops to invade border areas that have never been formally demarcated? This year, it has condoned rioters who fled from Tibet to India to carry out activities against the motherland, and recently sent troops to cross the so-called McMahon Line to carry out military provocations against the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on its own territory. How should all this be explained?

Panchen Erdeni said: "Hindi Chini, Bhai Bhai!" (The Indian and Chinese people are brothers.) This is the call and desire of the true Indian people. During my visit to India in late 1956 and early 1957, I was deeply impressed by the Indian people's friendly wishes for the Chinese people. China and India are the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are friends. Here, I would like to draw the Indian government's attention: The Indian government should not take advantage of our willingness to be friends with you to bully us! Your current practices are not friendly enough. You must know that the great six hundred and fifty million people, including all Tibetan monks and lay people, are not to be trifled with. I would like to remind you again, for the sake of friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, you should be honest.

    班禅额尔德尼在拉萨集会上就中印边界问题发表书面讲话
    完全拥护政府的严正立场
    新华社拉萨14日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼14日在拉萨各族各界人士关于中印边界问题的集会上发表书面讲话说：“我完全拥护周恩来总理9月8日就中印边界问题给印度总理尼赫鲁的信，完全支持周总理信中所表示的严正立场。”
    他说：从历史上讲，中印两国都是长期遭受帝国主义侵略的国家。在一个很长的历史时期内，印度是英帝国主义的殖民地，只是在1947年才取得了在英联邦内的独立。根据这种情况，按道理应该像周总理在9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的复信中所提到的：“考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题”。但是令人遗憾的是印度政府却摆出一副扩张主义者的面孔，片面地把中华人民共和国西藏地方的大片土地说成是它的领土。不仅如此，最近还公然派兵越过他们所说的麦克马洪线，进行军事挑衅。是可忍、孰不可忍？当我国人民解放军为了自卫进行必要的抵抗后，它便“贼喊捉贼”，企图欺骗世界舆论，企图把自己的关于边界问题的片面主张强加于伟大的中国方面，这是利欲迷住了心窍，有眼也看不见喜马拉雅山了。
    班禅额尔德尼说：印度政府口口声声说它对于西藏并无政治或领土的野心，那么，它早在1950年不惜用各种手段干涉人民解放军进军中国的领土西藏，阻挠当时西藏地方当局的各族代表去北京，接着派兵侵入从未正式划定界线的边界地区，今年又纵容从西藏逃入印度的叛乱分子进行反对祖国的活动，最近又派兵越过所谓麦克马洪线，对驻扎在自己领土上的中国人民解放军进行军事挑衅，这一切应如何解释？
    班禅额尔德尼说：“印地秦尼，巴依巴依！”（印中人民是兄弟）这是真正印度人民的呼声和愿望。我在1956年底1957年初访问印度期间，对于印度人民对中国人民的这种友好愿望，有极深刻的印象。中印两国是和平共处的五项原则的创始人。我们是朋友。这里我愿意提起印度政府注意：印度政府不应该利用我们愿意和你们当朋友的心理来欺侮我们！你们现在的做法太不够朋友了。要知道：包括全体西藏僧俗人民在内的伟大的六亿五千万人民是不好惹的。我愿意再次提醒你们，为了中印两国人民之间的友谊，你们还是老实一些好。
