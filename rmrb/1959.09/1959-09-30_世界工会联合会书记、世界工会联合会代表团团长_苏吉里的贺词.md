Comrades,

The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is immensely excited to have been invited to send a delegation to participate in the grand celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Please allow me, on behalf of the 95 million members of the WFTU, to express our heartfelt gratitude.

The entire Chinese working class and people are engaged in socialist construction with astonishing vigor and at rocket-like speed. I would like to extend to you, and through you to them, our warm, profound, and fraternal greetings.

Ten years ago, the cannons of the Chinese people's liberation accelerated the sinking of the decrepit old ship of world imperialism. The liberation of the Chinese people strengthened the camp of peace and also inspired the vigorous development of the struggles of colonies and dependent countries against imperialism and colonialism. The liberation of the Chinese people added a powerful force to the rising tide of the world workers' struggle. This is of extreme importance to colonies and dependent countries, because the workers' movement is a force in the national independence struggles of colonies and dependent countries, and it is sending imperialism and colonialism to their graves more and more rapidly.

The WFTU delegation sees the rapid and enormous changes that have taken place in China as if in a dream, but this is not a dream. In just ten short years, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have transformed an ancient country into a modern one, turning what people once thought impossible into a reality that inspires the broad masses of people.

During its brief visit, the WFTU delegation has personally witnessed the united masses of workers and trade unions, and the vigorously developing mass movement, unleash new creativity in the cause of building socialism.

Therefore, the WFTU is very proud to have People's China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as its members. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, with its 17 million members, is a creator of the leaping forward new China and a staunch defender of the great unity of the working class worldwide.

The current international situation is one in which the forces of the people are growing stronger and stronger, and world imperialism is dying. And China has such conditions: the Chinese people are diligent, brave, and full of vigor, demonstrating great creativity and amazing organizational skills. I believe that all this will create new factors for the prosperous socialist construction of People's China.

Long live the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, marching forward in step in socialist construction!

Long live the great unity of the working class worldwide!

Long live lasting peace!

    世界工会联合会书记、世界工会联合会代表团团长
    苏吉里的贺词同志们：
    世界工会联合会应邀派遣代表团参加庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年的盛典，我们感到无限兴奋，请允许我代表世界工会联合会九千五百万会员表示衷心的感谢。
    中国全体工人和人民正在以惊人的干劲和火箭般的速度进行社会主义建设，我谨向你们并通过你们向他们致以热烈的、深切的、兄弟般的敬礼。
    十年前中国人民解放的炮火加速了世界帝国主义这只老朽的破船的沉没。中国人民的解放加强了和平阵营，同时也鼓舞了殖民地附属国反对帝国主义殖民主义的斗争蓬勃发展。中国人民的解放向日益高涨的世界工人斗争加进了一股强大的力量。这对殖民地附属国具有极为重大的意义，因为工人运动是殖民地附属国民族独立斗争的一股力量，它越来越迅速地把帝国主义和殖民主义送进坟墓。
    世界工会联合会代表团看到中国所发生的迅速而巨大的变化，就像在做梦，但这不是梦。中国工人阶级和中国人民在短短的十年内把一个古老的国家变为现代化的国家，把过去人们认为不可能办到的事情变成鼓舞广大人民的现实。
    在时间很短的访问中，世界工会联合会代表团已经亲身看到了，团结一致的工人群众和工会以及蓬勃开展的群众运动在建设社会主义的事业中发挥了新的创造力。
    因此，世界工会联合会以有了人民中国和中华全国总工会这样的会员而感到十分自豪。中华全国总工会拥有一千七百万会员，它是跃进中的新中国的缔造者和全世界工人阶级大团结的忠实维护者。
    目前的国际形势是人民力量日益壮大，世界帝国主义奄奄一息。而中国又具有这样的条件：中国人民勤劳勇敢，干劲冲天，表现出伟大的创造力和惊人的组织能力。我相信，这一切将给人民中国欣欣向荣的社会主义建设创造新的因素。
    中华人民共和国建国十周年万岁！
    在社会主义建设中齐步前进的中国工人阶级和中国人民万岁！
    全世界工人阶级大团结万岁！
    持久和平万岁！（附图片）
