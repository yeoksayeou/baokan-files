    “Bitterness” and “Skill”
  　Feng Shichang
    Some people say that hard work is always limited, and we should also work skillfully. Yes, skillful work is very important. However, is it because hard work has a limit that we need to add skillful work? I don't think that's the case. Because those comrades who say that hard work has a limit simply understand hard work as physical exertion, but they don't know that hard work includes both physical hard work and, more importantly, intellectual hard work. A person's physical strength may be limited, but their intelligence is infinite. Because the development of the objective world is infinite, and human understanding of the objective world is also infinite. Today we have today's understanding, and tomorrow our knowledge will grow a little more, and our understanding of the objective world will be deeper and broader, and our wisdom will be greater. Therefore, from this point of view, how can hard work have a bottom? Thinking that skillful work is needed because hard work has a limit is essentially separating hard work from skillful work.
    Bitterness and skill, fundamentally speaking, cannot be separated. Without hard work, it is impossible to produce skillful work. Similarly, without skillful work, the effect of hard work is difficult to improve. For example, Comrade Wang Chonglun, the national model worker who was famous throughout the country in those years, created the universal tool holder. Before this tool was created, he went through thousands of times of hard thinking and thousands of times of experimental operation. As a result, skill was born from bitterness, and the universal tool holder was created, which greatly improved labor productivity and made him a person who walked ahead of time. Can we say that Wang Chonglun only worked hard and did not work skillfully, or only worked skillfully and did not work hard? Wang Chonglun is like this, and so are the thousands upon thousands of labor models and activists on socialist labor posts. Some of our comrades often fail to understand these principles, only want to work skillfully and are unwilling to work hard, vainly hoping for skillful work that is divorced from hard work, and always want a "flash of inspiration, a plan comes to mind," attempting to find the knack for skillful work without putting in a little hard work. In the end, it is impossible to have a "flash of inspiration, a plan comes to mind." From bitterness to skill, skill is born from bitterness. This deeply contains the dialectical principle of the development of things from quantitative change to qualitative change. So-called hard work is our continuous process of understanding the inherent laws of objective things, which is the stage of perceptual knowledge; so-called skillful work is our process of mastering and applying objective laws, which is the stage of rational knowledge. From continuously understanding objective laws to correctly mastering and applying them, from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, this is a leap in epistemology, a qualitative change. Constant hard work is the accumulation of quantitative change, and when it accumulates to a certain extent, it will jump from quantitative change to qualitative change, and hard work will be transformed into skillful work. Therefore, there is never skillful work without hard work, just as there is no qualitative change without quantitative change. If you only want to be opportunistic and unwilling to work hard in any work, and do not go through the process of understanding the inherent essence of things, then how can you grasp the inherent regularity of the thing, and with what capital can you find the knack in the work? The so-called "flash of inspiration, a plan comes to mind," this inspiration does not come out of thin air. Only when you are familiar with something to a certain extent will you come up with clever ideas. The saying "practice makes perfect" is the same principle.
    From this it can be seen that our great Party has repeatedly proposed hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and emphasized the importance of hard work. Its meaning is very profound. Skillful work divorced from hard work is like a tree without roots, water without a source, and will not achieve the expected results.

    “苦”与“巧”
  　冯世昌
    有的人说，苦干总是有限度的，我们还应巧干。是的，巧干是非常重要的。可是，是否因为苦干有个限度，所以才要加上巧干呢？我看不是这么一回事。因为，说苦干有个限度的同志，只是单纯地把苦干理解为是体力上的消耗，实不知苦干既包括体力上的苦干，更包括智力上的苦干。一个人体力虽有限，智力却无穷。因为，客观世界发展是无穷的，人对客观世界的认识也是无穷的。今天有今天的认识，到了明天，知识又增长了些，对客观世界的认识也就更深广些，智慧也就更多些。因此，从这个意义来看，苦干怎么会有底呢？认为由于苦干有个限度，所以才要加上巧干，这实质上是把苦干与巧干割裂开来看的。
    苦与巧，从根本上说是不能分开的，没有苦干，就不可能产生出巧干来，同样，没有巧干，苦干的效果也很难提高。譬如说，当年闻名全国的劳模王崇伦同志，他创造了万能工具胎。在这个工具没创造出来之前，他是经过千百次的苦思苦想，千百次的实验操作，结果苦中生巧，把万能工具胎创造出来，从而大大地提高了劳动生产率，成为走在时间的前面的人。能够说王崇伦只是苦干，没有巧干，或者只是巧干，没有苦干吗？王崇伦是如此，其他在社会主义劳动岗位上的成千上万的劳动模范和积极分子通统是如此。我们有些同志，往往理解不到这些道理，只想巧干，不愿苦干，妄想有脱离苦干的巧干，做任何事情一味想“灵机一动，计上心来”企图不下一点苦工夫，就找到巧干的窍门来，终于是不可能“灵机一动，计上心来”的。由苦到巧，苦中生巧，这里面深含了事物由量变到质变发展的辩证道理。所谓苦干，就是我们对客观事物内在规律的不断认识过程，是感性认识阶段；所谓巧干，就是我们对客观规律的掌握运用过程，是理性认识阶段。由对客观规律的不断认识到正确掌握和运用，由感性认识到理性认识，这是认识论上一个飞跃，是一个质变。不断的苦干是量变的积累，而积累到一定程度时，就会由量变跃为质变，苦干就会向巧干方面转化。所以，从来没有不经过苦干的巧干，正像没有不经过量变的质变一样。如果做任何工作，只想取巧，不愿苦干，不经过对事物内在本质的认识，那么怎么能掌握该事物的内在规律性，凭什么本钱在工作中找出窍门来呢？所谓“灵机一动，计上心来”，这个灵机不是凭空而来的，只有对某种事物熟悉到一定程度时才会生出巧计来。俗语说“熟能生巧”就是这个道理。
    由此可见，我们伟大的党一再提出苦干、实干、巧干，并强调苦干的重要性，其含义是非常深刻的。脱离苦干的巧干，犹如无本之木，无源之水，是不会得到预期的结果的。
