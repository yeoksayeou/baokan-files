Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: Phạm Bình, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, was invited by the Central People's Broadcasting Station tonight to deliver a radio address to the Chinese people in celebration of the 14th anniversary of the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

In his radio address, Phạm Bình elaborated on the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in all aspects under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party since the restoration of peace in Vietnam in 1954. He said that from 1955 to 1957, the Vietnamese people had victoriously completed the restoration of a national economy that was already backward and had been damaged by fifteen years of war, and had entered the three-year plan stage of 1958-1960 in order to move towards socialism. This year is the second year of the three-year plan, and also a crucial year, and the Vietnamese people have achieved many remarkable successes. The agricultural cooperativization movement has developed into a mass movement and is being expanded and consolidated day by day. Last winter and this spring, despite severe natural disasters, an unprecedented bumper harvest was obtained, with the average yield of grain in North Vietnam reaching 21 quintals per hectare. The handicraft cooperativization movement and the socialist transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce have also made much progress. The amount of basic construction in 1959 has doubled compared with last year, and the total output value of state-owned industry in the first half of 1959 has increased by 80.9% compared with the same period last year. Along with economic development, much achievement has also been made in cultural and educational work in the first half of this year.

Phạm Bình said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently respected and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people demand that American imperialism get out of South Vietnam, and demand that the South Vietnamese authorities immediately stop their war preparations and their persecution and retaliation against former resistance personnel and all patriots. The Vietnamese people demand that the Geneva Accords be fully implemented in Laos. The Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that their just struggle will be victorious! The cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland will be accomplished, which no force can stop.

Phạm Bình finally said that the Vietnamese people are very happy about the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward and the upsurge of the people's communes. These great achievements of the Chinese people eloquently demonstrate the correctness of the general line for building socialism put forward by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, and also demonstrate the spirit of continuous revolution of the fraternal Chinese people. The great achievements of the Chinese people and the achievements of the fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have made the strength of the socialist camp increasingly strong, thereby making world peace a more reliable guarantee.

    越南临时代办范平发表广播讲话
    越南社会主义建设成就卓著
    据新华社2日讯　越南民主共和国驻华大使馆临时代办范平，今晚应中央人民广播电台邀请向中国人民发表广播讲话，庆祝越南民主共和国独立十四周年。
  范平在广播讲话中阐述了从1954年越南恢复和平以来，越南人民在越南劳动党领导下在各方面所取得的巨大成就。他说，从1955到1957年三年间，越南人民已胜利完成了恢复一个本已落后又遭受十五年战争破坏的国民经济，并且转入了1958—1960年三年计划阶段，以便走向社会主义。今年是三年计划的第二年，也是关键性的一年，越南人民已获得了许多可观的成就。农业合作化运动已发展成为群众性的运动，并且正在日益扩大与巩固，去冬今春，尽管受到严重的天灾，可是仍获得了空前未有的大丰收，北越谷物平均每公顷产量达二十一公担。手工业合作化运动和对私营资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造也有许多进展。1959年基本建设施工量比去年增加一倍，1959年上半年和去年同期比较，国营工业总产值已增长了80.9％。伴随着经济发展的同时，在今年上半年文化教育工作也取得许多成就。
    范平说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府一贯尊重并严正履行日内瓦协议。越南人民要求美帝国主义从南越滚出去，要求南越当局立即停止备战计划以及对前抗战人员和一切爱国者进行迫害和报复的行为。越南人民要求日内瓦协议在老挝得到彻底履行。越南人民深信自己的正义斗争一定会赢得胜利！和平统一祖国的事业一定会完成，这是任何力量所不能阻挡的。
    范平最后说，越南人民对中国人民在大跃进，在人民公社的高潮中所获得的巨大成就感到十分高兴。中国人民的这些伟大成就，雄辩地证明了以毛主席为首的中国共产党所提出的建设社会主义总路线的正确性，同时也显示了兄弟般的中国人民不断革命的精神。中国人民的伟大成就和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各个兄弟国家的成就，使得社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，从而使世界和平也获得愈加可靠的保障。
