    A Short History of the Games
  　Zhang Rongquan
    One of the characteristics of sports is competition. China has a long tradition of sports, so sports competitions have existed since ancient times.
  According to records, in the Zhou dynasty army, there was sprint racing as military training, and archery competitions were also popular. During the Former Han dynasty, the army had throwing and jumping sports competitions. After the patriotic poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by throwing himself into the Miluo River, dragon boat races (dragon boat competitions) flourished in the southern provinces to commemorate him. Ball games were very popular in the Tang Dynasty court. In the third year of Jinglong (709 AD) during the reign of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, the Tibetan envoy Shang Zan Doban La and others were sent to Chang'an to welcome Princess Jincheng in marriage, and a friendly horse polo match was held between the Han and Tibetans. Initially, the Tibetans were tall and good at riding, winning consecutive victories. Later, Zhongzong ordered Prince Linzi, Li Longji (later Emperor Xuanzong of Tang), Prince Si of Guo, Yong, and the驸马 (imperial son-in-law) Yang Shenjiao and Xiuwu to play. Li Longji had been skilled in polo since childhood, and the two imperial sons-in-law were also good at riding and shooting. They and Prince Si of Guo, Yong, were considered the "sports champions" of the time. The situation immediately changed after these four entered the game, overwhelming the Tibetan athletes. As a result they reversed the defeat. Zhongzong was overjoyed and rewarded the Tibetan envoy with hundreds of bolts of silk. Wrestling was called "Jiaodi" in ancient times. In the Zhou dynasty army, "Jiaoli" was used as an important military sport. Since then, there have been written records of wrestling competitions in various dynasties. With a large mass participation, chapter seventy-four of Water Margin vividly describes the mass scenes of wrestling competitions and the referee rules in the early Qing Dynasty when Yan Qing fought in the ring.
    In the late Qing Dynasty, with the invasion of imperialist warships and culture, internationally popular sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, and track and field gradually flowed into our country. They first started in missionary schools in some large cities. In the second year of Xuantong, a so-called national sports meeting was held in Nanjing, hosted by foreign missionaries. In fact, only schools from a few cities sent representatives to participate. The current Professor Ma John was the champion of the 880-yard race at this sports meeting. Later, two more sessions were held successively. It was not until the Fourth National Games that it was hosted by the reactionary government of the Kuomintang, which shows that the sports movement in our country at that time was also deeply marked with semi-colonial and semi-feudal characteristics. The so-called "National Games" at that time had crude equipment and a small number of participants, only one or two hundred, at most one or two thousand. Behind the grand curtain of the Games, there were all kinds of dirty tricks. The so-called "Seventh National Games," which made its appearance on the eve of the collapse of the Jiang Dynasty, was even more ugly and unworthy of attention.
    At the same time, among the vast army and people in the liberated areas, a sports movement truly serving to strengthen the body and protect the country was growing vigorously. In 1934, in his report to the Second National Soviet Congress, Chairman Mao mentioned that "the mass red sports movement is also developing rapidly, and track and field competitions are now held even in remote villages, and sports fields have been equipped in many places." During the Anti-Japanese War, Yan'an not only had sports organizations, but Yan'an University also had a sports department. The six-day "September 1st Enlarged Sports Meeting" held in 1942 was a sensation in the liberated areas. This sports meeting included track and field, ball games, swimming, gymnastics, and military sports; more than 1,000 athletes participated, and the sports meeting fully reflected the determination of the army and people in the liberated areas to win in the arduous struggle. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out in an article written for the then Party Central Committee's newspaper—Liberation Daily—that "A strong army and a robust population are good for fighting battles and handling affairs," "Cultivate a sound and strong physique, and train ourselves to be a strong and solid generation to undertake the arduous task of resisting Japan and building the country." Comrades Zhu De and He Long served as the president and vice president of the sports meeting. This fully reflects the Party's attention and concern for sports.
    The old sports ended with the complete collapse of the reactionary regime; the new people's sports flourished with the victory of the revolutionary cause. The unprecedented First National Games of the People's Republic of China was a milestone in the great development of the people's sports cause.

    运动会史话
  　张荣泉
    体育运动的特点之一就是要竞赛。中国有悠久的体育传统，因而运动竞赛也是古来就有。
  据记载，在周代的军队中就有赛跑竞赛的军事训练，射箭比赛也较为盛行。前汉时代的军队中有投掷和跳跃的运动竞赛。爱国诗人屈原投汨罗江自杀后，民间为了纪念他，端阳龙舟竞渡（赛龙船）在南方各省蔚然成风。球类运动在唐朝宫廷中很流行，唐中宗景龙三年（七○九年），吐蕃（西藏）派遣使者尚赞咄番腊等到长安迎娶金城公主，还举行过一场汉藏之间马球友谊赛。开始时西藏人高大善骑，连战皆捷，后中宗命临淄王李隆基（即后来的唐明皇）、嗣虢王邕以及驸马杨慎交、秀武等四人下场。李隆基自小精习球艺，两位驸马也善骑射，与嗣虢王邕都堪称是当时的“运动健将”。这四人下场后形势立刻改观，使吐蕃运动员应接不暇，结果挽回了败局。中宗大悦，特赏赐吐蕃使者数百段绢。摔跤运动古时称为“角抵”，周代的军队中以“角力”作为重要的军事体育，以后历代都有摔跤比赛的文字记载，?具群众规模，水浒传七十四回燕青打擂台那一章绘声绘色地描写了清初摔跤比赛的群众场面，和裁判规则。
    清朝末年，随着帝国主义的军舰和文化的侵入，国际流行的体育项目诸如足球、篮球、排球、田径等也渐次流入我国。首先在一些大城市的教会学校里展开。宣统二年，由教会洋人主持在南京开了一次号称全国性的运动会，实际只有几个城市的学校派代表参加，现在的马约翰老教授就是这次运动会上八百八十码赛跑冠军。以后还陆续开了两届。直到第四届全国运动会才由国民党反动政府主办，可见当时我国的体育运动也深深地刻记着半殖民地半封建的烙印。那时的所谓“全运会”，设备窳陋，人数少只一二百人，至多一二千人，在运动会的堂皇帷幕后面，隐藏着种种肮脏勾当，蒋王朝崩溃前夕粉墨登场的所谓“第七届全国运动会”，更是丑态百出，不屑一顾。
    与此同时，在解放区的广大军民中，一种真正为强身保国服务的体育运动正在茁壮。1934年，毛主席在对第二次全国苏维埃代表大会的报告中提到“群众的红色体育运动，也是迅速发展的，现虽偏僻乡村中也有了田径赛，而运动场则在许多地方都设备了。”抗日战争时期的延安，不仅有体育会的组织，延安大学还设有体育系。1942年举行的历时六天的“九一扩大运动会”曾是轰动解放区的一件盛事。这次运动会上有田径、球类、游泳、体操和军事体育等项目；一千多名运动员参加，运动会充分反映了解放区军民在艰苦斗争中的必胜信心。朱德总司令给当时党中央机关报——解放日报——所写的文章中指出：“军强民壮，才好打仗办事”“培养健全强盛的体魄，把自己锻炼成坚强结实的一代，来担负抗战建国的艰巨事业。”朱德同志和贺龙同志担任运动会正副会长。这充分体现了党对体育事业的重视和关怀。
    旧体育随着反动政权的彻底垮台而告终；新的人民的体育则随着革命事业的胜利而欣欣向荣。规模空前的中华人民共和国第一届运动会，就是人民体育事业巨大发展的里程碑。
