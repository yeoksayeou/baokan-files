Spending the Mid-Autumn Festival on the Moon
Zhou Fen

	Throughout the year, the moon waxes and wanes twelve times, but the Mid-Autumn Festival's bright moon is the most eye-catching. From a scientific point of view, there are two reasons for this: First, the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar always falls around the autumnal equinox; for example, this year it is seven days before the autumnal equinox. During the autumnal equinox, in the Northern Hemisphere, the moon's orbit is closest to the horizon, and the moon's declination increases every day, so the moon rises relatively early. The middle of the eighth lunar month is when farmers are busy harvesting, and the days are getting shorter while the nights are getting longer. In this situation, the moon rises early at dusk, allowing farmers to work in the fields for a few more tens of minutes. Therefore, foreigners call the Mid-Autumn moon the harvest moon. Our country has always been based on agriculture, and the twenty-four solar terms are for serving agriculture. Paying attention to and utilizing the Mid-Autumn moon is only natural. Second, August is after the rainy season, the autumn air is crisp and refreshing, and there is particularly little dust in the sky, reducing the absorption of light by dust, so "the moon is especially bright during Mid-Autumn Festival." In fact, from an astronomical point of view, the moon is not only "especially bright" during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and it is not necessarily "especially bright" every Mid-Autumn Festival. If the air is equally transparent, and the moon happens to be at its perigee when it is full, then the moon on the fifteenth or sixteenth day of the eleventh lunar month will be the brightest, but at that time it is already freezing cold, and the north wind is howling, making it inconvenient for people to enjoy it in the yard and by the lake.

	Soviet astronomers' research shows that the lunar surface is not the silent and static world that people imagined in the past, but is constantly changing and developing. When compiling lunar maps, they discovered that a crater with a diameter of 30 kilometers had disappeared, new craters had appeared elsewhere, and a newly formed deep trench had also been discovered. To understand the details of the lunar surface, it is best to take a space rocket and investigate it.

	Going to the moon is not only beneficial to astronomy but also of great help to other sciences. Here is an example directly related to the human body: Here brings new medical research. Our lifespan is indeed shortened a lot due to the struggle between the heart and gravity. Possibly, on the moon, because gravity is only one-sixth of that on Earth, people with weak hearts become normal, and normal people can live longer. In this way, turning the moon into an aerial park for people all over the world and opening some sanatoriums on it would be quite good.

	This is not a fantasy. The successful launch of the second Soviet space rocket has shown us that going to the moon is entirely possible. In the near future, when we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival again, we can also fly to the moon to play, instead of just looking at it without being able to reach it, as we do now.

    到月球上去过中秋节
    周芬
    一年里面，月亮共有十二次圆缺，最能引人注目的，要算那中秋的明月。从科学的观点看，这原因有两点：第一，旧历八月十五日总是在秋分前后，例如今年在秋分前七天。秋分时节，在北半球来说，月亮的轨道离地平最近，而且月亮的赤纬天天在增加，所以月出的时间便比较早一点。旧历八月中旬正是农民忙于收获的时候，而天时却昼渐短夜渐长。在这个情况下，正好黄昏时分月亮早出，便于农民在田间可以多做几十分钟工作，所以外国人称中秋月为收获月。我国向来以农立国，二十四节气就是为农业服务的，注意和利用中秋的月亮自然不在话下。第二，八月间正是雨季过后，秋高气爽，天空里的灰尘特别少，减小了尘埃对于光的吸收作用，所以“月到中秋分外明”。其实，若单从天文学的观点看，月亮并不是只在八月中秋才“分外明”，而且也不见得每一个八月中秋都“分外明”。如果空气一样透明，而且每逢月圆的时候月亮又恰巧走在近地点，那末阴历十一月十五或十六的月亮才是最明亮，不过那时已经天寒地冻，北风凛烈，人们已经不便于在院子里和江边湖畔欣赏罢了。
    苏联天文学家们的研究表明，月面并不像过去人们所想像的那样，是一个沉寂静止的世界，而是在不断变化发展的。他们在编制月面地图时发现，过去的一个直径达三十公里的环形山不见了，在别的地方又有新的环形山出现，并且还发现了一个新形成的深沟。要弄清楚月面上的详情细节，当然是坐宇宙火箭到上面去考察一番最好。
    到月球上去，不仅对天文学有益，就是对其他科学也大有帮助，顺便举一个与人体直接有关的例子：这里带来了新的医学研究，我们的寿命由于心脏和重力的斗争，的确缩短了不少。可能，在月球上因为重力只有地球上的六分之一，心脏衰弱的人变得正常，正常的人更能延年益寿。这样，把月球变成全世界人民的空中公园，在上面开些疗养院倒是满好的。
    这不是空想。苏联发射第二个宇宙火箭成功的事实，已经向我们指出到月球上去是完全可能的。在不久的将来，再过中秋节的时候，我们也可以飞到月亮上去玩玩，不必像现在这样可望而不可即了。
