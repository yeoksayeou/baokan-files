Who Will Win the 10,000 Meter Championship?

The All-China Games men's 10,000-meter final will be held this afternoon. This eye-catching event brings together sixty-four top athletes. Who will win this championship?

First, there is Su Wenren from the Yunnan team, who is twenty-three years old. He is the national record holder for the 10,000 meters and 5,000 meters in 1958. Last year's 10,000-meter record was 31 minutes 22.4 seconds, not yet breaking the 31-minute mark. After a winter of hard training, he set a new national record of 30 minutes 6.8 seconds in May this year, improving his own national record by 1 minute 15.6 seconds.

Huo Tianshun from the Henan team and Zhao Baorong from the Hebei team have made rapid progress. In July this year, Huo Tianshun and Zhao Baorong achieved good results of 30 minutes 57.4 seconds and 30 minutes 57.8 seconds respectively. They, along with Su Wenren, are currently the only three people in the country who can run 10,000 meters in less than 31 minutes. Huo Tianshun has a large stride and good endurance, while Zhao Baorong is energetic. They are both in good competitive condition now.

Huang Zhiyong of the People's Liberation Army team consecutively defeated veteran long-distance runners Wan Lübai, Fu Shenghai, etc., at the National Summer Games in June last year, winning the 10,000-meter and 5,000-meter championships, with a 10,000-meter result of 31 minutes 36.4 seconds. At the All-Army Games in May this year, he shortened his time by 23.8 seconds.

Is it certain that the championship will be won by one of these few people? Not necessarily. Veteran long-distance runners like Fu Shenghai from the Jilin team, Zheng Zhaoxin and Zhang Yuncheng from the Inner Mongolia team, who were the champions and runners-up in last year's national marathon competition, and newcomer Guo Jinfeng from the Liaoning team will all be fierce contenders for the championship. Moreover, among the athletes from various regions participating in this competition, there is no shortage of rising stars. Therefore, whether you are an experienced veteran or a newcomer to the field, if you want to take the lead, you must muster all your energy and go all out.

### 谁将夺得万米冠军？

    谁将夺得万米冠军？
    全运会男子一万米决赛今天下午举行。这个引人注目的项目，集中了六十四名好手。究竟谁将夺得这项冠军？
    首先是二十三岁的云南队苏文仁。他是1958年一万米和五千米全国纪录保持者。去年的一万米纪录是三十一分二十二秒四，还没有破三十一分大关。经过一冬苦练，今年5月创造了三十分六秒八的全国最新成绩，把他自己保持的全国纪录提高了一分十五秒六。
    河南队霍天顺和河北队赵宝荣进步很快，今年7月间，霍天顺和赵宝荣分别达到了三十分五十七秒四和三十分五十七秒八的好成绩。他俩和苏文仁，是目前国内仅有的三个能在不到三十一分的时间内跑完一万米的人。霍天顺的步幅大，耐力好，赵宝荣劲头冲，他们现在竞技状态都很好。
    解放军队的黄志勇在去年6月的全国夏季运动会上，就接连战胜了长跑老将万吕柏、傅生海等，获得了一万米和五千米冠军，万米成绩是三十一分三十六秒四，在今年5月全军运动会上他又把成绩缩短了二十三秒八。
    是否冠军就一定会被这几个人中的一个夺去呢？不一定。像长跑宿将吉林队的傅生海、去年全国马拉松比赛冠亚军、内蒙古队的郑昭信、张云程和新手辽宁队的郭金凤等都将是冠军的激烈争夺者。而参加这项比赛的各地运动员中，更不乏后起之秀。因此，无论是富有经验的老手，还是初上沙场的新人，要想领先，必须鼓足干劲，全力以赴。
