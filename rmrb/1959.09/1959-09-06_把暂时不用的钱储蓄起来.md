The resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy points out: "We must vigorously promote savings among urban and rural residents so that individuals' temporarily unused cash can be rationally and effectively utilized in construction, which is beneficial to both the country and the family." The people of the whole country are responding to the call of the Party with practical actions of actively saving. In personal and family life, we should be careful and meticulous, and save every yuan of cash that can be saved in the bank to support national construction.

The in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy has created favorable conditions for further developing savings work, and the traditional virtues of thrift and frugality of the Chinese people will be further promoted. Under this favorable situation, the banking sector should vigorously carry out savings business and greatly advance the people's savings cause.

In order to carry out savings business, it is necessary to make everyone clearly understand the significance of savings. Saving is a good thing that is beneficial to the country and the people. For the country, it can obtain a sum of funds that can be used centrally through savings. For example, in the Great Leap Forward of all work across the country in 1958, urban savings increased to 4 billion yuan. How much can be done with these 4 billion yuan for production and construction? If used to build steel plants, it can build about ten steel plants with an annual output of one million tons; if used to build textile factories, it can build more than 480 textile factories with 50,000 spindles and 1,008 looms; if used to build railways, it can build more than 7,500 kilometers; if used to buy tractors, it can buy 195,000 units. Of course, the savings still belong to individuals, but the country can use them centrally for a period of time, so it can do some big things and greatly facilitate socialist construction.

For individuals, actively saving will make national production and construction faster, and everyone will benefit. Individuals develop the habit of saving, can live a planned life, and can plan to add personal necessities, without being loose and tight for a while. The example of the No. 201 Clothing Factory in Wuhan is the best illustration. In the past, many workers in this factory did not pay attention to saving, spent money randomly, and the phenomenon of workers borrowing money and applying for trade union relief was quite common in 1956. Some workers' income and family burdens were about the same, some lived well, and some had more difficulties. Since 1956, due to the continuous education of diligence and frugality to the masses by the factory's party and government leaders, the number of people participating in savings has been increasing. By the second half of 1958, the average savings deposit of all employees in the factory reached 53 yuan, and recently it has increased to 60 yuan. There is no more reliance on borrowing to make a living. Everyone is in a good mood, and production enthusiasm is high. Other units have similar situations. Among urban street residents, many housewives carefully calculate and save the small savings in daily life. Over time, small savings accumulate, and in a certain period, they are used to add some supplies for adults and children. It can be seen that whether there is a concept of saving and whether there is action of saving plays an important role in the good or bad arrangement of personal and family life. Therefore, the party organizations of various enterprises, institutions, streets, and people's communes should regard helping the masses rationally arrange their lives and helping banks carry out savings work as an important part of caring for the lives of the masses. When the masses arrange their lives well and have reserves, they will not worry about personal life problems in production and work, and can concentrate on production and work. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of market conditions, some people think that it is not unreasonable to want to buy more things to improve their lives. The construction of our country is developing year by year, and the people's purchasing power is growing year by year, which is gratifying. However, we must also see that: we must change the face of being economically backward in the shortest possible time and build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Every cause must be diligent and thrifty, and everyone should carry forward the fine tradition of diligence and frugality, save every yuan of temporarily unused money, and support national construction, which can speed up the pace of construction.

Some people also think: they save their money anyway, and they don't spend it randomly, so why deposit it in the bank! This is also considered "saving." This is a view that does not understand the meaning of saving. Promoting savings is to absorb a part of social idle funds through bank deposits by the state for construction. In particular, fixed deposits, the state can use this fund for a longer period of time, which is more conducive to production and construction. When cash is scattered in everyone's hands, the state cannot use it centrally, and therefore cannot play any role in promoting the development of national construction. In fact, this kind of personal "saving" often easily spends the money.

Depositing temporarily unused cash in the bank to support national construction is a good thing and a conscious action of the masses. Therefore, saving must fully respect the wishes of the masses, while strengthening the publicity and organization of saving, and mobilizing more people to participate in saving.

To promote savings, the bank must provide the masses with convenient conditions, save the masses' time as much as possible, and simplify the procedures for deposit and withdrawal. In rural areas, carrying out deposit and withdrawal business in the fields, in cities, setting up savings offices and agency offices, and developing co-savings members and agents in collective units and street neighborhoods are all effective ways to facilitate the masses. These practices should continue to be implemented; places and units that have not yet carried out these businesses should actively create conditions and strive to promote them in a short period of time. Striving to carry out savings business is an important task for bank staff in the movement to increase production and practice economy. Making outstanding achievements in this work is a contribution to increasing production and practicing economy and to completing this year's leap forward plan.

At present, a new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy is being launched in urban and rural areas across the country. While working hard to increase production, let us arrange our personal and family lives well, pay attention to saving bit by bit, and actively participate in savings to support national construction and to complete and over fulfill this year's leap forward plan!

### 把暂时不用的钱储蓄起来

    把暂时不用的钱储蓄起来
    党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议中指出：“在城乡居民中都要大力提倡储蓄，使个人暂时可以不用的现金，在建设事业中得到合理的、有效的利用，既有利于国，又有利于家。”全国人民正在以踊跃储蓄的实际行动来响应党的号召。在个人和家庭生活中精打细算，把每一元能够节约的现金都储蓄到银行中去，支援国家建设。
    增产节约运动的深入开展，为进一步发展储蓄工作创造了有利条件，我国人民传统的节约俭朴的美德也将得到进一步的发扬。银行部门在这种有利的形势下，应当大力开展储蓄业务，把人民储蓄事业向前大大推进一步。
    为了开展储蓄业务，需要使所有的人都清楚地了解储蓄的意义。储蓄是一件于国于民都是有利的好事。对于国家来说，可以通过储蓄得到一笔可以集中使用的资金。如在1958年全国各项工作大跃进中，城镇储蓄额增加到四十亿元。这四十亿元用于生产建设能办多少事呢？如果用来办钢铁厂，可以建设年产一百万吨的钢铁厂十个左右；如果用来办纺织厂，可以建设五万纱锭一千零八台织机的纺织厂四百八十多个；如果用来修铁路，可以修筑七千五百多公里；如果用来买拖拉机，可以买十九万五千台。当然，储蓄的钱还是属于个人的，但是国家可以在一个时期集中使用，因而可以办一些大事，大大有利于促进社会主义建设。
    对个人来说，踊跃储蓄，国家生产建设得更快，人人都有好处。个人养成了储蓄习惯，可以有计划地过日子，有计划地添置个人所需的东西，不致弄得一阵松一阵紧。武汉市二零一被服厂的例子，是一个最好的说明。这个厂的不少工人，过去由于不注意节约也不储蓄，随手乱花钱，1956年工人中借债、申请工会救济的现象相当普遍。有些工人的收入和家庭负担不相上下，有的日子过得挺好，有的就比较困难。1956年以来，由于工厂党政领导不断向群众进行勤俭节约的教育，参加储蓄的人数不断增加，到1958年下半年，全厂职工平均每人储蓄存款达到五十三元，最近更增加到六十元。靠借债度日的再也没有了。人人心情舒畅，生产情绪高涨。另外一些单位也有类似的情况。在城市街道居民中，许多家庭主妇精打细算，把日常生活中的零星节余都储蓄起来，日积月累，积少成多，在一定的时期用来给大人孩子添置点用品。由此可见，有没有节约和储蓄的观念，有没有节约和储蓄的行动，在个人和家庭生活安排的好坏上，起着重要的作用。因此，各个企业、机关、街道、人民公社的党组织都应该把帮助群众合理安排生活、帮助银行开展储蓄工作，当作关心群众生活的一个重要内容。群众把生活安排得好了，留有后备，就会在生产和工作中不为个人生活问题操心，而能集中精力从事生产和工作。工农业生产大跃进了，市场情况好转了，想多买些东西改善生活，有些人觉得，这种想法本来未可厚非。我们国家的建设事业一年比一年发展，人民的购买力一年比一年增长，这是可喜的。但是，我们还必须看到：我们要在最短时间内改变至今仍是经济比较落后的面貌，把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国，每一项事业都必须克勤克俭，人人都应当发扬勤俭节约的优良传统，把每一元暂时不用的钱储蓄起来，支援国家建设，这就可以加快建设的速度。
    也有人认为：自己把钱存起来，反正不乱花，何必存到银行里！把这也算做“储蓄”。这是没有了解储蓄意义的一种看法。提倡储蓄，是由国家通过银行存款的形式，吸收一部分社会游资，用于建设事业。特别是定期存款，国家可以较长期地使用这笔资金，更有利于生产建设。现金分散在每个人的手里，国家就无从集中使用，因而也就不能对促进国家建设事业的发展发挥什么作用。而事实上，这种个人“储蓄”，往往容易随手把钱花光。
    把暂时不用的现金存入银行支援国家建设，这是一件好事情，是群众的自觉的行动。因此，储蓄必须充分尊重群众的自愿，同时加强储蓄的宣传和组织工作，动员更多的人参加储蓄。
    提倡储蓄，就银行来说，必须给群众以便利条件，尽量节省群众的时间，简化存取的手续。在农村，深入田间办理存取业务，在城市，广设储蓄所、代办所，在集体单位和街道里弄，发展协储员、代办员，等等，都是行之有效的便利群众的作法。这些作法应当继续坚持实行；至今还没有开展这些业务的地方和单位，应当积极创造条件，争取在短期内推广实行。努力开展储蓄业务，这是银行工作人员在增产节约运动中的重要任务。在这项工作中做出优异的成绩，就是为增产节约、为完成今年的跃进计划作出了贡献。
    目前全国的城市和农村正在掀起一个增产节约运动的新高潮。让我们在努力增加生产的同时，安排好个人的和家庭的生活，注意点滴节约，踊跃参加储蓄，为支援国家建设，为完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划而努力！
