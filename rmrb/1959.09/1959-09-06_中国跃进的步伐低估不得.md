Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch from Tokyo: While smearing China, Japanese bourgeois public opinion cannot deny the unprecedented achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward.

    The "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" published an editorial on August 29th entitled "Properly Evaluate the Economy of Communist China," stating: "It would probably be an overstatement to assume that the economic construction of Communist China is not going well just because Communist China has revised the statistical figures of last year's Great Leap Forward. Even based on the revised actual results of last year, they are still considerable."

    The newspaper stated: "Communist China, with its abundant resources and 650 million people, still possesses immeasurable potential power and dynamism." "The enthusiastic economic construction being carried out there is something that the free world must not underestimate." It believes that "Overestimation is very dangerous, but at the same time, underestimation and disregard are also inappropriate." However, fearing the impact of China's construction achievements, it went on to say: "It would be a great mistake to be immediately influenced by foreign things, especially those of Communist countries, in everything."

    The "Hokkaido Shimbun" published an editorial on the same day stating that the CCP Eighth Plenary Session revised production targets to achieve "one step back, two steps forward" based on practical plans.

    The newspaper said: Although last year's production achievements were overestimated, compared with the average annual agricultural growth of 5% and industrial growth of 19.2% during the First Five-Year Plan period, the pace of its leap forward should not be underestimated. The revised plan for this year is even higher than last year. We are afraid that we cannot but acknowledge these facts and the decisiveness of the Chinese leaders in taking resolute measures to adapt to reality.

    The "Tokyo Shimbun" published an editorial on the 28th, which had to admit that last year was a year of the Great Leap Forward, and "China's national production achieved a leap-forward development." "The people's communes are very advanced in terms of system," but it attacked China's Great Leap Forward and people's communes, falsely claiming that "the productivity of the people's communes is very low" and "because there is a gap between the system and productivity, various contradictions have arisen." It also fabricated rumors that "Communist China has fundamentally revised its thinking on the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes." It also revealed its wishful thinking in this editorial, falsely claiming that China's "strides of progress cannot last forever," and "if production is forced to increase," it will "move in the opposite direction to socialism."

    The Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) organized a discussion on August 30th to slander the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP. In this discussion, Fumio Kusano, a professor at Takushoku University, defamed China's Great Leap Forward as "dragging the people forward" and a "dictatorial system." He described the Great Leap Forward, in which all Chinese people were in high spirits to rapidly build socialism, as "painful." Kusano also spread rumors and incited discord, saying that China's economic contradictions have caused "resistance" among the people.

    日本资产阶级舆论不能不承认事实
    中国跃进的步伐低估不得
    “就以改正过的去年的实际成绩来说，也是相当大的”。“它那种热火朝天地进行经济建设的情况，是自由世界决不可轻视的”。“修正了的本年度计划比去年还要高。我们恐怕不能不承认这些事实以及中国领导人适应现实而采取断然措施的果断”。“中国的国民生产获得了飞跃的发展”。……
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本资产阶级舆论在对中国进行诬蔑的同时，也无法否认中国人民在大跃进中取得的史无前例的成就。
    “日本经济新闻”在8月29日发表题为“要正确地评价共产党中国经济”的社论说：“由于共产党中国改正了去年大跃进的统计数字，就认为共产党中国的经济建设一切都不顺利，恐怕也是过分的。就以改正过的去年的实际成绩来说，也是相当大的”。
    这家报纸说：“拥有丰富资源和六亿五千万人口的共产党中国，仍然是有不可估量的潜在力量和能动性的。”“它那种热火朝天地进行经济建设的情况，是自由世界决不可以轻视的。”它认为：“评价过高虽然是非常危险的，但是同时，评价过低，加以轻视，也是不妥当的。”但它又害怕中国建设成就的影响，所以接着就说：“不论什么事情，立刻被外国的事物特别是共产党国家的事物所影响，这样一种态度会犯很大的错误”。
    “北海道新闻”在同一天发表社论说，中共八中全会修改生产指标是为了根据踏实的计划实现“退一步进两步”。
    这家报纸说：去年的生产成绩虽然估计过高了，但是如果同第一个五年计划期间每年平均农业增长5％、工业增长19.2％来比较，不能低估其跃进的步伐。修正了的本年度计划比去年还要高。我们恐怕不能不承认这些事实以及中国领导人适应现实而采取断然措施的果断。
    “东京新闻”在28日发表了社论，它不得不承认：去年是大跃进的一年，“中国的国民生产获得了飞跃的发展”。“人民公社在制度上是非常先进的”，但是它又攻击中国的大跃进和人民公社，胡说“人民公社的生产力很低”、“由于制度和生产力之间有距离，就产生了各种矛盾”。它还造谣说“共产党中国从根本上修正了它对大跃进和人民公社的想法”。它并且把它的妄想流露在这篇社论中，胡说中国的“昂首阔步的姿态不可能永远保持下去”，“如果硬要提高生产”，就会“走向同社会主义相反的方向”。
    日本广播协会电台在8月30日组织了一次座谈，诬蔑中共八届八中全会公报。在这次座谈中，拓殖大学教授草野文雄诽谤中国的大跃进是“拖着人民前进”，是“独裁制度”。他把中国全体人民意气风发地为了迅速建设社会主义而掀起的大跃进说成是“痛苦的”。草野还造谣挑拨说：中国由于经济上的矛盾而在人民中引起了“抵抗”。
