    Zhongtan Commune Transforms Barren Land into Treasure
    Spring Wheat Bumper Harvest with a 40% Increase Over Last Year
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhongtan Commune in Jinji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has transformed barren land into treasure after communization, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest of spring wheat. The entire commune's 8,300 mu of spring wheat yielded an average of 433 jin per mu, an increase of 45.5% over last year, surpassing any previous wheat harvest record in the local history. The broad masses of commune members all say that advanced cooperatives are better than elementary cooperatives, and people's communes are even stronger than advanced cooperatives. In just one year since its establishment, the barren land has been transformed into a treasure land.
    Zhongtan Commune is located on Majiatan in the middle of the Yellow River. With abundant land and a sparse population, it used to be one of the most extensively cultivated areas in the county, with very low grain yields. The commune is surrounded by water on all sides, with low-lying terrain, a high water table, and significant salinity and alkalinity. After the establishment of the commune, it comprehensively planned all cultivated land. On the one hand, it adhered to a reasonable crop rotation system; on the other hand, it improved the soil by methods such as thorough clarification of turbid water, deep plowing and sun exposure, drainage and alkali leaching, and the application of more organic fertilizer. In the past, during the period of agricultural cooperatives, it was impossible to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction. There were water inlet canals on the beach but no drainage ditches, and every year thousands of mu of crops were flooded, resulting in reduced production. When the commune carried out soil improvement, it grasped this key problem, and in accordance with the principle of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange, organized cooperation between teams. It once uniformly deployed more than 880 laborers, worked hard for 45 days, repaired all the canals, opened several large drainage ditches, and built a complete drainage and irrigation canal network. In this way, the major problems that agricultural cooperatives had been unable to solve for several years were solved in one and a half months after the establishment of the commune, laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest of spring wheat. Last winter, the entire commune concentrated 106 laborers, 100 carts, and 300 head of livestock to form a "manure accumulation expeditionary force," buying back 2,500 carts of sheep manure from pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia, 100 to 200 li away. At the same time, it uniformly deployed 340 laborers to form 34 specialized manure accumulation groups, digging 825 high-temperature composting pits and cutting artemisia to compost. In one winter, it solved the problem of all the base fertilizer needed for wheat.
    In carrying out field processing and management, the commune also fully utilized the experience in leading agricultural production during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, implementing political command. At the beginning of spring plowing preparation work, Zhang Zimin, secretary of the commune party committee, Li Xingde, and Hu Wenyu, director of the commune, personally led working groups to inspect land preparation and manure delivery. From wheat sowing to harvesting, they led the comparison and inspection team three times, conducted detailed inspections in the fields block by block, organized cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to conduct "field consultations," and at the same time, selected "pace-setters" in various stages of wheat processing and management, organized on-site observation, and exchanged advanced experiences. These activities effectively promoted the gradual upgrading of wheat seedlings.
    The bumper harvest of wheat has made the cadres and members of the Zhongtan Commune more and more enthusiastic, and they are determined to use the valuable experience of bumper summer crops to strive for autumn crop yields to exceed summer crops.

### 中滩公社改滩地为宝地  春小麦空前丰收比去年增产四成

    中滩公社改滩地为宝地
    春小麦空前丰收比去年增产四成
    据新华社讯　宁夏回族自治区金积县中滩公社在公社化后变滩地为宝地，春小麦空前大丰收。全公社八千三百亩春小麦，平均亩产四百三十三斤，比去年增产45.5％。超过当地历史上任何一年的小麦丰产纪录。广大社员群众都说，高级社比初级社好，人民公社比高级社更强，成立一年，就把滩地改造成宝地了。
    中滩公社在黄河中间的马家滩上，地多人少，以往是全县耕作最粗放的地区之一，粮食产量很低。公社四面环水，地势低洼，地下水位高，盐碱性大。公社成立后，就全面规划了全部耕地，一方面坚持了合理的轮作制度；一方面用彻清澄浑、深耕翻晒、排水洗碱和多施有机质肥料等办法，改良土壤。过去在农业社时期，不可能大规模地兴修水利，滩上有进水渠而没有排水沟，每年总有上千亩庄稼被积水淹涝，造成减产。公社在进行改良土壤时，抓住了这个关键问题，按照互助互利等价交换的原则，组织队与队之间的协作，一次就统一调配了八百八十多个劳力，苦战了四十五天，修整了全部渠道，开了几条大排水沟，建成了一个完整的排灌渠道网。这样，农业社几年来解决不了的大问题，公社成立后，在一个半月的时间内就解决了，为今年春小麦丰收打下了基础。去年冬天，全社集中了一百零六个劳力、一百辆大车和三百头牲口，组成了“积肥远征军”，从一、二百里以外的内蒙古牧区买回羊粪两千五百车。同时又统一调配了三百四十个劳力，组成了三十四个积肥专业组，挖了八百二十五个高温沤肥坑，割蒿子沤肥，一个冬天就解决了小麦所需要的全部底肥。
    在进行田间加工管理时，公社也充分运用了1958年大跃进中领导农业生产的经验，实行政治挂帅。春耕准备工作开始，公社党委书记张自民、李兴德和社主任胡文玉就亲自率领工作组，检查整地、送粪工作。从小麦下种到收割，他们又三次领导评比检查团，深入田间，逐块进行了细致的检查，组织干部、老农和技术人员进行“田间会诊”，同时在小麦加工管理的各个时期都评选出“标兵”，组织现场观摩，交流先进经验，这些活动都有力地促进了麦苗逐步升级。
    小麦大丰收使中滩公社的干部和社员，干劲越来越大，决心运用夏田丰产的宝贵经验，力争秋田产量超过夏田。
