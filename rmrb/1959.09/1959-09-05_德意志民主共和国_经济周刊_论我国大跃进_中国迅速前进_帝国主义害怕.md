Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 4th: The "Economic Weekly" of the German Democratic Republic published an article on September 2nd, titled: "China Continues to Leap Forward." The full text is as follows:

    China's main tasks of the 1958-1962 Five-Year Plan are expected to be completed by the end of this year. China's industrial production increased by 65% in the first half of 1959. In agriculture, despite unfavorable weather, yields per unit area generally increased. The total output of wheat, early rice, and rapeseed was higher than last year's bumper harvest. Retail sales increased by 23%, indicating a rapid improvement in people's living standards.

    The production situation in the first half of 1959 was as follows (the percentages in parentheses indicate the increase compared to the first half of 1958): pig iron, 9.5 million tons (160%); steel produced by modern factories, 5.3 million tons (66%); raw coal, 174 million tons (over 100%); electricity generation, 18.4 billion kilowatt-hours (55%); metal-cutting machine tools, 45,000 units (100%); cotton yarn, 4.147 million bales (46%); sugar, 780,000 tons (43%).

    The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied the state of industrial development and the tasks for this year. Based on past achievements, it believes that the targets for several extremely important products planned to be achieved in 1962 during the Five-Year Plan can be reached by the end of 1959. Thus, it will be possible to complete the main economic task of catching up with Britain in industrial production not in fifteen years as originally planned, but in ten years.

    At the same time, the Central Committee decided to adjust the grain and cotton production targets for this year. This is partly due to natural disasters: many areas of China suffered severe droughts this year, causing great damage to crops. Another reason is based on verifying last year's unprecedented bumper harvest; due to a lack of experience in calculating such huge yields, the estimates were too high.

    Nevertheless, last year's final figures—250 million tons of grain and 2.1 million tons of cotton—were still 35% and 28% higher than in 1957, respectively. This is an extremely satisfactory increase. In the capitalist economic system, countries that can be compared, such as India, had a harvest in 1958 that was lower than in 1957, and even in good years, the increase in production is very small.

    This year, although the climatic conditions are poor (which in the past would have caused famine), China will still be able to increase production by 10% over last year's brilliant achievements. This is because, through the selfless labor of the peasants, many arid areas are now artificially irrigated. The enormous effects of their efforts will be fully manifested in the future.

    We must say a few words about the attitude of the Western press. The Western press has been issuing various slanders against China regarding the aforementioned modifications to planned figures and some other aspects. The coal target for 1959 is now set at 335 million tons, and the steel target is set at 12 million tons, because the local output of the communes is no longer included in the state plan figures. Western commentators are silent about the fact that China is actually advancing at a speed never seen in capitalist history. It is understandable that the capitalist press does not like China's progress, because imperialists are very afraid of the impact this will have on countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are still under capitalist control. If they now intend to belittle China's progress, then they should remember the consequences of the same self-deceiving estimates they made about the Soviet Union.

    德意志民主共和国“经济周刊”论我国大跃进
    中国迅速前进　帝国主义害怕
    新华社柏林4日电　德意志民主共和国“经济周刊”9月2日刊载了一篇文章，题目是：“中国在继续跃进”，全文如下：
    中国1958—1962年五年计划的主要任务可望于今年年底完成。中国的工业生产在1959年上半年增长了65％。在农业方面，虽然气候不好，可是，单位面积产量普遍增加了。小麦、早稻、油菜籽的总产量高于去年的特大丰收。零售贸易额增长23％，这说明人民生活水平迅速提高。
    1959年上半年生产情况如下（括弧内是比1958年上半年增加的百分比）：生铁九百五十万吨（160％）；现代化工厂生产的钢五百三十万吨（66％）；原煤一亿七千四百万吨（100％以上）；发电量一百八十四亿度（55％）；金属切削机床四万五千台（100％）；棉纱四百一十四万七千件（46％）；糖七十八万吨（43％）。
    中国共产党八届八中全会研究了工业发展状况和今年的任务，依据过去的成就认为五年计划中预定在1962年实现的若干极重要产品的指标到1959年底就可以达到。这样，就将可能不像原来计划的那样用十五年时间而是用十年的时间就完成这个主要经济任务：在工业生产上赶上英国。
    同时，中央委员会决定调整今年的粮棉生产指标。其部分原因是由于自然灾害：今年中国许多地区遭受严重旱灾，庄稼受到很大危害。另一个原因是根据核实去年的空前丰收，由于在计算如此巨额的产量方面缺乏经验，是估得多了。
    虽然如此，去年的最后数字——粮食两亿五千万吨，棉花二百一十万吨——仍然分别比1957年多35％和28％。这是极其令人满意的增长。在资本主义经济体系中，可以拿来作比较的国家，如印度，1958年的收成低于1957年，即使在好年景，增产也是很小的。
    今年，虽然气候条件恶劣（在过去，这会引起饥荒），中国仍将能够比去年的辉煌成就再增加10％。这是因为经过农民的忘我劳动，现在许多干旱地区得到人工灌溉。他们的努力的巨大效果，今后将充分显现出来。
    对于西方报纸的态度，我们必须讲几句话。西方报纸针对中国在计划数字方面所作的上述修改和其他一些方面的修改发出种种谰言。1959年煤的指标现在订为三亿三千五百万吨，钢的指标订为一千二百万吨，因为公社的地方产量不再列入国家计划数字。西方的评论家们对下列事实缄口不言：中国实际上是用在资本主义历史上从来没有过的速度前进着。资本主义报纸不喜欢中国的进展，是可以理解的，因为帝国主义者十分害怕这会对亚非和拉丁美洲那些仍然处于资本主义控制下的国家产生影响。如果他们现在打算贬低中国的进展，那么，他们应记得他们对苏联的情况所作的同样自欺欺人估计的后果。
