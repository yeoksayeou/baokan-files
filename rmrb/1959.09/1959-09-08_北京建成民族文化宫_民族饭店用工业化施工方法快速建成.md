	Beijing Completes the National Culture Palace
	Nationalities Hotel Rapidly Built Using Industrialized Construction Methods

	(Our Newspaper) Beijing News: The National Culture Palace, featuring ethnic characteristics, has been completed in Beijing.

	The National Culture Palace has a construction area of more than 30,700 square meters. The floor plan resembles the Chinese character "山" (mountain). The two wings are symmetrical three-story buildings, with a central section rising to thirteen stories. The architects, considering artistic treatment and ethnic style, arranged it as a high-rise tower building. From the ground to the top of the tower, it is sixty-seven meters high, the same height as the White Pagoda in Beihai Park, the tallest building in the city.

	The main structural engineering of this building began in early October last year. The construction period was tight, the structure complex, and the quality requirements high. The 1,500 workers undertaking this construction task, under the illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, put forward the fighting slogan of "Fight hard for sixty days and plant the red flag on the top of the tower," and launched a labor competition between teams, groups, and individuals. Under the premise of ensuring quality, a rapid construction movement was launched. They adopted the construction method of "continuous formwork and continuous pouring," completing an average of one floor every three and a half days. As a result, the main structural engineering was completed in only forty-seven days, thirteen days ahead of the original leap forward plan. According to the general construction speed in the past, it would have taken at least one hundred and fifty days to complete.

	After the project entered the decoration stage, the weather was cold, and there were many difficulties in the exterior wall decoration. The applied facing bricks often fell off automatically. However, the workers became more enthusiastic. They wrote on the guarantee: "The cold weather cannot cool our enthusiasm; the difficulties are many, but not more than our wisdom." Workers, technicians, and leading cadres, after several experiments, studied the method of adding antifreeze and quick-setting agents to the sand, ensuring the quality and speed of the facing brick laying. While speeding up the construction, they also established a quality supervision system combining self-inspection, mutual inspection, and special inspection to ensure that the project quality met the design requirements.

	People of all ethnic groups across the country actively supported the construction of this project. Eleven provinces and cities transferred a large number of workers to this construction site, and more than sixty factories processed and manufactured equipment for it. The people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region sent copper and wood to this project. Minority students from the Central University for Nationalities and the affiliated middle school of the Central University for Nationalities, among other units, participated in voluntary labor here more than 10,000 times, from the excavation of the foundation to the cleanup of the site.

	The National Culture Palace is located on Beijing's main thoroughfare, West Chang'an Avenue, about three kilometers from Tiananmen Square in the city center, with convenient transportation.

	(Our Newspaper) Beijing News: The Nationalities Hotel, built with industrialized construction methods, has now been rapidly completed in Beijing.

	This thirteen-story building has an area of 34,000 square meters. From the beginning of hoisting to the end of the project, it only took one hundred and twenty working days, which is twice as efficient as general construction methods. After inspection, the project quality is also very good.

	This is currently the tallest building in our country constructed using industrialized construction methods. More than 6,000 main components of more than 800 types, such as room panels, walkway panels, beams, air duct panels, and balconies inside the building, were prefabricated in component factories according to design requirements, and then transported to the site for assembly with cranes. Each component weighed an average of two and a half tons, and the largest weighed more than four tons. The floor of a guest room is one component.

	During the construction process, the workers adopted the method of simultaneous construction, technical research, and improvement of construction operations to overcome technical difficulties. The forty-meter-high tower crane could not hoist buildings higher than the eighth floor. The workers and experts and technicians studied and raised the crane tower by more than ten meters, solving the difficulty of not being able to find a higher tower crane.

	This building, located near Xidan in Beijing, has a simple and elegant form. Inside, there are a total of 597 guest rooms, each with a full set of sanitary and plumbing equipment. The first and second floors have Chinese, Western, and halal restaurants. The eleventh floor has a tea room, barbershop, and games room.

	This hotel was built by the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company and the Beijing Mechanical Construction Company. During the construction process, it received assistance from the Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Technical Research Institute of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and other units.

### 北京建成民族文化宫  民族饭店用工业化施工方法快速建成

    北京建成民族文化宫
    民族饭店用工业化施工方法快速建成
    本报讯　具有民族风格的民族文化宫已在北京建成。
    民族文化宫的建筑面积为三万零七百多平方米。平面像一个“山”字，两翼是对称的三层建筑，中央部分高达十三层。建筑师在设计时，考虑到艺术处理和民族风格，把它布置成高层塔式建筑。从地面到塔顶，高达六十七米，和城内最高建筑物——北海公园的白塔一样高。
    这项建筑的主体结构工程从去年10月初开始兴建。工期紧、结构复杂，质量要求高。担负这项建设任务的一千五百名工人，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，提出“大战六十天，把红旗插上塔顶”的战斗口号，开展了队与队、组与组、个人与个人之间的劳动竞赛。在保证质量的前提下，大搞快速施工运动。他们采取了“连续支模，连续浇灌”的施工方法，平均三天半就建成一层楼房。结果，只用四十七天就完成了主体结构工程，比原先制订的跃进计划还提前了十三天。按照过去一般的施工速度，至少需要一百五十天才能完成。
    工程进入装修阶段以后，气候寒冷，外墙装修有许多困难，贴上去的面砖常常自动掉下来。工人们干劲却越鼓越足。他们在保证书上写道：“天气寒冷，冷不了我们的热心；困难虽多，多不过我们的智慧。”工人、技术人员和领导干部一起经过几次试验，研究出在砂子里面加抗冻剂、快强剂的方法，保证了贴面砖的质量和速度。他们在加快施工速度的同时，还建立了自检、互检和专人检查相结合的质量监督制度，使工程质量达到了设计要求。
    全国各族人民积极支援这项工程的建设。十一个省、市抽调了大批工人到这个工地，六十多个工厂为它加工制造了器材。内蒙古自治区、广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区的人民，给这个工程送来了铜和木料。中央民族学院和中央民族学院附属中学等单位的少数民族学生，从开挖基础工程到清理现场，先后有一万多人次在这里参加了义务劳动。
    民族文化宫座落在北京的主要干道——西长安街上，离市中心天安门约三公里，交通方便。
    本报讯　用工业化施工方法兴建的民族饭店，现已在北京迅速建成。
    这座十三层大楼的建筑物，面积达三万四千多平方米。从开始吊装到工程结束，只用了一百二十个工作日，比一般施工方法提高时效两倍，经过检验，工程质量也很好。
    这是目前我国采取工业化施工的一座最高建筑物。建筑物里面的房间板、走道板、大梁、风道板、阳台等八百多种六千多件主要构件，都是按照设计要求，先在构件工厂里预制好，然后运到现场用起重机装配的。每个构件平均重二吨半，最大的重四吨多，一个客房的楼板，就是一块构件。
    在施工过程中，工人们采取边施工、边钻研技术、边改进施工操作的方法，来克服技术上的困难。四十公尺多高的塔式起重机不能吊装八层以上的建筑物，工人们和专家、技术人员研究，把起重机塔接高了十公尺多，解决了找不到更高的塔式起重机的困难。
    这座位置在北京西单附近的建筑，形式朴素、大方，里面共有五百九十七间客房，每个房间都有全套卫生设备和水暖设备。第一层和第二层设有中、西餐厅和清真餐厅。第十一层有茶厅、理发室、球室等。
    这个饭店是北京市第四建筑工程公司和北京市机械施工公司建造的。在兴建过程中，得到建筑工程部科学研究院、北京市建筑工程局技术研究所等单位的协助。（附图片）
