    An Initiative
    Wu Han
    Someone once said that roads are made by people walking on them, and articles are squeezed out by people. In the past, I thought these two sentences were correct.
    After this year, my view has changed. Modern roads are created by the labor of the people, because roads made by walking can only be walked on, and are not suitable for ten-wheeled trucks. Modern roads must be dug by road workers with excavators, paved with stones, asphalt or cement, and flattened with road rollers. They require enormous labor. Relying solely on people's two legs to walk on cannot create such roads.
    Similarly, articles cannot be squeezed out alone. If you don't squeeze, it doesn't mean there won't be any. Writing articles requires enthusiasm. With this enthusiasm, squeezing is necessary, and not squeezing is also imperative. Having a bone stuck in your throat and needing to spit it out is passive and not right. To describe it more accurately, it's being so happy that you have something to say, and you must say it, must write it.
    Must say it, must write it, is my mood today. Of course, there are also aspects squeezing you, squeezing you to write. First, I want to write myself, I need to write, not writing feels awkward. Second, plus the external force of squeezing, then the article comes out, not only is it written, but the quantity is also large.
    This year is a year of the Great Leap Forward for the whole people. I have written about 100,000 words of essays, preparing to publish a collection of essays. I compiled a part of the essays written before liberation, titled "Javelin Collection," which will be published soon. I have sorted out more than 3 million words of "Chinese Historical Materials from the Veritable Records of the Korean Joseon Dynasty" copied more than 20 years ago, which has already gone to print.
    This is my gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    In the future, I will set a plan for myself to write at least 100,000 words every year and publish a book a year. I want to engage in scientific research, write some specialized papers, and also engage in popularization work, write some reading notes, compile some popular books, and write some clear and easy-to-understand articles.
    The biography of Zhu Yuanzhang, which was rewritten for the third time five years ago, will also be rewritten and published again next year.
    I have that much enthusiasm, I must write, not writing makes me uncomfortable.
    Where does this enthusiasm come from? It comes from the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It comes from the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking, doubling production in one year. It comes from the people's communes, with all cooperatives in the country becoming communalized in a few months. It comes from the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Huairou Reservoir, and the Miyun Reservoir. It comes from the expansion of Tiananmen Square, where tens of thousands of workers, regardless of cold or heat, regardless of wind or rain, work selflessly day and night.
    The people of the whole country are in the Great Leap Forward, their enthusiasm soaring to the sky! As for me, in addition to my job duties, I also have a pen. This pen has been used in the past, but has been idle for many years. Shouldn't I make an effort and serve socialist construction?
    This year is the year I have written the most in my life. In the past, there was also a year when I wrote the most essays, that was in 1946, when the Kuomintang's white terror was at its worst. However, the mood was completely different. That year, the mood was heavy and indignant. That pen was used to fight the enemy. Now, I use this pen to sing the praises of the Great Leap Forward, sing the praises of the General Line, sing the praises of the Communist Party, and sing the praises of Chairman Mao with a joyful, inspiring, and striding mood.
    Why have I written so little in the past nine years, and this pen has been almost too heavy to use? Because there are still some ideological problems. I forgive myself, the work is busy, I can't write, that's one reason. Even if I have some time sometimes, it is very fragmented, writing a few lines today, and then continuing to write after many days. The writing is not coherent, so I can't write well. I might as well wait until I have time to write, that's another reason. More importantly, I think I am not a writer, writing is the business of writers, why not be modest and do what I can? That's another reason. Also, my professional level is not high, and I can't even talk about theory. I don't write—anyway, there is no writing task, I can hide my clumsiness. If I write and make mistakes, I will be criticized. I am timid and afraid of making mistakes, not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit, that's another reason.
    Once the General Line was put forward, and the bugle call of the Great Leap Forward sounded, these ideological problems were solved. Busy does not mean that there is no writing time at all. The problem is how to make good use of it. The time is fragmented, write when you have time, and don't write when you don't have time. Writing a little is better than not writing at all. The brain and hands are my own. Even if I am not a writer, I can learn to write. If I don't write well, as long as I am willing to work hard, there will always be a day when I can write well. If the level is not high, it will not be improved if I don't write. To write, I must read more books and learn more theory, which can be improved naturally in practice, and can only be improved through practice. There will definitely be mistakes. Not writing does not mean that there are no mistakes in my thinking. How can I correct mistakes if I hide them? On the contrary, only by writing them out and having everyone point out the mistakes can I effectively correct them. In this way, the ideological problems are solved, the enthusiasm comes, the pen is no longer heavy, and the articles are written. Friends pointed out my mistakes in words, letters, and articles. I corrected some mistakes, and my confidence is stronger and my enthusiasm is greater.
    Summarizing my experience over the past year, articles are brought out by going all out and squeezing them out, and obtained by aiming high and striving for the top. I also write a lot and write quickly. As for good and economical, I still have to continue to work hard, and I believe there will be a day when I can do it.
    After this year, the more I think about this experience, the more I feel it makes sense. Although it is not so rare, I still think it should be written out as an initiative. Not writing it out also makes me feel uncomfortable.
    I dare not be so bold as to propose an initiative to writers. I only propose an initiative to the comrades of the national government agencies and those who are aspiring to write, asking everyone to respond to the Party's call, go all out, aim high, and write a little something with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, each person writing a little something every year to serve socialist construction!
    I put forward this initiative, and I also use this initiative to urge and spur myself on.
    Long live the Party's General Line!

专栏：

    一个倡议
  　吴晗
    有人说过，路是人走出来的，文章是人挤出来的，从前，我认为这两句话是对的。
    经过这一年，我的看法改变了。现代的路是人们的劳动创造出来的，因为走出来的路只能给人走，还不适合于十轮大卡车走。现代的路，必须道路工人挖土机挖，用石子、沥青或水泥铺装，用压路机压平，要经过巨大的劳动，光靠人两条腿走，是走不出这样的路来的。
    同样，文章也不能光靠挤，不挤，不是就没有了。写文章得有干劲，有这股子劲，挤固然要写，不挤也非写不可。骨梗在喉，非吐不可，是消极的，不对头。形容得确切一些，是高兴得有话想说，非说不可，非写不可。
    非说不可，非写不可，是我今天的心情。当然，也还有各方面在挤，挤你非写不可。一来是自己想写，要写，不写出来很别扭，二来加上外力的挤，于是文章出来了，不但写出来了，而且数量还很多。
    这一年，全民大跃进的一年。我写了十万字左右的杂文，预备出一本杂文集，编了解放前写的一部分杂文，题名投枪集，不久可以出版。整理了二十多年前抄的“朝鲜李朝实录中之中国史料”，约三百万字，已经付印。
    这就是我对国庆十周年的献礼。
    以后呢，我自己订下计划，每年至少写十万字，一年出一本书。要搞科学研究，写一些专门论文，也要搞普及工作，写一些读书札记，编一些通俗的书，写一些明白易晓的文章。
    五年前第三次改写的朱元璋传，也要在明年内再次改写出版。
    就有那末一股子劲，非写不可，不写，很难受。
    这股子劲来自何处？来自党的总路线，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。来自大炼钢铁，一年内产量翻一番。来自人民公社，几个月内全国的合作社都公社化了。来自十三陵水库，怀柔水库，密云水库。来自天安门广场的扩建，多少万工人不间寒暑，不避风雨，日日夜夜的忘我劳动。
    全国人民都在大跃进，干劲冲天！我呢，除岗位工作之外，还有一支笔，这支笔过去曾经使用过，闲了多少年，不该努一把力，为社会主义建设服务吗？
    这一年，是我生平写作最多的一年。过去，也曾经有一年，我写作杂文最多的一年，那是1946年，国民党白色恐怖最厉害的时候。但是，心情完全不同。那一年，心情沉重，愤慨，这支笔是用来和敌人作战的。现在呢，我以欢欣鼓舞，昂首阔步的心情，用这支笔歌颂大跃进，歌颂总路线，歌颂共产党，歌颂毛主席。
    为什么过去九年写得很少，这支笔几乎重得不能使了呢？因为还有些思想问题，自己原谅自己，工作忙，写不了，其一也。即使有时候有点时间，但很零碎，今天写几行，隔多少天再接着写，文气不贯，写不好，索性等有时间再写，其二也。更主要的是以为自己并非作家，写作是作家们的事，干吗不度德，不量力呢？其三也。还有，业务水平不高，理论呢，更谈不上，不写——横竖没有写的任务，可以藏拙，写了出了错，反而受批评，畏首畏尾，不求有功，但求无过，其四也。
    总路线一提出，大跃进的号角一响，这些思想问题解决了。忙，不等于完全没有写作时间，问题在于如何妥善利用。时间零碎，有工夫就写，没工夫就不写，写一点是一点，总比不写好。脑子和手是自己的，不是作家也可以学着写。写不好，只要肯用功，总有写好的一天。水平不高，不写就更提不高，要写就得多看书，多学理论，在实践中自然可以提高，也只有实践才能提高。错处一定会有，不写并不等于思想中没有错误，隐藏错误，又如何能改正错误？相反，只有写出来，大家指出了错误，才能有效地改正错误。这样，思想问题解决了，劲头来了，笔也不重了，文章写出来了。朋友们在口头上，信件上，文章上指出我的错误，我改正了一些错误，信心更足了，劲头也更大了。
    总结我一年来的经验，文章是鼓足干劲，鼓出来的，力争上游，争出来的。我也写得多，写得快。至于好和省，那还得继续努力，相信会有那末一天，可以做到。
    这一点经验，经过这一年，越想越觉得有道理。虽然不那么稀罕，还是认为应该把它写出来，作为一个倡议，不写出来，也觉得很难受。
    我不敢那么大胆，向作家们倡议。我只向全国的机关干部同志们，有志于写作者倡议，大家来响应党的号召，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地写一点东西，每人每年写一点东西，为社会主义建设服务吧！
    我提出这个倡议，也以这个倡议来督促、鞭策自己。
    党的总路线万岁！
