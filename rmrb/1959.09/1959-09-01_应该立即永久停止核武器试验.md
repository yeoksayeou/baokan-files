Nuclear Weapon Tests Should Be Stopped Immediately and Permanently
By People's Daily Commentator

    Due to the pressure of world public opinion, and due to the upcoming visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, the United States has recently made a new gesture on the issue of stopping nuclear weapon tests: it announced that it would extend the one-year period of temporary suspension of nuclear weapon tests, which the United States began in October of last year, to the end of this year. At the same time, Britain also stated that it does not intend to resume nuclear weapon tests while the tripartite Soviet-American-British conference on stopping nuclear weapon tests is still engaged in beneficial discussions. What does this mean? This means that the United States and Britain are still adhering to their original position, opposing the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests, and merely extending the period of temporary suspension of nuclear weapon tests by a little bit – only two months. However, despite this, the Soviet Union has once again made an active and proactive effort to strive for the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests. On August 28, the Soviet government declared that if Western countries do not resume atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, the Soviet Union will not resume nuclear explosions. The Soviet government reiterated that it is willing to immediately sign an agreement with the governments of the United States and Britain on the permanent cessation of all types of nuclear weapon tests.
    For the governments of the United States and Britain, this is a new test.
    The matter is very clear: as long as the United States and Britain can, like the Soviet Union, be willing to immediately sign an agreement on the permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests, then this problem will not be difficult to solve. Or, to take a step back, as long as the United States and Britain agree not to resume nuclear weapon tests for a considerably long period of time (certainly not two months, nor one or two years), and the Soviet Union will of course not resume nuclear explosions, then this will also help ease international tensions. It can be seen that, from now on, whether the people of the world will hear the sound of nuclear weapon test explosions again depends entirely on the Western countries.
    Past facts have proven that the so-called temporary cessation of nuclear weapon tests by Western countries is actually just a gap between two tests, and is not intended to truly stop testing. The Soviet Union's consistent advocacy of the immediate, permanent, and complete cessation of all types of nuclear weapon tests is a truly sincere expression of peace. In order to strive for the realization of this lofty goal, the Soviet Union unilaterally stopped nuclear explosions on March 31 of last year, and called on the United States and Britain to respond to this initiative, but they rejected the Soviet Union's suggestion. On October 30 of the same year, on the eve of the convening of the tripartite Soviet-American-British conference on stopping nuclear weapon tests, the Soviet Union again issued a statement requesting the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests, but the United States and Britain rejected it again. Now, the Geneva conference on stopping nuclear weapon tests has been going on for ten months. Although the conference has passed seventeen articles and the preamble of the treaty banning nuclear tests, the conference has still not completed its task due to the stubborn position of the Western countries. Especially on the issue of the organization of the monitoring system, Western countries have put forward many absurd demands, such as opposing the principle of equality between East and West and the principle of unanimity among the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain in deciding major issues, in order to delay negotiations and obstruct the reaching of an agreement. At the same time, while announcing the suspension of nuclear weapon tests for one year, the United States is actively preparing for new nuclear weapon tests. According to a recent report in the "New York Post," the United States Atomic Energy Commission has even ordered the digging of tunnels to prepare for new underground nuclear weapon tests. The newspaper also said that the United States' "plans for continued testing in high altitudes are underway." It can be seen that the United States' so-called "suspension of testing for one year" (or plus two months) is actually just preparing for the continuation of new tests.
    The permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests is an important step in stopping the arms race and banning nuclear weapons. In order to eliminate the threat of nuclear war to billions of human beings, in order to promote the peaceful coexistence of all countries, and in order to defend world peace, the people of the world are determined to fight for the permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests and the banning of nuclear weapons. The call issued by the recently concluded Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has been responded to by the people of all countries. Similarly, the Soviet Union's new proposal on the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests will also be approved and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The world believes that it is time for the United States and other Western countries to change their past stubborn attitude and agree to the immediate and permanent cessation of nuclear weapon tests.

    应该立即永久停止核武器试验	本报评论员
    由于全世界舆论的压力，由于赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将互相访问，美国最近又在停止核武器试验问题上作出一个新的姿态：它宣布把美国从去年10月开始的暂时停止核武器试验一年的期限，延长到今年年底。同时，英国也表示，在苏美英三国停止核武器试验的会议还在进行有益的讨论的时候，它不打算恢复核武器试验。这是什么意思呢？这就是说，美英两国仍然坚持原来的立场，反对立即永久停止核武器试验，而只是把暂时停止核武器试验的期限延长了一点——仅仅是两个月。可是，尽管如此，苏联却又一次为争取立即永久停止核武器试验作出积极主动的努力。8月28日，苏联政府声明，如果西方国家不恢复原子武器和氢武器试验，苏联将不恢复核爆炸。苏联政府再次重申，它愿意立即同美英两国政府签订关于永久停止各种核武器试验的协议。
    对于美英两国政府来说，这是一次新的考验。
    事情非常明白，只要美英两国也能够同苏联一样，愿意立即签订永久停止核武器试验的协议，那么，这个问题就不难解决了。或者退一步讲，只要美英同意在相当长的时期内（当然不是两个月，也不是一年两年）不恢复核武器试验，而苏联当然也不会恢复核爆炸，那么，这也将有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。由此可见，从现在开始，全世界人民是否还要再听到核武器试验的爆炸声，其责任完全在于西方国家了。
    过去的种种事实证明，西方国家的所谓暂时停止核武器试验，实际上不过是两次试验中间的间隙，并不是打算真正停止试验。而苏联一贯主张立即永远完全停止一切类型的核武器试验，才是真正具有和平诚意的表现。为了争取实现这个崇高的目标，苏联在去年3月31日曾单方面停止核爆炸，并呼吁美国和英国响应这个倡议，但是它们拒绝了苏联的这个建议。同年10月30日，在苏美英三国停止核武器试验会议召开的前夕，苏联又曾经发表声明，要求立即永久停止核武器试验，但是美国和英国又拒绝了。现在，日内瓦停止核武器试验会议已经开了十个月。虽然会议通过了禁止核试验条约的十七条条文和前言，但由于西方国家的顽固立场，会议仍然没有完成它的任务。特别是在监督系统的组织问题上，西方国家提出许多荒谬的主张，例如反对东西方对等的原则和在决定重大问题时苏美英三国一致的原则等等，借以拖延谈判，阻挠达成协议。在这同时，美国一边宣布停止核武器试验一年，一边就积极准备新的核武器试验。据最近“纽约邮报”透露，美国原子能委员会甚至命令挖掘隧道，准备在地下开始进行核武器的新试验。这家报纸并且说，美国“在高层空间继续试验的计划正在进行”。可见美国所谓“停止试验一年”（或者再加上两个月），实际上不过是为继续新试验作准备而已。
    永久停止核武器试验，是停止军备竞赛和禁止核武器的一个重要步骤。为了消除核战争对亿万人类的威胁，为了促进各国人民的和平共处，为了保卫世界和平，全世界人民决心为永久停止核武器试验和禁止核武器而斗争。最近刚刚闭幕的第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会所发出的号召，已经得到各国人民的响应。同样，苏联关于立即永久停止核武器试验的新建议，也将得到全世界爱好和平人民的赞同和支持。全世界都认为，美国和其他西方国家改变过去的顽固态度，同意立即永久停止核武器试验，此其时矣。
