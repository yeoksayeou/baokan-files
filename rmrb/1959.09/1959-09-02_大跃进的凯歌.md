    A Triumphant Song of the Great Leap Forward By our reporter
    At the foot of the ancient Great Wall, in the strategic area of the Chao River, two towering main flood control dams and seventeen secondary dams rise abruptly, connecting many mountain peaks into an arc-shaped copper wall and iron barrier. In August, the Chao River saw a flood peak unprecedented in forty-one years, roaring and rushing towards the dam. However, it was stopped by the dam!
    The reservoir project is complex and massive. Originally, it was scheduled to begin at the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, but it was advanced to the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. According to convention, the construction of such a project would take five years. Now, the builders of the reservoir, displaying soaring enthusiasm and a high degree of communist collaboration, have completed about 70% of the total project volume in one year. This is a red flag raised by the people of Hebei Province and the suburbs of Beijing under the illumination of the Party's socialist general line; it is a song of triumph in the Great Leap Forward of the motherland.
    Since construction began last September, the reservoir construction site has been seething day and night. Here, red flags are waving, tamping songs are loud and clear, blasting cannons shake the earth, and handcarts shuttle back and forth. Trains whistle, cars speed by. Sand and gravel pour down from conveyor belts, and sheep-foot rollers create continuous waves of earth. Millions of lively and vigorous warriors, operating all kinds of tools, are fiercely and rapidly attacking, waging war against nature... Here, people can hear the footsteps of the Great Leap Forward of the motherland and see how the people armed with the general line are filled with such heroic spirit and lofty aspirations.
    Right-leaning opportunists say that the Great Leap Forward is not good, that the Great Leap Forward is too tense. However, the working people, who have suffered from class oppression and natural disasters for thousands of years, know that without tense struggle, they cannot liberate themselves or overcome natural disasters. Last August and September, after the news of the decision to start construction of the reservoir spread, the people in Hebei and Beijing who had suffered from the Chao River floods were enthusiastic and excited. They surged towards the construction site like a tide, asking to participate in the reservoir project. To get approval to work at the site, some old men shaved off their beards, and some young people postponed their weddings. The first batch of migrant workers from Ji County braved torrential rain and scorching sun, traveling more than 400 li in two and a half days to rush to the construction site and sign up. The local people gave priority to sending their strongest children to the construction site. Li Shixi, a special model of the Thirteen Tombs and a one-armed hero of the Xinghuo Commune in Chaoyang District, Beijing, returned home shortly after completing the Thirteen Tombs project. Upon hearing the news that the Miyun Reservoir had started construction, he rushed to the construction site and signed up. On the second day of arriving at the construction site, he organized a shock brigade, asking to take on the most arduous tasks.
    The 200,000-strong army fighting on the reservoir construction site were all elated and full of energy. Not only were they not afraid of the tense situation, but they also vigorously carried out technical innovations to improve work efficiency and accelerate the progress of the project. In the early stages of construction, due to a lack of machinery, the migrant workers used handcarts and earthen baskets to go up the dam and created various "indigenous" machines. In November and December of last year alone, 123 new tools appeared. The "lever-type track lifter" created by railway worker Wang Lianjian increased work efficiency eightfold, and the "flip-type" material platform he created increased the efficiency of loading cars tenfold. When a large number of machines arrived at the construction site, the construction encountered the difficulty of a lack of skilled workers. The builders insisted on self-reliance. They learned while working, and within a short period, more than 7,000 tractor drivers, truck drivers, conveyor belt and hydropower technicians emerged from among the migrant workers.
    Winter arrived, and the temperature at the construction site dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius, but the builders did not bow their heads to the difficulties. Some migrant workers were suspended on cliffs more than 50 meters high, cutting slopes and splitting ridges in the cold northwest wind. To obtain materials, they had to break through a one- or two-meter-thick frozen layer. Many people's hands were cracked. Not only did they overcome the severe cold, but on December 7 last year, they also created a national record of 300,4813 cubic meters of dam body filling.
    The victory of the reservoir in flood control is a triumphant song of the Great Leap Forward. This song can only be sung by heroic people who are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of tension, uncompromising, and full of love and confidence in life!
    "The Party plants the happy trees, the commune opens the happy flowers; the people build the happy reservoir, and the happy life will come." The people at the construction site clearly know that without the leadership of the Party and without communization, it would have been impossible for the people to build such a large water conservancy project, let alone have the project progress so rapidly.
    Communization provided the reservoir construction with strong human and material conditions, but more importantly, it raised the ideological consciousness of the people and cultivated the communist spirit of collaboration among the people. There are 190,000 migrant workers at the construction site, from more than 180 people's communes in 21 counties and districts in Hebei Province and Beijing. They not only brought great labor enthusiasm, but also carried a large number of handcarts, shovels, hoes, hammers, wood and other construction tools and materials. For the construction of the reservoir, Miyun County needed to relocate more than 56,300 people, demolish more than 53,700 houses, and occupy more than 161,000 mu of cultivated land. Because each people's commune made overall arrangements, many people in neighboring villages and communes vacated houses, swept courtyards, sent cars, sent boats, and sent representatives to receive these relocated members like welcoming relatives. People did not feel any difficulty. They happily settled down and lived and worked in peace and contentment. Such things would have been impossible before communization.
    During the project, each commune, on the one hand, extracted a large number of the strongest laborers and transferred them to Miyun, and on the other hand, intensified production in the rear to ensure the overall leap forward and bumper harvest in their hometowns. Each commune gave priority to taking care of the families of migrant workers, and normally recorded work points for migrant workers. When winter came, the communes sent cotton clothes and gloves to the migrant workers; when summer came, the communes sent summer medicines and towels, etc. After the reservoir construction, the people loved the communes even more, because loving the communes also meant building the communes more vigorously.
    The victory of the reservoir in flood control is a victory of the Party's leadership, a victory of the general line, a victory of the Great Leap Forward, and a victory of the people's communes!

### 大跃进的凯歌

    大跃进的凯歌	本报记者
    古长城脚下，潮白河的咽喉地带，两座高耸的拦洪主坝和十七座副坝，异峰突起，把许多个山头连成弧形的铜墙铁壁。8月里，潮白河四十一年从未发生过的洪峰，奔腾咆哮地向大坝冲来。但是，它被大坝拦住了！
    水库工程复杂巨大，原来预定在第三个五年计划末期开工，现在提前到第二个五年计划的第一年就开工了；按照常规，建筑这样的工程需要五年的时间。现在，水库的建设者们发挥了冲天的干劲和高度共产主义协作精神，一年内就完成了工程总量70％左右。这是河北省和北京市郊区人民在党的社会主义总路线照耀下竖起的一面红旗，是祖国大跃进中的一曲凯歌。
    从去年9月开工建筑以来，水库工地上日夜沸腾着。这里，红旗招展，夯歌嘹亮，开山炮惊天动地，手推车往来如梭。火车长鸣，汽车奔驰。皮带机上砂料飞泻，羊脚碾下土浪连绵。千千万万生龙活虎的战士，操纵着一切工具，猛打猛冲，向自然开战……这里，使人们听到了祖国大跃进的脚步声，看到了被总路线武装了思想的人民，是怎样的气吞山河，壮志凌云。
    右倾机会主义分子说大跃进不好，说大跃进过于紧张，但是，几千年来深受阶级压迫和自然灾害的劳动人民，他们知道没有紧张的战斗就解放不了自己，也战胜不了自然灾害。去年8、9月间，水库决定开工兴建的消息传出去后，河北、北京地区受过潮白河水灾的人民，热情激昂，他们像潮水般地涌向工地，要求参加水库工程。为了取得工地的批准，有的老人剃掉胡子，有的青年推迟了婚期，蓟县第一批民工冒着暴雨，顶着烈日，用两天半的时间疾行四百多里，赶到工地争先报名，当地的人民把自己最强壮的子弟优先送到了工地。十三陵特等模范、北京朝阳区星火公社的单臂英雄李世喜，在完成十三陵工程后回到家里不久，听到密云水库开工的消息，就赶到工地报了名。到工地的第二天，他组织了一支突击队，要求担当最艰巨的任务。
    水库工地上战斗着的二十万大军个个兴高彩烈、干劲百倍，他们不但不害怕紧张，还大闹技术革命提高工率，加速工程进度。开工初期，缺乏机械，民工们就用手推车，用土筐上坝，并且创造了各种“土”机械。仅去年11、12月份就出现了一百二十三种新工具。铁路工人王连俭创造的“压杠式起道机”，提高工效八倍，他创造的“翻板式”料台，使装汽车的工效提高了十倍。当大量机械到达工地以后，工地碰到没有技术工人的困难，建设者坚持自力更生，他们边学边作、边作边学，在短期里，民工中就出现了七千多名拖拉机手、汽车司机、皮带运输机和水电技工等。
    冬季到了，工地的气温降低到零下二十度，但建设者们没有向困难低头。有些民工吊在高达五十多米高的悬崖陡壁上，在寒冷的西北风中削坡劈岭。为了取料，要破开一两米厚的冻层，许多人把手震裂了，他们不但战胜了严寒，去年12月7日，还创造了坝身填筑三十万零四千八百一十三立方米的全国最高纪录。
    水库拦洪胜利是一曲大跃进的凯歌，这首凯歌只有不畏艰巨、不怕紧张、不妥协，对生活充满热爱和信心的英雄人民才唱得出来！
    “幸福的树儿党来栽，幸福的花儿公社开；幸福的水库人民造，幸福的生活就来到。”工地上的人们清楚地知道，没有党的领导，没有公社化，人民根本没有可能建设这样大的水利工程，更不用说工程进展得这样神速。
    公社化给水库建设提供了雄厚的人力和物质条件，但是重要的是它提高了人民的思想觉悟，培养人民的共产主义协作精神。工地上有十九万民工，来自河北省和北京市二十一个县区一百八十多个人民公社，他们不但带来了巨大的劳动热忱，还携带着大批手推车、锹、镐、锤、木材等施工工具和材料。为建筑水库，密云县需要迁出五万六千三百多人，拆迁房屋五万三千七百多间，占耕地十六万一千多亩，由于各个人民公社都作了统筹安排，许多邻乡邻社的人们腾房子、扫院子、派车、派船、派代表，像欢迎亲人一样地接待这些迁居的社员，人们没有感到一点困难。都喜气洋洋地迅速安居乐业下来。这样的事是公社化以前无论如何做不到的。
    工程进行期间，各公社一方面把大批的最壮的劳动力抽出来调到密云，一方面加紧后方生产保证家乡全面跃进和大丰收。各公社都优先照顾民工家属，给民工照常记工分，冬天来了，公社给民工们送棉衣、手套，夏天来了公社又送来暑药和毛巾等，人民经过水库建设更热爱公社，因为热爱公社也就更加劲的建设公社。
    水库拦洪胜利，是党的领导胜利，总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利和人民公社的胜利！
