Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th - Jiangsu Province's coastal and riverside areas have seen 200,000 wind-powered water wheels playing a significant role in this year's rice irrigation and drought resistance efforts.

These 200,000 wind-powered water wheels have been gradually modified and newly built since the vigorous tool reform movement began last year. In terms of specifications and models, there are more than ten types, including self-steering, automatic sail-lowering, "omnidirectional wind," and universal windmills, as well as chain-pump windmills and simple windmills.

The irrigation efficiency of these improved windmills is very high. Generally, one windmill requires only one worker to manage it, and it can irrigate 20 to 30 mu of paddy fields per day and night, which is equivalent to the water-drawing efficiency of 16 to 25 strong laborers working day and night. Due to the full utilization of the efficiency of wind-powered water wheels, the province can save more than 4 million full laborers or more than 500,000 head of cattle for other production this year. This plays a significant role in alleviating the tight situation of rural labor and animal power and ensuring timely cultivation. In the fight against drought, these windmills have ensured the timely irrigation of 5 million mu of rice fields, and the large number of laborers saved have been used to strengthen field management, ensuring the normal growth of rice and other crops.

    利用风力车水抗旱
    江苏二十万部风力水车发挥作用
    新华社南京16日电　江苏省沿海沿江地带的二十万部风力水车，在今年水稻灌溉和抗旱斗争中发挥了很大作用。
    这二十万部风力水车是从去年大搞工具改革运动以来，逐步改制和新造的。在规格型号上，有自动转向、自动卸篷、“八面威风”和万能风车，以及练子风车和简易风车等十多种。
    这批改良风车的灌溉效率都很高，一般一部风车只要一个劳动力照顾，每昼夜就可以灌溉稻田二、三十亩，相当于十六个到二十五个强壮劳力一昼夜的车水功效。由于充分利用了风力水车的效能，今年全省可节省出四百多万个整劳力或五十多万条耕牛用于其他生产。这对于缓和农村人力畜力紧张情况，保证及时耕作，起着很大作用。在抗旱斗争中，这些风车保证了五百万亩水稻的及时灌溉，节省下来的大批劳力用来加强田间管理，保证了水稻和其他农作物的正常生长。
