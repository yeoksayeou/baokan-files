Editor's Note:

    The converter is a new force that has rapidly developed in China's steel industry during the Great Leap Forward. Since a large number of new converters have been put into battle, a new scene has appeared on China's steel front.

    Before the Great Leap Forward, who had ever heard of a province with a very weak industrial base being able to build 28 converters in less than four months? However, since the Great Leap Forward, miracles that people dared not imagine in the past have appeared on our steel front. The construction of converters in Anhui Province is such an example. During the Great Leap Forward, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held high the banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, concentrated manpower and necessary materials, and built many small blast furnaces in a very short period of time, mainly relying on its own strength. Now, this province has concentrated its efforts to build dozens of converters in a concentrated campaign. Without the Great Leap Forward, could you imagine today's situation?

    Newborn forces are always developing vigorously. Although right-leaning opportunists point fingers and deny the achievements of large-scale steel production, the existence of objective things cannot be erased.

    China's newly built converters have already undertaken a considerable steelmaking task this year, which is a major event. Right-leaning opportunists should be more sober-minded when they see the achievements of our converter construction!

    一支生力军
    转炉是我国钢铁工业大跃进中迅速发展起来的一支生力军，自从大批新转炉投入战斗以后，我国钢铁战线出现了新的景象。
    在大跃进以前，谁曾听说过一个工业基础非常薄弱的省份能够在四个月以内建成转炉二十八座？然而，大跃进以来，我们的钢铁战线上就出现了过去人们不敢想像的奇迹。安徽省的转炉建设就是如此。在大跃进中，中共安徽省委高举起总路线、大跃进的旗帜，集中了人力和必要的物资，在很短的时间内主要依靠自己的力量建成许多小高炉。现在，这个省又集中力量突击建成了几十座转炉。如果没有大跃进，你能设想会有今天的形势吗？
    新生力量总是蓬勃地向前发展的。尽管右倾机会主义分子指手划脚否认大办钢铁的成就，然而，客观事物的存在却是无法抹煞的。
    我国新建的转炉已经在今年担负了相当大的炼钢任务，这是一件大事。右倾机会主义分子看看我们转炉建设的成就，头脑该会清醒一些吧！
