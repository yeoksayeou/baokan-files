Product quality and labor productivity are also continuously improving.

Since August, workers in various regions and enterprises in Heilongjiang Province have extensively and deeply carried out socialist competitions, establishing pacesetters in every sector and at every level, forming a wave of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced. The 441 advanced factories in Harbin City all completed their third-quarter production plans more than ten days ahead of schedule. In August, workers in Jiamusi City proposed 9,093 rationalization proposals, of which 6,555 have been implemented, which can increase production value by 1.59 million yuan and save 170,000 yuan for the country annually.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, September 29th: After completing the September steel production plan thirteen days ahead of schedule, the steel industry workers in Guizhou Province completed the province's leap forward plan for 5,000 tons of steel in September ahead of schedule on the 21st; the qualified rate of steel reached more than 90%.

Workers in machinery, coal, chemical, light industry, construction, and other departments are equally spirited and high in morale. Workers in the coal industry system are actively summarizing and promoting advanced experiences to ensure the completion of the annual production task half a month ahead of schedule.

    据新华社哈尔滨29日电　黑龙江省已提前八天完成了第三季度的工业总产值计划。全省水泥、生铁、焦炭、电站锅炉、水轮发电机、汽轮发电机、金属切削机床、货车、轴承、纸、轮胎和乳制品等二十八种主要产品，都超额百分之一到百分之九十以上完成了9月份和第三季度计划。产品质量和劳动生产率也不断提高。
    8月份以来，黑龙江省各地各企业的职工广泛深入地开展了社会主义竞赛，行行树标兵，层层树标兵形成了学先进、赶先进、超过先进的热潮。哈尔滨市的四百四十一个先进工厂都提前十天以上完成了第三季度生产计划。佳木斯市职工8月份提出合理化建议九千零九十三件，已实现了六千五百五十五件，全年因此可以为国家增产一百五十九万元，节约十七万元。
    据新华社贵阳29日电　贵州省钢铁工业职工继提前十三天完成9月份炼钢生产计划以后，又在21日提前超额完成了9月份全省产钢五千吨的跃进计划；钢的合格率达到90％以上。
    机械、煤炭、化工、轻工、建筑等部门的职工，同样精神焕发、斗志昂扬。煤炭工业系统的职工为了确保提前半月完成全年生产任务，正积极总结和推广先进经验。贵阳市轻工业和化学工业已分别提前十二天和两周，完成了第三季度的产值计划，产品质量大为提高。
