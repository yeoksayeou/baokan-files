(From our Tianjin dispatch on the 31st) In Hebei Province, whether in the mountains or on the plains, a scene of abundant harvest is everywhere. Among the more than 80 million mu of spring-sown crops in the province, the corn grows with many large cobs, already ripening; the spring millet and sorghum are full of milky grains, and are being "sun-dried"; the 14 million mu of cotton have dense branches, short nodes, and many bolls; each spring sweet potato plant has grown into tubers of about half a catty. Summer-sown crops are now flowering, filling, and setting seeds, and rice is budding and heading; the seedling growth also exceeds that of previous years. The people's communes in various places are giving full play to the superiority of their large-scale organization, and, in the spirit of striving for the best and striving for overproduction, are rationally arranging labor and continuing to strengthen the later-stage management of crops, further deepening the overproduction movement, and striving to increase grain yield and weight, and to increase cotton bolls and quality.

At present, the labor force participating in various field management tasks throughout the province has increased from 10 million a month ago to more than 12.5 million. In the Tangshan area, 145 people's communes have launched red flag competitions and pacesetter competitions, and the attendance rate of commune members has increased from about 80% to more than 95%. Under the slogan of "Grain not in the granary means management doesn't stop, strive for overproduction by 10-20%", the people's communes in various places are actively processing and fertilizing crops. According to statistics as of August 20, spring-sown crops throughout the province have been hoed one or two more times, and summer-sown crops have also been cultivated, weeded, and earthed up in a timely manner. The 80 million mu of spring-sown crops throughout the province have basically been replenished with fertilizer; the topdressing area of summer-sown crops has also reached more than one-third. After the summer management centered on accumulating and applying fertilizer, the situation of fertilizer shortage and abundant weeds caused by excessive rain has been reversed. In the overproduction movement, the people's communes in Hengshui County, based on the principle of equal value exchange, organized 36,000 laborers from 247 production teams to help 205 production teams with crash field management, achieving good crop growth in every team, and a general harvest is expected throughout the county. The people's communes in various places have demonstrated their unparalleled vitality in the struggle against severe drought, floods, and insect pests. During spring plowing and sowing, there was a general lack of rain throughout the province. The rainfall in April and the first and middle ten days of May was less than half of that in the drought-stricken 1958 during the same period. In the face of the severe drought, the people's communes in various places, under the unified leadership of the Party, organized an army of more than 9 million people to fight drought and sow, persisting in the drought resistance movement for three months. They drilled 60,000 mechanized wells, newly built and repaired more than 110,000 canals, expanded the irrigation area by more than 7.6 million mu, and used more than 10,000 water pumps and more than 500,000 water lifting tools. By adopting the methods of working day and night, keeping the wells running without stopping people, sowing as soon as the water was poured, and planting by carrying water, more than 10 million mu of dry land were sown in a timely manner.

After entering summer, many areas suffered from floods. Under the unified leadership of the commune, an army of 180,000 people was immediately organized to drain the flood, unified planning and unified action were taken to overcome the contradictions between the upper and lower reaches, so that the serious disasters were reduced, the major disasters were turned into minor disasters, and the light disasters did not reduce production. According to current statistics, of the 10 million mu of flooded cultivated land in the province, nearly 6 million mu of accumulated water were drained in less than a month after the people's communes in various places launched a drainage and flood resistance struggle. The speed of drainage and the speed of recovery from the waterlogging are unprecedented in previous years.

The Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and the people's commune system have not only exerted great power in the struggle to seize disasters and protect production, but also brought unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the reform of the agricultural production system and the production management of crops. In this year's agricultural increase, the people's communes in various places have used the favorable conditions of a large population and strong leadership to carry out a large-scale, high-yield movement. Each commune, with the production team as the unit or the joint operation of each production team, cultivated more than 10 million mu of large-scale, high-yield fields. Various places used the high-yield fields as models to fully implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. People's communes in Renqiu, Yanshan and other five counties used 285,000 mu of high-yield fields as demonstration fields, and held 36 on-site meetings, which promoted timely watering, weeding, and insect removal of all farmland. Because the people's communes reformed the farming system and production leadership, not only did many large areas of particularly good crops appear in Hebei Province this year, but also many large areas of insect-free and weed-free areas were created. All autumn crops in the province, except for a few severely affected areas, have achieved good growth in every piece of land, and a good harvest is expected in everything.

At present, the people's communes in various parts of Hebei Province are using the favorable conditions of the combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs to mobilize all aspects of strength on the basis of further carrying out the overproduction movement, to ensure timely harvesting and to achieve a bumper harvest. The farm tool factories of the people's communes are rushing to manufacture autumn harvest tools to support the autumn harvest. Fifty-nine people's communes in Cangxian, Zhangbei and other three counties have organized more than 10,000 blacksmiths and carpenters, and adopted the method of centralized production and segmented contracting, and stringing villages to repair and match, and produced and repaired more than 400,000 pieces of various harvesting and transportation tools in one month. The Tuchengzi People's Commune in Zhangbei County also added ten horse-drawn harvesters with public accumulation to replace labor harvesting. The commercial departments of the communes in Jinghai and Zhangbei counties, under the unified leadership of the county commercial bureau, also sent more than 100 purchasing personnel, and through on-the-spot organization of processing and purchasing from other places, they adjusted and supplied more than 360,000 pieces of harvesting and threshing tools such as sickles and wooden forks. The people's communes in various places have also organized autumn protection teams and autumn picking teams with militia, schools and other organizations as the backbone.

Due to the implementation of the Party's General Line, boosting soaring enthusiasm, giving play to the superior conditions of the large population and great strength of the people's communes, strengthening the arrangement of later-stage management and autumn harvest work, and ensuring that this year's autumn harvest work is meticulous and timely. Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou and Tianjin counties have harvested more than 500,000 mu of early autumn crops in a timely manner. Chengguan Commune in Xinle County extracted 30,000 laborers to form specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, and threshing, with fixed division of labor and mutual cooperation. In seven days, they rushed to harvest 14,800 mu of corn in the rain, and achieved immediate harvesting, immediate harvesting, and immediate cultivation, and timely rushed to plant late vegetables and buckwheat.

    要粮食增粒棉花增桃
    河北千万农民奋战田间立志超产一二成
    本报天津31日电　河北省无论山川平原，到处是一片丰收景象。全省八千多万亩春播作物当中，玉米长的棒子又多又大，已经腊熟；春谷和高粱灌浆很饱，正在“晒米”；一千四百多万亩棉花，枝密、节短、桃多；春甘薯每棵已长成半斤左右的薯块。夏播作物正在扬花灌浆结籽，水稻正在打苞抽穗，苗景也超过往年。各地人民公社充分发挥组织规模大的优越性，本着力争上游、力争超产的精神，合理安排劳力，继续加强农作物的后期管理，进一步深入的开展超额增产运动，力争粮食增粒增重，棉花增桃增质量。
    目前全省参加各种田间管理的劳力，已由月前的一千万人增加到一千二百五十多万人。唐山专区一百四十五个人民公社展开红旗竞赛、标兵竞赛，社员的出勤率，由原来80％左右增加到95％以上。各地人民公社在“粮食不入仓，管理不休停，力争超产一两成”的口号鼓舞下，对农作物积极加工加肥。截至8月20日统计，全省春播作物又加锄了一两遍，夏播作物也适时进行了中耕锄草培土。全省八千万亩春播作物，基本上都补足了肥；夏播作物的追肥面积也达到了三分之一以上。经过以积肥追肥为中心的夏季管理，由多雨造成的缺肥多草的局面，已经扭转过来。衡水县各人民公社在超额增产运动中，根据等价交换的原则，组织二百四十七个生产队的三万六千多名劳力，帮助二百零五个生产队突击田间管理，达到了队队庄稼长得好，全县普遍可望丰收。各地人民公社在与严重的旱涝虫灾作斗争中，显示了无比旺盛的生命力。在春耕播种时，全省普遍缺雨。4月份和5月上中旬的降雨量，还不到干旱的1958年同期的一半。在严重的旱灾面前，各地人民公社在党的统一领导下，组织起九百多万人的抗旱播种大军，坚持了三个月的抗旱运动。锥打了六万眼机井，新修和修补了十一万多条渠道，扩大了灌溉面积七百六十多万亩，使用起一万多台抽水机、五十多万件提水工具。采用日夜鏖战，歇人不歇井、随浇随播种和挑水点种等办法，使一千多万亩失墒的土地适时播种。
    入夏以后，许多地区又发生了涝灾。在公社统一领导下，立即组织起十八万人的排涝大军，统一规划，统一行动，克服了上下游之间的矛盾，使重灾减轻、大灾化小、轻灾不减产。截至目前统计，全省一千万亩被淹耕地，经各地人民公社展开了排水抗涝斗争，不到一个月时间，即排除积水近六百万亩。排水之速，脱地之快，为历年所罕见。
    党的社会主义建设总路线和人民公社化，不仅在抢灾保产斗争中发挥出伟大力量，并给农业生产制度的改革和农作物的生产管理，带来了空前有利的条件。在今年农业增产当中，各地人民公社利用人多力量大、领导集中的有利条件，开展了大面积高额丰产运动。各社以生产队为单位或各生产队联合经营，培养了一千多万亩大面积高额丰产田。各地利用丰产田作样板，全面贯彻农业八字宪法。任丘、盐山等五县的人民公社以二十八万五千亩高额丰产田作示范田，召开了三十六次现场会，推动了所有农田适时浇水、锄草、除虫等田间管理。由于人民公社改革了耕作制度和生产领导，河北省今年不仅出现了许多大片的特好庄稼，并且创造了许多大片的无虫区和无草区。全省的秋庄稼，除少数重灾区外，达到块块生长好，样样望丰收。
    目前，河北省各地的人民公社正在运用工农商学兵相结合的有利条件，在进一步开展超额增产运动的基础上，动员各方面的力量，保证适时收打，作到丰产丰收。各人民公社的农具厂，正在赶制秋收工具，支援秋收。沧县、张北等三县五十九个人民公社，已组织起铁、木匠一万多人，采用集中生产和分片包干，串村修配的办法，在一个月里，即生产和修理各种收割运输工具四十多万件。张北县土城子人民公社还以公共积累添买了十台马拉收割机，代替劳力收割。静海和张北两县各公社的商业部门，也在县商业局的统一领导下，派出一百多名采购人员，经过就地组织加工和外地采购，调剂供应了镰刀木杈等收割打场工具三十六万多件。各地人民公社还以民兵、学校等组织为骨干，组织了护秋队和拾秋队。
    由于贯彻了党的总路线，鼓起冲天干劲，发挥了人民公社人多力量大的优越条件，加强后期管理和秋收工作的安排，保证今年秋收工作精细适时。石家庄、张家口地区和天津各县，已适时收割了早秋作物五十余万亩。新乐县城关公社抽出三万名劳力，组成收割、运输、打场等专业队，固定分工，互相配合，七天中冒雨抢收了玉米一万四千八百亩，并且做到了随收随割随耕地，及时抢种上晚菜、荞麦。（附图片）
