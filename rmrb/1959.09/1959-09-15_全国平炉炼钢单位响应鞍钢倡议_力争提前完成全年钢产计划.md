Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 14th—Representatives from national open-hearth steelmaking units attending the National Open-Hearth Production Technology Conference enthusiastically responded to the initiative of Anshan Iron and Steel workers to fulfill the year's steel production plan ahead of schedule, and issued a proposal to open-hearth workers nationwide.

The proposal stated: We have studied and formulated open-hearth steel production increase measures for the next four months, and believe it is possible to complete this year's open-hearth steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule. We enthusiastically respond to the initiative of Anshan Iron and Steel workers to complete the year's steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule, and call on all workers on the open-hearth front to go all out, work hard, work practically, and work cleverly, to advance bravely towards completing this year's plan ten days ahead of schedule, and towards completing the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year.

The proposal stated: We believe that the mass technical performance competitions widely carried out in various plants of Anshan Iron and Steel are a good way to launch mass movements in industry, to improve workers' ideological and technical levels, strengthen enterprise management, and carry out large-scale collaboration. Conscientiously implementing this experience will greatly improve the existing production level. To this end, we suggest immediately organizing learning and promotion in open-hearth steel plants across the country, pushing the mass production upsurge to a higher stage, thereby smelting more and better open-hearth steel, and offering gifts to the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    全国平炉炼钢单位响应鞍钢倡议
    力争提前完成全年钢产计划
    新华社鞍山14日电　参加全国平炉生产技术会议的全国各平炉炼钢单位的代表，热烈响应鞍钢职工提出的提前完成全年产钢计划的倡议，并且向全国平炉职工发出了倡议书。
    倡议书说：我们研究、制定了今后4个月的平炉钢增产措施，认为有可能提前十天完成今年平炉钢的生产计划。我们热烈响应鞍钢职工提出的提前十天完成全年产钢计划的倡议，并且号召全体平炉战线上的职工鼓足干劲，实干、苦干、巧干，为提前十天完成今年计划，为提前在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋勇前进。
    倡议书说：我们认为，鞍钢各厂所普遍开展的群众性的技术表演竞赛，是在工业中大搞群众运动的一种好形式，是提高工人思想水平和技术水平，加强企业管理，开展大协作的好方法。认真推行这个经验，就将把现有生产水平大大提高一步。为此，我们建议在全国各平炉钢厂立即组织学习和推广，把群众性的生产高潮推向更高阶段，从而冶炼出更多更好的平炉钢，向伟大的国庆十周年献礼。
