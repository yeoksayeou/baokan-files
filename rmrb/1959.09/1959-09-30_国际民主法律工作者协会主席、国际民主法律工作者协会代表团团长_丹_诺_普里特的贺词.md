Dear Friends,

I am speaking as President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. I and all my fellow delegates are very pleased and honored to have been invited to attend such a grand celebration of ten years of unprecedented human progress in history. We are particularly pleased to be guests of the China Political Science and Law Association, a highly respected branch of our association, and a very important part of our Association of Democratic Lawyers since its inception. We are the only truly international federation of lawyers in the world, because we have branches or other connections on every continent and in almost every important country; our connections on the vast and populous continent of Asia are naturally particularly valuable to us.

I believe you give us such honor because you notice the role we have played since our establishment fifteen years ago; because during this period, we have done our best to promote the cause of true justice, which has naturally been supported by the People's Republic of China. We know we still have shortcomings, and we will strive to overcome them. We have always done our best to support, and will continue to support, the cause of justice. Let me give a few examples: in articles in our publications, in special statements, in pamphlets, protests or resolutions, we have:

    Declared and supported the legitimate status of Taiwan as an integral part of China, against many distortions and provocations from the outside world;
    Exposed the attempts of some people to illegally deprive the People's Republic of China of its international legal right to send representatives to participate in the United Nations;
    Supported the Tibetan people in obtaining true democratic freedom, while outside hypocrites, while verbally talking about "democracy," have always supported a feudal regime based on enslavement, oppression, and torture, and even demanded "independence" for Tibet, that is, demanded that Tibet continue to serve as a Western puppet in order to better maintain its brutal feudal rule;
    Exposed the United States' use of bacteriological warfare in its war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and pointed out the illegality of bacteriological warfare;
    Exposed the illegality of nuclear weapons.

In terms of democratic freedom and human rights, we have always been at the forefront of struggles such as the defense of Glezos. We believe that we can say that we played a major role in at least saving him from execution. We have been exposing and attacking colonialism in its many manifestations around the world by all possible means, and exposing and attacking the trampling and deprivation of all basic human rights that it entails. In these and other issues, we have been working for the cause of peace. Peace has increasingly become a condition for maintaining all human rights and survival. Our motto is: "Law serves peace."

Therefore, we can say that we have taken the lead in playing the role that lawyers should play in all the struggles that the People's Republic of China has endorsed and supported. This is natural, because we are democratic lawyers, and you are a truly democratic country. We are very grateful for your deep friendship to us, and at the same time we venture to think that we are not completely unworthy of it. We will continue to walk our path.

Now let me talk about your achievements in law and the rule of law. We have watched with admiration how, while achieving the great achievements in economy, industry, agriculture and culture - these achievements have been justly praised in many speeches here - you have steadily established a truly democratic country under the rule of law. You inherited a country devastated by war, in which independence and democracy, especially the rule of law, had been destroyed by imperialism with its "Open Door" policy, extraterritoriality, tariff control, and countless other means of colonial oppression. You have rapidly established a truly rule-of-law and democratic country on this ruin. In stark contrast to the rulers of Kenya, Algeria and other such countries, you have raised the ethnic minorities - even the most backward ethnic minorities - in your country to a position of true equality and cooperation in the Great Leap Forward. You have achieved true and effective equality between men and women, which is in stark contrast to the subordinate status of women under feudalism and their de facto inferior status under capitalism. I cannot give more, even exciting, examples. In short, you have upheld every true democratic freedom and human right, and established a socialist rule-of-law country. Therefore, we are your friends, just as you have shown yourselves to be our friends; we are proud to be able to be your friends, and we are proud because you are our friends. We are proud to be respected by you, and we are proud to support your just actions everywhere.

In the fifteen years since our establishment, we have realized that legal workers, especially legal workers in socialist countries, but also legal workers in capitalist countries, can play a progressive role. You have helped us realize this. We are all at a very great moment in world history, at which we can play a progressive role. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China have shown how high man can reach, and how quickly he can reach this height; law is more clearly than ever a part of life and a part of politics. Legal workers can also contribute to mankind, to democracy, to freedom, and to peace.

Long live the People's Republic of China and the socialist rule of law it has established!
Long live the progressive role of legal workers in the modern world!
Long live peace!

### 国际民主法律工作者协会主席、国际民主法律工作者协会代表团团长  丹·诺·普里特的贺词

    国际民主法律工作者协会主席、国际民主法律工作者协会代表团团长
    丹·诺·普里特的贺词亲爱的朋友们：
    我是以国际民主法律工作者协会主席的身份讲话的。我个人以及我所有的同行代表们将以被邀请前来参加这样一个庆祝历史上空前的人类十年进步的盛典，感到很大的愉快和荣幸。我们特别感到愉快的是，我们还是中国政治法律协会的客人，这个协会是我们的一个很受尊重的分会，自从它加入以来一直是我们民主法律工作者协会的一个非常重要的组成部分。我们是世界上唯一真正的国际律师联合会，因为我们在每一个大陆上，在几乎每一个重要的国家里都有分会或者其他的联系；我们在巨大而人口众多的亚洲大陆上的联系自然对我们特别可贵。
    我认为你们给予我们这样的荣誉是由于你们注意到我们成立十五年以来所发挥的作用；因为在这一段时期里，我们尽最大的力量推进了真正正义的事业，这自然是得到中华人民共和国的支持的。我们知道我们还有缺点，我们将努力加以克服。我们向来就是尽最大的力量支持、并且将继续支持正义的事业。让我来举几个例子：在我们的刊物的文章中，在特别声明中，在小册子、抗议书或决议中，我们曾经：
    声明并支持台湾作为中国的一个组成部分的正当地位，反对外界的许多歪曲和挑衅；
    揭露某些人们企图非法剥夺中华人民共和国派代表参加联合国组织的国际法权利；
    支持西藏人民得到真正的民主自由，而外界的伪君子们虽然口头上讲“民主”，却一直支持一个以奴役、压迫和酷刑为基础的封建政权，甚至要求西藏“独立”，即要求西藏继续充当西方的傀儡，以便更好地保持它的残酷的封建统治；
    揭露美国在侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争中进行细菌战，并指出细菌战的非法性；
    揭露核武器的非法性。
    在民主自由和人权方面，我们一直站在像为格列索斯辩护这样的斗争的前列。我们认为，我们可以说在至少使他免被处决方面起了很大作用。我们一直在用一切可能的办法揭露和攻击殖民主义在世界各地的许多表现、揭露和攻击它所意味着的蹂躏和剥夺一切基本人权的行为。在这些以及在其他问题上，我们一直为和平事业而努力。和平已经愈来愈成为维护一切人权和生存的条件。我们的座右铭就是：“法律为和平服务”。
    因此，我们可以说，我们在为中华人民共和国所赞同和支持的一切斗争中带头发挥了律师们应发挥的作用。这是很自然的，因为我们是民主律师，你们是一个真正的民主国家。我们很感谢你们对我们的深情厚谊，同时我们也冒昧地认为，我们也不是完全受之有愧的。我们将继续走我们的道路。
    现在让我来谈谈你们在法律和法治方面的功绩。我们以钦佩不已的心情注视着，你们如何在经济、工业、农业和文化方面取得的伟大成就——这些成就已经在这里的许多讲话中得到了公正的赞扬——的同时，稳步地建立了一个真正的民主法治国家。你们继承的是一个受到战争破坏的国家，在这个国家里，独立和民主尤其是法治已经被帝国主义用它的“门户开放”政策、治外法权、关税控制和其他无数殖民压迫手段所摧毁了。你们在这废墟上迅速地建立了一个真正法治和民主的国家。与怯尼亚、阿尔及利亚和其他这类国家的统治者截然相反，你们把你们国家的少数民族——甚至最落后的少数民族在大跃进中提高到真正平等和合作的地位。你们实现了真正的、有效的男女平等，这与妇女在封建制度下的从属地位和她们在资本主义制度下的事实上低人一等的地位适成对照。我不能多举甚至是激动人心的例子了。总之，你们维护了每一种真正的民主自由和人权，建立了一个社会主义法治的国家。因此，我们是你们的朋友，就像你们已表明是我们的朋友那样；我们以能够做你们的朋友而感到自豪，并且因为你们是我们的朋友而感到自豪。我们因为能得到你们的尊重而感到自豪，并且因为支持你们在各处的正义行动而感到自豪。
    我们在成立以来的十五年中，认识到法律工作者，特别是社会主义国家的法律工作者，同时也有资本主义国家的法律工作者，能够发挥进步的作用。你们帮助我们认识了这一点。我们都处在世界历史上的一个非常伟大的时刻，在这个时刻我们可以发挥进步的作用。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国已经表明人可以达到什么样的高度，以及他能够多么迅速地达到这种高度；法律比以往任何时候更加明显地成了生活的一部分和政治的一部分。法律工作者也能够对人类、对民主、对自由、对和平作出贡献。
    中华人民共和国和它所建立的社会主义法治万岁！
    法律工作者在现代世界中的进步作用万岁！
    和平万岁！（附图片）
