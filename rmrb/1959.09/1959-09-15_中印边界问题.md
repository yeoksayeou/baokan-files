    The border between China and India is very long, mostly mountainous, and sparsely populated. It has never been precisely demarcated with the agreement of both sides, but this does not mean that there is no boundary. In fact, traditional understanding is still clearly in existence. Our country has always drawn the boundary on maps based on facts, and its location has been commonly accepted by the world. Since India's independence, advocating peace and neutrality, and Premier Nehru and our Premier Zhou created the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, our country sincerely rejoices to have gained a major friendly country, breaking away from the previous atmosphere of British imperialism. Therefore, our people sincerely hope to send representatives to formally discuss and specifically demarcate this boundary with India, considering this the best opportunity for a friendly agreement.
    Unfortunately, recent Indian rhetoric has made this matter excessively tense. Instead of acknowledging that their own soldiers have crossed the border, they claim that China has militarily invaded India, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. We have absolutely no ambition to encroach upon Indian territory, or any other country’s territory for that matter. This is the basic policy of a socialist country, and it is entirely reliable. We also believe that India should respect China's territory in order to maintain true Sino-Indian friendship. The difficulty is that Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Indian parliament that China must recognize the so-called McMahon Line as valid. It seems that only under this recognition can he negotiate specific and partial discrepancies. Our government has already stated that the McMahon Line was a conspiracy of former British imperialism, and our government has never recognized it, nor can it recognize it now. Therefore, whether the McMahon Line is valid has become a key issue.
    I am not an expert on national boundaries, but I have paid considerable attention to important boundaries. I remember in 1933, I participated in editing a Chinese map for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Shenbao newspaper. The boundary between China and India, east of Bhutan, was drawn on the map according to the commonly recognized position. At that time, I did not feel that there would be any problem with this position. Even many British-made maps in the past basically accepted this position. Today, I have in my possession the sixth edition of the Oxford Advanced Atlas, published by Oxford University Press in 1940. The northeastern border of India on the map basically accepts this standard, and the McMahon Line does not exist. The McMahon Line was secretly proposed by the British representative at the Simla Conference in 1914. The Chinese government has never recognized it, so it was not established. The fact that past British maps did not draw this line proves that the British public originally knew that the McMahon Line had not obtained valid international status.
    Our country's attitude towards India is clearly peaceful and friendly. We cannot accept the McMahon Line out of thin air, and in fact, our military has never, and does not now, cross this line. We ask India to jointly respect the customary scope before an agreement is reached. I think, if the Indian people appreciate our friendly intentions, they will surely understand that our country, in addition to protecting its own territory, sincerely respects India. Therefore, India should also adopt the same reasonable attitude to ease the current unnecessary tension.

    中印边界问题
    翁文灏
    中国和印度的边界是很长的，地多山岭，人口稀少，向来没有经过双方同意的精确划定，但这不是说没有疆界，实际上传统的认识还是明白存在的。我国对于这个边界，向来依据事实，在地图上绘出界线，其位置为世界所共同接受。自从印度独立，主张和平中立，尼赫鲁总理同我国周总理创建和平共处五项原则，我国衷心欣幸得到了一个重大友邦，脱离了已往英帝国主义的气氛，因之，我国人民衷诚希望同印度正式派员商谈和具体划定这个界线，认为这是最好的友谊协定的机会。
    不幸的是，近来印度的言论把这件事弄得过分紧张。他们不说自身军人超越界线，反说我国武力侵略印度，这与事实完全不符。我们对于印度领土和任何别的国家一样，决没有任何侵占的野心，这是社会主义国家的基本方针，十分可靠；我们也觉得印度应当尊重我国领土，以保持中印的真正友谊。目前比较感觉为难的是，尼赫鲁总理在印度议会提出他所谓麦克马洪线，中国必须认为有效，好像只有在这个认识下，他才可以商洽具体和局部的出入。我国政府已经声明，麦克马洪线是从前英帝国主义的阴谋，我国政府从来没有承认，现在也不能承认。因此麦克马洪线是否有效，成为一个关键问题。
    我不是研究国界的专家，但对于重要界线也曾相当注意。记得当1933年，我曾参加为申报馆成立六十周年编辑中国地图，把不丹以东，中国和印度之间的界线，依照大家所共认的地位绘在图上。那时我丝毫不觉得这个位置会有任何问题，连已往好些英国所制的地图都基本上接受这个位置的。今天我手头有一本1940年牛津大学出版社印行的牛津增订图集第六版印度图，图上所载印度东北边界基本上还是接受这个标准，并没有麦克马洪线存在。麦克马洪线是在1914年西姆拉会议中由英方代表秘密提出的，中国政府从来没有承认，所以并未成立。已往英国地图都不绘这线，正可证明英国公众原来也知道麦克马洪线没有取得国际上有效的地位。
    我国对印度的态度显然是和平而友好的；我们不可能凭空接受麦克马洪线，而事实上我国武力从来不，现在也不，超过这条线；我们要求印度在没有达成协定以前，双方共同尊重习惯的范围；我想，印度人民如果体会到我国的友好用意，也必会了解到我国除保护本国领土外，对印度方面诚意尊重，因之印度也应当采取同样的合理态度，来和缓目前非必要的紧张形势。
