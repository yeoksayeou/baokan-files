Introduction to the Miyun Reservoir Project

Miyun Reservoir, the largest comprehensive water conservancy project in North China, has successfully controlled floodwaters.

Miyun Reservoir is located north of Miyun County in Beijing. The reservoir area spans the Chao and Bai Rivers, covering an area of 200 square kilometers, equivalent to 100 Kunming Lakes in the Summer Palace. After completion, the reservoir will have a storage capacity of 4.1 billion cubic meters, 60 times more than the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir.

The project involves a large amount of work. The main projects include: two main dams, seventeen auxiliary dams, a spillway, and an emergency spillway. A power station with an installed capacity of 60,000 kilowatts and an average annual power generation of 110 million kilowatt-hours is being built on the Bai River. The total project volume requires excavating and filling 37 million cubic meters of earth and stone.

The Bai River Dam and the Chao River Dam are the two main dams of the Miyun Reservoir. The Bai River Dam is 66 meters high and 957.5 meters long at the crest; the Chao River Dam is 56 meters high and 1,008 meters long at the crest. The seventeen auxiliary dams built around these two main dams are all over 30 meters high.

The average annual rainfall in the Chao and Bai River basins is 500 to 600 millimeters, with 60% concentrated in July and August. The rainfall pattern in this area is also of the heavy rain type, so floods have occurred frequently throughout history. In the 41 years of hydrological records, the flood peaks in 1939 and 1949 were the largest, with flows of 5,590 and 5,160 cubic meters per second respectively, rushing downstream. People living in the Chao and Bai River basins have suffered from the disasters of these two rivers for generations. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the people downstream carried out river dredging, embankment reinforcement, and emergency repairs of dangerous works, which greatly reduced the disasters, but the water problems were still not completely solved. According to statistics from 1949 to 1956, more than 33 million mu of land in Shunyi, Tongzhou, Baodi and other counties (districts) downstream of the Chao and Bai Rivers were affected by floods in eight years. After the completion of the Miyun Reservoir, the water problems in the Chao and Bai River basins can be completely eliminated. In early August of this year, a flood peak came from the upper reaches of the reservoir, with a flow of 3,100 cubic meters per second. However, because the earth dam of the reservoir had been built to the flood control elevation, only 400 cubic meters per second were discharged downstream through the spillway structures. This flood control alone saved more than 4 million mu of farmland downstream from disaster. The areas along the Chao and Bai Rivers, including Tongzhou, Shunyi, Jixian, Wuqing, and Baodi counties, not only preserved the crops along the banks, but also reduced the disaster of waterlogging because the water level of the Chao and Bai Rivers was low, allowing internal water to be discharged.

After the completion of the Miyun Reservoir, it can also turn water disasters into water benefits. More than 40,000 mu of dry land downstream of the Chao and Bai Rivers will be turned into paddy fields. Nearly one million mu of river beaches and low-lying areas will be turned into fertile land. At the same time, fruit trees can be widely planted along both sides of the river to beautify the motherland's mountains and rivers and regulate the climate. Due to the rapid development of industry in Beijing and Tianjin, the water situation is relatively tight. After the completion of the reservoir, the net regulated flow is 25.7 cubic meters per second under particularly dry conditions, which can supply 20.7 cubic meters per second for Beijing and Tianjin. This will ensure the industrial water needs of Beijing and Tianjin.

Among the various beneficial undertakings of the reservoir, hydropower generation is also an important part. The designed capacity of the power station is 60,000 kilowatts, with an average annual power generation of 110 million kilowatt-hours. After the completion of the reservoir, fish farming and duck raising can also be developed. (Attached pictures)

    密云水库工程介绍
    华北最大的综合性水利工程——密云水库，已经胜利拦洪。
    密云水库位于北京市密云县城以北，库区跨越潮、白两河，水库面积为二百平方公里，相当于一百个颐和园的昆明湖。水库建成后，蓄水量为四十一亿立方米，比十三陵水库多蓄水六十倍。
    水库的工程量很大，主要工程有：两座主坝，十七个副坝，溢洪道和非常溢洪道。在白河修建一座装机容量六万瓩、每年平均发电量为一点一亿度的发电站。水库全部工程量共需开挖、填筑土石方三千七百万方。
    白河大坝和潮河大坝是密云水库的两个主坝。白河水坝高六十六米，坝顶全长九百五十七点五米；潮河大坝高五十六米，坝顶全长一千零八米。围绕这两个主坝修建的十七个副坝，高度都在三十米以上。
    潮、白河流域年平均雨量为五百至六百毫米，其中60％集中在7、8两月，这个地区的雨型又为暴雨型式，因此历年洪水泛滥成灾。在四十一年的水文纪录中，1939年和1949年的洪峰最大，它以每秒五千五百九十和五千一百六十秒立方米的流量冲向下游，居住在潮、白河流域的人们，世世代代受尽了这两条河的灾害。解放后，下游人民在党和人民政府的领导下，进行了疏通河道、加固堤岸、抢修险工等治理工作，灾害虽然大大减轻了，但水患仍未得到根治。据1949年到1956年的统计，八年中，潮白河下游顺义、通州、宝坻等县（区），受洪水危害的土地达三千三百多万亩。密云水库建成后，就能根除潮白河流域的水患。今年8月上旬，水库上游来了一次洪峰，流量达三千一百秒立方米，但因水库土坝已筑到拦洪高程，经过泄水建筑物只向下游泄出四百秒立方米。仅这次拦洪结果，就使水库下游约有四百万亩以上农田免除灾害。潮白河沿岸的通州、顺义、蓟县、武清、宝坻等县区一带，不但保全了沿岸的庄稼，而且由于潮白河水位低，内水得以排出，减轻了内涝的灾害。
    密云水库建成后，还能变水害为水利。潮白河下游四万亩以上的旱地将要变成水地。近百万亩河滩、洼地将变成良田。同时在沿河两岸，可以广植果木树，美化祖国山川，调节气候。由于京津两地工业迅速发展，用水情况比较紧张。水库建成后，在特别干旱的情况下，净调节流量为二十五点七秒立方米，可供京津两地用水二十点七秒立方米。这样就能保证京津两地工业用水需要。
    在水库各项兴利事业中，水力发电也是一项重要的内容。发电站的设计能力为六万瓩，每年平均发电量为一亿一千万度。水库建成后还可以发展养鱼养鸭等事业。（附图片）
