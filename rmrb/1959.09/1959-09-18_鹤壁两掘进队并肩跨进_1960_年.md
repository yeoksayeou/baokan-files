Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Electric Dispatch: Two competing teams from the Hebi Coal Mine – the Qi Hezhi and Guan Dexi youth rapid excavation teams (groups) – have both exceeded their annual work quotas ahead of schedule, striding forward together into 1960.

From January to September 10th this year, the Qi Hezhi youth rapid excavation team excavated a total of 4,394 meters, exceeding the plan by 21.61%. From January to September 10th this year, the Guan Dexi youth rapid excavation group excavated a total of 5,142 meters, exceeding the plan by 9.4%.

After earnestly summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, these two excavation teams (groups) have more firmly implemented the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and have continuously waged struggles against right-leaning conservative thinking. At the beginning of this year, a few people said, "It will not be as easy to have another leap forward this year as it was last year; the potential is not as great." At this time, the Qi Hezhi and Guan Dexi excavation teams (groups) used their continued leap forward achievements to shatter this erroneous thinking. In January of this year, Qi Hezhi exceeded the state plan for January by 18.4% and created a new record of advancing 18.8 meters per day. The Hebi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League held an on-site meeting at the Qi Hezhi excavation team and issued a call to fight a great battle in 1959 and launch a red flag competition; subsequently, a new situation of leaping forward emerged throughout the city, with everyone chasing and surpassing each other, and frequent good news. On February 17th, the Qi Hezhi excavation team once again took the lead, creating a new record of advancing 42 meters per day. On March 7th, the Guan Dexi excavation group created a new record of advancing 46 meters per day, quickly surpassing the Qi Hezhi excavation team. Immediately afterward, the Qi Hezhi excavation team ran ahead again with a daily advance of 48 meters. In this way, the competition rose wave upon wave, peak after peak.

In May of this year, some people expressed doubts about the planned targets of the Qi Hezhi and Guan Dexi excavation teams (groups). However, with the support of the higher-level Party committee and the Communist Youth League, they not only did not lose heart, but instead became more motivated. After calculating carefully and fully estimating the objective favorable conditions, they not only did not lower the original planned targets, but also increased them by 400 meters on the original basis. Afterward, their excavation efficiency continued to rise step by step, and the excavation plan was exceeded month after month. On August 24th and 26th, they successively completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

    鹤壁两掘进队并肩跨进1960年
    新华社郑州电　鹤壁煤矿的两个竞赛对手——齐合只和关德喜两个青年快速掘进队（组），都提前超额完成了今年的工作量，昂首阔步，一同跨进1960年。
    齐合只青年快速掘进队从今年1月到9月10日，共掘进了四千三百九十四米，比计划超额21.61％。关德喜青年快速掘进组从今年1月到9月10日，共掘进了五千一百四十二米，比计划超额9.4％。
    这两个掘进队（组），在今年春天认真地总结了去年大跃进的经验以后，更加坚定地贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，不断地同右倾保守思想开展了斗争。今年初，有少数人说：“今年再搞跃进就没有去年条件好了，潜力不大了”。这时，齐合只和关德喜两个掘进队（组），就以继续跃进的成绩，来打破这种错误思想。今年1月份，齐合只超额18.4％完成了1月份的国家计划，并且创造了日进十八点八米的新纪录。中共鹤壁市委和共青团市委，在齐合只掘进队召开了现场会议，发出了大战1959年、开展红旗竞赛的号召；随后，全市就出现了你追我赶、捷报频传的跃进新局面。2月17日，齐合只掘进队又一马当先，创造了日进四十二米的新纪录。3月7日，关德喜掘进组创造日进四十六米的新纪录，迅速地超过了齐合只掘进队。紧接着，齐合只掘进队又以日进四十八米跑在前面。就这样，一浪高过一浪、一峰高过一峰地竞赛起来。
    今年5月，有些人对齐合只、关德喜两个掘进队（组）的计划指标，表示怀疑。但是，他们在上级党委和团委的支持下，不仅没有灰心，反而干劲更足了。经过算细账，充分估计客观的有利条件以后，不仅没有降低原来的计划指标，并且在原有的基础上又增加四百米。以后，他们的掘进效率仍然步步上升，掘进计划还是月月超额完成。到8月24日和26日，他们先后提前完成了全年计划。
