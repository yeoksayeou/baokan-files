    On Pressure
    Gong Tongwen

    Air has pressure, and water also has pressure. The rarer the air, the smaller the pressure; the deeper the water, the greater the pressure. Strong winds and heavy rains, severe cold and scorching heat, are also a kind of pressure on people. Human production and development are first and foremost the result of struggling against the various pressures of nature. If humanity cannot resist (adaptation is also a kind of resistance) the pressures of the natural world, it cannot survive. Since the slave society, human society has been divided into the oppressing and exploiting classes and the oppressed and exploited classes. Slave owners exert pressure on slaves, landlords exert pressure on peasants, and capitalists exert pressure on workers. And the resistance of slaves, peasants, and workers is a counter-pressure against slave owners, landlords, and capitalists. In countries where the socialist revolution has triumphed, the working class has become the ruling class. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a pressure on all the overthrown exploiting classes. And the resistance of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, as well as the bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie, against the socialist revolution is a counter-pressure against the proletariat. The world today is divided into two major camps: on the one hand, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, the imperialist camp headed by the United States. These two major camps struggle against each other and exert pressure on each other. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind."

    Without pressure, there would be no contradiction, no struggle, no movement, no development, no everything. The question is from what standpoint and towards what object pressure is applied. Our country is in a period of transition to socialism. Either the proletariat and socialism overwhelm the bourgeoisie and capitalism, or the bourgeoisie and capitalism overwhelm the proletariat and socialism. This is a life-and-death决斗 (jue dou - decisive battle). Isn't that so?

    For our comrades within the Party, in addition to the reflection of the struggle between the two roads within the Party, there is also a struggle between two lines. Either the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results overwhelms the bleak and dismal right-opportunist line, or the right-opportunist line overwhelms the Party's general line. To guarantee the Party's general line and to crush right-opportunism is the sacred duty of every person who is loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the cause of socialism.

    It is impossible for people to escape the pressure of the natural world; it is also impossible for people to escape the pressure of class struggle. We must resist the pressure of the natural world, transform nature, make mountains bow their heads and rivers give way, and make the natural world serve us. We must transform the world, eliminate the exploiting classes and the root cause of exploitation – the private ownership of the means of production – and build a paradise on earth – communism.

    Having said all of the above, am I shooting at random? No, this is to answer the accusations of some comrades against the author. Recently, I heard such a comment: Gong Tongwen's articles put pressure on people! In their view, articles must be like spring ice pops and soda, so that everyone who eats them feels cool and comfortable. If there is some spiciness or some sting, it is considered a sin. Is this kind of view Marxist? Although our style is not high, we would never dare to be "excessively modest" and can never agree with this view of not wanting "pressure." Several comrades from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee formed a writing group under the pen name Gong Tongwen. This started in the winter of 1955. Gong Tongwen fought against the right-leaning thinking in the agricultural cooperativization movement at that time, and then fought against the right-leaning conservative thinking in agricultural production. In the high tide of the rural socialist revolution and the high tide of agricultural production, Gong Tongwen was a propagandist and mobilizer, an ordinary soldier on the ideological and political front. After the autumn harvest of 1956 and in the spring of 1957, Gong Tongwen praised the victory of the Party and the people and opened fire on those who pointed fingers. In the spring of 1957, he also declared war on the bourgeois thinking of those who clamored for fame and status. In the anti-rightist struggle in the summer of 1957, Gong Tongwen stepped forward again. Since the winter of 1957, Gong Tongwen's main focus has been on right-leaning conservative thinking in socialist construction, and while praising the Great Leap Forward, he also criticized the bad tendencies of subjectivism and commandism. Gong Tongwen is a fighting group, a docile tool of the Party, a tool for fighting to defend the Party's general line, to defend the Party's unity, and to defend the interests of socialism. For right-leaning conservative thinking and for various bad tendencies that violate the interests of the Party, not only should pressure be applied, but also they should be crushed. Those who say that Gong Tongwen's articles have pressure are only half right. They should know that Gong Tongwen's articles are still not sharp enough, and the pressure is still not enough. We demand that our essays are not only like a sharp dagger, but also have the power of a string of cannons to crush bourgeois ideology and to crush right-opportunism! We must shrink the market for bourgeois ideology and right-opportunism smaller and smaller, so that bourgeois elements and right-opportunist elements feel that there is no way out except to bow their heads in surrender and obediently accept transformation.

    Pressure is objectively present. Either proletarian ideology overwhelms bourgeois ideology, or bourgeois ideology overwhelms proletarian ideology. Either the Party's general line overwhelms right-opportunism, or right-opportunism overwhelms the Party's general line. Either righteousness overwhelms evil, or evil overwhelms righteousness. Either correctness overwhelms error, or error overwhelms correctness. We must hold high the red flag of the general line, hold high the fighting weapon of Marxism-Leninism, and attack bourgeois ideology! Attack right-opportunism! Long live Marxism-Leninism! Long live the victory of the communist cause!

    论压力
    龚同文
    空气是有压力的，水也是有压力的。空气越稀压力越小，水越深压力越大。狂风暴雨，严寒酷热，对人也是一种压力。人类的生产和发展首先是和自然的种种压力作斗争的结果。人类如果不能抵抗（适应也是一种抵抗）自然界的压力是不能生存的。自从奴隶社会起，人类社会被划分为压迫、剥削阶级和被压迫、被剥削的阶级。奴隶主对奴隶，地主对农民，资本家对工人，是一种压力。而奴隶、农民、工人的反抗，又是对于奴隶主、地主、资本家的一种反压力。社会主义革命胜利了的国家，工人阶级变为统治阶级了。无产阶级专政是对于一切被打倒了的剥削阶级的压力。而地、富、反、坏、右以及资产阶级、上层小资产阶级对于社会主义革命的反抗，又是对于无产阶级的一种反压力。现今世界分成了两大阵营：一方面是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，一方面是以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，这两大阵营之间互相斗争、互相施加压力。毛泽东同志说过：现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。
    没有压力，就没有矛盾，没有斗争，没有运动，没有发展，没有一切。问题是站在什么立场向着什么对象施加压力。我们的国家处在建设社会主义的过渡时期。不是无产阶级、社会主义压倒资产阶级、资本主义，就是资产阶级、资本主义压倒无产阶级、社会主义，这是一场两条道路的生死的决斗。难道不是这样吗？
    对于我们党内的同志来说，除了两条道路之间的斗争在党内的反映以外，还有一个两条路线之间的斗争。不是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线压倒冷冷清清、凄凄惨惨的右倾机会主义路线，就是右倾机会主义压倒党的总路线。保证党的总路线，粉碎右倾机会主义，是每个忠于党、忠于人民、忠于社会主义事业的人的神圣职责。
    人要逃避自然界的压力是不可能的；人要逃避阶级斗争的压力也是不可能的。我们要反抗自然界的压力，要改造自然，要高山低头、河水让路，要自然界为我们服务。我们要改造世界，要消灭剥削阶级以及产生剥削的根源——生产资料的私有制，建设起人间的天堂——共产主义。
    说了上面这一大段话，我不是无的放矢？不，这是为了答复一部分同志对作者的指责。近来听到这样一种议论：龚同文的文章对人有压力！在他们看来，文章必须像春天的冰棒、汽水那样，不论什么人吃了都感到清凉舒服，如果其中有些辣味，有些刺，就算罪过。难道这种观点是马克思主义的吗？虽然我们风格不高，但是也决不敢“过分的谦虚”，决不能同意这种不要“压力”的观点。湖北省委机关若干同志成立了一个写作小组，笔名龚同文。这是从1955年冬季开始的。龚同文针对着当时农业合作化运动中的右倾思想进行斗争，然后又针对着农业生产中的右倾保守思想进行斗争。在农村社会主义革命高潮和农业生产高潮当中龚同文是宣传鼓动员，是思想政治战线上的普通一兵。1956年秋收以后和1957年春季，龚同文歌颂了党和人民的胜利，向那些指手划脚的人开了火。1957年春季又向那些闹名誉、闹地位的资产阶级思想宣战。在1957年夏季反右派的斗争当中，龚同文又出马了。1957年冬季以来，龚同文的主要锋芒是向着社会主义建设当中的右倾保守思想，在歌颂大跃进的同时，也批评了主观主义、命令主义的不良倾向。龚同文是一个战斗小组，是党的驯服工具，是为保卫党的总路线、保卫党的团结、保卫社会主义的利益而斗争的工具。对于右倾保守思想、对于违反党的利益的各种不良倾向，不仅要施加压力，而且要加以粉碎的。那些说龚同文的文章有压力的人只说对了一半。他们应当知道，龚同文的文章还是不够锋利的，压力还是不够的。我们要求自己写的杂文不仅像一把犀利的匕首，而且应当具有连珠炮那样的威力，来粉碎资产阶级思想，来粉碎右倾机会主义！把资产阶级思想和右倾机会主义的市场缩得小而又小，要使资产阶级分子和右倾机会主义分子感到除了低头投降，乖乖地接受改造以外，别无出路。
    压力是客观存在的。不是无产阶级思想压倒资产阶级思想，就是资产阶级思想压倒无产阶级思想。不是党的总路线压倒右倾机会主义，就是右倾机会主义压倒党的总路线。不是正气压倒邪气，就是邪气压倒正气。不是正确压倒错误，就是错误压倒正确。我们要高举总路线的红旗，高举马克思列宁主义的战斗武器，向资产阶级思想进攻！向右倾机会主义进攻！马克思列宁主义万岁！共产主义事业胜利万岁！
