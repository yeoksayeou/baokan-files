Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th – State-owned commercial employees in Jiangsu Province have opposed rightist tendencies and boosted morale. Since late August, they have launched a crash month procurement campaign for non-staple foods, which has resulted in a multiple increase in the procurement of pigs and poultry, and a relatively large increase in the procurement of aquatic products and eggs.

Now, many units across the province have exceeded their crash month procurement targets. In the Huaiyang Special District, a key producing area for livestock and poultry, some cadres in the commercial departments originally had varying degrees of rightist sentiments, emphasizing difficulties, resulting in slow procurement progress. After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, commercial employees throughout the district enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, putting forward the slogan "Oppose Rightism, Boost Morale, Strive for Advancement, Welcome National Day," and launching a vigorous mass movement, which brought a fresh atmosphere to the purchasing work. The entire special district overfulfilled the provincial crash month hog procurement plan by 72% in twenty days. The procurement volume in those twenty days increased nearly tenfold compared with July of this year, which already had relatively good procurement figures, making it an advanced area in the province's crash month non-staple food procurement campaign.

During the crash month non-staple food procurement campaign, Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over procurement work and conducted propaganda on "worker-peasant alliance" and "rural support for the cities" to cadres and members of communes and production teams. Commercial departments universally increased the number of procurement points, improved procurement methods, and made it convenient for the masses to sell non-staple foods. Jiangning County did a good job in propaganda, and the business departments adopted methods such as combining fixed-point procurement with door-to-door procurement to facilitate the masses. They also conscientiously implemented the policy of high quality and good prices. The masses enthusiastically sold their livestock and poultry to the state. The county completed its pig and beef cattle procurement plan for the third quarter ahead of schedule in late August.

    江苏超额完成突击月收购任务
    家畜家禽水产品蛋品收购量大增
    新华社南京24日电　江苏省国营商业职工反右倾，鼓干劲，从8月下旬起开展副食品突击收购月，使猪和家禽的收购量成倍地增加，水产品、蛋品的收购量也有较大幅度的增长。
    现在，全省已有很多单位超额完成了突击月的收购任务。家畜、家禽重点产地的淮阳专区，商业部门一部分干部原来存在程度不同的右倾情绪，强调困难，因此收购进度缓慢。在党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，全区商业职工热烈响应党的号召，提出
  “反右倾，鼓干劲，争上游，迎国庆”的口号，大搞群众运动，使采购工作气象一新。全专区以二十天时间就超额72％完成了省下达的突击月生猪收购计划，二十天的收购量比今年收购情况较好的7月份增加近十倍，成为全省副食品突击收购月运动中的先进地区。
    在副食品突击收购月运动中，各级党委加强了收购工作的领导，向公社、生产队的干部和社员进行了“工农联盟”、“农村支援城市”的宣传。商业部门普遍增设收购点，改进收购方法，便利群众出售副食品。江宁县宣传工作做得好，业务部门采取定点收购与上门收购相结合等方便群众的做法，并且认真贯彻优质优价政策，群众踊跃把家畜家禽卖给国家，全县在8月下旬就提前完成第三季度的猪和菜牛收购计划。
