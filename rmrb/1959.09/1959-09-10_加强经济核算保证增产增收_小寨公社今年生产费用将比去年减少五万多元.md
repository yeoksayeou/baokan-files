    Strengthen Economic Accounting to Guarantee Increased Production and Income
    Xiaozhai Commune's Production Costs This Year Will Be Reduced by More Than 50,000 Yuan Compared to Last Year

    (Our report) The Dongxing Production Team of the Xiaozhai Commune in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, strengthened its economic accounting work during the overproduction competition, vigorously reducing production costs and achieving greater production increases with less manpower, materials and financial resources.

    The growth of Dongxing Production Team's more than 1,600 mu of grain crops and more than 2,700 mu of cash crops have exceeded last year's. According to the recent joint yield assessment organized by the commune, the team's grain yield per mu is expected to increase by 55% compared to last year, and the cotton yield per mu will increase by 43% compared to last year. However, production costs are much lower than last year. The team's actual expenditure from January to July was 27,850 yuan, accounting for 66.7% of the planned cost. It is estimated that an additional 1,770 yuan will be needed for topdressing and watering in the later stage of the crops. The total actual cost per mu of land for the whole year is only 6.04 yuan, accounting for 71% of the annual cost plan, a reduction of more than 55,000 yuan compared to last year. Calculated based on the entire brigade of 1,461 people, this item alone will allow each person to earn more than 38 yuan.

    Cost accounting was proposed this spring when formulating the production plan. The Party Branch Committee planned to use cost accounting to ensure that all of the production team's business activities, from raw materials to finished products, from manpower to tools, from management to use, from income to expenditure, from production to distribution, etc., are carried out according to a certain plan. However, at that time, people's ideological understanding varied greatly. Some said, "Anyway, the meat rots in the pot, the wool comes from the sheep, it doesn't matter whether we do cost accounting or not." In order to solve this problem, the Party Branch organized the team cadres to summarize last year's production: the team's income was more than 140,000 yuan, and the cost was more than 94,700 yuan; compared with 1957, the income increased by 14.3%, but the expenditure increased by 15%, and the growth rate of expenditure exceeded the growth rate of income. The facts criticized that erroneous idea and made the masses realize that only by reducing costs can we increase production and income more.

    The primary link in reducing costs is to implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running the commune, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the commune members, and obtain greater results with a small amount of expenditure. The team adhered to the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods, relying on its own efforts, and actively mobilized commune members to work hard and cleverly, and carry out inventions and creations on a large scale. Commune members built their own chemical fertilizer and pesticide factories, manufacturing fourteen kinds of indigenous pesticides and more than 2 million jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer. Pesticides alone reduced expenditure by more than 1,000 yuan compared to last year.

    Improving labor efficiency and managing various crops in a timely manner is also an important aspect of reducing costs. The team has always paid attention to labor management, promoted various contracting systems and responsibility systems, and greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses for labor. The full attendance rate of men and women semi-able-bodied laborers in the whole team reached more than 97% in June and July, and the average labor force did 1.2 workdays per day.

    Strict financial expenditure, resolutely not spending what can be avoided, and resolutely replacing what can be replaced, is also an important method of reducing costs. In this regard, special attention was paid to agricultural machinery projects, which had large expenditures, and machinery operators were organized to carry out high-speed, safe, and economical competitions, with remarkable results.

    加强经济核算保证增产增收
    小寨公社今年生产费用将比去年减少五万多元
    本报讯　河北衡水县小寨公社东兴生产队，在超产竞赛运动中，加强经济核算工作，大力降低生产成本，以较少的人力、物力和财力消耗，取得更大的增产效果。
    东兴生产队的一千六百多亩粮食作物和二千七百多亩经济作物，生长情况都超过了去年。最近公社组织的产量联评，这个队的粮食亩产预计将比去年增长55％，棉花亩产将比去年增长43％。可是生产成本却比去年低得多。全队1至7月份实际开支二万七千八百五十元，占计划成本的66.7％。预计今后在作物后期追肥、浇水等方面，需要再开支一千七百七十元。总计全年每亩土地的实际成本只合六元零四分，占全年成本计划的71％，比去年减少了五万五千多元。按全大队一千四百六十一人计算，只这一项，每人能多收入三十八元多。
    成本核算是在今年春季制订生产计划时提出来的。党的支部委员会计划通过成本核算，促使生产队的全部经营活动，从原料到成品、从人力到工具、从管理到使用、从收入到支出、从生产到分配等等，都按照一定的计划进行。可是当时人们的思想认识大不一致，有的说：“反正肉烂在锅里，羊毛出在羊身上，搞不搞成本核算不吃劲”。为解决这一问题，党支部组织队干部对去年的生产进行了总结：全队收入十四万多元，成本合九万四千七百多元；和1957年相比，收入增加了14.3％，开支却增加了15％，开支增长的速度超过了收入的增长速度。事实批判了那种错误思想，使群众认识到只有降低成本，才能更多的增产增收。
    降低成本的首要一环，是贯彻勤俭办社的方针，发挥社员的积极性和创造性，以少量的支出获得较大的效果。这个队坚持了土洋并举、自力更生的精神，积极发动社员苦干巧干，大搞发明创造。社员自己动手建立了化肥、农药制造厂，制造出十四种土农药和二百多万斤土化肥。只农药一项就比去年减少开支一千多元。
    提高劳动效率，及时管好各种作物，也是降低成本的一个重要方面。这个队始终注意了劳动管理，推行各种包工制和责任制，大大调动了群众的劳动积极性。全队男女半劳力6、7月份全勤人数达到97％多，平均一个劳动力一天做一点二个劳动日。
    严格财务开支，能不花的坚决不花，能代替的坚决代替，也是降低成本的重要方法。在这方面，特别抓住了开支费用较大的农业机械项目，组织机械手开展高速、安全、节约竞赛，成绩十分显著。
