    British Aircraft Industry Massively Laying Off Workers

    (Report) Just as the British aircraft industry is stepping up its "rationalization" of production, British aircraft workers are once again facing a terrible threat of unemployment. According to the British "Financial Times" of August 19, in order to strengthen export competitiveness, the British aircraft industry plans to hand over the manufacture of fuselages to four large aircraft companies, and the manufacture of aircraft engines to two large aircraft companies. As a result of this "rationalization" measure, the number of workers employed in the British aircraft industry will soon drop from nearly 260,000 in 1957 to 150,000, a reduction of nearly 42%.

    Currently, with the implementation of "rationalization", some British aircraft companies have already begun to lay off workers.

    "Short Brothers and Harland Aircraft Company," which employs 9,000 workers, has decided to cut 1,200 workers by the end of the year. "Fairey Aviation Company" in Southampton has already laid off 1,000 workers this year.

    英国飞机制造业大裁工人
    本报讯　在英国飞机制造业加紧进行生产“合理化”前夕，英国飞机制造业工人又面临着可怕的失业威胁。据英国8月19日“金融时报”透露，英国飞机制造业为了加强出口竞争能力，准备把机身的制造，交给四个大飞机公司，飞机引擎则交由两个大飞机公司去制造。由于这一“合理化”措施，英国飞机制造业的雇用工人人数不久将由1957年的近二十六万人下降到十五万人，即减少近42％。
    目前，随着生产“合理化”的推行，英国一些飞机公司已在开始着手解雇工人。
    雇有九千工人的“肖特兄弟和哈兰飞机公司”已决定在年底前削减一千二百名工人。南安普敦的“法兰飞机制造公司”今年已裁减了一千名工人。
