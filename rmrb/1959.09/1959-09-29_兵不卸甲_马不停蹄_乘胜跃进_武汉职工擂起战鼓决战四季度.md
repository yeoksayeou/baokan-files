    兵不卸甲　马不停蹄　乘胜跃进
    武汉职工擂起战鼓决战四季度
    据新华社武汉28日电　在大战8、9月取得重大成绩、市属工业已提前十一天完成第三季度计划的武汉市，又擂起了决战第四季度的战鼓。
    26日，全市一千八百多名先进生产者和先进集体的代表举行誓师大会，一致向党表示决心：继续苦干巧干，把增产节约运动推向新高峰，为提前完成全年的跃进计划而奋勇前进。
    武汉钢铁公司的代表提出要在第四季度内，把铁的平均日产水平从现在的三千九百多吨逐月提高到四千五百吨，钢提高一倍以上，钢铁的合格率达到98％以上。长江航线上七万职工发出的誓言是：千方百计大挖船舶潜力，提高港口吞吐能力，把客、货运量比去年同期提高25％，并且节约煤炭二万五千吨、柴油二千五百吨。许多部门根据反右倾鼓干劲的精神提出的第四季度计划，都大大超过了前三个季度。如机电系统今后三个月的产品、产量计划，分别为上半年的三倍和七倍多。
    各行业以及小组、个人之间，在誓师大会上热烈展开了挑战应战。武汉市八大旗手之一的湖北拖拉机厂金工徐伯勋，向另一位旗手、武汉重型机床厂调整工马学礼提出挑战，条件是：在大战第四季度中，实现五项重大技术革新，作到一人顶两人，提前一个半月超额完成国家计划，保证质量达到百分之百；同时，帮助一两个小组和本组的三个工人达到先进水平。马学礼立即上台应战，条件是：从现在到年底，针对生产关键实现二十项技术革新，并且帮助新工人实现较大的革新五十项，帮助本工部完成计划较差的小组赶上先进水平。
    中共武汉市委第一书记宋侃夫代表市委、市人民委员会向大会宣布了第四季度的战斗任务，号召全市职工高举总路线的红旗，乘胜前进。
