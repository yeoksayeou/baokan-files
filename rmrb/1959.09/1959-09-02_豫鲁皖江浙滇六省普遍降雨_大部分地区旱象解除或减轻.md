Xinhua News Agency Report: In recent days, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Yunnan provinces have experienced widespread rainfall, alleviating drought conditions in most areas. Farmers in these provinces are seizing the opportunity after the rain to strengthen field management of late autumn crops, striving for a bountiful harvest.

　　Since late August, 105 counties and cities in Henan Province have received rainfall, covering an area of over 50 million mu. Drought conditions have been alleviated on over 10 million mu of farmland, and the total drought-affected area in the province has decreased to 20 million mu.

　　Most areas of Shandong Province have received rainfall in recent days, basically eliminating the drought. The Yantai area and the southeastern parts of Qingdao City, Changwei, Linyi and other special districts experienced torrential rain on August 30th and 31st. Local people braved the rain to carry out emergency drainage, protecting the crops.

　　From 8:00 AM on August 30th to 3:00 AM on September 1st, Anhui Province experienced widespread rainfall. In more than half of the counties, the rainfall generally ranged from 30 to 50 millimeters, with some individual areas receiving around 80 millimeters. However, rainfall was scarce in some areas, and the drought situation has not yet been alleviated.

　　After rainfall on August 30th and 31st, most areas of the seven special districts of Jiangsu Province have been relieved of drought. The average rainfall in the Subei region was around 100 millimeters. The Changzhou Special District in southern Jiangsu, which originally had the most severe drought, and Jiangning, Liuhe and other counties near Nanjing City, have now received relatively sufficient rainfall, greatly alleviating the drought.

　　Zhejiang Province has experienced continuous rainfall for four days since August 29th. All counties and cities in the province, except for Lanxi County, have received rain, generally over 30 millimeters. The minimum was 15 millimeters. The drought has been largely alleviated in the province's 1.57 million mu of drought-affected crops.

　　Since mid-August, various parts of Yunnan Province have received successive rainfall, generally reaching about 50 to 150 millimeters. At present, except for some slight drought remaining in Chuxiong, Lintong, Quqing, Yuxi and other special districts (autonomous prefectures), most areas have basically been relieved of drought.

    大部分地区旱象解除或减轻
    据新华社讯  最近几天，河南、山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、云南六省普遍降雨，大部分地区旱象解除。这些省份的农民正抓紧雨后时机，加强晚秋作物的田间管理，力争丰收。
    河南省8月下旬以来有一百零五个县、市降了雨，降雨面积达五千余万亩，一千多万亩受旱农田解除了旱象，全省受旱面积已下降到二千万亩。
    山东省大部分地区最近几天先后下雨，旱象已基本解除。烟台地区及青岛市、昌潍、临沂等专区的东南部，8月30日和31日两天普降暴雨，当地人民冒雨抢险排水，保护庄稼。
    从8月30日早晨八时起到9月1日凌晨三时止，安徽省各地普遍降雨。半数以上县份的降雨量一般都在三十毫米到五十毫米左右，个别地区降雨量达八十毫米左右。还有一部分地区降雨很少，旱情仍未解除。
    江苏省七个专区的大部分地区，在8月30日、31日两天下雨后，旱象解除。苏北地区平均降雨量在一百毫米左右，原来旱情最严重的江苏南部的常州专区及南京市附近江宁、六合等县，现在大多得到较充足的雨量，旱情大大减轻。
    浙江省从8月29日起持续降雨四天，除兰溪县外，全省各县、市都下了雨，雨量一般在三十毫米以上。最少为十五毫米。全省受旱的一百五十七万亩农作物，目前旱象已大部解除。
    云南省各地从8月中旬以来陆续下雨，降雨量一般都达到五十到一百五十毫米左右。目前，除楚雄、临通、曲清、玉溪等专区（自治州）尚有部分轻微干旱以外，绝大部分地区基本解除了旱象。
