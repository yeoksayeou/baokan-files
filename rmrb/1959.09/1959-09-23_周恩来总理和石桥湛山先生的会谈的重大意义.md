The former Japanese Prime Minister, Tanzan Ishibashi, has concluded his visit to Beijing. During this time, Chairman Liu Shaoqi met with Mr. Ishibashi and had friendly talks. During this time, our Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi and Mr. Ishibashi frankly exchanged opinions in a friendly atmosphere and issued a communique on the 20th. The communique clearly stated that the people of China and Japan should join hands to contribute to peace in the Far East and the world. It also pointed out that, in order to achieve the above objectives, the people of China and Japan should adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, to strive to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, enhance mutual trust between the two peoples, improve existing relations between the two countries, and cooperate to restore normal relations between the two countries at an early date. These propositions are in line with the common interests of the people of China and Japan, reflect the desire of the people of Asia and the world for peace, and the Chinese people heartily welcome them.

The communique of the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Mr. Ishibashi has aroused strong reactions in Japan. The majority of Japanese public opinion welcomed it, and Japanese political activists including Inajiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, Tetsuya Katayama, former Japanese Prime Minister, and Kenzo Matsumura, advisor to the Liberal Democratic Party, issued statements expressing their support. These reactions show that promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding peace in the Far East are the wishes of the people of China and Japan. However, there are also some people with ulterior motives who do not hesitate to distort the facts and viciously attack the communique in an attempt to dilute its impact on the broad masses of the people. Masajiro Kawashima, Secretary-General of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, and Etsusaburo Shiina, Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, are representatives of this type of people. They made statements on the communique, saying that the claim that the Nobusuke Kishi group has always adopted a policy of hostility towards China and created the "two Chinas" conspiracy is "completely unfounded." They expressed great dissatisfaction with Ishibashi's advocacy of the inseparability of politics and economics, believing that "the issue of separation of politics and economics is not only the idea of the Kishi Cabinet, but also the unanimous conclusion of the free world." This statement fully exposes the Nobusuke Kishi group's position of resolutely following the United States, creating "two Chinas," and being hostile to the Chinese people. In Japan, not only do the broad masses of the people oppose the reactionary thoughts and actions of the Nobusuke Kishi group, but also insightful Japanese figures, as Mr. Tanzan Ishibashi said: "We have not tolerated such thoughts and actions in the past, and we cannot tolerate them in the future."

The Chinese people have consistently advocated promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and restoring normal relations between China and Japan based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. Since the changes in Japan's situation after World War II, the Chinese people have always expressed their willingness to be friendly with Japan and have taken various measures proactively in practical actions to improve relations with Japan. Premier Zhou Enlai's invitation to Mr. Ishibashi to visit China once again proves that the Chinese people are willing to live in peace with Japan. However, as the communique pointed out, the friendship between China and Japan and the normalization of Sino Japanese relations must be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference. We will never allow the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi group to regard the Chinese people's good intentions to be friendly with Japan as a sign of Chinese weakness or as a means for it to engage in double-dealing, ingratiate itself with the United States, and seek economic benefits. We must point out that, as mentioned above, the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi group still insists on implementing a policy of hostility towards China, conspiring to create "two Chinas," and hindering the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, and these are the main obstacles to improving Sino-Japanese relations today.

In the communique, Premier Zhou Enlai further pointed out that the development of political and economic relations between China and Japan must be combined and cannot be separated. Mr. Ishibashi also agreed with this. We believe that Mr. Ishibashi's statement is wise. As everyone knows, politics is the concentrated expression of economics. It is not feasible to completely separate politics and economics as a principle for dealing with problems. No independent country in the world can allow another country to openly be hostile to itself politically while developing economic and cultural relations with that country. Mr. Ishibashi's visit to our country this time, and other Japanese politicians will also come to our country to promote Sino-Japanese friendship in the future. Their visits themselves are political actions. Such political actions will be able to provide favorable conditions for promoting economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan.

Another important issue pointed out in the communique is that Mr. Ishibashi stated that the current situation and existing international relations of Japan are unsatisfactory and that the greatest efforts should be made to change them as soon as possible and gradually promote their realization. Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed this and pointed out that we are willing to see the Japanese people realize the above-mentioned wishes as soon as possible, and the Chinese people will vigorously support the efforts of the Japanese people to achieve this goal, and sincerely sympathize with the Japanese people's desire for independence, freedom, democracy, peace, and neutrality. We believe that today, what is hindering the Japanese people from realizing their desire for independence, freedom, democracy, peace, and neutrality is US imperialism and its handful of followers, the Nobusuke Kishi group. Since the war, the Japanese people have been demanding to get rid of American control and strive for Japan's complete independence. Since last year, people from all walks of life in Japan have launched a vigorous movement against the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty"; so far, six large-scale joint struggles have been held. It is by no means accidental that the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" can achieve such vigorous development. Today, more and more Japanese people have realized that the revised Japan-US "Security Treaty" will essentially form a Japan-US military alliance, bring the Japanese people to the brink of war, make Japan once again an enemy of China and the Soviet Union, and an enemy of the Asian people, thereby threatening peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people warmly support the Japanese people's urgent demand for the withdrawal of American troops from Japan, the abolition of American military bases, and the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. The Chinese people express warm sympathy and support for the Japanese people's strong desire and actions to change the status quo, just as the peace-loving Japanese people clearly believe that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, supporting the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, which is completely understandable.

Mr. Ishibashi has now concluded his visit to Beijing. As Premier Zhou said at Mr. Ishibashi's farewell banquet, we hope that Mr. Ishibashi will convey the Chinese people's desire to be friendly with the Japanese people to the Japanese people after returning to his country.

After Mr. Ishibashi's visit to China, Mr. Kenzo Matsumura, advisor to the Liberal Democratic Party, will also visit China, and we welcome him. Mr. Ishibashi and many insightful figures in the Liberal Democratic Party advocate Sino-Japanese friendship, peaceful coexistence, and demand changes in Japan's current situation and existing international relations. Mr. Ishibashi's visit to our country has made a beneficial contribution to promoting friendship between the people of China and Japan. We wish Mr. Ishibashi and his party a safe journey, and hope that Mr. Ishibashi, together with insightful Japanese figures, will work together to gradually overcome the expected difficulties in order to realize the propositions pointed out in the communique: promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, peaceful coexistence, and demanding changes in Japan's current situation and existing international relations.

### 周恩来总理和石桥湛山先生的会谈的重大意义

    周恩来总理和石桥湛山先生的会谈的重大意义
    日本前首相石桥湛山已经结束了在北京的访问。在这期间，刘少奇主席接见了石桥先生，并进行了友好的谈话。在这期间，我国周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和石桥先生，在友好的气氛中，坦率地交换了意见，并于20日发表了公报。公报明确地表示，中日两国人民应该携起手来，为远东和世界和平作出贡献；并且指出，为着实现上述目的，中日两国人民应该根据互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则，努力促进中日两国人民的友好，增强两国人民的相互间的信任，改善两国的现存关系，并且为早日恢复两国的正常关系而进行合作。这些主张，符合于中日两国人民的共同利益，反映了亚洲和世界人民要求和平的愿望，中国人民对此衷心地表示欢迎。
    周恩来总理和石桥先生的会谈公报在日本引起了强烈的反应。日本舆论界多数表示欢迎，日本的政治活动家包括日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、日本前首相片山哲和自由民主党顾问松村谦三都发表谈话表示支持。这些反应表明促进中日友好、维护远东和平是中日两国人民的意愿。但是，也有一些别有用心的人，不惜颠倒黑白，对公报进行恶毒的攻击，企图借此冲淡公报在广大人民中的印象。像日本自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎、岸信介内阁官房长官椎名悦三郎就是这一类人的代表。他们就公报发表谈话说，关于岸信介集团一向采取敌视中国的政策和制造“两个中国”阴谋的说法，是“完全没有根据的”，他们对石桥赞成政治和经济不可分开的主张表示十分不满，认为“政治和经济分开的问题不仅是岸内阁的想法，而且是自由主义国家一致的结论”。这种言论充分暴露了岸信介集团坚决追随美国、制造“两个中国”、与中国人民为敌的立场。在日本，不仅广大的人民反对岸信介集团这种反动的思想和行动，就是有见识的日本人士，也正如石桥湛山先生所说：“过去未曾容忍这种思想和行动，今后也是不能容忍的。”
    中国人民一贯主张根据和平共处的原则，促进中日友好，恢复中日两国的正常关系。自从第二次世界大战后日本的处境发生变化以来，中国人民一直表示愿意同日本友好，并在实际行动中主动地采取各种措施，改善同日本的关系。周恩来总理此次邀请石桥先生访华，再一次证明中国人民是愿意和日本友好相处的。不过，正如公报所指出的，中日两国的友好和中日关系的正常化，必须以和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则为基础。我们决不允许日本岸信介集团，把中国人民愿意同日本友好的善良愿望，当作中国人民的软弱可欺，当作它玩弄两面手法、取媚美国、谋求经济实惠的手段。我们不能不指出，正如上文所说，日本岸信介集团至今坚持执行敌视中国、阴谋制造“两个中国”和阻挠中日关系正常化的政策，而这些正是今天改善中日两国关系的主要障碍。
    在公报中，周恩来总理进一步指出，中日两国政治和经济关系的发展必须结合起来，不能予以分割。对此，石桥先生也表示同意。我们认为，石桥先生的这一表示是明智的。谁都知道，政治是经济的集中表现。把政治和经济完全分割开来作为处理问题的原则，是行不通的。世界上没有任何一个独立的国家，可以一面听任另一个国家在政治上露骨地敌视自己，一面又同这一个国家发展经济和文化关系。石桥先生此次来我国访问，今后也还有其他日本政治家为促进中日友好前来我国访问。他们这种访问本身就是政治性的行动。这样一种政治性的行动，将能够为促进中日两国之间的经济和文化交流提供有利的条件。
    公报指出的另一个重要问题，就是石桥先生表示，日本的现状和现存的国际关系，有不能令人满意之处，应该尽最大努力，早日加以改变，并且逐步促其实现。周恩来总理对此表示欢迎，并且指出，我们愿意看到日本人民能够早日实现上述愿望，中国人民将大力支持日本人民为实现这一目标而作的努力，衷心同情日本人民关于独立、自由、民主、和平、中立的愿望。我们认为，今天阻挠日本人民实现其独立、自由、民主、和平、中立的愿望的，就是美国帝国主义及其一小撮追随者岸信介集团。战后日本人民一直要求摆脱美国的控制，争取日本的完全独立。去年以来，日本各阶层人民展开了反对修改日美“安全条约”的轰轰烈烈的运动；到目前为止，已经举行了六次规模巨大的联合斗争。日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争，能够获得这样汹涌蓬勃的发展，决不是偶然的。今天，越来越多的日本人民已经认识到修改后的日美“安全条约”，将在实质上结成日美军事同盟，把日本人民带向战争的边缘，使日本再一次与中国、苏联为敌，与亚洲人民为敌，从而威胁远东和世界的和平。中国人民热烈支持日本人民迫切要求从日本撤退美国军队、撤销美国军事基地，并收回冲绳和小笠原群岛。中国人民对于日本人民这种强烈要求改变现状的愿望和行动，表示热烈的同情和支持，正如爱好和平的日本人民明确地认为台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾问题是中国的内政，支持中国人民解放台湾一样，是完全可以理解的。
    石桥先生今天已经结束了在北京的访问。正如周总理在石桥先生辞别酒会上所讲的，我们希望石桥先生回国以后，把中国人民愿意同日本人民友好的愿望，转达给日本人民。
    在石桥先生访问中国以后，自由民主党的顾问松村谦三先生也将来中国访问，我们表示欢迎。石桥先生和不少自由民主党的明智的人士，是主张中日友好、和平共处及要求改变日本的现状和现存的国际关系的。石桥先生这次访问我国，对促进中日两国人民的友好，作出了有益的贡献。我们谨祝石桥先生一行人旅途平安，并且希望石桥先生为实现公报所指出的促进中日友好、和平共处以及要求改变日本的现状和现存国际关系的主张，能够与日本有见识的人士一起，共同努力，以便逐步排除意料中的困难。
