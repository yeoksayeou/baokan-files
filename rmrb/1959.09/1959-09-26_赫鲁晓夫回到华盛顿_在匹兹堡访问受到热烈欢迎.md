Xinhua News Agency, September 25th, Dispatch from Moscow: TASS, Washington, September 24th—Local time 17:27 on the 24th, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and his entourage returned to Washington by plane after visiting various parts of the United States.

Khrushchev traveled by car from Andrews Air Force Base to the presidential guest residence, Blair House.

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th, Dispatch from Pittsburgh: According to a TASS dispatch from Pittsburgh, Khrushchev and his entourage visited the “Mesta” Machine Company in Pittsburgh on the 24th. The company's vice managers, Mesta and Powell, welcomed Khrushchev at the company entrance. Powell welcomed Khrushchev on behalf of the company's employees and expressed gratitude for Khrushchev's visit to the company. He recalled that before the Second World War, the company had supplied equipment to the Soviet Union.

In his reply, Khrushchev expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome he had received. He recalled that the "Mesta" company had commercial ties with the Soviet Union in the past. He also spoke about the issue of US trade restrictions on the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that it was obvious that the Americans had lost some of their strengths. In the past, they had boldly traded with all countries.

Khrushchev called for joint efforts to bring the two countries closer together and develop trade that would help consolidate peace.

Then, Khrushchev visited the workshop and was welcomed by thousands of workers. Dozens of hands reached out to Khrushchev. Cheers of “Good,” “Welcome,” and “Peace” were shouted in Russian and English. A worker walked up to Khrushchev and presented him with a cigar as a souvenir. Khrushchev took off his watch and gave it to the worker.

During his tour of the factory, Khrushchev pointed out that some outdated machines were still being used in the workshops. He said that we would not buy such machines.

Worker Zastupnevich welcomed Khrushchev in Russian. He was born in Belarus and came to the United States with his parents in 1913, and now works in this factory. During his conversation with this worker, Khrushchev described the tremendous changes that had taken place in the city of Minsk, Belarus, during the Soviet era.

Khrushchev left the factory to a warm send-off from the workers and factory management. On the way to the hotel, hundreds of thousands of people welcomed Khrushchev. A reporter said that he had never seen so many people gathered on the streets of Pittsburgh. People held up signs written in Russian and English: "Welcome to our visit!", "Have a good trip!", "Goodbye!", "Please come again!" After failing in their attempts to disrupt the atmosphere of genuine enthusiasm, a few hooligans sheepishly disappeared among the Americans who were giving a friendly welcome to the leader of the Soviet state. More than 10,000 citizens welcomed Khrushchev at the hotel entrance.

After a short rest, Khrushchev went to the University of Pittsburgh, where Pennsylvania Governor Lawrence, Pittsburgh Mayor Gallagher, and University of Pittsburgh President Litchfield hosted a banquet for Khrushchev. About 500 people from Pittsburgh's political, social, and business circles attended the banquet. (Attached picture)

    赫鲁晓夫回到华盛顿
    在匹兹堡访问受到热烈欢迎
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社华盛顿讯：24日当地时间十七点二十七分，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员在访问美国各地以后乘飞机回到华盛顿。
    赫鲁晓夫乘汽车从安德鲁斯空军基地前往总统客人的住所“布莱尔大厦”。
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社匹兹堡讯：赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员24日参观了匹兹堡“梅斯塔”机器公司。在公司门口欢迎赫鲁晓夫的有公司的副经理梅斯塔和鲍威尔。鲍威尔代表公司职工欢迎赫鲁晓夫，并对赫鲁晓夫访问这个公司表示感谢。他追述说，在第二次世界大战前，这个公司就以装备供给过苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫在致答词时对给予他的热烈欢迎表示感谢。他追述说，“梅斯塔”公司在过去曾经同苏联有过商业上的联系。他并且谈到了美国对苏联的贸易限制问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，很明显，美国人丧失了自己的某些长处。在过去他们曾大胆地同所有国家进行贸易。
    赫鲁晓夫呼吁共同努力以便使两国更加接近和发展有利于巩固和平的贸易。
    然后，赫鲁晓夫参观车间，受到了数千工人的欢迎。几十只手伸向赫鲁晓夫。用俄语和英语欢呼：“好呵”、“欢迎”、“和平”。一位工人走向赫鲁晓夫并送给赫鲁晓夫一支雪茄烟作纪念。赫鲁晓夫摘下自己的手表，赠给那个工人。
    赫鲁晓夫在参观工厂时指出，各车间里还使用一些过时的机器。他说，我们不会购买这种机器。
    工人扎斯图普涅维奇用俄语欢迎赫鲁晓夫。他是白俄罗斯出生的人，1913年随父母来到美国，现在在这家工厂工作。赫鲁晓夫同这个工人交谈时叙述了苏维埃政权年代白俄罗斯明斯克市发生的巨大变化。
    赫鲁晓夫在工人和厂方的热烈欢送下离开了工厂。在到旅馆的一路上，有成千上万的人欢迎赫鲁晓夫。一个记者说，他从来还没有见过匹兹堡街头上集聚这么多的人。人们举着用俄文和英文写的标语牌：“欢迎您访问我们！”、“一路平安！”、“再见！”、“请您再来！”个别的一些流氓在破坏真挚热情会见气氛的企图遭到失败以后，灰溜溜地在友好欢迎苏联国家领导人的美国人当中销声匿迹了。在旅馆门口有一万多市民欢迎赫鲁晓夫。
    赫鲁晓夫在稍事休息之后前往匹兹堡大学，宾夕法尼亚州州长劳伦斯、匹兹堡市市长加拉格尔和匹兹堡大学校长利奇菲耳德在那里设宴招待赫鲁晓夫。出席宴会的匹兹堡政界人士、社会人士和实业界人士等约五百人。（附图片）
