Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 14th: According to Indian newspapers, the Indian People's Socialist Party, notorious for its anti-China stance, organized a group of people in Delhi on September 11th to hold a rally. The party's leaders frantically attacked China for "invading" India and demanded that the Indian government take "strong measures to repel the Chinese army."

This rally was the final act of the "Don't Interfere with India Week" farce directed by the People's Socialist Party to incite an anti-China movement by exploiting the border dispute caused by the intrusion of Indian troops into Chinese territory. Attendees shouted anti-China slogans such as "Chinese friendship is fake." After the rally, the party's Madhya Pradesh Chairman, Kamat, led the group in a march through the streets of Delhi, shouting reactionary slogans extremely hostile to China, such as "No Chinese imperialism interfering in India" and "Whoever clashes with India will be destroyed."

Kamat openly clamored for the use of violence against China at the meeting. He said, "If an individual or a country must choose between cowardice and violence, violence should be chosen." He said, "Let us organize militias in the border areas. If we wish, let us organize another Indian National Army."

He again repeated the slander that China had violated the Panchsheel principles, describing the new Tibet-Xinjiang highway built by China on its own territory as having been built "in India's Ladakh," and nonsensically claiming that "China violated the first principle of the Panchsheel - mutual respect for territorial integrity."

The Delhi People's Socialist Party Chairman, Mustaq Ahmed, greatly slandered China at the meeting, even saying that China was forced to shout "Indian and Chinese people are brothers" on one hand, while stretching its claws into Indian territory on the other.

The People's Socialist Party General Secretary, Foray, also made a series of anti-China and anti-communist remarks at the meeting.

According to a report by the Indian Press Trust on the 13th, the Congress Party Orissa State Executive Committee passed a resolution to incite a "condemn China and the Indian Communist Party" movement within the state. The Congress Party will organize rallies throughout the state to "protest" the fabricated Chinese incursion into the Indian border.

The leader of the extreme right-wing "Freedom Party," Rajagopalachari, published an article in the "Independent" weekly on the 13th, demanding that the United States give India the "best help" that is better than any other form of assistance - agreeing to restore China's seat in the United Nations, so that China itself can reject the invitation and "become its own condemner."

    印度人民社会党又上演一出反华丑剧
    大喊大叫要对中国使用暴力
    新华社新德里14日电　据印度报纸报道，以反华而臭名远扬的印度人民社会党9月11日在德里组织的一帮人举行集会，这个党的首领们在会上疯狂攻击中国“侵略”了印度，要求印度政府采取“强有力措施击退中国军队”。
    这个集会是人民社会党借印度军队侵入中国领土所造成的边境纠纷煽动反华运动而导演的“不许干涉印度周”丑剧的最后一场。出席集会的人喊着“中国友谊是假的”等反华口号。集会结束后，这个党的中央邦主席卡马特率领着这群人在德里街道游行，大叫“不许中国帝国主义干涉印度”、“谁同印度发生冲突谁就遭到毁灭”等极端敌视中国的反动口号。
    卡马特在会上公然叫嚷对中国采用暴力，他说，“如果个人或国家必须在懦弱和暴力之间作一选择，那应当选择暴力。”他说，“让我们在边区把民兵组织起来。如果我们希望的话，让我们组织另外一支印度国民军。”
    他再次重复所谓中国违反了潘查希拉的谰言，他把中国在自己领土上修建的新藏公路说成是“在印度的拉达克”修建了公路，并且胡说什么“中国违反了潘查希拉的第一个原则——互相尊重领土完整。”
    德里人民社会党主席穆斯塔格·艾哈迈德在会上大肆诬蔑中国，他竟说中国是一面被迫喊着“印中人民是兄弟”，一面把它的爪子伸进印度的领土。
    人民社会党总书记福雷也在会上叫了一通反华反共的言论。
    据印度报业托辣斯13日报道，国大党奥里萨邦执行委员会通过一项决议，要在这个邦内煽起一个“谴责中国和印度共产党”运动。国大党将在这个邦各地组织集会“抗议”捏造的中国侵入印度边境事件。
    极右翼的“自由党”首领拉贾戈帕拉查里13日在“独立”周刊上发表文章，要求美国能够给印度比其他形式的援助都要好的“最好的帮助”——同意恢复中国在联合国的席位，以便让中国自己来拒绝这个邀请和“作它自己的谴责者”。
