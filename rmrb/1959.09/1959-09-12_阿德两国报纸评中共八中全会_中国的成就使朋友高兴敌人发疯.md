Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 10th: The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article on September 9th entitled "The Achievements of the Chinese People Make Friends Happy and Enemies Go Mad," commenting on the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee.

The commentary stated that the general line for socialist construction put forward by the Communist Party of China has been warmly embraced and implemented by the Chinese people. The truly brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people in all aspects of social, economic, and cultural life have astonished the world.

The commentary pointed out that after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, built a new, strong, and prosperous socialist country on the ruins of old China. China has become an important factor for stability and peace in the Pacific and Southeast Asian regions. The Albanian people regard the victory of the fraternal Chinese people as the victory of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The commentary stated that People's China's announcement of peaceful competition with Britain and its extremely important achievements not only prove the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, but also prove the unwavering trust of the Chinese people in the Communist Party that leads them.

The commentary pointed out that the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee is of particular importance. The commentary said that based on the achievements made in the past year and the first half of this year, the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee announced to the world that it is entirely possible to complete the originally planned major industrial and agricultural production targets for 1962 within this year. The work of the Eighth Plenary Session proves that the general line was and is correct, and that the necessary adjustments have been made to this year's plan based on the correctness of this line. The fact is that, although the figures have been adjusted, the original major targets for 1962 will be achieved by the end of this year.

The commentary pointed out that the enemies of socialism, however, violate reason and fact, and they are unwilling to see the steps of giants. The frantic imperialist groups viciously attack People's China and relentlessly slander the heroic efforts and outstanding achievements of the Chinese people, but these attempts have suffered disastrous failures.

The commentary said that for a long time, the revisionists in Belgrade have unreservedly and vociferously echoed the imperialists' clamor that curses People's China, fabricating thousands of slanders against the heroic vigor and great achievements of the Chinese people. For a long time, Western newspapers and news agencies have endlessly slandered China's Five-Year Plan, ridiculed China's will to catch up with Britain, and described the people's commune movement as fanaticism. In these shameful footprints, the Belgrade revisionists also followed, often competing with their masters, the imperialists.

After refuting the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" and the Yugoslav news agency's slander of the Chinese people's communes, the commentary said that the true situation of the people's communes is not as imagined by the imperialists and Yugoslav revisionists. As pointed out in the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session, the people's communes have developed and consolidated, and they are achieving brilliant results in improving production and the living standards of their members.

The commentary said that the Communist Party of China is completely correct in exposing right-leaning opportunism, those right-leaning opportunists who do not believe in the indestructible strength and great creativity of the people led by the Party. The Yugoslav news agency regrets that China regards the "right-leaning danger" as the greatest danger in the country's economic and political life. This attitude of the Yugoslav news agency is not surprising.

The commentary pointed out that hatred for socialism and for the achievements made by the socialist camp makes the Belgrade revisionists completely politically ignorant and uninformed. Because even the blind can now see how much power People's China possesses today, a country that less than a decade ago was one of the most suffering, poor, and backward countries in the world, but today is moving forward vigorously. Friends of the Chinese people are happy about the achievements made by the Chinese people. The achievements of People's China are indeed very great, and these achievements have shocked the world.

The commentary said that the Yugoslav revisionists' futile movement against People's China is only part of the activities against Marxism-Leninism, against the internationalist unity of the working people, and against the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. However, the howls of imperialism and revisionism cannot cover up the great victories of the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The "People's Army Daily" of the German Democratic Republic published an article on the 8th entitled "The Great Leap Forward of 650 Million People," stating that the significance of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is immeasurable for the further development of People's China and the entire socialist camp.

The article stated that from Tokyo to Paris, from Washington to Bonn, the bourgeois newspapers certainly tried their best to convince their readers that the Lushan Conference ended with the admission that the industrial and agricultural policies of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government had suffered a "complete failure." This is not surprising, because some people are looking at the facts through gray-tinted glasses. But for us, for the working people of China, for the people of other socialist countries, and for all progressive people in the world, the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee are precisely the reasons for making us happy and strengthening our confidence in victory.

The article pointed out that the most important decision of the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee is to declare the completion of the main tasks of China's Second Five-Year Plan by the end of this year as the central combat task. This means completing the most important tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.

The article wrote that in the peaceful competition between the two world systems, socialist countries take it as their task to catch up with and surpass capitalist countries. China's opponent is one of the oldest and most developed industrial countries in the capitalist world, Britain. Last year, China put forward the slogan "Catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years." Now, the Eighth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee pointed out that if we continue to leap forward as we have done so far, this great goal can be achieved in ten years. This task is realistic and there is every possibility of achieving it.

The article concluded by saying that the rapid strengthening of China's economic power is of great significance to us, not only because it is an important trading partner of ours, but also because it directly helps us in our struggle against atomic war, for peace treaties, and for the elimination of the remnants of World War II. People's China is one of the strongest pillars of the socialist camp. The stronger the forces of socialism and progress, the greater the guarantee of driving away all aggressors and atomic warmongers.

    阿德两国报纸评中共八中全会
    中国的成就使朋友高兴敌人发疯
    新华社地拉那10日电  阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”9日以“中国人民的成就使朋友高兴，使敌人发疯”为题发表文章，评论中共八中全会。
    评论说，中国共产党提出的建设社会主义的总路线得到了中国人民的热烈拥护和贯彻执行。中国人民在社会、经济和文化生活各方面所取得的真正辉煌的胜利，使全世界感到惊讶。
    评论指出，中华人民共和国建立之后，中国人民在共产党领导下在旧中国的废墟上，建设起新的、强大而繁荣的社会主义国家。中国已经成为太平洋和东南亚地区的稳定和平的重要因素。阿尔巴尼亚人民把兄弟般的中国人民的胜利看成是以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的胜利。
    评论说，人民中国向英国宣布的和平竞赛和它所取得的极其重要的成就，不仅证明了社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度，而且还证明了中国人民对领导他们的共产党的不可动摇的信任。
    评论指出，中共八中全会具有特别重要的意义。评论说，中共八中全会根据去年和今年上半年所取得的成就，向全世界宣布了在今年内提前完成原来规定的1962年工农业的主要生产指标，这是完全可能的。八中全会的工作证明，总路线在过去和现在都是正确的，根据这一路线的正确性而对今年计划作了必要的调整。事实是，虽然对数字作了调整，但1962年的原定的主要指标将在今年年底实现。
    评论指出，社会主义的敌人却违反理智和事实，他们不愿意看到巨人的步伐。疯狂的帝国主义集团恶毒攻击人民中国，对中国人民的英勇的努力和杰出的成就进行无休止的污蔑，但是，这些企图都遭到了惨重的失败。
    评论说，很早以来，贝尔格莱德的修正主义者就毫无保留地，声嘶力竭地和那些咒骂人民中国的帝国主义的叫嚣相呼应，对中国人民的英雄干劲和巨大的成就捏造出了成千上万次的污蔑。很早以来，西方的报纸和通讯社就层出不穷地污蔑中国的五年计划，把中国赶英国的意志当做笑柄，把人民公社运动说成是狂热。在这些可耻的脚印后面，贝尔格莱德修正主义者也跟着跑，他们常常同自己的主子——帝国主义者互相竞赛。
    评论在驳斥南斯拉夫，“战斗报”和南斯拉夫通讯社对中国人民公社的污蔑之后说，人民公社的真实情况并不像帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者所想像的那样。正如八中全会公报所指出的，人民公社发展和巩固了，它在提高生产和社员生活水平方面正在取得光辉的成果。
    评论说，中国共产党完全正确地揭露了右倾机会主义，那些右倾机会主义分子不相信党所领导的人民的不可摧毁的力量和伟大的创造力。南斯拉夫通讯社对中国把“右倾危险”当作是国家经济和政治生活中最大的危险这一点感到遗憾。南斯拉夫通讯社的这种态度并不令人感到奇怪。
    评论指出，对社会主义以及对社会主义阵营取得的成就的仇恨使得贝尔格莱德的修正主义者在政治上完全愚昧和无知。因为即使是瞎子现在也会看到人民中国今天拥有多么巨大的力量，这个国家虽然在不到十年以前还是世界上最痛苦、贫穷和落后的国家之一，但是它今天却生气勃勃地向前迈进。中国人民的朋友对中国人民取得的成就感到高兴。人民中国的成就的确是非常巨大的，这种成就使全世界感到震惊。
    评论说，南斯拉夫修正主义者所进行的枉费心机的反对人民中国的运动，只是反对马克思列宁主义、反对劳动人民的国际主义团结、反对以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的活动的一部分。但是，帝国主义和修正主义的嚎叫掩盖不了中国人民的巨大胜利。
    据新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国“人民军报”8日发表的一篇题为“六亿五千万人的大跃进”的文章说，对人民中国和整个社会主义阵营的进一步发展说来，中国共产党八届八中全会的意义是不可估量的。
    文章说，从东京到巴黎，从华盛顿到波恩，资产阶级报纸当然竭力想使它们的读者相信，庐山会议以承认了中国共产党和中国政府的工农业政策遭到一场“彻底的失败”而告终。这是不足为奇的，因为，有些人是戴上灰色眼镜看事实的。但是，对于我们来说，对于中国劳动人民来说，对其他社会主义国家的人民和全世界一切进步的人士来说，中共八中全会的决议正是使我们高兴并加强我们对胜利的信心的理由。
    文章指出，中共八届八中全会最重要的决定是，把到今年年底完成中国第二个五年计划的主要任务宣布为中心战斗任务。这就意味着比原定计划提前三年完成第二个五年计划规定的最重要的任务。
    文章写道，在两个世界体系的和平竞赛中，社会主义国家把赶上和超过资本主义国家做为自己的任务。中国的对手是资本主义世界中一个最老的、发达的工业国——英国。去年，中国提出的口号是“十五年内在主要工业产品产量上赶上英国水平”。现在，中共八届八中全会指出，如果像到目前为止一样地继续跃进，这个伟大的目标在十年内就能实现。这一任务是现实的，而且是有一切可能实现的。
    文章最后说，中国经济力量的急剧加强，对于我们来说，不仅因为它是我们的一个重要贸易伙伴而具有重大的意义，而且，在我们进行的反对原子战争、争取和约和消除第二次世界大战残迹的斗争中，这也直接地帮助了我们。人民中国是社会主义阵营的最坚强的支柱之一。社会主义和进步的力量越强大，赶走一切侵略者和原子好战分子的保证就越大。
