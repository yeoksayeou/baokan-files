Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 10th: Inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee, the army of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has launched a comprehensive leap forward in production across the northern and southern Tianshan Mountains.

	On the winter sowing front, whether in the Junggar Basin or the Tarim Basin, tens of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of tractors are working day and night to rush-plant winter wheat. The soldiers are plowing, sowing, reclaiming wasteland, and planting seeds simultaneously, striving in every possible way to complete all sowing in a timely manner. In the Manas River Basin, the farms in the Shihezi Reclamation Area have sown more than 100,000 mu of winter wheat in the past ten days or so. All the tractor drivers of the Anjihai Fourth Farm’s tractor team moved their luggage to the fields, plowing, sowing, and sleeping wherever they went. Workers at the Shihezi August 1st Machinery Factory repaired machines as soon as they arrived, and through hard work and ingenuity, they used ductile iron to make 2,100 plowshares instead of steel, sending them to the winter sowing front. In the more than 30 farms and ranches under the Agricultural Division One in the Tarim Basin, production efficiency has greatly improved after combating right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, resulting in a leap forward in both wasteland reclamation and sowing. The entire division has already reclaimed more than 74,000 mu of land. Currently, they are launching a high-quality, full-attendance, and high-efficiency competition to complete the task of reclaiming and sowing more than 170,000 mu by the end of September.

	The corps' hundreds of thousands of mu of cotton have generally begun to boll, growing better than last year. Tens of thousands of cotton field management troops in various reclamation areas are picking new cotton while actively taking technical measures to strive for more pre-frost cotton. Although the 150,000 mu of cotton in the Shihezi Reclamation Area of the Manas River Basin suffered six frost disasters and four hailstorms this year, the soldiers have worked hard in the fields in every possible way, and it is estimated that the yield can still increase by more than 50% compared to last year. At present, the soldiers are cutting off empty branches, removing old leaves, applying foliar fertilizer, and preparing to take root-cutting measures to ensure that pre-frost cotton increases from 30% last year to 80%.

	New upsurges in increasing production and practicing economy have also been launched in all aspects, such as threshing, accumulating fertilizer, and cutting and storing winter grass. More than 1,200 people at the Mosowan Second Farm in the Shihezi Reclamation Area launched the activity of "collecting a bundle of grass after work, and not walking the road empty-handed." In just five days, they used their spare time to cut and dry more than 168,000 jin of green grass and collect more than 48,000 jin of dry cotton leaves, storing a large amount of feed for livestock. The threshing efficiency of the Victory Fifteenth Farm has increased from 10,000 jin per day in the past to more than 30,000 jin. The original plan was to finish threshing by April next year, but now the soldiers have proposed to complete it all by September 20th.

### 天山南北掀起全面跃进的生产高潮  新疆生产建设兵团力争丰收

    新疆生产建设兵团力争丰收
    新华社乌鲁木齐10日电　新疆生产建设兵团大军在党中央伟大号召的鼓舞下，在天山南北掀起了全面跃进的生产高潮。
    在冬播战线上，不论是在准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地，现在每天都有数万名战士和数百台拖拉机，日夜抢播冬麦。战士们边犁、边播、边开荒、边播种，千方百计地力争全部适时播种。玛纳斯河流域石河子垦区各农场在最近的十几天内就播下了十多万亩冬麦。安集海四场拖拉机队的全部拖拉机手，都把行李搬到田间，犁到哪里，播到哪里，就睡到那里。石河子八一机械制造厂职工做到了机具随到随修，并且苦干巧干，以球墨铸铁代替钢制成了两千一百片犁铲，送到了冬播前线。在塔里木盆地农一师所属的三十多个农牧场里，经过反右倾、鼓干劲，生产效率大大提高，出现了开荒、播种齐跃进的局面，全师已开荒造田七万四千多亩。目前，他们正为在9月底以前完成十七万多亩开荒播种任务，开展优质、全勤、高工效竞赛热潮。
    全兵团的几十万亩棉花已普遍吐絮，生长胜过去年。各垦区数以万计的棉田管理大军正在一面摘拾新花，一面积极采取技术措施力争多收霜前花。玛纳斯河流域石河子垦区十五万亩棉花今年虽然遭到六次霜灾，四次雹灾，但是战士们千方百计，奋战田间，估计产量仍可比去年增加50％以上。目前，战士们正在打空枝，打老叶，根外喷肥和准备采取断根的措施，保证霜前花由去年的30％提高到80％。
    在打场、积肥、割贮冬草等各方面，也都已掀起轰轰烈烈的增产节约新高潮。石河子垦区莫索湾二农场的一千二百多人，展开了“收工一捆草，路不空走”的活动，仅仅五天时间就利用业余活动时间割晒青草十六万八千多斤，收集干棉叶四万八千多斤，为牲畜储备了大量饲草。胜利十五场的脱粒效率，由过去每天一万斤提高到三万多斤，原计划到明年4月才能脱粒结束，现在战士们提出要在9月20日就全部完成。
