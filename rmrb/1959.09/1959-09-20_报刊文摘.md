Well Done, Well-Managed, Timely

Right-leaning opportunists and those with right-leaning views say that running public canteens and achieving childcare is not suitable for today's level of production development, lacks a material and ideological foundation, and is something that was started in a rush to pursue "ization" through coercive orders. They believe that these undertakings were done too much, too early, and too quickly, and that this is a big mistake. Is this really the case? No! Their statement is completely inconsistent with the facts.

What kind of social production method leads to what kind of social lifestyle. Childcare organizations and public canteens generally would not arise on the basis of the individual, scattered natural economy of feudal society. These organizations began to exist in capitalist society because capitalist society had large-scale socialized production. Of course, although capitalist production is socialized, the ownership is private, which is fundamentally different from the nature of socialist socialized production. Only in socialist society, where the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, the proletariat has seized power, and on the basis of collectivized, socialized production and the continuous improvement of the level of production, have the fundamental conditions been created for the universal development of collective life and welfare undertakings, opening up the broadest path.

Does the development of collective life and welfare undertakings have a profound socio-economic foundation, and does it have a mass ideological foundation? The history of the development of collective life and welfare undertakings in our country has given a strong answer. After the land reform, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural production developed, the number of women participating in productive labor increased, and childcare organizations developed rapidly. In 1953, childcare organizations in rural China enrolled 850,000 children. In 1956, in the situation of a production upsurge after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, rural childcare organizations enrolled more than 6 million children. Public canteens also existed several years ago. During the mutual aid group phase, there were forms of cooperative cooking. A very small number of busy-farming canteens appeared in elementary cooperatives. During the advanced cooperative phase, a considerable number of busy-farming canteens existed in Henan, Anhui and other places. Sewing machines, steel mills, public mills, and flour milling groups also existed during the agricultural cooperative phase. Last year, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, there was a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. During the large-scale water conservancy projects and the busy summer harvest, with an unprecedented number of women participating in production, the broad masses of people urgently demanded the development of collective life and welfare undertakings. The people's commune was born precisely to meet the needs of this great leap forward. From the day it was born, it has shouldered the task of organizing collective production on a larger scale and the task of organizing collective life to meet the needs of production. Therefore, collective life and welfare undertakings have become an indispensable part of the people's commune, and have developed vigorously in the people's commune movement. Last year, the number of children enrolled in rural childcare organizations increased tenfold compared to 1957, reaching more than 60 million. Canteens spread throughout the countryside, with more than 90% of farm households joining the canteens. Other various life and welfare undertakings have also greatly developed. May I ask, right-leaning opportunists, such a mass movement of hundreds of millions of people, if there were no objective needs and the masses did not demand it, could anyone have started it with an order? Could anyone have made it happen with a gust of wind? On the contrary, things that follow the natural order, respond to human feelings, conform to the trend, and meet the needs, you can’t blow them down even if you want to. Isn't there such a fact? A right-leaning opportunist, overestimating his own strength, even wanted to compare himself to the God of Thunder, determined to strike down those canteens that could not be struck down by thunder. But contrary to his expectations, the masses were not afraid of thunder. They were determined to run the canteens and insisted on not dispersing them; some were temporarily dispersed, but soon recovered. In some places, because the leadership was relaxed, childcare centers once collapsed, but the women masses were the first to raise their opinions, and they quickly re-established them. This is the most straightforward and resounding answer of the masses to the right-leaning opportunists. This proves that things that do not conform to historical requirements will definitely collapse, and it is impossible to artificially maintain them. Things that conform to historical requirements will definitely not collapse, and it is impossible to artificially dissolve them. This is the great truth of historical materialism. The reason why collective life and welfare undertakings cannot collapse is precisely because they conform to historical requirements and meet the needs of the masses. It is not that they were done too early, too fast, or too much, but that they were done in a timely, correct, and good manner, and we must strive to do them better in the future.

Of course, in some places, when these undertakings were first started, due to lack of experience and poor management, the advantages were not fully realized, or there were indeed some shortcomings. But this is a matter of improving the work, and we must never allow the attitude of attacking one point and ignoring the rest, unilaterally seizing on some minor problems and arbitrarily denying the advantages of collective life and welfare undertakings themselves. Any newborn thing will never be perfect at the beginning, and it always grows and becomes stronger by overcoming difficulties and its own shortcomings, and it always gradually moves from imperfect to perfect. Collective life and welfare undertakings are also like this.

Can We Do It or Can’t We? Dare We Do It or Don’t We?

Do we need conditions for everything we do? Of course! Didn't Comrade Mao Zedong say: "No one can speculate without basis, and no one can plan his actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances." Denying conditions and exaggerating people's subjective initiative to the point where they can do whatever they want regardless of the conditions is not only falling into the quagmire of idealism in terms of understanding, but also causing many losses in practical work that could have been avoided. However, since we are dialectical materialists, we must never look at conditions with a mechanistic materialist point of view. Because, from the perspective of the dialectical materialist worldview, there are all kinds of conditions, there are unfavorable conditions and favorable conditions, there are material conditions and human conditions; conditions are also developing and changing, conditions that did not exist originally gradually develop, and originally unfavorable conditions can also gradually be transformed into favorable conditions. Looking at conditions with a mechanistic materialist point of view can only be superficial, one-sided, and static. Some comrades with right-leaning thoughts among our cadres have not gotten rid of the influence of this mechanistic materialism, so they often only see material conditions and ignore human conditions, only see unfavorable conditions and ignore favorable conditions, and do not see conditions developing and changing. Therefore, before things have even started, they show fear of difficulties and slackening, and turn what can be done into what cannot be done.

Of course, we must respect objective laws and never act against objective laws. Because objective laws are the inevitable trend of the development of things, the basis for the development and change of things, and are independent of people's will. If anyone wants to act against objective laws, they are speculating without basis. However, people are not destined to be powerless in the face of objective laws. For example, rivers flood, and water flows to lower places, but people can use dredging and damming to control river flooding. This shows that people can use the method of changing conditions to make objective laws play a role that is beneficial to people, and reduce or eliminate the role that is unfavorable to people. This is called people's subjective initiative.

    办得对，办得好，办得适时
    右倾机会主义分子和持有右倾观点的人说，举办公共食堂和实现托儿化不适合今天的生产发展水平，缺乏物质和思想基础，是一阵风刮起来的，是为了追求“化”，强迫命令办起来的。认为这些事业办得太多了，太早了，太快了，他们认为这是一个大错误。事实果真是这样的吗？不！他们这种说法完全不符合事实。
    什么样的社会生产方式就有什么样的社会生活方式。托儿组织、公共食堂，在封建社会的个体分散的自然经济基础上一般是不会产生的。在资本主义社会开始有了这种组织，这是因为资本主义社会有了社会化的大规模的生产。当然，资本主义生产虽是社会化，但占有是私人的，这和社会主义生产社会化的性质是根本不同的。只有在社会主义社会，生产关系发生了根本变化，无产阶级掌握了政权，在生产集体化、社会化和生产水平不断提高的基础上，才为集体生活福利事业的普遍发展创造了根本条件，开辟了最广阔的道路。
    集体生活福利事业的发展有没有深厚的社会经济基础，有没有群众思想基础，我国集体生活福利事业发展的历史已经作了有力的回答。在土地改革之后，随着互助合作运动的发展，农业生产发展了，参加生产劳动的妇女增多了，托儿组织就迅速地发展起来。1953年我国农村的托儿组织收托儿童已达八十五万人，1956年，在基本上完成了农业社会主义改造之后的生产高潮形势下，农村托儿组织收托儿童达到六百多万人。公共食堂也是几年以前就有了，在互助组时就有合伙作饭的形式，初级社即出现了极少数农忙食堂，高级社时在河南、安徽等地就有了相当数量的农忙食堂了。缝纫机、钢磨、公共磨房、磨面小组也是在农业合作社时就有了的。去年，在总路线的光辉照耀下，工农业生产大跃进，在大兴水利，大忙夏收，妇女空前众多地参加生产的情况下，广大群众迫切要求发展集体生活福利事业。人民公社正是适应这种大跃进形势的需要而产生的。它从出生之日起，就担负着组织更大范围的集体生产的任务，担负着适应生产需要组织集体生活的任务。因此，集体生活福利事业就成为人民公社的不可缺少的组成部分，在人民公社化运动中，蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来了。去年农村托儿组织收托儿童较1957年增加十倍，达到六千多万人。食堂遍及各个农村，入食堂农户达到90％以上。其他各种生活福利事业都有很大发展。请问右倾机会主义者，像这样几亿人民的群众运动，如果没有客观需要，不是群众要求，哪一个人能够下一个命令就办起来了呢？哪一个人能够一阵风吹起来呢？恰恰相反，这种顺乎天理，应乎人情，适乎潮流，合乎需要的东西，你们要想吹垮也是不可能的。不是有这样的事实吗？一位右倾机会主义者，自不量力，竟想自比雷公，决心要打垮那些雷打不散的食堂。可是出乎他的意料之外，群众不怕雷打，他们决心办食堂，坚持不散；有的虽然暂时散了，但不久又恢复了。还有些地方，因为放松了领导，托儿所曾一度垮台，妇女群众首先提出意见，她们很快就又办起来了。这就是群众对右倾机会主义分子最干脆最响亮的回答。这证明不合乎历史要求的东西，一定垮掉，人为地维持不垮是不可能的。合乎历史要求的东西，一定垮不了，人为地解散也是办不到的。这是历史唯物主义的大道理。集体生活福利事业所以垮不了，正说明它是合乎历史要求，合乎群众需要。不是办早了，办快了，办多了，而是办得适时，办得对，办得好，今后还要努力更加办好。
    当然，也有些地方，在初办这些事业的时候，由于缺乏经验，经营管理不善，优越性还发挥得不够，或者确曾有过一些缺点。但这是改进工作的问题，绝不能容许采取攻其一点不及其余的态度，片面地抓住一些小毛病，就对集体生活福利事业本身的优越性随意否定。任何新生的事物一开始总不会是十全十美的，总是通过克服困难和本身的缺点而后生长壮大的，总是由不完备而逐步走向完备的，集体生活福利事业也正是如此。
  （摘自“中国妇女”十八期专论：论集体生活福利事业的大发展。）
    能为不能为？敢为不敢为？
    我们做一切事情，要不要条件？当然要！毛泽东同志不是说过了吗：“任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动。”否认条件，把人的主观能动作用夸大到可以不问条件如何就可以为所欲为，这不仅是在认识上陷入了唯心主义的泥坑，而且在实际工作上也会造成许多本来可以避免的损失。可是，我们既然是辩证唯物主义者，我们就决不应当用机械唯物论的眼光来看待条件。因为，从辩证唯物主义的世界观来看，条件有种种，有不利条件也有有利条件，有物的条件也有人的条件；条件又是在发展变化的，原来没有的条件逐渐发展起来了，原来不利的条件也可以逐渐转化为有利的条件。用机械唯物主义的眼光来看待条件，就只能是表面的、片面的、静止的，我们干部中有些有右倾思想的同志没有摆脱这种机械唯物主义的影响，因而，他们就往往总是只看到物的条件而忽略了人的条件，只看到不利条件而忽略了有利条件，不看到条件在发展在变化，所以，在事情还未进行之前，就表现畏难松劲情绪，把能为说成了不能为。
    我们当然必须尊重客观规律，决不能违反客观规律去办事。因为客观规律是事物发展的必然趋势，是事物发展变化的根据，是不以人们意志为转移的，如果谁要违反客观规律办事，谁就是没有根据地胡思乱想。但是，人在客观规律的面前并不是命定的无能为力的，例如，江河泛滥，水是往低处流的，但是，人们可以用开河筑坝来制服江河泛滥。这说明人们可以用改变条件的办法，使客观规律发生有利于人的作用，减少或消除不利于人的作用。这就叫人的主观能动作用。
