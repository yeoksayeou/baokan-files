Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th -- The staff and workers of 130 state-owned farms in Guangdong Province are making every effort to create outstanding achievements in increasing production and practicing economy, dedicating themselves to the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

These state-owned farms mainly manage tropical cash crops, combined with the development of diversified operations. Since the beginning of August, the staff and workers of each farm have formulated plans for dedicating gifts to National Day, greatly boosting their energy and launching a high tide of increasing production and practicing economy. After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the workers were even more motivated, and the high tide of production became even higher. Many farm workers lit carbide lamps at night, working by moonlight, reclaiming land to plant tropical cash crops, and rushing to plant autumn crops and fruit trees. Four farms in the Hainan area, Nanmao, Nanping and others, have already overfulfilled their annual land reclamation and planting tasks. The planting progress of the Dongfanghong Farm used to be only twenty-one mu per day on average, but now it has leaped to one hundred and seventy mu. The amount of lemongrass harvested per labor force per day at the Haiou Farm had never reached 800 jin in the past, but now the third group of the tenth team of this farm has created a high record of averaging 805 jin harvested per person. The lemongrass oil extraction rate of the first processing plant of this farm in the first half of the year was 1.42%, but worker Liao Po, encouraged by the Party's call, boldly innovated technology and created the successful experience of a 2.016% lemongrass oil extraction rate. Thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of staff and workers, state-owned farms throughout the province have planted more than 31,000 mu of various fruit trees in August. In addition to ensuring the completion of this year's fruit tree planting and seedling cultivation plans, the staff and workers of each farm have also proposed to increase the planting of ten to thirty fast-growing fruit trees such as bananas per person to dedicate gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The livestock and poultry breeding industry of state-owned farms throughout the province has also seen a great leap forward this year. By the end of August, the farms throughout the province had raised more than 120,000 pigs, exceeding the annual breeding plan by 50%; the number of chickens, ducks, and geese had grown to more than 1.2 million, an increase of more than sixteen times compared with the number at the end of last year. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, each farm has tightened its grip on this production even more, and is now continuing to expand the planting of feed, while also launching a movement of livestock raising experts who manage and raise livestock well among the feeders. The staff and workers of state-owned farms in the Zhanjiang area have also put forward the fighting goal of doubling livestock and poultry production in September and October. Many farms have stepped up the work of fattening livestock and poultry, striving to market them early and supply more to urban residents to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th -- 200,000 staff and workers and their families in the fourteen state-owned farms (pastoral) of the Hejiang Reclamation Area in Heilongjiang are responding to the Party's call with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy, and are determined to dedicate themselves to the 10th anniversary of the National Day with the best production achievements.

The Luobei Farm, mainly composed of demobilized soldiers and youth voluntary reclamation teams, has completed the harvesting of more than 100,000 mu of wheat. The staff and workers proposed: to carefully thresh and harvest in threshing to ensure that each mu yields an extra ten jin of grain. They also proposed: to strengthen the later-stage field management of autumn crops and strive to increase production by twenty to thirty jin of grain per mu. Since the announcement of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, more than 2,000 people in the farm have been constantly weeding and loosening the soil in the fields every day to promote the early maturity and full grains of crops. From August 27th to September 5th, the farm had pulled out all the big weeds from 80,000 mu of autumn fields. Tractors are ploughing deeply day and night on the land where wheat has just been harvested to prepare conditions for continued leaps forward next year.

While ensuring agricultural production increases, the staff and workers of the Baoquanling Farm are vigorously grasping the breeding of chickens and pigs. The secretary of the farm's party committee and other responsible persons have recently moved to live near the pigsties and chicken coops to ensure the completion of the chicken and pig breeding plan.

The staff and workers of the 290 Military Reclamation Farm showed the heroic spirit of charging into battle on the battlefield in those years, and threshed all of the farm's more than 49,000 mu of wheat in four days. The later-stage field management of autumn crops has also achieved "going to the fields on cloudy days and not stopping on rainy days." The bricklaying team of the basic construction team of the general farm department increased the number of bricks laid per person per day from 2,000 to 3,000, and reached more than 4,100 on September 2nd, exceeding the quota by 86.9%. A total of 400 cadres and family members of the general farm department also actively participated in the work of transporting bricks, ensuring the transportation of 100,000 bricks within ten days, which can free up five cars to participate in other transportation work.

    农场工人干劲冲天夺超产
    广东一百三十个国营农场开荒种植热带经济作物
    合江垦区十四个农（牧）场决心完成粮食增产计划
    新华社广州10日电　广东省一百三十个国营农场的职工群众，正在千方百计地创造优异的增产节约成绩，向伟大的国庆十周年献礼。
    这些国营农场都以经营热带经济作物为主，结合发展多种经营。各农场的职工从8月初开始就制定国庆献礼规划，大鼓干劲，掀起增产节约运动高潮。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，职工们干劲更大，生产高潮越发高涨。许多农场职工晚上点起汽灯，赶着月亮，开荒种植热带经济作物，抢种秋植作物和果树。海南地区南茂、南平等四个农场，已经超额完成了全年的开荒种植任务。东方红农场的种植进度，以前平均每天仅二十一亩，目前已跃进到一百七十亩。海鸥农场每个劳动力每天收割香茅的数量，过去从未达到过八百斤的，现在这个农场第十队第三组全组职工却创造了平均每人收割八百零五斤的高纪录。这个场第一加工厂上半年的香茅出油率是1.42％，但是工人廖坡在党的号召的鼓舞下，大胆革新技术，创造了香茅出油率2.016％的成功经验。由于广大职工发挥冲天干劲，全省国营农场在8月份已经突击种下了各种果树三万一千多亩。各场职工们除了保证完成今年的果树种植和育苗计划以外，还提出平均每人增种香蕉等速生果树十株到三十株，向国庆十周年献礼。
    全省国营农场的畜禽饲养业，今年也出现了大跃进的局面。到8月底止，全省农场共计养猪十二万多头，超过全年饲养计划50％；鸡、鸭、鹅已发展到一百二十多万只，比去年年底结存数增加了十六倍多。在增产节约运动中，各场对这项生产抓得更紧，目前正继续扩种饲料，同时在饲养员中开展多管多养、管好养好的畜牧能手运动。湛江地区的国营农场职工还提出要在9、10两月内将畜禽生产翻一番的奋斗目标。许多农场抓紧了畜禽催肥工作，争取提早上市，更多地供应城市居民欢度国庆十周年。
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　黑龙江合江垦区十四个国营农（牧）场的二十万职工和家属，正以增产节约的实际行动响应党的号召，决心以最好的生产成就向国庆十周年献礼。
    以复员官兵和青年志愿垦荒队为主组成的萝北农场，十多万亩小麦已经收割完毕。职工们提出：要在脱粒中细打细收，保证每亩多收十斤粮食。他们还提出：要在加强大秋作物后期田间管理，力争每亩多增产二十斤到三十斤粮食。全场两千多人从党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以来，每天不停地在田间除草松土，促进庄稼早熟和籽粒饱满。8月27日到9月5日，全场已经拔完了八万亩秋田的大草。拖拉机正昼夜不停地在刚收完小麦的地上深翻，为明年继续跃进准备条件。
    宝泉岭农场职工，在保证农业增产的同时，正在大抓鸡、猪的饲养工作。农场党委书记和其他负责人最近都搬到猪圈鸡舍附近居住，保证完成鸡、猪的饲养计划。
    二九○军垦农场职工拿出了当年战场上冲锋陷阵的英勇气概，在四天中把全场四万九千多亩小麦全部脱完粒。大秋作物的后期田间管理，也作到了“阴天下地，雨天不停”。总场部基本建设队的砌砖小组，每人每天砌砖由二千块提高到三千块，9月2日达到了四千一百多块，超过定额86.9％。总场部的干部、家属共四百人，也主动地参加了运砖工作，保证十天内挑运砖十万块，可以腾出五台汽车参加其他运输工作。
