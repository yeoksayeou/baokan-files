    Mother-Son Heroes
    ——Watching the Film "The Hui Muslim Detachment"
    Ma Huiping
    The color feature film "The Hui Muslim Detachment," produced by the August First Film Studio, is China's first film reflecting how the Hui people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, embarked on the correct path of liberating themselves – uniting with all ethnic groups to resist Japan and strive for common liberation. Through the story of a Hui Muslim armed force in the North China Plain of Hebei Province growing into a people's revolutionary army under the leadership of the Party during the Anti-Japanese War, the film prominently depicts the correctness and greatness of the Party's anti-Japanese national united front and ethnic policies. Through the heroic deeds of the Hui Muslim Detachment and its leaders, Ma Benzhai and his mother, it vividly demonstrates the patriotism and heroic fighting spirit of the Hui people. This film is simple, colorful, and a film with high ideological and artistic value.
    After Japanese imperialism launched its war of aggression against China, it adopted the conspiracy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" politically, undermining internal unity, and using and expanding the contradictions between the Hui and Han nationalities at the time, carrying out a series of activities to provoke relations between the Hui and Han nationalities. The Hui people, like the Han people, suffered cruel trampling and massacres. At such a critical historical juncture, the Hui people, who were suffering from the triple oppression of Japanese imperialism, the Han chauvinism of the Kuomintang, and their own ethnic feudal forces, faced two diametrically opposed paths: one was the path of compromise, surrender, and national subjugation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which was the path taken by the Hui feudal upper-class surrenderists such as Bai Shouren and Ha Shaofu; the other was the path pointed out by the Chinese Communist Party, that is, all ethnic groups in the country should unite to resist Japan and seek common liberation, which was the path taken by Ma Benzhai and his mother, Li Maocai and his son, and Han Fushun and other Hui working people and patriotic upper-class figures. The struggle between these two paths is actually a reflection of the class struggle on the issue of the Anti-Japanese War. The path taken by Comrade Ma Benzhai in leading the Hui Muslim Detachment represents the correct path to the liberation of the Hui people and the Chinese nation. Because he realized that only by trusting the Communist Party could the complete liberation of his own nation and the Chinese nation be achieved. The Hui people followed this path pointed out by the Party, fought alongside the Han people and other ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party, and won the independence and freedom of the motherland and the liberation of all ethnic groups. I think the main reason why the film "The Hui Muslim Detachment" is so inspiring and leaves a deep impression is that the film closely grasps this main contradiction and describes the growth of the Hui Muslim Detachment from the struggle between the two paths. Through a series of issues such as joining the Eighth Route Army or surrendering to the Japanese invaders, accepting the leadership of the Party represented by Commissar Guo or rejecting the leadership of the Party, supporting the rent and interest reduction for farmers or cracking down on farmers' demands, and the relationship between officers and soldiers, the film unfolds the dramatic conflict between the two paths and the struggle between the old and new ideas between Ma Benzhai, Commissar Guo, and Li Maocai and Bai Shouren and Ha Shaofu in the unit, thus successfully portraying the growth process of the Hui Muslim Detachment and profoundly exposing the spiritual outlook of people of different classes, different ideas, and different personalities.
    The film's portrayal of the development of Ma Benzhai's thought is true and moving. The film shows us a righteous, brave, forthright, and firm anti-Japanese hero from Ma Benzhai's sad and indignant mood when he tore off the Japanese invaders' notice full of bullet holes and bloodstains, from his heroic action of taking the lead in the battlefield and pursuing the enemy's car on horseback, and from his angry rejection of the surrender attempt by Jin, the deputy officer of the Sixth Route Army who surrendered to the enemy. At the same time, from Ma Benzhai's old-fashioned military method of carrying a whip with him at all times to make soldiers blindly obey, from his connivance and indifference to the beating of soldiers, trampling on farmland, and collecting rent and debts by Bai Shouren, one of the original leading cadres of the troops, and especially from his initial attitude of gratitude and admiration for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, but also with national prejudice and personal arrogance and self-confidence, we are told that Ma Benzhai was still an old soldier who lacked class consciousness, lacked a true understanding of the Party and its policies, did not understand the relationship between the people's army and the masses of the people, and had certain national prejudices. Regarding the ideological development and growth of a character like Ma Benzhai, the film's screenwriter, director, and actors did not start from boring concepts, but wrote about the progress and changes in Ma Benzhai's ideological understanding from many details and from the development of internal contradictions. Through the Eighth Route Army's rescue, the debate about the troops joining the Eighth Route Army, Ma Benzhai's reading of Chairman Mao's works with a skeptical mood after arguing with Commissar Guo, from sympathizing with Bai Shouren to decisively executing Bai Shouren later, from the failure to mobilize soldiers to return to the team to the fact that soldiers who had deserted after the troops implemented the Party's policies returned to the team one after another, he gradually recognized the truth with the constant help of the Party, and finally became a conscious communist fighter. Therefore, Ma Benzhai in the film is a heroic figure with flesh and blood, who makes people feel kind and real.
    At the same time, the film portrays the great image of a selfless and devoted communist fighter, Commissar Guo. Commissar Guo was originally a regiment commander of the Eighth Route Army. He was heroically wounded while rescuing Ma Benzhai's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army from danger. After the Hui Muslim Detachment joined the Eighth Route Army, he was sent to serve as the political commissar of the Hui Muslim Detachment. He wholeheartedly implemented the Party's policies regardless of personal gains or losses, patiently helped Ma Benzhai and the Hui Muslim Detachment to make progress, and finally made Ma Benzhai gradually recognize the truth, and the Hui Muslim Detachment grew into a strong and truly people's army. The film's portrayal of the noble qualities of Commissar Guo, this model Communist Party member, is very moving. In order to implement the Party's ethnic policy, he seriously dealt with his guard, Xiao Liu, for violating discipline. In order to safeguard the interests of the masses, he engaged in a serious struggle with Bai Shouren. Regardless of Ma Benzhai's initial disrespect and even contempt for him, he always helped Ma Benzhai make progress with his own exemplary actions and patient persuasion and education. Although his wounded arm was still inflamed, he insisted on working; even after his arm was amputated, he was still full of confidence in fighting for the cause of the Party until he shed his last drop of blood in battle. He was humble and sincere, and never took credit. Although he lived with Ma Benzhai day and night, he did not let him know that he was the Regiment Commander Guo who rescued them. It was not until he was dying that Ma Benzhai understood. At this time, Ma Benzhai was overwhelmed with emotions and said in great pain: "Commissar, it's you! Why didn't you tell me earlier!" Commissar Guo replied: "Communist Party members, carry out the Party's tasks, what is there to tell people!" The glorious image of this great communist fighter is so admirable.
    Ma Benzhai's mother was a great mother. Her selfless sacrifice and unyielding spirit deeply moved all the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in central Hebei at that time and inspired the anti-Japanese will of the people in central Hebei. When all walks of life in Yan'an mourned Ma Benzhai in 1944, Commander-in-Chief Zhu wrote a eulogy: "Lofty aspirations are hard to change, a model for the Han and Hui ethnic groups; great integrity never dies, a hero of two generations, mother and son," which summarized the glorious life of his mother and son. Although the film does not portray Ma's mother very much, the portrayal is very detailed, leaving a deep impression on the image of this kind, amiable, and great mother who would rather be a shattered jade than a whole tile.
    I think there are two shortcomings in the film: First, although the unparalleled enthusiasm and determination of the Hui people to heroically resist Japan during the Anti-Japanese War came from their hatred of the Japanese invaders for invading their motherland, the main reason was that the Party's ethnic policies were correctly implemented in the anti-Japanese base areas, and the political and economic status of the Hui people had undergone tremendous changes, enjoying full equal rights. Although the film has a prominent description of the Party's ethnic policies in the troops, reflecting the Party's ethnic policies from the changes in the political and economic status of the Hui people in the base areas makes people feel very insufficient. Second, the fundamental reason why the Hui people's armed forces behind enemy lines were able to develop and grow, in addition to the Party's leadership and the correctness of the Party's policies, was the unity of the Hui and Han commanders and fighters in the Hui armed forces and the love and help of the Han people. When the Japanese invaders searched for Ma Benzhai's mother in the autumn of 1941, the Han people in Dongxing Village, such as Wang Zhaoxi, used their lives to protect Ma's mother's safety. There were many vivid examples of unity and mutual assistance between the Hui and Han people in the Hui Muslim troops and the base areas. Unfortunately, the film lacks necessary and powerful descriptions in this important ethnic relationship.
    Despite this, on the whole, "The Hui Muslim Detachment" is still an excellent and educational film. For the Hui people and other ethnic groups who have already been liberated and are living a happy life today, it will make us love our great Party, our great motherland, and love our life today even more, and encourage people of all ethnic groups to unite more closely and work harder to build our country.

    母子英雄
    ——看影片“回民支队”
    马惠平
    八一电影制片厂摄制的彩色故事片“回民支队”是我国第一部反映回族人民在中国共产党领导下走上解放自己的正确道路——与各族人民团结抗日，争取共同解放的影片。影片通过抗日战争中在华北冀中平原上一支回民武装在党的领导下成长为人民革命军队的故事，突出地描写了党的抗日民族统一战线和民族政策的正确和伟大；通过回民支队及其领导人马本斋母子的英雄事迹，生动地表现了回民的爱国主义和英勇战斗的精神。这部电影朴素、多采，是一部思想性和艺术性都比较高的影片。
    日本帝国主义对我国发动侵略战争后，一方面在政治上采取“以华制华”的阴谋，破坏我国内部的团结，利用和扩大当时回、汉民族间的矛盾，进行一系列的挑拨回、汉民族关系的活动；回族人民和汉族人民一样，遭受着惨酷的蹂躏和屠杀。在这样严重的历史关头，身受日本帝国主义、国民党大汉族主义和本民族封建势力三重压迫的回族人民面前，摆着两条截然不同的道路：一条是国民党反动派的妥协投降、亡国灭族的道路，这是影片里白守仁、哈少福等回族封建上层投降分子所走的道路；另一条是中国共产党指出的，全国各民族团结抗日、共求解放的道路，这是影片里马本斋母子、李茂才父子和韩福顺等回族劳动人民和爱国上层人士所走的道路。这两条道路的斗争，实际上是阶级斗争在抗日战争问题上的反映。马本斋同志领导回民支队所走的道路，代表着回族人民和中华民族解放的正确道路。因为，他认识了只有信赖共产党才能完成自己民族以及中华民族的彻底解放。回族人民正是遵循着党所指出的这条道路，在党的领导下，和汉族以及其它各民族人民共同战斗，争得祖国的独立、自由和各民族的解放。我认为影片“回民支队”所以能够激动人心，给人留下深刻的印象，最主要的原因，就是影片紧紧地抓住了这个主要矛盾，从两条道路的斗争中来描写回民支队的成长。通过参加八路军还是投降日寇，接受以郭政委为代表的党的领导还是拒绝党的领导，是支持农民的减租减息还是打击农民的要求以及官兵关系等一系列的问题上，展开了部队中马本斋、郭政委、李茂才同白守仁、哈少福之间的两条道路和新旧思想斗争的戏剧性冲突，从而成功地刻划了回民支队的成长过程，深刻地揭露了不同阶级、不同思想、不同性格的人底精神面貌。
    影片对马本斋思想发展的刻划是真实动人的。影片从马本斋撕下满是弹痕血迹的日寇布告时的悲愤心情，从他在战场上身先士卒单骑追击敌人汽车的英勇行动，从他对投敌的六路军金副官诱降的愤怒拒绝，在我们面前展现出了一个正直、勇敢、豪爽、坚定的抗日英雄。同时，又从马本斋随时带着一根皮鞭要士兵盲目服从的旧军人带兵的方法，从他对部队原来的领导骨干之一的地主白守仁打骂士兵，践踏农田、摧租要债等行为的迁就和漠不关心，特别是从他起初对共产党、八路军既是感激敬佩又带着民族偏见和个人的刚愎自信的态度等方面，又告诉我们马本斋还是一个缺乏阶级觉悟，对党和党的政策还缺乏真正认识，不懂得人民军队和人民群众的关系，有着一定民族偏见的旧军人。对于马本斋这样一个人物的思想的发展和成长，影片的剧作者、导演和演员不是从枯燥的概念出发，而是从许多细节、从内心矛盾发展中写出了马本斋思想认识的进步和变化。通过八路军解围，部队参加八路军的争论，马本斋同郭政委争论后用怀疑的心情阅读毛主席著作，从同情白守仁到后来当机立断处决白守仁，动员战士归队失败到部队执行党的政策后开小差的战士纷纷归队等一系列的事件，写出了他如何在党的不断帮助下逐渐认识真理，终于成为自觉的共产主义战士。因此，影片中的马本斋是一个有血有肉、使人感到亲切真实的英雄人物。
    同时影片塑造了一位舍身忘我的共产主义战士——郭政委的伟大形象。郭政委原来是八路军的一个团长，他在援救马本斋抗日义勇队脱险时英勇负伤，回民支队参加八路军后，他被派担任回民支队的政委。他不顾个人得失忠心耿耿地贯彻执行党的政策，耐心地帮助马本斋和回民支队进步，终于使马本斋逐步认识了真理，回民支队成长为一支坚强的真正的人民军队。影片对郭政委这位模范共产党员的崇高品质的刻划十分动人。他为了执行党的民族政策，严肃处理了他的警卫员小刘违反纪律的行为。他为了维护群众的利益，严肃地和白守仁展开了斗争。他不管马本斋开始对他的不尊重，甚至看不起，而一直以自己的模范行动和耐心的说服教育，帮助马本斋进步。尽管他负伤的胳膊还在发炎，但他一直坚持工作；胳膊被切除后，也仍然信心百倍地为党的事业奋斗，直到在战斗中流尽最后一滴血。他待人谦虚诚恳，从不居功，虽然和马本斋朝夕相处，却没有让他知道自己就是给他们解围的郭团长。直到临牺牲时，马本斋才明白。这时马本斋百感交集，痛苦万分地说：“政委，是你！为什么不早告诉我！”郭政委的回答是：“共产党员，执行党的任务，有什么值得告诉人的！”这位伟大的共产主义战士的光辉形象，多么令人敬爱。
    马本斋的母亲是一位伟大的母亲，她的舍身成仁，宁死不屈的伟大事迹，在当时深深感动了冀中所有的抗日军民，鼓舞了冀中人民的抗日意志。1944年延安各界追悼马本斋时，朱总司令写的挽联：“壮志难移，汉回各族模范；大节不死，母子两代英雄”，总结了他母子光辉的一生。影片虽然对马母没作很多的描写，刻划却很细致，使这位慈祥可亲，宁为玉碎、不为瓦全的伟大母性的形象，给人留下了深深的印象。
    影片美中不足的地方，我认为有两点：第一，抗日战争中回族人民英勇抗战的无比热情和决心，虽然是来自对日寇侵略祖国的仇恨，但主要的还是由于各抗日根据地正确地贯澈了党的民族政策，回族人民的政治、经济地位已经发生了巨大的变化，享受了充分的平等权利。影片对党在部队里的民族政策虽有突出的描写，但是从根据地回族人民政治、经济地位的变化方面反映党的民族政策就使人觉得十分不够。第二，敌后回族人民武装所以能够得到发展和壮大，除了党的领导和党的政策正确以外，还有一个根本的原因，就是回族武装部队中回、汉指战员的团结和得到汉族人民的热爱和帮助。日寇在1941年秋搜捕马本斋母亲时，东幸庄的汉族人民像王兆喜等都曾用自己的生命掩护马母的安全，在回民部队和根据地里有许多回、汉人民团结互助的生动事例。可惜影片在这一重要的民族关系方面，缺乏必要的有力的描写。
    虽然如此，但总起来说，“回民支队”仍是一部优秀的富有教育意义的影片。对于我们今天已经获得解放并过着幸福生活的回族人民和其他各族人民来说，它会使我们更加热爱我们伟大的党、伟大的祖国，热爱我们今天的生活，鼓舞各民族人民更加团结、更加努力地建设我们的国家。
