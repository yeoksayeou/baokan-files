	Study Science, Increase Production
	Xiaoyi Commune Determined to Study Projects Such as Close Planting, Fertilization, and Crop Rotation
	Fenghuo Commune Conducted Forty-Four Scientific Experiments
	This Dispatch: Over the past year, Xiaoyi People's Commune in Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, has achieved great success in leading mass scientific and technological activities.
	After the establishment of the Xiaoyi People's Commune, it attached great importance to agricultural scientific research. First, it established a Science and Technology Association and established six specialized scientific research groups, including tool reform, soil, fertilizer, improved seed breeding, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and medicine. Production brigades also established professional research groups. Now, more than 1,200 people in the commune have joined the Science and Technology Association. These activists who love science and technology are actively carrying out scientific and technological research and popularizing scientific knowledge on all fronts of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery.
	The main projects studied and tested by the commune this year include planting density, variety comparison, fertilization, irrigation technology, field management, crop rotation methods, and crop hybridization. Currently, the commune has established 16 agricultural experiment groups and is using 310 mu of land for experimental activities.
	During the period of the advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, due to the small size of the cooperatives, the comprehensive promotion of improved varieties was often subject to many restrictions, and it was particularly impossible to transfer specialized personnel to engage in improved seed experimentation and research. After the establishment of the commune, the boundaries between cooperatives were broken, creating favorable conditions for the comprehensive realization of improved varieties. In addition to organizing more than 5,300 people to carry out improved seed selection activities, the Xiaoyi Commune also transferred some labor to form 181 improved seed research groups. These research groups cultivated a large number of high-quality varieties of rice, corn, cotton, and soybeans. In order to promote these high-quality varieties, they also cooperated with the seed selection movement to hold on-site meetings, organize visits, and hold technical discussions to widely disseminate scientific and technical knowledge such as the selection and storage of high-quality varieties. At present, the whole commune has selected 1.2 million jin of high-quality varieties.
	Mass scientific and technological activities have also promoted the agricultural tool reform movement. From the summer of last year to the present, the commune has reformed and created 4,181 new tools such as plows, drills, harrows, sweet potato slicers, and carts. These production tools have played a positive role in improving labor productivity. This year, after the promotion of close-planting drills and a light and improved plow, the rational close planting of three wheat crops was realized.
	The commune's scientific research organization made full use of local resources to produce various indigenous pesticides and fertilizers. In order to ensure the quality of these products, the commune established a soil and fertilizer research group, which extensively conducted research on raw material performance, mixing, and usage methods. Over the past year, the commune has produced more than 2 million jin of phosphate bacteria fertilizer, nitrogen-fixing bacteria fertilizer, and shell powder, and more than 120 jin of indigenous pesticides.
	Over the past year, the commune has run 231 technical training classes, with more than 5,100 people participating regularly. These training classes all adopted a combination of classroom and field, and a combination of books and practice. In order to meet the scientific and technical learning needs of the commune members, the commune also compiled and printed 29 kinds of management technology textbooks for various crops in various periods.

	This Dispatch: More than 70% of the members of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, participated in various scientific experiments and learned new agricultural technologies, which strongly promoted the development of agricultural production.
	The commune, with the agricultural technical school as the main body, allocated more than 140 mu of land as scientific experimental fields, and at the same time established a meteorological station and added various experimental instruments. This year, forty-four scientific experiments were carried out on these lands, including variety trials of various crops; reform trials of farming systems; high-yield trials of various crops; and fertilizer and irrigation trials. In the variety trials, more than 140 kinds of wheat, 32 kinds of cotton, and 42 kinds of corn were planted, including local and foreign, domestic and foreign, multi-eared corn and colored cotton, as well as high-yielding, drought-resistant, and cold-resistant varieties. They also used these varieties with different characteristics to conduct sexual and asexual hybridization experiments to cultivate new varieties. Among the above-mentioned varieties, twenty-three varieties were selected or hybridized by themselves. In terms of the farming system, experiments were also conducted on planting forms such as convex ridges, flat ridges, heaps, terraces, round heaps, and sun-slope types; there were intercropping experiments of various crops, etc. Through these scientific experiments, the purpose is to solve the problems of high-yield technology of crop varieties and fields.
	The People's Commune not only provided favorable conditions for scientific research but also facilitated the promotion of advanced experience. Last year, under the unified guidance of the Scientific Committee, advanced experience was widely promoted. The most prominent is wheat. Last year, the commune planted more than 68,000 mu of wheat, universally implemented rational close planting, and all wheat fields were ploughed seven or eight inches deep. Other improvements were made in fertilization and field management. Therefore, this year's wheat has achieved a bumper harvest; advanced experience has also been widely promoted in cotton and corn fields, such as the widespread implementation of wide and narrow rows in terrace planting, and the widespread implementation of pest control and pruning.
	The Fenghuo Commune was formed by the merger of thirty-one agricultural cooperatives. In the past, most agricultural cooperatives did not have scientific experimental organizations and experimental fields. Shortly after the establishment of the commune, each team had high-yield experimental organizations and various high-yield experimental fields. These high-yield fields occupy a lot of land, and many people participate, including elderly high-yield fields, women's high-yield fields, youth high-yield fields, and Young Pioneer high-yield fields. These high-yield fields have all achieved good harvests. (With pictures)

    研究科学  增加生产
    小伊公社确定研究密植施肥轮作等项目
    烽火公社进行了四十四项科学试验工作
    本报讯　一年来，江苏省灌云县小伊人民公社在领导群众性的科学技术活动方面已取得了巨大的成绩。
    小伊人民公社建立以后，十分重视农业科学的研究工作，首先成立了科学技术协会，建立了工具改革、土壤、肥料、良种繁育、畜牧兽医、医学等六个专门科学研究小组。各生产大队也分别建立了专业研究小组。现在全公社已有一千二百多人加入了科学技术协会。这些爱好科学技术的积极分子，在农林牧副渔等各个战线上积极地开展了科学技术研究工作和普及科学知识的活动。
    这个公社在今年研究试验的主要项目有密植程度、品种比较、施肥、灌溉技术、田间管理、轮作方法以及作物杂交等。现在全公社共建立了十六个农业试验小组，并用三百一十亩土地来进行试验活动。
    高级社时期，由于社小，全面推广良种常常受到很多限制，特别无法抽调专门人员从事良种试验研究工作。建立公社后，打破了社与社之间的界线，为全面实现良种化带来了有利条件。小伊公社除组织五千三百多人开展了良种选种运动外，还抽调部分劳动力组成了一百八十一个良种研究小组，这些研究组大量培育了水稻、玉米、棉花、大豆等优良品种。为了普遍推广这些优良品种，还配合选种运动，召开现场会议、组织参观、召开技术讨论会，广泛地传播了优良品种的选种、保管等科学技术知识。目前，全社已经选出了优良品种一百二十万斤。
    群众性的科学技术活动还推动了农具改革运动。这个公社从去年夏季到现在，共改制和创造了犁、耩、耙、山芋切片机、小车等四千一百八十一件新工具。这些生产工具在提高劳动生产率上起了积极的作用。今年推广了密植耩子和一种轻便的改良犁后，实现了三麦的合理密植。
    公社的科学研究组织充分利用当地的资源，制成了各种土农药和土化肥。为了保证这些产品的质量，公社成立了土壤肥料研究组，广泛地进行了原料性能、配料、使用方法等项研究工作。一年来，全社共制成了磷细菌肥、固氮菌肥、贝壳粉等二百多万斤，此外还制成了一百二十多斤土农药。
    公社一年来办了二百三十一个技术学习班，定期参加学习的人达五千一百多人。这些学习班都是采取课堂与田头相结合、书本与实践相结合的办法进行的。为了满足社员的科学技术学习，公社还编印了二十九种农作物在各个时期的管理技术课本。（江苏科协）
    本报讯　陕西省乾县烽火人民公社70％以上的社员参加了各种科学试验和学习新的农业技术，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。
    这个公社以农业技术学校为主，拨了一百四十多亩土地，作为科学试验田，同时建立了气象站，添置了各种试验仪器。今年，在这些土地上，进行了四十四项科学试验工作，其中有各种农作物的品种试验；耕作制度的改革试验；各种作物的高额丰产试验以及肥料、灌溉等试验工作。在品种试验方面，共种植了一百四十多种小麦、三十二种棉花、四十二种玉米，包括本地的和外地的，本国的和外国的，有多穗玉米和有色棉花，也有高产的、耐旱的、耐寒的品种，他们还利用这些具有不同特点的品种，进行有性的和无性的杂交试验，培育新的品种。在上述的各种品种中有二十三个品种是他们自己选出来的或杂交成的。在耕作制度方面也进行了凸垅、平垅、堆状、梯状、圆堆、阳坡式等种植形式的试验；有各种作物的套种试验等。通过这些科学试验，目的在于解决农作物品种和大田的丰产技术问题。
    人民公社不仅给科学研究工作提供了有利条件，而且有利于推广先进经验。去年，在科学委员会统一指导下，先进经验得到普遍推广。最突出的是小麦，去年全社共种六万八千多亩小麦，普遍地实行了合理密植，全部麦地都翻耕七、八寸深，其它如施肥、田间管理等工作都有改进，因此，今年小麦获得大丰收；在棉花、玉米地里也普遍推行先进经验，例如梯田播种普遍的实行宽窄行，普遍地进行防虫、整枝等工作。
    烽火公社是由三十一个农业社合并成的，过去多数农业社没有科学试验组织和试验田，公社成立不久就达到了队队都有丰产试验组织和各种丰产试验田。这些丰产田占地很多，参加的人也很多，有老人丰产田、妇女丰产田、青年丰产田、红领巾丰产田等。这些丰产田都取得了很好的收成。（附图片）
