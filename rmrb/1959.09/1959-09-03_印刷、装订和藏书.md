    Printing, Binding, and Book Collecting
    Advocating reading, everyone wants to buy some good books, and good books should be well-preserved.
    I don't have a large collection, but even the few I have, displayed on my desk, come in dozens of sizes, high and low, big and small. For example, "Imperialism and Chinese Politics" is wider than "All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," but the latter is longer than the former. Also, the hardcover and paperback editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are different sizes. These unevenly sized books are difficult to store and don't look good on display. They also cause a lot of inconvenience when packing for travel or mailing. Therefore, it is necessary for the publishing industry to standardize the size specifications of publications. Whether it's theoretical books, literary books, science and technology books, children's books, hardcover books, paperback books, dictionaries, or encyclopedias... all should be stipulated in three to four unified sizes. For example: magazines in 16mo; theoretical and textbooks in 32mo; children's books and pocket editions all in 64mo, and ensure that 16mo equals 32mo times two equals 64mo times four. If this is unified nationwide, there will be no worry about storing books when buying them. That is point one.
    Secondly, there is a lot of repetition in the printing of theoretical books and articles. This unit compiles a book, and that department publishes a collection. You compile and print loose-leaf selected works, and I publish an anthology. The names are different, but the content is repetitive. Some booklets contain a considerable portion that has already been published by others, with only a small portion being newly compiled. This makes it difficult for readers to decide whether to buy or not, and it also wastes manpower and resources. In order to save paper and manpower, and to consider the readers, the publishing industry should also unify planning and arrangements.

    印刷、装订和藏书
    提倡读书，谁都想买几本好书，好书就要好好收藏。
    我藏书不多，但很少的几本，陈列在书案上也是高高低低、大大小小不下数十种尺码。如“帝国主义与中国政治”比“一切帝国主义和反动派都是纸老虎”宽，而后者却比前者长，又如“毛泽东选集”精装本和简装本大小也不一样，这样参参差差的书卷，不好收藏，陈列也不美观，特别是在旅行装箱和邮递时，更诸多不便。为此，出版界统一出版物尺码的规格，是很必要的。无论理论书、文艺书、科技书、大人书、小人书、精装本、简装本、字典、辞源……通通规定三至四种统一尺码，比如说：杂志十六开；理论、教科书等三十二开，小人书、袖珍本一律六十四开，并使十六开本等于三十二开本乘二等于六十四开本乘四，全国统一起来，买书就不愁藏书了，这是一。
    其次，理论书籍文章印刷重复较多，这个单位编一本，那个部门出一辑，你编印活叶文选，我出版社论选集，名目不同，内容重复。有的小册子相当一部分都是别人已经出版过了的，只有一少部分是新编，买与不买，使读者为难，也浪费了人力物力。为了节约纸张人力，为读者着想，出版界也应统一筹划安排。
