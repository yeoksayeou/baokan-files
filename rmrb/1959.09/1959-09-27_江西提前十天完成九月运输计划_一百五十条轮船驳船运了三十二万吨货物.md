Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 24th—The workers of the Jiangxi Province shipping system overfulfilled the September and third-quarter transportation plans ten days ahead of schedule. By the 20th, a total of 150 steamers and barges in the province had transported more than 320,000 tons of goods, with the highest single day reaching more than 74,000 tons. Now, the workers are advancing victoriously, striving to complete 90% of the annual transportation plan by the end of September, as a gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.
    Jiangxi is mostly mountainous, and inland river shipping accounts for 60% of the province's total freight volume. The 150 or so steamers and barges directly controlled by the shipping department account for one-third of the total shipping volume. Many folk transportation tools transport materials from mountain tributaries, and these steamers and barges are responsible for transferring them. In September, the inland waterways entered the dry season, and the efficiency of port loading and unloading was low, bringing certain difficulties to the shipping department. However, various departments requested the transportation of 300,000 tons of goods, which required the average daily transportation volume to increase from the original 7,000 tons to 10,000 tons. In order to successfully complete this task, ships and ships, ports and stations, factories and factories have launched an increase production and practice economy campaign centered on high output, high quality, and low consumption, so that the work efficiency of each link has been rapidly improved. The workers of Ganlun 306 and 303 completed the third quarter transportation tasks 20 days ahead of schedule. In early September, the Nanchang Machine Repair Shop rushed to repair twelve ships docked in the port and completed the manufacture of hundreds of spare parts. Jiujiang, Nanchang Station and other units implemented measures such as delivering fuel and crew supplies to the ships, which greatly reduced the berthing time of the ships.
    In the competition, the workers carried out technical innovation and promoted advanced experience. The workers on the Binhu and Ganjiang routes promoted advanced experience such as ship pushing, which generally increased the speed by about 15%, and up to 44% at most. Some ships of the Fourth Shipping Brigade in southern Jiangxi promoted the burning of white coal mixed with water, which saved about 10% of fuel compared with the past. All localities also seized the key links in transportation to improve enterprise management and improve transportation capacity.

    江西提前十天完成九月运输计划
    一百五十条轮船驳船运了三十二万吨货物
    新华社南昌24日电　江西省航运系统职工提前十天超额完成了9月份和第三季度的运输计划。到20日止，全省一百五十条轮船驳船一共运了三十二万多吨货物，最高的一天达到七万四千多吨。现在，职工们正乘胜前进，争取在9月底完成全年运输计划的90％，向建国十周年献礼。
    江西多山，内河航运担负的运量占全省的60％，而由航运部门直接掌握的一百五十多条轮船驳船的运量，又占全部航运量的三分之一，许多民间运输工具从山区支流运出来的物资，都要靠这些轮船驳船转运。9月份，内河航道已届枯水期，港口装卸效率低，给航运部门带来了一定的困难。但是各部门要求运输的货物却有三十万吨，这就要求平均日运量由原来的七千吨提高到一万吨。为了顺利完成这一任务，船舶与船舶、港站与港站、厂所与厂所，纷纷展开以高产、优质、低耗为中心的增产节约竞赛，使各个环节的工作效率都迅速提高。赣轮三零六、三零三的职工，提前二十天完成了第三季度运输任务。南昌机修所在9月上旬赶修了十二艘停港船舶，同时完成了几百件配件的制造任务。九江、南昌站等单位实行燃料、船员生活资料送上船等办法，大大减少了船舶停港时间。
    竞赛中，职工大闹技术革新，推广先进经验。在滨湖、赣江航线的职工，推广了船舶顶推等先进经验，一般提高航速15％左右，最高达44％。赣南第四船舶大队部分船舶推行了白煤掺水燃烧，较过去节约燃料10％左右。各地还抓住运输中的关键环节改进企业管理，提高了运输力。
