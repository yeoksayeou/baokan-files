Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory Holds All-Night Swearing-in and Skills Competition
    Determined to Complete the Year's Plan Three Months Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Chengdu dispatch, September 1) On the evening of August 26th, when the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were broadcast, more than 5,000 workers at the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory held an all-night swearing-in and skills competition, determined to complete the year's national plan one quarter ahead of schedule.

    This factory officially went into production in 1958. At that time, there was a lack of experience in all aspects of the work, and more than 80% of the workers were new workers with less than three years of service. However, under the brilliant light of the General Line, the Party Committee vigorously launched mass movements. It was originally stipulated that it would take four years to reach the designed production capacity, but it was achieved in one year, and the total output value exceeded the designed annual output by 107.76%. From January of this year to August 26th, indicators such as total output value, output, quality, cost, and labor productivity have comprehensively exceeded the level of the entire year of last year. Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, the factory's profits turned over to the state in the seventeen months from January of last year to May of this year offset all the factory's construction investment used by the state. Since August, each workshop has mobilized the masses to discuss targets, tap potential, and add measures, and has set off a new upsurge in production. The August production plan was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded by the 22nd. These are all favorable conditions for completing the annual national plan one quarter ahead of schedule.

    In order to realize the leap forward plan for the next four months, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory decided to mobilize the masses to continue to carry out the high-yield and high-quality movement in depth and comprehensively improve the level of production. The biggest difficulty for this factory to achieve a continued great leap forward in production is the insufficient quantity of materials and the incomplete variety and specifications, but this factory has gained rich experience in overcoming the above difficulties. Their method is self-reliance. After trying every means to improve technology, in the past, the factory's workers could only process forty types of steel grades, but now they have mastered the processing performance of one hundred types of steel grades. At present, for measuring tools alone, after various tests, nearly half of the materials have been replaced with low-carbon alloy steel instead of alloy tool steel. These products have been identified and the quality is completely in line with design requirements. Without affecting national equipment and resource allocation principles, the factory has self-made equipment, transferred labor, and used local resources to establish satellite factories for steelmaking, grinding wheels, cement, and other services for the production of measuring tools and cutting tools. The steelmaking branch guarantees to produce at least one thousand tons of steel in the next four months.

    In order to ensure that the workers are energetic in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the factory pays great attention to arranging the workers' lives. In addition to revising various reward systems, the factory actively tries to enrich the cultural activities of the workers, and also raises pigs to improve food. Some workshop leaders go deep into the workers' dormitories to understand their living conditions and take the initiative to help solve problems. Management cadres organized amateur service teams to deliver boiled water to the workers, clean the canteen, and help the cooks sell meals, encouraging the workers to further improve production.

### 成都量具刃具厂连夜誓师大比武  决心提前三月完成全年计划

    成都量具刃具厂连夜誓师大比武
    决心提前三月完成全年计划
    本报成都1日电　8月26日广播出中共八届八中全会公报和决议的当晚，成都量具刃具厂五千多职工连夜举行了誓师比武大会，决心提前一个季度完成今年的国家计划。
    这个厂在1958年正式投入生产，当时各方面的工作都缺乏经验，80％以上的工人是不满三年工龄的新工人，但是在总路线光辉照耀下，党委大搞群众运动，原来规定四年达到设计生产能力，结果一年就实现了，而且生产总值超过设计年产量107.76％。今年到8月26日止，生产总值、产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率等指标又全面超过了去年全年的水平。由于认真贯彻了勤俭办企业的方针，从去年1月到今年5月的十七个月中，工厂上缴的利润就抵偿了国家用于这个工厂的全部建厂投资。8月份以来，各车间发动群众讨论指标，挖潜力，添措施，又掀起了一个新的生产高潮。8月份生产计划到22日就提前超额完成了。这都是提前一个季度完成全年国家计划的有利条件。
    为了实现今后四个月的跃进计划，成都量具刃具厂决定发动群众继续深入开展高产优质运动，全面提高生产水平。这个厂实现生产继续大跃进的最大困难是材料数量不足，品种、规格不全，但是这个厂在克服上述困难方面已经取得了丰富的经验。他们的办法是自力更生。经过千方百计改进技术，过去全厂工人只能加工四十种钢号，现在已能掌握一百种钢号的加工性能了。目前仅量具产品，经过各种试验，已有将近一半材料用低炭合金钢代替了合金工具钢，这些产品经过鉴定，质量完全合乎设计要求。在不影响国家设备和资源分配的原则下，工厂自制了设备，调剂了劳动力，利用当地资源开办了为量具刃具生产服务的炼钢、砂轮、水泥等卫星工厂。炼钢分厂保证在今后四个多月中至少生产一千吨钢。
    为了保证职工们在增产节约运动中精力充沛，这个厂很注意安排职工生活。除修订各种奖励制度外，工厂积极设法充实职工的文化活动，并且养猪改善伙食。有的车间领导干部深入职工宿舍了解生活情况，主动帮助解决问题。管理干部组织了业余服务队，给工人送开水，打扫食堂，帮助炊事员售饭，鼓舞工人进一步搞好生产。
