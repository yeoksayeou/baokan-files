Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 12th: Southern Fujian Province's Jinjiang and Longxi regions have experienced consecutive days of heavy rain, resulting in the largest flood since the beginning of the flood season this year. The broad masses of people, who have continuously battled typhoon storms and tidal surges, are now rising up to engage in flood fighting.

The typhoon that landed on the eastern coast of Guangdong entered southern Fujian on the 11th. Due to the typhoon's influence, heavy rain fell across Fujian on the 10th and 11th. Rainfall in the Jinjiang and Longxi regions exceeded 150 to 200 millimeters, with some areas approaching 300 millimeters. After the rain, mountain torrents erupted, and the water levels of the Jiulong River, Jinjiang River, Xiahe River, and other rivers exceeded the warning level by more than two meters. Due to the heavy and rapid rainfall and the swift and fierce flood crest, the rivers could not discharge the water in time. Counties and cities along the Jiulong River, Zhangjiang River, and Jinjiang River basins, such as Nan'an, Zhangzhou, Longxi, Yunxiao, and Quanzhou, were surrounded by floods, and in some places, the floodwaters entered urban areas. Nan'an County town was surrounded by floodwaters from 10 p.m. on the 10th, with water accumulating more than one meter deep in the streets. Many villages and farmlands were inundated, and wooden boats were washed away.

On the night of the 10th, when the typhoon affected southern Fujian and heavy rain occurred, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China urgently instructed Party committees at all levels to mobilize the masses to bravely resist the rain and floods. On the 11th, the Provincial Committee held an emergency meeting, demanding that all localities immediately strengthen leadership in the flood fight. The main area affected by the heavy rain and floods this time – the middle and lower reaches of the Jiulong River – under the strong leadership of the Party committee, had successively overcome multiple attacks from rainstorms, floods, typhoons and other disasters since the summer of this year. The Provincial Committee instructed all localities to continue to carry forward the heroic and tenacious spirit of past disaster relief struggles, strengthen upper and lower level communication along the rivers, cooperate with each other, and carry out the disaster relief struggle to the end. The Longxi and Jinjiang Regional Committees and the relevant county committees held emergency meetings one after another and dispatched a large number of cadres. Responsible cadres of the Regional Committee and other related officials rushed to the disaster areas overnight to lead the flood fight. On the 11th, the Longxi Regional Committee, Zhangzhou municipal agencies, and enterprises suspended office and business operations to devote themselves to the flood fight. Counties and people's communes organized large numbers of cadres and masses to form patrol teams and rescue teams to protect and rescue the people's lives and property. (Attached picture)

    福建南部地区连日暴雨成灾
    群众奋勇抗洪抢险
    据新华社福州12日电　福建省晋江、龙溪专区连日暴雨，出现今年入汛以来的最大的一次洪水。连续战胜台风暴雨和大潮袭击的广大人民，现在又奋起投入抗洪斗争。
    由广东东部沿海登陆的台风，11日进入福建南部地区。由于台风的影响，10日和11日福建各地普降暴雨，晋江和龙溪两专区降雨量都在一百五十毫米到二百毫米以上，雨量最大的地方接近三百毫米。雨后山洪暴发，九龙江、晋江、下河等江河水位都超过警戒水位两米多。由于暴雨下的大而急，洪峰来得快而猛，江河排泄不及，位于九龙江、漳江、晋江流域的南靖、漳州、龙溪、云霄和泉州等县市，被洪水围困，有些地方洪水进入城区。南靖县城自10日晚十时起即被洪水包围，街道积水一米多深。许多村庄农田被淹，木船被漂走。
    10日夜里，台风波及闽南和发生暴雨时，中共福建省委便紧急指示各级党委发动群众奋起抗雨抗洪。11日省委又召开紧急会议，要求各地立即加强抗洪斗争的领导。这次受到暴雨洪水袭击的主要地区——九龙江中下游一带，在党委坚强领导下，从今年夏季以来曾先后战胜了多次暴雨、洪水、台风等灾害的袭击。省委指示各地要继续发扬过去历次抗灾斗争的英勇顽强精神，加强各江河沿线的上下联系，互相协作，把抗灾斗争进行到底。龙溪、晋江地委和各有关县委，连续召开紧急会议，派出大批干部，地委和有关负责干部也漏夜赶赴灾区，领导抗洪斗争。11日，龙溪地委和漳州市机关、企业都停止办公和营业，投入了抗洪斗争。各县和各人民公社都组织大批干部群众，成立巡逻队、抢救队，保护和抢救人民的生命财产。（附图片）
