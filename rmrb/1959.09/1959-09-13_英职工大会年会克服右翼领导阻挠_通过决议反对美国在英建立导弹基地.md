    British Trades Union Congress Annual Meeting Overcomes Right-Wing Leadership Obstruction, Passes Resolution Against U.S. Establishing Missile Bases in Britain
    (By our London correspondent, Su Lan) The 91st Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress, which began on the 7th in Blackpool, concluded on the 11th. The annual meeting passed a resolution "opposing the British government's allowing the U.S. to establish missile bases in Britain" by a vote of 4,040,000 to 3,865,000. It reflects the strong feelings of the broad masses of the British people against the U.S. war policy and their urgent desire for the easing of international tensions.
    On the agenda of this annual meeting, in addition to issues such as wages and working conditions, the issue of nuclear weapons became the overriding focus.
    Even before this annual meeting, sharp debates on the issue of nuclear weapons had unfolded within the British Labour Party and trade union organizations. On the one hand, the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress had jointly proposed the so-called "Non-Nuclear Club" plan. This plan advocated that Britain "cease manufacturing and possessing nuclear weapons" on the condition that all countries other than the Soviet Union and the United States agree not to possess nuclear weapons. In reality, it was, under the guise of Britain conditionally "ceasing manufacturing and possessing nuclear weapons," an endorsement of the British government's current policy. This meant supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and supporting the U.S. nuclear deterrence policy. On the other hand, the ordinary workers of Britain, represented by the Transport and General Workers' Union, which has 1.3 million members, demanded that Britain unilaterally stop testing and manufacturing nuclear weapons and abolish the U.S. missile bases in Britain. These two diametrically opposed opinions marked the sharp antagonism between the ordinary workers of Britain and the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party and the trade unions.
    In addition to passing the resolution against the U.S. bases, the annual meeting also passed, by an absolute majority of 5,410,000 votes, a resolution proposed by the National Union of Vehicle Builders opposing the nuclear arming of West Germany. The resolution stated: "The Trades Union Congress opposes the nuclear armament of West Germany, demands that the major powers hold negotiations on resolving the Berlin issue without the use of force or the threat of force, and advocates that representatives from both East and West Germany participate in the talks." However, the proposal put forward by the Transport and General Workers' Union, demanding that Britain stop testing and manufacturing nuclear weapons, was rejected under the manipulation of right-wing trade union leaders.
    This has left the Trades Union Congress's policy on nuclear armament fraught with irreconcilable contradictions. On the one hand, it expresses "loyalty" to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and supports the U.S. "nuclear weapons strategy," while at the same time, it condemns the U.S. policy of setting up missile bases throughout Western Europe, and demands the establishment of a military and nuclear weapons buffer zone through consultations among the great powers.
    A series of resolutions on establishing links and expanding contacts between trade unions in socialist and capitalist countries were also rejected under the obstruction of right-wing leaders.
    The annual meeting also passed some resolutions on demanding improvements in the living conditions of people receiving old-age pensions or relief.

### 英职工大会年会克服右翼领导阻挠  通过决议反对美国在英建立导弹基地

    英职工大会年会克服右翼领导阻挠
    通过决议反对美国在英建立导弹基地
    本报伦敦12日电　本报记者苏蓝报道：从7日开始在布莱克浦举行的英国职工大会第九十一届年会已于11日闭幕。年会以四百零四万票对三百八十六万五千票通过了“反对英国政府允许美国在英国设立导弹基地”的决议。它反映了英国广大人民反对美国战争政策的强烈情绪，以及要求和缓国际紧张局势的迫切愿望。
    在这次年会的议程上，除了工资、工作条件等问题以外，有关核子武器的问题，成为压倒一切的中心。
    早在这次年会之前，有关核子武器的问题，就在英国工党和工会组织内部展开了尖锐的争论。一方面是，工党和职工大会的右翼领袖们，曾联合提出了所谓“无核俱乐部”计划。这个计划主张在苏美两国以外所有国家都同意不拥有核武器的条件下英国“停止制造和占有核武器”。实际上是在英国有条件地“停止制造和占有核武器”的伪装下，赞成英国政府的现行政策。这也就是支持北大西洋公约集团，支持美国的核子威慑政策。而另一方面，是拥有一百三十万会员的运输和普通工人工会为代表的英国普通工人，他们要求英国单独停止试验和制造核子武器，并撤消美国在英国的导弹基地。这两种截然不同的意见，标志着英国普通工人和工党、工会右翼领袖之间的尖锐对立。
    除了通过反对美国基地的决议以外，在这次年会上，还以五百四十一万票的绝对多数，通过了全国造车工人联合会所提出的反对用核武器武装西德的决议。这项决议说：“职工大会反对西德进行核武装，要求各大国在不使用武力或武力威胁情况下举行解决柏林问题的谈判，并主张有东西德双方的代表参加会谈。”但是，由运输和普通工人工会提出的要求英国停止试验和制造核武器的提案，则在右翼工会领袖的操纵下，受到了否决。
    这就使职工大会在核武装问题上的政策，充满了难以调和的矛盾。它一方面表示“忠诚”于北大西洋集团，拥护美国的“核武器战略”，同时又斥责了美国在西欧遍设导弹基地的政策，要求通过大国协商建立军事和核武器的隔离。
    关于社会主义国家和资本主义国家的工会之间建立连系和扩大接触的一系列决议也在右翼领导的阻挠下，遭到了否决。
    年会还通过了关于要求改善领养老金或救济金的人的生活状况的一些决议。
