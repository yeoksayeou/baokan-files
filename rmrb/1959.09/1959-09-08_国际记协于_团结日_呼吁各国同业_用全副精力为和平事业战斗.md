Xinhua News Agency, September 7th. The International Organization of Journalists issued a letter to journalists of all countries for the "International Journalists' Solidarity Day" held on September 8th. The full text is as follows:

"To the Journalists of All Countries,

Dear friends, in many countries, September 8th is celebrated as International Journalists' Solidarity Day. Sixteen years ago (September 8, 1943), Czechoslovak journalist Julius Fučík was heinously executed in a Nazi torture chamber. Fučík is known worldwide for his shocking 'Report from the Gallows,' and his life and death serve as an example of faithfully fulfilling the noble mission of journalism. Throughout the world, thousands of our journalist comrades have sacrificed their lives in the fight against fascism and for the peace, freedom, and equality of all nations.

Unfortunately, persecutions of journalists have not ceased in some countries, and in some places, they have even intensified recently. These journalists defend the goals for which their colleagues once heroically sacrificed themselves. The Athens military court, brutally trampling on the human rights and freedom of the press stipulated in the United Nations Charter, sentenced Manolis Glezos, a Greek national hero and president of 'Avghi' (Dawn) newspaper, to a long prison term. Glezos, a recipient of the International Journalism Prize, is known for his struggle against fascist aggressors, and he is completely innocent of all the charges leveled against him. Henri Alleg, editor-in-chief of 'Alger Républicain,' was imprisoned after being subjected to inhuman torture. In prison, he wrote a book strongly condemning colonialism, 'The Question.' Countless other journalists are held in concentration camps or prisons in Algeria, Tunisia, Cameroon (where all newspapers have ceased publication), South Korea, South Vietnam, Turkey, and many other countries. On this International Journalists' Solidarity Day, we appeal to you, to those who cherish the human rights and freedom of the press proclaimed by the United Nations, to all those who use their pens to serve the cause of justice, progress, and peace: please strongly protest the persecution of journalists and demand the immediate release of all imprisoned colleagues. It is within our power to draw the attention of world public opinion to unprecedented injustices and atrocities and to unite public support for those who have been unjustly persecuted. We will all certainly do our best to donate to the International Journalists' Solidarity Fund and participate in its fundraising efforts to help the families of those who have lost their freedom defending everyone's freedom. Only the solidarity of journalists, the establishment of comradely relations, and mutual assistance can effectively protect our own material and spiritual interests. If we ourselves do not have goodwill and mutual understanding, we cannot promote mutual understanding between countries, which is the primary task of all journalists! Thanks to the international solidarity of journalists supported by world public opinion, the murderous hands threatening Manolis Glezos were stopped; German journalists alone have already collected six million signatures on a petition demanding his immediate release.

Thanks to comradely support, a fund has been raised, although the amount is still small. For the International Solidarity Fund, all journalists will donate their full day's wage or part of their wage on September 8th and conduct general fundraising to alleviate the difficult situation of persecuted colleagues and their families, and to assist journalists who are in particular need of material assistance due to disasters, the closure and suspension of newspapers, the closure of news agencies, etc. Thanks to the solidarity and mutual assistance of journalists, it has also been possible to build and open the world's first and currently only International Journalists' House in an unprecedentedly short time of less than a year.

Journalists from all countries who strengthen peace and promote international cooperation with their pens can relax, create, and meet with their colleagues in the lovely town of Varna on the picturesque Black Sea coast of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. This is the successful implementation of one of the resolutions made at the First International Journalists' Conference held in Helsinki in 1956, which was attended by 250 journalists representing 44 countries.

We hereby inform all our colleagues and ask them to promote this kind of fruitful international cooperation, friendship, and solidarity.

Recently, there has been some apparent improvement in international relations. Countries that long for lasting peace place great hope in the upcoming mutual visits between the heads of the world's two major powers—Khrushchev and Eisenhower. We journalists can make many contributions to the faster melting of the Cold War ice and allowing all countries to breathe freely.

Dear friends, let us realize this noble cause! Let us use all our abilities, experience, and the burning passion in our hearts to seek further easing and the final ending of international tensions, striving for consolidated peace and developing comprehensive cooperation between countries!

Hasn't the time come when journalists from all our countries should, without exception, sit at a round table in a friendly spirit to discuss the inspiring and responsible work that has been accumulated over the past years, which is a very important issue?

These are all the hopes and opinions we would like to offer you on International Journalists' Solidarity Day.

With friendly greetings,

The International Organization of Journalists"

### 国际记协于“团结日”呼吁各国同业  用全副精力为和平事业战斗

    国际记协于“团结日”呼吁各国同业
    用全副精力为和平事业战斗
    新华社7日讯　国际新闻工作者协会为在9月8日举行“国际新闻工作者团结日”发表了致各国新闻工作者的信，全文如下：
    “致各国的新闻工作者
    亲爱的朋友们，在9月8日，许多国家举行国际新闻工作者团结日。在十六年前（1943年）的9月8日，捷克斯洛伐克新闻工作者尤利乌斯·伏契克在纳粹的刑讯室里被罪恶地处决了。伏契克因他的震慑人心的‘绞刑下的报告’而闻名全世界，他的生与死是忠实履行崇高的新闻工作使命的榜样。而在世界各国又有我们的数以千计的新闻工作者同志为反对法西斯主义，为争取各国的和平、自由和平等而献出了他们的生命。
    不幸的是，有些国家非但没有停止对新闻工作者的迫害，并且最近在有些地方甚至更变本加厉。这些新闻工作者捍卫着他们的同行曾经为之英勇牺牲的目标。雅典军事法庭粗暴地践踏联合国宪章规定的人权和出版自由，把希腊民族英雄、‘黎明日报’社长曼诺里斯·格列索斯处以长期徒刑。格列索斯是国际新闻工作者奖金获得者，他因同法西斯侵略者的斗争而闻名，他完全没有犯人们所加予他的那一切罪状。‘共和阿尔及尔报’总编辑亨利·阿勒格在受到毫无人性的折磨以后被关在狱中，他在狱中写了一本强烈谴责殖民主义‘自由’的书：‘质问’。还有许许多多新闻工作者被关在阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、喀麦隆（那里所有的报纸停止出版）、南朝鲜、南越、土耳其和其他许多国家的集中营或监狱里。值此国际新闻工作者团结日，我们向你们，向珍视联合国所宣布的人权和出版自由的人，向所有那些用他们的笔为正义、进步与和平事业服务的人呼吁，请你们强烈抗议对新闻工作者的迫害和要求立即释放所有被关在监狱里的同事。促使全世界舆论注意前所未闻的不义的暴行和团结公众支持那些无辜遭到迫害的人，这是我们力所能及的。我们大家都一定会尽力向国际新闻工作者团结基金捐献并且参加这个基金的募捐工作，以便救济那些为了保卫大家的自由而失去自己的自由的人的家属。只有新闻工作者的团结、建立同志般的关系以及相互援助，才能有效地保卫我们自己的物质和精神利益。如果我们自己没有善意和相互谅解的话，我们就不能够促进各国之间的相互谅解，而这是全体新闻工作者的首要任务！由于得到全世界舆论支持的新闻工作者的国际团结，威胁曼诺里斯·格列索斯的刽子手的魔掌被制止了，现在仅仅是德国新闻工作者就已经在要求立即释放他的请愿书上收集了六百万个签名。
    由于同志般的支援，已经募集了基金，虽然这个数目还很小。对于国际团结基金，所有新闻工作者将在9月8日献出他们的全天工资或部分工资，并进行普遍募捐，来减轻被迫害的同事和他们的家属所处的困难处境，援助由于灾难、报社的封闭和停刊、新闻社的封闭等等而特别需要物质援助的新闻工作者。由于新闻工作者的团结和互助，还使得有可能在不到一年的空前短的时间内修建开办了世界上第一所在目前是唯一的一所国际新闻工作者大厦。
    来自各国的、用他们的笔加强和平与促进国际合作的新闻工作者们，可以在保加利亚人民共和国黑海海滨景色如画的瓦尔纳这个可爱的地方，很好地休息、进行创作和与他们的同行聚首一堂。这是成功地履行1956年在赫尔辛基举行的第一届国际新闻工作者会议作出的决议之一。出席那次会议的有代表四十四个国家的二百五十名新闻工作者。
    我们谨此通知我们所有的同行，同时要求他们促进产生这种良好成果的国际合作、友谊和团结。
    最近国际关系显然已有某种改善。渴望持久和平的各个国家，都对世界上两个主要国家的首脑——赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔——即将进行的互相访问，寄予了很大的希望。我们新闻工作者能够对更快地融化冷战的冰块和使得各个国家自由呼吸，作出许多贡献。
    亲爱的朋友们，让我们实现这个崇高的事业吧！让我们以我们所有的能力、经验和我们心中燃烧着的热情，来求得进一步缓和与最后结束国际紧张局势，争取巩固的和平和在各国之间发展全面的合作！
    我们各国的新闻工作者应该一无例外地坐在一张圆桌上以友好的精神来讨论过去多年积累起来的、对我们的鼓舞人心的和责任重大的工作，是十分重要的问题，这样一个时候难道还没有到来吗？
    这些是我们在国际新闻工作者团结日愿意向你们提出的一切希望和意见。
                          谨　致友谊的敬礼
                  国际新闻工作者协会”
