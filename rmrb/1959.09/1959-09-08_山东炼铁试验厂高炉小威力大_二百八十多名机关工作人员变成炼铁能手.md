Shandong Iron Smelting Experimental Factory's Small Blast Furnaces Achieve Great Power
More Than 280 Office Staff Transformed into Iron Smelting Experts

(Our newspaper, Jinan, 7th dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Shandong Provincial Committee and Provincial People's Committee Iron Smelting Experimental Factory resolutely implemented the Party's General Line, deeply unfolded the campaign to increase production and practice economy, enabling the factory's four small blast furnaces, like many small blast furnaces throughout the province, to persistently maintain high quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety.

Currently, this factory has two 3-cubic-meter and two 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces. The entire factory has more than 670 people, of which more than 280 were originally office cadres and service personnel, and the rest were workers transferred from various factories (mostly non-steel factories), as well as temporary contract workers from the countryside. The four blast furnaces were put into production in August, September, October of last year and March of this year, respectively. Over the past year, the factory has produced a cumulative total of more than 9,400 tons of pig iron. The four blast furnaces that were put into production have been operating normally. The management level and operational level of the enterprise have also gradually improved, and it has been rated as one of the advanced factories in the province. The factory's "Crossing the River" No. 13-cubic-meter blast furnace has achieved an average utilization coefficient of 1.256 for more than seven months, with an average pig iron qualification rate of 95.06%, and has won the title of National Red Flag Furnace.

Vigorously launching mass movements is one of the important measures for this factory to organize normal production. In terms of grasping plans and setting targets, the factory leadership has always paid attention to mobilizing the masses. When assigning tasks, in addition to providing the masses with the "bottom line" (explaining favorable conditions, unfavorable factors, methods, and measures), they also used the method of "one pole to the end" to mobilize the masses to discuss plans, formulate plans, and execute plans, and launch socialist labor competitions. They also consciously guided the masses to combine soaring enthusiasm with technological innovation.

Over the past year, this factory has not only created wealth for the country and contributed to the overall victory of the steel front, but also fully demonstrated the vitality of small blast furnaces, confirming that as long as people exert their full effort and do everything possible, small blast furnaces can also achieve long-term achievements in high quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety.

    山东炼铁试验厂高炉小威力大
    二百八十多名机关工作人员变成炼铁能手
    本报济南7日电　中共山东省委、省人委机关炼铁试验厂，坚决贯彻执行党的总路线，深入开展增产节约运动，使全厂四座小高炉和全省各地许多小高炉一样，持久地保持优质、高产、低耗、安全。
    目前，这个厂有三立方米和十三立方米高炉各两座，全厂共有六百七十多人，其中二百八十多人原系机关干部和勤杂人员，其余是各工厂（绝大部分系非钢铁厂）调来的工人，以及从农村来的临时合同工。四座高炉分别于去年8、9、10月及今年3月投入生产。一年来，全厂已累计生产生铁九千四百多吨；先后投入生产的四座高炉，一直保持正常。企业的管理水平和操作水平也逐步有了提高，并且被评为全省的先进工厂之一。这个厂渡江号十三立方米高炉，七个多月来，平均利用系数达一点二五六，生铁平均合格率为95.06％，荣获全国红旗炉称号。
    大搞群众运动是这个厂组织正常生产的重要措施之一。在抓计划、定指标方面，厂领导上一贯注意放手发动群众，在交任务时，除了向群众交“底”（交有利条件、交不利因素、交办法、交措施）外，并且用一杆子插到底的办法，发动群众讨论计划、制定计划、执行计划，开展社会主义劳动竞赛。并且有意识地引导群众把冲天干劲同革新技术结合起来。
    一年来，这个厂不仅为国家创造了财富，为钢铁战线的全胜贡献了力量，而且充分显示了小高炉的生命力，证实了只要人们鼓足干劲，千方百计地努力去做，小高炉同样也可以长期获得优质、高产、低耗、安全等战绩。
