    A Strand of Silver Hair
    Fu Jialei
    If you walk into the "Healthy Beauty" Barber Shop, you will immediately find yourself walking towards yourself; if you stand in the middle of the barber shop, it will be even more wonderful, you will find yourself surrounded by yourself. This is because the walls around are inlaid with large mirrors, making people feel like they have entered a maze, as if the barber shop has countless suites.
    Everything here is brightly lit, and under the fluorescent tube lights, the hairdressing tools, glassware, tiles, porcelain basins, and slippery floors all reflect shadows.
    The clippers and scissors sound lightly, crisply, and rhythmically; the faucets gurgle, rinsing the soap suds from the customers' heads.
    Among the barbers, there is a girl, at most seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a mask with sparkling eyes. She wears a white coat, white socks, and soft-soled white shoes, walking lightly, without making a sound. Her fingers are also soft and slender, and look very skillful... but strangely, customers are reluctant to sit in her barber chair.
    "The next one for a cut... please!" Her voice is sweet and gentle. She tries hard to appear experienced and generous, but involuntarily reveals the shyness of a young girl.
    No one answers, and no one stands up.
    "The next one for a cut... please!" she says again.
    Still no one answers, and no one stands up. At this time, two customers sitting in the chairs are whispering:
    One says: "She's a novice, you can tell from the way she shakes out the cloth..."
    The other says: "I don't let just anyone practice on my head."
    All this is seen by a customer who is nearly fifty years old. Judging from his face and wrinkles, he is a veteran who has experienced many hardships, but his eyes are exceptionally bright and piercing: wise, kind, benevolent, and passionate.
    "The next one..." the girl says again, embarrassed.
    "Girl, please give me a haircut!"
    This elder is wearing blue pants and a white shirt, and he has already automatically unbuttoned his collar before sitting down.
    When the girl is putting the cloth around him, he whispers: "Not too loose, and not too tight; if it's too loose, hair will get in, and if it's too tight, it will strangle your neck, right?" The girl nods.
    When the girl picks up the clippers, he whispers again: "Hold the clippers flat, use even force with each stroke, and relax your fingers when moving the clippers so you don't catch the hair... right?"
    The girl smiles and says "Um."
    When the clippers are buzzing, he says to the girl:
    "You're doing a good job! It's quite comfortable.... Don't be nervous... when soldiers are drilling, if they panic, they will definitely take the wrong step; when shooting targets, if you can't calm down, you will definitely miss... No matter what you do, you have to be calm... Right, right! This is pretty good!"
    When the girl picks up the scissors, he says:
     "Feel free to cut... these few hairs of mine... it doesn't matter. If the back is cut badly, we'll change it to a side part; if the side part is cut badly, we'll change it to a small side part; if the small side part is cut badly, we'll change it to a crew cut; if the crew cut is cut badly, we'll change it to a buzz cut; if the buzz cut is also cut badly... just... shave it all off, wouldn't it be cooler?"
    The girl can't help but burst out laughing.
    The girl's heart is no longer flustered, she feels confident and skillful, and her movements are very light and quick, even she is a little confused: how is it that my skills have improved so quickly! She feels happy in her heart.
    She thinks to herself: "This old man is really good at giving advice, could it be..." She blurts out: "Could it be that you used to be a barber?"
    "That's a long story, things from decades ago..."
     "No wonder, you're a master!"
    "Back when I was a barber, the barber shop was much bigger than this; the lights were much brighter than here; and the water was much better than here..."
    "What was it like?"
    "Heaven and earth were the barber shop, the sun and moon were the lights, washing hair in the big rivers and lakes, running water is the cleanest!"
    "Oh! I understand, you carried a pole and traveled to the villages..."
    "No, like a medic, carrying a small bag. To be honest, when I first learned to cut hair, my skills were much worse than yours now... to put it bluntly, it looked like a melon rind..."
    "Oh! Then people weren't angry?"
    "Angry? Of course not! Never mind the poor skills, as long as you can shave off the hair!"
    "Master, you're really good at making people laugh..."
    While the elder is getting his haircut, a young sailor comes in and sits there, motionless, as if waiting for a haircut, but his hair is not long.
    After the elder finishes his haircut, he looks in the mirror, smooths his hair back with both hands, and touches his cleanly shaved chin, laughing heartily and contentedly: "Thank you, girl!... Look, I suddenly feel decades younger..." Then he says to the sailor's shadow in the mirror: "Petty Officer Comrade, do you think I'm qualified to enlist on a ship?"
    The sailor petty officer walks up to the elder with great spirit and snaps to attention:
    "Reporting, Commander Comrade! Because you are enlisting on a ship tomorrow, the Political Commissar has invited you to his home for a simple meal."
    "Is it sauerkraut noodles with stir-fried green peppers?"
    The sailor answers with a smile: "Yes."
    The general seems to remember something and turns to the girl and says:
    "That's right, the first person who let me cut his hair was the Political Commissar who is inviting me to dinner today... I remember it clearly, on the banks of the Dadu River... at that time, both of us were sweating a lot, like it was raining, and the Dadu River even rose because of it..."
    The girl is so excited, she doesn't know what to do, her eyes are watery. She pulls off her mask, her lips trembling slightly, as if she wants to say something, but can't say a word.
    She reluctantly sees the general out of the barber shop. The general extends his warm hand and shakes her child-like nimble little hand, saying: "Thank you! Do a good job! Goodbye!"
    She feels encouraged like a kind father, and feels a new force surging in her veins.
    She keeps watching the general's back. The general waves to her one last time and is obscured by the shadows of the trees on the boulevard...
    She returns to the barber shop, picks up the white cloth that the general had worn and shakes it. Out of habit, she is about to raise her hand to shake it again when she suddenly stops, slowly, gently, and carefully picks up a strand of silver hair from the cloth! With tears in her eyes, she gazes at it for a long time, and clips it into a red-covered gold-lettered diary...

    一丝银发
    符加雷
    你要是走进“健美”理发厅，立刻就会发现自己向自己迎面走过来；要是往理发厅中间一站，那就更妙了，你会发觉自己被自己包围起来了。这是因为四周的墙壁上，都镶着大镜子，使人好似走进了迷宫，仿佛理发厅有数不清的套间。
    这里的一切都是明晃晃的，在棒形日光灯下理发用具、玻璃器皿、瓷砖、瓷盆、滑溜溜的地板，都照得见人影儿。
    推子、剪子轻轻地、清脆地、有规律地响着；水龙头哗哗地冲洗着顾客头上的肥皂沫。
    在理发师当中，有一个姑娘，顶多十七、八岁，戴着口罩，眼睛亮晶晶的，她穿着白罩衣、白袜子、小软底白面鞋，走起路来，轻飘飘的，连一点声响都没有。她的手指头儿，也很柔嫩纤细，看起来一定很巧……可是奇怪得很，顾客们却不愿意坐到她的理发椅子上去。
    “那一位理……请！”她的声音甜而温柔。她很想使自己显得老练大方，可是却不由自主地流露出年轻姑娘的羞涩来。
    没有人应声，也没有人站起来。
    “那一位理……请！”她又说了一次。
    还是没有人应声，也没有人站起来。这时候，有两个顾客坐在椅子上轻声地发议论：
    一个说：“是个新手，看那个抖围巾的架式就知道了……。”
    另一个说：“我这个脑袋，是不让谁学手艺的。”
    这一切，被一位将近五十岁的顾客看到了。这位顾客，从他的脸色和皱纹看来，是一位久经风霜的长者，可是他的眼睛，却异常灼烁有神：明智、敦厚、慈祥而又热情。
    “那一位……。”姑娘又窘迫地说了一遍。
    “姑娘，请给我理吧！”
    这位长者，穿着蓝裤子、白衬衫，他还未坐下，已经自动把领扣解开了。
    当姑娘给他勒围巾的时候，他小声说：“别太松，也别太紧；松了钻头发，紧了勒脖子，对吧？”姑娘点点头。
    当姑娘拿起推子的时候，他又小声说：“推子要拿平，一下一下用力均匀，移推子的时候手指头放松就不会夹头发了……对吧？”
    姑娘笑着“嗯”了一声。
    当推子喳喳响的时候，他对姑娘说：
    “你理得不错呀！挺舒服的……。别紧张……当兵下操，心慌了一定迈错步子；打靶沉不住气，一定吃烧饼……。不论干啥事，都得沉着。……对对！这不挺好嘛！”
    姑娘拿起剪刀的时候，他又说：
     “放心大胆剪好了……我这几根头发……没关系。后拢剪坏了，咱改大分头；大分头剪坏了，咱改小分头；小分头剪坏了，咱改大平头；大平头剪坏了，咱改小平头；小平头也剪坏了……干脆……来个推光，不是更凉快吗？”
    姑娘忍不住“噗哧”一声笑了。
    姑娘的心一点也不发慌了，感到得心应手，动作十分轻巧，连自己也有些儿莫名其妙：怎么，我的技术进步这么快！心里乐滋滋的。
    她心里想：“这位老大爷真会指点，莫非……”她一下子就说出口来了：“莫非你当过理发的？”
    “说起来话长，几十年前的事喽……。”
     “怪不是呢，您是老师傅啦！”
    “当初我理发，那理发所比这个大多了；灯，比这里的亮多了；水，也比这里的好多了……。”
    “到底什么样儿呵？”
    “天和地就是理发所，太阳、月亮便是灯，大江大河里洗头，长流水最干净！”
    “噢！我知道了，您是挑着担儿游四乡呵……。”
    “不，跟卫生员一样，背个小挂包儿。说实话，我刚学理发，技术比你现在差多了……说句不中听的，理得跟花西瓜皮差不多……。”
    “哟！那人家不生气呀？”
    “生气？那里话！别看手艺不强，能剃掉头发就行！”
    “老师傅，您真会逗人乐……”
    在这位长者理发的当儿，进来一位年轻的水兵，坐在那里，一动不动，好像在等着理发，可是头发并不长。
    这位长者理完发以后，对着镜子，双手把头发往后捺了捺，又摸摸胡子刮得光光的下巴，满意地爽朗地笑着说：“谢谢你，姑娘！……看，我一下子年轻几十年……。”接着他朝着在镜子里的那位水兵的影子说：“下士同志，你看我上舰当兵够不够格？”
    那位水兵下士，很有精神地走到长者面前，咔噔一下立个正：
    “报告，司令员同志！因为您明天要上舰当兵，政委请你到家里吃便饭。”
    “是酸菜杂面条，外加炒青辣椒吗？”
    水兵笑着回答：“是。”
    这位将军好像想起了什么，转向姑娘说：
    “对了，第一个让我理发的，就是今天请我吃饭的政委。……我记得清清楚楚，在大渡河边……当时我们两个，谁也没少出汗，跟下雨一样，大渡河都因此涨水了呢……”
    姑娘是多么激动呵，不知怎样才好了，眼睛水汪汪的。她扯下了口罩，嘴唇微微颤动着，似乎要说什么，却一句也说不出来。
    她依依不舍地送将军走出了理发厅。将军伸出温暖的大手，握了握她那孩子般的灵巧的小手，说：“谢谢！好好干吧！再见！”
    她受到了慈父般的鼓励，觉得有一种新的力量在血管里奔腾。
    她一直望着将军的背影。将军最后向她招招手，被林荫道的树影遮住了……。
    她回到理发厅，拿起了将军围过的白围巾抖了抖，由于习惯，正要举起手再抖一次的时候，忽然停了下来，慢慢地、轻轻地、小心翼翼地从围巾上捏起一丝银发来！她噙着泪花儿凝视了好一会，把它夹在一个红皮金字的日记本里……。
