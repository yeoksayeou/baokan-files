    Grasp Production Increase with One Hand, Grasp Economy with the Other
    Chenjing Commune Transforms from Grain-Deficient to Grain-Surplus
    (Our report) The Chenjing People's Commune in Linxia City, Gansu Province, adhering to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, has changed its grain-deficient status, and other productions have also developed by leaps and bounds.
    The commune is located in an area of continuous high mountains and deep ravines. Of the commune's more than 62,000 mu of cultivated land, 95% is mountainous, and it is often threatened by drought. Before liberation, grain production was extremely low, and it relied on grain supplies from other places. After liberation, although grain production increased year by year, it still did not get rid of the situation of insufficient grain. In 1958, the Chenjing area Party organization led all cadres and the masses to march on nature and seize grain from drought with the determination that "man can conquer nature." At the same time, four townships and seventeen advanced agricultural cooperatives merged to form the Chenjing People's Commune. Through large-scale farmland capital construction and improved farmland cultivation techniques, a bumper harvest of grain was achieved in 1958. After threshing and final accounting, the total grain output was more than 14.5 million jin, an increase of 113.7% compared with 1957; the average grain per person was 1,053 jin, thus changing the grain-deficient situation. In 1958, more than 580,000 jin of public grain was delivered to the state, exceeding the quota by 19.7%, more than 1.875 million jin of surplus grain was sold, exceeding the quota by 88.9%, and more than 71,000 jin of oilseeds were sold, exceeding the quota by 148%.
    Encouraged by the bumper grain harvest, the commune Party committee led the masses to hold high the red flag and formulated a plan to strive for more than 1,300 jin of grain per person this year. After more than half a year of efforts, this plan has the conditions to be overfulfilled. The total output of more than 30,000 mu of wheat, which accounts for 56% of the grain sown area, exceeded 9.4 million jin; more than 16,000 mu of potatoes, which account for 20% of the total sown area, are also growing well. Animal husbandry, which is taking off with grain production, has also shown a prosperous scene. This year's newly produced lambs totaled more than 6,400, equivalent to more than 50% of the number of sheep in 1958. The total number of sheep in the commune has reached more than 19,300, an average of eight sheep per household. There are more than 4,500 head of large livestock, an increase of 10% over last year. Pigs, rabbits, chickens and other domestic animals and poultry have also achieved great results because the policy of giving equal importance to public and private raising has been implemented. The commune-run industry is thriving, with a total output value of 350,000 yuan from January to July. In terms of sideline production, each production team has established a professional team with fixed personnel, and the income in the first half of the year reached more than 100,100 yuan. With the development of production, the income of commune members has continued to increase, and their lives have continued to improve. The amount of savings has increased by 33% compared with 1958.
    The achievements of the Chenjing People's Commune are first and foremost the result of the commune Party committee's adherence to putting politics in command and implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. While grasping production increase, the commune Party committee also attached great importance to economy, combining "opening up new sources" and "reducing expenditure." For example, after the bumper harvest, the masses were immediately organized to discuss and make overall arrangements for grain consumption in accordance with the spirit of preparedness and long-term planning. From October last year to now, the commune Party committee has held 17 meetings to study the issue of saving grain, educating commune members through recollection, comparison, exhibitions, on-site meetings, and setting up red flags. More than 239,000 jin of grain has been saved in ten months.
    Due to the large organizational scale of the people's commune, it can uniformly plan the production of the entire commune, rationally use land, and give full play to its potential for increasing production. The commune Party committee, in conjunction with the soil survey, changed all the black soil and sandy soil耕地 from Yaojiazhuang to Xujiawan and from Xujiawan to Zhongshan from the original buckwheat and beans to wheat and potatoes. As a result, the wheat sown area increased by 50% compared with last year, creating favorable conditions for this year's grain increase.
    Because the commune runs a large number of collective welfare undertakings, commune members can concentrate their energy on production and give greater play to their enthusiasm. All members of the Chenjing People's Commune eat in the canteen, and there are more than 2,000 children in nurseries throughout the commune. As a result, 2,226 female laborers, accounting for 43% of the commune's total labor force, have been put into production activities.
    The communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the decision on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy have brought great encouragement to the masses of the Chenjing Commune who are fighting hard. The commune members revised the original plan of 358 jin per mu average grain yield in 1959 and proposed the goal of striving for an average yield of 500 jin per mu. At present, all members are actively carrying out a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy.

    一手抓增产  一手抓节约
    陈井公社由缺粮变余粮
    本报讯　甘肃临夏市陈井人民公社坚持勤俭办社的方针，改变了缺粮现象，其它各项生产也都飞跃发展。
    这个公社境内高山毗连，深沟交错，全社六万二千多亩耕地中，山地占95％，经常遭受干旱的威胁。解放前，粮食产量极低，一直靠外地供应口粮。解放后，粮食产量虽然逐年增加，但仍然没有摆脱口粮不足的局面。1958年，陈井地区党组织，领导全体干部和群众，以“人定胜天”的决心，向自然进军，向干旱夺粮。同时，四个乡、十七个高级农业社合并组成了陈井人民公社。通过大搞农田基本建设和改进农田耕作技术，使得1958年粮食生产获得大丰收。经过打收和最后核算，粮食总产量为一千四百五十多万斤，比1957年增加了113.7％；每人平均有粮一千零五十三斤，从此改变了缺粮局面。1958年给国家交纳公粮五十八万多斤，超额19.7％，出售余粮一百八十七万五千多斤，超额88.9％；出售油籽七万一千余斤，超额148％。
    在粮食大丰收的鼓舞下，公社党委领导群众高举红旗，制订了今年每人有粮一千三百斤以上的奋斗计划。经过半年多的努力，这个计划已经具备了超额完成的条件。占粮食播种面积56％的三万多亩小麦，总产超过九百四十多万斤；占播种总面积20％的一万六千多亩洋芋，也普遍生长良好。与粮食生产展翅高飞的畜牧业，也出现了槽头兴旺的景象。今年新产的羊羔共有六千四百多只，相当于1958年羊只数量的50％强，全社羊只总数已达到一万九千三百余只，平均每户有羊八只。大牲畜达到了四千五百余头，比去年增加了10％。猪、兔、鸡等家畜家禽，因为贯彻执行了公养私养并重的方针，也取得了很大的成绩。社办工业蒸蒸日上，1月至7月总产值达三十五万元。在副业生产方面，各生产队都成立了专业队，固定专人，上半年的收入达到十万零一千余元。随着生产的发展，社员的收入不断增加，生活不断改善，存款额比1958年上升了33％。
    陈井人民公社取得跃进的成就，首先是因为公社党委坚持政治挂帅，坚持执行了增产节约方针的结果。在抓增产的同时，公社党委还特别重视节约工作，把“开源”和“节流”结合起来。例如在大丰收之后，就立即组织群众讨论，根据有备无患、细水长流的精神，作好了粮食消费的统筹安排。从去年10月到现在，公社党委又专门召开了十七次会议研究节约粮食的问题，用回忆、对比、展览、现场会、树红旗等方式教育社员，十个月内节约粮食二十三万九千余斤。
    由于人民公社组织规模大，可以统一筹划全社的生产，合理使用土地，发挥了增产潜力。公社党委结合土壤普查，把姚家庄到徐家湾、徐家湾到中山一带的黑土和砂质土耕地，全部由原种荞麦和豆类改种成小麦和洋芋。这样，小麦播种面积比去年增加了50％，为今年粮食增产创造了有利的条件。
    由于公社大量举办集体福利事业，因而使社员能集中精力投入生产，发挥更大的积极性。陈井公社的社员全都在食堂吃饭，全社受托儿童两千多名。这样一来，占公社总劳力43％的二千二百二十六个妇女劳力，便投入了生产活动。
    中共八届八中全会的公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议，给正在奋战中的陈井公社广大群众带来了极大的鼓舞力量。社员们修订了原来1959年粮食平均亩产三百五十八斤的计划，提出平均亩产五百斤的奋斗指标。目前，全体社员正积极开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。
