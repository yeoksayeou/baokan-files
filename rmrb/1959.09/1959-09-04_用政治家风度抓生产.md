Grasp Production with the Demeanor of a Statesman
　　Gong Lie

Opening the newspapers these days is truly a feast for the eyes, and inspires the heart. The Party's call has already generated tremendous material force. The entire industrial world is seething with activity.

This change once again tells us a truth: politics is the commander, the soul, and grasping politics is the fundamental solution. Without addressing the root cause, only treating the symptoms, dealing with matters as they stand, and not grasping the essential meaning, it is impossible to achieve a leap in production.

Grasping politics is specifically manifested in using the spirit of the General Line as a weapon to measure all work and guide all work. Industrial production appears to be intricate and complex, and many specific problems must be solved specifically. Such as equipment, materials, transportation, technology, and so on. It is impossible to achieve a leap forward by merely paying lip service to it without earnestly grasping these specific tasks. But there is a premise here: when you start to solve these specific problems, you should have a fundamental common weapon, a fundamental attitude. Your identity may be a technician, a factory director, or a sales person; but no matter who you are, you are first and foremost a socialist builder, an executor of the General Line. You should not only engage in production as a technical expert or a business management expert, but also engage in production with the demeanor of a statesman and the demeanor of a socialist fighter. When you deal with production issues, you should not only use slide rules, drawings, and machine tools; but more importantly, you should use a most fundamental common weapon, which is the General Line. Only in this way can all technical problems and production management problems be solved well. Only in this way, is it possible to achieve greater results than ever before under the same conditions. And only in this way, is it possible to obtain more outstanding results in units with poorer conditions than in units with better conditions. The recent rapid advancements in production in many factories have repeatedly proven this principle.

Here are two more common examples: In the past, the quality of steel in the steelmaking workshop of the Guizhou Automobile Manufacturing Plant did not improve quickly. The leadership had a "waiting for good iron" mentality. Some people believed that 90% of grey cast iron was needed to ensure the quality of the steel. But recently they broke this view, mobilized the masses, improved the batching, and used 10% grey cast iron and 90% white cast iron to produce steel that was better than in July. There is also a factory: originally they complained that the plan was too high and that there were not enough materials to complete it. But these few days, once right-leaning ideas were broken and morale was boosted, and the masses were mobilized, the result was: without adding a single pound of steel, the output value could be increased by 300,000 yuan. These kinds of things are both joyful and thought-provoking to hear. These news items are both good news and vivid teaching materials.

How should these phenomena be explained? The reason is very simple, it is a matter of putting politics in command, a matter of what attitude to use to grasp production. Every task in socialist construction is an arduous and complex undertaking, and outstanding achievements cannot be made without extraordinary effort. Relying on tapping potential to increase output by 300,000 yuan is certainly not an easy task; producing good steel with 90% white cast iron is not a relaxing thing either. Even if you have made some effort and boosted some enthusiasm, it is still difficult to achieve. It's like the fruit on a tree, the fruit can be picked, and the objective possibility is really there; but you need to muster your strength and jump, and sometimes even sweat, to get the fruit in your hand. When your mind is illuminated by the Party's General Line, when the Party's great leap forward horn excites your heartstrings, and when all conservative right-leaning ideas are swept away, then you will be like having wings, and the fruit will be in your hand. Under such circumstances, things that were impossible in the past can be done. New achievements have emerged. Under this ideological premise, you go to study material problems, equipment problems, and all kinds of specific problems, the attitude is different; your methods are also more numerous; and the caliber and size are also easily matched with the leadership and the masses. Otherwise, the effect will definitely be bad. This is a truth that this anti-rightist and morale-boosting movement has once again taught us.

Now, the movement is developing rapidly and the situation is very good. We should draw on the experience of the leaders of many advanced factories and mines in this production upsurge, adopt the demeanor of statesmen, and push the production upsurge higher and higher, and deeper and deeper.

### 用政治家风度抓生产

    用政治家风度抓生产
    龚烈
    打开近日报纸，真是琳琅满目，鼓舞人心。党的号召已经产生了巨大的物质力量。整个工业界沸腾起来了。
  这个变化，再一次告诉我们一条真理：政治是统帅、是灵魂，抓政治才是治本之计。不治本，光治标，就事论事，言不及义，是无法实现生产跃进的。
    抓政治，具体表现就是以总路线精神为武器来衡量一切工作，指导一切工作。工业生产看起来是错综复杂的，许多具体问题要具体解决。如像设备、材料、运输、技术，等等。不切实地抓好这些具体工作空谈跃进，是不可能实现跃进的。但是这里有个前提，当你动手去解决这些具体问题时，应有个根本的共同的武器，有个根本的态度。你的身分可能是技术员，可能是厂长，或是供销人员；但不管是谁，你首先是社会主义建设者，是总路线的执行者。你不仅要以技术专家或企业管理专家的身分来搞生产，而且要以政治家的风度、社会主义战士的风度来搞生产。你处理生产问题时，不仅要用计算尺、图纸和机具设备；而更重要的是要用一个最根本的共同的武器，这就是总路线。只有这样，一切技术问题、生产管理问题才好解决。只有这样，才可能做出在同样条件下所未曾达到过的更大的成绩。也只有这样，才可能在条件较差的情况下得到比条件较好的单位更为出色的效果。最近许多工厂生产上突飞猛进，反复地证明了这条道理。
    这里还可以举两个普通的例子：贵州汽车制造厂炼钢车间过去钢的质量提高不快，领导上存在着一种“等待吃好铁”的思想。有的人认为要用90％的灰口铁才能保证钢的质量。可是最近他们把这个看法打破了，发动群众，改进了配料，用10％的灰口铁和90％的白口铁，炼出了比7月份更好的钢来。还有一个厂：本来嫌计划太高，说材料不够，难以完成。可是这几天右倾一破，干劲鼓足，群众一动起来，结果是：不伸手增添一斤钢材，也可以增产三十万元的产值。这类事例听起来既叫人高兴，又引人深思。这些消息，既是喜报，又是生动的教材。
    上述这些现象应当怎样解释呢？道理很简单，是个政治挂帅的问题，是个用什么态度来抓生产的问题。社会主义建设中的每一任务都是艰巨复杂的事业，不经过非凡的努力是不能作出出色成绩的。依靠挖潜力，增产三十万元，这当然不是轻而易举的事；用90％的白口铁生产好钢，也不是轻松的玩意。即令你尽了一定的努力，鼓了一定的干劲，也是很难达到的。这就像树上的果子一样，果子是可以摘下来的，客观可能性是实实在在存在着的；但需要你鼓足劲跳一跳，有时候还要出一身汗，才能把果子摘到手。当你的头脑为党的总路线所照亮，当党的大跃进的号角激动了你的心弦，当一切保守右倾思想一扫而光，这时候，你就会像长了翅膀一样，果子就摘到手了。在这样的情况下，过去办不到的事就办到了。新的成绩出现了。在这样思想前提下，你去研究材料问题，设备问题，以及各种各样具体问题，态度就不一样了；你的办法也多了；口径和尺码也很容易和领导和群众吻合起来了。反之，效果一定不好。这就是这次反右倾、鼓干劲中再一次教育我们的一个真理。
    现在，运动正迅猛向前发展，形势非常好。我们应当汲取许多先进厂矿领导这次生产高潮的经验，拿出政治家的风度，把生产高潮越掀越高，越走越深入。
