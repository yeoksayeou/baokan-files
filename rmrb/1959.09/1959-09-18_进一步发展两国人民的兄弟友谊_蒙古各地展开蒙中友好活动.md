Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 16th. "Sino-Mongolian Friendship Activities," a fifteen-day event held throughout the Mongolian People's Republic to celebrate the 10th anniversary of China's National Day, began on the 16th in various locations across the country.

On the evening of the 16th, Ulaanbaatar City solemnly held the opening ceremony of the "Sino-Mongolian Friendship Activities." The venue was decorated with huge banners written in both Mongolian and Chinese languages, proclaiming "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Mongolian and Chinese Peoples." Seated on the rostrum were Mongolian Party and state leaders Sambu, Tumur-Ochir, Dugersuren, Molomjamts, Ramsuren, and Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, Xie Fangsheng.

Also attending the opening ceremony were heads of various people's organizations and foreign diplomatic envoys.

Vice Chairman of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association, Natsukdorj, said at the opening ceremony that the "Sino-Mongolian Friendship Activities" would be carried out under the slogan of further consolidating and developing the brotherly and unbreakable friendship between the two peoples. The past ten years have been a period of brilliant victories for the Chinese people on all fronts of socialist construction. Today, the industrious and courageous Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the glorious Communist Party headed by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, are working and leaping forward with full confidence to transform their motherland into a strong socialist country.

He said that the recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized and discussed the achievements made in the year of the Great Leap Forward and made important resolutions on further accelerating construction, developing and consolidating people's communes, launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and striving to overfulfill the various planned targets for 1959. The leap forward and development of the Chinese people have created favorable conditions for catching up with and surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years. The historical achievements made by the Chinese people have further strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, further consolidated world peace, and inspired the people of all countries, including the Mongolian people, who are engaged in socialist construction.

Natsukdorj also condemned the US imperialist occupation of China's territory of Taiwan.

He further stated that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, loyal to proletarian internationalism, have provided fraternal and sincere assistance to the Mongolian people over the past ten years, which is of great significance to Mongolia's socialist construction. During these days of friendship activities, the Mongolian people wish the Chinese people greater leaps forward in socialist construction.

Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, Xie Fangsheng, then spoke at the meeting. He expressed his gratitude for Mongolia's holding of "Sino-Mongolian Friendship Activities" throughout the country. He said that China and Mongolia are as close as brothers, and the "Sino-Mongolian Friendship Activities" once again demonstrated the Mongolian people's sincere friendship towards the Chinese people. Our people attach great importance to this friendship and will continue to work to consolidate and develop the friendship between the two countries.

    16日晚上，乌兰巴托市隆重举行了“蒙中友好活动”的开幕式。会场上挂着用蒙中两国文字写的“蒙中人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”的巨幅标语。坐在主席台上的有蒙古党和国家的领导人桑布、图穆尔—奥奇尔、杜格苏伦、莫洛姆扎木茨、拉姆苏伦，中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生。

    蒙中友好协会副主席那楚克道尔吉在开幕式上讲话说，“蒙中友好活动”将在进一步巩固和发展两国人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊的口号下进行。过去十年是中国人民在社会主义建设事业的各个战线上取得辉煌胜利的年代。今天，勤劳勇敢的中国人民在以伟大领袖毛泽东主席为首的光荣的共产党的英明领导下，为了使祖国变成强大的社会主义国家而满怀信心地劳动和跃进着。
    他说，最近召开的中国共产党八届八中全会总结和讨论了在跃进的一年内取得的成就，并作出了关于进一步加快建设、发展和巩固人民公社、掀起增产节约运动、争取超额完成1959年各项计划指标的重要决议。中国人民的跃进和发展为在十年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国创造了各项有利条件，中国人民取得的这些历史性成就进一步增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，更加巩固了世界和平，鼓舞着包括蒙古人民在内的从事社会主义建设的各国人民。
    那楚克道尔吉还谴责美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾的行为。
    他又说，忠于无产阶级国际主义的中国共产党和中国政府，十年来对蒙古人民所给予的兄弟般的真诚援助，对蒙古社会主义建设事业具有重大意义。在这友好活动的日子里，蒙古人民祝中国人民在社会主义建设中实现更大的跃进。
    中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生接着在会上讲话。他对蒙古在全国举行“蒙中友好活动”表示感谢。他说，中蒙两国亲如手足，“蒙中友好活动”又一次表示了蒙古人民对中国人民的诚挚友谊，我国人民非常重视这种友谊并将不断地为继续巩固和发展两国的友谊而努力。
