　　High Mountain Giant Dam Locks the Dragon
　　Yao Wenjin

　　Mount Heng, known as one of the Five Great Mountains, is called the First Mountain of the Border Region for its majestic form. The famous Eighteen Views of Mount Heng - Golden Rooster, Wangnian, Qinqi Terrace, White Cloud Cave, Stone Fat Diagram, Flying Stone Cave, Xuanwu Well, Sunset Ridge, etc. ... have attracted countless tourists. But today, even more striking is the Hengshan Reservoir, known as the Nineteenth View.

　　Going south from Hunyuan City for seven miles, you enter Tangyu. Tangyu is a source of the largest tributary of the Sanggan River - the Hun River. To its east, connecting the main peak of Mount Heng, Yuhua Mountain, which is over 2,000 meters above sea level, the towering cliffs are like a giant axe split open, with the air of "the yellow crane cannot fly past, even monkeys would struggle to climb." The ancients compared it to the "Sword Gate Heavenly Barrier" of the northern border region.

　　About two miles into the valley, you reach the Hanging Temple where "three horse tails hang on the hillside," this temple is one of the Eighteen Views of Mount Heng. The so-called "three horse tails" is just an exaggeration. The real Hanging Temple is built on a thirty-meter-high cliff, relying on a protruding rock. Dozens of thick wooden pillars support the front, and from a distance, the multi-storied pavilions connected by precarious ladders, not touching the sky above or the ground below, truly seem to be suspended in mid-air, the artistic conception of "cloud-deep sea towers" vividly before your eyes.

　　Going south from the Hanging Temple for dozens of steps, turning a bend, you see the Nineteenth View of Mount Heng - the reservoir. The beautiful Sunset Ridge and the miraculous White Cloud Cave are not worth mentioning compared to it, and even the Hanging Temple, which is "worthy of admiration," pales in comparison to the reservoir dam. The city wall of three zhang and six chi is considered high, but this arch dam is five or six times higher than the city wall. The Hanging Temple suspended in mid-air simply cannot match it. Height is not all, the fact that it is high and thin is even more astonishing. Yuan Bu-li, director of the reservoir project headquarters, said that if an earth dam were built here, it would need to be over 300 meters thick, while the concrete arch dam we see today is only two and a half meters wide at the top and only fifteen meters wide at the bottom, saving 50% to 80% of manpower compared to building an earth dam. Standing on the top of the mountain and looking down, the dam looks like a piece of glass inserted in the middle of Tangyu. It is said that this thin high arch dam is the first of its kind in our country. Seven engineers and technicians, based on the principle of safety and economy (every meter reduction in the thickness of the dam body saves more than 80,000 yuan), devoted themselves to calculating the "stress" of the dam body (the force of the arch body bearing external pressure). They hugged four computers and shook them day and night for more than two months. In addition to calculating the "stress" of the dam body against water pressure, they also calculated various "stresses" such as ice pressure, wave pressure, wind pressure, earthquake force, tension, and temperature changes. In short, they calculated all possible natural phenomena that could affect the safety of the dam body. Despite this, the state has also buried many instruments inside the dam to observe temperature, settlement, displacement, water temperature, etc. These instruments are like a stethoscope. If the dam body has any minor problems, it can be seen at a glance, and preventive measures can be taken immediately. Therefore, people say that it is not the dam that blocks the water here, but science.

　　The complete completion of this reservoir will give a new look to Mount Heng. At that time, it will be able to store more than 17 million cubic meters of water. An artificial lake with an area of several thousand mu will shine like a mirror, surrounded by the peaks of Mount Heng. At that time, Mount Heng, the "First Mountain of the Border Region" known as "having mountains but no water," will truly be a place of beautiful lakes and mountains, with pleasant scenery. However, the Hengshan Reservoir is not just to decorate the rivers and mountains. More importantly, it can irrigate more than 8,100 mu of land in the Hunyuan Plain. It can generate 330 kilowatt-hours of electricity every year, and can also be used to develop various economies such as fish farming and chicken farming. Moreover, it has direct significance for reducing the sediment content of the Yongding River and the Sanggan River (the Hun River alone exports 3.4 million cubic meters of sediment every year, which is one of the main sources of sediment for the Yongding River), maintaining the lifespan of fraternal reservoirs such as Guanting and the Ming Tombs, and protecting the beloved capital Beijing. However, for the 200,000 people of Hunyuan at the foot of Mount Heng, what they will never forget is the complete elimination of the flood disasters of Mount Heng.

　　Mount Heng is a beautiful tourist destination and a summer resort, but the laboring people who suffered from hunger and cold in the old society did not have such "blessings." On the contrary, before liberation, the laboring people of Hunyuan suffered quite a bit relying on this Northern Mountain Heng. There is an idiom in our country called "floods and fierce beasts," and these two happen to be specialties of Mount Heng. Speaking of snakes, as early as the Warring States period, Sun Wu Zi said: "The snake of Changshan (that is, Mount Heng) is called 'Shuairan'. If you strike its head, the tail will respond. If you strike its tail, the head will respond. If you strike its belly, the head and tail will respond." There are indeed quite a few people who have been harmed by fierce beasts and poisonous snakes in Mount Heng.

　　Even more terrible is the flood. Usually, the water flowing from Mount Heng to Tangyu is only 0.3 to 0.7 cubic meters per second, but when a flash flood occurs, it can be as high as more than 2,000 cubic meters per second. After this water is discharged from Jinlongkou, it rushes towards Hunyuan City like a mad lion.

　　Of course, the people of Hunyuan were not willing to be swallowed up by this evil dragon. Every year, they spent a lot of manpower, financial resources, and materials to fight against the flood. The eight-meter-high and three-to-four-zhang-thick large stone dam at the foot of Jinlongkou in Hunyuan City is a project for people to fight against the flood disasters of Mount Heng. In order to build this large stone dam, in the years with the most labor, nearly every household in Hunyuan City, with seven or eight thousand households, had to spend an average of one labor day every three days. However, the dam increased by one chi, and the river grew by ten inches. Due to the accumulation of sand and gravel and the rise of the riverbed, the dam was added to year after year, but the dam did not seem to be higher, and instead became more and more difficult to defend against, and the danger became increasingly serious. Now, the riverbed is already fifty meters higher than the Hunyuan City pass. When a flood comes, it rushes straight to densely populated areas from a commanding position. In this way, the flood disasters of Mount Heng have been inherited year after year until the eve of liberation.

　　In history, there are many records of the collapse of Mount Heng, the overflow of the Hun River, and the submersion of Hunyuan City. Not to mention the distant past, the tragedy of the flood in Hunyuan City on the 29th day of the fifth lunar month in 1939 is still deeply embedded in people's memories today. In the morning, Hunyuan City was still in good condition. After the meal, the dam suddenly breached, and in the blink of an eye, it turned into a vast flood. After a few hours, the flood receded, and some of the green tiled courtyards were gone without a trace, leaving only a pool of mud. In this flood, more than 4,000 people in Hunyuan City, with a population of 30,000, died tragically.

　　Once bitten by a snake, three years afraid of a rope. The people of Hunyuan, who had experienced the flood disaster, became restless and frightened at the sound of thunder. The elderly trembled and chanted: "May Mount Heng protect us..." But where is "Mount Heng"?

　　It is not "Mount Heng" that truly protects the people, but the Party and Chairman Mao. Since liberation, the Party and the state have allocated tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan every year to help the people of Hunyuan strengthen their defenses and overcome flood disasters. As soon as the flood season arrives, as soon as a flood report comes on the phone, whether it is a rainy dusk or a thundering midnight, the flood control commanders, headed by the county party secretary and the county magistrate, immediately rush to the dike. They rush to whichever position is the most dangerous. In the past ten years, although there have been several major floods, no major disaster has occurred under the rescue of thousands of troops and horses. In accordance with the spirit of combining treatment and prevention, the Party and the state have also led the people of Hunyuan to carry out large-scale afforestation and soil and water conservation on Mount Heng, which has greatly reduced water loss and soil erosion on 70% of the area, thus achieving the effect of storing water, blocking sand, and slowing runoff. In this way, not only has the flood disaster of Mount Heng been alleviated, and people's lives stabilized, but also land yields have increased year by year. By 1958, the barren land on the mountains and down the valleys had increased from less than 100 jin per mu in the early days of liberation to 135 jin. More than 60,000 mu of good land along the river that had been washed into sandy beaches by floods had gradually resumed cultivation due to flood protection. In the ten years from 1939 to 1949, almost no new houses appeared in Hunyuan City, which was flooded with ruins and broken walls everywhere, because who knew when the flood would swallow people and houses together, who would have the mind to build on a large scale? But since liberation, especially in the past two years, power stations, bus stations, schools, shops, processing plants, dormitories... have sprung up. A newly built road runs through the city. Hunyuan City has begun its new life.

　　In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the Party put forward the task of eradicating flood disasters and turning water disasters into water conservancy. According to the plan for the comprehensive management of the Hun River, it was decided to build the Hengshan Reservoir. This is much better than the plan to divert the river westward that people have been looking forward to for many years. Jinlongkou, this man-eating blood mouth, has been closed. From then on, the tragic history of flood control ended its last chapter, and a happy life began.

　　Although the Hengshan Reservoir is a jointly run by the people and assisted by the government, and more than 20 million workdays are borne by the people of the county, the state still has to take out more than 3 million yuan for material costs, machine rental fees, and technician wages. This investment is equivalent to all the public grain in the county from 1949 to 1954 for six years. This reservoir is designed according to a flood that occurs once in a century and checked according to a flood that occurs once in five hundred years. In this way, even if a flood that occurs once in five hundred years occurs, the people of Hunyuan can rest easy.

    高山巨坝锁蛟龙
    姚文锦
    被称为五岳之一的恒山因形势雄壮而有塞北第一山之称。著名的恒山十八景——金鸡、王年、琴棋台、白云洞、石脂图、飞石窟、玄武井、夕阳岭等……，不知吸引过多少游人。但今天更加引人注目的却是被誉为第十九景的恒山水库。
    从浑源城南行七里，便进了唐峪，唐峪是桑干河最大支流——浑河的一个发源地，它的东边连着海拔二千多公尺高的恒山主峰——玉华山峪内高与天齐的悬崖绝壁如同巨斧劈开的一般，大有“黄鹤之飞尚不得，猨猱欲度愁攀缘”的气势，前人喻之为塞北的“剑门天险”。
    入峪二里许，就到了“三根马尾吊在半岭”的悬岭寺，这座寺是恒山十八景中的一景。所谓“三根马尾”不过是一种夸张，真的悬岭寺是在三十米高的峭壁上靠着一块突出的岩石修建的。前面支撑着碗口粗的几十根长木柱，远远望去，危梯相通的层楼飞阁，上不着天，下不着地，真如在半空悬吊着一样，“云深结海楼”的意境，宛然在目。
    由悬岭寺南行数十步，转过一个湾，便看到恒山的第十九景——水库，秀丽的夕阳岭、神妙的白云洞与之相比，固不足道，即使是“令人叹观止矣”的悬岭寺，和水库大坝一比，也顿觉黯然失色了。三丈六的城墙算是高的了，而这个拱坝比城墙要高五六倍。吊在半空的悬岭寺简直不能望其项背。高还算不了什么，高而且薄，就更使人啧啧称奇了。水库工程指挥部主任袁步澧同志谈，如果在这里修个土坝，就需要三百多米厚，而今天我们所看到的这个混凝土拱坝，顶宽不过二米半，连坝底也只十五米宽，比修土坝要节省50％至80％的人力。站在山顶俯视，大坝像插在唐峪当腰的一块玻璃板，这样薄的高拱坝，据说在我国还是头一次出现。七个工程师和技术员根据既要安全又要经济的原则（坝身的厚度每减少一米即可节省八万多元的造价），专为计算这个坝身的“应力”（拱身承受外界压力的力量），抱着四架计算机，没日没夜地摇了两个多月。他们除了计算坝身对水压力的“应力”外，还计算了对冰压力、浪压力、风压力、地震力、拉力、气温变化等各种“应力”。总之，一切可能影响坝身安全的自然现象，他们都计算到了。尽管这样，国家还在坝内埋设了许多观测温度、沉陷、变位、水温等的仪器，这些仪器好比一付听诊器，坝身有了任何一点小毛病，一看便知，就能立即采取防预措施，因此人们说这里不是靠坝来挡水，而是靠科学挡水。
    这个水库的全部竣工将使恒山面貌为之一新，那时可蓄水一千七百多万公方，面积有几千亩大的人工湖，就会像一面镜子一样，在恒山群峰的环抱中闪放银光。那时人们称为“有山没水”的塞北第一山——北岳恒山，那时将真正是湖光山色、风景宜人了。但是，恒山水库决不只是装饰河山而已，重要的是它能灌溉浑源川下的八千一百多亩土地，它能每年发出三百三十度电力，还能用来发展养鱼、养鸡等多种经济。而且对于减少永定河、桑干河的含砂量（浑河每年即输出三百四十万公方泥砂，是永定河泥砂的主要来源之一），维护官厅、十三陵等兄弟水库的寿命，保卫可爱的首都北京，都有直接的意义。不过，对于恒山脚下的二十万浑源人民来说，永远难忘的是彻底解除了恒山洪害。
    恒山是个风景优美的游览胜地和避暑胜地，但是旧社会里饥寒交迫的劳动人民并没有那样的“福分”。相反，浑源的劳动人民解放前靠上这个北岳恒山，确是受害不少。我国有一句成语叫“洪水猛兽”，而这两宗正好都是恒山的特产。就说蛇吧，早在战国时代的孙武子就说过：“常山（就是恒山）之蛇曰‘率然’，击其首则尾应，击其尾则首应，击其腹则首尾俱应。”在恒山被猛兽毒蛇伤害了的人真是为数不少。
    更可怕的还是洪水。平时，从恒山流到唐峪的水不过零点三到零点七秒公方，但当山洪骤发之际，它可以大到两千秒公方以上。这股水从金龙口泻出以后，像一头发了疯的狮子一样，向浑源城扑去。
    浑源人民当然不甘心被这只恶龙吞掉。每年都拿出很多的人力、财力、物力向洪害搏斗。金龙口下浑源城那长达八米多高、厚三、四丈的护城大石坝，就是人们借以向恒山洪害进行搏斗的一个工事，为了修建这个大石坝，用工最多的年份，七、八千户的浑源城差不多平均每户三天就得花费一个劳动日。但是坝增一尺，河长十寸，由于砂石的冲积，河床的抬高，年年加坝，坝并不见高，反而防不胜防，危险性日益严重。现在，河床比浑源城关竟已高出五十米了，洪水一来便以居高临下之势，浩浩荡荡直奔人烟稠密之地。就这样，恒山洪害年甚一年地一直遗传到解放前夕。
    历史上恒山崩，浑河溢，浑源城被淹没的记载，累累皆是。远的不说，1939年阴历5月29日水淹浑源城的惨状，直到今天还深深地嵌在人们记忆中。早上，还是好端端的一个浑源城，饭后，大坝突然决口，眨眼之间，就变成一片茫茫洪水，几小时后洪水退去，有好些青悠悠的瓦房院连个影儿也没了，留下的只是一汪稀泥。这次水灾，三万人口的浑源城，就有四千余人死于非命。
    一朝被蛇咬，三年怕麻绳，历经洪水浩劫的浑源人民听到一声雷，就坐卧不安，心惊肉跳，老人们更是颤梭地念着：“恒山爷保佑……”，然而“恒山爷”又在哪里呢？
    真正保佑人民的不是“恒山爷”，是党，是毛主席。解放以来，党和国家每年都要拿出几万或几十万元的防洪款，帮助浑源人民加固堤防，战胜洪害。一入汛期，只要电话中一传来洪汛，不论是大雨滂沱的黄昏，还是雷电交加的午夜，以县委书记、县长为首的防洪指挥人员，马上奔到堤防上去。哪一块阵地最危险，他们就奔到那一块阵地。十年中，虽然有好几次特大的洪水，但在千军万马的抢救下，都未酿成巨祸。根据治标与治本相结合的精神，党和国家还领导浑源人民在千沟万壑的恒山上，大搞植树造林和水土保持，从而在70％的水土流失面积上大大收到了蓄水拦砂、减缓径流之效。这样，不但减轻了恒山的洪害，安定人民生活，土地产量也逐年提高。到1958年，山上山下的贫瘠土地已由解放初期的亩产不满百斤提高到一百三十五斤了。六万多亩被洪水冲成砂滩的沿河好地，也因为有了防洪的保障而逐渐恢复了耕种。从1939年到1949年的十年中，被洪水冲得到处残垣断壁的浑源城，几乎没有一间新房子出现，因为说不定何年何月洪水会连人带房子一齐吞掉，谁还有大兴土木的心思。但是从解放以来，特别是近二年来，发电站、汽车站、学校、商店、加工厂、宿舍……纷纷出现。一条新修的马路横贯全城。浑源城开始了它的新生活。
    大跃进的1958年，党提出了根除洪害、变水害为水利的任务，按照全面治理浑河的规划，决定兴建恒山水库。这比人们多少年来盼望的导河西下的计划不知要强多少倍。金龙口这个吃人的血口被封闭了，从此，悲惨的防洪史结束了最后的一章，幸福的生活开始了。
    恒山水库虽然是民办公助，两千多万个工由全县人民负担，但是国家仍要拿出三百余万元的材料费、机器租赁费和技工工资。这笔投资即相当于全县1949年至1954年的六年的全部公粮。这个水库是按百年一遇的洪水来设计、按五百年一遇的洪水来校核的。这样，即使遇到五百年一遇的洪水，浑源人民也可以高枕无忧了。
