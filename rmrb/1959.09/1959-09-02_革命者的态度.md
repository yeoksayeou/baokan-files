    The Attitude of a Revolutionary
    Wu Lü
    Today, this newspaper publishes news of the Zhang Chuanrui tunneling team of the Yucun Coal Mine, Xinwen Mining Bureau, Shandong, completing their annual tunneling plan ahead of schedule, Deng Mingjun, a fourth-grade vehicle maintenance worker at the Hongdu Machinery Factory in Jiangxi Province, completing a year's work in half a year, and thirty-five young workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory completing their annual workload ahead of schedule and entering 1960. These news items fully demonstrate what a heroic and revolutionary class the working class is. They are fearless in the face of difficulties, and nothing can frighten them.
    However, right-leaning opportunists are easily frightened. Being dizzy with success is common. After each high tide of the mass revolutionary movement arrives, some right-leaning opportunists always shout from the sidelines: "Terrible! It's too fast, too excessive, something will go wrong." Being dizzy with difficulties is also common. In the eyes of right-leaning opportunists, any small difficulty on our road forward is an insurmountable mountain or sea. Since the beginning of this year, haven't there been some very pessimistic arguments? Even some tasks that could have been completed based on objective conditions and subjective efforts are seen by them as absolutely impossible to accomplish.
    But what is the reality? The reality is that what lies before us are only some individual, temporary difficulties; these difficulties are completely surmountable and are being constantly overcome. Didn't the Zhang Chuanrui tunneling team encounter difficulties in completing their annual tunneling plan ahead of schedule? They did. Fourteen of the fifteen members of the team were new workers who arrived at the mine successively in the fourth quarter of last year. Isn't this a great difficulty? The workers who arrived earlier were not frightened by the difficulties. Instead, they taught the latecomers, lecturing above ground and practicing underground, and the level of the new workers improved rapidly. After the tunneling speed increased, the work of transporting and supporting could not keep up, which resulted in a new imbalance. For right-leaning opportunists, "imbalance" is a terrible thing. However, the Zhang Chuanrui team was not intimidated by the imbalance. They adopted a correct attitude, promoted advanced experience, and innovated in every work procedure, resulting in a comprehensive improvement in production levels and a new balance.
    The Zhang Chuanrui team is just one of thousands of ordinary production teams. Their attitude towards difficulties reflects the attitude of thousands upon thousands of workers. In their view, "Difficulties are like springs; it depends on how strong you are. If you are strong, they are weak; if you are weak, they are strong." This attitude is the true revolutionary's attitude towards difficulties. Right-leaning opportunists also call themselves "revolutionaries." Revolutionaries should understand that since it is a revolution, since it is necessary to transform the old world and build a new world, it is impossible not to encounter difficulties. The task of revolutionaries is to lead the masses to overcome difficulties. Being frightened by the slightest difficulty, is this the attitude of a revolutionary?

    革命者的态度	吴滤
    今天本报发表的山东新汶矿务局禹村煤矿张传瑞掘进小组提前完成全年掘进计划、江西省洪都机械厂四级车管工邓明俊半年完成一年工作量和上海机床厂三十五个青年工人提前完成全年的工作量，跨进1960年的新闻，充分表明了工人阶级是一个多么英勇的革命的阶级，他们对困难无所畏惧，什么也吓不倒他们。
    可是，右倾机会主义分子却是很容易被吓昏的。胜利吓昏了头脑，这是常有的。每一次群众革命运动的高潮来到之后，总有一些右倾机会主义分子在一旁大叫大喊：“不得了！太快了，太过火了，要出毛病了。”困难吓昏了头脑，这也是常有的。在右倾机会主义分子看来，我们前进道路上的任何一个细小的困难，都是不可逾越的高山大海。今年以来，不是很有一些悲观的论调吗？甚至一些根据客观条件和主观努力本来可以完成的任务，在他们看来也是决计完不成的。
    事实又如何呢？事实是：摆在我们面前的不过是一些个别的，暂时的困难；这些困难是完全可以克服的，并且已经在不断克服中。张传瑞掘进小组提前完成全年的掘进计划难道没有遇到困难吗？遇到的。全组十五人中有十四人是去年第四季度先后到矿的新工人，这不是很大的困难吗？早来的工人并没有被困难吓昏。然而，他们带晚来的工人，井上讲、井下练，新工人的水平迅速提高了。待到掘进速度提高后，运搬、支架等工作又跟不上去了，这就是出现了新的不平衡情况。对于右倾机会主义分子说来，“不平衡”这是很可怕的。然而，张传瑞小组也没有被不平衡吓倒，他们采取了正确的态度，推广先进经验，做到道道工序有革新，结果全面提高了生产水平，达到了新的平衡。
    张传瑞小组不过是千千万万普通的生产小组中的一个。他们对待困难的态度，反映了千千万万工人的态度。在他们看来，“困难像弹簧，看你强不强；你强他就弱，你弱他就强。”这种态度是真正的革命家对待困难的态度。右倾机会主义分子也自称是“革命家”。革命家总应该懂得既然是革命，既然是要改造旧世界，建设新世界，就不可能不遇到困难，革命家的任务就在于率领群众去战胜困难。遇到一星半点困难就被吓昏了，难道这是革命家的态度吗？
