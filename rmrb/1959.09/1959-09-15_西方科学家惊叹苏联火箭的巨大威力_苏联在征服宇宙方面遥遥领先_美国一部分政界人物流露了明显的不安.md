Xinhua News Agency Report: The glorious achievement of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reaching the moon according to plan has caused a great reaction in Western countries.

    Minutes after TASS announced that the rocket had landed on the moon, Dr. Dryden, Deputy Director of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, issued a statement saying: "We are watching with concern the Soviet rocket's exploration of the moon. We congratulate our (Soviet) fellow scientists and engineers on their achievements in this advanced step in space exploration."

    Dr. Roberts, director of the High Altitude Observatory at the University of Colorado, said: "This amazing achievement once again proves that the Russians have been able to guide very powerful rockets with great precision."

    Commenting on the news of the Soviet rocket landing on the moon, United Press International wrote: "It hit a target 230,000 miles from Earth, an event that marks the first time humans have launched an object to a celestial body, putting the Soviets far ahead in the race to conquer space." The news agency emphasized that the Soviet lunar rocket's "miraculous launch achieved the highest degree of accuracy," arriving "almost exactly on time" on the moon.

    While scientists marveled at the Soviet Union's scientific and technological achievements, some American politicians expressed obvious unease. US Senator Mansfield acknowledged that the Soviet Union's launch of a lunar rocket was "an amazing scientific achievement," but at the same time, he urged the American people not to "panic" over the Soviet Union's achievement as they did when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite. Another Senator, Humphrey, also expressed concern that the Soviet Union's achievement, coupled with its other achievements in space exploration, would "have a huge psychological impact on the current world situation."

    British scientists and technical experts warmly congratulated their Soviet counterparts. Professor Lovell, director of the Jodrell Bank Observatory, who had been observing the Soviet cosmic rocket until it reached the moon, held a press conference, saying that the achievement of the lunar rocket "brilliantly demonstrates the high level of Soviet scientific and technological development. Manipulating such a device 250,000 miles from the ground is indeed an amazing achievement."

    He emphasized that "such accurate launching of rockets is surprising." This achievement has put the Russians "definitely ahead."

    Gatland, vice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, said: "This is a historic moment for mankind. Obviously, this is a very great achievement, unprecedented in the history of rocketry. This means that the Russians not only have very large multi-stage rockets, but also have the ability to hit targets with these rockets with a high degree of accuracy. There is no evidence that the West can do this."

    The Daily Mirror wrote, "Russian scientists are at least five years ahead of their American counterparts in making rocket engines. Soviet rocket fuel experts have achieved extremely amazing achievements." The Birmingham Post wrote: Russia's launching of a large rocket to the moon proves that it is at the forefront of world science and technology.

    The news of the cosmic rocket reaching the moon also caused an unprecedented sensation in France. All newspapers reported the event on the front page and published photos, charts and other information. The newspapers used headlines such as: "Russian Cosmic Rocket Reaching the Moon is an Unprecedented Feat," "Reaching the Moon is an Amazing Achievement," "Rocket Launched by Humans Reaches the Moon for the First Time," "Mankind's Long-Cherished Ideal Has Become a Reality," "Amazing Achievements Are Warmly Welcomed Around the World."

    Le Combat acknowledged in an editorial that "Soviet science occupies an indisputable leading position."

    Professor Oberth, a West German scientist studying space flight, said: "This is a remarkable achievement!"

    The Bonn General-Anzeiger acknowledged in a commentary that "the fact that this rocket accurately reached its destination greatly enhanced the Soviet Union's prestige." The newspaper also believed that the Americans would feel "very embarrassed" in contrast to the Soviet Union's glorious achievement. A scientist from the West German Observatory and Rocket Station, Kaminski, put it well that the success of the Russian cosmic rocket in reaching the moon can be compared to a sharpshooter hitting a fly's eye with a small-caliber rifle ten kilometers away.

    西方科学家惊叹苏联火箭的巨大威力
    苏联在征服宇宙方面遥遥领先
    美国一部分政界人物流露了明显的不安
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联第二个宇宙火箭按照预定计划到达月球的光辉成就，在西方国家中引起了巨大的反响。
    在塔斯社宣布火箭在月球着陆的消息后几分钟，美国“全国星际和空间航行局”副局长德莱登博士发表声明说：“我们关切地注视着苏联探索月球的火箭飞到月球这件事。我们祝贺我们的（苏联）同行科学家和工程师在这一探索空间的先进步骤中取得的成就。”
    美国科罗拉多大学高空观测所所长罗伯茨说：“这一惊人成就再一次证明俄国人已经能够非常精确地引导威力巨大的火箭。”
    合众国际社在评论苏联火箭在月球着陆的消息时写道：“它击中了一个距离地球二十三万英里的靶子，这一事件标志着人类头一次把一件物体投掷到一个天体上去，这就使苏联人在征服空间的竞赛中遥遥领先。”这家通讯社着重提到，这次苏联月球火箭的“神奇发射达到了火箭的最高准确程度”，它“几乎一分不差地按时到达月球”。
    在科学家们惊叹苏联科学技术成就的同时，美国一部分政界人物却流露了明显的不安。美国参议员曼斯菲尔德承认苏联这次发射月球火箭是“一个惊人的科学成就”，但是他同时要美国人民对于苏联这次的成就不要像在苏联发射第一颗人造卫星时那样“惊慌”。另一个参议员汉弗莱也表示担心苏联这次的成就加上苏联在空间探测方面的其他成就将“对目前世界局势产生巨大的心理上的影响”。
    英国科学家和技术专家热烈祝贺他们的苏联同行。一直在观察着苏联宇宙火箭直到它到达月球为止的焦德雷耳班克天文台台长洛佛耳教授举行了记者招待会，他说，月球火箭的成就“光辉地展示了苏联科学技术发展的高度水平。操纵这种离地二十五万英里的装置确是惊人的成就”。
    他强调说，“如此准确的发射火箭是令人惊讶的。”这个成就已经使俄国人“肯定地走在前面了。”
    英国星际学会副主席加特兰说：“这是对人类有历史意义的时刻。显然这是一个极伟大的成就，是火箭学史上空前未有的。这意味着俄国人不仅拥有非常大的多级火箭，而且他们有能力以高度的准确性把这些火箭击中目标。还没有证据证明西方可以做到这一点。”
    “每日镜报”写道，“在制造火箭发动机方面俄国科学家起码要比他们的美国同行早走了五年。苏联火箭燃料专家取得了极为惊人的成就”。“伯明翰邮报”写道：俄国把一个大火箭发射到月球证明，它走在全世界科学技术的前面。
    宇宙火箭到达月球的消息在法国也引起了空前的轰动。所有报纸都在第一版报道了这个事件，并且刊登了照片、图表和其他资料。报纸用了这样一些标题：“俄国宇宙火箭到达月球是史无前例的丰功伟绩”，“到达月球是一个惊人的功绩”，“人类发射的火箭第一次到达月球”，“人类长期以来的理想变成了现实”，“惊人的成就受到全世界热烈欢迎”。
    “战斗报”在社论中承认“苏联科学占有无可争辩的领先地位”。
    西德研究宇宙飞行的科学家奥贝特教授说：“这是一个了不起的成就！”
    波恩“总汇报”在评论中承认，“这支火箭准确地到达目的地这件事使苏联的威信有了巨大的提高。”这家报纸还认为，在苏联这一光辉成就的相形之下，美国人会感到“很难堪”。西德天文台和火箭站的一个科学家卡明斯基说得好，俄国人的宇宙火箭成功地到达月球，这个成就可以同一个神枪手在十公里以外，用一支小口径步枪击中一只苍蝇的眼睛相比。
