To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic will carry out a 15-day Mongolian-Chinese friendship activity.

    The person in charge of the Mongolian Peace and Friendship Organization told our reporter today about the significance and tasks of this friendship activity, saying that the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided to carry out this activity in order to further consolidate the traditional friendship between the people of Mongolia and China and to introduce the achievements of China's socialist construction to the Mongolian people more widely. Therefore, publicizing the brilliant achievements made by New China in the past ten years is an important part of the friendship activities.
