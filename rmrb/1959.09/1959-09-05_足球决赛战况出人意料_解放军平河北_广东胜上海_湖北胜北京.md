Xinhua News Agency, September 4th. The twelve strong football teams participating in the First National Games football finals played six fierce matches in Beijing and Tianjin this afternoon. Unexpected situations emerged in each group: In the first group, the People's Liberation Army team drew with the Hebei team with a score of 1-1, and the Jilin team defeated the Heilongjiang team 5-2; in the second group, the Guangdong team defeated the Shanghai team 5-1, and the Liaoning team defeated the Sichuan team 3-1; in the third group, the Hubei team defeated the Beijing team 1-0, and the Shaanxi team defeated the Jiangsu team 2-0.

To date, only four teams, Hebei, PLA, Guangdong, and Hubei, remain undefeated among the twelve teams.

In Beijing, more than 40,000 spectators flocked to the magnificent Beijing Workers' Stadium, which was opened for the first time, to watch the match. The match between the PLA team and the Hebei team was the most intense. The PLA team had the advantage in the match. In the 17th minute of the first half, forward Ha Zengguang scored the first goal, making it 1-0. One minute before the end of the match, the Hebei team, after a relentless counter-attack, finally tied the score 1-1 due to a penalty kick opportunity.

In Tianjin, the rising star Guangdong team played against the strong team Shanghai today. At the beginning, both sides launched a fierce battle. Ten minutes into the match, Guangdong team's center forward Huang Fuxiao intercepted a ball about 30 meters in front of the opponent's goal, and passed it in with a long kick. The left winger Yang Feisun immediately caught up and scored a goal. After losing the goal, the Shanghai team was not discouraged and adopted a high-pass breakthrough, making full use of the left wing to actively organize a counter-attack. In the 35th minute, Shanghai team's left winger Ma Jinsheng dribbled the ball in, taking advantage of the opportunity when the opponent's goalkeeper came out to save the ball, cleverly avoided the opponent's defender, and gently pushed the ball into the net, tying the first half 1-1. In the second half, the Shanghai team played very bravely. However, because the four defenders of the Guangdong team closely marked the opponent's forwards and paid special attention to the left wing of the Shanghai team, the skilled Shanghai team could not exert its due power. In the eighth minute of the second half, Guangdong team's right inside forward Guan Huifang took a "free kick" at the right corner of the Shanghai team's goal. The ball flew into the net in an arc, this shot was very beautiful and won warm applause from the audience. In the 19th minute, Guan Huifang took a long shot from 25 meters away from the Shanghai team's goal. The ball caught the Shanghai team's goalkeeper by surprise and was shot into the net. Afterwards, the Guangdong team took advantage of the victory and launched a fierce attack, scoring two more goals in a row, finally forming an overwhelming advantage.

The first phase of the finals will continue on September 7.

    足球决赛战况出人意料
    解放军平河北　广东胜上海　湖北胜北京
    新华社4日讯　参加第一届全国运动会足球决赛的十二个足球劲旅，今天下午分别在北京、天津两地进行了六场激烈的比赛。每个组都出现了出人意料的情况：第一组解放军队与河北队以一比一踢成平局，吉林队以五比二胜黑龙江队；第二组广东队以五比一胜上海队，辽宁队以三比一胜四川队；第三组湖北队以一比零胜北京队，陕西队以二比零胜江苏队。
    至此，十二个队中一直保持不败的队只剩下了河北、解放军、广东和湖北四个队。
    在北京，四万多名观众涌到第一次开放使用的雄伟壮丽的北京工人体育场观看比赛。在今天的比赛中，解放军队和河北队的比赛最激烈。解放军队在比赛中占了优势，上半场第十七分钟时前锋哈增光首先射进一球，造成一比零的局面。终场前一分钟，努力反攻的河北队由于获得了罚十一米球的机会，终于扳成一比一的平局。
    在天津，后起之秀的广东队今天和实力雄厚的劲旅——上海队比赛，一开始，双方就展开激战。比赛进行到十分钟时，广东队中锋黄福孝在对方门前三十米左右的地方截得一球，大脚传中，埋伏在对方阵地的左边锋杨霏荪立即赶上一脚，射进一球。上海队失球后毫不气馁，采用高传突破，并充分利用左边锋线，积极组织反攻。三十五分钟时，上海队左边锋马津生带球切入，趁对方守门员外出扑球的机会，巧妙地避过对方后卫的阻击，将球轻拨入网内，上半场以一比一踢平。下半场上海队打的十分勇猛，由于广东队的四个后卫人盯人紧逼对方前锋，并特别注意看牢上海队的左翼，使得技术熟练的上海队不能发挥应有的威力。在比赛进行到八分钟时，广东队右内锋关辉舫在上海队球门右角主罚“任意球”，球成弧线飞入网内，这个球打的十分漂亮，博得全场的观众热烈鼓掌。十九分钟时，关辉舫在上海队球门二十五米处大脚长射，这个球出乎上海队守门员的意料，被射入网内。此后，广东队乘胜猛攻，又连进两球，最后形成压倒的优势。
    第一阶段决赛将在9月7日继续举行。
