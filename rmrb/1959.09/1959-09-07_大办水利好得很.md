Building Water Conservancy on a Large Scale is Very Good

Since the winter of 1957, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the people of our country, with the firm belief that man can conquer nature, have launched an unprecedented large-scale water conservancy movement across the country to "tame floods and conquer droughts." This high tide of water conservancy construction, combined with the high tide of agricultural production that began in the first half of 1958, promoted the development of the people's commune movement. After the realization of people's communes in rural areas nationwide, a new situation emerged in water conservancy construction. Relying on this newborn social organization, people greatly increased their strength in the fight against natural disasters, and not only successfully completed a large number of medium and small-scale water conservancy projects, but also completed many arduous large-scale water conservancy projects.

Recently, the successful flood control of the Miyun Reservoir once again vividly demonstrated the miracles created by the General Line, the People's Commune, and the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy work. To build such a large comprehensive reservoir in North China with a water storage capacity of 4.1 billion cubic meters and an earth and stone dam twenty times larger than the Guanting Reservoir would have taken five years in the past. However, the heroic people of Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality aimed to achieve flood control in one year and completion in two years. This year, continuous heavy rains fell in the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, and the Chaobai River repeatedly experienced flood peaks, with a maximum flood peak flow of 3,100 cubic meters per second. If these floods had been allowed to flow downstream, several million people and four million mu of farmland would have suffered severe flooding. However, thanks to the 200,000 civilian workers and troops at the Miyun Reservoir construction site who rushed to repair the flood control dam before the arrival of the flood, 850 million cubic meters of floodwater were retained, and the outflow from the reservoir was only 400 cubic meters per second, which not only completely eliminated the downstream flood disaster but also greatly reduced the waterlogging disaster. The flood control of the Miyun Reservoir precisely illustrates that the General Line of socialist construction fully reflects the urgent aspirations and fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people. The people of Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, who suffered deeply from water disasters, were able to eliminate this year's catastrophic disaster under the guidance of the General Line by exerting great efforts and achieving flood control at the Miyun Reservoir in one year. The flood control of the Miyun Reservoir in one year also vividly illustrates the great superiority of the People's Commune. It was precisely because of the People's Commune that the people of twenty counties, including both beneficiary and non-beneficiary areas, were able to mobilize 200,000 young and strong laborers, and were able to smoothly relocate and resettle 11,000 households in the reservoir area, coupled with the strong support of various provinces, cities, and units across the country, that they were able to conquer the floodwaters of the Chaobai River in one year. The giant dam that rose in North China in one year, the Miyun Reservoir, is a powerful proof of the complete correctness of the General Line of socialist construction and the great victory of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune!

The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune not only enabled the Miyun Reservoir to control floods and tame the Chaobai River flood in one year, but also enabled five large reservoirs in Hebei Province, including Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Xidayang, Wangkuai, and Hengshanling, to control floods and tame the floodwaters of the Hutuo River, the southern branch of the Daqing River, and the Ci River; enabled the Qinghe Reservoir in Liaoning Province to control floods and tame the floodwaters of the Qing River; enabled the Xiashijiazhuang Reservoir in Shanxi Province to control floods and tame the floodwaters of the Fen River; enabled the Zhaopingtai Reservoir in Henan Province to control floods and tame the floodwaters of the Sha River; and enabled the Songtao Reservoir in the distant Hainan Island in southern China to control floods and grasp the central hub for developing water conservancy on Hainan Island. In the past year, a total of tens of millions of large, medium, and small reservoirs across the country have been built by the hands of the members of the People's Commune, playing a huge role in this year's fight against floods and droughts.

Is it good or bad to build water conservancy on such a large scale? The Central Flood Control Headquarters' flood control bulletin for July and August answered this question. The great flood in Hebei Province in 1939 inundated 71 million mu of farmland, and the floodwater flooded Tianjin for more than two months. At that time, in Wen'an County, 429 out of 542 households in one village sold their property, and 327 households fled famine. This year, central and northern Hebei Province experienced continuous heavy rainstorms, but due to the water conservancy projects built over the years, especially the large-scale management of the Hai River since the Great Leap Forward last year, 8.9 billion cubic meters of floodwater were retained this year, of which the newly built reservoirs alone retained 4.5 billion cubic meters. All major rivers were not breached, avoiding direct inundation of downstream areas by floods and greatly facilitating the drainage of waterlogged areas in the plains, ensuring the safety of Tangshan City. This is proof of the significant role of large-scale water conservancy in preventing and mitigating flood disasters.

Turning to drought, the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Sichuan in central China experienced very little rainfall in July and August this year, with rainfall in many areas being less than one-quarter of the average rainfall in previous years, resulting in a rare summer drought. The accumulated drought-affected area reached 320 million mu, and the filling and grouting of autumn crops were greatly threatened. In 1942, Henan also experienced such a severe drought, with crop failures, barren land for thousands of miles, and more than three million deaths. This year, under the threat of the same severe drought, Henan is not barren land for thousands of miles, but has reaped a bumper harvest of early autumn crops and is expecting a bumper harvest of late autumn crops; instead of more than one million deaths, more than 20 million laborers have been mobilized to declare war on drought. In more than a month, many new water conservancy projects have been built, bringing irrigation benefits to more than 10 million mu, and enabling 80 million mu of autumn fields to be watered. This year, drought-stricken areas across the country have relied on the People's Commune and used the large number of water conservancy facilities built over the past decade, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, to make overall arrangements for labor, enabling more than 200 million mu of crops to be irrigated to varying degrees in the scorching heat and drought.

The people of our country deeply realize that in order to get rid of poverty and eliminate disasters as soon as possible, we can only, under the leadership of the Party, use our own laboring hands to build water conservancy on a large scale, build more water conservancy, and build water conservancy quickly. It is not surprising that imperialists and domestic hostile elements attack large-scale water conservancy. Because they do not want the Chinese people to be able to quickly get rid of frequent water and drought disasters, they only hope that we will always remain in a state of poverty and backwardness. At the same time, a small number of people with ulterior motives in the country are also pointing fingers, spreading pessimistic emotions, saying that we have built too much water conservancy, too fast, and have made a mess of water conservancy. Is this the case?

Have we built a lot of water conservancy? Indeed, we have built a lot. In the past decade, we have begun the fundamental management of several major rivers such as the Yellow River, the Huai River, the Hai River, and the Liao River, and other rivers have also been subjected to necessary rectification to reduce water damage and develop water conservancy. The national irrigated area has increased from 230 million mu in 1949 to 1 billion mu this year, accounting for 57% of the national cultivated land area; the preliminary waterlogging control area is 210 million mu, accounting for 55% of the waterlogging-prone area. Such great achievements are impossible for any capitalist country to achieve in such a short period of time. However, compared with our country's vast territory, complex natural conditions, and the urgent demands of the masses for water management, water conservancy construction is not too much, but is still far from enough, and we must continue to do it with great strength. It can be seen from this year's situation that the more water conservancy is built, the smaller the water and drought disasters are. If we did not build so much water conservancy, the consequences would have been unimaginable if we had encountered such severe water and drought disasters this year.

Is the speed of water conservancy construction too fast? Like other construction, the speed of water conservancy construction in our country since liberation has indeed been very fast, greatly exceeding the speed of various capitalist countries, and was beyond the reach of the reactionary rule of old China. In the past two years, under the glorious illumination of the General Line, we have implemented the three-main water management policy of small-scale as the main, commune-run as the main, and water storage as the main, and the speed of water conservancy construction has become even faster than before. In the past, it took four or five years to build a larger reservoir, but now, for such a large project as the Miyun Reservoir, it can play a flood control role in one year; in the past, projects that required state investment to undertake can now be undertaken by a special zone or a county. In this way, many water conservancy projects that were originally expected to be completed in about ten years can now be built in only one or two years. What is wrong with such a high-speed water conservancy construction?

The main reason for saying that we have built too much and too fast is that we have ruined and messed up water conservancy because of too much and too fast, and they even say that we have turned water conservancy into water damage. However, the facts are exactly the opposite. The quality of our water conservancy construction projects is also rapidly improving. The characteristics of the water conservancy construction from the winter of 1957 to the Great Leap Forward in 1958 were wide coverage and large quantity, while the characteristics of the water conservancy construction from the winter of 1958 to 1959 were mainly large and medium-sized reservoirs with high quality. In the past, only state investment could build such reservoirs, so progress was very slow; now, the state and the commune jointly run them, continuing to promote the valuable experience of the Great Leap Forward such as the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, so the progress is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the quality is even better. This time, the construction of the Miyun Reservoir not only had the great communist collaboration of all parties, but also the great combination of science and labor. Several departments of Tsinghua University participated in the entire process of survey, design, and construction of the reservoir, combining learning with labor, teaching with production, and creative intellectual labor with heroic physical labor were inseparable; at the same time, the construction army of the reservoir carried out large-scale technological innovation and also used a large number of modern machines, becoming a demonstration project of mechanized construction, ensuring the particularly excellent quality of the reservoir. Is this ruining water conservancy because of too much and too fast? Furthermore, let's take the actual flood control power of our water conservancy projects. Many facts have shattered this fallacy. For example, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have not been breached for more than ten years since liberation, and last year it safely passed the great flood of 22,300 cubic meters per second. The Huai River has initially changed the old face of "heavy rain brings heavy disasters, light rain brings light disasters, and no rain brings drought disasters." This year, the Huai River basin suffered from severe drought, but the river network area in northern Anhui greatly reduced the drought disaster. Are these not ironclad facts? Many large and small water conservancy projects have played the role of flood control and water storage, ensuring the safety of industrial and agricultural production and transportation lines. Are these not facts? It should be said that it is not ruined, but done well.

Of course, in a large number of projects, the quality of a very small number of projects is not good enough, and some projects have encountered particularly large floods before they were completed, and some accidents have occurred. However, can all water conservancy projects in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, be so smooth and foolproof? Fundamentally controlling water and drought disasters is a serious struggle against nature; blocking rivers and building reservoirs is a great initiative to transform nature. People can only gradually enrich their experience and improve their technical level in practical struggles, so that the quality of projects is becoming more and more perfect. For our water conservancy projects, it should not be said that there are too many accidents, but that there are surprisingly few accidents. According to the communiqué of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, during the attacks of rainstorms in North China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia in July and August this year, only more than 400 of the more than 15,000 newly built medium and small-sized reservoirs had accidents of varying degrees, with an accident rate of about 3%. This little bit of shortcoming is simply less than a little finger out of ten fingers compared with the huge achievements of the people of our country.

The greatness of the achievements and the remarkable benefits of ten years of water conservancy construction can never be denied by any fallacy. Facts have proved that building water conservancy on a large scale is not ruined or messed up, but has achieved great achievements; it is not too much or too fast, but it is necessary to continue to build more and faster, and to strive to do better and more economically.

Our country has many rivers and very rich water and soil resources, and the development prospects are very broad. However, due to the old water conservancy foundation being too weak and long-term disrepair before liberation, our management time is still short, and the great work of eliminating harm and promoting benefits is just beginning. Water conservancy construction will still be an arduous task for the whole Party and the whole people for several years. In accordance with the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to realize the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, we should continue to carry out several large-scale water conservancy movements in the next few years to basically eliminate ordinary water and drought disasters nationwide. In order to further increase agricultural production next year, a mass-based large-scale water conservancy movement should be launched this winter and next spring, focusing on consolidating and improving existing engineering facilities, fully exerting the benefits of the project, and appropriately increasing new water conservancy facilities.

The current situation is very favorable for large-scale water conservancy: the people's communes in rural areas across the country have been rectified, and their superiority is being increasingly and significantly brought into play in various constructions, especially in building water conservancy; after several years of large-scale water conservancy movements, the "three-main" water management policy and the policy of combining large, medium, and small-sized water conservancy projects have taken deep root among the masses, and a group of water conservancy construction forces with certain technologies have been cultivated in rural areas; with the rapid development of our country's industry, industry will further support agriculture; at the same time, the great victory in this year's flood control and drought resistance struggle has powerfully encouraged and strengthened the masses' ambition to transform nature. Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, we should oppose right-leaning, encourage efforts, adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the mass line, actively prepare to organize forces, and welcome another large-scale and magnificent water conservancy construction movement this winter and next spring, and strive to realize the water conservancy construction goal in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

### 大办水利好得很

    大办水利好得很
    自从1957年冬季以来，我国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，以人定胜天的坚强信念，在全国各地掀起了一个史无前例的大规模的“驯服洪水、战胜旱灾”的水利运动。这个水利建设高潮同1958年上半年开始的农业生产高潮相汇合，曾经推动了人民公社运动的发展。在全国农村实现人民公社化以后，水利建设更出现了一个崭新的局面。人们依靠这个新生的社会组织，大大地增加了和自然灾害作斗争的力量，不仅胜利地完成了大量中小型水利工程，而且还完成了许多艰巨的大型水利工程。
    最近，密云水库的胜利拦洪又一次生动地显示了总路线、人民公社、大跃进在水利工作中创造的奇迹。建设这样一个蓄水四十一亿立方米、大坝土石方比官厅水库大二十倍以上的华北最大的综合性大型水库，在过去得要五年。但是，英勇的河北省和北京市人民，却要它一年拦洪、两年建成。今年潮白河上游连降暴雨，潮白河迭出洪峰，最大洪峰流量三千一百秒立方米，如果任凭这些洪水冲下，将使下游几百万人民、四百万亩田地遭受严重水灾。但是由于密云水库工地的二十万民工和部队在洪水到来之前抢修了拦洪大坝，拦蓄洪水八点五亿立方米，水库下泄流量只有四百秒立方米，不仅完全免除了下游洪灾，而且大大减轻了涝灾。密云水库的拦洪，正说明了社会主义建设总路线充分地反映了广大人民的迫切愿望和根本利益。河北省和北京市的人民深受水灾之苦，正是在总路线的指导下，鼓足干劲，使密云水库一年拦洪，免除了今年的没顶之灾。密云水库一年拦洪，也生动地说明了人民公社巨大优越性。正是由于有了人民公社，包括受益区和非受益区的二十个县人民能够出动了二十万青壮民工，能够顺利地迁出和安置了库区一万一千户居民，加上全国各省市和许多单位的大力支援，才能在一年内治服了潮白河的洪水。密云水库这个一年间在华北升起的巨坝，是社会主义建设总路线的完全正确和大跃进、人民公社的伟大胜利的有力证明！
    总路线、大跃进和人民公社，不仅使密云水库能够在一年内拦洪，治服了潮白河洪水，而且使河北省的岗南、黄壁庄、西大洋、王快、横山岭等五座大型水库能够拦洪，治服了滹沱河、大清河南支和磁河的洪水；使辽宁省的清河水库拦洪，治服了清河的洪水；使山西省的下石家庄水库能够拦洪，治服了汾河的洪水；使河南省昭平台水库能够拦洪，治服了沙河的洪水；使远处我国南方的海南岛的松涛水库能够拦洪，掌握了开发海南宝岛水利的中心枢纽。一年以来，总计全国数以千万计的大、中、小水库经过人民公社社员的双手建设起来，在今年抗洪抗旱的斗争中发挥了巨大的作用。
    这样大办水利，是好，还是不好呢？拿水灾来说，中央防汛总指挥部发表的7、8月份防汛公报答复了这个问题。1939年河北省的大水，淹没了农田七千一百万亩，洪水浸入天津市两个多月，当时文安县有一个村五百四十二户中就有四百二十九户变卖家产，有三百二十七户外出逃荒。今年河北省中部和北部连降特大暴雨，但由于过去历年来兴修水利，特别是去年大跃进以来大规模治理海河，今年拦蓄了八十九亿立方米的洪水，其中仅新建水库就拦蓄了四十五亿立方米，各主要河道均未决口，避免了下游地区洪水的直接淹没，并且大大地便利平原涝水的排泄，保证了唐山市的安全。这是大办水利对于防止和减轻洪水灾害的重大作用的证明。
    拿旱灾来说，我国中部河南、山东、安徽、湖北、江苏、湖南、江西、陕西、山西、四川等省区，今年7、8两月降雨很少，许多地方降雨量不及历年平均雨量的四分之一，发生了多年少有的伏期干旱，累计受旱面积达三点二亿亩，秋熟作物结实灌浆受到极大威胁。1942年，河南也曾出现过这样严重的旱情，作物失收，赤地千里，死亡三百多万人。今年在同样严重的旱情的威胁下，河南不是赤地千里，而是早秋作物丰收，晚秋作物丰收在望；不是死亡百余万人，而是出动两千多万劳动大军向干旱宣战，在一个多月的时间里就新修了很多水利工程，发挥了灌溉效益一千多万亩，并使八千万亩秋田得到了浇水。今年全国干旱地区依靠了人民公社，运用了十年来特别是1958年大跃进以来兴修的大量水利设施，统筹安排了劳动力，使二亿多亩农作物在酷热苦旱中得到了不同程度的灌溉。
    我国人民深刻体会到，要早日摆脱贫困、消灭灾荒，只有在党的领导下，用自己的劳动双手，大办水利，多办水利，快办水利。帝国主义和国内敌对分子攻击大办水利，是毫不足怪的。因为他们不希望中国人民能够迅速地摆脱频繁的水旱灾害，他们只希望我们永远停留在贫困落后的状态中。与此同时，国内一小部分别有用心的人也在指手划脚，散布悲观情绪，说什么我们水利办得太多了、太快了，把水利办糟了、办乱了。事实是不是这样的呢？
    我们的水利是否办得很多呢？确实办得很多。十年来我们开始了对黄河、淮河、海河、辽河等几条大江大河的根本的治理，其他河道也进行了必要的整治，减轻水害，开发水利。全国灌溉面积由1949年的二点三亿亩，增加到今年的十亿亩，占全国耕地面积的57％；初步治涝面积二点一亿亩，占易涝面积55％。这样伟大的成绩是任何资本主义国家在这样短短的时间内做不到的。但是，同我国广大的幅员、复杂的自然情况以及群众治水的迫切要求来比较，水利建设不是做得太多了，而是做得还很不够，还要继续用很大力量去做。从今年的情况可以看出，水利修得多的地方，水旱灾害就较小。假使我们不修这么多水利，今年遇到这样严重的水旱灾害，其后果是不堪设想的。
    水利建设速度是不是太快了呢？和其他建设一样，解放以来我国水利建设的速度确是很快的，大大超过了资本主义各国的速度，旧中国反动统治时期无法望其项背。近两年来在总路线光辉照耀下，贯彻了小型为主，社办为主，蓄水为主的三主治水方针，水利建设的速度比从前更加快了。过去建设一个较大的水库要四、五年时间，而现在像密云水库这样大的工程，一年就能起拦洪作用；过去要国家投资举办的工程，现在一个专区或者一个县就能办了。这样，许多在原来预计要十年左右才能完成的水利工程，现在只用一、两年的工夫修起来了。这样高速度的水利建设，有什么不好呢？
    说我们水利办得太多太快的人，据说主要的理由是因为多快就把水利办坏了，办乱了，他们甚至说我们把水利办成了水害。但是，事实恰恰相反，我国水利建设工程的质量也在迅速提高。1957年冬到1958年大跃进的水利建设的特点，是面广量大，而1958年冬到1959年的水利建设的特点是以质量高的大中型水库为主，这种水库过去只有国家投资才能建设，因此进展很慢；现在是国家和公社合办，继续发扬土洋结合等大跃进的宝贵经验，因而进度突飞猛进，而且质量更加优良。这次建设密云水库，不只有各方面的共产主义大协作，而且有科学和劳动的大结合，清华大学的几个系参加了这个水库的勘察、设计和施工的全部过程，学习与劳动结合，教学和生产结合，创造性的智力劳动和英雄式的体力劳动密不可分；同时水库的建设大军，大搞技术革新，还使用了大量的现代机械，成为机械化施工的示范工程，保证了水库质量特别优越。难道这是多快而把水利办坏了吗？再拿我们水利工程的实际防洪威力来说，许许多多事实粉碎了这种谬论。譬如黄河下游沿岸，自从解放后十多年来就没有决过口，去年还安然度过二万二千三百秒立方米的大洪水。淮河已经初步改变了“大雨大灾、小雨小灾、无雨旱灾”的旧面貌，今年淮域苦旱，而淮北河网地区，却大大减轻了旱灾。这些不都是铁的事实吗？许多大小水利工程都发挥了拦洪蓄水的作用，保证了工农业生产和交通线的安全。这些难道不是事实吗？应当说不是办糟了，而是办好了。
    当然，在大量的工程中，有极小一部分工程质量不够好，有的工程还没有做完就遇到特大洪水的袭击，曾经发生一些事故。但是，难道古今中外的所有水利工程，都能那么一帆风顺、万无一失吗？根治水旱灾害，这是对自然的严重斗争；拦断河流、兴修水库，这是改造自然的伟大创举，人们只有在实践斗争中逐步丰富经验，提高技术水平，使工程质量日趋完善。对于我们的水利工程，应该说的不是事故太多，而是事故令人惊异的少。据中央防汛指挥部的公报，今年7、8月华北、东北、内蒙古地区在暴雨的袭击下，一万五千多座新修的中小水库中，只有四百多座发生不同程度的事故，事故率约为3％。这一点点的缺点，同我国人民的巨大的成绩比较，简直是十个指头中还不到一个小指头而已。
    十年水利建设的成就的巨大，效益的显著，决不是任何谬论所能抹煞的。事实证明大办水利不是办糟了、办乱了，而是获得了巨大的成绩；也不是办得太多了太快了，而是要继续多办快办，要努力办得更好更省。
    我国河流众多，水土资源十分丰富，开发前途很大。但是由于旧有水利基础过于薄弱，解放前长期失修，我们治理的时间还短，除害兴利的巨大工作正在开始，水利建设在若干年内仍然是全党全民的一项繁重任务。按照党八届八中全会对于提前实现农业发展纲要的号召，我们应当再在几年内继续开展几次大规模的水利运动，在全国范围内基本上消灭普通水旱灾害。为了明年农业的进一步增产，今冬明春应当开展一个以巩固提高现有工程设施、充分发挥工程效益和适当增加新的水利设施为主要内容的群众性的大办水利运动。
    当前的形势对于大兴水利十分有利：全国农村人民公社经过整顿，它的优越性正在各项建设特别在兴修水利上日益显著地发挥出来；经过几年来大搞水利运动，“三主”治水方针和大中小型水利工程相结合的方针已在群众中扎下了深厚的基础，农村中已经培养出一批具有一定技术的兴修水利的力量；随着我国工业的迅速发展，工业对农业将有进一步的支援；同时，在今年防汛抗旱斗争中的伟大胜利，有力地鼓舞和加强群众改造自然的雄心壮志。我们应当在总路线的光辉照耀下，反右倾、鼓干劲，坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线，积极地准备组织力量，迎接今冬明春又一个声势浩大波澜壮阔的水利建设运动，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要中水利建设的目标而奋斗。
