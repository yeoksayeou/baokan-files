Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The Xingzhen People's Commune in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, is leveraging the advantages of its large-scale commune organization to actively assist low-yield areas in preparing for wheat planting, striving for balanced production increases across the entire commune.

Jiulongyuan, Lubotan, Changshouyuan, and Liujingshan are all low-yield areas within the commune. During the hottest days of summer, Jing Kebin, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, led 750 commune members from four management districts and eight production teams to Jiulongyuan to clear wasteland, apply green manure, and repair embankment edges. Over 35,000 mu of land that had never seen fertilizer in previous years was largely treated with ash fertilizer and green manure. To eliminate third-class wheat fields (referring to fields planted with wheat after a wheat crop) during the planting stage, all 16,000+ mu of corn, mung bean, and melon/fruit fields that had been harvested were deeply plowed, and over half had already received base fertilizer. The remaining 14,000+ mu of autumn fields needing to be planted with wheat after another crop had fertilizer piled up in advance at the edges of the fields in some cases.

Currently, all teams in the commune are working with great enthusiasm and confidence, rushing day and night to apply base fertilizer, harrow the soil to retain moisture, and prepare for planting.

    兴镇公社帮助低产区作好秋播准备
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省蒲城县兴镇人民公社利用公社组织规模大的有利条件，在播种小麦准备工作中，积极帮助低产区进行准备，争取全社平衡增产。
    九龙原、滷泊滩、长寿原、六井山，是全社的低产区。公社党委第一书记荆克斌在三伏天，率领四个管理区八个生产队的七百五十多个社员，到九龙原铲荒地、压青肥、修埝边，三万五千多亩历年见不到肥料的土地，大部分都施了灰肥和青肥。为了把三类麦田（指回茬麦田）消灭在播种关，各个生产队已经把收获过的一万六千多亩玉米、绿豆和瓜果地，全部进行过深翻，半数以上已经施了底肥；下余的一万四千多亩需要回茬小麦的秋田，有的已经把肥料提前堆放在地头。
    现在，全公社各个队都干劲十足，信心百倍地日夜突击，追施底肥，耙耘保墒，准备播种。
