Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 5th. The Indian Communist Party's "New Age" weekly recently published an article refuting the rampant slanders made by some Indian newspapers against the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The article stated, "The attitude taken by a section of the Indian press towards the communiqué of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the revision of the 1959 plan targets is quite shameless." These newspapers' recent hostile comments on China are "part of a uniform anti-China diatribe emanating from many quarters."

The article further pointed out that the purpose of these consistently anti-China Indian newspapers' clamoring is because they believe that anti-China propaganda has not been done "enough," and that "China's reputation must be undermined in more ways to isolate China from the people of our country who are particularly concerned about this Asian neighbor." The article said, "What better propaganda is there than to ridicule China's great economic development, which has made the deepest impression on our crisis-ridden country and its people."

The article then pointed out, "Worse still, this opportunity is not only being used to belittle China's economic development, but has become a heaven-sent opportunity for some people to justify the failures of our own plans and economic policies."

The article also mentioned the anti-China propaganda of imperialist countries and said, "The more bricks we throw at China, the more bouquets these imperialists offer to our country."

The article pointed out that China's output continues to grow with the continued leaps forward in all aspects. "It is too early to laugh if one does not compare the actual achievements with the target figures of the entire Second Five-Year Plan, and if one mocks the progress made year by year, and let the Chinese have the last laugh."

The article concluded, "In the face of these irrefutable facts, all talk of retreat and slump is simply nonsense."

    印度“新世纪”周刊驳斥一些印度报纸对我国的污蔑
    一切所谓跃退的议论都是废话
    新华社新德里5日电　印度共产党的“新世纪”周报最近一期发表了一篇文章，驳斥某些印度报纸对中国共产党八届八中全会公报和决议所进行的猖狂污蔑。
    文章说，“有一部分印度报纸对中国共产党中央委员会关于修改1959年计划指标的公报所采取的态度是很无耻的。”这些报纸最近对中国发表敌视的评论是“目前从许多方面发出的千篇一律的反华谰言的一部分”。
    文章进一步指出，这些一贯反华的印度报纸大叫大嚷的目的是由于它们认为反华宣传做得还“不够”，“还必须在更多方面破坏中国的声誉，以便把中国同特别关怀我们这个亚洲邻国的我国人民隔绝起来”。文章说，“还有什么比嘲笑中国伟大的经济发展更好的宣传办法呢，中国的经济发展给了我们这个笼罩着危机的国家及其人民以最深刻的印象”。
    文章接着指出，“更糟糕的是，这个机会不仅被用来轻视中国的经济发展，而且成了某些人为我国本身的计划和经济政策的失败作辩解的天赐机会”。
    这篇文章还提到帝国主义国家的反华宣传，并且说，“我们越向中国抛砖头，这些帝国主义者就越向我国献花束”。
    文章指出，中国的产量随着各方面的继续跃进而继续增长。“如果不把实际成绩同整个第二个五年计划的指标数字加以比较，如果看不到一年年的进展而加以嘲笑，未免笑得过早，而让中国人最后发笑。”
    文章最后说，“在这些无可辩驳的事实面前，一切关于跃退和跃跌的议论简直是废话”。
