Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 1st - The Soviet "Red Star" published an article on August 30th, commenting on the US imperialists' occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan, saying that any elementary school student would answer: Taiwan is a Chinese island. Everyone knows that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. The Chinese arrived in Taiwan before Columbus discovered America. Why is the United States now the master of Taiwan? The problem is clear: because the United States, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, occupied Taiwan and used it as a strategic base.

The article pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek dreams of returning to the mainland and is therefore increasing the number of his troops. His troops are trained by the United States and use American-made weapons. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has concentrated a large number of troops in Kinmen (Quemoy), which is intended to provoke People's China. It was in this area that the Chiang gang and its masters carried out large-scale military operations last summer and autumn.

The article emphasized that the US imperialist bloc closes its eyes to the actual situation, does not want to see the changes that have taken place on the world stage, and continues to treat China with old policies. This policy is called an absurd policy by foreign newspapers.

The article said that people all over the world hope for lasting and durable security, and they warmly agree with the policies adopted by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions. However, many facts prove that some representatives of the United States are unwilling to normalize international relations and are trying to maintain the "Cold War." When the Soviet Union proposed abolishing foreign military bases, they were disgusted. US Vice President Nixon also avoided answering the question raised by the Soviet press about abolishing foreign military bases during his visit to the Soviet Union. But this is not an insignificant issue, but an issue that concerns millions of people, because foreign military bases are a real threat to peace. The US military's occupation of Chinese islands and its military preparations, and its consistent armed provocations against the People's Republic of China – these all threaten the security of People's China and other countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

There is a Chinese saying, "One cannot allow others to snore beside one's bed." When China's ancient territory of Taiwan is still occupied by the Chiang gang, the Chinese people cannot feel safe. The aggressive policy of the United States is the fuse of this "time bomb" of Taiwan. Extinguishing the fuse and this bomb is the will of millions of people.

### 苏联“红星报”发表文章  斥美国侵占中国领土台湾  美国军事基地政策是对和平的实际威胁

    苏联“红星报”发表文章
    斥美国侵占中国领土台湾
    美国军事基地政策是对和平的实际威胁
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　苏联“红星报”8月30日发表文章，评论美国帝国主义者占领中国领土台湾说，任何一个小学生都会回答说：台湾是中国的岛屿。谁都知道，台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分，在哥仑布发现美洲之前，中国人就已到了台湾了，为甚么现在美国成了台湾的主人呢？问题很清楚，因为美国同蒋介石集团勾结，占领了台湾，把它当作了战略基地。
    文章指出，蒋介石梦想返回大陆，因此增加自己军队的数目。他的军队是按照美国训练的，使用的是美制的武器。蒋介石集团在金门集中了大量兵力，这是为了对人民中国进行挑衅。正是在这个区域，去年夏秋蒋帮及其主子进行了大规模的军事行动。
    文章强调说，美帝国主义集团闭着眼睛不看事物的实际情况，不想看到世界舞台上已经发生的变化，继续用旧的政策来对待中国。这种政策被外国报刊称之为荒唐的政策。
    文章说，全世界人民希望巩固的、持久的安全，他们热烈赞同苏联为缓和国际紧张局势而采取的政策。但是，许多事实证明，美国的一些代表人物不愿国际关系正常化，他们力求保持“冷战”。当苏联提出取消外国军事基地的时候，他们感到厌恶。美国副总统尼克松访苏时也对苏联报刊提出的取消外国军事基地的问题避而不答。但这并不是无所谓的问题，而是关系到千百万人的问题。因为外国军事基地是对和平的实际威胁。美军占领中国岛屿，进行军事准备，对中华人民共和国进行一贯的武装挑衅——这些都威胁到人民中国和远东以及东南亚其他国家的安全。
    中国有句俗话说，“卧榻之旁岂容他人酣睡”。当中国的自古的领土台湾还被蒋帮盘据着的时候，中国人民是不能感到平安的。美国的侵略政策就是台湾这颗“定时炸弹”的引火物。扑灭引火物和这颗炸弹是千百万人民的意志。
