Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 17th: The No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) began baking on the afternoon of September 17th. Soon, WISCO will embark on a new milestone of both iron and steel production, contributing its strength to the nation's goal of seizing 12 million tons of steel.

On the 17th, large coal gas pipelines stretched windingly from the iron-making plant to the side of the open hearth furnace. Air compression, water supply and drainage, and ventilation pipelines were also connected to the furnace body. Steelworkers quickly rushed to the area surrounding the open hearth furnace body, tensely carrying out preparations before baking. After several hours of combat, the steelworkers twisted the gas pipeline valve in front of the south second door of the open hearth furnace. Instantly, the gas flame filled the hearth, and cheers and enthusiastic applause celebrating the early ignition of the baking furnace resounded in front of the furnace.

    武钢一号平炉烘炉
    新华社武汉17日电　武钢一号平炉17日下午开始烘炉。不久，武钢就要跨上既炼铁又出钢的新的里程，为祖国夺取一千二百万吨钢而贡献力量。
    17日，粗大的煤气管道从炼铁厂蜿蜒伸展到平炉炉旁，空气压缩、上下水和通风等管道，也都通向了平炉本体。炼钢工人迅速地赶到平炉本体周围，紧张地进行着烘炉前的准备工作。经过几个小时的战斗，炼钢工人们扭动平炉南二门前的煤气管道阀闸，顿时，瓦斯火光充满炉膛，炉前响起了庆贺提前点火烘炉的欢呼声和热烈的掌声。
