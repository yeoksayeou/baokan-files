Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Vice Premier Bo Yibo, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, addressed steelworkers nationwide today at the National Steelworker Competition and Appraisal Radio Conference.

In his speech, he first extended his warmest greetings to the millions of steelworkers and hundreds of advanced units on the steel front, who are holding high the banner of safeguarding the Party's General Line, and congratulated them on their great victories!

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said: "In March of this year, we held a 'National Steelworker High-Yield, High-Quality Competition Radio Conference' here. Only half a year has passed, and the steel front has already achieved outstanding results. In the vigorous mass movement, on all fronts of the steel industry, whether in mass campaigns using modern methods or those using indigenous methods, whether in the production of mining, beneficiation, coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, or refractory materials, or in auxiliary work such as machine repair and transportation, a large number of advanced units and advanced producers have emerged. They have not only achieved excellent results in high output, high quality, and low cost, but also created extremely rich advanced experiences, fully demonstrating the soaring enthusiasm and unparalleled wisdom of the steelworkers."

Bo Yibo said: "The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly inspired you, and everyone has enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to oppose Right deviation, boost morale, and vigorously increase production and practice economy. In August, you repeatedly broke the highest daily steel production records of the previous months, increasing steel production in August by 10% compared to July. Since September, reports of success in steel production have been frequent and thriving. The average daily output level in the first fifteen days has increased by 18% compared to August, and on the basis of August, records have been continuously refreshed, advancing towards higher combat goals. We must seize this favorable situation, go all out, strive for the best, and struggle to complete 12 million tons of steel ahead of schedule and above the target this year!"

Bo Yibo emphasized that completing 12 million tons of steel ahead of schedule and above the target this year, and correspondingly increasing and overfulfilling the plans for pig iron and steel products, means that we will complete the steel targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, maintaining the highest speed of increasing by more than 50% (modern steel) compared to last year. That is to say, contrary to the hopes of domestic and foreign enemies and right-leaning opportunists, our steel industry will continue to advance at a great-leap-forward pace along the path of last year's Great Leap Forward, towards the great goal of socialist industrialization.

Bo Yibo then put forward the following three requirements on how to achieve this task victoriously:

One, we must further respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, oppose Right deviation, boost morale, and deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, focusing on high output, high quality, and low cost. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party called for opposing Right deviation and boosting morale, steel production has advanced by leaps and bounds. This vividly illustrates that as long as we vigorously engage in mass movements and adhere to putting politics in command, our production will innovate daily, and it will be possible to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and above the target this year. By doing this concretely, we are safeguarding the Party's General Line.

Two, vigorously learn, promote, and continue to create various advanced experiences, further launching a new upsurge of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced." Since the large-scale steel campaign, we have solved two fundamental problems in industrial construction. One is to build steel by the mass line method (that is, vigorously engaging in mass movements), breaking the previous situation of a few people building steel in a cold and quiet manner. The other is, in the process of implementing the Party's policy of combining large-scale enterprises with small and medium-sized enterprises, combining modern production methods with indigenous production methods, and combining central industry with local industry, we have gained experience in walking on two legs in all aspects of the steel front. These two things are the inexhaustible source of our high-speed development of the steel industry. As long as we earnestly promote various advanced experiences and continuously create new advanced experiences, further carry out a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy and a socialist labor competition, we can enable every enterprise to achieve "high output, high quality, and low cost."

Three, conscientiously do a good job in coordination and seize various key measures. Now we are about to enter the fourth quarter, which is a quarter of decisive significance for completing this year's tasks and preparing for a continued Great Leap Forward next year. While grasping political ideology, engaging in mass movements, and learning from advanced experiences, we must continue to implement the communist ideology of the whole country as one chessboard, achieving mutual support, such as timely transfer of ore and pig iron; within the enterprise, we must focus on weak links, seize the key issues that are decisive for increasing production and practicing economy this year, and take effective and concrete measures to mobilize all employees to strive to achieve them. There are only a hundred days left this year. Opportunity knocks but once, we must guard against arrogance and impatience, be unremitting, and do everything possible to strive to achieve the goals of increasing production and practicing economy!

### 薄一波副总理号召全国钢铁职工乘胜前进  力保钢铁生产以最高速度前进

    薄一波副总理号召全国钢铁职工乘胜前进
    力保钢铁生产以最高速度前进
    三点要求：
    一、进一步反右倾，鼓干劲，深入开展以高产、优质、低成本为内容的增产节约运动；
    二、大力学习、推广、创造先进经验，进一步掀起“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的新高潮；
    三、认真搞好协作，抓紧各项关键措施。
    新华社22日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波今天在全国钢铁职工竞赛评比广播大会上，对全国钢铁战线的职工讲了话。
    他在讲话中首先向高举着保卫党的总路线的大旗的钢铁战线上的几百万大军以及数以百计的先进单位，致以最亲切的慰问，祝贺他们取得了伟大的胜利！
    薄一波副总理说：今年3月，我们在这里举行过一次“全国钢铁职工高产优质竞赛广播大会”。现在时间过去才有半年，而钢铁战线上已经取得了十分突出的成就。在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，钢铁工业的各个战线上，无论是在大洋群方面或小洋群方面，无论是在采矿、选矿、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢、耐火材料的生产方面，或者在机修、运输等辅助工作方面，都涌现出了大批的先进单位、先进生产者。他们不仅取得了高产、优质、低成本的优异成绩，而且创造了极为丰富的先进经验，充分体现了钢铁职工的冲天干劲和无比智慧。
    薄一波说：党的八届八中全会更大大地鼓舞了你们，大家都热烈地响应了党的反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约的号召。8月份，你们一再打破了前几个月的钢铁最高日产纪录，使8月份的钢的生产比7月份提高了10％。9月以来，钢铁生产更是捷报频传，蒸蒸日上。前十五天的平均日产水平比8月份又提高了18％，而且在8月份的基础上，又不断地刷新了纪录，向着更高的战斗目标突进。我们必须抓住这个有利形势，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为在今年提前、超额完成一千二百万吨钢而斗争！
    薄一波强调指出，今年提前、超额完成一千二百万吨钢以及相应地提高、超额完成生铁和钢材计划，就意味着我们将提前三年完成第二个五年计划的钢铁指标，保持了比去年增加50％以上（洋钢）的最高速度。也就是说，同国内外敌人及右倾机会主义分子的希望相反，我们的钢铁工业，将沿着去年大跃进的道路，继续以大跃进的步伐，向着社会主义工业化的伟大目标高速前进。
    薄一波接着对如何胜利实现这一任务，提出了以下三点要求：
    一、要更进一步地响应党中央的号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，深入开展以高产、优质、低成本为内容的增产节约运动。自从党的八届八中全会号召反右倾、鼓干劲以来，钢铁生产突飞猛进。这就生动地说明了只要我们大搞群众运动，坚持政治挂帅，就会使我们的生产日日革新，就可能使今年的国家计划提前超额完成。我们这样具体地做了，就是保卫了党的总路线。
    二、大力学习、推广并且继续创造各种先进经验，进一步掀起“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的新高潮。大办钢铁以来，我们解决了工业建设中的两个根本问题。一个是以群众路线的方法（即大搞群众运动）来办钢铁，打破了以前少数人冷冷清清办钢铁的局面。一个是在执行党的大型企业和中小型企业并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举、中央工业和地方工业并举的方针的过程中，在钢铁战线的各个方面，取得了两条腿走路的经验。这两件东西，是我们高速度发展钢铁工业的无穷无尽的源泉。只要我们认真地推行各种先进经验并且不断创造新的先进经验，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动和社会主义劳动竞赛，我们就能使每一个企业达到“高产、优质、低成本”。
    三、认真搞好协作，抓紧各项关键措施。现在即将进入第四季度，这是完成今年任务并且作好明年继续大跃进的准备的具有决定意义的一个季度。我们必须在抓政治思想、搞群众运动、学先进经验的同时，继续贯彻执行全国一盘棋的共产主义协作思想，做到互相支援，比如及时调运矿石、生铁等；在企业内部，要针对薄弱环节，抓紧对今年增产节约有决定性的关键问题，采取有效的具体措施，发动全体职工努力实现。今年剩下不过一百天了。机不可失，时不再来，我们一定要戒骄戒躁，毋懈毋怠，千方百计，为实现增产节约目标而努力奋斗！
