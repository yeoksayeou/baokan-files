    Awakening the Sleeping Earth

    The vast and fertile land of our motherland is like a giant palm, holding countless secrets and hiding countless priceless treasures. On this great slope, plunging from the western plateau straight to the Pacific Ocean, the winding, tens-of-thousands-of-miles-long mountain ranges are like giant green dragons, guarding nature's boundless treasure trove. The long and ancient rivers, carrying thousands upon thousands of cubic meters of flow per second towards the sea, are like the lifeblood of the earth. Various soils are covered with carpets woven from tens of thousands of species of flowers and trees, a riot of color. Lakes of all sizes and newly emerged man-made reservoirs are embedded like crystals among them. For thousands of years, the working people have shed countless drops of sweat to utilize this land. However, because modern science in old China was as weak as a sick infant, many secrets of the motherland were not revealed, its vast treasures were not discovered, and it had long been sleeping.

    How much scientific research did old China conduct on this rich and diverse land?

    From the beginning of modern science in China until the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang breathed its last, the maximum number of employees engaged in geological work nationwide was only eight hundred, of whom only two hundred were scientific and technical personnel. Many advanced exploration technologies were not adopted. There were only forty or fifty botanical workers, including auxiliary personnel. There was not a single comprehensive survey team. Endless sandy soil swallowed up fertile land, and no one tried to stop it. Border and wilderness areas, accounting for more than 60% of the country's total land area, were almost scientifically blank. Although a few scientists and the broad masses of working people, relying on their own efforts, made indelible contributions in academia, in conquering nature, and in utilizing nature, the reactionary government single-mindedly exploited the people's wealth and treated science as a mere embellishment. The dilapidated national economy left science with no place to be useful. The scientific achievements of scientists and the working masses were only a drop in the ocean compared to the vast and rich motherland. Ten years ago at this moment, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party, broke free from their shackles! They stood up! They became the masters of the land, and only then did they have the energy and interest, and only then was it possible to launch a comprehensive offensive against the land. Now, our geological personnel have grown from more than eight hundred in old China to a geological army of 330,000 with modern equipment, of which the number of various scientific and technical personnel has increased from more than two hundred to more than forty thousand. Ten comprehensive survey teams and a large number of specialized survey and exploration teams have almost traversed every corner of the country in order to make the land "reveal the truth." On the perpetually snowy mountains, in the primeval forests haunted by tigers and leopards, in the deserts where people "go in but can't get out," and in places where birds cannot reach and not a single blade of grass grows, the footprints of new China's scientific and technical personnel and workers and peasants are now imprinted. The sleeping earth has been awakened!

    "Dissecting" the Earth's Crust to Find Treasures

    Ten years, in the history of the earth's crust, is only a fleeting moment. But in this short decade, scientists and the broad masses have already explored the secrets of the motherland's land over hundreds of millions of years of history.

    From the "Paleogeographic Map of China" compiled by geological and paleontological workers after liberation, it can be seen that our land in ancient times had a completely different appearance. The area around the present-day Himalayas was the eastern part of the ancient Mediterranean Sea about two hundred million years ago. The current areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, and southern Shaanxi were isolated islands three hundred million years ago. More than two hundred million years ago, almost the entire Chinese mainland was still ocean. On the paleogeographic map, one can only see some scattered islands. Seas turned into mulberry fields, and after several changes, it was not until the "Jurassic Period," 150 million years ago, that the land formed the way it looks now.

    In the ancient hundreds of millions of years, the earth slowly modified its appearance. Today, we must use our own hands to change the face of the earth and bring the treasures hidden underground and on the ground to meet the people! One of our tools is science.

    The formation of various mineral resources is controlled by the tectonics of the earth. The distribution of various mineral resources in the earth's crust follows certain rules, so geological science is a signpost on the road to the underground treasure house. In the increasingly broad field of geology, geological surveying is a basic work; it is the foundation of prospecting and the foundation of geological theory. A batch of achievements in geological surveying and geological research work in the past ten years are the national geological map, provincial geological maps, and geological maps of various sub-disciplines in geology compiled since the Great Leap Forward. An important achievement completed by geological workers in the Great Leap Forward last year after several years of hard work is the forthcoming "Tectonic Map of China" with a scale of 1:4,000,000. This tectonic map has 153 sheets, with more than 500,000 words of text description. It includes schematic diagrams of the development history of the Chinese crust in various periods, schematic diagrams of the paleotectonics and neotectonics of China, and a schematic diagram of the main metallogenic areas of Chinese mineral deposits, illustrating the distribution patterns of minerals in China. The compilation of the tectonic map can academically clarify the theory of crustal structure, point out the direction of prospecting in production, and can also be used as a reference for selecting dam foundations and roadbeds in civil engineering.

    Based on the compilation of geological maps, tectonic maps, and lithofacies maps, geological workers have compiled ore-forming prediction maps for several minerals such as petroleum, coal, phosphorus, iron, non-ferrous metals, and rare elements, which directly guide prospecting. For example, following the guidance of the phosphorus ore prediction map, phosphorus ore was discovered in Shanxi, Shandong, and Henan.

    This series of investigation and research results on the motherland's land has greatly exposed the paths leading to the underground treasures of the motherland before our eyes. The vast areas that people thought had no mineral deposits before liberation have now become new mining areas. The minerals that were thought to be scarce before liberation have now been proven to be not only not scarce but also very abundant. The reserves of many minerals have expanded dozens or even hundreds of times compared to the estimates before liberation... The Qilian Mountains in the Great Northwest of the motherland used to be a blank spot on the geological map. Although a few scientists were determined to open the treasure house of this mountain, they could only do some sporadic investigations at the foot of the mountain and sigh at the vast white peaks due to the reactionary government's indifference to science. Today, this neglected wilderness has become the darling of the Chinese people, becoming more and more famous and lively. Batch after batch of workers, cadres, and scientific and technical personnel gathered here from all directions. Exploration teams, drilling rigs, tents, scaffolding, factory buildings... are increasing day by day. A village with three and a half households in the mountainside in the past has now developed into a new industrial town. We have found here large copper mines that we always thought China was lacking, as well as many large-scale deposits of iron, lead, zinc, aluminum, coal, and other types. The discovery of the Jingtieshan large iron mine here provides a raw material production base for the future establishment of a steel joint enterprise in the Northwest. In the formerly desolate and barren Karamay and Qaidam, towering oil drilling rigs and derricks have become the most attractive scenery. Chromium, potassium, and many rare elements that did not exist in old China have now been found in many deposits. No molybdenum deposit had ever been found in old China's geological data, but now a deposit with reserves among the largest in the world has been found. Many large and medium-sized copper mines have been found in many provinces and regions that used to lack copper... In the basin salt lakes, many precious and rare elements and potassium and boron with great prospective reserves have been found. These discoveries will change the past concept that inland salt lakes do not contain potassium salts and provide a new direction for finding potassium salt deposits.

    On the mineral maps of old China, the sparse mineral points were like a few small boats in the vast sea. Now, the mineral points on the land of the motherland are densely packed, like a sky full of stars on a summer night. In the past, it was said that China lacked this and lacked that, but now it has been proven that every province and region has many valuable mineral deposits. Why worry about not having raw materials for developing industry all over the country!

    Marching into the Desert

    In our vast territory, the desert is like a tiger entrenched in the Great Northwest. Its total area is almost equal to the national cultivated land area, estimated to be more than 1.6 billion mu. How to prevent flying sand from harming farmland? How to turn the wilderness into an oasis? The question that people have never thought of or dared to think of for generations has now begun to be solved by the people of new China. In the past three years, the state has organized several exploration teams and survey teams to go deep into places where there are no people, or even no life, to reveal the mysterious veil of the desert. In 1957 and 1958 alone, scientific survey personnel traveled more than 10,000 kilometers in the desert. At the beginning of this year, the state organized a scientific sand control team of more than 800 people, which has traversed most of the deserts in the country in the first half of the year, traveling nearly 50,000 kilometers. After three years of investigation and research and summarizing the experience of the people in the sandy areas in fighting sand hazards for many years, scientific sand control workers have mastered some of the secrets of the desert, creating a prerequisite for conquering sand hazards and utilizing the desert. They have found that the desert not only contains abundant mineral resources such as oil, alkali, boron, potassium, chromite, and various precious rare elements, but also has natural conditions for developing agriculture and animal husbandry in many places. There are usable lake basins and sand hao ponds in the desert, which can be transformed into good pastures and farms. In some deserts, the sand between the dunes contains water, and the thickness of the sand layer is only ten to twenty centimeters. The sand has strong permeability and weak capillary action, so groundwater often accumulates under the sand layer, which are all favorable conditions for plant growth. More than 400 species of psammophytes survive in the desert, which can be used to green the desert. Many of them are medicinal plants and fiber plants with considerable economic value, such as rhubarb, ephedra, licorice, Apocynum venetum, and Haloxylon ammodendron. Haloxylon ammodendron is a "strongman" in the desert. This perennial shrub of the Chenopodiaceae family can germinate its seeds in two or three hours when it encounters suitable temperature and humidity. It can live for seventy or eighty years and is a fuel with strong firepower. The desert has flat terrain and abundant light and heat, with about 3,000 hours of sunshine per year. Even in the winter with the shortest days, there is an average of seven hours of sunshine per day (referring to sunny days), which is rare in the country. Once the desert is greened and the water shortage problem is solved, these natural conditions can be fully utilized. At that time, not only can the expansion of shifting sand be prevented, but also this large area of sandy wasteland can be transformed into a new production base for the motherland. We firmly believe that the beautiful scenery of "fragrant grass like lawns, forests all over the fields, herds of cattle and sheep, and cotton and grain full of warehouses" will definitely appear in the desolate world where no one has been seen in the past!

    Visiting the Plant Kingdom

    Our country is one of the countries with the richest variety of plants in the world, from creeping wildflowers to primeval forests that reach into the clouds, with tens of thousands of varieties. However, in the decades from the establishment of modern botanical science in China to the time of liberation, the Chinese people themselves had not studied many of the precious trees and flowers of the motherland. Although a few Chinese scientists conducted some investigations after 1926, they lacked organized leadership, and the work was sporadic. Botanical science work after liberation was carried out on such a weak foundation. The investigation and research of plant resources, as a science, started entirely from scratch. In the past ten years, we have achieved many research results on the laws of plant growth and distribution on the land of the motherland, on cultivating various plants needed by the people in a faster, better, and more economical way, and on how to use plants to improve soil, conserve water and soil, transform deserts, and change the climate... Our investigation and research on plants has almost covered all parts of the country, and we have discovered many new species and genera. We have found more than 1,500 species of wild plants with uses (excluding timber and medicinal plants). Especially in Yunnan, known as the "world's plant kingdom," botanical workers have reaped a great harvest in their investigations and research there. They investigated the tropical primeval forests of Yunnan and entered its hinterland for the first time. They found that in this natural garden of Yunnan, everywhere is fragrant. The number of azalea and primrose species and the brilliance of the flower colors are the most in the world. Some plants are herbaceous in northern China, but they grow into shrub-like perennial plants in Yunnan. Some plants are small shrubs in other regions, but they become large trees when they grow in Yunnan. Of particular significance is the discovery by botanical workers here of the rare Java lilac and Java bitter wood, and other tertiary (about sixty million to one million years ago) tree species. They believe that the reason why ancient remnant plants in Yunnan are particularly abundant is that they were not attacked by quaternary (about one million years ago to the present) glaciers and were preserved. These tree species in many other regions of the earth had long been eliminated during the quaternary glacial period.

    Based on a large number of field investigations and indoor research, the compilation of the "Flora of China," a collaboration of the entire botanical community in the country, began in the Great Leap Forward last year. This masterpiece is expected to have more than 20 million words, totaling 80 volumes. The first batch of seven volumes will be completed before National Day this year. Botanists had been talking about the Flora of China long before liberation, but under the rule of the reactionary government, they could only talk about it.

    In the botanical garden of the motherland's nature, we are increasingly extracting raw materials for production and means of livelihood! We are giving full play to the great role of versatile plants in transforming nature and benefiting mankind!

    "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's lair?"

    In the boiling years since the founding of new China, scientific personnel and workers and peasants in geology, biology, soil science, geophysics, geography, and even technical sciences, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and other fields have made valuable labor to uncover the mysteries of the motherland's land. In particular, scientific and technical personnel and the broad masses of working people who carried out field work have spent their hard, but also happy and poetic lives. The primeval forest of Yunnan was a mysterious and terrifying zone in the past. No one had ever entered the hinterland of this forest to investigate. In 1957, the Tropical Biological Survey Team came here. They used horses to carry tents, canned food, dried vegetables, flour, and rice, and were guided by local hunters familiar with the trails, moving forward on the footprints and urine and feces of tigers and leopards, and safely passed through the hinterland of the forest. Desert life is a different kind of taste. Many years ago, the Swede Sven Hedin led a team in an attempt to cross the northwest corner of the Taklamakan Desert, but failed. Some team members and most of the camels died of thirst in the desert. In 1957 and 1958, our oil exploration team safely crossed this desert, which is equivalent to the area of two United Kingdoms. Although life in the deep mountains and forests and deserts is difficult, the magnificent socialist cause has given them unlimited courage to overcome difficulties. Many members of the sand control team, which completed most of the desert route survey this year, were riding camels for the first time. They could not sit steadily while swaying on the camel's back, but they were still spirited and sang loudly to the accompaniment of camel bells. The pioneers of conquering the desert are traveling on the journey of conquering the desert in such a difficult but happy way.

    We find it difficult to forget the outstanding help provided by scientists and experts sent by the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries to our country's scientific undertakings. They not only buried themselves in hard work in our laboratories, but also trekked with our scientific teams in the deep mountains and wilderness of China, tasting the hardships of the field.

    To wage war on the earth and uncover the secrets of the land requires the organization of huge manpower and material resources, but it may not necessarily obtain immediate benefits. This is a grand plan to benefit future generations. How could semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China shoulder this important task! This is also not something that the reactionary ruling class is happy to do. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, have begun the great undertaking of conquering the land. In the past ten years, scientific and technical personnel and the broad masses of people, under the leadership of the Party, have mastered many secrets of the earth, discovered and exploited a large number of rich resources. In the future, with the further development of socialist construction, continuing to shine under the Party's general line, there will surely be new and greater achievements!

    揭开祖国大地的秘密
    新华社记者　吕新初
    惊醒了沉睡的大地
    广袤丰饶的祖国大地像一只巨掌，它掌握着千种万样的奥秘；它隐藏着无数无价的珍宝，在这从西部高原直泻太平洋的大斜面上，迤逦万里的山脉犹如一条条巨型的青龙，厮守着大自然的无穷宝库；源远流长的江河挟着每秒成千上万公方的流量奔向大海，好像是大地的血脉；各色各样的土壤上面铺着数万种花卉林木织成的姹紫嫣红的地毯；大大小小的湖泊和新出现的人造水库像水晶一般镶嵌其间。千百年来，劳动人民为利用这块大地流下了数不尽的汗滴。可是，由于近代科学在旧中国孱弱得像一个病中的婴儿，祖国大地的许多秘密没有被揭示；它的大量宝藏没有被发现，它长久以来沉睡着。
    旧中国对这丰富多采的大地作了多少科学研究呢？
    打从中国建立近代科学开始，直到国民党反动统治寿终正寝，全国从事地质工作的职工最多的时候只不过八百人，其中科学技术人员仅二百多人；许多先进勘探技术没有采用；植物学工作者包括辅助人员在内只有四、五十；综合考察队一个也没有；无垠沙壤吞噬着良田，无人去制止，……占全国土地总面积60％以上的边荒地区在科学上几乎是空白。虽然有少数科学家和广大劳动人民依靠他们自己的努力，在学术上、在征服自然和利用自然上作出了不可磨灭的贡献，但是反动政府一意剥削民脂民膏而把科学当作点缀品，雕敝的国民经济使科学无用武之地，科学家和劳动群众的科学成就对于辽阔富饶的祖国大地说来只不过是沧海之一粟。十年前的此刻，中国人民在党的领导下挣脱了枷锁，他们站起来了！他们作了大地的主人，他们才有精力和兴趣、也才有可能向大地展开全面的攻势。现在我国地质人员已由旧中国的八百多个发展成一支具有现代化装备的三十三万人的地质大军，其中各类科学技术人员从二百多发展到四万以上。植物学工作者从四、五十人壮大到数千。十个综合考察队和大批专业考察队、勘探队，为了要大地“吐露真情”，几乎踏遍了全国各个角落；在终年冰雪的高山上、在虎豹出没的原始森林中，在“进去了出不来”的大沙漠里，在那飞鸟不至寸草不生的地方，如今都印上了新中国科学技术人员和工农群众的足迹。沉睡的大地被惊醒了！
    “解剖”地壳找宝藏
    寒暑十易，在地壳的历史中只不过是昙花一现。可是就在这短促的十年中，科学工作者和广大群众已经探索了祖国大地亿万年历史中的奥秘。
    从地质古生物学工作者在解放后编制的“中国古地理图”上可以看到，我国大地在远古时代迥然是另一副面貌：现今的喜马拉雅山一带，在大约两亿年前是古地中海的东部；现今的四川、贵州、陕西南部等地方，在三亿年前是孤岛；二亿数千万年以前，现在的中国大陆几乎全部还是海洋，在古地理图上只能看到一些斑斑点点的岛屿。沧海桑田，经过几番变迁，直到一亿五千万年前的“侏罗纪”，才形成我们现在这模样的大地。
    古远的亿万年中，大地缓慢地修改着自己的面貌。今天，我们要用自己的双手来改变大地的面貌，让珍藏在地下地上的宝藏和人民见面！我们的工具之一就是科学。
    各种矿产资源的生成都受着大地构造的控制；各种矿产资源在地壳中的分布都遵循着一定的规律，所以，地质科学乃是通往地下宝库的道路上的指路碑。在愈来愈广的地质学领域里，地质测量是一项基本的工作，它是找矿的基础和地质理论的基础。十年来地质测量工作和地质研究工作的一批成果是大跃进以来编成的全国地质图、各省地质图，以及地质学中各分科的地质图。地质工作者经过数年奋战在去年大跃进中完成的一个重要的成果，是即将出版的四百万分之一比例尺“中国大地构造图”。这部大地构造图有一百五十三幅，文字说明五十多万字；包括各时期中国地壳发展历史示意图、中国大地古构造和新构造示意图，以及说明中国矿产分布规律的中国主要矿床成矿区示意图。大地构造图的编制，在学术上可以阐明地壳构造的理论，在生产上可指出找矿方向，也可作为土木工程中选择坝基和路基的参考。
    在编制地质图、大地构造图、岩相图的基础上，地质工作者编出了石油、煤、磷、铁、有色金属和稀有元素等若干种矿物的成矿预测图，它们对找矿起着直接的指导作用。例如根据磷矿预测图的指导，在山西、山东、河南都发现了磷矿。
    这一系列的关于祖国大地的调查研究成果，使得通往祖国地下宝藏的门径大量地暴露在我们眼前，解放前人们认为没有矿藏的广大地区现在成了新的矿区；解放前认为贫乏的矿产现在探明不但不贫乏而且很丰富，有许多矿产的储量比解放前估算的数字扩大了数十倍以至数百倍……。祖国大西北的祁连山，从前一直是地质上的空白点，虽然少数科学家有志于打开这个大山的宝库，但由于反动政府对科学的淡漠无情，他们只能在山脚下作些零星的调查，望着白茫茫的山峰兴叹而已。如今，这个一向被冷落的荒山却成了中国人民的宠儿，越来越著名、越来越热闹起来了。一批批的工人、干部、科学技术人员从四面八方汇集到这里；山上山下，勘探队、钻探机、帐篷、脚手架、厂房……一天比一天多起来。过去山腰里一个三户半居民的村子，现在已发展成一个新兴工业城镇了。我们在这里找到了一直认为中国贫乏的大型铜矿，以及铁、铅、锌、铝、煤等许多种大型矿床。这里的镜铁山大铁矿的发现，为将来建立西北的钢铁联合企业提供了原料产地。在从前荒凉贫瘠的克拉玛依、柴达木，今天高耸的石油钻机和井架成了最吸引人的景色。旧中国没有的铬、钾和许多稀有元素，现在都找到了不少矿床，旧中国地质资料上没有发现过一个钼矿产地，现在发现储量居世界之最，在许多过去缺铜的省区找到了不少大中型铜矿……。在盆地盐湖中，找到了许多珍贵稀有的元素和远景储量很大的钾和硼，这些发现将改变过去认为内陆盐湖不含钾盐的概念，并为寻找钾盐矿床提出了新方向。
    旧中国的矿产图上，稀稀落落的矿点好像茫茫大海中的几叶扁舟。现在祖国大地上的矿点密密麻麻，犹如夏夜繁星满天。过去说中国缺这缺那，现在证明每个省区都有许多有价值的矿藏，全国遍地发展工业何患没有原料！
    向沙漠进军
    在我国辽阔的疆土上，沙漠像一头老虎一样盘踞在大西北。它的总面积几乎与全国耕地面积相等，估计有十六亿亩以上。如何使飞扬的风沙不危害农田？如何使漠野成为绿洲？这个世世代代以来人们所不曾想或不敢想的问题，今天已经开始由新中国人民来着手解决了。近三年中，国家组织了好几个勘探队和考察队，深入到没有人烟，甚至没有生命存在的地方去揭示沙漠的神秘面纱。1957和1958两年，科学考察人员在沙漠中走过的路线全长一万多公里。今年初，国家组织了一支八百多人组成的治沙科学队伍，在上半年中已经穿行了全国极大部分的沙漠，经过的路程近五万公里。经过三年来的考察研究和总结了沙区人民多年来向沙害斗争的经验，治沙科学工作者已经掌握了沙漠的一些秘密，为征服沙害、利用沙漠创造了前提。他们发现：沙漠中不但蕴藏着丰富的矿产如石油、碱、硼、钾、铬铁矿和多种珍贵的稀有元素，而且在很多地方也具有发展农牧业的自然条件。沙漠中有可以利用的湖泊盆地和沙蒿塘，它们经过改造以后都可以成为很好的牧场和农场；有些沙漠中，沙丘之间的沙子带着水份，沙层的厚度不过十到二十厘米，沙地透水性强，毛细管作用弱，因此在沙层下面常常积有地下水，这些都是植物生长的有利条件。在沙漠中生存着四百种以上的沙生植物，都可以用来绿化沙漠，其中有许多是经济价值相当高的药用植物和纤维植物，如大黄、麻黄、甘草、罗布麻，梭梭等。梭梭是沙漠中的“大力士”，这种多年生的藜科灌木，遇着适当温度和湿度，它的种子可在二、三个小时内发芽；它可以活上七八十年，是一种火力很强的燃料。沙漠地势平坦，光热丰富，每年约有三千小时的光照，即使在白昼最短的冬季，平均每天也有七小时的日照（指晴天），这种情况在全国是少有的。一旦沙漠绿化，缺水的问题解决后，这些自然条件就可充分地利用起来，那时不但可以制止流沙扩展，而且可以把这一大片沙荒改造成为祖国新的生产基地，我们坚信：“芳草如茵、林木遍野，牛羊成群，棉粮满仓”的美景一定会出现在过去不见人烟的荒凉世界！
    造访植物王国
    我国是世界上植物种类最丰富的国家之一，从匍匐地面的野草闲花到高插云霄的原始森林，品种有好几万。但是中国自从建立近代植物科学到解放时的数十年中，中国人自己对于祖国的许多珍贵的树木花草却没有研究过。1926年以后虽有少数中国科学工作者作了些调查，但缺乏组织领导，工作是零星的，解放后的植物科学工作，就是在这样薄弱的基础上开展起来。而植物资源的调查研究，作为一门科学，则完全是白手起家。十年中，我们对于植物在祖国大地上生长和分布的规律以及多快好省地栽培人们所需要的各种植物，对于怎样利用植物来改良土壤、保持水土、改造沙漠、改变气候……，已经取得了不少研究成果。我们对植物的调查研究几乎遍及全国各地，发现了许多新种新属；找到有用途的野生植物（不包括材用和药用植物）在一千五百种以上。尤其在被称为“世界植物王国”的云南，植物学工作者在那里的调查研究获得了丰收：他们考察了云南热带原始森林，第一次深入了它的腹地。他们发现在云南这个天然大花园里，到处芬芳，杜鹃和报春花种类之多，花色之艳，为世界之最；有的植物在中国北部是草本，在云南就长成了灌木状的多年生植物，有的植物在其他地区是小灌木，生长在云南就成了大树。特别有意义的是植物学工作者在这里发现了世界上少有的爪哇紫树、爪哇苦木等第三纪（距今约六千万年到一百万年）的树种。他们认为云南古老残余植物之所以特别丰富，是由于没有遭到第四纪（距今约一百万年到现在）冰川的侵袭而保留下来，地球上其他许多地区的这些树种则早已在第四纪冰川时期被消灭了。
    在大量的野外调查和室内研究的基础上，全国植物学界合作的“中国植物志”的编写工作已在去年大跃进中开端。这部巨著预计有二千万字以上，计八十卷。今年国庆前夕可完成第一批七册。植物学家在解放前早就谈论过中国植物志，但在反动政府统治下，就只能谈谈而已。
    在祖国大自然的植物园里，我们正在越来越多地索取生产原料和生活资料！我们正在发挥着多能的植物对于改造自然造福人类的巨大作用！
    “不入虎穴，焉得虎子”
    在新中国成立以来的沸腾的岁月里，地质、生物、土壤、地球物理、地理，以至技术科学、化学、物理、数学等各方面的科学人员和工农群众为揭开祖国大地的奥秘付出了珍贵的劳动，特别是进行野外工作的科学技术人员和广大劳动群众度过了他们艰辛的，也是愉快和充满了诗意的生活。云南原始森林，在过去是一个神秘恐怖的地带，从没有人进入这个森林的腹地去考察过。1957年，热带生物考察队来到了这里，他们用马匹驮着帐篷、罐头食品、干菜、面粉和大米，由当地熟悉路径的猎人作向导，踏着虎豹的足迹和虎豹的尿粪前进，安全地穿过了森林腹地。沙漠生活又别是一番滋味。很多年以前，瑞典人斯文·哈定率领了一支队伍企图穿越塔克拉玛干大沙漠的西北角也没成功，一部分队员和大部分骆驼渴死在沙漠里。1957年和1958年，我们的石油勘探队安全穿过了这块面积相当两个英国的大沙漠。深山丛林和沙漠中的生活尽管艰苦，但是壮丽的社会主义事业赋予了他们克服困难的无限勇气。今年完成了大部分沙漠路线考察的治沙队，许多队员都是初次骑骆驼。在驼背上摇摇晃晃坐也坐不稳，但他们还是精神奋发，在驼铃的伴奏下，引吭高歌。征服沙漠的尖兵就是这样艰辛而又愉快地旅行在沙漠的征途中。
    我们难于忘记苏联和其他兄弟国家派出的科学家专家对我国科学事业的成效卓著的帮助。他（她）们不但在我们的实验室中埋头苦干，而且和我们的科学队伍一起，跋涉于中国的深山荒野，尝遍了野外的艰辛。
    向地球开战，揭开大地的秘密，需要组织庞大的人力物力，然而却不一定可以获得眼前的利益，这是造福子孙万代的大计，半殖民地半封建的旧中国哪能担负起这个重任！这也不是反动统治阶级所乐于作的事。中国人民在共产党的英明领导下，凭借社会主义制度的无比优越条件，开始了征服大地的壮举。过去的十年中，科学技术人员和广大群众在党的领导下已经掌握了大地的不少秘密，发现和开采了大量的富源，今后随着社会主义建设的进一步发展，继续在党的总路线光辉照耀下，必将会有新的更大的成就！
