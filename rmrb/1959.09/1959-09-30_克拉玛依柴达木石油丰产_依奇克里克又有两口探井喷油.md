Karamay and Qaidam Achieve High Oil Production
Two More Exploration Wells in Yiqiklik Spout Oil
    This newspaper's Urumqi dispatch on the 29th: Since the Karamay mining area in Xinjiang deeply implemented the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, crude oil production has been rising daily, exceeding quotas every ten days. By the 19th, it had completed the crude oil production plan for the third quarter eleven days ahead of schedule.
    In order to thoroughly overcome the right-leaning sentiments of a few cadres, the Karamay Mining Area Party Committee held an enlarged meeting in early September. On the one hand, it deeply inspected and criticized the right-leaning thoughts among cadres from top to bottom. On the other hand, it used the experience of launching mass movements to organize the masses to hold large-scale meetings, conduct challenge matches, post big-character posters, speak out freely, and carry out large-scale competitions and evaluations. At the same time, it conducted in-depth publicity and education on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session. All units made guarantees, formulated measures, launched challenges and responses, and set off a vigorous mass movement. At the same time, leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines, eating, living, and working with the workers, breaking through weak links, and solving specific problems in a timely manner. In the first half of September, by strengthening the management of old wells, more than 700 tons of crude oil were produced. The average daily crude oil production in the entire region in the first half of September increased sharply by 24.5% compared with the same period in August.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 29th: Oil workers in the Qaidam Basin excellently completed the state's crude oil production plan for September five days ahead of schedule. The crude oil produced in these twenty-five days was 8% more than the total output of the entire year last year, and about 30% more than in August.
    In order to resolutely implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers were highly motivated. In September, whether it was the utilization rate of oil wells or the effectiveness of the technology employed, it generally increased by 15% to 20% compared to the past. The daily crude oil production has been stable between 1,000 and 1,500 tons.

    This newspaper reports: Recently, two exploration wells in the Yiqiklik oilfield in southern Xinjiang have spouted crude oil. So far, five exploration wells in this new exploration area have spouted crude oil.
    The Yiqiklik oilfield is located in the Kuqa Basin at the southern foot of the Tianshan Mountains. In September of last year, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration started drilling the first exploration well here. This well spouted a large amount of crude oil in October of last year. This year, the Tarim Geological Exploration Department has successively started drilling four more exploration wells in the Yiqiklik oilfield, and these four exploration wells have successively spouted crude oil.
    Currently, the Tarim Geological Exploration Department is engaged in self-extraction and self-refining here. The gasoline and diesel they need can now be self-sufficient.

    克拉玛依柴达木石油丰产
    依奇克里克又有两口探井喷油
    本报乌鲁木齐29日电　新疆克拉玛依矿区自深入贯彻党的八届八中全会决议以来，原油产量日日上升，旬旬超额，到19日便提前十一天完成了第三季度的原油生产计划。
    克拉玛依矿区党委为了彻底克服少数干部的右倾情绪，9月初召开了扩大会议，一面自上而下地深入检查批判干部中的右倾思想，一面运用大搞群众运动的经验，组织群众开大会打擂比武，出大字报，大鸣大放，开展大竞赛、大评比，同时深入进行了八中全会精神的宣传教育。各单位人人提保证，订措施，展开挑战应战，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。与此同时，各级领导干部深入现场，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动，突破薄弱环节，及时解决具体问题。9月上半月由于加强旧井管理，就增产原油七百多吨。全区9月上半月的原油平均日产量，比8月同期猛增24.5％。
    据新华社西宁29日电　柴达木盆地的石油职工提前五天出色地完成了9月份的国家原油生产计划。这二十五天生产的原油，比去年全年的产量还多8％，比8月份增加约30％。
    为了坚决贯彻党的八届八中全会精神，职工们干劲冲天。9月份，不论油井利用率或采用时效，一般都比过去提高15％到20％。每天的原油产量都稳定在一千吨到一千五百吨之间。
    本报讯　新疆南部依奇克里克油田最近有两口探井喷出原油。至此，这个新探区已有五口探井喷出原油。
    依奇克里克油田位于天山南麓库车盆地。去年9月间，新疆石油管理局在这里开钻第一口探井。这口井在去年10月间就喷出大量原油。今年塔里木地质勘探处又在依奇克里克油田陆续开钻了四口探井，这四口探井都陆续喷出了原油。
    目前，塔里木地质勘探处已在这里自采自炼。他们需用的汽油和柴油已能自给。
