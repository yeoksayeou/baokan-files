This dispatch from Tianjin on September 1st reports: Qinglong County, Hebei Province, in its production and construction during the first half of this year, has fully utilized the superiority of the unified leadership and comprehensive planning of the People's Communes, changing the original barren and backward mountain production landscape.

In the first half of this year, various productions such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sericulture, fruit trees, and sideline occupations in Qinglong County achieved good results on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year. The winter wheat that was experimentally planted achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of about 220 catties per mu. The 840,000 mu of autumn crops in the county are currently lush and green, with the seedlings growing much better than in previous years. Other productions have also developed rapidly. In the first half of the year, the People's Communes vigorously planted trees and afforested, planting trees on 94% of the county's suitable afforestation areas, increasing the county's forest area by 5.8% on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year. The various fruit trees planted and grafted by the People's Communes in the first half of the year exceeded the total number of fruit trees planted and grafted before the communization. After the concentrated planting in the first half of this year, the number of mulberry trees in the county also increased by 1.6 times on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year. The spring silkworms raised this year increased by 7% compared to last year. The development of animal husbandry has also been rapid. In half a year, large livestock increased by 13%, sheep increased by 24%, pigs increased by 23%, and chickens increased by 77%. Five communes with an average of three pigs per household and one hundred and twelve production teams with an average of three pigs per household emerged in the county. The income from other sideline productions increased by 12% compared to the same period last year.

The comprehensive development of diverse economies has rapidly changed the past impoverished face of mountain areas relying solely on agriculture, greatly increasing the commodity volume of the communes and increasing the income of commune members. Currently, each People's Commune in the county has an average of more than 60 mu of forest land, 32 fruit trees, 315 mulberry trees, nearly one large animal, three sheep, 2.7 pigs, and five chickens per household, in addition to agricultural production. In the first half of this year alone, the fourteen communes in the county sold 4.09 million yuan worth of commodities to the outside world. The income from sideline occupations, animal husbandry, and fruit trees in the first half of the year averaged 25 yuan per person based on the county's population, accounting for half of the net income of farmers in 1957 before communization.

Before the People's Communes, the Qinglong County faced many contradictions in carrying out mountain production and construction due to the small scale of the original agricultural production cooperatives and their limited manpower and financial resources, such as agriculture and forestry competing for labor and sloping land, agriculture and animal husbandry competing for grain, and animal husbandry and sericulture competing for mountain areas. Many agricultural cooperatives could not engage in diverse operations because of insufficient labor after tending the fields. Furthermore, due to the small scale of the agricultural cooperatives, they did not have the strength to develop deep mountain areas, and contradictions such as disputes over mountains and grasslands often occurred between cooperatives and teams. This year, under the unified leadership of the Qinglong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Communes of Qinglong County first formulated comprehensive development plans based on local conditions, comprehensively developed and utilized mountains, rivers, and land, and implemented the mutual cooperation and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. First, the existing cultivated land area was fixed, and efforts were made to convert sloping land into terraced fields, gradually promoting the garden-like cultivation of terraced fields, reclaiming river beaches, and building paddy fields, striving to increase agricultural output. At the same time, steep slopes were abandoned for farming and converted back to forests for planting fruit trees. Forest land and pastures were appropriately delineated according to soil erosion and water and grass conditions, resolving the contradiction between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry competing for slopes and land. While uniformly planning agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fruit land, the People's Communes also rationally allocated labor used by each industry according to the principle of proportional development. In addition to extracting 70% of the labor force for agricultural production, the communes also extracted 11% of the labor force for forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. According to the labor allocation ratio, the communes and teams formed 1,097 specialized teams, responsible for specialized tasks, fixed division of labor, and mutual support. This overcame the contradiction of agricultural cooperatives being unable to attend to everything and achieved overall planning and comprehensive development. The communes and teams also appropriately allocated funds for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry according to local conditions. The communes and teams divided mountain construction into three leading fronts: agriculture, forestry and fruit, and livestock, and strengthened leadership by the Party Committee Secretary of the commune, etc.

Now, male and female commune members throughout the county are strengthening the late-stage management of autumn fields, striving for a bumper autumn harvest and further development of diverse economies.

    统筹兼顾解决矛盾　农林牧副齐头发展
    青龙山区贫困面貌大改观
    果木桑树满山坡　牛羊猪鸡遍地转
    本报天津1日电　河北省青龙县在今年上半年的生产建设当中，充分发挥了人民公社统一领导、全面规划的优越性，改变了原来贫瘠落后的山区生产面貌。
    今年上半年青龙县农、林、畜牧、桑蚕、果树、副业等各项生产，都在去年大跃进的基础上，取得了良好的成绩。试种的冬小麦，获得了空前的丰收，平均亩产二百二十斤左右。全县八十四万亩秋庄稼，目前一片黑绿，苗景大大超过往年。其它各项生产，发展得也很快。上半年各人民公社大力植树造林，将全县94％的宜林面积，都栽上了树木，使全县的林地面积在去年大跃进的基础上，又增长了5.8％。上半年各人民公社栽种嫁接的各种果树，超过了公社化前有史以来栽种嫁接果树的总和。经过今年上半年的突击栽种，全县的桑树也在去年大跃进的基础上，增加了一点六倍。今年放养的春蚕，比去年增加了7％。畜牧业的发展也很快，半年当中大家畜增长了13％，羊增长了24％，猪增长了23％，鸡增长了77％；全县并出现了五个平均每户三口猪的公社，和一百一十二个平均每户三口猪的生产队。其它副业生产的收入比去年同期增多了12％。
    多种经济的全面发展，迅速改变了过去山区单纯经营农业的贫困面貌，大大增加了各公社的商品量，增加了社员的收入。目前这个县各人民公社除农业生产外，平均每户有六十多亩林地，三十二棵果树，三百一十五棵桑，将近一头大家畜、三只羊、二点七头猪、五只鸡。仅今年上半年，全县十四个公社，即向外出售了四百零九万元的商品。上半年的副业、牧业和果树收入，按全县人口平均每人可收入二十五元，占公社化前的1957年农民纯收入的一半。
    青龙县在人民公社化前，由于原来的农业生产合作社组织规模小，人力财力有限，在进行山区生产建设时，存在着农业和林业争劳力争坡地，农业和畜牧业争粮食，畜牧和林桑争山场等许多矛盾。许多农业社因为劳力不足，顾上种地就顾不了开展多种经营。并且由于农业社的规模小，没力量开发深山区，还经常发生社与社、队与队之间争山争草的矛盾。今年，青龙县各人民公社在中共青龙县委的统一领导下，首先因地制宜地制定出全面发展规划，综合开发利用山川土地，实行农、林、牧、副业互相配合、全面发展。首先固定了现有耕地面积，大力改坡地为梯田，逐步推行梯田耕作园田化，开垦河滩修稻田，尽力提高农业产量。同时停耕陡坡地，改农还林，种植果树。并根据山坡水土流失和水草情况，适当划出林地和牧场，解决农、林、牧互相争坡争地的矛盾。各人民公社在统一规划农、林、牧、果用地的同时，还根据按比例发展的原则，合理划分了各行业使用的劳力。全县各人民公社除抽出70％的劳力从事农业生产外，并抽出了11％的劳力从事林业、畜牧、副业生产。各社队根据劳力分配比例，组成了一千零九十七个专业队，专责专业，固定分工，互相支援。这样就克服了农业社顾此失彼的矛盾，作到统筹兼顾、全面发展。各社队还根据当地具体情况，适当分配了农、林、畜牧所用资金。各社、队将山区建设分成农业、林果、六畜等三条领导战线，由公社党委书记等加强领导。
    现在，全县各公社男女社员，正在加强秋田后期管理，力争秋季大丰收和多种经济的进一步发展。
