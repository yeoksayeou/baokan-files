Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 27th: The Korean people are enthusiastically launching activities to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Today, Pyongyang newspapers published on their front pages an article by Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, written for the Beijing "People's Daily" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, entitled "The Militant Friendship between the Korean and Chinese People." Yesterday, "Rodong Sinmun" published a commemorative article written by Ha Ang-cheon, Chairman of the Korean-Chinese Friendship Association.

Today, the citizens of Pyongyang went to the streets to carry out cleaning and tidying work to welcome the upcoming "Korean-Chinese Friendship Month." The construction project of the "Friendship Tower," symbolizing the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people and commemorating the meritorious deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, has entered its final stage. This tall tower, built of white granite, stands on a hill on the west side of Moranbong, next to Mao Zedong Street, with the golden star on the top and the three golden characters "Friendship Tower" on the body shining brightly. The workers building the tower are working day and night to build the stone railings and stone steps around the tower, and they want to complete the entire "Friendship Tower" before October 1st.

Thirteen factories, schools and institutions, including the Pyongyang Electric Machinery Factory and Kim Il-sung University, held lectures on September 26 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The members of the Korean-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kimchon County, North Hwanghae Province, where rice will have a bumper harvest, recently unanimously passed a resolution at a general meeting of members to celebrate the Chinese brothers' National Day by doing a good job in the autumn harvest, quickly harvesting, quickly threshing and quickly handing over public grain. On the eve of the Chinese people's festival, Volunteer Army Mother Zhao Yuli in this cooperative specially wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers to tell them the news of the bumper harvest.

    平壤市民今天都到街头上进行清扫和整理工作，迎接即将到来的“朝中友好月”。象征着朝中两国人民友谊和纪念中国人民志愿军在朝鲜留下的功勋的“友谊塔”的兴建工程，已经进入最后阶段。这座用白色花岗岩砌成的高塔耸立在毛泽东大街旁、牡丹峰西麓的一个山岗上，塔顶的金星和塔身上的“友谊塔”三个金字闪耀着光芒。筑塔的工人正在日夜赶工修建塔周围的石栏和石阶，他们要在10月1日以前把“友谊塔”全部建成。
    包括平壤电机工厂、金日成综合大学在内的朝鲜北部各地的十三个工厂、学校和机关在26日举行了庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年的讲演会。水稻将获丰收的黄海北道金川郡朝中友谊农业生产合作社社员们，最近在社员大会上一致通过决议，要用做好秋收、快收快打快交公粮来庆祝中国弟兄们的国庆。这个社里的志愿军妈妈赵玉礼在中国人民的节日前夕，特意写信给中国人民志愿军，告诉他们丰收的消息。
