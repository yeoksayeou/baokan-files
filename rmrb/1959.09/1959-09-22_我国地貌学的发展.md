                The Content of Geomorphology
    Geomorphology is the science that studies the forms of the Earth's surface. The undulating shapes of the Earth's surface are exceptionally complex: high mountains and great rivers, fantastic peaks and deep valleys, magnificent coastlines, and boundless plains. Working people come into contact with these landforms in their daily lives and work at all times, and therefore have paid attention to and studied them very early on. More than two thousand years ago, the Chinese book "Erya" had chapters such as "Explanation of Hills," "Explanation of Mountains," and "Explanation of Water." From the perspective of modern science, the study of landforms must examine their external features, their origins, and their developmental history. These three aspects are closely related and are all major areas of modern geomorphological research. External features refer to the morphology of landforms, such as the height and slope of mountains, and the types of valleys. The morphological and quantitative description has immense practical significance. For example, the size, length, and shape of mountain slopes (concave, convex, linear) are factors that must be considered when developing water and soil conservation measures. Dividing mountains into high mountains, middle mountains, low mountains, and hills based on absolute and relative altitude remains an important aspect of geomorphological classification. Origins refer to the formation of landforms. It is now generally recognized that landforms are the result of the interaction of internal and external forces. Internal forces are tectonic and neotectonic movements, while external forces are various erosional and depositional processes acting on the Earth's surface (rivers, glaciers, wind, oceans, etc.). Generally speaking, larger landform features are mainly caused by internal forces. For example, the North China Plain corresponds to a long-term subsidence zone, while the Taihang Mountains are a zone of intense recent uplift. Therefore, the study of internal forces plays an extremely important role in geomorphology. Because the external morphology of landforms is often closely related to their origins, for example, river-eroded valleys have one form, while glacier-eroded valleys have another, morphological description cannot be separated from the study of origins. Like other natural phenomena, landforms are constantly evolving. What we see now is only one stage in a long developmental process. We must study the regional geomorphological development history to understand the structure and morphological characteristics of the region's landforms. For example, the geomorphic development history of the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River can be mainly divided into three periods: the Western Hubei Period (peneplain), the Mountain Plateau Period (late mature peneplain), and the Three Gorges Period (modern gorges). The combination of the ground surface in these three periods determines all the characteristics of the geomorphology of the Three Gorges area.
    From the above content of geomorphology, it is undoubtedly a border science between geology and physical geography. It must draw well on the latest achievements of related natural science departments to enrich its content, improve its theoretical level, and enhance its ability to solve practical problems. Therefore, the foundation of geomorphology is relatively broad. For example, studying the internal forces causing landform formation requires knowledge of geology, geotectonics, geochemistry, and geophysics. Studying external forces requires knowledge of hydrology, ocean physics, and climatology. The study of geomorphological development history must be analyzed comprehensively from both erosion and deposition. Therefore, sedimentology, soil science, and especially Quaternary geology are also closely related to geomorphology. Thus, in the history of geomorphology, we can see that it developed equally from both geography and geology. The experience of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries shows that those engaged in geomorphological research for a long time include both geographers and geologists. After liberation, Chinese scholars had some debates about the nature of geomorphology, that is, whether it is a part of physical geography or a part of geology. There were also some different opinions about whether this science should be called geomorphology or topography. Now it seems that these debates are unnecessary. The scientific content of geomorphology and the needs of production practice determine that in the future, as in the past, it must be carried out by the joint cooperation of geographers and geologists. As K.K. Markov pointed out: "The cooperation of geography and geology guarantees the success of geomorphology."
    The Needs of Production Promote the Development of Geomorphology in China
    Engels said: "Economic needs have been and increasingly are the main driving force for the progress of natural knowledge." (Engels, "To Conrad Schmidt," Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Two-Volume Edition, Vol. 2, p. 495.) If we summarize the development process of geomorphology in China over the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it also eloquently proves the correctness of this conclusion. The actual needs of China's socialist construction have promoted the rapid development of geomorphology, providing it with increasingly rich research materials and greatly improving its scientific level. Now, let's analyze it from the following main aspects:
    (1) River Geomorphology and Karst (Note). In order to comprehensively develop river water resources, since liberation, major rivers in China have been compiled into basin plans (or planning outlines). To carry out this work, it is necessary to conduct a more detailed study of the river's valley landforms and development history, which has powerfully promoted the development of river geomorphology in China. Through various investigations and studies, we have accumulated some data on the geomorphology and development history of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Heilongjiang River, Han River, Xiang River, and other water systems, and put forward some new viewpoints. A valley geomorphological survey was recently conducted on the Jinsha River, which is relatively difficult to access. A more detailed study was conducted on the famous Jinsha River capture problem, correcting some long-standing errors in the past.
    The Three Gorges Hydraulic Hub is the largest water conservancy project in China. Its design poses a series of complex and extensive problems for geomorphic science. For example, the section of the Yangtze River from Ouchikou to Chenglingji is called the Lower Jingjiang River, which is a winding and tortuous river channel with a sinuosity of 2.84, known as the "Nine Bends and Hundred Turns." After the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the Lower Jingjiang River must be thoroughly rectified to allow large ships to directly reach Chongqing. Therefore, the formation and evolution of the Lower Jingjiang River's free meanders has become a project of Three Gorges scientific research. The Department of Geography of Nanjing University has conducted a more detailed study of this issue in recent years, proving that it was formed under unique geological, geomorphological, hydrological, and human activity conditions, and is the product of the comprehensive action of the above three factors. This study not only solved specific problems, but also made new supplements to the theory of free meander formation and development.
    In conjunction with the construction of the Three Gorges Hydraulic Hub, detailed research is needed on the geomorphology of the dam area and reservoir area. Since 1958, the Nanjing Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University have organized the Three Gorges Geomorphology Team to conduct work. They discovered nine terraces on both banks of the Yangtze River Valley between Yichang and Nantuo, correcting the erroneous view that there were no terraces in the Three Gorges. This proves that since the Quaternary period, the Three Gorges area has been in a process of intermittent uplift. The study of this valley geomorphology not only provides scientific data, but also helps solve practical problems. For example, the preliminary dam site of the Three Gorges Reservoir is determined to be near Sandouping, where the thick weathering crust brings certain difficulties to hydraulic construction. The thickness of the weathering crust is closely related to the terraces. Through the analysis and mapping of the terraces, the distribution law of the weathering crust in the area can be grasped more clearly, which will help the selection of the dam site for the Three Gorges Reservoir.
    Limestone is widely distributed in China. Due to the dissolution of running water, special karst landforms are formed in limestone areas. In the past, we only had some fragmented descriptions of karst morphology, and rarely involved the history and development laws of karst. In recent years, specialized research on karst has begun through the construction of hydropower stations and other engineering structures in karst areas. Especially in the Three Gorges area, due to the needs of hydraulic construction, karst research is particularly detailed (mainly the work of the Three Gorges Team of the Ministry of Geology). The karst in the Three Gorges area is mainly divided into three periods: pre-Tertiary karst, Mountain Plateau karst, and modern karst. Karst in different periods has different morphologies, distribution laws, and development intensities. Mastering these laws is of great significance for the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir. It can be said that through the research in the Three Gorges area and other important water conservancy construction areas, a good foundation has been created for the establishment and development of karstology in China.
    (2) Glacial Geomorphology and Glaciology. Although modern glaciers are widely distributed on the high mountains in western China, before liberation, our research on modern glaciers and their landforms was almost blank. Recently, in order to meet the urgent need for water in the Northwest region, it is required to find out the distribution and volume of modern glaciers on the high mountains in the Northwest, so as to take effective measures to melt ice and snow, so that high mountain glaciers can also serve socialist construction. Therefore, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has organized a special team to conduct large-scale investigation and research on modern glaciers in the high mountains of the Northwest region (such as the Qilian Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, etc.). Through this work, the various types and distribution laws of high mountain glaciers in China, as well as the characteristics of glacial landforms and landforms in adjacent glacial areas (periglacial areas) are preliminarily understood, which powerfully promotes the rapid establishment and development of glaciology and glacial geomorphology in China.
    On the other hand, mountaineering sports have advanced by leaps and bounds since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Party and the government attach great importance to scientific research in mountaineering sports. Chinese young geomorphological workers participated in mountaineering sports for the first time in 1957 and studied the modern glaciers and glacial landforms of Mount Gongga (elevation 7,590 meters) in western Sichuan. This year's heroic feat of climbing Mount Muztagata has more geomorphological workers participating, and the scientific gains will definitely be even greater. It can be predicted that with the development of mountaineering sports, the secrets of high mountain glaciers in China will be completely revealed.
    (3) Estuary and Coastal Geomorphology. The study of estuary and coastal geomorphology is of great significance for port construction (siltation of harbors and prevention of coastal erosion), shipping, finding coastal placer deposits, utilizing tidal power for power generation, and national defense. This is a new branch of geomorphology, requiring special equipment (such as boats, diving equipment, etc.) and instruments. This was also completely without foundation in China in the past. After liberation, especially after 1956, due to the attention of the Party and the government, research in this area has gradually been carried out and has achieved initial results. The Department of Geography of East China Normal University has conducted detailed research on the geomorphology of the Yangtze River estuary and the Yangtze River Delta, believing that the ground surface of the Yangtze River Delta has significant recent (geological age) subsidence movement. However, due to the large amount of sediment deposition in the Yangtze River estuary, the delta is still slowly extending towards the sea, while the width of the estuary has decreased significantly. The characteristics of the plain landforms of the Yangtze River Delta are the dish-shaped depressions of the Taihu Plain in the south and the Lixiahe depressions in the north. The reason for their formation is the development of sandbars in the estuary over the past 6,000 years.
    The geomorphic forms and vertical changes (uplift, subsidence) of China's coastline are very complex. In the past, it was believed that the coast north of Hangzhou Bay was an uplifted coast, and the coast south of it was a subsiding coast. Recent studies by many scholars have proved that this view is incorrect. There is a general subsidence phenomenon on China's coast, but different sections have experienced uplift movement recently, resulting in many terraces along the coast, making the coastal geomorphology more complicated.
    In order to solve the practical problems of the national economy, it is necessary to study the erosion and deposition of sea waves and sea currents in the coastal zone with new methods, and master the laws of various processes occurring in the coastal zone. This is the new direction of coastal geomorphology - coastal dynamic geomorphology. For example, to build a seaport, it is necessary to first conduct a coastal dynamic geomorphological survey to understand the hydrological conditions of the coastal zone: the direction and intensity of sediment movement, etc., so as to determine the port site, select the appropriate form, length, and distribution direction of breakwaters based on these data, and predict the changes after port construction, so that the port will not be threatened by sediment siltation. Recently, in cooperation with several important constructions, such as the siltation problem of Tanggu New Port (i.e., the back-silting problem) and the construction of the tidal power station at the Qiantang River estuary, China has begun to study coastal dynamic geomorphology.
    (4) Loess Geomorphology and Dune Geomorphology. The loess covering area in the northwestern provinces of China is very wide (about 370,000 square kilometers). Due to the sparse vegetation on the ground and the loose structure of the loess, and the rainfall is characterized by rainstorms, agricultural production in the northwest has always faced serious loess erosion problems. The Soil and Water Conservation Investigation Team of the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted long-term investigations and studies on this issue. Through this work, we further understand the types and development laws of geomorphology (especially erosion geomorphology) in loess areas, the relationship between geomorphology and soil and water loss, and provide methodological and theoretical basis for how to conduct geomorphological condition surveys and prepare various geomorphological element maps when formulating soil and water conservation plans in a small area or a large area in the future (mainly carried out by the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences). At the same time, it is also determined that Chinese loess can be divided into two major categories: new loess and old loess. Their ages and properties are different. From the particle analysis of a large number of loess samples, it is preliminarily proved that the loess in the middle reaches of the Yellow River is aeolian, and its material source is blown from northwest to southeast by wind.
    The desert area in China accounts for about 11% of the total area of the country, and dunes are often distributed on the ground. The movement of dunes poses a great threat to local agricultural production and transportation construction. After liberation, due to production needs, a few geomorphologists have studied the dunes in northern Shaanxi, believing that the large number of dunes in the area are mainly formed in situ, and are the result of the old society's predatory use of land (overgrazing, firewood, etc.) in the past 200 to 300 years. In 1958, in order to completely transform China's deserts, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has organized a large-scale desert control team to conduct long-term research on China's deserts. It can be expected that many problems of dune geomorphology in China (such as dune types, dune movement, the relationship between dunes and wind, etc.) will be better solved.
    (5) Other aspects. The application of geomorphology in the national economy is multifaceted. Finding useful minerals and exploring groundwater requires understanding regional geomorphological conditions. Therefore, in recent years, geomorphological maps have sometimes been compiled in China's regional geological surveys and hydrogeological surveys, thus rapidly expanding the research area of geomorphology in China. Placer deposits are a special type of mineral deposit buried in loose sediments (mainly Quaternary). Because the distribution of placer deposits is closely related to geomorphology, only by studying the geomorphological conditions in detail can the distribution laws of placer deposits be fully understood. Therefore, geomorphological methods are often the dominant methods in the search and exploration of placer deposits. For example, weathering crust placer deposits are only preserved on ancient denudation surfaces. Therefore, the existence of ancient peneplains or flat denudation surfaces is an important sign for finding weathering crust deposits. The larger the preservation area of the ancient flat denudation surface and the lighter it is cut by modern times, the richer the weathering crust deposits will be. The deeply eroded Nianqingshan Mountains are not conducive to prospecting for weathering crust deposits. In recent years, geomorphological workers in China have also done some work in this area, such as the research on placer deposits in the Liaodong Peninsula and the Shandong Peninsula by the Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University, and the research on weathering crust placer deposits in Yunnan Anding by the Department of Geography of Nanjing University.
    The South-to-North Water Diversion, which diverts the abundant water of the Yangtze River to supply the Northwest and North China, is one of the greatest communist construction plans in China, and has a decisive significance in completely changing the current arid face of the Northwest and North China. The Nanjing Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Department of Geography of Nanjing University recently organized an expedition to investigate the geomorphological conditions of the South-to-North Water Diversion project canal line in the central region between the Three Gorges and the Yellow River. From the comprehensive study of geomorphology, many important suggestions were put forward for the selection of the canal route, which has a greater reference value for further determining the canal line. This investigation directly linked geomorphological research with the construction of large-scale canals, creating conditions for the establishment of a new department of geomorphology - engineering geomorphology.
    Geomorphology is a component of natural conditions. In order to better develop and utilize the natural resources of border areas, in recent years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has organized many comprehensive expeditions to conduct comprehensive and systematic surveys of border areas. Among them, geomorphological research has played a certain role in comprehensively analyzing natural conditions and planning the utilization of natural resources. Through comprehensive surveys, not only a wealth of new and novel geomorphological data have been accumulated for border areas that have been less studied in the past, but also some new projects in geomorphology have been launched, such as the research on neotectonic movement and aeolian landforms by the geomorphology group of the Xinjiang Comprehensive Expedition Team, and the research on slope genesis types by the geomorphology group of the Yunnan Comprehensive Expedition Team, etc.
    Due to the needs of national economic planning, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed the huge work of China's natural zoning. China's geomorphological zoning is a component of China's natural zoning. Under the cooperation of relevant universities and colleges, the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences compiled the Geomorphological Zoning Map of China and its explanatory notes, dividing the country into 18 first-level geomorphological regions and 55 second-level geomorphological regions. This book summarizes the geomorphological research data of China before 1958 and is the first detailed monograph discussing the geomorphology of the whole country, which is of reference value for teaching and production.

      Main Achievements of Geomorphology in China in the Past Ten Years
    According to the above, it should be affirmed that the development of geomorphology in China in the past ten years since liberation has been rapid and the achievements have been great. Among them, the most prominent aspects are the following:
    (1) Made contributions to national socialist construction. Geomorphological workers have made corresponding contributions in water conservancy construction (such as the Three Gorges Hydraulic Hub, the South-to-North Water Diversion canal line, etc.), soil and water conservation, ice and snow melting, desert control, and prospecting and exploration of placer deposits.
    (2) Expanded the field of geomorphological research. Some new research departments have been launched. Coastal dynamic geomorphology, placer deposit geomorphology, modern glacial geomorphology, and engineering geomorphology have all started gradually from scratch with the needs of production development. In terms of region, many areas that have not been researched or have been researched very little in the past have also carried out geomorphological work in recent years. These areas include Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Tibet.
    (3) Began to pay attention to the connection with related disciplines and arm themselves with new theories and methods. For example, the research on river and estuary geomorphology has applied the latest achievements in hydrology. This not only makes the research content more in-depth, but also makes the research results more in line with the actual needs of national socialist construction. Geomorphological surveys have more commonly used aerial photographs, shallow drilling, mechanical analysis, and chemical analysis methods. New research directions such as spore pollen analysis have also begun to receive the attention of geomorphological researchers. The research on coastal dynamic geomorphology considers the use of new methods such as submerged tracer elements (studying coastal sediment movement).
    (4) Accumulated a large amount of new data, and on the basis of new foundations and methods, conducted some summaries of these data, such as compiling the National Geomorphological Zoning Map and its explanatory notes.
    (5) Established majors in universities to specialize in training geomorphological workers. Peking University and Nanjing University have established geomorphology majors, and are considering setting up some specialized courses in the geomorphology major to adapt to the development trend of modern geomorphic science. The training and growth of a large number of new forces has enabled geomorphological work in China to be carried out rapidly. At present, many new and important geomorphological research work is undertaken by young geomorphologists (such as modern glacial geomorphology, coastal geomorphology, etc.).
                Future Prospects
    Geomorphology is a science closely related to national socialist construction. It can be affirmed that with the surge of production, this science will have greater development in the future.
    It should be pointed out that although geomorphology in China has achieved great achievements in the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, on the whole, our professional level is still not high. Geomorphological workers are not familiar enough with the latest achievements of adjacent disciplines, and many new technologies and new methods have not been fully mastered and widely applied. Striving to learn from the Soviet Union and creatively applying the advanced theories and methods of the Soviet Union to solve practical problems in China should be the direction of our efforts for a considerable period of time in the future.
    Geomorphology, like other earth science departments, is a regional science. China has a vast territory and very complex geomorphology. Some geomorphological phenomena are unique to the world. For example, China's karst distribution area is the widest and the types are the most numerous in the world. China's vast accretionary coastline between the Bohai Bay and Lianyungang and the Yangtze River estuary is also unique in the world. The Tibetan Plateau, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level and has an area of more than 2 million square kilometers, is a unique landform in the world. Studying these issues is not only of practical significance, but may also discover new principles and theories from them to enrich the treasure house of world geomorphic science. China's superior socialist system has created good conditions for the development of geomorphology. As long as we continue to study hard and work diligently under the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to climb the highest peak of geomorphic science.
    (Note) Karst is a type of natural geological phenomenon, that is, the dissolution of dolostone, limestone, etc. by groundwater to produce caves.

    我国地貌学的发展
    南京大学地理系主任中国科学院南京地理研究所所长  任美锷
                地貌学的内容
    地貌学是研究地表形态的科学。地球表面的起伏形状是异常复
  杂的，高山大川，奇峰深谷，波涛壮阔的海岸，一望无际的平原，
  劳动人民在日常生活和工作中无时不与这些地貌相接触，因而很早就对它们加以注意和研究。二千多年以前，我国“尔雅”一书就有释丘，释山，释水等篇。从现代科学意义来说，地貌学研究地表形态，必须研究它们的外部特征、成因和发展历史。这三个部分彼此密切相关，都是现代地貌学研究的主要方面。外部特征指地貌的形态，如山岭的高度，坡度，沟谷的类型等。这种形态的和数量的描述在实践上具有巨大的意义，如山岭坡度的大小，长度和形状（凹形的，凸形的，直线形的）是拟制水土保持措施必须考虑的因素；根据绝对高度和相对高度把山岭分为高山、中山、低山和丘陵，仍然是地貌类型划分中的重要内容。成因指地貌的起源，现在大家公认地貌是内力和外力相互作用的结果，内力即大地构造和新构造运动，外力即作用于地面上的各种侵蚀和堆积作用（河流的，冰川的，风的，海洋的等）。一般说来，较大的地貌形态主要由内力造成，如华北平原相当于长期沉降区，太行山地则为近代强烈上升区，因此，内力作用的研究在地貌学中居于极其重要的地位。由于地貌的外部形态常与其成因有密切关系，例如河流侵蚀的谷地是一种形态，冰川侵蚀的谷地又是另一种形态，所以，形态描述不能脱离成因的研讨。和其它自然现象一样，地貌是永远向前发展的，现在所看到的地貌只是漫长发展过程中的一个阶段，我们必须研究区域地貌发展历史，才能了解该区地貌的结构和形态特征。例如，长江三峡地区的地貌发育历史主要可分三个时期，即鄂西期（准平原），山原期（壮年后期夷平面）和三峡期（现代峡谷），这三个时期地面的组合决定了三峡区地貌的全部特征。
    从上述地貌学的内容看来，地貌学无疑是一门介于地质学与自然地理学之间的边缘科学。它必须很好地吸取有关的自然科学部门的最新成就，来充实其内容，提高其理论水平和解决实际问题的能力。所以，地貌学的基础是比较广泛的。例如研究地貌成因的内力作用，须具有地质学，大地构造学，地球化学，地球物理学等知识，研究外力作用须具有水文学，海洋物理学，气候学等知识。地貌发育史的研究须从侵蚀和沉积两方面综合来分析，故沉积学，土壤学，特别是第四纪地质学与地貌学的关系也十分密切。因此，在地貌学的历史中，我们可以看到它是同等地从地理学和地质学内发展起来的。中国、苏联和其他国家的经验都说明：长时期内从事地貌研究的，既有地理学家，也有地质学家。解放后，我国学者对于地貌学的性质，即它是自然地理学的一部分还是地质学的一部分，曾经有过一些争论；对于这门科学应该称为地貌学，或者称为地形学，也出过一些不同意见；现在看来，这些争论都是不必要的。地貌学的科学内容和生产实践的需要决定了它在今后也将如过去一样，须由地理学家和地质学家共同合作来进行研究。正如K·K·马尔科夫所指出：“地理学和地质学的合作，保证了地貌学的成功”。
    生产的需要推动了我国地貌学的发展
    恩格斯说：“经济上的需要曾经是，而且往后越来越是自然知识进展的主要动因”。（恩格斯“致康—施米特”马克思恩格斯文选两卷集，第2卷，495页。）我们总结一下建国十年来我国地貌学的发展过程，也雄辩地证明了这个结论的正确性。我国建设社会主义的实际需要推动了地貌学的飞速发展，给它提供了日益丰富的研究材料，并且大大提高了它的科学水平。现在试从下列几个主要方面来分析：
    （1）河流地貌和喀斯特（注）。为了综合开发河流的水利资源，解放后，我国的主要河流都已编制了流域规划（或规划要点）。进行这项工作，需要对河流的河谷地貌和发育历史作较详细的研究，这就有力地推动了我国河流地貌学的发展。通过各方面调查研究，我们对长江、黄河、黑龙江、汉江、湘江等水系的地貌和发育史都累积了一些资料，提出了若干新的看法。对交通比较困难的金沙江，最近也进行了河谷地貌的调查，并对著名的金沙江袭夺问题作了较详细的研究，纠正了过去长期存在的一些错误。
    长江三峡水力枢纽是我国规模最大的水利建设，它的设计给地貌科学提出了一系列复杂而广泛的问题。例如，长江从藕池口至城陵矶一段称为下荆江，河道蜿蜒曲折，曲折率达二点八四，有九曲回肠之称，三峡水库修建后，必须彻底整治下荆江，才能使巨轮可直达重庆。因此，下荆江自由河曲的形成与演变问题就成为三峡科学研究的一个项目。南京大学地理系近年来对这一问题作了较详细的研究，证明它是在独特的地质、地貌条件、水文条件、和人类活动条件下形成的，是以上三个因素的综合作用的产物。通过这项研究，不但解决了具体问题，并且对自由河曲形成和发育的理论有新的补充。
    结合三峡水力枢纽的建设，需要对坝区和库区的地貌作详细研究。从1958年起，中国科学院南京地理研究所和北京大学地质地理系组织三峡地貌队，进行工作，发现宜昌至南沱间的长江峡谷两岸有九级阶地，纠正了过去认为三峡内无阶地的错误看法，证明从第四纪以来，三峡地区一直是在间歇上升的过程中。这种河谷地貌的研究，不但提供了科学资料，并且也有助于实际问题的解决，例如三峡水库的坝址初步决定在三斗坪附近，该处深厚的风化壳给水工建设带来一定的困难，风化壳的厚度与阶地有密切关系，通过对阶地的分析和制图，可以更清晰地掌握该区风化壳的分布规律，从而对三峡水库的选择坝址有所帮助。
    我国石灰岩分布面积很广，石灰岩地区由于受流水溶蚀，造成特殊的喀斯特地貌。过去，我们仅对喀斯特形态有些片断的描述，很少涉及到喀斯特的历史和发育规律。近年来，通过在喀斯特地区修建水电站和其他工程建筑物，已开始对喀斯特进行专门性的研究。特别在三峡地区，由于水工建设的需要，喀斯特的研究尤为精详（主要是地质部三峡队的工作）。三峡区的喀斯特主要分为三个时期，即前第三纪的喀斯特，山原期的喀斯特和现代的喀斯特。不同时期的喀斯特具有不同的形态、分布规律和发育强度。掌握这些规律，对于三峡水库建设具有重要意义。可以说：通过三峡地区和其他重要水工建设区域的研究，已为喀斯特学在中国的奠立和发展创造了良好的基础。
    （2）冰川地貌和冰川学。虽然我国西部的高山上广泛分布着现代冰川，但在解放前，我们对现代冰川及其地貌的研究却几乎是空白的。最近，为了满足西北地区日益增长的用水的迫切需要，要求摸清西北高山上的现代冰川的分布和体积，以便采取有效措施，融冰化雪，使高山冰川也能为社会主义建设服务。因此，中国科学院已组织了专门的队伍，对西北地区高山（如祁连山，天山等）的现代冰川进行大规模的调查研究，通过这项工作，初步了解我国高山冰川的各种类型和其分布规律，以及冰川地貌和邻近冰川地区（冰缘地区）地貌的特征，有力地推动冰川学和冰川地貌学在我国的迅速建立和发展。
    另一方面，登山运动在建国以来飞跃前进，党和政府在登山运动中十分重视科学研究工作，我国青年地貌工作者在1957年第一次参加了登山运动，研究了四川西部贡噶山（海拔七千五百九十米）的现代冰川和冰川地貌。今年攀登慕士塔格山的壮举，有更多的地貌工作者参加，科学上的收获一定更加巨大。可以预料：随着登山运动的开展，我国高山冰川的秘密将被完全揭开。
    （3）河口和海岸地貌。河口和海岸地貌的研究对于港口建设（港湾的淤塞和防止海岸的冲毁）、航运、寻找海岸砂矿、利用潮汐的发电和国防都有重大意义。这是地貌学的一个新的分支，需要特殊的装备（如船只，潜水设备等）和仪器。这在我国过去也是完全没有基础的。解放后，特别是1956年以后，由于党和政府的重视，这方面的研究已经逐步开展，并且取得了初步的成绩。华东师范大学地理系详细研究了长江江口和长江三角洲的地貌，认为长江三角洲的地面近期（地质时代）有显著的下降运动，但由于长江江口大量泥沙的淤积，故三角洲仍在缓慢地向海伸展着，而江口的宽度则显著减小。长江三角洲平原地貌的特征是南有太湖平原碟形洼地，北有里下河洼地，其形成原因是由于最近六千年来江口砂嘴的发展。
    我国海岸的地貌形态和垂直变动（上升，下降）都十分复杂。过去认为杭州湾以北为上升海岸，以南为下沉海岸。近年许多学者的研究证明，这种看法是不正确的。我国海岸有普遍下降现象，但不同的地段在最近又有上升运动，造成了沿海的许多阶地，使海岸地貌更加复杂化。
    为了解决国民经济的实际问题，必须用新的方法研究海岸带的海浪和海流的侵蚀和沉积作用，掌握海岸带所发生的各种过程的规律，这便是海岸地貌学的新的方向——海岸动力地貌学。譬如要建筑海港，就必须先进行海岸动力地貌的调查研究，了解海岸带的水文情况：泥沙移动的方向，强度等，以便根据这些资料，确定港址，选择合用的防波堤的形式，长度和分布方向，并预测出建港以后的变化情况，这样就可使港口不至受到泥沙淤塞的威胁。最近配合若干重要建设，如塘沽新港的泥沙淤塞问题（即回淤问题），钱塘江口潮汐发电站的建设问题等，我国已开始对海岸动力地貌进行研究。
    （4）黄土地貌和沙丘地貌。我国西北诸省黄土复盖面积很广（约三十七万方公里），由于地面植被贫乏，黄土结构疏松，降雨又具有暴雨性质，故西北农业生产过去一直面临着严重的黄土侵蚀问题。中国科学院黄河中游水土保持考察队曾对此问题作长期调查研究，通过此项工作，使我们进一步了解黄土地区的地貌（特别是侵蚀地貌）类型和发育规律，地貌与水土流失的关系，并为我国今后不论在一个小区范围内，或大区范围内，制订水土保持规划时，如何从地貌条件的调查，编制各种地貌要素图，提供方法上和理论上的依据（主要由中国科学院地理研究所进行）。同时，还确定中国黄土可分为新黄土和老黄土两大类，它们的时代和性质是不同的；从大量黄土标本的颗粒分析，初步证明黄河中游的黄土是风成的，其物质来源是由风从西北向东南吹送而来。
    我国沙漠面积约占全国总面积11％，地面上常有砂丘分布，砂丘的移动给当地农业生产和交通建设带来很大威胁。解放后，由于生产上需要，少数地貌学者曾对陕北砂丘进行研究，认为该区的大量沙丘主要是就地形成的，是过去二百至三百年来旧社会掠夺性地利用土地（过度放牧，打柴草等）的结果。1958年，为了彻底的改造我国的沙漠，中国科学院已经组织了大规模的治沙队对我国沙漠进行长期研究，可以预期，我国砂丘地貌的许多问题（如沙丘类型，沙丘移动，沙丘与风的关系等等）将会获得更好的解决。
    （5）其他方面。地貌学在国民经济上的应用是多方面的。寻找有用矿产和勘探地下水需要了解区域地貌情况，因此，近年来，我国区域地质测量和水文地质测量中有时也编制地貌图，这样，就使我国地貌学的研究地区迅速扩大。砂矿是埋藏在松散堆积物（主要是第四纪的）中的一种特殊类型的矿床，由于砂矿的分布与地貌有密切关系，只有详细研究了地貌条件，才能完全明了砂矿的分布规律，故在寻找与勘探砂矿时，地貌学方法常是主导的方法。譬如风化壳砂矿只保存在古老的剥蚀面上，故古准平原或平坦的剥蚀面的存在为寻找风化壳矿床的重要标帜，古平地剥蚀面的保存面积愈大，受现代的切割愈轻，则风化壳矿床愈富。侵蚀很深的年青山地不利于普查风化矿床。近年来，我国地貌工作者在这方面也作了一些工作，如北京大学地质地理系对辽东半岛和山东半岛砂矿的研究，南京大学地理系对云南安定风化壳砂矿的研究等。
    南水北调，引用长江丰富水量接济西北和华北，是我国最伟大的共产主义建设计划之一，对于彻底改变目前西北和华北的干旱面貌具有决定的意义。中国科学院南京地理研究所和南京大学地理系最近组织考察队，调查了三峡至黄河间的中部地区南水北调计划渠线的地貌条件，从地貌的综合研究，对渠道路线的选择提出了许多重要建议，对于进一步确定渠线有较大的参考价值。这次调查使地貌研究直接与大型渠道的建设联系起来，为地貌学的一个新部门——工程地貌学的创立创造了条件。
    地貌是自然条件的一个组成要素。为了更好地开发和利用边疆地区的自然资源，近年来中国科学院组织许多综合考察队，对边疆地区进行全面的系统的调查，其中地貌研究对于全面分析自然条件和规划利用自然资源起了一定的作用。通过综合考察，不但对过去研究较少的边疆地区累积了丰富新颖的地貌资料，并且还开展了地貌学中的一些新项目的研究，如新疆综合考察队地貌组对新构造运动和风成地貌的研究，云南综合考察队地貌组对坡度成因类型的研究等等。
    由于全国经济规划的需要，中国科学院完成了中国自然区划的巨大工作。中国地貌区划是中国自然区划的一个组成部分，中国科学院地理研究所在有关高等院校的协作下，编成中国地貌区划图和说明书，把全国分为十八个一级地貌区和五十五个二级地貌区。该书总结了1958年以前的中国地貌研究资料，是第一本较详细的论述全国地貌的专著，对于教学和生产都有参考价值。
      十年来我国地貌学的主要成就
    根据以上所述，应当肯定：解放十年来，我国地貌学的发展是迅速的，成就是巨大的。其中最突出的约有下列几方面：
    （1）为国家社会主义建设作出了贡献。在水利建设（如三峡水利枢纽，南水北调渠线等）、水土保持、融冰化雪、治理沙漠、普查和勘探砂矿等，地貌工作者都作出了相应的贡献。
    （2）扩大了地貌学研究的领域。开展了一些新的研究部门，如海岸动力地貌，砂矿地貌，现代冰川地貌，工程地貌等都是从无到有，随着生产发展的需要，逐步开始的。在地域上，许多过去没有进行过研究或研究极少的地区，近年来也都开展了地貌工作，这些地区包括新疆、黑龙江、云南、青海和西藏等。
    （3）开始注意同有关学科的联系，用新的理论和方法武装自己。如河流和河口地貌的研究应用了水文学上的最新成就，这样，不但使研究内容比较深入，同时也使研究结果更符合于国家社会主义建设的实际需要。地貌调查已比较普遍地利用航空照片，浅钻、机械分析和化学分析等方法。孢子花粉分析等新的研究方向也开始受到地貌学研究者的注意。海岸动力地貌的研究则考虑使用潜水示踪元素（研究海岸泥沙运动）等新方法。
    （4）累积了大量新的资料，在新的基础和方法上，对这些资料进行了一些总结，如编制全国地貌区划图和说明书等。
    （5）高等学校中建立了专门培养地貌工作者的专业。北京大学和南京大学都设立了地貌专业，并考虑在地貌专业内设立一些专门课程，以适应现代地貌科学发展的趋势。大量新生力量的培养和长成使我国地貌工作得以迅速开展，目前许多新的重要地貌研究工作都是青年地貌学家担任的（如现代冰川地貌，海岸地貌等等）。
                今后展望
    地貌学是与国家社会主义建设有密切关系的科学，可以肯定，随着生产的高涨，这门科学今后将会有更大的发展。
    应当指出：建国十年来，我国地貌学虽然已经取得巨大的成就，但总的来说，我们的业务水平还是不高的，地貌工作者对相邻学科的最新成就还不够熟识，许多新技术和新方法也还没有被完全掌握和普遍应用。努力学习苏联，创造性地运用苏联的先进理论和方法，来解决中国实际问题，应该是今后相当长时期内我们的努力方向。
    地貌学和其他地学部门一样，是地域性的科学。我国疆域广大，地貌十分复杂，某些地貌现象是世界所特有的，例如我国喀斯特分布面积之广，类型之多，在世界首屈一指；我国渤海湾和连云港与长江口间的广阔淤积海岸也为世界所仅见；海拔四千公尺以上，面积二百多万方公里的西藏高原是世界独特的地貌；对这些问题进行研究，不但具有实践意义，而且还可能从中发现新的原则和理论，来丰富世界地貌科学的宝库。我国的社会主义优越制度已经为地貌的发展创造了良好条件，只要我们在党的领导下继续努力学习，辛勤劳动，我们一定能够攀登地貌科学的最高峰。
    （注）喀斯特是自然地质现象的一种，即白云岩、石灰岩等受了地下水流侵蚀所产生的溶洞。
