　　(Reported by this newspaper) The XinJian Brigade of Changhou Commune in Nanxian, Hunan Province, is diligent and thrifty, displaying a spirit of practical, hard, and clever work. They meticulously calculate everything, pay attention to diligence and frugality in all matters, and focus on reducing costs, increasing production, and increasing income, achieving great results.

　　This brigade's economic conditions were not very good. At the end of March this year, apart from seeds and some fixed assets, they had no cash. However, under the unified leadership and assistance of the People's Commune, after several months of hard work, they have broadly expanded their sources of income, not only solving all production costs but also distributing more than 6,100 yuan in wages each month.

　　　　Everyone Diligent, Everywhere Thrifty

　　When this brigade began formulating the "Thousand Catty Yield Plan" and the "Three Guarantees" program, some cadres and members did not fully understand the significance of continuing to adhere to diligence and thrift in running the brigade after communization. They said, "The commune has a large family and a thriving business; spending a little more money doesn't matter." "Empty hands cannot generate wealth; little investment cannot produce a thousand catties." However, most members believed that because the commune had a large family and a thriving business, it should be even more diligent and thrifty, using one yuan as if it were two, and living within its means. They said, "Building a home is like picking dirt with a needle; ruining a home is like pushing sand with water. Without diligence and thrift, you cannot build a home." These two different ideas were sharply opposed, causing a fierce debate. After studying this situation, the brigade's general branch launched a discussion among all cadres and members on "Why should we run the brigade diligently and thriftily? How should we run the brigade diligently and thriftily?" First, they cited typical examples of diligence and waste from last year to calculate and compare the results. Last year, the average yield of grain per mu in Xin'an First Team was 730 catties, a great increase compared to previous years. However, because production did not consider costs, production expenses accounted for 43.5% of total income. Under the same production conditions, Xin'an Eleventh Team had a yield of 741 catties of paddy rice per mu, but because non-production expenses were low, production expenses accounted for only 16.8% of total income, ensuring increased production and income. Through factual comparative education, people generally realized the importance of running the brigade diligently and thriftily. On the basis of unified thinking, they formulated a thousand-catty production plan and a "Three Guarantees" program. The entire brigade "guarantees" a total grain output of 5.28 million catties, an increase of 46.3% per mu compared to last year. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations is 550,000 yuan, an increase of 85% compared to last year. The total expenditure on agricultural and sideline production is 76,000 yuan, accounting for 13.72% of the total income, a decrease of 17.3% compared to last year. In order to ensure the realization of the production plan and the "Three Guarantees," the brigade established an Increase Production and Conserve Committee, putting forward the slogan "Everyone diligent, every day diligent, everywhere thrifty, everything thrifty, not winning a thousand catties, never give up." A mass movement for increasing production and conserving resources was launched enthusiastically.

　　　　Making Do With What One Has, Replacing New With Old

　　Non-production expenses are strictly compressed, and production requires careful calculation, spending less money to do more things. This brigade adheres to this principle from cadres to members. They widely adopt methods such as making do with what one has, using local materials, replacing new with old, replacing foreign with local, replacing new products with waste products, and using one thing for multiple purposes, saving large amounts of materials.

　　One can see a diligent and simple style from the brigade headquarters. Paper is used on one side and then turned over to use the other side; for accounting books, in addition to a few new books issued uniformly by the commune, they used more than 1,000 blank pages from old books and fourteen old binders; when announcing work points and financial accounts every ten days, they used door panels instead of paper boards. In terms of accumulating fertilizer, they advocate diligent accumulation, diligent picking up, diligent sweeping, diligent hoeing, diligent planting, diligent soaking, and diligent making, often collecting household fertilizer and trying to buy as little commercial fertilizer as possible. In addition to producing more than 160,000 catties of local chemical fertilizer, each canteen has an ammonia water stove, which can produce more than 2,000 catties of ammonia water and more than 10,000 catties of smoked soil every month. At the same time, they adopted a method of pricing household fertilizer according to quality, so that every bit of household fertilizer serves production. Currently, the average expenditure on commercial fertilizer per mu in the entire brigade is only 1.28 yuan. So far, the total agricultural production expenditure of the entire brigade is more than 22,000 yuan, accounting for only 32% of the total planned expenditure.

　　　　Adapting to Local Conditions, Broadening Sources of Income

　　In order to increase production and income, this brigade overcame various difficulties and actively mobilized its members to work diligently, exploring all the tricks that are conducive to increasing income. First, in the spirit of planting more and harvesting more, they vigorously expanded grain planting. In addition to expanding the planting of 1,000 mu of lake fields, they also organized a 30-person expedition team to Yifengyuan, 20 miles away, to enclose the lake and block the mouth, drain water and move seedlings, expanding grain planting by 400 mu, which is expected to increase grain production by 950,000 catties. Second, based on the principle of relying on the mountains to eat mountains and relying on the water to eat water, adapting to local conditions, they organized a fishing team by finding ways to increase production and consulting technical personnel. In three months, they earned 3,200 yuan in cash. Third, utilizing the natural water algae feed of Datong Lake and the Huping pasture, they organized two animal husbandry teams, raising 180 pigs and grazing 3,800 lake ducks. Currently, they have earned more than 7,300 yuan in cash. Fourth, they use idle land such as the edges of villages, river banks, roadsides, and field ridges to plant sunflowers, melons, vegetables, and beans. Fifth, they use professional technicians to seize cash. The brigade organized wood and bamboo joint factories, sewing, weaving rain capes, weaving bamboo hats, transportation, etc., earning a total of 11,000 yuan in cash. The entire brigade earned a total of 42,600 yuan in cash, with an average income of 13.7 yuan per person, completing the annual industrial and sideline income plan in one season.

　　　　Establishing Systems, Democratic Management

　　"Steel is used on the blade, and you shouldn't be stingy with money that should be spent." They correctly recognized the relationship between saving for the sake of increasing production and the necessity of saving in order to increase production. Therefore, they are not stingy with money that should be spent on production. In the past three months, the entire brigade has added 15 head of draught cattle, purchased 640 yuan worth of fishing tools, and built a control gate, increasing the capacity for self-flowing drainage and irrigation for 4,000 mu of paddy fields. These have laid a material foundation for the great leap forward in production. When spending money, they use one yuan as if it were two. For example, when purchasing draught cattle, they send people to the production areas to purchase young cattle, which is half the price of buying cattle locally. They only buy raw materials for fishing tools, and making them themselves saves much more than buying finished products. They use self-produced cement and three-in-one soil to repair water gates.

　　In addition to strengthening political and ideological education for cadres and members, this brigade has another experience: fully mobilizing the masses, democratically managing finance, and establishing and improving financial systems at all levels. In terms of expenditure, they strictly implement approval procedures, and in terms of various production expenses, they have implemented a system of financial contracting with surplus retention and no compensation for overspending at each level. Agricultural implements are subject to "Three Guarantees" (guaranteeing wear and tear, oil washing, and service life), and industry and sideline occupations are subject to monthly cost accounting. In cash management, they implement the principle that production teams do not save money and brigades save as little money as possible. In order to consistently adhere to the policy of running the brigade diligently and thriftily, while establishing and improving financial systems, they mobilized small teams and members to formulate plans for increasing production and conserving resources, and launched a "four comparisons" competition between teams and groups: comparing diligent and thrifty brigade management, comparing savings in expenses, comparing care for public property, and comparing compliance with financial systems.

　　Now, a valuable atmosphere of diligence and frugality has formed throughout the team. (Attached picture)

### 家大业大勤俭为上　精打细算能省就省  新建大队勤劳节俭蔚然成风

    家大业大勤俭为上　精打细算能省就省
    新建大队勤劳节俭蔚然成风
    本报讯　湖南南县长厚公社新建大队，克勤克俭，发挥实干、苦干、巧干精神，处处精打细算，事事讲究勤俭，注意降低成本，增加生产，增加收入，取得很大的成绩。
    这个大队经济条件不怎么好。今年3月底，除了种子和一些固定资产外，没有现金。但是在人民公社的统一领导和帮助下，经过几个月的艰苦奋战，广辟财源，不仅解决了全部生产费用，而且还按月发放工资六千一百多元。
        人人勤劳　处处节俭
    这个大队开始制订千斤丰产计划和“三包”方案的时候，有部分干部和社员对公社化后继续坚持勤俭办社的意义认识不足。他们说：“公社家大业大，多花点钱不算什么。”“白手不能生财，本少就干不出千斤来”。但是，多数社员却认为公社家大业大，更应克勤克俭，一个钱要当两个钱用，要量入为出。他们说：“成家好比针挑土，败家好比水推沙，不勤不俭不能成家。”这两种不同的思想针锋相对，引起了一场激烈的辩论。大队总支研究了这一情况后，在全大队干部群众中开展了“为什么要勤俭办社？怎样勤俭办社？”的讨论。首先举出去年勤俭与浪费的典型事实算账对比。去年新安一队平均亩产粮食七百三十斤，比往年大大的增产了。但是由于生产不计成本，生产费支出占总收入的43.5％。同样生产条件的新安十一队，水田亩产七百四十一斤，由于非生产费用开支少，生产费只占总收入的16.8％，保证了增产增收。通过事实的对比教育，普遍认识到了勤俭办社的重要。在统一思想认识的基础上，制定了千斤生产计划和“三包”方案。全大队“三包”粮食总产量五百二十八万斤，比去年亩产增加46.3％。农副业总收入五十五万元，比去年增加85％。农副业生产费总支出七万六千元，占总收入13.72％，比去年减少了17.3％。为了保证生产计划和“三包”的实现，大队成立了增产节约委员会，提出了“人人勤，日日勤，处处俭，事事俭，不夺千斤不罢休”的口号。群众性的增产节约运动火热地开展起来了。
        因陋就简　以旧代新
    非生产开支严格压缩，生产要精打细算，花少量的钱办更多的事。这个大队从干部到社员共同遵守了这一原则。他们广泛地采用了因陋就简、就地取材、以旧代新、以土代洋、以废物代新品、一物数用等方法，节省大批物资。
    人们从大队部就可以看出一种勤俭朴素的风格。纸张用了一面翻过来又用反面；会计账簿，除公社统一发了几本新账外，他们利用了一千多页旧账空页和十四个旧账夹；每十天公布工分、财务账目时，用门板代替纸榜。在积肥方面，提倡勤积、勤拾、勤扫、勤锄、勤种、勤沤、勤制，经常收集家肥，尽量少买商品肥。他们除自造土化肥十六万多斤外，每个食堂都设有氨水灶，每月能产氨水二千多斤，烟熏土一万多斤。同时，对社员家肥采取了按质论价的办法，使点滴家肥都为生产服务。目前全大队平均每亩商品肥料开支只一元二角八分。全大队到目前止，农业生产费用支出二万二千多元，只占总计划支出的32％。
        因地制宜　广辟财源
    为了增加产量，增加收入，这个大队克服各种困难，积极发动社员勤劳生产，把有利于增加收入的窍门都挖掘出来。首先，本着多种多收的精神，大力扩种粮食，除扩种了一千亩湖田，还组织了三十人的远征队，到二十里外的益丰垸，围湖堵口、排水移苗，扩种粮食四百亩，预计共可增产粮食九十五万斤。其次，根据靠山吃山，靠水吃水，因地制宜的原则，通过找增产门路，查技术人员，组织了捕鱼专业队，三个月收入现金三千二百元。第三，利用大通湖天然水藻饲料和湖坪牧场，组织两个牧业队，养猪一百八十头，牧湖鸭三千八百只。目前已收入现金七千三百多元。第四，利用村头岸旁、路边田塍等空闲地，种植向日葵、瓜菜和豆类等。第五，运用专业技术人员抓现金，大队组织木篾联合工厂、缝纫、织蓑衣、编斗笠、运输等共收入现金一万一千元。全大队共收入现金四万二千六百元，平均每人收入十三元七角，一季就完成了全年工业和副业收入计划。
        建立制度　民主管理
    “钢火上在刀口上，该花钱的不吝惜”。他们正确认识到了节约为了增产、增产必须节约的关系。因此，在生产上当用的钱不吝惜。全大队三个月来添购耕牛十五头；购买六百四十元的捕鱼工具；兴建一座节制闸，使四千亩稻田增加自流排灌能力。这些都为生产大跃进奠定了物质基础。他们在用钱时却又把一个钱当两个钱用，如购耕牛是派人到产区购子牛，比在本地购牛便宜一半；捕鱼工具只买原料，自己制造比买成品要节省得多；修水闸用自产水泥和三合土。
    除了对干部和社员加强政治思想教育外，这个大队还有一条经验是：充分发动群众，民主管理财政，逐级建立和健全了财务制度。在开支上严格审批手续，在各项生产费用上，逐层实行了节余留用、超过不补的财务包干。农具实行了“三包”（包损耗、油洗、使用年限），工业、副业实行了按月成本核算等制度。在现金管理上贯彻执行了生产队不存钱，大队少存钱的原则。为了把勤俭办社方针经常坚持下去，在建立和健全财务制度的同时，发动小队和社员订立增产节约计划，并在队、组之间开展了比勤俭办社、比节约开支、比爱护公共财物、比遵守财务制度的“四比”竞赛。
    现在，一种可贵的勤俭风气已在全队形成。（附图片）
