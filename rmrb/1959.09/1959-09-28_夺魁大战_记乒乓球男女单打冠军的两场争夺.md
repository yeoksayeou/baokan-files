　　Battle for the Crown
　　——A Record of the Men's and Women's Singles Championship Contests in Table Tennis
　　Our Correspondents Zuo Ji, Xu Ben
　　A burst of enthusiastic applause broke the pre-match tranquility of the Beijing Gymnasium. Last night, the nation's most outstanding table tennis players engaged in their final decisive battles here. Who exactly would seize this singles championship? Was it Wang Chuanyao, or Zhuang Jiafu? Was it Hu Keming, or Ye Peiqiong?

　　Wang Chuanyao’s Bold Strokes
　　Standing opposite Wang Chuanyao was Zhuang Jiafu, known for his steady and resilient defensive and offensive style using a horizontal racket and chop strokes. As the battle commenced, the two sides traded points from one-to-one to five-to-five. At this point, Wang Chuanyao intensified his efforts with a series of powerful smashes, the ball flying swiftly left and right, giving him a significant lead. In this game, Wang Chuanyao’s smashes were particularly effective, allowing him to win the first game 21-15.

　　Zhuang Jiafu was well aware of the power of Wang's forceful strokes. Therefore, he faced the challenge without fear, responding calmly. He suddenly unleashed a sweeping forehand, winning two consecutive games. In the fourth game, Zhuang Jiafu continued his momentum and took the lead. Wang Chuanyao fought hard to catch up, tying the score several times, but ultimately remained at a disadvantage of 17-20. Zhuang Jiafu needed only one more point to end the match. Wang Chuanyao glanced at the scoreboard, steadied himself, and served the ball. After several strokes to the left and right, the score was tied at 20-all, followed by 21-all, and 22-all. Before the audience's cheers could subside, Wang Chuanyao unleashed two powerful smashes, reclaiming the game.

　　The fifth game was evenly matched from the start, with the score tied eleven times, highlighting the intensity of the competition. Each time Wang Chuanyao smashed left and right, Zhuang Jiafu, positioned five feet away from the table, managed to chop the ball back. The audience praised Wang Chuanyao's nationally renowned power, and also admired Zhuang Jiafu's steady and stable defense. After 14-all, Wang Chuanyao connected several hard hits in a row to settle the match with 21-15.

　　Hu Keming’s Composure and Resourcefulness
　　The nineteen-year-old Hu Keming (Guangdong) faced Ye Peiqiong (Beijing) for the second time last night, competing for the women's singles championship. Their first encounter was during the team finals. In that match, Hu Keming lost both games despite leading at crucial moments because of her impatience.

　　But this time, it was completely different. The night before, Hu Keming adopted a strategy of left-push and right-attack against Qiu Zhonghui, an aggressive player, winning with a quick and decisive three-to-zero victory. This evening, she faced Ye Peiqiong, known for her steady chop defense, but she appeared composed and resourceful. From the start, Hu Keming was calm and collected, exchanging pushes with Ye Peiqiong, and seizing opportunities to smash the ball hard into the opponent’s left and right corners, thus taking the initiative. Although the experienced Ye Peiqiong defended vigorously, Hu Keming’s accurate and fierce smashes were too much, resulting in a 19-21 loss in the first game. In this game, Hu Keming scored fourteen points through smashes alone. In the second game, Ye Peiqiong added spin and forced angles, but Hu Keming switched between long smashes and light drops, tying the score at 19-all, 20-all, and 21-all. Hu connected with three consecutive kills, but Ye steadily chopped the ball back. Hu cleverly dropped a short ball in front of the net, drawing her opponent closer to the table, and then smashing it for the kill. Subsequently, Ye Peiqiong's return hit the net, and Hu Keming won the second game.

　　Having lost the first two games, Ye Peiqiong remained unyielding and steadfast, defending her position tenaciously, darting forward and backward, and repeatedly saving Hu Keming’s continuous smashes, eventually launching a sudden counterattack, winning a game with 22-20. In the fourth game, Hu Keming combined chops and attacks with loop drives, first performing several loop drives to the opponent's left corner, then suddenly attacking the right corner, taking the lead throughout. Finally, she won again with 21-15, securing the women's singles championship.

    夺魁大战
     ——记乒乓球男女单打冠军的两场争夺
    本报记者　作骥　徐奔
    一阵热烈的鼓掌声，打破了北京体育馆比赛前夕的宁静。昨晚，全国最优秀的乒乓选手们在这里进行了最后的决战。究竟谁能够夺得这次单打冠军？是王传耀，还是庄家富？是胡克明，还是叶珮琼？
    王传耀大刀阔斧
    站在王传耀对面的是善守能攻以横板削球稳健坚韧著称的庄家富。大战才开始，双方就从一比一到五比五交替得分。这时王传耀加把劲一阵猛抽，球儿忽左忽右，比分遥遥领先。这一局，王传耀抽来得心应手，以二十一比十五先胜。
    王的这股大板抽击的威力，庄家富十分清楚，因此毫无畏惧，沉着应战，他猛然起板横扫，连胜两局。第四局，庄家富又乘胜领先，王传耀奋力追赶，数度打成平手，但最后仍然处于十七比二十的劣势，庄家富只要再拿下一分，这场决战便告结束。王传耀看了看记分牌，定一定神，球儿随即发了出去，几回左右开弓，打成二十平，接着又是二十一平、二十二平。观众叫好声尚未平息，两下猛抽，王传耀又夺回一局。
    第五局才打响，就旗鼓相当，双方打成十一次平手，争夺十分激烈。每次王传耀左抽右击，都被离台五尺远的庄家富削了过去，观众赞扬击球力量雄冠全国的王传耀，也佩服庄家富的稳削稳打。十四平后，王传耀连连几板硬扣，以二十一比十五定下大局。
    胡克明沉着机智
    十九岁的姑娘胡克明（广东）昨晚第二次和叶珮琼（北京）交手，争夺女子单打冠军。她俩第一次交手是在团体决赛时。那次相逢，胡克明由于在紧要关头表现急躁，两局都在领先的优势下反而败北。
    可是这次截然不同了。前一天晚上，胡克明采取左推右攻同攻球手丘钟惠接战，打了个快速利落的漂亮仗，以三比零战胜了对手。这晚她再度同以稳健削球防守著称的叶珮琼交锋，却变得沉着、机智。一上场，胡克明便从容不迫，和叶珮琼对搓，瞄准机会即挥拍猛击对方左右两角，掌握了主动。经验丰富的叶珮琼虽经奋力防守，无奈胡克明抽出的球凶狠而准确，十九比二十一先负一局。这一局，胡克明光是抽球就得了十四分。第二局叶珮琼加转逼角，胡克明忽而长抽，忽而轻吊，打成十九平、二十平、二十一平。胡连续三板扣杀，叶却稳稳削回，胡机智地突然轻吊一个网前短球，引对方走近台前即大板扣死。接着叶珮琼接球落网，胡克明再胜第二局。
    先负两局后，叶珮琼仍不松不懈，顽强固守阵地，前奔后退，多次救回胡克明连续抽出的来球，并突然反击，以二十二比二十扳回一局。胡克明在第四局中以搓攻结合拉攻，向对方左角先拉几板，然后向右角突施杀手，又一直领先。最后以二十一比十五再胜，夺得女子单打冠军。
