Explanation of Terms

    Dye Uptake Rate: A certain amount of dye is dissolved in water, the material to be dyed is placed in it, and salt is added to allow the dye to enter the fiber and chemically react with it. This is dyeing. During the dyeing process, the more dye that is absorbed by the fabric, the higher the dye uptake rate, the more dye is saved, and the lower the production cost of the printing and dyeing factory.
    Dye Fixation Rate: After the dye is absorbed onto the fiber, some of the dye floats on the surface of the fabric, called floating color, which will be washed away during washing and soap boiling. The ratio of the amount of dye remaining on the fabric to the amount of dye originally used during dyeing is the dye fixation rate. Only when the dye uptake rate is high and the dye fixation rate is also high can the utilization rate of the dye be truly improved.
    Solubility: Refers to how much dye can be dissolved in a certain amount of water. If the solubility is high, the same amount of dye can be used to dye a very deep color; conversely, if the dye cannot be dissolved in water and precipitates, it will not only waste dye but also stick to the fabric, producing dotted mottles.

    名词解释
    吸色率：一定数量的染料溶化在水里，把染物放进去，加入食盐，使染料进入纤维，和纤维起化合作用，这就是染色。染色过程中，染上织物的染料越多，吸色率就越高，染料就节省得越多，印染厂的生产成本也就越低。
    固色率：染料吸到纤维上以后，部分染料浮在织物表面，称为浮色，在水洗、皂煮时会被洗掉。最后留在织物上的染料，数量多少和原来染色时用的染料数量之比，就是固色率。如果吸色率高，固色率也高，染料的利用率才能真正提高。
    溶解度：指在一定数量的水中可以溶化多少染料。如果溶解度高，用同样多的染料、颜色可以染得很深；相反，如果染料在水里化不开，发生沉淀，既会浪费染料，又会沾在布上，产生点点花斑。
