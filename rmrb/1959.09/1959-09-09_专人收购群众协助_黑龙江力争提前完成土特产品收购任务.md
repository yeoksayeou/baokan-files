Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th: Responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, the staff and workers on the commercial front in Heilongjiang Province are determined to fight for four months to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline native products and the supply of autumn and winter production materials and winter commodities. They also proposed to complete the third quarter procurement plan ten days ahead of schedule to welcome the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

After the People's Daily published the editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Sentiments, Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" in early August, especially after the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were released, commercial employees throughout the province, after study and discussion, launched a competition upsurge of vowing to compete, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Currently, it is the peak season for the production of some non-staple foods and native products, and it is also the slack season before the autumn harvest begins. Commercial employees are seizing this opportunity, using the experience of combining regular procurement with surprise procurement, and combining professional procurement personnel with organized mass assistance procurement, which proved effective last year. They are carrying out a mass procurement movement of going up the mountains to collect, going down to the countryside to collect, everyone collecting, and every store collecting. They are actively purchasing rural sideline products and native products such as rosin, earth alkali, fur, woven products, reeds, and industrial raw materials. The Qinggang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's communes organized agricultural and sideline product procurement headquarters, drawing cadres from various departments to form procurement teams of more than 1,800 people in cooperation with commercial departments to purchase live pigs and eggs. The county's third-quarter live pig procurement plan and the annual fresh egg procurement plan were completed ahead of schedule on September 2nd. The Weihe Commune in the mountainous Shangzhi County organized a procurement team of more than 4,000 people, divided into specialized groups for collecting tree seeds, digging ginseng, picking mushrooms, and cutting sheep grass, fighting in the mountains and fields. From August 26th to 31st, in six days, the province purchased a total of 30,000 pigs, an average of 5,000 pigs per day, an increase of more than fifteen times compared to the daily procurement volume before August 20th. The procurement volume on September 1st increased even further to more than 9,100 pigs. Now, nine counties, including Qinggang and Kedong, have completed the third-quarter live pig procurement and transfer tasks ahead of schedule.

While purchasing, commercial departments in various places are actively organizing the supply of urban industrial products to the countryside. The director of the Yuanda Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lanxi County carries burdens every day, delivering daily-use industrial products to farmers' homes, supplying them on one hand and purchasing on the other, which the masses are very satisfied with.

    专人收购群众协助
    黑龙江力争提前完成土特产品收购任务
    新华社哈尔滨8日电　黑龙江省商业战线的职工响应党中央的号召，决心大战四个月，做好农副土特产品的收购和秋冬生产资料、冬令商品的供应工作。他们还提出，要提前十天完成第三季度的采购计划，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    在人民日报8月初发表“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论，特别是党的八届八中全会公报和决议发布以后，全省商业职工经过学习和讨论，掀起了誓师比武、学先进赶先进的竞赛热潮。当前正是一些副食品和土特产品的生产旺季，又是秋收还没有开始的农闲季节，商业职工抓紧这个时机，运用去年行之有效的经常收购和突击收购相结合，专业人员收购和组织群众协助收购相结合的经验，开展一个上山收、下乡收、人人收、店店收的群众性采购运动，积极采购农村副业产品和松香、土碱、毛皮、编织品、草苇等土特产品和工业原料。中共青冈县委和各人民公社组织农副产品收购指挥部，从各部门抽调干部，配合商业部门组成一千八百多人的采购队，收购生猪和鸡蛋，全县第三季度的生猪收购计划和全年的鲜蛋收购计划，已提前在9月2日完成。山区尚志县苇河公社组织四千多人的采购队伍，分成采树籽、挖人参、拣蘑菇、打羊草等专业小组，战斗在山野中。全省从8月26日到31日的六天内，共收购猪三万头，平均每天收购五千头，比8月20日以前每天的收购量增加十五倍多，9月1日的收购量更增加到九千一百多头。现在全省已经有青冈、克东等九个县，提前完成了第三季度的生猪收购和外调任务。
    各地商业部门在收购的同时，积极组织城市工业品下乡。兰西县远大公社供销部主任每天挑着担子，把日用工业品送到农民家里，一面供应，一面收购，群众很满意。
