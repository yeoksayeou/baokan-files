Refuting the Fallacy of "Imbalance in National Economic Proportions"
—"Red Flag" Magazine Editorial, Issue 18

In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, were full of spirit, and worked with great enthusiasm, setting off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. Our national economy and cultural and educational undertakings have achieved unprecedented leaps forward.

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 enabled us to successfully complete or overfulfill ahead of schedule some important product output targets, such as grain, coal, and timber, which were originally planned to be achieved by 1962 in the Second Five-Year Plan. It enabled us to gain time in the process of socialist construction and shorten the journey of our country's socialist construction. This is the brilliant victory of the General Line and the great victory of a whole set of policies for developing the national economy formulated by the Party, namely, several "simultaneous developments," commonly known as "walking on two legs."

It is an old habit of the imperialists to viciously slander and attack our great socialist cause. Since last year, they have been particularly fierce in attacking our General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, these three great and vibrant new things, because they understand that what is more beneficial to us is more unfavorable to them. The fact is also true: the things that the Chinese people particularly like, the imperialists always particularly dislike. A small handful of right-leaning opportunists in the country also took the opportunity to attack the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward. One of the main "arguments" they used to attack the General Line and the Great Leap Forward was that our national economy was out of proportion, creating what they called a "state of tension." Actual facts prove that their statement is completely fallacious.

Whether the proportional relationships in the national economy are adapted or imbalanced should be viewed from the main proportional relationships. This is common sense in Marxist economics. According to Marx's theory of reproduction, the most important proportional relationship in the national economy is the proportional relationship between the production of the means of production and the production of consumer goods, and in the proportional relationship of expanded reproduction, the production of the means of production occupies a position of priority growth. Lenin pointed out that Marx's formula on the comparison between the first category and the second category is effective for both socialism and communism. The General Line of socialist construction put forward by our Party, which implements the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, etc., under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, is formulated by creatively applying Marxist principles based on the specific practice of socialist construction in our country. Since heavy industrial products are the main part of the means of production, and agricultural products and light industrial products are the main part consumer goods, the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and the simultaneous development of heavy industry and light industries, under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, comprehensively and profoundly reflects the requirements of the objective law of the proportional relationship between the production of the means of production and the production of consumer goods. Now, let us analyze the proportional relationship of our national economy based on the major proportions of our industrial and agricultural production, heavy and light industrial production, and the corresponding accumulation and consumption.

In 1958, both industrial and agricultural production in our country achieved leap-forward development: the total industrial output value increased by 66% over the previous year, and the total agricultural output value increased by 25%. In the total industrial output value, heavy industry increased by 103% and light industry increased by 34%. Such high growth rates in heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture have never been seen in our country before.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value of our country increased by an average of 18% per year, and the total agricultural output value increased by an average of 4.5% per year; in the total industrial output value, heavy industry increased by an average of 25.4% per year, and light industry increased by an average of 12.8% per year. Comparing the growth rate in 1958 with the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period, industry was 3.7 times higher, agriculture was 5.6 times higher, heavy industry in industry was 4 times higher, and light industry was 2.7 times higher. It can be seen here that, in 1958, whether it was industry or agriculture, heavy industry or light industry, their growth rates far exceeded those of the First Five-Year Plan period. From the perspective of the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, 1958 was able to embody the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture better than the First Five-Year Plan period. From the perspective of the proportional relationship between heavy industry and light industry, the production of heavy industry developed particularly rapidly, and the development of light industry was also very rapid. This also embodies the policy of simultaneous development of heavy industry and light industry under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry.

Let's look at the proportional relationships within heavy industry: Heavy industry production doubled in 1958. Was the proportion within heavy industry coordinated? Did "taking steel as the key link" squeeze out other departments, as the right-leaning opportunists said? The opposite is true. "Taking steel as the key link" did not squeeze out other departments, but rather drove them forward. In this year, the output of heavy industrial products that increased by more than doubled included coal, power generation equipment, power machinery, locomotives, and automobiles. Electricity was originally a relatively weak link in heavy industry, but it also increased by 42% this year, with an absolute increase of 8.2 billion kilowatt-hours; while the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period was only 12.1 billion kilowatt-hours, and the fastest growth in 1956 was only 4.3 billion kilowatt-hours. The output of power generation equipment this year was equivalent to three times that of the previous year, which shows that the power industry is working hard to catch up. It is common for the growth of various heavy industrial products to vary in speed; however, some weak links in our country caused by historical reasons cannot be completely overcome in a short period of time. However, in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, some weak links have undergone significant changes.

The development of heavy industry production in 1958 basically guaranteed the needs of the high-speed growth of capital construction and was also adapted to the expansion of capital construction. In 1958, heavy industry production increased by 103%, and capital construction investment increased by 93%. It can be seen from this that the scale of capital construction in 1958 was not blind and without basis, as some right-leaning opportunists said, but was established on the basis of the development of heavy industry production. Therefore, the proportional relationship between production and construction was basically reasonable.

The distribution of national income between consumption and accumulation centrally reflects the interrelationship between national construction and the people's livelihood. The right-leaning opportunists believe that the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in 1958 was imbalanced and lowered the people's living standards, which is of course nonsense. On the basis of the overall leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, heavy and light industrial production, and the maintenance of a reasonable proportional relationship between the production of the means of production and the production of consumer goods, the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in the national income in 1958 was basically adapted and reasonable. In this year, our accumulation increased very rapidly, which was the result of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and not achieved by lowering the people's living standards, as the right-leaning opportunists said; on the contrary, the people's living standards were greatly improved in this year.

The right-leaning opportunists and some people with wrong views believe that the high-speed development of our national economy will cause overall tension in economic life and will produce a serious imbalance in proportional relationships, which is obviously extremely absurd. The proportional relationships in the national economy in 1958 not only guaranteed the Great Leap Forward of the national economy in that year, but also laid the foundation for the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1959. Without the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the continued leap forward of the national economy this year would be inconceivable.

The main proportional relationships in our national economy are coordinated and normal. However, in some links within various economic sectors, in the production of some products, some individual, local, and temporary disproportional phenomena are inevitable. And these phenomena are easy to overcome. In fact, after adjustments in the first half of this year, the individual, local, and temporary disproportional phenomena in some links have been gradually overcome in the development of production. The right-leaning opportunists only see the trees but not the forest, attacking one point without considering the rest, and exaggerating this individual, local, and temporary disproportional phenomenon into an imbalance in the main proportional relationships of the national economy, which is completely absurd and reflects the panic of the bourgeoisie in the face of the leap-forward development of our country's socialist economic construction.

    驳“国民经济比例关系失调”的谬论
    ——“红旗”杂志第十八期社论
    1958年，在党中央和毛泽东同志所提出的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民解放思想，破除迷信，意气风发，干劲冲天，掀起了社会主义建设大跃进的高潮，我国国民经济和文化教育各项事业都获得了史无前例的飞跃发展。
    1958年的大跃进，使第二个五年计划原来规定在1962年要达到的一些重要产品如粮食、煤炭、原木等产量指标，已经胜利地提前完成或超额完成了。它使我们在社会主义建设过程中争取了时间，缩短了我国建设社会主义的里程。这是总路线的光辉的胜利，是党所制定的几个“同时并举”也就是大家通称的所谓“两条腿走路”一整套发展国民经济方针的伟大胜利。
    帝国主义者向我们的伟大社会主义事业进行恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，是他们的老习惯，去年以来，他们对我们的总路线、大跃进、人民公社这三件伟大的生气勃勃的新事物，攻击得特别厉害，因为他们懂得，对我们更加有利的事物，对他们是更加不利的。事实也正是这样：中国人民特别喜欢的事物，帝国主义者总是特别不喜欢的。国内一小撮右倾机会主义分子也乘机向党的总路线和大跃进进攻。他们攻击总路线、大跃进的主要“论据”之一，是说我们的国民经济比例关系失调了，造成了他们所谓的“紧张状态”。实际情况证明他们的这种说法完全是谬论。
    国民经济中的比例关系是适应还是失调，应该从主要的比例关系来看，这是马克思主义经济学的常识。按照马克思的再生产原理，国民经济中最主要的比例关系，是生产资料生产和消费资料生产两大部类的比例关系，而在扩大再生产的这个比例关系中，生产资料生产占优先增长的地位。列宁指出，马克思关于第一部类和第二部类对比关系的公式，对于社会主义和对于共产主义都是有效的。我们党的社会主义建设总路线所提出的在优先发展重工业的条件下，实行工业和农业并举、重工业和轻工业并举等等一系列几个“同时并举”的发展国民经济的方针，就是根据我国社会主义建设的具体实践，创造性地运用马克思主义原理而制定的。由于重工业产品是生产资料的主要部分，农产品和轻工业产品是消费资料的主要部分，所以在优先发展重工业的条件下，工业和农业并举，重工业和轻工业并举，就是全面地、深刻地反映了生产资料生产和消费资料生产比例关系的客观规律的要求。现在就我国工业和农业生产，重工业和轻工业生产，以及与此相适应的积累和消费等主要比例，来分析我国国民经济的比例关系。
    1958年我国的工农业生产都有飞跃的发展：工业总产值比上年增长66％，农业总产值增长25％。在工业总产值中，重工业增长103％，轻工业增长34％。重工业、轻工业、农业这样高的增长速度都是在我国从来未有过的。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国的工业总产值每年平均增长18％，农业总产值每年平均增长4.5％；在工业总产值中，重工业每年平均增长25.4％，轻工业每年平均增长12.8％。1958年的增长速度同第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长速度比较，工业为三点七倍，农业为五点六倍，工业中重工业为四倍，轻工业为二点七倍。这里可以看到，1958年不论工业或农业，重工业或轻工业，它们的增长速度都远远地超过了第一个五年计划时期。从工业和农业的比例关系来讲，1958年比第一个五年计划期间更能体现工业和农业并举的方针。从重工业和轻工业的比例关系来讲，重工业的生产发展得特别快，轻工业生产的发展也是很快的。这也体现了在优先发展重工业的条件下，重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针。
    再看重工业内部的比例关系：1958年重工业生产翻一番，重工业内部的比例究竟是否协调呢？是否真像右倾机会主义分子所说的“以钢为纲”挤掉了其他部门呢？完全相反。“以钢为纲”不是挤掉了其他部门，而是带动了其他部门。这一年重工业产品产量增加一倍以上的，有煤炭、发电设备、动力机械、机车、汽车等。电力原来是重工业中比较薄弱的环节，这一年也增长了42％，增长的绝对数是八十二亿度；而第一个五年计划期间总共只增长了一百二十一亿度，其中增长最快的1956年也只增长了四十三亿度。这一年发电设备的产量相当于上一年的三倍，这说明电力工业正在努力向前追赶。各种重工业产品增长有快有慢，这是常有的现象；而我国有些由于历史原因造成的薄弱环节，不是在很短时间内可以完全克服的。但是，在1958年大跃进中，一些薄弱环节已经有了显著的改变。
    1958年重工业生产的发展，基本上保证了基本建设高速度增长的需要，同基本建设的扩大也是适应的。1958年重工业生产增长103％，基本建设投资增长93％。从这里可以看出，1958年基本建设规模，不是如某些右倾机会主义分子所说是盲目的、无根据的，而是建立在重工业生产发展的基础上，因而生产和建设的比例关系基本上是合理的。
    国民收入在消费和积累之间的分配，集中地反映了国家建设和人民生活之间的相互关系。右倾机会主义分子认为1958年积累和消费的比例关系失调，降低了人民生活，这当然也是胡说霸道。在以上工农业生产、重轻工业生产全面跃进，和生产资料生产与消费资料生产两大部类保持合理比例关系的基础上，1958年国民收入中积累和消费的比例关系基本上是适应的、合理的。在这一年中，我们的积累增加得很快，这是工农业生产大跃进的结果，而并不像右倾机会主义分子所说的，是由降低人民生活水平而达到的；相反，人民生活水平在这一年有了很大的提高。
    右倾机会主义分子和某些持有错误观点的人认为，我们国民经济高速度发展，就会造成经济生活中的全面紧张，就会产生比例关系的严重失调，显然这是极端荒谬的。1958年国民经济中的比例关系，不仅保证了当年国民经济的大跃进，而且为1959年国民经济的继续跃进建立了基础。如果没有1958年的大跃进，今年国民经济的继续跃进，是不可设想的。
    我国国民经济中主要比例关系是协调的、正常的。但是，在各经济部门内部的某些环节上，某些产品生产上，也不可避免出现某些个别的、局部的、暂时性的比例不协调的现象。而这种现象是很容易克服的。事实上今年上半年经过调整，在某些环节上的个别的、局部的、暂时性的不协调现象，已经在生产的发展中，逐步克服。右倾机会主义分子只见树木，不见森林，攻其一点，不及其余，把这种个别的、局部的、暂时性的不协调现象，夸大为国民经济主要比例关系的失调，是完全荒谬的，是反映了资产阶级在我国社会主义经济建设飞跃发展面前的惊惶失措。
