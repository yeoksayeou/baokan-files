Give It Another Push
Strive for a Yield of 165 Jin of Ginned Cotton Per Mu
Tang Zhida, Secretary of the Chenxiang People's Commune Party Committee, Siyang County, Jiangsu

Some people call cotton the "son of the sun." Indeed, sufficient sunlight plays an important role in the growth of cotton. However, when I see our township's 7,800 mu of cotton, with tall, leafy plants, numerous buds, and large bolls, the first thing I think of is not the sun hanging in the sky, but the People's Commune, the rising sun of the East.

Last year, our township's average yield of ginned cotton was 137 jin per mu, a doubling of production compared to 1957. This was a great leap forward. And this year? The cotton is growing even better than last year. Although there has been a severe drought recently, we are confident that the average yield per mu will still reach 150 jin. We are determined to give it another push, strengthen late-stage management, and strive for 165 jin per mu.

Why can cotton production surpass last year's this year? One of the most important reasons is that we have the People's Commune to uniformly plan production and rationally arrange labor.

There is a big difference between this year's cotton and last year's, which is that growth is generally balanced, and third-class seedlings have been basically eliminated. Last year, the cotton fields were planned separately by each agricultural cooperative. Some cotton was planted in distant fields five or six li away, which was inconvenient to manage; some cotton was planted on shifting sand, which was unsuitable for the soil. This created factors that led to the emergence of third-class seedlings at the time of sowing. In addition, the cotton fields were scattered, management varied, advanced technical measures were not easily promoted in a timely manner, and it was difficult to eliminate third-class seedlings. This year, the situation has completely changed. Because the People's Commune has reasonably adjusted the interspersed fields between brigades, the problem of distant, low-yielding land no longer exists. At the time of cotton sowing, we divided the cotton fields into four areas based on the soil conditions of the entire commune and the production conditions of each brigade, with each area ranging from over 1,000 mu to over 2,000 mu. The land was connected. The commune's tractors can fully play their role, deeply plowing the land, and field management is also more convenient; and it is also conducive to unified leadership and mutual promotion. Now, the commune Party committee is adopting some advanced technical measures in the experimental fields, which will soon be fully promoted in the entire area. At the same time, the cotton fields of the major brigades are adjacent to each other, and the contrast between good and bad is clear, which can stimulate everyone to learn from each other, catch up with each other, and move forward together. Therefore, last year the cotton production of our commune's Agricultural Construction Brigade was more prominent, and other brigades were far behind; while this year, many brigades have cotton similar to that of the Agricultural Construction Brigade, and it is difficult to predict who will be higher.

This year, the labor arrangement for cotton field management is also more reasonable than last year. Last year, most of the cotton fields were managed by male labor; because public canteens and nurseries were established after communization, female labor was liberated, and women now account for more than three-quarters of the personnel managing cotton fields. This not only meets the requirements of fine work in cotton field management, ensuring that cotton production is managed by dedicated and professional personnel; but also draws a large number of male labor into grain production, so that the policy of giving equal importance to grain and cotton can be implemented.

In addition, thanks to the commune, cooperation between major brigades has been strengthened. This year, when blind bugs and bridge worms caused serious damage, some brigades did not have enough sprayers. The commune immediately organized mutual support between brigades, and finally overcame the difficulty of insufficient tools, and timely eliminated the pests in four days. The cooperation between industrial and commercial departments and agricultural production is also closer than in the past. This year, the cotton seedlings were hit by a storm, and it was necessary to rush to replant the seedlings. At that time, the commune's farm tool factory rushed to produce 500 melon hoes in one day and one night, ensuring that the major brigades did not lack transplanting tools; the timely supply of pesticides and fertilizers by the commercial department also played a good role in ensuring increased cotton production.

Our commune has been established for less than a year, and it has already exerted a tremendous force in cotton production. In the future, we must hold the red flag of the commune even higher, so that the cotton of the whole township, illuminated by the brilliance of the commune, will increase production year after year and reap bumper harvests year after year.

    再鼓一把劲
    争取亩产皮棉165斤
    江苏泗阳县城厢公社党委书记　唐志达
    有人把棉花叫做“太阳之子”。的确，充分的阳光对棉花的生长有着重要的作用。但是，当我看到我们全乡七千八百亩株高枝密、蕾多桃大的棉花时，我首先想到的并不是悬挂在天空的太阳，而是人民公社这个东方初升的太阳。
    去年，我们全乡棉花平均亩产皮棉一百三十七斤，比1957年增产一倍，这是一个特大跃进。而今年呢？棉花长得比去年还好，虽然最近一个时期旱象严重，但平均单产仍有把握达到一百五十斤。我们决心再鼓一把劲，加强后期管理，争取亩产一百六十五斤。
    为什么今年棉花能超过去年呢？最重要原因之一是：有了人民公社来统一筹划生产和合理安排劳力。
    今年棉花和去年有个很大的不同，就是生长大体平衡，三类苗基本消灭。去年棉田由各农业社分别规划，有的棉花种在五、六里外的远地上，管理不便；有的棉花种在飞沙土上，土质不宜；这样在播种时就造成了出现三类苗的因素。再加棉田分布零散，管理好坏不一，先进技术措施不易及时推广，消灭三类苗也较困难。而今年，情况完全改变了。由于人民公社合理调整了大队间的插花田，远地低产问题已不存在。在棉花播种时，我们根据全社土质条件和各大队生产情况，把棉田划成四个片，每片一千多亩到二千多亩，土地连片。公社的拖拉机可充分发挥作用，深翻土地，田间管理也较方便；而且还有利于统一领导和互相促进。现在，公社党委在试验田采用了一些先进技术措施，很快就能在整片全面推广。同时，各大队棉田接壤，好坏对比分明，能刺激大家相互学习，彼此追赶，共同向前。因此，去年我们公社农建大队的棉花生产较突出，其它大队相差较远；而今年已有不少大队的棉花和农建大队相仿，谁高谁低还难预断。
    今年，棉田管理的劳力安排也比去年合理了。去年管理棉田的大部是男劳力；由于公社化后建立了公共食堂、托儿所，妇女劳力得到了解放，今年管理棉田人员中妇女已占四分之三以上。这不但适合棉田管理需工精细的要求，保证棉花生产有专人专业负责管理；而且抽出大批男劳力投入粮食生产，使粮棉并举方针能贯彻执行。
    此外，由于有了公社，各大队间协作加强了。在今年盲椿象、造桥虫为害严重时，一部分大队喷雾器不够用，公社马上组织大队间的相互支援，终于克服了工具不足的困难，四天内及时消灭虫害。工业部门和商业部门对农业生产的配合也比过去紧密了。今年棉花苗期受暴风袭击，需要突击补苗。当时公社农具厂在一天一夜赶制五百把瓜铲，保证各大队不缺移苗工具；商业部门对农药肥料的及时供应，也对保证棉花增产起了良好作用。
    我们公社成立不到一年，已在棉花生产中发挥了巨大威力。今后我们一定要把公社红旗举得更高，使全乡棉花在公社光芒照耀下，年年增产，岁岁丰收。
