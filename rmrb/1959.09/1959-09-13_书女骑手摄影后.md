    After the Photograph of the Bookish Female Riders
    Lin Chen
    The People's Daily of August 24th on page six carried two pictures, each with a tall steed, beside which stood a strong girl. The one in the left picture, with a sweet smile, holding the reins in her left hand and stroking the horse's mane with her right, was captioned "Bai Yangzhu and her Steed"; the one in the right picture, with a round face and pigtails, wearing a collared shirt, holding the reins in her right hand, was captioned "Shi Yuxian and her Steed."

    From the pictures and titles, we cannot tell that these are two minority girls; only by reading the reporter's article under the pictures do we learn that Bai Yangzhu is of the Buyi ethnic group and Shi Yuxian is of the Shui ethnic group, and that they are both racehorse athletes from Guizhou Province participating in the First National Games.

    It is said that Guizhou has produced fine horses since ancient times. Near Guiyang, there is a place where several ethnic minorities live together called Yanglongsi (Nurturing Dragon Temple), which is named after producing "dragon steeds." In Wang Shixing's "Qian Zhi" (Gazetteer of Guizhou) of the Ming Dynasty, there is the following passage: "Yanglongkeng Magistrate Department has a pit between two mountains, which is deep and bottomless, seemingly with a dragon beneath it. In springtime, when stallions and mares roam, the Yi people plant willows on the edge of the pit and tie a mare to it; soon after, the clouds and mists become dim, as if something sinuous is mating with the mare, and the offspring will surely be a dragon steed." Before "Qian Zhi," Song Lian, a famous writer of the early Ming Dynasty, also wrote a "Dragon Horse Eulogy" with the same account. This is, of course, just a legend, beautiful though it is, but not to be believed. In fact, during the long and dark years of the past, the laboring people of the Yi and other ethnic minorities in Guizhou Province could not even easily own an ox for plowing, let alone any dragon steed; they were too busy making a living, and naturally could not talk about activities like horse racing. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, for many years, few ethnic minorities raised horses, and the custom of horse racing gradually declined. I have never seen any ethnic minority female riders.

    However, liberation has brought unprecedented changes to the lives of the ethnic minorities in Guizhou. With the improvement and betterment of their political and economic lives, their horse racing activities have also achieved a great leap forward. In the short span of a few years after liberation, Sandu Shui Autonomous County alone had sixteen horse racing slopes, "with thousands of fine horses and tens of thousands of people participating in each race." Two girls from poor peasant families have truly acquired their own dragon steeds and, in a very short time, have mastered considerable horsemanship. "Currently, Bai Yangzhu's time in the women's 1,000-meter race has reached one minute and ten seconds, and Shi Yuxian's women's high-obstacle race has achieved a jump over one meter and forty-five centimeters. Both of them have surpassed the highest results in the same events at the Second National Games of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Last year and this year, they showed their skills in the provincial and autonomous prefecture horse racing events; and now, they have been honorably selected as representatives to participate in the National Games!

    In the past, I have also seen Guizhou minority girls in paintings like "One Hundred Miao Pictures," which were depicted as novel and strange specimens. There were often great distortions in their appearance, costumes, and explanatory texts. Now, these two girls are appearing in the Party Central Committee's newspaper published in the capital as athletes of the National Games. This is probably something that even they themselves had never imagined. These, though small, are two pictures from which we can see the happy life of the ethnic minorities in Guizhou after liberation. The Party's ethnic policies, like the sun shining on all things and the spring rain nourishing all plants, benefit everyone in the ethnic minorities in Guizhou and across the country. The younger generation is being cultivated into specialists in various fields under this sunshine and rain. These two girls becoming female riders is just one example.

    The horse racing and polo competitions of the First National Games are being held in Hohhot. My happy Buyi and Shui girls, I wish you excellent results in the competition, and I hope that through this competition, you will gain experience and continuously improve your horsemanship in the future!

    书女骑手摄影后
    林辰
    8月24日人民日报第六版载有两幅图片，每幅上都有一匹高头骏马，旁边各站着一位健壮的姑娘，左图的一位，笑容可掬，左手执缰，右手抚马鬣，标题是“白扬祝和她的骏马”；右图的一位，圆脸双辫，穿翻领衬衣，右手执缰，标题是“石玉仙和她的骏马”。
    从图片和标题上，我们看不出这是两位少数民族姑娘；一看图下刊载的记者所写的文章，才知道白扬祝是布依族，石玉仙是水族，她们都是贵州省参加第一届全国运动会的赛马选手。
    据传贵州很早以前就出产良马。贵阳附近有一个少数民族杂居的地方叫养龙司，便是以产“龙驹”而得名。明王士性所著“黔志”里有这样一则：“养龙坑长官司，有坑在两山之间，停蓄渊深，似有蛟龙在其下。当春时腾驹游牝，彝人插柳于坑畔，取牝马系之；已而云雾晦暝，类有物蜒蜿与马接者，其生必龙驹。”在“黔志”之前，明初著名文学家宋濂所著的“龙马赞”里，也有相同的记载。这自然只是一个传说，虽很美丽，但未可信。事实上，在过去漫长的黑暗岁月中，贵州彝族等少数民族劳动人民，连有一头耕牛也不容易，哪里还会有什么龙驹；他们谋生不暇，自然更谈不到赛马之类的活动。因此，在我所知道的范围内，多少年来，少数民族饲养马匹的不多，赛马之风日趋衰歇，我从不曾见过什么少数民族女骑手。
    然而，解放给贵州少数民族的生活带来了过去数千年来从未有过的变化，随着政治、经济生活的提高和改善，他们的赛马活动也获得了飞跃的发展。在解放后短短数年间，仅三都水族自治县就有赛马坡十六个，“每次赛马总有上千匹良马和成万人参加”。两个出生贫苦农民家庭的女孩子，也真正有了自己的龙驹，在很短时间内，便掌握了相当高的驭马技术，“目前，白扬祝的女子一千米赛马成绩已达到一分十秒，石玉仙的女子高障碍赛马，也取得跳过一米四十五的成绩。两人都超过了中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会中同项比赛的最高成绩”。去年和今年，她们在全省和全自治州赛马大会上，曾经大显身手；而现在，她们又光荣地被选为参加全国运动会的代表了！
    过去，我也曾在什么“百苗图”一类的画幅上看到过贵州少数民族姑娘，那是作为新奇、怪异的标本被描画下来的，在形貌、服饰和说明文字上，往往有很大的歪曲。现在，这两位姑娘，竟然以全国运动会选手的姿态，出现在首都出版的党中央主办的报纸上，这恐怕是连她们自己也从未想到过的事吧，这虽是小小的两幅图片，但我们可以从它看到解放后贵州少数民族的幸福生活。党的民族政策，如阳光之普照万物，春雨之滋润百卉，贵州和全国各地少数民族中的每一个人，无不蒙受其恩泽；年轻的一代，更在这阳光雨露下被培育成各方面的专材。这两位姑娘之成为女骑手，只不过是其中的一个例子。
    第一届全运会的赛马和马球竞赛正在呼和浩特举行，你幸福的布依族和水族的姑娘，我祝你们在竞赛中取得优异的成绩，并希望你们通过这次竞赛，吸取经验，在今后不断地把自己的马术提高起来！
