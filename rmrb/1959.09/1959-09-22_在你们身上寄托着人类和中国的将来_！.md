    "The Future of Humanity and China Rests on You!"
    By Xu Guangping
    On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of our nation, I want to sing a hymn of praise to our beloved People's Liberation Army.
    In 1936, shortly after the Red Army arrived in northern Shaanxi after the Long March, in order to save the motherland, it immediately crossed the Yellow River eastward to resist the Japanese invaders. This heroic action was warmly supported by the broad masses of people throughout the country. Mr. Lu Xun once sent a letter from Shanghai to congratulate the Red Army, saying, "The future of humanity and China rests on you!" (Quote from the 1947 Taihang edition of "Xinhua Daily").
    Lu Xun said this based on a profound historical understanding, a truth he realized from his long life experience. In the late Qing Dynasty, with internal and external troubles, countless incidents of national humiliation and ceding of sovereign rights occurred. The young patriot Lu Xun once translated "The Soul of Sparta" with impassioned feelings, hoping to awaken the people and fight to the death against foreign invaders. Long before the Great Revolution, Lu Xun clearly recognized that the quickest way to achieve revolutionary results was through "fire and sword" (see "Two Places Book"). On April 8, 1927, when giving a lecture at the Whampoa Military Academy, he said that a poem would not scare away the reactionaries, but a cannon would blow them away (see "E Ji Ji"). He called on ambitious young people to go to the battlefield. However, later, the Kuomintang reactionaries shamelessly betrayed the revolution, followed by the bloody "purification" and then the brutal encirclement and suppression. In order to cooperate with the Red Army's heroic struggle against "encirclement and suppression," Lu Xun not only translated "The Nineteen," proofread and published "The Iron Stream," but also planned to write a novel reflecting the Red Army's struggle to educate the people and boost morale (later, because he felt that he had not personally experienced this struggle and was afraid that he would not write it deeply enough, he put it aside). After the Japanese imperialists invaded Northeast China in 1931, they launched the "January 28th" war of aggression in Shanghai. Lu Xun personally tasted the fire of foreign invaders on his own land. The entire Chinese nation was in a critical situation.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries not only did not resist the Japanese invaders but also tried every means to prevent the Red Army from going north to resist Japan. The heroic Red Army, braving the bombing of planes in the sky, breaking through the encirclement and interception of enemy troops on the ground, enduring cold and hunger, climbing over snow-capped mountains and grasslands, spending twelve months, marching more than 20,000 miles, crossing the land of eleven provinces, and experiencing countless difficulties and hardships, finally victoriously arrived in northern Shaanxi. And after arriving, it immediately went to the front line and assumed the great mission of resisting Japan. Lu Xun foresaw the boundless hope and said, "The future of humanity and China rests on you!" This praise represented the sincere gratitude and heartfelt wishes of the Chinese people for the revolutionary actions led by the Party.
    Lu Xun's hope was not in vain. Thirteen years after his death, our motherland has undergone a fundamental change. October 1, 1949, is a day that every Chinese person and our children and grandchildren will never forget. On that day, when I heard Chairman Mao solemnly announce the founding of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, I was extremely excited. No matter how I tried to restrain myself, the feelings of gratitude and excitement caused joyful tears to well up in my eyes. I thought at the time: Our beloved people's soldiers! You have devoted so much energy and shed so much blood in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation in exchange for our bright and happy today, so that the long-oppressed Chinese people can hold their heads high on today's world stage!
    Chairman Mao once pointed out: The Long March is a seed sower, "It scattered many seeds in eleven provinces, which sprouted, grew leaves, blossomed, and bore fruit, and there will be harvests in the future" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," p. 145). Fourteen years later, on the land of the motherland, except for Taiwan, the seeds brought by the Long March have grown into huge fruits, and the entire country has become a large garden full of fruitful results and competing flowers. And these revolutionary seeds were preciously preserved by the people's army led by the Party from the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," sown, cultivated, and cared for to grow up. Now it has been ten years since the founding of the country. There is an ancient Chinese poem that says: "One thinks of one's relatives all the more on festive occasions." Yes, whenever we celebrate the National Day with jubilation and enthusiasm, I cannot help but think of the soldiers cultivated and educated by the Party: It was you who, wearing thin military uniforms, drove away the Japanese invaders with millet and rifles on the vast and cold land; it was you who, with inferior equipment, completely defeated millions of Kuomintang troops equipped with American weapons; it was you who, on the land of Korea, held back the invading troops of the world's number one imperialist, armed to the teeth, with a handful of fried noodles and a handful of white snow, cutting off their pig snouts that wanted to stretch into our motherland's garden, helping the Korean people, and safeguarding world peace; it is you who, on the long defense line, day and night, rain or shine, steadfastly stick to your posts, vigilantly watching the conspiracies of imperialism and all reactionaries. In these earth-shaking struggles, countless fascinating heroic deeds have emerged: the five warriors of Langya Mountain, in order to cover the retreating troops, collectively jumped off the cliff with a spirit that shook the heavens and moved the gods when they ran out of ammunition and food; Comrade Dong Cunrui, in order to blow up a bridge occupied by the enemy, held a bomb and perished together with the enemy; Comrade Huang Jiguang, in order to cover the attack of his troops, blocked the enemy's gun with his chest full of blood; Comrade An Yemin, in the battle of shelling Kinmen, after 70% of his body was burned to the third degree, was still able to persevere in the battle for more than 40 minutes and finally achieved the final victory. Similar heroic deeds worthy of praise, whether in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and now in the various troops guarding the defense line, are countless and endless. In recent years, when I visited the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea and the People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang, I personally saw so many heroes and personally stroked so many simple and kind soldiers. You will always be the Party's most loyal children, always follow the Party; you will always be the people's most beloved soldiers, always protect the interests of the people. You are the most beloved people.
    Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army: Your victory is the enemy's defeat. When we happily celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country and build the country at a rapidly developing speed, some people in the world are very unhappy! American imperialism and all reactionaries are still using various opportunities and methods to provoke us, trying to undermine our construction and prevent our progress. Therefore, you still shoulder arduous and glorious tasks. The growth, strengthening, and consolidation of our motherland are a powerful guarantee for world peace and human progress. Here, let me continue to quote Lu Xun's words to wish you continued progress in the past ten years:
    "The future of humanity and China rests on you!"

### “在你们身上寄托着人类和中国的将来”！

专栏：十年颂歌

    “在你们身上寄托着人类和中国的将来”！
    许广平
    在庆祝建国十周年的时候，我要为我们可爱的人民解放军唱一支赞歌。
    1936年红军在长征到达陕北之后不久，为了拯救祖国，立即东渡黄河抗日讨敌。这一英勇行动，得到了全国广大人民的热烈拥护。鲁迅先生曾经从上海辗转发出一封信庆贺红军，说：“在你们身上寄托着人类和中国的将来”（引文见1947年太行版“新华日报”）。
    鲁迅说这句话是有深刻的历史根据的，是他从长期的生活经历中体会出来的一条真理。在清朝末年，内忧外患，招来了无数的丧权辱国事件，青年爱国者鲁迅曾经以激昂慷慨的心情，翻译过“斯巴达之魂”，想以此来唤起人民，同外国侵略者作殊死的战斗。远在大革命以前，鲁迅就明确地认识到革命收效最快的是“火与剑”（见“两地书”）。在1927年4月8日，到黄埔军官学校讲演的时候，他就说一首诗吓不走反动派，一炮就把他轰走了（见“而已集”），他号召有志气的青年都应当走到战场上去。可是后来国民党反动派无耻地叛变了革命，血腥的“清党”之后，又继之以惨酷的围剿。为了配合红军英勇的反“围剿”斗争，鲁迅不但翻译了“毁灭”，校对出版了“铁流”，并且打算自己也写一部反映红军斗争的小说，用以教育人民，鼓舞士气（后来因为感到自己没有亲身经历过这一斗争，怕写得不够深刻而故此搁笔）。1931年，日本帝国主义侵占了东北以后，接着又在上海发动“一二八”侵略战争，鲁迅亲身在自己的国土上尝到了外国侵略者的炮火。整个中华民族处于危急关头。
    国民党反动派不但不抵抗日寇的侵略，反而想尽方法阻止红军北上抗日。英勇的红军，冲过天空飞机的轰炸，击破地面敌军的围截，忍着寒冷饥饿，爬过雪山草地，费时一十二月，长驱二万余里，跨过十一个省的土地，历尽了数不尽的艰难困苦，终于胜利地到达了陕北。并且在到达之后，立即开赴前线，负起抗日的伟大使命。鲁迅预见到充满着无限的希望说：“在你们身上寄托着人类和中国的将来”！这个歌颂，代表着全中国人民对党所领导的革命行动发出的由衷的感激和衷心的祝愿。
    鲁迅的希望并没有落空。在他逝世十三年之后，我们的祖国已经起了一个根本的变化。1949年10月1日，这是每一个中国人民以及我们的子子孙孙，都是永世不可忘记的日子。那一天，当我在天安门上听见毛主席庄严地宣布中华人民共和国开国公告的时候，我激动不已，无论怎样抑制，感激和兴奋的心情，不由得欢喜的泪花涌到了我的眼边。我当时想：我们可爱的人民战士啊！你们在八年抗日战争和三年解放战争当中，不知付出了多少精力，抛洒了多少热血，才换来了我们今天的光明、幸福，才使久受压抑的中国人民能在今天的世界舞台上扬眉吐气！
    毛主席曾经指出：长征是播种机，“它散布了许多种子在十一个省内，发芽、长叶、开花、结果，将来是会有收获的”（“毛泽东选集”第一四五页）。在十四年之后，祖国的大地上，除了台湾而外，长征带来的种子，已经长出了硕大的果实，整个国家已经成了果实累累、群芳斗艳的大花园了。而这些革命的种子，是由党所领导的人民军队从敌人的“围剿”中珍贵保存，散播下去，培养起来，看护长大的。现在建国已十周年了。中国有一句古诗说：“每逢佳节倍思亲”，是的，每当万众欢腾、热烈庆祝国庆佳节的时候，我不由得就会想起党培养教育出来的子弟兵：是你们穿着单薄的军装，在严寒辽阔的国土上用小米加步枪赶走了日本侵略者；是你们用劣势的装备，彻底打垮了由美国武器装备起来的几百万国民党军队；是你们在朝鲜的国土上，一把炒面、一把白雪地顶住了武装到牙齿的世界第一号帝国主义的侵略军队，切断了它们想伸进我们祖国花园的猪嘴，帮助了朝鲜人民，卫护了世界和平；是你们在漫长的国防线上，日日夜夜，风雨无阻，目不转睛的在坚守着岗位，警惕的注视着帝国主义和一切反动派的阴谋活动。在这些翻天复地的斗争中，出现了无数令人神往的英雄事迹：狼牙山上五壮士为了掩护撤退部队，在弹尽道绝的时候，以惊天地、泣鬼神的精神集体投崖；董存瑞同志为了炸毁敌人盘踞的一道桥梁，手托炸药包和敌人同归于尽；黄继光同志为了掩护自己部队的进攻用自己满腔热血的胸膛，堵住了敌人的枪眼；安业民同志在炮击金门的战斗中，自己全身70％以上的烧伤达到三度以后，犹能坚持四十多分钟的战斗，终于取得了最后胜利。类似这些可歌可泣的英雄事迹，无论抗日战争，解放战争，抗美援朝战争以及现在守卫在国防线上的各个部队当中，都是数不完，说不尽的。几年来，我曾经在朝鲜慰问人民志愿军和在新疆慰问人民解放军的时候，就亲眼看到过这许许多多英雄，亲手抚摩过这许许多多淳朴可亲的战士。你们，永远是党的最忠实的儿女，永远跟着党走；你们，永远是人民的最亲爱的子弟兵，永远保卫着人民的利益。你们，是人民的最可爱的人。
    亲爱的人民解放军同志们：你们的胜利，就是敌人的失败。当我们兴高采烈地庆祝建国十周年，以飞跃发展的速度来建设国家的时候，世界上却有些人大为不高兴！美帝国主义和一切反动派现在还在利用各种机会和方法向我们挑衅，企图破坏我们的建设，阻止我们的前进。因此，在你们身上，还担负着艰巨而又光荣的任务。我们祖国的成长、壮大和巩固，就是世界和平和人类进步的有力保证。在这里让我继续引用鲁迅的那句话，来祝愿十年来你们继续不断的前进：
    “在你们身上，寄托着人类和中国的将来！”
