Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, September 2nd: During the period when the Fujian coast was hit by a typhoon, the three services of the frontline troops in Fujian went all out to rush to rescue and provide disaster relief, which was warmly praised by the people.

    After the typhoon warning was issued, the three services of the frontline troops carried out emergency mobilization. Lieutenant General Zhang Yixiang, Major General Zhou Wenzai and other commanders guarded the telephone day and night, directing the troops to prevent typhoons and provide disaster relief. The command organizations of various troops were changed into typhoon prevention headquarters, and leading cadres were sent to participate in the local prefectural and county party committees' typhoon prevention command posts. A large number of communication equipment was transferred to ensure communication and liaison for the local party committees' typhoon prevention command. Garrisons in Fuzhou, Lianjiang, Fuqing, Changle, Putian and other places also dispatched hundreds of vehicles to rescue materials. Organs, companies, and hospitals also organized rescue teams and ambulance groups to be dispatched at any time to rescue disaster victims. In order to help fishermen return to port in time to avoid the typhoon, a naval unit dispatched dozens of ships on August 28th and 29th, searching the sea area of more than 180 nautical miles from the Beiyu Islands in Xiapu County in the north to the Yuandi Island in Dongshan County in the south. On the Dasha Island at the Jiulong River estuary in Haicheng County, more than 20,000 people live. The terrain there is low, and when encountering strong winds and high tides, floods will inundate it. A naval unit dispatched ten landing craft to brave the wind and waves and relocate the masses to a safe area. Garrisons in Fuzhou, Putian, Jinjiang and other places also vacated barracks to accommodate the masses who had been moved from dangerous areas.

    On the afternoon of the 29th, the wind along the coast gradually strengthened. The forward and island garrison troops immediately organized the masses to transfer to solid fortifications and barracks to avoid the wind, avoiding casualties. At 6 p.m. that evening, the wind and waves south of the Minjiang River estuary increased. The seawalls along the Tantou, Meihua, and Zhanggang lines were in danger. Upon hearing the news, the local garrison immediately organized six to seven hundred officers and soldiers to rush to repair the dikes, fighting the wind and rain for sixteen hours. Troops also participated in the defense of the famous Tong'an Tingxi Reservoir and the Fuzhou "August 1st" Reservoir in Fujian Province. When the typhoon hit Fuzhou, officers and soldiers stationed in Fuzhou braved the wind and rain to protect the safety of people's lives and property.

    After overcoming the typhoon, troops stationed in coastal areas such as Hui'an, Xianyou, and Putian assisted local party and government departments in carrying out various follow-up work, helping the government resettle disaster victims and solving their temporary food and accommodation problems. At present, garrisons in various places are working hard under the leadership of local party committees to prevent rain and floods, and to ensure the final victory in the fight against disasters.

    那里有灾那里就有子弟兵
    福建前线三军奋起抢救台灾
    据新华社福建前线2日电　在福建沿海遭受台风袭击期间，福建前线陆海空三军全力以赴，抢险救灾，受到人民群众的热烈赞扬。
    当台风警报发出以后，前线三军都进行了紧急动员。张翼翔中将、周文在少将等指挥员都夜以继日地守卫在电话机旁，指挥部队防风抢险。各部队的指挥机构都改成了防风指挥部，并派出领导干部参加当地地委、县委的防风指挥所，并调出大批通讯器材，保证地方党委防风指挥的通讯联络。福州、连江、福清、长乐、莆田等地驻军，还派出几百辆汽车抢救物资。机关、连队、医院也都组织了抢救队、救护组，随时出动抢救灾民。为了帮助渔民及时返港避风，海军某部在8月28日和29日，派出几十艘舰艇，寻遍了北自霞浦县的北礵列岛，南至东山县的元弟岛，长达一百八十多浬的海域。海澄县九龙江口的大沙洲上，居住二万多人，那里地势低，遇上大风大潮就洪水漫卷，海军某部派出十条登陆艇，乘风破浪把群众迁移往安全地带。福州、莆田、晋江等地驻军还腾出营房安顿从危险区搬出的群众。
    29日下午，沿海风力逐渐加强，前沿与守岛部队立即组织群众转入坚固的工事和营房内避风，避免了伤亡。当晚六时，闽江口以南风浪加大，潭头、梅花、漳港一线的海堤处在危险之中，当地驻军闻讯后，立即组织六、七百官兵上堤抢修，一直和风雨搏斗了十六个小时。福建省著名的同安汀溪水库、福州“八一”水库等，都有部队参加防守，台风袭击福州时，驻在福州的部队官兵，顶风冒雨保卫人民生命财产安全。
    战胜了台风之后，驻惠安、仙游、莆田等沿海地区的部队，又协助地方党政部门做各种善后工作，帮助政府安置受灾群众，给他们解决临时食宿问题。目前，各地驻军正在当地地方党委领导下，大抓抗雨防洪工作，保证夺得抗灾战斗的最后胜利。
