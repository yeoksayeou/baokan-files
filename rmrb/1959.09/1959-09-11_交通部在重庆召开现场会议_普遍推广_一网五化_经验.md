Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 9th: The Ministry of Communications recently held an on-site conference on short-distance transportation in Chongqing. Based on the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party regarding carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, it was decided to launch a vigorous mass movement for short-distance transportation after the autumn harvest. The conference called on all localities to universally promote the "One Network, Five Transformations" experience (i.e., vehicle-ization, shipping-ization, rail-ization, cable car-ization, and chute-ization, forming a short-distance transportation network), which is the most effective way to solve short-distance transportation problems, in order to adapt to the new upsurge in the national economy after the autumn harvest, as well as the extremely heavy material transportation brought about by grain transfer and the peak market season, and to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's national transportation plan.

The representatives attending the conference focused on visiting the on-site of "One Network, Five Transformations" in Jiangbei County, Sichuan Province, and exchanged experiences in short-distance transportation from Sichuan Province and many provinces and cities across the country.

Currently, short-distance transportation has become a weak link on the transportation front. Therefore, the conference believes that rapidly launching a mass movement for short-distance transportation and vigorously promoting the "One Network, Five Transformations" experience is a decisive key. All localities should adapt to local conditions, comprehensively utilize various simple transportation methods, and fully utilize the power of civilian transportation tools to form a short-distance transportation network, so as to ensure the completion of the ever-increasing short-distance transportation tasks.

Regarding how to implement the Central Committee's resolutions and effectively carry out the mass movement for short-distance transportation, the conference, after research, unanimously agreed that the following work must be done well: (1) Organize forces well. First, consolidate and improve the professional transportation teams that have already been organized by the people's communes, production teams, and factories and mines. Those that have not yet been organized or are insufficiently organized should quickly organize or replenish the professional transportation teams. At the same time, vigorously organize sideline transportation teams and mobilize rural sideline vehicles and ships to participate in transportation whenever there is slack time in farming. The labor force required for loading, unloading, and handling at ports and stations, as well as for road maintenance, road repair, river regulation, and transportation at small coal mines, ore mines, timber and other production sites, should also be planned comprehensively. (2) Strengthen the administrative management and unified command of transportation. In terms of unified planning, efforts should be made to understand the sources of goods, loading and unloading capacity, transportation routes, and transportation capacity, and to balance the amount of transportation and transportation capacity, implementing fixed points, fixed lines, fixed times, fixed tasks, fixed leadership, and fixed transportation capacity. Regarding freight rates, it is necessary to ensure the reasonable income of the masses and also prevent excessively high freight rates in individual areas. The distribution of income should implement the principle of payment according to labor and more pay for more work, correctly handle the relationship between the collective and the individual, and implement a system of over-quota rewards to encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses. It is necessary to strengthen transportation organization, strengthen on-site command, rationally use tools, equipment, and labor, ensure safety and quality, and prevent waste. (3) Carry out technological innovation and improve transportation conditions. Depending on the circumstances in each locality, the masses should be actively organized in this mass movement to promote various mature experiences exchanged at this on-site conference, especially the "One Network, Five Transformations" experience, and build a short-distance transportation network. All localities should seize the opportunity to repair highways damaged by floods and carry out improvement projects such as road and waterway maintenance and dredging. It is also necessary to seize the opportunity to build roads in areas where roads are lacking. At the same time, existing tools should be repaired and new tools should be manufactured as necessary. (4) Strengthen political and ideological work and life management and supply work. The accommodation, food, medical care, and hygiene of transportation personnel, as well as the fodder for livestock, should be properly arranged.

The conference pointed out that the completion of the national transportation plan in the first half of this year was good, and the broad masses of workers were also active and hardworking. However, some cadres have right-leaning ideas. For example, some people have insufficient understanding of the current situation of continued leap forward in the national economy and the heavy tasks brought to transportation by the upsurge of the national movement to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, they lack preparation for how to carry out the mass movement for short-distance transportation, and have not considered and arranged well the quantity of materials to be transported locally and the organization of civilian transportation tools. Some people have failed to effectively implement the policy of walking on two legs in short-distance transportation, believing in and waiting for cars and ships, and are unwilling to actively promote the "One Network, Five Transformations" and other experiences. Some people encounter some difficulties in short-distance transportation work, showing insufficient enthusiasm, fear of difficulty, grumbling, and passively waiting, only reaching out to the higher levels for tools and materials, and not fully relying on the masses to leverage all civilian transportation potential. The conference seriously criticized these manifestations of right-leaning ideas and unified thinking. The representatives unanimously stated in their speeches that they would resolutely and conscientiously implement the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and quickly launch a mass upsurge in short-distance transportation nationwide.

    交通部在重庆召开现场会议
    普遍推广“一网五化”经验
    据新华社重庆9日电　交通部最近在重庆召开了短途运输现场会议，根据党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议，决定在秋后开展一个轰轰烈烈的短途运输群众运动。会议要求各地普遍推广解决短途运输最有效的“一网五化”（即车子化、船运化、轨道化、索道化和溜槽化，组成一个短途运输网）的经验，以适应秋后国民经济的新高涨，以及粮食调运和市场旺季带来的极为繁重的物资运输，保证超额完成今年全国运输计划。
    参加会议的代表，着重参观了四川省江北县“一网五化”的现场，交流了四川省和全国许多省市短途运输的经验。
    目前，短途运输已成为运输战线上的一个薄弱环节，因此，会议认为迅速开展一个短途运输的群众运动，大力推广“一网五化”的经验，是一个决定性的关键。各地应当因地制宜、综合利用各种简易的运输方式，充分发挥民间运输工具的力量，组成一个短途运输网，以保证完成不断增长的短途运输任务。
    对于如何贯彻中央的决议，很好地开展短途运输的群众运动，会议经过研究，一致认为必须做好以下工作：（一）组织好力量。首先把人民公社、生产队和厂矿已经组织起来的专业运输队，加以巩固提高，还没有组织或组织不够的，应当迅速把专业运输队组织或充实起来。同时，要大力组织副业运输队，动员农村副业车船，随时抓紧农闲空隙参加运输。关于港口、车站的装卸搬运和养路、修路、整治河道，以及小窑煤、矿石、木材等生产现场的运输所需的劳动力，也要统筹安排。（二）加强运输的行政管理和统一指挥。在统一计划方面，要做到对货源、装卸能力、运输线路、运输能力都能摸底，做好运量和运力的平衡工作，实行定点、定线、定时间、定任务、定领导、定运力。关于运价，既要保证群众的合理收入，也要防止个别地区运价过高的现象。收益分配要贯彻按劳付酬、多劳多得的原则，正确处理集体与个人的关系，并且实行超额奖励制度，以鼓励广大群众的积极性。要加强运输组织工作，加强现场指挥，合理使用工具设备和劳动力，保证安全和质量，防止浪费。（三）开展技术革新，改善交通条件。应当根据各地情况，在这次群众运动中积极组织群众力量，推广这次现场会议交流的各种成熟经验，特别是“一网五化”的经验，建设短途运输网。各地应当抓紧时机，修好被洪水冲毁的公路，并且进行道路和航道的养护、疏浚等改善工程；对于缺少道路的地方，还须抓紧修建。同时加紧修理现有工具，制造必要的新工具。（四）加强政治思想工作和生活管理供应工作。运输人员的住、食和医药卫生，以及牲畜的草料等，都应当妥善安排。
    会议指出，今年上半年全国的运输计划完成情况是良好的，广大职工也是积极努力的。但是，部分干部存在着右倾思想，如有些人对于当前国民经济继续跃进的形势，对于全国增产节约运动高潮给运输带来的繁重任务，认识不足。因此，对如何开展短途运输的群众运动缺乏准备，对当地需要运输的物资数量和组织民间运输工具，都没有很好考虑和安排。有的人对短途运输坚持两条腿走路的方针贯彻不力，迷信和等待汽车、轮船，不愿积极推广“一网五化”等经验。有些人在短途运输工作中遇到一些困难，表现干劲不足、畏难埋怨、消极等待，只伸手向上面要工具要材料，不去充分依靠群众，发挥民间一切运输潜力。会议对这些右倾思想的表现认真进行了批判，统一了思想。代表们在发言中一致表示，要坚决认真地贯彻党的八届八中全会的号召，迅速在全国范围内掀起一个群众性的短途运输高潮。
