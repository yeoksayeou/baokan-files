Soviet "Izvestia" Editor-in-Chief Adzhubei Reports
American People Warmly Welcome Khrushchev

    This newspaper reports Soviet "Izvestia" published on September 22nd an article written by its editor-in-chief, Adzhubei, en route from Los Angeles to San Francisco, titled "The Passionate Warrior," excerpts of which are translated below:

    Americans are passionate, outgoing, and interested in everything. In a good way, they are often like big children, very straightforward and lively. They quickly get to know others and begin to speak frankly. They are susceptible to various "fads," one moment it's hula hoops, the next it's a succession of movie stars who often "burn out" in less than a season, then new car seat cushions, new cigarette filters, razor attachments, women's socks with red or blue heels. This goes on year after year, month after month, without end. Advertising has a great future.

    Probably, some people appoint themselves as the standard for measuring the social interests of the average American, claiming to be able to most accurately interpret the views, emotions, thoughts, and hopes of the average American. Some of them have estimated that the arrival of the Soviet guests would not greatly disturb ordinary Americans, who would only see it as a sensational news item. Once, Khrushchev spoke very vividly and accurately on this point, saying: "Some people hope that my visit to the United States will only provide an opportunity for people to see a real, one hundred percent Bolshevik at banquets and receptions."

    However, do the American people only have the right to be interested in trivial matters? Is it possible to believe that the great American people (who completed the technological revolution, invented mass production assembly lines, built beautiful cities, and gave the world Chaplin's films and Robeson's songs) can only be confined to hula hoops and new cigarette filters?

    Perhaps this view has some basis. The world of the average American has been isolated from the thoughts and feelings of people in other worlds and continents for a long time. For a long time, the United States was considered a place that could not be harmed. Wars broke out thousands of kilometers away from the United States, burning down cities and villages in other countries. Americans often associate hunger and destruction with the various "support teams" that wealthy America sends to these distant suffering areas in their imaginations.

    I came to the United States a few years ago and traveled almost all over the country. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that I now feel that in just a few years (and this is what I want to emphasize), the mood of the American people has undergone tremendous changes. There is no need to go to our Soviet Union, or to the United States or any other country to prove that the people of this country or that country love peace. There are no barbaric nations, and there are no aggressive nations.

    There have been many changes in science and technology in the past four years. In 1955, Americans still looked at our Soviet journalists' Soviet-made fountain pens, coats, and ties with surprise, wondering: Are these all made in the Soviet Union? And now it is the rockets that send the solar planetary system into the universe and what is called the world's first "little moon" here in the United States that force them to think more seriously about socialism, the possibility of socialism, the people who live under this system, and why they chose this system, are proud of it, defend it, and think they are the happiest people, etc.

    The head of the most powerful socialist country in the world is now visiting the United States. This country is now on par with the United States, its industrial production has increased thirty-five times, and the number of engineers trained last year is twice as many as in the wealthiest capitalist country. These are things that even arrogant people have fully admitted. What seems particularly bold to some is that this country has announced that it will surpass the United States and that Soviet people will soon live richer lives than Americans. At this time, the entire United States wants to hear Khrushchev's speech, wants to see him, and wants to understand him.

    Wherever Khrushchev goes, thousands of people follow him. Journalists who have worked in the American press for more than ten years have witnessed this scene and say that it is unprecedented. Journalists only talk about this in private, and this example is not without interest. No wonder the New York newspapers reported that only 200,000 citizens welcomed Khrushchev in New York.

    In fact, even judging with the naked eye, it is clear that the number of people who welcomed Khrushchev in New York was two or three times more than what the newspapers reported, and perhaps even four times more. On the second day after arriving in New York, it seems that the report caused doubt and surprise, and a leader of the New York Police Department gave a television speech and had to answer the radio commentator, saying that the police department's statistics were wrong. According to accurate data, the number of people who welcomed Khrushchev reached 500,000! It is expected that more corrections will continue to be published, but it is not important how many people came to welcome him. What is important is that the newspapers were sold out one minute after publication, which shows that no one in the United States is not concerned about the current major events, and everything related to Khrushchev's visit to the United States.

    Khrushchev's speeches on various occasions are full of humor, jokes, folk sayings, and vivid examples. However, some people deliberately do not want to see the profundity and seriousness of Khrushchev's talk about world affairs behind these vivid humor. How many people are turning a blind eye to this? I am afraid I will make a mistake like the New York Police Department's calculators. There are probably still quite a few of them at the moment, but if I may say so, then they are definitely in the minority. And when Khrushchev put forward the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly, whether they expected this proposal or not, American newspapers published the full text of Khrushchev's speech in a prominent position.

    Here I would like to talk a little more about love and infatuation. Perhaps the idea that one must treat everything that the people of the great socialist country say with more caution is being implemented very slowly in the United States. Let the "Daily Mirror" add such a quarrelsome headline to its own report: "Khrushchev's Huge Plan. A Hodgepodge of Disarmament Old Tricks in Four Years." Let the "Daily News" or any other newspaper repeat this. However, the fact that all newspapers without exception value the Soviet proposal will help the average American, who not long ago was thought to be only infatuated with fashion, understand the truth of the matter.

    A banquet was held to entertain Khrushchev at the most noble "Ambassador" Hotel. The mayor of Los Angeles, like some other speakers, even talked nonsense, saying that our intention seemed to be to bury capitalists in the grave. One might be amazed at Nikita Sergeyevich's patience, as he repeatedly repeated what he had said at press conferences in Washington and on many other occasions. But the problem is not that the mayor does not understand the essence of the matter, but that the mayor is deliberately repeating it!

    What will win the final victory? You don't need to spend much time in the United States to find the answer to this question. At every small station, fearing that it would affect Khrushchev's "security", hundreds and thousands of residents gathered. They held signs with good-willed wisdom and passionate slogans: "Mr. Khrushchev, we are willing to live in peace with you and your country!" "Good morning! People from the Soviet Union!" "World peace!" There are also some other slogans. These slogans come from the heart and are a genuine desire for peace and mutual understanding. But in some individual places, slogans like "Remember the Hungarian Incident" also appeared. Interestingly, the Americans themselves quickly threw these signs on the ground. During his stay in the United States, this was probably the first time that Nikita Sergeyevich was able to get out of the iron donkey (as he called the black sedan he had to ride in after arriving here) and meet with all kinds of Americans for a while.

    The train left the small station where Nikita Sergeyevich talked to ordinary Americans for a while. He returned to the carriage and said humorously: "After six days of house arrest, I finally gained freedom and breathed the American air. Fortunately, I was not detained again."

    Nikita Sergeyevich rarely has the opportunity to talk to ordinary Americans. He is always on the road, and not only every hour, but also every minute is arranged. But, like all of us, he certainly felt the pulse of the American people, the pulse of the American people in 1959: "Although you have not been able to hear the opinions of many Americans, they shook your hand with friendly and peace-loving feelings." "...The itinerary of the visit arranged for you by the State Department has disappointed some people who wanted to welcome you and your wife. Your great country and people are peace-loving and friendly." "We are very happy that you came to our America as a guest. We are not afraid to express to you that we are convinced that your arrival will only increase the possibility of establishing lasting peace." "Like most Americans, I do not believe in communism, but I believe that we will become socialists in the future. I am an American... I do not agree with your ideas, but it is clear that you firmly believe that you are right."

  "Your disarmament proposal is the greatest political move of our time." Thousands of people came out to greet the train. These are Americans. They are straightforward, sociable, and cheerful people. Khrushchev visited the filming of "Can-Can" in Hollywood. People asked him: "Do you like American movie stars and their dances?" Khrushchev said: "It is difficult for me to comment on stars, because I am not familiar with astronomy. Soviet people prefer to look at the faces of actors, rather than..."

    But it was not only movie stars and "Can-Can" that interested those who flocked to the train. At the San Luis Obispo station, a worker squeezed out of the crowd with a child riding on his shoulders. The worker held a sign that read: "Disarmament with or without supervision!" Khrushchev said loudly: "Disarmament and establish supervision!" People applauded. The police pushed him into the crowd despite the fact that there was still a girl on the worker's shoulders. He waved the sign and smiled friendly.

    This is the mood revealed by Americans who can consider problems and solve problems themselves.

### 苏联“消息报”总编辑阿朱别依报道  美国人民热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫

    苏联“消息报”总编辑阿朱别依报道
    美国人民热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫
    本报讯　苏联“消息报”9月22日刊载了该报总编辑阿朱别依自洛杉矶往旧金山途中写回的一篇长文，题目是“热情的战士”，摘译如下：
    美国人是热情奔放和对什么都感兴趣的人。从好的意思来说，他们常常像大孩子，非常直率和活泼，他们会很快地同别人相识，并且很快就坦率地交谈起来。他们感染着种种“流行病”，一会儿是呼拉圈，一会儿是一个接一个的、往往“红”不了一个季节的电影明星，一会儿又是小汽车的新坐垫，新的香烟滤器、剃胡刀的夹具，红色或蓝色后跟的女人袜子。就这样年复一年，月复一月地没有休止。广告大有可为。
    大概，有人自命是衡量一般美国人社会兴趣的标准，自命能够最确实地阐述一般美国人的观点、情绪、思想和希望，而他们中间有些人曾估计苏联客人的到来是不会太惊动普通美国人的，普通美国人只会把这看作是轰动一时的新闻而已。有一次，赫鲁晓夫非常形象而确切地讲到了这一点，他说：“有些人希望我对美国的访问仅仅是提供可能，让人有机会在宴会席上和招待会上看到一个真正的、百分之百的布尔什维克”。
    然而，难道美国人民仅仅只有对琐碎事情感兴趣的权利吗？难道可以认为，伟大的美国人民（他们完成了技术革命，发明了流水作业生产法、建造了美丽的城市，给了世界以卓别麟的影片和罗伯逊的歌唱）只能局限于呼拉圈舞和新的香烟滤器吗？
    也许这种看法有一定的根据。一般美国人的这个世界同其它世界和大陆的人们的思想感情隔离了很久。好久以来，美国被认为是受不到什么侵害的地方。战争在远离美国数千公里外的地方爆发，烧毁他国的城市和乡村。美国人在想像中往往把饥饿、破坏同富裕的美国向这些辽远的受难地区派去的各种“支援队”联系起来。
    我在几年前来过美国，几乎走遍了全国。可能正因为如此，我现在才感到仅仅在几年之内（这点是我想强调的），美国人的情绪已经发生了巨大变化。为了证明无论这个国家或是那个国家的人民都热爱和平，那里也不用去——既不用到我们苏联，也不用到美国和其他任何国家去。野蛮民族是没有的，侵略的民族也是没有的。
    最近四年来科学和技术方面起了很多变化。在1955年，美国人还带着惊奇的眼光看我们苏联记者身上的苏联出品的自来水笔、外衣和领带，他们奇怪：难道这都是苏联制造的吗？而现在正是把太阳行星带到宇宙的火箭和在美国这里称呼为世界上的第一个“小月亮”迫使他们更加严肃地考虑考虑社会主义、社会主义的可能性、生活在这个制度下的人们以及他们为什么选择了这个制度、为它而骄傲，捍卫它并且认为自己是最幸福的人等等问题。
    世界上最强大的社会主义国家的首脑现在访问美国来了，这个国家现在已同美国并列，工业生产增加了三十五倍，去年培养出来的工程师人数比最富有的资本主义国家要多两倍。这些是傲慢的人都已完全承认的了。对某些人说来尤其显得大胆的是：这个国家已宣布，它要超过美国，苏联人很快就要生活得比美国人更富裕。在这时候，整个美国都想听听赫鲁晓夫的谈话，想见见他，想了解他。
    不论赫鲁晓夫到哪儿，总有成千的人跟着他。在美国报界工作不止十年的记者目睹此情此景，说这是前所未有的。记者们只是在私下谈论这件事，这个例子是不无兴趣的。无怪乎纽约各报报道说，在纽约欢迎赫鲁晓夫的市民只有二十万人。
    事实上，哪怕是用眼睛估量一下，就看得出，在纽约，欢迎赫鲁晓夫的人数比报纸所报道的人数要多两三倍，甚至可能要多四倍。在到达纽约的第二天，看来是由于报道引起了怀疑和惊异，纽约警察局的一位领导人发表了电视演说，不得不答复广播评论员，说警察局统计错了，根据确切的材料，欢迎赫鲁晓夫的人数达五十万！可以预料，还会继续发表更正，但是，来欢迎的人有多少并不重要，重要的是，报纸出版一分钟后就一抢而光，这表明，在美国没有一家不关心当前的重大事件，不关心与赫鲁晓夫访美有关的一切。
    赫鲁晓夫在各种场合的讲话充满了幽默、笑谈、民谚和生动的例子。可是有一些人故意不愿在这些生动的幽默后面看到赫鲁晓夫谈世界大事时的深刻性和严肃性。这种视而不见的人有多少呢？我怕自己像纽约警察局的计算员一样出错。他们目前大概还不少，不过，如果可以这样说的话，那末他们究竟是绝对的少数。而当赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会会议上提出了全面彻底裁军的建议时，无论是期望或不期望这一建议，美国报纸都以显著地位全文登载了赫鲁晓夫的讲话。
    这里我再谈一谈关于热爱和耽溺的看法。必须更慎重地对待伟大社会主义国家的人们所谈的一切，这一点也许在美国贯彻得很慢。让“每日镜报”给它自己的报道加上这样好争吵的标题：“赫鲁晓夫的巨大计划。四年内裁军老戏法的大杂会”。让“每日新闻”或其他任何报纸也去这样重复吧。然而，所有的报纸毫无例外地都重视苏联的建议，这个事实本身将有助于不久以前被人们认为只是迷恋时装的普通美国人了解事情的真相。
    在最高贵的“大使”饭店里设宴招待赫鲁晓夫。洛杉矶市长，像某些其他讲话的人一样，竟然胡说八道，说什么我们的意图似乎是要把资本主义的人埋入坟墓。对于尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇的耐心可能会感到惊奇，他一次又一次地重复他在华盛顿记者招待会上和其他许多场合中讲过的那些话。但问题是，并不是市长不明白事情的实质，而是市长故意重复！
    取得最后胜利的将是什么？在美国不需要花很多时间就可以找到这个问题的答案。在每个小车站上，不怕影响赫鲁晓夫的“安全”，聚集着成百成千的居民。他们手携着善意的智慧的热情的标语牌：“赫鲁晓夫先生，我们愿意和您、和贵国和平相处！”“早安！来自苏联的人们！”“世界和平！”还有一些其它标语。这些标语都是出自内心、人们真正对和平、互相了解的渴望。但是在某些个别地方，也出现像“记住匈牙利事件”这一类的标语。有趣的是，美国人自己很快就把这些标语牌扔在地上了。在美国逗留的这几天里，这大概是尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇第一次能够走出铁驴
  （他这样称呼他来到这里以后不得不乘坐的这辆黑色小轿车），同各式各样的美国人相聚一会儿。
    火车离开了小站，在这个小站上，尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇和普通美国人谈了一会儿。他回到车厢里诙谐地说：“在六天软禁之后，我第一次获得了自由，呼吸了一下美国的空气。好在没有把我又拘禁起来。”
    尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇很少有机会和普通美国人交谈。他一直是在路途中，不仅每小时，而且每一分钟都分配好了。但是，和我们大家一样，他当然感觉到了美国人的脉搏，1959年的美国人脉搏：“虽然很多美国人的意见您没能听到，但是他们却怀着友好的和渴望和平的心情同您握手”。“……国务院给您安排的访问计划，使得有些想要欢迎您和尊夫人的人失去了这种机会，这使人感到非常失望。你们伟大的国家和人民是爱好和平和友好的。”“我们很高兴您到我们美国来作客。我们不怕向您表示，我们深信您的到来只会增加建立持久和平的可能性”。“我像大多数美国人一样不信仰共产主义，但是我相信，我们将来会成为社会主义者。我是一个美国人……我不赞成你们的思想，但是显然，你们坚信自己是正确的”。
  “你们的裁军建议是当代最伟大的政治举动”。成千上万的人出来迎接火车。这是美国人。他们是一些直爽、爱好交际和快活的人。赫鲁晓夫在好莱坞参观了“坎坎”的拍摄情况。人们问他：“您喜欢美国的电影明星和他们的舞蹈吗？”赫鲁晓夫说：“关于明星我很难发表议论，因为我对天文学不内行。苏联人宁愿看演员的面孔，而不愿……”
    但是使那些涌向火车的人感兴趣的不仅是电影明星和“坎坎”。在圣路易—欧比斯颇车站上有一个工人从人群中挤过来，一个小孩骑在他肩上。工人手里拿着标语上面写着：“有没有监督，都要裁军！”赫鲁晓夫大声说：“裁军并建立监督！”人们鼓起掌来。警察不顾这个工人肩上还有一个女孩，把他推到人群里去了。他挥动着标语并且友好地微笑着。
    这就是能够自己考虑问题并解决问题的美国人所流露的心情。
