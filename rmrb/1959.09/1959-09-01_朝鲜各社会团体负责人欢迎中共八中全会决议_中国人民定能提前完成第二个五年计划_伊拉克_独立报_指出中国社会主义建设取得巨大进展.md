Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st. Leaders of various social organizations in Korea continue to issue statements, hailing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in China and welcoming the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Today, Pyongyang newspapers published a statement by Park Yong-guk, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, stating that the Chinese people, through the Great Leap Forward movement, achieved remarkable successes in industry and agriculture in 1958.

    He said that all the Chinese people and youth are now responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party to complete or nearly complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and are united and mobilized to fight. No slander or defamation by the enemy, and no opposition from right-leaning opportunists can stop the valiant advance of the 650 million people and youth united around the Chinese Communist Party. All the Korean people and youth believe that the Chinese people and youth will surely achieve victory in the struggle to complete the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.

    Kim Young-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, said today that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years. We hail the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people with excitement. She said, how amazing it is that the People's Republic of China, having gotten rid of imperialist oppression and enslavement, can exceed the production levels reached by capitalist powers over long periods of time in just a few years.

    She said that the Korean people and Korean women are inspired by the great victory of the Chinese people and are advancing bravely shoulder to shoulder with their Chinese brothers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, August 30th. The evening newspaper "Al-Istiqlal" published an editorial today stating that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party announced great progress in production and called on the Chinese people to realize the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan within this year, which proves the strength and consolidation of the socialist system being implemented in China. The Plenary Session also proved that the line pursued by the Chinese government under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, led by the brilliant leader Mao Zedong, is correct.

    The newspaper said that news released after the meeting showed that production in various sectors of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture in China has greatly increased during the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan. As a result, socialism has been consolidated and has made unimaginable great progress.

    The newspaper pointed out that China is a large country with a population of 650 million, which has suffered from enslavement and social diseases for centuries. Due to the heavy burden left over from the past, no one could have imagined that China would be able to overcome various difficulties in a very short period of time. Imperialists often hoped that the socialist system in China would fail. However, the wisdom, sincerity, and foresight of those who led the implementation of the socialist system in China shattered the hopes of the imperialists and reactionaries. This proves that the socialist system can shorten the time it takes for a country to transform from backwardness and corruption to freedom, happiness, and prosperity. This will become a source of inspiration for mankind, especially the people in its neighboring regions.

    新华社平壤31日电　朝鲜各社会团体的负责人继续发表谈话，欢呼中国人民大跃进的成就，欢迎中国共产党八届八中全会的决议。
    今天平壤报纸刊载的朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长朴容国的谈话说，中国人民通过大跃进运动，1958年在工业和农业方面取得了惊人的成就。
    他说，全体中国人民和青年现在响应中国共产党关于提前三年完成或接近完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的号召，一致动员起来进行斗争。敌人的任何诽谤和中伤，右倾机会主义分子的任何反对也不能阻挡团结在中国共产党周围的六亿五千万人民和青年的勇猛前进。全体朝鲜人民和青年相信，中国人民和青年在提前三年完成第二个五年计划的斗争中一定能取得胜利。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会副委员长金英秀今天发表谈话说，中国共产党八届八中全会提出了在十年以内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的号召。我们以激动的心情欢呼中国人民取得的灿烂成就。她说，摆脱了帝国主义的压迫和奴役的人民中国，只要在几年以后就可以超过资本主义强国在长久的年代里达到的生产水平，这是多么令人惊叹的事情。
    她说，朝鲜人民和朝鲜妇女为中国人民的伟大胜利所鼓舞，同中国兄弟们肩并肩地奋勇前进。
    新华社巴格达30日电　晚报“独立报”今天发表社论说，中国共产党八中全会宣布在生产方面取得了巨大的进展，并且号召中国人民在今年内实现第二个五年计划的主要指标，这证明了正在中国实行的社会主义制度的力量和巩固。全会还证明：中国政府在由英明的领袖毛泽东领导的中国共产党的指导下所执行的路线是正确的。
    这家报纸说，在这次会议以后发表的消息表明，中国在执行第二个五年计划期间，在重工业、轻工业和农业的各个部门中，生产大大增加了。这样一来，社会主义得到了巩固，而且取得了想像不到的巨大进展。
    这家报纸指出，中国是一个有六亿五千万人口的大国，几个世纪以来一直遭受奴役和社会疾病。由于过去遗留下来的沉重负担谁也想像不到，中国能够在很短的时间内克服种种困难。帝国主义者经常希望，社会主义制度在中国会失败。但是，在中国领导实行社会主义制度的那些人的智慧、真诚和远见，使帝国主义者和反动派的希望破灭了。这证明：社会主义制度能够缩短使一个国家从落后和腐败变为自由、幸福和繁荣的时间。这将成为人类，特别是它的邻近地区的人们鼓舞的源泉。
