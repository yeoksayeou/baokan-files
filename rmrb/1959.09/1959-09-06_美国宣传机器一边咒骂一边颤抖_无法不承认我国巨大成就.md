    American Propaganda Machine Trembles While Cursing
    Unable to Deny China's Great Achievements

    (Reported by this newspaper) The American bourgeois propaganda machine has been continuously and viciously slandering and cursing the great achievements of China's socialist cause and the Great Leap Forward in recent days. The "Wall Street Journal" vainly attempted to obliterate the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in last year's Great Leap Forward, saying that these achievements are "completely absurd and have absolutely no connection with reality." The "Baltimore Sun" also slandered the increase in China's industrial and agricultural production as "fabricated" and the Great Leap Forward as "on paper." In a dispatch from Tokyo, the United Press International slandered China's implementation of this year's production targets as a "cautious admission" that China's "dream of catching up with the production level of Western countries" has "failed."

    An article entitled "Red China, Big Failure" in an upcoming issue of the American magazine "Time," scheduled for publication the day after tomorrow, also brazenly attacked China's socialist construction. It said that China's verification of last year's output shows that it "made a big mistake in the economy" and is "an admission that the so-called bourgeois economic laws are, after all, correct."

    But all these vicious slanders and curses cannot conceal the fear and unease felt by the American imperialist reactionaries about the great achievements that the Chinese people have already made and will continue to make. According to United Press International, quoting the opinion of a certain economic expert in the U.S. government, he admitted that China's verified 1958 output "still shows a large increase in the output of grain, cotton, steel, and coal."

    The "New York Times" also admitted that "the reduced figures still illustrate the impressive achievements that Communist China has made economically."

    The United States Information Agency also helplessly admitted that China "has made some progress" and that it cannot be said that China "has failed economically or is likely to collapse."

    In a special article slandering the Chinese People's Communes, which was specially recommended by United Press International, although the author slandered the People's Communes in every possible way, on the other hand, he had to admit that the profound influence of the People's Communes at home and abroad has made "the West panic."

### 美国宣传机器一边咒骂一边颤抖  无法不承认我国巨大成就

    美国宣传机器一边咒骂一边颤抖
    无法不承认我国巨大成就
    本报讯　美国资产阶级宣传机器连日来不断地对我国社会主义事业和大跃进的伟大成就进行恶毒的诬蔑和咒骂。“华尔街日报“妄想一笔抹煞中国人民在去年大跃进中所取得的辉煌成就，说这些成就“完全是荒诞的，同现实简直毫无关系”。“巴尔的摩太阳报”也诬蔑中国工农业的增产是“捏造的”、跃进是“纸面上的”。合众国际社在一条从东京发出的电讯中诬蔑中国落实今年生产指标是“谨慎地承认”中国要“赶上西方国家生产水平”的“梦想失败了”。
    预定在后天出版的一期美国“时代”杂志也在一篇题为“赤色中国，大失败”的文章中放肆地攻击我国的社会主义建设。它说我国核实去年产量是表明“在经济方面犯了大错误”，是“承认所谓资产阶级的经济规律毕竟是正确的”。
    但是所有这些恶毒诬蔑和咒骂并不能掩饰美帝国主义反动派对于中国人民已经取得和将要继续取得的伟大成就所感到的恐惧和不安。据合众国际社引美国政府中某经济专家的意见说，他承认中国核实后的1958年产量“仍然表明粮、棉、钢、煤的产量有了很大的增加”。
    “纽约时报”也承认，“削减后的数字仍然说明了共产党中国在经济上取得了给人以深刻印象的成就。”
    美新处也无可奈何地承认说，中国“取得了某些进展”，不能说中国“经济失败了，或者可能崩溃”。
    在一篇被合众国际社特别推荐的诬蔑中国人民公社的专文中，尽管作者对人民公社百般诽谤，但另一方面他却不得不承认人民公社在国内外的深刻影响使“西方惊慌失措”。
