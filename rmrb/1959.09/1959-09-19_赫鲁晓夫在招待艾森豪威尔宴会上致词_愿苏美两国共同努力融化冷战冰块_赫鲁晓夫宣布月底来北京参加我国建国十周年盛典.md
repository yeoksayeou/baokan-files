Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 18th: According to a TASS report from Washington on September 17th: Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and his wife, Mrs. Khrushchev, hosted a banquet at the Soviet Embassy in Washington on the evening of the 16th in honor of U.S. President Eisenhower and his wife.

Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and U.S. President Eisenhower exchanged speeches at the banquet.

In his speech, Khrushchev said: This is the second day of our visit to the United States. We are very happy to visit your country, but you don't have to worry, I won't ask to extend my stay here (lively atmosphere). I am constrained by time. The day after I leave the U.S. and return home, I will fly to China. I am flying to China not to do anything secret, but to congratulate the great National Day of the People's China.

I spent a wonderful day with my friends today. You are exploiters, of course, some respectable exploiters, you exploit very thoroughly (lively atmosphere). Mr. Lodge was ordered to do this, he squeezed every last ounce of energy out of us (laughter). I don't know if the exploiters are satisfied with us, but the exploited in this case are satisfied with the exploiters (laughter).

Khrushchev said: "Perhaps because I am too hopeful, I believe that this visit, which we are making at your invitation, Mr. President (because otherwise we would not be here), and your upcoming visit to our country will promote the warming of international relations. The ice of the Cold War has not only cracked, but has already begun to break.

"I think that if we work together, we will be able to achieve this goal: truly melt the ice, create a normal living environment for the people of our two countries, and establish good friendly relations between the two countries." When you go to our country, you will feel the enthusiasm of our people towards you. But, I would like to ask you, when you feel this enthusiasm, not to try to separate the people from the government, as some people are trying to do. This is a very bad distinction, because in our country, what the people think and what they want is what the government expresses and does.

If the people express goodwill, then the government also holds this view. I would never even think of having to verify this consistency. When you visit the Soviet Union, you will be convinced of how united our people and government are, and we can understand each other at a mere glance. Let those who doubt it go to our country and see this unity for themselves.

Khrushchev concluded by proposing a toast to the health of the U.S. President, the First Lady, the guests, and everyone present. He said: "Although the wine is cold, I hope our relationship warms up day by day, I hope the atmosphere warms up, so that the ice of the Cold War melts and guarantees good conditions for peaceful coexistence between countries, between our two peoples." (Applause)

Eisenhower said in his speech that Khrushchev's visit to the United States was "the beginning of a new era." He said, "We have had meetings, and I hope that these meetings will at least mean the beginning of the melting of the ice, as you said, I hope so. But, nevertheless, I still disagree with some of the opinions you have put forward. You said that after you return to the Soviet Union, you will go to China. If I go to the Soviet Union, I will not go to China after leaving the Soviet Union."

Eisenhower raised his glass to congratulate Khrushchev on his health, and said that he hoped that the "mutual understanding" between the United States and the the Soviet Union "could lead to harmony and mutual understanding, so that we can build a good and just world, so that the whole world can prosper." He said, "I hope that this situation will appear in the whole world, especially between our two countries."

The banquet was conducted in a warm and unconstrained atmosphere.

    赫鲁晓夫在招待艾森豪威尔宴会上致词
    愿苏美两国共同努力融化冷战冰块
    赫鲁晓夫宣布月底来北京参加我国建国十周年盛典
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿17日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和夫人赫鲁晓娃16日晚上在苏联驻华盛顿大使馆设宴招待美国总统艾森豪威尔和夫人。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔在宴会上互相致词。
    赫鲁晓夫在致辞中说：这是我们在美国领土上访问的第二天。我们很高兴在贵国访问，但是你们不用担心，我不会要求延长我在你们这里访问的期限（场内活跃）。我受到时间的限制。我将在离美返国后的第二天飞往中国。我飞赴中国不是去干什么秘密的勾当，而是去祝贺人民中国的盛大国庆。
    我今天同朋友们一道度过了一个美好的日子。你们是剥削者，当然，是一些可敬的剥削者，你们剥削得很彻底（场内活跃）。洛奇先生受命这样做，他把我们的精力榨取得一干二净（笑声）。我不知道，剥削者是否对我们感到满意，但是被剥削者在这种情况下却对剥削者感到满意（笑声）。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“可能是因为我希望之心太切，因此我相信，我们应您，总统先生的邀请（因为，否则我们是不会来这里的）而作的这次访问以及您即将对我国进行的访问将促进国际关系的转暖，冷战的冰块已经不只是有了裂缝，而且已经开始破碎了。
    “我想，只要我们共同努力，我们将能达到这样的目的：真正融化冰块、为我们两国人民建立正常的生活环境和建立两国间的良好友谊关系。”当您到我国去的时候，您会感到我国人民对您表示的热情。但是，我要请求您，在您感到这种热情的时候，不要像某些人所力图做的那样，把人民和政府隔裂开来。这是非常不好的界限，因为在我国，人民所想的、所希望的，也就是政府所表达的、所做的。
    如果人民表示好感，那末政府也有这样的见解。我甚至从来不会去想必须校验这种一致。您到苏联访问的时候您就会确信，我们的人民和政府是多么团结，我们只要一眨眼彼此就能互相了解。让那些怀疑的人到我们那里去亲眼看看这种团结一致吧。
    赫鲁晓夫最后建议为美国总统，总统夫人，来宾们和所有在座的人的健康干杯。他说：“虽然酒是冷的，不过希望我们的关系一天天热起来，希望气氛转暖，使得冷战的冰层融化，并保证国与国之间、我们两国人民之间和平共处的良好条件。”（掌声）
    艾森豪威尔在致词中说，赫鲁晓夫的访问美国，是“新纪元的开始”。他说，“我们已经有过会晤，我希望这些会晤至少能够像您所说的那样意味着冰层融化的开始，我希望这样。但是，尽管如此，我还是不同意您提出的某些意见。您说过，你回苏联以后将到中国去。如果我去苏联，我是不会在离开苏联后到中国去的。”
    艾森豪威尔举杯祝贺赫鲁晓夫健康，并说，他希望美、苏两国的“互相了解都能够导致和睦和互相谅解，使我们能建立一个正义的好世界，使整个世界繁荣昌盛。”他说，“我希望，全世界、特别是我们两国之间会出现这种局面。”
    宴会是在热烈和无拘束的气氛中进行的。
