    Red Flag Planted on Small Blast Furnace
    ——A Record of the Red Flag No. 2 Furnace at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company
    Wang Dongshu
    Among the blast furnace group of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace is simply equipped, the smallest in volume (effective volume of only eight cubic meters), and the youngest, having only been put into production on November 8th of last year. But "ambition is not limited by age," it showed its capabilities soon after its birth. The main production indicators leaped upwards and soon became a red flag for small blast furnaces across the country. Its growth process fully demonstrates the vigorous vitality of small blast furnaces.
    Although the Red Flag No. 2 blast furnace has been in production for less than ten months, production is thriving. It has repeatedly created excellent results in terms of high quality, high yield, and low cost. In the eight months since it was put into production, the average utilization coefficient was 1.878 tons, and the average utilization coefficient from May to August was above two tons, with a record high of 2.6 tons. The qualified rate of pig iron has been 100% for eight months. The average coke ratio is 1,004 kg, and the lowest is only 740 kg. The average unit cost of pig iron from January to August is 156 yuan, 9 jiao, and 1 fen. Labor consumption is also low, with only 3.7 laborers needed to produce one ton of pig iron. No major accidents have occurred in the ten months since it was put into production. These undeniable facts are the victory of the Party's General Line and the victory of the "walking on two legs" policy. It is the most powerful refutation of the right-leaning opportunists' "not worth the loss" theory.
    Perhaps some people think that the Red Flag No. 2 small blast furnace must be naturally blessed and have many superior material conditions, but in fact, it is also an ordinary small blast furnace: it uses a tube-type hot blast stove, and the initial blast temperature was also very low, only 350°C; manual charging, using native coke as fuel, the grade of ore entering the furnace is 55%; 51 of the 57 production workers are farmers who have never smelted iron at all. However, creating production miracles does not depend solely on material conditions. The most decisive factor is those who are inspired by the General Line.
    The Red Flag No. 2 furnace is a pilot furnace of the Party Committee of the First Iron Smelting Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. The Party Committee supports and cares for every improvement it makes. Under the education of the Party, the workers' political consciousness has been unprecedentedly improved. In production, they adhere to putting politics in command, strive for the top, and everyone has a high sense of honor and responsibility, establishing the idea of "taking the furnace as home." Therefore, they can take care of the furnace meticulously and try every means to improve production. Sometimes, they would rather suffer a little bit themselves than let the furnace be slightly affected. Last December, with rain and snow mixed, the weather was freezing, and the ore was covered with mud. The workers were afraid that the blast furnace would get a stomachache, so they washed it basket by basket to prevent hanging. The workers carried forward the tradition of hard work and frugality, saving every yuan that could be saved. For example, when they learned that each incident of the tap hole not opening would cost 20 to 30 yuan in oxygen, they studied hard and practiced diligently to master the operating techniques. In this way, they ensured that tap hole accidents were eliminated. Not only that, but they also patiently picked up the ore and coke that fell on the ground and repaired a broken basket or a crowbar themselves before using it again. In order to improve production, the workers were reluctant to leave the furnace after work and used their free time to practice hammering, study hard, and improve their skills. Now, all the workers can operate independently.
    The steady increase in production is not without difficulties. The growth process of the Red Flag No. 2 furnace is a process of hard struggle against difficulties. The first problem encountered was the raw material. At that time, the ore was large in size, and the supply location often changed. Sometimes the materials used in the morning and afternoon were different. The physical properties and chemical composition were unclear, and the ore was mixed with mud. But they quickly overcame this obstacle. At that time, the leaders of the plant, on the one hand, strived to fix the source of ore, and on the other hand, boldly mobilized the workers, concentrating 70% of their energy on raw material management, educating the workers to understand the role of raw materials in blast furnace production, and conscientiously implementing the operating system, achieving "four prohibitions from entering the furnace" (that is, not entering the furnace without a component test report, not entering the furnace without sieving the ore and coke, not entering the furnace if the raw material particle size exceeds 25 mm, and not entering the furnace with muddy ore). As a result, the effect was remarkable. Just by washing the ore to reduce the amount of slag, one more batch of materials could be added per hour, increasing production by 2.2 tons per day, and the coke ratio was also reduced by 5/1000.
    The existing achievements of the Red Flag No. 2 blast furnace have not slowed down the pace of the workers' progress. For example, in January of this year, the utilization coefficient reached 1.2 tons, and the plant leaders and all employees proposed to implement the "operating policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio" and march towards higher goals. At that time, some people believed that small blast furnaces could not achieve this policy like large blast furnaces, saying that "the smelting intensity has already been increased," "if the air volume is increased again, the furnace will collapse," and "increasing the blast temperature will burn out the air pipe." In short, they were satisfied with a daily output of nine tons. However, the Party Committee resolutely criticized this right-leaning conservative thinking, resolutely supported the daring spirit of the broad masses, and took measures to increase the air volume, expand the tuyeres, and increase the air intake per cubic meter of volume from 2.5 cubic meters to 6 cubic meters. As the air volume increased, the blast temperature also needed to be increased. The workers also modified the hot blast stove themselves, removing the flue wall, reducing the flame arrester wall of the combustion chamber from 2 meters high to 1.25 meters, and adopted multi-nozzle combustion, increasing the blast temperature to 550°C. In this way, the smelting intensity was increased and stabilized at around 2, not only was the furnace condition normal, but the coke ratio was also reduced from 1.1 to 0.9. The operating policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio finally exerted its power on small blast furnaces, making the utilization coefficient break through the 2-ton mark, increasing to 2.2 tons, and first erected a red flag among small blast furnaces in the country.
    Conscientiously promoting advanced experiences and constantly innovating technology is one of their basic methods for promoting production. In the first half of this year alone, they have made eight major advanced experiences and technological innovations. For example, after the output increased and the number of charging increased, the original manual charging method became a weak link, so they mobilized the workers to use old materials to modify it into a simple mechanized hoist, so that the charging work closely followed. They hold a solid and serious attitude towards advanced experience, adhere to the end of the experiment, and are determined to make it blossom and bear fruit. When foreman Zhou Dexiang and a group of workers were testing multi-nozzle combustion, the ventilation cast pipe was of poor quality and was burned out when the blast temperature soared to 750°C. However, everyone was not discouraged, and the leadership firmly supported the continuation of the experiment, which finally stabilized the blast temperature at 500-600°C. After the experience of replacing limestone with quicklime as a flux spread, they immediately organized the use of all lime, resulting in a 17% increase in production and a 15% reduction in the coke ratio.
    In the struggle to seize high yield, high quality, and low cost, they grasped technical measures on the one hand and enterprise management on the other. According to specific conditions, they formulated a series of systems such as blast furnace operating procedures, safety regulations, and shift handover systems. Now every blast furnace worker understands the basic principles of operating points. For example, screening ore is one of the important conditions to ensure normal furnace temperature. After it was included in the regulations, the workers consciously implemented it, and there have been no furnace cooling accidents. Since the blast furnace is continuous production, it is very important to unify the three-shift operating technology. Therefore, it is stipulated that the production and equipment operation conditions should be introduced in detail during the shift handover to ensure that the handover is clear and the acceptance is clear. The three-shift foreman's meeting also analyzed the furnace conditions and carried out criticism and self-criticism, which played an important role in unifying thinking and unifying operations. In addition, they also grasped quality and work plans, not only engaged in monthly and weekly plans, but also established daily and shift plans. This has gradually put production on the normal track and effectively organized the labor enthusiasm of the masses.
    After the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee was announced, all employees were inspired and their enthusiasm was even higher. They resolutely responded to the Party's battle call and were determined to work hard in August and September to greet the brilliant and great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with greater achievements. Now they have set themselves the following goals for September: a blast furnace utilization coefficient of 2.8 tons; a first-class product rate of 80%; a coke ratio of no more than 0.9; and a unit cost of pig iron of no more than 130 yuan. This small blast furnace red flag, which was born and grew in the vigorous mass movement, is working hard to create newer achievements and strive to continue to be at the forefront of hundreds and thousands of small blast furnaces across the country, making greater contributions to the country's increased production of pig iron. The right-leaning opportunists' fallacy of "not worth the loss" will be completely bankrupt in the face of such vivid reality.

    红旗插上小高炉
    ——记马鞍山钢铁公司红旗二号炉
    王东曙
    马鞍山钢铁公司的高炉群中，红旗二号小高炉是一个装备简陋、容积最小（有效容积只有八立方米），是去年11月8日才投入生产的年纪最轻的小弟弟。但是“有志不在年高”，它在出世不久，就大露头角，主要生产指标飞跃上升，很快就成了全国小高炉的一面红旗。它的成长过程，是充分地显示了小高炉旺盛的生命力。
    红旗二号高炉投入生产虽然不到十个月，生产却蒸蒸日上。它接二连三地创造了优质、高产、低成本的优异成绩。投入生产的八个月当中，平均利用系数是一点八七八吨，5月至8月的平均利用系数都在二吨以上，最高纪录达到二点六吨。生铁合格率已有八个月是百分之百。平均焦比是一千零四公斤，最低时只有七百四十公斤。每吨生铁单位成本以1到8月平均计算为一百五十六元九角一分。人工消耗也少，生产一吨生铁只需三点七个劳动力。投入生产十个月内，没有发生过任何重大事故。这些无可辩驳的事实，是党的总路线的胜利，是“两条腿走路”的方针的胜利。它对右倾机会主义分子的“得不偿失”论是一个最有力的驳斥。
    或许有人以为红旗二号小高炉一定是得天独厚，具有许多优越的物质条件，其实它也是一个普普通通的小高炉：用的是管式热风炉，起初风温也很低，只有350℃；人工上料，用土焦做燃料，入炉矿石品位55％；五十七个生产工人中有五十一个是农民，根本没有炼过铁。但是，创造生产奇迹，却不单纯决定于物质条件，最起决定作用的还是那些为总路线所鼓舞的人。
    红旗二号炉是马鞍山钢铁公司第一炼铁厂党委的试验炉，党委对它的每一个改进都给予支持和关怀。在党的教育下，职工群众的政治觉悟空前提高，生产中坚持政治挂帅，力争上游，人人都有高度的荣誉感和责任感，树立了“以炉为家”的思想，因而能够无微不至地爱护炉子，千方百计地设法提高生产。有时，他们宁愿自己受点苦，也不愿炉子稍受影响。去年腊月，雨雪交加，天寒地冻，矿石上沾满泥巴，工人们怕高炉吃坏肚子，憋风挂料，就一箩一箩地淘洗。工人们发扬了艰苦朴素的传统，尽量节省可以节省的每一元钱。例如，当他们知道了每发生一次出铁口打不开的事故，需要耗用二、三十元氧气费用的时候，便勤学苦练，掌握操作技术。这样，就保证杜绝了出铁口事故。不仅如此，对掉落在地上的矿石和焦炭，也都耐心地把它拣起来；一个箩、一根钎子坏了，都自己动手修好再用。为了搞好生产，工人们下了班也不肯离开炉子，利用空闲时间练习打锤，勤学苦练，提高技术。现在，所有的工人都能独立地操作了。
    生产节节上升，并不是丝毫没有困难的。红旗二号炉的成长过程，正是一段与困难进行艰苦斗争的过程。首先碰到的是原料关。当时矿石块度大，供矿地点常变，有时上午和下午用料都不一样，物理性能和化学成份搞不清，矿石夹杂着泥巴。但是他们很快地度过了这一关。当时，厂的领导一方面争取固定矿源，一方面放手发动工人，集中70％的精力从事原料管理，教育工人懂得原料对高炉生产的作用，认真执行操作制度，做到“四不入炉”（即没有成份化验单不入炉，矿石焦炭不过筛不入炉，原料粒度超过二十五公厘的不入炉，泥巴矿不入炉）。结果，成效显著，仅由于把矿石洗净，减少渣量，每小时就可以多加一批料，每天就能增产二点二吨，焦比也降低了千分之五。
    红旗二号高炉已有的成绩，并没有使工人们放慢前进的步伐，如今年1月份利用系数已达到一点二吨，厂领导和全体职工就提出要执行“提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针”，向更高的目标进军。当时，有人认为小高炉不可能像大高炉一样地实现这一方针，说什么“冶炼强度已经提高了”，“风量再增，炉子就会垮”，“风温提高会把风管烧毁”。总之，他们对日产九吨已是心满意足。但是党委坚决批判了这种右倾保守思想，坚决支持广大群众的敢想敢干精神，采取措施，加大风量，扩大风口，将每立方米容积的受风量由二点五立方米提高到六立方米。随着风量的增大，风温也需要提高。职工们又自己动手改造热风炉，拆掉烟道墙，把燃烧室反火墙由二米高降为一点二五米，并采用了多嘴燃烧，风温升高到550℃。这样，冶炼强度提高并稳定在二左右，不仅炉况正常，焦比还由一点一降到零点九。提高冶炼强度与降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，终于在小高炉上也发挥了它的威力，使利用系数突破了二吨大关，提高到二点二吨，在全国小高炉中首先树起了红旗。
    认真推广先进经验和不断革新技术是他们推动生产的基本方法之一。仅在今年上半年，他们就已作出八项重大的先进经验和技术革新。如产量提高，上料次数增加后，原来的手提上料方法就成为薄弱环节，他们就发动工人利用旧料改制成了简易的机械化提升机，使上料工作紧紧跟了上去。他们对先进经验是抱着踏实认真的态度，坚持试验到底，决心使它开花结果。工长周德祥和一批工人试验多嘴燃烧时，由于通风铸管质量不好，风温猛增到750℃时被烧坏了。但大家并不泄气，领导上也坚定不移的支持继续试验，终于使风温稳定在500—600℃。以生石灰代替石灰石做熔剂的经验传播后，他们立即组织全部使用石灰，结果增产了17％，降低焦比15％。
    在争夺高产、优质、低成本的斗争中，他们一手抓技术措施，一手抓企业管理。根据具体条件，制定了高炉操作规程，安全规程和交接班制度等一系列制度。现在每一个高炉工人都已懂得了操作要点的基本道理。如矿石过筛是保证炉温正常的重要条件之一，订入规程后，工人就自觉的执行，一直没发生过炉冷事故。由于高炉是连续性生产，三班操作技术统一非常重要，因而规定在交接班时详细介绍生产和设备操作情况，做到交得清、接得明。三班工长碰头会上也对炉况进行分析，开展批评与自我批评，对统一思想、统一操作起了重要的作用。此外还抓了质量和作业计划，既搞月、周计划，又建立日、班计划。这就使生产逐步走上了正常的轨道，把群众的劳动热情有效地组织起来。
    中央八届八中全会决议公布后，全体职工精神振奋，热情更加高涨，坚决响应党的战斗号召，决心大干8、9月，以更大的成就，迎接光辉伟大的建国十周年。现在他们给自己确定了9月份的奋斗目标：高炉利用系数二点八吨；一级品达到80％；焦比不超过零点九；生铁单位成本不超过一百三十元。这一面在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中诞生和成长的小高炉红旗，正在努力创造更新的成绩，争取继续走在全国成百上千的小高炉的前列，为国家增产生铁作出更大的贡献。右倾机会主义分子所谓“得不偿失”的谬论，在这样活生生的现实面前，必将彻底地破产。
