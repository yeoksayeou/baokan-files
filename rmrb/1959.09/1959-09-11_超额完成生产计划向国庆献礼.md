Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong Province has exceeded its annual production target for irrigation and drainage machinery four months ahead of schedule, providing strong material support to the agricultural front in overcoming waterlogging and drought disasters. Statistics up to the end of August show that Shandong has produced 87,588 horsepower of various irrigation and drainage machines, exceeding the annual target by 6.95%, an increase of 82.33% compared to the same period last year.

In the production process of irrigation and drainage machinery, the Shandong Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry and the 42 factories responsible for the manufacturing tasks overcame numerous difficulties and adopted a series of measures. They focused on the preparatory work before the trial production of new products, and adopted a method of cross-phasing trial production with small-batch production during the trial production process, which greatly shortened the trial production time and created favorable conditions for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule. In terms of production organization, the Department of Mechanical Industry, according to the arrangement of the plan, conducted task sequencing, and each factory also scheduled progress and formulated measures to ensure that the plan was closely linked at every stage and firmly grasped at every level. Each product was not only assigned to the factory, but also discussed by the workers and implemented to the workshops, sections, and groups according to parts and components, and according to procedures. At the same time, each factory strengthened scheduling work, promptly grasped the production situation, and solved problems in production. In terms of material supply, the province adhered to the principles of centralized use, ensuring key projects, and using specialized materials for specific purposes.

In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient production capacity, the competent authorities also organized large-scale cooperation between factories. Qingdao organized large-scale cooperation in irrigation and drainage machinery, frequently sent cadres to conduct in-depth inspections of the progress of irrigation and drainage machinery, and promptly assisted in solving problems. Weifang organized nine factories to cooperate with the Huafeng Machine Factory. Jining also organized all the small factories in the city to cooperate with the Yongshun Iron Factory in manufacturing parts and components for twelve-horsepower diesel engines. Yantai Prefecture even organized all the machinery industry in the counties and cities of the entire region to go all out to serve the manufacturing of irrigation and drainage machinery, and temporarily transferred more than 80 technicians to directly support the production of irrigation and drainage machinery. At the same time, the Provincial Department of Mechanical Industry also organized cooperation between regions, and quickly helped the factories overcome the difficulties of weak technical strength and unbalanced equipment.

　　Prioritizing Others, Putting Self Second

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 10th: Factories and mines in Xining are advancing together, with 50 factories already completing their third-quarter or annual plans ahead of schedule.

In the midst of the great battle of September, the factories and mines in the Xining area, displaying the communist spirit of "prioritizing others and putting self second," are actively supporting others in order to achieve common progress. Now, 50 factories here have already completed their third-quarter plans or annual plans ahead of schedule.

The workers of the Xining Electrical Machinery Hardware Manufacturing Factory, upon hearing that the Xinsheng Automobile Assembly and Parts Factory was lacking small steel materials, mica sheets, paint, molds, etc., gave a batch of six-centimeter round wire, mica sheets, and paint that the factory also needed to the Automobile Assembly and Parts Factory, and helped make a batch of wire-drawing molds. The workers of the Xinsheng Automobile Assembly and Parts Factory, learning that the Xining Electrical Machinery Hardware Manufacturing Factory urgently needed a batch of round iron and more than 900 gears, also fulfilled their needs as desired. The relationship between the two factories is very harmonious. Now, the Electrical Machinery Hardware Factory has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule; the Automobile Assembly and Parts Factory has completed its third-quarter production plan ahead of schedule. The Xining Machinery Factory made a batch of boilers, but the factory did not have the angle steel for the boiler frame; the Xining Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory squeezed out some of its capacity to help solve the problem. In the rush to repair the railway, the Qinghai Provincial Railway Bureau needed to repair and weld some machinery, and the Xining Machinery Factory also dispatched several welders and riveters with higher technical levels to support them.

Cooperation is also widely carried out between workshops and workshops, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals within each factory. The power distribution group of the original power workshop of the Qinghai Wool Processing Factory had very heavy tasks, but when they saw that the carpet and wool-sorting workshops used many scissors, which were often sharpened manually after being dulled, costing a lot of labor and affecting the rapid completion of production tasks, they collectively researched and developed an electrolytic knife sharpener and supplied it to the carpet and wool-sorting workshops, increasing the knife sharpening efficiency by five times. The third quarter is the peak production season for this factory, with more raw materials coming in, and the female workers in the wool-sorting workshop are particularly busy; although the tasks of other workshops are also very heavy, they still draw a batch of strength to support the wool-sorting workshop. The fitters in the metalworking workshop of the Xining Electrical Machinery Hardware Manufacturing Factory figured out ways to improve tools and improve work efficiency. After completing their group's tasks ahead of schedule, they took over all 500 sprayer assembly tasks of the assembly workshop.

　　Learning from the Advanced, Catching up with the Advanced

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th: A competition upsurge has been set off in factories and mines in the Chenxian Prefecture, and thirteen factories and mines have completed their third-quarter production plans ahead of schedule.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th: Thirteen factories and mines in Chenxian Prefecture, Hunan, have already completed their third-quarter production plans ahead of schedule. These thirteen factories and mines are: Leiyang Iron Factory, Anren Iron Factory, Guiyang Manganese Mine, Anren Manganese Mine, Guiyang Lead-Zinc Mine, Lanja Ceramic Factory, Guiyang Graphite Mine, Yizhang Clothing Factory, Leiyang Power Plant, Yizhang Meitian Coal Mine, Leiyang Shijie Coal Mine, Lanja Yuanjia Coal Mine, and Guiyang Heyao Coal Mine.

Since entering the third quarter, the workers of these thirteen factories and mines have been bravely fighting to complete the national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas. In particular, the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been conveyed, which has further boosted the enthusiasm of the workers. They enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party, on the one hand criticizing right-leaning slackening emotions, and on the other hand quickly launched a socialist labor competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and competing with the advanced, and production increased day by day. The workers of the Leiyang Iron Factory issued the oath of "not afraid of the hot weather, not afraid of sweating a lot, producing more iron, producing good iron, and presenting a generous gift to National Day," overcoming the difficulties of hot weather and insufficient fuel, and the competition between workshops and workshops, furnaces and furnaces, and groups and groups was in full swing. They adopted measures such as parallel connection of fans, transformation of hot blast stoves, and increased wind power, which increased the output of pig iron in August by 17% compared with July, and the pass rate increased to 96%, completing the third-quarter plan 36 days ahead of schedule.

Strengthening the leadership of the Party, continuously improving the style of work, leading cadres going deep into the masses, and working with the masses to overcome difficulties in a timely manner are a powerful guarantee for the thirteen factories and mines to complete their plans ahead of schedule. After criticizing right-leaning slackening emotions, the leadership work became more in-depth and specific. In the workshops and work areas, leading cadres can be seen at any time working with the masses and solving problems together. The transportation work area of the Guiyang Graphite Mine was a weak link in the entire mine, and the task was completed poorly. Secretary of the Party Committee Deng Chunhui went deep into the work area, brainstormed with the workers, worked together, and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. The transportation volume increased from the original maximum of 22.8 tons per day to 30.3 tons.

At present, the workers of these thirteen factories and mines are continuing to launch a red flag competition movement of high yield, high quality, and low cost, determined to create greater achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.

    超额完成生产计划向国庆献礼
    抓措施  搞协作
    山东提前四个月完成全年排灌机械制造任务，给农业战线战胜水旱灾害以有力的支援。
    新华社济南10日电　山东省提前四个月超额完成了今年的排灌机械制造任务，给农业战线战胜水旱灾害以有力的物质支援。截至8月底的统计，山东已生产出各种排灌机械八万七千五百八十八马力，超额6.95％完成了今年全年任务，比去年同期增长了82.33％。
    在排灌机械的生产过程中，山东省机械工业厅和担负承制任务的四十二个工厂，克服了重重困难，采取了一系列的措施。他们抓住新产品试制前的准备工作，在试制过程中采取试制和小批生产交叉进行的办法，使试制时间大为缩短，为提前完成全年计划创造了有利条件。在生产组织工作方面，机械工业厅根据计划的安排，进行任务排队，各厂也都排出进度，订出措施，使计划环环扣紧，层层抓死，每件产品不仅落实到厂，而且经过职工讨论，按零件部件，按工序，逐一落实到车间、工段和小组。同时，各厂还加强了调度工作，及时掌握生产情况，解决生产中的问题。在材料供应方面，全省坚持了集中使用、保证重点和专料专用的原则。
    为了克服生产能力不足的困难，主管部门还组织各厂开展了厂际之间的大协作。青岛市组织排灌机械大协作，经常派干部深入检查排灌机械进度情况，及时协助解决问题。潍坊市组织九个厂同华丰机器厂协作。济宁市也组织了全市所有的小厂，为永顺铁工厂协作制造十二马力柴油机的零件部件。烟台专区更组织全区各县、市所有机械工业，全力以赴地为制造排灌机械服务，并且临时抽调八十多名技工直接支援排灌机械生产。同时，省机械厅也组织了地区之间的协作，迅速帮助各厂克服了技术力量薄弱和设备不平衡的困难。
    先他人　后自己
    西宁各厂矿企业共同跃进，已有五十个工厂提前完成第三季度或全年计划。
    新华社西宁10日电　西宁地区各工矿企业在大战9月中，发扬“先他人、后自己”的共产主义风格，主动支援别人，求得共同跃进。现在这里已有五十个工厂提前完成第三季度计划或全年计划。
    西宁电机五金制造厂的职工们，听说新生汽车制配厂缺少一种小型钢材和云母片、喷漆、模具等，便把本厂也需要的一批六厘米元丝、云母片和喷漆给了汽车制配厂，并帮助做了一批拉丝模具。新生汽车制配厂职工，了解到西宁电机五金制造厂急需一批元铁和九百多个齿轮，也如愿以偿地满足了他们的需要。两个厂的关系十分融洽。现在，电机五金厂已提前完成全年生产计划；汽车制配厂已提前完成第三季度生产计划。西宁机械厂做了一批锅炉，可是本厂没有做锅炉外架的角钢；西宁农牧机械厂便从本厂挤出力量帮助解决。青海省铁路局在赶修铁路中，有的机械需要修理、电焊，西宁机械厂也抽出几名技术水平较高的电焊工、铆工去支援。
    各工厂内部车间与车间、小组与小组、个人与个人之间，也广泛展开协作。青海省绒毛加工厂原动车间配电组本身的任务十分繁重，但是他们看到地毯、选毛两个车间使用剪刀多，用钝后常用人工磨，花费很多劳动力，影响生产任务迅速完成，于是集体研究制出一种电解磨刀器，供给地毯、选毛车间，使磨刀效率提高了五倍。这个厂第三季度是生产旺季，原料来得较多，选毛车间的女工们特别忙碌；其他车间的任务虽然也十分繁重，但是仍然抽出一批力量支援选毛车间。西宁电机五金制造厂金工车间钳工组工人，想办法改进工具，提高工作效率，把本组任务提前做完以后，又把装配车间的五百台喷雾器装配任务全部包了下来。
    学先进　赶先进
    郴县专区各厂矿掀起竞赛热潮，十三个厂矿已提前完成了第三季度生产计划。
    据新华社长沙10日电　湖南郴县专区已经有十三个厂矿提前完成了第三季度的生产计划。这十三个厂矿是：耒阳铁厂，安仁铁厂，桂阳锰矿，安仁锰矿，桂阳铅锌矿，蓝加陶瓷厂，桂阳石墨矿，宜章被服厂，耒阳电厂，宜章梅田煤矿，耒阳石界煤矿，蓝加袁家煤矿，桂阳荷叶煤矿。
    进入第三季度以来，这十三个厂矿职工便为提前和超额完成国家计划而展开英勇奋战。特别是党的八届八中全会精神传达后，更加鼓舞了职工们的干劲。他们热烈地响应党的号召，一面批判右倾松劲情绪，一面迅速地掀起了一个学先进、赶先进、赛先进的社会主义劳动竞赛高潮，生产日日增高。耒阳铁厂的职工发出“不怕天气热，不怕流汗多，多出铁，出好铁，厚礼献给国庆节”的誓言，战胜了酷热天和燃料不足的困难，车间与车间，炉与炉，组与组，竞赛热火朝天。他们采取了风机并联、改造热风炉、加大风力等措施，使8月份的生铁产量比7月份提高17％，合格率提高到96％，提前三十六天就完成了第三季度计划。
    加强党的领导，不断改进工作作风，领导干部深入群众，同群众一道及时克服疑难，这是十三个厂矿提前完成计划的有力保证。经过批判右倾松劲情绪以后，领导工作更加深入具体了。在车间、工区，随时都可以看到领导干部在跟群众一道劳动，一道解决问题。桂阳石墨矿运输工区是全矿薄弱环节，任务完成得较差，党委书记邓春惠深入到工区，同工人一起想办法，一起劳动，大大鼓舞了工人干劲，运输量由原来每天最高二二点八吨提高到三零点三吨。
    目前，这十三个厂矿的职工们，正在继续热烈地展开高产、优质、低成本的红旗竞赛运动，决心创造更大的成绩迎接国庆十周年。
