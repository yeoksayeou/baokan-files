Comrades:

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the People's Republic of China, we are very happy to express our fraternal and warm respect to you.  The Italian Communists and all our peace-loving and progressive Italian compatriots extend their respects to the Party that led the Chinese people in a long and arduous struggle for national and social liberation, and to the Party that, under the leadership of our dear and respected Comrade Mao Zedong, has led the Chinese working class, peasants, and all the people to victory after victory along the road of socialist construction in the past ten years.

    Dear comrades, thousands of kilometers separate us, and the conditions under which we work and struggle have been and are very different. However, in all these years, we have always felt very close to you. We have shared your pain and rejoiced in your achievements; therefore, we regard your great National Day as our own. Not only our representatives sent to Beijing, but all our comrades will once again celebrate October 1 with you.

    Just as the achievements of the socialist world, the achievements of the national liberation struggles of the colonial countries, and the achievements of the workers' and democratic movements in capitalist countries have forced some major imperialist blocs to revise their past positions and abandon, at least temporarily, their open struggle against socialist countries, the most reactionary groups refuse to abandon the "Cold War" and stop slandering your country, continue to occupy part of your territory, and extend provocations to your borders.

    Some of them think that they can simply write off the People's Republic of China by denying your achievements and even denying the fact that you exist as a sovereign state. Compared with today, when all aspects of international life are being increasingly influenced by your country, their attempt seems extremely foolish.

    We know that you have achieved such achievements because of the unity and combativeness of your Party, because of the close and constant contact between the Party and the masses of the people, and because of the Party's ability to apply the great truth of Marxism-Leninism to the living reality of your great country, making the great truth of Marxism-Leninism not only the driving force of the members of your great Party, but also the driving force of hundreds of millions of people, who, with their wisdom and labor, with their tenacity and spirit of sacrifice, have transformed your great country and eliminated the backwardness of thousands of years in just a few years, so that the changes in material and cultural life since the founding of the People's Republic ten years ago are more profound than the changes of the past thousands of years.

    The Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement, as well as the achievements affirmed by your recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, are guarantees for your more rapid and victorious progress in the future.

    While re-launching a nationwide people's movement to strive for peace, defend and develop democratic freedom, and embark on profound social reforms, the Italian Communists are preparing for their Ninth National Congress, and they are watching your example with fraternal admiration and pride. We recognize that there are powerful hostile forces facing us, both in Italy and around the world, but we know that as long as we are always good at better uniting the masses of the people and making our Party a wise and firm, wise and decisive leader of our people, we will be able to overcome them.

    We wish you new and greater achievements in your efforts for the benefit of your people, for peace and for the benefit of all mankind. May the east wind blow ever more vigorously around the world!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the Communist Party of China, which leads 650 million Chinese people on the glorious road of socialism!

    Long live the fraternal and militant unity of our two parties!

                          Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party
                                                Togliatti
                                    September 22, 1959, in Rome

    意大利共产党中央委员会政治局委员、意大利共产党代表团团长
    吉罗拉马里·考西同志宣读的意大利共产党中央委员会贺信亲爱的同志们：
    值此中华人民共和国十周年的时候，能向你们表达我们兄弟般的热烈的敬意，我们感到十分高兴。意大利共产党员以及我们所有爱好和平和进步的意大利同胞，谨向领导中国人民为民族和社会解放而进行过长期艰苦斗争的党，向过去十年内在我们亲爱的尊敬的毛泽东同志领导下领导中国工人阶级、农民以及全体人民沿着社会主义建设的道路从胜利走向胜利的党致以敬礼。
    亲爱的同志们，我们之间相距成千上万公里，我们工作和斗争的条件过去和现在都非常不同，然而，在所有这些年代里，我们一直感到和你们非常接近，我们分担了你们的痛苦，我们为你们的成就而感到欢欣；因此我们就把你们伟大的国庆也看成是自己的国庆，不仅是我们派往北京的代表们，而且我们全体同志，都将再一次和你们一起庆祝10月1日。
    正当社会主义世界的成就、殖民地各国人民解放斗争的成就以及资本主义国家工人和民主运动的成就迫使一些主要的帝国主义集团修改他们过去的立场并放弃至少暂时放弃他们对社会主义国家进行公开斗争的时候，最反动的集团却不肯放弃“冷战”和停止对你们国家的诬蔑，继续占领你们的一部分领土，并且伸延到你们的边境进行挑衅。
    他们中间有些人以为否认你们的成就，甚至否认你们作为主权国家存在的事实，就可以把中华人民共和国一笔勾消。他们的这种企图，和国际生活的各个方面都受到你们国家日益增长的影响的今日相比，显得极其愚蠢。
    我们知道，你们所以取得这样成就，是由于你们党的团结和战斗性，由于党和人民群众紧密的和经常不断的联系，由于党能够把马克思列宁主义的伟大真理应用于你们伟大国家的活生生的实际，使马克思列宁主义的伟大真理不仅成为你们伟大的党的成员的动力，而且成为千百万人民的动力，这些人以他们的智慧和劳动，以他们的顽强和牺牲精神，使你们伟大的国家面目一新，在短短几年里消除了千百年来的落后状态，使人民共和国建国十年以来在物质和文化生活方面所起的变化，要比以往千百年来的历代的变化要深刻得多。
    大跃进和人民公社运动以及你们最近的八届八中全会所肯定的成绩，都是你们今后更迅速和更胜利地前进的保证。
    在重新掀起全国规模的人民运动，以争取和平、保卫并且发展民主自由，以及着手进行深刻的社会改革的情况下，意大利共产党人正在筹备他们的第九次全国代表大会，他们以兄弟般的钦佩和骄傲的心情注视着你们的榜样。我们认识到在我们面前，在意大利和在全世界，存在着强大的敌对势力，然而我们知道，只要我们总是善于更好地团结人民群众，并使我们的党成为我们全国人民的既英明又坚定，既明智又果断的领导者，我们就能够战胜它们。
    祝你们为了你们人民的利益，为了和平和全人类的利益所作的努力取得新的更大的成就。愿东风在全世界吹得日益猛烈！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    领导六亿五千万中国人民在光辉的社会主义道路上前进的中国共产党万岁！
    我们两党兄弟般的战斗的团结万岁！
                          意大利共产党中央委员会
                                                陶里亚蒂
                                    1959年9月22日于罗马（附图片）
