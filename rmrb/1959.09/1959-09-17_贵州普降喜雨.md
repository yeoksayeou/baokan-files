The areas with the most rainfall were Pingba, Nayong, and Puding counties, with rainfall ranging from 50 to 80 millimeters; in the majority of areas in Guiyang, Zunyi, and 21 other cities and counties, rainfall ranged from 20 to 47 millimeters. The drought situation in these areas has been basically alleviated. The drought situation in other parts of the province has also been mitigated or eased to varying degrees. At present, the rain in the eastern and southern parts has not yet stopped. In areas where the rain has thoroughly soaked the ground, farmers of all ethnic groups are seizing the time after the rain to carry out autumn sowing and strengthen field management of late autumn crops.
