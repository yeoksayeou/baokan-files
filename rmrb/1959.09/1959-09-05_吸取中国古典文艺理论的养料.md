    Drawing Nourishment from Classical Chinese Literary Theory
　  Chun Cheng
    To establish our own Marxist literary theory and criticism in China, we must use the Marxist viewpoint to summarize the experience of Chinese literary creation and the achievements of theoretical criticism from ancient times to the present. Good foreign experiences are worth absorbing; but foreign experiences alone are clearly not enough. Our own literary theory and critical heritage needs to be critically inherited by us.
    Since liberation, many people have done a lot of work in this area, and the results have been remarkable. Some specialized books have been published, and some professional publications have published many articles on this topic. There has also been some material in other publications and newspapers. In the past few months, "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) has published articles related to this area in the columns "Wenyi Suibi" (Literary Essays) and "Dushu Zhaji" (Reading Notes). The articles are short in length, raise specific issues, are linked to today's creation and criticism, and are written in a relatively lively and engaging manner, able to attract people to develop an interest in classical literary theory and criticism.
    The article "True Friend or Intimidating Friend" introduces a passage from "Yan Shi Jiaxun" (Family Instructions of the Yan Clan), advising people to humbly listen to the opinions of others when writing articles, modify them accordingly, and not "stubbornly rely on oneself." A casual essay discussing the poems of Li Yishan elaborates on the principle that literary critics should be familiar with life, starting from an understanding of a single line of poetry. The article "Rereading ‘Renjian Cihua’" (Human Words on Poetry) analyzes Wang Guowei's literary thoughts and worldview, its valuable parts, and the parts that should be criticized. In addition, articles such as "The Kind of Inspiration for Writing," "Artistic Space," "On Aphorisms," "Accumulate Deeply, Then Express Sparsely," and "Explanation of Elegance" all discuss some beneficial opinions.

    吸取中国古典文艺理论的养料
　  春城
    要建立中国自己的马克思主义的文艺理论和批评，必须运用马克思主义的观点来总结中国从古迄今的文艺创作经验和理论批评的成果。外国的好经验值得我们吸收；但是只有外国的，显然是不够的。我国自己的文艺理论批评遗产，需要我们来加以批判地承继。
    解放以来，许多人在这方面做了不少工作，成绩显著。出版了一些专书，也有一些专业刊物发表了不少关于这方面的文章，在其他刊物报纸上也有一些材料。这几个月来“文艺报”在“文艺随笔”和“读书札记”等栏目内登载了有关这方面的文章。篇幅短小，问题提得具体，联系今天的创作和批评，写得比较生动活泼，能够吸引人发生对于古典文艺理论批评的兴趣。
    “诤友或畏友”一文介绍了“颜氏家训”中的一段文章，劝人写文章应该虚心听取旁人意见，加以修改，不要“师心自任”。讨论李义山诗的一篇随笔，则从对于一句诗的理解，阐发了文艺批评家应该熟悉生活的道理。“重读‘人间词话’”一文，分析了王国维的文艺思想和世界观，它们的可取的部分和应该批判的部分。此外，“文思泉涌之类”“艺术的间空”“谈警句”“厚积而薄发”“释雅致”等文，也都谈了一些有益的意见。
