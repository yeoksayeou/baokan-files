Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Early autumn crops have begun to be harvested, and late autumn crops are also maturing one after another. All regions attach great importance to the selection and retention of seeds for autumn harvest crops. At present, provinces and regions such as Zhejiang, Henan, Jiangxi, Qinghai, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and Guizhou have successively issued notices or held meetings to make arrangements, requiring that the selection and retention of seeds for autumn harvest crops be done in a timely manner, so as to lay a good material foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.
    In addition to requiring a mass seed selection campaign, Zhejiang Province also focused on summarizing and evaluating fine varieties. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Shanxi Provincial Women's Federation, and the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture issued a joint notice, requiring young members of the communes and women members of the communes throughout the province to take active action to launch a upsurge of seed selection and seed collection, comparing their enthusiasm, speed, and quality. Before and after the autumn harvest, the province plans to select and retain 730 million jin of crop seeds and collect 40 million jin of forest seeds. Jiangsu Province requires that all regions, in addition to continuing to implement the policy of "self-propagation, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use" of seeds to ensure that sufficient seeds are retained according to next year's planting plan, should also seize the work of purchasing fine seeds. In many areas of Henan Province, under the deployment of leading organs, have already taken active action. In Nanle County, the secretaries of the twelve people's communes took the lead and convened on-site seed selection meetings in different areas to exchange seed selection experience. At present, the seed selection work in this county has been fully launched. As of the end of August, 15,000 mu of corn, 14,000 mu of sweet potatoes, 1,500 mu of cotton, and 18,000 mu of soybeans have been selected.

    浙江等地精选良种
    为农业增产奠定物质基础
    新华社12日讯　早秋作物已经开始收获，大秋作物也陆续成熟，各地对秋收作物的选种留种工作都十分重视。目前，已有浙江、河南、江西、青海、河北、山东、四川、山西、江苏、新疆、贵州等省、区先后向各地发出通知或开会作了布置，要求抓紧时机作好秋收作物的选种、留种工作，为明年农业生产继续跃进，打下良好物质基础。
    浙江省除了要求开展一个群众性的选种运动外，还着重提出要认真总结和评选优良品种。共青团山西省委、山西省妇联和山西省农业厅发出联合通知，要求全省青年社员、妇女社员积极行动起来，开展一个比干劲、比速度、比质量的选种、采种热潮。全省在秋收前后，计划选留农作物种子七亿三千万斤，采集林木种子四千万斤。江苏省要求各地除了继续贯彻“自繁、自选、自留、自用”种子工作方针，保证按明年种植计划留足种子以外，同时还应抓紧良种收购工作。河南省不少地区根据领导机关的部署，已经积极行动起来。南乐县十二个人民公社都由书记挂帅，分片召开了选种现场会，交流了选种经验。目前这个县的选种工作已经全面展开，截至8月底止，块选了玉米一万五千亩，红薯一万四千亩，棉花一千五百亩，大豆一万八千亩。
