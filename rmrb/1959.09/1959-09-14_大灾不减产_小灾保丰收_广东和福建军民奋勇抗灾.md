Xinhua News Agency report:
Guangdong's eastern coastal areas have achieved significant victories in combating typhoons and rainstorms. Currently, areas continuing to experience rain and disaster are making every effort to combat floods, carry out emergency rescue work, and save flooded farmland.

The typhoon in the South China Sea made landfall at Shanwei Port in Haifeng County on the morning of the 11th. The wind force at the center of the typhoon reached level ten to eleven, and the wind force in affected areas such as Lufeng, Huiyang, Dongguan, and Baoan counties also reached levels six, seven, eight, and nine. Heavy rain and rainstorms occurred in the typhoon center and nearby areas. Within two days before and after the typhoon's impact, rainfall in various parts of the Shantou Special District generally exceeded 200 millimeters, with some areas reaching 300 millimeters. Due to the heavy rain brought by the typhoon and the sharp rise in sea tides, the discharge of river water was obstructed. The Han River, Rong River, and other major rivers in the Shantou Special District have now exceeded the highest water levels in the past two to thirty years, and hundreds of thousands of mu of rice fields have been affected by mountain floodwater and seawater inundation.

During the typhoon landfall, the masses in coastal counties, relying on the superiority of the People's Communes, and under the leadership of the Party, waged a tenacious battle against the typhoon and rainstorm, thereby greatly reducing losses. The people of Shanwei Fishing Port in Haifeng County, who were attacked by the center of the typhoon, under the personal command of the County Party Secretary, and after a staunch fight, ensured the safety of the lives and property of the fishing port residents. Huiyang County, which suffered severe flooding in June this year, in order to achieve the goal of regaining the year's grain production in the late rice crop, more than 200,000 people throughout the county fought heroically against this typhoon and rainstorm, ensuring that people, livestock, poultry, mountain ponds and reservoirs, 750,000 mu of rice, and all cash crops were not damaged in any way.

In this struggle against the rainstorm, the People's Communes demonstrated their great power. Before the typhoon arrived, People's Communes everywhere promptly organized a massive anti-typhoon force, forming various rescue teams, patrol teams, etc., assigning areas of responsibility to ensure everything was taken care of. After the typhoon made landfall, the communes and teams automatically cooperated with each other, assisting each other in repairing mountain ponds and reservoirs, and rescuing crops. Areas where the rainstorm has stopped are now making every effort to drain water, apply fertilizer, and rescue seedlings, to ensure the realization of the plan for exceeding production and increasing yields.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 13th: Nearly a million people are participating in flood fighting and disaster relief in the major river basins of the Jiulong River, Jin River, Ting River, Min River, and Mulan Creek in Fujian, as well as areas hit by rainstorms, bravely battling floods and rainstorms on the banks of various rivers and in disaster areas. The People's Liberation Army Air Force stationed locally dispatched aircraft, and the Navy dispatched boats, also joining the flood fighting and disaster relief efforts.

The typhoon that entered southern Fujian after making landfall on the eastern coast of Guangdong on the 11th had crossed eastern and northern Fujian on the morning of the 12th and entered Zhejiang Province. As the typhoon moved, the area affected by rainstorms quickly expanded from the Jiulong River and Jin River basins in southern Fujian to vast areas in the west and north. The Min River, Ting River, and their tributaries successively experienced flood peaks. As of noon on the 12th, with the passing of the typhoon, rainfall in various places had gradually decreased or stopped. However, apart from the flood peaks of the Jin River and small streams beginning to recede, due to widespread heavy rain in the vast mountainous areas of northern and western Fujian, the water levels of the middle and lower reaches of the Jiulong River and the middle and upper reaches of the Min River continued to rise. In the Zhangzhou City and Longxi County area in the lower reaches of the Jiulong River, the water level had risen to 12.75 meters by 12 noon, exceeding the warning line by 3.25 meters, making it the largest flood peak since 1908 (approximately 15.6 meters); the flood peaks of the Dazhang Creek and Sha Creek in the upper reaches of the Min River also exceeded the warning line by two to four meters. On the afternoon of the 12th, the floods from the tributaries of the Min River were converging into the Min River mainstream.

In southern and eastern Fujian, which were severely affected by rainstorms and floods, due to the heavy and prolonged rainfall, high flood peaks, and rapid onset, many sections of the dikes in the lower reaches of the Jiulong River overflowed, and large areas of farmland and towns were flooded. According to incomplete statistics from Longxi and Jinjiang Special Districts by the 12th, over 700,000 mu of farmland had been flooded. In Longxi Special District, during the flood peak and rainstorm attack, 21 people died, 194 were injured, more than 4,400 houses collapsed, and over 1,240 dikes, mountain ponds, reservoirs, etc., were washed away.

Currently, Fujian is in the peak growing season for late rice and other autumn grain crops, and large quantities of timber are gathered along the large and small rivers in the vast mountainous areas of northern and western Fujian. Therefore, Party committees and People's Communes at all levels have focused on protecting the lives and property of the people, striving for a bumper autumn grain harvest, and protecting timber, organizing the broad masses to launch a tenacious fight against the floods. In the lower reaches of the Jiulong River and Jin River and other severely affected areas, Party, government, military, and civilians are organizing various tools and manpower to go deep into the flooded areas to rescue the masses and recover materials. On the 11th, 700 to 800 people in Meixi Village, Jiuhu Commune, Longxi County, were trapped by floods. The Longxi County Party Committee immediately dispatched a deputy secretary, leading cadres, driving two motorboats and six wooden sailboats, to rush to the rescue, and had transferred all the people trapped by the floods to safe areas.

The Party committees and People's Communes at all levels in the vast mountainous areas of northern and western Fujian have put forward the fighting slogan of "Great disaster does not reduce production, small disaster ensures a good harvest," leading the masses to fully engage in the flood fighting effort centered on protecting autumn grain crops and timber. Thanks to the good organization of flood fighting by Party committees and People's Communes at all levels in these areas, as of the 12th, there had been no casualties in the Min River and Ting River basins, and other losses were also relatively small.

    大灾不减产　小灾保丰收
    广东和福建军民奋勇抗灾
    据新华社讯　广东东部沿海地区广大群众，在抗击台风、暴雨中获得重大胜利。目前，继续下雨和遭灾的地区，正在全力抗洪抢险和抢救受淹农田。
    南海上的台风，11日清晨在海丰县汕尾港登陆。台风中心风力达十级到十一级，被波及的陆丰、惠阳、东莞、宝安等县的风力，也在六级、七级、八级到九级。在台风中心和附近地区都降大雨和暴雨。汕头专区各地在台风侵袭前后两天内，普遍降雨二百毫米以上，多的达三百毫米。由于台风带来暴雨和海潮急剧上涨，江水下泄不畅，汕头专区的韩江、榕江等主要江河今天已超过了二、三十年来的最高水位，有几十万亩稻田已受山洪渍水和海潮淹浸。
    在台风登陆期间，沿海各县群众，依靠人民公社的优越性，在党的领导下，同台风暴雨进行了顽强的搏斗，因而大大减轻了损失。受台风中心袭击的海丰县汕尾渔港人民，在县委书记亲临前线指挥下，经过坚强的抗击，保障了渔港居民生命财产的安全。今年6月遭受严重水灾的惠阳县，为了实现晚造一造夺回全年粮的目标，全县二十多万人同这次台风暴雨进行了英勇的搏斗，使人、畜、家禽、山塘水库、七十五万亩水稻和全部经济作物都没有受到任何损失。
    在这次抗击暴风雨的斗争中，人民公社显示了强大的威力。台风到来之前，各地人民公社就及时地组织起抗风大军，组成各种抢险队，巡逻队等，分片包干，负责到底。台风登陆后，各公社队与队之间自动展开协作，互相协助抢修山塘、水库和抢救农作物。现在暴雨已经停息的地区正在全力进行排水追肥抢救禾苗，保证实现超产多收计划。
    据新华社福州13日电　福建九龙江、晋江、汀江、闽江、木兰溪等各主要江河流域和遭受暴雨袭击地区，目前已有近百万抗洪救灾大军，在各江河堤岸和灾区，同洪水暴雨展开了英勇的搏斗。驻在当地的人民解放军空军派出了飞机，海军派出了船艇，也投入了抗洪救灾斗争。
    11日由广东东部沿海登陆以后进入福建南部的台风，在12日早晨已越过福建东部和北部地区，转入浙江省。随着台风的转移，暴雨侵袭地区也由福建南部九龙江和晋江流域一带迅速扩及西部、北部广大地区，闽江、汀江和各支流先后出现洪峰。到12日中午止，随着台风过去，各地降雨量已逐渐减小或停止，但除晋江和小溪流洪峰开始退落外，由于闽北、闽西等广大山区先后普降暴雨，九龙江中下游、闽江中上游的水位仍在继续上涨。九龙江下游的漳州市和龙溪县一带，到12日中午十二点，水位已上涨到十二点七五米，超过警戒线三点二五米，是1908年（约十五点六米）以来最大的洪峰；闽江上游的大樟溪、沙溪洪峰也超过警戒线两米到四米多，12日下午闽江各支流的洪水，正向闽江干流汇集。
    受暴雨和洪水袭击较重的福建南部和东部地区，由于暴雨下得大，下得久，洪峰高，来势猛，防卫不及，九龙江下游不少堤段洪水漫堤，大片农田和城镇被淹，据龙溪和晋江两专区到12日止的不完全统计，受淹农田已达七十多万亩。龙溪专区在洪峰和暴雨袭击中，死亡二十一人，伤一百九十四人，倒塌房屋四千四百多间，冲垮堤岸、山塘、水库等一千两百四十多处。
    目前，福建各地正值晚稻等秋粮作物生长盛期，闽北闽西等广大山区的大小河边集结了大批待运木材，因此各级党委和人民公社都以保护人民生命财产、力争秋粮丰收和保护木材等为中心，组织广大群众展开了顽强的抗洪战斗。在九龙江和晋江下游等受灾较重的地区，党政军民组织各种工具和人力，深入受淹地区救护群众和抢救物资。11日龙溪县九湖公社梅溪村有七、八百人被洪水围困，中共龙溪县委立即派出副书记，带领干部，驾驶两条汽船、六条木帆船，赶往抢救，已把所有被洪水围困的人，转移到安全地带。
    福建北部和西部广大山区的各级党委和人民公社，提出了“大灾不减产，小灾保丰收”的战斗口号，领导群众全力投入以保护秋粮作物和木材为中心的抗洪斗争。由于这些地区各级党委和人民公社抗洪斗争组织得好，到12日止，闽江和汀江流域一带还没有发生人员伤亡事故，其他损失也较少。
