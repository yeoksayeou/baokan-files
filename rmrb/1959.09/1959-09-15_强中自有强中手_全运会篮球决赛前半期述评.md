There's Always Someone Stronger

Mid-Term Review of the National Games Basketball Finals

The First National Games basketball finals have completed half of their schedule as of the 14th. In the sixty-six games already played, the teams have not only demonstrated skilled passing techniques and diverse offensive and defensive tactics, but more gratifyingly, each team has shown soaring enthusiasm and strong fighting spirit, competing for every ball, and almost every game has been played at a high level.

Currently, a common saying on the court is "Unexpected Results." Indeed, it is difficult for anyone to predict who will win each basketball final before the game. In the first six rounds of competition, the defending champion of last year's Men's A League, the People's Liberation Army team, was defeated by the Hebei team, which was third in last year's A League; the Shanghai team, which was seventh in last year's Men's A League, defeated the Hebei team; however, the Shanghai team was defeated by the Sichuan team, which was eighth in last year's Men's A League, and the Guangdong team, which was the champion of last year's C League; the People's Liberation Army team, which was third in last year's Women's A League, was also defeated by the Hebei team, which was eighth in last year's Women's A League. Analyzing the scores of the sixty-six games, the technical levels of the teams are not far apart. There were fourteen games with a difference of five points or less, including three games with only a one-point difference (half a basket), and two games that extended to "overtime" to determine the winner. From the games, it can be seen that the so-called weak teams have become stronger after more than a year of training, truly reaching the point where "there's always someone stronger."

Not being discouraged by defeat and turning defeat into victory is another characteristic of this final. In some games, one side seemed to have the advantage midway through the game, but in the last few minutes, or even a few seconds, the other side turned the danger into safety and turned defeat into victory. The Sichuan women's team defeating the Guangdong women's team, the Jiangsu men's team defeating the Heilongjiang men's team, and the Sichuan, Guangdong, and Jiangsu men's teams defeating the Shanghai men's team were all such sudden changes. For example, the Shanghai men's team, which has four top athletes, had a 38 or 39-minute advantage in these three games, but was overturned in the last one or two minutes, turning victory into defeat. Especially in the match against the Guangdong men's team, technically speaking, the Guangdong team was still a C League team last year, with most of its players being second-level athletes. In terms of strength, they were certainly slightly inferior to the Shanghai men's team. However, the Guangdong men's team liberated their minds, broke superstitions, dared to adopt the "full-court press" tactic that so-called weak teams dare not use against strong teams, and valiantly fought off the Shanghai men's team's 39-minute advantage, forcing the opponent to play two more "overtime periods" and winning the final point. This example reveals that the key to turning defeat into victory lies in enthusiasm and fighting will.

In the first five rounds of the finals, in addition to comparing enthusiasm and fighting spirit, the teams also competed fiercely in intelligence and technique. Each team did not slack in the competition for rebounds to control the initiative. The men's teams had between 135 and 209 rebounds, and the women's teams had between 121 and 167 rebounds. Such close numbers are rare in previous competitions. In terms of offense and shooting, the numbers were also similar, with the men's teams averaging over 100 attacks per game and the women's teams around 100 attacks. The men's teams averaged 60 to 70 shots per game, and the women's teams averaged 40 to 50 shots, fully demonstrating the active, fast-paced style and characteristics of Chinese basketball. However, the shooting and free throw accuracy rates of the Beijing and Sichuan men's teams were higher. In the first five rounds of competition, the Beijing men's team made 176 shots out of 323 total attempts, with an accuracy rate of 54.4%, and made 101 free throws out of 143 attempts, with an accuracy rate as high as 70.6%. The Sichuan men's team made 159 shots out of 296 total attempts, with an accuracy rate of 53.7%, and the free throw accuracy rate also reached 67.5%. The shooting accuracy rate of the Shanghai men's team was only 39.9%, and the Hubei men's team was 37%. The accurate shooting of the Beijing and Sichuan men's teams laid the foundation for their victories in the first five days.

Currently, the twenty-four men's and women's teams participating in the finals have played five to six games (the entire schedule should be eleven games each). Only the Beijing men's and women's teams and the Sichuan men's team have maintained a perfect record of five wins and zero losses. The People's Liberation Army men's and women's teams have both won five out of six games, and the Sichuan women's team has won four out of five games. The Jiangsu men's team and the Shanghai women's team have four wins and two losses, and the Jilin men's and women's teams and the Hebei men's and women's teams have three wins and five losses. However, these teams will still face three or four strong teams in the future. With each team full of enthusiasm and the possibility of "unexpected results" arising, they still have hope of competing for the championship. ·Our Reporter·

    强中自有强中手
    全运会篮球决赛前半期述评
    第一届全国运动会篮球决赛整个赛程到14日已进行了一半。在已经举行的六十六场比赛中，各队不仅表现了娴熟的传球技巧和百花齐放的攻守战术，更可喜的是各队干劲冲天，斗志旺盛，每球必争，几乎场场打出了水平。
    目前在运动场上流传一句口头禅“出人意料”，的确，每场篮球决赛究竟是谁胜谁负，在赛前谁都难以预料。在前六轮的比赛中，去年的甲级男子队冠军解放军队被去年甲级队的第三名河北队打败了；去年甲级男子队第七名的上海队却胜了河北队；可是上海队又分别败给了去年甲级男子队第八名的四川队和去年丙级队冠军的广东队；去年甲级女子队第三名解放军队也被去年甲级女子队第八名河北队打败了。从六十六场的比分数字分析，各队的技术水平相差是不远的，比数相差五分以内的，共有十四场，其中有三场只差一分（半个球），有两场延长到“决胜期”才决定胜负的。从比赛中看到，所谓的弱队经过一年多锻炼已变得强了，真是到达了“强中自有强中手”的境地。
    败而不馁，转败为胜，是这次决赛中的另一个特点。有些场次，在比赛中途，眼看一方已占优势，可是到最后几分钟，甚至十几秒钟内，另一方却化险为夷，转败为胜，四川女队胜广东女队，江苏男队胜黑龙江男队，四川、广东、江苏三个男队分别胜上海男队等场，都是这样在瞬息之间来了个突然变化。例如拥有四个运动健将的上海男队在这三场比赛中，都是先占了三十八、九分钟的优势，可是就在最后一、两分钟中被对方翻了过去，反胜为败。特别是对广东男队一役，论技术说，广东队去年还是丙级队，大部分是二级运动员，论实力比上海男队当然要略逊一筹，可是广东男队思想解放，打破迷信，敢于采用所谓弱队对强队不敢采用的“全场紧逼”战术，斗志昂扬地打退了上海男队三十九分钟的优势，迫使对方再打两个“决胜期”，而获得最后一球之胜。这一事例，揭示了转败为胜的关键问题在于干劲和战斗意志。
    这次决赛的前五轮比赛，各队在比干劲、比斗志外，比智慧、比技术也是非常激烈。各队对掌握主动权的争夺篮板球都不松懈，男队在一百三十五次到二百零九次之间；女队在一百二十一次到一百六十七次之间，次数这样接近是历次比赛中少有的。在进攻和投篮方面，次数也相差不多，男队每场平均进攻一百次以上，女队也在一百次左右，男队投篮每场平均投六、七十次，女队投篮四、五十次，充分发挥了我国篮球运动积极主动、快速的风格和特点。但是北京、四川男队的投篮和罚球命中率较高。北京男队在头五轮比赛中总投三百二十三次，投中一百七十六次，命中率为54.4％，罚球一百四十三次，命中一百零一次，命中率高达70.6％。四川男队总投二百九十六次，投中一百五十九次，命中率为53.7％，罚球命中率也达67.5％。而上海男队的投篮命中率只有39.9％，湖北男队为37％，北京和四川男队的准确投篮，为他们在前五天取得胜利奠下了基础。
    目前，参加决赛的二十四个男、女队，已打过五场到六场（整个赛程应该各打十一场），其中只有北京男、女队和四川男队保持五战五胜不败的纪录，解放军男、女队都是六战五胜，四川女队是五战四胜。六战四胜的有江苏男队和上海女队，五胜三胜的有吉林男女队和河北男女队。但是这些队今后都还将与三、四个实力雄厚的队相遇，在各队干劲十足，都有可能出现“出人意料”的情况下，他们都还有争夺到冠军希望的。·本报记者·
