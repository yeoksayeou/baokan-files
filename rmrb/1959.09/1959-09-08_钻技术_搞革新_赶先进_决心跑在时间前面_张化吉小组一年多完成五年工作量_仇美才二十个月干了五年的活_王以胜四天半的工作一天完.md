Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th. The Zhang Huaji team in the forging and riveting workshop of the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, maintaining vigorous revolutionary drive and continuously innovating technology, had completed the workload of the second Five-Year Plan more than three years ahead of schedule by August 20th. Recently, they further revised their plan for increasing production and practicing economy, aiming to complete five months' worth of work in September alone, with all product quality meeting standards, and to fully utilize old materials, saving 35% more on materials such as coke and machine oil than planned, while ensuring no major or minor personal accidents or mechanical responsibility accidents.

During the first Five-Year Plan, the Zhang Huaji team completed five years' worth of work one year and nine months ahead of schedule. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, they completed two years and seven months' worth of work. Over the years, the Zhang Huaji team has adhered to putting politics in command, never being satisfied with the achievements already made. Each time they accept a production task, they formulate an advanced work plan, and continuously modify lagging indicators based on the implementation situation. While completing production tasks, they continuously innovate technology, improve processes, tools, and operating methods, and learn and promote advanced experience. Last year, this team innovated more than 110 technologies, and from January to August of this year, they innovated 71 more, increasing efficiency by one to more than 300 times, basically realizing mechanization in the team's production. This team not only greatly improved production efficiency but also basically eliminated defective products and rework, saved the country a large amount of steel by utilizing old and waste materials, and created a record of seven years and nine months of safe production, thus being rated as a provincial pace-setting team.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th.  Qiu Meicai, a young grinder at the Shanghai Tool Factory, completed five years and nine months' worth of work in the twenty months since the beginning of the second Five-Year Plan, while ensuring quality. Recently, after studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, he proposed to complete fifteen months' worth of work in nine to twelve months, responding to the Party Central Committee's call to battle.

In production, Qiu Meicai always mustered his energy, continuously innovated technology, and raced against time. This year, he has realized ten technological innovations, increasing production efficiency by one to fifty times respectively. During the battle of August, Qiu Meicai's production team received the task of producing a batch of "embedded blade-type machine hacksaw blades," with a quota of 800 pieces per day. Initially, some comrades in the team could only produce 400 pieces per day. Qiu Meicai then actively worked with apprentice Zhang Zeli to find a way to modify the table, improving production efficiency. Zhang Zeli, who originally produced only over 300 pieces per day, can now produce 168 pieces per hour. As a result, the entire team overfulfilled this task.

Qiu Meicai always proactively helped his surrounding comrades when they encountered difficulties in production. For example, when young apprentice Li Sudi received a new task, she was worried that she would not be able to complete it due to lack of technical proficiency. After Qiu Meicai learned about this, he quietly innovated a fixture on Li Sudi's machine and then asked Li Sudi to try it out. Li Sudi's output then increased by more than 460%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th.  The Wang Yisheng Youth Modeling Team of the Xuzhou Heavy Machinery Factory in Jiangsu completed seven years and six months' worth of work from January 1, 1958, to August 25, 1959, with an average product qualification rate of 99.955%.

This team has a total of 28 people, 26 of whom are young people. Their team has established a technical research group, specializing in studying technological innovations and promoting advanced experience. Each new product is researched in advance, and production methods are determined before production begins. When producing the bed of the C650 lathe, the technical research group studied the production method of this product in advance, changing from pouring sand in three sandboxes together to pouring sand in single sandboxes, and changing from single-layer sandboxes to double-layer sandboxes, ensuring the quality of the bed. When producing ductile iron large gears, team leader Wang Yisheng came up with the idea of using iron molds instead of sand molds based on the situation of cast steel, greatly improving modeling efficiency and ensuring product quality. This team came up with more than 240 technical creations and innovations in the year 1958 alone. This year, they had not produced a single defective product for more than four consecutive months. In August, when they were producing mine car wheels, they adopted the method of using water glass instead of quartz powder and pouring mud cores instead of brushing mud cores, which quickly increased the output of mine car wheels from 35 to 60 per day.

### 钻技术  搞革新  赶先进  决心跑在时间前面  张化吉小组一年多完成五年工作量  仇美才二十个月干了五年的活  王以胜四天半的工作一天完

    钻技术  搞革新  赶先进
    决心跑在时间前面
    张化吉小组一年多完成五年工作量  仇美才二十个月干了五年的活  王以胜四天半的工作一天完
    新华社长春7日电　吉林省农业机械厂锻铆车间张化吉小组，保持旺盛的革命干劲，不断革新技术，到8月20日为止，已经提前三年多完成了第二个五年计划期间的工作量。最近，他们进一步修订了增产节约计划，要在9月份一个月内完成五个月的工作量，产品质量全部达到标准，并且充分利用旧料，在焦炭机油等材料的使用上也要比计划节约35％，同时保证不出大小人身事故和机械责任事故。
    第一个五年计划期间，张化吉小组曾经提前一年零九个月完成了五年的工作量。在大跃进的1958年，一年完成了两年零七个月的工作量。几年来，张化吉小组坚持政治挂帅，永不满足已经取得的成绩。在每次接受生产任务时，都要制订出先进的作业计划，并且根据执行情况，不断修改落后指标。在完成生产任务时，他们不断革新技术，改进工艺、工具胎具和操作方法，学习和推广先进经验。去年这个小组革新技术一百一十多项，今年1月至8月份又革新技术七十一件，分别提高效率一倍到三百多倍，使小组生产基本上实现了机械化。这个小组不仅大大提高了生产效率，而且基本上消灭了废品和返修品，利用旧材废料给国家节约了大批钢材，创造了七年零九个月安全生产纪录，因此曾被评为全省的标兵小组。
    据新华社上海6日电　上海工具厂青年磨工仇美才，在进入第二个五年计划的二十个月内，做了五年九个月的工作量，并且保证了质量。最近，他学习了党的八届八中全会文件，提出要在九至十二个月内完成十五个月的工作量，响应党中央的战斗号召。
    仇美才在生产中，总是鼓足干劲，不断革新技术，分秒必争。今年他就实现了十项技术革新，生产效率分别提高一倍到五十倍。在大战8月的时候，仇美才生产小组接到生产一批“镶片套式机绞刀刀片”的任务，定额是一天生产八百片。开始，小组里有些同志一天只能生产四百片，仇美才便积极和学徒张泽励一起想办法改装了台面，提高了生产效率。张泽励本来一天只生产三百多片，现在一小时就能生产一百六十八片。结果，全组超额完成了这项任务。
    仇美才看到周围同志在生产中碰到了困难，总是主动地帮助。如青年学徒李素娣接到了一批新任务，由于技术不熟练，担心完不成，仇美才知道后，悄悄地在李素娣的机床上革新了一个夹具，然后要李素娣去试试。李素娣一试，产量便提高了460％以上。
    新华社南京6日电　江苏徐州市重型机械厂王以胜青年造型小组，从去年1月1日到今年8月25日完成了七年六个月的工作量，产品合格率平均达到99.955％。
    这个小组共有二十八人，其中有二十六人是青年。他们小组成立了技术研究组，专门负责研究技术革新和推广先进经验的工作，对每种新的产品都事先经过研究，确定生产方法以后才投入生产。在生产C“六五○”车床床身时，技术研究组事先就研究了这个产品的生产方法，将原来三个砂箱在一起翻砂，改为单件砂箱翻砂，将单层砂箱改为双层砂箱，保证了床身的质量。在生产球墨机大齿轮时，组长王以胜根据铸钢的情况，想出了用铁模代替砂模的办法，大大提高了造型效率，也保证了产品的质量。这个小组仅在1958年一年当中，就出现二百四十多件技术上的创造和革新。今年，他们曾经连续四个多月没有出过一件废品。8月份，他们生产矿车轮时，采取用玻璃水代替石英粉、用浇泥芯代替刷泥芯的办法，使矿车轮的产量由每天三十五个迅速提高到六十个。（附图片）
