Red Blossoms Everywhere
    ——A Review of the Performance Presented by Military Literary and Art Workers in Celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
    Chen Yading

In order to celebrate the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the military's literary and art workers, with immense excitement, and together with comrades on the national literary and art front, have contributed their precious artistic creations, displaying the brilliant artistic flowers cultivated by military literary and art workers under the strong leadership of the Party, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and inspired by the nationwide Great Leap Forward; thereby expressing the heartfelt wishes of military literary and art workers who love the motherland, love the Party, and love the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao.

The programs presented by the military in Beijing for this celebratory performance are mostly selected from the excellent programs of the Second All-Army Literary and Art Festival held in Beijing not long ago. There are thirteen evenings in total, including the dramas "Eastward Advance Overture," "Locust Tree Village," and "On the 38th Parallel," the operas "Red Eagle" and "Red Sun of Ke Mountain," the dance dramas "Five Red Clouds" and "Butterfly Lovers," song and dance performances by the General Political Department Cultural Troupe and the United Song and Dance Troupe, acrobatics performed by the United Acrobatic Troupe, and song and dance performances by amateur art performance teams.

The three dramas each have their own characteristics. "Eastward Advance Overture" (written by Gu Baozhang and Suo Yunping) correctly reflects the glorious achievements of the anti-Japanese national united front policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao through the struggle of the New Fourth Army behind enemy lines in northern Jiangsu. It successfully shapes the typical characters of our Party and our army and the die-hard faction of the Kuomintang. The plot is tense and moving, and the performance is full of national style. It is a good play with profound educational significance. "Locust Tree Village" (written by Hu Ke) successfully summarizes the tremendous development and changes in our country's rural areas under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao over the past ten years. The greatest feature of this play is the detailed and in-depth characterization of the characters, so that the audience, although the plot is relatively scattered, has a deep and unforgettable impression of the characters. The play "On the 38th Parallel" is not only of practical educational significance to us in exposing the conspiracy of the US-Lee war, but also enriches our knowledge of struggle.

The opera "Red Eagle" performed by the Combat Cultural Troupe is a masterpiece that combines revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The author, through a red seed left behind by the Red Army when it passed through the Gannan grassland - Lin Hua, a female political instructor of the Red Army health team, successfully shapes the heroic image of a communist who dedicated herself to the liberation struggle of the Tibetan people and was sincerely loved by the Tibetan people. The opera "Red Sun of Ke Mountain" is playwright Chen Qitong's gift to the National Day, and it took only more than three months from writing and rehearsal to performance. This is a very distinctive play, and it can be said that this play is a typical microcosm of the lives of the Tibetan people over the past ten years. In this play, the author has demonstrated skillful artistic techniques in characterization, dramatic structure, and the use of language, making the whole play closely captivating. Especially in terms of performance form, the author uses the traditional performance methods of national opera, and there are many creations worthy of attention.

The dance dramas "Five Red Clouds" and "Butterfly Lovers" are two programs that have already been well-known and loved by the vast audience. Dance drama is still a new art form for us. These two dance dramas demonstrate that the military's literary and art workers have exerted great creative spirit under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward. In particular, it is a good start to create dance dramas that express modern revolutionary struggle themes using their own national folk dances. Although some comrades still feel that they are not mature enough, it is unrealistic to demand that new art forms be as complete as traditional art forms that have been around for hundreds of years.

It is impossible to introduce all the song and dance programs one by one. The song and dance of the People's Liberation Army has always been known for its combativeness, mass character, national style, and military spirit. All the songs and dances presented in this celebratory performance are newly created. In a nutshell, it is "Leap Forward People Praise the Great Leap Forward." Judging from the content, it expresses the heroic spirit of the people of the motherland, who are full of vigor and high morale. Judging from the artistic form, it is "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," which is extremely encouraging. In particular, I would like to mention the programs of two amateur art performance teams. These are the essence selected from more than 4,000 programs generated by the mass amateur art activities of the troops in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. The richness of life content, the fullness of political enthusiasm, and the diversity of artistic forms are even beyond the reach of professional art troupes. In terms of acrobatics and Quyi programs, there are also many new creations, such as "Three-Person Bike Stunts," "Double Pole Climbing," and "Foot Juggling" in acrobatics, which can be called stunts, and "Yesterday" in crosstalk and "Good Qinghai" in Shulaibao, which can be called masterpieces in recent years.

In a word, there are red blossoms everywhere. These beautiful artistic flowers are all products of the Great Leap Forward since 1958. Therefore, everyone's common conclusion is: without the strong leadership of the Party, the resolute implementation of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," without the rain and sunshine provided by the Party's general line for socialist construction, without the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward, and without the military's literary and art workers going down to practice, closely contacting the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and taking the mass line, it would be impossible to create so many new and beautiful artistic works in such a short period of time. Let us congratulate the new achievements of the military's literary and art workers and congratulate them on the success of their celebratory performance.

    鲜花朵朵红
    ——评介部队文艺工作者庆祝建国十周年献礼演出
    陈亚丁
    为了庆祝伟大的建国十周年，部队的文艺工作者以万分兴奋的心情，和全国文艺战线上的战友们一起，贡献出了自己艺术创作的珍品，展示出了部队文艺工作者在党的坚强领导下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国大跃进的鼓舞下，所培植出来的绚烂的艺术花朵；以此表达部队文艺工作者热爱祖国，热爱党，热爱全国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的心愿。
    部队此次来京参加献礼演出的节目，绝大部分都是从不久前在京举行的全军第二届文艺会演的优秀节目中选拔出来的，共有话剧“东进序曲”、“槐树庄”、“三八线上”，歌剧“红鹰”、“柯山红日”，舞剧“五朵红云”、“蝶恋花”，总政治部文工团和联合歌舞团演出的歌舞，联合杂技团演出的杂技、业余文艺演出队演出的歌舞等十三个晚会。
    三个话剧各有特点。“东进序曲”（顾宝璋、所云平编剧）通过新四军在苏北敌后的斗争，正确地体现了党中央和毛主席所制定的抗日民族统一战线政策的光辉成就，成功地塑造了我党我军和国民党顽固派方面的典型人物，情节紧张动人，演出富有民族风格，是一出具有深刻教育意义的好戏。“槐树庄”（胡可编剧）成功地概括了我国农村在党和毛主席的领导下，十年来巨大的发展和变化。这出戏的最大特点是对人物的细致深入的刻划，使观众看后，虽然情节比较分散，但人物的印象却是深刻难忘的。“三八线上”这出戏不仅在揭露美李战争阴谋方面，对我们有现实教育意义，也丰富我们的斗争知识。
    战斗文工团演出的歌剧“红鹰”，是一出革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的佳作，作者通过红军长征过甘南草原时留下的一颗红色的种子——红军卫生队女政治指导员林华，成功地塑造了为藏族人民的解放斗争献身，为藏族人民衷心地爱戴的共产党人的英雄形象。歌剧“柯山红日”是剧作家陈其通向国庆的献礼，从写作、排练到演出，历时不过三个多月。这是一出很有特色的戏，可以说这部戏是西藏人民十年来生活的典型化的缩影。作者在这出戏中，无论在刻划人物，戏剧结构，运用语言等方面，都表现了熟练的艺术技巧，使全剧紧紧扣人心弦。特别是在表现形式方面，作者运用了民族戏曲传统的表现方法，有许多值得重视的创造。
    舞剧“五朵红云”和“蝶恋花”，是两个已为广大观众所熟知所喜爱的节目。舞剧对我们来讲还是一种新生的艺术形式。这两个舞剧，表现了部队文艺工作者在大跃进的鼓舞下，发挥了极大的创造精神。特别是用自己的民族民间舞蹈，创作表现现代革命斗争题材的舞剧，这是一个良好的开端，尽管有些同志还觉得她们不够成熟，但要求新生的艺术形式就像几百年的传统艺术形式那样完整，是很不现实的。
    歌舞节目不可能一一介绍。解放军的歌舞历来是以战斗性、群众性和民族风格、部队气魄著称的。这次献礼演出的全部歌舞都是新创作，总括一句话是“跃进人颂大跃进”，从内容看表现了祖国人民意气风发，斗志昂扬的英雄气概，从艺术形式看是“百花齐放、推陈出新”，对人有极大的鼓舞力量。其中特别要提到两个业余文艺演出队的节目，这是从1958年部队群众性业余文艺活动大跃进产生的四千多个节目中挑选出来的精华，生活内容的充实，政治热情的饱满，艺术形式的多样，甚至为专业文艺团体所不及。在杂技曲艺节目方面，也有许多新的创作，如杂技中的“三人车技”、“双爬竿”、“蹬技等，”均堪称绝技，曲艺中的相声“昨天”，数来宝“青海好”等，都堪称近年来的佳作。
    总之一句话，是鲜花朵朵红。这些美丽的艺术花朵都是1958年以来大跃进的产物，因此，大家共同的一条结论是：没有党的坚强领导，坚决贯彻执行党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的政策，没有党的建设社会主义总路线给予雨露阳光，没有大跃进的鼓舞，没有部队文艺工作者下放锻炼，密切联系工农兵群众，走群众路线，在短期内创作出这样多又新又美的艺术作品来是不可能的。让我们祝贺部队的文艺工作者的新成就，祝贺他们献礼演出成功。
