Xinhua News Agency, September 8th. Our correspondent Wang Yuanjing reports: With only five days until the opening of the First National Games, more than 1,200 male and female track and field athletes, representing more than twenty ethnic groups and twenty-nine units from across the country, have gathered in Beijing, ready to showcase their skills at the Games, which begin on the 13th.

The track and field competition will be held in the newly completed Beijing Workers' Stadium. The number of participants exceeds the number of participants in the largest previous National Track and Field Championships in 1957 (760 people) by more than 50%. Among the athletes, more than 10% have achieved the standard of master athletes, nearly a hundred are national record holders or creators of new national achievements, and most of the others are rising stars. The average age of the athletes is twenty-one and a half years old, including fourteen-year-old youngsters and forty-year-old veterans. It's truly a gathering of heroes, with talented individuals as numerous as clouds.

Due to the large number of participating athletes and competition events (a total of forty-two individual events for men and women), the competition time will also be longer than in previous years, lasting a total of ten days (until the 22nd). All fifteen field events (throwing and jumping events) for men and women will first hold "qualifying rounds" to eliminate most of the athletes, with only the twelve or sixteen athletes with the highest levels in each event participating in the preliminary rounds and finals. In track events, the men's 100-meter and 200-meter races have the most participants (eighty-three people), and will go through four stages of preliminary rounds, heats, semi-finals, and finals to determine who is the fastest runner in the country. Other events such as the men's 110-meter hurdles, 200-meter low hurdles, 400-meter, and women's 100-meter, 200-meter, and 80-meter low hurdles will also hold preliminary rounds, semi-finals, and finals.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, track and field athletes across the country have seen widespread and rapid improvements in their performances during the training boom in preparation for the National Games. Many events have seen the emergence of batches of evenly matched top athletes. According to incomplete statistics, in the first eight months of this year alone, more than fifty track and field athletes have broken twenty-six national records about one hundred times. That is to say, almost two-thirds of all forty-three national track and field records have been broken during this period. Therefore, it is expected that this track and field competition will be conducted at a much higher level than in previous years, and athletes from all over the country will raise the level of track and field in our country to a new peak during the fierce competition.

According to the current performance of athletes from various regions, the men's track events and the jumping events in the field events will see more captivating competitions. For example, in the 100-meter race, which will be held on September 15th, at least twenty of the eighty-three athletes are likely to complete the race in under eleven seconds. Most of the top performers in the men's high jump (final on the 19th) are newcomers. Shi Hongfan, an eighteen-year-old from Shandong, recently cleared 2.02 meters, breaking the national record of 2.01 meters held by Ma Xianglong from Yunnan. In the women's high jump, former world record holder Zheng Fengrong will face a group of athletes whose current performances are similar to hers. Yang Meiru, an eighteen-year-old from Beijing, recently cleared 1.65 meters. Guo Naining and Dong Yisheng from Beijing, Zhang Jingying from Guangdong, Wu Shangzhi from Fujian, Yu Nali from Sichuan, Ye Qing from Shanghai, and Wang Jianxia from Liaoning all have scores around 1.60 meters.

### 田径健儿云集首都  一千二百名运动员准备大显身手

    田径健儿云集首都
    一千二百名运动员准备大显身手
    据新华社8日讯　本社记者王元敬报道：距离第一届全国运动会开幕只有五天了，包括二十多个民族、代表全国二十九个单位的一千二百多名男、女田径运动员，已经云集北京，准备在13日开始的全运会上大显身手。
    这次田径比赛将在新落成的北京工人体育场举行。参加的人数超过了在这以前规模最大的1957年全国田径运动会参加人数（七百六十人）的50％多。运动员中，有10％以上成绩达到运动健将标准，近百名是田径全国纪录保持者或全国新成绩创造者，其他大部分都是后起之秀。运动员的平均年龄是二十一岁半，其中有十四岁的小将，也有四十岁的老将。真是群英聚会，好手如云。
    由于参加竞赛的选手和竞赛项目（男、女共四十二个单项）众多，这次竞赛的时间也比往年长，共将举行十天（到二十二日止），其中男、女全部十五个田赛项目（投掷和跳跃项目），都将先举行“及格赛”淘汰掉大部分选手，每项剩十二名或十六名水平更高的选手再参加预赛和决赛。在径赛方面，男子一百米和二百米参加的人数最多（八十三人），将通过预赛、次赛、复赛和决赛四个阶段，才能决定谁是全国跑得最快的人。其他如男子一百一十米高栏、二百米低栏、四百米和女子一百米、二百米、八十米低栏，也都将举行预赛、复赛和决赛。
    自从大跃进的1958年以来，全国各地的田径选手在迎接全运会的锻炼热潮中，成绩又有了普遍的、快速的提高，许多项目都涌现了成批势均力敌的高手，据不完全统计，在今年的头八个月中，就有五十多名田径选手约一百次打破了二十六项全国纪录，就是说，全部四十三项田径全国纪录几乎有三分之二在这一时期被打破。因而预计这次田径比赛将在大大高于往年的水平上进行，各地选手在激烈的争夺中，将会把我国的田径运动水平提到新的高峰。
    根据目前各地选手的成绩来看，这次男子的径赛项目和田赛中的跳跃项目，将出现更多的引人入胜的竞赛场面。例如将在9月15日举行决赛的一百米赛跑，八十三名选手中至少有二十名选手可能在十一秒以内跑完全程。男子跳高（决赛19日举行）成绩好的大多是新手，山东十八岁的史鸿范不久以前跳过了两米零二，突破了云南选手马翔龙保持的两米零一的全国纪录，女子跳高方面，前世界纪录保持者郑凤荣这次将要遇到一批和她目前成绩相差不多的选手。北京十八岁的杨美如不久以前跳过了一米六十五，北京的郭乃莹、董沂生，广东的张晶莹，福建的吴尚治，四川的虞娜丽，上海的叶青，辽宁的王剑侠，成绩都达到了一米六十上下。
