    Supporting the Spanish People's Movement for Amnesty of Political Prisoners
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    In recent times, a movement to win "amnesty for all imprisoned and exiled political prisoners" has been widely launched throughout Spain. This movement was initiated by the Spanish Communist Party a few months ago, when the Franco regime intensified its suppression of democratic forces in Spain. The Spanish Communist Party called on all domestic democratic parties to take joint action and unite the people of the whole country to launch a common struggle against the dictatorial rule; to strive for the restoration of all democratic freedoms and rights, and to grant amnesty to imprisoned and exiled political prisoners.
    This call of the Spanish Communist Party has received enthusiastic responses at home and abroad; the nationwide movement to win amnesty for political prisoners and exiled political prisoners has rapidly developed to every corner of Spain, which fully shows that the call of the Spanish Communist Party reflects the wishes of the Spanish people and the moral forces of the world.
    Twenty years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime's prisons still hold thousands of political prisoners. According to Spanish official statistics, the total number of political prisoners is more than 18,400; while other news from Spain says that at least 200,000 patriots are imprisoned. Among them, 2,000 people have been tortured for fifteen to twenty years in the dark and hopeless prison cells by the Franco regime's torture and interrogation. The reason why these political prisoners were thrown into prison is only because they contributed their strength to fight for the freedom and happiness of the Spanish people and the independence and dignity of Spain. In addition, on the same charge, thousands of Spanish patriots have been deprived of the right to live freely in their own country and have to live in exile abroad.
    This spring, more than one million people in Spain signed a petition requesting amnesty for political prisoners. Not long ago, more than one hundred well-known scientists, philosophers, writers, journalists and artists, including the president of the Royal Spanish Academy, jointly wrote to the government requesting amnesty; and said: In no way can it be said that the fact that thousands of Spaniards are unable to participate in national life because they are closed in prisons or forced to live in exile abroad is reasonable. The World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students called on all their organizations to use all means to demand that the Franco government immediately pardon all prisoners and those who have fled abroad. In many countries, people have held rallies and issued statements, seriously protesting against the Spanish authorities' actions of suppressing human freedom, and resolutely demanding that the Franco government release and pardon all Spanish political prisoners and end their suffering from prison and exile for many years.
    In the face of the Spanish people's increasingly strengthened resistance movement, the Franco government has intensified its persecution measures. On July 28 this year, it forced the parliament to pass a new law on so-called "social order." According to this law, the police can arbitrarily persecute all those who participate in strikes, and the Minister of the Interior has the right to order the army to "rectify order" when "necessary." The law also stipulates that when the civil authorities cannot suppress the movement of the masses, martial law can be imposed or a "state of war" can be declared in all or part of the territory. This law is actually a signal for further persecution of democratic forces in Spain. Soon after, the Spanish authorities arrested a large number of democrats, intellectuals, university students and workers, and attempted to murder Simon Sanchez Montero, a member of the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party, a loyal son of the Spanish people.
    However, democratic forces cannot be eliminated by any persecution. More and more Spanish people have joined the struggle against terrorist activities. A national movement to restore all democratic freedoms and rights, and to grant amnesty to political prisoners and political exiles is continuing to develop with greater momentum than before. We Chinese people express our deep sympathy for the just struggle of the Spanish people. We firmly protest against the inhuman persecution actions taken by the Spanish authorities and demand the Franco government's amnesty for all political prisoners imprisoned and exiled abroad.

    声援西班牙人民争取大赦政治犯的运动
    本报评论员
    近一个时期以来，争取“大赦所有被囚禁和流亡在外的政治犯”的运动，在西班牙全国广泛展开。这个运动是西班牙共产党在几个月以前、佛朗哥政权变本加厉地对西班牙民主力量进行镇压的时候发起的。西班牙共产党号召国内各民主政党采取联合行动、团结全国人民展开反独裁统治的共同斗争；争取恢复一切民主自由权利，大赦被囚禁的政治犯和流亡在外的政治犯。
    西班牙共产党的这个号召，在国内外获得了热烈的响应；全国规模的争取大赦政治犯和流亡在外的政治犯的运动，迅速发展到西班牙境内的各个角落，这充分表明西共的号召反映了西班牙人民和世界道义力量的意愿。
    在西班牙内战结束二十年以后的今天，佛朗哥政权的监狱里还囚禁着成千上万的政治犯。据西班牙官方材料统计，政治犯的总数在一万八千四百名以上；而来自西班牙的另外的消息说，被囚禁的爱国者至少有二十万名。其中二千人已在暗无天日的牢房中，被佛朗哥政权的酷刑和审讯折磨了十五到二十个年头。这些政治犯之所以被投进监狱，仅仅是由于他们为争取西班牙人民的自由和幸福以及西班牙的独立和尊严贡献过自己的力量。此外，基于同样的罪名，还有数以千计的西班牙爱国者，被剥夺了在国内自由生活的权利而不得不流亡国外。
    今年春天，在西班牙，已有一百多万人签名要求赦免政治犯。不久以前，一百多位著名的科学家、哲学家、作家、新闻记者和艺术家，其中包括皇家语言学会主席联名上书政府要求实行大赦；并且说：在任何方面也不能说明，数以千计的西班牙人由于被关闭在监狱中或者被迫流亡在国外而不能参加国家生活这一事实是合理的。世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会号召它们的所有组织，用一切办法，要求佛朗哥政府立即赦免一切囚犯和逃亡国外的人。在许多国家中，人们纷纷举行集会和发表声明，严重抗议西班牙当局这种压制人类自由的行为，并坚决要求佛朗哥政府释放和赦免全体西班牙政治犯，结束他们许多年来由于监狱和流亡生活所受的苦难。
    面对着西班牙人民日益加强的反抗运动，佛朗哥政府加紧了迫害措施。今年7月28日，它使议会强行通过一项关于所谓“社会秩序”的新法律。根据这项法律，警察可以任意迫害所有参加罢工的人，内政部长有权在“必要时”命令军队去“整顿秩序”。法律还规定，在民政当局镇压不了人民群众的运动时，可以在全部或部分领土上实行戒严或者宣布“战争状态”。这项法律实际上是进一步迫害西班牙民主力量的一个信号。不久以后，西班牙当局就大批逮捕民主人士、知识分子、大学生和工人，并且企图谋害西班牙人民忠实的儿子西共政治局委员西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗。
    然而，民主力量是任何迫害都消灭不了的，愈来愈多的西班牙人民投入了反抗恐怖活动的斗争，一个争取恢复一切民主自由权利、大赦政治犯和政治流放犯的全国运动，正在以较前更大的声势继续发展。我们中国人民对西班牙人民的正义斗争表示深切情。我们坚决抗议西班牙当局采取的不人道的迫害行动，要求佛的关怀和同朗哥政府大赦被监禁和流亡在外全体政治犯。
