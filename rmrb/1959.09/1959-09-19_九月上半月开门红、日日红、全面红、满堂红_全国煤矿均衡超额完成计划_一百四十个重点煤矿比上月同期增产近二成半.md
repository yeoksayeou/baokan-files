Xinhua News Agency, 18th - The workers of 140 key coal mines across the country completed the state plan in a balanced and comprehensive manner in the first half of September, showing a new atmosphere of a flying start, daily red, all-round red, and complete red.

　　This new atmosphere emerged under the encouragement of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Responding to the call of the Party Central Committee, coal mine workers across the country entered September and launched a mass movement against right-leaning tendencies, to boost morale, and to continue the Great Leap Forward, setting off friendly competitions in various forms such as "opponent competitions," "cooperation competitions," and "one-dragon competitions." Therefore, even though the coal production plan for September was significantly increased compared to July and August, the daily production plan was still overfulfilled every day. In the first half of the month, the coal output of 140 key coal mines increased by 24.36% compared to the same period in August, and 35.79% compared to the same period in July, changing the past situation where production was often slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end.

　　Among the key coal mines in 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, 21 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions overfulfilled the total output plan for the first half of the month, with coal production accounting for more than 98.47% of the total output of key coal mines in these 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The bureaus and mines under the jurisdiction of nine provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Hubei, Guangxi, Yunnan, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Beijing, all completed the production plans for the first half of the month.

　　In terms of tunneling, stripping, and coal washing, most coal mines have achieved comprehensive improvement. The average daily footage of tunneling in 42 large coal mines across the country in the first half of September increased by 12.8% compared to the same period in August; the average daily footage of main roadways increased by 7.5% compared to the same period in August; and open-pit coal mine stripping increased by 32% compared to the same period in August. The 18 key coal washing plants, which are responsible for supplying the needs of large steel plants across the country, also overfulfilled the plan for coal washing output in the first half of the month by 3.8%, and created the highest record for daily coal washing output in Chinese history on the 9th and 10th.

　　Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry instructed all coal mines to continue to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, earnestly summarize the experience of developing the coal industry at high speed, consolidate and develop the achievements of August and September, promptly arrange for maintenance, transportation, and the lives of workers during the National Day holiday, and conscientiously prepare for production, in order to offer better production results as a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

    九月上半月开门红、日日红、全面红、满堂红
    全国煤矿均衡超额完成计划
    一百四十个重点煤矿比上月同期增产近二成半
    新华社18日讯　全国一百四十个重点煤矿的职工9月上半月均衡、超额地完成了国家计划，出现了开门红、日日红、全面红、满堂红的新气象。
    这种新气象是在中共八届八中全会公报和决议鼓舞下出现的。全国煤矿职工响应党中央的号召，进入9月，开展了反右倾、鼓干劲、继续跃进的群众运动，掀起“对手赛”、“协作赛”、“一条龙竞赛”等多种形式的友谊竞赛。因此在9月份煤炭生产计划比7、8月都有大幅度增长的情况下，日生产计划仍都天天超额完成。上半月一百四十个重点煤矿的煤炭产量比8月同期提高24.36％，比7月同期提高35.79％，改变了过去往往是月初松月末紧的情况。
    在全国二十四个省、市、自治区所属重点煤矿中，有二十一个省、市、自治区上半月都超额完成了总产量计划，所产煤炭占二十四个省、市、自治区所属重点煤矿总产量的98.47％以上。河北、辽宁、吉林、湖北、广西、云南、青海、宁夏、北京等九个省、市、自治区所属局矿，都全部完成了上半月生产计划。
    在掘进、剥离、洗煤等方面，绝大部分煤矿都作到全面提高。全国四十二个大型煤矿9月上半月的掘进平均日进尺，比8月同期增长12.8％；主要巷道平均日进尺比8月同期提高7.5％；露天煤矿剥离比8月同期提高32％。担负着供应全国大型钢铁厂需要的十八个重点洗煤厂，上半月洗煤产量也超额3.8％完成了计划，在9、10两日还创造了中国历史上洗煤日产量的最高纪录。
    最近，煤炭工业部又指示各煤矿继续深入贯彻中共八届八中全会精神，认真总结高速度发展煤炭工业的经验，巩固和发展8、9两月的成就，及时安排好国庆节期间的检修、运输和职工生活等问题，认真作好生产准备工作，以更好的生产成绩向建国十周年献礼。
