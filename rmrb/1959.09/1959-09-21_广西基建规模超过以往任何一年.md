Xinhua News Agency, Nanning -- In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 110 industrial capital construction projects of various sizes are either under construction or have commenced. Among them, over 50 projects are scheduled for completion before National Day.

This year, the scale of industrial capital construction in Guangxi has exceeded any previous year. In the first eight months, the region's capital construction workload increased by 84.9% compared to the same period last year, with industrial capital construction increasing by 231.5%.

To ensure that these industrial "new recruits" are put into operation as soon as possible, the autonomous region's capital construction departments, adhering to the principle of concentrating resources and ensuring key projects, are prioritizing key projects in iron and steel, coal, electricity, sugar refining, and other light industries that can be quickly completed and put into production this winter and next spring. In the iron and steel industry, the civil engineering and installation work for the No. 1 blast furnace with a volume of 255 cubic meters at the Liuzhou Iron and Steel Plant is mostly completed; the Luzhai Iron Smelting Plant is undergoing expansion. In the coal industry, regular mine construction is currently underway at the Heshan, Dongluo, Xiwang, Tunli, Yangliu, and Daqing coal mines. The five pairs of inclined and vertical shafts being built at the Heshan Coal Mine will be completed or put into production separately around National Day and at the end of the year. The three pairs of new shafts at the Tunli Coal Mine are also nearing completion. In the power industry, there are more than ten projects, including the Xijin Hydropower Station with an installed capacity of 288,000 kilowatts, and the Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Guilin, and Jinchengjiang thermal power plants. The Nanning and Wuzhou thermal power plants have already been completed and put into production. The newly built Nanning Sugar Refinery, with a daily processing capacity of 2,000 tons, has mostly completed its civil engineering work and is currently installing equipment. Six medium-sized mechanized sugar refineries are also under intense construction. After these sugar refineries are completed and put into production this winter and next spring, the region's mechanized sugar production capacity will increase by 85% compared to last year. In addition, the Guilin Cotton Textile Factory, with 40,000 spindles, is also under construction.

Currently, construction and installation enterprise workers across the region are widely engaged in a production increase and economy drive to ensure the timely completion of industrial capital construction projects.

    广西基建规模超过以往任何一年
    新华社南宁电　广西僮族自治区有一百一十多个大大小小的工业基本建设工程正在继续施工或开工兴建，其中有五十多项工程将在国庆节前夕建成。
    今年，广西工业基本建设的规模超过了以往任何一年。头八个月，全区基本建设工程量比去年同期增长84.9％，其中工业基本建设工程量比去年同期增长了231.5％。
    为了使工业“新兵”早日上阵，自治区基本建设部门本着集中力量、保证重点的原则，首先抓紧了今冬明春可以迅速建成投入生产的钢铁、煤炭、电力、制糖和其他轻工业等方面的重点工程。钢铁工业方面，柳州钢铁厂的二百五十五立方米一号高炉的土建和安装工程，大部分已经完毕；鹿寨炼铁厂正在扩建。煤炭工业方面，目前进行正规矿井建设的有合山、岽罗、西湾、屯里、杨柳、大青等煤矿。合山煤矿兴建的五对斜井和竖井，将分别在国庆节和年底建成或投入生产。屯里煤矿新建的三对矿井，也快要建成。在电力工业方面，有装机容量二十八万八千瓩的西津水电站，和南宁、柳州、梧州、桂林、金城江火力发电站等共十多处。南宁、梧州两个火力发电站已经建成投入生产。新建的日榨两千吨的南宁糖厂，大部分土建工程已经完成，正在安装设备。六个中型机制糖厂也在紧张兴建。这些糖厂在今冬明春建成投入生产以后，全区机制糖的生产能力将比去年增加85％。此外，四万纱锭的桂林棉纺厂，也正在兴建。
    目前，全区各地的建筑安装企业职工正在普遍展开增产节约竞赛运动，以确保工业基建工程如期完工。
