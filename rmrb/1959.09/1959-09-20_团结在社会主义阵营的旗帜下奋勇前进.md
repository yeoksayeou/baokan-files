    Advance Bravely Under the Banner of the Socialist Camp
    Zhang Xiangshan, Ye Huosheng, Liu Keming
    The unity of socialist countries is growing stronger, and the strength of the socialist camp is developing day by day.
    Ten years ago, the People's Republic of China was founded, marking the victory of the New Democratic Revolution of the Chinese people. This great victory of historical significance was achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong through a long and heroic struggle, and with the support of international revolutionary forces.

    At the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, representing the will of the people of the whole country, declared to the world that we must first unite with the Soviet Union and all People's Democratic countries. This means that liberated China has since joined the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    China's participation in the socialist camp is the inevitable product of the development of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. This is because the Chinese people share a long-standing revolutionary friendship with the people of other socialist countries, especially with the Soviet people. In our socialist countries, the working people have mastered political power, Marxism-Leninism is our common guiding ideology, building communism is our common great ideal, and proletarian internationalism and equal, comradely mutual assistance are the common principles governing our relations. We need to support each other and exchange experiences in building socialism and communism; we need to support each other and fight with one heart and one mind in defending the fruits of the revolution and opposing imperialism. These common ideals and common interests closely link our country with all socialist countries. As is well known, this socialist camp is headed by the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the first country to realize the proletarian revolution and build socialism. Its strength is the greatest, its experience is the richest, and it enjoys the highest prestige in the hearts of the people of the world.

    China, an Eastern country with a population of over 600 million, resolutely joined the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union after breaking away from the capitalist system, and opposed the imperialist aggression camp. This greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, the population of the socialist camp countries accounted for more than one-third of the world's total, and the territory accounted for more than one-quarter. It stretched across Eurasia, forming a single piece, echoing each other from east to west, and ending the old situation of imperialism surrounding the socialist world. This has brought about a tremendous change in the balance of power in the world, which is favorable to socialist countries.

    Lenin foresaw the great significance of the Chinese people's liberation struggle as early as 1923. He said: "The outcome of the struggle depends in the final analysis on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., constitute the overwhelming majority of the world's population. It is this majority of the population that has been very rapidly drawn into the struggle for its own liberation in recent years. Therefore, in this sense, there can be no doubt whatsoever about the final solution of the world struggle. In this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed." It is precisely in this sense that the victory of our country's new democratic revolution must be regarded as another great victory achieved by mankind after the victory of the Russian October Revolution.

    The Chinese revolution is a part of the world socialist revolution led by the proletariat. Therefore, after completing the new democratic revolution, the Chinese Communist Party immediately pushed the revolution forward, realized the socialist revolution, and is now advancing at the highest speed on the broad road of building socialism.

    The victory of China's New Democratic Revolution, in terms of international conditions, relied on the support of the Soviet Union and the international revolutionary forces. Conversely, the Chinese people strengthened the strength of the socialist camp with their own victory. In the process of carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction in China, our country has obtained the assistance of the socialist camp on a larger scale. Conversely, our people also use their own revolutionary struggle and greater achievements to continuously strengthen the strength of the socialist camp and constantly consolidate the unity of the socialist camp. The ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been ten years in which the unity between our country and the Soviet Union and all socialist countries has been continuously strengthened, and it has also been ten years in which the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been developing day by day.

    The exchange of revolutionary and construction experiences among fraternal countries has greatly enriched the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism.

    Marxism-Leninism is the ideological foundation of the unity of socialist countries. All socialist countries follow the universal laws of Marxism-Leninism to carry out socialist revolution and build socialism. At the same time, in the process of applying universal laws to the practice of their own countries, all socialist countries are constantly creating new experiences to enrich the general treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. These experiences have become the most valuable support for each other.

    China is a country that achieved revolutionary victory and carried out socialist construction relatively late. Therefore, the advanced revolutionary and construction experiences of every fraternal country, especially the experience of the Soviet Union, the first socialist country, have immeasurable significance for our country's revolution and construction. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly called on the whole party and the people of the whole country to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union. He said: "The Soviet people have accumulated extremely rich experience in the struggle of socialist revolution and the long-term process of socialist and communist construction. This experience is a great treasure for the working people of the world. The Chinese people have learned many valuable things from the Soviet Union in the past revolutionary struggle and in the current cause of building socialism. In the future, the Chinese people will continue to strengthen their study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in order to accelerate China's socialist construction."

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated in its political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "Although our country's revolution has many of its own characteristics, the Chinese Communists regard the cause they are engaged in as a continuation of the great October Revolution."

    The advanced experience of other fraternal countries is also of great significance and has given us very beneficial support. Because some fraternal countries have similar national conditions to our country, or because some fraternal countries are in the same revolutionary stage as our country, in this case, the experience of fraternal countries is particularly beneficial to us.

    Not only positive experiences are of great significance, but also negative experiences are instructive. It can prevent us from repeating mistakes and avoid or take fewer detours.

    The exchange of advanced experiences is one of the sources of strength for our victorious struggle. It is impossible to imagine that without the general treasure house of Marxism-Leninism enriched by the struggle experience of fraternal countries to draw strength from, our country's socialist construction cause would have achieved such great achievements in these ten years. It is these experiences that have helped us develop smoothly, helped us foresee the major obstacles that will be encountered in the construction cause, and enable us to formulate preventive measures; helped us to discover errors and shortcomings in time during the course of our cause and thoroughly correct them. From this, it can be seen that the major achievements made by the Chinese people in building socialism over the past ten years are inextricably linked to the achievements of the people of fraternal countries.

    While fully estimating that our country's socialist construction cause draws strength and support from the advanced experience of fraternal countries, it must also be seen that the important experience accumulated by the 600 million people of our country in building socialism has also greatly enriched the general treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and plays an active role in the revolutionary and construction cause of fraternal countries. Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical summary of our country's revolutionary and construction experience belongs to this nature. They are incorporated into the general treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and become a common valuable asset. This is the obligation and contribution that our party has made in international experience exchange and mutual assistance among fraternal countries.

    The universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which is enriched and continuously developed by the experience of socialist revolution and socialist construction, cannot be combined with the practice of the country, and then this country cannot have the victory of the proletarian revolution and the victory of socialist construction and the transition to communism. Dogmatists attempt to separate the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism from specific practice and turn it into a solidified and dead principle, which not only hinders the development of Marxist-Leninist theory, but also makes it impossible to make due contributions to the common cause of the international proletariat. Therefore, the Communist Party of China has struggled to overcome dogmatism. But it must be pointed out that revisionism, as a bourgeois ideology, is more dangerous than dogmatism. Revisionists deny the great role and necessity of the leadership of the Communist Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat during the transition period, and try to corrode the revolutionary soul of Marxism. They are the most vicious revolutionary traitors who have penetrated into the ranks of the proletariat, and are the most dangerous enemies of the current international communist movement. The Communist Party of China, together with fraternal parties, has waged a resolute struggle against the modern revisionism of Yugoslavia in order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to defend the fraternal unity of socialist countries. After this struggle of right and wrong, the face of the Yugoslav leadership group willingly serving American imperialism is now clear to the world.

    The Sino-Soviet alliance is invincible in the world, and the unity of the socialist camp is invincible in the world.

    The ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been ten years in which our country has fought victoriously with the Soviet Union and other socialist fraternal countries in close unity to defend the fruits of the socialist revolution, to defend world peace, and to oppose the imperialist policies of aggression and war.

    In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country signed the Sino–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union. This is a great alliance between two great socialist countries. This alliance has an extremely huge and far-reaching impact on China and the Soviet Union, on the international situation, and on the historical development of all mankind. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the time: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and affect the victory of world peace and justice."

    In the following years, our country also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation with fraternal countries such as the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.

    The Soviet Union and European socialist countries concluded the Warsaw Pact to prevent aggression. Our country, as an observer, participated in the meetings of the Warsaw Pact member states and resolutely supported all measures taken by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact member states to safeguard world peace.

    In order to defend the revolutionary achievements of socialist countries, China and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have always stood on the same position, supported each other, and dealt a heavy blow to imperialist aggression.

    When American imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea, attempting to enslave the Korean people and dreaming of attacking the newly established People's Republic of China, the Chinese people sent volunteers to fully support the just struggle of the Korean fraternal people. With the unanimous support of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, the Chinese and Korean people finally shattered the American imperialist aggression plan in Korea and restored peace in Korea.

    The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam carried out a long and resolute struggle against French imperialism supported by American imperialism in order to realize independence. In order to thwart the American imperialist conspiracy to expand the war in Indochina, China and the Soviet Union, together with the Vietnamese people, strove to conclude the Geneva Accords, restore peace in Indochina, thereby ensuring that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam could peacefully build the northern region.

    When imperialism incited riots in Hungary, attempting to restore capitalism, the Hungarian people, with the support of the Soviet Red Army, smashed the subversive conspiracy of the Hungarian reactionary forces at home and abroad. China and all socialist countries gave full support to this struggle of the Hungarian people. And the largest anti-Soviet and anti-communist upsurge launched by imperialism by taking advantage of the Hungarian incident after the war was also decisively hit under the unified unity of the socialist camp. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government demonstrated a firm stand in this struggle and fully fulfilled the basic obligations of safeguarding the Soviet Union and safeguarding the unity of the international communist movement.

    Last autumn, American imperialism launched new military provocations and war threats in the Taiwan Strait region of our country. With the support of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, our people dealt a heavy blow to this threat and provocation by American imperialism.

    China and the Soviet Union and socialist countries have consistently supported the anti-imperialist struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in order to oppose imperialist aggression and colonial enslavement, and have stopped many imperialist interference and aggression against Asian and African countries. The struggle to stop the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt, and the struggle to stop the armed intervention of American and British imperialism in the Iraqi revolution, fully proved that socialist countries are loyal friends and the most reliable forces of oppressed nations.

    The experience of the socialist countries uniting to fight against imperialism for ten years has repeatedly proved that today, the Sino-Soviet alliance is invincible in the world, and the unity of the socialist camp is invincible in the world. Although imperialism seems powerful and is still rampant, it is actually a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Now the people of the whole world have increasingly clearly realized that the balance of class forces in the world situation has long been in the socialist camp, not in the imperialist camp. But we should always be vigilant that imperialism is not willing to die, and the danger of war has not been completely eliminated. We insist on peace and oppose war, but we are not afraid of war either. If imperialism dares to take risks, then it will be as Comrade Mao Zedong warned: "As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world will surely wipe them off the face of the earth!"

    Economic mutual assistance and cooperation among fraternal countries has promoted the development of economic construction of the entire socialist camp.

    Over the past ten years, in order to accelerate our country's socialist construction and promote the common upsurge of the socialist camp's economy, our country has developed extensive economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    The economic cooperation between our country and socialist fraternal countries, which is developed on the basis of complete equality, mutual benefit, and comradely mutual assistance, fully demonstrates the essence of the new type of relationship between socialist countries and embodies the principle of socialist internationalism.

    In our country's socialist industrial construction, our country has received tremendous assistance from fraternal countries.

    Here, we must first mention the Soviet people's comprehensive, enormous, and fraternal assistance to our country. In addition to helping our country build and rebuild many huge enterprises during the recovery period, during our country's first five-year plan, according to the agreement between the two governments, the Soviet Union helped our country build a total of 166 major projects, which powerfully promoted our country's industrialization. In August 1958 and February 1959, China and the Soviet Union signed two more agreements. According to the agreements, the Soviet Union will separately help our country carry out the construction of 125 large enterprises. During the period from 1959 to 1967, the total value of equipment and materials purchased by our country from the Soviet Union and various technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union reached about 5 billion rubles. These huge assistance have played and will continue to play an extremely huge role in accelerating our country's socialist construction.

    Other socialist countries, such as the German Democratic Republic in electricity and radio equipment, Poland in coal mining and sugar refining, Romania in electricity and the oil industry, and Czechoslovakia in electricity and machinery manufacturing, have all given extremely valuable assistance to our country's industrial construction.

    The Soviet Union has also given great assistance to our country in scientific and technological research. In 1958, China and the Soviet Union signed a protocol on jointly conducting 122 major scientific and technological researches from 1958 to 1962. Chinese and Soviet scientists are jointly studying the peaceful use of atomic energy. Our country has also conducted extensive cooperation with other fraternal countries in scientific and technological research.

    With the progress of our country's economic construction, our country has also provided technical assistance and economic assistance to the construction of several fraternal countries such as Vietnam, Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and some Eastern European fraternal countries.

    Our country's trade relations with socialist countries are a form of economic mutual support between fraternal countries. The proportion of socialist countries in our country's total foreign trade has accounted for about 75% over the past few years, and the absolute trade volume between our country and socialist countries has also been increasing continuously. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement in 1950, the trade volume between China and the Soviet Union has increased by three and a half times by 1958. Trade with other socialist countries has also increased greatly. Compared with 1950, the trade volume between our country and the entire socialist camp has increased by more than five times.

    The above-mentioned comradely cooperation between our country and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in economic construction, trade, and scientific and technological research is a vivid and clear example of the superiority of the socialist economic system. The major achievements made in our country's socialist economic construction in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist fraternal countries. At the same time, this comradely mutual assistance and cooperation has promoted the rapid development of the economic construction of the entire socialist camp, consolidated and expanded the world socialist economic system, and greatly enhanced the unity among socialist countries.

    In the competition with the capitalist world, victory definitely belongs to the socialist camp.

    On the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we see that the socialist camp, which is ideologically and politically united and economically booming, is like the rising sun, prosperous and strong, while the imperialist camp is like the setting sun, full of crises and torn apart.

    Now the socialist camp has launched a heroic movement to defeat capitalism in peaceful competition.

    The Soviet Union's great communist construction program—the Seven-Year Plan—is being implemented victoriously. After the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, it will exceed or approach the current level of the United States in major industrial products, and in another five years or less, the Soviet Union's industry will exceed the United States in terms of per capita output and jump to the first place in the world.

    In 1958, under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, our country realized the "Great Leap Forward" and pioneered the people's commune movement in rural areas. In 1959, we will continue to leap forward. The main indicators of the original second five-year plan will be completed three years ahead of schedule. The slogan of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years can be realized in about ten years ahead of schedule. Other socialist countries, such as the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Korea, have also put forward slogans of catching up with and surpassing West Germany and Japan within a certain number of years.

    After the Soviet Union completes the Seven-Year Plan, plus other socialist countries realize their own long-term plans, the proportion of the socialist camp's total industrial output in the world's total industrial output will rise from about one-third at present to more than one-half. The socialist system surpassing the capitalist system in total industrial production will be another victory of great historical significance in the competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system.

    The working people of the whole world see the future of mankind from the sharp contrast between the two systems and from the brilliant achievements of the socialist camp. It is not the increasingly weak and aging imperialist camp that determines the development process of historical events, but the increasingly powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is united as one. It is the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries that point out the future and determine the direction of human history.

    On the tenth anniversary of the National Day, we are excited to see that from the distant Adriatic Sea of Albania to the coast of the East Sea of Korea, on the vast land of socialist countries, socialist red flags are flying everywhere, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity, unity, and prosperity. Looking forward to the future, let us make every effort to consolidate and strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp, and achieve greater and final victories in the struggle to defend world peace and in the competition with the capitalist system!

    团结在社会主义阵营的旗帜下奋勇前进
    张香山　叶蠖生　刘克明
    社会主义各国的团结日益增强，社会主义阵营的力量日益发展
    十年前，中华人民共和国宣告成立，这标志着中国人民赢得了新民主主义革命的胜利。这个有历史意义的伟大胜利，是中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下经过长期英勇的斗争，并在国际革命力量的支持下取得的。
    在中华人民共和国宣告成立的时候，毛泽东同志代表全国人民的意志，向全世界宣告，我们必须首先和苏联以及各人民民主国家团结在一起。这也就是说，解放了的中国，从此列入了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。
    中国之参加社会主义阵营，是中国革命和世界革命发展的必然产物。因为中国人民同其他社会主义国家的人民、特别是同苏联人民，存在着久远的革命友谊。在我们社会主义国家中，劳动人民掌握了政权，马克思列宁主义是我们共同的指导思想，建设共产主义是我们共同的伟大理想，无产阶级的国际主义和平等的同志的互助关系，是处理我们关系中的共同准则；在建设社会主义、共产主义中需要相互支援、交流经验；在保卫革命成果，反对帝国主义的斗争中，需要相互支持，敌忾同仇，而这些共同理想，共同利益，就把我国同所有社会主义国家紧密地联结在一起了。如所周知，这个社会主义阵营是以苏联为首的，因为苏联是第一个实现无产阶级革命和建成社会主义的国家，它的力量最为强大，经验最为丰富，在全世界人民的心目中具有最高的威望。
    中国这个六亿多人口的东方大国，挣脱了资本主义体系后坚决地站到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中来，反对帝国主义侵略阵营，这就大大地加强了社会主义阵营的力量。在中国革命胜利之后，社会主义阵营国家的人口占全世界的三分之一以上，领土则占四分之一以上，亘贯欧亚，连成一片，东西遥相呼应，结束了帝国主义包围社会主义世界的旧的局面。这样就使世界的力量对比关系，发生了有利于社会主义国家的巨大变化。
    列宁在1923年就曾预见到中国人民的解放斗争所具有的伟大意义。他说：“斗争的结局归根到底取决于这一点：俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口的绝大多数。正是这大多数的人口，最近几年来也非常迅速地卷入争取自身解放的斗争中。所以在这个意义上讲来，世界斗争问题的最终解决不能有丝毫的怀疑。在这个意义上讲来，社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有保证的。”也正是就这个意义上说，我国新民主主义革命的胜利，不能不认为是人类继俄国十月革命胜利之后所取得的又一次伟大胜利。
    中国革命是无产阶级领导的世界社会主义革命的一部分，因此中国共产党在完成了新民主主义革命之后，就立即把革命推向前进，实现了社会主义革命，现在正以最高的速度，向着建设社会主义的康庄大道前进。
    中国新民主主义革命的胜利，就国际条件来说，是依靠苏联和国际革命力量的支持，反过来，中国人民又以自身的胜利来增强社会主义阵营的力量；在中国实行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程中，我们国家则在更大的规模上取得了社会主义阵营的援助，反过来，我国人民也以自己的革命斗争和更大的成就来不断增强社会主义阵营的力量，来经常巩固社会主义阵营的团结。建国以来的十年，是我国同苏联以及所有社会主义国家的团结一直增强的十年，同时也是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益发展的十年。
    兄弟国家革命和建设经验的交流，大大丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库
    马克思列宁主义是社会主义各国团结的思想基础。社会主义各国都遵循着马克思列宁主义的普遍规律来实行社会主义革命和建设社会主义，同时各社会主义国家在其运用普遍规律于本国实践的过程中，又不断地创造新的经验，来丰富马克思列宁主义的总宝库。这些经验成为彼此间的最可宝贵的支援。
    中国是取得革命胜利和进行社会主义建设较晚的国家，因此每一个兄弟国家的先进的革命经验和建设经验，尤其是第一个社会主义国家苏联的经验，对我国革命和建设事业都具有无可估量的重大意义。毛泽东同志一再地号召全党和全国人民努力学习苏联，他说：“苏联人民在社会主义革命斗争和长期的社会主义和共产主义的建设的过程中，积累了极其丰富的经验。这些经验是全世界劳动人民的巨大财富。中国人民在过去的革命斗争中和目前的建设社会主义的事业中都从苏联学到许多宝贵的东西。今后，中国人民还要继续加强学习苏联的先进经验，以加速中国的社会主义建设。”
    中国共产党中央委员会向党的八次全国代表大会的政治报告中说：“尽管我国的革命有自己的许多特点，可是中国共产党人把自己所干的事业看成是伟大的十月革命的继续”。
    其他兄弟国家的先进经验也同样具有重大意义，给了我们非常有益的支援。由于某些兄弟国家同我国的国情相近，或者由于某些兄弟国家同我国处于相同的革命阶段，在这种情况下，兄弟国家的经验对我们也就特别有益。
    不仅正面经验有重大意义，反面经验也给人教益，它可以使我们不致重复错误，不走或少走弯路。
    先进经验的交流，是我们进行胜利斗争的力量源泉之一。不能设想，如果没有兄弟国家的斗争经验所丰富了的马克思列宁主义总宝库供我们汲取力量，我国社会主义建设事业，在这十年间会取得这样伟大的成就。正是这些经验，帮助了我们顺利发展，帮助了我们预见到建设事业中将要遇到的重大障碍，得以订出预防措施；帮助我们在事业进行中及时地发现错误和缺点，彻底予以纠正。由此可见，我国人民十年来在建设社会主义事业中所取得的重大成就，是和兄弟国家人民的成就水乳交融，无法分开的。
    在充分地估计到我国社会主义建设事业从兄弟国家的先进经验中汲取力量和支援的同时，还必须看到，我国六亿人民在建设社会主义事业中所积累的重要经验，也大大地丰富了马克思列宁主义的总宝库，对兄弟国家的革命和建设事业起着积极的作用。毛泽东同志对我国革命和建设经验的理论性的总结，都是属于这样性质的。它们汇集到马克思列宁主义的总宝库之中，成为共同的贵重财产。这就是我们党在国际经验交流中，在兄弟国家互相支援中所尽的义务和贡献。
    由社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验所丰富和不断发展的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，如果不能同本国实践相结合，则这个国家也就不可能有无产阶级革命胜利和社会主义建设及向共产主义过渡的胜利。教条主义者企图使马克思列宁主义的普遍真理脱离具体实践，变成凝固的死的原则，从而既妨害了马克思列宁主义理论的发展，也不可能对国际无产阶级的共同事业作出应有的贡献，因此，中国共产党为克服教条主义进行了斗争。但是必须指出，作为资产阶级思潮的修正主义，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。修正主义者否认在过渡时期共产党的领导和无产阶级专政的巨大作用和必要性，力图腐蚀马克思主义的革命灵魂，他们是打入无产阶级队伍中的最凶恶的革命叛徒，是当前国际共产主义运动最危险的敌人。中国共产党同兄弟党一道，为了保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为了保卫社会主义各国兄弟般的团结，同南斯拉夫的现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。经过这场大是大非的斗争，南斯拉夫领导集团甘心为美帝国主义服务的面貌，现在已经是大白于天下了。
    中苏同盟无敌于天下，社会主义阵营的团结无敌于天下
    我国建国以来的十年，是我国同苏联及其他社会主义兄弟国家亲密团结为保卫社会主义革命成果，为捍卫世界和平、反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，进行了胜利斗争的十年。
    在中华人民共和国成立的初期，我国就同苏联签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。这是两个伟大社会主义国家的伟大同盟。这个同盟对于中苏两国，对于国际局势，对于全人类的历史发展进程，都有极为巨大的深远的影响。毛泽东同志当时指出：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    在以后的几年中，我国又和德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等兄弟国家，签订了友好合作条约。
    苏联、欧洲社会主义国家为了防止侵略，缔结了华沙条约，我国以观察员身分，参加了华沙条约缔约国的历次会议，并且坚决支持苏联和华沙条约缔约国的一切维护世界和平的措施。
    为捍卫社会主义国家的革命成果，中国和苏联以及其他社会主义国家始终站在同一的立场上，互相支持，给予帝国主义的侵犯以狠狠的打击。
    当美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，妄图奴役朝鲜人民，并梦想向刚成立的中华人民共和国进攻的时候，中国人民派出了志愿军，全力支援朝鲜兄弟人民的正义斗争。在苏联和社会主义阵营的一致支持下，中朝人民终于粉碎了美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略计划，恢复了朝鲜的和平。
    越南民主共和国人民，为了实现独立，同由美帝国主义支持的法帝国主义进行了长期的坚决的斗争。为了挫败美帝国主义在印度支那扩大战争的阴谋，中国、苏联同越南人民一道，争取缔订了日内瓦协议，恢复了印度支那的和平，从而保证了越南民主共和国能够和平地建设北部地区。
    当帝国主义在匈牙利煽动暴乱，妄图复辟资本主义的时候，匈牙利人民在苏联红军的支持下，粉碎了匈牙利内外反动派的颠复阴谋。中国和所有社会主义国家对匈牙利人民这一斗争给予了全力支持。而帝国主义借匈牙利事变所发动的战后最大的反苏反共高潮，也在社会主义阵营的团结一致下遭到了决定性的打击。中国共产党和中国政府，在这个斗争中表现了坚定的立场，充分地尽到了维护苏联，维护国际共产主义运动的团结的基本义务。
    去年秋天，美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区又发动了新的军事挑衅和战争威胁，我国人民在苏联和兄弟国家的支持下，给予了美帝国主义的这种威胁和挑衅以狠狠的打击。
    中苏两国和社会主义国家一起，为了反对帝国主义的侵略和殖民主义的奴役，一贯地支持了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各地区的反对帝国主义的斗争，制止了帝国主义许许多多次对亚非国家所发动的干涉和侵略行动。在制止英、法、以对埃及的侵略的斗争中，在制止美英帝国主义武装干涉伊拉克革命的斗争中，都充分地证明了社会主义国家是被压迫民族的忠实朋友和最可依靠的力量。
    十年来社会主义国家团结一致对帝国主义斗争的经验，一再证明：在今天，中苏同盟无敌于天下，社会主义阵营的团结无敌于天下。帝国主义虽然貌似强大，还在横行霸道，实则是外强中干的纸老虎。现在全世界人民已越来越清楚地认识到，世界局势中的阶级力量对比关系，优势早已在社会主义阵营方面，而不是在帝国主义方面。但是我们应该时刻警惕，帝国主义并不甘心死亡，战争的危险并未最终消除。我们坚持和平，反对战争，但也不怕战争。如果帝国主义胆敢冒险，那就将如毛泽东同志所警告的那样：“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”
    兄弟国家间经济上的互助合作，促进了整个社会主义阵营经济建设的发展
    十年来，为了加速我国的社会主义建设，促进社会主义阵营经济的共同高涨，我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家，发展了广泛的经济合作。
    在完全平等、互利、同志般互助基础上发展起来的我国和社会主义兄弟国家之间的经济合作，充分表明了社会主义国家新型关系的实质，体现了社会主义的国际主义的原则。
    在我国社会主义工业建设中，我国得到了兄弟国家的巨大援助。
    这里，首先必须提到苏联人民对我国的全面的、巨大的、兄弟般的援助。除去在恢复期间，苏联帮助我国新建改建许多巨大企业外，在我国第一个五年计划期间，根据两国政府协议，苏联帮助我国建设的重大项目共有一百六十六项，有力地促进了我国的工业化。1958年8月和1959年2月，中苏两国又签订两项协定，根据协定，苏联将另行帮助我国进行一百二十五项大企业的建设。在1959到1967年期间，我国向苏联购买的设备材料和苏联提供的各种技术援助总值共达五十亿卢布左右。这些巨大的援助，对我国加速社会主义建设，起到了并将继续起到极为巨大的作用。
    其他社会主义国家，例如德意志民主共和国在电力、无线电器材，波兰在采煤、制糖，罗马尼亚在电力、石油工业，捷克斯洛伐克在电力、机械制造等方面，都给我国工业建设以极可宝贵的帮助。
    苏联在科学技术研究方面也给予我国极大的援助。1958年，中苏两国签订了关于从1958年到1962年共同进行一百二十二项重大科学技术研究的议定书。中苏科学家正共同研究原子能的和平利用问题。我国同其他兄弟国家，在科学技术研究方面，也进行了广泛的合作。
    随着我国经济建设的进展，我国也对若干兄弟国家如越南、朝鲜、蒙古人民共和国和一些东欧兄弟国家的建设，提供了技术援助和经济援助。
    我国同社会主义国家的贸易关系是兄弟国家间经济上相互支援的一种形式。社会主义国家在我国对外贸易总额中所占比重，几年来都占75％左右，我国同社会主义国家的绝对贸易额也不断增长。从1950年签订中苏贸易协定以来，到1958年，中苏两国的贸易额增长了三倍半。和其他社会主义国家的贸易也都有了很大增加。我国和整个社会主义阵营的贸易额与1950年相比，增长了五倍以上。
    上述我国同苏联及其他社会主义国家在经济建设、贸易和科学技术研究等方面的同志般的合作，是社会主义经济体系的优越性的生动的明显的例证。建国十年来，我国的社会主义经济建设取得的重大成就，是和苏联以及其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助分不开的。同时，这种同志般的互助合作，又促进了整个社会主义阵营经济建设的飞跃发展，巩固和扩大了世界社会主义经济体系，极大地增强了社会主义国家间的团结。
    在同资本主义世界的竞赛中，胜利肯定属于社会主义阵营
    在中华人民共和国成立的第十周年，我们看到：思想上政治上团结一致的、经济上蓬勃发展的社会主义阵营正如朝日东升，繁荣昌盛，而帝国主义阵营，则如夕阳西下，危机重重，四分五裂。
    现在社会主义阵营已经发动了一个豪迈的运动，要在和平竞赛中赛垮资本主义。
    苏联伟大的共产主义的建设纲领——七年计划正在胜利执行。七年计划完成以后，将在主要工业产品上分别超过或接近美国现在的水平，而再过五年或更短的时间，苏联的工业将在按人口平均的产量方面超过美国而跃居世界第一位。
    1958年，我国在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线照耀下，实现了“大跃进”，开创了农村的人民公社运动。1959年还将继续跃进。原定的第二个五年计划的主要指标，将提前三年完成。十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上或超过英国的口号，可以提前在十年左右的时间内实现。而其他如民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜等等社会主义国家，也分别提出了在一定年限内，赶上和超过西德、日本等国的口号。
    在苏联完成七年计划以后，加上其他社会主义国家实现了自己的远景计划，则社会主义阵营的工业总产量，在全世界工业总产量中所占比重，将由目前的三分之一左右，上升到二分之一以上。社会主义体系在工业生产总量上超过资本主义体系，这将是社会主义体系和资本主义体系竞赛中又一个有伟大历史意义的胜利。
    全世界劳动人民从两个制度的鲜明对比中，从社会主义阵营的光辉成就中，看到人类的将来。决定历史事变发展进程的，不是日益衰弱老朽的帝国主义阵营，而是团结一致的日益强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。正是苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家，指明着前途，决定着人类历史的发展方向。
    在国庆十周年的今天，我们兴奋地看到：从辽远的阿尔巴尼亚的亚得里亚海到朝鲜的东海之滨，在广大的社会主义国家土地上，到处飘扬着社会主义的红旗，到处是一片兴旺繁荣团结的气象。瞻望将来，让我们尽一切努力来巩固和加强社会主义阵营的伟大团结，在保卫世界和平的斗争中，在和资本主义制度进行竞赛中，取得更大的最终的胜利！
