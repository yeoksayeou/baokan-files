Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 16th. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement warmly welcoming the Soviet government's proposal to promptly convene a meeting of countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to resolve the Laotian issue.

The statement first emphasized the important role played by the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements in maintaining peace in Indochina and condemned the United States for its long-standing attempts to undermine these agreements by every possible means.

The statement pointed out: Currently, the United States is interfering in Laos even more blatantly. More seriously, the United States, together with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc, is actively preparing for armed intervention in Laos.

The statement said: "In order to evade responsibility and deceive public opinion, the US imperialists and the Phoui Sananikone government have instead slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and submitted the Laotian issue to the United Nations. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, disregarding the Soviet representative's veto, illegally decided to establish a subcommittee to investigate the Laotian situation. This action violates the United Nations Charter, violates the principle of unanimity among the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos. It is clear that US imperialism is plotting to use the flag of the United Nations to strengthen its interference in Laos."

The statement then pointed out: "As a signatory to the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always hoped to establish good-neighborly relations with Laos on the principles of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for the agreements that have already been signed. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot remain indifferent to the blatant violation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos by the US imperialists and the Phoui Sananikone government, which has made the Laotian situation extremely dangerous and seriously and directly threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and threatens peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia." The statement said: "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the only way to solve the Laotian issue is to strictly and fully implement the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the Vientiane Agreements signed between the Kingdom of Laos government and the Laotian Fighting Units. US imperialism must immediately stop interfering in Laos. The Sananikone government must stop the civil war and respect and implement the various provisions of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements. The activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos must be restored. The United Nations investigation subcommittee will not only not help solve the Laotian issue but will instead make the Laotian situation more complex and serious."

The statement concluded: "As pointed out in the Soviet government's statement, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the current tension in Laos must and can only be resolved on the basis of the Geneva Agreements and within its framework, because this agreement is the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly welcomes the Soviet government's initiative and warmly supports convening a meeting of countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina and approves of the Laotian International Commission for Supervision and Control submitting a report to the meeting on the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the measures that must be taken to normalize the situation in Laos. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is always ready to contribute to this meeting to seek a solution to the current serious situation in Laos, thereby promoting the normalization of the situation in Laos and maintaining peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

    越南政府欢迎苏联关于解决老挝问题的建议
    热烈支持召开日内瓦会议参加国会议
    新华社河内16日电　越南民主共和国政府今天发表声明，热烈欢迎苏联政府提出的迅速召集1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国会议来解决老挝问题的建议。
    声明首先强调了日内瓦协议和万象协议对维护印度支那和平所起的重要作用，并且谴责美国长期以来一直千方百计地企图破坏这些协议。
    声明指出：目前，美国正在更加明目张胆地干涉老挝。更加严重的是，美国正在同东南亚条约组织侵略集团一起积极准备对老挝进行武装干涉。
    声明说：“为了逃避责任和欺骗舆论，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府反而诬蔑越南民主共和国，把老挝问题提交联合国。在美国操纵下，联合国安全理事会不顾苏联代表的否决，非法地决定成立调查老挝局势的小组委员会。这个行动违反了联合国宪章，违反了联合国安全理事会常任理事国一致的原则，违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议。很显然，美帝国主义阴谋利用联合国的旗帜来加强对老挝的干涉。”
    声明接着指出：“作为签订1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝王国的邻邦，越南民主共和国一向希望在和平共处的原则上，在双方都尊重已经签订的协议的基础上，同老挝建立睦邻关系。对于美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府明目张胆地违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议，使老挝局势变得极其危险，并且严重地直接威胁到越南民主共和国的安全、威胁印度支那和东南亚的和平的这些行动，越南民主共和国政府不能置若罔闻。”声明说：“越南民主共和国政府认为，解决老挝问题的唯一途径就是严格和充分地履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队签订的万象协议。美帝国主义必须立即停止对老挝的干涉。萨纳尼空政府必须停止内战，尊重并履行日内瓦协议和万象协议的各项条款。必须恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。联合国的调查小组委员会不仅无助于解决老挝问题，反而会使老挝局势变得更加复杂和严重。”
    声明最后说：“正如苏联政府的声明所指出的，越南民主共和国政府认为，当前的老挝紧张局势必须而且只能在日内瓦协议的基础上和在它的范围内加以解决，因为这个协议是印度支那的和平和安全的基础。越南民主共和国政府热烈欢迎苏联政府的倡议，并热烈支持召开1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议参加国会议，赞成让老挝国际监察和监督委员会就关于老挝的日内瓦协议的履行情况和为使老挝局势正常化所必须采取的措施问题向会议作报告。越南民主共和国政府随时准备为这个会议作出贡献，以寻求解决老挝当前严重局势的办法，从而促使老挝局势正常化，维护印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
