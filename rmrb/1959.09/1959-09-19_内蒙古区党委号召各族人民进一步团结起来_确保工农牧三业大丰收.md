The Tenth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from September 2 to 13. This enlarged meeting conscientiously conveyed, studied, and discussed the resolutions and important reports of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Through study and discussion, all the comrades present were greatly educated and encouraged, and their political and class consciousness was raised. The meeting unanimously supported the Central Committee's resolutions on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. It was decided that the current tasks are to resolutely defend the Party's General Line; resolutely implement the General Line, oppose Right deviation, boost morale, launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, complete and overfulfill this year's production tasks, and seize a bumper harvest in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry.

Based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session, the meeting discussed and analyzed the situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, delivered a report on the current situation and tasks in Inner Mongolia. The report pointed out that the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is in line with the current actual situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The overall situation in the Autonomous Region is very good, the future is bright, and it is in a situation of continued leap forward. By the end of August this year, the total industrial output value reached 1.04 billion yuan, an increase of 60.5% over the same period last year. Compared with the same period last year, the main products have also increased significantly. By the end of August, steel reached 17,000 tons and iron reached 96,000 tons, which not only exceeded the total steel production of the whole year last year, but also established several small and medium-sized steelmaking and ironmaking bases. The region has built 2,500 cubic meters of small blast furnaces, of which 1,520 cubic meters are fully equipped. From January to August this year, coal production reached 4.88 million tons, an increase of 1.6 times over the same period last year; timber production reached 2.85 million cubic meters, an increase of 35.3% over the same period last year; power machinery reached 6,750 horsepower, an increase of 4.1 times over the same period last year. There has also been a great leap forward in light industrial production. By the end of August this year, handicrafts had recovered 579 types, and added 480 new types, which is actually 125 types more than the same period last year. By the end of August, the investment in capital construction was 530 million yuan, which was 1.6 times that of the same period last year. The national key projects in the Autonomous Region are progressing rapidly, especially the No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Steel, which has already started trial operation and can be put into production before National Day. In terms of transportation, the freight volume in the first half of this year has also increased significantly, with railways reaching 11.63 million tons, an increase of 79% over the same period last year; automobiles reaching 12.542 million ton-kilometers, an increase of 54% over the same period last year; and civil transportation reaching 119.53 million ton-kilometers, an increase of 29% over the same period last year.

In agricultural production, spring wheat has achieved a bumper harvest, and a bumper harvest of autumn crops is expected. Animal husbandry production has achieved the first bumper harvest since the establishment of people's communes. The people's communes in pastoral areas have demonstrated great superiority. By the end of June, the number of livestock reached more than 28.02 million, with a total breeding rate of 28%. After deducting various consumptions, the net increase was 14.51%, which was more than 3.55 million more than the net increase in 1958 (Note: Inner Mongolia's livestock calculation is based on the customary pastoral year, that is, from July 1 of the previous year to June end of the following year, which is the period when livestock breeding and survival have been determined). The number of pigs in the region has increased to 2.32 million, and the number of poultry has increased to more than 9 million. The supply of non-staple food in the market is further improving.

The meeting believes that the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued leap forward in 1959, and the consolidation and sound development of the people's communes have brought about tremendous changes in the Autonomous Region in terms of economy, politics, and ethnic relations, and everywhere presents a scene of prosperity in construction. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and herdsmen has been unprecedentedly enhanced in the Great Leap Forward in production and the communization of the people. The workers and staff of all nationalities are engaged in selfless labor with the attitude of masters of their own affairs, and socialist democracy has gradually formed a system in industrial and mining enterprises. The lofty idea of ​​unity of purpose, solidarity, and concerted efforts to build socialism has been firmly established. After the struggle between the two roads, two lines, and two styles of work, the determination and confidence of the peasants and herdsmen in building socialism is stronger than ever. In particular, due to the realization of the people's communes, most of the communes have become national joint societies, and the socialist national relations of great unity, great cooperation, common labor, and common progress are being formed. The development of production has gradually improved the living standards of all ethnic groups and gradually brought the living standards of ethnic minorities closer to the level of advanced ethnic groups. This has changed ethnic relations to a great extent and to a profound degree. For example, in 1954, there were only more than 340,000 people in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia. Due to the welcome of rural people to the pastoral areas by people of all ethnic groups, the pastoral areas have now increased to 519,000 people, most of whom are Han working people. The Great Leap Forward and the communization movement have also enabled 90% of the lamas to participate in the people's communes, and some have become workers.

The meeting believes that although the Autonomous Region has made great achievements last year and in the first half of this year, it is necessary to boost even greater efforts to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks. The main danger currently hindering the continued leap forward in work is Right-leaning thought, Right-leaning emotions, and Right-leaning activities. Therefore, the meeting believes that the central task of the Autonomous Region at present is to oppose Right deviation, boost morale, and launch a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy in accordance with the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks. At present, it is particularly important to seize the time to complete and overfulfill the production targets for the third quarter and present gifts to the great National Day. At the same time, we must complete and overfulfill this year's production and construction tasks and use these new and continued leap forward achievements to counterattack reactionaries at home and abroad and refute Right-leaning opportunists inside and outside the Party, defend the General Line, and defend the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes.

The meeting believes that in order to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical achievements, the Party organizations of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should mobilize the people of all nationalities in the region to accelerate the pace of construction with soaring enthusiasm and strive to complete production targets that are higher than planned. After repeated discussions, the meeting revised the targets for steel, iron, coal, timber, salt, and grain. The revised targets are higher than the original plan. The participants were full of confidence in completing and overfulfilling this year's production plans. The meeting required all localities to: (1) strengthen the leadership of the autumn harvest, ensure the completion of the grain and oil production tasks, and strive for a greater bumper harvest; continue to focus on ensuring that livestock are full of fat, full of pregnancy, epidemic prevention, haying, material preparation, shed construction, and do a good job in livestock breeding and breed improvement, and concentrate on preparations for wintering, so as to prepare conditions for a greater and better leap forward in animal husbandry production next year. (2) Make every effort to grasp grain work. The first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, especially the Party committees in agricultural areas, must grasp it personally. From now until before the Spring Festival next year, they must not slacken their efforts for a single day. While satisfactorily completing the task of grain purchase, we must arrange the work of unified grain sales in agricultural and pastoral areas and the work of grain supply in cities and towns. We must educate peasants, herdsmen and urban residents to be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, save grain, learn to be careful and live a long and frugal life. (3) Mobilize people of all nationalities to vigorously support Baotou Steel, ensure that the No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Steel produces iron on time, present gifts to the National Day, and at the same time ensure the completion of the production tasks of steel, coal, timber, daily-use industrial products, and handicraft products in the Autonomous Region. (4) Make overall arrangements for rural labor force, carry out a mass movement of short-distance transportation in a planned and led manner, and organize a short-distance transportation team of 100,000 to 120,000 people throughout the region to successfully complete the tasks in the fourth quarter of this year. (5) While grasping production and life, we must do a good job in ideological work and carry out publicity and education activities. All Party leading cadres must study political economics, the Party's policies, and Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

The meeting believes that in order to successfully achieve this year's leap forward and prepare for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward next year, we must adhere to the Party's General Line, oppose Right-leaning opportunist ideas, must study theories and policies, summarize experience, and improve the level of work; we must continue to adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the Party's leadership, and carry out mass movements on a large scale. The working methods of the Party's mass line, which have been greatly developed since last year's Great Leap Forward and the two major mass movements of communization, such as large-scale airing of views, large-scale debates, big-character posters, cadres "cultivating experimental plots," "two participations and three combinations," "grasping both ends and leading the middle," organizing visits and evaluations, holding on-site meetings, and holding five-level and six-level cadre meetings, etc., must continue to be used and seek further development.

    内蒙古区党委号召各族人民进一步团结起来
    确保工农牧三业大丰收
    本报讯　中共内蒙古自治区委员会第十次全体委员（扩大）会议，从9月2日到13日，在内蒙古自治区首府——呼和浩特举行。这次扩大会议认真地传达、学习和讨论了党的八届八中全会的决议和重要报告。通过学习和讨论，使到会的全体同志受到了极大的教育和鼓舞，提高了政治思想和阶级觉悟。会议一致拥护中央关于开展增产节约运动等项决议。把坚决保卫党的总路线；坚决贯彻执行总路线，反右倾，鼓干劲，开展增产节约的群众运动，完成和超额完成今年的生产任务，夺取工、农、牧业的大丰收，定为当前的任务。
    会议根据八中全会精神，讨论和分析了内蒙古自治区的形势。内蒙古党委第一书记乌兰夫代表内蒙古党委，在会上作了关于目前内蒙古的形势与任务的报告。报告指出，党的八届八中全会的精神，是切合内蒙古自治区当前的实际情况的。自治区目前大局很好，前途光明，正处在继续跃进的形势中。工业总产值，到今年8月底完成了十亿四千万元，比去年同期增长了60.5％。主要产品和去年同期比较，也有了显著的增长。到8月底钢达到一万七千吨，铁达到九万六千吨，不仅都超过了去年全年钢铁产量的总和，而且建立了几个炼钢和炼铁的中小型基地。全区仅小高炉已建立起两千五百立米，配成套的已有一千五百二十立米。从今年1到8月份，煤产量达到四百八十八万吨，比去年同期增长一点六倍；木材生产达到二百八十五万立米，比去年同期增长35.3％；动力机械达到六千七百五十马力，比去年同期增长四点一倍。轻工业生产，也有很大的跃进。到今年8月底，手工业已恢复五百七十九种，新增四百八十种，实际比去年同期增加了一百二十五种。基本建设，到8月底投资额完成五亿三千万元，为去年同期的一点六倍。在自治区内的几项国家重点工程进展都很迅速，特别是包钢一号高炉，已经开始试车，国庆节前，可以投入生产。交通运输方面，今年上半年运货量也有很大增长，铁路达一千一百六十三万吨，比去年同期增长79％；汽车达一万二千五百四十二吨公里，比去年同期增长54％；民间运输达一万一千九百五十三万吨公里，比去年同期增长29％。
    在农业生产上，春小麦已获丰收，大秋作物丰收有望。畜牧业生产已经取得了人民公社化后的第一个大丰收。牧区人民公社发挥了巨大优越性。牲畜头数到6月底已达二千八百零二万多头，总增殖率为28％，除过各项消耗，纯增14.51％，比1958年纯增加了三百五十五万多头（注：内蒙古牲畜计算，按习惯的牧业年度，即从上年的7月1日到次年的6月底，即牲畜繁殖成活已经定局的时期）。全区猪已发展到二百三十二万头，家禽发展到九百多万只。市场副食品供应情况正在进一步好转。
    会议认为1958年的大跃进和1959年的继续跃进，人民公社巩固的、健全的发展，使自治区在经济上、政治上、民族关系上都起了巨大变化，到处呈现着欣欣向荣的建设景象。广大工、农、牧民群众，在生产大跃进和人民公社化中，社会主义觉悟已空前提高。各族职工群众以主人翁的态度从事忘我的劳动，社会主义民主，在工矿企业中已经逐步形成制度。同心同德，团结一致，建设社会主义的崇高思想，已经巩固地树立起来了。农牧民群众经过两条道路、两条路线、两种作风的斗争，建设社会主义的决心和信心，比过去任何时候都更加坚定了。特别是由于人民公社化的实现，使大多数公社都成了民族联合社，大团结、大协作、共同劳动、共同进步的社会主义的民族关系正在形成。而生产的发展使各族人民的生活水平逐步提高，并使少数民族生活水平逐步接近先进民族水平。这就在很大范围、很深刻的程度上改变了民族关系。如内蒙古牧区在1954年只有三十四万多人，由于牧区各族人民欢迎农村人民到牧区，现在牧区已增加到五十一万九千人，其中绝大部分是汉族劳动人民。大跃进和公社化运动，还使得90％的喇嘛参加了人民公社，一部分还当了工人。
    会议认为，自治区去年和今年上半年虽然取得很大成绩，但要完成和超额完成今年的各项任务，还必须鼓起更大的干劲。而当前妨碍工作继续跃进的主要危险，是右倾思想、右倾情绪和右倾活动。因此，会议认为自治区当前的中心任务是根据党的八届八中全会决议，反右倾，鼓干劲，深入开展轰轰烈烈的群众性的增产节约运动，为完成和超额完成今年的各项任务而奋斗。当前特别应抓紧完成和超额完成第三季度的各项生产指标，向伟大的国庆献礼。同时，要完成和超额完成今年全年的各项生产建设任务，拿这些新的继续跃进的巨大成就，来回击国内外反动派，驳斥党内外右倾机会主义分子，保卫总路线，保卫大跃进和人民公社。
    会议认为，为了以实际成就响应党中央的号召，内蒙古自治区党的组织应当发动全区各族人民，以冲天的干劲来加快建设速度，力争完成比计划更高的生产指标。会议经过反复讨论，对钢、铁、煤、木材、盐、粮食等指标都作了修改。修改的指标，比原计划都有所提高。与会人员对完成和超额完成今年各项生产计划都充满信心。会议要求各地在目前必须：（1）加强对秋收的领导，保证完成粮食油料生产任务，并力争更大的丰收；要继续抓好牲畜的满膘、满怀、防疫、打草、备料，棚圈建设，做好牲畜配种和品种改良工作，突击抓好过冬准备工作，为明年畜牧业生产更大更好的跃进准备条件。（2）全力抓粮食工作，各级党委特别是农业地区党委第一书记必须亲自抓，从现在开始，直到明年春节以前，一天也不能松懈。在完满地完成征购粮食任务的同时，要把农牧区的粮食统销工作和城镇粮食供应工作安排好。要教育农牧民和城镇居民勤俭持家，节约粮食，学会精打细算，细水长流地过日子。（3）动员各族人民大力支援包钢，保证包钢一号高炉按时出铁，向国庆献礼，同时保证自治区钢铁、煤炭、木材和日用工业品、手工业品生产任务的完成。（4）要统筹安排农村劳动力，有计划、有领导地开展一个短途运输的群众运动，在全区范围内组织十万到十二万人参加的短途运输队伍，顺利完成今年第四季度任务。（5）在抓生产抓生活的同时，要抓好思想工作，开展宣传教育活动。所有党的领导干部，都要学习政治经济学和党的政策以及毛泽东同志的著作。
    会议认为，要胜利实现今年的跃进并为明年更大、更好、更全面的跃进做好准备，必须坚持党的总路线，反对右倾机会主义思想，必须学习理论政策，总结经验，提高工作水平；必须继续坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动。去年大跃进、公社化两大群众运动以来，得到重大发展的党的群众路线的工作方法，如大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报，干部“种试验田”，“两参三结合”，“抓两头，带中间”，组织参观评比、召开现场会议，以及召开五级、六级干部会议等等，都必须继续运用，并求得进一步的发展。
