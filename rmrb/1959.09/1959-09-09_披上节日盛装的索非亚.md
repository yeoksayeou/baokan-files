Sofia Adorned in Festive Attire

To welcome the 15th anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day, the exceptionally beautiful city of Sofia has been decorated even more attractively. Red flags are flying everywhere in the city, and red banners celebrating National Day are hung on both sides of the streets and alleys, as well as on the trams and buses. The Ninth of September Square has been dressed up for the festival. The Dimitrov Mausoleum and the reviewing stands on both sides have been repaired and are ready. On the buildings on the east side of the square, the indicators of the leap forward in Bulgaria's national economy are prominently displayed. The signs read: Industrial production – 215% increase in 1961 compared to 1957; Agricultural production – double in 1959 compared to 1958, triple in 1960 compared to 1958.

These days, the department stores are bustling with activity, and the escalators are running non-stop, creating an exceptionally lively atmosphere. According to a person in charge of the department store, this year's customers and daily sales volume are higher than in previous years. More than a month before last year's National Day, the average daily number of customers was about 80,000, but this year it has increased to about 130,000 to 160,000. At this time last year, the average daily turnover was 1.2 million leva, but this year it has surged to 1.6 million to 2 million leva. This indicates that people's purchasing power has increased and their lives have improved.

The lives of Sofia residents have undergone extremely profound changes in the fifteen years since the liberation of Bulgaria. Not only has retail trade significantly increased, but social welfare undertakings such as public health, culture, and education have also developed rapidly. At present, the number of theaters has increased from three before liberation to eleven, and the number of cinemas has increased from fifteen to forty-four. The residential area has increased; since 1950, the state has built approximately 700,000 square meters of residential space. This year, the number of medical institutions in the city has increased from twenty in 1939 to one hundred and thirty-five.

In the streets and alleys of Sofia, residents are engaged in voluntary labor, busy repairing street gardens, repainting walls, and cleaning streets. A comrade in charge of this work from the Sofia City Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front said that so far, more than 220,000 residents have participated in this mass voluntary labor to welcome National Day.

The vast number of workers and staff members of industrial enterprises in Sofia, which account for approximately one-quarter of the total national industrial output value, are at the forefront of the labor competition launched to welcome National Day. They overfulfilled the August production plan by 6.1%.

Every festival makes people think of their loved ones even more. The Bulgarian working people will never forget the kindness of their liberators – the Soviet Red Army. At the Monument to the Martyrs of the Soviet Red Army in Freedom Park, more flowers are placed at this time than usual.

    披上节日盛装的索非亚
    为了迎接保加利亚国庆十五周年，异常美丽的索非亚市打扮得更加动人了。市里红旗到处迎风招展，大街小巷的两旁和来往行驶的电车和公共汽车上，挂满了庆祝国庆的红布标语。九九广场已经披上了节日的盛装。季米特洛夫墓前和两旁的观礼台已修整就序。广场东面的建筑物上，高悬着保加利亚国民经济跃进的指标牌。牌上写着：工业生产——1961年增长为1957年的215％，农业生产——1959年增长为1958年的两倍，1960年增长为1958年的三倍。
    这些日子，百货大楼里，熙熙攘攘，自动电梯终日运转不休，显得热闹异常。这个百货大楼的一位负责人说，今年的顾客和每天的售货量比过去那一年都多。去年国庆节前一个多月，平均每天接待的顾客约有八万人次，今年则增加到约十三万到十六万人次。去年这时节，平均每天的贸易额有一百二十万列弗，而今年却激增到一百六十万到二百万列弗。这标志着人民的购买力提高了，生活改善了。
    索非亚市居民生活在保加利亚解放十五年来发生了极为深刻的变化，不仅零售贸易额显著地增长了，在公共保健、文化、教育等社会福利事业方面，也同样迅速地发展了。目前，剧院数目已由解放前的三个增加到十一个，电影院由十五个增加到四十四个。住宅面积增加了，从1950年到现在，国家修建的住宅面积约有七十万平方米。今年，全市的医疗机构已由1939年的二十所，增加到一百三十五所。
    在索非亚市的大街小巷，居民们正在进行义务劳动，忙着修整街心花园，刷修墙壁，清扫街道。保加利亚祖国阵线索非亚市委员会负责这一工作的同志说，到目前为止，参加过这种为迎接国庆而展开的群众义务劳动的居民已达二十二万人以上。
    约占全国工业产品总值四分之一的索非亚市工业企业的广大职工，走在为迎接国庆而展开的劳动竞赛的最前列。他们超额6.1％完成了8月份的生产计划。
    每逢佳节倍思亲，保加利亚劳动人民念念不忘他们的解放者——苏联红军的恩情。位于自由公园的苏联红军烈士纪念碑前，在这个时候，比平常更多地摆上了鲜花。
