Xinhua News Agency, September 19th—Beijing, which originally had no industrial base, has newly built and expanded more than 700 industrial capital construction projects in the ten years since liberation, of which 78 are above the quota limit. The total construction area of these factories reaches 3.86 million square meters; if all converted into 20-meter wide factory buildings, connected together, it would be 193 kilometers long, enough to extend directly from Beijing to Zhangjiakou.

The development of capital industrial construction is increasing year by year. During the Great Leap Forward of last year and this year, the scale and speed of construction reached a new peak. The total investment in capital construction from 1949 to 1952 was more than 89 million yuan. During the first Five-Year Plan period from 1953 to 1957, the average annual investment was 190 million yuan, which increased sharply to 590 million yuan in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958.

After high-speed construction, the capital now has a number of modern factories as the backbone of industry and has opened up many new industrial sectors.

First, a steel industry system is gradually taking shape. For a long time, Beijing had "iron but no steel", let alone steel products. During the mass steelmaking campaign last year, special steel plants, Beijing Steel Plant, the converter steelmaking workshop of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and several rolling steel plants were newly built and expanded at a rapid pace. This year, it can produce more than 300,000 tons of steel and more than 200,000 tons of steel products. The output of iron has also increased from 26,000 tons in 1949 to 520,000 tons in 1958. Since August last year, 22 large and small blast furnaces with volumes ranging from 6.5 cubic meters to 1,000 cubic meters, and 17 converters ranging from 3 tons to 6 tons have been built one after another. The coking industry, ore mining industry, and refractory material industry necessary for the metallurgical industry are also rapidly rising.

Second, the machinery industry has moved from repair and assembly to manufacturing. Before liberation, Beijing only had three dilapidated railway repair factories and nine ordnance repair shops. Now, machine tool factories, agricultural machinery factories, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing factories, automobile manufacturing factories, motor manufacturing factories, construction machinery manufacturing factories, metal structure factories, printing machinery manufacturing factories, and various precision instrument manufacturing factories have been built one after another. The output value of the machinery industry has accounted for more than one-third of the city's total industrial output value. In 1958, Beijing's mechanical industrial products, in terms of metal cutting machine tools alone, reached more than 50 varieties totaling 4,770 units.

Third, the coal industry and the power industry have also developed at a high speed in the past ten years. Eleven modern mines have been newly built and renovated, increasing coal production capacity by 2 million tons. The capacity of power generation equipment has also increased from 58,000 kilowatts to 270,000 kilowatts.

Fourth, the radio industry, which was a blank before liberation, has now emerged as a large-scale modern electronic tube factory, radio equipment factory, wired telecommunications factory, and broadcasting equipment factory, forming a strong radio manufacturing center.

Fifth, the cotton textile industry has grown from scratch, and the woolen textile industry has gone from crude to refined. Before liberation, Beijing "could only weave cloth but not spin yarn," and all the required cotton yarn relied on external supply. Now, with the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mills as the center, plus a number of small textile mills in urban and suburban areas, it already has 250,000 spindles and 10,320 looms. The high-grade woolen fabrics produced by Beijing Qinghe Worsted Mill and Beijing Woolen Mill have won a high reputation in domestic and foreign markets.

Sixth, Beijing's chemical industry was basically a blank in the past. Now, a series of chemical plants such as glass, pharmaceutical, enamel, fertilizer, plastic, synthetic fiber, and coking chemistry have been built, giving this important industrial sector a preliminary scale.

In addition, a large number of new factories have emerged in light industry and the building materials industry. In urban and suburban areas, there are also a large number of medium-sized, small-sized, indigenous, foreign, or indigenous-foreign combined factories, growing like mushrooms after a spring rain. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the suburbs built thousands of agricultural tool manufacturing, local fertilizer, grain processing, and wine and sugar making factories or workshops, manufacturing more than 600,000 pieces of agricultural tools and tens of thousands of tons of local fertilizer.

The rapid growth of this series of industries, especially the Great Leap Forward last year and the continued leap forward this year, marks that the capital has taken a decisive step in the process of moving towards the great goal of a modern industrial city. (Attached picture)

### 向现代化工业城市迈出决定性的一步  首都建成一系列现代化工厂  十年新建扩建七百多个项目，冶金、机械、煤炭、电力、无线电、纺织都已拥有一批骨干企业

    向现代化工业城市迈出决定性的一步
    首都建成一系列现代化工厂
    十年新建扩建七百多个项目，冶金、机械、煤炭、电力、无线电、纺织都已拥有一批骨干企业
    新华社19日讯　原来毫无工业基础的北京，在解放以来的十年中已新建和扩建了七百多个工业基本建设项目，其中限额以上的项目有七十八个。这些工厂的总的建筑面积，共达三百八十六万平方米；如果全部折合成宽二十米的厂房，连接在一起就有一百九十三公里长，可以由北京直排到张家口。
    首都工业基本建设的发展是与年俱增的。在去年和今年的大跃进中，建设规模之大和速度之快达到一个新的高峰。1949到1952年基建投资总额为八千九百多万元。1953至1957年的第一个五年计划期间，平均每年投资一亿九千万元，大跃进的1958年骤增为五亿九千万元。
    经过高速度的建设，现在首都已经有了一批作为工业骨干的现代化工厂，并且开辟了不少新的工业部门。
    第一，一个钢铁工业体系正在逐步形成。长期以来，北京一直是“有铁无钢”，更无钢材。去年大办钢铁的运动中，以飞快的速度新建和扩建了特殊钢厂、北京钢厂、石景山钢铁公司转炉炼钢车间以及几个轧钢厂。今年可以生产三十几万吨钢，二十几万吨钢材。铁的产量也由1949年的二万六千吨增加到1958年的五十二万吨。从去年8月到现在，已先后建成了由六点五立米到一千立米容积的大小高炉二十二座，三吨到六吨的转炉十七座。冶金工业所必需的炼焦工业、矿石开采工业和耐火材料工业也正在迅速兴起。
    第二，机械工业由修配跨进到制造。解放前，北京只有破破烂烂的三家铁路修理工厂和九个军械修造所。现在，已先后建成了机床厂、农业机械厂、机车车辆制造厂、汽车制造厂、电机制造厂、建筑机械制造厂、金属结构厂、印刷机械制造厂和各种精密仪表制造厂。机械工业的产值已在全市工业总产值中占到三分之一以上。1958年北京机械工业产品，仅金属切削机床一项，即达五十多种共四千七百七十台。
    第三，煤炭工业、电力工业，十年中也有了高速度的发展，先后新建和改建了十一座现代化的矿井，使煤的生产能力提高了二百万吨。发电设备的容量，也由五万八千瓩增加到二十七万瓩。
    第四，解放前一片空白的无线电工业，现在已经出现了规模巨大的现代化电子管厂、无线电器材厂、有线电厂以及广播器材厂，组成了一个强大的无线电制造中心。
    第五，棉纺工业从无到有，毛纺工业从粗到精。解放前的北京是“只能织布不会纺纱”，所需棉纱全部仰赖外地供应。现在以国棉第一、二、三厂为中心，加上在城区、郊区的若干小型的纺织厂，已经拥有纱锭二十五万枚，布机一万零三百二十台。北京清河制呢厂、北京毛纺厂生产的高级绒呢，已赢得了国内外市场的盛誉。
    第六，北京的化学工业过去基本上也是一片空白，现在已建成了玻璃、制药、搪瓷、化肥、塑料、合成纤维、炼焦化学等一系列的化工厂，使这个重要的工业部门初具规模。
    另外，在轻工业、建筑材料工业等方面，也涌现了大批新的工厂。在城区、郊区，还有大量的中、小型的、土的洋的或土洋结合的工厂，像雨后春笋般地生长起来。1958年大跃进中，各郊区就建成数千个农具制造、土化肥、粮食加工和造酒制糖等工厂或作坊，制造了六十多万件农具，成万吨的土化肥。
    这一系列工业的迅速成长，特别是去年的大跃进和今年的继续跃进，标志着首都在向现代化工业城市这个伟大目标的进程中，已经迈出了决定性的一步。（附图片）
