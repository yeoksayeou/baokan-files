Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 14th (TASS dispatch): The attention of the entire United States is now focused on Andrews Air Force Base, twenty-five kilometers from Washington, where the "Tu-114" aircraft carrying the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, who will pay an official visit to the American capital, will land.

The American public has shown great interest in Khrushchev's visit. The interest of Americans in the Soviet Union, the life of the Soviet people, and the brilliant achievements of Soviet science and technology has suddenly increased.

The "New Leader" magazine wrote, "We are surrounded by a wave of pro-Soviet sentiment... Most news organizations are focusing primarily on reports from Russia or about Russia, about Russian life, achievements, and hopes.

An unprecedented number of American and foreign journalists will cover and report on Khrushchev's visit to the United States.

White, the press officer of the U.S. State Department, said that 2,000 American and foreign journalists representing about 400 newspapers, radio stations, and television stations around the world will be responsible for reporting on Khrushchev's visit.

Three hundred journalists, including one hundred foreign journalists, will directly accompany the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on his visit, with four special planes available for their use. White said that there has never been an event with so many journalists covering it. (Attached photo)

    新华社日15讯　据塔斯社华盛顿14日讯：现在，美国全国的注意力都集中在离华盛顿二十五公里的安德鲁斯机场上，将到美国首都作正式访问的苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫乘的“图—114”式飞机将在那里着陆。
    美国公众对赫鲁晓夫的访问表现了极大的兴趣。美国人对苏联，对苏联人民的生活，对苏联科学技术的辉煌成就的兴趣猛然提高。
    “新领袖”杂志写道，“我们被对苏联友好的浪潮所包围……多数新闻机关都把主要注意力放在来自俄国或关于俄国、关于俄国的生活、成就和希望的报道上。
    将有空前多的美国记者和外国记者采访和报道赫鲁晓夫对美国的访问。
    美国国务院新闻发布官怀特说，将有美国和外国的二千名记者负责报道赫鲁晓夫的访问，这些记者代表着全世界的约四百家各种报刊、广播电台和电视台。
    直接随同苏联部长会议主席访问的将有三百名记者，其中包括一百名外国记者；有四架专机供他们使用。怀特说，至今还没有过任何一件事情有这样多的记者来报道。（附图片）
