    Following the Long March Road…
    ——Filming Notes on "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains"
    By Our Reporter Hong Helin
    The turbulent waves of the Dadu River surged forward, a long "fire dragon" rapidly dancing along the cliffs on the bank. It turned out to be Red Army soldiers holding torches "racing" against the river, trying to seize the ferry crossing before the "White Army" and cross this natural barrier. These are some of the opening shots of the color film "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains." "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" also has many such magnificent scenes; the epic pictures of thousands of troops crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands are inspiring and make the viewer feel as if they are there. In order to allow the audience to see the most arduous part of the Long March and the Red Army's invincible revolutionary will on the screen, the entire crew of "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" climbed snow mountains, crossed grasslands, trekked more than 4,000 kilometers, and put in nearly fifteen months of hard work.
    This film is a joint production of the "August First" Film Studio and the Beijing Film Studio, based on Chen Qitong's play of the same name.
Dadu Bridge with Icy Iron Chains - The audience can see the thrilling scene of Red Army soldiers climbing across the iron chain bridge in the movie. This scene was filmed on location at the Luding Bridge by the entire crew. This was a risky undertaking. The Dadu River was swift and cold, and the Luding Iron Chain Bridge was shaky. Who dared to climb back and forth on the iron chains?
    However, the crew was determined to "make a good film as a gift to the National Day." They put forward the slogan "Learn from the Red Army's fearless spirit." They said, "What the Red Army can do, why can't we do it!"
    When filming officially began, safety nets were set up under the iron chain bridge, and many emergency boats were deployed. Cinematographer Gao Hongtao stood on a specially constructed wooden platform extending from the side of the bridge to the water surface and started the camera. The director, script supervisor, and others also directed operations on the platform. The Red Army soldier (played by Zhang Shaohu) crawled along the iron chains against the rain of bullets, his eyes glaring at the enemy on the opposite bank, an indestructible spirit encouraging him to move forward bravely. A wonderful close-up was thus filmed.
    When the first shot of a Red Army soldier being injured and falling into the water was filmed, a dummy was used, which did not look real enough, so it was decided to film it again with a real person. The set worker Qi Hanwen volunteered to play the role. People laid thick quilts on the safety net under the bridge for him. This brave "soldier" fell from the bridge three times in a row, finally leaving this rare scene on film.
    The most courageous and tenacious were the lighting workers. Their task was to pull more than a dozen heavy wires across the bridge, tie them to the iron chains, and light the lamps. They had to climb farther than the actors and work while straddling the iron chains, where it was impossible to set up safety nets and lifeboats due to the rapid river flow. Moreover, in order not to reveal the traces of the wires in the shot, they climbed to the center of the river, fifty or sixty meters away from the bridgehead, wearing safety belts. They tied the wires each time they shot a scene until all the shots on the bridge were completed.
        Fighting Wind and Snow on Mount Que'er
    Braving the cold wind of minus twenty or thirty degrees Celsius, the crew arrived at the snow line of Mount Que'er, five thousand and fifty meters above sea level. According to insiders, this is probably the highest place a feature film location crew has ever been. The air is thin here, and the wind speed is very high. The camera was so frozen that it could not turn. The cinematographer had to put this treasure in his arms, keeping it warm while shooting. Famous actors Lan Ma (playing the instructor) and Liang Yuru (playing Deputy Battalion Commander Luo) filmed the scene of crossing the snow-capped mountain here. The actors' feelings on location were different from those in the studio. Lan Ma said that only by personally stepping on the peaks of the snow mountain can one truly appreciate the heroic spirit of the Red Army in those years. Liang Yuru also said that recalling the arduous and heroic fighting spirit of the Red Army, we completely forgot the cold.
    A tense scene on Mount Que'er was the "Red Army Ski Slope." This snow slope was more than 100 meters long from top to bottom, with a slope of more than 60 degrees. During filming, red flags fluttered up and down the snow slope, snow powder flew everywhere, and people shouted. The actors scrambled to slide down, each rolling into a "snowman." This scene was filmed four times in a row, and the snow in many places on the slope had been "rolled" clean, exposing the hard rocks. The actors' trousers were torn, and some of their hands and feet were cut, but they still insisted on finishing the shot. Sometimes they worked continuously on the mountain for seven or eight hours, baking frozen buns for lunch, and quenching their thirst by holding snow in their mouths when there was no water to drink. In this way, the crew worked on the snow mountain for four days, completing the filming of "The Wumeng Mountains Roll Along Like Mud Balls." Readers can see this great scene in the photo below.
    Marching on the Grasslands Recalling the Past
    The actors said that although the Dadu River and the snow mountains were arduous, they were not as difficult as the grasslands. The crew "camped" on the grasslands and spent nearly a month of outdoor life. They left Beijing wearing single clothes and put on cotton-padded jackets when they arrived on the grasslands. The water on the vast grasslands was knee-deep, and there was no way to go. Some places were like "spring beds," making it particularly difficult to walk. Even young men were sweating profusely after walking a few hundred meters. At night, large mosquitoes and ants launched a full-scale attack, disturbing people's sleep. However, how could these small difficulties overwhelm heroes! The actors regarded life on the grasslands as an unforgettable exercise and baptism. Because the weather on the grasslands was unpredictable during the day, the crew often "snatched the sun at nine o'clock in the morning" to shoot scenes, so the actors fearlessly threw themselves into the water marshes in the early morning. When filming the scene of soldiers falling into the cracks in the grasslands, a "man-made pit" was specially dug because it was dangerous to fall into real cracks. Who knew that during one filming, a horse suddenly fell into a real crack and was pulled out after being rescued for half an hour. The clever cinematographer quickly seized this rare opportunity and filmed enough. As a result, a wonderful scene of "Man and Horse Battle the Trap" was added to the film.

### 沿着长征的道路……——“万水千山”拍摄散记

    沿着长征的道路……
    ——“万水千山”拍摄散记
    本报记者　洪和临
    大渡河的惊涛骇浪汹涌奔腾，岸边峭壁旁一条长长的“火龙”在迅疾地飞舞向前。原来是手持火把的红军战士在同河水“赛跑”，他们要和“白军”抢占渡口，越过这条天险。这是彩色影片“万水千山”开始时的几个镜头。“万水千山”中还有许多这样气势雄伟的场景，那千军万马跨雪山越草地的史诗般的画面，看了使人精神奋发，宛如身临其境。为了使观众在银幕上看到长征途中最艰苦的一段历程和红军不可战胜的革命意志，“万水千山”摄制组全体人员曾经攀雪山、过草地，跋涉四千余公里，付出了近十五个月的辛勤劳动。
    这部影片是由“八一”电影制片厂、北京电影制片厂根据陈其通的同名话剧共同摄制的。大渡桥横铁索寒观众可以从电影上看到红军战士爬越铁索桥的惊心动魄的场面。这个场面是全体摄制工作人员到泸定桥现场拍摄的。这是冒险的尝试。大渡河水既急又冷，泸定铁索桥又摇摇晃晃，谁敢从铁索上爬来爬去呢？
    但是，摄制组的工作人员，一定要“拍出好影片向国庆献礼”。他们提出了“向红军大无畏的精神学习”的口号。他们说：“红军能做到的，我们为什么做不到！”
    正式开拍时，铁索桥下张起了防护网，布置了许多救急船。摄影师高洪涛站在特设的、从桥侧延伸到水面的木台上开动了摄影机，导演、场记等也在台上指挥操作。只见红军战士（张绍虎饰）迎着弹雨爬行在铁索上，他举目怒视着对岸的敌人，一种无坚不摧的精神在鼓舞着他勇往直前。一个精采的特写就此拍成了。
    当第一次拍制红军受伤落水的镜头时使用了一个假人，显得不够真实，因此决定再用真人拍一次。置景工人齐汉文自告奋勇演这个角色。人们在桥下的防护网上为他铺好了厚厚的棉被，这位英勇的“战士”连续三次从桥上飞落下去，终于使这个难得的场面留在胶片上。
    最勇敢、顽强的要算照明工人了。他们的任务是把十几根笨重的电线拉过桥，绑在铁索上，点亮照明灯。他们要比演员爬得更远，并且要骑在铁索上工作，而这里由于河水流急，无法设置防护网和救生船。又为使镜头内不露电线痕迹，他们系着保险带爬到离桥头五、六十米的河心，拍一个镜头，扎一次线，直到桥上镜头全部拍完。
        雀儿山上搏风雪
    冒着零下二、三十度的寒风，摄制组人员来到拔海五千零五十米的雀儿山雪线上。据内行人说，这恐怕是迄今为止故事片外景队所到过的最高的地方了。这里空气稀薄，风速很大。摄影机冻得转不动了，摄影师只好把这个宝贝揣在怀里，边保温边拍摄。著名演员蓝马（饰教导员）、梁玉儒（饰罗副营长）等在这里拍下了横跨雪山的镜头。演员们在这样的现场拍外景，感受是和在摄影棚里不同的。蓝马说，只有亲自踏在雪山的高峰上，才能体会到红军当年的英雄气概。梁玉儒也说，想起了当年红军艰苦卓绝的战斗精神，我们完全忘记了寒冷。
    雀儿山上的一个紧张镜头是“红军滑雪坡”。这雪坡从上到下长达一百多米，坡度达到六十度以上。拍摄时，雪坡上下红旗招展，雪粉横飞，人声鼎沸，演员们争先恐后地滑下去，个个都滚成了“雪人”。这个场面连拍了四次，坡上许多地方的雪已经被“滚”净了，露出硬硬的山石。演员们的裤子被撕破了，有的手脚被划破，但演员们依然坚持拍完了这一镜头，有时连续在山上工作七、八个小时，烤烤冻馒头当做午饭，没有水喝时就含口雪聊以解渴。就这样摄制组在雪山工作了四天，完成了“乌蒙磅礴走泥丸”的拍摄工作。读者可以从下面这张照片上看到这一伟大的场面。
    草地行军忆当年
    演员们说，大渡河、雪山虽艰苦，但苦不过草地。摄制组在草地“安营扎寨”，过了近一个月的野外生活。他们从北京出发穿单衣，到了草地就穿起棉袄。茫茫无际的草地上水深及膝，欲行无路。有些地方好像“弹簧床”，走起来格外吃力，连年青的小伙子走上几百米也都汗流满面。夜晚大蚊子、大蚂蚁又全线进攻，扰得人不能安眠。但是，这一点点困难怎能难倒英雄汉！演员们把草地的生活当做一次难忘的锻炼和洗礼。由于草地白天晴雨不定，摄制组常常“抢早上九点钟的太阳”来拍戏，于是演员们毫不畏惧地投身在清晨的水沼里。在拍摄战士落入草地裂缝的场面时，因为落入真裂缝里很危险，特意挖了一个“人造坑”。谁知一次拍戏时，一匹马突然掉进了真的裂缝中，救了半个多钟头才拉出来。聪明的摄影师赶紧抓住了这个难得的机会拍了一个够。于是影片上就增加了一个“人马大战陷坑”的精彩镜头。
