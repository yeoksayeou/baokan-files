Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: In the research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scattered throughout the country, a surge of enthusiasm has been generated to respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions of striving for advancement and dedicating new scientific research achievements to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Each research unit has contributed several relatively important scientific achievements, with some contributing dozens. What is presented here is just a bouquet of many gifts.

　　　　3.2 Centimeter Radio Telescope
    The 3.2-centimeter wavelength radio telescope, made by the Preparatory Office of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Electronics during the Great Leap Forward last year, has been put into regular observation of solar radiation after adjustments this year. According to the statistics of several months of observation results, the data of solar radiation temperature has been obtained. The relationship between sunspot area and radio radiation has been determined, and three times the sudden increase of 3.2-centimeter wavelength radiation during solar flare eruptions has been detected.

　　　　Using Aluminum Wire to Replace Enamelled Copper Wire
    The electrical industry needs a large amount of enamelled wire and yarn-covered wire. These wires are made of copper, which is a metal with relatively low production and extremely high demand. Now, the Institute of Applied Chemistry has researched and developed an aluminum wire to replace copper. After chemical treatment, this aluminum wire generates an insulating layer on the surface, which has the same insulating effect as the paint and yarn of enamelled and yarn-covered copper wires. Therefore, it can replace enamelled copper wire and yarn-covered copper wire in the manufacture of motors and other equipment. In addition to saving copper, this aluminum wire has the following advantages over enamelled and yarn-covered copper wire: good wear resistance; no reaction with organic solvents; can withstand very high temperatures. Therefore, its application in the electrical industry can save a large amount of copper materials.

　　　　New Type of Plastic
    Polyformaldehyde is a new type of polymer compound with good electrical insulation and wear resistance, high melting point, and high crystallinity. It can be used as a mechanical material and also as daily necessities. In addition to being used as plastic, it can also be made into films and fibers.
    Polyformaldehyde can be made into excellent polymer materials. It has only been successfully researched in the world in recent years.
    Inspired by the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year, the Institute of Chemistry broke down superstitions and boldly seized this research. In just two months, polyformaldehyde samples were made in the laboratory. Since 1959, researchers have continued to study and discovered key issues in improving quality, and have achieved some good results. They are currently working closely with production departments to conduct intermediate expansion tests for large-scale production in China.

　　　　First Automatic Calculation Device for Power Systems
    The Institute of Electrical Engineering completed the research and trial production of China's first automatic calculation device for power system swing curves ahead of schedule. After appraisal, the calculation accuracy of the device has reached the degree to meet the needs of actual engineering applications.
    This set of calculation devices, used in conjunction with the AC calculation table, can realize the automation of the calculation process for complex power system stability problems.
    In large-scale power systems for long-distance power transmission, stability calculation is a very important and cumbersome task. Using this automatic calculation device can greatly improve the working speed and simplify the operation process compared to the general use of manual operation and semi-automatic operation, and can reduce calculation errors.

　　　　New Method for Analyzing Petroleum Composition
    With the vigorous development of the motherland's petroleum industry and scientific research, there is an increasingly urgent need for a rapid method to analyze the composition of petroleum. Analyzing the composition of petroleum with "chromatography" is not only accurate, fast, and convenient, but it can also solve the analysis and separation problems of many extremely complex mixtures that cannot be solved by other methods. Moreover, the required equipment is extremely simple and cheap, and consumes very few samples. After several years of research, the Petroleum Institute has now been able to use this method to analyze various components in natural and artificial petroleum.

　　　　Vaporization Cooling of Blast Furnace Tuyeres
    Metallurgical production is a high-temperature process. In order to maintain the normal operation of equipment, a large amount of water is needed for cooling. The life of a blast furnace depends not only on the quality of refractory materials, but also mainly on the quality of cooling. Producing one ton of iron requires twenty to thirty tons of water. Therefore, every metallurgical factory must have a lake-like pool and a huge water supply system. The use of vaporization cooling is to greatly reduce the consumption of water while ensuring good cooling of the blast furnace. This new cooling method has recently been preliminarily successfully tested by the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Black Metallurgical Design Institute.

　　　　Large Number of Paleontological Fossils Unearthed in Inner Mongolia
    The "Central Asian Paleontological Expedition Team" jointly organized by Chinese and Soviet paleontologists launched its 1959 expedition in Erenhot and other areas of Inner Mongolia in early June. In the three months up to late August, the team conducted route explorations of more than 8,000 kilometers and systematic fossil excavation work at twelve locations including the Erenhot Salt Lake and Irdin Manha, excavating a large number of fossils, including mainly hadrosaur fossils and ornithomimosaur fossils, as well as turtle and crocodile fossils. In addition, there are also sauropod dinosaur fossils discovered here for the first time, as well as primitive mammalian fossils that people previously knew very little about.
    Due to the large scale of this expedition team, new excavation methods were adopted in the excavation work, and modern mechanical equipment such as bulldozers were applied, which brought paleontological field excavation work into a new stage. The work in the past three months is almost equivalent to the harvest of the American expedition team's nearly ten years of work in the above-mentioned areas from 1921 to 1930.

　　　　High-Temperature Cement and Refractory Concrete
    With the development of the steelmaking industry, the need for refractory materials, especially advanced refractory materials, is increasing day by day. The Metallurgical Ceramics Research Institute has recently combined China's resource conditions with a policy suitable for blooming everywhere, using certain readily available materials to manufacture high-temperature cement and refractory concrete to replace advanced refractory materials, solving the tension in the supply of magnesite, which has always been used as an alkaline refractory raw material; the manufacturing process is simpler than that of ordinary refractory materials, and the production cost is low; it can be made into complex shapes of objects and integrated refractory buildings, which is convenient for mechanized construction and improves the service life of furnace linings.
    The result of the partial trial use of this concrete block on a steelmaking converter is very good, and it is initially proved that it can be used as a steelmaking furnace lining material.

　　　　New Progress in Seawater Desalination Experiment
    A seawater desalination device with a daily output of 300 kilograms of fresh water is undergoing field trials in Qingdao, and the operation is good. The desalination device was jointly trial-produced by the Institute of Chemistry and other relevant departments.
    This desalination device has a volume of less than 0.15 cubic meters and weighs about 100 kilograms. It already has practical value. Now, distillation is generally used to desalinate seawater, which is costly. Using this desalination device is much cheaper in comparison.

    响应八中全会号召　力争上游迎接国庆
    一批科学研究新成果献给祖国
    新华社25日讯　在中国科学院分布全国各地的研究机构里，以力争上游的实际行动响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，用新的科学研究成果向建国十周年献礼，已经形成热潮。每个研究单位献出的比较重要科学成果少则数项，多则数十项。这里介绍的只是许多礼品中的一束。
          三点二厘米无线电望远镜
    中国科学院北京天文台筹备处和电子学研究所在去年大跃进中制成的波长三点二厘米的无线电望远镜，经过今年的调整，目前已经投入了太阳辐射的正规观测，根据几个月来观测结果的统计得出了太阳辐射温度的数据；求出了太阳黑子面积与无线电辐射的关系，并有三次侦察出了在太阳上耀斑爆发时三点二厘米波长辐射的突增。
            用铝线代替漆包铜线
    电气工业需要大量的漆包线和纱包线。这些线都是用铜做的，而铜是产量较少而需用量极大的金属。现在应用化学研究所研究出了用一种代替铜的铝线。这种铝线经过化学处理后，在表面生成一层绝缘层，和漆包线、纱包线的漆和纱一样有绝缘作用，所以可以代替漆包铜线和纱包铜线制造电机等设备。这种铝线除了可以节约铜外，比起漆包纱包铜线来还有下列优点：耐磨性能良好；不会和有机溶剂起作用；可以耐很高的温度，因此应用在电气工业中可以节省大量铜制材料。
                新型塑料
    聚甲醛是一种新型的高分子化合物，具有良好的电绝缘性和耐磨性，高融点，高结晶度，可作机械用材料，也可作日用品，除作塑料外，还可制成薄膜和纤维。
    聚甲醛能作成优良的高分子材料，世界上也是在最近几年中才研究成功的。
    化学研究所在去年大跃进的形势鼓舞下，破除迷信，大胆地抓住了这项研究，仅两个月的时间，在实验室内做出了聚甲醛样品。1959年以来，研究工作者继续钻研，发现了提高质量的关键性问题，取得了一些较好的结果，目前正和生产部门密切合作，为在我国大规模生产，进行着中间扩大试验。
        第一台电力系统自动计算装置
    电工研究所提前完成了我国第一台电力系统摇摆曲线自动计算装置的研究和试制工作。经过鉴定，装置的计算精确度已达到满足实际工程应用的程度。
    这套计算装置配合交流计算台使用，可以实现复杂电力系统稳定问题的计算过程自动化。
    在远距离输电的大型电力系统中，稳定计算是一项很重要的工作，也是一项很繁琐的工作，采用这种自动计算装置以后，比起一般采用人工操作和半自动化操作，可以在很大程度上提高工作速度和简化操作过程，并可减少计算的错误。
          分析石油组成的新方法
    随着祖国石油工业和科学研究事业的蓬勃发展，愈来愈迫切地需要快速的分析石油组成的方法，用“色谱法”分析石油组成不但准确迅速简便，可以解决许多用其他的方法不能解决的极复杂混合物的分析分离问题，而且所需设备又极简单便宜，耗费样品很少。石油研究所经过几年的研究，现在已经能够用这种方法来分析天然和人造石油中的各种成分。
            高炉风口汽化冷却
    冶金生产为一种高温过程，为了维持设备能够经常正常地运转，就需要大量的水来进行冷却。高炉的寿命除决定于耐火材料的质量外，更主要的还是决定于冷却情况的好坏。生产一吨铁需要二十—三十吨水。因此每一个冶金工厂都必须备有像湖一样大的水池和庞大的供水系统。采用汽化冷却就是在确保高炉良好冷却的情况下来大大减少水的消耗量。这种新的冷却方法最近已由化工冶金研究所、石景山钢铁公司、黑色冶金设计院合作初步试验成功。
        内蒙古大批古生物化石出土
    由中苏两国古生物学者共同组织的“亚洲中部古生物考察队”今年6月上旬在内蒙古二连等地区展开了1959年度的考察工作。到8月下旬的三个月里进行了长达八千公里以上的路线探查和在二连盐池、伊尔丁曼纳等十二个地点进行了系统的化石发掘工作，发掘到大量的化石，其中主要的有鸭嘴龙类化石和似乌龙类化石，还有龟鳄类等。此外，还有在这里第一次发现的蜥脚类恐龙化石，以及以前人们知道得很少的原始哺乳类化石。
    由于这次考察队的规模较大，在发掘工作中采用了新的发掘方法，应用了推土机等现代化机械设备，使古生物学的野外发掘工作跨入新的阶段。三个月来的工作，差不多等于过去美国考察队于1921年到1930年在上述地区将近工作十年的收获。
          高温水泥与耐火混凝土
    随着炼钢工业的发展，耐火材料、特别是高级耐火材料的需要日益增加，冶金陶瓷研究所在最近结合我国的资源条件和适于遍地开花的方针，利用某种易得材料制造高温水泥和耐火混凝土，代替高级耐火材料，解决了一向用作碱性耐火原料的镁砂供应的紧张；比一般耐火材料制造工艺简单，生产成本低；可以制成形状复杂的物件和整体的耐火建筑物，便于机械化施工和提高炉衬使用寿命。
    这种混凝土制成的砌块在炼钢转炉上部分试用的结果很好，初步证明可以用作炼钢炉衬材料使用。
          海水淡化试验的新进展
    一种日产三百公斤淡水的海水淡化器，在青岛实地试验，运转情况良好。淡化器是化学研究所和其他有关部门协作试制出来的。
    这种淡化器体积不到零点一五立方米，重量约一百公斤，已经具有实用价值，现在一般用蒸馏的方法，淡化海水耗费较大，用这种淡化器，比较起来要便宜得多。
