Xinhua News Agency, 24th: During the construction of the Great Hall of the People, cadres from state organs, officers and soldiers, teachers and students from schools, and the masses of citizens contributed 300,000 person-trips to the labor.

In the past ten months or so, people living in the capital have loved to use this sentence to express mutual concern: "Have you worked on the construction site of the Great Hall of the People?" A cadre labor brigade headquarters was established at the construction site, and people from all walks of life were organized in batches to take turns working. Among the labor force, there were leaders and generals from some central ministries, as well as cadres from Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Yi, and Uyghur ethnic groups. They all competed to contribute their share of strength to this Great Hall of the People for 600 million people. Even if they were moving a brick or transporting a small cart of soil, they tried every means to ensure that it fully met the requirements of the project and ensured the quality of the project. Sometimes, when they discovered even the slightest problem, they immediately wrote reports or suggestions and sent them to the construction leadership department. When some cadres from the Ministry of Commerce were transporting building materials, they built bridges over ditches, smoothed the roads, and used waste materials to repair vehicles, increasing transportation efficiency by two to four times. In June of this year, more than 100 female cadres from central state organs came to the construction site to undertake the task of packaging and sewing cinder asbestos bags. Several female cadres saw that it was very difficult for people to sew cinder asbestos bags by hand, so the next day they transported their sewing machines from home to the construction site and used machines instead of manual operation, which quickly increased work efficiency by more than doubled. Many cadres acted as assistants to the workers during labor, lifting poles or pushing earth, and all kinds of work were done quickly and well. Some cadres also learned some simple construction techniques while working with experienced workers. Some cadres from the Ministry of Coal Industry, under the guidance of stonemasons, participated in the technically demanding work of chopping axe stones, and the quality of their work was very good, and was praised by the workers.

Many organ cadres and school teachers and students, during tense labor, also used their rest time to carry out a variety of service work for the workers. Cadres from the Broadcasting Administration Bureau took on the task of broadcasting and publicity for the entire construction site during labor, enlivening the construction site life and inspiring the workers' enthusiasm. Cadres from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education and other units helped workers' teams and groups run construction site blackboards and literacy training classes. Some cadres set up service stations on the construction site to carry out service activities such as mending clothes and writing letters, which were welcomed by the workers.

    争先恐后为人民大会堂贡献力量
    首都三十万人次参加义务劳动
    新华社24日讯　在人民大会堂的建设中，国家机关干部、部队官兵、学校师生和市民群众有三十万人次参加了劳动。
    在过去的十个多月里，生活在首都的人们，见面后爱用这末一句话来表达相互间的关心：“你去人民大会堂工地劳动过没有？”工地上成立了干部劳动大队部，有计划地组织各界人民分批轮换来劳动。在劳动队伍中，有中央一些部的领导人和将军，也有藏、蒙古、回、彝、维吾尔等民族干部。他们都争先恐后为这座六亿人民的大会堂献出自己的一分力量。他们尽管是搬一块砖或运一小车土，都千方百计想尽办法，做到完全合乎工程的要求，确保工程质量。有时，发现一点一滴的问题，都立即写出报告或建议书，送给施工领导部门。商业部一些干部在运送建筑材料时，见沟搭桥，铺平道路，并且利用废材料动手修理车子，把运输效率提高二至四倍。今年6月，中央国家机关有一百多名女干部来到工地，担任包装缝制矿碴石棉袋的任务。有几个女干部看到人们用手缝制矿碴石棉袋很费劲，第二天就把自己家里缝纫机运到工地，用机器代替手工操作，工作效率迅速提高了一倍以上。许多干部在劳动中当工人下手，抬杆子或推土，样样活都干得又快又好。有些干部在配合老师傅干活时，还学到一些简单的建筑技术。煤炭工业部一些干部在石工师傅指导的下，参加技术要求较高的剁斧石工作，做出的活质量很好，受到工人的称赞。
    许多机关干部和学校师生，在紧张劳动中，还利用休息的时间，为工人开展了多种多样的服务工作。广播事业局的干部在劳动时，担任起整个工地的广播宣传工作，活跃了工地生活，鼓舞了工人干劲。文化部和教育部等单位的干部，帮助工人队组办工地黑板报和扫盲训练班。有些干部在工地上设置服务站，开展缝补衣服、代写书信等服务活动，受到工人的欢迎。
