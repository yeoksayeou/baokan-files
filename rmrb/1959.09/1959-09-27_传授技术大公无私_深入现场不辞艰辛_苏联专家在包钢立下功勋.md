    Selflessly Imparting Technology, Braving Hardship Deep in the Field:
    Soviet Experts Establish Meritorious Service in Baogang

    (Baotou, September 26) This newspaper reports: The newly built Baogang No. 1 automated large blast furnace is a fruitful result of the great Sino-Soviet friendship. This automated large blast furnace, from the preliminary design and technical design to the construction, has received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union.

    The design task of the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace system was quite arduous. In particular, because the Baiyun Obo iron ore contains many other metallic components, the comrades preparing to build Baogang were very worried about whether this kind of ore could be used to refine good iron. To this end, the technicians of the Leningrad branch of the Soviet Black Metal Metallurgical Design Institute, who were responsible for the preliminary design and technical design of the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace system, collected information on the ore composition for research, and put forward many special designs for the furnace lining and mechanical equipment of the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace.

    Professor Xiao Mike, a Soviet expert lecturing at the Northeast Institute of Technology, heard that the comrades of Baogang encountered difficulties in the ore test, and specially took time to Beijing to help with the ore test. During the trial refining, the first two times failed, so he stayed by the furnace all night. After more than a month of painstaking research, the trial refining was finally successful.

    The Soviet Union not only provided the most advanced design for the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace, but also sent dozens of excellent experts to help the Baogang workers build such a world-class large blast furnace at the fastest speed. The Soviet expert group headed by Stebanski often worked on the construction site, whether in the cold winter or the hot summer, to understand the situation and find problems. They put forward many valuable suggestions in improving enterprise management, ensuring quality, saving materials, and speeding up progress. When pouring the concrete foundation of the blast furnace, Stebanski found that the quality of the welded steel bars was unqualified, so he personally went down into the foundation pit to guide the workers to change the operation method. He often paid attention to the overall progress of the No. 1 blast furnace system project, and when he found that the progress of those projects was lagging behind, he proposed measures to speed up the progress. When the No. 1 blast furnace system project entered the final stage, he moved to the blast furnace construction site to work, guiding workers in operation. In the bricklaying of the blast furnace, ironmaking expert Shirovatk came to the furnace every day to guide the workers on how to ensure the quality of bricklaying. He often climbed into the confined space that one couldn't straighten up in, teaching the workers how to build quickly and well. When the main hoist of the blast furnace was being debugged for electrical equipment, electrical expert Kaznacheyev fell ill. The doctor suggested that he rest, but he said: Iron is about to be produced, and the debugging work must be completed as soon as possible. I can't rest. When blowing expert Chernov was guiding the installation of the blower, he put on his work clothes and worked with the workers, without leaving the site for twenty-four consecutive hours. In order to help the workers understand the various most advanced electrical equipment of the No. 1 blast furnace system, Kaznacheyev systematically explained the electrical principles of the blast furnace to the workers more than ten times; once he explained the installation principle of the synchronous motor of the No. 4 pumping station to the workers overnight, and it was almost dawn when he returned.

    The Soviet Union's relevant factories also supplied Baogang with high-quality and technologically advanced machinery and equipment. The Soviet government sent economic delegations twice to understand the problems and difficulties in the construction of Baogang. When they heard that the Baogang workers were working hard and striving to produce iron ahead of schedule, they took the initiative to propose that most of the equipment needed by Baogang could be delivered ahead of schedule. The three-machine converter unit used for the DC power supply of the blast furnace loading system was stipulated in the contract to be delivered at the end of the second quarter of this year. In order to meet the requirements of the blast furnace for producing iron ahead of schedule, the Ural Electric Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which was responsible for manufacturing this equipment, sent the machine on April 9, which provided a reliable guarantee for the power supply of the blast furnace system at that time.

### 传授技术大公无私　深入现场不辞艰辛  苏联专家在包钢立下功勋

    传授技术大公无私　深入现场不辞艰辛
    苏联专家在包钢立下功勋
    本报包头26日电　新建的包钢一号自动化大型高炉，是伟大的中苏友谊所结出的一颗硕果。这座自动化的大高炉，从初步设计、技术设计一直到施工，都得到苏联全面无私的帮助。
    包钢一号高炉系统的设计任务相当繁重。特别是由于白云鄂博铁矿石含有许多其他金属成分，筹建包钢的同志很耽心用这种矿石是否能炼出很好的铁。为此，担负包钢一号高炉系统初步设计和技术设计任务的苏联黑色金属冶金设计院列宁格勒分院的技术人员，曾收集了有关矿石成分的资料进行研究，对包钢一号高炉的炉衬和机械设备提出了许多特殊设计。
    在东北工学院讲学的苏联专家萧米克教授，听到包钢同志在矿石试验时遇到困难，特地抽空到北京帮助进行矿石试验。在试炼时，头两次失败了，他便成夜守在炉边，经过一个多月的苦心研究，终于试炼成功。
    苏联不仅为包钢一号高炉提供了最先进的设计，而且还派出数十名优秀的专家，帮助包钢职工以最快的速度，建设起这样一座世界第一流的大高炉。以斯捷班斯基为首的苏联专家组，不管是在严寒的冬天，还是炎热的夏日，都经常在工地上工作，了解情况，发现问题。他们在改进企业管理、保证质量、节约材料、加快进度等方面，提出许多宝贵建议。在浇灌高炉基础混凝土时，斯捷班斯基发现焊接钢筋质量不合格，便亲自下基础坑内，指导工人改变操作方法。他经常注意一号高炉系统工程的综合进度，发现那些工程进度赶不上，就提出加快进度的措施。在一号高炉系统工程进入结尾阶段时，他搬到高炉工地办公，指导工人操作。在高炉砌砖中，炼铁专家希洛瓦特克，每天都到炉内，指导工人如何保证砌砖质量，他常常爬到直不起腰来的围管里去，教工人们如何既快又好地进行砌筑。高炉主卷扬机正在紧张地进行电器设备调正时，电气专家卡兹那切也夫病了。医生建议让他休息，他说：快出铁了，调正工作必须尽早完成，我不能休息。鼓风专家切尔诺夫在指导安装鼓风机时，穿起工作服，和工人一起操作，连续二十四小时没有离开现场。为了帮助工人们了解一号高炉系统各种最先进的电气设备，卡兹那切也夫给工人们系统地讲解高炉电气原理十余次；有一次他给工人连夜讲解四号泵站同步电动机安装原理，讲完以后回去时已快天明了。
    苏联有关工厂还供给了包钢质量优良、技术先进的机器设备。苏联政府曾经两次派经济代表团来了解包钢建设中的问题和困难，当他们听说包钢职工正在大鼓干劲，力争提前出铁时，主动提出包钢所需要的设备，大部分可以提前到货。高炉装料系统直流电源用的三机变流机组，合同规定是今年二季度末交货，为了满足高炉提前出铁的要求，制造这项设备任务的乌拉尔电机机器制造厂，在4月9日就把机器发来了，使当时高炉系统的动力电源有了可靠的保证。（附图片）
