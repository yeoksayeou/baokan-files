Everyone believes that the worker's performing arts troupes have made outstanding achievements in striving to reflect the lives of workers, and the forms and themes are rich and diverse.

Everyone believes that the spirit of striving for the top and the hard work, simplicity, and frugality of the worker's performing arts troupes are particularly worthy of learning. Over the past few years, they have improved rapidly in art, and each play is better than the last. It is commendable that they can perform so many good plays with so few people and spending so little money. Some people believe that the "Flying Wing to Wing" performed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions worker's drama troupe is a very successful comedy in the drama field in the past two years, and has unique creations in dealing with the theme of contradictions among the people and learning to use national traditions. The dance "Ode to the Commune," "Before Going Down the Mine," "On the Train," and many songs, dances, and folk art programs such as "Leap Forward Family" and "Xiang Xiuli" have rich performance content and are full of emotion.

    参加国庆献花盛会
    工人文工团选出优秀节目
    新华社17日讯　最近结束的工人文工团观摩演出，选拔出许多优秀节目将参加首都庆祝建国十周年的文艺演出。
    在这次演出的节目中，话剧有表现大跃进的喜剧“比翼齐飞”，有反映历史革命斗争的“二七风暴”，歌剧有表现安源罢工的“珍珠墙”，还有神话舞剧“并蒂莲”和许多歌颂党、歌颂大跃进的歌舞、曲艺节目。这些节目将组成六个晚会，在百花荟萃的首都文艺演出中显示工人文工团十年来的努力和大跃进的成就。
    洋溢着跃进气氛的工人文工团观摩演出，受到首都文艺界的重视与关怀。首都一些著名艺术家欧阳予倩、老舍、陶钝、孙维世等观看了他们的演出，进行了亲切的交谈，对这次演出给予很高的评价。大家认为，工人文工团在力求反映工人生活方面做出了突出成绩，形式、题材丰富多样。由于他们深入工矿长年和工人在一起，因而在舞台上出色的塑造了各种工人和厂长、党委书记等人物的艺术形象，生动地表现出工人阶级的精神面貌和干劲。
    大家认为，工人文工团所表现的力争上游的精神和艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的作风特别值得学习，几年来他们在艺术上提高很快，一个戏比一个戏演得好，他们能用很少的人、花很少的钱演出这么多好戏，是难能可贵的。有人认为总工会工人话剧团演出的“比翼齐飞”，是近两年话剧界非常成功的一个喜剧，在处理人民内部矛盾的主题和学习运用民族传统方面都有独特的创造。舞蹈“公社颂”、“下井之前”、“在列车上”，曲艺“跃进家庭”、“向秀丽”等许多歌舞、曲艺节目的表演内容丰富，情绪饱满。
