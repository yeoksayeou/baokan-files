    Communes Create Conditions for Achieving Mechanization
    Zhou Youhe, Secretary of the Jiangning County Yangtze People's Commune Party Committee, Jiangsu Province

    The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call to the people of the whole country, demanding that the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan be completed three years ahead of schedule and that the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program be realized ahead of schedule. All cadres and members of our Yangtze People's Commune are determined to respond warmly to the Party's call with practical actions.

    I am a rural cadre. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, what I have felt most deeply is the enormous superiority shown by the people's communes. Take our Yangtze People's Commune as an example. The powerful vitality and unparalleled superiority it has shown in just one short year cannot be described even in three days and three nights. This year's summer harvest of three wheats (wheat, barley, naked barley) was a bumper harvest, the largest in the past twenty years. The per-mu yield and total output of more than 43,800 mu of three wheats in the entire commune increased by 61.3% compared with last year, and by 354.7% compared with the per-mu yield before liberation. When mentioning this bumper harvest, the members sing: "The commune is a flower, the flower blooms with big wheat ears, I've lived sixty-nine years, and never seen such crops. If you ask the reason, it's all thanks to the Communist Party, the people's communes are good, and machines are powerful." Indeed, the bumper harvest of three wheats, in addition to the implementation of the Eight-Character Charter, the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects, deep plowing, and close planting, the use of agricultural machinery and the full play of its efficiency were an important reason for our Yangtze Commune.

    Our fifty-li (approximately 16.7 miles) of continental land is on the edge of the Yangtze River. It was a barren continent and reed beach opened up twenty years ago by refugees fleeing famine from Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces. In the past, there was always more land, less livestock, and less labor. Each laborer had to bear fifteen mu of land, and cultivation often could not be timely, which affected large-scale production increases. In 1955, the state set up a horse-drawn farm implement station here, with three tractors to help farmers with cultivation. After the advanced cooperativization in 1956, according to the principle of relying on the masses to realize agricultural mechanization, the state handed over six tractors and other machines to the Yangtze Agricultural Cooperative, which at that time owned 24,642 mu of land and 2,212 member households. The members of this cooperative and other cooperatives were very happy to see these "iron oxen" cultivate large areas deeply and quickly. They thought: If all production used these things, how good would that be! They saw the bright prospects of agricultural mechanization and were willing to save on food and clothing, accumulate more, and strive to achieve mechanization as soon as possible. However, at that time, due to the small size and weak strength of the cooperatives, it was impossible to accumulate and purchase a large number of agricultural machines. For example, the Jiaozhou Agricultural Cooperative had a total annual income of only 4,500 yuan, and it could not afford even half a tractor. Even with the existing machines, because there was no repair shop in the countryside, once there was a problem, they had to be transported to nearby Changzhou or Nanjing for repair, which was costly and time-consuming, and could not fully exert the potential of the machines. The members reflected: "Tractors are good, but there is no way to repair them when they break down."

    After the Great Leap Forward and communization in 1958, these difficulties were swept away. The original sixteen advanced cooperatives formed a unified whole, which was truly large in scale, abundant in manpower, accumulated a lot, and had thick funds. In the autumn of 1958, we concentrated more than 400,000 yuan of public funds accumulated by various production teams and purchased a tractor, two harvesters, a large thresher, two 60-horsepower water pumps, and eight small water pumps. Adding the original machinery, the entire commune now has eight tractors, nine seeders, five disc harrows and tine harrows, two harvesters, one large thresher, and fifty-four water pumps, and four trailers.

    These agricultural machines, under the unified allocation of the commune, have given full play to their power. In the past, some advanced cooperatives had tractors and water pumps, and some did not. Because the advanced cooperatives operated independently, they could not be uniformly dispatched and used. Although those without tractors had insufficient labor and livestock power, they could only rely on their own strength to solve the problem slowly, which affected production. For example, the Binjiang Brigade had 4,000 mu of wheat fields. Before communization, the annual yield of three wheats was only 120 jin per mu due to insufficient livestock power and human plowing, because the season could not be grasped. After communization, the Binjiang Brigade used five tractors to cultivate the land, and cultivated more than 2,000 mu in just three days and nights. Due to the implementation of machine cultivation, the remaining more than 18,000 mu of three wheat fields in the entire commune were mostly cultivated with double-wheeled double-share plows, twenty days earlier than the autumn planting in 1957. After communization, we believed that we had the conditions to run a machine repair shop, so we started to train more than 80 technicians in driving and repairing tractors, and collected raw materials, parts, manpower, and materials related to machinery from various brigades to open a machine repair shop. This factory purchased a 50-kilowatt generator, which drove six lathes in three workshops, so that the machines could be repaired as soon as they broke down. As a result, the tractor drivers became even more motivated. During the autumn planting, inspired by the upsurge of communization, the members of the entire commune launched a vigorous deep plowing movement. At that time, although more than 3,500 people were transferred to support the iron and steel front, everyone worked day and night to grab the cultivation and planting. Eight tractors worked in shifts, with people stopping and machines not stopping, giving full play to the potential of the machines. The cultivation efficiency of each tractor was doubled compared to before, cultivating 200 mu per day and night, and also meeting the requirements of deep plowing. More than 15,000 mu of three wheat land in the entire commune were all deep plowed to more than eight inches.

    More than half of the land in the entire commune was cultivated by machines, which greatly alleviated the labor shortage, freeing up 947,500 labor days to strengthen fertilizer accumulation and field management. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in 1958 exceeded that of 1953 by eighteen times. The average amount of fertilizer applied to each mu of three wheats was 160 dan (approximately 15,873 pounds), an increase of 35% compared with the past, with three to four applications of topdressing. The work of weeding, pest control, and soil consolidation was also done more carefully.

    At the time of the wheat harvest, the speed was fast due to the thresher. One thresher could thresh 60,000 jin (approximately 66,139 pounds) of wheat a day. In this year's summer harvest, 1.5 million jin were threshed by machines. In the past, it was very laborious and slow to carry wheat and sell grain by people carrying and carts pushing. After communization, the self-run machine repair shop used old materials to modify three motorized trailers and a motorized sailboat, which saved 300,000 labor days in transportation.

    In the past, whenever there was heavy rain, human power was used for drainage, and the waterlogging problem in the wheat fields could not be fundamentally solved. After communization, in addition to the comprehensive renovation of the drainage and irrigation system, 54 water pumps were collectively added, ensuring that the water level in the ditches and ponds was reduced by three feet, and the average groundwater level in the wheat fields was also reduced by eight inches to one foot compared with the same period in 1957, even if there was 100 millimeters of heavy rain, there would be no waterlogging, ensuring the normal growth of three wheats.

    Under the threat of this year's severe drought, we have given full play to the great power of the commune and the machines, so that 80% of the paddy fields and dry land in the entire commune have been irrigated by machines. The crops are growing particularly vigorously and strongly, and another bumper harvest is already in sight.

    The facts of the past year eloquently show that the people's communes are far superior to agricultural cooperatives in giving full play to the efficiency of agricultural machinery. After the implementation of mechanized cultivation, some of the agricultural work with high labor intensity has been replaced by machines. After transplanting seedlings every year, it takes at least three months to step on the water manually under the hot sun; now water pumps are used to replace manual stepping on water. In particular, women no longer bear heavy work, but only do some relatively light weeding, topdressing, pest control, and other agricultural work. During the busy spring and autumn seasons every year, the most labor is spent on cultivating the land. In the past, this kind of agricultural work was mostly done by nine to twelve laborers pulling a plow, but they could only cultivate eight fen (approximately 0.8 acres) of land a day; now all of them are replaced by machines and double-share plows.

    Because the labor intensity has been reduced, the members can participate in cultural and technical schools in the evening. Now we have set up 150 cultural and technical schools in our commune, with 4,000 people participating in the study, and the cultural and technical level of the farmers has been significantly improved. In addition, cultural and recreational activities are often carried out, such as theater performances, ball games, and so on.

    Due to the implementation of mechanized cultivation, the cultivation in areas with less people and more land is timely, and the processing and management are more refined, and the output is greatly increased. The income of the members has also increased greatly. In this year's summer distribution, in addition to the implementation of the grain and grass supply system, the more than 8,000 households in the entire commune received an average of 60 yuan, which is double that of last year's summer distribution. The members have added a lot of daily necessities, furniture, and clothing.

    The members have seen the bright future from the commune's addition of agricultural machinery, and everyone is determined to go all out, vigorously engage in the movement to increase production and practice economy, do a better job in production, accumulate more funds, and prepare to add and purchase five threshers, ten tractors, five seeders, five winnowers, twenty automatic sprayers, and two combine harvesters in the autumn of 1959 or 1960.

    If the state can supply machines according to the commune's plan, the entire commune can realize agricultural mechanization by 1961.

    公社给实现机械化创造了条件
    江苏省江宁县长江人民公社党委书记　周友和
    党的八届八中全会向全国人民发出号召，要求提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标和提前实现农业发展纲要四十条。我们长江人民公社的全体干部和社员，坚决以实际行动来热烈响应党的号召。
    我是一个农村干部，自从去年大跃进以来，我体会最深的是人民公社所显示出来的巨大优越性。拿我们长江人民公社来说吧，它在短短的一年里所显示出来的强大的生命力和无比的优越性，真是三天三夜也说不完。今年夏季三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）大丰收，是我们这里开洲二十年来的特大丰收。全公社四万三千八百余亩三麦，亩产量与总产量都比去年增加61.3％，更比解放前亩产量增加354.7％。一提起这个大丰收，社员们就歌唱道：“公社一枝花，花开麦穗大，活了六十九，没见这庄稼。若是问根由，全靠共产党，人民公社好，机器威力大。”的确，三麦大丰收，除了因为执行八字宪法，兴修农田水利，深翻密植外，在我们长江公社来说，农业机械的使用和效能的充分发挥，是一个重要的原因。
    我们这个方圆五十里的洲地，在长江边上，是二十年前从安徽、河南、山东等省逃荒来的灾民所开辟出来的一片荒洲柴滩。过去这里一直是土地多，畜力、劳力少，每个劳力要负担十五亩土地，耕作往往不能适时，影响了大面积的增产。1955年，国家在这里设立了一个马拉农具站，有三台拖拉机帮农民代耕。1956年高级合作化以后，根据依靠群众实现农业机械化的方针，国家又把六部拖拉机和其他机器交给当时拥有二万四千六百四十二亩土地、二千二百一十二户社员的长江农业社经营。本社、外社的社员们看到这些“铁牛”一耕一大片，又深又快，心里着实喜欢。他们想：要是生产都使用这玩意，那该多好！他们看到了农业机械化的美好远景，宁愿省吃俭用，多积累，争取早日实现机械化。但是在当时，由于社小力薄，不能大量积累和添购农业机械。如焦州农业社一年总收入只有四千五百块钱，半个拖拉机也买不起。即使现有的几部机器，也由于农村没有修配厂，一出了毛病，还必须运到附近的常州或南京去修理，成本高，也耽误时间，不能充分发挥机械潜在能力。社员反映：“拖拉机好是好，可是坏了就没办法。”
    1958年大跃进和公社化后，这些困难一扫而光。原来十六个高级社组成了一个统一的整体，真是规模大，人力足，积累多，资金厚。1958年秋，我们集中各生产队积累的公共资金四十多万元，添购了一部拖拉机、两部收割机、一部大型脱粒机、二部六十马力的抽水机、八台小型抽水机。加上原来的各种机械，现在全公社已拥有八部拖拉机，九部播种机，元盘耙、丁齿耙五张，收割机二台，大型脱粒机一台，抽水机五十四部，拖车四辆。
    这些农业机械在公社的统一调配下，充分发挥了威力。过去，有的高级社有拖拉机、抽水机，有的没有，因为高级社各自经营，不能统一调度使用。没有拖拉机的虽然劳畜力不足，也只能依靠本社力量慢慢解决，以致影响了生产。例如滨江大队有四千亩麦田，公社化前，每年由于畜力不足，以人力拉犁，季节抓不住，三麦单产只一百二十斤。公社化后，滨江大队使用五部拖拉机耕地，仅三昼夜的时间，就耕完了二千多亩。全公社一万五千亩三麦田，由于实行了机耕，余下的一万八千多亩也大多是用双轮双铧犁耕作，比1957年秋种提早了二十天。公社化后，我们认为自己有条件办一个机械修配厂了，便着手培养了八十多名驾驶和修理拖拉机的技术人才，又搜集了各大队有关机械方面的原材料、零件、人力、物力，开办了一个机械修配厂。这个厂购置了一个五十瓩的发电机，带动了三个车间的六部车床，做到了机器随坏随修。这一来，拖拉机手的干劲也更加足了。秋种时，全公社社员在公社化的高潮鼓舞下，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的深翻运动。当时，虽然有三千五百多人外调支援钢铁战线，但大家夜以继日地抢耕抢种，八部拖拉机分班操作，人停机不停，充分发挥了机械潜在能力，每部拖拉机耕作效率比以前提高了一倍，一昼夜耕地二百亩，而且也达到了深翻的要求。全公社一万五千余亩三麦地，统统深翻八寸以上。
    全公社有一半以上的地实行机耕，劳力紧张状态大大地缓和了，腾出了九十四万七千五百个劳动日来加强积肥工作和田间管理。1958年积肥量比1953年超过了十八倍，三麦每亩平均上肥一百六十担，比过去增加35％，追肥三次到四次。除草、治虫、壅土的工作也做得更细致了。
    麦收的时候，由于有脱粒机，速度快，一部脱粒机一天可脱粒六万斤麦子。今年夏收中，用机器脱粒的就有一百五十万斤。过去运麦子、卖粮都是人挑、车推，很吃力，速度又慢。公社化后，自办的机械修配厂利用旧料改装了三部机动拖车和一只机帆船，这就节约了运输劳力三十万个。
    过去，每逢大雨，都是用人力排水，麦田内涝问题还不能根本解决。公社化后，除了排灌系统经过全面整修外，还集体添置了五十四部抽水机，保证沟沟塘塘降低水位三尺，麦田地下水位也平均比1957年同期降低八寸到一尺，连下一百毫米的大雨也不至内涝，保障了三麦的正常生长。
    在今年特大的旱灾威胁下，我们更充分发挥了公社和机器的巨大威力，使全公社80％的稻田、旱地得到了机器灌溉，庄稼生长特别旺盛、茁壮，又一个丰收已经在望。
    一年来的事实雄辩地说明了，人民公社在充分发挥农业机械效能方面，比农业社优越得多。实行机械耕作后，一部分劳动强度很大的农活，已经由机器代替了。每年栽秧之后，在炎热的太阳下用人力踏水，时间至少有三个月；现在用抽水机代替人力踏水了。尤其是妇女不大担负重活了，只是做些比较轻微的锄草、追肥、治虫等农活。每年春秋大忙时，花劳力最多的是耕地。以往这种农活，大多是用九个到十二个劳力拉犁，但一天只能耕八分地；现在全部用机器和双铧犁来代替人拉犁了。
    由于劳动强度减轻，社员们到晚上就可以参加文化、技术学校。现在我们公社已办了一百五十个文化技术学校，有四千人参加学习，农民的文化、技术水平有显著的提高。另外，还经常开展文娱活动，剧团演戏，球类比赛，等等。
    由于实行了机械耕作，使人少地多的地区耕作及时，而且加工管理也比较精细，产量大大提高。社员的收入也大大增加，今年夏季分配，除了实行粮草供给制以外，全社八千多户人家平均分到六十元，与去年夏季分配相比，增加了一倍。社员添置了很多日用品、家具和服装等。
    社员们从公社添置农业机械上看到了光明的前途，大家决心鼓足干劲，大搞增产节约运动，把生产搞得更好，积累更多的资金，准备在1959年秋或1960年添置和购买脱粒机五台、拖拉机十台、播种机五台、扬场机五台、自动喷雾器二十台、联合收割机二台。
    如果国家能按公社规划供应机器，到1961年，全社就可以实现农业机械化了。
