    (Reported by this newspaper) The communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on launching the movement to increase production and practice economy have become a powerful driving force for the continued leap forward of the Huazhou Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi. A super-production movement to irrigate corn with “bumper harvest water” and apply “super-yield fertilizer” is being pushed to a new peak. In recent days, more than 35,000 laborers from the entire commune have been fighting day and night in the fields. From August 27th to 31st, within five days after the announcement of the communique and the resolution, they had already irrigated more than 30,000 mu of corn four times with “bumper harvest water.” Cumulatively, more than 50,000 mu of corn have been irrigated four times, and more than 17,000 mu of corn have also been applied with the third application of “super-yield fertilizer.” Now, with the determination and drive to increase grain yield by one dou per mu, all commune members are proposing a friendly super-production competition to fraternal communes in Shaanxi Province that have irrigation facilities.
    The heroic members of the Huazhou Commune have been fighting the drought for more than fifty days. In the struggle against drought, they found that more than 6,000 mu of corn, although all irrigated and fertilized and cultivated meticulously, grew very differently. Some started to turn from yellow to green; some grew well in the morning and evening but curled their leaves at noon; some had thick stalks and strong leaves, showing no signs of drought; some had large ears and many kernels, promising a good harvest. In order to further study drought resistance measures, Niu Zhiming, secretary of the commune party committee, consulted experienced old farmers, who explained that the different growing conditions were caused by the varying number of irrigations. The old farmers unanimously believed that under the continuing drought conditions, one irrigation only had a “life-saving” effect; two irrigations had a “缓性 (slow-acting)” effect; three irrigations ensured production; and four irrigations could guarantee a bumper harvest. Later, yield measurements proved that the old farmers' opinions were completely correct. If corn irrigated once was not irrigated again, it would reduce production by about half compared to the planned targets; corn irrigated twice would reduce production by 30%; corn irrigated three times could complete the original production increase plan targets; and corn irrigated four times could increase production by 30 to 50 jin per mu. From the comparison, everyone felt that this was a very important issue in the current drought resistance and autumn harvest. They calculated that if all 64,000 mu of corn in the commune were irrigated four times with “bumper harvest water,” each mu would yield an extra 30 jin of grain, resulting in an increase of 1.92 million jin of grain; if all 90,000 mu of cotton were irrigated once with “bumper harvest water,” each mu would produce an extra 10 jin of ginned cotton, resulting in an increase of 900,000 jin of ginned cotton. At the commune party committee meeting, it was unanimously decided to launch a production increase movement of universally irrigating four times with “bumper harvest water.”
    On August 25th, the commune held an on-site meeting in the Dongzhao Management District for 150 people, including party committee secretaries and production team leaders from various management districts. Through visits, discussions, and exchanges, the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres was eliminated. Many people also cited similar facts to illustrate the significant role of irrigating with “bumper harvest water.” At the on-site meeting, many comrades also proposed that after irrigating four times with “bumper harvest water,” measures such as applying more “production increase fertilizer” and meticulous cultivation should closely follow. Through the on-site meeting, the cadres' ideological understanding was further improved. After returning, they immediately organized the commune members to work hard while the iron was hot.
    After the communique and resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the commune party committee immediately organized the commune members to study them. The commune members all said that the communique and resolution were a guiding light with boundless brilliance. The commune members' enthusiasm for "irrigating bumper harvest water" and applying "super-yield fertilizer" became even greater. Almost every household in the commune locked its doors, and everyone went to the fields. Everywhere was full of people during the day and lights at night. When the canal water ran out, they used well water; when the well water dried up, they dug for seepage, even leading long-unused accumulated water into the fields. The Lijiapu Production Team of the Houfang Management District dug a one-mu pit in a low-lying area to concentrate the seepage, and then used buckets, scoops, and windlasses to lift it up. On August 28th alone, they irrigated 37 mu of autumn fields. The Guapo Management District also classified all the autumn fields, set deadlines for irrigating the "bumper harvest water" and applying the "super-yield fertilizer."

### 普浇丰收水  多施超产肥  华州公社决心战胜干旱每亩多收一斗粮

    普浇丰收水  多施超产肥
    华州公社决心战胜干旱每亩多收一斗粮
    本报讯　党的八届八中全会公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议，成了推动陕西渭南县华州公社继续跃进的强大动力。一个给玉米浇“丰收水”、施“超产肥”的超产运动，正在推向更高峰。连日来，全社三万五千多名劳动大军，日夜战斗在田间，由8月27日至31日，即公报和决议公布后的五天内，他们已给三万多亩玉米浇过了四次
  “丰收水”。连前累计，浇过四次水的玉米已有五万多亩，其中一万七千多亩玉米还施了第三次“超产肥”。现在，全体社员以每亩多收一斗粮的决心和干劲，向陕西省有灌溉设施的兄弟公社，倡议开展友谊超产竞赛运动。
    英雄的华州公社社员，已经与干旱搏斗了五十多天。在抗旱斗争当中，他们发现有六千多亩玉米虽然全部浇了水，施了肥，作务都很精细，但生长情况却很不一样。有的开始由黄变绿；有的早晚生长良好，中午卷叶；有的秆粗叶壮，根本无旱象；有的穗大粒多丰收有望。为了进一步研究抗旱措施，公社党委书记牛之明请教了老农，才知道是因为浇水次数多少不一造成的。老农们一致认为，在旱象继续发展的情况下，浇一水的只起了“救命”的作用；浇二水的起了“缓性”作用；浇三水的保了产；浇四水的可保证丰收。后来经过测产，也证明老农的意见完全正确。浇一水的如不再浇水，比计划指标将减产一半左右；浇二水的，将减产30％；浇三水的可完成原订增产计划指标；浇四水的，每亩可增产三十斤到五十斤。从对比中，大家感到这是当前抗旱保秋中一个十分重要的问题。他们算了一下：全社六万四千多亩玉米都浇四次“丰收水”，每亩多收三十斤粮，就要多收一百九十二万斤粮食；全社九万多亩棉花，浇一次“丰收水”，每亩再超产十斤皮棉，就要多收九十万斤皮棉。在公社党委会议上，一致通过开展一次普浇四次“丰收水”的增产运动。
    8月25日，公社在东赵管区召开了各管区党委书记、生产队长等一百五十人的现场会议，通过参观访问、座谈，消除了部分干部的各种右倾保守思想，很多人也举出同样事实来说明浇“丰收水”的重大作用。在现场会议上，许多同志还提出在浇过四次“丰收水”以后，多施“增产肥”和精细作务等措施要紧紧地跟上去。通过现场会，干部的思想认识更加提高了，他们回去后，趁热打铁，立即组织社员大干起来。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，公社党委又马上组织社员学习。社员们都说，公报和决议是一盏光芒万丈的指路明灯。社员们“浇丰收水”施“超产肥”的干劲越来越大了。全公社几乎是家家锁门，人人下地，白天各处是人，晚上到处是灯。渠水完了车井水，井水干了挖渗流，把多年无用的积水也引入田里。候方管理区李家堡生产队在一个低洼地区挖了一亩大一个坑，使渗水集中，然后用桶担、戽斗、辘轳等工具提上去，8月28日一天就浇秋田三十七亩。瓜坡管理区还把所有秋田进行分类排队，限期浇完了“丰收水”，施完了“超产肥”。
