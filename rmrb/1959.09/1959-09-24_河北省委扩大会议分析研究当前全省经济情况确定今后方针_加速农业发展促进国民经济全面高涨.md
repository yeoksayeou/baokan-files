The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its First Eighth Plenary Session (Enlarged) from August 24th to September 16th to convey and implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. After more than twenty days of study and discussion, it examined and criticized right-leaning thinking in its work and the right-leaning opportunist errors of some cadres, and used a large number of rich facts to prove that the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, communization, and the Great Steel Smelting campaign in 1958 were extremely great. They unanimously expressed their determination to seize new victories in the continued leap forward in 1959 on the basis of last year's great victory.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the great achievements made in the province since 1958 vividly and eloquently prove that the Party's General Line is completely correct. Under the inspiration of the General Line, in 1958, workers, farmers, and revolutionary intellectuals throughout the province eliminated superstitions, liberated their minds, and their communist consciousness soared to unprecedented heights, creating countless miracles and winning an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. Within one year, the total industrial output value increased by 59.63%, exceeding the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan by 2.7 times; the total agricultural output value increased by 24.37%, exceeding the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan by more than 15.5 times. New victories in the continued leap forward were also achieved in the first eight months of this year. From January to August, the total industrial output value increased by 55% compared with the same period last year. The output of various major products, such as iron, increased by more than four times, coal increased by 58%, and machinery increased by 69%. Other heavy and light industrial products have also greatly increased their production, and the quality of products has also improved significantly. Especially on the steel front, the equipment of small blast furnaces has been improved, and the technical level of workers' operations has been improved. In agriculture, a summer harvest has been obtained, and a bumper autumn harvest is in sight throughout the province. Although a few areas have suffered from varying degrees of waterlogging, wind, hail, and other disasters, the superiority of the people's communes has been brought into play, and the vast number of commune members have carried out a tenacious struggle against natural disasters. In particular, thanks to the various water conservancy projects in the past few years and the completion of the five major reservoirs of Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Wangkuai, Xidayang, and Hengshanling, as well as the flood control project of the Miyun Reservoir this year, the Hutuo River, Zhurong River, Tang River, and Chaobai River have been basically brought under control, so that the extraordinary floods this year have not turned into widespread disasters. The continued development of these projects will fundamentally change the natural landscape of the province and lay an extremely favorable foundation for the great development of agriculture in the future.

Since the spirit of the central government's instructions on opposing right-leaning, boosting morale, and launching an increase production and practice economy campaign was conveyed and implemented, a new upsurge in the increase production and practice economy campaign has quickly emerged on various economic fronts throughout the province, and the results have been extremely significant. In industry, the output of steel and coal has risen sharply. In early September, the daily output of coal reached 125,500 tons, and the daily output of iron reached 6,405 tons; the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and the quality of pig iron both exceeded the past highest levels. The overproduction competition campaign in agriculture is developing in depth, and the early autumn crops are being harvested tensely. The actual harvest situation in various places shows that overproduction by 10% to 20% is entirely possible. The increase production and practice economy campaigns on other fronts such as transportation and commerce are also being carried out enthusiastically.

The meeting, based on the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's resolution on launching an increase production and practice economy campaign and the adjusted 1959 economic indicators, revised the Hebei Province's increase production and practice economy tasks. The revised major indicators of industrial production such as steel, iron, and coal all exceeded the tasks assigned by the state. Steel increased by 28% compared with last year, iron increased by 224.9% compared with last year, and coal increased by 38.5% compared with last year. All of these are plans for the Great Leap Forward. The revised agricultural production indicators such as grain and cotton all increased by more than 10% compared with last year, which is still a plan for continued leap forward. The meeting required all party members and the people of the province to strive by all means to complete this plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it in the new upsurge of the enthusiastic increase production and practice economy campaign in the fourth quarter. This winter and next spring, we must start with production and firmly grasp the completion of the rectification of communes. All people's communes must do a good job in the autumn harvest distribution and the three fixings of grain, mobilize the masses to formulate next year's production plan. At the same time, we must actively run collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly.

The Hebei Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting specifically analyzed and studied the current provincial economic situation, believing that in the case that the province's industry has already made major developments, it should further increase the speed of agricultural development to promote an overall upsurge in the national economy. Since the Great Leap Forward in Hebei Province in 1958, industrial and agricultural production has continued to leap forward. In 1958, the total industrial output value increased by more than 59% compared with 1957, and it is expected to increase by 35.3% compared with 1958 in 1959. Agricultural production has greatly increased in major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil crops in the past two years. Tangshan, Shijiazhuang and other medium-sized cities and economic crop areas that mainly relied on the central government for transfer and supply have basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain through provincial balance and transfer, greatly reducing the burden on the state. At present, the total industrial output value of the province has reached 72% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. In the total industrial output value, the output value of means of production (i.e., heavy industry) accounts for 54%, and the output value of means of livelihood accounts for 46%. This situation shows that Hebei Province's industrial production has already occupied a dominant position in the national economy, laying a considerable material foundation for the technical transformation of agriculture and the entire national economy. However, the development of agriculture, especially the output of grain, is not compatible with the development of industry. It is necessary to further increase the speed of agricultural development, continue to work hard for three to five years, and make the greatest determination to completely change the face of agriculture. The meeting clearly pointed out that this is by no means to slow down the development speed of heavy industry, but to better implement the central government's policy, and to achieve a reasonable ratio between the production of means of production and the production of means of livelihood. In general, it is precisely to more forcefully guarantee the accelerated development of industry.

The meeting also proposed that the fundamental way to develop agricultural production at high speed is to vigorously carry out agricultural capital construction and rapidly improve the level of agricultural mechanization, so as to fundamentally change agricultural production conditions. Therefore, first, it is necessary to vigorously carry out water conservancy construction to overcome drought and flood disasters. The main thing is to extensively tap underground and above-ground water sources, continue to sink machine wells, repair channels, and expand the irrigated area of farmland, and strive to realize water conservancy in all areas with water source conditions within three years. In addition, it is necessary to vigorously develop drainage and irrigation machinery, and basically realize the mechanization of drainage and irrigation throughout the province by 1962; continue to build reservoirs in a planned way to control the Hai River. In addition to continuing to complete the six major reservoir projects, more than ten large reservoirs, more than one hundred medium-sized reservoirs, and more than four thousand small reservoirs will be built by 1962. Coupled with other soil and water conservation projects, floods will be basically controlled, turning water hazards into water conservancy; it is also necessary to universally build field drainage projects, and vigorously build terrace fields and ridge fields in low-lying areas, so that all farmland can be irrigated and drained, and there is no waterlogging. Strive to make 100 million mu of land in the province achieve guaranteed harvest regardless of drought or flood by 1962. Second, it is necessary to greatly increase the application of farm manure and chemical fertilizers, and gradually increase the quantity and quality of fertilizers. Farm manure mainly focuses on vigorously developing pig raising and manure accumulation, requiring 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu within three years. At the same time, rapidly increase chemical fertilizer production and gradually establish chemical fertilizer plants. The production of local chemical fertilizers should be vigorously developed after being identified as effective, and the quality should be actively improved. In addition, it is also necessary to expand the existing pesticide factories and biopharmaceutical factories, and actively increase the manufacturing and supply of pesticides and antibiotics. Third, agricultural mechanization should be gradually realized. It is required to solve it in four years and greatly solve it in seven years. Before 1962, in addition to actively carrying out mass tool reforms to realize semi-mechanization, the number of tractors should be greatly increased to expand the cultivated area. As far as possible, improve the degree of mechanization of operations such as plowing, pest control, and threshing. It is also necessary to improve the degree of mechanization of reservoir construction; gradually improve transportation conditions, reform transportation tools, gradually realize rubber tires and develop light railways; and vigorously develop motorized sailing ships in fisheries, focusing on the development of fishing vessels. With the development of agricultural mechanization, a complete agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair system will be gradually established throughout the province. Fourth, animal husbandry should be vigorously developed. People's communes and production teams in various places should actively protect and breed draught animals in the spirit of combining breeding and protection and self-selection, self-matching, and every team having them. With the gradual increase in the degree of agricultural mechanization, we must not ignore the role of livestock, and we must implement the policy of walking on two legs, livestock and machinery. In addition, further implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, vigorously carry out deep plowing, improve soil, implement gardening farming methods, implement intensive cultivation, and strive to realize gardening cultivation on more than half of the cultivated land in the province within three years. In order to ensure the high-speed development of agricultural production, it is also necessary to strengthen the comprehensive support of industry to agriculture.

Finally, the meeting pointed out that the right-leaning thinking that currently exists inside and outside the Party must be resolutely criticized and overcome. Although the right-leaning thinking among some cadres has been reversed since the launch of the anti-right-leaning campaign in early August, the harm it causes must not be underestimated. Resolutely implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and resolutely overcoming all right-leaning thinking and thoroughly crushing the right-leaning opportunist attack is a serious political task for the entire Party at present. It is required that all party members and cadres thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the resolutions of this meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, and thoroughly examine and criticize various right-leaning thinking in combination with studying documents. Cadres of party and state organs, mass organizations, and troops at all levels can adopt the method of concentrating on studying and examining for a period of time, and then shifting to regular methods for in-depth progress; among party members and cadres at the grassroots level in rural areas, studying the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee is regarded as the central task of political and ideological education in the fourth quarter. Among the broad masses, universal education on the General Line, boosting morale, and increasing production and practicing economy should be carried out. Party committees at all levels should fully utilize the experience of vigorously launching mass movements in 1958, continue to adhere to the policy of putting politics in command and boldly mobilizing the masses, further deepen the propaganda and education of the General Line into the hearts of the people, inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring energy of the masses, vigorously launch socialist labor competitions, and set off a new upsurge of competing for red flags, establishing pacesetters, comparing with advanced, learning from advanced, and catching up with advanced, and strive to complete and overfulfill various production and construction plans ahead of schedule in an all-round way to achieve a double leap forward in politics and economy.

    河北省委扩大会议分析研究当前全省经济情况确定今后方针
    加速农业发展促进国民经济全面高涨
    本报讯　中共河北省委从8月24日到9月16日召开了第一届第八次全会扩大会议，传达和贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议。经过二十多天的学习和讨论，检查批判了工作中的右倾思想和某些干部的右倾机会主义错误，以大量丰富的事实，证明1958年大跃进、公社化和大炼钢铁的成就是极其伟大的，一致表示要决心在去年伟大胜利的基础上，夺取1959年继续跃进的新胜利。
    会议一致认为：全省从1958年以来所取得的伟大成就，生动地和雄辩地证明了党的总路线是完全正确的。在总路线的鼓舞下，1958年全省工人、农民和革命知识分子，破除了迷信，解放了思想，共产主义觉悟空前高涨，创造了不可胜数的奇迹，夺得了史无前例的大跃进。一年之内，工业总产值增长59.63％，超过第一个五年计划期间的平均增长速度二点七倍；农业总产值增长了24.37％，超过第一个五年计划期间的平均增长速度十五倍半以上。今年前八个月又获得了继续跃进的新胜利。1至8月份工业总产值比去年同期增长了55％，各种主要产品如：铁增长四倍多，煤增长58％，机械增长69％。其他各种重工业和轻工业产品都有很大的增产，产品质量也有显著提高。特别在钢铁战线上，小高炉设备改善了，工人操作技术水平提高了。农业方面已获得了夏季丰收，全省秋季丰收局势已经形成，虽然少数地区遭受到不同程度的水涝风雹等灾害，但由于发挥了人民公社的优越性，广大社员向自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，特别是由于过去几年来各项水利建设和今年岗南、黄壁庄、王快、西大洋、横山岭五大水库以及密云水库拦洪工程的完成，基本上根治了滹沱河、潴龙河、唐河、潮白河，使今年的特大洪水没有泛滥成灾。这些工程的继续大发展，将使全省自然面貌发生根本性的变化，对今后农业大发展将打下极为有利的基础。
    自从传达贯彻了中央关于反右倾、鼓干劲、开展增产节约运动的指示精神后，全省各个经济战线上很快就出现了一个增产节约运动的新高潮，成绩极为显著。工业方面，钢铁和煤炭的产量急剧上升。9月上旬煤的日产量曾达到十二万五千五百吨，铁的日产量曾达到六千四百零五吨；高炉利用系数和生铁质量都超过了过去的最高水平。农业方面的超产竞赛运动正深入发展，正紧张地进行早秋作物的收割，各地实际收获的情况都表明，超产一、二成是完全可能的。其他交通运输、商业等战线上的增产节约运动，也都火热地开展着。
    会议根据党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议和调整后的1959年各项经济指标，重新修订了河北省的增产节约任务。修订后的钢、铁、煤炭等工业生产的主要指标，都超过了国家分配的任务，钢比去年增长28％，铁比去年增长224.9％，煤比去年增长38.5％，都是大跃进的计划；修订后的粮、棉等农业生产指标，都比去年增长10％以上，仍是继续跃进的计划。会议要求全体党员和全省人民，在第四季度热火朝天的增产节约运动新高潮中，千方百计地为提前和超额完成这个计划指标而奋斗。今冬明春要从生产入手，紧抓完成整社工作。所有人民公社都要作好秋收分配和粮食三定工作，发动群众制定好明年生产计划。同时，要积极办好食堂、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业。
    河北省委全会扩大会议，具体分析和研究了当前全省经济情况，认为在全省工业已经有了重大发展的情况下，应该进一步提高农业发展的速度，以促进国民经济的全面高涨。河北省从1958年大跃进以来，工农业生产连续跃进，1958年工业总产值较1957年增长59％以上，1959年预计又要比1958年增长35.3％；农业生产，两年来在粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品方面，都有很大增长。过去主要依靠中央调剂供应的唐山、石家庄等中等城市和经济作物区，经过全省平衡调剂，基本上实现了粮食自给，大大减轻了国家负担。目前，全省工业生产总值已达到工农业总产值的72％，在工业总产值中，生产资料（即重工业）产值占54％，生活资料产值占46％。这一情况表明，河北省工业生产已经在国民经济中占着主导地位，为农业以及整个国民经济的技术改造打下了相当大的物质基础。但是农业的发展特别是粮食的产量，对于工业的发展是不相适应的。必须更进一步提高农业的发展速度，继续苦战三、五年，下最大决心彻底改变农业面貌。会议明确指出：这样作，决不是说要把重工业的发展速度放慢，而是为了更好地执行中央的方针，为了使生产资料的生产同生活资料的生产达到合理的比例。从总的来说，正是为了更有力地保证工业的加速发展。
    会议并且提出：高速度发展农业生产的根本办法是，大搞农业基本建设，迅速提高农业机械化水平，从根本上改变农业生产条件。因此，第一，要大搞水利建设，克服旱涝灾害。主要是广泛挖掘地下地上水源，继续打机井、修渠道、扩大农田灌溉面积，争取三年内凡一切有水源条件的地区，都要实现水利化。此外，要大力发展排灌机械，1962年全省基本实现排灌机械化；有计划地继续兴建水库，根治海河，除继续完成六大水库工程外，到1962年再修建十多座大型水库和百多座中型水库、四千多座小型水库，加上其他水土保持工程，把洪水基本上控制起来，变水害为水利；还要普遍兴修田间排涝工程，低洼地区大力修筑台田、畦田，全部农田作到能灌能排，不积沥水，争取1962年全省一亿亩土地作到旱涝保丰收。第二，要大量增施农家肥料和化学肥料，逐年提高肥料的数量和质量。农家肥料主要是大力发展养猪积肥，要求三年内作到亩施万斤肥，同时迅速增加化肥生产，逐步建立化肥厂。对土化肥生产，经过鉴定有效的应大力发展，积极提高质量。另外还要扩建现有的农药厂和生物药厂，积极增加农药和抗生素的制造和供应。第三，要逐步实现农业机械化。要求四年中解决，七年大解决。1962年以前除积极开展群众性的工具改革，实现半机械化以外，大力增加拖拉机台数，扩大耕地面积。尽可能地提高耕种、除虫、脱粒等操作机械化程度。还要提高水库建设施工机械化程度；逐渐改进交通运输条件，改革运输工具，逐步实现胶轮化和发展轻便铁路；渔业上大力发展机帆船，有重点地发展渔轮。随着农业机械化的发展，全省逐步建立起完整的农业机械制造和修配系统。第四，要大力发展畜牧业。各地人民公社和生产队，都应本着繁殖和保护并举的方针和自选、自配、队队有的精神，积极保护和繁殖耕畜。在农业机械化程度逐步增加的情况下，决不能对牲畜的作用有所忽视，必须贯彻执行牲畜、机械两条腿走路的方针。此外，进一步贯彻农业“八字宪法”，大搞深翻土地、改良土壤、实行园田化的耕作方法，实行精耕细作，力争三年内全省有半数以上的耕地实现耕作园田化。为了保证农业生产高速度发展，还必须加强工业对农业的全面支援。
    最后，会议指出：当前在党内党外存在的一种右倾思想必须坚决批判和克服。虽然从8月初开展反右倾以来，在部分干部中的右倾思想已有所扭转，但决不能低估其危害性。坚决贯彻执行八届八中全会的精神，坚决克服一切右倾思想，彻底粉碎右倾机会主义进攻，是全党当前严重的政治任务。要求全体党员、干部，深入贯彻执行八届八中全会的决议和省委这次会议的决议，结合学习文件，彻底检查和批判各种各样的右倾思想。各级党和国家机关、群众团体、部队的干部，可采取集中一段时间进行学习和检查，而后转入经常的办法深入进行；在农村基层党员、干部中，把学习八届八中全会决议，作为第四季度政治思想教育工作的中心任务。在广大群众中，普遍进行总路线、鼓干劲、增产节约的教育。各级党委要充分利用1958年大搞群众运动的经验，继续坚持政治挂帅、放手发动群众的方针，进一步把总路线的宣传教育深入人心，鼓舞群众的革命热情和冲天干劲，大搞社会主义劳动竞赛，再掀起一个争红旗、树标兵、比先进、学先进、赶先进的新高潮，力争提前全面完成和超额完成各项生产建设计划，达到政治经济双跃进。
