Chengdu, September 11th (from this newspaper) The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee recently issued instructions on implementing the "Resolution on Unfolding a Campaign to Increase Production and Practice Economy" of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, calling on Party and government organizations at all levels in the province and the people of the province to urgently mobilize, respond to the call of the Party, and resolutely and rapidly push the increase production and practice economy campaign to a new peak throughout the province, and strive to realize the great task of fulfilling the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year.

Last year, Sichuan Province's industrial and agricultural production achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. The total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 37.6% compared with 1957, of which steel increased by 75.4% (excluding native steel); grain increased by 39.7%; and cotton increased by 28.6%. In the past seven months of this year, Sichuan Province's industrial and agricultural production has achieved new and great victories on the basis of last year's unprecedented Great Leap Forward. From January to July this year, compared with the same period last year: the province's total industrial output value increased by 78.2%, steel increased by 73.9%, pig iron increased by 3.9 times, raw coal increased by 2.4 times, sulfuric acid increased by 49%, cotton yarn increased by 26.6%, and the production of various other industrial products also increased significantly. Not only has the quantity of various industrial products increased significantly, but the quality has also been continuously improved and enhanced. The workload of capital construction increased by 88.3%. The freight volume of various transportation tools increased by 90%. Last year's Great Leap Forward and the new achievements in industrial and agricultural production and construction in the past seven months have brought about extremely profound changes in several aspects of the province's economic front. For example, in the past, most of the pig iron used for steelmaking in the province's key steel plants was supplied by other provinces, but now more than 90% is supplied by this province; many equipment that could not be manufactured independently in the past can now be self-made; and the proportion of products from this province in the light industrial products supplied to the market has greatly increased.

In agriculture, due to the realization of people's communes, the spring harvest of 1959 has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with the total grain output increasing by 30%, which is even greater than the increase in the particularly good harvest of 1958. Although the summer harvest suffered from a severe drought unseen in decades, and some areas suffered from severe floods, waterlogging, wind, pests and other disasters after the drought, under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of cadres and peasants, with the heroic spirit of "man will conquer nature," launched a vigorous anti-drought and disaster relief struggle, and timely carried out additional planting, replanting, and change of planting, which greatly reduced the losses caused by the drought and ensured continued production increases. In commerce, due to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the total purchase amount from January to July this year increased by 48% compared with the same period last year, and the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 38%. The sales volume of the vast majority of major commodities has increased significantly compared with the same period last year.

The instructions stated that according to the state's unified plan and the verification of the province's grain and cotton output statistics by the statistical department, and taking into account the implementation of the national economic plan in the past seven months and the severe drought encountered in agricultural production, it is necessary to make necessary adjustments to the 1959 national economic plan: the steel output is set at one million tons (excluding native steel), an increase of 61% compared with last year; the raw coal output is set at 33 million tons, an increase of 62.7% compared with last year; the grain output will increase by about 10% compared with the finally verified output of 65 billion jin last year; and the cotton output will increase by about 20% compared with the finally verified output of 1.8 million dan last year. Obviously, the adjusted targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton are still Great Leap Forward targets, and they are also targets that can further encourage and enhance the enthusiasm of the broad masses.

In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's national economic plan, the instructions require that industry, agriculture, and transportation should universally and deeply carry out socialist labor emulation drives and strive to increase production. The primary task of agricultural production at present is to carry out the anti-drought and disaster relief struggle to the end, continue to complete the task of additional planting, and strengthen the management of summer crops and additional crops to ensure multiple planting and multiple harvests. The autumn harvest is the final battle to seize agricultural production increases, and we must concentrate our efforts to ensure good harvesting, good threshing, good sales, good distribution, and good storage. Areas severely affected by disasters must ensure production, areas slightly affected by disasters must increase production, and areas basically free from disasters must greatly increase production. We must fully prepare for the spring harvest production and complete the sowing tasks in a timely manner; conscientiously implement the policy of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with less planting and multiple harvesting, actively expand the planting area of spring crops, and increase the yield per unit area. Vigorously develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, greatly increase commodity production, increase market supply, and increase commune income. All industrial production must adhere to the general requirements of high output, high quality, high work efficiency, low cost, and safe production. First of all, we must make the greatest efforts to increase the production of steel, iron, and coking coal. Transportation must resolutely implement the policy of ensuring industry, agriculture, and commerce with transportation, and strive to complete this year's transportation plan ahead of schedule and over fulfill it. Commercial work must cooperate with industrial and agricultural production increases and firmly grasp the completion of the purchasing and sales plans, and no neglect is allowed.

The instructions pointed out that increasing production must be accompanied by thrift and economy. We must carry out education on diligence and thrift in a big way and in depth among all cadres and all people, so that the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, running people's communes diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily will be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Rural people's communes must pay attention to vigorously saving grain and arranging the lives of commune members. All industrial and transportation departments and all factories and mining enterprises should formulate savings plans according to the average advanced quotas, and vigorously save various raw materials, materials, power, transportation capacity, and labor force under the premise of ensuring quality. All organs, troops, groups, enterprises, and institutions should resolutely save all expenses that can be saved. The instructions emphasized that we must continue to adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, seriously criticize and thoroughly overcome right-leaning thinking, further strengthen revolutionary will, and ensure the strong leadership of the Party in all communes, all factories, mines, enterprises, and other departments. Continue to boldly mobilize the masses, mobilize all positive factors, and rapidly push the increase production and practice economy campaign to a new peak.

The instructions finally called on leading cadres at all levels to show the same enthusiasm as they did in developing steel and iron in a big way last year and in launching the "Four Autumns" campaign, closely connect with the masses, rely on the masses, adopt a fighting style of seizing every minute and second, use effective experience, use advanced methods to drive the intermediate and improve backward working methods, and handle various problems in production in a timely, decisive, and accurate manner. Especially at the critical moment of industrial and agricultural production, leading cadres should personally take charge, go deep into the forefront of production, share weal and woe with the masses, overcome difficulties with the masses, and complete tasks more successfully.

    四川省委和省人委发出关于贯彻八中全会决议的指示
    掀起增产节约运动新高潮
    本报成都11日电　中共四川省委和四川省人民委员会最近发出关于贯彻执行党的八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的决议的指示，号召全省各级党政组织和全省人民紧急动员起来，响应党的号召，坚决、迅速地在全省范围内把增产节约运动推向新的高峰，为实现全省在今年内提前完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大任务而奋斗。
    去年四川省工农业生产获得空前大跃进，工农业总产值比1957年增长37.6％，其中钢增长75.4％（不包括土钢）；粮食增长39.7％；棉花增长28.6％。今年七个多月以来，四川省的工农业生产在去年空前大跃进的基础上，又取得了新的伟大胜利。今年1至7月份与去年同期比较：全省工业总产值增长了78.2％，钢增长73.9％，生铁增长三点九倍，原煤增长二点四倍，硫酸增长49％，棉纱增长26.6％，其他各种工业产品，也都有很大的增产。各种工业产品不仅数量上有很大的增长，而且质量也在不断地改进和提高。基本建设工作量增长了88.3％。各种运输工具货运量增长90％。去年的大跃进和今年七个多月来工农业生产建设的新成就，使全省经济战线的若干方面发生了极其深刻的变化。如：过去全省重点钢厂炼钢所用的生铁绝大部分由外省供应，现在90％以上都由本省供应；许多过去不能自制的设备也能自造了；供应市场的轻工业产品中，本省产品的比重有了很大的增加。
    在农业方面，由于实现了人民公社化，1959年的小春生产已经获得空前大丰收，粮食总产量增加30％，比特大丰收的1958年增产幅度还要大。大春生产虽然遭受了数十年来未有的严重旱灾，在一部分地区旱灾以后又遭到了严重的洪、涝、风、虫等灾害，但是在党的领导下，广大干部和农民群众以人定胜天的英雄气概，展开了热火朝天的抗旱、抗灾斗争，及时进行了增种、补种、改种，大大地减轻了旱灾造成的损失，并且能够保证继续获得增产。在商业方面，由于工农业生产的大跃进，今年1至7月份购进总额比去年同期增长了48％，社会商品零售总额增长了38％。绝大多数主要商品的销售量比去年同期都有很大的增长。
    指示说明，根据国家统一计划，和统计部门对全省粮棉产量统计的核实数字，并考虑到今年七个月来国民经济计划的执行情况和农业生产上遇到的严重旱灾，有必要对1959年国民经济计划，进行必要的调整：钢的产量定为一百万吨（不包括土钢），比去年增长61％；原煤产量定为三千三百万吨，比去年增长62.7％；粮食比最后核实的去年产量六百五十亿斤增长10％左右；棉花的产量比最后核实的去年产量一百八十万担增长20％左右。显然，调整后的钢、煤、粮、棉的指标，仍然是一个大跃进的指标，也是更能够鼓舞和提高广大群众积极性的指标。
    为了保证全面地完成今年的国民经济计划，指示要求工业、农业、运输业都应普遍深入地开展社会主义劳动竞赛，努力增产。农业生产当前首要任务是必须把抗旱、抗灾斗争进行到底，继续完成增种任务，并加强大春和增种作物的管理工作，保证多种、多收。秋收是夺取农业增产的最后战役，必须集中力量，做到收好、打好、交售好、分配好、保管好。作到重灾区要保产，轻灾区要增产，基本无灾区要大大增产。要充分作好小春生产的各项准备工作，适时完成播种任务；认真执行多种多收和少种多收相结合的方针，积极扩大小春种植面积，提高单位面积产量。大力发展林、牧、副、渔等多种经营，大量增加商品生产，增加市场供应，增加公社收入。一切工业生产必须坚持贯彻高产、高质、高工效、低成本和安全生产的总要求。首先要尽最大的努力增加钢、铁、煤焦的生产。交通运输必须坚决贯彻以运保工、保农、保商的方针，力争提前和超额完成今年运输计划。商业工作必须配合工农业增产，狠狠地抓紧完成购销计划，不容许有任何忽视。
    指示指出，增产必须同时节约。要在全体干部和全体人民中，大张旗鼓地、深入地进行勤俭节约的教育，使勤俭建国、勤俭办人民公社、勤俭办一切事业的方针深入人心。农村人民公社必须注意大力节约粮食，安排好社员生活。各工业交通部门、各厂矿企业都应按平均先进定额订出节约计划，在保证质量的条件下，大力节约各种原料、材料、动力、运力和劳动力。所有机关、部队、团体、企业、事业单位，都应坚决节省一切可以节省的开支。指示强调指出：必须在一切公社、一切厂矿、企业、事业等部门中，继续坚持政治挂帅，严肃批判和彻底克服右倾思想，进一步坚定革命意志，保证党的坚强领导。继续放手发动群众，调动一切积极因素，把增产节约运动迅速推向新的高峰。
    指示最后号召，各级领导干部要拿出去年大办钢铁和突击“四秋”的劲头来，密切地联系群众，依靠群众，拿出分秒必争的战斗作风，运用行之有效的经验，以先进带动中间、提高落后的工作方法，及时、果断、准确地处理生产中的各项问题。特别是在工农业生产的紧要关头，领导干部更加要亲自上阵，深入生产第一线，与群众同甘苦共患难，同群众一起战胜困难，更出色地完成任务。
