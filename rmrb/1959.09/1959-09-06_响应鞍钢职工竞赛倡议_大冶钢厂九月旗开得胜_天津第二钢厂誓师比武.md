Xinhua News Agency report: Responding to the challenge from Anshan Iron and Steel, the workers of Daye Steel Plant achieved initial success in September. In the first three days, they overproduced steel by 215 tons, with average daily output increasing by 19% compared to the previous month, and quality also significantly improved.

After overfulfilling the August plan, all the workers of Daye Steel Plant immediately responded to the initiative put forward by the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule.

Currently, the workers of Daye Steel Plant are engaged in a heated mass campaign involving ten thousand people and one thousand groups. The workers of three shifts in the converter workshop took the lead in promoting the experience of the horseshoe-shaped furnace body from Qingdao Steel Plant, changing the single row of tuyeres to a double row, concentrating the air power, and shortening the smelting time for each furnace of steel from an average of 40 minutes in August to less than 35 minutes. The oven team workers, disregarding the scorching heat, raised the oven temperature from the original 800 degrees to over 1000 degrees, extending the lifespan of the converter from 30 times to 40 times. The iron smelting furnace workers adopted the method of hot excavation and hot repair, increasing the lifespan of the iron smelting furnace from the original 300 times to more than 700 times, ensuring the supply of molten iron. In this way, the entire workshop overproduced more than 40 tons of qualified steel on the first day, making a good start. On September 2nd, workers in other workshops such as open-hearth and electric furnaces also successively studied and adopted new steelmaking methods.

Xinhua News Agency report: The workers of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, Tianjin's largest steel plant, have resolved to complete the annual steel production plan 15 days ahead of schedule, responding to Anshan Iron and Steel's friendly competition initiative.

Encouraged by the great combat call of the Party Central Committee, the workers of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant overfulfilled the steel production plan for August by 1,078 tons, with steel production increasing by about 63% compared to July. On August 31st, the whole plant held a victory report and oath-taking skills competition rally, unanimously passing a resolution to warmly respond to the initiative of the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. They guaranteed: to complete the annual steel production plan 15 days ahead of schedule; that with a more abundant source of raw materials in September, the daily production level will be doubled compared to August; to further improve enterprise management, increase labor productivity, reduce consumption, and reduce the cost of each ton of steel by 26% compared to the first half of the year in the next four months; and to eliminate major industrial and equipment accidents.

In the first two days of September, six new records appeared throughout the plant. The workers of the Chen Yunsheng team, with clear division of labor and close cooperation, created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in 18 minutes. Then, the Liu Hongxun team changed the original two slagging operations for smelting a furnace of steel to one slagging operation, smelting a furnace of first-class steel in 16 minutes.

    响应鞍钢职工竞赛倡议
    大冶钢厂九月旗开得胜  天津第二钢厂誓师比武
    据新华社讯　大冶钢厂职工向鞍钢应战，9月份旗开得胜，头三天共超产钢二百一十五吨，平均日产量比上月增长19％，质量也有显著提高。
    大冶钢厂全体职工在超额完成8月份计划之后，立即响应了鞍钢职工提出的提前完成今年计划的倡议。
    目前，大冶钢厂职工们正在展开热火朝天的万人千组大竞赛。转炉车间三个班的工人一马领先，共同推广了青岛钢厂马蹄形炉体经验，把单排风眼改成双排风眼，集中风力，使每炉钢的吹炼时间由8月份平均四十分钟缩短到三十五分钟以下。烤炉组工人不顾逼人烈火，把烤炉温度由原来的八百度提高到一千度以上，使转炉炉龄由三十次延长到四十次。化铁炉工人采用热挖热补办法，把化铁炉炉龄由原来的三百次提高到七百多次，保证了铁水的供应。这样，全车间头一天就超产四十多吨合格钢，打响了头一炮。9月2日，平炉、电炉等各车间工人也相继研究和采用新的炼钢方法。
    据新华社讯　天津最大炼钢厂——天津第二钢厂的职工已下定决心提前十五天完成全年钢产计划，响应鞍钢的友谊竞赛倡议。
    天津第二钢厂职工在党中央的伟大战斗号召鼓舞下，8月份超额一千零七十八吨完成了钢产计划，钢产量比7月份增长63％左右。8月31日，全厂召开报捷誓师比武大会，一致通过决议，热烈响应鞍钢职工的倡议。他们保证：提前十五天完成全年钢产计划；9月份随着原料来源更加充沛，日产水平要比8月份提高一倍；进一步改进企业管理，提高劳动生产率，降低消耗，使今后四个月每吨钢的成本比上半年降低26％；消灭重大工伤事故和设备事故。
    9月份的头两天里，全厂就出现了六项新纪录。陈云生小组工人分工明确，密切配合，创造了十八分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。接着，刘洪勋小组将原来炼一炉钢造两次渣改为造一次渣，十六分钟内炼出了一炉一级品钢。
