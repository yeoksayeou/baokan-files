Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th dispatch: One and a half million Japanese workers, students, and people from all walks of life, from Kyushu in the south to Hokkaido in the north, today launched the sixth national unified action in 300 locations across the country to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

In order to suppress this unified action, the Nobusuke Kishi government dispatched police to "guard" various parts of the country, but the unified action proceeded as originally planned in various locations. The characteristic of this action is that it linked the struggle against the "Security Treaty," the struggle against the "performance rating" system, and the struggle to support the Tokyo District Court's fair ruling on the "Sunagawa Incident," forming an extremely broad patriotic and democratic unified action.

The Japanese working class stood at the forefront of the struggle, with 55 trade unions holding strikes and workplace rallies in various places.

In Tokyo, groups and organizations participating in the Sixth National Unified Action held a central rally in Sunagawa Town next to the U.S. Air Force Tachikawa Base. Three thousand workers, students, and citizens participated in the rally. The assembly unanimously passed four resolutions: oppose the revision of the "Security Treaty"; oppose the "performance rating" system; support the Tokyo District Court's ruling on the "Sunagawa Incident"; and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, said at the meeting that the fact that the United States has established approximately 540 military bases and facilities in Japan proves that Japan does not enjoy full independence. He demanded that the U.S. military withdraw from Japan and abolish its bases in Japan.

Asanuma expressed his support for the Tokyo District Court's ruling that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan violates the Japanese Constitution. The Japanese people's struggle to support this ruling will surely be victorious because it is a just struggle.

Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), as well as the mayor of Sunagawa Town, also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, the participants held a lantern parade around the U.S. military base.

    反对日美“安全条约”斗争的新高潮
    日本人民展开第六次统一行动
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：南起九州北至北海道的一百五十万日本工人、学生和各阶层人民，今天在全国三百个地方展开了阻止修改日美“安全条约”第六次全国统一行动。
    为了镇压这次统一行动，岸信介政府竟出动警察在全国各地“戒备”，但是统一行动按原订计划在各地进行。这次行动的特点是把反对“安全条约”、反对“勤务评定”制度和支持东京地方裁判所对“砂川事件”公正判决的斗争联结在一起进行，形成了一个极广泛的爱国民主统一行动。
    日本工人阶级站在斗争的最前线，五十五个工会在各地举行了罢工和召开了工作场所大会。
    在东京，参加第六次全国统一行动的团体和组织在美国空军立川基地旁边的砂川町举行了中央大会，参加大会的有三千名工人、学生和市民。大会一致通过了四点决议：反对修改“安全条约”；反对“勤务评定”制度；支持东京地方裁判所关于“砂川事件”的判决；打倒岸信介内阁。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在会上讲话说，现在美国在日本建立大约五百四十个军事基地和设施，它证明了这样的事实：日本并没有享受充分的独立。他要求美军撤出日本和取消它在日本的基地。
    浅沼表示支持东京地方裁判所关于美军驻扎在日本是违反日本宪法的判决。日本人民为支持这个判决而展开的斗争，一定会取得胜利，因为这是正义的斗争。
    日本共产党和日本工会总评议会的代表以及砂川町町长都在会上讲了话。会后，参加大会的人在美军基地周围举行了提灯示威游行。
