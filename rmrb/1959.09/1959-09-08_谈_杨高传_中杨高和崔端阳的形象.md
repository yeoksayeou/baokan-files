    On the Images of Yang Gao and Cui Duanyang in "The Biography of Yang Gao"
    Liu Lanshan
    "May Duanyang" and "The Red Army Brother is Back" are the first two parts of Comrade Li Ji's recent long narrative poem "The Biography of Yang Gao." The poem features several characters, such as the blind storyteller, Cui's mother, Liu Zhidan, Hu An, and Hu Guiye, but they all occupy secondary positions in the long poem. The poem focuses on portraying Yang Gao and Cui Duanyang. After the publication of the two long poems (now published as separate books), they aroused the interest of readers, and many evaluation articles were published in newspapers and periodicals, exploring the ideological and artistic aspects of the poem. Here, I only attempt to explore the two artistic images created by the poet.
    After reading "May Duanyang," it is like listening to a folk song. An orphaned shepherd boy "who doesn't know his name or origin, without parents or home," immediately attracts people. This is not for any other reason than because in semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, countless peasants like Yang Gao's parents were murdered by feudal landlords and imperialist agents! And even more countless shared the same fate as Yang Gao! Therefore, this image, emerging from folk songs and reality, has generality and typicality. Moreover, under the author's passionate pen, it is full of poetic flavor, and the reader is naturally drawn into the world he created.
    An orphan who has been without a home or relatives since childhood, "not knowing the taste of hot food, used to the dog's teeth and the whites of people's eyes," as a descendant of a martyr and the embodiment of the suffering, his unwillingness to be a "lamb" and to be used as a beast of burden by the rich is also very natural. Because of these descriptions from the depths of life, Yang Gao's later participation in the revolution, love for the revolution, regarding the revolutionary ranks as his home, and his revolutionary optimism of not fearing any hardship or sacrifice for the revolution have a class origin and realistic foundation, making it not feel sudden at all.
    I think the outstanding portrayal of Yang Gao's character is best achieved in the description of parting with the sheep in the chapter "'Lamb' and Sheep," reaching a touching state of sincerity and simplicity. Those heartfelt farewell words and repeated advice not only show Yang Gao's deep feelings for animals, but also shape a beautiful image of a pure son of the working people and his great ambition to transform the world. In "Joining the Party," Yang Gao is wounded in battle while scouting enemy positions. "His face pale as paper with pain, breathless" as he reports the enemy situation, he even begins to engage in self-criticism. When the instructor waves his hand, urging him not to speak further, he smiles at everyone and says: "It doesn't matter—how could I, Yang Gao, die so easily!" This bold statement, spoken off the cuff, is both a review and an outlook, revealing the noble heart of a revolutionary hero and leaving a very deep impression on people. The growth process of such a revolutionary hero has a strong realistic educational significance.
    "May Duanyang" focuses on writing about Yang Gao's growth. The author deliberately arranged several Duanyang Festival scenes, which not only created an atmosphere, added color, and endowed the work with a strong folk flavor, but also played a role in setting off and reflecting the characters and plot development. When Yang Gao was first chased by the White bandits and escaped into Xiao Duanyang's home, the first seed of affection was planted. From the second time Yang Gao recovered from his injuries at the Cui's home, this seed sprouted and grew. Since then, Yang Gao's image lived in the hearts of Xiao Duanyang and her mother, and gradually became prominent. This is a method of using reflection to project in a larger background, which is used well by the author. However, what is unsatisfactory is that although Yang Gao's character is flesh and blood, he seems to be swimming forward in deep water all the time. People only see his head, and the rest is all vast water. He is submerged in the water. That is to say, the contradiction between this specific typical character and the typical environment has not been revealed most profoundly and concentratedly. The author wrote too much about the character's life experience. For example, the plot of Yang Gao being caught back by the landlord for herding sheep for the second time is neither well described nor does it seem necessary. There are similar narrative statements of this kind in the poem. Because of this, the first part of "May Duanyang" is like a slow stream, without any waves; only the latter part—that is, after contact with Cui Duanyang's family—has some ups and downs. Overall, this work is relatively bland. The focus of "The Red Army Brother is Back" is on Cui Duanyang. If the artistic image in the previous one was not portrayed concentratedly and prominently enough, resulting in a bland feeling; then, this was overcome in the latter one. I think this is the reason why the general reader prefers "The Red Army Brother is Back."
    With the progress of the times, Yang Gao went to the anti-Japanese front through the path of civil war, passed through the gates of death many times, and finally returned to his hometown of Sanbian with a body full of scars and a crippled arm. This image of the warrior in "May Duanyang" is now rarely seen, but he always lives in the hearts of the people in the rear. On this screen, the author strives to show Duanyang's heart and reveal her suffering fate, making her image prominent and vivid. In the years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to win the victory of the national liberation war, mothers and wives had to send their sons and husbands to the front line, but many years had passed without any news. How could they not think about them day and night! The author grasped this contradiction and tried to unfold the tender-hearted descriptions of missing the people at the front, making the image of Duanyang and her mother full, thereby integrating revolutionary heroism and revolutionary humanism, and sculpting a beautiful and moving type of Chinese rural woman. I think that when people read these poems, no one will be unmoved. Look at the beating of the heart of Duanyang's mother who misses Yang Gao:
    "Parents' hearts are a piece of flesh, thinking about the children at the front day and night.
    Victory at the front brings joy to the rear, heart to heart, flesh to flesh, ten fingers connected to the heart." And what is the heart of the girl Duanyang after she wins the red flag in wasteland reclamation and is praised by the people?
    "The more I think about it, the happier I am, chanting Yang Gao's name over and over again.
    It's all because I'm thinking of you, reciting your name gives me strength."
    She wants him not to think about her at the front, to "rest well at night and have enough energy to fight more victories," but she can't stop her heart from wandering. She sits by the spinning wheel and wants to become a bird, and then she thinks of him eating millet at the front, and the biggest grain of rice is herself; thinking and forgetting to continue the cotton, and continuing the cotton she thinks:
    "The younger sister is like a silkworm, spitting silk threads from the heart for thousands of feet;
    There is also a time when silkworm silk is exhausted, the younger sister's heart is longer than that silkworm silk.
    So thin and white for thousands of feet, pulled straight from Sanbian to the front.
    One end is tied to the younger sister's heart, and the other end is tightly tied to your heart.
    Snow-white thread is spun by hand, transmitting cold, heat, and thoughts.
    When it snows there, I feel cold, when the thread is hot, I know you have won a victory.
    The thread is the younger sister's heart, and the younger sister tears her heart into a thread to be by your side.
    There is cold and heat in all seasons, and the younger sister's heart is better than the sun in the sky."
    This is truly a wonderful lyric describing revolutionary love and a vivid picture of a sentimental girl.
    Yang Gao changed his name to Yang Hongzhi and Duanyang lived in the home of the evil uncle Hu An after the death of their mother, and a series of twists and turns arising from this reached a climax, which is Duanyang's four pursuits of Yang Gao. The vast snowy night, the vast sandy plains, the impassioned shouts, the reproach containing smiles and the protection containing resentment, are written quite movingly, and finally, the clouds are cleared and the sun shines on the world again! At this time, the poet used many "laugh" characters to express the mood of the people's heroes. Through these laughter, it showed the end of suffering and the dawn of a bright future. This is the laugh of victory, and it will leave a deep impression in people's hearts, as the poem profoundly implies:
    "Talking and laughing, they walked away,
    Leaving pairs of footprints in the snow."
    Another May Duanyang arrived. This is the last and forever memorable May Duanyang. Due to Hu An's betrayal, Yang Gao was captured while scouting in the early stage of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region counter-attack and refused to surrender. The enemy brought Duanyang and Guiye to persuade him to surrender. However, the answer of these two daughters of the border region was: "Since we were caught, we don't plan to live. Asking us to persuade Hongzhi is wishful thinking!" The enemy is extremely cruel. Rather than for money, it is for class hatred. Hu An brought the enemy to catch his own daughter and niece; and for class hatred, the vicious enemy could do any "cruel thing in the world." Now at the execution ground, Duanyang and Yang Gao met, and the bayonets were flashing. Duanyang, oh Duanyang, what to do? Listen to the enemy telling you how to speak:
    "Surrender and give in for my life" If you don't say it, then the enemy is shouting again:
    "Brothers, point the blade at her neck!"
    What to do? Daughters of Sanbian! What to do? This is the most critical moment! Look at the fire of hatred in Yang Gao's eyes. You spoke naturally but loudly, as if you were talking to Yang Gao as you usually did:
    "Men of Sanbian are heroes, daughters of Sanbian are like iron!
    Brother, you will never bow your head, let us greet tomorrow with our blood!" In the early days of the War of Liberation, at the last moment before the start of the great counteroffensive, Duanyang fell heroically like this! The space used in this episode is not large, but it made the final and most important portrayal of the heroic figure of Duanyang. Here, the author did not even write about Duanyang's thoughts and feelings before her heroic sacrifice, but the reader can fully understand in the excitement. Because she is a person from the border area, a descendant of a revolutionary martyr, an advanced element on the labor front, a wife of a revolutionary hero and a communist party member, and a girl who has been tempered by thousands of hardships. Because of this, as long as the character's characteristics are grasped, a few simple and concise strokes can highlight the character's image.
    In general, in these two long poems, the image of Cui Duanyang is vividly portrayed and reaches personalization; while Yang Gao's character is more rigid, and the personalization is not enough. These are just some of my thoughts after reading these two works, which may not be correct. I put them forward for discussion.

    谈“杨高传”中杨高和崔端阳的形象
    刘岚山
    “五月端阳”和“当红军的哥哥回来了”是李季同志近著长篇叙事诗“杨高传”的前两部。诗中写了好几个人物，如盲说书人、崔老妈妈、刘志丹、胡安和胡桂叶等，不过他们在长诗中都是处于次要地位；长诗着重刻画的是杨高和崔端阳。两部长诗发表（现在已分别出版单行本）以后，引起了读者的兴趣，报刊上发表了不少评价文章，探讨了长诗的思想性和艺术性。我在这里，仅仅试图探索一下诗人创造的这两个艺术形象。
    读完“五月端阳”，仿佛是听了一曲民谣一样。一个“不知名不知姓没有家乡”、无父无母的小羊倌，一开始就把人吸引住了。这不是别的原因，而是因为在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，像杨高父母那样被封建地主与帝国主义代理人谋杀了的农民，不知有多少！而和杨高共同命运的更是成千成万！因而，这个从民谣中也是从现实中走出来的形象，是具有概括性和典型性的，并且，在作者热情饱满的笔下，诗意葱茏，读者很自然地被诗人带入他所创造的世界。
    自小无家无亲的“不知道热饭啥味道，看惯了狗的牙人的白眼”的孤儿，作为一个先烈的后代，作为受苦人的化身，他不甘心做“羊羔”、被财主当牛马使唤的性格，也是很自然的。由于这些来自生活深处的描写，杨高后来参加革命、热爱革命、以革命队伍为家、为革命不怕任何艰苦困难、不惜流血牺牲的革命乐观主义气概，就有了阶级根源和现实基础，使人一点也不感觉突然。
    对杨高性格的突出刻画，我觉得在“‘羊羔’和羊”一章内的别羊的描写上，达到了憨厚、浑朴的动人境地。那些出自腑肺的临别赠言、叮咛复叮咛的劝告等，不仅仅表现了杨高对于动物的深厚感情，并且塑造出一个优美的劳动人民儿子的纯朴形象和要改造世界的伟大抱负。而在“入党记”中，杨高因侦察敌情而遭遇战斗负伤，“疼的脸像一张纸，想说话上气不接下气”地汇报敌情后，还自我检讨起来。当指导员摇摇手，劝他不要再说话时，他却对大家笑着说：“不要紧——我杨高怎么会随便死了！”这句脱口而出的豪语，既是回顾又是展望，揭示了一个革命英雄的崇高心灵，给人以极深的印象。这样一个革命英雄的成长过程，是具有强烈的现实教育意义的。
      “五月端阳”以写杨高的成长为主。作者特意安排了几个端阳节的场面，这不仅创造了气氛，加重了色彩，赋予作品以浓郁的民间情调，而且在人物形象和情节发展上也有烘托和衬映的作用。当杨高第一次被白匪穷追而逃入小端阳家，种下第一颗感情的种子，从第二次杨高在崔家养伤起，这种子就发芽生长。从此，杨高的形象就生活在小端阳及其母亲的心中，并且逐渐地突出起来。这是作者在较大的背景上，利用返射来投影的一种方法，运用得很好。然而令人感到不满足的是：杨高这个人物虽然是有血有肉的，但他却好像始终在深水中游泳着前进，人们只看见他的头部，此外就全是浩淼的水波。他淹没在水里。这就是说，这个具体的典型性格和典型环境的矛盾，没有得到最深刻、最集中的揭露，作者对于人物的生活经历写得太多了，例如杨高第二次被地主抓回来放羊的情节，既没有好好地描写，也见不出有什么必要。类似这类交代性质的叙述，诗里还有。正因为这样，“五月端阳”前一部分仿佛一川缓流，没有什么波浪；后一部分——即和崔端阳家发生联系后，才有一些起伏。整个说来，这部作品是比较平淡的。“当红军的哥哥回来了”的重点放在崔端阳身上。如果说，前一部的艺术形象刻画得还不够集中与突出，以致有平淡的感觉；那么，在后一部中就得到了克服。我以为一般读者更喜爱“当红军的哥哥回来了”的原因在此。
    随着时代的进展，杨高通过内战的道路走上抗日前线，多次经过死亡门口，最后带着满身伤痕和一只残废的手臂重回故乡三边。这个“五月端阳”中的勇士形象，现在虽然很少出面，却时时生活在后方人的心里。在这个画面上，作者竭力展示端阳的心灵，揭开她的苦难命运，使她的形象突出和生动。在抗战年代里，为了民族解放战争的胜利，母亲和妻子们不能不把儿子和丈夫送上前线，但是，许多年过去了，却连一个音信也没有，她们又怎能不日思夜想呢！作者抓住了这个矛盾，竭力展开了含情脉脉的思念前方人的描写，使端阳和母亲的形象丰满起来，从而把革命英雄主义和革命人道主义融于一体，雕塑出中国农村妇女的美丽动人的典型。我想，当人们读到这些诗句的时候，没有会不动心的。请看端阳母亲思念杨高的那颗心的跳动吧：
    “爹娘心上一块肉，昼夜里惦念着前方儿郎。
    前线胜利后方喜，心连心肉连肉十指连心。”而在开荒劳动中获得红旗，被人们称赞后，少女端阳的心又是怎样呢？
    “心里越想越高兴，一遍遍把杨高念在嘴上。
    这都是因为想着你，念着你的名字就有力量。”
    她要他在前方不要想她，夜晚要“休息好精神足再打胜仗”，但她却止不住自己的心驰神往，她坐在纺车旁一下想变一只鸟，一下又想到他在前方吃黄米饭，那最大的米粒就是自己；想着想着忘了续棉花，续上棉花又想：
    “妹妹好比一条蚕，从心里吐丝线千丈万丈；
    蚕丝也有吐尽时，妹的心要比那蚕丝还长。
    又细又白千万丈，从三边直拉到前方。
    一头拴在妹心里，那一头紧拴在你的心上。
    雪白的线儿亲手纺，又传冷又传热又传思想。
    你那里下雪我身上冷，线儿热我知道你打了胜仗。
    线儿就是妹的心，妹把心扯成线跟你身旁。
    一年四季有冷热，妹的心赛过那天上太阳。”
    这真是一阕描写革命爱情的绝妙好词和一个多情少女维妙维肖的图画。
    杨高改名杨红志和端阳在母亲去世后寄居坏蛋舅舅胡安家，以及由此而产生的一系列波折，达到了一个高潮，这就是端阳四追杨高。那茫茫风雪夜、那广袤的沙原、那激越的呼喊，那含着笑的责备和那含着怨的袒护，写得相当动人，最后拨开了云雾，太阳重新照临人间！这时候，诗人用了许多“笑”字来表现人民英雄们的心情。通过这些笑声，表现了苦尽甘来，展示了光明前景。这是胜利的笑，它在人们心中也会留下如诗里含意深远地所写的印象：
      “说着笑着走远了，
    雪地上留下了对对脚踪。”
    又到了一个五月端阳了。这是最后的、也是永远值得人们纪念的五月端阳。由于胡安的出卖，杨高在陕北反击战初期因侦察被俘不屈后，敌人捉来端阳和桂叶，要她们劝降。但是，这两个边区女儿的回答是：“既然被抓我们就不打算活，叫我们劝红志那是妄想！”敌人是无比残酷的。与其说为了钱财不如说是为了阶级仇恨，胡安带着敌人捉了自己的女儿和外甥女；而为了阶级仇恨，凶恶的敌人更是什么“天地间残忍事”都干得出来的。现在到了刑场上，端阳和杨高见面了，刺刀在闪动着。端阳呵端阳，怎么办呢？你听敌人在教你怎样说话了：
    “为了我一条命你低头归降”如果你不说呢，那么，敌人又在喊了：
    “兄弟们，把刀刃对准她脖子上！”
    怎么办呢？三边的女儿呵！怎么办呢？这是最紧要的时刻了！你看看杨高眼里射出充满仇恨的火光，你好像平素和杨高在一起时谈话那样，自然地但却大声地说了：
    “三边的男子英雄汉，三边的女儿铁一般！
    哥哥你永远不低头，让我们用鲜血迎接明天！”在解放战争最初的时日，在大反攻开始前的最后一刻，端阳就这样英勇地倒下了！这个情节所用的篇幅不多，但对端阳这个英雄人物形象却作了最后的最重要的刻画。在这里，作者甚至没有去写端阳英勇就义前的思想感情，但读者却能在激动中十分了然的。因为她是一个边区人，一个革命先烈的后代，一个劳动战线上的先进分子，一个革命英雄、共产党员的妻子，一个受过千苦万难磨炼过来的姑娘。正因为这样，只要抓住人物的性格特点，简单扼要的几笔也是能够把人物形象突出起来的。
    总起来说，在这两部长诗中，崔端阳的形象是塑造得鲜明突出，达到了个性化的；而杨高的性格则比较呆板，个性化还不够。这只是我读了这两部作品后的一些想法，不一定对，提出来供商讨。
