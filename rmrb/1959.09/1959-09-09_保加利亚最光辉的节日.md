Bulgaria's Most Glorious Festival
Fu Qi'erwenkefu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Community Party, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria

The Bulgarian people are commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of their liberation from fascist enslavement and imperialist subjugation. On September 9, 1944, the Bulgarian people, united under the leadership of the Communist Party into a broad anti-fascist front and relying on the great victory of the Soviet army, staged an armed uprising, overthrew the bourgeois regime, and took their destiny into their own hands.

The result of the September 9th Uprising was the victory of the long-standing heroic struggle of the Bulgarian workers and peasants against capitalism. This uprising opened the way for Bulgaria to embark on socialist construction.

Now, as the Bulgarian people celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of liberation, they feel joy and pride in the realization that the socialist system has triumphed. As early as last year, the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party announced this victory. Full of creative socialist energy, Bulgaria is advancing confidently in the fraternal socialist family headed by the Soviet Union.

The Bulgarian people look back with great satisfaction on the difficult, glorious, and correct path they have traveled over the past fifteen years, and on the fruits of their free labor, Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, and fraternal cooperation with the peoples of all socialist countries. The victories achieved are great. The working people of Bulgaria are constantly striving to overcome the long-standing backwardness as quickly as possible, and to create all the preconditions for an unprecedented boom in the economy and to improve the material welfare and national culture of the people as quickly as possible. Their efforts have achieved due success. The achievements already made have strengthened the people's confidence in striving for greater victories and aroused new and beautiful aspirations.

The achievements of socialist Bulgaria over the past fifteen years prove that once the people become their own masters, and cherish the unity and mutual cooperation with other socialist countries and peoples (whether large or small) as they cherish the apple of their eye, and firmly follow the Communist Party, then even a small population can accomplish great things.

The rule of the Bulgarian bourgeoisie lasted for about seventy years. What was bourgeois Bulgaria like?

It was a weak country, cruelly plundered by its own and foreign exploiters. It had no large heavy industry. For example, electricity production in 1939 was only 260 million kilowatt-hours, and coal production was about 2 million tons. In the past, the technological level of industry was extremely poor, labor productivity was very low, and there was no raw material base of its own. 65% of the raw materials needed for light industry were imported from abroad. Frankly speaking, these were declining industries. 95% of the national income was consumed by non-productive expenditures. The vast majority of this income was seized by monopoly organizations, large landowners, and big capitalists. Investment in industry accounted for only 4% to 5% of the national income.

This shaky industry has not been able to truly become the basis for the development of agriculture. In capitalist Bulgaria, agriculture was extremely backward. Farmers lacked land, were exploited by usurers, were oppressed by exorbitant taxes and levies, and lived a precarious life. Prices soared in both urban and rural areas, and famine was widespread. Therefore, the national economy has always been in crisis, and unemployment has become a common phenomenon. The Bulgarian bourgeoisie, as the ruling class, essentially helped imperialism exploit the people. For decades, the bourgeoisie has been trying to make the Bulgarian people disbelieve in their own strength.

The most representative feature of the new Bulgaria is its rapid socialist industrialization. Its machine manufacturing, electricity production, chemical industry, non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgical industries are constantly growing and developing. The face of the country is changing day by day. Many brand-new industrial zones, dozens of new large factories and power stations with modern equipment, and dams have sprung up.

Compared with 1939, the total industrial output value has increased about eight times, while the production of means of production has increased seventeen times! From 1948 to 1958, the production of means of production increased four times, and the production of consumer goods increased three times. Before 1939, the total output value of capitalist industry accounted for about a quarter of the total social output value; while in 1958, the output value of socialist industry accounted for about two-thirds of the total social output value.

Compared with 1939, the production of electricity and heat energy has increased tenfold, coal—more than fivefold, ferrous metal ore—forty-twofold, non-ferrous metal ore—one hundred and thirty-fourfold. Machine manufacturing and metal processing industries—fiftyfold, chemical industry—twentyfold, building materials industry—seventeenfold, and so on.

The fixed assets of the republic, local, and cooperative industries have increased more than sixfold compared with 1939, and mainly due to the increase in the production of means of production…. In 1958 alone, the newly added fixed assets in Bulgaria's industry were equivalent to the fixed assets received by the people's democratic revolution on September 9, 1944. In 1958, Bulgaria's industry produced in forty-five days the equivalent of the entire year of 1939. In terms of industrial development speed and per capita output of certain industrial products, Bulgaria has surpassed its neighboring capitalist countries—Greece and Turkey, and some other capitalist countries.

Only on the basis of socialism, only under the conditions of the existence of the people's power, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party, can the national industrialization have such a large scale and fully benefit the people.

Bulgaria's agriculture has undergone a thorough socialist transformation. Nine hundred and seventy-five vibrant and huge agricultural cooperatives (averaging four to five thousand hectares of land per cooperative), two hundred and ten machine tractor stations, and fifty-three state farms—this is the foundation of Bulgarian socialist agriculture. Now there are approximately 30,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower), 6,500 combine harvesters, 8,000 trucks, approximately 20,000 tractor plows, and thousands of other agricultural machines in agriculture. It should also be pointed out that the cultivated area is 4.7 million hectares. These figures prove that the mechanization of major agricultural labor is already at a considerable level. In 1939, machines accounted for only 7% of the total power in agriculture, while in 1957, machines accounted for 70%. Chemical fertilizers are now being used more and more, while in old Bulgaria there was almost no chemical fertilizer. This year, the average chemical fertilizer is one hundred and forty-five kilograms per hectare of land. Water conservancy and soil improvement work is now being carried out on a large scale. In the first seven months of this year alone, the project of irrigating 180,000 hectares of land was completed. In old Bulgaria, it took about seventy years to complete the project that could only irrigate 36,000 hectares of land. Bulgarian agriculture is increasingly becoming an intensive agriculture with increasing productivity. In 1957, Bulgarian agricultural products increased by 43% compared with before the war.

On the basis of the great victories achieved in industrialization and agricultural cooperativization, the material welfare of the people is constantly growing.

The life of the Bulgarian people is now incomparably better than in the past. Compared with 1952, real wages increased by 75% in 1958, and the income of collective farmers increased by 80%. During this period, retail trade more than doubled. The large-scale housing construction throughout the country, especially in rural areas, is a clear sign of the improvement of the people's living welfare. It can be said with certainty that the Bulgarian countryside has been completely renewed from the inside out. Many new and well-lit houses have been built in the countryside, which is becoming increasingly beautiful.

Socialist Bulgaria has made great achievements in the cultural revolution in national education, health care, art, science, and other aspects. The entire ideological front is developing on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and is increasingly closely linked with the practical tasks of socialist construction and with life. The works of Bulgarian writers, painters, and composers, and the creations of our actors, singers, and musicians have never been so loved and cared for by readers, audiences, and the entire people as they are now. They could never have performed abroad as frequently as they can now. Socialist Bulgaria is celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of its National Day at the beginning of a new stage of development, at the height of the nationwide movement to strive for the early completion of the Three-Year Plan and to achieve an economic leap forward.

According to the resolution of the Seventh Party Congress, and in view of the enormous possibilities and potentials that have been explored, the Central Committee of the Party and the government have formulated a plan for the accelerated development of the country from 1959 to 1962-1965. Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, clarified and demonstrated the main contents of the plan in his report to the National Assembly. The National Assembly approved the plan and made it law. This plan is now a great construction program for the entire Bulgarian people. The completion of this plan will mean a great development of productive forces, thereby greatly expanding and strengthening the material and production base of socialism, and increasingly moving towards a stage of gradual transition to communism. The plan stipulates that industrial production should be approximately doubled by 1962, and that by 1965 it should increase by two to three times compared with 1957, that is, by twenty-four to twenty-nine times compared with the industrial production in 1939. The plan stipulates that in 1965, Bulgaria's own production should meet more than half of Bulgaria's needs for ferrous metals and steel. In 1965, compared with 1957, the production of machinery and metal products will be four times more, the production of hard coal will be two times more, the products of the chemical industry will be six times more, and electricity production will reach 10 billion kilowatt-hours.

Thus, by 1956, the increase in industrial products per capita was as follows: electricity reached 1,457 kilowatt-hours (42 kilowatt-hours in 1939), hard coal was more than 5 tons (352 kilograms in 1939), steel was 129 kilograms (0.9 kilograms in 1939), cement was 493 kilograms (36 kilograms in 1939), cotton fabrics were 49.2 meters (5.4 meters in 1939), sugar was 61 kilograms, vegetable oil was 25 kilograms, etc.

The average annual absolute increase is stipulated to be twice as much as the total industrial products in 1939 by 1965.

By 1965, it is necessary to solve the problem of raw materials and the problem of producing abundant agricultural products. Agricultural production should increase by approximately two to three times by this period compared with 1957. National income will double, and real wages will increase by approximately 80%. This will greatly improve the material and cultural welfare of the socialist working people.

The task is great and arduous. But it is achievable, and it is within the capacity of the Bulgarian people. The results of the implementation of the plan this year actually prove that this task is achievable. The achievements are enormous. Industrial products increased by 24% in the first half of the year compared with the first half of last year, and retail trade increased accordingly by 14.4%. Great achievements have also been made in agriculture. There is no doubt that the plan for accelerating economic development has become a matter of life and death for the people, and it will definitely be successfully completed.

The Bulgarian people are welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of their National Day with this unwavering confidence. They are greeting the fifteenth anniversary with spiritual and political unity and action, closely united around their beloved and long-tested Bulgarian Communist Party. Because their achievements are first and foremost due to the wise leadership of this party. The Bulgarian Communist Party leads them forward with confidence and consistency, towards new and more brilliant victories. The Bulgarian people are welcoming their most glorious festival with deep gratitude to the great Soviet Union and the Soviet army that liberated us, and with the determination and will to cherish, strengthen, and develop the vigorous friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian people are welcoming the fifteenth anniversary with fraternal unity with the powerful Chinese people, with the people of all socialist countries, and with all peace-loving people in the world.

    保加利亚最光辉的节日
    保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员  保加利亚人民共和国部长会议副主席  伏·契尔文科夫
    保加利亚人民纪念自己摆脱法西斯奴役和摆脱对帝国主义的从属地位的十五周年。1944年9月9日，在共产党的领导下团结成广泛的反法西斯阵线的保加利亚人民，依靠苏军的伟大胜利，举行了武装起义，推翻了资产阶级政权，把自己的命运掌握在自己的手中。
      9月9日的起义的结果，保加利亚工人和农民长期以来反对资本主义的英勇斗争取得了胜利。这次起义开辟了保加利亚走向社会主义建设的道路。
    现在，保加利亚人民在庆祝解放十五周年的时候，由于意识到社会主义制度已经取得胜利而感到欢欣和骄傲。早在去年，保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会就宣布取得了这一胜利。充满创造力的社会主义的保加利亚，在以苏联为首的友爱的社会主义大家庭里，满怀信心地前进。
    保加利亚人民十分满意地回顾过去十五年所走过的艰难、光荣而正确的道路，回顾他们自由劳动、保苏友谊以及同一切社会主义国家人民的兄弟合作所得到的果实。取得的胜利是伟大的。保加利亚劳动人民不断努力，以便尽快地克服长期遗留下来的落后现象，尽快地创造一切先决条件，使经济获得空前的蓬勃发展，提高人民的物质福利和民族文化。他们的努力取得了应有的成就。已经取得的成就加强了人民争取更大胜利的信心，激起了新的美好的憧憬。
    十五年来，社会主义保加利亚的成就证明，人民一旦成为自己的主人，并且像爱护眼珠那样爱护同其他社会主义国家和人民（无论大国或小国）的团结和相互合作，坚定地跟着共产党走，那末即使人口不多，也能做出大事情来。
    保加利亚资产阶级的统治几乎延续了大约七十年。资产阶级的保加利亚又是个什么样子呢？
    这是一个衰弱的、遭受本国和外国剥削者残酷掠夺的国家。它没有任何大的重工业。例如，1939年的电力生产只有两亿六千万度，煤的生产大约二百万吨。过去工业的技术水平极差，劳动生产率很低，没有自己的原料基地。轻工业所必需的原料有65％是从国外进口的。老实说，这些都是没落的工业。国民收入的95％都消耗于非生产的开支。这种收入的极大部分都被垄断组织、大地主和大资本家所攫取。用于工业的投资不过只占国民收入的4％到5％。
    这种摇摇欲坠的工业没有能够真正成为发展农业的基础。在资本主义的保加利亚，农业是极其落后的。农民缺少土地，受高利贷的盘剥，受苛捐杂税的压迫，过着苟延残喘的生活。城乡各地物价飞涨，饥民遍野。因此国民经济一直处在危机中，失业已成为经常现象。作为统治阶级的保加利亚资产阶级，实质上帮着帝国主义剥削人民。资产阶级数十年来一直竭力使保加利亚人民不相信他们自己的力量。
    新保加利亚最具有代表性的特征，就是它的迅速的社会主义工业化。它的机器制造业、电力生产、化学工业、有色和黑色冶金工业不断成长，不断发展。国家的面貌日新月异。许多全新的工业区，数以十计的有现代化设备的新的大工厂、电站、水坝纷纷涌现。
    同1939年相比，工业总产值约增加八倍，而生产资料的生产增加十七倍！1948—1958年，生产资料的生产增加四倍，消费资料增加三倍。在1939年以前，资本主义工业总产值约占社会总产值的四分之一；而到1958年，社会主义工业的产值约占全社会产值的三分之二。
    同1939年相比，电力和热能的生产增加了十倍，煤——五倍多，黑色金属矿——四十二倍，有色金属矿——一百三十四倍。机器制造和金属加工工业——五十倍，化学工业——二十倍，建筑材料工业——十七倍，等等。
    共和国、地方和合作社工业的固定资产比1939年增加了六倍多，而且主要是靠生产资料的生产增加的……。仅在1958年，保加利亚工业新增加的固定资产就相当于1944年9月9日人民民主革命所接收下来的固定资产。在1958年，保加利亚工业四十五天的产量就相当于1939年全年的产量。就工业发展速度和某些工业品按人口平均计算的产量来说，保加利亚已经超过了和它毗邻的资本主义国家——希腊和土耳其，以及其他一些资本主义国家。
    只有在社会主义的基础上，只有在人民政权存在的条件下，只有在共产党的领导下，国家工业化才能有这么大的规模，才能完全为人民造福。
    保加利亚的农业已经进行了彻底的社会主义改造。九百七十五个富有生命力的、巨大的农业合作社（平均每个合作社有四、五千公顷土地）、二百一十个机器拖拉机站和五十三个国营农场——这就是保加利亚社会主义农业的基础。现在农业中大约已有三万台拖拉机（按十五匹马力计算）、六千五百台联合收割机、八千辆载重汽车、大约二万个拖拉机犁和成千上万个其他农业机器。还应该指出，耕种的面积有四百七十万公顷。这些数字证明，主要农业劳动的机械化程度已经不低了。1939年，在农业的全部动力中，机器只占7％，而在1957年，机器已经占70％。现在越来越多地利用化学肥料，而过去在旧保加利亚几乎没有化学肥料。今年每公顷土地平均有一百四十五公斤化学肥料。现在正在大规模地进行水利土壤改良工作。仅在今年七个月内就完成了灌溉十八万公顷土地的工程。在旧保加利亚，大约七十年内才完成了只能灌溉三万六千公顷土地的工程。保加利亚农业越来越多地成为生产率日益增长的集约农业。1957年保加利亚农产品比战前增加了43％。
    在工业化和农业合作化取得的巨大胜利的基础上，人民的物质福利不断增长。
    现在保加利亚人民的生活比过去好得无可比拟。同1952年相比，1958年实际工资增长了75％，集体农民的收入增长了80％。在这个时期，零售贸易扩大了一倍多。全国大规模的住宅建设，特别是农村的住宅建设乃是人民生活福利提高的明显的标志。可以肯定地说，保加利亚的农村从里到外焕然一新。农村里建起了很多新的，光线充足的住宅，变得日益美丽。
    社会主义的保加利亚在国民教育、卫生保健、艺术、科学等方面的文化革命取得了极大的成就。整个思想战线都在马克思列宁主义理论的基础上发展着，和社会主义建设的实际任务、和生活的联系日益紧密。保加利亚作家、画家、作曲家的作品，我们的演员、歌手、音乐家的创作，任何时候也没有像现在这样受到读者、观众和全体人民的喜爱和关怀。他们从前任何时候也不可能像现在这样能够在国外频繁地演出。社会主义的保加利亚庆祝十五周年国庆的时候正是处于新的发展阶段的开始，正是处于为争取提前完成三年计划、争取实现经济大跃进的全民运动的高潮。
    根据第七次党代表大会的决议，并且鉴于所发掘出来的巨大可能性和潜力，党中央委员会和政府制订了1959—1962—1965年国家加速发展的计划。保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫在向国民议会作的报告中阐明了并论证了计划的主要内容。国民议会批准了这个计划，并使它成为法律。这个计划现在是全体保加利亚人民的伟大的建设纲领。这个计划的完成，将意味着生产力的巨大发展，从而大力扩大和加强社会主义的物质生产基础，日益走向逐步过渡到共产主义的阶段。这个计划规定到1962年要使工业生产量大约增加一倍，而到1965年则要比1957年增加两倍到三倍，即比1939年工业生产量增加二十四倍到二十九倍。计划规定在1965年要用保加利亚自己的生产来满足保加利亚对黑色金属、钢材需要量的一半以上。在1965年与1957年比较，机器和金属制品的生产要多四倍，硬煤的生产要多二倍，化学工业生产的产品要多六倍，而电力生产要达到一百亿度。
    这样，到1956年，工业产品按人口计算增加的情况如下：电力达到一千四百五十七度（1939年为四十二度），硬煤为五吨多（1939年为三百五十二公斤），钢为一百二十九公斤（1939年为零点九公斤），水泥为四百九十三公斤（1939年为三十六公斤），棉织品为四十九点二米（1939年为五点四米），糖为六十一公斤，植物油为二十五公斤等。
    平均年度的绝对增长额，到1965年规定要比1939年全部工业产品多一倍。
    到1965年，必需解决原料问题和生产丰裕的农产品的问题。农业生产到这个时期应该比1957年增加大约两倍到三倍。国民收入将增加两倍，实际工资将提高大约80％。这将会大大改善社会主义的劳动人民的物质和文化福利。
    任务是伟大的，也是艰巨的。但是它是可以实现的，它是保加利亚人民力所能及的。今年执行计划的结果实际上证明，这个任务是可以实现的。成绩是巨大的。工业产品在上半年比去年上半年增加了24％，零售贸易相应地增加了14.4％。农业方面也取得了极大的成绩。无庸置疑，加速经济发展的计划已经成为人民血肉相关的事，它一定会成功地完成。
    保加利亚人民怀着这种坚定不移的信心迎接自己的国庆十五周年。他们正以在精神上、政治上的团结一致和紧密地团结在自己亲爱的和久经考验的保加利亚共产党周围的行动，来迎接十五周年。因为他们的成绩首先要归功于这个党的英明领导。保加利亚共产党满怀信心地一贯领导着他们前进，向着新的、更加辉煌的胜利前进。保加利亚人民怀着深深感谢伟大的苏联及解放我们的苏联军队的心情，怀着珍视、加强和发展保苏的生气蓬勃的友谊的决心和意志，迎接自己最光辉的节日。保加利亚人民怀着同强大的中国人民、同所有社会主义国家的人民、同世界上一切爱好和平的人民兄弟般团结一致的心情，迎接十五周年。
