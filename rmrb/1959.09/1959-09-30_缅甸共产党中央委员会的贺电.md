Dear Comrades:

The great People's Republic of China, established under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, is now ten years old.

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all members of the Communist Party of Burma and the people of Burma extend our heartfelt congratulations and wish the Chinese people lasting peace and happiness.

Since the victory of the October Revolution, the first of its kind in human history, the founding of the People's Republic of China marks the second great victory of Marxism-Leninism. Due to the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the socialist camp emerged in the world. The birth of the People's Republic of China has changed the balance of power between the two camps, enabling the socialist camp to surpass the capitalist camp in strength. All people in the world who love peace, friendship, and happiness are delighted by this.

The founding of the People's Republic of China has particularly inspired the people of Southeast Asian countries. In the past, Asian countries were colonial markets for imperialists. Under these circumstances, the Chinese people drove out the imperialists and domestic reactionaries, established a free and independent country, and embarked on the road to socialism. Therefore, the founding of the People's Republic of China, like a beacon, illuminates the path for Asian countries to strive for freedom and independence.

Now, the People's Republic of China has leapt from a backward country to a modernized industrial power, which fully demonstrates that the people's democratic system is superior to the capitalist system. Despite all the slanders and defamations of the People's Republic of China by imperialists and reactionaries, news of the rapid development of China's economic construction continues to reach neighboring Burma. Whenever the Burmese people hear news of the Chinese people's victory, they feel as happy and excited as if they were hearing news of their own victory. At the same time, the Burmese people are also very envious of the achievements of the Chinese people, and they strongly demand to build Burma into a completely free and independent people's democratic country. However, after more than ten years of personal experience, the Burmese people have deeply realized that it is impossible to build Burma into a people's democratic country under the leadership of the bourgeoisie. Furthermore, they have also realized that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can a country be established that is independent, free, democratic, and economically prosperous. For this reason, the Burmese people are currently engaged in a heroic struggle under the banner of the Communist Party of Burma.

The current Burma is ruled by a military government headed by General Ne Win. When this government first came to power, it promised to adhere strictly to the neutral foreign policy, as it was under U Nu’s government. As long as they truly continue to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, our party will always support them, because these principles are beneficial to our country and nation. However, the military government not only borrowed 25 million US dollars from the United States, but also accepted 37 million US dollars in aid. With this US aid, the Rangoon-to-Mandalay highway, which has major military significance, was built in Burma. Under the guise of so-called arms sales, arms were imported into Burma at prices close to free. In addition, the military government also attended Southeast Asia military group military exercises as an observer. All of this, while not an outright participation in the Southeast Asia military group, shows that it has begun to gradually move towards this group.

In terms of domestic affairs, the military government continues to wage civil war, which was created by the imperialists and domestic reactionaries. They have also taken measures to restrict the activities and democratic rights of the people, and to suppress trade union organizations and opposition parties. The military government once stated that it could not hold general elections because of the existence of civil war. Now, although it has announced that general elections will be held in January and February 1960, under the conditions of no peace in the country, no restoration of democratic rights, and no legal status for the Communist Party of Burma and other democratic parties forced to go underground, such general elections are impossible to be fair and reasonable.

Our party has always insisted on and strived for the goal of restoring the people's democratic rights, restoring the legal status and legal activities rights of the Communist Party of Burma and other political parties, stopping the civil war through negotiations, and restoring domestic peace. However, the military government, disregarding the Burmese people's desire for peace and the legitimate proposals of the Communist Party of Burma, continues to wage civil war with the assistance of US money, weapons, and other military supplies, thereby making the domestic situation still very bad. This is certainly not a permanent phenomenon, but a temporary one, the darkness before dawn. The Communist Party of Burma and the Burmese people are very clear about this. Not only that, but the Burmese people are also convinced that Burma must take the road of people's democracy, establish a completely free and independent country, and must be able to achieve victory on this road.

The People's Republic of China was born in struggle and hardship. Similarly, Burma will surely unite all forces that can be united, establish a broad and consolidated united front, and achieve victory in struggle and hardship.

Long live the People's Republic of China!

May the People's Republic of China be prosperous and strong!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the people!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people!

Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma

### 缅甸共产党中央委员会的贺电

专栏：

    缅甸共产党中央委员会的贺电亲爱的同志们：
    在中国共产党领导下建立起来的伟大的中华人民共和国现在已经十周年了。
    在这中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，缅甸共产党全体党员和缅甸人民，谨致以衷心的祝贺，祝贺中国人民的持久和平和幸福。
    自从人类历史上首创的十月革命胜利以来，中华人民共和国的成立，标志着马克思列宁主义的第二次伟大胜利。由于十月社会主义革命的胜利，世界上产生了社会主义阵营，而中华人民共和国的诞生，改变了两个阵营的力量对比，使社会主义阵营的力量超过了资本主义阵营。世界上所有爱好和平、友谊和幸福的人民，为此感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中华人民共和国的诞生，特别鼓舞了东南亚国家的人民。过去的亚洲国家，是帝国主义者的殖民市场。在这种情况下，中国人民赶走了帝国主义者和国内反动派，建立起自由独立的国家，走向社会主义的道路。因此中华人民共和国的成立，像灯塔一样，照亮了亚洲国家争取自由和独立的道路。
    现在，中华人民共和国已经从落后的国家跃进为现代化的工业国，这充分说明人民民主制度比资本主义制度更加优越。尽管帝国主义者和反动派对中华人民共和国进行了种种诬蔑和诽谤，但是中国经济建设获得迅速发展的消息，都不断传到近邻的缅甸来。缅甸人民每当听到中国人民胜利的消息时，正如听到自己的胜利消息一样，感到欢欣鼓舞。同时，缅甸人民也对中国人民的成就感到极大的羡慕，他们非常强烈地要求把缅甸建成完全自由独立的人民民主国家。但是，缅甸人民经过了十年多的亲身经历，深深地体会到：在资产阶级的领导下，要把缅甸建成为人民民主国家是不可能的。此外，他们还认识到，只有在共产党的领导下，才能建立一个独立、自由、民主和经济繁荣的国家。正因为如此，目前，缅甸人民在缅甸共产党的旗帜下，进行着英勇的斗争。
    目前的缅甸，是由以奈温将军为首的军政府统治着的。这个政府刚上台时，曾经答应像吴努政府执政时那样，严守中立的外交政策。只要他们真正继续执行和平共处的五项原则，我们党将永远给予支持，因为这种原则有利于我们的国家和民族。但是，军政府不仅向美国贷款二千五百万美元，而且还接受了三千七百万美元的援助。利用这些美援，在缅甸修筑了具有军事上重大意义的仰光到曼德勒的公路线。在所谓军火买卖的形式下，还以近似于赠送的价格，把军火输入缅甸。此外，军政府还以观察员的身份，出席东南亚军事集团的军事演习。所有这些，虽然还不是公然参加东南亚军事集团，但说明已开始逐步趋向于这个集团。
    在内政方面，军政府继续进行内战，而这个内战是由帝国主义者和国内反动派一手制造起来的。他们还采取措施限制人民群众的活动和民主权利，镇压工会组织和反对党派。军政府曾经借口内战的存在，表示不能举行大选。现在虽然宣布1960年1、2月间举行大选，而在国内没有和平、民主权利没有恢复、缅共及其他被迫转入地下的民主党派没有取得合法地位的条件下，这种大选是不可能公平合理的。
    我们党一贯坚持并且为这样的目标而努力：恢复人民的民主权利、恢复缅共及其他政党的合法地位和合法活动权利，通过谈判停止内战，恢复国内和平。但是，军政府却不顾缅甸人民的和平愿望和缅甸共产党的合法建议，依靠美国的金钱、武器和其他军用物资的援助，继续进行内战，因而使国内局势仍然非常恶化。这当然不是永久的现象，而是暂时的现象，是黎明前的黑暗。关于这点，缅甸共产党和缅甸人民都很清楚。不仅如此，缅甸人民还坚信，缅甸必须走人民民主的道路，建立一个完全自由、独立的国家，而且一定能够在这条道路上，取得胜利。
    中华人民共和国是在斗争和困难中诞生的。同样的，缅甸也必定会团结一切可以团结的力量，建立广泛和巩固的统一战线，在斗争和困难中取得胜利。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    祝中华人民共和国繁荣富强！
    中国共产党和人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中缅两国人民的友谊万岁！
                      缅甸共产党中央委员会
                                  1959年9月1日
