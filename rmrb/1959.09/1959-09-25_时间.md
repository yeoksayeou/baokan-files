Time
柯灵

Some friends were chatting casually and mentioned a common feeling: Before liberation, in those years of anxiously awaiting dawn, time seemed particularly slow; after liberation, the days passed extremely quickly, as if in the blink of an eye, it had already been ten years.

Of course, throughout history, Father Time has always moved at the same pace, but the meaning and value of time are different, and the feeling people have towards it is different. This is a fact, not an illusion.

In these ten years, how much ground have we covered? Our country has moved from a semi-feudal, semi-colonial backward state to a vibrant socialist construction; our people have completely shaken off the fate of being enslaved and exploited, shaken off hunger, disease, and disaster, shaken off the sloppiness, ignorance, and selfishness—all the physical and spiritual shackles imposed by the old system on people, and have begun to create their new life with an indomitable spirit. … Such an evolutionary process, under normal circumstances, would take decades, perhaps centuries, but we have completed it in ten years.

Today, if an ordinary Chinese person has lived to be sixty years old, their life will contain countless heavy and bitter memories. They have lived through several dynasties, suffered all kinds of dark rule, and experienced continuous wars—world wars, the flames of war ignited by invaders on our land, reactionary civil wars, as well as people's uprisings and revolutionary wars. They have seen many bizarre and grotesque aspects of the world. But counting carefully from the beginning of their sixty years, the previous fifty years can only be regarded as having been wasted. Their life began at the age of fifty-one.

In these ten years, we have done many things, and our work has been very intense. We cleaned up the mess, recuperated and rehabilitated, built factories on empty land, built houses on ruins, opened oil fields in the Gobi Desert, and built cities in forests; we made steel, built machines, mined, built reservoirs, made tractors, planted forests, reclaimed wasteland, and improved the soil; we eliminated illiteracy and eradicated the "seven pests"; we built libraries, laboratories, theaters, and cinemas, and for safety, we also had to build some airplanes, warships, and cannons… An eighty-year-old Soviet worker, speaking at an All-Soviet Peace Supporters Congress, said a simple, clear, and moving sentence: "We have no time to fight!"—Yes, we have no time! But we are well aware of the sinister intentions of the warmongers.

In a limited number of years, we have traveled many roads and done many things, which has greatly changed people's perception of time: it seems to have grown wings, carrying a whooshing sound, carrying thunder and lightning, and carrying people forward with a roar.

There is also a psychological reason. In the old society, life was a painful journey, and the future of the country, personal ideals, careers, and love were all like looking at flowers in the fog or trying to catch the moon in the water, an endless pursuit, disillusionment, and depression. It was a stagnant pool of life, with no hope and no way out. But now, the land of the motherland has awakened, filled with a fresh atmosphere everywhere, and people's lives have clear goals, which are so solemn and beautiful. The heavy psychological burden has been removed, self-confidence and a sense of pride have been generated, and everyone has heard the call of youth in their hearts and felt the strong rhythm of life's growth.

Advanced people are not satisfied with this speed and demand to go faster. Since last year, countless miracles have emerged one after another, and many things that were previously considered impossible have been accomplished. Industrial products have increased tenfold or dozens of times, and production targets are like a volley of crossbows, striving to move upward; crops have had unprecedented bumper harvests. At the sound of "Great Leap Forward in steelmaking," blazing furnaces appeared on the vast and boundless fields, vying with the stars in the sky at night. People's communes, like giants in mythology, suddenly appeared on the ground. Tens of thousands of folk songs sing of our glorious era, our people's soaring energy, and heroic spirit.

We call this the Great Leap Forward. This is the result of the shining of the General Line because the General Line embodies the people's demands and embodies the people's diligence, wisdom, creativity, and enthusiasm.

This leap forward has angered the imperialists. The reason is easy to understand: our rapid growth violates their wishes and violates the interests of colonialism. From their point of view, it would be best if we took a Great Leap Backward—back to before 1949. But this is, of course, a foolish dream. Everyone knows their inglorious deeds in China in the past. Just ten years ago, when the Chinese people had just been liberated, it was the United States, with Wall Street as its backstage boss, that published Acheson's "White Paper," undisguisedly declaring their hostility towards the new China, and admitting that they had always been the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. As for Britain, this old imperialist, we can turn the pages of history even further back—perhaps it is a coincidence? Exactly one hundred years ago, when the British fleet encountered resistance in its armed attack on the Baihe River Estuary of our country, the British "Daily Telegraph" angrily published such a comment: "Terrorist measures should be implemented no matter what, and there can be no more leniency! … The Chinese should be taught to value the English, that the English are superior to the Chinese, and that the English should become the masters of the Chinese… We should at least seize Beijing, and if a more courageous policy is adopted, we should permanently occupy Guangzhou after seizing Beijing." (Quoted from Marx's "New War Against China," see "Marx and Engels on China.")

For imperialists, this is, of course, an "unbearable memory."

"Even the spiderwebs and fallen flowers outside the eaves want to keep spring from leaving."--The good days of capitalism are over, but their minds have not turned around (and it is simply impossible for them to turn around). What they dream of is still opium and slave trading, still gradual encroachment, still some "power politics" and "world hegemony." But--"The imperialist wolves should remember that the era when they arbitrarily manipulated the fate of mankind and arbitrarily slaughtered Asian and African countries is long gone!"

Now that we have seen the great ideals, seen the heights that our efforts can achieve, and seen that our constant progress not only means the increasing prosperity of our motherland but also means the increasing dominance of the world's forces of peace over the forces of war, of justice over evil, then we should naturally make every precious minute play its full value and connect victories one after another, never leaving any gaps.

The Soviet man-made earth satellite can fly 480 kilometers in one minute, reaching the first cosmic speed. But in order to send rockets into space and carry out magical space travel, it is necessary to increase it to more than 671 kilometers per minute, reaching the second cosmic speed. Now the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket has been sent to the moon. --This is our glorious example!

When I mention the word "we," I say it with feelings full of pride and confidence because it represents our powerful people, the people who are closely united around the Communist Party, the highly conscious and inviolable people, the intelligent, diligent, and brave people! It is closely linked to the socialist family and linked to the proletariat and honest and kind people all over the world.

We are invincible!

"Time is gold" is not entirely true, because it depends on who it is said to. The time of spring makes all things flourish, while in winter, every minute promotes aging. It is we who possess the youth of the century, and history will prove that this is the beginning of permanent youth. We have clearly seen this omen. We will also stand the test of time, full of vigor and vitality, and laugh at the death of imperialism.

Ten years have passed. In the long river of time, this is just a moment in the infinite length, but in human history, this is truly a chapter worthy of greatness and magnificence!

Let us sing to our heart's content with the greatest enthusiasm and take over this glorious torch and continue to move forward!

专栏：十年颂歌

    几个朋友偶然闲谈，谈到了一个共同的感觉：在解放前，那些焦急地等待天亮的年月里，时间似乎特别慢；解放以后，日子却过得快极了，仿佛一霎眼间，就已经是十年。
  当然，古往今来，时间老人迈的永远是同样的步子，但是时间的意义和价值不同，对人的感觉不同了，这是事实，而不是幻觉。
    在这十年里，我们走了多少路呢？我们的国家从半封建半殖民地的落后状态走到了轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设；我们的人民远远地摆脱了被奴役被剥削的命运，摆脱了饥寒、瘟疫、灾难，摆脱了散漫、愚昧、自私——旧制度所加于人们的一切肉体上和精神上的桎梏，开始以一往无前的豪迈气概，创造自己的新生活。……这样的演变过程，按照通常的情况，需要几十年，也许是几个世纪，而我们在十年里面完成了。
    在今天，一个普通的中国人，如果他已经活到六十岁，他的生命里就会有无数沉重和酸辛的记忆。活过几个朝代，受过各式各样的黑暗统治，经历过连绵不断的战争——世界大战，侵略者在我们国土上燃起的战火，反动的内战，也有人民的起义和革命战争。他看过许多陆离光怪的世态。但是六十生涯，从头细数，已往的半百之年，却只能算是掷于虚牝了，他的生命是从五十一岁开始的。
    在这十年里，我们做了很多事，我们的工作很紧张。我们收拾烂摊子、休养生息，在空地上盖厂房，在废墟上造住宅，在戈壁上开油田，在森林里建城市；我们炼钢、造机器、开矿、筑水库、造拖拉机、植林、垦荒、改良土壤；我们扫盲、除七害；我们建筑图书馆、实验室、戏院、电影院，为了安全，我们还不得不造些飞机、军舰和大炮……苏联有位八十高龄的老工人，在一次全苏和平拥护者代表大会上发言，说过一句简单明了而又动人肺腑的话：“我们没有功夫打仗！”——是的，我们没有功夫！但我们熟知战争贩子险恶的居心。
    在有限的岁月里，我们跑了许多路，做了许多事，这就使人对时间的感觉大大地改变了：它仿佛长了翅膀，带着呼呼的风声，挟着惊雷闪电，带着人们轰轰然前进。
    也还有一种心理上的原因。在旧社会，人生是一种痛苦的行旅，国家的前途，个人的理想、事业、爱情，事事如雾里看花，水中捞月，无穷无尽的追求、幻灭、苦闷。那是一池死水般的人生，没有希望，没有出路。而现在，祖国的大地苏醒了，到处充满清新的气息，人们的生活有了明确的目标，而且是如此庄严伟美。沉重的心理负担去掉了，自信心和自豪感产生了，每个人都在自己心里听到了青春的呼声，感到了生命成长的强烈的节奏。
    先进的人们不满于这种速度，要求走得更快些。从去年开始，无数的奇迹先后涌现，许多从来认为办不到的事情都办到了。工业品十倍几十倍地增长，生产指标如万弩齐发，争着向上挺进；庄稼有了史无前例的大丰收。一声“大炼钢铁”，广阔无边的原野上就出现了熊熊的炉火，入夜与满天的繁星争辉。人民公社像神话中的巨人，突然在地面出现。成千成万首的民歌，歌唱着我们辉煌的时代，我们人民的冲天干劲，豪情胜概。
    我们把这个叫做大跃进。这是总路线光辉照耀的结果，因为总路线体现了人民的要求，体现了人民的勤奋、睿智、创造性和积极性。
    这个跃进触怒了帝国主义者。理由是容易理解的：我们迅速的壮大违反他们的愿望，违反殖民主义的利益。从他们的立场看，最好是我们大跃退——退回到1949年以前去。但这当然是愚蠢的梦想。谁都知道他们过去在中国不光荣的行径。也不过是十年以前，当中国人民刚刚解放的时候，就是这个以华尔街为后台老板的美国，就发表过艾奇逊的“白皮书”，毫不掩饰地宣布过他们对新中国的敌意，承认他们从来就是中国人民的死敌。至于英国这个老大帝国主义，我们可以把历史更往回翻一点，——也许是巧合吧？正好距今一百年，当英国舰队向我国白河口武力进攻遭到抵抗的时候，英国的“每日电讯报”，曾经激怒地发表过这样的评论：“无论如何应该实行恐怖手段，再不能从容了！……应该教训华人重视英人，英人高出于华人之上，英人应成为华人底主人翁……。我们至少应该夺取北京，如果采取更勇敢的政策，则应于夺取北京以后永远占领广州。”（转引自马克思“新的对华战争”，见“马克思恩格斯论中国”。）
    对帝国主义者来说，这当然是“不堪回首”的事。
    “檐外蜘蛛网落花，也要留春住。”——资本主义的好日子过完了，但他们的脑筋还没有转过来，（也根本不可能转过来），他们所寤寐难忘的，还是鸦片和奴隶买卖，还是蚕食鲸吞，还是什么“实力政策”和“世界霸权”。但是——“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运，任意宰割亚非国家的时代，早已一去不复返了！”
    我们既然已经看到了伟大的理想，看到自己努力所能达到的高度，同时看到我们的不断前进，不仅意味着我们祖国的日益繁荣，并且意味着全世界和平力量对战争势力，正义事业对邪恶势力的优势的增长，那么，我们自然就应该使宝贵的每一分钟都发挥它充分的价值，使胜利和胜利一个一个地连接起来，永远也不要有空隙。
    苏联人造地球卫星一分钟能飞四百八十公里，达到了第一宇宙速度。但是，为了把火箭送入宇宙，实行神奇的宇宙旅行，还必须要求提高到一分钟六百七十一公里以上。达到第二宇宙速度。现在苏联第二个宇宙火箭已经送上了月球。——这是我们光辉的榜样！
    当我提到“我们”这个字眼的时候，我是用充满自豪与自信的感情来说的，因为它代表我们强大的人民，以共产党为核心而紧紧地团结在一起的人民，有高度自觉的、不可侵犯的人民，聪明、勤劳和勇敢的人民！它和社会主义大家庭紧紧地连系着，和全世界无产阶级、正直善良的人民联系着。
    我们是无敌的！
    “时间是黄金”，这个谚语不完全，因为要看它对谁而说。春天的时间使万物欣欣向荣，而在冬天，每一分钟都在促进衰老。占有世纪的青春的是我们，历史将会证明：这是永久的青春的发端，我们已经清清楚楚地看到了这种朕兆。我们也将在时间的考验之下，意气风发，笑看帝国主义的死亡。
    十年过去了，在时间的长河里，这只是无限绵长中的一瞬，但在人类史上，这却是真正无愧于伟大和瑰丽的一章！
    让我们以最大的热忱来尽情歌颂，并且接过这光荣的火炬，继续迈进！
