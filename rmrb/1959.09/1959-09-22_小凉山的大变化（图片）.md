Great Changes in Xiaoliangshan

    What sound is most terrifying?
    The slave owner's gunshot!
    What is most precious?
    Chairman Mao's kindness!

    What sound is most terrifying?
    The slave's painful moan!
    What is most precious?
    The slave has been reborn.

    This is a small poem, very short, but it reflects the earth-shaking changes in the Xiaoliangshan area of Yunnan Province.

    Not long ago, this place was still under the slave system, and nearly 30,000 slaves groaned under the whips and shackles of the slave owners.

    From 1957 to 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the slaves of Xiaoliangshan achieved democratic reforms, gained personal freedom, crossed several historical periods, and entered a new era of socialist construction. People's communes have been generally established here. In the Great Leap Forward last year, tens of thousands of mu of land were reclaimed, water conservancy projects were built, and the first harvest of their own grain was reaped. This year, they no longer rely on state relief for the food, agricultural tools, and clothing they need. They are moving forward to create a better life.

    Members of the Paomaping Commune happily sing and dance (top picture). Not long ago, people suffered the torment of slave owners' shackles.

    Before liberation, there were very few literate people in Xiaoliangshan. Now there are five primary schools, one middle school, and one cadre school. All students are admitted free of charge. This is a teacher from Erchun Primary School talking with a group of students.

    Members of the Hongqi Commune use rice transplanters to plant rice. Not long ago, this place was still in a primitive state of "slash-and-burn cultivation." The left picture shows the main agricultural tools they used before the democratic reform.

    Animal husbandry in Xiaoliangshan has developed rapidly. The picture shows a flock of sheep from the Shali Ping brigade of the Paomaping Commune.

    小凉山的大变化
    什么声音最惊心？
    奴隶主的枪声！
    什么东西最宝贵？
    毛主席的恩情！
    什么声音最惊心？
    奴隶痛苦的呻吟！
    什么东西最宝贵？
    奴隶得到了新生。
    这是一段小小的诗歌，很短，然而，它却反映了云南省小凉山地区翻天复地的巨变。
    不久以前，这里还处在奴隶制度，近三万奴隶呻吟在奴隶主的皮鞭和枷锁之下。
    1957年到1958年间，小凉山的奴隶们在党的领导下，实现了民主改革，获得了人身自由，跨越了几个历史时期，进入了社会主义建设的新时代。这里已普遍建立了人民公社，在去年大生产运动中，开垦了几万亩土地，兴修了水利工程，第一次收获了自己种的粮食。今年，他们自己所需要的口粮、农具和衣服已不再依靠国家的救济，他们正为创造更美好的生活前进。

    解放前，小凉山很少有识字的人，现在已经有五所小学、一所中学和一所干部学校。全部学生都免费入学。这是二村小学老师和一群学生谈话。
    红旗公社社员们使用栽秧机栽秧。不久以前这里还处在“刀耕火种”的原始状态，左图就是民主改革前他们使用的主要农具。
