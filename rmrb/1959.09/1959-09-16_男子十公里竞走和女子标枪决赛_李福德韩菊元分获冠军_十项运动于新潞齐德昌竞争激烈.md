Xinhua News Agency, September 15th - The athletics competition of the First National Games entered its third day on the 15th. In the two finals held today, Li Fude from Heilongjiang won the men's 10km (10,000m) race walk title with a time of 48 minutes 56.6 seconds. Han Juyuan from Beijing won the women's javelin title with a throw of 41.29 meters.

A total of 52 athletes participated in the 10km race walk final. Li Fude from Heilongjiang, who was not previously well-known, maintained a relatively fast pace throughout and outpaced all other athletes to finish first. The other seven athletes who achieved excellent rankings also finished within 50 minutes. During the women's javelin preliminary and final rounds, Zhou Jian from Shanghai and Tang Rongqing from Sichuan, who led in the "qualifying round" on the 14th, were too nervous and failed multiple throws, failing to make the top eight.

The men's decathlon competition began today with the first five events.

Qi Dechang from Shanghai, who set the national best score this year (5696 points), and Yu Xinlu from Beijing, the holder of last year's national record (5185 points), competed fiercely. At the end of the first three events—100m, long jump, and shot put—Qi Dechang had accumulated 1973 points, 66 points more than Yu Xinlu. However, in the fourth event, the high jump, Yu Xinlu cleared 1.82 meters, while Qi Dechang only cleared 1.76 meters. As a result, Yu Xinlu's score for the first four events (2701) exceeded Qi Dechang's (2695). After the fifth event, the 400m race (Yu's time was 53.2 seconds, Qi's was 53.6 seconds), Yu Xinlu's score increased to 3331 points, and Qi Dechang's was 3301 points. Both of their scores exceeded Qi Dechang's score for the first five events (3257 points) when he set the national best score this year. If they both achieve scores of 2366 points and 2395 points respectively in the last five events on the 16th, they will both be able to break the national best score.

    男子十公里竞走和女子标枪决赛
    李福德韩菊元分获冠军
    十项运动于新潞齐德昌竞争激烈
    据新华社15日讯　第一届全国运动会的田径比赛15日进入第三天。在今天举行的两项决赛中，黑龙江选手李福德以四十八分五十六秒六的成绩获得了男子十公里（一万米）竞走冠军。北京选手韩菊元以四十一米二九的成绩获得了女子标枪冠军。
    十公里竞走决赛共有五十二名选手参加。原来不大闻名的黑龙江选手李福德步伐始终保持比较快的频率，胜过了所有的选手第一个走完全程。其他七名获得优胜名次的选手，成绩也都在五十分钟以内。在举行女子标枪预赛和决赛时，14日在“及格赛”中成绩领先的上海周健、四川唐荣清由于太紧张，多次投扔失败，都没取上前八名。
    男子十项运动比赛今天开始举行前五项比赛。
    今年创造全国最高成绩（五六九六分）的上海选手齐德昌，同去年的全国纪录（五一八五分）保持者、北京的于新潞争夺十分激烈。在前三项——一百米、跳远、铅球比赛结束时，齐德昌的积分达到一九七三分，比于新潞多六十六分。但在举行第四项跳高比赛时，于新潞跳过了一米八十二，而齐德昌只跳过一米七十六，因而于新潞前四项的积分（二七○一）超过了齐德昌（二六九五）。当第五项四百米比赛（于的成绩是五十三秒二，齐是五十三秒六）结束后，于新潞的积分增加为三三三一分，齐德昌的是三三零一分。他俩的成绩都超过了齐德昌今年创造全国最高成绩时前五项的积分（三千二百五十七分），如果他两人16日在后五项比赛中成绩能分别达到二千三百六十六分和二千三百九十五分，就都能打破全国最高成绩。
