    First Paycheck
    [Uyghur] A·Mitisha Wuti
    Moonlight, like a clear spring, poured into Uncle Jielili's house through the skylight, illuminating the small room exceptionally brightly. The warm spring breeze teased the green willow branches outside the window, and the shadows of the willows flickered on the window, as if intentionally peeking into Uncle Jielili's secrets. The rustling sound seemed to gently ask through the window paper: Uncle Jielili, what are you thinking about?

    Uncle Jielili lay on the kang, unable to fall asleep no matter what. Because the commune had given him a paycheck of one hundred and ten yuan. This was a novelty for the old man in half his life, how could he not feel happy from the bottom of his heart?

    The rooster crowed. Uncle Jielili couldn't help but nudge Banlierhan and said softly, "Wake up!"
    "Old man, is it because you're so happy to receive your paycheck that you can't sleep?" It turned out that his wife, like him, was so happy that she hadn't closed her eyes all night.
    "That's right! Where should we spend this money?"
    "There are too many places to spend it, why are you worrying about it!"
    "Oh my, I mean, who has ever given us so much money since we were born? We should use it for proper things, we should be worthy of Chairman Mao who gave it to us."
    "What exactly do you want to do with the money?"
    "Listen," Uncle Jielili said slowly, "Our family lacks nothing. In the commune canteen, we can eat thin meat noodles and dumplings, new clothes shimmering with light are pressed in the box, layers of floral quilts are stacked in the cupboard, a flower-embroidered Hetian carpet is spread on the kang, and brand-new porcelain pots and bowls are placed on the table. I don't know what else we should buy?..." Before he finished speaking, Banlierhan interjected:
    "That's right! Before liberation, we worried about food and clothing all day long. Now it's turned upside down, we worry about not having a place to spend the money once we get it."

    Uncle Jielili ignored his wife's words, and he was lost in thought.

    In his youth, he and Banlierhan got married in a dilapidated house left by his parents. At that time, the landlord's rent and the government's taxes weighed him down so much that he couldn't even straighten his back, and he lived a life worse than cattle and horses all year round. Once, the head of the village urged him to pay, even wanting to take away his pot. He couldn't bear it anymore, picked up an axe and chopped at him. Unexpectedly, he didn't hit him, but was arrested and taken to the yamen to be imprisoned. After being detained for more than a month, the landlord Asimu·Hazi knew that he was a strong young man, so he bribed the prison officials and wanted him to work as a lifelong hired hand. Then, he forced him to sign the bond. From then on, Jielili and his wife Banlierhan became slaves of Hazi Bai, until the year of liberation...

    The window paper slowly turned into a snow-white sheet, and the sky was already bright. Uncle Jielili and Banlierhan couldn't wait to put on their clothes, walked through the shining fields, and headed towards the "bazaar".

    Today's "bazaar" was very lively, and the women dressed in red and green surrounded the department store. Various colorful fabrics and supplies were displayed on the counters. The restaurants were even more crowded, with waiters running in and out to serve the guests.

    The loudspeaker on the tree sounded, and a soprano voice said crisply: "Dear commune members! We congratulate you on receiving your first paycheck..." Uncle Jielili, wearing a new lined jacket, seemed to remember something when he heard this, and hurried towards the bank. Banlierhan felt strange and stared at him. The bank was packed with people, all holding red and green deposit books. Uncle Jielili squeezed to the front of the counter with great difficulty and handed over all one hundred and ten yuan to the teller.
    "Old man, how long do you want to deposit it for?"
    "Five years," the old man replied.
    Someone nearby said jokingly, "Deposit it for a year, you're so old!"
    "Go away!" Uncle Jielili glared at the man and said angrily, "Go do your own business, I still want to see communism with my own eyes!"

    第一次领工资
    〔维吾尔族〕阿·米提沙吾提
    月光像一条清亮的泉水，从天窗泻进节里力大爷住的屋子，照得这间小屋子分外明亮。春夜的暖风在窗外戏逗着青绿的柳条儿，窗户上柳影婆娑，像是有意窥探节里力大爷的秘密，那沙沙的响声又像贴着窗纸轻轻的问：节里力大爷，你在想些什么呀？
    节里力大爷躺在炕上，说什么也睡不着觉。因为，公社里发给了他一百一十元的工资。这是老汉半辈子碰到的新鲜事，他那能不打心底感到幸福呢？
    鸡叫了。节里力大爷忍不住推了班里尔汗一把，轻声的说：“你醒醒！”
    “老头子，是不是领到工资，高兴得睡不着？”原来老婆同他一样，也高兴得整夜没有合眼。
    “对呀！这些钱我们用到什么地方去？”
    “用的地方太多了，你还发什么愁！”
    “唉呀呀，我是说生下来谁给过我们这么多的钱呢？我们应当用到正经事上，应当对得起给我们的毛主席。”
    “你究竟要拿钱干什么呢？”
    “你听着，”节里力大爷慢腾腾的说：“我们这个家庭什么也不缺呀。在公社食堂里可以吃到细溜溜的肉面条、饺子，箱子里压着闪着亮光的新衣裙，壁橱里摆着一层层的花被子，炕上铺着绣花的和阗毯，桌子上摆着崭新的瓷壶瓷碗，我不知道我们还应该买些什么？……”他还没有讲完，班里尔汗就抢着说：
    “真是的！解放前整天为着吃穿发愁。现在却打了一个颠倒，钱到手发愁没处花。”
    节里力大爷没有理睬老婆的话，他痴呆呆的在想着心事。
    在他年轻的时候，和班里尔汗是在父母留下的一间破屋子里结婚的。那时候，地主的租子和官府的赋税压得他连腰也直不起，终年过着牛马不如的生活。有一次，甲长催款子竟要提走他的锅，他再也忍受不住了，拣起斧头就砍了过去。不料没有砍中，他却被抓到衙门里去坐牢。押了一个多月，地主阿西木·哈孜知道他是个身强力壮的小伙子，就向监狱官行了贿，要他作终生的长工。接着，又逼着他在字据上画了押。从那以后，节里力和他的妻子班里尔汗就变成了哈孜巴依的奴隶，直到解放的那年……
    窗纸慢慢的变成一片雪亮，天色已经大亮了。节里力大爷和班里尔汗迫不及待的穿好衣服，穿过闪光的田野，向“巴扎”走去。
    今天的“巴扎”非常热闹，打扮得红红绿绿的妇女们，把百货商店围得水泄不通。柜台上摆着各种五光十色的花布、用品。饭馆里的人更拥挤，招待员跑进跑出的招待客人们吃饭。
    安在树上的喇叭响起来了，一个女高音清脆的说道：“亲爱的公社社员们！我们祝贺各位第一次领到了工资……”穿着新夹袢的节里力大爷听到这儿，好像想起了什么事，连忙向银行走去。班里尔汗感到奇怪，瞪着眼睛瞅了他一眼。　　银行里的人挤得满满的，都拿着红红绿绿的存折。节里力大爷好容易挤到桌子跟前，把一百一十块钱如数的交给了营业员。
    “老大爷，你存多长时间？”
    “五年。”老汉回答说。
    旁边不知是谁说了句笑话：“存一年好了，这么大年纪！”
    “去你的吧！”节里力大爷瞪了那人一眼，忿忿的说：“快干你自己的事去吧，还要亲眼看看共产主义哩！”
