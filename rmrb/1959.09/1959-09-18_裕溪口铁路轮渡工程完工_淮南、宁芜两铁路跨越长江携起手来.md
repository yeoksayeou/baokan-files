Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: The newly built Wuhu-Yuxikou railway ferry project has been basically completed after more than a year of construction. From now on, the Huainan and Ningwu railways, which were separated by the Yangtze River, can be connected by ferry, allowing trains to cross the river, greatly shortening the railway transportation distance between the north and south of Anhui. In the past, most of the coal, limestone and other materials transported from northern Anhui to Wuhu and Ma'anshan areas in southern Anhui were transported via the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, taking the Ningwu Railway from Pukou. Now, it is only necessary to go from Bengbu via the Huainan Railway and cross the river at Yuxikou to reach Wuhu, which can shorten the transportation distance by one hundred and twenty kilometers. Bamboo, wood, and minerals abundant in southern Anhui can also be transported north from Wuhu by ferry.

Opening the Wuhu-Yuxikou ferry is one of the important measures taken by the Ministry of Railways to improve the throughput capacity of the north-south railway trunk line. Since the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, the southern section of the Jinpu Railway has been under heavy transportation burden. In particular, the transportation capacity of the Pukou-Nanjing ferry section has reached saturation. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways is accelerating the progress of the Tianjin-Shanghai railway double-tracking project and preparing to build the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, while simultaneously building the Wuhu-Yuxikou ferry project, diverting some of the freight cars passing through the Pukou-Nanjing ferry of the Jinpu Railway to the Huainan Railway and crossing the river via the Wuhu-Yuxikou ferry.

Construction of this ferry project began in August last year. After some line equipment was repaired and opened to traffic at the end of March this year, the ferry began operating. With the completion of the entire project, the ferry's throughput capacity will gradually increase.

### 裕溪口铁路轮渡工程完工  淮南、宁芜两铁路跨越长江携起手来

    裕溪口铁路轮渡工程完工
    淮南、宁芜两铁路跨越长江携起手来
    新华社合肥电  新建芜湖—裕溪口铁路轮渡工程，经过一年多施工，已经基本建成。从此，被长江隔断的淮南、宁芜铁路就可以通过轮渡连接起来，火车可以过江，大大缩短了安徽南北的铁路运输距离。过去由皖北运往皖南芜湖、马鞍山一带的煤炭、石灰石等物资，大部分经由津浦铁路南段，从浦口取道宁芜铁路。现在只要由蚌埠经淮南铁路在裕溪口过江便到芜湖，可以缩短运输距离一百二十公里。皖南盛产的竹木和矿石，也可以由芜湖渡江北运。
    开辟芜湖—裕溪口轮渡，是铁道部提高南北铁路干线通过能力的重要措施之一。全国工农业生产大跃进以来，津浦铁路南段的运输负担很重。特别是浦口—南京轮渡一段的运输能力已达到饱和的程度。因此，铁道部一面加速天津上海间铁路复线工程的进度，筹建南京长江大桥，一面修建芜湖—裕溪口轮渡工程，把经由津浦铁路浦口—南京轮渡过江的部分货车，改道淮南铁路经芜湖—裕溪口轮渡过江。
    这项轮渡工程从去年8月开始施工。今年3月末，部分线路设备修通以后，轮渡就开始通航。随着全部工程的完工，轮渡通过能力还将逐步提高。
