Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: Teachers and students at all levels of schools across the country have held meetings and symposiums in recent days, expressing their determination to do a good job in the new academic year, continue to implement the Party's education policy, improve teaching quality, and respond to the Party Central Committee's call to battle with practical actions.

    On the day the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were published, Tsinghua University in Beijing held a mass meeting. Jiang Nanxiang, Secretary of the Party Committee, called on teachers and students to go all out, run all departments and majors well, especially the newly established majors during the Great Leap Forward last year; speed up the construction of projects such as the comprehensive machinery factory currently under construction; and summarize the graduation designs so as to further improve the school's teaching, productive labor, and scientific research levels. Hu Xikui, Secretary of the Party Committee of Renmin University of China, put forward new leap forward tasks at the general assembly of teachers, students, and staff. He said: From this semester, Renmin University will implement a new academic system, with most undergraduate departments changing from the past four-year system to a five-year system, strengthening the education of the four Marxist-Leninist theory courses, and incorporating productive labor into the formal teaching plan. He also requested vigorous scientific research work, striving to complete ninety scientific research works within this year. Many universities in Beijing have formulated plans to improve teaching quality, carefully arranged students' production and labor in various majors, rectified school-run factories, and strengthened Marxist-Leninist political theory courses. All middle schools in Beijing have also held general assemblies of teachers and students; Dongcheng, Xicheng, Xuanwu, and other districts have generally held leap forward conferences for primary school teachers and staff. Teachers of Beijing No. 62 Middle School proposed: to go all out and earnestly achieve good lesson preparation, good lecturing, good homework correction, and good student tutoring. Constantly improve political and professional levels, and do everything possible to train students to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. All students in the school are also determined to listen carefully in class, review well after class, complete homework well, strictly abide by discipline, actively participate in labor, conscientiously exercise, and strive to be "three-good" students.

    In Shanghai, campuses of various schools are covered with big-character posters and slogans responding to the Party's call. At the conferences of teachers, students, and staff held in various universities, many professors, scholars, and young students over the age of sixty enthusiastically talked about their feelings, gains, and determination to respond to the Party's call during the Great Leap Forward. The teachers unanimously proposed: to continue to implement the Party's education policy and cultivate construction talents who are both red and expert for the country. Teachers and students of Fudan University, Jiaotong University, East China Normal University, and other universities are continuing to study the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in depth while formulating new academic year work plans for departments and teaching and research groups. Most of the teachers in the Marine Electrical Equipment Teaching and Research Group of the Electrical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University are young teachers. They guarantee to teach the nineteen courses offered in the new academic year and also strive to complete the electrical equipment design of the 15,000-ton coal transport ship in cooperation with the shipbuilding and other departments in mid-September. Last year, the teachers of the Geography Department of East China Normal University adhered to putting politics in command, earnestly implemented the Party's education policy, completed the comprehensive survey of the Yangtze River Delta entrusted by the state, and improved the teaching quality. They decided to continue this teaching method of combining theory with practice in the new academic year. After studying and discussing the communique and resolutions, many teachers and students of schools started immediately to intensify scientific research and prepare to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with outstanding achievements. Teachers and educational administrative cadres in primary and secondary schools in various districts of Shanghai have also gathered, and their enthusiasm is no less. Although most of the primary and secondary schools in the city have not officially started, the teachers generally expressed at the symposium: to make all preparations to welcome the new academic year.

    Teachers and students of universities in Jiangsu, Hubei, and other provinces enthusiastically stated that they would resolutely complete teaching, productive labor, and scientific research work to respond to the Party's call with practical actions. Professor Gao Jiyu, Vice President of Nanjing University, has not taught courses for many years. Now he has decided to offer organic synthesis courses for senior students in the Department of Chemistry in a short period of time. Associate Professor Cheng Kaijia of the Physics Department decided to further improve the teaching level of the two courses, quantum mechanics and solid state physics, this semester.

    Professor Zhang Bokang of the Department of Mathematics and Professor Cai Mingzhi of the Department of Physics of Jiangsu Normal College both believe that the faster the national construction, the more urgently construction cadres are needed; therefore, they resolutely stated that they would do a better job in teaching in the new academic year so that the middle school teachers they cultivate fully meet the national requirements. All teachers, students, and staff of Wuhan University held a mobilization meeting on August 28. Representatives of the departments of chemistry, economics, and biology put forward their action plans at the meeting. Many old professors also reported their leap forward plans with great interest. Professor He Dingjie of the Biology Department plans to complete the lecture notes for the two courses "Fundamentals of Genetics" and "Animal Genetics" before July 1960; recently wrote the book "Handbook of Wuhan Birds"; and will offer the course "Animal Breeding" before next spring.

    More than 60,000 graduates of this year's universities across the country have guaranteed to the school Party committees that they will immediately make achievements with the greatest enthusiasm after taking up their jobs and dedicate them to the great tenth anniversary of the National Day. More than 1,400 graduates of Tsinghua University in Beijing stated before leaving their alma mater that they would work hard as soon as they get to their jobs, and report to the Party with achievements made at the fastest speed.

    八中全会给广大师生增添了无限力量
    新学年要做出新成就
    据新华社3日讯　全国各地各级学校师生连日来纷纷举行大会和座谈会，表示决心做好新学年工作，继续贯彻党的教育方针，提高教学质量，用实际行动响应党中央的战斗号召。
    北京清华大学在党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布的当天，举行了群众大会。党委书记蒋南翔在会上号召师生们鼓足干劲，把各系各专业都办好，特别要办好去年大跃进中新建立的专业；加紧进行目前正在建设的综合机械厂等工程；作好毕业设计的总结，使全校的教学、生产劳动和科学研究水平再提高一步。中国人民大学党委书记胡锡奎在全校师生职工大会上提出了新的跃进任务。他说：人民大学从这学期起实行新的学制，本科多数系都将由过去的四年制改为五年制，加强四门马克思列宁主义理论的教育，把生产劳动列入正式的教学计划。他还要求大力开展科学研究工作，争取在今年内完成九十项科学研究著作。北京许多高等学校都已制订了提高教学质量的计划，细致地安排了各专业学生的生产、劳动，整顿了校办工厂，加强了马列主义政治理论课程等。北京市各中学也都召开全校师生大会；东城、西城、宣武等区普遍召开了全区小学教职员工的跃进大会。北京第六十二中学教师提出：要鼓足干劲，切实做到备课好、讲课好、批改作业好、辅导学生好。不断提高政治、业务水平，千方百计地把学生培养成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。全校学生也决心做到上课听讲好、课下复习好、作业完成好，严格遵守纪律，积极参加劳动，认真锻炼身体，争取做“三好”学生。
    上海市各学校的校园里到处贴着响应党的号召的大字报和标语。在各高等学校召开的师生员工大会上，许多年逾花甲的教授、学者、和青年学生，都热情洋溢地畅谈自己在大跃进中的感想、收获和响应党的号召的决心。教师们一致提出：要继续贯彻党的教育方针，为国家培养又红又专的建设人材。复旦大学、交通大学、华东师范大学等高等学校师生，一面继续深入学习中共八届八中全会公报和决议，一面制订系的和教研组的新学年工作计划。交通大学电机系船舶电气设备教研组大多数是青年教师，他们保证教好在新学年里开出的十九门课，还要争取在9月中旬完成他们和船舶制造等系合作的一万五千吨运煤船的电气设备设计工作。华东师范大学地理系教师去年坚持政治挂帅，认真贯彻党的教育方针，完成了国家委托的长江三角洲综合调查任务，又提高了教学质量。他们决定在新学年里继续坚持这种理论联系实际的教学方法。很多学校的教师、学生，在学习讨论公报和决议以后，说干就干，加紧科学研究，准备以出色的成绩迎接国庆十周年。上海市各区中小学教师和教育行政干部也都分别集会，他们的干劲毫不逊色。现在全市大部分中、小学还未正式开学，教师们在座谈会上普遍表示：要作好一切准备，迎接新学年。
    江苏、湖北等省各高等学校师生都热烈表示，坚决完成教学、生产劳动和科学研究工作，以实际行动响应党的号召。南京大学副校长高济宇教授已经多年不开课了，现在决定在短时期内为化学系高年级学生开有机合成课。物理系副教授程开甲决定在这学期进一步提高量子力学与固体物理两门课程的讲授水平。
    江苏师范学院数学系教授张伯康和物理系教授蔡铭之都认为，国家建设速度愈快，需要建设干部就愈迫切；因此他们坚决表示要在新学年更好地搞好教学工作，使培养的中学教师完全合乎国家要求。武汉大学全体师生员工在8月28日举行了誓师大会。化学、经济、生物等系的代表都在会上提出了自己的行动计划。许多老教授也兴致勃勃地报告了他们的跃进规划。生物系教授何定杰计划在1960年7月以前撰写完成“遗传学基础”、“动物遗传学”两门课程的讲稿；在最近写成“武汉鸟类手册”一书；并在明年春天前开出“动物育种学”课程。
    全国六万多名高等学校本届毕业生纷纷向学校党委保证，他们走上工作岗位后，立刻以最大的干劲作出成绩，向伟大的国庆十周年献礼。北京清华大学一千四百多名毕业生在离开母校前表示，一到工作岗位就大干特干，用最快的速度做出成绩向党汇报。（附图片）
