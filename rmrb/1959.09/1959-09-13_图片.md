To illustrate that Chinese maps of the Sino-Indian eastern sector boundary are drawn in accordance with what the British had acknowledged in the past, while the McMahon Line is indefensible, we publish the following maps:

    Right Picture: This is part of the "Tibet and Neighboring Countries" map published by the Survey of India in 1917. The Sino-Indian eastern sector boundary line shown on the map is still consistent with our maps, and not the McMahon Line. This shows that even three years after the British and Tibetan local authorities illegally demarcated the McMahon Line through secret exchanges, the British authorities still dared not publish the so-called McMahon Line.

    Left Bottom Picture: This is part of the "China" map on pages 68-69 of Volume 24 of the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica (1929). The boundary between northeastern India and the Kangzang region of China on the map is still drawn in accordance with Chinese published maps, and the so-called McMahon Line does not appear. It can be seen that fifteen years after the secret exchange of letters between Britain and Tibet illegally demarcated the McMahon Line, the British were still guilty and dared not change their consistent method of drawing the border.

    Right Bottom Picture: This is part of the "Political Map of India" published by the Survey of India in 1956. The boundary line between northeastern India and the Kangzang region of China shown on the map has been redrawn according to the McMahon Line. It is worth noting that the so-called McMahon Line appearing on this map penetrates deeper into Chinese territory in many places than the McMahon Line marked on the map attached to the 1914 Anglo-Tibetan secret exchange of letters.

    为了说明中国地图对中印东段边界的画法是英国过去所承认的，而麦克马洪线是见不得人的，我们发表以下地图：
    右图——这是1917年印度测量局出版的“西藏及邻国”图的一部分。图上所示中印东段边界线仍同我国地图一致，而不是麦克马洪线。这说明，在英国和西藏地方当局的代表以秘密换文非法划定麦克马洪线三年之后，英国当局还不敢公布所谓麦克马洪线。
    左下图——这是1929年大英百科全书（第十四版）第二十四卷第六十八至六十九页所载“中国”全图的一部分，图上印度东北部和中国康藏地区接壤的边界的画法仍然同中国出版的地图一致，并没有出现所谓麦克马洪线。可见，英、藏秘密换文非法划定麦克马洪线十五年之后，英国还是作贼心虚，不敢改变历来的画法。
    右下图——这是1956年印度测量局出版的“印度政治地图”的一部分。图上所标的印度东北部和中国康藏地区之间的边界线，已经根据麦克马洪线改画。值得注意的是，在这张图上出现的所谓麦克马洪线，在许多地方比1914年英藏秘密换文的附图所标明的麦克马洪线更加深入中国境内。
