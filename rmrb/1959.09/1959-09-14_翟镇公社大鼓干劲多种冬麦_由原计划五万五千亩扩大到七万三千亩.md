    Zhai Zhen Commune Exerts Great Effort to Plant More Winter Wheat
    Area Expanded from Original Plan of 55,000 Mu to 73,000 Mu
    (Our Dispatch) The Zhai Zhen Commune in Xintai County, Shandong Province, overcame right-leaning thoughts and mustered greater effort, expanding the area for autumn-sown wheat from the original plan of 55,000 mu to 73,000 mu. At the same time, production teams established mutual autumn-sowing collaboration contracts. Although the commune's area is expanded by 30,000 mu more than this year's actual wheat harvest, it can still guarantee the timely and high-quality completion of the wheat planting task before the Cold Dew solar term.
    Before communization, this area had only planted about 40,000 mu of wheat annually. Each year, some villages had to postpone wheat planting until after the "Frost's Descent" solar term due to insufficient labor and animal power. Therefore, this year, when the commune first proposed expanding the wheat planting area to 55,000 mu (an increase of 12,000 mu over this year's actual wheat harvest) and guaranteeing timely completion, some people lacked confidence. The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee illuminated the hearts of cadres and commune members and boosted everyone's revolutionary drive. After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, everyone unanimously agreed that the originally planned autumn planting was still conservative. The main reason was that the superiority of the "large-scale and public" people's commune had not been fully appreciated, and the problem was still being considered at the level of the small collective of the past agricultural cooperatives. Based on the opinions of the masses, the commune Party committee decided to expand the wheat planting area to 73,000 mu, reaching an average of 1.2 mu of wheat per person in the entire commune. At the same time, the labor and animal power situation in the commune was analyzed, and the farm work was specifically scheduled. The entire commune has 13,038 households, with more than 20,000 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers and 850 yokes of draft animals. If all the cattle are yoked, each yoke can plow an average of 2.5 mu of land per day. If another 5,000 laborers are drawn to dig the land, each person can dig an average of 0.5 mu per day. In this way, the entire commune can plow and dig a total of 4,500 mu of land per day. 40,000 mu of wheat fields are early-season crops. Calculated at 4,500 mu of plowing and digging per day, they can be plowed and planted in the ten days before the Autumn Equinox. The remaining 33,000 mu of soybean stubble land can be planted in just eight days after the soybeans are harvested after the Autumn Equinox, and all can be planted before the Cold Dew at the latest. However, looking at the situation of each production team, there are still many problems due to the different sizes of wheat planting areas and the amount of labor and animal power. On August 29, the commune Party committee convened a meeting of the secretaries of the general production brigades and production team branches, and unanimously decided to give full play to the superiority of the people's commune, carry out large-scale cooperation, and ensure the timely completion of the autumn planting task of 73,000 mu in the entire commune. On this basis, nine teams including Zhaijiazhuang and Yangcun, which had difficulties in planting wheat, signed cooperation contracts with twenty-three teams including Huangya based on the principle of equal value exchange.
    After the cooperation contracts were signed, a high tide of autumn plowing was set off throughout the commune. All the draft animals of each production team have been fully yoked. By August 30, 6,300 mu of land had been plowed and dug, with very good quality.

    翟镇公社大鼓干劲多种冬麦
    由原计划五万五千亩扩大到七万三千亩
    本报讯　山东新泰县翟镇公社破除右倾思想，鼓足更大干劲，使秋种小麦由原计划五万五千亩扩大为七万三千亩。同时，各生产队之间互相订立秋种协作合同，全社虽然比今年小麦实收面积扩大三万亩，仍可保证在寒露前适时地按质按量完成种麦任务。
    在公社化前，这里历年仅种小麦四万亩左右。每年有些村庄因劳力、畜力不足，种麦都要推到“霜降”后。因此，今年当公社第一次提出把小麦播种面积扩大到五万五千亩（比今年小麦实收面积扩大一万二千亩），并保证适时种完的要求时，有些人信心不足。党的八中全会的伟大号召，照亮了干部和社员的心，鼓舞了大家的革命干劲。大家学习了八中全会的决议之后，一致认为原订的秋种计划还是保守了，主要是没有把人民公社“一大二公”的优越性充分估计进去，还是停留在过去农业社小集体的水平上考虑问题。公社党委根据群众的意见，决定把种麦面积扩大到七万三千亩，达到全社每人平均一亩二分小麦。同时，分析了本社的劳力和畜力情况，对农活具体进行了排队。全社共一万三千零三十八户，有整半劳力二万多人，耕畜八百五十犋。耕牛上齐犋，每犋每天平均可耕地二亩半：再抽出五千劳力刨地，每人每天平均刨半亩，这样全社每天共可耕、刨地四千五百亩。麦田中有四万亩是早茬，以每天耕、刨地四千五百亩计算，秋分前十天就能耕好种完。其余三万三千亩豆茬地，秋分后割完豆子再动手，也只要八天时间就能种上，最迟寒露前可全部种完。但是从各生产队的情况来看，因种麦面积大小和劳力畜力多少不同，仍有不少问题。公社党委于8月29日召开了各生产大队、生产队支部书记会议，一致决定充分发挥人民公社的优越性，开展大协作，保证适时完成全社七万三千亩的秋种任务。在此基础上，翟家庄、羊村等九个种麦有困难的队与黄崖等二十三个队本着等价交换的原则，订立了协作合同。
    订立协作合同后，全社掀起了秋耕高潮，各生产队耕畜已全部上齐犋，到8月30日，已耕刨地六千三百亩，质量很好。
