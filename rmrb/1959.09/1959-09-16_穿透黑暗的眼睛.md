    Eyes That Pierce the Darkness
    Lu Ming

    Do you think that only sunlight, incandescent light, arc light... visible light, can give us light? No! With the help of infrared rays, even in the dark, our eyes can see everything.

    In 1800, the British physicist Herschel used a thermometer in front of a prism to study the heating power of the solar spectrum. Outside the red light in the red-orange-yellow-green-cyan-blue-violet visible spectrum, heat was also felt. Later, further research determined that there was invisible light outside the visible spectrum. The invisible light outside the violet light is called ultraviolet rays, and the invisible light outside the red light is called infrared rays.

    After infrared rays hit an object, the most obvious effect is the generation of heat, and all hot objects – as long as they are not at absolute zero, can radiate infrared rays. The wavelength of infrared rays is longer than the wavelength of all visible light, so it is as if it has a pair of convenient long legs that can bypass almost all obstacles on the road ahead, even heavy fog.

    Infrared rays, with their special characteristics and abilities, help us conquer darkness.

    In wartime, in order to avoid the sacrifices of air raids, all ports, stations, airports, and cities become deathly silent and dark. Lighthouses, buoys... all signal markers stop emitting light, which brings great difficulties to the safe driving of vehicles. But as long as the ship is equipped with an infrared searchlight—a general searchlight with an infrared filter that only allows infrared rays to pass through—and photoelectric tube receivers are installed on both sides of the ship, when the emitted infrared rays encounter an obstacle and are reflected back, the instrument pointer can tell us the direction of the obstacle.

    Isn't this the same as ordinary radar?

    Radio equipment like radar cannot make the target a visible image, but by using special methods, infrared rays can make the target a visible image.

    There is a special device called a "photoelectric converter" that can generate current from infrared rays, and then generate visible light from the current.

    When an enemy plane flies into our anti-aircraft artillery position, it does not encounter a beam of searchlight and may happily think that it can fly freely without worry. However, the most sensitive eyes on the ground - an infrared telescope equipped with a photoelectric converter - have already accepted the large amount of infrared rays radiated from its hot parts - the engine - and discovered it. In the telescope, it can be clearly seen what kind of aircraft this is. If a car or train driver wears this kind of telescope on their head, they can of course travel unhindered in the dark. There is also a type of base plate coated with a special phosphor, which can directly emit a faint green light when infrared rays hit it, and thus the image of the object is displayed.

    Infrared instruments are also widely used in industry and medicine. Infrared instruments can be used to directly observe the temperature conditions inside and on the surface of various hot containers in industry without measurement; they can be used to check the differences in human surface temperature directly related to health; and they can also be used to observe where the heat is being lost from a building. All of these are because objects radiate different intensities of infrared rays due to different temperatures.

    The young infrared detection technology is much superior to radio technology, and its future is limitless.

    穿透黑暗的眼睛
    路明
    你以为，只有那太阳光，白炽光，电弧光……等可见光，才能给予我们光明吗？不！由于红外线的帮助，即使在黑暗里，我们的眼睛也能看到一切。
    1800年，英国物理学家赫舍尔，在三棱镜前用温度计来研究太阳光谱的发热的能力。在红橙黄绿青蓝紫可见光谱中红色光的外边，也感觉到了热的存在。后来，进一步的研究确定了，在可见光谱以外，还有不可见光存在，在紫光外边的不可见光就叫紫外线，在红光外边的不可见光就叫红外线。
    红外线射到物体上以后，最明显的效果是产生热，而一切热的物体——只要它不是绝对零度，又都能辐射出红外线。红外线的波长比一切可见光的波长都长，所以就好像它长有一条方便的长腿一样，在前进的道路上，几乎能绕过一切障碍，即使是重雾也能穿过。
    红外线，就是以它的特殊的性格和本领，帮助我们战胜了黑暗。
    在战争中，为了避免空袭的牺牲，一切港口、车站、机场和城市，都会变得死一般的沉寂和黑暗，灯塔，浮标……一切信号标记都停止发出光明，这就给交通工具的安全行驶带来莫大的困难。但是只要在舰头上装着红外线探照灯——加了红外线滤光镜，只让红外线通过的一般探照灯，在舰的两侧装有光电管接收器，当射出去的红外线遇到障碍反射回来时，仪表的指针就能告诉我们障碍物的方向。
    这不和一般的雷达一样吗？
    雷达之类的无线电装置，不能使目标变成可见的形象，但是，采用特殊的方法以后，红外线却能使目标变成可见的形象。
    有一种“光电变换器”的特殊装置，能够使红外线产生电流，再由电流产生可见光。
    当敌人的飞机飞进我们的高射炮阵地时，它没有遇到一束探照灯光，也许它会高兴地认为可以自由飞行而用不着担心了，可是，地面上一双最敏锐的眼睛——装有光电变换器的红外线望远镜，早已接受了从它的发热的部分——发动机辐射来的大量红外线而发现了它。在望远镜里清楚的看到了这是一架什么样的飞机。如果汽车或火车的司机把这种望远镜戴在头上那当然可以在黑夜里畅行无阻了。还有一种涂有特种磷的底板，只要红外线射上去，就能直接发出绿色的微光，于是，物体的形象也就显示出来了。
    红外线仪器在工业上，医疗上的用途也很广泛。利用红外线仪器可以不用测量而直接观察到工业上各种热的容器内部和表面的温度情况；可以检查出直接有关健康的人体表面温度的差异；也可以观察到一幢房子的热量是从哪里散失掉的。所有这些，都是因为物体由于温度不同，辐射出的红外线强度也不同的缘故。
    年轻的红外线探测技术，比起无线电来要优越得多，它的前途是无量的。
