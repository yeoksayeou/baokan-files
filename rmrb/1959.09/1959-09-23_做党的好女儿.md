I, These Ten Years

    Being a Good Daughter of the Party
    Luo Shufang, Deputy Director of Jinan Renfeng Textile and Dyeing Factory

    Ten years is not a very long time, yet our great motherland and I have undergone such tremendous changes! In the past ten years, our poor and backward China, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, has made brilliant achievements in industry, agriculture, scientific research, and other fields. As for myself, I have also transformed from an illiterate and ignorant ordinary female worker into a deputy director.

    I was born into a poor urban family. My father pulled rickshaws for others all day long, and my mother washed clothes and did needlework for others. When I was seven years old, I was sent to a small handicraft factory to work as a thread spooler. At that time, I saw some children going to school with their satchels every day, and I was very envious. I asked my mother:
  “When will I go to school?” To my surprise, my mother replied with tears in her eyes: "Child, we poor people don't have that blessing!" Yes, at that time, our family couldn't even make ends meet, how could we afford to send our child to school! Later, I was sent to Renfeng Yarn Factory to work as a textile worker. The workers at that time were treated worse than animals. The foreman would beat us if he wanted to, scold us if he wanted to, and fire us at any time! After liberation, we workers were emancipated.

    Because I had made some achievements in my work, the Party gave me great honor and encouragement. I went to Beijing three times. The first time was in 1950 to attend the National Congress of Heroes and Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. At that meeting, I met Chairman Mao and shook his hand. When I saw Chairman Mao's great and kind face, I was extremely excited, and I said to myself: "Chairman Mao, it is you, it is the Party, that has brought us such happy days today!"

    After the democratic reform in 1951, I was elected as a team leader by my fellow workers. At that time, there were many difficulties in the work because the raw materials were not good; but when I thought of the education of the great Party and Chairman Mao, I strengthened my confidence, united all the workers in the team, overcame difficulties, and completed the production task. Our team won the glorious title of advanced team. In 1952, the leadership promoted me to workshop director. I was both happy and ashamed. On the one hand, I was grateful to the Party for its trust in me, and on the other hand, I was afraid that the burden was too heavy for me to bear. Due to the many difficulties encountered in specific work, especially many technical difficulties, I felt the urgent need to study. After I made this request, the Party sent me to the Qingdao Textile Cadre School to train me. I had hoped to study since I was a child, and I didn't get this opportunity until I grew up to be a big girl in my twenties. How happy I was!

    The one-year study period was divided into three stages. The first stage was to make up for general cultural knowledge. During this period, I could still keep up with the class. In the second stage, the lessons became more in-depth. I had never even heard of geometry, algebra, or chemical cotton spinning, so of course, I found it difficult to learn, and I always failed the exams. I was extremely sad: Wasn't this letting down the Party's cultivation of me? However, I must not retreat, I must catch up. When others were resting, I still reviewed my lessons. The teachers and students also did their best to help me and patiently explained various problems to me. Finally, I caught up. At the time of graduation, I was rated as a second-class excellent student and received a certificate and prizes.

    After studying, it was much easier to work. In the past, when a machine broke down, I could only stare blankly and worry. Now, although I can't repair it myself, I can check out the general problems on the machine.

    In 1956, I became the deputy director, specializing in employee welfare work. In the old society, who cared about the welfare of the workers? Today, the Party has sent cadres specifically to manage this matter. In the past few years, we have built new worker dormitories, primary schools and nurseries for worker children, expanded the health center, and set up wards. The lives of the workers are getting better and better every day. The workers are determined to repay the Party's kindness with production achievements and are working hard day and night. Compared with 1949, production increased by 118.8% in 1958. Now everyone is working even harder, preparing to make even greater achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, I deeply feel that we Chinese workers have stood up under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. I will never let down the Party's cultivation of me, always listen to the Party, and be a good daughter of the Party.

### 做党的好女儿

    做党的好女儿
    济南仁丰纺织染厂副厂长　骆淑芳
    十年，时间并不太长，然而我们伟大的祖国和我自己，都起了多么巨大的变化啊！十年来，我们这一穷二白的落后的中国，在党和毛主席的领导下，在工业、农业、科学研究事业等方面取得了辉煌的成就；而我自己，也从一个目不识丁什么也不懂的普通女工变成了副厂长。
    我出生在一个贫穷的市民家里。父亲整天在外边给别人拉套子，母亲给别人洗衣服和接些针线活做。我七岁时就被送进一个小手工业工厂去做打线工。那时我看到一些孩子天天背着书包上学校，心里很羡慕，就去问妈妈：
  “我哪天才上学呢？”想不到妈妈却含着泪回答我说：“孩子，咱们穷人没有那福气啊！”是的，当时我们一家人衣食都没着落，那里还能让孩子念书呢！后来，我又被送到仁丰纱厂做纺织女工。当时的工人真是牛马不如，工头说打就打，说骂说骂，动不动就被开除了！解放了，我们工人才翻了身。
    因为我在工作上做出了一点成绩，党给了我极大的荣誉和鼓励。我曾三次上北京。第一次是1950年出席全国工农兵英雄模范代表大会。在那次会上，我见到了毛主席，跟他老人家握了手。当我看到毛主席那伟大慈祥的面容时，我激动极了，心里直说：“毛主席，是您，是党，带给了我们今天这样幸福的日子啊！”
    1951年民主改革以后，我被工人同志们选为组长。当时，因为原料不好，工作中困难很大；但是当我想到伟大的党和毛主席的教育的时候，我增强了信心，团结全组工人，克服困难，完成了生产任务。我们小组获得了先进小组的光荣称号。1952年领导上提拔我当了车间主任。我又高兴又惭愧。一方面感谢党对我的信任，另一方面又怕担子重了担不起来。由于在具体工作中碰到不少困难，特别是碰到很多技术上的困难，使我感觉到迫切需要学习。在我提出这个要求后，党为了培养我，就送我到青岛去上纺织干部学校。从小就希望读书的我，在长成一个二十几岁的大姑娘以后，才得到了这个机会，我是多么高兴啊！
    一年的学习时间分成三个阶段。第一阶段是补习普通文化。这期间我还跟得上班。第二阶段学的功课深了，什么几何啊，代数啊，化学棉纺啊，我连听都没听过，学起来当然感到吃力，考试的时候老是不及格。我难过极了：这不辜负了党对我的培养吗？但是，我决不能退缩，一定要赶上去。别人休息的时候，我仍旧复习功课。老师和同学也尽力帮助我，耐心给我讲解各种问题。终于我赶上去了。毕业的时候，我被评为二等优秀学员，得到了奖状和奖品。
    经过学习以后，工作起来方便多了。过去机器发生故障以后只能白瞪眼干着急。现在虽然不能自己修理，但机器上的一般毛病可以检查出来了。
    1956年，我当了副厂长，专管职工生活福利工作。旧社会，工人的生活福利有谁过问？今天，党却派出干部专门管理这件事情。几年来，我们新建了工人宿舍、工人子弟小学和托儿所，扩大了卫生所，还设了病房。工人们的生活一天天愈来愈好了。工人们一心要用生产成绩来答谢党的恩情，夜以继日地辛勤地劳动着。1958年和1949年相比，增产了118.8％。现在大家正加倍努力地工作着，准备作出更大的成绩来迎接建国十周年。
    想想过去，比比现在，我深深感到我们中国工人，在党和毛主席的领导下，已经站起来了。我决不辜负党对我的培养，永远听党的话，做党的好女儿。
