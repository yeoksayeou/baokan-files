Revolutionary steadfastness is a very precious quality of our proletarian party. In the years of revolutionary war in the past, we needed revolutionary steadfastness and needed to highly promote this noble quality. In the current era of revolutionary construction, we need revolutionary steadfastness even more to make this noble quality shine brightly.

Revolutionary steadfastness and revolutionary thoroughness are closely related. It is impossible to have revolutionary steadfastness if one cannot recognize the lofty and great goal of the revolution, or see the bright and promising future of the revolution. Similarly, if one only has a yearning for the revolution and a goal, but does not use revolutionary steadfastness and an indomitable spirit to achieve it, then no matter how lofty and great the goal is, it cannot be achieved. This is like climbing a mountain: when you have chosen the highest peak and the path to climb up, you need unwavering determination and indomitable courage. Only in this way will you not be daunted by the bumpy roads along the way, you will not shake your head and sigh between cliffs, and you will not be blocked by the dense thorns. You will move forward without hesitation and unwaveringly, climbing to that glorious highest peak. Therefore, the more thorough the revolutionary goal, the more revolutionary steadfastness is needed. The reason why Communists are always full of confidence in their revolutionary cause, never pessimistic, and never waver is, on the one hand, because the cause we are engaged in is to realize communism, which is the most sublime ideal of mankind and the greatest and most glorious goal of the revolution. But on the other hand, it is also because we clearly recognize the inevitable laws of historical development, and this goal can definitely be achieved as long as we make unswerving efforts.

Thinking back to before our revolutionary victory, how many Communist Party members and revolutionaries risked dangers, ran around, and went through thick and thin for their great ideals and firm beliefs. They did not care about fame or fortune, nor did they seek enjoyment; they were not afraid of imprisonment or execution; they were not afraid of family separation or ruin. The only thing they thought about was how to save our nation from peril, how to overthrow the evil old society of oppression and exploitation, and how to build a communist society in such a country, so that the people of the whole country and our children and grandchildren could live a happy life. They paid countless prices for this glorious revolutionary cause, even their own precious lives. And when they paid any price, they were still filled with revolutionary optimism and showed unwavering revolutionary steadfastness. The "Collection of Poems by Revolutionary Martyrs" contains four lines of poetry by Comrade Xia Minghan before his execution:

"It doesn't matter if my head is chopped off, as long as my principles are true.
Even if you kill Xia Minghan, there will be successors."

These four lines of poetry fully express a Communist Party member's, a revolutionary's, incomparably firm belief in the revolution. For an individual, the head does not matter, and life is not worth cherishing, as long as you are a true communist, you are fearless. For the entire revolution, the death of a revolutionary is of course a loss, but it doesn't matter, because communism is the truth, it is inevitable for the law of historical development, and when one person falls, thousands upon thousands of successors will stand up and continue to fight bravely, and the revolution will eventually triumph. There are countless comrades like Martyr Xia Minghan in our revolutionary ranks. It was only because of these many unyielding and fearless people that the Chinese revolution achieved a glorious victory.

These steadfast people are like rocks standing tall in the world. They (igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, or metamorphic rocks) were born in "deep water and scorching fire," and after being tempered by floods and fierce fire, they developed strong bones, so they are particularly resistant to the blows of storms and rains. Now when we think of these people's unwavering revolutionary spirit, we always feel a sense of "high mountains to be admired, great deeds to be followed," and we pay them our respects.

It has been ten years since the victory of our revolution. The three mountains that weighed on our heads—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—have been overthrown, the cruel bloody struggle has passed, and we are now engaged in socialist construction. But why do we still need revolutionary steadfastness at this time, and why do we need to emphasize it even more?

The reason is very clear. Although we have overthrown the three mountains, this is only the first step in our entire revolutionary journey, and there is still the next step—we are now in the transition period from capitalism to socialism. During the transition period, as Marx said, we must not only eliminate all systems of exploitation and end the history of thousands of years of man exploiting man, but also make a complete break with the various old ideas left over from the past. That is to say, we must wage a resolute and thorough struggle against the bourgeoisie in the economic, political, and ideological fields. Compared with the struggle of the New Democratic Revolution in the past, although this struggle is not a bloody war, it is a more profound, broader, and more lasting struggle. Although this struggle has now achieved a basic victory with the basic completion of the transformation of the old socio-economic system in our country and the major gains of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle in 1957, the habitual forces of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie have not been completely overcome, and the remnant ideological and political activities of the bourgeoisie still exist. Therefore, our ideological and political struggle with the bourgeoisie is still going on in waves, rising and falling. What we must pay special attention to is that, due to the profound, extensive, and lasting nature of this struggle, it cannot but be reflected in our ranks. There are a few people in our revolutionary ranks who are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. Even if they resolutely resisted imperialism and feudalism and vaguely believed in socialism, if they do not thoroughly transform their thinking, are not fully prepared spiritually for socialist construction, and lack revolutionary steadfastness in the proletarian cause, then they will not be able to draw a clear line between bourgeois revolutionaries and proletarian revolutionaries. They will waver when they encounter a little risk in socialist construction, and will eventually become agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party, and the revolution cannot but be directed at their own heads. The rightists and some right-leaning opportunists in our Party are like this. Therefore, when the socialist revolution has not been completely completed and our ideological and political struggle with the bourgeoisie has not been completely extinguished, we still extremely need revolutionary steadfastness, and we need to emphasize revolutionary steadfastness even more.

In terms of socialist construction, it is naturally not a matter of a day or two to build a prosperous country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in our "poor and blank" country, but we must strive for the fastest possible speed, because this is not only the strong desire of the Chinese people, but also the fact that it is entirely possible. Since this is the case, there will inevitably be many difficulties and a certain degree of tension in the entire construction process. What's more, imperialism and its lackeys are still eyeing us, waiting for an opportunity to sabotage; what's more, the bourgeois ideas remaining in people's minds and the frequently occurring right-leaning conservative ideas are still becoming obstacles to our progress; what's more, in the process of fighting against nature, due to our insufficient understanding of it, we often have ideas and emotions of fear of difficulties. Therefore, in such a complex and arduous construction path, we must fight against the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, fight against right-leaning conservative ideas, fight against ignorance and laziness, fight against time,... To achieve a comprehensive and thorough victory in the revolution, we cannot do without indomitable revolutionary steadfastness!

Naturally, the era of construction is different from the era of war in the past. In the past, under the cruel destruction and oppression of counter-revolutionary forces, revolutionaries had to be prepared to lose their heads, shed blood, and sacrifice their lives in order to persist in the revolutionary struggle. Now, generally speaking, we are still in a peaceful environment, and the dangers of the past no longer exist. However, in terms of the arduousness of the revolutionary cause and its demands on revolutionaries, there is actually no difference. Do they not all equally require us to be steadfast, despise difficulties, and contribute everything we have to the revolutionary cause at any time?

In the past few years alone, there have been countless people who have firmly dedicated themselves to the cause of socialist construction. Under the guidance of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, they are not afraid of difficulties, they are tireless; they dare to think and dare to act, and they are bold in creating; they have been fighting against those right-leaning conservatives, and they have always held high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward, and they are striding forward courageously. They never stop, they never care about personal gains and losses, and the only thing they long for is how to quickly change the "poor and blank" face of our country, and quickly build a highly developed socialist society in our country. Although their heroic actions are not about shedding their heads and sprinkling their blood, their loyalty to the revolutionary cause, their fearlessness of sacrifice, and their unwavering spirit towards the revolutionary goal are exactly the same. As for those who have contributed their precious lives for the revolutionary cause, such as Comrade Xiang Xiuli and others, there is no need to say more.

The opposite of revolutionary steadfastness is revolutionary wavering. In the history of the revolution, the more severe the days, the clearer this line is drawn. In the era of socialist construction, revolutionary wavering is of course not as direct as in the era of war in the past, but there are indeed some people who lack confidence in socialist construction and express doubt about whether a highly developed socialist society can be rapidly built in our country. This is mainly reflected in the insufficient recognition of the great significance of last year's Great Leap Forward and the establishment of people's communes. They are "steady and stable" theorists and cannot withstand a little tension; they treat the revolutionary mass movement with a bureaucratic attitude and seem unable to tolerate even a little deviation in the process of boldly mobilizing the masses. They also have a desire to engage in socialism, but they are unwilling to pay even a little price. They have always understood the general line from a right-leaning opportunist and right-leaning conservative point of view, believing that the proposal to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is contradictory, and doubting whether the people's communes have been messed up, and whether it is worthwhile to develop more heavy industry. They have exaggerated some temporary, partial, and already overcome or being overcome shortcomings in the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, and negated the great achievements we have made; when they encounter certain difficulties, they sigh and stop moving forward; they can close their eyes because they cannot temporarily buy a pound of pork or a bar of soap, and they cannot see the bright prospects of socialism. ... Of course, such people are a small part of the revolutionary ranks, but it can be seen from this how different they are from our comrades who are always full of vigor, full of energy, persevering, and advancing bravely! Of course, such people can still be educated and transformed to gain proletarian revolutionary steadfastness. If they are unwilling to do this, they will definitely be abandoned by the forward wheels of the socialist revolution and construction!

It can be seen from this how necessary and precious it is for a Communist Party member, or a revolutionary, to recognize and adhere to revolutionary thoroughness and revolutionary steadfastness in the period of socialist construction!

History has proven and will continue to prove that victory always belongs to the most steadfast. Lu Xun also said: "During the revolution, there are always people who retire, people who flee, people who become颓唐[TBD], and people who betray, but as long as it does not hinder the progress, the more it goes on, the more pure and elite this team becomes." The revolutionary train of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune will leave those who are weak-willed and wavering far behind; the strong revolutionary team will surely be able to victoriously reach the glorious and great destination. All those who waver, if they do not recognize the situation and quickly become firm, they will accomplish nothing and be pitiful and shameful. All those who are steadfast, unafraid of difficulties, and bravely advance along the general line of socialist construction, their revolutionary cause will surely succeed; they will be honored and praised by the people forever, just like the many revolutionary heroes of the past. As for the enemies at home and abroad, they are praying to their God day and night, fantasizing that our revolutionary cause will fail. As long as they can live a few more years, they will feel even more desperate and sad.

As a proletarian revolutionary, we must have the steadfastness of a rock. Think of the rocks on the seashore! You see them, some standing tall, some squatting, some pointing to the blue sky, some facing the sea. When did they stand there? How many storms and rains have they experienced, and how many times have they endured the impact of raging waves? But they never waver! How steadfast they are! On the night of storms and rains, the wind wants to completely overturn them, the rain wants to drive them into the sand, and the waves want to roll them into the sea. But they stand still. When the wind and rain are over, when the waves recede, they still stand on the seashore, pointing to the blue sky and facing the sea.

We should praise the steadfastness of rocks. We should learn from the steadfastness of rocks. We should have a strong belief in the revolution. This should be the case in the years of revolutionary war, and it should be even more so in the years of socialist construction. (Originally published in Guangdong's "Upstream" No. 16, 1959)

### 革命的坚定性

    革命的坚定性	陶铸
    革命的坚定性，是我们无产阶级政党的一种非常宝贵的品德。在过去革命战争的年代中，我们需要革命的坚定性，需要高度发扬这种崇高的品德；在现在革命建设的年代中，我们更需要革命的坚定性，使这种祟高的品德大放光芒。
    革命的坚定性和革命的彻底性是密切地联系着的。认不清革命的崇高伟大的目标，看不见革命的光明远大的前途，要想有革命的坚定性是不可能的；同样地，只是对革命有着一种向往，一个目标，而不是用革命的坚定性，用百折不挠的精神去实现它，那末，这个目标再崇高，再伟大，也是没有办法达到的。这正如爬山一样，当你选择好最高的顶峰，选择好攀登上去的道路以后，这就需要有坚定不移的决心，百折不挠的勇气。因为只有这样，你才不会为半途中的坎坷不平的道路所难倒，你才不会在悬崖峭壁之间摇头叹气，你才不会被丛生的荆棘挡住去路。你才会毫不犹豫，毫不动摇地勇往直前，攀登到那光辉的最高峰。因此，越是彻底的革命目标，越是需要革命的坚定性。共产党人之所以在任何时候都对自己的革命事业信心百倍，从不悲观，从不动摇，一方面是由于我们所从事的事业是实现共产主义，这是人类最崇高的理想，也是革命的最伟大、最光荣的目标；但另方面，也是由于我们明确地认识到历史的发展的必然规律，这个目标只要经过我们矢志不渝的努力，是一定可以实现的。
    回想到我们革命胜利之前，那时候，多少共产党员和多少革命者，为了他们的伟大理想，为了他们的坚强信念，而冒险犯难，东奔西走。他们不计名利，不图享受；他们不怕坐牢，不怕杀头；他们不怕妻离子散，家破人亡。他们唯一想到的就是怎样挽救我们民族的危亡，怎样推翻那个人压迫人、人剥削人的万恶的旧社会，怎样在这样一个国家里建成共产主义社会，使全国人民、使我们的子子孙孙得过幸福的日子。他们为了这一光辉的革命事业，付出了数不清的代价，甚至他们自己的宝贵的生命。而且在他们付出任何代价的时候，仍然是洋溢着革命的乐观主义精神，表现了至死不渝的革命坚定性。“革命烈士诗钞”里有夏明翰同志就义前的四句诗：
    “砍头不要紧，只要主义真。
    杀了夏明翰，还有后来人。”
    这四句诗，充分地表现了一个共产党员，一个革命者对革命的坚强无比的信念。对于个人来说，头颅是不要紧的，生命是不足惜的，只要你是一个真正的共产主义者，你是无所畏惧的。对于整个革命来说，死了一个革命者，当然是一种损失，但是，这不要紧，因为共产主义是真理，是历史发展规律所必然达到的，而且一个人倒下去，就会有千千万万的后继者站起来，继续奋勇地战斗，革命终会胜利。像夏明翰烈士这样的同志，在我们革命队伍中真不知有多少。也只是因为有了这许多杀不退、吓不倒的无比坚定的人们，才使中国的革命取得了光辉的胜利。
    这些坚定的人，好比屹立天地的岩石。它们（火成岩、水成岩或变质岩）诞生于“水深火热”之中，经过大水和烈火的锻炼，它们生成了一身坚强的筋骨，所以特别经得起狂风疾雨的打击。现在我们想起这些人的坚定不移的革命精神，总会流露出一种“高山仰止，景行行止”的感情，对他们肃然起敬。
    我国革命胜利已经十年了。压在我们头上的三座大山——帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义——被推翻了，残酷的流血的斗争过去了，我们正从事于社会主义的建设。但是，为什么在这个时候，还需要革命的坚定性，而且还要更加强调革命的坚定性呢？
    道理是十分清楚的。我们虽然推翻了三座大山，但这只是我们的整个革命途程中的第一步，还有下一步——从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期我们正在走着。在过渡时期中，如马克思所说的，我们不但要消灭一切剥削制度，结束几千年来人剥削人的历史，而且要和过去遗留下来的各种旧观念作彻底的决裂。即是说，我们要在经济上，政治上和思想上，同资产阶级进行坚决的彻底的斗争。这一斗争，和过去的新民主主义革命的斗争比较起来，虽然不是一场流血的战争，但却是一个更深刻、更广泛的、持久的斗争。这一斗争，现在虽然随着我国对于旧的社会经济制度改造的基本完成和1957年整风反右斗争的重大收获，而取得了基本上的胜利，但资产阶级和小资产阶级的习惯势力，还未彻底克服，资产阶级残余的思想政治活动依然存在，因而我们同资产阶级的思想政治斗争，依然是高一阵低一阵的波浪式的在进行着。特别要注意的，就是由于这一斗争的深刻、广泛和持久，它不能不在我们的队伍中有所反映。我们革命队伍中有少数受资产阶级思想影响较深的人，这些人，那怕他是坚决反抗过帝国主义、封建主义的，也模糊地有点相信社会主义，如果他不彻底改造自己的思想，对社会主义建设没有充分的精神准备，并且缺少对无产阶级事业的革命坚定性，那么，他便划不清资产阶级革命家和无产阶级革命家的界线，他就会在社会主义建设中遇到一点风险便摇摆起来，最后甚至会成为资产阶级在党内的代理人，而革命就不能不革到他自己的头上了。我们党内的右派分子和一些右倾机会主义分子，就是这样的。因此，在社会主义革命还未彻底完成，我们和资产阶级的思想政治斗争还未彻底熄灭的时候，我们还极其需要革命的坚定性，需要更加强调革命的坚定性。
    就社会主义建设来说，在我们这样一个“一穷二白”的国家里，要建设成一个有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富强的国家，自然不是一朝一夕的工夫，但我们必须争取尽可能快的高速度，因为这不仅是我国人民的强烈愿望，而且事实证明是完全可能的。既然是这样，在整个建设的过程中，一定会有很多的困难，会出现一定程度的紧张。更何况帝国主义及其走狗们还在对我们虎视眈眈，伺机破坏；更何况残存在人们头脑中的资产阶级思想和经常发生的右倾保守思想，还时时成为我们前进中的阻力；更何况在向自然界作斗争的过程中，由于我们对它认识不够，而经常可能产生畏难的思想和情绪。因此，在这样复杂而艰苦的建设路途中，我们要和资产阶级的思想影响作战，和右倾保守思想作战，和愚昧、懒惰作战，和时间作战，……要得到革命全面的彻底的胜利，我们没有百折不挠的革命坚定性，那是万万不能的！
    自然，建设的年代不同于过去战争的年代。过去，在反革命势力的残酷摧残压迫下，革命者为了坚持革命斗争，要随时准备着断头流血，牺牲性命。现在，一般说来，我们还是处于和平的环境中，过去那种危险是不存在了。但是，就革命事业的艰苦性以及它对革命者的要求上来看，其实是没有什么区别的。它们不都是同样地要求我们坚定不移，蔑视困难，为了革命事业随时贡献自己的一切？
    就这几年来说，坚定地献身社会主义建设事业的人，真是数不胜数。在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指引下，他们不怕困难，不知疲倦；他们敢想敢干，大胆创造；他们一直和那些右倾保守主义作斗争，始终高举着大跃进的红旗，奋勇向前迈进。他们从来不肯停留，他们从来不计较个人的得失，他们一心想望着的只是怎样迅速地改变我们国家的“一穷二白”的面貌，迅速地使高度发达的社会主义社会在我国建成。他们的英勇行为虽不是抛头颅，洒热血，但是他们对革命事业的忠心耿耿，不怕牺牲，对革命目标的坚定不移的精神则完全是一样的。至于为了革命的事业，贡献出自己宝贵的生命的如向秀丽等同志那样的人，就更不用说了。
    和革命的坚定性相反的是对革命的动摇性。在革命的历史中，越是在严峻的日子里，这一界线也划得越加分明。在社会主义建设年代，对革命的动摇性当然表现得不像过去战争的年代那么直接了，但是，确实有一部分人对社会主义建设缺乏信心，对能不能在我们这样一个国家里迅速地建成高度发达的社会主义社会表示怀疑。这主要是表现在对去年大跃进与人民公社的建立的伟大意义认识不足，他们是“四平八稳”论者，经不得一点紧张；他们是以老爷式的态度来对待革命群众运动，在放手发动群众过程中似乎是不能出一点偏差的，他们也有一点要搞社会主义的愿望，但又不愿付出一点点代价，他们一直是从右倾机会主义，从右倾保守的观点来理解总路线，认为要多快好省地建设社会主义的提法是有矛盾的，怀疑人民公社是否搞坏了，多搞点重工业是否划得来，他们夸大了大跃进和人民公社运动中的某些暂时性的、局部性的、早已克服了或正在克服中的缺点，否定我们所取得的伟大成就；当他们在遇到某些困难时便唉声叹气，裹足不前；他们可以因为暂时买不到一斤猪肉一块肥皂便闭上眼睛，看不到社会主义的光明远景。……自然，这样的人是革命队伍中的一小部分，但是从这里更可以看出，他们和我们那些始终是朝气勃勃，干劲冲天，坚忍不拔，一往无前的同志们有多么不同！当然，这样的人还是可以教育改造而获得无产阶级革命的坚定性的，如果他们不愿意做到这一点，那他一定会为社会主义革命和建设的前进车轮所抛弃！
    从这里可以看出，在社会主义建设时期，一个共产党员，或是一个革命者，对革命彻底性与革命坚定性的认识与坚持，是多么的需要，多么的珍贵！
    历史已经证明而且将要继续证明：胜利是永远属于最坚定的人的。鲁迅也说过：在革命进行的时候，“时时有人退伍，有人落荒，有人颓唐，有人叛变，然而只要无碍于进行，则愈到后来，这队伍就愈成为纯粹、精锐的队伍了”。总路线、大跃进、人民公社这列飞奔疾驰的革命列车，将把那些意志脆弱的，动摇不定的人，抛在远远的后头；坚强的革命的队伍，一定能够胜利地达到光荣伟大的目的地。一切动摇的人，如不认清形势，迅速坚定过来，他将一事无成，可悲可耻。一切坚定不移，不怕困难，英勇地沿着社会主义建设总路线前进的人们，他们的革命事业一定会成功；他们将和过去的许多革命英雄一样，永远光荣地受到人们的称誉。至于国内外的敌人，他们日夜在祈祷他们的上帝，幻想我们的革命事业会失败，只要他们能多活几年，他们便会更加感到绝望的悲哀的。
    我们作为一个无产阶级的革命家，一定要有像岩石一般的坚定。想想那海岸边的岩石吧！你看它们，有的矗立着，有的蹲伏着，有的指向青天，有的面对大海。它们是什么时候就在那里了呢，它们曾经经历过多少次狂风暴雨的侵袭，它们曾经忍受了多少遍惊涛骇浪的冲击呵？然而它们从不动摇！它们是多么的坚定！当狂风暴雨之夜，风想把它们彻底掀翻，雨想把它们打进沙滩，浪涛想把它们卷入大海。但是它们屹然不动。当风雨过后，当浪涛退后，它们仍旧矗立在海边，指向青天，面对大海。
    我们应该赞美岩石的坚定。我们应该学习岩石的坚定。我们应该对革命有着坚强的信念。在革命的战争年代应该如此，在社会主义建设的年代更应该如此。　（原载广东“上游”1959年第十六期）
