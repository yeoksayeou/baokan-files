On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution, I bring the warmest congratulations of the Communist Party of Sweden to the Chinese people and their Communist Party.

I think you remember that Sweden was one of the first capitalist countries to establish normal and friendly relations with the new China, and the Swedish representative to the United Nations has long fought for the rights of the People's Republic of China in international discussions.

I also feel that I can express the admiration of the entire Swedish people for your revolution, and their confidence in the bright future of the world's largest country.

Your revolution drove away all invaders, making China a free and strong country. This revolution freed the Chinese people from the enslavement of successive autocratic regimes and ended capitalist exploitation. The demon of hunger has been driven out of the land of China forever; women have gained equal rights, and young people and children look forward to a bright and happy future, which generations past have never had. The Swedish language is insufficient to describe the strength and speed of your socialist construction. Your Great Leap Forward has given confidence and hope to all those who strive for freedom, democracy, peace, and socialism.

During my two weeks of visiting your country, I was deeply impressed by the high level of working enthusiasm of the people and heroes. While the face of the country has changed, the people have also changed. An army of labor heroes is advancing!

They reminded me of Comrade Mao Zedong's heroic words: "To count the outstanding figures, we still have to look at the present!"

Long live the new China!

Long live the noble struggle for peace and socialism! (with picture)

    瑞典共产党中央委员会主席、瑞典共产党代表团团长
    希尔丁·哈格堡同志的贺词
    在中国革命胜利十周年纪念的前夕，我把瑞典共产党的最热烈的祝贺带给中国人民和他们的共产党。
    我想你们记得，瑞典是首先同新中国建立正常友好关系的资本主义国家中的一个，瑞典驻联合国的代表长期以来一直在为中华人民共和国在国际讨论中的权利而奋斗。
    我还觉得，我可以表达瑞典全体人民对你们的革命的钦佩之情，和他们对于世界上最大的国家的光辉未来所抱的信心。
    你们的革命赶走了一切侵略者，使中国成为一个自由强大的国家。这一革命使中国人民摆脱了历代专制政权的奴役，并结束了资本主义的剥削。饥饿的魔鬼已经永远地被赶出了中国的土地；妇女获得了平等的权利，青年和儿童瞻望着光明幸福的未来，这是过去几代人从来不曾有过的。瑞典的语言不足以描述你们社会主义建设的力量和速度。你们的大跃进使一切争取自由、民主、和平和社会主义的人们有了信心和希望。
    我在访问你们国家的两个星期时间里，我对于人民和英雄们高度工作热情得到深刻的印象，在国家面貌改变的同时，人民也起了变化，一支劳动英雄的大军正在前进！
    他们使我记起了毛泽东同志的豪迈的话语：“数英雄人物，还看今朝！”
    新中国万岁！
    争取和平和社会主义的崇高斗争万岁！（附图片）
