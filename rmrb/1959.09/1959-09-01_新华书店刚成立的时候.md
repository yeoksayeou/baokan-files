　　When Xinhua Bookstore Was First Established
　　　　　　Zhou Baochang
　　On September 1, 1939, Xinhua Bookstore was established in Yan'an, the sacred site of the Chinese revolution. Twenty years later, today, with the development and victory of the Chinese revolution, our bookstore, under the leadership of the Party, has, like other undertakings, developed into an increasingly strong and indispensable force on the cultural front. Twenty years, this is an arduous and tortuous process, a process of overcoming countless difficulties, and also a process of achieving victory.
　　Speaking of the establishment of Xinhua Bookstore, one cannot help but think of Guanghua Bookstore, which existed in Yan'an before the establishment of Xinhua Bookstore. It was established around June or July 1937. The address was in Yan'an city, in the west lane in front of the government, opposite the clock tower. Its form was two storefronts, with glass doors and windows, which could be considered a modern shop in Yan'an at that time. Business was very good, and new books were snapped up. Later, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and Yan'an became a target for enemy bombing. Around October, it had to move to the Western Hills, where three cave dwellings (pictured below) were dug out to serve as the sales department, stationery department, and dormitory. At that time, the most popular book published by Jiefang (Liberation) Publishing House was Lenin's work "Karl Marx." In addition, with the constant arrival of books from the Xi'an Life Bookstore, business expanded daily, and the original three staff members could no longer cope. Four graduates were transferred from the Shaanbei Public School. They were four female comrades, wearing gray military uniforms, with ruddy complexions and radiant spirits, enthusiastically receiving readers in the sales department all day long.
　　Around July 1938, due to traffic obstruction and the blockade by the Kuomintang reactionaries, books and periodicals could no longer be sent from Xi'an. Thus, Guanghua Bookstore merged into Guanghua Store, becoming a part of the store. The address was moved from the original Western Hills to the newly opened New Market in the mountain gully outside the South Gate.
　　The Party Central Committee attached great importance to distribution work, pointing out that this work was a tool for the Party to connect with the masses, a powerful weapon for the Party to publicize policies and disseminate Marxism-Leninism to the masses. Therefore, on June 1, 1939, the Distribution Department of the CPC Central Committee was established (later renamed the Central Publishing and Distribution Department), with Li Fuchun, then Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department, concurrently serving as the Minister of the Publishing and Distribution Department. After the Party strengthened its leadership over distribution work, it felt the need to establish a public distribution organization. Thus, Xinhua Bookstore was born. On September 1, 1939, "Xinhua Bookstore," written by Chairman Mao himself, appeared in Yan'an and also on our publications.
　　When Xinhua Bookstore was first established, it moved the original Guanghua Bookstore's stock and bookshelves over. The address was the old site of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts outside the North Gate of Yan'an. The Central Workers' Movement Committee resided on the mountain, and there were seven bungalows (pictured top right) at the foot of the mountain, which were used as offices for the sales, wholesale, periodical distribution, and purchasing departments. The entire store had no more than ten employees. The comrades working in the bookstore were almost all under the age of twenty-two. In a tense, lively, united, and friendly collective life, our work was combat-oriented, and our life was militarized. From morning till night, everyone was inseparable. We sang our self-composed store song:
　　The sun hangs on Jialing Mountain,
　　The Yan River winds before our eyes,
　　We work here,
　　A group of revolutionary seed spreaders.
　　We are as happy and brave as the sun,
　　Like the Yan River, flowing endlessly to the far reaches. . .
　　Everyone worked together, studied together, and also played ping-pong and basketball together every day. We were a work team, a singing team, a study group, and a sports group. Before going to bed, we always sang the March of the Eighth Route Army: "Forward, forward, forward!..."
　　At that time, Xinhua Bookstore was responsible for the distribution of publications from Jiefang Publishing House, and also for the distribution of the Party Central Committee's newspaper, "Liberation Daily." We were subjected to layers of blockades by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and sometimes also restricted by natural conditions. Books were generally sent to the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines through the Eighth Route Army's supply stations. A donkey carried some books, and sometimes people had to be sent to escort them. Cadres going from Yan'an to the enemy's rear often became volunteer transporters for the bookstore. They regarded books as more precious than their own belongings. Often during marches, in encounters with the enemy, they would rather lose their bedding than let the Party's publications be lost. At that time, sending books and newspapers to the Kuomintang-controlled areas was equally difficult. The Kuomintang's postal inspection often detained our publications, and sometimes readers who received books and periodicals might be persecuted. Under this strict blockade policy and inspection system, the distribution workers did not bow their heads. The distribution workers learned the art of struggle, transporting books to the border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, sending them to the Kuomintang-controlled areas through merchants, disguised and packaged, for mailing, and some were transported to the Xi'an Eighth Route Army office for forwarding. In short, the cost of a book greatly exceeded the price of the book, and the manpower and material resources spent were incalculable. In this environment, the responsibility and its significance of the distribution workers were reflected so profoundly! Looking back, our working conditions today are thousands of times better! Speaking of natural restrictions, the printing factory was on Qingliang Mountain in the east, separated from the Western Hills by only a river, but during the rainy season, mountain floods often broke out, and the floodwaters cut off traffic. Sometimes, the "Liberation Daily" could not be distributed on that day. So many readers were waiting to read the newspaper! The flood of the Yan River was fierce and rapid, with great impact, which had to affect our work.
　　Later, the environment became even worse, and the enemy and the Kuomintang reactionaries tightened their blockade even more. However, the distribution workers still persevered to the end, and there were more and more methods. These were methods that the enemy forced us to find. If there was no paper, we made it ourselves. If transporting books was too conspicuous, we transported proofs for reprinting. Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" was secretly transported in proof form to Chongqing and Hong Kong for reprinting, with one printing run being twelve thousand or twenty thousand copies. Subsequently, Xinhua Bookstores were also established one after another in various anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, and they regarded reprinting publications from Jiefang Publishing House as their main business. The Xinhua Bookstore's cause gradually moved from its initial stage to becoming stronger. (Attached pictures)

    新华书店刚成立的时候
                周保昌
    1939年9月1日，在中国革命圣地——延安，成立了新华书店。二十年后的今天，我们的书店随着中国革命的发展、胜利，在党的领导下，也和其他事业一样，已经发展成为日益强大的、在文化战线上不可缺少的力量。二十年，这是一段艰苦曲折的过程，是克服无数困难的过程，也是取得胜利的过程。
    提到新华书店的成立，不得不使人想到在新华书店成立以前，延安就有了一个光华书店，它是在1937年6、7月间成立的。地址是在延安城内府前西巷钟楼斜对面，其形式是两间门面，门和橱窗都是玻璃的，算得上当时延安的新式铺子。营业很好，新书一抢而光。后来抗战爆发，延安成了敌机轰炸的目标，约在10月间，不得不搬到西山上去，在山上挖了三个窑洞（下图），成了门市部、文具部、宿舍。当时解放社出版的列宁著作“卡尔·马克思”，是一本最受欢迎的书。再加上西安生活书店不断地寄些书来，营业日益扩大，原有的三个工作人员已不能应付，又从陕北公学调来了四位毕业生。她们是四位女同志，穿着灰色军装，红光满面，精神焕发，整天在门市部热情地接待读者。
    1938年7月间，由于交通阻塞，国民党反动派的封锁，西安方面来不了书刊，这样，光华书店就合并到光华商店，成为商店的一部分，地址由原来的西山搬到了南门外山沟里新开辟的新市场去了。
    党中央非常重视发行工作，指出这个工作是党联系群众的工具，是党向群众宣传政策，传播马克思列宁主义的有力武器，因此，在1939年6月1日，成立了中共中央发行部（后又改为中央出版发行部），由当时的中央组织部副部长李富春同志兼任出版发行部的部长。党对发行工作加强领导以后，感到有需要成立一个公开的发行机构，这样，新华书店就诞生了。1939年9月1日，毛主席亲笔所写的“新华书店”在延安出现了，也在我们的出版物上出现了。
    新华书店初创时，把原来光华书店的存货和书架搬了过来，地址在延安北门外鲁迅艺术学院的旧址，山上是中央职工运动委员会的住处，山下有七间平房（右上图），用来作为门市、批发、期刊发行、进货等部门办公室。全店工作人员没有超过十个人。在书店工作的同志差不多都在二十二岁以下，在紧张、活泼、团结、友爱的集体生活中，我们的工作战斗化，生活军事化，从早到晚，大家形影不离。我们唱着自己编的店歌：
    太阳挂在嘉陵山，
    延水弯弯在眼前，
    我们在这里工作，
    一群革命种籽的传播者。
    我们像太阳那么欢欣、勇敢，
    像延水无尽止地流到辽远。……
    大家天天一起工作，一起学习，还一起打乒乓球和篮球，又是工作队，又是歌咏队，又是学习组，又是体育组。睡觉以前，总要唱一首八路军进行曲：“向前，向前，向前！……”
    当时，新华书店担负了解放社出版物的发行任务，同时还担负着党中央机关报“解放日报”的发行任务。我们受到日本帝国主义、国民党反动派的层层封锁，有时还受着自然条件的限制。给敌人后方各抗日根据地发书，一般是通过八路军的兵站来转运的，一个毛驴子带点书，有时还要派人押运。从延安去敌后的干部也常常成为书店的义务运输员。他们把书看作比自己的财物还要贵重，常常在行军途中，在与敌人遭遇战中，宁肯丢了自己的被服，决不让党的出版物丢掉。当时发到国民党统治地区去的书报，也是一样困难，国民党的邮政检查，常常把我们的出版物扣留起来，有时收到书刊的读者可能受到迫害。在这种严密的封锁政策、检查制度下，发行工作者没有低头，发行工作者学会了斗争的艺术，把书运到陕甘宁边区的边境，通过商人，伪装包扎，送到国民党统治区去投邮，有的运到西安八路军办事处去转发。总之，一本书所花的代价，大大地超过了书的定价，所花的人力物力是难以计算的，在这种环境里，发行工作者的责任和它的意义是体现得多么深刻！回想起来，我们今天的工作条件，不知要优越千万倍！再说自然的限制，印刷厂是在东边清凉山上，与西山只是一河之隔，但雨季里，时常遇到山洪暴发，大水冲来，把交通阻断，有时当天的“解放日报”就发行不了。多少读者在等着看报呀！延河的洪水，又猛又急，冲击力极大，使我们的工作不得不受到影响。
    以后，环境更加恶劣，敌人和国民党反动派封锁更严，但是发行工作者仍然坚持到底，而且办法越来越多，这是敌人逼着我们找出来的办法，没有纸张，自己造，运书目标太大，就运清样去翻印。毛主席的“新民主主义论”就是秘密运清样到重庆、香港翻印的，一印就是一万二万。接着，在敌后各个抗日根据地也纷纷地成立了新华书店，他们把翻印解放社的出版物作为主要的业务。新华书店的事业就由草创时期逐步走向壮大了。（附图片）
