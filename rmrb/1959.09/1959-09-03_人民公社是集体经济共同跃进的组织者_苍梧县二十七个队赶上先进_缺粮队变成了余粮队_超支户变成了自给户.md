Nanning, September 2nd (report from our newspaper) – After only one year of the establishment of the people's commune, twenty-seven relatively economically backward production brigades in Cangwu County, Guangxi, have changed their poor and backward appearance and caught up with the production level of the local rich teams due to the rapid development of productive forces. This fact fully demonstrates that the people's commune is more powerful and superior in organizing production than the previous cooperatives.

Some of these backward teams are located on small islands in the middle of the river, with a large population and little land; some are located in low-lying areas by the river, which are often either flooded or drought-stricken; some are located on high mountains, with thin soil; and some are hidden between high mountains and ridges, with insufficient sunlight. Since liberation, especially since agricultural cooperation, the production situation in these places has developed year by year. However, due to the small organizational scale of agricultural cooperatives, the speed of production development and improvement of living standards is still relatively slow.

In the short year after the establishment of the people's commune, the situation has undergone fundamental changes.

This year's early rice production of six brigades increased by more than 40% to 50% compared with the same period last year, eight brigades increased by 20% to 30%, and the remaining thirteen brigades also increased by more than 10%. They have all changed from grain-deficient teams to grain-surplus teams. In addition to retaining rations, seeds, and fodder, they have all completed and overfulfilled the summer grain purchase tasks. The diversified management of these teams has also greatly developed, and the economic income of the commune members has increased sharply. The sideline income of the Qilin Brigade of the Renhe Commune in the first half of this year increased by 52.6% compared with the same period last year, with an average of 51 yuan per worker. The Sluo Brigade of the Xindi Commune has developed even faster. The total income from industry and sideline production in the first half of this year was 17,200 yuan, an increase of sixteen times compared with the same period last year. The household with the most income from the summer harvest distribution reached 110 yuan. The members of this brigade have a total deposit of 1,680 yuan. Most of the overspending households in these twenty-seven brigades in Cangwu County during the period of advanced cooperatives have now become self-sufficient households, and about 30% of the households in some teams have savings. As more and more backward teams catch up with the production and living standards of the advanced teams, a new situation of balanced economic development has emerged in the communes. This new situation has laid an economic foundation for the future transition from small collective ownership to large collective ownership.

In the process of backward teams catching up with advanced teams, the superiority of the people's commune in organizing and leading large-scale production is fully demonstrated. First of all, each people's commune operates a number of industries and sideline businesses. This part of the wealth is the main economic force for the commune to help backward teams develop production. For example, the Xiaying Commune, according to local production conditions and characteristics, operates industries and sideline businesses such as manufacturing boat nails, fishing for fry, raising fish, building wooden boats, manufacturing agricultural tools, mining, and producing wood. These productions have now generated more than 420,000 yuan in income. A portion of this is used as interest-free loans to backward teams to help them develop production. Due to the great development of the commune's economy, this commune also has a special fund to assist backward teams, providing free production materials for backward teams and supporting the development of diversified management. Seven backward brigades have received an average of more than 1,000 yuan worth of seeds, sugarcane seedlings, fruit seedlings, fish fry, and other production materials. In addition, the commune raised hundreds of thousands of fish this year, and plans to organize several backward teams to catch some at the end of the year to increase their income. Six backward teams in this commune are located in low-lying areas along the Fu River and are often subject to floods. With the help of the commune, they built two flood control gates and eight reservoirs and ponds, which can ensure that more than 1,000 mu of fields are protected from drought and waterlogging.

Secondly, under the unified leadership of the commune, the fraternal brigades have demonstrated a communist spirit and actively supported the backward teams in various aspects. The Sizhou Brigade of the Renhe Commune is a small island on the West River. There are many people and little land, with an average of only five fen of land per person. In the past, not only was little rice planted, but other production was also not developed. Often a portion of the masses drifted to the cities, and those at home had to rely on state loans for assistance. After communization, the commune party committee strengthened its leadership over this brigade and sent cadres to help the Sizhou Brigade develop production in a comprehensive manner according to local conditions. At the same time, under the principle of equal exchange, the Sichong and Zhengyang Brigades dispatched various technical cadres to reside in the Sizhou Brigade for a long time, teaching techniques for raising fish, silkworms, pigs, planting vegetables, and planting sugarcane. The brigades also allocated sufficient tools and cattle for these productions to the Sizhou Brigade. With the support of the fraternal brigades, the Sizhou Brigade has developed diversified management, and yields have also increased significantly. Sugarcane has increased from 4,200 jin per mu to more than 10,800 jin; the number of sows has increased from 22 to 132, and the number of pigs in stock has reached more than 1,030. From the establishment of the commune to the present, the total income has been more than 200,000 yuan. After the summer harvest distribution, the entire brigade had a surplus of more than 20,000 yuan, which was used as public accumulation to expand reproduction.

The commune's strengthening of political and ideological leadership over backward teams, and constantly improving the ideological awareness of commune members, prompting these brigades to strive for progress and self-reliance, is also an important reason for changing their appearance.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, under the strong leadership of the commune, the backward teams have universally launched a nationwide debate on "Is backwardness innate?" and "How to promote favorable conditions and change backwardness." Through debate, the right-leaning conservative ideas of belittling oneself and "regional backwardness theory" were broken, and the ideas of "everything depends on people, and people can conquer nature" were established, and inspections, appraisals, and labor competitions were frequently carried out. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for labor is unprecedentedly high. For example, in the Wuling Brigade of the Changfa Commune, more than one-third of the fields were often subject to drought and the yield was very low. In order to transform the low-yielding fields, they split mountains to divert water and built a 25-li-long canal, which provided sufficient water for more than 700 mu of dry land and achieved a large increase in production.

    人民公社是集体经济共同跃进的组织者
    苍梧县二十七个队赶上先进
    缺粮队变成了余粮队  超支户变成了自给户
    本报南宁2日电　人民公社成立才一年，广西苍梧县的二十七个经济比较落后的生产大队，由于生产力得到了迅速发展，改变了贫困落后面貌，赶上当地富队的生产水平。这一事实，充分显示了人民公社在组织生产方面，比之过去的合作社更加有力，更加优越。
    这些落后队，有的是江心小岛，人多地少；有的处于河边洼地，经常不涝则旱；有的位于高山云巅，土壤瘦薄；有的藏在高山峻岭之间，阳光不足。这些地方，解放以来，特别是在农业合作化以来，生产情况逐年都有发展。但是，由于农业社组织规模小，生产发展和生活改善的速度还是比较慢。
    在人民公社成立后的短短一年间，情况却发生了根本的变化。
    今年早稻有六个大队比去年同期增产了四成到五成以上，八个大队增产了两成到三成，其余的十三个大队也增产一成以上。它们都由缺粮队变成了余粮队，除了留下口粮、种子、饲料外，都完成和超额完成了夏季公粮的征购任务。这些队的多种经营也有很大发展，社员的经济收入激增。人和公社麒麟大队今年上半年的副业收入，比去年同期增长了52.6％，平均每个劳动力分得五十一元。新地公社四落大队发展的更快，今年上半年工业和副业总收入一万七千二百元，比去年同期增长十六倍。夏收分配最多的户收入达一百一十元之多。这个大队的社员共有一千六百八十元的存款。苍梧县这二十七个大队在过去高级社时的超支户，现在绝大部分已变成了自给户，部分队约有30％的户有了存款。由于越来越多的落后队赶上了先进队的生产生活水平，各公社出现了经济趋于平衡发展的新局面。这一新局面为将来由小集体所有制过渡到大集体所有制，打下了经济基础。
    在落后队赶先进队的过程中，充分显示了人民公社在组织和领导大规模生产上的优越性。首先是各人民公社都经营了一批工业和副业。这一部分财富是公社扶助落后队发展生产的主要经济力量。例如夏郢公社，根据当地的生产条件和特点，经营的工业和副业有制造船钉、捞鱼苗、养鱼、建造木船、制造农具、开矿、生产木材等。这些生产，到现在已经收入四十二万多元。其中一部分作为无息贷款，借给落后队，帮助他们发展生产。由于公社经济的大发展，这个公社还另有一笔扶助落后队的专款，无偿的为落后队添置生产资料，支持发展多种经营。有七个落后的大队，平均每队得到价值一千多元的种子、甘蔗苗、果树苗、鱼苗及其他生产资料的援助。另外，公社今年养了几十万尾鱼，准备年底组织几个落后队去打一部分，使他们增加收入。这个公社有六个落后队位于抚河边的洼地，经常遭受水灾。它们在公社的帮助下，修建了两个防水闸、八个水库水塘，可保证一千多亩田免受干旱和水淹。
    其次在公社的统一领导下，各兄弟大队发挥了共产主义风格，积极从各方面支援落后队。人和公社泗洲大队，是西江上的一个小岛。人多地少，平均每人只有五分地。以前不仅水稻种的少，其他生产也没有发展。经常有一部分群众流散到城市，在家的也得靠国家贷款帮助。公社化以后，公社党委加强了对这个大队的领导，派去干部帮助泗洲大队因地制宜地全面规划发展生产。同时，在等价交换的原则下，寺冲、正阳等大队派出了各种技术干部，长住泗洲大队，传授养鱼、养蚕、养猪、种植蔬菜、种甘蔗等技术。各大队还调配了足够的从事这些生产的工具和耕牛给泗洲大队。在各个兄弟大队支援下，泗洲大队开展了多种经营，产量也显著提高。甘蔗由亩产四千二百斤上升到一万零八百多斤；母猪由二十二头发展到一百三十二头，存栏猪达一千零三十多头。从公社成立到现在，总共收入二十多万元。夏收分配后，全大队结余二万多元，作为公共积累，扩大再生产。
    公社加强对落后队的政治思想领导，不断提高社员的思想觉悟，促使这些大队发奋图强，自力更生，也是改变面貌的重要原因。
    自去年大跃进以来，在公社强有力的领导下，各个落后队普遍开展“落后是不是天生注定的？”“怎样发扬有利条件，改变落后面貌”的全民性大辩论。通过辩论，打破了妄自菲薄和“地区落后论”的右倾保守思想，树立了“事在人为，人定胜天”的思想，并经常开展检查评比和劳动竞赛。因此，广大社员的劳动积极性空前高涨。例如长发公社武岭大队，原来有三分之一以上的田经常受旱，产量很低。为了改造低产田，他们劈山引水，修了一条二十五里长的水渠，使七百多亩旱田得到了充足的水源，获得了大增产。
