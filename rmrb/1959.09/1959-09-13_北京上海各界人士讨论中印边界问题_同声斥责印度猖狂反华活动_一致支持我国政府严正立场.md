Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 12th. Group meetings of the Beijing Municipal Third People's Congress and the Second Committee of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference held today unanimously and enthusiastically supported the solemn position of our government on the Sino-Indian border issue, and condemned the rampant anti-China activities stirred up by certain people in India.

Zhai Weifan, member of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, member of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, and chief engineer of the Water Transport Planning and Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications, who had been to the Sino-Indian border, said: "The language, customs, habits, and architecture of the people in the area where China and India's Kashmir border meet are completely the same as those in China's Tibet and very different from those in India. The people there have historically been Chinese citizens, but Indian maps have marked a large part of this area as within Indian territory. In September 1958, fifteen Indian troops invaded the Dahongliutan area. It is clear that India is encroaching on Chinese territory, but the Indian government is slandering China for occupying Indian land. Isn't this turning black into white? The Chinese people will never tolerate such unreasonable behavior." Hou Renzhi, a municipal people's representative and professor of the Department of Geology and Geography at Peking University, said: The so-called Sino-Indian border issue was created entirely by British imperialism and is the product of its aggressive policy. Strangely, India, which gained independence after throwing off the rule of British imperialism, has inherited the mantle of British imperialism, regarding the illegal McMahon Line, which even the British themselves did not dare to openly acknowledge, as a treasure, and provoking the Chinese people who have already stood up. Indian troops and administrative personnel have even crossed their so-called McMahon Line, invaded our territory, and even slandered us as "aggressors." Even more absurdly, Prime Minister Nehru actually defended the so-called McMahon Line, saying that this line "happens to have a geographical advantage" because it is a "clear watershed." If a watershed can be used as a geographical "advantage" to change national borders, then I don't know how many neighboring countries in the world today would have to redraw their borders. This argument is obviously untenable. Hou Renzhi said that we must warn the Indian authorities that your unreasonable attitude on the Sino-Indian border issue will only benefit imperialism and will be extremely detrimental to India itself and Sino-Indian friendship. Chang Renxia, member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, who taught at Visva-Bharati University in India for three years, said: China and India have a friendly history of thousands of years, and there has never been a border issue. British imperialists, in order to expand into Tibet, China, used political conspiracies and demarcated the so-called McMahon Line, and India today wants to inherit this shameful aggressive plan left by British imperialism and impose it on us. This is definitely impossible. British imperialism is the common enemy of China and India. India has forgotten the days of oppression in the past and today wants to inherit the mantle of imperialism to oppress us. This is completely wrong. Hang Baohua, chairman of the trade union of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and an old worker of the "February 7th" strike, said that the Chinese people who have stood up will absolutely not recognize the McMahon Line plotted by British imperialism. It is universally acknowledged by the people of the world that China has no intention of "aggression" abroad. India has occupied Chinese territory and instead slandered China for aggression. This is really turning right and wrong and making trouble out of nothing. Fu Zongkun, a municipal people's representative from the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune, said: All members of our commune are very angry about India's occupation of our territory. Everyone believes that certain people in India with ulterior motives are attempting to impose the illegal McMahon Line on our country, which is intolerable to the liberated Chinese people and all commune members. We demand that the Indian government immediately return to the Five Principles and resolve the border issue between the two countries through consultation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 12th. At an enlarged meeting held by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference today to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue, speakers unanimously and firmly supported the solemn position and consistent policy adopted by our government in handling the Sino-Indian border issue; expressed great indignation at the anti-China activities once again instigated by certain political figures in India after the Tibetan rebellion. They protested against the Indian government's unreasonable behavior of reversing black and white, making unfounded accusations against our country, and exerting pressure on our country in military, diplomatic, and public opinion aspects in an attempt to impose the Indian government's one-sided views on the border issue on China.

The speakers also unanimously pointed out that the current tense situation on the Sino-Indian border was created entirely by the Indian side. The Indian government should adopt a wise attitude, immediately take measures to withdraw its military and administrative personnel who have crossed the border, restore the long-existing status quo of the border between the two countries, and ease the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border.

Zhao Zukang, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that in his letter to Premier Zhou, Nehru regarded the so-called McMahon Line, which was illegally manufactured by British imperialism in its aggression against our country, as the "tradition" for demarcating the Sino-Indian border, and unilaterally forced China to accept it. Obviously, Prime Minister Nehru's position is contrary to the Five Principles, and we firmly oppose it. Zhao Zukang said: The conspiracy of a small group of people in India with ulterior motives will only be severely condemned by peace-loving people all over the world.

Chen Wangdao, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, pointed out that Indian expansionists are deliberately provoking the friendly relations between China and India, slandering our country for carrying out "aggression," and even demonstrating in front of our embassy and insulting our national leaders. This provocative behavior has aroused great indignation in our intellectual circles.

Zhou Gucheng, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, emphasized in his speech that we uphold Sino-Indian friendship and we respect the Five Principles, but we will never tolerate anyone occupying our territory in any name.

Jin Zhonghua, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said that we want to advise Mr. Nehru not to inherit the legacy of the British imperialist policy of aggression. This is a very disgraceful thing, which is neither beneficial to the Indian people nor to Sino-Indian friendship. Creating tension on the Sino-Indian border issue will only fall into the trap of the right-wing reactionaries and fall into the trap set by the imperialists, because the intention of these imperialists and reactionaries is to provoke Sino-Indian relations.

Tan Qixiang, director of the Department of History at Fudan University and a historian, cited many historical facts at the meeting to illustrate that the so-called "McMahon Line" was only a product of Britain's implementation of an aggressive policy against the Tibet region of China, and has never been the border line between China and India. Tan Qixiang said that Prime Minister Nehru said that this boundary line "naturally follows" the peaks of the Himalayan Mountains. This is untenable. There are many borders in the world that do not conform to natural boundaries. Tan Qixiang said that now the Indian government is trying to force us to accept the "McMahon Line" manufactured by British imperialism, which cannot but make the people of the whole country feel extremely indignant. We want to solemnly tell the Indian authorities: Doing so will not bring any beneficial results to India, except that it is beneficial to imperialism.

Zhang Huiwen, professor of international law at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, listed various bases of international law from the perspective of international law, and refuted Nehru's absurd claim that the so-called "McMahon Line" is the boundary line between China and India. He said: Whether in his speech in parliament or in his conversations with reporters, Nehru emphasized that the "McMahon Line" has a legal basis, but in fact, the "Simla Treaty," which Nehru holds as the legal basis of the "McMahon Line," is fundamentally illegal. As everyone knows, the Chinese representative refused to sign at the Simla Conference. At that time, the Chinese government also repeatedly denied this treaty, so this treaty could not be established at all.

Feng Depei, vice president of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: The Chinese people attach great importance to the friendship between China and India. I believe that the Indian people also attach importance to the friendship between China and India, and will never allow a few expansionists to undermine the friendship between the people of our two countries.

Wu Yaozong, chairman of the National Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, said: Imperialism is elated by the tense situation created by India and praises the actions of Indian reactionaries as "correct." Isn't this worthy of Mr. Nehru's vigilance? The Indian people have long suffered from imperialism. Could what imperialism likes be of any benefit to the Indian people?

Shen Han, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Haobo, deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Wu Tegong, director of the Shanghai Municipal Ethnic Affairs Commission, and Chi Song, president of the Shanghai Buddhist Association and abbot of Jing'an Temple, stated in their speeches that they firmly support Premier Zhou's report and will never allow India to impose its one-sided views on the Sino-Indian border on our country. The symposium will continue tomorrow.

    北京上海各界人士讨论中印边界问题
    同声斥责印度猖狂反华活动
    一致支持我国政府严正立场
    北京
    新华社12日讯　北京市第三届第二次人民代表大会和市政协第二届委员会在今天分别举行的小组会议上，一致热烈拥护我国政府对中印边界问题所持的严正立场，同时谴责印度某些人士掀起的猖狂的反华活动。
    曾经到过中印边界的市政协委员、中国农工民主党成员、交通部水运规划设计院总工程师翟维沣说：“中国和印度克什米尔接壤的那块地方，人民的语言、风俗、习惯和建筑，完全和中国西藏的一样，和印度大大不同。那里的人民，历史上就是中国的公民，而印度出版的地图，却把这里的很大一部分土地划在印度的版图之内。1958年9月，并有印度军队十五人，侵入这个地区的大红柳滩，明明是印度侵犯中国领土，而印度政府却污蔑中国侵占印度土地，这不是颠倒黑白吗？中国人民决不容许这种不讲理的态度”。市人民代表、北京大学地质地理系教授侯仁之代表说：所谓中印边界问题，都是英帝国主义者一手造成的，是它的侵略政策的产物。奇怪的是，摆脱了英帝国主义的统治而独立了的印度，竟然继承英帝国主义的衣钵，把当初连英国人自己都不敢明目张胆承认的一条非法的麦克马洪线当作法宝，向已经站了起来的中国人民挑衅。印度军队和行政人员甚至还越过了他们所谓的麦克马洪线，侵入了我国的领土，还反而诬蔑我们是“侵略者”。更加荒唐的是尼赫鲁总理还居然替所谓麦克马洪线辩护，说什么这条线在地理上“适巧有一个优点”，因为它是一道“明显的分水岭。”如果说凭一条分水岭就可以作为一个地理上的“优点”来改变国界，那么当前世界上真不知道有多少相邻的国家要重新划分他们的国界了，这个论点显然是站不住脚的。侯仁之说，我们要警告印度当局，你们在中印边境问题上的这种无理态度，只会有利于帝国主义，而极端不利于印度自己和中印友谊。市政协委员、曾经在印度国际大学教过三年书的民盟中央委员、中央美术学院教授常任侠说：中国和印度，有着几千年的友好历史，从未发生过边疆国界问题。英帝国主义者为了向我国的西藏扩张，使用政治阴谋，划出了所谓麦克马洪线，而印度今天竟想承袭英帝遗留下来的这种可耻的侵略计划，强加在我们身上，这是肯定不能实现的。英帝国主义是中国和印度共同的敌人，印度忘记了昨天受压迫的日子，今天又要承袭帝国主义的衣钵来压迫我们，这是完全不应该的。长辛店机车车辆工厂工会主席、“二七”老工人杭宝华说，站起来了的中国人民，是绝对不能承认英国帝国主义阴谋划出的麦克马洪线的。中国没有一点向外“侵略”的企图，这是世界人民都公认的，印度侵占了中国的领土，反而诬蔑说中国侵略，真是颠倒是非、无理取闹。市人民代表、中德友好人民公社傅宗昆说：我们公社全体社员对印度侵占我国的领土非常气愤。大家认为印度某些别有用心的人，企图把非法的麦克马洪线强加于我国，这是解放了的中国人民、全体公社社员所不能容忍的。我们要求印度政府马上回到五项原则上来，通过协商解决两国边境问题。

    新华社上海12日电　在政协上海市委员会今天为讨论中印边界问题举行的扩大会议上，发言的人一致坚决拥护和支持我国政府处理中印边界问题的严正立场和一贯采取的方针；对印度某些政界人士继西藏叛乱事件后又一次别有用心地掀起的反华活动，表示极大的愤慨。对印度政府颠倒黑白、毫无根据地指责我国，并在军事、外交和舆论方面对我国施加压力，企图把印度政府关于边界问题的片面主张强加于中国的无理行为提出抗议。
    发言的人还一致指出：这次中印边境的紧张局势是印度方面一手造成的。印度政府应当采取明智的态度，立即采取措施，撤回越境的军事和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况，使中印边境的紧张局势缓和下来。
    民革上海市委员会主任委员赵祖康说，尼赫鲁在给周总理的信中，把英国帝国主义侵略我国非法制造的所谓麦克马洪线作为划分中印边界的“传统”，而片面地强迫中国接受。显然，尼赫鲁总理的立场是违背五项原则的，我们是坚决反对的。赵祖康说：印度一小撮别有用心的人的阴谋，只会受到全世界爱好和平人民的严厉谴责。
    民盟上海市委员会主任委员陈望道指出，印度扩张主义分子处心积虑地挑拨中印两国的友好关系，污蔑我国进行“侵略”，还向我国大使馆示威，辱骂我国家领导人。这种挑衅行为，已经引起我国知识界的极大愤慨。
    农工民主党上海市委员会主任委员周谷城在发言中强调指出，我们维护中印友谊，我们尊重五项原则，但是我们决不能容忍任何人以任何名义侵占我国的领土。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会主席金仲华说，我们要忠告尼赫鲁先生，千万不要承受英帝国主义侵略政策的遗产，这是非常不光彩的东西，既不利于印度人民，也不利于中印友谊。在中印边界问题上制造紧张局势，只会掉入右派反动分子阴谋的陷阱，落入帝国主义者布置的圈套，因为这些帝国主义和反动派的企图，就是要挑拨中印关系。
    复旦大学历史系主任、历史学家谭其骧在会上列举许多历史事实，说明所谓“麦克马洪线”只是英国对中国西藏地方施行侵略政策的产物，从来就不是中印两国的国界线。谭其骧说，尼赫鲁总理说：这条界线正好是沿着喜马拉雅山脉峰顶走的“天然分界线”，这是站不住脚的，世界上国境线不符合于天然分界线的多得很。谭其骧说，现在印度政府企图强迫我们接受英帝国主义制造的“麦克马洪线”，这不能不使我全国人民感到极大的愤慨。我们要正告印度当局：你们这样做除了有利于帝国主义以外，绝对不会得到什么有利于印度的结果。
    上海社会科学院国际法教授张汇文从国际法的观点列举国际法的各种根据，逐条驳斥了尼赫鲁硬说所谓“麦克马洪线”是中印分界线的无稽之谈。他说：尼赫鲁不论在议会发言和对记者的谈话中，都强调“麦克马洪线”具有法律根据，但是，事实上尼赫鲁持为“麦克马洪线”法律根据的“西姆拉条约”本身就是根本不合法的。世人皆知，在西姆拉会议上中国代表拒绝了签字。当时中国政府也再三否认这一条约，所以这个条约根本不能成立。
    中国科学院上海分院副院长冯德培说：中国人民非常重视中印两国的友谊，我相信印度人民也是重视中印友谊的，绝不会让少数扩张主义分子破坏我们两国人民之间的友谊。
    全国基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席吴耀宗说：帝国主义对由于印度一手造成的紧张局势兴高采烈，大夸印度反动派作法“正确”，这难道不值得尼赫鲁先生警惕吗？印度人民长期吃过帝国主义的苦头，难道帝国主义喜欢的东西，会对印度人民有什么好处吗？
    上海市总工会副主席沈涵、共青团上海市委副书记张浩波、上海市民族事务委员会主任伍特公和上海佛教协会会长、静安寺主持持松法师等在会上发言中都表示坚决拥护周总理的报告，绝不允许印度把关于中印边界的片面主张强加于我国。座谈会明天还将继续举行。
