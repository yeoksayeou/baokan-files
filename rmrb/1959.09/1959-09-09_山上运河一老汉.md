    Old Man on the Mountain Canal
    Gu Lei

      How deeply has the "Mountain Canal" taken root in the hearts of the people of Gansu? How much power has it brought to the people? What kind of changes has it caused in people's lives? Song Hushan can answer all of this. This old man in his sixties, stroking his silver-white beard, said to others with a smile: "I am determined to stay here until the canal is finished. I will build the canal well with everyone, and it will provide for my old age!"
    Someone asked him:
    "Grandpa Song, why did you come too?"
    "I came! I came so that Huining will no longer have ten years of drought in nine years, or two disasters in three years. I came for a year of hard work and ten thousand years of happiness. I came so that there will be no more like the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, understand! Children, you have seen too little!"
    So, this sixty-one-year-old man began to narrate his life, showing the young people a path from suffering to happiness.
    "I lived through the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. You don't know, those were not days for humans. It's scary to think about it!"
    What a terrible memory that year's drought left in the hearts of the people of Gansu! In 1928, not a single drop of rain fell all year. In the first half of 1929, there was still not a trace of clouds in the clear sky. Not a single grain was left on the ground, and all the grass withered. "Famine years fear the beginning, not the end." In the spring of 1929, the whirlwind of great famine rose, sweeping across the entire Gansu. Huining, this place with ten years of drought in nine years, became a big fire pit in the drought-stricken area, a deep abyss of disaster! People were suffering in the face of death. At this time, Song Hushan was thirty-one years old, and even if he had a thousand pounds of strength, he couldn't earn a bowl of rice!
    People first ate tree bark and grass roots…. They took out the leather halters and harnesses used for livestock, and the leather flails used for threshing. They didn't have time to cook them, so they burned them on the fire and ate them! They ate buckwheat husks, bean coats, and chaff, and their faces were swollen! Many families had no choice but to separate their families and flee for their lives. Song Hushan's family of six was scattered, and he went alone to escape death.
    He ran to Qin'an, Tongwei, and Dingxi, but there were no good years anywhere, and everywhere was a scene of death. On the road, he dared not raise his eyes to look around. On both sides of the road lay people who had starved to death, and no one buried them. Some people who were about to die lay on the side of the road moaning, their ears, noses, eyes, and mouths were covered with flies and crawling with maggots. The people walking on the road were skinny, their eyes were sunken, and they swayed as they walked, falling down and unable to get up.
    When the five-star red flag was raised in his hometown, Song Hushan was already fifty-one years old.
    The landlords were overthrown, and the people straightened their backs. The Party and the government cared about everyone's lives, led everyone to work hard to increase production, and led the people to take the socialist road. In 1956, the whole county mobilized to build Guanshanchuan and open canals to divert water, and he signed up. He worked on this project for two years. He recalled the situation at that time and said to others:
      "Don't look at me being old, I don't know what it means to be tired. It's all red clay, and it can't be dug down. I thought of a method. Twelve people stand in a row, and the hoes rise and fall together. This way, the vibration surface is large, and what is dug down is as big as a kang. I call this the 'collective strong attack method'. I even received an award for this!"
    In the two years of labor in Guanshanchuan, Song Hushan never missed a day of work. When the project was completed, he received three awards and became a model for water conservancy construction.
    One day in April 1958, Song Hushan was picking up manure. A young man ran over and said to him happily:
    "Grandpa Song, have you heard? Our province is mobilizing everyone to divert the Tao River to Dongzhi!"
    "I'm afraid it's not true, right? Separated by big mountains, big rivers, and big gullies, how can it be diverted! You always say nonsense, go pick up manure properly!" Song Hushan said suspiciously.
    "It's true. It is said that the land in our county can be irrigated too!"
    Many people signed up to divert the Tao River. Song Hushan's heart brightened. He said to everyone he met: "This is a great happy event, with water there will be good days, everyone go!" He ran to the commune to find the director.
    "Director, this is a great happy event, with water there will be good days, let me go divert the Tao River!"
    "No, Grandpa Song, the construction site doesn't want old people," the director said.
    Song Hushan returned home, his heart still unwilling. Before dawn, he ran to the township and found the township head, and the first thing he said was:
    "I want to go to the Tao River."
    "I'm afraid you can't do that work."
    "Township head, I'm saying it first, you call me to go and I'll go, if you don't call me to go, I'll go, I'm determined to go. You say I'm old, why did you call me to work in Guanshanchuan for two years? I have also earned credit, and now you don't want me!"
    Finally, the township head and the township general branch secretary discussed it and agreed to Song Hushan's request, and gave him three yuan from the township as travel expenses. Song Hushan returned home, fried thirty catties of oat noodles, and set off with them on his back. The township general branch secretary saw Song Hushan off.
    "Grandpa Song, bring the Tao River back!"
    "Guaranteed, I will definitely bring sweet water to our county."
    Song Hushan was moved to tears when he arrived at the Tao River diversion construction site. Tens of thousands of people were on the construction site, and everywhere was a scene of songs and laughter. It is said that more than 100,000 people have gone to the entire Tao River diversion construction site, and there are still more people signing up! Song Hushan felt that his whole body was full of strength, as if he had returned to his prime.
    He came to the Moshigou construction site of the Third Brigade of the Huining Work Zone. The entire construction section was stone work, hitting hammers and holding chisels. Song Hushan picked up a hammer and started working. He held the chisel and hit the hammer, doing all kinds of work. Among a pile of young people, on the red hills, Song Hushan's silver beard fluttered in the wind, and his tall figure rose and fell with the rise and fall of the sledgehammer, the sound of the hammer hitting in harmony with his shouts.
    Later, the party general branch secretary talked to him and asked him to go to the kitchen to handle food. At that time, the kitchen was full of young men who had never cooked before, and the food they made was either raw or hard. As soon as Song Hushan arrived in the kitchen, he studied with everyone and proposed to ensure that everyone ate well, drank well, and spent less money. He mobilized everyone to think of ways and also create new tools like the construction site. Some people were not at ease, feeling that it was not glorious to cook and make meals. Others were blasting rocks and opening rivers on the mountain, while they were sitting in the kitchen doing this, getting tired and not getting any credit. Song Hushan said to them: "You must not underestimate this matter. People are iron, and food is steel. If you don't eat well, you can't open the river. The handle of the knife is in our hands!"
    Since Song Hushan arrived in the kitchen, things changed. Six cleans appeared in the kitchen: clean cutting boards, clean floors, clean dining areas, clean cooks' hands, faces, and clothes. Eight goods appeared: noodles rolled well, boiling water boiled well, steamed buns steamed well, rice cooked well, good work attitude, good hygiene, good taste of dishes, and good contact with local commune members. He also took the lead in creating stoves, saving labor time and improving the efficiency of cooking. They did not eat the same meal twice in a week. They did it. The kitchen door was covered with big-character posters praising them.
    Song Hushan's experience embodies the past and present of the people of Gansu. Can't we see the spirit of the people of Gansu conquering nature from him?

    山上运河一老汉
    顾雷
      “山上运河”，究竟在甘肃人民的心底，扎了多深的根？究竟给人们带来多大的力量？究竟在人民的生活中引起了什么样的变化？这一切啊，宋虎山全都答得出来。这位年过六十的老人，抚着银白的胡须，笑容满面地对别人说：“我下定决心留在这里，一直到把河开完，我和大伙一起把河开好，它给我养老！”
    有人问他：
    “宋爷，你怎么也来了？”
    “来了！我是为了会宁不再有十年九旱、三年两灾来的，是为了一年苦战、万年幸福来的，是为了不再有民国十八年来的，懂么！孩子，你们经见的少啊！”
    于是，这位六十一岁的老人，开始叙说自己的一生，给年青人展示了一条由苦难走向幸福的路。
    “民国十八年，我过过，你们不知道，那不是人过的日子，想起来怕人哪！”
    那年的旱灾，在甘肃人民的心里，留下了多么可怕的记忆！1928年，整年没有下一滴雨。1929年上半年，晴空中还是没有一丝云彩。地面上，一颗粮食没有留下，草都全部枯死了。“荒年怕头不怕尾”，1929年春天，大饥饿的狂风刮起了，席卷整个甘肃。会宁，这十年九旱的地方成了干旱地区的大火坑，是灾难的深渊啊！人们在死亡的面前煎熬着。这时，宋虎山三十一岁，身上纵有千百斤气力，也是挣不到一碗饭吃啊！
    人们先吃树皮、草根……。拿出牲口用的皮笼头、皮套子、打场用的皮连枷，来不及煮，放在火上烧一烧吃掉！吃荞麦皮、豆衣子、糠，脸都肿了！许多人家，不得不骨肉分离，各自逃生去了。宋虎山全家六口人跑散了，他孤身一人去躲避死亡。
    他跑到秦安、通渭、定西，到处没有好年景，到处是一片死亡。路上，他不敢抬眼张望。路的两旁躺着饿死了的人，没有人去埋葬。有一些即将死去的人，躺在路边呻吟，耳朵、鼻子、眼睛、嘴里落满了苍蝇，爬满了蛆。在路上走着的人，瘦骨嶙嶙，眼睛都陷了下去，一边走一边晃，倒下去就爬不起来。
    当乡里升起五星红旗的那年，宋虎山已经五十一岁了。
    地主被打倒了，人民伸直了腰。党、政府，关怀大家的生活，领导大家努力提高生产，领导人民走社会主义道路。1956年，全县动员修关山川，开渠道引水，他跑去报了名。他在这个工程上干了两年。他回忆着那时候的情形对别人说：
      “别看年纪大，不知什么叫累呀。都是红胶土，挖不下来，我想了个法，十二个人站成一排，镢头同起同落，这样震动面大，挖下的有炕那么大，我管这叫‘集体猛攻法’，为这个还受过奖呢！”
    在关山川的两年劳动过程里，宋虎山没有旷过工。工程完工了，他受了三次奖，成了修水利的模范。
    1958年4月的一天，宋虎山正在拾粪。一个小伙子跑来乐哈哈地对他说：
    “宋爷，听说没有，咱省动员大家把洮河引到董志呢！”
    “怕不是真的吧？隔着大山、大河、大沟，怎么引法！你尽说些瞎话，好好拾粪去吧！”宋虎山怀疑地说。
    “是真的，说是还可以把咱县上的地都灌上水呢！”
    许多人都报名去引洮河。宋虎山的心里亮堂了。逢人便说：“这是大喜事，都去吧！”他跑到社里找主任去了。
    “主任，是大喜事啊，有水就有好日子，让我去引洮河吧！”
    “不行，宋爷，工地上不要年纪大的。”主任说。
    宋虎山回到家里，心还不死。天还没有亮，他跑到乡上，找到乡长，开口第一句就说：
    “我要去洮河。”
    “怕你干不了那个活。”
    “乡长，话先说下了，你叫去我也去，不叫去我也去，去定了。说我老了，为什么叫我在关山川干了二年？我也挣下过功劳，现在不要我了！”
    最后，乡长和乡总支书记商量了一下，答应了宋虎山的请求，并且从乡上支了三块钱给他作路费。宋虎山回到家，炒了三十斤油麦面，背着上路了。乡总支书记给宋虎山送行。
    “宋爷，带着洮河回来啊！”
    “保险啦，一定给咱县引来甜水。”
    宋虎山到了引洮工地，感动的流泪了。几万人在工地上，到处是一片歌声和笑声。听说，全引洮工地已上到十几万人，报名人还多着呢！宋虎山觉得周身都是力气，似乎已回到壮年了。
    他来到会宁工区三大队磨石沟工地。全工段都是石工活，打锤，扶钎子。宋虎山抄起一把锤就干上了。他又扶钎子又打锤，什么活都干。在一堆年青人中间，在红红的山岗上，宋虎山银色的胡须在风中飘着，高大的身影随着大锤的起落一起一伏，锤击的响声和着他的叫声。
    后来，党总支书记找他谈话，让他到厨房里去办伙食。当时，厨房里都是年青小伙子，没有做过饭，做出来的饭不是生的，就是硬的。宋虎山一到厨房，就和大家一块研究，提出要保证让大家吃好、喝好、花钱少。他发动大家想办法，也要和工地一样创造新工具。有些人不安心，觉得烧火做饭不光彩，人家在山上炸石头，开河，自己坐在伙房里干这个事，挨了累不落好。宋虎山给他们说：“万不能小看这事，人是铁，饭是钢，吃不好饭，开不了河，刀把子在咱们手里呢！”
    自从宋虎山到了厨房，样子变了。厨房里出现了六净：案板净、地下净、饭场净、炊事员手、脸、衣服净；出现了八好：面条擀的好，开水烧的好，馍馍蒸的好，米饭做的好，工作态度好，卫生搞的好，菜的味道好，和当地社员联系好。他又带头创造灶具，节省了劳动时间，提高了做菜饭的效率，一周内不吃重样饭。他们做到了。厨房门前，贴满了表扬他们的大字报。
    宋虎山的经历体现着甘肃人民的过去和现在；从他的身上，岂不是可以看到甘肃人民征服大自然的精神吗？
