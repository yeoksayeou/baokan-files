Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st. The Shenyang Water Pump Factory, which is rushing to produce coal mining and agricultural machinery, exceeded its August production value, output, and new product trial production plans by four days on the 27th. The comparable product cost in August was reduced by 11% compared to July; the quality was significantly improved, and the rejection rate was reduced by 22.6% compared to July.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the workers of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory held meetings and discussions, put forward competition initiatives and guarantee conditions, and resolved to respond to the great call of the Party with practical actions to better complete the production plan. Workers in Group 1 and 2 of the Second Workshop proposed specific indicators for improving production efficiency and initiated a competition among all employees. They then launched a more enthusiastic "opponent" competition, vigorously engaged in technical innovation, and fully utilized the capacity of the equipment, so that the production efficiency of the two groups was doubled, the work produced was of high quality, and defective products were eliminated. Lu Shizi, Bi Zhonggui, and Han Qisheng, who shared a machine tool, cooperated with each other and helped each other, constantly improving their operating methods during the processing, increasing production efficiency by 30%. Chen Zhixin, a worker in the Fourth Workshop, who had previously been unable to complete the plan for processing water turbines, used two advanced blade-cutting experiences on the night shift of the 26th, and completed 160% of the daily plan in one fell swoop.

Now, all the employees of this factory are advancing victoriously and have already started to implement the September plan.

    沈阳水泵厂按九月份计划开始行动
    新华社沈阳31日电　正在赶制采煤、农田机械的沈阳水泵厂，在27日提前四天超额完成了8月份的生产总值、产量和新产品试制计划。8月份可比的产品成本比7月份降低了11％：质量显著提高，废品率比7月份降低了22.6％。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，沈阳水泵厂的工人们纷纷集会座谈，提出竞赛倡议和保证条件，决心以更好地完成生产计划的实际行动响应党的伟大号召。二车间一、二两班的工人提出提高生产效率的具体指标，向全厂职工倡议开展竞赛。他们随即更加热烈地展开了你追我赶的“对手”竞赛，大搞技术革新，充分发挥设备的能力，使两个班的生产效率双双提高，做出的活件件优质，消灭了废品。共同使用一台机床的吕世滋、毕重贵、韩其胜三人，互相协作，互相帮助，在加工过程中不断地改进操作方法，使生产效率提高30％。四车间工人陈志新，过去加工水轮往往不能完成计划，26日夜班，他综合利用了两种吃刀的先进经验，一跃完成日计划160％。
    现在，这个工厂全体职工正在乘胜猛进，已经开始执行9月份的计划了。
