Small Warship Shows Great Power
    ——Watching the Dragon Lake Naval Model Competition
    By Our Correspondent　伊心恬 (Yī Xīntián)
    On the morning of the 18th, Dragon Lake in the south of Beijing was bathed in brilliant sunshine, its silver waves shimmering, with colorful flags reflected in the lake, vibrant and dazzling. The radio-controlled warship competition began here.
    The announcer's voice came from the competition platform: "The missile destroyer of the People's Liberation Army team is now setting sail." The eyes of thousands of spectators in the stands immediately focused in one direction. A fully equipped warship model, more than ten feet long, left the launching platform and sailed forward.
    The small warship sailed through the waves, heading straight along the course, turning, circling the buoys in a figure-eight pattern, reversing, and continuing forward. Suddenly, two balloons rose one after another from the small warship, slowly ascending, with long banners hanging from the balloons that read "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party" and "Long Live Chairman Mao," fluttering in the wind.
    Amidst the enthusiastic applause of the audience, the small warship returned, turning its head and approaching the launching platform. At this time, the referee announced that they were preparing to do additional maneuvers. Xu Jiakai, the representative of the People's Liberation Army team standing at the radio control console, pressed various buttons, manipulating the small warship to perform various actions. First, beautiful music was heard from the small warship, and the main mast flag, the aft mast flag, the duty flag, the identification signal flag, and the colorful flags celebrating National Day were raised one after another. The anchor lights, mast lights, signal lights, missile working lights, and torpedo working lights also shone brightly one by one. Small motorboats and small sampans were automatically lowered and raised again... all these actions were done quickly and realistically.
    "Release the combat alert!" The referee issued the order like a naval commander. As soon as the words were spoken, the small warship sounded a "doo...doo...doo" alarm, and the combat alert flag was also raised. The various combat weapons on the warship, such as radar, cannons, missiles, rockets, and torpedoes, successively performed upward and downward aiming, rotation, and launch, as if people were watching a warship exercise at sea.
    At this time, the announcer shouted: "Lake referees, please pay attention! We are now going to launch missiles, please pay attention to safety." The audience burst into laughter, but with the command "Launch missiles against the enemy!" a large missile on the small warship shot out of the launcher like an arrow in an instant, swept across the sky, making a hissing sound, with a plume of smoke trailing behind. People's eyes followed the missile forward, the missile shot straight to the lakeside two hundred meters away and landed, and applause immediately erupted.
    The small warship's eight anti-aircraft missiles, anti-submarine missiles, homing torpedoes, depth charges, rockets, and shells were launched into the sky one after another, flying towards the water surface. People looked up and saw that after the anti-submarine missile was launched into the sky, a parachute suspended a torpedo, plunged straight into the lake, tracking its prey, as if there really was a submarine at the bottom of the lake. One by one, small fish-like torpedoes skimmed across the water, speeding forward, and suddenly there was a "bang," as if they had hit the target. Three consecutive sounds of "bang! bang! bang!" came from the lake, and three whirlpools appeared on the surface of the water, which was the explosion of the depth charges. The small warship also performed actions such as releasing smoke screens, laying mines, sounding electric bells, and firing red and green signal flares, and did not end until after performing one hundred and eighty-seven actions.
    When the warship model, which was more than ten feet long, was performing its actions, the contestants could not stand on it, nor was there any connecting wire, and it was entirely controlled remotely by radio.

    小军舰大显威风
    ——看龙潭湖航海模型竞赛
    本报记者　伊心恬
    18日上午，北京城南的龙潭湖阳光灿烂，银波掩映，湖里荡漾着彩旗倒影，鲜艳缤纷。无线电操纵的舰船竞赛在这里开始举行。
    竞赛台传出了播音员的声音：“解放军代表队的导弹驱逐舰现在启航了”，看台上千百观众的目光立刻射向一个方向。一艘一丈多长的装备齐全的军舰模型，离开了放航台，向前驶去。
    小军舰乘风破浪，沿着航道直驶，转向，按浮标绕八字圈，后退，继续前进。突然，在小军舰上，先后升起了两个气球，徐徐上升，气球上吊着“中国共产党万岁”，“毛主席万岁”长幅标语，迎风飘扬。
    在观众的热烈鼓掌中，小军舰返航了，只见它调转头，驶靠放航台。这时，裁判员宣布，准备做增加动作。站在无线电控制台前的解放军代表队选手许家凯，按动着各种电钮，操纵着小军舰表演各种动作。先是在小军舰上传出了优美的音乐，主桅旗、后桅旗、值日旗、识辨信号旗、庆祝国庆的彩旗都先后升起来了。锚灯、桅灯、信号灯、导弹工作灯、鱼雷工作灯也一一放出亮光；小汽艇、小舢舨自动放下又升起……这些动作都做得敏捷、逼真。
    “放战斗警报”！裁判员就像海军指挥员一样，发出了命令。话音刚落，小军舰响起了嘟……嘟……嘟的警报声，随着，战斗警报旗也升起来了。军舰上的雷达、大炮、导弹、火箭、鱼雷等各种战斗武器，先后表演了上仰、下俯、旋回、发射，人们好像在海上看军舰演习一样。
    这时播音员在喊叫：“湖上裁判员请注意！现在要发射导弹啦，请你们注意安全。”观众一阵哄笑，但是随着“对敌导弹发射！”一声号令，只见小军舰上一个最大的导弹，霎时像射箭一样飞出了发射架，掠过天空，发出嘶……的喷气声音，尾巴喷出一股浓烟，人们的目光紧跟着导弹前进，导弹直射到两百米外的湖畔落下，顿时掌声四起。
    小军舰的八个对空导弹、防潜（水艇）导弹、自导鱼雷、深水炸弹、火箭和炮弹都先后射向天空，飞向水面。人们抬头看到，防潜（水艇）导弹射向天空后，降落伞吊着鱼雷，直入湖里，追踪猎物，好像湖底真的有潜水艇一样。一个个小鱼一样的鱼雷掠过水面，向前疾驶，突然“砰”的一声，好像击中目标了。湖上传来“砰！砰！砰！”连响三声，水面冒起三个漩涡，这是深水炸弹爆炸。小军舰还表演了放烟幕、抛水雷、响电铃，发红绿信号弹等动作，直到表演过一百八十七个动作才结束。
    一丈多长的军舰模型，在表演动作时，选手们无法站在上面，也没有任何牵线连系，完全靠无线电远距离操纵。
