    Create New Advertising Styles to Reflect the New Look of the Great Leap Forward
    The Ministry of Commerce Convenes Experience Exchange Meeting on Advertising, Window Dressing, and Merchandise Display

    (By our reporter) In order to utilize diverse and colorful advertising forms, improve commercial publicity work for National Day, and better serve production, consumption, and the beautification of cities, the Ministry of Commerce recently convened an experience exchange meeting on commercial advertising, window dressing, and merchandise display in Shanghai.

    To welcome the convening of the meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Commerce beautifully decorated the shop windows along Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road, attracting crowds of citizens who braved the scorching sun to admire them. The merchandise displays inside the shops were also arranged neatly and artistically, making it convenient for customers to shop and creating a clear and pleasant atmosphere. Ten major cities, including Beijing, Harbin, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, also presented ten performance windows reflecting local production characteristics for the meeting.

    These shop windows basically met the requirements of commercial advertising for being truthful, beautiful, practical, and economical, and they thoroughly implemented the Party and state policies and the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. The participating representatives conducted specific discussions and evaluations of all the shop windows, merchandise displays, and various advertisements, and selected ten shop windows from ten cities and thirty shop windows, merchandise displays, and silk-screen printed advertisements from twenty units in Shanghai as demonstration and promotion projects.

    During the meeting, everyone also visited the Shanghai Advertising, Window Display, and Merchandise Display Art Exhibition, which featured over three hundred exquisite prints, silk-screen prints, neon lights, slides, and advertising images of shop windows and merchandise displays. They also visited over three hundred advertising photos exhibited by the twenty participating cities. In particular, the exhibition of over one thousand advertising images exhibited at the Prague International Advertising Conference in December 1957, as well as over two hundred plastic window display items presented to China by Czechoslovakia, were well received by the participating representatives.

    At the meeting, everyone unanimously recognized that commercial advertising publicity should be combined with the Party's guidelines and policies and the Party's central tasks in each period to continuously improve the ideological and policy level of commercial advertising. The meeting also proposed that commercial advertising must implement the principle of running advertising diligently and thriftily. (Attached picture)

    这些橱窗基本上都符合商业广告真实、美观、适用、经济的要求，并且贯彻执行了党和国家政策和增产节约的精神。与会代表对所有的橱窗和商品陈列以及各种广告都一个个进行了具体讨论和鉴定，并推选出十个城市的十个橱窗和上海二十个单位的三十个橱窗、商品陈列和丝漆印广告，作为示范推广项目。

    会议上，大家一致认识到商业广告宣传应该跟党的方针政策和党每个时期的中心任务结合起来，以不断提高商业广告的思想水平和政策水平。会议还提出了商业广告必须贯彻勤俭办广告的方针。（附图片）
