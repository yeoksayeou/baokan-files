Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th - Inspired by the fighting call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the members of more than 1,200 people's communes in Henan Province have launched an unprecedentedly massive production upsurge. A province-wide movement to strive for overall overproduction of six major crops – grain, cotton, oilseeds, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and vegetables – is surging forward. Currently, 22,213,000 commune members across the province are participating in field management.

After more than 50 days of hard work, the agricultural front in Henan Province has already seized a bumper harvest of more than 18 million mu of early autumn grain crops from the hands of drought. Judging from the harvested crops, the yield in most areas has exceeded that of last year. Late autumn crops are generally growing well due to timely watering, topdressing, cultivation, and pest control, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

In the overproduction movement, various regions have firmly grasped the struggle against various natural disasters. Recently, more than 690,000 mu of sweet potatoes in Nanyang Prefecture were infested with "sesame worms." The entire prefecture immediately mobilized more than 400,000 people, led by the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, with cadres responsible for specific areas. After three days of encirclement and repeated sweeps, the pests have been completely eliminated. Now, the severely affected sweet potato seedlings have sprouted new shoots again. In Xinxiang Prefecture, which is rich in cotton production, more than 2 million cotton farmers have launched an all-out attack on cotton field pests in order to produce more autumn bolls and larger bolls. So far, the 1,129,000 mu of cotton fields affected by the third generation of bollworms in the prefecture have been treated once.

In areas where the drought has not been alleviated, people's ambition to overcome drought and ensure a bumper harvest is even stronger, inspired by the Party's fighting call. In the Shian Commune Jianhe Brigade, Xinye County, located in the hilly area, in order to overcome the difficulty of extreme water shortage and ensure that late autumn crops have enough water for overproduction, a water source survey team of more than 300 people was formed. As a result, 16 places where springs could be dug were found, and the water was brought to the hills. In Yangzhuang Production Brigade, Shezhen Commune, Nanyang County, more than 580 commune members dug a canal more than eight li long, finally allowing the Pan River water to flow through nine ditches and around seven villages to the 2,500 mu of autumn fields in Yangzhuang Village.

Ample water and fertilizer are the characteristics of this overproduction movement. As of the 4th, of the 18 million mu of sweet potatoes, which account for nearly half of the province's autumn crop yield, 13,860,000 mu had been topdressed, of which 13,850,000 mu had been irrigated with water to increase production. In Baofeng County, Xuchang Prefecture, in order to achieve the goal of increasing sweet potato yield by 500 to 1,000 jin per mu, the people's communes invested 188,000 laborers in fertilizer application every day. After three days of concentrated effort, 210,000 mu of sweet potatoes were universally topdressed once, and now the second topdressing has begun. Many communes in Yu County have also promoted the practice of irrigating sweet potato seedlings with water mixed with human manure to promote rapid weight gain of the tubers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th - The competitive upsurge in Shandong to seize late autumn overproduction is rising higher and higher. Big-character posters and pledges to create high yields, plant red flags, and dedicate practical actions to National Day are plastered all over the temporary field shelters. According to statistics from six areas including Jinan, Liaocheng, Heze, Changwei, Qingdao, and Linyi, the number of people participating in the field management of late autumn crops has increased from 7 million to more than 10 million. Many areas have proposed production increase targets to ensure that the total grain output for the year will increase by more than 20% above the original plan through the late autumn overproduction movement.

The province's farmers are seizing the last opportunity to increase the production of late autumn crops, racing against time and leaving no grain behind. The 3,380 basic accounting units of the communes in the Jinan area are mostly involved in the heated team competition. In recent days, they have been stepping up topdressing, weeding, lifting vines, and cultivating soil for sweet potatoes to ensure large and heavy tubers. The broad masses of commune members in Changwei and other prefectures are using the same energy they used in last year's great steelmaking campaign to topdress sweet potatoes and late corn, increasing the daily progress of topdressing in the area from 160,000 mu to 460,000 mu. The tens of thousands of red and expert activists who emerged since the Great Leap Forward have become locomotives and pacesetters in this overproduction movement. After studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they are even more invigorated, taking the lead and working hard. In Shou Zhang County, activists posted more than 40,000 big-character posters, like fierce tigers descending the mountain to fight in the fields. Here are the "Wu Song Team" and "Hua Mulan"; there are "Little Luo Cheng" and "Old Huang Zhong," everywhere are tense and enthusiastic competition scenes.

Driven by the activists, the broad masses of commune members are working hard, practically, and skillfully, greatly improving work efficiency and making field management more and more meticulous. The famous Iron Women's Company of the Zhudian Management Area of the Dongjiao Commune in Licheng County, in order to solve the contradiction of tight time, heavy tasks, and few people, manufactured their own weeding hoes to replace manual weeding, increasing work efficiency by more than five times. They also made four wooden frames for the four electric water pumps, raising the suction pipes off the ground, increasing the water output by more than 30%. In Yangji Commune, Huimin County, which is rich in cotton production, each production team ranked the cotton fields by block and managed them according to the different conditions of the cotton fields, with good results. In Dachen Commune, Shou Zhang County, there was a shortage of fertilizer transportation tools, so the commune members worked in shifts, resting people but not tools, accumulating 1.2 million jin of fertilizer in just three days, and most of it was transported to the fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th - Since the beginning of autumn, people's communes in various parts of Gansu have launched an agricultural competition movement to increase production by another 10% to 30% on the basis of the original targets. After the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was issued, this movement was pushed to a new climax. People's communes in various regions have increased their efforts, increased their targets, added measures, and focused on autumn field processing and other production activities.

The members of the people's communes in Wen County were in high spirits after studying and discussing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The county organized a total of 441 shock teams, afforesting 500,800 mu in five days, overfulfilling the original autumn afforestation plan. After that, the communes launched an agricultural overproduction movement, and all production teams formulated plans to increase actual production beyond the contracted output. More than 40,000 commune members, accounting for 83% of the county's labor force, formulated individual plans to exceed their labor quotas. In order to ensure the realization of the overproduction plan, the county, communes, and production teams established inspection and evaluation groups to check crop growth, check production increase measures, etc., and launched a continuous evaluation competition with evaluations from above and below, and cross-evaluations from left and right.

Shandan County held a broadcast conference attended by 250,000 people at the end of August. After the meeting, the members of the people's communes immediately threw themselves into the overproduction movement. The commune members who were harvesting spring wheat proposed to ensure fast harvesting, fast pulling, fast threshing, clean harvesting, clean pulling, and clean threshing, striving to harvest an extra 25 jin of wheat per mu. Farmers throughout the province are also adding water, adding fertilizer, and weeding more in the autumn fields, striving to harvest an extra 40 jin of autumn crops per mu on the basis of the original plan.

Preparations for a bumper harvest of summer crops next year have also begun. To date, the province has deeply plowed more than 1,490 mu of land and selected more than 150 million jin of seeds, both of which are faster and of better quality than last year.

    粮棉超产运动风起云涌
    河南、山东、甘肃加强田间管理　晚秋作物丰收在望
    据新华社郑州10日电　河南省一千二百多个人民公社的社员在八届八中全会的战斗号召鼓舞下，掀起了一个空前浩大的生产高潮。力争粮食、棉花、油料、烟叶、红薯、蔬菜等六大作物全面超产运动，正在全省范围内汹涌澎湃地展开。现在，全省参加田间管理的公社社员，已达到二千二百一十三万人。
    河南省农业战线经过五十多天的大干苦干，已经从干旱手里夺取了一千八百多万亩早秋粮食作物的丰收，从已经收打的情况看，大部分地区都超过了去年的产量。晚秋作物由于适时地进行了浇水、追肥、中耕和治虫，普遍生长良好，丰收在望。
    各地在超产运动中，狠狠地抓住了同各种自然灾害进行斗争。南阳专区各县最近有六十九万多亩红薯发生了“芝麻虫”，全区立即出动四十多万人，由各级党委书记亲自挂帅，干部分片包干，经过三天的全线围剿和反复扫荡，已经全部消灭干净。现在，受害严重的红薯秧，又重新发出了新芽。在盛产棉花的新乡专区，二百多万名棉农为了多座秋桃，座大桃，全面展开了向棉田虫害的总攻击。到目前为止，全区发生第三代棉铃虫的一百一十二万九千亩棉田，已经普治了一遍。
    在旱象尚未解除地区的人们，在党的战斗号召鼓舞下，战胜干旱、确保丰收的雄心，更加旺盛。处在岗岭地带的新野县施庵公社涧河大队的社员们，为了战胜水源极度缺乏的困难，使晚秋作物喝足超产水，组成了一支由三百多人参加的水源查勘队，结果找到了十六处可以下泉的地方，并且把水搬上了岗。南阳县赊镇公社杨庄生产大队五百八十多名社员，挖了一条八里多长的渠道，终于使潘河水穿过九条沟、绕过七个村庄，流到了杨庄村的两千五百多亩秋田里。
    水肥齐下，是这次超产运动的特点。到4日止，占全省秋季作物产量将近一半的一千八百多万亩红薯，已有一千三百八十六万亩施了追肥，其中一千三百八十五万亩浇了增产水。许昌专区的宝丰县各人民公社为了实现每亩红薯增产五百至一千斤的指标，每天投入施肥的劳力达十八万八千多人，经过三天的突击，就把二十一万亩红薯普施了一遍追肥，现在，又开始了第二遍追肥。禹县许多公社还推广了在红薯秧棵用水加人粪尿灌溉，促使薯块快速增重。
    据新华社济南12日电　山东各地夺取晚秋超产的竞赛热潮愈涨愈高，创高产，插红旗，以实际行动向国庆献礼的大字报、决心书，贴满了田间临时战棚。据济南、聊城、菏泽、昌潍、青岛、临沂等六个地区的统计，参加晚秋作物田间管理的人员，已由七百万人增加到一千万人以上。许多地区都提出了保证通过晚秋超产运动，使全年粮食总产量比原计划提高两成以上的增产指标。
    全省农民抓紧了晚秋作物最后的增产时机，分秒必争，一颗不让。济南地区各公社三千三百八十个基本核算单位，绝大部分都卷进了热火朝天的队际竞赛，连日来都在加紧给甘薯追肥，锄草、提蔓、培土，保证甘薯块大块重。昌潍等专区广大社员以去年大炼钢铁的劲头给甘薯和晚玉米追肥，全区追肥日进度由十六万亩提高到四十六万亩。在去年大跃进以来涌现的成千上万的红专积极分子，在这次超额运动中更成了火车头和标兵。他们学习了党的八届八中全会公报和决议以后，精神更加焕发，一马当先，领头大干。寿张县的积极分子张贴大字报四万多张，尤如猛虎下山，搬到田间鏖战。这里是“武松队”与“花木兰”；那里是“小罗成”与“老黄忠”，到处是紧张热烈的竞赛场面。
    广大社员在积极分子带动下，苦干实干和巧干，使工效大大提高，田间管理越做越细致。历城县东郊公社祝甸管理区有名的钢铁妇女连，为了解决时间紧、活计多、人手少的矛盾，自己制造了耘锄，代替人工锄草，工效提高五倍多；又给四部电动抽水机做了四个木架，把吸水管子架离地面，出水量提高30％以上。盛产棉花的惠民县杨集公社各生产队，给棉花逐块排队，针对棉田的不同情况进行管理，效果良好。寿张县打渔陈公社运肥工具不足，社员们就分班干活，歇人不歇工具，只三天就积肥一百二十万斤，并且大部分运到了地里。
    新华社兰州9日电　入秋以后，甘肃各地人民公社在原订指标基础上，开展了再增产一成到三成的农业竞赛运动。党的八届八中全会的伟大号召发出以后，更把这一运动推向了新的高潮。各地人民公社纷纷加干劲，增指标，添措施，大抓秋田加工等各项生产。
    文县各人民公社社员在学习和讨论了党的八届八中全会公报和决议后，意气风发。全县共组织四百四十一个突击队，在五天之内突击造林五十万零八千多亩，超额完成了原订的秋季造林计划。这以后，各公社又展开农业超产运动，所有生产队都制订了实产超包产的计划，占全县劳动力83％的四万多名社员都订出了劳动超定额的个人计划。为了保证实现超产计划，县、公社、生产队都成立了检查评比团，检查作物生长情况，检查增产措施等，展开了上下评，左右评，交叉评的连环评比竞赛。
    山丹县在8月底举行了有二十五万人参加的广播大会。会后，各人民公社社员立即投入了超产运动。正在收打春小麦的社员，提出要保证做到快收、快拉、快打，收净、拉净、打净，争取每亩小麦多收二十五斤。全省农民还在给秋田加水、加肥、多锄草，争取每亩秋田作物在原计划基础上，再多收四十斤。
    为争取明年夏收作物大丰收的准备工作也已展开。到目前止，全省已深翻地一千四百九十多亩，已选种一亿五千多万斤，都比去年进度快，质量好。
