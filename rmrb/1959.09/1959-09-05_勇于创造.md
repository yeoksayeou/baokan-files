Daring to Create

The survival of humanity and the progress of society are processes of struggle against difficulties. In the course of progress, difficulties are encountered at every moment. We Communists have never feared difficulties. The technical innovations in steelmaking and ironmaking by the Benxi Iron and Steel Company and the Beijing Special Steel Plant, published in today's newspaper, are the results of the factory's cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel using a spirit of daring to think and daring to act to overcome difficulties in every possible way.

"In every possible way" is said in relation to "overcoming difficulties." It is an excellent phrase to express the determination and perseverance of the Chinese working people in fighting difficulties with the spirit of "in every possible way" and daring to think and act.

Since the Great Leap Forward, many people who dare to think and dare to act have emerged on all fronts. They have overcome countless difficulties, created amazing miracles, and promoted the leap forward in production. This tells us a truth: promoting the spirit of daring to think and daring to act is a powerful force for overcoming difficulties. Difficulties will always exist, and the potential for subjective initiative is infinite. Overcoming difficulties unlocks potential, and our cause advances by leaps and bounds.

    勇于创造
    人类的生存，社会的前进，就是和困难作斗争的过程。在前进的途程中，每时每刻都会遇到困难。我们共产党人，从来不畏惧困难。今天本报发表的本溪钢铁公司和北京特殊钢厂在炼钢炼铁上的技术革新，就是厂的干部和工人及工程技术人员同志们，以敢想敢干的精神千方百计克服困难的成果。
    “千方百计”是对“克服困难”说的。用“千方百计”敢想敢干来表达我国劳动人民向困难作斗争的决心和毅力，是再好不过的一个词。
    大跃进以来，各个战线上涌现了不少敢想敢干的人物，他们排除了千难万难，创造了惊人的奇迹，推动了生产跃进。这就告诉我们一条真理，发扬敢想敢干的精神，是克服困难的顽强力量，困难会永远存在的，主观能动的潜力也是无穷无尽的，克服了困难就挖掘了潜力，我们的事业就大踏步前进。
