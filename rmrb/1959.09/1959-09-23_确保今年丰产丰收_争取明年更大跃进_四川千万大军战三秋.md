Chengdu, September 22nd (Reported by this newspaper) A vigorous autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting upsurge has been set off in Sichuan Province's rural areas amidst a booming production increase and frugality campaign. Farmers throughout the province are full of energy and high spirits, with a twenty million-strong army fighting on the thousand-mile basin, determined to ensure a bumper harvest this year and strive for a greater leap forward next year.

Sichuan Province's autumn harvest, which began with the harvesting of early autumn crops, is entering its most intense stage. Currently, many grains and cash crops such as corn, medium rice, peanuts, sorghum, and buckwheat and potatoes in mountainous areas have appeared on the scene one after another. The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have further inspired the farmers of the province and pushed the autumn harvest work to a new peak of rapid harvesting and good harvesting. The province's medium rice harvesting progress has rapidly increased from 500,000 to 600,000 mu per day to 700,000 to 800,000 mu. The speed of corn harvesting has also greatly accelerated. Mianyang, Deyang and other counties rushed to harvest medium rice in ten days, shortening the time by more than five days compared with last year. Luzhou Prefecture tightly linked harvesting, threshing, transportation, and storage, and medium rice was dried and put into storage immediately after harvesting. In order to ensure that no grain is lost, all localities are harvesting one piece of yellow and then harvesting another, implementing many effective measures such as mixing the barrel with a lid and enclosure, gently cutting and releasing, gently transferring, heavy beating, organizing children to pick up grain, and re-harvesting and re-beating. Fengjie County uses the threshing method to thresh medium rice, increasing work efficiency by two and a half times, basically achieving no spillage. Huili County improved the method of harvesting potatoes, reducing the spillage rate from more than 5% in previous years to 1%. By mid-September, more than 31 million mu of the province's 41 million mu of medium rice and single-season late rice had been harvested, accounting for 78.6% of the total area of ​​medium rice and single-season late rice; the harvest of 15 million mu of corn has reached more than 65%, and Neijiang, Wanxian, Leshan and other cotton-producing areas have harvested 31.48 million dan of seed cotton! Many areas of miscellaneous grains and minor crops have entered the final stage.

"The mixing bucket rings, the cattle go to the fields, the grain is harvested cleanly, and the fields are plowed," while rushing to harvest, various places generally adopted the method of harvesting and plowing at the same time to carry out autumn plowing in a timely manner. People excitedly sang: "Plowing the fields in July (lunar calendar) is like a bowl of oil, returning straw to the fields is promising, pounding the paddy fields and filling them with water, and taking it to the next level next year." At the same time, the fact that large-scale deep plowing last year promoted a bumper harvest this year has aroused the attention of the masses to deep plowing. Nanchong Prefecture proposed that one-third of the cultivated land for next year's spring crops should be deeply plowed to about one foot. Before the autumn harvest, a large number of plowing hands were trained, and the land was plowed with deep plows and old plows. Xichong County has plowed 80% of the paddy fields, most of which are seven inches to one foot deep. Longchang County, which suffered from severe drought, adopted the method of plowing the fields by pumping water from the river and plowing the fields by evenly distributing water without relying on the river, and carried out drought resistance and rush plowing. Most of the paddy fields have been deep plowed once. According to statistics from twelve prefectures (cities), the deep plowing area of ​​paddy fields alone has reached more than 11.8 million mu, accounting for more than half of the harvested area. In addition, the production plans for spring crops in various places have been mostly implemented to the team. Currently, they are actively carrying out seed census, replenishment of dryland deep plowing tools, and preparation of fertilizers. After several concentrated fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production campaigns, Nanchong, Jiangjin and many other prefectures have an average of more than 3,000 catties of fertilizer per mu of spring cultivated land; Yibin Prefecture has reached 10,000 catties. Rapeseed seedling cultivation has already started in full swing.

This year, the harvesting of autumn mature crops and the sowing of spring crops are concentrated in time, large in area, have many farm works, and have high requirements for specifications and quality. In addition, late autumn crops need to be managed, and rural labor is unprecedentedly tight. More than 5,000 people's communes in the province have made full use of the superiority of the commune, rationally arranged labor, and compressed non-production personnel, thereby ensuring that more than 80% of the labor force is invested in the agricultural front. The communes in Fushun County divided the work according to the specialties and labor strength of the members, and formed three armies for rushing to harvest, rushing to plow, and managing autumn fields. They set people, plots, time, and quality, and contracted to the end, layer by layer acceptance, and quickly harvested 180,000 mu of medium rice, and generally plowed and harrowed it more than once. The enthusiastic and intertwined cooperation between the high mountain areas and the plains areas, the communities that plant more and those that plant less, played a great role. In terms of material preparation, the people's communes also showed great power. Neijiang Prefecture lacked more than 4 million catties of pea and broad bean seeds, but it was quickly resolved through mutual cooperation and support. Since the beginning of autumn, the small farm tools repaired and rushed to manufacture by the iron and wood factories run by the people's communes throughout the province have reached more than 40 million pieces, ensuring that the needs of production are met in a timely manner.

"Hard work plus skillful work, human power surpasses the gods." In the competition for exceeding quotas, high work efficiency, and high quality, the broad masses of people offered suggestions and worked with their own hands, just as the masses themselves described: Thousands of hearts, thousands of hearts, all for the leap forward. The "Red Flag Bucket" competition launched in Langzhong County during the harvesting of medium rice, the mixing barrels chased after each other, improved labor organization, and improved harvesting technology, and work efficiency quickly increased by half to one times. Tool reforms in many places have rapidly ushered in a new situation. Mianyang Prefecture adopted methods such as refitting, rushing to manufacture, and repairing in various places, and promoted more than 14,000 threshers in a short period of time. Pengxi County took materials locally, relied on its own efforts, and carried out tool reforms on a mass scale. Since the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, it has built 180,000 deep digging hoes and a large number of deep plowing plows, which not only ensured that the county's paddy fields were plowed earlier than the same period last year, but also the quality was good. At present, many prefectures and counties in the province are holding on-site "Four Autumns" tool reform meetings to further promote various improved tools needed for autumn plowing and autumn planting.

    确保今年丰产丰收　争取明年更大跃进
    四川千万大军战三秋
    本报成都22日电　四川省农村在轰轰烈烈的增产节约竞赛中，掀起了热火朝天的秋收、秋耕、秋种热潮。全省农民干劲十足，斗志昂扬，两千万大军奋战在千里盆地上，决心确保今年丰产丰收，争取明年更大跃进。
    四川省秋收从早秋作物开始收割以来，正进入最紧张的阶段。目前，玉米、中稻、花生、高粱和山区的荞麦、洋芋等许多粮食和经济作物已相继登场。党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，更加鼓舞了全省农民，把秋收工作推向了快收、收好的新高峰。全省中稻抢收进度由每天五、六十万亩迅速上升到七、八十万亩，玉米收割速度也大大加快。绵阳、德阳等县十天就抢收完中稻，比去年缩短五天以上。泸州专区收、打、运、藏环环扣紧，中稻收下马上晒干入库。为了保证颗粒不丢。各地都是黄一片收一片，实行拌桶加盖加围、轻割轻放、轻传、重打、组织儿童拣粮，以及复收复打等许多行之有效的措施。奉节县用打场的办法打中稻，工效提高两倍半，基本上做到无抛撒。会理县改进收洋芋的办法，抛撒率由往年的5％以上下降到1％。到9月中，全省四千一百多万亩中稻和一季晚稻已收完三千一百多万亩，占中稻和一季晚稻总面积的78.6％；一千五百万亩玉米收获已达65％以上，内江、万县、乐山等产棉区已收籽棉三千一百四十八万担！杂粮和小宗作物许多地区已进入扫尾阶段。
    “拌桶响，牛下田，谷收净，田犁完”，在抢收同时，各地普遍采取边收、边犁的办法及时展开秋耕。人们兴奋高歌：“7月（农历）犁田一碗油，稻草还田有搞头，捶糊田坎关满水，明年更上一层楼”。同时去年大搞深翻地促进今年大丰收事实引起广大群众对深翻地的重视。南充专区提出明年小春作物耕地要有三分之一的面积深耕一尺左右，秋收前就训练了大批犁田手，用深耕犁和旧犁套耕等办法翻地，西充县已翻完80％的稻田，大部深度在七寸到一尺之间。遭受严重干旱的隆昌县采取靠河车水犁田，不靠河匀水犁田，展开抗旱抢耕，大部稻田已深翻一次。据十二个专区（市）统计，仅稻田深耕面积就已达一千一百八十多万亩，占已收获面积的一半多。此外，各地小春作物生产计划已大部落实到队。目前正积极进行种子普查、旱地深翻工具添补和肥料等项准备工作。南充、江津等许多专区经过几次突击积肥造肥运动，平均每亩小春耕地有肥三千斤以上；宜宾专区已达到一万斤。油菜育苗已经全面开始。
    今年秋熟作物收获和小春作物播种的时间集中、面积大、农活多、规格质量要求高，加上晚秋作物需要管理，农村劳力空前紧张。全省五千多个人民公社充分运用公社的优越性，合理安排劳动力，压缩非生产人员，从而保证了80％以上的劳力投入农业战线。富顺县各公社按社员特长和劳力强弱分工，组成抢收、抢耕、秋田管理等三路大军，定人、定地段、定时间、定质量，一包到底，层层验收，迅速把十八万亩中稻收完，并普遍犁耙一次以上。高山区和平坝区、种的多和种的少的社、队之间热情交织的大协作起了很大作用。在物质准备方面，人民公社也同样显示了巨大的威力。内江专区缺少豌豆，蚕豆种子四百多万斤，但经过互相协作支援，很快就全部解决。入秋以来，全省人民公社社办的铁木工厂整修和赶造的小农具已达四千多万件，保证了及时满足生产的需要。
    “苦干加巧干，人力赛神仙”。在超定额、高工效、高质量的竞赛中，广大群众人人献计，个个动手，正如群众自己所形容的：千条心，万条心，一心为跃进。阆中县在收割中稻中开展的“红旗桶”竞赛，拌桶与拌桶之间你追我赶，改进劳动组织，改进收打技术，工效迅速提高半倍到一倍以上。许多地方的工具改革迅速出现新的局面。绵阳专区各地采用改装、赶制、修补等办法，短期内就推广了一万四千多部打谷机。蓬溪县就地取材，自力更生，全民大搞工具改革，秋收、秋耕以来已打造出十八万深挖锄和大批深耕犁，不仅保证了全县稻田比去年同期提早翻完，而且质量也好。目前，全省许多专区和县正在召开“四秋”工具改革现场会，进一步推广秋耕、秋种需要的各种改良工具。　（于竞祁）
