Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have aroused enthusiastic reactions among women across the country. They are determined to respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy, and managing households diligently and frugally.

The female workers in industrial, handicraft, and service industries have seen a vigorous new atmosphere in production after studying the communique and resolutions.

The female workers of the Yizu group of the cotton yarn doffing team of the Beijing No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill originally lacked confidence in completing the task of 142 kilograms of yarn doffing per person per day. Now, they propose to guarantee the completion of 148 kilograms per person per day. The female workers of the Tianjin No. 1 State-owned Cotton Mill guarantee that this year's cotton yarn production will exceed the state plan by more than 2,800 pieces, and cotton cloth by 1.44 million meters. They also launched a friendly competition with the female workers of the Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill. The female workers of the Shanghai No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill propose to ensure the output of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and colored cloth in September and comprehensively improve product quality. The famous Yi Shijuan group of this factory proposed to increase production by an additional 28 pieces of cotton yarn in September beyond the plan. All the female workers of the Dalian Shipyard launched a heated production competition. The thirteen female workers in the tool workshop put forward thirty-five innovation suggestions in half a month, increasing production efficiency by one to four times. When female workers Gao Guizhi and Cui Yulan of this workshop were producing measuring spring washers, they came up with a multi-clamping method, which increased production from 95 pieces per day in the past to 720 pieces in five hours, with completely qualified quality.

Many street production organizations in Xichang'an Street, Beijing, put forward a plan of "working hard for thirty days and guaranteeing a doubling of production" at the leap forward conference held in response to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session. The female employees of the Huguosi Women's Store are determined to strive to always maintain the glorious title of Red Flag Store, and put forward the slogan of "the busier the task, the greater the enthusiasm, the more customers, the better the attitude." These days, the employees have cleaned the store more thoroughly and have a more enthusiastic attitude towards customers. The service staff of the Erlong Road Neighborhood Service Station recently took the initiative to go to residents' homes and factories to deliver and pick up clothes for washing, and added the business of washing cotton-padded items to meet seasonal needs, which greatly facilitated the residents. In order to allow the children's mothers to rest more and produce more, the childcare workers of the Erlong Road Dingzizhe Nursery sent the children to the street factories to let their mothers breastfeed. The sewing group of the Zhangjiazhai Residents Committee Production Cooperative, which was organized in Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward last year, further improved its operating methods and reasonably adjusted its labor organization. Each group increased production from about 30 pieces per day to about 50 pieces, increasing production efficiency by more than half. They accepted an order to process 1,000 pieces of children's clothing, which would have taken until the end of this month to complete according to the past production efficiency, but now can be delivered one week earlier.

After hearing the transmission of the communique and resolutions, the broad masses of rural women became more high-spirited and actively participated in the overproduction competition. Henan Province launched the "Three Increases and One Fullness" activity for autumn crops among rural women throughout the province, ensuring that each cotton plant grows one more boll, each sweet potato plant grows four more ounces, each rice plant produces one more handful, and corn ears are full and grains are plump. At the same time, they vigorously engage in accumulating fertilizer and drying vegetables, and carry out the "100 jin of dried vegetables, 10,000 jin of fertilizer" activity. They also vigorously develop "Five Raisings" (pigs, chickens, ducks, sheep, rabbits), ensuring one pig per household and two chickens per person. In the past few days, 350,000 women in Zhuji, Yuyao, Shangyu, Xiangshan, and other counties in Zhejiang Province have devoted themselves to the fertilizer accumulation movement, strengthened field management, and ensured the success of women's experimental fields. More than 10,000 mu of women's experimental fields in Jinhua Prefecture have now been weeded for the third time. The female members of the Hongqi Production Team of the Hongqi Commune in Xinfan, Sichuan Province, discussed the communique and resolutions and decided to immediately launch a campaign to increase planting and intercropping, ensuring that each adult woman grows 250 to 300 jin of staple grain, and at the same time vigorously engages in accumulating fertilizer, with each woman accumulating 1,000 jin of green manure before National Day. More than 30,000 women in Shuangliao County, Jilin Province, participated in the "Work Hard for Fifty Days and Strive to Exceed Production Quotas by 10-20%" harvest campaign proposed by the county party committee. They have universally applied fertilizer once or twice to the county's 43,400 hectares of third-class seedlings, loosened the soil on 2,550 hectares of autumn ridges, and pulled large weeds on more than 2,850 hectares.

Practicing thrift in household management and saving are important actions for women to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session. In the Ruijin Road First Residents Committee, Chang Le Road Third Residents Committee, and Julu Road Fourth Residents Committee, with more than 2,400 households in Shanghai, housewives plan to save half a degree of electricity and two catties of briquettes per household per month, which can save more than 1,200 degrees of electricity and more than 4,000 catties of briquettes per month. Many neighborhood public canteens mainly run by housewives also try to save materials in various ways. The cooks of the Xingfu First Canteen of the Jiangyin Street Second Residents Committee made their own hot-air stoves, rice washing machines, and vegetable cutting machines, and switched to honeycomb coal stoves, which can save more than 1,000 catties of bituminous coal, more than 600 catties of briquettes, and 70-80 catties of rice per month. They also installed an iron pipe on the hot-air stove to boil water for more than 180 people nearby to drink. At a forum held in the Changshan Residents Committee of Xuhui District, women unanimously expressed their desire to increase savings to respond to the Party's call. The next day, this residents committee opened 312 new savings accounts. In Harbin, the housewives of Jingwei Street in Daoli District, who have been rated as advanced units in social savings in the city and district for three consecutive years, said that they will be more careful and frugal in managing their households, ensuring that each person saves one catty of grain per month, and each household saves three catties of coal, 20 catties of wood, and five degrees of electricity per month to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee.

    广大妇女热情响应八中全会号召
    勤勤恳恳生产　精打细算持家
    据新华社6日讯　中共八届八中全会的公报和决议在全国妇女中引起了热烈反应。她们决心用增产节约、勤俭持家的实际行动，来响应八中全会的伟大号召。
    工业、手工业和服务性行业的女职工们学习了公报和决议后，生产上出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    北京国棉一厂落筒甲班乙组女工，原来对每人每天完成一百四十二公斤落纱任务还信心不足，现在她们提出每人每天保证完成一百四十八公斤。天津国棉一厂女职工保证今年要比国家计划增产棉纱二千八百多件，棉布一百四十四万米，她们并和国棉二厂女职工展开了你追我赶的友谊竞赛。上海国棉二厂女职工提出要确保9月份棉纱、棉布、色布的产量，并全面提高产品质量。这个厂著名的裔式娟小组，提出9月份在计划以外再增产二十八件棉纱。大连造船厂全体女职工展开了热烈的生产竞赛。工具车间十三名女工在半个月中就提出了三十五件革新建议，提高生产效率一到四倍。这个车间女工高桂芝、崔玉兰在生产测计弹簧垫时，想出了多夹的办法，由过去每天生产九十五块提高到五小时就生产七百二十块，质量完全合格。
    北京市西长安街许多街道生产组织，在为响应八中全会号召举行的跃进大会上提出了“大干特干三十天，保证生产翻一番”的计划。护国寺妇女商店的女职工决心争取永远保持红旗商店的光荣称号，提出了“任务越忙、干劲越足、顾客越多、态度越好”的行动口号，这几天，职工们把商店打扫得更加干净，对顾客的态度也更热情了。二龙路邻里服务所的服务员，最近主动下户下工厂为居民送、取拆洗的衣服，并适应季节需要，增加了拆洗棉活的业务，大大便利了居民。二龙路丁字街托儿所保教人员为了使儿童们的妈妈们多休息和多生产，把孩子抱送到街道工厂去让妈妈们喂奶。上海市在去年大跃进中组织起来的张家宅居民委员会生产合作社缝纫组，女社员们进一步改进操作方法，合理调整劳动组织，每个小组由原来每日生产三十件提高到五十件左右，使生产效率提高了一半以上。她们接受委托加工的一千件童装，按过去生产效率要到本月下旬才能完成，现在可以提前一星期交货。
    广大农村妇女听了公报和决议的传达以后，更加斗志昂扬，积极投入了超产竞赛运动。河南省在全省农村妇女中开展秋季作物“三增一满”活动，保证做到每棵棉花多长一个桃，每棵红薯多长四两，每棵水稻多产一撮，玉米满穗，籽粒饱满。同时大搞积肥，大晒干菜，开展“百斤干菜、万斤肥”的活动。并且大力发展“五养”（猪、鸡、鸭、羊、兔），做到一户一头猪，一人两只鸡。浙江省诸暨、余姚、上虞、象山等县这几天有三十五万妇女投入积肥运动，加强田间管理，保证搞好妇女试验田。金华专区一万多亩妇女试验田，目前已普遍耘过了第三遍。四川省新繁红旗公社红旗生产队女社员座谈了公报和决议，决定立即开展增种、间种突击运动，保证每个成年妇女种二百五十斤到三百斤原粮，同时大搞积肥，每个妇女在国庆节前积青肥一千斤。吉林省双辽县有三万多妇女参加了县委提出的“大干五十天，争取农业生产超包产一、二成”的丰收运动。她们已经把全县四万三千四百多公顷三类苗，普遍追了一次到两次肥料，放秋垅二千五百五十公顷，拔大草二千八百五十多公顷。
    勤俭持家、节约储蓄，是妇女们响应八中全会号召的重要行动。在上海市有二千四百多户居民的瑞金路第一居民委员会、长乐路第三居民委员会和钜鹿路第四居民委员会里，家庭主妇们计划每月每户节约半度电、二斤煤球，这样每月就可节约一千二百多度电，四千多斤煤球。主要由家庭妇女主办的许多里弄公共食堂还从各方面设法节约物资。江阴街第二居民委员会幸福第一食堂的炊事人员，自己动手，制造了热气炉、淘米机和切菜机，改用了蜂窝煤炉，每月可以节约烟煤一千多斤，煤球六百多斤，大米七、八十斤。他们还在热气炉上装根铁管用来烧开水，供给附近一百八十多人饮用。在徐汇区长陕居民委员会举行的一次座谈会上，妇女们一致表示要增加储蓄来响应党的号召。第二天这个居委会就新开了三百十二个储蓄户。在哈尔滨市，曾连续三年被评为市、区社会节约先进单位的道里区经纬街的家庭妇女们，表示要更加精打细算、搞好家务，保证每人每月节约一斤粮食，每户每月节约三斤煤、二十斤木柈 、五度电，来响应党中央的号召。
