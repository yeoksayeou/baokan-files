My Decade

    Three Periods, Three Transformations
    Du Huanxiang, Commune Member of Lishui Commune, Nanhai, Guangdong
    I am a member of the Liansha Production Brigade of the Lishui People's Commune in Nanhai County. My family has undergone tremendous changes in the past decade. Looking back now, it's like "a dwarf climbing stairs," rising step by step, with life getting better year by year, especially after joining the People's Commune last year, the improvement has been even faster.
    I don't want to talk about the bitter days before liberation; I only want to talk about the changes in the ten years after liberation. In these ten years, from individual farming to mutual aid teams, agricultural cooperatives, and then to the People's Commune, my family has transformed in three different ways. I deeply feel that mutual aid teams are better than individual farming, agricultural cooperatives are better than mutual aid teams, and the People's Commune is even stronger than agricultural cooperatives.
    During the land reform, my family received twenty-seven mu of land and five thousand two hundred jin of grain, as well as a large number of clothing items as fruits of the struggle. I used the fruits of the struggle to buy back a large water buffalo. Unfortunately, just as my family was planning to make a big push based on the fruits of the land reform, we encountered a natural disaster. In 1953, there was a severe drought. The land I cultivated was two or three li away from the water source, requiring four waterwheels to bring water to the fields. One of the waterwheels had a height difference of five chi, and without three people working together, the waterwheel wouldn't move at all. At that time, I was still an individual farmer, and even with the strength of nine bulls and two tigers, I couldn't do anything in the face of the drought. As a result, we suffered a significant reduction in production that year, with an average yield of only two hundred jin of grain per mu. To make matters worse, my wife gave birth to a child, and my father fell seriously ill. In the face of the natural disaster, we went bankrupt again, and the large water buffalo that we had regained was sold off again.
    The Party truly understands our thoughts. When we demanded further improvement in our lives, it issued the call: "Organize ourselves and develop production." I joined a mutual aid team in the late season of 1953, and in 1955, when the high tide of agricultural cooperation arrived, I joined an agricultural production cooperative. Once we organized, our strength increased greatly! In the mutual aid team, we built a small reservoir; the agricultural cooperative built a medium-sized reservoir with a water storage area of more than one hundred mu. We gradually overcame natural disasters. In the mutual aid team, the average yield per mu was three hundred jin of grain per year. By 1956, with cooperation, it reached five hundred and eighty jin, an increase of nearly one-fold. In 1957, production continued to increase, with an average yield of six hundred and twenty jin per mu. As the water rises, the boat floats higher, and my family's life also improved accordingly. By 1957, the labor points we earned in the agricultural cooperative were enough for a year's worth of food. We had stable meals and no worries about food and clothing, and we no longer needed government relief or loans.
    However, what I did not expect even more was how quickly our lives improved after the establishment of the People's Commune last year. Last year, with the support of the various production teams in the commune, our brigade built a large reservoir with a water storage area of more than four hundred mu, which basically eliminated the threat of floods and droughts. As a result, the average yield per mu for the entire brigade last year was seven hundred and twenty jin, an increase of one hundred jin compared to the previous year. This year's early rice harvest was also a great success. In our team, the average yield per mu was four hundred and twenty jin, an increase of about 20% compared to the three hundred and sixty jin of last year's early rice harvest. There was also a comprehensive bumper harvest of various crops. The commune also established many industries. As the big river rises, the small river fills up, and my life has improved another step. This year's early harvest, although our family's labor force has been greatly reduced, with my parents being old and weak and unable to work, and only two main laborers in the family, the distribution resulted in us receiving two thousand one hundred jin of grain in addition to seventy-eight yuan in wages and fourteen yuan in labor bonuses. The income from one season is equal to the income for the whole year last year. Including household sideline production, we not only have sufficient food, but also some savings. In the past, we couldn't even eat two meals of fish and meat a month. Now, we can eat twelve or thirteen meals a month. In August, the commune planned to supply each person with two jin of fish, chicken, duck, and meat. My family of twelve (I have added three children since liberation) ate a total of twenty-four jin of meat. In the past, the whole family wouldn't make a set of clothes for several years. This year, each of the twelve members of my family made a new set of cloth clothes, some made of interlock fabric and some made of twill fabric. In addition, I, my father, my wife, and my three children, a total of six people, each bought a T-shirt. What made me even happier was that the commune established nurseries, kindergartens, and public canteens, which took care of my four youngest children, and the four older children were able to go to school and study. In the past, only two of these four older children could go to school each year, while the other two stayed at home to take turns caring for their younger siblings. This year, they can all go to school. My wife can also work more confidently in the commune.
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I look back on the past and look forward to the future. With the leadership of the Party and the existence of the People's Commune, I am full of hope and confidence. I feel that our future is bright.

专栏：我这十年来

    三个时期三个样
    广东南海里水公社社员　杜焕祥
    我是南海县里水人民公社联沙生产大队的社员。十年来，我这一家变化真大。现在回头来看，就像“矮子上楼梯”，一步一步高升，生活一年比一年好，特别是去年参加人民公社以后，提高更快。
    解放前的那些苦日子，我不想去讲它了，我只想谈谈解放后十年来的变化情形。十年来，从单干到互助组、农业社，从农业社到人民公社，三个不同的时期，我家可算是变了三个样子。我深深地感到：互助组比单干好，农业社又比互助组好，人民公社更比农业社强。
    在土地改革中，我家分了二十七亩田和五千二百斤谷、一大批衣物的斗争果实。我用斗争果实换回了一只大水牛。不巧，当我们一家正想凭借土地改革的斗争果实，大干一场的时候，却碰上了天灾。在1953年，老天大旱，我耕的田离水源足有两三里路远，要经过四递水车才能引水上田。有一递水，高低相差五尺，没有三个人一齐动脚，水车一点也踏不动。那时，我还是个单干户，纵使有九牛二虎之力，在旱灾面前，也没有一点法子。就这样，那一年落得大减产，平均每亩只收了二百来斤谷子。不料，我的妻子又生下小孩，父亲染了重病。在天灾面前，我们又重新破产了，失而复得的大水牛又卖掉了。
    党，对我们的心思摸得真透，当我们要求进一步改善生活的时候，就发出号召：“组织起来，发展生产”。我在1953年晚造参加了互助组，1955年合作化高潮到来，又参加了农业生产合作社。一组织起来，力量就大啦！在互助组时，我们筑了一个小山塘，农业社又筑了一个蓄水面积一百多亩的中型山塘，自然灾害逐步地被我们战胜了。在互助组时，一年平均亩产三百斤谷，到了1956年合作化，就达到五百八十斤，增产将近一倍，1957年又继续增产，平均亩产达到六百二十斤。水涨船高，我家的生活也跟着提高。到1957年，我们在农业社的劳动工分，已经足够一年口粮了，两餐稳定，温饱不愁，再不用政府救济或贷款了。
    但是，使我更加料想不到的，还是去年成立人民公社后，我们的生活改善得那么快。去年在公社各生产队的支援下，我们大队兴建了一个蓄水面积四百多亩的大山塘，基本上解除了水旱患，因此去年全大队平均亩产七百二十斤，比前年增产了一百斤。今年早造又大增产，以我们的小队来说，平均亩产四百二十斤，比去年早造三百六十斤增产20％左右。各种作物也全面大丰收。公社还办了许多工业。大河水涨，小河水满，我的生活又提高了一步。今年早造，虽然我们全家劳动力已经大大减少，父母双亲，年老力弱，不能出勤了，一家只有两个主要劳动力，但是分配结果，我们除了分足口粮二千一百斤谷以外，还有七十八元工资和十四元劳动奖金，一造的收入就等于去年全年的收入，加上家庭副业，不仅口粮充足，还有余款呢。过去，一个月也吃不上两餐鱼肉，现在一个月内，能够吃到十二、三餐了。以8月份说，社里计划供应每人鱼鸡鸭肉二斤，我一家十二口（解放后我添了三个小孩），一共吃了二十四斤肉。过去全家几年也不做一套衣服，今年一家十二人，每人都做了一套新布衣。有夹布，也有斜布。另外，我和父亲、妻子和三个孩子一共六人，每人还买了一件波恤。更使我高兴的是，公社办了托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂，使我四个最小的孩子得到照顾，四个较大的孩子上学读书了。过去这四个较大的孩子，每年只能两个读书，两个留在家里轮流接替照顾弟妹，今年，他们全部可以上学了。我的妻子也可以更安心在公社劳动了。
    在建国十周年的时候，我回顾过去，看望将来，有了党的领导，有了人民公社，我充满了希望、信心，我觉得我们的前途似锦。
