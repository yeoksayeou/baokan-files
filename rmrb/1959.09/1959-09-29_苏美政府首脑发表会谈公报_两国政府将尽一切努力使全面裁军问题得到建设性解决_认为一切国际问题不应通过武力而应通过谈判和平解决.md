Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 28th, TASS dispatch from Washington, September 27th: The full text of the Khrushchev-Eisenhower talks' joint communiqué is as follows:

    The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, and President D. Eisenhower had a frank exchange of views at Camp David. The Soviet Foreign Minister, A.A. Gromyko, and the United States Secretary of State, C. Herter, as well as other officials from both countries, participated in some of the meetings.

    The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the President agree that these talks were beneficial in clarifying each other's positions on a range of issues. The purpose of these talks was not to hold negotiations. However, it is hoped that the exchange of views will help to better understand each other's motives and positions, thereby contributing to a just and lasting peace.

    The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the President of the United States agree that the problem of complete disarmament is the most important issue facing the world today. Both governments will make every effort to achieve a constructive solution to this problem.

    During the talks, opinions were exchanged on the German question (including the question of a peace treaty with Germany), and both sides' positions were clarified.

    On the Berlin issue, an understanding was reached to resume negotiations in order to reach a solution that would be in the interests of all parties concerned and conducive to maintaining peace. This understanding should be agreed upon by other directly involved parties.

    In addition to these issues, a series of issues involving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were usefully discussed. These issues included trade between the two countries. Considerable progress has been made in official delegation talks on sending more personnel for mutual visits and expanding the exchange of ideas, and corresponding agreements are expected to be reached in the near future.

    The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the President of the United States agree that all unresolved international problems should not be resolved through the use of force, but should be resolved peacefully through negotiations.

    Finally, it was decided that the exact date of the President's return visit to the Soviet Union next spring will be agreed upon through diplomatic channels.
