Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 3rd: The local industry of Korea, which has developed rapidly in recent years, especially since June 1958, is growing into a powerful and vital economic force. At present, there are 2,080 local industrial enterprises and production cooperatives built and developed from scratch and from small to large in various parts of northern Korea, averaging eleven per city and county.

Since the Central Committee of the Workers' Party called for a nationwide movement to develop local industry last June, Korea's local industry has made rapid progress. During this period, the people of various places basically did not use national investment, but explored all aspects of potential and used local raw materials and resources to build more than 1,000 factories. In 1957, the output value of local industry accounted for only 12.8% of the total industrial output value, but increased to 18.2% last year, and is expected to reach 27.5% this year. This year, local industry can produce 2.6 times more products than last year.

The development of local industry has further met the people's needs for consumer goods, building materials, agricultural tools, and other industrial products, and has been warmly supported by the people. The broad masses of people have contributed bricks and wood to build factory buildings, and have taken out hand-woven looms and sewing machines to establish weaving factories and clothing factories. Housewives and citizens enthusiastically entered factories as workers. Employees of state-owned factories also used their spare time to help local factories manufacture machinery and equipment, and imparted technology. In this way, local factories have become increasingly consolidated and developed, equipment has been increasingly expanded, and the level of technology and mechanization has been increasing day by day. Producing consumer goods to meet the needs of local people is the most important task undertaken by local industry. Since last June, among the more than 1,000 newly built local factories, there are 561 factories for weaving, paper making, ceramics, and food. Every county in South Pyongan Province has a weaving factory, and now has a total of 1,200 looms and other textile and knitting equipment. This year, the textiles produced by them using various fibers such as rattan, each person in the province can get an average of five to six meters. In addition, the local industry in South Pyongan Province produces more than 200 kinds of daily necessities.

Local industry also produces a large number of agricultural tools, building materials, and pig iron, etc., to supply the local people's needs for developing production and building houses. Since last year, 121 agricultural tool factories and 235 building materials factories have been newly built. The Sungho County Agricultural Tool Factory, which was developed from a blacksmith's furnace last year, now has five lathes and a smelting furnace. In the first seven months of this year, this factory produced more than 300 ox carts, nearly 100 chaff cutters, and more than 570 hoes. The cement plant and brick and tile factory built by Sunchon County itself can supply farmers throughout the county with enough materials to replace thatched houses with tiled houses in the next few years.

In addition, the small blast furnaces built in Songrim, Gaecheon, Kaesong, Kapsan and other places have also increased production rapidly. At the beginning of this year, Songrim City built a small 4.2-cubic-meter blast furnace in the iron mine. After eight months of production, the workers mastered the technology. Since the third quarter, the daily output has reached more than seven tons.

    群众热情献工献料　技术力量迅速提高
    朝鲜地方工业企业蓬勃发展
    每个市郡平均已有十一个工厂生产大量日用品
    据新华社平壤3日电　在最近几年内特别是从1958年6月以来飞跃发展起来的朝鲜地方工业，正在成长为一支强大的富有生命力的经济力量。现在朝鲜北部各地方从无到有、从小到大建设发展起来的地方工业企业和生产合作社已达二千零八十个，平均每个市、郡（等于县）有十一个。
    自从去年6月劳动党中央号召展开全民性运动发展地方工业以来，朝鲜的地方工业有了突飞猛进的发展。在这一期间，各地人民基本上不用国家投资，发掘各方面的潜力，利用当地的原料和资源建设了一千多个工厂。1957年地方工业产值在工业总产值中，仅占12.8％，去年就增加到18.2％，今年预计可达到27.5％。今年地方工业可生产等于去年二点六倍的产品。
    地方工业的发展，进一步满足了人民对消费品、建筑材料和农具等各种工业品的需要，受到了人民的热烈支持。广大人民纷纷献出砖石和木料建设厂房，拿出手工织布机和缝纫机来成立织布厂和被服厂。家庭妇女们、市民们踊跃地进工厂当工人。国营工厂的职工们也利用业余时间帮助地方工厂制造机械设备，并传授技术。这样，地方工厂就日益巩固发展，设备日益扩大，技术水平和机械化程度日益提高。生产消费品满足当地人民的需要是地方工业担当的最主要的一项任务。去年6月以来，新建的一千多个地方工厂中，织布、造纸、陶瓷和食品等工厂有五百六十一个。平安南道每个郡都有织布厂，现在共有一千二百台织布机和其他纺织、针织设备。今年它们利用山藤等各种纤维生产的纺织品，全道每人平均可分得五米到六米。除此以外，平安南道的地方工业共生产着二百多种日用品。
    地方工业还生产大量的农具、建筑材料和生铁等，供应当地人民发展生产和建设住宅的需要。去年以来，新建的工厂中有一百二十一个农具厂和二百三十五个建筑材料厂。去年由一座铁匠炉发展起来的胜湖郡农具厂，现在已经有五台车床，还有化铁炉。这个厂今年头七个月内，生产了三百多辆牛车，近一百台铡草机和五百七十多把锄头。顺川郡自己建设的水泥厂和砖瓦厂，在近几年内就可以供给全郡的农民把草房换成瓦房。
    另外，松林、价川、开城、甲山等地建设起来的小高炉，生产提高得也很快。松林市今年初在铁矿山里，建成一座四点二立方米的小高炉，经过八个月的生产，工人们掌握了技术，第三季度以来，日产量达到七吨多。
