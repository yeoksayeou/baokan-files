Title: Up and Down, Advance and Retreat, Light and Dark, and the Like

　　It seems that the shock of "the two most astonishing documents from Communist China" was too great, causing some Western gentlemen's brains to become muddled. Listen to them, they are babbling incoherently, confusing up and down, advance and retreat, light and darkness, all jumbled up.
　　It seems that just because the Chinese Communist Party issued resolutions and communiqués, just because we verified production figures and adjusted production targets, suddenly, the Chinese "fell flat on their faces," and the Great Leap Forward became a "Great Leap Backward"; thus we are in the "darkest year." Then, what is the situation of those Western gentlemen? Naturally, they should be rising with their faces up (this is what is called "looking up to the sky"), advancing rapidly, and living in the brightest year. No wonder they are so elated.
　　Originally, we could ignore these absurdities. They can say whatever they want, anyway, history will eventually settle the score. They say we are going "down," well, let it be down; but we have more steel, more coal, more grain, more cotton, and everything else like electricity and machinery, we eat, wear, and use more things, so what's wrong with such a "falling flat on our faces"? Say we are "retreating"? Fine, let it be retreating; but this year's retreat, retreats to 1962, the fifteen years to catch up with Britain is reduced to ten years; the twelve-year agricultural program will also retreat for many years. Such a retreat can probably be said to be unprecedented. Say we are "dark"? However, in this dark realm, there are thriving scenes, there are waves of tumultuous horses galloping, there are people with high spirits and fighting spirit, and there are joyful songs all over the world. The brilliance of "darkness" stings some demons and monsters so much that they can't open their eyes! It makes them shut their eyes and shout: Dark, dark!
　　In short, there is no need to argue with these seemingly exceptionally intelligent people, let them say whatever they want. Anyway, their words can never change our reality, and our reality cannot make them change their tune for the time being. If they want to say so, what can others do?
　　However, just like the saying goes, "enemies often meet on a narrow road." By chance, I flipped through some materials and came across some "upward" and "forward" figures of the Western gentlemen, which are indeed extremely "bright." If we compare them with our "downward," "retreating," and "dark" figures, the "brightness" becomes even more obvious. This is very helpful for us to understand these things like up and down, advance and retreat, light and darkness. So, it's worth making a simple comparison:
　　In 1958, compared with 1957, our total industrial output value increased by 66%; the United States decreased by 6.3%; and the United Kingdom decreased by 0.9%.
　　Among them, steel, China increased by 49.5% (only counting foreign steel); the United States decreased by 24.5%; and the United Kingdom decreased by 9.8%.
　　Coal: China increased by 108%; the United States decreased by 17.6%; and the United Kingdom decreased by 3.5%.
　　Grain and cotton can be compared between 1958 and 1949. The total grain output increased by 1.31 times, and the total cotton output increased by 3.7 times; the cotton output of the United States decreased by 28.1%; and the grain output of the United Kingdom decreased by 12.7%.
　　After such a comparison, I can't help but compose a few lines of song:
　　　　Up or not, steel, coal, grain, and cotton are falling,
　　　　Advance or not, a decade retreats by one or two tenths,
　　　　Bright or not, eyes are black and hearts ache.
　　　　Down or not, steel increases by a thousand tons, and grain increases by half,
　　　　Retreat or not, fifty-nine advances to sixty-two,
　　　　Dark or not, even the brilliance of the sun and moon is considered dim.

    上下、进退、明暗之类
    董逢亚
    不知是不是由于“来自共产党中国的两个最惊人的文件”的震动力量太大了，因而把一些西方老爷们的头脑震得发起昏来。你听，他们正在颠三倒四的混喊，什么上或下呀，进或退呀，光明或暗淡呀，全被他们弄得颠倒了。
    好像只是由于中国共产党发表了决议和公报，只是由于我们核实了生产数字和调整了生产指标，所以忽然间，中国人便“脸朝下倒了下去”，大跃进便成了“大跃退”；于是我们也便处在“最暗淡的年份”里了。那末，那些西方老爷的处境又怎样呢？自然应该是脸朝上升上去（此所谓“仰面朝天”也）、在飞速前进，处在最光明的年份里了。怪不得他们那样飘飘然。
    本来，对于这些胡言乱语，也可以不理的。他们愿说什么就说什么好了，反正总有一天历史会来结账的。说我们是向“下”，就算是向下吧；但我们却是钢多了，煤多了，粮多了，棉多了，其他如电力、机械等等一切东西都多了，吃、穿、用得都多了，这样的“脸朝下倒下去”又有什么不好呢？说我们是“跃退”吗？就算是跃退吧；可是今年一退，就退到了1962年，十五年赶英国的事退的只剩了十年；十二年农业纲要，也要退回好多年来了。这样的退大概也可以说是史无前例的吧。说我们“暗淡”吗？可是，在这暗淡的境界里，有的是蒸蒸日上欣欣向荣的景象，有的是波浪滔天万马奔腾的局面，有的是意气风发斗志昂扬的人民，有的是四海欢腾洋溢城野的歌声。“暗淡”的光华，竟刺得一些牛鬼蛇神睁不开眼！急得他们闭着眼睛大喊：暗淡呀暗淡。
    总之，同这些仿佛异常聪敏的人无需分辩，他们说什么就算什么好了。反正，他们的话永远也不能改变我们的现实，而我们的现实也暂时无法使他们改嘴。他们要这样说，别人能有什么办法呢？
    然而，正好像俗话说的“冤家路儿窄”。随手翻些材料，偏偏就翻到了西方老爷们的一些“向上”“前进”的数字，那的确是极“光明”的。如果用我们“向下”的“跃退”的“暗淡”数字一对比，那“光明”便愈发显眼。这是很有助于我们弄清上下进退明暗这些玩艺的。所以不妨作个简单的对比：
    1958年工业总产值，同1957年相比，我们增长了66％；美国下降6.3％；英国下降0.9％。
    其中，钢，中国增长了49.5％（只算洋钢）；美国下降24.5％；英国下降9.8％。
    煤：中国增长108％；美国下降17.6％；英国下降3.5％。
    粮棉可以拿1958年同1949年相比，粮食总产量，我们增长了一点三一倍，棉花总产量增长三点七倍；美国的棉花下降了28.1％；英国的粮食下降12.7％。
    这样一比，便不禁编出几句歌来：
        上不上，钢煤粮棉往下降，
        进不进，十年倒退一二成，
        明不明，两眼发黑心发疼。
        下不下，钢上千吨粮加半，
        退不退，五九进到六十二，
        暗不暗，日月光华还嫌淡。
