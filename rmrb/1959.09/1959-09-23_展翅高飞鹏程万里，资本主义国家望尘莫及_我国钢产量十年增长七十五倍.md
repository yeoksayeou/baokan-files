Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Achieving high-speed development, initially forming a steel industry system, and rapidly improving technological levels. These are the glorious achievements of China's steel industry over the past ten years.

This year, China's steel production will reach 12 million tons, a seventy-five-fold increase compared to 1949. Pig iron production will also see significant growth. In 1958, China's steel production already reached 8 million tons (excluding 3.08 million tons of indigenous steel), leaping from 25th in the world in 1949 to 7th place. China's pig iron production reached 13.69 million tons, surpassing the United Kingdom, jumping from 23rd in the world in 1949 to 4th place.

During the First Five-Year Plan, China's steel production grew at an average annual rate of 31.7%, a speed unmatched by any capitalist country. In 1958, "modern" steel production increased by 49.5% compared to 1957, and this year it will increase by 50% compared to 1958.

The leap-forward development of China's steel industry over the past ten years once again powerfully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. It took major capitalist countries a long time to increase steel production from over 150,000 tons to around 12 million tons: Britain took 67 years, the United States took 29 years, France took 82 years, pre-war Germany took 50 years, and Japan took 47 years. In old China, from 1890 to the eve of liberation, the total steel production in the 59 years of modern steel industry was only 7.6 million tons, less than two-thirds of this year's annual steel production.

Large-scale steel industry construction is an important reason for guaranteeing the leap-forward development of China's steel production. For the past ten years, the Party and the government have been very concerned about the recovery and development of the steel industry. According to statistics, from 1950 to 1958, the state's investment in steel industry construction accounted for 15.8% of the total investment in national industrial capital construction. More than 400 large, medium, and small steel enterprise construction projects have been completed and put into production. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, inspired by the Party's general line of building socialism, the policy of simultaneously promoting central and local industries, large and small enterprises, and "modern" and "indigenous" production methods has been implemented, launching a mass movement of the whole Party and the entire people to develop steel. Steel industry production and construction have both experienced an unprecedented surge. As of August this year, more than 60,000 cubic meters of blast furnace volume nationwide has been built since the Great Leap Forward last year, and 1,400 tons of converter capacity nationwide has been built since the Great Leap Forward last year. Anshan Iron and Steel, China's largest steel base, has developed into one of the world's ten super-large steel enterprises with an annual steel output of more than 3 million tons. Capitalist countries such as Britain, West Germany, France, and Japan do not yet have such large steel enterprises today.

Through large-scale construction, China's steel industry has initially formed its own system. This is mainly reflected in three aspects:

First, the proportion of steel industry output value in the total industrial output value has greatly increased.

Second, the layout of the steel industry has become more rational. The eight large steel enterprises, more than twenty medium-sized steel enterprises, and numerous small steel plants and iron-smelting plants that have been built and are under construction are distributed in the vast majority of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, fundamentally changing the unreasonable layout of steel enterprises concentrated in coastal areas before liberation.

Third, the incomplete state of the old Chinese steel industry production system has been changed. Before liberation, in 1943, the year with the highest steel production in China, if iron production was taken as 100, steel production was only 51.2% of iron production, and steel材 production was only 38.1%, a large disparity. By 1957, steel production was equivalent to 90% of the iron production in the same year, and steel材 production was equivalent to 74%. This year, China can produce more than 500 kinds of alloy steel, high-quality steel, and more than 6,000 kinds of steel材. About 90% of the steel材 needed nationwide can be self-sufficient.

The technical level of China's steel industry production and construction has also seen amazing development in the past ten years. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, China has built a batch of large-scale steel enterprises with world-leading equipment. A large number of Soviet experts have taught advanced experience to China's steel enterprises, which has played an important role in improving the utilization coefficient of China's steel equipment, improving production operations, and accelerating the construction of steel enterprises. In 1949, according to statistics from key enterprises, the blast furnace utilization coefficient was only 0.62, and it increased to 1.49 in 1958. The current monthly average utilization coefficient of advanced blast furnaces at Benxi Iron and Steel Company has reached more than 2.4. In 1949, the open hearth furnace utilization coefficient was only 2.42, and it increased to 7.78 in 1958. The current monthly average utilization coefficient of advanced small open hearth furnaces at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant has reached more than 14. In 1952, the electric furnace utilization coefficient was only 7.4, and it increased to 22.64 in 1958. The current monthly average utilization coefficient of the advanced Dalian Steel Plant has reached more than 37. These utilization coefficients are all at the forefront of the world's industry. Technologies in steel rolling, mining, coking, and refractory material production have also been greatly improved. In terms of capital construction, during the First Five-Year Plan, it took at least eight months to build a large blast furnace with a volume of less than 1,000 cubic meters. However, the large blast furnace with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters built by Anshan Iron and Steel last year and the large blast furnace with a volume of 1,436 cubic meters built by Wuhan Iron and Steel this year only took more than four months from groundbreaking to iron tapping. The time required to build a large open hearth furnace has also been shortened from more than six months to four months, and the quality of the projects has been guaranteed. During the First Five-Year Plan, China's designers could not independently design steel enterprises. Now, China can design large steel complexes with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel quickly, well, and economically. In 1958 and 1959, the average investment in capital construction for each ton of steel produced by large steel enterprises in China was 500 to 700 yuan, and 300 to 500 yuan for small and medium-sized enterprises, saving 30% to 40% of investment compared to the First Five-Year Plan.

    展翅高飞鹏程万里，资本主义国家望尘莫及
    我国钢产量十年增长七十五倍
    钢铁工业体系初步形成，四百多项工程已经建成投入生产
    钢产量从十五万多吨飞升到一千二百万吨，已能生产五百多种合金钢、优质钢和六千多种钢材
    新华社22日讯　实现了高速度发展，初步形成了钢铁工业体系，迅速提高了技术水平。这是我国钢铁工业十年来的光辉成就。
    今年，我国钢产量将达到一千二百万吨，比1949年增长七十五倍；生铁产量也将有巨大的增长。在1958年，我国钢产量已经达到了八百万吨（未包括三百零八万吨土钢在内），由1949年居世界钢产量的第二十五位跃进为第七位；我国生铁产量达到了一千三百六十九万吨，已经超过英国，由1949年世界铁产量的第二十三位跃居为第四位。
    第一个五年计划期间，我国钢产量每年平均增长速度是31.7％，这个速度为所有的资本主义国家望尘莫及。而1958年，“洋”钢产量又比1957年增长了49.5％；今年又将比1958年增长50％。
    我国钢铁工业十年来的飞跃发展，再一次有力地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。那些主要资本主义国家，把钢产量从十五万多吨提高到一千二百万吨左右，英国用了六十七年，美国用了二十九年，法国用了八十二年，战前德国用了五十年，日本用了四十七年。旧中国开办现代钢铁工业，从1890年到解放前夕五十九年间，总共只生产了七百六十万吨钢，还不到今年一年钢产量的三分之二。
    大规模的钢铁工业建设，是保证我国钢铁生产飞跃发展的重要原因。十年来，党和政府一直十分关怀钢铁工业的恢复和发展。据统计，从1950年到1958年，国家用于钢铁工业建设的投资，占全国工业基本建设投资总额的15.8％，已经建成并投入生产的大、中、小型钢铁企业建设工程有四百多项。特别是1958年大跃进以来，在党的建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，贯彻执行了中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业、“洋”法生产和“土”法生产同时并举的方针，掀起了全党全民大办钢铁的群众运动，钢铁工业生产和建设，都出现了空前高涨的大跃进的局面。到今年8月为止，全国高炉容积中有六万多立方米是从去年大跃进以来建设起来的；全国转炉容量中有一千四百吨是从去年大跃进以来建设起来的。我国最大的钢铁基地鞍钢，已经发展成为全世界十个年产钢三百万吨以上的特大钢铁企业之一，英国、西德、法国、日本等资本主义国家，到今天还没有这样大的钢铁企业。
    经过大规模的建设，我国钢铁工业初步形成了自己的体系。这主要表现在三个方面：
    第一，钢铁工业产值在整个工业总产值中所占的比重，已经大大增加了。
    第二，钢铁工业的布局已经趋于合理。已经建成和正在建设的八个大型钢铁企业、二十多个中型钢铁企业和许许多多小型钢铁厂、炼铁厂，分布在全国绝大多数省、市、自治区，从根本上改变了解放前钢铁企业偏集沿海地带的不合理的布局。
    第三，改变了旧中国钢铁工业生产系统残缺不全的状况。解放前我国钢铁产量最高的1943年，如以铁产量为一百，则钢产量仅为铁产量的51.2％，钢材产量仅为38.1％，悬殊很大。到了1957年，钢产量相当于同年铁产量的90％，钢材产量相当于74％。今年，我国已能生产五百多种合金钢、优质钢和六千多种钢材，全国所需钢材，90％左右可自给。
    我国钢铁工业生产、建设的技术水平，十年来也有了惊人的发展。在苏联和各兄弟国家无私的援助下，我国建设了一批具有世界上先进设备的大型钢铁企业。大批苏联专家向我国钢铁企业传授了先进经验，这对提高我国钢铁设备利用系数、改善生产操作、加速钢铁企业建设，都起了重要作用。1949年按照重点企业统计，高炉利用系数仅为零点六二，1958年提高到一点四九；本溪钢铁公司先进高炉月平均利用系数目前达到二点四以上。1949年平炉利用系数仅为二点四二，1958年提高到七点七八；上海第三钢厂先进小平炉的月平均利用系数目前达到十四以上。1952年电炉利用系数仅为七点四，1958年提高到二十二点六四；先进的大连钢厂月平均利用系数目前达到三十七以上。这些利用系数都居于世界同业的前列。轧钢、采矿、炼焦、耐火材料生产等方面的技术，也有了很大提高。在基本建设方面，第一个五年计划期间，建设一座容积不到一千立方米的大高炉，最快需要八个月；而去年鞍钢建成的容积为一千五百一十三立方米的大高炉和今年武钢建成的一千四百三十六立方米的大高炉，从破土到出铁都只用了四个多月。建设一座大平炉所需的时间，也由六个多月缩短到四个月，而且都保证了工程质量。第一个五年计划期间，我国设计人员还不能独立设计钢铁企业，现在我国已经可以又多、又快、又好、又省地设计年产一百五十万吨钢的大型钢铁联合企业了。1958年和1959年，我国大型钢铁企业平均每生产一吨钢，需要基本建设投资五百到七百元，中小型企业需要三百到五百元，比第一个五年计划期间节省投资30％到40％。（附图片）
