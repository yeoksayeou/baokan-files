Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th dispatch: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket is expected to reach the moon at 5:05 AM (Beijing time) on the morning of the 14th. Currently, the rocket is continuing to advance towards the moon along its predetermined trajectory.

Upon reaching the moon, the rocket may become a satellite of the moon or continue onward to become a new artificial planet. A final conclusion cannot be made at this time. However, in either case, the rocket will provide new and valuable materials for science.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th dispatch: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket re-entered the observation area of Soviet measuring stations and observation points at 9:00 AM Moscow time on September 13th and will remain within the observation area for the remainder of its journey to the moon. By 10:00 AM Moscow time on September 13th, the rocket had traveled 258,000 kilometers from Earth. Its coordinates were: declination minus 11.3 degrees; right ascension 20 hours 49 minutes. The rocket was approximately 112,000 kilometers from the moon.

Ground observation stations obtained scientific information from the rocket regarding the Earth's radiation belts, the Earth's magnetic field, cosmic rays, meteor particles, and interstellar gas. The actual trajectory of the rocket's flight to the moon is being determined based on radio observations of the distance and angle used to determine the rocket's position, as well as measurements of the radial velocity. Measurements and calculations indicate that the rocket's trajectory towards the moon is very close to the predetermined trajectory.

By 2:00 PM Moscow time on September 13th, the Soviet cosmic rocket will have traveled 290,000 kilometers from the Earth, approximately 80,000 kilometers from the moon. The rocket's coordinates will be: declination minus 12 degrees; right ascension 20 hours 49 minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th dispatch: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket is continuing to fly towards the moon. Scientific measurement information is continuously being received from the rocket on the ground. At 3:20 AM Moscow time on September 13th (8:20 AM Beijing time), the rocket flew out of the observation area of the Soviet observation stations. At this time, it was 200,000 kilometers from Earth, more than half the distance from Earth to the moon.

Observatories in Alma-Ata, Bulagan, Abastumani, Tbilisi, Stalinabad, Simferopol, and many other cities in the Soviet Union have observed the artificial comet created by the cosmic rocket. Observatories in Bulagan, Stalinabad, Alma-Ata, and Simferopol have all taken photographs of the artificial comet, which are currently being processed. The shooting conditions were not ideal, and the sky was frequently obscured by clouds while the comet's formation was being photographed.

The comet appeared in the predetermined location in the constellation Aquarius, and its coordinates were also close to the predetermined coordinates. The artificial comet began to be observed at 9:48 PM Moscow time on the 12th. At that time, the amplitude of the luminous sodium cloud was very large. The observed time was five or six minutes, and the maximum brightness was equal to that of a fourth or fifth magnitude star.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th dispatch: The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket is continuing to fly towards the moon. At 10:00 PM Moscow time on the 12th (3:00 AM Beijing time on the 13th), the rocket was positioned over South Africa (Tanganyika), 152,000 kilometers from the ground. All ground observation stations are continuing to observe the rocket's flight and record the scientific information sent by the rocket. According to preliminary data compiled from telemetry information, all scientific instruments installed in the rocket container are functioning normally. The temperature of the gas inside the container is maintained between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, the container's airtightness is maintained at the original level, and scientific measurement information continues to be sent from various measurement points to the calculation center for processing.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Soviet scientists have been giving talks or writing articles, discussing the great achievements of launching the second cosmic rocket.

Academician Barabashov of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Chairman of the Lunar and Planetary Physical Conditions Research Committee of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told TASS reporters that the Soviet Union's launch of the second cosmic rocket to the moon has opened up new prospects in the conquest of space and provided the possibility of landing on the moon and the nearest planets in the solar system.

He said that this event will provide new information for the development of astronautics and will help to launch not only automatic spacecraft to the moon and planets in the not-too-distant future, but also to enable the first Soviet cosmonauts to set foot on the surface of the moon and planets.

Martynov, a famous Soviet scientist and director of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow, said that it will be difficult for scientists to observe the scene when the second cosmic rocket reaches the moon, because the sign that the rocket reaches the moon will be the sudden interruption of the radio signal sent by the rocket. Martynov made these remarks to a reporter from "Komsomolskaya Pravda." He also said that the rocket's stay in the astronomers' field of vision will not be long. When the second rocket arrives at the moon at 0:05 AM (Moscow time) on the 14th, its speed will be three kilometers per second, so it will collide with the surface of the moon and be destroyed. The moment the rocket's outer shell hits the surface of the moon will be absolutely invisible to the naked eye, and astronomers will not be able to see the dust cloud caused by the impact.

Martynov pointed out that if the cosmic rocket reaches the moon and remains intact on the moon without being damaged (which is actually impossible), people on Earth will not be able to see the rocket's body, because the distance between the Earth and the moon is very far, and the observable range is very small. Only a cosmic rocket with a diameter of 200 to 300 meters staying on the moon can be seen by people. (Attached picture)

    苏联宇宙火箭顺利奔向月球
    可能成为月球卫星或继续前进成为新的人造行星
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联第二个宇宙火箭预计在14日清早五时零五分（北京时间）到达月球。目前，火箭正在按预定的轨道继续向月球前进。
    这个火箭在到达月球时，有可能成为月球的卫星或继续前进成为新的人造行星。目前，还不能作出最后结论。但是，无论是那种情况，火箭都将给科学提供出新的珍贵的材料。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联第二个宇宙火箭在9月13日莫斯科时间九时，已经重新进入苏联测量站和观测点的观测区，并在所剩下的到达月球的全部行程中都将处在观测区里。到9月13日莫斯科时间十时，火箭离开地球已达二十五万八千公里。它的座标是：赤纬负十一点三度；赤经二十时四十九分。火箭距月球还有约十一万二千公里。
    地面的观测站从火箭上获得了有关地球辐射带、地球磁场、宇宙线、流星粒子和星际气体等方面的科学情报。根据对确定火箭位置的现有的距离和角度的无线电观测，以及根据对经向速度的测量，正在确定火箭向月球飞行的实际轨道。测量和计算表明，火箭飞向月球的轨道同预定的轨道十分接近。
    到9月13日莫斯科时间十四时，苏联宇宙火箭离开地面的距离将达二十九万公里，距月球约八万公里。火箭的座标将为：赤纬负十二度；赤经二十时四十九分。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联第二个宇宙火箭正在继续向月球飞行。地面上不断收到从火箭上发出的科学测量的情报。在莫斯科时间9月13日三时二十分（北京时间八时二十分）时，火箭飞出了苏联各观测站的观测区，这时，它距地球二十万公里，等于地球到月球路程的一半以上。
    阿拉木图、布拉干、阿巴斯图马尼、第比利斯、斯大林纳巴德、森佛罗波尔以及苏联其它许多城市的天文台都观测到了宇宙火箭所造成的人造慧星。布拉干、斯大林纳巴德、阿拉木图、森佛罗波尔等地天文台都拍摄了人造彗星的照片正在进行整理中。拍摄的条件不太好，在拍摄彗星形成现象时，天空屡屡被云遮住。
    彗星出现在预定地点宝瓶星座中，它的座标也接近预定的座标。人造彗星是在莫斯科时间12日二十一时四十八分开始被观测到的。那时，发光的钠云的幅度很大。观测到的时间是五、六分钟，当时最大的亮度等于四、五等星。
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：苏联第二个宇宙火箭正在继续向月球飞行，到莫斯科时间12日二十二时（北京时间13日三时）火箭位置在南非（坦噶尼喀）上空，距地面十五万二千公里。地面上的所有观测站在继续观察火箭飞行情况，并记录由火箭发来的科学情报。根据遥测情报整理出的初步数据，装置在火箭容器内的所有科学仪器都正常地工作着。容器内气体的温度保持在摄氏二十度到二十五度之间，容器的密闭度保持在原定的水平，科学测量情报继续从各测量点发到计算中心进行整理。
    据新华社13日讯　苏联科学家纷纷发表谈话或撰写文章，论述发射第二个宇宙火箭的重大成就。
    乌克兰科学院院士、苏联科学院天文学委员会月球和行星物理条件研究委员会主席巴拉巴绍夫向塔斯社记者说，苏联向月球发射的第二个宇宙火箭在征服宇宙方面开辟了新的前景，并为在月球和太阳系最近的行星着陆提供了可能性。
    他说，这个事件将为宇宙航行学的发展提供新的情报，并有助于在不很长远的时间内向月球和行星不仅发射自动装置的星际飞船，而且使第一批苏联宇宙航行家有可能踏上月球和行星的表面。
    苏联著名科学家、莫斯科什捷恩别格天文研究所所长马尔蒂诺夫说，科学家们将很难观测到第二个宇宙火箭到达月球时的情景，因为火箭到达月球的标志将是火箭所发的无线电讯号的突然中断。马尔蒂诺夫是对“共青团真理报”记者发表这番谈话的。他还说，火箭在天文学家们的视野里逗留的时间是不长的。第二个火箭在14日零时五分（莫斯科时间）抵达月球时的速度将是每秒三公里，因此，它将碰撞在月球表面上而毁灭。火箭外壳碰到月球表面的一刹那，用肉眼是绝对看不到的，天文学家们也将看不到碰击时所造成的尘云。
    马尔蒂诺夫指出，如果宇宙火箭到达月球时，不被碰坏而完整地保留在月球上（事实上这是不可能的），地球上的人们也不可能看到火箭的躯体，因为地球和月球的距离很远，而可观测的范围又很小，只有直径二百至三百米的宇宙火箭停留在月球上才能够被人们看到。（附图片）
