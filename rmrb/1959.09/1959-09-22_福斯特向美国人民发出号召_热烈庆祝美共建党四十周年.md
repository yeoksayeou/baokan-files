Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st. According to the American "Worker's Weekly" published on September 20th, the honorary chairman of the American Communist Party, Foster, called on the American people from his sickbed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the American Communist Party on a large scale.
    Foster emphasized in a statement sent to Flynn and Davis, who were preparing for the celebration:
    "We are currently living in a period of rapid transition in the world from capitalism to socialism, and the task of the American Communist Party is of utmost importance in this enormous transformation, especially as we celebrate its birthday."
    The statement said: "In the current intense global competition between socialism and capitalism, communism is undoubtedly the stronger of the two forces. This is becoming increasingly clear as we directly compare the relative strengths of the two systems in terms of industrial and agricultural output, scientific achievements, educational systems, and many other aspects of social organization."
      "The era in which capitalism wanted to extinguish the communist movement and the people's movement through war has also definitely passed. Today, the most important issue is maintaining world peace."
    In his statement, Foster pointed out that the American labor movement and the American Communist Party are experiencing serious difficulties. He said: "The steel strike has lasted for nearly three months, the vicious attack on the labor movement embodied in the 'labor reform' bill, the war makers continue to try to build a militaristic war machine, desperately trying to prevent blacks from voting and prevent black and white integration in schools and restoring lynching, and various other attacks on workers, all of which illustrate the seriousness of the situation."
    However, Foster believes that the large-scale demonstration held by American workers in New York on American Labor Day on September 7 was "great". He pointed out that the increasingly fierce offensive launched by large American corporations can and must be defeated by a united American labor movement with high morale.
    "Worker's Weekly" also published an editorial on September 20 entitled "Forty Years" to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the American Communist Party. The editorial said: "Forty years have passed since the founding of the American Communist Party in September 1919. In these forty years, people have seen the beginning of the end of a cruel and terrible period in human history and the birth of a happier period for all mankind, namely the era of socialism and peace. American communists, like communists in all countries, can be proud of the role they have played in creating this history."
    The editorial said: The American Communist Party "is united with the builders of the future of the twentieth century, with the socialist builders of the Soviet Union, China and the people's democratic countries, and with the victors of the national independence movements in Africa, Latin America and Asia."
    The editorial emphasized: "It is precisely because the American Communist Party is rooted in the American people and the working class that it has helped the people achieve victories that were unimaginable forty years ago."

    福斯特向美国人民发出号召
    热烈庆祝美共建党四十周年
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：据9月20日出版的美国“工人周报”报道，美国共产党名誉主席福斯特从他的病榻上号召美国人民大规模地庆祝美国共产党成立四十周年。
    福斯特在送给筹备庆祝事宜的弗林和戴维斯两人的一项声明中强调指出：
  “我们目前生活在世界由资本主义迅速转变到社会主义的时期中，美国共产党的任务在这个巨大的转变中具有极大的重要性，特别是在我们庆祝它的生日的时候。”
    声明说：“在目前社会主义和资本主义之间进行着的紧张的世界竞争中，共产主义无疑地是两支力量中比较强大的一支。当我们把这两种制度在工农业产量、科学成就、教育制度以及社会组织的许多其他方面的对比力量加以直接比较的时候，这一点就越来越明显。”
      “资本主义想要通过战争来扑灭共产主义运动和人民运动的时代，也已经肯定地过去了。今天最重要的问题是维护世界和平。”
    福斯特在声明中指出，美国劳工运动以及美国共产党正经历着严重的困难。他说：“钢铁罢工持续了已将近三个月、‘劳工改革’法案所体现的对劳工运动的恶毒进攻、战争制造者继续在设法建立黩武主义的战争机器、拚命想要不让黑人有投票权和阻止黑白人合校并恢复私刑，以及其他各种对工人的进攻，凡此种种都说明了局势的严重性。”
    但是，福斯特认为美国工人在9月7日美国劳动节在纽约举行的大规模示威是“伟大的”。他指出：美国大企业发动的越来越猛烈的攻势能够而且一定会被斗志昂扬的统一的美国劳工运动所击败。
    “工人周报”在9月20日也发表一篇题为“四十年”的社论，庆祝美共建党四十周年，社论说：“自从美国共产党在1919年9月建党到现在已经有四十年了，在这四十年中，人们看到了人类史上一个残酷的、可怕的时期开始结束，全人类较幸福的时期、即社会主义和和平的时期的诞生。美国共产党人像世界各国共产党人一样，可以对他们在缔造这一历史的过程中所起的作用感到自豪。”
    社论说：美国共产党“同二十世纪的未来的建设者，同苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的社会主义建设者，同非洲、拉丁美洲和亚洲的民族独立运动的胜利者团结一致。”
    社论强调指出：“美国共产党正是由于生根在美国人民和工人阶级当中，所以帮助人民取得了四十年前所没有想到的胜利。”
