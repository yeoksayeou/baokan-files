Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 11th. A great success of spring wheat harvest came from Delingha Farm in the eastern Qaidam Basin. This farm planted a total of 13,000 mu of spring wheat this year, and most of it has been harvested. Among them, 1,578.25 mu of threshed spring wheat yielded an average of 1,057 jin per mu.

This year, Delingha Farm implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in a manner suited to local conditions from sowing to harvest. Before sowing, the general land was deeply ploughed to a depth of about one chi, and more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and close planting was implemented. In view of the characteristics of the high-altitude and cold region, the fertilizer was processed and rotted to improve fertilizer efficiency. Attention was paid to the combined use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilizer application, and continuous topdressing was adopted. Fertilizer was accumulated, rotted, and topdressed continuously, and topdressing was never stopped from jointing to maturity. In terms of sowing time, it was found that early sowing could increase the differentiation period of small ears and small flowers, so conditions for early sowing were actively created, and this year's sowing was done nine to ten days earlier.

    柴达木盆地传来丰收喜报
    一千五百亩春小麦亩产过千斤
    新华社西宁11日电　柴达木盆地东部德令哈农场传出了春小麦大面积丰收捷报。这个农场今年共种春小麦一万三千亩，大部分已收割，其中已脱粒的一千五百七十八亩四分春小麦，平均亩产一千零五十七斤。
    今年，德令哈农场的春小麦从种到收，都因地制宜地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。在下种前，一般土地都深翻一尺左右，亩施肥料两万多斤，并且实行了密植。根据地处高寒的特点，为了提高肥效，肥料都经过加工腐熟。在肥料施用上注意做到氮、磷、钾的配合使用，并采取不断追肥的办法，做到随积攒、随腐熟、随追肥，从拔节到成熟追肥一直未停。在播种时间上，摸索到提前播种可以增长小穗小花的分化时期，因而积极创造早播条件，今年早播了九天到十天。
