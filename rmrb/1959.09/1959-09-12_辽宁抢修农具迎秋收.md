Liaoning Rushes to Repair Farm Tools to Welcome Autumn Harvest

    (Our dispatch from Shenyang, 11th) The broad masses of rural areas in Liaoning Province have already listed the work of welcoming and organizing the autumn harvest as the most prominent central task at present.

    Currently, various localities are repairing and manufacturing carts and rushing to produce various small farm tools. Tie嶺 County has already launched a new high tide of everyone pitching in and every household preparing autumn harvest tools. The entire county has repaired more than 11,000 carts, and another 400 are under construction. Farm tools and autumn harvest supplies such as scythes, brooms, and cart rope sets have been basically prepared. In Xin金 County, where the autumn harvest season is earlier, all the iron and wood craftsmen in the towns have gone to the countryside to repair and manufacture tools by dividing up areas. The repair and assembly plant of the Huzhuang People's Commune in Yingkou County has been working non-stop recently, forging scythes, cart iron tiles, and other tools. The comprehensive factory of the Yizhou Town People's Commune in Yi County recently successfully trial-produced a "fast harvester" and a "four-blade harvester from old plows," which are being vigorously promoted throughout the county.

    Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a rural work telephone conference, requiring all localities to make full preparations on the eve of the autumn harvest battle, overcome the right-leaning laxity of "there must be some loss in a bumper harvest," and ensure that every grain is brought into the granary. The specific requirements of the Provincial Committee for this year's autumn harvest work are: one early (start early, advocate timely and early harvesting), two good (harvest the major autumn crops mainly of grain, cotton, and oil, and also harvest mountain products, wild fruits, forest, livestock, and aquatic products well), three fast (fast harvesting, fast threshing, fast pulling, advocate building courtyards on the spot, pulling and threshing as you harvest, and entering the granary as you thresh), four clean (the ground is clean, the courtyards are clean, the roads are clean, and the stalks are threshed clean), and five combinations (while doing a good job in the autumn harvest, combine it with autumn harvest distribution, autumn plowing and planting, autumn vegetable management, autumn seed selection, and autumn procurement), and strive to achieve a double harvest of agriculture and diversified operations.

    辽宁抢修农具迎秋收
    本报沈阳11日电　辽宁省广大农村已把迎接和组织秋收的工作列为当前最突出的中心任务。
    目前，各地正在修造大车和赶制各种小型农具。铁岭县已经掀起了人人动手、户户准备秋收工具的新高潮。全县已修好一万一千多台大车，还有四百台正在制造中。镰刀、笤帚、大车绳套等农具和秋收用品，已基本备足。秋收季节较早的新金县，在修理农具的工作中，各城镇的铁木匠都已下乡，分片包修包造。营口县虎庄人民公社的修配厂，近日来正在炉不停火、锤不住声地赶制镰刀、大车铁瓦等工具。义县义州镇人民公社综合工厂，最近已试制成功了“快速收割器”和“旧犁四刀收割器”，正在全县大力推广。
    最近，中共辽宁省委召开农村工作电话会议，要求各地在秋收战役前夕做好充分准备，克服“丰收必有一丢”的右倾松劲情绪，保证颗粒归仓。省委对今年秋收工作的具体要求是：一早（动手早，提倡适时早割）、二好（收好以粮食、棉花、油料为主的大秋作物，同时也收好山货、野果、林、牧、水产品）、三快（快收、快打、快拉，提倡就地建场院，随收随拉，随拉随打，随打随入仓）、四净（地净、场院净、道路净、秸棵打净）、五结合（在搞好秋收工作的同时，结合做好秋收分配、秋耕秋种、秋菜管理、秋季选种、秋季征购），力争做到农业和多种经营双丰收。
