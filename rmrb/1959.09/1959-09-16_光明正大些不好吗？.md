Isn't It Better to Be Open and Aboveboard?
　　Zēng Yīng

Probably to fuel the anti-China wave within India, some right-wing political parties and reactionary politicians in India led some of their lackeys in "demonstrations" in front of the Chinese Embassy and consulates. They shouted things like "Chinese robbers, get out of India!" and "Chinese imperialists, get out of India!" Look how "mighty" these people are. Of course, this should not be said to be the entirety of India's anti-China offensive, but it is the most vicious wing of that offensive.

"Imperialists get out!" This is a slogan that resonates around the world. The liberation movements of various nations will specify it according to different targets and different tasks of struggle. For example, "American imperialists get out of the Middle East!" "American imperialists get out of Taiwan!" "American imperialists get out of South Korea!" "American imperialists get out of Vietnam!" and so on. If there really is a so-called "Chinese imperialism" in the world, and it has really "occupied" or "invaded" some part of India, then shouting "Chinese imperialists get out of India!" would surely inspire people and arouse sympathy and righteous indignation around the world.

However, today a small group of Indian reactionaries desperately shouting such slogans is initially baffling, then turns laughable upon investigating the facts, and then becomes downright hateful upon further reflection.

What are the facts? First, the British imperialists seized some places in China, and then the British aggressors, behind the backs of the Chinese people, concocted a so-called "McMahon Line" that they dared not make public, secretly carving out a piece of China equivalent to the size of Zhejiang Province. The result of this robbery and theft created a long-standing historical dispute over the Sino-Indian border. Some people in India are envious of this ill-gotten wealth, unwilling to let go, and even want to fish in troubled waters to grab more, so they produced a map in which the so-called "McMahon Line" had even drifted further into Chinese territory. In fact, it's just a map, which wouldn't be a big deal. It is said that some reactionary parties in India have drawn maps that include China's Tibet within the borders of India. This of course demonstrates the ambition of those expansionist elements, but as long as no one sends troops to seize this "territory", we will only regard it as a small group of people's deliberately malicious act and scoff at it. Would anyone really go to war over such a fantastical map?

The important thing is that the problem should be resolved through friendly consultation. However, now the Indian army is impatiently "advancing" forward step by step. Not only has it crossed the original wishful thinking "McMahon Line", but it has also crossed the caricatured "McMahon Line" on Indian maps. And the Chinese army? It has never crossed the "McMahon Line". This is because we want to resolve border disputes through friendly consultation. Unexpectedly, this attitude of appeasement, tolerance, and friendship has attracted the slander of being called "robbers" and "imperialists," which is truly outrageous.

Please tell me, besides a small group of Tibetan bandits who are sheltered and harbored in Indian territory, is there any Chinese soldier on any piece of Indian territory? Where exactly should the "Chinese imperialists" get out to? What are Indian troops doing on Chinese territory? If we were to "give them a taste of their own medicine," shouldn't we return the favor in the same way?

However, we don't! We still maintain that both China and India should consider the historical background and the current actual situation, and comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations, based on the Five Principles, with preparation and in a step-by-step manner. None of us has waved our hands and shouted, "Indian imperialists get out of China!" Every word of Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of September 8th fully represents the will of the Chinese people, and every Chinese person firmly supports it. The reason we do this is not because we don't know how to march and demonstrate, or how to shout slogans, but because we are making the greatest effort to safeguard Sino-Indian friendship. Because we do not harbor the despicable conspiracies and malice of undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people by carrying out the will of Western imperialist masters, like that small group of Indian reactionaries. So, as our Premier Zhou said, we sincerely hope that the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border can be eased immediately, that the dark clouds looming over the relations between the two countries can quickly dissipate, so that friends who care about Sino-Indian friendly relations can be relieved, and that those who sow discord between China and India and create tension can be hit. Aren't these words very earnest and sincere? Which word isn't open and aboveboard?

Friends should treat each other with openness and integrity, with a high standard. For example, if you want something from someone and they don't give it to you, you shouldn't feel wronged and hurl insults at them, saying things like "breaking promises" and so on. This kind of behavior is unacceptable, no matter in front of people or behind their backs. Reason doesn't lie in loudness. Without reason, even if you scold others like a shrew, accusing them of being "robbers" and "imperialists," and even hatefully "overthrow Zhou Enlai," you can't shout out any truth other than exposing your own viciousness and meanness. Of course, there is a small group of people in India who are the die-hard lackeys of Western imperialism, who are not only not friends, but are also enemies of the Chinese and Indian people. Friends should take this as a warning.

    光明正大些不好吗？
    曾应
    大概是为了推动印度国内的反华浪潮吧，印度的一些右翼政党和反动政客率领他们一些喽罗，在中国大使馆和领事馆门前举行了“示威”。大喊什么“中国强盗滚出印度”，“中国帝国主义者滚出印度”等等。请看这些人多“威”风。当然不应该把这说成是印度反华攻势的全部，但它却是反华攻势最凶恶的一翼。
    “帝国主义滚出去”！这是一个通行世界的口号。各个民族的解放运动，都会根据不同的斗争对象不同的斗争任务，把它具体化。比如“美国帝国主义者滚出中东去！”“美国帝国主义者滚出台湾去！”“美国帝国主义者滚出南朝鲜去！”“美国帝国主义者滚出越南去！”等等。如果世界上真的有一个所谓“中国帝国主义”，而且又真的“侵占”或“侵略”了印度的什么地方，那末，大喊“中国帝国主义者滚出印度去”！一定也会振奋人心，激起全世界的同情和义愤的。
    不过，今天一小撮印度反动分子拚命大喊这样的口号，听起来先是叫人发懵，一查究事实，也就变为可笑，再想一想，简直有些可恨了。
    事实是怎样的呢？先是英帝国主义者抢占了中国的一些地方，接着英国侵略者背着中国人民搞了一条并不敢公开见人的所谓“麦克马洪线”，偷偷地就把中国一块相当于浙江省那么大的地方给划过去了。连抢带偷的结果，就造成了中印边界的长期历史纠纷。印度有些人对这不义之财有些眼红，不肯放手，还想混水摸鱼多抓一把，于是又出了一本地图，那条所谓的“麦克马洪线”，竟然又向中国境内游动了些。其实，只是地图，也还不要紧，据说，在印度有一些反动政党绘制的地图是把中国的西藏画在印度的疆界之内的，这当然表现了那些扩张主义分子的野心，但只要没有人派兵来收取这“领土”，我们也只当他作一小撮人的别具用心的恶行，嗤之以鼻罢了，难道谁还真的为这样一张狂想的地图去兴师动众吗？
    要紧的是对问题应该通过友好商谈解决。然而，如今是印度军队迫不及待地向前“节节进逼”了。逼还不算，还要枪弹嗖嗖嗖飞机哄哄哄。不仅越过了原来那个一相情愿的“麦克马洪线”，而且也越过了在印度地图上漫画化了的“麦克马洪线”。而中国军队呢？却还从来没有越出过那个“麦克马洪线”。这是因为我们想用友好地协商去解决边界纠纷。不料息事宁人，容忍友好的态度，竟招来了所谓“强盗”和“帝国主义者”的恶骂，这不真也是岂有此理吗？
    请问，除了被包庇和窝盘在印度领土上的一小撮西藏叛匪以外，哪一块印度领土上还有任何一个中国士兵？究竟要“中国帝国主义者”滚到哪里去呢？印度军队到中国领土上来作什么？如果“即以其人之道，还治其人之身”，我们岂不也该照样回敬一句吗？
    然而，我们并不！我们仍然主张中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。我们并没有谁挥手大喊过“印度帝国主义者滚出中国去”。周恩来总理9月8日的信件，每一个字都集中代表了我们中国人民的意志，我们每一个中国人都是坚决支持的。我们所以这样，并不是我们不会游行示威，不会喊口号，而是为了尽最大努力来维护中印友谊的。因为我们并不像那一小撮印度反动分子那样怀着执行西方帝国主义老爷意旨破坏中印人民友谊的卑鄙阴谋和恶意。所以我们正像我们周总理所说的那样，衷心希望中印边境的紧张局势能立刻缓和，笼罩着两国关系的阴云能迅速消散，使关心中印友好关系的朋友们得到宽怀，使挑拨中印关系、制造紧张局势的人受到打击。这些话难道不是十分语重心长的吗？哪一个字不是光明磊落的呢。
    朋友间共事，态度应该光明正大，堂堂正正，格调应该高一些。比如自己想要人家的东西，人家不给，不应因此便觉着自己好像受了委屈，对人家进行辱骂，说什么“背信食言”等等。这样做法，不论在人前背后都是说不过去的。有理不在声高嘛，没有理，即使像泼妇一样抢天嚎地的大骂别人是“强盗”，是“帝国主义者”，甚至还要恶恨恨地“打倒周恩来”，这除了暴露了自己的恶毒和卑鄙以外，是喊不出什么道理来的。当然，在印度有一小撮人是西方帝国主义的死走狗，不仅算不得朋友，而且是中国和印度人民的敌人。朋友们处事，是应该以此为戒的。
