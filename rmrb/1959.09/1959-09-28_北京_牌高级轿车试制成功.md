    "Beijing" Brand Luxury Sedan Successfully Trial-Produced
    (Our report) The Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which trial-produced the "Jinggangshan" brand sedan during the Great Leap Forward last year, recently completed the trial production of the "Beijing" brand luxury sedan. Three new prototypes have been manufactured as a gift to celebrate the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation. These three prototypes have each been test-driven for 1,000 kilometers at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour, proving that all parts of the car are of excellent quality.
    The "Beijing" brand luxury sedan features the latest technological structures, such as a V-shaped eight-cylinder engine, hydraulic automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, hydraulic valves, and three-layer alloy bearings. The maximum speed is 160 kilometers per hour. It is easy and convenient to operate, comfortable to ride in, and has a beautiful appearance.
    This factory, which leapt from an automobile parts factory to an automobile manufacturing plant during the Great Leap Forward last year, has vigorously prepared for production this year in conjunction with the formal trial production of the "Beijing" brand luxury sedan. It has now completed the design and verification of all drawings, processes, and other technical documents, manufactured more than 3,000 sets of tools, and renovated some equipment, creating technical and material conditions for small-batch production in the future. Currently, this factory is actively preparing for the small-batch production of "Beijing" brand sedans. (Attached picture)

    本报讯　去年大跃进中试制成“井岗山”牌小轿车的北京汽车制造厂，最近又完成了“北京”牌高级小轿车的试制工作，并且新制成三辆样车，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。这三辆样车都以时速一百六十公里的速度，分别进行了一千公里的试跑，证明全车各个部件都质量优良。
    “北京”牌高级轿车具有V形八缸发动机、液力全自动变速器、加力转向、加力刹车、液压汽门、三层合金轴瓦等最新技术结构。最大车速每小时一百六十公里。操纵简单，轻便，乘坐舒适，外形美观。
    这个在去年大跃进中从汽车附件厂跃为汽车制造厂的工厂，今年结合“北京”牌高级小轿车的正规试制工作，大力进行了生产准备。现在，已完成了全部图纸、工艺等技术文件的设计和验证工作，制造了三千多套工具，改造了部分设备，为今后小批生产创造了技术和物质条件。现在，这个厂正积极准备小批生产“北京”牌轿车。（附图片）
