The people of Hubei Province have established a strong confidence in "Man Will Conquer Nature": Guarantee increased production despite a hundred days of severe drought

    (Our dispatch) Hubei Province has been experiencing a severe drought for seventy days, with some counties nearing a hundred days, and the drought continues to worsen. Thanks to the strong leadership of the Party and the efforts of the broad masses, the fight against the drought has achieved great success, and the early rice and mid-season rice have basically yielded a bumper harvest.

    Since the publication of the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the rural areas of Hubei have universally criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres, thus further strengthening their confidence in "Man Will Conquer Nature" and increasing their enthusiasm for production. Some communes in Huanggang Prefecture that originally lacked confidence in ensuring a bumper harvest have now proposed "Not fearing the heavens, not fearing the earth, we must guarantee the plan even with a hundred days of severe drought"; places that originally believed that they could only guarantee the plan with the greatest effort, now, through mobilizing the masses, have discovered even greater potential for increased production, expressing their determination to overcome the disaster and exceed the plan; places that originally only intended to have a "small leap forward" are now trying every means to expand the area of late autumn crops and strive for a great leap forward.

    When discussing "guaranteeing the plan, exceeding the plan," all localities have put forward practical and feasible measures for increasing production. The original plan for the total grain output of Gong'an County this year was 580 million jin, but now they have proposed to strive to exceed the original plan by about 10%. The five specific measures proposed by the county to exceed the plan and exceed the total output are: First, the county's insured harvest area for single-season late rice will be increased from the original 210,000 mu to 229,000 mu, with a universal application of additional fertilizer to ensure water in every field; second, the more than 170,000 mu of double-season late rice must be resolutely ensured, not abandoning a single mu, and guaranteeing transplanting and harvesting; third, the county's 140,000 mu of soybeans must also be universally watered and insect-controlled; fourth, after the harvest of 100,000 mu of mid-season rice, regenerate rice should be universally cultivated, increasing production by another 200 jin of grain per mu; fifth, vigorously grasp the production of late autumn crops and vegetables. Many people's communes in Huanggang Prefecture have universally proposed to persist in fighting the drought to the end, striving for a large-scale balanced increase in production, and on the basis of ensuring the original production plan, to launch another "thousand, hundred, ten" production increase competition movement. (That is, with the commune or production team as the unit, in the autumn and winter seasons, each person produces an average of one thousand jin of vegetables, each mu of late autumn crops increases production by another one hundred jin of grain, and each member increases income by another ten yuan.)

    湖北人民树立“人定胜天”的坚强信心
    百日大旱也要保增产
    本报讯　湖北省大旱已经七十天，部分县已近百天，旱情仍在继续发展。由于党的坚强领导和广大群众的干劲，抗旱斗争已取得了很大胜利，早稻、中稻基本丰收。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议公布以来，湖北各地农村普遍批判了某些干部的右倾保守思想，因而更加坚定了“人定胜天”的信心，生产干劲越来越大。黄冈专区各县一些原来没有信心确保丰收的公社，现在已经提出了“天不怕，地不怕，大旱百日也要保规划”；原来认为尽最大努力只能保规划的地方，现在通过发动群众，挖掘出来更多更大的增产潜力，表示决心抗灾超规划；原来只打算来个“小小跃进”的地方，现在千方百计扩大晚秋面积，争取来一个大大的跃进。
    各地讨论“保规划、超规划”时，都提出了切实可行的增产措施。公安县今年原订的全县粮食总产量为五亿八千万斤，现在他们又提出要争取超过原规划的10％左右。这个县提出超规划、超总产的五项具体措施是：一、全县一季晚稻保收面积由原来二十一万亩增加到二十二万九千亩，普遍多追一次肥，保证块块田里有水；二、十七万多亩双季晚稻，坚决做到一亩不丢，保插保收；三、全县十四万亩黄豆也要普遍浇水、除虫；四、十万亩中稻收割后，普遍蓄好再生稻，每亩再增产二百斤谷；五、大抓晚秋作物和蔬菜生产。黄冈专区许多人民公社，普遍提出坚持抗旱到底，争取大面积平衡增产，在确保原有生产规划的基础上，再来一个“千、百、十”的增产竞赛运动。（即以公社或生产队为单位，在秋冬两季内平均每人生产千斤蔬菜，每亩晚秋再增产一百斤粮，每个社员再增加十元的收入。）
