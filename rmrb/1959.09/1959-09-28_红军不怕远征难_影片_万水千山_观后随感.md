The Long March is a heart-stirring historical event. It encourages millions of fighters and builders to march towards socialism and communism with even greater bravery and heroism… This heart-stirring historical event, now adapted from Chen Qitong's play of the same name, "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains," is vividly reproduced on the screen. It will undoubtedly give people who are advancing even greater excitement and strength.

The film describes the most important and prominent segments of the 25,000-li Long March: rushing across the Iron Chain Bridge; crossing Jiajin Mountain; traversing the vast grasslands; capturing Lazikou Pass… Many shots are dazzling; many scenes are magnificent and moving. After the film, the torches on the march, the waves on the Dadu River, the flames at the Iron Chain Bridge, the wind and snow on Jiajin Mountain, the hailstones on the swampy grasslands… still leap before my eyes. And the arm that grabbed the iron chain and refused to let go after being wounded; the marching pot shaking on the snowy peak; the singing of the Internationale when hungry and cold; the red flag that instructor Li Guoyou unfolded after closing his eyes… still churn within me!

The film fully demonstrates the revolutionary optimism of us communists. No matter how dangerous the journey, no matter how difficult the environment, everyone is still full of confidence and marches forward with heads held high. There is a gong and drum team on the top of Jiajin Mountain; a living newspaper performance on the grasslands where horses sink; jokes are still told while eating wild vegetables and leather belts… No dangerous situation can make the communists shrink, and no difficulty can discourage the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Because in the depths of everyone's heart, there resounds such a voice: We are engaged in the most beautiful cause of mankind; we are creating a brand new history!

Our cause is the most beautiful, and our proletarian ranks are forever united. This great spirit of unity has created a completely new relationship between people. Look at the details shown in the film! Even when seriously ill, the instructor still gives his horse to the soldiers to ride; the communication soldier is sad to tears because he discovers that the rice bag is empty and cannot find food or wild vegetables to feed the leaders; when everyone is hungry and exhausted, the leader kills his own mount and sends pieces of horse meat to the soldiers… These details all contain the extremely moving and rich great spirit of unity of the proletarian revolutionary ranks. How can such an army, loving each other, caring for each other, and encouraging each other, not crush all obstacles and advance bravely!

There is unity within the army, and there is also unity between the army and the people. Regardless of Han, Yi, or Tibetan, our revolutionary soldiers regard them as their own brothers and sisters, their own relatives. Caring for the interests of the people everywhere and respecting local customs everywhere. Therefore, wherever the army goes, it will receive the love and support of the people and generate flesh-and-blood emotions. The film also has a deeper expression in this regard. A guide who left his hometown took the Red Army for a distance, and he was so moved that he no longer wanted to go back. He rolled down the snow-capped mountain with the Red Army, and he sat in the snow nest and asked to join the revolution. Instructor Li Guoyou was wounded for a period in the home of Tibetan people, which made the Tibetan old man unwilling to part with him. At parting, he insisted on giving his only horse to him, to the Red Army… These moving scenes in the film are hard to forget.

The Long March, in this 25,000-li long journey, every footprint, every road sign, contains countless touching deeds. It is impossible to describe it in detail with ten reels of film. Now the film only captures a few of the most important and prominent scenes, but I feel that some places are too brief, while others are too protracted. When passing Lazikou Pass, there are only a few shots and guns; but when passing through the grasslands, too much ink is used, which is a bit dull. In addition, the transitions between each scene still have a feeling of being parallel and discontinuous, lacking profound events that are related to people's destiny and the future, to entangle, to run through, to promote, and to set off waves and climaxes. Now, it seems that some main characters, such as Battalion Commander Zhao Zhifang and Propaganda Officer Li Fenglian, are also doing their work and moving forward, but their personalities and emotions have not been well displayed.

"Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains"! Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and finally passed through such arduous ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, and finally established today's radiant People's China. How proud and joyful this is! Of course, on our continued road to socialism and communism, there will still be new and different "ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains," but as long as we remember the example of the great warriors praised by Chairman Mao, "The Red Army fears not the trials of the Long March, holding light ten thousand crags and torrents," then we will surely overcome everything and win everything!

    红军不怕远征难
    ——影片“万水千山”观后随感
    顾工
    长征，是件撼动人心的史实。它鼓舞着千千万万战斗者、建设者、更英勇更豪迈地走向社会主义，共产主义……。这件撼动人心的史实，今天又根据陈其通同名话剧“万水千山”加以改编，在银幕上生动地再现出来，它定会给前进的人们，更大的激动、更大的力量。
    影片描述了两万五千里漫长的征途中，最主要，最突出的几个片断：冲过铁索桥；翻越夹金山；横穿大草地；攻破腊子口……。许多镜头，都光彩夺目；许多画面，都壮丽动人。电影放完后，那进军路上的火把，大渡河上的波涛，铁索桥头的火焰，夹金山上的风雪，水草地上的冰雹……仍然在我眼前跃动。还有那负伤后抓住铁索不肯松开的手臂；在雪峰上晃动的行军锅；饥寒交迫时唱出的国际歌声；教导员李国有闭上眼睛后铺开的红旗……仍然在我内心翻腾！
    影片充分显示了我们共产主义者的革命乐观主义的精神。无论征途多么艰险，无论环境多么困苦，大家仍然信心满怀，昂首阔步。在夹金山顶还有锣鼓队；在陷没马匹的草地上还演活报剧；在吃野菜、吃皮带的时候还在讲笑话……。什么险境也不能使共产党人畏缩，什么困难也不会使工农红军气馁。因为在每个人的内心深处，都震响着这样的声音：我们在从事着人类最美好的事业；我们在创造一部崭新的历史！
    我们的事业是最美好的，我们无产阶级的队伍永远是团结的。这种伟大的团结精神，产生了全新的人与人之间的关系。看看影片中表现出来的这些细节吧！教导员即使在重病的时候，仍然把马让给战士来骑，通讯员因为发现米袋空了，一时又搞不到粮食、野菜给首长充饥，而难过得哭泣；在大家都饥困的时候，领导人杀了自己的坐骑，给战士们送去了一块块马肉……。这些细节，都包含着极其动人，极其丰富的无产阶级革命队伍团结一致的伟大精神。这样一支相互友爱，相互关怀，相互鼓舞的军队，怎能不踏碎一切阻难，奋勇前进！
    有着军队内部的团结，还有着军队和人民间的团结。不分汉族、彝族、藏族，我们革命战士都把他看作是自己的兄弟、自己的亲人。处处关心人民的利益，处处尊重地方的风俗。所以军队不论走到那里，都会得到人民的爱戴、支持，并产生血肉相连的情感。影片在这方面也有着较深刻的表现。一个离开家乡的响导，带着红军走了一段路，他就感动得再不愿回去了，他和红军一起滚下雪山，他坐在雪窝里要求参加革命。教导员李国有在藏族人民的家里，养了一个时期的伤，就使得藏族老人再也不愿和他分手，临别时，硬要把自己唯一的一匹马送给他，送给红军……。影片中的这些动人的场面，都很难使人淡忘。
    长征，在这两万五千里的漫漫途程中，每个脚印、每个路标，都蕴藏着无数感人的事迹，要想用十本胶片，把它描述详尽，那是难以做到的。现在影片只抓住了几个最主要最突出的场景，但感到有些地方还是太简略了一些，而有些地方又太拖沓了一些。过腊子口时，只是几声枪炮；而过草地时，却用墨过多，稍嫌沉闷。另外，每个场景和场景之间的变换，还有些平列、断续的感觉，缺少深刻关系着人们命运和未来的事件，来交缠、来贯串、来推进、来掀起波澜和高潮。现在看来，有些主要人物，如营长赵志芳、宣传员李凤莲，虽然也在做工作，也在向前走，但他们的性格、他们的情感，却未能得到很好展示。
    “万水千山”啊！毛主席、党中央领导着工农红军，终于通过了那样艰辛的万水千山，终于建立了今天这样光芒万丈的人民中国。这是多么值得自豪、多么值得欢呼！当然在我们继续向社会主义、共产主义前进的道路上，仍然会有新的不同的“万水千山”，但是只要我们忆起毛主席所歌颂的“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的伟大战士们的榜样，那么我们就一定能战胜一切，赢得一切！
