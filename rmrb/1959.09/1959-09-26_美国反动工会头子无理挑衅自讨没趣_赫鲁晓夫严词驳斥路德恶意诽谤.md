Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. According to TASS on the 24th, the press group accompanying the Chairman of the Council of Ministers published a communique on Khrushchev's talk with American labor union leaders in San Francisco on September 21, 1959. The communique stated that on September 21, 1959, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, met with a group of leaders of the American labor movement in San Francisco. This meeting took place at the initiative of some individuals in the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).
As previously reported, the meeting lasted more than three hours, sometimes very intense, and involved certain issues related to the international situation and Soviet-American relations.
American newspapers published many contradictory reports about this meeting.
The source of information about the meeting was a press conference held late at night by American union leaders immediately after parting with Khrushchev. From newspaper reports, it can be seen that AFL-CIO Vice President Reuther fabricated wildly at the press conference, seriously distorted the speech of the head of the Soviet government, and attributed things to the head of the Soviet government that did not actually happen. According to the San Francisco "Examiner," the president of the United Textile Workers of America, Leif, and the president of the National Maritime Union, Curran, who attended the meeting, told reporters: "A considerable part of Reuther's account of the meeting is nonsense."
In order to clarify the truth, the press group accompanying the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union published a summary of the aforementioned conversation, because the main arguments of this conversation were concealed from the public by some American newspapers, or were deliberately distorted by some American newspapers.

	The Soviet Union Treats Underdeveloped Countries as Friends, Providing Assistance
	American Monopoly Capital Exploits the Wealth of Underdeveloped Countries
At the beginning of the conversation, AFL-CIO Vice Presidents Carey and Reuther stated that they and their colleagues were very interested in frankly exchanging views on pressing major international issues. Carey and others who attended the meeting asked Khrushchev to talk about the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals. However, the American union leaders did not wait for an answer and began to raise other questions, including the issue of economic assistance to underdeveloped countries.
In answering these questions, Khrushchev reminded the interlocutors that the Soviet government's proposal to the United Nations on complete and thorough disarmament stipulated that a certain percentage of the funds freed up by the reduction of armaments should be allocated, so this proposal would be able to assist underdeveloped countries.
Khrushchev said, "But we cannot wait for a disarmament agreement to be reached. We are already providing huge economic assistance to underdeveloped countries. On the one hand, we assist them through the United Nations: allocating funds, providing medical assistance, and food assistance. On the other hand, we assist them based on bilateral agreements."
Reuther interrupted Khrushchev, attempting to slander the Soviet Union's policy of providing assistance to economically underdeveloped countries. Reuther even accused the Soviet Union of using assistance to underdeveloped countries to achieve the selfish goal of conducting a "cold war."
Khrushchev refuted this attack, saying, "You are pointing your arrows in the wrong direction. The Soviet Union has never exploited anyone, and it will not now. The Soviet Union treats underdeveloped countries as friends and provides assistance to them without imposing any political conditions on them." "Now look at what the imperialists are doing. American monopoly capital is exploiting the wealth of underdeveloped countries and using this method to obtain huge amounts of capital. Britain, France, and other capitalist countries are also doing this kind of thing."
Reuther was unable to refute Khrushchev's arguments, but suddenly shouted: "You are exploiting the people of East Germany." This statement even made Reuther's colleagues laugh.

	The Soviet Union's Disarmament Proposals Aim to Ensure Peace, Not Propaganda
	Reuther's Repetition of Trite Arguments Shows He is Deeply Corrupted by Monopoly Capital
Next, the topic turned to disarmament. Reuther and some other union leaders repeated the arguments of the bourgeois newspapers, saying that the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament was merely for propaganda, and that the Soviet Union's military expenditure was the same as that of the United States, also $40 billion a year.
Khrushchev replied to this point: "First, the expenses we spend on national defense, if converted into your money, are not $40 billion, but $25 billion. Second, when I hear you say that the Soviet Union's proposal is propaganda, I, a former miner, begin to look at you with contempt. It is said that you come from the working class, but what you say is like an agent of a capitalist. I can understand Hearst publishing such things. But an American union leader is also repeating this kind of argument, which makes me painfully think about how deeply the monopolists have corrupted you!"
However, Reuther continued to repeat the old arguments of reactionary propaganda organizations that distorted the Soviet Union's proposals. For example, he said that the Soviet Union's disarmament plan did not stipulate the establishment of supervision.
Khrushchev asked, why are you so familiar with Dulles' arguments, but so ignorant of the Soviet Union's position? We advocate all-encompassing supervision, but how should this supervision be organized? The United States proposes to implement supervision first, and then talk about disarmament. Under the conditions that the United States still surrounds us with military bases, supervision without disarmament can only mean one thing—military reconnaissance. And we propose to organize phased supervision, based on the state of implementation of disarmament.
Reuther was eager to raise new questions, so he asked Leif to speak. The latter raised some questions: about the role of state ownership in capitalist and socialist countries; about democracy and dictatorship; about the control of publications and radio stations; and about the exchange of information, etc. At this time, he still repeated hostile propaganda attacks against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.
Khrushchev said that the questions raised by Leif were elementary questions, which were studied in Soviet primary political groups.

	The Dictatorship of the Working Class Itself is the Highest Form of Democracy
	Reuther and Curran and Others Use American Standards to Measure, Naturally Difficult to Understand
Reuther obviously wanted to intensify the conversation, so he raised another question: "Does state ownership necessarily require the establishment of a dictatorship that excludes democracy?"
When Khrushchev answered Leif's question, he clarified the difference between state ownership in a socialist country where the means of production are owned by the whole people, and state ownership in a capitalist country (where the nationalization of the means of production places the means of production in the hands of the bourgeoisie, which is the ruling class).
Khrushchev explained that in clarifying this or that social system, a fundamental question is to whom does the political power belong: does it belong to the working class, the working people, or does it belong to the exploiting classes? If the political power belongs to the people, then the means of production are socialist public ownership. If the nationalization of the means of production is realized under the circumstances that the political power belongs to the capitalists, that is another matter. Khrushchev said that the Communists are advocates of the dictatorship of the working class, because only after the political power is transferred to the hands of the working people can the task of socialist construction be victoriously realized. The dictatorship of the working class not only does not exclude democracy, but also creates all the conditions for developing true democracy. The dictatorship of the working class itself is the highest form of democracy.
The president of the National Maritime Union, Curran, asked whether Soviet workers have the right to strike? How do trade unions protect the interests of workers?
Khrushchev said, "I understand what you mean, and I am satisfied that you have class sensitivity in dealing with the issue of trade union work. But you obviously have no idea about the conditions in socialist countries, the situation of the working class in socialist countries, and the role of trade unions. You are using the American standards that you are accustomed to measuring everything."
Khrushchev said to Curran: "I like your questions being asked frankly. I am also answering this question directly. In the first few years after the October Revolution, we had strikes there. During the strikes, I personally talked to the workers. Now our workers do not strike. Why? If you recall certain facts, you can find the answer to this question yourself. The government does not need workers to put pressure on it to formulate plans to improve the material welfare of the working class."
Reuther turned to a new issue, and this time he asked Knight to speak.
Knight raised two questions. He very presumptuously raised the so-called "issue of free elections in Germany." This union figure also expressed his opinion on the so-called "Hungarian issue" in the same tone.

	The Hungarian People Have Achieved Great Achievements in Construction After Putting Down the Rebellion
	Reuther's Surprising Ignorance but Pretending to be the "Protector" of the Hungarian People
Khrushchev refuted the fallacies about the "so-called free elections in Germany" and resolutely countered the attempt to re-raise the so-called "Hungarian issue."
In discussing this issue, Mr. Reuther could not help but reveal surprising ignorance. He began to "defend" Comrade János Kádár, saying that he was... a bourgeois nationalist. Only after his colleagues burst out laughing, implying that he should say Imre Nagy, did Reuther clumsily correct himself.
Khrushchev said when exposing the hypocritical position of this "protector" of the Hungarian people:
"The Hungarian People's Republic has its own constitution, its own laws, and a legitimate government elected in a democratic way. It is developing freely and has made great achievements in socialist construction. What happened in Hungary in 1956? There was a rebellion by anti-people elements who were dissatisfied with the political power of the working people. The Hungarian counter-revolutionaries, instigated by international reactionary forces, attempted to overthrow the socialist system. At the same time, the conspirators also used weapons obtained from the West. The instructions they followed also came from there. During the few days that the counter-revolutionaries seized power in Budapest, they began to act recklessly and kill upright people.
At this difficult moment, the Hungarian revolutionary government headed by János Kádár requested our assistance. We fulfilled this request, and we are proud of it. If we had not helped the people's government headed by Kádár, the fascists would have seized political power in Hungary. We gave fraternal assistance to the Hungarian people and helped them against the fascist rebels, which is fulfilling our internationalist duty."

	The Soviet Union Values Freedom of Thought and Creative Development
	The United States Encourages the Spread of Lewd and Debauched "Freedom"
The president of the United Papermakers and Paperworkers, Phillips, proposed to move on to another topic and re-raised the demand, raised more than once by bourgeois figures in the United States during their meeting with Khrushchev, for the free dissemination of reactionary books and anti-Soviet news in the Soviet Union.
Khrushchev said: "Here someone has raised this to me many times, and I have answered it every time. It seems that you are not satisfied with my answer, and you want to hear something else. What can we do if we have different understandings of freedom than you do? When we were in Hollywood, someone showed us the 'Can-Can' dance. When dancing this dance, the girls have to lift their skirts and show their buttocks, and this dance must be performed by decent good actors. People force them to suit the tastes of those lewd people. Some people here watch this kind of performance, but when we Soviets see this scene, we have to walk away. Because it is pornography. It is the culture of people who are full and have nothing to do, lewd and debauched.
Performing this kind of film is called freedom here. This kind of 'freedom' is not suitable for us. Obviously, you like to watch the 'freedom' of buttocks. And we would rather have the freedom of thought, the freedom of thinking, and the freedom of creative development."
Khrushchev pointed out that Weaver, a black man present, had repeatedly expressed his desire to ask questions, but for some reason, Reuther had simply not noticed him.
Khrushchev said, "You are not presiding over the discussion democratically, please let the black man speak. Know that doing so is a disgrace. Even today, there are still some places here where black people are not allowed to enter!"

	The Trade Unions of the Soviet Union and the United States Must Establish More Frequent Contact
	Work Together for the Common Cause of Defending World Peace
Weaver asked Khrushchev, where should we start and how can we find a basis for cooperation between the trade unions of the United States and the Soviet Union. Weaver said, "It is very important for our people to have the questions raised at today's meeting answered."
Khrushchev replied, "I think that trade unions must establish more frequent contact. Of course, not all problems can be solved at once. But if the trade unions start to develop and strengthen cooperation on some individual, even some small issues at first, then the two countries will eventually reach the point of working together. You may not understand the position of our trade unions all at once, just as our trade union workers cannot understand all of your things all at once. Therefore, we and you must look at each other more closely, examine each other's activities, and better understand each other's activities. We and you may have disputes, and we may not be able to reach agreements with each other, but if we all hope to strengthen peace and improve the lives of workers and working people, then why should we make relations tense? Know that this will only benefit our common enemy.
Do you want to change our socialist system? I hope not! We also do not want to, and will not interfere in your internal affairs—we will not try to change your existing system. We have said this in the past and we say it now: let us show tolerance in our mutual relations. Although we have differences with you on many issues, we have a common cause, for which we should work together. This is to fight for peace. The people of all countries want peace and are fighting for peace."
AFL-CIO Vice President Carey thanked Khrushchev for the meeting near the end of the discussion.
After all of this, it is impossible not to be surprised that Reuther immediately held a press conference after the meeting and crudely distorted the essence of the conversation. He even said that Khrushchev "slammed the table and shouted: 'I am the dictator of the working class'" during the conversation.
This slander is obviously used to deceive those who have no knowledge of the Soviet Union and Soviet leaders. No wonder many bourgeois journalists asked Khrushchev how he viewed Mr. Reuther's extremely incredible report on that conversation.
Khrushchev replied, "If Mr. Reuther said that, then his behavior was dishonest. This is a lie. I cannot respect people who play this kind of trick."

What are the results of the meeting between the American workers' leaders and the Soviet government head?
The fact of this meeting itself shows that the American political situation is beginning to change in a good direction. Although some leaders of the American trade unions have strong anti-Soviet sentiments, the American people's growing desire to improve relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and strengthen peace is prevailing.
It is regrettable that some reactionary trade union leaders in the United States are trying to create a tense atmosphere at a time when Soviet-American relations are improving somewhat and the international situation is improving somewhat.
No matter how reactionary American trade union leaders try to conceal the Soviet government head's call for unity, try to distort his words, the truth cannot be concealed. The following facts also illustrate this point: the Soviet government head was warmly welcomed by the American people along the way during his visits to various places. In these enthusiastic welcoming occasions, the American people's desire for peace and friendship with the Soviet people was truly revealed.

    美国反动工会头子无理挑衅自讨没趣
    赫鲁晓夫严词驳斥路德恶意诽谤
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社24日讯，部长会议主席随行新闻组发表了赫鲁晓夫1959年9月21日在旧金山同美国工会领袖谈话的公报。公报说，1959年9月21日，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在旧金山会见了一批美国工人运动的领导人。这次会晤是在美国劳动联合会—产业工会联合会（劳联—产联）中某些人士的倡议下进行的。
    前已报道，这次座谈持续了三个多小时，有时很激烈，座谈过程中涉及到国际局势和苏美关系方面的某些问题。
    美国报纸关于这次会晤发表了许多互相矛盾的报道。
    关于会晤情况的消息来源是美国工会领导人同赫鲁晓夫分手后立即在深夜所举行的记者招待会。从报纸报道中可以看出，劳联—产联副主席路德在记者招待会上大肆虚构捏造，严重地歪曲了苏联政府首脑的讲话，并且把实际上没有过的东西强加在苏联政府首脑的身上。据旧金山的“考察报”说，参加会晤的联合纺织工人工会主席李夫和全国海员工会主席寇兰对记者们说：“路德关于座谈情况的讲法有相当大一部分是胡说八道”。
    为了阐明真象，苏联部长会议主席随行新闻组公布了上述谈话的摘要，因为这次谈话的主要论点被某些美国报纸向公众隐瞒了，或者是被某些美国报纸别有用心地加以歪曲了。
        苏联把不发达国家当作朋友给以援助
        美国垄断资本却剥削不发达国家财富
    劳联—产联两个副主席凯雷和路德在谈话一开始时说，他们和他们的同事们非常有兴趣就迫切的重大国际问题坦率地交换意见。凯雷和其他参加会晤的人请求赫鲁晓夫讲一讲苏联的新裁军建议。但是，美国工会领袖没有等到回答，就开始提出另外的问题，其中有关于对不发达国家的经济援助的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答这些问题时，提醒交谈者说，苏联政府向联合国提出的关于全面彻底裁军的建议规定从由于裁减军备所腾出来的资金中拨出一定比例的钱，因此这个建议就能够援助不发达国家。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“但是我们不能等待达成裁军协议。我们现在就已经在对不发达国家给予巨大的经济援助。一方面，我们通过联合国援助他们：调拨资金、给予医疗援助和粮食援助。另一方面，我们根据双边协议援助他们。”
    路德打断赫鲁晓夫的话，企图诽谤苏联的对经济上不发达的国家给予援助的政策。路德竟然责难苏联，说它利用援助不发达国家来达到进行“冷战”的自私自利的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥这种攻击时说：“你们箭头的方向指错了。苏联过去和现在从来没有剥削过任何人。苏联把不发达国家当作朋友给以援助，没有对它们提出任何政治条件。”“现在你看一看，帝国主义者在干些什么。美国垄断资本在剥削不发达国家的财富，并用这种办法获得巨额 的资本。英国、法国和其他资本主义国家也在干这种勾当。”
    路德无法反驳赫鲁晓夫的论据，可是突然大叫道：“你们在剥削东德人民”。这种说法甚至使路德的同行都感到好笑。
        苏联裁军建议旨在保障和平并非宣传
        路德弹滥调表明他深受垄断资本腐蚀
    接着，话题转到裁军问题上。路德还有其他某些工会领袖重弹资产阶级报纸的论调，说什么苏联提出全面和彻底裁军计划仅仅是为了宣传，并说什么苏联的军费开支和美国的一样，也是每年四百亿美元。
    赫鲁晓夫对这一点回答说：“第一，我们花在国防上的费用，如果合成你们的钱，不是四百亿美元，而是二百五十亿美元。第二，当我听到您说苏联的建议是宣传的时候，我这个过去的矿工就开始以鄙夷的眼光来看您。据说，您出身于工人阶级，而您讲的话却像一个资本家的代理人。赫斯特登载这样的东西，我是可以理解的。而一个美国工会的领袖也在重弹这种调子，这就使得我痛心地想到，垄断资本家把您腐蚀到了什么程度！”
    但是，路德仍然重弹反动宣传机构歪曲苏联建议的老调。例如，他说什么苏联的裁军计划没有规定建立监督。
    赫鲁晓夫问道，您为什么对杜勒斯的论点知道得这样清楚，而对苏联的立场却这样无知？我们主张无所不包的监督，但是这种监督应当如何组织呢？美国建议先实行监督，而后才谈裁军。在美国还用军事基地包围我们的条件下，不裁军的监督只能意味着一点——军事侦察。而我们则建议组织分阶段的监督，根据裁军实施的状况来分阶段。
    路德急于提出新的问题，于是请李夫发言。后者提出了一些问题：关于国有制在资本主义国家和社会主义国家的作用；关于民主和独裁；关于对刊物和电台的控制以及关于交换情报等等。这时他仍然重复了针对苏联和其他社会主义国家的敌意宣传攻击。
    赫鲁晓夫说，李夫提出的问题是起码的问题，在苏联，这是初级政治小组研究的东西。
      工人阶级专政本身就是民主的最高形式
      路德寇兰之流用美国尺度衡量自难理解
    路德显然是想使谈话激烈起来，于是又提出了一个问题：“国家所有制是否一定要求建立排斥民主的专政呢？”
    当赫鲁晓夫回答李夫的问题时，阐明了生产资料为全民所有的社会主义国家的国家所有制与资本主义国家（在这里，生产资料的国有化使生产资料掌握在作为统治阶级的资产阶级的手中）的国家所有制之间的区别。
    赫鲁晓夫解释说，在阐明这种或那种社会制度时，一个根本的问题就是政权属于谁的问题：是属于工人阶级、劳动人民呢，还是属于剥削阶级呢。如果政权属于人民，那么生产资料就是社会主义全民所有制。如果生产资料的国有化是在政权属于资本家的情况下实现的，那就是另外一回事了。赫鲁晓夫说，共产党人是工人阶级专政的拥护者，因为只有在政权转入劳动人民手中后，才能胜利地实现社会主义建设的任务。工人阶级专政不仅不排斥民主，而且为发扬真正的民主制造了一切条件。工人阶级专政本身就是民主的最高形式。
    全国海员工会主席寇兰问到苏联工人是否有罢工的权利？工会如何保护劳动者的利益？
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我理解您的意思，我感到满意的是，您对待工会工作的问题有阶级敏感性。但是您显然完全没有想像到社会主义国家的条件、在社会主义国家中工人阶级的状况和工会的作用。您在用您所习惯的美国的尺度来衡量一切。”
    赫鲁晓夫对寇兰说：“我喜欢您的问题提得坦率。我回答这个问题也是直截了当的。在十月革命后的头几年，我们那里有过罢工。在罢工的时候，我还亲自同工人们谈过话。现在我们的工人们不罢工了。为什么呢？如果您回想某些事实的话，您就能自己找到这个问题的答案。政府不需工人对它施加压力而制订提高工人阶级物质福利的计划。”
    路德转到一个新问题，这回他请奈特发言。
    奈特提出了两个问题。他很放肆地提出了举行所谓“德国自由选举的问题”。这个工会人士还以同样的口吻就所谓的“匈牙利问题”发表意见。
    匈牙利人民平定叛乱后在建设中成就巨大
    路德惊人无知却伪装匈牙利人民“保护者”
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥了关于“所谓德国自由选举”问题的谬论，并坚决反击了重新提出所谓“匈牙利问题”的企图。
    在讨论这个问题时，路德先生不由地表露了惊人的无知。他开始为卡达尔·亚诺什同志“辩护”，说他是……资产阶级民族主义者。只是在他的同行放声哈哈大笑，暗示他应当说纳吉·伊姆雷之后，路德才笨拙地纠正过来。
    赫鲁晓夫在揭穿这位匈牙利人民的“保护者”的伪善立场时说：
    “匈牙利人民共和国有自己的宪法、自己的法律和用民主方式选出的合法政府。它在自由地发展着，并在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。在1956年，匈牙利发生了什么呢？那里发生了对劳动人民政权不满的反人民分子的叛乱。匈牙利反革命在国际反动势力的唆使下，企图推翻社会主义制度。同时阴谋分子还利用了从西方获得的武器。他们遵从的指令也是从那里来的。反革命分子夺取的布达佩斯政权的几天中间，开始胡作非为，杀戮正直的人。
    在这个艰难的时刻，以卡达尔·亚诺什为首的匈牙利革命政府请求我们援助。我们完成了这个请求，而我们也以此引为自豪。要是我们不去帮助以卡达尔为首的人民政府，法西斯分子就会夺去匈牙利的政权。我们对匈牙利人民给以兄弟帮助，帮助他们反对法西斯叛乱分子，这就是尽了自己的国际主义职责”。
        苏联重视思想和创造性发展的自由
        美国却鼓励散布淫乱放荡的“自由”
    联合造纸工人工会主席菲利普斯提议转入另一个题目，并重新提出资产阶级人士在美国同赫鲁晓夫会晤时不只一次提出过的关于在苏联自由散布反动书刊和反苏消息的要求。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“在这里有人已经向我提过好多次，我每次都作了回答。看来，您不满意我的回答，您希望听到别的东西。我们同你们对自由有不同的理解，怎么办呢？当我们在好莱坞的时候，有人给我们看了‘坎坎’舞。跳这种舞时，姑娘们得撩起裙子，露出屁股，而且这种舞还必须让正派的好演员来演。人们迫使她们适合那些淫乱人的口味。在你们这里有人看这种表演，而我们苏联人一看到这种场面，就要走开的。因为这是色情。这是吃饱了没事干、淫乱放荡的人的文化。
    上演这种影片，在你们这里叫做自由。这样的‘自由’对我们是不适合的。显然，你们喜欢看屁股的‘自由’。而我们宁肯要思想的自由、思考的自由和创造性发展的自由。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在场的黑人韦弗尔曾经多次表示想要提问题，但是，不知为什么路德却硬是没有发现他。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“您没有在民主地主持座谈，请让黑人说话吧。要知道这样做是一种耻辱。直到如今，你们这里还有一些地方是不许黑人进去的！”
        苏美两国工会必须更经常地建立接触
        为保卫世界和平的共同事业共同努力
    韦弗尔问赫鲁晓夫，应从何处着手，怎样才能找到美苏两国工会合作的基础。韦弗尔说，“对我国人民来说，在今天的座谈会上所提出的问题得到回答是很重要的。”
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，“我认为，工会必须更经常地建立接触。当然，不是一下子就解决所有问题。但是如果各工会在一些个别的，最初那怕是一些不大的问题上开始发展和加强合作，那末，两国终究会达到共同努力的地步。你可能不会一下子理解我们工会的立场，就像我们的工会工作者不能一下子理解你们的所有东西一样。所以，我们和你们都必须更接近地彼此看看、考察考察彼此的活动和更好地了解彼此的活动。我们同你们可能发生争论，也可能彼此不能达成协议，但是，如果我们大家希望加强和平、改善工人和劳动人民的生活，那末，我们为什么要把关系搞得紧张起来呢？要知道，这只会有利于我们共同的敌人。
    你们想改变我们的社会主义制度吗？我希望不是这样！我们也不想，而且也不会干涉你们的内政——不会设法改变你们现有的制度。我们过去和现在都这样说：让我们在相互的关系中表现出容忍的态度吧。尽管在许多问题上我们同你们有分歧，但我们有着共同的事业，为了这个事业我们应当共同努力。这就是为和平而奋斗。各国人民希望和平，并在为和平而斗争。”
    劳联—产联副主席凯雷在座谈快结束时，感谢赫鲁晓夫的会见。
    在这一切之后不能不令人感到惊奇的是，路德在会晤之后立刻举行了一个记者招待会，粗暴地歪曲了谈话的实质。他甚至说，赫鲁晓夫在谈话时“拍桌大叫：‘我是工人阶级的独裁者’”。
    这种诽谤显然是用来欺骗那些对苏联和苏联领导人毫无见识的人。难怪许多资产阶级记者要问赫鲁晓夫怎样看待路德先生关于那次谈话的极其令人难以置信的报道。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，“如果路德先生那样说过，那他的行为就不诚实了。这是撒谎。我不能尊重耍这种手段的人。”
                    *　　*　　*
    美国工人领袖同苏联政府首脑会晤的结果如何呢？
    这次会晤的事实本身表明，美国的政治局面开始往好的方向变化。尽管美国工会的某些领导人有强烈的反苏情绪，美国人民对改善美苏两国关系和加强和平的不断增强的愿望是占上风的。
    正当苏美关系有些改善，国际局势有些好转的时候，美国的一些反动工会领袖却企图制造紧张气氛，这不能不令人感到遗憾。
    不管美国反动工会领袖怎样企图掩盖苏联政府首脑提出的团结的号召，企图歪曲他的言论，真理是掩盖不了的。下面的事实也说明了这点：苏联政府首脑在各地访问期间，沿途都受到美国人满腔热情地欢迎。在这些热烈欢迎的场合中，美国人民渴望和平和同苏联人民友好的愿望真正地流露出来了。
