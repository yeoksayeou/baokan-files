    Report from Moscow, September 13th: The construction site of the Tom-Usinsk Thermal Power Plant on the Tom River in the southern Kuzbass is one of the key projects in the Soviet Union's vigorous development of thermal power plant construction and the development of the eastern region.

    This thermal power plant, with an initial planned generating capacity of 1.1 million kilowatts, is currently under construction at an extremely rapid pace.

    A few years ago, this place was still a desolate wasteland, but today, new industrial buildings have emerged one after another. More than two thousand workers from all over the Soviet Union are working day and night on this vast construction site. The competition to obtain the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" is in full swing, and so far eleven work teams have won this glorious title. Among them, the Sokolov work team has been particularly outstanding in its labor achievements. They frequently complete two or three times their work quotas, and each worker has mastered two basic skills.

    During the days of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the construction workers of the Tom-Usinsk Thermal Power Plant put forward the slogan of completing the Seven-Year Plan in six years. They aim to generate electricity from four units this year, striving to generate 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours annually; by next year, when another 200,000-kilowatt unit is put into production, the power generation will reach more than 3.7 billion kilowatt-hours; and the cost will be reduced from 6.5 kopecks per kilowatt-hour to 3.5 kopecks.

    In order to guarantee the power plant's coal supply, the Mizhdurechensk coal mine in the southern Kuzbass, in addition to innovating the existing coal mines, will also build a modern open-pit mine. The slogan put forward by the coal miners is to ensure that the Tom-Usinsk Thermal Power Plant obtains enough high-quality coal.

### 苏联托姆河畔兴建火电站

    苏联托姆河畔兴建火电站
    本报莫斯科13日电　座落在库兹巴斯南部托姆河畔的托姆辛斯克火电站建设工地是苏联大力发展火电站建设和开发东部地区的重点工程之一。
    这个发电能力初步计划为一百一十万瓩的火电站目前正以极快的速度建设着。
    几年前这里还是一片荒凉，而今天已经出现了一座座崭新的工业建筑物。来自苏联各地的两千多名工人，正日夜紧张地劳动在这块巨大的工地上。争取得到“共产主义劳动队”称号的竞赛进行得如火如荼，到目前为止已经有十一个工作队取得了这一光荣的称号。其中索科洛夫工作队劳动功绩尤其卓著，他们经常完成工作定额的两倍或三倍，每个工人都掌握了两种基本技术。
    在苏共中央六月全会开会的日子里，托姆辛斯克火电站的建设工人提出了七年计划六年完成的口号，他们要在今年内使四部机组发电，争取年内发电十七亿度；到明年，另一部功能为二十万瓩的机组投入生产后，发电量将达到三十七亿度以上；而成本将由每度电六点五戈比降到三点五戈比。
    为了保证电站用煤，库兹巴斯南部的米日都列琴斯克煤矿，除去旧有煤矿进行技术革新以外，还要建设一个现代化的露天矿。煤矿工人提出的口号是，要使托姆辛斯克火电站获得足够的高质煤炭。
