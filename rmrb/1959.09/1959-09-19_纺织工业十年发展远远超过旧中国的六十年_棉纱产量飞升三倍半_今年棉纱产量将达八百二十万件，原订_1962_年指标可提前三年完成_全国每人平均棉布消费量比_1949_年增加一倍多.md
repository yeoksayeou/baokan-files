Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch: Over the past decade, the development of China's textile industry has greatly surpassed the development level of the old China's sixty years. Its rapid development has continuously improved the clothing situation of the Chinese people.

In 1959, China's cotton yarn production will reach 8.2 million pieces, an increase of 3.56 times compared to 1949. Thus, the grand target set by China's Second Five-Year Plan to produce 8 to 9 million pieces of cotton yarn by 1962 can be victoriously completed three years ahead of schedule. In 1959, the per capita consumption of cotton cloth for China's 650 million population increased by more than double compared to 1949. The average per capita consumption of woolen fabrics and silk fabrics has also greatly increased. Compared to 1952, in 1958, wool yarn increased by 2.7 times, knitted goods increased by 1.5 times, and woolen and silk fabrics also increased by more than double. These tremendous achievements are the result of the high-speed development of the textile industry over the past decade, especially the brilliant achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959.

Ten years ago, the old China left behind a textile industry bearing the brand of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. It did not have a complete set of domestically manufactured machines; half of the raw cotton it used had to be imported from imperialist countries; it was abnormally concentrated in a few coastal cities, far away from the raw material producing areas and consumer markets; its development speed was as slow as a snail's pace. From the opening of the first modern textile factory in 1890 to the eve of liberation in 1949, it only built a total of 5 million cotton spindles in sixty years. The highest annual output of cotton yarn in sixty years was only 2.45 million pieces, and cotton cloth was only 2.79 billion meters. By 1949, the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth had further declined to 1.8 million pieces and 1.89 billion meters, respectively.

It was on such a weak foundation that China began to restore and develop the textile industry. After three years of restoration, by 1952, China's cotton yarn production not only quickly recovered to the highest annual production level in history, but also exceeded it by 48%. From 1953 to 1957, the textile industry continued to leap forward at an average annual growth rate of 9.2%. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, China's textile industry entered an unprecedented period of Great Leap Forward. In this year, cotton yarn production reached 6.1 million pieces, an increase of 31% compared to 1957, equivalent to six times the average annual growth rate of the First Five-Year Plan; cotton cloth was 5.7 billion meters, an increase of 13% compared to 1957, and woolen, linen, silk, and other textiles all increased by about 40% compared to 1957. In 1959, China's textile industry continued to leap forward at an even higher speed than in 1958. In the first half of this year, cotton yarn production increased by 46% compared to the same period last year, and cotton cloth increased by 31%. The unprecedented Great Leap Forward in these two years has enabled China's textile industry to win a great victory of completing the Five-Year Plan in two years.

Such a high development speed of China's textile industry is not only impossible in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, but even the capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States, which are known for their developed textile industries, cannot match it. The period from 1901 to 1913 was the fastest growing period for the British textile industry, but the total output value of the textile industry in 1912, the year with the highest development speed, only increased by 12% compared to 1911, while China's growth rate in 1956, which was not the fastest, increased by 21% compared to 1955. If we further compare the thriving prosperity of the new China's textile industry with the production decline, factory closures, and worker unemployment in the capitalist world in the past decade, it is an even more striking contrast. From 1949 to 1957, the total output value of China's textile industry (excluding handicrafts) increased by 2.13 times, with an average annual growth of 15.3%, while in these eight years, Britain only increased by 5% and the United States only increased by 4%, both less than China's average annual growth rate. In 1958, during China's Great Leap Forward, Britain's cotton yarn production decreased by 15% compared to 1957. In this year, Britain's cotton yarn production was only one-quarter of China's.

The high-speed development of China's textile industry over the past decade has been achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, implementing the policy of actively developing light industry while prioritizing the development of heavy industry, to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural life on the basis of developing production. The state first took a series of specific measures to vigorously develop the production of textile resources and establish its own textile machinery industry system, to change the semi-colonial state of the textile industry's dependence on imperialism for raw materials and equipment before liberation. Thanks to the efforts of the vast number of peasants, by 1951, China's cotton production had exceeded the highest production level in history. Compared to 1949, in 1957, cotton increased by 2.69 times, jute increased by 8.5 times, and both wool and silkworm cocoons increased by more than double. From 1950 to 1958, the textile machinery industry department produced a total of 3.8 million cotton spinning machines and more than 86,000 looms, equipping a large number of newly built textile factories. These equipments are far superior in quality and performance to the old equipments imported from capitalist countries in the past.

The self-sufficiency of textile raw materials and equipment provided a material basis for the large-scale construction of new factories. Therefore, starting in 1953, the state carried out large-scale basic construction of the textile industry in the raw material producing areas. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state's investment in basic construction for the textile industry reached about 1.6 billion yuan, and a total of more than 70 cotton, wool, linen, silk, printing and dyeing factories were constructed. The scale of basic construction in 1958 and 1959 was even larger, with 118 basic construction projects included in the national plan, and the basic construction scale of cotton textile factories alone reached more than 2 million spindles. These newly built textile factories are located in 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. The centers of cotton producing areas in the interior, such as Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Handan, and Shijiazhuang, have become emerging textile industrial bases, each with a huge amount of cotton textile equipment. Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and other fraternal ethnic regions also have modern textile factories. The construction of these textile factories has fundamentally changed the unreasonable layout of the textile industry in the past, bringing factories closer to raw material producing areas and consumer markets, and greatly promoting the prosperity and development of economic undertakings in the interior and fraternal ethnic regions.

    纺织工业十年发展远远超过旧中国的六十年
    棉纱产量飞升三倍半
    今年棉纱产量将达八百二十万件，原订1962年指标可提前三年完成
    全国每人平均棉布消费量比1949年增加一倍多
    据新华社18日讯　十年来，我国纺织工业的发展已大大超过了旧中国六十年的发展水平。它的飞跃发展，使我国人民的衣着状况不断获得改善。
    1959年我国棉纱产量将达到八百二十万件，比1949年增加三点五六倍，这样，我国第二个五年计划规定的到1962年生产棉纱八百到九百万件的宏伟指标，就可以提前三年胜利完成；1959年我国六亿五千万人口每人平均棉布消费量比1949年增加了一倍多。呢绒、绸缎平均每人的消费量也有很大增长。以1958年与1952年比较，毛线增加二点七倍，针织品增加一倍半，呢绒绸缎也都增长一倍以上。这些巨大成就是十年来高速度发展纺织工业的结果，特别是1958年大跃进和1959年继续大跃进的光辉战果。
    十年前，旧中国遗留下来的是一个满身带着半封建、半殖民地烙印的纺织工业。它没有一套完整的本国制造的机器；它所用的原棉有一半要从帝国主义国家进口；它远离了原料产地和消费市场而畸形地集中在少数沿海城市；它的发展速度像蜗牛一样地缓慢，从1890年开办第一个近代化纺织厂到1949年解放前夕的六十年间，一共只建设了五百万枚棉纺锭。六十年中棉纱最高年产量只有二百四十五万件，棉布只有二十七点九亿米，到1949年棉纱和棉布的产量更分别下降为一百八十万件和一十八点九亿米。
    就在这样一个薄弱的基础上，我国开始进行纺织工业的恢复和发展工作。经过三年的恢复，到1952年，我国棉纱产量不仅迅速恢复到历史上最高年产量水平，而且还超过48％。从1953年到1957年，纺织工业继续以每年平均增长9.2％的速度向前跃进。1958年在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国纺织工业更进入了一个史无前例的大跃进时期，这一年棉纱产量达到六百一十万件，比1957年增长31％，相当于第一个五年计划每年平均增长速度的六倍；棉布五十七亿米，比1957年增长13％，毛、麻、丝等纺织品都比1957年增长40％左右。1959年我国纺织工业又以比1958年更高的速度继续跃进。今年上半年，棉纱产量比去年同期增长46％，棉布增长31％。这两年的空前大跃进，使我国纺织工业赢得了两年完成五年计划的巨大胜利。
    我国纺织工业这样高的发展速度，不仅是半封建、半殖民地的旧中国不可能有，即使纺织工业素称发达的英、美等资本主义国家也望尘莫及，英国纺织工业在1901到1913年间，是发展最快的时期，但是发展速度最高的1912年纺织工业的总产值只比1911年增加了12％，而我国发展速度不算最快的1956年就比1955年增长了21％。如果再把新中国纺织工业蒸蒸日上的繁荣景象和资本主义世界近十年来的生产下降，工厂倒闭、工人失业的情况对比，更是一幅鲜明的对照。从1949年到1957年，我国纺织工业的总产值（不包括手工业）共增加了二点一三倍，每年平均增长15.3％，而在这八年中，英国一共只增长了5％，美国只增长了4％，都不及我国平均一年增长的速度。1958年在我国大跃进时期，英国的棉纱产量又比1957年下降了15％，这一年英国的棉纱产量只有我国的四分之一。
    十年来我国纺织工业的高速度发展，是在中国共产党的领导下贯彻执行了在优先发展重工业的同时，积极地发展轻工业的方针，以保证在发展生产的基础上，逐步提高人民物质文化生活。国家首先采取了一系列具体措施大力发展纺织资源的生产和建立自己的纺织机械工业体系，以改变解放前纺织工业在原料和设备上依赖帝国主义的半殖民地状态。由于广大农民的努力，到1951年我国棉花产量即已超过了历史上最高产量水平。以1957年与1949年比较，棉花增加二点六九倍，黄麻增加八点五倍，羊毛和蚕茧都增加一倍以上。纺织机械工业部门从1950年到1958年共生产了三百八十万锭棉纺机和八万六千多台布机，武装了大批新建的纺织工厂。这些设备在质量和性能上都远远超过了过去从资本主义国家进口的旧设备。
    纺织原料和设备的自给为大规模建设新厂提供了物质基础，因此从1953年开始，国家就在原料产地进行纺织工业的大规模基本建设。第一个五年计划期间国家对于纺织工业的基本建设投资达十六亿元左右，施工建设的棉、毛、麻、丝、印染厂共达七十多个。1958年和1959年基本建设规模更大，列入国家计划的基建项目就有一百一十八个，仅棉纺织厂的基建规模就达二百多万锭。这些新建的纺织厂遍布在全国二十七个省、市、自治区。内地产棉区的中心如西安、郑州、邯郸、石家庄都已成为新兴的纺织工业基地，每个基地都拥有数量巨大的棉纺织设备。新疆、青海、内蒙古、宁夏等兄弟民族地区也有了近代化的纺织厂。这些纺织厂的兴建，根本改变了过去纺织工业的不合理的布局，使工厂接近原料产地和消费市场，并且大大促进了内地和兄弟民族地区经济事业的繁荣和发展。（附图片）
