Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 20th: The "Red Flag" brand luxury car has been trial-produced in batches at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The first batch of thirty vehicles are being shipped to Beijing successively to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The batch trial production of the "Red Flag" brand luxury car marks that the technological level of China's automobile manufacturing industry has achieved a leap from producing trucks to manufacturing high-end cars, and from producing single varieties to manufacturing a variety of cars. This is also a new achievement made by China's automobile manufacturers in this year's continued great leap forward, adhering to the glorious banner of the general line, and climbing the peak of automobile industrial technology through large-scale mass movements.

According to the original plan of the factory, the First Automobile Factory was to trial-produce prototype luxury cars before the National Day this year; this plan was completed one year ahead of schedule when the first "Red Flag" car was trial-produced in August last year. The plan to trial-produce a batch of luxury cars starting in 1962 was also realized three years ahead of schedule.

In more than a year, from producing trucks to being able to produce cars, this is a speed that capitalist countries dare not imagine. In capitalist countries, a new model usually takes more than three years from design and planning to production; while China has completed this main journey in just one year.

The "Red Flag" brand luxury car is not only beautiful and elegant in appearance, but also adopts the new technology of modern luxury cars. It is equipped with a high-horsepower, high-speed "V" shaped eight-cylinder engine with a maximum power of 210 horsepower and a maximum speed of 160 kilometers per hour. In addition, it is equipped with many new-style equipment to ensure smooth operation, easy handling, safe driving and comfortable riding. After rigorous testing, it has been proven that this car fully meets the design requirements and has good performance.

The design, trial production, production preparation and batch trial production of the "Red Flag" brand luxury car were carried out by adopting the method of "three combinations" of leading personnel, technical personnel and workers, and were supported and cooperated by more than 70 brother factories. Therefore, the speed of trial production and various production preparation work has been greatly accelerated.

### “红旗”牌高级轿车开始成批试生产  三十辆正运往北京准备向国庆节献礼

    “红旗”牌高级轿车开始成批试生产
    三十辆正运往北京准备向国庆节献礼
    新华社长春20日电　“红旗”牌高级轿车已在第一汽车制造厂成批地试生产出来。首批的三十辆正在陆续运往北京，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。
    “红旗”牌高级轿车的成批试生产，标志着我国汽车制造业的技术水平，已经实现了由生产卡车到制造高级轿车、由生产单品种到制造多种汽车的飞跃。这也是我国的汽车制造者在今年的继续跃进中，坚持总路线的光辉旗帜，通过大搞群众运动，攀登汽车工业技术尖端所取得的新成就。
    按照工厂原定规划，第一汽车厂要在今年国庆节前才试制高级轿车的样车；这个规划，已在去年8月试制出第一辆“红旗”轿车时就提前一年完成了。原定在1962年开始试制一批高级轿车的规划，也提前三年实现了。
    在一年多的时间中，从生产卡车到能生产轿车，这是资本主义国家不敢设想的速度。在资本主义国家，一种新车型，从设计、计划到投入生产，一般都是三年多的时间；而我国只用一年就走完了这段主要路程。
      “红旗”牌高级轿车不仅外形美观大方，而且采用了现代高级轿车的新技术，装有大马力高速度“V”形八缸发动机，最大功率为二百一十马力，最大时速一百六十公里。此外，还装有保证行车时运转柔和、操纵轻便、行驶安全、乘坐舒适的许多新式设备。经过严格地试验，证明这种轿车完全符合设计要求，性能良好。
      “红旗”牌高级轿车的设计、试制、生产准备和成批试生产，是采取了领导人员、技术人员和工人“三结合”的办法进行的，并且得到七十多个兄弟厂的协作配合。因此，大大加快了试制和各项生产准备工作的速度。
