    This newspaper reports Guangdong Shaoguan City's Zhangshi People's Commune, building on the foundation of comprehensive production development last year, has continued to leverage the superiority of the people's commune – its large size and high degree of public ownership – in the first half of this year, achieving a new all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Early rice production increased by 40% compared to last year. After reasonably allocating rations, seeds, and feed, over six million catties of grain have been turned over to the state, equivalent to 90% of the annual target. Industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have all flourished.
    In diversified operations, the Zhangshi Commune has expanded the planting area for peanuts from 5,000 mu last year to 7,000 mu, and they are growing very well, promising a bumper harvest. Economic crops such as sugarcane and soybeans have also increased from over 5,000 mu to over 8,800 mu. In the mountainous areas such as Shangxia Yao, the commune has also developed sideline production of tea, dried mushrooms, and honey. In animal husbandry, there are more than 7,150 pigs, an increase of 48% compared to the same period last year, with an average of nearly two pigs raised per household. There are more than 119,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, more than double the number in the same period last year, with an average of more than ten per household. Fishery production has also greatly increased, with more than 3 million fish of various types currently being raised, more than double the number in the same period last year. Afforestation, timber production, and fruit trees have also seen great development. This spring, the commune averaged nearly two mu of afforestation per person, and the area of fruit trees averaged 0.5 mu per person. In addition, more than one million fruit tree seedlings have been cultivated in preparation for planting. In industry, the policy of serving agricultural production has been further implemented and, after adjustments, has developed more solidly. Based on needs and possibilities, the commune transferred some industries suitable for production brigade management, such as lime factories, iron and woodworking repair shops, and oil pressing factories, to brigade management. The commune concentrated manpower, materials, and financial resources to operate key industrial projects well, such as farm tool factories, timber logging and processing factories, brick and tile factories, power plants, etc. In the first half of this year, the total industrial output value of the commune reached 1,126,770 yuan, approximately equal to 93% of the total industrial output value for the entire previous year.
    With the development of various productions, the number of goods that the Zhangshi Commune provided to the market has greatly increased. In grain alone, this year's early harvest sold 2,140,000 catties more of commodity grain than in the same period last year. As of July, 468 pigs were transferred to the state, an increase of 223 pigs compared to the same period last year; 1,057 chickens, ducks, and geese were transferred. Due to the development of production, the lives of commune members have also improved. Currently, the total savings of commune members in the commune has reached 750,000 yuan, equivalent to 2.7 times the 280,000 yuan in savings at the end of last year, and more than 15 times the savings in 1957.
    The ability of Zhangshi Commune to continue to achieve more comprehensive development in various productions in the first half of this year is primarily due to leveraging the superiority of the commune – its large size and high degree of public ownership – and implementing the policy of taking grain as the main focus and comprehensively developing production. Zhangshi Commune is located in the mountainous area of Shaoguan City, with mountainous areas, plains, economic crop areas, and rice growing areas. Based on the characteristics of the commune being mountainous, rich in resources, and with ample land, and under the principle of obeying the state plan, the Commune Party Committee resolutely implemented the policy of taking grain as the main focus, developing a diversified economy, and combining self-sufficiency production with commodity production. The commune unified land planning, converting low-yield fields and sandy fields suitable for planting peanuts to peanut cultivation, expanding the area of oil crops by 2,000 mu. Under the principle of ensuring the completion of the rice production plan, it also expanded miscellaneous grain crops such as taro, sweet potatoes, and cassava by more than 3,000 mu. According to the needs of the market and urban and rural people, it also vigorously developed commodity production of vegetables, straw mushrooms, watermelons, dried mushrooms, tea, honey, bamboo, wood, etc. The commune also made reasonable arrangements for labor, with 70% of the labor force engaged in agricultural production, 20% in industry and diversified operations, and 10% as logistics personnel. The commune established various specialized management organizations, and professional teams were established on each production front. For example, the industrial front was divided into twelve projects: farm tools, ironware, power generation, coal plants, timber, bricks and tiles, lime, cement, and non-staple food processing, with another four professional teams for infrastructure construction, transportation, fishing, and hunting. On the agricultural front, in order to do a good job in diversified operations, the commune organized more than 390 laborers in the Shangxia Yao mountains to specialize in tea, dried mushrooms, honey, etc. In terms of sideline production, in addition to the commune organizing professional teams, the brigade adopted the method of large-scale efforts during slack seasons and smaller efforts or surprise attacks during busy seasons. In developing animal husbandry, the policy of walking on two legs – public raising and private raising – was adopted. The commune and major brigades maintained livestock farms, and small teams had more than 300 livestock groups. 30% of farmers raised pigs, and 100% of farmers raised chickens, ducks, and geese, leading to a rapid advance in animal husbandry throughout the commune.
    Secondly, improving leadership methods and resolutely implementing the mass line are the main guarantees for the continued leap forward in various tasks of the Zhangshi Commune. First, strengthen collective leadership and divide responsibilities. This year, the agricultural, industrial, animal husbandry, forestry, financial, and cultural and educational fronts of the commune generally have a Party Committee secretary specifically responsible, or at least a Party Committee member in charge. Each major brigade has a Party Committee secretary of the commune assigned to supervise and promote work in assigned areas. This plays a major role in strengthening the relationship between the Party Committee and the brigade, going deep among the masses, unifying thinking from top to bottom, and grasping the overall situation. Second, conscientiously implement the policy of "joint discussion, joint decision, joint implementation, and joint responsibility," which is a very good working method for implementing the mass line. The Party Committee of the commune, in addition to conducting collective discussions on many major issues in production and work, also conducts discussions with various branches and the masses before making decisions and jointly implementing them. The Party Committee of the commune also frequently holds symposiums and meetings with experienced farmers to study various measures to increase production. In this way, the masses have great enthusiasm and the effect of implementation is good. Third, implement the spirit of the General Line in various specific tasks, constantly encourage hard work, and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. Since the early harvest, the Party Committee of the commune has put forward clear requirements, goals, and measures in each period. These requirements and goals are advanced and can be achieved by the masses through hard work, skillful work, and practical work. In this way, the masses will go all out to complete them. However, the right-leaning conservative thinking of some people hindered their progress, they could not see the wisdom and creativity of the masses, and they were afraid to learn from the advanced. It is therefore necessary to establish examples, set up pacesetters, constantly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and fully mobilize and give play to the enthusiasm of all cadres and the masses.
    After the resolutions and communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were announced, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in Zhangshi Commune has doubled. A high tide of late rice field management has now been launched. The main activities currently underway are: a major effort to promote tillering of rice seedlings, with more than 300,000 seedlings per mu; vigorously eliminating low-yield fields and universally applying topdressing fertilizer; strengthening inter-tillage, with the second inter-tillage already completed and the third inter-tillage in progress.

    以粮为主发展多种经济　根据国家需要增产商品
    樟市人民公社生产满堂红
    早稻增产四成，生猪增长48％，渔业增加一倍，林业有大发展，半年工业总产值接近去年全年，社员存款增加近二倍
    本报讯　广东韶关市樟市人民公社在去年生产全面发展的基础上，今年上半年继续发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，工农业生产又获得了全面的新的跃进。早稻比去年增产四成，除合理安排口粮、种籽和饲料以外，已交公粮六百多万斤，等于全年任务的九成。工业及林、牧、副、渔等各项生产都是满堂红。
    樟市公社在多种经营方面，花生的种植面积从去年的五千亩扩大到七千亩，生长得很好，丰收在望；甘蔗、黄豆等经济作物也从五千多亩扩大到八千八百多亩；这个公社的上下瑶等山区，还发展了茶叶、冬菇、蜂蜜等副业生产。畜牧业生产方面，存栏生猪七千一百五十多头，比去年同期增长了48％，平均每户饲养将近两头；鸡、鸭、鹅达十一万九千多只，比去年同期翻了一番，平均每户有十多只；渔业生产也大有增加，目前饲养各种鱼三百多万尾，比去年同期增加一倍多。造林、木材生产、果树等也有很大发展，今春全社每人平均造林近二亩，果树面积每人平均已有五分，另外，还栽培了一百多万株果树苗，准备种植。工业方面，进一步贯彻了为农业生产服务的方针，经过调整，更扎实地发展了。公社根据需要和可能，把一部分适合生产大队经营管理的工业如石灰厂、铁木器修理厂、榨油厂等交由大队经营。公社集中人力、物力和财力，办好主要的工业项目，如农具厂、木材砍伐加工厂、砖瓦厂、电力厂等。今年上半年，公社工业总产值即达到一百一十二万六千七百七十多元，约等于去年全年工业总产值的93％。
    随着各项生产的发展，樟市公社为市场提供的商品大量增加了。仅粮食一项，今年早造就比去年同期多出售了二百一十四万斤商品粮。到7月份止，上调生猪四百六十八头，比去年同期增加了二百二十三头；上调鸡、鸭、鹅一千零五十七只。由于生产的发展，社员的生活也有所提高。现在全公社社员存款已达七十五万元，等于去年年底时存款二十八万元的二点七倍，比1957年时的存款增加了十五倍多。
    樟市公社今年上半年的各项生产能够继续获得更全面的发展，首先是发挥了公社一大二公的优越性，贯彻了以粮食为主、全面发展生产的方针。樟市公社位于韶关市郊的山区地带，有山区、有平原、有经济作物区，也有水稻种植区。公社党委根据全社山多、资源丰富、土地充足的特点，在服从国家计划的原则下，坚决执行以粮食为主、发展多种经济，自给性生产与商品性生产并举的方针。公社统一规划土地，把低产田、泥沙田等适合种花生的土地改种花生，扩大了油料作物二千亩；在保证完成水稻生产计划的原则下，又扩大芋头、茨薯、木薯等杂粮作物三千多亩。根据市场和城乡人民的需要，又大力发展蔬菜、草菇、西瓜、冬菇、茶叶、蜂蜜、竹木等商品性生产。公社又把劳动力作了合理安排，以70％的劳力搞农业生产，20％的劳力搞工业和多种经营，10％为后勤人员。公社成立各个专业专管机构，各条生产战线成立专业队伍。如工业战线共分农具、铁器、发电、煤厂、木材、砖瓦、石灰、水泥、副食品加工等十二个项目，另有基建、运输、捕鱼、猎业等四个专业队。在农业战线上，为了搞好多种经营，公社在上下瑶山组织了三百九十多个劳动力专职经营茶叶、冬菇、蜂蜜等。副业生产方面，除公社组织专业队伍外，大队采取农闲大搞、农忙少搞或突击的办法。在发展畜牧生产方面，采取公养和私养两条腿走路的方针，公社和各大队保持畜牧场，小队有三百多个畜牧小组，30％的农户养了猪，百分之百的农户养了鸡、鸭、鹅，全社畜牧业飞跃向前发展。
    其次，改进领导方法，坚决贯彻群众路线，是樟市公社各项工作继续跃进的主要保证。第一，加强集体领导，分工负责。今年公社的农业、工业、畜牧业、林业、财经、文教等战线，一般都有党委书记专门负责，至少有党委委员专管，各个大队都有公社党委书记分片包干督战，这对于密切党委与大队的关系，深入群众，上下思想统一，掌握全面情况等，都起了重大作用。第二，认真执行“共同讨论、共同决定、共同执行、共同负责”的方针，这是贯彻群众路线的一个很好的工作方法。公社党委对生产和工作上的许多重大问题，除进行集体讨论外，都经过各支部和群众讨论，然后才作出决定，共同贯彻。公社党委还经常召开座谈会和老农会，研究各种增产措施。这样，群众劲头大，执行的效果好。第三，把总路线的精神贯彻到各种具体工作中去，不断鼓足干劲，克服右倾保守思想。从早造以来，公社党委在每一时期，都提出明确的要求、目标和措施，这个要求和目标是先进的，是群众经过苦干、巧干和实干可以达到的，这样，群众就会鼓足最大干劲去完成。但是，有些人的右倾保守思想绊住了脚，看不到群众的智慧与创造，不敢向先进看齐。这就必须树立榜样，树立标兵，不断克服右倾保守思想，充分调动和发挥全体干部和群众的积极性。
    中共八届八中全会决议和公报公布后，樟市公社干部和群众干劲倍增，目前已掀起晚稻田间管理高潮。当前的主要活动是：大攻禾苗分蘖关，大施肥料，每亩现已达三十万株苗以上；大力消灭低产田，普遍追施壮尾肥；加强中耕，目前第二次中耕已结束，第三次中耕正在进行。
