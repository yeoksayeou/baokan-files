Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 7th: To celebrate the completion and commissioning of the Batak Hydropower Station's hydro-engineering complex, one of the largest construction projects in Bulgaria in the fifteen years since its founding, a mass rally was held on the dam of the hydropower station on September 6th.

Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Traikov, Chervenkov, and others attended the rally.

First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Zhivkov, spoke at the rally.

He said that the completion and commissioning of the Batak Hydropower Station's hydro-engineering complex is an event of great political and economic significance, which enables Bulgaria to take a major step forward in establishing a socialist material and technical foundation and in realizing the program proposed by the Bulgarian Communist Party to further electrify and industrialize Bulgaria.

Zhivkov pointed out that the completion of the Batak hydro-engineering complex coincides with the eve of the fifteenth anniversary (September 9th) of the victory of the Bulgarian people's uprising. In welcoming this most glorious national holiday of September 9th, the Bulgarian people are very confident in their own strength, have a firm will to complete the task of accelerating national economic development, and have unwavering confidence in the complete victory of socialism and communism.

Zhivkov said that on the eve of our greatest holiday, we express our love and gratitude to our liberator, savior, and great protector, the Soviet Union, which has provided fraternal assistance in our new life!

Zhivkov, on behalf of the Bulgarian people, thanked the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic for their assistance in the construction of the Batak hydro-engineering complex.

Zhivkov also spoke about international issues in his speech. He said that despite the opposition of the proponents of the "position of strength" policy, some signs of warming can still be seen in international relations, and the ice of the "Cold War" is beginning to melt. He emphasized that this is primarily the result of the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peaceful policy.

He said that we welcome the mutual visits of Soviet Premier Khrushchev and President Eisenhower. This is a victory for sound reason, a victory for the cause of peace, and a firm step towards improving the international atmosphere. The people of all countries hope that the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower will produce positive results, open the door for summit talks, for discussing and resolving outstanding issues and eliminating dangerous remnants of war, and create prospects for a historic turning point in the development of the current world political situation, enabling mankind to live in an environment of peaceful cooperation.

Zhivkov pointed out that the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, following a policy of peaceful coexistence and conducive to easing international tensions, once again extends its hand to the governments of other Balkan countries, expressing its sincere willingness to cooperate with them to transform the Balkans into a region of peace, into a nuclear weapon-free and rocket weapon-free zone, and advocating the peaceful settlement of all outstanding issues between these countries through negotiations, in accordance with the interests of the Balkan peoples.

The participants of the conference enthusiastically passed congratulatory telegrams to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bulgaria.

    保加利亚人民信心百倍加速建设
    重申愿同邻国共同努力变巴尔干为和平地区
    据新华社索非亚7日电　为了庆祝保加利亚建国十五年来的最大的建设项目之一——巴塔克水电站的水力枢纽工程的完工和投入生产，9月6日在这个水电站的水坝上举行了群众大会。
    保加利亚党政领导人日夫科夫、特莱科夫、契尔文科夫等出席了这个大会。
    保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在大会上讲话。
    他说，巴塔克水电站水力枢纽工程的建成和投入生产是一个有巨大政治和经济意义的事件，它使保加利亚在建立社会主义物质和技术基础、在实现保共提出的使保加利亚进一步电气化和工业化的纲领方面迈进了一大步。
    日夫科夫指出，巴塔克水力枢纽建成的时候，恰好是保加利亚人民起义胜利十五周年（9月9日）的前夕，保加利亚人民在迎接9月9日这一最光辉的民族节日时，十分坚信自己的力量，抱有完成加速国家经济发展任务的坚定意志，具有对社会主义和共产主义完全胜利的不可动摇的信心。
    日夫科夫说，在我们的最伟大的节日前夕，我们向我们的解放者、救星和伟大的保卫者、在新生活中兄弟般地援助我们的苏联表示我们的热爱和感谢！
    日夫科夫代表保加利亚人民感谢苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国在建设巴塔克水力枢纽中所给予的援助。
    日夫科夫在讲话中还谈到了国际问题。他说，尽管有“实力地位”政策的维护者的反对，在国际关系中仍可以看出某些转暖的现象，“冷战”的冰块正开始融化。他强调指出，这首先是苏联一贯执行和平政策的结果。
    他说，我们欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔总统的互相访问，这是健全的理智的胜利，是和平事业的胜利，是改善国际气氛的坚定的步骤。各国人民希望：赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的会见将产生积极的成果，将为最高级会谈、为讨论并解决悬而未决的问题和消除危险的战争残余打开大门，为当前世界政局发展中的历史性转折、为使人类能够生活在和平合作的环境中开辟前景。
    日夫科夫指出，保加利亚人民共和国政府遵循着和平共处和有利于缓和国际紧张局势的政策，再一次向其他巴尔干国家政府伸出手来，表示真诚地愿意同他们合作，把巴尔干变为和平地区，变成无核武器和火箭武器区，主张遵照巴尔干各国人民的利益，通过谈判和平解决这些国家之间一切悬而未决的问题。
    大会参加者热烈通过了给苏联共产党中央委员会和保加利亚共产党中央委员会的贺电。
