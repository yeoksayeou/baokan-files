Ode to the Ducao River

Little Ducao River, a mere thread of water; three days without rain bring drought, one heavy rain causes flooding. Since the "Watermelon Vine" was built, bold words are spoken: conquer nature! Fear no drought, fear no flood, water flows everywhere over the mountains and fields. No matter how fierce the heavens, no matter how treacherous the Dragon King; reach out and release the "Watermelon" water, even with a hundred days of severe drought, I will ensure a bumper harvest. – Ode to the Ducao River

The Ducao River Displays its Mighty Power

On the day the reporter arrived at the Guanghua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, he met Zhao Fulin, the County Party Secretary, who had just returned from working in the Zhao Gang Commune. While wiping the dust and sweat from his face, he briefly introduced the tremendous changes in the Ducao River. After speaking, he seemed to feel that these changes could not be explained clearly in a few words and suggested that I go and see for myself.

The Ducao River was not unfamiliar to me. In the winter of 1957, when the Xiangyang Special District launched a high tide of large-scale farmland water conservancy projects, I followed the water conservancy construction tour group organized by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to visit the Ducao River construction site. The working people of the Zhao Gang Commune (formerly a township) were among the creators of the "Watermelon Vine" style of self-flowing irrigation network. At that time, after the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed the "Five Transformations" of agriculture (with the conversion of dry land to paddy fields as a major part), in response to the Party's call to expand the area of paddy fields, they first built several simple small dams across the narrow riverbed of the Ducao River, and then opened several mountain channels that slowly climbed along the foot of the mountain and up the hillside. They also built more than a dozen reservoirs and small reservoirs using the natural terrain on both sides of the channels, and then extended their irrigation network, as numerous as cow hairs, to bring water into the farmland. The local people compared the dams to "watermelon roots," the channels to "watermelon vines," and the reservoirs and small reservoirs used to store water to "big watermelons," thus giving rise to the rather vivid name of the "Watermelon Vine" style of water conservancy network.

In reality, the Ducao River is nothing more than a small mountain gully tightly夹住 by two yellow earth ridges, only twenty-five kilometers long in total, with a total rainfall catchment area of only forty-two square kilometers, and a normal river flow of 0.06 cubic meters per second. According to some water conservancy technical experts, "One flow rate is at most enough to irrigate ten thousand mu of land." According to this statement, the small Ducao River could at most irrigate six hundred mu of land. However, the masses on both sides of the Ducao River stubbornly demanded water to irrigate thousands of mu and tens of thousands of mu of land. They created the "Watermelon Vine" style of water conservancy network, which can截住 the limited water source step by step and send it into ponds and reservoirs through winding mountain channels to accumulate it. By storing water year-round and using it to irrigate fields when needed, they accumulated a small amount to create a large amount, greatly expanding the area of benefit. However, when we first came to visit, people were still concentrating their efforts on large-scale water conservancy projects and had not had time to start large-scale land transformation. What we saw at that time, in addition to the new earth channels and dry ponds built on both sides of the Ducao River, was still bare barren mountain ridges and yellow dryland slopes, with hardly any paddy fields to be seen. At that time, some people with conservative ideas, upon hearing about the grand water conservancy construction and land transformation plan for the Ducao River, said that it was nothing more than "talking on paper, let's see how it turns out in the future." Some people were so stubborn that they even swore oaths to their faces, expressing their firm disbelief, saying, "How much ability can the small Ducao River have!?"

One evening, with a feeling of excited reunion, I came to the banks of the Ducao River again. I traveled along a rugged mountain road close to the river, at the foot of Dongshan in its lower reaches. The brilliant sunset glow reflected on the green mountain gully, and the terraced paddy fields spread across the fields. The dense and sturdy rice seedlings, connected high and low, were like a carpet woven from green velvet, spreading from the hillside all the way to the riverbank. As gusts of evening wind blew, the fields were filled with the rich fragrance of rice. The sound of flowing water could be heard everywhere in the ditches along the road and in the fields. With each step forward, my impression of the tremendous changes that had taken place along the riverbanks grew deeper and deeper. The Ducao River, which I thought I knew well, suddenly became completely unfamiliar to me; if I didn't have to stop and ask for directions from the nearby villagers from time to time, I would have suspected that I had taken the wrong road!

When I arrived at the office of the Zhao Gang Commune, the cadres had already eaten dinner and were holding a meeting to report on the drought resistance and field management situation in each management area and production team. According to them, the area of rice seedlings transplanted in the Ducao River irrigation area this year was more than 6,300 mu, which is 84 times larger than the total paddy field area in the entire Ducao River area before liberation (only 75 mu); it is also 14 times greater than the paddy field area in 1956 (before the large-scale development of the "Watermelon Vine" style water conservancy network) (420 mu). Although it has not rained for more than two months this year, the "Watermelon Vine" water conservancy network of the Ducao River still holds about 1.5 million cubic meters of water. Even if it doesn't rain again, the existing water volume is enough to guarantee the irrigation water for more than 6,000 mu of rice until the harvest, and it is all self-flowing irrigation without the need for waterwheels or manual carrying. Now, the "drought resistance" task in the Ducao River rice field area is mainly to educate the full-time "water managers" of the rice fields on how to further achieve rational irrigation, conserve water, and save more water to actively support the drought resistance struggle of dryland crops. Recently, they have been working hard to expand the area of irrigated land; at the same time, they have organized a large number of people to transport water by cart and carry water to water the seedlings in the sweet potato and corn fields on the hillside. Because the water source for the paddy fields is sufficient and the irrigation is self-flowing, the Zhao Gang Commune has greatly gained the initiative in the drought resistance struggle. In addition to fixing 600 water managers to specialize in paddy field water use, they have extracted nearly 8,000 laborers to invest in the drought resistance struggle of dryland crops; at the same time, they have extracted 1,200 people to plow the land and seize the time to plant late autumn crops.

The Great Commune Subdues Dragons and Tigers

The next day, the person in charge of the water conservancy project management office of the Zhao Gang Commune led me to visit the Black Tiger Mountain Reservoir, a medium-sized dam reservoir newly built on the Ducao River after the establishment of the commune. We walked out of Zhao Gang Street and went north along the Ducao River bank. Before long, we saw two mountains facing each other on the left and right banks of the upper reaches of the river, like two fierce tigers descending the mountain, probing their heads towards the Ducao Riverbed in the valley. The person in charge of the management office smiled and pointed to the two small mountain tops facing each other and said to me, "The mountain on the right is called White Tiger Mountain; the mountain on the left is called Black Tiger Mountain. They have arranged such a good natural terrain for us to build a dam reservoir!" A towering yellow earth dam appeared before our eyes. We saw it stretching out its giant arms, grabbing the head of the Black Tiger on the left and striking the brain of the White Tiger on the right. The dam body lay on the Ducao Riverbed like Mount Tai pressing down on the top. This large reservoir, which has not been completely completed but has been put into use ahead of schedule, is the heart of the "Watermelon Vine" style of self-flowing irrigation network in the Ducao River system and the source of infinite power; it is the child of the People's Commune!

In the winter of 1957, the Zhao Gang Township, which had realized agricultural cooperation, launched a high tide of large-scale farmland water conservancy construction. At that time, the scale of the society was small - there were only a dozen small societies on both sides of the Ducao River, each occupying a side. In order to adapt to the production and material conditions at that time, they built 30 simple dams on the Ducao River in separate small societies, opened 31 mountain channels with a total length of 114 kilometers, and built 77 large and small "Watermelon Ponds." In 1958, the plan was to convert 12,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, but from the time of transplanting seedlings, they encountered a drought. As a result, only more than 7,000 mu of seedlings were transplanted; after the seedling transplanting, the drought continued to develop. The sky did not rain, and the river water decreased day by day. The water stored in the "Watermelon Ponds" was completely used up. Unexpectedly, at the end of July, there was a rainstorm, and the Ducao River suddenly turned into an evil dragon. The torrential mountain flood rushed horizontally and vertically, submerging and destroying more than 700 mu of fertile land. After one drought and one flood, in the end, only more than 4,400 mu of the more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields were harvested. After the autumn harvest, the members of the Zhao Gang Commune seriously summarized the experience and lessons of the "Watermelon Vine" style of water conservancy network, and determined to fight nature to the end, so that the Ducao River would not be afraid of drought or flood, and would always ensure a bumper harvest. As a result of mass discussions, it was proposed to build another large dam reservoir in the middle reaches of the river - if a rainstorm came, it could open its big belly to swallow the flood in one gulp; after the rain, it would open its mouth again to spit out the water, so as to achieve "a small stream of water flowing continuously, without worrying about drought or flood."

Last winter, the hardworking and brave construction army of the Zhao Gang Commune, after they successfully completed the glorious task of vigorously developing iron and steel, then returned to the Ducao River, camped at Black Tiger Mountain, and mustered even greater enthusiasm. braving the wind, snow, and severe cold, wielding mountain-splitting hoes and stone-chiseling steel drills, determined to cut off the Ducao River and build a dam between Black Tiger and White Tiger. Construction started last winter, and 2,000 migrant workers fought hard through the winter and spring, braving the severe cold and snow, and basically completed the work in March of this year. Climbing to the top of the dam, we saw a man-made lake surrounded by green mountains before our eyes. The clear lake water rippled in the wind. At present, only the water-facing inner bank of the dam body has been repaired, and only half of the outer bank dike has been repaired to half its height; the two long mountain trunk channels specially designed for the new reservoir have not yet been started. Now, the reservoir still uses the old channels built in 1957 when building the "Watermelon Vine" for water release, which have been slightly expanded. For these reasons, this reservoir cannot fully exert its power this year. According to the original engineering design, it can store nearly 10 million cubic meters of water, but this year it actually only stored less than half of the water; according to the design, it can self-flow irrigate 30,000 mu of paddy fields, but this year it only irrigated more than 6,000 mu of fields, and the potential is still great.

Water Managers Have Clever Tricks for Managing Water

In the drought resistance struggle, the Ducao River's spider-web-like water conservancy facilities have indeed exerted tremendous power; however, water conservancy facilities are ultimately dead things, and the most important thing is to see how people use them.

This spring, there was more rain, and the newly built Black Tiger Mountain Reservoir and the "Watermelon Vine" system on both sides of the Ducao River were filled with water everywhere, which was originally a good thing. Unexpectedly, precisely because there was more water, some cadres and water managers developed a sense of complacency and complacency. They believed that since the water supply was sufficient, there was no need to emphasize "rational irrigation and water conservation." The Liuhe Production Team opened the sluice gates of the reservoir, and the water flowed for a long time day and night. This team only transplanted 400 mu of fields at the beginning, and used 320,000 cubic meters of water, with an average water consumption of up to 800 cubic meters per mu of field transplanted, far exceeding the annual water consumption of one mu of paddy field. This matter quickly attracted the attention of the commune Party committee, which immediately launched a mass self-education movement of "rational irrigation and water conservation" throughout the commune, quickly established and improved water conservancy management organizations, and established a professional team of water managers among the members.

During the two days I stayed at the Ducao River, I got to know several excellent and capable water managers. Chen Wengui, known as "good at observing yin and yang, able to know the seasons," is an old and experienced water manager of the Yonggu Production Team. For paddy field irrigation, according to the different weather conditions of sunshine, cold, wind force and direction, different crop growth periods and soil quality, etc., he can also change the timing, early, late, more, less in mastering water use, each with its own differences. For example, when the weather is cloudy and the air humidity is high, it is enough to irrigate the fields with only two tenths of water; when the weather is sunny, the evaporation of water increases, and the fields must be irrigated with four tenths of water; if it is both sunny and the south wind is blowing, and the climate is drier, then another one or two tenths of water must be added.... The captain of this team, Wang Dezhong, said: With the same amount of water and the same soil quality, other water managers can only irrigate 44 mu of fields, while Chen Wengui can irrigate 96 mu of fields, more than twice as much. The water manager of the Liuhe Team, Zhang Chuansheng, is assigned to manage 83 mu of paddy fields, large and small, with more than 400 plots. He can ensure that each plot is neither flooded nor dry day and night, and that the depth of irrigation is accurate. In order to save water resources, he took advantage of his spare time to build a total length of more than 1,200 meters of gully and dam in all the ditches, ridges, and depressions within his jurisdiction, and was able to intercept all the seepage water from the high paddy fields and the runoff water from the ground after rain without losing a drop. He used it to irrigate the paddy fields at lower elevations, saving the consumption of water from the main canal. He used these "waste water" to expand the beneficiary area by more than 20 mu of fields.

The Party Committee of the Zhao Gang Commune promptly summarized and promoted their water management experience in order to give full play to the drought resistance role of all water conservancy facilities. The daily water consumption of the more than 6,000 mu of paddy fields in the Ducao River system alone has been reduced from an average of about 20,000 cubic meters to 15,000 cubic meters. The entire commune has added many small river and runoff interception projects to intercept the seepage water in the riverbeds and fields, and used this water to expand the irrigation area by more than 870 mu.

The Future of the Ducao River

Now, the mid-season rice on both sides of the Ducao River has begun to be harvested. The drought-resistant crops, such as sweet potatoes and corn, which have been irrigated, are turning green from yellow day by day and growing vigorously. Many old people are moved to tears by comparing the past with the present. Wang Dezhong, an old man and captain of the Yonggu Team, said: "When I was young, I also encountered a major drought one year. At that time, apart from the landlords taking advantage of the fire to rob, coming to the door to urge rent and force debt, who else would build water conservancy and resist drought? Poor people fled to other places, begging for a living, and many people became ghosts in other places. Although this year's drought is more serious than that year, today, under the leadership of the Party, after several years of large-scale water conservancy construction, and actively leading the masses to resist drought, today, there is a scene of bumper harvest everywhere on both sides of the Ducao River - if I had not lived to this day to witness it with my own eyes, it would be difficult to believe that a major drought and a bumper harvest has become a true fact!"

However, the people of the Ducao River are not completely satisfied with the current situation. They often enthusiastically discuss the even better future of the Ducao River during their spare time after meals. They plan to make the Black Tiger Mountain Dam even stronger and taller this winter; they also want to make full use of all the mountain gullies, building reservoirs in the large gullies and ponds in the small gullies, so that the river water and the large and small reservoirs, channels, and ponds are all connected together, forever getting rid of the passive situation of "relying on the sky for food." They even described the magnificent fighting goals of the people of the entire commune in the language of poetry: "Fish scales cover the mountains (dig fish scale pits all over the mountains, plant trees, green the barren mountains, and maintain water and soil), long channels winding around the mountain peaks, water networks like spider webs, water flowing everywhere on the mountains, heavy rain does not go down the mountain (there are runoff interception reservoirs, ponds, and mountain channels that can intercept rainwater), floods do not leave the river (the Black Tiger Mountain Reservoir is enough to block floods), transform 30,000 mu of fields, and yield over 3,000 (jin) per mu. Trees fill the mountains, fruits are endless; townships are like cities, villages are like gardens; build hydropower stations, and have light and happiness for tens of thousands of years."

    杜槽河赞歌
    小小杜槽河，水流一条线；三日无雨闹干旱，一场大雨水泛滥。自从修起“西瓜秧”，口出豪语：战胜天！不怕旱，不怕淹，漫山遍野水潺潺。凭你老天狠，凭你老龙奸；伸手开放“西瓜”水，纵有百日大旱，我定保住丰年。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——杜槽河赞歌
    杜槽河大显神威
    记者到达中共光化县委会的当天，就遇见了刚从赵岗公社工作归来的县委书记赵富林。他一边抹去满脸的风尘和汗水，一边简单介绍了杜槽河巨大的变化。说完，他似乎认为这个变化并非三言五语能够谈清楚，再次地建议我亲自去看看。
    杜槽河在我的印象中并不是陌生的。1957年的冬天，襄阳专区掀起了大修农田水利运动高潮的时候，我曾跟随中共湖北省委组织的水利建设参观团，到杜槽河工地的现场参观过。赵岗公社（原为乡）的劳动人民，是“西瓜秧”式水利自流灌溉网的创始者之一。那时候，他们在中共湖北省委提出农业“五改”（旱地改水田是其中主要部分）以后，为响应党的号召扩大水田面积，首先在杜槽河狭窄的河床上，扎了几道简易的拦河小坝，又从坝根上开辟了几条沿着山脚往山坡上慢慢爬行的盘山渠，再在渠道两侧利用自然地形修起了十几个蓄水塘堰和小水库，然后伸展开它的多如牛毛的灌溉网，使水灌进农田。当地群众把拦河坝比做“西瓜根”，渠道比做“西瓜秧”（藤），而用以蓄水的塘堰、水库好比是个“大西瓜”，因此产生了“西瓜秧”式水利网这个颇为形象化的名称。
    杜槽河，其实不过是两条黄土岭紧紧夹住的一条小山沟，全长只有二十五公里，全部的存雨面积只有四十二平方公里，通常的河水流量是零点零六秒立方米。据有些水利技术专家说：“一个流量充其量不过灌一万亩田。”如果按这个说法，小小的杜槽河顶多不过灌六百亩田罢了。可是，杜槽河两岸的群众却硬向它要灌几千亩几万亩田的水。他们创造出“西瓜秧”式水利网，能把有限的水源节节截住，通过蜿蜒的盘山渠送进塘堰和水库里积蓄起来，常年蓄水，用时灌田，积少成多，大大地扩充了受益面积。不过，当我们初次来参观时，人们还正在集中力量大修水利工程，没有来得及着手大规模的改田，当时看到的，除了杜槽河两岸新修的一条条土渠、干塘以外，眼前仍然是光秃秃的荒山岭，黄堑堑的旱作坡地，很难看见几块水田。那时候有些思想保守的人，听说杜槽河如此宏伟的水利建设与改田规划，有的说这不过是“纸上谈兵，且看将来如何”；有的人顽固到竟至当面赌咒发誓，表示坚决不相信，他们说：“小小的杜槽河，能有多大的本领！？”
    一天傍晚，我怀着久别重逢的激动心情，又来到了杜槽河畔。沿着它的下游东山脚下，紧靠河边的一条崎岖山路前进。灿烂的晚霞映着绿色的山冲，遍野开辟成梯田形的稻田，高低相接的丛密茁壮的禾苗，好似一幅绿色的天鹅绒织成的地毯，从山坡一直铺到河岸上。阵阵晚风吹来，田野里飘着浓郁的稻谷芳香。路旁和田边的沟渠里，到处流水潺潺作响，每前进一步，对于河沿两岸发生的巨大的变化，印象越来越深。在我印象中曾经是熟悉的杜槽河，忽然又在我的眼前变成完全陌生的了；如果不是有时候得停下脚步向附近的老乡们问路，简直会怀疑自己是不是走错了路哩！
    来到赵岗公社的办公室，干部们已经吃过晚饭，正在开会汇报各管理区、生产队的抗旱和田间管理情况。听他们说，今年杜槽河灌溉区内，水稻插秧面积是六千三百多亩，比解放前全杜槽河区（只有七十五亩）水田扩大了八十四倍；比1956年（大搞“西瓜秧”式水利网前）的水田面积（四百二十亩）也增加了十四倍。尽管今年两个多月来没有下雨了，但是杜槽河的“西瓜秧”水利网里，还蓄存着约有一百五十万立方米的水量。即使再不下雨，现存水量也足可保证六千多亩稻谷到收割前的灌溉用水，而且不用水车，不用人挑，全部是自流灌溉。现在，在杜槽河稻田区的“抗旱”任务，主要是教育稻田的专职“管水员”们，如何进一步地做到合理灌溉，节约用水，节余出更多的水积极支援旱地作物的抗旱斗争。近来，他们正在努力扩大水浇地的面积；同时组织大批人力车水、挑水，在山坡上的红薯和苞谷地浇水救苗。由于稻田的水源足、而且自流灌溉，就使赵岗公社在抗旱斗争中大大争取了主动。他们除了固定六百个管水员专管稻田用水外，抽出近八千名劳动力投入了旱地作物抗旱斗争；同时抽出一千二百人犁地抢种晚秋作物。
    大公社降龙伏虎
    第二天，赵岗公社水利工程管理处的负责人领我参观了公社成立后在杜槽河上新修起的一座中型拦河水库——黑虎山水库。我们走出赵岗街，沿杜槽河岸北行，不远就望见了河上游的左右两岸有二山对峙，犹似两只猛虎下山之势，探头伸向山谷中的杜槽河床。管理处负责人笑指两座对峙的小山头对我说：“右边的山，名叫白虎山；左边的山，名叫黑虎山。它们给我们安排了一个多么好的修建拦河水库的天然地形啊！”在我们眼前出现一座巍峨矗立的黄土大坝，只见它伸展巨臂，左攫黑虎头，右击白虎脑，坝身像泰山压顶一样躺在那杜槽河的河床上。这个尚未完全竣工，提前交付使用的大水库，是杜槽河系“西瓜秧”式水利自流灌溉网的心脏，是无穷威力的源泉；它是人民公社的产儿！
    1957年冬季，实现了农业合作化的赵岗乡，掀起了大兴农田水利建设的高潮。当时，社的规模较小——仅杜槽河的两岸就有十几个小社，各据一方。他们为了适应当时的生产和物质条件，分别以小社为单位，在杜槽河上修起了三十条简易拦河坝，开了三十一条总长达一百一十四公里的盘山渠，结了七十七个大小“西瓜塘”。1958年计划由旱地改水田一万二千亩，可是从插秧时起就遇到了天旱，结果只插了七千多亩秧；插秧以后旱情继续发展，老天不下雨，河水逐日减少，“西瓜塘”里蓄的水全部用光了。不料7月底又来一场暴雨，杜槽河霎时间变成了一条恶龙，湍急咆哮的山洪横冲直闯，又淹没冲毁了七百多亩良田。经过一旱一淹，最后七千多亩稻田，只保收了四千四百多亩。秋收过后，赵岗公社社员们认真旱地总结了“西瓜秧”式水利网的经验教训，决心要与老天斗争到底，要使杜槽河既不怕旱又不怕淹，永远保住丰收年。经群众讨论的结果，提出要在河中游再修一座拦河大水库——如果暴雨来了，它能撑开大肚皮把洪水一口吞下；雨过天晴了，它再张开口把水吐出来，做到“细水长流、水旱无忧”。
    去年冬天，赵岗公社勤劳勇敢的建设大军，当他们胜利地完成了大办钢铁的光荣任务之后，接着回师杜槽河，结营黑虎山，鼓起更大的干劲，冒着风雪严寒，挥舞着劈山的镐头，凿石的钢钎，决心腰斩杜槽河，在黑虎、白虎之间修建拦河大坝。由去年冬季开工，两千民工冒着严寒风雪苦战一冬春，到今年3月基本完工了。攀登到大坝顶上，我们眼前现出青山环绕的人工湖泊，碧澄的湖水，迎风兴起漪涟微波。现在，水库坝身只修好了临水的内岸，外岸的半边堤只修到一半的高度；专为新水库设计的两条盘山长干渠尚未动工，如今水库放水仍然利用1957年修“西瓜秧”时的老渠，稍为扩修了一下。由于这些原因，这个水库今年还不可能充分发挥它的威力。按原工程设计可以蓄水近千万立方米，今年实际只蓄了不到一半的水；按设计可以自流灌溉三万亩稻田，今年还只灌溉了六千多亩田，潜力还大着哩。
    管水员管水有妙诀
    在抗旱斗争中，杜槽河密如蛛网的水利设施固然发挥出巨大的威力；可是，水利设施究竟是死的东西，最重要的还得看人们怎样来运用它。
    今年春天，雨水比较多，新修的黑虎山水库和杜槽河两岸的“西瓜秧”系统，到处都蓄满了水，这本来是一件好事。不料，正因为水多了，却使一部分干部和管水员滋长起麻痹自满情绪，他们认为既然水头充足，就不需要再来强调“合理灌溉、节约用水”啦。六合生产队把水库的闸门敞开，不分日夜，水哗哗地长淌漫流起来。这个队开始只插了四百亩田的秧，就用去了三十二万立方米的水，平均每亩田插秧耗用水量竟高达八百立方米，远远超过了一亩水田全年的用水量。这件事情很快引起了公社党委的注意，马上在全社展开了“合理灌溉，节约用水”的群众性自我教育运动，迅速建立和健全了水利管理机构，在社员中设立了管水的专业班子。
    在杜槽河逗留的两天里，我结识了几个优秀精干的管水员。被称为“善观阴阳，能知天时”的陈文贵，是永固生产队老有经验的管水员。他对于稻田灌溉，按照着天气阴晴冷暖、风力风向不同、作物生长期和田地土质不一等等特点，在掌握用水上迟、早、多、少也能随之千变万化，各有不同。比如天阴时空气湿度大，田里只灌二分水就够用了；而天晴时水的蒸发量加大，田里就得灌四分水；如果既是晴天，又刮起南风，气候更干燥，就得再加一、两分水……。这个队的队长王德中说：同样多的水，又是同样的土质，别人做管水员只能灌到四十四亩田，而陈文贵来管水却能灌到九十六亩田，相差一倍还多。六合队的管水员张传生，分工由他个人管着八十三亩、大小四百多块稻田，他能够保证日夜块块田不漫不干，灌水该深该浅分毫不差。为了节约水源，他在管区以内所有的沟垱洼冲，披星戴月，利用业余时间修起了一条总长达一千二百多米的拦冲沟、坝，能够把高处稻田里的渗漏水和下雨后地面的径流水，一滴不丢地全部拦蓄起来，用来灌溉低处的稻田，节省正渠的水的消耗量。他利用这些“废水”，扩大了二十多亩田受益面积。
    赵岗公社党委会为了充分发挥一切水利设施的抗旱作用，及时总结推广了他们的管水经验。仅杜槽河系的六千多亩水田，每天的耗水量由原来平均两万立方米左右，降低到一万五千立方米。全社加修了许多小型拦河、拦冲工程，用来拦蓄河床和田里的渗漏水，用这些水又扩大了八百七十多亩的灌溉面积。
    杜槽河的明天
    现在，杜槽河两岸的中稻已经开镰收割了。经过了抗旱浇水的旱庄稼——红薯、苞谷等，一天天由黄转青，生长茁壮。许多老人们从今昔对比感动得流下眼泪。永固队的队长王德中老汉说：“我幼年时，也曾遇到过一年大旱，那时候除了地主趁火打劫，登门催租逼债以外，还有谁修水利、抗旱呢？穷人逃奔异乡，讨乞维生，许多人作了异乡之鬼。今年的干旱虽比那一年还要严重，可是今天在党的领导下，经过几年来的大修水利，又积极领导群众抗旱，如今杜槽河两岸到处一片丰收景象——若不是我活到今天亲历目睹，实在难以相信大旱大丰收竟成了千真万确的事实哩！”
    但是，杜槽河的人们并不完全满足今天的现状，他们常常在业余饭后兴致勃勃地谈论着杜槽河更加美好的未来。他们计划在今年冬天，再把黑虎山大坝修得更加坚固、更加高大；还要把所有的山冲全部利用起来，大冲修水库，小冲修堰塘，使河水和大小水库、渠道、堰塘全部联贯起来，永远摆脱“靠天吃饭”的被动局面。他们更用诗歌的语言描述了全社人民宏伟的奋斗目标：“鱼鳞布满山（在山上遍挖鱼鳞坑，植上树，绿化荒山，保持水土），长渠盘山巅，水网如蛛网，遍山水潺潺，大雨不下山（有拦冲库、堰和盘山渠能把雨水拦住），洪水不出川（黑虎山大水库足可拦住洪水），改田三万亩，亩产超三千（斤）。遍山树成林，水果吃不完；乡镇如城市，村庄似花园；建设水电站，光明幸福万万年。”
