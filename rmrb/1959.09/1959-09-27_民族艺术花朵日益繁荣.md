National Art Flowers are Flourishing
Xiao Ying Zhang Man

    China's more than fifty ethnic groups all have their own excellent literary and artistic traditions; they are good at singing and dancing and have created extremely rich artistic assets. In the past, during arduous and dark years, this literature and art, which was full of strong popular character, became an indispensable and sharp weapon in the lives and struggles of the broad masses of working people. They deeply loved it and preserved it in various ways for widespread circulation. However, for thousands of years, especially in the last hundred years, the people of ethnic minorities have been subjected to heavy oppression by imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and slave owners. Not only did they not have equal rights in politics and economics, but the literature and art of various ethnic groups were also discriminated against, excluded, and even strangled. In order to strengthen their spiritual rule over ethnic minorities, the reactionary ruling classes and other reactionary forces of the past not only promoted feudal morality and spread national inferiority among them, but also formulated many prohibitions and decrees, and even used force to deal with the literary and artistic activities of the people of various ethnic groups. Under all these oppressions, the literature and art of ethnic minorities suffered extremely cruel destruction and devastation. By the eve of liberation, there were very few professional art troupes and professional literary and artistic workers from ethnic minorities; many valuable artistic heritages were incomplete, and some had long been lost; and the literary and artistic forms that were still circulating were relatively monotonous.

    The birth of the People's Republic of China has forever ended the evil history of national oppression, national discrimination, and national assimilation, and has begun a new era of national equality, national unity, and national prosperity. Over the past ten years, with the rapid development of political, economic, and cultural construction and the continuous improvement of the people's material life and cultural level, the literary and artistic undertakings of various ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly developed and prospered under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, and have achieved brilliant results.

    The Vigorous Development of Mass Art

    Since liberation, mass art activities in ethnic minority areas, under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and the principles of amateur volunteerism, small scale, and diversity, have been vigorously carried out around the central tasks of production struggles and various periods. Many people's communes have their own amateur art organizations for drama, music, dance, fine arts, etc., and tens of thousands of art activists and art backbones have emerged. The artistic talents of the working people of all ethnic groups have been fully expressed and brought into play. On the basis of inheriting the excellent traditions of their own ethnic groups, they have used and developed various folk art forms, such as the "pastoral songs" of the Mongolian people, the "collective dance" of the Korean people, the "nangma" of the Tibetan people, the "solo dance" of the Uyghur people, the "big song" of the Dong people, the "flying song" and "lusheng" of the Miao people... as well as various storytelling forms and arts and crafts, etc., all of which have become more splendid than in the past under the creative wisdom of the working people. Ethnic opera genres such as Zhuang opera, Dong opera, Tibetan opera, Dai opera, Tu opera, and Bai opera Chuichuiqiang, which were banned and destroyed and could not be developed during the Kuomintang rule, have been successively restored and developed after liberation; through the joint efforts with professional literary and artistic workers, a large number of excellent repertoires have been excavated and sorted out (some of which have established professional troupes). These repertoires (such as the Tibetan opera "Langsayuede Dongba", the Dong opera "Zhulang and Niangmei", and the Zhuang opera "Red Bronze Drum") are all valuable artistic assets that reflect the lives and struggles of ethnic minority people.

    Because the relations of production, modes of production, and content of life have undergone fundamental changes, customs and habits, and appreciation habits are also gradually changing. The artistic forms and content of various ethnic groups have also undergone corresponding new developments. Some activity forms with feudal and superstitious colors have become healthy artistic weapons that are beneficial to socialism after certain reforms and transformations. For example, the famous "Raoshanlin" in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, was originally a song and dance form used to pray to the Benzhuzhongdi 本主 (local deities), but now it has developed into a mass cultural activity that praises the new life and the Great Leap Forward. What is even more gratifying is that the people of the Yi, Miao, and Tujia ethnic groups have created their own new opera genres and repertoires such as "Yi Opera", "Miao Language Opera", and "Tu Language Opera" on the basis of folk songs. People of all ethnic groups have felt happiness in their actual lives, and they sincerely sing praises of the Party's leaders, the Party's leadership, the harvest, labor heroes, the great unity of fraternal ethnic groups, and the entire new life and new era. They are jubilant and full of confidence, and the low-pitched tunes under heavy oppression can no longer be heard. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the inspiration of the general line, ethnic minority areas, like all parts of the country, have seen a new situation of poems and paintings all over the walls, songs all over the fields, a hundred flowers blooming, and unprecedented artistic creation. The Rapid Growth of Professional Art Teams

    On the basis of such a large-scale and vigorous development of mass art, various literary and art institutions and professional art troupes that serve the working people and assist the development of mass art have been rapidly increased. Each autonomous region and more than 80% of the autonomous prefectures, and even many autonomous counties, have their own professional song and dance troupes, drama troupes, or cultural and work troupes. Compared with before liberation, the number has increased more than twenty times. Over the years, the Party and the government have taken various measures to train a large number of literary and art cadres for various ethnic minorities. In addition to the art departments of the Central University for Nationalities, which are specifically designed to train ethnic cadres, and the higher and secondary art colleges (schools) established in various autonomous regions, ethnic minority students also account for a certain proportion in more than 20 higher art colleges (schools) across the country. Together with various art professional training classes and study classes that have been opened over the years, the team of ethnic literary and art workers has rapidly grown and expanded to tens of thousands of people. At present, in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region alone, there are 52 professional cultural and work troupes and drama troupes, with more than 3,000 writers, artists, and professional literary and art workers.

    This is a powerful cultural and artistic army. This team has undergone ideological transformation in participating in a series of social reforms and political movements. In particular, through the struggles of rectification, anti-rightist, anti-Han chauvinism, and local nationalism, as well as participation in physical labor, they have received profound education. Therefore, they have been significantly improved politically and ideologically. Han cadres and fraternal ethnic minority cadres are more closely united. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, they have consistently followed the Party's literary and artistic policy, widely and deeply contacted the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and went to rural areas, pastoral areas, factories, mines, and troops to create and perform many excellent literary and artistic works; they have closely coordinated with the political movements and production struggles of various periods; they have powerfully educated and inspired the people's will to fight and the enthusiasm for building socialism; and they have assisted and promoted mass amateur literary and artistic activities. For example, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe often climb mountains, travel long distances, and go deep into mountainous areas and grasslands to perform for the masses and provide guidance. Similar activities have become the glorious and regular task of professional art troupes in ethnic minority areas. Talents Emerge in Large Numbers, and the Quality of Art is Greatly Improved

    Due to the implementation of the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," works of different styles and different themes and diverse artistic forms have been fully displayed and brought into play; more and more outstanding artistic talents have emerged. Such as the outstanding storytelling artists Mao Yihan and Pa Jie, the matouqin artist Sela Xi (Mongolian); the singers Bao Yin De Li Ge Er (Mongolian), Fang Chushan (Korean), Ayi Mu Ni Sha Ba Xia (Uyghur), Apao (Miao), Bai Xiuzhen (Yi), Cai Dan (Tibetan), etc.; the dancers Amina and Min Na Wa (Uyghur), Oumijia Can (Tibetan), etc.; the composers Zheng Zhenyu (Korean), Jin Guofu (Yi), etc.; as well as many other outstanding artists. Their outstanding artistic performances and artistic creations have been warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses of people at home and abroad. Literary and artistic workers and folk artists of various ethnic groups closely cooperate, and on the basis of inheriting traditions, they have sorted out and processed a large number of excellent art programs. For example: the Korean "Fan Dance", the Dai "Peacock Dance", the Uygur "Melon Planting Dance", the Tibetan "Reba on the Grassland", the Mongolian "Ordos" and "Milking Dance", as well as the Sani "Distant Guests, Please Stay", the Korean "Song of the Maidens" and other songs... These programs are not only loved and widely circulated by the people of all ethnic groups in China, but they are also excellent programs that have won awards in competitions at all previous World Youth Festivals. They fully demonstrate the richness and diversity of Chinese ethnic minority art, and excellent artistic talents, leaving a deep impression on the people of the world.

    Over the past ten years, through regional and national art festivals and touring performances, people of all ethnic groups have conducted extensive cultural and artistic exchanges. Everyone learns from each other and absorbs each other, adding new brilliance to the art of various ethnic groups. Many song and dance programs of ethnic minorities have been widely absorbed and frequently performed by professional or amateur art troupes in Han areas. And some artistic forms and repertoires of the Han nationality and even foreign countries (such as dramas, song and dance dramas, dance dramas, and various local operas; chorus, ensemble, oil painting, Chinese painting, etc.) have also been absorbed and introduced by professional and amateur art troupes in various ethnic regions, and they are fully used to express the thoughts and feelings of the people of their own ethnic groups. This mutual influence and mutual absorption have enabled the art of all ethnic groups to be further enriched and developed on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions and unique styles of their own ethnic groups.

    Significant Achievements in Excavation and Sorting

    Since the founding of the country, the Party and the government have taken various active measures, mobilized the broad masses of literary and artistic workers and the people, and conducted excavation, collection, and sorting work on the art circulating among various ethnic groups. Hundreds of thousands of classical literature, oral literature, folk songs, music, folk dances, and folk arts and crafts have been collected, and many have been sorted out and published or are being published one after another. What is particularly worth mentioning here is that many precious heritages with a long history circulating among the people (such as the classical music "Twelve Muqam" of the Uygur people in Xinjiang, the Yuan Dynasty instrumental music "Bessheri" including ten movements of the Naxi people, and the "Big Song" of the Dong people, etc.) are also under the care and leadership of the central and local Party committees, and they have been initially excavated or are continuing to be excavated. Folk artists of all ethnic groups have received great care and attention from the Party and the government since liberation, and their lives have been properly arranged and taken care of. They have contributed greatly to the work of discovering, sorting out, inheriting, and carrying forward the traditional arts of various ethnic groups.

    The theoretical research work on the literature and art of ethnic minorities has attracted attention from all parties. Some regions have established specialized art research institutions, published art research materials and publications, and achieved certain results; some central art research units have also set up specialized research groups. This will play an important role in promoting the rapid development of the art of various ethnic groups.

    All these brilliant achievements are the victory of the Party's policy of national unity, national equality, and national prosperity, and the result of the correct implementation of the Party's literary and artistic policy of serving politics, serving production, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, letting a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and combining popularization and improvement, as well as the active efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and the broad masses of literary and artistic workers. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao of the Party and the people of all ethnic groups, the splendid art flowers of the motherland's multi-ethnic groups will bloom more gloriously!

    民族艺术花朵日益繁荣
    肖英　张曼
    我国五十多个兄弟民族，都有着自己优秀的文学艺术传统；他们能歌善舞，创造了极其丰富的艺术财产。这些富有强烈人民性的文学艺术，过去在艰苦、黑暗的岁月里，曾成为广大劳动人民生活斗争中不可缺少的锐利的武器。他们深深热爱着它们，用各种方式将它们保存下来，广泛流传。但是，几千年来，特别是近百年以来，少数民族的人民，一直受着帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义以及奴隶主的重重压迫，不但在政治上、经济上没有平等的权利，而且各民族的文学艺术，也都处于被歧视、被排斥，乃至被扼杀的境地。历代的反动统治阶级及其他反动势力，为了加强对少数民族的精神统治，不仅对他们宣传封建道德和散布民族自卑感；而且制订了许许多多的禁条、禁令，甚至用武力来对付各民族人民的文学艺术活动。在这种种的压迫下，少数民族的文学艺术遭受到极其残酷的摧残和蹂躏。到了解放前夕，少数民族的专业艺术团体和专业文艺工作者，已寥寥无几了；许多宝贵的艺术遗产残缺不全，有的甚至早已佚失；尚在流传着的文艺形式，也是比较单调的了。
    中华人民共和国的诞生，永远结束了民族压迫、民族歧视、民族同化的罪恶历史，开始了民族平等、民族团结、民族繁荣的新纪元。十年来，随着政治、经济、文化建设的飞跃发展，人民物质生活和文化水平的不断提高；各民族的文学艺术事业在党和政府的领导关怀下，得到了空前的发展和繁荣，并取得了辉煌成绩。
    群众艺术的蓬勃发展
    解放以来，少数民族地区的群众艺术活动，在党的百花齐放、推陈出新的文艺方针和业余自愿，小型多样的原则指导下，围绕着生产斗争和各个时期的中心任务，蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。许多人民公社都有了自己的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术等等各种业余艺术组织，并且涌现出了成千上万的文艺活动积极分子和文艺骨干。各族劳动人民的艺术才能得到了充分的表现和发挥。他们在继承本民族的优秀传统的基础上，运用和发展着各种民间艺术形式，如蒙族的“牧歌”、朝鲜族的“集体舞”、藏族的“囊玛”、维族的“单人舞”、侗族的“大歌”、苗族的“飞歌”和“籚笙”……以及各种说唱形式和工艺美术等等，在劳动人民的智慧创造下，都比过去更加光彩了。在国民党统治时期，被禁止、被摧残而得不到发展的僮戏、侗戏、藏戏、傣戏、土戏、白族吹吹腔等民族剧种，解放后都已经相继恢复、发展起来；经过同专业文艺工作者的共同努力，挖掘和整理出大量优秀剧目（其中个别剧种已成立了专业剧团）。这些剧目（如藏戏“郎萨越得东巴”、侗戏“珠郎与娘梅”、僮戏“红铜鼓”等），都是反映少数民族人民生活和斗争的宝贵艺术财产。
    由于生产关系、生产方式、生活内容发生了根本性质的改变，因而，风俗习惯、欣赏习惯也在逐渐变化。表现在各个民族的艺术形式和内容上也都有了相应的新的发展。过去有些带有封建迷信色彩的活动形式，经过一定的改革、改造后，已成为健康的、对社会主义有利的艺术武器。如云南大理白族自治州有名的“绕山林”，本来是一种用来向本主祷告的歌舞形式，但现在它已经发展成为歌颂新生活、歌颂大跃进的群众文艺活动形式了。而更使人感到高兴的是彝族、苗族、土家族的人民，已经从山歌的基础上创造出自己的“彝剧”、“苗语剧”、“土语剧”等新的剧种和剧目。各族人民在实际生活中感受到了幸福，他们衷心地歌颂党的领袖、党的领导，歌颂丰收，歌颂劳动英雄，歌颂兄弟民族大团结，歌颂整个的新生活、新时代。他们欢欣鼓舞，充满了信心，那种在重重压迫下的低沉的调子再也听不到了。特别是1958年大跃进以来，在总路线的鼓舞下，少数民族地区和全国各地一样，出现了诗画满墙、歌声遍野、百花齐放、艺术创作空前繁盛的崭新的局面。专业艺术队伍的迅速成长
    在这样一个规模庞大、蓬蓬勃勃的群众艺术发展的基础上，为劳动人民服务，同时又辅助群众艺术发展的各种文艺机构和专业艺术团体，得到了迅速的增长。各自治区和80％以上的自治州，乃至不少的自治县，都有了自己的专业歌舞团、剧团或文工团。比起解放前，在数量上增加了二十余倍。历年来，党和政府采取了各种措施，为各个少数民族培养了大批文艺干部。除中央民族学院设有专门培养民族干部的艺术系和各个自治区建立的高等、中等艺术院（校）外，全国二十多个高等艺术院（校）中，少数民族的学生也占着一定的比例，连同历年来开办的各种艺术专业训练班、学习班等，使上万人的民族文艺工作者队伍迅速地成长和壮大起来了。目前仅新疆维吾尔自治区，就有五十二个专业文工团和剧团，有作家、艺术家和专业文艺工作者三千多人。
    这是一支力量雄厚的文艺大军。这支队伍在参加一系列的社会改革和政治运动中，进行了思想改造，特别是经过整风、反右、反大汉族主义和地方民族主义的斗争，以及下放劳动锻炼，使他们受到了深刻的教育；因而，在政治上、思想上得到了显著的提高；汉族干部和兄弟民族干部更加亲密团结。十年来，他们在各级党委的领导下，一贯遵循着党的文艺方针，广泛地深入和联系工农兵群众，走向农村、牧区、厂矿和部队，创作和演出了许多优秀的文学艺术作品；紧密地配合了各个时期的政治运动和生产斗争；有力地教育和鼓舞了人民的斗争意志和建设社会主义的劳动热情；辅导和推动了群众业余文艺活动。如广西僮族自治区歌舞团、内蒙古自治区歌舞团等，经常爬山越岭、长途跋涉、深入山区和草原，为群众演出和进行辅导工作。类似这样的活动，已经成为民族地区专业艺术团体光荣的、经常性的任务了。人才辈出，艺术质量大大提高由于贯彻执行了党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，不同风格、不同题材的作品和多种多样的艺术形式，都得到了充分的展现和发挥；优秀的艺术人才，愈来愈多地涌现出来。像出色的说唱艺人毛依罕、爬杰、马头琴艺人色拉西（蒙族）等；歌唱演员宝音德力格尔（蒙族）、方初善（朝鲜族）、阿衣木泥沙巴夏（维族）、阿泡（苗族）、白秀贞（彝族）、才丹（藏族）等；舞蹈演员阿米娜、明娜娃（维族）、欧米加参（藏族）等；作曲家郑镇玉（朝鲜族）、金国富（彝族）等；以及其他许多出色的艺术家。他们杰出的艺术表演和艺术创作，受到了国内外广大人民的热烈欢迎和赞赏。各民族的文艺工作者和民间老艺人紧密合作，在继承传统的基础上，整理加工了大批优秀的艺术节目。如：朝鲜族的“扇舞”，傣族的“孔雀舞”，维吾尔族的“种瓜舞”，藏族的“草原上的‘热巴’”，蒙族的“鄂尔多斯”和“挤奶员舞”，以及撒尼族的“远方的客人请你留下”、朝鲜族的“闺女之歌”等歌曲……。这些节目不仅被国内各民族人民所喜爱和广为流传，而且都是我国参加历届世界青年联欢节比赛获奖的优秀节目，它们充分显示了我国少数民族艺术的丰富多采，和优异的艺术才能，给世界人民留下了深刻的印象。
    十年来，通过历次的区域性、全国性的会演和巡回演出，各族人民进行了广泛的文化艺术交流。大家互相学习，互相吸收，使各族人民艺术增添了新的光彩。少数民族的许多歌舞节目，被汉族地区的专业或业余艺术团体广为吸收并经常上演。而汉族的甚至国外的一些艺术形式和剧目（如话剧、歌舞剧、舞剧和各种地方戏；合唱、合奏、油画、国画等）也被各民族地区的专业和业余艺术团体所吸收，所介绍，并充分运用它们来表达本民族人民的思想感情。这种互相影响，互相吸收，使各族人民的艺术在继承和发扬本民族的优秀传统与独特风格的基础之上，得到了进一步丰富和发展。
    挖掘整理工作取得显著成绩
    建国以来，党和政府采取了各种积极措施，发动了广大文艺工作者和人民群众，对各民族民间流传的艺术进行了挖掘、收集和整理工作。几十万种古典文学、口头文学、民歌曲、乐曲、民间舞蹈、民间工艺美术品被收集起来，并且有很多已经整理出版或正在陆续出版。这里特别值得提到的是，许多流传在民间历史悠久的珍贵遗产（如新疆维吾尔族的古典音乐“十二部木卡姆”、纳西族包括十大乐章的元代器乐曲“别司歇里”及侗族的“大歌”等），也在中央和各级党委的关怀领导下，初步挖掘出来或正在继续挖掘中。各民族的民间老艺人，解放后得到党和政府的极大关怀和重视，生活上得到了妥善安置和照顾，他们在发掘、整理和继承、发扬各民族传统艺术的工作中，贡献出了很大的力量。
    少数民族文学艺术的理论研究工作，已引起各方面的重视。有些地区成立了专门的艺术研究机构，出版了艺术研究资料和刊物，并取得了一定成就；中央的一些艺术研究单位也已设立了专门的研究小组。这对推动各民族艺术的迅速发展，将会起重要的作用。
    这一切辉煌成绩，是党的民族团结、民族平等、民族繁荣政策的胜利，是正确贯彻执行了党的文艺为政治服务、为生产服务、为工农兵服务、百花齐放、推陈出新、普及与提高相结合的文艺方针和各族人民以及广大文艺工作者积极努力的结果。在党和各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，祖国多民族的绚丽的艺术花朵将会开放得更加光辉灿烂！
