    Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: TASS Moscow, September 18th: "Pravda" published an editorial today commenting on the great significance of Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States.

    The editorial said that in the past few days, all of humanity has been paying attention to the visit of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the United States. Peace-loving Americans (who constitute the vast majority of American residents) warmly and sincerely welcomed the head of the Soviet government. Hundreds of thousands of Washington citizens gathered on the streets to welcome the Soviet guest. In Washington, Khrushchev held the first few meetings with Eisenhower and began talks of great international significance. According to the initial talks, the pointer on the barometer of U.S.-Soviet relations is pointing to "sunny skies."

    Our warm send-off to Khrushchev's visit to the United States once again eloquently proves the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party and the people, and the solidarity of the Soviet working people around their beloved government.

    The send-off meeting was held at a time of great significance, that is, after our country achieved a brilliant victory in science and technology—the successful launch of a cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union to the moon.

    People of all countries see from this victory of world historical significance the powerful strength of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's love of peace, and the great superiority of the socialist system. The Soviet people are advancing towards the universe at an unstoppable pace, and at the same time, they are striding forward in their own country at this unstoppable pace. The achievements of the Soviet people make the working people of other socialist countries and all friends of peace and progress feel infinite joy. The strength of the Soviet state promotes the cause of peace.

    The editorial said that everyone clearly knows that the Soviet state is pursuing a clear and realistic foreign policy of peace, and it has always been committed to easing international tensions and ensuring peaceful coexistence. The Soviet Union hopes to reach an agreement with the United States on the most important issues, first of all on easing international tensions and eliminating the "Cold War," on disarmament, on a peace treaty with Germany, on the development of international trade, and on improving Soviet-American relations.

    The editorial said that not only the Soviet people and the vast majority of Americans, but also millions upon millions of people in all other countries are very concerned about ending the "Cold War" and restoring the traditional friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, which was forged in blood on the battlefield against fascist tyranny.

    The editorial emphasized that this U.S.-Soviet meeting will help achieve this. But one thing is essential, and that is that everyone participating in the meeting should, like the Soviet side, take the desire to strengthen peace as the main and fundamental position. If there is a mutual desire to ease international tensions, outstanding disputes can be completely resolved.

    The editorial continued that, of course, no sane person would expect the U.S.-Soviet meeting to lead to the resolution of all contentious issues. In the years of the "Cold War," a lot of things that can easily cause fire have accumulated in international relations, and it is impossible to remove the fuse all at once, but it is necessary to start this important work immediately.

    The editorial concluded by pointing out that, with the exception of a small group of arms dealers and shameless militarists, all mankind warmly welcomes the mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States, and hopes that they will achieve friendly consensus for the consolidation of peace and the security of all nations.

    The speeches made by the head of the Soviet government in the United States, full of the spirit of peace and the desire to eliminate the "Cold War," have aroused great interest everywhere.

    Every kind person agrees with the Soviet people's heartfelt wishes for Comrade Khrushchev: I wish you success in your noble mission of peace and friendship!

### 苏联“真理报”评赫鲁晓夫访美的重大意义  苏美关系晴雨表初报晴天

    苏联“真理报”评赫鲁晓夫访美的重大意义
    苏美关系晴雨表初报晴天
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：“真理报”今天发表社论，评述赫鲁晓夫同志访美的重大意义。
    社论说，这几天，全人类都在注视着苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志在美国的访问。爱好和平的美国人（他们占美国居民的绝大多数）热烈而真挚地欢迎苏联政府首脑。成千上万的华盛顿市民齐集街头欢迎苏联贵宾。在华盛顿，赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔举行了最初几次会晤，开始了具有重大国际意义的会谈。根据最初的会谈来看，苏美关系晴雨表的指针指向“晴天”。
    我国热烈欢送赫鲁晓夫访美再一次雄辩地证明共产党和人民的牢不可破的团结，苏联劳动人民团结在自己亲爱的政府的周围。
    欢送会是在具有重大意义的时刻举行的，即在我国取得科学技术上的辉煌胜利——苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭成功以后举行的。
    各国人民从这个具有世界历史意义的胜利中看到了苏联的强大力量，看到苏联爱好和平，看到了社会主义制度的巨大优越性，苏联人民正在以势不可挡的步伐奔向宇宙，同时，他们也以这种势不可挡的步伐在本国阔步前进。苏联人民的成就使其他社会主义国家的劳动人民、所有和平和进步的朋友感到无限的高兴。苏维埃国家的强大促进了和平事业。
    社论说，每一个人都清楚地知道，苏维埃国家执行的是明确而现实的和平外交政策，它一直致力于缓和国际紧张局势，致力于保障和平共处。苏联希望同美国就最重要的问题达成协议，首先是就缓和国际紧张局势和消除“冷战”问题、裁军问题、对德和约问题、发展国际贸易问题、改善苏美关系问题达成协议。
    社论说，不仅苏联人和绝大多数美国人，而且千千万万的所有其他国家的人也非常关心结束“冷战”，恢复苏美两国人民在反对法西斯暴虐的战场上用鲜血凝结成的传统友谊。
    社论强调指出，这次苏美会晤有助于实现这一点。但是有一点是不可少的，这就是每个参加会见的人都应该像苏联方面那样，把对加强和平的愿望作为主要的基本的立场。如果彼此都有缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，悬而未决的争端是完全可以解决的。
    社论接着说，当然，任何一个理智健全的人也不会指望苏美会见会导致全部争执问题的解决。在“冷战”年代里，在国际关系中积存了不少容易引起火灾的东西，而且不可能一下子拆除导火线，但是必须立即着手进行这项重要的工作。
    社论最后指出，除了一小撮军火商人和无耻的军国主义者以外，全人类都热烈欢迎苏美两国政府首脑的互相访问，并希望他们为巩固和平和各国人民的安全而取得友好的一致。
    苏联政府首脑在美国发表的充满和平精神和消除“冷战”愿望的演说到处都引起了极大的兴趣。
    每一个善良的人都赞同苏联人民对赫鲁晓夫同志这样的衷心祝愿：祝您在崇高的和平和友谊的使命中得到成功！
