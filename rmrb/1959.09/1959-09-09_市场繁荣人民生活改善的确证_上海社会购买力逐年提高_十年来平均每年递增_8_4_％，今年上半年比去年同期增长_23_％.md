(Reported by this newspaper) The purchasing power of the working people in Shanghai has been steadily rising since liberation, thanks to the development of industrial and agricultural production. According to statistics, since 1950, Shanghai's social commodity purchasing power has increased by an average of 8.4% annually; particularly since the Great Leap Forward last year, the growth has been even faster, with a 23% increase in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.

On the basis of continuous development in production, the purchase of various commodities such as food, clothing, and daily necessities by the city's working people has increased significantly every year over the past decade. Taking 1950 as 100, the purchasing power of the city's people in terms of food in 1958 was 189; in terms of clothing, 1958 was 200; and in terms of daily necessities, 1958 was 176.4.

Over the past decade, due to the increase in social commodity purchasing power, the total value of goods supplied in Shanghai's retail market has increased by 90%. In the city's tens of thousands of stores, not only has the supply of goods continuously increased, but also the variety of goods has become richer and richer in order to meet the diverse needs of the people, with even greater increases in the supply of many major commodities. For example, comparing 1958 with 1953, the retail volume of grain, fresh eggs, etc., increased by 10% to 20%; vegetables, rubber shoes, wool yarn, socks, and bicycles increased by 20% to 50%; woolen fabrics, towels, undershirts, and machine-made paper increased by 50% to 80%; and biscuits, cotton interlock underwear, enamel products, clocks, etc., increased by more than 100%.

After the widespread improvement of material life, the broad masses of working people have also increasingly raised their demands for cultural life. Therefore, they not only need general commodities, but also their purchasing power for cultural goods and high-end commodities is constantly increasing. For example, the average number of fountain pens and ballpoint pens purchased per 100 people increased from 14 in 1953 to 18.4 in 1958; the average amount of machine-made paper purchased per 100 people increased from 84.8 kilograms in 1953 to 144.8 kilograms in 1958; the average number of radios purchased per 10,000 people increased from 9.2 in 1953 to 68 in 1958; and the average number of bicycles purchased per 10,000 people increased from 27.3 in 1953 to 35 in 1958.

Shanghai's social commodity purchasing power level has been increasing year by year. Especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, the rapid development of production, capital construction, and various undertakings has led to a rapid expansion of social employment, with an increase of 180,000 employees. In addition, many neighborhood women have joined the workforce, which has led to a particularly rapid increase in urban purchasing power. Compared with the same period last year, the average monthly income increased by 20 million yuan in the first half of this year. The social purchasing power from January to August this year increased by 17.3% compared to the same period last year. Compared with the same period last year, retail sales in the first half of this year increased by 25% for cotton cloth and woolen fabrics, 59.4% for socks, 76.2% for undershirts, and more than 100% for rubber shoes, fountain pens, wool yarn, bicycles, and clocks.

On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, the people's purchasing power will continue to increase, and the living standards of the people will continue to improve. (Attached photo)

    市场繁荣人民生活改善的确证
    上海社会购买力逐年提高
    十年来平均每年递增8.4％，今年上半年比去年同期增长23％
    本报讯　随着工农业生产的发展，上海市劳动人民的购买力在解放以来的十年中不断上升。据统计，自1950年以来，上海社会商品购买力，平均每年递增8.4％；特别自去年大跃进以来，增长得更快，今年上半年比去年同期增长了23％。
    在生产不断发展的基础上，十年来全市劳动人民购买的吃、穿、用等各种商品，每年都有很大的增长。如果以1950年为一百，全市人民在食品方面的购买力，1958年为一百八十九；在衣着方面的购买力，1958年为二百；在日用品方面的购买力，1958年为一百七十六点四。
  十年来，由于社会商品购买力的提高，上海零售市场供应的商品总额增加了九成，在全市数万家商店里，不仅商品的供应量不断增加，为了多方面满足人民需要，商品的花色品种也愈来愈丰富，许多主要的商品供应量增加的幅度更大。如以1958年与1953年相比，零售量增加10％到20％的有粮食、鲜蛋等；增长20％到50％的有蔬菜、胶鞋、毛线、袜子和自行车等；增长50％到80％的有呢绒、毛巾、汗衫背心和机制纸等，增长一倍以上的有饼干、棉毛衫裤、搪瓷制品、钟等等。
    广大劳动人民在物质生活获得普遍改善之后，对文化生活的要求也日益提高，因此他们不仅需要一般的商品，而且对文化用品和高档商品的购买能力也不断提高。例如金笔和钢笔在1953年平均每百人购买十四支，到1958年增为十八点四支；机制纸在1953年平均每百人购买八十四点八公斤，到1958年增为一百四十四点八公斤；收音机在1953年平均每一万人中购买九点二架，到1958年增为六十八架；自行车在1953年平均每一万人中购买二十七点三辆，到1958年增为三十五辆。
    上海的社会商品购买力的水平逐年提高，特别自去年大跃进以来，由于生产、基本建设和各项事业发展得快，因而社会就业面迅速扩大，职工人数增加了十八万人，加以许多里弄妇女参加劳动，使城市购买力增加的特别快。今年上半年和去年同期相较，平均每月收入增加二千万元。今年1至8月的社会购买力，比去年同期增加17.3％；今年上半年零售商品与去年同期比较，棉布和呢绒增长25％，袜子增长59.4％，汗衫背心增长76.2％，胶鞋、金笔、毛线、自行车和钟等增长一倍以上。
    在工农业生产发展的基础上，人民购买力将继续不断地提高，人民群众的生活水平将不断地改善。（附图片）
