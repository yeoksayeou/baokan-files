Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 22nd: As of the 20th, 465 factories in ten major cities in Jiangsu Province had completed their September production plans ahead of schedule. With heroic spirit, the workers of these factories put forward the slogan "Present a great gift before the festival, and have a good start after the festival," determined to finish the work of early October in late September, as a gift to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a huge force encouraging workers everywhere to complete their plans ahead of schedule. At the beginning of September, the workers set ambitious goals to make September the best month for completing plans this year. Many factories revised their plans and raised production targets. The masses of workers launched a surging movement to increase production and practice economy. According to incomplete statistics, nearly a thousand factories in Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Changzhou have established counterpart relationships, with approximately 400,000 workers participating in the competition. During the competition, workers actively offered suggestions and ideas, focusing on key production issues and carrying out technological innovations on a large scale. In the industrial front of Changzhou City alone, workers put forward more than 90,000 innovation proposals in early September. Workers in factories in Xuzhou supported and promoted each other in the competition. In order to assist Yuejin Steel Plant in breaking through key production issues, the Party Secretary of Huaihai Steel Plant personally led experienced blast furnace foremen, shift leaders, technicians, and other blast furnace production personnel to Yuejin Plant to assist, working with the workers of Yuejin Plant to identify key issues, find reasons, and devise solutions for each furnace, teaching them their experience. As a result, the output of Yuejin Plant's two blast furnaces increased day by day, from 44.4 tons of iron on September 13th to 50.3 tons on the 14th, and then to over 60 tons on the 15th and 16th.

Leading cadres at all levels in various cities, in the spirit of grasping things firmly, meticulously, deeply, and thoroughly, went deep into the front line to focus on production progress. At the beginning of the competition, the Changzhou Municipal Party Committee listed the main indicators of various industries in a table, commanding operations with charts. Production progress was announced every day, checked every five days, and evaluated every ten days. Advanced experiences were immediately promoted, and problems were studied and resolved in a timely manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 23rd: Seventy-five factories in Shenyang have already fulfilled their pledges to offer gifts to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, and have recently completed their third-quarter output value and production plans ahead of schedule.

These factories include Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang Water Pump Plant, Shenyang Fan Plant, Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant, and Shenyang Bridge Plant, which occupy important positions in the national machinery industry. In addition, there are also Shenyang Glass Factory, Shenyang Ceramics Factory, Shenyang Brewery, and various factories under the Shenyang Rubber Company.

These factories not only made outstanding achievements in terms of output value and production in the third quarter, but also excelled in ensuring product quality and reducing material consumption. For example, Shenyang Steel Plant, which completed its third-quarter steel production plan twelve days ahead of schedule, improved the qualified rate of steel ingots by 3.81% compared to the plan, the first-class product rate by 4.75% compared to the plan, and reduced the unit consumption of pig iron by 8.3% compared to the plan.

Since August, workers in various factories have been opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting their enthusiasm, and launching a vigorous new upsurge in the competition to offer gifts to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. Leading cadres and some office personnel in various factories have personally gone to the front line of production to direct production, and problems are resolved on the spot. The mass campaign for technological innovation is a prominent feature of this new upsurge. Workers at Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant put forward 492 technological innovation projects in just twenty-four days in August. There were 293 workers whose production efficiency increased by more than 100% across the plant, and this number increased to 947 in early September.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 23rd: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, 600,000 workers in Chongqing are engaged in a fierce competition, and the production level of various industries is soaring, with good news pouring in frequently.

In the first twenty days of September, the total output value of the city's industrial system increased by 45.52% compared to the same period in August; the average daily output of steel in the city increased by 40.37%, iron increased by 32.24%, and coal increased by 22.07%. As of the 20th, 45 factories in the city had completed their third-quarter plans ahead of schedule. Hundreds of workshops and teams have completed their plans ahead of schedule. Six factories, including Construction Machine Tool Plant, Air Compressor Plant, and Chongqing Silk Textile Plant, have more than 200 work sections and teams that have completed their third-quarter and September plans.

Many units and individuals have been catching up in the competition and have realized a large number of technological innovation proposals and created many new records. Nine factories, including Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Jiangling Machine Factory, and Construction Machine Tool Plant, realized more than 40,000 technological innovation proposals and created tens of thousands of new records in twenty days in September. The original product plan for Workshop 35 of Construction Machine Tool Plant in September increased by 77% compared to the actual output in August, and eight new varieties were added, doubling the task and making it extremely difficult. However, in the opponent competition, the "Skillful Girls" team took the lead in completing the entire month's plan in eleven working days. Then, the male workers' teams worked hard to catch up, and all twenty-seven teams completed the monthly plan ahead of schedule. Chuanjiang workers also made many outstanding achievements before National Day. The Yangtze River No. 2006, piloted by outstanding captain Xu Mingzhou, set a new record in mid-September by towing 4,321 cubic meters of wood from Chongqing to Yichang in just three days.

In the opponent competition, with comparing output, quality, and cost as the main conditions, many units greatly improved quality and reduced costs. The quality of 21-count yarn in Shashi Yarn Factory quickly increased from 87.5% in August to 100% in the first half of September; 610 Textile Dyeing Factory, which completed its third-quarter plan ahead of schedule, also created an excellent achievement of 100% quality for 32-count yarn in the first half of September.

    技术大革新　生产大跃进
    江苏、沈阳、重庆一批工厂提前完成计划
    据新华社南京22日电　到20日为止，江苏省十个较大城市已有四百六十五个工厂提前完成9月份的生产计划。这批工厂的职工又以豪迈的气概，提出了“节前献大礼，节后开门红”的口号，决心在9月下旬提前干完10月上旬的活，向建国十周年献礼。
    党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，是鼓舞各地职工提前完成计划的巨大力量。9月一开始，职工们就立下了雄心大志，要使9月成为今年以来完成计划最好的一个月。许多工厂修订了计划，提高了生产指标。职工群众掀起了汹涌澎湃的增产节约运动。据不完全统计，南京、徐州、常州三个市就有近千家工厂对口挂钩，约四十万职工参加了竞赛。在竞赛中，职工们纷纷献谋献计，针对生产关键，大搞技术革新。常州市工业战线的职工仅在9月上旬就提出革新建议九万多件。徐州市各工厂职工在竞赛中互相支援，互相促进。淮海钢铁厂为了协助跃进钢铁厂突破生产关键，党委书记亲自率领技术好的高炉炉长、值班长、技术员等全班高炉生产人员上门协助，和跃进厂职工一道逐炉排关键、找原因、想办法，把经验教给他们，结果使跃进厂的两座高炉产量逐日提高，9月13日产铁四十四点四吨，14日提高到五十点三吨，15日、16日两天又提高到六十吨以上。
    各城市的各级领导干部本着抓狠抓细抓深抓透的精神，深入现场，狠抓生产进度。中共常州市委在竞赛一开始就把各行各业的主要指标列出表来，挂图指挥作战，生产进度每天一公布，五天一检查，十天一评比，发现先进经验立即推广，发现问题及时研究解决。
    据新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳市已有七十五个工厂提前实现向建国十周年献礼的保证，在最近都先后提前完成了第三季度的产值和产量计划。
    这些工厂，包括在全国机械工业中占有重要地位的沈阳第一机床厂，沈阳第二机床厂，沈阳水泵厂，沈阳扇风机厂，东北机器制造厂，沈阳桥梁厂等。此外，还有沈阳玻璃厂，沈阳陶瓷厂，沈阳啤酒厂，以及沈阳市橡胶公司所属各厂等。
    这些工厂在第三季度不仅在产值、产量方面作出了优异成绩，而且在保证产品质量和降低材料消耗方面也很出色。例如提前十二天完成第三季度钢的生产计划的沈阳钢厂，钢锭合格率比计划提高了3.81％，一级品率比计划提高了4.75％，生铁单位消耗比计划降低了8.3％。
    各厂职工从8月以来，反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起了轰轰烈烈的向建国十周年献礼的竞赛新高潮。各个工厂的领导干部和一些科室人员，都亲临生产第一线指挥生产，发现问题，就地解决。群众性大闹技术革新，更是这次新高潮的突出特点。沈阳第二机床厂的职工，仅仅在8月份的二十四天当中就提出技术革新项目四百九十二件；全厂生产效率提高一倍以上的工人有二百九十三名，9月上旬又增加到九百四十七名。
    据新华社重庆23日电　建国十周年前夕，重庆市六十万职工正如火如荼地展开对手竞赛，各行各业的生产水平飞跃上升，捷报频传。
    9月份前二十天，全市市属工业系统的总产值比8月份同期猛增了45.52％；全市钢的平均日产量增长了40.37％，铁增长了32.24％，煤增长了22.07％。到20日止，全市四十五个工厂已经提前完成了第三季度计划。提前完成计划的车间、小组更是数以百计。仅建设机床厂、空气压缩机厂、重庆丝纺厂等六个厂，完成第三季度和9月份计划的工段、小组就在二百个以上。
    许多单位和个人，在对手赛中猛追猛赶，实现了大量技术革新建议，创造了许多新纪录。重庆钢铁公司、江陵机器厂、建设机床厂等九个工厂，9月份二十天即实现了技术革新建议四万多件，创造了上万个新纪录。建设机床厂三十五车间9月份原定的产品计划比8月份实际增加77％，并且新增了八个品种，任务加番，异常吃重。但是在开展对手赛中，“巧姑娘”小组首先就以十一个工作日完成了全月计划。接着各男工组奋起直追，二十七个小组都提前完成了月计划。川江职工在国庆前夕也做出了许多出色成绩。优秀船长徐明周领航的长江二○○六轮，9月中旬创造了拖带四千三百二十一立方木材、只用三天时间就由重庆到达宜昌的新纪录。
    在以比产量、比质量、比成本为主要条件的对手赛中，许多单位大大提高了质量，降低了成本。沙市纱厂二十一支纱的质量迅速由8月份的87.5％提高到9月份上半月的100％；提前完成第三季度计划的六一○纺织染厂，9月份上半月三十二支纱的质量也创造了100％的优异成绩。
