Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The vigorous development of the national campaign to increase production and practice economy, coupled with the autumn procurement and transfer of large quantities of agricultural products, has brought extremely heavy tasks to transportation, especially short-distance transportation.

According to estimates from relevant ministries of the Central Government and 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the volume of short-distance freight transportation across the country from September to December this year will reach 900 million tons. Coal, agricultural products, and building materials will account for the largest quantity, followed by pig iron, ore, timber, and other materials. Actively organizing rural manpower and transportation tools, and taking advantage of agricultural breaks to launch a vigorous mass movement for short-distance transportation, is of great significance for ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's national economic plans for steel, coal, and other industries. To this end, the Ministry of Communications convened a national short-distance transportation telephone conference on the 5th to deploy this work.

Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo, spoke at the meeting. He reported in detail on the new achievements made by various regions and factories and mines in opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued its call. He said that the nation's transportation work, like other departments, has also made great leaps forward, but it still cannot meet the growing needs of industrial and agricultural production, and short-distance transportation is currently the weakest link in the entire development of industrial and agricultural production. At present, many materials urgently needed by the national economy are stockpiled in production areas and cannot be transported out. Therefore, utilizing agricultural slack periods, and based on the specific conditions of each region, seizing the opportunity to launch a large-scale mass movement for short-distance transportation has become an urgent combat task. The most important task at present is to rush the transportation of coal urgently needed for external transfer stockpiled in mining areas and the coal for continued production.

Minister of Communications Wang Shoudao, in his speech, emphasized many important experiences and favorable conditions for carrying out the mass movement for short-distance transportation. He requested that all localities, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, do the following: (1) Actively organize the mass transportation force. First, based on needs and possibilities, organize professional transportation teams based on production teams within the People's Communes. At the same time, vigorously organize sideline transportation teams, utilizing agricultural breaks to participate in temporary, intensive transportation. (2) Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, establish and improve transportation command posts including transportation departments and major material departments, strengthen transportation organization and collaboration, and, based on the degree of urgency, prioritize material transportation and balance transportation capacity with transportation volume, and organize rational transportation. (3) It is imperative to implement the method of paying according to labor and paying freight charges. This should both ensure the reasonable income of the masses and prevent excessively high freight rates. (4) In order to improve transportation efficiency and save labor, vigorously carry out technical innovations, and begin early to repair transportation tools, repair roads, and dredge waterways. Strengthen the maintenance and repair of existing tools and equipment. (5) Vigorously strengthen loading and unloading operations at ports, railway, and highway stations, promote various effective technical innovation experiences, such as palletization and the use of handling vehicles, and accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships.

Minister of the Coal Industry Zhang Linzhi, Vice Minister of the Metallurgical Industry Lu Dong, Vice Minister of Railways Lü Zhengcao, and Vice Minister of Commerce Zeng Chuanliu also spoke at the meeting on issues such as short-distance transportation of coal, ore, pig iron, grain, commercial, and foreign trade materials, the coordination of long-distance and short-distance transportation, and the collaboration between material departments and transportation departments.

    交通部召开电话会议部署当前工作
    开展群众运动大搞短途运输
    新华社9日讯　全国增产节约运动的蓬勃开展和秋季大量农产品的采购调运，给交通运输特别是短途运输带来了非常繁重的任务。
    根据中央有关各部和二十四个省、市、自治区的估算，今年9月至12月内全国各地短途运输的货运量将达九亿吨；其中煤炭、农产品、建筑材料的数量最多，生铁、矿石、木材等物资次之，积极组织农村的人力和运输工具，利用农事间隙，开展一个轰轰烈烈的短途运输的群众运动，对保证完成和超额完成今年钢铁、煤炭等国民经济计划，具有十分重大的意义。交通部为此在5日召开了全国短途运输电话会议，部署了这一工作。
    国务院副总理薄一波在会上讲了话。他详细地报告了党的八届八中全会发出号召以后，各地各厂矿反右倾、鼓干劲、大力开展增产节约运动所取得的新成就。他说，全国的运输工作也像其他部门一样有了很大的跃进，但是还不能满足工农业生产日益增长的需要，而短途运输更是当前整个工农业生产发展中最薄弱的一个环节。现在有许多国民经济急需的物资积压在生产地区运不出来。因之，利用农暇，根据各地具体情况，掌握时机，开展一个声势浩大的短途运输的群众运动，已成为当前一个迫切的战斗任务。当前最重要的是把积存在矿区急需外调的煤炭和继续生产的煤炭抢运出来。
    交通部部长王首道在讲话中强调指出了开展短途运输群众运动的许多重要经验和有利条件。他要求各个地方在党委统一领导下做好如下几项工作：（一）积极组织群众运输力量。首先要根据需要和可能把人民公社内以生产队为基础的专业运输队组织起来，同时要大力组织副业运输队，利用农事间隙，参加临时性的突击运输。（二）在各地党委的统一领导下，建立和健全包括运输部门和主要物资部门的运输指挥部，加强运输组织工作和协作工作，并且根据轻重缓急，做好物资运输排队和运力与运量的平衡工作，组织合理运输。（三）必须贯彻按劳付酬、支付运费的办法。既要保证群众的合理收入，也要防止运价过高的现象。（四）为了提高运输效率，节省劳动力，要大搞技术革新，并且及早动手修理运输工具，整修道路，疏浚航道。加强对现有工具设备的保养维修工作。（五）大力加强港口、铁路和公路车站的装卸工作，推行各种行之有效的技术革新经验，如滑板化、搬运车子化等，加快车船周转。
    煤炭工业部部长张霖之、冶金工业部副部长吕东、铁道部副部长吕正操和商业部副部长曾传六，也在会上就煤炭、矿石、生铁、粮食、商业、外贸等物资的短途运输、长途与短途配合，以及物资部门和运输部门的协作问题讲了话。
