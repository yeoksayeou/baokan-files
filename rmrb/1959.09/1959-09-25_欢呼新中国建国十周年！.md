    Hail the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the New China!
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    Ten years have completed the journey that capitalist countries would take decades or even centuries to complete.

    On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, solemnly announced the founding of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square with a voice that shook the world.

    Since then, the People's Republic of China has stood tall in the world, the Chinese working people have become the masters of the country, and Chinese history has entered a new era.

    That moment of great historical significance has passed in the blink of an eye for ten years. Over the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have been engaged in the greatest cause that our predecessors have never done before, and are building our great motherland at an unprecedented speed. We spent only three years to heal the serious wounds caused by the long-term war, completely eliminate the legacy of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and restore the national economy that was on the verge of collapse; under the righteous banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and defending our country, we defeated the US-launched armed aggression in Korea together with the Korean people, and exposed the paper tiger essence of US imperialism in front of the people of the world. We completed and overfulfilled the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy as scheduled, and established the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country. While carrying out the socialist revolution on the economic front, we also carried out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and both have achieved decisive victories. In 1958, the first year of the second five-year plan, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, China's national economy witnessed an unprecedented all-round great leap forward, and at the same time, China's 500 million farmers demonstrated great determination and wisdom, creating the people's communes. The emergence of the people's communes has greatly promoted the development of production on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has opened up a broad road for our country's rural areas to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. Ten years, from a historical point of view, is a very short period of time, but we have gone through the road that capitalist countries would take decades or even centuries to complete, and the growth rate of China's national economy is beyond the reach of any capitalist country in the world. Ten years ago, on the land of our country, all industries were in decline and people were living in misery; now, the whole country is full of brilliant scenes, the social landscape is changing with each passing day, and the material and cultural living standards of the people are improving day by day. In just ten years, an old China that was bullied, oppressed, and poor and backward has become a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong; in the eyes of Western capitalist countries, the Chinese people have changed from the "sick man of East Asia" to the "Oriental Dragon." This is an earth-shaking change. In this great festival celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we can proudly say that we have very well completed the legacy of our predecessors, and have not disappointed the expectations of all our friends in the world.

      The revolutionary and construction undertakings are constantly leaping from climax to new climax.

    As everyone knows, for more than a hundred years, our ancestors have never stopped fighting against internal and external oppressors, and the great democratic revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen once "devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years." But it was not until the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism and the founding of the Communist Party of China that the face of the Chinese revolution underwent fundamental changes, hope was generated in despair, and victory was achieved from failure. The great Lenin said: "Give us a revolutionary organization, and we can turn Russia upside down!" The reason why our country has been able to undergo earth-shaking changes is because we have a revolutionary organization like the one Lenin demanded - the Communist Party of China.

    In the early days of liberation, we heard people singing "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." This is a truth that the people have summed up from thirty years of historical struggle. Now people can see very clearly that without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would have been impossible for the Chinese people to win the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, let alone overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and establish a new country. The great Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China, "taking Russia as a teacher", creatively applying the Soviet Union's revolutionary experience and construction experience, so that our country's revolutionary cause and construction cause can continue to leap from climax to new climax, and from victory to greater victory.

    The imperialists once slandered that the Communist Party could only lead the revolution but could not lead construction. What are the facts? In just ten years, we have built a prosperous and stable society on the ruins created by the imperialists and domestic reactionary rulers. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the great and correct general line of building socialism formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, our country's socialist construction cause entered a great historical period of "one day equals twenty years." Obviously, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the main targets of the second five-year plan this year, and we will definitely be able to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years! Historical facts have thus ruthlessly shattered the imperialists' slander that the Communist Party cannot lead construction, and have shown the world's people how superior the socialist system is. The victory of China is the victory of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, the victory of the socialist road, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism!

    In the great days of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as we look back on the difficult years of the past, face the happy present, and look forward to the infinitely beautiful future, our respect and gratitude for the great Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao is absolutely beyond what language and words can describe and express even a fraction of. Lenin said that the Communist Party is "the intelligence, honor, and conscience of our era," and the development of Chinese history has once again provided a powerful witness.

      Our country's achievements in the past ten years fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism.

    The imperialists and their spokespersons once fabricated various "grounds" and "theories" to prove that the Chinese people were born to be enslaved by imperialism, and believed that poverty and backwardness were the fate that China could never get rid of. The ruthless historical facts prove that the imperialist elements who put forward these fallacies are a group of the most stupid liars.

    In the past ten years, the Chinese people have used selfless and creative labor to build their great motherland, rapidly changing the backward state of economy and culture. From our country's foundation, it is "poor and blank," but 650 million people and 1.3 billion hands are the greatest "wealth," capable of creating all the miracles that have never existed in history and drawing the most beautiful pictures in the world. Now, we are no longer empty-handed, our country already possesses a large number of modern industrial equipment, and has become one of the countries in the world with huge productivity. Once hundreds of millions of people who are hardworking, simple, industrious, and brave master modern science and technology and combine with the latest machines, its power is immeasurable. We can say with confidence that our country's economic construction cause will develop at a faster pace in the future.

    The great achievements of the People's Republic of China in the ten years since its founding fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism and attract the people in colonial and semi-colonial areas who are eager to gain freedom and liberation, which of course will make the imperialists feel extremely fearful. When the US imperialists and their lackeys are unable to deny the fact that the new China is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, they spread another kind of lie, saying that the soaring enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people for their own happiness is some kind of "slave labor." If it is said that only shedding blood and sweat for the blood-sucking foreign colonialists and the domestic capitalists and landlords is called "freedom," then such a "free world" has indeed long gone and will never return in China. Premier Zhou Enlai said well in his "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress: "Let the gentlemen of the Western bourgeoisie clamor, our workers and peasants have lost nothing except the freedom to be unemployed and starve."

    Why can the same people create unprecedented miracles on the same land? The key lies in the fact that the people were slaves in the past, but now they are masters. The completely liberated Chinese people are engaged in peaceful labor on their own land with the attitude of masters, and their wisdom and strength are endless. Today we are building socialism; tomorrow we will build communism, and we will build our great motherland into a paradise on earth. Every patriotic Chinese citizen is extremely honored and proud to be able to contribute their knowledge and strength to such a noble and great cause!

      "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day" has become a historical law that no force can change. Whether the imperialists scold or cry, they cannot stop the Chinese people from advancing victoriously along the socialist road!

    The support and assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, as well as the people of the world, have enabled our victory to be continuously consolidated and developed; our achievements have also strengthened and consolidated the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and supported the struggle of the people of the world for freedom and liberation, and for peace and democracy.

    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the great achievements made since the founding of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from the sympathy and support of the working people of the world. Chairman Mao taught us in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "In the era of imperialism, the real people's revolution in any country, without the assistance of international revolutionary forces in various ways, cannot achieve its own victory. After victory, it is impossible to consolidate it." At the same time, he emphasized: "Internationally, we belong to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union, and the assistance of true friendship can only be found in this aspect, and not in the aspect of the imperialist front." The historical facts of the past ten years have fully proved Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion.

    The support and assistance given to us by the Soviet Union, socialist brother countries, and the broad masses of people in the world have enabled our victory to be continuously consolidated and developed; at the same time, our achievements have directly and indirectly strengthened and consolidated the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and supported the struggle of the people of the world for freedom and liberation, and for peace and democracy. Our country has become an important force in promoting the cause of human progress and defending world peace, and is increasingly playing an important role in international affairs. Our country is one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is a signatory to the Bandung Principles. We firmly support the national liberation movement and the people's democratic movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and have established trade and economic ties with many nationalist countries. Our government adheres to a peaceful foreign policy and has made significant contributions to the cause of peace, which has been welcomed by all peace-loving countries and people in the world.

    As time goes on, people are increasingly aware of the great historical and international significance of the birth of the People's Republic of China. The broad masses of people all over the world are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with us, congratulating our country on its increasing prosperity and strength. In this great festival, we are very grateful to our friends who support us in all aspects, and at the same time, we despise those enemies who try their best to undermine our just cause by any despicable means!

    In these joyful and encouraging days, we extend our infinite concern to our compatriots in Taiwan who are suffering. The great Chinese people must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan, so that the Taiwan compatriots can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and share socialist prosperity and happiness with us. It will not work for US imperialism to stay in Taiwan. Our just struggle to liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious!

    The members of our democratic parties have generally done a little bit for the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past ten years under the education and help of the Communist Party. To make more contributions in the future, we must continue to strengthen our self-transformation through practice and learning under the leadership of the Communist Party and in our socialist work posts. It is our supreme honor and unparalleled pride to serve the great socialist cause!

    Let us shout in unison:
        Long live the great People's Republic of China!
        Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in China!
        Long live the great Communist Party of China!
        Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China!

    欢呼新中国建国十周年！
    中国国民党革命委员会主席　李济深
    十年走完了资本主义国家要走几十年以至几个世纪的路程
    1949年10月1日，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席在天安门上用震动全世界的声音庄严地宣告了中华人民共和国的成立。
    从此，中华人民共和国巍然屹立于世界，中国劳动人民做了国家的主人，中国历史跨进了新的时代。
    那个具有伟大历史意义的时刻转眼就是十年了。十年来，全国人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，做着我们前人从来没有做过的最伟大的事业，以史无前例的速度建设着我们伟大的祖国。我们仅仅用了三年的时间就医治好了长期战争所造成的严重创伤，彻底消除帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的遗毒，恢复了濒于绝境的国民经济；在抗美援朝、保家卫国的正义旗帜下，同朝鲜人民一道打败了美国在朝鲜发动的武装侵略，在全世界人民的面前戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎的本质。我们如期和超额完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，建立了我国社会主义工业化的初步基础。在经济战线上进行社会主义革命的同时，政治、思想战线上也进行了社会主义革命，并都取得了决定性的胜利。在1958年，即实行第二个五年计划的第一年，我国国民经济在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了一个史无前例的全面大跃进，同时我国五亿农民表现了伟大决心和智慧，创造了人民公社。人民公社的出现，一方面大大促进了生产的发展，同时为我国农村开辟了一条从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的康庄大道。十年，从历史上看，是一个很短的时间，而我们却走过了资本主义国家要走几十年乃至几个世纪的道路，我国国民经济增长的速度是世界上任何资本主义国家望尘莫及的。十年以前，在我国大地上，是百业雕敝、民不聊生；如今全国到处都是一片光辉灿烂的景象，社会面貌日新月异，人民的物质文化生活水平天天向上。仅仅十年，一个被人欺凌压迫和贫困落后的旧中国变成了一个独立、自由、繁荣、昌盛的新中国；在西方资本主义国家的心目中，中国人民由“东亚病夫”变成了“东方巨龙”。这是一个翻天覆地的变化。在这庆祝建国十周年的伟大节日里，我们完全可以自豪地说：我们是很好地完成了先人的遗志，也没有辜负世界上一切朋友们对我们的期望。
      革命事业和建设事业不断地从高潮跃进到新的高潮
    大家知道，一百多年来，我们的先人从来没有停止过反对内外压迫者的斗争，伟大的民主革命家孙中山先生就曾“致力国民革命凡四十年”。但一直到十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义，成立了中国共产党，中国革命的面貌才发生了根本性的变化，在绝望中产生了希望，从失败走向了胜利。伟大的列宁说过这样的话：“给我们一个革命家组织，我们就能把俄国翻转过来！”我国之所以能够发生翻天复地的变革，就是因为我们有了列宁所要求的那样一个革命家组织——中国共产党。
    在解放初期，我们就听见人民在歌唱“没有共产党，就没有新中国”，这是人民从三十年的历史斗争中所总结出来的一条真理。现在人们都看得很清楚，没有共产党的领导，中国人民根本不可能取得抗日战争的胜利，更不可能推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立新的国家。伟大的中国共产党，在以毛泽东主席为首的中央委员会的领导下，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国的具体实际结合起来，“以俄为师”，创造性地运用苏联的革命经验和建设经验，就使我国的革命事业和建设事业能够不断地从高潮跃进到新的高潮，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    帝国主义者曾诋毁共产党只能领导革命而不能领导建设，事实怎样呢？我们在短短十年内，就在帝国主义和国内反动统治者所造成的废墟上建立起了繁荣昌盛、生活安定的社会。1958年，在中共中央和毛主席制定的伟大正确的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的社会主义建设事业进入了一个“一天等于二十年”的伟大历史时期，很显然地，我们在今年一定能够完成和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，一定能在十年左右时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国！历史事实就是这样无情地粉碎了帝国主义所谓共产党不能领导建设的谰言，在全世界人民面前显示了社会主义制度是何等的优越。中国的胜利，是共产党和毛主席领导的胜利，是社会主义道路的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利！
    在庆祝建国十周年的伟大日子里，我们回顾过去的艰难岁月，面对幸福的今天，展望无限美好的将来，我们对于伟大的中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的崇敬和感激，绝对不是语言文字所能形容和表达其万一的。列宁说共产党是“我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心”，中国历史的发展，再一次作了有力的见证。
      我国十年来的成就充分显示了社会主义的优越性
    帝国主义者及其代言人，曾经捏造种种“根据”和“理论”，来证明中国人天生就应该受帝国主义的奴役，认为贫困落后是中国永远不能摆脱的命运。无情的史实证明提出这些谬论的帝国主义分子正是一群最愚蠢的骗子。
    十年来，中国人民以忘我的创造性的劳动建设自己的伟大祖国，迅速改变着经济、文化的落后状态。从我国的基础来说，是“一穷二白”，但是六亿五千万人十三亿只手就是最大的“财富”，能够创造一切历史上没有过的奇迹，画出世界上最美丽的图画。现在，我们已经不再是赤手空拳了，我国已经拥有大量现代化的工业设备，成为世界上具有巨大的生产力的国家之一。艰苦、朴素、勤劳、勇敢的数亿人民一旦掌握了现代的科学技术，同最新式的机器结合起来，它的威力是不可估量的。我们可以满怀信心的说，我国的经济建设事业今后将以更快速的步伐向前发展。
    中华人民共和国建国十年以来的伟大成就，充分显示了社会主义的优越性，吸引着殖民地、半殖民地渴望获得自由解放的人民，这当然会使得帝国主义者感到极端的恐惧。美帝国主义及其仆从们在无法否认新中国日益繁荣富强的事实的时候，又散布出一种谎言，他们把中国人民为自己的幸福而劳动所表现出来的冲天干劲说成是什么“奴隶劳动”。如果说，只有为吸血的外国殖民者和本国的资本家、地主流血流汗才叫做“自由”的话，这样的“自由世界”在中国的确早已一去永远不复返了。周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的“政府工作报告”中说得好：“让西方资产阶级的老爷们叫嚷吧，我们的工人和农民除了失去了失业和挨饿的自由以外，什么也没有失掉。”
    同样的人民在同样的土地上为什么能够创造出前所未有的奇迹呢？关键就在于人民从前是奴隶，现在是主人。彻底解放了的中国人民，以主人翁的态度在自己的土地上从事和平的劳动，智慧和力量是无穷无尽的。我们今天在建设社会主义；明天还要建设共产主义，要把我们的伟大祖国建设成为人间的天堂。每一个爱国的中国公民，都以能够为这样一个崇高、伟大的事业而贡献自己的一分知识和力量感到无比的光荣和骄傲！
      “敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”，已成为任何力量所不能改变的历史规律了。帝国主义者叫骂也好，哭泣也好，都是不能阻止中国人民沿着社会主义道路胜利前进的！
    苏联和各兄弟国家以及全世界人民的支持和援助，使得我们的胜利能够不断地巩固和发展；我们的成就也加强和巩固了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，支援了世界人民争取自由解放，争取和平民主的斗争
    中国人民革命的胜利和建国以来所取得的伟大成就，同全世界劳动人民对我们的同情和支持是分不开的。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中就教导我们：“在帝国主义存在的时代，任何国家的真正的人民革命，如果没有国际革命力量在各种不同方式上的援助，要取得自己的胜利是不可能的。胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。”同时强调地指出：“我们在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义战线一方面去找。”十年来的历史事实，完全证明了毛主席的英明论断。
    苏联、社会主义兄弟各国以及世界广大人民所给予我们的支持和援助，使得我们的胜利能够不断地巩固和发展；同时我们的成就也直接间接加强和巩固了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，支援了世界人民争取自由解放、争取和平民主的斗争。我国已成为促进人类进步事业、保卫世界和平的一支重要力量，在国际事务中越来越居于重要的地位。我国是和平共处的五项原则的创始者之一，是万隆原则的签字国家，我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动和人民民主运动，同许多民族主义国家建立了贸易和经济联系。我国政府坚持和平外交政策，对和平事业作出了重大的贡献，获得了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的欢迎。
    随着时间的向前，人们越来越清楚地认识了中华人民共和国诞生的伟大历史意义和国际意义。全世界广大人民同我们一道欢呼中华人民共和国成立十周年，祝贺我国日益繁荣和昌盛。在这伟大的节日里，我们十分感谢从各方面支持我们的朋友，同时十分藐视那些用尽一切卑鄙手段妄图破坏我们的正义事业的敌人！
    在这欢欣鼓舞的日子里，我们对于苦难中的台湾同胞寄以无限的关怀。伟大的中国人民一定要解放自己的神圣领土台湾，使台湾同胞早日回到祖国怀抱，与我们共享社会主义的繁荣和幸福。美帝国主义想赖在台湾不走是不行的，我们解放台湾的正义斗争一定胜利！
    我们民主党派的成员十年来在共产党的教育和帮助下，一般都或多或少的为社会主义革命和社会主义建设做了一点事，我们要在今后作出更多的贡献，就必须继续在共产党的领导下，在社会主义工作岗位上，不断地通过实践和学习来加强自我改造，为伟大的社会主义事业服务，是我们无上的光荣，无比的骄傲！
    让我们同声欢呼：
        伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
        伟大的中国各族人民大团结万岁！
        伟大的中国共产党万岁！
        中国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
