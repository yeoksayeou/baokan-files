    Improve Quyi Art, Serve Socialist Construction
    陶钝
    Quyi is China's art of storytelling and ballad singing, with a long history and rich heritage. In the old society, it was a source of historical and social knowledge for the masses. There are more than 260 types of Quyi and over 50,000 professional Quyi performers nationwide. Each province, city, autonomous region, and ethnic group has its own type of Quyi, especially the northern regions of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan in the southwest, and Suzhou and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, which are all developed areas for Quyi.
    During the reigns of feudal dynasties, the Japanese invaders, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Quyi was not regarded as an art form. Quyi performers had a low social status, lived in hardship, and endured insults and oppression from the reactionary rulers for a long time. The reactionary rulers also used Quyi to promote feudal morality, reactionary ideas, and fatalism to maintain their rule. Many Quyi performers were filled with hatred for the reactionary rulers and the old society. They constantly used Quyi, this artistic weapon, to mock and denounce the rulers, expressing their resistance.
    Our Party has always attached importance to Quyi art. As early as in Yan'an, we vigorously promoted storytelling and ballad singing. The "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" policy proposed by the Party since the founding of the People's Republic of China has further promoted the development of Quyi. The masses call Quyi the "vanguard" and "light weapon" on the literary and art front, based on its characteristics of being "simple yet expressive, and extremely convenient for quickly reflecting reality." Over the past ten years, Quyi workers have achieved remarkable results in collecting and sorting out Quyi heritage, creating Quyi works with modern themes, and transforming the thinking of Quyi performers.
    Enlightening the political consciousness of performers and improving their performance environment and living conditions are inseparable from improving Quyi art. In the past, Quyi performers belonged to the lower strata of society, were despised by society, and endured direct oppression and bullying from local bullies, ruffians, and bad elements. Since liberation, China has thoroughly completed the democratic revolution. The local bullies, ruffians, and bad elements who used to ride on the backs of the working people in the old society have been duly punished, and Quyi performers have also raised their heads, participated in various political movements, and participated in cultural and political studies. Their political consciousness has been raised. They have established their own organizations, which is fundamentally different from their past life of being helpless and without support.
    In the past, the performance venues for Quyi did not provide shelter from the wind and rain. Sometimes they could not find housing and had to perform in the open air. One performance was not enough to support their families. Over the past ten years, this performance environment and living situation has changed dramatically. New Quyi halls have been built and old gardens have been renovated in various cities. The equipment in the venues is comfortable. The audience is no longer the few people of the past. Workers, peasants, merchants, students, soldiers, women, and young people are willing to go to Quyi venues to listen to a few sections of Quyi storytelling and ballad singing after work to relieve fatigue and make their spirits happy. Due to the improvement of venues and the expansion of the audience, the income of Quyi performers has greatly increased, and the living conditions of performers have generally improved. In the past, Quyi performers relied entirely on oral transmission for storytelling and singing, and most of them were illiterate. After cultural studies, all young and most middle-aged performers are no longer illiterate, but can read scripts and newspapers.
    In the old society, Quyi performers rarely participated in political activities. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, only a very small number of Quyi performers participated. The vast majority of performers lived a life of humiliation and forbearance in the cities. After liberation, Quyi performers rushed to participate in political activities. The Kuaiban performer Li Runjie composed Kuaiban praising the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army as soon as Tianjin was liberated and performed it along the streets. During the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, many performers participated in consolation performances. Crosstalk actor Chang Baokun and Qin player Cheng Shutang gloriously gave their lives. In the anti-Rightist struggle, Ye Yingmei, a blind artist from Zhejiang, was not afraid of the threats of reactionary elements and publicized everywhere. Quyi performers played the role of "vanguard" in every political movement, and participated in every one, playing a role in propaganda and mobilization. Now there are Party and League organizations in Quyi groups, and under the direct leadership of the Party, Quyi art has been rapidly developed. In particular, Crosstalk, Kuai Shu, and Kuaiban, which used to be performed in a corner of the market or on the side of the street, with only a small number of people listening. Now, Crosstalk, Kuai Shu, and Kuaiban have been widely loved by the masses, regardless of men, women, old, young, cadres, and the masses. Even many people have participated in creation and performance. These works include praise and satire, directly cooperating with political movements. Quyi performers consciously shoulder the glorious task of the socialist construction propaganda team. In order to complete this glorious task, they have made unremitting efforts in all aspects of improving Quyi art.
    In terms of collecting and sorting out traditional Quyi works, the former Chinese Quyi Research Association, local Quyi authors, and performers have conducted extensive work. The first priority was to rescue Quyi works preserved by the old artists. Tianjin recorded Chen Shihe's "Liaozhai Ping Shu," and the former Chinese Quyi Research Association recorded Wang Jiekui's "Bao Gong An." Although the work could not be completed because the old artists were old and weak and died one after another, some of it was still rescued. Nanjing recorded Wang Shaotang's "Shuihu Pinghua" with about five million words. Among them, "Wu Song Zhuan" with about one and a half million words, has been sorted out by the Yangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and will be published before the National Day this year. Various regions are collecting and excavating both short and long storytelling and singing, and some have been sorted out according to the principle of "removing its feudal dross and absorbing its democratic essence," so that artists can continue to tell stories and sing, to meet the cultural and entertainment needs of the masses. In particular, after Quyi artists have received socialist education and under the suggestions of the audience, they have deleted vulgar, obscene, and superstitious parts. The works that are often told and sung in the bookstores have gradually been purified.
    There have also been incorrect tendencies in collecting and sorting out traditional Quyi works. Some people believe that there are not many excellent traditional Quyi works in the first place, and after ten years of collection, they have been exhausted, and there will be no more gains from continuing to collect. In sorting out traditional works, instead of maintaining the excellent characteristics of traditional works and processing them on the basis of traditional works, they arbitrarily delete and arbitrarily tamper with them, making the traditional works completely unrecognizable. This kind of collection and sorting is obviously a contemptuous and rude attitude. They do not understand that traditional Quyi has a thick accumulation, and after the devastation of the enemy and the Kuomintang rule, most of it has been lost. What is preserved in the artists and the masses must still have valuable things, and continued collection will inevitably lead to new gains. The principle of sorting out traditional works is to weed through the old to bring forth the new, not to replace the old with the new; to remove the dross and preserve the essence; to focus on the traditional works themselves, and not to arbitrarily transform the traditional works according to the subjective intentions of the organizers. The tendency of neglecting and rudely treating traditional works exists now. Another tendency in sorting out traditional Quyi works is conservatism. In order to prefer the form and skills of traditional works, even if the content is poisonous, they are reluctant to delete it, believing that losing a little bit will damage the beauty of the traditional works. For example, the rotten "templates" and outdated vocabulary are still not changed, and even continue to be used when creating works with modern content, which cannot help but make these works lack a fresh breath.
    Over the past ten years, Quyi creation has also developed greatly. Whenever a major political movement arrives, works reflecting this movement appear. Especially after the rectification and anti-Rightist movement in 1958, the national leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the upsurge in science and technology and cultural revolution, coupled with the promotion of the National Congress of Quyi Workers and the National Quyi Performance, Quyi creation showed a booming phenomenon. According to incomplete statistics from 78 provincial and municipal publications in 1958, more than 3,000 Quyi works were published. The Quyi works published in national newspapers, local pamphlets, as well as wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and big-character posters are even impossible to count. From the perspective of form, there are various forms such as drum lyrics, Quyi lyrics, Kuaiban, Kuai Shu, Crosstalk, and Ping Shu. From the perspective of content, they are all closely integrated with politics, writing about new people and new things, and some are based on historical stories and folk tales. From the perspective of authors, only a part of the authors of these works are literary and art workers and Quyi artists. Most of them are workers, soldiers, peasants, primary school teachers, and cadres of organs who love Quyi. They have worked and lived in factories, rural areas, troops, and organs for a long time. They are familiar with life and can use the Quyi form because they have listened to artists tell stories and sing in Quyi venues thousands of times, so they have also written some excellent works.
    Soon after the national liberation, some advanced Quyi authors wrote works praising the new society and opposing feudal superstitions, such as "Two Willingnesses" and "Wangjiapo" which wrote about the marriage problems of men and women in the old and new society; "Yiguandao" which exposed the reactionary Taoist gates. Then, during the economic recovery period, in order to satirize those who did not abide by traffic rules and operating procedures, Crosstalk "Night Journey" and "Flying Oil Pot" were created. These works played a due role in educating the masses and improving Quyi creation.
    During the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, many Quyi authors and artists went to the front line to express their condolences, experienced life, and wrote works opposing American imperialism, praising the heroes of the Volunteer Army, and promoting Sino-Korean friendship. "A Cart of Sorghum Rice" wrote about a Volunteer Army truck driver who encountered an American military vehicle while transporting sorghum rice to the front at night. He controlled the enemy vehicle and drove a cart of American soldiers to our army's position as prisoners. The work wrote about the wit and bravery of our army and the fatigue and embarrassment of the enemy. It became a popular repertoire loved by the masses. Other works such as Kuaiban "Soldier's Home" and Crosstalk "Counterattack" are all good works.
    As socialist construction began, agricultural cooperatives were established in rural areas, and socialist transformation of industry and commerce was carried out in cities. These struggles were quickly reflected in Quyi works. Shandong Kuai Shu "Three Changes of Spring Couplets" wrote about the production competition between a military-affiliated wealthy middle peasant who worked alone and a cooperative. In the first year, his income exceeded the cooperative because he had thick production capital and high production technology. His spring couplets wrote: "The young son joins the army to protect the country, and has repeatedly made great achievements on the front line; the old man works alone, and has won a great victory in the first year." In the second year, his production was equal to that of the cooperative. The upper line was not changed, and the lower line was changed to "The old man works alone, waiting for the coming year to show his prestige again." In the third year, he suffered from insect pests and he was also ill. If the community had not defeated the insect pests and helped him, his family would not have seen a grain of grain. Only then did he believe in the superiority of the cooperative. The next sentence of his spring couplet was changed to "The old man helps each other and cooperates, and his thinking has been opened up in the third year." This work not only wrote about the superiority of the cooperative, but also wrote about the changes in the thinking of an old farmer in the process of the cooperative's development. It used the traditional skills of Quyi and wrote vividly, interestingly, and convincingly. In addition, "Lost Road Record" written in the form of Hubei Yugu was compiled with the story of Liu Jiemei who turned over and forgot her roots and turned back. The following two sections write about Liu Jiemei secretly watching the exhibition of the contrast between her new and old life by candlelight when it was quiet and unmanned at night:
    Pick up the broken bowl,
    See my mother's face,
    When will I eat a bowl of white rice,
    I'll be willing to die.
    Pick up the broken dung basket,
    Think of the threshing floor,
    Exhausted and hungry,
    No grain. This work was performed at the 1958 Quyi Performance and won the praise of many audiences.
    Han Qixiang also wrote and sang his own story "Turning Over Record" using Shaanbei storytelling to compare the new and old society. In order to refute the rightists' lies of "the present is not as good as the past," he accused the suffering he suffered in the old society; he also used the heart of blossoming flowers to sing the Party and Chairman Mao's care for him. At the beginning, he sang: "Play the Sanxian to refute the rightists, and I will sing my life to everyone." His performance was full of sincerity and emotion, which moved many viewers and shed tears of sympathy for him.
    Since the international situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the leap forward of China's socialist construction began, and Quyi creation also leaped forward with it. The Soviet artificial satellite went to the sky one after another, and the Sichuan car lamp artists took the lead in singing "Artificial Satellite Havoc in Heaven." However, since "Artificial Satellite Havoc in Heaven" appeared, Quyi authors continued to write works such as "Turning Rivers and Overturning Seas" and "Dragon King Resigns." Of course, it is powerful in reflecting the opening of mountains and diverting rivers and human power overcoming nature, but repeated imitation creates a trend, which is not good. The main thing is to face reality, write about the soaring energy, write about striving for the top, and write about the new people and new things in the great leap forward. Regarding this aspect, in the lyrics, there appeared the soaring energy of the masses accumulating fertilizer, and there also appeared "Moonlit Night Swinging Mud Boat," which reflected the leadership grasping production while grasping life, and "Let Fertilizer" which reflected the idea of ​​the whole country as one game.
    In terms of Crosstalk creation, good works have also continued to appear since the Great Leap Forward. Such as "Socialism is Good" which sings the Great Leap Forward, "Heroic Little Eighth Route Army" which sings the people on the Fujian front line, and "Sailor Breaks Superstition" which satirizes the dogmatists who only rely on books and do not rely on the masses, are all produced in the Great Leap Forward. In order to present gifts for the National Day this year, the Crosstalk program "Yesterday" in the Second Literary and Art Performance of the People's Liberation Army, wrote about a rickshaw driver who was oppressed by life and the ruling class on the eve of liberation, went to a mental hospital after liberation, and was cured after ten years. When he opened his eyes, the scene was completely different. His thoughts before the illness and today's society are full of contradictions and jokes. This Crosstalk took such a theme and technique to write about the comparison between the new and old societies, which is unique.
    The Great Leap Forward has also opened up a broad road for Ping Shu, which reflects the content of modern life. Ping Shu, which is more complex in form and more difficult to create, has also produced good works such as "Little Technician Overcomes Immortal Hands." This Ping Shu vividly depicts how the fairy hand who has experience in farming is conquered by the small technician who dares to think and dare to do in wheat production because of his conservative thinking. After this work was published, short Ping Shu such as "Digging Bricks" and "Brothers' Arena" which wrote about socialist large-scale collaboration were also continuously written. The Ping Shu, which developed later in creation, also became active. At the same time, Comrade Liu Liu tried to write a long Ping Shu with modern content. The novel "Fiery Steel," which takes the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War in the Hebei-Central Plains as the theme, has been adopted and performed by Ping Shu actors. The Pingtan workers in Shanghai created many middle chapters in the form of Pingtan with storytelling and singing, such as "Wang Xiaohe," "Be Sure to Repair the Huai River," and "Wang Chonglun," with an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, which has a great educational effect on the workers and masses. In the case that long Ping Shu is difficult to write for a while, and it is not necessarily possible to perform it after it is written, Ping Shu actors adapted the long novels "Railway Guerrilla," "Lin Hai Snow Field," and "Wildfire Spring Wind Fighting Ancient City" into Ping Shu and performed them, which also achieved good results. This aspect should continue to be promoted in the future.
    The creation of Quyi works is for storytelling and singing, and Quyi works can only meet the masses through storytelling and singing. Therefore, the improvement and development of Quyi performing arts is inseparable from creation. The performing arts of traditional Quyi have also preserved a rich heritage in the old artists. At the same time, because of singing in the city, it has also been infected with formalism or unhealthy things for a long time. Therefore, removing formalistic and unhealthy performances, preserving and promoting the original performance style of Quyi that is simple and pure can improve Quyi art by one step. For example, regardless of the content, Jingyun Dagu, Meihua Dagu, and Lihao Dagu only use the old set of tunes as usual, and have new lives after reform. Furthermore, the style of accompaniment that does not obey the requirements of singing and acts independently has also changed. Other such as disregarding the characteristics of Quyi storytelling and singing that one person represents several people or thousands of people, to learn the performance actions of drama, which does not conform to the performance law of Quyi, is laborious and unrewarding, and after a period of experimentation, it has gradually decreased.
    In the case that Quyi artists are generally organized and Quyi creation is generally carried out, the issue of improving Quyi art should be raised. Quyi creation has achieved great success in closely cooperating with realistic struggles, and it should still pay attention to cooperating with political movements in the future, which cannot be shaken. However, we should also see that although many works in the past have played a temporary role, most of them cannot be used after the event, and only a very few repertoires remain. The artists still feel that there are too few usable programs. Therefore, we must also pay attention to the artistic quality of the works at the same time. Another shortcoming is that the themes are relatively narrow. The works that write about Xiang Xiuli's deeds appeared one after another, while other characters who have the same communist moral qualities as Xiang Xiuli have not yet been written into Quyi works. When writing about production and fighting, only a few cutting-edge examples and characters are written, and many advanced things have not been written out. As for historical stories, revolutionary stories, and folk tales, there are even fewer. There is still a naturalistic tendency in the creation method. Just write what you see and what you have; do not trim, do not melt, and do not know the essence and find the typical. On the contrary, for the aspects that should be carefully crafted, they do not analyze, portray, and study. The story is not tense, and the characters are not vivid. This naturalistic tendency is relatively common. There are also storytelling and singing works that do not conform to the rules of storytelling and singing, so they cannot be sung smoothly, making the works stay on the books and cannot meet the vast audience through storytelling and singing, which is also a shortcoming that needs to be overcome.
    In terms of Crosstalk creation, many works of praise have appeared. Today is the new era led by the Party and Chairman Mao. The authors live in this era and feel happy and encouraged. It is completely reasonable to write works to praise, and it should be affirmed. However, in today's China, imperialism still exists around us, and the remnants of the bourgeoisie are still eroding people's minds. It is still urgently needed to expose the enemy. The shortcomings within the people must also be criticized. We create good works of criticism, satire, and exposure based on the characteristics of Crosstalk. What needs to be paid attention to here is to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and stand firm.
    In order to improve Quyi art, it is necessary to implement the policy of walking on two legs: on the one hand, learn from traditional Quyi by sorting out traditional Quyi, and on the other hand, create works with modern themes. Now the book lyrics and lyrics that the old artists and middle-aged artists can tell and sing have not been recorded, and the lost Quyi scripts have not been fully collected. It should continue to be recorded and sorted out to inherit the essence of traditional Quyi art. So that new works can inherit the essence of traditional works.
    In order to improve Quyi art, it is necessary to continue to popularize and continue to improve. There are now a large number of amateur Quyi authors and amateur actors among the masses, and their artistic level needs to be improved. The broad masses of peasants love Quyi, and there are still very few Quyi activities in rural areas. It should be developed to rural areas, and at the same time improve the amateur creation and performance among workers and soldiers. In addition to the apprentices of Quyi teams and the establishment of study classes, amateur actors may be a reserve army for Quyi.
    After liberation, Quyi artists have been separated from the position of being oppressed and bullied, and have become literary and art workers respected by the masses. Quyi art has been changed from the situation of "not being in the hall of elegance" to an indispensable part of the cultural and entertainment life of the people across the country. This is a great victory for the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." In the future, continue to implement the Party's literary and art policy, adhere to walking on two legs, Quyi will have greater development and prosperity. Quyi workers must continue to work hard and strive to be a qualified socialist propagandist.

专栏：辉煌的十年

    提高曲艺艺术，为社会主义建设服务
    陶钝
    曲艺是我国的说唱艺术，有悠久的历史，丰富的遗产，是旧社会群众获得历史知识和社会知识的一个来源。全国有二百六十多个曲种，五万以上的曲艺职业艺人。各省、市、自治区，各民族都有自己的曲种，特别是北方的冀、鲁、豫，西南的四川，江苏的苏州和扬州都是曲艺发达的地区。
    在封建皇朝、日寇和国民党反动派统治时期，曲艺不被当作艺术看待，曲艺艺人的社会地位很低，生活很苦，长期地忍受着反动统治者的侮辱和压迫。反动统治者还利用曲艺来宣传封建道德、反动思想和宿命论，以维护他们的统治。许多曲艺艺人对反动统治者和旧社会也充满了憎恨，时刻地通过曲艺这一艺术武器，对统治者嘻笑怒骂，表现他们的反抗。
    我们党一向重视曲艺艺术，早在延安的时候，已经大力提倡说唱艺术了。中华人民共和国开国以来党所提出的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的戏曲方针，进一步推动了曲艺的发展。群众根据曲艺“单纯而富于表现力，极便于迅速反映现实”这一特点，称曲艺为文艺阵线上的“尖兵”、“轻武器”。十年来曲艺工作者，对搜集整理曲艺遣产，创作现代题材的曲艺作品，改造曲艺艺人的思想，获得了显著的成绩。
    启发艺人的政治觉悟，改善艺人的演出环境和生活是和提高曲艺艺术分不开的。过去曲艺艺人属于社会的下层，被社会所轻视，忍受着恶霸、地痞和坏分子的直接压迫和欺侮。解放以后我国彻底完成了民主革命，向来在旧社会骑在劳动人民身上的恶霸、地痞和坏分子受到了应有的惩处，曲艺艺人也抬起头来，参加了历次政治运动，参加了文化和政治的学习。他们的政治觉悟提高了，成立了自己的团体，和过去无依无靠的生活根本不同了。
    过去曲艺的演出场所不蔽风雨。有时找不到房舍，只好露天演出。说唱一场，所得不够养活自己一家。十年来这种演出环境和生活情况大大地改变了。现在各城市都修建了新的曲艺厅，改造了旧园子。场内设备舒适了。观众已不再是旧日的少数人。工农商学兵、妇女、青年都愿意在劳动之余到曲艺场所听两段曲艺说唱，解除疲劳，使自己的精神愉快。由于场所改进，观众面扩大，曲艺艺人的收入大大地提高，艺人的生活普遍改善了。过去曲艺艺人说书唱曲全凭口授，艺人大多数是文盲。经过文化学习，所有的青年和大多数中年艺人，已经不再是文盲，而能读脚本，能看报刊了。
    在旧社会曲艺艺人很少参加政治活动。抗日战争和解放战争，只有极少数的曲艺艺人参加，绝大多数艺人是在城市过着含垢忍辱的生活。解放以后，曲艺艺人争先恐后地参加政治活动。快板艺人李润杰，在天津刚解放时就编出了歌颂共产党和解放军的快板，沿街演唱。在伟大的抗美援朝战争中，不少艺人参加了慰问演出工作。相声演员常宝坤、琴师程树棠光荣地献出了自己的生命。在反右斗争中，浙江盲艺人叶英美，不怕反动分子的威胁，到处宣传。曲艺艺人在每次政治运动中，发挥了“尖兵”的作用，没有一次不参加，没有一次不起了宣传鼓动的作用。现在曲艺团体中已经有了党、团的组织，在党的直接领导下，曲艺艺术得到迅速的发展。特别是相声和快书、快板，过去演出是在市场的一角或街道的一边，听众只有少数群众。现在，相声和快书、快板，得到了群众的广泛的喜爱，不分男女老少，干部和群众。甚至还有不少人参加了创作，参加了演唱。这些作品中有歌颂、有讽刺，直接配合了政治运动。曲艺艺人自觉地负担了社会主义建设宣传队的光荣的任务。为了完成这光荣的任务，在提高曲艺艺术的各方面作了不懈的努力。
    在搜集整理传统曲艺作品方面，前中国曲艺研究会、各地曲艺作者和艺人广泛地进行了工作。首先是抢救保存在老艺人身上的曲艺作品。天津市记录陈士和的“聊斋评书”，前中国曲艺研究会记录王杰奎的“包公案”。虽然因为老艺人年老力衰，相继去世，工作未能完成，也还抢救了一部分。南京市记录王少堂的“水浒评话”约五百万字。其中“武松传”约一百五十万字，经扬州市文化局进行整理，将在今年国庆前出版。各地对于短篇和长篇说唱都在进行搜集发掘，有的已经按照“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华”这一方针进行了整理，使艺人继续说唱，作为满足群众文化娱乐之用。特别是曲艺艺人在受到了社会主义的教育之后，在听众建议之下，对于低级庸俗、色情、迷信的部分都加以删除。现在书场中经常说唱的作品已逐步净化了。
    在搜集整理传统曲艺作品方面，也还出现了不正确的倾向。有的人以为优秀的传统曲艺作品本来就不多，经过十年来的搜集已经网罗殆尽了，再继续搜集也不会有更多的收获。他们在整理传统作品方面，不是保持传统作品的优美的特点，在传统作品基础上加工；而是任意删节、任意窜改，使传统作品的面目全非。这种搜集整理显然是一种轻视和粗暴的态度。他们不了解传统曲艺积蓄很厚，经过敌伪和国民党统治的摧残，大半散失，保存在艺人身上和群众手中的定然还有宝贵的东西，继续搜集必然会有新的收获。整理传统作品的原则是推陈出新，不是以新代旧；是去糟粕，存精华；是以传统作品本身为主，不能根据整理者的主观意图任意地改造传统作品。现在对传统作品的轻视粗暴的倾向是存在的。整理传统曲艺作品的另一种倾向是保守。为了偏爱传统作品的形式和技巧，即使内容有毒素也舍不得删除，认为去了一点就损失了传统作品的优美。例如用烂了的“套子”，陈旧的词汇，依然不动，甚至在创作现代内容的作品时还继续沿用，这样就不能不使这些作品缺乏新鲜的气息。
    十年来曲艺创作也有很大的发展。每当一次重大的政治运动到来，就出现反映这一运动的作品。特别是1958年整风反右之后，全国工农业生产大跃进，科学技术和文化革命高涨，加上全国第一次曲艺工作者代表大会和全国曲艺会演的推动，曲艺创作呈现了蓬勃发展的现象。根据1958年七十八种省、市刊物的不完全的统计，共发表了三千多篇曲艺作品。全国各报纸，各地出版的小册子以及墙报、黑板报、大字报所发表的曲艺作品更是没法统计。从形式上看，鼓词、曲词、快板、快书、相声、评书各种形式都有。从内容上看，都是密切结合政治，写了新人新事，也有的是取材历史故事和民间故事的。从作者来看，这些作品的作者，只有一部分是文艺工作者和曲艺艺人。大多数是爱好曲艺的工人、战士、农民、小学教师和机关干部，他们在工厂、农村、部队、机关里长期工作和生活，对于生活是熟悉的，他们又在曲艺场所千百遍地听艺人说唱，曲艺形式是能够使用的，因此也写出了一些优美作品。
    全国解放不久就有一些先进的曲艺作者，写出歌颂新社会，反对封建迷信的作品，例如写新旧社会男女婚姻问题的“两情愿”、“王家坡”等；揭露反动道会门的“一贯道”等。接着在经济恢复时期，为了讽刺不守交通规则，不遵守操作规程，创作了相声“夜行记”和“飞油壶”等。这些作品在教育群众和提高曲艺创作方面都起了应有的作用。
    抗美援朝运动中很多曲艺作者和艺人到前线慰问，体验了生活，写出了反对美帝国主义、歌颂志愿军英雄和中朝友谊的作品。“一车高粱米”写志愿军汽车司机夜里向前方运高粱米遇上了美军的汽车，他控制了敌车，把一车美军开到我军阵地作了俘虏。作品中写出了我军的机智勇敢，敌人的疲惫狼狈。成为群众喜爱的保留节目。其他如快板“战士之家”，相声“反击战”等都是好作品。
    社会主义建设开始，农村里建立起农业合作社，城市里进行了工商业社会主义改造。这些斗争迅速地反映到曲艺作品中来。山东快书“三换春联”写一个军属富裕中农单干和合作社的生产竞赛。第一年由于他生产资本厚，生产技术高，收入超过了合作社。他的春联上写道：“小儿参军保国，在前线屡建奇功；老汉单枪匹马，第一年大获全胜”。第二年他的生产和合作社平了，上联不改，下联改成“老汉单枪匹马，等来年再显威风”。第三年遭了虫灾，他又病了，若不是社里战胜虫灾又帮助了他，他家会一粒粮食不见的。他这才相信了合作社的优越性，他的春联，下一句改成了“老汉互助合作，第三年思想打通”。这作品不仅写出了合作社的优越性，并且写出了合作社发展的过程在一个老农民思想上引起的变化，运用了曲艺的传统技巧，写得生动有趣，有说服力。另外用湖北渔鼓形式写的“迷路记”，是用刘介梅翻身忘本又回头的故事编写的。下边这两节是写刘介梅在夜静无人时秉烛偷看自己生活的新旧对比展览会的：
    拿起打碎的碗，
    看见娘的脸，
    哪年吃上顿白米饭，
    死了也心甘。
    拿起破粪筐，
    想起打谷场，
    累断筋骨饿断肠，
    没得一颗粮。这个作品在1958年曲艺会演时演唱，博得很多听众的赞赏。
    写新旧社会对比的还有韩起祥用陕北说书自编自唱的自身故事“翻身记”。他为了驳斥右派“今不如昔”的谰言，控诉了在旧社会受的苦；也用了开花似的心情歌唱党和毛主席对他的关怀。一开头他就唱道：“弹起三弦驳右派，我把身世唱给大家听”。他的演唱充满了真情实感，激动了许多观众，为他洒了同情的热泪。
    自从国际形势东风压倒西风，我国的社会主义建设大跃进开始，曲艺创作也随之跃进了。苏联人造卫星接连着上了天，四川车灯艺人抢先唱出了“人造卫星大闹天宫”。但自从“人造卫星大闹天宫”出现了以后，曲艺作者继续写了“翻江倒海”、“龙王辞职”这类的作品。当然，在反映劈山开渠，人力战胜自然方面是有力量的，可是辗转摹仿，造成一种风气就不好了。主要的还是要面向现实，写冲天干劲，写力争上游，大跃进中的新人新事。关于这方面的内容，在唱词中，出现了写群众积肥的冲天干劲，还有反映领导上抓生产同时抓生活的“月夜荡泥船”，也出现了写全国一盘棋思想的“让化肥”。
    在相声创作方面从大跃进以后，好作品也连续出现。如歌颂大跃进的“社会主义好”、歌颂福建前线人民的“英雄小八路”、讽刺仅仅依靠书本、不依靠群众的教条主义者的“水兵破迷信”，都是大跃进中产生的。为了今年国庆献礼，解放军第二届文艺会演中相声节目“昨天”，写一个三轮车夫在解放前夕被生活和统治阶级压迫的疯了，解放后进了疯人院，十年才好，一睁眼光景全非。他以病前的思想和今天的社会接触，矛盾百出，笑料丛生。这相声写新旧对比采取了这样的题材和手法是别开生面的。
    大跃进也给反映现代生活内容的评书，开辟了广阔的道路。形式比较复杂、创作比较难的评书也出现了“小技术员战服神仙手”这样好的作品。这篇评书生动地描写了有种地经验的神仙手，因为思想保守在小麦生产上怎样被敢想敢干的小技术员所战服。这作品发表以后，写社会主义大协作的“挖砖记”和“兄弟擂台”等短篇评书也继续写出了。使创作发展较晚的评书也活跃起来了。同时刘流同志试写了长篇现代内容的评书，以冀中平原抗日游击战争为题材的小说“烈火金钢”，已经被评书演员采用上演了。上海的评弹工作者，以有说有唱的评弹形式创作了很多的中篇，如“王孝和”、“一定要把淮河修好”、“王崇伦”等，观众达几十万人次，对工人群众有很大的教育作用。在长篇评书一时难以写出、写出来了又不一定能上演的情况下，评书演员拿长篇小说“铁道游击队”、“林海雪原”、“野火春风斗古城”等改编为评书上演，也获得了很好的成绩。这方面今后还应当继续提倡。
    曲艺作品的创作是为了说唱，通过说唱曲艺作品才能和群众见面。所以曲艺表演艺术的改进和发展创作是分不开的。传统曲艺的表演艺术在老艺人身上也保留了丰富的遗产。同时因为在城市里演唱，日久也沾染上了形式主义、或不健康的东西。所以去掉形式主义的和不健康的表演，保存和发扬朴素纯洁的曲艺原来的表演作风，就能使曲艺艺术提高一步。例如，京韵大鼓、梅花大鼓、犁铧大鼓等演唱时不管内容如何，只是照例地运用老一套的腔调，经过改革后，有了新的生命。再如，伴奏不服从演唱的要求，各自为政的作风也改变了。其他如不顾曲艺说唱是一人代表几个人或千百人的说话的特点，要学习戏剧的表演动作，不符合曲艺的表演规律，费力而不讨好，试验一个时期之后，也逐渐的少了。
    在曲艺艺人普遍组织起来、曲艺创作普遍开展的情况下，曲艺艺术的提高问题是应该提出的。曲艺创作在密切配合现实斗争方面，获得了很大的成绩，今后仍然应该注意配合政治运动，那是不能动摇的。可是我们也应该看到过去好些作品虽曾起过一时的作用，但大半是事过景迁不能再用，只有极少数的保留节目，艺人仍然感到可用的节目太少。因此我们要同时注意作品的艺术质量。另一缺点是题材比较窄狭。写向秀丽的事迹的作品就连三接四的出现，而其他和向秀丽同样具有共产主义道德品质的人物还没有写入曲艺作品。写生产和战斗，只写了几个尖端的事例和人物，还有众多的先进事物没有写出来。至于历史故事，革命故事和民间故事，那就更少了。在创作方法上还存在着自然主义的倾向。只是见什么写什么，有什么写什么；不加剪裁，不加融化，源源本本，不知道摸本质，找典型。相反的对于应当精雕细刻的方面，又不加分析、刻划、研究。故事不紧张，人物不生动。这种自然主义倾向是比较普遍的。也有的说唱作品，不合说唱规律，所以唱起来不能上口，使作品停留在本本上，不能通过说唱和广大听众见面，这也是一个需要克服的缺点。
    在相声创作方面，出现了不少歌颂性的作品，今天是党和毛主席领导的新时代，作者生活在这时代里感到欢欣鼓舞，写作品来歌颂是完全合理的，应该加以肯定。但是在今天中国周围，帝国主义还存在，资产阶级残余还在腐蚀人民的思想，揭露敌人还是迫切需要的。人民内部的缺点也还是要批评的。我们根据相声的特点创作好的批评、讽刺和揭露的作品。这里需要注意的是分清敌我，站稳立场。
    为了提高曲艺艺术必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针：一方面通过整理传统曲艺，向传统曲艺学习，一方面创作现代题材的作品。现在老艺人和中年艺人所能说唱的书词唱词还没有记录完毕，散失的曲艺本子还没有完全收集。应该继续记录整理，把传统曲艺艺术继承下来。使新作品能继承传统作品的精华。
    为了提高曲艺艺术，还要继续普及，继续提高。现在群众中间有大批的曲艺业余作者和业余演员，他们的艺术水平需要提高。广大的农民是爱好曲艺的，农村的曲艺活动还很少，应当向农村发展，同时提高工人战士中的业余的创作和表演。除了曲艺团队的学徒和创办学习班以外，业余演员有的可能是曲艺的后备军。
    解放以后曲艺艺人已经脱离了被压迫受欺侮的地位，成为受群众尊重的文艺工作者了。曲艺艺术已经从“不登大雅之堂”的情况改变成全国人民文化娱乐生活中不可少的一部分了。这是党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”政策的伟大的胜利。今后继续贯彻党的文艺方针，坚持两条腿走路，曲艺将有更大的发展和繁荣。曲艺工作者要继续努力，争取作一个够格的社会主义宣传员。
