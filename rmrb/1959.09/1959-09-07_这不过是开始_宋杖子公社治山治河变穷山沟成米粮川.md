    This is Just the Beginning
    ——Songzhangzi Commune Transforms a Poor Mountain Valley into a Land of Rice and Grain Through Mountain and River Management
    The Chinese Communist Party, Liaoning Lingyuan County Committee
    The Songzhangzi Commune in Lingyuan County, Liaoning, utilizes its robust manpower and material resources to manage mountains and rivers, transforming barren mountains into forests and river valleys into farmland. The People's Commune has become a great force for the mountain people and the embodiment of happiness.
    The Songzhangzi Commune is a commune that focuses on agriculture and comprehensively develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. After collectivization, it has leveraged the superiority of the collective economy for several years, and grain production has risen in a straight line. In particular, during the Great Leap Forward of 1958, grain production reached 23.1 million jin, and the commune sold 7.15 million jin of surplus grain, an increase of 1.35 million jin compared to 1957. This not only improved the lives of commune members but also greatly supported the country's economic construction.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, the People's Commune emerged like a rising sun. The Songzhangzi Commune was also formed by the merger of four agricultural cooperatives with 5,069 households, resulting in a large workforce, abundant materials, and strong technical capabilities. To completely change the face of the impoverished mountainous area, a vigorous upsurge in mountain and river management and large-scale farmland water conservancy construction was launched from the winter of 1958 to the spring of 1959. Under the personal leadership of the Party Committee Secretary, the vast number of commune members joined the battle. The entire commune formed a water conservancy combat corps of more than 1,700 people. After a winter and spring of hard work, four river interception and diversion canal projects, stretching 12,000 meters, were completed; thirteen small reservoirs, storing 600,000 cubic meters of water, were built; fifteen deep wells and eight ordinary wells were dug. This enabled the garden-style cultivation of 3,290 mu of farmland and the water conservancy of 8,658 mu of land throughout the commune. These projects exceeded the total amount of water conservancy construction since liberation. At the same time, water conservancy machinery and equipment were added, including seven diesel engines and eight steam engines. Last winter and this spring, the water conservancy projects and mechanical equipment were fully utilized to irrigate 10,000 mu of land, ensuring the full emergence of spring planting seeds.
    The commune also fully leveraged the superiority of its large workforce to vigorously launch a deep plowing campaign. After rationally arranging overall work, the Party Committee mobilized more than 4,000 deep plowing troops in the autumn of 1958, deeply plowing more than 40,000 mu of land, accounting for more than 40% of the cultivated area. The commune purchased three tractors, deeply plowing 3,650 mu of land.
    Large-scale agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects, coupled with deep plowing, have laid a solid foundation for this year's bumper harvest. People looked at the tall, thick sorghum stalks and heavy ears of grain growing on the deeply plowed land, praising the power of the People's Commune and looking forward to a more prosperous and happy tomorrow.
    Mountains Draped in Green Gauze, Home巧巧打扮
    Dry seas become green seas, and bald mountains are draped in green gauze. These are the most significant changes in afforestation, especially after communization, in the ten years since liberation.
    This area was originally an impoverished mountainous region with many gullies and no water, and many mountains and no trees. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers here organized themselves and began planting trees and managing mountains and rivers. However, large-scale mountain and river management and afforestation began after communization. During the Great Leap Forward last year, in order to comprehensively manage mountains and rivers and plant trees, the commune Party Committee formulated an ambitious two-year greening plan. The commune Party Committee summarized its experience over the years, expanded and established five forestry teams, sixty forest protection groups, and twenty-one nurseries, with more than 220 professionals engaged in seedling cultivation and afforestation. The Party Committee also adopted a combination of specialized afforestation organizations and mass movements, seizing every opportunity and combining large and small campaigns: seizing the spring, autumn, and rainy seasons, Party members, Youth League members, and cadres throughout the commune led the masses, braving wind, snow, and severe cold, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, adopting the method of large-scale operations, with the momentum of thousands of troops and horses, holding high red flags, beating war drums, and launching a large-scale offensive against barren mountains and dry rivers. During the day, red flags fluttered on the mountains, and at night, lights illuminated the ground everywhere. The commune members' enthusiasm soared, and the scene was very moving. On the basis of planting 18 million trees and covering an area of 30,000 mu during the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Songzhangzi Commune planted 30 million trees, afforesting an area of 54,000 mu, managing six flower and fruit mountains, and digging 1.5 million fish-scale pits. This transformed the original barren mountains and bald ridges into a land of flowers and fruits.
    After the mountains and rivers were greened, water and soil loss was controlled, water sources were conserved, the climate was regulated, and a large amount of feed, green manure, and firewood was provided, directly supporting animal husbandry and agricultural production. This transformed the impoverished mountainous area, which used to have many bald mountains and few trees, into a place with green mountains and clear waters, shady trees, and prosperity.
    Many Cattle and Sheep in the Deep Willow Shade
    The animal husbandry of the Songzhangzi People's Commune has developed rapidly through a year of painstaking management last year. The number of cattle increased from 2,501 in 1957 to 2,901, horses and mules from 225 to 377, sheep from 15,723 to 17,563, pigs from 6,561 to 8,075, and donkeys reached 2,437, totaling nearly twice the number before liberation. This rapid increase in livestock of all sizes not only eliminated the heavy manual labor of carrying loads on shoulders that had existed throughout history, greatly liberating productivity, but also increased the commune's income. Moreover, it accumulated nearly 500 million jin of manure annually, laying a material foundation for increased agricultural production.
    As soon as people arrive at the Songzhangzi Commune, they will see herds of cattle and sheep running on the mountains. The herdsmen hold thick whips, constantly driving the sheep, echoing throughout the surrounding mountains. At this time, the commune members working at the foot of the mountain said to me: "It is true that the People's Commune has a large workforce and great strength. The establishment of a specialized animal husbandry team has only been for more than a year, and so many livestock have been developed. In a few years, perhaps everyone will drink milk and eat mutton every day." Indeed, recalling the scene of "lacking carts and donkeys and few draft animals, carrying loads on shoulders and people pulling plows" in those years, how can people not be excited in the face of these large herds of livestock?
    The reason why animal husbandry has proliferated so rapidly, with fat and fleshy animals, cattle and sheep all over the mountains, and herds of horses and mules, is mainly due to the expansion of the People's Commune's organization, its wide scope, which is conducive to the rational use of labor, and its suitability for unified leadership, division of labor, and specialization.
    In order to achieve high-speed development of animal husbandry in a short period of time, the commune Party Committee, in addition to the secretary taking the lead, established specialized organizations for breeding, improved breeding, and epidemic prevention, replacing the old and decentralized management methods with meticulous and scientific management methods, and replacing natural breeding with artificial insemination, so the number of livestock increased rapidly. The commune has a total of seven pig breeding farms, with 119 breeding pigs. Under the care of professional breeders, each sow produces eight piglets per year, with the most reaching fourteen, and a survival rate of over 90%. The commune allocates these piglets to teams and commune members for raising according to the situation. Now, the commune has breeding pig farms, the teams have fattening farms, and every household raises piglets. The commune has also established an animal husbandry epidemic prevention and treatment station. Under the guidance of 23 epidemic prevention and treatment technicians, more than 10,000 livestock in the entire commune are universally vaccinated. In the past year, not a single large animal has been lost. These living facts even make those who doubted whether the commune could be run well now have to praise: "There is an epidemic prevention station above, and animal husbandry workers below, injections and eye drops, health up to four full, only communization can do it, individual farming is really difficult." People have been discussing, "Without the People's Commune, let alone raising large herds of horses and long-wool sheep, even seeing them is a fantasy." In addition, in order to solve the feed problem, in addition to the commune collectively planting 250 mu of alfalfa and sweet clover, it also organizes each team to ensile feed grass, which allows various livestock to eat fresh and dry grass suitable for their taste in different seasons, growing fat and fleshy, and opening up broad avenues for the large-scale development of animal husbandry in the future.
    Great Changes in People's Lives
    Due to the straight-line increase in agricultural production and the great development of forestry and animal husbandry in the Songzhangzi People's Commune in recent years, the lives of the vast number of commune members have improved significantly. In particular, the changes in production and life have been even more significant since the development from advanced cooperatives to People's Communes.
    The total income of the entire commune was 479,329 yuan in 1956, 491,635 yuan in 1957, 700,407 yuan in 1958, and the estimated income for this year is 746,393 yuan. From the perspective of the actual income of commune members, the average income per person was 43.43 yuan in 1956, 67.63 yuan in 1958, and the estimated income for this year is 70.64 yuan. In 1956, among the 1,234 households in the Songzhangzi Production Brigade (formerly the Red May Cooperative), 600 households lacked food. In 1957, the number of households lacking food was basically eliminated. By 1958, after communization, all commune members received enough rations for their entire families, and 890 households received money. This means that they not only had no households lacking food, but also had a large number of households with surplus grain.
    As the lives of commune members have improved, their purchasing power has also greatly increased. Now, within the entire commune, there is one supply and marketing cooperative, five stores, and four distribution outlets. In the early days of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in 1950, the daily sales volume here was 350 yuan, in 1958 it was 900 yuan, and now the daily sales volume is 2,300 yuan. Looking at the sales of goods, a total of 274 pairs of rubber shoes, 27 thermos bottles, and 3,157 packs of cigarettes were sold in the first half of 1957, while in the first half of this year, the sales of rubber shoes reached 1,436 pairs, thermos bottles 434, and cigarettes 8,816 packs. Looking at the clothing, those young men and women are truly dressed neatly.
    The biggest change in the lives of commune members is in the cultural sphere. Now there are 35 primary schools, three middle schools, hundreds of teachers, 3,560 primary school students, and 235 middle school students. How can this be compared to the situation of primary and secondary schools before liberation or in the early days of liberation? In addition, now every team has night schools, cultural troupes, clubs, health clinics, nurseries, canteens, and maternity hospitals. The commune has also installed electric lights and established a broadcasting station, installing more than 500 loudspeakers. In this remote mountain valley, every evening after dinner, the laboring peasants who have suffered oppression for thousands of years sit under bright electric lights and hear the melodious songs coming from Beijing, how can this not be exciting?
    The changes in the lives of the farmers here in the ten years since liberation, especially in the year after communization, have been tremendous, but these changes are only the beginning of a beautiful socialist life. The vast number of commune members here are working with soaring enthusiasm, fighting hard in September, presenting gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, and advancing towards a bright future!

    这不过是开始
    ——宋杖子公社治山治河变穷山沟成米粮川
    中共辽宁凌源县委员会
    辽宁凌源县宋杖子公社以雄厚的人力物力治山治河，变荒山为树林，改河套为农田。人民公社成为山区人民的巨大力量和幸福的化身。
    宋杖子公社是一个以农业为主，农林牧副全面发展的公社。合作化后，几年来发挥了集体经济的优越性，粮食产量直线上升。特别是1958年的大跃进，粮食产量达到二千三百一十万斤，全社出卖余粮七百十五万斤，较1957年多卖一百三十五万斤。不但提高了社员生活，还大大支援了国家经济建设。
    在去年大跃进中，人民公社像初升的太阳一样出现了。宋杖子公社也由四个农业社五千零六十九户合并而成，人多力量大，物资和技术力量更雄厚了。为了彻底改变贫困山区的面貌，从1958年冬到1959年春掀起了轰轰烈烈治山治河、大兴农田水利高潮。在党委书记亲自带领之下，广大社员都投入了战斗。全公社组成一千七百多人的水利战斗兵团，经过一冬一春苦战，截河引渠工程四条，长达一万二千米；小型水库十三座，蓄水六十万立方米；打深井十五眼，普通井八眼。这就使全公社三千二百九十亩耕地实现了园田化，八千六百五十八亩地实现了水利化。这些工程超过了解放以来兴修水利的总和。同时增添了水利机械设备，购买柴油机七台、驼锅机八台。在去冬今春，充分利用水利工程和机械设备，灌地一万亩，保证了春播种子出全苗。
    公社又充分发挥人多力大的优越性，轰轰烈烈地开展了深翻地运动。党委在合理安排了全面工作后，1958年秋天调动四千多名深翻地大军，深翻土地四万余亩，占耕地面积40％强；公社购进三台拖拉机，深翻地达三千六百五十亩。
    大兴农林水利，大搞深翻地，给今年丰收奠定了坚实的基础。人们望着在深翻土地上长着的秸粗穗大的高粱和沉甸甸的谷穗，赞美着人民公社的力量，向往着更加幸福生活的明天。
    高山披绿纱  家乡巧打扮
    旱海成绿海，秃山披绿纱，这是解放十年来，特别是公社化后，在封山育林上最巨大的变化。
    这里原来是沟多无水、山多无树的贫困山区。解放后，在党的领导下，这里农民组织起来，开始植树造林，治山治河。但大规模的治山治河、植树造林，是从公社化后开始的。在去年大跃进的日子里，公社党委为了全面地治山治河，植树造林，制定了二年绿化的宏伟计划。公社党委总结了几年来的经验，扩大建立了五个林业队，六十个护林组，二十一个苗圃，从事育苗造林的专业人员达到二百二十多人。党委又采取造林专业组织与群众运动相结合，见缝插针，大运动套小运动的办法：抓紧春、秋和雨季，全公社党团员、干部带动广大群众，迎风雪，冒严寒，风餐露宿，采取大兵团作战的办法，以千军万马之势，高举红旗，猛击战鼓，向荒山干河大举进攻。白天山上红旗招展，夜晚遍地灯火通明，社员干劲冲天，景象十分动人。宋杖子公社在互助合作运动时植树一千八百万棵、面积三万亩基础上，植树三千万棵、造林面积达五万四千亩，治花果山六座，挖鱼鳞坑一百五十万个。使原来的荒山秃岭，变成花果之乡。
    山河绿化起来后，控制了水土流失，涵养了水源，调和了气候，并提供大批饲草、绿肥、烧柴，直接支援了畜牧和农业生产。使往日秃山多、林树少的贫困山区，变成了山清水秀，绿树成荫，繁荣富饶的地方。
    柳荫深处牛羊多
    宋杖子人民公社的畜牧业经过去年一年的苦心经营，得到了迅速发展。牛由1957年的二千五百零一头发展到二千九百零一头，骡马由二百二十五匹发展到三百七十七匹，羊由一万五千七百二十三只发展到一万七千五百六十三只，猪由六千五百六十一头发展到八千零七十五头，驴达到二千四百三十七头，总计比解放前增加了将近两倍。这些大小牲畜的激骤增长，不仅消灭了有史以来的人力担挑的笨重劳动，大大解放了生产力；并使公社增加了收入。而且每年积攒了近五亿斤粪肥，给农业增产奠定了物质基础。
    人们一到宋杖子公社，老远就会看到一群群牛羊在山上奔跑，放牧员手握着粗杆大鞭，不时地抽赶羊群，震荡着围山反响。这时，在山下劳动的社员对我说：“真是公社化了人多力量大，成立畜牧专业队才一年多，就发展了这么多的牲口。再过几年，说不定每人每天要喝上牛奶，吃上羊肉呢。”的确，回忆起当年那种“缺车无驴少耕畜，干活肩挑人拉犁”的情景，面对着这大群大群牲畜，怎能不使人兴奋呢？
    畜牧业之所以繁殖这样迅速，膘满肉肥，牛羊满山，骡马成群，主要是发挥了人民公社的组织扩大、范围宽广，既便于合理使用劳动力，又宜于实行统一领导、分工分业的巨大优越性。
    公社党委为在短期内使畜牧业达到高速度发展的目的，除书记挂帅外，分别成立了种畜繁殖、改良配种、防疫等专业组织，用细致科学的管理方法代替了陈旧的分散的经营方法，用人工交配代替了自然繁殖，因而牲畜数量增加很快。公社发展生猪的繁殖场共有七个，种猪一百十九口，在专业饲养员的喂养下，每头母猪每年繁殖八头，最多的达十四头，成活率达90％以上。公社把这些仔猪根据情况分别划给小队和社员去饲养。现在是社有种猪场，队有育肥场，家家户户把仔猪养。公社又建立了畜牧防疫治疗站，在二十三名防疫治疗技术员的指导下，全社一万多头牲畜普遍注射预防，一年来没有损失一头大牲畜。这些活生生的事实，就连那些怀疑公社是否能办好的人们现在也不得不称赞说：“上有防疫站，下有畜牧员，注射加点眼，健壮达四全，唯有公社化，单干真难办。”人们纷纷议论“若没有人民公社，别说养大群马、长绒羊，就连看看也是妄想。”此外，为了解决饲料问题，除公社集体种植苜蓿草、草木樨二百五十亩外，还组织各小队青贮饲草，这就可以使各种牲畜按不同季节吃到适合口味的鲜干草，长得膘肥肉满，并给今后大量发展畜牧业开拓了广阔道路。
    人民生活大改观
    宋杖子人民公社由于几年来农业生产直线上升，林业、畜牧业大发展，广大社员生活显著提高了。特别是从高级社发展到人民公社以后，生产和生活的变化更加显著。
    1956年全社总收入四十七万九千三百二十九元，1957年收入四十九万一千六百三十五元，1958年收入七十万零四百零七元，今年预计收入七十四万六千三百九十三元。从社员实际收入上看，1956年每人平均收入四十三元四角三分，1958年收入六十七元六角三分，今年预计收入七十元六角四分。在1956年，宋杖子生产大队（原红五月社）一千二百三十四户中，有六百户缺吃粮。1957年基本上消灭了缺粮户。到1958年公社化后，全社社员都分到了全家足够的口粮，并有八百九十户分到了钱。这就是说，他们不仅没有缺粮户，而且有大批余粮户了。
    社员生活上升了，购买力也大大提高了。现在全公社范围内，有一个供销社、五个商店、四个分销店。在互助合作运动初期的1950年，这里一天销售额三百五十元，到1958年是九百元，现在一天销售额就有二千三百元了。从销售商品看，在1957年上半年共销售胶鞋二百七十四双、暖水瓶二十七个、纸烟三千一百五十七条，到今年上半年胶鞋销售达一千四百三十六双、暖水瓶四百三十四个、纸烟八千八百十六条了。从穿着上看，那些年青的小伙子和姑娘们，真是穿得整整齐齐了。
    标志着社员生活最大变化的是在文化生活方面。现在这里有三十五所小学，三处中学，教师上百名，小学生三千五百六十名，中学生二百三十五人。这怎能与解放前或解放初期中小学的情况相比拟呢；另外，现在队队都有夜校、文工团、俱乐部，有卫生所、托儿所、食堂、妇产院。公社还安上了电灯，办起广播站，安装喇叭五百多个。在这偏僻小山沟里，每当晚饭后，几千年饱受压迫的劳动农民，坐在明亮的电灯底下，听到从北京传出的悠扬的歌声，怎不令人兴奋呢？
    解放十年来，特别是公社化后的一年，这里的农民生活变化是巨大的，但这些变化仅仅是美好的社会主义生活的开始。这里广大社员们，正以冲天的干劲，大战9月份，向国庆十周年献礼，向美好未来前进！
