Korean Labor Hero Choi Sung-soo Says
Firmly Believes the Chinese People Will Achieve Even Greater Success
    (Based on a report from newspapers in Pyongyang on the 2nd) Choi Sung-soo, a labor hero from the South District Construction Company of Pyongyang City, made a statement on the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, saying: He feels infinitely excited about the great victories achieved by the Chinese worker brothers in the Great Leap Forward movement. He said: The reason why the Chinese people have been able to achieve amazing and miraculous achievements is the result of effectively implementing the general line of the Chinese Communist Party in building socialism, launching the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement.
    He said: The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC called on the Chinese people to strive for new and great victories in the Great Leap Forward movement, and thoroughly smash the slanders and calumnies of reactionary factions at home and abroad, which is completely correct. He expressed his firm belief that the Chinese working class and the people will thoroughly smash right-leaning opportunist ideas, implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and achieve even greater success.
