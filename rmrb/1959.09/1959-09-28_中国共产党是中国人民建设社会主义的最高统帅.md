    The Chinese Communist Party is the Supreme Commander of the Chinese People in Building Socialism
    Liu Lantao, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee
    The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 opened a new era in our country's history, completely liberating hundreds of millions of exploited and oppressed working people from the evil rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. For the first time ever, they acquired ruling power nationwide, and the Chinese Communist Party became the sole revolutionary party leading the national regime. Over the past decade, our Party has gone through an infinitely glorious journey. The Party has led the people of the whole country to achieve the complete victory of the democratic revolution, followed by the decisive victory of the socialist revolution, and has also achieved brilliant achievements in socialist construction. The socialist system, which the Chinese people have longed for for many years, has been firmly established on our country's vast and rich land. This is a great victory of Marxism-Leninism in China and a great victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Over the past decade since the founding of the country, the organization of the Chinese Communist Party has grown unprecedentedly. The total number of party members has increased from 4.5 million in 1949 to 13.96 million now. The number of primary party organizations has grown from 250,000 in 1949 to 1.06 million now. Primary party organizations have been universally established in cities and villages, industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes, government agencies and schools, and companies of the People's Liberation Army; party organizations have also been established in all ethnic minority areas across the country. Over the past decade, our veteran cadres, who have been tempered by the flames of revolution for a long time, have quickly mastered various skills in building socialism. At the same time, millions of outstanding new cadres have been promoted and trained from among workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, who are shouldering glorious leadership responsibilities on all fronts of politics, economy, national defense, diplomacy, culture, education, science, and art. Over the past decade, the entire Party has undergone several party consolidation and rectification movements, conducting in-depth and systematic socialist and communist education, seriously criticizing the subjective, sectarian, and bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from reality and the masses, focusing on opposing bourgeois ideology that hinders and sabotages the socialist cause, and waging resolute struggles against all errors that violate the Party's line, principles, and policies. At the same time, tens of thousands of counter-revolutionaries, class dissidents, bourgeois rightists, serious lawbreakers, and other bad elements who had infiltrated the Party have been purged from our glorious Communist Party ranks. As a result, the Party's organization has been unprecedentedly purified and consolidated, and the communist consciousness of the vast number of party members has been greatly enhanced, bringing our Party's construction to a high level of Marxism-Leninism.

    In the long-term revolutionary struggle, our Party has established an inseparable relationship with the people of the whole country and enjoys a lofty prestige among the masses. Party leading cadres at all levels and the vast number of party members, whether in labor, combat, or various tasks, have shared weal and woe with the masses with a spirit of selfless devotion and selflessness. The people regard them as their confidants, good friends, and good comrades, as close as brothers and sisters. The people have learned from the long-term revolutionary struggle that the Chinese Communist Party is the party of the broad masses of working people and the sole representative of the interests of the Chinese people.

    The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, composed of the most progressive, outstanding, brave, and communist-conscious elements of the Chinese working class and laboring people, and is the highest form of class organization of the Chinese working class. To realize the great goal of socialism and communism in China is the sacred duty of us communists, and Marxism-Leninism is the guide to all our actions. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has adhered to the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, thus being able to truly understand the laws of social development and the laws of our country's revolutionary struggle, correctly grasp the development and changes in the revolutionary situation, promptly put forward new historical tasks, formulate correct political and organizational lines, and lead the people of the whole country from one revolutionary stage to another, from one victory to another. History has proved that the Chinese Communist Party is the greatest, most glorious, and most correct revolutionary party in our country's history, a politically fully mature Marxist-Leninist party, and only the Chinese Communist Party can assume the supreme command of the Chinese people in carrying out revolution and construction. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago that "no other political party (whether a bourgeois party or a petty-bourgeois party) can shoulder the responsibility of leading the two great revolutions of Chinese democratic revolution and Chinese socialist revolution to complete completion except the Chinese Communist Party." Therefore, unswervingly strengthening and consolidating the Party's leading role in all revolutionary struggles is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of our country's socialist cause.

    It is quite obvious that the question of whether or not to have the leadership of the Communist Party is the question of whether or not to have socialism, is a major issue concerning the fate of China, and is a fundamental issue in the struggle of "who will win" between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the capitalist road and the socialist road, in our country's transition period. Over the past decade, the revolutionary movements of the broad masses of our country, especially the experience of the struggle against the bourgeois rightists in 1957, have irrefutably confirmed this revolutionary truth. The main target of the bourgeois rightists' attack in 1957 was the Chinese Communist Party's leadership over China's socialist cause. However, after the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts nationwide, the Communist Party did not withdraw from "all positions" as the bourgeois rightists had dreamed of, but unprecedentedly strengthened the Party's leadership on all fronts; it was not the collapse of the proletarian dictatorship in our country, but the people's world under the proletarian dictatorship led by the Communist Party became stronger and more consolidated. The bourgeois rightists, as a result of competing with the Communist Party and the people, suffered a shameful and miserable defeat.

    At present, although our country's socialist revolution has achieved decisive victories on the economic, ideological, and political fronts, the class struggle has not ended. Imperialism still exists abroad, and classes still exist at home; the reactionary ideological and political activities of the urban and rural bourgeoisie still exist, and they will stir up trouble whenever they have the opportunity, trying to shake the foundation of the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist edifice. Therefore, the ideological and political struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is still long-term and complicated, developing in a wave-like manner with ups and downs, and sometimes it will be very sharp. This struggle will continue for decades until the class struggle is completely extinguished.

    The life-and-death struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat will inevitably be reflected within the Party. This is not surprising. The bourgeoisie's anti-socialist ideology always influences and corrodes our Party from all aspects, and imperialism and all reactionary forces at home and abroad always try every means to find their agents in our Party, carrying out sabotage from within the Party and from the core of the Party's leadership. And the wavering and unreliable elements in our Party are always easily influenced by them; the speculators, class dissidents, and individual careerists with a bourgeois world outlook who have infiltrated the Party will inevitably stand on the bourgeois position and attempt to transform the Party into an opportunist party according to the bourgeois world outlook and the bourgeois desires, in order to achieve their goal of usurping the leadership of the revolution. During the democratic revolution period, our Party had bourgeois agents in the Party such as Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao. During the socialist revolution period, some bourgeois revolutionaries and fellow travelers of Marxists who joined our Party during the democratic revolution period without any socialist revolutionary spirit preparation, when the private ownership of the means of production of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie is to be completely and thoroughly eliminated, their reactionary bourgeois ideology determines that they must resolutely resist, and they will inevitably echo the reactionary forces at home and abroad and carry out anti-Party activities. The Gao Gang-Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance was a bourgeois agent in the Party that adapted to the wishes of imperialists and bourgeois counter-revolutionaries. Now, some right-leaning opportunists oppose the Party's general line, oppose the Great Leap Forward, and oppose the people's communes. The essence of their attack on the Party is to represent the interests of the bourgeoisie and sabotage the socialist revolution and socialist construction. It is quite obvious that if their anti-Party activities are not completely crushed, the Party will not be able to defeat the resistance of the bourgeoisie, firmly grasp the leadership of the country, and lead the people of the whole country to achieve the victory of revolution and construction. The Marxist-Leninist party is a unified combat organization and must have strict organization and iron discipline. The unity and unification of the Party is the life of the Party. No opportunist factions are absolutely allowed to exist within the Party, and no remarks and actions that split the Party and usurp the Party are absolutely allowed. Sympathizing with and condoning these anti-Party activities, as well as any compromising and wavering performance in the serious struggle against anti-Party activities, regardless of their subjective wishes, are actually helping the bourgeoisie and opposing the proletariat.

    To ensure the unified leadership of the Party, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in all social fields, and guiding all revolutionary work according to the Marxist world outlook. Ideological work and political work are always the soul and commander of all our work. It must be understood that if the proletariat is not in command anywhere, the bourgeoisie will inevitably be in command; any place that abandons and ignores the Party's ideological work and political work will be divorced from the masses, lose its direction, and go astray. Some people firmly oppose putting politics in command, saying that ideological work and political work cannot produce grain or steel, and do not solve any practical problems. Their idea of completely separating the Party's political leadership from the practical work of the masses and completely separating politics from business is actually to weaken and even fundamentally negate the Party's leading role. May I ask, wasn't the great victory of the all-round Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction and the national rural people's communization in 1958 a historical miracle achieved by relying on the Party's putting politics in command and resolutely implementing the mass line?

    To ensure the unified leadership of the Party, all revolutionary organizations, whether they are government, army, people's organizations, or political and legal departments such as public security, courts, and procuratorates, or departments such as finance and economy, culture and education, science and health, must be placed under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and local Party committees at all levels (including primary Party committees) to carry out work and struggle to realize the Party's general line and general tasks. Because the Chinese Communist Party is a long-tested party that can best represent the interests of the people, all revolutionary organizations consciously and voluntarily accept the leadership of the Party. Only in this way can the work of all revolutionary organizations be correct in direction and clear in goals, and can they play their active role in the common revolutionary cause. However, in our actual work, we often encounter leaders of some units who are keen on carrying out "independent activities" in their own units, exaggerating the establishment of necessary system leadership and the guiding relationship between higher and lower levels to an inappropriate degree, and even advocating the fallacy that "laymen cannot lead experts," asking the Party for various powers and treating the units they lead as "independent kingdoms." Some units are only willing to accept the leadership of higher-level business departments and are unwilling to obey the unified leadership of local Party committees at the same level. Obviously, these ideas and actions actually deny the Party's unified leadership and deny the role of local Party committees at all levels as the highest organizational form and leadership core in their respective regions under the leadership of the Central Committee. This ideological tendency is very dangerous, and many comrades have committed serious political errors as a result of adhering to this error, which has resulted in the loss of Party leadership and mass supervision in the work they lead.

    Although some comrades also admit the Party's leading role in words, they say that the Party can only exercise political and ideological leadership over non-Party organizations, not organizational leadership, otherwise, it will interfere with the "independence" of these organizations. Everyone knows that the Party's line, principles, and policies are implemented by relying on the Party's various organizations (including the Party's organizations in state organs and people's organizations) and all Party members to unite and lead the broad masses of the people. Organizational leadership is the guarantee for implementing political leadership. May I ask, without specific organizational leadership, without the Party's leadership over Party groups and Communist Party members in state organs and people's organizations, what guarantee is there for the implementation of the Party's line, principles, and policies? What is there to talk about the Party's political and ideological leadership? It should be pointed out that the essence of their denial that Communist Party members in non-Party organizations must unconditionally obey the Party's organizational leadership is not to regard themselves as Communist Party members dispatched by the Party to work in non-Party organizations, but to regard themselves as representatives of cliques within the Communist Party; not to regard the Party as the highest organizational form of the proletariat, but to regard the Party as a free association of various groups. Obviously, this view is completely wrong. In fact, the "independence" of any revolutionary organization from the leadership of the Communist Party does not exist. If they do not accept the leadership of the Communist Party, they will inevitably accept the leadership of the bourgeoisie. When Lenin refuted the slogan of "independence" for trade unions to separate from the leadership of the Communist Party in 1919, he pointed out that in the class struggle, "all remarks about independence or general democracy, no matter what disguise they are wrapped in, are a great deception and a betrayal of socialism." Doesn't the behavior of those who oppose the Party's leadership over non-Party organizations illustrate this truth?

    Some people will say, doesn't doing this really become "not separating the Party from the government"? The answer to this question is that we are first advocates of not separating the Party from the government, and then advocates of separating the Party from the government. In our socialist country led by the proletariat, there is only one "political design institute," and there cannot be two "political design institutes." All general lines and general tasks, all general principles and general arrangements for work, can only be implemented under the unified leadership of the Party; and all non-Party revolutionary organizations can only avoid getting lost and do their work well by implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies under the unified leadership of the Party. Of course, this does not mean that the Party can take over the daily affairs of state organs and people's organizations and other non-Party organizations and confuse the principled distinction between the Communist Party and all non-Party organizations. On the contrary, we believe that only when the Communist Party can not only draw a clear line in principle from all other classes, but also stand in front of the masses of its own class and adhere to its vanguard role ideologically, politically, and organizationally, can it better realize its leadership over non-Party organizations and more effectively improve the ideological awareness and organizational level of the masses. Therefore, the phenomena of "Party-society integration" and "Party-government integration" that have occurred in individual places are also wrong. It actually confuses the highest organizational form of the working class with non-Party revolutionary organizations, thereby reducing the proletarian vanguard role of the Party. We have criticized and corrected this error.

    Our Party has always adhered to the leadership system that combines collective leadership with division of labor and responsibility. We believe that only through the collective can the role of individuals be correctly played; and only when collective leadership is combined with individual responsibility can its due role be fully played. In a leading group, there must be not only division of labor and responsibility, but also someone to take overall responsibility, just as an orchestra must have a good conductor and a class must have a strong class leader. Party committees at all levels must also have their own leadership core. Otherwise, without a leader, everyone will act on their own, and it will never be possible to march in unison and act together. This is common sense and a truth. Right-leaning opportunists fundamentally do not understand the unity of collective leadership and individual role (the unity of the Party committee and the first secretary). They oppose the first secretary taking command, saying that this is "dictatorship" and "undemocratic." In fact, they only want to overthrow the so-called Party "dictatorship" and implement dictatorship themselves. This is a set of methods for conspiring to usurp the leadership of the Party. We say that the core of collective leadership is the concentrated expression of collective wisdom; the first secretary takes command of major work, which means that the first secretary should be a good squad leader and do a good job in leading the way. It is by no means a separation from collective leadership and the implementation of personal "dictatorship." Party committees at all levels, especially the Party's high-level leading organs, have a leading core that is loyal to Marxism-Leninism, has been tempered by the flames of revolution for a long time, and is closely linked to the masses. This is an important guarantee for our Party to withstand any risks. The fact that right-leaning opportunists are directing their spearhead at the Party's leadership is an attempt to disintegrate the Party's core, disintegrate the masses' core, and disintegrate the proletarian vanguard. We must thoroughly expose this and resolutely fight back.

    The essence of the above-mentioned errors of opposing putting politics in command, opposing the core leading role of Party committees at all levels, opposing the Party's leadership over non-Party organizations, and opposing the first secretary taking command, which reduce, weaken, and even abolish the Party's leadership, is the reflection of bourgeois individualism, liberalism, and anarchism within the Party, which is fundamentally opposed to the Party spirit of the proletariat. The experience and lessons of revolutionary struggles over a long period of time, especially the experience and lessons of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, have taught us a simple but most fundamental truth: no matter what revolutionary organization, whenever it deviates from the Party's leadership, it will make big mistakes, can only do bad things, and cannot do good things; any revolutionary organization should completely place itself under the Party's leadership in order to play an active role in the revolutionary cause and avoid making big mistakes. On this issue, education must be repeatedly conducted among cadres and Party members. The same experience and lessons tell us that in the proletarian ranks, bourgeois individualism is the source of all evils. If Communist Party members, especially high-level Party cadres, have individualistic ideas and do not overcome them, they will inevitably fight for power and profit within the Party until they embark on the criminal road of opposing the Party and the people. Therefore, it is necessary to closely combine strengthening the Party's leadership over all revolutionary organizations with strengthening the Party's ideological work, educating every Party member and cadre, strengthening Party spirit training, and consciously becoming a docile tool of the Party. Adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, seriously criticizing and overcoming various erroneous tendencies that reduce, weaken, and even abolish the Party's leadership, and constantly consolidating and strengthening the Party's leading role in all aspects are a regular and important task in our Party's construction.

    In order to ensure the unified leadership of the Party over all revolutionary organizations and all revolutionary work, the Party Central Committee has formulated a series of leadership systems for implementing this fundamental principle. In the army, our Party has implemented the system of chief officers assuming responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee since the beginning of the army's establishment. In recent years, the system of factory director assuming responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee has been implemented in the administrative management of factories and enterprises, and the system of the school affairs committee headed by the president assuming responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee has been implemented in institutions of higher learning. The implementation of these systems not only ensures the unified leadership of the Party, but also fully plays the responsible spirit of administrative leaders, thereby greatly strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses and maximizing the initiative and creativity of the masses. This is a creative development of the Party's construction and the mass line by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong based on the experience of our country's revolution.

    When the whole country celebrates the great victory of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, when we talk about the Chinese Communist Party being the greatest, most glorious, and most correct revolutionary party in our country's history, our mood is extremely excited, we feel infinite pride and pride, and we naturally think of the complete victory of our country's democratic revolution, the great victory of the socialist revolution, the brilliant achievements of socialist construction, and our country's lofty status in the international arena, which are inseparable from the glorious name of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of our Party and the people of the whole country, and his outstanding leadership of Marxism-Leninism, which is invincible. The lofty prestige of Comrade Mao Zedong as the great leader of our Party and the people of the whole country, and the lofty prestige of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are an important guarantee for our Party to carry out unified leadership over all revolutionary undertakings, and are an important guarantee for the victorious development of our revolutionary undertakings. The historical facts of the Chinese revolution and Chinese construction have proved and will continue to prove that when the revolutionary or construction undertakings are under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong and his thought, the revolution develops and wins, and the construction undertakings advance by leaps and bounds; and when the revolutionary or construction undertakings deviate from the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong and his thought, the revolution fails and the construction undertakings suffer setbacks. Our Party and the people of the whole country have found their great leader Comrade Mao Zedong in the long-term revolutionary struggle. This is a sign of our Party's maturity and a sign of our Party's victory. Comrade Mao Zedong is the most outstanding representative of our country's heroic proletariat, the most outstanding representative of the excellent traditions of our great nation since history, the lighthouse for our country to advance on the road of communism, and also the most outstanding Marxist-Leninist revolutionary, politician, and theorist of our time. He has creatively enriched the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism on a series of major issues. The Chinese Communists and the broad masses of the people who have suffered under the reactionary rule in the dark night and won victory after a historically rare arduous struggle, always think of their leader with a very kind and infinitely respectful feeling when reviewing the past and looking forward to the future, and think of the decisive role played by Comrade Mao Zedong in achieving the victory of our country's revolutionary and construction undertakings. More than 600 million people in our country place their happiness, hope, and future on him and regard him as the embodiment of communism, the embodiment of truth, and the invincible banner. Comrade Mao Zedong's influence, wisdom, experience, and his thought of combining Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, are the most valuable wealth of our Party and the people of our country. The love for the Party's leader is completely consistent with the love for the Party, for the class, for the people, and for our great motherland.

    Let us raise the victorious banner of Comrade Mao Zedong higher, and further strengthen and consolidate our great and glorious Party ideologically, politically, and organizationally. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, let us work together with one heart and one mind, unite closely, lead the 650 million people of the whole country, ride the wind and waves, forge ahead bravely, resolutely implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and strive hard to build our country as soon as possible into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    中国共产党是中国人民建设社会主义的最高统帅
    中共中央书记处候补书记　刘澜涛
    1949年中华人民共和国的成立，开辟了我国历史的新纪元，使我国几亿被剥削、被压迫的劳动人民从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的罪恶统治下彻底解放出来，破天荒地取得了全国范围的统治权力，中国共产党成为领导全国政权的唯一的革命政党。十年来，我们党又经过了无限光辉的历程。党领导全国人民取得了民主革命的彻底胜利，紧接着又取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利，并且取得了社会主义建设的辉煌成就，我国人民多少年来所向往的社会主义制度已经在我们祖国广阔富饶的土地上巩固地建立起来了。这是马克思列宁主义在中国的伟大胜利，是中国共产党领导的伟大胜利。
    建国十年来，中国共产党的组织有了空前巨大的发展，全党党员由1949年的四百五十万人增加到现在的一千三百九十六万人。党的基层组织由1949年的二十五万个发展到现在的一百零六万个。无论在城镇和乡村、工矿企业和人民公社、机关学校和人民解放军的连队，都普遍地建立了党的基层组织；在全国各个少数民族地区也都建立了党的组织。十年来，我们久经革命烽火锻炼的老干部迅速地掌握了建设社会主义的各种本领，同时在工人、农民和革命知识分子中提拔和培养了几百万优秀的新干部，他们在政治、经济、国防、外交、文化、教育、科学、艺术等各个战线上担负着光荣的领导责任。十年来，全党经过几次整党和整风运动，深入地、系统地进行了社会主义、共产主义教育，严肃地批判了脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义作风，集中地反对了妨害和破坏社会主义事业的资产阶级思想，并且向一切违反党的路线、方针和政策的错误进行了坚决斗争，同时把数以万计的混入党内的反革命分子、阶级异己分子、资产阶级右派分子、严重违法乱纪分子和其他各种坏分子，从我们光荣的共产党的队伍清除了出去。从而，空前地纯洁和巩固了党的组织，极大地提高了广大党员共产主义的觉悟程度，使我们党的建设达到了高度的马克思列宁主义水平。
    在长期的革命斗争中，我们的党和全国人民建立了血肉不可分离的关系，并且在人民群众中享有崇高的威信。党的各级领导干部和广大党员，不论在劳动中、战斗中和各种工作中，都以奋不顾身、大公无私的精神，和群众同甘苦、共患难。人民群众把他们当做自己的知心人、好朋友和好同志，情同兄弟姊妹。人民群众从长期的革命斗争中亲切地体验到，中国共产党是广大劳动群众自己的党，是中国人民利益的唯一代表者。
    中国共产党是由中国工人阶级和劳动人民中最进步、最优秀、最勇敢和有共产主义觉悟的分子组成的工人阶级的先锋队，是中国工人阶级的阶级组织的最高形式。在中国实现社会主义和共产主义的伟大目标，是我们共产党人的神圣职责，马克思列宁主义是我们一切行动的指南。我们的党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，坚持了马克思列宁主义与中国革命具体实践相结合的方针，因而就能够真正通晓社会发展规律和我国革命斗争的规律，正确掌握革命形势的发展变化，及时地提出历史的新任务，制定正确的政治路线和组织路线，领导全国人民从一个革命阶段前进到另一个革命阶段，从一个胜利走到另一个胜利。历史证明，中国共产党是我国历史上最伟大、最光荣、最正确的革命政党，是一个政治上完全成熟的马克思列宁主义的政党，只有中国共产党才能担当中国人民进行革命和建设的最高统帅。毛泽东同志早就指出，“领导中国民主主义革命和中国社会主义革命这样两个伟大的革命达到彻底的完成，除了中国共产党之外，是没有任何一个别的政党（不论是资产阶级的政党或小资产阶级的政党）能够担负的。”因此，坚持不渝地加强和巩固党在一切革命斗争中的领导作用，是我国社会主义事业胜利的根本保证。
    十分明显，要不要共产党的领导的问题，就是要不要社会主义的问题，是有关中国命运的重大问题，是我国过渡时期中资产阶级同无产阶级、资本主义道路同社会主义道路“谁战胜谁”的斗争中的根本问题。十年来，我国历次广大群众的革命运动，特别是1957年反对资产阶级右派的斗争经验，都颠扑不破地证实了这一革命真理。1957年资产阶级右派进攻的主要目标，也就是中国共产党对中国社会主义事业的领导权。但是，经过全国范围的思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命，共产党并没有像资产阶级右派分子所梦想的那样退出“一切阵地”，而是在各个战线上空前地加强了党的领导；不是我国无产阶级专政垮台，而是共产党领导的无产阶级专政的人民天下更加坚强、更加巩固了。资产阶级右派，同共产党和人民较量的结果，遭到了可耻的惨败。
    现在，我国的社会主义革命，虽然已经在经济战线、思想战线和政治战线上都取得了决定性的胜利，但是，阶级斗争并没有结束。我国国外还存在着帝国主义，国内还存在着阶级；城乡资产阶级反动的思想活动和政治活动仍然存在，并且，一有机会他们就要兴风作浪，妄图撼动无产阶级专政的根基和社会主义大厦。因此，资产阶级同无产阶级的思想斗争和政治斗争，仍然是长期复杂的，是时起时伏波浪式发展的，有时还会是很尖锐的。这种斗争还要继续几十年，直到阶级斗争完全熄灭为止。
    资产阶级同无产阶级的你死我活的斗争，必然要反映到党内来。这也是毫不足怪的。资产阶级的反社会主义思潮总是从各个方面影响和腐蚀我们的党，帝国主义和国内外的一切反动势力总是千方百计地在我们党内寻找他们的代理人，从党的内部、从党的领导核心来进行破坏。而我们党内的动摇分子和不可靠分子，总是容易接受他们的影响；混入党内的投机分子、阶级异己分子和具有资产阶级世界观的个人野心家，也必然会站在资产阶级的立场上，企图按照资产阶级的世界观和资产阶级的愿望，把党改造成为机会主义的政党，以达到他们篡夺革命领导权的目的。在民主革命时期，我们党内出现过陈独秀、张国焘等资产阶级在党内的代理人。在社会主义革命时期，一些在民主革命时期加入我们党而毫无社会主义革命精神准备的资产阶级革命家和马克思主义者的同路人，当资产阶级和小资产阶级的生产资料私有制要被全面地、彻底地最后消灭的时候，他们反动的资产阶级思想就决定他们一定要起来坚决反抗，他们就必然同国内外反动势力遥相呼应，进行反党活动。高岗饶漱石反党联盟就是适应了帝国主义和资产阶级反革命分子愿望的资产阶级在党内的代理人。现在，一些右倾机会主义分子反对党的总路线，反对大跃进，反对人民公社，他们向党进攻的实质，正是代表资产阶级的利益，破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设。十分明显，如果不彻底粉碎他们的反党活动，党就不能战胜资产阶级的反抗，巩固地掌握国家的领导权，领导全国人民取得革命和建设的胜利。马克思列宁主义的政党是统一的战斗组织，必须有严密的组织和铁的纪律。党的团结和统一，是党的生命。党内绝对不能容许有任何的机会主义派别存在，绝对不能容许有任何分裂党、篡夺党的言论和行动。同情、纵容这些反党活动，以及在和反党活动进行严肃的斗争中，任何调和和动摇的表现，不管他们的主观愿望如何，实际上都是帮助资产阶级，反对无产阶级。
    要保证党的统一领导，就必须坚持政治挂帅，在一切社会领域里兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想，按照马克思主义的世界观指导一切革命工作。思想工作和政治工作永远是我们一切工作的灵魂和统帅。必须了解，任何地方无产阶级不挂帅，资产阶级就必然要挂帅；任何地方放弃和忽略党的思想工作和政治工作，就会脱离群众，迷失方向，走入歧路。有人坚决反对政治挂帅，他们说，思想工作和政治工作既不能出粮食，又不能出钢铁，不解决任何实际问题。他们这种把党的政治领导同群众的实际工作，把政治同业务完全割裂开来的思想，实际上是要削弱以至根本否定党的领导作用。试问，1958年我国社会主义建设全面大跃进和全国农村人民公社化的伟大胜利，这难道不是依靠党的政治挂帅和坚决贯彻执行群众路线所取得的历史奇迹吗？
    要保证党的统一领导，就必须把一切革命组织，不论是政府、军队、人民团体，不论是公安、法院、检察等政法部门，或者是财政经济、文化教育、科学卫生等部门，都置于党中央和地方各级党委（包括基层党委）的统一领导下进行工作，为实现党的总路线和总任务而斗争。由于中国共产党是久经考验的、最能代表人民利益的政党，所以一切革命组织也就都自觉自愿地接受党的领导。因为只有这样，一切革命组织的工作才能够方向正确，目标清楚，在共同的革命事业中发挥他们的积极作用。可是，我们在实际工作中也常遇到有些单位的领导者，他们热衷于开展本单位的“独立活动”，把建立必要的系统领导和上下级之间的业务指导关系，夸大到不适当的程度，甚至宣扬“外行不能领导内行”的谬论，向党要求各种权力，把自己领导的单位当作“独立王国”。也有些单位只愿接受上级业务部门的领导，不愿服从地方同级党委的统一领导。很显然，这些思想和行动实际上是否认党的统一领导，否认地方各级党委在中央领导下是各该地区的最高组织形式和领导核心的作用。这种思想倾向是很危险的，有不少同志由于坚持这种错误，结果就使他们领导的工作失掉了党的领导和群众的监督，从而犯了严重的政治错误。
    有一些同志虽然在口头上也承认党的领导作用，但是他们说，党对于非党组织只能实行政治思想领导，不能实行组织领导，否则，就是干涉了这些组织的“独立性”。大家知道，党的路线、方针和政策，是依靠党的各个组织（包括党在国家机关和人民团体中的组织）和全体党员，团结和带领广大人民群众实现的。组织领导是实行政治领导的保证。试问，离开具体的组织领导，离开了党对国家机关和人民团体中的党组和共产党员的领导，党的路线、方针和政策的贯彻执行还有什么保证呢？还谈得上什么党的政治思想领导呢？应当指出，他们否认非党组织中的共产党员必须无条件地服从党的组织领导的实质是，不是把自己当成党派到非党组织中工作的共产党员，而是把自己看为在共产党内的行帮代表；不是把党看做是无产阶级的最高组织形式，而是把党当做各个团体的自由联合会。很显然，这种意见是完全错误的。事实上，任何革命组织脱离共产党领导的“独立性”是不存在的。他们不接受共产党的领导，就必然要接受资产阶级的领导。列宁在1919年驳斥要工会脱离共产党领导而“独立”的口号时，曾经指出过，在阶级斗争中，“一切关于独立性或一般民主的言论，不管它们披上什么伪装，都是极大的骗局，都是背叛社会主义”。那些反对党对非党组织实行领导的人的所作所为，不正是说明了这个真理吗？
    又有人会说，你们这样做，不是真的成了“党政不分”了吗？对这个问题的回答是，我们首先是党政不分论者，然后才是党政要分论者。在我们无产阶级领导的社会主义国家里，只有一个“政治设计院”，不能有两个“政治设计院”，一切总路线和总任务，一切工作的总方针和总部署，都只能由党实行一元化领导；而一切非党革命组织只有在党的统一领导下，贯彻执行党的路线、方针和政策，才不至于迷失方向，才有可能把工作做好。当然，这绝不是说，党可以包办国家机关和人民团体等非党组织的日常事务，混淆共产党同一切非党组织的原则区别。恰恰相反，我们认为，只有当共产党能够不仅在原则上同一切其它阶级划清界限，并且能够站在本阶级群众的最前面，在思想上、政治上和组织上坚持自己先锋队作用的时候，才能更好地实现对非党组织的领导，才能更有效地提高群众的思想觉悟程度和组织程度。因此，个别地方发生过的“党社合一”、“党政合一”的现象，也是不对的，它实际上是要把工人阶级的最高组织形式同非党革命组织混同起来，从而降低党的无产阶级先锋队作用，我们已经批判和纠正了这种错误。
    我们的党始终坚持集体领导和分工负责相结合的领导制度。我们认为，只有通过集体，个人的作用才能得到正确的发挥；而集体领导也只有同个人负责相结合，才能充分发挥其应有的作用。在一个领导集团里，不仅要有分工负责，还必须要有人负总的责任，如同一个乐队必须有一个很好的指挥、一个班必须要有一个坚强的班长一样，各级党委也必须有自己的领导核心。否则，群龙无首，各行其是，就绝不能整齐步伐，共同行动。这是一个常识，也是一个真理。右倾机会主义分子根本不懂得集体领导和个人作用的统一（党委和第一书记的统一），他们反对第一书记挂帅，说这是“独裁”、这是“不民主”。其实，他们只是要攻倒所谓党的“独裁”，而由他们自己来实行独裁，这是阴谋篡夺党的领导权的一套手法。我们说，集体领导中的核心是集体智慧的集中表现；重大的工作由第一书记挂帅，就是要第一书记当好班长，做好带头工作，决不是什么脱离集体领导，实行个人“独裁”。各级党委特别是党的高级领导机关，具有忠于马克思列宁主义、久经革命烽火锻炼、同群众密切联系的领导核心，是我们党经得起任何风险的重要保证。右倾机会主义分子把矛头指向党的领导，正是企图使党的核心解体，使群众的核心解体，企图使无产阶级先锋队解体。对于这一点，我们必须彻底加以揭露，必须坚决予以回击。
    以上所说的反对政治挂帅，反对各级党委的核心领导作用，反对党对非党组织的领导，反对第一书记挂帅等降低、削弱以至取消党的领导的错误的实质，是资产阶级个人主义、自由主义、无政府主义在党内的反映，是同无产阶级的党性根本对立的。长期以来革命斗争的经验教训，特别是反右派斗争和整风运动的经验教训，告诉了我们一个简单的、但却是最根本的道理，不论任何革命组织，什么时候脱离了党的领导，什么时候就要犯大错误，只能办坏事，不能办好事；任何革命组织要在革命事业中发挥积极作用，避免犯大的错误，就应当把自己完全置于党的领导之下。关于这一问题，必须经常不断地在干部和党员中反复进行教育。同样的经验教训告诉我们，在无产阶级队伍里，资产阶级个人主义是万恶之源，共产党员特别是党的高级干部，如果具有个人主义思想而不加以克服，就必然要在党内争权夺利，直到走向反党反人民的罪恶道路。因此，必须把加强党对一切革命组织的领导，同加强党的思想工作紧密地结合起来，教育每个党员干部，加强党性锻炼，自觉地成为党的驯服工具。坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，严肃地批判和克服各种降低、削弱以至取消党的领导的各种错误倾向，不断地巩固和加强党在各方面的领导作用，是我们党的建设中的一项经常的重要任务。
    为了保证党对一切革命组织和一切革命工作的统一领导，党中央规定了一系列实行这一根本原则的领导制度。在军队中，我党从建军开始，就实行了党委领导下的首长分工负责制。近几年来，在工厂、企业的行政管理上实行了党委领导下的厂长负责制，在高等学校中实行了党委领导下的以校长为首的校务委员会负责制，等等。这些制度的贯彻执行，既保证了党的统一领导，又充分地发挥了行政领导人的负责精神，从而也就大大地密切了党同群众的联系，最大限度地发挥了群众的主动性和创造性。这是以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会，根据我国革命的经验，对于党的建设和群众路线的创造性的发展。
    当着全国欢庆建国十周年伟大胜利的时候，当我们谈到中国共产党是我国历史上最伟大、最光荣、最正确的革命政党的时候，我们的心情是异常兴奋的，我们感到无限的骄傲和自豪，我们很自然地想到了我国民主革命的彻底胜利、社会主义革命的伟大胜利、社会主义建设的光辉成就和我国在国际上的崇高地位，是同我们党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志光荣的名字、他的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的杰出领导不可分离的。毛泽东同志作为我们党的和全国人民的伟大领袖的崇高威信，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的崇高威信，是我们党对一切革命事业进行统一领导的重要保证，是我们的革命事业胜利发展的重要保证。中国革命和中国建设的历史事实已经并将继续证明，当着革命或建设事业在毛泽东同志及其思想的指导之下的时候，革命就发展、胜利，建设事业就突飞猛进；而当着革命或建设事业脱离了毛泽东同志及其思想指导的时候，革命就失败，建设事业就受挫折。我们党和全国人民在长期的革命斗争中找到了自己的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，这是我们党成熟的标志，这是我们党胜利的标志。毛泽东同志是我国英勇无产阶级的最杰出的代表，是我们伟大民族有史以来优秀传统的最杰出的代表，是我国向共产主义道路前进的灯塔，也是当代最杰出的一个马克思列宁主义革命家、政治家和理论家，他在一系列重大问题上创造性地丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。在黑夜茫茫的反动统治下饱受苦难、经过历史上罕与匹比的艰苦斗争而赢得胜利的中国共产党人和广大人民，回顾过去，瞻望将来，总是以十分亲切和无限尊崇的心情想到自己的领袖，想到毛泽东同志在取得我国革命和建设事业胜利中所起的决定性作用。我国六亿多人民把自己的幸福、希望和未来寄托在他的身上，把他看做是共产主义的化身，是真理的化身，是战无不胜的旗帜。毛泽东同志的影响、智慧、经验和他创造的马克思列宁主义同中国革命具体实践相结合的思想即毛泽东思想，是我们党和我国人民最宝贵的财富。对于党的领袖的热爱，是同对于党、对于阶级、对于人民、对于我们伟大祖国的热爱完全一致的。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东同志的胜利旗帜，进一步从思想上、政治上和组织上加强和巩固我们伟大的光荣的党，在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会领导下，同心同德，亲密团结，领导着全国六亿五千万人民，乘风破浪，奋勇前进，坚决贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，为把我国尽快地建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国而奋斗。
