Thirty Thousand Finance and Trade Workers Invest in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
Shandong Market Appears a New Prosperous Scene

(Our newspaper dispatch) Shandong Province's more than 300,000 finance and trade workers, enthusiastically responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have rapidly set off a new high tide of socialist competition for comprehensive leaps forward, vigorously supporting the current industrial and agricultural production and the increase production and practice economy movement on all fronts.

Finance and trade workers distributed in various positions such as purchasing, supply, taxation, finance, and service, after studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held various meetings to express their determination, revise plans, increase measures, and launch competitions. Thousands of advanced units and tens of thousands of advanced workers who were rated as red banner pacesetters in the first half of the year stood at the forefront of the movement. Wang Zhendong, a general merchandise salesman from Hubin Store in Boxing County who has been rated as a red banner all-rounder for five consecutive years, is out in the fields day and night. In seven days and seven nights, he supplied 900 pieces of water utensils and sold 760 yuan worth of goods; he carried the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC to conduct propaganda anytime, anywhere. Commercial employees of the Liaocheng Special District held a 5,000-person oath-taking rally, implementing three guarantees and four arrivals in the field: guarantee supply, guarantee installation, guarantee repair; inspection arrival in the field, delivery arrival in the field, repair arrival in the field, technical instruction arrival in the field. In Pingyuan County, the number of personnel who went to the countryside to deliver goods in the past was only 1,300, but now it has increased to 1,667. In two days, they supplied more than 40,000 pieces of water utensils and agricultural tools, and 200,000 jin of fertilizer. They proposed: "Not afraid of the sun, not afraid of the long distance, not afraid of storms, follow the sun and moon." In many places, competition was carried out between cooperatives, stations, stores, groups, and individuals. In Jinan City, more than 80% of the units participated in the competition; the error rate of the People's Department Store was reduced to 0.0113%, and nine units of the Daguanyuan Department Store basically eliminated errors.

This surging mass movement has created a prosperous leap forward situation on the finance and trade front. At present, the supply of materials for the Three Autumn harvests has been greatly strengthened. The provincial commercial departments have arranged to allocate 58.82 million jin of mechanical pesticides and 400 million jin of chemical fertilizers to various places. In terms of the supply of agricultural tools, according to statistics from eight special districts by the end of August, more than 14.22 million pieces of "Three Autumn" agricultural tools and parts have been arranged for production. Jinan area counties generally convened meetings on industrial, agricultural and commercial cooperation, balanced the Three Autumn production plan, and signed contracts for 1.47 million products through production, purchase and sales contracts. Wen Shang County extracted a large number of technical personnel from various grassroots stores to form more than 700 red furnaces to repair various agricultural tools. Warmly welcomed by the broad masses.

The current purchasing work is also surging like a tide, and the progress is accelerating. The early autumn grain purchase work is progressing at a rate of more than 100 million jin per day; the purchase of cotton, tobacco, and jute has also gradually begun. The purchase of non-staple foods such as live pigs and fresh eggs and the purchase of waste products have also increased several times or even several times. In Yiyuan County, the purchase of live pigs in August exceeded the plan by 54.7%, and the purchase of fresh eggs exceeded the plan by 23.8%. The province's purchase volume of live pigs in late August increased three and a half times compared with early August, and the daily purchase volume in early September increased more than one time compared with mid-August. More and more non-staple foods are on the market, and a new prosperous scene has appeared in the market.

    三十万财贸职工投入增产节约运动
    山东市场出现新的繁荣景象
    本报讯　山东省三十多万财贸职工，热烈响应党的八中全会的伟大号召，迅速掀起一个全面跃进的社会主义竞赛新高潮，有力地支援了当前工农业生产和各个战线上的增产节约运动。
    分布在采购、供应、税收、金融、服务等各个岗位上的财贸职工，学习党的八中全会公报和决议后，纷纷举行各种会议，表示决心，修订计划，加大措施，开展竞赛。上半年被评为红旗标兵的数千名先进单位和数万名先进工作者，站在运动的最前列。博兴县湖滨商店连续五年被评为红旗多面手的日用百货售货员王振东，日夜出没在田间。在七天七夜当中，供应水具九百件，售货七百六十元；他带着中共八届八中全会的文件随时随地进行宣传。聊城专区商业职工举行五千人誓师大会，实行三包四到田：包供应、包安装、包修配；检查到田、送货到田、修配到田、技术传授到田。平原县过去下乡送货的人员只有一千三百人，现在增加到一千六百六十七人。两天供应水具农具四万多件，肥料二十万斤，他们提出：“不怕太阳晒、不怕路途远、不怕暴风雨、跟着太阳月亮转。”许多地方社与社、站与站、门市与门市、组与组、人与人开展了对手赛。济南市有80％以上的单位参加了对手赛；人民商场差错率降低到万分之一点一三，大观园商场有九个单位基本杜绝了差错。
    这种巨浪滔天的群众运动，使财贸战线出现一片欣欣向荣的跃进形势。目前，三秋生产资料的供应，已经大大加强。省商业部门已安排调拨各地机制农药五千八百八十二万斤，化肥四亿斤。在农具供应上到8月底据八个专区统计，已安排生产的“三秋”农具及零件一千四百二十二万多件。济南地区各县普遍召开了工农商协作会议，平衡了三秋生产计划，通过产购销合同，签订产品一百四十七万多件。汶上县从各基层商店中抽出大批技术人员，组成七百多台红炉，下去修理各种农具。受到广大群众热烈欢迎。
    现在的收购工作也势如潮涌，进展加快。早秋粮食征购工作，正以日进一亿多斤的速度进展；棉、烟、黄麻的收购，也逐步开展起来。生猪、鲜蛋等副食品收购和废品收购工作也成倍的甚至几倍的增长。沂源县8月份生猪收购超计划54.7％，鲜蛋超计划23.8％。全省生猪收购量8月下旬比上旬增加三倍半，9月上旬日收量又比8月中旬增加一倍多。副食品上市量越来越多，市场上出现了又一个新的繁荣景象。
