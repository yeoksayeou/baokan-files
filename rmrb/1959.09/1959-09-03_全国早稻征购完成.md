Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: As of August 26th, the national procurement of early rice reached 102.9% of the procurement plan, exceeding the procurement task ahead of schedule by five days. The quality of the early rice put into storage is generally good.

This year's early rice procurement work was carried out under the conditions of rushing to harvest and plant, and vigorously fighting drought. All people's communes properly arranged labor to ensure that rushing to harvest and plant, fighting drought, and procurement work were not delayed. Party secretaries in many regions personally led the way, "sounded the three gongs and drums together" for rushing to harvest and plant, fighting drought, and procuring grain, and completed the early rice procurement task in one go. Communes in bumper harvest areas actively sold surplus grain to the state to support disaster-stricken areas.

In the early rice procurement work, all localities implemented the distribution methods of unified annual settlement of procurement tasks, more delivery in summer and less delivery in autumn, ration distribution to households according to individual needs, canteen meals with tickets, and savings returned to the individual. Sufficient seeds, rations, and necessary feed were retained, which improved the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for production and grain delivery.
