Striving for Increased Production and Seizing the Red Flag
Dongtai and Qingfeng Resolve to Harvest and Manage Cotton Well to Greet National Day
(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Over 100,000 people in Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province, are engaged in a mass cotton overproduction campaign, determined to harvest and manage cotton well and dedicate a bumper harvest to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
This year, Dongtai County's 500,000 mu of wheat-stubble cotton has grown very well after four months of careful cultivation, overcoming drought and pests. Bolls began to open in late August, about fifteen days earlier than last year. 88% of the cotton plants are in the first and second category, with green stalks and leaves, and bolls all over. Even the 12% of plants in the third category are covered with young bolls. Under these circumstances, a new right-leaning slackening of thought emerged. Areas with good growth believed that a bumper harvest was assured this year, and the red flag was secure. Areas with poor growth were not rushing or competing, saying they would try again next year. However, after the Party Central Committee issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the county launched a wide and in-depth publicity and discussion campaign, summarized the experiences and lessons of cotton field management last year, smashed right-leaning thought, boosted enthusiasm, and immediately launched an overproduction competition campaign between communes, production teams, and groups.
Communes and production teams have universally put forward the slogan of "grasping harvesting with one hand and management with the other, never relaxing management as long as cotton stalks are not removed," and have formulated overproduction action plans. The county has fully prepared the material resources for a bumper harvest, with more than 5,000 cotton warehouses and more than 35,000 drying mats ready. The county has established a professional cotton-picking team of 50,000 people, ensuring that every boll is picked as it opens, no boll rots, and no petal is lost; and has formulated an acceptance and reward system to ensure good harvesting, drying, storage, and sales. After the typhoon and heavy rain at the end of August and the beginning of September, the county organized more than 100,000 laborers to launch a two-day blitz, picking three million jin of cotton, and promptly turned and dried it, achieving picking, drying, and warehousing simultaneously. According to statistics from 23 communes, more than one million jin of cotton have been sold to the state.

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) More than 200,000 farmers in Qingfeng County, Henan Province, are strengthening the late-stage management of cotton fields, vowing to achieve a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, to dedicate to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Qingfeng County is located in the cotton-producing area of northern Henan, with more than 210,000 mu of cotton planted this year. After conscientiously studying the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, cadres and the masses are high in spirits and full of enthusiasm, and unanimously agreed to change the original target of 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu to 150 jin. Recently, they also put forward the battle slogan of "attacking the last three stages of cotton fields and vowing to achieve a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu," to increase the production of more cotton to dedicate to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In order to realize this battle slogan, farmers throughout the county have launched a competition between communes, production teams, groups, and individuals to strive for increased production and seize the red flag. Old farmers of the Beigucheng Brigade of the Gucheng Commune offered suggestions and plans to help the entire team win the first red flag. In order to ensure the water demand of cotton and prevent excessive branching and shading due to excessive water, the Liuta Commune universally implemented "less watering, frequent watering, and even watering" when irrigating 3,250 mu of high-lying cotton fields.

In order to push the competition movement to a new climax, the Qingfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently conducted a major inspection and evaluation.
The evaluation results: 187 production brigades, 1,655 production teams, 6,736 work groups, and 36,837 commune members in the county won the red flag in the first round. Through inspection and evaluation, the enthusiasm of the commune members is even greater, and a situation of backward catching up with the advanced and the advanced becoming more advanced has immediately emerged.

    争超产　夺红旗
    东台清丰决心收好管好棉花迎国庆
    据新华社讯　江苏省东台县十万多人大搞棉花超产运动，决心收好管好，用大丰收的成绩向建国十周年献礼。
    今年东台县五十万亩麦茬棉，经过四个月精心培育，战胜了旱魔虫害，长势很好。8月下旬普遍吐絮，比去年提早十五天左右。占88％的一、二类苗青棵绿叶，上下满桃，白花朵朵，仅占12％的三类苗也是嫩桃一片。在这种情况下，曾经产生一种新的右倾松劲思想。长得好的地区，认为今年丰收已定，稳得红旗。长得差的地区，也不赶不争，说明年再来。但是党中央关于增产节约的号召发出以后，全县开展了广泛而深入的宣传和讨论，总结了去年棉花后期管理的经验教训，大破右倾思想，大鼓干劲，立即展开了社与社、队与队、组与组的超产竞赛运动。
    各公社、生产队普遍提出了一手抓收、一手抓管，棉花一天不拔秸，管理一天不放松的行动口号，订出了超产行动计划。全县已充分做好丰收的物质准备，五千多间棉仓、三万五千多条晒花帘子已准备就绪。全县建立了五万人的拾花专业队伍，做到开一朵拾一朵，不烂一个桃，不丢一瓣花；并且制订了验收奖励制度，保证做到收好、晒好、保管好、交售好。8月底、9月初在台风和大雨过后，全县组织十万多劳力突击两天，拾花三百万斤，并且及时翻晒，做到了边开、边拾、边晒、边进仓。据二十三个公社统计，目前已卖给国家棉花一百多万斤。
    据新华社讯　河南清丰县二十多万农民正在加强棉田后期管理，誓夺亩产皮棉双百斤的成绩，向建国十周年献礼。
    清丰县位于豫北产棉区，今年种植棉花二十一万多亩。干部和群众在认真学习了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议以后，斗志昂扬，干劲十足，一致通过将原来计划亩产一百二十斤皮棉的指标改为一百五十斤。最近他们又提出了“猛攻棉田后三关、誓夺亩产皮棉双百斤”的战斗口号，以增产更多的棉花向建国十周年献礼。为了实现这个战斗口号，全县农民掀起了一个社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人之间的争超产夺红旗的竞赛。固城公社北固城大队的老农为了给全队夺取第一面红旗，纷纷献策献计。六塔公社为了保证棉花的需水量，又不致因水大疯枝荫蔽，在灌浇三千二百五十亩高凸棉田时，普遍实行了“少浇、勤浇、匀浇”。
    中共清丰县委为了把竞赛运动推向新的高潮，最近进行了一次大检查大评比。
    评比结果：全县有一百八十七个生产大队、一千六百五十五个生产队、六千七百三十六个作业组和三万六千八百三十七名社员夺得了第一个回合的红旗。通过检查评比，社员们的劲头更大，立即出现了一个后进赶先进、先进更先进的局面。
