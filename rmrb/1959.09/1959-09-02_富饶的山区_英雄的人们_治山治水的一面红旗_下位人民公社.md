Rich Mountainous Area, Heroic People
A Red Banner for Harnessing Mountains and Rivers - Xiawei People's Commune

Located in the Yimeng Mountain area, an old revolutionary base area, the Xiawei People's Commune in Yishui County, Shandong Province, has conquered poor mountains and rivers and fundamentally changed the face of the mountainous area after more than a year of hard work based on water and soil conservation work in the past few years. Here, it is now: shady with green trees, reservoirs and ponds full of water, abundant agricultural harvests, and thriving livestock.

	Difficulties Can't Stop Heroes
The Xiawei People's Commune includes forty-two villages. Of the total area of 186,930 mu, there are 260 large and small mountains, 13 large and small rivers, and more than 1,000 small mountain gullies. There were originally not many trees on the mountains, and they were almost all cut down by the enemy and puppets during the war, resulting in severe soil erosion. Heavy rains would cause mountain floods and landslides; a few days without rain would lead to drought. Poor mountains and rivers led to low agricultural yields and impoverished people's lives. However, the people of the old revolutionary base area, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, did not succumb to the poor mountains and rivers. They turned the harsh natural environment into a driving force for progress. Under the leadership of the Party, they launched a full-scale campaign to conquer nature, determined to transform the barren mountainous area into a rich and beautiful paradise.

Opening mountains and splitting peaks, moving rivers and filling gullies requires great ambition and soaring enthusiasm. In the process of harnessing mountains and rivers, the commune's Party committee educated and inspired members to consciously participate in the work by investigating disaster situations, recounting suffering, calculating the benefits of harnessing mountains and rivers, setting examples, organizing on-site visits, and constantly summarizing and evaluating achievements and commending advanced individuals. They formed over 1,200 skilled young and middle-aged people into year-round mountain management and infrastructure teams, dividing areas and assigning responsibility for each mountain. During agricultural gaps, men and women, young and old, went to the mountains together for short-term concentrated efforts. For more than a year, the year-round infrastructure teams fought on various mountains. Whether it was the freezing cold of winter or the scorching heat of summer, whether it was windy, rainy, or snowy, they persisted in their battle.

Wang Hengquan, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, is a model leader in mountain management recognized by all members. He spent his days climbing mountains and ridges, surveying, designing, working, and imparting technology. In the harsh winter, he carried dry rations, braved strong winds and heavy snow, leaving early and returning late. In just a few months, he traveled almost every mountain and every gully. Last year, when experimenting with the use of water energy, he repeatedly studied and finally created a water-powered grinding model, firing the first shot for large-scale comprehensive utilization of water conservancy.

Communist Party member Zhao Wenhua, in the battle of Niujiao Gu, led 108 team members to manage the front slope, fought hard for eighteen days, and completed the task ahead of schedule. When there were no explosives to build a water pool on the rock, he led the team members to use hammers and picks to create seams in the rock, then insert bars to pry it open. When there were not enough tools to carry stones, they carried them on their backs.

During the mountain management process, the highest attendance in the entire commune reached 11,000 people, accounting for 60% of the total population, and more than 750 model figures emerged.

In this way, they worked hard for more than a year. By June of this year, they had managed 86 large and small mountains, more than 350 branch gullies and small gullies, built 5,948 various projects, constructed 917 reservoirs, ponds, pools, and springs, and built 38 river dams, with a total water storage capacity of 6.55 million cubic meters. If all these projects are fully utilized, 70% of the commune's cultivated land (a total of more than 60,600 mu) can be irrigated, 37,000 mu of terraced fields can be created, and more than 100,000 mu of forests can be planted. These projects can control soil erosion over an area of 96 square kilometers, accounting for 88.4% of the total soil erosion area. At the same time, due to the increase in soil infiltration and the rise in groundwater levels, 71 new mountain springs appeared; the original 48 small mountain springs became larger and more abundant than before; and 80 dry gullies became clear, flowing streams. From then on, the long-dormant barren mountains awakened! The raging floods were tamed!

	Found a Way to Manage Sand and Rocky Mountains
Conquering poor mountains and rivers requires not only hard work but also clever work. The Xiawei People's Commune has made many innovations in project items, surveying and design, and construction during the process of harnessing mountains and rivers.

The first problem encountered in comprehensively managing barren mountains was a lack of expertise in surveying and design, and an ignorance of engineering construction methods. At this time, the Yishui County Party Committee helped the commune's Party committee to set an example first. Wang Hengquan, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, led activists in mountain management, with the help of technicians from Henan, to learn, survey, design, and construct on Niujiao Gu Mountain. Then, they held training classes to cultivate a group of technical talents. In more than a year of practice, more than 100 cadres and activists throughout the commune learned simple surveying and design techniques, and dozens of them mastered the planning, surveying, and design techniques for a complete set of mountain management projects, greatly accelerating the progress of mountain management.

How to comprehensively manage sand and rocky mountains was another problem. Based on the correct policies of the higher-level Party committee, combined with their own experience, after practice, research, more practice, and more research, they finally adapted and developed the mountain management experience of Yuxian County, Henan, according to local conditions, and created and improved a variety of engineering projects. For example, in places where there was very little grass and trees and the soil layer was very thin on sandy and rocky mountains, it was not suitable to build fish-scale pits, so they researched and created mountain-encircling sand-retaining walls. In places where the slope was relatively gentle, the upper part was a bare rock cliff, which could not be used for fish-scale pits or horizontal ditches, and there were many terraced fields below, requiring the construction of projects to block floods and protect the terraced fields, they researched and created mountain-encircling ring-shaped water storage pools. They also created a series of cascading pools in the mountain slope flood diversion canals, so that the intercepted mountain water flowed down the canal to the bottom of the gully and the pond dam reservoir, changing from rapid to slow, reducing the erosion of sand and soil. To increase the survival rate of planted trees, they also created afforestation holes with water storage functions. The original fish-scale pits were prone to collapse when heavy rains and mountain floods overflowed, so they created fish-scale pits with overflow outlets, so that no matter how much rain fell, the water stored in the pits would never exceed the possible capacity. Relying on the collective wisdom and creativity, the Xiawei People's Commune has found a complete set of methods for harnessing mountains and rivers.

	Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, Side Occupations, and Fisheries All Flourish
Just over a year after conquering barren mountains and rivers, the Xiawei People's Commune has seen a prosperous scene of abundant agricultural harvests and thriving livestock.

Walking into the fields of the Xiawei Commune, you can hear the sound of gurgling water everywhere. The water stored in reservoirs, river dams, mountain springs, and pond dams flows slowly along the ring-shaped mountain canals to the fields. This year, the commune's 21,000 mu of sweet potatoes were planted half a month earlier than last year, and each piece of land and each seedling was fully watered. This spring, the water-irrigated area for wheat in the commune accounted for more than 80%. Due to timely sowing, expanded water-irrigated area, thickened soil layer, and improved fertilizer efficiency, agriculture achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1958, with an average yield of 500 jin of grain per mu (including sweet potatoes), an increase of 193% compared to 1957. This summer, the average yield per mu of the commune's 13,000 mu of wheat increased by another 66% compared to 1958.

With the improvement of natural conditions, the members' confidence in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest has become stronger. Since mid-July of this year, there has been no thorough rain here, and crops have been affected by drought. Therefore, mountain springs and wells are being used together, and reservoirs and pond dams are being drained to water the land. Within six days, the commune watered more than 11,000 mu of land.

Summer is a season of abundant water and lush grass, and it is also a good time for livestock grazing. On the slopes and gullies of the Xiawei People's Commune, there are herds of strong and fat cattle, sheep, and pigs everywhere. Since the beginning of this year, the livestock of the Xiawei People's Commune has developed particularly rapidly. The commune has a total of 4,663 sheep, 987 cattle, and 7,198 pigs, an increase of 40% to 50% compared to last year. The reproduction rate of various livestock has greatly increased compared to previous years. In the first half of this year, all 285 cows in the commune were pregnant, and the 134 calves that had been born were all strong. The fattening period of pigs has also been shortened, and the number of sales has increased rapidly. According to statistics from the purchasing department, 1,700 fattened pigs were purchased here in 1958, and 1,180 heads were purchased in the first half of this year. In one season of 1958, the commune's wool income was 2,800 yuan, and this year's income was 4,800 yuan. In addition, the commune also raises 65,000 chickens, 1,100 ducks, 410 geese, and 14,800 rabbits, all of which are full-feathered, strong, and fat. At the same time, 2.16 million fish are raised, and 20 mu of lotus roots are planted, which was something that never happened in the past. The 50,000 fruit trees and 200,000 mulberry trees planted this year are also growing well. Other productions such as beekeeping, scorpion breeding, and medicinal materials have also developed.

	Water Power Replaces Human Power, Fast, Economical, and Labor-Saving
Here, water not only surrounds the high mountains and ridges according to people's will, irrigating the terraced fields along the gravity-fed canals, but also obeys people's commands in all aspects, benefiting people's lives.

In the past, in this mountain village, people sometimes feared water like a tiger, and sometimes cherished water like oil. In the commune, eight villages had to climb mountains and ridges every day, except during the flood season, to fetch water from a place six or seven miles away. Now, not only has the phenomenon of cherishing water like oil disappeared, but six villages have also been provided with running water.

Water also replaces people's labor in all aspects. Since the commune's Party committee successfully trial-produced an impulse turbine in Xiawei Village last autumn, 31 villages in the commune with water sources have successively installed 118 hydropower tools of 14 types, including cotton ginning machines, cotton gins, blowers, straw cutters, and water-powered grinding machines. When we walked to the front of Xiawei Village, we saw water cascading down the cliff, impacting the wooden wheel to rotate. While a girl was doing needlework, she was adding grain to the mill, and white flour was fluttering down. Such a small mill can grind more than 170 jin of flour a day, and the labor required is very slight. Xiawei Village has also established a hydropower station (generating 5 kilowatts). Currently, a reservoir with a water storage capacity of 12 million cubic meters is under construction, and it is planned to build a 150-kilowatt hydropower station using this reservoir.

	Water Conveys Love and Happiness
In the past, girls were unwilling to marry into a few villages with particularly scarce water sources. Now, the young people in these villages no longer have to worry about finding a wife. Niu Yingxin, an old man from Niujia Ping, told us that he is 48 years old this year. As far back as he can remember, this small village with more than 60 households had 12 old bachelors around the age of 50. However, in the past year or two, there have been seven newly married young couples.

Among the seven newly married young couples in Niujia Ping, one pair experienced a vivid story revolving around the issue of water:

Guo Xianglian returned home from the army in 1956. In October 1957, the mountain management and infrastructure team was established, and he became the captain. In Zhujia Ping, six miles away from Niujia Ping, there was a girl named Xie Wenfeng, who was a member of this infrastructure team. In the process of harnessing mountains and rivers, Xie Wenfeng learned more about Guo Xianglian and often approached this young man. Guo Xianglian also knew the girl's heart. From then on, the relationship between the two became closer. However, the key to the smooth union of this young couple lay with the woman's mother.

The cadres went to Xie Wenfeng's house and talked to her mother about this matter. When the mother heard that the man was from Niujia Ping, her heart turned cold. She said, "That place has had no water for generations. If you marry there, you will either die from exhaustion or be exhausted to death." The cadres repeatedly explained to her that the mountain could definitely be managed well, and the difficulty of getting drinking water could definitely be solved. She still didn't believe it and refused to agree to her daughter's marriage.

Xie Wenfeng had also told Guo Xianglian about her mother's concerns. Guo Xianglian, this young man, was very shy and finally blushed and said to Xie Wenfeng, "We must work harder and manage the mountain well so that the people in the whole village will not have to worry about water." Xie Wenfeng smiled understandingly. The members of the infrastructure team all knew about Guo Xianglian and Xie Wenfeng's marriage. Some people, like them, had their own concerns. For the sake of love and happiness, the labor efficiency of the infrastructure team led by Guo Xianglian was particularly high. The infrastructure team, composed of more than 90 people, fought hard for 17 days in heavy rain and snow on the mountain, which was 15 miles long from east to west, and completed the mountain management task. Then, they dug several reservoirs around Niujia Ping Village. The water that seeped out became spring water, and the problem of drinking water for the whole village was also solved.

"We must help Guo Xianglian and Xie Wenfeng accomplish this major event!"

"Dig a reservoir in front of Guo Xianglian's door!"

"Let Xie Wenfeng have water as soon as she goes out!"

The young people of the infrastructure team started working together and did it for two days, digging a 400-cubic-meter reservoir in front of Guo Xianglian's house.

The mother finally came to Niujia Ping in person. She saw that a large amount of water had been stored in the pools around the village. Every household had a vegetable garden, full of green melons and vegetables. Women were washing clothes by the pool, and men were carrying water a few dozen steps away. The doubts in her heart were dispelled all at once.

In this way, in the spring of this year, Guo Xianglian and Xie Wenfeng formed a happy couple, and now they are working together in this Niujia Ping with mountains and water.

People who are enthusiastic about socialist construction will never be satisfied with the status quo. Now, the people of the Xiawei Commune are strengthening the protection and management of existing projects on the one hand, giving full play to the effectiveness of the projects, and striving for a bumper autumn harvest; on the other hand, they are holding high the red banner and continuing to move forward to high standards of water and soil conservation!

    富饶的山区  英雄的人们
    治山治水的一面红旗——下位人民公社
    位于革命老根据地沂蒙山区的山东沂水县下位人民公社，在过去几年水土保持工作的基础上，苦战了一年多，征服了穷山恶水，基本改变了山区面貌。这里现在是：绿树成荫，水满库塘，农业丰收，六畜兴旺。
        困难挡不住英雄汉
    下位人民公社包括四十二个村。在十八万六千九百三十亩的总面积上，有大小山头二百六十个，大小河流十三道，小山沟一千多道。山上树木本来就不多，战争期间又几乎被敌伪伐尽，水土流失十分严重。稍有大雨就山洪暴发，沙石俱下；几天不下雨，就发生干旱。穷山恶水，使农业产量低下，群众生活贫困。但是，有着光荣革命传统的老根据地人民，没有向穷山恶水屈服。他们把恶劣的自然环境变成了前进的动力，在党的领导下，全面展开了征服自然的大进军，决心把贫瘠的山区变成富饶美丽的乐园。
    开山劈岭，移河填沟，没有雄心壮志和冲天干劲是不行的。在治山治水过程中，公社党委通过查灾情，诉灾苦，算治山治水收益账；做出样子，组织现场参观；不断地总结评比，表扬先进等方法，教育启发社员自觉地参加治山治水。他们把一千二百余名精干的青壮年组成常年治山基建队，划片包干，包打山头。在农事间隙，男女老少齐上山，实行短期突击。一年多以来，常年基建队转战在各个山头，不论是朔风凛冽寒气逼人的隆冬数九天，还是烈日炎炎使人喘不过气来的酷夏；不论是风天，雨天，雪天，他们一直坚持战斗。
    公社党委书记王恒全是社员公认的领导治山模范。他终日爬山越岭，边勘测，边设计，边劳动，边传授技术。在严寒的深冬，他腰带干粮，冒着大风大雪，朝出夜归。短短几个月的时间，他几乎跑遍了每个山头，踏遍了每一条山沟。去年在试验运用水能时，反复钻研，终于创制成功水打磨模型，为大搞水利综合利用打响了第一炮。
    共产党员赵文华，在大战牛角崮中，率领一百零八名队员包治前山坡，苦战了十八天，提前完成任务。在岩石上修水池没有炸药，他就领导着队员用锤打镐头，在岩石上起缝，再插上杠子掀；缺少抬石头的工具，他们就去背。
    在治山过程中，全社最高出勤达到一万一千人，占总人口的60％，涌现出模范人物七百五十多名。
    就这样，他们苦干了一年多，到今年6月为止，治好大小山头八十六个，治好支沟毛沟三百五十余条，筑各种工程五千九百四十八座，修建库、塘、池、泉九百一十七个，筑拦河坝三十八道，共可蓄水六百五十五万公方。这些工程如果全部利用起来，就可使全社70％的耕地（共耕地六万零六百多亩）水利化，整理梯田三万七千亩，造林十余万亩。这些工程总共可以控制水土流失面积九十六平方公里，占全部水土流失面积88.4％。同时，由于土壤渗水量增加，地下水位提高，出现了七十一个新山泉；原有的四十八个小山泉，泉水比过去加旺变成了大泉；有八十道干沟，变成了清水长流。从此，沉睡多年的荒山苏醒了！行凶作恶的洪水驯服了！
    找到了治理沙、石山的途径
    征服穷山恶水不仅要苦干，还得靠巧干。下位人民公社在治山治水过程中，在工程项目、勘测设计和施工等方面，都有许多创造。
    全面治理荒山，遇到的第一个难题，是不会勘测设计，不懂工程的修建方法。这时，中共沂水县委就帮助公社党委先做出样子。公社党委书记王恒全带领治山积极分子，在河南技术员的帮助下，在牛角崮山上边学习、边勘测、边设计、边施工。接着就举办训练班，培养了一批技术人材。在一年多的实践中，全社有一百多名干部积极分子学会了简单的勘测设计技术，其中有几十人掌握了全套治山工程的规划、勘测、设计技术，大大加快了治山进度。
    如何全面治理沙、石山，这又是一个难题。根据上级党的正确方针，结合自己的经验，经过实践、研究，再实践、再研究，终于因地制宜地运用与发展了河南禹县的治山经验，创造与改进了多种工程项目。如沙石山上草木极少、土层极薄的地方，不适宜修建鱼鳞坑，他们就研究创造了围山拦沙墙。在坡度较缓，上边是光石崖，不能搞鱼鳞坑、水平沟，下面梯田又多，必须修建工程拦蓄洪水保护梯田的地方，他们就研究创造出围山连环蓄水池。他们还创造了在山坡引洪渠里修连环跌水池，使截拦的山水顺渠流向沟底塘坝水库时，由急变缓，减少了对沙土的冲刷。为增加已植林木的成活率，他们还创造了有蓄水功能的育林穴。原来的鱼鳞坑遇到大雨山洪漫溢很容易坍塌，他们就创造出鱼鳞坑带溢洪口，不管落雨多大，坑内存水总不超过可能容量。依靠集体的智慧和创造，下位人民公社已经找到了一套完整的治山治水方法。
      农林牧副渔五业齐开花
    征服荒山恶水刚刚一年多，下位人民公社就出现了农业丰收、六畜兴旺的繁荣景象。
    走进下位公社的田野，到处都可以听到淙淙的流水声。水库里，河坝里，山泉里，塘坝里蓄满的水，顺着一道一道的环山渠道，缓缓地流向田间。今年，全社二万一千亩地瓜，比去年提早了半个月栽种，每块地每棵秧苗都浇足了水。今春，全社小麦水浇面积占80％以上。由于播种适时，水浇面积扩大，土层加厚，肥效提高，1958年农业空前丰收，平均亩产粮（地瓜折算在内）五百斤，比1957年增加了193％。今年夏季，全社一万三千亩小麦平均亩产量比1958年又增长66％。
    随着自然条件的改善，社员们争取农业大丰收的信心更强了。今年7月中旬以来，这里没有降过透雨，作物发生干旱。于是，山泉水井齐利用，水库塘坝都放水，六天内全社就浇地一万一千余亩。
    夏天是水多草茂的季节，也是牲畜放牧的好时光。下位人民公社的山坡上、山沟旁，到处是一群群体壮膘肥的牛、羊、猪。今年以来，下位人民公社的家畜发展的特别快。全社共养羊四千六百六十三只，牛九百八十七头，猪七千一百九十八头，比去年都增加40％到50％。各种牲畜的繁殖率比往年大大提高。今年上半年全社二百八十五头母牛个个受胎，已生的一百三十四头小牛都体格健壮。猪的育肥期也缩短了，出售数量迅速增加。据收购部门统计，1958年在这里收购肥猪一千七百头，今年上半年收购一千一百八十头。1958年一季全社羊毛收入二千八百元，今年一季收入四千八百元。另外全社还养鸡六万五千只，养鸭一千一百只，养鹅四百一十只，养家兔一万四千八百只，都是羽毛丰满、体壮膘肥。同时还养鱼二百一十六万尾，种藕二十亩，这是过去根本没有的事情。今年栽的五万棵果树、二十万棵桑树，也都生长良好。其他如养蜂、养蝎、药材等生产也有发展。
    水力代人力，又快又省工
    在这里，水，不仅是按照人的意志，环绕着高山峻岭，顺着自流渠道，灌溉着一道一道的梯田；并且在各方面听人使唤，为人民生活造福。
    过去，在这个山乡里，人们有时畏水如虎，有时却惜水如油。全社有八个村，除了汛期以外，每天都要爬山越岭，到来回六、七里地的方去担水。如今，不仅惜水如油的现象一去不复返了，而且有六个村吃上了自来水。
    水，还从各方面代替人们劳动。自从去年秋天，公社党委在下位村试制成功了冲击式水轮机以后，接着全社有水源的三十一个村，都先后安装了弹花机、轧花机、鼓风机、铡草机、水打磨等十四种，一百一十八部水力动力工具。当我们走到下位村前时，只见水从崖上倾泻而下，冲撞着木轮旋转，一位姑娘一边做着针线，一边添着磨，洁白的面粉就飘飘而下。这样一盘最小型的磨，一天能磨一百七十多斤面粉，所用的劳力是非常轻微的。在下位村还建立了一座水力发电站（发电五瓩）。目前又在兴建一座可蓄水一千二百万公方的水库，并计划利用这个水库，建一个一百五十瓩的水力发电站。
      水，引渡着爱情和幸福
    过去，水源特别缺的几个村，姑娘们不愿嫁到那里。现在，这些村的青年人再也不必为找媳妇担忧了。牛家坪牛应新大爷告诉我们，他今年四十八岁了，从他记事起，这个六十几户的小村，就有十二个五十岁左右的老光棍。可是，最近一、二年内，新婚的青年夫妇就有七对。
    在牛家坪新婚的七对青年夫妇中，有一对就围绕着水的问题，经历了一段生动的故事：
    郭祥连，1956年从部队复员回家。1957年10月，建立治山基建队，他当了队长。离牛家坪六里的朱家坪，有个姑娘叫谢文凤，是这个基建队的队员。在治山治水中，谢文凤更多地了解了郭祥连，就经常接近这个青年小伙子。郭祥连也知道这个姑娘的心。从此，两个人的关系更亲近了。但是，这对青年要顺利的结合，关键在女方的母亲。
    干部们到谢文凤家里，向她的母亲谈了这件事。母亲一听说男方是牛家坪，心就冷了半截。她说：“那个地方老辈子没有水，嫁到那里，干不死，也累死了。”干部们反复向她说明，山一定能治好，吃水的困难一定能解决。她总是不信，对女儿的婚事不肯答应。
    母亲的顾虑，谢文凤也曾对郭祥连说过。郭祥连这个青年人十分腼腆，好不容易红着脸对谢文凤说：“咱们一定加劲干，把山治好，使全村的人用水不发愁。”谢文凤也会意地笑了。基建队的队员们，都知道郭祥连和谢文凤的婚事。有的人也和他们两个人一样，都有自己的心事。为了爱情和幸福，郭祥连领导的这个基建队，劳动效率特别高。由九十几个人组成的基建队，在东西长十五华里的山头上，在大雨大雪的天气里，苦战了十七天，完成了治山任务。接着又在牛家坪村的前后左右挖了几个蓄水池。蓄水渗出来就成了泉水，全村吃水的问题也解决了。
    “一定要帮助郭祥连和谢文凤成就这件大事！”
    “再到郭祥连的门前去挖个蓄水池！”
    “让谢文凤出门就是水！”
    基建队的青年们，你一言，我一语，一齐动手，干了两天，就在郭祥连的屋前挖了一个蓄水四百方的水池。
    母亲终于亲自到牛家坪来了。一看，村四周的水池里都蓄下了大量的水。家家户户都有了菜园，长满着绿油油的瓜菜。妇女们在池边洗衣服，男人就在离几十步远的地方担水。心里的疑虑一下子勾销了。
    就这样，在今年的春天，郭祥连和谢文凤结成了幸福的夫妻，现在他们共同劳动在这有山有水的牛家坪。
    对社会主义事业热情洋溢的人，永远不会满足现状。现在，下位公社的人们，正一面对已有的工程加强护养管理，充分发挥工程效能，争取秋季大丰收；一面高举红旗，继续向水土保持高标准前进！
