    Sixty Years a Beast of Burden, Ten Years a Human Being
    Deng Chumin

    I began the long trek of my life seventy years ago this October. I have experienced four historical periods: the late Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and the ten years since Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of all the ethnic groups in our country, solemnly proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Based on my personal experiences over the past sixty years, the people lived like beasts of burden in the old society. The revolutionary martyr Qu Qiubai vividly depicted the tragic scene of the late Qing Dynasty. He said that at that time, "The sky always frowned. If the sun still shone on the ground, it was always faint and thin. As for the moon, needless to say, she only occasionally showed half her face, using her pale eyes to look at this sinful world." (Qu Qiubai, "A Kind of Cloud") The great Mr. Lu Xun pointed out sharply that the social scene during the Northern Warlord period was "countless feasts of human flesh, large and small."

    During the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, the lives of the Chinese people were even more miserable. In particular, large numbers of revolutionaries and patriotic intellectuals were brutally murdered. In the Yuhuatai area of ​​Nanjing alone, hundreds of thousands of revolutionary patriots were buried! This is something I personally experienced and found shocking. This February, I returned to my hometown - Shishou County, Hubei Province. On the one hand, I saw the extremely happy, joyful and hardworking lives of the people in my hometown, and on the other hand, with admiration, I recalled Comrade Wang Changqing, who founded the revolutionary base in Shishou and served as the chairman of the Shishou Peasants' Association, and Comrade Deng Changyou, my sister, who served as the propaganda captain and member of the presidium of the Jiangbei Soviet of Shishou County, were both arrested and killed by the Chiang bandit gang in 1931. I couldn't help but burst into tears, feeling a pain that pierced my heart!

    In "that sinful world," the lives of revolutionary intellectuals were precarious, the vast majority of people lived like beasts of burden, and I struggled in it for a full sixty years!

    On October 1st, ten years ago, Chairman Mao solemnly announced the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the development of Chinese history and the lives of the vast majority of people underwent fundamental changes. Not only was the sinful semi-colonial and semi-feudal society and the fascist rule of Chiang and the US were buried forever, but also unprecedented great achievements were immediately made in socialist transformation and socialist construction. 650 million people stood up taller and more majestic! Workers are no longer beasts of burden for capitalists - they have become human beings; peasants are no longer slaves for landlords - they have become human beings; intellectuals not only have security in their lives, but also have a political status, and are taken care of in every way from birth, old age, illness and death. I am an old man who has been sick for ten years, but thanks to the care of the Party, I have gradually recovered my health and youth. In these ten years, I have personally witnessed the unprecedented improvement of our country's international status and the rapid development of domestic construction. In particular, I have seen the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and this year. Tens of millions of people went to the mountains to mine and produce iron and steel on a large scale, and tens of millions of people dug earth to open canals and build large-scale water conservancy projects. The first five-year plan was completed one year ahead of schedule, and the second five-year plan was completed three years ahead of schedule. The targets for several items such as raw coal, raw wood, raw salt, and grain were not completed three years ahead of schedule, but four years ahead of schedule last year, and we will catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products five years ahead of schedule, and greatly overfulfill the twelve-year agricultural development plan several years ahead of schedule. This makes me even more full of youthful vitality, and I can't wait to raise my arms, split open a mountain; stride out, run thousands of miles, and compete with the young lads! Now, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune movement have undoubtedly proved its correctness through practice. In the future great cause of socialist construction in our country, they will undoubtedly play a greater role! This has forever ended the history of inhuman life in our country for many centuries and opened a new era in the history of truly human life in our country. Comrade Khrushchev said that one day, "the era may be calculated from the day of the October Revolution." We can also take October 1st ten years ago as the new era in our country's history.

    My clumsy pen finds it difficult to find appropriate words to express the free, happy, friendly, mutual-aid, and joyful lives of the vast number of people and intellectuals in the new China, as well as their vigorous spirit like the rising sun, marching towards an infinitely great future! Last autumn, when the people's commune first appeared on our country's horizon, I visited the Shunyi District People's Commune in Beijing and wrote the following sentences:

    "...I seem to have returned to my own home, no, there are many problems in the old family. How about coming back, it depends on whether you have a future, the ancient Su Qin, once had a wife who would not cook, and a sister-in-law who would not weave. But this is the people's commune, this is the new collective. ...

      "Here are established public canteens, nurseries, happy homes...Here began the happy century of 'the young are cared for, the old are provided for, and the widowed and lonely are all supported.' This is the people's commune, this is the new collective.

      "650 million people are united tightly, you are me, I am you. Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are twisted into one rope, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industries, and fisheries are developed simultaneously, producing in peacetime, and killing enemies in wartime.

      "This is a fundamental change in the old relations of production, and the establishment of a new socialist ownership. This is a fundamental change in the old spiritual outlook, and the establishment of new moral qualities. What is written on its banner is: from 'distribution according to work' to 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs'."

    Facts show that the initial people's commune was full of strong vitality and a rich spring atmosphere!

    Our great motherland has ushered in an eternal spring. The spring breeze has opened up hundreds of flowers, turned the earth green, and brought the good news of the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959. In this atmosphere of boundless spring, red flags fluttering, the masses are excited, and the whole country is united, people's moods are comfortable, and people's lives are democratic. Great decade! Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line, we have not only built a material world of continuous leap forward, prosperity and affluence economically, but also built a spiritual world of national unity, democracy and harmony, full of joy and faith. This is the "evergreen motherland," this is the world of people! "Sixty years a beast of burden, ten years a human being," this is my indignant and heroic summary of my entire seventy years.

    When the people of the world are watching China, which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of liberation, and feeling happy, inspired and proud like us. Let the reactionary factions at home and abroad spread rumors and slander! Comrade Khrushchev said well, "No matter how fast a lie runs, it can never catch up with the truth." Let the right-leaning opportunists pour cold water on the masses! The people of our hot and evergreen motherland have no freezing winter in their hearts at all!

    六十年牛马十年人
    邓初民
    我开始人生长途跋涉，到今年10月整整七十年，经历了四个历史时期，即清末、北洋军阀、蒋介石集团统治时期以及我国各民族人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席庄严宣告人民中国成立的十年。
    根据我过去六十年的亲身经历，旧社会人民过的是牛马一般的生活。革命先烈瞿秋白曾生动而形象化地描绘过清末时代的悲惨景象。他说，那时“天总是皱着眉头。太阳如果还射到地面上，那也总是稀微的淡薄的。至于月亮那更不必说，她只是偶然露出半面，用她那惨淡的眼光，看一看这罪孽的人间。”（瞿秋白著：“一种云”）伟大的鲁迅先生更是一针见血地指出北洋军阀时期的社会景象是“大小无数的人肉筵席”。
    蒋介石集团统治时期，中国人民的生活就更悲惨了，特别是革命者和爱国知识分子大批地惨遭杀戮，单单南京雨花台一地就埋下了数以十万计的革命爱国者的尸骨！这也是我亲身经历、感到触目惊心的。今年2月我回到了我的故乡——湖北石首县。一面看到了故乡人民的极其幸福、欢乐和勤奋的生活，一面又怀着敬仰的心情回忆起在石首创立革命根据地，曾任石首农民协会主席的王长清同志和石首县江北苏维埃宣传队长兼主席团委员、我的胞姊邓昌友同志都是于1931年先后被蒋匪帮逮捕杀害的，不禁老泪纵横，痛彻肺肝！
    在“那罪孽的人间”，革命知识分子的生命是朝不保夕，广大人民过着牛马一般的生活，而我也在其中翻腾挣扎了整整六十年呵！
    十年前的10月1日，毛主席庄严宣告人民中国的成立，中国历史的发展和广大人民的生活就起了本质的变化。不但永远消灭了罪恶的半殖民地半封建社会和埋葬了蒋美的法西斯统治，并立即在社会主义改造和社会主义建设方面取得了史无前例的伟大成就。六亿五千万人民更高大雄伟的站起来了！工人已不再为资本家做牛马——做了人；农民已不再为地主做奴隶——做了人；知识分子不但生活上有保障，而且政治上有地位，生老病死的照顾，无微不至。我就是久病十年的老人，由于党的关怀得以逐日恢复健康和青春。在这十年中，我亲眼看到我国国际地位的空前提高，国内建设的飞快发展，特别看到了1958年和今年的大跃进，几千万人上山采矿，大炼钢铁，几千万人掘土开渠，大兴水利，第一个五年计划提前一年完成，第二个五年计划提前三年完成。而原煤、原木、原盐、粮食几项指标，却不是提前三年而是提前四年在去年就完成了，还要提前五年左右在主要工业品产量方面赶上英国，提前若干年大大超额完成十二年农业发展纲要。这就使得我更加充满了青春的活力，也恨不得举起双臂，辟开一座山；迈开两腿，跑上万里路，来与青年小伙子们比比干劲！现在，总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动，已经通过实践肯定无疑地证明了它的正确性，在今后我国社会主义建设的伟大事业中，它们无疑将会发挥更伟大的作用！这样就永远结束了我国许多世纪以来的非人生活的历史，开辟了我国真正人的历史的新纪元。赫鲁晓夫同志说，可能有一天，“纪元会从十月革命那一天算起”。我们也可以把十年前的10月1日那一天作为我国历史的新纪元了。
    我的笨拙的笔，很难找到适当的字句来表达广大人民和知识分子在新中国的自由、幸福、友爱、互助、欢乐的生活，以及他们那种朝着无限伟大的前程迈进的如旭日初升的朝气蓬勃的气象！去年秋天，人民公社刚出现在我国地平线上，我去参观了北京顺义区人民公社，写下了如下的句子：
    “……我似乎回到了自己家里，不，旧家庭也有很多问题。回来怎样，还要看你有没有出息，古苏秦，就曾经妻不为炊，嫂不下机。但这里是人民公社，这里是新的集体。……
      “这里建立了公共食堂，托儿所，幸福院……这里开始了‘少有所长，老有所归，鳏寡孤独皆有所养’的幸福世纪。这里是人民公社，这里是新的集体。
      “六亿五千万人民团结紧，你就是我，我就是你。工农商学兵，拧成一股绳，农林牧副渔，同时并举，平时生产，战时杀敌。
      “这是旧的生产关系的根本改变，新的社会主义所有制的确立。这是旧的精神面貌的根本变革，新的道德品质的确立。它的旗帜上写着的是：从‘按劳分配’到‘各尽所能，各取所需’。”
    事实说明初期的人民公社就充满了强大生命力和浓郁的春天气息！
    我们的伟大的祖国，已经迎来了一个永恒的春天。春风吹开了百花，吹绿了大地，吹来了1959年继续大跃进的喜讯。在这春色无边，红旗招展，群情振奋，上下一心的战斗气氛中，人们的心情是舒畅的，人们的生活是民主的。伟大的十年呵！在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，不仅在经济上已为我们构筑了一个不断跃进、繁荣富庶的物质世界，同时，也为我们构筑了一个全民团结、民主和睦、充满愉快和信念的精神世界。这就是“常春的祖国”，这就是人的世界！“六十年牛马十年人”，这就是我整整七十年的激愤而又豪迈的概括和总结。
    当全世界人民都在注视着正在庆祝解放十周年的中国，和我们一样感到欢欣鼓舞和骄傲的时候。让国内外反动派去造谣诬蔑吧！赫鲁晓夫同志说得好“谎言跑得再快，也永远追赶不上真理。”让右倾机会主义分子去向群众泼冷水吧！我们热气腾腾常春的祖国的人们心里是根本没有冷冰冰的冬天的！
