Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, August 31st: The communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party have given the iron and steel workers of Benxi infinite strength. All employees of the company have put forward new guarantees: to complete the annual pig iron production plan ten days ahead of schedule and to complete the annual steel ingot production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule.

In recent days, all employees of the company have not only completed the production plan on a shift-by-shift and day-by-day basis, but have also created many new records in succession. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces has been greatly improved; from the 26th to the 28th, the twenty-four-hour iron output per cubic meter of effective blast furnace volume increased from 2.457 before the 26th to 2.519, and the quality of pig iron reached 100%. After listening to the Party's battle call, the workers of Class C in the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of Benxi Steel Company immediately tried every means to shorten the steelmaking time, and the output of the shift increased by 36 tons of steel compared with the previous day. The workers of Class B were even more unwilling to be outdone after taking over the shift, and did not relax for a single minute or second. The output of the shift increased by 48 tons compared with the previous day, breaking the new record of Class C again. As a result, the entire workshop produced more than 110 tons of high-quality steel than the previous day, and the quality of steel reached 100%, creating a new record of high yield and high quality since the beginning of this year. The next day, the rolling mill of this factory also created a new record for daily rolled steel, which was 15% higher than the highest daily output since the beginning of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, August 31st: The employees of Tangshan Steel Plant have been fighting hard in August and September, and the output has been increasing day by day. By the 29th, the plant had completed the August production plan for steel ingots and steel products more than two days ahead of schedule. Compared with the same period in July, the output of steel ingots increased by 8,672 tons. The qualified rate of steel ingots reached 98.59%. The amount of pig iron used per ton of steel produced was 95.15 kg lower than planned. On the 29th, all employees of the plant held a oath-taking rally to warmly respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and resolutely strive to win more steel ingots in the next four months than in the previous eight months, given the completion of workshop equipment maintenance; the annual output of steel products should be about doubled that of last year.

Since August, the steelmaking and rolling workers, auxiliary personnel, and office cadres of Tangshan Steel Plant have launched a vigorous socialist labor competition, and new records have been constantly emerging in various workshops. By the 27th, the plant had created more than 30 new production records that had never been seen since the beginning of this year. Many leading cadres often go to workshops and teams to study and solve key problems in production together with the workers, and strengthen ideological and political work. Zhang Junchuan, the Party Branch Secretary of the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop, helped the 3rd steelmaking team to change the long-term backward situation of production after working on the spot with the team. This team won the workshop's winning red flag in the evaluation in the third week of August.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 31st: The national converter red banner—the No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant—had completed the state plan of producing 22,500 tons of steel in August two and a half days ahead of schedule by 12:00 noon on the 29th.

In August, the production level of this workshop reached a new peak: the utilization coefficient of converters averaged 32 tons in 28 days, which was 6.25 tons higher than the national record of 25.75 tons created in July; the qualified rate of steel increased from an average of 97.38% in July to 98.5% in August.

After the expansion of the No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant during the Great Leap Forward last year, it has become a larger workshop with four six-ton converter production equipment. Since the beginning of this year, the employees of this workshop have continued to adopt the method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and have successively overcome the "pig iron furnace technical barrier" and the "converter furnace age barrier," and have creatively researched and successfully developed the "ground furnace baking" method. In the past, each furnace had to be baked continuously for eight hours. After adopting the "ground furnace baking" method, new furnaces are baked before being placed on the furnace seat. After being placed on the furnace seat, they only need to be baked for another two hours before steel can be made, which greatly improves the utilization rate of converter equipment.

In July, this workshop mobilized the masses to summarize the work experience of the previous stage, revised technical operating procedures, and improved the post responsibility system. In August, all work has been further developed. The leading cadres in the workshop, on the one hand, focused on pre-shift production inspection and production activity analysis, and told the workers the existing and possible problems in the current production, so that the masses had a clear understanding; on the other hand, they worked with the shift and solved various problems encountered in production with the workers in front of the furnace to eliminate various unfavorable factors for production. The cooperation between shifts, furnaces, and sections in the workshop has also been greatly strengthened compared with the past. The workers of Class C put forward the slogan "Take over the shift without conditions, and hand over the shift to satisfy people," and paid attention to creating conditions for the next shift every day. On the 15th, they not only produced 40 furnaces of steel in their own shift, but also seized the time to blow up two furnaces of steel and hand them over to Class A before leaving the shift, and also put good molten iron in three furnaces for Class A, so that Class A smoothly produced six furnaces of steel in the first hour after taking over the shift, and as a result created the highest record of 48 furnaces of steel per shift. Due to the strengthening of cooperation and production management, the workshop has seen a situation in which the production of three shifts is advancing simultaneously.

    本溪加快夺铁夺钢步伐
    保证分别提前十天和半月完成全年炼铁炼钢任务
    唐钢和上钢三厂第一转炉车间提前完成八月计划
    据新华社本溪31日电　党的八届八中全会公报和决议给本溪钢铁工人增添无限的力量。全公司职工提出了新的保证：提前十天完成全年生铁生产计划，提前十五天完成全年钢锭生产计划。
    近日来，公司全体职工不仅按班按日地完成生产计划，而且接连创造了许多新纪录。高炉利用系数又大大提高了；26日到28日，每一立米的高炉有效容积二十四小时的产铁量，已由26日前的二点四五七提高到二点五一九，生铁质量达到100％。本溪钢铁公司钢厂第一炼钢车间丙班工人收听了党的战斗号召之后，立即想尽一切办法缩短炼钢时间，当班就比前一天增产了三十六吨钢。乙班工人接班之后更不示弱，不放松一分一秒钟时间，班产量比前一天增产四十八吨，又刷新了丙班的新纪录。结果，全车间比前一天多炼优质钢一百一十多吨，钢的质量达到100％，创造了今年以来的高产优质新纪录。第二天，这个工厂的轧钢车间，又创造
  日轧钢材的新纪录，比今年以来最高日产量还高15％。
    新华社唐山31日电　唐山钢厂职工奋战8、9月，产量日日上升。到29日，全厂已提前两天多完成了8月份的钢锭和钢材生产计划。与7月同期比较，多产钢锭八千六百七十二吨。钢锭合格率达到98.59％。每炼一吨钢所用生铁，比
  计划降低九十五点一五公斤。29日，全厂职工举行了誓师大会，热烈响应党中央的伟大号召，坚决要在今后四个月内，在车间设备检修完毕的情况下，夺得比前八个月还要多的钢锭；全年钢材产量要超过去年一倍左右。
    8月份以来，唐山钢厂的炼钢轧钢工人、辅助人员和科室干部，如火如荼地开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，新纪录不断在各个车间出现。到27日，全厂创造了三十多项今年以来从未有过的生产新纪录。许多领导干部经常到车间、班组去跟工人一起研究解决生产中的关键问题，和加强思想政治工作。第一炼钢车间党总支书记张俊川到现场跟班劳动后，帮助炼钢第三班改变了生产长期落后的局面，这个班在8月第三周评比中获得车间的优胜红旗。
    新华社上海31日电　全国转炉红旗——上海第三钢铁厂第一转炉车间，到29日上午十二时止，已提前两天半完成了8月份产钢二万二千五百吨的国家计划。
    8月份，这个车间的生产水平又达到了新的高峰：转炉利用系数，二十八天中平均达到三十二吨，比7月份创造的全国最高纪录二十五点七五吨，高出了六点二五吨；钢的合格率，从7月份平均97.38％上升到8月份的98.5％。
    上钢三厂第一转炉车间在去年大跃进中扩建后，已成为一个具有四座六吨转炉生产设备的较大车间。今年以来，这个车间的职工继续采取领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的办法，接连攻克了“化铁炉技术关”、“转炉炉龄关”，并且创造性地研究成功了“平地烘炉”的办法。过去每只炉子要连续烘八小时，采用“平地烘炉”的办法后，新炉子上炉座前都经过烘炼，上炉座后只要再烘炼两小时就可以炼钢，大大提高了转炉设备的利用率。
    这个车间在7月份发动群众总结了前一阶段的工作经验，修订技术操作规程和健全岗位责任制。8月份，各项工作更有所发展。车间里的领导干部一面抓紧班前生产检查和生产活动分析工作，把当前生产中存在的和可能出现的问题，告诉工人群众，使群众心中有数；一面跟班劳动，在炉前和工人一同解决生产中遇到的种种问题，消除各种对生产不利的因素。车间班与班、炉与炉、工段与工段之间的协作也比过去大为加强。丙班工人提出：
  “接班不讲条件，交班使人满意”的口号后，天天注意做好为下班创造条件的工作。15日，他们不仅在自己班上炼出了四十炉钢，并且抓紧时间，在下班前把两炉钢吹起来交给甲班，又给甲班放好了三炉钢的铁水，使甲班接班后第一个小时就顺利地炼出了六炉钢，结果创造了班炼四十八炉钢的最高纪录。由于加强协作和生产管理，这个车间出现三个班生产齐头并进的局面。
