Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The fourth round of the basketball finals for the First National Games was held today. So far, the Beijing and PLA men's and women's teams and the Sichuan men's team have all won four games in a row, maintaining their undefeated record. The Sichuan and Guangdong women's teams have three wins and one loss.

    The women's basketball game between Shanghai and Sichuan was very close. The Shanghai women's team is a renowned team with seven athletes, while the Sichuan women's team is a tenacious and brave new force. At the beginning of the game, the Sichuan women's team played zone defense, giving full play to the role of their tall center, actively grabbing rebounds, and scoring repeatedly with mid-range shots, leading the way and putting pressure on the Shanghai women's team. At the end of the first half, the Shanghai women's team was six points behind Sichuan. In the first ten minutes of the second half, the Sichuan team continued to play proactively. Seeing the situation was not good, the Shanghai team changed to full-court press and fast breaks. This move was very effective, and by the thirteenth minute, they had caught up to thirty-four all. Afterwards, the Sichuan women's team adapted to the situation and also changed to full-court press, and the score once again approached the Shanghai team, but in the last five minutes, they made more mistakes and committed more fouls, and finally lost to the Shanghai women's team by a score of thirty-nine to forty-four.

    In the battle between the Beijing women's team and the Hebei women's team, after several seesaws, the Beijing team only won the victory with a burst of fast breaks in the last four minutes. At that time, the Hebei team had led by ten points with a score of fifty-one to forty-one. Yang Jie, Li Shaofen, and Wang Xiafei of the Beijing women's team scored ten points in total with shots and free throws, tying the score at fifty-one all. Taking advantage of the situation, the Beijing team pressed the full court, and the Hebei team's formation suddenly became a little flustered. Li Shaofen, Yang Jie, and Hu Yingxin of the Beijing team rushed into the opponent's basket in three or two steps, and Hu Yingxin raised her hand and scored again, taking the lead with fifty-three to fifty-one. In the end, the Beijing team's offense became even more fierce, and they finally won with a score of sixty-two to fifty-five.

    The PLA men's team also won against the Jiangsu team by seven points after fierce competition. The score was seventy-six to eighty-three.

    The results of the other nine games today are: Men's teams: Beijing team won against Hebei team (ninety-one to seventy), Sichuan team won against Shanghai team (seventy-four to seventy-one), Heilongjiang team won against Guangdong team (ninety-one to seventy-eight), Jilin team won against Hubei team (ninety-seven to forty-four), Liaoning team won against Shaanxi team (one hundred and five to sixty-two).

    上海和四川两队的女子篮球赛打得难解难分。上海女队是拥有七员运动健将驰名球坛的劲旅，四川女队是顽强勇敢的一支新军。比赛开始后，四川女队打联防，充分发挥高个中锋的作用、积极夺取篮板球，中距离投篮连连得分，一路领先，压得上海女队喘不过气来。上半场结束时，上海女队净输四川队六分。下半场前十分四川队仍然打得主动。上海队见势不妙，改打全场紧逼、快攻。这一着很厉害，到十三分时，就赶到三十四平。以后四川女队随机应变，也改打全场紧逼，得分又一度接近上海队，但在最后五分钟内失误、犯规较多，终以三十九比四十四败给上海女队。
    北京女队和河北女队一战，双方经过几次拉锯，北京队在最后四分钟一阵快攻才夺得胜利。当时河北队曾以五十一比四十一领先十分，北京女队杨洁、李少芬、王霞飞连投带罚，共得十分，扳成五十一平。北京队乘势全场紧逼，河北队阵脚顿时有点慌乱，北京队李少芬、杨洁和胡英信三脚两步又冲进对方篮下，胡英信一扬手又应声入篮，以五十三比五十一超出。最后，北京队攻势更加凌厉，终以六十二比五十五胜。
    解放军男队也是通过激烈的争夺，才赢了江苏队七分。比数是七十六比八十三。
