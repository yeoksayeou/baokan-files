Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Sixth Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second National People's Congress was held this afternoon to discuss the Sino-Indian border issue. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Zhu De.

Premier Zhou Enlai made a report on the Sino-Indian border issue at the meeting. In addition to discussing the historical background and current situation of the Sino-Indian border issue, he focused on clarifying the position, attitude, and policy adopted by the Chinese government on the Sino-Indian border issue, and submitted it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

Premier Zhou said that the recent tension in the Sino-Indian border issue was entirely due to the deliberate actions of some individuals in India with ulterior motives. They used some border disputes to launch a new anti-China movement, viciously attacking China and slandering China as "aggressing" against India. Regrettably, the Indian government has also groundlessly accused China, putting pressure on China in military, diplomatic, and public opinion aspects, attempting to impose India's one-sided views on the border issue on China. For several months, China has maintained the greatest restraint and patience for the sake of Sino-Indian friendship, but this has not elicited the due response from Indian officials. Therefore, we have no choice but to bring the Sino-Indian border issue to the solemn Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to make a public response to the unfriendly attacks from the Indian side.

In his report, Premier Zhou reiterated the Chinese government's position, attitude, and policy on handling the Sino-Indian border issue as stated in his letter to Nehru on September 8. He said: The Chinese government has always maintained that China and India should consider the historical background and current actual situation, and comprehensively resolve the border issue between the two countries through friendly consultations in a prepared and step-by-step manner based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Before this, as a temporary measure, both sides should maintain the long-existing state of the border without unilaterally changing this situation through actions, let alone the use of force. For some disputes, local and temporary agreements can also be reached through negotiations to ensure peace and tranquility on the border and maintain the friendship between the two countries. Premier Zhou said that he believed the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress would support the government's position and policy on the Sino-Indian border issue.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke in detail about the historical background and current actual situation of the Sino-Indian border issue. He pointed out that the Sino-Indian border issue is a complex issue left over from history. The approximately 2,000-kilometer border line between the two countries has never been formally demarcated, nor have there been any negotiations and surveys for a comprehensive resolution of the border issue. Therefore, there is no reason to require the Chinese government to accept the Indian government's one-sided claims regarding the Sino-Indian border. As for the so-called McMahon Line, it is a product of British imperialism's aggression against Tibet and has never been recognized by any central government in China, so it is definitely illegal.

Premier Zhou then pointed out that even if the entire Sino-Indian border has not been demarcated, as long as both sides maintain the long-existing status quo of the border, China and India can still coexist peacefully very well. The situation over the past decade has proven this. During this period, in the western section of the Sino-Indian border, there were indeed incidents of Indian troops and administrative personnel intruding into or occupying Chinese territory. However, because the Chinese government has always handled these incidents with a friendly attitude, these incidents have not caused tension in Sino-Indian relations. Recently, in the eastern section of the Sino-Indian border, although the border incidents were entirely caused by Indian troops crossing the border and occupying Chinese territory, and crossing north of the so-called McMahon Line, the Indian side has made a great clamor, creating tension in Sino-Indian relations. What is the reason for this? Obviously, some people in India deliberately wanted to create tension between China and India again after the Tibetan rebellion, undermining Sino-Indian friendship, and the Indian government also attempted to take this opportunity to put pressure on the Chinese government, forcing China to accept India's one-sided claims on the border issue and revise the map according to India's will. Premier Zhou emphasized that this kind of attempt to impose on others will never be realized. The Chinese government never imposes on others, and in order to maintain Sino-Indian friendship and the Five Principles, firmly opposes doing so.

Premier Zhou finally said that China and India are two major Asian countries with a total population of over one billion. We have common interests and responsibilities in maintaining world peace, especially Asian peace. Our two countries have a long-standing traditional friendship and are the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Disagreements between the two countries regarding the border issue, even if they are only partial disputes, should be resolved fairly and reasonably through friendly negotiations, and should not take measures that may lead to conflict.

After Premier Zhou Enlai's report, the meeting proceeded with discussions.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Sixth Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress began discussions after Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Sino-Indian border issue. The members fully agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's report and fully supported the solemn position and consistent policy adopted by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue and the border situation. They pointed out that this position and policy expressed the firm will of the people of the whole country to defend the sacred territory of the motherland and the sincere desire to maintain Sino-Indian friendship. The members unanimously expressed their indignation at the anti-China movement launched by some individuals in India with ulterior motives and the unreasonable accusations against China by Indian government officials in their speeches.

Li Jishen:

We will never recognize the so-called McMahon Line. The tense situation on the Sino-Indian border is entirely created by India.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, expressed his firm support for the correct position adopted by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue and the border situation in his speech. Li Jishen said, "We will never recognize the so-called McMahon Line." He pointed out, "The tense situation on the border is entirely created by India."

Li Jishen said that Prime Minister Nehru has gone a bit too far. The McMahon Line, which the Indian government insists on, is a product of Britain's implementation of its policy of aggression against China's Tibet region. This line once aroused the infinite indignation of the Chinese people and has never been recognized by any central government in China, so it is definitely illegal. Now the Indian government is asking the Chinese government to formally recognize the situation created by Britain's aggression against China's Tibet region, which is completely unreasonable.

Li Jishen said that since the rebellion in China's Tibet region, the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border has been entirely created by India. He expressed regret over the recent accusations against China by Indian Prime Minister Nehru. He said that Nehru's remarks and actions can only make friends who care about Sino-Indian friendly relations feel pained and make reactionaries who sow discord in Sino-Indian friendship and create tension rejoice.

Li Jishen said that our government has always attached importance to Sino-Indian friendship and the cause of peace, and has always adopted an extremely restrained attitude towards the Sino-Indian border issue. He advised the Indian government to immediately rein in its horses before it's too late. He said that our government never infringes on others and will never tolerate infringement by others. He hoped that the Indian government would not be fooled by the imperialists and would adopt a wise attitude to resolve the Sino-Indian border disputes through peaceful negotiations based on the Five Principles. This is in the interests of the people of China and India and is also the hope of peace-loving people all over the world.

Shen Junru:

Warning to the Indian government authorities: If the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border continues to develop, if the conspiracies of the imperialists and their agents in India succeed, it will be detrimental to India first and foremost.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, solemnly warned the Indian government authorities: If the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border continues to develop, if the conspiracies of the imperialists and their agents in India succeed, it will be detrimental to India first and foremost.

Shen Junru said that the people of China and India have lived together in friendship since ancient times, but recently Indian officials, parliamentarians, right-wing parties, and the newspapers they control have been clamoring about the Sino-Indian border issue after the Tibetan rebellion, and have done their utmost to fabricate rumors and slander China, which the Chinese people cannot tolerate.

He said, Mr. Nehru, one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, instead of reflecting on the Indian army's intrusion into our border, slanders our country for "aggression". Isn't this turning right and wrong upside down?

Shen Junru pointed out that a group of people in India have always been creating divisive conspiracies, undermining the friendly relations between China and India, and trying to drag India into the quagmire of military blocs. Their purpose is to continue to create tension in Asia and turn India into an imperialist military base. Shen Junru asked: "Can Mr. Nehru, who advocates a policy of non-alignment, be completely unwary and allow this kind of conspiracy to continue?"

Shen Junru said that since the founding of New China ten years ago, it has always adhered to a peaceful policy in international affairs. But if anyone thinks that our peaceful foreign policy is weak and can be bullied, then they are very wrong.

Huang Yanpei:

To say that our territory is Indian territory, and that the Indian army's cross-border provocations are our "aggression" against India, isn't this reversing black and white, violating the Five Principles?

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that he was very surprised that Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently affirmed in the Indian Parliament that the McMahon Line is the border line between China and India. He said that to say that our territory is Indian territory, and that the Indian army's cross-border provocations are our "aggression" against India, isn't this reversing black and white, violating the Five Principles?

Huang Yanpei said that from 1913 to 1914, it was shortly after our Xinhai Revolution. At that time, I was participating in political activities, and I knew that the Chinese government at that time had never recognized the "McMahon Line." Not only has our country never recognized it, but even the British Henry Twynam, who served as the governor of Assam State in northeastern India twenty years ago, said: "The so-called McMahon Line on the Sino-Indian border has never been recognized." And the Indian government wants China to accept this illegal boundary, which is entirely inheriting Britain's long-standing policy of aggression against China's Tibet region, and it is by no means what a country that has suffered from imperialist aggression for a long time should do.

Huang Yanpei then rebuked the slanderous remarks of the Indian reactionaries who viciously attacked our country for infringing on the territory of other countries. He pointed out that the statements made by the heads of the governments of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim to refute the rumors completely exposed these lies. He said that these slanderous actions are despicable.

Huang Yanpei said that our country respects the territorial sovereignty of friendly countries, but also requires the other party to respect our territorial sovereignty in the same way. Therefore, we resolutely demand that the Indian government immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border and restore the long-existing state of the border between the two countries to ease the current tension, and not be fooled by the imperialist attempt to sow discord in Sino-Indian relations.

Guo Moruo:

It is very surprising that Prime Minister Nehru is actually defending British imperialism and slandering us as "Chinese imperialism."

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his speech that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on September 8 and today's report are justified, confident, and forthright. However, Prime Minister Nehru gave a completely opposite answer. He actually defended British imperialism and slandered us as "Chinese imperialism," which is very surprising.

Guo Moruo said that the history of British imperialism and other imperialisms invading China for nearly a hundred years is something that our generation has deeply experienced since childhood. He questioned, why is Mr. Nehru defending British imperialism?

Guo Moruo said that the Indian people are truly friendly to the Chinese people. They are wholeheartedly chanting "India and China are brothers," unlike the "Goodbye India and China" shouted by some anti-China elements.

He emphasized that the few rampant anti-China gentlemen on the Indian side should wake up. It is not too late to turn back. Our government and people will always adhere firmly to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We sincerely hope that the Indian people will resolutely oppose the conspiracies of the imperialists and their agents who sow discord in Sino-Indian relations, and urge the Indian government to work together to maintain Sino-Indian friendship and the cause of peace.

Liu Ningyi:

Solemnly warn the Indian expansionists that the powerful Chinese people resolutely do not infringe on others, and will never allow others to infringe on our country.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, expressed his firm support for the solemn position taken by our government on the Sino-Indian border issue and expressed great indignation at India's acts of encroaching on Chinese territory.

Liu Ningyi said that some people in India have recently created Sino-Indian border incidents, setting off a new anti-China wave, especially repeatedly demonstrating in front of the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in India, and slandering our country and our leaders. The vast number of workers in our country cannot but express a solemn protest against such arrogant provocations!

Liu Ningyi said that when our China was bullied in the past, we never recognized the so-called "McMahon Line". How could our government recognize this illegal boundary today when the Chinese people have stood up? Obviously, this shameful attempt will always be in vain.

Liu Ningyi solemnly warned the Indian expansionists that the era when the Chinese people were bullied is gone forever. The powerful Chinese people who have stood up resolutely do not infringe on others, but will never allow others to infringe on our country. We hope that the Indian government will adopt a wise attitude, return to the position of the Five Principles, and immediately take measures to withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border, restore the long-existing state of the border between the two countries, and ease the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border. Any practice based on one-sided claims and imposing on others will not only fail to achieve results, but will only damage the friendship between the two countries, make enemies happy and alienate relatives, and will be opposed by the Chinese people and the Indian people, as well as by peace-loving people all over the world.

Chen Shutong:

Our government values maintaining Sino-Indian friendship, but maintaining the traditional friendship between China and India is by no means a one-sided matter for us.

Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: This Sino-Indian border incident is a provocative act by India against our country, and all the people of our country are very indignant. He said that India was also subjected to aggression by British imperialism before its independence. Now Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian government insist on saying that the aggressive conspiracy of British imperialism at that time is a fait accompli. Does this attitude conform to the Five Principles that Prime Minister Nehru has always advocated? Prime Minister Nehru is one of the founders of the Five Principles, but he has adopted a tolerant attitude towards the actions of some people in India to undermine Sino-Indian friendship in the past month, which is regrettable. Prime Minister Nehru should recognize the serious consequences of the anti-China activities of the Indian right-wing parties and be wary of the imperialist conspiracy to sow discord.

Chen Shutong emphasized that our government values maintaining Sino-Indian friendship and has always advocated resolving border issues fairly and reasonably through negotiations. However, maintaining the traditional friendship between China and India is by no means a one-sided matter for us, but requires the joint efforts of China and India.

Hu Yaobang:

We must shout loudly, friends, you are completely wrong, and going on like this will definitely be detrimental to you.

Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, said that the people of our country will never recognize the so-called McMahon Line. He pointed out that Prime Minister Nehru is now personally coming forward to announce to the world that he is insisting that our country accept that line. How can this be regarded as respecting the sovereignty of other countries?

Hu Yaobang said that the extremely unfriendly actions of Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian ruling clique towards our country on the Tibet issue and the Sino-Indian border issue have aroused great interest from the imperialists. He said that our common enemies are so happy, which shows how big a stupid thing Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian ruling clique have done. He said: "We must shout loudly, friends, you are completely wrong, and going on like this will definitely be detrimental to you."

Hu Yaobang said that anyone who is determined to do stupid things can only shoot themselves in the foot. No matter what obstacles there are, the people of China and India will eventually have the strength to break through all this and allow our great friendship that has been established to continue to develop.

Chen Qiyou:

Prime Minister Nehru's slander against China is not based on Sino-Indian friendship at all. Doing so only benefits imperialism.

Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, said that he supports the government's policy of resolving the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultations in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He demanded that the Indian government immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border and restore the long-existing state of the border between the two countries.

Chen Qiyou said that recently a group of Indian thugs demonstrated in front of our embassy and consulates in India, insulting the leaders of our country and government, which cannot but make people feel extremely indignant.

He said that regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on September 8th described it in great detail, and the right and wrong are already very clear. The problem lies in the attitude of Nehru and the Indian government in handling this matter. Chen Qiyou said that recently, the Indian government's series of provocations on the Sino-Indian border and Prime Minister Nehru's slander against China on the Sino-Indian border issue are not based on Sino-Indian friendship at all, but treat friendly neighbors in the way they treat hostile countries. Doing so only benefits imperialism and is detrimental to the people of China and India.

Da Pusheng:

India's attempt to use pressure to force the Chinese people who have stood up to accept illegal and one-sided things is a waste of effort.

Da Pusheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association, said in a written statement: China and India are both countries that have suffered from imperialist aggression for a long time. The Sino-Indian border issue left over from the British rule of India should be resolved rationally through friendly consultations in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Pressure should never be applied to impose India's one-sided claims on China. It is a waste of effort to try to use pressure to force the Chinese people who have stood up to accept illegal and one-sided things.

Da Pusheng said indignantly that we express our firm protest against the anti-China wave and insults against our government leaders launched by Indian officials, right-wing parties, and expansionists. We demand that the Indian government immediately stop this unreasonable provocative behavior, and immediately withdraw the Indian troops and administrative personnel who have crossed the border, restore the peaceful situation on the Sino-Indian border, and resolve the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultations. The Vice Premiums and other members of the State Council, the President of the Supreme People's Court, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Standing Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference attended today's meeting.

The meeting decided to continue tomorrow. (Attached picture)

### 严正谴责印度掀起的反华运动

    全国人民代表大会常委会扩大会议讨论中印边界问题
    严正谴责印度掀起的反华运动
    周恩来总理阐明了我国政府对中印边界问题所采取的立场、态度和方针
    委员们一致指出政府的立场表达了全国人民保卫祖国神圣疆土的坚强意志和维护中印友谊的真诚愿望
    新华社11日讯　第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天下午举行扩大的第六次会议，讨论中印边界问题。会议由朱德委员长主持。
    周恩来总理在会上作了关于中印边界问题的报告。他在报告中除了谈到中印边界问题的历史背景和当前的实际情况以外，着重阐明中国政府在中印边界问题上所采取的立场、态度和方针，提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议。
    周总理说，最近中印边界问题之所以紧张，完全是由于印度的某些别有用心的人士故意制造的，他们利用边境的一些纠纷，掀起了一个新的反华运动，对中国进行恶毒的攻击，污蔑中国“侵略”印度。令人遗憾的是印度政府也毫无根据地指责中国，在军事、外交和舆论方面对中国施加压力，企图把印度关于边界问题的片面主张强加于中国。几个月来，中国方面为了中印友谊，一直保持最大的克制和忍耐，但是，这并没有引起印度官方人士应有的反应。因此，我们不能不把中印边界问题提到庄严的全国人民代表大会常务委员会，对印度方面不友好的攻击作出公开的回答。
    周总理在报告中重申了9月8日给尼赫鲁的信中关于中国政府处理中印边界问题的立场、态度和方针。他说：中国政府一贯主张，中印双方应该考虑历史的背景和当前的实际情况，根据五项原则，有准备有步骤地通过友好协商，全面解决两国边界问题。在此以前，作为临时性的措施，双方应该维持边界久已存在的状况，而不以片面行动、更不应该使用武力改变这种状况；对于一部分争执，还可以通过谈判达成局部性和临时性的协议，以保证边界的安宁，维护两国的友谊。周总理说，我相信全国人民代表大会常务委员会一定会支持政府对于中印边界问题的这种立场和方针。
    周恩来总理详细地谈到中印边界问题的历史背景和当前的实际情况。他指出，中印边界问题是历史遗留下来的复杂问题，两国间大约两千公里的边界线从来没有正式划定，也没有为全面解决边界问题而进行过谈判和勘察，因此没有任何理由要求中国政府接受印度政府关于中印边界的片面主张。至于所谓麦克马洪线，那是英帝国主义侵略西藏的产物，从来没有被中国的任何中央政府承认过，因此肯定是非法的。
    周总理接着指出，即使中印边界全部没有划定，但是，只要双方维持边界久已存在的现状，中印两国还是可以很好地和平共处。过去十年来的情况证明了这一点。在这个期间，在中印边界的西段，的确发生过印度军队和行政人员侵入或者侵占中国领土的事件。但是，由于中国政府始终采取友好态度加以处理，这些事件并没有引起中印两国关系的紧张。而最近，在中印边界的东段，虽然完全是由于印度军队越境侵占了中国的领土，并且是越过了所谓麦克马洪线以北而引起了边境事件，但是，印度方面却大肆喧嚷，造成中印关系的紧张。这是什么缘故呢？显然，印度国内有一部分人故意要在西藏叛乱事件之后再一次在中印两国之间制造紧张局势，破坏中印友谊，而印度政府也企图借此机会对中国政府施加压力，迫使中国接受印度在两国边界问题上的片面主张，并且按照印度的意志修改地图。周总理着重指出，这种强加于人的企图是永远不能实现的。中国政府从不强加于人，而且为了维护中印友谊和五项原则，坚决反对这样做。
    周总理最后说，中国和印度是总共有着十亿以上人口的两个亚洲大国，我们在维护世界和平特别是亚洲和平方面，有着共同的利益和责任。我们两国有着历史悠久的传统的友好关系，而且又是和平共处五项原则的倡导者，两国之间关于边界问题的分歧，即使是一部分争执，都应该通过友好谈判，求得公平合理的解决，而不应该采取可能导致冲突的办法。
    周恩来总理报告以后，会议进行了讨论。
    新华社11日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会第六次会议扩大会议在周恩来总理报告中印边界问题后，开始进行讨论。委员们在发言中完全同意周恩来总理的报告，完全拥护我国政府对中印边界问题和边境局势所持的严正立场和一贯采取的方针。他们指出：这个立场和方针表达了全国人民对保卫祖国神圣疆土的坚强意志和维护中印友谊的真诚愿望。委员们在发言中对印度某些别有用心的人所掀起的反华运动和印度政府官员对中国的无理指责，一致表示愤慨。
    李济深：
    我们绝不承认所谓麦克马洪线，中印边境的紧张局势完全是印度一手造成的。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在发言时，表示坚决拥护我国政府对中印边界问题和边境局势所采取的正确立场。李济深说：“我们绝不承认所谓麦克马洪线”。他指出：“边境的紧张局势完全是印度一手造成的。”
    李济深说，尼赫鲁总理先生作的有些过分了。印度政府一口咬定的麦克马洪线，是英国对我国西藏地方执行侵略政策的产物。这条界线，当时曾经引起了中国人民的无比愤慨，也从未被中国任何中央政府所承认，因此肯定是不合法的。现在印度政府竟要求中国政府正式承认英国对中国西藏地方进行侵略所造成的局面，这是完全没有道理的。
    李济深说，自从中国西藏地方发生叛乱以来，中印边界的紧张局势，完全是由印度一手造成的。他对印度总理尼赫鲁最近对于中国的指责感到遗憾。他说，尼赫鲁的这些言论和作法只能使关心中印友好关系的朋友们感到痛心，使挑拨中印友谊、制造紧张局势的反动派拍手称快。
    李济深说，我国政府向来以中印友谊为重，以和平事业为重，对中印边境问题，一直采取异常克制的态度。他劝告印度政府应立即悬崖勒马。他说，我国政府从来不侵犯别人，也从来不会容忍别人的侵犯。他希望印度政府不要上了帝国主义者的当，要采取明智的态度，在五项原则的基础上，通过和平谈判来解决中印边界纠纷。这符合于中印两国人民的利益，也是全世界爱好和平人民的希望。
    沈钧儒：
    警告印度政府当局：中印边境的紧张局势如果继续发展下去，如果帝国主义者及其在印度的代理人的阴谋得逞，首先就对印度不利。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒严正地警告印度政府当局：中印两国边境的紧张局势如果继续发展下去，如果帝国主义者及其在印度的代理人的阴谋得逞，首先就对印度不利。
    沈钧儒说，中印两国人民自古以来友好相处，但近来印度官方人士、议员、右翼政党和他们所掌握的报刊竟在西藏叛乱事件后又就中印边界问题大肆叫嚣，对中国极尽造谣诽谤之能事，这是中国人民所不能容忍的。
    他说，和平共处五项原则创始人之一的尼赫鲁先生，对于印军侵入我国边境，不反躬自省，反而诬蔑我国进行“侵略”，这不是颠倒是非吗？
    沈钧儒指出，印度有一批人始终在制造分裂阴谋，破坏中印两国的友好关系，想把印度拉进军事集团的泥坑里去。他们的目的就是在亚洲继续制造紧张局势，使印度变成帝国主义的军事基地。沈钧儒问道：“倡导不结盟政策的尼赫鲁先生难道可以毫无警惕，容许这种阴谋活动继续进行吗？”
    沈钧儒说，新中国建国十年以来，在国际事务中始终坚持和平政策。但是假如有人把我国的和平外交政策认为是软弱可欺，那就大错特错了。
    黄炎培：
    把我国的领土说成是印度的领土，把印度军队越境挑衅说成是我国对印度的“侵略”，这种颠倒黑白，不是违反五项原则吗？
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培说，他对印度总理尼赫鲁最近在印度议会中肯定麦克马洪线是中印两国的边界线一点感到非常惊讶。他说，把我国的领土说成是印度的领土，把印度军队越境挑衅说成是我国对印度的“侵略”，这种颠倒黑白，不是违反五项原则吗？
    黄炎培说，在1913年到1914年时，正是我国辛亥革命以后不久，当时我正参加政治活动，我就知道，那时的中国政府就根本没有承认过什么“麦克马洪线”，不仅我国从没有承认，就连二十年前做过印度东北部阿萨姆邦长官的英国人亨利·特怀南也说：“所谓中印边境的麦克马洪线从来就没有得到承认。”而印度政府竟要中国接受这条非法界线，这完全是继承英国历来对中国西藏地方进行侵略的政策，决不是曾经长期遭受帝国主义侵略的一个国家所应该有的作法。
    黄炎培接着斥责印度反动派恶毒攻击我国侵犯别国领土的谰言。他指出，尼泊尔、不丹、锡金政府负责人辟谣的谈话彻底戳破了这些谎言。他说，这些造谣污蔑的行为是可鄙的。
    黄炎培说，我国尊重友好国家的领土主权，但是也要求对方同样尊重我国的领土主权。因此，我们坚决要求印度政府立即撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况，来缓和目前的紧张局势，不要上帝国主义挑拨中印关系的当。
    郭沫若：
    尼赫鲁总理竟替英帝国主义辩护，诬蔑我们是“中国帝国主义”，这是非常出人意外的。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若在发言中指出，周恩来总理在9月8日写给印度政府尼赫鲁总理的信和今天的报告，理直气壮、光明磊落。可是尼赫鲁总理却给予了完全相反的答复，他竟替英帝国主义辩护，诬蔑我们是“中国帝国主义”，这是非常出人意外的。
    郭沫若说，英帝国主义乃至其它帝国主义近百年来侵略中国的史实，是我们这一辈人从小孩子的时候就深刻体验到的。他质问道，尼赫鲁先生究竟为什么替英帝国主义辩护呢？
    郭沫若说，印度人民对中国人民是真正友好的，他们衷心在高呼“印度中国是兄弟”，并不如一般反华分子所叫嚣的“印度中国再见”。
    他强调说，印度方面少数猖狂反华的先生们应该清醒一下了，迷途未远，回头是岸。我们的政府和人民是永远坚持和平共处五项原则的。我们衷心希望印度人民坚决地反对挑拨中印关系的帝国主义及其代理人的阴谋，督促印度政府为维护中印友谊与和平事业而共同努力。
    刘宁一：
    严正警告印度的扩张主义者，强大的中国人民坚决不侵犯别人，也决不允许别人对我国的侵犯。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一表示坚决支持我国政府在中印边界问题上所持的严正立场，并对印度侵犯中国领土的行为表示极大的愤慨。
    刘宁一说，印度的一些人最近制造中印边境事件，掀起新的反华浪潮，尤其多次在中国驻印度的大使馆和领事馆门前示威，对我们的国家和我国领导人横加诬蔑，对于如此狂妄的寻衅，我国广大职工不能不表示严正的抗议！
    刘宁一说，当我们中国过去被人欺凌的时代，都不曾承认过所谓“麦克马洪线”，难道在今天当中国人民已经站起来的时候，我国政府就会承认这个非法界线吗？显然，这种可耻的企图，永远是徒劳的。
    刘宁一严正警告印度扩张主义者说，中国人民受欺负的时代一去不复返了，站立起来的强大的中国人民，坚决不侵犯别人，但也决不允许别人对我国侵犯。我们希望印度政府采取明智的态度，回到五项原则立场上来，立即采取措施撤回越境印军和行政人员，恢复两国边界久已存在的状况，使中印边境的紧张局势缓和下来。任何根据片面主张、强加于人的做法，不但不能实现，而且只能损伤两国的友谊，使仇快亲离，遭到中国人民和印度人民的反对，也遭到全世界爱好和平的人民的反对。
    陈叔通：
    我国政府以保持中印友好为重，但要保持中印的传统友谊，决不是我们单方面的事情。
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通说：这次中印边境事件，是印度方面对我国的一种挑衅行为，我们全国人民一致感到非常愤慨。他说，印度在没有独立以前，也是受到英帝国主义的侵略的，尼赫鲁总理和印度政府现在偏偏把当时英帝国主义的侵略阴谋说成是一个既成事实，这种态度难道同尼赫鲁总理所一向倡导的五项原则相符吗？尼赫鲁总理是五项原则的创始人之一，但他竟对最近一个月来印度某些人士破坏中印友谊的行动采取纵容的态度，这是令人遗憾的。尼赫鲁总理应该认识到印度右翼政党反华活动的严重后果，警惕帝国主义挑拨离间的阴谋。
    陈叔通强调说，我国政府以保持中印友好为重，始终主张用谈判的方式公平合理地解决边界问题。但是，要保持中印的传统友谊，决不是我们单方面的事情，而是要中印两国共同努力。
    胡耀邦：
    我们要大喝一声，朋友，你们完全错了，这样走下去对你们肯定是有损无益的。
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦说，我国人民绝不承认所谓麦克马洪线。他指出，尼赫鲁总理现在亲自出马，向全世界宣布，硬要我国接受那条界线，这怎么能谈得上尊重别国的主权呢？
    胡耀邦说，尼赫鲁总理和印度当权派在西藏问题和中印边界问题上对我国的极不友好的行为，已经引起帝国主义的极大兴趣。他说，我们的共同敌人那么高兴，那就说明尼赫鲁总理和印度当权派作了多么大的蠢事。他说：“我们要大喝一声，朋友，你们完全错了，这样走下去对你们肯定是有损无益的。”
    胡耀邦说，一切决心做蠢事的人，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。不管有甚么障碍，中印两国人民终究会有力量冲破这一切，使我们已经建立起来的伟大友谊，继续向前发展。
    陈其尤：
    尼赫鲁总理对中国的诬蔑，完全不是从中印友好出发，这样做，只有利于帝国主义。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤说，他拥护政府所采取的以和平共处五项原则，通过友好协商来解决中印边界问题的方针。他要求印度政府立即撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，恢复两国边境久已存在的状况。
    陈其尤说，最近印度一批暴徒向我国驻印度大使馆和领事馆示威，辱骂我们国家和政府的领导人，这不能不令人感到万分愤慨。
    他说，关于中印边界问题，周恩来总理在9月8日给尼赫鲁总理的信中，说得十分详细，是非曲直，已经非常清楚。问题在于尼赫鲁和印度政府对于处理这件事的态度。陈其尤说，最近，印度政府在中印边境的一系列的挑衅和尼赫鲁总理在中印边界问题上对中国的诬蔑，完全不是从中印友好出发，而是以对待敌对国家的做法来对待友好的邻邦。这样做，只有利于帝国主义，对于中印两国人民是有损无益的。
    达浦生：
    印度想用施加压力的办法，强迫站起来了的中国人民接受非法的片面的东西，是枉费心机的。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生在书面发言中说：中印两国都是曾经长期遭受帝国主义侵略的国家，对英国统治印度时期所遗留下的中印边界问题，理应通过友好协商的方式按照和平共处五项原则加以合理解决，绝对不应施加压力，把印度的片面主张强加于中国。对站起来了的中国人民，要想用施加压力的办法，强迫接受非法的片面的东西，都是枉费心机的。
    达浦生愤慨地说，我们对于印度官方人士、右翼政党、扩张主义分子所掀起的反华浪潮和侮辱我国政府领导人的行为，表示坚决的抗议。我们要求印度政府立即制止这种无理挑衅的行为，并立即撤回越境的印度军队和行政人员，恢复中印边境的宁静局势，并且通过友好协商的办法，来解决中印边境问题。国务院的副总理及其他组成人员、最高人民法院院长、最高人民检察院检察长，以及政协全国委员会常务委员列席了今天的会议。
    会议决定明天继续举行。（附图片）
