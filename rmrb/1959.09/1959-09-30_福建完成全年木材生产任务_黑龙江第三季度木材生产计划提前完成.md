Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th: The nearly 300,000 forestry workers fighting in the Fujian forest area, one of China's major timber supply bases, have overfulfilled the annual timber production task by 2.6% three months and eight days ahead of schedule. By September 22, the province's forestry workers had produced a total of 3.07 million cubic meters of timber. This figure is close to the timber production target originally planned to be completed in 1962. Large quantities of timber are being shipped out of Fujian to support industrial and agricultural production and construction in various regions. Superior quality timber shipped to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Wuhan, and the industrial and mining enterprises under the central authorities reached 1,382,200 cubic meters, exceeding the amount transported in the same period last year by 15%.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of forestry production, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China established a timber production headquarters. Party committees at all levels in the forest areas have also formed timber production leading bodies. Local party organizations and people's communes have increased manpower and materials for timber production in many ways. The manpower invested in timber production has rapidly increased from about 100,000 to nearly 300,000 people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: The 300,000 forestry workers in Heilongjiang Province have overfulfilled the third quarter timber production plan fourteen days ahead of schedule. The workers are determined to comprehensively over fulfill this year's annual timber production plan fifty days ahead of schedule.

    This year, the province's completed forest renewal and afforestation area has also exceeded more than five times that of the same period last year; chemical production of forest products has exceeded nearly doubled that of the same period last year.

    据新华社福州27日电　奋战在我国南方主要木材供应基地之一的福建林区里的近三十万林业大军，已经提前三个月又八天超额2.6％完成了全年的木材生产任务。到9月22日，这个省的林业工人共生产了三百零七万立方米木材。这个数字接近原计划在1962年完成的木材生产指标，大批木材正由福建源源外运，支援各地工农业生产建设。仅是运往上海、江苏、安徽、河北、山西、山东、武汉和中央各单位的工矿企业部门的优等木材即达一百三十八万二千二百立方米，超过去年同期外运量的15％。
    为了加强林业生产的领导，中共福建省委专门成立了木材生产指挥部，林区各级党委也都组成了木材生产领导机构。各地党组织和人民公社，多方面增加木材生产的人力、物力，投入木材生产的人力迅速由十万人左右增到近三十万人。
    据新华社哈尔滨28日电　黑龙江省三十万林业职工已经提前十四天超额完成了第三季度木材生产计划。职工们决心提前五十天全面超额完成今年全年的木材生产计划。
