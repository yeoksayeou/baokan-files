Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch:

    Just opinions in various countries point out that the so-called "Chinese aggression against India" is pure fabrication.
    Western provocation of Sino-Indian relations aims to intensify the Cold War.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 10th - The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial on September 3rd, emphasizing that the so-called "Chinese aggression against India" is clearly a complete fabrication.
    The newspaper said: "Let us get used to not believing the propaganda of the imperialist newspapers. Let us get used to thinking correctly and completely."
    The Australian "Tribune" published a commentary last week stating that the news about China's "aggression" against India was fabricated. The newspaper pointed out that the imperialists spread this news in order to maintain the scale of the Cold War and to divert people's attention from their own aggression and war preparations in Laos and elsewhere.
    The newspaper also said that there has never been a clear boundary line in the Sino-Indian border area.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 9th - The "People's Solidarity" published a commentary on Sino-Indian relations on the 6th, refuting the fabricated news reported by some local newspapers about China's aggression against India.
    The commentary emphasized that "Socialist People's China pursues a policy of peaceful coexistence in international relations, taking Lenin's principle that peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is possible as a guide. It demonstrates the true nature of Chinese society: it will never allow aggression or invasion again."
    The commentary said, "However, the imperialist countries and reactionary forces are uneasy about the normal relations established between China and India. If we look at the provocative stance of the Indian reactionaries, we will find that they are largely the position of the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party demands that India bomb the roads leading from China to the Indian border, using the excuse of stopping the so-called Chinese troop build-up."
    The commentary pointed out that Nehru himself admitted that he had received formal memorandums from the People's China, which denied any aggression or any build-up of Chinese troops. The commentary said, "All peace-loving people around the world hope that Sino-Indian relations will remain a good example of relations between countries with different social systems."
    The commentary pointed out that the interests of the people of all countries are the same, and that is peace. "The will for peace will triumph. This can be clearly seen in the policies of People's China and other socialist countries. What makes all peace-loving people in the world happy always makes the warmongers and their lackeys sad."
    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, September 10th - The Lebanese "Call of the Voice" published an editorial on the 4th, refuting the sensational news fabricated by Western news agencies about the Sino-Indian border incident. The editorial said that all the news reported by the imperialist news agencies about the actions of Chinese troops along the Indian border and their "violation" of Indian territory was fabricated in accordance with the interests of the imperialist countries that these news agencies represent.
    The newspaper said: "The imperialist groups in Washington and London have never stopped plotting against People's China. Before the United Nations General Assembly (which will discuss the issue of restoring the seat of People's China) convenes, it is natural for these two imperialist countries, which are using every means to create unrest in Asia, to intensify their provocations against China."
    Xinhua News Agency, September 10th - Jerusalem Israeli District News, the Israeli "People's Call" published an article on the 3rd stating that India's big bourgeoisie is increasingly uneasy about the socialist achievements of the People's Republic of China; out of their class interests, they are now trying everything possible to worsen the friendly relations between India and China. These forces are concentrated in the right wing of the Congress Party.
    The article said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru has the potential to become a leader respected by people of all strata in India. Therefore, the masses in his country will never turn a blind eye to his recent policies' serious departure from the Panchsheel principles. The article said that Nehru announced that he was ready to protect Sikkim and Bhutan, as if these two countries were already threatened by the People's Republic of China.
    The article pointed out that the increasingly bad relations between China and India are the result of the Indian government's support for the Tibetan rebellion and the provocative activities of Indian expansionists.

### 各国公正舆论指出所谓“中国侵略印度”纯属捏造  西方挑拨中印关系旨在加剧冷战

    各国公正舆论指出所谓“中国侵略印度”纯属捏造
    西方挑拨中印关系旨在加剧冷战
    新华社10日讯　印度尼西亚“人民日报”在9月3日发表社论强调指出，所谓“中国侵略印度”的消息显然是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    这家报纸说：“让我们习惯于不相信帝国主义报纸的宣传吧。让我们习惯于进行正确和完善的思考吧。”
    澳大利亚“论坛报”在上星期发表评论说，关于中国“侵略”印度的消息是捏造的。这家报纸指出，帝国主义者散播这些消息是为了保持冷战的规模和转移人们对他们自己在老挝等地进行侵略和备战活动的注意。
    这家报纸还说，中印边境地区从来没有明确的疆界线。
    据新华社巴格达9日电　“人民团结报”6日就中印关系发表评论，驳斥某些当地报纸报道的所谓中国侵略印度的捏造消息。
    评论强调说，“社会主义的人民中国在国际关系中奉行着和平共处的政策，把列宁关于不同社会制度的国家之间有可能和平共处的原则作为指南，它表明了中国社会真实的性质：它再也不会允许进攻或侵略。”
    评论说，“可是帝国主义国家和反动力量对中印之间建立的正常关系感到不安。如果我们看一看印度反动派挑衅的立场的话，那么我们会发现它们在很大程度上是社会党的立场。社会党要求印度轰炸中国通往印度边境的道路，借口是制止所谓中国军队集结。”
    评论指出，尼赫鲁自己也承认，他从人民中国那里收到正式备忘录，这些备忘录否认进行过任何侵略或中国军队有任何集结现象。评论说，“全世界爱好和平的人士希望中印关系仍然是不同社会制度的国家之间的关系的良好的榜样。”
    评论指出，各国人民的利益是一样的，这就是和平。“和平的意志将取得胜利。这在人民中国和其他各个社会主义国家的政策中可以显而易见地看到。使全世界一切爱好和平的人士感到高兴的事情总是使战争贩子和他们的走狗感到悲哀。”
    新华社贝鲁特10日电　黎巴嫩“呼声报”在4日发表社论驳斥西方通讯社就中印边界事件所捏造的耸人听闻的消息。社论说，帝国主义通讯社所报道的一切有关中国军队在印度边界沿线的行动以及他们“侵犯”印度领土的消息，都是按照这些通讯社所代表讲话的帝国主义国家的利益捏造的。
    这家报纸说：“华盛顿和伦敦的帝国主义集团从来没有停止过策划反对人民中国的阴谋。在联合国大会（它将讨论恢复人民中国的席位问题）开会之前，采用一切办法在亚洲制造不安的这两个帝国主义国家现在正在加紧对中国进行挑衅，这是自然的事情。”
    新华社10日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息，以色列“人民呼声报”在3日刊载的一篇文章说，印度的大资产阶级对中华人民共和国的社会主义成就越来越感到不安；出于他们的阶级利益，他们现在正在想尽办法使印中友好关系恶化。这些势力都集中在国大党的右翼。
    文章说，印度总理尼赫鲁完全有可能成为印度各阶层人民所尊敬的领袖，因此，他的国家的群众对他最近的政策中严重脱离潘查希拉原则的表现决不会不闻不问。文章说，尼赫鲁宣布他准备保护锡金和不丹，好像这两个国家已经受到中华人民共和国的威胁一样。
    文章指出，中国同印度的关系越来越坏是印度政府支持西藏叛乱和印度扩张主义分子的挑衅活动的结果。
