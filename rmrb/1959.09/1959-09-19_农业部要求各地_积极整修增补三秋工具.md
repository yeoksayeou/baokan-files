Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 14th regarding the active repair and supplementation of tools for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing). The notice urges all regions to prepare sufficient tools to victoriously complete this year's autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing tasks.

The notice states that the focus of tools for the "Three Autumns" this year should be on harvesting, threshing, deep plowing, sowing, and transportation tools. The preparation of tools for the "Three Autumns" must proceed from the local production requirements, pay attention to practical results, and adopt a principle of combining repair, increase, modification of old tools, and innovation; emphasize both promotion, use, maintenance, and management; and comprehensively arrange for large, medium, and small-sized tools made of iron, wood, and bamboo, to fully leverage the efficiency of existing agricultural tools and machinery.

To ensure the successful completion of the preparation of tools for the "Three Autumns," the notice requires departments in charge of agricultural tools at all levels to immediately take up this work, unify the organization of various departments' strengths, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, give play to the role of various favorable conditions, and make specific arrangements. First, existing tools must be repaired well to fully utilize the tools already promoted. Deficiencies should be promptly arranged for production to meet needs. Tools that have been finalized should be actively promoted, and those that have not been finalized should be carefully evaluated, improved, and created. Tools that have been promoted in the past but have not been put into use should be specifically analyzed and studied, refitted, and techniques taught so that they can all be used. The notice requires relevant departments for tool reform in all provinces (regions) and cities to seize favorable opportunities according to the central government's instructions, resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative sentiments, continue to exert great effort, and vigorously launch a mass movement for tool reform.
