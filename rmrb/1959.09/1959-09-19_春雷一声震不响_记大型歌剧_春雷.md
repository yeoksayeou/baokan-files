    A Spring Thunder That Doesn't Resonate
    ——A Record of the Grand Opera "Spring Thunder"
    By Our Reporter Zhu Jigong

    “In August, oh,
    The wooden bucket sounds, oh,
    Sixzi's abacus plus a big dipper, uh,
    The Pan family manor, the landlord's granary is full, the pigsty is
      overflowing,
    The farmers by Lotus Lake, ah,
    Bran skins and sweet potato roots, oh…”

    The rich Hunan melody takes the audience to the banks of Lotus Lake in Xiangjiang. The moonlight is dim, the evening breeze rustles, and a bamboo grove stands before the lake embankment. Farmers gather to pour out their grievances about the greed and crimes of the landlord Pan… Amidst a strong musical melody, thunder rumbles. The overture to the grand opera "Spring Thunder" shows that the peasant movement is like an arrow on a drawn bow, ready to be triggered, and a storm is about to break.

    "Spring Thunder" is the first drama depicting the Hunan peasant movement during the First Revolutionary Civil War in China. Written by Hai Xiao, composed by Chen Zi and Du Yu, and directed and conducted by Lü Peng and Liu Zhu respectively. After watching the invitational performance by the Central Experimental Opera Troupe recently, cultural circles in the capital believe that it has yielded many new gains in expressing new and important themes.

    The playwright uses a straightforward approach, revealing the conflict to the audience at the beginning of the drama. In the spring of 1927, on the banks of Lotus Lake, the quiet village of ChashanZui, unleashed a wave of anger. Pan Yaxiong (played by Hua Songru), a peasant movement worker who had just returned from another village, and the young farmer Ye Xiaorong (played by Liu Wanyu) excitedly told everyone: "A spring thunder sounds, peasant associations are rising on both sides of the Xiangjiang River, the banner of the yellow plow flies in the sky, the suffering farmers raise their heads, the neighboring counties and villages are engaged in a vigorous campaign, the villagers of Lotus Lake gather their fists, let's do it too." At this time, Tang Zhen (played by Wei Bingzhe), the person in charge of the county peasant association representing the correct leadership of the Party, and the right-leaning opportunist Yi Zongxiu (played by Tan Yachou) arrived. The peasants couldn't wait for an order to set up the peasant association. When Tang Zhen and Pan Yaxiong helped everyone happily plan to establish the peasant association, Yi Zongxiu was left alone on the stage, cold and indifferent. He believed that the masses were "joining in the fun" and "going too far." This man, with a worried look, a thin and tall figure, and full of "delicacy," muttered and sang: "...Why raise carrying poles and wave spears, scaring people away, why parade through the villages wearing tall hats, causing social order to be a mess...", amid the laughter of the audience, Yi Zongxiu slipped off the stage in disgrace.

    Several mass scenes in the opera are exciting and show the surging, heroic, and tenacious spirit of the peasants who were organized for the first time. After the peasant movement developed, class contradictions became increasingly acute. The big landlord Pan Rongzhai (played by Wang Jiansheng) wanted to escape to Shanghai, and his son Pan San (played by Wang Jiaxiang) forcibly kidnapped the poor peasant's daughter, Manmeizi (played by Guo Lanying), to his home. When the peasants received this news, they were furious and could no longer tolerate it. At this time, such a scene appeared on the stage: under the leadership of Tang Zhen, the peasants raised their spears and hoes, holding torches, and marched mightily towards the Pan family manor. The night was vast, and the firelight illuminated the sky. Among the crowd, Manmeizi's mother (played by Guan Kunfan) also rushed forward with a kitchen knife in her hand. How could the high walls and gates of the landlord's house withstand the tidal wave of people? Everyone raised a wooden stake, "Boom! Boom! Boom!" Pan Rongzhai's residence—symbolizing the stubborn feudal stronghold of thousands of years—was finally breached. Amidst the cheers of victory, people rescued Manmeizi and caught the tyrant Pan San.

    The scene of the peasants singing and dancing to celebrate the establishment of the peasant association fully demonstrated the ambition of the Chinese people and the spirit to destroy the enemy's arrogance. Flowers bloomed in the fields, and a banner reading "Celebrating the Establishment of the Peasant Association" was hung in front of the Pan family ancestral hall. The sound of voices was noisy, the mood was agitated, the young men with white towels on their heads, the young women dressed in red and green, each energetic, and proud. Several peasants carrying red-tasseled spears escorted Pan San up. Under the power of the masses, Pan San no longer had the domineering aura of the past. He wore a three-foot-high paper hat and hid in a corner of the stage like a mangy dog. Pan Yaxiong led the crowd in shouting "Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry!" "All power to the peasant association!" Pan San was so frightened that his face turned pale and he shivered. The petty tyrant Wang Da and the rich peasant Pan Jiayou were also rebuked by the crowd. The sound shook the sky, the drums and music sounded together, Ye Xiaorong and Manmeizi sang and danced, and then the crowd escorted Pan San to parade along the embankment to show the public.

    "Spring Thunder's" playwrights, directors, and actors have created positive characters such as Tang Zhen and Pan Yaxiong, who are loyal and wholeheartedly wage unyielding struggles against the enemy, which further sets off the ugliness and shamefulness of the right-leaning opportunist Yi Zongxiu.

    The young actor Wei Bingzhe portrayed on the stage the image of Tang Zhen, a peasant association leader from a mining background who was cultivated by the Party. He is cheerful in character and decisive in his actions. When the peasant militia was undergoing training in the county, the Kuomintang right-wing officer Li Guoliang came to conspire to reorganize the militia under the pretext of "replenishing reserves." He came aggressively, drawing out his pistol and aiming it at Tang Zhen's chest. At this time, Wei Bingzhe remained motionless, with a righteous and awe-inspiring demeanor, performing Tang Zhen's spirit of not being afraid of danger and being firm. Later, when the peasant militia was gearing up to attack Changsha, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and capture Xu Kexiang alive, Yi Zongxiu happily relied on Chen Duxiu's order to force Tang Zhen to let everyone put down their guns. Tang Zhen resolutely swore to everyone: "We cannot disperse, we cannot leave, the (May 21st Incident) must be avenged, and the blood of our comrades cannot be shed in vain." He firmly opposed Yi Zongxiu's proposal to negotiate with the big landlord Pan Rongzhai, and he led the team to break through. Yi Zongxiu completely embarked on the counter-revolutionary path of compromising and surrendering to the enemy.

    Pan Yaxiong, played by the young actress Hua Songru, also left a deep impression on people. She has short black hair, bright apricot eyes, wearing a round-collared short jacket and a black skirt, active among the peasant masses, sometimes introducing to everyone the good news of neighboring counties establishing peasant associations, sometimes like a kind older sister organizing young women such as Manmeizi. Since the fruits of the revolution were usurped by the bourgeoisie, the Pan family ancestral hall became a place where the big landlords cruelly murdered revolutionary martyrs. Yaxiong, Manmeizi, Granny Liu, and several peasants were tied up by the militia and imprisoned in front of the ancestral hall. Pan Yaxiong, who had betrayed the landlord family, advised Granny Liu not to sigh, she told Manmeizi not to shed tears, she said to everyone: "There will always be stumbles when climbing mountains and crossing ridges, and it is inevitable to encounter headwinds when sailing, if we endure some hardship, the revolution will surely succeed, the reactionaries are like grass-head dew, they cannot see the red sun in the East, the red flag will rise and never fall, fluttering in the sky for thousands of years..." Her tenacious revolutionary will even frightened the enemy. The old landlord Pan Rongzhai, who had returned to his hometown, finally wanted to use his relationship as a paternal uncle to lure Yaxiong into betraying the revolution. He personally untied Yaxiong, "Slap! Slap!" Two sounds, the old ghost unexpectedly received a slap, Yaxiong stood tall and sang: "You can kill or chop as you please, but it is difficult to take away my integrity," the heroes fell, but their heroism will always remain in the hearts of the people.

    The "epilogue" of "Spring Thunder" is a starry night. Manmeizi escaped from danger, and Tang Zhen returned to ChashanZui. He told the masses that there was a people's own team in the mountains to the east, and Chairman Mao (Zedong) had come to Hunan. The music soared, and the thunder shook the earth. The masses realized that although the revolution had suffered a temporary setback, the dawn was ahead, the people had their own leader, a round red sun was about to rise, and new victories were waiting for them.

    Last year, Hai Xiao, the playwright of "Spring Thunder," and the actors of the Central Experimental Opera Troupe went to Changsha and other places to visit former militia members, veteran Party members, and families of martyrs. During the creation and rehearsal of "Spring Thunder," the playwrights, directors, and actors together seriously studied the history of the Chinese revolution and revolutionary documents such as Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." This opera absorbed a lot of Hunan folk songs and opera music, making the whole play rich in a strong folk art style. During the rehearsal process, the Cultural Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China gave a lot of instructions and assistance to improve the ideological and artistic quality of this play.

    春雷一声震不响
    ——记大型歌剧“春雷”
    本报记者　朱继功
    “八月里来喂，
    木桶响罗喂，
    六子算盘加大斗呃，
    潘家大屋财东家谷满仓，猪满
      楼，
    莲子湖畔种田人哪，
    糠皮红薯根罗喂……”
    浓厚的湖南曲调，把观众带到了湘江的莲子湖畔。月色昏黄，晚风飒飒，湖滨大堤前一片修竹，农民们聚在一块，倾诉大地主潘家的贪婪与罪恶……在强烈的音乐旋律中，雷声隆隆。大型歌剧“春雷”的序曲，显示出农民运动好比强弩之矢，一触即发，暴风骤雨即将来临了。
    “春雷”是第一部描写我国第一次国内战争时期湖南农民运动的戏剧。由海啸编剧，陈紫、杜宇作曲，侣朋、刘洙分任导演和指挥。首都文艺界最近看了中央实验歌剧院的招待演出以后，认为它在表现新的重大的主题方面，有不少新的收获。
    剧作家用开门见山的手法，在戏剧的一开始就向观众揭示了矛盾。1927年春天，莲子湖边，宁静的茶山咀村，掀起了怒风险浪。刚从外乡回来的农运工作人员潘亚雄（华松如饰）和青年农民叶小荣（柳万雨饰）兴冲冲地告诉大伙：“春天一声雷，湘江两岸兴农会，黄犁头旗子天空飘，种田受苦的把头抬，邻县邻乡轰轰烈烈都搞开，莲子湖畔众乡亲聚拢拳头，咱们也干起来。”这时，代表党的正确领导的县农会的负责人唐震（魏秉哲饰）和右倾机会主义分子易宗秀（谭亚俦饰）到了，农民巴不得一声令下，就把农会办起来。当唐震、潘亚雄帮着大伙兴高采烈地筹划成立农会的时候，舞台上剩下易宗秀冷冷清清一个人，他认为群众是“赶热闹”、“太过火了”。这个愁云满面，清瘦颀长，“秀”气十足的人呐呐地唱道：“……何必举扁担晃梭标，吓得人们走的走逃的逃，何必去游乡戴高帽，闹得社会秩序乱糟糟……”，在观众的哄笑声中，易宗秀灰溜溜地退出了舞台。
    歌剧中几个群众场面扣人心弦，显示了第一次组织起来的农民汹涌澎湃，英勇顽强的气概。农民运动开展后，阶级矛盾越来越尖锐了。大地主潘容斋（王健生饰）要逃往上海，他的儿子潘三（王嘉祥饰）强把贫农的女儿满妹子（郭兰英饰）绑架到家里，农民获得这个消息，怒气冲天，忍无可忍。这时舞台上出现了这样的场面，农民们在唐震的领导下，纷纷扛起梭标，举起锄头、火把，浩浩荡荡直奔潘家大屋。夜色苍茫，火光映天。人群中，满妹子的老娘（关坤凡饰）也手提菜刀，奋身抢前。地主家的高墙大门，怎抵得住浪潮般的人流，大伙抬起一根木桩，“轰！轰！轰！”潘容斋的住宅——象征着几千年来的顽固的封建堡垒，终于被攻破了。在胜利的欢呼声中，人们救出了满妹子，逮住了恶霸潘三。
    农民们欢腾歌舞庆祝农会成立的一场戏，充分显现了长人民的志气，灭敌人的威风的气魄。田陌上鲜花盛开，潘家祠堂前挂起了“庆祝农会成立”的标语。人声嘈杂，群情激昂，头扎白毛巾的小伙子，穿红着绿的青年妇女，个个精神抖擞，扬眉吐气。几个扛着红缨枪的农民押着潘三走上来，在群众的威力下，潘三平日那副横行霸道的气势已一丝没有了，他头上戴着三尺来高的纸帽子，像一条癞狗似地躲在舞台的一角。潘亚雄领众高呼“打倒土豪劣绅！。”“一切权力归农会！”吓得潘三面如土色，直打哆嗦。小劣绅王大和富农潘家有也分别被众人训斥一顿。统声震天，鼓乐齐鸣，叶小荣和满妹子载歌载舞，接着群众押着潘三游堤示众去了。
    “春雷”的编剧、导演和演员塑造了唐震、潘亚雄等赤胆忠心，同敌人进行顽强不息斗争的正面人物，这更加陪衬出右倾机会主义者易宗秀的丑恶和可耻。
    青年演员魏秉哲在舞台上塑造了唐震这个党一手培养起来的矿工出身的农会负责人的形象，他性格爽朗，作事果断。农民纠察队在县里集训时，国民党右翼军官李国梁借“补充后备”为名，前来阴谋收编纠察队。他来势汹汹，拔出盒子炮瞄准唐震的胸膛，这时魏秉哲纹丝不动，正义凛然，把唐震临危不惧，坚定不移的气质表演得很好。以后，当农民纠察队正磨拳擦掌，要去攻打长沙，打倒蒋介石，活捉许克祥的时候，易宗秀兴高彩烈地凭借陈独秀的命令，硬逼唐震让大伙放下枪杆子，唐震同大伙断然宣誓：“我们不能散，我们不能走，（马日事变）仇要报，不能让同志血白流。”他坚决反对了易宗秀同大地主潘容斋谈判的主张，他带着队伍突围了。易宗秀就彻底走上了同敌人妥协、投降的反革命道路。
    潘亚雄是由青年演员华松如扮演的，也给人们留下了深刻的印象。她乌黑的短发，闪闪发亮的杏眼，穿着圆角的短袄和黑裙子，活跃在农民群众中，一会儿给大伙介绍邻县创办农会的好消息，一会儿像亲姐姐似的把满妹子等年轻妇女组织起来。自从革命的成果被资产阶级篡夺以后，潘家祠堂变成了大地主惨杀革命志士的刑场。亚雄、满妹子、柳老娘和几个农民被团丁用五花大绑囚禁在祠堂前。背叛了地主家庭的潘亚雄，她劝柳老娘别叹息，她叫满妹子泪莫涌，她对大伙说：“登山越岭总会有跌闪，行船难免遇着顶头风，经些难受些苦革命一定能成功，反动派好比草头露，见不得东方太阳红，红旗升起永不落，千年万年飘长空……”顽强的革命意志竟叫敌人也吓疯了。重新回到乡里的老地主潘容斋最后还想利用亲伯父的关系，诱骗亚雄背叛革命，他亲手给亚雄松绑，“劈拍！”两响，老鬼出其不意地挨了耳光，亚雄挺胸高唱：“要杀要砍听你们便，想夺我气节难上难”，英雄倒下了，但他们的豪情永远留在人民的心坎里。
    “春雷”的“尾声”是一个月明星稀的夜晚。满妹子虎口逃生，唐震回到了茶山咀，他告诉群众东面山上有人民自己的队伍，毛（泽东）委员到湖南来了。乐声跃起，雷声震撼天地。群众领悟到，革命虽然遭到了暂时的挫折，但曙光在前，人民有了自己的领袖，一轮红日即将升起，新的胜利正在等待着他们。
    去年，“春雷”的编剧海啸和中央实验歌剧院的演员们到长沙一带，访问了当年的纠察队队员、老党员、烈士家属等。“春雷”创作和排演过程中，编剧、导演和演员们一起认真地学习了中国革命史和毛主席写的“湖南农民运动考察报告”等革命文献资料。这个歌剧吸取了很多湖南的民歌和戏曲音乐。使全剧富有浓厚的民间艺术风格。在排演过程中，中共北京市委文化部为提高这个剧的思想性和艺术性，给予很多的指示和帮助。（附图片）
