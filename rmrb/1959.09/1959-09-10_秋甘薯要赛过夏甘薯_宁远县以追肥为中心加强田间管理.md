Xinhua News Agency report: In Ningyuan County, Hunan Province, a mass campaign for surpassing summer sweet potato yields with autumn sweet potato yields is underway among the broad masses of commune members. Currently, over 70,000 people across the county are engaged in nurturing and management work, with topdressing as the central task. Over 145,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes throughout the county have generally received two applications of concentrated fertilizer. An average of over 30 dan per mu has been applied, along with two rounds of hoeing, weeding, and pest control. The autumn sweet potatoes are currently growing exceptionally well. Vines are five chi long, and over 100,000 mu have vines covering the ridges. Test digs have revealed that the average sweet potato per plant weighs between ten liang and one jin, with even the poorest weighing four liang to half a jin.

Ningyuan County, a mountainous region, has a long-standing tradition of planting autumn sweet potatoes. This year, to increase total grain production, the Ningyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the people of the entire county to expand the planting area of autumn sweet potatoes, particularly striving to surpass the unit area yield of summer sweet potatoes. This call received the active support of the broad masses of commune members. Communes uniformly arranged labor and planned land use, planting 145,700 mu of autumn sweet potatoes three days before the Start of Autumn, exceeding last year's planting area by 55,000 mu. The quality of planting was also very good, with all sweet potato fields being deeply plowed and 40 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu.

While rushing to plant autumn sweet potatoes, all fifteen communes in the county also transferred more than 20,000 laborers, adopting methods such as digging grass turf on mountains to burn soil ash, cutting green grass and collecting tree leaves to compost green manure, and preparing a large amount of fertilizer for autumn sweet potatoes. Not long ago, all communes in the county arranged for more than 70,000 laborers, organizing 7,000 to 8,000 professional teams to cultivate and manage autumn sweet potatoes, focusing on applying topdressing and carrying out other field management work. In this work, each commune, brigade, work team, and individual commune member selected targets with roughly similar conditions to themselves, enthusiastically launching a red flag competition.

    秋甘薯要赛过夏甘薯
    宁远县以追肥为中心加强田间管理
    据新华社讯  湖南宁远县广大社员掀起了秋红薯赛夏红薯的超额增产运动。目前，全县有七万多人正在进行以追肥为中心的培育管理工作。全县十四万五千多亩秋红薯，现在普遍追施精肥两次以上。平均每亩施三十多担，并且进行了两次中耕除草和杀虫。现在秋红薯长得特别好。蔓长五尺，藤蔓满垅的有十余万亩，试挖结果，一般的每兜红薯已有十两到一斤重，最差的也有四两到半斤。
    多山的宁远县，群众一向有种植秋红薯的习惯。今年，为了增加粮食总产量，中共宁远县委号召全县人民扩大秋薯种植面积，特别是力争单位面积产量赛过夏红薯。这个号召得到广大社员的积极拥护。各公社统一安排劳力、规划土地，在立秋前三天就种了十四万五千七百亩秋红薯，超过去年种植面积五万五千亩。栽种的质量也很好，所有红薯田都普遍深耕，每亩还施了四十担底肥。
    全县十五个公社在抢种秋薯的同时，还抽调了两万多个劳力，采取上山刨草皮烧火土灰和刈青草采树叶沤绿肥等方法，为秋红薯准备了大量的肥料。过去不久，全县各个公社又安排了七万多个劳力，组织了七、八千个培育管理秋红薯的专业队，着重地给秋红薯增施追肥和进行其他田间管理工作。在这一工作中，各公社、大队、作业组、社员个人都选择了与自己条件大体相同的对象，热烈开展了红旗竞赛。
