    Canteens Skillfully Cook for Thousands of Families
    Wai Gan Village Canteen in Binyang Implements "Self-Provided Rice, Collective Cooking" Method, Members are All Satisfied
    Since the summer harvest and planting season, the Wai Gan Village Canteen of Xinqiao Commune in Binyang County, Guangxi, has implemented the policy of "actively running canteens, voluntary participation," and implemented the "self-provided rice, collective cooking" method, which has satisfied all the members.
    Previously, this canteen used large pots for cooking rice and stir-frying dishes. Because there were many people eating, and the food had to be divided after it was cooked, the food would easily get cold, and members would easily get crowded when picking up their food at the same time. As a result, some members found it inconvenient. After the summer harvest, the policy of distributing grain to households was implemented, so some members went home to cook their own meals.
    However, less than two months after the members cooked for themselves, opinions arose again, saying that decentralized cooking was not as good as collective cooking. Several members of the Sixth Team, such as Lin Shixi and Su Zhubiao, took the initiative to go to the cadres and said: "You should find a way to run the canteen well! Cooking by ourselves means getting up early in the morning, which affects sleep; we don't get to rest when we go home at noon; and when we finish work at night, we have to cook again. We don't even have time to attend a meeting." They requested that the canteen be set up, and that the food and dishes be clean and the procedures be simple.
    The Party branch studied the members' requests and decided to implement the policy of "actively running canteens, voluntary participation." Based on the members' opinions, the branch adopted a method of using several pots on one stove, self-provided rice, self-served meals, and collective cooking. Before steaming the rice, the members put the rice and water in jars themselves, and took the rice jars to the canteen for unified cooking; if the members were not free, they could also ask the cooks to add the water. The water used for washing the rice was taken by the members themselves to feed chickens and pigs. After the members filled the jars, they inserted a number tag. When the members returned from production, they picked up their meals according to the number tag. In this way, the food would not easily get cold, and the softness and hardness could suit their tastes; at the same time, the cooks also reduced the procedure of dividing the food. Now two cooks cook for more than two hundred people, and sometimes they even have time to participate in farm work. Members who previously did not want to participate or had withdrawn from the canteen have joined again. Of the eighty-one households in the village, seventy-five have already joined the canteen. The masses praised from their own experience: "Canteens skillfully cook for thousands of families, the commune warms the hearts of thousands of people."

    食堂巧做千家饭
    宾阳外甘村食堂实行“自放米、集体煮”办法，社员个个满意
    广西宾阳县新桥公社外甘村食堂，自夏收夏种开始贯彻了“积极办好、自愿参加”的办食堂方针，实行了“自放米、集体煮”的办法，社员个个满意。
    以前这个食堂是用大锅作饭、大锅炒菜，由于吃饭人多，做好了又要分饭分菜，饭菜既容易凉，社员在同一个时间领取饭菜也容易发生拥挤现象。这样，有些社员就感到不方便。夏收以后，实行了粮食分配到户的政策，因此有一部分社员便回家自行煮饭。
    社员自己煮饭还不到两个月，意见又来了，都说分散煮不如集体煮好。第六队的社员林世锡、苏竹标等几个社员，主动去找干部说：“你们想办法办好食堂吧！自己煮，早上起早影响睡觉；中午回家也不得休息；天黑收工，又得煮饭，想去参加一个会都不得空。”他们要求把食堂办起来，而且要菜饭清洁，手续简便。
    党支部研究了社员的要求，决定贯彻“积极办好、自愿参加”的方针。支部根据社员的意见，采取一灶数锅、自放米、自取饭、集体煮的办法。蒸饭前，由社员自己把米和水放好，装在罐里，把饭罐拿到食堂统一煮；若是社员没有空，也可交待炊事员放水。洗米水由社员自己拿去喂鸡养猪。社员把罐装好后，插上一个号码签。社员生产回来，按照号码签对号取饭，随来随取。这样，饭既不容易凉，软硬又可适合口味；同时炊事员也减少了分饭的手续。现在两个炊事员煮二百多人的饭，有时还有时间去参加农活。以前不愿参加或已退出食堂的社员，又纷纷加入了。全村八十一户社员，已经有七十五户参加食堂。群众从切身体验中歌颂道：“食堂巧做千家饭，公社温暖万人心。”
