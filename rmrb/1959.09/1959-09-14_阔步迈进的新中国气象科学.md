The ten years since liberation have been ten years of the Chinese people advancing bravely on the road of socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and also ten years of vigorous development of China's meteorological science.

Before liberation, due to the reactionary government's lack of attention to science, meteorological science could not be linked to the production and life of the broad masses of people. Therefore, even if a few scientists advocated it in various ways, it was impossible to achieve any development. Until the eve of liberation, China did not have a decent meteorological station network, nor a complete meteorological service system. The number of people engaged in meteorological research work in the whole country was only a few dozen, and only more than 400 research papers were published in more than 20 years. The content was divorced from production practice, and most of them remained in the stage of empirical description, lacking analysis of the physical processes of weather evolution and climate formation. Most of the meteorological instruments needed to be imported from abroad. As for the set of experimental techniques using modern physical achievements to study meteorological microscopic processes, it was completely blank.

After liberation, with the needs of national defense and economic construction, under the leadership of the Party, China's meteorology began a new stage. First of all, through the Party's education and the self-transformation of intellectuals, the vast majority of meteorological workers supported the policy of "theory linked with practice, science serving production" put forward by the Party. Scientific research institutions, universities and meteorological business departments cooperated closely, laying the foundation, building stations, training cadres, learning from the Soviet Union, and establishing daily business, thereby promoting research work combined with China's actual weather, making the face of China's meteorological cause a new one. By 1955, China's synoptic research had been carried out in a more comprehensive manner, climatology had laid a foundation in terms of statistical collation and regional zoning of basic data, and in terms of agricultural meteorology, it had also begun comprehensive investigation work in conjunction with tropical resource development.

In the first half of 1956, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, China's twelve-year science and technology development plan was formulated. Developing China's meteorological cause is an important scientific and technological task of the state. In order to complete this task, on the basis of summarizing the international advanced level and the domestic status quo, a number of scientific core issues, as well as specific measures, general progress and cadre training programs, were put forward, thus officially incorporating the development of China's meteorological science into the track of serving socialist construction, giving meteorological workers across the country a magnificent and splendid prospect. This is an important key to the development of meteorology in China.

In the spring of 1958, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, a great leap forward unprecedented in the country was set off. Under the situation that the great leap forward in industry and agriculture urgently needed scientific and technological innovation, China's meteorological science embarked on a new stage of leap forward. According to the great situation forecast and regional forecast, combined with local geographical and topographic characteristics, weather and climate laws and mass experience, Zhenxiong and other stations in Yunnan created supplementary forecasting methods and promoted them nationwide, which significantly improved the accuracy of local weather forecasts. This is a pioneering work of meteorology science widely and deeply combined with production. In addition, in order to cooperate with the national great leap forward, meteorology science research institutions also embarked on the road of leap forward. Long-term forecasts of weather charts have been newly developed, climate modification in arid areas of Northwest China, artificial rainfall and other blank science departments, as well as the work of melting ice and snow on the Qilian Mountains to solve the drought in Northwest China, have been put on the agenda, and problems that are of practical significance and highly theoretical have also begun to be studied.

The achievements of China's meteorological science research in the past ten years can be divided into the following aspects:

Synoptic Meteorology

Under the guidance of the policy that "weather analysis must be combined with China's actual weather," China's meteorological workers have developed and created a set of weather analysis methods applicable to the western plateau areas of China, discovered the particularity of frontal and cyclone activities in China, and criticized the method of simply copying the Norwegian school's weather analysis methods. Through a series of research works, we have a relatively systematic understanding of the physical processes and statistical characteristics of major weather systems in East Asia. These research results were obtained under the condition of the rapid development of China's weather forecasting business, and played a great role in improving the accuracy of China's weather forecasts.

In weather forecasting business, the most urgent need to be solved is the forecast of dangerous weather. Among them, cold waves, frosts, typhoons, and rainstorms are the focus of meteorological workers' research. Many studies focus on the changes in large-scale circulation patterns and weather processes, and study the outbreak of cold waves and the precipitation caused by cold air activities through examples and statistical analysis. These studies are of practical significance for forecasting cold waves. Another aspect of research focuses on summer precipitation forecasting. In June and July 1954, the Huaihe River Basin experienced the largest flood in a century, and in the summer of 1956, the flood in the Songhua River Basin caused losses to people's lives and property. In order to assist in flood control and regulate water conservancy project hubs, China's meteorological workers paid attention to the research of precipitation forecasting in the early days of liberation. In these research works, the movement of rain areas, the thunderstorms and cold air activities in North China, the cold fronts, blocking highs and cold vortices, the monsoon, thermal lows, warm fronts and typhoon weather systems, as well as the relationship between large-scale weather in the Pacific and precipitation in China were discussed. Many papers also published the results of the study on the precipitation process, rainstorm nature, and air mass activity of the plum rain that occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in June and July. Through this series of work, China's summer precipitation forecast has been gradually established since 1953, which has played an important role in production practice. Since typhoons invade the southeast coast of China in summer and autumn, often causing great damage, meteorological workers attach special importance to the study of typhoons. In a large number of research works, the relationship between typhoon moving paths and typhoon activities and atmospheric circulation, the process of typhoon formation, statistical laws, and the structure and analysis methods of typhoons are discussed. In addition, a lot of research work has also been carried out on dangerous weather such as frost, strong wind, and hail, creating conditions for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts.

In terms of aviation meteorology, certain experience and data have been accumulated for the prediction of condensation trails, visibility in the air, analysis of jet streams over China, icing conditions, and turbulence in plateau terrain, and some theoretical research has been carried out.

Medium and Long-term Weather Forecast

The rapid improvement of China's short-term weather forecast level has played a great role in ensuring the completion of tasks in various departments of the national economy. However, a one- or two-day forecast cannot meet the needs of enterprise departments in work deployment. Therefore, medium and long-term forecasts have gradually been put on the agenda of meteorological work after liberation. Based on learning from the Soviet Union's medium and long-term forecasting methods, systematic research has been carried out. The results are: determining the existence of the Asian natural weather cycle and pointing out its characteristics of being shorter than the European natural cycle and having more mobile systems; proposing the demonstration of dividing natural weather regions, pointing out that the natural weather region can change the weather process due to different seasons; analyzing the process of cold wave outbreaks and classifying the paths; obtaining the precipitation distribution in the summer natural cycle in China and the forecast law of periodic precipitation. On the basis of these studies, meteorological business departments at all levels have established the business of medium-term weather forecasts.

In terms of long-term forecasts, there have been some research works in the early days of liberation, studying the situation of past years of particularly large floods and droughts from the aspects of atmospheric circulation patterns and sea water temperature distribution. Although these studies are very necessary for long-term forecasts, they are not enough to establish a long-term forecasting business. After that, researchers, based on many years of climate data, proposed a monthly average value forecast scheme that can be made one year in advance from the statistical characteristics of the historical changes of meteorological elements. The accuracy of the forecast is about 75% in terms of trends, which has a certain reference effect on agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments, but the development process of the weather process itself and its causal relationship are not understood. In addition, some scholars, based on the Soviet Multanovsky school, started from the classification of natural weather cycles in East Asia, found out the rhythm of various cycles and the relationship between their front and rear evolution sequences, and proposed a long-term forecast method for the evolution sequence of natural weather cycles within a season. The Central Meteorological Science Research Institute has adopted this method to release the 1959 seasonal forecast, and the effect remains to be tested.

In 1958, on the basis of the great leap forward, meteorological stations and research units across the country carried out a large number of studies on medium and long-term forecasts. Starting from local climate data, or from weather chart data, or from the experience of the working people, a variety of medium and long-term forecasting methods were proposed. They were discussed and observed each other at the Lanzhou meeting convened by the Central Meteorological Bureau in October 1958, laying a good foundation for further improving the effectiveness of medium and long-term forecasts in the future. In addition, some meteorological workers, according to the regularity shown by the various characteristics of the seasonal changes of atmospheric circulation, proposed a long-term precipitation forecast method, and used this method to make forecasts for ten days to half a year in 1959. The effect also remains to be tested, and the method also needs to be revised and supplemented after testing.

Numerical Forecast

Based on mastering the physical processes and regional characteristics of weather evolution, performing mathematical calculations on weather equations is the path that weather forecasting should take to guide it from the empirical and qualitative category to the objective and quantitative stage. After China's meteorological workers established the general weather forecasting business in domestic stations, they timely put some attention on this direction.

Atmospheric Circulation

The evolution of weather systems is the main research object in weather forecasting, and it is also a component of atmospheric circulation. Studying atmospheric circulation is of great significance for weather services and basic theories. After liberation, the accumulation of a large amount of sounding and surface meteorological data has enabled us to use tools such as high-altitude isobaric surfaces and vertical profile maps to clarify the structure of atmospheric circulation in East Asia. There are two jet streams in the winter over East Asia. The sudden appearance and disappearance of the southern jet stream in seasonal changes shows the non-linearity of the dynamic structure of atmospheric circulation. This jumping seasonal transition controls the program of medium and long-term weather process evolution, making it possible for us to apply it to medium and long-term weather forecasts. The Tibetan Plateau is the largest obstacle on the Earth's surface, and it has a profound impact on China's weather and climate and even the atmospheric circulation of the entire Northern Hemisphere. In the past ten years, we have invested a lot of manpower in the research on the plateau and achieved considerable good results. The recently written Meteorology of the Tibetan Plateau is a summary of our research on the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on atmospheric circulation. The research results in this area not only have academic value, but also have practical significance.

Climatology

After liberation, the rapid development of socialist economic construction promoted the research of climatology in China. Climate is one of the natural factors that need to be considered in many construction projects. Therefore, the requirements of various production departments for climate data, atlases, and climatological research are becoming more and more common. In the first few years after the founding of New China, considerable efforts were put into sorting out climate data and compiling climate atlases. At the same time, research on various climatological issues was carried out on the basis of new climate data. China's climatological achievements are in the following aspects: First, there are various new climate atlases. These new atlases provide climate data to production departments on the one hand, and are also indispensable tools in climate research on the other hand; Second, there are studies on the climate characteristics of various regions of China and the climate analysis related to basic construction, as well as the climate characteristics and rainstorm analysis of various river basin plans. There is a lot of work in this area, and there is a lot of work in the central government and various provinces; Third, there is the work of climate zoning, and a relatively detailed two- or three-level climate zoning of China has been made; Fourth, there is the research on the East Asian monsoon problem. There has also been a lot of work in this area after liberation. Part of the work is to clarify the characteristics of the East Asian monsoon, and another part of the work is to study the characteristics of atmospheric circulation in East Asia under the influence of the monsoon and terrain. This work is closely related to atmospheric circulation; Fifth, there is the research on the problem of climate formation. We have done some work on problems such as heat balance and water balance.

Agricultural Meteorology

Multi-faceted research has been conducted on the climatic adaptation problems in the introduction of special economic crops in South China. From the perspective of microclimate control, construction plans for shelterbelts, surveys of climate and terrain conditions in the northward movement, and the selection of afforestation sites have been proposed. A variety of agricultural meteorological instruments have been created, agricultural meteorological observation plans have been preliminarily determined, temperature indicators for the growth and development period of rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, and rapeseed have been identified, and research has been conducted on the forecast of their main development period and harvest period. Through microclimate observations, it has been proved that agricultural technical measures such as flowing freezing water, wind barriers, early spring top-ice plowing, and pressing farmland, which are popular among Chinese farmers, are all measures that can improve favorable meteorological effects. In addition, research has been conducted on methods for preventing and predicting agricultural disaster weather. In terms of agricultural climate, many provinces have initially made provincial agricultural climate zoning.

Atmospheric Physics

During the International Geophysical Year, we started ozone observations and prepared conditions for observing noctilucent clouds. For example, in terms of atmospheric physics near the surface layer, theoretical calculations have been carried out on the distribution characteristics of meteorological elements in the lower atmosphere, and some results have been achieved. It should be pointed out that artificial rainfall and the development of cloud and fog physics work. This work is a concrete achievement of the great leap forward. Under the action of daring to think and daring to do, Jilin started China's first artificial rainmaking experiment and achieved results. Subsequently, Gansu, Hebei, Wuhan, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces also carried out artificial rainfall experiments, and have initially established two high mountain cloud and fog stations, which is a good start for China's artificial rainfall work.

Characteristics of Meteorological Science Research

Looking back at the progress of Chinese meteorological research in the past ten years, we believe that the following points should be particularly emphasized.

First, the greatest characteristic of Chinese meteorological research in the past ten years is its close cooperation with the national economy. Although Chinese meteorological workers pay close attention to the inevitable trend of meteorology around the world, our research object is to solve major meteorological problems in socialist construction. Therefore, our meteorology has grown and prospered on Chinese soil. More precisely, the rapid growth of Chinese meteorology is the result of Chinese meteorological workers resolutely supporting the Party's call for "science combined with production needs and theory linked with practice." In the early days of liberation, we saw that it was necessary to establish New China's meteorological business and drive research through the establishment of business. At that time, the research institutions invested most of their efforts in the joint weather analysis and forecasting center and the joint data room. Most of our problems are raised from the current needs and future development of meteorological business. The solution of these problems not only promoted the development of meteorological business, but also improved the level of meteorological science in China and opened up a position for meteorological research. The development of many meteorological research works in the past ten years marks the characteristics that theory solves practical problems, and the solution of practical problems drives and develops theoretical research. In the future, the development of science may be different with objective conditions, but the principle of linking theory with practice will not change.

Second, the state formulated the twelve-year science development plan in 1956, which incorporated Chinese meteorology into the road of socialist construction. At the same time, through the provisions of the scientific plan, the three aspects of business, teaching, and research are combined into an organic whole, mobilizing all forces that can be mobilized, which is convenient to ensure the completion of the current key tasks of scientific research, and also facilitates the arrangement of long-term development steps of basic theories. All of this is inseparable from the leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Party, it would be impossible to coordinate the development of science with the national economic plan.

Third, the mobilization of the broad masses is a great driving force for promoting Chinese meteorological science. In last year's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the guarantee of meteorological conditions was an important key to high-yield and large-area production. The people need meteorology. Almost every commune has mass-run meteorological stations or meteorological posts; meteorology has indeed solved some problems for the people. This has combined the production activities of millions of working people with meteorological work. Last year, the work of supplementary weather forecasts, agricultural meteorology, and local weather control in various stations was inseparable from the promotion and support of the broad masses. Without the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, the call for the great leap forward, and the guiding ideology of the Party's mass line, it would be impossible to achieve such achievements with such a high speed of development. This fact completely shattered the slander of the right-leaning opportunists against the great leap forward.

Fourth, the development of modern meteorology is inseparable from the use of new achievements in physics, but the set of experimental techniques for using modern new technologies to study meteorological microscopic processes has not been completely established in China in the past ten years. The lack of this set of tools limits our development in the direction of depth in the field of meteorological science. Therefore, we must strive to establish this technical system in the future. Another problem is that we have done a lot of descriptive work on weather systems in the past, which has played a great role in the construction of the national economy. In the future, we still need to further reveal the physical characteristics of weather processes of various scales, so as to master the laws and improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, and be able to make correct long-term forecasts of disastrous weather within a longer period of time. This is our biggest problem at present, and it is also the direction we should strive for. However, the general trend of meteorology is to develop in the direction of using new technologies and strengthening the physical foundation. Therefore, it is an important direction for our meteorological research in the future to further reveal the physical mechanism of weather changes through theoretical research, model experiments, and weather analysis, and to master the laws of natural precipitation on the basis of understanding the microscopic process of cloud and fog physics using modern new technologies.

    阔步迈进的新中国气象科学
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长　赵九章
    解放后的十年，是中国人民在共产党和毛主席英明领导下向着社会主义建设道路英勇迈进的十年，也是我国气象科学蓬勃发展的十年。
    解放以前，由于反动政府不重视科学，气象科学不能与广大人民生产、生活相联系；因此，纵使有少数科学家多方提倡，也不可能得到什么发展。一直到解放前夕，我国没有一个像样的气象台站网，也没有一套完整的气象服务系统。全国从事于气象研究工作的人数还不过几十人，二十多年中发表的研究论著仅仅四百多篇。内容是脱离生产实际的，而且多半停留在经验描述的阶段，缺少天气演变和气候形成的物理过程的分析。大部分的气象仪器需仰给于国外进口。至于利用现代物理新成就来研究气象微观过程的一套实验技术，则完全处于空白状态。
    解放以后，随着国防和经济建设的需要，在党的领导下，我国气象学开始了新的阶段。首先，通过党的教育和知识分子的自我改造，绝大多数的气象工作者，拥护党所提出“理论联系实际，科学为生产服务”的方针，科学研究机构、大学和气象业务部门密切地配合起来，打基础，建台站，培养干部，学习苏联，建立日常业务，从而推动了与我国的实际天气相结合的研究工作，使我国气象事业的面貌焕然一新。到1955年，我国的天气学研究已有了较全面的开展，气候学在基础资料的统计整理和区域区划方面打下了基础，农业气象方面，也与热带资源开发结合起来，开始了综合性的考察工作。
    1956年上半年，在中共中央和国务院的领导下，制订了我国十二年科学远景规划。发展中国的气象事业是国家的一项重要科学技术任务。为了完成这项任务，在总述国际先进水平和国内现状的基础上，提出了若干科学中心问题，以及具体措施、大体进度和干部培养方案，这样，就把我国气象科学的发展正式纳入了为社会主义建设服务的轨道，使全国气象工作者有了宏伟壮丽的前景。这是我国气象发展的重要关键。
    1958年春季，在整风运动和反右斗争的胜利基础上，全国掀起了一个史无前例的大跃进。在工农业大跃进迫切需要科学技术革新的形势下，我国气象科学又走上一个新的飞跃阶段。根据大形势预告和区域预告并结合了当地的地理、地形特点，天气、气候规律和群众经验，云南镇雄等站创造了补充预报方法并在全国范围推广，使地方天气预告准确率有显著的提高，这是气象科学广泛深入结合生产的创举。此外，为了配合全国大跃进，气象科学研究机关也走上了跃进的道路。天气图的长期预报有了新的发展，西北干旱地区的气候改造，人工降雨等空白科学部门以及为解决西北干旱而开展的祁连山的融冰化雪工作也都提上日程，有实践意义而又有高度理论性的问题也开始注意研究。
    十年来我国气象科学研究的成就，可以分为以下几个方面：
    天气学
    天气学在“天气分析必须结合中国天气实际”的方针指导下，我国气象工作者发展创造了一套适用于我国西部高原地区的天气分析方法，发现了中国锋面和气旋活动的特殊性，批判了简单套袭挪威学派的天气分析方法。通过一系列的研究工作，我们对于东亚主要天气系统的物理过程和统计特征，有了比较系统的认识。这些研究成果是在我国天气预报业务迅速发展的条件下获得的，对于提高我国天气预报的准确率起了很大作用。
    在天气预告业务中，最迫切需要解决的是危险性天气的预告。其中寒潮、霜冻、台风、暴雨，是气象工作者研究的重点。许多研究从大范围环流型式变化、天气过程着眼，通过实例和统计分析来研究寒潮的爆发，以及由于冷空气活动而产生的降水。这些研究对于预告寒潮有实践的意义。另一方面的研究，则集中于夏季降水预告。1954年6、7两月江淮流域出现了百年来最大的洪水，1956年夏季松花江流域洪水对于人民生命财产都引起了损失。我国气象工作者，为了协助防汛和调节水利工程枢纽，在解放初期就注意到降水预报的研究工作。在这些研究工作里，对于雨区移动、华北雷雨和冷空气活动，冷锋、阻塞高压和冷涡，季风、热低压、暖锋和台风天气系统以及太平洋大型天气与中国降水的关系进行讨论，不少论著还发表了关于长江流域的中下游6、7月里所发生的梅雨的降水过程、暴雨性质、气团活动等的研究结果。通过这一系列的工作，我国的夏季降水预告从1953年起逐渐建立起来，对生产实践起了重要作用。由于台风在夏秋两季侵袭我国东南沿海，常造成很大的损害，气象工作者特别重视台风的研究。在大量研究工作里，讨论了台风移动路径和台风活动与大气环流的关系，台风生成的过程，统计性的规律以及台风的结构和分析方法。此外，还对霜冻、大风、冰雹等危险天气也进行了不少研究工作，为提高天气预告准确率创造了条件。
    在航空气象方面，对于凝结尾迹，空中能见度的预报，中国上空急流分析，积冰条件，高原地形颠簸等都积累了一定的经验和资料，进行了一些理论研究。
    中长期天气预告
    中国短期天气预告水平的迅速提高，对于保证国民经济各个部门任务的完成起了很大作用。但是，一到两天的预告还不能满足企业部门工作部署上的需要。因此，中长期预告在解放以后就逐渐提到气象工作的日程上了。在学习苏联中长期预告方法的基础上，进行了系统性的研究。它的结果是：确定了亚洲自然天气周期的存在，并指出它比欧洲的自然周期短和移动性系统多的特点；提出划分自然天气区域的论证，指出自然天气区域可因季节不同而使天气过程有所改变；分析寒潮爆发的过程，作出了路径的分类；得出我国夏季自然周期中的降水分布和周期降水的预报规律。在这些研究的基础上，各级气象业务部门已经建立了中期天气预告的业务。
    在长期预告方面，解放初期曾经有一些研究工作，从大气环流的范式以及海水温度分布等方面，来研究过去特大水旱灾年月的情况。这些研究对于长期预告虽然十分需要，但还不足以建立长期预告业务。此后，研究工作者根据多年气候资料，从气象要素的历史变化的统计特征，提出了一个一年以前即可作出的月平均值预报方案。预报的准确率在趋势方面约为75％，对农林水利部门起了一定参考作用，但对于天气过程发展的本身及其因果关系并不了解。此外，一些学者在苏联穆尔坦诺夫斯基学派的基础上，从东亚自然天气周期分类着手，找出各类周期的韵律及其前后演变序列的关系，提出一个季节内自然天气周期演变序列长期预告方法。中央气象科学研究所已采用这个方法发布1959年季节预告，效果尚待考验。
    1958年在大跃进基础上，全国气象台、站和研究单位大量开展了中长期预告的研究。从当地气候资料出发，或者从天气图资料出发，或者从劳动人民的经验出发，提出了多种多样的中长期预告方法，在1958年10月中央气象局召开的兰州会议上集中讨论，互相观摩，为今后进一步提高中长期预报的效果打下了良好的基础。另外一些气象工作者根据大气环流季节变化的各种特征所表现的规律性，提出了一个长期降水预告方法，在1959年用这个方法试作了十天到半年的预告，效果也有待考验，方法也有待于考验后修正补充。
    数值预告
    在掌握了天气演变的物理过程和区域的特征的基础上，对天气方程进行数学计算，是把天气预告从经验和定性的范畴引导到客观、定量阶段应走的道路。中国气象工作者在国内台、站建立一般天气预告业务有了基础以后，及时地把一部分注意力放到了这个方向。
    大气的环流
    天气系统的演变，是天气预告中的主要研究对象，同时也是大气环流组成部分。研究大气环流对于天气服务以及基本理论都有重要的意义。解放以后，大量探空和地面气象资料的积累，使我们有条件并用高空等压面和垂直剖面图等工具弄清楚东亚大气环流的结构。东亚上空冬季存在着两支急流，南支急流在季节变化中突然的出现和消逝，显示出大气环流动力结构的非线性，这种跳跃性的季节转换控制着中长期天气过程演变的程序，使我们有可能把它应用于中长期天气预告。西藏高原是地球表面上的最大障碍物，它对于中国天气和气候以至整个北半球大气环流，有极深厚的影响。十年来，我们对高原方面的研究投入不少人力，取得相当好的成绩。最近写出的西藏高原气象学，是我们对于西藏高原影响大气环流的研究的一个总结。这方面的研究成果，不但有学术价值，而且是有实际意义的。
    气候学
    解放以后，社会主义经济建设的迅速发展，推动了我国气候学的研究。气候是许多建设事业中需要考虑的自然因子之一。所以，各个生产部门对于气候资料、图集和气候学的研究的要求越来越普遍。在新中国建国以后的最初几年，对于整理气候资料、编绘气候图集投下了相当大的力量，同时在新的气候资料的基础上，进行了多方面的气候学问题的研究。我国气候学的成就有以下几个方面：第一，是各类新的气候图集，这些新的图集一方面对生产部门提供了气候资料，另一方面也是气候研究中不可缺少的工具；第二，是我国各个地区的气候特征与基本建设有关的气候分析以及各流域规划的气候特征和暴雨分析的研究，这方面工作的数量很多，中央和各个省都有不少工作；第三，是气候区划的工作，作出了我国比较细致的二、三级气候区划；第四，是东亚季风问题的研究，解放后这方面的工作也不少，其中一部分工作是弄清楚东亚季风的特点，另一部分工作是研究在季风和地形影响下东亚大气环流的特征，这方面的工作和大气环流有着紧密的联系；第五，是有关气候形成问题的研究，在热平衡和水分平衡等问题上我们作了一些工作。
    农业气象
    对华南特种经济作物引种中的气候适应问题，进行了多方面的研究。从小气候控制的观点，提出了防护林带的营造方案，北移的气候和地形条件的调查以及宜林地点的选择。创造了多种农业气象仪器，初步定出了农业气象观测方案，提出了稻、麦、棉、大豆、油菜生长发育期间的温度指标鉴定，并对它们的主要发育期以及收获期的预告进行了研究。对于流传于我国农民中的流冻水、风障、早春顶凌耙地、镇压田地等农业技术措施，通过小气候观测证明，这些都是可以提高有利的气象效应的措施。此外，还进行了农业灾害天气防预方法的研究。在农业气候方面，有许多省已经初步作出了全省农业气候区划。
    大气物理
    在国际地球物理年期间，我们已开始了臭氧的观测，并为观测夜光云准备条件。又如，在近面层大气物理方面，对低层大气层中的气象要素分布特征，进行了理论计算，取得了一些成果。应该提出的是人工降水和云雾物理工作的开展。这项工作是大跃进的一个具体的成果，在敢想敢干的行动下，吉林开始了我国第一次人工造雨的试验，取得了成效。随后甘肃、河北、武汉、安徽和江西等省也先后作了人工降雨试验，并已初步建立了两个高山云雾台，这是我国人工降水工作的良好开端。
    气象科学研究的特点
    回顾十年来中国气象研究的进展，我们认为以下几点应该特别提出来。
    第一，十年来中国气象学研究的最大特点是密切地和国民经济相配合，中国气象工作者虽然密切地注意全世界气象学必然的趋势，但我们研究的对象是解决在社会主义建设中的重大气象学问题。因此，我们的气象学是在中国的土壤上滋长繁荣起来的。更确切点说，中国气象学迅速的成长，是中国气象工作者坚决拥护党的“科学结合生产需要，理论联系实际”的号召的结果。在解放初期，我们看到必须建立新中国气象业务，通过业务的建立来带动研究。当时研究机关以大部分的力量投入联合天气分析预告中心和联合资料室。我们大部分的问题是从气象业务当前需要和今后的发展而提出来的。这些问题的解决不仅推动了气象业务的发展，也提高了我国气象科学水平，开辟了气象研究的阵地。十年来许多气象研究工作的开展，都标志着理论解决实际问题，实际问题的解决又带动和发展了理论研究的特点。今后，科学的发展可能随着客观情况而有所不同，但是理论联系实际的原则是不会改变的。
    第二，1956年国家制定了十二年科学远景规划，使中国气象学纳入了社会主义建设的道路。同时，通过科学计划的规定，使业务、教学、研究三方面结合成为一个有机整体，调动一切可以调动的力量，便于保证当前科学研究重点任务的完成，也便于布置基本理论长远发展的步骤。所有这些是和党的领导分不开的。没有党的领导，要使科学的发展和国家经济计划协调一致，是不可能的。
    第三，广大群众的发动，是推动中国气象科学的一个大动力。在去年工农业生产大跃进中，为了高额大面积的丰产，气象条件的保证是一个重要关键。人民需要气象学，几乎每个公社里都有群众自办的气象站或气象哨；气象学也的确为人民解决了一些问题。这样就使几百万劳动人民的生产活动和气象工作结合起来了。去年各地台、站的天气补充预告、农业气象、局部天气控制等工作与广大群众的推动支持都是分不开的。这样高速度的发展，如果没有党的总路线的光辉照耀，大跃进的号召，以及党的群众路线的指导思想，要取得这样的成就是不可能的。这一事实就彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义分子对大跃进的诬蔑。
    第四，近代气象学的发展，是和运用物理学的新成就分不开的，但十年来利用近代新技术来研究气象微观过程的一套试验技术，在我国还没有完全建立起来。缺乏这一套工具就限制了我们在气象科学领域内向纵深的方向发展。因此，今后必须努力于这一套技术系统的建立。再一个问题，我们过去对于天气系统描述性的工作做了不少，对于国民经济建设起了很大作用，今后我们仍需要进一步揭露大、中、小各种尺度天气过程的物理特征，从而掌握规律，把天气预报的准确率提高，在较长的时期以内就能对灾害性的天气作出了正确的长期预告。这是我们当前的最大问题，也是我们应当努力的方向。但气象学总的趋势是向运用新技术和加强物理基础的方向发展。因此，今后通过理论研究、模型试验、天气分析等方法来进一步揭露天气变化的物理机制，运用近代新技术在了解云雾物理的微观过程的基础上，来掌握自然降水的法则，是我们今后气象研究的一个重要方向。
