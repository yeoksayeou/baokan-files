Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 7th: The fishing areas along the coast of Guangdong have sent thousands of boats out to sea ahead of schedule to welcome the autumn fishing season.

Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, fishing areas in Guangdong have revised their production targets, determined to achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn fishing season. The Shantou Special District, after carefully analyzing the fish season, fishing boats, and labor force, set a goal of producing 1.5 million dan of fish within forty days starting from late August. In the Zhanjiang Special District, the first secretaries of the Party committees of seventeen fishing ports and communes personally went on board to direct production, with 80% of the Party committee members accompanying the boats. They adopted a comprehensive fishing method combining deep, medium, and shallow sea operations, determined to fight hard in September to seize one million dan of fish to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day. After listening to the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the fishermen of Hong Kong, Huiyang County, were all invigorated. On August 30 alone, they caught more than 6,000 dan of fish, a threefold increase compared to the usual daily output. In the Shantou Special District, after the publication of the resolutions of the Party Central Committee, more than 35,000 dan of fish were caught within five days, greatly exceeding the previous output.

Before the autumn fishing season, the coastal fishing areas of Guangdong, through the study of anti-Rightist sentiments and the promotion of drive, summed up the experience of the first half of the year and criticized the Right-leaning conservative ideas of a few cadres who emphasized difficulties. They immediately carried out preparations for the autumn fishing season, such as repairing boats and mending nets. The Hainan fishing area adopted the method of using local materials to process fishing supplies on the spot, and timely overcame the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The entire region also set up six "笏缆" (bamboo rope) processing factories in areas rich in bamboo to strive for self-sufficiency in "笏缆". The Beihe People's Commune in Leinan County fully mobilized and relied on the masses, raised 15,000 yuan of funds, and completed the repair of boats and mending of nets one month ahead of schedule. Thanks to the full mobilization of the enthusiasm of the broad masses, the work of repairing boats and mending nets in the major fishing areas of the province has been basically completed. At the same time, under the call of the Party, a red banner competition movement to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced has recently been launched in the coastal fishing areas. There are now nineteen counties and cities, fifty-six communes, and one hundred and ninety-three production brigades that have launched interconnected competitions, promoting the surging tide of autumn fishing production to advance wave after wave.

According to Xinhua News Agency: After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the famous Zhoushan fishing grounds in our country suddenly boiled over. The broad masses of fishermen held meetings and put forward the battle slogan of "Autumn fishing catches up with summer fishing, slack season catches up with peak season," determined to respond to the call of the Party with actions of catching one million dan of fish.

Now, a vigorous production increase movement is unfolding in various places. The members of the Gaoting Commune rushed to prepare tools for two days and nights and invested in autumn crab production half a month ahead of schedule. The average output of small teams in the autumn fishing season of the Dongji People's Commune in the Zhongjieshan Islands has reached 400 dan. At present, they are shifting their efforts to vigorously grasp multiple fishing methods, determined to break through the unit output of 1,000 dan per small team in the autumn fishing season. After studying the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session, the fishermen of the Shengsi Islands quickly arranged and adjusted their labor force and boats, using all available boats, tools, and manpower to increase the number of boats going to sea and catch more aquatic products to supply the market.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 7th: Inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee, more than 10,000 male and female fishermen in eight fishing production brigades and one state-owned fishing production group in Lüsi Fishing Port, Jiangsu, are in high spirits and have put forward the battle slogan of "Compete with Zhoushan, surpass Hupu, and strive to win the national championship."

After enthusiastically discussing the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the fishermen of the Sixth Fishing Production Brigade of Lüsi Port first unanimously decided to increase the plan to produce 30,000 dan of jellyfish, hairtail, crab, shrimp, and shellfish in the second half of this year to 41,000 dan, and strive to complete 54,000 dan, and issued a competition initiative to all fishing production brigades in the port. All major brigades also actively revised their targets and responded to the initiative of the Sixth Brigade. A heated socialist labor competition was launched between boats. The workers of the shipyard, woodworking factory, and fishing net processing factory also put forward plans to complete production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill quotas. Three hundred and forty workers from the woodworking factory brought tools and materials to the beach to repair ships, ensuring that they were repaired as soon as they arrived. At present, eighty-eight large fishing boats have been repaired throughout the port, thirteen motorized sailing boats have been refitted and added with nails, one hundred and forty-five sampans have been added and repaired, and more than 70% of the task of increasing and repairing fishing boats has been completed. More than 700 female workers from fifteen fishing net processing factories are also working day and night to make thread ropes, actively processing new-style single-anchor purse seines, "荡空网" (drifting nets), hairtail nets, and trawls.

In order to ensure the completion of the leap forward targets, the fishermen tried every means to tap labor potential and carry out technological innovations. Many fishing brigades have adopted the method of using multiple nets on one boat. Hairtail fishing boats carry both fishing nets and "荡空网" (drifting nets) and trawls, catching fish whenever they see them, returning with full loads, greatly increasing the output.
