Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 30th: Guizhou Province's more than eight million mu of corn are successively maturing, and during the harvesting process, news of large-scale bumper harvests continues to pour in. In the high-altitude and cold Bijie Special Zone, as of August 21st, 24,518 mu of corn had been harvested, with yields generally increasing by 20% to 50% compared to last year. In the Wenjiadian Commune of Sinan County, where the soil is thin and infertile, as of August 26th, 16,520 mu of corn had been harvested, with an average yield increase of more than 30% compared to last year. Among them, a 1,529-mu experimental plot achieved an average yield of 1,190 jin per mu.

Corn is the staple food of the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province, second only to rice. This year, shortly after the corn planting ended, disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and pests followed one after another, but people's communes in various regions mobilized more than four million people to fight disasters, ensuring the normal growth of corn. At the same time, people's communes in various regions strengthened field management of corn, and many communes established a dedicated person responsibility system. The Bijie Special Zone established field management technical organizations with the participation of experienced farmers from the county to the production team. The corn in Fa'er Commune of Shuicheng County, due to dedicated management, generally underwent weeding five times and topdressing four times; during the flowering period, artificial pollination was generally carried out two to three times, and half of the corn was implemented with the insertion of sticks to eliminate empty stalks. Therefore, the corn grew better than in any previous year. The 126 mu of harvested corn, after inspection and acceptance by the county party committee and commune party committee inspection team, actually yielded 128,036 jin of dry corn kernels, with an average yield of 1,016 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th: Qinghai Province's more than four million mu of spring wheat and highland barley have yielded a bumper harvest. The river valley areas of Minhe, Ledu, Xunhua, Hualong, Jianzha, Guide and other counties along the Yellow River and Huangshui River have been basically harvested. According to the trial threshing results in the harvested areas, the average yield per mu has generally increased by 10% to 20% or more compared to last year.

Large-scale high yields are a common feature of this year's spring wheat and highland barley harvest. The average yield per mu of more than 1,300 mu of highland barley and other crops in Gaomiao Brigade of Gaomiao Commune in Ledu County increased by 25.75% compared to last year; the average yield per mu of more than 153 mu of spring wheat in Dazhuang Production Team of Dongfeng Commune in Xunhua Salar Autonomous County increased by 76.97% compared to last year. In addition, many high-yielding fields have emerged in various regions.

This year, all regions have closely focused on the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and have been working very hard and meticulously from spring sowing to field management. Farmers of all ethnic groups overcame difficulties such as abundant rainfall, many weeds, and busy farm work, launched a mass movement for large-scale high yields, and vigorously grasped field management, laying a good foundation for this year's agricultural bumper harvest. In the harvesting process, various professional teams were organized in various regions, and methods such as cooperation between mountain and plain labor were widely used to achieve "harvesting a piece when it's ripe, quick harvesting, quick transportation, quick threshing, quick storage, and returning every grain to the home," making the harvesting speed faster than in any previous year.

    贵州玉米大面积丰收
    文家店公社千亩试验地平均亩产1190斤
    青海春小麦、青稞比去年增产
    新华社贵阳30日电　贵州省八百多万亩玉米相继成熟，在收割过程中，不断传出大面积丰收的喜讯。地处高寒的毕节专区，到8月21日止，已收玉米二万四千五百一十八亩，单产一般都比去年增加二成到五成。在土质瘦薄的思南县文家店公社，到8月26日止，已收玉米一万六千五百二十亩，平均亩产比去年增产三成多，其中有一千五百二十九亩试验地，平均亩产达到一千一百九十斤。
    玉米是贵州省各族人民仅次于大米的主粮。今年玉米播种结束不久，水旱风虫等灾害就接踵而来，但各地人民公社出动了四百多万抗灾大军，保证了玉米的正常生长。同时，各地人民公社都加强了对玉米的田间管理，许多公社建立了专人负责制。毕节专区自县到生产队，普遍建立了有老农参加的田间管理技术组织。水城县法耳公社的玉米由于有专人管理，一般做到薅草五次，追肥四次；在扬花期间，普遍进行了二至三次人工授粉，并有半数玉米实行了插签，消灭空秆，因此玉米长得比过去任何一年都好。已收割的一百二十六亩玉米，经县委和公社党委检查团验收结果，实收干玉米粒十二万八千零三十六斤，平均亩产一千零一十六斤。
    新华社西宁30日电　青海省四百多万亩春小麦、青稞丰收。黄河、湟水两岸民和、乐都、循化、化隆、尖扎、贵德等县川水地区已经基本收完。根据已经收割地区的试打结果，平均亩产量普遍比去年增产一成到两成以上。
    大面积丰产是今年春小麦、青稞收获中的一个普遍特点。乐都县高庙公社高庙大队一千三百多亩青稞等作物的平均亩产量，比去年增加25.75％；循化撒拉族自治县东风公社大庄生产队一百五十三亩多春小麦，平均亩产量比去年增加76.97％。此外，各地还出现了许多高额丰产田。
    今年，各地紧紧围绕农业“八字宪法”，从春播到田间管理都一直抓得很紧，搞得很细。各族农民克服了雨水广、杂草多、农活繁忙等困难，开展了群众性的大面积丰产运动，大抓田间管理，给今年的农业丰产打下了良好的基础。在收割中各地都组织了各种专业队，并广泛运用山地和川地劳力协作等办法，作到黄一块、割一块，力争“快收、快运、快打、快入仓、颗粒还家”，使收打速度比以往任何一年都快。
