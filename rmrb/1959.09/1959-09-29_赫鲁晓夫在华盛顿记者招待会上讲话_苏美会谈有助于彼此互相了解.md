Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 28th - TASS reports from Washington: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington on the 27th.

Speaking about his impressions of his visit to the United States, Khrushchev said that he met with the U.S. President, U.S. politicians and social figures, business people, and ordinary Americans. Our talks were direct and frank. This was beneficial and will help us to understand each other better. Khrushchev said that, of course, you are primarily interested in my impressions of the talks with Eisenhower. These were pleasant talks, and we shared many common views on all the issues we discussed, both in our assessment of the situation and on the need to improve relations between our two countries.

Khrushchev said that he had no doubt that the President sincerely hoped to improve relations between our two countries. He felt that the U.S. President was in a more complex environment than himself. Obviously, in the United States, there are still very influential forces that obstruct the improvement of relations between our two countries and hinder the relaxation of international tensions. This cannot be ignored. But I believe that reason will ultimately point out a correct course for resolving international issues, aimed at strengthening world peace. Meetings with business people in your country have shown that there is mutual concern for restoring relations and ties that would benefit any country, and these meetings have also made it possible to calmly discuss ways to replace military production with peaceful production.

Khrushchev continued, "I have a lot to say about meetings with workers and farmers, with university students and your intellectuals. I like your people, who, like the Soviet people, hope for peace and the prevention of new wars. They want to better understand the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in order to leverage the enormous potential of our two countries to benefit people and improve international relations."

Khrushchev then said, "Everywhere I have been asked if I like your way of life. Of course, I prefer our way of life. But I don't want to upset you. Frankly, regardless of the differences in our two countries' ways of life, we can still cooperate very well on the international stage. Since we were able to have good relations in the years of the joint struggle against a common enemy, there are no insurmountable obstacles to restoring and developing such cooperation on the stage of the struggle for peace."

After concluding his speech, Khrushchev answered many questions from the reporters present.

In answering questions, Khrushchev said that he had always believed that if people are committed to guaranteeing peace, then peace will be guaranteed.

The first question posed to Khrushchev was about the prospects for the development of Soviet-U.S. trade. In answering this question, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers emphasized that the Soviet Union is an extremely powerful industrial country, and the development of its industry, science, and technology will guarantee the production of all kinds of goods. Khrushchev said that we hope to buy what we are interested in and sell what you are interested in. This does not exclude consumer goods, as well as machinery and equipment.

Khrushchev then answered a question about cultural exchanges. He pointed out that the Soviet Union is willing to expand such exchanges, and the United States would also be willing to do so.

In answering another question, Khrushchev explained the Soviet Union's position on the German peace treaty issue. Khrushchev said that after night comes day, and after war comes peace. Therefore, it is clear that everyone must conclude peace treaties with both Germanys, because there is no unified Germany now. There is no other way out, I see no other way out.

Someone at the meeting also asked about the reasons for Eisenhower postponing his visit to the Soviet Union until next spring.

Khrushchev jokingly answered this question by saying that he had met several of the President's grandchildren, and they hoped to accompany their grandfather to Moscow. Khrushchev added that he thought this would be better for the President, especially for the grandchildren, since everything flourishes in the spring, emits fragrant scents, and nothing is in a frozen state. Subsequently, the head of the Soviet government answered a question about the possibility of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, saying: "I have always believed that reason should make people of all countries feel that we should coexist, we should live peaceful lives, we should be friendly and develop our friendly relations. I stood on such a position in the past, and now I am more firmly adopting such a position."

    赫鲁晓夫在华盛顿记者招待会上讲话
    苏美会谈有助于彼此互相了解
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫27日在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部举行记者招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到他这次访问美国的观感时说，我会见了美国总统，会见了美国政界人士和社会名流，会见了商界人士和普通的美国人。我们的谈话是直截了当和开诚布公的。这是有益的。这将有助于我们彼此更好地互相了解。赫鲁晓夫说，当然，你们首先感到兴趣的是我对于同艾森豪威尔会谈的印象。这是令人愉快的会谈，在我们所涉及的一切问题上，无论是在对局势的估计上，还是在必须改善我们两国关系方面，我们都有许多共同的见解。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我毫不怀疑，总统先生真诚地希望改善我们两国之间的关系，我觉得，美国总统所处的环境比我复杂得多。显然，在美国，有一派势力还很有影响，他们阻挠改善我们两国的关系，阻挠缓和国际紧张局势，这是不能不加以考虑的。但是我认为，理智终究会在解决国际问题方面指出一条以加强世界和平为目的的正确方针。同你们国家工商界人士的会见表明，彼此都关心恢复对任何一个国家都会带来好处的关系和联系，这些会见还使得有可能平心静气地讨论一下用和平生产代替军事生产的方法问题。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，关于同工人和农民、同大学生和你们的知识分子的会见，我想要说的非常之多。我喜欢你们的人，他们同苏联人一样希望和平和防止新战争。他们希望更好地了解苏联和苏联人民，以便发挥我们两国的巨大潜力，来造福人们，改善国际关系。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，到处都有人问我是否喜欢你们的生活方式。我当然更喜欢我们的生活方式。但是我不想使你们伤心。坦率地说，不管我们两国的生活方式有什么不同，我们还是可以在国际舞台上很好地合作的。既然在反对共同敌人的联合斗争的年代里，我们能够有良好的关系，那么，在为和平而斗争的舞台上恢复和发展这种合作是没有任何不可逾越的障碍的。
    赫鲁晓夫结束自己的讲话后，在场的记者向他提出许多问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答问题时说，我一向相信，如果人们致力于保证和平，那么和平就将得到保障。
    向赫鲁晓夫提出的第一个问题是苏美贸易发展前途问题。苏联部长会议主席在回答这个问题时着重指出，苏联是一个极强大的工业国，它的工业、科学和技术的发展将可以保证生产一切种类的商品。赫鲁晓夫说，我们希望购买我们所感兴趣的东西，出售你们所感兴趣的东西。这并不排除消费品，以及机器和设备。
    赫鲁晓夫接着回答了关于文化交流的问题。他指出，苏联愿意扩大这种交流。美国也会愿意这样做。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答另一个问题时解释了苏联在对德和约问题上的立场。赫鲁晓夫说，黑夜过去以后就是白天，战争结束后就是和平。因此，显然所有人都得同两个德国缔结和约，因为现在没有一个统一的德国。没有别的出路，我没有看到别的出路。
    会上还有人问到艾森豪威尔把访苏日期推迟到明年春天的原因。
    赫鲁晓夫回答这个问题时开玩笑地说，他认识了总统的几个孙子，而他们希望能陪自己的爷爷到莫斯科去。赫鲁晓夫补充说，我想，这对总统来说，特别是对孙子们来说也更好些，春季里万物欣欣向荣，吐出芬芳的气息，没有任何东西处在冰冻的状态了。接着，苏联政府首脑回答了关于苏美两国和平共处和合作的可能性的问题，他说：我一直认为，理智应使各国人民感到：我们应当共处，应当过和平的生活，应当友好和发展我们的友好关系。我过去站在这样的立场上，现在更加坚定地采取这样的立场。
