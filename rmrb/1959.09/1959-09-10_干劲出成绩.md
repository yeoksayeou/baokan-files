Welcoming the First National Games

Achievements Come from Enthusiasm
By our reporters Zuo Hua, Zuo Ji, and Sha Yin

The competitions on the sports field are contests of fighting will, confidence, and enthusiasm. Teams with ample enthusiasm and strong fighting will and confidence can often defeat stronger teams. The results of the first three rounds of the basketball finals at the National Games once again prove this point. Among the twenty-four men's and women's teams participating in the basketball finals, there are Class A, Class B, and Class C teams. However, after studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, everyone was in high spirits, and every team was full of enthusiasm. They were not arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. Class B or Class C teams constantly defeated Class A teams, and Class A teams worked hard to achieve even higher levels. This made the entire final situation unpredictable, and the competition became increasingly intense.

	Boosting Enthusiasm

A strong women's basketball team from the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the Yunnan Women's Basketball Team, encountered one of the strong northern teams, the Hebei Women's Basketball Team, in their first match.

Since 1956, the Yunnan women's team had consistently been defeated by the Tianjin women's team for three years. This year, the Tianjin team merged with the Hebei team to form the Hebei women's team, which has three national players and even greater strength. Initially, the Yunnan team members lacked confidence in their first match. Later, they held several team meetings, and after repeated discussions and detailed analysis of the "enemy situation," they believed that the key to the match against the Hebei team was to demonstrate confidence and enthusiasm. They put forward the battle cry of boosting enthusiasm, sticking to the game, and resolutely winning the first battle. In terms of tactics, they analyzed the characteristics of the Hebei team and decided to block the opponent's tall center, play flexibly, play fast breaks, and play with a mobile center.

Having made full preparations from the ideological to the tactical level, the Yunnan women's team faced off against the Hebei women's team at 3:00 PM on the 4th. In the first half, the Yunnan team lost by three points, but the players remained full of enthusiasm, without being flustered or confused. At the start of the second half, they continued to strengthen their defense, actively compete for rebounds, and also strengthened their offense, adopting individual breakthroughs, giving full play to the players' strengths, and disrupting the Hebei team's offensive. The score was tied several times on the court. Finally, they defeated the Hebei team with a score of forty-three to forty-two.

	Not Discouraged by Defeat

The enthusiasm of the Guangdong men's basketball team was very noticeable in the finals. At the beginning of the finals, they lost the first round to the Sichuan team by fifty-seven to ninety-eight, and then lost the second round to the Liaoning team by seventy-five to eighty-nine. However, the players were still in high spirits, not discouraged at all, and actively prepared to face the Shanghai team.

In terms of "strength," the Shanghai team is a Class A team, with four athletes, skilled in basketball and rich in competition experience; the Guangdong team was only promoted from Class C to Class B last year, with only six second-level athletes, and they have not encountered many Class A teams.

On the evening of the 6th, the Guangdong team faced the Shanghai team in the third round. In the morning, all the team members held a "democratic meeting" to discuss tactical deployments. The team members analyzed that the strengths of the Shanghai team were: fast speed, skillful technique, and tacit cooperation. Many team members said that they wanted to play full-court press to disrupt the Shanghai team's offensive. According to general practice, it is rare for a "weak team" to use full-court press against a strong team, which requires not only fast speed, fast reaction, and good technique, but more importantly, a tenacious fighting will. Center Zhang Guanglu, who is two meters and two centimeters tall, did not say anything at first. He was thinking: "If I play full-court press, I will have to guard Zhou Minghao, a famous player from the Shanghai team, which will be a bit difficult." While the meeting was being debated, Zhang Guanglu suddenly spoke up: "Yes, full-court press!" Zhang Guanglu, who is relatively slow, was also full of confidence, and the tactical deployment was decided.

The Shanghai team did not expect the Guangdong team to dare to play full-court press, and their formation was a bit chaotic from the beginning of the match, and their technique could not be brought into play. After more than eight minutes, the Shanghai team called a timeout and immediately changed their tactics; but the Guangdong team also responded on the spot and changed to zone defense. Although the Shanghai team led all the way, the Guangdong team chased closely, and the score was very close. In the last five minutes, the Shanghai team was still leading by ten points (sixty-six to fifty-six). At this time, the Guangdong team used full-court press again under adverse circumstances, and quickly attacked as soon as they got the ball. Sure enough, they chased to seventy-five points in one breath by the end of the game. After two "overtime periods," they finally defeated the Shanghai team with a score of eighty-nine to eighty-seven.

	Breaking Superstition

"It's not bad that a women's basketball team from the mountains only lost by twenty points to the People's Liberation Army team!" This was the evaluation of many people after the Guizhou women's basketball team played against the People's Liberation Army team. Some members of the Guizhou team also thought: The People's Liberation Army team has seven athletes, and the Sichuan team, their second-round opponent, is also the best team in the Southwest in terms of technique. They are all Class A teams, and our Guizhou team is the seventh-ranked team in Class B. Losing to them by ten or twenty points is indeed "self-consoling." Complacency also appeared in the weak team.

Before and after arriving in Beijing, the Guizhou team had seriously studied the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. At that time, the team's leadership made several analyses and enlightenments targeting the team members' fear of strong teams, eliminating superstitious ideas. Now that this kind of thinking has reappeared, the team immediately conducted research, pointing out that fear of strong teams and loss of confidence is a manifestation of right-leaning thought, and unfounded complacency will further erode the fighting will. Therefore, strict criticism was made of "self-consolation." At the same time, the team also analyzed the tactics of the game, why they only lost five and three points in the first half of the two games, but lost more in the second half. Everyone believed that the main shortcoming was that they became timid later, and the team members did not dare to improvise boldly on the court, for fear of taking responsibility. Through this research, the reason was found. It turned out that right-leaning thought was still at play, and everyone had a clearer understanding.

The third round of the competition on the 6th was against the Hubei team, also a Class A team. After several studies to combat right-leaning tendencies, the team members behaved differently this time. Although the Hubei team had skillful cooperation and good collective defense, everyone was not timid, but dared to charge boldly, and found the weak point of the Hubei team's loose defense under the basket. The center then cut into the basket to shoot, frequently scoring and taking the lead. The Hubei team repeatedly launched quick counterattacks, which they were good at, but failed to deter their offensive will. It was not until the last seven seconds that the score was tied at fifty-five. But at that moment, the enthusiastic Guizhou team cut into the basket and scored a goal, ultimately defeating a Class A team with a score of fifty-seven to fifty-five.

专栏：迎接首届全运会

    干劲出成绩
    本报记者　佐华　作骥　莎荫
    运动场上的比赛，是战斗的意志、信心和干劲的比赛，干劲足的，战斗意志、信心坚强的，较弱的队往往可以把较强的队打败。全运会篮球决赛前三轮比赛的结果，再一次证明了这一论断。参加篮球决赛的二十四个男、女球队中，有甲级队、乙级队，也有丙级队。但是，大家学习了党的八届八中全会的文件，人人斗志昂扬，队队干劲十足，胜不骄，败不馁，不断出现了乙级队或丙级队战胜甲级队，以及甲级队发奋图强打出更高水平的情况。使得整个决赛形势变化莫测，战斗越打越紧张。
        鼓干劲
    来自云贵高原的一支女子篮球劲旅——云南女子篮球队，首战遇上了北方强队之一的河北女子篮球队。
    从1956年开始，云南女队三年来一直就是天津女队的“手下败将”。今年天津队又和河北队合并为河北女队，拥有三名国手，实力更强。起初，云南队的队员们对面临的第一场比赛信心不足。后来，开了几次队员会，经过反复讨论，具体分析了“敌情”，认为同河北队之战的中心是要打信心，打干劲。提出了鼓足干劲，盯住打，坚决打胜头一仗的战斗口号。在战术上，她们分析了河北队的特点，决定了封锁对方高个中锋，打灵活，打快攻，打活动中锋的一套战术。
    从思想上到战术上作了充分准备的云南女队，在4日下午三时和河北女队对垒。上半场云南队输了三个球，但队员们仍然干劲十足，不慌不乱。下半场开始，一方面继续加强防守，积极争夺篮板球，另一方面也加强了进攻，采用个人突破，发挥了队员的特长，打乱了河北队的攻势，场上比分几度拉平。最后终以四十三比四十二战胜河北队。
          败不馁
    广东男篮的干劲，在决赛中很引人注目。决赛一开始，第一轮对四川队以五十七比九十八输了，第二轮遇辽宁队又以七十五比八十九再败。可是，队员们仍然精神抖擞，毫不气馁，积极准备迎战上海队。
    论“实力”，上海队是甲级队，有四名运动健将，球艺娴熟，比赛经验丰富；广东队去年才由丙级队晋升为乙级队，只有六名二级运动员，许多甲级队他们都没有碰过。
    6日晚，广东队在第三轮遇上海队了。早上，全体队员开了个“民主会议”，讨论战术部署。队员们分析了上海队的长处是：速度快，技术熟练，配合默契。不少队员说，要打全场紧逼，来破坏上海队的攻势。按一般常规，“弱队”对强队采用全场紧逼是不多见的，这不但需要速度快，反应快，技术好，更重要的是要有顽强的战斗意志。身高二米零二的中锋张光禄起先没吭声，他考虑着：“打全场紧逼，自己要盯的是上海队名将周明镐，那有点困难。”会上正争论着，忽然，张光禄开腔了：“对，全场紧逼！”动作比较迟钝的张光禄也信心十足，战术部署就定了下来。
    上海队没料到广东队敢于打全场紧逼，比赛一开始阵脚就有点乱，技术发挥不出来。八分多钟，上海队叫暂停，立即改变打法；但广东队也临场应变，改为联防。虽然上海队一路领先，但广东队紧紧追赶，积分拉得很近，到最后五分钟，上海队还领先十分（六十六比五十六）。这时，广东队在劣势下又打全场紧逼，一得来球就快速进攻，果然，到终场时一口气追成七十五平。经过两个“决胜期”，终以八十九比八十七战胜上海队。
          破迷信
    “一个从山区来的女子篮球队，同解放军队比赛只输掉二十分，不算差了！”这是贵州女篮同解放军队比赛后，有不少人作这样的评价。贵州队的部分队员也这样想：解放军队拥有七个运动健将，就是第二轮的对手四川队，也是西南技术最好的劲旅，她们都是甲级队，我们贵州队是乙级队第七名，输给她们十来二十分，的确可以“聊以自慰”。在弱队里却也出现了自满情绪。
    贵州队在到京前后曾经认真地学习中共八届八中全会文件，队的领导当时针对队员们怕强队的思想，作了几次分析和启发，破除迷信思想。现在又出现这种思想，队里立即进行了研究，指出怕强队失去信心是右倾思想的表现，无根据地自满更将侵蚀战斗意志，因此对“聊以自慰”作了严格的批判。同时还分析了比赛的战术，为什么两场的上半场都只输五分和三分，而下半场却输多了。大家认为主要缺点是到后来缩手缩脚，队员在场上不敢大胆地临机应变，怕负责任。通过这么一研究，找到了原因，原来还是右倾思想在作怪，大家都认识得比较清楚了。
    6日第三轮比赛是对湖北队，又是一个甲级队。队员们经过多次反右倾的学习，这回临场不同了。尽管湖北队的配合熟练、集体防守很好，大家可不是缩手缩脚，而是敢于大胆猛冲，而且找着湖北篮下防守不严的弱点，中锋就猛切篮下投篮，频频得分领先。湖北队几次以擅长的快攻反击，都打不退她们猛攻的意志，到最后七秒钟，才打成五十五平。可是就在这一刹那间，干劲十足的贵州队又猛切篮下而投进一球，毕竟以五十七比五十五，把一个甲级队打败了。
