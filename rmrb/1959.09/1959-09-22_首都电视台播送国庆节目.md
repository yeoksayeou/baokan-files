The Capital Television Station is working intensely to arrange programs for the capital's audience during the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

From September 23rd to October 8th, the television station has tentatively determined the following main programs: On October 1st, the entire day will be devoted to live broadcasts of the National Day parade and celebrations in the capital. Viewers who did not participate in the parade can see crowds in festive attire carrying various real objects and charts illustrating the achievements of the past ten years of national construction passing through Tiananmen Square, as well as people singing and dancing under the colorful fireworks. During this period, the television station will also broadcast highlights from the National Arts Festival, including the famous Peking Opera performing artist Mei Lanfang starring in "Mu Guiying Takes Command," Cantonese opera stars Ma Shizeng and Hong Xiannv starring in "Guan Hanqing," the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe performing "Dream of the Red Chamber," the Bolshoi Ballet's "Swan Lake" and "Giselle," and the Beijing Dance School's "Le Corsaire." Excellent films dedicated to National Day, such as "The Storm," "Song of Youth," "Lin Zexu," "Young People in Our Village," and "The Story of an Old Soldier," will also be broadcast on television. Sports enthusiasts can also watch an exciting football match between the Soviet Union and Hungarian football teams held in Beijing.
