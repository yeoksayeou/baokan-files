Magnificent Museum
By our reporter Yu Huiyin

    The Museum of the Chinese Revolution and the Museum of Chinese History have been completed in the capital. It is located on the east side of the famous Tiananmen Square. Precious cultural relics from various historical periods and various development stages of the Chinese revolution will be displayed here as classrooms for carrying out patriotic education and revolutionary tradition education for the broad masses of the people.

    The two museums are closely connected to form a magnificent building. The highest point is nearly forty meters high, three hundred and thirteen meters long from north to south, and one hundred and forty-nine meters long from east to west. The total construction area is more than 60,000 square meters. The outer walls are light yellow, and the eaves around are inlaid with golden and emerald green glazed tiles from Foshan, Guangdong, which vividly outlines the entire building against the backdrop of the azure sky.

    Walking into the green square in front of the museum, a majestic colonnade stands facing you, composed of twelve pairs of giant columns with Chinese national style, reaching a height of 32.7 meters. This is the general entrance and exit of the two museums. On the horizontal plaque above the colonnade is embedded a large flag emblem that is 5.5 meters high and 26.5 meters wide. The center is a dazzling red five-pointed star, surrounded by red flag groups and yellow ears of wheat. On both sides of the porch are two gate piers, 39.88 meters high, with torch reliefs at the top. The torch is burning, which is a symbol of "a single spark can start a prairie fire."

    Gao Yunchao, the person in charge of the construction site, Zhang Kaiji, the chief architect, and Huang Qiaohong, the architect, introduced to us that the construction of these two museums has received strong support from all over the country. China's architectural circles once proposed more than 80 different design schemes. After heated discussions in dozens of large and small debates, the final scheme jointly designed by the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau Design Institute and Tsinghua University was selected, and opinions from various parties were absorbed for supplementation and improvement. The Fifth Construction Engineering Company of Beijing and workers sent from eighteen provinces and cities across the country to provide support displayed soaring enthusiasm in the construction process, overcame the heavy difficulties of large tasks, tight schedules, complex engineering projects, construction in winter and rainy seasons, etc., and completed the project in only ten months from groundbreaking to completion. After acceptance, the project quality was good and met the design requirements.

    Climbing the large colonnade along the 140-meter-wide granite steps, passing through the large courtyard specially used for the concentration and evacuation of visitors, and ascending the granite steps, you will arrive at the front hall. This is the interior transportation hub of the entire building. Entering the Museum of the Chinese Revolution to the north and the Museum of Chinese History to the south. The hall is surrounded by auxiliary rooms such as cloakrooms, VIP reception rooms, and mass service rooms.

    Going one floor further east from the center of the hall along the marble steps, you will arrive at the central hall. This is a solemn memorial hall, 32 meters wide and 42 meters deep. Bright and dazzling metal ears of wheat are connected into exquisite garlands on the glass doors. Two rows of sixteen huge light gray marble octagonal columns extend from the ground to the 15-meter-high dome. The white column heads are decorated with golden axes, sickles, and other ornaments.

    On the artificial marble wall on the front of the hall, there are relief portraits of the great teachers of the world's proletarian revolution, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Bright sunlight shines directly onto the reliefs and statues through the white hollowed-out skylights on the dome. On the walls on both sides are murals of "Great Unity of the People of the World" and "Great Unity of the Chinese People," which skillfully depict the intimate friendship, singing, and dancing of the Chinese people and the people of the world, using the traditional Chinese painting method of raised powder and gold lines. Opposite, on the wall at the entrance of the hall, there is a pattern of white doves of peace. The light green walls, light yellow wainscoting, and gray-yellow and red marble floors combine the entire hall harmoniously.

    Walking north and south through the passages on both sides of the front hall, you will arrive at the preface halls of the Museum of Chinese History and the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, which have similar architectural forms, respectively. The Museum of the Chinese Revolution in the north of the building and the Museum of Chinese History in the south are symmetrical and balanced in architecture. Each of the two museums has seventeen exhibition halls, distributed on the second and third floors. The total exhibition area is 23,000 square meters. Since these two museums require strict continuity in the display arrangement of exhibits, the architectural design of the exhibition halls adopts a single-sided display circular route. The exhibition route is 2 kilometers long in total. If you visit each item in the order of display, it will be as long as 6 or 7 kilometers.

    If the architectural style of the central hall is solemn and elegant, the characteristics of the exhibition hall are simple, bright, generous, and simple. Its indoor height reaches seven meters, which is more than twice that of general civil buildings. The exhibits displayed here will be mainly real objects, so the architectural design adopts three different spans of 12 meters, 14 meters, and 20 meters to make the exhibit layout very flexible. Various real objects of different sizes, such as ancient vehicles, bronze tripods, farm tools, wooden weaving machines, and the gallows used when revolutionary martyrs were killed, can occupy different display areas and make the building have different spatial changes. The interior walls of the exhibition hall are painted in soft and pleasing colors such as beige, light green, and light blue. Large white ceilings have no ornamentation, so that the audience's attention is all concentrated on the display content. One side of the exhibition hall displays exhibits, and the other side is a whole row of fixed steel glass windows, 5.8 meters high and 3.5 meters wide, and sufficient light can illuminate every corner.

    The exhibition halls also have mechanical ventilation and temperature and humidity adjustment equipment to adjust the air temperature. Warm air is sent in winter to keep the room temperature at around 18 degrees Celsius. Cold air is sent in summer to lower the temperature to around 25 degrees Celsius, so as to protect the exhibits from moisture or cracking, and at the same time make the audience feel comfortable in the hall. The floors of the exhibition halls are all made of brown rubber flooring successfully trial-produced in our country for the first time.

    This kind of floor has good wear resistance, is bright and clean, and is elastic, which helps to prevent moisture, dust, and sound absorption. The installation of rubber floors requires a very flat surface. Carpenters and tilers, who had never had experience in installing this kind of floor, learned as they worked, carefully checking the flatness with a ruler while making the ground, ensuring that the flatness deviation did not exceed 0.5 mm.

    In order to reduce the fatigue of visitors, the museum also arranged circular rest corridors with an area of 6,600 square meters on the inner and outer circles of the upper and lower exhibition halls, along the visiting route and the internal green courtyards. The rest corridor is 4 to 8 meters wide, and the light green walls and milky white chandeliers make it particularly elegant. The corridors will be lined with sofas, newspaper and magazine racks, and drinking fountains. Through the rows of wide glass windows that extend straight to the top, you can have an unobstructed view of the scenery of the north and south courtyards and the buildings in the courtyard, making people feel as if they are outdoors. Each exhibition hall has a door leading to the rest corridor. Through the rest corridor, you can go to the inner courtyard to walk, visit, or rest. These two north and south inner courtyards and the front courtyard in the middle are surrounded by colonnades, forming a group of green gardens, plus the green square in front of the main entrance and exit, forming a series of squares and courtyards from large to small and from outside to inside.

    The building also has some reading rooms, reference rooms, and warehouses for storing exhibits. All exhibits are strictly disinfected before being put into the warehouse. In the basement, there is also an auditorium that can accommodate 700 people, where revolutionary and historical lectures will be held and revolutionary and historical movies will be shown.

    In addition to the main entrance and exit on the front of the building, each museum has a main entrance and exit, and there are many evacuation exits around it leading to the streets.

    The Museum of the Chinese Revolution and the Museum of Chinese History will be officially opened soon. The long history of our great motherland for thousands of years and the glorious revolutionary course of hard struggle of our people will be reproduced here. It will powerfully encourage the 600 million people of our country to always strive forward. (Attached pictures)

    宏伟壮丽的博物馆
    本报记者　余辉音
    中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆在首都建成了。它位于著名的天安门广场的东侧。这里，将陈列我国各个历史时期和我国革命各个发展阶段的珍贵文物，作为向广大人民群众进行爱国主义教育和革命传统教育的课堂。
    这两个博物馆紧紧地连在一起，合成一座宏伟壮丽的建筑物。最高处的高度近四十米，南北长三百一十三米，东西长一百四十九米。全部建筑面积达六万多平方米。外墙是浅黄色的，四周的屋檐用广东佛山的琉璃砖镶成一圈金黄翠绿的花边，在蔚蓝色天空的映照下，分外醒目地勾划出整个建筑物的轮廓。
    走进博物馆前的绿化广场，迎面矗立着一座巍峨雄伟的大柱廊，它由十二对富有中国民族风格的巨型圆柱组成，高达三十二点七米。这是两个博物馆的总出入口。柱廊上部的横额上，嵌着一个高五点五米、宽二十六点五米的大旗徽。中间是鲜艳夺目的红色五角星，四周是红色的旗群和黄色的麦穗。门廊两侧是两个三十九点八八米高的大门墩，上端饰有火炬的浮雕。火炬在燃烧着，这是“星星之火，可以燎原”的象征。
    工地负责人高云超、总建筑师张开济、建筑师黄乔鸿向我们介绍说，这两个博物馆的建筑，得到了全国的大力支援。我国建筑学界曾经提出了八十多种不同的设计方案，经过大小几十次辩论会的热烈讨论，最后选择了北京市规划局设计院和清华大学合作的方案，同时吸取了多方面的意见作了补充和改进。北京市第五建筑工程公司和全国十八个省市派来支援的工人，在施工过程中发挥了冲天干劲，克服了任务大、工期紧、工程项目复杂、冬季和雨季施工等重重困难，从破土开工到完工，只用了十个月的时间，经过验收，工程质量良好，符合设计要求。
    沿着一百四十公尺宽的花岗石大台阶登上大柱廊，穿过专供参观者集中疏散用的大院，踏着花岗石台阶拾级而上，就来到正门厅前。这是整个大厦的室内交通枢纽，向北进入中国革命博物馆，向南进入中国历史博物馆。门厅周围设有衣帽间、贵宾接待室、群众服务室等附属用房。
    由门厅正中向东沿大理石台阶再进一层，便来到了中央大厅。这是一个庄严的纪念性大厅，它有三十二米宽，四十二米深，一枝枝光彩夺目的金属麦穗，在玻璃大门上联成了精美的花环。两排十六根巨大的浅灰大理石八角柱，由地面直通到十五米高的顶穹，白色柱头上装有金色的斧头镰刀等雕饰。
    大厅正面的人造大理石墙面上，有全世界无产阶级革命的伟大导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的浮雕头像。明亮的阳光，透过顶穹上白色镂花的天窗，直射到浮雕和塑像上。两侧壁上是“世界人民大团结”和“中国人民大团结”的壁画，用我国传统的立粉划金彩绘的画法，巧妙地描绘出我国人民和全世界人民亲密友爱、歌舞欢娱的景象。对面，大厅入口处的墙上，塑有白色和平鸽的图案。浅绿色的墙面，淡黄色的护墙，灰黄和红色的大理石地面，把整个大厅组合得很和谐。
    从正门厅两侧的过厅分别向南北穿行，便来到中国历史博物馆和中国革命博物馆的两个建筑形式相似的序言厅。大厦北部的中国革命博物馆，南部的中国历史博物馆，建筑上是对称和平衡的，两个博物馆各有十七个陈列厅，分布在第二、三层楼上。全部展览面积为二万三千平方米。由于这两个博物馆在展品陈列布置上都要求严格的连续性，陈列厅的建筑设计采用了单面陈列环行路线。展览路线共长二公里，如按展品陈列次序，逐个参观，那就长达六、七公里。
    如果说中央大厅建筑的风格是庄严、雅致，陈列厅的特色则是简洁、明朗、大方、朴素。它的室内高度达到七米，相当一般民用建筑的二倍以上。这里陈列的展品将以实物为主，所以在建筑设计上采取了十二米、十四米、二十米三种不同的跨度，使展品布置有很大的灵活性，古代的车辆、铜鼎、农具、木架织布机、革命烈士遇难时的绞架刑器，渡江胜利的帆船等各种大小不同的实物，都能占用不同的陈列面积，并且使建筑物具有不同的空间变化。陈列厅的内墙分别刷成米黄、淡绿、浅蓝等柔和悦目的色彩，大片洁白的顶棚不加任何花饰，使观众的注意力全部集中在陈列内容上。陈列厅的一边陈列展品，另一边是五米八高、三米五宽的整排固定玻璃钢窗，充足的光线可以照射到每个角落。
    陈列厅里还有机械通风和温湿度调节等设备，以调节空气冷热，冬天送来暖风，室温保持在摄氏十八度左右。夏天送来冷风，把温度降低到摄氏二十五度左右，这样就可以保护展品防止受潮或干裂，同时使观众在厅内感到舒适。陈列厅的地面，全部采用我国第一次试制成功的棕色橡胶地板。
    这种地板具有良好的耐磨性能，光亮细洁，富有弹性，有助于防潮防尘和吸音。安装橡胶地板，要求非常平整的地面，从来没有安装这种地板经验的木工和瓦工们边学边做，一面做地面，一面仔细地用靠尺检查平整情况，做到平整偏差不超过零点五公厘。
    为了减轻参观者的疲劳，博物馆还在上下两层陈列厅的内圈和外圈，顺着参观路线和内部绿化庭院，布置了面积达六千六百平方米的环行休息廊。休息廊有四米至八米宽，浅绿色的墙面，乳白色的吊灯，显得分外幽雅。廊内将贴墙布置沙发、书报杂志架、饮水处，透过整排直通到顶的宽大玻璃窗户，可以一览无余地看到南北二个内院的景色和院内的建筑，使人仿佛置身室外。每个陈列厅都有门通向休息廊，经过休息廊可以到内院里散步、游览或休息。这两个南北内院，和中部的门前大院用柱廊环绕在一起，联成一组绿化园地，加上总出入口前的绿化广场，形成由大到小、由外而内的一系列广场庭院。
    大厦里还有一些阅览室、资料室和存放展品的仓库，展品入库前一律经过严格的消毒。在底屋还有一个可以容纳七百人的礼堂，这里将举行革命、历史讲座，放映革命、历史电影。
    除了大厦正面的总出入口外，两个博物馆各有一个主要出入口，四周还有许多疏散口通向街道。
    中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆不久就要正式开放了。我们伟大的祖国几千年的悠久历史，我国人民艰苦奋斗的光荣的革命历程，将要在这里重现。它将有力地鼓舞着我国六亿人民永远发奋向前。（附图片）
