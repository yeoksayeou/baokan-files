Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 16th. On the day before the start of the "Mongolia-China Friendship Activities" (lasting fifteen days) in Mongolia (15th), the Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an article written by Sumiya, Minister of Culture of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, entitled: "The Leap Forward of the People's Republic of China in Socialist Construction."

The article said that the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution ten years ago was a great event of international significance that emerged after the Great October Revolution. The construction work carried out by the Chinese people in the past ten years is magnificent, and the face of the old, semi-colonial China has long disappeared.

The article said that the Chinese people victoriously realized the first five-year construction plan, laying a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In the first year of the second five-year plan, 1958, the Chinese people carried out an unprecedented Great Leap Forward and achieved great victories in socialist construction. Along with the Great Leap Forward, the people's communes emerged. More than 120 million Chinese farmers took a big step forward and formed more than 26,000 people's communes. The people's commune is a basic-level unit integrating workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and is the best form of transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people.

The article wrote that the great achievements China made in 1958 were not ordinary progress, but a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The Great Leap Forward is the product of the victory of the Chinese socialist revolution. A major decisive factor that contributed to the Great Leap Forward was the general line for building socialism put forward by the Chinese Communist Party.

The article said that on the basis of the achievements made by the Chinese people in 1958, they put forward magnificent targets for continuing the leap forward in 1959. The Chinese people are welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with great achievements in socialist construction. Every victory and achievement of China has further strengthened and consolidated the forces of peace in the Far East and the world, and strengthened the forces of the socialist camp. The Mongolian people are filled with joy for every victory and achievement of China's Great Leap Forward.

    蒙古人民革命党中央文化部长苏米亚撰文说
    总路线促成了中国的大跃进
    新华社乌兰巴托16日电　在蒙古举行的“蒙中友好活动”（共十五天）开始的前一天（15日），蒙古“真理报”刊登了蒙古人民革命党中央委员会文化部长苏米亚写的文章，题目是：“中华人民共和国在社会主义建设中的跃进”。
    文章说，十年前中国人民革命的胜利是伟大的十月革命后出现的具有国际意义的巨大事件。十年来，中国人民进行的建设事业是宏伟的，半殖民地的旧中国的面貌早已消失了。
    文章说，中国人民胜利地实现了第一个五年建设计划，奠定了社会主义工业化的初步基础。在第二个五年计划的第一年，1958年，中国人民进行了史无前例的大跃进，取得了社会主义建设的巨大胜利。在大跃进的同时，出现了人民公社化，中国一亿二千多万户农户前进了一大步，组成二万六千多个人民公社。人民公社是工农商学兵一体的基层单位，是集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的最好形式。
    文章写道，中国在1958年取得的巨大成就不是平凡的前进，而是全面的大跃进。大跃进是中国社会主义革命胜利的产物。促成大跃进的一个主要决定性因素是中国共产党提出的建设社会主义的总路线。
    文章说，中国人民在1958年取得成绩的基础上，提出了1959年继续跃进的宏伟指标。中国人民正在以取得社会主义建设的巨大成就来迎接建国十周年。中国的每一个胜利和成就更加增强和巩固了远东和世界的和平力量，增强了社会主义阵营的力量。蒙古人民对中国大跃进的每一个胜利和成就都感到满腔的喜悦。
