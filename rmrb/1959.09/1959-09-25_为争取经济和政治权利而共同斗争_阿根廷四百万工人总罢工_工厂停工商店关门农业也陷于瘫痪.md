Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, September 23rd – Nearly four million workers in Argentina began a forty-eight-hour national general strike today. This is the largest strike by the Argentine working class this year.

　　Factories and industrial enterprises across the country have ceased operations due to the strike. 1.2 million agricultural workers have laid down their tools, paralyzing agriculture. Newspapers have ceased publication. Dockworkers, airport workers, and transportation workers have also joined the strike. With the participation of commercial employees and chefs in Buenos Aires, many shops, bars, and restaurants have closed. Staff at post offices, telephone companies, gas, electricity, petroleum, aviation, and hospitals have stopped working, leaving only a few to handle emergencies.

　　This strike was called by the "United Trade Union Committee," which includes the "62 Unions," the "Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement," and many independent unions. The strike is to support the wage increase demands made by metallurgical workers, textile workers, and other workers. Strikers are also demanding that the government fulfill the thirteen demands in the common struggle program proposed by the "United Trade Union Committee." These include: stopping price increases, reinstating dismissed workers, ceasing interference in trade unions, lifting martial law and abolishing all repressive laws, halting denationalization plans, and implementing land reform.

　　Before announcing the strike, the "United Trade Union Committee" sent representatives to meet with the Minister of Economy and Labor, Alsogaray, demanding that the government fully meet their demands, but without success.

　　This strike has received support from all levels of residents and several political parties in Argentina. Representatives from ninety organizations, including women's groups, business circles, youth organizations, and trade unions, held a meeting two days before the strike to express their support for the strike and decided to work together to combat high living costs. The Argentine Communist Party, the Buenos Aires Federation of the Socialist Party, and the "People's Intransigence Front" faction within the ruling Intransigent Radical Civic Union have all announced their support for the strike.

    为争取经济和政治权利而共同斗争
    阿根廷四百万工人总罢工
    工厂停工商店关门农业也陷于瘫痪
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯23日电　阿根廷将近四百万工人今天开始举行四十八小时全国总罢工。这是阿根廷工人阶级今年以来所举行的规模最大的一次罢工。
    全国的工厂和工业企业由于这次罢工而停止了活动。一百二十万名农业工人放下了工具，使农业也处于瘫痪状态。报纸都停止出刊。码头工人、飞机场工人和运输工人也参加了罢工行列。由于布宜诺斯艾利斯的商业雇员和厨师也参加了罢工，许多商店、酒吧间和饭店都关了门。邮局、电话、煤气、电力、石油、航空和医院等工作人员停止工作，只留下少数人应付紧急事务。
    这次罢工是在“工会联合委员会”的号召下举行的，参加这个组织的有“六十二工会”、“工会团结合作运动”和许多独立工会。举行这次罢工是为了支持冶金工人、纺织工人及其它工人提出的增加工资的要求。罢工者同时要求政府实现“工会联合委员会”提出的共同斗争纲领中的十三点要求。其中包括：制止物价上涨、恢复被解雇工人的工作、停止干涉工会、解除戒严状态和废除一切镇压法律、停止非国有化的计划和实行土地改革等。
      “工会联合委员会”在宣布这次罢工前，曾派代表会见经济兼劳工部长阿耳索加赖，要求政府能完全满足他们的要求，但是没有结果。
    这次罢工得到了阿根廷各阶层居民和若干政党的支持。妇女、商界、青年组织和工会等九十个组织的代表曾在罢工前两天举行集会，表示支持这次罢工，并决定为反对高昂的生活费而共同协力进行斗争。阿根廷共产党、社会党布宜诺斯艾利斯联合会、执政党不妥协激进公民联盟中的“人民不妥协阵线”派等组织都宣布支持这次罢工。
