Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: Today is the eve of the fifteenth anniversary of the Bulgarian people's great victory in the socialist revolution. This afternoon, people from all circles in the capital solemnly held a grand gathering to warmly celebrate the brilliant achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction, and to celebrate the growing fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people and the powerful unity of the socialist camp.

The celebration meeting was held in the Capital Theater. The national flags of China and Bulgaria were hung high on the rostrum, and the front of the stage was covered with flowers. Huge golden banners reading "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Bulgarian People!" and "Long Live the Unity of the Socialist Camp Headed by the Soviet Union!" radiated brightly under the strong lights. At 4 p.m., Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen and Chen Shutong, and others accompanied Bulgarian Ambassador to China Panchevski to the rostrum. At this time, the audience burst into thunderous applause, and more than a thousand representatives from all walks of life in the capital celebrated the glorious festival of the Bulgarian people together with the Bulgarian comrades.

The conference began after the national anthems of China and Bulgaria were played. Vice Premier Bo Yibo first spoke at the meeting (full text on page 3). On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, he extended the warmest congratulations to the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian government, and the Bulgarian people. He congratulated the Bulgarian people on the brilliant achievements they have made in the cause of building socialism over the past fifteen years, and pointed out that the Bulgarian people's efforts to complete the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in three or four years will make a significant contribution to the peaceful competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that the Bulgarian people have demonstrated a high degree of Marxist-Leninist principle and an unwavering proletarian stand in the struggle against modern revisionism, thus making valuable contributions to consolidating the unity of the world socialist camp and the international communist movement. Vice Premier Bo Yibo stated that the Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the Bulgarian government's various proposals aimed at safeguarding world peace.

Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that, like the Bulgarian people, our great motherland has also achieved brilliant achievements on the road of socialist construction. Now, the entire Chinese people are greeting the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with new labor achievements, and are striving to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year. Imperialists and all reactionaries have frantically issued various kinds of howls, attempting to shake the Chinese people's determination to accelerate socialist construction and undermine the international prestige of the People's Republic of China. However, facts will once again give them a merciless blow. All the shameless howls of reactionaries at home and abroad are in vain and will be met with new failures.

The audience welcomed Ambassador Panchevski's speech at the meeting (full text on page 3) with stormy and warm applause. The ambassador said in his speech that in the past fifteen years, the People's Republic of Bulgaria has changed from a backward agricultural country before liberation into a socialist industrial-agricultural country with large-scale cooperative and mechanized agriculture.

The ambassador said that in three weeks, the great Chinese people will celebrate the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy and excitement. We are all witnesses to the victorious advance of great China in the past ten years. In the past ten years, it has become a powerful socialist country - a loyal defender of peace in the Far East and the world.

Today's conference was jointly organized by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China-Bulgaria Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Chu Tunan, Deputy Director of the Foreign Culture Commission, presided over today's meeting. Also present at the meeting were Zeng Yongquan, Liu Changsheng, Xia Yan, Lin Haiyun, Liu Ruilong, Yang Hansheng, Liu Qingyang, Zhang Chao, Jia Tingsan, and other heads of relevant departments and people's organizations. Bulgarian experts, students studying in China, and diplomatic envoys and diplomats from various countries to China were invited to attend the meeting.

After the speeches, two song and dance troupes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed music and dance programs.

    首都各界代表一千多人举行盛大集会
    欢庆保加利亚人民的辉煌成就
    据新华社8日讯　今天是保加利亚人民取得社会主义革命伟大胜利的十五周年前夕。首都各界人民今天下午隆重举行盛大集会，热烈欢庆保加利亚人民在社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就，欢庆中保人民的兄弟友谊日益发展和社会主义阵营的强大团结。
    庆祝大会在首都剧场举行。大会主席台上高悬着中保两国国旗，台前布满鲜花。“中保两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”和“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”的巨幅金字标语，在强烈的灯光照耀下放射着光芒。下午四时，薄一波副总理，李济深、陈叔通副委员长等陪同保加利亚驻中国大使潘切夫斯基登上主席台。这时，全场掌声雷动，一千多首都各界代表同保加利亚同志一起，热烈地庆祝保加利亚人民的光辉节日。
    大会在高奏保中两国国歌以后开始。薄一波副总理在大会上首先讲话（全文见第三版），他代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向保加利亚共产党、保加利亚政府和保加利亚人民致以最热烈的祝贺。他祝贺保加利亚人民十五年来在建设社会主义的事业中取得的光辉灿烂的成就，并且指出：保加利亚人民争取在三、四年内提前完成第三个五年计划的努力，将对世界社会主义体系同世界资本主义体系的和平竞赛作出重大的贡献。
    薄一波副总理说，保加利亚人民在反对现代修正主义的斗争中，表现了高度的马克思列宁主义的原则精神和坚定不移的无产阶级立场，从而对巩固世界社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，作出了宝贵的贡献。薄一波副总理表示，中国政府和中国人民完全支持保加利亚政府旨在维护世界和平的各项建议。
    薄一波副总理说，同保加利亚人民一样，我们伟大的祖国在社会主义建设的道路上也取得了辉煌的成就。现在，全中国人民正在以新的劳动成绩来迎接伟大的中华人民共和国十周年国庆，为在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗。帝国主义和一切反动派疯狂地发出了各种各样的叫嚣，企图动摇中国人民加速建设社会主义的决心，破坏中华人民共和国的国际威信。但是，事实将再一次给他们以无情的打击。国内外反动派的一切无耻叫嚣都是枉费心机，必将遭到新的失败。
    全场以暴风雨般的热烈掌声欢迎潘切夫斯基大使在大会上讲话（全文见第三版）。大使在讲话中说，十五年来，保加利亚人民共和国已经从解放前的落后的农业国变成了拥有大规模合作化和机械化的农业的社会主义工业—农业国家了。
    大使说，三个星期以后，伟大的中国人民将以欢欣鼓舞的心情来热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立光辉的十周年。我们大家都是十年来伟大中国胜利前进的见证人，十年来，它已变为强大的社会主义国家——远东和全世界和平忠实的捍卫者。
    今天的大会是由对外文化联络委员会、中国保加利亚友好协会、中华全国总工会、全国青联、全国妇联、全国文联等单位联合举办的。对外文委副主任楚图南主持了今天的大会。出席大会的还有曾涌泉、刘长胜、夏衍、林海云、刘瑞龙、阳翰笙、刘清扬、张超、贾庭三等有关部门和人民团体的负责人。在北京的保加利亚专家、留学生和各国驻华使节与外交官员，应邀出席了大会。
