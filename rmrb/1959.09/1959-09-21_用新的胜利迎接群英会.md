Greet the National Heroes Conference with New Victories

    The National Heroes Conference—the conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in socialist construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade, which has attracted nationwide attention—has been decided to be held in Beijing on October 25th. This is a new and tremendous encouragement to the millions of heroic sons and daughters on the industrial, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts who are greeting the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with the brilliant achievements of the increased production and thrift movement. The rally for reviewing the strength of the working class and the oath-taking rally for advancing towards new goals is about to be held. Let us muster even greater efforts, dedicate new achievements to the great tenth anniversary of the National Day, and greet the great National Heroes Conference with new victories.
    Since the announcement in March this year of the decision by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council to convene a national conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in socialist construction in the fields of industry, transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade in Beijing in the fourth quarter, the vast number of workers immediately launched a vigorous labor competition with soaring enthusiasm. “Create new achievements and strive to go to Beijing” has become their common aspiration. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers has been even greater, and the great call to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule has been transformed into the actual actions of the vast number of workers. Since September, steel workers across the country have broken the highest daily output levels of steel and iron achieved in August more than twenty times in a row. According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, in the first half of September, the national average daily production level of steel increased by 23.7% compared with the same period in August, pig iron increased by 29.7%, and steel材 increased by 10%. The coal output of 140 key coal mines across the country in the first half of September also increased by 24.36% compared with the same period in August. The situation on other industrial fronts, as well as transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade fronts, is also good. This excellent leaping forward situation is the result of the hard work of the vast number of workers across the country under the shining light of the Party's General Line.
    In this upsurge of socialist construction, countless advanced producers have emerged from the ranks of millions of workers. Truly, the atmosphere is ever-changing, and heroes are emerging in large numbers. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the National Conference of Advanced Producers in 1956:
  “Advanced producers are the pioneers of the forward development of human economic life, and also the pioneers of the forward development of human social history.” The development of history is always like this: at the beginning, there are a few relatively advanced producers who adopt relatively advanced production technologies and create relatively advanced production quotas, and then more and more producers learn their technologies and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the whole society. In our Great Leap Forward, advanced producers are playing this pioneering role. Their advanced thinking, advanced experience, and advanced production levels inspire the vast number of workers, arming the vast number of workers ideologically and technologically, and opening up broad avenues for the improvement of social production levels.
    Every advanced producer must understand the important responsibility they shoulder in the development of history. On the one hand, they must continue to work hard and climb to higher production levels; on the other hand, they must enthusiastically help their companions catch up with their advanced levels. Only when all kinds of flowers are in full bloom can it be spring. Only when the vast number of workers catch up with the level of advanced producers can the social production level be comprehensively improved. Since the Great Leap Forward, this communist style of helping others catch up with oneself has been widely promoted. Wu Lianghu, an advanced riveter at the Wuhan Jiang'an Vehicle Factory, often imparts his production experience to others. With his help, two production groups have reached advanced levels. Zhao Mengtao, an advanced producer at the Xi'an Northwest State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill, has helped twelve female workers become advanced producers of the factory and workshop in the past six years. If the existing 2.24 million advanced producers and more than 130,000 advanced groups across the country all help the workers and groups around them reach advanced levels like Wu Lianghu, Zhao Mengtao, and many other advanced producers who are enthusiastic about helping others catch up with themselves, then how great a leap forward will the country's production have again!
    "Everyone can become Yao and Shun." The level of advanced producers is not unattainable. Since the Great Leap Forward, new advanced producers have emerged in large numbers, proving that as long as you muster your energy, strive for the top, and humbly learn from advanced experience, it is not difficult for anyone to strive for a place on the honor roll. For example, the Zhang Buhai Group of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company had a lot of waste products and long smelting times in the first quarter of this year, falling behind other groups. However, the workers in this group were not willing to lag behind. They mustered their energy, strove for the top, carefully analyzed the reasons for their backwardness, searched for ways to improve production in many ways, actively studied advanced technology, and learned advanced experience. Finally, they created advanced results in the second quarter and were rated as an advanced production group in Taiyuan City. Just as the waves of the Yangtze River push forward the waves behind, how many thousands of such deeds of catching up with the advanced from behind have occurred in the mass movement of the Great Leap Forward? Their path is the path of every producer.
    Every production leader bears the arduous organizational task of turning the level of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society. In the history of mankind, the process of turning the level of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society was once an extremely slow process. In feudal society, "teaching apprentices starves the master," and I don't know how many people who mastered advanced production technology carried their "unique skills" to their deaths; even if they were passed on, they would be kept secret, or "passed on to sons but not to daughters." In capitalist society, competition and monopoly have made all inventions and creations the patents of the bourgeoisie. Only socialist society can turn the level of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society at the fastest speed. However, this possibility provided by the social system still requires a great deal of organizational work to be realized. The mass movement of the Great Leap Forward is a revolutionary movement to turn the level of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society at a high speed. Every production leader must stand at the forefront of this mass revolutionary movement, advocate the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, enthusiastically support the advanced initiatives of the masses, and encourage and cherish every creation of the masses like protecting seedlings. Only in this way can the movement of advanced producers become an innovation movement participated in by millions of people. In large-scale mass movements, some temporary and partial shortcomings are inevitable when new things begin. Our task is to actively lead, overcome shortcomings, and lead the masses forward, rather than standing by and pointing fingers and pouring cold water on the masses. This is the correct attitude that proletarian revolutionaries should take. Because right-wing opportunists are afraid of mass movements, they always stand behind mass movements, pointing fingers and looking down on the inventions and creations of the broad masses. This proves that they are not proletarian revolutionaries. What is the essence of being afraid of mass movements? The essence is to not want mass movements. Not wanting mass movements is not wanting the masses. Not wanting the masses is not wanting revolution. Because revolutionary construction and revolutionary struggle, like revolutionary construction, are the personal undertakings of thousands upon thousands of people, and only by organizing them into broad mass movements can they be successful. If you are afraid of mass movements, how can you talk about proletarian revolution? Isn't it ridiculous!
    There is still more than a month to go before the opening of the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers in Socialist Construction in Industry, Transportation, Capital Construction, and Finance and Trade. This month and more is the most crucial month to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan. We hope that every advanced producer, every production leader, and the broad masses of workers will seize this crucial month and more to create even greater achievements. Beijing is enthusiastically preparing to receive your representatives! The Party and the people are eagerly awaiting your good news!

### 用新的胜利迎接群英会

    用新的胜利迎接群英会
    举国瞩目的群英会——全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面的社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议，已决定10月25日在北京召开。这对于正以增产节约运动的辉煌成就迎接建国十周年的千百万工业、交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线上的英雄儿女，是一个新的巨大的鼓舞。工人阶级力量的检阅大会、向新的目标前进的誓师大会就要召开了，让我们鼓足更大的干劲，用新的成就向伟大的国庆十周年献礼，用新的胜利迎接伟大的群英会。
    自从今年3月中共中央和国务院关于第四季度在北京召开全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者会议的决定公布以后，广大职工立即以冲天的干劲展开了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛。“创造新成绩，争取上北京”成为他们的共同心愿。党的八届八中全会以后，广大职工的干劲更足，热情更高，提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标的伟大号召，已经变为广大职工的实际行动。9月以来，全国钢铁职工连续二十多次突破了8月份所达到的钢和铁的最高日产量水平。据冶金工业部统计，9月上半月全国钢的平均日产水平比8月同期提高了23.7％，生铁提高了29.7％，钢材提高了10％。全国一百四十个重点煤矿9月上半月的煤炭产量也比8月同期提高了24.36％。其他各个工业战线以及交通运输、基本建设和财贸战线的形势都是良好的。这一大好的跃进形势，是全国广大职工在党的总路线的光辉照耀下辛勤劳动的果实。
    在这社会主义建设的高潮中，从千百万职工群众队伍中涌现出无数的先进生产者。真个是气象万千，英雄辈出。刘少奇同志在1956年全国先进生产者代表会议上说过：
  “先进生产者是人类经济生活向前发展的先驱，也是人类社会历史向前发展的先驱。”历史的发展总是这样，开始是少数比较先进的生产者，采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造了比较先进的生产定额，随后才有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平。在我们的大跃进中，先进生产者正是起着这种先驱作用。他们的先进思想、先进经验和先进的生产水平，鼓舞着广大的职工，把广大职工从思想上、生产技术上武装起来，为社会生产水平的提高开辟了广阔的道路。
    每一个先进生产者都必须了解自己在历史发展中肩负的重任，一方面要继续努力，攀上更高的生产水平；另一方面要满腔热情地帮助自己的同伴赶上自己的先进水平。万紫千红才是春，只有广大职工赶上先进生产者的水平，社会生产水平才能全面提高。大跃进以来，这种帮助别人赶上自己的共产主义风尚，已经得到普遍的发扬。武汉江岸车辆厂先进铆工吴良湖，经常把自己的生产经验传授给别人，在他的帮助下有两个生产小组达到了先进水平。西安西北国棉一厂先进生产者赵梦桃，六年来帮助十二个女工成为厂的、车间的先进生产者。全国现有的二百二十四万先进生产者和十三万多个先进小组，如果都像吴良湖、赵梦桃以及其他许多热心于帮助别人赶上自己的先进生产者那样，帮助自己周围的工人和小组达到先进水平，那么全国的生产将又会有多么巨大的跃进啊！
    “人皆可以为尧舜”，先进生产者的水平并不是高不可攀的。大跃进以来，新的先进生产者辈出，证明了只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，虚心学习先进经验，任何人都不难争取题名光荣榜。例如，太原钢铁公司第一炼钢厂张步海小组，今年第一季度废品多，冶炼时间长，落在别的小组后面，但是这个小组的工人不甘落后，他们鼓足干劲，力争上游，认真分析了落后的原因，多方寻找改进生产的办法，积极钻研先进技术，学习先进经验，终于在第二季度创造了先进成绩，被评为太原市的先进生产小组。长江后浪推前浪，这种落后赶上先进的事迹在大跃进的群众运动中何止万千？他们的道路是每一个生产者的道路。
    每一个生产的领导者，都担负着把先进生产者的水平变成全社会的生产水平的繁重的组织任务。在人类的历史上，先进生产者的水平变成全社会的生产水平，曾经是一个极其缓慢的过程。封建社会里，“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”，不知有多少掌握了先进生产技术的人怀揣着“绝技”与世长辞；即便有所传授，也要留一手，或者“传男不传女”。资本主义社会里，竞争、垄断，一切发明创造都成了资产阶级的专利品。只有社会主义社会，才能使先进生产者的水平以最快的速度变成全社会的生产水平。但是，社会制度所提供的这种可能性，也还需要去做巨大的组织工作，才能变成现实。大跃进的群众运动就是一个高速度地把先进生产者的水平变成全社会的生产水平的革命运动。每一个生产领导者都必须站在这个群众革命运动的前面，提倡敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，满腔热情地支持群众的先进创举，像保护幼芽一样地鼓励和爱护群众的每一项创造，这样才能使先进生产者的运动，成为千百万群众参加的革新运动。在大规模的群众运动中，在新生事物开始的时候，出现一些暂时性的局部的缺点是不可避免的。我们的任务是积极领导，克服缺点，率领群众前进，而不是站在旁边指指划划，给群众泼冷水。这是无产阶级革命家应当采取的正确态度。右倾机会主义分子因为害怕群众运动，所以他们总是站在群众运动的后面，指手划脚看不起广大群众的发明创造。这就证明了他们并不是无产阶级的革命家。害怕群众运动的实质是什么呢？实质就是不要群众运动，不要群众运动就是不要群众，不要革命。因为革命建设和革命斗争一样，是千千万万群众的切身事业，也只有组织成广大的群众运动才能得到成功。害怕群众运动，还侈谈什么无产阶级革命，岂不可笑吗！
    还有一个多月的时间，全国工业、交通运输、基本建设、财贸方面的社会主义建设先进集体和先进生产者代表会议就要开幕了。这一个多月，正是完成和超额完成今年国民经济计划的最关键的一个多月。我们希望每一个先进生产者、每一个生产领导者和广大职工群众都抓紧这关系重大的一个多月的时间，创造更伟大的成就。北京正热情准备接待你们的代表光临！党和人民正殷殷期待着你们的捷报！
