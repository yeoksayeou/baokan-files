To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
Dear Comrades!

The people of Malaya, together with the people of all other countries in the world, are welcoming the glorious and brilliant tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with incomparable excitement. The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party, on behalf of all party members and the people of Malaya, extends its warmest congratulations and highest respect to the great Chinese Communist Party and the hard-working and brave Chinese people who have led the Chinese people from victory to victory.

On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China solemnly declared its establishment. The long-term struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism finally achieved a decisive victory. Since then, one-quarter of humanity on the Asian continent has permanently broken free from the shackles of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, becoming masters of their own destiny. This is the most glorious and greatest achievement of the international communist movement after the great October Socialist Revolution, and a huge step forward for mankind on the road to liberation. The victory of the Chinese revolution has greatly changed the face of Asia, fundamentally changed the balance of international forces in favor of the socialist, peace, and democracy camp, and greatly encouraged and strongly supported the people of colonial and dependent countries who are striving for national liberation.

Over the past ten years, the People's Republic of China has steadfastly established relations of unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation with fraternal countries within the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, resolutely opposed the aggression and war policies of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, vigorously supported the national liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries, and consolidated and developed friendly relations with nationalist countries, thereby making outstanding contributions to the cause of socialism, peace, and democracy. Domestically, the Chinese people have made arduous efforts and heroic struggles, and have achieved a series of brilliant achievements on all fronts, including political, economic, ideological, cultural, and scientific, thereby enabling socialism to decisively defeat capitalism. In 958, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, China witnessed an unprecedented situation of the Great Leap Forward and the movement of People's Communes. Recently, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sounded the battle horn for continued leap forward. The 650 million Chinese people enthusiastically responded to this great call of the Party, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they are riding the wind and waves and advancing courageously. The people of Malaya firmly believe that with such a great people who can tame mountains and seas and dare to despise difficulties, China will surely catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years and leave it far behind; with such a heroic people full of revolutionary drive who can create miracles, building China into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture is no longer a distant future.

The victory of the Chinese revolution and the achievements of socialist construction were achieved under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and are the result of the creative combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of China by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, theoretical insights regarding China's new democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, added sharp weapons to the treasure house of Marxist-Leninist theory, and became the common wealth of the international proletariat and the oppressed people of the world. The people of Malaya have consistently worked hard to learn from, and will strengthen the learning of, the valuable experience of the Chinese revolution in order to develop the revolutionary struggle in Malaya more effectively.

For thirty years, the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya, under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party, have waged an indomitable and glorious struggle to overthrow British colonial rule and strive for national independence. In a situation where the people's armed struggle seriously hit the armed suppressors and the masses of the people universally launched a high tide of the independence movement, the Federation of Malaya finally gained independence on August 31, 1957, and Singapore, which was forcibly separated under the colonial policy of "divide and rule," also achieved internal autonomy on June 3 this year. However, since the forces of British colonialism still tightly control all aspects of Malaya's political, economic, military, and cultural affairs, the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya must continue to make arduous efforts to achieve complete national independence, peace, democracy, and the reunification of Singapore and Malaya.

The greatest obstacle currently facing the Malayan people in their struggle for complete national independence is the continuation of the anti-people war launched by the British imperialists. This war has lasted for eleven years and brought endless disasters to the people of all ethnic groups. The Malayan Communist Party has made unremitting efforts to restore domestic peace. Although the peace talks held in Baling in December 1955 failed to reach an agreement due to the sabotage by the British colonialists, the Malayan Communist Party has repeatedly proposed to the Federation of Malaya government to reopen peace talks in order to unite the forces of the whole nation to oppose imperialism. Regrettably, the Federation government has unreasonably rejected our party's proposal and continues to adhere to the British colonialists' policy of coercing our party to surrender. This is not only extremely wrong but also will never be realized. However, the restoration of peace is the people's irresistible desire and demand. The Malayan Communist Party now and in the future will spare no effort to continue to fight together with all patriotic political parties to realize this wish of the people, and is willing to hold talks with various political parties to jointly discuss a plan to abolish emergency ordinances and restore peace in our country. Our party has pointed out more than once that as long as the Federation government has the sincerity for peace, our party is willing to reopen negotiations with it at any time and reach an agreement under fair and reasonable conditions.

In recent years, the Federation of Malaya government and the former Singapore government have been using the notorious "Emergency Ordinance" and "Public Security Ordinance" to suppress democracy wantonly, especially to destroy the people's anti-imperialist patriotic movement in every possible way, so that the Malayan people's struggle for complete independence has encountered some temporary difficulties. However, the recent development of the struggle situation fully shows that no force can stop the people from continuing to move forward.

Malaya is a country with complex ethnic groups. The unity of all ethnic groups in good faith and their united anti-imperialism is the key to winning the victory of the national liberation struggle. Precisely because of this, the Malayan Communist Party, from the first day of its establishment, has been constantly calling on all people to unite under the banner of striving for national independence regardless of ethnicity. At the end of 1955, the Malayan Communist Party clearly listed "strengthening national unity" as one of the struggle programs. This program stated: "The people of various ethnic groups such as Malay, Chinese, and Indian, with the Malay ethnic group as the center, should unite, help each other, be equal, and respect each other's religious beliefs and customs. The government should pay attention to the development of the economy and culture of the Malay ethnic group. Malay should be the national language, and at the same time, the due status of other ethnic languages (including English) should be recognized. Each ethnic education should use the mother tongue as the medium, Malay should be a compulsory language in non-Malay schools, and English should be an elective language in non-English schools." This program correctly put forward the guidelines for solving the ethnic problems in Malaya, and pointed out the path to achieving true unity among all ethnic groups on an equal basis.

The Malayan Communist Party has always consistently educated all party members, the working class, and other working people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism and patriotism, and has led the vast masses of workers and peasants to unite in various organizations regardless of ethnicity in various periods, carrying out joint struggles, and achieving significant achievements, thereby creating good conditions for future national unity. It can be expected that in the favorable international situation where the East wind prevails and the West wind declines, the anti-imperialist patriotic united front of the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya based on the worker-peasant alliance will inevitably grow stronger, and will surely finally defeat the national oppressors—the British colonialists and their small handful of agents, and realize complete national independence, peace, democracy, and the reunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.

Dear Comrades! The people of Malaya and China have a long-standing historical connection and a deep traditional friendship. The common struggle of the two peoples against imperialism has made this friendship increasingly develop and consolidate. However, the Federation of Malaya government, under the instructions of British and American imperialists, has pursued a foreign policy of hostility towards socialist countries (especially towards People's China). Although the People's Republic of China has repeatedly treated it with a friendly attitude, the Federation government has willingly colluded with international reactionaries, viciously slandering China for "committing" so-called "atrocities" in Tibet, and expressing support for the request to the United Nations to discuss the so-called "Tibetan issue"; slandering China for carrying out subversive activities in Malaya; restricting and discriminating against our country's trade with China; forcing the Bank of China in the Federation of Malaya to stop operating, and so on. This series of actions hostile to China cannot represent the wishes of the Malayan people in the slightest. It not only damages the traditional friendship between our two peoples, but also puts Malaya in political isolation and prevents it from achieving normal development economically. The Malayan people cherish the friendship of the great Chinese people, a loyal friend of the oppressed people, and will make the greatest efforts to change this policy towards China that does not conform to the interests of the Malayan people, in order to further develop the traditional friendship between the people of Malaya and China.

Long live the traditional friendship between the people of Malaya and China!
Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the great Chinese people and their wise leader—Comrade Mao Zedong!
Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the victory of the liberation of oppressed nations all over the world!
Long live world peace!

### 马来亚共产党中央委员会的贺信

    马来亚共产党中央委员会的贺信致中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们！
    马来亚人民同全世界其他各国人民一起，怀着无比兴奋的心情，迎接光辉灿烂的中华人民共和国建国十周年。马来亚共产党中央委员会谨代表全体党员和马来亚人民，向领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利的伟大的中国共产党和勤劳勇敢的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
    1949年10月1日，中华人民共和国庄严地宣告成立。中国人民长期以来进行的反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争，终于获得了决定性的胜利。从此，四分之一的人类在亚洲土地上永远挣脱了半殖民地、半封建的枷锁，成为掌握自己命运的主人。这是继伟大的十月社会主义革命之后国际共产主义运动最光辉最伟大的成就，也是人类在解放的道路上的一个巨大跨步。中国革命的胜利，大大地改变了亚洲的面貌，使国际力量的对比起了有利于和平、民主、社会主义阵营的根本的变化，使正在争取民族解放的殖民地和附属国人民得到极大的鼓舞和有力的支援。
    十年来，中华人民共和国在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营内坚定不移地同各兄弟国家建立团结、互助、合作的关系，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略和战争政策，大力支持殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动，并巩固和发展同民族主义国家的友好关系，从而对社会主义、和平、民主事业作出了卓越的贡献。在国内，中国人民进行了艰苦的努力和英勇的斗争，在政治、经济、思想、文化和科学等各个战线上都取得了一系列辉煌的成就，从而使社会主义决定性地战胜了资本主义。1958年，在中国共产党提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，中国出现了史无前例的大跃进的形势和人民公社化运动。最近，中国共产党八届八中全会又响起了继续跃进的战斗号角。六亿五千万中国人民热烈响应党的这一伟大号召，在1958年的大跃进的基础上，乘风破浪，奋勇前进。马来亚人民深信：中国有了这样能够治山造海并且敢于藐视困难的伟大人民，再用不了十年就一定会在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国，并且把它远远地抛在后头；有了这样能够创造奇迹的充满革命干劲的英雄人民，把中国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，已经不是遥远的将来的事情。
    中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就，是在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下取得的，是中国共产党和毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国具体实践相结合的结果。中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的关于中国新民主主义革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论，给马克思列宁主义理论宝库增添了锐利的武器，成为国际无产阶级和全世界被压迫人民共同的财富。马来亚人民一贯努力学习，今后也将加强学习中国革命的宝贵经验，以便更有成效地发展马来亚的革命斗争。
    三十年来，马来亚各族人民，在马来亚共产党的领导下，为推翻英国殖民统治，争取民族独立而进行了不屈不挠的光荣的斗争。在人民武装斗争给予武装镇压者以严重打击和人民群众普遍掀起独立运动的高潮的形势下，马来亚联合邦终于在1957年8月31日获得了独立，在“分而治之”的殖民政策下被强制分割出去的新加坡也在今年6月3日取得了内部自治。然而，由于英国殖民主义者的势力依旧紧紧地控制着马来亚的政治、经济、军事、文化等各个方面，马来亚各族人民要实现完全民族独立、和平、民主和新、马重新统一，还必须继续作艰苦的努力。
    当前摆在马来亚人民争取完全民族独立的斗争道路上的最大障碍是英国帝国主义者所发动起来的反人民战争的继续。这个战争已持续了十一年之久，给各族人民带来了无穷的祸害。马来亚共产党为恢复国内和平曾经作了不懈的努力。尽管1955年12月在华玲举行的和平谈判、由于英国殖民主义者从中破坏而未能达成协议，但是，马来亚共产党为了团结全民力量一致反对帝国主义，曾经多次向马来亚联合邦政府提出了重开和谈的建议。很遗憾地，联合邦政府都无理地拒绝了我党的建议，并继续坚持英国殖民主义者的要挟我党投降的政策。这不但是极其错误而且也是永远无法实现的。然而，恢复和平是人民不可压抑的愿望和要求，马来亚共产党现在和将来都将不遗余力地同各爱国政党一道为实现人民的这个愿望而继续奋斗，并且愿意同各个政党举行会谈，共同商讨废除紧急法令和恢复我国和平的方案。我党不止一次指出，只要联合邦政府具有和平诚意，我党任何时候都愿意同它重开谈判，并且在公平合理的条件下达成协议。
    这几年来，马来亚联合邦政府和前新加坡政府一直援用臭名昭彰的“紧急法令”和“公共安全法令”，大肆压制民主，特别是对人民反帝爱国运动百般摧残，以致马来亚人民争取完全独立的斗争遭到某些暂时的困难。然而，最近斗争局势的发展充分地表明了任何力量也阻止不了人民的继续前进。
    马来亚是个民族复杂的国家，各民族精诚团结，一致反帝，是获得民族解放斗争胜利的关键。正因为这样，马来亚共产党从成立的第一天起，就不断号召全体人民不分民族地在争取民族独立的旗帜下团结起来。1955年底，马来亚共产党明确地把“加强民族团结”列为斗争纲领之一。这项纲领说：“以马来民族为中心的马、华、印等各民族人民应该团结、互助和平等，互相尊重彼此的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。政府应注意发展马来民族的经济和文化。以马来语为国语，同时，承认其他民族语言（包括英语）的应有地位，各民族教育以母语为媒介，马来语在非马来语学校作为必修语文，英语在非英语学校作为选修语文。”这项纲领正确地提出了解决马来亚民族问题的方针，并指出了各民族在平等的基础上达致真正团结的途径。
    马来亚共产党始终一贯地以无产阶级国际主义和爱国主义的精神来教育全体党员、工人阶级和其他劳动人民，并在各个时期领导了广大的工农群众不分民族地团结在各种组织内，进行共同的斗争，取得了重大的成就，从而为今后的民族团结创造了良好的条件。可以预期，在东风日盛、西风日衰的有利的国际形势下，马来亚各族人民以工农联盟为基础的反帝爱国统一战线必然会壮大起来，并且一定会最后战胜民族压迫者——英国殖民主义者和它的一小撮代理人，实现完全民族独立、和平、民主和新加坡、马来亚联合邦的重新统一。
    亲爱的同志们！马、中两国人民有着历史悠久的联系和深厚的传统友谊。两国人民反对帝国主义的共同斗争使得这个友谊日益发展和巩固。然而，马来亚联合邦政府在英、美帝国主义者的指使下，奉行了敌视社会主义国家（特别是敌视人民中国）的外交政策。尽管中华人民共和国政府频频以友好态度相待，但是，联合邦政府却自甘与国际反动派同流合污，恶毒地诽谤中国在西藏“犯下了”所谓“暴行”，并且表示支持要求联合国讨论所谓“西藏问题”；诬蔑中国正在马来亚进行颠覆活动；限制和歧视我国同中国的贸易；迫使在马来亚联合邦的中国银行停止营业，等等。这一系列敌视中国的行径，丝毫不能代表马来亚人民的愿望。它不仅损害了我们两国人民的传统友谊，而且使马来亚在政治上陷于孤立和在经济上得不到正常的发展。马来亚人民非常珍视被压迫人民的忠实朋友——伟大的中国人民的友谊，并且将以最大的努力来改变这种不符合马来亚人民利益的对华政策，以便进一步发展马、中两国人民的传统友谊。
    马、中两国人民的传统友谊万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民及其英明的领袖——毛泽东同志万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    全世界被压迫民族解放胜利万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
