Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th -- Zhang Weilie, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, held a banquet tonight for the Chinese government delegation led by Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, who came here to visit the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the Soviet Union.

Zasyadko, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, attended the banquet and spoke. He said that the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is coming in a few days, which is a day of great historical significance in the lives of the Chinese people. In the past year, the Chinese people have realized the Great Leap Forward. Now China has changed from a backward agricultural country to a powerful socialist country. In terms of the quality of many important industrial products, China has entered the ranks of the most developed countries. The friendship and mutual relations between the Soviet Union and China, like the relations between all socialist countries, are based on Marxism-Leninism.

Zasyadko pointed out that the unity and cooperation of socialist countries and the friendship between the Soviet Union and China are the foundation for consolidating world peace. Mutual visits and exchanges of construction experience between people of the two countries will further promote the development of friendship.

Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun said that we have spent a pleasant and meaningful and unforgettable ten days here. Although the time for visiting is short, we have seen and learned a lot. The Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the Soviet Union is a summary of the achievements of the Soviet people in socialist construction for more than 40 years under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the government. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union in science and technology and the development of the national economy is very valuable to us. Learning from the Soviet Union is our firm policy, and we especially cherish the great friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. The great achievements of our country's socialist construction are inseparable from learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people to our country. The Chinese people sincerely thank the Soviet big brother for its assistance. Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun said that not long ago, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held and passed a resolution on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy. The people of the whole country have warmly responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session and are carrying out a large-scale and vigorous mass movement to ensure the completion of the 1959 national economic plan and to complete, over fulfill, and approach the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in 1959.

Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun then said that the fact that our country's national economy had a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 and continued to leap forward in 1959 fully proves the correctness of the general line of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong on going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It proves the necessity and correctness of establishing and developing people's communes. Any slander by imperialists and reactionaries against our country's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the people's commune movement will surely be powerfully countered in the face of the continued leap forward of our people, and victory belongs to the Chinese people. Chargé d'Affaires Zhang Weilie also spoke at the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were Maksarev, Chairman of the State Science and Technology Committee of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the General Affairs Committee of the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, Strokin, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union, Ginzburg, Vice Chairman of the State Construction Commission, and Pushkin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, and others.

All members of the Chinese government delegation also attended the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th -- Xi Zhongxun, head of the Chinese government delegation visiting the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the Soviet Union and Vice Premier of the State Council, and some members of the delegation, left Moscow by "Tu-104" plane tonight to return to China. Other members of the delegation will continue their visits in the Soviet Union.

This afternoon, Zasyadko received the Chinese government delegation at the Kremlin. During the meeting, the two sides had a cordial and friendly conversation.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- The government delegation led by Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, which went to the Soviet Union to visit the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, and some members of the government delegation which went to the Czechoslovak Republic to participate in the opening ceremony of the Brno International Fair, returned to Beijing by "Tu-104" passenger plane this afternoon after completing their visits to the two places.

    扎夏迪科在我驻苏使馆招待会上说
    中国人民实现了大跃进
    习仲勋副总理率政府代表团部分团员回到北京
    据新华社莫斯科10日电　中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办张伟烈今晚为前来这里参观苏联国民经济成就展览会的、由国务院副总理习仲勋率领的中国政府代表团举行了宴会。
    苏联部长会议副主席扎夏迪科出席了宴会，并且讲了话。他说，几天之后就是中华人民共和国成立十周年纪念日，这是中国人民生活中具有伟大历史意义的日子。近一年来中国人民实现了大跃进，现在中国已从过去落后的农业国变成为强大的社会主义国家，按许多重要工业产品的质量来说，中国已走入最发达国家的行列。苏中两国的友谊和相互关系同所有社会主义国家之间的关系一样，是建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的。
    扎夏迪科指出，社会主义各国的团结合作和苏中友谊是巩固世界和平的基础。两国人士间的互相访问参观，交流建设经验将进一步促进友谊的发展。
    习仲勋副总理讲话说，我们在这里愉快地度过了有意义的、令人难忘的十几天。参观和访问的时间虽然很短，但看到和学到的东西很多。苏联国民经济成就展览会是苏联人民在苏联共产党和政府领导下四十多年来进行社会主义建设成就的总结。苏联的科学技术和发展国民经济的先进经验，对我们是非常宝贵的。学习苏联是我国坚定不移的方针，我们尤其珍视的是苏联人民对中国人民的伟大友谊。我国社会主义建设的巨大成就是同学习苏联的先进经验和苏联人民对我国兄弟般的援助分不开的。中国人民衷心地感谢苏联老大哥的援助。习仲勋副总理说，不久前，中国共产党召开了八届八中全会，通过了开展增产节约运动的决议。全国人民热烈响应了八中全会的号召，正在开展着规模巨大的、轰轰烈烈的群众运动，以保证完成1959年的国民经济计划，并在1959年内提前三年超额完成、完成和接近完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。
    习仲勋副总理接着说，1958年我国国民经济全面大跃进和1959年继续跃进的事实，充分证明了中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的正确。证明了建立和发展人民公社的必要和正确。帝国主义者和反动派对我国工农业大跃进和人民公社运动的任何污蔑，在我国人民继续跃进的面前，一定会遭到有力的回击，胜利是属于中国人民的。张伟烈代办也在宴会上讲了话。
    出席宴会的还有苏联国家科学技术委员会主席、苏联国民经济成就展览会总务委员会主席马克萨烈夫，苏联国家计划委员会副主席斯特罗金，国家建设委员会副主席金兹布尔格和苏联外交部副部长普希金等。
    中国政府代表团全体团员也出席了宴会。
    据新华社莫斯科10日电　参观苏联国民经济成就展览会的中国政府代表团团长、国务院副总理习仲勋和代表团部分团员，今晚乘“图—一○四”飞机离开莫斯科返国。代表团其他团员将在苏联继续参观访问。
    今天下午扎夏迪科在克里姆林宫接见了中国政府代表团。接见时，双方进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    据新华社11日讯　由国务院副总理习仲勋率领的前往苏联参观苏联国民经济成就展览会的政府代表团，和前往捷克斯洛伐克共和国参加布尔诺国际博览会开幕典礼的政府代表团部分团员，在结束两地的参观后，今天下午乘“图—一○四”客机，由莫斯科回到北京。
