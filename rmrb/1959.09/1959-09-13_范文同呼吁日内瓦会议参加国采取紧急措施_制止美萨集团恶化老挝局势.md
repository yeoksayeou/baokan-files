Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th - According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, sent a telegram on the 6th to the governments of the People's Republic of China, Cambodia, and France, which participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina, requesting them to pay attention to the situation in Laos, because the situation there is becoming extremely serious due to the increasingly brazen sabotage of the Geneva Agreements on Laos by the US imperialists and the Sannikone government. In the telegram, Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong said that this situation directly threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and seriously threatens the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.
    Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong requested the countries concerned to take urgent measures in their capacity and responsibility as participants in the Geneva Conference to ensure the correct and full implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and to promote the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos, in order to stop the intervention of US imperialism and maintain peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th - TASS, New York, 10th - According to a report from Vientiane by a "Wall Street Journal" reporter, the Lao government is frantically requesting external military assistance. He said, "This shows that the Lao government does not fully trust its own army and is afraid of being overthrown by the army."
    The reporter also reported that the Royal Lao Government "yesterday rejected the Pathet Lao's proposal for negotiations," although the Pathet Lao expressed its willingness to resolve Laos' political problems through peaceful means, "if the Royal Lao Government is sincerely willing to resolve them in this way."
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th - New York News: According to an announcement from the United Nations Headquarters on the 11th, the so-called special committee "investigating" the situation in Laos, illegally established by the Security Council under the manipulation of the United States, will depart on the evening of the 12th and arrive in Vientiane, the capital of the Kingdom of Laos, on the 15th.
    According to Bourguiba, the representative of Tunisia, a member of the subcommittee, Japanese representative Shinichi Shibusawa has been appointed as chairman of the subcommittee, and Italian representative Baratieri and Argentine representative Ahrens have been appointed as joint drafters of the "report." American Blinkensdorf has been appointed as secretary-general of the subcommittee. Blinkensdorf had previously served as secretary of the United Nations "inspection team" in Lebanon.
