Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 24th. Building on the foundation of successfully trial-producing eight major optical precision instruments last year, the Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has continued to trial-produce more than ten kinds of complex precision optical instruments this year, completing its annual research task ahead of schedule as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

These optical instruments, after evaluation, have proven to meet the standards of similar products internationally, and in some aspects reflect independent design characteristics based on China's conditions.

The large electron microscope, automatic recording infrared spectrometer, new universal tool microscope, full phase microscope, large interferometer, and 0.2-second accuracy optical theodolite, independently designed and manufactured by the institute this year, are all important instruments with wide applications in national industrial construction, scientific research, and cultural and educational undertakings. The large electron microscope, independently designed and jointly trial-produced with the Institute of Electronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanghai Precision Medical Instrument Factory, will be applied in scientific fields such as biology, chemistry, metallurgy, medicine, and physics to observe metal structures, polymer structures, and biological cell structures. The automatic recording infrared spectrometer, successfully trial-produced for the first time in China, has wide applications in the organic chemical industry and can be used for qualitative, quantitative analysis, and purity inspection; in scientific research, it is an important tool for studying molecular structures.

This institute has also achieved significant results in the manufacture of measuring instruments this year. The aerial camera produced has been evaluated on-site in the sky by the National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, proving its quality is very good and it can take clear aerial photographs. The 0.2-second optical theodolite meets the specifications of the national second-class triangulation geodetic instrument. In terms of photographic lenses, a series of fifteen types including television camera lenses, panoramic movie projection lenses, and step-type zoom lenses have been produced.

Currently, researchers across the institute are summarizing their achievements in optical system design, spectral instruments, electron optical instruments, precision measuring instruments, surveying instruments, microscopes, and other fields over the past year, and are writing papers and reports.

    科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所完成全年任务
    制成十多种精密的光学仪器
    据新华社长春24日电　中国科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所在去年试制出八大件光学精密仪器的基础上，今年又继续试制出十多种复杂精密的光学仪器，提前完成了全年研究任务，向建国十周年献礼。
    这些光学仪器经过鉴定，证明质量达到了国际上同类产品的标准，并且在某些方面体现了根据我国条件进行独立设计的特点。
    这个研究所今年独立设计和制造的大型电子显微镜、自动记录红外光谱仪、新型万能工具显微镜、全位相显微镜、大型干涉仪和零点二秒精度光学经纬仪等，都是在国家工业建设、科学研究、文化教育事业中用途广泛的重要仪器。今年独立设计并与科学院电子学研究所、上海精密医疗机械厂合作试制的大型电子显微镜，将应用到生物、化学、冶金、医学、物理等科学领域中，用来观察金属结构、高分子结构和生物细胞结构。我国第一次试制成功的自动记录红外光谱仪，在有机化学工业上有广泛用途，可以做定性、定量分析和纯度检查；在科学研究上，是研究分子结构的重要工具。
    这个研究所今年在测量仪器的制造方面也取得了重大成果。制成的航空摄影机，经过国家测绘总局的上天现场鉴定，证明质量很好，能拍摄出清晰的航空照片。零点二秒光学经纬仪，达到了国家二等三角大地测量仪的规范要求。在照像物镜方面，制出了一系列电视摄影物镜、全景电影放映物镜和阶段式变焦距摄影物镜等十五种。
    现在全所研究人员正在总结一年多来在光学系统设计、光谱仪器、电子光学仪器、精密计量仪器、测量仪器、显微镜等方面的成就，编写论文报告。
