    Dusk on the Danube
    Wen Jie
    Dusk, I sit by the window,
    Reading Vaptsarov's selected poems,
    Those fiery verses congealed with blood,
    Battle oaths forged with life.
    My hands suddenly tremble slightly,
    A wisp of solemn thought lingers in my heart,
    So, I rise, leaning on the windowsill,
    And gaze down at the riverside park opposite.

    At this moment, the evening breeze blows towards me,
    The afterglow of the setting sun burns in the sky,
    The linden tree sways its lush green branches,
    Caressing the shimmering fountain.
    The old man fishing leans against the railing,
    Smiling and pointing to the ripples the fish stir on the water,
    As the copper bell on the fishing rod rings,
    A fresh fish leaps onto the rocky shore.

    Young lovers stroll arm in arm,
    Around the granite flower beds,
    Then along the winding forest path,
    Pouring out mutual love and longing.
    Mothers sit on long benches,
    Peacefully knitting scarves and embroidering curtains,
    Or gently humming tender songs,
    To lull the babies in their prams to sleep.

    Over there, a group of children on the lawn,
    Leaping like fledglings learning to fly,
    They play with the flowing spring water for a while,
    And then cheer for the returning ships…
    Ah, dusk on the Danube!
    How joyful, beautiful, and splendid,
    Who, seeing such a heart-stirring scene,
    Could fail to burst forth with a poet's inspiration?

    You, Vaptsarov!
    Drenched in blood, standing firm before the enemy's guns,
    The People's Republic you called out to on your deathbed,
    Isn't it this happy today?
    If you were alive today,
    I think you would no longer shout in anger,
    You would sing of peace, labor, and love,
    And write so many new lyrical poems?

	1959, 8, 8, Written in Vidin on the Danube

    多瑙河畔的黄昏
    闻捷
    黄昏，我坐在窗前，
    朗读着瓦普察洛夫的诗选，
    那鲜血凝成的火热诗句，
    生命铸成的战斗誓言。
    我双手忽然微微颤动，
    一缕严肃的情思萦回我心间，
    于是，我按着窗台站起
    俯视对面的河滨公园。
    这时，晚风迎面吹来，
    落日的余辉燃烧在天边，
    菩提树摆动它浓绿的枝叶，
    抚摸那闪光的喷泉。
    垂钓的老人倚着栏杆，
    笑指波光上鱼儿激起的水圈，
    随着钓杆上的铜铃一响
    一条鲜鱼便跃上岩岸。
    年轻的情侣挽着手臂，
    绕过花岗石砌成的花坛，
    然后沿着弯曲的林间小路，
    倾吐相互的爱慕和思恋。
    母亲们坐在长靠椅上，
    安详地织着围巾、绣着窗帘，
    或是轻轻哼起温柔的歌子，
    为婴儿车里的宝贝催眠。
    那边草坪上有群孩子，
    跳跃着有如学飞的乳燕，
    他们一会嬉弄那长流的泉水，
    一会又欢呼归来的轮船……
    多瑙河畔的黄昏啊！
    多么欢乐、绮丽又灿烂，
    谁看见这样动人心弦的景色，
    能不涌出诗人的灵感？
    你啊，瓦普察洛夫！
    淋着血，屹立在敌人枪口前，
    你临终呼唤的人民共和国，
    不就是这幸福的今天？
    你假如生活到现在，
    我想你不会再愤怒地呐喊，
    你会讴歌和平、劳动和爱情，
    写下多少新的抒情诗篇？	1959，8，8，写于多瑙河畔之维定
