Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 17th: Soviet Premier Khrushchev answered questions from American reporters at the National Press Club in Washington on September 16, 1959, after delivering a speech.

	The first question concerned the personality cult of Stalin, a blatantly provocative question. In response, Khrushchev said: I want to ask the person who raised this question: When did they fabricate this question, when did they raise it, what purpose are they pursuing, what task are they setting for themselves, what do they want to achieve? You obviously want to put me in an awkward position; you are laughing in advance. However, as the Russians say: He who laughs last laughs best. I fear that you will regret being so gleeful in advance for your supposedly clever tricks in fabricating all sorts of ridiculous lies.

	I will not pay attention to this provocation. Nor am I willing to make unfriendly rebuttals in front of the many good American journalists gathered here. I only want to add: No matter how fast a lie runs, it can never catch up with the truth. (Applause)

	In response to the question of whether the Soviet Union's launch of a rocket to the moon on the eve of his visit to the United States was merely a coincidence, and whether the Soviet Union's sending of a symbol to the moon indicated an intention to claim it, Khrushchev said that the coincidence of my visit to the United States and the Soviet Union's launch of a lunar rocket is a normal thing, but I think it's a pleasant coincidence (laughter in the hall). If any of you doubt this coincidence, then try it: you tell the scientists to make the launch of a lunar rocket coincide with a certain date, and see what happens (laughter, applause). In answering the second part of the question, he said that those who ask such questions are thinking in terms of the concepts of capitalist private ownership, while I am a person of the socialist system, with a new worldview and new concepts. The concept of "mine" is outdated in our country, and the new concept of "ours" has been adopted. Therefore, we regard the launching of cosmic rockets and the sending of our symbols to the moon as a victory for all of us. We understand the word "ours" to mean all countries of the world, that is, we understand it to mean that this is also your achievement and the achievement of all people living on Earth (applause).

	In response to a question about expanding bilateral trade between the United States and the Soviet Union, especially in consumer goods, and what the Soviet Union needs most, Khrushchev said: What we need most is to eliminate trade discrimination. This is the most important thing. Everything you manufacture, we can also manufacture, and some things we manufacture even earlier. We are not asking you for anything. You produce more of certain goods today than we do, but this situation is caused by historical reasons. He said, I think the day is not far off! In this movement, our position will change; the day is not far off when we will catch up with you in economic development, and even surpass you. I didn't come to the United States with a long arm to reach into your banks. This is yours. Our own is enough (laughter). I will not go begging with a hat, asking everyone to throw into my hat the small change they think they can throw in (lively). As for developing trade between our two countries, we treat this matter this way: we buy what we need, and you will sell what you think you can sell.

	In response to the provocative question about so-called "Russian interference in Hungarian affairs," Khrushchev said, Look, the so-called Hungarian question is like a dead mouse stuck between some people's teeth. It's uncomfortable for them, but they can't spit it out (laughter in the hall). If you want to lead our conversation in this direction, then I can throw you more than just one dead cat. These dead cats will be fresher than the Hungarian incident everyone knows about.

	As for the Hungarian question, I have already spoken about it in considerable detail many times. When I, on behalf of our heroic Soviet Union, went to Hungary as a guest, I answered the Hungarian people with particular satisfaction and pleasure. This was not long after the Hungarian incident. At that time, the entire Hungarian people applauded and welcomed us, and I simply didn't know how to describe the Hungarian people's true attitude towards the Soviet Union more vividly and appropriately. All the problems between us and Hungary have long been resolved, and we are moving forward side by side victoriously. They are building socialism, and we are building communism. Our goals are the same—one road, one purpose.

	Someone asked Khrushchev, "When does the Soviet Union 'want to throw people' onto the moon?"

	He answered, You used a very inappropriate word: "throw people." We don't plan to throw people, because we highly cherish people, and we won't throw anyone away. We will only send people into space when we have created the necessary technical conditions. These conditions are not yet mature.

	A reporter asked Khrushchev: What is the purpose of your visit to Beijing after visiting the United States?

	He replied: October 1st is the tenth anniversary of the seizure of power by the Chinese working class and the Chinese laboring peasantry. It will be ten years since the establishment of the people's government in China. The Chinese people solemnly celebrate this day, and we also celebrate this day with our friends. For example, we believe that perhaps at some point in the future, the era will be counted from the day of the October Revolution. But that is in the future. The Chinese also cherish their victories, and we respect their love for their achievements. On the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I led a Soviet delegation to Beijing to participate in the celebrations. Now we have received an invitation from the Chinese government to send a delegation to participate in the tenth anniversary celebrations.

	My time is arranged as follows: I will return to the Soviet Union on September 28th, and fly to Beijing the next day. Of course, this is more burdensome for me, but I think it is a great honor to be able to go to our Chinese friends. The Soviet delegation will depart for the People's Republic of China before I return to Moscow. In my absence, the Soviet delegation will be led by Comrade Suslov.

	Someone asked Khrushchev if his talk today contained any new proposals to ease international tensions?

	Khrushchev replied that the first thing that needs to be done is to solve the problems that have already been raised and remain to be solved. To come up with new problems while old problems have not yet been solved is tantamount to evading the solution of the main problems. If someone says to me that I have not raised any new problems in my talk, then I agree with this statement. Here, it might be helpful to think of a Russian proverb: Reviewing the old makes it possible to understand the new. We must strive tenaciously to eliminate the obstacles that hinder the approach of the people of all countries, and extinguish the small sparks that may ignite the flames of war. These sparks must be extinguished, and solutions to outstanding issues must be sought to guarantee peace for the people of all countries.

	A reporter said: In the United States, there is great interest in the status of various nationalities in the Soviet Union, including Jewish residents. This reporter asked Khrushchev to say a few words on this issue.

	Khrushchev said that there is no national problem in the Soviet Union as you understand it. All nationalities live in harmony and have equal rights. The various nationalities in our country trust each other and march side by side towards a common goal—communism. The following can also illustrate the status of Jewish residents there. Among those who created the conditions and successfully launched the lunar rocket, Jews also occupy their due place.

	Someone asked Khrushchev: You seemed to say at a diplomatic reception that you were going to bury us underground. Please explain what you meant.

	Khrushchev replied: I did say that, but someone deliberately distorted my words. This does not mean burying someone physically at some point, but rather the change of social systems in the historical development of society. He said that capitalism is now opposing communism. I believe that communism—a social system that creates good conditions for developing the country's productive forces, makes it possible for everyone to give full play to their talents, and guarantees full freedom for society and every individual in society—is bound to win. You may disagree with my opinion. And I disagree with your opinion. So what do we do? We must coexist. You live under the capitalist system, and we are going to build communism. New and progressive things will inevitably triumph; old and outdated things will surely die. The short history of our Soviet state since its founding is detrimental to capitalism. What was the economic position of pre-revolutionary Russia? Russia was a backward and largely illiterate country. And now we have a strong economy, and we have highly developed science and culture. Some of you say that if the Soviet Union has more scientists in the future, then we are doomed. We are heading towards this "doom," and we are creating conditions to have more scientists, to make everyone educated, otherwise, communism cannot be built. Because communism is science.

	At the end of Khrushchev's question-and-answer session, there was a stormy and prolonged applause.

    赫鲁晓夫在华盛顿答记者问
    苏联努力消除阻挠各国人民接近的障碍
    捏造谎言提出挑衅问题的人将弄巧成拙
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿17日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫1959年9月16日在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部发表演说后回答了美国记者的问题。
    第一个问题是有关对斯大林的个人迷信这个带有露骨的挑衅性质的问题。赫鲁晓夫在回答这个问题时说：我想问问提出这个问题的人：什么时候他们编造出这个问题，什么时候他们提出这个问题来的，他们追求的是什么目的，他们给自己提出的是什么任务，他们想要得到什么？你们显然想使我处于窘境，你们事先就笑了。可是，俄国人说得好：最后笑的人才是笑得好的人。你们这些捏造种种荒唐谎言的人为你们自以为聪明的花样而事先高兴，我怕你们会因此而后悔。
    我不理睬这种挑衅。也不愿意在聚集在这里的许多好的美国新闻界人士面前，作不友好的反击。我只想补充一句：谎言跑得再快，也永远追赶不上真理。（掌声）
    赫鲁晓夫在回答在他访问美国前夕苏联向月球发射火箭是否只是巧合，以及苏联把标志送到月球上，是否表明打算提出占领月球的要求这个问题时说，我到美国访问和苏联发射月球火箭的巧合——这是平常的事，不过，我认为这是愉快的巧合（场内笑声）。如果你们中间有人怀疑这种巧合，那么请试试看：你们告诉科学家，让他们把发射月球火箭符合某一个日期，看看这会发生什么事情（场内笑声、掌声）。他回答问题的第二部分说，那些这样提问题的人是用资本主义私有制心理的概念进行思考的，而我则是社会主义制度的人，我有着新的世界观和新的概念。“我的”这个概念在我们那里已经过时，而采取了“我们的”这个新概念。因此，我们把发射宇宙火箭和把我们的标志送往月球，看作是我们大家的胜利。我们把“我们的”这几个字理解为世界各国，也就是说，我们的理解是，这也是你们的成就和生活在地球上的所有的人的成就（掌声）。
    在回答有关扩大美苏双边贸易，特别是在消费品方面，苏联最需要的是什么这个问题时，赫鲁晓夫说：我们最需要的是消除贸易歧视。这是最主要的。你们所制造的一切，我们也能制造，而某些东西我们制造出来的更早。我们什么也不向你们请求。某些商品你们今天比我们生产得多，但是，这种情况是历史原因造成的。他说，我认为，这样的日子已经不远了！在这一运动中，我们的地位将发生变化；我们在经济发展中将赶上你们，而且赶过你们的日子也不远了。我不是带着一只长手臂到美国来想把手伸进你们的银行去的。这是你们的。我们自己的就已经够了（笑声）。我不会拿着帽子去乞讨，要每个人在我的帽子里扔下他们认为能够扔下的小钱（活跃）。至于说到我们两国之间发展贸易，我们是这样对待这件事情的：我们购买我们所需要的，而你们将出售你们认为可以出售的东西。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答所谓“俄国干涉匈牙利事务”这个挑衅性的问题时说，瞧，所谓匈牙利问题就像一只死老鼠一样地塞在某些人的牙齿中间，这对他们是不舒服的，可是又吐不出来（场内笑声）。如果你们想把我们的谈话引到这个方向去，那末我可以扔给你们的死猫不止一只。这些死猫会比大家知道的匈牙利事件问题更加新鲜。
    至于匈牙利问题，我已经多次相当详细地谈到过了。当我代表我们英勇的苏联到匈牙利去做客的时候，我曾经怀着特别满意和愉快的心情向匈牙利人民作了回答。这是在匈牙利事件后没有多久的事情。当时整个匈牙利都对我们鼓掌欢迎，我简直不知道用什么办法来更生动更恰当地形容匈牙利人对苏联的真正态度。我们同匈牙利之间所有的问题早就解决了，我们正在无往不胜地并肩向前迈进。他们在建设社会主义，而我们在建设共产主义。我们的目标是一致的——一条道路，一个目的。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫苏联“想在什么时候把人扔到月球上去？”
    他对这个问题回答说，您使用了一个十分不恰当的字眼：“扔人”。我们不打算扔人，因为我们高度地珍视人，我们不会扔任何人。当我们创造了必要的技术条件的时候，我们才把人送到宇宙中去。这些条件现在尚未成熟。
    有记者问赫鲁晓夫：您在访问美国之后到北京去有何目的？
    他回答说：10月1日是中国工人阶级和中国劳动农民取得政权十周年。中国建立人民政权要满十年了。中国人民隆重地庆祝这一天，我们也庆祝我们朋友的这个日子。举例说，我们认为，可能在将来某个时候，纪元会从十月革命那一天算起。但这是将来的事。中国人也珍视自己的胜利，而我们尊重他们对自己的成就的热爱。在中华人民共和国成立五周年的时候，我曾经率领一个苏联代表团到北京去参加庆典。现在我们接到了中国政府的邀请，要我们派一个代表团去参加十周年庆典。
    我的时间是这样安排的：9月28日我要回到苏联，次日飞往北京。当然，这对我来说是比较繁重的，但是我认为，能到我们中国朋友那里去，这是很大的荣幸。苏联代表团在我回到莫斯科以前就要启程去中华人民共和国。在我不在的时候，苏联代表团将由苏斯洛夫同志率领。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫他在今天的谈话中是否包含着什么缓和国际紧张局势的新建议？
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，首先需要解决已经提出而有待解决的问题。而在老问题还没有解决的时候，又想出一些新问题，就等于逃避主要问题的解决。如果有人对我说，我在谈话中没有提出新的问题，那我同意这种说法。这里不妨想一想俄国的一句谚语：温故而知新。我们要顽强地努力来消除阻挠各国人民接近的障碍，扑灭可能燃起战火的小火星。必须扑灭这种火星，必须谋求解决悬而未决的问题，以保障各国人民的和平。
    有记者说：在美国，对苏联各民族，其中包括犹太居民的地位很感兴趣。这个记者要求赫鲁晓夫就这个问题说几句话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在苏联并不存在像你们所理解的那样的民族问题。所有民族都是友好相处的，权利平等的。我国各民族彼此信任，并排地走向共同目的——共产主义，下面这件事也可以说明我们那里的犹太居民的地位。在那些创造条件、成功地发射月球火箭的人当中，犹太人也占有应有的地位。
    有人问赫鲁晓夫说：您似乎在一次外交招待会上说，你们要把我们埋葬到地下。请解释一下您的意思是什么。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说：我的确说过这个，但是有人故意歪曲了我的讲话。这并不是说在什么时候把什么人从肉体上埋葬，而是说在社会的历史发展中社会制度的改变。他说，资本主义现在正在反对共产主义。我相信，共产主义——为发展国家生产力创造良好条件、使得每个人都有可能发挥自己的才能、保证社会和社会的每个人的充分自由的社会制度一定要胜利。你们可以不同意我的看法。而我也不同意你们的看法。那么，我们怎么办呢？必须共处。你们在资本主义制度下生活，而我们要建成共产主义。新的、进步的事物必然胜利；旧的、过时的事物一定死亡。我们苏维埃国家建国以来短短的历史是对资本主义不利的。革命前的俄国在经济发展方面处在什么地位呢？俄国是一个落后的、文盲很多的国家。而现在我们有了强大的经济，我们有了高度发达的科学和文化。你们当中有些人说，如果苏联将来有更多的科学家，那我们就要完蛋了。我们正在走向这种“完蛋”，我们正在创造条件，使我们有更多的科学家，使所有的人都成为有教养的人，否则，就无法建成共产主义。因为共产主义——这是科学。
    赫鲁晓夫在结束他的答问时，响起了暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。
