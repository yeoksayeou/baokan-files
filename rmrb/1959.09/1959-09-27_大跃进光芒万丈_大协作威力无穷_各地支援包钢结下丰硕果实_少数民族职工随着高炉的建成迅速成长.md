    The Great Leap Forward Shines Radiantly, Great Collaboration is Infinitely Powerful
    All Regions Support Baotou Steel, Bearing Fruitful Results
    Minority Workers Grow Rapidly with the Completion of the Blast Furnace
    (Our Newspaper, Baotou, 26th Dispatch) The construction of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace received strong support from people across the country. Hundreds of factories and enterprises in more than twenty provinces and cities nationwide rushed to manufacture various mechanical equipment and supply construction materials for Baotou Steel, providing support in technical strength, making a huge contribution to ensuring the successful iron tapping of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace.
    The Baotou Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace and related coking, water source, and mining projects are large in scale, requiring a total of 26,000 tons of equipment. Among them, except for about 10% of important equipment supplied by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the rest were manufactured domestically. The steel, cement, and timber alone that were supplied by various regions to support Baotou Steel amounted to more than 8,000 train carriages. The equipment and materials needed by Baotou Steel came from all over the country. The materials used here included: Anshan Steel's steel, Shenyang's cables, Shanghai's electric mouth pipes, Xi'an's bearings, Guangzhou's rosin, Lanzhou's petroleum and asphalt, Hunan's nanmu bamboo, and timber from the Greater Khingan Mountains. The furnace top equipment, coke oven, and hot blast stove equipment installed here were all manufactured by factories in Shenyang, Harbin, Dalian, Shanghai, Changsha, Xiangtan, Guizhou and other places.
    In accordance with the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," factories in various regions gave priority guarantees to the mechanical equipment and materials needed by Baotou Steel when arranging production tasks. Shenyang Valve Factory received the manufacturing task of various large valves urgently needed for Baotou Steel's blast furnace and coke oven. The factory's party branch secretary immediately convened a meeting of workshop leaders and cadres, took measures to arrange production, and the leading cadres and workers worked day and night in a concentrated effort; after completing a batch, the comrades of the factory's transportation team immediately braved the heavy rain to transport them to the railway station and sent them to Baotou by express mail, solving the urgent needs of the blast furnace and coke oven projects. More than 200 electric motors manufactured by Shanghai's "May 1st" and other three motor factories were scheduled to be delivered in the second, third, and fourth quarters of this year according to the order. In order to allow Baotou Steel to produce iron earlier, they all delivered the goods in full in July and August ahead of schedule. Some students from Beijing Aviation School voluntarily gave up their summer vacation time to rush to manufacture more than 200 gate valves for Baotou Steel, ensuring the urgent needs of the No. 3 Coke Oven.
    People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region regarded supporting the construction of Baotou Steel as a glorious political task. Under the direct leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, a Support Baotou Steel Construction Committee was established. This committee regularly sent people to the Baotou Steel construction site to understand Baotou Steel's needs, and did its best to give priority to supplying various non-standard equipment needed for the No. 1 Blast Furnace, daily necessities, and labor supplies needed by the workers. During the intense construction of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace, the Civil Aviation Administration of Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang, and other places used airplanes to rush various equipment to Baotou Steel. A motor vehicle battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been fighting alongside Baotou Steel workers for more than a year to support Baotou Steel.
    Anshan Steel, Wuhan Steel, Shijingshan Steel and other brother factories and mines not only trained a large number of production and construction personnel for Baotou Steel, but also promptly dispatched excellent workers and experts to support Baotou Steel whenever the construction was tense.

    (Our Newspaper, Baotou, 26th Dispatch) The first batch of industrial workers of minority nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has grown with the development of Baotou Steel construction. At present, there are 1,691 employees from 14 minority ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Korean, Daur, and Buyi, working in this world-class iron and steel complex, of which 574 are Mongolian.
    These minority workers, who not long ago were herdsmen on the grasslands, peasants in the countryside, local cadres, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, now hold leadership positions such as deputy general manager of the head office, party committee secretary and manager of branch companies. Some are engineers, workshop directors and team leaders. More people are directly mastering modern production technologies in various factories, mines, workshops, and engineering companies, working as fitters, welders, riveters, scaffolders, and lathe operators. Some have become electric shovel operators, drilling machine operators, and drivers of internal combustion locomotives and electric locomotives.
    Baotou Steel is the first modern iron and steel complex built by the state in a minority area. The Party Committee of Baotou Steel Corporation attaches great importance to the work of training minority workers. As early as December 1956, the Baotou Steel Party Committee formulated a plan for training Mongolian workers in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Inner Mongolia Party Committee. According to the plan, various branch companies have set up spare-time technical training classes for minority workers and sent them in batches to various steel plants in China for internships. Thirty-one people were sent to Baotou Institute of Technology for further study.
    After these minority workers took up their jobs, the leaders assigned veteran workers with higher technical levels as their teachers to help them master various modern production technologies. Now, in the Baiyun Obo iron mine, almost every modern equipment, such as drilling machines, electric shovels, and electric locomotives, has minority workers operating them.

    大跃进光芒万丈　大协作威力无穷
    各地支援包钢结下丰硕果实
    少数民族职工随着高炉的建成迅速成长
    本报包头26日电　包钢一号高炉的建设得到了全国人民的大力支援。全国二十多个省市的数百座工厂企业为包钢赶制各种机械设备、供应建筑材料，在技术力量方面给予支援，对保证包钢一号高炉胜利出铁作出了巨大贡献。
    包钢一号高炉和与其有关的焦化、水源和矿山等工程规模宏大，所需设备总量达二万六千吨。其中，除10％左右的重要设备由苏联等社会主义国家供给外，其余都是国内制造的。仅各地支援包钢的钢材、水泥、木材，就有八千多火车皮。包钢所需要的设备材料来自全国各地。这里使用的材料：有鞍钢的钢材，沈阳的电缆，上海的电嘴管，西安的轴承，广州的松香，兰州的石油和沥青，湖南的楠竹，大兴安岭的木材等。这里安装的炉顶设备、焦炉和热风炉设备等都是沈阳、哈尔滨、大连、上海、长沙、湘潭、贵州等地工厂承制的。
    根据全国一盘棋的方针，各地工厂在安排生产任务时，对于包钢所需要的机械设备和材料都尽量予以优先保证。沈阳阐阀厂接到承制包钢高炉和焦炉急需的各种大型阐阀的制造任务，厂里党总支书记立即召开车间领导干部会议，采取措施安排生产，领导干部和工人日夜突击；当完成一批后，厂里运输组的同志立即冒着大雨运到火车站，用快件发往包头，解决了高炉和焦炉工程的急需。由上海“五一”等三个电机厂承制的二百多台电动机，按订货单规定要在今年二、三、四季度分别交齐，他们为了让包钢早出铁，都提前在7、8月份就把货全部交齐。北京航空学校的部分学生，自愿放弃暑假休息时间，给包钢赶制二百多个通阀，保证了三号焦炉的急需。
    内蒙古自治区各族人民，把支援包钢建设当作一项光荣的政治任务。在中共内蒙古自治区委员会直接领导下，成立了支援包钢建设委员会，这个委员会经常派人深入包钢工地，了解包钢的需要，对一号高炉所需要的各种非标准设备、职工们需要的日用物资、劳动用品，都尽量做到优先供应。在包钢一号高炉紧张施工期间，上海、北京、沈阳等地民航局用飞机给包钢赶运各种设备。中国人民解放军某部汽车营，为了支援包钢，已和包钢职工在一起奋战了一年多的时间。
    鞍钢、武钢、石钢及其他兄弟厂矿，不但为包钢培训了大批生产建设人员，每逢施工紧张阶段，还及时派出优秀工人和专家前来支援包钢。
    本报包头26日电　内蒙古自治区第一批少数民族的产业工人队伍，已经随着包钢建设的发展成长起来。现在，在这个世界第一流的钢铁联合企业里工作的蒙古、回、满、朝鲜、达斡尔、布依等十四个少数民族职工共有一千六百九十一人，其中蒙古族职工有五百七十四人。
    这些不久以前还是草原上的牧民、农村里的农民和地方干部、人民解放军的军官和战士的少数民族职工，现在有的担任总公司副经理、分公司党委书记、经理等领导职务，有的是工程师、车间主任和工段长，更多的人是在各个厂矿、车间、工程公司里直接掌握现代化生产技术，担任钳工、电焊、铆工、架工、车工的工作，还有一些人成了电铲手、穿孔机手、内燃机车和电机车的司机。
    包钢是国家在少数民族地区建设的第一个现代化的钢铁联合企业。包钢总公司党委对培养少数民族职工的工作非常重视。早在1956年12月，包钢党委就根据中央和内蒙古党委的指示，制定了培养蒙古族工人的规划。按照规划，各个分公司都为少数民族职工设立了业余技术训练班，成批成批地优先选送他们到国内各钢铁厂去实习，有三十一人被送到包头工学院去深造。
    这些少数民族职工走上工作岗位以后，领导上都指定技术水平较高的老工人做他们的老师，帮助他们掌握各种近代化的生产技术。现在白云鄂博铁矿山，几乎每一台现代化的设备，如穿孔机、电铲、电机车上，都有少数民族的工人在操作。
