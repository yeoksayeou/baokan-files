    The Source of Victory
    ——A Visit with the Algerian Women's Delegation
    By our correspondents Yu Minsheng and Yuan Mu
    Today, the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation has entered a new stage. The Algerian National Liberation Army, with the full support of the people, is winning victories and annihilating French colonial troops by the hundreds and thousands. The news is encouraging. It was at such a time that we visited the Algerian Women's Delegation.
    "Our National Liberation Army has grown from 3,000 men when the war began in 1954 to 130,000 today. It has developed from the most primitive weapons to today's modern equipment. Although the French colonialists have 650,000 troops and 200,000 military police, they can never defeat the Algerian National Liberation Army, because our army has the support of the entire people." At the beginning of the conversation, the head of the delegation, Mrs. Mamia Chentouf, expressed such firm confidence.
    The French colonialists are slaughtering thousands of civilians in Algeria, burning farms, destroying houses, bombing cities with airplanes, torturing and killing Algerian patriotic fighters, and harming women and children. Since the beginning of the anti-colonial struggle, more than 600,000 Algerian military personnel and civilians have been killed, and more than 500,000 Algerian refugees have been driven to Tunisia and Morocco. In the border areas where Algeria borders Tunisia and Morocco, the French colonialists created a no-man's land 50 kilometers wide and 200 kilometers long, frantically clamoring to eliminate everything that moves in this area. They also detained more than one million Algerians in areas connected to the Algerian National Liberation Army, concentrating them in so-called "agglomeration camps," cruelly ravaging them, and attempting to prevent Algerians from joining the National Liberation Army and supporting the war of liberation.
    However, no matter how cruel the enemy is, the Algerian people will never yield. They are united and fully support the National Liberation Army. The relationship between our army and the people is like fish and water, as close as milk and water!
    After finishing these words, the head of the delegation introduced us to a member of the delegation, Miss Menouba Khaled. She said, "Miss Menouba has been working in the National Liberation Army. She can talk about the people's support for the National Liberation Army."
    Miss Menouba told us that this year, during the most intense period of the war of liberation, she traveled through a long enemy-held area to the eastern battlefield. Many things she saw along the way about the people supporting the National Liberation Army deeply moved her. The people there lived two lives, a life during the day and a life at night. During the day, the people were busy with production and preparing food and clothing for the National Liberation Army. Whenever the sun went down, busy activities to support the war began. Many old people, women, and children trekked and waded through mountains and rivers to transport large quantities of clothing and supplies to the mountains to deliver to the National Liberation Army. When the army arrived, the people had almost everything ready: food and fodder were complete, animals for carrying weapons and ammunition were saddled, herdsmen led the way for the soldiers, and children passed on information for the soldiers.
    Once, Miss Menouba spent the night in the home of a poor peasant family. Seven members of this family had joined the National Liberation Army, leaving only an old woman, a middle-aged woman, and a child. Their only property was a milk cow and a milk goat. When Miss Menouba went to their home, the child was breastfeeding. But the dry nipple had no milk at all. Miss Menouba asked the woman, "Why don't you give the milk to the child to drink?" The woman repeatedly said, "No, no, this milk is reserved for the National Liberation Army. They need to be strong to fight the enemy!"
    Another time, Miss Menouba came to a village to find the village government. As soon as she entered the village, she met a child. She asked the child where the village government was. Who knew that the child mistakenly thought she was French and refused to tell her. Later, Miss Menouba spoke to him in the local dialect, told him stories of the National Liberation Army's battles, and showed him the National Liberation Army's identification card. Only then did the child happily lead her to the village government.
    The Algerian guests repeatedly emphasized to us the great contributions of Algerian women in the liberation struggle. Many adult men in Algeria have joined the Liberation Army. Women not only bear the task of production, but also the heavy task of supporting the war. And they are the first to bear the brunt of the enemy's destruction and humiliation. However, the Algerian women are staunch and unyielding.
    Many Algerian women have joined the National Liberation Army, fighting the French army with guns. In the battles, many people heroically sacrificed themselves, and many were arrested and imprisoned, enduring torture and remaining unyielding until death. Speaking of this, Mrs. Chentouf and Mrs. Reila deeply missed one of their friends, also a female soldier of the National Liberation Army. Her name was Fissa Hamot. At the beginning of the war, Fissa Hamot worked as a doctor in a hospital in Algiers. At that time, she risked great danger and secretly treated the wounds of many soldiers of the National Liberation Army in her hospital. Later, when the enemy discovered this, she left the hospital in May 1956, joined the National Liberation Army as a doctor, and was captured by the enemy while rescuing the wounded on the front line in a battle in November of the same year. She was imprisoned for three months and then released. After being released from prison, she returned to the army and treated the soldiers even more enthusiastically. However, in a battle at the end of 1957, she was unfortunately captured by the enemy again and is still being held in a concentration camp. There, she has never stopped fighting against the enemy. "Contribute the greatest strength to the war!" This is the slogan of action for all Algerian people. The guests then told us the story of a support-the-front competition between two neighboring villages. In these two adjacent villages, the people of one village actively supported the war and made many contributions. Therefore, the wired broadcast of the National Liberation Army often broadcast their merits. What about the people of the other village? They also made contributions to supporting the war of liberation, but not as much as the previous village. They had never heard their news from the wired broadcast. Therefore, the people of this village held a village meeting and decided to compete with the neighboring village to see who made the greater contribution to the war of liberation. After the village meeting, the whole village turned out to destroy an important road that the enemy had to pass, preventing the enemy from approaching the village. As a result, the news was indeed broadcast on the wired broadcast. After that, the people of this village supported the National Liberation Army even more enthusiastically! With the full support of the people, the Algerian National Liberation Army more bravely attacked the French invading army, causing the enemy to suffer the most惨重 failures. The recent unprecedented great victories of the Algerian National Liberation Army in the two battles of Boni and Annaba mark that the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown into a powerful armed force. The enthusiastic support of millions of Algerian patriotic people is the infinite source of strength for the strong development and victory of this armed force.

    胜利的源泉
    ——阿尔及利亚妇女代表团访问记
    本报记者　于民生　袁木
    今天，阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争，已经跨上了一个新的阶段，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在人民的全力支持下，节节胜利，成百成千地消灭法国殖民军队，消息传来，令人振奋。就在这样的时候，我们访问了阿尔及利亚妇女代表团。
    “我们的民族解放军已经由1954年战争开始时的三千人，发展到今天的十三万人，由最原始的武器，发展到今天的现代化装备。尽管法国殖民主义者拥有六十五万军队，二十万宪兵警察，但是它永远也不能战胜阿尔及利亚民族解放军，因为我们的军队有全国人民的支持。”谈话一开始，代表团团长玛米娅·申杜芙夫人就表示了这样坚定的信心。
    法国殖民主义者正在阿尔及利亚屠杀成千的平民，烧毁农庄，毁坏住房，用飞机炸毁城市，拷打和屠杀阿尔及利亚爱国志士，残害妇女和儿童。自从反殖民主义斗争开始以来，已有六十多万阿尔及利亚军事人员和平民被杀害，被驱逐到突尼斯和摩洛哥的阿尔及利亚难民达五十多万。在阿尔及利亚同突尼斯和摩洛哥接壤的边境地方，法国殖民者制造了宽五十公里、长二百公里的无人区，疯狂地扬言要在这个地区消灭一切动的东西。他们还在同阿尔及利亚民族解放军相接连的地带，拘禁了一百多万阿尔及利亚人，把他们集中在所谓“聚合营”里，对他们横加蹂躏，妄图杜绝阿尔及利亚人参加民族解放军和支援解放战争。
    但是，不管敌人是如何残酷，阿尔及利亚人民是永不屈服的，他们团结一致，全力支持民族解放军，我们的军民关系像鱼离不开水一样，是乳水交融的！
    团长在讲完这些话以后，向我们介绍了代表团的一位团员梅努巴·卡勒德小姐。她说：“梅努巴小姐一直在民族解放军里工作，她可以谈谈人民支援民族解放军的情形。”
    梅努巴小姐告诉我们，今年在解放战争最激烈的时候，她曾穿过漫长的敌后地区到东部战场，沿路看到的人民支援民族解放军的许多事情使她非常感动。那里的人民过着两种生活，一种是白天的生活，一种是夜里的生活。在白天，人民一方面忙着生产，一方面又要为民族解放军准备衣食。每当太阳落山的时候，繁忙的支援战争的活动就开始了，许许多多老人、妇女和儿童，跋山涉水，把大批大批的衣食物资运到山里去送给民族解放军。当军队一到，人民几乎把一切都准备好了：粮草齐全，驮运武器弹药的牲口上了鞍，牧人为战士领路，儿童为战士们传情报。
    有一次，梅努巴小姐露宿在一户贫苦的农民家里，这家有七个人参加了民族解放军，只剩下一个老太太、一个中年妇女和一个小孩，她们唯一的财产就是一只奶牛和一只奶羊。当梅努巴小姐到她们家里去的时候，孩子正在吃母亲的奶。可是那干枯的奶头啊，一点乳汁也没有。梅努巴小姐问那妇女：“为什么不把牛奶拿来给孩子吃？”那妇女连连说：“不能，不能，这牛奶是留给民族解放军的，他们吃了好打敌人！”
    又一次，梅努巴小姐来到一个村庄找村政府。一进村口就遇见一个儿童，她问这个儿童村政府在什么地方，谁知那儿童竟错认为她是法国人呢，因此怎么也不肯告诉她。后来，梅努巴小姐用当地土话同他交谈，给他讲民族解放军的战斗故事，并且把民族解放军的证件给他看，这个儿童才兴高彩烈地带她到村政府去了。
    阿尔及利亚的客人们一再向我们强调阿尔及利亚妇女在解放斗争中的伟大贡献。阿尔及利亚许多壮年男人都参加了解放军，妇女们不但担负着生产的任务，而且繁重的支援战争的任务也落在她们身上。而敌人的摧残和侮辱，她们更是首当其冲。然而，阿尔及利亚的妇女是坚贞不屈的。
    有许许多多阿尔及利亚妇女参加了民族解放军，持枪跟法国军队作战。在战斗里，有不少人英勇牺牲了，不少人被捕坐牢，受尽酷刑拷打，至死不屈。谈到这里，申杜芙夫人和雷拉夫人都深深地怀念起她们的一位女友，也是民族解放军的一位女战士。她的名字叫菲莎哈莫特。在战争开始的时候，菲莎哈莫特在阿尔及尔的一所医院里作医生，那时，她冒着极大的危险，曾经在自己的医院里偷偷治好了许多民族解放军的战士的创伤。后来被敌人发觉了，她就在1956年5月离开了这所医院，参加了民族解放军作医生，到同年11月的一次战斗里，她到火线上抢救伤员被敌人俘虏，监禁了三个月后释放。出狱以后，她又回到军队，更加热心地为战士们治疗。可是在1957年底的一次战斗中，她又不幸被敌人俘虏了，直到现在她还被关在集中营里。在那里，她一刻也没有停止同敌人的斗争。“为战争贡献出最大的力量！”这是全体阿尔及利亚人民的行动口号。客人们接着给我们讲了两个邻村的支前竞赛的故事。在这两个毗邻的村庄中，一个村庄的人民积极支援战争，有很多贡献，所以在民族解放军的有线广播里，经常广播他们的功绩。另一个村庄的人民呢？他们对支援解放战争也有贡献，但是不如前一个村庄，他们没有从有线广播中听到过自己的消息。因此，这个村庄的人民就开了一个村民大会，决定要同邻村比一比，看谁对解放战争的贡献大。村民大会以后，全村人出动，把敌人要经过的一条重要公路破坏了，使敌人不得近村。于是，有线广播里果然传布了这个消息。这以后，这个村子的人民就更加热情地支援民族解放军了！在全国人民全力支持下，阿尔及利亚民族解放军更加英勇地打击法国侵略军，使敌人遭受到最惨重的失败。最近阿尔及利亚民族解放军在波尼和安若拉两次战斗中取得空前的伟大的胜利，这标志着阿尔及利亚民族解放军已经成长为一支强大的武装力量。千百万阿尔及利亚爱国人民的热情支持，是这支武装部队强大发展走向胜利的无限泉源。
