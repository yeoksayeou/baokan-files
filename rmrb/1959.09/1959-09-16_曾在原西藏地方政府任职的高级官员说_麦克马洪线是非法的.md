Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 15th: Some upper-class figures in Tibet who successively held senior official positions such as Silun (whose position in the Tibetan local government, i.e., the Kashag government, was above the Kashag government, second only to the Dalai Lama) and Kalon (member of the Kashag government) in the former Tibetan local government have cited numerous facts to prove that the so-called McMahon Line has always been illegal.

These upper-class figures include Langdun Gonga Wangqiu, nephew of the 13th Dalai Lama, who served as Silun for sixteen years, and Gashe Quji Nima and Ranba Tudan Gunqing, who were already Kalons before India's independence.

Langdun Gonga Wangqiu, who served as Silun from 1926 to 1942, said, "After I became Silun, the 13th Dalai Lama instructed me, 'I am old and cannot handle all matters. You must work hard, especially on border issues. Study them carefully and handle them cautiously. When dealing with foreigners, be extra vigilant. The borders of Tibet must not be given to other countries arbitrarily, otherwise it will cause trouble for future generations.'" Based on his instructions, I collected materials related to the border and found the relevant documents of the Simla Conference secretly hidden by reactionary officials. I saw the detailed report of the Simla Conference written by Xiazha (the representative of the Tibetan local government attending the Simla Conference), as well as the instructions from the 13th Dalai Lama to Xiazha and letters to the British.

Langdun Gonga Wangqiu said: Before the secret exchange of notes, Xiazha sent Zhongyi Qingbo (Chief Secretary) Danba Daji back with a letter to the Dalai Lama for instructions. The letter said: The British representative stated that if the Indo-Tibetan border could be demarcated, the British government would still do everything possible to help Tibet's cause in the future, and requested to sign and seal the map marked with the red line (i.e., the McMahon Line) dividing the Indo-Tibetan border. The Dalai Lama was very angry after seeing the letter and immediately replied to Xiazha, instructing him never to give Tibet's territory to anyone. If such an agreement were signed, you would be severely punished upon your return. Xiazha was very panicked after receiving the letter. However, the British put pressure on him on the one hand and offered to give him 5,000 guns and 500,000 rounds of ammunition as conditions on the other hand, finally deceiving him into exchanging notes. When Xiazha returned to Lhasa, in order to provide a basis for future foreign affairs officials, the Dalai Lama not only ordered him to write a detailed report on the Simla Conference but also wrote a letter to the British government, refusing to recognize the exchange of notes on the demarcation of the Tibetan-Indian border. The main reasons stated in the letter were: The Chinese government did not stamp the Simla Treaty and the relevant exchange of notes on the Tibetan-British (Indian) border, which is very important, and we cannot recognize it.

Langdun Gonga Wangqiu also said that before the 13th Dalai Lama and during his administration, all major events in Tibet, especially those involving foreign affairs, had to be jointly discussed and decided by representatives of the three major monasteries (Sera Monastery, Ganden Monastery, and Drepung Monastery), Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, Sakya Monastery, and Kashag officials. The secret exchange of notes concerning the Tibetan-Indian border did not go through this procedure. Therefore, as far as the Tibetan local government in China alone is concerned, it is also illegal.

Gashe Quji Nima and Ranba Tudan Gunqing, who successively served as Kalons from 1943 to 1949, also pointed out that from the end of the Simla Conference to before India's independence, the British government never publicly mentioned the so-called McMahon Line to the Kashag. During this period, the British, under the pretext of collecting biological specimens, repeatedly requested the Kashag to send people to areas such as Menda Wang (south of the so-called McMahon Line). Each time, the Kashag issued passes and limited their activity dates, which shows that the Kashag has been governing the area south of the so-called McMahon Line. Around World War II, British troops invaded some strongholds on the border south of the so-called McMahon Line, which was resisted by the local people, and the Kashag protested.

Gashe Quji Nima said that in 1947, the Kashag received a letter from the British government, roughly saying: Britain has granted India independence. Whether to act according to the original treaty or establish a new agreement on the Indo-Tibetan border issue should be resolved by India and Tibet. During the same period, the Kashag also received a letter from the Indian government, which, after stating similar meanings, wanted to occupy the area south of the so-called McMahon Line and sent troops to invade some places on the border south of this line, which aroused great indignation among the Tibetan people, who demanded that the Kashag take measures. The Kashag immediately convened representatives of the three major monasteries and local government officials at Norbulingka to discuss the matter. According to the decision of the meeting, the Kashag sent a telegram to Prime Minister Nehru, once again denying the secret exchange of notes concerning the border, stating that not even half an inch of land could be given away, and demanding that India return other territories of Tibet that had been occupied.

Gashe Quji Nima said that between 1947 and 1949, officials and the masses in areas such as Menda Wang and Jintangzong repeatedly sent emergency reports to the Kashag, saying that Indian troops had invaded the territory. The Kashag repeatedly negotiated and protested to India. Local residents also protested to the invading Indian troops, saying, "We are Tibetans, and we are not governed by Indians." Only before and after the peaceful liberation of Tibet did Indian troops further invade large areas of territory south of the so-called McMahon Line, preventing local people from traveling to the Tibetan local government to pay taxes, and in 1951, they detained the Tibetan local government officials who were originally in Menda Wang.

When these Tibetan upper-class figures talked about the Indian government inheriting the disgraceful legacy of British imperialism and invading the territory of the Tibetan local government of China, they were all very indignant. Langdun Gonga Wangqiu emphasized that the young people at the time of the Simla Conference are now old men. When China was bullied, neither the central government nor the Tibetan local government recognized the so-called McMahon Line. Today, when the Chinese people have stood up and all ethnic groups are united to build a prosperous and strong motherland, the Indian government is trying to impose this shameful and illegal border on us, which the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate. We Tibetans are the first to firmly oppose it!

### 曾在原西藏地方政府任职的高级官员说  麦克马洪线是非法的

    曾在原西藏地方政府任职的高级官员说
    麦克马洪线是非法的
    新华社拉萨15日电　曾先后在原西藏地方政府担任司伦（地位在西藏地方政府即噶厦政府之上，仅低于达赖喇嘛）、噶伦（噶厦政府的委员）等高级官职的一些西藏上层人士，举出大量事实证明所谓麦克马洪线从来就是非法的。
    这些上层人士中包括十三世达赖喇嘛的侄子、担任过十六年司伦的朗顿·滚噶旺秋，印度独立前就已任噶伦的噶雪·曲吉尼玛和然巴·图丹滚清等。
    从1926年到1942年担任司伦的朗顿·滚噶旺秋说，我当司伦以后，十三世达赖喇嘛指示我说：“我年纪大了，不能处理全部事情，你要好好工作，特别是边境问题，要细心钻研，慎重处理，和外国人来往，要加倍警惕，有关西藏的边境，不能随意让给别的国家，不然就会给后辈人造成麻烦。”根据他的指示，我就搜集有关边境材料，找到了被反动官员们密藏着的西姆拉会议的有关文件，看到了夏扎（西藏地方政府出席西姆拉会议的代表）所写的西姆拉会议的详细报告以及十三世达赖给夏扎的指示和给英国人的函件。
    朗顿·滚噶旺秋说：在秘密换文前，夏扎派仲译清波（大秘书）丹巴达吉带信回来向达赖请示，信中说：英国代表称，印藏边界如能划定，对西藏的事业英国政府今后仍要尽一切可能给予帮助，要求在标有划分印藏边界的红线（即麦克马洪线）地图上签字盖章。达赖看到信后非常气愤，当即回信指示夏扎说，绝不能把西藏地方领土让给任何人，要是签订了这样的文约，回来时要重重处罚你。夏扎接到信后非常恐慌。但英国人一方面对他施加压力，一方面以送五千支枪、五十万发子弹为条件，终于欺骗他换了文。夏扎回到拉萨时，达赖为使以后办外事的人有根据，除责令他把西姆拉会议的经过详细写成书面报告外，又写信给英国政府，不承认藏印边境划界的换文。信中申述的主要理由是：西姆拉条约和有关藏英（印）边境换文，中国政府都没有盖章，这一点关系非常重大，我们不能承认。
    朗顿·滚噶旺秋还说，十三世达赖以前和他执政时，西藏地方凡属重大事件特别是涉外事情，一定要经过三大寺（色拉寺、噶丹寺、哲蚌寺）、扎什伦布寺和萨迦寺的代表和噶厦官员共同商议决定，有关藏印边境的秘密换文，没有经过这样程序，因此，仅就中国一个地方的西藏地方政府来说，它也是非法的。
    在1943到1949年间先后担任噶伦的噶雪·曲吉尼玛和然巴·图丹滚清还指出，从西姆拉会议结束到印度独立前这段期间，英国政府从来也没有公开向噶厦提过有关所谓麦克马洪线的事情。这段期间，英国人借口采集生物，曾多次向噶厦请求，派人到门达旺等地区（在所谓麦克马洪线以南），每次都由噶厦签发通行证，并限定他们活动日期，这说明噶厦一直在管辖所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区。第二次世界大战前后，英国军队曾侵占所谓麦克马洪线以南边境上的一些据点，受到了当地人的反抗，噶厦并提出过抗议。
    噶雪·曲吉尼玛说，1947年噶厦曾收到一份英国政府的函件，大意说：英国已让印度独立，关于印藏边界问题，是根据原有条约行事或是另立协定，由印藏双方解决。同一时期，噶厦也接到印度政府交来的函件，在申述了类似的意义之后，要占领所谓麦克马洪线以南的地区，并派兵侵占了这条线以南边界上的一些地点，引起了西藏人民的极大愤慨，要求噶厦采取措施。噶厦立即在罗布林卡召集三大寺代表、地方政府官员进行讨论，根据会议的决定，噶厦曾致电尼赫鲁总理，再一次否认有关边境的秘密换文，表示半寸土地也不能让出去，并要印度归还已占领的西藏地方的其他领土。
    噶雪·曲吉尼玛说，在1947年到1949年间，门达旺、金东宗等地区的官员和群众曾多次向噶厦送来紧急报告，说印度兵侵占了领土，噶厦曾多次向印度交涉和抗议。当地居民也向入侵的印度军队抗议说，我们是西藏人，我们不受印度人管。和平解放西藏前后，印度军队才进一步侵占了所谓麦克马洪线以南的大片领土，不让当地人民向西藏地方政府出差交税，并在1951年把原在门达旺的西藏地方政府官员拘留起来。
    当这些西藏上层人士谈到印度政府继承英帝国主义不光采的遗产，侵占了中国西藏地方领土时，都非常愤慨。朗顿·滚噶旺秋强调指出：西姆拉会议时的青年人，现在都成了老头子，当中国受人欺凌的时候，中央政府和西藏地方政府都没有承认所谓麦克马洪线，今天，当中国人民站起来和各族人民团结起来建设繁荣富强祖国的时候，印度政府却企图把这个见不得人的非法边界线强加在我们头上，那是中国人民绝对不能容忍的，我们藏族人民首先坚决反对！
