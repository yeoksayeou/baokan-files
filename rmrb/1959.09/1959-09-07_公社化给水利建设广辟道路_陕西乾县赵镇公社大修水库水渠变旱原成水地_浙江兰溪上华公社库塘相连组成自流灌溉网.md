Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch. Cadres and members of the Zhao Town People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, after a year of effort, have realized the long-cherished desire of the broad masses of farmers to change the face of the arid plains. Now, three reservoirs and a three-stage pumping station have been basically completed, capable of irrigating 79,000 mu of land, accounting for 73% of the commune's dryland farmland area. After a recent rainstorm, the floodwater stored in the reservoirs and a small amount of canal and well water have already irrigated more than 20,000 mu of autumn fields.

This commune is located in the mountainous area of the Weibei Arid Plains, characterized by drought and water shortage, with wells ranging from 50 to 130 feet deep. Whenever there was a drought, not only were the crops affected, but even people's drinking water was seriously threatened. After the formation of mutual aid teams after liberation, only the Duan Peigong mutual aid team used state loans to dig a well capable of irrigating two mu of land. After the establishment of the primary agricultural cooperative, the strength was greater, and in 1955, 50 wells were dug. After the establishment of the advanced agricultural cooperative, the strength became even greater, and in 1956 and 1957, 367 wells were dug, and the irrigated area increased fourfold compared with before the cooperative movement.

In the first half of 1958, the members saw that relying solely on digging wells could not solve the problem, and they urgently demanded a fundamental change in the face of the arid plains. Therefore, the various agricultural cooperatives in this area, under the leadership of the Party and with state investment and assistance, successively drew a group of laborers from February and March to start constructing the Beitun Pumping Station and the Xiaohe Reservoir. Because the work was carried out in cooperation with many advanced cooperatives, there were many difficulties in organizing and allocating labor. For example, the beneficiary areas had to both build water conservancy projects and carry out agricultural production, and they could not spare enough labor; but it was difficult to organize non-beneficiary areas to cooperate and support; the economic strength of each agricultural cooperative was both weak and dispersed, making it even more difficult to give full play to its role.

Under the common desire to build water conservancy projects on a large scale to change the face of the arid plains, and after the practical education of several years of cooperation, especially the education of cooperation among many cooperatives in building water conservancy projects, the peasants deeply realized the greatness of collective strength. The Zhao Town People's Commune was established under these circumstances. After the establishment of the People's Commune, because of its large scale and wide range of activities, it could uniformly plan the construction of the entire commune, which not only accelerated the construction of the previous water conservancy projects, but also started the construction of the new and larger Zhuanghe Reservoir and Yanxia Reservoir. From the establishment of the commune to now, more than 369,000 labor days have been used, more than 222,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work have been done, and more than 80% of the total engineering tasks have been completed. After these projects are completed, all the dryland in this commune can be irrigated by canal water, becoming irrigated land with double insurance from canals and reservoirs.

Compared with the cooperative movement, building water conservancy projects under the unified leadership of the commune is not only larger in scale and faster in speed, but also saves a large amount of state investment. Before communization, this area had done more than 100,000 cubic meters of water conservancy projects, and the state investment reached more than 230,000 yuan. After communization, due to the effective and rational allocation of the commune's labor force and means of production, many production tools that originally cost money were solved by internal adjustment within the commune or brought by the members themselves, and the state only subsidized more than 50,000 yuan, which completed more than twice as much water conservancy projects as in the past. At the same time, the entire commune uniformly scheduled and rationally arranged agricultural work and labor, which was better than in any previous year, and increased production. This year's wheat yield increased from 123.5 jin per mu last year to 225.5 jin per mu. The sowing, fertilization and field management of autumn fields were also finer and better than last year.

These water conservancy projects have begun to benefit during the construction process. The Zhuanghe Reservoir, which required a 25-meter-high dam, only had 15 meters completed by August 5. That day, water was stored in time to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of autumn fields. In the past year, the flood in this ditch had washed away 7,942 mu of crops and 22 houses, causing serious losses. Now, this harmful ditch has become a beneficial ditch.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch. After three months of large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring by the Shanghua People's Commune in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, 94% of the commune's 63,678 mu of paddy fields have achieved self-flow irrigation, and the drought resistance capacity has increased from 75 days in the spring of 1958 to more than 130 days.

The terrain of Shanghua Commune is characterized by semi-mountainous areas in the northeast and hilly areas in the southwest, with high elevations at both ends and a low elevation in the middle. Floods and droughts occur alternately, seriously threatening production and people's lives. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the peasants built water conservancy projects for years, and water conservancy conditions have been improved. However, at that time, due to the small townships and small cooperatives, the water conservancy projects built were scattered and unsystematic, and the surplus and deficiency of water could not be adjusted. 75% of the cultivated land in the entire commune needed to be irrigated by waterwheels, which required more than 500,000 workdays per year.

After the people's commune, the commune Party committee relied on the masses and made a comprehensive water conservancy construction plan, determined to achieve self-flow irrigation. The entire commune organized a professional water conservancy corps of more than 2,000 laborers and more than 3,000 temporary shock laborers according to the production season, and marched vigorously toward nature. After three months of hard work and skillful work, a medium-sized reservoir with a water storage capacity of 5.5 million cubic meters was newly built, 33 large, medium and small reservoirs and ponds were expanded, and 94 large and small canals equivalent to 212 li in length were opened up. The entire commune, with 18 large reservoirs as the backbone and 1,800 ponds connected in series, formed a grape-bunch-shaped self-flow irrigation network.

The self-flowing irrigation has greatly promoted the development of agricultural production. In the past, it took more than 500,000 workdays to operate waterwheels every year, but this year it only takes 158 reservoir managers and water releasers, and it is possible to plan water use and carry out shallow and frequent irrigation. Because the labor force saved has been used for field operations, this year not only the rice transplanting was advanced by 15 to 20 days, but also the number of weeding and fertilization was increased, and at the same time, there was enough labor force to strengthen the management of low-yielding fields. Therefore, this year, more than 40,000 mu of early and mid-season rice have achieved a large-scale balanced bumper harvest, with an average yield per mu increasing by about 40% compared with last year.

Self-flowing irrigation, with abundant water sources, has also created conditions for land reform in the entire commune, and more than 9,000 mu of dry land in the entire commune can now be transformed into paddy fields. This year, 1,720 mu have been converted to rice cultivation, increasing grain production by more than 510,000 jin; more than 1,000 mu of rotten paddy fields have been transformed into good fields due to the smooth drainage after water conservancy. At the same time, more than 8,000 mu of double-cropping late rice has been expanded, which can increase grain production by 1.51 million jin.

With the development of production, the income of the members has greatly increased. This year, the summer harvest distribution in the entire commune averaged 116 yuan per person, an increase of 42% compared with last year.

Now this commune is moving towards the direction of "multi-purpose water use." The members are rushing to build a hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 250 kilowatts, which will be able to generate electricity by the end of the month.

    公社化给水利建设广辟道路
    陕西乾县赵镇公社大修水库水渠变旱原成水地
    浙江兰溪上华公社库塘相连组成自流灌溉网
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省乾县赵镇人民公社领导社员经过一年的努力，实现了广大农民千百年来要求改变旱原面貌的愿望。现在，三个水库和一个三级抽水站已基本建成，可灌溉土地七万九千亩，占全社旱原耕地面积的73％。在最近一次暴雨后，水库所蓄的洪水和少量的渠水、井水，已经灌溉秋田二万余亩。
    这个公社位于渭北旱原靠山地区，干旱缺水，井深五丈到十三丈。每逢干旱，不仅庄稼受旱，连人的吃水也受到严重威胁。解放后组织了互助组以后，只有段培功互助组用国家贷款，打了能灌二亩地的一眼井。初级社成立后力量较大，1955年就打了五十眼井。高级社成立后力量更大了，1956年和1957年，就打了三百六十七眼井，水地面积比合作化以前增加了四倍。
    1958年上半年，社员们看到光靠打井还不能解决问题，迫切要求从根本上改变旱原面貌。于是，这个地区的各个农业社，在党的领导和国家投资援助下，从2、3月份起陆续抽出一批劳力，动工修建北屯抽水站和小河水库。因为工作是许多高级社配合进行的。所以在组织调拨劳力上，有很多困难。如受益地区既要兴修水利，又要进行农业生产，劳力顾不过来；但又很难组织非受益地区的劳动力协作支援；各个农业社的经济力量既薄弱又分散，更难充分发挥作用。
    在大规模兴办水利改变旱原面貌的共同愿望下，经过几年来合作化的实践教育，特别是经过许多社协作兴修水利的教育，农民深深体会到集体力量的伟大。赵镇人民公社就是在这种情况下建立的。人民公社成立之后，由于规模大，活动范围广，能统一筹划全社的建设，不但加快了以前的水利工程建设，新的规模更大的庄河蓄水库和烟霞蓄水库又动工了。从公社成立到现在，已经用了三十六万九千多个劳动工日，做了土、石工程二十二万二千多立方米，完成了全部工程任务的80％以上。这些工程修成后，这个社的全部旱原都可用渠水灌溉，成为渠和水库双保险的水地。
    在公社统一领导下兴修水利，和合作化时相比，不仅规模大，速度又快，还能节省国家大量投资。公社化以前，这个地区总共做了十万多立方米的水利工程，国家投资就达二十三万多元。公社化以后，由于有效地合理地调度了全社劳力和生产资料，许多原来要花钱的生产工具，由社内自己调剂解决或社员们自带，国家仅仅补助了五万多元，就完成了超过过去一倍多的水利工程。同时，全社又把农活、劳力进行了统一调度和合理安排，比以往任何一年都种的好，管的好，并且增加了产量。今年小麦由去年亩产一百二十三斤半增加到二百二十五斤半。秋田的播种、施肥和田间管理上，也都比去年又细又好。
    这些水利工程在修建过程中，就已开始受益了。庄河蓄水库，要修二十五米高的水坝，到8月5日只修了十五米，当天蓄下水，及时灌了一万多亩秋田。而在去年，这道沟的洪水曾冲掉庄稼七千九百四十二亩、房屋二十二间等，造成严重的损失。现在，这条害沟变成利沟了。
    据新华社杭州讯　浙江省兰溪县上华人民公社经过去冬今春三个月的大规模兴修水利，全社六万三千六百七十八亩水田，有94％实现了自流灌溉，抗旱能力从1958年春季的七十五天，提高到一百三十多天。
    上华公社的地势，东北是半山区，西南是丘陵地带，两头高，中间低。洪旱交错发生，严重威胁着生产和人民生活。解放后，在党的领导下，农民连年兴修水利，水利条件有所改善。但当时由于是小乡小社，兴修的水利工程分散不系统，水量余缺不能调剂，全社75％的耕地需要车水灌溉，每年车水要用五十多万个工。
    人民公社化后，公社党委依靠群众，作出了全面兴修水利的规划，决心实现自流灌溉。全社根据生产季节，组织了有二千多名劳力参加的专业水利兵团，和三千多名临时性突击的劳动力，浩浩荡荡向大自然进军。经过三个月的苦干、巧干，新建蓄水五百五十万立方米的中型水库一座，扩建大、中、小型水库和山塘三十三处，开辟了相当于二百一十二华里长的大、小水渠九十四条。全社以十八个大型水库为骨干和一千八百个水塘串联起来，形成了一个葡萄串形的自流灌溉网。
    灌溉自流化大大促进了农业生产的发展。过去每年要花五十多万个工车水，今年只需一百五十八个水库管理员和放水员就够了，而且能够计划用水，浅灌勤灌。由于节省出来的劳动力用到了田间操作上，今年不仅水稻插秧提早十五至二十天，耘田、施肥的次数也增加了，同时对低产田也有足够的劳动力加强了管理。因此，今年四万多亩早中稻达到大面积平衡丰收，平均亩产量比去年增产40％左右。
    自流灌溉，水源充足，还给全社的土地改制创造了条件，全社九千多亩旱地从此可以改造成水田。今年已有一千七百二十亩改种了水稻，增产粮食五十一万多斤；一千多亩烂水田，由于水利化后排水畅通改造成良田。同时，扩种了双季晚稻八千多亩，可多收粮食一百五十一万斤。
    随着生产的发展，社员的收入大大增加，今年全社夏收分配，平均每人收入一百一十六元，比去年增加42％。
    现在这个社正向“一水多用”的方向迈进，社员们正在赶修一座发电量二百五十瓩的水电站，这座电站在月底即可发电。
