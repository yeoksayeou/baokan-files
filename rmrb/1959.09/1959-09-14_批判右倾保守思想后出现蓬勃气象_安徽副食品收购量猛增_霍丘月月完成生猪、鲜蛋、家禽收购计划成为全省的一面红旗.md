From our newspaper in Hefei, 13th: After commercial departments in various parts of Anhui Province criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some cadres, the procurement and transportation of non-staple foods showed a vigorous new atmosphere, based on the principles of "procuring more, procuring quickly, procuring well, and procuring enough." According to statistics, in mid-August, the province's procurement of live pigs, fresh fish, poultry, etc., increased by 30% to 100% compared to the first ten days of the month, and the daily procurement progress in the last ten days of the month increased by 50% to 300% compared to the middle ten days of the month.

In order to welcome the peak season for purchase and sale on the basis of the great achievements already made, commercial departments in various parts of Anhui have recently, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, criticized the right-leaning thinking of a few cadres, further strengthened procurement and transportation preparations, replenished procurement forces and transportation tools, and organized a group of procurement personnel to go deep into the communes and teams to procure. The more than 5,000 people organized by the Lu'an Special District went to the people's communes and production teams to help the masses fight drought on the one hand, and organize the masses to sell non-staple foods such as live pigs, fresh fish, and poultry on the other. In the entire special district, the procurement volume of pigs in mid-August increased by 88% compared to the first ten days of the month, fish increased by 100%, and poultry increased by more than tenfold. After procuring large quantities of pigs, fresh fish, and poultry, all localities promptly transported them out to support the needs of the people in cities and industrial and mining areas.

From our newspaper in Hefei, 13th: The commercial departments of Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, started by helping people's communes solve specific problems in production, promoting the development of non-staple food production in the communes, and ensuring the completion of procurement tasks. From January to the present, the county has procured a total of 32,251 live pigs, 2,567,700 catties of fresh eggs, and 65,296 poultry. This county has been leading the province in completing the state's procurement and outward transfer plans for live pigs, fresh eggs, and poultry, and has become a red banner in the province's commercial system.

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the commercial departments of Huoqiu County made full use of the favorable conditions after communization, brought into play the energy and ingenuity of the staff, and took various effective measures to vigorously grasp the procurement of non-staple foods. They cooperated with the agricultural departments to run live pig epidemic prevention and fattening training groups, helping communes train more than 580 technicians, supplying 365 pieces of fattening equipment, and 2,000 doses of traditional Chinese medicine for epidemic prevention and fattening. The commercial departments also ran 58 pig farms and fattening farms on their own to accelerate the breeding of piglets.

In order to support the communes in developing livestock and poultry production, the commercial departments of Huoqiu County, in addition to helping the communes establish hatcheries and pig farms, and solving problems such as technicians, also timely transferred 3,052 breeding chickens, purchased more than 220,000 catties of breeding eggs, and supplied them to the communes.

Thanks to the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels and the active assistance of commercial departments, the production of non-staple foods in Huoqiu County has developed rapidly. At present, the county has raised 381,436 pigs, an increase of 2.18 times compared to the beginning of the year, with an average of 2.2 pigs per household; the number of poultry has increased to 3,966,063, an increase of 5.05 times compared to the beginning of the year, with an average of four per person. The county has basically achieved "every household raises pigs, every family raises chickens, and every team has a breeding farm." (Ji Hede)
