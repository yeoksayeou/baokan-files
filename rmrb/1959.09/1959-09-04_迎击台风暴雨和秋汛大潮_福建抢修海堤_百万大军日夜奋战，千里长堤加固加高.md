Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd – After overcoming two strong typhoons and rainstorms, party, government, military, and civilians in coastal areas of Fujian Province continue to fight day and night on the seawall lines, rushing to repair and reinforce the dikes to combat the upcoming lunar August tides.

Fujian Province has more than 1,800 kilometers of coastal dikes, safeguarding the lives and property of millions of residents in 22 counties and cities. To combat the autumn typhoons, rainstorms, and autumn flood tides, and to protect the lives and property of millions of coastal residents, since the end of August, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Fujian Provincial People's Committee jointly established a disaster relief and flood control headquarters. They have repeatedly issued instructions and held emergency meetings, promptly mobilizing and organizing forces from all aspects. On one hand, they directed the overcoming of the two strong typhoons and rainstorms of August 23rd and 30th. On the other hand, they organized a million-strong army for autumn flood control, working day and night under the leadership of disaster relief and flood control headquarters at all levels, rushing to repair and reinforce the dikes to ensure victory over the two autumn flood tides around September 5th and 20th. Coastal counties in the Fu'an, Minhou, Jinjiang, and other regions, after days and nights of intensive repairs by hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians, have so far successively reinforced, heightened, and thickened more than 460 kilometers of seawalls. The coastal counties and people's communes in the Longxi area, where more than 150 kilometers of dikes were damaged by the typhoon and rainstorm of August 23rd, have been rushing to repair them with the support of a large number of manpower, materials, and equipment from other communes and counties. Most of them have now been repaired, and the remaining 400,000 cubic meters of work will also be strived to be completed before the arrival of the autumn flood tide.

During the all-out rush to repair the seawalls, party and government leaders at all levels personally went to the front lines to participate in the repairs and direct the battle, promptly discovering and solving problems in dike repair and flood control, which powerfully inspired the enthusiasm of the dike repair and flood control army and accelerated the speed of dike repair. More than 54,000 flood control and rescue personnel in Putian County, under the personal leadership of the Secretary of the Putian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the secretaries of the commune party committees and other party and government leaders, went to the dike defense lines and rushed to repair more than 400 dangerous seawall sections in one day, and heightened and thickened more than 50 kilometers of seawalls, accounting for about one-third of the total length of the seawalls. More than 10,000 flood control personnel in Yacheng Commune, Xiapu County, also held a mobilization meeting at the construction site, enthusiastically carrying out a red flag competition and a tool reform movement, which increased the efficiency of earth transportation and other work by four or five times, shortened the original plan by half the time, and rushed to complete the task of reinforcing and consolidating 12.25 kilometers of seawall.

In the repair of seawalls, the superiority of the people's communes was fully utilized in various places, so that if one commune had difficulties, all communes came to support, and if one team had difficulties, all teams came to support, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient labor and equipment, and greatly accelerating the speed of repair. Ten inland brigades in Dongshi Commune, Jinjiang County, drew 3,100 laborers to support the three coastal brigades with insufficient labor, and repaired six kilometers of seawall, generally raising it by more than half a meter. Because of the lack of labor in the coastal Zhongmen and Hanjiang communes in Putian County, it was difficult to repair the seawalls before the typhoon arrived. The nearby Hushih Commune immediately transferred more than 5,000 laborers overnight to help with the rush repairs. As a result, the seawalls were repaired before the typhoon arrived, ensuring the safety of the people's lives and property. The four communes of Dianxia, Diantou, etc. in Fuding County organized large-scale battles, rushing to repair 83 seawall sections in four days. After the repairs, more than 600 people were organized to patrol and protect the dikes to ensure safe passage through the high tide. The commune-run industry of Lianhua Commune in Haicheng County rushed to make a large number of dike repair tools and rain-proof tools for the commune. A large number of sacks were also transferred between the brigades, solving the shortage of equipment in dike repair, and increasing the dike repair efficiency from an average of one cubic meter per day to 1.6 cubic meters.

During the repair of seawalls, the inland regions and counties, as well as industrial, commercial, and transportation departments at all levels, also tried every means to transport materials and equipment to support the coastal people in their rush to repair seawalls and fight floods.

    迎击台风暴雨和秋汛大潮
    福建抢修海堤
    百万大军日夜奋战，千里长堤加固加高
    新华社福州3日电　福建省沿海各地党政军民在战胜两次强台风和暴雨袭击后，继续日夜奋战在海堤线上，突击抢修和加固堤防，迎击即将到来的农历八月大潮。
    福建省沿海堤防长达一千八百多公里，捍卫着二十二个县市数百万居民生命财产的安全。为了战胜秋季台风暴雨和秋汛大潮的袭击，保护沿海数百万居民生命财产，从
  8月下旬以来，中共福建省委和福建省人民委员会，即联合成立抗灾防汛指挥部，并多次发出指示和召开紧急会议，及时动员和组织各方面力量，一面指挥战胜了8月23日和30日两次强台风和暴雨的袭击，一面又组织了一支百万人的秋季防汛大军，日夜在各级抗灾防汛指挥部领导下，突击抢修和加固堤防，以保证战胜9月5日和20日前后两次秋汛大潮的袭击。福安、闽侯、晋江等地区沿海各县，经过数十万军民日夜突击抢修，到目前止，共计先后加固和加高培厚海堤四百六十多公里。被8月23日台风暴雨冲坏堤防一百五十多公里的龙溪专区沿海各县和各人民公社，在其他公社和县市抽调大批人力物资和器材支援下，突击抢修，现在大部分修复，尚差四十多万立方米工程也力争在秋汛大潮到来前全部完成。
    在全面突击抢修海堤中，各级党政领导干部都亲临前线参加抢修和指挥战斗，及时发现和解决修堤防汛中的问题，有力地鼓舞了修堤防汛大军的干劲，加快了抢修堤防的速度。莆田县五万四千多名防汛抢险大军，在中共莆田县委书记和公社党委书记等党政领导干部亲自领导下，分赴堤防战线，在一天当中就突击抢修了险工海堤四百多处，加高培厚海堤五十多公里，占海堤总长三分之一左右。霞浦县牙城公社一万多防汛大军，还在工地上举行了誓师大会，热烈开展夺红旗竞赛和工具改革运动，使运土等工效提高四、五倍，比原订计划缩短一半时间，突击完成十二点二五公里海堤的培修加固任务。
    在抢修海堤中各地充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，做到一社有困难社社来支援，一队有困难队队来支援，克服了劳力器材等不足的困难，大大加快了抢修速度。晋江县东石公社的内地十个大队，抽出三千一百多个劳力，支援劳力不足的三个沿海大队，抢修了海堤六公里，普遍加高半米以上。莆田县靠海忠门、涵江两个公社因劳力不足，在台风到来前修好海堤有困难，附近的笏石公社即连夜抽调了五千多个劳力去帮助抢修，结果在台风到来前修好了海堤，保证了人民生命财产的安全。福鼎县店下、点头等四个公社组织大兵团作战，四天中突击抢修八十三处海堤，抢修后并组织六百多个人巡逻护堤，保证安度大潮。海澄县莲花公社社办工业为公社赶制大批修堤工具和抗雨工具。各大队之间也互相调剂大批麻袋，解决了修堤中器材不足困难，并使修堤效率由原来每天平均一立方米增加到一点六立方米。
    在抢修海堤中，各内地专区和县份以及各级工业商业交通运输部门，也都千方百计地调运物资器材，支援沿海人民抢修海堤和防汛斗争。
