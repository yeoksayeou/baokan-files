Cableway Flies Across White Clouds
By Our Correspondent Zhang Shengbin

Have you seen Guangmu? Have you been to Guangmu's hometown? This top-brand fir, renowned both domestically and internationally, is produced in the Huitong forest area of Hunan. It is not only round and free of knots, with a tough texture, but also thick and long, with large ones having a girth of over four feet and a length of over ten zhang. This kind of wood has been to many countries and is a pillar of our country's industrial construction. When you see it, have you ever thought about how the forestry workers transport it out?

In those high mountains and steep ridges, on narrow and steep forest paths, if you walk alone, you will feel unsteady, and you may slip and fall if you are not careful. But the forest transport workers used to walk on these rugged and dangerous roads year after year, sweating profusely and suffering many frights, carrying heavy and long logs one by one from the top of the mountain over the ridges to the slopes, and from the bottom of the slopes to the streamside, and then transporting the wood out through the flow of the stream. What a difficult and arduous task it was! In the past, the forest transport workers sang such a mountain song:

"Transporting wood is difficult, transporting wood is difficult, crossing ridges and walking along the box is frightening. (Note 1)
Broken shoulder skin is nothing, a misstep means meeting the King of Hell."

Today's forest area is not the same as it used to be. On the undulating mountain peaks, aerial double-line cableways have been erected everywhere. When this log is hooked onto the cableway and released, another hook automatically rushes up to hook the second log, going back and forth, like shooting stars, sending the bulky wood to the low mountains and steep slopes. Connected to the mountain slopes are suspended bamboo roller slide ways. The wood comes down from the cableway and gets on the slide way, flying straight down the slope like an arrow, directly onto the flat wooden railcars below. Whenever the wood slides down the slope, it is directly loaded onto the flatcar frame, and like a train, transports the wood smoothly to the stream, pushing it into the river (Note 2) to float downstream. It is not only safe and fast, but also flexible and convenient. With just a few people operating, the wood flies in the direction indicated by people, and the workers no longer have to worry about climbing rocks and taking risks.

Zhang Zixin, a comrade from the Huitong County Forestry Bureau, told me that the forest area has now basically realized semi-mechanization of mountain transportation, with 243 various cableways, slide ways, and flatcar tracks, with a total length of 469 li. The general work efficiency is more than ten times higher than manual carrying.

How was the semi-mechanization of mountain transportation born and developed? During the Great Leap Forward last year, the timber production tasks in the forest area increased several times. With heavy transportation tasks and rugged roads, how to quickly transport the timber to various construction sites was a matter of great concern to the forest transport workers. Some people advocated completing the task by working hard desperately; some advocated reducing the targets; and some advocated guaranteeing the completion of the task by working skillfully. In the event of differences of opinion, a democratic movement of great debates was launched in the forest area. Conservative ideas were criticized, and the enthusiasm of the workers soared, with the powerful battle cry of "Open up dangerous mountain roads, clear shallow and dry riverbeds, and clear the way for timber!" resounding throughout the forest.

The leading cadres of the Huitong County Party Committee and the higher forestry departments all went to the transportation front line to offer suggestions and help workers find solutions. Tian Min, deputy director of the Qianyang Prefectural Forestry Bureau, also personally came to the forest area to take the lead in the mountain cableway transportation experiment, which further aroused the enthusiasm of the workers to carry out technical revolution. Duan Guiwen, the leader of the work team of the Xiaoshi Logging Farm, after hearing about the cableway transportation, rushed to the construction site overnight, mobilized the workers to boldly create, replaced steel cables with nan bamboo, replaced iron hooks with wooden hooks, and erected the first single-line earthen cableway. Because the bamboo and wood structure could not withstand the impact of the wood, the cableway broke. They then adopted the method of thickening the bamboo pieces and cross-connecting them to continue the experiment, and finally succeeded. After the news spread, the workers of the Lianshan Logging Farm rose up and created a double-line round-trip cableway collectively in five days and five nights. Immediately afterwards, Zhang Wanhong of the Shuxikou Forest Farm created a bamboo and wood structured roller slide way. At this time, forestry departments from all over the province and delegations from Fujian, Guizhou and other provinces came to the forest area to observe and learn.

Advanced tools were popularized in the forest area, and a magnificent technical revolution wave impacted everyone's heart. Wu Qinglu, a 21-year-old youth and a shock brigade member of the Guangping Commune Forestry Production Satellite Regiment, saw that others had inventions and creations, and the transportation efficiency had jumped dozens of times. He felt that the wooden railcar he was using was too bulky, slow, and heavy to return, and it took two people to push it with all their might. He secretly designed a light and clever flatcar. The trial run was much lighter, and one person could push it back. However, when loaded with wood, the wheels moved very slowly. It took thirty minutes to travel a distance of 700 meters. Later, he created a method of installing old nan bamboo tubes inside the rollers to replace ball bearings, which accelerated the driving speed. The distance of 700 meters could be reached in only four minutes.

From last year to now, the wave of technical revolution in the forest area has never calmed down. After the drought occurred in July this year, the rivers in the forest area dried up, and more than 500,000 logs were stranded on the small river beaches. The vast number of workers were in high spirits, working hard and skillfully. On the seven small streams transporting wood in the entire forest area, they adopted the method of building dams at every beach and blocking water to concentrate the flow, blocking the diverted small streams into the main stream, raising the water level, and dredging more than 110 li of shallow and dry waterways in eight days and nights, so that the timber was unobstructed. On the dangerous shoals of the big river, they used the method of digging channels in the sand and widening the straits to dredge more than 180 li of waterways. With the dredging of streams and rivers, the wood releasing was also undergoing comprehensive technical innovation: on small streams and shallow water, they used the method of releasing wood to accelerate the flow; on the big river, they used the method of multi-section single rows to fly over the dangerous shoals, so that the timber was continuously transported to the timber collection base.

Now although it is the dry season in autumn, the Huitong forest area is full of spring water and silver light. Dense logs on the small stream basin flow down the stream, which people call "intensive sheep herding" flow; once it enters the big river, these logs become multi-section connected rows, like a "long dragon" coming out of the water, flying over the waves. This is the leap forward road pioneered by the heroes on the forest transport front with their own genius and wisdom, through which batches of high-quality timber from the forest area are transported to all parts of the motherland. Taking this year's output of more than 280,000 cubic meters of timber as an example, if it is used as sleepers, the national railway can be extended by 2,215 kilometers; if it is used to build a factory of 1,000 square meters, 2,618 factories can be added. What a great contribution this is!

Note 1: "Walking the box" The wooden frame erected in the air on a steep slope is called the box road. The workers carry the wood down the slope from this single wooden frame is called walking the box.
Note 2: Pushing the river: Forest area people call pushing the wood from the stream to the river "pushing the river".

    索道飞架白云间
    本报记者　张胜斌
    你见过广木吗？到过广木的故乡吗？这个在国内外久享盛名的王牌杉木，出产在湖南会同林区。它不仅圆满无节、材质坚韧；而且又粗又长，大的围径有四尺多粗、十丈多长。这种木材到过许多国家，是我国工业建设上的栋梁之材。当你看到它的时候，可曾想到林区工人是怎样把它运出来的么？
    在那高山峻岭，路窄坡陡的林区山道上，如果单人空行，你会感到站不住脚跟，不小心就有滑倒的危险。可是林区的运输工人们，他们就曾经年奔走在这些崎岖的险道上，不知流了多少汗水，饱受过多少虚惊，把一根一根笨重粗长的木材，从山头搬过山岭抬到坡上，又从坡下抬到溪边，再通过溪水的流送，才能运出木材。那是多么艰巨而繁重的工作啊！过去林区运输工人唱过这样一首山歌：
    “运木难，运木难，翻岭走箱肝胆寒。（注1）
    肩肿皮破不要紧，失脚一命见阎王。”
    今天的林区却不是昔日的景象了。在那群峰起伏的山头上，到处架起了双线临空的索道，当这根木头套上索道的挂钩放出之后，另一个挂钩又自动赶上来接套第二根木头，往返来回，就像流星一样，把粗笨的木材送到低山陡坡上；紧接山坡而下的是悬空架起的竹筒滚龙滑道，木头从索道上下来，就搭上了滑道，像离弦之箭，直飞坡下，联接坡下的又是木轨平车，每当滑木下坡，就直接装到平车架上，像列车一样，把木材顺到溪边，推河（注2）顺水而下。不仅安全迅速，而且灵巧轻便，只要几个人操作，木材就按照人们指引的方向飞去，工人们再也没有攀岩走险之忧了。
    会同县林业局的张自新同志告诉我：现在林区已经基本实现了山地运输土机械化，拥有各种索道、滑道、平车道二百四十三条，全长四百六十九华里，一般工效比肩运提高十倍以上。
    山地运输土机械化是怎样诞生和发展起来的呢？去年大跃进的日子里，林区木材生产任务成倍增加，在运输任务重，道路岖险的情况下，如何使木材迅速地运往各个建筑工地，这是林区运输工人异常焦虑的问题。有的人主张用拼命苦干的办法来完成任务；有的人主张压缩指标；也有的人主张用巧干活干的办法来保证任务完成。在意见分歧的情况下，林区掀起了一场大鸣大放大辩论的民主运动，保守思想受到了批判，广大职工干劲冲天，森林里响彻了：“劈开山头险道，打通枯水浅滩，为木材鸣锣开道”的气势磅礴的战斗口号。
    中共会同县委和上级林业部门的领导干部，都深入到运输前线，为工人出主意想办法，黔阳专署林业局副局长田民，也亲自来到林区带头搞山头索道运输试验，更加激起了广大职工大搞技术革命的热潮。小市伐木场的工作组长段贵文，打听到索道运输的消息后，连夜赶到工地，发动工人大胆创造，用楠竹代替钢索，用木挂代替铁钩，架起了第一根单线土索道；由于竹木结构经不起木材的冲击，索道断了，他们又采用加厚竹片、交叉衔接的办法，继续试验，终于试验成功了。消息传出之后，涟山伐木场职工奋起直追，在五天五夜之内，集体创造了双线来回索道。紧接着疏溪口林场的张万宏又创造了竹木结构的滚龙滑道。这时候，全省各地林业部门和福建、贵州等省都派代表团来到林区观摩、学习。
    先进工具在林区推广开了，一场波澜壮阔的技术革命高潮冲击着每个人的心。广坪公社林业生产卫星团的突击队员、二十一岁的青年吴情禄看到别人都有创造发明，运输工效一跃提高几十倍，他感到自己用的一辆木轨平车太笨重，走得慢，回车重，两人推的满身大汗。他暗地设计了一架轻巧的平车，试车结果，轻便得多，回车时只要一个人就能推着跑。但是装上木材，车轮运输很慢，七百米长的距离，要三十分钟才能到达。后来他创造了在滚轮内装上老楠竹筒，代替滚珠轴承的办法，加快了行车速度，七百米的距离只用四分钟就能到达。
    从去年到现在，林区技术革命的浪涛，一直没有平静。今年7月，干旱发生之后，林区河干水枯，五十多万根木材，又搁浅在小溪河滩上面。广大职工意气风发，苦干、巧干，在全林区七条流运木材的小溪上采用逢滩作坝、堵水归溶的办法，把岔溶小水堵入正溶，提高水位，八个昼夜，疏通枯水浅道一百一十多里，使木材畅通无阻；在大河枯水险滩上，他们用沙滩掏溶、炸宽夹道的办法，疏通了一百八十余里的渠水。随着溪河疏通，放木也进行全面的技术革新：在小溪浅水上，他们用放木的办法，加速流运；在大河上，则用多节单排的办法，飞越滩险，使木材源源运往集材基地。
    现在虽然是秋水枯燥季节，可是会同林区却是春水盈盈，银光闪闪。小溪流域上密集的木材，顺着溪流，滚滚而下，人们叫它“密集式赶羊”流运；一进大河，这些木材就变成了多节联排，像出水“长龙”，乘风破浪地飞跃着。这就是奔走在林区运输战线上的英雄们用自己的天才和智慧，开拓出来的跃进之路，通过它，把林区成批的优质木材运到祖国各地。单以今年的输出木材二十八万多立方米来说，如果用它作枕木，全国铁路就可延长二千二百一十五公里；如果用它建筑一千平方米的厂房，就可增加二千六百一十八个工厂。这是一个多么大的贡献啊！
    注1：“走箱”陡坡上悬空竖起的木架叫箱道，运木工人从这独木架抬木下坡叫走箱。
    注2：推河：林区人们把木头从溪边推到河中，称作“推河”。
