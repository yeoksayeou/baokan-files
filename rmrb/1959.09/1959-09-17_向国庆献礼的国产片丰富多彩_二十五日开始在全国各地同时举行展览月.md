A Variety of Domestic Films Dedicated to the National Day
Exhibition Month to be Held Simultaneously Across the Country Starting on the 25th

    This newspaper reports: The "National Day Tenth Anniversary Domestic New Film Exhibition Month," marking an unprecedented bumper harvest in China's film industry, will be held from September 25th to October 24th in the capitals and major cities of 27 provinces and autonomous regions across the country. It will also be held simultaneously in industrial, mining, and rural areas nationwide. The vast audience will be able to see the most outstanding films dedicated to the tenth anniversary of National Day by various film studios.
    During the Exhibition Month, more than ten large feature films and more than ten documentaries, science education films, and animated films, all in color, will be screened in 27 cities. The themes of the films are very broad, with diverse styles and content covering ancient and modern China and foreign countries, and all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military. Whether in terms of ideology or artistry, these films are of a higher quality than any previous Chinese films, reaching a considerably excellent level. This fact demonstrates the great victory achieved by China's film industry in implementing the policy of putting politics in command, walking on two legs, and letting a hundred flowers bloom.
    The more than ten domestic color feature films to be screened in the 27 cities include: "Lin Zexu" (produced by Shanghai Haiyan Film Studio), reflecting Lin Zexu's prohibition of opium and resistance against British imperialism; "The Story of a Veteran Soldier" (produced by Haiyan Film Studio), depicting the heroic figures who reclaimed wasteland; "Young People in Our Village" (produced by Changchun Film Studio), reflecting the daring and enterprising youth in the rural Great Leap Forward; "The Lin Family Shop" (produced by Beijing Film Studio), adapted from Mao Dun's original work; "The Storm" (produced by Beijing Film Studio), reflecting the historical facts of the February 7th Strike; "Song of Youth" (produced by Beijing Film Studio), adapted from Yang Mo's novel "Song of Youth"; "Thousands of Rivers, Thousands of Mountains" (formerly "Long Live the Red Army," co-produced by August First Film Studio and Beijing Film Studio), depicting heroic deeds during the 25,000-li Long March; "Flowers Meet Spring Rain" (produced by Changchun Film Studio), reflecting the mental outlook of housewives in the Great Leap Forward; the children's story film "Good Children" (produced by Haiyan Film Studio); "The Hui Muslim Detachment" (produced by August First Film Studio), depicting a Hui Muslim volunteer anti-Japanese team that spontaneously formed during the Anti-Japanese War and transformed into a revolutionary army under the leadership of the Party; the stage art film "Lotus Lantern" (produced by Shanghai Tianma Film Studio), based on the national dance drama; "Oasis Triumphant Song" (produced by Haiyan Film Studio and Xinjiang Film Studio), depicting the Uyghur people of Xinjiang resolutely taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party; the sports story film "Two Sisters on Ice" (produced by Changchun Film Studio); and the Sino-Soviet co-production "Wind from the East" (co-produced by the Soviet Union and Changchun Film Studio).
    The documentaries include the large-scale color documentary "Heroes Conquer the Great Northern Wilderness" (filmed by August First Film Studio), recording the reclamation of wasteland and struggle against nature by demobilized and transferred soldiers; the large-scale color documentary "Green Wilderness" (produced by August First Film Studio), recording the establishment of new farms on the grassland by a production army composed of thirteen ethnic groups on the banks of the Ili River in Xinjiang; the large-scale documentary "The Tenth Spring" (filmed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio), showing the great achievements made by the motherland in various fields over the past ten years; short documentaries include "Clay Figure Zhang," "Red Light Shines on Mountain Villages," "Expedition to the Desert," and "Locking the Yellow Dragon" (all produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio); science education films include: the Sino-Soviet co-production "In the Dense Forest of Xishuangbanna" (formerly "The Path in the Dense Forest," co-produced by the Soviet Union and August First Film Studio); "Peking Man" (produced by Shanghai Science Education Film Studio); "Let the Earth Be Landscaped" (filmed by August First Film Studio); Animated film compilation: including the animated film "Little Carp Leaps Over the Dragon Gate", "The Radish is Back" paper-cut film "Fisher Boy", puppet film "The Dragon Carving Record" (all produced by Shanghai Animation Film Studio).
    The films exhibited this time reflect major historical themes, timely reflect real life, create some vivid artistic images, and create various artistic styles, showing that the ideology and artistry of domestic films have greatly improved over the past year. Moreover, from the three color widescreen stereophonic feature films "The Story of a Veteran Soldier," "Thousands of Rivers, Thousands of Mountains," and "Wind from the East," and the color films such as "Lin Zexu," it can be seen that China's film photography, recording, art, special effects, and makeup have all made great progress. Recently, following the successful experimental screening of panoramic films, the filming of panoramic films documenting the National Games has begun. This shows that China's film technology is moving towards a higher level.
    The program for this Domestic New Film Exhibition Month has been printed with more than 600 color 35mm copies for major cities to screen during the Exhibition Month. At the same time, more than 1,700 16mm color copies of the four feature films "Lin Zexu," "The Story of a Veteran Soldier," "Young People in Our Village," and "Animated Film Compilation" will be printed to supply large-scale screenings in rural areas, factories, and mines.
    Furthermore, during the "Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of National Day Domestic New Film Exhibition Month," Beijing will screen three more excellent new domestic films than other places, in addition to the ten feature films and ten documentaries, science education films, and animated films. These are "Spring is All Over the World" filmed by Tianma Film Studio, which depicts the story of medical personnel creating miracles to rescue severely burned steelworkers under the leadership of the Party; and "Nie Er" filmed by Haiyan Film Studio, which depicts the growth and revolutionary musical activities of the revolutionary musician Nie Er. There is also "Five Golden Flowers" filmed by Changchun Film Studio, which reflects the happy life of ethnic minorities.
    In addition, more than thirty foreign films will be shown in Beijing in October, including the Soviet films "Steppe Fire," "Thunderstorm on the Field," "On the Tisa River," and "Destruction," the German film "Sailor's Song," the Mongolian film "Spark," the Hungarian film "Yesterday," and the Korean film "Only One Road."

    本报讯　标志着我国电影事业获得空前大丰收的“庆祝国庆十周年国产新片展览月”，将从9月25日起到10月24日，在全国二十七个省、自治区首府和大城市举行。在全国工矿农村也同时举行。广大观众将可以看到各个电影制片厂为国庆十周年献礼的最优秀的影片。

    在二十七个城市上映的十余部国产彩色故事片中有：反映林则徐禁止鸦片抗击英帝国主义的影片“林则徐”（上海海燕电影厂出品）；描写开垦荒地的英雄人物的“老兵新传”（海燕电影厂出品）；反映农村大跃进中敢想敢干的青年的影片“我们村里的年轻人”（长春电影厂出品）；根据茅盾原作改编的电影“林家铺子”（北京电影厂出品）；反映二七大罢工斗争史实的影片“风暴”（北京电影厂出品）；根据杨沫小说“青春之歌”改编的电影“青春之歌”（北京电影厂出品）；描写二万五千里长征中英雄事迹的“万水千山”（原名“红军万岁”，八一电影厂与北京电影厂合拍）；反映家庭妇女大跃进中的精神面貌的影片“花逢春雨”（长春电影厂出品）；儿童故事片“好孩子”（海燕电影厂出品）；描写抗日战争中一支回民自发组成的抗日义勇队，在党的领导下变成革命军队的影片“回民支队”（八一电影制片厂出品）；根据民族舞剧拍摄的舞台艺术片“宝莲灯”（上海天马电影厂出品）；描写新疆维吾尔族人民，在党领导下坚决走社会主义道路的影片“绿洲凯歌”（海燕电影厂与新疆电影厂出品）；体育故事片“冰上两姊妹”（长春电影厂出品）；中苏合拍故事片“风从东方来”（苏联和长春电影厂合拍）。
