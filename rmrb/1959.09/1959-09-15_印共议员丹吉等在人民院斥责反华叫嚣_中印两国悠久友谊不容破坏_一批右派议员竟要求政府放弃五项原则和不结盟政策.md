Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 13th: The Indian Parliament's People's House (lower house) adjourned on the 12th after a five-hour debate on the Sino-Indian border issue and is expected to reconvene in mid-November. The meeting passed a resolution expressing agreement with the Indian "government's policy regarding the border issue existing between the Indian government and the Chinese government, and agreeing with its views and position on this issue."

At the meeting on the 12th, a group of right-wing MPs continued to clamor and slander China for "aggression," openly demanding that the Indian government abandon its non-aligned policy, not establish relations with China on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and even prevent the Indian people from saying "Indians and Chinese are brothers."

At the beginning of the debate, Deo of the Democratic Congress Party attacked Premier Zhou Enlai's letter as a "ridiculous trick." He insisted that China had invaded India and threatened Sikkim and Bhutan. He said, "China should be told that aggression will be resisted, and India has the strong support of Western countries." He said that the Sino-Indian border should have been "resolutely demarcated" in 1954 when the agreement on Tibet was signed with China.

Kripalani, the leader of the Praja Socialist Party, slandered China for implementing "autocratic rule" and said, "We must not forget China's inherent aggressiveness." He openly stated that India "lost a buffer state" after the Tibetan rebellion was quelled, and he expressed "regret" about this. He then falsely accused that "China's totalitarian regime is implementing imperialist policies in Tibet" and is "marching towards our borders." He said, "Only after clearing the aggression on our borders can we consider negotiations on the basis of the McMahon Line." He also said, "It is a tragedy that our people are still repeating the slogan 'Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai' (Indians and Chinese are brothers)."

Congress Party MP Ra. Su. Singh insisted that the Indian government send planes to bomb Longju or places he believed were "occupied" by Chinese troops.

Socialist Party MP B. Singh openly clamored that holding demonstrations in front of the Chinese Consulate in Bombay and insulting Chairman Mao's portrait was the "right of the people."

Kripalani and others also blatantly demanded that Nehru change his non-aligned policy in their speeches. Kripalani clamored for "considering appropriate strategies and tactics." Socialist Party MP B. Singh demanded a change in his so-called policy of "appeasement towards China." Raja Karni Singh of Bikaner also asked the Indian government to change its foreign policy and make friends with certain countries so that India "would not be isolated when facing the danger from China."

Congress Party MPs Joachim Alva, G. Das, and Communist MP Dange, as well as several other MPs, firmly advocated maintaining the non-aligned policy and the policy of Sino-Indian friendship. Alva refuted the warmongering clamor against China and said that the long-standing friendship between China and India must not be sabotaged. He criticized some people's hope to establish close cooperation with Pakistan.

Dange said, "Our problem is not a relationship between two mutually hostile countries, but a relationship between two countries that are actually friends and have concluded a treaty of friendship."

He vehemently criticized the war hysteria stirred up over the Sino-Indian border issue. He said that this practice was a "deliberate political tactic of reactionary forces who want to destroy Panchsheel, plunge India and China into war, implement military rule and declare the Communist Party illegal domestically." He condemned the conspiracy to suppress Indian Communists by taking advantage of the border issue.

Dange also pointed out that India has the right to grant asylum to anyone, but the Dalai Lama is using Indian territory to conduct activities, raising the Tibet issue with the United Nations, and saying that "China is eliminating the Tibetan race." When Dange said this, Kripalani interrupted him, saying that "India is a free country, and everyone here can freely express his views." Dange said, "Is it right for a free country to allow another person or group of people to call themselves a government and promote a war against another country in order to drag this country in?"
Nehru delivered a speech lasting fifty minutes at the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution after Nehru's speech.

    印共议员丹吉等在人民院斥责反华叫嚣
    中印两国悠久友谊不容破坏
    一批右派议员竟要求政府放弃五项原则和不结盟政策
    据新华社新德里13日电　印度议会人民院（下院）在12日就中印边界问题举行了五个小时的辩论以后宣告休会，预计到11月中复会。会议通过一项决议，表示同意印度“政府采取的关于印度政府和中国政府之间存在的边界问题的政策，并且同意它在这个问题上的观点和立场”。
    在12日的会议上，一批右派议员继续大叫大嚷地诽谤中国“侵略”，公开要求印度政府放弃不结盟政策，不要同中国在五项原则基础上建立关系，甚至不让印度人民再说“印中人民是兄弟”这句话。
    民主大会党的德奥在辩论一开始时，就攻击周恩来总理的信是“荒诞的把戏”。他硬说中国侵犯了印度，并且威胁锡金和不丹。他说，“应该告诉中国，侵略将会遭到抵抗，印度有西方国家的强大的支持。”他说，中印边界本应在1954年同中国签订有关西藏的协定时“断然划定”。
    人民社会党头子克里帕拉尼诽谤中国实行“专制统治”，并且说，“我们必须不忘记中国的天生的侵略性”。他公然表示西藏叛乱被平息后印度“丧失了缓冲国”，他对此表示“遗憾”，接着就诬蔑说什么“中国的极权政权在西藏实行帝国主义政策”，并且“向我们的边境进军”。他说，“只有肃清了对我们边境的侵略以后，我们才能考虑在麦克马洪线的基础上进行谈判。”他又说，“我国人民仍然重复着印地秦尼巴依巴依（印中人民是兄弟）这种口号，这是一种悲剧。”
    国大党议员拉·苏·辛格坚持要印度政府派飞机轰炸朗久或者他认为被中国军队“占领”的地方。
    社会党议员布·辛格公然叫嚷说，在孟买中国领事馆前举行示威和侮辱毛主席画像，是“人民的权利”。
    克里帕拉尼等人在发言中还露骨地要求尼赫鲁改变不结盟政策。克里帕拉尼叫嚷要“考虑适当的战略战术”。社会党议员布·辛格要求改变他所谓的“对中国姑息”的政策。比加尼尔土邦土王卡·辛格也要求印度政府改变外交政策，同某些国家交朋友，以便使印度“面对中国的危险时不致陷于孤立”。
    国大党议员乔·阿尔瓦、戈·达斯和共产党议员丹吉以及另外几个议员坚决主张维护不结盟政策和中印友好的政策。阿尔瓦驳斥了针对中国发出的好战叫嚣，并且说，中印两国之间悠久的友谊不容破坏。他抨击某些人希望同巴基斯坦建立密切合作。
    丹吉说，“我们的问题并不是两个互相敌视的国家之间的关系问题，这是实际上是朋友而且缔结了友好协定的两个国家之间的问题。”
    他猛烈抨击在中印边境问题上掀起战争歇斯底里的行为。他说，这种做法是“反动势力的处心积虑的政治策略，他们想搞垮潘查希拉，使印度和中国陷入战争，在国内实行军事统治和宣布共产党非法”。他谴责利用边境问题对印度共产党人实行镇压的阴谋。
    丹吉还指出，印度有权给任何人以避难权，但是，达赖喇嘛却利用印度领土进行活动，向联合国提出西藏问题，说什么“中国正在消灭西藏种族”。当丹吉这样说的时候，克里帕拉尼打断他的话，说什么“印度是一个自由国家，这里每一个人可以自由表示他的看法”。丹吉说，“难道自由国家准许另外一个人或一群人自称为政府，并且宣传对另外一个国家发动战争，以便把这个国家卷进去，这是正确的吗？”
    尼赫鲁在会上发表了长达五十分钟的讲话。会议在尼赫鲁讲话后通过了决议。
