Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Scientific workers in the capital warmly applaud the great victory of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket hitting the moon. More than 2,000 scientific workers from the Institute of Mechanics, the Institute of Automation, and the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the preparatory office of the Beijing Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, held celebration meetings today.

Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics, said at the meeting: The Soviet Union has hit the moon with its second cosmic rocket through accurate and complex automatic control. This is another big step forward for mankind in conquering outer space. We warmly celebrate the great achievements made by Soviet scientists and workers under the leadership of the Communist Party. He said: "Sending a rocket from Earth to the moon is a very complex process. Not only must there be orbital control, but also speed control. The most appropriate time must also be selected for launch. A little difference will make a great mistake. From the communique issued by the Soviet Union this time, it is already clear that the last stage of the rocket has control equipment. Only through automatic control and complex computer operation can it accurately hit the target. This proves that Soviet rockets have developed to the stage where they can hit any point they want." He excitedly said: Since rockets can hit the moon, they will inevitably be able to land on the moon, and they will inevitably be able to land on other planets. The day when humans travel in space is not far away.

Lu Yuanjiu, a researcher at the Institute of Automation, said at the meeting: The most noteworthy thing about the second cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union is not only the use of a speed exceeding the second cosmic velocity and an increase of 39 kilograms in weight, but also that the rocket's takeoff weight has increased by 40 tons or even 400 tons. Moreover, the last stage of this rocket is automatically controlled, and all the complex navigation equipment has been installed in this last stage of the rocket. This shows that the level of Soviet automatic control technology has greatly improved compared with the launch of the first cosmic rocket.

When the news of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reaching the moon reached the Institute of Mechanics, more than 600 staff members immediately gathered to celebrate. They expressed their joy and encouragement for the new achievements of the Soviet scientific community with long applause. Many researchers spoke, believing that the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reaching the moon indicates that Soviet scientific research has entered a newer stage. Associate Researcher Lin Tongji said: The last stage of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket has a controller, which is a major improvement in the rocket's structure. Researcher Li Minhua said: The Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket this time, and there are measurement stations everywhere to collect measurement data and observe orbital factors. From this, it can be seen that this rocket launch focuses on the orbit. From the situation of the Soviet Union's several rocket launches, it can also be seen that they each have a clear purpose, are planned, and are both progressive and leap-forward. The data measured by the Soviet Union—that is, the understanding of cosmic natural phenomena in the past and the accuracy of orbital control—is a major step towards interstellar navigation. Associate Researcher Lin Hongsun said: There are several new achievements worthy of attention in the rocket launched by the Soviet Union this time: 1. The moon orbits the Earth at one kilometer per second, and the rocket is also running at high speed. Without an accurate orbit, the two objects will miss each other; 2. When the rocket reaches the moon, the impact force is very large, and the relative speed to the moon is three kilometers per second. The fact that the rocket with the Soviet national emblem can reach the moon is a new achievement in terms of structure and speed control, which is conducive to solving the problem of safe landing of the rocket. Now that small objects can be sent to the moon, it is entirely possible to send larger objects, and even people, to the moon in the future; 3. When the rocket reaches the moon, it sends valuable information along the way, which serves as important data for human scientific research and paves the way for humans to fly to the moon; 4. The first Soviet cosmic rocket approached the orbit of Mars. Based on the speed of this rocket, it is entirely possible to reach Mars with a slight increase. In their speeches, the researchers also unanimously believed that the successful launch of this rocket by the Soviet Union once again demonstrated the strength of the socialist camp in defending peace, and once again proved that the East wind prevails over the West wind, demonstrating the incomparable superiority of the socialist system.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: After the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reached the surface of the moon, He Qingzhi and Zhao Zhenyan, associate professors of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, excitedly said to Xinhua News Agency reporters that from now on, there will be a human marker on the moon—the marker left by the Soviet cosmic rocket. This is a great event in human history and a great event for the socialist camp.

Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University and a mechanic, said that the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket was launched to the moon according to the planned plan, which shows the precision of the automatic control system and the accuracy of the calculation. The new achievements of the Soviet cosmic rocket have opened up a path for mankind from Earth to another celestial body, and opened a new page for the future development of cosmic rockets and the study of outer space.

This news caused a sensation throughout Beijing, and people from all walks of life in the city cheered and applauded this historically significant achievement. Zheng Tongsheng, a representative of the Beijing People's Congress and a worker at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, said: The Soviet Union has created an unprecedented achievement in history, which has further increased our confidence in accelerating socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 14th: People from all walks of life in Tianjin warmly applaud the new contribution made by the Soviet people to the conquest of outer space.

Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University and a physicist, said: The weight of the last section of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket is 39 kilograms heavier than the first one. The instruments carried by the rocket have also been increased, and the control and operation system has been improved. The successful launch of this rocket to the surface of the moon will undoubtedly obtain a lot of new and valuable data, thereby advancing the science of space flight a big step forward. At the same time, this is also a great contribution to the cause of human peace. It shows that the Soviet Union's scientific and technological level has left the imperialists far behind. The imperialist elements can only sigh at the sky and tremble in their hearts at this rocket. We Chinese scientists extend our heartfelt congratulations to Soviet scientists, and we must better learn from their spirit of working hard for science and peace.

Yang Shixian, Dean of the Hebei Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and President of Nankai University, said: The successful launch of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket to the surface of the moon shows that under the socialist system, scientific undertakings are developing at a flying pace, which is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. The series of brilliant achievements of Soviet scientists in conquering outer space has greatly strengthened the forces for maintaining world peace, and dealt another heavy blow to the imperialist conspiracy to continue the Cold War.

The workers of the Qi Zisheng steelmaking team of the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant were overjoyed when they heard the news that the Soviet cosmic rocket had reached the surface of the moon. Qi Zisheng happily said: The Soviet Union's scientific achievements are unparalleled in the world. We must advance by leaps and bounds and let the imperialists burst with anger.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 14th: The good news that the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket accurately flew to the surface of the moon, realizing the great ideal of mankind flying to another celestial body for the first time, has brought great joy and encouragement to people in Shanghai's scientific circles.

Zhou Ren, Vice President of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "The Soviet Union can accurately launch such a large rocket to the moon, which fully illustrates that the Soviet Union has reached a very high level in many cutting-edge scientific and technological fields such as electronics, computer technology, and automation."

Sun Hongjun, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications Administration, said: "The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket's victorious arrival at the Lunar Palace is another great contribution made by the Soviet Union, the strong fortress of the socialist camp, to mankind's conquest of the universe and the defense of world peace. This is another proof that the East wind is further prevailing over the West wind."

Wang Qi, Director Engineer of the Shanghai Radio Station Management Office, praised the Soviet Union's great achievement from the perspective of radio communications. He said: "The radio communication part of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket used ordinary high-frequency bands, which shows the superiority of Soviet radio telemetry and remote control technology."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 14th: After the news of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reaching the surface of the moon reached Nanjing, Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Zijinshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said to Xinhua News Agency reporters: This is another big step forward for mankind in conquering the universe. Mankind has never sent what they have created to another celestial body outside the Earth. It is already a remarkable achievement for explorers to plant the national flag in the inaccessible places of the North and South Poles. Now, sending something with the national emblem and text markers to the moon is much farther than the North and South Poles on the ground. Zhang Yuzhe said: Controlling the speed of the cosmic rocket so that it falls on the surface of the moon is more complicated than launching an artificial planet. After the rocket exceeds the second cosmic velocity, it can become an artificial planet. But if the rocket is to be attracted by the moon, its speed relative to the moon cannot be too great; but for the Earth, it must reach the second cosmic velocity so that it can break away from the influence of the Earth's gravity. The date of this rocket launch was chosen a few days after the first quarter moon, which was to use the Earth's rotation to reduce the relative speed of the rocket and the moon. Of course, accurate aiming and proper speed are equally important for reaching the moon.

Professor Dai Wensai, Deputy Director of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University, cheered the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in conquering outer space. He said: It is truly a historically significant event that mankind has launched an object created with its own wisdom to a celestial body outside the Earth for the first time. Dai Wensai said: The main significance of the successful launch of the first cosmic rocket is that it broke through the second cosmic velocity barrier, proving that it is possible for a man-made object to overcome the Earth's gravity and leave the Earth forever. The second cosmic rocket deliberately made it fall on the surface of the moon, thus paving the way for mankind to fly to the moon.

    红色火箭探月是人类历史大喜事
    我国科学家欢呼苏联宇宙火箭命中月球的伟大成就
    据新华社14日讯　首都科学工作者为苏联第二个宇宙火箭命中月球的伟大胜利热烈欢呼。中国科学院力学、自动化、地球物理三个研究所和中国科学院北京天文台筹备处的二千多名科学工作者，今天分别举行了庆祝大会。
    地球物理研究所所长赵九章在会上说：苏联把第二个宇宙火箭，通过准确而复杂的自动控制，已命中了月球，这是人类征服宇宙空间又向前迈进了一大步，我们热烈地庆祝苏联科学家、工人在共产党领导下获得的伟大成就。他说：“从地球把火箭打到月球是一个非常复杂的过程。不但要有轨道的控制，而且要有速度的控制，在发射时，还要选取最适当的时间，不能差一点，差了一点，就真是差以毫厘，谬以千里了。从这次苏联发布的公报，已经说明了最后一级火箭是有控制设备的，通过自动控制和复杂的计算机运转，才能准确地命中目标。这证明苏联火箭已经发展到要打中那一点就可以打中那一点的阶段了。”他兴奋地说：火箭既然可以命中月球，也必然可以在月球降落，也必然可以在其他星球上降落。人类遨游太空的日子已经不远了。
    自动化研究所研究员陆元久在大会上说：这次苏联发射的第二个宇宙火箭最为引人注意的不仅是用了超过第二宇宙速度和在重量上增加了三十九公斤，即火箭起飞重量增加了四十吨乃至四百吨。而且这支火箭的最后一级是自动控制的，所有复杂的导航设备已经装置在这最后一级火箭之中。这可以看出，苏联自动控制技术水平比发射第一支宇宙火箭已大大提高。
    苏联第二个宇宙火箭到达月球的消息传到力学研究所时，立即有六百多工作人员集会庆贺。他们用长时间的鼓掌表达他们对苏联科学界新成就的欢欣鼓舞。许多研究人员纷纷发言，认为苏联第二个宇宙火箭到达月球，说明苏联科学研究又进入了一个更新的阶段。副研究员林同骥说：苏联第二个宇宙火箭的最后一级带有控制器，这是火箭结构上的一个重大改进。研究员李敏华说：苏联这一次放射宇宙火箭，各地都有测量站，收集测量的数据，观察轨道的因素，从而可以看出这一次发射火箭是以轨道为重点。从苏联几次发射火箭的情况，还可以看出他们每次都有明确的目的性，都是有计划、有步骤、而又是跃进的。苏联所测量的数据——即过去对宇宙自然现象的了解和轨道控制的准确，是向星际航行迈进了一大步。副研究员林鸿荪说：苏联这次发射的火箭，有几点值得注意的新成就：一、月球绕地球每秒一公里，火箭也在高速运行，如果没有准确的轨道，两个物体是会失之交臂的；二、火箭到达月球时，冲力很大，相对月球每秒速度是三公里，而带有苏联国徽的火箭能够到达月球，这是结构和速度控制方面的新的成就，它有利于解决火箭安全着陆的问题。现在能把小的物体送到月球，将来完全可能把更大的、以至把人送上月球；三、火箭到达月球时，一路上发出有价值的情报，作为人类科学研究的重要资料，为人类飞向月球铺平了道路；四、苏联第一个宇宙火箭即接近火星的轨道，根据这一火箭速度，稍为增加，完全有可能到达火星。研究人员在发言中，还一致认为：苏联成功地发射这个火箭它再一次显示了社会主义阵营保卫和平力量的强大；再一次证明东风压倒西风，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越。
    据新华社14日讯　苏联第二个宇宙火箭到达月球表面后，北京航空学院副教授何庆芝、赵震炎兴奋地对新华社记者说，从此月亮上有了人类的标志——苏联宇宙火箭留下的标志，这是人类历史上的大喜事，也是社会主义阵营的大喜事。
    北京大学副校长、力学家周培源说，苏联第二个宇宙火箭按预定计划射到月球，说明自动控制系统的精确和计算的准确。苏联宇宙火箭的新成就，开辟了人类从地球通往另一个天体的道路，为今后宇宙火箭的发展和宇宙空间的研究，揭开了新的一页。
    这一消息轰动了整个北京，全市各界人民欢腾鼓舞，齐声欢呼这一有历史意义的巨大成就。北京市人民代表、北京第一机床厂工人郑彤生说：苏联老大哥创造出了历史上空前未有的成就，更增加了我们加速进行社会主义建设的信心。
    据新华社天津14日电　天津市各界人民热烈欢呼苏联人民对征服宇宙空间作出的新贡献。
    天津大学校长、物理学家张国藩说：苏联第二个宇宙火箭最后一节的重量比第一个重三十九公斤，火箭携带的仪器也加多，控制操纵系统又有改进。把这个火箭发射到达月球表面成功，无疑将得到很多新的珍贵的资料，从而把宇宙飞行科学又向前推进一大步。同时，这对人类和平事业也是一个极大的贡献。它显示出苏联的科学技术水平，已经把帝国主义远远抛在后面，帝国主义分子们对这个火箭只有望天兴叹，内心发抖。我们中国的科学家向苏联科学家致以衷心的祝贺，并要更好地学习他们为科学与和平事业而辛勤工作的精神。
    中国科学院河北省分院院长、南开大学校长杨石先说：苏联第二个宇宙火箭发射到月球表面成功，这里可以看到在社会主义制度下科学事业正以飞跃的步伐发展，是资本主义国家望尘莫及的。苏联科学家在征服宇宙空间一系列的辉煌战果，大大加强了维护世界和平的力量，使帝国主义企图继续进行冷战的阴谋，又受到了一次沉重的打击。
    天津第一钢厂的齐子升炼钢小组的工人们，听到苏联宇宙火箭到达月球表面的消息后，欢欣鼓舞，齐子升高兴的说：苏联科学的伟大成就，世界无可比拟，我们要一日千里地前进，让帝国主义气破肚子吧。
    据新华社上海14日电　苏联第二个宇宙火箭准确地飞到了月球表面，第一次实现了人类飞向另一个天体的伟大理想的喜讯，给上海市科学界人士带来了极大的欢欣和鼓舞。
    中国科学院上海分院副院长周仁说：“苏联能把这么大的火箭准确地射到月球，充分地说明了苏联在电子学、计算技术、自动化等许多尖端科学技术方面，都已达到了很高的水平。”
    上海邮电管理局副局长兼总工程师孙洪钧说：“苏联第二个宇宙火箭胜利地到达月宫，是社会主义阵营的坚强堡垒苏联又一次对人类征服宇宙和保卫世界和平事业作出的巨大贡献，这是东风进一步压倒西风的又一证明。”
    上海市无线台管理处主任工程师王琪从无线电讯方面赞扬了苏联的这一伟大成就，他说：“苏联第二个宇宙火箭对地球的无线电联系部分使用了普通的高频频段，这说明苏联无线电遥测和遥控技术的优越。”
    据新华社南京14日电　苏联第二个宇宙火箭到达月球表面的消息传到南京后，中国科学院紫金山天文台台长张钰哲对新华社记者发表谈话说：这是人类在征服宇宙的过程中，又向前迈进了一大步。人类从来不曾把他们所创造的东西，送达地球以外的另一个天体上面去。探险家把国旗插在南北极人迹不到的地方，已经是了不起的成就。如今把带有国徽和文字标记的东西送到月球上面，可比地上的南北极远的多了。张钰哲说：控制宇宙火箭的速度，使它落到月球表面上去，比发射人造行星更复杂。火箭超过了第二宇宙速度把它发射出后就可以成为人造行星。但是若要火箭能被月球吸引住，它相对于月球的速度不可以太大；而对于地球讲，又要达到第二宇宙速度，使它能够脱离地球引力的影响。这次发射火箭的日期选在上弦后几天，这借以利用地球自转来减低火箭和月球的相对速度。当然方向的瞄准和速度的恰当，对于到达月球具有同样重要的意义。
    南京大学数学天文系副主任戴文赛教授欢呼苏联在征服宇宙空间上这一辉煌的成就，他说：人类第一次把一个用自己智慧创造出来的物体发射到地球外一个天体上面，这真是一个具有历史意义的事件。戴文赛说：第一个宇宙火箭发射成功的主要意义是突破了第二宇宙速度的大关，证明了使一个人造物体克服地球引力而永远离开地球是可能的。第二个宇宙火箭则有意地使它落在月球表面，从而为人类飞向月球铺平道路。
