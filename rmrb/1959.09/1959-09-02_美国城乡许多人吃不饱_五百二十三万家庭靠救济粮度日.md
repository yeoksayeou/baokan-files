    Many People in American Cities and Rural Areas Are Undernourished
    5.23 Million Families Rely on Food Relief to Survive
    This newspaper reports that in the United States, hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits and an increasing number of bankrupt farmers have lost all sources of income and have to beg for government-issued food relief to survive. According to statistics from the American Labor Problems Research Association, the number of families living on food relief has increased from 3.17 million in 1956 to 5.23 million at the beginning of this year, reaching the highest figure since 1942.
    The proportion of people in need of relief in various states and cities is astonishing. According to recent reports in the American press, in West Virginia's two million residents, 300,000 people (approximately one-sixth of the state's population) rely partially or entirely on "feed" to survive ("feed" is the local term for government-rationed grain). In Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, one in ten residents is receiving food under the Federal Surplus Commodities Donation Program. In the Bell area of Kentucky, one-quarter of the 1,364 farming households rely on government food relief to survive. Kentucky Congressman Siler recently published a letter from his constituent Miller in the "Congressional Record" that read, "People in this area are simply starving to death. Residents severely lack food, clothing, housing... Thousands of people, young and old, are hungry, though not yet starved to death."
    The amount of food received by those on relief is pitifully small. According to a report in the "New York Times," the "surplus" food received by a family each month is not enough for three weeks of consumption, and these "surplus" foods taken from government warehouses are nutritionally deficient. However, even these "nutritionally deficient and insufficient" "surplus" goods are not easily obtained.

    美国城乡许多人吃不饱
    五百二十三万家庭靠救济粮度日
    本报讯　在美国，有成千上万的领完失业救济金的失业工人和日益众多的破产农民，失去了一切生活来源，不得不乞求于政府发放的救济粮过活。据美国劳动问题调查协会统计，这种靠救济粮度日的家庭已从1956年的三百一十七万家增加到今年初的五百二十三万家，达到了1942年以来的最高数字。
    在各州市中，需要救济的人数所占比例十分惊人。据美国报刊最近报道：在西弗吉尼亚州的二百万居民中，就有三十万人（约占全州人口的六分之一）部分或全部依靠“饲料”过活（“饲料”是当地人对政府配给的粮食的称呼）。在美国汽车工业中心的底特律市，每十个居民中就有一个在根据联邦剩余物资赠送计划领取粮食。在肯塔基州的贝尔地区的一千三百六十四个农户中，四分之一的农民要靠政府的救济粮度日。美国肯塔基州众议员赛勒最近在“国会纪录”中发表的他的选民米勒给他的一封信上写道：“在这个地区，人们简直要饿死了。居民严重缺乏食物、衣着、住宅……成千上万的人，不分老少，虽然还没有饿死，但都是饥肠辘辘。”
    受到救济的人所领得的粮食是少得可怜的。据“纽约时报”的报道，一个家庭每月领取的“剩余”食品，不够三星期的食用，而这些从政府仓库中取出来的“剩余”食物又是缺乏营养的食物。然而，就连这种“缺乏营养而且数量不够”的“剩余”物资，也是得之不易的。
