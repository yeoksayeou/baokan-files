Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 29th. The No. 3 hydroelectric generator at the Huangtankou Hydropower Station in Zhejiang has been installed and is officially generating electricity. Before power generation, it underwent a seventy-two-hour power-on trial run, proving that it fully meets technical standards.

　　The equipment capacity of the No. 3 generator is 7,500 kilowatts. Together with the already-built No. 1 and No. 2 generators, the equipment capacity of the Huangtankou Hydropower Station will be 22,500 kilowatts, which can meet the electricity needs of construction sites such as Xin'anjiang and some factories in Quzhou, Jiangshan, and other places.

　　Currently, workers are speeding up the installation of the No. 4 generator.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 29th. The builders of the giant Liujiaxia Hydropower Station victoriously completed the stone excavation project of the diversion tunnel on the 26th, presenting a gift for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

　　The diversion tunnel is one of the key projects in the early stage of Liujiaxia's construction. During the upcoming impoundment period, the water of the Yellow River will be forced to flow through the tunnel and then downstream, in order to free up the riverbed for the construction of the dam. After the power station is completed, it will also be used as a spillway.

　　This tunnel has a diameter of 15.2 meters and a length of 784 meters, and three rows of trains can run parallel inside. The total amount of stone excavation for the entire project is more than 190,000 cubic meters. The workers of Liujiaxia adopted the method of "using indigenous methods first, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and gradually mechanizing" for construction, working hard and skillfully, overcoming many difficulties, and excavated the tunnel in only a little over eleven months. The lining work can be fully completed in another month. (Attached picture)

    黄坛口水电站三号电机发电
    刘家峡水电站挖完导流隧洞
    新华社杭州29日电　浙江黄坛口水电站三号水轮发电机安装完毕正式发电。发电前，经过七十二小时带电试运行，证明完全符合技术标准。
    三号发电机的设备容量是七千五百瓩，加上已经建成的一、二两号发电机，黄坛口水电站的设备容量就有二万二千五百瓩，可以满足新安江等工地以及衢州、江山等地一些工厂需要的电力。
    目前，职工正在加快安装第四号发电机。
    新华社兰州29日电　刘家峡巨型水电站的建设者们，在26日胜利完成了导流隧洞的石方开挖工程，向建国十周年献礼。
    导流隧洞是刘家峡建设前期的重点工程之一。在即将开始的截流期间，黄河河水将被逼流经隧洞再往下泄，以便腾出河床来修筑大坝。在电站竣工后，它还将作为溢洪道使用。
    这个隧洞直径有十五点二米，长有七百八十四米，里面可以并行三列火车。全部工程的石方开挖量达十九万多公方。刘家峡的职工采用“土法上马，洋土结合，逐步机械化”的方法施工，大干巧干，克服了许多困难，只用十一个多月的时间就把隧洞开挖好了，再有一个月就可以全部完成衬砌工作。（附图片）
