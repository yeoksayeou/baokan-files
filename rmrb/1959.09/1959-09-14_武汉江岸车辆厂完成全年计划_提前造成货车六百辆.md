Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 13th: The Wuhan Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant completed its annual task of manufacturing six hundred new freight cars on September 7th, ahead of schedule, fulfilling its guarantee to offer a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The Jiang'an Rolling Stock Plant only transitioned from repair to manufacturing in the latter half of last year, and faced many difficulties in production this year, such as insufficient equipment, inadequate technical expertise, and shortages of raw materials. However, since the beginning of the year, the entire plant launched a socialist labor emulation campaign and a technical innovation movement, relying on the hard work and ingenuity of all employees to overcome these difficulties. By July, the plant had completed more than 76% of its task of manufacturing new freight cars.

After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the enthusiasm of the entire plant's employees soared even higher. Although the plant increased its major freight car repair task by an average of seventy-six cars per month starting in August, this did not affect the employees' determination to complete the annual task of manufacturing six hundred new freight cars ahead of schedule. They launched even more enthusiastic head-to-head competitions, inter-process competitions, competitions between workers of the same type and using the same machine tools, apprenticeship competitions, and technical demonstration competitions.

At the same time, the entire plant vigorously promoted the experience of Wu Lianghu, an advanced producer and Communist Party member who twice left his own group to help lagging groups, assisting some of the lagging groups to catch up with the advanced ones. Wu Lianghu himself was once again transferred from his own group to the brake beam group, which was failing to complete its plan, helping this group to implement five technical innovations, which quickly more than doubled the daily output of brake beams.

As a result of the above measures, the factory newly manufactured 120 freight cars and overhauled more than 30 in August, exceeding the output of any previous month. By September 7, the annual task of manufacturing 600 new freight cars had been fully completed.

    武汉江岸车辆厂完成全年计划  提前造成货车六百辆
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉江岸车辆厂提前在本月7日完成全年六百辆新造货车的任务，提前实现了向国庆十周年献礼的保证。
    江岸车辆厂从去年下半年才由修理转为制造，今年生产中还存在着许多困难。如设备不足，技术力量跟不上，原料和材料缺乏等。但是，全厂从年初开始，开展了社会主义劳动竞赛和技术革新运动，依靠全体职工的苦干巧干，冲破了这些难关，到7月份为止，全厂就完成了新造货车任务的76％以上。
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议公布以后，全厂职工更是干劲冲天，从8月份起，全厂虽然平均每月增加了七十六辆货车的大修任务，但是这并没有影响职工们提前完成全年新造六百辆货车任务的决心。他们开展了更加热烈的对手赛，上下工序赛，同工种、同机床赛，师徒赛，技术表演赛。
    与此同时，全厂还大力推广两次离开自己小组去帮助落后小组的先进生产者、共产党员吴良湖的经验，帮助一部分落后小组赶上先进。吴良湖本人也再一次被调离自己的小组，来到完不成计划的制动梁小组，帮助这个小组实现了五项技术革新，使制动梁日产量很快提高一倍以上。
    由于采取了以上的种种措施，八月份，这个厂新造了货车一百二十辆，大修三十多辆，产量超过了以前任何一个月；到九月七日，全年新造六百辆货车的任务，已经全部完成了。
