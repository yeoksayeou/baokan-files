Pushing the Upsurge of Overproduction to a New Climax
Public Communes in Suzhou Prefecture Revise Production Targets One After Another

The communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee are a tremendous force, pushing the vigorous over-contracted production movement underway in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, to a new peak.

People's communes and production teams have successively proposed over-contracted production targets and specific measures to achieve them, determined to fight drought, insect pests, and diseases to the end, and seize an even greater autumn harvest. After full discussions by cadres and the masses, the Qidun Commune in Kunshan, under the slogan of "Everyone contributes to over-contracted production, everyone sweats to increase by 30%," raised the rice contracted production target from 650 jin to 750 jin, an increase of another 15%. They are preparing to immediately launch a mass movement to protect the ears and grains throughout the commune, vigorously grasp the late-stage management of mid- and late-season rice, resolutely fight drought to the end, and ensure a bumper harvest in every plot. Members of the Heping Brigade of the Jinshan Commune in Wu County, while studying the central government's communiqué and resolutions, immediately dispatched 300 laborers to camp at the foot of Lingyan Mountain, working in shifts day and night to focus on drought resistance and irrigation for 200 mu of high-lying fields. Members of the Guizhuang Commune in Taicang County organized more than 2,300 people to launch a surprise attack on rice borer eggs in one day on the 27th.

Many places in the district have also formulated plans to save grain and sell more surplus grain to support the country. Inspired by the communiqué and resolutions, the Eighth Team of the Nineteenth Brigade of the Chefang Commune in Wu County completed the task of selling 80,000 jin of early rice on the 27th and over-fulfilled the sale of 6,000 jin of stored grain.

    把超产运动推向新高潮
    苏州专区各公社纷纷修订生产指标
    党的八中全会的公报和决议是一个巨大的力量，把江苏省苏州专区正在开展的热火朝天的超包产运动，推向新的高峰。
    各人民公社和生产队纷纷提出了超包产的指标和实现指标的具体措施，决心与旱虫病害斗争到底，夺取秋熟更大丰收。昆山茜墩公社经过干部群众的充分讨论，在“人人出力超包产，个个出汗增三成”的口号下，水稻包产指标由六百五十斤提高到七百五十斤，再增产一成半。他们准备在全社内立即开展一个保穗保粒的群众运动，狠抓中晚稻的后期管理，坚决做到抗旱抗到底，块块保丰收。吴县金山公社和平大队的社员们一面学习中央的公报和决议，一面立即抽出三百个劳力，扎营灵岩山下，日夜轮班重点抗旱灌溉二百亩高田。太仓县归庄公社的社员们，在27日一天内组织了二千三百多人突击除螟卵。
    全区许多地方还订出了节约用粮、多卖余粮支援国家的计划。吴县车坊公社十九大队八小队，在公报和决议的鼓舞下，27日完成了八万斤早稻出售任务，并且超额出售了六千斤陈粮。
