He pointed out that he has already established the Provisional Supreme Advisory Council and the National Planning Council in accordance with this principle. The upcoming People's Consultative Assembly will also be established on the basis of cooperation. He said that the future National Front – not the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian – will also unite all ethnic groups and all revolutionary forces in the country.

Sukarno said that during his recent inspection tours to various places, he found that the Indonesian Communist Party is one of the forces supporting the 1945 Constitution and national unity. He said, "I respect the Indonesian Communist Party." The Indonesian Communist Party has made contributions to the revolution, Indonesian Communists are warriors for independence and anti-imperialism, and they are valuable to other Indonesians.

    苏加诺总统说，印度尼西亚共产党近几年来明确地主张民族团结。苏加诺说，在他最近到各地视察期间，他发现印度尼西亚共产党是支持1945年宪法和民族团结的各种力量之一。他说，“我尊重印度尼西亚共产党。”印度尼西亚共产党对革命作出了贡献，印度尼西亚共产党人是争取独立和反对帝国主义的战士，他们对其他印度尼西亚人来说是宝贵的。
    苏加诺总统说，目前的形势并不能使他自己和其他的人感到满意，但是，他们仍然能够前进。苏加诺号召一切人团结得像一个人一样，以便击败政治上和经济上的帝国主义。

    印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地在招待会上讲话时说，印度尼西亚共产党第六次代表大会的胜利也是爱国和民主运动的胜利。他指出，印度尼西亚的最主要的敌人是帝国主义，而人民中间的矛盾必须通过协商来解决。人民中间的猜疑必须消除，一切人民的力量必须联合起来，并且加以巩固。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党将同爱国和民主的阶级、集团和个人合作，它将联合一切人民力量，并且加强印度尼西亚共产党和国际共产主义运动的联系。
