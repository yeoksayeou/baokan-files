Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 4th: Shanghai commercial sector workers are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, determined to do everything possible to cooperate with the production front's increased production campaign and exceed the purchasing targets for September and the entire year.

In August, the purchasing performance of Shanghai's commercial sector increased by 24.9% compared to July and 40.6% compared to the same period last year, reaching the highest level this year. The purchase volume of 25 major commodities increased significantly compared to July, with increases of more than 50% for items such as towels, gold pens, bicycles, and radios, and increases of more than 130% for rubber shoes and sewing machines. After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, employees of various purchasing departments revised their targets, actively supported industrial production, and expanded sources of goods. The purchasing and supply stations under the First Commercial Bureau guaranteed to exceed the September purchasing plan by 11% and to exceed the annual purchasing plan by 15% over four months of intense effort. Employees of the Transportation Electrical Equipment Purchasing and Supply Station guaranteed to complete a purchasing plan of 160 million yuan in September, which is equivalent to 88% of the actual purchasing performance in July and August.

Recently, a mass movement to support industrial production has been launched among purchasing personnel in Shanghai's commercial sector. Thirteen purchasing stations and specialized companies under the First Commercial Bureau, led by Party Committee secretaries and consisting of 55 work teams, accompanied purchasing agents to factories to understand production conditions, connected with industrial companies to coordinate industry-commerce collaboration plans, and liaised with relevant materials departments to ensure the allocation of raw materials. The work team of the Party Committee of the Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station, cooperating with the hardware section employees of the station, purchased dozens of tons of various raw materials such as scrap steel within a few days, supplying them to various factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 4th: Inspired by the call of the Party Central Committee, 200,000 commercial employees in Tianjin are determined to work hard in September to support industrial and agricultural production and do a good job in market supply.

The various purchasing and supply stations that manage industrial products, after exceeding the August procurement plan by 4.9%, are doing everything possible to expand the source of goods, guaranteeing that the procurement amount in September will increase by more than 20% compared to August. The leading cadres of each supply station are connecting production and sales plans with the factories, helping the factories overcome difficulties in production, and promoting increased production in the factories. The textile and dyeing industries urgently need grey cloth, dyes, and machine materials in September. The Tianjin Textile Purchasing and Supply Station organized more than 20 cadres, divided into four groups, to purchase these raw materials in Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces. The employees of this station also organized factory workers to exchange experiences and jointly improve output and quality. For example, weaving workers from Xindelong, Fuyuanxiang, and other factories producing tuxedo fabrics were organized to visit and learn from the Yazhou factory, which has the highest hourly output of tuxedo fabrics, so that the production of each factory successively reached the advanced level of the Yazhou factory.

The units managing non-staple food products, on the basis of successfully completing the August procurement and sales plans, fully mobilized the masses to discuss and determine that the procurement amount in September will increase by 56.86% compared to August, and the sales amount will increase by 20.68% compared to August. Each unit has organized more than 5,000 people to go to Xinjiang and other places and to the counties under the jurisdiction of this city to organize sources of goods.
