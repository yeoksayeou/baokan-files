    Ancient Cultural Site Discovered in Ningyang, Shandong
    Recently, in Boutou Village, south of the Wenhe Iron Bridge in Dawenkou, Ningyang County, Shandong Province, during the construction of the Jinpu Railway double-track project, an ancient cultural site and burial ground were discovered where painted pottery, black pottery, and white pottery coexist. The site is located on a flat terrace, five meters above the river. The Jinpu Railway double track passes directly through the middle of the site, and as a result, two-fifths of the site has already been destroyed. The Jinan Municipal Bureau of Culture has reported to the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Culture to jointly organize forces to go to the construction site to cooperate in the cleanup and protection work. More than 130 tombs and a kiln site have already been cleared. Only five of the tombs are large. The large tombs have pits, outer coffins, and inner coffins, with pits more than four meters long and about three meters wide; medium-sized tombs have inner coffins but no outer coffins, but have two-tiered platforms.
    There are many relics in the tombs, and their forms are special. There are smoothly polished perforated stone axes, stone shovels, stone adzes, and other tools; bone needles, fishhooks, and various bone carved ornaments. Most importantly, plain polished white pottery, red pottery, black pottery, gray pottery, and sand-tempered red pottery were unearthed from the tombs. There is also a small amount of painted pottery in black, white, and red. Its characteristic is that it is colored first and then fired in a kiln, and the color is bright and does not easily fall off.
    This is the first time in the country that a site with coexisting painted pottery, white pottery, and black pottery, along with these burial grounds, has been discovered.

    山东宁阳发现古文化遗址
    最近，山东省宁阳县大汶口汶河铁桥南面堡头村，在修建津浦铁路复线工程中，发现一个有彩陶、黑陶、白陶共存的古文化遗址和墓葬群。遗址是在一个平坦的台地上，高出河面五米。津浦铁路复线正从遗址中间穿过，因而已有五分之二的遗址被破坏。济南市文化局已经报请山东省文化局共同组织力量前往该工地配合进行清理和保护工作。目前已经清理了一百三十多座墓葬和一座窑地。墓葬中只有五座较大的。大墓都有坑有椁有棺，坑长四米多，宽约三米；中型墓有棺无椁，但有二层台。
    墓葬中遗物很多，而且形式特殊。有磨制光滑的穿孔石斧、石铲、石?等工具；骨针、鱼钩以及各种骨雕装饰品。最重要的是，墓中出土的有素面磨光的白陶器、红陶器、黑陶器、灰陶器和夹沙红陶器。还有少数彩陶是黑、白、红三色，它的特点是先施彩后经窑烧，色彩光亮，不易脱落。
    彩陶、白陶、黑陶共存的遗址和这些墓葬群，在全国范围内是第一次发现。
