Haihe River, Why Are You So Beautiful?
By Fang Ji

On January 15, 1949, before dawn, a sharp knife company of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army broke through the enemy's defense line at Xiyingmen in Tianjin and planted the first red flag on a tall building in the urban area of Tianjin.

On the same morning, we followed the attacking troops into Tianjin.

On the asphalt road under our feet, the electric wires, broken by artillery fire, were scattered all over the ground. In the gaps between the wires in the middle of the road, there were white circles freshly drawn with chalk, and the soldiers would say to anyone passing by:

"Comrade, landmine!"

But they themselves nimbly crossed these black and white, geometric-shaped circles, leaping forward to pursue the enemy.

The logistics troops and civilian laborers were already cleaning up the battlefield. They were digging out the bodies of enemy soldiers buried in bunkers by artillery fire, and collecting the wounded enemy soldiers lying on both sides of the road groaning; then, they were loaded onto carts that had come from hundreds of miles away to support the liberation of Tianjin, and transported to the outside of the city.

The gunfire had not stopped, but the streets of the city were already filled with jubilation. Around Commander-in-Chief Zhu's large-character notice, crowds of people gathered, red and green slogans were posted, and parades marched in all directions, shouting slogans. ... And above this jubilant crowd, electrical workers were climbing on tall utility poles, rushing to repair the lines broken by artillery fire.

Passing through the jubilant streets and the crowded people, another comrade and I entered the city and walked to the Haihe River.

On both sides of the Haihe River, rows of tall chimneys and huge buildings stood, with iron gates tightly closed, and foreign banks and warehouses with foreign signs hanging.

Liberation Army soldiers, covered in gunpowder smoke, their faces blackened but their eyes particularly bright, were standing or sitting on tanks parked at the head of the "French Bridge," smoking cigarettes.

The war had stopped, and the city was liberated.

At this moment, I saw several other soldiers carrying the body of one of their comrades past me. This soldier who had been killed was very young, even a child. The fine hairs on his temples were clearly visible, his long eyelashes covered his tightly closed eyes, and his lips curved into a beautiful arc, as if smiling in a sweet dream.

However, a bullet had passed right through the middle of his heart. He was dead, his left hand still resting on his chest, his right hand drooping down, clenched into a fist.

After they passed, fresh red blood, like agate in the sunlight, dripped drop by drop onto the frozen road on the bank of the Haihe River.

I turned my head and looked at the Haihe River. The Haihe River was flowing with the torrents of spring. Huge ice floes floated, rotated, and collided, sparkling in the sunlight, making a gnashing sound, flowing towards the Dagukou estuary.

Ten years have passed, and I cannot forget this impression. The young soldier's smiling face as if in sweet sleep, the agate-like blood droplets sparkling in the sunlight.

Looking at the surging Haihe River, such a line of poetry once emerged in my heart:

"Haihe River, why are you so beautiful?"

For ten years, I have wanted to use it as the title to write a poem about the Haihe River.

For ten years, I have lived by its side, watching it change day by day, becoming more and more beautiful. By its side, rows of towering chimneys spew thick smoke day and night; those buildings with foreign signs have changed masters; those warehouses that stored the blood of the oppressed Chinese people like blood banks are now filled with the necessities of the people's lives. Ships with five-star red flags fly on the Haihe River; foreign warships painted with "Citibank", "Union Jack" and "Band-Aid" insignias are no longer seen rampaging! And on a morning in October 1958, the Haihe Dam was closed. Countless twenty-ton pieces of firewood and stone were simultaneously thrown into the Haihe River from both ends of the dam by the powerful arms of the Liberation Army soldiers and civilian laborers, cutting off the surging backflow of seawater. The Haihe River has become a calm, clear, sweet water lake.

"Haihe River, why are you so beautiful?"

Our readers have all seen Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise," right? These two plays are set in Tianjin. It is said that the building where the story of "Thunderstorm" takes place, with its church-style spire, narrow English-style windows, and a small garden, still stands lonely in a corner of the city. Perhaps the owner of this building, the characters in "Thunderstorm," still live there; but life has changed. Just take this corner, for example. Across the street from this house, facing its door, is the former British Consulate; next to it is the Kailuan Mining Bureau; and across the street is the British Engineering Bureau of the foreign government built on other people's territory; and behind the Kailuan Building, there is also a very unharmonious, low and small Chinese-style vermilion cloistered courtyard, which is the "palace" prepared for the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi.

This corner, the environment where the story of "Thunderstorm" takes place, typically shows the nature of old Tianjin.

Now, the Kailuan Building, along with their "Consulate" and "Engineering Bureau," has become the location of the Tianjin Party and government leadership organs, the center of the political and economic life of the people of Tianjin. The brilliant national emblem of the People's Republic of China hangs high above the door, and the bright five-star red flag flutters in the wind. Every day, the working people go in and out of here, a series of meetings are held here, and various instructions and orders are issued from here, guiding the people of Tianjin to build a completely new life.

It is also possible to mention the hotel described in "Sunrise." It is still there, still a hotel. But there are no longer parasitic characters like Chen Bailu inside. People like "Manager Pan" have either gone bankrupt long before liberation, or are undergoing reform after liberation. "Master Jin" and his "Big Black Three" were thoroughly purged after liberation. Now, only the building that the workers built by pounding the earth and singing songs before "Sunrise" still stands towering opposite the hotel.

How much of Tianjin's life did we learn from these two plays in the past! Good people suffered here, and people with ideals and strength could not find a way out. Only people like Zhou Puyuan used etiquette and money to control people's fate; people like Jin Ba used bloody hands to strangle a lonely and helpless "little thing"!

Who can change this life? Change the fate of the people of Tianjin? The heroic Boxers failed, and whether it was "Second Young Master" or "Fang Dasheng," they still belonged to the category of the bourgeoisie; Lu Dahai's departure, the sound of pounding the earth before sunrise, was still only the author's bright vision at the time.

There is another kind of power, another kind of struggle here. This is the modern working class that appeared as early as 1870 when Li Hongzhang, the Governor-General of Zhili and Minister of Beiyang of the Qing Dynasty, established the Tianjin Machine Bureau. They have an earlier history and longer training than the Chinese bourgeoisie. They appeared as early as the feudal bureaucratic capital era. And as soon as this new class appeared, they carried out heroic struggles accompanied by their hard work.

In 1918, Comrade Zhou Enlai, who was studying in Tianjin, organized the first communist group - the Awakening Society; in 1919, Martyr Ma Jun led the Tianjin "May Fourth" struggle; in 1923, Tianjin railway workers participated in the ranks of the "February 7th" general strike; after 1927, the CPC Shunzhi Provincial Committee and the later Hebei Provincial Committee have always insisted on Tianjin, leading the famous Tangshan Five Mines general strike, and the Tianjin yarn factory workers' strike struggle in previous years. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Peng Zhen, and other famous figures of the Party were the organizers and leaders of these heroic struggles.

Tianjin is not only a city humiliated under the feet of imperialism, but also a fighting city with a glorious revolutionary tradition.

The working class of Tianjin has created huge material wealth and spiritual power. Under their hands, life is surging forward like the Haihe River. If you get off the train and walk from the station to the city center, you may only feel its prosperity and busyness; even tension and congestion. Yes, the city's tall buildings, intricate streets, galloping vehicles, and bustling pedestrians show how much tremendous labor is going on! And the city's old form is obviously unable to accommodate the surging power of this great life. Perhaps it is precisely at this point that, whether you stand in front of the department store on Heping Road or the Quan'ye Market, you will strongly feel how powerful the vitality of this city is!

Yes, a new Tianjin is growing up under the hands of the working class. Especially the socialist transformation in 1955 and the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have significantly changed the face of Tianjin. Now, if you take a car, starting from Yangcun, passing through the Beicang machine manufacturing industrial area under construction, passing through the famous handicraft area of Hebei, passing through the bustling Heping Road, crossing the Haihe River on the Jiefang Bridge, and then passing through the textile industrial area, passing through the steel industrial area, passing through the beautiful Xinlicun People's Commune, as beautiful as the scenery of Jiangnan, driving to the Tanggu Marine Chemical Industrial Area, until the new port wharf where ships from all over the world are moored, climb the newly built Haihe River Sluice Gate, overlooking the Bohai Sea, overlooking the Pacific Ocean... Ah, how vast, how beautiful, at the gate of the capital, on the coast of the motherland, stands such a large industrial city!

I don't want to bother the readers with numbers and percentages, but it must be noted that the nature of Tianjin as a city has completely changed in all aspects. The absolute number of growth in production value in the past ten years is like a geometric progression; in the past, as a famous consumer city, the proportion of production means was less than one-fifth; and now, it has been reversed, and Tianjin has become a powerful production city.

Tianjin is one of the few old industrial bases in China, and its modern industry has a history of nearly a hundred years - this is by no means a trivial matter. It not only represents the accumulation of material wealth, but also represents the accumulation of industrial technology and production experience. Generations of bloodline workers have grown up here; skilled technical workers have supported all parts of the country in the past ten years. And on the basis of production development, Beiyang University, which was famous all over the country before the war - now Tianjin University, which has expanded tenfold, trains batches of scientific and technological cadres every year; the famous Nankai University, the newly built Normal University, Medical University, Conservatory of Music, Academy of Fine Arts, and various cultural facilities have made Tianjin not only a city with developed production, but also a new socialist city with developed culture.

Tianjin, as a city, has a history of nearly eight hundred years, starting from the Yuan Dynasty. In the poems of the Yuan people, Tianjin was already a "market gathering all kinds of boats, military farms lining up fields"; a "defense stronghold where soldiers and civilians lived together for a long time, half of them understood Wu songs," and a trade center between the north and south, and between China and foreign countries. The natural conditions of "specializing in the benefits of fishing and salt" have promoted its economic and cultural prosperity and development. Although not many scenic spots and historical sites have been preserved here, folk art closely related to this economic life has been preserved and developed: the famous Yangliuqing New Year paintings, Zhang's clay sculptures, brick carvings, paper cuttings, kites, etc.

This is also a concentrated reflection of the customs of the people of Tianjin. The people of Tianjin come from all over the country, but a long period of common life has formed their own customs, character, and language characteristics; it shows the boldness of the ocean and the tenderness of the water town... Now, all this is being given new content and new meaning by the new era and new life: the new socialist fashion has made the spiritual outlook of the people of Tianjin more radiant; it is like alum being put into water, all the dust settles, and the water quality is purer and clearer.

I have lived in Tianjin for ten years and have deeply fallen in love with this city, which has suffered deeply but is also heroic and unyielding. Every time in the evening, when I walk along the Haihe River with many people who come to stroll after intense labor, the impression I got here ten years ago reappears. Now, the beautiful Haihe Park has been built on the agate-like blood droplets of that young soldier. Opposite is the newly opened "May Day Square" this year, and the Haihe River flows to the sea in the middle, shimmering with silver waves. At this time, the lights on both sides of the river are on, and the five-pointed red star on the spire of the First Workers' Cultural Palace is lit. The lights are reflected in the heart of the river, like the stars twinkling in the sky; the Haihe River becomes bright and clear. It is as if the people of Tianjin threw their shining hearts into the river, making the Haihe River a living, huge force, flowing forward! Never stop. ...

At this time, the unfinished poem reappears in my heart -

"Haihe River, why are you so beautiful!"

### 海河，你为什么这样美丽？

    海河，你为什么这样美丽？
    方纪
    1949年1月15日，天亮以前，第四野战军某部尖刀连突破了天津西营门敌人的防线，把第一面红旗插在天津市区一座高大的建筑上。
    就在同一天早晨，我们跟随进攻的部队进入天津。
    脚下的柏油马路上，被炮火打断的电线，横直地拖了一地。马路中间，在电线的空隙中，全是粉笔刚刚划上的白圈，战士们随时对走过的人说：
    “同志，地雷！”
    而他们自己，却灵巧地越过这些黑白相间的、几何图形般的圆圈，跳跃前进，追击敌人。
    后勤部队和民工，已经在打扫战场了。挖掘被炮火埋在碉堡里敌兵的尸体，收容躺在马路两旁呻吟的敌兵伤员；然后，分别装在从几百里外赶来支援解放天津的民工大车上，运到市外去。
    枪声还没有停止，城市的街道上已经是一片欢腾了。在朱总司令的大字布告周围，挤满了人群，贴起了红绿的标语，游行的队伍向四面八方走着，高呼着口号。……而在这欢腾的人群之上，是电气工人们爬在高高的电杆上，抢修被炮火打断的线路。
    穿过欢腾的街道，拥挤的人群，我和另外一位同志，进入市内，走到海河边了。
    海河两岸，耸立着成排的高高的烟囱，庞大的建筑，紧紧关闭着铁门、挂了洋文招牌的外国银行和仓库。
    带着满身硝烟，面孔被熏得黧黑、而两只眼睛却显得特别光亮的解放军战士们，正站在或坐在停在“法国桥”头的坦克上抽烟。
    战争停止了，城市解放了。
    这时，我看见另外几个战士，抬了一位自己同伴的尸体，从我身旁走过。这位被打死的战士还十分年青，甚至还是个孩子。他两鬓的汗毛看得清清楚楚，长长的睫毛遮住了紧闭的眼睛，嘴唇弯成一道优美的弧形，像是在甜蜜的睡梦中微笑。
    然而一颗子弹，正从他心脏的中间穿过。他死了，左手还抚在胸前，右手垂下了，攥紧拳头。
    在他们走过去后，鲜红的血，在阳光下像玛瑙一般，一滴一滴滴在海河岸边冰冻的马路上。
    我转过头去，望着海河。海河里流动着春天的激流。巨大的冰块漂浮着，旋转着，撞击着，在阳光下闪耀着，发出咬牙切齿般的咯咯的声响，向大沽口外流去。
    十年了，我不能忘记这印象。这个年青的战士，像在甜睡中的微笑的脸，玛瑙般的在阳光下闪耀的血滴。
    望着奔腾的海河，当时我心里曾涌现出这样一行诗句：
    “海河，你为什么这样美丽？”
    十年了，我一直想用它做题目写一首关于海河的诗。
    十年了，我生活在它身边，看着它一天天变化，变得更加美丽。在它身边，成排的、高耸的烟囱日夜喷着浓烟；那些挂着洋文招牌的大厦改换了主人；那些像血库一样储存过被压榨的中国人民鲜血的仓库，满满地装进了人民生活必需的物资，海河里行驶着带上纹的五星红旗的船只；再也看不见了漆着“花旗”、“米字”和“膏药”的外国军舰横冲直撞！而在1958年10月的一个早晨，海河大坝合龙了。无数个重二十吨的柴石枕被解放军战士和民工的有力的臂膀，从大坝两端同时抛进海河，截断了汹涌倒灌的海水。海河，变成了平静的、碧澄的甜水湖。
    “海河，你为什么这样美丽？”
    我们的读者都看过曹禺的“雷雨”和“日出”吧？这两部戏就是以天津为背景的。据说是发生“雷雨”的故事的那所有着教堂式的尖顶，英国式的狭长窗子和一个小花园的建筑，至今还寂寞地站在市区的一个角落。也许这所建筑的主人，“雷雨”里的人物，还住在里面；但是，生活变了。就说这个角落吧，和这所房子门对门，隔一条马路，是原先的英国领事馆，他的旁边是开滦矿务局，对面，是在别人领土上建立起来的外国政府英国工部局；而在开滦大楼的背后，还有一座看起来十分不谐调的、低矮而小巧的中国式朱漆回廊的院落，这便是他们为当年的中国女皇帝那拉氏预备的“行宫”。
    就是这个角落，这个发生“雷雨”故事的环境，典型地表明了旧天津的性质。
    现在，开滦大楼，连同他们的“领事馆”、“工部局”成为了天津党政领导机关的所在地，成为了天津人民政治和经济生活的中心。灿烂的中华人民共和国国徽门首高挂，鲜艳的五星红旗迎风飘扬。每天，劳动人民从这里出出进进，一系列的会议在这里举行，从这里发出各种指示和命令，引导着天津人民建设一种全新的生活。
    还可以提到“日出”所描写的那个旅馆。它也还在，还是一个旅馆。但那里面再也没有了像陈白露那样的寄生人物。“潘经理”之类有的固然早在解放前就破产了，有的在解放后正接受改造。“金八爷”以及他手下的“大黑三”之类，在解放后被彻底地肃清了。现在只有那座在“日出”之前，工人们就打着夯，唱着歌建筑起来的大楼，还巍然矗立在旅馆的对面。
    过去我们从这两部戏里了解到多少天津的生活呵！好人在这里受苦，有理想、有力量的人找不到出路。而只有像周朴园那样的人，用礼教、用金钱，支配着人们的命运；像金八那样的人，用血手，生生扼死一个孤苦无告的“小东西”！
    谁能改变这种生活？改变天津人们的命运？英勇的义和团失败了，而无论“二少爷”也好，“方达生”也好，他们还同属于资产阶级范畴里的人物；出走了的鲁大海，日出前的打夯声，在当时也还是作者光明的憧憬而已。
    这里有另外一种力量，另外一种斗争。这就是从1870年清朝的直隶总督北洋大臣李鸿章设天津机器局起，就已经出现了的近代工人阶级。他们有比中国资产阶级更早的历史，更长的锻炼，他们早在封建的官僚资本时代就出现了。而这个新的阶级一出现，就伴随着他们苦重的劳动，进行了英勇的斗争。
    1918年，正在天津读书的周恩来同志组织了第一个共产主义的团体——觉悟社；1919年，马骏烈士领导了天津的“五四”斗争；1923年，天津铁路工人参加了“二七”大罢工的行列；1927年以后，中共顺直省委和后来的河北省委，就一直坚持在天津，领导了有名的唐山五矿大罢工，和历年的天津纱厂工人罢工斗争。党的著名人物刘少奇同志，彭真同志等等，就是这些英勇斗争的组织者和领导者。
    天津，不只是一个屈辱在帝国主义脚下的城市，而且是一个有光荣革命传统的战斗的城市。
    天津的工人阶级，创造了巨大的物质财富和精神力量。在他们手下，生活像海河一样奔腾前去。如果你下了火车，从车站走到市中心，也许你仅能感觉到它的繁华与繁忙；甚至紧张和拥挤。是的，这个城市的高大的建筑，错综的街道，奔驰的车辆和熙攘的行人，表现了多么巨大的劳动正在进行呵！而这个城市旧有的形体，已经显然容纳不下这巨大生活的冲激力量了。也许正是在这一点上，当你无论站在和平路的百货大楼、或者劝业场门前，你会强烈地感觉到，这个城市拥有多么强大的生命力呵！
    是的，一个新的天津正在工人阶级的手下成长起来。特别是1955年的社会主义改造，1958年的大跃进，明显地改变了天津的面貌。现在，如果你坐上汽车，从杨村开始，穿过正在兴建中的北仓机器制造工业区，穿过河北著名的手工业区，穿过繁华的和平路，在解放桥上跨过海河，然后，穿过纺织工业区，穿过钢铁工业区，穿过秀丽一如江南景色的新立村人民公社，驰向塘沽海洋化学工业区、直到停泊着来自世界各国船只的新港码头，登上新建的海河节制闸，了望渤海，了望太平洋……呵，多么辽阔，多么美好，在首都的大门口，在祖国的海岸边，矗立着一个多么大的工业城市！
    我不想用数目字和百分比来麻烦读者，但是必须注意到，天津这个城市的性质，就各方面说已经统统改变了。十年来生产价值绝对数的增长，就像几何级数那样；过去作为有名的消费城市，生产资料生产的比重不到五分之一；而现在，颠倒过来了，天津成了一个强大的生产城市。
    天津是我国少数旧有的工业基地之一，它的近代工业有将近一百年的历史——这一点决不是无足轻重的事。它不但代表着物质财富的积累，也代表着工业技术和生产经验的积累。世代相传的血统工人在这里成长起来了；熟练的技术工人十年来支援了全国各地。而在生产发展的基础上，早在战前就闻名全国的北洋大学——现在成十倍地扩展了的天津大学，每年培养出成批的科学和技术干部；有名的南开大学，新建的师范大学、医科大学、音乐学院、美术学院，以及各种文化设施，使天津成了一个不仅生产发展，而且文化发达的崭新的社会主义城市。
    天津作为一个城市，从元代算起也有近八百年的历史了。在元人诗中，天津就已经是一个“市集诸番舶，军屯列郡田”；“兵民杂居久，一半解吴歌”的海防要地，和南北、中外的贸易中心。“特擅渔盐之利”的自然条件，促成了它经济与文化的繁荣发展。这里虽然没有多少名胜古迹保留下来，但保留和发展了和这种经济生活密切相关的民间艺术：有名的杨柳青年画，泥人张彩塑，刻砖、剪纸、风筝等等。
    这也是天津人民风习的集中反映。天津人来自各地，但是长期的共同生活形成了自己的风习、性格、和语言的特色；它表现了海洋的粗犷和水乡的柔媚……现在，这一切，正在被新的时代、新的生活，赋予新的内容、新的意义：社会主义的新风尚使天津人的精神面貌变得更加光彩焕发了；就像是明矾放进水里，一切尘沙沉淀，而水质更加纯洁、明净。
    我在天津一住就是十年，深深地爱上了这个苦难深重而又英勇不屈的城市。每当傍晚，当我和许多在紧张劳动过后，到海河边上来散步的人一起走着的时候，便又涌现出十年前在这里得到的印象。现在，在那个青年战士的玛瑙般的血滴上，建起了美丽的海河公园。对面是今年新辟的“五一广场”，海河在中间闪着银波向大海流去。这时，两岸的灯光亮了，第一工人文化宫尖顶上的五角红星亮了。灯光映入河心，像是天空闪烁的繁星；海河变得灿烂而明净。就像天津人民把自己的发光的心抛进河里，使海河变成了有生命的巨大的力量，奔流向前！永不停止。……
    这时，那句未完成的诗又涌现在我心里——
    “海河，你为什么这样美丽！”
