Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, Madrid: The Spanish Communist Party and other progressive forces recently launched a movement to fight for "amnesty for imprisoned and exiled political prisoners." This movement has received widespread support and backing both within Spain and abroad.

Many prominent figures in Spain have expressed their support for this movement. Seventeen people, including individuals from all walks of life, said in a letter to the Minister of Justice of the Franco government that they believe that in no way can the fact that thousands of Spaniards are unable to participate in national life due to being imprisoned or forced into exile be justified. They pointed out that the time has come to eliminate the obstacles hindering Spanish reconciliation, and the most needed and effective way to do this is to grant amnesty to all political prisoners and exiles.

The movement demanding amnesty for imprisoned or exiled Spanish political prisoners has also received support from many well-known figures in Latin American countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Uruguay, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile, as well as France and Italy. Many international democratic groups have also supported this struggle of Spanish progressive democratic forces.

The Spanish Franco regime has thrown thousands of communists and other democrats into prison. These political prisoners suffer torture and abuse in prison. According to a recent report in the British "Times," more than 400 political prisoners in the notorious Burgos prison are in dire circumstances. The political prisoners demanded that they be provided with books and magazines, necessary clothing, necessary medical facilities, improved sanitation, and that they be allowed to file written complaints against the authorities' illegal atrocities. However, they were subjected to even more brutal persecution as a result.

On the eve of the Spanish National Peaceful Strike on June 18 this year, the Franco regime once again carried out a frenzied persecution of democratic forces, arresting Simon Sanchez Montero, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party. The Madrid Special Military Court, regardless of the demands of the Spanish people and the people of all countries for amnesty for political prisoners, brazenly sentenced Montero to twenty years in prison on September 25.

    西班牙共产党等进步力量发动运动
    要求大赦政治犯和流亡者
    新华社26日讯　马德里消息：西班牙共产党和其他进步力量不久前发动了一个争取“大赦被囚禁和流亡在外的政治犯”的运动。这个运动在西班牙国内外得到了广泛支持和声援。
    西班牙许多著名人士纷纷表示支持这个运动。包括各界人士在内的十七人在写给佛朗哥政府司法部长的一封信里说，他们认为，在任何方面也不能说明，数以千计的西班牙人由于被关在监狱中或者被迫流亡在国外而不能参加国家生活这一事实是合理的。他们指出，消除阻挠西班牙人和解的障碍的时候已经到了，在这方面一个最需要和最有效的办法就是对一切政治犯和流亡者实行大赦。
    要求大赦被囚禁或流亡在外的西班牙政治犯的运动还得到古巴、委内瑞拉、乌拉圭、墨西哥、阿根廷、智利等拉丁美洲国家以及法国和意大利的许多知名人士的声援。许多国际民主团体也声援西班牙进步民主力量的这个斗争。
    西班牙佛朗哥政权把数以千计的共产党人和其他民主人士投入监狱。这些政治犯在监狱中受尽折磨和虐待。据英国“泰晤士报”最近报道，在著名的布尔哥斯监狱中，四百多名政治犯处境悲惨不堪。政治犯们要求供给他们书籍杂志、必要的衣服、应有的医疗设施，改善卫生条件，并允许他们对当局的非法暴行提出书面控诉。但是他们却因此而遭到更加残酷的迫害。
    在今年6月18日西班牙全国和平大罢工的前夕，佛朗哥政权对民主力量又一次进行了疯狂的迫害，逮捕了西班牙共产党中央委员会政治局委员西蒙·桑切斯·蒙特罗。马德里特别军事法庭并且不顾西班牙人民和各国人民要求大赦政治犯的要求，悍然在9月25日判处蒙特罗二十年徒刑。
