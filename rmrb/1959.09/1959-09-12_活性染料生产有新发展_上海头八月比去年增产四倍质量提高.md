Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 10th. Reactive dyes, successfully trial-produced and put into production in Shanghai last year, have seen new developments this year. In the first eight months of this year, Shanghai's production of reactive dyes increased nearly fourfold compared to the entire year of last year. Product quality has greatly improved. Among the thirteen types of dyes comparable to foreign products, six varieties have fully reached the level of similar foreign products. Product costs have also generally decreased, some by about half compared to last year.

In the second quarter of this year, Shanghai's dye industry launched a mass movement, mobilizing workers and technicians to focus on the two key issues of product quality and variety matching for reactive dyes. For example, the fastness of Reactive Brilliant Red, one of the main varieties of reactive dyes, in terms of sun exposure, soap washing, and perspiration, already matched the British "Procion" Brilliant Red last year. However, while the British dye had a fixation rate of 46% (i.e., one hundred kilograms of dye could dye forty-six kilograms of fabric), Shanghai's reactive dye only had 25%. This meant more dye was needed, and the dyeing was not as deep. In terms of solubility, the British dye could dissolve two kilograms in one hundred kilograms of water, while Shanghai's could only dissolve half a kilogram. Insufficient dye solubility would affect the product quality of printing and dyeing factories. Under close cooperation, workers at the Runhua Dye Factory and Shanghai Dye Factory vigorously tackled this key issue. They spent more than a month, conducting over a hundred experiments using different methods, and finally found a new technological route. As a result, the fixation rate reached 59.7%, and the solubility increased to 8% (i.e., eight kilograms). After adopting the new technological route, the output also increased by about 100%. Reactive Brilliant Orange (HG), which Runhua Factory had not fully trial-produced successfully last year, has recently caught up with the Swiss "Cibacron" Brilliant Orange (G). This dye has already begun mass production in August. Other dyes such as Reactive Yellow (RN), Reactive Yellow (HR), and Reactive Brilliant Blue (AR) have also fully reached the level of similar foreign products.

Currently, the number of factories producing reactive dyes in Shanghai has increased from one (Runhua Dye Factory) last year to four, greatly increasing production capacity. In the first half of this year, in order to produce more and cheaper reactive dyes, various factories tried every means to tap the potential of their equipment and began manufacturing intermediate raw materials themselves. China Dye Factory No. 2 started producing reactive dyes in large quantities this year and felt that its equipment was insufficient. The workers put forward the slogan of "demanding new products from old equipment" and put their minds to work on the existing equipment. After repeated experiments, the workers in the red paste workshop of the first workshop shortened the production cycle of direct red paste dyes from two days to one day, freeing up three of the original five reaction pots for the production of reactive dyes. The production of Reactive Red Brown in the second workshop originally required twelve processes and seventy-two hours. Technicians and workers worked hard for three days and nights, reducing the twelve processes to five and compressing the production cycle to sixteen hours, increasing production efficiency by two times. In the first half of this year, the factory adopted these methods to produce nearly twice as much reactive dye as originally planned. Runhua Dye Factory, which was relocated and expanded last year, is currently installing new equipment while utilizing the original equipment. In August and September, it has already manufactured and is trial-producing four new reactive dyes and three intermediates for reactive dyes. Manufacturing intermediates themselves and continuously expanding production has generally reduced the factory's production costs, with Reactive Fuchsia and Reactive Brilliant Rose being 40% to 50% lower than last year.

In order to assist users in mastering the performance and usage methods of this advanced dye, Shanghai Organic Chemical Industry Company has strengthened cooperation with many printing and dyeing factories and testing institutions since the beginning of this year, continuously expanding the application range of reactive dyes. Currently, in addition to cotton cloth, silk, rayon, and tussah silk, the Chinese specialty—velvet—is also using reactive dyes. When Shanghai Velvet Factory started using reactive dyes, the quality was unstable. The Organic Chemical Industry Company sent technicians to the factory to improve the formula together with them. The color of the dyed velvet was more vivid and pleasing than when using direct dyes, and the fastness increased from the previous level of four to level six.

Reactive dyes were first successfully trial-produced by Shanghai Runhua Dye Factory in March last year. Subsequently, many factories, universities, and scientific research institutions in Shanghai and other regions actively conducted research and trial production, expanding the variety to dozens in more than half a year. In order to summarize the experience in this area, the Ministry of Chemical Industry convened a National Reactive Dye Appraisal Conference in Shanghai in April this year. Based on the development situation over the past year, the conference decided to further develop reactive dyes by improving product quality and completing the dye color spectrum. After this conference, the experimental, production, and application departments related to reactive dyes across the country also further strengthened cooperation, frequently exchanged technical information, and sent people to jointly study, which powerfully promoted the development of reactive dyes.

### 活性染料生产有新发展  上海头八月比去年增产四倍质量提高

    活性染料生产有新发展
    上海头八月比去年增产四倍质量提高
    新华社上海10日电　上海去年试制成功并投入生产的活性染料，今年又有了新的发展。今年的头八个月，上海生产的活性染料比去年全年增长将近四倍；产品质量大大提高，在可同国外相比的十三种染料中，有六个品种已经全面赶上国外同类产品的水平；产品成本也普遍下降，有些比去年降低一半左右。
    今年第二季度，上海染料工业发动工人和技术人员，针对活性染料产品质量和品种配套这两个关键，掀起了一个群众运动。例如活性染料主要品种之一的活性艳红，在日晒、皂洗、汗渍等方面的牢度，去年就赶上了英国的“普施安”艳红；而英国染料的固色率达到46％（即一百公斤染料可以有四十六公斤染上织物），上海活性染料只有25％，染料用得多，而且染不深。在溶解度方面，英国染料可以在一百公斤水中溶化两公斤，上海只能溶化半公斤。染料溶不多，会影响印染工厂的产品质量。润华染料厂和上海染料厂在密切合作下，工人们猛攻这个关键。他们花了一个多月的时间，用不同的方法作了一百多次试验，最后找到了一条新的工艺路线。结果，固色率达到了59.7％，溶解度提高到8％（即八公斤）。采用新的工艺路线生产之后，产量还提高了一倍左右。润华厂去年一直没有完全试制成功的活性艳橙（HG），最近也已经赶上瑞士“汽巴克隆”艳橙（G）。这种染料在8月份已经开始成批生产了。其他如活性黄（RN）、活性黄（HR）、活性艳蓝（AR）等，也都全面达到国外同类产品的水平。
    目前，上海生产活性染料的工厂已从去年润华染料厂一个增加到四个，生产能力大大提高。今年上半年为了生产更多更便宜的活性染料，各厂千方百计挖掘设备潜力，并且自己着手制造了中间体原料。中国染料二厂今年开始大量生产活性染料，设备感到不足。工人们提出了“向老设备要新产品”的口号，在原有设备上大动脑筋。第一车间红浆工场的工人们经过反复试验，把直接红浆染料的生产周期从两天缩短到一天，把原有的五只反应锅腾出了三只，用来生产活性染料。第二车间生产活性红棕，原来也要十二道工序和七十二小时，技术人员和工人苦战了三昼夜，把十二道工序改为五道，生产周期压缩到十六小时，生产效率提高了两倍。这个厂今年上半年就采取这些办法比原计划多生产了将近一倍的活性染料。去年迁址扩建的润华染料厂，最近一面安装新设备一面利用原有设备，在8、9两个月中已经制成和正在试制四种新的活性染料和三种活性染料的中间体。自己制造中间体和不断扩大产量，使这个厂的生产成本普遍降低，其中活性桃红和活性妃红，都比去年降低40％到50％。
    上海市有机化学工业公司为了协助使用单位掌握这种高级染料的性能和使用方法，今年以来同许多印染厂、试验机构加强了协作，不断扩大了活性染料的使用范围。目前，除了棉布、丝绸、人造棉、柞蚕丝等都已开始使用之外，连中国的特产——丝绒也在采用活性染料了。上海丝绒厂在开始用活性染料的时候，质量不稳定，有机化学工业公司派技术人员下厂同他们一道改进配方，染出来的丝绒的色泽比用直接染料时更加鲜艳悦目，牢度从过去的四级提高到六级。
    活性染料是在去年3月份上海润华染料厂最早试制成功的。接着，上海和其他地区的许多工厂、高等学校、科学试验机构，都纷纷进行研究试制，在半年多的时间，品种扩大到好几十种。为了总结这方面的经验，化学工业部今年4月份曾在上海召开了全国活性染料鉴定会议。会议根据一年来的发展情况，确定从提高产品质量和配齐染料色谱两方面，来进一步发展活性染料，这次会议以后，全国各地有关活性染料的试验、生产、使用部门，也都进一步加强协作，经常交换技术资料，互相派人共同研究，有力地推动了活性染料的发展。（附图片）
