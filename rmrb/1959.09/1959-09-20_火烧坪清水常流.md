	Do farming, but not on Huoshaoping,
	Three days without rain, carry the "Wooden Dragon" (waterwheel),
	Busy all year round,
	In the end, only two or three tenths are harvested.
	This is a folk song sung by the people in the Huoshaoping area in the past, and it is also their lament for their past life!

	In the ?Li People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, there is a Juantang Brigade, and Huoshaoping is within the boundaries of the Limin Production Team of this brigade. When we arrived at the ?Li People's Commune, the comrades of the commune Party committee suggested that we go to this place to take a look.

	The Limin Production Team has more than 2,100 mu of land, all of which is red soil with ironstone particles. Huoshaoping has also been dry and barren since ancient times, with poor harvests every year. Trees do not grow here, grass does not grow deep, let alone farming. The soil here is indeed frighteningly red, and if it is exposed to the scorching sun, it is simply a burning land. No wonder it has been called "Huoshaoping" (Burning Flatland) since the old days!

	Due to the drought, until last year, late rice had never been planted here, only early and mid-season rice. The yield of the rice planted was also very low, only one and a half tenths could be harvested; even the rice seedlings died from drought, resulting in no harvest at all.

	After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Huoshaoping waged a tenacious struggle against the drought. People opened ponds and dug wells everywhere, and the soil dug from the ponds piled up into several small mountains. During the advanced cooperative stage, drought resistance accounted for more than 40% of the total labor force throughout the year. People longed to solve the water conservancy problem and yearned for water conservancy to bring grain to Huoshaoping through natural flow. However, to build a reservoir, there was no water source nearby; even if it could be built, there would be difficulties in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources; if only ponds and wells could be opened and dug, the large and small ponds would dry up in the event of a drought, and the drought problem would still not be solved.

	Building water conservancy and overcoming drought was also the common desire of many advanced cooperatives in Gaotang Township. These desires finally converged into a grand will. Under the leadership of the Gaotang Township Party Committee, a plan was formulated to build a large reservoir. After the reservoir was built, it could store 30 million cubic meters of water and irrigate tens of thousands of mu of farmland. However, new problems arose. Building the reservoir would flood 6,000 mu of rice fields in Ganshan Township, the canal would have to pass through Changchong Township, and the project was extremely large, requiring 8,000 laborers and more than 100,000 yuan of materials, which Gaotang Township could not solve.

	The establishment of the ?Li People's Commune made it possible for the people to build a reservoir. The plan for the Zhashan Reservoir was once again brought before the commune Party committee. Gaotang Township and Changchong Township were in the same commune, and the boundary problem between the two townships was solved; the farmland belonging to Ganshan Township of Gutang Commune was also properly resolved; in this way, the grand plan to build the reservoir began to be implemented last winter.

	When the people of Huoshaoping heard that the Zhashan Reservoir was to be built, everyone was elated and everyone asked to participate. Comrade Zeng Shaoqiu, the Party branch secretary of the Limin Production Team, told us that at that time, the most people went from the Limin Production Team, accounting for more than 90% of the team's labor force. Many canteens only left a few old men and women, and some families moved to the construction site to rush to build the reservoir day and night.

	In April of this year, the Zhashan Reservoir was basically completed. Since then, more than 36,000 mu of farmland has been irrigated and freed from the threat of drought. The more than 500 mu of land in Huoshaoping has become a paddy field that cannot be burned to death and with a constant flow of water. This year, the early and mid-season rice harvests totaled more than 500,000 jin, an increase of more than 200,000 jin compared with last year. Then, more than 380 mu of late rice was planted. This was something that the farmers of Huoshaoping could not have dreamed of in the past.

	When we visited here, we heard members expressing their gratitude to the Party everywhere. Seventy-eight-year-old Li Yunquan said: "Things that I dared not think about in the past have been done today under the leadership of the Communist Party. Now our place has truly become a blessed land for producing gold and silver." Secretary Zeng led us to see Huoshaoping. The Huoshaoping in front of us was a lush green field of late rice seedlings. The water in the large and small ponds was full, and the canal water flowing through the fields flowed past our feet, clear and visible. If Secretary Zeng hadn't reminded us, we wouldn't have believed that this was the Huoshaoping where even trees couldn't grow in the past.

	On the way, we met the old farmer Li Sandie, who lived in the nursing home. It is said that Li Sandie, like other elderly people at first, did not believe that water could be diverted from the Zhashan Reservoir, which was more than ten miles away, to Huoshaoping. When the reservoir was being built, Li Sandie personally went there to see it once. This year, when the ?Li People's Commune celebrated its first anniversary, Li Sandie came to participate in the celebration meeting with a heart full of gratitude to the Party, and sang a few folk songs in the crowd to praise the Party and the people's commune. When we met this time, he couldn't control his inner joy and excitement, and sang the folk songs he usually loved to sing again: The people's commune has high plans, the Zhashan Reservoir is built well to protect the seedlings, eliminate drought and eliminate dryness, ensure a bumper harvest in the fields, and the working people are all laughing.

### 火烧坪清水常流

    火烧坪清水常流
    史合湘
    作田莫作火烧坪，
    三天不雨背“木龙”（水车），
    忙忙碌碌搞一年，
    到头不过两三成。
    这是火烧坪一带人民过去唱的一支歌谣，也是他们对于过去生活的一种悲叹！
    湖南长沙县?梨人民公社有个卷塘大队，火烧坪就在这个大队的利民生产队界内。我们一到?梨公社的时候，公社党委会的同志们都建议我们到这个地方去看看。
    利民生产队有二千一百多亩土地，都是红壤、铁石粒子的土。火烧坪也是自古干旱，土地贫瘠，年年欠收。这里种树树不长，长草草不深，更不用说作田了。这里的土的确红得怕人，若是烈日当头一晒，它简直就是一片燃烧着的土地。怨不得这里从老辈子起就叫它作“火烧坪”！
    由于干旱，到去年为止，这里从来没有插过晚稻，只能插早、中稻。插下去的产量也很低，只能收一成半；甚至禾苗干旱而死，颗粒无收。
    解放后，火烧坪的人民在党的领导下和干旱进行了顽强的斗争。人们到处开塘、挖井，光挖塘的土就堆成了几座小山。高级社时，抗旱所用的工占全年总劳动量的40％以上。人们渴望着解决水利问题，向往着水利自流化给火烧坪带来粮食。但是，要修水库，附近没有水源；即或能修的话，人力、物力、财力都有困难；如果还是只能开塘、挖井，干旱起来大塘小塘都干得见底，干旱问题仍然不能解决。
    兴修水利，战胜干旱，也是高塘乡许多高级社的共同愿望。这些愿望终于汇集成了一个宏大的意志，在高塘乡党委领导下，制订了一个兴修大水库的规划，水库修成后，能够蓄水三千万立方，可灌溉几万亩田地。但是，新的问题又出现了。修水库会淹没干杉乡的六千亩稻田，渠道要经过长冲乡，同时工程极大，需要八千个劳动力和十几万元的物资，这对于高塘乡来说，是没法解决的。
    ?梨公社的成立给人民兴修水库的愿望带来了可能，榨山水库的计划在公社党委的面前又提了出来。高塘乡与长冲乡同在一个公社，两个乡的地界问题解决了；属于谷塘公社的干杉乡的田地，也作了妥善的解决；这样，修建水库的宏伟计划就在去冬开始动工了。
    火烧坪的人们听说要修榨山水库，个个兴高彩烈，人人要求参加。利民生产队党支部书记曾绍裘同志告诉我们，那时候利民生产队去的人最多，占全队劳动力的90％以上，许多食堂只留下几个老倌和老婆婆，有的全家都搬到工地，日夜不停地抢修水库。
    今年4月，榨山水库基本完工了。从此，三万六千多亩田得到了灌溉，摆脱了干旱的威胁。火烧坪的五百多亩地变成了火烧不死、水流不绝的水田，今年早中稻共收五十多万斤，比去年多打二十万斤。接着又插了三百八十多亩晚稻。这对于火烧坪的农民来说，过去连做梦也想不到的。
    我们访问这里的时候，到处都听到社员对党的感激。七十八岁的李运泉说：“过去，想也不敢想的事，今天在共产党的领导下做出来了。如今我们这里真正变成了出金出银的福地。”曾支书领我们去看火烧坪，眼前的火烧坪是一片茁壮的绿油油的晚稻禾苗，大塘、小塘的水都满满的，纵横田间的渠水潺潺地从我们的脚旁流过，一眼望去，清澈见底。要不是曾支书提醒我们，我们真不会相信这里就是过去连树木都不生长的火烧坪。
    路上，我们遇见了住在敬老院的老农李三爹。据说，李三爹最初和其他老年人一样，不相信能从十几里以外的榨山水库引水到火烧坪来，在修水库的时候，李三爹还亲自跑到那里看过一次。今年?梨公社成立一周年时，李三爹怀着万分感激党的心情来参加庆祝大会，在人群中间唱了几支山歌，来歌颂党，歌颂人民公社。这次和我们见面，他也控制不住内心的愉快和兴奋，又唱起他平素爱唱的山歌：人民公社计划高，修好榨山水库保禾苗，除掉干来除掉旱，保住田里大丰产，劳动人民齐欢笑。
