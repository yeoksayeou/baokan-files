Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: On the ninth day of the First National Games, eighty-four athletes in track and field, shooting, radio, and model boat racing broke six national records, and three athletes surpassed one international best performance from 1958.

In the track and field competition, which is drawing to a close, six athletes broke three national records today in the men's triple jump, 400-meter hurdles, and pentathlon. The Beijing and Hubei relay teams both tied the national record for the men's 400-meter relay.

So far, twenty-seven athletes have broken sixteen national track and field records in the past nine days.

Shandong athlete Tian Zhaozhong created a national best performance of 15.82 meters in today's triple jump competition (the national record is 15.65 meters). The winner of the men's pentathlon was Wang Furong, a 24-year-old student from Shandong University, who broke the national record of 2,721 points held by People's Liberation Army athlete Li Menglin with a score of 3,121 points.
