    To increase the country's oil production and offer a generous gift to National Day
    Sichuan Cultivates "Oilseed Rape Kings"
    Urban and rural people, government organizations, and schools universally utilize scattered idle land, striving for each person to cultivate five to ten plants well.
    (Our report) Sichuan Province is carrying out a mass movement of thousands of households mobilizing and tens of thousands of people acting to cultivate "Oilseed Rape Kings" (large rape plants). They are utilizing all available scattered land such as in front of and behind houses, field edges, land corners, hillside wastelands, roadsides, and watersides, as well as gardens, nurseries, and so on, to cultivate "Oilseed Rape Kings," increase oil production, and offer gifts to National Day.
    In recent years, in order to rapidly increase oil production and meet the growing needs of national construction and people's lives, various special districts, counties, and people's communes in Sichuan Province, in addition to appropriately expanding the oil crop planting area within the communes and striving to increase yield per unit area, some regions have mobilized the masses to utilize all available scattered idle land to plant oil crops and vigorously cultivate "Oilseed Rape Kings" to increase oil production, achieving significant results. The people of Zhong County, who pioneered the successful cultivation of "Oilseed Rape Kings," successfully cultivated more than 900,000 "Oilseed Rape Kings" last winter and this spring, utilizing idle scattered land. This produced more than 234,000 catties of rapeseed, which is more than the total rapeseed output of the county in the first year of the first Five-Year Plan and is equivalent to about 32% of the county's total rapeseed output this year. Among them, there were 490 plants that produced more than three catties each, and three plants that produced more than ten catties each. The Hongguang People's Commune in Pi County cultivated large-stalk rapeseed kings last winter and this spring, with an average yield of about one catty per plant.
    Planting "Oilseed Rape Kings" has a history of more than four years in Sichuan Province, and many farmers generally have planting experience. To this end, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture issued a notice to the entire province on the 16th, requiring urban and rural people and all government organizations and schools to universally utilize idle scattered land to cultivate five to ten oilseed rape kings per person. Whoever plants it gets to keep the harvest, increasing oil production in many ways. It is estimated that after the province achieves this goal, calculated based on a population of 70 million, if each person plants ten plants, and each plant produces one catty of rapeseed, the total output would be equivalent to more than 140% of the province's total rapeseed output last year.
    A mass movement to cultivate oilseed rape kings, from rural to urban areas, is being carried out vigorously in major and minor cities and people's communes throughout the province. The people's communes in Zhong County, known for their skill in cultivating oilseed rape kings, have adopted methods of assigning tasks at each level, leading cadres taking the lead in planting, and short-term intensive efforts to powerfully promote the movement to plant oilseed rape kings. Liu Yuansheng, deputy secretary of the Shiru District Party Committee, stated at a cadre meeting that he would plant thirteen plants, and sixteen cadres went back and planted more than three hundred plants that night. Driven by the cadres, more than 110,000 oilseed rape kings were planted in the entire district within a few days. All members of the Huaqiao People's Commune in Bashan District launched an intensive effort for three mornings and one evening, planting more than 500,000 oilseed rape kings, an average of more than twenty plants per household. To date, the county has utilized scattered land to plant more than 660,000 "Oilseed Rape Kings." Government organizations, enterprises, factories, mines, schools, troops, communes, and street residents in Chongqing have formulated plans, gathered momentum, and deeply cultivated the land, determined to make the mountain city fragrant with rape flowers all over the city next spring. Many units have quickly prepared the soil and cultivated seedlings. Cadres of the Neijiang Prefectural Party Committee of the CPC have sown rapeseed around their residences that can be planted on the equivalent of eighteen mu of land.
    Currently, it is the rapeseed sowing season. After the Department of Agriculture issued the notice on the mass planting of oilseed rape kings, the people of the province have listed planting "Oilseed Rape Kings" as an important part of their unit's campaign to increase production and practice economy. In order to ensure that everyone plants oilseed rape kings, people's communes are helping commune members solve problems such as seeds and fertilizers. Relevant departments are also making overall arrangements for the seeds needed in towns and cities and are actively helping to solve the problems. (Attached photo)

### 为国家增产油料向国庆献出厚礼  四川人人培植“油菜王”  城乡人民和机关团体学校普遍利用零星闲地，争取每人种好五至十株

    为国家增产油料向国庆献出厚礼
    四川人人培植“油菜王”
    城乡人民和机关团体学校普遍利用零星闲地，争取每人种好五至十株 
    本报讯　四川省开展千家动员、万人动手的全民培植“油菜王”（大株油菜）运动，利用屋前屋后、田边地角、坎坡荒地、路旁水边，以及花园、苗圃等一切可以利用的零星土地，培植“油菜王”，增加油料生产，向国庆献礼。
    几年来，为了迅速增加油料生产，满足国家建设和人民生活日益增长的需要，四川省各专区、县、人民公社，除了在公社内适当扩大油料播种面积，努力提高单位面积产量外，部分地区曾发动群众利用一切可以利用的零星闲散土地种植油料作物，大力培植“油菜王”，增加油料生产，获得显著成绩。首创培植“油菜王”获得成功的忠县人民，去冬今春利用闲散零星土地培植成功的“油菜王”有九十多万株，共产油菜子二十三万四千多斤，比第一个五年计划第一年全县油菜子总产量还多，相当于今年全县油菜子总产量的32％左右。其中每株产三斤以上的有四百九十株，产十斤以上的有三株。郫县红光人民公社，去冬今春培植大株油菜王，平均每株产量达到一斤左右。
    种植“油菜王”在四川省已有四年多历史，很多农民一般都有种植经验。为此，四川省农业厅在16日向全省发出通知，要求城乡人民和各机关团体学校普遍利用闲散零星土地，每人培植五至十株油菜王，谁种谁收，从多方面增加油料生产。预计全省实现这个要求后，按全省七千万人口计算，如果每人种十株，每株产一斤菜子，总产量就相当于去年全省油菜子总产量的140％以上。
    一个从乡村到城市的全民培植油菜王运动，正在各大中小城市和各地人民公社中轰轰烈烈的开展起来。以善于培植油菜王著称的忠县各人民公社，采取层层分配任务，干部带头种植，短期突击的方式，有力地推动了种植油菜王的运动。石汝区委副书记刘远生在一次干部会上表示要种植十三株，十六个干部当晚回去就种了三百多株。在干部带动下，全区几天内就种植了油菜王十一万多株。拔山区花桥人民公社全体社员突击三个早晨和一个晚上，即种油菜王五十万多株，平均每户达二十余株。全县到目前为止，已利用零星土地种植了六十六万多株“油菜王”。重庆市各机关、企业、厂矿、学校、部队、公社、街道居民，纷纷制定规划，鼓足干劲，深挖土地，决心要山城在明年春天菜花遍地满城香，许多单位都很快做好了培土育苗工作。中共内江地委机关干部在住地周围已播种了可栽相当于十八亩田的油菜种子。
    目前，正是油菜播种季节，在农业厅发出全民种植油菜王通知后，全省人民已把种好“油菜王”列为本单位增产节约运动中的一项重要内容。为了使人人都种上油菜王，各人民公社正在帮助社员解决种子、肥料等问题。城镇所需的种子，有关部门也正在统筹安排，积极帮助解决。（附图片）
