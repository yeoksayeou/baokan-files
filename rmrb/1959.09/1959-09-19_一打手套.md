    A Dozen Gloves
    Cao Zhongyi
    As soon as Zhao, a worker in the crane team, arrived at work, Team Leader Chen approached him with a brand-new pair of white gloves.
    "Got these for you," Old Chen said, looking at Zhao's thick hands as he handed him the new gloves.
    "I don't want them," Zhao pushed them back.
    "Why? These are for labor protection. How can you..."
    Before Old Chen could finish, Zhao interrupted, "I don't want them this month, next month, or any time this year." With that, he took out a stack of new gloves tightly bound with a red string from his bag. He handed them to Old Chen and said jokingly, "Here you go, Captain, just a small token."
    Old Chen took the stack of gloves, stunned for a moment before realizing, "Zhao, you've saved so many gloves; you really deserve a commendation!"
    "It's nothing, nothing. It's all thanks to my old lady." Zhao paused, then continued, "I even got criticized by my old lady for this glove business!"
    "Why?"
    It happened last winter. Zhao was at work, switching his old gloves for the newly issued ones, and putting the old ones at home. When he got home from work in the evening, he was about to pick up a wine bottle when his wife suddenly snatched it away, "You're not allowed to drink today."
    "Why?" Zhao asked, puzzled.
    "You've done something wrong." Zhao's wife went into the inner room, brought something out, and placed it angrily in front of Zhao. Zhao looked, and it was the pair of old, discarded gloves he had left behind when he went to work that morning. Now, they had been washed clean by his wife. The holes in the fingers were reinforced with three layers of white cloth, neatly and sturdily repaired, and looked even more durable than new gloves. Zhao picked up the repaired gloves and breathed a sigh of relief, saying, "This little thing... I really didn't think..."
    "A little thing! Isn't this also wasteful?" Zhao's wife was still serious.
    "I mean, I was too careless, I..."
    "You, a fine 'Old Huang Zhong,' even made it onto the honor roll!" Zhao's wife saw that Zhao had admitted his mistake and chuckled, handing the wine bottle back to Zhao. Zhao was about to take the bottle when his wife pulled her hand back, "Wait, wear these old gloves to work tomorrow and leave the new gloves behind."
    "Don't worry, I'll do it."
    From then on, Zhao saved the new gloves; the old gloves were patched and repaired again and again until they were unusable. This way, one pair of gloves lasted as long as three or four pairs. In less than ten months, he saved a dozen gloves. Following his wife's suggestion, he tied up the dozen saved new gloves with a red string and handed them over to the public.

    一打手套
    曹中义
    起重队赵师傅刚上班，就碰上队长老陈拿着一副崭新的白手套向他走来。
    “给你领的。”老陈看了看赵师傅粗壮的双手，把那副崭新的手套递给他。
    “我不要。”赵师傅用手推了过去。
    “为什么？这是劳动保护用的呀，没有手套怎么能够……”
    老陈话还没说完，赵师傅就接着说了：“我不但这个月不要，下个月也不要，今年内也不要。”说罢从挎包里拿出一叠用一根红绳捆得扎扎实实的新手套来。他双手递给老陈开玩笑似的说：“队长，拿着吧，这只是一点小意思。”
    老陈接着这叠手套，呆了一下才愰然大悟：“赵师傅，你节约了这么多手套，真该给你记上一功啊！”
    “小意思，小意思。这都是我老伴的功劳。”赵师傅停了一下，又说下去：“为了手套这事，我还挨过老伴批评呢！”
    “为什么？”
    这还是去年冬天的事。赵师傅上班把旧手套换上新领来的手套，旧的放到家中。晚上下班回来，正拿着酒瓶要喝酒，赵师母猛然伸手夺下酒瓶：“今天罚你不喝酒。”
    “为啥？”赵师傅莫名其妙地问道。
    “你有错。”赵师母走到里间拿了一件东西又出来。
    “我有什么错，下班的时候支部书记还表扬我人老志气高赛过‘老黄忠’呢。”赵师傅很不服气。
    “可就是有点浪费。”赵师母把手中的东西生气地放到赵师傅面前。赵师傅一看，原来是早上上班时丢下的那副已经报废了的旧手套，现在它被老伴洗得干干净净，指头破的地方用三层白布补得结结实实，整整齐齐的，看起来比新手套还耐用呢。赵师傅拿起补好的手套，这才舒了口气说：“这小事……我真没想到……”
    “小事！这不也是浪费么？”赵师母还是那样一本正经的。
    “我是说我太马虎了，我……”
    “你，好一个‘老黄忠’，还上过光荣榜呢。”赵师母看到赵师傅认错了，噗嗤一声笑了起来，把酒瓶又递给赵师傅，赵师傅正要接酒瓶，赵师母又把拿着酒瓶的手缩回来：“等等，明天上班戴上这副旧手套，把新手套留下来。”
    “你放心，我一定照办。”
    从此，赵师傅把新手套存下来；旧手套一补再补，直到实在没法补的时候才不用，这样一副手套抵上三、四副用，不到十个月就省下一打手套，按照老伴的意思，用红绳把这一打节省下来的新手套捆好了交给公家。
