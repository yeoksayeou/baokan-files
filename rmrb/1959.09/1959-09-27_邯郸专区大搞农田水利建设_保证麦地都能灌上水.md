According to the Hebei Daily, the people's communes in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, are vigorously developing farmland water conservancy construction, determined to plant wheat in irrigated land and strive for a greater bumper harvest next summer.

Handan Prefecture plans to plant nine million mu of wheat this autumn, with a planned output to double the actual output of this year. The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that to achieve this leap forward plan, the first thing is to ensure that wheat is planted in irrigated land. Therefore, it was decided to launch a farmland water conservancy construction campaign quickly while doing a good job in the "three autumns" work. All localities have conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Prefectural Committee. In order to solve the contradiction of large current tasks and insufficient labor, the people's communes have scientifically arranged labor, adopted the method of dividing battle lines, organizing professional farmland water conservancy construction teams, and combining it with a vigorous mass movement. The Minyou Canal dredging project, one of the key projects, was originally scheduled to be completed by October 5. In order to bring the project into effect earlier, Ci County, Quzhou, Julu, Yongnian and other four counties mobilized more than 20,000 laborers to launch a high-efficiency competition. From September 5 to 12, they completed more than 40% of the entire project. It is estimated that the entire expansion plan can be fully realized by the end of September. After the expansion of this canal, it is expected to irrigate more than one million mu of wheat fields. Baming and other six communes in Nangong County, which have not been able to guarantee a good wheat harvest due to drought in previous years, have extracted more than 30,000 people to invest in the construction of the Minxing Canal. More than 120 li of canals have been dug, and more than 200,000 mu of land has been irrigated. After the completion of the entire project, 1.2 million mu of dry land can be turned into paddy fields.

As of September 15, the entire prefecture had dredged 379 main and branch canals, washed nearly a thousand machine wells, and more than 200 new machine wells are being drilled; 23 new and expanded canals, with a total length of more than 60,000 meters; In addition, six large and medium-sized reservoirs, including Yuecheng and Mahe, are also continuing to be constructed or are preparing to be constructed.

During this large-scale farmland water conservancy project, the county party committees and commune party committees of all counties were led by the secretaries, who went deep into the front line to specifically guide the water conservancy construction movement. Cadres at all levels went deep into the construction sites, ate, lived, and labored with the masses, brainstormed ideas together, carried out tool reforms and technological innovations, and launched a high-efficiency movement. Most construction sites have achieved cart transportation of soil and rocks.

At present, the water conservancy construction army in various places is continuing to fight, and it is necessary to basically complete the water conservancy of 9 million mu of wheat fields by the end of September.

    邯郸专区大搞农田水利建设
    保证麦地都能灌上水
    据河北日报消息　河北邯郸专区各人民公社正在大搞农田水利建设，决心把小麦种在水地上，争取明年夏季更大丰收。
    邯郸专区计划秋种小麦九百万亩，计划产量要比今年实产量翻一番。中共邯郸地委认为，实现这个跃进计划，首先要保证把小麦种在水地上。因此，决定在做好“三秋”工作的同时，迅速掀起一个农田水利建设运动。各地都认真执行了地委的指示。为了解决当前任务大、劳动力不足的矛盾，各人民公社都科学地安排了劳动力，采取了划分战线、组织农田水利建设专业队和大搞群众运动相结合的办法。重点工程之一的民有渠疏浚工程，原计划到10月5日完工，为了提早发挥工程效益，磁县、曲周、巨鹿、永年等四个县动员了两万多名民工，展开了高工效竞赛，从9月5日到12日，就完成全部工程的40％多，预计到9月底即可全部实现扩建计划。这一条渠道扩建后，预计能多浇一百多万亩麦地。历年因干旱不能保证小麦丰收的南宫县坝营等六个公社，共抽出三万多人，投入修建民兴渠的工程。现已挖渠一百二十多里长，浇地二十多万亩，工程全部完成后，可使一百二十万亩旱地变为水田。
    全专区到9月15日，已疏浚干、支渠道三百七十九条，机井掏沙近千眼，正在新打的机井还有二百多眼；新开和扩建渠道二十三条，长达六万多米；另外，岳城、马河等六座大中型水库也正在继续动工或准备动工。
    在这次大修农田水利工程中，各县县委和公社党委都由书记挂帅，深入第一线，具体指导水利建设运动。各级干部都深入工地，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、共同想办法，大搞工具改革和技术革新，开展高工效运动，大部分工地都做到了运土运石车子化。
    现在，各地水利建设大军正继续战斗，要在9月底基本完成九百万亩麦田的水利化。
