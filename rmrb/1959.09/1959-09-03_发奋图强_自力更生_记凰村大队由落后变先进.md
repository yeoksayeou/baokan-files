    Strive for Progress, Rely on Our Own Efforts
    A Record of Huangcun Brigade's Transformation from Backward to Advanced
    Party Secretary Settles in a Backward Team
    On the third day of the Spring Festival in 1959, while the festive atmosphere still enveloped Guitou Commune in Lechang County, Guangdong, the Party Secretary, Wen Zexiang, went to settle in Huangcun Brigade.
    Huangcun had been known for its backwardness ever since the land reform. Since the cooperativization in 1956, although production had increased year by year, the increase was not significant, with the unit area yield only increasing by twenty-four catties in several years, far behind other cooperatives.
    In the first spring after communization, the Guitou Commune Party Committee decided to change the backward state of Huangcun Brigade. Wen Zexiang, who had been a farmhand for landlords in Huangcun before liberation, actively requested to return to Huangcun Brigade, determined to change its backward state together with the masses. Considering that he was a cadre born and raised in Huangcun and had great determination, the Party Committee agreed to his request, allowing him to concurrently serve as the Party Branch Secretary of Huangcun Brigade.
    Although Wen Zexiang was well aware of Huangcun's backward state, he was not sure what the root cause of the backwardness was.
    Wen Zexiang visited households one by one, chatting here and there, and talking heart-to-heart with many people. He felt that everyone had a strong desire to change the backward situation. The masses said, "People fight for pride, Buddha fights for incense; who wants to be backward!", "People have faces, trees have bark; Huangcun can't be at the tail end again this year." But would it be possible to change the backward state? When the member Hou Heyang talked about this issue, he said, "Speaking of it, we shouldn't be backward. In terms of conditions, Huangcun has relatively abundant water sources, rich fertilizer sources, and the soil quality is not too bad. Speaking of cultivation, Huangcun people are particular about farming. In the past, people in Daqi Ridge said that we weed so well that even footprints can't be seen." But why is it always backward? Hou Heyang said, "We have a lot of land but few laborers. Each person cultivates ten mu of land, and most of the land is far from the village, requiring a walk of seven or eight li or even ten li. How much time is wasted walking back and forth for three meals a day! Huangcun's backward work and low yield are due to these distant and backward fields."
    Wen Zexiang reflected the opinions of the masses to the Party Branch. The branch held a meeting to study the matter, believing that to change the backward state of Huangcun, it was necessary to mobilize all cadres and the masses, carry forward the spirit of hard work, clever work, and practical work, and conquer the distant fields and transform the backward fields by setting up camps in the fields. At the same time, it put forward the "five transformations" slogan: turning distant fields into nearby fields, low yield into high yield, poor teams into rich teams, backward into advanced, and carrying poles into carts. When the Party Branch presented these decisions to the members' representative meeting for discussion, everyone was extremely happy. The masses said, "For many years, fertilizers have been going the wrong way: when accumulating fertilizer, we carry it back to the village from outside, and when applying fertilizer, we carry it from the village to the field, which is exhausting. The Party's idea is good. Setting up camps in the fields, accumulating fertilizer on the spot and applying it on the spot, increasing production relies on this method, and Huangcun's non-backwardness also relies on this method." Chen Jiabin, the first squad leader, and the members' representatives calculated that, based on an average distance of seven li from the village to all the fields in the team, each person could only deliver six loads of fertilizer to the fields each day. Moving to the fields would allow them to deliver more than thirty loads of fertilizer, increasing labor efficiency many times! In addition, members going to work and returning from work had to travel four times a day, totaling three hours, and all sixty-six laborers in the team spent two hundred hours of ineffective labor time a day, which was equivalent to losing twenty-five laborers. If half of the people camped in the fields, the distance would be shortened to two or three li, then labor efficiency could be increased by at least 10%. Everyone was moved by this calculation. Hou Heyang also suggested "carrying a load of manure when going to work, and a load of grass (for bedding in the livestock pen) when returning to the village," so that they would not have empty shoulders or empty hands when walking. This is what he used to do when he cultivated distant fields; his wife did the same when delivering meals to the fields. These opinions were accepted by everyone.
    The Boiling Huangcun
    The members' representatives brought the decisions of the meeting to the masses, and the "five transformations" excited the people of Huangcun. The entire brigade was boiling. Everyone carried pots, bowls, chopsticks, luggage, drove livestock, and brought poultry to the fields. Most of the labor force in the entire brigade moved to the fields to set up camps. They set up fifteen camps in various fields, with more than one hundred and twenty people living there from the start of plowing to the time when the rice ripened.
    After moving to the fields, the members carried forward the spirit of hard work and mutual assistance. If there were not enough quilts, everyone would adjust and borrow from each other, or squeeze under the same quilt to get through many cold spring nights. When midsummer came, if there were not enough mosquito nets, some members would hide in the sandwiched quilt covers – to prevent mosquitoes and keep warm. Although there were many inconveniences in life, everyone was not afraid of hardship in order to change the backward situation.
    In the half-year of fighting in the fields, the cadres fulfilled the Party Branch's call for "fighting together," always eating, living, and working with the members in the fields, and becoming vanguards in breaking through the highest quotas on the labor front. During the preparation for plowing and accumulating fertilizer, the daily quota for cutting grass was 900 catties, 1,200 catties, and 1,400 catties. However, Song Weiqiang, who was transferred from the commune to serve as the deputy brigade leader, always exceeded 1,400 catties. During the spring plowing, Secretary Wen Zexiang heard that the fourth team, which was usually the most backward, reported that no one had broken through the highest quota of planting one and a half mu per day, so he came to this team and challenged the squad leader Hou Dingcai to a rice planting competition. Hou Dingcai got energized and started competing with Wen Zexiang from five o'clock in the morning the next day, planting until seven o'clock in the evening. Wen Zexiang planted one mu and five fen and five li of land, breaking through the highest quota, while Hou Dingcai planted even more, reaching two mu and two li. The news that the secretary and the squad leader competed in rice planting and broke the quota spread throughout the fields, boosting the morale of the members. The next day, among the sixty-two laborers in the entire team, eighteen exceeded the quota of planting one and a half mu per day.
              Won the Red Flag Three Times
    Before the harvest, cadres and the masses were already sharing the joy of victory gained through their joint hard work. During the early rice production period, the commune organized three field appraisals, and the mobile red flag was planted in Huangcun Brigade three times. When the red flag was first planted in the fields of Huangcun, which was previously considered old and backward, the excitement of the masses was indescribable. That day, after winning the red flag, Mo Decai, the deputy secretary of the Party Branch, went to the fields to plant middle rice with the members and told everyone the exciting news. Five or six members present laughed together, saying that Secretary Mo was joking, how could the red flag be planted in Huangcun? Member Huang Xiancai said, "Huangcun not being at the tail end is already first place. Which year has Huangcun's production not been criticized!" Mo Decai said, "I'm not lying to you, the red flag has really been brought, and it's planted in Yaqian!" Member He Chunfu saw that Mo Decai was serious, his heart moved, he put down the seedlings and ran to the high ground to see. From a distance, he saw a dazzling red flag fluttering in the wind on the fields of Yaqian Maoliao! "Ah! The red flag! Come and see!" With a call, everyone straightened up and ran over. After seeing the red flag, everyone felt clear in their hearts, and the rice planting became more energetic. At dinner time, everyone did not stop. In the evening, the brigade held a swearing-in meeting to protect the red flag. The Party Branch called on the members not to be complacent, to resolutely keep the red flag, and put forward the combat task of "launching a five-day assault to brew fertilizer into the fields." Brewing fertilizer is Huangcun's original advanced fertilization experience. The method is to bury the fine fertilizer in the soil between the rice plants, which saves fertilizer and improves fertilizer efficiency. Although dense planting has increased some difficulties in the brewing fertilizer work this year, the area and amount of fertilizer used in brewing this year have greatly increased. All the fields brewed the first fertilizer, and the area of the second brewing fertilizer accounted for 30%, and the amount of fertilizer brewed per mu increased from 20 loads in the past to 28 loads, so that the rice seedlings remained dark green and strong throughout the entire growth period, without mid-term yellowing and early lodging. Because the rice seedlings grew well, the red flag remained firmly planted in Huangcun during the second appraisal. The third appraisal focused on the accumulation of late rice fertilizer. On the day the Commune Party Committee issued the call, Huangcun Brigade set off a nationwide upsurge in fertilizer accumulation, which was faster than other brigades. During the appraisal, each brigade accumulated about 30 loads of fertilizer per mu, while Huangcun Brigade won the red flag again with a score of 49 loads. The mobile red flag did not move, but was firmly planted in the Huangcun fields, fluttering in the wind.
                  Extraordinary Harvest
    This year is an extraordinary harvest! During the summer harvest, golden rice, like mountains, piled up in the fields, squeezing out the place where the members slept. People simply slept on the piles of grain. The result of this harvest: a yield of 386 catties per mu, an increase of 46% over last year; a total output of 594,010 catties, an increase of 41% over last year. Huangcun, which had fought hard for half a year, achieved an extraordinary leap in production!
    Today, Huangcun has become a learning model for major brigades. During the summer planting, in order to achieve the goal of 600 catties per mu for late rice and 1,000 catties per mu for the whole year, cadres and the masses of Huangcun are working hard day and night in the fields. The belief that late rice will surpass early rice and the belief that the yield will be 1,000 catties per mu have been firmly grasped by the masses, and the masses have burst out with full and conscious labor enthusiasm. Such things often happen in the summer planting: the cadres and the masses live together in the field camps. When the cadres come back from work in the evening, they often don't see the members coming back to sleep. It turns out that they are working at night. The cadres didn't know anything about such things beforehand. For example, the team set the cultivation specifications as one plowing, two harrows, and one roller, but the masses, fearing that they would not reach the yield of 600 catties, automatically added two harrows and one roller. About 70% of the fields are processed in this way beyond the quota. What about the quality? Last year, with the support of others for 3,000 workdays, the rice was still not transplanted until eleven days after the "Beginning of Autumn," while this year, without the support of other places, the summer planting was completed five days before the "Beginning of Autumn."

    发奋图强　自力更生
    记凰村大队由落后变先进
    党委书记到落后队落户
    今年春节的大年初三，节日的气氛还笼罩着广东乐昌县桂头公社，党委书记温则湘便到凰村大队落户去了。
    凰村，从土地改革以来就以落后出了名。1956年合作化以来，虽然也是一年比一年增产，但是增产的幅度不大，单位面积产量几年来才增加了二十四斤，远远落在其他合作社的后面。
    公社化后的第一个春天，桂头公社党委会就决定要改变凰村大队的落后面貌。解放前曾经在凰村给地主当过长工的温则湘，积极请求回到凰村大队去，决心和群众一道改变凰村的落后面貌。党委会考虑到他是凰村土生土长的干部，决心又大，便同意了他的请求，让他到凰村大队兼任党总支书记。
    温则湘虽然深知凰村的落后状况，但是落后的根本原因是什么？他还摸不准。
    温则湘挨户访问，这里谈谈，那里聊聊，和不少群众谈了心。他感到大家都有着一股改变落后面貌的强烈愿望。群众说：“人争一口气，佛争一炉香，谁个甘当落后啊！”，“人有面，树有皮，今年凰村再不能把尾了。”到底能不能够改变落后面貌呢？社员侯河养谈到这个问题的时候说：“讲起来，我们是不应该落后的。论条件，凰村水源比较充足，肥源丰富，土质也不算太差；讲耕作，凰村人耕田是有考究的，过去大企岭的人都说，我们耘田连脚迹也看不到。”但是，为什么老是落后呢？侯河养说：“我们田多劳动力少，每人耕有十亩田，而且土地大部分离村很远，动不动就要走七、八里甚至十来里路。一日吃三餐，来回走路耽误了多少工夫啊！凰村工作落后，产量低，就是给这些远田、落后田累着。”
    温则湘把群众的意见反映到党总支。总支开会作了研究，认为要改变凰村的落后面貌，必须动员全体干部和群众，发扬苦干、巧干、实干的精神，用田头扎寨的办法征服远田，改造落后田。同时提出了远田变近田、低产变高产、穷队变富队、落后变先进、担杆变车子的“五变”口号。党总支把这些决定交到社员代表大会讨论的时候，大家都高兴极了。群众说：“多少年来肥料都是走倒路：积肥的时候从外面把肥料挑回村里来，施肥的时候又从村里挑到田里去，辛苦的要死。党的主意好，田头扎寨，就地积肥就地施，增产就靠这个办法，要凰村不落后也靠这个办法。”第一小队长陈家彬和社员代表们算了这样一笔账：以全队的田平均离村七里的路程来计算，每人每天只能够送六担肥下田；搬出田头住，可以送肥三十多担，劳动效率提高多少倍呀！另外，社员出工、收工，一天要来回四次，共走三个钟头路，全队六十六个劳动力，一天就花去了二百个无效工时，等于少了二十五个劳动力。如果有一半人到田头扎寨，路程缩短到两三里，那么，劳动效率起码可以提高10％。这一笔账算得大家心都动起来了。侯河养还向大家提出“出工一担粪，回村一担草（垫畜栏的）”，做到走路不空肩、不空手。原来他以前耕远田就是这么做的；他妻子送饭到田头的时候，也这么做。这些意见，都被大家接受了。
              沸腾的凰村
    社员代表把大会的决定带到群众中去，“五变”激动着凰村人的心，全大队都沸腾起来了。大家挑着锅头、碗筷、行李，赶畜带禽，开往田头。全大队的劳动力，搬到田头扎寨的占了一大半。他们在各个田垌里，扎下十五处寮寨，一百二十多人从备耕起，一直住到禾熟弯腰的时候。
    住到田头以后，社员们发扬了艰苦互助的精神。被子不够，大家就互相调剂借用，或者是挤着同被共盖，度过许多春寒之夜。仲夏来临，蚊帐不够，有的社员就躲进夹被套子里去——防蚊又御寒。生活虽然有许多不便，但是大家为着改变落后面貌，都不怕吃苦。
    半年的田头鏖战，干部们实现了党总支提出的“共同苦战”的号召，始终和社员们在田头同吃、同住、同劳动，并且在劳动战线上成为突破最高定额的尖兵。备耕积肥的时候，每日割草的定额是九百斤、一千二百斤、一千四百斤三种。但是，从公社下放来当副大队长的宋维强，却总是超过一千四百斤。春耕的时候，温则湘书记听到往常最落后的第四小队反映，没有人突破日插一亩半这个最高定额，他便到这个小队来，向小队长侯丁财提出插秧竞赛的挑战。侯丁财劲头一起来，第二天从清晨五时起便和温则湘较量开了，一直插到傍晚七时，温则湘插了一亩五分五厘田，突破了最高定额，而侯丁财插得更多，达到二亩零二厘。书记和小队长比赛插秧突破定额的消息，传遍田野，鼓舞了社员的干劲。第二天，全小队六十二个劳动力中，超过了日插一亩半定额的就有十八个人。
              三次夺得红旗
    还没到丰收的时候，干部和群众就早已经分享着共同苦战所获得的胜利愉快了。早造生产期间，公社组织了三次田间评比，流动红旗三次都插在凰村大队里。当红旗第一次插在过去被认为老落后的凰村田头上时，群众兴高采烈的情景是莫可名状的。那天，评得红旗以后，党总支部副书记莫德才到田间去和社员插植中造禾，并且把这个令人兴奋的消息告诉大家。在场的五、六个社员听了，一齐笑起来，都说莫书记会开玩笑，红旗怎么会插到凰村来呢？社员黄贤才说：“凰村不把尾就算第一了，凰村生产哪一年不受批评啊！”莫德才说：“不骗你们，红旗真的扛来了，插在遥前那里！”社员何春福见莫德才说得认真，心动了，放下秧苗跑到高地上去看，远远望见遥前茅寮的田头上，插着一面迎风飘忽的耀眼的红旗！“啊！红旗！快上来看呀！”一招呼，大家都直起腰来奔过去。看过红旗，大家心里都亮堂堂的，插秧越插越起劲。到吃晚饭的时候，大家还不住手。晚上大队开了一个保红旗的誓师大会，党总支部号召社员们不要自满，坚决把红旗保住，并且提出“突击五天，把肥料酿到田里去”的战斗任务。酿肥，是凰村原有的先进施肥经验，办法是把精肥埋到禾科间的泥土中，既节省肥料，又提高肥效。虽然今年密植增加了酿肥工作的一些困难，但是今年酿肥的面积和用肥量都大大增加，全部田酿了第一次肥，第二次酿肥的面积占30％，每亩酿肥量由过去二十担增加到二十八担，使得禾苗整个生长期保持浓绿粗壮，不会中期黄弱和早期倒伏。因为禾苗长得好，所以第二次评比的时候，红旗仍然稳插在凰村。第三次评比是以积集晚造肥为中心内容的，凰村大队在公社党委提出号召的当天，就掀起全民性的积肥高潮，比其他大队搞得快。评比时，各大队每亩积肥三十担左右，而凰村大队却以四十九担的成绩再次夺得红旗。流动红旗不流动，稳固地插在凰村田头，迎风招展。
                  特大丰收
    今年特大丰收啦！在夏收的日子里，金黄的谷子像山一样堆满田头，挤掉了社员睡觉的地方，人们干脆睡在谷堆上。这一造收割的结果：亩产量三百八十六斤，比去年增长46％；总产量五十九万四千零一十斤，比去年增长41％。苦战了半年的凰村，生产获得了特大跃进！
    今天的凰村，已经成为各大队的学习榜样。在夏种的日子里，凰村的干部和群众为了实现晚造亩产六百斤、全年亩产一千斤的目标，日夜在田间苦战着。晚造超早造的信念，亩产千斤的信念，已经牢固地掌握了群众，群众爆发出充分自觉的劳动热情。夏种里常常发生这样的事情：干部和群众是一起住在田头寮寨的，晚上干部收工回来，常常不见社员回来睡，原来他们是在开夜工。这样的事情，事前干部是一点也不知道的。又比如，队里定出耕作的规格是一犁两耙一辘轴，但是群众唯恐达不到六百斤的产量，自动再加了两耙一辘轴。这样超额加工的田，大约有70％。质量如此，季节呢？去年在别人支援三千个工的情况下，仍然拖到“立秋”以后十一天才插完秧，而今年不用别地支援，在“立秋”前五天就结束夏种了。
