After Watching the Workers' Cultural Troupe Performance
　　Ye Lin

In late August, a large-scale observation performance was held by the workers' cultural troupes of various industries and trade union systems in Beijing. A total of thirteen performing groups from five systems, including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, coal mines, railways, construction, and geology, participated in the performance, presenting twelve evenings of performances in various forms, including song and dance, opera, dance drama, drama, opera, folk art, and acrobatics. This was the first time that the workers' cultural troupes of various systems held such a large-scale joint performance. It not only allowed them to observe and learn from each other and review their strength, but also aroused new attention to the question of how to use literary and artistic weapons to serve the workers.

In our art ranks, this team dedicated to serving the working masses is an important force that cannot be ignored. In the past few years, after some rectification and improvement, it has become a powerful force, well-organized, and has achieved new developments in terms of quality, quantity, and variety. The variety of styles and the breadth of content of this observation performance evening show the multifaceted needs of the spiritual life of the working masses, and these teams are fully capable of meeting these needs, which is gratifying.

In the performance, we also saw a number of excellent programs, which to a large extent have certain unique qualities of workers' literature and art, forming some new styles of workers' cultural troupes. Among them, their dance programs were particularly prominent. Such as the small dance drama "Robbing the Bride," dances "Naughty Young Workers," "Lion Dance," "On the Train," etc., are full of a romantic spirit of creation, with a comedic style and a sense of humor. "Robbing the Bride" borrows the theme of landlords robbing brides in folk tales, but mistakenly robbing a bear, using the exaggerated techniques of the field秧歌 to satirize the ignorance of the feudal landlord class in a near-mocking way; "Naughty Young Workers" boldly absorbs some of the performances of clowns in acrobatics, depicting two naughty workers teasing each other during rest; the lion in "Lion Dance" may be said to be the most naughty and human-like lion of all lion dances; everyone in "On the Train" is endowed with an optimistic and humorous nature. All of these are concrete manifestations of the working class's revolutionary optimism. In this era of socialist construction with a cheerful mood and high morale, this sense of humor in art is undoubtedly very valuable, especially in dance programs, this element should be developed. Although these dances of the workers' cultural troupes may have some other minor shortcomings, they can be inspiring in this regard, and their spirit of bold innovation in art is even more worthy of encouragement and promotion.

It seems that this temperament is not only in dance, but also in many of their songs, acrobatics, and even the drama "Flying Together," which have this healthy optimistic nature.

In another type of program, we often come into contact with another aspect of the working class's unique temperament—an unparalleled deep affection for the revolution and the Party. This can be felt in the one-act opera "Pearl Wall" and many programs reflecting real life. "Pearl Wall" tells the moving story of the wife of a worker at the Anyuan Coal Mine protecting a slogan written by the Red Army in 1930 for sixteen years. It is undoubtedly very important for the workers' cultural troupes to explore and perform more works of this kind, which can vividly express the noble character of the working class and the flesh-and-blood relationship with the Party, to educate today's working masses.

Expressing the working class's soaring enthusiasm and anti-rightist and anti-conservative spirit is also one of the characteristics of this performance. The opera "The Triumph Song of Daqing Mountain," the dances "New Products," and "Harvesting Sweet Potatoes" are all more prominent works in this regard. "The Triumph Song of Daqing Mountain" tells the true story of breaking superstitions and building a cooling tower without scaffolding. The advantage of this opera is that through this typical event, it focuses on portraying the sharp struggle between two kinds of thinking, thus showing the heroic nature of the working class in despising difficulties.

From the many programs mentioned above, it is further realized that the key to the formation of the unique style of the workers' cultural troupes lies in being able to shape the great image and spiritual outlook of the working class in art. No matter what the subject matter, whether it is reflecting the production and life of workers, historical subjects or other aspects, it can reveal the unique analytical power, unique temperament and viewpoint of the working class. In this way, the richness of content and the diversity of artistic forms can go hand in hand with the establishment of the unique style of the workers' cultural troupes, and can complement each other; therefore, we also welcome the emergence of the large-scale mythological dance drama "Siamese Lotus" and the medium-sized dance drama "Dujiangyan." "Siamese Lotus" comes from Pu Songling's "Evening Glow" in *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*, but it is endowed with clear class content, and the theme has far exceeded the level of the original novel and has new significance.

We should pay attention to the many new things that have emerged in this performance, which are all gratifying signs of the development of the workers' art cause.

    看工人文工团观摩演出以后
    叶林
    8月下旬，在北京的各产业、工会系统的工人文工团举行了一次大规模的观摩演出。参加演出的单位共有全国总工会、煤矿、铁路、建筑、地质等五个系统的十三个演出团体，演出了歌舞、歌剧、舞剧、话剧、戏曲、曲艺、杂技等各种形式的晚会共达十二个。各系统的工人文工团举行这样大规模的联合演出还是第一次，从中不仅可以相互观摩，检阅力量，并且还使人对于如何运用文艺武器为工人服务的问题，引起了新的注意。
    在我们的艺术队伍中，这支专门为工人群众服务的队伍是一支不可忽视的重要力量。几年来，经过了一些整顿和提高，已经是阵容强大，队伍整齐，并且无论从质量、数量和品种上都有了新的发展。这次观摩演出晚会的式样之多，节目内容之广，说明了和反映出工人群众的精神生活的多方面的需要，而这些团队对满足这些需要是完全能够胜任的，这是值得我们高兴的。
    在演出中，我们还看到了一批优秀的节目，这些节目在很大程度上又带有工人文艺的某些特有的气质，形成了工人文工团的一些新的风格。这当中，特别是他们的舞蹈节目表现得最为突出。如小型舞剧
  “抢亲”，舞蹈“顽皮的青工”“狮舞”“在列车上”等，都充满了一种富于浪漫主义的创造精神，具有喜剧的风格和幽默感。“抢亲”借用了民间传说中地主抢亲却错抢了熊瞎子的题材，用地秧歌的夸大手法，对封建地主阶级的愚昧进行了迹近于戏谑的讽刺；“顽皮的青工”大胆地吸收了杂技中丑角的某些表演，刻划了两个顽皮工人在休息时的相互捉弄；“狮舞”中的狮子也许可以说是所有狮舞的狮子中最顽皮而富于人情味的一只；“在列车上”的每一个人物都赋予一种乐观而幽默的天性。所有这些，正是工人阶级革命乐观主义气质的具体表现。在这个心情舒畅、斗志昂扬的社会主义建设时代，这种艺术上的幽默感无疑是十分可贵的，特别是在舞蹈节目中，应该使这种因素得到发展。工人文工团的这些舞蹈尽管可能存在着另外的一些小缺点，但在这方面却能给人以启发，他们在艺术上的大胆创新的精神也更加值得鼓励与发扬。
    看来这种气质并不止是在舞蹈中才有，在他们的许多歌曲、杂技以至于话剧“比翼齐飞”等节目中，也都具有这种健康的乐观天性。
    在另一种类型的节目里，我们又经常接触到工人阶级特有气质的另一个方面——对革命、对党的无比深厚的感情。像独幕歌剧“珍珠墙”以及好些反映现实生活的节目中，都能够得到体会。“珍珠墙”写一个安源煤矿的工人妻子保护一幅在1930年红军写下的标语至十六年之久的动人故事。工人文工团多多发掘和演出这种题材的作品无疑是十分重要的，这能够形象地表现出工人阶级的高贵品德以及和党的血肉关系，来教育今天的工人群众。
    表现工人阶级的冲天干劲和反右倾反保守的精神，也是这次会演节目的特色之一。歌剧“大青山凯歌”、舞蹈“新产品”“抢收白薯”等都是这方面较为突出的作品。“大青山凯歌”写的是破除迷信，不用搭脚手架建成了冷却塔的真实故事。这个歌剧的优点是通过这一典型事件，着重刻划了两种思想的尖锐斗争，从而显示了工人阶级的藐视困难的英雄本色。
    从上面所涉及的这许多节目中，使人进一步体会到，工人文工团特有风格的形成，重要的关键是在于能够在艺术中塑造出工人阶级的伟大形象和精神风貌，不论是通过什么题材，反映工人生产与生活的题材也好，历史题材或其它方面的题材也好，都能够从中透露出工人阶级特有的分析力，特有的气质和观点。这样，内容的丰富多采和艺术形式的多样化，可以和建立工人文工团特有的风格并行不悖，并且可以相辅相成；由是，我们也欢迎大型神话舞剧“并蒂莲”和中型舞剧“都江堰”的产生。“并蒂莲”出自聊斋志异中的“晚霞”，但却赋予了明确的阶级内容，主题已经远远超过了原来小说的水平，而具有了新的意义。
    我们应该重视这次会演当中出现的许多新鲜事物，它们都是工人艺术事业发展的可喜的标志。
