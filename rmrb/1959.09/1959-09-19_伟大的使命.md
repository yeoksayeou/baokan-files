    Great Mission
    Lin Hongsun, Associate Researcher, Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    On the morning of September 14, 1959, the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket reached the moon, completing for the first time a flight from Earth to another celestial body, thus advancing the cause of interstellar travel a major step forward – this is an important milestone in the history of human scientific development.
    Below we would like to explore the scientific issues related to this great event from three aspects: 1. The laws of motion of artificial celestial bodies, 2. Exploration of the Moon, 3. Prospects for interstellar travel.
    The Laws of Motion of Artificial Celestial Bodies
    Engels once wrote: "As soon as we have created the conditions under which a particular motion occurs in nature, we can induce that particular motion; we can even produce motions which do not occur at all in nature (industry), or at least not in this way; we can predetermine the direction and scale of these motions." ("Dialectics of Nature," p. 191)
    The realization of artificial Earth satellites and cosmic rockets fully confirms the correctness of these predictions by Engels. The basic laws of celestial motion were discovered in the era of the creation of modern natural science: Newton started from Kepler's astronomical observations and analyzed the quantitative relationship of universal gravitation, thus finding the most important key to understanding the orbits and periods of celestial bodies. Telescopes have been used to discover many new worlds that are invisible to the naked eye, and these discoveries are sometimes even predicted by mechanical calculations. We should remember the sensation in the scientific community when Neptune was discovered by astronomers in 1846 based on the calculations of Adams and Le Verrier, and when Pluto was discovered in 1930 based on the calculations of Lowell.
    However, these glorious achievements of the past, from the current perspective, still belong to the previous stage of human understanding of the history of the universe. At present, due to the development of rocket technology, we have stepped out of the stage of understanding the interstellar universe through observations on Earth and moved towards the stage of actually entering the interstellar universe away from Earth, which means that mankind has begun to create conditions to realize interstellar travel: the first few artificial celestial bodies have been born, and even the Moon, more than 300,000 kilometers away, is no longer unattainable.
    After artificial celestial bodies (artificial satellites and cosmic rockets) enter orbit, the basic mechanical laws they follow are actually no different from those of natural celestial bodies. However, they raise a mechanical problem, which is to determine the motion of an object under a certain force after a certain initial condition is given. Here, the initial condition is the distance and velocity of the artificial celestial body relative to the parent body (e.g., Earth) upon entering orbit, and the force is the universal gravitation existing between the artificial celestial body and the natural celestial body.
    The task of rocket launching is to achieve the initial conditions of the predicted orbit as accurately as possible.
    When launching artificial celestial bodies using multi-stage rockets, the general procedure is as follows: the rocket initially rises vertically to quickly leave the denser atmosphere, which has greater resistance, and then gradually changes to a direction parallel to the ground. Through the thrust of several stages of rockets, the speed value continues to increase. The advantage of turning to a horizontal direction is that it can be perpendicular to the Earth's gravity and avoid losing speed due to the latter.
    When the engine of the last stage of the rocket stops working, the rocket itself, or the container separated from it carrying scientific instruments and communication equipment, will enter orbit. At this moment, its distance from the center of the Earth, its speed direction, and value constitute the aforementioned initial conditions, which have a significant impact on the orbit. Let's illustrate this with an example.
    Generally speaking, an artificial Earth satellite will not enter orbit exactly along a direction parallel to the ground. Therefore, the point where it enters orbit will not be the closest point to the Earth's center, and the altitude of the perigee will be smaller than the initial altitude. If the initial altitude upon entering orbit is about 200 kilometers, it is generally possible to obtain a perigee altitude of less than 150 kilometers. Although the air density at 150 kilometers is one millionth of the air density on the ground, the satellite still cannot avoid the fate of rapid incineration. The first Soviet artificial Earth satellite entered orbit at an altitude of 228 kilometers, and its speed at that time was 7,973 meters per second. According to calculations by Soviet scientists, if the inclination angle relative to the direction parallel to the ground was greater than 0.7 degrees, the altitude of the perigee would be equal to 148 kilometers, and then the artificial satellite could not even exist for more than a few hours.
    The initial velocity (i.e., the velocity obtained by the artificial celestial body upon entering orbit) also greatly affects the orbit. For example, the perigee of the second and third Soviet artificial Earth satellites were both around 224-225 kilometers above the ground in the early stages of their existence, but the altitude of the apogee greatly exceeded the apogee altitude of the first Soviet artificial Earth satellite (947 kilometers), reaching 1,671 kilometers and 1,880 kilometers respectively. According to calculations by Soviet scientists, the initial speed values of the second and third Soviet artificial Earth satellites were only 1.8% and 2.8% higher than the first Soviet artificial satellite, respectively. This shows that small differences in initial speed can greatly change the shape of the orbit.
    If the initial velocity is increased, the elliptical orbit will become larger and larger. When the initial velocity exceeds a certain value, a fundamental change in the nature of the orbit occurs – the orbit transitions to a hyperbolic shape. If the initial altitude is 300 kilometers above the ground, this critical value is 10,928 meters per second. Calculated on the Earth's surface, this critical value is what is commonly referred to as the second cosmic velocity, which is 11,180 meters per second.
    The initial velocity of a cosmic rocket has exceeded this critical value, so it moves along a section of a hyperbola within the Earth's gravitational range. When it is far away from the Earth, the Earth's gravity becomes very small, and the influence of other celestial bodies in the solar system becomes important. At this time, we say that the cosmic rocket has escaped the Earth's gravitational range. For example, the first Soviet cosmic rocket, after leaving the Earth for about 900,000 kilometers, was mainly affected by the Sun's gravity and formed an artificial planet of the Sun. Of course, it is also possible for a cosmic rocket to approach a celestial body (such as the Moon), and then be mainly affected by the gravity of this celestial body, forming its satellite or even colliding with it.
    The second Soviet cosmic rocket, because its last stage was controllable, achieved very accurate initial orbital conditions after launch, allowing it to successfully reach the surface of the Moon.
    We can also examine the accuracy of this from the flight test data of the first Soviet cosmic rocket.
    It can be deduced that when the first Soviet cosmic rocket entered orbit 200 kilometers above the ground, its speed was between 11,167 meters per second and 11,176 meters per second (the critical speed at that point to escape the Earth's gravitational range is 11,109 meters per second). If the actual speed at that time was indeed 11,109 meters per second, a decrease of slightly less than 1%, then the time to reach the lunar region would not be 34 hours after launch, but 45 hours. Such a large difference in time indicates a significant difference in the flight path.
    It can be calculated that if the first Soviet cosmic rocket approached the Moon two hours earlier than actually achieved, it could have collided with the Moon. To achieve this, it would only have been necessary to increase the initial speed by 40 meters per second, which is 0.36% of the original speed. If the actual achieved initial speed value was maintained, it would only have been necessary to change the initial speed direction by a quarter of a degree to make the first Soviet cosmic rocket encounter the Moon. Of course, the first Soviet cosmic rocket was not originally planned to hit the Moon. This mission was completed by its successor.
    The above discussion shows how high the accuracy of the required initial speed (direction and value) is for a cosmic rocket to hit the Moon. Mechanics helps us analyze this condition, and rocket technology (power and control) enables us to truly realize this condition. In this way, we have stepped into an era of artificial celestial body operation full of new miracles.
    Exploration of the Moon
    Rushing to the moon – this is the theme of many beautiful myths since ancient times. In fact, the Moon, as a natural satellite of the Earth, is naturally one of the celestial bodies that modern science first paid attention to and observed in detail.
    Because the period of the Moon's orbit around the Earth is the same as its own rotation period, only half of the Moon's surface can be observed from the Earth's surface. More precisely, due to some oscillations of the Moon itself, we can currently observe 59% of the lunar surface, and the other 41% is unknown territory.
    Thus, the first task in exploring the Moon scientifically is to produce a cosmic rocket that can bypass the Moon, take "pictures" of its far side, and then transmit this valuable data to the ground when the rocket approaches the Earth again.
    Another task can also be proposed: to establish an artificial lunar satellite that orbits the Moon and maintains constant contact with the Earth. If this plan can be realized, the exploration of the Moon can become permanent. At present, the work of the first and second Soviet cosmic rockets has already obtained a lot of scientific data on the Moon's magnetic field and radioactivity. After the establishment of the above-mentioned permanent observation station, the scope of exploration will be further expanded, and even radio waves can be used to preliminarily survey the treasures deep beneath the lunar surface, becoming the pioneers of human development of the Moon.
    Another goal of exploring the Moon is to safely send a certain amount of container (radio, television, and telemetry equipment) loaded with scientific instruments to the lunar surface and maintain constant communication with the Earth. The successful delivery of a marker with the Soviet emblem and characters to the lunar surface by the second Soviet cosmic rocket shows that the achievement of this goal is already in sight.
    What is the situation on the lunar surface? Currently, many research results have been obtained through observations from Earth. For example, we already know that the atmospheric density on the lunar surface is equivalent to the atmospheric density 80 kilometers above the Earth's surface. In this environment close to "vacuum," coupled with the lack of moisture, it is difficult for organisms to survive. The Moon was originally a peaceful world, but in the near future, it will become the location of many scientific research stations.
    The "terrain" of the lunar surface, from the results of observations, has already taken shape, and very detailed lunar surface maps have been drawn. We know that the lunar surface has many ring-shaped mountains and craters (close to circular, the diameter of the largest ring-shaped crater can reach 235 kilometers, and the diameter of the crater opening is generally less than 2 kilometers), many mountain systems as high as 7-8 kilometers, and lunar valleys (black fissures) as long as tens of thousands of kilometers. On the lunar surface, one can also observe many so-called "seas" (dark spots on the lunar surface), which are actually vast plains. In fact, the lunar surface is still in a process of evolution. For example, in November 1958, Soviet scientist Kozyrev also observed a lunar volcanic eruption.
    With the rapid development of science, cosmic rockets will carry people to this mysterious world for on-the-spot investigations. We estimate that initially, the method of orbiting the Moon and then returning to Earth will probably be adopted, and then attempts will be made to land on the Moon and take off back to Earth. The latter method is more difficult because the rocket not only needs to carry enough speed at the beginning to reach the lunar region, but also needs to have a certain amount of fuel reserves to generate deceleration to avoid the landing speed of more than 3 kilometers per second caused by the Moon's gravity. In addition, fuel reserves are needed to establish the conditions for breaking away from the Moon's gravity and flying back to Earth. This requirement can be met by a method: first launch the fuel to the lunar surface with other rockets, as a refueling station for the journey back to Earth.
    What conditions need to be established to achieve the various steps of exploring the Moon mentioned above? This requires another analysis of mechanics. Compared with the previous problem of breaking away from the Earth's gravitational range, this problem is more complex because it involves the so-called three-body problem in celestial mechanics (the three bodies currently discussed are cosmic rockets, Earth, and Moon).
    Soviet scientists Yegorov and his colleagues used high-speed electronic computers to perform calculations related to these aspects from 1953 to 1955. Their conclusions can be summarized as follows:
    (1) The accuracy required for landing on the Moon is technically feasible. In the thrust-free (i.e., the engine is not working) flight stage of the rocket after the launch phase is completed, there is no need to further correct the orbit (this correction is usually achieved by burning a small amount of fuel to generate jet streams in different directions).
    (2) It is also possible for a rocket to start from Earth, bypass the Moon at a considerable distance (for example, more than 60,000 kilometers away from it), and then return to the vicinity of the Earth. No orbital correction is required during the thrust-free stage.
    (3) In the above situation, if you want to reduce the speed of the rocket on its way back when it approaches the Earth so that it can land safely on the Earth's surface (this is obviously a basic requirement for manned lunar exploration rockets), you must try to make the rocket fly in obliquely when it re-enters the denser atmosphere near the ground. In this way, the adverse effects of heating due to air friction can be overcome. However, such a scheme requires too high accuracy of the initial conditions at launch, and it is bound to be corrected in the thrust-free stage (especially in the orbit after bypassing the Moon).
    (4) It is practically impossible to launch a cosmic rocket from Earth to continuously and periodically orbit the Moon and the Earth.
    The last conclusion should not make us pessimistic, because we can always find ways to continuously correct the orbit to achieve such a cosmic rocket that makes periodic movements around the Earth and the Moon. The problem is that this requires the engine to work for a long time. It is unrealistic to use chemical fuels, and we may have to wait for the realization of some new types of engines, such as ion rocket engines.
    The fact that the second Soviet cosmic rocket reached the Moon has made the possibility predicted by the first point of the conclusion a reality. Mankind's Earth-Moon-Earth journey will also become a reality one day. Isn't this more moving than mythology?
    Prospects for Interstellar Travel
    Only a few years ago, interstellar travel was only discussed in a small circle of scientists. At that time, some of the boldest predictions (for example, when a rocket could bombard the Moon) were surpassed by the high speed of science. Now the vast masses know that interstellar travel is not some absurd fantasy, but a living reality.
    On October 4, 1957, the successful launch of the first Soviet artificial Earth satellite announced the beginning of the era of interstellar travel. Artificial Earth satellites, even with the launch of cosmic rockets today, still have their great scientific significance, or rather, their scientific significance is even more important.
    The Soviet Union has launched artificial Earth satellites one after another, and the quality is significantly larger than the other. This trend will continue. The scope of scientific research will also be further expanded. The next step is to establish some long-lasting artificial Earth satellites carrying optical and television equipment that can put the entire Earth's surface within its field of vision. At this time, radio communication and weather forecasting will have unprecedented progress, and artificial Earth satellites will be further closely connected with people's daily lives.
    In order to promote human interstellar travel, it is also necessary to continuously implement the plan to recover artificial Earth satellites, that is, to make the artificial Earth satellite or a part of it safely reach the ground by relying on the aerodynamic action (such as the lift action of additional wing surfaces). Here, the problem of "heat barrier" must also be solved, that is, to find ways to avoid excessive heating and incineration of the surface of the artificial satellite when it re-enters the denser atmosphere. Later, instruments and equipment, experimental animals, and people will be used as passengers on artificial satellites in sequence. With the improvement of technology, the size and quality of artificial satellites will become larger and larger, and the height from the ground can also change from the hundreds of kilometers currently reached by general artificial satellites to thousands of kilometers. To a certain extent, it may be possible to establish a refueling station for interstellar travel.
    From the perspective of speed requirements, the current level of rocket technology is already sufficient to send cosmic rockets to the vicinity of Mars and Venus, some solar planets closer to the Earth. Of course, to realize scientific exploration rockets orbiting these planets, considerable efforts are still needed in science and technology.
    The first Soviet cosmic rocket has formed an artificial asteroid orbiting the sun. In the future, a series of artificial solar planets will appear to explore the vast space in the solar system.
    In order to realize these great missions, it is also necessary to solve all kinds of scientific and technological problems. Although this mainly involves problems in the four aspects of (1) power, (2) control, (3) communication, and (4) space medicine, the huge scale of interstellar travel itself stipulates that the scientific topics involved are all-encompassing. The promotion of scientific and technological development by the proposal of these topics is difficult to estimate.
    Engels put forward the truth of "Man will conquer nature" in this way: "The naturalistic view of history believes that only nature acts on people, and only natural conditions determine the historical development of people everywhere; this view of history is therefore one-sided, it forgets that people also react to nature, change nature, and create new living conditions for themselves." ("Dialectics of Nature" p. 192)
    The successful arrival of the second Soviet cosmic rocket to the Moon heralds the arrival of a new era. Humans will leave the embrace of the Earth like young people bidding farewell to their mothers and heading towards a new life, and conquer new territories through the boundless starry sky. Human youth is unlimited, and the future of communism is infinitely beautiful!

    伟大的使命
    中国科学院力学研究所副研究员　林鸿荪
    1959年9月14日的清晨，苏联的第二个宇宙火箭到达了月球，第一次完成了从地球到另一天体的飞行，从而使星际航行的事业又推进了一大步——这是人类科学发展历史上的一个重要的里程碑。
    下面我们想从三个方面来探讨与这伟大事件有关的科学问题：一、人造天体的运动规律，二、月球的探索，三、星际航行的展望。
    人造天体的运动规律
    恩格斯曾经写道：“只要我们造成某一特定的运动在自然界中发生时所必需的条件，我们就能引起这一特定的运动；甚至我们还能产生在自然界中完全不会发生的运动（工业），至少不是以这种方式产生的运动；我们能预先规定这些运动的方向和规模。”（“自然辩证法”，一九一页）
    人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭的实现，充分证实了恩格斯这些预言的正确性。天体运动的基本规律是在近代自然科学创立的时代就已经被发现了的：牛顿从凯普勒的天文观测结果出发，分析出万有引力的定量关系，从而找到了了解天体轨道和周期的一把最重要的钥匙。利用望远镜发现许多用肉眼看不到的新世界，而且这些发现有时甚至是先由力学的计算预测出来的。我们应该记得，在天文学家1846年根据亚当斯和勒维叶尔的计算发现海王星以及在1930年根据洛威尔的计算发现冥王星时在科学界所引起的轰动。
    然而过去这些光辉的成就，从现在的眼光看来，还毕竟是属于人类认识宇宙历史的前一阶段的。目前，由于火箭技术的发展，使我们踏出了凭地球上观测来认识星际宇宙的阶段，而走向了脱离地球实际进入星际宇宙的阶段，这就是说，人类已经开始能够创造条件来实现星际的航行：最初的几个人造天体已经诞生了，甚至于远在三十多万公里以外的月球也不再是可望而不可即的了。
    在人造天体（人造卫星和宇宙火箭）走上轨道以后，它们所遵循的基本力学规律实际上和自然天体并没有什么两样。但是它们提出一个力学问题，这就是在一定的初始条件给定后，在一定的作用力之下，确定物体运动的问题。这里，初始条件就是在进入人造天体相对于母体（譬如说地球）的距离和速度，而作用力也就是存在于人造天体和自然天体之间的万有引力。
    火箭发射的任务就是要尽可能准确地实现预言轨道的初始条件。
    在利用多级火箭发射人造天体时一般采用这样的程序：开始时火箭垂直上升以便迅速离开较密因而阻力较大的大气层，然后逐渐改成与地面平行的方向，通过几级火箭的推力作用，速度数值一直不断地增大。变成水平方向的好处是，这样可以和地心引力垂直，而且不至于由于后者而损失速度。
    在火箭最后一级的发动机停止工作时，它本身或者由它分出来的、装载科学仪器和通讯设备的容器就会进入轨道，在这一时刻它离地心的距离，它的速度方向和数值就组成了前述的初始条件，这些初始条件对于轨道有重大影响。试举例来说明这一点。
    一般地说，人造地球卫星在进入轨道时不会是恰好沿着平行于地面的方向，这样进入轨道的那一点也就不会是最靠近地心的一点，近地点的离地面高度就会比初始高度还要小些。如果进入轨道时的初始高度是二百公里左右，一般就有可能得到小于一百五十公里的近地点高度。虽然在一百五十公里处的空气密度已经比地面空气密度小一百万倍，卫星仍然不能避免迅速焚毁的命运。第一个苏联人造地球卫星进入轨道时的高度是二百二十八公里，该时速度是每秒七千九百七十三米。根据苏联科学家的计算，如果该时相对于平行地面方向倾斜角大于零点七度，近地点的高度就会等于一百四十八公里，那么人造卫星甚至不能存在几小时以上。
    初始速度（即进入轨道时人造天体已获得的速度）也很影响轨道。例如，第二个和第三个苏联人造地球卫星在存在的初期近地点离地面都在二百二十四——二百二十五公里左右，而远地点的高度却大大超过第一个苏联人造地球卫星的远地点高度（九百四十七公里）而分别为一千六百七十一公里和一千八百八十公里。根据苏联科学家的计算，第二个和第三个苏联人造地球卫星进入轨道的初始速度数值只不过比第一个苏联人造卫星分别高1.8％和2.8％。由此可见，初始速度的微小差别可以使轨道样子有很大改变。
    如果增大初始速度，椭圆轨道也就愈来愈大，直到初始速度超过一定数值时，就发生了轨道性质的根本改变——轨道过渡到双曲线型。如果初始离地面高度是三百公里，这临界数值是每秒一万零九百二十八米。按在地球表面上计算，这临界数值就是普通所称第二宇宙速度，它是每秒一万一千一百八十米。
    宇宙火箭的初始速度已经超过这个临界值，因此它在地球的引力范围之内是沿着一支双曲线的线段运动的。在离开地球比较远的时候，地球的引力就变得很小，而太阳系中其它天体的影响反而显得重要，这时我们就说宇宙火箭已经脱离地球的引力范围。例如第一个苏联宇宙火箭在离开地球约九十万公里之后就主要只受太阳的引力作用而形成了太阳的人造行星。当然也有可能宇宙火箭接近于一个天体（譬如说月球），而此后主要受这一天体的引力作用而运动着，形成它的卫星或甚至于撞击到它上面。
    第二个苏联宇宙火箭由于它最后一级是可以控制的，因此发射后达到的轨道初始条件十分准确，得以成功地到达月球表面。
    我们还可以从第一个苏联宇宙火箭的飞行实测数据来考察这个准确度的问题。
    可以推算出来，在第一个苏联宇宙火箭进入轨道离地面二百公里时，其速度是在每秒一万一千一百六十七米和每秒一万一千一百七十六米之间（在该处足以逃出地球
  引力范围的临界速度是每秒一万一千零九米），假如说该时实际速度果真是每秒一万一千零九米，即略减1％的样子，那末到达月球区域的时间就不会是发射后的三十四小时而会是四十五小时，时间差别如此之大，说明飞行路径有相当的不同。
    可以计算出来，假使第一个苏联宇宙火箭比实际实现的赶前两小时接近月球，它就可以和月球碰上了，为此只需要把初始速度提高每秒四十米，也就是原来的0.36％。如果仍然保持实际实现的初始速度数值，只要把初始速度方向改变四分之一度，也就有可能使第一个苏联宇宙火箭和月球相遇。当然，第一个苏联宇宙火箭本来并不是计划打到月球上去的，这一使命是由它的后继者来完成了的。
    上面的讨论表明，为了要使宇宙火箭碰到月球上去，所需初始速度（方向和数值）的准确度是多末高。力学帮助我们分析这个条件，而火箭技术（动力和控制）使我们真正能够实现这个条件。这样，我们就跨进了充满新的奇迹的人造天体运行的时代。
    月球的探索
    奔向月球——这是从古以来许多美妙的神话的主题。实际上，月球作为地球的天然卫星，理所当然地是近代科学最先注意而且最详细地观测的天体之一。
    由于月球环绕地球运行的周期和它本身自转的周期相同，所以从地球表面上只能观测到月球的一半面。更准确地说，由于月球本身有一些摆动，所以我们目前可以观测到月面的59％，另外的41％是未知的疆界。
    这样，在探索月球的科学任务上首先就摆着一个课题，这就是产生一种宇宙火箭，它能够绕过月球，对它的背面拍摄“像片”，然后当火箭重新靠近地球的时候把这些珍贵的资料传到地面。
    还可以提出另一个任务：建立一个人造月球卫星，环绕月球运动，并保持与地球的经常联系。如果这一计划能够实现，对于月球的探索就可以成为经常性的了。目前，通过第一个和第二个苏联宇宙火箭的工作已经获得了不少有关月球磁场和放射性的科学资料；在建立上述经常性的观测站后，探索的范围就进一步扩大，甚至于能够用无线电波来初步勘查月球表面下深处的宝藏，成为人类开发月球的先驱。
    探索月球的另一个目标就是将一定份量的装载科学仪器的容器（无线电、电视及遥测设备）安然地送上月球表面，并保持与地球的经常通讯联系。第二个苏联宇宙火箭成功地把带有苏联国徽和字样的标记安然送到到月球表面，说明这一目标的达到已经有苗头。
    月球表面的情况如何？目前通过地球上的观测已经有了许多研究成果。例如我们已经知道月球表面的大气密度相当离地球表面八十公里高空的大气密度。在这种接近于“真空”的环境，加上没有水份，生物是难于生存的。月球上本来是一个宁静的世界，而不远的将来，却要成为许多科学研究站的所在地了。
    月球表面的“地势”从观测的结果来看，已经有了眉目，很精细的月面图已经绘制出来。我们知道，月球表面有许多寰形山和火孔（接近于圆环形，最大寰形山口直径可达二百三十五公里，火孔口直径一般在二公里以下），有许多高达七——八公里的山脉系统，还有长达数万公里的月谷（黑色的裂缝）。在月球表面上还可观察到许多实际上是广阔的平原的所谓“海”（月面的黑斑）。实际上月球表面还处在一种演化的过程中，例如1958年11月苏联科学家科齐列夫还观察到月面火山的爆发。
    随着科学的迅速发展，宇宙火箭将装载着人到这个神秘的世界去作实地考察。我们估计，开始时大概会采用环绕月球再回到地球的方式，然后才会尝试在月球上降落和起飞回到地球。后一种方式是要比较困难些，因为火箭不仅要在一开始携有足够的速度来到达月球区域，而且还要有一定的燃料储备来产生减速，以避免由于月球引力而产生的每秒三公里以上的降落速度。另外还要有燃料储备来建立摆脱月球引力飞回地球的条件。这种要求可以采用一种办法来应付：先把燃料用另外一些火箭发射到月球表面上，作为回到地球之行的加油站。
    上面提到的探索月球的各个步骤实现所需建立的条件如何，这又需要力学的分析。比起前面脱离地球引力范围的那个问题来说，这个问题要比较复杂些，因为它牵涉到天体力学中的所谓三体问题（目前讨论的三体是宇宙火箭、地球和月球）
    苏联科学家叶果洛夫和他的同事在1953—1955年间利用高速电子计算机进行了这些方面有关的计算，其结论可以归结为下列几点：
    （1）向月球降落所要求的准确度在技术上是可以实现的，在发射阶段完成后火箭的无推力（即发动机不在工作）的飞行阶段中，不需要另外再对轨道加以纠正（这种纠正通常是用少量燃料燃烧产生不同方向的喷气射流来实现的）。
    （2）火箭从地球出发，距离月球相当远（譬如说离开它六万公里以上）绕过月球再回到地球附近也是有可能的，在无推力阶段也不需要轨道的纠正。
    （3）在上述情况要想使火箭回来的路程中在接近地球时能够把速度减低，以至能安然落在地球表面上（这显然是载人的环绕月球探索火箭的一个起码要求），就要设法使火箭重入地面附近较密的大气层时是斜着飞进来的。这样，由于空气摩擦而加热的不良影响才有可能克服。可是这样的方案对于发射时的初始条件准确度要求太高，势必要在无推力阶段（特别是在绕月球后的轨道）加以纠正。
    （4）想从地球发射宇宙火箭把月球和地球都围绕在内作不断的周期性的飞行在实际上是不可能的。
    最后这一点结论当然不应该使我们悲观，因为总还可以设法不断纠正轨道来实现这种环绕地球和月球作周期性运动的宇宙火箭。问题是这里需要发动机长时间工作，利用化学燃料是不现实的，恐怕得等待一些新型的发动机——例如离子火箭发动机的实现了。
    苏联第二个宇宙火箭到达月球的事实，已使第一点结论所推测的可能性变成现实。人类的地球——月球——地球之行也将有朝一日成为现实。这岂不是比神话更动人么？
    星际航行的展望
    在几年以前还只是在很少数的科学家的圈子里谈到星际航行，那时所作的一些最大胆的预测（譬如说哪年能够用火箭轰击月球）都被科学的高速度所超过了。现在广大的群众都知道，星际航行不是什么荒诞不经的妄想，而是活生生的现实了。
    1957年10月4日那一天苏联的第一个人造地球卫星成功发射，宣告了星际航行时代的开始。人造地球卫星，即使在宇宙火箭发射的今天，仍然有它的巨大科学意义，或者应该说，它的科学意义更加重要了。
    苏联接二连三地发射人造地球卫星，质量显著地一个比一个大，这种趋势还将继续下去。科学研究的范围也就会更加扩大。下一步就是要建立一些存在时间较长的、载有光学和电视设备的人造地球卫星，能够把整个地球表面都放在它的视野之内。这时候无线电通讯和气象预报就会有了以前所根本不能比拟的进展，人造地球卫星和人类的日常生活会进一步密切起来。
    为了促进人类的星际航行，还必须不断地实现人造地球卫星的回收的计划，这就是使人造地球卫星或它的某一部分依靠空气动力的作用（例如附加翼面的举力作用）来安然到达地面。这里还必须解决“热障”的问题，即设法避免人造卫星的表面在重新穿入较密大气层时的过份加热以致焚毁。以后，顺序地把仪器设备，试验动物和人来当作人造卫星的乘客。随着技术的改进，人造卫星的尺寸和质量会一个比一个大，离地面的高度也可以从现在的一般人造卫星所达数百公里变为数千公里。到一定程度就可能建立一个为星际航行服务的加油站。
    从速度要求的角度上来看，目前火箭技术的水平已经足以把宇宙火箭送到火星和金星这一些离地球比较近的太阳行星附近去。当然，要实现绕行这些行星的科学探测火箭，还需要在科学技术上作出相当的努力。
    第一个苏联宇宙火箭已经形成一个环绕太阳转的人造小行星，以后还会出现一系列的人造太阳行星来探测太阳系里辽阔的空间。
    为了实现这一些伟大的使命，还必须解决科学技术上各种各样的问题。虽然主要这里牵涉到（1）动力，（2）控制，（3）通讯，（4）宇宙医学四个方面的问题，但星际航行的巨大规模本身就规定了它所牵涉到的科学课题是包罗万象的。这些课题的提出，对于科学技术发展的促进作用是难以估计的。
    恩格斯这样地提出“人定胜天”的真理：“自然主义的历史观认为只是自然界作用于人，只是自然条件到处在决定人的历史发展；这种历史观因此是片面的，它忘记了人也反作用于自然界，改变自然界，为自己创造新的生存条件。”（“自然辩证法”192页）
    苏联发射的第二个宇宙火箭成功地到达月球，昭示着一个新的时代的到来。人类将像青年人告别自己的母亲走向新的生活那样，脱离地球的怀抱，通过一望无际的星空，去征服新的疆域。人类的青春是不可限量的，共产主义的前途是无限美妙的！
