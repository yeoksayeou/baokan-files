Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 9th. Guevara, the head of the Cuban economic delegation, stated to the press yesterday after returning home that the conspiracy to turn Cuba into a second Guatemala has not stopped, and the Cuban people must unite closely to deal with all domestic and foreign attacks.

Guevara condemned the anti-Cuba propaganda of the U.S. ruling group's press. He pointed out: The American "Time" magazine deliberately spread lies, "portraying Cuba and Iraq as their so-called two 'centers of communist conspiracy'." This is a very obvious conspiracy. When talking about the delegation's visit to Japan, Guevara said that the delegation members in Hiroshima realized that atomic weapons meant enormous danger to the whole world, and he believed that it was necessary to "struggle, to more forcefully oppose all attempts to use atomic weapons, and oppose all acts of resisting the reduction of atomic armaments."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana. The Cuban National Land Reform Committee has printed 200,000 land certificates. After land distribution, 18,500 land certificates will be issued monthly to the beneficiaries of land reform.

This was stated by Núñez Jiménez, Director of the Cuban National Land Reform Committee, when he met with reporters on the 3rd.

The Cuban Land Reform Law stipulates that the land area owned by an individual or group shall not exceed thirty caballerías. Since the statutory three-month period expired on the 3rd, landlords must report to the National Land Reform Committee the amount of land exceeding the limits stipulated in the Land Reform Law. Those who fail to comply with the regulations or forge materials will have their land confiscated without compensation.

The Cuban National Land Reform Committee announced that planned economy will be implemented in all provinces of Cuba. This work has already begun in Camagüey province. In Camagüey province, the National Land Reform Committee has taken over 30,000 caballerías of land and allocated 5 million pesos to systematically develop the economic construction of this vast area.

    格瓦拉返国后对报界发表声明
    斥美统治集团报刊反古巴宣传
    古巴贯彻执行土地改革法即将颁发土地证
    据新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴经济代表团团长格瓦拉昨天回国后在对报界发表的声明里说，要使古巴成为第二个危地马拉的阴谋活动还没有停止，古巴人民要紧密团结来对付国内外的一切进攻。
    格瓦拉谴责美国统治集团报刊的反古巴宣传。他指出：美国“时代”杂志故意散布谎言，“把古巴和伊拉克说成是他们所谓的两个‘共产主义阴谋中心’”。这是一个非常明显的阴谋。格瓦拉在谈到代表团在日本的访问时说，代表团人员在广岛体会到原子武器对全世界意味着巨大的危险，他认为必须“进行斗争，更有力地反对一切使用原子武器的企图，反对一切抗拒裁减原子军备的行为”。
    新华社哈瓦那电　古巴土地改革全国委员会已经印出了二十万份土地证，在土地分配以后，每月将颁发一万八千五百份土地证给土地改革的受益人。
    这是古巴土地改革全国委员会主任努?斯·希门尼斯3日在接见记者时说的。
    古巴土地改革法规定，个人或团体拥有的土地面积不得超过三十卡瓦耶里亚。由于法定的三个月期限3日已经到期，因此地主都必须向土地改革全国委员会呈报超过土地改革法规定限度的土地数量，凡不照章办理或是伪造材料者，其土地均予无偿没收。
    古巴土地改革全国委员会宣布古巴各省将开始实行计划经济。这项工作目前已经在卡马圭省开始。在卡马圭省，土地改革全国委员会接管了三万卡瓦耶里亚土地，并且拨出了五百万比索来有计划地发展这个广大地区的经济建设。
