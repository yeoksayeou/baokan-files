Xinhua News Agency: Lanzhou's key projects such as the oil refinery, chemical plant, and thermal power plant are speeding up construction, striving to have some or all of them completed and put into production before the end of September to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The second phase of the Lanzhou Refinery has many projects and extremely complex technology and equipment, making it impossible to complete comprehensively in the short term. In order to quickly realize the benefits of state investment and prepare to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day with outstanding achievements, the factory decided to concentrate resources and manpower to first tackle the construction of four sets of equipment: acid-base washing and urea dewaxing. After all of these devices are completed before the end of September, they can begin producing turbine oil, transformer oil, cable oil, and capacitor oil, which the country urgently needs, in the fourth quarter. The desulfurization and air compression workshops under construction at the chemical plant are key to further increasing fertilizer production. In response to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the chemical plant's production workers decided to increase fertilizer production by 36,000 tons more than the original design capacity before the end of the year. Therefore, construction and installation workers decided to complete the installation of the three workshops ahead of schedule by the end of September.

In order to speed up the construction progress of these key projects, the basic construction leading departments of Gansu Province and Lanzhou City have taken the following effective measures: First, basic construction projects that can be partially or fully completed before the end of September are listed as "first-line priorities," and manpower and materials are concentrated to ensure them first; second, if the materials required for key projects are not of the correct specifications, the provincial and municipal basic construction leading departments will assist in adjusting them among various units; third, the machinery manufacturing and distribution industry and the materials supply department will fully assist key projects in completing equipment matching; fourth, a joint command of construction between Party A and Party B is implemented to unify planning and deployment of manpower and materials.

    兰州重点工程加快建设速度
    新华社讯  兰州市正在加速建设炼油厂、化工厂、热电站等重点工程，力争在9月底以前部分或全部建成投入生产，迎接建国十周年。
    兰州炼油厂第二期工程的项目很多，技术设备也极复杂，不可能在短期内全面建成。这个厂为了迅速发挥国家投资效用，并且准备以卓越的成就迎接国庆十周年，决定集中物力人力，先行突击建设酸碱洗涤、尿素脱腊等四套装置。这些装置在9月底前全部建成以后，第四季度开始就可以为国家生产急需的透平油、变压器油、电缆油和电容器油等。化工厂正在施工的脱硫、空气压缩车间，是进一步增产化肥的关键。化工厂的生产工人为了响应党的八届八中全会号召，决定在年底前比原设计能力增产三万六千吨化肥。因此，建筑安装工人决定在9月底提前完成三个车间的安装工程。
    为了加快这些重点工程的建设进度，甘肃省和兰州市的基本建设领导部门，已采取了以下有力措施：一，把9月底前可以部分或全部建成的基本建设工程，列为“第一线重点”，集中人力、物力优先加以保证；二，重点工程需用的器材，如规格不合，由省、市基本建设领导部门协助在各单位间进行调剂；三，由机器制配业和物资供应部门，全力协助重点工程做好设备配套工作；四，实行甲乙方的施工联合指挥，统一安排计划，统一调度人力、物力。
