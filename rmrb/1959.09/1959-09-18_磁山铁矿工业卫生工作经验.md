Experience in Industrial Hygiene Work at the Cishan Iron Mine
Working Group of the Second Office of the State Council

The Cishan Iron Mine is located in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province. It has a history of twenty years and is one of the main sources of high-quality iron ore in China. The annual production target is 12 million tons, and there are currently more than 1,900 employees. The mine's hygiene work has been done excellently and has achieved great results. It is a model for hygiene work, maintaining consistent hygiene practices for six years. Since 1954, the incidence of disease and absenteeism due to illness among employees have decreased year by year, and the attendance rate has increased year by year.

Year　Incidence of Disease (%)　Absenteeism Rate (%)　Attendance Rate (%)
1953　8.44　6.64　88.30
1954　4.26　3.60 　93.82
1955　3.89 　2.80　96.20
1956　1.90　2.14　96.40
1957　0.98　1.66　97.02
1958　0.82　0.78　96.50
1959　1.88　1.09　97.00
(January-June)

The mine's hospital has fifty beds. Due to the low incidence of disease and few accidents, it is often vacant, and there are very few outpatients. Five diseases, namely relapsing fever, typhoid fever, encephalitis, kala-azar, and malaria, have been completely eliminated; dysentery and severe heatstroke have been basically controlled and have not occurred in the past two years. Due to the significant reduction in diseases, medical expenses have surpluses every year. For example, in 1957, the medical expense budget was more than 115,000 yuan, but only more than 81,000 yuan was actually used, including more than 13,000 yuan spent on prevention. At the end of the year, there was still a surplus of 34,000 yuan, accounting for 29.5% of the budgeted amount.

Eliminating the "Four Pests" (rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies) and paying attention to hygiene have become good habits. Abiding by hygiene covenants and implementing hygiene systems have become conscious actions of all employees and their families. Rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies have been basically eliminated, and five transformations have been initially achieved: whitewashing, greening, road paving, mural painting, and gardening. Environmental hygiene has been made clean and tidy. The hygiene of canteens, dormitories, and nurseries is also very good. The cooks understand nutrition knowledge, and there are more than forty kinds of dishes, so that the same meal is not repeated for twenty days.

Safety and hygiene work is also very outstanding, and there are very few casualties. In the first half of this year, there was only one seriously injured person and twenty-five slightly injured people. Many safe production teams have emerged throughout the mine. Among them, there are thirty teams that have been operating for one to six months, ten teams for six months to one year, and three teams for two and five years or more. The Ma Changfa production team has maintained six years without accidents.

The main reasons why the mine's safety and hygiene work has achieved the above results are as follows:

One, the mine leaders are good at summarizing experience and learning from lessons: Before 1953, the mine's sanitary conditions were very poor, with weeds and brick piles everywhere. The incidence of disease among employees was very high, and the attendance rate was very low. Every summer, intestinal infectious diseases were prevalent. Before 1953, the highest employee attendance rate was only 88.8%, and the incidence of disease was 8.44%. In the summer and autumn of 1953, 80% of employees suffered from dysentery and gastroenteritis, resulting in 25,564 lost workdays, which is equivalent to seventy workers not working for a year, which had a great impact on production and employee health. The mine leaders deeply felt from this historical lesson that protecting employee health and doing a good job in safety and hygiene are important conditions for ensuring production. The Party committee included hygiene work on the agenda and incorporated it into the production plan as an important evaluation criterion. The Party committee arranged for hygiene when arranging production and inspected hygiene when inspecting production, so that hygiene work and production were closely integrated. Due to the importance and close attention of the leadership, the hygiene situation has improved year by year since 1954, and production efficiency has also increased year by year, and production tasks have been overfulfilled every year. In 1954, the incidence of disease decreased by 50% compared with 1953, the absenteeism rate due to illness decreased by 46%, and the attendance rate increased by 6.2%. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, although the production tasks were very tight, the mine leaders not only did not relax on safety and hygiene, but instead grasped it more tightly. In 1958, the incidence of disease decreased by 90% compared with 1953, the absenteeism rate due to illness decreased by 88%, and the attendance rate reached 96.5%, an increase of 9.4%.

Two, the iron mine's leading cadres have a fairly good tradition of mass work and military work: The Party committee secretary and mine manager of the mine are both cadres who have been engaged in Party work for a long time, and the deputy mine manager is a veteran cadre transferred from the army, with rich experience in mass work and military work. They regard production as a battlefront, workers as soldiers, and themselves as members of the masses. The Party committee secretary and mine manager, like commanders in the army, play an exemplary role everywhere, lead by example in everything, take the lead in abiding by labor discipline, and conscientiously implement the hygiene system. Leading cadres wear leggings and safety helmets when going to the mountain. The Party committee secretary and mine manager both participate in the hygiene shock team and are responsible for the hygiene of a toilet each, which is cleaned and tidy, which has been praised by all employees and has a great impact. They treat the safety, hygiene, and welfare of workers like military leaders care for the health and life of soldiers. The deputy mine manager goes to the mountain every day to inspect production, safety, hygiene, and other work one to two times. Their working style of caring for workers in every possible way has played a huge role in promoting production and doing a good job in safety and hygiene.

Three, the iron mine's leading cadres are united and cooperate in division of labor: Because the Party committee secretary and mine manager are united, the cadres above and below are also united. After the Party committee makes a decision on any measures, the leading cadres will work together, resolutely and decisively, to implement it. There is a deputy mine manager in charge of safety and hygiene work in the mine, but all leading cadres can regard safety and hygiene work as an important condition for production, include it in the plan, and conscientiously implement it. Therefore, hygiene work in the mine has been regularized and institutionalized. For example, in the event of an epidemic, more decisive measures can be taken to mobilize the masses and carry out surprise attacks. For example, on January 6, 1959, the mine began to experience an epidemic of infectious diseases such as measles, pertussis, and influenza. The Party committee immediately took measures, deeply mobilized the masses, universally disinfected indoor and collective places, and cleaned and watered the living areas every day. The hospital organized a shock team to divide and contract areas and deliver medicines to homes. 3,524 people took preventive medicine. The workers organized an anti-epidemic propaganda shock team, held small-scale seminars or visited door-to-door, and launched a massive propaganda campaign throughout the mine area. Therefore, it was ensured that children did not go to the club to watch movies or wander around on the streets during the epidemic. It only took fourteen days to control the epidemic and isolate and treat all patients.

Four, the principle of "prevention first" is clearly implemented: Based on the incidence of diseases in recent years and seasonal characteristics, the mine has found the general pattern of disease occurrence. Therefore, the prevention work is grasped in a timely manner. In addition to striving to do a good job in routine hygiene work, in the spring, when preventing measles, pertussis, and scarlet fever, Zicao sugar, Zicao soup, and Leijisan drugs are generally given to susceptible children; in summer and autumn, when preventing dysentery, typhoid fever, and other intestinal infectious diseases, dysentery bacteriophage is taken and typhoid vaccine is injected, and Yínqiào soup is taken to prevent influenza. Preparations for heatstroke prevention and cooling are started every year in the spring. Their heatstroke prevention and cooling supplies can be guaranteed every year. When the mine manager goes to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places to attend meetings, he does not forget to purchase medicines needed for the mining area. A large proportion of the annual medical expenses are spent on preventing diseases. In 1957, the prevention funds accounted for 11.8% of the annual medical expenses; the scope of use of these prevention funds is very wide, including salt soda, summer tea, ice cream, and cooling belts for heatstroke prevention, 666 and DDT for disinfection, and various medicines for preventing infectious diseases, as well as for purchasing fly swatters, brooms, and even ice cream given to children for encouraging them to swat flies are included in the medical expenses. They believe that implementing the principle of "prevention first" and spending more money on prevention work is a great saving. Therefore, their preventive measures are both firm and thorough.

Five, the working method of the mass line is adopted to boldly mobilize the masses: The mine leaders can boldly mobilize the masses and rely on the masses in all their work, and discuss and solve problems together with the masses. In the first half of this year, 2,025 rationalization proposals were put forward through mobilizing the masses, creating wealth of 3.17 million yuan for the country. Based on the suggestions of the masses, the mine leaders focused on grasping seven major keys. In addition to the six major keys being production problems, one major key is safety and hygiene. They clearly proposed to ensure safety, completely renovate the insurance gates, make all preparations for heatstroke prevention and cooling, vigorously carry out the movement to eliminate pests and diseases, and promptly eliminate epidemics.

Nine staff members were generally established in each production team: hygiene staff, safety staff, attendance staff, tool custodian, quality inspector, rationalization proposal staff, cost accountant, propaganda and mobilization staff, and security staff. The hygiene staff is responsible for first aid treatment and prevention of diseases and injuries. The safety staff is responsible for the inspection, propaganda, and evaluation of safety equipment. These mass organizations have played a great role in ensuring safe production. Every summer, they also delegate the right for workers to take temporary rests to the production teams, and the teams can decide whether workers can take temporary rests based on production and the health conditions of the workers. This measure has been widely supported by the workers and has had good results. Because the mine leaders have adopted the working method of the mass line, every time hygiene work is carried out, it can be carried out smoothly. As long as the leaders put forward measures, the workers can immediately take action. In previous hygiene campaigns, a large number of hygiene activists and model figures emerged (there were 112 hygiene activists and three model units in 1958 alone), and they have played a great role in promoting hygiene work.

Six, publicity and education work is thorough: New workers generally receive three days of training before entering the mine and visit the site. After participating in production, they strictly fix the type of work and the work site. The production and safety education of new workers is contracted and responsible by veteran workers; the method of veteran workers leading new workers is adopted, and veteran workers care for new workers like veteran soldiers care for new soldiers. The mine leaders are also good at seizing typical examples of accidents to educate all workers. In the first half of this year, combined with the safety production inspection, 24 large-scale safety activities were carried out. The safety technical operating procedures were comprehensively implemented and revised, and the safety responsibility system was established and improved. Most employees received education and improved their understanding and technical level. Therefore, work-related accidents in May decreased by 68.5% compared with April.

The popularization of hygiene knowledge and the publicity and education on eliminating pests and diseases among employees and their families is also very thorough. The mine's "Four Pests" Elimination Headquarters and the Party Committee Propaganda Department are jointly responsible for this work, and widely use all propaganda tools, such as libraries, clubs, blackboard newspapers, propaganda vehicles, cartoons, big-character posters, radio, pictures, exhibitions, etc., as well as use various meeting opportunities to carry out hygiene propaganda. Hospital doctors are also responsible for organizing hygiene knowledge lectures or chats for employees and their families, including: eliminating the "Four Pests," environmental hygiene, industrial hygiene, maternal and child hygiene, and prevention of common diseases. Cooks, nursery workers, and midwives are generally given hygiene training. In addition, the hospital also formed a propaganda team to go deep into workers' dormitories and family villages to carry out propaganda, which was deeply welcomed by the masses. Through a series of publicity and education activities, the hygiene knowledge level of employees and their families has generally been improved, and they generally understand the importance of doing a good job in hygiene for protecting health and ensuring production. Hygiene work has become a good habit among workers, especially veteran workers.

Seven, the work of treating the symptoms and treating the root causes is well combined: Safe production and overfulfilling the state's tasks are their goals. In order to achieve this goal, the mine leaders have firmly grasped the seven major projects to fundamentally solve the problem of safe production. In terms of eliminating pests and diseases, they have also done a lot of work to treat the root causes, such as expanding prevention, popularizing hygiene knowledge, and improving working conditions. At the same time, through a series of hygiene campaigns, rich experience has been accumulated, and sound hygiene systems and management methods have been established in all aspects of production and life, such as the hygiene area responsibility system, the street and dormitory cleaning rotation system, the regular disinfection system for canteen utensils, and 11 kinds of management methods for nurseries, barbershops, bathhouses, and toilets.

The achievements of the Cishan Iron Mine's hygiene work are huge, and the experience is rich, which is worthy of learning from all regions. However, the mine is not complacent. They will continue to move forward on the basis of victory. This year's safety and hygiene work plan is formulated under the guidance of implementing the policy of safe production and prevention first. It requires: (1) Take comprehensive measures to eliminate occupational diseases; (2) On the basis of the five diseases that have been eliminated, further strive to eliminate venereal diseases and dysentery, and vigorously control measles and influenza; (3) Thoroughly realize the "Five Transformations." The masses' slogan is: Don't mention rats and sparrows, eliminate mosquitoes and flies, realize the "Five Transformations," and maintain the glorious red flag.

    磁山铁矿工业卫生工作经验
    国务院二办工作组
    磁山铁矿位于河北省邯郸专区境内，已有二十年历史，是我国优质铁矿主要产地之一，年产任务为一千二百万吨，现有职工一千九百余人。该矿卫生工作做的很出色，取得了巨大成绩，是卫生工作的一面红旗，做到了卫生工作经常化，六年如一日。从1954年以来职工发病率和因病缺勤率逐年下降，出勤率逐年提高。
    年度　发病率％  因病缺勤率％  出勤率％
    1953年　8.44　6.64　88.30
    1954年　4.26　3.60 　93.82
    1955年　3.89 　2.80　96.20
    1956年　1.90　2.14　96.40
    1957年　0.98　1.66　97.02
    1958年　0.82　0.78　96.50
    1959年　1.88　1.09　97.00
    （1—6月）
    该矿医院有五十张病床，由于发病率低，事故少，经常空闲，门诊病人很少。回归热、伤寒、大脑炎、黑热病、疟疾等五种疾病已彻底消灭；痢疾和重型中暑已基本控制，两年来没有发生。由于疾病大大减少，医药经费年年结余。如1957年医药费预算十一万五千多元，实际只用了八万一千多元，其中还包括用于预防的开支一万三千多元，到年底仍结余三万四千元，占预算数的29.5％。
    除四害讲卫生已成为良好习惯，遵守卫生公约，执行卫生制度已成为全体职工及家属的自觉行动。鼠、雀、蚊、蝇已基本消灭，初步实现了五化：白化、绿化、马路化、壁画化、花园化。环境卫生作到了清洁整齐。食堂、宿舍和托儿所卫生搞的也很好，炊事人员懂得营养知识，饭菜花样就有四十多种，可以作到二十天不吃重样饭。
    安全卫生工作也很突出，伤亡事故很少，今年上半年只有一个重伤、二十五个轻伤病人。全矿出现了许多安全生产小组，其中一个月到半年的有三十个小组，半年到一年的有十个小组，二年和五年以上的有三个小组，马长法生产小组已保持了六年无事故。
    该矿的安全卫生工作能够取得以上成就，主要有以下几个原因：
    一、矿领导善于总结经验，接受教训：该矿1953年以前卫生状况很差，到处是荒草坡和瓦砖堆，职工发病率很高，出勤率很低，每年夏季都有肠道传染病流行。1953年前职工最高出勤率仅为88.8％，发病率8.44％。1953年夏秋有80％职工得了痢疾和肠胃炎，休工达二万五千五百六十四个工作日，等于七十个工人一年未劳动，对生产和职工健康影响甚大。该矿领导从这个历史教训中深深感到保护职工健康作好安全卫生工作是保证生产的重要条件之一。党委把卫生工作列进议事日程，纳入生产计划，作为一项重要评比条件。党委布置生产就布置卫生，检查生产就检查卫生，使卫生工作和生产紧紧结合在一起。由于领导重视，抓得紧，从1954年以来卫生状况一年比一年好，生产效率也一年比一年高，年年超额完成生产任务。1954年发病率比1953年降低了50％，因病缺勤率降低了46％，出勤率提高了6.2％。1958年大跃进中生产任务虽然很紧，该矿领导对安全卫生不但没有放松，反而抓的更紧，1958年发病率比1953年降低了90％，因病缺勤率降低了88％，出勤率达到96.5％，提高了9.4％。
    二、铁矿的领导干部有着相当好的群众工作与部队工作的优良传统：该矿的党委书记、矿长都是长期做党的工作的干部，副矿长是从部队转业的老干部，有着丰富的群众工作与部队工作经验。他们把生产当作一条战线，把工人当作战士，把自己当作群众一员。党委书记、矿长就像部队的指挥员一样，处处起模范作用，事事以身作则，带头遵守劳动纪律，认真执行卫生制度。领导干部上山都打裹腿，戴安全帽。党委书记、矿长都参加卫生突击队，各负责一个厕所的卫生工作，打扫得清洁整齐，受到了全体职工的赞扬，影响很大。他们对待工人的安全卫生、生活福利就像部队首长爱护战士的健康和生活一样，副矿长每天都上山视察生产、安全卫生等工作一到二次。他们这种处处关心工人的工作作风，对推动生产和搞好安全卫生工作起到了巨大作用。
    三、铁矿领导干部团结一致，分工合作：由于党委书记、矿长团结一致，所以上下干部也团结一致。任何措施党委作出决定后，领导干部就一起动手，雷厉风行，坚决贯彻。矿内有一名副矿长分工负责安全卫生工作，但是所有领导干部都能把安全卫生工作看作是生产的重要条件，列入计划，认真执行。因而卫生工作在该矿已经做到经常化，制度化。如遇有疾病流行，更能采取断然措施，发动群众，进行突击。例如1959年1月6日该矿开始流行麻疹、百日咳、流行性感冒等传染病，党委立即采取措施，深入发动群众，屋内和集体场所普遍消毒，生活区每天清扫洒水。医院组织了突击队，分片包干，送药上门，有三千五百二十四人服了预防药。工人们组织防疫宣传突击队，召开小型座谈会或登门拜访，在全矿区内展开了声势浩大的宣传运动。因此，做到了在疾病流行期间内小孩不去俱乐部看戏，不到街上乱窜。仅仅用了十四天时间就控制了传染病的流行，并隔离治疗了全部病人。
    四、贯彻预防为主方针很明确：该矿根据几年来发病情况和季节特点，找到了一般发病规律。因此，对预防工作抓得及时，他们除努力做好平时卫生工作外，在春季预防麻疹、百日咳、猩红热时，对易感儿普遍服用紫草糖、紫草汤、雷击散等药物；夏、秋季预防痢疾、伤寒等肠道传染病，服用痢疾噬菌体，注射伤寒疫苗，预防流行性感冒服银翘汤。每年春季就开始进行防暑降温的准备工作。他们的防暑降温用品每年都能保证供应。矿长去北京、天津等地开会，也不忘记购买矿区所需药品。每年医药费有很大比例都花在预防疾病开支上，1957年预防经费就占全年医药费的11.8％；这些预防经费的使用范围很广，有防暑用的盐汽水、夏茶、冰棍、降温带，有消毒用的药物六六六、滴滴涕，有预防传染病的各种药品，也用于购买蝇拍、扫帚，甚至连鼓励小孩打苍蝇发给的冰棍也在医药费内开支。他们认为贯彻预防为主，多在预防工作上花钱是很大的节省。因而他们的预防措施，既坚决，又彻底。
    五、采用群众路线的工作方法，放手发动群众：该矿领导在各项工作中都能够大胆发动群众，依靠群众，遇事同群众共同商量，共同解决。今年上半年通过发动群众提出的合理化建议，就有二千零二十五件，给国家创造财富达三百十七万元。矿领导根据群众建议，着重抓住了七大关键。其中除六大关键是生产问题外，有一大关键就是安全卫生问题。他们明确提出要做到确保安全，全部改建保险闸，做好防暑降温的一切准备工作，大力开展除害灭病运动，及时扑灭流行病。
    各生产小组普遍建立了九大员：卫生员、安全员、保勤员、工具保管员、质量检查员、合理化建议员、成本核算员、宣传鼓动员、保卫员。卫生员负责急救处理和防病防伤工作。安全员负责安全设备的检查、宣传、评比等工作。这些群众组织作用很大，有力地保证了安全生产。每年暑季，他们还把工人临时休息的权利下放到生产小组，小组根据生产和工人的健康情况，可以决定工人暂时休息。这个措施受到工人的普遍拥护，效果很好。由于矿领导采用了群众路线的工作方法，所以在每次开展卫生工作中，都能顺利进行。只要领导提出措施，工人就能立即行动起来。在历次卫生运动中都涌现出大批卫生积极分子和模范人物（仅1958年就有一百十二个卫生积极分子和三个模范单位），他们对推动卫生工作起到了很大作用。
    六、宣传教育工作深入：新工人入矿普遍受三天训练，参观现场。参加生产后严格固定工种、工地。对新工人的生产和安全教育，由老工人分工包干负责；采取以老带新的办法，老工人关心新工人就像部队老战士关心新战士一样。该矿领导还善于抓住事故典型例子，向全体工人进行教育。今年上半年结合安全生产大检查，进行了规模较大的安全活动二十四次。全面贯彻并修改了安全技术操作规程，建立与健全了安全责任制，大部分职工受到了教育，提高了认识和技术水平。因此，5月份比4月份工伤事故就降低了68.5％。
    在职工及家属中间普及卫生知识和进行除害灭病的宣传教育工作，做的也很深入。该矿的除四害指挥部和党委宣传部共同负责这项工作，广泛利用一切宣传工具，如图书馆、俱乐部、黑板报、宣传车、漫画、大字报、广播、图片、展览会等，以及利用各种会议的机会，进行卫生宣传。医院医生还负责组织职工和家属进行卫生知识讲座或漫谈，内容有：消灭四害、环境卫生、工业卫生、妇幼卫生、预防多发病等。对炊事员、保育员、接生员，普遍进行卫生训练。此外，医院还组成宣传队深入工人宿舍及家属村进行宣传，深受群众欢迎。通过一系列的宣传教育活动，使职工及家属的卫生知识水平普遍有了提高，一般都懂得了做好卫生工作对保护健康和保证生产的重要意义。卫生工作在工人中间，特别是老工人中间，已经成为良好的习惯。
    七、治标与治本工作结合的好：安全生产、超额完成国家任务，是他们的努力目标。为了实现这个目标，该矿领导紧紧抓住了七大工程，从根本上来解决安全生产问题。在除害灭病工作方面，他们也做了很多治本工作。如扩大预防，普及卫生知识，改善劳动条件等。同时，通过一系列的卫生运动，积累了丰富经验，在生产和生活的各个方面都建立了健全的卫生制度和管理办法。如有卫生区域负责制，街道、宿舍轮流清扫制，食堂用具定期消毒制，以及托儿所、理发室、澡塘、厕所等管理办法共十一种。
    磁山铁矿的卫生工作成绩是巨大的，经验是丰富的，值得各地学习。但该矿并不自满，他们将要在胜利基础上继续前进，今年的安全卫生工作规划，是在贯彻安全生产和预防为主的方针下制定的，要求做到：（1）采取综合措施消灭职业病；（2）在已消灭的五种疾病基础上，进一步争取消灭性病和痢疾，大力控制麻疹和流行性感冒；（3）彻底实现“五化”。群众的口号是：鼠雀不提，蚊蝇绝迹，实现“五化”，保住光荣红旗。
