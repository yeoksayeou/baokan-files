    Jade Dew on Barren滩
    Su Fang
    We strolled along a small dirt road in the Qiligou Orchard of Xuzhou. This straight path was entirely covered by grape trellises, resembling a green corridor. Outside, the midday sun scorched the skin; inside, it was cool and refreshing. The strands of sunlight filtering through the large leaves became a soft, white glow, completely losing their intensity. Strings of pearl-like grapes hung above our heads. The tender branches with their tendrils, like mischievous children's hands, would occasionally clutch at our hair or tug at our clothes. We had to carefully avoid them. The owners cultivated them with such care, how could we damage them!
    Passing through the grape corridor, we entered the apple and peach tree groves. The fruit trees were arranged in rows. The spaces between the rows were planted with low-growing bean crops. The yellow soil was almost completely hidden. Looking out, it was an endless green sea. A warm southerly wind blew, carrying the rich fragrance of melons and fruits. The green sea surged in waves, and the numerous ball-shaped fruits hidden in the thick shade revealed their pinkish-white, pale-yellow, or slightly red tender faces, shyly glancing and smiling at us.
    What a beautiful picture, what an abundant scene! Standing in such an environment, it would be hard to imagine the past barren and desolate appearance of this place. Well then, let's hear what the head of the orchard has to say!
    This is a sandy wasteland left behind after the Yellow River changed its course. Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces all have such sandy wastelands. For a long time, this land was abandoned and nothing grew. But today, how can people who love every inch of the motherland bear to see it unused, how can they not try every possible means to use it to increase the wealth of the motherland? So, in 1952, the people of Xuzhou made a bold decision to establish an orchard on this sandy wasteland within their territory, planting apple, pear, peach, and other fruit trees.
    Building an orchard on a sandy wasteland was a new task; planting apple trees in the orchard was also a new task. Most people thought that apples were deciduous fruit trees of the north and were not suitable for planting in Xuzhou, where the climate is quite hot. In the past, there were only a few slender apple trees in a small private garden in the entire city of Xuzhou, and they occasionally bore a few small, lumpy apples that tasted soft and fluffy like cotton, bland and tasteless; but because of the high cultivation value of apples, people now wanted to plant them in large quantities in the orchard.
    People got to work!
    The first step was to level the land. The wind rolled up piles of sand, forming hills in some places and depressions in others. To build an orchard, it was necessary to level the sand dunes, fill in the depressions, and, in areas with particularly poor soil quality, to carry soil from nearby fields to mix it in. The workers hauled the sand, chanting "heave-ho, heave-ho." To carry more, they combined two carrying poles into one. The gale howled. The workers worked barefoot on the sand, and the shoes they had taken off beside them disappeared in the blink of an eye. Where did they go? They were buried by the wind-blown yellow sand. The mischievous wind and sand not only hid their shoes but also attacked their bodies, blocking their nostrils and blinding their eyes; when they ate, they crunched and crackled in their mouths, as sand had also gotten in… People stood tall, fearlessly fighting against nature. It was not easy to level the land, not easy to plant pears and peaches, not easy to plant the first batch of apple seedlings! Seedlings, ah, people patiently watered and fertilized you, may you grow quickly; but the apple seedlings, which were of most concern, withered silently! They failed, but were not discouraged. People explored why the apple seedlings could not survive and finally found many reasons, such as the seedlings were transported from far away, poorly packaged, the roots had fallen off, and lacked moisture; such as the nature of the soil was not well understood, and apple seedlings were planted in places not suitable for growing apples… Having learned from the failure, people planted the second batch of apple seedlings. The seedlings grew like healthy babies. Spring came, and they blossomed. Pale pear blossoms, pink apple blossoms, delicate red peach blossoms, balls and clusters, shone with dazzling light under the sun; autumn came, and they bore fruit, and the plump fruits emitted an intoxicating fragrance. People excitedly shouted in unison: "Success! Success!"
    How much people cherish the fruits they cultivated with their own hands, how much they love the orchard they built with their own hands! During the fruit ripening season, the workers moved their beds into the forest and slept there at night to make it easier to guard and care for their little treasures: bananas, apples, pears, Jade Dew peaches… A worker named Zhang Hengjun wandered through the forest all day long, and he knew how many fruits were on each tree. Losing a fruit was as painful as losing a priceless gem.
    Strolling through the orchard, everything felt fresh and interesting. Have you ever seen peaches wearing clothes? Each small fruit was covered with a thin paper bag. This was to prevent oriental fruit moths, fearing that they would sneak into the peaches from the outside and steal the fruit. Why were red ribbons tied to those trees? It turned out that those were fruit trees that had just been sprayed with insecticide, and the ribbons were specially marked to facilitate checking the death of the insects. Passing by the nursery, the thriving apple seedlings swayed in the breeze and nodded to us. Their tender leaves were as lustrous and beautiful as jade. Apple seedlings generally need to be three years old before they can be removed from the nursery. The apple seedlings in the Qiligou Orchard are now being removed after only two years, and they are now experimenting with removing them after one year. This batch of early-grafted apple seedlings is growing very quickly and is already eighteen centimeters tall. The head of the orchard pointed this way and that, modestly and proudly saying to us: "We have no experience, we are just exploring and creating at the same time, in short, we must do everything possible to increase production for the country."
    As the sun set, we sat beside the melon field to rest. The orchard owner brought watermelon and cantaloupe to entertain us. We sipped the honey juice of the watermelon and chatted. The head of the orchard told us that the construction of the Qiligou Orchard proved that the sandy wasteland of the old course of the Yellow River can be utilized. Now Anhui, Henan, and Shandong have also begun to establish orchards on this abandoned land. In the future, there will be a fruit forest belt several thousand miles long on the old course of the Yellow River. Listening to his words, we seemed to see a green wall built of fruit trees, stretching on and on, all the way to the horizon… We could not help but cheer excitedly. The cicadas and birds chirped in the branches, as if they were also singing praises for the beautiful future.

    荒滩玉露

    我们漫步在徐州七里沟果园的一条小土路上。这条笔直的小路全部被葡萄架复盖着，宛如一道绿色的长廊。外面，正午的太阳灼得人皮肤发痛；里面却是清凉清凉的。透过阔大的叶片飘洒进来的一丝丝阳光，变得白洋洋的，完全失去威力了。成串的珍珠般的葡萄粒在我们头上悬挂着。带有卷须的嫩枝像调皮的孩子的小手，不时攀住我们的头发，牵住我们的衣角。我们不得不小心地闪躲着。主人那样精心地培育它们，我们又怎能损伤它们呢！
    转过葡萄廊，便进入苹果树、桃树丛中了。果树一行行地排列着。行间的空地上，种上了低矮的豆类作物。黄色的土地被掩盖得几乎看不见了。放眼望去，是一片无边无际的绿色的海洋。暖洋洋的南风吹过，送来了瓜果浓郁的芳香。绿色的海洋掀起了波浪，隐藏在浓荫中的累累成球的果实，便露出了它们粉白的、淡黄的或者微红的嫩脸，羞怯地向我们瞥视、微笑。
    多么美妙的图画，多么丰盛的景象！置身在这样的环境之中，你一定难以想像出过去这儿的贫瘠荒凉的面貌。那么，请听听果园负责人的介绍吧！
    这儿是黄河改道后遗留下来的一片沙荒地。这样的沙荒地江苏、河南、山东、安徽几省都有。长期以来，这种土地被荒废着，寸草不生。可是，在今天，热爱祖国每一寸土的人们怎么能看着它废置不用，怎么能不千方百计地利用它来为祖国增加财富？于是，在1952年，徐州市的人民作出了大胆的决定，要在自己境内这片沙荒滩上建立果园，种植苹果、梨、桃等果树。
    沙荒滩上建果园，这是个新的课题；果园里要种上苹果树，这同样是个新的课题。一般人都以为：苹果是北方的落叶果木，在徐州这气候相当炎热的地方不宜于栽种。过去，整个徐州市只有一个私人小花园里长着几株细条条的苹果树，偶尔结出几个小疙瘩苹果，嚼起来也像棉花一样软泡泡的淡而无味；可是因为苹果的栽培价值高，现在人们却要在果园里大量种植了。
    人们干起来了！
    第一步工作是平地。大风把沙土一堆一堆地卷起，有的地方形成了丘陵，有的地方出现了洼地。要建果园，先得把沙丘削平，洼地填满，而且土质特别坏的地方，还需要从附近地里抬土来揉合进去。工人们嗬唷嗬唷地抬着沙土奔走着。为了多抬一些，他们把两根扛子并成一根用。狂风呼喇喇地刮着。工人们赤着脚在沙地上工作，而脱在身边的鞋子，一转眼就失踪了。那儿去了？原来被风刮起的黄沙掩埋起来了。捉弄人的风沙不但藏起他们的鞋，还向他们的身体袭击，堵住了他们的鼻孔，迷住了他们的眼；吃饭的时候，嘴里嚼起来咔嚓咔嚓的响，原来沙子也钻了进去……人们挺着胸脯，无畏地跟大自然搏斗着。好容易平整了土地，好容易种下了梨桃，好容易种下了第一批苹果苗！树苗啊，人们耐心地给你浇水施肥，你快快长大吧；可是，那最使人关心的苹果苗却无声地枯萎了！失败了，没有灰心。人们探索着为什么苹果苗不能成活，终于找出了许多原因，譬如，这批果苗是从远地运来的，包装不好，根须掉了，缺少水分；譬如对土壤的性质不够了解，在不适合种苹果的地方种上了苹果苗……接受了失败的教训，人们又种下了第二批苹果苗。幼苗像健壮的婴儿一样成长着。春天来了，开花了。淡白的梨花，粉色的苹果花，娇红的桃花，一球球，一簇簇，在阳光的照耀下闪射着耀眼的光芒；秋天来了，结果了，肥嫩的果子喷吐出醉人的芳香。人们兴奋地异口同声地嚷出：“成功了！成功了！”
    人们多么珍惜自己用双手栽培起来的果实，多么心爱自己用双手建立起来的果园啊！果子成熟的季节，工人都把床搬到林子里，夜间便在那里睡觉，为了便于看守、照扶自己的小宝贝：香蕉、苹果、巴梨、玉露桃……一个叫张恒君的工人，成天在林子里游转，哪棵树上结了多少果子，他心里都有数。丢失了一个果子，他就像丢失了一颗夜明珠一样心疼。
    漫步果林，处处感到新鲜有趣。你看到过桃子穿衣裳么？一个个小果儿都被薄薄的纸袋套了起来。这是为了防止食心虫，怕它从外面钻到桃子心里去偷吃果子。为什么那些树上系着红色的飘带？原来那是才喷过杀虫药水的果树，为了便于检查虫子死亡的情况，特地给它做了标记。经过苗圃的时候，茁壮的苹果苗在微风中摇摆着向我们点头。它的稚嫩的叶片像翡翠一样莹泽美丽。苹果苗一般要过三年才能出圃。七里沟果园的苹果苗却已提前为两年出圃，现在又在试验提前到一年出圃。这批提早嫁接的苹果苗长得很快，现在已经有十八厘米高了。果园负责人一面指点我们看这看那，一面谦逊而又自豪地对我们说：“我们没有经验，只是一面摸索，一面创造，总之要千方百计为国家增产。”
    太阳偏西时，我们坐在瓜田旁边憩息。果园主人捧来西瓜、甜瓜招待我们。我们一面啜饮着西瓜的蜜汁，一面闲谈着。果园负责人告诉我们，七里沟果园的建成，证明黄河故道的沙荒地是可以利用的。现在安徽、河南和山东也已经着手在这废弃不用的地上建立果园了。将来黄河故道上会出现几千里长的果林带。谛听着他的话，我们眼前好像出现了一道果树筑成的绿色的围墙，它绵亘着，绵亘着，一直伸到天边……我们不禁振奋得高声欢笑起来。枝头蝉鸣鸟叫，它们似乎也在为美好的未来唱着赞歌哩。
