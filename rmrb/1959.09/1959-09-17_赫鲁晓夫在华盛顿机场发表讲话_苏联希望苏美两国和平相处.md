TASS, Washington dispatch: Following is the full text of the speech delivered by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, at the airport in Washington on September 15 upon arriving in the US capital:
    Mr. President! Ladies and gentlemen!
    Allow me, at the moment of first setting foot on American soil, to express my gratitude to Mr. Eisenhower, who invited us to visit your country, and to all those who have come to warmly welcome our Soviet representatives.
    Russians often say, "Every good deed must begin in the morning." We took off from Moscow this morning, and we are very happy to be able to meet you on American soil on the same morning. You see, the distance between our two countries is not so far anymore.
    I accepted with great satisfaction and gratitude the kind invitation of the President of the United States to pay an official visit to your country, and I will be very happy to talk with national leaders, business people, intellectuals, and workers and farmers to understand the life of the hardworking and enterprising American people.
    On our part, we will be very happy to welcome Mr. Eisenhower, his family, and entourage to the Soviet Union soon. We will treat the President with the utmost hospitality and give him ample opportunity to understand the life of the Soviet people.
    We have always believed that it is very beneficial for representatives of various countries to visit each other and hold meetings. It is of particular significance for the leaders of our two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, to meet and talk.
    People of all countries are deeply concerned about defending and consolidating peace, and about peaceful coexistence. War will not bring any benefit to anyone, while peace is beneficial to all people. We believe that national leaders should follow this basic principle and realize the wishes of the people of all countries.
    We come to you with sincere hearts and good wishes. The Soviet people hope to live in peace and friendship with the American people.
    There are no obstacles that can prevent the relations between our two countries from being established as good-neighborly relations. The people of the Soviet Union and the United States, along with the people of other countries, fought side by side very well against a common enemy during World War II and defeated the enemy. In a peaceful environment, the people of our two countries have even more reason and more possibility to be friendly and cooperate.
    Mr. President, we are pleased that Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers launched a lunar rocket before our meeting. This has opened the road from Earth to the Moon. A container weighing 390 kilograms, engraved with the Soviet national emblem, has now been left on the Moon. Our Earth is now a little lighter, and the Moon is now heavier by a few hundred kilograms. I believe that this historical achievement of peaceful science pleases not only the Soviet people, but also all those who cherish peace and friendship among the people of all countries.
    The Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker has recently been launched. We are pleased that this concrete manifestation of the hope of the people of all countries to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes is realized.
    Mr. President, we know that you are deeply attached to the idea of ​​peaceful use of atomic energy, and we are pleased to point out that your goals and ours coincide in this regard.
    We have no doubt that the outstanding American scientists, engineers, and workers who are working on conquering the universe will also send their marks to the Moon. The Soviet marks will welcome your marks as old residents of the Moon, and they will live in peace and friendship, just as we should live in peace and friendship on Earth, just as the people of all countries living on our common mother, Earth, should live in peace and friendship, for the Earth so generously rewards us with its talents.
    At this moment of just arriving in the United States, please allow me to express warm greetings and best wishes to the American people.

    The US Secretary of State and the Soviet Foreign Minister will meet at the State Department at ten o'clock on the morning of September 16 to exchange views on the upcoming talks between US President Eisenhower and Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

    苏联希望苏美两国和平相处
    本报讯　塔斯社华盛顿讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫15日在到达美国首都华盛顿时在机场发表的讲话，全文如下：总统先生！诸位女士，诸位先生！
    请允许我在第一次踏上美国国土的时刻，向邀请我们来贵国访问的艾森豪威尔先生，向所有前来热烈欢迎我们苏联代表的人们表示感谢。
    俄国人常常说：“每件好事都必须从清早做起”。我们今天早上从莫斯科起飞，我们感到很高兴就在同一天的早上能在美国的土地上同你们相会。你们看，我们两国之间的距离已经不是那么远了。
    我非常满意和十分感激地接受了美国总统邀请我来贵国作正式访问的盛意，我将很高兴同国家领导人、工商界人士、知识分子以及工人和农民交谈，了解勤劳和富有进取心的美国人民的生活。
    在我们这方面，我们将非常高兴不久就在苏联欢迎艾森豪威尔先生及其家属和随行人员。我们将最殷勤地款待总统，并且使他有充分的机会了解苏联人民的生活。
    我们一向认为各国的代表们相互访问和举行会晤很有好处。我们苏美两大国国家领导人举行会晤和交谈有着特别重大的意义。
    各国人民都深切关怀保卫和巩固和平，关怀和平共处。战争不会对任何人带来任何好处，而和平则有利于各国人民。我们认为，各国国家领导人应该遵循这一基本原则，实现各国人民的愿望。
    我们怀着坦率的心和美好的愿望来到你们这里。苏联人民希望同美国人民和平友好相处。
    没有任何障碍能够阻挡我们两国的关系，建立成睦邻关系。苏美两国人民和其他国家人民在第二次世界大战期间曾经很好地并肩作战反对共同的敌人，击溃敌人。在和平的环境中，我们两国人民更有理由、更有可能友好和合作。
    总统先生，在我们会晤之前，苏联科学家、工程师、技术员和工人发射了月球火箭，这使我们感到高兴。这样就开辟了从地球到月球的道路。上面镌有苏联国徽的、重三百九十公斤的容器现在已经留在月球上了。我们地球现在轻了一些，而月球现在重了几百公斤。我相信，和平科学这一历史成就不仅使苏联人民，而且使一切珍视和平和各国人民友谊的人感到高兴。
    苏联的原子破冰船最近已经下水。各国人民希望把核能只用于和平目的的这一具体表现使我们感到高兴。
    总统先生，我们知道，您对和平利用原子能的主张是感到亲切的，我们满意地指出，在这方面你们的目的和我们是吻合的。
    我们不怀疑，在征服宇宙方面进行工作的美国杰出的科学家、工程师和工人也会把自己的标记送上月球。苏联的标记将作为月球的老住户而欢迎贵国标记，它们将和平友好相处，就像我们在地球上应该和平友好相处一样，就像居住在我们共同的母亲——地球上的各国人民应当和平友好相处一样，地球如此慷慨地用自己的天赋来奖励我们。
    在刚刚到达美国的这一时刻，请允许我向美国人民表达热情的问候和最好的愿望。
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社华盛顿16日讯：此间公布了关于葛罗米柯和赫脱即将举行会晤的联合声明。全文如下：
