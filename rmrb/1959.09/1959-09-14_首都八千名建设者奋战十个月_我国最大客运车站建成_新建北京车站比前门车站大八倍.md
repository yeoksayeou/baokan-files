Eight Thousand Builders in the Capital Work Hard for Ten Months
China's Largest Passenger Station Completed
New Beijing Station Eight Times Larger Than Qianmen Station

(Reported by our newspaper) Beijing Station, currently the largest passenger station in China, has been basically completed and handed over for use.

The main structure of this station is eight times larger than the old Beijing Station—Qianmen Station’s station building. In front of the building is a plaza that can accommodate 50,000 people, and behind it are elevated overpasses for passengers entering the station, three underpasses, six platforms, and twelve railway tracks, with a construction area of more than 80,000 square meters. When the station's equipment capacity is fully utilized, it can handle about 200 pairs of trains and 200,000 passengers every day.

Construction of this project began in January of this year. Such a massive project would normally require at least one year for design and two years for construction. However, under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, and through the efforts of more than eight thousand builders, it took only ten months from design to completion.

The builders from the First Construction Engineering Office directly under the Ministry of Railways, the Beijing Railway Bureau Engineering Section, and the Fifth Engineering Office of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau, who were responsible for this project, displayed a high degree of revolutionary drive during the construction process. The circular arch thin shell of the central hall was the key to the entire project. Its length and width are each 35 meters, but its thickness is only one and a half bricks, with a complex structure and high technical requirements. During the construction process, workers and technicians adopted the method of "Zhuge Liang Meetings" to overcome the three difficulties of supporting formwork, transporting steel bars, and pouring concrete, completing the project ten days ahead of the original Great Leap Forward plan, with first-class quality.

During the construction process, the project received support from more than 17,000 workers and technicians from thirteen provinces and cities across the country. More than 100 factories in Shanghai and other places processed and manufactured equipment for it.

This station was jointly designed by the teachers and students of the Beijing First Industrial Design Institute and the Department of Architecture and the Department of Structural Engineering of Nanjing Institute of Technology. It also received assistance from the Lu Xun Academy of Arts and the Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. (Attached Picture)

    首都八千名建设者奋战十个月
    我国最大客运车站建成
    新建北京车站比前门车站大八倍
    本报讯　我国目前最大的客运车站——北京车站，现已基本建成并交付使用。
    构成这个车站的主要工程，比旧北京车站——前门车站的车站大楼大八倍。大楼前面是一个能容纳五万人的广场，后面是旅客入站的高架天桥、三条地道、六个月台和十二条铁路股道，建筑面积八万多平方米。车站的设备能力完全发挥出来后，每天能接发列车二百对左右，接送二十万旅客。
    这项工程是在今年1月动工兴建的。这样浩大的工程，在通常情况下，至少需要设计一年，施工两年。但在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，经过八千多名建设者的努力，从设计到建成，总共只用了十个月时间。
    担负这项工程的铁道部直属第一建筑工程处、北京铁路局工程段和武汉大桥工程局第五工程处的建设者们，在施工过程中，发挥了高度的革命干劲。中央大厅的圆拱薄壳，是整个工程的关键。它的长度和宽度各为三十五米，而厚度只有一块半砖那样厚，结构复杂，技术要求高。在施工过程中，工人和技术人员采用“诸葛亮会议”的办法，克服支模板、运钢筋和浇灌混凝土三道难关，比原订的跃进计划提前十天竣工，质量达到一级品。
    建设过程中，得到了全国十三个省、市一万七千多名工人和技术人员的支援。为它加工制造设备的有上海等地的一百多个工厂。
    这个车站是北京第一工业设计院和南京工学院建筑系、结构系师生共同设计的。并且得到鲁迅艺术学院、建筑工程部科学研究院的帮助。（附图片）
