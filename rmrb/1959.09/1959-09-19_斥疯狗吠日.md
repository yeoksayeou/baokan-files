    Reprimanding Mad Dogs Barking at the Sun
  　Liao Mengxing
  The imperialist running dogs and agents,
  Recently, they've been barking like a pack of mad dogs, saying we crush the people like "wooden sticks,"
  Saying our Eighth Plenary Session documents are "distressing," our Great Leap Forward displeases them,
  Viciously slandering, cursing, and clamoring. But we will celebrate the establishment of the communes,
  We will sing the praises of the goodness of our socialism. We are willing to dedicate our lives to socialism,
  Why would we begrudge this bit of our hard work? But saying we are like "wooden sticks" may have a grain of truth,
  Because we will never bow down to you imperialists. We women even more welcome socialist construction,
  Believing that the commune is good for us in every way. Nurseries, public canteens, and other collective welfare,
  Have driven away the distress of us being unable to find employment, not to mention the joy of us now happily working together,
  Even lonely widowers and widows have places to grow old. We are happy with our leap forward in all aspects,
  It is not "premature" in any way. The slogan of "Surpassing England" is not an empty phrase,
  You will know it in less than ten years. Our expectations will be steadily achieved,
  Because six hundred and fifty million people are working hard for it. Let you slander, curse, and scold,
  Imperialists and running dogs! Our glorious achievements will be just as great,
  Forward, forward, leap is still leap, no matter how many mad dogs bark at the sun,
  The sun's radiance will never cease its brilliance.

    斥疯狗吠日
  　廖梦醒帝国主义的走狗和代理人，
  最近像一群疯狗乱叫，说我们把人民压得像“木棒”，
  说我们八中全会文件“令人苦恼”，我们的跃进他们看了不高兴，
  恶毒地诬蔑诅咒和叫嚣。可是我们就是要庆祝公社的成立，
  就是要歌颂我们的社会主义好。为社会主义连生命献出也愿意，
  难道还吝惜我们这点儿辛劳？不过说我们像“木棒”也许有半点儿对，
  因为我们绝不会向你帝国主义弯腰。我们妇女更加欢迎社会主义建设，
  认为公社对我们样样都好。托儿所、公共食堂等等集体福利，
  赶走了我们不能就业的苦恼，别说我们现在高高兴兴地一同劳动的快乐，
  就是孤苦伶仃的鳏夫寡妇也有地方养老。我们高兴我们各方面的跃进，
  并不怎样“为时过早”。“超英”的口号不是句空话，
  你们不到十年就会知道。我们的预期是会稳当到手，
  因为有六亿五千万人为它辛劳。任你诬蔑吧，诅咒吧，骂吧，
  帝国主义者和走狗！我们光辉的成就将一样伟大，
  前进的前进，飞跃的还是飞跃，不论你多少疯狗吠日，
  太阳的光辉绝不会停止它的辉耀。
