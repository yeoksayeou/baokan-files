Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: The Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong reports that at today's meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side, acting on the orders of the Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding a series of recent actions by the US side that have flagrantly violated the armistice agreement, and strongly demanded that the US side thoroughly investigate these facts, severely punish the criminals, and take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side first raised the issue of US armed personnel attacking residents of northern Korea: On August 5th of this year, at approximately 24:00 Korean time, five US armed personnel intruded into the Korean-Chinese side's military control area near Kosong on the East Sea, attacked civilian houses, stabbed two women with daggers, and then kidnapped 55-year-old Xu Junye to a location near 38 degrees 39 minutes 40 seconds North latitude and 128 degrees 20 minutes 0 seconds East longitude, where they killed him. Two rifles, one automatic rifle, and other items discarded by the US armed personnel were found at the scene of the incident.

The US Secretary was unable to deny this obvious crime, and prevaricated, saying that measures would be taken after an investigation.

The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side then protested to the US side regarding the incident of US military aircraft intruding into the airspace over the Korean-Chinese side's area. He pointed out that on August 27th of this year, at approximately 11:00 Korean time, a US military jet aircraft passed over the US side's military control area of ​​Munju Mountain, crossed the Han River estuary, and intruded into the Korean-Chinese side's military control area of ​​Tanpu for reconnaissance before flying back to the US side's area.

The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side also protested against the US shooting incidents in the demilitarized zone. According to the materials he revealed, on July 9th and July 24th, US armed personnel, carrying carbines, twice intruded into the US side of the demilitarized zone and fired at the Korean-Chinese side of the demilitarized zone, even shooting at the Korean-Chinese side's civil police.

Faced with the conclusive facts and solemn protests pointed out by the Korean-Chinese side, the US Secretary was unable to justify his illegal actions. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜停战委员会双方秘书长举行会议
    我方强硬抗议美方违反协定
    新华社平壤31日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：在今天举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长根据朝中方面首席委员的命令，就美方最近粗暴地违反停战协定的一系列行动向美方提出了严重抗议，并且强烈要求美方彻底调查这些事实，严格处罚罪犯，和采取有效措施保证不再发生类似事件。
    朝中方面秘书长首先提出美方武装人员袭击朝鲜北部居民的事件：今年8月5日朝鲜时间二十四时许，美方武装人员五名在东海侵入朝中方面军事控制地区高城附近，袭击民房，用短刀刺伤两名妇女，然后把五十五岁的老人徐俊烨绑架到北纬三十八度三十九分四十秒、东经一百二十度二十分零秒附近，把他杀死了。发生这一事件的现场上还有美方武装人员扔掉的步枪两支、自动枪一支和其他物品。
    美方秘书长无法否认这件明显的罪行，推托说要在调查后采取措施。
    朝中方面秘书长接着就美方军用飞机侵入朝中方面地区上空事件向美方提出抗议。他指出，今年8月27日朝鲜时间十一时许，美方的一架军用喷气式飞机经由美方军事控制区文珠山上空，越过汉江口，侵入朝中方面军事控制区滩浦上空，在进行侦察后飞回美方地区。
    朝中方面秘书长还就在非军事区发生的美方枪击事件提出抗议。根据他所揭露的材料，7月9日和7月24日，美方武装人员带着卡宾枪两次侵入非军事区美方地区，向非军事区朝中方面地区开枪，甚至对朝中方面的民政警察进行射击。
    美方秘书长在朝中方面指出的确凿的事实面前和严正的抗议下，无法为自己的非法行为进行辩解。（附图片）
