    Fulfill the Production Target of 12 Million Tons of Steel Ahead of Schedule!
    "Fulfill the production target of 12 million tons of steel this year ahead of schedule!" This is the ambitious declaration of millions of steelworkers across the country, responding to the Party's great call after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. All employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have already issued a challenge to steel enterprises across the country on August 28th. They guarantee to complete the annual steel production plan ten days ahead of schedule, the annual steel material production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule, and correspondingly overfulfill and complete the production tasks of pig iron, ore, coke, refractory materials, etc. ahead of schedule, and guarantee to complete the quality, variety, and cost indicators. Steelworkers in Shanghai have proposed to overfulfill the annual steel production plan by 70,000 to 150,000 tons. Steelworkers in Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Taiyuan, and other places have also expressed their determination to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. The goal that China's steelworkers have chosen for themselves is no longer to complete this year's production task of 12 million tons of steel on schedule, but to complete it ahead of schedule and overfulfill it! This great goal is encouraging millions of heroic sons and daughters on the steel front to work hard and cleverly, and a new upsurge in steel production has arrived. After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, steel production has grown rapidly in the past few days. On August 31st, the national steel production increased by 23.8% compared with the average daily output in early August, and by 10.3% compared with the average daily output in mid-August. On this day, the production of pig iron also increased by 26.9% compared with the average daily output in early August, and by 17.8% compared with the average daily output in mid-August. This is a great leap on the steel production front, which powerfully shows that the Party's great call has become a huge material force. Now, judging from the current situation, as long as we continue to consolidate and further develop the achievements that have been made, it is definitely possible to complete and overfulfill the task of producing 12 million tons of steel this year.
    Of course, completing and overfulfilling the task of producing 12 million tons of steel this year is not an easy task. We know that during the First Five-Year Plan, China's steel production increased by a total of four million tons (from 1.35 million tons in 1952 to 5.35 million tons in 1957), with an average annual net increase of 800,000 tons, and an average annual growth rate of 31.7%. This speed once shocked the capitalist world. And this year, China's steel production will increase by another four million tons on the basis of last year's eight million tons of steel, using one year to increase the output that could only be increased in five years not long ago. Since the founding of the country, there have been two outstanding high speeds in the history of China's steel industry. One was in 1956, when a high tide of socialist transformation and socialist construction appeared, and the steel production in that year increased by a net of 1,612,000 tons. The other was in 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, when the steel production (excluding indigenous steel) increased by a net of 2.65 million tons. And this year, China's steel production will increase by a net of four million tons, and we must climb a peak higher than the previous two. Vowing to realize this great goal ahead of schedule once again demonstrates the heroic spirit of China's steelworkers, under the leadership of the Party, going all out and aiming high.
    In order to complete and overfulfill the plan to produce 12 million tons of steel this year, the most important thing at present is to oppose right-leaning ideas, boost morale, and carry out the production increase and economy campaign centered on high output, high quality, and low cost. Facts in various places have proved that enterprises and departments where a few cadres originally had right-leaning ideas always showed no improvement in production, or even regressed. Once right-leaning ideas were criticized and morale was boosted, the situation greatly improved. Why could steel production at the end of August increase so greatly compared with the beginning of August? The main reason is that the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party armed people's minds and brought into play the production enthusiasm and creativity of millions of steelworkers. Therefore, as long as we adhere to opposing right-leaning ideas and boosting morale, and adhere to the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on high output, high quality, and low cost, it is entirely possible to further increase the daily output of steel, thereby greatly advancing the completion and overfulfillment of this year's production task of 12 million tons of steel and the production tasks of pig iron and steel materials.
    In the in-depth development of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on high output, high quality, and low cost, vigorously solving the problem of raw materials is a key link. The main raw material for steelmaking is pig iron. To produce more and better quality steel, we must have more and better quality pig iron. To produce more and better quality pig iron, we must have more and better quality coke and ore. At present, the supply of coke and ore is still not abundant enough. This requires all ironmaking units, especially small blast furnace ironmaking units, to vigorously save coke and vigorously increase the output and quality of ore, reduce furnace burden consumption, and improve furnace burden quality. We must also seize the opportunity to wash coal and refine coke and improve ore processing. Countless experiences have proved that using washed coal to refine coke, improving the quality of coke, and reducing the ash and sulfur content of coke can greatly reduce coke consumption and greatly increase the output and quality of pig iron. Carrying out mineral processing, making powdered ore into sintered ore, and crushing the ore to an appropriate particle size can also reduce ore consumption and increase the output and quality of pig iron. The better these tasks are done, the more guaranteed the increase in steel production will be. Of course, this does not mean that steelmaking units should not save pig iron. Saving pig iron is still an important task for steelmaking enterprises. In fact, the potential for steelmaking units to save pig iron is also very large. For example, advanced units consume an average of more than 1,200 kilograms of pig iron per ton of converter steel, while general units require more than 1,500 kilograms, and a few units with the highest consumption require more than 2,000 kilograms. If general units reach the level of advanced units, a very large amount of pig iron can be saved in the next few months.
    Improving the technical level of steel production and steel rolling production cannot be ignored either. In the past year or so since the vigorous mass movement of making steel on a large scale, many effective advanced experiences have emerged in mines, large, medium, and small blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, converters, electric furnaces, and steel rolling production, such as the experience of large blast furnaces in increasing smelting intensity while reducing coke ratio, the advanced experience of small blast furnaces, the experience of steelmaking in charging more, smelting quickly, and strengthening furnace maintenance, the experience of steel rolling in multiple and fast rolling, and so on. Advanced units use these experiences to make their production far ahead, pointing out the way forward for other units. In July, the utilization coefficient of No. 10 large open-hearth furnace of the Second Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company reached 1.48 tons, while the utilization coefficient of general large open-hearth furnaces was 7.82 tons; the utilization coefficient of small open-hearth furnace of No. 3 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company reached 13.23 tons, while the utilization coefficient of general small open-hearth furnaces was 7.62 tons; the utilization coefficient of converter of No. 3 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company reached 20.10 tons, while the utilization coefficient of general converters was 7 tons. In terms of ironmaking, in the first half of the year, the highest monthly average utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces in the First Ironmaking Plant of Benxi reached 2.436 tons, while the utilization coefficient of general large and medium-sized blast furnaces was 1.562 tons; the highest monthly average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in Jiangsu Province reached 0.956 tons, while the utilization coefficient of general small blast furnaces was 0.7 tons. If each unit seriously promotes advanced experience and catches up with advanced levels, steel production will definitely be greatly improved, which is an important measure that cannot be ignored to complete and overfulfill 12 million tons of steel ahead of schedule.
    Strengthening the work of auxiliary departments and weak links is also an important link in improving steel production. For example, in-plant transportation is a very prominent weak link; some steel plants cannot fully exert their production capacity due to the lack of slag discharge and steel discharge lifting and loading equipment. In addition, the rapid completion of some new equipment that needs to be supplemented with parts and components, and the rapid commissioning of some capital construction projects that are responsible for production tasks this year, is also an important aspect of increasing steel production, which must be grasped tightly.
    Completing and overfulfilling the production plan of 12 million tons of steel ahead of schedule is a task for the whole people, and requires strong support from various departments. For example, as mentioned earlier, the problem of raw materials is the most important key link in steel production. However, the problem of raw materials is not just a matter of increasing production and practicing economy, but also a matter of transportation. In some places, the output of coking coal and pig iron is quite large, but because it is not transferred out in time; transportation is sometimes not timely enough, which causes difficulties for some key steelmaking enterprises that do not produce iron and some provinces that lack coal. In order to ensure the completion of the task of transferring coking coal and pig iron, and to ensure that blast furnaces do not lack coal and steel plants do not lack iron, the various provinces and coal departments, railways, and shipping departments need to work together. For another example, to solve the problem of some steel plants lacking lifting and loading equipment, on the one hand, the machinery department needs to manufacture quickly, and on the other hand, other departments need to take out the lifting and loading equipment that is not in use temporarily to support them. In short, each department must establish a communist view of cooperation. Only when everyone supports steel production can steel production continue to improve.
    We believe that the millions of heroic sons and daughters on the steel front will actively respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, hold high the banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, further carry out the vigorous movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and complete and overfulfill the production task of 12 million tons of steel ahead of schedule!

    提前完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务！
    “提前完成今年一千二百万吨钢的生产任务！”这是党的八届八中全会后，全国成百万钢铁工人响应党的伟大号召的壮志豪语。鞍山钢铁公司全体职工已经在8月28日向全国钢铁企业发出战表，他们保证提前十天完成全年的钢产计划，提前十七天完成全年的钢材生产计划，同时相应地超额和提前完成生铁、矿石、焦炭、耐火材料等生产任务，并且保证完成质量、品种和成本等项指标。上海的钢铁工人提出要超额七万吨至十五万吨完成全年钢的生产计划。北京、天津、重庆、太原等地的钢铁工人也纷纷表示决心，一定要提前完成今年的生产计划。我国钢铁工人给自己选择的奋斗目标，已经不是按期完成今年一千二百万吨钢的生产任务，而是提前和超额完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务！这个伟大的奋斗目标，正鼓舞着钢铁战线上成百万英雄儿女英勇奋发，苦战巧战，一个钢铁生产的新高潮已经来到。八届八中全会的公报和决议发表后，几天来，钢铁产量迅速增长。8月31日，全国钢产量比8月上旬平均日产量增长了23.8％，比8月中旬平均日产量增长了10.3％。这一天生铁的产量也比8月上旬平均日产量增长了26.9％，比8月中旬平均日产量增长了17.8％。这是钢铁生产战线上一个很大的跳跃，它有力地说明党的伟大号召已经成为巨大的物质力量。现在，从目前的情况看来，只要继续巩固和进一步发展已达到的成就，提前完成和超额完成今年生产一千二百万吨钢的任务是肯定能够实现的。
    当然，提前完成和超额完成今年生产一千二百万吨钢的任务，并不是一件轻而易举的事情。我们知道，第一个五年计划期间我国钢的产量总共增加了四百万吨（从1952年的一百三十五万吨到1957年的五百三十五万吨），平均每年净增八十万吨，平均每年增长的速度是31.7％。这个速度曾经震惊了资本主义世界。而今年我国的钢产量要在去年八百万吨洋钢的基础上再增长四百万吨，用一年的时间增加不久以前用五年的时间才能增加的产量。建国以来，我国钢铁工业的历史上有过两次突出的高速度。一次是出现社会主义改造和社会主义建设高潮的1956年，这一年的钢产量净增一百六十一万二千吨。一次就是大跃进的1958年，这一年的钢产量（不包括土钢）净增二百六十五万吨。而今年我国的钢产量将净增四百万吨，要攀登比前两个更高的高峰。立志要提前实现这个伟大的奋斗目标，又一次显示我国钢铁工人在党的领导下，鼓足干劲、力争上游的英雄气概。
    为了提前完成和超额完成今年生产一千二百万吨钢的计划，当前最重要的事情，是反右倾、鼓干劲，把以高产、优质、低成本为中心的增产节约运动深入开展下去。各地事实证明：凡是原来在少数干部中有右倾思想的企业部门，生产总是毫无起色，甚至向后倒退，及至批判了右倾思想，鼓足了干劲，情况就大大改观。为什么8月末钢铁的产量能够比8月初有极大的增长呢？最主要的原因就是党的八届八中全会的精神武装了人们的思想，发挥了成百万钢铁工人的生产积极性和创造性。因此，只要我们坚持反右倾，鼓干劲，坚持以高产、优质、低成本为中心的增产节约的群众运动，就完全可能把钢铁的日产量进一步提高，从而大大地提前完成和超额完成今年一千二百万吨钢的生产任务以及生铁和钢材的生产任务。
    在深入开展以高产、优质、低成本为中心的增产节约的群众运动中，大力解决原料问题，是一个最主要的关键环节。炼钢的原料主要是生铁。要生产更多质量更好的钢，必须要有更多质量更好的生铁。而要生产更多质量更好的生铁，必须要有更多质量更好的焦炭和矿石。目前焦炭和矿石的供应还是不够充裕的。这就需要各个炼铁单位，特别是小高炉炼铁单位，大力节省焦炭，和大力提高矿石的产量和质量，降低炉料消耗，提高炉料质量。还必须抓紧洗煤炼焦和改善矿石的处理。无数的经验证明，用洗过的煤炼焦，提高焦炭的质量，降低焦炭的灰分和硫分，就可以大大减少焦炭的消耗，并且可以大大提高生铁的产量和质量。进行选矿，把粉矿作成烧结矿，把矿石破碎到适当粒度，也可以降低矿石消耗、提高生铁的产量和质量。这些工作做得越好，钢的增产就越有保证。当然，这并不是说，炼钢单位就不要节约生铁了。节约生铁仍然是炼钢企业的一个重要任务，事实上炼钢单位节约生铁的潜力也是很大的。例如，先进的单位炼一吨转炉钢平均消耗生铁一千二百多公斤，一般的单位却要一千五百公斤以上，少数消耗最多的单位竟要二千多公斤。如果一般的单位都达到先进单位的水平，在今后几个月里就可以节约极大数量的生铁。
    提高钢铁生产和轧钢生产的技术水平，同样不可忽视。大炼钢铁的群众运动蓬蓬勃勃开展的一年多来，无论在矿山，大、中、小高炉、平炉、转炉、电炉以及轧钢生产方面，都出现了许多行之有效的先进经验，例如大高炉的提高冶炼强度同时降低焦比的经验，小高炉的先进经验，炼钢的多装快炼、加强炉体维护的经验，轧钢的多条快轧的经验等等。先进的单位运用这些经验使自己的生产远远走在前面，为其他单位指出了前进的道路。7月份，鞍山钢铁公司第二炼钢厂十号大平炉的利用系数已经达到一一点四八吨，而一般大平炉的利用系数是七点八二吨；上海钢铁公司三厂小平炉利用系数已经达到一三点二三吨，而一般小平炉的利用系数是七点六二吨；上海钢铁公司三厂转炉利用系数已经达到二零点一零吨，而一般转炉的利用系数是七吨。在炼铁方面，上半年，本溪第一炼铁厂大中型高炉最高月平均利用系数达到二点四三六吨，而一般大中型高炉的利用系数是一点五六二吨；江苏省小高炉最高月平均利用系数达到零点九五六吨，而一般小高炉的利用系数是零点七吨。如果各个单位都认真推广先进经验，赶上先进水平，钢铁生产必能进一步大大提高，这是提前完成和超额完成一千二百万吨钢绝不可忽视的重要措施。
    加强辅助部门和薄弱环节的工作，也是提高钢铁生产的一个重要环节。例如，厂内运输就是一个很突出的薄弱环节；有些钢厂由于缺乏出渣、出钢的起重装卸设备，生产能力不能充分发挥。此外，一些需要补充部件、零件的新设备尽快地补全，一些在今年内担负生产任务的基本建设工程尽快地投入生产，也是增加钢铁生产的一个重要方面，必须抓紧进行。
    提前和超额完成一千二百万吨钢的生产计划，是一个全民的任务，需要各个部门大力支援。例如，前面说到原料问题是钢铁生产最主要的关键环节。但是原料问题并不只是一个增产节约问题，同样重要的还有一个调运问题。有些地方焦煤和生铁的产量都不少，但是由于没有及时外调；运输有时候也不够及时，这就给一些不产生铁的重点炼钢企业和一些缺煤的省份造成了困难。为了保证完成焦煤和生铁的调运任务，保证高炉不缺煤、钢厂不缺铁，就需要各个省和煤炭部门、铁路、航运部门共同努力。又例如，要解决一些炼钢厂缺乏起重装卸设备的问题，一方面需要机械部门赶快制造，一方面需要其它部门把暂时不用的起重装卸设备拿出来支援。总之，各个部门必须树立共产主义协作观点。只有大家都来支援钢铁生产，钢铁生产才能不断地提高。
    我们相信：钢铁战线上的成百万的英雄儿女，一定积极响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，更高地举起总路线和大跃进的旗帜，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，提前完成和超额完成一千二百万吨钢的生产任务！
