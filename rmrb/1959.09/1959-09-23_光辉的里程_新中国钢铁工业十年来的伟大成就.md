Glorious Milestone
——The Great Achievements of China's Steel Industry in the Last Decade
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Feng Jian

Ten years ago, the flames of war had just ceased on the land of our motherland. The Chinese people rescued the already pitifully small and ravaged steel industry from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, some people sneered behind their backs, coldly mocking, "The Chinese Communist Party is making steel? That's like a plow and an old ox." In Anshan Iron and Steel, those Japanese who were repatriated by the Chinese people also said with ulterior motives: "You might as well plant sorghum in the steel mill! You want to restore Anshan Iron and Steel in less than twenty years? Ha! Dream on!" All imperialists and those hostile to the Chinese people cursed us, predicting that we would surely fail.

Ten years have passed in the blink of an eye. Today, history has drawn a merciless conclusion: The development speed of New China's steel industry is not "a plow and an old ox," not slow, but on the contrary, it is a great leap forward, a high speed, a galloping steed.

1949-1959, what a glorious decade! In the long river of history, ten years is only a very brief moment, but China's steel industry has completed a long journey. This is a journey from rugged paths to broad avenues, from small and weak to strong and healthy, a journey soaring towards the peaks of technology.

                Found a Broad Avenue
When the salutes at Tiananmen solemnly announced the official birth of the People's Republic of China, our country's annual steel output was only 158,000 tons, lagging behind twenty-four countries. At that time, many factories stopped the roar of their whistles. In the furnace shells of the blast furnaces, instead of molten iron, there were either frozen lumps of iron ore or nests for crows, sparrows, and rabbits.

In Anshan Iron and Steel, due to the destructive damage by Japanese imperialists and seven consecutive robberies by the Kuomintang bandits, the entire enterprise was paralyzed in deathly silence. The smoke above the furnaces disappeared, there wasn't a single complete machine, and the pipes were just piles of scrap iron, collapsing in the weeds. It was on this ruined wasteland that the production and construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, according to the call of the Party, immediately began the arduous task of restoration and construction with their own diligent hands. At that time, there was a lack of materials, equipment, and technology. Numerous difficulties stood in the way of progress. However, they said heroically: "The Red Army even crossed the snow-capped mountains and grasslands. We steelworkers will never bow our heads to any difficulties!" After ten years of arduous and tenacious labor, with the strong support of "talent coming from all directions" and "materials being sent from all corners of the country," and with the help of Soviet experts hand-in-hand, they newly built, renovated, and expanded forty-five key projects, turning Anshan Iron and Steel into the first powerful iron and steel complex in the motherland, one of the best in the world. The output in 1958 increased 36.8 times for iron, 49.6 times for steel, and 43 times for steel products compared to 1949, the first year of resumed production. In 1949, the iron and steel products shipped by Anshan Iron and Steel across the country only filled more than 2,000 train carriages; while last year, an average of more than 500 carriages of products were shipped to all corners of the country every day.

The restoration and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel is the epitome of the restoration and construction of New China's steel industry. This is how our steel industry took its first step from the ruins. After completing the three years of the recovery period on a bumpy road, we had 1.35 million tons of steel, reaching the 18th position in world steel production; we successfully completed the First Five-Year Plan, and steel production reached 5.35 million tons, ranking ninth; in the great leap forward of 1958, steel jumped to 8 million tons (3.08 million tons of indigenous steel suitable for rural use, not yet included), surpassing Italy and ranking seventh in the world. This year, we are striving forward on the seventh-place track, and steel production will reach 12 million tons. The great Chinese people are taking giant strides to complete the journey of the originally planned Second Five-Year Plan in just two years, last year and this year.

In just ten short years, our country's steel output will increase from 158,000 tons to 12 million tons. This speed is unimaginable for capitalist countries. It took Britain sixty-seven years (1869-1936) from the Victorian era to complete this journey, including fourteen years of setbacks, with steel production lower than the previous year; Japan from the end of the Meiji era in 1910 until the Eisaku Satō administration in 1958, steel production only increased from more than 160,000 tons to 12.12 million tons, including eight years of setbacks; in the United States, this journey also took twenty-nine years (1872-1901), including seven years of setbacks.

Let's not even talk about the three years of the recovery period. Even if we start from 1953 when our country began implementing the First Five-Year Plan, to 1959, the average growth rate of our country's steel output reached 36.6%. In capitalist countries, the average growth rate of steel production during this period was 3% in Britain, 9.6% in Japan, and decreased by 8.6% in the United States.

We have gained time, and we have gained an inspiring speed of development. But, for us, what is more important and precious is that we have found a broad avenue for high-speed development of the steel industry. This is the general line and a series of socialist construction guidelines proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

In 1958, inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction and the battle call of doubling steel production that resounded from the Beidaihe seashore, the whole nation was mobilized, and tens of millions of people enthusiastically threw themselves into the fiery mass movement of large-scale steelmaking. At that time, the mountains that had been sleeping for many years were awakened, echoing with the sounds of people digging coal and mining! In front of thousands of small furnaces, the fire was blazing, and the flames illuminated the sky! That unprecedentedly magnificent scene is still vivid in my mind, exciting and inspiring.

It was relying on these thousands upon thousands of small blast furnaces and small steelmaking furnaces using indigenous methods, foreign methods, and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, that several million tons of steel and several million tons of pig iron were produced last year. They were sent to steel mills and made into simple machine tools, farm tools, tools, and daily necessities, powerfully supporting many economic sectors. These small ironmaking furnaces and small steelmaking furnaces, together with the "foreign method" produced large ironmaking furnaces and large steelmaking furnaces, made great contributions to the steel production of 1958 and to the future development of the steel industry.

It was on the basis of these thousands upon thousands of small ironmaking furnaces and small steelmaking furnaces that the work of rational site selection, equipment addition, and technology improvement was carried out last winter and this spring. In less than a year, thousands of small blast furnaces and converters armed with mechanical equipment were established. Recalling the beginning of the mass steelmaking movement in the autumn of last year, many places across the country did not have refractory materials and coke. However, people in various regions overcame this difficulty, used low-quality refractory mud and refractory bricks to build thousands upon thousands of indigenous blast furnaces, and used low-quality coal to refine a large amount of indigenous iron. People used these indigenous iron to make a large number of hot blast pipes, cooling equipment, and other simple machines, which in turn equipped the indigenous blast furnaces, gradually moving towards mechanization. At the same time, various regions selected areas close to iron ore and coal resources and with relatively convenient transportation to carry out site selection for iron and steel production bases. In this way, from "indigenous" to "foreign," from small to large, from popularization to improvement, we are constantly moving forward. Up to now, the volume of small blast furnaces put into production nationwide has reached 43,000 cubic meters; the capacity of small and medium-sized converters put into production has reached about 1,400 tons. Small blast furnaces and converters, these two new forces in the steel industry, are shining brightly on the road of continued leap forward in the steel industry this year, together with large-scale iron and steel enterprises.

            Vigorous Youth
The far-reaching impact of the high-speed development of the steel industry on the national economy lies in the fact that the unreasonable layout of the old Chinese steel industry and the incomplete limbs of the steel industry itself have been fundamentally changed.

As everyone knows, the old Chinese steel industry followed a path of humiliation. Greedy imperialists stretched out their bloody hands almost from the early years of our country's modern steel industry.

In the fifth year since the establishment of Hanyeping Iron and Steel Works, China's first modern iron and steel complex, which was also in 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty, enabled Japanese imperialists to plunder our country's resources unscrupulously. From then on, imperialist robbers from Japan, Germany, Britain, and the United States rushed into our country's rich mines. They stole large quantities of iron ore from our country at low prices every year, and then dumped large quantities of steel into our market. According to historical data, in 1936, before the Anti-Japanese War, 86% of the iron ore produced in our country was stolen by imperialists, and the Northeast region occupied by Japanese imperialists at that time was not included. Today, at the port of Huangshi City in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, there is still a mineral unloading machine used by Japanese imperialists to plunder the Daye Iron Mine back then. The past events are still vivid in our minds, and anyone who has seen this huge machine will evoke memories of hatred.

Because of this, the old Chinese steel industry was underdeveloped and scarred by the exploitation and extortion of imperialism:

In order to facilitate imperialist plundering, the steel plants in old China, after fifty-nine years of operation, were mostly built along the coast; the vast and rich inland was a blank space.

In order to facilitate imperialist plundering, the limbs of the steel industry were deformed. It had the ability to smelt iron but not the ability to refine it into steel, and the ability to refine steel but not the ability to roll it into steel products. The output of iron ore, most of which was controlled by the clutches of imperialism, was several times greater than the ironmaking capacity.

In the furnaces of the smelting furnaces in Northeast and North China, refractory bricks from Japan and Germany were laid, and the refractory bricks used in the steel mills in Shanghai and Tianjin also came from Britain and the United States across the ocean.

Now, all of this has become a thing of the past. As a result of the nationwide mass steelmaking campaign, a brand-new picture of the motherland's steel industry has been unfolded before the people of the whole country. The smoke-filled Anshan iron and steel production base, the emerging Wuhan Iron and Steel in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the Baotou Iron and Steel on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia stand like three legs of a tripod. Shanghai, which only produced a few thousand tons of steel a year before liberation, has now developed into a powerful base. In Shijingshan, Taiyuan, Ma'anshan, Chongqing..., construction scaffolding is densely packed, and large-scale iron and steel enterprises are being expanded and newly built in full swing. In the vast majority of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, medium and small-sized iron and steel enterprises are also being built. Two years ago, in addition to a few well-known metallurgical centers, small blast furnaces and small converters were still rare in most areas. Eleven provinces and autonomous regions in the country could not produce a ton of steel, and five provinces could not produce a ton of iron. Today, thousands of small and medium-sized blast furnaces and small and medium-sized converters have formed numerous iron and steel production bases, blooming like flowers all over the country. An iron and steel industrial network interwoven by large and medium-sized, centrally managed and locally managed iron and steel enterprises has been unfolded on the land of the motherland. In just one short year, many of the original blank spots in the steel industry have become home to flowing iron and blooming steel flowers. Who wouldn't be delighted and encouraged by this!

While the steel industry is developing, it is also filling in the gaps and making up for the deficiencies. The historically unbalanced situation between ironmaking and steelmaking capacity has been basically changed; the production capacity of rolling mills is also rapidly improving, gradually adapting to steelmaking capacity.

The deformed state has changed. The steel industry of New China is growing healthily in an era full of sunshine. It has crossed the tragic and humiliating childhood and is striding forward towards a vigorous youth.

              Soaring to the Peaks of Technology
Our steelworkers, with the tenacious will of mountaineers, are climbing the peaks of metallurgical technology. With the brotherly assistance of the great Soviet Union, they continue to achieve victories.

In our factories, the world's first-class large-scale equipment is installed. Like what the workers call "steel giants," large blast furnaces with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters, large open-hearth furnaces with a capacity of 500 tons, and large rolling mills with a roll diameter of 1,150 mm. There are already batches of workers who can skillfully operate these behemoths. Just a few years ago, most of them were just assistants, apprentices, or farmers.

By 1958, each cubic meter of volume in China's large and medium-sized blast furnaces could produce 1.49 tons of pig iron in one day and night, more than double that of ten years ago; each square meter of the bottom of the open-hearth furnace could produce 7.78 tons of steel in one day and night, more than triple that of ten years ago. Among its counterparts in the world, the utilization coefficient of China's steel equipment is undoubtedly among the best.

The Party's call to break superstition and liberate thinking, like a spring breeze, has blossomed into a myriad of colorful flowers of technical innovation in the steel industry park. The wisdom of tens of millions of steelworkers has burst forth like a spring. Whether in ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, or in refractory materials and mining, major creations and technological achievements have emerged. Take ironmaking as an example. Some technicians once believed that the smelting intensity of blast furnaces (the tons of coke burned per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night) could only reach one, and could not be increased any further. If it was increased any further, the furnace would form nodules and waste more coke. However, the employees of the No. 1 Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company overturned this outdated theory with brilliant practical achievements. After experiments, they found a new operating method that not only increased the smelting intensity to 1.5, which no one had ever dared to reach before, but also increased the monthly average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace to the world's advanced level of more than 2.4. Moreover, the proportion of coke consumed per ton of pig iron was also reduced. The steelmakers of the No. 3 Open-Hearth Furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, with their indomitable spirit, pioneered the successful three-tap steelmaking process, and leaped forward to increase the output of the open-hearth furnace with the new method of loading more and smelting faster. The production of magnesia-alumina bricks for building open-hearth furnace roofs is also an important innovation in China's metallurgical industry. In the past, magnesia-chrome bricks were used to build open-hearth furnace roofs in our country, but the raw material for this refractory brick—chromite—depended on imports, and the supply was difficult, which could not meet the needs of the rapid development of steel production in our country. Researchers from the Central Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel and Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, after arduous research, used China's abundant high-alumina bauxite and magnesite resources in 1956 to make high-quality magnesia-alumina bricks. Now this kind of magnesia-alumina brick has been produced in large quantities and successfully applied to open-hearth furnaces, with very good results, and can completely replace magnesia-chrome bricks.

The days when we relied on imports even for foreign iron sheets and foreign nails are gone forever. Our country can now produce more than 500 kinds of high-quality steel, alloy steel, and more than 6,000 kinds of steel products. An alloy steel system of our own, suitable for the characteristics of our country's resources, is also being built from scratch.

From the dozens of tons of machine shafts on ten-thousand-ton ocean freighters to the alloy steel wires thinner than hair in precision instruments, we can produce most of the thousands of types of steel products needed by the national economy every day.

In Anshan, Shanghai, Chongqing..., steelworkers present new steel product varieties to the motherland every year, changing the economic face of the motherland with new technological achievements. On the Yingxia Railway and the Jier Railway, the Lanxin Railway, and the Baocheng Railway, which pass through high mountains and valleys and reach the Xiamen seawall, are laid steel rails produced by ourselves. In the tall factory buildings of Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, and Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant, on the Wuhan Bridge, which spans the Yangtze River, on the Sanmenxia Dam, which cuts off the turbulent currents of the Yellow River, and on countless construction sites across the country, structural steel and structural steel produced by ourselves are used. We use our own seamless steel pipes to manufacture drilling machines, oil pipelines, boilers, and locomotives. Ships and automobiles made with our own steel plates are galloping on the motherland's oceans, rivers, and highways. The motors made with our own silicon steel sheets emit powerful currents, illuminating the cities and villages of the motherland.

Seven years ago, steelmaking workers at Benxi Iron and Steel Company, with the help of Soviet experts, produced the first furnace of stainless steel. The workers cheered and cast a pair of foot-long keys with this furnace of steel water, deeply meaningfully engraving Chairman Mao's quotations on them: "Without industry, there would be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Today, excitedly reviewing the glorious journey of the steel industry over the past ten years, I once again think of those silver keys, with infinite respect for the hardworking and intelligent steelworkers. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have used this key—as a symbol of the motherland's industry and steel industry—to open the door to the high-speed development of the national economy. In the future, it will also open the door to prosperity and strength, and the door to communism for us.

    光辉的里程
    ——新中国钢铁工业十年来的伟大成就
  　新华社记者　冯健
    十年前，战争的烽火在祖国大地上刚刚停熄，中国人民从国民党反动统治者手里，救出了原来就小得可怜、而又被蹂躏得残破不堪的钢铁工业。那时候，有人背地里哼着鼻子，冷冷地嘲笑说：“中国共产党搞钢铁，那是步犁加老牛。”在鞍钢，那些被中国人民遣返的日本人，也别有用心地说：“你们在炼钢厂种高粱吧！没有二十年，想恢复鞍钢？哼，梦想！”一切帝国主义者和敌视中国人民的人，都在诅咒我们，预言我们一定要失败。
    十年转眼过去了。今天，历史作出了无情的结论：新中国钢铁工业的发展速度，不是“步犁加老牛”，不是慢吞吞的，恰恰相反，是大跃进，是高速度，是一匹奔腾如飞的骏马。
    1949—1959，这是多么光辉的十年！在历史的长河里，十年只不过是非常短暂的一瞬间，而我国的钢铁工业，却走完了一段长远的里程。这是从崎岖小路走上康庄大道的里程，是从幼小、孱弱到茁壮、健康的里程，是向技术的高峰飞翔的里程。
                找到了康庄大道
    当天安门的礼炮庄严宣告中华人民共和国正式诞生的时候，我国当年的钢产量只有十五万八千吨，落在二十四个国家的后面。那时候，许多工厂停止了汽笛的喧叫，高炉炉壳里，不是冻结着铁矿石的瘤子，就是成了乌鸦、麻雀、野兔子的窝。
    在鞍钢，由于日本帝国主义者毁灭性的破坏和国民党匪帮一连七次抢劫，整个企业瘫痪在死一般的沉寂中。熔炉上空的烟雾消失了，没有一架完整的机器，管道成了一堆堆废铁，倒塌在蒿草丛中。就在这个残破的废墟上，鞍钢的生产建设者，根据党的号召，立即用自己勤劳的双手，开始了艰巨的恢复和建设工作。那时候，缺乏器材、设备，缺乏技术，重重困难横亘在前进的路上。但是，他们豪迈地说：“红军连雪山、草地都过了，我们钢铁工人决不向任何困难低头！”经过十年艰苦顽强的劳动，他们在全国“东西南北来人材，四面八方送物资”的大力支援下，在苏联专家手把着手的帮助下，新建、改建和扩建了四十五项重点工程，把鞍钢建设成了祖国第一个强大的、在全世界也是屈指可数的钢铁联合企业。1958年的产量，比恢复生产的第一年——1949年，铁增加了三六点八倍，钢增加了四九点六倍，钢材增加了四十三倍。1949年鞍钢运送全国的钢铁产品，只不过装了二千多个火车车皮；而去年，平均每天就有五百多个车皮的产品运送到全国各个角落。
    鞍钢的恢复、建设，是新中国钢铁工业恢复、建设的缩影。我国钢铁工业就是这样，从废墟上迈开了第一步。在崎岖不平的路上，走完了恢复时期的三年，才有了一百三十五万吨钢，赶到了世界钢产量的第十八位；胜利实现了第一个五年计划，钢产量达到了五百三十五万吨，是第九位了；大跃进的1958年，钢跳到了八百万吨（适合农村使用的土钢三百零八万吨，尚未包括在内），超过了意大利而居于世界第七位。今年，我们在第七名的跑道上奋勇前进，钢产量将达到一千二百万吨。伟大的中国人民正以巨人的步伐，要在去年和今年两年时间内，走完原来拟定的第二个五年计划的里程。
    短短十年，我国钢产量从十五万八千吨将增加到一千二百万吨，这种速度是资本主义国家不敢设想的。英国从维多利亚女王时代起，用了六十七年（1869—1936）才走完这段路程，其中有十四年开了倒车，钢产量低于前一年；日本从明治末年的1910年一直到岸信介执政的1958年，钢产量才从十六万多吨达到一千二百一十二万吨，其中有八年开了倒车；美国，这段路程也跑了二十九年（1872—1901），其中有七年开了倒车。
    且不说恢复时期的三年吧。即使从1953年我国开始执行第一个五年计划算起，到1959年，我国钢产量的平均增长速度也达到了36.6％。而资本主义国家，在这一段时间里钢产量的平均增长速度，英国是3％，日本是9.6％，美国下降了8.6％。
    我们赢得了时间，赢得了令人振奋的发展速度。但是，对我们来说，更重要、更宝贵的东西是，我们已经找到了一条高速度发展钢铁工业的康庄大道。这就是党中央和毛主席所提出的总路线和一系列的社会主义建设的方针。
    1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线和从北戴河海滨响起的钢产量翻一番的战斗号角的鼓舞下，全民动员起来了，几千万人热情奔放地投入了如火如荼的大炼钢铁的群众运动。那时候，多少年来沉睡着的高山峻岭被唤醒了，震荡着人们挖煤、采矿的爆破声！成千上万座小熔炉前，火光熊熊，烈焰烛天！那一幅空前壮丽的盛景，至今仍然历历在目，激动人心。
    就是依靠这成千上万座土法、洋法、土洋结合的小高炉和小炼钢炉，去年生产了几百万吨钢和几百万吨生铁，它们被送进炼钢厂和制成了简易机床、农具、工具和生活用具，有力地支援了许多经济部门。这些小炼铁炉、小炼钢炉，和“洋法”生产的大炼铁炉、大炼钢炉一道，在1958年的钢铁生产中，和对今后钢铁工业的发展，立下了丰功伟绩。
    就是在这成千上万座小炼铁炉和小炼钢炉的基础上，去冬今春进行了合理定点、增加设备和提高技术的工作，在不到一年的时间里，建立起了几千座由机械设备武装起来的小高炉和转炉。回忆去年秋天大办钢铁运动之初，全国许多地方没有耐火材料和焦炭，但是各地人民克服了这个困难，用低质的耐火泥和耐火砖，修成了成千上万座土高炉，使用低质煤炼出了大量土铁。人们用这些土铁制成大量热风管、冷却设备和其他简单机械，又反过来装备了土高炉，逐渐走上机械化的道路。同时，各地选择了靠近铁矿、煤矿资源和交通比较方便的地区，进行了钢铁生产基点的定点工作。就是这样，从“土”到“洋”，从小到大，从普及到提高，不断地向前迈进。到现在，全国已经投入生产的小高炉，容积达到了四万三千立方米；已经投入生产的中小型转炉，容量达到了一千四百吨左右。小高炉、转炉，这两支钢铁工业的新军，今年又和大型钢铁企业一道，在钢铁工业继续跃进的道路上大放光彩。
            生气勃勃的青春时代
    钢铁工业的高速度发展，带给国民经济更为深远的影响还在于：旧中国钢铁工业不合理的布局和钢铁工业本身残缺不全的肢体，从根本上改变了。
    大家知道，旧中国的钢铁工业，走着一条屈辱的道路。贪婪的帝国主义者，几乎是从我国近代钢铁工业刚刚诞生的那些年代，就伸出了血腥的手。
    我国第一个现代钢铁联合企业——汉冶萍钢铁厂开始创办的第五年，也就是1895年，丧权辱国的马关条约，使日本帝国主义得以肆无忌惮地掠夺我国的资源。从那时以后，日本、德国、英国、美国等帝国主义强盗，争先恐后地闯进了我国富饶的矿山。他们年年用低贱的价格从我国抢走大批铁矿石，然后再把大量钢材，抛进我国市场倾销。据历史资料，抗日战争前夕的1936年，我国生产的铁矿石，有86％被帝国主义者抢走了，而日本帝国主义当时占领的东北区还未包括在内。今天，长江中游黄石市的港口上，还残留着一架日本帝国主义当年掠夺大冶铁矿时用的卸矿机。往事历历，凡是见过这部巨大机器的人，都会唤起阵阵仇恨的记忆。
    正因为这样，旧中国的钢铁工业发育不全，满身带着帝国主义盘剥、榨取的鞭痕：
    为了便于帝国主义掠夺，旧中国办了五十九年钢铁，钢铁厂大都建立在沿海一线；辽阔富饶的内地，却是一片空白。
    为了便于帝国主义掠夺，钢铁工业的肢体是畸形的，炼出了铁没有能力炼成钢，炼出了钢没有能力轧成钢材。而大部分被帝国主义魔爪控制的铁矿石的产量，却比炼铁能力要大好几倍。
    在东北、华北冶炼炉的炉膛里，砌着日本、德国的耐火砖，上海、天津炼钢厂用的耐火砖，也是来自远隔重洋的英国、美国。
    现在，这一切都成为历史的陈迹了。全民大炼钢铁的结果，一幅崭新的祖国钢铁工业图景，已经展现在全国人民面前。烟雾弥漫的鞍山钢铁生产基地和新兴的长江中游的武钢，内蒙古草原上的包钢鼎足而立。解放前仅仅年产几千吨钢的上海市，今天已经发展成为强大的基地。在石景山、太原、马鞍山、重庆……，建筑脚手架密密层层，大型钢铁企业正在紧张地扩建和新建。在全国绝大多数的省、市、自治区里，也都在建设自己的中、小型钢铁企业。两年以前，除了几个知名的冶金中心外，在广大地区，小高炉、小转炉还是寥寥无几，全国有十一个省、自治区不能生产一吨钢，五个省不能生产一吨铁。今天，数千座中小高炉、中小转炉已经形成了许许多多钢铁生产基点，像花朵一样在全国各地绽开。一个由大型的和中小型的，中央管理的和地方管理的钢铁企业交织起来的钢铁工业网，已经在祖国大地上张开了。时间仅仅是短短的一年，许许多多原来的钢铁工业空白点，变成了铁水长流、钢花怒放之乡，谁能不为之欢欣鼓舞！
    钢铁工业一面发展，一面在填平补齐。历史上炼铁、炼钢能力不平衡的状况，已经基本上改观了；轧钢厂的生产能力也正在迅速提高，和炼钢能力逐步相适应。
    畸形状态改变了。新中国的钢铁工业，在充满阳光的时代里健康地成长起来。它跨过了悲惨屈辱的幼年时代，朝向生气勃勃的青春时代昂首阔步前进了。
              向技术高峰飞翔
    我国钢铁工人，怀着登山运动员那样坚韧顽强的意志，攀登冶金技术的高峰。在伟大的苏联兄弟般地援助下，他们不断地取得胜利。
    在我们的工厂里，安装着全世界第一流的大型设备。像工人们称作“钢铁巨人”的，容积为一千五百一十三立方米的大高炉，五百吨的大平炉，轧辊直径为一千一百五十毫米的大轧钢机。已经有成批的工人，能够娴熟地驾驭这些庞然大物。而几年前，他们大多数人还只是助手、学徒工、农民。
    到1958年，我国大中型高炉每一个立方米的容积，一昼夜就能生产一点四九吨生铁，比十年前提高了一倍多；每一个平方米的平炉炉底，一昼夜就能生产七点七八吨钢，比十年前提高了二倍多。在世界同行当中，我国钢铁设备的利用系数，毫无愧色地名列前茅。
    党的破除迷信、解放思想的号召，像春风一样，吹开了钢铁工业园内万紫千红的技术革新花朵。千万名钢铁工人的智慧，泉涌般地迸发出来了。无论在炼铁、炼钢、轧钢方面，或是耐火材料、采矿方面，都涌现出了重大的创造和技术成就。就拿炼铁来说吧。曾经有一些技术人员认为，高炉的冶炼强度（每一立方米高炉容积每昼夜燃烧焦炭的吨数）只能达到一，不能再提高了，再提高，炉子就会结瘤，多费焦炭。但是，本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂的职工，用光辉的实践成果，推翻了这个陈旧的理论。他们经过试验，寻求到一种新的操作方法，既把冶炼强度提高到了从来没有人敢于达到过的一点五，又把高炉的月平均利用系数提高到了二点四以上的世界先进水平。而且，每吨生铁消耗焦炭的比例也降低了。太原钢铁公司三号平炉的炼钢手们，用不屈不挠的精神，首创三槽出钢成功，用多装快炼的新方法跳跃式地提高了平炉产量。砌筑平炉炉顶用的镁铝砖的制成，也是我国冶金工业一项重要的创举。过去我国砌筑平炉炉顶，都是用镁铬砖，但是，这种耐火砖的原料——铬铁矿要依赖进口，供应困难，不能满足我国炼钢生产飞速发展的需要。鞍钢中央试验室和重庆钢铁公司的研究人员，经过艰苦的钻研，在1956年利用我国丰富的高铝土和菱镁矿资源，制成了质量很高的镁铝砖。现在这种镁铝砖已经大量生产，成功地应用在平炉上，效果好得很，完全可以代替镁铬砖了。
    历史上连洋铁皮、洋钉都依赖进口的日子，已经一去不复返了。我国已能生产五百多种优质钢、合金钢和六千多种钢材。适合我国资源特点的、我国自己的合金钢系统，也正在从一无所有的空地上建立起来。
    从万吨海轮上那几十吨重的机轴到精密仪表里比头发还要细的合金钢丝，国民经济每天需要的千百种钢材，绝大部分我们自己可以生产了。
    在鞍山、上海、重庆……，钢铁工人们每年把新的钢材品种献给祖国，用新的技术成就改变着祖国的经济面貌。在穿过高山峡谷直达厦门海堤的鹰厦路和集二路，兰新路、宝成路上，铺的是我们自己生产的钢轨。在长春第一汽车厂、太原重型机器厂和兰州热电厂那些高大的厂房里，在横跨长江天堑的武汉大桥上，在拦腰截断了黄河滚滚激流的三门峡拦河坝上，以及全国无数的建筑工地上，用的是我们自己生产的型钢和结构钢。我们用自己的无缝钢管，制造了钻探机、输油管、锅炉、火车头。用自己的钢板制造的轮船、汽车，在祖国的海洋、河流、公路上奔驰。用自己的矽钢片制成的电机，发出了强大的电流，照亮了祖国的城市和农村。
    七年前，本溪钢铁公司的炼钢工人，在苏联专家帮助下，炼出了第一炉不锈钢。工人们欢呼着，含意深长地用这一炉钢水铸成了一双一尺多长的钥匙，上面刻着毛主席的语录：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”今天，兴奋地回顾钢铁工业十年来光辉的里程，我再一次想起那双银光闪闪的钥匙，怀着对勤劳、智慧的钢铁工人无限的敬意。过去几年，我们在党和毛主席的领导下，用这把钥匙——它作为祖国工业和钢铁工业的象征——打开了高速度发展国民经济的大门，今后，它还将为我们打开通向繁荣富强的大门，共产主义的大门。
