Title: The Mouth of a Right-Wing Opportunist

The mouth of a right-wing opportunist is like a cracked drum.
	It cannot emit the call to battle, the resounding paean, the inspiring "boom, boom" sound.
	What it emits is chaotic noise, an inarticulate sigh, the weeping of failure, and the deflated, despairing moan.

	＊

	People say: A right-winger is an ominous crow, because he is good at making such weeping predictions.
	When marching towards the enemy, he predicts "mistakes";
	When fighting the enemy, he predicts "failure";
	When achieving victory and summarizing experience, he predicts "shortcomings! shortcomings! shortcomings!"

	＊

	Thinking a leaf will break his head; thinking a tender blade of grass will snap his feet. . .
	This is the common ailment of right-wingers.

	＊

	Although there are few right-leaning people, they all have "illnesses,"
	Either "neurosis" or "megalomania."
	Because, in their eyes, a rabbit is seen as a tiger, and a fox is recognized as a fierce lion.
	If, on their way, they even encounter a small stone, they will turn around and run, shouting in alarm:
	"Whoa! A big mountain is blocking the way ahead, we can't get through!"

	＊

	If "difficulty" also becomes a "victor," then its only opponent will be the right-winger. And its only captive will also be the right-winger.

### 右倾主义者的嘴

    右倾主义者的嘴
      田雨　陈宵
    右倾主义的嘴，就像一支裂了缝的鼓。
    它发不出那战斗的号召，那雄浑的高歌，那振奋人心的“咚咚”之声。
    它发出的，是混乱的噪音，喑痖的哀叹，失败的哭泣，以及泄气的，绝望的悲鸣。
                                            ＊
    人们说：右倾者是一只不祥的乌鸦。因为他善于作这样的哭泣的预言。
    在向敌人进军之时，他就预言“错误”；
    在和敌人搏斗之时，他就预言“失败”；
    在取得胜利，总结经验之时，他就预言“缺点！缺点！缺点！”
                                              ＊
    以为一片树叶，会打破他的脑袋；以为一株嫩草，将碰断他的双足。……
    这是右倾者的通病。
                                                  ＊
    右倾的人，虽然很少，却都有“病”，
    不是“神经质”，就是“夸大狂”。
    因为，在他们的眼里，兔子被看成老虎，狐狸被认作猛狮。
    如果，在他们的路上，即或碰着一块小小的石头，他也会掉头便跑，大惊大吼：
    “吙！前面一座大山挡道，过不去！”
                                      ＊
    假如“困难”也变成“胜利者”，那么，它的唯一的对手，就将是右倾者。而它唯一的俘虏，也将是右倾者。
