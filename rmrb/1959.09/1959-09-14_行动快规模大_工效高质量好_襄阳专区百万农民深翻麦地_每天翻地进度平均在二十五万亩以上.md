Fast Action, Large Scale, High Efficiency, Good Quality
Xiangyang Special District's Million Farmers Deeply Plough Wheat Fields
Averaging Over 250,000 Mu of Land Ploughed Daily

(Our dispatch) Xiangyang Special District, a major wheat-producing area in Hubei Province, has mobilized one million laborers to vigorously engage in deep ploughing of wheat fields. By September 4th, 2.5 million mu of land had been deeply ploughed, with a daily progress of over 250,000 mu.

According to the special district's plan, the winter sowing area this year will increase from 10 million mu last year to 12 million mu. The total summer harvest yield next year will also increase from 2 billion jin this year to approximately 3 billion to 3.5 billion jin. There are many specific measures to achieve this great leap forward plan, and the most important are: first, to reclaim wasteland on a large scale to expand the winter sowing area; second, to deeply plough the land comprehensively to improve the soil and increase its fertility. The district plans to reclaim 1.5 million to 2 million mu of wasteland this year, and over 300,000 mu have already been reclaimed. Of the district's 12 million mu of winter sowing area, except for 4 million mu that are not suitable for deep ploughing due to late previous crops, steep slopes, and thin soil layers, the remaining 8 million mu are planned for deep ploughing; dry land will be deeply ploughed to a depth of 8 cun or more, and paddy fields to a depth of about 6 cun.

The characteristics of this year's deep ploughing campaign in Xiangyang Special District are: fast action, large scale, high efficiency, and good quality. The reason is that all localities have thoroughly implemented the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions to "oppose rightism and boost morale," broken various right-leaning conservative ideas and fear of difficulties and wavering emotions, and launched a mass campaign to vigorously engage in deep ploughing. There are many favorable conditions for deep ploughing this year. The people's communes have become more consolidated; there is the experience and ideological foundation from deep ploughing last year; and there are many early-season fields, allowing for early action. However, on the issue of deep ploughing, there is still a struggle between advanced thinking and right-leaning conservative thinking. Those with right-leaning conservative thinking emphasize that "plains can be deeply ploughed, but hilly areas cannot." A few leading cadres also lacked a firm and active attitude in the face of this argument. For example, some only plan to plough a part of the land, not all of it; some do not seize the opportunity to engage in deep ploughing, but believe that it is still early and there is no need to rush; and some do not advocate doing it all at once, but advocate shallow ploughing first and then deep ploughing. Therefore, all localities are using rectification as the guiding principle to boost the energy for deep ploughing, break various right-leaning conservative ideas, and vigorously launch mass movements. Experience has proven that in areas where the leadership is determined, confident, and grasps early, tightly, and ruthlessly, all difficulties are solved, and the movement is in full swing. The deep ploughing movement in Zaoyang County is a good example. As of September 4th, 330,000 mu of the county's 450,000 mu of early-season fields had been deeply ploughed. After visiting Zaoyang's deep ploughing efforts, the Xiangyang County Party Committee and commune Party committee secretaries launched a large-scale campaign throughout the county the next day, and are now catching up with Zaoyang. In Guanghua County, over 210,000 mu of the 250,000 mu of fallow land have been deeply ploughed, accounting for 84%. Currently, the average daily participation in deep ploughing in the entire special district is over one million laborers, and the daily progress of deep ploughing averages over 250,000 mu.

From this movement, it can be seen that in addition to seizing the opposition to rightism as a driving force, all localities have also done the following: First, large-scale mobilization, large-scale concentration, and large-scale breakthroughs. This means concentrating leadership, concentrating labor, and concentrating cattle and farm implements. All localities, based on their own conditions, while ensuring that current autumn field management and autumn harvest preparation work are done well, concentrate manpower and animal power as much as possible to do a good job in deep ploughing of wheat fields.

Second, overall planning, assigning leaders to shifts, and dividing into areas for combat. Deep ploughing, drought resistance, autumn harvesting, cotton picking, fertilizer accumulation, threshing, and grain delivery all have special teams and dedicated personnel in charge. In deep ploughing, basically the production team is taken as a war zone, organizing various small teams to cooperate and fight jointly. However, in cooperation, the principle of equal exchange is adhered to.

Third, mobilizing the masses and carrying out high-efficiency movements. In addition to tool reforms, all localities have also focused on holding deep ploughing on-site meetings at all levels to impart and exchange deep ploughing techniques, improve efficiency, and ensure quality. At the same time, a labor quota system was widely implemented, that is, the "five-determination" contracting system of setting tasks, setting labor, setting work points, setting time, and setting rewards and punishments. Deep ploughing headquarters at all levels grasped typical examples, established red flags, organized large-scale inspections and evaluations, and carried out in-depth competition movements between communes, teams, and groups.

Fourth, mobilizing the vast number of cadres to engage in experimental fields on a large scale. The district plans to have 1 million to 2 million mu of experimental fields. This year, Zaoyang County has put forward several specific requirements for experimental fields: first, start from the beginning—that is, start from deep ploughing; second, start from bad land—go where it is difficult; third, do it yourself—everyone who engages in experimental fields must do it themselves. The county already has 18,000 cadres who have personally cultivated 30,000 mu of deep ploughing model fields.

Fifth, in order to ensure the balanced development of the movement, all areas that should be deeply ploughed, whether hilly or river areas, plains or mountainous areas, near or far areas, must be deeply ploughed. Zaoyang County proposed: achieve consistency between distant and near lands, consistency between good and bad lands, and ensure the timely completion of deep ploughing. Xiangyang County proposed: not a single piece missed, not a single inch left, piece-by-piece acceptance, and comprehensive balance. Now, the scale of the movement in the entire district is getting larger and larger, the efficiency is getting higher and higher, and the quality is getting better and better.

    行动快规模大　工效高质量好
    襄阳专区百万农民深翻麦地
    每天翻地进度平均在二十五万亩以上
    本报讯　湖北省主要产麦区——襄阳专区，集中一百万劳动大军，大搞麦地深翻工作。到9月4日，已深翻地二百五十万亩，每天进度在二十五万亩以上。
    按照这个专区的计划，今年的冬播面积将由去年的一千万亩增加到一千二百万亩；明年的夏收总产量也将由今年的二十亿斤，增加为三十亿斤到三十五亿斤左右。实现这个跃进规划的具体措施很多，而其中最主要的：一是大量开垦荒地，扩大冬播面积；二是全面深翻土地，改良土壤，增长地力。全区计划今年开荒一百五十万亩到两百万亩，现已开出三十多万亩。全区一千二百万亩的冬播面积中，除了有四百万亩因为前茬晚、田地坡度大、土层薄，不适合深翻以外，其余八百万亩计划全部深翻；旱地深翻八寸以上，水田深度六寸左右。
    襄阳专区今年大闹深翻运动的特点是：行动快，规模大，工效高，质量好。原因是各地深入贯彻了党中央“反右倾、鼓干劲”的指示的精神，打破了各种右倾保守思想和畏难动摇情绪，掀起群众性大闹深翻的运动高潮。今年深翻地的有利条件是很多的。人民公社更加巩固了；有去年深翻的经验和思想基础；早茬地多，可以早动手。但是，在深翻问题上，仍然有先进思想和右倾保守思想的斗争。有右倾保守思想的人，他们强调什么“平原能深耕，岗地不能深耕”。也有少数领导干部，在这种论调面前，态度不够坚定和积极。比如，有人只打算翻一部分地，不打算全部翻；有人不是抓紧时机搞深翻，而是认为时间尚早，无需着急；也有人不主张一气呵成，而是主张先浅后深。因此，各地都举整风之纲，鼓深翻之劲，打破各种各样的右倾保守思想，大搞群众运动。经验证明，凡是领导决心大，信心强，抓得早，抓得紧，抓得狠的地区，一切困难迎刃而解，运动热火朝天。枣阳县的深翻运动，就是一个很好的例证，全县四十五万亩早茬地，截止9月4日，已有三十三万亩进行了深翻。襄阳县委和公社党委书记，在参观了枣阳的深翻以后，第二天就在全县范围内大干起来了，现在正在追赶枣阳。光化县二十五万亩腾茬地，已经深翻二十一万多亩，占84％。现在全专区每天平均参加深翻的劳动力在一百万人以上，每天深翻地的进度平均在二十五万亩以上。
    从这段运动来看，各地除抓住以反右倾为动力以外，还作到以下几点：首先是大动员，大集中，大突击。这就是领导集中，劳动力集中，耕牛、农具集中。各地都根据自己的条件，在保证做好当前秋田管理和秋收准备工作的同时，尽可能地集中人力和畜力，做好麦地深翻。
    其次，全面安排，分班领导，分片作战。深耕、抗旱、秋收、拣花、积肥、打场、送粮等，样样都有专门班子，专人负责。在深耕上，基本上是以生产队为一个战区，组织各小队协作，联合作战。但在协作时，又坚持了等价交换的原则。
    第三，发动群众，开展高工效运动。除了工具改革以外，各地还抓住了层层召开深翻现场会，传授和交流深翻技术，提高工效，保证质量。同时，广泛实行了劳动定额制，即定任务、定劳力、定工分、定时间、定奖惩的“五定”包工。各级深翻指挥部则抓典型、树红旗，组织大检查、大评比，深入开展公社与公社、队与队、组与组的竞赛运动。
    第四，发动广大干部大搞试验田。全区计划搞试验田一百万亩到两百万亩。今年枣阳县对试验田提出了几项具体要求：一是从头搞起——就是从深耕就开始搞；二是从坏地搞起——那里艰巨到那里搞；三是亲自动手搞——凡是搞试验田的人，都要亲自动手。这个县已经有一万八千名干部，亲自动手搞了三万亩深耕样版田。
    第五，为了保证运动平衡发展，不论岗地或河地、平原或山区、近地或远地，凡是应该深翻的，块块都要深翻。枣阳县提出：作到远地近地一致，好地坏地一致，保证按时完成深翻。襄阳县提出：一块不漏，一寸不让，块块验收，全面平衡。现在，全区运动的规模越来越大，工效越来越高，质量越来越好。
