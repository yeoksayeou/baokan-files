Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th—Communist Youth League member Wang Bingxiang, a lathe operator at the Shanghai Xingzhong Electric Motor Factory, has carried out three consecutive innovations, increasing the production efficiency of screws nearly a thousandfold.

This type of screw is one of the main parts of the "AC contactor" produced by the Xingzhong Factory. According to the factory's production tasks, 1.8 million pieces are needed annually. Even if all 13 lathes in the factory were used to process screws, the annual production would still fall far short of meeting production needs. Communist Youth League member Wang Bingxiang was determined to create a thread rolling machine to process screws instead of lathes. He flipped through many technical theory books, looking for various reference materials, and after 21 failures, he finally succeeded in creating it with the leadership of the Party branch and the help of technical personnel and veteran workers. The thread rolling machine was successfully trial-produced, increasing production efficiency by 30 times. However, Wang Bingxiang was not satisfied. Two months later, he carried out a second innovation on the original basis, adding an automatic unloading device to the thread rolling machine, making the production efficiency 200 times higher than the initial level.

After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, he began a third innovation on this machine. With the help of veteran workers, he solved the problem of automatic feeding. As a result, it used to take four minutes to machine one screw at the beginning of the year, but now it has been shortened to one minute to machine 250 screws. The production efficiency has increased nearly a thousandfold compared to the initial level. Now, with just one thread rolling machine, the entire screw processing task can be completed in less than five days.

Advanced producer, lathe operator Sun Maosong of Harbin No. 1 Machinery Factory completed 54 months of work last year. From January to September 5th this year, he completed 50 months of work. He is currently stepping into 1968 at a speed of working six days in one day. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Qi)

    连闯三道技术关完成工具改革
    王秉祥提高工效近千倍
    据新华社上海18日电　共青团员、上海兴中电机厂车工王秉祥连续进行三次革新，把加工螺丝的生产效率提高了近千倍。
    这种螺丝是兴中厂生产的“交流接触器”上的主要零件之一。按照这个厂的生产任务，全年需用一百八十万只；即使把全厂十三部车床都用来加工螺丝，全年生产的螺丝也远不能满足生产的需要。共青团员王秉祥决心要制造一部加工螺丝的滚丝机来代替车床。他翻了许多有关的技术理论书，寻找各种参考资料，先后经过二十一次失败，终于在党支部的领导下，得到技术人员和老工人的帮助，创造成功。滚丝机试制成功了，生产效率提高了三十倍。但是王秉祥并不满足。两个月以后，他又在原有基础上搞第二次革新。在滚丝机上增添了自动落料装置。使生产效率比最初提高了二百倍。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议，公布后，他又在这部机器上开始了第三次的革新。在老工人的帮助下，他解决了自动进料的问题。这样一来，年初车一只螺丝要花四分钟，现在缩短到一分钟就能车二百五十只，生产效率比最初猛增近一千倍。现在，只要一台滚丝机，在不到五天的时间里，就能完成全部的螺丝加工任务。
    先进生产者、哈尔滨第一机械厂车工孙茂松去年一年完成了五十四个月的工作量，今年1月到9月5日，又完成了50个月的工作量。目前他正以一天干六天活的速度跨进了1968年。　新华社记者　冯琦摄
