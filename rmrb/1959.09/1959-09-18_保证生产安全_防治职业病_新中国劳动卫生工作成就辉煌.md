Guaranteeing Production Safety and Preventing Occupational Diseases
Brilliant Achievements in New China's Occupational Health Work
The National Occupational Health and Occupational Disease Academic Conference called on occupational health workers and occupational disease research workers to summon greater drive, overcome right-leaning sentiments, consolidate and improve existing achievements, and ensure that health work keeps up with the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production.
    This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Medical Association recently held the National Occupational Health and Occupational Disease Academic Conference in Dalian. The conference reviewed the achievements of China's occupational health, occupational disease prevention and control, and scientific research work over the past decade; clarified the direction and methods of occupational health, occupational disease scientific research, and prevention and control work in the future; and, on the basis of extensive exchange and summary of experiences, drafted ten plans related to heatstroke prevention and cooling, dust prevention, and occupational poisoning prevention and treatment.
    The information provided at the conference shows that in the ten years since the founding of New China, under the leadership of the Party and through the efforts of the broad masses of workers, medical workers, and many experts, China's occupational health work has achieved rapid development, and the unsafe and unhygienic labor conditions left over from the old society have been fundamentally changed. In terms of heatstroke prevention and cooling, due to the active implementation of the state's regulations that "cooling measures should be taken when the temperature of indoor workplaces is regularly higher than 35 degrees," a set of relatively effective methods has been accumulated in industries such as textiles, machinery manufacturing, large and medium-sized iron and steel smelting, glass, and enamel. For example, textile factories have adopted low-temperature air supply, evaporative cooling air supply, roof sprinkling, shade shelters, motor air ducts, and heat-insulating exhaust hoods, which have generally reduced the workshop temperature by two to four degrees Celsius in summer, and some factories have even reduced it by five or six degrees Celsius; in terms of preventing silica dust, the state requires that the concentration of silica dust in workshops or workplaces of factories and mines should be reduced to two milligrams per cubic meter. In order to meet the national standard requirements, factories and mining enterprises across the country launched mass technical innovation movements for dust prevention, organized large-scale cooperation in preventing silica dust, and many scientific researchers went deep into the mines, summarized mass experience, and combined it with on-site conditions to formulate comprehensive measures such as wet operations, strengthening ventilation, sealing, dust absorption, cleaning, personal protection, and regular health checks, which have achieved great results. In particular, in the metallurgical system, the concentration of free silica in the air at mining operation sites has basically reached the national standard. In the coal mine system, the silica dust in most mines has also reached the national standard. In recent years, the incidence of silicosis in factories and mining enterprises in various places has decreased significantly. In the prevention and treatment of more complex occupational poisoning, many investigations and prevention and treatment research work have also been carried out. Relatively in-depth research has been conducted on lead, mercury, and benzene poisoning, which pose a greater and more common threat to the health of workers. In the printing industry, due to a series of measures such as sealing, ventilation, exhaust, strengthening workers' personal hygiene, and establishing a clean and hygienic system, the lead dust concentration in most workplaces has reached hygienic standards.
    This conference received more than 400 academic papers related to occupational health and occupational diseases, many of which have certain scientific and practical significance and aroused the interest of the participants. Everyone believes that it is the crystallization of the hard work of the broad masses of workers and scientific research workers in China over the past few years. In accordance with the scientific spirit of letting a hundred flowers bloom and seeking truth from facts, the conference conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the academic papers and some practical problems presented at the conference. On this basis, plans for cooling, dust prevention, and occupational poisoning prevention and treatment were drafted. These plans follow the principle of prevention first, combining prevention and treatment, and provide systematic and specific measures from prevention to treatment. They are a valuable resource for widely carrying out occupational health and academic research activities. These plans will be used as a reference for various places, and will be continuously supplemented and improved through re-practice.
    The conference analyzed the situation of the continuous leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, and called on occupational health workers to overcome right-leaning sentiments, summon greater drive, and ensure that their work keeps up with the needs of the rapid development of production. The conference determined that the specific tasks in the future are: to continue to summarize and promote the advanced experiences of the broad masses and at home and abroad, and to consolidate and improve the achievements that have been made. Dust prevention and heatstroke prevention work should create more methods based on different regions and conditions, and should not only study technical improvements, but also study organizational measures. The prevention and treatment of occupational poisoning should prioritize the most harmful and most common cases in industrial and agricultural production, requiring that acute poisoning be controlled as soon as possible, chronic poisoning be prevented, and factories and mining enterprises with the conditions should actively take anti-poison measures to ensure that the concentration of toxic gases in the workplace meets hygiene requirements. The representatives enthusiastically discussed the scientific research work on occupational health and occupational diseases. They believed that research work must be carried out under the leadership of the Party, serve national economic construction, serve the health of workers, and implement the principle of prevention first. In the arrangement of research projects, it is necessary to combine key and general projects, and to combine current practical problems with long-term theoretical problems. The conference proposed a number of specific research projects. In order to coordinate the national research forces, implement division of labor and cooperation, and eliminate duplication and omissions of topics, it was decided to form a committee composed of relevant parties with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Institute of Occupational Diseases as the core to be responsible for coordinating research topics, plan implementation, supervision and guidance of research work, and organizing academic exchanges and information exchanges. In order to ensure that occupational health and occupational disease prevention and research work can be carried out well, the conference emphasized that under the leadership of the Party, it is necessary to combine scientific technology with mass movements, and in accordance with the principle of overall planning, coordination, and cooperation, mobilize the relevant forces of Chinese and Western medicine and industrial and agricultural production departments, and use both foreign and indigenous methods to solve the most urgent practical problems and far-reaching theoretical problems. The conference cited a large number of examples to prove that the broad masses of workers, safety engineering technicians in factories and mines, and health personnel in grassroots medical institutions have rich experience in heatstroke prevention and cooling, dust prevention, and occupational poisoning prevention and treatment, which need to be discovered, summarized, improved, and promoted by scientific health workers.
    The conference lasted for ten days, from the opening on August 12 to the closing on August 22. Zhang Jiafu, Deputy Director of the Second Office of the State Council, spoke at the conference. Qian Xinzhong, Deputy Minister of Health, gave a concluding speech at the conference.
    A total of 257 representatives attended the conference. Including the directors of health bureaus in major provinces and cities across the country, well-known experts, professors, and Chinese and Western doctors, as well as health engineering personnel. (Attached pictures)

    保证生产安全　防治职业病
    新中国劳动卫生工作成就辉煌
    全国劳动卫生和职业病学术会议号召劳动卫生工作者和防治职业病研究工作者，要鼓足更大干劲，克服右倾情绪，巩固提高已有的成就，使卫生工作跟上生产大跃进的需要。
    本报讯　卫生部和中华医学会最近在旅大市召开了全国劳动卫生和职业病学术会议。会议检阅了十年来我国劳动卫生、职业病防治和科学研究工作的成就；讨论明确了今后劳动卫生、职业病科学研究和防治工作的方向和方法；在广泛交流总结经验的基础上，草拟了有关防暑降温、防尘和防治职业中毒等十个方案。
    会议提供的情况表明：新中国建国十年来，在党的领导下，经过广大职工群众、医务工作者和许多专家的努力，我国劳动卫生工作获得了飞跃发展，旧社会遗留的不安全不卫生的劳动条件，已经根本改变。防暑降温方面，由于积极执行了国家对“室内工作地点的温度经常高于三十五度的时候，应该采取降温措施”的规定，在纺织、机械制造、大中型钢铁冶炼和玻璃、搪瓷等行业中，都积累了一套比较有效的办法。例如，纺织业各厂分别采用了低温送风、蒸发冷却送风、屋顶喷水、搭凉棚、马达风道以及隔热排气罩等措施，夏季车间温度普遍降低了二到四度，有些厂甚至降低了五、六度（摄氏）；防止矽尘方面，国家要求厂矿企业的车间或工作地点的矽尘浓度，每立方米应该降低到二毫克。为了达到国家要求的标准，全国有关厂矿开展群众性防尘技术革新运动，组织了防止矽尘的大协作，许多科学工作人员深入矿井，总结群众经验结合现场条件，制定了湿式作业，加强通风、密闭、吸尘、清扫、个人防护、定期健康检查等综合性措施，收到了很大效果。特别是冶金系统，矿山作业场所空气中的游离二氧化矽已经基本上达到国家规定的浓度标准。在煤矿系统中，多数矿的矽尘也达到了国家规定的浓度标准。几年来，各地厂矿企业中的矽尘患病率有显著下降。在防治比较复杂的职业中毒方面，也作了许多情况调查和防治研究工作。对危害职工健康较大较普遍的铅、汞、苯中毒，进行了比较深入的研究，在印刷业中，由于采取了密闭、通风、排气和加强工人个人卫生，建立清洁卫生制度等一系列措施，铅尘浓度在大部分作业场所达到了卫生标准。
    这次会议，收到了四百多篇有关劳动卫生和职业病等的学术性论文，其中许多论文具有一定的科学意义和实际意义，引起了与会者的兴趣。大家认为，它是几年来我国广大职工群众和科学研究工作者辛勤劳动的结晶。会议根据百家争鸣和实事求是的科学精神，对提到大会上的学术论文和若干实际问题，展开了广泛、深入的讨论。在这个基础上，草拟了降温、防尘和防治职业中毒等方案。这些方案遵照预防为主、预防和治疗相结合的方针，从预防到治疗都提供了系统而具体的措施，是一部广泛开展劳动卫生和学术研究活动的宝贵资料。这些方案将供各地参考，通过再实践，不断补充和完善。
    会议分析了全国工农业生产不断跃进的形势，号召劳动卫生工作者，克服右倾情绪，鼓足更大干劲，使自己的工作跟上生产迅速发展的需要。会议确定今后的具体任务是：继续总结推广广大群众和国内外的先进经验，巩固提高已经取得的成就。防尘防暑工作，要根据不同地区和条件，创造更多的办法，既要研究技术改进，也要研究组织措施。职业中毒的防治要把工农业生产中危害最大、最普遍的列为首位，要求尽快控制急性中毒，预防慢性中毒，有条件的厂矿企业，应当积极采取防毒措施，使工作场所有毒气体的浓度，合乎卫生要求。代表们热烈讨论了劳动卫生及职业病的科学研究工作。认为研究工作必须在党的领导下，为国民经济建设、为工人健康服务，贯彻执行预防为主的方针。在研究项目的安排上，要实行重点和一般相结合，目前实际问题和长远理论问题相结合。会议提出了一批具体研究项目，为了统筹安排全国研究力量，实行分工协作，消除课题重复和遗漏现象，决定以医学科学院和职业研究所为核心，由有关方面组成委员会，负责协调研究题目、计划落实、督促指导研究工作，组织学术交流和情报交流。为了让劳动卫生及职业病防治研究工作很好开展起来，会议强调在党的领导下，实行科学技术和群众运动相结合，按照统筹安排、配合协作的原则，调动起中、西医及工、农业生产部门的有关力量，洋土并举，解决当前最迫切的实际问题和影响深远的理论问题。会议举出了大量事例，证明广大职工群众、厂矿的安全工程技术人员、基层医疗机构的卫生人员等，都有防暑降温、防尘、防治职业中毒的丰富经验，有待科学卫生工作者去发现、总结和提高，并加以推广。
    会议举行了十天，从8月12日开幕到22日闭幕。国务院第二办公室副主任张稼夫在会上讲了话。卫生部副部长钱信忠作了大会总结发言。
    参加这次会议的代表，共二百五十七人。包括有全国主要省市的卫生厅、局长，著名的专家、教授和中、西医师以及卫生工程人员。（附图片）
