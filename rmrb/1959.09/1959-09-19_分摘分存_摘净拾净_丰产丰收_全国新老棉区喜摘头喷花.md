The new and old cotton-growing areas across the country are delighted to pick the first flush of cotton.

The new cotton harvested in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces has generally increased production compared to the bumper harvest of the first flush cotton last year, and the quality has also surpassed any previous year. The new cotton from many people's communes is white in color, has few impurities, and long fibers. The grade is generally one or two grades higher than in previous years, and one hundred catties of seed cotton can produce two to three catties more lint.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th - The new and old cotton-producing areas across the country have generally begun harvesting new cotton. At present, whether it is the cotton-producing areas in the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin, or the cotton-producing areas in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, or the cotton-producing areas in the Northeast and Northwest, the first flush of cotton has successively matured and bloomed. The commune members in various places are beaming with joy, picking the fruits of the harvest happily in the cotton fields that are like a sea of silver flowers, striving to pick and harvest one batch at a time, picking clean and storing every fiber, achieving a bumper harvest.

As soon as the new cotton began to be harvested, the good news of the harvest came like snowflakes from various cotton-producing areas. The new cotton harvested in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other provinces generally increased production compared to the bumper harvest of the first flush cotton last year, and the quality also exceeded any previous year. The new cotton harvested from many people's communes in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei and other provinces is white in color, has few impurities, and the grade is generally one to two grades higher than in previous years. One hundred catties of seed cotton can produce two to three catties more lint than last year, and the fiber length reaches thirty-four to thirty-five millimeters, which is about five millimeters longer than last year. Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, which planted more than 150,000 mu of cotton this year, has thick and strong stalks, many and large bolls, and abundant flowers and fruits. Wang Liancheng, a member of the people's commune in this county, said excitedly when picking new cotton: I have been growing cotton for so many years, and the cotton has never been as good as this year. The good harvest of the first flush cotton is the victory of this year's cotton field management in grasping the middle bolls and fighting drought. It once again illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune.

This year, cotton matured and bloomed generally earlier than in previous years. Cotton-growing areas in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu and other provinces began to pick new cotton in mid-August, and subsequently cotton in other cotton-producing areas matured and bloomed successively. At present, the work of picking new cotton has entered a climax in major cotton-producing areas such as Henan, Hebei, and Shandong. Henan Province dispatches 1.6 million cotton pickers every day to pick the blooming silver flowers in the cotton fields. As of the 12th, the province has sold more than 930,000 dan of new cotton, over fulfilling the original sales plan for September. Each cotton-producing area of Hebei Province dispatches a large number of laborers every day to pick flowers, dry flowers, and sell flowers. The Handan area, which planted 5.45 million mu of cotton this year, dispatches more than 500,000 people every day to pick and sell new cotton. Their slogan is: seize sunny days, grab cloudy days, race against time, and work hard for three days to pick the first flush of cotton. In the first two days of September, they picked more than 86 million catties of new cotton and sold more than 20 million catties of new cotton. After two days of hard work, Cixian County, Hebei Province, has universally picked all the cotton fields in the county once.

When picking new cotton, they have accepted the lessons learned from the rough autumn harvest last year, strengthened leadership, reasonably organized labor, and set reasonable labor remuneration for harvesting flowers, so they have generally achieved timely and meticulous picking. In the Handan area of Hebei Province, cadres at all levels from the area and county to the commune and production team have come forward to lead the work of picking and selling cotton. Communes and production teams have generally established professional teams for picking and selling cotton, thus speeding up the progress of picking and selling cotton. The entire area has also universally promoted the double-pocket cotton picking method, separating good and bad cotton into bags, which improved the quality of the cotton. In Linqing City, Shandong Province, after the people's communes organized professional cotton picking teams and implemented the seven-fixed responsibility system of fixed person, fixed plot, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed work points, and fixed rewards and punishments, the progress of picking flowers increased from the original 1.8 million catties per day to 3.5 million catties. Zhao Village Brigade of Chengguan People's Commune and each small team of this brigade in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, have established leadership organizations for separate picking, separate drying, separate storage, and separate sales to guide the work of each new cotton picking team, which greatly improved the quality of the cotton. Sichuan Province stipulates that cotton-producing areas should withdraw 20%-25% of the labor force to pick and sell new cotton.

While happily picking new cotton, the commune members in various cotton-producing areas across the country are also grasping the late-stage management of cotton, striving to grow more autumn bolls, large bolls, and more good flowers, and striving to over fulfill the glorious task of increasing cotton production by 10% proposed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee this year.

    分摘分存　摘净拾净　丰产丰收
    全国新老棉区喜摘头喷花
    冀鲁豫皖江浙等省采摘的新棉普遍比去年大丰收的头喷棉增产，质量也超过以往任何一年。许多人民公社的新棉色泽白、杂质少、棉绒长，品级一般比往年提高一、二级，一百斤籽棉可多出二、三斤皮棉。
    新华社18日讯　全国新老产棉区已普遍开始采摘新棉。目前，不论黄河流域和长江流域的产棉区，还是云贵高原的产棉区，也不论是东北和西北的产棉区，头喷花都已先后成熟吐絮，各地人民公社社员喜气洋洋，在银花似海的棉田里，愉快地采摘丰收的硕果，力争开一批采摘一批，摘净拾净，朵絮归仓，丰产丰收。
    新棉一开摘，丰收的捷报就从各个产棉区像雪片一样地传来。河南、河北、山东、安徽、江苏、浙江和四川等省，采摘的头喷新棉普遍比去年大丰收时的头喷棉增产，而且质量也都超过以往任何一年。河南、河北、山东、湖北等省许多人民公社采摘的新棉色泽白，杂质少，品级一般比往年提高了一级到两级，一百斤籽棉可比去年多出皮棉二斤到三斤，棉绒长度达三十四到三十五毫米，比去年长出五毫米左右。山西省翼城县今年种植的十五万多亩棉花，长得秆粗秆壮，桃多桃大，花盛果繁。这个县的人民公社社员王连成在采摘新棉时兴奋地说：我种了多少年的棉花，那一年也没有今年的棉花好。头喷棉收得好，是今年棉田管理大抓伏桃和抗旱斗争的胜利。它又一次说明人民公社的无比优越性。
    今年各地棉花成熟吐絮一般比往年提早。河南、山东、河北、湖北、江苏等省棉区8月中旬就已开始采摘新棉，随后其他各产棉区的棉花相继成熟吐絮。当前，河南、河北、山东等主要产棉区，采摘新棉的工作已进入高潮。河南省每天出动一百六十万摘棉大军，到棉田里采摘开放的朵朵银花，到12日止，这个省已售出新棉九十三万多担，超额完成了9月份原订的售棉计划。河北省各个产棉的专区，每天都出动大批劳动力，摘花、晒花、售花。今年植棉五百四十五万亩的邯郸专区，每天出动五十多万人采摘新棉、交售新棉，他们提出的口号是：抓晴天，抢阴天，争分夺秒抢时间，大干三天摘完头喷花。在9月一、二两日就采摘新棉八千六百多万斤，交售新棉两千多万斤。河北磁县经过两天奋战，已将全县的棉田普遍摘过一遍。
    在采摘新棉时，接受去年秋收粗糙的教训，加强了领导，合理地组织了劳动力，定出合理的收花劳动报酬，因而一般地都做到了及时地精细采摘。河北邯郸专区从专区、县到公社、生产队的各级干部，都出马领导摘棉、售棉工作，各公社和生产队普遍成立了摘棉、售棉专业队，因而加快了摘棉、售棉进度。全专区还普遍推广了双兜摘棉法，把棉花好坏分摘入袋，提高了棉花的质量。山东临清市各人民公社在组织了摘棉专业队，推行了定人、定地块、定时间、定质量、定数量、定工分、定奖惩的七定责任制后，摘花进度由原来每日一百八十万斤提高到三百五十万斤。山东高唐县城关人民公社赵庄大队和这个大队的各小队，都成立了分摘、分晒、分存、分售的领导组织，来指导各个采摘新棉小组进行工作，大大提高了棉花的质量。四川省规定产棉区抽出20％—25％的劳动力，进行摘、售新棉。
    全国各个产棉区的社员们，一面喜摘新棉，一面大抓棉花后期管理，争取多座秋桃，长大桃和多开好花，争取超额完成党的八中全会提出的今年棉花增产10％的光荣任务。（附图片）
