Since the Great Leap Forward, China's converter steelmaking has developed rapidly. Newly built converters in various regions have been put into production one after another, forming a splendid situation where every province has steel.

In the first half of this year, the output of converter steel increased by 227% compared with the same period last year, and the daily output level of converter steel in July increased by 68% compared with January. After the launch of the anti-Rightist campaign to boost morale, the daily output level of converters has surged even more dramatically. The six-day average at the end of August increased by 69% compared with July. The quality has also improved greatly. In the coming months, converters will produce more than 40% of the total steel output. The task is arduous and glorious.

Due to the shortage of pig iron supply, the equipment capacity of converters has not been fully utilized. Therefore, reducing pig iron consumption in converter steelmaking is an extremely important task at present. This is not only a basic link to further reduce costs, but also a key issue to raise converter steel production to a higher level and ensure the early and overfulfillment of this year's steel output plan; it is the most important task in the current high-yield, high-quality, and low-cost production increase and economy practice.

The recent National Converter Steelmaking Pig Iron Saving Experience Exchange Conference held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Shanghai was timely. If we can reduce the pig iron used per ton of steel ingot by about 2,000 kilograms, then we can save hundreds of thousands of tons of pig iron this year, thereby producing hundreds of thousands of tons more steel.

The potential for saving pig iron is enormous. Since the beginning of this year, the consumption of iron and steel materials per ton of qualified steel ingot in converters has been reduced significantly. According to incomplete statistics, it decreased by about 13% in August compared with the beginning of the year. However, on the whole, it is still relatively high, and the potential for saving is still great. In the past, the consumption of iron and steel materials per ton of steel ingot in Tangshan Steel Plant was as low as 1,165 kilograms. Judging from the achievements of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Qingdao Shengjian Machinery Factory introduced at this conference, the average pig iron consumption is only about 1,300 kilograms. Some factories believe that their own conditions are not good, they use high-sulfur pig iron, the equipment conditions are poor, and the technical strength is weak, so it is difficult to reduce pig iron consumption. However, comparing the indicators of various factories, the pig iron consumption of factories with the same conditions also varies greatly. Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, which uses high-sulfur iron to make steel, has poor equipment conditions, but the pig iron consumption is only 1,260 kilograms, which is much lower than some factories that use foreign iron and have strong technical strength.

Further reducing pig iron consumption is entirely possible. First of all, we must put politics in command, mobilize the masses, and make relevant employees ideologically aware of the importance of saving pig iron, calculate carefully, focus on the big picture, start with the small things, and save pig iron in every possible way, and launch a mass movement to save pig iron. Secondly, we must strengthen organization and management. Converter production can be said to be seven parts organization and three parts technology. We must strengthen organization and management, strengthen personnel allocation, establish a responsibility system, and strengthen the connection and collaboration between relevant departments and various work sections. Establish a shift-based and group-based assessment system for pig iron consumption and conduct evaluations. Again, technical measures must be taken to improve the qualification rate of steel, reduce molten iron loss and blowing loss, reduce casting loss, and eliminate leaking steel and low-temperature defective products. This includes strictly following operating procedures in a series of processes from batching to casting. Units using high-sulfur iron to make steel should also use hot-blast alkaline operation iron-making furnaces. The above measures are necessary to reduce pig iron consumption. The reason why some units such as Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, No. 3 Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Qingdao Shengjian Machinery Factory have lower pig iron consumption is mainly because they have resolutely implemented these measures.

Experience proves that any problem can be solved quickly as long as the leadership insists on putting politics in command, launching a mass movement, and explaining it clearly to the masses, so that relevant employees understand its importance and have direction and measures. The pig iron consumption of converter steelmaking will soon be greatly reduced. All converter workers in the country, arouse soaring enthusiasm, and strive to save pig iron in every possible way to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's steel output plan.

    降低转炉炼钢的生铁消耗
    大跃进以来，我国的转炉炼钢有了飞快的发展。各地新建转炉纷纷投入生产，形成了省省有钢的灿烂局面。
    今年上半年转炉钢的产量比去年同期增长227％，转炉钢的日产水平7月份比1月份增长68％。反右倾鼓干劲的运动开展后，转炉的日产水平更是突飞猛进，8月末六天平均比7月又增长69％。质量也有了很大提高。在今后的几个月中，转炉将要生产占全部钢产量40％以上的钢。任务是艰巨而光荣的。
    由于生铁供不应求，转炉的设备能力还未能充分发挥起来。因此降低转炉炼钢的生铁消耗是当前一项极为重要的任务。这不仅是进一步降低成本的基本环节，而且也是把转炉钢的生产提高到一个更高的水平，保证提前完成和超额完成今年钢产量计划的一个关键问题；是目前高产、优质、低成本的增产节约运动中头等重要的一项工作。
    最近冶金工业部在上海召开了全国转炉炼钢节约生铁经验交流会议是及时的。如果我们能把每吨钢锭所用的生铁降低二千公斤左右，那么，我们在今年内就可节约几十万吨生铁，从而多生产出几十万吨钢。
    节约生铁的潜力是很大的。今年以来转炉每吨合格钢锭的钢铁料消耗曾有不少降低，据不完全统计8月份比年初降低了约13％。但是总的看来一般还是比较高，节约的潜力还是很大的。过去唐山钢厂每吨钢锭钢铁料消耗曾低到一千一百六十五公斤的水平。从这次会议所介绍的上钢六厂、唐山钢厂与青岛市生建机械厂的成绩来看，平均生铁消耗也只一千三百公斤左右。有的厂以为本厂条件不好，用的是高硫生铁，设备条件差，技术力量弱，因而生铁消耗难以降低。但是把各厂的指标进行比较，条件相同的工厂，生铁消耗也是相差悬殊的。用高硫铁炼钢的上钢六厂设备条件差，但生铁消耗也只一千二百六十公斤，比有些用洋铁、技术力量强的工厂消耗要低得多。
    进一步降低生铁消耗是完全可以做到的，首先在于政治挂帅，发动群众，使有关职工在思想上都认识到节约生铁的重要意义，精打细算，大处着眼，小处着手，千方百计节约生铁，开展一个节约生铁的群众性运动。其次，必须加强组织管理，转炉生产可以说是七分组织三分技术，必须加强组织管理，加强人员配备，建立责任制度，加强有关部门和各工段间的联系与协作。建立生铁消耗的分班分组考核制度并进行评比。再次，必须采取技术措施，提高钢的合格率，减少铁水损失及吹炼损失，减少浇铸损失，消灭漏钢与低温废品。包括从配料到浇铸的一系列过程中都要严格按照操作规程办事。用高硫铁炼钢的单位还要采用热风碱性操作化铁炉。上述这些措施是降低生铁消耗所必须采取的措施。上钢六厂、三厂、唐山钢厂、青岛生建机械厂等一些单位，他们之所以生铁消耗较低，主要就在于坚决贯彻了这些措施。
    经验证明，任何问题只要领导上坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，并且向群众讲清楚，有关职工了解到其重要性，有了方向和措施，就会很快得到解决。转炉炼钢的生铁消耗就会很快大大降低下来。全国转炉职工们，鼓起冲天干劲，千方百计节约生铁保证超额完成今年钢产量计划而奋勇前进。
