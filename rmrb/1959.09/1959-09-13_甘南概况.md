Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southern part of Gansu Province, in the center of the great motherland, which is part of what people used to call the Amdo Tibetan area. Within its borders, the Xiaojishi Mountains, Xiqing Mountains, and Min Mountains, branches of the Kunlun Mountains, rise and fall majestically. The Yellow River, Bailong River, Tao River, and Daxia River flow through it. Rainfall is abundant, sunshine is plentiful, grasslands are vast, the soil is fertile, forests are lush, and mineral resources are abundant. The total area is more than 45,000 square kilometers.

The prefecture has a total population of more than 340,000 people, including Tibetan, Han, Hui, Tu, Salar, and Mongolian ethnic groups, of which Tibetan people account for 49%. The autonomous prefecture was established on October 1, 1953. In September of last year, the entire prefecture achieved people's communization. The number of households joining the communes accounted for 90.94% of the total number of households, forming a total of thirty-five people's communes, of which twenty-five were formed by merging the original six hundred and fifty advanced cooperatives. The remaining ten were "leaping to the sky in one step" from the feudal individual economy.

Gannan is the main animal husbandry base in Gansu Province. The grassland area of the entire prefecture accounts for half of the total area. The carrying capacity of all grasslands can reach more than 10 million head of livestock, and the current utilization rate is less than one-fifth. The pastures are lush with water and grass, and the height of the pasture grass is generally between five decimeters and one meter three decimeters. According to tests, it is one of the best pastures in the world. The Yellow River meander area has even more alluvial grasslands of two to three thousand square kilometers. The pasture grass is taller than people, making it a rare high-quality natural pasture in the country. The famous Hequ horse in the country is produced here. Animal husbandry plays an important role in the economic life of the people of the entire prefecture. Its total output value accounts for 42.3% of the total national economic income. Since liberation, animal husbandry production has greatly increased. The number of livestock has increased from one million head in the early days of liberation to more than 1.7 million head now, with an annual output of 2 million catties of wool and more than 200,000 various animal skins.

In Lintan, Longdie and other counties within the state, the climate is mild, irrigation is convenient, and the cultivated land is quite fertile. Two crops are produced annually, and crops such as wheat, highland barley, rice, and cotton are planted. The planting area of the entire state is 1.2 million mu, accounting for only about 20% of the arable land.

Along the Tao River and Bailong River basins, there are dense, towering forests with dense shade, with a total area of more than 540,000 hectares, growing precious timber such as spruce, fir, cypress, oil pine, and birch. The diameter of many timbers is more than two meters, and it is known as one of China's six major "green treasure houses". In addition, Gannan is also rich in wild animals such as musk deer, deer, lynx, otters, and bears, and dozens of precious medicinal materials such as codonopsis, rhubarb, fritillaria, and cordyceps.

    甘南概况
    甘南藏族自治州位于甘肃省南部，处在伟大祖国版图的中心，即过去人们称为安多藏区的一部分。境内昆仑山支脉的小积石山、西倾山和岷山等巍峨起伏，黄河、白龙江、洮河、大夏河纵横奔流，雨量充沛，日照充足，草原辽阔，土地肥沃，森林繁茂，矿藏丰富。全部面积为四万五千多平方公里。
    全州共有藏、汉、回、土、撒拉、蒙古等民族三十四万多人，其中藏族人民占49％。自治州成立于1953年10月1日。去年9月全州实现了人民公社化，入社户数占总户数的90.94％，共组成三十五个人民公社，其中有二十五个是由原来的六百五十多个高级合作社合并建成的。其余十个是由封建个体经济“一步登天”的。
    甘南是甘肃省的主要畜牧业基地。全州草原面积占总面积的一半，全部草原的载畜量可达一千万头以上，目前利用率还不到五分之一。牧场水草丰美，牧草高度一般在五公寸到一米三公寸之间，据化验为世界上最好的牧草之一。黄河河曲一带更有冲积成的两三千平方公里的大草原，牧草高过于人，为全国少有的优良天然牧场，著名全国的河曲马即产于此。畜牧业在全州人民经济生活中起着重要作用。它的总产值占国民经济总收入的42.3％。解放后畜牧生产有很大增长，牲畜数量已由解放初期的一百万头，增至现在的一百七十多万头，年产羊毛二百万斤，各种兽皮二十余万张。
    州内临潭、龙叠等县，气候温和，灌溉便利，耕地相当肥沃，年产两作，种植着小麦、青稞、水稻、棉花等农作物。全州播种面积一百二十万亩，只占可耕地20％左右。
    沿洮河、白龙江流域，绵延着茂密参天、浓阴蔽空的林海，总面积有五十四万多公顷，生长着云杉、冷杉、圆柏、油松、桦等珍贵木材，不少林材的直径达两米以上，被誉为我国六大“绿色宝库”之一。此外，甘南还盛产麝、鹿、猞猁、水獭、熊等野生动物，和党参、大黄、贝母、虫草等数十种珍贵药材。
