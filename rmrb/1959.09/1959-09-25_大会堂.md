Great Hall of the People
Guo Moruo
The Great Hall of the People will be completed in October, a unique achievement to be praised for thousands of years.
The spirit of the nation is vast, its accomplishment unprecedented, its literary magnificence boundless, its joy without end.
The spirit of labor shines like the sun and moon, the people's will transforms heaven and earth.
The greatest glory belongs to the Party, which leads all others with discipline and principles.

    大会堂
    郭沫若十月完成大会堂，千秋独步颂声扬。国风浩浩功无古，文采泱泱乐未央。劳动精神昭日月，人民意气革玄黄。最高光烈归于党，领导群伦有纪纲。
            一九五九年九月十四日
