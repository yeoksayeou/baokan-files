Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 11th: According to reports here, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, announced on the evening of the 10th that the Vietnamese people resolutely oppose the illegal resolution of the United Nations Security Council to establish a subcommittee to "investigate" the situation in Laos.

Ton Duc Thang made these remarks at the celebration of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. Present at the celebration were Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, member of the Central Committee, members of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, and representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations.

Ton Duc Thang emphasized that we strongly condemn the US imperialist policy of aggression in Laos, which blatantly violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos and attempts to turn Laos into a US military base.

Ton Duc Thang said that if the war provocations of US imperialism and its running dogs are not stopped in time, the civil war in Laos will expand and prolong, seriously threatening peace and security in Southeast Asia and the world.

On the same day, the Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace also issued a statement on the United Nations Security Council's decision to establish a subcommittee to "investigate" the situation in Laos, demanding that the International Commission for Laos immediately resume its activities to safeguard peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 11th: A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam made a statement to reporters today, strongly refuting the Lao authorities' continued slanders against Vietnam.

The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that the BBC reported on September 10 that the Lao authorities recently issued a communique stating that "some communists crossed the border forty kilometers and attacked the Muong Khoua stronghold." The spokesperson said that on the same day, Saigon Radio reported that Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat said, "The Lao Minister of Defense confirmed that the Viet Cong provided important assistance to the rebels. If Laos requests assistance from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Thailand is ready to send troops to Laos at any time."

The spokesperson pointed out that the information in the Lao authorities' aforementioned communique is completely fabricated. The spokesperson said that it is regrettable that official figures like Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat are issuing statements based on fabricated information from the Royal Lao Government. However, it is not surprising that the Thai Prime Minister is making such statements, as he is doing so to echo the Lao government's slanderous arguments. His purpose is to realize the conspiracy of US imperialism, which is to hasten the direct intervention of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc in Laos.

    呼吁制止美国在老挝的侵略政策
    越南外交部发言人再次驳斥老挝当局对越南的诬蔑
    据新华社河内11日电　据这里报纸报道：越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜10日晚上宣布，越南人民坚决反对联合国安全理事会关于成立“调查”老挝局势的小组委员会的非法决议。
    孙德胜是在越南祖国战线成立四周年庆祝会上讲这一番话的。参加庆祝会的，有越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征，中央委员阮春水，祖国战线中央委员会委员，各民主党派、人民团体的代表等。
    孙德胜强调说，我们激烈谴责美帝国主义在老挝的侵略政策，它明目张胆地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议，妄图把老挝变为美国的军事基地。
    孙德胜说，如果不及时制止美帝国主义和它的走狗的战争挑衅行动，老挝的内战将会扩大和延长，将会严重威胁东南亚和世界的和平和安全。
    同一天，越南保卫世界和平委员会也就联合国安全理事会决定成立小组委员会“调查”老挝局势这件事发表声明，要求老挝国际委员会立即恢复活动，以维护印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。
    据新华社河内11日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人今天对记者发表谈话，严厉驳斥了老挝当局最近继续对越南进行的诬蔑。
    外交部发言人说，英国广播公司在9月10日报道，老挝当局最近发表公报说：“一些共产党分子越过了边界四十公里，向芒科据点进攻”。发言人说，同一天西贡电台报道，泰国政府总理乃沙立说，“老挝国防大臣确认了越共给叛乱分子以重要的援助。如果老挝向东南亚条约组织提出要求的话，泰国随时都准备向老挝派遣军队”。
    发言人指出，老挝当局上述公报中的消息完全是捏造的。发言人说，令人遗憾的是，像泰国政府总理乃沙立这样的官方人士，却根据老挝王国政府捏造的消息来发表声明。不过，泰国总理发表这种声明也不足为奇，因为他是为附和老挝政府的诬蔑论调而发表的。他的目的在于实现美帝国主义的阴谋，即加紧唆使东南亚侵略集团早日直接干涉老挝。
