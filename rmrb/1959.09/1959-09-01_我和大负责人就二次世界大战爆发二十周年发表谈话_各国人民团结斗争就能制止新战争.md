I and a Leading Official Give a Talk on the Twentieth Anniversary of the Outbreak of World War II
United Struggle of People of All Countries Can Stop a New War

(Report from this newspaper) The person in charge of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on September 1, the "Day of Struggle Against the Danger of Another World War." The full text is as follows:

Today is the twentieth anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. The World Peace Council has called on all countries to designate September 1 as the day of struggle against the danger of another world war. The Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace firmly supports this call by the World Peace Council and firmly believes that it will receive widespread support from all peace-loving and war-opposing people in the world.

Since the end of World War II, the desire for peace among people all over the world has been repeatedly obstructed by the war group headed by US imperialism. In particular, US imperialism has consistently adhered to its policies of aggression, expansion, and the Cold War, constantly intensifying international tensions. The United States has not only failed to withdraw its military bases abroad but has continued to expand and strengthen these bases, stepped up the formation of military blocs and preparations for nuclear war, and repeatedly obstructed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the termination of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing.

In the Far East, the United States continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, continues to赖在(rely on) South Korea to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, and further colludes with the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism and building Japan into a nuclear war base. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the United States continues to carry out various conspiracies of interference and subversion everywhere. This policy of aggression, expansion, and war threats by the US warmongering group is being met with increasingly strong opposition from people all over the world.

Recently, the United States has also created tension in Indochina. In order to turn Laos into its military base and gradually drag Laos into the Southeast Asia military bloc, the United States blatantly directed the Lao Sananikone government to tear up the Geneva Accords and expand the civil war they provoked. This behavior by the United States is seriously threatening peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Easing international tensions is the common desire and urgent requirement of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Thanks to the tremendous efforts made by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to safeguard peace and ease international tensions, and thanks to the high tide of the movement for peaceful coexistence and opposition to the Cold War among peace-loving countries and people all over the world, an agreement has recently been reached on mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States.

We welcome the mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, which expresses the Soviet Union's willingness to take the initiative to ease international tensions and actively strive for world peace. Now the broad masses of people and public opinion in the world are waiting to see how sincere the US government is in easing international tensions. We believe that the strength of the people who defeated fascism in World War II, as long as they remain vigilant, strengthen unity, and constantly fight against the US policy of war and aggression, it is possible to save the world from the danger of another world war. The Chinese people will, together with the people of the world, fight to the end to resolutely oppose aggression and defend world peace.

### 我和大负责人就二次世界大战爆发二十周年发表谈话  各国人民团结斗争就能制止新战争

    我和大负责人就二次世界大战爆发二十周年发表谈话
    各国人民团结斗争就能制止新战争
    本报讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人就9月1日“反对另一次世界大战危险的斗争日”发表谈话，全文如下：
    今天是第二次世界大战爆发的二十周年，世界和平理事会号召各国把9月1日定为反对另一次世界大战危险的斗争日。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会坚决支持世界和平理事会的这一号召，并深信它将得到世界各国一切爱好和平反对战争的人民的广泛支持。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，全世界人民要求和平的愿望一直受到以美国帝国主义为首的战争集团的一再阻挠，特别是美帝国主义一直坚持侵略扩张政策和冷战政策，不断地加剧了国际紧张局势。美国不仅没有撤退它在国外的军事基地，反而继续扩大和加强这些基地，加紧拼凑军事集团和准备核战争，并一再阻挠就签订对德和约、结束西柏林的占领制度、禁止核武器试验等问题达成协议。
    在远东地区，美国还继续霸占着我国的领土台湾，继续赖在南朝鲜阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，并进一步勾结日本岸信介政府、加紧复活日本的军国主义，把日本建成核战争基地。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，美国到处继续进行种种干涉和颠覆的阴谋活动。美国好战集团的这种侵略扩张和战争威胁政策，正受到全世界人民愈来愈强烈的反对。
    最近，美国又在印度支那制造紧张局势。为了把老挝变为它的军事基地和逐步把老挝拖入东南亚军事集团，美国明目张胆的指使老挝萨纳尼空政府撕毁日内瓦协议，扩大由他们挑起的内战。美国的这种行为正在严重地威胁着东南亚地区和世界的和平。
    缓和国际局势是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同愿望和迫切要求。由于苏联和其他社会主义国家为维护和平与缓和国际紧张局势所作的巨大努力，由于全世界爱好和平的国家和人民赞成和平共处和反对冷战运动的高涨，最近达成了苏美两国首脑互相访问的协议。
    我们欢迎苏美两国首脑互相访问，它表达了苏联主动地缓和国际紧张局势和积极地争取世界和平的意愿。现在世界广大人民和公众舆论都在等着看美国政府对缓和国际局势究竟有多大诚意。我们相信，曾经在第二次世界大战战胜了法西斯的人民的力量，只要保持警惕，加强团结，对美国的战争侵略政策不断地进行斗争，就有可能使全世界免遭另一次世界大战的危险。中国人民将和全世界人民一起，为坚决反对侵略、保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。
