Dear Comrades:

	I am greatly honored to address you on behalf of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Netherlands at this grand gathering of Communists from around the world.

	We come from the Netherlands to extend our fraternal, militant greetings from the Dutch Communists, and to congratulate you on the tenth anniversary of the founding of your great People's Republic.

	The workers and all progressive people in our country are watching the rapid development of your country with astonishment and great joy.

	Your labor and your achievements are further proof of the infinitely bright future that awaits a nation whose people are united and advancing under the leadership of the Communist Party.

	The residents of our country have fought against floods for hundreds of years, and have reclaimed most of our land from the sea by building dikes. Therefore, we greatly admire your achievements in fighting floods. We understand how difficult it is to tame the raging waves when floods come and rivers surge. We are very pleased to hear that you have built many water conservancy projects to prevent floods. From this, we can also see the enormous difference between a people's government that does everything for the people and a bourgeois government, like ours, that only cares about the interests of big cartels.

	We are also carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects, the so-called Delta Plan. This plan has two objectives: first, to protect the southeast of our country from seawater intrusion forever, and second, to reclaim thousands of hectares of farmland. The rapid implementation of this plan is of national significance, but this project has been delayed for several years because the government is unwilling to provide sufficient funding. This policy is one of the evil consequences of the government's policy of following the aggressive North Atlantic bloc in expanding its arms.

	Not only is the implementation of the Delta Plan paralyzed by this policy, but the huge expenses of arms expansion have also brought to a standstill many works that must be carried out for the benefit of the people, such as the project to eliminate seawater and expand land in the north of our country, the dike construction project on the Lauwers Sea coast (which could reclaim thousands of hectares of new land after the dike is built), the construction of houses, and the construction of roads.

	The problem of housing construction is particularly important, because in our country there are still 300,000 households living in very bad housing or living with relatives. To solve this problem, it is necessary to vigorously promote the construction of workers' housing. However, our government, which is composed of reactionary church parties and the Liberal Party, is building fewer and fewer cheap workers' houses, and more and more expensive houses. Therefore, there is no housing problem for the rich in our country; they can buy as big a house as they want. However, the children of workers who want to get married must wait many years to get a house, and they are often forced to squeeze into small houses with relatives, parents, or other people.

	Our Communist Party has formulated a program of action, which includes an urgent demand for the rapid construction of workers' housing. But the most important demand is to abandon the Cold War policy, withdraw from the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and improve relations with socialist countries.

	If these demands are accepted, it will be possible to use the main part of the funds now used for arms expansion (currently about two billion guilders) for housing construction and the Delta Plan.

	At this moment, the Soviet Union's tireless efforts to improve East-West relations have greatly supported the demand to abandon the Cold War policy. Our Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, his consistent insistence on the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence, and especially his proposal for complete disarmament within four years, have made a deep impression in our country. Although our Foreign Minister Luns immediately said after Khrushchev put forward his proposal, "This is just propaganda," I believe that this is not the opinion of the majority of the residents of our country. Most people ask why peaceful coexistence is not possible, why weapons cannot be recast into machines, and so on.

	Not long ago, many people in our country thought that war was inevitable. But now hope has been rekindled in everyone's heart that war can be avoided, and that different opinions can be resolved at the table rather than on the battlefield. The reason for this progress is not only due to the consistent implementation of a peaceful policy by the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, but also to the rapid progress made by the entire socialist camp.

	The fact that the Soviet Union launched the first rocket to the moon once again proves that the socialist camp is stronger than the imperialist camp.

	The socialist camp will soon far surpass the imperialist camp in the peace race. Dear Chinese comrades, your rapid speed in building your country and eliminating hundreds of years of backwardness is a moving example.

	As you now celebrate the tenth anniversary of your People's Republic, it is possible to say with firm conviction, "We can and we will catch up with Britain in ten years," which makes all peace-loving people around the world extremely happy.

	We Dutch Communists have drawn strength from the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of your Communist Party.

	May the friendship between our two countries grow and develop!

	Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the Dutch people!

	Long live the People's Republic of China!

	Long live the Communist Party of China!

	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!

	Long live Communism!

### 荷兰共产党中央委员会委员、荷兰共产党代表团团长  波素文同志的贺词

专栏：

    荷兰共产党中央委员会委员、荷兰共产党代表团团长
    波素文同志的贺词敬爱的同志们：
    我十分荣幸地代表荷兰共产党代表团在这次来自世界各地的共产党人的盛会上向你们致词。
    我们从荷兰来，向你们致以荷兰共产党人兄弟般的战斗敬礼，并向你们祝贺你们的伟大人民共和国成立十周年的国庆。
    我国的工人和一切进步人士以惊讶的心情和极大的喜悦注视着你们国家的飞速发展。
    如果一个国家的人民团结一致地在共产党的领导下前进，就会有无比灿烂的前途，你们的劳动和你们的成就就是一个新的证明。
    我们国家的居民，几百年来一直同洪水搏斗，并且是靠筑堤向大海夺取大部分的土地，因此，我们对你们同洪水斗争所取得的成就非常敬佩。我们懂得，当洪水逼来，河水猛涨的时候，要驯服汹涌的浪涛，是如何困难。我们很高兴地听到，你们建成了很多水利工程，使洪水无法泛滥。从这件事我们也看出，一个一切都是为了人民的人民政府和一个像我国只关心大卡特尔利益的资产阶级政府在所作所为之间有巨大的区别。
    我们也在进行大规模的水利工程，就是所谓三角洲计划。这个计划有两个目的：第一是保护我国东南部永不受海水侵犯，第二是要夺取几千公顷良田。迅速执行这个计划是有全民意义的，但是几年来这项工程却延缓下来了，因为政府不愿提供充足的经费。这种政策是政府追随北大西洋侵略集团扩军政策的恶果之一。
    不仅三角洲计划的执行由于这个政策而陷于瘫痪，而且扩军的庞大开支也使许多为了人民的利益必须进行的工作陷于停顿，例如，在我国北部排除海水扩大土地的工程、劳维尔海滨的筑堤工程（筑堤后可夺取几千公顷新土地）、建筑住宅和修建道路等等工作都停顿了。
    特别重要的是建筑住宅问题，因为在我国还有三十万户人家的住房很坏，或是住在亲戚家里。为解决这个问题必须大力提倡建筑工人住宅。但是我们的政府是由反动的教会党派和自由党所组成的，它的作法是便宜的工人住宅盖的越来越少，而昂贵的住宅却盖的越来越多。因此，在我国有钱人并不存在住房问题，他们愿意买多大的房子就可以买多大的房子。可是，要结婚的工人子女必须等待好多年才能得到一所房子，他们常常被迫挤在亲戚、父母或者别人家很小的房子里。
    我们共产党制定了一个行动纲领，其中有一个迫切的要求，就是迅速建筑工人住宅。但是最重要的要求是放弃冷战政策，退出侵略性的北大西洋公约组织，改善同社会主义国家的关系。
    如果这些要求被接受的话，那么就可能把现在用于扩军的经费（现在共约二十亿盾）的主要部分用于住宅建筑和三角洲计划等方面。
    正在这时候，苏联不倦地改善东西方关系的努力大大地支持了放弃冷战政策的要求。我们的赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，他一贯坚持和平共处的可能性和必要性，特别是他的四年内全部裁军的建议，在我国造成了深刻的印象。尽管我们的外交部长伦斯在赫鲁晓夫提出他的建议以后马上就说：“这不过是宣传”，但是我相信，这不是我国大多数居民的意见。大多数人都问，为什么不可以和平共处，不可以把兵器改铸成机器，等等。
    不久以前，在我国也有很多人以为战争是不可避免的。但是现在在所有的人心中又燃起了希望，认为战争是可以避免的，不同的意见可以在桌面上而不是在战场上解决。其所以有这种进展，我们不仅要感谢以苏联为首的社会主义国家一贯执行和平政策，而且同样要感谢整个社会主义阵营取得了飞跃进步。
    发射第一支火箭到达月球的是苏联，这个事实再一次证明社会主义阵营比帝国主义阵营强大。
    在和平竞赛中社会主义阵营不久也要远远超过帝国主义阵营。敬爱的中国同志们，你们用飞快的速度来建设你们的国家并消除几百年的落后状态，就是一个动人的例子。
    你们现在在庆祝你们的人民共和国十周年的时候，已经有可能以坚定的信念说：“我们可以而且我们将要在十年内赶上英国”，这使全世界一切爱好和平的人们感到极大的喜悦。
    我们荷兰共产党人，从在你们的共产党领导下的中国人民的伟大成就中吸取了力量。
    祝我们两国的友谊成长和发展！
    中国人民与荷兰人民的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东同志万岁！
    共产主义万岁！（附图片）
