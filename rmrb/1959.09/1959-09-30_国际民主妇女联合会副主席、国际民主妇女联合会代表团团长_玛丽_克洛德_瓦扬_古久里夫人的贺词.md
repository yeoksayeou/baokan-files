Mr. Chairman, dear friends:

	On behalf of the Women's International Democratic Federation, I would like to thank you for honoring us with a visit to your country on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	Some of us (including myself) visited China ten years ago, when Shanghai had only been liberated for a few months, and I saw the remnants of the old China before liberation.

	I saw people collecting corpses on the streets every morning, and hundreds of thousands of families had no place to live and could only live on small boats. Eight-year-old children had to work twelve hours in factories.

	Since then, residential buildings sufficient for 600,000 people have been built in Shanghai alone. Various social legislations have been promulgated and implemented, which has completely changed the fate of all workers in your great country.

	One member of our delegation could not recognize a cooperative she had seen only three years ago in the people's commune we visited. The changes that have taken place in this short period are so great.

	We are not only surprised by the improvement of the living standards of the entire Chinese people, but also by the quantity and quality of social achievements that many Western countries can envy. In particular, everything that has been done in the area of women's liberation, you have not only implemented equal pay for equal work for them, which no capitalist country has, but have also established a social welfare network, which is an indispensable undertaking for achieving true equality. We have visited many nurseries, kindergartens, public canteens and various factories in large cities and rural areas. These undertakings liberate women from household labor and enable them to fully develop. This is beneficial to them personally, and also beneficial to the country.

	We were deeply moved to see the smiles of thousands of happy children everywhere, and to see children and young people being cared for and loved. You are doing your best to fully develop them physically, intellectually and morally, so that they can become talents useful to the country and all mankind.

	The miraculous change in the living conditions of the Chinese people that we have seen since we came here is an example for many countries, and it is also an outstanding contribution to the cause of world peace. We would like to express our organization's deep gratitude to you for this contribution. The purpose of our organization is to defend women's rights, strive for children's happiness and defend peace.

	Therefore, we support all proposals that can lead to easing international tensions, eliminating the Cold War, banning atomic weapons and complete disarmament, as proposed recently by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, at the United Nations.

	Long live the exchanges, understanding and friendship between the people of all countries!

	Long live the People's Republic of China!

	Long live the national independence of the people of all countries!

	Long live world peace! (with picture)

### 国际民主妇女联合会副主席、国际民主妇女联合会代表团团长  玛丽—克洛德·瓦扬—古久里夫人的贺词

    国际民主妇女联合会副主席、国际民主妇女联合会代表团团长
    玛丽—克洛德·瓦扬—古久里夫人的贺词主席先生，亲爱的朋友们：
    我谨代表国际民主妇女联合会对你们在中华人民共和国成立十周年的时候，使我们荣幸地来访问你们的国家表示谢意。
    我们中间有些人（包括我在内）十年前来过中国，当时上海才解放几个月，我还看到解放前旧中国的陈迹。
    我当时看到每天早晨都有人在街道上收殓尸体，成千上万的家庭没有住处，只能住在小船上，八岁的儿童在工厂里要工作十二个小时。
    从那时以来，只在上海一个城市就修建了够六十万人住的住宅。各种社会立法已经颁布实行，这就使你们这个巨大的国家的一切劳动者的命运完全改变了。
    我们代表团中有一位团员在我们参观的人民公社里，竟认不出仅仅三年前她所看过的一个合作社。在这个短短的时期里所发生的变化竟是如此之大。
    我们感到惊奇的不仅仅是全中国人民的生活水平的提高，而且是足以使许多西方国家羡慕的社会成就的数量和质量。特别是在妇女解放方面所做的一切，你们不只是对她们实施了任何资本主义国家所没有的同工同酬，并且建立了社会福利事业网，这是为实现真正平等所不可缺少的事业。我们在大城市和农村里都参观访问了许多托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂和各种工厂，这些事业使妇女从家庭劳动中解放出来，并使她们获得充分的发展。这有利于她们个人，也有利于国家。
    我们在各处都看到成千上万幸福儿童的笑容，看到儿童和青年备受关怀和爱护，这使我们十分感动。你们竭尽全力使他们在体力、智力和道德方面得到充分发展，使他们能够成为对国家和全人类有用的人才。
    我们来到这里以后所看到的中国人民的生活情况奇迹般的改变，对许多国家来说是一个典范，同时也是对世界和平事业的一项卓越贡献。我们谨为你们这一贡献向你们表示我们组织的深切谢意，我们组织的目的就是保卫妇女权利、争取儿童幸福和保卫和平。
    因此，我们支持一切能够导致缓和国际紧张局势、消灭冷战、禁止原子武器和彻底裁军的建议，正如最近苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在联合国所提出的建议。
    各国人民之间的来往与了解和友谊的发展万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    各国人民的民族独立万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
