Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 18th: Nanjing City already has seventy-six factories that have overfulfilled their third-quarter output plans ahead of schedule by fifteen to twenty days. In the first half of September, the city's total industrial output value increased by 71.6% compared with the same period last month. Among the forty major products that have completed their third-quarter production plans ahead of schedule, the output of thirty-five products, including steel, iron, trucks, AC motors, transformers, telephones, electron tubes, and special light bulbs, has increased significantly compared with the same period last month.

The September industrial output value plans formulated by various factories and mining enterprises on the basis of initial criticism of right-leaning conservative thinking are on average nearly 50% higher than those of August. In the past half-month, the city's workers have launched an unprecedented competition movement to present gifts to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. All walks of life learn from each other, catch up with each other, cooperate with each other, and promote each other. It is truly a scene of "red flags flying everywhere, and pacesetters standing in great numbers." Many factories, from factory directors, party committee secretaries, production workers to cooks, health workers, typists, and telephone operators, have been swept into the torrent of competition. After the employees of Nanjing Radio Factory, Radio Factory, and Puzhen Factory launched a competition against each other, 266 workers have already completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule. In less than twenty days, the Mining Machinery Factory has realized 120 technical innovations that have increased work efficiency by three to thirty times. In early September, the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company, through technical innovation and other measures, increased the daily output of sulfuric acid by 29% compared with the same period last month, creating the highest daily output record since the company was founded. In the torrent of the mass movement, many cadres have improved their work style. The Party Secretary and Director of the Leap Forward Steel Plant both brought their bedding and came to the front of the furnace to study and solve production problems with the workers, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses.

    跨过三季度  快步迎国庆
    南京市已有七十六个工厂完成三季度产值计划
    新华社南京18日电　南京市已有七十六个工厂提前十五天到二十天超额完成了第三季度的产值计划。9月上半月，全市工业总产值比上月同期增长71.6％。已提前完成第三季产量计划的四十种主要产品中，钢、铁、载重汽车、交流电动机、变压器、电话机、电子管、特种灯泡等三十五种产品的产量，都比上月同期有大幅度的增长。
    各厂矿企业在初步批判右倾保守思想的基础上制订的9月份工业产值计划，平均比8月份提高近50％。半月来，全市职工展开了规模空前的向建国十周年献礼的竞赛运动，各行各业互相观摩，互相追赶，互相协作，互相促进，真是“红旗四起，标兵林立”。许多工厂从厂长、党委书记、生产工人到炊事员、保健员、打字员、电话员，都卷入了竞赛的洪流。南京有线电厂、无线电厂和浦镇工厂的职工开展对手竞赛后，已经有二百六十六个工人提前完成全年的生产任务。矿山机械厂在不到二十天的时间内，就实现了提高工效三倍至三十倍的技术革新一百二十项。南京化学工业公司9月上旬通过技术革新等措施，使硫酸日产量比上月同期提高29％，曾创造这个公司建厂以来的最高日产纪录。在群众运动的激流中，许多干部改进了工作作风。跃进钢铁厂党委书记和厂长都带着铺盖，来到炉前，同工人一起研究解决生产中的问题，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。
