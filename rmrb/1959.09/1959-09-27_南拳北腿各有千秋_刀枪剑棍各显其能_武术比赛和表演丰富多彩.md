Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The martial arts competition and performance of the First National Games concluded on the evening of the 25th. In this competition, Southern Fists and Northern Kicks each had their strengths, and swords, spears, clubs, and staves each displayed their abilities. Over the past four days, one hundred and seventy-three male and female martial artists (including thirty-nine female athletes) from twenty-five delegations across the country participated in a total of five hundred and forty-eight martial arts competitions and two hundred and twenty-four performance matches.

As a result of the competition, the Shanghai delegation, which has won first place many times in the past and has many veteran players, won the team total score championship. The rising star, the Jilin delegation, with its amazing progress, surpassed the long-standing excellent teams of Beijing, Shandong, and Heilongjiang to win the runner-up.

This competition fully demonstrated the richness, variety, and rapid development of China's long-standing national martial arts. In particular, after China unified the martial arts rules, athletes from all over the country greatly improved in terms of the difficulty, intensity, and beauty of the movements.

A total of one hundred and sixty-nine Changquan-style competitions and sixty Taijiquan-style competitions were held this time. The champions of these two categories were Shao Shankang and Yang Bingcheng of the Shanghai delegation, respectively. Shao Shankang was once famous for his unique Drunken Fist skills. Getting up at the crow of dawn and diligently practicing day after day for ten years has enabled him to acquire diverse talents. This time, he participated in the competition with Guandongquan (a type of Changquan), with movements that were light and clear, combining strength with gentleness, and displaying true skill in his leaps, bounds, jumps, vaults, falls, prostrations, rolls, and flips. Yang Bingcheng's Wu-style Taijiquan, on the other hand, combined gentleness with strength, was expansive and graceful, coordinated and beautiful, and was outstanding among the Taijiquan performances.

The competition for the championships in long and short weapons was very fierce. In the long weapons competition, Han Mingnan, a thirteen-year-old from Jilin, and Liu Hongren from Heilongjiang, both had solid spear skills. Their techniques were varied, powerful, and well-organized, with blocks, grabs, thrusts, chops, flourishing movements, clouds, and penetrations. Both of them scored 8.55 points. Later, considering their scores in fist techniques and short weapons, Han Mingnan won the championship. In the short weapons competition, Xu Xueyi from Shandong, who performed the Liuhe broadsword, was as brave as a fierce tiger, and Cheng Chuanrui from Beijing, who performed the Qimen sword, was as swift as a swimming dragon. Both of their movements were free and unconstrained, quick and agile. They both received 8.45 points. However, Xu Xueyi took the lead and won the championship based on his fist techniques. In addition, four female athletes won the top eight places in short weapons and Taijiquan, respectively. Among them, Fan Gui'e (Shandong), the youngest (twelve years old), performed the Baxian sword and won the fourth place in short weapons.

The two hundred and twenty-four performance matches were also wonderful. Among them, there were fifty-seven sparring matches. For a time, the arena became a scene of flashing swords and daggers, with performances of close combat. The conference will select twenty-four outstanding performers based on their martial arts level and award them prizes along with the competition events. (Attached picture)

    南拳北腿各有千秋　刀枪剑棍各显其能
    武术比赛和表演丰富多彩
    据新华社26日讯　第一届全国运动会武术比赛和表演赛25日晚结束。这次比赛中，南拳北腿、各有千秋，刀枪剑棍，各献其能。全国二十五个代表队的一百七十三名男女武士（其中三十九名女选手），四天来共进行了五百四十八项武术比赛和二百二十四项表演赛。
    比赛结果，团体总分冠军为历年来多次荣获第一的、拥有多名老将的上海代表队获得。后起之秀吉林代表队，以惊人的进步压过了多年优秀队北京、山东、黑龙江而夺取了亚军。
    这次比赛充分显示了我国历史悠久的民族武术的丰富多彩和飞跃发展。特别是在我国统一了武术规则后，各地选手无论在武术的难度、运动强度和动作的优美各方面都大大提高了。
    这次长拳类比赛项目共进行了一百六十九种，太极拳类共进行了六十种。这两类的冠军分别为上海代表队选手邵善康和杨炳诚获得。邵善康曾经以独一无二的绝技醉拳出名，十年如一日的闻鸡起舞，刻苦锻炼，使他获得了多方面的才能。这次他以关东拳（长拳类的一种）参加比赛，窜、蹦、跳、跃、跌、仆、滚、翻，各种动作轻盈清晰，刚中有柔，练出了功夫。而杨炳诚的吴氏太极拳，却是柔中有刚，舒展大方，协调优美，为这次太极拳中的出类拔萃者。
    长器械和短器械的比赛中，争夺冠军都非常激烈。长器械比赛中，吉林十三岁的选手韩明男和黑龙江的选手刘洪仁，枪法都有素养。拦、拿、扎、劈、舞花、云、穿，枪法多变，刚劲有力，有条不紊。两个人得分都是八点五五分。后来参考他们两个人拳术和短器械的成绩，韩明男荣获冠军。短器械比赛中，山东的徐学义和北京成传锐，前者表演的是六合刀，勇如猛虎，后者表演的是奇门剑，势如游龙。两个人动作都是洒脱大方，迅速灵活。同时都得到八点四五分。只是在参考拳术中，徐学义领先而得到冠军。此外，有四名女选手分别获得短器械和太极拳前八名名次。其中年龄最小（十二岁）的范桂峨（山东），练的一把八仙剑，获得短器械的第四名。
    二百二十四项表演赛也很精彩。其中，有五十七项对练。一时场地上出现了刀光剑影，短兵相接的撕杀表演场面。大会将根据他们武术的水平，挑选出二十四项成绩优异者，和比赛项目同时发奖。（附图片）
