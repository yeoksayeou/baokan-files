Steel Production Reached 6.25 Million Tons in the First Seven Months of This Year

Steel increased by 67% over the same period last year, iron increased by 150%, and steel materials increased by 30%

In the first 25 days of August, steel, iron, and steel materials increased by 10.4%, 5.3%, and 14.6% respectively compared to the same period last month.

Small blast furnaces built on the basis of indigenous furnaces produced nearly half of the nation's pig iron.

Xinhua News Agency, August 31st. Since the beginning of this year, China's iron and steel industry production has been flourishing and presenting a bright picture.

From January to July, the national steel production, excluding indigenous steel produced and used locally, has reached 6.25 million tons, an increase of 67% compared to the same period last year. Pig iron and steel material production also increased by 150% and 30% respectively compared to the same period last year. In August, iron and steel workers across the country launched a new high tide of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and iron and steel production continued to rise. From the 1st to the 25th, national steel, pig iron, and steel materials increased by 10.4%, 5.3%, and 14.6% respectively compared to the same period in July. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were announced, they greatly encouraged the workers on the iron and steel industry front, and the output in the last few days of the month is rising at an even faster rate. According to this growth rate, it is estimated that this year's steel production (excluding indigenous steel) is fully guaranteed to increase to 12 million tons, achieving the highest steel production target set in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule.

The quality of steel products has also improved rapidly this year. In July, the qualification rates of pig iron, open-hearth steel, and electric furnace steel in key national iron and steel enterprises had increased to 95%, 98.3%, and 97.33% respectively. The product quality of the two new forces that have been built up successively since the end of last year—small blast furnaces and converters—is also advancing by leaps and bounds. In July, the qualification rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces nationwide reached about 75%, with several provinces reaching over 90%. The qualification rate of converter steel nationwide has increased to 92%.

Another sign showing the continued leap forward in China's iron and steel industry is that China can now produce more than 500 types of alloy steel and high-quality steel, and more than 6,000 types of steel materials, many of which are new products this year. China can now rely more on its own steel products to supply various sectors of the national economy.

The brilliant achievements made by the iron and steel industry this year are the result of implementing the Party's general line and a complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," as well as carrying out mass movements in iron and steel enterprises. This year, the construction scale of China's iron and steel industry is much larger than in previous years, with a large number of ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling equipment added. In terms of the construction of large and medium-sized enterprises, in the past seven months alone, more than a dozen large and medium-sized blast furnaces have been built and put into production. During the First Five-Year Plan period, only eight large blast furnaces were built. The construction of small enterprises has flourished everywhere. Since the end of last year, small blast furnaces developed and built on the basis of indigenous furnaces have had a volume of 43,000 cubic meters, and they are now gloriously undertaking nearly half of the national pig iron production task. The volume of new converters built in the past six months or so is more than ten times the original converter volume in China in the first half of last year. Today, what is presented to the people of the country by the iron and steel industry is an inspiring new picture: large enterprises newly built or renovated in Anshan, Wuhan, Baotou, Shijingshan, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Chongqing, etc., are growing up and fully playing their huge role; most provinces and autonomous regions in the country already have or are building medium-sized iron and steel enterprises. In addition, there are ironmaking bases formed by thousands of small blast furnaces, scattered all over the country.

Another major achievement in China's iron and steel industry production this year is the systematic summary of a series of advanced experiences of high yield, high quality, and low cost, including the experience of ironmaking, converter steelmaking, electric furnace steelmaking, and other production departments, which are being promoted in various places. These experiences are the crystallization of the rich production practice and wisdom of the vast number of iron and steel workers since the Great Leap Forward last year. For example, in ironmaking, last year, among large and medium-sized blast furnaces, only a very small number of blast furnaces had a monthly average utilization coefficient (that is, the pig iron output per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night) of more than 2. This year, after summarizing and promoting the advanced operating experience of "simultaneously improving smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio," since April and May, the utilization coefficients of two large blast furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel, a medium-sized blast furnace in Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and a medium-sized blast furnace in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have all reached more than 2, and are constantly rising. In July, the utilization coefficient of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide increased by 21% compared to January. After the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry summarized the ten advanced experiences of small blast furnace production and promoted them across the country, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in July has approached 0.7, the qualification rate of pig iron has increased to about 75%, and the cost has gradually decreased.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, China's steel production was known to the world for its high growth rate of 31.7% per year. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, steel production (excluding indigenous steel) reached 8 million tons, an increase of 49.5% compared to 1957. And this year, steel production will reach 12 million tons, another leap of 50% compared to 1958. In the five years of the First Five-Year Plan period, China's steel production increased by 4 million tons; while in the two years of last year and this year, steel production will increase by 6.65 million tons.

In sharp contrast to the Great Leap Forward in China's iron and steel industry is the bleak situation in the capitalist world. In 1958, steel production in the United States, West Germany, Britain, and Japan all declined, with steel production in the United States falling by 24.5% compared to 1957. In the first half of this year, steel production in Britain and West Germany continued to decline. It took the United States nine years, Britain thirty-three years, and Japan from 1936 to 1957 to increase steel production from about 5 million tons to about 12 million tons.

    继续贯彻总路线、继续“两条腿走路”、继续大搞群众运动
    今年头七月产钢625万吨
    比去年同期钢增长67％，铁增长150％，钢材增长30％
    八月前25天，钢、铁、钢材分别比上月同期增长10.4％、5.3％、14.6％
    在土炉群基础上建设起来的小高炉生产了将近全国一半的生铁
    新华社31日讯　今年以来，我国钢铁工业生产正欣欣向荣，呈现一片光明景象。
    1月到7月全国钢产量，不包括各地自产自用的土钢在内，已达六百二十五万吨，比去年同期增长了67％，生铁和钢材产量也比去年同期分别增加了150％和30％。8月份各地钢铁职工掀起了增产节约运动的新高潮，钢铁生产更是节节上升。1日到25日，全国钢、生铁和钢材，又分别比7月份同期增长了10.4％、5.3％和14.6％；中共八届八中全会的公报和决议公布后，大大鼓舞了钢铁工业战线上的职工，月终几天的产量正以更快的速度上升着。按照这个增长速度，预计今年钢产量（不包括土钢）完全有把握提高到一千二百万吨，提前三年实现第二个五年计划规定的钢产量最高指标。
    今年钢铁产品质量也提高得很快。7月份全国重点钢铁企业的生铁，平炉钢、电炉钢的合格率已经分别提高到了95％、98.3％和97.33％；从去年年底以后才陆续建设起来的两支新生力量——小高炉和转炉，产品质量也在突飞猛进。7月份全国小高炉生铁合格率达到了75％左右，其中有几个省已达到90％以上；全国转炉钢的合格率已提高到92％。
    显示我国钢铁工业继续跃进的另一个标志是，我国目前已能生产五百多种合金钢、优质钢和六千多种钢材，其中有许多是今年的新产品。我国已经可以更多地依靠自己生产的钢铁产品来供应国民经济各部门了。
    钢铁工业今年取得的光辉成就，是贯彻执行了党的总路线和一整套用“两条腿走路”的方针，以及在钢铁企业中开展群众运动的结果。今年我国钢铁工业的建设规模比往年大得多，增加了一大批炼铁、炼钢和轧钢设备。在大中型企业建设方面七个月来仅是建设和投入生产的大型中型高炉就有十多座，而在第一个五年计划期间，只不过建成了八座大型高炉。小型企业的建设更是遍地开花。从去年年底开始，在土炉群的基础上发展建设起来的小高炉，已经有四万三千立方米的容积，目前它们光荣地担负着全国生铁产量中将近一半的任务。半年多以来新建转炉的容积，比去年上半年我国原有的转炉容积增加了十多倍。今天，钢铁工业展现在全国人民面前的，是一幅振奋人心的新图景：鞍山、武汉、包头、石景山、太原、上海、重庆等新建或改建的大型企业，正在成长起来，并且充分发挥它的巨大作用；全国绝大部分省、自治区已经有或者正在建设中型钢铁企业。此外，还有由数千座小高炉形成的炼铁基点，星罗棋布全国各地。
    今年我国钢铁工业生产上还有一个重大的成就，就是系统地总结了一系列高产、优质、低成本的先进经验，包括炼铁、转炉炼钢、电炉炼钢和其他生产部门的经验，正在各地推广。这些经验是去年大跃进以来广大钢铁职工丰富的生产实践和智慧创造的结晶，譬如炼铁方面，去年在大中型高炉当中，还只有极少数高炉利用系数（即每立方米高炉容积每昼夜的生铁产量）月平均达到二以上，今年总结和推广了“提高冶炼强度和降低焦比同时并举”的先进操作经验后，4、5月份以来，鞍钢两座大型高炉、本溪钢铁公司的中型高炉和太原钢铁公司的一座中型高炉，利用系数都达到了二以上，并且不断上升。7月份全国大中型高炉的利用系数比1月份提高了21％。冶金工业部总结的小高炉生产的十项先进经验，在全国各地推广后，7月份小高炉的平均利用系数已经接近0.7，生铁合格率提高到了75％左右，成本也逐步降低了。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国钢产量曾以每年增长31.7％的高速度闻名于世。大跃进的1958年，钢产量（不包括土钢）达到八百万吨，比1957年增长了49.5％。而今年，钢产量达到一千二百万吨，又将比1958年跃增50％。第一个五年计划期内的五年，我国钢产量曾经增长了四百万吨；而去年和今年两年，钢产量将增长六百六十五万吨。
    跟我国钢铁工业大跃进成鲜明对照的，是资本主义世界的一片萧条景况。1958年美国、西德、英国、日本的钢产量都开了倒车，其中美国的钢产量比1957年下降了24.5％。今年上半年，英国和西德的钢产量继续下降。他们把钢产量从五百多万吨提高到一千二百万吨左右，美国付出了九年，英国付出了三十三年，日本从1936年开始直到1957年才达到这个水平。
