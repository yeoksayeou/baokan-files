Xinhua News Agency, September 14th. China's first high-speed general-purpose electronic digital computer, capable of performing 10,000 operations per second, has been successfully trial-produced. It has been installed in the Institute of Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is one of the gifts presented by scientific institutions to celebrate the 10th anniversary of National Day. On the afternoon of September 4th, a reporter from this agency visited this large-scale electronic digital computer, which marks the level of China's computing technology. Around the four walls of the 180-square-meter room stood rows of large iron cabinets, containing 4,200 electron tubes and 4,000 semiconductor transistors, as well as various complex components such as magnetic cores, magnetic drums, and magnetic tape drives. The inside and outside of the iron cabinets were filled with tens of thousands of wire connectors and a large number of small light bulbs and switches, even denser than spider webs and the stars on a summer night. In the center of the room was the central control console, where mathematicians and their assistants operated it. After the mathematical problems to be calculated by the machine were compiled into a "program," they were punched onto paper tape. However, the paper tape did not show numbers or symbols, but small holes arranged in various ways. After the paper tape was fed into the machine, it underwent a series of operations, and finally, the calculation results were printed out by a high-speed automatic typewriter. That automatic typewriter could print fifteen lines of text per second on paper, with twelve characters per line. What it printed on paper were no longer small holes but numbers and symbols. One of the differences between digital electronic computers and analog electronic computers is that the results calculated by analog electronic computers are not numbers but curves displayed on the fluorescent screen.

On April 19th of this year, this large-scale high-speed electronic digital computer calculated its first problem – the calculation of the design table for the Northeast underground drainage system. Subsequently, it has solved and is solving many complex computational problems in national construction: multiple simultaneous algebraic equations in engineering design, differential equations for calculating "transient phenomena" in construction engineering, vibration equations (partial differential equations) in engineering design, adjustment calculations for surveying and mapping in geodesy, calculations of the "unsteady flow" of the Yangtze River for the future Three Gorges Hydropower Project, calculations of stress analysis for the future Liujiaxia Dam and the Three Gorges Dam, calculations of medium- and short-term numerical weather forecasting, and calculations of railway line selection schemes, etc. Last year, the Institute of Computing Technology used manual labor to calculate the "unsteady flow" of the Yangtze River, which took sixty people a week. Now, in order to verify the results of last year's calculations, this electronic computer was used, which took only two minutes and more, and was more accurate than manual calculation. According to the capabilities of this type of electronic computer, it can solve generally extremely complex computational problems in scientific research and engineering technology, such as certain computational problems related to artificial satellites, etc.

This electronic computer was researched and trial-produced by the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other relevant departments, factories, and research institutions in cooperation, based on technical data provided by the Soviet Union and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts. According to the plan formulated by the Institute of Computing Technology at the beginning of 1958, this electronic computer would not be basically completed until the end of this year. However, during the Great Leap Forward last year, research technicians and workers liberated their minds, worked hard and cleverly day and night, which enabled this arduous task to be completed by the end of 1958 in terms of manufacturing and assembly work, and machine adjustment began. After further adjustment and stabilization work in the continued Great Leap Forward this year, it began to calculate problems in April of this year.

    我国首架电子数字计算机制成
    每秒钟运算一万次，能精确算出极复杂的计算问题
    新华社14日讯　我国第一架每秒钟能运算一万次的快速通用电子数字计算机试制成功。它被安装在中国科学院技术研究所里。这是科学机关呈献给国庆十周年的礼品之一。9月4日下午，本社记者参观了这架标志我国计算技术水平的大型电子数字计算机。在一百八十平方米的大房间的四周，放着成排的大铁柜，里面装着四千二百个电子管和四千个半导体晶体管，以及磁心、磁鼓、磁带机等各种复杂的机件；在铁柜的里里外外，布满了数以万计的电线接头和大批的小灯泡小开关，比蜘蛛网和夏夜的星星还密。室中间是中央控制台，由数学家和他的助手在那里操纵。要请这架机器运算的数学题目编好“程序”以后，打在纸带上。但是在纸带上看不出数目字和符号，却是各式各样地排列着的小孔。纸带放入机器后，经过一系列的运算，最后从一架高速度的自动打字机打出计算结果来。那架自动打字机每秒钟能在纸上打出十五行字，每行十二个字，它打在纸上的不再是小孔而是数目字和符号了。数字电子计算机和模拟电子计算机的区别之一，就是模拟电子计算机算出的结果不是数目字，而是表现在萤光屏上的曲线。
    今年4月19日，这架大型快速电子数字计算机算出了第一个题目——东北地下水道设计表的计算。接着，它又解决了和正在解决着国家建设中许多复杂的计算问题：工程设计中的多元联立代数方程式，建筑工程中计算“暂态现象”的微分方程，工程设计中的震动方程——偏微分方程，大地测量中测绘的平差计算，为未来长江三峡水利枢纽进行的长江“不稳定流”的计算，未来的刘家峡水坝和长江三峡水坝应力分析的计算，中期短期天气数值预报的计算，铁路线路选择方案的计算等等。去年计算技术研究所曾用人力计算过长江的“不稳定流”，六十个人算了一星期。现在为了核对去年计算的结果，运用这架电子计算机计算，只花了两分多钟，而且比人工计算得精确。按照这一类型的电子计算机的功能，科学研究和工程技术中一般极复杂的计算问题它都可以解决，例如关于人造卫星的某些计算问题等等。
    这架电子计算机是由中国科学院计算技术研究所和其他有关部门、工厂以及研究机关合作，根据苏联提供的技术资料和在苏联专家的具体帮助下研究试制成功的。按照计算技术研究所1958年年初制订的计划，这架电子计算机要到今年年底才能基本完成。但是在去年大跃进中，研究技术人员和工人解放了思想，不分昼夜地苦干巧干，使得这一艰巨的任务提前到1958年年底就完成了制造装配工作，而且开始了机器的调整，再经过今年继续跃进中的进一步调整和稳定工作，到今年4月就开始计算题目。
