    The Guizhou women's volleyball team has a unique style: simple, modest, not arrogant in victory, and not discouraged in defeat. In this National Games final, they earned the good reputation of "learning from everyone."

    The Guizhou women's volleyball team is a new force. In the 1956 National Volleyball League (Second Division), they only managed third place. In the 1957 league, they defeated the Public Security women's team and the strong Yunnan team, jumping to second place. In 1958, they were promoted to the First Division and achieved eighth place in the First Division league. In this National Games, among the twelve women's volleyball teams, the Guizhou women's team was relatively weak in terms of technique, and their on-the-spot competition experience was not much. But when it came to drive, their momentum was truly magnificent and overwhelming. Despite encountering strong teams and suffering setbacks since the start of the finals, they were not discouraged. They still set themselves the task of striving for the top: ensuring seventh place and striving for the top six.

    Of the twelve players on the Guizhou women's team, ten are from Guizhou. More than half are newcomers to the volleyball court, with only one to two years of competition experience. Main player number nine, Zhang Liwei, was unable to play in the National First Division Women's Volleyball League held in Chengdu last August, but now she has become an outstanding spiker in the team. Other players have also made rapid progress.

    Before coming to Beijing to participate in the competition, they repeatedly discussed their action plan. This plan stipulated: go all out and do their best to ensure a relatively good level of play. However, they were absolutely not allowed to have a simple championship-first mentality, but instead had to humbly learn the excellent techniques and fine style of each sister team. In learning, they advocated modesty and perseverance.

    Before the finals began, they invited eight sister teams, including "Beijing," "Bayi," and "Wuhan," to practice with them. During the matches, they not only recorded the opponent's offensive tactics, lineup changes, offensive routes, and the posture of serves and first passes, but also recorded their own tactics and shortcomings. Each player who played had to summarize their successful experiences and lessons learned from the game, and players who did not play also had to record the good tactics of both sides during the game. After the match, they used the records of coaches and players as the basis for discussing and improving their offensive and defensive tactics.

    When the Guizhou women's volleyball team looked for teachers, they always frankly told the other party their intentions and asked for help. Before their match with the People's Liberation Army women's team, they told the other party the tactics they had prepared:
  "We are prepared to use this set of tactics to defeat you." They wanted the other party to take countermeasures to counterattack. They would then discover their loopholes and find ways to improve. In the game against the Beijing team, they also clearly told the other party that they wanted to learn offense, because the Beijing team's offensive routes were clear and accurate. At the same time, they also asked the Beijing team what they needed from them, and then took it out without reservation for the sister teams to refer to.

    They played against strong teams and also against weaker teams. The Jilin team was a Second Division team, but they believed that each had its own strengths, and still brought out all their personnel and housekeeping skills. Although all the "intelligence officers" of the various women's teams participating in the finals were present to observe the battle that day, the Guizhou women's volleyball team still did not hide its characteristics. Their idea was: We want to learn the excellent techniques of the sister teams, and we also want to take our own excellent techniques out. Especially in the practice match with the People's Liberation Army women's volleyball team, the PLA women's team knew that the Guizhou women's team's number twelve had a powerful spike and wanted to find a way to receive the ball, so the Guizhou team sent number twelve on the court to attack and spike fiercely, giving the PLA team a chance to practice, and at the same time learned some new offensive tactics from the PLA team.

    In this way, the Guizhou women's volleyball team saw and learned many good techniques from the sister teams in just over ten days, such as the flexible defense of the Guangdong women's volleyball team, the hard work of the Jilin team's first pass, the combination of fierce and skillful serves of the Yunnan team, and the diversified offensive routes of the PLA team...

    处处拜师傅的贵州女排
    本报记者　莎荫
    贵州女子排球队具有一种独特的风格：朴实、虚心，胜不骄，败不馁。在这次参加全运会决赛中，她们得到了“处处拜师傅”的好名声。
    贵州女子排球队是一支新军。1956年参加全国排球乙级队联赛中，仅仅是个第三名。1957年联赛中就力胜公安女子队和实力雄厚的云南队，跃居第二名。1958年就晋升为甲级队，并且在甲级联赛中取得第八名。这次参加全运会，十二个女排球队中，论技术，贵州女队的实力是比较弱的，临场比赛经验也不多，但讲起干劲来，可真是气势磅礴，排山倒海。尽管决赛开始以来，虽历遇强队，连遭挫折，但她们并不气馁，仍然给自己提出了力争上游的任务：确保第七，力争前六名。
    贵州女队十二个队员中，有十个是贵州人。一半以上是排球场上的新手，参加比赛不过一年到二年。主力九号张丽维，去年8月在成都举行全国甲级女排联赛时还上不了场，现在却成了队里一把出色的攻手。其他一些队员也都进步很快。
    这次来北京参加比赛以前，她们就反复讨论了行动计划。这个计划中规定：鼓足干劲，全力以赴，保证打出比较好的水平来。但是绝不允许有单纯的打前几名的锦标主义思想，而要虚心学习各姊妹队的优秀技术和优良作风。在学习上，她们提倡虚怀若谷，顽强不懈。
    决赛开始以前，她们邀请“北京”、“八一”、“武汉”等八个姊妹队作练习比赛。比赛中，她们不仅记录对方的进攻战术、阵容变化、进攻路线，以及发球、第一传的姿势等，而且还记录自己的战术和优缺点。每个上场队员要总结自己在比赛中的成功经验和失败教训，不上场的队员也要记录双方队员比赛中好的战术。比赛完毕以后，就以教练和队员的记录为主，讨论和改进自己的进攻和防守战术。
    贵州女子排球队在找师傅的时候，总是开诚布公地把自己的意图告诉对方，请求帮助。她们和解放军女队比赛以前，把准备好的战术告诉对方：
  “我们准备用这套战术打败你们。”要对方采取措施反击，她们则发现自己的漏洞后再设法提高。在同北京队赛时，她们也清楚地告诉对方，她们想学进攻。因为北京队的进攻路线明确、准确。同时也征求北京队需要她们的什么，然后无保留地拿出去，供姊妹队参考。
    她们约强队打，也约弱队打。吉林队是乙级队，但是她们认为各有长处，仍然拿出了全部人马和看家本领。虽然那天参加决赛的各个女队的“情报员”们全部临场观阵，贵州女排仍然没有隐藏自己的特色。她们的想法是：我们要学姊妹队的优秀技术，也要把自己的优秀技术拿出去。特别是和解放军女排练习赛中，解放军女队知道贵州女队十二号的扣球厉害，想找到接球的办法，贵州队就调十二号上场，猛攻猛扣，给解放军队以练习的机会，同时也学到了解放军队的一些新的进攻战术。
    就是这样，贵州女子排球队在短短十几天中看到和学到了姊妹队的许多好技术，诸如广东女排的灵活防守，吉林队第一传的硬工夫，云南队猛、巧结合的发球，解放军队的多样化的进攻路线……。
