Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 6th: After a bumper harvest of early rice, the broad masses of commune members in Anhui Province are now harvesting mid-season rice with immense joy. As of September 4th, over 5.93 million mu of mid-season rice had been harvested throughout the province. Huaining County, which started earlier, has already completed its harvest.

	This year, when the mid-season rice in various parts of the province was tasseling and filling, urgently requiring irrigation, it was hit by a drought. The anti-drought struggle coincided with the time of harvesting early rice and rushing to transplant late rice, resulting in a very tight labor situation. However, thanks to the full utilization of the superiority of the People's Communes, a bumper harvest of mid-season rice was still ensured. This year, all localities have been ensuring thorough threshing and good processing during the mid-season rice harvest, with every grain going into the granary.

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, September 5th: More than 7.8 million mu of mid-season rice in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is beginning to ripen. Guilin Prefecture, where the season is earlier, has already harvested over 660,000 mu, accounting for 34% of the mid-season rice area. Sanmen Commune in Longsheng Autonomous County has already harvested over 40 mu of mid-season rice, with an average yield increase of over 30% compared to last year. Although Lingui County suffered from drought and floods, most communes still increased production by more than 10% compared to last year.

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, September 5th: Good news of a bumper rice harvest has spread from Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province, where the Dong, Miao, and other ethnic groups reside. The 11,800 mu of rice already harvested by the county's twelve People's Communes have been inspected and accepted, with an average yield of 750 jin per mu, an increase of 30% in yield per unit area compared to last year.

	After the realization of communization throughout the county in early winter last year, the People's Communes thoroughly changed the backward farming methods of the past in this remote mountainous area of Guizhou, where people pulled plows and used wooden plows and wooden harrows. They organized a labor force of nearly 100,000 people to engage in a major battle throughout the winter and spring, deep plowing 200,000 mu of paddy fields, accounting for about 60% of the county's cultivated land. This year, field management has also been more meticulous than in previous years, with the rice seedlings weeded and top-dressed two or three times. They also overcame the drought, thus achieving a bumper harvest.

    安徽广西收割中稻
    贵州榕江水稻单产增加三成
    据新华社合肥6日电　安徽省各地广大社员继早稻丰收之后，又以无比喜悦的心情，收割中稻。到9月4日的统计，全省已收割中稻五百九十三万多亩。动手较早的怀宁县已全部割完。
    全省各地中稻，今年正在抽穗灌浆、急需润水的时候，遭受到旱灾的袭击。在抗旱斗争紧张的时候，也正是收割早稻和抢插晚稻的时候，劳力很紧张。但由于充分发挥了人民公社的优越性，仍然保证了中稻的丰收。今年各地在收割中稻时都做到了摔好打好，颗粒归仓。
    据新华社南宁5日电　广西僮族自治区七百八十多万亩中稻开始黄熟。季节较早的桂林专区已收割六十六万多亩，占中稻面积34％。龙胜各族自治县三门公社已收的四十多亩中稻，平均亩产比去年增产三成多。临桂县中稻虽受旱涝灾害，多数公社仍比去年增产一成以上。
    据新华社贵阳5日电　贵州省侗、苗等族聚居的贵州榕江县，传出了水稻丰收的喜讯。全县十二个人民公社已收割的一万一千八百亩水稻，经过验收，平均每亩七百五十斤，比去年单位面积产量增加三成。
    去年初冬，全县实现公社化以后，各人民公社彻底改变了过去贵州边沿山区用人拉犁和使用木犁、木耙的落后耕作方法，组织了近十万劳动大军，大战一冬一春，深翻了占全县耕地面积60％左右的二十万亩稻田。今年田间管理工作也比往年更细致，禾苗都薅追了两三道。还战胜了干旱，因此取得了丰收。
