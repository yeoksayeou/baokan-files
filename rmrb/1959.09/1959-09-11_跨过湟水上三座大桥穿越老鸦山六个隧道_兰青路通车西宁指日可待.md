Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 10th: After entering Qinghai Province, the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway has successively crossed three bridges over the Huangshui River, a tributary of the Yellow River, in late August and early September, and traversed six tunnels in Laoya Gorge, rapidly advancing westward towards rail laying to Xining. Currently, the railway is only forty-eight kilometers away from Xining, with only the Huangshui No. 8 Bridge and the Sha Tao Chuan Bridge remaining to be erected. The date of opening to traffic to Xining is imminent.

Laoya Gorge features high mountains, steep slopes, and narrow valleys. Within six kilometers, the railway must pass through six tunnels of various sizes, totaling more than 1,200 meters in length, and two large bridges. Construction workers, since starting construction in May last year, completely opened up the Laoya Gorge valley by March this year, taking only eleven months. Recently, the track-laying and bridge-erection workers completed the track-laying and bridge-erection work on this section in just over ten days. During the erection of the Huangshui No. 6 Bridge, leading cadres, technicians, and workers combined their efforts to research and develop a series of technical measures, such as laying double turnouts at the bridgehead and improving the auxiliary derrick's beam lifting, completing the bridge erection more than twelve hours ahead of the original plan.

Since the official opening of the Hekou-Minhe section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway on August 4th, it has transported more than 30,000 tons of various construction materials and commodities into Qinghai Province, and transported more than 10,000 tons of hides, minerals, and other goods out of Qinghai. During this period, more than 20,000 passengers traveled in and out of Qinghai by train.

    跨过湟水上三座大桥穿越老鸦山六个隧道
    兰青路通车西宁指日可待
    新华社西宁10日电　兰青铁路进入青海境内后，又连续在8月下旬和9月初跨过黄河支流湟水上的三座大桥，穿越老鸦峡的六座隧道，迅速向西宁铺轨前进。现在，铁路距西宁只有四十八公里，中间只剩下湟水八号大桥和沙淘川大桥两座大桥尚待架梁。通车到西宁的日期已指日可待。
    老鸦峡峡谷山高坡陡，沟谷狭窄，在六公里内铁路要穿过总长一千二百多米的六座大小隧道和两座大桥。筑路职工从去年5月施工以来，到今年3月就全部打通了老鸦峡峡谷，前后只用了十一个月时间。最近，铺轨架桥工人在十几天内就完成了这一段的铺轨架桥工程。在架设湟水六号大桥时，领导干部、技术人员和工人“三结合”，研究出在桥头铺设双开岔道，改进辅助扒杆的吊梁等一系列技术措施，比原订计划提前十二个多小时将桥梁架设完毕。
    兰青铁路自8月4日河口——民和段正式通车到现在，已经运进青海境内各种建设物资和商品三万多吨，从青海运出的皮张、矿石等有一万多吨。这一期间，乘火车进出青海的旅客有两万多人。
