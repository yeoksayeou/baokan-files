Seeing Treasures
—Excerpts from the National Archives Work Exhibition
	By our reporter Wang Boqing

There are many treasures at the exhibition. These treasures are not jewels, but they have a radiance that jewels cannot compare with; jewels glitter and dazzle, but these treasures forever illuminate people's hearts. These are the revolutionary historical archives that reflect the pace of the revolution.

	“Our World”

"Look, how much the Party cares for us...." In front of the first exhibit in the comprehensive hall, visitors constantly expressed various heartfelt sentiments. Displayed here is a photocopy of the original draft of the "Document Disposal Method" stipulated by the Party Central Committee in 1931. The draft was written by Comrade Qu Qiubai himself. At that time, the Chinese revolution was still a "spark," but the lines of the manuscript were filled with confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolution and contained the Party's infinite concern for archival work. The "Document Disposal Method" concludes with a general note stating, "If possible, the most ideal would of course be to have two copies of each type, one for reading and one for storage in the warehouse, to be submitted to the Party History Committee in the future." Under the words "in the future" in the last sentence, Comrade Qu Qiubai specially drew a parenthetical note, writing, "Our World." The martyr's posthumous writings encourage the descendants of the new China. At the exhibition, after seeing all thirty-two halls, many visitors were reluctant to leave and returned to the first exhibit to read it carefully again.

Proclamation of the Chinese Soviet Republic

"Chairman Mao's name is here!" In the Jiangxi Hall, people were delighted to see the first proclamation of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic, signed by Chairman Mao. The proclamation declared to the suffering Chinese people that the First National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of the Chinese Soviet was held in the Jiangxi Soviet area in November 1931, resolving the program, land law, and labor law, and announcing the establishment of the Chinese Soviet Republic.

In front of this proclamation from twenty-eight years ago, some visitors gently read the names of the members of the Provisional Central Government Committee on the proclamation: Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Qu Qiubai, Xiang Ying.... Some jointly recalled the events of the Second Revolutionary Civil War. A young comrade said, "Many of us were not even born at that time, but the Party and Chairman Mao had already made arrangements for the fate of the Chinese nation. We are so lucky!"

This proclamation, more than two feet long and wide, also has a touching story: This proclamation was originally collected by a rural cadre in the Jiangxi Soviet area. After the Red Army's Long March northward, the cadre was captured by the Kuomintang reactionaries. He suffered severe torture, but he still managed to hand the proclamation over to his daughter-in-law, asking her to keep it safe and sound, ready to welcome the victory of the revolution. After the liberation of Jiangxi, this woman, who inherited her father-in-law's will, found the proclamation and handed it over to the government.

	“Cooperative Farming Society”

"Thank you, Land Committee, for everything for the masses. We run a cooperative farming society, and we will never be poor again." What a warm and heartfelt sound! This is a folk song from that era. What is a "cooperative farming society"? In the Guangxi Hall of the exhibition, a well-preserved "Regulations on Cooperative Farming Societies" promulgated by the Youjiang Soviet Government of Guangxi tells us everything.

In 1930, the Youjiang Soviet Government of Guangxi, on the basis of land distribution, led the people in some areas to establish cooperative farming societies. At that time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, special envoy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and secretary of the Guangxi Front Committee of the Communist Party of China, led the people in Donglan County and Nalun County to establish cooperative farming societies. People saw that the "Regulations on Cooperative Farming Societies" included nine parts: general principles, land management, cultivation, tools, fertilizers, distribution of agricultural products, construction, discipline, and supplementary provisions. The production team of the cooperative farming society was led by the team leader, and production tools such as plowing oxen and harrows were uniformly allocated according to the labor force and land of each team. The harvested grain was gathered together and distributed uniformly. According to surveys, in the villages where cooperative farming societies were established, the members would go to work as soon as the ox horn or bugle was blown every day, and everyone was quick in action and full of energy. Regardless of whether they were male or female members, they all participated in militia training every morning and went to night school to study culture together in the evening. After the implementation of the cooperative farming society system, rural production developed greatly. In 1930, there was drought and little rain, but the land of the cooperative farming society still increased production by one-third compared with the previous year. In the past, poor peasants and farm laborers could not get enough food for nine months of the year and had to rely on selling firewood and thatch to make a living. With the good leadership of the Party and the cooperative farming society, there was more grain, and life was pretty good. How could this not make the members sing happily about the cooperative farming society!

Martyr Fang Zhimin's Last Letter

    "The enemy can only cut off our heads,
    But can never shake our faith!…
    Sacrificing for communism,
    Shedding blood for the Soviets,
    That is what we are willing to do!"

Many people have probably read Martyr Fang Zhimin's posthumous work "Imprisonment Notes," and the above-quoted heroic verses are written at the very beginning of this book. This exhibition displays a photocopy of part of the original manuscript of this book.

In recent years, following the publication of "Lovely China," "Imprisonment Notes" was published in 1957 based on part of the manuscripts of Martyr Fang Zhimin treasured by the archives department. Here, people once again saw the glorious image of an unyielding Communist. While in prison, Martyr Fang Zhimin was always prepared to sacrifice himself, but as long as he had a breath, no matter how he was confined in a smelly and stuffy prison, no matter how dangerous the environment, he was always upholding revolutionary justice and carrying out the most resolute struggle against the enemy. Many people have read the martyr's posthumous works with tears in their eyes, and with full of enthusiasm, they are determined to make themselves strong and sublime. These manuscripts of Martyr Fang Zhimin are being well preserved by the national archives department, and they will always radiate light and be passed down for thousands of years.

Thank the Party for its care

Here, people also saw a telegram approved by Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhu De. In the spring of 1947, the Hu Zongnan bandit army invaded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region with all its forces. After the Central Committee withdrew from Yan'an, Comrades Shaoqi and Zhu De made a decision to handle the central documents. The decision instructed Party organizations at all levels to properly preserve the documents, designated the relevant responsible persons of the central organs and the responsible persons of the Northwest Bureau to be responsible for preserving the central documents, and required Comrade He Long to be responsible for security. Seeing this telegram today in the construction of socialism, it feels very cordial. It encourages the archives workers of the new China to love their careers. It is precisely because the Party led the revolution to victory, and it is precisely because of the Party's care that the true records reflecting the Party's leadership of the revolution from victory to victory have been preserved.

    看珍藏
    ——全国档案资料工作展览会片断
        本报记者　汪波清
    展览会上珍藏多。这珍藏不是珠宝，但是它有珠宝无可比拟的光辉；珠宝闪闪夺目，而这珍藏却永远照亮着人心。这就是反映革命步伐的革命历史档案资料。
      “我们天下”
    “看，党对我们是多么关怀啊……。”在展览会综合馆第一幅展品面前，观众们不断发出各式各样感慨的声音。这里展示的是一件党中央在1931年规定的“文书处置办法”原稿的影印。稿子是瞿秋白同志亲笔写的。那时中国革命还是“星星之火”，但是稿子的字里行间却充溢着革命必胜的信心，包含着党对档案工作的无限关怀。“文书处置办法”最后有一个总注，说：“如可能，当然最理想的是每种两份，一份存阅，一分入库，备交将来之党史委员会。”在最后一句“将来”二字下面，瞿秋白同志特别划了个注解的括弧，里面写道：“我们天下”。烈士的遗笔鼓舞着新中国的后代，展览会上，许多观众在看完了展览会的三十二个馆以后，还舍不得离开，回头又来到第一幅展品前面，再仔细读上几遍。
    中华苏维埃共和国的布告
   “毛主席的名字在这里呢！”在江西馆，人们欣喜地看到了由毛主席签署的中华苏维埃共和国临时中央政府的第一号布告。布告向苦难重重的中国人民宣告：中华工农兵第一次全国代表大会于1931年11月在江西苏区开会，议决了政纲、土地法、劳动法，宣告中华苏维埃共和国成立。
    在这张二十八年前的布告前面，观众有的轻轻念着布告上临时中央政府委员的名字刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、瞿秋白、项英……。有的一起追叙第二次国内革命战争时期的往事，一个年轻的同志说：“那时我们多少人还没出生，可是党和毛主席对中华民族的命运早早就作好了安排，我们这一代太幸福啦！”
    这张两尺多长宽的布告还有这样一段可歌可泣的故事：这张布告当时收藏在江西苏区一位农村干部的手里，红军长征北上以后，这位干部被国民党反动派抓去了，他受尽严刑拷打，但是他还是设法把布告交给了儿媳妇，要她牢实保藏起来，准备迎接革命的胜利。江西解放后，这位继承了父翁意志的妇女找出布告，交给了政府。
      “共耕社”
    “谢土地执委，一切为群众。咱办共耕社，永远不受穷。”多么亲切的声音！这是那个年代的歌谣。“共耕社”又是什么？在展览会的广西馆里，一份保存得很好的广西右江苏维埃政府颁布的“共耕社条例”告诉了我们一切。
    1930年，广西右江苏维埃政府在分配土地的基础上，又领导一部分地区的人民办了共耕社。当时在东兰县、那伦县领导人民办共耕社的，就有中共中央特派员、中共广西前委书记邓小平同志。人们看到“共耕社条例”包括九个部分，有总则、土地管理、耕作、工具、肥料、农产物分配、建设、纪律和附则。共耕社的生产组，由组长领导生产，犁牛、耙犁等生产工具，按各组劳动力和土地多少统一调拨，收获的粮食集中在一起，统一分配。据调查，办起共耕社的村庄，每天牛角、洋号一吹，社员便出动上工，只见人人行动迅速，个个精神饱满。不论男女社员，每天早晨都参加民兵训练，晚上相伴到夜校学习文化。共耕社制度实行以后，农村生产大发展，1930年天旱少雨，但共耕社的土地仍较上一年增产三分之一。过去贫雇农一年里有九个月吃不上粮，不得不靠卖柴火茅草熬日子。有了党的好领导，有了共耕社，粮食多了，日子过得挺美气，这怎么能不使社员开怀歌唱共耕社呢！
  方志敏烈士的遗书
    “敌人只能砍下我们的头颅，
    决不能动摇我们的信仰！……
    为着共产主义牺牲
    为苏维埃流血，
    那是我们十分情愿的啊！”
    许多人大概都读过方志敏烈士的遗著“狱中纪实”，上面引的壮烈诗句就写在这本书的最前头。这次展览会展出了这本书部分原稿的影印。
    几年来，继出版了“可爱的中国”以后，1957年又根据档案部门珍藏的方志敏烈士的部分遗稿，出版了“狱中纪实”。人们从这里再一次看到了一个不屈不挠的共产党人的光辉形象。方志敏烈士在狱中时时准备牺牲自己，但是只要还有一口气，不管自己怎样关在熏臭闷热的监狱里，不管环境怎样险恶，他更是时时伸张革命正义，同敌人进行最坚决的斗争。许多人曾含着泪水读完烈士的遗著，满怀激情地决心使自己变得坚强而又崇高。方志敏烈士的这些遗稿正为国家档案部门很好地保存着，它将永远放射光辉，留传千秋。
    感谢党的关怀
    这里人们还看到了刘少奇同志和朱德同志批的一件电报。1947年春，胡宗南匪军倾巢进犯陕甘宁边区，中央在撤出延安后，少奇和朱德同志作出了处理中央文件的决定。决定中指示各级党组织必须妥善保管文件，指定中央机关的有关负责人和西北局的负责人负责保管中央文件，并且要求由贺龙同志担负安全保障之责。在建设社会主义的今天，看到这份电报，感到十分亲切。它鼓舞着新中国档案工作者热爱自己的事业。正是党领导革命取得了胜利，也正是由于党的关怀，才保存了反映党领导革命从胜利走向胜利的真实记录。
