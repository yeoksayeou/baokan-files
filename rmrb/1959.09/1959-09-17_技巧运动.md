Acrobatic gymnastics has a relatively broad mass base in our country. Folk activities like somersaults, handstands, cartwheels, as well as many tumbling and balancing movements in Peking opera and acrobatics, all possess high levels of acrobatic gymnastics technique. According to historical records and unearthed cultural relics, as early as the Qin and Han dynasties, the "Yanxi" was the prototype of acrobatic gymnastics. However, under the discrimination and devastation of more than two thousand years of feudal rule, many excellent movements and training methods have been lost.

After liberation, thanks to the attention and promotion of the Party and the state, this ancient sport has gained a new life.

Since 1956, our country has held three national acrobatic gymnastics championships. The number of athletes participating in the competition has increased year by year, the difficulty of the prescribed movements in each event has also increased year by year, and better results have been achieved. In particular, the somersault movements are high and fast, and the landing is silent, which has won high praise internationally. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has also formulated a set of high-standard compulsory movements for master-level athletes based on China's specific conditions and combined with national forms, which were used for the first time in this National Games competition.

Acrobatic gymnastics is an international competition event, including men's and women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles, and group (four-person) events. In the Soviet Union and Hungary, women's doubles events are also added, for a total of six events (women's doubles event is not being contested in this National Games). Athletes participating in each event are required to perform three sets of compulsory movements and three sets of optional movements, and also one set each of compulsory and optional free exercise movements. Each person must do free exercise, mainly to comprehensively develop the athlete's physical training, not only making the movements agile and powerful, but also coordinated and rhythmic.

Acrobatic gymnastics is a sport within gymnastics, but unlike gymnastics (except for free exercise), it does not require the use of equipment, but is performed freehand. Because this sport is not restricted by venues, equipment, and facilities, and is loved by the masses, it will be more widely developed in the future. (Image attached)

    技巧运动
    技巧运动在我国有相当广泛的群众基础，像民间的翻跟斗、拿大顶（倒立）、打车轮（侧手翻）以及京剧、杂技中许多翻腾和平衡动作，都具有很高的技巧运动技术水平。根据历史和出土文物的记载和考查，早在秦汉时期流行的“燕戏”就是技巧运动的雏形，可是在二千多年封建统治的歧视和摧残下，许多优良的动作和培养方法已都失传。
    解放后，由于党和国家的重视和提倡，才使这项古老的运动获得了新生命。
    从1956年以来，我国已举行过三次全国性的技巧运动锦标赛，参加比赛的运动员逐年增多，各个项目的规定动作的难度也逐年提高，并且出现了较好的成绩，特别是翻跟斗动作，翻得又高又快，落地无声，在国际上获得很高的评价。国家体委今年又根据我国具体情况，结合民族形式制定了一套要求较高的健将级规定动作，已在这次全运会比赛中首次采用。
    技巧运动是国际比赛项目，它包括男、女单人动作、男子双人动作、男女混合动作和团体（四人）动作，在苏联、匈牙利还增加有女子双人动作，一共六个项目（这次全运会女子双人动作不比赛）。参加每个项目的运动员都需做三套规定动作和三套自选动作，并且还要做自由操的规定和自选动作各一套。每人必须做自由操，主要是使运动员身体训练得到全面发展，不仅动作灵巧有力，而且协调、有韵律感。
    技巧运动是体操运动的一个项目，但是不像体操（自由操除外）需用器械进行，而是徒手进行的。由于这个项目不受场地、器材、设备的限制，又为广大群众喜爱，今后将会得到更加广泛的发展。（附图片）
