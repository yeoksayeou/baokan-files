	Forward, High-Speed Forward
	——Record of the Performance Competition of Anshan Iron and Steel's Five Large Fixed Open-Hearth Furnaces
	By Our Reporters Chang Gong and Gu Tiefeng
	A massive mass movement to overfulfill this year's steel and steel materials tasks is rapidly taking shape in Anshan.
	At the forefront of this movement are Anshan Iron and Steel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces—through the method of "performance competition," they have mobilized all their employees, becoming a model for all factories and mines in Anshan to learn from.
	Recently, we made a special trip to visit these five open-hearth furnaces.
	We were received by Party Secretary Liu Guohua and Deputy Secretary Lu Zheng. As soon as we sat down, a comrade brought the daily production progress report. When we saw it, we asked with concern:
	"Was the August plan completed?"
	"Exceeded by 11,300 tons."
	"How about July?"
	"July also exceeded by more than 10,000 tons." Secretary Liu said, "Since we launched the performance competition in May, production has been rising, with full success every month."
	Then, Secretary Liu made the following comparison of the production situation before and after the performance competition: Taking March, the best month before the performance competition, as 100, then the first month after the performance competition—May—increased by 8.06% compared to March, June increased by 1.5% compared to May, and July and August both overfulfilled the plan ahead of schedule. Utilization factor: March was 7.16, May was 7.58, June was 7.95, July was 8.7, and August created a new record, reaching 9.15. ...
	Hearing this, we asked them to talk about the performance competition.
	"This has to be talked about from the beginning." Secretary Liu began, "Our fixed open-hearth furnaces are the most advanced open-hearth furnaces in the world, with brand-new equipment and large volume. Without a certain level of technical skill, it is difficult to control them. However, most of our workers came from the countryside, and some veteran workers who had worked on tilting open-hearth furnaces had never seen such open-hearth furnaces. Therefore, since all of them were put into production last November, the situation has always been abnormal.
	"At that time, we thought of many ways, such as running Red and Expert Schools, organizing visits, etc. These methods were good, but they were too slow to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, nor could they meet the needs of the workers. Later, Soviet experts came and adopted the method of mutual performance to teach the workers. At first, the experts performed for the workers to watch, and when the workers learned, they performed for the experts to watch. In this way, in just a few days, the first few workers who learned could independently operate their positions.
	"At that time, after contacting various parties through the Party Committee, it was decided to first demonstrate opening the tap hole. We chose to demonstrate this project for two reasons: first, it is a key to production. If each time can be advanced by a few minutes, the country can produce many more tons of steel. Second, the workers have not fully mastered this technology. Generally, it takes four or five hours, and once it even took thirteen hours. However, some individual workers are very fast, only taking a little over an hour each time, and some even only take twenty or thirty minutes. If each furnace can be shortened to this time, wouldn't it be able to produce more steel? Besides, every worker also hopes to shorten the time as much as possible, but they just haven't found a reasonable and effective way. So, we chose Feng Zhitai, the first assistant of No. 3 furnace, who was relatively quick at opening the tap hole, to perform."
	"This performance caused a huge shock." "Everyone saw that the performance was not mysterious. Whoever does what can perform. At the same time, a lot can be learned from the performance, and one's own skills can be improved. At that time, the first assistants of several furnaces all ran to the loudspeaker room to request that they also be broadcast performing."
	"Our performance competition started from this time." Secretary Liu continued, "In order to develop this movement in a broad and in-depth direction, our Party Committee immediately put forward the slogan of 'Everyone performs, everything performs, every shift performs.' Then, after the performance competition started in various work sections, we put forward slogans such as 'Proficient in one's profession, come from a professional background,' 'Strive to reach the first-class level in one's profession,' and 'Become a small expert in one's position.' A mass movement of individual-to-individual, group-to-group, shift-to-shift, furnace-to-furnace, and work section-to-work section single, joint, and large-scale performance competitions quickly formed."
	"Not only production workers are like this." Deputy Secretary Lu added, "Even the office staff, cooks, and odd-job personnel, who were not easily mobilized in past competitions, are now also performing and competing with each other."
	"This is a situation we did not expect." Secretary Lu said, "Our performance competition was proposed to solve technical problems, but we didn't expect it to become a major competition of thought, production, and technology."
	"Why is the performance competition developing so vigorously?" Secretary Liu asked rhetorically, and then continued, "Now it seems that the performance competition fully reflects the urgent demands and common aspirations of the broad masses of workers in continuing the Great Leap Forward. First of all, this kind of competition is carried out through specific operations and specific work performances. In fact, it is also an image-based method of on-site observation and personal demonstration, combining production and learning, mutual teaching and mutual learning, and learning from each other's strengths and making up for one's weaknesses. Therefore, it is most suitable for the level of the masses and is most accepted by the masses. Secondly, this kind of competition is also a competition that fully exerts subjective initiative and combines hard work, practical work, and skillful work. This is because each performance is proposed by the performer himself. Before the performance, preparations must be made, and after the performance, evaluations must be made. In this way, everyone has to use their brains and think of ways. Therefore, the more they compete, the more motivated they are, and the more they compete, the greater their interest. ..."
	"Precisely because of this," Secretary Liu continued, "the production level of our five large fixed open-hearth furnaces has completely stepped onto a new stage. From a technical point of view, it has generally improved a step. According to statistics from the open-hearth furnace, ingot casting, and furnace repair work sections, since the performance competition, among 1,016 people, 671 people have gone from unskilled to skilled, 181 people are close to being promoted to a higher grade, 116 people have been promoted to a higher grade, and 48 people have been promoted to foreman, furnace chief, etc."
	Hearing this, we were happy for the great achievements of this performance competition and even more proud of the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. When we walked out of the Party Committee office with this feeling, we looked up and saw a stimulating slogan appearing in front of us on the wall, which read:
	"Fight to win the overproduction of 70,000 tons of high-quality steel this year!"
	This is an even greater Great Leap Forward plan. We wish them victory, and we believe they will definitely win.

    前进，高速度前进
    ——记鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉的表演竞赛
    本报记者　常工　顾铁风
    一个声势浩大的为超额完成今年钢铁和钢材任务的群众运动，正在鞍山迅速形成。
    站在这个运动前列的是鞍钢的五座大型固定式平炉——他们通过“表演竞赛”的方法，已把全部职工都动员了起来，成为鞍山各厂矿学习的榜样。
    最近，我们特地前去访问了这五座平炉。
    接见我们的是党委书记刘国华和副书记路政。刚刚让我们坐下来，有个同志就送来了每日生产进度表。我们一看，就关心地问道：
    “8月份完成计划了吗？”
    “超额一万一千三百吨。”
    “7月呢？”
    “7月也是超额一万多吨。”刘书记说：“从5月我们开展表演竞赛以来，生产一直上升，月月满堂红。”
    接着，刘书记就把表演竞赛前后生产情况作了如下的对比：表演竞赛前以3月为最好，如其产量为一百，那么，表演竞赛以后的第一个月——5月，就比3月提高了8.06％，6月又比5月提高1.5％，7、8两月都提前超额完成了计划。利用系数：3月为七点一六，5月为七点五八，6月为七点九五，7月为八点七，8月更创造了新纪录，达到九点一五。……
    听到这里，我们就请他们讲讲表演竞赛。
    “这可得从头谈起。”刘书记开始说了：“我们的固定式平炉是世界上最先进的平炉，设备全新，容积很大，没有一定的技术水平，是很难控制它的。但是，我们的工人大多数是从农村来的，有些在倾动式平炉上干过的老工人，也没见过这样的平炉。因此，从去年11月全部投入生产以来，情况总是不正常。
    “当时，我们曾想了很多的办法，例如，办红专学校，组织参观访问，等等，这些办法好是好，就是太慢，不能适应生产跃进的形势，也不能满足职工的需要，后来，苏联专家来了，采取相互表演的办法来教工人。开始，专家先表演给工人看，等工人看会了，然后再表演给专家看。这样，没过上几天，最早学习的几个工人就能在自己的岗位上独立操作了。
    “当时，经过党委会与各方面的联系，就确定首先表演打开出钢口。我们选择表演这个项目有两个原因，一是这是个生产关键，如果每次都能提前几分钟，就能给国家多产好多吨钢。一是工人还没有完全掌握这项技术，一般都得四、五个钟头，有次还达到了十三个钟头，但是，有些个别工人却很快，每次只有点把钟就行了，甚至有的只要二、三十分钟就行了。如果每炉都能缩短到这个时间，不是就能出更多的钢吗？再说每个工人也都是希望能够尽量缩短时间的，只是没有找到合理、有效的办法罢了。于是，我们就选择了打开出钢口比较快的三号炉的一助手冯志泰来表演。”
    “这次表演震动大极了。”“大家看表演并不神秘，谁干什么，谁就能表演，同时，从表演中可以学习很多东西，可以提高自己的技术。当时，有好几个炉子的一助手，就都纷纷地跑到扩音室去，要求广播他们也要表演。”
    “我们的表演竞赛就从这时开始了。”刘书记继续说下去：“为了使这个运动向着广泛、深入的方向发展，我们党委会就在这时，立即提出了‘人人表演，事事表演，班班表演’的口号，接着表演竞赛在各个工段开始后，我们又提出了‘精通本行，科班出身’‘争取达到本行的第一流水平’和‘成为本岗位的小专家’等等口号。一个个人与个人、组与组、班与班、炉与炉、工段与工段之间的单项的、联合的、声势浩大的表演竞赛的群众运动就迅速地形成了。”
    “不仅生产工人如此。”路副书记补充了一句：“连过去多次竞赛也不容易动员起来的科室人员、炊事人员和勤杂人员等，现在也都相互表演竞赛了。”
    “这是我们没有预料到的形势。”路书记说：“我们表演竞赛是为解决技术问题才提出来，没有想到竟变成了思想、生产、技术的大竞赛。”
    “为什么表演竞赛会这样蓬勃的发展呢？”刘书记反问了一下，接着就又说下去：“现在看来，就是表演竞赛是充分地反映了广大职工群众在继续跃进中的迫切要求和共同愿望。首先，这种竞赛是通过具体操作和具体工作的表演进行的，实际上也就是采取实地观摩现身说法的形象化的方法，把生产和学习结合在一起进行的，互教互学，取长补短，因此，它就最适合群众的水平，也最为群众所接受。其次，这种竞赛又是充分发挥主观能动性，把苦干、实干与巧干相结合起来的竞赛，这是因为每项表演都是表演者自己提出来的，表演前，要作准备，表演后，要作评比，这样大家都得动脑筋，想办法，因此，越赛越有劲，越赛兴趣越大。……”
    “正是由于这样，”刘书记继续说下去：“我们五座固定式大平炉的生产水平，就完全跨上了一个新阶段。从技术水平来看，已经普遍的提高了一步。据平炉、铸锭和修炉三个工段统计，表演竞赛以来，一千零十六个人中，已有六百七十一人由不熟练达到熟练，有一百八十一人接近提高一级，有一百一十六人提高一级，有四十八人还被提为工长、炉长等。
    听到这里，我们为这个表演竞赛的伟大成就感到高兴，更为广大职工的冲天干劲感到骄傲。当我们怀着这种心情走出党委会办公室的时候，抬头一看，前面墙上一幅振奋人心的标语出现在眼前，上面写着：
    “为争取今年超产七万吨优质钢而战！”
    这是一个更为伟大的跃进计划。我们预祝他们胜利，我们相信他们一定会胜利。
