    The Chicken's "Digestion Pill"
	Ai Lin
    Chickens eat a wide variety of foods, such as grains, vegetables, bone meal, small insects, and the tender leaves of wild plants. However, we often see chickens swallowing sand and stones. When a chicken is killed, many sand and stones can also be found in its stomach. What nutritional value can sand and stones have for chickens? If they have no nutritional value, why do chickens swallow them?
    In the past, we often heard older people say that chickens have no teeth, but chickens have a "digestion pill" in their stomachs. Anything that a chicken eats is crushed and digested when it meets this "digestion pill." In reality, it is not a "digestion pill," but sand and stones.
    Chickens have three digestive sacs. The first is called the crop, which grows below the neck. The crop's skin is thin and soft, but very tough and elastic. The food that the chicken swallows stays in this crop for several hours, or even days, not for any other reason than to absorb some moisture or a small amount of digestive juice, becoming softer. Then, it comes to the other two digestive sacs in portions.
    The chicken's second digestive sac is very small, but extremely important, because it can secrete a liquid with a sour taste—digestive juice—which can dissolve food. Food does not stay in the second digestive sac; it simply passes through to obtain digestive juice.
    The chicken's third digestive sac is called the gizzard, which is round and flat on both sides, like a box. The sac's skin is thicker, and the surface is hard and strong. The sand and stones that the chicken swallows perform the function of teeth here. After the food softens in the crop and absorbs digestive juice in the second digestive sac, it comes to the gizzard and mixes with the sand and stones. The walls of the gizzard contract, causing the food to be ground into powder by the friction of the sand. The gizzard is like a flour mill.
    How great is the grinding ability of the gizzard? It is better than our teeth and the teeth of all animals. A hundred years ago, an Italian scholar, Spallanzani, conducted an experiment. He fed chickens some glass balls. Three hours later, he examined the chicken's feces, and the glass balls had become fragments. These fragments had no sharp corners or piercing edges, as if someone had polished them, and were very smooth. Later, he inserted twelve thick steel needles into a lead ball, with only half a centimeter of the needles' tips exposed, and let a chicken swallow it. A day and a half later, he killed the chicken and examined it. The digestive sac was not damaged in the slightest, and all the steel needles were broken. Only two remained inside, having been ground very blunt. The other ten had been excreted with the feces.
    It seems that the chicken's "digestion pill"—the sand and stones in the gizzard—can not only "digest" food, but also "digest" steel!

### 鸡的“化食丹”

    鸡的“化食丹”
  　爱林
    鸡的食物很广，如：谷物、蔬菜、骨粉、小昆虫、野生植物的嫩叶等。但我们也常看到鸡吞食沙石，杀鸡时，从鸡的胃里，也能发现许多沙石。沙石对鸡能有什么营养呢？若是没有什么营养价值，鸡为什么吞食它呢？
    过去我们常听见一些老年人说，鸡没有牙齿，但是鸡肚子里有“化食丹”，吃的东西一遇到这“化食丹”便粉碎了，消化了。其实并不是什么“化食丹”，而是沙石。
    鸡有三个消化囊。第一个叫膆囊，长在脖子的下面，囊皮薄而软，却十分坚韧，富有伸缩能力。鸡吞进的食物，在这个膆囊里要停留几小时，以至几天，并非为了别的，只是在这里吸收一些水分或少量消化液，变得柔软一些，然后，便一部分一部分地来到另外那两个消化囊。
    鸡的第二个消化囊很小，却极其重要，因为能分泌出具有酸味的液体——消化液，可以溶化食物。食物在第二个消化囊里并不停留，只是为了得到消化液，从这经过一下而已。
    鸡的第三个消化囊叫作沙囊，圆形、两面扁平，仿佛一个盒子，囊皮较厚，表面坚硬而强韧。鸡吞食的沙石，就在这里执行着牙齿的职能。食物在膆囊中变软以后，又在第二个消化囊吸收了消化液，再来到沙囊和沙石混合到一起。沙囊的四壁通过伸缩作用，使食物因受沙子的摩擦而变成粉末。沙囊就好像磨粉机一样。
    沙囊的研磨能力，究竟有多大？它比我们的牙齿以及所有动物的牙齿都好使。百年以前，一位意大利学者斯巴拉萨尼曾作过试验。他让鸡吃下一些玻璃球，三个小时以后，他检查鸡的粪便，玻璃球已变成碎片，这些碎片，没有尖角和刺人的边，就像有人把他们磨过一样，非常光滑。后来，他又把十二只粗钢针插在一个铅球里面，钢针的尖端只露出半糎，又让一只鸡吞下去。一天半以后，把这鸡杀死一看，消化囊没受丝毫损伤，所有的钢针都断了，只有两只留在里面，已磨得很钝，其他十只都先后随着粪便排出体外了。
    看来，鸡的“化食丹”——沙囊里的沙石，不仅可以“化”食，还能“化”钢铁呢！
