Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 22nd. The mass movement of Great Leap Forward in Steel production has ended the history of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region having no iron and steel industry. Of the indigenous steel and iron produced in the region, besides supplying 50,000 tons of good iron to Shanghai for steelmaking, incomplete statistics from the commercial departments of Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Wuzhou cities, and twenty counties, show that over 2,062 tons were used in the processing of hardware tools and agricultural implements in the first half of this year alone. From July to the present, the Autonomous Region's Department of Commerce has allocated another 5,680 tons of indigenous steel and iron for manufacturing agricultural implements and small hardware.

Many county-level machinery factories are also using indigenous steel and iron to manufacture lathes and other simple machines, arming both themselves and the communes' small factories. Industrial enterprises in the Yulin area used indigenous steel and iron to produce 1,220 units of gas engines, metal-cutting machine tools, mining equipment, and small sugar presses last year and in the first half of this year. The Shilong County industrial sector used indigenous steel to produce twelve small lathes, 146 vine cutting machines, and three ore crushers, which were supplied to the small factories of various communes.

    广西土钢土铁造机械
    据新华社南宁22日电　大炼钢铁的群众运动，使广西僮族自治区结束了没有钢铁工业的历史。全区生产的土钢土铁，除了以五万吨好铁供给上海炼钢以外，据南宁、柳州、桂林、梧州四个市及二十个县的商业部门的不完全统计，仅今年上半年在五金工具和农具的加工上就用了二千零六十二吨。7月到现在，自治区商业厅又拨出五千六百八十吨土钢土铁用来制造农具和小五金。
    许多县的机械工厂还利用土钢土铁制造车床和其他简易机器，既武装自己，又武装了公社的小型工厂。玉林专区的工业企业，去年和今年上半年用土钢土铁生产煤汽机、金属切削机床、矿山设备、小型榨糖机等共达一千二百二十台。石龙县工业部门利用土钢生产了十二台小车床、一百四十六部切蔓机、三台碎矿机，供给了各公社的小工厂。
