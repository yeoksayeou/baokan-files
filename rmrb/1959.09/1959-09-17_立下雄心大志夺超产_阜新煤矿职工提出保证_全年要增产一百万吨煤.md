    Setting Lofty Ambitions to Seize Overproduction
    Fuxin Coal Mine Workers Propose Guarantee
    To Increase Coal Production by One Million Tons Throughout the Year
    Xinhua News Agency report: Fuxin Coal Mine workers have proposed a guarantee: to complete the annual state plan 18 days ahead of schedule this year and to increase coal production for the country by one million tons throughout the year.
    Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Fuxin Coal Mine has vigorously launched mass movements, and the coal output in the first eight months has increased by 40.6% compared with the same period last year. In August, Fuxin area experienced fourteen days of heavy rain, forcing four open-pit mines to suspend production for a time. However, the workers tried every possible means to overcome the heavy rain, enabling these mines to quickly resume production, and at the same time took measures to increase the output of the working faces. As a result, they still overfulfilled the monthly production plan, producing nearly 100,000 tons of coal more than in July. Entering September, the workers also reversed the situation of "slack at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month" in production, and completed the production plan for the first ten days more than 30,000 tons ahead of schedule.
    Fuxin Coal Mine also pays great attention to promoting advanced experience. The thirty-six advanced experiences that the Ministry of Coal Industry stipulates for promotion have been promoted in combination with the actual situation for the most part. Due to the improvement of production preparation work, the recoverable coal volume of the coal mine had reached 4.98 million tons by the end of August, which can basically meet the needs of continued leap forward in production. The production cost of raw coal has also been reduced compared with last year.
    Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Launches Red Flag Competition
    Fully Overfulfilled the First Ten Days of the Plan
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has fully overfulfilled the plan for loading, freight volume, unloading, freight car stay and turnaround time in the first ten days of September. The freight volume increased by 35% compared with the first ten days of August.
    Entering September, the workers of all sections and stations of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau launched a vigorous red flag train competition movement. On September 5, the bureau dispatched 332 red flag trains, creating the latest record of turnaround and transfer time in the history of the bureau. Leading cadres of all sections and stations also loaded and unloaded with the workers, and jointly studied and improved their work, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers. Some stations also implemented clever loading and full loading, and light and heavy loading methods, which greatly improved transportation efficiency.
    Shanghai Scientific Chemical Factory Technological Revolution
    Determined to Complete the Third Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The workers of Shanghai Scientific Chemical Factory, the largest medical thermometer manufacturer in the country, are determined to realize fifteen important technological innovation projects and complete the third quarter production plan five days ahead of schedule to present a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    Since last year, the workers of Shanghai Scientific Chemical Factory have vigorously carried out technological innovation movements. So far, the factory has realized more than 270 technological innovation projects, reducing the seventy-nine processes for manufacturing thermometers by fifteen. There have been major reforms in processes such as filling mercury, inverting air, and shrinking the throat. For example, in the past, mercury was poured by installing a small funnel at the seal of each thermometer to heat and sink the mercury, which was relatively inefficient. After the workers adopted the high-vacuum air compression method for injection, the efficiency was increased by fifteen times. Due to these measures, not only has the output of thermometers greatly increased, but the cost has also been reduced by half compared with 1957. (Attached picture)

    立下雄心大志夺超产
    阜新煤矿职工提出保证
    全年要增产一百万吨煤
    新华社讯　阜新煤矿职工提出保证：今年要提前十八天完成全年国家计划，全年要为国家增产一百万吨煤。
    今年以来，阜新煤矿在中共阜新市委的领导下大搞群众运动，头八个月的煤炭产量比去年同期增长了40.6％。8月份，阜新地区下了十四天大雨，迫使四个露天矿一度停产。但是职工们千方百计地战胜大雨，使这些矿迅速恢复生产，同时采取措施增加工作面的产量，结果仍然超额完成了当月的生产计划，比7月份还多产近十万吨煤。进入9月，职工们又扭转了生产上“月初松、月末紧”的局面，提前一天超额三万多吨完成了上旬生产计划。
    阜新煤矿还很注意推广先进经验。煤炭工业部规定推广的三十六项先进经验，绝大部分都结合实际情况推广了。由于改进了生产准备工作，这个煤矿到8月底的可采获得煤量已经达到四百九十八万吨，基本上能满足生产继续跃进的需要。原煤生产成本也比去年降低。
    郑州铁路局掀起红旗竞赛
    全面超额完成了上旬计划
    据新华社讯　郑州铁路局全面超额完成9月上旬的装车、货运量、卸车、货车停留和周转时间计划。货运量比8月上旬增长了35％。
    进入9月份，郑州铁路局各段、站职工掀起了轰轰烈烈的红旗列车竞赛运动。9月5日，全局就开出红旗列车三百三十二列，创造了全局历年来周转、中转时间的最新纪录。各段、站的领导干部也同职工一起装卸，一起研究改进工作，大大鼓舞了职工的干劲。有些车站还实行了巧装满载、轻重配装的办法，大大提高了运输的效率。
    上海科学化工厂技术大革新
    决心提前完成第三季度计划
    据新华社讯　全国最大的医用体温表制造厂——上海科学化工厂职工，决心实现十五项重要技术革新项目，提前五天完成第三季度生产计划，向国庆十周年献礼。
    从去年开始，上海科学化工厂职工就大力开展技术革新运动，到目前为止，全厂已经实现二百七十多条技术革新项目，使制造体温表的七十九道工序减少了十五道；灌水银、倒空气、缩喉等工序都有重大改革。如过去灌水银是在每一支体温表封口处装一个小漏斗加热沉漏水银，效率比较低。职工们采用高真空空气压缩法灌注后，将效率提高了十五倍。由于采取了这些措施，不仅体温表的产量大大提高，成本也比1957年降低了一半。（附图片）
