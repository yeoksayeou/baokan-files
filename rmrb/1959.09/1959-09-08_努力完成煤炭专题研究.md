    Strive to Complete Coal Special Research
    Xuē Qiān, Deputy Director of the Mining Research Institute of the Beijing Coal Science Research Institute
    After studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, I received another profound education, which increased my unparalleled strength. I resolutely respond to the Party's call with practical actions.
    In order to complete this year's scientific research projects ahead of schedule, after repeated discussions among all members of the institute, we put forward the following specific measures:
    1. Ensure the timely completion of the annual special plans with guaranteed quality and quantity, and complete eleven major special projects an average of one and a half months ahead of schedule.
    2. Complete five special topics, such as the industrial test report of wind power lifting, before "October 1st." In addition, complete forty-two research projects in thirty-nine special topics.
    3. Further tap potential and add five major research contents such as ultrasonic detectors.
    4. Budget carefully and practice diligence and thrift. Save another 41,000 yuan from the research funds after implementation, accounting for 20.6% of the total budget.
    At present, the people of the whole country are advancing bravely with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas. I am determined to overcome right-leaning thoughts and, together with all comrades in the institute, under the leadership of the Party committee of the institute, muster greater efforts and contribute all my energy to the Party's scientific research cause.

    努力完成煤炭专题研究
    北京煤炭科学研究院开采研究所副所长　薛谦
    学习了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议以后，我又受到了一次深刻的教育，从而增加了无可比拟的力量。我坚决用实际行动响应党的号召。
    为了提前完成今年的科学研究项目，经过全所同志反复讨论，我们提出以下具体措施。
    1、保证按时保质保量完成全年的专题计划，并要平均提前一个半月完成十一个重大专题项目。
    2、在“十、一”前完成风力提升工业性试验报告等五个专题。此外，还完成三十九个专题中的四十二项研究项目。
    3、进一步挖掘潜力，增加超声波探测仪等五项重大研究内容。
    4、精打细算，克勤克俭，在落实后的研究费用中，再节约四万一千元，占全部预算的20.6％。
    目前，全国人民正以移山倒海的气魄，勇猛前进，我坚决克服右倾思想，和全院同志一起，在院党委的领导下，鼓起更大的干劲，把一切精力贡献给党的科学研究事业。
