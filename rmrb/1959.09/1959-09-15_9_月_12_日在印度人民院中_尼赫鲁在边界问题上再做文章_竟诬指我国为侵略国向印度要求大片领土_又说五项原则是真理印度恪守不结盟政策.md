Xinhua News Agency, September 14th Dispatch: According to the Indian Information Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered another speech on the Sino-Indian border issue in the Lok Sabha (Lower House) on September 12th before the recess.

In his speech, Nehru reiterated his insistence on the so-called "McMahon Line." He said that this line "is very clear in many places, and in some places, it is not marked, and you must determine it based on other markers. The general practice of those who drew that line was to believe that it should pass through the watershed, which is a good practice, but we deliberately deviated from the watershed in one or two places. Therefore, when I say that I insist on the McMahon Line, I mean that I insist on that general practice. But if, based on evidence or facts—no matter what—it is necessary to make the boundary deviate slightly, this is not a big deal, and this must be determined by facts, not by anyone's coercion."

Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of reply on September 8, Nehru said that the letter raised many questions. He said, "Naturally, we must reply to it after full consideration, rather than hastily. It is currently being considered in this way." He added, "Premier Zhou Enlai's recent letter is worded more moderately in some parts, and in some parts he talks about maintaining the status quo, talks about negotiations, etc., but basically, that letter raises some very serious questions, which are being formally raised in this way almost for the first time."

Nehru also talked about the discussions being held by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing. He said, "There, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke largely in accordance with the direction of this letter, and others also spoke. Of course, you don't need to be particularly clever to know that everyone is speaking in the same direction, supporting Premier Zhou Enlai, expressing their surprise at finding that Nehru is actually defending British imperialism, asking Nehru, whom he is representing when he defends British imperialism, and whether it is in accordance with the Five Principles advocated by Nehru that Nehru and the Indian government now regard the aggressive conspiracy of British imperialism against China in the last century as an accomplished fact, and so on. There was a lot of talk like this, just like many members of parliament said some tough things about the McMahon Line, saying that they would insist on this line, not give an inch, etc. I forget who said it, but I seem to have seen such words somewhere, where they are equally strongly opposed to the McMahon Line. That's the situation."

He said, "Obviously, problems like this cannot be solved by resolutions passed in Delhi and Beijing, nor can they be solved by confronting each other with tough language. Other methods must be found, either peaceful methods or war methods. Every sensible person here and elsewhere hopes to avoid war for this problem or any problem. It is very clear that the most powerful countries in the world today are doing their best to find ways other than war. In this case, it seems quite ridiculous for us to consider and talk about war."

Nehru said, "What is happening in China today? I say this, I don't want to use strong words, but this is a pride and arrogance of being strong, which is manifested in their words, in their behavior towards us, and in many things they do. That's what it is." He continued, "This is not a question of one mile of land on this side of the McMahon Line or one mile of land on that side; I say again, these are small things. But another thing is not a small thing: they have drawn large areas of Indian territory on their maps and said that it is Chinese territory."

Nehru also said that the "sovereignty claims raised in Chinese maps" have been "more clearly specified for the first time" in Premier Zhou Enlai's recent letter and in the speech at the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress. He said, "In my opinion, this kind of handling or behavior is indeed a very inappropriate—if I can use this word—approach by one country towards another, especially towards a country that has always been friendly. That is the problem." He added, "The problem is—I repeat once again—don't worry about these small places. Small places are also important if even an inch of our territory is taken by means of coercion and aggression. Because what matters is not an inch of territory, but the means of coercion; because whether a few inches of territory in the mountains are on that side or not is irrelevant to China or India; but if we or they take insulting, aggressive, offensive, and violent measures to do this, then it is no small matter. That is what matters."

Nehru said, "Mediation, conciliation, and arbitration are impossible regarding the Chinese demands for large tracts of territory. It is absurd and ridiculous to base their demands on what happened in past centuries.” Nehru then reiterated his statement made in the Council of States on the 10th that "China was built by conquest," saying, "In the past, it (China) built itself by conquest, obviously, all its parts were like that, whether it was a few years ago, a hundred years, two hundred years, or five hundred years ago. It was built by conquest, like all great powers were built by conquest, violent conquest. If you apply this theory, China was not born complete when civilization began, so the argument about British imperialism can be refuted by the past—if not the present—Chinese imperialism."

Nehru said that the basic fact is that this Chinese demand, vaguely raised on maps etc., is now being stated more clearly. This is a demand that India and almost any Indian cannot recognize, no matter what the consequences. This is very clear. There is no question of mediation, conciliation, or arbitration on this point, because that is absurd, as someone—I think it was Mr. Khadilkar (an independent member of parliament—editor's note)—said, this involves fundamentally changing its entire geography; giving the Himalayas as a gift to them. This is an extraordinary demand. This matter cannot be agreed to whether India exists or not. That is the situation.”

Nehru said that, as far as he knew, "there are no Chinese troops anywhere on this side of the McMahon Line, except for a small detachment three miles, or perhaps four miles, from Longju. There is a small force there, and people seem to have the impression that large numbers of Chinese troops are stationed on the border or are pouring into the border. This impression is incorrect." He said, "We must realize that the real danger at present is not that troops are pouring in. The real danger lies in the words that Beijing is saying." He also said, "Today, we must face a great power, an aggressive power, whether you subtract communism or add communism, it may always be aggressive. It may be so, this is a fact you must face."

Nehru talked about the agreement signed by China and India in 1954 regarding trade and traffic between the Tibet region of China and India, which mentioned some mountain passes for pilgrims and others to pass through. He believed that "these mountain passes themselves define the boundary in a certain sense, and now the demand for Shipki La, here and there, as in the letter, is undoubtedly a violation of the 1954 agreement in terms of the mountain pass." He also said that the Tibetan local authorities had been "consistently rude" to the Indian mission and trade agencies in Tibet.

Nehru also disagreed with the point made in Premier Zhou Enlai's letter that the issue of the border between China and Sikkim was not within the scope of the current discussion. He said, "This issue is indeed entirely within the scope of our current or future discussions. We do not agree if he thinks he can handle this issue as an issue unrelated to India. We have publicly and justly undertaken several responsibilities, namely that if Sikkim and Bhutan are attacked, we will defend them, so it is very necessary for us to understand the situation there, because if something happens on their borders, it is equivalent to invading the Indian border." In response to a question, he said, "As far as I know, (the territory of Bhutan) has not been invaded."

In his speech, Nehru admitted that shortly after India's independence, the Indian government received a telegram from the Tibetan local government demanding that India return the territory on the Indo-Tibetan border. But he said that during British rule, India and Tibet had disputes over some small areas, "maybe this telegram referred to these disputed areas, smaller areas."

Nehru said, "We should not lead this major dispute between China and India, two great powers, down the wrong path. It would be completely wrong for us to do so. We must maintain our dignity and handle this situation as firmly as possible."

Nehru also talked about the Dalai Lama, saying, "The Indian people have great respect for the Dalai Lama, but at the same time, we have indeed told him many times that he should not make India a place for carrying out activities against a friendly country—I hope to say that. Generally speaking, for quite a long time, given the pressure and tension he has been under, it can be said that he has been very restrained. But sometimes he has gone beyond this, and we have had to refute some of his remarks. We do not want to have trouble in this regard, but because some of his remarks seemed too excessive to us, we had to refute them."

In his speech, Nehru also expressed his disapproval of the suggestion made by some members of parliament that the Indian government seek help from others. He said, "We adhere to our non-aligned policy." He believed that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are "self-evident truths." He said, "What we cannot accept, recognize, or agree to is precisely the extraordinary things and the words I quoted. This is the basic attitude. Everything can be discussed, can be compromised, can be done this way or that way, just like dealing with any country. Our general attitude has always been a friendly attitude, and even taking a friendly attitude as much as possible or from beginning to end, because according to our thinking, any other attitude is wrong."

He also disagreed with the opinion put forward by MP K. Singh requesting the Indian government to send planes to bomb Longju and other places.

    9月12日在印度人民院中
    尼赫鲁在边界问题上再做文章
    竟诬指我国为侵略国向印度要求大片领土
    又说五项原则是真理印度恪守不结盟政策
    据新华社14日讯　据印度新闻处报道：印度总理尼赫鲁12日在人民院（下院）休会以前又一次就中印边界问题发表了讲话。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中重申，他坚持所谓的“麦克马洪线”。他说，这条线“在许多地方是十分明确的，在有些地方，它没有标出来，你必须根据其它标记来定。划那条线的人的总的做法是认为应当通过分水岭，这是一种好的做法，但是我们在一两个地方故意离开分水岭。因此，当我说我坚持麦克马洪线的时候，我的意思是说，我坚持那种总的做法。但是如果根据证据或者事实——不管根据什么——有必要使界线稍微偏一些，这不是大事情，这必须由事实来决定，而不是由任何人的高压手段来决定。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到周恩来总理9月8日的复信时说，这封信提出了许多问题。他说，“自然，我们必须经过充分考虑以后答复它，而不是仓卒地答复它。目前正在对它进行这种考虑。”他又说，“周恩来总理最近寄来的信在某些部分措辞是比较温和的，在某些部分他谈到维持现状，谈到谈判等等，但是从基本上说，那封信提出了一些非常严重的问题，这些问题几乎是第一次以这种方式正式提出的。”
    尼赫鲁还谈到北京正在举行的人民代表大会常委会的讨论情况。他说，“在那里，周恩来总理大体上就是按照这封信的方针讲话的，其他的人也发了言，当然，不需要有什么特别的聪明就可以知道，每人都是按照同样的方针讲话的，支持周恩来总理，即表示他们十分惊讶，发现尼赫鲁竟为英帝国主义辩护云云，问尼赫鲁，他为英帝国主义辩护是代表谁讲话，现在尼赫鲁总理和印度政府把英帝国主义在上世纪对中国的侵略阴谋当作既成事实看待，这是否符合尼赫鲁所主张的五项原则，如此等等，这种话谈得很多，就像许多议员先生就麦克马洪线说了一些强硬的话一样，他们说，坚持这条线，寸步不让等等。我忘了是谁说的，但是，我似乎在什么地方看到这种话，在那里，他们同样强烈地反对麦克马洪线。情况就是这样。”
    他说，“显然，像这样的问题不能用在德里和在北京通过的决议来解决，也不能用相互以强硬的语言相对待来解决。必须找到其他的办法，不是和平的方法，就是战争的方法。这里和其他地方的每一个通情达理的人都希望避免为了这种问题或任何问题进行战争。十分清楚，世界上最强大的国家今天正在尽它们的最大力量寻找战争以外的办法，在这种情况下，我们来考虑和谈论战争，看来是相当可笑的。”
    尼赫鲁说，“今天中国正在出现怎样的情况呢？我这样说，我并不希望用激烈的字眼，但是，这就是在他们的言词中、他们对待我们的行为中、以及他们所做的许多事情中表现出来的一种自恃有力量的骄傲和傲慢态度。就是这么一回事。”他接着说，“这不是麦克马洪线这一边这一英里土地或者那一边那一英里土地的问题，我再说一遍，这些是小事情。但是，另外一件事情就不是小事情了：他们在他们的地图上画着大块印度领土，并且把它说成是中国的领土。”
    尼赫鲁又说，“中国地图中提出的主权要求”，在周恩来总理最近的这封信中和现在在中国人大常委会上的发言中“已经第一次更加明确地具体化了”。他说，“在我看来，这种处理办法或者行为的确是一个国家对待另一个国家的十分不适当的——如果我可以用这个字眼的话——做法，特别是对待一向友好的国家就更其是如此了。发生的问题就在于此。”他又说，“问题是——我再次重复一次——不要为这些小地方而烦恼。如果用高压和侵犯的手段甚至只取走我们的一码领土，小地方也是重要的。因为要紧的不是一码领土，而是高压手段；因为，不论在山区的几码领土是不是在那一边，这对中国或印度来说都无关紧要；可是，如果是我们或者他们采取侮辱的、侵犯的、进攻的、激烈的方式来做到这一点的话，那就非同小可了。要紧的是这一点。”
    尼赫鲁说，“关于中国人对于大片领土的要求，是不可能进行调停、调解和仲裁的。以过去几世纪发生的事情作为他们的要求的基础，那是十分荒诞和荒谬的。尼赫鲁接着又一次提出他曾经在10日在联邦院中谈过的“中国是靠征服建立起来的”这种说法，他说，“在过去，它（中国）是靠征服把自己建立起来的，显然，它的所有部分都是这样，不论是在几年以前，一百年、两百年或五百年前。它是用征服建立起来的，像所有的大国是用征服、暴力的征服建立起来一样。如果你运用这种理论，当文明开始时，中国并不是生来就是完整的，因此，关于英帝国主义的论点很可以用过去的——如果不是目前的——中国帝国主义来加以反驳。”
    尼赫鲁说，基本事实是：在地图等等上面模糊地提出来的中国这一要求现在被更加明确地申述了。这个要求是印度和几乎任何印度人都不能承认的，不管有什么样的后果。这是很明显的。关于这一点，不存在调停、调解或仲裁的问题，因为那是荒谬的，正如某人——我想是卡迪尔卡先生（无党派议员——编者按）——所说的，这牵涉到根本改变它的整个地理；把喜马拉雅山作为礼物交给他们。这是一个异乎寻常的要求。不管印度是否存在，这件事是不能同意的。事情就是这样。”
    尼赫鲁说：就他所知，“那就是在麦克马洪线这一边的任何地方都没有中国军队，只有离朗久三英里、或者也许是四英里的地方除外。那里有一小支部队，人们似乎有了一种印象，认为大批大批的中
  国军队驻扎在边界上，或者正在涌往边界。这种印象是不正确的。”他说，“我们要认识，目前真正的危险并不在于有军队涌进来。真正的危险在于北京正在说的那些话。”他又说，“今天我们必须面对的是一个大国，一个侵略性的强国，不管减去共产主义也好，加上共产主义也好，它总可能是侵略性的。可能如此，这是你必须面对的事实。”
    尼赫鲁谈到1954年中印两国签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中，提到了一些让香客和其他人通过的山口。他认为，“这些山口本身在某种意义上就规定了边界，现在像在信中那样在这里和那里对什布奇山口的要求，就山口而论，无疑是对1954年协定的破坏。”他还说，西藏地方当局对待印度在西藏的使团和贸易机构“一贯是无礼的”。
    尼赫鲁还表示不同意周恩来总理的信中所说关于中国和锡金的边界问题不属于目前的讨论范围这一点。他说，“这个问题的确完全属于我们目前或将来讨论的范围。如果他认为他能把这个问题作为与印度无关的问题来处理，那我们是不同意的。我们已经公开地、正当地承担了若干责任，即如果锡金和不丹遭到进攻，我们就要保卫它们，因此我们非常有必要了解那里的情况，因为如果它们的边境上发生了什么事，那就等于是侵犯了印度边境。”他在答复一个问题时说，“就我所知，（不丹的领土）没有受到侵犯”。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中承认，在印度独立后不久，印度政府收到了西藏地方政府的电报，要求印度归还印藏边界上的领土。但是他说，在英国人统治时期，印度和西藏对一些小地区有争执，“可能这份电报指的是这些有争执的地区、比较小的地区”。
    尼赫鲁说，“我们不应把中国和印度这两个大国之间的这一重大争端导入错误途径。我们要是那样做，将是完全错误的。我们必须保持我们的尊严，同时尽可能坚定地处理这种局势。”
    尼赫鲁还谈到了达赖喇嘛，他说，“印度人民非常尊重达赖喇嘛，但是同时，我们的确多次对他说，他不应当使印度成为进行反对一个友好的国家——我希望这样说——的活动的地方。总的说来，在相当长时间内，鉴于他所受到的压力和紧张情况，可以说他是非常克制的。但是有时他超出了这一点，我们不得不对他的某些言论加以反驳。我们并不希望在这方面发生麻烦，但是由于在我们看来他的某些言论太过分，我们不得不加以反驳。”
    尼赫鲁在讲话中还表示不赞同某些议员提出的要印度政府谋求别人帮助的意见。他说，“我们恪守我们的不结盟政策”。他认为，和平共处五项原则是“不辨自明的真理”。他说，“我们所不能接受、承认或同意的，正是异乎寻常的事情和我引用的这些话。这是基本的态度。一切的事情都是可以谈的，可以妥协的，可以这样办也可以那样办的，正像同任何国家相处时那样。我们总的态度始终是友好的态度，而且甚至是尽量地或自始至终地采取友好的态度，因为根据我们的想法，任何其他的态度是错误的。”
    他还不同意议员卡·辛格提出的要求印度政府派飞机轰炸朗久等地方的意见。
