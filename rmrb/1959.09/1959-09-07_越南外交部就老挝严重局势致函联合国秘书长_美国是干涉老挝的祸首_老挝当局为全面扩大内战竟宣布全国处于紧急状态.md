Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th. The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the afternoon of the 5th, when releasing its statement on the Kingdom of Laos's request to the UN to send an emergency force to Laos, also released a memorandum from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld regarding the current serious situation in Laos.

In response to the shameless trick of the US authorities of crying "stop thief!" while falsely accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of interfering in Laos, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in this memorandum, listed a series of facts exposing the interference and control activities carried out by US imperialism in Laos in military, political, and economic aspects since the restoration of peace, as well as the treasonous and harmful crimes of the Lao reactionaries. The memorandum pointed out that it is precisely US imperialism that is truly interfering in Laos and must be held responsible for the current tense situation in Laos. The memorandum pointed out that the evil actions of US imperialism not only seriously threaten the people of Laos and Vietnam, but also threaten peace in the entire Indochina region and Southeast Asia.

The memorandum reiterated the consistent position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Lao issue: the Lao issue must be resolved seriously in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

Phan Hien, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said that the memorandum had been sent to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and he was asked to forward it to the representatives of the UN members.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th. Vientiane News: Defense Minister Sounthone Pattamavong of the Lao Phoui Sananikone government announced on the 5th that Laos was under a state of emergency.

According to the announcement, based on the decision made by the Kingdom of Laos government to fully expand the anti-people civil war and pave the way for the open introduction of American armed interventionists, the Lao Kingdom military authorities have taken over the police power to "maintain order" throughout the country. Prior to this, the Phoui Sananikone government had already announced on August 1st that it had placed the five provinces of Phongsaly, Sam Neua, Xieng Khouang, Khammouane, and Savannakhet under the military administration of the Commander-in-Chief of the Lao Kingdom Army.

It is reported that the decision to declare a national state of emergency in Laos was made at a meeting attended by Lao Prince Savang Vatthana. Prince Savang Vatthana took over the regency power from Lao King Sisavang Vong on the same day. It is reported that the meeting also decided to request the United Nations to immediately intervene in the situation in Laos.

As previously reported, the Phoui Sananikone government requested the United Nations on the 4th to send an "emergency force" to Laos in order to openly introduce American aggressors to carry out direct armed intervention in Laos and undermine peace in the Indochina region.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th. According to the "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriotic News" published on September 2, the army of the Lao Phoui Sananikone government continues to conduct "sweeps" in Khammouane Province to suppress the people. It is reported that from August 13 to 20, in the two places of Liphi and Muong Xon alone, the army of the Sananikone government burned down 40 houses of the common people and killed many cattle.

During the "sweep" in the Bon Kho area of Khammouane Province, the army of the Sananikone government arrested and injured five local residents. During the "sweeps" in Gang Ha and Shin Yin, the government troops abducted two civilians.

On August 10, the Lao government army killed two civilians during a "sweep" in Muong Pak, Sam Neua.

In many other areas, such as the Pak Xon area of ​​Xieng Khouang Province and along Route 13, many residents were forced to leave their homes and wander to other places due to the cruel "sweeps".

In many areas of Lower Laos, the Sananikone government also forced the people to concentrate in order to monitor them.
