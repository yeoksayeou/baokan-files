Formerly barren mountains and today a Jiangnan region north of the Great Wall
The Lighthouse People's Commune Changes the Dry Landscape

(Reported by this newspaper) The Lighthouse People's Commune in Zuoyun County, Shanxi Province, located on the ancient Great Wall, has transformed its formerly dry and barren landscape in the year since communization. The masses sing poems praising the People's Commune: "Former barren mountains and bare ridges, today cattle and sheep fill the mountains; fish and ducks have never met since ancient times, but today they swim happily in the lake; the People's Commune is good, the village has become Jiangnan."

The Lighthouse People's Commune was formed in August of last year from the original thirty-six advanced cooperatives. The area is sparsely populated (averaging fourteen mu of land per person), with large winds and little rainfall, often suffering from spring droughts and autumn floods. Before collectivization, the yield per mu of grain was less than sixty jin. Due to a lack of pasture, animal husbandry was also not prosperous.

Mountain floods often caused damage here. In 1935, a single mountain flood destroyed more than 60,000 mu of farmland. After collectivization, agricultural cooperatives built some canals to divert floodwaters for irrigation, but water damage still occurred year after year. In 1955, some cadres and members of the agricultural cooperatives wanted to build a large reservoir within the current commune's boundaries to store water, but how could one agricultural cooperative manage that? The construction of the reservoir began just three months after the establishment of the People's Commune. According to need, the commune transferred six hundred laborers from various management districts, based on the principle of equal value exchange, and worked hard for eight months, completing the reservoir with a storage capacity of 27 million cubic meters before the floodwaters rose this year. At the same time, the commune also built a small reservoir downstream with a storage capacity of 5 million cubic meters, ensuring that not a single drop of water was lost. This year's mountain floods were the largest in history, but the disaster became powerless in the face of the powerful People's Commune. Thirty thousand mu of dry land in the entire commune has been transformed into irrigated land. Now the commune has bought locomotive boilers and diesel engines to pump water for irrigation day and night. The commune members joyfully call this reservoir "West Lake of the Village." Currently, a hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of 87 kilowatts and a agricultural product processing plant are being built on the reservoir.

In order to develop animal husbandry, according to local natural conditions, fifteen management districts were designated to focus on developing animal husbandry, planting a large amount of pasture in addition to a portion of the better land for crops. This not only allows for a large number of livestock to be fed, but also maintains water and soil, fertilizes the soil, and reduces wind and sand. The commune has also established a comprehensive improved seed breeding station. Now the commune's mules, horses, donkeys, cattle, pigs, sheep, and other livestock average more than thirteen head per household.

After communization, due to the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, vigorous technical reforms were carried out, resulting in the reform of more than 5,000 tools in one year. This has completely changed the backward phenomenon of extensive agricultural production in this sparsely populated and labor-scarce area. This one item alone is equivalent to an increase of 380,000 workdays. In addition, the establishment of eighty-one kindergartens and more than one hundred and thirty canteens after communization freed a large number of female laborers from housework and allowed them to participate in agricultural production. This year, the level of agricultural production has been greatly improved, resulting in a 110% increase in spring wheat compared to last year. Various autumn crops are also growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected.

### 昔日荒山秃岭　今天塞上江南  灯塔人民公社改变干旱面貌

    昔日荒山秃岭　今天塞上江南
    灯塔人民公社改变干旱面貌
    本报讯　位处古长城寨上的山西省左云县灯塔人民公社，公社化一年来，改变了昔日干旱荒凉的面貌。群众作诗歌颂人民公社：昔日荒山秃岭，今日牛羊满山；自古鱼鸭未见面，今日湖中游得欢；人民公社好，寨上变江南。
    灯塔人民公社，是去年8月由原来的三十六个高级社组成。这里地广人稀（每人平均十四亩土地），风砂大，雨量少，经常春旱秋涝。合作化以前，一亩地产粮在六十斤以下。因为缺乏牧草，畜牧业也不兴旺。
    这里山洪还经常为害。1935年一次山洪就冲毁了六万多亩田地。合作化以后，农业社修了一些渠道，引洪灌溉，但水害还是连年发生。1955年，一些农业社的干部和社员就想在现在的公社境内修一座大水库，把水蓄起来，但是一个农业社哪里能办得到呢？人民公社成立刚刚三个月，修建水库工程就开工了。公社根据需要，以等价交换的原则，从各管理区抽调了六百个劳动力，大干八个月，到今年洪水暴涨之前就修成了这座可蓄水二千七百万立方的大水库。同时，公社还在下游修了一个蓄水五百万立方的小水库，不让跑掉一滴水。今年山洪之大，为历史上罕有，灾害在强大的人民公社面前变得无能为力了。全公社已有三万亩旱地变成了水地。现在公社已经买来锅驼机、柴油机日夜抽水灌田。社员们以喜悦的心情叫这座水库是“寨上西湖”。现在，正在水库上兴建一座发电八十七瓩的水电站和农产品加工厂。
    为了发展牧畜业，根据当地的自然条件，确定了十五个管理区以发展牧畜为主，除一部分较好的土地种庄稼以外，大量种植牧草。这样，不仅可以大量喂养牲畜，还保持水土，肥沃了土壤，减少风沙。公社还建立综合良种配种站，现在全社的骡马驴牛猪羊六畜，每户平均已达到十三头多。
    公社化以后，由于广大社员的生产积极性空前高涨，大力进行了技术改革，一年来共改革工具五千多件。因而使这个地广人稀、劳力奇缺的地方，彻底改变了以往农业生产耕作粗放的落后现象。仅这一项，就等于增加了三十八万个劳动日。再加上公社化以后成立了八十一个幼儿园，一百三十多个食堂，使大批妇女劳力摆脱了家务劳动参加了农业生产。今年农业生产的耕作水平有了很大的提高，因而今年的春小麦比去年增产110％。各种大秋作物也生长良好，丰收在望。
