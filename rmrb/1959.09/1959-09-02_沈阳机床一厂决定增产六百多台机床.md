Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 1st. The workers of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant are responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with a fighting spirit. In order to contribute to the battle task of completing the machine tool production target of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, they decided to revise the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and increase the target for increasing machine tool production this year from the original 418 units to 612 units.

The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is a key factory built with Soviet assistance during the First Five-Year Plan period. It is the largest and best-equipped machine tool manufacturing factory in the country. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the factory produced more than 6,000 machine tools of various types, more than doubling the machine tool output in 1957.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's new plan for increasing production and practicing economy, many groups and workers throughout the plant have put forward their specific fighting goals and measures for completing the plan ahead of schedule. In recent days, deeds of technological innovation and improving work efficiency and quality have been constantly emerging in various workshops. In Workshop No. 5, workers have been actively finding opponents and launching friendly competitions. Fitter Zhou Zhenhua innovated five kinds of tools in one day, which can increase efficiency by one to seven times. Worker Li Jingtai improved the chuck, shortened the auxiliary time, and completed 25 hours of work in eight hours. The highest record of veteran worker Wang Baohuan in processing headstock boxes in the past was three and a half units a day. Now he and his apprentice cooperate closely, with one person watching two lathes, and they complete five units a day. In processing a semi-automatic lathe, workers Zhang Xijiu and Liu Xizhong cooperated with each other, using a planer instead of a boring machine to process parts, increasing processing efficiency by four times and ensuring that the quality of the parts meets the standards. The machine tool output of the whole factory has been increasing every day since August 27.

    沈阳机床一厂决定增产六百多台机床
    新华社沈阳1日电　沈阳第一机床厂职工以战斗的姿态响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召。他们为了在今年提前完成第二个五年计划机床生产指标的战斗任务中贡献力量，决定修订增产节约计划，将今年增产机床的指标由原定的四百一十八台提高到六百一十二台。
    沈阳第一机床厂是第一个五年计划期间苏联帮助我国建设的重点工厂，是全国最大、技术装备最好的机床制造工厂。在去年大跃进中，全厂曾生产各种机床六千多台，比1957年机床产量提高一倍以上。
    为了保证完成今年新的增产节约计划，全厂许多小组和工人都提出自己提前完成这个计划的具体奋斗目标和措施。最近几天，革新技术、提高工作效率和质量的事迹已经在各车间不断地出现。在五号车间里，工人们纷纷自找对象，热烈地展开了对手友谊赛。钳工周振华一天之内革新五种工具，可以提高效率一倍到七倍。工人李景泰改进卡具，缩短辅助时间，在八小时里完成了二十五小时工作量。老工人王宝环过去加工床头箱的最高纪录是一天做三台半，现在他和徒弟密切配合，一人看两台床子，一天完成了五台。在加工一种半自动化车床中，工人张锡久和刘希忠互相协作，用刨床代替搪床加工零件，将加工效率提高四倍，而且保证了零件质量合乎标准。全厂的机床产量，从8月27日以来天天在增加。
