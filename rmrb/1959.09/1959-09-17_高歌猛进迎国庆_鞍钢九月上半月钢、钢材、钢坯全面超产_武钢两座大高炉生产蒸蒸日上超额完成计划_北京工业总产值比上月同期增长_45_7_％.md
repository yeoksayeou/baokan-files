Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th September: Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) workers have overfulfilled the state production plan for the first half of September for major products such as steel, steel billets, steel materials, and metallurgical coke. Among them, steel production exceeded the plan by 434 tons, steel materials by 7,854 tons, steel billets by 23,313 tons, and metallurgical coke by 4,706 tons.

    Significant achievements were also made in pig iron production during the first half of the month, with output increasing by 8.9% compared to the same period in August. Furthermore, on the 13th, daily production exceeded the plan by 3.9%, setting a new daily production record since operations began.

    To ensure the early completion of this year's production plan, Angang workers have recently launched extensive and enthusiastic technical performance competitions. In this competition, workers from the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces took the lead, forging ahead. After overproducing 11,000 tons of high-quality steel in August, they overproduced another 3,452 tons of high-quality steel in the first half of September. Currently, they are focusing on strengthening furnace maintenance and conducting in-depth performance competitions in all aspects, determined to achieve even better results in the second half of the month. Workers from other open-hearth furnaces are also working hard to catch up with the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces.

    After completing the original proposal to increase steel production by 100,000 tons in the third quarter one month and one day ahead of schedule, the workers of Angang's thirteen rolling mills are increasingly motivated. The entire staff of the primary rolling mill has been working hard day and night, launching a vigorous performance competition. After breaking through the 10,000-ton mark for daily rolled steel ingots on the 9th, they maintained the new record of 10,000 tons rolled daily for five consecutive days until the 13th. As a result, the entire plant overproduced more than 16,000 tons of steel billets in the first half of September, ensuring a normal supply of steel billet raw materials to various rolling mills. In August, the workers of the No. 1 Medium Plate Mill overproduced more than 3,600 tons of steel plates, completing two months' worth of National Day tribute plans in one month. In the first half of September, they overproduced another 2,914 tons of high-quality steel plates. Since entering September, the workers of the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill, No. 2 Primary Rolling Mill, No. 1 and No. 2 Thin Plate Mills, and the Plate Rolling Mill have been exceptionally enthusiastic and have all overfulfilled the steel material production plan for the first half of the month.

    Workers at factories and mines such as the Chemical General Plant, Sintering General Plant, and Dagushan Iron Mine have also launched in-depth performance competitions to ensure that the open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces are well-fed. Through performance competitions, workers in the No. 2 Coking Workshop of the Chemical General Plant completely eliminated phenomena such as oil leaks and fires in No. 3 coke oven. After implementing sixteen measures to increase production and conserve resources, the No. 5 Coking Workshop increased the coal loading capacity from 15.6 tons to 15.95 tons. Through performance competitions, the workers of the Sintering General Plant not only improved the qualification rate of sintered ore in the first half of September but also eliminated the problem of excessive waste products in the briquette ore workshop in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th September: The output of the two large blast furnaces at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (Wugang) is booming. By September 15, they had overfulfilled the national plan for the first half of the month by 2.04%, producing 13,400 tons more pig iron than the same period in August.

    After the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of these two blast furnaces engaged in labor competitions, striving to outdo each other. The three shifts of workers in each furnace also competed against each other. Iron tap workers competed against iron tap workers, and sand tap workers competed against sand tap workers, focusing on controlling the three key points of the iron tap, sand tap, and slag tap to ensure punctual iron tapping.

    Wugang General Corporation has strengthened its leadership over blast furnace production, paying attention to organizing cooperation between various production departments and the iron smelting plant to strive for high-quality and high-yield blast furnace production. For example, the transportation department and the iron smelting plant had previously experienced poor coordination due to insufficient communication. Now, the leaders of the two units have visited each other to improve relations. The Party Secretary of the Transportation Department personally organized transportation work at the iron smelting plant, changing the past situation where molten iron could not be transported out. Within the iron smelting plant, through opposing right-leaning thoughts, they have given full play to subjective initiative and worked hard to overcome weak links in production. Regardless of day or night, those in charge of the iron smelting plant take turns on duty, guarding the iron casting gate. Lü Guangze, the Party Secretary of the Iron Smelting Plant, took charge of the raw material system and, together with the masses, overcame eighteen key problems, ensuring that coke and ore were fully stocked, guaranteeing that Blast Furnaces No. 1 and No. 2 were "well-fed."

This newspaper reports: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the upsurge of the production increase and conservation campaign on the capital's industrial front is developing rapidly on an unprecedented scale. The city's workers are striving to be the first, and the production level is rising rapidly.

    According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, in the first ten days of September, the city's total industrial output value increased by 56.3% compared with the same period in August, and the first five days of mid-September increased by 27% compared with the first five days of the first ten days of the month. The city's total industrial output value for the first half of the month completed 52.8% of the monthly plan, an increase of 45.7% compared with the same period last month. The output of major products has also made great leaps forward. Compared with the same period last month, steel increased by 35.7%, pig iron increased by 16.5%, steel increased by 37.1%, coal increased by 23.2%, electricity increased by 20.8%, and cotton yarn increased by 22.6%. Product quality is also constantly improving.

    Socialist labor competitions are being carried out vigorously in various factories and mining enterprises throughout the city, and the number of workers exceeding quotas is increasing. The No. 1 Work Section of the Metalworking Workshop of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant has a total of twenty-nine workers. Originally, only two people exceeded the quota, but now there are twenty-five people. This work section completed 53% of the entire month's task from September 2 to 4. Of the 1,800 workers with quotas in the Third Branch Factory of the North China Wireless Appliance Factory, 90% reached the quota, and 65% of them exceeded the quota.

    In the production increase and conservation campaign, advanced experience is widely promoted in various factories and mines, and mass technological innovations are constantly emerging. The eighteen major technological key points of the papermaking machine at the People's Machinery Plant have been broken through in thirteen items. The Beijing Electron Tube Factory solved seventy-one major technical problems in the first nine days of September. The seventy-seven technical innovations realized by Xuanwu Machinery Factory in the first ten days of September generally improved efficiency by more than two times.

    In the competition, factories and the broad masses of employees help each other and make progress together. In the mutual competition between the converter workshop of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plant, and Beijing Special Steel Plant, they exchange information. When one unit encounters difficulties, the other two units provide assistance in manpower and technology. Wang Sen and Liu Yongzhi group of the Ninth Branch Factory of Beijing Electron Tube Factory share equipment and do electronic tube sealing and exhaust work. In the competition, the workers of these two groups scrambled to repair the machines, creating various favorable conditions for the next shift. Since entering September, the shift output has been higher than the previous one. When the shift output of the Wang Sen group increased from 4,000 to 5,700, the Liu Yongzhi group immediately caught up and reached 6,200. The workers immediately created favorable conditions for the next shift, so that the shift output of the Wang Sen group surpassed itself again, reaching 6,580.

    High production and high quality, and an all-round great leap forward are the clear characteristics of the production upsurge. While increasing output, Beijing Steel Plant, Beijing Special Steel Plant, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company achieved qualified rates of converter steel of 96.04%, 98.77%, and 99.39% respectively in the first ten days of September. The foundry workshop of the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory was completely red in the first ten days of September. Each group completed and overfulfilled the plan, and the value of production completed in the first ten days of the workshop increased by 144.28% compared with the same period in August; The scrap rate has also been greatly reduced. The scrap rate in the first ten days of August was 32.2%, which quickly dropped to 4.8% in the first ten days of September.

    The new production upsurge on the Beijing industrial front is the result of thoroughly implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and continuously opposing Right deviation and boosting morale. As the tenth anniversary of National Day approaches, the enthusiasm of the city's workers is growing stronger and stronger. They vow to dedicate excellent achievements in completing and overfulfilling the plans for September and the third quarter to the great festival.

    鞍钢九月上半月钢、钢材、钢坯全面超产
    武钢两座大高炉生产蒸蒸日上超额完成计划
    北京工业总产值比上月同期增长45.7％
    新华社鞍山16日电　鞍钢职工超额完成了9月上半月的钢、钢坯、钢材、冶金焦炭等主要产品产量的国家生产计划。其中，钢超产四百三十四吨，钢材超产七千八百五十四吨，钢坯超产二万三千三百一十三吨，冶金焦炭超产四千七百零六吨。
    在生铁生产方面，上半月也取得很大的成绩，产量比8月同期提高8.9％，而且在13日超过日产计划3.9％，创造开工以来的日产新纪录。
    鞍钢职工为了保证提前完成今年的生产计划，最近广泛热烈地展开了技术表演竞赛。在这场竞赛中，五座大型固定式平炉的职工一马当先，跑在最前面；他们在8月份超产优质钢一万一千吨以后，9月上半月又超产优质钢三千四百五十二吨。现在，他们正在围绕着加强炉体维护，从各方面深入展开表演竞赛，决心在下半月创造更优异的成绩。其他各个平炉上的职工，也在快马加鞭，向五座大型固定式平炉看齐。
    鞍钢十三个轧钢厂的职工在提前一个月零一天完成原订第三季度增产钢材十万吨的倡议以后，干劲越来越大。初轧厂全体职工日夜苦战巧战，掀起轰轰烈烈的表演竞赛，在9日突破日轧钢锭万吨关之后，到13日连续五天保持了日轧万吨的新纪录。这样，全厂9月上半月超产了钢坯一万六千多吨，保证了各轧钢厂钢坯原料的正常供应。第一中板厂的职工在8月份超产钢板三千六百多吨，一个月完成了两个月的国庆献礼计划之后，在9月上半月又超产了优质钢板二千九百一十四吨。第一初轧厂、第二初轧厂、第一第二薄板厂、轧板厂等轧钢厂的职工，进入9月以来干劲异常高昂，都超额完成了上半月的钢材生产计划。
    化工总厂、烧结总厂、大孤山铁矿等厂矿的职工，为保证平炉和高炉吃饱吃好，也深入展开了表演竞赛。化工总厂第二炼焦车间的职工通过表演竞赛，彻底消除了三号焦炉跑油冒火等现象。第五炼焦车间实现了十六项增产节约的措施以后，装煤量从过去的一五点六吨提高到一五点九五吨。烧结总厂的职工通过表演竞赛，在9月上半月不仅提高了烧结矿的合格率，而且消灭了过去团矿车间原料废品过多的现象。
    据新华社武汉16日电　武汉钢铁公司两座大型高炉的产量蒸蒸日上，到9月15日，超额2.04％完成了上半月的国家计划，比8月同期多产一万三千四百吨生铁。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，这两座高炉的工人你追我赶，更加热烈地展开劳动竞赛；各个炉子的三班工人，也互相竞赛；铁口工人和铁口工人、砂口工人和砂口工人之间展开对口赛，把好铁口、砂口、渣口三大关，保证了正点出铁。
    武钢总公司加强了对高炉生产的领导，注意组织各生产部门和炼铁厂协作，为高炉优质高产而努力。如运输部和炼铁厂曾因联系不紧而相互配合不好，现在两个单位的领导人都相互登门拜访，运输部的党委书记亲自到炼铁厂组织运输工作，改变了过去铁水运不出去的现象。炼铁厂内部通过反对右倾思想，发挥主观能动性，努力克服生产中的薄弱环节。不管白天黑夜，炼铁厂的负责人都轮流值班，把守铸铁关。炼铁厂党委书记吕光泽抓原料系统，和群众一起攻破了十八个关键，从而使焦炭满槽、矿石满仓，保证一、二号高炉“吃饱吃好”。
    本报讯　建国十周年前夕，首都工业战线增产节约运动的高潮正以空前未有的规模迅速向前发展，全市职工奋勇争先，生产水平飞速上升。
    据北京市统计局的统计，9月上旬，全市工业总产值比8月同期增长了56.3％，中旬前五天又比上旬前五天增长了27％，全市上半月的工业总产值完成全月计划的52.8％，比上月同期增长45.7％。主要产品产量也有了较大的跃进，和上月同期相比，钢增长35.7％，生铁增长16.5％，钢材增长37.1％，煤增长23.2％，电力增长20.8％，棉纱增长22.6％。产品质量也不断提高。
  　社会主义劳动竞赛在全市各厂矿企业搞得轰轰烈烈，突破定额的职工越来越多。北京汽车制造厂金工车间一工段共有职工二十九人，原来只有两人突破定额，现在已有二十五人。这个工段在9月2日至4日就完成了全月任务的53％。华北无线电器材厂三分厂有定额的一千八百名工人中，有90％的人达到定额，其中65％的人突破了定额。
    在增产节约运动中，各厂矿普遍推广先进经验，群众性的技术革新不断出现。人民机器厂造纸机的十八项重大技术关键已经突破十三项。北京电子管厂9月前九天解决了七十一项重大技术关键问题。宣武机械厂9月上旬实现的七十七项技术革新，一般都提高效率两倍以上。
    在竞赛中，工厂之间与广大职工之间互相帮助、共同跃进。石景山钢铁公司转炉车间、北京钢厂、北京特殊钢厂在互相竞赛中，互通情报，一个单位碰到困难，另外两个单位就在人力技术上进行帮助。北京电子管厂九分厂王森和刘永志小组，共用设备，都做电子管封口排气工作。这两个小组的工人在竞赛中，抢着检修机器，上班为下班创造各种有利条件。进入9月以后，班产量一组比一组高，当王森小组的班产量由四千只增到五千七百只时，刘永志小组立即赶过达到六千二百只，工人们并马上为下班创造有利条件，使王森小组的班产量又赶过了自己，达到六千五百八十只。
    既高产又优质，全面大跃进，是生产高潮的显明特点。北京钢厂、北京特殊钢厂和石景山钢铁公司在提高产量的同时，9月上旬转炉钢的合格率分别达到了96.04％、98.77％和99.39％。第一机床厂铸工车间9月上旬满堂红，每个小组都完成和超额完成计划，全车间上旬完成产值计划的数字，比8月同期增长144.28％；废品率也大大下降，8月上旬的废品率为32.2％，9月上旬即迅速下降到4.8％。
    北京市工业战线上新的生产高潮，是深入贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议，不断反右倾、鼓干劲的结果。随着国庆十周年的日益临近，全市职工的干劲越来越足，他们誓以完成和超额完成9月份和第三季度计划的出色成绩，向伟大的节日献礼。
