　　Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch: The 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York on the 15th.

　　The meeting was declared open by Malik of Lebanon, President of the previous session. Lebanese Prime Minister Karami, head of the Lebanese delegation, then delivered a brief speech. He said that all contentious issues could be resolved through peaceful means, and he expressed the hope that the Geneva conference discussing the cessation of nuclear weapons testing would achieve positive results.

　　The Assembly then elected the members of the Credentials Committee and the President of the current session of the Assembly, resulting in the election of Victor Belaunde of Peru.

　　The seven working committees of the Assembly met and elected their chairmen.

　　Franz Matsch (Austria) was elected Chairman of the Political and Security Committee.

　　Charles King (Liberia) was elected Chairman of the Special Political Committee.

　　Marcial Tamayo (Bolivia) was elected Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee.

　　Jorge Cyssele (Belgium) was elected Chairman of the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee.

　　Lambertus D. Palar (Indonesia) was elected Chairman of the Trusteeship Committee.

　　Jiří Nosek (Czechoslovakia) was elected Chairman of the Administrative and Budgetary Committee.

　　Alberto Herrarte (Guatemala) was elected Chairman of the Legal Committee.

　　The Assembly also elected thirteen Vice-Presidents of the session that day. The General Committee of the session was then established, consisting of twenty-one members: the President of the General Assembly, the Vice-Presidents, and the Chairmen of the working committees. The task of the General Committee is to make recommendations regarding the agenda of the session.

　　The next plenary meeting of the General Assembly will be held on September 17, to begin the general debate.

　　The situation before the UN General Assembly indicates that the international reactionary forces, headed by the "Cold War" guardians of the United States, are afraid of the relaxation of the international situation and are still trying to use the United Nations as a tool to pursue their aggressive policies. Prior to the opening of this session of the Assembly, the Security Council, under the control of the United States, passed an illegal resolution to send a so-called "investigation" sub-committee to Laos. This resolution grossly violated the UN Charter and clearly exposed the US conspiracy to usurp the UN flag to interfere in the situation in Laos. After the Dalai Lama was instigated to issue an "appeal" to the United Nations in the name of the so-called "Tibetan government," the US State Department immediately came forward to support it. Some major American newspapers have also been clamoring for a discussion of the "Tibetan issue" at the United Nations, trying to stir up a slander and defamation campaign against New China.

　　The issue of anti-colonialism will occupy an important place at this session of the UN General Assembly. At the suggestion of Asian and African countries, the Algerian issue has been included in the provisional agenda of the Assembly, despite opposition from France. In a statement, the Asian-African Group at the United Nations said that it "unconditionally supports the right of the Algerian people to independence" and believes that "a just solution to the Algerian issue can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the French government and the representatives of the Algerian people."

　　The issue of universal disarmament has not yet been included in the provisional agenda of the Assembly. At a meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Committee on the 10th, representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France informed the members of the committee that the four major powers had reached an agreement on the establishment of a ten-nation disarmament committee, which was welcomed by the meeting. The three issues related to partial disarmament measures currently facing the United Nations General Assembly are: Morocco's proposal to include the issue of France's plan to test atomic bombs in the Sahara on the agenda, Ireland's proposal to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and India's proposal to include the issue of the cessation of nuclear testing on the agenda. It is expected that there will be fierce struggles when the Assembly discusses these issues.

　　This session of the Assembly will also discuss the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa, the economic development of underdeveloped countries, and the so-called Korean issue, etc. The Assembly will continue until the end of this year.

    联大第十四届会议开幕
    各种迹象表明美国仍准备在会上搞“冷战”
　　本报综合报道　据新华社讯：塔斯社纽约消息：联合国大会第十四届会议15日在纽约开幕。
　　会议由上届会议主席、黎巴嫩的马利克宣布开会。黎巴嫩代表团团长卡拉米总理接着发表了简短的演说。他说，一切争执的问题都可以通过和平的方法来解决，他并且表示希望讨论停止试验核武器问题的日内瓦会议能够获得积极的结果。
　　然后，大会选举了代表证书审查委员会的成员，并且选举大会本届会议主席，结果秘鲁代表维克托·贝朗德当选。
　　大会的七个工作委员会举行了会议，选举它们的主席。
　　弗朗茨·马契（奥地利）当选为政治及安全委员会主席。
　　查尔斯·金（利比里亚）当选为特别政治委员会主席。　
  　马西亚尔·塔马约（玻利维亚）当选为经济及财政委员会主席。　
  　若热·西泽勒（比利时）当选为社会、人道及文化委员会主席。　
  　兰贝图斯·巴拉（印度尼西亚）当选为托管委员会主席。 　 伊·诺塞克（捷克斯洛伐克）当选为行政及预算委员会主席。
　　阿尔贝托·埃拉尔特（危地马拉）当选为法律委员会主席。
　　大会全体会议这一天还选举了会议的十三个副主席。然后成立了会议的总务委员会，委员会由二十一人组成：大会会议主席，各个副主席，各工作委员会的主席。总务委员会的任务是提出关于会议议程的建议。
    大会下次全体会议将在9月17日举行，开始一般性辩论。
    联合国大会会前的情况表明，以美国“冷战”卫士为首的国际反动势力害怕国际局势缓和，仍在力图利用联合国作为他们推行侵略政策的工具。在本届大会开幕以前，安全理事会在美国的把持下通过了派遣所谓“调查”小组委员会到老挝去的非法决议。这个决议粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章，清楚地暴露了美国要盗用联合国旗帜来干涉老挝局势的阴谋。在达赖喇嘛被怂恿以所谓“西藏政府”的名义向联合国发出“呼吁”以后，美国国务院立即出面支持。美国一些大报也一直叫嚷要在联合国讨论“西藏问题”，竭力想掀起一个反对新中国的污蔑和诽谤运动。
    在联合国大会本届会议上，反殖民主义的问题将占有重要地位。根据亚非国家的建议，阿尔及利亚问题已列入大会临时议程，尽管法国方面表示反对。联合国亚非集团在一份声明中说，亚非集团“无条件地支持阿尔及利亚人民独立的权利”，并且认为“只有通过法国政府同阿尔及利亚人民的代表直接的谈判，才能公正地解决阿尔及利亚问题”。
    关于普遍裁军问题，至今还没有列入大会的临时议程中。在联合国裁军委员会10日举行会议时，苏、美、英、法四国代表通知委员会的成员说，四大国已经就建立一个十国裁军委员会达成协议，这个协议受到会议的欢迎。现在联合国大会面临的三个同局部裁军措施有关的问题是：摩洛哥提出的要求把法国计划在撒哈拉试验原子弹的问题列入议程的提案，爱尔兰提出的要求防止扩大核武器的散布的提案以及印度提出的要求把停止核试验问题列入议程的提案。预料大会在讨论这些问题时将有激烈的斗争。
    本届大会还将要讨论南非种族歧视问题、落后国家的经济发展问题和所谓朝鲜问题等等。大会将要开到今年年底。
