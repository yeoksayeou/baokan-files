Xinhua News Agency, September 17th Dispatch from New York: According to TASS reports from New York, the General Committee of the 14th Session of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 16th to discuss the agenda of the 14th Session. The majority of the items on the meeting's agenda were adopted without any opposition. However, fierce debates unfolded over some issues.

The most acute struggle in the committee revolved around the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and its specialized agencies, proposed by India. The head of the Indian delegation, Indian Defense Minister Menon, spoke first. He emphasized that for the benefit of the United Nations and for friendship and mutual understanding between countries, this issue should be included on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Under the pretext that discussing this issue was "inopportune," the U.S. representative Wadsworth violated the UN Charter and put forward a proposal demanding that the UN General Assembly not discuss, at this session, the issue of expelling the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the UN and inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China.

Representatives from Britain, the Philippines, Turkey, Bolivia, and the Chiang Kai-shek elements echoed the U.S. proposal.

Representatives from the Soviet Union, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Indonesia pointed out in their speeches that the U.S. delegation's position on this issue was completely unfounded.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov said that the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is one of the important issues of the day, and that further avoidance of discussing this long-unresolved issue would inevitably cause serious damage to the prestige of the United Nations and to the cause of peaceful cooperation among peoples.

The Soviet representative pointed out the great achievements made by the great Chinese people and the growing international prestige of the People's Republic of China. He also pointed out that the argument that the time has not yet come to discuss the issue of China's representation in the United Nations is completely untenable.

Lambertus Bala (Indonesia) emphasized that the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is of particular importance and cannot be delayed any longer. Bala expressed his opposition to the U.S. proposal.

Romanian representative Brucan asked in his speech: "How can we discuss peace in Asia if China is not allowed to enter the United Nations?" The Romanian representative pointed out that the General Committee has no right to obstruct the UN General Assembly from discussing this issue.

Czechoslovak representative Nosek called on the United Nations to eradicate the remnants of the Cold War and demanded that representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique be expelled from the United Nations. After the Czechoslovak representative spoke, the Chairman of the General Committee, Béruard, put the U.S. proposal to a vote.

A majority of the General Committee voted in favor of the U.S. proposal, thereby supporting the position of the Cold War apologists. Eleven delegations (Liberia, Bolivia, Belgium, Guatemala, Brazil, France, the Philippines, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, Britain, the United States) and the Chiang Kai-shek elements supported the U.S. proposal. Seven delegations (Burma, Indonesia, Morocco, Romania, the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia) opposed the U.S. proposal. The Austrian representative abstained.

The committee then began to discuss other issues. Disregarding the opposition of the French representative, the committee included the Algerian question on the agenda, as well as the question of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, the question of observing the principle of geographical distribution in the election of the President of the UN General Assembly, the question of France's attempt to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara, and other issues.

    联大总务委员会在美国操纵下
    竟拒绝把中国代表权问题列入议程
    美国无理态度遭到苏罗捷等国代表的谴责
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会第十四届会议总务委员会16日举行会议，讨论了第十四届会议的议程。会议议程的大多数项目没有任何反对就通过了。但是，有一些问题展开了激烈辩论。
    印度提出的关于中华人民共和国在联合国及其专门机构的代表权问题在委员会中展开了最尖锐的斗争。印度代表团团长、印度国防部长梅农首先发言。他强调说，为了联合国的利益，为了国与国之间的友谊和相互了解，这个问题应当列入联合国大会本届会议的议程。
    美国代表华兹沃斯借口讨论这个问题“不合时宜”，竟违背联合国宪章，提出了一项提案，要求联合国大会在本届会议上不讨论把蒋介石集团代表开除出联合国和邀请中华人民共和国代表的问题。
    英国、菲律宾、土耳其、玻利维亚的代表和蒋介石分子附和美国提案。
    苏联、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和印度尼西亚的代表在发言中指出，美国代表团在这一问题上的立场是完全没有根据的。
    苏联代表团副团长库兹涅佐夫说，关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题是当前重要问题之一，如果再回避讨论这个长久以来没有解决的问题，不能不对联合国的威信和对各国人民和平合作的事业造成严重损失。
    苏联代表指出了伟大的中国人民所取得的巨大成就和中华人民共和国的日益增长的国际威望，他还指出，所谓讨论中国在联合国的代表权问题的时机还没有到来的说法，是完全站不住脚的。
    兰贝图斯·巴拉（印度尼西亚）着重指出，关于中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题具有特别重要性，不容许再拖下去。巴拉表示反对美国提案。
    罗马尼亚代表布鲁坎在发言中问道：“如果不让中国进入联合国，怎么能讨论亚洲的和平问题呢？”罗马尼亚代表指出，总务委员会没有权利阻挠联合国大会讨论这一问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺塞克呼吁联合国铲除冷战残余，并且要求把蒋介石集团的代表从联合国驱逐出去。在捷克斯洛伐克的代表发言之后，总务委员会主席贝朗德把美国提案提付表决。
    总务委员会多数投票赞成美国提案，从而支持了冷战维护者的立场。支持美国提案的有十一个代表团（利比里亚、玻利维亚、比利时、危地马拉、巴西、法国、菲律宾、土耳其、南非联邦、英国、美国）和蒋介石分子，七个代表团（缅甸、印度尼西亚、摩洛哥、罗马尼亚、苏联、瑞典和捷克斯洛伐克）反对美国提案，奥地利代表弃权。
    委员会接着开始讨论其他问题。委员会不顾法国代表的反对，把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程，列入议程的还有：关于南非联邦的种族歧视问题、关于在选举联合国大会主席时遵守按地域分配原则的问题、关于法国企图在撒哈拉进行核试验的问题以及其他问题。
