Xinhua News Agency, Miyun, 7th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing, participating in the construction of the Miyun Reservoir, had ten military engineering detachments awarded ten Champion Red Banners. The more than ten thousand officers and soldiers who fiercely attacked the dam were praised as a model among the two hundred thousand strong labor force.

A Beijing-based unit that had previously participated in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir and Huairou Reservoir projects arrived at the Miyun Reservoir construction site in October of last year, undertaking the arduous task of cutting slopes and excavating tunnels. In May of this year, during the tense moment of the decisive battle to dam the floodwaters of the Miyun Reservoir, more than ten thousand officers and soldiers from the Beijing troops rushed to the construction site day and night. Together with the civilian workers, they raised the dam by one meter every day. In more than three months of hard work, they completed one million one hundred and sixteen thousand labor days, excavating and filling six hundred and thirty thousand cubic meters of earth, sand, and stone.

The officers and soldiers became a heroic shock force on the construction site. In May, the weather was hot, and the soldiers pushed wheelbarrows and handcarts full of earth back and forth. The dam was high and the slope was steep, making it difficult to maneuver the carts, so they organized cart-pulling teams to pull the carts up the dam. In late July, heavy rains fell continuously, and the water level rose sharply. On the night of the 22nd, the reservoir party committee proposed that the three-meter sloping wall should be rushed to a height of 143 meters within four days. The officers and soldiers immediately threw themselves into this decisive battle with a fighting spirit. The scorching sun blazed like fire, and many people held up large stone tampers, pounding them thirty-two times or more in one breath. The soldiers said: "Even if the difficulty is greater than the sky, it's nothing to us. We will fight the Chao (River) and Bai (River) for the benefit of the people, and we dare to cross mountains of knives and seas of fire!" After four days and nights of hard work, the western section of the dam reached a height of 143 meters ten hours ahead of schedule.

On August 6th, the Chao River construction site was hit by a violent wind and rainstorm. A section of the revetment at the southern end of the dam was in danger of being submerged. He Jianqing, the company commander of the Second Company of a certain unit, led soldiers and civilian workers on rafts to rush and transport stones to protect the slope. When the raft, loaded with several thousand pounds of stones, was returning, it was too heavy to move. They used their feet to paddle in the water and pushed the raft forward with their hands. During the excavation of the Zoumazhuang spillway, the military engineering troops undertook the most dangerous task of breaking the dam's opening. When there were not enough tools, they moved large stones by hand, and when they encountered hard rock layers, they used iron hammers to smash them. Some units launched a "battlefield race" during the transportation of earth. Over a distance of 300 meters, the soldiers carried and lifted loads, running as if flying. Soldier Liu Fu carried thirty-one baskets of sand and earth in half an hour.

The commanders of the troops on the construction site, regardless of day or night, not only directed the troops in construction but also labored alongside the soldiers. Li Jinshi, a senior colonel and commander of a certain unit, had lost an arm to enemy fire in the past. Now, he used one arm to direct the clay battle in the entire work area. Wu Shangzhi, a combat hero who had performed exceptionally in the Battle of Shangganling, directed the battle to rush and build the three-meter sloping wall for twenty-four consecutive hours. The troops they commanded demonstrated bravery, tenacity, and full vigor as soon as they arrived at the construction site, greatly inspiring the labor force throughout the entire construction site. The civilian workers on the construction site took the military workers as models, creating a surge of enthusiasm for learning from the People's Liberation Army.

### 驻京部队官兵在修建密云水库中立功  十个军工支队荣获冠军红旗

    驻京部队官兵在修建密云水库中立功
    十个军工支队荣获冠军红旗
    新华社密云7日电　中国人民解放军驻北京的部队在参加修建密云水库中，十个军工支队荣获十面冠军红旗，猛攻拦水坝的一万多名官兵，被誉为二十万劳动大军中的一支标兵。
    北京部队一支参加过十三陵水库和怀柔水库工程的部队，从去年10月就来到密云水库工地，担负了劈坡和凿隧洞的艰巨工程。今年5
  月，在密云水库拦洪决战的紧张时刻里，北京部队万余官兵星夜开上工地。他们和民工一起，每日使大坝升高一米。在三个多月的苦战中，作了一百一十六万个劳动日，开挖填筑土砂石料六十三万多立方米。
    部队官兵在工地上成为一支英勇的突击队伍。5月间天气炎热，战士们推着装满土的双轮车和单轮车往返奔跑。坝高坡陡，车不好走，他们就组织起拉车队，拉车上坝。7月下旬，连下暴雨，水位猛涨。22日深夜，水库党委提出，要在四天内把三米斜墙抢筑到一百四十三米高程，官兵们立刻以战斗的姿态投入了这场决战。烈日像火一样地晒着，许多人高举着大石夯，一气连打三十二下以上。战士们说：“那怕困难比天大，搁咱身上算个啥，为民造福战潮（河）白（河），刀山火海也敢跨！”经过四昼夜苦战，使大坝西段提前十小时达到一百四十三米高程。
    8月6日，潮河工地狂风暴雨。大坝南头的一段护坡眼看被水淹没，某部队二连连长贺剑青，带着战士和民工，驾着木筏去抢运石头护坡。木筏上装了几千斤石头开回的时候，筏子重，走不动，他们便用两脚在水里踩水，用手推着木筏向前走。在开挖走马庄溢洪道当中，部队军工担负了最艰险的破坝开口工程，在工具不够用的情况下，他们用手搬大石头，遇有坚硬的石层，就用铁锤砸。有的部队在运土当中开展了“阵地赛”，在三百米的距离中，战士们挑的挑，抬的抬，奔走如飞，战士刘福半小时就担了三十一筐砂土。
    工地上的部队指挥员们，不论白天黑夜，一面指挥部队施工，一面与战士一起劳动。某部队长李金时大校，过去在战争中被敌人炮火夺去了一条臂膀，现在，他用一只臂膀指挥着全工区的粘土战役。曾经在上甘岭战役中立过特等功的战斗英雄武尚志，连续二十四小时指挥着抢筑三米斜墙的战斗。他们指挥的部队一来到工地，就表现了勇敢、顽强和十足的干劲，给全工地劳动大军以极大的鼓舞。工地上的民工，都以军工作标兵，掀起了一个学习解放军的热潮。
