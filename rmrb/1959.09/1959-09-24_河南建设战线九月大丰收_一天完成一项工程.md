Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch: Since entering September, Henan Province has been handing over an important infrastructure project for production on average every day. By the 20th of this month, the province had already completed and handed over twenty-two important projects for production ahead of schedule. These include the three-ton converter workshop of Anyang Iron and Steel Company, the one-ton converter workshop of Luoyang Iron and Steel Plant, two 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces in Zhengzhou and Dengfeng Iron and Steel Plants, the Haotang Mine in Pingdingshan, the heat processing workshop of Kaifeng Thermal Instrument Factory, the fine yarn workshop of Luoyang Textile Factory, and the Zhengzhou Alcohol Factory. In addition, there are all the down arrival, marshalling, and departure yards of the Zhengzhou Railway Hub Station, as well as several sections of railway double-tracking projects.

The early completion and handover of these projects for production is the first round of victory won by the basic construction army of Henan Province in their hard work in September. In order to ensure that these projects progressed quickly and were of high quality, they deeply criticized the right-leaning ideas of some cadres and launched a vigorous socialist labor competition. At the same time, they firmly grasped the daily plans, truly achieving daily arrangements and daily inspections, and tried their best to achieve balance in materials, labor, and transportation. Leaders at all levels went deep into the field, grasped the key points, and quickly solved problems, ensuring the smooth completion of the projects.

Now, the basic construction army of the province is advancing victoriously, accelerating the construction of the remaining thirty-plus important projects that need to be completed before National Day. The workers constructing the alloy steel workshop of Anyang Iron and Steel Company, personally led by the company's three managers, worked day and night in three shifts, quickly completing the wall construction of the blower station and the second power distribution station, and handing them over for installation. The metalworking workshop of Zhengzhou Cable Factory originally planned to complete the hoisting task by the end of September for installation, but the workers completed all the hoisting in only twelve and a half days, and started the installation of machinery and equipment on the 15th of this month.

    河南建设战线九月大丰收
    一天完成一项工程
    新华社郑州电　进入9月份以来，河南省平均每天都有一项重要基建工程移交生产。到本月20日止，全省已经提前建成并移交生产的重要工程，共有二十二项。其中有安阳钢铁公司的三吨转炉车间，洛阳钢铁厂的一吨转炉车间，郑州、登封钢铁厂的两座二十八立方米的高炉，平顶山郝堂矿井，开封热工仪表厂热加工车间，洛阳纺织厂细纱车间和郑州酒精厂。此外，还有郑州铁路枢纽站的下行到达、编组和出发三个场的全部工程，以及几段铁路复线工程等。
    这些工程提前建成移交生产，是河南省基本建设大军奋战9月份所赢得的第一个回合的胜利。他们为使这些工程进度快、质量高，深入地批判了一部分干部中的右倾思想，开展了轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛。同时，狠狠地抓日计划，真正做到一日一安排、一检查，并且尽量在材料、劳力、运输等方面做到平衡；各级领导都深入现场，抓关键，迅速解决问题，保证了工程顺利完工。
    现在，全省基本建设大军正乘胜前进，加快建设其余三十多项需要在国庆节以前建成的重要工程。建设安阳钢铁公司合金钢车间的职工在公司三个经理亲自带领下，分三班日夜奋战，很快地将鼓风机站和第二配电站砌墙工程完成，交付安装。郑州电缆厂金工车间原订在9月底完成吊装任务交付安装，而工人只用十二天半的时间就全部吊装完毕，在本月15日开始了机器设备安装工程。
