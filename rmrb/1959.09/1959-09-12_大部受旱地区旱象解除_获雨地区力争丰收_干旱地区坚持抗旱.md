Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Since late August, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the coastal provinces of Southeast China have received rainfall. The severe drought that lasted for about two months in most of these provinces has been relieved; a small number of areas still feel the drought due to insufficient rainfall, but it has also eased somewhat.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture as of the 8th: The nation's drought-affected farmland has been reduced to about 90 million mu. Henan and Hubei still each have 20 million mu of farmland that needs continued drought resistance, Anhui and Sichuan each still have more than 10 million mu of farmland affected by drought, Shaanxi still has about 9 million mu of farmland affected by drought, and Guizhou still has more than 5 million mu of farmland affected by drought. Some areas in Hunan and Jiangxi also still feel insufficient rainfall. The areas with severe drought conditions at present include: Xinyang area and Nanyang area in Henan, Huanggang and Xiangyang areas in Hubei, southeastern and southern Sichuan, Guanzhong area and Weibei Plateau in Shaanxi, etc. These areas either have not received rain or the drought situation has developed anew after rain. Currently, people's communes in these areas, under the leadership of the Party and the government, are vigorously diverting water to irrigate fields and continue to rescue crops. According to incomplete statistics from various provinces, about 220 million mu of drought-affected farmland have been irrigated. All 80 million mu of farmland originally affected by drought in Henan Province have been irrigated, many of which have been irrigated two or three or even three or four times.

The long-awaited rain in vast areas has greatly encouraged the commune members to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. Currently, these areas are carrying out a vigorous production increase campaign, strengthening field management of cotton, late rice, and late autumn crops, and striving to ensure that drought-affected farmland not only does not reduce production but also increases production. Some areas have begun to launch mass movements to build farmland water conservancy projects. The areas that are still fighting drought are launching a major battle to seize grain from the drought.

According to the person in charge of the Drought Resistance Office of the Ministry of Agriculture: The victory of the drought resistance struggle in vast areas has played a huge role in agricultural harvest. This victory is the basis for the current drought-affected areas to strive for less reduction in production, no reduction in production, and overproduction. However, the drought situation in some areas is still very serious, and it is necessary to make persistent efforts to completely overcome the drought. Areas that have been relieved of drought cannot be complacent and must also prevent possible autumn droughts and ensure timely sowing of wheat.

    大部受旱地区旱象解除
    获雨地区力争丰收　干旱地区坚持抗旱
    新华社11日讯　8月下旬以来，黄河中下游、长江下游和东南沿海各省都已先后获雨。这些省区大部地区持续约两月之久的严重干旱已告解除；小部分地区雨量不足仍感干旱，但也有所缓和。
    据农业部截至8日的统计：全国受旱农田已减至九千万亩左右。河南、湖北仍各有二千万亩农田须继续抗旱，安徽、四川仍各有一千多万亩农田受旱，陕西仍有九百万亩左右的农田受旱，贵州仍有五百多万亩农田受旱。其他湖南、江西也有部分地区仍感雨量不足。目前旱情严重的地区计有：河南的信阳地区和南阳地区，湖北的黄冈和襄阳等地区，四川东南部和南部，陕西关中地区和渭北高原等。这些地区或者一直未下雨，或者雨后旱情又有新的发展。现在，这些地区的人民公社，仍在党和政府的领导下大力引水灌田，继续抢救田禾。据各省不完全统计，各地受旱农田已获灌溉的达二亿二千万亩左右。河南省原受旱的八千万亩农田都获得了灌溉，其中不少灌过两三遍到三四遍。
    广大地区久旱获雨，大大鼓舞了公社社员夺取秋季大丰收的干劲。现在这些地区正开展轰轰烈烈的增产运动，加强了对棉花、晚稻和晚秋作物的田间管理，争取受旱农田不但不减产还要增产。有些地区已开始掀起兴修农田水利的群众运动。现在仍在抗旱的地区，正展开与旱灾夺粮的大战。
  据农业部抗旱办公室负责人说：广大地区抗旱斗争的胜利，对农业丰收起了巨大的作用。这个胜利就是当前受旱地区分别争取少减产，不减产和超产的基础。但是，目前部分地区旱象仍很严重，还须再接再厉，彻底战胜干旱。已经解除旱象的地区也不能麻痹，还要防止可能发生的秋旱，保证小麦适时播种。
