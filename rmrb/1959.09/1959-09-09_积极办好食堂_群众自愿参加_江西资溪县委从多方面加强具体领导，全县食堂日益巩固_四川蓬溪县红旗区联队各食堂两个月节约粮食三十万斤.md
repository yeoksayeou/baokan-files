Jiangxi Zixi County Party Committee Strengthens Specific Leadership in Many Ways, Mess Halls Throughout the County are Increasingly Consolidated
Sichuan Pengxi County Red Flag District United Team's Mess Halls Save 300,000 Jin of Grain in Two Months

Since the summer harvest this year, various localities have adopted methods such as allocating grain to households, voluntary participation by individuals, fixed grain rations per person, and all surpluses belonging to the individual, which have consolidated most of the mess halls. We believe that as long as we adopt the principles of actively running mess halls well and voluntary participation, we can achieve the goal of facilitating production and convenience for the masses, and the broad masses of working people will enthusiastically support it.
      — Excerpt from Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on August 26

Nanchang, September 8th (report from this newspaper) -- The Chinese Communist Party Zixi County Committee in Jiangxi Province is actively strengthening its leadership over the people's commune mess halls, constantly fighting against right-leaning ideology, and has consolidated all 354 mess halls in the county.

Zixi County is a mountainous area with a sparse population and a shortage of labor. During last summer's "Double Rush" campaign, more than 120 busy farming season mess halls were established. After communization, they developed into 291 permanent mess halls. Later, based on the characteristics of scattered mountain villages, they were adjusted to the current 354. More than 99% of the rural population in the county eats in the mess halls.

Strengthening Party leadership, implementing the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, vigorously developing diversified operations, and gradually improving the lives of commune members are the main reasons why the public mess halls in Zixi County have been consolidated and improved.

Last year, when the large-scale establishment of mess halls began, a few cadres did not see the role of public mess halls in promoting the Great Leap Forward, and mistakenly believed that the scale was large, there were many people, and it was troublesome and complicated, and difficult to lead. Therefore, they adopted a laissez-faire and passive attitude towards the mess halls. Some illegal bad elements also took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. Under these circumstances, the Zixi County Party Committee took a firm attitude and active measures. During the commune rectification this spring, led by the First Secretary, 18 members of the County Party Committee and more than 1,000 rectification cadres went deep into the mess halls, starting with participation in production and organizing production, leading commune members to summarize the advantages of public mess halls and the experience of running mess halls well, and extensively carrying out free airing of views and debates. This greatly improved the understanding of cadres and commune members, established confidence in running mess halls well, criticized the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres, and powerfully cracked down on bad people. Subsequently, all communes and brigades in the county designated special personnel to lead the mess halls, and transferred a group of Party members, Youth League members, and activists to the mess halls to serve as managers and cooks to actively run the mess halls well.

In implementing the principle of voluntarism, Party committees at all levels regularly visited the masses and widely solicited the opinions of commune members. In the past six months, Party committees at all levels have improved the work of the mess halls in the following aspects based on the opinions of commune members: 1. The scale of the mess halls, based on the production team or natural village as a unit, the original 291 mess halls were divided into 354; 2. In order to take care of the traditional habits of commune members, the method of self-provided tables and benches, one table per household, was adopted to facilitate taking care of children and family reunions; 3. The rations of commune members were based on fixed amounts per person, calculated by household, allocated to households, and savings were returned to the individual. Patients and women in confinement could receive grain to cook at home; 4. Commune members who handed in 100 jin of grain (paddy) could receive about 15 jin of fine bran from the mess hall as feed for private pig raising. Other aspects such as the variety of dishes, tea supply, and hospitality were also handled reasonably according to the opinions and requirements of commune members.

In order to solve the problem of eating vegetables in the mess halls, all public mess halls in the county have established breeding and vegetable groups. At present, the 354 mess halls in the county raise more than 11,000 pigs, more than 74,000 poultry, plant 3,780 mu of vegetables, and use reservoirs to raise more than 1.4 million fish. In addition to being able to eat enough vegetables, all public mess halls in the county can also eat pork and fresh fish during busy farming seasons and festivals.

After taking the above active measures, the shortcomings in the work of the mess halls were overcome, and the appearance of the mess halls in the county was brand new. The number of well-run first-class mess halls in the county increased from 59 to 146, and the number of poorer third-class mess halls decreased from 103 to 53.

Because the public mess halls meet the needs of the masses, they are welcomed by the broad masses of commune members, especially the working women. Commune members posted big-character posters one after another, praising the mess halls with their own personal experiences. Someone said, "The mess hall is well run, I won't leave even if you drag me."

The establishment of mess halls has liberated more than 9,000 female laborers from housework throughout the county. They have gone from the kitchen to the fields, learned the skills of plowing, harrowing, and transplanting rice, and played an important role in production. The solution of female labor and the increase of male labor have promoted the overall development of mountain production. This year, the area of single-season late rice in Zixi County has expanded from 40,000 mu last year to 56,000 mu, an increase of 45%; soybeans have expanded by 55%; cotton has expanded from 300 mu of trial planting last year to 950 mu. The unit area yield of early rice increased by 37% compared with last year; rapeseed increased by more than 90%. Industry has grown from nothing, and the total industrial output value in the first half of this year reached 1.94 million yuan; sideline production was 730,000 yuan, an increase of more than four times compared with last year.

Chengdu, September 8th (report from this newspaper) -- The mess halls of the Red Flag District United Team of the Red Flag People's Commune in Pengxi County, Sichuan Province, saved a total of 300,000 jin of grain in two months in the spirit of "small streams flow forever" and "looking ahead and behind". At present, the commune members of each mess hall have also formulated a plan to save grain for this winter and next spring. From August to February next year, it is estimated that each person can save an average of 40 jin of raw grain, and the entire team will save more than 300,000 jin.

This united team has more than 8,500 people and 92 mess halls. Before June, the average daily ration standard per person was one jin of raw grain. Because the principle of "savings returned to oneself" was not seriously implemented, the enthusiasm of commune members to save grain was not high. Individual mess halls even exceeded the ration standard. After the party branch secretary and the branch secretaries of the seven districts went deep into each mess hall and discovered these situations, they immediately studied with the masses and clearly stipulated that all mess halls should eat by ticket, and the cook should fill in the amount of grain eaten on the meal ticket for each household for each meal; the grain saved by the commune members should be owned by the commune members themselves, and settled every five days, and what was saved was returned to the commune members, etc.

After in-depth discussion on the significance of saving grain, the broad masses of commune members, based on the methods of eating dry food during busy farming seasons, eating porridge during slack farming seasons, matching coarse and fine grains, and mixing vegetables, have formulated plans to save grain. In order to save more refined grains, the mess halls have also planted a large number of vegetables to ensure that each person can eat three jin of fresh vegetables every day. The eight mess halls of Zhongqingzhi Brigade ate more than 40,000 jin of vegetables in one month by mixing vegetables in fine grains, saving more than 10,700 jin of fine grains. All of these saved grains are owned by the commune members themselves.

Under the principle of managing production and managing life well, each branch has a mess hall experimental field, constantly summing up experience, and then universally promoting it. If there is a problem with that mess hall, the branch secretary will go there to solve the problem. In order to further run the mess halls well and save grain, in addition to regularly strengthening education on thrift and diligence and saving for commune members, the Party branch has also strengthened the political work of cooks. In June, the entire team selected 160 excellent cooks who were diligent and thrifty in running meals; at the same time, impure elements mixed into the mess hall work were removed, and incompetent cooks were re-elected. Each district team also held a cook meeting every ten days to summarize and check work and exchange experiences. Therefore, the cooks of each mess hall love the work of the mess hall, and they are working hard to make every commune member satisfied. (Attached picture)

    积极办好食堂　群众自愿参加
    江西资溪县委从多方面加强具体领导，全县食堂日益巩固
    四川蓬溪县红旗区联队各食堂两个月节约粮食三十万斤
    今年夏收以后，各地方采取了粮食分配到户、各人自愿参加、口粮依人定量、节余全部归己等办法，就使大多数的食堂巩固起来了。我们认为，对食堂只要采取积极办好、自愿参加的原则，就可以达到便利生产、便利群众的目的，广大劳动群众是会热烈拥护的。
      ——摘自周恩来总理8月26日在人大常委会全体会议上的报告
    本报南昌8日电　中共江西资溪县委积极加强对人民公社食堂的领导，不断与右倾思想作斗争，使全县三百五十四个食堂全部巩固了下来。
    资溪县是个山区，地广人稀、劳力不足。去年夏季“双抢”运动中，创办了一百二十多个农忙食堂。公社化后，发展成了二百九十一个常年性食堂。以后，根据山区村落分散的特点，又调整为现在的三百五十四个。全县农村99％以上的人口都在食堂吃饭。
    加强党的领导、贯彻群众自愿的原则和大力发展多种经营、逐步改善社员生活，是资溪县各人民公社公共食堂得到巩固提高的主要原因。
    去年，开始大规模办食堂的时候，少数干部看不清公共食堂对大跃进的促进作用，错误地认为摊子大、人多嘴众，既麻烦又复杂，不好领导，因而对食堂采取放任自流的消极态度。一些不法的坏分子也趁机造谣破坏。在这种情况下，中共资溪县委采取了坚决的态度和积极的措施。在今春整社期间，以第一书记为首，组织了十八名县委委员和一千多名整社干部，深入各食堂，从参加生产、组织生产入手，领导社员总结公共食堂的优越性和办好食堂的经验，广泛开展鸣放、辩论。这样，大大地提高了干部和社员的认识，树立了办好食堂的信心，批判了某些干部的右倾思想，有力地打击了坏人。接着，全县各公社、大队都确定了专人领导食堂，并抽调了一批党团员和积极分子到食堂担任管理员、炊事员，积极办好食堂。
    在贯彻自愿原则方面，各级党委经常登门访问群众，广泛征求社员意见。半年来，各级党委根据社员的意见，从以下几个方面改进了食堂工作：一、食堂的规模，以生产队或自然村为单位，把原来的二百九十一个食堂划分为三百五十四个；二、为照顾社员的传统习惯，采取了自备桌凳，一户一席的办法，做到了便于照顾孩子和全家团聚；三、社员的口粮，采取了以人定量、以户计算、分配到户、节约归己的办法，病号和产妇可以领粮回家做饭；四、社员交一百斤口粮（稻谷）可向食堂领回十五斤左右的细糠，作为私人养猪饲料。其他在菜饭品种、茶水供应、人来客往等方面，也都根据社员的意见和要求合理处理。
    为了解决食堂的吃菜问题，全县各公共食堂都设立了饲养和蔬菜组。现在全县三百五十四个食堂共养生猪一万一千多头，家禽七万四千多只，种蔬菜三千七百八十亩，利用水库养鱼一百四十万多尾。全县各公共食堂平时除能吃到足够的蔬菜外，在农忙和节日还可以吃到猪肉和鲜鱼。
    采取以上积极措施后，克服了食堂工作中的缺点，全县食堂面貌一新。全县办得好的一类食堂，由五十九个增加到一百四十六个，较差的三类食堂由一百零三个减少为五十三个。
    由于公共食堂适合群众的需要，受到了广大社员的欢迎，特别是劳动妇女的热烈欢迎。社员们纷纷贴出大字报，以自己的亲身体会赞扬食堂。有人说：“食堂办得好，拖我也不走。”
    兴办了食堂，使全县从家务琐事中解放出来的妇女劳动力达九千多名。她们由厨房走向田间，学会了犁田、耙田和插秧技术，在生产中发挥了重要作用。妇女劳动力的解决，男劳动力的增加，促进了山区生产的全面发展。今年，资溪县一季晚稻面积由去年的四万亩扩大为五万六千亩，扩大45％；大豆扩大55％；棉花由去年试种的三百亩扩大为九百五十亩。早稻单位面积产量比去年增长37％；油菜增长90％以上。工业由无到有，今年上半年的工业总产值达一百九十四万元；副业生产七十三万元，比去年增长四倍以上。
    本报成都8日电　四川省蓬溪县红旗人民公社红旗区联队各食堂，本着细水长流，瞻前顾后的精神，在两个月中共节约粮食三十万斤。目前各食堂的社员又订出了今冬明春的节约吃粮计划，从8月到明年2月，预计每人平均可节约原粮四十斤，全队节约三十多万斤。
    这个联队共有八千五百多人，九十二个食堂。6月份以前每人每日平均吃粮定量标准为原粮一斤，由于没有认真执行“节约归己”的原则，社员节约粮食的积极性不高。个别食堂还超出吃粮定量标准。党总支书记和七个区的支部书记分别深入各个食堂发现这些情况后，立即同群众研究，明确规定各食堂都要凭票吃饭，炊事员按每户每顿在饭票上填的吃粮数量下锅；社员节约的粮食为社员个人所有，五天一结账，节约什么退给社员什么等制度。
  广大社员在深入讨论节约粮食的意义后，根据农忙吃干，农闲吃稀，粗细搭配，掺吃蔬菜的办法，纷纷订出节约吃粮计划。为了多节约细粮，各食堂又大量栽种蔬菜，保证每人每天能吃到三斤鲜菜。钟庆植大队八个食堂，在细粮中搭配蔬菜，一月吃了四万多斤蔬菜，节约细粮一万零七百多斤。这些节约出来的粮食，全部都归社员个人所有。
    在管好生产又管好生活的原则下，每个支部都有一个食堂试验田，不断总结经验，然后普遍推广，那个食堂有问题，支部书记就去那里解决问题。为了进一步办好食堂，节约粮食，党支部除了经常对社员加强俭勤节约教育外，还特别加强了对炊事员的政治工作。6月份全队评选出一百六十个勤俭办伙食的优秀炊事员；同时撤销了混入食堂工作的不纯分子，改选了不称职的炊事员。各个区队还每十天召开一次炊事员会议，总结检查工作，交流经验。因此，各食堂的炊事员都热爱食堂工作，他们大鼓干劲，要使社员个个满意。（附图片）
