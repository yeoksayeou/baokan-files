The great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule has inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country. The national coal mine workers, who had already left Britain far behind in 1958, are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee with redoubled efforts and practical actions. More than 200,000 coal mine workers in Hebei Province have launched a coal-grabbing campaign, and their output has risen sharply in recent days. On August 30, the province's daily coal output reached 115,368 tons, an increase of 29% compared with the province's average daily output in the first and middle ten days of August. The Kailuan Coal Mine in this province, with 60,000 workers, pledged to the Party at a mobilization meeting on the 28th that it would increase the production of raw coal by 250,000 tons throughout the year. After hearing the call of the Party Central Committee, the 60,000 workers in the Fuxin Mining Area of Liaoning Province decided to complete the plan to produce 17.1 million tons of coal this year 15 days ahead of schedule, and then increase the production of coal by 900,000 tons by the end of the year. Fushun coal mines decided to increase production by another 700,000 tons of coal. The three major coal mines in Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang Province launched a coal-grabbing campaign. The workers of the six major coal mines in Datong and Yangquan in Shanxi Province also actively participated in the fiery coal-grabbing struggle. More than 50,000 workers in the Datong Coal Mine decided to increase the average daily output in September from 32,000 tons at the end of August to 35,000 tons, and complete the September task two days ahead of schedule. The Pingdingshan Coal Mine in Henan Province will respond to the Party's call by completing the September production plan five days ahead of schedule. These situations show that the coal mine workers across the country are launching a great upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy.

China's coal industry has made unprecedented and huge developments in 1958. In the past year, the country's coal output jumped from 130 million tons to 270 million tons, an increase of more than doubled. The road that the United States took fourteen years to complete, and Britain took thirty-two years to complete—the annual output increased from 130 million tons to 270 million tons, we only took one year to complete. And the actual output of coal in Britain in 1958 was only about 220 million tons, which has fallen far behind our country. The task of catching up with Britain in coal has been solved. This year, the coal industry continues to advance at a high speed. From January to August, it has produced more than 220 million tons of coal, equivalent to 178% of the same period last year. The huge leap forward in the coal industry fully demonstrates the correctness of the Party's General Line, the mass movement, and a set of "walking on two legs" policies. Last year's mass movement of great steelmaking not only promoted the great development of the steel industry, but also promoted the great development of the coal industry. In just a few months, millions of people rose up to find and mine coal, which played a huge role in the general survey of coal resources and in solving the industrial and civilian coal needs of the local areas.

Now, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC has adjusted this year's coal production plan to 335 million tons. This is a plan for continued leap forward. According to this plan, this year's coal output will increase by 24% compared with last year, which is 9.5% faster than the average annual growth rate of 14.5% during the First Five-Year Plan. The absolute number of increased production in one year this year will be more than 1 million tons more than the total output of 63.51 million tons increased during the First Five-Year Plan. In 1942, the year with the highest coal output in my country before liberation, the annual output was 61.88 million tons; in 1949, the year of the liberation, the output was 32.43 million tons; after three years of restoration, in 1952, before the start of the First Five-Year Plan, the output was 66.49 million tons. That is to say, the 65 million tons of coal newly produced in my country this year will be equal to 105% of the highest annual output before liberation, more than twice the total output in 1949, and almost equal to the total coal output in 1952—the year before the start of the First Five-Year Plan.

The task before the staff and workers of the coal industry sector is: we must continue to go all out, complete and overfulfill the plan of producing 335 million tons of coal this year decided by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC ahead of schedule, and ensure the overall leap forward of all sectors of the national economy. Winter is approaching, and the demand for civilian coal nationwide in the fourth quarter of this year will increase by tens of millions of tons. At the same time, the fourth quarter is the busiest and most tense season for railway transportation. As the largest cargo owner of the railway sector, the coal industry sector must increase the production of more coal in September and October to reduce the burden of railway winter transportation and ensure that coal is transported out in time and supply the needs of various sectors this year.

Is it possible to complete the target of 335 million tons of coal ahead of schedule? It is entirely possible. The key lies in thoroughly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and unswervingly carrying out mass movements. In June this year, a few cadres in the coal industry sector with conservative thinking saw that after the large-scale bumper harvest red flag movement was launched in coal mines across the country, a few mines had the situation that tunneling lagged behind coal mining. At the same time, there were also difficulties in the supply of materials and equipment to a certain extent. They only emphasized these negative factors, and did not see the favorable conditions and the strength of the masses, and held pessimistic attitudes and took negative methods on how to strengthen the work of back mining and tunneling. The enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses was not supported. As a result, the output of some coal mines in June and the first half of July declined, and tunneling was not able to keep up. In July, according to the spirit of the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the coal industry sector promptly corrected this right-leaning conservative tendency, firmly believed in the strength of the masses, and re-sounded the gongs and drums of the large-scale bumper harvest. As a result, a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy was quickly formed in the coal enterprises across the country, and the output increased day by day, ten days by ten days, and month by month. By the end of August, the daily output of 140 large-scale coal mines across the country had exceeded 590,000 tons. The number of coal mining faces with a monthly output of 10,000 tons increased by 41 in July compared with June. At the same time, tunneling work was also strengthened, and many provinces and enterprises have seen a situation of double leap forward in coal mining and tunneling. This fact eloquently proves that as long as we firmly rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and go all out, it is entirely possible to complete the production plan for this year ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.

In order to complete the plan of producing 335 million tons of coal this year ahead of schedule, the average daily output of coal nationwide in the next four months must exceed 923,000 tons, that is, it must increase by more than 8.59% compared with the level in August. This requires first of all that the main force of the coal industry—the large-scale coal mines across the country—further carry out the large-scale bumper harvest red flag movement, and vigorously promote the advanced experience that has now been summarized in raw coal production. The broad masses of coal industry workers are inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, their fighting spirit is even more high, and a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy is in full swing. Leading cadres of various coal mining enterprises must carry forward the excellent leadership style formed in the great leap forward last year, go down the mine to fight with the masses, and strengthen enterprise management work, so as to more widely and deeply carry out the mass movement of large-scale bumper harvest and achieve greater success.

The small and medium-sized coal mines operated by the local authorities are a very important force. In the total coal output of the country in the next four months, the output of local coal mines accounts for more than one-third; especially the local industrial and civilian coal, whose demand will increase greatly in the fourth quarter, is mainly supplied by local coal mines. Therefore, the staff and workers of local coal mines must seize the time in the next four months to actively increase production. The conditions in the next four months are very favorable for the production of local coal mines: the rainy season is over, and there are fewer natural obstacles; especially after September, the busy farming season is over, and people's communes in various places can transfer a group of agricultural labor to the industrial front. In October, November, and December, we can do a big job in a vigorous manner. In the production of local coal mines, the most important link is short-distance transportation. From September, various regions should start to organize a mass movement for short-distance transportation.

In addition to the existing coal mines making efforts to increase production, the basic construction workers in the coal industry sector must also strive to accelerate the speed of basic construction, and strive to deliver more new wells for production ahead of schedule; the staff and workers who are responsible for tunneling and stripping in the production mines must strive to accelerate the tunneling and stripping speed, and strive to provide more new minable areas. We must strive to increase 200 to 300 new coal mining faces in the next four months. Calculating at a monthly output of 7,000 tons per working face, this item alone can increase the production of 5.6 million to 8.4 million tons of coal.

The working conditions of coal industry workers are relatively arduous. In the current movement to increase production and practice economy, the leading cadres of enterprises must be very concerned about the lives of the masses, attach importance to safe production, and ensure that the masses still achieve "work and rest" in the hard work and always maintain a strong fighting capacity.

All the staff and workers in the coal sector, hold the banner of the General Line even higher, make persistent efforts, increase the output and quality of coal, and strive to achieve more coal mining faces with a monthly output of 10,000 tons, and bravely advance to complete the coal production plan for this year ahead of schedule and overfulfill it.

    要生产更多的煤
    党的八届八中全会提出的提前三年完成第二个五年计划主要指标的伟大号召，鼓舞了全国人民的革命干劲。已经在1958年就把英国远远抛在后面的全国煤矿职工，正以百倍的干劲和实际行动响应党中央的号召。河北省二十多万煤矿职工展开了夺煤大战，连日来产量急剧上升，8月30日全省煤炭日产量达十一万五千三百六十八吨，比8月上、中旬全省平均日产量提高了29％。这个省的开滦煤矿六万职工，在28日的誓师大会上向党保证，全年要增产原煤二十五万吨。辽宁省的阜新矿区六万职工听到党中央的号召后，决定提前十五天完成今年产煤一千七百一十万吨的计划，到年底再增产九十万吨煤炭。抚顺各煤矿决定再增产七十万吨煤。黑龙江鹤岗、鸡西、双鸭山三大煤矿展开了夺煤大战。山西省的大同、阳泉等六大煤矿职工，也积极投入了火热的夺煤斗争。大同煤矿的五万多名职工，决定要把9月份的平均日产水平由8月底的三万二千吨提高到三万五千吨，提前两天完成9月份的任务。河南平顶山煤矿要以提前五天完成9月份生产计划来响应党的号召。这些情况显示：全国煤矿职工们正在掀起一个增产节约的大高潮。
    我国的煤炭工业在1958年有了空前巨大的发展。去年一年中，全国的煤炭产量从一亿三千万吨一跃而为二亿七千万吨，增长了一倍以上。美国用十四年时间，英国用三十二年的时间走完的路程——年产量从一亿三千万吨增长到二亿七千万吨，我们只用一年就走完了。而1958年英国煤炭的实际产量只有二亿二千万吨左右，已远远落在我国的后面。在煤炭方面赶上英国的任务已经解决了。今年，煤炭工业继续以高速度前进，1月至8月已经生产了二亿二千多万吨煤，相当于去年同期的178％。煤炭工业这个巨大的跃进，充分说明了党的总路线、大搞群众运动和一套“两条腿走路”的方针的正确。去年的大炼钢铁的群众运动，不仅促进了钢铁工业的大发展，而且促进了煤炭工业的大发展。在短短的几个月里，千百万群众起来找煤挖煤，对煤炭资源的普查，对解决地方的工业用煤和民用煤起了极大的作用。
    现在，中共八中全会已经调整了今年煤炭的生产计划为三亿三千五百万吨。这是一个继续跃进的计划。按照这个计划，今年的煤炭产量将比去年增长24％，比第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长的速度14.5％快9.5％。今年一年增产的绝对数，将比第一个五年计划期间五年总共增加的产量六千三百五十一万吨还要多一百多万吨。解放前我国煤炭产量最高的1942年，全年产量是六千一百八十八万吨；刚解放的1949年，产量是三千二百四十三万吨；经过三年的恢复，到第一个五年计划开始前的1952年，产量是六千六百四十九万吨。也就是说，今年一年我国新增产的煤炭——六千五百万吨，将等于解放前最高年产量的105％，等于1949年全年产量的二倍多，而且差不多等于1952年——第一个五年计划开始前一年的全年煤产量。
    摆在煤炭工业部门职工面前的任务是：必须继续鼓足干劲，提前完成和超额完成中共八中全会决定的今年生产三亿三千五百万吨煤的计划，保证国民经济各部门的全面跃进。冬天即将到来，今年第四季度全国民用煤的需要量将要增加几千万吨。同时，第四季度是铁路运输最繁重最紧张的季节，作为铁路部门最大的货主的煤炭工业部门，必须在9、10两月增产更多的煤，才能减轻铁路冬季运输的负担，保证及时把煤运出来，及时供应各部门今年的需要。
    提前完成三亿三千五百万吨煤的指标，有没有可能呢？完全是可能的。关键在于要彻底克服右倾保守思想，坚定不移地大搞群众运动。今年6月，煤炭工业部门中少数有保守思想的干部，看到全国煤矿在大面积丰产红旗运动开展起来以后，有少数矿井产生了掘进落后于采煤的情况，同时材料设备供应工作也存在着一定程度的困难。他们只强调这些消极的因素，看不到有利条件和群众的力量，对如何加强回采和掘进工作，抱着悲观的态度和采取了消极的方法。广大干部和群众的积极性没有得到支持，结果有些煤矿6月份和7月上半月的产量下降了，掘进也没有能够跟上去。7月，煤炭工业部门根据党中央指示的精神，及时纠正了这种右倾保守倾向，坚决相信群众的力量，重新把大面积丰产的锣鼓敲响，结果，在全国的煤炭企业中迅速形成了一个增产节约的新高潮，产量逐日逐旬逐月地上升，到8月下旬，全国一百四十个大型煤矿的日产量已经超过了五十九万吨。月产万吨的采煤工作面，7月份比6月份增加了四十一个。同时，掘进工作也加强了，许多省份和企业都出现了采煤、掘进双跃进的局面。这个事实雄辩地证明了：只要坚决地依靠群众、发动群众，把干劲鼓足，提前和超额完成今年的生产计划，是完全可以做到的。
    为了提前完成今年生产三亿三千五百万吨煤的计划，今后四个月全国煤炭的平均日产量必须超过九十二万三千吨以上，即比8月份的水平要提高8.59％以上。这就首先要求煤炭工业的主力军——全国的大型煤矿，把大面积丰产红旗运动进一步开展起来，在原煤生产方面，现在已经总结出的先进经验，要大力推广。广大的煤炭工业职工受到中共八届八中全会决议的鼓舞，斗志更加昂扬，增产节约新高潮正在方兴未艾。各个煤矿企业的领导干部，要发扬去年大跃进中形成的优良的领导作风，到井下去同群众一起战斗，并且加强企业管理工作，以便把大面积丰产的群众运动更加广泛、深入地开展起来，取得更大的成就。
    地方经营的中小型煤矿是一支十分重要的力量。在今后四个月全国煤炭的总产量中，地方煤矿的产量占三分之一以上；特别是第四季度需要量大大增长的地方工业用煤和民用煤，主要地要由地方煤矿来供应。因此，地方煤矿的职工必须抓紧今后四个月的时间来积极增产，今后四个月的条件对地方煤矿的生产十分有利：雨季过去了，自然的障碍少了；特别是9月以后，农忙季节已过，各地人民公社可以抽调一批农业劳动力到工业战线上来，10、11、12三个月，可以轰轰烈烈地大干一场。在地方煤矿的生产中，最重要的一环是短途运输。从9月份起，各个地区就要开始组织短途运输的群众运动。
    除了现有的煤矿要努力增产之外，煤炭工业部门中的基本建设职工还要努力加快基本建设的速度，争取把更多的新井提前交付生产；在生产矿山中担负掘进和剥离工作的职工，要努力加快掘进和剥离速度，争取提供更多的新的可采面积。我们要争取在今后四个月内增加二百到三百个新的采煤工作面。以每个工作面月产七千吨计算，仅此一项，就可以增产五百六十万到八百四十万吨煤。
    煤炭工业职工的劳动条件是比较艰苦的，在目前的增产节约运动中，企业领导干部必须十分关怀群众的生活，重视安全生产，要使群众在苦战中仍然做到“有劳有逸”，始终保持旺盛的战斗力。
    煤炭部门的全体职工们，更高地举起总路线的旗帜，再接再厉，提高煤炭的产量和质量，争取实现更多的月产万吨的采煤工作面，为提前和超额完成今年的煤炭生产计划奋勇前进。
