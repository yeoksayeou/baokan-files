    Men's Basketball Decides Championship Battle
    By our reporters Lu Zuohua, Yi Xintian

    On the evening of the 27th, the Beijing Velodrome was packed with over six thousand spectators, as the final battle for the National Games men's basketball championship began. Who would be the champion? Who would get second and third place? This would be decided by the match between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and Beijing.

    After one hundred and thirty-one men's basketball games, a very delicate situation emerged: Sichuan with ten wins out of eleven games, the PLA with nine wins out of ten, and Beijing with eight wins out of ten. The top three teams' rankings would be decided in the final game. The PLA had already defeated Sichuan, and if they defeated Beijing again, they would be champions, Sichuan would be second, and Beijing third; if they lost to Beijing, they would be relegated to third place, with Sichuan taking the championship and Beijing second. Therefore, this game aroused great interest among the audience, who whispered to each other, speculated, and watched the fierce battle between the two sides with full attention.

    The PLA and Beijing men's basketball teams, both strong and evenly matched, are old rivals. At the start of the game, both sides faced each other sternly. The PLA sent out renowned players Ma Qingsheng, Han Zidong, Yu Qingquan, Zhang Dexin, and Fang Ronghua, while Beijing fielded its main players Ju Fenkan, Wang Yicheng, Zhang Guanglie, He Shisun, and Yang Zhiming. After the jump ball in the center circle, the PLA's Han Zidong got the ball and made a layup, scoring two points. Beijing's Ju Fenkan cut into the basket, resulting in the first tie. After that, both sides played solid defense and steady positional attacks, with gains and losses for each side, forming a back-and-forth battle. The scores were very close, and ties occurred repeatedly. The applause from the audience rose and fell continuously. At ten minutes, the score was fifteen to fifteen, the seventh tie. At fifteen minutes, the ninth tie: nineteen all. The PLA's Li Huigang and Yu Qingquan each scored three goals, while Beijing's Wang Yicheng and He Shisun also scored repeatedly. The first half ended with Beijing leading twenty-eight to twenty-seven.

    In the second half, the PLA's Li Huigang, who is 1.95 meters tall, was frequently active under Beijing's basket. He not only controlled the rebounds, but also shot accurately. Other players controlled the ball outside and passed it to him when he entered the basket to shoot. In the first eighteen minutes, they scored a total of twenty-seven points through shots and free throws, equal to their score in the first half. The Beijing team adopted an offensive strategy through the center, and Liu Erzhu played smoothly with the support of Ju Fenkan, scoring three goals in five minutes. For a time, Li Huigang and him scored alternately, and the score increased for both sides. However, Liu Erzhu was penalized for five fouls and was sent off. At twelve minutes, the Beijing team was already seven points behind. At this point, the Beijing team changed its center coordination tactics, with Ju Fenkan directly shooting and scoring under the basket. In the last three minutes, they narrowed the gap to sixty-one to fifty-eight, still three points behind. The Beijing team then switched to full-court press. Wang Yicheng and Ju Fenkan were very active, continuously dribbling and scoring, and the score gradually rose, exceeding the PLA's score at sixty-six to sixty-three. Until the final buzzer sounded, they maintained this lead, winning by those precious three points. At this time, the audience applauded enthusiastically, congratulating the rising star Sichuan team on winning the championship, while the battle-tested Beijing and PLA teams won second and third place respectively.

    Before the men's basketball game, the Beijing women's basketball team played against the PLA women's basketball team. The Beijing women's basketball team won seventy to forty-two, maintaining an undefeated record of eleven wins out of eleven games, and winning the championship.

    男篮决定冠军之战
    本报记者　陆佐华　伊心恬
    27日晚上，北京自行车赛车场坐满了六千多观众，全运会男篮决赛的最后一战开始了。谁是冠军？谁得第二和第三？就要由解放军对北京这场球赛来决定。
    男篮经过一百三十一场的比赛，出现了十分微妙的局势：四川十一战十胜，解放军十战九胜，北京十战八胜，这三队前三名的名次要待最后一场才能决定。解放军已胜四川，要是再胜北京，就是冠军，四川第二，北京第三；要是败于北京，就要退居第三，而由四川坐得冠军，北京第二。因此，这场球赛引起了观众的极大兴趣，人们交头接耳，纷纷猜测，全神贯注地观看双方激战。
    实力雄厚、旗鼓相当的解放军和北京男篮，是老对手了。比赛一开始，双方就严阵相对。解放军队调名将马清盛、韩子栋、于庆全、张德鑫、方荣华上阵，北京以主力鞠汾康、王忆诚、张光烈、何诗孙、杨志明出马。中圈跳球后，解放军韩子栋得球上篮，投中两分，北京鞠汾康切入篮下，首次平局。此后双方联防固守，稳打阵地战，互有得失，形成拉锯战，比分十分相近，平局一再出现，观众掌声刚落又起。到十分钟时，场上比分十五对十五，出现第七次平局，十五分钟第九次平局：十九平。解放军李惠刚、于庆全各中三球，北京王忆诚、何诗孙也连连得分，上半场以二十八比二十七结束，北京领先。
    下半场，解放军队身高一米九五的李惠刚经常活动在北京队的篮下，他不仅控制了篮板球，而且投篮准确。其他的队员控制在外围传球，等他进入篮下马上投篮，在前十八分钟内连投带罚，他们一共获得二十七分，等于上半场的比分。北京队采取通过中锋进行进攻，刘二柱得到鞠汾康的接济，打得很顺手，五分钟内就投进三球，一时同李惠刚你一球我一球，场上比分互有增长。可是不久刘二柱犯规五次被罚下，到十二分钟时，北京队已落后七分。这时北京队改变中锋策应战术，鞠汾康直接在篮下投球得分，到最后三分钟扳到六十一比五十八，还落后三分。北京队又改全场紧逼，王忆诚、鞠汾康十分活跃，连续带球上篮得分，比数步步上升，反以六十六比六十三超出，直到最后铜锣敲响，仍保持住赢得这宝贵的三分。这时观众热烈鼓掌欢呼，祝贺后起之秀的四川队荣获冠军，身经百战的北京队和解放军队分别得第二和第三名。
    男篮比赛之前，北京女篮和解放军女篮作战，北京女篮以七十比四十二胜，保持十一战十一胜的不败纪录，夺得冠军。
