The golden rice is ripening, and the autumn harvest is in sight. The vast members of the People's Communes are enthusiastically responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee and are preparing to show their skills in the autumn harvest battle. Currently, most autumn-harvested crops are growing well, maturing one after another, and are ready for harvesting. The autumn harvest is the final stage in striving for a full-year agricultural bumper harvest. Successfully passing this stage, ensuring a ten-tenth year with a ten-tenth harvest, means that the fruits of a year's hard work are truly in hand, the continued leap forward plan for this year can be smoothly completed, and it will also promote the great development of agriculture next year. Therefore, all regions should continue to strengthen field management in the later stages and must fully prepare for the autumn harvest, ensuring good cutting, good harvesting, good threshing, and good storage.
	This year's autumn harvest crops were planted in a timely manner and are growing vigorously. In drought-stricken areas, the ripening time is generally earlier and more concentrated. Therefore, harvesting must be timely, harvesting as soon as it ripens. Any delay will result in grain shattering and ear dropping. For crops that are easily scattered, such as rice and beans, it is also necessary to harvest when they are nine-tenths yellow, to avoid scattering. Of course, harvesting must be timely. If it is too early, the crops will not be truly mature, the grains will not be full, and the harvest will also be affected. We must harvest not only grain but also peanuts, cotton, potatoes, and other crops, without allowing any crop to be lost. Some crops, such as sugarcane and sugar beets, should be processed in a timely manner after harvesting to avoid spoilage. In northern regions, cultivation and breeding should also be strengthened to promote early maturity of crops and avoid early frost damage. At present, under the encouragement of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session, the vast rural cadres and commune members are extensively carrying out the movement to increase production and are actively preparing for the autumn harvest. However, some people still have a sense of麻痹or a fear of difficulties. Some believe that this year's summer harvest has been done very carefully, and various disasters have been overcome, so a bumper harvest is not a problem, thus relaxing preparations for the autumn harvest. Others believe that no matter how carefully the crops are harvested, some scattering is inevitable. This kind of thinking is very harmful and must be thoroughly corrected. It is clearly wrong to have this kind of thinking. Just imagine, if we do not thresh and harvest meticulously, and every mu (unit of area) in the country wastes one jin (unit of weight), then we will lose one to two billion jin, which is an astonishing figure. Is scattering really unavoidable? In the past, during the small-scale peasant economy, individual households managed their own land. They were weak and helpless, and could not attend to everything. Scattering and spoilage were indeed unavoidable. But today, with the superior social organization of the People's Commune, as long as we strengthen leadership and rationally organize manpower and resources, we can completely harvest as soon as it ripens, thresh and dry it in a timely manner, and avoid losses from scattering and spoilage. If there are dropped stalks or ears, we can organize people to pick them up. If it is not thoroughly threshed the first time, we can organize a second threshing to ensure that every grain is stored in the granary. When Sichuan Province harvested mid-season rice, many counties established commands for meticulous harvesting and threshing, proposing the slogan of increasing production in the fields, threshing barrels, and drying grounds. To achieve this requirement, they added canopies, enclosures, and bamboo nets to the threshing barrels to reduce scattering, and organized thousands of children to pick up rice grains. In Wusheng County, more than 19,000 children picked up more than 87,000 jin of rice in seven days. In Damin Tun Team of Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, after re-harvesting 51 mu of summer potatoes, they harvested an additional 22,500 jin, an increase of 400 jin per mu. These facts prove that as long as we give full play to the superiority of the People's Commune and fully mobilize and organize, scattering and waste can and should be avoided.
	Reasonably arranging labor, organizing cooperation, and supporting each other are important links in doing a good job in the autumn harvest. In this year's autumn harvest, the People's Communes must further strengthen unified leadership, and organize large-scale cooperation and large-scale operations when necessary, in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit. Under the conditions of heavy tasks and urgent time, large-scale cooperation and large-scale operations are the most effective ways to solve problems. Of course, while organizing large-scale cooperation and large-scale operations, we must also establish and improve the production responsibility system. The combination of the two will enable us to better leverage the role of cooperation. The experience in the summer harvest also proves that the harvesting and threshing were more meticulous in places where the responsibility system was established and strictly implemented, and more rough in places where it was not established or not strictly implemented. To this end, before the autumn harvest, the People's Communes and production teams must rank their autumn harvest crops according to the order of maturity by plot and variety. Harvest the early-maturing crops first, the late-maturing crops later, harvest one plot at a time, and determine the harvesting time and order for each plot. It is best to assign people to fields and contract for harvesting and threshing. In autumn harvest cooperation, cadres should inspect and accept each field and each crop, and the original work teams should be primarily responsible for inspecting the fields they manage to ensure the quality of the harvest.
	To do the autumn harvest quickly and well, we must also have sufficient farm tools. All regions should immediately conduct an inspection of farm tools used in harvesting, transporting, threshing, and processing during the autumn harvest. Repair what needs to be repaired, replenish what is missing, and immediately organize the promotion of new farm tools that need to be promoted. When inspecting, repairing, and replenishing farm tools, we must pay attention to both large and small tools, both new and old. Large farm tools, especially new farm tools, should be used, and small farm tools and old farm tools should also be used. While inspecting harvesting tools, we should also check whether there are enough sickles. While adding threshing machines, we should also check whether there are enough threshing barrels or 掼盆 (baskets for threshing). In this way, we can grasp both large and small, ensuring that everyone participating in the autumn harvest has suitable farm tools, and ensuring that there are enough farm tools in the fields to meet the needs of crop harvesting.
	In addition, we must also prepare sufficient drying grounds and warehouses, and have rainproof and drying equipment to ensure that we can harvest, thresh, dry, and winnow the crops as soon as they are harvested, and put them into storage at any time. In addition to expanding the drying grounds, Pucong Commune in Tonghai County, Yunnan Province, also dug drainage ditches next to the drying grounds to drain water after rain, and built one or two sheds next to the grounds to store grain during rain and at night to prevent rain and dew from soaking the grain. These methods do not require much work, and it is better to be prepared for contingencies. All regions can imitate them.
	To ensure a bumper harvest in the autumn, all relevant departments must provide strong support. For example, farm tool factories and handicraft cooperatives should currently focus on manufacturing autumn harvest tools, commercial departments should ensure the timely supply of autumn harvest materials, and government agencies, schools, and urban residents should prepare to actively support the autumn harvest. Only by fighting the autumn harvest battle well can we win a complete victory in this year's agricultural production. Party organizations and the vast rural cadres in all regions must implement political command, set up camps in the fields, personally participate in labor, lead all commune members, under the banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction, according to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, oppose right-leaning thoughts, boost greater energy, make good ideological preparations, properly organize labor and equip tools, strive for a ten-tenth year with a ten-tenth harvest, and ensure a bumper harvest!

    做好秋收准备　保证丰产丰收
    稻谷金黄，秋收在望，收获的季节就要到来。人民公社的广大社员热烈响应党的八中全会伟大号召，正准备在秋收大战中一显身手。目前大部秋收作物，生长良好，陆续成熟，正待收割。秋收是争取全年农业丰收的最后一关。过好这一关，保住十成年景十成收，一年紧张劳动的果实才算是真正到手，今年的继续跃进计划才能顺利完成，同时也将促进明年农业的大发展。因此，各地应当一面继续加强后期的田间管理，一面必须充分作好秋收的准备，做到割好、收好、打好、保管好。
    今年秋收作物，种植及时，生长齐茂，干旱地区成熟时间普遍提前而且比较集中。因此，收割必须及时，随熟随收，稍有迟缓便会炸粒掉穗。对于稻谷、豆类等容易抛撒的作物，还必须做到九黄十收，避免抛撒。当然，收割必须适时，太早了，庄稼没有真正成熟，颗粒不饱满，也会影响收成。要收好粮食，同时也要收好花生，棉花，薯类等，不使任何一种作物受到损失。有些作物如甘蔗、甜菜等收获以后，应当及时加工，避免霉烂。北方地区还要加工培育，促进作物早熟，避免早霜为害。现在，广大农村干部和社员正在八中全会精神鼓舞下广泛开展超产运动，积极做好秋收的准备工作。但是也有一些人还有麻痹思想或畏难情绪。有人认为，今年夏收已经做得很细致，又战胜了各种灾害，丰收是没有问题的了，因而放松了秋收的准备工作。也有人认为，庄稼收割再仔细，也难免要有些抛撒。这种思想是非常有害的，必须彻底纠正。存在这种思想显然是不对的。试想，如果不精打细收，全国每亩抛弃一斤，那就要损失一二十亿斤，这是多么惊人的数字。抛撒真的难免吗？在过去小农经济时期，单家独户经营自己的土地，势单力薄，顾此失彼，抛撒霉烂，的确是在所难免。但是今天有了人民公社这个优越的社会组织，只要我们加强领导，合理组织人力物力，完全可以做到随熟随收，及时打晒，避免抛撒霉烂的损失。如有丢棵掉穗，可以组织捡拾，一次打不干净的还能组织复打，保证粒粒归仓。四川省在收割中稻时，许多县都成立精收细打指挥部，提出田里、拌桶、晒场三增产的口号。为了实现这个要求，他们在拌桶上加篷、加围、加竹下兜以减少抛撒，并组织成千上万的儿童捡拾稻谷。武胜县一万九千多个儿童，七天内拾回稻谷八万七千多斤。辽宁省新民县大民屯一小队在五十一亩夏收土豆地内，经过复收，就多收了二万二千五百斤，每亩多收四百斤。这些事实证明，只要充分发挥人民公社的优越性，充分做好动员组织工作，抛撒浪费是完全可以而且应当避免的。
    合理安排劳力、组织协作，互相支援，是做好秋收工作的重要一环。今年秋收中，各人民公社必须进一步加强统一领导，按照等价互利的原则，在必要时组织大协作、大兵团作战。在任务繁重、时间紧迫的情况下，大协作、大兵团作战是最能解决问题的办法。当然，在组织大协作、大兵团作战的同时，还必须建立和健全生产责任制，两者互相结合，就能更好地发挥协作的作用。夏收中的经验也证明，凡是建立并严格执行责任制的地方，收打就比较细致，没有建立和执行不严的地方就比较粗糙。为此，各人民公社和生产队在秋收之前，必须对自己的秋收作物按地块和品种的成熟先后进行排队。先熟先收、后熟后收、熟一块收一块，应当确定每块地的收割时间和次序，最好做到人田对号，包收包打。在秋收协作中，干部对每一块田每一种作物都要检查验收，原作业小组对自己负责管理的田地要负主要的检查责任，保证收割质量。
    要想秋收工作做得又快又好，还必须有足够的农具。各地应立即对秋收中的收割、运输、脱粒、加工等农具进行一次检查，当修的修，当补的补，缺少的马上添置，需要推广的新农具立即组织推广。在检修添置农具时，必须注意大小兼顾、新旧并重。大农具特别是新式农具要利用，小农具和旧农具也要利用。在检修割禾器的同时，也要检查一下镰刀是否够用，在添置打谷机的时候，也要了解一下拌桶或掼盆是否够用。这样大小齐抓，保证每一个参加秋收的人都有适用的农具，保证田间都有足够的适合作物收获需要的农具。
    此外，对晒场、仓库等也要准备充足，并要有防雨和风干的设备，保证随收随打，晒干扬净，随时进仓。云南通海县普丛公社除扩大晒场外，还在晒场旁边挖好排水沟，以便雨后排涝，场旁搭盖草棚一两个，以备下雨时和夜间储存粮食，防止雨露浸淋。这些办法费工不多，有备无患，各地都可仿行。
    为了保证秋季丰产丰收，各有关部门都要大力支援。例如，农具厂和手工业社等目前应当全力突击制造秋收工具，商业部门要保证秋收物资的及时供应，机关、学校、城市居民都要准备踊跃支援秋收。只有把秋收这一仗打得好，我们才能获得今年农业生产的全胜。各地党组织和广大农村干部，要实行政治挂帅，田间扎营，亲自参加劳动，领导全体社员，在党的社会主义建设总路线的旗帜下，根据党的八届八中全会的精神，反对右倾思想，鼓起更大干劲，作好思想准备，妥善地组织劳动力和配备工具，力争十成年景十成收获，确保丰产又丰收！
