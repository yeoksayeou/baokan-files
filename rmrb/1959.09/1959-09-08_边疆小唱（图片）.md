Borderland Ballads
Yu Feng (Poetry and Painting)
      Little Pine Tree
    Little pine tree, young in age,
    Swaying in the wind on the mountain top,
    Hello, little pine tree!
    In this faraway, faraway borderland,
    Please send my greetings
    To the road patrollers on the border line.
    Weaving tube skirts, pomegranate flowers are red and delicate,
    Jingpo sister-in-law's craftsmanship is clever:
    Wool is twisted into fine yarn,
    Weave a bright red tube skirt and embroider flowers.
    This is spring after the harvest,
    The peacock also puts on new feathers.
    Little girls learn carefully,
    Learning wisdom and diligence:
    Mom's hard days will never come again,
    A happy life depends on me to create,
    Bamboo shuttles will be replaced by machines,
    How many beautiful patterns will be woven!
    An Old Man's Song
    The bitter olive fruit is most thirst-quenching,
    Please listen to an old man's song:
    Ten years ago, in our village,
    The land was like clothes torn by wild beasts.
    In the dark night, set a wildfire on the barren mountain,
    Streaks of fire dragons stretch in all directions,
    This is the only color in life,
              The brightest light!
    To escape the poisonous punishments of mountain officials and chieftains,
    Take the children, the cooking pot, and the baskets on your back,
    Escape into these deep mountains, cut the ground with knives,
              Grow grain with fire!
    But look, my child picks up a hoe,
    That little appearance is even more beautiful than carrying a long knife!
    Learned to plow the fields,
    Also learned to write his own name on the pages of a book.
    Jingpo, Benglong, and Lisu youths,
    All live in this half-farming and half-studying school in the deep mountains.
    The children sow vegetable seeds for the first time,
    Let the fragrant soil hide the seeds,
    Just like in a careful field, solemnly
                  Planting hope!
    Because they themselves are seeds,
    About to blossom in their hometown villages.
    What wind blows the green seedlings into the deep mountains,
    And who will cultivate these seedlings of hope?
    Is it the gods or the sun shining on the earth?
                It is the Communist Party!

    边疆小唱
    郁风　诗画
      小松树
    小小的松树年纪青，
    迎风摇曳在高山顶，
    你好啊，小松树！
    在这遥远遥远的边疆，
    请替我问候
    那国境线上的护路人。
    织筒裙石榴花儿红得娇，
    景颇族嫂嫂手艺巧：
    羊毛搓成细绒线，
    织一条鲜红的筒裙把花挑。
    这是丰收后的春天啊，
    孔雀也换上新的羽毛。
    小小姑娘细心学，
    学习那智慧和勤劳：
    妈妈的苦日子不再来，
    幸福生活靠我来创造，
    竹梭要用机器来代替，
    美丽的花纹啊织多少！
    一个老年人的歌
    苦涩的橄榄果最解渴，
    请听一个老年人的歌：
    十年以前在我们这个山寨，
    土地像被野兽撕破的衣裳。
    黑夜里上荒山放一把野火，
    一条条火龙伸向四面八方，
    这就是生活里仅有的颜色，
              最亮的光！
    为了躲避山官土司的毒刑，
    把孩子、饭锅、背上箩筐，
    逃进这深山里，用刀砍地，
              用火种粮！
    可是看哪，我的孩子拿起锄头，
    那小样儿比挎上长刀还要漂亮！
    学会了用犁耕田，
    也学会了在书页里把自己的名字写上。
    景颇、崩龙、傈僳族的少男少女，
    都住进这深山里半耕半读的学堂。
    孩子们第一次播种菜子，
    让芳香的泥土把种子掩藏，
    就像在小心田里，庄严的
                  种下希望！
    因为他们自己也就是种子，
    将要开花在家乡的寨子上。
    什么风把绿苗儿吹进深山里，
    这希望的苗儿又靠谁来培养？
    是神灵还是普照大地的太阳？
                是共产党！
