    U.S. Shenanigans in the United Nations

    A few days ago, the Fourteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly once again discussed the issue of “China's Representation.” As in past sessions of the UN General Assembly, the United States routinely launched a vicious smear campaign and attack against China while discussing this issue, stubbornly opposing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. As for the outcome of the discussion, it was entirely expected. Since American imperialism still controls the majority in the United Nations, and since there are still some countries willing to follow the United States (including Britain, which, on the one hand, recognizes the People's Republic of China, and on the other hand, disregards basic international norms and actively helps the United States), it is not surprising that the Americans used their voting machine to pass the American proposal.
    No matter how many years the United States uses its control of the United Nations to deprive China of its legitimate rights, it will not harm the Chinese people one bit! No force in the world can stop the great leap forward of New China. Our cause has been thriving in the ten years since the founding of New China, and it will continue to thrive. The increasingly powerful socialist New China stands tall in the East, and its earth-shattering development and heroic efforts for world peace and the cause of human progress have won the sympathy and praise of peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world. Our friends are all over the world. The US policy of isolating New China by not recognizing and depriving China of its legitimate rights in the United Nations is absolutely doomed to fail.
    On the contrary, the United States' policy of obstructing China's restoration to its legitimate seat in the United Nations puts itself in an increasingly awkward position. Every time the United Nations General Assembly opens, the United States cannot help but feel frightened, fearing that the voting machine will one day fail. In addition to putting pressure on some countries, it has to personally come forward to slander China, replacing combat with abuse. But this approach only serves to expose the ugly face of American imperialism's hostility towards the Chinese people. At this session of the UN General Assembly, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, in order to defend the U.S.'s absurd position, went to great lengths to fabricate five major "crimes" against China: "aggression against Korea"; "committing atrocities against prisoners of war"; "violating the Korean Agreement"; "using force" to "seize Taiwan and Penghu", "bringing the shadow of war to the Far East"; and interfering in Laos, exerting "aggressive pressure" in Southeast Asia... In fact, why say so much? Any country in the world with even one of these would be bad enough. However, Robertson has blamed all five of these things, which the United States has done and is doing, on China. If the subject of those sentences in which Robertson cursed China were changed to the United States, it would be a fairly accurate speech. Since the United States has committed these crimes, then, according to Robertson's logic, shouldn't it be the United States itself that should get out of the United Nations?
    Robertson's curse also had an unintended effect. Not long ago, when Robertson left his position in the U.S. State Department, didn't many people in the United States and abroad believe that this was the beginning of a change in U.S. policy toward China? Now, things are very clear: whether the American boss puts Robertson in the State Department or in the United Nations, he is just a mouthpiece for American imperialism's anti-China policy.
    However, it is worth noting that the United States not only slanders and attacks China's peaceful foreign policy, but also frantically slanders and attacks China's internal affairs. U.S. Secretary of State Herter and Robertson both raised the so-called "Tibet issue" at the General Assembly, falsely claiming that China "brutally suppresses the basic human rights of the Tibetan people," "eliminates the Tibetan race," and implements "colonial tyranny," and so on. Herter also openly said that the Tibet issue "is of deep concern to the United Nations. Faced with such events, this organization must definitely and clearly state its opinion." According to Western newspapers, the representative of Ireland is showing up and engaging in dirty activities for the American conspiracy to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. The United States' attempt to impose the Tibet issue, which is purely China's internal affair, on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly is by no means accidental. As early as during the Second World War, American imperialism had already extended its aggressive claws into Tibet, China. It is no secret that the Tibetan rebel group has a direct line to the United States. Although the Tibetan rebellion has completely failed, it appears that they are still trying to continue the interference and attempt to use the facade of the United Nations once again to carry out various conspiracies against the Chinese people. But what will be the result? The Tibet issue is entirely China's internal affair. Neither the United States, nor Ireland, nor other governments that pursue America's hostile policy toward China, nor the United Nations manipulated by the United States, have any right to interfere, and they absolutely cannot interfere. The Tibetan compatriots, who have been liberated from the feudal serf system, together with the people of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country, are working hard to build their own happy new life, regardless of the enemy's curses. As for the United Nations, if it continues to allow the United States to use the United Nations banner to interfere in China's internal affairs and slander the Chinese people, then the United Nations, which has already been discredited by repeated pollution by the United States, will be even more despised by all fair-minded public opinion in the world. The clamor of those who follow the American lead will only further expose their own ugly faces, and there will be no other result.

### 美国在联合国的勾当

    美国在联合国的勾当
    前几天，第十四届联合国大会又一次讨论了“中国代表权”的问题。同过去几届联合国大会一样，美国照例在讨论这个问题的时候，对中国进行一番恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，顽固地反对恢复中国在联合国的合法席位。至于讨论的结果，那完全是意料之中的事。既然美帝国主义还操纵着联合国的多数，既然还有一些国家甘心追随美国（包括一方面承认了中华人民共和国，一方面竟又不顾起码的国际准则，积极为美国帮腔的英国），那末，美国人利用投票机器来通过美国提案，本是毫不奇怪的。
    美国把持联合国剥夺中国的合法权利不论多少年，都损害不了中国人民的一根毫毛！世界上没有任何力量能够阻止新中国的飞跃前进。新中国成立十年来我们的事业已经蒸蒸日上，而且将要继续蒸蒸日上。日益强盛的社会主义的新中国巍然屹立于世界的东方，它的惊天动地的发展和为世界和平和人类进步事业而进行的英勇努力，获得了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和赞扬。我们的朋友遍天下。美国以不承认和剥夺中国在联合国的合法权利来孤立新中国的政策是绝对不会成功的。
    相反，美国阻挠中国恢复在联合国合法席位的政策，却使它自己处于越来越尴尬的境地。每逢联合国大会开幕的时候，美国就不免胆战心惊一番，深怕有一天投票机器失灵。它除了对一些国家施加压力之外，不得不亲自出马，对中国进行诬蔑，以谩骂代替战斗。但这种做法，适足以暴露美帝国主义敌视中国人民的凶恶面目。在这次联合国大会上，美国前助理国务卿罗伯逊为了替美国的荒谬立场进行辩护，不惜挖空心思，又一次为中国捏造了五大“罪状”：什么“侵略朝鲜”；“对战俘施加暴行”；“违反朝鲜协定”；“使用武力”“夺取台湾、澎湖”，“把大战的阴影带到远东”；干涉老挝，在东南亚“施加侵略性的压力”……。其实，何必讲这么多呢？世界上任何一个国家只要有其中的一条也就够坏的了。但是，这五桩明明是美国干过和正在干着的事情，罗伯逊竟统统栽到中国身上来了。如果把罗伯逊咒骂中国的那些句子的主词换为美国，那倒是一篇相当正确的演说。既然是美国犯了这些罪，那么，按照罗伯逊的逻辑，应该滚出联合国的岂不恰恰是美国自己吗？
    罗伯逊这一骂，倒也发生了出乎本意的效果。不久以前，当罗伯逊离开美国国务院职位的时候，美国国内国外不是有不少人认为这是美国对华政策改变的开始吗？现在，事情十分清楚了，不管美国的大老板把罗伯逊放在国务院也好，或者放在联合国也好，他不过是美帝国主义反华政策的一个传声筒而已。
    不过，值得人们注意的是，美国不但诬蔑和攻击中国的和平外交政策，而且疯狂地诬蔑和攻击中国的内政。美国国务卿赫脱和罗伯逊在大会上都提出所谓“西藏问题”，胡说什么中国“残暴地镇压西藏人民的基本人权”，“消灭西藏种族”，实行“殖民主义暴政”，等等。赫脱并且公然说，西藏问题“是联合国所深切关注的。面对着这种事件，本组织肯定地必须明确照直表明自己的意见”。据西方报刊透露，爱尔兰的代表正在抛头露面，为美国利用联合国干涉中国内政的阴谋进行着肮脏的活动。美国企图把纯属中国内政的西藏问题，强加于联合国大会议程，决非偶然。还在第二次大战期间，美帝国主义就把它的侵略魔爪伸进中国西藏来了。西藏叛乱集团就有一根线直通美国，这早已不是什么秘密。虽然西藏的叛乱活动已经完全失败，但是从目前的情况看来，他们却仍然企图继续进行干涉，并且企图再一次利用联合国的幌子进行各种反对中国人民的勾当。但是，这会有什么结果呢？西藏问题完全是中国的内政。美国也好，爱尔兰或别的奉行美国仇视中国政策的政府也好，为美国操纵的联合国也好，都根本无权过问，而且要干涉也绝对干涉不了。从封建农奴制度下获得解放的西藏同胞同全国各兄弟民族人民一起，丝毫也不理会敌人的叫骂，努力建设自己的幸福的新生活。至于联合国，如果继续容许美国利用联合国旗帜来干涉中国内政，诬蔑中国人民，那么，已经由于美国的一再沾污而声名扫地的联合国将更加为世界一切公正舆论所不齿。那些仰承美国鼻息的人们的喧哗，只会进一步暴露他们自己丑恶的面貌，别的结果是没有的。
