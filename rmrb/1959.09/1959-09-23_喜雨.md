Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Welcome rain has fallen widely across the Jianghuai River basin and parts of North China and Southwest China. Beginning on the 19th, rain fell successively in most areas of the six provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Sichuan, as well as the two provinces of Anhui and Guizhou, and parts of Shandong. The rainfall in southern Henan, northern and central Anhui, southwestern and southeastern Sichuan, northern and southwestern Guizhou, and most areas of Hubei was generally above 30 millimeters, with the highest exceeding 100 millimeters. The rainy area is currently moving towards the Jiangnan region.

After this rainfall, the drought situation has been alleviated or eliminated in most areas of Hubei Province, southern Henan, the Huaibei region of Anhui, and the central and southern parts of Shaanxi, which were previously experiencing drought. In the drought-affected areas of Sichuan and Guizhou, rain had already fallen before this round, and the drought situation has been basically eliminated. In the drought-affected areas of Shandong and other provinces where rainfall was less, the drought situation has not been eliminated, and continued drought resistance is still needed. The vast numbers of commune members in these areas are currently clearing ditches, repairing embankments, and storing and conserving water.

Currently, the double-cropping late rice in the Yangtze River basin is heading and flowering, and the various late autumn crops in North China and the Jianghuai region are undergoing grain (tuber) filling and grouting. Autumn planting in North China is about to begin. This rain is of great benefit to the growth of late rice and late autumn crops, and to the sowing of winter wheat.
