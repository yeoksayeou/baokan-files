    A Paean to Youth
    – After Watching the Color Film “Young People in Our Village”
    Tao Yang
    “Young People in Our Village” is a film depicting the great undertaking of diverting water by cutting through mountains during the Great Leap Forward era. In this film, the filmmakers realistically portray the heroic deeds of the young people of Kongjia Village in Shanxi Province as they cleaved mountains and diverted water, enthusiastically praising their communist spirit of daring to think and act in conquering nature and transforming the world. This new generation, with the bold spirit of subduing dragons and tigers, fought a battle against the cliffs and precipices, and finally brought the spring water from Longquan Gully, fifteen *li* away, into their own village. It can be said that this is a paean to youth, and also a paean to the new era.

    Our era is indeed an era of creating miracles.

    Look! Kongjia Village, this small mountain village, its land, has longed for spring water to nourish it for many years; and its people have had to rely for generations on a spring, five or six *li* away, as thin as a thread, to survive. However, the laboring people in power have already grasped their own destiny, especially under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line. The people's ambition to change the "poor and blank" state and the magnificent momentum of conquering nature are surging forward like an unstoppable torrent! What difficulties can the people not conquer in order to build socialism and create a happy life?! Is there no water? Let there be water! The question is whether you dare to think and act, whether you are determined to seize it! This film first tells us such a truth of life.

    The filmmakers enthusiastically shaped a group of new hero images, the most impressive of which are the three new characters of Gao Zhanwu, Cao Maolin, and Kong Shuzhen.

    Gao Zhanwu, the youth league secretary who proposed opening the canal, is a demobilized soldier who served as a sapper platoon leader in the Volunteer Army and won a meritorious service medal. Although somewhat rough in nature, his heroic and unyielding, shrewd and capable character displayed the unique noble qualities of a Communist Party member in both revolutionary cause and love life. He was determined to blast a channel out of the rocky cliffs and bring the water from Longquan Gully to the village. Several scenes in the film excellently depict his moral qualities and heroic character. When he had just fallen in love with Kong Shuzhen, Maolin confided to him that he had long been in love with Kong Shuzhen and asked him to help. For the sake of others' happiness, he suppressed his inner feelings and tried his best to give Maolin and Shuzhen opportunities to meet, while he himself suffered the torment of love. He struggled with the contradiction, and when he really couldn't bear it, he jumped up and desperately swung the hammer to drive the drill alone. This not only prominently portrayed his stubborn character, but also revealed his lofty spiritual world in the description of his complex psychological activities. Although Kong Shuzhen fell in love with him, he restrained himself until Maolin and Xiaocui were together, and then he allowed the flame of love, which had been suppressed for a long time, to burn. Another scene shows that because Li Keming was timid and overly nervous, after lighting the fuse, the knot in his waist rope came undone, and he couldn't get up the cliff. Seeing the fuse burning, he was so scared that he screamed for help. Gao Zhanwu did not hesitate to grab the rope and slide down the hillside to pull out the burning fuse, saving Li Keming's life. What an excellent portrayal of a brave, resourceful, and selfless hero!

    Another lovable character is Maolin, who is loyal, honest, and skillful, nicknamed "Seventy-Three Trades." He created safe fuses and soil levels, and together with Xiaocui, they created a live-bottom dump truck, soil searchlights, etc. This ordinary worker not only reflects the face of the rural technical revolution movement but also demonstrates the infinite wisdom of the working people in creation and invention. Comrade Liang Yin excellently embodied the spiritual outlook of this simple rural youth in his character creation.

    Kong Shuzhen is active, enthusiastic, bold, and forthright, and is a new woman of our era. After graduating from middle school, she was determined to devote herself to the socialist construction of the countryside. She loved life and loved her hometown. At the volunteer team registration meeting for opening the canal, she was the first to stand up. The masses ridiculed her, and even the old director of the cooperative mocked her, saying: "Shuzhen! Forget it! Not to mention anything else, your two braids will always get caught by the branches in the mountains." She immediately took the scissors from Fatty Sister's hand, cut off her braids, and threw them to the director. Her high-spiritedness immediately excited the whole audience, and the young people raised their hands to sign up one by one. Her actions were based on her beautiful hopes. She wanted to build a large pond by the village to raise fish, ducks, and grow rice, to turn her hometown into Jiangnan. What a bold and idealistic young image!

    Although these young people have many different characteristics, their common character traits are very significant, that is, their dedication of youth to the cause of the motherland and their vigorous revolutionary heroism.

    The film depicts the boiling labor scene with magnificent scenes. The thunderous sound of cannons on the cliffs and the billowing smoke rising into the clouds vividly express the spirit of the Great Leap Forward era of declaring war on nature. After the establishment of the people's commune, the picture of all the people mobilizing to fight at night is so poetic and picturesque. The ground is full of lanterns and torches, looking like fire dragons dancing in the distance. Thanks to the overall mobilization of the commune, the project originally planned to be completed in five years was completed in two months. Isn't this a miracle? The film convincingly demonstrates the superiority of communization and the magical speed of construction during the Great Leap Forward era.

    The film's shortcoming is that it depicts too many love entanglements. I think that instead of spending so much energy depicting love entanglements, it would be better to use more energy to more artistically summarize the spirit of the era that permeates real life, and it would be better to more meticulously shape typical heroic images. In this way, it may be more brilliant in art.

    Nevertheless, “Young People in Our Village” is a good work. It depicts the new and progressive things in real life, and praises a new generation growing up in the historical process of the Great Leap Forward. It commends the great present, and also reveals a beautiful future, giving us great encouragement and inspiring our feelings of pride. Let the hostile elements at home and abroad clamor! Our motherland's magnificent socialist construction cause is thriving like the rising sun, and any reactionary force in the world trying to erase it is foolish and ridiculous!

    青春的赞歌
    ——彩色影片“我们村里的年轻人”观后
    陶阳
    “我们村里的年轻人”是表现大跃进时代劈山引水这个伟大事业的一部影片。在这部影片里，电影制作者们真实地描写了山西省的一个山村——孔家庄的青年开山劈岭的英雄业绩，热情地歌颂了他们征服自然和改造世界的那种敢想敢干的共产主义风格。这一代新人，以降龙伏虎的豪迈气魄和悬崖峭壁大战了一场，终于把远离十五华里的龙泉沟的泉水引进了自己的村庄。可以说，这是一部青春的赞歌，也是一部新时代的赞歌。
    我们的时代，的确是创造奇迹的时代。
    看吧！孔家庄这个小小的山村，它的土地，多少年来渴望着泉水来滋润；而它的人民，也只好世世代代靠着离村五六里路远的一股细得像根线似的泉水活命。但是，当权的劳动人民，已经掌握了自己的命运，特别是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，人民群众那种改变“一穷二白”状态的雄心大志和征服自然的磅礴气势，像不可阻挡的洪流一样向前奔腾冲击！人民为了建设社会主义，为了创造幸福生活，还有什么困难不可以征服呢？！没有水吗？叫它有就有！问题在于你是否敢想敢干，是否立志要去夺取！这部影片，首先告诉了我们这样一个生活的真理。
    电影制作者满怀激情地塑造了一群新的英雄形象，给人印象最深刻的是高占武、曹茂林、孔淑贞这三个新人物。
    开渠的倡议者青年委员高占武是个复员军人，他曾在志愿军当过工兵排长，获过功臣奖章。性情虽然有些粗暴，但是，他的英武倔强，精明强干的性格，无论在革命事业上和爱情生活上都显示了一个共产党员特有的高贵品质。他下定决心要从石崖上炸出一条渠道，把龙泉沟的水引到村里来。影片里有几场戏出色地描绘了他的道德品质和英雄性格。他刚刚爱上孔淑贞的时候，茂林却向他倾吐早已爱上孔淑贞的心情，并请他帮忙。他为了别人的幸福，就抑制了内心的情感，想尽办法给茂林和淑贞接触的机会，而让自己受着爱情的折磨。他矛盾、斗争，实在忍受不住的时候，就跳起来独自个死命地抡锤打钎。这不仅突出地刻划了他的倔强性格，也在描写他复杂的心理活动中揭示了他崇高的精神世界。虽然，孔淑贞爱上了他，但他还是克制自己，直到茂林和小翠好了以后，他才让压抑了很久的爱情的火焰燃烧起来。另一场戏，是李克明由于胆小，过度紧张，点着导火线以后，腰里的绳结又开了，上不了山崖，眼看导火线在燃烧，只吓得狂呼救命，高占武毫不犹豫地抓住绳子滑到半山崖拔去了燃烧着的导火线，救了李克明的性命。一个果敢、机智、舍己救人的英雄形象，表现得多么出色！
    另一个可爱的人物是茂林，忠实厚道，心灵手巧，外号叫“七十三行”。他创造了安全导火线、土水平仪，又和小翠创造了活底推土车、土探照灯等等，在这个普通劳动者的身上不仅反映了农村技术革命运动的面貌，也表现了劳动人民创造发明的无穷智慧。演员梁音同志在形象创造上很出色地体现了这个质朴农村青年的精神面貌。
    孔淑贞积极热情，大胆泼辣，是我们时代的新女性。她中学毕业回来，就决心投入农村的社会主义建设事业。她热爱生活，热爱家乡，在开渠志愿队报名大会上，她首先挺身而出，群众讥笑她，连老社长也奚落她说：“淑贞！算了吧！不用说别的，就你那两根辫子到山里也总会叫树枝给挂住的。”她立刻从胖大嫂的手里拿过剪刀剪下辫子，扔给社长，她那种意气风发的劲头，顿时，使全场激动起来，年轻人一个个举手报名。她的行动是基于她美好的希望，她想在村边修个大池塘养鱼、养鸭、种水稻，要把自己的家乡变成江南，这是一个多么泼辣而又富有理想的青年形象呵！
    尽管这些青年人的性格有许多不同之处，但是他们共同的性格特征却是十分显著的，那就是把自己的青春献给祖国的事业心和朝气蓬勃的革命的英雄主义精神。
    影片以雄伟的场面，描绘了沸腾的劳动场景。那悬崖上响震天宇的??的炮声，那高入云霄的滚滚的烟雾，生动地表现了向大自然宣战的大跃进的时代精神。人民公社成立以后，全体动员夜战的画面，多么富有诗情画意，大地上布满了灯笼火把，远远望去像一条条火龙在飞舞。由于公社的全体动员，本来计划五年完成的工程，两个月就完成了，难道这不是奇迹吗？影片，令人信服地表现了公社化的优越性和大跃进时代建设事业的神奇的速度。
    影片美中不足之处，是描写恋爱的纠葛多了些。我以为与其花那么多的精力去描写恋爱纠葛，倒不如用较多的精力更加艺术地去概括现实生活里洋溢着的时代精神，倒不如更加细致地去塑造典型的英雄形象。这样，在艺术上或许更有光彩一些。
    尽管如此，“我们村里的年轻人”不失为一部好作品。它描写了现实生活中新生的、前进的事物，赞美了在大跃进历史进程中成长着的一代新人。它表彰了伟大的今天，也揭示了美好的未来，给予我们很大的鼓舞力量，激励了我们自豪的感情。让国内外的敌对分子们叫嚣吧！我们祖国的宏伟的社会主义建设事业，像初升的太阳一样蒸蒸日上，世界上任何反动势力企图把它一笔抹煞，那都是愚蠢可笑的！
