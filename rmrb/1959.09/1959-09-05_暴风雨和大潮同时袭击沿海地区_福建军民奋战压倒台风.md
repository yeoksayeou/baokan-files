Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 4th – A typhoon from the Pacific Ocean struck the coastal areas of Pingtan and the Minjiang River estuary in Fujian this afternoon and has since moved northeast. The wind force at the center of the typhoon has gradually decreased from level 12 to level 10. The coastal areas of the Minhou and Fu'an prefectures affected by the typhoon experienced winds of level 8 to 9, which are continuing to weaken. During the typhoon's impact on the Fujian coast, heavy rains occurred successively in various coastal areas of Minhou and Fu'an prefectures.

During this typhoon, the first high tide of September 5th (i.e., the 3rd day of the 8th lunar month) occurred along the Fujian coast. This meant that the typhoon, heavy rain, and high tide combined, causing a very strong impact on sea and river dikes, and bringing many difficulties to the struggle against wind and tide. However, under the strong leadership and organization of Party committees at all levels, and with the experience of having overcome the previous two strong typhoons, the vast masses of coastal areas, and the millions of people who had been organized in the previous struggle against wind and in the past few days to resist the September high tide, immediately plunged into the struggle against the typhoon and high tide when the typhoon began to affect and hit the coastal areas. As of this morning, most of the dangerous sections of the more than 1,800 kilometers of coastline in the province, as well as the river and sea dikes that had been breached and damaged in the previous two typhoons, had been repaired and blocked before the typhoon and high tide struck, and had been heightened and thickened, greatly enhancing their ability to resist the typhoon and high tide. When the typhoon struck the coast of Lianjiang County, a 19,000-strong army for wind and flood control, composed of commune members from various communes and officers and soldiers of the local garrison, fought through the night until this morning, rescuing 140 dangerous sections of the dike. All dangerous sections in the county were reinforced, and a large amount of emergency reserve soil was prepared for many sections. The more than 26,000-strong army for wind and tide control in various communes in Pingtan County generally widened 219 sea dikes by 1.5 to 2 meters and raised them by more than 1 meter. Under the organization of the wind resistance army of the people's communes, all of Lianjiang and Pingtan counties' more than 6,000 fishing boats and transport ships entered safe areas before the typhoon struck. In the lower reaches of the Minjiang River and other areas affected by the typhoon, all ships also sailed into sheltered islands or were moved ashore. Thanks to timely and sufficient preparation, from the time the typhoon affected the area last night until the typhoon struck the Minjiang River estuary, although the tides followed the typhoon and fiercely impacted the sea and river banks, no dike breaks occurred, except for some farmland flooding in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River.

As the typhoon's direction shifted, the wind force gradually weakened along the northern coast of Fujian. Today and tomorrow are the peak of the high tide season, and heavy rains will occur successively in the Pinghe, Fu'an prefectures and the eastern part of the Nanping prefecture. Therefore, the threat to sea and river dikes and some water conservancy projects such as reservoirs is still very great. At present, the water level in the coastal areas and the lower reaches of the Minjiang River is rising rapidly, and in many areas it has exceeded the warning level. The wind and flood control army along the coast of Fujian and along the banks of various river mouths is fighting heroically under the leadership of local Party committees and communes to ensure the safety of sea and river dikes, crops, and the lives and property of millions of people in coastal areas.

### 暴风雨和大潮同时袭击沿海地区  福建军民奋战压倒台风

    暴风雨和大潮同时袭击沿海地区
    福建军民奋战压倒台风
    新华社福州4日电　来自太平洋上的台风，今天下午侵袭福建沿海的平潭和闽江口一带以后，已向东北方向转移。台风中心风力由十二级逐渐减弱到十级。波及的闽侯专区和福安专区沿海地区，风力八级到九级，并在继续减弱中。在台风侵袭福建沿海时，闽侯和福安专区沿海各地先后都出现了暴雨。
    这次台风侵袭期间，正逢福建沿海9月5日（即农历8月初3）第一次大潮，这就形成台风、暴雨、大潮三者交加，对海、江堤坝等的冲击很猛，给抗风抗潮斗争带来很多困难。但在各级党委强有力的领导和组织下，沿海广大群众又有了战胜前两次强台风的经验，当台风开始波及和侵袭到沿海地区时，在前次抗风斗争中和前几天为抗击9月大潮而组织起来的数百万大军，便立即奋勇投入了抗击台风和大潮的斗争。到今晨止，全省一千八百多公里的海岸线上，绝大部分险要堤段和在前两次台风中决口和损坏的江堤海堤，都已在台风和大潮侵袭前修堵起来，并且得到了加高培厚，大大增强了抗击台风和大潮能力。在台风侵袭连江县沿海时，由各公社社员和当地驻军官兵组成的一万九千人的抗风防汛大军，连夜冒着风雨奋战到今天早晨，抢救了一百四十处险要堤段，全县所有险要堤段都得到加固，许多堤段还准备了大量抢险预备土。平潭县各公社两万六千多人的抗风抗潮大军，将二百一十九条海堤普遍加宽一米半到二米，加高一米多。连江和平潭两县六千多条渔船和运输船，在各人民公社抗风大军的组织下，全部在台风侵袭以前进入安全地带。在闽江下游和台风波及的其他地区，所有船只也都驶进避风岛或搬到岸上。由于准备及时和充分，从昨天夜里台风波及时起，至台风侵袭到闽江口一带时止，尽管潮汛接着台风，凶猛地向海、江堤岸冲击，除了闽江下游处部分农田漫水外，还没有发生决堤现象。
    随着台风方向转移后，福建北部沿海风力逐渐减弱。今明两天是大潮汛盛期，同时平和、福安专区和南平专区东部地区，将陆续发生暴雨。因此，对海江堤坝和一些水库等水利工程的威胁仍然很大，现在沿海和闽江下游水位正迅速上涨，不少地区超过警戒水位。福建沿海和各江口沿岸的抗风、防汛大军，正在各地党委和公社的领导下进行英勇奋战，确保海江堤坝农作物和沿海地区数百万人民生命财产的安全。
