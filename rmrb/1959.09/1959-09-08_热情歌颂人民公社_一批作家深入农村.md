Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Chinese writers are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call to further strengthen their ties with the masses and write more and better works. Recently, many writers have resolved to continue to delve into the people's communes throughout the country. Through firsthand observation and experience, they will use truthful descriptions to elucidate the superiority and great victories of the people's communes, inspire the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in building socialism, and refute the slander of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes by reactionary elements and right-leaning opportunists at home and abroad. The Chinese Writers Association and its local branches have supported the writers' wishes and are assisting them in going to various places around the National Day.

It is reported that the writers who are already in the people's communes or are about to depart for the people's communes include Ba Jin, Sha Ting, Tian Jian, Ouyang Shan, Wei Jinzhi, Jiang Muliang, Ma Feng, Kang Tuo, Liu Qing, Chen Canyun, Chen Xiaoyu, Bi Ye, Han Zi, Yan Chen, Chen Dengke, Sun Junqing, Li Zhun, Wang Lin, Liu Zhixia, Wang Yuhu, Wei Gangyan, Wang Wenshi, Ma Jia, Cai Tianxin, Lu Fei, Li Ruobing, Wang Anyou, Liu Shude, Li Qiao, Li Bing, Li Na, Menghe Boyan, Ji Xuepei, Guo Feng, and Li Fangli. They will go to the people's communes in the suburbs of the capital, the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, and the remote areas and ethnic minority areas of Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. They will make short-term visits or long-term in-depth studies, using various literary styles such as features, reports, poems, and essays to quickly reflect the new things and great victories of the people's communes.
