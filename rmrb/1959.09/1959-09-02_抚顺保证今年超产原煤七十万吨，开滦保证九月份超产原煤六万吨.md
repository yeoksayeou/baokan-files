The coal mining team of Pang Guanxiang, a national advanced producer—Team 1 of District 6 of the Laohutai Mine—after heated discussions, unanimously proposed to work hard in the crucial month of September and erect a high-yield red flag: to create a monthly record of 37,000 tons of coal on an 80-meter-long coal mining face. Jia Lianfu, the red banner holder of Liaoning Province and Fushun City and driver of electric shovel No. 5 of the Xilutian Mine, proposed to further promote the advanced experience of layered mining and selective loading, to ensure the completion of the state plan one month ahead of schedule, and to use this as a condition to challenge all coal mining electric shovel drivers in the mine. Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 1st: Fushun Coal Mine completed the August national production plan one day ahead of schedule, and coal production increased by 7.4% compared with July.

Since August, the production level of Fushun Coal Mine has been increasing every ten days.

After the publication of the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the masses was even more encouraged. From the 26th to the 30th, the average daily production level of raw coal reached more than 64,500 tons, an increase of more than 13,500 tons per day compared with the previous five days.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 1st: The workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have overfulfilled the August raw coal production and tunneling footage plans, and are determined to work hard in September to ensure the overproduction of 60,000 tons of raw coal to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

Within a few days, employees of various mines have put forward thousands of rationalization proposals aimed at the current key issues in production. In addition, from the General Administration to various mines, advanced experience promotion offices have been established to summarize the effective advanced experiences since August, formulate promotion measures, and make them blossom everywhere. The employees of the repair department are going all out to repair damaged equipment to ensure that miners have sufficient sophisticated weapons.
