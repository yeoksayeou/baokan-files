    波兰师生喜迎新学年
    一年级小学生增加三十万
    据新华社华沙电　波兰的大中小学的学生已经结束了愉快的暑假生活，目前正在精神饱满地准备投入1959—1960新学年的学习生活。
    在新学年里，波兰将有七十六万名儿童进入小学一年级，这比去年增加三十万人。在新学年里，小学生人数将达到四百五十四万名。
    为了使日益增加的学龄儿童都能入学，今年国家拨出了巨额款项来增建新校舍。全国人民也正在热烈开展为庆祝波兰建国一千年而建设一千所学校的运动。目前，这一运动的第一批校舍已经落成。
    在新学年里，各小学的教学课程中加强了培养青少年实际生产知识的项目。有一千所小学取消了宗教课，而一年前只有少数学校没有。
