Anshan Iron and Steel Climbs the Shortcut, Soaring Straight Up

Workers proposed over 100,000 suggestions for improving production in hundreds of thousands of big-character posters and thousands of meetings.

August compared to July: Steel increased by 2.1%, steel products increased by 9%, steel billets increased by 9.1%, pig iron increased by 2.2%.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 3rd (Reporter Sun Minghui) reported: A large-scale mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy has made Anshan Iron and Steel's production surge one wave after another. After setting record highs for steel and steel product output since the start of operations in July, this steel company achieved even higher records in August for steel, steel product, and steel billet output. Compared with July's output, steel increased by 2.1%, steel products increased by 9%, steel billets increased by 9.1%, and pig iron increased by 2.2%. Currently, the broad masses of workers are advancing victoriously, determined to continue working hard and skillfully in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to achieve ahead of schedule the increased production targets for steel, steel products, and pig iron they proposed to the national iron and steel enterprises.

Since mid-June, under the leadership of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Anshan Iron and Steel has adopted the method of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate to launch a mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy throughout the company. In the past two months, workers have put forward more than 100,000 suggestions for improving production through hundreds of thousands of big-character posters and thousands of meetings, solved a large number of key production problems, and continuously pushed production to new levels.

More than two months of experience have proven that vigorously carrying out mass movements, thoroughly breaking rightist conservative ideology, and vigorously grasping key production issues are the most fundamental reasons for Anshan Iron and Steel's successive leaps in production and the rapid formation and continuous development of a new high tide in increasing production and practicing economy.

In this large-scale mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy, the broad masses of workers at Anshan Iron and Steel have consistently waged a serious struggle against rightist conservative ideology. Since the beginning of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel workers have criticized the rightist slackening mood of a few cadres and achieved great results in production, but after achieving an "all-around red" in production in May, the rightist slackening mood of some cadres resurfaced, resulting in poor production in some factories and mines in the first half of June. After serious criticism of this rightist conservative ideology, production greatly improved in late June, and new records in steel and steel product production were continuously created in July and August. For example, before mid-June, the No. 1 Blooming Mill had many equipment accidents and did not complete its plan well, with some cadres overemphasizing objective difficulties. After continuously criticizing rightist slackening moods and boosting revolutionary drive, the entire factory mobilized workers to overcome equipment, quality, and raw material barriers. Not only did they overfulfill the June plan, but also, under unfavorable raw material conditions, production in July and August saw an unprecedented leap, with monthly overfulfillment of the plan.

The continuous deepening of Anshan Iron and Steel's increase production and practice economy movement is also the continuous boosting of energy and overcoming right-leaning conservative ideology. Another experience of Anshan Iron and Steel in the large-scale mass movement to increase production and conserve economy is to closely integrate the opposition to right-leaning conservatism with the breakthrough of key production issues and the organization of new production upsurges; to promote the emergence and development of production upsurges with the ideological achievements of opposing right-leaning conservatism; and to promote the struggle against right-leaning conservatism with the achievements of the new production upsurge. On the basis of opposing right-leaning conservatism, all factories and mines have promptly guided the masses' enthusiasm to solving key production problems and completing national plans, and with the spirit of continuous revolution, have repeatedly pushed production to new peaks. In the leadership aspect of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, they seized the main contradiction of new equipment and unskilled workers, and organized a company-wide technical performance during the movement, from charging, smelting, tapping, ingot casting, furnace repair, furnace patching, to slag removal, and other processes, were performed. Through performances, workers learned from each other and improved together, which greatly improved the technical level of the workers in a short period of time, broke through the technical barrier, and increased steel production by more than 11,000 tons in July compared with the national plan. Since August, with the further improvement of workers' technical level and the promotion of advanced experience, and with the growing revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, the leadership has also studied with the workers and revised the original target of increasing steel production by 30,000 tons for the whole year, and decided to increase the production of high-quality steel by 70,000 tons for the whole year, which has further encouraged the fighting enthusiasm of the workers, and in August, steel production increased by more than 11,000 tons compared with the national plan. In this movement, the workers of the rolling mill combined the criticism of right-leaning slackening emotions, pooled their wisdom and efforts, and solved a series of key problems in equipment maintenance, operating rate, and quality, which made the production level rise in a straight line, and revised the original production increase target four times. By August 30, they had achieved their original proposal to increase steel production by 100,000 tons in the third quarter one month and one day ahead of schedule.

In the movement, all factories and mines also vigorously strengthened enterprise management, closely combining the mass movement with enterprise management to ensure the healthy and in-depth development of the movement. In the past two months or so, all factories and mines have adopted methods such as combining leadership with the masses and combining large-scale destruction with large-scale establishment, and have established a total of one thousand several hundred new rules and regulations, revised and supplemented more than two thousand, and retained more than one thousand four hundred. At the same time, the company has also initially formulated a complete set of enterprise management programs based on the opinions of the broad masses of workers, and is preparing to further implement them. The rolling plate factory seized the four regulations that are most urgent for production, namely, post regulations, technical operating regulations, equipment maintenance regulations, and safety regulations, launched the masses to express their opinions and discussions, and carried out rectification and implementation, which resulted in a steady increase in production: the output in July increased by 24% compared with June, the quality increased by 4%, and since August, the quality and output have increased again.

Another important experience of Anshan Iron and Steel in carrying out mass movements on a large scale is to organize various forms of competition to consolidate and continuously improve the production enthusiasm of the workers. At present, the cooperation competition centered on the ironmaking plant in seven factories, the cooperation competition centered on the steelmaking plant in thirteen factories, the cooperation competition centered on the No. 1 Blooming Mill in the rolling mills, as well as the internal rivalries and technical performance competitions in various factories, have all been vigorously launched. Among them, the technical performance competition created by the workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces is particularly popular with the workers and has been widely promoted in various factories and mines.

    大搞群众运动　大破右倾思想　大抓生产关键
    鞍钢登上捷径扶摇直上
    职工在几十万张大字报和千百次会议上提出了十几万件改进生产的建议
    八月同七月比较：钢增加2.1％，钢材增加9％，钢坯增加9.1％，生铁增加2.2％
    新华社鞍山3日电　记者孙铭惠报道：大规模的群众性增产节约运动使鞍钢的生产一浪高过一浪。这个钢铁公司继7月份钢和钢材创开工以来最高产量纪录以后，8月份钢、钢材、钢坯的产量又达到了更高的纪录。同7月份的产量比较，钢增加2.1％，钢材增加9％，钢坯增加9.1％，生铁增加2.2％。现在，广大职工正乘胜前进，决心在增产节约运动中继续大干巧干，力争提前实现他们向全国钢铁企业倡议的提前完成全年钢、钢材和生铁计划的增产指标。
    从6月中旬起，鞍钢在中共辽宁省委和鞍山市委的领导下，采用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，在全公司开展了群众性的增产节约运动。两个多月来，职工们通过几十万张大字报和千百次会议，提出了十几万件改进生产的建议，解决了大量的生产关键问题，把生产不断推向新的水平。
    两个多月的经验证明了：大搞群众运动，大破右倾保守思想，大抓生产关键，是鞍钢生产一跃再跃、增产节约新高潮迅速形成和不断发展的最根本原因。
    鞍钢广大职工在这次声势浩大的群众性增产节约运动中，自始至终都对右倾保守思想进行了严肃的斗争。今年年初以来，鞍钢的职工就曾批判了少数干部的右倾松劲情绪，并在生产上取得了很大成果，但是5月份获得生产“满堂红”之后，部分干部的右倾松劲情绪又有滋长，结果有些厂矿6月上半月生产情况不好。经过对这种右倾保守思想认真严肃的批判，6月下旬生产就大大好转，7、8两月连续创造了钢和钢材生产的新纪录。如第一初轧厂在6月中旬前，设备事故多，计划完成得不好，有些干部过分强调客观困难，以后经过不断批判右倾松劲情绪，鼓起了革命干劲，全厂发动职工大破设备关、质量关和原料关，不仅超额完成了6月份计划，而且在原料条件不好的情况下，7、8两月的生产也出现了空前大跃进的局面，每月都超额完成了计划。
    鞍钢这次增产节约运动不断深入的过程，也就是不断鼓足干劲和不断克服右倾保守思想的过程。鞍钢在大规模群众性增产节约运动中所获得的另一项经验，就是把反对右倾保守思想同大破生产关键和组织生产新高潮紧密结合起来，用反右倾保守的思想成果促进生产高潮的出现和发展；用生产新高潮的成就促进反右倾保守的斗争。在反对右倾保守思想的基础上，各厂矿都及时把群众的干劲引导到解决生产关键和完成国家计划上来，并以不断革命的精神，一再把生产推向新的高峰。五座大型固定式平炉的领导方面，抓住设备新、工人技术不熟练这一主要矛盾，在运动中组织了全厂性的技术大表演，从装料、熔炼、出钢、铸锭、修炉、补炉到清渣等各个工序，都进行了表演。通过表演，工人互相学习，共同提高，短时间就使工人们技术水平大为提高，突破了技术关，7月份比国家计划增产钢一万一千多吨。8月份以来，随着工人技术水平的进一步提高和先进经验的推广、随着职工们革命干劲的日益高涨，领导方面又同工人研究，修改了原订全年增产三万吨钢的指标，决定全年增产优质钢七万吨，这就更加鼓舞了职工的战斗热情，8月份就又比国家计划增产钢一万一千多吨。轧钢厂的职工，在这次运动中，结合批判右倾松劲情绪，群策群力，在设备维护、作业率和质量等方面，都解决了一系列的关键问题，使生产水平直线上升，并且四次修改原订的增产指标，到8月30日止，提前一个月零一天实现了他们原订的在第三季度增产十万吨钢材的倡议。
    在运动中，各厂矿还大力加强了企业管理工作，把群众运动同企业管理紧密结合起来，保证运动健康、深入地发展。在最近两个多月里，各厂矿采取领导与群众相结合，大破和大立相结合等办法，共建立了一千几百种新的规章制度，修改和补充了两千多种，保留了一千四百多种，同时公司根据广大职工群众的意见，还初步制订了一整套企业管理方案，准备进一步贯彻。轧板厂抓住了对生产最为迫切的岗位规程、技术操作规程、设备维护规程、安全规程等四个规程，发动群众鸣放讨论，并进行整顿和贯彻，结果使生产稳步上升：7月份产量比6月增长24％，质量提高4％，8月份以来，质量和产量又有了提高。
    鞍钢大搞群众运动的再一项重要经验是组织多种形式的竞赛，以巩固和不断提高职工群众的生产热情。目前，以炼铁厂为中心的七个厂的协作竞赛，以炼钢厂为中心的十三个厂的协作竞赛，以初轧厂为中心的各轧钢厂的协作竞赛，以及各厂内部的对手赛和技术表演赛，都已轰轰烈烈地开展起来。其中五座大型固定式平炉的职工所创造的技术表演赛，特别为职工喜闻乐见，已在各厂矿普遍推广。
