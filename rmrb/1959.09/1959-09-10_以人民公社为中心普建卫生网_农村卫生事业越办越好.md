    Building a Comprehensive Health Network Centered on People's Communes:
    Rural Health Services Are Getting Better and Better
    (Our Correspondent Huang Kangcheng reports) Since the realization of people's communes in China's rural areas, health services have seen a leap forward in development. Various localities, in conjunction with the rectification of the communes, have carried out rectification, consolidation, and improvement of health services. Over the past year, the tremendous superiority of people's commune health services in serving rural production and the health of farmers has been fully demonstrated.
    According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Health for the first half of 1959, each commune has established one or more health centers (hospitals), production brigades have set up health clinics (health stations) and maternity hospitals, and most production teams and natural villages have health rooms. Compared with before communization, the number of hospitals and simple beds in communes has increased by about threefold, maternity hospitals by about eightfold, and simple maternity beds by more than tenfold. In addition, people's communes have an even larger number of health workers and midwives who are partially or completely detached from production. A health work network centered on people's communes has been basically formed in China's rural areas, and the face of rural health work has undergone a great change.
    The development of people's commune health services has initially demonstrated a powerful force in eliminating the most harmful diseases. For example, the number of people treated for the four major parasitic diseases in 1959 has increased several times over compared to 1957. Most of the treatment was carried out in rural areas. According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, in 1958, more than 3,178,000 patients were treated for schistosomiasis, about three times that of 1957; more than 2,446,000 patients were treated for filariasis, about sixteen times that of 1957; and more than 30,830,000 patients were treated for hookworm disease, 5.6 times that of 1957.
    Since the second half of 1958, when the large-scale people's commune movement was surging forward in China's rural areas and collective welfare undertakings of the people's communes were established one after another, the broad masses of farmers have requested the communes to establish health centers and maternity hospitals. Encouraged by the Great Leap Forward and the communization situation, grassroots cadres and health cadres, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, broke down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and implemented the policy of "walking on two legs" in running health services, vigorously promoting people-run health services. As a result, farmers contributed labor, materials, and furniture, and voluntarily vacated surplus houses for the communes to establish hospitals and maternity hospitals.
    The establishment of a rural health work network centered on people's communes and adapted to commune production has fundamentally changed the long-term lack of medical and health personnel and the extremely uneven distribution of medical points in China's rural areas, providing a preliminary guarantee for the health of farmers and the elimination of diseases. In the past, it was difficult for farmers to seek medical treatment for minor illnesses, and for serious illnesses, they had to go to the city, often having to travel dozens or hundreds of miles or more, which was both expensive and untimely, and delayed production time. Now, China's rural areas have begun to establish a health work network, and farmers can receive timely treatment nearby when they are ill, saving money and time. Not only can minor injuries and illnesses be treated at any time, but those who need hospitalization can also be hospitalized and treated in a timely manner. Therefore, commune health centers (hospitals) have been deeply welcomed and loved by farmers since their birth. Guo Tianxi, a commune member of Shihuitun Village, Yuanjinghe Township, Hejian County, Hebei Province, was injured by a cart. After being rescued and treated by the commune health center in time, he was cured and discharged from the hospital. He said with emotion: "If our township hadn't established a hospital, my life would have been over!"
    These commune health centers (hospitals), appearing in a brand-new posture, are different in nature from the former township joint clinics. They are completely owned by the commune and operate under the unified leadership of the commune. Generally, the secretary or a member of the commune Party committee serves as the director of the commune health center (hospital). Therefore, commune health centers (hospitals) have taken a big step forward compared to the former township joint clinics in realizing medical and health services for production and implementing the policy of "prevention first, combining prevention and treatment." Commune medical and health personnel no longer only carry out medical work in the hospital, but more often go out of the hospital and into the masses, often conducting mobile medical services. They strive to become familiar with rural production, care about farmers' lives, and study various pathogenic factors to guide health work. Many commune medical personnel go to the fields to treat diseases, and if there are no patients, they participate in labor or publicize health knowledge and carry out labor protection work. In terms of labor arrangement, medical personnel cooperate with production team leaders to properly arrange work for elderly and weak commune members, and for women's labor protection, they have adopted the method of "reducing heavy work and not damp work during pregnancy, reducing dry work and not wet work during menstruation, and assigning work that is closer rather than further during lactation."
    Over the past year, in the prevention and treatment of winter and spring diseases, in the prevention of summer and autumn intestinal infectious diseases, in the tense production struggles of spring plowing, summer harvesting and planting, and autumn harvesting, and in the struggle against drought and flood, the vast medical personnel of the communes have played an active role in ensuring the health of the millions of labor forces in rural areas, preventing and eliminating diseases. Urban and rural medical personnel in the flood-stricken areas of Guangdong Province did everything possible to prevent the occurrence of summer infectious diseases, treated more than 9,200 injured and sick people, and timely controlled the spread of diseases in the disaster areas after the disaster, and also guided the masses to do a good job in environmental sanitation work after the flood receded.
    Through caring about and familiarizing themselves with the lives of farmers, people's commune medical personnel have carried out the popularization of health knowledge, promoting the development of mass health work. Some health personnel from the Wanchun People's Commune in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, participated in canteen work, discussed and improved cooking techniques with cooks, installed sand filter tanks, and improved drinking water hygiene. Over the past year, people's communes in various places have repeatedly and vigorously conducted health training for "four personnel" (cooks, nursery workers, health workers, and midwives), and through the trained cooks, nursery workers, health workers, and midwives, they have strengthened the health management and epidemic reporting work of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens.
    The establishment of a rural health work network centered on people's communes has laid the foundation for the popularization of health services in China's rural areas and is also a new development of China's entire health cause after the realization of people's communes in rural areas. In the future, the health services of people's communes will achieve even greater development.

    以人民公社为中心普建卫生网
    农村卫生事业越办越好
    本报讯　记者黄康成报道：我国农村实现人民公社化以来，卫生事业有了飞跃的发展。各地人民公社结合整社，对卫生事业进行整顿、巩固、提高。一年来充分显示出人民公社卫生事业为农村生产、为农民健康服务的巨大优越性。
    据卫生部1959年上半年初步统计，每个公社都建立了卫生院（医院）一个或几个，生产大队设立了卫生所（保健站）、产院，多数生产队、自然村设有卫生室。与公社化前相比，公社的医院和简易床位增加约三倍，产院增加约八倍，简易产床增加约十倍以上。此外，人民公社还有为数更多的半脱离生产、不脱离生产的保健员、接生员。我国农村以人民公社为中心的卫生工作网已经基本形成，农村的卫生工作面貌大有改观。
    人民公社卫生事业的发展，一开始就显示出消灭危害最严重的疾病的强大力量。如1959年四大寄生虫病的治疗人数比1957年有了成倍的增长。大多数的治疗是在农村中进行的。据卫生部统计，1958年治疗血吸虫病患者三百一十七万八千多人，约为1957年的三倍；治疗丝虫病患者二百四十四万六千多人，约为1957年的十六倍；治疗钩虫病患者三千零八十三万多人，为1957年的五点六倍。
    从1958年下半年以来，当我国农村大规模的人民公社化运动正在风起云涌般展开、人民公社集体福利事业相继建立的时候，广大农民群众纷纷要求公社建立卫生院、产院。基层干部和卫生干部在大跃进和公社化形势鼓舞下，在各级党委领导下，破除迷信，解放思想，在举办卫生事业中贯彻两条腿走路的方针，大力提倡民办卫生事业。于是，农民群众纷纷献工献料、献家具，并自动腾出多余的房屋，供给公社建立医院、产院使用。
    以人民公社为中心、与公社生产相适应的农村卫生工作网的建立，从根本上改变了我国农村过去长期缺乏医药卫生人员和医疗点分布极不平衡的状况，为农民身体健康、消除疾病提供了初步的保证。过去农民有小病很难就医，大病非到城里看不行，常常要走几十里、上百里或更远的路，既多花钱，又不及时，更耽误了生产时间。现在，我国农村已开始建立起卫生工作网，农民们有病能够就近及时治疗，既少花钱又省时间，不但小伤小病随时可以医治，需要住院的也能及时住院治疗。所以，公社卫生院（医院）一诞生，就深受农民欢迎和喜爱。河北省河间县原景和乡石灰屯村社员郭天西，被大车轧伤，经公社卫生院及时抢救，治愈出院，他感动地说：“要不是咱乡办了医院，我的命准完啦！”
    这些以崭新姿态出现的公社卫生院（医院）比过去的乡联合诊所在性质上已经两样。它完全属于公社所有；并且在公社的统一领导下进行工作。一般都是由公社党委书记或委员担任公社卫生院（医院）院长，因而公社卫生院（医院）在实现医疗卫生为生产服务和贯彻以预防为主、防治结合的方针上，比过去乡联合诊所大大向前迈进了一步。公社医务卫生人员已经不单在医院里进行医疗工作，更多的是走出医院，深入群众，经常进行巡回医疗。他们努力熟悉农村生产，关心农民生活，研究各种致病因素，用以指导卫生工作。许多公社医务人员深入田间有病看病，无病就参加劳动或宣传卫生知识，进行劳动保护工作。在劳力安排上，医务人员配合生产队长，负责对年老体弱的社员适当安排，对妇女的劳动保护，采取了“孕期调轻不调重、经期调干不调湿、哺乳期调近不调远”的办法。
    一年来在防治冬春季疾病、在预防夏秋季肠道传染病中，在春耕、夏收夏种和秋收的紧张生产斗争中，在抗旱防涝的斗争中，公社的广大医务人员对保障农村中的千千万万劳动大军的健康，预防和消灭疾病，起了积极的作用。广东省水灾区的城乡医务人员，千方百计防止夏季传染病发生，治疗了伤病员九千二百多人，及时控制了灾区在灾后的疾病传播，并且又指导群众搞好洪水退后的环境卫生工作。
    人民公社医务人员通过对农民生活的关心和熟悉，进行卫生知识的普及工作，推动了群众性卫生工作的开展。四川省温江县万春人民公社的一些卫生人员跟班参加食堂工作，同炊事员一起商量改进了烹调技术，安置了沙滤缸，改善了饮水卫生。一年来，各地人民公社反复地、大力地进行了“四员”的卫生训练，并通过受训练的炊事员、保育员、保健员、接生员，加强对公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业的卫生管理和疫情报告工作。
    以人民公社为中心的农村卫生工作网的建立，为我国在农村中普及卫生事业奠定了基础，也是我国整个卫生事业在农村实现人民公社化后的新发展。今后人民公社的卫生事业将会获得更大的发展。
