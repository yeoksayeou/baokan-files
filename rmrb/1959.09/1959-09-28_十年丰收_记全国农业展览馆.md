    Ten Years of Bumper Harvests
     – A Record of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall
    By Our Correspondent Xú Mù
      Good News of Bumper Harvests
    As we approach the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, celebrating ten years of agricultural bumper harvests, has opened.
    On either side of the exhibition hall's square, beneath the tall five-star red flags, stand two colossal statues, each over seven meters high. One is a group portrait of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and the other is a group portrait of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The groups surround a leaping horse, drumming and cymbaling, in a state of surging forward. This depicts the "Good News of the People's Commune's Bumper Harvests."
    The newly built National Agricultural Exhibition Hall, with its magnificent buildings and dozens of spacious and bright exhibition halls displaying tens of thousands of exhibits, is a comprehensive report on the ten years of agricultural development in our country. It is the good news of a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as emerging rural small-scale industries, sent by all parts of the country and five hundred million peasants to the capital; it is the good news of bumper harvests sent by the people's communes across the country after a year of operation.
    First, let us look at the good news of bumper harvests from many people's communes.
    The Xinmin Commune of Xinfan County, Sichuan, is displaying its products here. Its exhibits, encompassing various agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery products, as well as commune-run industrial and handicraft products, number in the hundreds, occupying a large central area of the left-side exhibition hall in the Comprehensive Hall. It joyfully reports the comprehensive bumper harvest in industry and agriculture achieved in the year since its establishment. The Anfeng Commune of Anyang County, Henan, is displaying its abundant industrial raw materials such as cotton and hemp, as well as various other agricultural and livestock products. This commune is located in a well-known cotton-producing area, which has historically suffered from food shortages. However, the exhibits demonstrate that this situation has changed after the Great Leap Forward and communization. Last year, the Anfeng Commune not only increased grain and cotton production but also had surplus grain.
    All the exhibits from the people's communes illustrate that diversified operations in rural areas have developed after communization, and small-scale industries and mining have also developed. For example, the Lutun Commune of Gaiping County, Liaoning, which had only a small blast furnace and a small hardware factory before communization, now presents a dazzling array of industrial and mining products. From nearly a hundred medium and small-sized farm tools to the precision lead screws on steel rolling mills, from colorful local fertilizers to emerald green fluorite and glittering mica, from various leather goods and woven products to coke used for smelting, all bear the mark of the Lutun Commune. The explanatory sign next to the exhibits states that the commune is expected to produce 80,000 farm tools this year, extract 17,000 tons of ore, and the industrial output value will account for 28.6% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The Ulanmaodu Commune of the Horqin Right Front Banner in Inner Mongolia, which was formerly mainly engaged in animal husbandry, is not only exhibiting its abundant livestock products but also exhibiting agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and millet, which are now more than self-sufficient after communization.
    The good news of bumper harvests from the people's communes fully demonstrates the tremendous changes in our country's rural areas. Here is displayed the great journey of the Party leading five hundred million peasants, from land reform, through the cooperative movement, to the people's communes. Over the past ten years, the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries has developed rapidly along with this great journey. Here, people can see another good news of bumper harvests, which is the good news of ten years, in the form of more than a dozen huge leaping forward charts. The figures and rising arrows in each chart are awe-inspiring. The facts they report are: If the total value of agricultural production in our country is taken as 100 in 1949, it was 231 in 1958, and according to plan, it will be 255 this year. The total grain output of the country was only over 200 billion jin in 1949, while it was 500 billion jin in 1958. Cotton increased 3.7 times by 1958, and various crops such as jute, soybeans, peanuts, sugarcane, sugar beets, flue-cured tobacco, tea, and silkworm cocoons increased by one time, some by several times, and the most by 14 times by 1958. Animal husbandry and both pigs and sheep have more than doubled, and aquatic products have increased eightfold. Over the past decade, the forest area in our country has greatly increased, and the afforestation area in ten years is equivalent to ninety times the total afforestation area in the two decades from 1910 to 1935 before liberation. Over the past decade, the irrigated area of farmland has more than tripled compared to before liberation.
      A Prosperous Motherland
    Everyone knows that our motherland has beautiful mountains and rivers, and abundant resources. However, after you have seen our Crop Hall, Horticultural and Special Products Hall, Animal Husbandry Hall, Forestry Hall, Aquatic Products Hall, and People's Commune Industry Hall, you will deeply feel: How inadequate our past understanding was!
    Here you will see: Our agriculture has a long history, and the variety of crops is so rich and colorful. Whether it is cereals, legumes, tuber crops, cotton and hemp fiber crops, oil crops, sugar crops, the world-famous silk and tea, a variety of temperate and tropical fruits, seasonal melons and vegetables, oil palm, coconut, rubber, citronella, and other tropical and subtropical cash crops, thousands of kinds of medicinal materials and tobacco leaves, etc., none of them is not complete in type and abundant in variety. There are more than 130,000 varieties of cereals alone, of which nearly 600 are improved varieties.
    Our country has cold-temperate forests, subtropical dense forests on Hainan Island, various coniferous forests, broad-leaved forests, bamboo forests, and underwater forests. Forest resources are also very rich. Over the past decade, surveys have discovered many forest seas that no one knew about in the past, discovered many rare tree species and precious timber, and also discovered the metasequoia, which has long been extinct in most parts of the world. The improved breed poultry and livestock exhibition area attached to the Animal Husbandry Hall is like a zoo. Here are the long-renowned Sanhe horses, Qinchuan cattle, Guanzhong donkeys, Tan sheep known for their lambskins, Xinjiang fine-wool sheep successfully bred in our country, the famous Xinjin pigs, Neijiang pigs, Ningxiang pigs, as well as the plump Beijing ducks, tall lion-headed geese, etc.
    In the Aquatic Products Hall, you will see how prosperous our country's two major aquatic groups, seawater and freshwater, are. Since liberation, seaweed, laver, various algae, and other marine plants have flourished in the coastal areas of our country, and there are also many precious pearl shells, making you feel that our ocean is truly a treasure trove.
    Our country's rural handicrafts: embroidery, weaving, bamboo ware, pottery, brewing, etc., were greatly damaged before liberation, and have gradually recovered and developed over the past ten years. From the Comprehensive Hall and the People's Commune Industry Hall, you will see that various regions of our country have their own special crafts, and various regions have their own exquisite special products. With the development of industry in the people's communes, these crafts have become more prosperous. At the same time, you will see an exciting change, that is, since communization, rural industry is not just handicrafts. Now rural areas have various modern industries, including metallurgy, machinery, chemical industry, and other industries, producing many industrial products that serve agriculture and life.
      The Great Leap Forward
    Entering the Crop Hall, the first thing you see is a huge peacock opening its screen, made of various ears of grain. Over the past decade, the increase in production of various grain crops in our country has been as colorful and splendid as a peacock opening its screen. Rice production in our country has greatly developed. The planting area of rice has expanded, from the south to the north, to the Mohe area of Heilongjiang at 53 degrees north latitude, and to the Pamir Plateau on the roof of the world. The area planting double-cropping rice in the south has expanded to the north, and the high-yielding japonica rice in the north has expanded to the south. The average yield per unit area of rice has greatly increased. The high yields of thousands and thousands of jin that have appeared in various places during the Great Leap Forward radiate brilliant light in the exhibition hall.
    Here you will see many products of the Great Leap Forward, that is, a wheat king with 327 tillers on one plant, a cotton tree that is more than two meters high and bears 2,200 cotton bolls, multi-eared sorghum and corn, sweet potatoes that yield tens of thousands of jin per mu, as well as rapeseed kings, barley kings, and high-yield records of various crops, etc.
    The products of the Great Leap Forward are mainly in the Water Conservancy Hall, the Production Increase Measures Hall, and the Tool Hall. In these halls, you will see the soaring enthusiasm of our country's peasants, and see their endless creativity in daring to think and act and emancipate their minds. You will see how, since 1958, our country's peasants have made high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way, built countless large and small reservoirs, impounded hundreds of millions of mountain springs, and how they have diverted river water to the mountains. You will also see how our country's peasants have broken superstitions and turned over the cultivated land, created countless local fertilizers, local pesticides, and improved farm tools. You will also see how they have used the power of the collective and the wisdom of the collective to overcome various natural disasters, how to predict the weather, how to control disastrous weather such as wind, hail, and cold freezing, and how to eliminate many diseases and insect pests that harm crops. Here, you will see the great achievements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture put forward by the Party, and see the development of mass agricultural science and technology work in our country.
    There is also a huge statue in the hall of the Exhibition Hall’s Comprehensive Hall, depicting Chairman Mao talking kindly to a peasant family. The husband, wife, and their children are all intently looking at Chairman Mao. It vividly illustrates that our country's peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words and the Party's words, and advance victoriously under the guidance of the Party. Over the past decade, they have already traveled a great journey under the guidance of the Party and achieved brilliant achievements. Our country's rural areas have already realized the incomparably superior people's commune system.
    Where to advance further? The exhibition hall tells you: That is to follow the general line, along the road of the Great Leap Forward, and continue the Great Leap Forward.

    十年丰收
     ——记全国农业展览馆
    本报记者　徐木
      丰收的喜报
    建国十周年大庆到来，喜报十年农业丰收的全国农业展览馆开幕了。
    展览馆广场左右两侧，高高的五星红旗下面，有两座高达七米多的巨大的塑像。一座是工农商学兵群像，另一座是农林牧副渔群像。群像簇拥着跃进的马，击鼓鸣钹，作向前涌进的状态。这就塑造了“喜报人民公社丰收”。
    新建成的全国农业展览馆这次首次展出的，一大群宏伟的大厦，几十个宽敞明亮的陈列大厅陈列着的几万件展品，就是我国农业十年发展的一个总汇报。它是全国各地、五亿农民给首都送来的农林牧副渔各业和新兴的农村小型工业全面丰收的喜报；是全国人民公社送来的它们办社一年的丰收喜报。
    首先让我们看看许多人民公社的丰收喜报。
    四川新繁县新民公社在这里陈列着它的产品。它陈列的农林牧副渔各业和社办工业、手工业的产品多达几百件，占了综合馆左侧陈列大厅中心的一大片，喜报它办社一年来工农各业获得的全面丰收。河南安阳县安丰公社陈列着它盛产的棉花、大麻等工业原料产品和其他各种农畜产品。这个公社所在地是著名的棉产区，一向粮食不足。但是，展出的事实说明，大跃进和公社化后，这个形势已经变化。去年安丰公社不仅粮食和棉花增产，而且有了余粮。
    所有人民公社的展品都说明，公社化后农村多种经营发展了，小型工矿业也发展了。例如公社化前，只有一个小红炉、一个小五金厂的辽宁盖平县芦屯公社，现在陈列的工矿产品都是琳琅满目，从近百件中、小型农具到轧钢机上精细的拉盖机丝杠，从五颜六色的土化肥到翠绿色的萤石、闪闪发光的云母，从各种皮制品、编织品到冶炼用的焦炭，都带有芦屯公社的标记。展品旁的说明牌写着，预计这个社今年将生产农具八万件，开采矿石一万七千吨，工业产值将占工农业总产值的28.6％。过去以畜牧为主的内蒙古科尔沁右翼前旗乌兰毛都公社，除展出它的丰富的畜产品外，还展出了公社化后自给有余的水稻、小麦、谷子等农产品。
    人民公社的丰收喜报充分显示了我国农村的巨大变化。这里展出了党领导五亿农民，从土地改革，经过合作化运动到人民公社化的伟大历程。十年来，农、林、牧、副、渔各业生产就随着这个伟大的历程猛烈地向前发展了。人们在这里可以看到另一个丰收的喜报，那是十年的喜报，是十几幅巨大的跃进图表。每一幅的数字和上升的箭头都是动人心魄的。它们所报道的事实是：我国农业生产的总值如以1949年为一百，1958年就是二百三十一，而今年按计划将是二百五十五。全国粮食总产量1949年仅二千多亿斤，而1958年是五千亿斤。棉花到1958年就增长了三点七倍，黄洋麻、大豆、花生、甘蔗、甜菜、烤烟、茶叶、蚕茧等各种农作物到1958年，有的增长了一倍，有的几倍，最多的十四倍。畜牧业和猪、羊都增加了一倍多，水产品增加了八倍。十年来我国森林面积大大地增加了，十年造林面积相当于解放前1910到1935年二十几年造林总面积的九十倍。十年来农田灌溉面积比解放前多了三倍以上。
      富饶的祖国
    谁都知道，祖国的锦绣山河，地大物博。但是，当你看到了我们的农作物馆、园艺特产馆、畜牧馆、林业馆、水产馆和人民公社工业馆之后，你会深切地感到：过去的了解多么不够啊！
    在这里你将看到：我国农业的历史悠久，作物种类是那么丰富多采。无论禾谷类、豆类、薯类作物，棉麻纤维作物、油料作物、糖料作物，驰名世界的丝茶，多种温带果品和热带果品，四季不同的瓜菜，油棕、椰子、橡胶、香茅等各种热带、亚热带经济作物，千百种药材和烟叶等等，无一种不是种类齐全，品种繁多。仅仅禾谷类的品种就有十三万多种，其中良种有近六百种。
    我国有寒温带森林，有海南岛的亚热带的密林，有各种针叶林、阔叶林、竹林，还有海底森林。森林资源也是很丰富的。十年察勘发现了许多过去没有人知道的林海，发现了不少稀有的树种和珍贵的木材，还发现了世界大部地区早已绝迹了的水杉。畜牧馆附设的良种禽畜展览场像一个动物园。这里有久享盛誉的三河马、秦川牛、关中驴，有以羔皮著称的滩羊，有我国培育成功的新疆细毛羊，有著名的新金猪、内江猪、宁乡猪，以及肥美的北京鸭、高大的狮头鹅等等。
    在水产馆里你会看到我国海水、淡水两大水族多么繁荣昌盛。解放以来，海带、紫菜、各种海藻等海产植物，在我国沿海繁荣地发展起来了，这里还有不少珍贵珠贝，使你感到我国海洋真是宝库。
    我国农村的手工艺：刺绣、编织、竹器、陶器、酿造等等，解放前遭到了很大摧残，十年来又逐渐恢复发展起来了。从综合馆和人民公社工业馆里你会看到，我国各地有各地的特种工艺，各地有各地的精美特产。随着人民公社办工业，这些工艺更繁荣了。同时，你将看到一个令人兴奋的变化，那就是公社化以来，农村工业不只是手工艺了。现在农村有了各种现代工业，有冶金、机械、化工等等各种工业，生产着不少为农业、为生活服务的工业产品。
      大跃进
    走进农作物馆首先看到一只巨大的、用各种谷穗扎成的孔雀开屏。十年来，我国各种粮食作物的增产，正像孔雀开屏一样五彩灿烂。我国水稻生产大大发展了。稻谷的种植地区扩大了，从南方发展到了北方，到了北纬五十三度的黑龙江漠河地区，到了世界屋顶帕米尔高原上。南方种植双季稻的地区向北发展了，北方的高产粳稻向南发展了。稻谷的平均单位面积产量大大提高了。大跃进中各地出现的千斤、几千斤的高产量，在展览大厅中散发着灿烂的光辉。
    这里你将看到不少大跃进的产物，那就是一株分蘖了三百二十七穗的小麦王，一株高达两米多结棉二千二百个的棉花树，多穗的高粱、玉米，亩产几万斤的大甘薯，以及油菜王、大麦王，各种作物的高产纪录等等。
    大跃进的产物主要还在水利馆、增产措施馆和工具馆内。在这些馆内，你将看到我国农民的冲天干劲，看到他们敢想敢干解放思想的无穷创造。看到1958年以来，我国农民怎样让高山低头，让河水让路，修建了无数大小水库，拦蓄了亿万山泉，以及把河水怎样引到了山上。你还会看到我国农民怎样打破迷信把耕地翻了身，创造了无数的土制化肥、土制农药、改良农具。你还会看到他们怎样用集体的力量，集体的智慧，战胜了各种自然灾害，怎样预测天气，怎样控制风、雹、寒冻等灾害性的天气；以及消灭了不少的为害农作物的病虫。在这里，你将看到党所提出的农业“八字宪法”的伟大成就，看到我国群众性农业科学技术工作的发展。
    展览馆综合馆大厅里也有一座巨大的塑像，塑着毛主席正在亲切地同一个农民家庭谈话。丈夫、妻子和他们的孩子都聚精会神地望着毛主席。它生动地说明我国农民是听毛主席的话，听党的话，在党的指引下胜利前进的。十年来，他们已经在党的指引下走了伟大的历程，取得了辉煌的成就。我国农村已经实现了无比优越的人民公社化。
    向那里进一步前进呢？展览馆告诉你：那就是遵循着总路线，沿着大跃进的道路，继续大跃进。
