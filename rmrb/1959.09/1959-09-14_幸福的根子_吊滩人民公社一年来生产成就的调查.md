The Root of Happiness
——An Investigation into the Production Achievements of the Diaotan People's Commune Over the Past Year
By our reporters Sun Min and Wang Tiqiang

The Diaotan People's Commune in Hezheng County, Gansu Province, has achieved astonishing results in the past year. From January to July this year, the total production value of the commune reached 2,020,000 yuan, an increase of 80% compared to the total annual output value of 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward. The fact that this commune's production has leaped forward powerfully proves that even under extremely harsh natural conditions, a very weak production base, and very complex ethnic relations, people's communes can rapidly change these backward conditions.

The Diaotan People's Commune was formed by merging twelve advanced agricultural cooperatives. The commune has 2,330 households, 13,599 people, with Han, Hui, and Dongxiang ethnic groups each accounting for about one-third of the population. The commune owns more than 42,000 mu of land and large areas of mountain forest. The area is located in a high-altitude and cold region, with an average altitude of 1,980 meters, and the frost-free period is only 95 to 130 days a year. The south has more rain, while the north is arid, and there are floods, droughts, and hailstorms every year. Before liberation, the reactionary ruling class often provoked ethnic killings, and there was a local saying, "A minor disturbance every ten years, a major disturbance every thirty years." Natural and man-made disasters placed the people in dire straits. After liberation, through social reforms and the agricultural cooperativization movement, grain production increased year by year: in 1957, the yield per mu was 257 jin, an increase of 45% compared to 1949; in 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the yield per mu soared to 307 jin. People's lives generally improved, but on the eve of communization, 8% of the population, households with more labor but less income, still could not make ends meet and relied on government relief.

Only a year after the establishment of the commune, great changes have taken place in all aspects, and industry and agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations) have seen a flourishing scene. The average yield per mu of more than 33,000 mu of wheat, broad beans, and highland barley harvested in summer was 559 jin, an increase of 82% compared to last year, and the total output increased by 95%. The autumn fields are estimated to increase by at least 80% compared to last year. After completing the grain purchase task, which has increased twofold compared to last year, and retaining enough seeds and rations, each person in the commune still has more than 400 jin of reserve grain. The industrial output value in the first seven months of this year was equal to 127% of the total output value of last year; sideline occupations were equal to 130% of last year. Statistics at the end of July showed that large livestock increased by 11% compared to the highest level before communization in history; livestock and poultry increased nearly fourfold. Now, on average, each household has 2.3 head of large livestock and 23 chickens and ducks; each Han household has 3.2 pigs, and each Hui and Dongxiang household has 3.5 sheep. According to the summer harvest pre-distribution plan that has been discussed and approved, in addition to the food supply, each of the commune's 6,014 laborers can receive an average of 116 yuan in wages. It is expected that at the end of the year, each person can still receive 174 yuan in wages. Now every family has savings in the credit cooperative, and the total amount of savings in the commune is equal to 230% of that at the end of 1958. The sales volume of the supply and marketing cooperative in the first seven months of this year increased by 51% compared to the same period last year. The sales of cloth alone increased by more than 75,000 chi, with an average increase of more than 5 chi and 5 cun of cloth per person.

Why have such great changes occurred in such a short period of one year?

The People of All Ethnic Groups Unite

Ethnic unity is the prerequisite and foundation for developing production here. Before liberation, once ethnic riots occurred, production would stop completely, and the original life would be severely damaged. After liberation, under the Party's policy of ethnic unity and equality among all ethnic groups, the people of all ethnic groups began to establish a friendship of mutual assistance in production, and no major disputes have occurred. However, due to the narrow scope and weak strength of the advanced cooperatives, the people of all ethnic groups could not cooperate in a larger scope to develop production. The Hualiugou Dongxiang ethnic agricultural cooperative had backward production technology, did not know how to sow in rows, and was not used to weeding. It was known as the "straw bag crop." In 1958, its output was only more than 200 jin. The Dashanzhuang and Ketuo Hui ethnic agricultural cooperatives were mostly dry land. In 1958, in the construction of water conservancy projects, a large canal was designed along the mountain, which was planned to irrigate 6,000 mu of land. However, because the upper reaches of the canal would occupy the fertile land of the Diaotan and Zhongxin Han ethnic agricultural cooperatives, these two cooperatives did not agree, so it could not be built, and they had to build a small canal instead, irrigating more than 2,000 mu of land. In addition, there were many unresolvable contradictions in the rational use of mountain forests, roads, and so on. All these limited the development of productive forces and affected the further improvement of people's lives.

After communization, the twelve agricultural cooperatives formed a unified whole, and many contradictions were readily resolved. In February this year, the Diaotan and Zhongxin Han ethnic production teams sent 400 laborers to actively dig the upper section of the canal on their own cultivated land. The Dashanzhuang and Ketuo Hui ethnic teams completed the lower section of the canal, and the Cheba team extended the canal by five *hua li*. A 35-*li* long canal jointly dug by three ethnic groups appeared, irrigating more than 8,000 mu of land. The average yield per mu of broad beans in the Ketuo team's paddy fields increased by one and a half times compared to last year. At the beginning of spring sowing, the Diaotan team sent 43 Han elders to support the Dongxiang ethnic farmers of the Hualiugou team in sowing in rows with seed drills, not only changing all crops from broadcasting to row sowing, but also helping the Dongxiang ethnic group train 23 skilled seed drill operators in the process of labor. This year, the Han commune members helped the Hui and Dongxiang ethnic groups train a total of more than 340 technical experts. The people of all ethnic groups have developed close socialist ethnic relations on the basis of common labor and common prosperity, which has provided conditions for the smooth development of production.

Unified Planning, Rational Utilization of Cultivated Land

The Diaotan Commune is more than 70 *li* long from north to south, and there are great differences in climate, rainfall, and soil. Often, the same crop, the same technical measures, but the yield varies by several times. For example, the millet in the Diaotan team in the south has a yield of only 50 to 60 jin per mu, while the Li Jiaping area in the north produces more than 200 jin; however, the broad bean yield in Li Jiaping is only a quarter of that in Diaotan. Despite this, in order to meet the diverse food habits of the members during the advanced cooperative period, it was still necessary to plant some low-yielding crops.

After the establishment of the commune, with the help of the relevant departments of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, a soil survey was conducted to clarify the base. The Diaotan, Zhongxin, and other eight production teams in the south are mostly dark soil with high humus content, more rain, and cool soil, suitable for planting wheat, broad beans, and highland barley, but not suitable for millet; the Li Jiaping and other three production teams in the north are mostly white loess, with less moisture and humus, suitable for planting wheat, highland barley, and potatoes, but not suitable for broad beans. Based on these natural conditions, the commune, after soliciting the opinions of the farmers, proposed a plan for the rational use of land and planting according to local conditions. During the discussion, the old farmers added the suggestion of selecting fine seeds according to local conditions, and decided to plant Diaodan wheat, which has a short growth period, is resistant to waterlogging, short in stature, large in ears, thick in stalks, and does not lodge, in the southern high-altitude, cold, and humid areas; drought-resistant red wheat was promoted in the northern arid areas. In order to take care of the diverse food habits of the local farmers, the commune adopted the opinions of the members and signed grain exchange contracts through consultation among the production teams. Based on the principle of equal value exchange, the production teams in the central and southern regions exchanged broad beans for millet in the north, so that all members of the commune could drink millet porridge and eat broad bean sauce. After the rational planting of crops, the estimated average yield of millet in the north is 402 jin, an increase of one and a half times compared to the average yield of millet in the entire commune last year; the broad beans in the central and southern regions increased by 87% compared to last year, with a yield of 620 jin per mu.

In addition, the commune's grass mountains are all distributed in the Diaotan production team area in the south; the middle and northern teams lack grass mountains and forage. During the advanced agricultural cooperative period, the grass mountains could not be used publicly. The southern region could not use up the forage, and the mountain grass was allowed to grow and wither on its own; the middle and northern regions had to allocate more than 2,400 mu of land to plant forage for livestock, pigs, and sheep. After communization, a rational plan for the unified use of grass mountains was formulated, saving 2,484 mu of feed land this year and converting it to planting wheat, broad beans, and other crops, increasing grain production by more than 1.5 million jin.

Arrange Labor, Develop Diversified Economy

After the establishment of the people's commune, it provided a material foundation for the comprehensive development of various economies in terms of labor and capital. In the past, this area only engaged in agriculture and some scattered mountain goods processing, and the members privately raised some livestock and poultry, and the scope of production was very narrow. After communization, the Party committee, based on the four criteria of the amount of labor and capital used, the difficulty of technology, and the needs of the country, formulated a plan for the comprehensive development of industry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and transportation, and divided the scope of operation at all levels, investing 25% of the labor force and more than 80,000 yuan in funds to develop various productions. Now there are four factories run by the commune and 69 factories (yards) run by the teams, and 88 vehicles engaged in sideline occupations. The total industrial output value in the first seven months of this year was more than 78,000 yuan, an increase of 27% compared to the total output value of last year. The development of these undertakings has greatly supported agricultural production and met the needs of the country for certain materials. The commune-run farm tool factory has produced more than 8,000 pieces of various advanced farm tools (including some vehicles) this year. The team-run building materials factory, in addition to supplying the commune with 926 tile-roofed houses (equal to 13% of the commune's original housing), also supplied the market with huge amounts of bricks, tiles, and lime. The eight sewing groups, with only 22 female laborers, sewed more than 3,300 pieces of clothing in half a year, greatly reducing the housework of women.

The Diaotan People's Commune is located in a high-altitude and cold area, with a short frost-free period and frequent natural disasters. Therefore, it is necessary to plant and harvest at a high speed. However, during the advanced cooperative period, each cooperative lacked manpower and animal power, and spring sowing generally took 20 days, and summer harvesting was prolonged to more than a month. Last year, 70% to 80% of the wheat sprouted due to the prolonged time of cutting, pulling, and transporting. The Party committee of the commune accepted the lessons of previous years, organized the cooperation of the entire commune according to the principle of equal value exchange, and signed cooperation contracts. Each contracting team and production team formulates a labor allocation plan according to the needs of the production season, and then signs a cooperation contract at the cooperation meeting held at the next higher level. The commune and the production team organize orderly cooperation according to the contract. The Diaotan People's Commune has a wide range of cooperation, many types, and a strict but flexible organization. The scope of cooperation includes cooperation in various industries, cooperation between teams, material cooperation, joint operations, and so on. Usually, agricultural production only occupies 65% of the total labor force, but during the busy farming season, all other industries immediately stop and give way. On August 8, the Diaotan production team received a telephone call from the Dalang team requesting support. Within two hours, the production team leader Li Sen led 100 strong laborers and 45 pairs of livestock to set off. Because the cooperation was carried out more widely and more orderly than last year, this year each team completed the summer planting task in 12 days, and the summer harvest was rushed to complete in only 10 days. The summer fields after harvest have been generally plowed twice.

Cooperation has tapped huge labor potential. In the first half of this year, the number of working days in the entire commune increased by 60% compared to the same period last year. More than 33,000 mu of summer fields generally reached four hoeings and three harrowings, and 3,600 mu of high-yield fields reached five hoeings and four harrowings. Last year, there was only one hoeing and two harrowings. First-class fields account for 83% of the entire commune's 42,000 mu of summer and autumn fields, and third-class fields only account for 0.6%. In addition, more than 7,200 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed and planted, which alone can increase grain production by nearly 4 million jin.

Strengthen Education, Live Frugally

The great superiority of the people's commune has opened up a road to comprehensive prosperity in the countryside. However, it is people who complete all production tasks, so the Party committee of the commune always pays attention to the work of people from beginning to end. This work starts from both life and political and ideological education, and is carried out alternately.

After communization, the poor appearance of the countryside has been basically changed. Kang Zenglu, who has only one laborer to support six people, has relied on government relief every year since liberation, and in 1957, he overspent 28.4 yuan in the agricultural cooperative. In the first year of communization, in addition to the family eating, he also received 137 yuan in wages. In the first half of this year, he has bought more than 11 zhang of cloth, a red blanket, and has savings in the credit cooperative. In half a month, he will be able to receive 194 yuan in wages for the first half of the year. The living conditions of the members have also improved significantly. In the past, due to the many historical killings between ethnic groups here, once a struggle occurred, houses and property would be destroyed by war, so the living conditions were very poor. Of the 2,300 households in the entire commune, only the landlords and temples had more than 50 tile-roofed houses in the past, and the remaining 7,000 were low-pitched thatched houses. After communization, ethnic unity is as close as brothers and sisters, labor and funds are sufficient. In the first half of the year, 926 new-style tile-roofed houses with glass windows were built, accounting for one-eighth of the original housing. It is planned to convert all old-fashioned thatched houses into new-style tile-roofed houses within three years. Due to the rapid rise in living standards, many canteens experienced waste in the spring of this year, competing to see who ate more white flour, more meat, and more oil. The fourth canteen of the Xinji production team, with 160 people eating, ate 13 sheep and 5 disabled cattle in one month.

The commune promptly strengthened the education of frugality and household management. It organized an exhibition on frugality and household management, rewarded models of frugality and household management and saving deposits, and organized old members who had experienced the great famine in 1929 to tell young people about the situation at that time to conduct education on saving. Since then, all canteens have implemented a meal ticket system, with settlement every ten days. In the past six months, the entire commune has saved a total of more than 2.5 million jin of grain, and three production teams are still eating the surplus grain from last year.

The various production undertakings of the Diaotan People's Commune are constantly rising rapidly. Following the unprecedented bumper harvest of summer fields, a bumper harvest of autumn fields is also in sight. According to the old farmers' estimate, it can increase by at least 80% compared to last year. At present, the labor force of the entire commune is divided into three armies: one group of people is carrying out autumn field processing and plowing the winter sowing land; another 1,500 people are entering the mountains to engage in sideline production, planning to earn 60,000 yuan this winter, an average of 26 yuan per household; and another 300 people are cutting wood and burning bricks and tiles, planning to build another 1,000 new houses this autumn and next spring, and build a new countryside ahead of schedule in 1961.

Now, whether it is the Hui, Han, or Dongxiang people, they all call the people's commune the root of happiness. In addition to happily talking about this year's achievements during production breaks, people are also confidently discussing next year's leap forward plan.

    幸福的根子
    ——吊滩人民公社一年来生产成就的调查
    本报记者　孙民　王体强
    甘肃省和政县吊滩人民公社，一年来取得了惊人的成就。今年1月至7月，全社生产总产值达二百零二万元，比大跃进的1958年的全年产值增加了80％。这个公社生产跃进的事实，有力的证明：纵然在自然条件极端恶劣、生产基础极为薄弱、民族关系非常复杂的情况下，人民公社也可以迅速改变这些落后的面貌。
    吊滩公社是由十二个高级农业社合并建成的。全社两千三百三十户，一万三千五百九十九人，汉族、回族、东乡族各占人口的三分之一左右。全社拥有四万二千多亩土地和大片的山林，地处高寒，平均海拔一千九百八十公尺，全年无霜期只有九十五天至一百三十天。南部多雨，北部干旱，每年出现涝、旱、雹灾。解放前，反动统治阶级经常挑起民族仇杀，当地素有“十年一小乱，三十年一大乱”的谚语。天灾人祸置人民于水深火热之中。解放后，经过社会改革和农业合作化运动，粮食产量逐年上升：1957年亩产二百五十七斤，比1949年增加了45％；大跃进的1958年，亩产量激增到三百零七斤。人民生活普遍上升；但到公社化前夕，仍有8％的人口多劳力少的户入不敷出，靠政府救济生活。
    公社建立刚刚一年，各方面就大大改观，工、农（包括林、牧、副各业）业出现了一片繁荣景象。夏季收割的三万三千多亩小麦、蚕豆、青稞，平均亩产五百五十九斤，比去年增加82％，总产增加95％。秋田最低估计比去年能增加80％。全社除完成比去年增加了两倍的购粮任务和留足籽种、口粮外，每人还有储备粮四百多斤。今年前七个月的工业产值，等于去年全年产值的127％；副业等于去年全年的130％。7月底的统计，大牲畜比历史上最高的公社化前夕还增加了11％；家畜家禽增加了将近四倍。现在平均每户有大牲畜二点三头，有鸡鸭二十三只，每户汉民有猪三点二口，每户回民、东乡民有三只半羊。按照已经讨论通过的夏收预分方案，除伙食供给部分外，全社六千零十四名劳动力，平均每人可领到一百十六元工资。预计年底决算时，每人还能领到工资一百七十四元。现在家家在信用社都有存款，全社存款数等于1958年年底的230％。供销社今年前七个月的销售量，比去年同期增长了51％。仅布匹就多销了七万五千多尺，平均每人多买了五尺五寸多布。
    在短短的一年内，为什么会出现这样大的变化？
    各族人民团结起来
    民族团结在这里是发展生产的前提和基础。解放前，一旦发生民族暴乱，生产全部停顿，原有的生活也受到了严重的破坏。解放后，在党的民族团结、各族平等的政策下，各族人民开始建立了互助生产的友谊，没有发生过重大纠纷。但是，由于高级社范围狭窄，力量小，限制着各族人民不能在更大的范围内协作发展生产。桦柳沟东乡族农业社，生产技术落后，不会条播，不惯锄草，人称“草包庄稼”，1958年的产量也只有二百多斤。大山庄和科拓两个回民农业社，大部是旱地，1958年兴修水利中，设计了一条傍山大渠，计划可浇地六千亩。但因为渠道上游要占用吊滩、中心两个汉民农业社的良田，这两个社不同意，结果没能修成，只好改修了一条小渠，浇地两千多亩。另外，在合理使用山林、道路等方面，也有很多无法解决的矛盾。这些都限制了生产力的发展，影响到人民生活的进一步改善。
    公社化后，十二个农业社结成了一个统一的整体，许多矛盾迎刃而解。今年2月，吊滩和中心两个汉民生产队，出动四百名劳动力，在自己的耕地上主动挖成了上段渠道，大山庄、科拓回民队完成了渠道下段，车巴队又延长了渠道五华里。一条三个民族共同开凿的三十五里长的大渠出现了，共浇地八千多亩。科拓队的水地蚕豆，亩产量平均比去年提高一倍半。春播开始，吊滩队派出四十三名汉族老农，支援桦柳沟队东乡族农民摇耧条播，不但把全部作物改撒播为条播，还在劳动过程中帮助东乡族培养了二十三个摇耧能手。全社汉族社员，今年共帮助回族、东乡族培养各种技术能手三百四十多名。各族人民在共同劳动、共同富裕的基础上，产生了亲密无间的社会主义的民族关系，这种关系为顺利地发展生产提供了条件。
    统一规划　合理利用耕地
    吊滩公社南北狭长七十多里，气候、雨量、土壤都有很大的差别。往往同一种作物，同样的技术措施，产量却相差几倍。如南部吊滩队的糜谷，亩产只有五六十斤，北部李家坪一带却产二百多斤；但李家坪的蚕豆产量，却又只有吊滩产量的四分之一。尽管如此，高级社时期为了满足社员食粮多样性的习惯，还不得不种一些低产的庄稼。
    公社建立后，在临夏回族自治州有关部门的帮助下，进行了土壤普查，摸清了底子。南部吊滩、中心等八个生产队是含腐植质多的大黑土，雨水多，地性凉，宜植小麦、蚕豆、青稞，不宜种糜谷；北部李家坪等三个生产队，多是白麻土，含水分、腐植质少，宜种小麦、青稞、洋芋，不宜种蚕豆。公社根据这一自然条件，经过征求农民意见，提出了合理利用土地、因地种植的计划。在讨论中，老农又补充了因地制宜选择良种的意见，决定在南部高寒阴湿地区，种植生长期短、耐涝、身矮、穗大、秆粗、不倒伏的吊旦麦；北部干旱区，推广耐旱的红麦。为了照顾当地农民食粮多样性的习惯，公社采纳社员意见，通过各生产队协商，签订了粮食互换合同。根据等价交换原则，中南部的生产队拿蚕豆换北部的糜谷，使全社社员都能喝上小米稀饭，吃上蚕豆酱。作物合理种植以后，北部的糜谷估产平均四百零二斤，比去年全社的糜谷平均产量提高一倍半；中南部的蚕豆比去年增产87％，亩产六百二十斤。
    另外，这个公社的草山都分布在南部吊滩生产队一带；中部、北部各队没有草山，草料缺乏。高级农业社时期，草山不能公共使用，南部地区草料用不完，任凭山草自长自枯；中部和北部地区却不得不拿出两千四百多亩土地给牲畜、猪、羊种植草料。公社化后，制订了统一使用草山的合理规划，今年就节省出了二千四百八十四亩饲料地，改种小麦、蚕豆等作物，增产粮食一百五十多万斤。
    安排劳力　发展多种经济
    人民公社建立以后，从劳力和资金上提供了全面发展各种经济的物质基础。过去，这一带地区只搞农业和一些零星的山货加工，社员私人饲养一些家畜家禽，生产范围很狭窄。公社化以后，党委根据使用劳力和资金的多少、技术的难易、国家的需要等四条标准，制定了全面发展工业、牧业、副业、运输业的计划，并且划分了各级经营范围，投入25％的劳力和八万多元资金，发展各项生产。现在有社办厂四个、队办厂（场）六十九个，八十八辆搞副业的车子。今年前七个月的工业产值共七万八千多元，比去年全年的产值还增加了27％。这些事业的发展，大大支援了农业生产，满足了国家对某些物资的需要。社办农具厂今年已生产各种先进农具八千多件（包括部分车辆）。队办建筑材料厂，除供应本社修建了九百二十六间瓦房外（等于全社原有房舍的13％），还供应市场巨量的砖瓦石灰。八个缝纫组，只用二十二个妇女劳动力，半年就缝制衣服三千三百多件，大大减轻了妇女的家务劳动。
    吊滩公社由于地处高寒，无霜期短，自然灾害又多，因此必须高速度的快种抢收。但高级社时期，每个社人力畜力不足，春播一般要二十天，夏收拖长到一个月以上。去年有70％到80％的小麦因割、拉、运的时间拖长而生芽。公社党委接受历年的教训，按等价交换原则，组织全社协作，并且订了协作合同。各包产小队和生产队，按照生产季节需要制定劳动调配计划，然后在上一级召开的协作会议上，签订协作合同。公社、生产队按照合同组织有秩序的协作。吊滩公社的协作面广，种类多，组织严密而又灵活。协作范围包括各业协作、各队协作、物资协作、联合作战等。平时，农业生产只占用总劳力的65％，但农忙季节，其他各业立即停车让路。8月8日，吊滩生产队接到大浪队要求支援的电话，两小时内，生产队长李森就率领着一百名强劳力和四十五对牲畜出发了。由于协作比去年更广泛更有秩序地进行，今年各队十二天就完成了夏种任务，夏收只有十天就抢收完了。收割后的夏田，已普遍伏耕两遍。
    协作发掘了巨大的劳动潜力，今年上半年，全社劳动日比去年同期增加了60％。三万三千多亩夏田普遍达到四锄三耙，三千六百亩丰产田五锄四耙。而去年只一锄二耙。全社四万二千多亩夏、秋田，一类田占83％，三类田只占0.6％。另外还开荒增种了七千二百多亩，只此一项就可增产粮食近四百万斤。
    加强教育　勤俭持家
    人民公社的巨大优越性，开拓了农村全面繁荣的道路。但完成一切生产任务的是人，因此公社党委自始至终注意作人的工作。这项工作从生活和政治思想教育两方面着手，同时交错进行。
    公社化后，农村贫困的面貌已经基本改变。六个人吃饭只有一个劳力的康增禄，解放后年年靠政府救济，1957年还超支农业社二十八元四角。公社化的头一年，除全家吃饭外，还领到了一百三十七元工资，今年上半年已买了十一丈多布，一条红毛毯，在信用社里还有存款。半月以后，他又能领到上半年工资一百九十四元。社员的居住条件也有显著改善。过去这里由于历史上民族之间多仇杀事件，一旦发生争斗，房屋财产就毁于兵火，因而居住条件很差。全公社二千三百多户社员，过去只有地主和寺院的五十多间瓦房，其余七千多间都是低矮的草房。公社化后，民族团结亲如手足，劳力、资金充足，上半年就新建镶有玻璃窗户的新式瓦房九百二十六间，占原有房舍的八分之一。计划在三年内将全部旧式草房改为新式瓦房。由于生活迅速上升，今年开春，许多食堂发生了浪费现象，比赛谁家吃的面白，吃的肉多、油多。新集生产队第四食堂，一百六十人吃饭，一个月就吃了十三只羊、五头残牛。
    公社及时地加强了勤俭持家的教育。组织了勤俭持家展览会，奖励了勤俭持家和节约储蓄模范，并组织经过1929年大灾荒的老社员向青年人讲述当时的情景，进行节约教育。此后各食堂都实行了饭票制，十天一结算。半年来，全公社共节约粮食二百五十多万斤，有三个生产队至今还吃着去年的余粮。
    吊滩人民公社的各项生产事业正在一日千里地不断高涨中。继夏田空前大丰收以后，秋田丰收又已在望，据老农的估产，最少能比去年增加80％。目前，全社劳力分成了三路大军，一路人马进行秋田加工和翻耕冬播地；另外有一千五百人进山大搞副业生产，计划今冬收入六万元，平均每户二十六元；还有三百人正在采伐木料，烧砖瓦，计划今秋明春再建设一千间新房子，提前在1961年建设成新农村。
    现在，不管是回民、汉民和东乡族人民，都把人民公社称为幸福的根子。人们在生产之余，不仅喜欢畅谈今年的成就，更充满信心地讨论明年的跃进计划。
