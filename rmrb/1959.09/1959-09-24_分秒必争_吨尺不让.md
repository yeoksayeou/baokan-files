Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd:
	The Jingxi Mining Bureau created new records in crude coal production and tunneling speed in the first and middle ten days of September. Crude coal production exceeded the plan for the first and middle ten days of the month by 9.86%, with an increase of more than 33,000 tons. Total output increased by 25.66% compared with the same period in August; Tunneling completed more than 150% of the plan, an increase of 46.58% compared with the same period in August.

	Under the slogan of "Seizing every second, yielding not an inch, completing the production plan ahead of schedule, and presenting gifts for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country", all the mine workers have launched a vigorous upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. All production mines have set a goal of completing the September plan two to five days ahead of schedule. The Huakeng No. 4 coal mining team of the Muchengjian Mine planned to produce 25,000 tons of coal in September. They resolutely wanted to increase production by 5,000 tons to present gifts for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. As of the 20th, they had increased production by more than 5,000 tons. After the No. 23 tunneling team of the Datai Mine proposed to all tunneling teams in the bureau to complete the entire month's plan half a month ahead of schedule, the three shifts of workers worked closely together and conscientiously promoted advanced experiences such as multi-hole cyclic operations and deep-hole blasting. As a result, they exceeded the entire month's plan by 1.35 meters on the 15th. They are determined to tunnel another 400 meters by the end of the month.
	In the mass upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, leaders at all levels of the mining bureau went to the front line of production to direct. The bureau and the mines have established and improved the leadership duty system. The director and chief engineer of the mining bureau and the directors of various departments take turns on night shifts to grasp the current production and arrange future production, so that the bureau can complete the plan on a daily and ten-day basis.
Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 23rd:
	State-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province overfulfilled the crude coal production plan for the middle ten days of September by more than 128,000 tons.
	The socialist labor competition among the workers of the state-owned coal mines in Datong, Yangquan, Luan, and Xishan has formed a climax before the National Day. In the competition, the mines vigorously promoted advanced experience and technological innovation, which effectively promoted production. Many teams have completed the third quarter production plan ahead of schedule. The number of working faces in the Datong Mining Bureau using advanced experience such as long-tooth discs, blasting coal loading, and steam rapid shifting of slides has increased compared with the previous month; advanced experiences such as three-shift coal production parallel operations and deep-hole tunneling have also been promoted. Because all tunneling teams implemented segmented transportation and four-corner coal loading, the tunneling progress has been greatly improved, preparing coal for more than seven months of mining for the entire bureau. The average daily output of each working face has also increased by 20% compared with the same period last month. Yangquan Mining Bureau's 10 pit entrances and 629 teams, while carrying out opponent competitions and sub-class and sub-section competitions, have realized 70 innovation proposals. The output in the middle ten days of the month exceeded 5,501 tons, and the average daily output increased by 34.9% compared with the same period in August and 20.9% compared with the first ten days of the month.
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 22nd:
	The coal mines under the Handan Mining Bureau of Hebei Province overfulfilled the third quarter crude coal production plan on September 20, producing a total of 580,000 tons of crude coal.
	The workers of this mining bureau put forward the slogan of "Fight hard in the third quarter, overfulfill the crude coal production plan, and welcome the National Day" in July, and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. Focusing on the weak links in production, the workers of each mine promoted more than 20 advanced experiences in coal mining, tunneling, and transportation, which significantly increased the output of crude coal. The Kangercheng Coal Mine had not completed the production plan from January to June. With the help of the Party committee of the Mining Bureau, this mine criticized some leading cadres for emphasizing poor technical conditions, broken roof, and being afraid to boldly promote advanced coal mining methods, and vigorously promoted the artificial section top longwall mining method on the coal mining working face, reversing the situation that the production plan could not be completed for a long time. In the two months up to September 20, the production plan has been overfulfilled on a ten-day basis.
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 22nd:
	The workers of the Lingxi Mine of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province, who have overfulfilled the national coal production plan every month this year, fought hard in August and September, and completed the national production plan for crude coal in the third quarter twelve days ahead of schedule, and the main roadway tunneling plan for the third quarter sixteen days ahead of schedule.
	In August and September, the Party committee of the Lingxi Mine and the general Party branches of each mine continuously organized workers to study the People's Daily editorial "Overcoming Right-leaning Emotions and Practicing Increasing Production and Practicing Economy" and the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and criticized various forms of relaxation among cadres. Leaders at all levels led production in a thorough and meticulous manner, identified advanced models, and vigorously promoted advanced experience. Cadres went deep into the front line of production, worked with workers, and solved key problems in production in a timely manner. Workers generally launched opponent competitions. In this way, the advanced became more advanced, and the backward caught up. For example, the 368 coal mining team, which had not completed the production plan for four consecutive months, also continuously overfulfilled the production plan in the hard battle of August and September.
	Now, all the workers of the Lingxi Mine have put forward: to increase production by 40,000 tons of crude coal and tunnel another 1,959 meters by the end of the month, to present a generous gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

    分秒必争　吨尺不让
    京西矿务局九月上中旬创采掘新纪录
    山西国营煤矿超额完成中旬生产计划
    邯郸矿务局的原煤产量达五十八万吨
    双鸭山岭西矿提前完成第三季度计划
    新华社22日讯　京西矿务局9月上、中旬创造了原煤产量与掘进速度历史上的最高纪录。原煤超额9.86％完成了上中旬计划，增产三万三千多吨，总产量比8月同期增长25.66％；巷道掘进完成计划150％以上，比8月同期提高46.58％。
    在“分秒必争，吨尺不让，提前完成生产计划，向建国十周年献礼”的口号下，全矿职工掀起了轰轰烈烈的增产节约高潮。各生产矿井都提出了提前两天到五天完成9月份计划的奋斗目标。木城涧矿大华坑回采四组9月份计划产煤二万五千吨，他们坚决要增产五千吨向建国十周年献礼，截至20日已增产五千多吨。大台矿掘进二十三组向全局各掘进组提出提前半月完成全月计划的倡议后，三班工人密切团结，认真推行多孔循环作业及深孔爆破等先进经验，结果在15日就超过一点三五米完成了全月计划，他们决心到月底再多掘进四百米。
    在群众性的增产节约高潮中，矿务局的各级领导干部都到生产前线指挥。局与矿都建立和健全了领导值班制度，矿务局局长、总工程师和各处的处长轮流值夜班，抓当前的生产，同时安排以后的生产，使全局按日按旬地完成计划。
    新华社太原23日电　山西省国营煤矿超额十二万八千多吨完成了9月中旬的原煤生产计划。
    大同、阳泉、潞安、西山等国营煤矿职工的社会主义劳动竞赛，在国庆节前形成热潮。竞赛中，各矿大力推广先进经验和革新技术，有力地推动了生产。许多班组已经提前完成第三季度生产计划。大同矿务局各煤矿采用长牙盘、爆破装煤、蒸气快速移溜子等先进经验的工作面，比上月增加；还推广了三班出煤平行作业、深孔掘进等先进经验。由于所有掘进队都实行分段运输及四角装煤，大大提高了掘进进度，为全局准备好可供开采七个多月的煤，每个工作面的平均日产量也比上月同期提高了20％。阳泉矿务局的十个坑口六百二十九个班组在开展对手赛和分班分段竞赛的同时，实现了七十项革新建议，中旬超产五千五百零一吨，平均日产量比8月同期提高34.9％，比上旬提高20.9％。
    新华社天津22日电　河北省邯郸矿务局所属煤矿，在9月20日超额完成了第三季度原煤生产计划，共产原煤五十八万吨。
    这个矿务局的职工，在7月份就提出“大战三季度，超额完成原煤生产计划，迎接国庆”的口号，开展了增产节约运动。各矿职工围绕着生产中的薄弱环节，推行了采煤、掘进、运输等方面的二十多项先进经验，使原煤产量显著提高。康二城煤矿1月至6月份原来都没有完成生产计划。这个矿在矿务局党委帮助下，批判了某些领导干部强调技术条件差、顶板破碎、不敢大胆推广先进采煤方法等右倾保守思想，在采煤工作面大力推广了人工段顶长壁采煤法，扭转了长期不能完成生产计划的局面，到9月20日为止的两个多月来，都按旬地超额完成生产计划。
    新华社哈尔滨22日电　今年月月超额完成国家煤炭生产计划的黑龙江双鸭山煤矿岭西矿职工，大战8、9月，又提前十二天完成第三季度原煤的国家生产计划，提前十六天完成第三季度的主巷掘进计划。
    8、9月份内，岭西矿党委以及各矿井党总支，连续组织职工学习了人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论和党的八届八中全会文件，批判了干部中各种形形色色的松劲情绪。各级领导干部深入细致地领导生产，找出先进标兵，大力推广先进经验。干部们纷纷深入生产第一线，同工人一起劳动，及时解决生产中的关键问题。工人们普遍展开了对手竞赛。这样，先进的更先进，落后的迎头赶上。如一连四个月没有完成生产计划的三六八采煤队，在大战8、9月中，也连续超额完成了生产计划。
    现在，岭西矿全体职工又提出：到月底再增产四万吨原煤，再掘进一千九百五十九米，向建国十周年献厚礼。
