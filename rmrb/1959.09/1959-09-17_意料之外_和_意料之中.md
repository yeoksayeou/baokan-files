"Unexpected" and "Expected"
Sifei

The National Games has only been open for a few days, and good news is constantly coming from the sports field of newcomers surpassing veterans and "weak teams" rising to become "strong teams."

In the basketball finals, the Sichuan team, which ranked eighth in last year's Class A men's teams, has become the only strong team among the twelve teams participating in the basketball finals to maintain an undefeated record of six wins in six games. In the men's volleyball competition, the People's Liberation Army team, the champion of last year's Class A volleyball league, was defeated by the Jiangxi team. In the football finals, the Class A team Shanghai team was defeated by the Class B team Guangdong team with a score of five to one. There are also such phenomena in other events: ping-pong athlete Wang Chuanyao lost to Qiu Wenling of the Yunnan team, and Wu Yanfu, a chess player from Gansu, "checkmated" the famous veteran Hou Yushan. This is a great leap forward situation in China's sports, which is in line with dialectics.

However, faced with this excellent situation where newcomers are exerting their energy and "weak teams" are striving to move up, some people's comments are: unexpected. Most of these people are well-intentioned. This comment reflects their admiration for the amazing speed with which the new forces in China's sports are catching up.

But there are also some other people. The "original intention" and "expectation" of these people was that the newcomers would never be able to surpass the veterans, and the "weak teams" would always be content to be "weaklings." Now, a large number of new forces have broken their "original intention" and "expectation" with practical actions, so these people are greatly "surprised."

For the promoters of socialist sports, the emergence of this situation in sports is entirely within expectations. This is because the new constantly surpasses the old and replaces the old, which is a law of the development of things. Sports, of course, is no exception. In our socialist sports, this development process has been accelerated due to the vigorous promotion of a style of mutual promotion and common improvement, making it a rapid and very common phenomenon to catch up later and for the student to surpass the teacher. This shows that China's young sports are in a prosperous and flourishing period, and a new generation of Chinese athletes is emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. This is the great leap forward in China's sports. This is a good thing that should be greatly written about and celebrated.

Veterans can be defeated by newcomers, and newcomers will slowly become veterans. Therefore, in order to maintain their achievements for as long as possible, whether for veterans or newcomers, the excellent style of not being arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat should be greatly promoted. If the victors and the strong carry the burden of arrogance, they may be transformed into losers and the weak. Things can move towards their opposite, which is also a law of dialectics. If we can remind ourselves at any time, and if everyone can "expect" to be vigilant against arrogance and complacency, then there will be no or as few as possible sudden "unexpected" transformations.

    “意料之外”和“意料之中”
    思飞
    全运会开幕才几天，运动场上不断传来新手赶过老将、“弱队”上升为“强队”的喜讯。
    在篮球决赛中，去年甲级男子队第八名的四川队，成为参加篮球决赛的十二个队中至今唯一保持六战六胜不败纪录的强队；在男子排球赛中，去年甲级排球联赛冠军解放军队却败给了江西队；在足球决赛中，甲级队上海队被乙级队广东队以五比一的比数击败。其他项目中也有这种现象：乒乓球运动健将王传耀败给云南队的丘文岭，甘肃的象棋选手武延福“将”“死”了著名老将侯玉山。这是我国体育运动中的合乎辩证法的大跃进的局面。
    但是，面对这种新手鼓足干劲、“弱队”力争上游的大好局面，有些人的评论却是：出人意料。其中多数人是好心。这种评语反映了他们对我国体育运动事业中的新生力量以惊人速度迎头赶上的一种赞叹。
    但是也有另一些人，这些人的“原意”和“所料”本是新手一直不能赶过老手、“弱队”永远只能甘居为“弱者”，现在大批新生力量以实际行动打破了他们的“原意”和“所料”，于是，就大“出”这些人的“意料”了。
    对于社会主义的体育事业的促进派来说，体育运动出现这种局面，完全是意料之中的事。这是因为，新的不断地胜过旧的、代替旧的，这是事物发展的一种规律。体育运动当然也不能例外。在我们社会主义的体育运动中，由于大力发扬了互相促进、共同提高的风格，更加速了这种发展过程，使得后来居上、青出于蓝成为一种迅速出现、十分普遍的现象。这表明我国年青的运动事业正处在欣欣向荣、蓬勃发展的美好时光里，我国运动员的新生一代像雨后春笋般涌现出来。这就是我国体育事业的大跃进。这是理应大书特书、值得欢欣鼓舞的好事。
    老手可以被新手战胜，而新手慢慢地又会成为老手，因此，为了尽可能比较长期地保持自己的成绩，无论对老手或新手来说，都应该大大提倡胜不骄、败不馁的优良作风。如果胜利者和强者背起了骄傲的包袱，他们就有转化为失败者和弱者的可能。事物可以走向它的反面，这也是辩证法的规律。如果能够随时加以提醒，如果人人都能“意料之中”地警惕骄傲自满，那就不会发生或者尽可能地少发生突然的“意料之外”的转化。
