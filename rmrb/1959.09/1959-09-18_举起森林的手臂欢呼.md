    Raising Forest Arms in Cheers
    Wu Zhongping
    The Greater Khingan Range presses its green temples against the chests of lumberjacks; the lumberjacks press their ears close to the green temples of the Lesser Khingan Range… Quiet, quiet, listen quietly. What sound suddenly silences the mountains? What sound so attracts the hearts of the lumberjacks? Quiet, quiet, listen quietly. What sound is so impassioned and profound? What sound is so majestic and jubilant? Quiet, quiet, listen quietly.
  “Comrade Mao Zedong personally presides over…”, ah, this is the Party's voice, rushing down from the highest peak of Lushan, carrying the echoes of the Three Mountains and Five Peaks. Quiet, quiet, listen quietly—
              ＊The Greater Khingan Range raises forest arms, the lumberjacks raise a forest of arms; together they cheer, cheering the Party's resolution—cheering this order for a great leap forward. Lumberjacks raise the sound of cheering pine waves, the Lesser Khingan Range raises the cheering of pine waves; together they cheer, cheering the Party's resolution—cheering this blueprint of happiness. Tu Li River: We use crowbars to play the guitar for you, so sing! Sing of this heroic forest home. Nuomin River: We push raw logs into your embrace, so dance! Dance out the blooming flowers in our hearts.
                ＊Come, comrades: sing together, dance together, cheer together! Let the hooves of patrolling horses, beat out urgent drumbeats; let the steel saws in our hands, pull out impassioned melodies. Come, comrades: sing together, dance together, cheer together! Let the Party's resolution, every sentence become a steel saw, to be carried by us into the deep mountains and old forests, to unleash its power!
              ＊Let the small trains be fully loaded with timber and the lumberjacks' determination and soaring spirit, to pave newly laid tracks, to support newly opened mine shafts; to build the National Theater in Beijing, to support the small blast furnace groups in Hefei; to make cradles for babies in the communes, to block the torrential rains and mountain floods in waterlogged areas… to support the great leap forward throughout the country year after year! Long live the Great Leap Forward! A thousand years to the Great Leap Forward!

    举起森林的手臂欢呼
    吴中帡大兴安岭把绿鬓贴着伐木者的前胸；伐木者把耳朵贴近小兴安岭的绿鬓……静呵，静呵，静静地听。是什么声音使群山忽然宁静？是什么声音这样吸引伐木者的心？静呵，静呵，静静地听。是什么声音这样激昂、深沉？是什么声音这样雄壮、欢腾？静呵，静呵，静静地听。
  “毛泽东同志亲自主持……”，呵，这是党的声音，从庐山最高峰奔腾而下，卷带着三山五岳的回声。静呵，静呵，静静地听——
              ＊大兴安岭举起森林的手臂，伐木者们举起手臂的森林；一起欢呼，欢呼党的决议——欢呼这大进军的号令。伐木者们响起欢呼的松涛，小兴安岭响起松涛的欢呼；一起欢呼，欢呼党的决议——欢呼这幸福的蓝图。图里河：我们用撬棍为你弹起吉他，你就唱吧！唱这英雄的森林之家。诺敏河：我们把元木推进你的怀抱，你就舞吧！舞出我们怒放的心花。
                ＊来，同志们：一起唱，一起舞，一起欢呼！让巡林的马蹄，敲起急骤的鼓点；让手中的钢锯，拉起激昂的琴弦。来，同志们：一起唱，一起舞，一起欢呼！让党的决议，每一句都变成钢锯，由我们带到深山老林里，去发挥它的威力！
              ＊让小火车满载木材和伐木者的决心与豪情，去垫起新铺的铁轨，去顶起新辟的矿坑；去建造北京的国家剧院，去支援合肥的小高炉群；去制作公社的婴儿摇篮，去挡住涝区的急雨山洪……去支援全国各地年年岁岁大跃进！大跃进万岁！万岁大跃进！
