Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd -- The broad masses of commune members in more than 570 people's communes in rural Fujian, inspired by the resolutions and communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have universally launched a high tide of autumn agricultural production centered on strengthening late-stage field management and processing, determined to present a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country with over-fulfillment of the agricultural leap forward plan, achieving "bumper harvests in non-disaster areas, guaranteed harvests in lightly affected areas, and no production reduction in severely affected areas."

At present, the vast rural areas are full of productive vigor. Of the nearly 20 million mu of autumn crops that have been sown throughout the province, apart from the tens of thousands of mu that have suffered relatively heavy attacks from multiple typhoons, rainstorms, and floods, and whose crop growth has been affected to varying degrees, the other large areas of rice, sweet potatoes, and other crops, under the careful management and processing of the commune members, are generally growing better than in previous years. Single-season late rice and double-season intercropped late rice have all begun to joint, head, and flower. The disaster-stricken crops in the disaster areas, after timely rescue, have also mostly recovered quickly and are growing vigorously.

In the vast non-disaster areas such as northern and western Fujian, the over-production competition movement is in full swing. In Yongding County, the thirteen communes, with the youth as pioneers, under the leadership of the Communist Youth League organizations, have collectively cultivated more than 18,000 mu of high-yield late rice fields. All the high-yield fields are well managed, having been weeded and fertilized three times, with an average application of 90 dan of miscellaneous soil fertilizer and 800 jin of soil-chemical fertilizer and granular fertilizer per mu. In the Nanping area, the communes organized 300,000 people to carry out a blitz of topdressing fertilizer for single-season late rice, and vigorously promote late-stage field management, striving for large-scale high-yield and over-production. Now, 20 to 30 dan of fertilizer have been quickly applied to each mu of land. Of the 4.2 million mu of rice fields in the entire area, more than 3.1 million mu have generally achieved "three-sided brightness" on the sides, ridges, and surface of the fields. Single-season late rice in the entire area has generally begun to head, and harvesting will begin at the end of September and the beginning of October. Guangze County's Chafu Commune organized a high-yield professional team of more than 1,100 people and a lagging seedling elimination professional team to carry out a late-stage processing blitz. The commune's more than 8,000 mu of high-yield fields have generally been given an additional topdressing of fertilizer, and four cultivations and weedings have been carried out; the lagging seedlings have all been processed, fertilized, and promoted to upgrade. The manpower participating in the large-scale accumulation of fertilizer, topdressing, and field management in the Jinjiang area has increased sharply from 300,000 to more than 600,000 in the past month or so. In the most recent month or so, the area has accumulated more than 457 million dan of fertilizer, averaging more than 26 dan per mu of crops.

In the coastal and other disaster-stricken areas, after successively overcoming the attacks of multiple typhoons, rainstorms, tidal waves, and floods, the masses put forward the bold slogan of "If the disaster is one point bigger, the drive will be one point greater; if one tenth of the grain is lost, two tenths of the grain will be recovered," and bravely and tenaciously threw themselves into the struggle to restore production. They received strong support from all sides. The Provincial People's Committee and bank departments have supported the disaster areas with 4.35 million yuan in production relief funds and agricultural and fishery production loans. Various departments and regions have allocated large quantities of wood, bamboo, cement, steel, ironware, sacks, tung oil, gasoline, chemical fertilizers, and other materials to support the disaster areas in rapidly restoring and developing production. Now, after more than 20 days of heroic struggle, the disaster-stricken rice, sweet potato, sugar cane, and other farmland in the Longxi, Jinjiang, Minhou, and Fu'an areas, except for a portion that was more severely affected and has been replanted with autumn sweet potatoes, autumn vegetables, and other late autumn crops, most of the crops have been timely rescued through washing seedlings, supporting seedlings, replanting seedlings, cultivating soil, and topdressing, and have turned green and are growing strongly. Zhenqian and other two communes in Zhenghe County suffered flooding of more than 20,000 mu of crops due to rainstorms and mountain floods, with an estimated loss of more than 1 million jin of grain. In the over-production competition, commune members and cadres vigorously carried out late-stage topdressing and soil cultivation of sweet potatoes, and generally applied an additional topdressing of heading fertilizer to rice, striving to increase production by more than 1 million jin of sweet potatoes and more than 600,000 jin of rice. In addition to recovering the losses from the disaster, it is estimated that they can increase production by tens of thousands of jin of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd -- The people of coastal Fujian have overcome the second tidal wave of the autumn flood season, ensuring the safety of more than 1,800 kilometers of seawalls and more than 3 million mu of crops and the people's lives and property within the dikes. This is another major victory for the people of coastal Fujian since August, having successively overcome the attacks of multiple typhoons, rainstorms, mountain floods, and sea tides.

The three days of September 18, 19, and 20 were the period of the second tidal wave of the autumn flood season in coastal Fujian (i.e., the 18th day of the eighth lunar month). In order to meet this tidal wave, the people's communes in various coastal areas, after defeating the first tidal wave in early September, organized an army of 500,000 people to repair dikes and prevent floods, and universally raised and thickened the dangerous river dikes and seawalls. After their day and night rush repairs, the standardized seawalls in the province rapidly increased from more than 800 kilometers last year to more than 1,200 kilometers. The river dikes and seawalls in southern Fujian, after rush repairs, were higher and stronger than before being impacted by the previous tidal waves and floods.

When the second tidal wave struck on the 18th, there were force five or six winds along the coast, and the tidal water levels in various places reached around the warning line. At this time, the people's communes in various places organized and strengthened flood prevention organizations such as patrol teams, risk prevention teams, and shock teams, and guarded the river and sea dikes day and night. Party committees and commune leaders at all levels fought alongside the commune members at the forefront of the anti-tidal struggle, commanding and participating in the anti-tidal struggle. Fengyang and other nine brigades of Yacheng Commune in the mountainous area of Xiapu County also extracted a large number of laborers to support the coastal people in resisting the tides, protecting the safety of the dikes.

Since late August, coastal and some inland areas of Fujian have successively suffered four attacks of typhoons and rainstorms, tidal waves, and mountain floods. In particular, the strong typhoons of force twelve or more that landed in Haicheng County and Putian County along the coast of Fujian on August 23 and August 30, and the heavy rainstorms and high flood peaks of September 11 and 12, were rare in decades. However, the heroic people of Fujian, inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, under the strong leadership of party committees at all levels and with the support of all parties, with the people's communes and production brigades as combat units, rapidly organized hundreds of thousands to millions of anti-wind and anti-flood troops, and launched a heroic and tenacious struggle against various natural disasters on thousands of kilometers of river and sea dikes and vast fields, finally defeating the extraordinary windstorms and mountain floods time and time again, greatly reducing the disaster losses. After the disaster occurred, the commune members in the disaster areas, holding the ambitious goal of "no production reduction in major disasters, and guaranteed harvests in minor disasters," launched a production upsurge of carrying water, washing seedlings, supporting seedlings, replanting seedlings, topdressing, and replanting, rapidly rescuing a large number of disaster-stricken crops. They carried out a blitz of late-stage processing and fertilization of crops that were lightly affected or not affected by the disaster, striving to produce more and make up for the losses in the disaster-stricken fields. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Provincial People's Committee, and various departments and people in non-disaster areas also provided strong support to the disaster areas in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources. After this series of efforts, the normal production order in the disaster areas was quickly restored. At present, the coastal people are still continuing to work hard to repair the seawalls, meet the greater sea tides and typhoons that may occur in October, and are determined to defend the overall bumper harvest of agriculture.

    非灾区大超产　轻灾区保丰收　重灾区不减产
    福建农村掀起秋季生产高潮
    沿海人民又击退了第二次大潮迅速恢复生产
    新华社福州22日电　福建农村五百七十多个人民公社的广大社员，在党的八届八中全会决议和公报的鼓舞下，普遍以加强后期田间管理、后期加工为中心，掀起了“非灾区大超产、轻灾区保丰收、重灾区不减产”的秋季农业生产大高潮，决心以超额完成农业跃进计划向建国十周年献礼。
    现在，广大农村生产劲头十足。全省已种下的近二千万亩秋季作物，除了几十万亩遭受多次台风、暴雨、洪水的较重的袭击，农作物生长受到不同程度影响以外，其他大面积的稻谷、甘薯等作物，在社员们的精心管理和加工下，普遍比往年长得好，单季晚稻和双季间作晚稻等都已开始拔节、孕穗、抽穗。灾区里的受灾农作物，经过及时抢救，也大都迅速转机成长，欣欣向荣。
    在福建北部、西部等广大非灾区里，超产竞赛运动开展得热火朝天。永定县十三个公社以青年为先锋，在团组织带动下，全体共青团员和青年社员共搞起了一万八千多亩晚稻丰产田。所有丰产田都管理得很好，已经耘草追肥各三次，平均每亩施土杂肥九十担、土化肥和颗粒肥料八百斤。南平专区各公社组织三十万人，为单季晚稻突击追施催穗肥，大搞后期田间管理，力争大面积丰产、超产，现在已迅速在每亩田里追施下二十多担到三十担肥料。四百二十万亩稻田中，有三百一十多万亩已普遍作到田旁、田埂、田面三面光。全区单季晚稻普遍开始孕穗，到9月底10月初就将开镰收割。光泽县茶富公社组织了一千一百多人的丰产专业队和消灭落后苗专业队，突击进行后期加工。全社八千多亩丰产田已普遍多施一次追肥，前后进行了四次中耕除草；落后苗都经过了加工、加肥、促其升级。晋江专区参加大搞积肥、追肥和田间管理的人力，已由不久前的三十万人激增到六十多万人。在最近一个多月里，全区就积肥四亿五千七百多万担，平均每亩农作物达二十六担多。
    在沿海等受灾地区，在接连战胜多次台风、暴雨、大潮、洪水的袭击以后，群众提出“灾害大一分，干劲加一番、损失一成谷，夺回二成粮”的豪迈口号，英勇顽强地投入恢复生产的斗争。他们得到了各方面的大力支援。省人民委员会和银行等部门已支援各灾区生产救灾款和农渔业生产贷款四百三十五万元，各部门和各地调拨了大批木材、毛竹、水泥、钢材、铁器、麻袋、桐油、汽油、化学肥料等各种物资，支援灾区迅速恢复和发展生产。现在，经过二十多天的英勇奋战，龙溪、晋江、闽侯和福安等专区的受灾稻谷、甘薯、甘蔗等农田，除了一部分受灾较重的已经重种秋薯、秋菜等晚秋作物以外，绝大部分农作物都经过洗苗、扶苗、补苗、培土、追肥等及时抢救，转青茁壮。政和县镇前等两个公社，在暴雨、山洪袭击中有二万多亩农作物受淹，大约要损失粮食一百多万斤。社员和干部们在超产竞赛中，大搞甘薯后期追肥、培土，稻谷普遍加施一次催穗肥等，力争多增产甘薯一百多万斤，稻谷六十多万斤，除了夺回受灾损失以外，估计还可以多增产几十万斤粮食。
    新华社福州22日电　福建沿海人民战胜了秋汛第二次大潮，确保了一千八百多公里海堤和堤内三百多万亩农作物以及人民生命财产的安全。这是福建沿海人民，自8月下旬以来，连续战胜多次台风、暴雨、山洪和海潮袭击以后的又一次重大胜利。
    9月18、19、20日三天，是福建沿海秋汛第二次大潮期（即农历8月18大潮）。为了迎击这次大潮，沿海各地人民公社在9月上旬战胜第一次大潮之后，就组织起五十万修堤防汛大军，对险要的江堤海堤普遍加高培厚。经过他们夜以继日的抢修，全省达到标准化的海堤，迅速由去年的八百多公里增加到一千二百多公里。闽南地区经过抢修的江堤海堤比遭受前几次大潮洪水冲击前更高更牢。
    18日第二次大潮袭来时，沿海有五、六级的大风，各地潮水位都达到警戒线上下。这时，各地人民公社都组织和加强了巡逻队、防险队、突击队等防汛组织，日夜守卫在江海堤岸上。各级党委和公社领导干部，同社员们一起战斗在抗潮的最前列，指挥和参加抗潮斗争。霞浦县山区牙城公社凤阳等九个大队，还抽出大批劳力，支援沿海人民抗潮，保卫了堤岸的安全。
    从8月下旬以来，福建沿海和部分内陆地区曾先后遭受四次台风和暴雨、大潮、山洪的袭击，特别是8月23日、8月30日由福建沿海海澄县、莆田县登陆的十二级以上的强台风，9月11、12日的大暴雨和高洪峰，都是几十年来所少见的。但是，英勇的福建人民在党的八届八中全会伟大号召的鼓舞下，在各级党委的坚强领导和各方面支援下，以人民公社和生产大队为战斗单位，迅速组织了数十万到上百万抗风抗洪大军，在几千公里的江堤海堤和广阔原野上同各种自然灾害展开了英勇顽强的搏斗，终于一次又一次地战胜了特大的狂风暴雨和山洪的袭击，大大减轻了灾害损失。灾害发生后，灾区人民公社社员又抱着“大灾不减产、小灾保丰收”的雄心大志，掀起了挑水、洗苗、扶苗、补苗、追肥和重种等生产热潮，迅速地把大批受灾农作物抢救过来。对受灾较轻和没有受灾的农作物突击进行后期加工加肥，力争多超产，弥补受灾田的损失。中共福建省委、省人民委员会和各部门、各非灾区人民也从人力、物力、财力等多方面给予灾区大力支援。经过这一连串的努力，灾区的正常生产秩序很快就得到了恢复。目前，沿海人民仍在继续努力抢修海堤，迎击10月份可能发生的更大的海潮和台风等自然灾害，决心保卫农业全面大丰收。（附图片）
