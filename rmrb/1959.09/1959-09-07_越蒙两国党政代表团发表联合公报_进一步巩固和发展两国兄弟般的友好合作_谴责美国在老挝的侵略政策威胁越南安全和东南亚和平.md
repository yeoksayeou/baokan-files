Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 6th: The joint communiqué signed in Hanoi on September 5th by the Party and Government Delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Party and Government Delegations of the Mongolian People's Republic was released here today.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic is very pleased with the great achievements made by the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in political, economic, and cultural life under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh. The achievements of the Vietnamese people in building socialism are a strong guarantee for the cause of realizing the unification of the motherland.

The meeting was conducted in a very intimate and friendly atmosphere.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Mongolian People's Republic are very pleased to see that the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has made many great achievements in politics, economy, culture, and science and technology, making the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism unprecedentedly strong and consolidated. Today, it already possesses sufficient strength to stop war. The peaceful foreign policies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp are receiving increasingly broad support from peace-loving people around the world.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegations of the two countries warmly welcome the mutual visits to be made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and US President Eisenhower, and believe that such mutual visits are the result of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and efforts, and will help to ease international tensions and safeguard peace.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegations of the two countries are pleased to see that, along with the growth of the socialist camp, the national liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is developing day by day. The Vietnamese and Mongolian peoples, who have suffered deeply from the aggression of imperialist colonialists, deeply sympathize with and fully support the struggle of the people of all nations around the world against imperialism and colonialism to win freedom and independence. The communiqué then stated that the Party and Government Delegations of the two countries believe that the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have put forward many specific initiatives to seek solutions through consultation to promote international issues that have matured, but the Western imperialist aggressive group, headed by US imperialism, stubbornly refuses constructive initiatives and continues to implement their "strength" policy, blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and creating tension to realize their aggressive conspiracies. The communiqué also condemned the US imperialist aggressive group for turning South Korea into its military base and obstructing the unification of Korea, stepping up the establishment of various missile bases in Japan, providing military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and obstructing the People's Republic of China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegations of the two countries welcome and support the demands of peace-loving people around the world for the dissolution of all military aggressive blocs, the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Europe and Asia, the signing of a peace treaty with Germany, and the expulsion of the United States from South Korea.

    The communiqué stated that both sides are concerned about the very serious situation in Laos caused by US imperialism and the government of Phoui Sananikone. The Party and Government Delegations of the two countries firmly condemn the US aggressive policy in Laos, which flagrantly violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos, and conspires to turn Laos into a US military base, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. Both sides believe that the only way to eliminate tension in Laos and defend peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia is for the US government and the Kingdom of Laos government to thoroughly and fully implement the Geneva Agreements on Laos and restore the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

    The communiqué stated that both sides firmly condemn the US imperialist aggressive policy in South Vietnam. The Party and Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic opposes US imperialist interference in Vietnam's internal affairs, violating the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam, and opposes the inhuman crimes committed by the United States and its lackey Ngo Dinh Diem clique against South Vietnamese patriots and former resistance personnel. The Party and Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic demands that US imperialism withdraw from South Vietnam, and demands the unification of Vietnam on the basis of the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam. The Party and Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic declares that the Mongolian people firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle to unify their motherland on the basis of independence and democracy.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly opposes the US imperialist policy of obstructing the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly support the Mongolian People's Republic joining the United Nations. The communiqué stated that the Vietnamese Labor Party Delegation and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Delegation are satisfied that the unity among the communist and workers' parties of all countries is being consolidated and developed day by day, while revisionism and dogmatism are being severely criticized and condemned. Both sides are pleased that the experience of the Soviet Union in building communism and the experience of the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries in building socialism prove the correctness and thoroughness of the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The Party and Government Delegations of the two countries unanimously believe that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great significance not only to the Soviet Union but also to socialist countries and the international workers' movement.

    The communiqué stated that the Party and Government Delegations of the two countries are pleased that the relations between the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party are developing fruitfully on the basis of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism. Both sides announced that this relationship between the two brotherly parties will increasingly develop and consolidate.

    The communiqué stated that both sides are satisfied that the inherent brotherly friendly relations between Vietnam and Mongolia, closely united in the big family of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, are developing and consolidating day by day.

    The Party and Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic announced that in order to contribute to the development of socialist animal husbandry in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Mongolian people will provide the Vietnamese people with 100,000 head of livestock free of charge between 1959 and 1965. The Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcomed this brotherly assistance.

    The communiqué announced that the Party and Government Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic invited the Party and Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to pay a friendly visit to the Mongolian People's Republic at a convenient time. The Party and Government Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam gladly accepted this invitation.

    The communiqué concluded by saying that the delegations of both sides have decided that, for the happiness of their respective nations and for the benefit of socialism and peace, they will resolutely further strengthen and consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries.
