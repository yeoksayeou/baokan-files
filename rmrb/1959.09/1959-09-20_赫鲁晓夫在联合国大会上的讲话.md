Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 19th: TASS reports: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev delivered a speech at the 14th United Nations General Assembly on the 18th.

Khrushchev's speech at this international organization's meeting aroused great interest among those present. Before the meeting, the UN's main halls and lounges were already filled with a very active atmosphere. Many diplomats, journalists, and photographers from various countries gathered here. At 3:00 PM local time, Khrushchev and his entourage arrived at the United Nations Building. They were warmly welcomed at the entrance by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, Soviet Permanent Representative to the UN Sobolev, and other officials.

When Soviet head of government Khrushchev entered the conference hall, the General Assembly representatives stood up and welcomed the distinguished guest with thunderous applause. Accompanied by the President of the session, Béland, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, Khrushchev walked towards the presidium. Khrushchev sat in the seat specially prepared for the distinguished guest.

Session President Béland addressed the meeting on behalf of the representatives of the 14th UN General Assembly, welcoming Khrushchev. Then, Béland invited Khrushchev to deliver his speech. Amidst thunderous applause, Khrushchev walked to the podium. When Khrushchev's speech concluded, the representatives and guests stood up, and the hall erupted in thunderous cheers. The session president thanked Khrushchev, emphasizing that everyone had listened to his speech with great attention.

After the meeting, Khrushchev, accompanied by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, visited the United Nations Building.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 18th (TASS): Full text of Khrushchev's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on September 18th.

Mr. President! Distinguished Representatives!

I am visiting the United States at the invitation of U.S. President Eisenhower and have coincided with the beginning of the work of the United Nations General Assembly. First, allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the representatives of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General for making it possible for me to speak from the lofty platform of the United Nations. I am particularly honored that the Soviet Union will today present extremely important proposals on the most pressing and disturbing issue – disarmament – for discussion by the Assembly.

In history, no international organization has inspired such hopes as the United Nations. Born in a grim era, when the guns of the last battles of World War II had not yet fallen silent, and the ruins of destroyed cities and villages were still smoldering, the United Nations represented the thoughts and aspirations of millions of people who had suffered greatly, making it its primary task to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.

The people of all countries expect the establishment of trust and mutual understanding among nations and the strengthening of universal peace.

Currently, there are more than eighty member states of the United Nations. Many countries that belonged to the camp hostile to the founders of this organization in the last World War have now joined its ranks.

It has been more than fourteen years since this international organization was established. However, the goals pursued at the time of its establishment have still not been achieved. The people of all countries still live frequently in anxiety about the cause of peace and their own future. Indeed, how can one not feel this anxiety when military conflicts break out from time to time in this or that region of the world, and human blood flows? The horrors of World War II are still fresh in our minds, but the clouds of new war dangers have already enveloped the world, sometimes almost on the verge of a storm.

The state of tension in international relations cannot continue indefinitely: either this tension will reach such a boiling point that there is only the path of war, or countries will work together to eliminate this tension in time. The people of all countries expect the United Nations to redouble its efforts to create an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding among nations and to strengthen universal peace.

If the goal pursued by countries is not to divide the present world, but to bring countries closer together, then there will be achievements in international affairs and in resolving disputes. No social and political differences, no ideological and religious differences should prevent the member states of the United Nations from reaching agreement on the main issue—the sacred and absolute observance of the principles of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation. If differences and social distinctions are put first, then all our efforts to defend peace will be doomed to failure. In the twentieth century, one cannot launch a campaign to eliminate heretics with fire and sword like religious fanatics in the Middle Ages, without risking bringing humanity to the brink of the greatest catastrophe in history.

The United Nations itself is the embodiment of the idea of peaceful cooperation among countries with different social and political systems. This is indeed the case; just look at how many representatives of countries with different social systems, how many races and nationalities, and how many different worldviews and cultures there are in this hall! However, when countries take different attitudes toward the assessment of disputes, and when there are differences in views on the causes of the current international tension, one must be prepared: eliminating differences requires tenacious efforts, perseverance, and wise consideration of national interests by the governments of all countries. The time has come to open up a period in which international negotiations, conferences, and meetings of heads of state are held, so that international issues that have matured can be resolved one by one.

In order for countries to coexist peacefully, the "Cold War" must be ended, and war cries should be stopped first.

In order to fully affirm the principle of peaceful coexistence in relations between countries, we believe that the "Cold War" must be ended. The people of all countries cannot allow the abnormal state of the "Cold War" to continue indefinitely, just as they cannot allow the rampant spread of plague and cholera.

What does it mean to eliminate the "Cold War"? What must be done about it?

First of all, war cries must be stopped. It must be acknowledged that some short-sighted national leaders continue to make bellicose speeches. Isn't it time to stop threatening other countries with the use of force?

The "Cold War" is doubly dangerous because it is carried out under conditions of a frantic arms race, which is snowballing and deepening suspicion and distrust between countries.

It should also not be forgotten that the "Cold War" began and developed under circumstances in which the remnants of World War II had not yet been eliminated, a peace treaty with Germany had not yet been concluded, and the occupation regime was maintained in the center of Germany, in Berlin, and in the territory of West Berlin. Eliminating the root of this tension in the heart of Europe will provide the key to normalizing the current international tension because, in this potentially dangerous area, the large armed forces of two hostile blocs are in direct contact. We call on the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to do everything in their power to reach an agreement on effective steps to achieve this goal.

Who can deny that doing everything possible to develop contacts between the people of all countries is of great significance for eliminating the "Cold War" and improving the international atmosphere. We advocate expanding mutual visits between national leaders, as well as representatives of political, business, and opinion circles. We advocate developing international economic, cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation.

I would like to point out that the United Nations Organization would be able to fulfill its lofty role more smoothly if it could clear away the "Cold War" elements that often bind its work.

Restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations will be a major contribution to the normalization of the entire international situation.

Isn't it a product of the "Cold War" that for many years, one of the largest countries in the world—the People's Republic of China—has been deprived of its legitimate rights in the United Nations, an intolerable phenomenon?

It is simply inconceivable that anyone could think that the most important global issues can be resolved permanently and reliably without the participation of the great People's China, which is celebrating its glorious tenth anniversary.

Please allow me to speak frankly here about my views on this issue. As everyone knows, when a person dies, he is always buried. No matter how precious the deceased is, no matter how reluctant people are to part with him, life forces everyone to consider the reality: making a coffin or digging a grave for the deceased, and carrying the deceased out of the place where the living live. It was like this in ancient times, and it is still like this now. Why should the corpse of reactionary China, that is, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, represent China in the United Nations? We believe that the United Nations should have done what the people of all countries do with corpses, that is, carry the corpse away long ago, and let the true representatives of the Chinese people occupy its legitimate position in the United Nations.

Because China is simply not Taiwan. Taiwan is just a small island, a province, that is, a small part of the great country—China. China—this is the People's Republic of China, which has been developing rapidly for ten years, has a solid government recognized by all the Chinese people, and has a legislature elected by all the Chinese people. China—this is a great country, and its capital is Beijing. And Taiwan, as an inseparable part of sovereign China, will sooner or later be merged into the whole of the People's China, that is, the government of the People's Republic of China will sooner or later exercise power on this island. The sooner this is done, the better.

Restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations will not only greatly enhance the prestige and reputation of the United Nations but will also be a major contribution to the normalization of the entire international situation.

May the United Nations find the strength within itself to clear away all the accumulations of the "Cold War" and become a truly all-encompassing international cooperation organization that can effectively serve the interests of world peace.

However, people may raise the question: Eliminating the "Cold War," consolidating peace, and peaceful coexistence among countries are certainly admirable and extremely lofty goals, but can this goal be achieved? Is it realistic? Are we already able to establish relations between countries on a new basis in the contemporary conditions?

I declare very firmly from this podium that the Soviet government believes that achieving the above goals is not only imperative but also entirely feasible. The Soviet Union is deeply convinced that the necessary conditions already exist to drastically improve international relations and to completely eliminate the "Cold War" for the benefit of all mankind.

Let us take a look, even if it is just a brief look, at the major events related to the issue of easing international tension that have occurred in recent months.

The convening of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference in May 1959, in which fully authorized representatives of the two Germanys participated for the first time, was itself a manifestation of a new spirit in international relations—a spirit of realism and mutual understanding. Of course, it cannot yet be considered that the results achieved in Geneva are sufficient to practically resolve the pressing international issues. However, the detailed and frank discussion of the issues on the agenda of the Geneva Conference, as pointed out in the communiqué at the end of the conference, allowed both sides to come closer to each other on a series of issues, which is a good thing. This laid a good foundation for further negotiations, which may make it possible to reach agreements on still unresolved issues.

It is particularly gratifying that some important measures have been taken to develop Soviet-American relations. There is probably no one who still doubts that the development of the entire international situation depends in many ways on what kind of relationship is established between the United States and the Soviet Union—the two most powerful countries in the world. Precisely because of this, the sprouts of new things that have recently appeared in Soviet-American relations have been endorsed by the whole world with the most sincere approval. The ice in Soviet-American relations has undoubtedly begun to move, and we are sincerely happy about this.

Among a series of events that guarantee the improvement of Soviet-American relations, the mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States can be said to be a milestone. I have exchanged and will continue to exchange views with the President of the United States on the issue of Soviet-American relations and on international issues that have matured. We believe that Mr. Eisenhower is willing to promote the elimination of tension in relations between countries.

The President of the United States once said at a press conference that he is willing to conduct realistic negotiations with the Soviet Union on a sensible and mutually assured plan for universal disarmament or disarmament of special types of weapons, to lay a real foundation for resolving the issue of a divided Germany, and to promote the easing of world tension through other means. I sincerely hope that my exchange of views with President Eisenhower will be fruitful.

We all hope that the mutual visits and the upcoming meetings and talks between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union will help pave the way for the complete elimination of the "Cold War," of course, this requires both sides to have the desire to achieve this goal. This is how we view our visit to the United States and President Eisenhower's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union.

Many other facts can also be cited to illustrate the new good phenomena in the international situation.

The signs of warming in relations between countries are certainly not the result of a coincidence of various favorable situations. We believe that the world is indeed entering a new stage in international relations. The difficult years of the "Cold War" cannot but leave traces on anyone. The ordinary people and politicians of various countries have repeatedly considered many issues and learned a lot. The forces actively striving for peace and friendly relations among the people of all countries have become incomparably stronger.

Of course, it would be blind optimism to say that the situation of distrust and suspicion in relations between countries has become a thing of the past, that world peace has been guaranteed, and that countries no longer need to make tenacious efforts. Because, regrettably, there are still many people in many countries who are active and influential in hindering the easing of international tension and sowing the seeds of new conflicts. These people insist on outdated and obsolete things and cling to the legacy of the "Cold War."

However, the course of many events, especially recent events, shows that attempts to hinder the easing of international tension and put sticks in the wheels will only put those who are unwilling to give up such attempts in a difficult situation, because the people of all countries will not support them.

The last few bastions of the colonial system are collapsing; the Soviet Union expresses its sincere sympathy and deep understanding for the people of all countries who defend their freedom and independence and gives them enthusiastic support.

Our era is an era of great human progress. We are not only witnessing the vigorous development of industry, science, and technology, but also the rapid change in the political landscape of vast areas of the world. Formerly backward people are throwing off colonial subordination, and new independent countries are being established in the former colonies and semi-colonies. Please allow me to offer my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the representatives of these countries who are present.

At the same time, it should be acknowledged that not all people who have the right to send representatives to the United Nations have their own representatives here. The Soviet Union, like all freedom-loving people, sincerely hopes that the people of all countries who are still in colonial subordination but are resolutely fighting to free their nations from colonial oppression will achieve success.

The collapse and complete collapse of the last few bastions of the outdated colonial system is one of the most significant factors of our time. Just look at the map of Asia and Africa, and you will see a picture of millions of people liberated from generations of oppression and exploitation by foreigners.

Future generations will give high praise to those who led the people of India and Indonesia, the United Arab Republic and Iraq, Ghana, Guinea, and other countries in their struggle for independence, just as Americans today give high praise to Washington and Jefferson, who once led the American people in their struggle for independence.

I think it is necessary to declare here, from the podium of the United Nations, that the Soviet Union expresses its most sincere sympathy and deepest understanding for the people of all countries on all continents who defend their freedom and national independence. I think that our position is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter, because the foundation of the United Nations Charter is the recognition of the right of the people of all countries to live and develop freely and independently.

If not the United Nations, who else should be the first to extend a helping hand to the liberated people, to care about ensuring that they have the inalienable right to be masters of their own destiny and to build their own lives without external pressure or external aggression? Is it not the duty of the United Nations to do its best to promote the economic upsurge of the new countries that have grown up from the ruins of the colonial system, to help them establish their own national economies as soon as possible? This can only be done by giving these countries extensive economic assistance without attaching any political or other conditions. The Soviet Union's position on the issue of economic assistance that it has already given or intends to give to many countries in the future is precisely this. We believe that this position is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

If an international agreement on disarmament and reduction of military budgets can be signed, the Soviet Union will also be willing to join other countries in providing economic assistance to so-called underdeveloped countries by using some of the funds formed within the Soviet Union and other countries. We have said before that we are willing to assume this obligation, and our government has authorized me to reiterate this point from the podium of the United Nations General Assembly.

We believe that there is another very important source that should be widely used to provide assistance to economically underdeveloped countries. Many of these countries have gained political independence, but they are still subjected to cruel economic exploitation by foreigners. Their oil and other natural resources are plundered and transported abroad cheaply, bringing huge profits to foreign exploiters.

We, like many other people, believe that in terms of economic assistance, those who are not currently participating and have never participated in exploiting former colonial countries cannot be equated with those who continue to ruthlessly extract wealth from underdeveloped countries. It would be fair and reasonable if foreign exploiters were to return even a portion of the wealth they have obtained through exploiting oppressed nations to their original owners, and if these funds, returned in the form of assistance to underdeveloped countries, were used to develop these countries' economies and cultures and to raise the living standards of these countries' people.

The Soviet Union has given and will continue to give genuine and selfless assistance to backward countries. The problem is not on our side!

How absurd are the various artificial obstacles that hinder the active and comprehensive development of international trade in our time! The entire system of trade discrimination should have been buried long ago, and there is no need to hold any funeral.

As you know, the Soviet Union has always advocated the full development of trade relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We are deeply convinced that trade is a good foundation on which peaceful cooperation between countries can be successfully developed and mutual trust between the people of all countries can be strengthened. We believe that such a position is fully in line with the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all member states of the United Nations must develop friendly relations between countries on the basis of respect for the principles of equality and self-determination of the people of all countries.

The issue of disarmament is an issue that the people of all countries, large and small, hope to resolve. Engaging in an arms race only confuses and complicates the resolution of all disputes.

Before all of us are many unresolved international issues. The significance and urgency of all these issues are not the same. Some of these issues involve the mutual relations of individual countries, while others involve the interests of the people of many countries and continents. But there is one issue that the people of all countries, large and small—regardless of their social relations and lifestyles—hope to resolve, and that is the issue of disarmament. Whether the future of mankind will lead to wars that bring catastrophic consequences or achieve the victory of the cause of peace will depend in many ways on whether this issue can be resolved correctly. The people of all countries yearn for peace, and people hope to live a peaceful life, without worrying about their own destiny, and without worrying about losing their loved ones in the fires of a new war.

For generations, the people of all countries have longed to eliminate the tools of destructive war. The most outstanding thinkers, the greatest social activists and politicians, and the parties most closely linked to the working people have all proposed and firmly advocated disarmament. However, not only has there been no disarmament, but for decades, the world has been shaken by the frenzy of arms expansion.

Who can say with a clear conscience that the arms race has helped to solve even the simplest international issue? On the contrary, the arms race only confuses and complicates the resolution of all disputes.

In the entire history of mankind, the arms race has never been as rapid and pregnant with such great danger as it is today, in the era of atoms, electronics, and the conquest of the universe.

Not long ago, rapid-firing automatic weapons, tanks, long-range artillery, and bombs were considered the most terrible and most powerful weapons of killing, but can these weapons be compared with the weapons we have today? Now we have reached such a stage: it is difficult to imagine that there are weapons more powerful than hydrogen weapons, the power of hydrogen weapons is practically unlimited. Even if all the destructive weapons that human society has possessed in the past are added together, their power is only a small fraction of the power possessed by the two or three major countries that currently possess nuclear weapons.

If I say that the explosion of one—please note, only one—large hydrogen bomb will produce enormous destructive power, it does not count as revealing a big secret. Not long ago, I saw a speech by an American atomic physicist, Davison, who pointed out that the energy generated by the explosion of one hydrogen bomb is greater than all the explosive force created by all countries in all wars throughout human history. It seems that he is right. Can we ignore the fact that the destructive power of weapons used for warfare has become so great? Can we put out of our minds the fact that there is now no place on Earth that is beyond the reach of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons?

It is difficult to imagine what consequences a war using these appalling means of destruction and killing will bring to mankind. If this war breaks out, the human sacrifices will not be counted in the millions, but in the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. In this war, there will be no distinction between the front line and the rear, no distinction between soldiers and children. It will turn many large cities and industrial centers into ruins, and it will forever turn into ashes the greatest cultural monuments created by the power of human wisdom over many centuries.

This war will also harm future generations. Its radioactive contamination will continue to ravage mankind for a long time, taking away many lives.

A dangerous situation has now formed in the world. There are various military alliances, and the arms race has not stopped for a minute. So much fuel has been accumulated that just a spark can ignite a big fire. The world now faces such an edge that just an accidental error, such as a malfunction in the controller of an airplane carrying a hydrogen bomb, or a mental breakdown of the pilot flying the airplane, can make war a reality.

In addition, everyone is well aware that the arms race has now become a heavy burden on the people. It causes prices of necessities to rise, real wages to fall, and seriously affects the economies of many countries, hindering international trade. There has never been a situation in history like the present one: so many countries and so many people are involved in war preparations. If, in addition to the military, we add those who are directly or indirectly related to military production and those who are engaged in various military research, then more than 100 million people are divorced from peaceful labor, and they are all the most energetic and capable workers, scientific and technical workers. Such a huge force of manpower, knowledge, inventive talent, and skill is swallowed up by the ever-expanding armaments like falling into a bottomless pit.

The world's military spending now totals about $100 billion a year. It is time to end this irrational practice of spending the people's money and energy on preparing for war and destruction.

The Soviet Union is a staunch and thorough fighter for disarmament.

The Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward specific proposals; now the problem is to eliminate the obstacles on the road to disarmament.

The Soviet government pursues a foreign policy that follows the principles of peaceful coexistence and advocates peace and friendship between the people of all countries. The purpose of our domestic policy is only one, and that is to create a life that meets the beautiful ideals of mankind. Our seven-year plan is permeated with the spirit of loving peace and caring for the welfare and happiness of the people. The purpose of our foreign policy is also only one, and it is unchanged, that is, to prevent war and guarantee peace and to guarantee the security of our country and all countries in the world.

Some people in Western countries once hoped that the material resources of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries would be exhausted due to the "Cold War" and that their economies would be undermined. But their calculations have failed. Although the Soviet Union also bears a certain military burden, it simultaneously guarantees the rapid development of its economy and increasingly fully meets the growing needs of its people. Of course, if the military burden could be eliminated, the material needs of the people would be better met.

The Soviet Union is a staunch and thorough fighter for disarmament. In our country, there are no classes and groups that are interested in war, the arms race, or the aggression of other people's territories. Everyone agrees that in order to achieve the magnificent goals we have put forward in improving the welfare of the Soviet people and completing economic construction plans, we need peace. We, like other peace-loving countries, hope to devote our economy and resources entirely to peaceful purposes, so as to fully meet people's needs for clothing, food, housing, and other welfare. However, under the current conditions of the arms race, if we devote all our strength to peaceful construction, we cannot but endanger the vital interests of our people and the interests of national security.

The people of all countries need peace. At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union put forward specific disarmament proposals at the United Nations. We proposed a complete ban on atomic weapons, a significant reduction in armed forces and armaments, and a sharp reduction in military spending. We advocate withdrawing foreign military bases in other countries and withdrawing the armed forces of various countries from the territories of other countries.

We have proven our desire to resolve the disarmament issue not only with words but also with practical actions. The Soviet Union has repeatedly demonstrated its initiative and taken concrete steps to strive to end the arms race and realize practical measures for disarmament as soon as possible. After the end of the war, our country immediately implemented a large-scale demobilization of the armed forces. The Soviet Union completely eliminated all the military bases it had in other countries after World War II.

I would like to recall that in recent years, the number of Soviet armed forces has been unilaterally reduced by a total of more than 2 million people. The Soviet armed forces stationed in the German Democratic Republic have been greatly reduced, and Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from the Romanian People's Republic. We have greatly reduced military spending.

In 1958, the Soviet Union unilaterally stopped the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, hoping that this noble action could become an example for other countries. Regrettably, these wishes have not been realized. At present, the Soviet government has adopted a resolution that if Western countries do not resume the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet Union will not resume nuclear explosions. Only if Western countries resume nuclear weapons testing will the Soviet Union lift the obligations it has undertaken.

The issue of disarmament has been discussed at the United Nations and other international conferences for more than 14 years. But until now, no practical results have been achieved. What is the reason for this situation? I don't want to dredge up old accounts, analyze the obstacles and differences that have arisen in the disarmament negotiations, and I don't want to blame anyone. The main thing is not here now. We are convinced that the main thing is to eliminate the main obstacles piled up on the road to disarmament and to try to seek new ways to solve this problem.

The Soviet Union is in favor of genuine disarmament with supervision, but opposes supervision without disarmament. The most urgent need now is to eliminate the possibility of launching a war.

The experience of disarmament negotiations clearly shows that the issue of supervision has become one of the main obstacles to reaching an agreement. We have been and are in favor of strict international supervision of the implementation of disarmament agreements after the agreements are reached. But we have always opposed separating the supervision system from disarmament measures and opposed making the supervision mechanism an agency for collecting information when disarmament has not actually been carried out.

We are in favor of genuine disarmament with supervision, but we oppose supervision without disarmament. Opponents of disarmament can easily put forward some supervisory requirements for any measure that are unacceptable to other countries under the universal arms race. It seems that even those countries that put forward supervisory requirements with such far-reaching intentions for this or that consideration, when it comes to realizing these requirements, they themselves will not actually be happy to accept these requirements.

There is another difficulty. When disarmament is only considered partially, when people advocate preserving this or that armament even after disarmament agreements are reached, countries still retain the material possibility of committing aggression. People will always worry that someone may still use the remaining weapons and troops to launch aggression in the future. Recognizing the existence of this possibility brings many difficulties to disarmament negotiations.

Many countries fear that disarmament measures will precisely touch those weapons in which they have the greatest advantage and which they consider particularly necessary for themselves. Under such conditions, under the conditions of the "Cold War" and mutual suspicion, it is very natural that no country can openly disclose its military secrets, the organization of its national defense and military production without harming the interests of its national security, if it is serious and not for propaganda purposes.

I believe that the representatives will agree that we must guide the collective wisdom of all countries and the United Nations to find new ways to solve the disarmament issue.

The task is to find a lever that can be used to prevent mankind from falling into the abyss of war. The only thing needed now is to eliminate the possibility of launching a war. As long as large numbers of land, sea, and air forces as well as nuclear weapons and rocket weapons are maintained, as long as young people who have just begun to live must first receive military training, and as long as the General Staff is formulating plans for future military operations, there will be no guarantee of lasting peace.

After comprehensively studying the current situation, the Soviet government expressed its firm belief that we must find a way out on the road to comprehensive and thorough disarmament. If this attitude is adopted, the possibility of establishing the military superiority of these or those countries will be completely eliminated. But only comprehensive and thorough disarmament can eliminate the various obstacles that arise in discussing partial disarmament issues, and can clear the way to establishing comprehensive supervision that encompasses everything.

The Soviet Union proposes that all countries carry out thorough disarmament within four years and no longer have the means to wage war; at the same time, the solution to the issue of permanently stopping nuclear testing should not be delayed.

What are the suggestions put forward by the Soviet government?

The essence of our proposal is: We hope that all countries will carry out thorough disarmament within four years and no longer have the means to wage war.

This means that the army, navy, and air force will no longer exist, the general staff and the Ministry of Defense will be abolished, and military schools will also be closed. Millions of people will return to the posts of peaceful and constructive labor.

Military bases on foreign territories will be completely removed.

All atomic and hydrogen bombs owned by various countries will be destroyed, the continued manufacture of atomic and hydrogen bombs will be stopped, and the energy of fissile materials will only be used for peaceful economic and scientific purposes.

Military rockets of various ranges will be destroyed, and rocket technology will only be used as a means of transportation and as a tool for conquering space for the happiness of all mankind.

Each country can only retain a very limited number of police (militia) equipped with light weapons, whose duty is only to maintain internal order and protect the personal safety of citizens.

In order to prevent anyone from violating their obligations, we propose the establishment of an international supervisory agency with the participation of all countries. A supervisory system should be established to supervise various disarmament measures, and the establishment and functions of this system should adapt to the various stages of disarmament implementation.

If disarmament is comprehensive and thorough, then supervision after disarmament will also be comprehensive and thorough. There is nothing that countries can hide from each other: no country will have weapons that can be used against another country, and then the inspectors will be able to fully exert their enthusiasm.

Solving the issue of disarmament in this way will guarantee the full security of all countries. It will create good conditions for the peaceful coexistence of all countries. At that time, all international issues will not be resolved by force, but by peaceful means.

We are realistic politicians, and we understand that it will take a certain amount of time to formulate such a broad disarmament plan. However, before such a plan has been formulated, and before the issue has been mutually agreed upon, we should not sit idly by.

The Soviet government believes that we should not delay the solution of such an acute and fully matured issue as permanently stopping the testing of nuclear weapons in order to formulate a plan for comprehensive and thorough disarmament. All the prerequisites are now available to solve this problem. We expect to immediately sign and implement appropriate agreements on stopping nuclear testing.

The danger of a rocket-nuclear war hanging over the heads of the people requires bold and far-sighted decisions to ensure peace.

If a decision is made to realize comprehensive and thorough disarmament in the short term and this decision is put into practice, it will lay a foundation for a new stage in international life. If countries agree to embark on comprehensive and thorough disarmament, they can convincingly demonstrate in action that they have no aggressive intentions and are truly willing to establish relations with other countries on the basis of friendship and cooperation. With the destruction of weapons and the cancellation of armed forces, countries will have no material conditions to implement any policy other than a peaceful policy.

Comprehensive and thorough disarmament will make it possible to use enormous material and financial resources for constructive purposes and for the benefit of the people.

After realizing thorough disarmament, mankind will have such a feeling: as if a desert traveler who is exhausted and facing the danger of starvation and thirst has finally reached an oasis after a long period of wandering.

Comprehensive and thorough disarmament makes it possible to transfer enormous material and financial resources from the manufacture of weapons of death to constructive uses. People's energy can be used to create material and spiritual wealth, so that people's labor and life can be perfected.

Implementing a comprehensive and thorough disarmament plan makes it possible to use a large amount of funds to build schools, hospitals, housing, and roads, and to produce food and industrial products. The funds that are withdrawn make it possible to greatly reduce taxes and lower prices. This will have a good impact on the living standards of residents and will be welcomed by millions of ordinary people. The funds spent by various countries on military needs in just ten years can build more than 150 million fully equipped houses that can accommodate many billions of people.

Comprehensive and thorough disarmament will also create brand new conditions to assist some countries that are currently economically underdeveloped and need assistance from more developed countries. Even if a small portion of the funds withdrawn from the cessation of military spending by major powers is used to help these countries, it will open a brand new era for the economic development of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

At that time, all the artificial obstacles that are currently blocking the development of international trade, such as discriminatory restrictions, embargo lists, etc., will be eliminated. The industries of highly developed countries such as the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and others will also be able to receive large numbers of orders from other countries. The funds freed up from disarmament can create extremely broad possibilities for the employment of residents. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that disarmament will cause a crisis or economic recession in countries in the capitalist world with highly developed industries.

When no country is actually able to launch military operations against other countries, international relations will develop under the banner of trust. Suspicion and fear will disappear, and all countries will be able to truly live in harmony. The door to economic, trade, and cultural cooperation between countries will be opened. The reliable and lasting peace that the people of all countries are striving for will become a true reality for the first time.

The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is deeply convinced that the joint efforts of all countries united under the peaceful principles of the UN Charter can and should achieve these great goals. Therefore, it submits a declaration on comprehensive and thorough disarmament, together with specific proposals on this issue, to the United Nations for discussion.

Of course, if Western countries are still unwilling to carry out comprehensive and thorough disarmament for some reason now, then the Soviet government is willing to reach agreements with other countries on corresponding partial measures for disarmament and strengthening security. The Soviet government believes that the main ones among these measures are:

1. Establish supervision and investigation zones and reduce foreign troops stationed on the territories of corresponding countries in Western Europe;

2. Establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe;

3. Withdraw all foreign troops from the territories of European countries and abolish military bases in other countries' territories;

4. Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conclude a treaty of non-aggression with the member states of the Warsaw Treaty;

5. Sign an agreement on preventing a sudden attack by one country on another.

The Soviet government believes that it is appropriate to review the Soviet proposals on the issue of disarmament on May 10, 1955, which contain specific opinions on taking partial measures in disarmament. The Soviet government is deeply convinced that these proposals are a good foundation for reaching an agreement on this very important issue.

This is not the first time that the Soviet Union has put forward the proposition of comprehensive and thorough disarmament. As early as between World War I and World War II, our government put forward a broad and thorough disarmament plan. At that time, the opponents of disarmament incessantly said that the Soviet Union put forward this proposal because it was an economically and militarily weak country. If this false argument could deceive some people at that time, then now anyone has clearly seen that the argument that the Soviet Union is weak is extremely absurd.

The new proposals of the Soviet government stem from the sole desire to ensure true and lasting peace between the

    赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会上的讲话
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫18日在第十四届联合国大会会议上发表了演说。
    赫鲁晓夫在这个国际组织会议上发表演说一事引起了到会者极大的兴趣。会议前，联合国各大厅和休息室就已经充满着非常活跃的气氛。世界各国的许多外交人员、文字记者和摄影记者都聚集在这里。在当地时间下午三点钟，赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员来到了联合国大厦。他们在大厦门口受到了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德、苏联驻联合国常驻代表索波列夫及其他官方人员的热烈欢迎。
    当苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫走进会议大厅时，大会代表们都站了起来以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎贵宾。赫鲁晓夫在本届会议主席贝朗德、联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德、苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯陪同下走向主席团席位。赫鲁晓夫坐在大会特为贵宾准备的座位上。
    会议执行主席贝朗德代表第十四届联合国大会会议的代表们致词欢迎赫鲁晓夫。接着贝朗德请赫鲁晓夫发表演说。赫鲁晓夫在暴风雨般的掌声中走上讲台。当赫鲁晓夫的演说结束时，代表们和来宾们都起立，大厅里发出了一片暴风雨般的欢呼声。会议执行主席向赫鲁晓夫表示感谢，并强调指出，大家极其注意地听取了他的演说。
    会后，赫鲁晓夫在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的陪同下参观了联合国大厦。
    新华社讯　塔斯社纽约18日电：赫鲁晓夫9月18日在联合国大会上的讲话全文。主席先生！尊敬的代表们！
    我应美国总统艾森豪威尔先生的邀请来美国访问，正好碰到联合国大会开始工作。首先请让我向大会的代表们和秘书长表示衷心的谢意，感谢他们使我有可能在联合国崇高的讲坛上讲话。使我尤其引为荣幸的是，苏联今天将就最迫切的、令人不安的问题——裁军问题提出极其重要的建议，供大会讨论。
    在历史上还没有一个国际组织能够像联合国这样使人们对它寄予如此的愿望。联合国诞生于严峻的时代，那时候，第二次世界大战的最后战役的炮声未息，被破坏了的城市和乡村的废墟还在冒烟，它代表了千千万万饱经忧患的人们的思想和愿望，把使后代摆脱战争灾难作为自己主要的任务。
    各国人民都期望各国之间建立信任和相互谅解，加强普遍和平。
    目前，联合国会员国有八十多个。在上次世界大战中属于敌视这一组织的奠基者的阵营的许多国家，现在也加入了它的队伍。
    这个国际组织已经建立十四年多了。然而，建立这个组织时所致力的目标仍然没有达到。各国人民仍然经常生活在对和平事业和自己的未来的忧虑之中。的确，如果时而在世界的这个地区，时而在那个地区爆发军事冲突，人血横流，怎能不叫人产生这种忧虑呢？第二次世界大战的惨祸记忆犹新，而新战争危险的乌云却已笼罩世界，有时简直是风雨欲来。
    国际关系的紧张状态不能长此以往下去：要么是这种紧张局势达到这样的白热点，以至只有爆发战争这条路，要么是各国共同努力及时消除这种紧张状态。各国人民期待联合国加倍努力建立各国之间的信任和相互谅解的局面，加强普遍和平。
    如果各国所遵循的目标不是分裂现今的世界，而是促使各国接近，那么，在国际事务中，在解决争执问题中是会有成就的。任何社会的和政治的差别，任何意识形态和宗教信仰上的分歧都不应当阻碍联合国会员国就主要的问题——各国神圣地、绝对地遵守和平共处和友好合作的原则——达成协议。如果把分歧和社会差别提到首位，那么，我们在保卫和平方面的一切努力都会注定失败。在二十世纪里，不能像中世纪的宗教狂热病者那样用火和剑展开消灭异教徒的进军，而不冒使人类面临历史上最大浩劫的风险。
    联合国本身就是不同社会和政治制度的各国和平合作的思想的体现。事实上也是如此，请看一看，这个大厅里有多少个不同社会制度的国家的代表，有多少个种族和民族，多么不同的世界观和文化！但是，在各国对争执问题的估价采取不同的态度，在对待当前国际紧张局势的原因的见解有分歧的情况下，必须作好准备：消除分歧需要各国政府作顽强的努力、坚忍和从国家利益出发的英明。这样的时候已经到来：除了联合国为加强和平而作的努力外，还要加上各国政府首脑的努力，加上主张和平和各国安全的广大人民群众的努力。一切都说明，是开辟这样一个时期的时候了，即举行国际谈判、会议和国家领导人的会晤，从而一个一个地解决成熟了的国际问题。
    为了各国能够和平共处，必须结束“冷战”，首先就应该停止战争叫嚣。
    为了在各国关系中把和平共处的原则完全肯定下来，我们认为，必须结束“冷战”。各国人民不能允许“冷战”这个违反常态的状况长此以往，就像他们不能允许鼠疫和霍乱猖獗蔓延一样。
    消除“冷战”是什么意思？对此必须作些什么？
    首先必须停止战争叫嚣。必须承认，有一些无远见的国家领导人继续发表好战的讲话。难道还不是停止对其他国家采取武力威胁的时候吗？
    “冷战”是加倍地危险的，因为它是在疯狂的军备竞赛条件下进行的，军备竞赛像雪球一样越滚越大，加深着国与国之间的怀疑和不信任。
    也不应该忘记，“冷战”是在这样一种情况下开始和发展着的，即：还远没有消除第二次世界大战的残余，还没有缔结对德和约，而且在德国中心，在柏林，在柏林西部的领土上保持着占领制度。消除欧洲中心的这个紧张局势的根源，将提供使目前国际紧张局势正常化的钥匙，因为在这一充满潜在危险的地区，两个敌对集团的庞大武装部队直接接触。我们呼吁美国、英国和法国政府竭尽全力，就达到这一目的的有效步骤达成协议。
    谁能否认，尽一切可能发展各国人民之间的接触，对于消除“冷战”和改善国际气氛具有重大意义。我们主张扩大国家领导人，以及政界、实业界和舆论界代表之间的相互访问，我们主张发展国际经济、文化和科学技术的合作。
    我想要指出，如果联合国组织能够清除往往束缚它的工作的“冷战”分子的话，它会更顺利地完成自己的崇高的作用。
    恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利，将是对整个国际局势正常化的重大贡献。
    多年以来，世界上最大的国家之一——中华人民共和国被剥夺了它在联合国中的合法权利，这种令人不能容忍的现象难道不是“冷战”的产物吗。
    简直不能想像，有人竟认为没有正在庆祝光荣的十周年的伟大的人民中国参加，也可以持久而可靠地解决最重大的世界性问题。
    请允许我在这里完全开诚布公地谈谈对这个问题的下列意见。大家知道，人死了总是要把他埋掉的。不管死者是多么可贵，不管人们是如何对他恋恋不舍，生活迫使所有的人考虑现实情况：给死者做棺材或者掘坟墓，把死者从活人住的地方抬出来。古时候是这样，现在还是这样。为什么在联合国中应该由反动中国的尸体，即蒋介石集团来代表中国呢？我们认为，在联合国中也早就应该像各国人民处理尸体那样做了，也就是早就应该把这具尸体抬走，让中国人民的真正代表来占有它在联合国中的合法地位了。
    因为中国根本不是台湾。台湾只不过是一个小岛，是一个省份，也就是伟大的国家——中国的一小部分。中国——这是中华人民共和国，它以飞快的速度发展已经十年了，它有巩固的、为中国全体人民所承认的政府，有全中国人民选举出来的立法机关。中国——这是个伟大的国家，它的首都是北京。而台湾，作为主权中国的不可分割的一部分，早晚要归并于整个人民中国，也就是说中华人民共和国政府早晚要在这个岛上行使政权。这一点做到得越早越好。
    恢复人民中国在联合国的合法权利，不仅能在很大程度上提高联合国的威信和声望，而且将是对整个国际局势正常化的重大贡献。
    但愿联合国能在本身找到力量，清除“冷战”的所有积垢，成为真正无所不包的国际合作机构，能有成效地为世界和平事业的利益服务。
    但是，人们可能提出这样的问题：消除“冷战”、巩固和平及各国和平共处，这当然是使人向往的极其崇高的目标，但是，这个目标能够达到吗？它是否现实呢？现在，在当代条件下，我们是不是就已经能够把各国之间的关系建立在新的基础上呢？
    我在这个讲坛上非常坚决地声明，苏联政府认为，达到上述的目标不仅是刻不容缓的，并且是完全可以实现的事情。苏联深信，现在已经有必要的条件能够使国际关系急剧好转，能够彻底消除“冷战”以利于全人类。
    让我们来看看，哪怕是走马看花地看看，最近几个月发生的同缓和国际紧张局势问题有关的重大事件。
    1959年5月召开了第一次有两个德国全权代表参加的日内瓦外长会议，这个会议召开本身就是国际关系中一种新的精神——现实的态度和相互谅解的精神的表现。当然，还不能认为日内瓦所取得的结果足以实际地解决刻不容缓的国际问题。但是，详细而坦率地讨论日内瓦会议日程上的问题，正像会议结束时的公报所指出那样，使得双方对一系列问题的看法有所接近，这就是好事。这就为进一步的谈判打下了不坏的基础，而进一步的谈判将可能使仍未解决的问题达成协议。
    特别令人高兴的是：已经采取了发展苏美关系的一些重要措施。未必还会有人怀疑：整个国际局势的发展在很多方面取决于美国和苏联——世界上两个最强大的国家——之间建立起怎样的关系。正因为如此，最近苏美关系中出现的新事物的萌芽得到全世界最真诚的赞同。苏美关系中的冰块无疑地已经动起来了，我们为此感到衷心的高兴。
    在保证改善苏美关系的一系列事件中，苏联和美国政府首脑的互相访问可以说是一个里程碑。我曾经、并将继续就苏美关系问题和已经成熟的国际问题同美国总统交换意见。我们相信，艾森豪威尔先生愿意促使消除国与国关系中的紧张局势。
    美国总统在一次记者招待会上曾经说过，他愿意就明智的、相互保证的普遍裁军或特殊类型武器的裁军计划同苏联进行现实的谈判，为解决分裂的德国问题奠定真正的开端，并通过其他的途径促使世界紧张局势缓和。我谨希望我同艾森豪威尔总统的交换意见将会有所收获。
    我们都希望美国和苏联国家领导人的互相访问以及即将举行的会见和交谈将有助于铺平完全消除“冷战”的康庄大道，当然，这要双方都有达到这一目的的愿望。我们就是这样看待我们到美国的访问和艾森豪威尔总统即将到苏联的访问。
    还可以举出其他许多的事实来说明国际局势中新的好现象。
    国与国关系中转暖的征兆，当然不是各种良好情况巧合的结果。我们认为，世界的确正在进入国际关系的新阶段。“冷战”的艰难岁月对任何人来说都不可能不留下痕迹。各个国家的普通人民和政界人士都反复考虑过很多问题，并学会了很多东西。各处积极争取和平和各国人民间友好关系的力量都无比地壮大起来了。
    当然，如果说，国与国关系中不信任和怀疑的情况已经成为过去，世界和平已经得到保障，各国不再需要作顽强的努力了，那就是盲目的乐观。因为遗憾的是，情况还远不是这样。阻碍缓和国际局势和散布新冲突的种子的人还在很多国家进行活动并且具有影响。这些人坚持陈腐的、过时的东西，死抓住“冷战”的遗产不放。
    但是，许多事件，特别是最近的事件的进程表明，企图阻碍缓和国际紧张局势、把棍子插到车轮里去做法只会使那些不愿意放弃这种企图的人陷入窘境，因为各国人民不会支持他们。
    殖民体系最后几个堡垒正在崩溃；苏联对捍卫本国自由和独立的各国人民怀着真挚同情和深刻了解，并予以热情支持。
    我们的时代是人类大步前进的时代，我们不仅亲眼看到工业、科学和技术蓬勃发展，而且也看到世界广大地区政治面貌迅速改变。从前落后的人民正在摆脱殖民主义的从属地位，在过去的殖民地和半殖民地纷纷建立起新的独立国家。请允许我衷心地热烈祝贺在座的这些国家的代表。
    同时还应该承认，并不是所有有权派代表到联合国来的人民都有自己的代表在这里。苏联同一切爱好自由的人民一样，热烈希望还处在殖民从属地位、但在坚决为争取本民族摆脱殖民主义压迫而斗争的各国人民取得成就。
    过时的殖民体系最后几个堡垒正在崩溃和彻底崩溃，这是当代具有重大意义的因素之一。请看一看亚洲和非洲的地图吧，在你们面前展现出的是一幅千百万人从世世代代受外国人压迫和受外国剥削下解放出来的图景。
    未来的世世代代将对那些领导印度和印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克、加纳、几内亚以及其它一些国家争取独立的人给予崇高的评价，就像美国当代人给曾经领导美国人民争取独立的华盛顿和杰斐逊以崇高评价一样。
    我认为有必要在这里，在联合国的讲坛上声明，苏联对各个大陆上捍卫本国自由和民族独立的各国人民怀着最真挚的同情和最深刻的了解。我想，我们的这个立场完全符合联合国宪章的原则，因为联合国宪章的基础就是承认各国人民有权利自由地、独立地生存和发展。
    如果不是联合国，还有谁应该首先向解放出来的各国人民伸出援助之手，关心保证他们有不可剥夺的权利成为自己命运的主人、在没有外部压力和外部侵犯的情况下建设自己的生活呢？尽力促进从殖民体系的废墟中成长起来的新国家的经济高涨，帮助他们尽快地建立起自己的民族经济，这难道不是联合国的职责吗？只有给这些国家以广泛的经济援助，不附加任何政治条件或其他条件，才能做到这一点。在苏联已经或者今后打算对许多国家给予的经济援助问题上，它的立场正是这样。我们认为，这种立场完全符合联合国宪章的原则。
    如果能签订裁军和削减军事预算的国际协定，苏联还会愿意同其他国家一道参加对所谓不发达国家的经济援助，办法是利用苏联和其他国家内部所形成的资金的某些部分。我们从前也说过愿意承担这种义务，我国政府授权我在联大的讲坛上再一次申述这一点。
    我们认为，还有一个非常重要的来源应当广泛地用来对经济上不发达的国家进行援助。这些国家当中有很多国家的人民都已争取到了政治上的独立，但是，他们仍然受到外国人残酷的经济剥削。它们的石油和其他天然财富被掠夺，被廉价运出国外，给外国剥削者带来巨额利润。
    我们和很多其他国家的人士都认为，在经济援助方面，不能把那些现在没有参加而且从未参加过剥削从前的殖民地国家的人同那些继续无情地从不发达国家榨取财富的人等量齐观。如果使外国剥削者哪怕是把他们靠剥削被压迫民族得来的一部分财富归还原主，使这些通过援助不发达国家的形式而归还的资金用来发展这些国家的经济和文化，用来提高这些国家人民的生活水平，那才是公平合理的。
    苏联过去给了、将来仍然要给予落后国家以真正的、无私的援助。问题不在于我们这方面！
    阻挠国际贸易活跃和全面发展的各种人为障碍在我们这个时代里是多么荒谬的遗毒！整个贸易歧视制度早就应加以埋葬，而且不必举行任何葬礼。
    你们知道，苏联一贯主张在平等和互利的基础上全力发展各国之间的贸易联系。我们深信，贸易是一个很好的基础，在这个基础上可以顺利地发展各国间的和平合作，加强各国人民之间的彼此信任。我们认为，这样的立场完全符合联合国宪章，这个宪章规定，联合国所有成员国必须在尊重各国人民平等和自决原则的基础上发展各国之间的友好关系。
    裁军问题是一切大小国家的人民都希望解决的问题。进行军备竞赛只使一切争执问题的解决混乱和复杂化。
    在我们大家的面前有着许许多多的悬而未决的国际问题。所有这些问题的意义和迫切性不都是一样的。其中一些问题是涉及个别国家相互关系的，另一些问题是涉及许多国家和洲的人民的利益的。但是有一个问题是一切大小国家的人们——不论他们的社会关系和生活方式如何——都希望解决的，这就是裁军问题。人类的前途如何：是走向带来灾难性后果的战争还是取得和平事业的胜利，这将在许多方面取决于这个问题是否能够得到正确解决。各国人民渴望和平，人们希望过安宁的、不为自己的命运担忧的生活，不必担心在新战争的炮火中失去自己的亲人。
    各国人民世世代代憧憬着消除毁灭性战争工具。人类中最杰出的思想家、最伟大的社会活动家和政治家、与劳动人民最密切的政党都提出并坚决主张裁军。但是，不仅没有裁军，数十年来，世界一直在扩军的狂热中动荡。
    谁能昧着良心说，军备竞赛帮助解决过哪怕是一个最简单的国际问题。相反地，军备竞赛只使一切争执问题的解决混乱和复杂化。
    在人类的全部历史中，军备竞赛从来还没有像今天，在原子、电子和征服宇宙的时代里这样迅速进行和孕藏着如此巨大的危险。
    在不久以前，速射自动武器、坦克、远程大炮和炸弹还被认为是最可怕的和最有威力的杀人武器，然而这些武器难道能同现今所有的武器相比吗？如今到了这样一个阶段：很难设想，还有比氢武器威力更大的武器，氢武器的威力实际上是无限的。即使把人类社会过去拥有的一切破坏武器加在一起，那在威力上也只不过等于目前拥有核武器的两三个大国所具有的武器的威力的一小部分。
  假如我说，爆炸一个——请注意，仅仅是一个——大氢弹，就会产生巨大的破坏力，这并不算揭开了什么大秘密。不久以前我看到了一位美国原子物理专家戴维森的一篇讲话，他指出，一个氢弹爆炸后所产生的能量，就比人类有史以来所有国家在各次战争中造成的一切爆破力还要大。看来，他的话是对的。用来进行战争的武器的破坏力已经大到如此程度，这难道可以不加考虑吗？现在地球上已经没有一块地方是核武器和火箭武器力所不及的，这一点难道能置诸脑后吗？
    很难设想，采用这些骇人听闻的破坏和杀伤的手段的战争将给人类带来什么样的后果。如果让这场战争爆发，那么人的牺牲就不是以百万计，而是要以千万以至万万计算了。在这场战争中将不会有前线和后方的差别，不会有士兵和儿童的差别。它会使许多大城市、工业中心变成废墟，使许多世纪来人类智慧的力量创造的极伟大的文化纪念物永远化为灰烬。
    这场战争还会遗害后代。它那放射性感染的遗毒还会久久摧残人类，夺去许多人的生命。
    现在世界上已形成了一种危险局面。存在着各种军事联盟，军备竞赛一分钟也没有停止。已经积累了这样多的燃料，只要一点点火花，就可以酿成一场大灾。世界现在面临这样的边缘，只要偶一差错，譬如一架携带氢弹的飞机的操纵器发生故障，或者正在驾驶飞机的飞行员精神失常，战争就会成为现实。
    除此以外，大家都很清楚，军备竞赛现在已经成为人民的沉重负担。它引起生活必需品价格上涨，实际工资降低，并且严重地影响着许多国家的经济，阻碍着国际贸易。历史上还没有过像现在这样的情形：这么多国家、这么多人卷入了战争准备。如果除了军人以外再加上那些直接或间接同军事生产有联系的以及从事各种军事研究工作的人，那么脱离和平劳动的人就在一亿以上，况且他们都是些精力最充沛、工作能力最强的劳动者，科学技术工作者。这样巨大的一股人力、知识力量、发明才干和技巧就像落入无底洞一样被日益扩充的军备所吞没。
    现在每年各国的军费开支共约一千亿美元。现在是结束消耗人民的资金和精力去准备战争和破坏这种不理智的做法的时候了。
    苏联是争取裁军的坚决而彻底的战士。
    苏联曾一再提出具体建议；现在问题是消除
    裁军道路上的障碍。
    苏联政府奉行遵循和平共处原则的外交政策，主张和平和各国人民友好。我们的国内政策的目的只有一个，这就是创造建立符合人类美好理想的生活。我们的七年计划贯穿着热爱和平和关心人民的福利和幸福的精神。我们对外政策的目的也只有一个，而且是不变的，这就是防止战争和保证和平以及保证本国和世界各国的安全。
    西方国家的某些人士曾经指望，苏联和其他社会主义国家的物力将会由于“冷战”而消耗殆尽，它们的经济将会遭到破坏。但是他们的算盘落空了。虽然苏联也承担一定的军备负担，但是它同时保证自己的经济迅速发展，日益充分地满足我国人民不断增长的需要。当然，如果能够消除军备负担的话，就会更好地满足人民的物质需要。
    苏联是争取裁军的坚决而彻底的战士。在我国没有对战争、对军备竞赛、对侵略别人的领土感到兴趣的阶级和集团。每一个人都同意，为了实现我们在提高苏联人民福利和完成经济建设计划方面所提出的宏伟目标，我们需要和平。我们和其他珍视和平的国家一样，希望把自己的经济和资源完全用于和平目的，以便充裕地满足人们对于衣、食、住和其他福利的需要。但是，在目前的军备竞赛条件下，我们如果把自己的力量全部用于和平建设，就不能不使我国人民的切身利益，国家安全的利益遭到危险。
    各国人民都需要和平。第二次世界大战结束时，苏联在联合国提出了具体的裁军建议。我们建议完全禁止原子武器，大大地裁减武装部队和军备，急剧地削减军费。我们主张撤出在他国境内的外国军事基地，主张各国武装部队撤出他国的领土。
    我们不仅用言论，而且用实际行动证明了自己对解决裁军问题的愿望。苏联不止一次地表现出主动性，并且采取了具体步骤来争取结束军备竞赛和尽快实现裁军的实际措施。战争结束以后我国马上就实行了武装部队的广泛复员。苏联全部撤消了它在第二次世界大战以后在其他国家境内所拥有的军事基地。
    我要追述一下，近年来，苏联武装部队的人数单方面地裁减了一共两百多万人。苏联驻扎在德意志民主共和国的武装部队大大地减少了，苏联军队完全撤出了罗马尼亚人民共和国。我们大大地削减了军费。
    1958年苏联单方面地停止了原子武器和氢武器的试验，希望这个崇高的行动能够成为其他国家的榜样。令人遗憾的是，这些愿望没有实现。目前苏联政府通过决议，如果西方国家不恢复原子武器和氢武器的试验，苏联也不恢复核爆炸。只有在西方国家恢复核武器试验的情况下，苏联才解除它所承担的义务。
    联合国和其他国际会议讨论裁军问题已经有十四年多了。但是直到现在还没有取得任何实际结果。这种情况的原因何在呢？我不想翻旧账，分析裁军谈判过程中产生的阻碍和分歧，更不想对谁提出责难。现在主要的不在这里。我们确信，主要是在于消除裁军道路上堆积起来的主要障碍，设法寻求解决这个问题的新途径。
    苏联赞成真正有监督的裁军，但是反对没有裁军的监督。目前最需要的是消除发动战争的可能性。
    裁军谈判的经验十分清楚地表明，监督问题成了达成协议的主要障碍之一。我们过去和现在都主张在裁军协议达成后，对协议的执行情况要有严格的国际监督。但是我们从来就反对使监督系统同裁军措施脱离开来，反对使监督机构成为在裁军实际上没有进行的情况下搜集情报的机构。
    我们赞成真正的有监督的裁军，但是我们反对没有裁军的监督。裁军的反对者可以轻而易举地对任何一个措施提出一些在普遍军备竞赛的情况下为其他国家所不能接受的监督要求。看来，就连那些出于这种或那种考虑而提出具有如此深远企图的监督要求的国家，当临到要实现这些要求时，它们自己实际上也不会乐意接受这些要求。
    还有另外一个困难。当裁军还只是局部性地加以考虑，当人们主张在裁军协议达成以后还保存这种或那种军备时，各国就仍然保留有进行侵犯的物质可能性。人们会一直耽心，利用剩下的武器和军队将来仍然有人可能举行侵犯。由于意识到这种可能性的存在，这就给裁军谈判带来不少困难。
    很多国家害怕裁军措施会恰恰触及到那些它们拥有最大优势的和他们认为对自己特别需要的各种武器。在这样的条件下，在“冷战”和互相怀疑的情况下，如果是认真地说而不是为了宣传的话，任何一个国家也不能公开自己的军事秘密、国防和军事生产的组织情况而不损害本国安全的利益，这是很自然的。
    我相信，各位代表会同意，必须引导所有的国家和联合国的集体智慧去寻找解决裁军问题的新途径。
    任务在于找到一个能够借以防止人类陷入战争深渊的杠杆。目前需要的只有一点，即消除发动战争的可能性。只要保持着大量的陆海空军以及核武器和火箭武器，只要刚刚开始投入生活的青年人还要首先受军事训练，而总参谋部则在制订今后军事行动的计划，那么，持久和平就没有保障。
    苏联政府全面地研究了当前的局势之后表示坚信，必须在全面的和彻底的裁军道路上，寻找出路。如果采取这种态度，就会完全消除建立这些或那些国家的军事优势的可能性。但是全面和彻底裁军才能消除在讨论局部裁军问题时出现的各种障碍，才能扫清通向建立无所不包的全面监督的道路。
    苏联建议所有国家在四年之内都实行彻底裁军并且不再有进行战争的手段；同时不拖延永远停止核试验问题的解决。
    苏联政府提出的是什么样的建议呢？
    我们建议的实质是：希望所有国家在四年之内都实行彻底裁军并且不再有进行战争的手段。
    这意味着陆军、海军和空军将不再存在，将要取消参谋部和国防部，军事学校也将要关闭。千百万人将要回到和平建设性劳动的岗位上。
    在外国领土上的军事基地将要彻除。
    各国拥有的一切原子弹和氢弹都将要被销毁，将要停止继续制造原子弹和氢弹，可分裂物质的能将只用于和平的经济目的和科学目的上。
    各种射程的军用火箭将要销毁，而只把火箭技术当作交通工具和为全人类的幸福而征服宇宙空间的工具。
    每一个国家只能留有极为有限的配备轻武器的警察（民警）人数，其职责只是维持内部秩序和保护公民的个人安全。
    为了使任何人都不能破坏自己的义务，我们建议成立一个有所有国家参加的国际监督机构。应该建立监督各项裁军措施的监督系统这个系统的建立和职能应该适应实现裁军的各个阶段。
    如果裁军是全面的和彻底的，那么，在裁军之后的监督也将是全面的和彻底的。各国相互之间没有什么可以隐瞒的：没有任何一个国家会拥有能用来对付另一个国家的武器，到那时监察员们将能完全发挥自己的热情。
    这样来解决裁军问题将能保证所有国家的充分安全。它将能为各国的和平共处创造良好的条件。到那时，一切国际问题将不是用武力来解决，而是用和平的方法来解决。
    我们是现实的政治家，我们懂得，制定一个如此广泛的裁军计划需要一定的时间。但是，当这样的计划尚未制定出来以前，当问题尚未互相同意之前，不应当袖手坐待。
    苏联政府认为，不应当为了制定全面和彻底裁军的计划，而延宕像永远停止试验核武器这样尖锐和完全成熟了的问题的解决。现在有一切前提条件来解决这一问题。我们期望立即签订并执行关于停止核试验的适当协议。
    悬在人民头上的火箭—核战争的危险要求采取大胆的、深谋远虑的决定来保障和平。
    如果决定在短期内实现全面的和彻底的裁军，并且把这个决定付诸实现，就会为国际生活中的新阶段奠定一个开端。如果各国同意着手全面的彻底的裁军，就能令人信服地在行动上证明它们没有任何侵略意图，真正愿意在友好和合作的基础上同其他国家建立关系。随着武器的销毁和武装部队的取消，各国除了实行和平政策外，就不会有实行其他政策的任何物质条件了。
    全面而彻底的裁军将使得有可能把巨大的物力和财力用于建设性的用途上，为人民造福。
    实现彻底裁军以后人类就会有这样一种感觉：好像一个精疲力尽和面临着饥渴而死的危险的沙漠旅客，经过长久的漂泊后终于到达了绿洲一样。
    全面而彻底的裁军使得有可能把巨大的物力和财力从制造死亡武器方面转移到建设性的用途上。人们的精力可以用来创造物质财富和精神财富，使人们的劳动和生活尽善尽美。
    实现全面而彻底的裁军计划使得有可能把大量资金用于建设学校、医院、住房和道路，用于生产食品和工业品。抽出来的资金使得有可能大大地减少捐税和降低物价。这会对居民的生活水平产生良好的影响，会受到千千万万黎民百姓的欢迎。仅仅十年来各国用于军事需要的经费，就可以修建一亿五千多万幢设备齐全的房屋，可以容纳许多亿人居住。
    全面而彻底的裁军还会创造出崭新的条件，以援助一些目前在经济上还不发达、而需要比较发达的国家给予援助的国家。即使把由于大国停止军事开支而抽出来的资金的一小部分用来帮助这些国家，也就能为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的经济发展开创一个崭新的纪元。
    那时，今天横在发展国际贸易道路上的一切人为障碍，如歧视性的限制、禁运货单等等都会消除。像美国、英国、法国、西德和其他高度发达的国家的工业也就能从其他国家收到大批订货。利用从裁军方面腾出来的资金就能为居民的就业创造极其广泛的可能性。因此，硬说什么裁军会使工业高度发达的资本主义世界的国家发生危机，或者经济衰退，这是不正确的。
    当没有一个国家在实际上有可能对其他国家发动军事行动时，国际关系就会在信任的标记下得到发展。怀疑和恐惧将会消失，所有国家就都能真正睦邻相处。各国之间实行经济、贸易和文化合作的大门就会敞开。各国人民努力争取的可靠和持久的和平就将第一次成为真正的现实。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府深信，在联合国宪章的和平原则下联合起来的各国的共同努力，能够而且应当达到这些伟大的目标，因此，它把一份关于全面和彻底裁军的宣言，连同对这个问题的具体建议提交联合国讨论。
    当然，如果现在西方国家由于某种原因还不愿意全面和彻底裁军，那末，苏联政府愿意同其他国家就裁军和加强安全的相应的局部措施达成协议。苏联政府认为，这些措施中主要的是：
    一，建立监督和调查区，裁减驻扎在西欧相应国家领土上的外国军队；
    二，在中欧建立无原子武器区；
    三，从欧洲国家领土上撤出一切外国军队，取消在别国领土上的军事基地；
    四，北大西洋公约组织成员国同华沙条约缔约国缔结互不侵犯条约；
    五，签订关于防止一国对另一国突然袭击问题的协定。
    苏联政府认为回顾一下1955年5月10日苏联关于裁军问题的建议是适宜的，这项建议包含着关于在裁军方面采取局部措施的具体意见。苏联政府深信，这些建议是就这个十分重要的问题达成协议的良好基础。
    苏联并非第一次提出全面和彻底裁军的主张。早在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战之间，我国政府就提出了广泛的彻底裁军方案。当时裁军的反对者喋喋不休地说，苏联提出这个建议是因为它在经济上和军事上是一个弱国。如果说当时这个虚伪的论点能够迷惑某些人，那么现在任何人都已经看清楚，说什么苏联软弱的论调真是荒谬已极。
    苏联政府的新建议出于唯一的愿望——确保各国人民之间的真正持久和平。
    我们诚恳地告诉一切国家：与目前在某些地区仍旧流行的“让我们武装起来！”的口号相反，我们提出这样的口号：“让我们彻底裁军！”让我们更好地在这些方面展开竞赛：谁能给本国人民建造更多的住宅、学校、医院，生产更多的粮食、牛奶、肉类、衣服和其他消费品；而不要在生产氢弹和火箭上面较量。这将受到地球上一切人民的欢迎。
    苏联今后仍然是联合国在使人类摆脱军备负担和巩固世界和平方面所做的一切努力的最积极的参加者。
    各位代表先生！
    今天我荣幸地在联合国大会上发表演说，联合国可以而且应该在国际事务中起巨大作用。它的意义就在于其中有着几乎世界上所有国家的代表。它们联合在一起是为了共同讨论成熟了的国际关系问题。如果两个或几个国家之间不能达成协议，联合国就应该帮助这些国家。它的作用在这种情况下就是削平可能导致冲突、导致尖锐化甚至战争的各国关系中的棱角。
    联合国如果能在巩固普遍和平和保障各国人民安全方面起主要作用，就能博得应有的尊敬，它的威望就会日益提高。
    但是，应该坦率地说，令人感到遗憾的是，现在联合国在许多场合下并没有履行它的这种性质的职能。有时，甚至向联合国提问题的不正确方式，也会使各国之间的关系更加紧张。
    为什么会发生这样的事情呢？这是因为并不是联合国的所有参加国都以应有的尊敬来对待人类寄予殷切期望的这个机构。某些国家不但没有经常地保持联合国的威望，使它成为一个最有威望的国际组织（一旦各国政府遇到需要解决一些切身重要的问题时，就常常到联合国来），并且还力图利用联合国来谋求自己的狭隘利益。如果在这个国际组织内部有一些国家奉行着把一些国家的意志强加在另一些国家身上的政策的话，那么，它当然就不可能有效地致力于和平。这种政策将会破坏联合国的基础。如果事情继续沿着这种可以称为宗派性质的方向发展下去，那么，这不会导致国际关系的改善，而是导致恶化。联合国就会由一个代表它的所有会员国利益的机构变成一小批国家的机构，这个机构将执行它们的政策，而不是保障世界和平的政策。在第一阶段这将引起人们对联合国的不尊敬，而以后可能导致它的垮台，就像当日国际联盟的情况一样。
    一个正确行动的国际机构的特点就在于：在这个机构里，一切问题应该通过明智的和耐心的探求来寻得大家都能接受的正确的解决办法，而不是以形式上地计算票数的方法解决。要知道，如果不顾某些国家的意志通过不合理的决定，那么要它们同意履行这种决定是不可想像的。因为这会给它们留下痛苦的回味。请想一想，在联合国历史上有过多少这样的事件！所以联合国只能采取大家都投票赞成并认为足以代表它们的共同意志和共同利益的决定。这样的决定就会得到我们这一代人和将来的历史学家承认为唯一正确的和唯一可能的解决办法。
    当然，目前拥有多数的国家集团可以通过对它们有利的决定。但这将是一种“得不偿失的胜利”。这种“胜利”将给联合国带来损失，使它遭到破坏。
    还应该指出，在联合国里表决各项问题时的多数，是一个可变数，它可能变得不利于那些现在常常指靠表决机器的人。有一句俄罗斯谚语说，“播种什么，收获什么”。由此可见，最理智和最有远见的政策，就是共同谋求互相可以接受的解决办法的政策，而作为互相可以接受的解决办法的出发点是深切关心保证世界和平和不干涉他国的内政。
    在联合国成立安全理事会的时候，协商解决问题的思想是这个理事会活动的基础。在这方面，那些作为安全理事会常任理事国的大国对于维护和平负有特殊的责任。为了避免国际关系的复杂化，曾认为有必要确立安全理事会各大国一致的原则，即否决权。
    有些人反对这种否决权。但是如果没有否决权，就不会有国际组织，它就会瓦解。否决权原则使各大国对要求安全理事会讨论的各项问题必须作出一致的解决办法，以保证有效地维护和平。各大国达成一致的解决办法，比靠武力解决国际问题要好。
    各位代表先生：我坦率地阐明对国际形势的一些看法，以及我们对联合国的任务的理解。我们相信，我们受苏联政府委托所阐述的建议一定能够得到各国大多数人民，以及在座的代表们的赞同。
    我向大会代表们保证，苏联今后仍然是联合国在使人类摆脱军备负担和巩固世界和平方面所做的一切努力的最积极的参加者。
