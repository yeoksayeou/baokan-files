    The Moon and Lunar Flight
    The moon is the celestial body closest to Earth, with an average distance of 384,000 kilometers. Its diameter is approximately 3,473 kilometers, and it revolves around the Earth at a speed of about one kilometer per second. Its area is equivalent to that of Asia, and its volume is approximately one-forty-ninth of the Earth's. You cannot see birds and animals there, nor are there flowers and trees. Spending a quiet day and night on the moon is equivalent to a month on Earth. During the day, the temperature there reaches 135 degrees Celsius, while at night it drops to minus 160 degrees Celsius. Its gravity is only one-sixth of the Earth's gravity. If you send something weighing 60 kilograms on Earth to the moon, it will only weigh 10 kilograms. To launch an artificial lunar satellite on the moon, you only need a rocket with a speed of 1.7 kilometers per second. If a person of medium height standing on Earth can see five kilometers away, he can only see 2.5 kilometers on the moon, because the radius of vision there is half that of the Earth.
    You can also find mountains as high as those on Earth on the moon, and you can see impact craters everywhere, with a total number of more than 33,000. However, the moon is not a completely dead world. In November 1958, Soviet scientist Kozyrev discovered that there were still volcanic eruptions there. Moreover, although there is almost no atmosphere on the moon and there may not be water, it is not yet certain whether there are organisms, even microorganisms such as bacteria.
    The moon's rotation and revolution speeds are the same, so it always faces the Earth with one hemisphere. As for the situation of its other hemisphere, it is still an unsolved mystery.
    At present, scientists from various countries have proposed many different plans to conquer the moon, but generally speaking, they can be divided into the following three stages:
    The first stage: use ground-controlled cosmic rockets for flights into the lunar region. At this time, people will understand the detailed topography of the front and back of the moon, and determine the density and composition of the lunar atmosphere, temperature, and what types of biological organisms exist on the moon, and finally select a landing site for the next stage of radio-controlled cosmic rockets.
    The second stage: make radio-controlled rockets land on the moon. The rocket carries a laboratory with television and measuring instruments. Experts on Earth can conduct detailed research on the moon through them. At this time, people will more accurately determine the possibility of humans residing on the moon, and test physiological protection measures that can protect the human body from harmful effects. People can also use the same method to study the state of experimental organisms transported to the moon.
    The third stage: establish a permanent manned scientific station on the moon. First, the equipment of the scientific station, the equipment for protecting the lives and work of the staff, and the fuel required for the rocket to return to Earth are transported to the location selected in the second stage. The task of installing these devices can be undertaken by a type of tank-laboratory that arrives on the moon. This tank-laboratory is equipped with a special remote control operated by ground radio to complete all the preparation work before the first batch of personnel can be sent to the moon.
    The famous Soviet space flight scientist Hlebchevich once said that there is every reason to expect that the next ten years will be the decade of mankind's conquest of the moon. During this period, the moon will communicate with the Earth.

### 月球和月球飞行

    月球和月球飞行
    月球是离地球最近的一个天体，平均距离是三十八万四千公里。它的直径约为三千四百七十三公里，以每秒约一公里的速度围绕着地球旋转。它的面积相当于亚洲那样大，体积约为地球的四十九分之一。在那里看不到飞禽走兽，也没有花草树木。在月球上渡过一个静静的昼夜相当于地球上的一个月。白天，那里的温度达到摄氏一百三十五度，而夜间则冷到零下一百六十度。它的吸引力只有地球引力的六分之一。如果把地球上六十公斤重的东西送上月球，它就会变成只有十公斤重。要在月球上发射人造月球卫星，只要有速度为每秒一点七公里的火箭就行了。一个中等身材的人站在地球上如果能看五公里那样远，在月球上只能看二点五公里，因为那里的视野半径要比地球小一半。
    在月球上也可找到像地球上那样高的山峰，到处可以看到寰形山，它的总数达三万三千个以上。不过，月球并不是一个完全死寂的世界，1958年11月，苏联科学家科齐列夫发现那里还有火山爆发。而且，虽然月球上几乎没有大气，也未必有水，但是否有生物，哪怕是细菌等微生物，目前还不能确定。
    月球的自转和公转的速度一样，所以它始终以一个半球对着地球，至于它的另一个半球的情况，更是一个未解的谜。
    目前，各国的科学家提出了许多不同征服月球的计划，但是，一般说来可分为以下三个阶段：
    第一阶段：用地面操纵的宇宙火箭作进入月球区域的飞行。这时，人们将了解月球正面和背面的详细地形，并确定月球大气的密度和成分、温度，以及月球上存在有哪些类型的生物有机体，最后为下一阶段的无线电遥控宇宙火箭选择着陆地点。
    第二阶段：使无线电遥控火箭在月球上着陆。火箭带有电视和测量仪器的实验室。地球上的各种专家可以通过它们对月球进行详尽的研究。这时，人们将更精确地确定人类在月球上居留的可能性，以及试验能使人体免受有害影响的生理防护手段。人们还可以用同样方法来研究运上月球的试验生物的状态。
    第三阶段：在月球上建立永久性的有人的科学站。首先是把科学站的设备，把保护工作人员生命和工作用的器材，以及火箭返回地球时所需的燃料运到在第二阶段时所选定的地点去。这些设备的安装任务可以由到达月球的一种坦克——实验室来担任。这个坦克——实验室设有地面无线电操纵的专门遥控器，完成一切准备工作以后，才能把第一批工作人员送到月球。
    著名的苏联宇宙飞行科学家赫列勃切维奇曾说，有一切理由可以期望，今后的十年将是人类征服月球的十年。在这个时期中，月球将和地球互相沟通起来。
