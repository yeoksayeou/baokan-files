Hail the Entry of Baogang's Construction into a New Stage
Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
First Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The outflow of iron from Baogang's No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of the original national plan is a victory of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, a victory of the Great Leap Forward in the whole country and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a victory of the Party's policy on nationalities and the great unity of all nationalities, and a victory of engaging in socialist construction on a large scale and carrying out mass movements.

The construction of such a large blast furnace on the Inner Mongolia grassland is inseparable from the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and it is also inseparable from the sincere help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts. We sincerely thank the strong support from all parts of the country, all factories and mines, and all fraternal ethnic groups, and thank the sincere friendship of the Soviet Union and Soviet experts.

Baogang is one of the three major iron and steel industrial bases under construction in our country. Its early iron production indicates that a new force has been added to our country's iron and steel front. The deployment of this new force will not only directly improve the level of industrial production in North China and the level of industrial production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, fundamentally transforming and equipping agriculture and animal husbandry; but also provide a strong guarantee for the continued Great Leap Forward of our country's iron and steel industry.

The production of iron from Baogang's No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of schedule, coupled with the fact that the First Machine Factory and the Second Machine Factory have largely been put into production, marks that the construction of the Baotou industrial base centered on Baogang has entered a new stage, leaping from the period of basic construction to the stage of simultaneous basic construction and production. Because basic construction and production are advancing simultaneously, this has laid the foundation for accelerating the construction of the Baotou industrial base centered on Baogang. In the future, in addition to relying on continued support from various parts of the country, we can strive for partial on-the-spot solutions in terms of production raw materials, building materials, equipment manufacturing, and daily-use industrial products, and some can even strive for complete on-the-spot solutions. This is an extremely favorable situation for accelerating Baogang's construction, accelerating the construction of the Baotou iron and steel industrial base, and striving for a continued Great Leap Forward. Our task is to seize the favorable situation, continue to carry out mass movements centered on the construction of Baogang, cultivate technical forces, strengthen collaboration and cooperation, and promote the leap-forward development of the Baotou industrial base construction.

Over the past year or so, hundreds of factories in more than 20 provinces and cities across the country and fraternal iron and steel companies have given strong support to Baogang; the national railway transportation departments have given priority to the materials and equipment urgently needed by Baogang, shipping them out as express mail. A certain automobile battalion of the Chinese People's Liberation Army fought alongside Baogang workers for nearly a year and a half in order to support Baogang. The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have made great efforts in the allocation of labor, the supply of grain and non-staple food, the supply of building materials, and equipment manufacturing. All of these have greatly promoted the early iron production of Baogang.

In order to accelerate Baogang's construction, it is necessary to strengthen collaboration and cooperation. First of all, focusing on the progress of Baogang's basic construction and production needs, for equipment supporting facilities, transportation, electricity, coking coal, urban construction, etc., the construction progress should be planned and built according to the necessary proportions, and the long-term plan and the annual plan should be closely combined, so as to carry out construction separately, sequentially, and in a prepared manner. Secondly, continue to strengthen the cooperation between Baogang and the machinery factory. Formulate cooperation plans on equipment manufacturing, technology, materials, transportation, construction and production experience, strengthen leadership, and organize implementation.

In order to accelerate Baogang's construction, it is necessary to accelerate the training of technical forces. Now there is a construction army of more than 200,000 people in Baotou City, which is a hundred times more than in the early days of liberation in 1949. With the development of base construction, great achievements have also been made in the work of cultivating talents. However, compared with the needs of production and construction, it is still not enough. For example, in the machinery industry, the number of equipment maintenance and repair workers is not commensurate with the number of direct production workers, installation and civil engineering are not coordinated in basic construction, and leading backbone personnel and technical cadres are still very lacking. For this reason, in addition to relying on advanced factories and mines and advanced regions such as Angang to cultivate and mobilize the necessary construction, installation, and production teams, we must also conduct technical education systematically and in a planned manner while constructing, trial-producing, and producing, summarize production and construction experience in a timely manner, and continue to vigorously cultivate Mongolian and other ethnic minority workers in a planned and prepared manner; conscientiously learn from Soviet advanced experience, continue to build a technical team that is both red and expert, accelerate the construction of new factories, learn to master new machines, and learn to manufacture new products, so that all construction sites and factories, mines, and mine shafts that have been put into production become schools for cultivating talents.

The Great Leap Forward in steelmaking in 1958 provided a very vivid lesson in socialist industrialization to the builders of the Baotou industrial base. The production of iron from Baogang's No. 1 Blast Furnace one year ahead of schedule will cultivate more qualified production workers for the continuous construction and production of large blast furnaces in the future. Grasping production while grasping life will better boost enthusiasm, mobilize the masses, increase labor productivity, and speed up the construction progress. Although Baotou City has made great achievements in grasping life, the growth of non-staple food production cannot keep up with the needs of the population increase. Therefore, we must continue to mobilize the masses to vigorously engage in non-staple food production and build non-staple food bases, so that workers can live well and produce even better.

Baogang has produced iron one year ahead of schedule, which is a great happy event for the people of Inner Mongolia and a great happy event for the people of the whole country. We celebrate the birth of Baogang's No. 1 Blast Furnace and make a strong contribution to this year's steel task. We must continue to carry out mass movements centered on the construction of Baogang, strengthen collaboration, accelerate the training of technical teams, achieve well-trained troops and sufficient supplies, and strive to complete the Baogang construction system at the fastest speed, and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    欢呼包钢建设进入新阶段
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记
    中共包头市委员会第一书记   苏谦益
    包钢一号高炉比国家原定计划提前一年流出了铁水，这是党中央和毛主席英明领导的胜利，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，这是全国和内蒙古自治区大跃进的胜利，这是党的民族政策和各民族大团结的胜利，这是大搞社会主义建设大搞群众运动的胜利。
    在内蒙古草原上建设起这样大型的高炉是与全国各族人民的大力支援分不开的，也是与苏联政府和苏联专家的真诚帮助分不开的。我们衷心地感谢全国各地、各厂矿、各兄弟民族的大力支援，感谢苏联和苏联专家的真挚的友谊。
    包钢是我国在当前建设的三大钢铁工业基地之一，它的提前出铁，表明了我国钢铁战线上又增添了一支新的生力军。这支生力军上阵，不仅直接提高了华北地区的工业生产水平，提高内蒙古自治区的工业水平，从根本上改造与装备农牧业；而且对于我国钢铁工业继续大跃进提供了有力的保证。
    包钢一号高炉提前一年出铁，再加上第一机械厂、第二机械厂大部投入生产，这就标志着以包钢为中心的包头工业基地的建设进入一个新的阶段，由基本建设时期跃进到基本建设和生产并进的阶段。由于基本建设和生产同时并进，这就打下了加快以包钢为中心的包头工业基地建设的基础。今后除了依靠国内各地继续支援以外，在生产原料、建筑材料、设备制造以及日用工业品等方面可以争取部分的就地解决，有的还可以争取完全就地解决。这是加速包钢建设，加速包头钢铁工业基地建设，力争继续大跃进极为有利的形势。我们的任务是：抓住有利形势，继续开展以建设包钢为中心的群众运动。培养技术力量，加强协作配合，促进包头工业基地建设事业飞跃发展。
    一年多来，全国二十多个省市的数百个工厂和各兄弟钢铁公司都给包钢以有力的支援；全国铁路运输部门对包钢急需的材料设备，都优先以快件运出。中国人民解放军某部汽车营，为了支援包钢，和包钢职工一起奋战了将近一年半的时间。内蒙古自治区各族人民在劳动力调配、粮食、副食品的供应、建筑材料的供应以及设备制造等方面，尽了很大的努力。所有这些，对包钢提前出铁起了很大的促进作用。
    为了加速包钢的建设，必须加强协作配合。首先，围绕包钢基本建设进度和生产的需要，对于设备配套、交通运输、电力、炼焦用煤、城市建设等按照必要的比例，统一规划建设进度，把长期规划和年度的计划，紧密地结合起来，以便分别先后有顺序地、有准备地进行建设。其次，继续加强包钢和机械厂的协作。从设备制造上、技术上、材料上、交通运输上、建设和生产经验上，制定协作计划，加强领导，组织实现。
    为了加快包钢的建设，必须加快技术力量的培养。现在包头市已有一支二十多万人的建设大军，比1949年解放初期增加一百倍。随着基地建设的发展，培养人才的工作也取得很大成绩。但是这和生产建设的需要比较起来，还是不够的。如在机械工业中设备维护和检修工人与直接生产的工人不相适应，在基本建设中安装和土建不适应，领导骨干和技术干部还很缺乏。为此，我们除了依靠鞍钢等先进厂矿和先进地区培养和调动必要的建筑安装和生产队伍以外，就是要在边建设、边试制、边生产的情况下，有计划地系统地进行技术教育，及时总结生产建设经验，有计划、有准备地继续大力培养蒙族职工和其他少数民族职工；认真学习苏联先进经验，继续建立一支又红又专的技术队伍，加快建设新工厂，学会掌握新机器，学会制造新产品。使一切施工现场和已经投入生产的工厂、矿山、矿井成为培养人才的学校。
    1958年的大炼钢铁运动，对包头工业基地的建设者是上了一极其生动的社会主义工业化的一课，包钢一号高炉提前一年出铁，将会给今后大高炉的连续建设、生产培养出更多的合格的生产工人。抓生产的同时要抓生活，这就会更好的鼓舞干劲，发动群众，提高劳动生产率，加快建设进度。包头市在抓生活方面虽有很大成绩，但是副食品生产的增长还赶不上人口增加的需要。因此，我们要继续发动群众，大搞副食品生产，建设副食品基地，让工人们生活得好，生产得更好。
    包钢提前一年出铁了，这是内蒙古人民的大喜事，也是全国人民的大喜事。我们欢庆包钢一号高炉诞生，为今年钢铁任务作出有力的贡献。我们要继续开展以建设包钢为中心的群众运动，加强协作，加快培养技术队伍，做到兵精粮足，人强马壮，争取用最快的速度完成包钢建设体系，为祖国社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
