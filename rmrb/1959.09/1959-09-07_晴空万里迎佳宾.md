    Clear Skies Welcome Distinguished Guests
    By Our Correspondent Hu Benying
    On August 30th, the sky, which had been overcast and rainy for days, suddenly became cloudless, gentle sunlight sprinkled the earth, and the air felt particularly fresh and cool. On such a rare fine day, a silver eagle crossed thousands of mountains and rivers from the Mongolian grasslands, carrying the distinguished guests of the Mongolian Party and Government Delegation, dear friends of the Vietnamese people. This made the hospitable Vietnamese people particularly excited. People congratulated each other, saying: "The sun is also welcoming friends."
    In recent days, wherever the Mongolian guests have gone, the Vietnamese people have celebrated as if it were a festival, dressing in bright and colorful national costumes, holding fragrant flowers, and thronging the streets and squares to enthusiastically cheer and greet the guests. In cities, factories, mines, and even along the highways, colorful flags were hung everywhere, and banners made of evergreen branches were inscribed with slogans in large characters: "Welcome the Mongolian Party and Government Delegation," "Long Live Vietnamese-Mongolian Friendship." Vietnamese workers and agricultural cooperative members, who were busily engaged in production labor, tried to find time to participate in welcoming the guests. These vivid scenes demonstrate the deep friendship that exists between the people of Vietnam and Mongolia.
    People remember that when President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, visited the Mongolian People's Republic in July 1955, Chairman Tsedenbal praised President Ho's visit, saying that it would "write another glorious page in the history of the close friendship between the Mongolian and Vietnamese peoples." Today, with the increasing strengthening of close cooperation within the socialist family, the friendship between the Vietnamese and Mongolian people has further developed.
    September 5th was an unforgettable evening. At the welcoming rally held by people from all walks of life in Hanoi, a moving scene, like a warm current, warmed people's hearts. Chairman Tsedenbal presented a Mongolian national musical instrument, the horsehead fiddle, to the Vietnamese people, and said excitedly: "Let this instrument play the song of friendship and socialism between the Mongolian and Vietnamese people." After speaking, he warmly embraced Prime Minister Pham Van Dong. At this moment, cheers and applause intertwined into an ocean of joy in the hall. This was an embrace between the Vietnamese and Mongolian people. This scene is the best song praising the friendship between Vietnam and Mongolia. People firmly believe that the melody of this song will become more and more beautiful, and the tone will become more and more sonorous.
    On September 3rd, Chairman Tsedenbal traveled more than 200 kilometers east from Hanoi by car, crossed turbulent rivers, passed through narrow valleys, and climbed to the summit of the famous Cam Pha open-pit mine in Vietnam's coal mining area. Facing more than 1,000 miners who enthusiastically welcomed him, he raised his arms and shouted in Vietnamese: "Long live Vietnamese reunification!" His loud voice reverberated through the valley.
    This voice is the voice of the Mongolian people's fraternal support for the Vietnamese people.
    A Vietnamese friend accompanying me told me that the Vietnamese people had received warm support from the Mongolian people during those difficult years. After the restoration of peace, just as the land of Vietnam was scarred and full of difficulties, the Mongolian people immediately sent a delegation, bringing a large number of cattle, sheep, meat, and butter to support the Vietnamese people. Now, Chairman Tsedenbal has come to Vietnam again to express the Mongolian people's enthusiastic support for the Vietnamese people's struggle to regain national reunification. The Mongolian people are even more concerned about the reunification of the Vietnamese people's motherland.
    The Vietnamese people are also proud of the achievements of the Mongolian people, and sympathize with and support the struggles of the Mongolian people. During these days of the Mongolian guests' visit to Vietnam, whether walking on the road or attending a gathering, one would feel the strongest voice echoing in one's ears: "Support the Mongolian People's Republic's entry into the United Nations!" Even an ordinary Vietnamese worker or farmer knows that due to the manipulation of US imperialism, a fraternal country that has been established for more than 30 years and has achieved great achievements cannot join the United Nations, and they feel extremely angry about this.
    In the socialist family, the mutual support and friendly solidarity between the Vietnamese and Mongolian people will surely generate tremendous strength, and this strength is also the force that makes our socialist camp more consolidated. (Attached picture)

    晴空万里迎佳宾
    本报记者　胡本英
    8月30日，连日阴雨的天空，突然变得万里无云，柔和的阳光洒满大地，空气也显得格外清新、凉爽。就在这样一个难得的好天气里，一架银鹰，从蒙古草原越过千山万水，载来了越南人民亲密的朋友——蒙古党政代表团的贵宾们。这使好客的越南人民感到特别兴奋。人们互相祝贺地说：“阳光也在欢迎朋友。”
    这些天来，凡是蒙古贵宾们所到之处，越南人民都像过节一样，穿起鲜艳多彩的民族服装，手捧芬芳的鲜花，拥向街头、广场，向贵宾们热情地欢呼致意。在城市、工厂、矿山以至公路两旁，到处挂满了五花十色的彩旗，一座座用常绿树枝扎成的牌楼横额上，写着大字标语：“欢迎蒙古党政代表团”、“越蒙友谊万岁”。在紧张地进行着生产劳动的越南工人和农业合作社的社员，都要设法抽空去参加欢迎贵宾的大会。这些生动的情景，表明着越蒙两国人民之间存在着多么深厚的友情。
    人们记得，1955年7月，越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席访问蒙古人民共和国的时候，泽登巴尔主席曾经称颂胡主席的访问，将在“蒙越两国人民亲密的友谊历史上，再写下金碧辉煌的一页”。如今，随着社会主义大家庭紧密合作的日益加强，越蒙两国人民的友谊又进一步发展了。
    9月5日晚上，这是一个难忘的夜晚。在河内各界人民举行的欢迎大会上，一个动人的场面，像一股暖流似的，温暖着人们的心。泽登巴尔主席把一支蒙古民族乐器马头琴赠送给越南人民，并且激动地说：“让这支琴奏出蒙越两国人民友谊和社会主义之歌。”说完，同范文同总理热烈地拥抱。这时，会场上欢呼声、鼓掌声交织成欢乐的海洋。这是越蒙两国人民的拥抱。这个场面就是一支最好的赞颂越蒙两国友谊的歌曲。人们深信，这支歌曲的旋律将越来越美妙，音调将越来越高亢。
    9月3日，泽登巴尔主席从河内乘车东行二百多公里，跨过湍急的河流，穿过窄狭的山谷，登上越南著名的煤矿区锦普露天矿场的顶峰，面对着一千多名热情欢迎他的矿工们，用越南语振臂高呼：“越南统一万岁！”他那响亮的声音，震荡着山谷。
    这声音是蒙古人民对越南人民兄弟般的支援的声音。
    同行的一位越南朋友告诉我，越南人民在那些苦难的年代里，就曾经得到蒙古人民的热情的支援。和平恢复后，正当越南土地上满目疮痍、困难重重的时候，蒙古人民又立即派出一个代表团，带来了大批的牛、羊、肉、奶油，来支援越南人民。现在，泽登巴尔主席又到越南来访问，表达了蒙古人民对越南人民争取恢复祖国统一斗争的热情支持。蒙古人民更加关心越南人民的祖国统一。
    越南人民对蒙古人民的成就也莫不感到骄傲，对蒙古人民的斗争也莫不寄予同情和支持。在蒙古贵宾们访问越南的这些日子里，无论走在马路上，或参加一个集会，都会感到一个最强烈的声音在你耳边回响：“支持蒙古人民共和国加入联合国！”甚至一个普通的越南工人、农民，他也知道由于美帝国主义的操纵，一个建国三十多年、并取得巨大成就的兄弟国家不能加入联合国，他们对此感到无比的愤怒。
    在社会主义大家庭中，越蒙两国人民的互相支援、友好团结，必将产生巨大的力量，这力量也就是使我们的社会主义阵营更加巩固的力量。（附图片）
