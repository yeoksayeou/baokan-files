Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th -- The slogan "Oppose Rightist tendencies, exert all-out efforts, and strive to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year" has mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of millions of workers in Jiangsu Province. The workers of the province beat the drums of war and threw themselves into a magnificent upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy.

Since August, various forms and content of production increase and economy practice competitions – inter-factory competitions, same-trade competitions, counterpart competitions, opponent competitions, pace-setter competitions, etc. – have been vigorously launched simultaneously in various factories, mines, workshops, sections, groups, and among workers. Workers in the twenty-eight foundries and foundry workshops in the Nanjing foundry industry launched a same-trade competition, which reduced the average scrap rate of castings from 20% to 13%. Factories and workshops vigorously carried out technical innovations and solved key problems that had not been solved for a long time. The eighty-eight innovation achievements in the casting workshop of the Jiangsu Machine Factory, such as the experience of not using ferrosilicon, using hot blast furnaces, and using white cast iron to melt gray cast iron, have set an example for the city's foundry industry to overcome the difficulty of insufficient material supply.

The most intense competition in various factories and mines is the opponent competition. In the opponent competition in the steel casting workshop of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Changzhou, new records appear every day. Guo Wencheng's team first created a new record of smelting seven furnaces of high-quality steel in six hours, and then Jin Kejiang's team created a record of smelting seven furnaces of high-quality steel in five and a half hours; however, soon, Guo Wencheng's team surpassed them again at a speed of five hours. This workshop created more than one hundred new records in August, and the daily output of steel jumped from more than fifty tons to one hundred tons. In the Xuzhou Coal Mine, almost every miner was involved in the torrent of opponent competition to compete for the upper reaches and catch up with the advanced; 99% of the groups in the Xiaqiao Mine and Hanqiao Mine participated in the opponent competition.

In the fiery wave of competition, the red flag is always in the lead, and the pace-setters take the lead. Lu Jinrong, a worker in the sixth workshop of Suzhou Dongwu Distillery, has always had a higher wine yield than others. In the first half of the year, he produced 577 catties more wine than others, and the most in a month was more than 55 catties. In the competition to increase wine yield, the factory took Lu Jinrong as a pace-setter, mobilized workers to observe his operation and promote his experience. As a result, the wine yield of many workers reached more than 50 catties. The pace-setter Lu Jinrong continued to improve his operating methods, and the wine yield increased to 60.03 catties. After the workers continued to catch up, six stoves have now broken through the 60-cattie mark and caught up with Lu Jinrong; the other seventeen stoves have also followed suit, and the average wine yield of the entire factory has increased from 44.9 catties to 52.17 catties.

"Competition is between opponents, mutual assistance is like brothers", "Experience is passed on to opponents, and they soar to the peak together". This communist spirit of helping each other and improving together has added more dazzling brilliance to the competition movement in various factories and mines. After the Lingyanshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Taizhou Iron and Steel Plant in Yangzhou Prefecture launched a competition, the common wish of the workers of the two plants was to surpass each other and help each other. The No. 1 furnace of the Taizhou plant lacked oxygen, and the workers of the Lingyanshan plant divided half of their only six bottles of oxygen and sent them to Taizhou by special car. When the small jacket of the No. 1 furnace of the Lingyanshan plant was burned out, the Taizhou plant borrowed their own spare parts for them to use first. The cadres of the two plants are also as close as brothers, and agreed to call each other once a day to exchange experiences. Since August, the output and quality of the two plants have soared, becoming two red flags in the entire prefecture. What is even more touching is the story of He Dasheng's group in the fourth excavation area of ​​Xuzhou Xiaqiao Mine helping the brother group surpass themselves three times. This good story spread to every mine in the Xuzhou area. He Dasheng's group was the first to lead the workers in this group to innovate the operating technology, and the shift progress increased from 1.7 meters to 3 meters; after that, he told his experience to the Sha Jincheng group, allowing the Sha Jincheng group to surpass himself. He Dasheng continued to improve, and the shift progress increased to 4 meters. In order to make progress together, he once again taught his experience to the Sha Jincheng group, allowing him to surpass himself for the second time. He Dasheng launched the workers for the third time to create favorable conditions for the Sha Jincheng group, helped them create the latest record of 5096 meters, and then let the Sha Jincheng group walk in the front. Now, all work areas in each mine are learning from He Dasheng's advanced thinking and advanced experience, and strive to create greater leap forward achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th -- A greater production upsurge is vigorously unfolding on the capital's industrial front.

Statistics from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics show that industrial production in August was one of the months with the largest increase this year. The monthly production plan was overfulfilled by 15.2%, and the total industrial output value increased by 19.2% compared with July.

During this month, the output of steel and steel products rose sharply. The output of steel increased by 12.7% compared with July, the highest output this year. The output of steel products was equivalent to about 70% of the output in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 16.1% compared with June, the highest output this year. The output of pig iron also increased by 2.7% compared with July. Major products such as cement, electricity, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, and wool textiles all overfulfilled the monthly plan. The total output value of the ten factories under the Municipal Light Industry Bureau increased by 37.4% in August compared with July. The output of many daily-use industrial products has increased rapidly, such as soap, which increased by 83% compared with July, and sewing machines, which doubled compared with July.

This great production upsurge has a deep ideological and material foundation. Last year, the workers on the Beijing industrial front, who more than doubled the city's total industrial output value, have continued to hold high the banner of the Party's general line for socialist construction this year, winning successive battles and victories. While the total industrial output value has increased significantly, they have generally improved enterprise management, improved product quality, launched large-scale technical training, and tapped the potential of materials, and strengthened the maintenance of machinery and equipment. This series of tasks have created favorable conditions for continuing the great leap forward. After mid-July, the city's industrial front launched another ideological struggle to encourage hard work and oppose Rightist tendencies. The broad masses of workers and staff unfolded a great debate around continuing the great leap forward. The Rightist slackening emotions of a few cadres were seriously criticized, the masses' will to leap forward became more and more vigorous, and production also increased step by step. The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were a combat mobilization order, which more powerfully encouraged the masses. When the communique and resolutions were conveyed to all workers and staff, a new production upsurge was immediately set off. Enterprises held mobilization rallies, put forward leap forward plans, and new production records and new achievements emerged like a fountain.

The first feature of this new production upsurge is that the broad masses of workers and staff, while giving play to their selfless communist labor spirit, have launched a wave of technical innovation. For example, since August 27, the Civilian Lighting Factory has realized ninety-one technical innovations, and many innovation proposals have increased efficiency by one to fifteen times after implementation.

The second feature of the new upsurge is the emergence of a mass upsurge to break production quotas and create new production records. Within five days after the announcement of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, 741 out of 859 workers with production quotas in the second branch of the North China Radio Equipment Factory broke the quotas.

The third feature of this new upsurge is the emergence of a mass upsurge of counterpart competition. Following the launch of the counterpart competition of the city's foundry workers, small blast furnace workers, etc., the drums of the competition of the city's planing workers, printing workers, the coal-saving competition of the chemical industry system, and the converter competition between major steel plants have also sounded. Within many factories, there has also been a great competition between workers and workers, groups and groups, and shifts and shifts. The workers' competition is driving production forward step by step.

After entering September, the city's workers are speeding up and leaping forward more rapidly on the track of high output, high quality, and high efficiency. Many enterprises have formulated leap forward targets for completing the annual state plan ahead of schedule and surpassing the plan, as well as the leap forward plan for September. According to statistics from four industrial bureaus, four district industrial bureaus, and ten machinery factories, the total output value leap forward plan for September will increase by more than 15% compared with the actual results in August. Leading cadres of many factories bring their bedding to the workshops and fight alongside the workers on the production front line.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd -- A new upsurge of the movement to increase production and practice economy on the industrial front in Tianjin is surging forward rapidly. The workers' mobilization rallies and skill competitions are like a rising wind and surging clouds. Letters of challenge, letters of response, letters of determination, and letters of guarantee appear one after another on the walls of the factory. The good news of creating new records and realizing technical innovation projects is constantly coming. By August 30, more than 480 factories in the city had completed the full month's production plan ahead of schedule. Entering September, many factories had a good start, overfulfilling the plan every day.

In the face of this upsurge of the mass movement, all Rightist ideas that hinder the progress of the movement are like decaying and withered. In the previous period, the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory encountered some difficulties in production due to changes in products and the workers' unfamiliar production skills. A small number of cadres developed a fear of difficulties, so that the production task was not well completed. Recently, the factory's Party committee launched a mass debate among workers, and the workers put forward many opinions, mainly criticizing the leadership for not actively mobilizing the masses to overcome difficulties. The leading cadres made a serious examination and immediately marched towards difficulties with the workers. As a result, the entire factory completed the August production plan six days ahead of schedule, and the output increased by about 15.4% compared to July. After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced, the workers were even more high-spirited and proposed to increase the production of five more machine tools before the end of August. This plan was completed ahead of schedule on the 28th.

The fighting style that the leading cadres showed during the battle to seize steel last year has now been greatly carried forward. They went deep into the front line of production, led the production in a down-to-earth manner, and fully utilized the experience of the great leap forward last year to solve key production problems together with the workers. In response to the key problem of the insufficient supply of dolomite materials, the leading cadres of the Refractory Materials Factory led the workers to quickly build seventeen earthen furnaces, which timely guaranteed the needs of production. In order to ensure the normal operation of the machine and the timely supply of dolomite materials, some cadres guarded the machine day and night, and slept next to the machine when they were sleepy. Guang Kai Paper Mill analyzed that the key to increasing production and practicing economy was to increase the vehicle speed. To increase the vehicle speed involved a series of problems such as the selection and matching of raw materials and the improvement of the pulping speed. Therefore, several leading cadres went deep into the workshop and studied with the workers, and a total of five technical measures were implemented, which increased the vehicle speed by half a turn to one turn per minute. As a result, the August plan was completed one day ahead of schedule, the average daily output increased by 40.7% compared to July, and the cost per ton of paper was reduced by more than 150 yuan. It is estimated that the output in September can be increased by more than 30% compared to August.

    增产节约的新高潮气势磅礴
    江苏省职工在对手赛中经验传对手，互助如兄弟
    北京市工业战线上新创造、新纪录、新成就如泉喷湧
    天津市各厂领导干部深入生产第一线促进满堂红
    据新华社南京4日电　“反右倾、鼓干劲，为在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而斗争”的口号，动员了江苏省百万职工的积极性和创造性。全省职工擂起战鼓，投入了声势浩荡的增产节约运动高潮。
    8月以来，各种形式和各种内容的增产节约竞赛——厂际竞赛，同工种竞赛，对口竞赛，对手赛，标兵赛等等，就同时在各厂矿、车间、工段、小组和工人之间轰轰烈烈展开。南京市铸造业中的二十八个铸造厂和铸造车间的职工，展开了同工种竞赛，使铸件废品率从20％平均下降到13％。各厂各车间大闹技术革新，解决了长期解决不了的关键问题。江苏机器厂铸造车间出现的八十八项革新成果，其中如不用矽铁、使用热风炉、用白口铁熔炼成灰口铁等经验，已为全市铸造业克服材料供应不足的困难树立了榜样。
    各厂矿闹得最激烈的，是对手竞赛。常州戚墅堰机车车辆工厂铸钢车间在对手竞赛中，天天有新纪录出现。郭文成班首先创造六小时吹炼七炉优质钢的新纪录，接着金克江班创造了五个半小时炼七炉优质钢的纪录；可是不久，郭文成班又以五小时速度超过了他们。这个车间在8月份共创造了一百多项新纪录，钢的日产量由五十多吨跃进到一百吨。徐州煤矿的各个矿井，几乎每个矿工都卷入了争上游、赶先进的对手竞赛洪流；夏桥矿和韩桥矿有99％的小组参加了对手竞赛。
    在火热的竞赛浪潮中，始终是红旗在先、标兵带头。苏州东吴酒厂第六工场工人陆锦荣出酒率一直比别人高，上半年比别人多出酒五百七十七斤，最多的一个月达到五十五斤以上，工厂在提高出酒率的竞赛中，以陆锦荣为标兵，发动工人观摩他的操作，推广他的经验。结果，许多工人的出酒率都达到了五十斤以上。标兵陆锦荣继续改进操作方法，出酒率又提高到六十点零三斤。经过工人们不断追赶，现在已经有六副炉灶冲破了六十斤大关，赶上了陆锦荣；其他十七副炉灶也相继跟上，全厂平均出酒率从四十四点九斤提高到五十二点一七斤。
    “竞赛是对手，互助如兄弟”，“经验传对手，比翼上高峰”，这种互相帮助共同提高的共产主义精神，给各厂矿的竞赛运动增添了更加绚烂的光彩。扬州专区的灵岩山钢铁厂和泰州钢铁厂开展竞赛以后，两个厂职工的共同愿望就是既要胜过对方，又要帮助对方。泰州厂一号炉缺氧气，灵岩山厂的职工便把仅有的六瓶氧气分出一半用专车送到泰州。灵岩山厂一号炉的小套管烧坏了，泰州厂就将自己的备货借给他们先用。两个厂的干部也亲如兄弟，约定每天通一次电话交流经验，8月以来，两厂的产量质量都飞跃上升，成了全专区的两面红旗。更使人感动的是，徐州夏桥矿掘进四区何大生小组帮助兄弟组三次赶过自己的事迹。这个佳话传遍了徐州地区的每一个矿山。何大生小组最先领导本组工人革新了操作技术，班进度由一米七提高到三米；之后，他把自己的经验告诉沙金城小组，让沙金城小组超过了自己。何大生继续改进，班进度提高到四米。为了共同跃进，他再次把经验教给沙金城小组，让他第二次超过了自己。何大生又第三次发动工人为沙金城小组创造有利条件，帮助他们创造了五零九六米的最新纪录，再让沙金城小组走在前面。现在，各个矿井的各工区，都在学习何大生的先进思想和先进经验，力争创造更大的跃进成绩。
    据新华社4日讯　一个更大的生产高潮，正在首都工业战线上蓬勃展开。
    北京市统计局的统计表明：8月份的工业生产是今年以来增长幅度最大的月份之一。全月生产计划超额15.2％完成，工业总产值比7月份猛增19.2％。
    这个月内，钢和钢材的产量猛烈上升，钢的产量比今年以来产量最高的7月份又增加了12.7％；钢材产量约相当于今年第一季度产量的70％，比今年以来产量最高的6月份增长16.1％。生铁的产量也比7月份提高2.7％。水泥、电力、棉布、棉纱、毛织品等主要产品，都超额完成了月计划。市轻工业局所属十个工厂8月份的总产值，比7月份增长了37.4％。很多日用工业品的产量迅速增长，如肥皂比7月份增长83％，缝纫机比7月增长一倍。
    这个生产大高潮，有着深厚的思想和物质基础。去年把全市工业总产值翻了一番多的北京工业战线职工，今年以来继续高举党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉旗帜，连战连捷，在工业总产值大幅度增长的同时，普遍改进了企业管理，提高了产品质量，开展了技术大练兵，并且挖掘了物资潜力，加强了对机器设备的维修。这一系列的工作，都为继续大跃进创造了有利的条件。7月中旬以后，全市工业战线又开展了一场鼓干劲、反右倾的思想斗争，广大职工群众围绕着继续大跃进展开大鸣大放。少数干部的右倾松劲情绪受到了严肃的批评，群众的跃进意志越来越旺盛，生产也步步上升。党的八届八中全会的公报和决议是一个战斗动员令，它更有力地鼓舞着群众。当公报和决议在全体职工中传达后，一个新的生产大高潮立即掀起来。各企业纷纷开誓师大会，提出跃进计划，生产上的新纪录、新成绩如泉涌出。
    这个新的生产高潮的第一个特征，是广大工人群众在发挥忘我的共产主义劳动精神的同时，展开了技术革新的热潮。如民用灯具厂从8月27日以来，已实现了九十一项技术革新，许多革新建议实现后提高了效率一倍到十五倍。
    新高潮的第二个特征，是出现了一个群众性的突破生产定额、创造生产新纪录的热潮。华北无线电器材厂二分厂在八届八中全会文件公布后的五天内，有生产定额的八百五十九名工人中，有七百四十一人突破了定额。
    这个新高潮的第三个特征，是出现了一个群众性的对口竞赛热潮。继全市铸工、小高炉工人等的对口竞赛开展以后，全市刨工的竞赛、印刷工人的竞赛、化工系统的节约煤炭竞赛和主要钢厂之间的转炉竞赛的战鼓又擂响了。许多工厂内部，也掀起了工人和工人、组与组、班与班之间的大竞赛。职工们的竞赛推动着生产一步一步地前进。
    在进入9月份之后，全市职工快马加鞭，在高产高质高效率的轨道上，更加飞跃前进。许多企业订出了提前超额完成全年国家计划的跃进指标和9月份的跃进计划。据四个工业局、四个区工业局和十个机械厂的统计，9月份的总产值跃进计划将比8月份的实绩再提高15％以上。许多工厂的领导干部带上铺盖下车间，在生产前线和工人共同奋战。
    据新华社天津3日电　天津市工业战线上的增产节约运动新高潮来势迅猛。职工们的誓师大会、比武大会有如风起云涌。挑战书、应战书、决心书、保证书一批接着一批地出现在工厂的墙壁上。创造新纪录、实现技术革新项目的捷报不断传来。到8月30日，全市就有四百八十多个工厂提前完成了全月生产计划。进入9月份，许多工厂更是开门红，日日超额完成计划。
    在这个群众运动的高潮面前，一切障碍运动前进的右倾思想有如摧枯拉朽。前一时期，天津第一机床厂由于产品改变，工人生产技术不熟练，生产上遇到一些困难，一小部分干部就产生了畏难情绪，以致生产任务完成得不好。最近，工厂党委发动职工大鸣大放，工人们提出许多意见，主要是批评领导上没有积极发动群众战胜困难。领导干部认真作了检查，并且立即同职工一道向困难进军，结果全厂提前六天完成了8月份生产计划，产量比7月份增加15.4％左右。党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，职工们更是意气风发，又提出在8月底以前增产五台机床的计划，这个计划到28日又提前完成了。
    领导干部去年在夺钢大战时表现出来的那种战斗作风，现在又大大发扬起来。他们深入生产第一线，踏踏实实地领导生产，并且充分运用去年大跃进中的经验，同职工一起解决生产关键问题。耐火器材厂的领导干部针对白云石料供应不上的关键，带领职工迅速修起十七座土炉，及时保证了生产的需要。为了保证机器运转正常，白云石料供应及时，有的干部日夜守护着机器，困了就睡在机器旁边。广开造纸厂分析了增产节约的关键是提高车速，要提高车速又牵涉到原料的挑选、搭配和提高打浆速度等一系列的问题。于是，几个领导干部深入到车间，同职工一起研究，共实现了五项技术措施，使车速每分钟提高半转到一转，结果8月份计划提前一天完成，平均日产量比7月份提高40.7％，每吨纸降低成本一百五十余元。预计9月份产量比8月份还可以再提高30％以上。
