Xinhua News Agency, 26th Tokyo Dispatch: Former Japanese Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan said today upon his return to Tokyo after visiting China that he is determined to strive for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, based on the communiqué issued in Beijing concerning his talks with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.

Mr. Ishibashi and his entourage were welcomed at Tokyo Airport by hundreds of Japanese political figures and citizens.

Mr. Ishibashi stated at the airport: "With the warm support of the people, I have safely concluded my two-week visit to China. In Beijing, I held multiple talks with Premier Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister Chen Yi, and other Chinese government leaders, and exchanged views in a deep and frank manner on issues such as opening up the current relations between Japan and China, the two countries joining hands to safeguard peace in the Far East, and contributing to world peace." He said this would help restore friendly relations between the two countries.

Mr. Ishibashi said: The main points of the consensus reached by both sides have been published in the communiqué signed with Premier Zhou on the 20th. I believe that this is the first step towards the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. From now on, I am determined to work for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China based on the communiqué.

Mr. Ishibashi finally expressed his hope that the Japanese people would give him their support.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th Tokyo Dispatch: Former Japanese Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan said today that China is a peace-loving country, and the hostile policy towards China should be completely reconsidered.

Ishibashi made these remarks when answering questions at his first press conference after returning from his visit to the People's Republic of China.

He said: “If Sino-Japanese relations are allowed to drift, they will be completely destroyed. I will suggest that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi revise his 'wait-and-see' attitude towards China, as well as the policy of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and take positive steps to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations."

Ishibashi also said: "Politics and economics are inseparable, which is very natural. A hostile policy and trade are mutually contradictory." When asked by a reporter about his opinion on the remarks made by Secretary-General of the ruling party, Masajiro Kawashima, attacking Premier Zhou and the communiqué issued by him, Ishibashi said: "Unless the spirit of the communiqué is realized, it will be impossible to promote Sino-Japanese friendship."

    石桥湛山回到东京
    表示将以北京会谈公报为基础争取中日复交
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本前首相石桥湛山今天在访问中国后回到东京时说，他决心以在北京发表的中国总理周恩来同他举行会谈的公报为基础，争取早日恢复中日两国的邦交。
    石桥先生和他的随行人员在东京机场受到日本政界人士和市民数百人的欢迎。
    石桥先生在机场上发表声明说：“在人民热情的支持下，我已平安地结束了在中国的为时两星期的访问。我在北京同周总理、陈毅外长等中国政府领导人举行了多次会谈，就打开日中两国目前的关系、两国携起手来维护远东和平以及为世界和平作出贡献这些问题深入地、坦率地交换了意见。他说，这有助于恢复两国之间的友好关系。
    石桥先生说：双方取得的一致意见的主要点已经在20日签署的同周总理的会谈公报中发表了。我相信，这样就向日中邦交正常化方向迈出了第一步。今后，我决心要以公报为基础，为早日恢复日中两国邦交而努力。
    石桥先生最后表示希望日本人民给他以支持。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本前首相石桥湛山今天说，中国是爱好和平的国家，对中国采取的敌视政策应当全盘加以重新考虑。
    石桥是在访问中华人民共和国回来后第一次举行的记者招待会上回答问题时这样说的。
    他说：“中日关系如果任其自流，就会完全遭到破坏。我将建议岸信介首相修改对中国所采取的‘观望’态度，以及修改美日安全条约的政策，并且采取积极的步骤来打开中日关系的僵局。”
    石桥还说：“政治和经济不可分割，这是很自然的。敌视政策和贸易是互相矛盾的。”记者问他对执政党干事长川岛正次郎攻击周总理和他发表的会谈公报的谈话有何意见，石桥说：“除非实现公报的精神，否则无法增进中日友好关系。”
