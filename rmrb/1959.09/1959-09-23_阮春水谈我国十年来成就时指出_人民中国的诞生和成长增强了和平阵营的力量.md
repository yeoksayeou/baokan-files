Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, Electric Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China, delivered a report at a meeting held by the preparatory committee on the 16th. He said that the birth and growth of People's China has greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and has completely changed the balance of power between socialism and capitalism on a global scale.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy pointed out in his report to more than a thousand cadres of state organs that the success of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China were the most important historical events after the Great Russian Socialist Revolution. Nguyen Xuan Thuy continued by saying that because the Chinese Communist Party has made great achievements in all aspects over the past ten years, it has made significant contributions to the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism. He said that the People's Republic of China is a strong fortress of peace in the Far East and Asia, and it always stands at the forefront together with the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp in opposing aggressive colonialism and imperialism and defending world peace. Nguyen Xuan Thuy said that the Chinese revolution has a long-standing relationship with the Vietnamese revolution, and that the Chinese Communist Party, government, and people are the comrades and close brothers of the Vietnamese Labor Party, government, and people, constantly providing lofty proletarian internationalist assistance in every period of the Vietnamese people's revolution.

Nguyen Xuan Thuy said, after pointing out that the Vietnamese people have learned many experiences from the Chinese revolution, "We must continue to strengthen the study of the valuable experiences of the Chinese revolution, that is, creatively applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the actual situation of our country, as well as the Chinese people's perseverance in building socialism,and learn from the Chinese technicians who are helping us in our national construction."

Nguyen Van Tran, Vice-Chairman of the State Planning Commission, and To Huu, a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China, then spoke at the meeting about the achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward, China's generous assistance to the Vietnamese people, and China's cultural and ideological revolution.

    阮春水谈我国十年来成就时指出
    人民中国的诞生和成长增强了和平阵营的力量
    新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道，越南庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年筹备委员会副主席阮春水16日在这个筹备委员会举行的报告会上作报告。他说，人民中国的诞生和成长大大地增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，并且在世界范围内完全改变了社会主义和资本主义之间的力量对比。
    阮春水在对一千多名国家机关干部做报告时指出，中国革命的成功和中华人民共和国的成立是继伟大的俄国社会主义革命以后的最重要的历史事件。阮春水接着说，由于中国共产党在过去十年中在各方面都取得了伟大的成就，因此它对马克思列宁主义的理论和实践作出了重大的贡献。他说，中华人民共和国是远东和亚洲和平的坚强堡垒，它在反对侵略成性的殖民主义和帝国主义以及保卫世界和平方面总是同苏联和社会主义阵营的其它国家一起站在最前列。阮春水说，中国革命同越南革命有着悠久的关系，中国共产党、政府和人民是越南劳动党、政府和人民的战友和亲密的兄弟，在越南人民革命的各个时期不断给予崇高的无产阶级国际主义的帮助。
    阮春水在指出越南人民从中国革命中学到了许多经验后说，“我们必须继续加强研究中国革命的宝贵经验，即把马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想创造性地运用于我国的实际情况，以及中国人民坚韧不拔地建设社会主义的精神，并且向帮助我们进行国家建设的中国技术人员学习”。
    国家计划委员会副主任阮文珍和庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年筹备委员会委员素友接着在会上谈到中国人民在大跃进中所取得的成就，中国给越南人民的慷慨援助以及中国的文化和思想革命。
