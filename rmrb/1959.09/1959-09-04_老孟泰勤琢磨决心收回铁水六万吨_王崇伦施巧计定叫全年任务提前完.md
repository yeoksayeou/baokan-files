    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd. Inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee, many famous advanced producers and advanced collectives in Anshan Iron and Steel are full of vigor and determined to make new and greater contributions in this year's continued Great Leap Forward.
    National model worker and old hero of Anshan Iron and Steel's iron smelting plant, Meng Tai, whose hair is already graying, still fights day and night by the blast furnace like a young man. Not long ago, he and the workers of the piping section studied and decided to make full use of the heat inside the hot blast stove flue to save coal, and use this as a gift to celebrate National Day. Recently, after hearing the call of the Party, after repeated deliberation, he decided to work with Li Guozhong, the head of the piping section, and others to innovate another technology: welding the hot blast stove water jacket and hot blast valve with iron plates instead of casting them with copper. The copper-cast water jackets and hot blast valves have pinholes and expand and crack when exposed to high temperatures. Replacing them with iron plate welding can reduce the loss of 60,000 tons of molten iron every year. The old hero is determined to win back this molten iron.
    Wang Chonglun, a nationally renowned innovation expert, is now the deputy director of the youth tool workshop of the Northern Machinery Repair Factory. After taking on leadership work, he still often goes to the site to operate and innovate technology with the workers. In the past three months alone, he has helped the workshop workers achieve many technological innovations, and he himself has achieved seven technological innovations, greatly improving production efficiency. He plans to help the workers improve and innovate technology again, and he himself will achieve four more technological innovations by the end of the year, ensuring that the entire workshop completes the annual plan twenty days ahead of schedule.
    Li Shaokui, the chief furnace operator of the No. 7 open-hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, who risked his life to rescue the open-hearth furnace not long ago, was very excited after listening to the broadcast of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The next day, he arrived at the open-hearth furnace three hours early to help the previous shift of workers maintain the furnace body. He proposed to work with the workers to do everything possible to maintain the furnace body, eliminate accidents, and take innovative measures such as more loading and faster smelting to ensure the completion of the annual plan ahead of schedule. Since the beginning of this year, this famous advanced producer, together with other workers, has realized many innovative proposals, and at the same time learned the experience of No. 6 open-hearth furnace in maintaining the furnace body, thus increasing the production of more than 2,000 tons of high-quality steel for the country in May alone.
    The utilization coefficient of the Youth Unity Furnace of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant has always been leading among the large open-hearth furnaces in the country. The workers of this furnace responded to the call of the Party and decided to adopt measures such as strengthening furnace body maintenance and implementing more loading and faster smelting to increase the operating rate from the current 84% to 88%; the smelting time of each furnace of steel is one hour shorter than in July, ensuring that the country will increase the production of 10,000 tons of high-quality steel in the next four months. Ning Changzeng, the furnace chief of the No. 9 soaking furnace in the No. 1 Blooming Mill, who is famous for innovating steel heating technology, proposed to work with the workers of the entire furnace to do everything possible to increase the furnace temperature, continue to innovate technology, and strive to shorten the steel heating time by half compared with the national plan, while overcoming the difficulty of heating cold steel ingots, so that the blooming mill can roll out more and better steel billets to meet the needs of various steel rolling mills to increase steel production. Last year, Ning Changzeng boldly innovated steel heating technology despite the obstruction of conservatives, which doubled the efficiency of steel heating.
    Advanced producers and advanced collectives in many other factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel have also recently formulated new plans. The No. 20 open-hearth furnace, one of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, has overfulfilled the state plan every month since the beginning of this year, and increased the production of more than 13,300 tons of high-quality steel from January to July. Now the workers are determined to continue to carry out technical performances, innovate steelmaking technology, and produce more high-quality steel for the country in the next four months.

    老孟泰勤琢磨决心收回铁水六万吨  王崇伦施巧计定叫全年任务提前完
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍钢许多著名的先进生产者和先进集体，在党中央的伟大号召鼓舞下，英气焕发，决心在今年继续跃进中作出新的更大的贡献。
    全国劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂老英雄孟泰，头发已经斑白了，仍然同青年人一样日夜战斗在高炉旁。不久前，他同配管工段职工研究，决定充分利用热风炉烟道里边的热量，节省煤炭，并以此作为向国庆节的献礼。最近，他听到党的号召后，经过反复琢磨，决定同配管工段段长李国忠等人一起，再革新一项技术：用铁板焊接热风炉水套和热风瓣，代替用铜铸造水套和热风瓣。用铜铸造的水套和热风瓣有沙眼，一经高温就膨胀裂缝，改用铁板焊接，每年可以减少六万吨铁水的损失。老英雄已下定决心要把这些铁水夺回来。
    全国闻名的革新能手王崇伦，现在是北部机修厂青年工具车间副主任。他担任领导工作以后，还是经常到现场同工人一起操作和革新技术。仅在最近三个月里，他就帮助车间工人实现了许多项技术革新，自己也实现了七项技术革新，大大提高了生产效率。他计划再帮助工人改进和革新技术，自己到年底也再实现四项技术革新，保证全车间提前二十天完成全年计划。
    不久以前冒着生命危险抢救平炉的鞍钢第一炼钢厂七号平炉总炉长李绍奎，听到党的八届八中全会公报和决议的广播后，非常兴奋，第二天提前三小时来到平炉上，帮助上一班工人维护炉体。他提出要同工人一起千方百计地维护好炉体，消灭事故，并且采取多装快炼的革新措施，保证提前完成全年计划。今年以来，这位著名的先进生产者，同别的工人一起实现了好多项革新建议，同时学习了六号平炉维护炉体的经验，因而在5月一个月里就为国家增产二千多吨优质钢。
    第二炼钢厂青年团结炉在全国大型平炉中利用系数一直领先。这个炉子的工人们响应党的号召，决定采用加强炉体维护、实行多装快炼等措施，把作业率从现在的84％提高到88％；每炉钢的熔炼时间比7月份缩短一小时，保证在今后四个月里为国家增产一万吨优质钢。革新烧钢技术闻名的第一初轧厂均热工段九号均热炉炉长宁长增，提出要同全炉工人一起，千方百计提高炉温，继续革新技术，力争使烧钢时间比国家计划缩短一半，同时克服烧冷钢锭的困难，让初轧机轧出更多更好的钢坯，满足各轧钢厂增产钢材的需要。去年，宁长增不顾保守主义者的阻碍，大胆革新了烧钢技术，使烧钢效率提高了一倍。
    鞍钢其它许多厂矿的先进生产者和先进集体，最近也纷纷订出新的计划。五座大型固定式平炉中的二十号平炉，今年以来月月超额完成了国家计划，1月到7月共增产了优质钢一万三千三百多吨。现在工人们决心继续开展技术表演，革新炼钢技术，在今后四个月里为国家增产更多的优质钢。
