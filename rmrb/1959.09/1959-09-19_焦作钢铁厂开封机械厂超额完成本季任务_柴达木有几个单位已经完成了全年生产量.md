Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: Workers on the steel front in Jiaozuo City, Henan Province, have completed their third-quarter pig iron production plan sixteen days ahead of schedule, with a pig iron qualification rate of 90%. The city's steelworkers are determined to produce another 8,000 tons of pig iron in September as a gift to celebrate the great 10th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

Since the third quarter, workers in Jiaozuo City's steel plants have been fighting heroically to complete the state plan ahead of schedule. Especially after the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were conveyed, the workers were greatly encouraged and quickly launched a high tide of learning from and catching up with the advanced to increase production and practice thrift. The pig iron output of the Jiaonan Steel Plant increased from more than 70 tons per day to more than 120 tons, and in September it jumped to more than 170 tons. No. 3 blast furnace of Jiaonan Steel Plant and No. 2 blast furnace of Jiaobei Steel Plant carried out a competition, and the utilization coefficient increased from 0.5 and 0.4 to 1.08 and 1.05 respectively. Jiaonan and Jiaobei Steel Plants adopted the method of "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to carry out eight technical transformations on small blast furnaces, such as thickening cold air and hot air pipelines and improving the bending of air pipes, so that the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces increased from 0.444 in July to 0.754, and the quality of iron was also significantly improved.

During this period, the Jiaozuo Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized more than 50 leading cadres to help solve production problems in various steel plants, which played a great role in encouraging workers and promoting production.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: Workers at the Kaifeng Machinery Factory in Henan Province have already realized their plan to dedicate achievements to National Day. On September 15, they overfulfilled the annual production task of manufacturing 300 grain combine harvesters by five units.

The Kaifeng Machinery Factory only started trial-producing grain combine harvesters this year. In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production and accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, the workers of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory spent only 39 days to complete the trial production stage, and officially put them into batch production in early April. By mid-August, the factory had produced 180 units. Since mid-August, thanks to the factory's in-depth development of a mass movement to oppose right-leaning ideas and boost morale to increase production and practice thrift, as many as 3,157 person-times of technical innovations and new records have emerged in the factory, and more than 120 units have been produced in one month.

The production progress of other products of Kaifeng Machinery Factory this year has also been very rapid. All the workers of the factory are striving to complete all the annual production tasks before National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, Qaidam, 18th: Several units in the Qaidam area of Qinghai Province have overfulfilled their production or transportation plans for this year.

The Yuka Coal Mine planned to produce 50,000 tons of raw coal this year. By September 10, it had completed this plan ahead of schedule and overproduced 225 tons. The Lücaoshan Coal Mine planned to produce 40,000 tons of raw coal and 30,000 pieces of ceramics throughout the year, both of which had been overfulfilled by September 10. The motorcade of the Qaidam Industrial Bureau also completed this year's transportation turnover and freight volume plans ahead of schedule.

These units have used the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward to carry out mass movements, so that production has risen steadily and costs have continued to decline. For example, the Yuka Coal Mine produced 5,803 tons of coal in the first ten days of September, which is almost equal to the entire monthly output in April. The average cost in the first half of the year was 70% lower than last year, and in August it was 14% lower than the average in the first half of the year. The leading cadres of the motorcade of the Qaidam Industrial Bureau used the method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, so that the backward caught up with the advanced. The drivers carried out a competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced, which improved transportation efficiency. The repair workshop closely cooperated to ensure that minor repairs were completed overnight and major repairs were completed within three days, ensuring transportation needs.

    焦作钢铁厂开封机械厂超额完成本季任务
    柴达木有几个单位已经完成了全年生产量
    新华社郑州18日电　河南省焦作市钢铁战线的职工已提前十六天完成第三季度生铁产量计划，生铁合格率达到90％。全市钢铁战士决心在9月份内再增产生铁八千吨，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。
    第三季度以来，焦作市各钢铁厂的职工们为提前超额完成国家计划，进行了英勇的奋战。特别是在党的八届八中全会公报和决议传达以后，职工们受到很大鼓舞，迅速掀起了学先进、赶先进的增产节约竞赛高潮。焦南钢铁厂的生铁产量由日产七十多吨提高到一百二十多吨，9月份又跃进到一百七十多吨。焦南钢铁厂三号高炉和焦北钢铁厂二号高炉开展了对手赛，利用系数由零点五、零点四，分别提高到一点零八和一点零五。焦南、焦北钢铁厂采取领导干部、工人和技术员“三结合”的办法，对小高炉进行了加粗冷风、热风管道、改进风管的弯度等八项技术改造，使小高炉平均利用系数由7月份零点四四四提高到零点七五四，铁的质量也有显著提高。
    在这一时期，中共焦作市委组织了五十多名领导干部，分别到各钢铁厂帮助解决生产中的问题，对于鼓舞工人和推动生产起了很大作用。
    新华社郑州18日电　河南开封机械厂职工已经提前实现了向国庆献礼的计划，在9月15日超额五台完成了全年制造三百台谷物联合收割机的生产任务。
    开封机械厂今年才开始试制谷物联合收割机。为了支援农业生产大跃进，加快实现农业机械化，开封机械厂的职工们只用三十九天的时间就结束了试制阶段，在4月初正式成批投入生产。到8月中旬，全厂就生产了一百八十台。从8月中旬以来，由于这个厂深入开展了反右倾、鼓干劲的群众性增产节约运动，全厂出现的技术革新和新纪录达三千一百五十七人次之多，在一个月当中就生产出一百二十多台。
    开封机械厂今年生产的其它产品，进展也很快。全厂职工正力争在国庆节前完成全年的各项生产任务。
    新华社柴达木18日电　青海省柴达木地区已有几个单位超额完成了今年的生产或运输计划。
    鱼卡煤矿今年计划生产原煤五万吨，到9月10日已提前完成这个计划，并超产二百二十五吨。绿草山煤矿计划全年生产原煤四万吨、陶瓷三万件，都已在9月10日双双超额完成。柴达木工业局汽车队也提前完成了今年的运输周转量和货运量计划。
    这几个单位今年都运用去年大跃进的经验大搞群众运动，使生产节节上升，成本不断降低。如鱼卡煤矿9月上旬产煤五千八百零三吨，差不多等于4月份全月产量。上半年的成本平均比去年降低70％，8月又比上半年平均降低14％。柴达木工业局汽车队的领导干部，运用抓两头带中间的办法，使落后赶上先进，司机们开展了学先进、赶先进的竞赛，提高了运输效率。修理车间紧密配合，做到了小修不过夜，中修不过三天，保证了运输需要。
