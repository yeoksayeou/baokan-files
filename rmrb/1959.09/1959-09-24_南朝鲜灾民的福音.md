    Good News for South Korean Disaster Victims
    By Our Commentator
    The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a plenary meeting on September 23 to discuss the issue of providing relief to South Korean disaster victims. It was decided to establish a committee for the relief of South Korean disaster victims and to allocate large quantities of rice, textiles, cement, timber, shoes, and other materials to help South Korean disaster victims who have suffered from floods and typhoons. It is also prepared to receive disaster victims from southern Korea who seek refuge in the democratic base of the north to make a living. This decision fully embodies the cordial concern of the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the residents of southern Korea. For the South Korean disaster victims who are in dire straits, this is good news from the north of their homeland.
    The north and south of Korea are separated by only a line, yet there is a world of difference between them. The people of northern Korea are full of vigor, riding the "Chollima," forging ahead in construction with vigor and prosperity; while southern Korea, even without natural disasters, suffers from man-made disasters. The fascist rule of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique is more harmful than natural disasters. Now, in addition to man-made disasters, there are also major natural disasters. According to statistics released by the South Korean authorities alone, as of September 23, thousands of people have lost their lives due to the recent floods and typhoons, and 800,000 disaster victims have lost their homes, household goods, and fields, and are on the verge of life and death. As pointed out in the decision of the Cabinet meeting of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the frequent natural disasters in South Korea are the result of the failure of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee authorities to carry out any irrigation projects and mountain and river management. The American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique are only trying to extract everything they can from the residents of South Korea and do everything they can to exploit and oppress them. Of course, they will not care about the life and death of the people.
    The decision of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on providing relief to South Korean disaster victims demonstrates the fraternal feelings of the people of northern Korea towards their compatriots in the south. The Korean people are well aware that the misfortune and suffering of South Korea today are the dire consequences of the artificial division of Korea into two parts by American imperialism. All Korean people urgently demand that the American aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea in order to realize the peaceful reunification of Korea and allow the people of northern and southern Korea to join hands and jointly create their beautiful life.

    南朝鲜灾民的福音
    本报评论员
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁于9月23日举行全体会议，讨论了救济南朝鲜灾民的问题，并且作出决定成立救济南朝鲜灾民委员会，拨出大米、纺织品、水泥、木材、鞋等大量物资，以救济遭受到水灾和风灾的南朝鲜灾民，同时还准备接待从朝鲜南部投奔北方民主基地，以谋求生路的灾民。这个决定充分地体现了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民对于朝鲜南部居民的亲切的关怀。对于正处在水深火热之中的南朝鲜灾民来说，这是一个来自他们祖国北方的一个福音。
    朝鲜北部和南部仅一线之隔，竟有天壤之别。朝鲜北部人民意气风发，跨上“千里马”，建设事业一往直前，欣欣向荣；而朝鲜南部即使没有天灾，也有人祸，美帝国主义和李承晚集团的法西斯统治，其祸害甚于天灾。现在，人祸之外，又加上特大的天灾，仅据南朝鲜当局发表的统计，由于最近的水灾和风灾，到9月23日为止，已有成千的人牺牲了生命，八十万灾民失去了房屋，家庭用具和田地，处在生死关头。正如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁会议的决定所指出的，南朝鲜天灾频仍，是由于美帝国主义和李承晚当局没有进行任何灌溉工程和治山治水的结果。美帝国主义者和李承晚集团只是千方百计从南朝鲜居民身上敲骨吸髓，竭尽剥削压榨的能事，他们当然不会关心人民的死活。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于救济南朝鲜灾民的决定，表现了朝鲜北部人民对于南部同胞的手足之情。朝鲜人民深知，今天南朝鲜的不幸和痛苦是朝鲜被美帝国主义人为地分裂为两个部分所造成的恶劣后果。全体朝鲜人民迫切地要求美国侵略军从南朝鲜撤出去，以实现朝鲜的和平统一，让朝鲜北部和南部的人民携起手来，共同创造他们美好的生活。
