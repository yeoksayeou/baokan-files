Letter of Greetings from the East Pakistan Central Committee of the Communist Party of Pakistan
Dear Comrades!

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we, on behalf of our Party and the people of Pakistan, extend our warm fraternal congratulations to you and, through you, to the great Chinese people. We cannot express in words how much we wish to be with you all at this grand festival. However, due to the extremely reactionary military dictatorship in our country, it is impossible for us to send a delegation.

    Our country is going through critical times. The reactionary ruling clique in our country—the big feudal lords and the big monopoly bourgeoisie—in collusion with imperialism, especially US imperialism, has abolished our country’s constitution, which our people once hoped would achieve full parliamentary democracy. Seeing that the people of our country are increasingly united in their attitude towards certain democratic demands, such as demanding the severance of all ties with imperialist war treaties, demanding a neutral and independent foreign policy, demanding full autonomy for all nationalities in Pakistan, demanding thorough land reform, etc., the imperialists and their accomplices in our country do not even dare to allow the existence of a bourgeois parliamentary system in our country. So they implemented military dictatorship and adopted a policy of brutally suppressing all democratic rights, democratic ideas, democratic concepts and democratic organizations of our people. As the reactionaries destroy all civil liberties, throw many patriotic leaders and workers into prison, and implement a reign of terror, they are increasingly falling into the war bloc of imperialism. Imperialism is plotting to use our country as a war base against the Soviet Union, China and other socialist and peace-loving countries.

    Our Party, though small, has taken an unambiguous revolutionary stand against the imperialists and their accomplices in our country, and against military dictatorship and its reactionary policies. Our Party is doing its best to unite all democratic and patriotic forces under the banner of peace, freedom and democracy. The military regime has made all the problems of our people more serious, and the illusions of our people about this regime are also being shattered. Our Party is striving to mobilize the democratic and patriotic forces of all strata to strive for the formulation of a democratic constitution and the enjoyment of full civil liberties, as the current steps to be taken.

    In our struggle for peace, democracy and freedom, we take the glorious revolutionary struggle experience of the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party as our guide. The epoch-making achievements of the People's Republic of China and the great achievements of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have strengthened us and made us believe that the peace-loving people of the whole world will defeat the imperialist warmongers and reactionaries. We can and must smash the conspiracies plotted by domestic and foreign reactionaries in Pakistan. Comrade Mao Zedong's famous saying "All imperialists are paper tigers" encourages us and gives us more courage to defeat the imperialists and their accomplices in our country.

    Comrades, at this joyous moment of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, let us once again express our congratulations and respect to you and the Chinese people.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the people of Pakistan!
    Long live the Communist Party of China and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong!
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani people!
    Eliminate the imperialist warmongers and their accomplices!

          With revolutionary greetings,
                            East Pakistan Central Committee of the Communist Party of Pakistan
                                          September 2, 1959

### 巴基斯坦共产党东巴中央委员会的贺信

    巴基斯坦共产党东巴中央委员会的贺信亲爱的同志们！
    在中华人民共和国成立十周年之际，我们代表我们的党和巴基斯坦人民向你们并通过你们向伟大的中国人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。我们无法用言语来表达我们是多么希望在这个盛大的节日同你们相聚一堂。但是，由于我国的极其反动的军事独裁统治，我们不可能派出代表团。
    我们的国家正经历着危急的时日。我国的反动统治集团——大封建主和大垄断资产阶级同帝国主义特别是美帝国主义勾结在一起，废除了我国的宪法，而我国人民是曾经希望通过这个宪法来实现充分的议会民主的。帝国主义者及其在我国的同谋者，看到我国人民对于某些民主要求的态度日趋一致，例如，要求同帝国主义的战争条约断绝一切联系，要求奉行中立的独立外交政策，要求给巴基斯坦各民族以充分的自治权，要求实行彻底的土地改革等等，甚至不敢让资产阶级的议会制度在我国存在下去。于是他们就实行军事独裁统治，并采取凶残地压制我国人民的一切民主权利、民主思想、民主观念和民主组织的政策。由于反动派摧毁一切公民自由，把许多爱国领袖和工人投入监狱，施行恐怖的统治，他们正日益陷入帝国主义的战争集团。帝国主义正阴谋利用我国作为反对苏联、中国及其他社会主义和爱好和平的国家的战争基地。
    我们党虽然很弱小，但是采取了毫不含糊的革命立场，来反对帝国主义者及其在我国的同谋者，反对军事独裁及其反动政策。我们党正竭尽全力在和平、自由和民主的旗帜下，团结一切民主爱国力量。军事政权已经使我国人民的一切问题更加严重，而我国人民对这个政权所抱的幻想也正在破灭。我们党正在竭力动员各阶层的民主爱国力量，争取制定一部民主宪法和享有充分的公民自由，并以此作为当前的行动步骤。
    在我们争取和平、民主和自由的斗争中，我们以在中国共产党领导下的伟大的中国人民的光辉的革命斗争经验作为我们的指南。中华人民共和国所获得的划时代的成就以及以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的巨大成就，给我们增加了力量，并使我们相信全世界爱好和平的人民必将击败帝国主义战争贩子和反动派。我们能够而且必须粉碎国内外反动派在巴基斯坦所策划的阴谋。毛泽东同志的“一切帝国主义都是纸老虎”这一句名言使我们得到鼓舞，更有勇气去击败帝国主义者及其在我国的同谋者。
    同志们，在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年这个欢乐的时刻，让我们再一次向你们和中国人民表致我们的贺意和敬意。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    巴基斯坦人民万岁！
    中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    中巴两国人民的友谊万岁！
    消灭帝国主义战争贩子及其同谋者！
          谨　致革命的敬礼
                            巴基斯坦共产党东巴中央委员会
                                          1959年9月2日
