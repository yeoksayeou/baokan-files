Dear friends,

Our delegation from the International Union of Students is very happy and greatly honored to extend our heartfelt congratulations to you and, through you, to the great Chinese people on the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Although our congratulatory message is short, we want you to know the profound feeling of respect, admiration, and love for the Chinese people that we hold, a feeling shared by the majority of students worldwide.

In praising your current achievements, we are fully aware that these achievements are the result of a long revolutionary struggle. The Chinese people, including students, have made many sacrifices in this struggle. The Monument to the People's Heroes, standing in front of this magnificent Great Hall of the People, is one of the proofs of the Chinese people's high praise for the heroic role played by Chinese students in the May Fourth Movement and many other occasions. The active participation of Chinese students in the revolutionary movement in the past and their dedication to socialist construction today provide great encouragement to students in other countries. They show that as long as students dedicate themselves to their people and serve progress with all their knowledge, they can play an important role in the life of their country.

The International Union of Students was born during the Second World War, in the common struggle of students against German and Italian fascism and Japanese militarism. It unites students from different countries and different opinions on the basis of the common struggle for peace and against colonialism and imperialism. Since its establishment, it has always supported the Chinese revolution, and we are very proud of this. The International Union of Students fully supported the struggle of the Chinese people and students against the Kuomintang reactionary regime. It cheered the founding of the People's Republic of China, and it has always demanded full recognition of your Republic's international rights. It firmly supports the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, and it warmly welcomes your achievements in peaceful construction under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Dear friends, we sincerely wish you new achievements in further developing your great and beautiful country, developing the cause of peace, and promoting friendship between all countries.

Long live the great Chinese people and the People's Republic of China!

Long live world peace! (Attached picture)

    国际学生联合会主席、国际学生联合会代表团团长
    尤利·贝利康的贺词亲爱的朋友们：
    我们国际学生联合会代表团感到非常高兴和莫大的荣幸，在中华人民共和国光辉的建国十周年向你们、并通过你们向伟大的中国人民表示我们衷心的祝贺。虽然我们的贺词不长，我们愿意你们了解我们非常尊重、佩服和热爱中国人民这种深厚的感情，而这种感情是全世界大多数学生所共有的。
    在赞扬你们目前的成就时，我们完全知道这些成就是长期革命斗争的结果。中国人民包括学生在这个斗争中曾作出了许多牺牲。矗立在这个极其美妙的大会堂前面的人民英雄纪念碑，就是中国人民盛赞中国学生在五四运动和其他许多场合中所起的英勇作用的证明之一。中国学生过去积极参加革命运动和今天献身于社会主义建设的行动，给予其他国家的学生以莫大的鼓舞。他们表明学生只要献身于他们的人民而且以他们的全部知识为进步服务，他们在自己的国家生活中就可以起重要的作用。
    国际学生联合会是在第二次世界大战期间，在学生们对德国和意大利法西斯主义以及日本军国主义的共同斗争中产生的，它在争取和平、反对殖民主义和帝国主义的共同斗争的基础上把不同国家和不意见的学生团结在一起。自从它成立以来，它就一直支持中国的革命，我们对这一点感到非常自豪。国际学联完全支持中国人民和学生对国民党反动政权的斗争。它曾为中华人民共和国的成立而欢呼，它一直要求完全承认你们共和国的国际权利。它坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的决心，它热烈欢迎你们在毛泽东主席英明的领导下在和平建设方面取得的成就。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们衷心地祝你们在进一步发展你们伟大而美丽的国家、发展和平事业和各国之间的友谊方面取得新的成就。
    伟大的中国人民和中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
