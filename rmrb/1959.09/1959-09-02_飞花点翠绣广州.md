    Embroidering Guangzhou with Flying Flowers and Touches of Green	Qin Mu

    Guangzhou—the mere mention of its name evokes a sense of connecting with eternity. Imagine, more than two thousand years ago, this was a vast expanse of coastline where people built a small "Nanwu City" by the mountains and the sea. And this city, after more than two thousand years of vicissitudes, has not been submerged or abandoned, but has grown day by day, with the sea gradually receding far from the bustling city. It has finally become a great famous city. For more than two thousand years, how many cities in the world have been built and then destroyed by war, buried in wind and sand, or sunk into the sea, destroyed by earthquakes, quietly disappearing from maps? Yet this ancient coastal city of our country has stood for a long time. In the last ten years, it has shone even more brilliantly. In the past, when people mentioned Guangzhou, they would think of it as a city with a long history, a city with very early international exchanges, a city filled with subtropical scenery, and a heroic city with numerous revolutionary sites. But now, one more item should be added: it is a great socialist industrial city!

    All these intensely colorful characteristics intertwine to make Guangzhou so beautiful!

    Speaking of the changes in this city over the past ten years, I am reminded of the scene of skilled women embroidering. Some skillful women place a round embroidery frame on their laps, and their needles fly up and down. In an instant, flowers appear, birds appear, and pavilions and towers also appear. People always praise these skillful hands, saying, "They are embroidering flying flowers and touches of green, drawing dragons and embroidering phoenixes!" Now, cities have become huge "embroidery frames," and the Party leads the working people in construction. One moment, a row of factories appears here, the next moment, a street appears there, and the next moment, a park springs up somewhere else. It is just like miraculous embroidery needles that embroider in an instant. Guangzhou is a city with many flowers and trees, and the progress of its construction especially reminds me of the superb skills of skillful women embroidering flying flowers and touches of green.

    Take trees as an example! This subtropical city, where the Tropic of Cancer affectionately passes through its north, has trees and flowers everywhere. Many of the old trees lining the roads have weathered more than a century. They bloom almost all year round. Kapok and phoenix trees bloom with scarlet flowers, locust trees bloom with goose-yellow flowers, Aleurites moluccanus trees bloom with beige flowers, Bauhinia trees bloom with purple flowers, Magnolia trees bloom with pure white flowers..., plus the colorful flowers on the flower stalls along the road, the colors are truly magnificent. Now, it has become even more lush and verdant everywhere. In these years, Guangzhou's urban area has added hundreds of thousands of roadside trees, and Guangzhou's suburbs have added millions of fruit trees. Speaking only of parks! Ten new and expanded parks have been built. Each of these parks will have a unique style in the future. Some are colorful, some have towering ancient trees, and some have South Pacific scenery. The names of the East Suburb Forest Park and the South China Botanical Garden, which are under construction, are enough to make people yearn for them. From a drop of water, one can imagine the ocean; from the matter of these trees in Guangzhou, one can also imagine the general progress of construction.

    Before liberation, Guangzhou was a famous consumer city, and industry was just a mess. Therefore, there were particularly many "idlers." In the early days of liberation, this was the city with the highest proportion of unemployed people in the urban population. At that time, many friends from the Northeast said, "Why are there so many idlers in Guangzhou? If a little thing happens on the road, a large group of idlers will immediately gather around to watch for a long time!" Yes, this is precisely a strange characteristic of a consumer city. At that time, there were many poor and destitute people, people walking with birdcages in parks with their legs splayed, people setting up chess games under the arcades to pass the days, people looking for "antiques" in deserted graves and wild ridges, and people wandering around like ghosts. But in ten years, the world has changed. The vast majority of the unemployed are now employed. About 40,000 people, including prostitutes and vagrants, have been transformed into new people. Except for festivals where there are crowds of people everywhere, the number of tourists in the park is sparse at other times. In a word, there are fewer idlers, and a large number of new people are growing up.

    For a city like Guangzhou, eliminating unemployment is like turning the world upside down. The reason why this can be done is because many industries have been established. Listing a string of numbers is not the task of this kind of conversational article. But it is good to write a few numbers. Last year, Guangzhou's total industrial output value was 2.04 billion yuan, and it produced more than 60,000 tons of good steel and miscellaneous steel. From these general figures, people can feel the pulse of the city's industrialization. Now, Guangzhou's heavy machinery factory, steel factory, cement factory, cannery, paper mill, shipyard, cotton mill, sugar mill, as well as the tractor factory, nitrogen fertilizer factory, and chemical factory, which are under accelerated construction, can be said to be quite large in scale, and some are even among the best in the country. Guangzhou has stepped into the historical gate of industrialization.

    The problem of water residents, which has always been a major problem in Guangzhou for hundreds of years, has gradually been resolved. More than 10,000 households of water residents who lived on boats have moved ashore. Last year, on the Mid-Autumn Festival night, we rowed a small boat to the Pearl River to listen to their "Singing on the Water," and in the moonlight and waves, listening to the clear and pleasant songs of the men and women of the water residents, even if the melody was so simple, it really made people feel the heroic feelings of the liberated people.

    In the past ten years, so many new things have emerged! There is no end to it. But I think one thing must be mentioned solemnly. That is, many places of revolutionary significance have been erected with solemn signs or renovated. At the place where the first shot of the Chinese anti-imperialist war was fired, a monument was built on the hills of Sanyuanli. Huanghuagang is managed very neatly, Honghuagang has been opened as a martyrs' cemetery, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and the Peasant Movement Training Institute sponsored by Chairman Mao are decorated like newly built... These places, which international and domestic tourists come to admire, are often crowded with tourists. When Guangzhou's children put on red scarves, they always like to go to the Martyrs' Cemetery to hold a memorial ceremony. This is truly a meaningful thing! Let us tell the people in other places that Guangzhou is protecting these historical relics as if it is protecting its own eyes! They will live forever, just like this vibrant city.

    The beautiful Pearl River runs through this city, flowing day and night, flowing out of Humen, flowing out of the South China Sea. Looking at the flowing water of "Passing away like this, never ceasing," people can't help but ask: What will Guangzhou become in a few years? A journalist drew a picture for us: In three to five years, the east side of Guangzhou will be a light industry and chemical industry zone; the Fangcun area will become a smelting industrial zone; many scientific and cultural institutions will be established in the north as dense as stars; four bridges will span the Pearl River, and west-bound trains will pass over the Pearl River. Ten thousand-ton freighters can be directly berthed at Huangpu. The ring road can directly climb to the top of Baiyun Mountain. ... Guangzhou has undergone countless changes for more than two thousand years, but the new changes of vicissitudes are "still looking at today"!

    This legendary city has a legend: In the past, there was a "divine eye" here. Standing on Baiyun Mountain, he could see the small boats on the Pearl River. Standing on Yuexiu Mountain, he could distinguish whether the pedestrians on the streets of Henan were men or women. If this kind of divine eye still exists, how much I would like to ask him to climb an old tree to take a look! This old tree grows next to the No. 20 wharf on the Pearl River embankment. Its body is still nailed with many rusty iron nails. This was when the British imperialists launched the Opium War more than a hundred years ago. The invading army nailed them to climb the tree to spy on the reality of Guangzhou's defense. We want to ask the Chinese people with divine eyes to climb the tree, look at the sunset in the West, and look at the rising sun in the East, look at the various scenery on both sides of the Pearl River, and look at the myriad styles of this city. Then, loudly tell the people of the West, tell all the descendants of pirates: "This city of ours, which was once riddled with holes, stained with blood, and stamped with your iron hooves, is now as vibrant as a rose! And you, what are you now?"

    飞花点翠绣广州	秦牧
    广州，一提到它的名字，令人有一种遥接万代的感触。想想二千多年前，这里是一个波涛万顷的海滨，人们依山临海建筑了一座小小的“南武城”。而这座城，经过两千多年的沧桑变化，没有湮没，没有荒废，而是一天天扩大起来，大海逐渐退离闹市远去，而它终于成为一座巨大的名城。两千多年来，世界上有多少城市建设起来又毁于兵燹，埋没在风砂中或者沉入海底，毁于地震，在地图上悄悄消失；而我国这座滨海的古老城市，却长远屹立着。这十年来，更加大大地闪耀着光辉。过去，人们一提起广州，就会想到这是一座历史悠久的城市、国际往来极早的城市、亚热带风光洋溢的城市，革命胜迹林立的英雄城市。而现在呢，还应该加上一项：这是一座社会主义的大工业城市！
    这一切色彩强烈的特征交织起来，使广州有多美呵！
    提起这座城市十年来的变化，我想起了巧姑娘们绣花的情景。有些巧姑娘，把个圆圆的“花规子”摆在膝上，刺针飞腾上下，顷刻间花出现了，鸟出现了，亭台楼阁也出现了。人们总爱称赞这些巧手们说：“她们在飞花点翠、描龙绣凤呢！”现在一个个城市也变成了一个个巨大的“花规子”，党领导着劳动人民进行着建设，一会儿这里出现一列工厂了，一会儿那里出现一条街道了，一会儿什么地方又涌出一个公园来了。煞像是奇妙的绣花针儿在顷刻之间绣出来似的。广州是花木特多的城市，它的建设的进展情形特别使我想起了巧姑娘飞花点翠的绝技。
    就拿树木来说吧！这个北回归线亲热地在它北面穿过的亚热带的城市，到处有树有花。夹道的老树很多都是经过百年以上的风霜的。一年四季它们几乎都在开花，木棉、凤凰木开着猩红的花，洋槐树开着鹅黄的花，石栗开着米色的花，紫荆开着紫色的花，玉兰开着冰清玉洁的白色的花……，加上路旁花摊子上五颜六色的花卉，彩色真是瑰丽已极。如今，它更变得到处苍翠欲滴了：这些年里，广州市区增加了几十万株路树，广州郊区更增加了几百万株果树。光说公园吧！新建和扩建的就有十个。这些公园将来各各要具有独特的风格。有的是万紫千红的，有的是古木参天的，有的是南洋风光的。像建设中的东郊森林公园和华南植物公园，那名称就够使人神往了。从一滴水可以想见海洋，从广州这些树木上的事情也可以想见一般建设的进展了。
    广州解放前是一个著名的消费城市，工业只是一些烂摊子。因此，“闲杂人等”特别多。解放初期，这是一个失业者在城市人口中比例最大的城市。当时许多东北来的朋友都说：“广州干吗有这么多的没事人呀？路上发生一丁点儿小事情，马上就有一大群闲人围着瞧半天！”是的，这正是一个消费城市奇怪的特征。那时，穷困潦倒的、托着个鸟笼在公园里踱八字脚的、在骑楼下摆棋局过日子的、在荒坟野岭找“古董”的，以及像游魂似的到处荡来荡去的人多的是。但十年世事一番新，广大的失业者现在基本上都就业了，单是妓女、游民之类被改造成为新人的就约莫有四万人。除了节日到处人山人海外，平时公园里的游客已稀疏起来了。一句话，闲人少了，新人大批地成长了。
    对于广州这样一个城市来说，消灭失业真像是扭转乾坤似的大事。所以能够做到这一步，是因为许多的工业办起来了。列举一串串的数字，不是这样一篇谈天说地的文章的任务。但有几个数字写一写也是好的。去年，广州的工业总产值是二十亿四千万元，一共生产了六万多吨好钢杂钢。从这些概括的数字里面是可以让人感到这个城市工业化的脉搏的吧。现在，广州的重型机器厂、钢铁厂、水泥厂、罐头厂、纸厂、造船厂、棉纺厂、糖厂、以及在加速建设中的拖拉机厂、氮肥厂、化工厂等，可以说都颇具规模，有好些甚至是全国数一数二的，广州已经跨进工业化的历史大门了。
    几百年来一直成为广州重大问题的水上居民的问题，已经逐渐获得了解决。一万多户浮家泛宅的水上居民，已经有五千多户迁到岸上来了。去年中秋夜里我们划着一只小艇到珠江上听他们的“成水歌会”，在月色波光中，听着水上居民男男女女清越愉快的歌声，即使旋律是那么简单吧，也真使人感到翻身的人豪迈的心情了。
    十年来，多少新的事物在涌现呀！这是说不完的。但我觉得有一桩事情还得郑重地提一提。这就是许多有革命纪念意义的地方都树立起庄严的标志或者修葺一新了。响起了中国反帝战争第一声号炮的地方，三元里的山岗上建立了纪念碑，黄花岗管理得异常整洁、红花岗开辟成烈士陵园、中山纪念堂、毛主席主办的农民运动讲习所，整饰得就像新落成似的……，这些国际、国内游客到来都要瞻仰的地方，经常游人如织。广州的少年儿童挂上红领巾时总爱到烈士陵园去举行纪念式。这真是意味深长的事！让我们告诉给其他地方的人们一声吧：广州正像一个人保护着自己的眼睛似的保护着这些历史的遗迹！它们将和这个生气勃勃的城市一样，永远活下去了。
    美丽的珠江穿过这个城市，日夜奔流，流出虎门，流出南海。看着“逝者如斯夫”的流水，人们禁不住会问：若干年后广州将变成怎样呢？新闻记者为我们画下了一幅图画：三五年后，广州东面是轻工业区和化学工业区；芳村区域成为冶炼工业区；北面密如繁星的建立了许多科学文化机构；珠江上面将横跨四座桥梁，西行列车将驶过珠江河面。万吨巨轮可以直泊黄埔。环山公路可以径迈白云山顶。……两千多年来广州有无数的变迁，但新的沧海桑田的变化，却是“还看今朝”呢！
    这座充满了传奇色彩的城市有一个传说：从前，这里出现过一个“神眼”，他站在白云山上能够看清珠江上面的小艇，他站在越秀山上能够分辨河南街道上行人哪一个是男是女。这种神眼要是还有的话，我多么想请他爬上一棵老树上面去瞧瞧呵！这棵老树长在珠江堤岸二十号码头旁边，它的身上还钉着许多生锈的大铁钉，这是一百多年前，英帝国主义掀起鸦片战争的时候，侵略军队钉了爬上树去窥测广州城里防备的虚实的。我们要请中国的具有神眼的人爬上树去，看西方的落日，看东方的朝阳。看珠江两岸的百般风光，看这个城市的万种风貌。然后，大声地告诉西方的人们，告诉一切海盗的子孙们：“我们这个曾经千疮百孔的、饱染鲜血的，印上你们铁蹄的城市，现在正像一朵玫瑰那样的生机勃勃了！而你们，你们现在怎样了呢？”
