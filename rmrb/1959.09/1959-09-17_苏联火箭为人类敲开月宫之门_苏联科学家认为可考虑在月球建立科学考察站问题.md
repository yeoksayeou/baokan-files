Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 16th. The Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket landed between "Sea of Clearness," "Sea of Tranquility," and "Sea of Vapors" according to the original plan. The Kharkov Observatory saw signs of brightness in this area when the rocket reached the moon. This was mentioned by Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Barabashov in an article published in "Labor Daily" today.

Barabashov also said in the article that it is no longer a fantasy for people to fly to the moon, Mars, Venus, and other planets closer to Earth. The successful launch of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket has created possibilities for realizing this fantasy and has accelerated the solution to this problem. He said that it is now necessary to consider the establishment of a scientific research station on the moon in the future. The construction of such a research station will help to study the essence of nuclear reactions and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.

Bazeikin, curator of the Moscow Planetarium, talked about establishing a scientific research station on the moon in an article published in "The Siren" today. He said that the temperature change is small at a depth of a few meters below the surface of the moon. Places such as caves and cracks can be used to build houses for future explorers. At the same time, Bazeikin believes that artificial climate, air conditioning, and lighting devices can be used in these residences to create all the conditions for normal life. Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Academician Walter told a TASS reporter that the establishment of a scientific research station on the moon could determine the nature of radiation belts on Earth or in more distant regions of the universe. He said that due to the lack of atmosphere on the surface of the moon, it provides scientists with a huge, vacuum laboratory where they can conduct experiments on primary cosmic radiation that cannot be carried out on Earth.

Artificial satellites have discovered that there are two radiation belts surrounding the Earth. Scientists have not yet reached a consensus on the origin of these two radiation belts. The particles of radiation have extremely high energy, sometimes millions of times greater than the energy of modern giant accelerators. The composition of the radiation belts directly affects radio communications, especially the navigation of spacecraft. In order to ensure that future space flights do not encounter danger, it is necessary to accurately grasp the relevant information about the radiation intensity of the radiation belts and the space outside the radiation belts.

Soviet astronomer Khistovsky published some details of the second cosmic rocket flight in "Red Star" on the 15th. He said that the cosmic rocket released a sodium cloud when it flew about 150,000 kilometers away from the Earth. He said that in the future, Soviet scientists also plan to create a "tracer" sodium cloud, which will continuously emit such sodium clouds during the rocket's operation, so that its direction of flight can be marked.

He also said that when the rocket flew 66,000 kilometers away from the moon (at which time the gravity of the Earth and the moon were equal), its speed was at least 2.31 kilometers per second. After that, the rocket began to approach the moon at a gradually increasing speed, which reached 3.3 kilometers per second under the action of lunar gravity.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th. TASS Moscow: Professor Dobronravov, a famous Soviet astronautics expert, said that it is certain that Soviet designers have taken the lead in the world in manufacturing the most powerful and most advanced engines used in cosmic rockets.

The scientist said in an article published in "Industrial Economic Daily" today that the successful completion of the major experiment of launching a rocket to the moon shows that Soviet scientists and engineers have reached a new important stage in the study of cosmic space: manufacturing controllable cosmic rockets and launching them into the lunar region along accurately calculated trajectories until they collide with the moon.

Professor Dobronravov believes that the important fact that the Soviet Union can manufacture controllable cosmic rockets can also lead to some other promising developments, especially the complete possibility of manufacturing satellites that can be controlled and returned to Earth in the near future. The scientist wrote that such satellites could carry pilots and scientists to conduct long-range interplanetary flights.

    苏联火箭为人类敲开月宫之门
    苏联科学家认为可考虑在月球建立科学考察站问题
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联第二个宇宙火箭按原定计划降落在“澄海”、“静海”和“汽海”之间。哈尔科夫天文台在火箭到达月球的时候在这一地区看到了光亮的迹象。这是苏联科学院院士巴拉巴绍夫在今天发表在“劳动报”上的一篇文章中谈到的。
    巴拉巴绍夫在文章中还说，人们飞向月球、火星、金星以及其它离地球较近的行星已经不是幻想了，苏联第二个宇宙火箭的成功发射为实现这一幻想创造了可能性，并且加速了这个问题的解决。他说，目前已经有必要考虑一下将来在月球上建立科学考察站的问题，建设这样的考察站将有助于研究核反应的实质，和核能的和平利用问题。
    莫斯科天文馆馆长巴泽金今天在“汽笛报”上发表文章谈到在月球上建立科学考察站说，在月球表面几米以下的深度中，温度变化是较小的，如在洞穴里、裂缝中都可为未来的考察者建立住处。同时，巴泽金认为，在这些住处中可以利用人工气候、空气调节和照明等装置创造一切正常生活的条件。乌克兰科学院院士瓦尔特尔对塔斯社记者说，在月球上建立科学考察站可以确定地球或宇宙间更遥远地区的辐射带的性质问题。他说，由于月球表面缺乏大气，那里就给科学家们提供了一个巨大的、真空的实验室，他们在月球上可以进行在地球上所不能进行的研究原始宇宙辐射线的实验。
    人造卫星已经发现，环绕着地球有两条辐射带，关于这两条辐射带的起源，科学家们还没有一致的意见。辐射线的粒子具有极大的能量，有时，这种能量比现代巨大的加速器的能量还要大数百万倍。辐射带的成份直接影响到无线电通讯，特别是宇宙飞船的航行。为了保证未来的宇宙飞行不会遇到危险，必须精确地掌握有关辐射带的辐射强度和辐射带以外的空间的情况的材料。
    苏联天文学家希斯托夫斯基15日在“红星报”上发表了第二个宇宙火箭飞行的一些详细情况。他说，宇宙火箭是在飞到离地球约十五万公里的时候放出钠云的。他说，今后苏联科学家们还打算制造一种“曳光的”钠云，在火箭运行过程中将接连不断地发射出这种钠云，这样就可以标明它飞行的方向。
    他还说，当火箭飞到离月球六万六千公里时（这时地球和月球的引力相等），它的速度至少有每秒二点三一公里。此后，火箭开始以逐渐增大的速度靠向月球，这个速度在月球引力作用下达到了每秒三点三公里。
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名宇宙航行学专家多勃隆拉沃夫教授说，可以肯定，苏联设计师在制造宇宙火箭所用的最强大和最完善的发动机方面，已在世界上占据领先地位。
    这位科学家今天在“工业经济报”上发表文章说，向月球发射火箭的重大实验的顺利完成表明，苏联科学家和工程师在研究宇宙空间方面达到了新的重要阶段：制造可控制的宇宙火箭，并按照准确计算好的轨道把它们发射到月球区域，直到同月球相碰。
    多勃隆拉沃夫教授认为，苏联能够制造可操纵的宇宙火箭这一重要事实，还可以引起另外一些大有前途的发展，特别是完全可能在不久的将来制造出可以操纵、可以返回地球的卫星。这位科学家写道，这种卫星将可以运载驾驶员和科学工作者去作远程的行星际飞行。
