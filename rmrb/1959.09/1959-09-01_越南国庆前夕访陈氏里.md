　　Visiting Chen Shi Li on the Eve of Vietnamese National Day
　　By our reporter Zhang Kunying
　　One clear afternoon after the rain, on the eve of Vietnamese National Day, we met with Chen Shi Li at the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Hospital. When she learned of our intentions, she warmly asked us to convey her greetings to her Chinese friends who were concerned about her. Then, while showing us the scars on her body, she said that although some wounds were still bleeding, her health had basically recovered.

　　Chen Shi Li said, "When I first entered the hospital, I didn't believe I could survive." Indeed, in the winter of 1958, when she was sent to the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Hospital, she was almost dying. Not only did she not believe she could survive, but everyone who saw her worried about this young life that had suffered serious persecution by the American-Ngo clique.

　　Chen Shi Li is the daughter of a poor peasant from Phu Gang Village, Dien Hong Commune, Dien Ban County, Quang Nam Province, South Vietnam. She is twenty-six years old this year. Since 1948, she has participated in the resistance war, serving as the leader of women's and youth movements in the commune. After the restoration of peace, she continued to participate in the struggle for peace and national reunification. In 1955 and 1956, she was arrested three times by the American-Ngo clique. During her third arrest, she was tortured continuously for more than a month. The American-Ngo clique used "American-style" punishments to cripple her. The jackals stripped her naked, tied her to a wooden board, poured soapy water and dirty water into her mouth and nose, and then took turns trampling on her chest and abdomen, causing blood to gush out of her mouth and nose like a spring. They also cut the flesh on her body with knives and burned her skin with red-hot fire tongs. However, these most brutal tortures did not destroy Chen Shi Li's strong patriotic will. She did not yield under the enemy's knives. After subjecting Chen Shi Li to all kinds of cruelty, the enemy thought she would not survive, so they told her family to take her back and ordered that if she died, she should be buried, and if she lived, she must be sent back. However, people used various methods to protect and save her. After she escaped to the North, she was immediately sent to this well-equipped hospital. Under the care of the great Party, and after months of meticulous treatment by the entire hospital staff, her external injuries have healed eight tenths, and her internal injuries have healed sixty percent. She can not only read newspapers and listen to the radio, but also take walks.

　　Chen Shi Li excitedly told us that in addition to the care she received from the Labor Party and the Vietnamese people, peace-loving people from all over the world were also concerned about her. She received letters from all over the world and gifts from friends in various countries. Many friends from other countries also came to see her in person. We saw various exquisite gifts stored in the glass cabinet in the ward, including portraits of the Chinese heroine Liu Hulan and the Soviet heroine Zoya. These noble friendships strongly supported her, made her feel that the struggle was not isolated, and strengthened her confidence in regaining her health.

　　Recently, the people of North Vietnam have launched a massive protest movement against the brutal "sweeping" operations of the American-Ngo clique in the western region of the South. When she heard the roars of people gathering and marching on the radio, her heart was very excited and indignant. How she wished she could join the ranks of the protest march!

　　Chen Shi Li said that she is writing to the Vietnam International Commission to expose the towering crimes of the American-Ngo clique against the people of South Vietnam. She will use the facts of her personal suffering of various persecutions to show that the various atrocities of the American-Ngo clique against the Phu Loi concentration camp and the people in the western region of the South are absolutely true and brook no denial from the American-Ngo clique.

　　She told us with resentment: "Recently, I heard that my mother was imprisoned by the Ngo Dinh Diem group in Hoi An, and my sister was also arrested." But she firmly stated: "I am not saddened by this. I must more steadfastly recuperate so that I can be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible and work hard for the people. My fate is closely linked to the fate of the people in the South. As long as I have a breath, I must fight on."

　　The meeting time was already quite long, and we said goodbye to Chen Shi Li. She sincerely expressed her gratitude once again for the care of her Chinese friends. She held my hand tightly and said confidently: "My motherland will surely be unified, the struggle of the Vietnamese people will surely be victorious, and the American-Ngo clique will surely suffer a crushing defeat!"

    越南国庆前夕访陈氏里	本报记者　张坤英
    越南国庆前夕的一个雨后晴朗的下午，我们在越苏友谊医院会见了陈氏里。当她知道我们的来意后，就热情地请我们代她向关心她的中国朋友们致意。接着，她一面把身上的伤痕给我们看，一面说：虽然现在有些伤口还在流血，但是，她的健康已经基本恢复了。
    陈氏里说：“在初进医院的时候，我不相信自己还能活下去。”的确，1958年的冬天，当她被送进越苏友谊医院的时候，她几乎是奄奄一息了。不仅她自己不相信她还能活下去，凡是看见她的人，无不为这个遭受美吴集团严重迫害的年轻生命担心。
    陈氏里是南越广南省奠盘县奠鸿乡富钢村一个贫农的女儿，今年二十六岁。从1948年起，她就参加了抗战，担任这个乡的妇女和青运的领导工作。和平恢复后，她继续参加和平和祖国统一的斗争。1955年和1956年，她曾先后三次被美吴集团逮捕。在第三次被捕时，她连续遭到一个多月的拷打。美吴集团用“美国式”的刑罚把她打成残废。豺狼们把她衣服剥光，捆在木板上，用肥皂水和脏水从她的口鼻灌进去，然后轮流在她胸部和腹部踩踏，使血水像泉涌般从口鼻中流出。他们还用刀割她身上的肉，用烧红的火筷烧她的皮肤，但是，这些人间最残暴的酷刑，并没有摧毁陈氏里爱国的坚强意志。她没有在敌人的屠刀下屈服。敌人对陈氏里百般残害之后，满以为她活不成了，就叫她的家人把她领回去，并且命令说，如果她死了就埋掉，活着必须把她再送回来。但是，人们用各种各样的办法掩护和拯救了她。她逃到北方后立即被送进这座设备完善的医院，在伟大的党的关怀下，经过全院医务人员几个月来精心的治疗，现在她的外伤已经好了十分之八，内伤也好了六成，不仅能够读报、听无线电，而且已经能够散步了。
    陈氏里激动地告诉我们，除了劳动党和越南人民对她的关怀之外，世界各国爱好和平的人民都在关怀她。她接到了来自世界各地的信件，收到了各国朋友们送给她的礼物。许多国家的朋友还亲自来看望她。我们看到在病房的玻璃柜里，存放着各种精致的礼品，其中有中国女英雄刘胡兰和苏联女英雄卓娅的画像。这些崇高的友情有力地支持了她，使她感到斗争不是孤立的，加强了她对恢复健康的信心。
    最近，越南北方的人民为反对美吴集团在南部西面地区的残暴“扫荡”，掀起了声势浩大的抗议运动。当她从无线电里听到人们集会、游行发出的怒吼时，她的心非常激动和愤恨。她是多么希望能够参加抗议游行的队伍呀！
    陈氏里说，她正在给越南国际委员会写信，揭露美吴集团对南越人民的滔天罪行。她要用自己亲身遭受各种迫害的事实，说明美吴集团对富利集中营和南部西面地区人民的各种暴行是千真万确的，不容美吴集团丝毫抵赖。
    她愤恨地告诉我们：“最近我听说我的母亲被吴庭艳集团关在会安的监牢里，妹妹也被逮捕了。”但她却坚强地表示：“我并不因此而悲伤，我要更加坚强地安心养病，以便早日出院，努力为人民工作。我的命运是和南方人民的命运紧密联系在一起的，只要我有一口气，我就一定要斗争下去。”
    会见的时间已经不短了，我们向陈氏里告别。她诚挚地再一次表示感谢中国朋友对她的关怀。她紧紧地握着我的手，充满信心地说：“我的祖国一定会统一，越南人民的斗争一定会胜利，美吴集团一定要遭到惨败！”（附图片）
