Congratulatory Message from Comrade Apostolos Grozos, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party and Head of the Greek Communist Party Delegation

Dear Comrades and Friends!

At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we have come to participate in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party has entrusted our delegation to convey to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and to all Chinese Communists and the great Chinese people the warmest congratulations and heartfelt wishes of the Greek Communists and all the democratic people of Greece.

Although our two countries are far apart, common ideals and the desire for freedom, peace, and social progress closely link the people of our two countries. The great achievements made by the heroic Chinese people in the past decade, as well as the brilliant achievements of the great Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries, have made invaluable contributions to establishing lasting world peace and creating the necessary conditions for all countries and peoples (including the Greek people) to move forward along the path of peace, prosperity, and progress. The democratic people of Greece deeply understand this irrefutable fact.

The heroic struggle waged by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, as well as the victorious march of the Chinese people towards the completion of socialist construction, constantly inspires the Greek Communists and the Greek people in their arduous and just struggle for peace, national independence, and democracy.

Dear Comrades and Friends!

Please allow me to read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

      Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party

Dear Comrades!

As the People's Republic of China celebrates its tenth anniversary, the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party extends warm congratulations and heartfelt wishes to you and all the Chinese people.

Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have waged a heroic struggle, which has brought about drastic changes and enormous transformations in your great country. The Greek Communists and all progressive people in our country are deeply admiring and satisfied with these achievements. In the ten years of the people's power, the face of China has changed. The socialist revolution has fundamentally transformed all aspects of social life, economy, and culture, and has made great achievements in establishing the foundations of a socialist society. Advancing shoulder to shoulder and in close cooperation with the great Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries, the Chinese people are creating their own happy future, while transforming their country into an increasingly powerful factor for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The Chinese people have been able to achieve great victories because the Chinese Communist Party has always followed the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in formulating its policies and carrying out its activities, and has creatively applied it to the specific conditions of China, thereby enriching the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism.

The achievements of the Chinese people inspire and strengthen the Greek people's struggle for peace, for the democratic development of Greece, and against the dangerous plans to turn Greece into a nuclear rocket base for foreign imperialists.

Our people thank the Chinese people for supporting the struggle of our democratic forces to defend the life and freedom of our national hero Manolis Glezos and other patriots, and for supporting our people's struggle to repel the terroristic attacks of the reactionary groups and their government and to restore our democratic system and constitution.

The Greek Communists, who have always been learning from the rich experience of the great Chinese Communist Party, wish the Chinese Communists and all the Chinese people, united around the Communist Party and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, new and greater achievements in their noble cause.

Long Live the People's Republic of China!

Long Live the Friendship between the Chinese and Greek People!

Long Live World Peace!

                  Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party

    希腊共产党中央委员会主席、希腊共产党代表团团长
    阿波斯托洛斯·格罗佐斯同志的贺词亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    我们应中国共产党中央委员会的邀请前来参加中华人民共和国成立十周年大庆，希腊共产党中央委员会委托我们代表团向中国共产党中央委员会以及全体中国共产党人和伟大的中国人民转达希腊共产党人和全体希腊的民主人民的最热烈的祝贺和衷心的祝愿。
    虽然我们两国相距很远，然而共同的理想和追求自由、和平和社会进步的愿望把我们两国人民紧密地连结在一起。英勇的中国人民十年来取得的巨大成就，以及伟大的苏联人民和其他社会主义国家人民的辉煌成就，在建立世界持久和平方面、在为各国和各国人民（其中包括希腊人民）沿着和平、繁荣和进步的道路向前迈进创造必要条件方面，作出了不可估价的贡献。希腊的民主人民深深了解这一无可辩驳的事实。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党领导下所进行的英勇斗争以及中国人民为完成社会主义建设的胜利进军，使希腊共产党人和希腊人民在为争取和平、民族独立和民主而进行的艰巨的、正义的斗争中不断得到鼓舞。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    请允许我向中国共产党中央委员会宣读希腊共产党中央委员会的贺电：
      希腊共产党中央委员会贺电亲爱的同志们！
    当中华人民共和国庆祝建国十周年的时候，希腊共产党中央委员会向你们以及全体中国人民致热烈的祝贺和衷心的祝愿。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下进行了英勇的斗争，使你们的伟大国家发生了剧烈的变化并且得到了巨大的改造。希腊共产党人和我国的一切进步人士对这些成就非常钦佩和满意。在人民政权的十年里，中国的面貌改变了。社会主义革命根本改造了社会生活、经济和文化的各个方面，在建立社会主义社会的基础方面取得了巨大的成就。中国人民同伟大的苏联人民和其他社会主义各国人民并肩前进，亲密合作，创造着自己的幸福的未来，同时把自己的国家变成和平、民主和社会主义的日益强大的因素。
    中国人民所以能取得伟大的胜利，是因为中国共产党在制定自己的政策和进行活动时一向遵循着马克思列宁主义学说并把它创造性地运用于中国的具体条件，从而丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。
    中国人民的成就鼓舞并加强了希腊人民为争取和平、争取希腊的民主发展，为反对把希腊变为外国帝国主义者的原子火箭基地的危险计划而进行的斗争。
    我国人民感谢中国人民支持我国民主力量为维护民族英雄曼诺里斯·格列索斯和其他爱国者的生命和自由而进行的斗争，感谢中国人民支持我国人民为击退反动集团和它们的政府的恐怖进攻，为恢复我国的民主制度和宪法而进行的斗争。
    一向都在学习伟大中国共产党的丰富经验的希腊共产党人，祝中国共产党人以及团结在共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会周围的全体中国人民在他们的崇高的事业中获得新的更加伟大的成就。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国和希腊人民的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
                  希腊共产党中央委员会（阿·格罗佐斯签字）（附图片）
