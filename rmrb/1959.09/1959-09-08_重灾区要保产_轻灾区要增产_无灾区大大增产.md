Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th. After studying and discussing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of people's commune members in rural Sichuan responded to the call of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to "ensure production in heavily afflicted areas, increase production in lightly afflicted areas, and greatly increase production in basically disaster-free areas," and launched a new high tide of production competition. Millions of farmers have made guarantees to the Party: to fight hard in September, vow to win a bumper harvest, fight drought to the end, and welcome National Day. Now, the entire countryside has been boiling, and everywhere is a scene of bustling activity.

The struggle against drought in rural Sichuan, which has lasted for more than two months, has achieved great victories, but the drought has not been completely eliminated. Since late August, the drought has resurfaced in some areas, and the number of severely drought-stricken areas has risen from the previous decline to more than ten counties to more than forty counties. The publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has greatly increased the fighting spirit of the people in the disaster areas, and they are determined to respond to the call of the Party with practical actions of fighting drought to the end and striving for a bumper harvest. Mianyang County, which has overcome the invasion of severe drought and floods and recently experienced new drought conditions, was the first to issue a challenge to all heavily afflicted areas in the province, guaranteeing to increase production even in heavy disaster areas and transform disaster years into bumper years. The competition conditions in this county are: this year's total grain output should increase by 15.5% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; cotton and oil crops should also increase production compared with last year. The main measures they have taken, in addition to fighting drought to the end, are to harvest 350,000 mu of mid-season rice well, increasing the yield by 15 jin per mu through careful harvesting; to vigorously grasp the field management of sweet potatoes, late rice, and late corn, etc., to apply two to three more fertilizers to sweet potatoes, and to promptly lift vines and weed, striving to increase production by 500 to 1,000 jin per mu; to carefully manage the more than 90,000 mu of radishes and more than 20,000 mu of vegetables that have been planted, striving to harvest more than 4,000 jin of radishes per mu; and to strive to harvest 10,000 jin of vegetables per mu. In order to ensure the realization of the above-mentioned competition conditions, the county is vigorously publicizing and studying the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, striving to make it known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, thereby greatly breaking down the slack and fearful emotions such as "theory of fixed outcome" and "theory of sole reliance on conditions," and further strengthening the idea of "man can conquer nature" and continuous revolution. At present, the people of the county have been fully mobilized, and more than 90% of the elite troops have been put into the front line. Command posts have been established at the county, district, and commune levels, led by the first secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, and all have moved to the fields to work and fight alongside the masses.

The "no reduction in production in heavy disaster areas" competition initiated by Mianyang County was immediately warmly responded to by the people of heavy disaster areas such as Dazhu and Fengjie. More than 30,000 people in Dazhu County shouted slogans at the county-wide radio mobilization meeting: "Wherever the Party points, we will rush there," "We are determined to carry the struggle against drought to the end." This county, which had not rained for more than 60 days and the drought has not yet been eliminated, is determined to increase production by 7% compared to last year. After the mobilization meeting, the people of the county immediately took action. Ma Jiazhen, the director of the Dashi Management Area of Miaoba Commune and a Communist Party member, took the lead in carrying water to irrigate the drought-stricken late autumn crops. When his shoulders were worn out and others advised him to rest, he refused, saying: A baby cannot leave its mother, and crops cannot leave water. As long as everyone works hard, we will definitely be able to realize the call of the Party and Chairman Mao. His exemplary action inspired more than 100 commune members to run to places five miles away to carry water to irrigate crops, irrigating more than 150 mu in one day and one night.

The first to initiate the "increase production in light disaster areas" competition was the people of Nanjiang County, the old revolutionary base area. Although this county has suffered three droughts, one level 8 gale, and several pests and diseases, the broad masses believe in the discussion and analysis that: the spring crops this year increased by 5% compared to last year; the sown area of ​​major spring crops such as rice and sweet potatoes increased by 23% compared to last year; the recently increased late autumn crops exceeded the spring sowing area; the temperature after "Autumn Begins" is higher than in previous years, which is a great time for late autumn crops to grow. Therefore, the current situation is very favorable, and increasing production is promising. Based on this, they proposed a leap forward target of increasing total grain output by 50% compared to last year, and launched a "increase production in light disaster areas" competition to light disaster areas. Now, this competition craze has swept through counties such as Nanchuan, Langzhong, and Pingchang. In the three days after studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the people of Langzhong County put forward more than 210,000 suggestions related to increasing production, and are determined to overfulfill various production tasks. In the struggle against drought and management of late autumn, thirty-five communes such as Shuangfeng, Leishan, and Hongqi have seen a surge of team-to-team, field-to-field, and person-to-person competition, making 175,000 mu of late autumn crops reach full seedlings and grow well.

"'On the basis of the original plan to increase the total grain output by 100 million jin compared with last year, increase it by another 200 million jin'," this is the competition condition proposed by Rong County to disaster-free areas throughout the province. The 580,000 mu of wheat, early rice, mid-season rice, corn, etc. that have been harvested in this county have already increased a large amount of grain compared to last year. In order to achieve this leap forward target, various communes have held tens of thousands of oath-taking rallies, and 20,000 rural cadres led 300,000 labor armies, adopting a combination of mass assault and fixed special management, to do a good job in topdressing, cultivating, and pest control. Recently, the late autumn crops sown in the county have been expanded from the original 30,000 mu to 140,000 mu. In nine days, commune members throughout the county have generally fertilized, cultivated, and weeded more than 400,000 mu of late rice, 260,000 mu of sweet potatoes, and 90,000 mu of cotton. In the Wenjiang Special Zone located in the Dujiangyan irrigation area, the "disaster-free large overproduction" competition is in full swing. The wheat production in this special zone increased by 44% this year, and the mid-season rice also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the people of various counties greatly broke down the complacency and slack emotions of a few cadres, and have been mobilizing troops and adding measures for days, deciding to make full use of the favorable conditions of being disaster-free and having few disasters, to overproduce and overproduce again. Now, the plains are crowded with people, rushing to harvest mid-season rice during the day and engaging in large-scale increased planting at night. After the late autumn crops that have been increased and planted throughout the region are harvested, if calculated on a per capita basis, each person can get more than 200 jin of raw grain.

### 重灾区要保产  轻灾区要增产  无灾区大大增产

    新的竞赛热潮遍及四川农村
    重灾区要保产  轻灾区要增产  无灾区大大增产
    新的竞赛发起者的宏图大志：
    重灾区绵阳县：保证灾年变丰年，粮食增产一成半
    轻灾区南江县：战胜轻灾夺丰产，力争粮食增五成
    无灾区荣　县：原定增产一亿斤，再要增产二亿斤
    新华社成都7日电　四川农村广大人民公社社员在学习和讨论了党的八届八中全会的决议后，响应中共四川省委提出的“重灾区要保产，轻灾区要增产，基本无灾区要大大增产”的号召，掀起了新的生产竞赛高潮。千百万农民向党提出保证：要大战9月，誓夺丰收，抗旱到底，迎接国庆。现在，整个农村已经沸腾起来，到处都是一片繁忙的景象。
    四川农村持续了二个多月的抗旱斗争，虽已取得巨大胜利，但旱象迄未完全解除，8月下旬以来，部分地区旱象又重新抬头，严重受旱地区由过去已下降到十多个县又上升到四十多个县。党的八届八中全会公报和决议的公布，使灾区人民斗志倍增，决心用抗旱到底、力争丰收的实际行动，响应党的号召。战胜特大旱涝侵袭，最近又有新旱象发生的绵阳县，首先向全省各重灾区发出战表，保证做到重灾也增产、灾年变丰年。这个县的竞赛条件是：今年粮食总产量要比大跃进的1958年增长15.5％；棉花和油料作物也要比去年增产。他们采取的主要措施，除了抗旱到底之外，要收好三十五万亩中稻，每亩从精打细收中增收十五斤粮食；大抓甘薯和晚稻、晚玉米等田间管理，要给甘薯多追二至三次肥，并及时提藤、除草，争取每亩多增产五百至一千斤；对已种下去的九万多亩萝卜和两万多亩蔬菜认真管好，力争每亩萝卜收到四千斤以上；每亩蔬菜争取收到万斤。为了保证上述竞赛条件的实现，全县正大张旗鼓宣传和学习党的八届八中全会公报和决议，力争做到家喻户晓、深入人心，从而大破“定局论”和“唯条件论”等松劲畏难情绪，进一步坚定“人定胜天”和不断革命的思想。现今，全县人民已经总动员，90％以上的精兵都投入第一线。县、区、公社层层建立了指挥部，由各级党委第一书记挂帅，并全部搬到田间办公，和群众一道战斗。
    绵阳县发起的“重灾不减产”竞赛，立即得到大竹、奉节等重灾区人民的热烈响应。大竹县三万多人在全县广播动员大会上振臂高呼：“党指向那里，就奔向那里”，“坚决把抗旱斗争进行到底”。这个曾经六十多天没有下雨，旱象至今尚未解除的县份，决心要比去年增产7％。动员会后，全县人民立即行动起来。庙坝公社大石管理区主任、共产党员马家珍，带头挑水浇灌受旱的晚秋作物，当他的肩头磨肿别人劝他休息时，他拒绝说：奶娃离不开娘，庄稼离不开水，只要人人加劲干，一定能实现党和毛主席的号召。他的模范行动，鼓舞了一百多个社员跑到五里路外的地方挑水浇灌庄稼，一天一夜就浇了一百五十多亩。
    首先发起“轻灾要增产”竞赛的，是革命老根据地南江县人民。这个县虽然先后受过三次干旱、一次八级大风和几种病虫害的袭击，但广大群众在讨论分析中认为：今年小春作物比去年增产5％；水稻、甘薯等大春作物播种面积比去年扩大23％，最近增种的晚秋作物，超过了小春种植面积，“立秋”后的气温比往年高，正是晚秋作物生长的大好时机，因此，当前形势十分有利，增产大有可为。据此，他们提出今年粮食总产量要比去年增加50％的跃进指标，向轻灾区发起了“轻灾要增产”的竞赛。现在，这个竞赛热潮已经席卷南川、阆中、平昌等县。阆中县人民在学习了八中全会决议后的三天中，提出有关增产的建议二十一万多件，决心超额完成各项生产任务。双凤、雷山、红旗等三十五个公社在抗旱和管理晚秋中，出现了队队竞赛、田田竞赛、人人竞赛的热潮，使十七万五千多亩晚秋作物达到全苗，生长良好。
    “全年粮食总产量在原定比去年增产一亿斤的基础上，再多增产二亿斤”，这是荣县向全省无灾区提出的竞赛条件。这个县已收的五十八万亩小麦、早稻、中稻、玉米等已经比去年增产了大量粮食，为了实现这一跃进指标，各个公社都举行了万人誓师大会，两万名农村干部率领三十万劳动大军，采取群众突击和固定专人管理相结合的办法，做好追肥、中耕、治虫等工作。最近，全县播种的晚秋作物，已由原来的三万亩扩大到十四万亩，在九天中，全县社员对四十多万亩晚稻、二十六万亩甘薯、九万亩棉花普遍进行了施肥和中耕除草。位于都江堰流域的温江专区，“无灾大超产”的竞赛，正搞得热火朝天。这个专区今年小麦增产44％，中稻又获得空前大丰收，各县人民学习了八中全会的决议后，大破少数干部的自满松劲情绪，连日调兵遣将，增添措施，决定充分利用无灾和少灾的有利条件，超产再超产，现在千里平原上到处人山人海，白天抢收中稻，晚上大搞增种。全区已经增种的晚秋作物收获以后，如按人口平均计算，每人可得原粮二百多斤。（附图片）
