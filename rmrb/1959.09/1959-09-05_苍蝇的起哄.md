When flies discover a little bit of mud on a soldier, they become smug, attacking the single spot as a pack, buzzing with excitement: so, soldiers have flaws too, they're dirty, thank God, amen!

For flies, this is fulfilling their instinct, "exhausting their heavenly duty."

As for the soldier, whether they are smug or buzzing excitedly, it does not diminish their glory one bit. Since they are soldiers, and in battle, it is unavoidable to get some mud on them, to get a little dirty. Mud can be washed off; dirt can be disinfected; dedicating all efforts to victory, advancing bravely regardless of all difficulties, this is the true color of a soldier. A little mud and grime cannot make the soldier inferior, and the soldier feels no guilt about it.

Imperialists and colonialists are precisely the flies that feed on human poverty and find pleasure in human wars and deaths. Toward us, the soldiers who dedicate ourselves to the ideals of socialism and communism, facing our magnificent spirit of fighting to improve China's poor and blank state, facing our Great Leap Forward of working diligently day and night for a better life, facing our people's communes that pave the way for accelerating the advance towards socialism and the transition to communism, they naturally cannot avoid buzzing with excitement and humming.

Before his death, Dulles made six vicious curses against our Great Leap Forward and people's communes in less than three months, from November 13th of last year to February 3rd of this year. The humming sound was loud enough. However, that man has already fallen, died; while our people's communes are thriving, our Great Leap Forward is still moving forward, and our Party's General Line is shining even more brilliantly. How have these been diminished in the slightest by the flies' slander? All those fly-like people still alive, I wonder if they will be disheartened by the futility of their predecessors?

However, flies take it as their "heavenly duty" to buzz around the mud on soldiers. Even if they can't find a single bit of mud, they won't give up; and when they actually find a little bit of mud on the soldier – even if it's just a little bit – they can't help but be smug, attacking the single spot as a pack, buzzing with excitement: China is encountering "difficulties," facing "the darkest year," in "full retreat," we are spared the threat of the "giant dragon." Thank God, amen.

In fact, even if they prayed to God, it would not help the flies. Dreaming that a little bit of mud on the soldier will immediately turn into a body full of sores, God is powerless to fulfill this vicious wish. The Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the new development of the increase production and practice economy movement precisely show that our revolutionary cause has not been "frustrated," but is moving forward better. The light of the General Line has not diminished, but shines more brightly; the momentum of the Great Leap Forward has not declined, but is even more like ten thousand horses galloping; the superiority of the people's communes has not been damaged, but has been better developed. It is precisely those buzzing flies that have truly suffered "setbacks." While shouting "the figures are still unreliable," they cannot help but admit: "The stark reality is: in both food and industry, China is still far ahead." (August 30th, British "Reynolds News")

The soldiers of socialist construction in New China are singing the magnificent march of Long Live the General Line, Long Live the Great Leap Forward, Long Live the People's Communes, marching forward in great strides, "far ahead." As for the flies? One day, they will be exterminated under the people's fly swatters.

### 苍蝇的起哄

    苍蝇的起哄
    章沛
    当苍蝇发现战士身上沾上了一点点泥巴之后，就得意洋洋，群起攻其一点，纷然起哄：原来战士也有缺点的，他肮脏了，谢谢上帝，阿门！
    对于苍蝇来说，这是发挥它们的本能，“厥尽天职”。
    至于对于战士，得意洋洋也罢，纷然起哄也罢，并无损于他光辉的分毫。既然是战士，又在战斗，沾上些泥巴，染上些肮脏，也就在所难免。对于泥巴，可以洗净；对于肮脏，可以消毒；倾注全力于胜利，不顾一切困难而奋勇前进，这是战士的本色。些小泥巴和污垢，既不能使战士逊色，战士对此更无愧于心。
    帝国主义者、殖民主义者，就正是以人类的贫困为食料，以人类的战争和死亡为乐园的苍蝇。它们，对于我们这些为社会主义、共产主义的理想而献身的战士，面对着我们为改善中国一穷二白的状况而奋战的磅礴气概，面对着我们为美好生活而日夜辛勤的大跃进，面对着我们为加速向社会主义前进和为向共产主义过渡铺好道路的人民公社，也就自然免不了纷然起哄，嗡嗡而鸣。
    杜勒斯在临终之前，就曾经在去年11月13日到今年2月3日不到三个月时间内，对我国的大跃进和人民公社连续作了六次恶毒的诅咒。嗡嗡的鸣声是够响亮的。但是，如今那人已是倒也，死也；而我们的人民公社却在蒸蒸日上，我们的大跃进还在继续向前，我们党的总路线愈发光芒万丈。这些又何曾因了苍蝇的点污而丝毫逊色呢？一切还在世的苍蝇式的人们，不知可会因前辈的徒劳而寒心？
    然而，苍蝇以围绕战士身上的泥巴起哄为“天职”。即使找不到一点泥巴时，它们也不会罢休；而当它们居然能在战士身上找到一点点泥巴——那怕只是一点点——之后，就更不免要得意洋洋，群起攻其一点，纷然起哄：中国遇到“困难”了，面临“最暗淡的一年”了，“全线退却”了，我们免除了“巨龙”的威胁了。谢谢上帝，阿门。
    其实，即使祈祷了上帝，对于苍蝇们也是于事无补的。梦想战士身上的一点点泥巴，会马上变成满身疮疡，这种恶毒愿望，上帝也无能为力。中共八届八中全会的公报和增产节约运动的新开展，正好说明了，我们的革命事业不是“挫折”了，而是更好的前进着。总路线的光芒，没有收敛，而是更灿烂地照射；大跃进的气势，没有衰退，而是更加万马奔腾；人民公社的优越性，没有损害，而是更好地发扬了。真正受到“挫折”的，倒正是那些起哄的苍蝇们。在叫嚣“数字仍不可靠”等等之余，不免仍要承认：“冷酷的现实是：在粮食以及在工业方面，中国仍然遥遥领先。”（8月30日英国“雷诺新闻”）
    新中国社会主义建设的战士们，正高歌总路线万岁、大跃进万岁、人民公社万岁的雄伟的进行曲，“遥遥领先”地大步迈进。至于苍蝇呢？总有一天，会在人民的蝇拍底下绝种的。
