    The First Day Welcoming Spectators

    September 4th was a grand festival for the newly completed Beijing Workers' Stadium. This, the largest stadium in our country at present, was to officially receive spectators on this day. Two football matches of the National Games were to be held here.

    On the eve of September 4th, it was already late at night, but the electric bulletin board composed of over 20,000 electric lights on the central sports field continued to emit light, like stars twinkling in the sky. Workers were conducting final tests. Inside the stadium, workers repeatedly compacted the running track. Other staff members of the stadium worked tirelessly through the night, making final preparations, welcoming the arrival of this day with festive joy, forgetting themselves in labor.

    At dawn, at the entrance of the magnificent stadium, ten large red flags fluttered in the wind, shining brightly in contrast with the green flags bearing the image of peace doves.

    Long before the start of the competition, people were already flocking to the stadium from all directions. People happily toured the premises, some carefully examining the sculptures, others running to the top of the fifty-six-step grandstand, gazing far into the distance at the scenery of Beijing. A melodious waltz played softly within the stadium, and some young men excitedly danced to the rhythm.

    Among the crowd were two old workers, strolling around admiring the stadium's architecture while discussing with great interest who would win the National Games football final in the afternoon. They were two of the 30,000 construction workers invited to watch the game. It was these workers who had built this magnificent building with their own hands. Old worker Yang Sheng-yi said that their group had just held a small meeting and decided to voluntarily dedicate their spare time to work, to make up for the work hours spent watching the game. He said, "If we enjoy the game at the expense of the country's losses, how can that be allowed!"

    More and more people arrived, and upon reaching here, they were attracted by the magnificent stadium and entered the twenty-four grandstands one after another. Some sat low, some went straight to the high places, but regardless of where they were, they could see clearly.

    The athletes entered the field, the Heilongjiang team in red, the Jilin team in white. They were the first football teams to officially compete in this stadium, and the tense match quickly attracted the audience. A burst of thunderous applause rang out in the stadium as the Jilin team kicked a goal into the opponent's net, opening the scoring. The clock beside the electric bulletin board pointed to 2:50 PM, and the huge numbers "1" to "0" appeared before the audience. People's attention then turned to this beautiful building.

    While the football match inside the central sports field was in full swing, some athletes were also working hard in the two track and field fields outside. More than a thousand of the nation's best track and field athletes have gathered here, waiting for the competition. The Shanghai and Inner Mongolia teams, which only arrived in the capital on the evening of September 3rd, began intense practice the following afternoon. The Guizhou team, which arrived earliest, had marathon runners Zhang Changxue and Zhang Shiqing preparing to reach the level of Master Athlete at the National Games. Ren Zhende, a Six-Good Red Flag shock worker from a poor peasant family, wants to use her strong will to create good results in the 5,000-meter long-distance race at the National Games.

    People's attention was soon drawn to the rippling swimming pool. It was surrounded by dense crowds of spectators. In September in Beijing, the weather was already cool, but there were still many people swimming and frolicking. Many of the spectators were residents of the nearby Workers' Happiness Village, who had a special fondness for the swimming pool, because just over a year ago, this place was still a reed field and a sewage pond!

    The sun was already setting in the west, and a burst of warm applause rang out in the stadium as the second football match—the Hebei team versus the People's Liberation Army team—began. Staff members of the television station and radio station were busy broadcasting the exciting game to every corner.

    The game ended at 6:20 PM, and tens of thousands of spectators quickly left the stadium. The police inside and outside the stadium were busy, and countless buses were already waiting for passengers there. People discussed the game while constantly praising this stadium designed by our own country. The excited mood of the people lingered for a long time. People living in Beijing remember that before liberation, Beijing only had the Temple of Agriculture Stadium, where weeds grew as tall as people, while today Beijing already has fourteen relatively large public stadiums.

    迎接观众的第一天
    9月4日，对刚落成的北京工人体育场来说，是一个隆重的节日。这个我国目前最大的体育场，这一天要正式接待观众。全运会的两场足球赛要在这里举行。
    9月4日前夕，夜已经很深，可是中心运动场上用二万多个电灯组成的电动公告牌仍不时发出亮光，像是天上的星星在闪烁。工人们正在进行最后的试验。场内，工人们一遍又一遍地在整压跑道。体育场的其他工作人员都彻夜在进行各项最后准备工作，他们怀着节日的喜悦，忘我地劳动，迎接这个日子的来临。
    黎明，雄伟的体育场的入口处，十面大红旗迎风招展，同画着和平鸽的绿旗相映生辉。
    离开始比赛还有好长时间，可是人们已从四面八方陆续涌向体育场。人们兴高采烈地各处参观，有的在仔细端详雕塑像，有的跑到五十六级高的看台的顶处，极目远眺北京城的景色。场内悠扬地响起了悦耳的华尔兹舞曲，有些小伙子兴奋得随着节奏旋舞起来。
    人群中有两个老工人，一边漫步参观体育场的建筑，一边津津有味地议论着下午全运会足球决赛将谁胜谁负。他们是被邀请来看球赛的三万名建筑工人中的两个。就是这些工人，曾经用自己的双手建造起这座雄伟的建筑物。老工人杨盛义说，他们小组刚开了小会，决定自动抽出业余时间来干点活，弥补由于看球而花去的工时。他说：“顾了看球，要国家受损失，那怎么行！”
    人越来越多，人们一到这里，就被雄伟的体育场吸引住了，他们陆续进入了二十四个看台。有的坐在低处，有的直奔高处，不管在哪里都同样看得很清楚。
    运动员入场了，穿红色的是黑龙江队，穿白色的是吉林队。他们是第一个在这个体育场正式比赛的足球队，紧张的球赛很快吸引住了观众。场上一阵雷动的掌声，吉林队已经踢进对方球门一球，首开纪录。电动公告牌旁的时钟正指在两点五十分，“1”比“○”的巨大字样随着出现在观众的面前。人们的注意力这时又转向了这个漂亮的建筑物。
    中心运动场内的足球赛鏖战正酣，场外的两个田径场上，一些运动员也正在发奋苦练。目前全国最优秀的一千多名田径选手已云集在这里，等待比赛。9月3日晚上才到首都的上海队和内蒙古队，第二天下午就开始了紧张的练习。到得最早的贵州队中，马拉松赛跑运动员章昌学和张世清准备在全运会上争取达到健将水平。贫农出身的六好红旗突击手任贞德，想在全运会的五千米长跑比赛中以坚强的意志创造良好成绩。
    人们的注意很快又被那碧波荡漾的游泳池所吸引。那里围着密密层层的观众。9月的北京，天气已有凉意，但仍有许多人在泅泳游嬉，参观的人群中有许多是附近工人幸福村中的居民，他们对游泳池怀着特别的好感，因为一年多以前这里还是一片芦苇和污水塘呢！
    太阳已经西斜，场内响起了一阵热烈的掌声，第二场足球赛——河北队对解放军队的比赛开始了。电视台和广播台的工作人员都忙碌起来，他们把这场精彩的球赛的情况转播到各个角落。
    球赛结束，已是下午六点二十分，几万观众很快就退出了体育场。场内外的民警忙了起来，无数辆公共汽车已在那里等待乘客了。人们一面议论着球赛，一面还不断赞美这座由我国自己设计出来的体育场。人们激动的心情，久久不能平复。住在北京的人都记得，解放前的北京只有先农坛一个体育场，那里野草长得像人一般高，而今天的北京已经拥有十四座比较大的公共体育场了。
