Column: Ode to the Decade

    In the past ten years, the capital has changed dramatically, even I, a Beijing native, dare not boast of being familiar with Beijing. Indeed, I haven't walked many new streets, and many old streets have changed their appearance. If I barely recognize the streets, how can I claim to be familiar with Beijing?
    Truly, to explain the changes in Beijing over the past decade in detail, one would have to write a thick book. And no one can write such a book, because no one knows enough to comprehensively introduce everything. Just the construction of water and sewage systems is enough for an expert to write a book on; isn't it?
    I think it's best if I talk about everyday family matters. I have many relatives and friends who have lived in Beijing for a long time, and if their living habits have changed, it's enough to prove that their thoughts and feelings have also changed. In other words, they have received revolutionary education.
    Do you think swatting flies is a simple matter? It's not simple at all! Take Aunt Wang for example. In the past, she had to burn incense to the God of Wealth and the Kitchen God every day, eat vegetarian food on the first and fifteenth of each month, and wouldn't bear to kill a bedbug or step on an ant. Do you think she would be willing to swat flies? But now, she actively participates in the neighborhood's work to eliminate the four pests, attacking flies and mosquitoes at all times.
    Aunt Wang has changed. She understands the importance of cleanliness and hygiene, and knows that flies are bad things that can take her life. If she doesn't take action herself to eliminate flies, the flies will eliminate her. She no longer kowtows and prays to the gods, but picks up a fly swatter. This is no small change! Aunt Wang has probably leapt forward more than a hundred years in her thinking! If she still believed that because she offended the flies, the King of Hell might condemn her to be reincarnated as a kitten or puppy in her next life, how could she righteously strive to be a model fly swatter? No, she doesn't believe in that old stuff anymore. She has given up the method of accumulating merit and seeking blessings only for herself, and replaced it with doing things that are beneficial to others and also beneficial to herself. This is no simple matter! She has changed like this because she encountered socialism. Only socialism can make Aunt Wang leap forward by more than a century!
    Let's look at Aunt Li. She doesn't believe that flies can go to the King of Hell to complain after they die, but she believes in "no dirt, no cleanliness, no disease." She thinks swatting flies is unnecessary. But recently, she actually started a competition with Aunt Wang to see who would get the hygiene red flag first. Her "no dirt, no cleanliness" theory was thoroughly refuted by higher theory and practice. She demands that her body and mind be equally clean, and cannot lag behind Aunt Wang. Of course, Aunt Wang has done a considerable job in persuading Aunt Li.
    There are many Aunt Wangs and Aunt Lis on every street, so Beijing has basically eliminated flies. Of course, Uncle Wang and Uncle Li, and Sister Wang and Miss Li didn't stand idly by either. All the people of Beijing have been educated by the sanitation campaign, and all the streets and alleys of Beijing have become clean. This is truly a matter of changing customs and habits.
    The above is just one example of changing customs and habits. There are many other examples.
    A few days ago, I saw a cyclist almost hit a little girl. The little girl dodged, but the tofu she was holding in her hand fell to the ground. The cyclist stopped, and the little girl also stopped, and neither of them said anything. A person standing by the roadside pointed at them, without saying a word. The cyclist moved closer to the side of the road, and the little girl followed. The person by the roadside looked at her, made sure she wasn't hit, and then pointed to the tofu on the ground. The cyclist took out a dime, gave it to the little girl, smiled, and got on his bike. The little girl nodded to the person by the roadside and turned to buy more tofu. The person by the roadside was still standing there, perhaps waiting for someone.
    Socialism creates heroes. New heroes and heroic deeds appear every day and everywhere. There are no heroes in the little story mentioned above, where the problem was solved without a word. But even such a small thing could only happen today. If you don't believe me, I can rearrange this event according to the rules of the old society: as soon as the little girl saw the tofu fall on the ground, she would definitely cry loudly. The cyclist, in all likelihood, would speed up and ride away. If he couldn't get away easily, he would yell and scream, putting all the blame on the little girl. Then, many people would gather around, watching the excitement with their hands in their sleeves. By the time the "audience" had increased to the point where they filled the road and blocked traffic, the police would arrive late. The problem still couldn't be solved. Until the little girl's parents came, everyone would go to the police station, followed by a crowd of "spectators."
    I have no intention of exaggerating. In the old society, I could see similar things every day. Now, the little girl knows for sure that someone will speak up for her, so why should she cry? The cyclist knows for sure that even if he doesn't hit a person, but hits tofu, he must stop and apologize. The person by the roadside knows for sure that he must help the little girl, and will not attract trouble for doing so; today, there will absolutely be no burying the funeral procession in the cemetery. Thanks to the education of the Party, the social atmosphere has changed.
    In the past ten years, there have been fewer and fewer fights on the streets, fewer people causing trouble while drunk, and fewer people swaggering through the city. Our streets are clean, and the people's behavior and speech are also clean. This makes me love Beijing even more. Before liberation, I made a living in all directions, always thinking of Beijing, but also afraid to come back. Every time I returned to Beijing, I would go to see a play or stroll in the park, and I would get a bellyful of anger. In the theater, just like on the tram, those without tickets were all majestic, while those with tickets deserved to be bullied. Not to mention being beaten and scolded myself, just watching that scene would make my heart feel blocked – why is everything so unreasonable! How much I love Beijing, but should Beijing be like this? Therefore, every time I came back, I was sure to be heartbroken!
    Now, every time I walk on the street, I always feel more joy. Whether I go to get a haircut, take a bath, or buy something, I am always met with many smiling faces, just like being at home. If smiling faces and polite words are just routine formalities, then they are hypocritical and worthless. No, it's not like that. Everyone is sincere in their hearts and expresses it outwardly, and they truly want to serve others from the bottom of their hearts. Everyone's smile is a flower of the heart cultivated by socialist education, not a forced pretense. Yes, it makes people feel like they are sitting in the spring breeze everywhere, and they not only feel warmth in their hearts, but also constantly increase their love for socialism and their gratitude to the Party!
    The relationship between people has undergone great changes. After a waiter serves me enthusiastically, I can't help but want to serve him in return. I can't sell things or cut hair, but I also have my work. I want to do my work well as a reward to the waiters. I am like this personally, and I think everyone in the whole society feels the same way. Otherwise, how could Beijing have undergone such great changes in just ten years?
    Since the relationship between people has changed, people's useless burdens have been greatly reduced, and they can concentrate their energy on meaningful things. Think about it, in the families of the old society, how many rules there were! Not to mention encountering weddings and funerals, which would cause chaos and even bankruptcy, even in ordinary times, there were often endless quarrels between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, fathers and sons, due to minor breaches of etiquette. Today, everyone strives to go out and do something, and the relationship between people is no longer bound by hypocritical rules, but is encouraged by new social mores, and everyone strives to do their best to serve society. Not to mention young men and women, even the elderly are unwilling to be completely idle. Yes, aren't Aunt Wang and Aunt Li doing their best in street work? In this way, everyone has a deeper understanding of life, and wants to live more meaningfully and more valuable lives. The eyes of men, women, old and young, are no longer focused only on their own homes, but see the whole alley, the whole of Beijing, and even the whole country. If the eyes see far, the heart will naturally be bright, and they will no longer make trouble over those trivial rules. As a result, the family becomes more harmonious, the neighborhood becomes more intimate, and the large courtyards that were once considered backward have become model courtyards with red flags flying high. Isn't loving and helping each other the greatest happiness?
    Yes, in this happy environment, being idle is very disgraceful. From the time I can remember until before liberation, many Beijingers took pride in being idle. In their eyes, the better off someone was, the less work they did. Of course, their hands couldn't be idle forever. They would play cards and put delicious things in their mouths. The meaning of their lives was to kill time. Their one day was equal to twenty years, just being idle and doing nothing. They didn't create history, but waited for history to end them. From their one day being equal to twenty years to our one day being equal to twenty years, what a great change!
    Labor is glorious has replaced leisure is honorable. Only in this way can the whole of Beijing be as close as one family. No one is high, no one is low, and those who are willing to work are brothers and sisters. Everyone seems to feel that I am Beijing, and Beijing is also mine. I respect everyone who is willing to work, and everyone who works also respects me, as long as I am not idle. What a beautiful sight! Everyone is a comrade, a friend, and there is no need to have met before, just reach out and shake hands warmly. What a gratifying and lovely phenomenon!
    Although I was born in Beijing and love Beijing, ten years ago I sometimes felt that this love was subjective and not necessarily right. Now, every time I walk on the street, I seem to touch the true meaning of life: yes, people should live like this, everyone is equal, everyone is free, and use labor and wisdom to create their own and everyone's happiness, so that tomorrow is happier than today! My love for Beijing is no longer just for the beautiful gardens and magnificent palaces. The most beautiful thing is the people of today! Beijing is indeed lovely, not just my personal subjectivity.
    Ten or twenty years ago, even if you were born in Beijing, you couldn't be without vigilance: it's best to keep your mouth tightly closed to a stranger. One wrong word can cause trouble. When you go to buy something, you also have to be careful not to be cheated. You live in your hometown, but you have to be wary of everything. Today, you can happily go to where you want to go, without having to worry at all. The Tianqiao area, which was long occupied by local bullies and gangsters, and the markets with exorbitant prices, are now the same as other places, full of harmony, with no bargaining. Some of the beautiful scenes of utopia depicted by the ancients have come true before your eyes, but they are more real and reliable than utopia. You can't help but want to change "the virtue of the gentleman is like the wind" to "the virtue of the people is like the wind," and it is a gentle east wind, making everything flourish and grow endlessly.
    It seems that I still have to return to the matter of Aunt Wang and Aunt Li. Without mentioning them, I can hardly end this short essay. Yes, I sincerely want to congratulate all those who have turned themselves around; but when I see the liberation of women in Beijing and the whole country, I can't help but be overjoyed. From ancient times until before liberation, haven't women suffered greater and more numerous grievances than men? Only the liberation of women is sufficient to prove that our social system is indeed superior. Yes, what could be more beautiful than our women today! Look at them, decades ago they shouldn't even show their teeth when they smiled, but today they bear the same heavy responsibility as men in socialist construction. Isn't this a dream? It is indeed not a dream, but an ironclad fact. Every time I hear that my neighbor's daughter Erfeng is going to Xinjiang to explore, or that my niece Xiaolan has been admitted to a dance school to study ballet, I smile so much that I can't close my mouth. These little girls are simply overturning a twenty-four history book and writing a new history! In the past, wasn't the biggest worry of Aunt Wang and Aunt Li day and night how to find a good husband for their daughters? Today, the old ladies can rest assured. Their daughters stand tall like men. If I were a poet, I would write many of the most beautiful poems every day to praise and encourage our sisters. Although I can't write poetry, I still use drama to praise them. I have described many women in my plays. None of them have been written well, yes. But no matter how clumsy my pen is, I will write. I seem to want to apologize to them for the old history and congratulate them on the new history. This statement is not meant to boast, I really can't stop, I have to write, even if it's not like anything. Women's liberation is such an extraordinary thing!
    The social atmosphere is changing, and it's getting better and better. For me, who came from the old society, I have indeed come out of a dark room and entered a new world of sunshine and warmth. Beijing is the capital of this new world. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are all here. Under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of Beijing have established unprecedented new social mores. This short essay is really messy because I am excited. Forgive me! I still have thousands of words to say, but I won't say any more, because I can't control myself and I have to cheer immediately. I cheer:
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

老舍

专栏：十年颂歌

    新风气
    老舍
    十年来，首都的变化极大，连我这个北京人也不敢夸口说熟悉北京了。是的，许多新街我还没走过，许多老街变了样子。连街道都不大认识了，还说什么熟悉北京呢？
    真的，要想大致说明白了北京的十年变化，必须写厚厚的一本书。而且没有一个人会写这本书，因为没有一个人能够知道那么多的事，足以源源本本地介绍一切。单说上下水道的建设，就够一位专家写成一本书的；不是吗？
    我看哪，我顶好说点家长里短吧。我有不少久住北京的亲友，假若他们的生活习惯有所改变，就足以证明他们的思想、感情也都有了变化。换句话说，他们受了革命教育。
    您以为打苍蝇这件事简单吗？可不简单！就拿王大妈说吧，在从前，她天天要给财神与灶王上香，每逢初一、十五要吃素，手不肯抹死一个臭虫，脚不踩坏一个蚂蚁。您看，她肯去打苍蝇吗？可是，现在她居然积极参加街道上的除四害工作，时时刻刻向苍蝇、蚊子进攻。
    王大妈变了。她懂得了清洁卫生的重要，知道了苍蝇是可以要她的命的坏东西。她若不亲自动手去消灭苍蝇，苍蝇就会消灭她。她不再磕头祷告神明，而拿起苍蝇拍子来。这个变化不小！王大妈在思想上大概跃进了一百多年！假若她还相信因为她得罪了苍蝇，阎王爷就可能叫她下辈子转生为小猫小狗，她可怎能理直气壮地去争取作个灭蝇的模范呢？不，她不信那老一套了。她放弃了只为自己积德求福的办法，而代之以干些有益于别人也有益于自己的事情。这可不简单！她这么转变了，因为她遇上了社会主义。只有社会主义才能够叫王大妈一跃而前进了一个多世纪！
    再看李大妈吧。她倒不相信苍蝇死后可能到阎王爷那里去告状，她相信“没脏没净，吃了没病”。她认为打苍蝇是多此一举。可是，她近来居然向王大妈挑起战来，看卫生红旗先到谁的手里。她的“没脏没净论”彻底地被更高的理论与实践给驳倒。她要求身心一致干净，不能落后于王大妈。当然，王大妈在说服李大妈这件事上是有相当功劳的。
    每一条街上都有不少王大妈与李大妈，于是北京就基本上消灭了苍蝇。当然，王大爷与李大爷和王大嫂与李姑娘也并没袖手旁观。全北京的人民都受了清洁卫生运动的教育，全北京的大街小巷也就都干净起来。这真是移风易俗的事体。
    上面所说的不过是移风易俗的一个例子。别的例子还多得很。
    前几天，我看见一位骑自行车的几乎碰着一个小姑娘。小姑娘躲开了，可是她手上托着的豆腐掉在了地上。骑车的立住了，小姑娘也立住了，都没出声。一位立在路旁的人向他们点点手，没说什么。骑车的向路边靠了靠，小姑娘跟过来。路旁的那位看了看她，确是没有碰着，于是指了指地上的豆腐。骑车的拿出一毛钱来，交给了小姑娘；笑了笑，上了车。小姑娘向路旁人点点头，转身去再买豆腐。路旁人还立在那里，也许是在等着什么人。
    社会主义造英雄。我们天天处处出现新的英雄与英雄事迹。上面提到的一语未发而解决了问题的小故事里并没有英雄。可是，即使这么小的一件事，也只能发生在今天。您若不信，我可以按照旧社会的规律从新安排一下这件事：小姑娘一见豆腐掉在地上，必定大哭起来。骑车的呢，十之八九是加速蹬车，飞跑而去。假若他难以脱身，他必大喊大叫，把过错完全推到小姑娘身上去。于是，就围上许多人，袖手看热闹。及至“观众”增加到站满了马路，断绝了交通，警察才姗姗而来。问题还不能解决。直到小姑娘的家长来了，才一齐上了派出所，后面跟着一群“观众”。
    我一点也没想夸大其词。在旧社会里，我天天可以看到与此类似的事情。现在，小姑娘准知道会有人替她说理，她何必哭呢？骑车的准知道，不要说碰了人，就是碰了豆腐，也必须站住赔礼。路旁人准知道，他必须帮助小姑娘，而且不会因此招来闲气；今天绝对不会有把送殡的也埋在坟地里的事情了。由于党的教育，社会风气变了。
    十年来，在街上打架斗殴的，酗酒滋事的，招摇过市的，越来越少了。我们的街道干干净净，人民的举止言谈也干干净净。这使我更爱北京了。在解放前，我糊口四方，老想念着北京，而又怕回来。一回到北京，去听听戏，或逛逛公园，就许招一肚子气。在戏院里，正如在电车上，没有票的个个威风凛凛，有票的反倒活该受欺侮。不要说自己挨了打骂，就是看着那个情景，心里也堵得慌——为什么到处是这样不合理呢！我多么喜爱北京啊，可是北京就应该是这个样子吗？因此，每次回来就必定伤一次心！
    现在呢，每逢我上街走走，总会增加不少喜悦。不管是去理发、洗澡，还是买点东西，我的面前总是许多笑脸，跟到了家里一样。假若笑脸与客气话都是例行公事，那便虚伪无可取。不，不是这样。每个人都是诚于中形于外的，的确从心里愿意为别人服务。每个人的笑容是社会主义教育的一朵心花，不是勉强作态。是的，这使人到处如坐春风，心中不但得到温暖，而且随时增加对社会主义的热爱和对党的感激！
    人与人的关系起了很大很大的变化。当一位服务员热情地伺候了我之后，我没法子不想伺候伺候他。我不会卖东西或理发，可是我也有我的工作。我要把我的工作作好，作为向服务员们的酬谢。我个人是这样，我想全社会的人都是心同此理。要不然，短短十年内北京怎么会起了这么大的变化呢？
    人与人的关系既变，人的无聊的负担就减轻许多，可以把精力集中地用在有意义的事情上去了。想想看，在旧社会的家庭里，要有多少规矩啊。不要说遇上婚丧，须闹得人仰马翻，乃至倾家破产，就是在平日里，婆媳之间，父子之间，也往往因小小的失礼而争吵不休。今天呢，谁都争取出去作点事，人与人的关系不再由虚伪的规矩束管着，而是由新的风气鼓舞着，都要各尽所能地去为社会服务。不要说青年男女，就是老人们也不肯完全闲着。是呀，王大妈和李大妈不都尽心尽力地作街道工作吗？这么一来，大家就都对生活有了更深刻的认识，要活得更有意义，更有价值。男女老少的眼睛不专看自己的家里，而看到全胡同，全北京，甚至全国了。眼睛看得远，心里自然会亮堂，再也不在那些无聊的规矩上多捣什么乱了。于是，家庭就更和睦，邻里就更亲热了，向来被视为落后的大杂院反倒成为红旗高扬的模范院子了。人人相爱相助，难道不是最大的幸福么？
    是呀，在这幸福的环境里，游手好闲就很不体面了。从我能够记事的时候起，直到解放前，有不少北京人是以游手好闲为荣的。在他们眼中，谁横草不动，竖草不拿，谁的命好。当然，他们的手也不能永远不动。他们会打牌，和往嘴里送好吃的东西。他们的生活意义就是消磨时间。他们的一天也等于二十年，光闲着没事作嘛。他们不创造历史，而等历史结果了他们。由他们的一天等于二十年到我们的一天等于二十年，是多么大的变化呀！
    劳动光荣代替了有闲为荣。只有这样，整个的北京才亲如一家。谁也不高，谁也不低，肯出力的都是兄弟姐妹。人人仿佛都觉得我是北京的，北京也是我的。我尊敬一切肯劳动的人，一切劳动的人也尊敬我，只要我不游手好闲。这是多么美丽的光景呀！谁跟谁都是同志，朋友，相逢不必曾相识，就伸出手来亲热地互握。这是多么可喜可爱的现象啊！
    虽然我生在北京，爱北京，可是在十年前我也有时候觉得这种爱是主观的，并不一定对的。现在，每逢走在街上，我就好像摸到了生命的真实意义：是的，人是应该这样活着，人人平等，人人自由，用劳动与智慧创造自己的与大家的幸福，叫明天比今天更幸福！我对北京的爱不再只寄于美丽的园林与金碧辉煌的宫殿了。最美丽的是今天的人民！北京的确可爱了，并非是我个人的主观。
    在十年或二十年前，尽管是生在北京的人，也不可没有戒心：对一个生人，顶好把自己的嘴闭得严严的。一句错话就会惹出祸来。去买一件东西，也须留神不要受骗。你住在故乡，却得提防一切。今天，你可以高高兴兴地去上你要去的地方，一点也不必顾虑。那久被恶霸流氓割据的天桥，和漫天要价的市场，也都跟别的地方一样了，都是一团和气，言无二价。前贤们所描绘的乌托邦的某些美景实现在你的眼前，可是比乌托邦更真实可靠。你没法不想把“君子之德风”改成为“人民之德风”，而且是和畅的东风，使一切欣欣向荣，生生不已。
    似乎还得回到王大妈与李大妈的事情上来。不提到她们，我几乎没法子结束这篇短文。不错，我诚心地愿向一切翻了身的人道喜；可是，看到北京的和全国的妇女的解放，我不能不狂喜了。自古代到解放前，妇女不是比男人受的委屈更大更多吗？只有妇女得到解放才足以证明我们的社会制度的确优越。是呀，有什么能比我们今天的妇女更美丽的呢！看看她们，几十年前还得连笑都不该露齿，今天却和男人同样地担起社会主义建设的重任。这难道不是个梦么？的确不是梦，而是铁一般的事实。每一听到邻居的二凤要到新疆去勘探，或侄女小兰考中了舞蹈学校，去学芭蕾舞，我就笑得闭不上嘴。这些小姑娘们简直是推翻了一部二十四史，而正在另写一部新史呀！在从前，王大妈和李大妈所日夜焦思的不是怎么给女儿找个好婆家吗？今天，老大娘们可省了心。她们的姑娘跟男子一样的顶天立地啊。假若我是诗人呀，我会每天写多少首最美的诗，去赞颂与鼓舞我们的姐妹们。尽管我不会作诗，我还是用戏剧表扬了她们。在剧本中我描写过不少妇女。都没有写好，是的。但是，不管我的笔有多么笨，我也要写。我好像要替旧历史向她们道歉，为新历史向她们贺喜。这话并没有自夸的意思，我的确是欲罢不能，我非写不可，尽管写的不像样子。妇女解放，这是多么不平凡的事啊！
    社会风气在变，越变越好。对于我这由旧社会里过来的人说，我的确是由暗室中出来，走入了风和日朗的新天地中。北京是这个新天地的首都。党中央和毛主席都在这里。在党和毛主席的教育下，北京人民树立起史无前例的新风气。这篇短文实在写的凌乱，因为我激动。原谅我吧！我还有千言万语，但是不再说下去，因为我已不能控制自己，非马上欢呼不可了。我欢呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
