　　To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation, the capital city will begin a twenty-day series of theatrical, musical, dance, ballad, acrobatics, and puppet performances from the 21st onwards. More than sixty artistic troupes from over twenty provinces, cities, military units, and trade union systems across the country will participate in the performances, encompassing various forms of stage art and major opera genres from all over the country. These diverse artistic performances vividly depict the tremendous changes and new face of our country over the past decade, reflecting the history of revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the past few decades, and the struggle life and diligent, courageous character of our ancient people. The performances will involve approximately seven thousand people, with a program encompassing ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign works, on a grand and unprecedented scale. This performance vividly and centrally demonstrates the vibrant and colorful scene of a hundred flowers blooming in our country's artistic garden.

　　In this celebratory performance, the audience will see musical and dance performances with rich ethnic flavor performed by more than ten fraternal ethnic groups, vividly demonstrating the glorious scene of the parallel development of our country's multi-ethnic artistic endeavors. Traditional opera is a unique artistic heritage of our country, and it shines with unprecedented new brilliance in socialist society. Here, there are ancient opera genres that have gained new life, as well as vibrant young opera genres that have gradually grown up since liberation. The superb acting skills of veteran artists and the vigorous artistic talents of the younger generation complement each other. Over the past decade, our country's amateur artistic activities have also developed rapidly, becoming a valuable source of nourishment for our country's art, promoting the improvement of our country's artistic quality and the expansion of the artistic ranks. The performances by the amateur performance teams participating in the celebratory performance fully demonstrate the infinite creative power of the masses' wisdom.

　　The reason why our country's stage art has been able to achieve such rapid development and great achievements in the past decade is primarily due to the correct leadership of the Party in artistic work and the Party's kind concern for artistic workers. The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong has given literary and art workers a clear goal to strive for. Therefore, our literary and artistic works have become a powerful tool for the Party to educate the people and a sharp weapon for fighting the enemy. Opera performers like to use the phrase "The old society turned people into ghosts, the new society turns ghosts into people" to describe the different encounters they have experienced in the old and new societies. Similarly, the prosperity and development of the entire artistic endeavor in the new society is in stark contrast to its decline and decay in the old era. Taking opera as an example, before liberation, even prosperous big cities like Shanghai and Beijing could not even support a Kunqu Opera troupe with an excellent heritage. Today, we have discovered more than 360 large and small opera genres, and have established a large number of new troupes and cultivated new talents. Various local operas have excavated and整理 a large number of traditional repertoires, and some opera genres have even collected and recorded thousands of scripts. Looking at ballet, in the past few years, our song and dance troupes have created many works with various themes and rich national flavor; at the same time, with the selfless help of Soviet experts, in just five years, our newly established dance school has cultivated a group of young actors who can skillfully master ballet techniques, and their performances of large-scale foreign classical ballets have won praise from all quarters. These concrete facts fully demonstrate the superiority of our country's socialist system and the correctness of the Party's literary and artistic policies. Some people say that the new society cannot create artistic talents. But what are the facts? The excellent young actors participating in this celebratory performance are not just one or two, and some troupes are entirely composed of young actors, which is a powerful rebuttal to this absurd argument.

　　This celebratory performance, with its dazzling array of beautiful items, vividly illustrates the great victory of the Party's literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" in artistic work. Although our country has a rich opera heritage, before liberation, many opera genres were on the verge of extinction, and some were even about to die out. In recent years, not only have ancient opera genres such as Kunqu, Yiyang Opera, and Hui Opera been revived, but also new opera genres such as Wanwanqiang, Gansu Daoqing, Errentai, and Wenqin Opera have been developed on the basis of shadow puppetry and folk music. In terms of performance, thanks to the Party's advocacy of various artistic schools, in order to enable various performance arts with different styles to coexist on the stage and to be further developed, the Mei school, Cheng school, Shang school, and Xun school of Peking Opera dan roles, with the strong support and help of the government, not only have their own artistic brilliance flourished, but also have been assigned talented young actors to inherit and develop their artistic achievements. In terms of music, from the programs of this celebratory performance, we can also see that while national and folk music have been greatly developed, in order to enrich our art treasure house, the Western symphony form has also become our artistic means to reflect real life. Domestic and foreign hostile elements, in order to slander the Party's literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom", have fabricated various rumors, saying that we are only talking about it verbally and that it is not actually the case. So, now let us ask them to open their eyes and see the facts. The dazzling scenery in our country's art garden is the most powerful answer to all the enemy's rumors and slanders.

　　Under the Party's unity, education, and kind concern, after years of political and ideological movements, the vast number of artistic workers have deeply criticized bourgeois artistic viewpoints and greatly improved their political and ideological level. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they have gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside, going deep into factories, rural areas, and military units, performing for the masses, and laboring together with the masses. Therefore, they have generally improved their class consciousness, and many people have gloriously joined the Communist Party. They have also greatly broken through their past levels in terms of artistic quality, creating many exquisite and exciting works. This National Day celebratory performance is a concrete reflection of the Great Leap Forward in our country's artistic work.

　　In the art garden, the past decade has also been a glorious decade. Under the leadership of the Party, our country's artistic endeavors have achieved great successes, and the ideological and professional level of artistic workers has also been significantly improved. However, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. In this high-spirited and heroic era, we need to make arduous and greater efforts to climb to the peak of art. Therefore, every one of our artistic workers must unremittingly study Marxism, continue to delve deeply into the fiery struggle life of the masses, participate in labor training, and constantly improve their ideological level. At the same time, they must work harder to improve their artistic skills, learn traditional art, and absorb the essence of the world's excellent art, and strive to create brilliant socialist artistic works.

    百花竞艳迎国庆
    为了庆祝建国十周年，从21日起，首都开始举行为期二十天的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、杂技、木偶等献礼演出。参加演出的有全国各地二十多个省、市、部队和工会系统的六十多个艺术团体，包括各种形式的舞台艺术和全国各地的主要剧种。这些多种多样的艺术演出，生动地表现了十年来我国的巨大变化和崭新面貌，反映了几十年来在中国共产党领导下我国人民所进行的革命斗争历史和我国古代人民的斗争生活，他们的勤劳勇敢的品德。参加演出的人数达七千人左右，节目包括古今中外，规模巨大，盛况空前。这次演出集中而又鲜明地表现了我国艺术园地中万紫千红、百花齐放的一片绚烂景色。
    在这次献礼演出中，观众将看到十多个兄弟民族演出的富有民族风味的音乐舞蹈，它们生动地显示了我国多民族艺术事业并肩发展的光辉景象。戏曲是我国特有的艺术遗产，它们在社会主义社会里，放出了前所未有的新的光彩。这里有获得了新的生命的古老剧种，也有在解放以后才逐渐成长起来的生气勃勃的年青剧种。前辈艺人的精湛演技和青年一代旺盛的艺术才能互相辉映。十年来，我国的业余艺术活动也得到了迅速的发展，它成了我国艺术汲取营养的宝贵源泉，促进了我国艺术质量的提高和艺术队伍的壮大。从参加献礼演出的业余演出队的表演中，充分显示了群众智慧的无穷的创造力量。
    十年来我国舞台艺术事业能够获得这样飞跃的发展和巨大成绩，首先是由于党对艺术工作的正确领导和对艺术工作者的亲切关怀。毛泽东同志对文艺工作者提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，使得文艺工作者有了明确的努力目标，因此，我们的文艺作品成为党教育人民群众的有力工具，和对敌人作战的锐利武器。戏曲艺人很喜欢用“旧社会使人变成鬼，新社会使鬼变成人”这句话来形容他们在新旧社会所受到的不同遭遇。同样地，整个艺术事业在新社会的繁荣发展也是和在旧时代的衰落雕敝形成鲜明的对照。拿戏曲来说，解放前像上海、北京这样所谓繁华的大城市，甚至养不活一个有着优秀遗产的昆曲剧团，如今，我们却已经发现了三百六十多个大小剧种，而且大批地建立了新的剧团，培养了新的人才。各种地方戏都发掘和整理了大量传统剧目，有些剧种甚至收集、记录了成千上万的剧本。再看舞剧吧，几年来我们的歌舞团已经创作了不少各种题材、富有民族风味的作品；同时，在苏联专家无私的帮助下，仅仅五年时间，我们新建立的舞蹈学校就培养了一批能够熟练地掌握舞剧技巧的青年演员，他们演出的外国的大型古典舞剧曾博得各方面的好评。这些具体的事实充分地表明了我国社会主义制度的优越性和党的文艺政策的正确性。有人说，新社会不能造就艺术人才。可是事实怎样呢？参加这次献礼演出的优秀的青年演员并不是一个两个，有的剧团整个都是由青年演员组成的，这是对这种荒谬言论的有力驳斥。
    这一次献礼演出，琳琅满目，美不胜收，生动地说明了党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”文艺方针在艺术工作中所取得的巨大胜利。我国虽有着丰富的戏曲遗产，但在解放前有不少剧种已濒于绝境，有的甚至快要灭亡。这几年来不仅陆续救活了昆曲、弋阳腔、徽剧等古老剧种，同时还从皮影、民间音乐等的基础上发展了如碗碗腔、甘肃道情、二人台、文琴戏等新的剧种。在表演方面，由于党对各种艺术流派的提倡，为了使得各种不同风格的表演艺术在舞台上并存，并得到更进一步的发展，如京剧旦角的梅派、程派、尚派、荀派在政府的大力支持和帮助下，不但他们本人的艺术光采焕发，还给他们分配了有才能的青年演员继承和发扬他们的艺术成就。在音乐方面，从这次献礼演出的节目中，我们也可以看出在民族、民间音乐得到很大发展的同时，为了丰富我们的艺术宝库，西洋的交响乐形式也成了我们反映现实生活的艺术手段。国内外敌对分子为了污蔑党的“百花齐放”的文艺方针，造出种种谣言，说我们只是口头讲讲，实际上并不是这么回事。那么，现在我们就请他们睁开眼来看看事实罢。我国艺术花园中光采夺目的景色就是对敌人的一切造谣中伤的最有力的答复。
    在党的团结教育和亲切关怀下，经过了历年的政治思想运动，广大的艺术工作者深刻地批判了资产阶级的艺术观点，政治思想水平大大提高了。特别是1958年全民大跃进以来，他们上山下乡，深入工厂、农村、部队，为群众演出，和群众一同劳动，因此普遍地提高了阶级觉悟，有不少人已经光荣地参加了共产党，在艺术质量上也大大地突破了过去的水平，创造了不少精美的、激动人心的作品。这次国庆献礼演出就是我国艺术工作大跃进的具体反映。
    在艺术园地中，过去的十年同样也是辉煌的十年。在党的领导下，我国的艺术事业获得了很大的成绩，艺术工作者的思想和业务水平也有了显著的提高。但是，我们不能够满足现状。在这个意气风发的英雄时代，我们要攀登到艺术的顶峰，还需要作艰巨的更大的努力。因此，我们每一个艺术工作者必须坚持不懈地学习马克思主义，继续深入群众火热的斗争生活，参加劳动锻炼，来不断地提高自己的思想水平，同时要更加努力提高艺术技巧，学习传统艺术，并且汲取世界优秀艺术的精华，为创造社会主义的辉煌的艺术作品而奋斗。
