Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 13th. The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on September 7th, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' use of torture to retaliate against former resistance personnel.

The letter stated that since the restoration of peace, Le Thi Phuong, a former resistance fighter from My Ai commune, Cao Lanh district, Sa Dec province, South Vietnam, has been working as a nurse. On November 10th of last year, when Le Thi Phuong was on a business trip passing through the Thong Linh stronghold, she was tied up by the henchmen of the South Vietnamese authorities and sent to Cao Lanh prison for detention. The letter pointed out that Le Thi Phuong suffered the most brutal atrocities in prison. The henchmen of the South Vietnamese authorities stripped her naked, used red-hot iron bars to burn her thighs, subjected her to electric shocks, and force-fed her with soapy water and dirty water, and stepped all over her bloated stomach with studded shoes. Le Thi Phuong suffered the above-mentioned torture more than once. Within a month, she was force-fed seventeen buckets of soapy water and dirty water, subjected to electric shocks five times, and had her thighs burned with red-hot iron bars six times.

The letter pointed out that Le Thi Phuong is still being imprisoned and has become disabled due to torture, and her life is in imminent danger.

In the letter, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army requested the International Commission in Vietnam to investigate the above-mentioned incident and take measures to have the South Vietnamese authorities immediately restore Le Thi Phuong's freedom.

    越南人民军联络代表团函国际委员会
    抗议南越当局迫害前抗战人员
    新华社河内13日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团9月7日写信给越南国际委员会，抗议南越当局用酷刑向前抗战人员进行报复。
    信中说，南越沙得省高岭县美艾乡前抗战人员黎氏芳在和平恢复以来，一直从事护士工作。去年11月10日，黎氏芳出差路过统岭据点时，被南越当局的爪牙捆起来，并押送入高岭监牢监禁。信中指出，黎氏芳在监牢里受到最残酷的暴行。南越当局的爪牙们把她的衣服剥光，用烧红的铁条烫大腿，施电刑，灌肥皂水和脏水，穿着钉鞋在她被灌胀的肚子上乱踩。黎氏芳遭受上述酷刑不止一次，仅在一个月内，她就被灌了十七桶肥皂水和脏水，受五次电刑，六次被用烧红的铁条烫大腿。
    信中指出，黎氏芳直到现在仍然被监禁着，由于遭受酷刑而成了残废，性命危在旦夕。
    越南人民军联络代表团在信中要求越南国际委员会就上述事件进行调查，并采取措施使南越当局立即恢复黎氏芳的自由。
