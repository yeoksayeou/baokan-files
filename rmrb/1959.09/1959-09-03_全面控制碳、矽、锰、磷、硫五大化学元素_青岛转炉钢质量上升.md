Qingdao, September 2nd (By our reporter) - The Qingdao City converter steelmaking units, known for producing high-quality steel from high-sulfur iron, have built on their success in controlling the sulfur content of steel ingots. Aiming at the mechanical performance requirements of steel, they have actively adopted measures to comprehensively control the five major chemical elements: carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur. This has led to a double leap in both the quality and quantity of converter steel. In the first half of August, the average daily steel output increased by 29.47% compared to July; the quality qualification rate reached 86.43%, an increase of 3.25% compared to July, with the first-grade product rate reaching 65.1%.

    In the first quarter of this year, all converter steelmaking units in Qingdao City adopted hot-air alkaline pig iron furnaces, which essentially eliminated sulfur within the pig iron furnace. This not only improved the quality of the steel but also allowed for smoother smelting since the converter was no longer the primary desulfurization tool. Each furnace smelting time is generally around twenty minutes, leading to a significant increase in output. In mid-June, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a national converter steelmaking quality improvement conference to summarize and promote Qingdao City's experiences. Following the conference, the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized fifteen converter steelmaking production units throughout the city to conscientiously implement the spirit of the conference, mobilizing the masses to further improve the overall quality of steel. All steelmaking units in the city, in conjunction with production, mobilized the masses to comprehensively inspect the quality of steel. They not only tested for the five elements of carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur, enabling workers to understand the impact of each element on the mechanical properties of steel, but also dissected steel ingots. They sought to expose defects hidden within the steel ingots due to poor casting, such as shrinkage cavities, porosity, sand inclusions, and segregation, so the workers could understand the true situation. At the same time, they conducted rolling tests on steel ingots produced by various units to analyze and compare the quality of the steel; in terms of process, they carried out hot rolling, cold drawing, forging, and heat treatment tests; and in production, they conducted tests on wire drawing, nail making, needle making, and bicycle parts manufacturing. Assessments were made based on the quality requirements of these products. Through this series of technical inspections and practical application tests, it was discovered that although the sulfur content of the steel produced by many units in the past generally met the standards, the steel's mechanical properties after rolling were still affected because elements such as carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus were not stable enough, or because, despite all five elements meeting the requirements, deoxidation and casting operations were poor. In response to these situations, each factory organized steel ingot quality exhibitions and quality seminars, using concrete facts to conduct ideological education on comprehensively improving quality for cadres and the masses.

    In order to comprehensively control the five major elements and meet the requirements of the converter steel quality standards issued by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Qingdao Municipal Committee, after obtaining experience in comprehensively improving the quality of converter steel in the Qingdao Bicycle Factory's steelmaking workshop, immediately helped summarize it and held an on-site meeting to promote it throughout the city. In the process of learning from the Bicycle Factory's experience, each steelmaking unit, after strengthening analysis and repeated testing, is now able to know in advance the silicon and manganese content of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese, and to basically and more accurately grasp the carbon content of molten steel. They have also begun to explore their own data on silicon and manganese recovery rates. This allows them to actively determine the amount of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese to add based on the amount of molten steel in each furnace and the carbon content, effectively avoiding the frequently occurring phenomena of high carbon and low manganese or low carbon and high manganese in the past. In terms of blowing and smelting operations, each factory tightly controls the three key links of carbon removal, deoxidation, and casting to control the chemical composition of carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and other elements, and to prevent the formation of defects such as pores, sand inclusions, and shrinkage pipes in steel ingots.

    全面控制碳、矽、锰、磷、硫五大化学元素
    青岛转炉钢质量上升
    本报青岛2日电　以高硫铁炼出好钢著名的青岛市转炉炼钢单位，在控制了钢锭含硫量的基础上，乘胜前进，针对钢材机械性能的要求，积极采取措施，全面控制碳、矽、锰、磷、硫五大化学元素，使转炉钢质量产量双双跃进。8月上半月钢的平均日产量比7月份提高29.47％；质量合格率达到86.43％，比7月份提高3.25％，其中一级品率达到65.1％。
    青岛市转炉炼钢单位在今年第一季度全部采用热风碱性化铁炉，把硫基本上消灭在化铁炉内，不但提高了钢的质量，而且由于转炉不充当主要的脱硫工具，使冶炼进行顺利，每炉吹炼时间一般在二十分钟左右，因而产量大增。冶金工业部在6月中旬曾召开全国转炉炼钢提高质量会议，对青岛市的经验加以总结推广。会后，中共青岛市委组织全市十五个转炉炼钢生产单位认真贯彻会议精神，发动群众进一步全面提高钢的质量。全市所有炼钢单位都结合生产，发动群众全面检查了钢的质量。他们不仅化验碳、矽、锰、磷、硫五种元素，使职工了解各种元素对钢材机械性能的影响，还解剖了钢锭，设法将隐藏在钢锭内部的缩孔重接、夹砂、偏拆等由于浇铸不良而造成的缺陷表面化，使职工们了解真象。同时，将各单位生产的钢锭进行轧制钢材的试验，对钢材质量加以分析比较；在工艺方面进行热轧、冷拔、锻打、热处理等试验；在生产上作拉丝、制钉、制针和制造自行车零件的试验，并按照这些产品的质量要求作了鉴定。通过这一系列技术检查和实际应用的试验，发现不少单位过去生产的钢虽然含硫量一般合格，但是由于碳、矽、锰、磷等元素不够稳定，或者五大元素虽然合乎要求，但由于脱氧和浇铸等操作不良，也影响了钢锭轧材后的机械性能。针对这些情况，各厂组织了钢锭质量展览会和质量座谈会，用具体事实向干部和群众进行了全面提高质量的思想教育。
    为了全面控制五大元素实现冶金工业部颁发的转炉钢质量标准的要求，青岛市委在青岛自行车厂炼钢车间取得全面提高转炉钢质量的经验以后，立即帮助总结，召开现场会议在全市推广。各炼钢单位在学习自行车厂经验的过程中，经过加强分析及反复试验，现在已能做到事先了解矽铁、锰铁的含矽含锰量和基本上比较准确地掌握钢水的含碳量，并且开始摸索出自己的矽、锰回收率的数据。这样便可以主动地根据每炉钢水的数量和碳的含量，确定矽铁、锰铁的加入量，有效地避免了过去经常发生的碳高锰低或碳低锰高的现象。在吹炼操作方面，各厂都紧紧掌握拉碳、脱氧和浇铸三个环节，以控制碳、矽、锰、磷等化学成分，防止钢锭产生气孔、夹砂和缩管等缺陷。
