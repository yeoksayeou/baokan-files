Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: This reporter reports: This afternoon, Soong Ching-ling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, met at her home with the delegation of the Soviet-China Friendship Association headed by Tikhonov and the delegation of the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet-China Friendship Association headed by Popov. When the Soviet friends arrived, President Soong Ching-ling stood at the entrance of the reception room, greeting them with a smile and shaking hands with each guest.

Comrade Tikhonov vividly expressed the joyful mood of the Soviet friends meeting President Soong Ching-ling in the language of a poet. He presented President Soong Ching-ling with a golden fist from the top of a flagpole used during the Boxer Rebellion. This was looted from Beijing by Waldersee, the commander of the Eight-Nation Alliance that suppressed the Boxer Rebellion, and taken to Berlin. When the Soviet Red Army captured Berlin, a Red Army soldier took the golden fist as a trophy to Moscow and gave it to a Soviet poet, who later passed it on to Comrade Tikhonov. Comrade Tikhonov once wrote a poem about this matter.

When Comrade Tikhonov presented the gift to President Soong Ching-ling, he said excitedly: "This golden fist, symbolizing the great power of the Chinese people, has traveled from Beijing to Berlin, from Berlin to Moscow, and finally from Moscow to Beijing. It has 'returned to its original owner'!"

President Soong Ching-ling accepted this precious gift and said very happily: "I will put it in the historical museum. This gift once again proves the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union!"

Mirbabayeva, the first female train driver of the Uzbek Republic, brought greetings from the Soviet working people to President Soong Ching-ling. She placed a shimmering, pearl-like hat of the people of the Uzbek Republic on President Soong Ching-ling's head, and President Soong Ching-ling repeatedly kissed her warmly. Berevertsev, a worker representative from the Moscow Shcherbakov Silk Factory, and other Soviet friends also presented her with various meaningful gifts. President Soong Ching-ling accepted these gifts and repeatedly expressed her gratitude to the friends.

The deep friendship made everyone extraordinarily happy. Liu Ningyi, Li Dequan, and Qian Junrui, vice presidents and secretary-general of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, also had cordial conversations with the guests. Liu Ningyi said to the Soviet friends: "This meeting embodies the great friendship between our two countries with 800 million people. We are moving from unity to unity, from victory to greater victory, from socialism to communism!" Yefimov, chairman of the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, said that small rivers can converge into surging rivers, and small acts of friendship can develop into eternal friendship. He wished the Soviet-China friendship would develop forever. Danilov, the deputy head of the delegation, said to President Soong Ching-ling that all the Soviet people also regard October 1st as their own great festival, and now, whether in cities or villages, millions of Soviet people are preparing to celebrate this great festival. Wei Lixiajin, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, also attended this joyful meeting today.

The hosts and guests chatted happily like family members. Finally, President Soong Ching-ling took a group photo with everyone to commemorate this meaningful meeting. (Attached picture)

    宋庆龄接见苏中友协代表团
    吉洪诺夫把义和团起义时所用旗杆上的一个金色拳头送给宋会长
    新华社27日讯　本社记者报道：今天下午，中苏友好协会总会宋庆龄会长在她的家里接见了以吉洪诺夫为首的苏中友好协会代表团和以波波夫为首的苏中友好协会列宁格勒分会代表团。当苏联朋友们到达的时候，宋庆龄会长站在会客室门口含笑迎接，同客人一一握手。
    吉洪诺夫同志以诗人的语言，生动地表达了苏联朋友们会见宋庆龄会长的愉快心情。他把一个义和团起义时用的旗杆顶上的金色拳头送给了宋庆龄会长。这是当年镇压中国义和团起义的八国联军的统帅瓦德西从北京劫到柏林的，在苏联红军攻克柏林的时候，一位红军战士把这金色拳头作为战胜品带给莫斯科，并且把它送给了苏联的一位诗人，后来这位诗人又转送给了吉洪诺夫同志，吉洪诺夫同志曾经为这件事情写过一首诗。
    当吉洪诺夫同志把礼物送给宋庆龄会长的时候，他激动地说：“这象征着中国人民伟大力量的金色拳头，从北京到柏林，从柏林到莫斯科，最后又从莫斯科到北京，这是‘物归原主’啊！”
    宋庆龄会长接过了这珍贵的礼物，非常高兴地说：“我要把它放在历史博物馆里。这礼物，再一次证明了中苏两国牢不可破的伟大友谊！”
    乌兹别克共和国第一个火车女司机米尔巴巴耶娃给宋庆龄会长带来了苏联劳动人民的问候，她把一顶乌兹别克共和国人民的像珍珠一样闪闪发光的帽子戴在宋庆龄会长头上，宋庆龄会长一再同她热烈亲吻。莫斯科谢尔巴柯夫丝织厂的工人代表别列维尔塞夫和其他一些苏联朋友们也向她赠送了各种各样有意义的礼品。宋庆龄会长接受了这些礼品，一再向朋友们表示谢意。
    友谊深情使每一个人都欢乐非凡。在座的中苏友好协会总会副会长刘宁一、李德全和秘书长钱俊瑞都和客人们亲切谈心。刘宁一对苏联朋友们说：“这次会见体现了我们两国八亿人民的伟大友谊，我们是从团结走向团结，从胜利走向更大的胜利，从社会主义走上共产主义！”苏中友好协会列宁格勒分会主席叶菲莫夫说，一条条小河可以汇成汹涌澎湃的大江，一件件友谊的事情可以发展成永恒的友谊。他祝贺苏中友谊永远发展。达尼洛夫副团长对宋庆龄会长说，苏联全体人民把10月1日也看成是自己的伟大节日，现在，不管在城市和乡村，千千万万苏联人民都在筹备庆祝这个伟大节日。苏联驻中国大使馆参赞魏立夏金今天也参加了这一欢乐的会见。
    宾主就像一家人那样开怀畅谈。最后，宋庆龄会长同大家一起合影，纪念这次有意义的会见。（附图片）
