Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th. The Guangzhou Steel Plant's seamless steel pipe workshop has been completed. On the evening of the 22nd, it rolled out the first rough pipe, with an outer diameter of eighty millimeters, a thickness of eight millimeters, and a length of 1.55 meters. After processing, the rough pipe can become a seamless steel pipe. From now on, South China has unveiled the prelude to the mass production of seamless steel pipes.

The production process of this workshop is mostly mechanized, and it can produce more than 15,000 tons of seamless steel pipes ranging from five millimeters to seventy-six millimeters per year.

The production equipment, production process, and operating technology of seamless steel pipes are relatively complex. From tube blank to finished product, it goes through more than a dozen processes. In order to master the technology as soon as possible, the factory leadership sent workers to Shanghai to study. They only took three months to basically master all the production techniques that originally took eight months to learn.

    华南揭开大量生产无缝钢管序幕
    广州建成无缝钢管车间
    新华社广州24日电　广州钢铁厂无缝钢管车间已经建成。22日晚上，它轧出了第一根外径八十毫米、厚八毫米、长一点五五米的毛管；毛管经过加工以后，即可成为无缝钢管。从此，华南大量生产无缝钢管的序幕揭开了。
    这个车间的生产过程绝大部分是机械化的，每年能生产五毫米到七十六毫米的无缝钢管一万五千吨以上。
    无缝钢管的生产设备、生产过程和操作技术，都比较复杂，由管坯到成品要经过十几个工序。为了尽快地掌握技术，这个厂的领导方面曾经派出工人到上海学习。他们只用三个月的时间，就把原来需要8个月时间才能学到的全部生产技术基本上掌握起来。
