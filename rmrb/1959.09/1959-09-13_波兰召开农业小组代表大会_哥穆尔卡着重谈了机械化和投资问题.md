Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw Electric Dispatch: The First All-Poland Agricultural Group Delegates' Congress was held in Warsaw from September 3rd to 5th.

    Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee First Secretary Gomulka, Central Political Bureau member Ochab, Polish United Peasants' Party Central Committee Chairman Ignar, and others attended the Delegates' Congress.

    The congress heard Ochab's report on the tasks and role of agricultural groups, as well as the report on the activities of agricultural groups by the Central Organizational Committee Chairman of the Federation of Agricultural Groups, Ilczuk. The congress delegates also conducted extensive discussions on these two reports. They expressed their full support for the current agricultural policies of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government.

    In his report, Ochab said that in recent years, the Polish countryside has established organizational forms such as agricultural groups and agricultural production cooperatives. The Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish United Peasants' Party support agricultural groups and also support agricultural production cooperatives.

    He pointed out that we are now and will continue to be concerned with agricultural production cooperatives, which pave the way for new socialist relations in the countryside. We will expand our assistance to agricultural production cooperatives in the future, because agricultural production cooperatives are the vanguard of new and advanced forms in the countryside. We believe that in order to work together and achieve greater production achievements, it is particularly significant to develop voluntary mass organizations that organize individual farmers.

    Gomulka spoke on the last day of the meeting. He focused on the issues of agricultural investment and agricultural mechanization. He said that it is necessary to accumulate funds to collectively purchase the machinery necessary for agriculture. If we expect farmers to voluntarily accumulate funds, this process will continue for many years, and will cause the machinery to fall into the hands of wealthy farmers, that is, to exploit the majority of less affluent farmers. Therefore, despite the need for investment in other areas, we have decided to allocate the difference between the prices of agricultural products obligatorily sold by farmers and the market prices to a fund for the development of agriculture, thereby completing the task of agricultural mechanization.

    Gomulka pointed out that in order to rationally use this fund, a mass social organization such as an agricultural group is needed. With the assistance of agricultural groups, the state can engage more in agricultural planning and master correct investment policies. Collective ownership of machinery will give agricultural groups a socialist content.

    In a resolution adopted by the Delegates' Congress, it was pointed out that the basis of the new agricultural policy principles is to create social, political, economic, and technological conditions conducive to liberating and giving full play to the enthusiasm of farmers, maximizing agricultural production, thereby improving the living standards of the countryside and all the people.

    波兰召开农业小组代表大会
    哥穆尔卡着重谈了机械化和投资问题
    据新华社华沙电　第一届全波农业小组代表大会9月3日至5日在华沙举行。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡、中央政治局委员奥哈布，波兰统一农民党中央委员会主席伊格纳尔等出席了代表大会。
    大会听取了奥哈布作的关于农业小组的任务和作用的报告，以及农业小组联合会中央组织委员会主席伊尔楚克作的关于农业小组的活动的报告。大会代表并且就这两个报告进行了广泛的讨论。他们表示完全支持波兰统一工人党和政府的现行农业政策。
    奥哈布在报告中说，最近几年来，波兰农村建立了像农业小组和农业生产合作社这样一些组织形式。波兰统一工人党和波兰统一农民党支持农业小组，也支持农业生产合作社。
    他指出，我们现在和将来都要关心为农村新的社会主义关系铺平道路的农业生产合作社。我们今后要扩大对农业生产合作社的帮助，因为农业生产合作社是农村新的高级形式的开路先锋。我们认为，为了共同努力，取得更大的生产成就，发展把个体农民组织起来的自愿的群众性组织具有特殊意义。
    哥穆尔卡在最后一天会议上讲了话。他着重谈到了农业投资和农业机械化的问题。他说，必须积累资金来集体购置农业所必需的机器。如果指望农民自愿积累资金，这个过程要继续许多年，而且会使机器落入富裕农户手中，也就是说要使大部分不富裕的农民受到剥削。因此，尽管其他方面也需要投资，但是，我们仍然决定把从农民交纳的农产品义务交售价格和市场价格当中所取得的差价部分，拨作发展农业的基金，从而完成农业机械化的任务。
    哥穆尔卡指出，为了合理地使用这笔资金，需要有像农业小组这样的一个群众性的社会组织。在农业小组的协助下，国家可以更多地从事农业计划工作和掌握正确的投资政策。机器为集体所有将使农业小组具有社会主义的内容。
    代表大会在通过的一项决议中指出，新农业政策原则的基础是：创造有利于解放和发挥农民积极性的社会、政治、经济和技术条件，最大限度地提高农业生产，从而提高农村和全体人民的生活水平。
