    Fountain of Fire
    ——Stone Hill Poetry Drafts	Gu Gong
      Fountain of Fire
        (Written by the side of the converter furnace)
    Columns of fire surge into the sky,
    Clusters of sparks fly everywhere,
    Ah! What I see here!
    Is one fountain of fire after another!
    Though Pearl Spring is beautiful,
    And Baotu Spring is a wonder,
    How can they compare to a fountain of fire,
    That makes people leap with joy,
    And fills hearts with delight.
    The fountain of fire echoes the grand aspirations of the motherland,
    The fountain of fire whispers tales of happiness,
    The fountain sprays forth a bright future,
    The fountain sprays forth an everlasting spring.
      Charming Picture
    [Written by the blast furnace]
    Having traveled to famous mountains and great rivers,
    Having seen precious plants and exotic flowers,
    What I love the most,
    Are these iron towers one after another.
    Clouds and smoke swirl around the tower tops,
    Molten iron roars below the towers,
    Red-brown ore piles up like mountains,
    Forming a charming picture.
    Let this picture cover the motherland,
    Let this picture be hung everywhere,
    This brand new scene,
    Will replace ancient temples,
    And be known throughout the world!
      Echoes of Joy
    Everyone gazing at Beijing,
    Experiences various kinds of excitement,
    Some stare blankly at the glazed tiles,
    Some are lost in thought looking at the red flag…
    We steel and iron workers,
    Love to see thick smoke rising the most,
    We walk the streets of Beijing,
    And hear echoes of joy everywhere.
    How many steel pipes are swirling underground,
    All cast by our hands;
    How many divine eagles are speeding through the sky,
    Our labor is also in the cabins.
    Everyone gazing at Beijing,
    Experiences various kinds of excitement;
    We who sweat by the furnace,
    Have even more boiling heroic passion!

    火的喷泉
    ——石景山诗草	顾工
      火的喷泉
        （写于转钢炉边）一
    根根火柱冲天，
    一簇簇火花飞溅，
    啊！我在这里看到！
    一个个火的喷泉！
    珍珠泉虽然美丽，
    趵突泉可算奇观，
    可是怎能比得上火的喷泉，
    这样使人雀跃，
    使人心欢。
    火的喷泉震响祖国的豪语，
    火的喷泉传出幸福的呢喃，
    喷泉喷出灿烂的未来，
    喷泉喷出永不消逝的春天。
      迷人的图画
    〔写于高炉旁〕
    踏遍名山大川，
    看尽珍草奇花，
    但最最使我爱慕，
    还是这一座座铁塔。
    塔顶云烟缭绕，
    塔下铁水喧哗，
    赤褐色的矿石堆成山岳，
    组成一幅迷人的图画。
    让这图画布满祖国，
    让这图画到处悬挂，
    这崭新的景色，
    要代替古庙，
    闻名天下！
      欢乐的回声
    每个人眺望京城，
    都有各种不同兴奋，
    有人望着琉璃瓦发呆，
    有人望着红旗出神……
    我们炼钢炼铁的人，
    最喜爱看浓烟上升，
    我们走遍京城的街道，
    都听到欢乐的回声。
    地下回旋着多少钢管，
    都是我们的双手铸成；
    天空飞驰着多少神鹰，
    机舱里也有我们的劳动。
    每个人眺望京城，
    都有各种不同兴奋；
    我们在熔炉旁挥汗的人，
    豪迈的激情更沸腾！
