Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd. The workers on the capital's industrial front fought bravely on the first day of September and achieved initial success. According to incomplete statistics, 102 factories in the city, including the Jingxi Mining Bureau, Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, Maochang Steel Rolling Mill, Beijing First, Second, and Third Cotton Textile Factories, and Beijing Match Factory, completed or overfulfilled their production plans for the day.

On September 1st, a fervent atmosphere prevailed throughout the city's factories and enterprises, from the steelmaking furnaces where sparks flew to the mines underground, from the spinning and weaving workshops to the small and medium-sized factories producing daily necessities. The Jingxi Mining Bureau made comprehensive and detailed arrangements for September's production as early as late August. On the night of August 31st, many leading cadres went down into the mine for a final inspection. On the morning of the 1st, the early shift workers launched a major competition as soon as they entered the mine. The workers in each shift chased and surpassed each other while also cooperating. The retreating workers proactively sent the removed props to the tunneling workers, saving the tunneling workers' material transportation time and improving tunneling efficiency. Each mine section chief, assistant, and workshop union chairman went down into the mine to work alongside the workers, enabling timely resolution of problems that arose temporarily at the workface. Cadres from the office went down into the mine to help the workers push carts and transport materials. Employees of the material supply department went down into the mine to proactively understand the needs of each workface and deliver materials to the mine in a timely manner. On the 1st, the entire mining bureau produced 17,841 tons of coal, overfulfilling the daily plan by 5.62%, an increase of 18.95% compared to the average daily output in August. On September 1st, leading cadres of the Beijing Match Factory helped the No. 2 workshop, which produces matchsticks, solve the problem of production imbalance between processes, breaking through the weak link. As a result, the factory's output on this day increased by 4% compared to the average daily output in August.

    首都九月旗开得胜
    一百零二个厂在第一天完成和超额完成生产计划
    新华社2日讯　9月第一天，首都工业战线上的职工英勇奋战，旗开得胜。据不完全统计，全市有京西矿务局、北京电子管厂、茂昌轧钢厂、北京第一、二、三棉纺织厂、北京市火柴厂等一百零二个工厂完成或超额完成了当天的生产计划。
    9月1日，全市各个工厂企业，从火花飞溅的炼钢炉旁到矿山井下，从纺纱织布车间到生产日用工业品的中小工厂，到处热情沸腾。京西矿务局早在8月下旬就对9月份的生产作了全面细致的安排，8月31日深夜，许多领导干部又到井下进行最后一次检查。1日清晨，早班工人一下井就开展了大竞赛。各班工人你追我赶，又互相协作。回采工人主动把撤下的支柱送给掘进工人，节省了掘进工人的运料时间，提高了掘进效率。各矿段长、助理和车间工会主席都下井和工人一同干活，使工作面临时发生的问题得到及时解决。科室干部下井帮助工人推车、运料。材料供应部门的职工到井下主动了解各工作面的需要，把材料及时送到井下。1日，全矿务局产煤一万七千八百四十一吨，超额5.62％完成了日计划，比8月份平均日产量提高18.95％。北京市火柴厂的领导干部，1日帮助生产火柴梗的二车间解决工序间生产不平衡的问题，突破了薄弱环节，结果，全厂这一天的产量比8月份平均日产量增长4％。
