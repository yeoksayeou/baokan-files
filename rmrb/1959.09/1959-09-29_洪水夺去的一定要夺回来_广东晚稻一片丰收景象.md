Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th. The 35 million mu of late rice in Guangdong Province is growing very well. If there are no unexpected disasters before the harvest begins at the end of October, a bumper harvest is expected. Now, the vast number of commune members are adding to the splendor, fighting a great battle for the late-stage field management of late rice, striving to harvest dozens or hundreds of extra catties per mu.

This year, Guangdong planted 2 million mu more of late rice than last year. Because the transplanting was one solar term earlier than last year, and the close planting was more reasonable, the weather was favorable for the late rice after transplanting. Especially since August, after opposing rightism and boosting morale, the late rice was cultivated and topdressed in a timely manner, so tillering was rapid, averaging about 250,000 seedlings per mu. At present, except for the more than 1 million mu of late rice in the Shantou area, which is growing poorly due to the impact of typhoons, the rest has grown to more than one meter high, with thick stems and strong leaves. Most of the rice has already reached the round stem and grain filling stage, and a small portion is heading and flowering. The growth of late rice in various regions is more balanced and better than last year. The first-class seedlings account for more than half of the total area, and the third-class seedlings account for less than 10%.

Inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and seeing the scene of a bumper harvest of late rice, the ambition of the people in the rural areas of Guangdong is even greater, and their enthusiasm is even higher. They actively launched a movement to accumulate fertilizer and topdress, strengthen the ears and attack the grains, and strive for large ears with many grains and plump grains for each seedling. At present, the province has invested more than 4.5 million laborers in fertilizer accumulation alone, accounting for 30% of the rural labor force. An average of more than 80 piculs of quick-acting fertilizer has been applied to each mu of rice field. At the same time, late-stage field management work such as preventing lodging, eliminating diseases and insect pests, and exterminating rats has been launched.

In the decisive battle of late-stage field management, cadres and the masses in various places are competing in redness, diligence, and skill. Cadres at all levels are going deep into the fields and taking the lead in hard work. People's communes in various places are promoting the spirit of cooperation in the competition. Under the unified leadership of the commune party committees, they organize large-scale cooperation based on the principle of equivalent exchange. Through mutual competition and cooperative support, many previously backward production teams have caught up with the advanced production teams, which has greatly promoted the balanced development of late-stage field management.

    洪水夺去的一定要夺回来
    广东晚稻一片丰收景象
    据新华社广州28日电　广东省三千五百万亩晚稻长势非常好，10月底开始收割前如无意外灾害，可望特大丰收。现在，广大社员正在锦上添花，大战晚稻后期田间管理，为每亩多收几十斤、一百斤而战。
    今年广东晚稻比去年多种了二百万亩，由于插秧比去年提前了一个节令，密植更合理，晚稻插秧后风调雨顺，特别是从8月份以来经过反右倾、鼓干劲，晚稻中耕、追肥及时，因此分蘖很快，每亩已平均达到二十五万苗左右。目前，除了汕头专区一百多万亩晚稻因受到台风袭击的影响长势较差以外，其余都已长到一米多高，长得秆粗叶壮，大部分已圆秆孕穗，少部分正在抽穗扬花。各个专区晚稻生长比起去年来还要平衡，还要好看，一类禾占到了总面积的一半以上，三类禾不到10％。
    在党的八届八中全会精神的鼓舞下，看到晚稻一片丰收景象，广东农村人民群众的雄心更大，干劲更足。他们积极展开积肥追肥运动，壮穗攻粒，力争苗苗穗大粒多，粒粒丰满。全省目前仅投入积肥的劳动力就达四百五十多万人，占农村劳动力的30％。平均每亩稻田已增施了八十多担速效肥料。与此同时，并展开了防止倒伏、除治病虫害和灭鼠等后期田间管理工作。
    在后期田间管理的决战中，各地干部和群众人人比红、比勤、比巧，各级干部深入田头带头苦战。各地人民公社在竞赛中大兴协作之风，在公社党委的统一领导下，根据等价交换的原则组织大协作。通过互相竞赛和协作支援，许多原来后进的生产队已赶上了先进的生产队，大大促进了后期田间管理工作的平衡发展。
