Hold High the Red Flag and Vigorously Launch Water Conservancy Movement
Li Baohua, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy and Electric Power

Water conservancy construction is a great struggle to transform nature. In this struggle, hundreds of millions of people must seize the initiative from nature and transform themselves from slaves of nature into masters of nature. This is an indispensable condition for promoting the modernization of agriculture in our country. This great struggle was unimaginable in old China. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the socialist system, it must be realized. Holding high the red flag of the General Line, the red flag of the Great Leap Forward, and the red flag of the People's Commune, and vigorously launching mass movements, we will surely win victory.

The experience of the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic proves this point. From 1949 to 1959, in a short span of ten years, the Chinese people experienced a great historical era. In terms of water conservancy construction, over the past ten years, with the victorious development of the socialist revolution, the Chinese people have initially transformed the landscape with their own laboring hands. In total, 60 large reservoirs with a storage capacity of over 100 million cubic meters, more than 4 million medium and small reservoirs and canals, more than 120,000 kilometers of dikes, more than 15 million ponds and dams, and more than 10 million wells have been built. The total amount of earth and stone work completed was more than 80 billion cubic meters, using more than 40 billion labor days. As a result of the above projects, the national irrigated area has increased from 240 million mu in 1949 to about 1 billion mu, accounting for more than 60% of the total cultivated land area; the national area initially controlled for soil erosion has reached 600,000 square kilometers, accounting for 40% of the total soil erosion area; the area of low-lying waterlogged areas initially improved is 210 million mu, accounting for 55% of the area of easily waterlogged cultivated land; and rural hydropower has developed to 150,000 kilowatts. The tremendous development of water conservancy construction has played a significant role in agricultural production. In 1958, the total grain output reached 500 billion jin, completing the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding them. This year, our country's north and south were hit by severe floods, and the vast areas of the central region were hit by particularly severe droughts. However, inspired by the General Line, relying on the large number of water conservancy projects built over the years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, and relying on the People's Communes, large-scale large-corps operations and large-scale collaborative support were organized. The Chinese people won an unprecedented victory in the flood prevention and drought resistance struggle, not only greatly reducing the affected area and mitigating the degree of disaster, but also being able to guarantee a continued bumper harvest in agriculture this year on the basis of last year's bumper harvest.

The achievements and development speed of water conservancy construction in our country have never been seen in history. In terms of developing irrigation, the irrigated area increased by 760 million mu in ten years, of which 480 million mu were increased in 1958 alone, twice the irrigation area accumulated over thousands of years before liberation. Marx's prediction that one day is equal to twenty years has been verified in water conservancy. Take Henan Province as an example. In 1942 before liberation, Henan suffered a severe summer drought, resulting in thousands of miles of red land, agricultural failure, and large-scale displacement and death of people. This year, the severity of the summer drought in Henan was even more severe than in 1942, but due to the construction of a large number of water conservancy projects and the adoption of various temporary drought-resistant measures, the more than 80 million mu of farmland affected by the drought generally received varying degrees of irrigation, and now a bumper harvest of grain and cotton is in sight, and the people live and work in peace and contentment. In terms of river management, over the past ten years we have initially curbed severe floods and begun the fundamental management of the Huai River, Yellow River, Hai River, Liao River, and Han River. Take the Yellow River as an example. Before liberation, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Yellow River breached its banks an average of more than three times a year. Among them, the great flood in 1933 breached more than 50 times, inundating 11,000 square kilometers of land and affecting more than 3.64 million people. After liberation, the Yellow River dikes have won the battle against floods and celebrated peace and tranquility every year. In 1958, the Yellow River experienced a flood similar to that in 1933, and no breaches occurred anywhere in the river; the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub, built to fundamentally control the Yellow River, has already played a partial role in flood control this year and will control floods next year; on both banks of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, irrigation canals have been opened, irrigating 14.89 million mu of farmland. The Yellow River, once a symbol of disaster for our country, will soon become a symbol of happiness for our people.

The achievements and development speed of water conservancy construction in our country have never been seen in capitalist countries. Take the United States as an example. In 1939, the national irrigated area of the United States was 129.08 million mu, and in 1955 it was 159.29 million mu, an increase of 30.21 million mu in sixteen years. The increase in irrigated area in China in 1958 alone was equivalent to sixteen times the increase in irrigated area in the United States in sixteen years.

Why can we achieve such large-scale and rapid development in water conservancy construction? We believe that there are three fundamental reasons. First, take the mass line as the fundamental ideology for carrying out water conservancy work, and under this ideology, establish the "three main" policy, relying on the broad masses to vigorously launch water conservancy movements. Second, inspired by the General Line, oppose right-leaning, encourage hard work, strive for the upper reaches, and launch a great leap forward in water conservancy movements. Third, rely on the People's Communes to push water conservancy movements to a higher stage. The above three points are impossible for all capitalist countries to achieve. Imperialism fears our victory and has exhausted all its vicious tricks to slander and defame our General Line, Great Leap Forward, and People's Communes. Right-leaning opportunists act as echoes of imperialism and are also carrying out various rumors and attacks, attempting to shake people's hearts. The water conservancy Great Leap Forward was the vanguard of last year's comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and right-leaning opportunists often use water conservancy as an example to attack the General Line, Great Leap Forward, and People's Communes. In order to better arm ourselves, smash the attacks of right-leaning opportunists, we need to further summarize and elaborate on these fundamental experiences from the water conservancy aspect, and thoroughly criticize the erroneous views that are opposed to them.

First, take the mass line as the fundamental ideology for carrying out water conservancy work, implement the "three main" policy, and vigorously launch water conservancy movements.

Marxists have always believed that in class struggle, the people can only liberate themselves by relying on themselves; similarly, in the struggle against nature, the people can only liberate themselves by relying on themselves. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always taught us with this Marxist truth, making us realize that the mass line is the fundamental line of all work. Not only must the socialist revolution be realized through mass movements, but socialist construction must also be completed through mass movements. The fundamental dividing line between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois revolutionaries is the attitude towards mass movements.

From the perspective of water conservancy work, the object of water conservancy work is the vast land of our country's 9.6 million square kilometers, and the thousands of mountains and rivers on this land. Two fundamentally different lines are placed before water conservancy workers. Proletarian revolutionaries believe that in order to comprehensively and thoroughly solve flood and drought disasters and comprehensively develop water and soil resources, it is necessary to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to widely manage mountains and rivers in their own land, from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, from the source of the river to the tail of the river, to intercept, store, control, and utilize water step by step after rainwater falls to the ground, turning water hazards into water benefits. According to such requirements, the water management policy must be the "three main" policy of storing water as the main thing, small-scale projects as the main thing, and self-management by the masses as the main thing. Bourgeois revolutionaries, because they dare not rely on the masses to manage water, cannot use extensive small-scale projects as the foundation of water conservancy, but can only rely on a small number of people to run a very small number of large-scale projects. In this way, they cannot fully control and utilize water sources and implement the spirit of storing water as the main thing. Therefore, whether or not to dare to rely on the masses is also the fundamental dividing line between proletarian and bourgeois ideas in water conservancy work.

Right-leaning opportunists are attacking water conservancy movements with these bourgeois viewpoints. They regard politics and technology as absolutely opposed to each other. They believe that water conservancy is a technical work and cannot be led by politics, let alone engage in mass movements, otherwise water conservancy will be ruined and chaotic. They do not understand that the advantage of engaging in mass movements is that it can best solve technical problems, create advanced experiences, and promote the emergence of new technologies. Through mass movements, the broad masses have mastered water conservancy technology. In this way, water conservancy technology can rapidly grow, bloom the most beautiful flowers, and bear the most beautiful fruits on the broadest mass basis. Water conservancy work since the Great Leap Forward has fully proved this point. The mountain management experience created by the masses in Shanxi and Henan provinces, the experience of self-flowing irrigation networks in mountainous and hilly areas created by the masses in Gansu and Hubei provinces, the experience of river networkization in plain areas created by the masses in Anhui Province, the experience of transforming low-lying areas created by the masses in Hebei Province, the experience of various types of small and medium-sized water conservancy engineering structures designed by the masses in various places, and the experience of tool innovation created in large-scale construction, are these not the most precious things that cannot be written in water conservancy textbooks? After the broad masses of people launched a large-scale movement to build small-scale water conservancy projects in the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, they immediately launched a movement to extensively build high-quality and large-scale large and medium-sized backbone projects last winter and this spring. Is this not the fastest speed of development of water conservancy technology? A water conservancy army composed of hundreds of millions of peasants, millions of peasant technicians, tens of thousands of intellectual scientists and technicians, and hundreds of thousands of party and government leading cadres, is this not the largest technical team in history? All these show that only by putting politics in command and vigorously launching mass movements can water conservancy technology leap forward on the broad road of Marxism.

Second, inspired by the General Line, oppose right-leaning, encourage hard work, strive for the upper reaches, and launch a great leap forward in water conservancy movements.

Our water conservancy cause is not only something that predecessors have never done, but also many are difficult undertakings to transform nature that predecessors have never even thought of. Without the guiding ideology of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results," how can we have the courage to make high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way? Proletarian revolutionaries not only want to know the world, but also want to transform the world, so they have the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Due to the limitations of their class, bourgeois revolutionaries are only willing to maintain the status quo and dare not know the world, let alone transform the world.

In the process of transforming nature, difficulties will inevitably be encountered constantly. Is it to bow our heads in the face of difficulties, stop moving forward, and be content with staying in the lower reaches? Or is it to break through difficulties, resolutely move forward, and strive for the upper reaches? This is the dividing line between the General Line and right-leaning conservative thinking, and it is also the dividing line between proletarian and bourgeois thinking. Facts have proved that if we do not constantly oppose right-leaning and oppose conservatism, the water conservancy movement will not be able to move forward even one step.

In one year, countless fish scale pits must be dug on thousands of mountain tops, ditch and canal network projects must be dug on vast plains, thousands of small and medium-sized reservoirs must be completed, and dozens of large reservoirs must control floods. These seemingly impossible things have been successfully accomplished. This proves that the "upper reaches" do exist objectively. As long as we oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and go all out, the people can complete water conservancy construction in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and it is possible to create miracles. However, right-leaning opportunists turn a blind eye to the thousands of successful facts, and only seize on the very few shortcomings and accidents, attacking one point without considering the rest. They see that individual channels have not yet been completed, and they shout loudly, saying that many projects have no effect; they see that individual projects have accidents, and they shout loudly, saying that water conservancy has become a water disaster. What else can this explain besides that they are deliberately opposing the General Line?

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that morale can be boosted but not dampened. We must treat mass movements with full enthusiasm and let cadres and the masses do things boldly, learn lessons in the process of doing things, and increase their talents. Water conservancy is a great struggle to transform mountains and rivers and fight against the earth. People's understanding of natural laws can only be gradually enriched and improved in practice. Some projects encounter some setbacks during the construction process, and some projects need to be constantly repaired and improved after completion. This is a very natural process in this great struggle. After the water conservancy upsurge in 1956 in our country, a countercurrent of anti-adventurism occurred in 1957. Some people exaggerated and attacked some shortcomings in the water conservancy upsurge, severely dampening the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and causing the water conservancy movement to fall into a low tide. Now right-leaning opportunists are once again violating Chairman Mao's teachings, disregarding historical lessons, and after the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they are seizing on individual shortcomings in an attempt to pour cold water on the masses and push the water conservancy movement into a low tide once again. This is a criminal act against the mass movement and is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

Third, rely on the People's Communes to push water conservancy movements to a higher stage.

Marxists have always believed that the great cause of mankind transforming nature can never be completed in class society; only under the socialist and communist systems can the people exert the greatest power and become the true and conscious masters of nature for the first time. Therefore, only by adhering to carrying out the socialist revolution to the end and actively supporting the sprouts of communism can the water conservancy movement continue to develop and advance. The history of water conservancy development over the past ten years proves this point.

In the past nine years, with the victory of land reform, the development of mutual aid and cooperation, and the completion of advanced agricultural cooperatives, the social productive forces of our country have been liberated step by step, and the scale of water conservancy movements has expanded more and more. In 1958, after the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy and agriculture, in order to achieve a greater leap forward in agriculture, it was necessary to completely overcome flood and drought disasters and comprehensively develop water and land resources. This requires: carrying out comprehensive planning of water conservancy and land resources on a larger scale than agricultural cooperatives; further building large and medium-sized backbone projects on the basis of continuing to build small-scale water conservancy projects on a large scale; connecting scattered and isolated projects into complete water conservancy systems; accelerating the improvement of the mechanization level of water conservancy; ... and so on. However, advanced agricultural cooperatives cannot meet this requirement. In order to solve the above problems, small cooperatives were generally merged into large cooperatives in various places, and communist large-scale collaboration was generally developed. However, these methods cannot completely solve the contradictions. At this moment, the People's Commune emerged as the times require. As soon as the People's Commune was established, it showed its unparalleled superiority in solving water conservancy problems.

With the People's Commune, the planning problem can be better solved. The People's Commune is generally equivalent to a district or several districts. Its land is large and very suitable for becoming the basic unit of water conservancy planning. In each People's Commune, the development of small rivers can be comprehensively planned, the water conservancy system can be arranged in a unified manner, and agricultural areas, pastoral areas, forest areas, and aquaculture areas can be rationally arranged. With such a suitable basic unit for water conservancy planning, not only can every piece of land and every small ditch be more fully utilized, but also the river basin planning of large rivers has gained a new and powerful foundation. Before the establishment of the Yingju People's Commune in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, water conservancy projects were not complete enough, and the layout of canals was not completely rational. After the establishment of the commune, under comprehensive planning and unified action, the river networkization was basically realized in one year, which played a huge role in this year's struggle to resist drought and ensure a bumper harvest. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have developed comprehensively, and the atmosphere has been completely renewed.

With the People's Commune, medium-sized backbone projects can be widely built. On the basis of small-scale projects, medium-sized backbone projects must be built in order to control the floods of small and medium-sized rivers and replenish the water sources of small-scale projects. However, medium-sized projects are large in scale and benefit a wide area, making it relatively difficult to be run by agricultural cooperatives. With the establishment of the People's Commune, this problem is well solved. The benefited area of medium-sized projects is generally within the scope of a commune, and the People's Commune is fully capable of running them, which greatly promotes the development of medium-sized projects. In total, during the nine years before communization, 717 medium-sized reservoirs were built nationwide, with a storage capacity of 10.3 billion cubic meters; during the one year after communization, 1,078 medium-sized reservoirs were built nationwide, with a storage capacity of 20.8 billion cubic meters, twice that before communization.

With the People's Commune, the construction speed of large-scale water conservancy can be accelerated. In order to control the floods of large rivers and replenish the water sources of medium-sized projects, large-scale backbone projects must be built. With the People's Commune, more migrant workers can be mobilized to go to the construction site, while production in the rear is not affected, which greatly accelerates the construction speed of large-scale projects. The Miyun Reservoir was built by 19 counties in Hebei Province and Beijing, concentrating 200,000 migrant workers, working for one year, and agriculture in the rear still guaranteed a bumper harvest. This would not have been possible without the People's Commune. In the Hai River basin, the Guanting Reservoir was built in the nine years before communization. In the one year after communization, six large reservoirs, including Miyun, Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Xidayang, Wangkuai, and Hengshanling, were used to control floods.

With the People's Commune, a relatively strong water conservancy system can be formed for unified management and rational dispatch. In the past, in advanced agricultural cooperatives, only small-scale water conservancy systems could be formed. In the People's Commune, these scattered and isolated small-scale systems can be linked together, and a unified system can be formed with medium-sized projects as the backbone. In Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, the irrigated area was more than 200,000 mu before communization; after communization, a "long vine melon" water conservancy network was built, and the irrigated area developed to 310,000 mu. This year, during the period when rice was budding and pregnant, the drought lasted for more than 40 days. Thanks to the water conservancy network, large and small reservoirs released water in a timely manner and irrigated in a unified manner, guaranteeing a bumper harvest.

With the People's Commune, the speed of water conservancy mechanization can be accelerated. The public accumulation of the commune can be used to purchase water pumps and light construction machinery, and commune-run enterprises can produce local cement, local iron, local steel, and local machinery. These are not easy for agricultural cooperatives to do, which greatly promotes the mechanization of water conservancy. An'guo County, Hebei Province, purchased more than 500 water pumps in the nine years before communization, and more than 700 water pumps in the one year after communization, which is a clear proof.

It is precisely because of the above advantages that the People's Commune, with the majestic posture of a newborn giant, has pushed the water conservancy movement to a higher stage in a short year. From the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, advanced agricultural cooperatives built thousands of small-scale projects, developing an irrigated area of 480 million mu, laying the foundation for the water conservancy Great Leap Forward. From the autumn of 1958 to the present, on this basis, the People's Commune has built unprecedented medium-sized and large-scale backbone projects, purchased a large number of water conservancy machinery, and strengthened unified management, which has greatly improved the standards of the original water conservancy facilities and strengthened the ability to resist flood and drought disasters. Under the attack of this year's severe flood and drought disasters, the People's Commune enabled the water conservancy projects of the past ten years to play their greatest role and organized large corps to rush to build a batch of new projects. It is this newborn giant who fought with the earth with infinite power and defended the bumper harvest. The masses in Henan Province praised the commune and said: "We are not afraid of the sky, we are not afraid of the earth, we have the commune to protect us." This is the fair evaluation of the commune by the people.

Faced with such historical facts, right-leaning opportunists are shouting loudly, saying that the commune was established too early and too quickly. This only shows that they do not understand the basic views of Marxism on historical development, do not understand the specific conditions of our country's social history, and do not understand the thoughts and feelings of our people in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Faced with the laughter of the broad masses, right-leaning opportunists are crying and weeping, saying that the commune was established wrongly and collapsed. What else can this explain besides that they oppose the continued development of the socialist revolution from the bourgeois standpoint?

Contrary to the right-leaning opportunists, the broad masses have seen from the great victory of the People's Commune in the past year that the ideal of "no disaster from heavy rain, and a guaranteed bumper harvest without rain," and the beautiful prospect of "terracing slopes, river networkization of plains, reservoirization of gullies and terraces, terracing of river channels, systematization of projects, gardening of cultivated land, mechanization of water lifting, electrification of hydropower, diversification of aquaculture, and greening of barren mountains, barren slopes, and surrounding areas" will surely be realized through the People's Commune.

The achievements of water conservancy construction in the past ten years are tremendous, but we are by no means satisfied with the achievements we have already made. At present, more than one-third of the country's cultivated land does not have irrigation facilities; the disaster resistance capacity of some of the existing projects is still relatively low. Large areas of saline-alkali depressions and soil erosion areas remain to be治理。 The fundamental work of治理 the Yellow River has just begun, and the basin management work of the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Heilongjiang River is being planned. Even the Huai River and Hai River, which were治理 earlier, will have a lot of work to do in the future. The comprehensive治理 of small and medium-sized rivers, the construction of rural hydropower, and the comprehensive development of water conservancy resources, as well as the south-to-north water transfer and the fundamental治理 of deserts, have only just begun in some cases, and are still being studied in others. In terms of the needs of our great motherland, our water conservancy cause is not being办得 too much, but needs to be办得 even more; not being办得 too fast, but needs to be办得 even faster. Therefore, in the next few years, we must resolutely oppose right-leaning, encourage hard work, and continue to办 water conservancy on a larger, faster, better, and more economical scale.

The slander and attacks of domestic and foreign reactionaries and some right-leaning opportunists on our country's water conservancy construction are futile. Under the combat call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning and encourage hard work, hundreds of millions of people will launch a new water conservancy upsurge this winter and next spring. This will be another vigorous mass movement and another Great Leap Forward. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic Chinese people, holding high the red flag of the General Line, the red flag of the Great Leap Forward, and the red flag of the People's Commune, are determined to overcome the earth and establish a strong country. No force can stop us from moving from victory to greater victory!

    高举红旗，大搞水利运动
    水利电力部副部长　李葆华
    水利建设是一项改造自然的伟大斗争。在这场斗争中，亿万人民要从自然手里夺取主动权，使自己从自然的奴隶，变为自然的主人。这是促进我国农业现代化不可缺少的一个条件。这个伟大的斗争，在旧中国是无法设想的。但是在共产党领导下，在社会主义的制度下，就必需实现，高举着总路线的红旗，大跃进的红旗，人民公社的红旗，大搞群众运动，就一定能够赢得胜利。
    建国十年的经验，证明了这一点。从1949年到1959年，在短短的十年中，中国人民经历了一个伟大的历史时代。在水利建设方面，十年来随着社会主义革命的胜利发展，中国人民用自己劳动的双手，初步使山河改观。十年总计修建蓄水一亿立米以上的大型水库六十座，中小水库和渠道四百多万处，整修堤防十二万多公里，兴修塘坝一千五百多万处，凿井一千多万眼，共完成土石方量八百多亿立方米，用劳动工日四百多亿个。由于以上工程，全国灌溉面积，已经由1949年的二点四亿亩增加到十亿亩左右，占耕地总面积的60％以上；全国初步控制水土流失的面积达到六十万平方公里，占水土流失总面积的40％；初步治理洼涝地区二点一亿亩，占易涝耕地面积的55％；并发展农村水电15万瓩。水利建设的巨大发展，对农业生产起到显著作用。1958年粮食总产量达到五千亿斤，提前超额完成了第二个五年计划的指标。今年我国北方和南方受到严重的洪水袭击，中部广大地区更受到特大旱灾的袭击。但是在总路线的鼓舞下，依靠历年特别是大跃进以来兴修的大量水利工程，依靠人民公社，组织了大规模的大兵团作战和大协作支援，我国人民在防汛抗旱斗争中夺取了史无前例的胜利，不仅大大缩小了受灾的面积和减轻了受灾程度。而且仍然可以在去年的大丰收的基础上保证今年农业的继续丰收。
    水利建设的成就和发展速度是我国历史上所从来不曾有过的。在发展灌溉方面，十年间共增加灌溉面积七点六亿亩，其中1958年一年就增加了四点八亿亩，为解放前几千年所累积完成的灌溉面积的二倍，马克思关于一天等于二十年的预言，在水利方面得到了验证。以河南省为例。解放前的1942年，河南夏季大旱，结果是赤地千里，农业失收，人民大批流离和死亡。今年，河南夏季大旱的程度比1942年还要严重，但由于兴修了大量水利工程，采取了各项临时抗旱措施，受旱的八千多万亩农田，普遍得到不同程度的灌溉，现在粮棉丰收在望，人民安居乐业。在江河治理方面，十年来我们初步制止了严重的洪水泛滥，开始了对淮河、黄河、海河、辽河与汉江的根本治理。以黄河为例，解放前在国民党反动派统治期间，黄河平均每年决口三处以上，其中1933年大水决口五十余处，淹地一万一千平方公里，受灾人口三百六十四万余人。解放后黄河堤防年年战胜洪水欢庆安澜，1958年黄河发生与1933年相仿的洪水，全河没有发生一处决口；为根治黄河修建的三门峡水利枢纽，今年已经起了部分拦洪作用，明年即将拦洪；在黄河下游两岸，开辟了纵横灌渠，灌溉农田一千四百八十九万亩。作为我国灾难象征的黄河，将很快地变成我国人民幸福的象征了。
    我国水利建设的成就和发展速度，是资本主义国家从来所不曾有过的。以美国为例。美国1939年全国灌溉面积为一万二千九百零八万亩，1955年为一万五千九百二十九万亩，十六年间增加三千零二十一万亩。中国在1958年一年间增加的灌溉面积就相当于美国十六年所增加灌溉面积的十六倍。
    在水利建设上，为什么能取得规模这样大，速度这样快的成就呢？我们认为根本的原因有三条。第一，以群众路线作为开展水利工作的根本思想，在此思想下确立了“三主”方针，依靠广大群众大搞水利运动。第二，在总路线的鼓舞下，反右倾，鼓干劲，争上游，掀起水利运动的大跃进。第三，依靠人民公社，把水利运动推到更高的阶段。以上三条，是一切资本主义国家所不可能办到的。帝国主义害怕我们的胜利，用尽了一切恶毒心计，诽谤和污蔑我们的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。右倾机会主义分子做帝国主义的应声虫，也在进行各种造谣和攻击，妄图动摇人心。水利大跃进是去年全面大跃进的前锋，右倾机会主义分子常以水利为例，来攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社。为了更好地武装自己，粉碎右倾机会主义分子的进攻，我们有必要从水利方面进一步总结和阐述这些根本经验，并彻底批判与此对立的错误观点。
    第一、以群众路线作为开展水利工作的根本思想，贯彻“三主”方针，大搞水利运动。
    马克思主义者从来认为，在阶级斗争中，人民群众只有依靠自己才能解放自己；同样，在与自然的斗争中，人民群众也只有依靠自己才能解放自己。党中央和毛主席，一直以这条马克思主义的真理教导我们，使我们认识到，群众路线是一切工作的根本路线，不仅社会主义革命必须通过群众运动才能实现，社会主义建设同样也必须通过群众运动才能完成。以什么态度对待群众运动，这是无产阶级革命家和资产阶级革命家的根本分界线。
    从水利工作来说，水利工作的对象是我国九百六十万平方公里的广大土地，和在这土地上的千山万水。在水利工作者的面前摆着两条根本不同的路线。无产阶级的革命家认为：为了全面、彻底地解决水旱灾害，综合开发水土资源，就必需发动亿万人民，在自己所在的土地上，广泛地治山治水，从山顶治到山脚，从河源治到河尾，在雨水降到地面后，就节节拦蓄，节节控制，节节利用，使水害变成水利。根据这样的要求，治水方针必须是以蓄水为主，以小型为主，以群众自办为主的“三主”方针。资产阶级的革命家，由于他们不敢依靠群众治水，他们就不能以广泛的小型工程作为水利的基础，而只能依靠少数人办极少数的大型工程，这样他们也就不可能充分控制和利用水源，贯彻以蓄为主的精神。因此，敢不敢依靠群众，同样也是水利工作中无产阶级和资产阶级思想的根本分界线。
    右倾机会主义分子正是以这些资产阶级观点，攻击水利运动。他们把政治和技术看成绝对对立的东西。他们认为，水利是技术工作，不能政治挂帅，更不能搞群众运动，否则就把水利办坏了，办乱了。他们不懂得，搞群众运动的好处正是在于能够最好地解决技术问题。创造先进经验，促进新技术的出现，通过群众运动，广大群众掌握了水利技术。这样水利技术便能在最广泛的群众基础上，迅速成长，开出最美的花，结出最美的果。大跃进以来的水利工作完全证明了这一点。山西、河南等省群众创造的治山经验，甘肃、湖北等省群众创造的山区和丘陵区自流灌溉网的经验，安徽省群众创造的平原区河网化的经验，河北省群众创造的洼地改造的经验，各地群众设计的多种多样中小水利工程建筑物的经验，在大规模施工中创造的工具革新的经验，这些难道不是水利课本上所写不出的最珍贵的东西吗？广大群众，在1957年冬到1958年春开展了量多面广的兴修小型水利工程的运动后，紧接着在去冬今春又开展了一个以广泛兴修质量高、规模大的大中型骨干工程的运动，这难道不是水利技术发展的最快速度吗？以几亿农民群众、几百万农民技术员、几万知识分子科学技术人员和几十万党政领导干部组成的水利大军，这难道不是有史以来最大的技术队伍吗？所有这些都说明，只有政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，才能使水利技术在马克思主义的康庄大道上，飞跃前进。
    第二、在总路线的鼓舞下，反右倾，鼓干劲，争上游，掀起水利运动的大跃进。
    我们的水利事业不仅是前人所未曾做过，而且很多是前人所未曾想过的改造自然的艰巨事业。没有“鼓足干劲，力争上游”的指导思想，那能有勇气叫高山低头、河水让路？无产阶级革命家不仅要认识世界，而且要改造世界，因此就有敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。资产阶级革命家由于阶级的局限性，他们只愿维持现状，不敢认识世界，更不敢改造世界。
    在改造自然的过程中，总会不断遇到困难的。是在困难面前低头，停步不前呢，甘居下游呢？还是冲破困难，坚决前进，力争上游？这是总路线和右倾保守思想的分界线，也是无产阶级和资产阶级思想的分界线。事实证明，如果不是不断地反右倾，反保守，水利运动就一步也不能前进。
    在一年里，要在千万个山头上挖无数鱼鳞坑，要在广大平原上挖出沟渠纵横的河网工程，要完成千万座中小水库，要使几十座大型水库拦洪，这些看来似乎办不到的事，都胜利做成了。这证明客观上确实存在着“上游”，只要反掉右倾保守思想，鼓足干劲，人民就能多、快、好、省地完成水利建设，是能创造奇迹的。但是右倾机会主义者却闭眼不看千万件成功的事实，只是抓住极少数的缺点和事故，攻其一点，不及其余。他们看到个别渠道还没有修成，就大叫大嚷，说许多工程没有效果；他们看到个别工程出了事故，就大叫大嚷，说水利变成水害了。这除了说明他们别有用心地反对总路线以外，还能说明什么呢？
    毛主席一再教导我们，气可鼓不可泄，要以满腔热情的态度对待群众运动，要放手让干部和群众做，在做的中间得到教训，增长才干。水利是一项改造山河、向地球开战的伟大斗争。人民对自然规律的认识，只能在实践中逐渐丰富提高。有的工程在建设过程中，遭遇到若干挫折，有的工程在建成后，还要不断地修整改善，这本是这场伟大斗争中很自然的过程。我国在1956年水利高潮后，1957年发生反冒进的逆流，某些人夸大和攻击水利高潮中的若干缺点，严重打击了干部和群众的积极性，使水利运动落到低潮。现在右倾机会主义分子再一次违反毛主席的教导，不顾历史的教训，在1958年大跃进取得伟大胜利后，又抓住个别缺点，企图泼群众的冷水，将水利运动再一次压向低潮，这是对群众运动的罪恶行为，是中国人民所绝不能容忍的。
    第三、依靠人民公社把水利运动推到更高阶段。
    马克思主义者从来认为，人类改造自然的伟大事业，决不可能在阶级社会中完成；只有在社会主义和共产主义制度下，人民群众才能发挥最伟大的力量，才能第一次成为自然界的真正的和自觉的主宰。因此，只有坚持将社会主义革命进行到底，并且积极扶持共产主义的萌芽，才能使水利运动不断发展前进。十年来水利发展的历史，证明了这一点。
    在过去九年中，随着土地改革的胜利，互助合作的发展，高级合作化的完成，我国的社会生产力一步一步地解放，水利运动的规模也一次比一次更扩大。1958年，在水利和农业大跃进后，为了实现农业更大的跃进，必然要求彻底克服水旱灾害，全面开发水利和土地资源。这就要求：在比农业合作社更大的范围内，进行水利和土地的全面规划；在继续大办小型水利的基础上，进一步兴修大、中型的骨干工程；把分散的、孤立的工程联成完整的水利系统；更快地提高水利的机械化水平；……等等。但是高级农业合作社却不能满足这种要求。为了解决上述问题，各地普遍将小社并成大社，并且普遍地发展共产主义大协作。但是这些办法都不能彻底解决矛盾。就在这时，人民公社应运而生了。人民公社一经产生，就显示了它在解决水利问题方面的无比优越性。
    有了人民公社，就能更好地解决规划问题。人民公社一般相当于一个区或者几个区，它的土地大，很适宜成为水利规划的基本单位。在每个人民公社里，可以全面规划小河流的开发，可以统筹布置水利系统，可以合理安排农区、牧区、林区和水产区。水利规划有了这样一层适宜的基本单位，不仅使每块土地和每条小沟得到更充分的利用；并且使大江大河的流域规划也得到了新的有力的基础。河南省封丘县应举人民公社成立前，水利工程不够完备，渠道布置不完全合理。公社成立后，在全面规划，统一行动下，一年基本上实现了河网化，在今年抗旱保丰收的斗争中发挥巨大作用，农、林、牧、副、渔综合发展，气象一新。
    有了人民公社，就能广泛地修建中型骨干工程。在小型工程的基础上，必须修建中型骨干工程，才能控制中小河流的洪水，补给小型工程的水源。但是中型工程的规模大，受益广，由农业合作社举办比较困难。人民公社建立，这个问题就好解决了。中型工程的受益区一般在一个公社的范围内，人民公社完全有力举办，这就大大促进中型工程的发展。总计公社化前九年期间，全国修建中型水库七百一十七座，蓄水一百零三亿方；公社化后一年期间，全国修建中型水库一千零七十八座，蓄水二百零八亿方，为公社化前的两倍。
    有了人民公社，就能加快大型水利的建设速度。为了控制大江大河的洪水，补给中型工程的水源，必须修建大型骨干工程。有了人民公社，就能动员更多的民工上工地，同时后方不误生产，这就大大加快大型工程的建设速度。密云水库由河北省和北京市的十九个县出工，集中民工二十万，工作时间一年，后方农业仍然保证大丰收。如果没有人民公社，这是办不到的。在海河流域，公社化前九年修成了一座官厅水库，公社化后一年，使密云、岗南、黄壁庄、西大洋、王快、横山岭等六座大型水库拦洪。
    有了人民公社，就能组成比较强大的水利系统，统一管理，合理调度。在过去的高级农业合作社内，只能各成小型的水利系统。在人民公社内，就可以将这些分散的、孤立的小型系统互相联结，并且以中型为骨干，组成统一的系统。云南省玉溪县在公社化前灌溉面积二十多万亩；公社化后，修成“长藤结瓜”的水利网，灌溉面积发展到三十一万亩。今年正当稻谷含苞孕穗期间，旱象持续达四十余天，由于有了水利网，大小水库适时放水，统筹灌溉，保证了丰收。
    有了人民公社，就能加快水利机械化的速度。公社的公共积累可以购置抽水机和轻型的施工机械，社办企业可以造土水泥和土铁、土钢、土机械，这些都是农业合作社不易办到的，这就大大促进了水利的机械化。河北省安国县，公社化前九年置办抽水机五百多台，公社化后一年置办抽水机七百多台，就是一个明证。
    正是由于以上优越性，人民公社以新生巨人的雄姿，在短短一年间就把水利运动推到更高的阶段。1957年冬到1958年春，高级农业合作社修建了千万座小型工程，发展灌溉面积四点八亿亩，打下了水利大跃进的基础。从1958年秋到现在，人民公社在这个基础上修建了规模空前的中型和大型骨干工程，置办了大量的水利机械，加强了统一管理，这就大大提高了原有水利设施的标准，加强了抗御水旱灾害的能力。在今年特大水旱灾害的袭击下，人民公社使十年来的水利工程发挥了最大作用，并且组织大兵团突击兴修一批新的工程。正是这个新生的巨人，以无限威力和天地搏斗，保卫了丰收。河南省群众歌颂公社道：“天不怕，地不怕，咱有公社来保驾”。这就是人民群众对公社的公正评价。
    面对着这样的历史事实，右倾机会主义分子却在大叫大嚷说什么公社办早了，办快了。这只是说明，他们不懂得马克思主义关于历史发展的基本观点，不懂得我国社会历史的具体条件，更不懂得我国人民在1958年大跃进中的思想感情。面对着广大群众的欢笑，右倾机会主义分子却哭哭啼啼说什么公社办错了，办垮了。这除了说明他们从资产阶级立场出发，反对社会主义革命的继续发展外，还能说明什么呢？
    和右倾机会主义分子相反，广大人民从人民公社一年来的伟大胜利中看到，“大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收”的理想，“坡地梯田化，平原河网化，沟壑川台水库化，河道阶梯化，工程系统化，耕地园田化，提水机械化，水力电气化，水产多样化，荒山、荒坡、四旁绿化”的美丽前景，必将通过人民公社，变为现实。
    十年来水利建设的成就是巨大的，但是我们决不为已有的成绩所满足。目前全国还有三分之一以上的耕地，没有灌溉设施；在已有工程中一部分抗灾能力还偏低。大面积的盐碱洼地和水土流失地区尚待治理。黄河的治本工作刚刚开始，长江、珠江、黑龙江的流域治理工作正在规划，即使治理较早的淮河、海河今后也还有很大工作量要做。中小型河流全面治理，农村水电建设和水利资源的综合开发，以及南水北调，根治沙漠，有些才刚刚开瑞，有些还正在研究。就我们伟大祖国的需要来说，我们的水利事业不是办得太多了，而是还要办得更多；不是办得太快了，而是还要办得更快。因之在今后若干年内，还必须坚决反右倾，鼓干劲，继续更多、更快、更好、更省地大办水利。
    国内外反动派和一些右倾机会主义分子对我国水利建设的诽谤攻击是徒劳的。在党的八届八中全会反右倾，鼓干劲的战斗号召下，今冬明春亿万人民还要掀起新的水利高潮，这将又是一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，又是一个大跃进。英雄的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线的红旗，高举大跃进的红旗，高举人民公社的红旗，立下雄心壮志，一定要战胜地球，建立强国，任何力量也不能阻挡我们从胜利走向更大的胜利！
