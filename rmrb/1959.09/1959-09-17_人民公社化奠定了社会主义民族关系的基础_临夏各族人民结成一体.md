Xinhua News Agency report:

The people's commune system has enabled the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province to enter a new stage of socialist ethnic relations. People of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture are working side by side, teaching and helping each other in the happy commune family, and a scene of common prosperity for all ethnic groups has emerged.

The Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, formerly known as Hezhou, is home to seven ethnic groups: Hui, Han, Dongxiang, Baoan, Salar, Tu, and Tibetan. The people of all ethnic groups are hardworking and brave. From the early Qing Dynasty to the eve of the national liberation, countless large-scale peasant uprisings against the reactionary ruling class broke out. However, each movement was later bought and disintegrated by the rulers, and its leadership was usurped by political careerists hidden within religious circles, degenerating into tragic ethnic killings. The notorious Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, and Ma Buqing's Ma family bloodily ruled Linxia for as long as eighty-seven years, making it the place in modern Chinese history with the most and most tragic ethnic killings, and the most acute and complex ethnic contradictions.

After liberation, under the Party's policy of ethnic equality and unity, the past phenomenon of Hui and Han people living in the same village, hearing each other's chickens and dogs, but never interacting with each other, was completely changed. After the land reform, people of all ethnic groups jointly formed mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives. Through common labor and common life, they established new ethnic relations, and many moving examples such as Unity Canal, Unity Bridge, Unity Water, and Unity Road emerged. However, due to the small scale of the advanced cooperatives at that time (897 advanced cooperatives in the whole prefecture, with an average of 135 households per cooperative), the manpower was small, and the funds were meager, they could only engage in one industry and could not engage in multiple industries; they could only build small-scale water conservancy projects and it was difficult to build large-scale water conservancy projects; they could only partially control soil erosion in one mountain and one ditch, and could not comprehensively plan forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Therefore, there were still many problems that were difficult to solve in terms of rationally using water sources, grasslands, and forests and comprehensively changing the arid landscape. Originally, these things were just general problems in other regions, but here they affected the unity and friendship between ethnic groups. At the same time, the farming techniques of the Hui, Dongxiang, Baoan, and Salar ethnic groups were relatively backward, and the agricultural harvest was generally 20% lower than that of the Han people, while the Han people also needed to learn the techniques of raising sheep and engaging in sideline occupations from the minority ethnic groups.

In October 1958, the 897 advanced cooperatives in the whole prefecture were merged into 45 people's communes, with an average of 2,700 households per commune. Among them, 41 communes were joint ethnic communities established by various ethnic groups. After the communization, on the basis of the continuous improvement of the people's socialist consciousness, the roots of manufacturing ethnic contradictions were thoroughly excavated. The people's communes laid the foundation for socialist ethnic relations politically and economically, and rapidly developed the friendship between people of all ethnic groups.

People's communes uniformly and rationally utilize resources, solving the contradictions that were difficult to solve during the advanced cooperative period. The scale of the people's communes in the Linxia area is on average twenty times larger than that of the advanced cooperatives, and it combines the interests of all ethnic groups into a unified whole. Therefore, as soon as the commune was established, the contradictions in the joint use of water sources, grasslands, and forests during the advanced cooperative period were readily solved. For example, in the Majiaji Han area near the Taizi Mountain area of ​​the Luojiaji Commune in Hezheng County, the forest is dense and there is an inexhaustible supply of firewood, but the Majiapu area where the Hui people live has no firewood to burn. In 1933, because the Hui people went up the mountain to cut firewood, the Han and Hui people fought a lawsuit for sixteen years, and their property was exhausted. After liberation, although the lawsuit was not fought after mediation, the contradiction was still not completely resolved. After the communization, Majiaji was designated as the firewood area of ​​the whole commune in accordance with local conditions, and Majiapu was responsible for supplying Majiaji with vegetables. Now, the Hui and Han people in the two places drive their livestock to send firewood and vegetables to each other, as close as family members.

The powerful people's communes not only solved the contradictions between people of all ethnic groups in the utilization of resources, but also further developed the specialties of people of all ethnic groups, comprehensively developed industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and improved people's lives, enabling all ethnic groups to prosper together. The yield of 1.02 million mu of spring wheat in the whole prefecture "crossed the Yellow River" eight years ahead of schedule, the industrial output value increased by 23% compared with the same period last year, the number of sheep increased by 15%, and livestock and poultry have also greatly developed. For example, the Dahejia People's Commune, which is jointly composed of six ethnic groups including Hui, Han, Baoan, Dongxiang, Salar, and Tu, all wanted to set up a farm tool factory during the advanced cooperative period, but at that time there was insufficient funds. The Han people only had carpenters but no blacksmiths, and the Baoan and Hui ethnic groups had very skilled blacksmiths, but no carpenters, so none of them were set up. After the communization, this ideal was realized, and a farm tool manufacturing and repair factory was built. In the past year, it has created nearly a hundred new-style tools and was named the red flag factory in Linxia City.

The socialist cooperation brought about by the communization has completely changed the arid face of Linxia. The autonomous prefecture has a total of 2.6 million mu of cultivated land, of which 1 million mu are distributed in the arid areas where "nine out of ten crops fail", so thoroughly defeating drought has become the key to developing agricultural production and improving the lives of people of all ethnic groups. From 1950 to 1957, the whole prefecture built 700,000 mu of water conservancy, more than four times the amount at the time of liberation. However, at that time, it was still restricted by the narrow scope of the advanced cooperatives, and most of them were medium-sized and small-scale water conservancy projects. In 1956, the Huangniwan Hui Agricultural Cooperative in Hezheng County measured a 40-mile-long "Camel Neck" canal, and dug a 25-mile-long lower section of the canal in its own cooperative, but the upper section would occupy a large area of good land in the Luojiaji Han Cooperative, and the Han Cooperative refused to allow digging, so the water could not flow down. The communization united these cooperatives into a unified whole. In February this year, the Luojiaji Han team took the initiative to send people to dig through the upper 15 miles of the canal, turning more than 7,000 mu of dry land in the Huangniwan Hui team into irrigated land. In the past year, under the call of "One commune in difficulty, all communes support, one ethnic group in difficulty, all ethnic groups support", the communes of the autonomous prefecture have organized a large army of 240,000 people to conquer mountains and fight water, and built 22 large mountain canals, which can irrigate 950,000 mu of land. Now, the whole prefecture has 870,000 people, with an average of more than two mu of irrigated land per person.

People of all ethnic groups in the commune family have consistent interests and can better help the backward and move forward together. Through large-scale cooperation, the Diaotan Commune in Hezheng County helped Hui and Dongxiang commune members change from broadcasting to row planting, and also cultivated 340 skilled seed drill operators in the labor process by the method of master-apprentice teaching. The grain output of the Majiuchuan Han team of the Yinji Commune in Linxia City was 25% higher than that of the adjacent Malian Beach Hui team. The two teams held a meeting together to summarize experience and find the reasons. They found that the Hui team had less fertilizer, weak leadership, and backward technology. The Majiuchuan team sent all the fertilizer saved by the 100 heads of livestock grazing on the Malian Beach to the Hui team, and elected Wu Xueliang, the secretary of the party branch of the team, to represent all the Han people in the team to help the Hui brothers learn technology and do a good job in production and catch up with themselves. Last year, the mountain flood flooded the crops of the Han team. In June this year, the Hui commune members of the Malian team heard the news of a rainstorm on the radio. More than 300 laborers immediately mobilized to help the Han people strengthen the dikes and overcome the flood. Han cadres in the Dongxiang Autonomous County have helped the Suonanba Commune cultivate more than 600 Dongxiang cadres by making friends, teaching culture, taking apprentices, and teaching methods, which has enhanced the leadership of the commune. Under the Party's communist style and the ideological education of "bringing convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself", all ethnic groups in the communes regard helping the backward catch up with the advanced as the greatest glory of their own ethnic group.

The historical estrangement, suspicion, and hatred have been eliminated along with the reactionary ruling class that created them. All ethnic groups have formed a single entity with the same breath and the same destiny in the people's commune. Socialist ethnic friendship is blooming and bearing fruit, and the de facto inequalities left over from history between ethnic groups are being eliminated. People of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture have compiled many ballads to praise the Communist Party and praise the people's commune system. They passionately sing: "Pea flowers are blooming everywhere in red, people of all ethnic groups are linked together, Hui, Han, and Dongxiang are in the same commune, and will always follow Mao Zedong!"

    人民公社化奠定了社会主义民族关系的基础
    临夏各族人民结成一体
    新华社讯　人民公社化使甘肃省临夏回族自治州迈进了社会主义民族关系的新阶段。自治州各族人民正在欢乐的公社大家庭里，并肩劳动，互教互助，出现了各民族共同繁荣的景象。
    临夏回族自治州，即古河州，聚居着回、汉、东乡、保安、撒拉、土、藏等七种民族。各族人民勤劳勇敢，自清朝初年到全国解放前夕，曾经爆发过无数次大规模反对反动统治阶级的农民起义运动，但每次运动后来都被统治者收买分化和被暗藏在宗教界内的政治野心家篡夺领导权，变质为悲惨的民族仇杀。臭名远扬的马鸿逵、马步芳、马步青的马氏家族，在临夏血腥统治达八十七年之久，使这里成为我国近代历史上民族仇杀最多最惨，民族矛盾最尖锐复杂的地方。
    解放后，在党的民族平等、团结的政策下，彻底改变了过去回汉人民同住一村，鸡犬相闻，老死不相往来的现象。土地改革以后，各族人民联合组成了互助组、农业社，通过共同劳动，共同生活，建立起新的民族关系，出现了团结渠、团结桥、团结水、团结路等许多动人事例。但是，由于当时高级社的范围小（全州八百九十七个高级社，每社平均一百三十五户），人力少，资金单薄，只能一业经营，不能百业并举；只能兴修小型水利，很难举办大型水利事业；只能一山一沟的局部治理水土流失，不能全面规划林、牧、副业。因此，在合理利用水源、草滩、山林与全面改变干旱面貌等方面还有许多问题难以解决。本来，这些事情在其他地区只是一般问题，但是在这里却影响着民族之间的团结和友谊。同时，回、东乡、保安、撒拉等民族的耕作技术比较落后，农业收获量一般比汉民低20％，而汉民也需要学习少数民族养羊、搞副业的技术。
    1958年10月，全州八百九十七个高级社合并建成四十五个人民公社，每社平均两千七百户。其中有四十一个公社是各民族合作建立的民族联合社。公社化后，在人民社会主义觉悟不断提高的基础上，彻底地挖除了制造民族矛盾的根源，人民公社从政治、经济上奠定了社会主义民族关系的基础，迅速地发展着各族人民的友谊。
    人民公社统一合理利用资源，解决了高级社时期难以解决的矛盾。临夏地区的人民公社的规模平均比高级社大二十倍，它将各族人民的利益结合成了一个统一的整体。因此，公社一成立，高级社时期在共同使用水源、草滩、山林等方面的矛盾迎刃而解。如和政县罗家集公社靠近太子山一带的马家集汉民地区，森林茂密，柴草取之不尽，回民居住的马家堡一带却没有柴烧。1933年，因为回民上山砍柴，汉、回两族人民曾打了十六年的官司，财产耗费殆尽。解放后，经调解，官司虽然不打了，但矛盾仍未完全解决。公社化后，因地制宜地将马家集划成全社的柴薪区，马家堡负责供应马家集的蔬菜，现在两地的回汉民赶着牲口互相送柴送菜，亲如家人。
    强大的人民公社不仅解决了各族人民在利用资源上的矛盾，并且进一步发挥了各族人民的专长，全面发展工、农、林、牧、副、渔各种生产和改善人民生活，使各民族共同繁荣。全州一百零二万亩春小麦的产量提前八年“跨过了黄河”，工业产值比去年同期增加了23％，羊只增加了15％，家畜家禽也有很大发展。如由回、汉、保安、东乡、撒拉、土等六个民族联合组成的大河家人民公社，在高级社时各社都想办一个农具厂，但当时资金不足，汉民只有木工没有铁匠，保安族和回族有技艺很好的铁匠，可是没有木工，结果都没办起来。公社化后这个理想得以实现，建起了一座农具制造修配工厂，一年来创造了近百件新式工具，被评为临夏市的红旗工厂。
    公社化带来的社会主义大协作，彻底改变了临夏的干旱面貌。自治州共有耕地二百六十万亩，其中一百万亩分布在“十种九不收”的干旱地区，因而彻底战胜干旱，就成为发展农业生产和改善各族人民生活的关键。1950至1957年，全州共兴修水利七十万亩，比解放时增加四倍多。但当时还受着高级社狭小范围的束缚，多是中、小型水利工程。1956年，和政县黄泥湾回民农业社，测量了一条四十里长的骆驼脖项水渠，并在自己社里挖好了二十五里长的下段渠道，但上段要占用罗家集汉民合作社的大片好地，汉民合作社不让挖，水没法淌下来。公社化将这些社结成了一个统一的整体，今年2月，罗家集汉民队主动派人挖通了渠道的上段十五里，使黄泥湾回民队的七千多亩旱地变成了水地。一年来，自治州各公社在“一社有困难、各社齐支援，一族有困难、各族齐支援”的号召下，组织了二十四万人的大军，征山战水，修成二十二条上山大渠，可浇地九十五万亩。现在，全州八十七万人，每人平均有二亩多水地。
    各族人民在公社大家庭里利益一致，更能帮助落后，共同前进。和政县吊滩公社通过大协作，汉族老农帮助回族和东乡族社员改撒播为条播，还在劳动中以师傅带徒弟的方法，培养了三百四十名摇耧能手。临夏市尹集公社麻九川汉民队的粮食产量比相邻的马莲滩回民队的产量高25％，两个队就在一起开会总结经验找原因，发现回民队肥料少、领导力量薄弱、技术落后，麻九川队就把在马莲滩上放牧的一百头牲畜攒下的肥料全部送给了回民队，并推选本队党支部书记吴学良，代表全队汉民去马莲队帮助回民兄弟学会技术搞好生产，赶上自己。去年山洪下来曾经淹了汉民队的庄稼，今年6月马莲队的回民社员从广播里听到要下暴雨的消息，三百多个劳力立即全体出动，帮助汉民加固堤防，战胜了洪水。东乡族自治县的汉族干部，通过交朋友、教文化，带徒弟、教办法，帮助锁南坝公社培养起东乡族干部六百多人，增强了公社的领导力量。在党的共产主义风格、“把方便带给别人，将困难留给自己”的思想教育下，各公社的各个民族都把帮助落后赶上先进，当作本民族的最大的光荣。
    历史上遗留下来的隔阂、猜疑、仇恨，已经和制造它们的反动统治阶级一起消灭，各民族在人民公社里结成了同呼吸共命运的同一体，社会主义的民族友谊正在开花结果，各民族之间历史上遗留下的事实上不平等现象正在消除。自治州各族人民编出了很多歌谣歌颂共产党、赞扬人民公社化。他们激情地唱着：“豌豆开花遍地红，各族人民心连心，回汉东乡同公社，永远跟着毛泽东！”
