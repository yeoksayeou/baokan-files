Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 20th – Before the first furnace of Baotou Iron and Steel Company was about to produce iron, Comrade Ulanhu and some leaders of the Inner Mongolia Party, government, and military visited Baotou Steel today to inspect work and offer condolences to Baotou Steel workers.

　　Comrade Ulanhu spoke to the builders of the No. 1 blast furnace. First, on behalf of the Inner Mongolia Party, government, and military leadership organs and the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region, he extended cordial greetings and warm congratulations to the workers of all ethnic groups at Baotou Steel. He said: Baotou Steel is one of the three iron and steel joint enterprises currently under construction in our country. Its design, equipment, and production processes all adopt the world's advanced technological achievements. Carrying out the construction of such a large-scale iron and steel backbone enterprise in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has a relatively weak industrial foundation, is of extremely great significance for accelerating the process of socialist industrialization in our country, changing the economic outlook of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and promoting the industrial construction and agricultural and pastoral technical transformation of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It demonstrates the great victory achieved by the Party's General Line and the Party's ethnic policies in socialist construction.

　　Ulanhu said: The workers of all ethnic groups in Baotou Steel, together with the people of the whole country, actively responded to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and displayed soaring enthusiasm, carrying out selfless labor to bring forward the iron production of the Baotou Steel No. 1 blast furnace. The fact that the No. 1 blast furnace was completed a year ahead of schedule powerfully refuted the slander and vilification of the General Line for building socialism in our country by those hostile elements at home and abroad.

　　He also said: The completion of Baotou Steel’s No. 1 blast furnace one year ahead of schedule marks that the construction of the Baotou industrial base has entered a new stage. It will enter a new period in which basic construction and industrial production are carried out simultaneously from the period mainly based on basic construction. The No. 1 blast furnace is about to produce iron, which is a great and inspiring event for the whole country and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. However, as far as the entire construction of Baotou Steel is concerned, this is just the beginning of flowering and bearing fruit. The future construction tasks are still very arduous and heavy. It is hoped that all employees will redouble their efforts, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, earnestly learn from the rich technical experience of Soviet experts, and strive to improve their construction skills.

　　After the meeting, Ulanhu and other leaders visited the No. 1 blast furnace and the No. 4 and No. 3 coke ovens of the coking plant.

    内蒙古领导人慰问包钢职工
    新华社包头20日电　在包头钢铁公司一号高炉即将出铁之前，乌兰夫同志和一些内蒙古党政军领导人今天到包钢视察工作，慰问包钢职工。
    乌兰夫同志向一号高炉的建设者们讲了话。他首先代表内蒙古党政军领导机关和全自治区各族人民，向包钢各族职工致以亲切的慰问和热烈的祝贺。他说：包钢是我国当前建设的三个钢铁联合企业之一，它的设计、设备和生产过程，都采用了世界上先进的技术成就。在工业基础比较薄弱的内蒙古自治区进行这样大型钢铁骨干企业的建设，对于加速我们国家社会主义工业化的进程，和改变内蒙古自治区的经济面貌，促进内蒙古自治区的工业建设和农牧业的技术改造，都有极其重大的意义，它显示了党的总路线和党的民族政策在社会主义建设中取得的伟大胜利。
    乌兰夫说：包钢的各族职工和全国人民一道，积极响应党的八届八中全会号召，发挥了冲天的干劲，为包钢一号高炉提前出铁进行了忘我的劳动。一号高炉能够提前一年建成，这一事实有力地驳斥了那些国内外敌对分子对我国建设社会主义的总路线的诽谤和污蔑。
    他还说：包钢一号高炉提前一年建成，标志着包头工业基地的建设已进入了一个新的阶段，它将由以基本建设为主的时期，进入基本建设和工业生产同时并进的新时期。一号高炉即将出铁了，这对全国和内蒙古自治区是一件振奋人心的大喜事。但是，就包钢的全部建设来说，这还是开始开花结果，今后的建设任务还是十分艰巨和繁重的，希望全体职工更加鼓足干劲，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，认真学习苏联专家丰富的技术经验，努力提高自己的建设本领。
    会后，乌兰夫等领导人参观了一号高炉和焦化厂四号、三号焦炉。
