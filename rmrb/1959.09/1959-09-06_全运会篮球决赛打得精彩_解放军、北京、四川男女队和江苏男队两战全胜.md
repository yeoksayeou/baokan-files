Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: The second round of the National Games basketball finals was held today. The results of the first two rounds: The men's and women's teams from the PLA, Beijing, and Sichuan have all won two games in a row, and the Jiangsu men's team has also achieved two consecutive victories.

Some complex situations emerged in today's competition. The Yunnan women's team, which defeated Hebei by one point yesterday, lost to the Guangdong women's team today (47-71). The Shanghai women's team, which defeated the PLA women's team in the preliminary round and won the division championship, was defeated by the Hebei women's team (48-55). The Jiangsu women's team and the Liaoning men's team, who suffered their first defeats in the first round, defeated the Shanxi women's team 59-49 and the Guangdong men's team 89-75, respectively. The Hebei men's team, which defeated Liaoning in the first round, lost to the Shanghai men's team today (68-79).

The Jiangsu men's team, after defeating the strong Shanghai men's team in their first match yesterday, had a very close game with the Heilongjiang men's team today. In the final five-minute "decisive period," they won by only one point (93-92).

In addition, the PLA men's and women's teams defeated the Hubei men's and women's teams 96-66 and 70-49 respectively; the Beijing men's and women's teams defeated the Jilin men's and women's teams 96-69 and 73-49 respectively; the Sichuan men's and women's teams also defeated the Shaanxi men's team and the Guizhou women's team 90-60 and 71-52 respectively.

The match between the Jiangsu men's team and the Heilongjiang men's team was particularly intense. In the first half, the Heilongjiang team led 44-39. The Heilongjiang team had a fierce attack and got more rebounds. In the last five minutes of the second half, the Jiangsu team launched a fierce counterattack to maintain a seesaw situation. With 45 seconds left, Heilongjiang was still ahead by one point, 83-81, but with 18 seconds left, Wang Siren of Heilongjiang fouled, and He Meichu of Jiangsu deliberately missed the free throw, trying to regain two points with a rebound, but the plan failed, and the ball was snatched by the Heilongjiang team. Just as they were attacking, the Heilongjiang team called a timeout, and then the ball was taken by the Jiangsu team and scored, tying the score at 83. So they extended the game for another five minutes. Wang Jinhe, Cai Yuhai, and Hu Lide of the Jiangsu team scored ten points with five consecutive goals. However, the Heilongjiang team only scored nine points, resulting in a one-point defeat.

The game between the Hebei women's team and the Shanghai women's team was also tense and exciting, and both teams had a very fast pace of attack. The Shanghai women's team lost because of poor shooting accuracy. They shot as many as 75 times throughout the game, but only scored 18 times, with a shooting rate of only 24%. The Hebei women's team only shot 40 times in the whole game, but scored 21 times, with a shooting rate of 52%.

    全运会篮球决赛打得精彩
    解放军、北京、四川男女队和江苏男队两战全胜
    新华社5日讯　全运会篮球第二轮决赛今天举行。前两轮结果：解放军、北京和四川的男、女队都已两战两胜，江苏男队也获得两战两胜的战绩。
    今天比赛中出现了一些错综复杂的情况。昨天以一分之差胜了河北的云南女队，今天败给广东女队（四十七比七十一）；在预赛中力胜解放军女队、获得分区冠军的上海女队，又被河北女队打败（四十八比五十五）。在第一轮首遭败绩的江苏女队和辽宁男队，今天前者以五十九比四十九胜山西女队，后者以八十九比七十五胜广东男队。第一轮胜辽宁的河北男队，今天败于上海男队（六十八比七十九）。
    江苏男队昨天首战胜了实力坚强的上海男队后，今天和黑龙江男队打得难解难分，在最后延长五分钟的“决胜期”中，仅以一分的优势（九十三比九十二）获胜。
    此外，解放军男、女队今天以九十六比六十六和七十比四十九双双战胜湖北男、女队；北京男、女队以九十六比六十九和七十三比四十九分别赢吉林男、女队；四川男、女队也以九十比六十和七十一比五十二分别胜陕西男队和贵州女队。
    江苏男队和黑龙江男队之战分外紧张。上半场黑龙江队以四十四比三十九领先。黑龙江队进攻猛烈，得到篮板球较多，到下半场最后五分钟，江苏队展开猛烈反攻，才能维持拉锯局面，到最后四十五秒，黑龙江队仍以八十三比八十一胜一球，但到最后十八秒钟，黑龙江王思仁犯规，江苏队贺梅初故意不投中，想用篮板球夺回两分，但是计谋不成，球反被黑龙江队夺去。正当进攻的时候，黑龙江队叫暂停，接着球又被江苏队拿去投进，拉成八十三平。于是延长五分钟再战。江苏队王锦和、蔡玉海和胡利德连进五球得了十分。可是黑龙江队只得了九分，结果相差一分而告失败。
    河北女队胜上海女队的比赛也打得紧张精采，两个队进攻速度都很快。上海女队输在投篮欠准。她们全场投篮达七十五次之多，但只投中十八次，命中率只达24％。而河北女队全场投篮只四十次，投中的却达二十一次，命中率为52％。
