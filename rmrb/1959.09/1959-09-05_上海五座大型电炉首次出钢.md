Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 4th: A very large electric furnace workshop was completed and put into production at the Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant on September 1st. The five newly installed large electric furnaces constantly poured out dazzling molten steel. This electric furnace workshop was built in a rush to cooperate with the development of Shanghai's electromechanical industry towards high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products. It can smelt various high-quality steels and advanced alloy steels.

This workshop was designed and built according to advanced standards. The five electric furnaces, from feeding, opening and closing the furnace door, raising and lowering the carbon rods, to rotating the furnace body, are all operated by electricity. The workshop is also equipped with overhead cranes with electromagnetic iron suction. From the time construction workers drove the first pile on May 8th, to the time the installation workers tightened the last bolt on the furnace body and released the first furnace of molten steel, it took just over three months to build such a modern steelmaking workshop. After more than 20 days of inspection by the Black Metallurgical Design Institute and relevant departments, the project quality was unanimously considered to be good.

    上海五座大型电炉首次出钢
    新华社上海4日电　一座规模很大的电炉车间，9月1日在上海第五钢铁厂建成投入生产。五座新安装起来的大型电炉，不时地倾泻出耀眼的钢水。这个电炉车间是配合上海机电工业向高、大、精、尖方向发展而赶建的。它可以冶炼各种优质钢和高级合金钢。
    这个车间是按照先进的水平设计建设的。五座电炉，从加料、炉门开闭、炭棒升降，直到炉身旋转，都用电力操纵。车间里还装有电磁吸铁的行车。像这样现代化的炼钢车间，从5月8日建筑工人打下第一根桩起，直到安装工人拧紧炉身最后一颗螺丝钉、放出第一炉钢水止，前后不过用了三个多月的时间。工程质量经过黑色冶金设计院和有关部门二十多天的检查，一致认为良好。
