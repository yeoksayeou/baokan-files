Light as a Swallow, Strong as an Eagle
    ——Watching the Gymnastics Competition
  　By Our Reporter　Yang Kexian
    Beijing's Shichahai gymnastics competition venue was packed with spectators on the afternoon and evening of the 16th. One hundred and twenty-nine male and female gymnastics athletes, as light as swallows and as strong as eagles, unfolded their final two events in the competition for the championship.
    As the piano played softly, the gymnastics athletes entered the arena. They wore colorful sportswear and moved to the designated carpet to warm up.
    A twelve-square-meter green carpet in the center of the venue attracted people's attention. This was the venue for the free exercise competition, the foundation of gymnastics. The free exercise competition began. Athletes performed a series of healthy and graceful movements such as flips, balances, and splits one after another. They looked like hawks turning over in the sky and dragonflies skimming the water. Some performed back handsprings with agility and speed, while others performed spectacular front aerials, back aerials, and side aerials. Everyone jumped high and landed lightly, truly rising with the wind and landing without a sound.
    The women's individual gymnastics optional routine, featuring swallow-like flight and fish-like leaps, also received special attention from the audience that day. Ding Zhaofang, a twelve-year-old athlete from Anhui, defeated her twenty-five competitors with an overwhelming advantage. This girl, just over one meter tall and wearing a red outfit, performed a series of front handsprings, back handsprings, and various aerial flips in one breath, moving so quickly that she looked like a ball of fire rolling on the carpet. It was almost impossible to distinguish when one front handspring transitioned into a back handspring. At this point, the audience was extremely excited and stood up to applaud her, and their excitement lingered long after the judges announced her excellent score.
    Another lively place was the venue for the men's pair gymnastics and group routine competition. The audience saw some very difficult stunts here: single-arm headstand and head-to-head headstand. The Shanghai team's head-to-head headstand didn't even use any headgear. Several teams were able to perform the "180-degree rotation support" action, where an athlete lying on the carpet supported another athlete of similar age turning around with both hands. The group routine was performed by four people. They formed a human pyramid and threw a person into the air, letting him perform two somersaults in the air before landing on the ground like a swallow.
    Mixed pair gymnastics is a new event added to the First National Games. It combines gymnastics with ballet, making the movements very beautiful. The throw and catch actions of the Fujian team were very accurate and soft. The performers were thirteen-year-old Liu Chunping (female) and sixteen-year-old Du Huixiong. Liu Chunping was gently thrown up by Du Huixiong and gently caught, as freely as a fish swimming into water. At other times, she performed back leg extensions, handstand splits, and swallow balances on Du Huixiong's shoulders and hands, as soft as if she had no bones. The two won the championship in this competition. (Attached picture)

    轻如飞燕　健如雄鹰
    ——看技巧竞赛
  　本报记者　杨克现
    北京什刹海技巧竞赛场，16日下午和晚上挤满了观众。轻如飞燕、健如雄鹰的一百二十九名男女技巧运动员，在这里展开了最后两场争夺锦标赛的活动。
    钢琴轻声奏起，技巧运动员出场。他们穿着五颜六色的运动服装，来到规定的地毯上活动。
    场地中央一张十二平方米大的绿色地毯引起了人们的注意，这是自由操竞赛的场地。技巧运动的基础的自由操竞赛开始了。运动员们接二连三地在作翻转、平衡、劈腿等健康优美的动作。只见他们一会儿像鹞子翻身，一会儿像蜻蜓点水。有的人后手翻灵巧而迅速，有的人前空翻、后空翻和侧空翻精彩。个个跃得高、落脚轻，真是跃起风卷，落地无声。
    燕飞鱼跃的女子单人技巧自选动作这一天也受到观众特别的注意。安徽十二岁的选手丁照芳以压倒的优势战胜了和她竞争的二十五名选手。这个刚过一米的女孩穿着一套红色的服装，她前手翻、后手翻和各种空翻动作一口气连续进行，迅速得像一团火球在地毯上滚动。几乎分辨不出在那一次前手翻变换为后手翻。这时，观众兴奋已极，纷纷站起来为她鼓掌，直等到裁判员公布出她优异的成绩，人们的心情还久久不能平静。
    还有一个热闹的地方是男子双人技巧和团体动作竞赛的场地。观众在这里看到了一些难度很大的绝技：头上单臂倒立、头对头倒立。上海代表队的头对头倒立，竟不借助任何头圈。好几个代表队都能够进行“转体一百八十度仰撑”的动作，躺在地毯上的运动员双手倒撑起和他年龄相当的另一个运动员转身。团体动作由四人进行，他们一会儿叠成罗汉，一会儿把一个人抛向空中，让他在空中连续翻两个跟斗，然后燕子般地落下地面。
    男女混合技巧运动是第一届全国运动会新增加的项目。它使技巧运动结合了芭蕾舞，动作非常优美。福建代表队选手的抛接动作十分准确和柔软，表演者是十三岁的刘春平（女）和十六岁的杜辉雄。只见刘春平一会儿被杜辉雄轻轻抛起，轻轻地接着，自如得像鱼游进了水。一会儿她又在杜辉雄的肩上、手上作着背腿、倒立劈腿、燕式平衡等动作，柔软得像没有了骨胳。他俩获得了这项比赛的冠军。（附图片）
