Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 13th: The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country and the realization of communes in rural areas have powerfully promoted the increased production of daily necessities in Shanghai.

The city's more than two thousand factories manufacturing daily necessities have seen simultaneous increases in output, quality, and variety this year. From January to August, the total output value of the city's daily-use industrial products increased by more than 20% compared with the same period last year. In terms of products, the output of major varieties such as cotton cloth, paper, fountain pens, thermos bottles, and clocks and watches increased by 10% to more than 100% compared with the same period last year. Product quality has also improved. Among the twenty-one major products of the cotton textile industry in the first half of the year, the quality of fourteen was better than in the fourth quarter of last year. The quality of light industrial products such as enamelware, chemical products, bicycles, and monosodium glutamate has also greatly exceeded the level of the first half of last year. The city has also successfully trial-produced more than five thousand new varieties and designs of daily necessities. Among them, the light industry system has put into production nearly one thousand new varieties and designs, such as seventeen-jewel women's watches, pocket fountain pens, simple sewing machines, and double-lid thermos bottles.

The results of the Great Leap Forward and communization have created three extremely favorable conditions for the great development of Shanghai's daily-use industrial products this year: First, various regions have provided more raw materials than in previous years; second, they have opened up an unprecedentedly vast sales market; and third, the production capacity and technical level of Shanghai's daily-use industrial products have also greatly improved.

Since the beginning of this year, the raw materials supplied to Shanghai from various regions have been continuously flowing in. In the first eight months, the light industry system in Shanghai was allocated more than 73,000 tons of steel. From September of last year to August of this year, during the cotton production year, various regions transported 8 million dan of cotton, more than 1.9 million dan more than the previous production year, creating the highest record in history. The number of work shifts in the city's more than 40 cotton textile mills this year is more than in any previous year during the same period. From January to July, the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth exceeded the planned targets every month. What is particularly important is that, due to the mass steelmaking campaign and the active development of diversified operations by the people's communes, many new sources of raw materials have been opened up for Shanghai's daily-use industrial products. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai has used indigenous steel, indigenous iron, wild fibers, and wild starch to produce large quantities of sewing machine frames, door locks, hinges, paper, alcohol, etc. Some products that were previously manufactured with imported raw materials for a long time have now begun to be manufactured with domestic raw materials. For example, glass instrument, fountain pen, and bicycle factories have completely or partially used domestic optical glass, iridium tips, celluloid, steel balls, and other raw materials for production.

This year, the daily-use industrial products that various regions require Shanghai to supply are not only large in quantity but also require high quality and new designs. Rural women, freed from the constraints of housework, are participating in production and have labor income, greatly increasing the demand for clothing items such as printed cloth, underwear, woolen yarn, and headscarves; they also need to purchase various rubber shoes. The establishment and development of collective welfare undertakings such as communal canteens, nurseries, hospitals, and sewing departments in the communes require more and more relevant industrial products such as large pots, enamel tableware, children's toys, medical equipment, and sewing machines. Therefore, the sales situation of Shanghai's daily-use industrial products has been unprecedentedly prosperous this year. In the past eight months, Shanghai has already shipped out more than 600,000 tons of goods, and the daily-use industrial products shipped out on average every day require 66 train cars to load.

Under the favorable situation of the Great Leap Forward, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed at the beginning of this year that Shanghai's industry should not only develop in the direction of advanced, large-scale, precise, and cutting-edge, but also meet the needs of people's lives, and has been closely grasping the leadership and arrangement of the production of daily-use industrial products. The workers and staff of the city's light industry, textile industry, and handicraft industry departments have carried forward the effective production increase experiences from last year's Great Leap Forward, launched a mass movement to make the best use of everything, and actively explored the potential of raw materials from five aspects: comprehensive utilization, rational use, economical substitution, recycling and reuse, and waste utilization, trying every possible means to expand the production of daily necessities. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau, almost half of the output value in the first half of the year was increased through the "five uses" movement. While striving for high output, workers and staff launched competitions for high quality and variety, and did their best to produce better quality and more novel daily necessities. Since the second quarter of this year, factories have conducted major quality inspections and evaluations, strengthened product inspections, improved production technology, and exchanged operational experiences, improving product quality.

### 大跃进和公社化提供了充足原料开拓了广阔市场  上海轻纺工业一片繁荣

    大跃进和公社化提供了充足原料开拓了广阔市场
    上海轻纺工业一片繁荣
    新华社上海13日电　各地工农业生产的大跃进和农村实现公社化，有力地促进了上海的日用品工业增加生产。
    全市二千多家制造日用品的工厂，今年产量、质量、花色品种齐头并进。1月到8月，全市日用工业品的生产总值比去年同期增长20％以上。从产品看，这八个月生产的棉布、纸张、金笔、热水瓶、钟表等主要品种，分别比去年同期增加一成到一倍以上。产品质量也有所提高。上半年棉纺工业的二十一种主要产品中，有十四种的质量比去年第四季度为好。轻工业方面的搪瓷制品、化学制品、自行车、味精等产品的质量，也大大超过去年上半年的水平。全市还试制成功五千三百多个新品种和新花色的日用品。其中，轻工业系统投入生产的新花色新品种，就有十七钻女用手表、袖珍钢笔、简易缝纫机、双盖热水瓶等近一千种。
    大跃进和公社化的结果，为今年上海日用工业品生产的大发展，创造了三个极为有利的条件：首先，各地提供了比往年更多的原料、材料；其次，开拓了空前广阔的销售市场；第三，上海日用品工业的生产能力和技术水平也有很大的提高。
    今年以来，各地供应上海的原料材料源源不断。头八个月中，上海轻工业系统分配到的钢铁有七万三千多吨。去年9月到今年8月这一棉花生产年度，各地运来棉花八百万担，比上一生产年度多一百九十多万担，创造了历年来的最高纪录。全市四十多家棉纺织厂今年来的开工班次，比以往任何一年的同期都多。1至7月份，棉纱、棉布的产量，月月超额完成计划。特别重要的是，由于全民大炼钢铁和人民公社积极发展多种经营，给上海日用品工业开辟了许多新的原料来源。今年以来，上海已经用土钢、土铁、野生纤维和野生淀粉，制出了大批缝纫机架、门锁、铰链、纸张、酒精等。某些过去长期用进口原料制造的产品，现在开始采用国产原料制造，如玻璃仪器、金笔、自行车工厂，已经全部或部分用国产的光学玻璃、铱粒、赛璐珞、钢珠等原料来生产。
    今年，各地要求上海供应的日用工业品，不仅数量大，而且要求质量高、花色新。摆脱家务牵累的农村妇女参加生产，有了劳动收入，对花布、内衣、毛线、头巾等穿着用品的需要量大为增加；她们又要购买各种胶鞋。公社公共食堂、托儿所、医院、缝纫部等集体福利事业的举办和发展，需要的大锅子、搪瓷餐具、儿童玩具、医疗器械、缝纫机等有关工业品越来越多。因此，今年上海日用工业品的销售情况空前地畅旺。在过去的八个月里，上海已经调出商品六十多万吨，目前平均每天运出的日用工业品，需要六十六个火车皮才能装载得了。
    在大跃进的有利形势下，中共上海市委在今年年初就提出：上海工业既要向高级、大型、精密、尖端的方向发展，又要满足人民生活的需要，并且一直抓紧对日用工业品生产的领导和安排。全市轻工业、纺织工业和手工业部门的职工，发扬去年大跃进中各项行之有效的增产经验，开展了一个群众性的物尽其用运动，从综合利用、合理使用、节约代用、回收重用、废物利用五个方面，积极挖掘原料潜力，千方百计扩大日用品生产。据上海轻工业局统计，上半年几乎一半的产值是通过开展“五用”运动而增产的。在力争高产的同时，职工们开展了优质和多品种的竞赛，尽力生产出质量更好、式样更新的日用品。今年第二季度来，各厂进行质量大检查、大评比，加强产品检验，改进生产技术，交流操作经验，提高了产品的质量。（附图片）
