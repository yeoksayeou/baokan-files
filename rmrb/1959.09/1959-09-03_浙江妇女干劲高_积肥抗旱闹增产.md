Accumulating Fertilizer, Fighting Drought, and Striving for Increased Production

    Rural women in Zhejiang Province are responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions to strive for increased autumn agricultural production.

    In Wuxing County, 25,000 rural women, after listening to the broadcast of the communique and resolutions, immediately plunged into fertilizer accumulation and drought resistance activities that very night. In the Xilin Production Team of the Nanxun Commune in this county, 59 women organized five fertilizer accumulation shock teams, collecting 29,700 dan of aquatic plants in just a few days. In Anji County, more than 19,500 women also joined the fertilizer accumulation campaign. Hu Fuying's women's experimental group from the Xinji Production Team of the Zha Pu Commune in Pinghu County selected manure from their own homes to apply the fourth fertilizer application to the late rice; and proposed an initiative to all women in the brigade: take responsibility for the 20% of third-class seedlings and quickly turn them into first-class seedlings. In Tonglu County, women organized a total of 4,434 specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, with an average of 29,000 women participating in fertilizer accumulation these days.

    In Zhuji, Yuyao, Shangyu, Xiangshan and other counties, 350,000 women also joined the fertilizer accumulation campaign, strengthened field management, and ensured the success of women's experimental high-yield fields. More than 10,000 mu of women's experimental fields in the Jinhua area have now generally been hoed for the third time. The famous "Seven Fairies" of the Haimen Commune in Huangyan County put forward the battle cry of "Fight drought at night, control pests, accumulate fertilizer during the day, and strive for high yields and bumper harvests." These days, they are applying the fifth fertilizer application and removing pests for the third time in the cotton experimental fields.

    The broad masses of women in the fishing areas of Zhoushan County have established 1,520 groups to study the communique and resolutions. They proposed to complete the production task of 120,000 various fishing nets for the entire county two months ahead of schedule. They also actively participated in agricultural production.

    诸暨、余姚、上虞、象山等县也有三十五万妇女投入积肥运动，加强田间管理，保证搞好妇女试验高产畈。金华专区一万多亩妇女试验田，目前已经普遍耘过了第三遍。黄岩县海门公社著名的“七仙女”，提出了“夜里抗旱，白天治虫、积肥、力争超产丰收”的战斗口号，这几天她们正在棉花试验田里施第五遍肥，除第三次虫。
    舟山县渔区广大妇女，成立了一千五百二十个小组学习公报和决议。她们提出，争取提前两个月完成自己所担负的全县十二万张各种鱼网的生产任务。她们还积极参加农业生产，仅8月28日这一天，就有一万五千名妇女投入积肥，共积肥四十万担。
