    A Treasure Trove of Five Thousand Years of Art
    ——On the Ancient Art Gallery of the Palace Museum
    By Our Correspondent Yu Huiyin
    People who appreciate the artistic essence of our motherland over the past thousands of years in the newly prepared Ancient Art Gallery of the Palace Museum, China's largest art museum, will feel a sense of pride.
    The Ancient Art Gallery is located in the east and west wings of the Hall of Preserving Harmony in the middle of the Forbidden City, and in the two Chonglou buildings. It brings together more than 4,000 representative works of art from the Palace Museum's collection and acquisitions, including paintings, sculptures, calligraphy, inscriptions, bronzes, ceramics, and embroidery. It comprehensively introduces the development of Chinese plastic arts and other arts from the late primitive society to the old democratic revolution period, following the course of history.
    Labor Tools and Plastic Arts
    As early as four or five thousand years ago, in the late period of our primitive society, there was a preliminary division of labor between handicraft industry and agriculture, and practical arts and crafts had already sprouted. In the exhibition hall of the late primitive society and slave society in the Hall of Preserving Harmony, you can see that the working people of 3000-2000 BC had polished their beloved stone axes, stone chisels, stone sickles, stone arrowheads and other labor tools very smoothly, practically and beautifully. They also made hard jade axes. Residents of the Yellow River basin and coastal areas have created painted pottery and black pottery.
    A huge bronze wine vessel, the Three Rams Zun, attracts people's attention. It is majestic in shape, exquisitely cast, and covered in patterns. The three sheep heads on the Zun are vividly carved, and it is a representative of the plastic arts of the late Shang Dynasty in the 12th to 11th centuries BC. The bronze culture, which occupies a very prominent position in ancient Chinese culture, has had a profound impact on the development of later culture and art. From the various bronze exhibits on display, it can be seen that the bronze wares of the Shang Dynasty often used the images of various animals in nature as patterns, which were ever-changing. Each has its own ingenuity, making people feel solemn and mysterious. By the Warring States period, the patterns on bronze wares began to have more complex scenes of life, such as hunting, attacking, mulberry picking, archery, eating and drinking, and music and dance. This was the first time that ancient Chinese art works directly reflected social reality.
    The exhibits from the Warring States, Qin and Han Dynasties, located in the northeast Chonglou and the front part of the East Wing, show that by the early feudal society, various practical arts became more prosperous, the development of culture and art gradually became popular throughout the country, and cultural exchanges with neighboring ethnic groups became more frequent. In the Han Dynasty, stone carvings prevailed. The Xiang Tajun stone pillar unearthed in Shandong in 154 AD has lines carved on it depicting strongmen and some strange beasts, and it can accurately express images.
    The Art of Painting and Calligraphy
    The rear part of the East Wing introduces the great development of art from the Wei, Jin to Song Dynasties. During the "Wei Jin demeanor" era in the third and fourth centuries AD, the first peak of cultural and artistic development in China's feudal society was formed. Calligraphy and painting were formed and became independent arts. There were many famous artists, and appreciating calligraphy and painting became a social fashion at that time. The great painter Gu Kaizhi used the Luo Shen Fu – a beautiful poem in which the famous poet Cao Zhi used mythology to metaphorically express the love he lost – as the theme to paint the Luo Shen Fu Scroll. Because it meticulously depicts people's inner emotional activities, it occupies an important position in the development of ancient painting. The oldest Song Dynasty copy of this painting is displayed here: on the banks of the Luo River, Cao Zhi and his attendants saw from afar that the beautiful goddess of the Luo River, who was the embodiment of his love, appeared on the calm water. In the picture, the distant water is vast, and the goddess of the Luo River seems to come and go, conveying an infinite sense of melancholy. The famous Lu Ji Ping Fu Tie is also on display here, a letter written by the writer Lu Ji to a friend 1,700 years ago. It is the earliest surviving celebrity calligraphy written on paper in China, allowing us to see the cursive script form at that time. The copy of the Lanting Preface on display, the original is a masterpiece by the great calligrapher Wang Xizhi of the Jin Dynasty. The appearance of celadon during this period was a major event in the history of arts and crafts. The celadon glazed jar of Yong'an 3 (260 AD) unearthed in Zhejiang has a slightly yellow glaze color and is decorated with piled up houses, figures, and flying birds, which is a representative work of celadon in the Wei and Jin Dynasties.
    Grotto art and gold and stone statues and other sculptural arts developed greatly in the Eastern Jin and Southern and Northern Dynasties after the fourth century. The solemn and benevolent faces and the smooth and flowing skirts of the Buddha statues show the creative talents of the carving craftsmen.
    In the prosperous Sui and Tang Dynasties, with the expansion of territory, the development of transportation, economic prosperity, culture and art ushered in a new peak, becoming a colorful period in the history of ancient Chinese art. From the various art pieces of the Sui and Tang Dynasties on display, figure paintings and religious paintings were more realistic and vivid than in the past, and there were many famous artists with constantly changing styles. Landscape and animal paintings gradually developed into independent painting subjects, and calligraphy art integrated the north and the south, and the regular script was strict in its rules. The artists were mostly energetic and courageous in creation. A painting of You Chun Tu by the painter Zhan Ziqian, which is displayed here, is probably a work from the end of the sixth century, and is the oldest landscape figure painting preserved from past dynasties. It depicts the bright spring scenery of lakes and mountains and people indulging in sightseeing among the mountains and rivers, with bright colors, giving people a pleasant feeling. People in the past commented that his paintings "look like the shape with the brush, and have emotions beyond the painting," which is indeed very appropriate. The Zhang Hao Hao Poem, a proud work written by the famous poet Du Mu, has a bold and vigorous running script, which is a very precious ink treasure. During this period, the art of sculpture also developed greatly.
    In arts and crafts, the firing of celadon reached a high level, and white porcelain and tricolor pottery were also created.
    Among the exhibits from the Five Dynasties to the Song Dynasty, the most impressive is painting. Song Dynasty painting reached the peak of the development of ancient Chinese painting art, creating countless ingenious artistic expressions, reflecting real life, and being closer to the hobbies of the people. The Xiao Xiang Tu by Dong Yuan, the Han Que Tu by Cui Bai, the Han Xizai Night Banquet Tu by Gu Hongzhong, the Listening to Qin Tu by Zhao Ji (Emperor Huizong of Song), the Four Plum Blossoms Tu by Yang Buzhi, etc., which are displayed here, were all precious famous paintings of the year. In the early Southern Song Dynasty, painters often used ancient stories to allude to the political issues of the time. The famous painter Li Tang's Cai Wei Tu takes the story of Boyi and Shuqi picking weeds in Shouyang Mountain after the fall of the Yin Dynasty, preferring to starve to death rather than eating the grain of the Zhou Dynasty, in order to advocate political integrity. The painter Li Song, who was born as a carpenter, painted the Huo Lang Tu, which depicts the peddler selling goods in the countryside, surrounded by mothers and innocent and lively children, each with their own expressions and dynamics. This painting has a strong folk atmosphere. The painter Ma Yuan's Ta Ge Tu depicts the scene of old and young farmers singing and dancing happily after the harvest. The composition is concise, the brushwork is vigorous, and the characters are very vivid. The development and changes of calligraphy in this period were very great. Yang Ning's cursive script in the Five Dynasties was bold and unrestrained. The brushwork was strong, and the calligraphy of Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, etc. in the Song Dynasty broke through the standards of the Tang Dynasty and formed their own systems.
    The numerous exhibits from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties in the later feudal society occupy the entire West Wing. From the 14th century onwards, during the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, painters advocated learning from the past and paying attention to brush and ink techniques. Landscape painting, orchid, and bamboo painting prevailed. This trend continued until the Qing Dynasty and became the mainstream in painting. Artists admired versatility and often possessed talents such as painting, writing, composing poems, and engraving seals, combining various arts in one work. After the 15th century, painters gradually separated into local schools such as the Zhe School, Jiangxia School, and Wu School. After the 17th century, painters in commercial cities such as Yangzhou and Shanghai developed the freehand style of flower and bird painting. On the other hand, starting from portrait painting, some painters gradually absorbed some Western painting techniques and created new styles. In the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasty exhibition halls, representative works of famous painting masters from various schools from the 14th century to the early 19th century are displayed separately. These include the Qiu Jiao Yin Ma Tu Scroll by the Yuan Dynasty painter Zhao Ziang, the Qian He Ying Lu Tu Scroll by the Ming Dynasty painter Lu Ji, the Feng Mu Tu Scroll by Tang Yin, the Luo Yuan Cao Tang Tu Scroll by Wen Zhengming, and the landscape axis by the late Ming and early Qing Dynasty painter Dong Qichang, the Lotus and Water Bird Tu Scroll by Bada Shanren, and other famous paintings.
    Exquisite Arts and Crafts
    What is dazzling is the variety of exquisite crafts exhibited in the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasty exhibition halls. From the Yuan Dynasty onwards, the development of sea and land transportation and the prosperity of trade with foreign countries stimulated the arts and crafts and entered a prosperous period. The exquisite production of the Beijing palace workshops and the new fashion of commercial cities influenced each other. Some crafts were separated from practical use and produced exclusively for appreciation. New varieties and new styles continued to emerge. Among porcelain, the development of blue and white porcelain using cobalt as raw material and underglaze red using copper as raw material, as well as various colored porcelains, is the most significant achievement. The "Xuan Lu" porcelain of the Xuande period of the Ming Dynasty used Siamese copper as raw material and was fired into scripture, wax tea, and jujube red colors. In addition to inlaying gold and silver, it was also dyed with medicinal materials to imitate the patina of ancient bronzes and the glaze color of Song porcelain, which was very exquisite. Chinese porcelain was exported to foreign countries in large quantities from the Yuan Dynasty, which had a great impact on the porcelain making technology in the world, earning China the reputation of "the motherland of porcelain." Cloisonne enamel (generally known as Jingtai Blue) with diverse shapes, rich patterns, and bright colors is also a new creation. Many fine works by famous craftsmen, such as Zhu Bishan's Silver Raft, Zhang Cheng and Yang Mao's lacquer carvings, Lu Zigang's jade wares, Cheng Junfang and Fang Yulu's ink, are extremely famous.
    In the Qing Dynasty, especially during the Qianlong period in the mid-18th century, the exquisiteness, neatness, and delicacy of arts and crafts developed further. Painting was closely related to craftsmanship. The landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds painted on porcelain, lacquerware, embroidery, and ivory carvings were often drafted by painters. A large bottle with various glazes from the Qianlong period fired various glazes and colors on one piece of porcelain at the same time, reaching a very high level technically. The cut velvet entwined with lotus flowers and plants created by Nanjing weaving workers used two weaving methods, cutting and not cutting, on the colorful velvet surface to express the shades and brightness of the flowers, which looked particularly vivid. The exquisite Su embroidery Qixi Tu, which includes more than 20 kinds of stitches, is a representative work of Su embroidery and is very suitable for expressing meticulous brush paintings. The gorgeous gold-painted lacquerware, the thin-as-paper red lacquerware, the delicate openwork jade ware, the highly decorative painted enamel, and the exquisite handicrafts of ethnic minorities such as felt blankets and Tong decorations were all famous products at that time.
    In the Northwest Chonglou, the last part is introduced - the exhibits from the period after the Opium War to the eve of the "May Fourth" Movement. During this period, due to imperialist aggression and the corruption of the ruling class, traditional arts and crafts were also severely damaged. In terms of painting art, painters centered on Shanghai, a commercial city, developed the traditional freehand painting school, and some painters also attempted to synthesize the strengths of Eastern and Western painting methods to break the traditional scope. Qi Baishi, who was born as a carpenter, was the latest and most accomplished painting master of this period. The Ba Hu Chun Shui Tu Axis exhibited here has already shown his original style. He Shaoji's calligraphy has its own style. New Year pictures and Ni Ren Zhang's clay sculptures were loved by the public. The Dianshizhai Pictorial, which was founded in Shanghai using lithographic printing technology, reported on the situation of China's war against the invading armies of French, Japanese and other imperialists and the situation of the people. It was a new product of this era and had a certain progressive significance at that time. Generally speaking, the changes in culture and art during this period were not very significant. It was not until after the start of the new democratic revolution that a new page was opened in the history of Chinese culture and art.

    五千年艺术的宝库
    ——记故宫博物馆历代艺术馆
    本报记者　余辉音
    在我国最大的艺术博物馆——新近筹备就绪的故宫博物馆历代艺术馆，人们欣赏到了祖国几千年来的艺术精华，就会产生自豪感。
    历代艺术馆设在故宫中路的保和殿东、西两庑和两个崇楼里，集中了故宫博物院收藏和征集的四千多件有代表性的绘画、雕塑、书法、铭刻、铜器、陶瓷、织绣等艺术作品，按照历史的发展，综合地介绍了我国原始社会后期到旧民主主义革命时期各个时代造型艺术和其他艺术的发展。
    劳动工具和造型艺术
    早在四、五千年前我国原始社会后期，手工业和农业就有了初步分工，实用工艺美术已经萌芽。在保和殿的原始社会后期和奴隶社会陈列厅里可以看到，公元前三千至二千年的劳动人民，已经把他们所热爱的石斧、石凿、石镰刀、石箭头等劳动工具，磨得很平滑、实用而又美观，他们还磨制出坚硬的玉斧。黄河流域和沿海一带的居民，已创造了彩陶和黑陶。
    一个用青铜制造的巨大酒器三羊尊，引起人们的注意。它造型雄伟，铸造精工，满身花纹，尊上三个羊头雕镂生动，是公元前十二至十一世纪的商代末年造型艺术的代表。在我国古代文化中占居十分突出地位的青铜文化，对后代文化艺术的发展有着深远的影响。从陈列出的各种青铜器展品上可以看到，商代的青铜器上常常利用自然界各种动物的形象作图案，千变万化。各具巧思，使人感到庄严而又神秘。到战国，青铜器上的图案，开始有了狩猎、攻战、采桑、射箭、饮食、乐舞等比较复杂的生活场面，这是我国古代美术作品第一次直接反映社会现实。
    设在东北崇楼和东庑前部的战国、秦汉时代的展品说明，到封建社会初期，各种实用艺术更加繁盛，文化艺术的发展，逐渐普及全国，与邻近各族间的文化交流一天天多起来。在汉代，石刻盛行。山东出土的公元154年的芗他君石柱，上面所刻的力士像和一些怪兽的线条，已经能够准确地表达形象了。
    书画艺术
    东庑的后部介绍了魏晋至宋代艺术的巨大发展。公元三、四世纪的“魏晋风流”时代，形成了我国封建社会文化艺术发展的第一个高峰。书法和绘画艺术形成了，成为独立的艺术。有名的艺术家很多，欣赏书画艺术已成为当时的社会风尚。大画家顾恺之以洛神赋——著名诗人曹植用神话隐喻失掉了的爱情的美丽的诗篇——作为主题画出的洛神赋卷，由于细致地描写了人的内在情感活动，在古代绘画发展上占有重要的地位。这里陈列的是这幅画卷的宋人摹本中最古的一种：在洛水之滨，曹植和他的侍从们遥遥望见，那寄寓着他的苦恋的美丽的洛水女神，出现在平静的水面上。画面上远水渺渺，洛神似来又去，传达出无限惆怅的神情。这里还陈列了著名的陆机平复帖，是一千七百年前文学家陆机写给友人的信札。它是我国流传下来最早的写在纸上的名人墨迹，可以让我们看到当时的草书形式。陈列出的摹本兰亭帖，原帖是晋代大书法家王羲之的代表作。青瓷在这个时期的出现，是工艺美术发展史上的一件大事。浙江出土的永安3年（公元260年）青釉罐，釉色略带黄，上面堆砌屋宇、人物、飞鸟作为装饰，是魏晋青瓷中代表性作品。
    石窟艺术和金石造像等雕塑艺术，在四世纪以后的东晋、南北朝，有了很大的发展。佛像上庄严慈祥的容貌，流畅飘动的衣裙，显示了雕刻匠师们的创造才能。
    强盛的隋唐时代，随着疆土扩大，交通发展，经济繁荣，文化艺术出现了一个新的高峰，成为我国古代艺术史上绚烂多采的时期。从陈列的隋唐时期的各种艺术品看，人物画与宗教画比过去更加真实、传神，名家很多，风格屡变，山水、畜兽等画都逐渐发展成独立的画科，书法艺术综合南北，楷书法度精严。艺术家们大都有朝气，勇于创造。陈列在这里的画家展子虔的一幅游春图，大约是六世纪末年的作品，是历代保存下来的最古老的一幅山水人物画，描绘出春光明媚的湖山和在山川间纵情游览的人们，色采鲜艳，给人以愉快的感觉。前人评他的画“动笔形似，画外有情”，确很恰当。著名诗人杜牧所写的得意之作张好好诗，行书气格雄健，是很珍贵的墨迹。这个时期，雕塑艺术也有很大的发展。
    工艺美术中青瓷烧造达到了高度水平，还创造了白瓷和三彩陶器。
    从五代到宋代的展品中给人印象最深的是绘画，宋代绘画达到了中国古代绘画艺术发展的高峰，创造了无数巧妙的艺术表现手法，反映了现实生活，比较接近人民群众的爱好。这里陈列的董源的潇湘图、崔白的寒雀图、顾闳中的韩熙载夜宴图、赵佶（宋徽宗）的听琴图，杨补之的四梅图等等，都是当年的珍贵名画。南宋初年画家常借古事来影射当时的政治问题。著名画家李唐的采薇图，取材殷亡国后伯夷叔齐在首阳山采薇，宁可饿死不吃周朝粮的故事，借以提倡政治气节。木匠出身的画家李嵩所作的货郎图，描写出乡村中贩卖百货的货郎担，被母亲和天真活泼的孩子们围绕着，各有各的神情动态。这幅画有着浓厚的民间气息。画家马远的踏歌图描绘老少农民在丰收以后歌舞欢乐的情景，构图简明，笔法劲挺，人物形象十分生动。这个时期书法的发展变化很大，五代的杨凝式草书，豪放不羁。笔力雄强，宋代苏轼、黄庭坚、米芾等的书法都突破了唐人的规格，自成体统。
    封建社会后期的元、明、清三代为数颇多的展品占据了整个西庑。十四世纪以后的元朝和明朝，画家中提倡学古，注重笔墨技法，山水画、兰、竹画盛行。这种风气，直到清朝，仍成为绘画中的主流。艺术家们崇尚多能，往往一身兼备绘画、写字、题诗、刻图章等才能，在一种作品上兼备各种艺术。十五世纪以后，画家中渐渐分出浙派、江夏派、吴门派等地方性流派，十七世纪以后，扬州、上海等商业城市的画家，发展了花卉画中的写意一派。另一方面，由写真画开始，一些画家们逐渐吸收了部分西方画的手法，各自创造新的风格。元、明、清代陈列厅中，分别展出了十四世纪至十九世纪前期各个画派著名的绘画大师们的代表作品。其中包括元代画家赵子昂的秋郊饮马图卷，明代画家吕纪的浅荷鹰鹭图轴、唐寅的风木图卷、文征明的洛原草堂图卷，明末清初画家董其昌的山水轴、八大山人的荷花水鸟图轴等名画。
    精美的工艺美术
    使人眼花撩乱的是元、明、清代陈列厅中展出的各种精美的工艺品。从元代开始，海陆交通的发展和中外贸易的繁荣，使工艺美术受到新的刺激，进入了繁盛的时期。北京宫廷作坊的精工制作和商业都市的新风尚互为影响，一部分工艺品脱离实用专为观赏而生产，新品种和新风格不断出现。瓷器中，以钴作原料的青花和以铜为原料的釉里红，以至各种彩色的瓷器的发展，是最显著的成就，明代宣德年间的“宣炉”瓷器，用暹罗铜等作为原料，烧成藏经、蜡茶、枣红色等，除了镶嵌金银外还用药材点染，以摹仿古铜器的斑锈和宋瓷的釉色，非常精巧，中国瓷器从元代起大量输往外国，对世界上制瓷工艺起了极大影响，使我国赢得了“瓷器的祖国”的声誉。造型多样、纹样丰富、色彩鲜艳的掐丝法琅（一般称景泰蓝）也是新的创造。许多工艺名匠的精作，如朱碧山的银槎、张成、杨茂的漆雕、陆子岗的玉器、程君方、方于鲁的墨，都极为著名。
    在清代，特别是十八世纪中期的乾隆年间，工艺美术品的精致、工整和细巧有了新的发展。绘画与工艺密切联系，瓷器、漆器、织绣及象牙雕刻上的山水、人物、花鸟画，往往由画家起稿。乾隆时的一个各色釉彩大瓶，将各色釉和彩同时烧在一件瓷器上，技术上达到了极高的水平。南京织造工人创造的采妆缠枝莲花卉天鹅绒，在五彩缤纷的绒面上用剪与不剪两种织法表现出花的浓淡明暗，显得分外生动。包括二十多种针法的精美的苏绣七夕图，是苏绣的代表作，非常适宜表现工笔绘画。富丽的描金漆器，胎薄如纸的朱漆器，细巧的镂空玉器，装饰性很强的画法琅，兄弟民族精致的工艺品如毡毯，僮饰等等，都是当时的名产。
    在西北崇楼里，介绍了最后一部分——鸦片战争以后到“五四”前夕的这一时期的展品。这个时期，由于帝国主义的侵略，统治阶级的腐败，传统的工艺美术也遇到严重破坏。绘画艺术方面，以商业都市上海为中心的画家们发展了传统的写意画派，还有一些画家企图综合东西方画法的长处，打破传统的范围。木工出身的齐白石是这个时期中最晚的、成就最大的一位绘画大师，这里展出的巴湖春水图轴，已经显示了他的独创风格。何绍基的书法，自成一格。年画和泥人张的捏塑为大众所喜爱，利用石印技术在上海创刊的点石斋画报，报道我国对法、日等帝国主义侵略军队作战的情况和民间情况，是这个时代的新产品，在当时有一定进步意义。总的说来，这个时期文化艺术的变化，还不很显著。直到新民主主义革命开始以后，我国文化艺术史上才揭开了新的一页。（图片摄影：人民日报北京记者站）（附图片）
