Long Live the Socialist Motherland
Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party

Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our 650 million Chinese people have victoriously traversed ten years on the glorious road of socialism. The great achievements of these ten years have changed the impoverished and blank state of the old China, leading our motherland towards prosperity and happiness, and transforming it from a semi-colonial state subject to bullying into one of independence and strength. We spent a short three years restoring the national economy, which had been severely damaged by long-term war and relentlessly ravaged by imperialism. Subsequently, from 1953 to 1957, we victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan, establishing industrial sectors that never existed before, such as metallurgical equipment manufacturing, mining equipment manufacturing, power generation equipment manufacturing, as well as aircraft, automobile, and modern machine tool manufacturing. This laid the initial foundation for our country's socialist industrialization. At the same time, through the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, our country achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. This unprecedentedly enhanced the political awareness and ideological understanding of the people nationwide, creating a great situation of solid national unity and national unification that had never existed in our country's history. Our great achievements have shaken the world. Our fraternal countries and peace-loving friends are pleased with our country's great achievements. The imperialists and their running dogs tremble at our growing strength. From the beginning of our country's founding, every time we achieve a new victory, they fabricate rumors and slander us. The greater our victory, the more despicable their slander and sabotage become. But rumors are ultimately shattered by facts, and truth ultimately triumphs over fallacy. The more the enemy obstructs and sabotages us, the faster our construction progresses, and the higher our international standing becomes.

As our people across the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with unparalleled heroic spirit, make achievements in their respective positions to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, the imperialists and their running dogs are frantically spreading rumors and slander, conducting various reactionary propaganda campaigns against our overseas Chinese. Their attempt to confuse the overseas Chinese and obliterate our great achievements is, as in the past, futile. Our overseas Chinese have always loved their motherland. They have learned from their long years of living abroad that only a prosperous and strong motherland can improve their status abroad and ensure the effective protection of their legitimate rights and interests. Overseas Chinese have long yearned for a prosperous and strong motherland, but this wish could only be realized after liberation. As the motherland becomes increasingly prosperous and strong, overseas Chinese are increasingly respected abroad. They are no longer overseas "orphans." They receive the infinite care of the motherland, deeply feel the warmth of the motherland, and cherish all the achievements of the motherland. No fabricated rumors can deceive them.

The great decade since the founding of our country has also been a decade of great leaps forward. In particular, in 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line of "Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results in Building Socialism" put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, our people across the country displayed the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, creating unprecedented great achievements in the overall leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, science and technology, and culture and art. This year, all sectors of the national economy are continuing to leap forward on the basis of last year's great leap forward. Last year, our people also created the people's commune, an effective social organization that is beneficial to our current socialist construction and the future transition to communism. The imperialists were panicked by our great achievements and frantically engaged in malicious slander and attacks against our General Line, Great Leap Forward, and people's communes, uttering all kinds of nonsense. But what are the facts? Not only did we achieve an unprecedented great leap forward last year, with the total value of industrial and agricultural output increasing by 48% compared to 1957, steel production (excluding native steel) increasing by 49.5%, coal production increasing by 108%, grain production increasing by 35%, and cotton production increasing by 28%; but also our country's total industrial output value this year will increase by 25.5% compared to last year's great leap forward, and the total agricultural output value will also increase by 10%, that is, continuing to leap forward on the basis of last year's great leap forward. Our people's communes have not only been universally established but have also embarked on the road of consolidation, soundness, and development, and their superiority has become increasingly apparent. Our country's general line for building socialism correctly guides the people throughout the country to achieve great achievements in all aspects. Its brilliance shines all over the country, and it has become an inexhaustible driving force for our people to move forward and a compass for continuing to move toward victory. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are the manifestation of the great determination and great wisdom of our 650 million people, and they are the products of the creative integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of China by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It has achieved great victories, and it will play an even greater role. The imperialist fools cannot obliterate our great achievements with slander and curses, nor can they prevent us from continuing to move forward.

Now, under the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole country are fighting with a hundredfold confidence and soaring enthusiasm to basically complete the main production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year. At present, amazing achievements are constantly being created on all production and construction fronts to welcome the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, and good news of overfulfilling plans is frequently reported. We will certainly be able to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. In this way, we can greatly increase the original targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in the next three years, so that we may be able to achieve the task of "catching up with the UK in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years" in about ten years, and greatly advance and overfulfill the original twelve-year agricultural development program scheduled for 1967. This is such an inspiring and magnificent undertaking.

In the ten years since the founding of the country, the achievements made by our country in socialist revolution and socialist construction have been brilliant, great, and unprecedented. All the achievements we have made are the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I and all members of the Zhi Gong Party must strengthen our self-transformation, actively serve socialism, always and firmly unite around the Party with the people of the whole country, resolutely accept the leadership of the Party, respond to all the calls of the Party with practical actions, and be sure to achieve far more and greater achievements in the next ten years than in the past ten years, making the motherland stronger and the people of the motherland happier.

    社会主义的祖国万岁
    中国致公党主席　陈其尤
    我们六亿五千万中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，已在社会主义的光荣道路上胜利地走过了十年。十年来的伟大成就改变了旧中国的一穷二白的情况，使我们的祖国走向了繁荣和幸福，也从过去任人欺侮的半殖民地状况走上了独立和富强。我们以短短三年的时间恢复了长期战争中被严重破坏和被帝国主义百般摧残了的国民经济，接着又在1953年到1957年期间胜利完成了第一个五年计划，建立起过去从没有过的冶金设备制造业、采矿设备制造业、发电设备制造业以及飞机、汽车和新式机床制造业等等工业部门，奠定了我国社会主义工业化的初步基础。与此同时，经过整风运动和反右派斗争，我们国家又在政治战线和思想战线上取得社会主义革命决定性的胜利，使全国人民的政治觉悟和思想觉悟空前提高，使祖国出现了我国历史上从未有过的牢固的民族团结和全国统一的伟大局面。我们的伟大成就震动全世界。我们的兄弟国家和爱好和平的朋友都为我国的伟大成就而高兴。帝国主义者及其走狗则为我们的日益强大而发抖。从我国建国开始，每逢我们获得一次新的胜利，他们就要造谣污蔑一次，我们的胜利越大，他们的污蔑破坏就愈卑鄙。但谣言终归被事实所粉碎，真理终归战胜了谬论。敌人愈阻挠破坏我们，我们的建设事业前进得愈快，我们的国际地位也愈来愈提高。
    当我们全国人民在中国共产党领导下以无比的英雄气概，在各自岗位上做出成绩来庆贺祖国建国十周年的时候，帝国主义者及其走狗们就疯狂地进行造谣污蔑，向我国海外华侨进行各种反动宣传，他们这种企图混淆华侨视听，抹煞我国伟大成就的叫喊，和过去一样也都是徒劳的。我国华侨一向是热爱祖国的，他们从长期的侨居生活中体会到，只有一个富强的祖国，才能使他们在国外的地位得以提高，他们的正当权益才能得到切实维护。华侨长远以来就渴望着一个富强的祖国，但这种愿望只有在解放后才能实现，随着祖国的日益富强，华侨在海外也日益受到尊重，他们已不再是海外“孤儿”了，他们受到祖国的无限关怀，深深感到祖国的温暖，珍惜祖国的所有成就，任何捏造的谣言是瞒骗不了他们的。
    我国建国以来的伟大的十年，也是跃进的十年。特别是1958年我们全国人民在中国共产党提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义的风格，创造了史无前例的工农业生产和科学技术、文化艺术的全面大跃进的伟大成就。今年，国民经济各个部门又在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。去年，我国人民还创建了人民公社这一有利于我国当前的社会主义建设和今后往共产主义过渡的有效的社会组织。帝国主义者们在我们的伟大成就面前惊慌失措，就疯狂地针对我们的总路线、大跃进和人民公社进行恶毒的污蔑和攻击，发出种种胡言谰语。但事实怎样呢？我们不但去年获得了工农业总产值比1957年增长48％，钢的产量（不包括土钢）增长49.5％，煤的产量增长108％，粮食产量增长35％，棉花产量增长28％的空前大跃进；而且我国今年的工业总产值比大跃进的去年，还将要增长25.5％，农业总产值也将增长10％，也就是在去年大跃进的基础上还要继续大跃进。我们的人民公社不仅普遍建立起来了，而且已经走上了巩固的健全发展的道路，它的优越性越来越显著地发挥了出来。我国建设社会主义总路线，正确地指导着全国人民在各方面取得巨大的成就，它的光辉普照全国，它已成为我国人民前进的无穷动力和继续走向胜利的指南针。总路线、大跃进、人民公社是我国六亿五千万人民的伟大决心和伟大智慧的表现，是共产党和毛主席创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际结合起来的产物。它已取得了伟大的胜利，它还将发挥更大的作用。帝国主义蠢材们用诽谤咒骂既不能抹杀我们的伟大成就，也不可能阻挡我们的继续前进。
    现在，全国人民在共产党八届八中全会的伟大号召下，正以百倍的信心，冲天的干劲为在今年内基本完成第二个五年计划主要的生产指标而奋斗。目前各个生产建设战线上都不断创造出惊人的成绩来迎接伟大的建国十周年，超额完成计划的捷报频传。我们一定能够在今年内即提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标。这样，我们就可以在今后三年中把原定的第二个五年计划的指标大大提高，从而使我们可能在十年左右的时间内，实现“十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的任务，并使原定在1967年实现的十二年农业发展纲要，大大提前超额完成。这是多么振奋人心的宏伟事业。
    建国十年来，我国在社会主义革命方面和社会主义建设方面所获得的成就是辉煌的、巨大的、空前的。我们所获得的一切成就都是共产党和毛主席英明领导的结果。我和致公党全体成员，一定要加强自我改造，积极为社会主义服务，永远和全国人民一道牢固地团结在党的周围，坚决接受党的领导，以实际行动响应党的一切号召，一定要在未来的十年中取得远比过去十年更多更大的成就，使祖国更加强盛，使祖国人民更加幸福。
