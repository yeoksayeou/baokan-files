Give Full Play to the Superiority of the Communes and Change the Decentralized Management of Tribes
Great Development of Animal Husbandry in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

(Reported by this newspaper) The thirty-five people's communes in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are shining brightly, and animal husbandry production in the first half of this year has achieved comprehensive development.

As of the end of June, the prefecture produced more than 260,000 lambs and 150,000 calves of large livestock, with an average survival rate of over 80%, achieving a harvest unprecedented in previous years. This year's breeding work was also started earlier than in previous years. 50% of the 190,000 eligible female livestock in the prefecture have been bred, and sheep breeding has also begun. Currently, it is the peak breeding season, and the majority of herdsmen are determined to fight for three months and strive to basically become a prefecture where all are fully bred and pregnant. Recently, after conscientiously implementing the policy of "equal emphasis on public and private raising," pig and poultry production has quickly rebounded, and the number of pigs in the prefecture has increased by 10.17% compared with May. At the same time, a total of 470,000 head (pieces) of livestock and poultry were treated for disease this spring, exceeding the total during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. Up to now, more than 1.7 million head of livestock in the prefecture have basically eliminated the third category of thinness and transferred all livestock to summer pastures to ensure that each is fat and strong.

Last year, after the realization of people's communes in the prefecture, under the guidance of the provincial party committee's established policy of "Gannan focusing on animal husbandry," a large number of outstanding cadres were transferred to strengthen the grassroots leadership. Since the beginning of spring, a mass animal protection campaign has been widely carried out, and large-scale animal protection inspections have been organized. As many as fifteen specialized animal protection meetings and on-site meetings have been held at the prefectural and county levels, and the advanced animal protection experience of various advanced units has been summarized and promoted in a timely manner, thereby promoting the development of animal husbandry production.

The victory of the people's communes in the Gannan area has completely changed the decentralized situation of tribal feudal separatism in the past, making it easier to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to develop production and construction. With the help of Han cadres, various places have generally established animal husbandry and veterinary work stations, grassland work stations, and artificial insemination stations, etc., and trained more than 3,000 Tibetan veterinary epidemic prevention personnel and artificial insemination personnel, focusing on carrying out artificial insemination of horses and sheep; guiding the masses to promote scientific animal husbandry production methods; dividing four-season pastures, grazing livestock according to their strength, size, and categorizing them into groups, designating special personnel to take care of sick and young livestock, and supplementing feed at the trough, which greatly improved the feeding management of livestock.

When there was a shortage of grass in the spring, each commune carried out communist collaboration between communes and teams in agricultural and pastoral areas according to the principle of "equal exchange." The agricultural area adjusted approximately 200 million catties of grass and fodder to the pastoral area, reducing livestock deaths in the spring. During the livestock calving season, each commune also formed thousands of young livestock breeding groups to improve the survival rate of young livestock. For example, the third production team of the Caike Commune in Taojiang County produced 3,319 lambs, with a survival rate as high as 92.4%.

In the above-mentioned activities, party committees at all levels resolutely relied on the poor herdsmen, selected party members, league members, and youth activists to serve as herdsmen, and conducted in-depth socialist education for them, improving their political awareness and greatly increasing their enthusiasm for production. This spring, more than 20,000 herdsmen participated in epidemic prevention work; and a large number of model figures who loved the commune as their home and loved livestock as their children emerged in each commune. For example, Yang Mao Cuo, a herdsman from the Bazang Commune in Longdie County, personally fed milk to the calves and slept with the calves at night. He worked hard for four days and nights to save a premature calf. Wan Die Cao, a sixteen-year-old female herdsman from the Meiwu Commune, found a cow missing when she returned home from grazing one day. Fearing that it would be eaten by wolves, she ignored the cold and darkness and begged a partner to accompany her to find it overnight. She groped in the dark for half the night and finally found the cow, and then drove the cow into a broken pen, and the two guarded the door until the next morning before leading the cow home. Her heroic deeds were unanimously praised by the people on the grassland, so she was elected as a commune model and promoted to leader of the grazing group.

    发挥公社优越性　改变部落分散经营
    甘南藏族自治州畜牧业大发展
    本报讯　甘南藏族自治州三十五个人民公社大放光芒，今年上半年畜牧业生产获得了全面发展。
    截至6月底，全州产羔羊二十六万余只，大家畜产仔十五万头，平均成活率都在80％以上，取得历年未有的丰收。今年的配种工作也比往年抓得早，全州大家畜中的十九万头适龄母畜已有50％配了种，羊只配种工作业已开始；目前，正值配种旺季，广大牧民决心奋战三月，力争基本成为全配满怀州。近一时期，在认真贯彻“公养私养并重”的方针以后，猪禽生产很快回升，全州生猪头数较5月份增长10.17％。同时，今春共防治畜禽四十七万头（只），超过了第一个五年计划期间的总和。到目前为止，全州一百七十多万头牲畜已基本上消灭了三类膘，并将全部牲畜转入夏季牧场，抓好秋膘，保证个个膘肥体壮。
    去年，全州实现人民公社化后，在省委确定的“甘南以畜牧业为主”的方针指导下，抽调大批优秀干部充实了基层领导。入春以来，广泛地开展了群众性的保畜运动，组织保畜大检查，仅召开的州、县级保畜专业会议和现场会议即达十五次之多，及时总结推广各先进单位的保畜经验，从而促进了畜牧业生产的发展。
    甘南地区人民公社化的胜利，彻底改变了过去部落封建割据的分散局面，便于集中人力、物力、财力以发展生产建设。各地在汉族干部的帮助下，普遍成立了畜牧兽医工作站、草原工作站、人工授精站等机构，培训出三千多名藏族兽医防疫员和人工授精员，重点开展了马匹和绵羊的人工受精工作；指导群众推广科学的牧业生产方法；划分四季牧场，按照牲畜强弱、大小，分类分群放牧，对病幼牲畜指定专人护理，槽头补饲，大大改善了牲畜的饲养管理。
    当春季缺草时，各公社根据“等价交换”的原则，在农牧地区开展了社与社、队与队的共产主义大协作，农业区共计给牧业区调剂草料约二亿斤，减少了牲畜春天死亡现象。在牲畜产仔季节，各公社还组成数以千计的幼畜接育小组，提高了幼畜成活率。如洮江县才科公社第三生产队产羊羔三千三百十九只，成活率高达92.4％。
    在上述各项活动中，各级党委坚决依靠了贫苦牧民群众，选派党团员和青年积极分子充当放牧员，并对他们深入地进行了社会主义教育，提高了政治觉悟，生产热情十分高涨。今春参加防疫工作的牧民群众即达两万余人；而且各公社涌现出大批爱社如家、爱畜如子的模范人物。如龙迭县巴藏公社放牧员杨毛措，亲口给牛犊喂奶，晚上和牛犊睡在一起，辛苦了四昼夜，才把一头早产牛犊救活。美武公社十六岁的女放牧员万蝶草，一天放牛回家发现丢失一头牛，她惟恐被狼吃掉，便不顾天寒夜黑，恳求一位小伙伴陪她连夜去找，一直摸了半夜黑路，终于把牛找到，随即把牛赶进一个破圈，两人守在门口，翌晨才牵牛回家。她的英雄事迹，受到草原上的人们一致赞扬，因此被大家评选为公社模范，提升为放牧组长。
