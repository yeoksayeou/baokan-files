The Gan-Nan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, under the leadership of the Party, shattered the counter-revolutionary elements' rebellious and sinister plot to prevent the wheels of history from advancing. It thoroughly destroyed the reactionary feudal forces, enabling Gan-Nan to leap from a feudal society with remnants of slavery directly into a socialist society. It also realized the people's commune system, thus ending the history of ethnic tragedy in Gan-Nan and embarking on the road to prosperity and happiness that people had hoped for for thousands of years.

The feudal forces in the Gan-Nan area held absolute dominance in politics, economy, and culture before liberation. The main means of production, such as land, grasslands, forests, livestock, and houses, were mostly occupied by feudal lords. In pastoral areas, the exploiting class accounted for 31.51% of the total population but possessed 66.77% of the total livestock. Impoverished herdsmen accounted for 43.75% of the total population but possessed only 7.64% of the total livestock. Therefore, the possession of means of production in the entire prefecture was extremely concentrated, and class divisions were very clear. The vast number of farmers and herdsmen suffered various economic exploitations and burdens, amounting to about 60% to 90% of their total income. In addition, feudal lords generally had courts and prisons, arbitrarily imposing various tortures on the masses. One "court" even had 253 kinds of cruel punishments. For a long time, people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture groaned under this barbaric rule and exploitation.

In the years since liberation, the Party, adhering to the working principle of prudence and stability in the Gan-Nan area, correctly implemented the policies of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief. It vigorously supported poor farmers and herdsmen in establishing their livelihoods in all aspects, enabling production to develop and living standards to improve. The policy of unity, education, and transformation has always been adopted towards upper-class figures, and necessary care has been given to them in terms of political status and economic life. We patiently helped and waited for their progress. Some people, under the Party's patient education, have made great progress. They gradually abandoned exploitation and privileges and supported democratic reform. We have always welcomed these people. However, the reactionary elements among them stubbornly adhered to their class positions. They consistently used arson, killing, and looting to intimidate the Party and the government, coerce the masses, and openly prevent people of all ethnic groups from entering a happy socialist society. However, their various persecutions of the revolutionary people only aroused greater anger among the people. Under these circumstances, the people of all ethnic groups in Gan-Nan ignited the flames of democratic reform in the summer of 1958. Through democratic reform, the broad masses of people have been fundamentally liberated in terms of politics, economy, and other aspects. Subsequently, at the enthusiastic request of the farmers and herdsmen, the entire prefecture quickly realized the people's commune system.

After thoroughly completing the democratic reform and realizing the commune system, agricultural and pastoral production in Gan-Nan achieved a leap forward in development. The number of livestock in the prefecture has increased from one million head in the early days of liberation to more than 1.7 million head now. The average yield per mu of grain crops reached 245 jin last year, an increase of 18.1% compared to 1957. For the first time in Gan-Nan's history, there was a surplus of grain for self-sufficiency. Since the establishment of the first modern machine industry—the Gan-Nan Dairy Factory—in 1957, the prefecture now has 78 machine factories. People's living standards, ideological and moral outlook, and customs have all undergone rapid and significant changes. The facts of the past year fully demonstrate that implementing democratic reform and resolutely taking the socialist road is the people's sincere and urgent demand for ethnic minorities, and it is also the necessary path and fundamental guarantee for the development and prosperity of all ethnic groups.

In leading this democratic reform movement, we mainly grasped the following three basic links:

First, unswervingly implement the Party's various policies and guidelines in ethnic minority areas, especially the policies and guidelines on democratic reform and socialist construction. A large number of facts prove that the ethnic issue is actually a class issue. To achieve true liberation, all ethnic groups must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, eliminate the exploiting class and the social system of exploitation, and establish a socialist and even communist society. This is the inevitable path for all ethnic groups and the law of social development. Only by taking this path can the nation prosper, the differences between advanced and backward ethnic groups gradually disappear, and the days of harmonious and seamless relations between all ethnic groups be fully realized. The characteristics of ethnic minority areas must be taken into account when carrying out democratic reform. Marxism-Leninism requires us to creatively apply various policies and principles based on the historical conditions of each ethnic group and not to copy or mechanically apply the work experience of other regions. Ignoring this point will lead to detachment from life and the masses, causing losses to the Party's cause. However, we must never avoid or waver in guiding people of all ethnic groups onto the socialist road, this fundamental principle, because of ethnic peculiarities and backwardness. Therefore, in the Gan-Nan area, we have consistently criticized the erroneous ideas that emphasize ethnic peculiarities and backwardness, attempting to reject or slow down democratic reform. Through a large number of facts about class antagonism, we have strengthened the theoretical education of class struggle within and outside the Party, and mobilized them to study Marxist-Leninist theories related to ethnic issues and Gan-Nan's reality. We have continuously conducted socialist ideological education among the broad masses, which has improved the political awareness and ideological level of cadres and the masses, laying the foundation for resolutely implementing the Party's policies and carrying out democratic reform.

Second, implement the Party's class line, fully mobilize the people of all ethnic groups, carry out extensive and in-depth democratic movements, and use the methods of large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters to clarify right and wrong, improve the people's level of ideological understanding, and isolate and divide the enemy. The working people of Gan-Nan suffered deeply from the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class, and their will to oppose feudalism was also the most resolute. They are the basic force that the Party relies on. The broad masses of people who were mobilized became a huge revolutionary force for democratic reform. A poor herdsman in Taojiang County complained, "I am a shepherd, and today the shepherd wants to speak!" The stormy mass movement swept across the prefecture with the force of a thunderbolt, which is the most important reason for the complete victory of democratic reform.

Third, resolutely rely on and strengthen the revolutionary forces of all ethnic groups. In the years since liberation, the Party has developed more than 1,700 Party members and more than 2,200 Communist Youth League members among ethnic minorities and cultivated more than 1,500 cadres from their own ethnic groups, who account for more than one-third of all cadres. These comrades are the backbone force in democratic reform. They have a firm stance, are familiar with the local situation, have close ties with the people of all ethnic groups, and fully demonstrated their active role in democratic reform. This makes us even more aware of the importance of cultivating cadres from ethnic minorities in ethnic minority work. At the same time, democratic reform has also generally trained the masses, and more than 22,000 activists have emerged. The vast majority of them are from poor families. They are a new force in the prefecture and a valuable asset to the country. These ethnic minority cadres and outstanding individuals among the masses have significantly improved in terms of political awareness, policy level, and professional ability after being trained by democratic reform. They have played an important role in both democratic reform and the current socialist construction cause.

Gan-Nan's original economic foundation was very weak, and the implementation of democratic reform and socialist construction was relatively late, but those who come later must surpass those who came before. Chairman Mao told us: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper has no burden and is easy to write the newest and most beautiful words and to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures!"

Now, the 340,000 people of all ethnic groups in Gan-Nan are building a happy socialist homeland in this rich and beautiful place with their own hardworking hands, writing the newest and most beautiful words, and drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures!

    社会主义道路是民族繁荣的根本保证
    中共甘南藏族自治州委员会第一书记  谢占儒
    甘南藏族自治州由于各族人民在党的领导下，粉碎了企图阻止历史车轮前进的反革命分子的叛乱罪恶阴谋，彻底摧毁了反动的封建势力，使甘南由带奴隶制残余的封建社会，一跃而跨入社会主义社会，并实现了人民公社化，从而结束了甘南民族悲剧的历史，走上了人们千百年来所希望的繁荣幸福的大道。
    甘南地区的封建势力，解放前不论在政治、经济和文化方面，都占着绝对的统治地位。主要生产资料如土地、草原、森林、牲畜、房屋等，绝大多数为封建主所占有。在牧区中，剥削阶级占总人口的31.51％，却占总牲畜量的66.77％；赤贫牧民占总人口的43.75％，而只占总牲畜量的7.64％。所以全州生产资料占有极为集中，阶级划分十分明显。广大农牧民群众所受的名目繁多的各种经济剥削和负担，要达总收入的60％至90％左右。此外，封建主们普遍设有法庭和监狱，对群众任意施行各种酷刑，有一个“法庭”竟设有二百五十三种残酷的刑法。全州各族人民长时期内在这种野蛮的统治和剥削中呻吟着。
    解放几年来，党在甘南地区本着慎重稳进的工作方针，正确地贯彻了民族平等和宗教信仰自由政策，从各方面大力扶助贫苦农牧民建立家业，使生产有了发展，生活得到改善。对上层人士一直采取了团结教育改造的政策，在政治地位和经济生活上，都给予了必要的照顾，我们耐心地帮助和等待他们的进步。有些人在党的耐心教育下，有了很大的进步，他们逐渐放弃了剥削和特权，拥护民主改革。对这些人我们始终是欢迎的。但他们中间的反动分子，却顽固地坚持其阶级立场，他们一贯以烧杀抢劫来恐吓党和政府，威逼群众，公开阻止各民族人民进入幸福的社会主义社会。但是，他们对于革命人民的种种迫害，只能激起人民更大的愤怒。甘南各族人民在这种情况下，于1958年夏燃起了民主改革的烈火。经过民主改革，广大群众在政治、经济等各方面得到了根本性的解放。接着，全州在农牧民群众的热烈要求下，很快就实现了人民公社化。
    在彻底完成了民主改革和实现公社化后，甘南农牧业生产得到了飞跃的发展。全州牲畜已从解放初期的一百万头，增至现在的一百七十余万头；粮食作物平均亩产去年已达到二百四十五斤，比1957年增产18.1％，在甘南历史上第一次出现了粮食自给有余的局面。从1957年建立第一个现代化机器工业——甘南乳品厂起，现在全州已有了七十八个机器工厂。人民生活水平、思想道德面貌和风俗习惯，都起了急骤的重大变化。一年来的事实充分证明：实行民主改革，坚决走社会主义的道路，是少数民族人民切身的迫切要求，也是各民族获得发展和繁荣的必经途径和根本保证。
    在领导这次民主改革运动中，我们主要抓住了以下三个基本环节：
    第一，坚定不移地贯彻执行党在少数民族地区的各项政策方针，特别是关于民主改革和社会主义建设的政策方针。大量的事实证明：民族问题实际是一个阶级问题。各民族要取得真正的解放，必须在共产党的领导下，消灭剥削阶级和人剥削人的社会制度，建立社会主义以至共产主义社会。这是各族人民必走的道路，也是社会发展的规律。只有走这条路，民族才能繁荣，各民族间先进与落后的差别才能逐渐消失，各民族融洽无间的日子才能全部实现。在进行民主改革的时候，民族地区的特点是要照顾的。马克思列宁主义要求我们根据每个民族的历史条件，创造性地运用各项政策原则，不能抄袭或硬搬别的地区的工作经验。忽视这一点就会脱离生活、脱离群众，使党的事业造成损失。但我们绝不能因为民族特殊和落后，而回避或动摇引导各族人民走社会主义道路的这个根本原则。所以在甘南地区，我们自始至终批判了强调民族特殊和落后、企图拒绝或者放慢民主改革等错误思想；并通过阶级对立的大量事实，在党内外加强阶级斗争的理论教育，发动他们研究马克思列宁主义有关民族理论政策和甘南实际；在广大群众中不断进行社会主义思想教育，这就提高了干部和群众的政治觉悟和思想水平，为坚决执行党的政策和进行民主改革奠定了基础。
    第二，贯彻党的阶级路线，充分发动各族群众，开展广泛深入的民主运动，采用大鸣大放大辩论大字报的方式，辩明是非，提高群众思想认识水平，孤立和分化敌人。甘南劳动群众受反动统治阶级的压迫剥削深重，因而要求反封建的意志也最坚决，他们是党依靠的基本力量。发动起来的广大群众，就成为一支巨大的民主改革的革命队伍。洮江县一个贫苦牧工诉苦说：“我是牧羊人，今天牧羊人要说话了！”暴风雨般的群众运动，以雷霆万钧之势席卷了全州，这是民主改革获得彻底胜利的最重要的原因。
    第三，坚决地依靠和壮大各民族的革命力量。解放几年来，党在少数民族中发展了一千七百余名党员、两千二百余名共青团员，培养了一千五百余名本民族干部，这批干部占全体干部的三分之一以上。这些同志是民主改革中的坚强骨干力量。他们立场坚定，熟悉当地情况，与各族人民有密切的联系，在民主改革中充分显示出他们的积极作用。这使我们更加认识到在少数民族工作中，培养本民族干部的重要意义。同时，通过民主改革也普遍锻炼了群众，涌现出两万二千多名积极分子。他们绝大多数是贫苦家庭出身，是全州的一支新生力量，也是国家的宝贵财富。这批民族干部和群众中的优秀分子，经过民主改革的锻炼，不论在政治觉悟、政策水平和业务能力等方面，都有了显著提高。他们在民主改革和目前的社会主义建设事业中，都发挥了重要作用。
    甘南原来的经济基础非常薄弱，民主改革和社会主义建设的进行也比较晚，但是，后来者一定要居上。毛主席告诉我们：“穷则思变，要干，要革命，一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图！”
    现在甘南三十四万各族人民，正以自己勤劳的双手，在甘南这块富饶美丽的地方，建设社会主义的幸福家园，写最新最美的文字，画最新最美的画图！
