Xinhua News Agency, September 16th, TASS Washington, September 15th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, arrived in Washington today for an official visit to the United States at the invitation of U.S. President Eisenhower.

Khrushchev, along with his family and entourage, arrived on the Soviet TU-114 aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington at 12:21 pm local time (Editor's note: 0:21 am, September 16th, Beijing time).

Welcoming him at the airport were: U.S. President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Herter, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Lodge, and other officials, as well as Soviet Ambassador to the United States Menshikov.

Soviet and American flags were flying at Andrews Air Force Base. There was also an honor guard composed of troops from the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. Long before the plane arrived, thousands of residents of the American capital had arrived at the airport, ready to welcome the historic moment of the meeting between the leaders of the two great powers. Hundreds of journalists and newsreel cameramen from American and other countries' newspapers, radio stations, and television stations were also at the airport awaiting this moment.

U.S. President Eisenhower warmly greeted the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, and his wife, Khrushcheva, at the foot of the ramp. The leaders of the two great powers shook hands in greeting. Director of the U.S. Government's Office of Protocol, Buchanan, introduced the official welcoming party at the airport. Then, Khrushchev and Eisenhower inspected the honor guard. The bands played the national anthems of the Soviet Union and the United States, and a 21-gun salute was fired in honor of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev and Eisenhower walked to the podium.

Eisenhower delivered a brief speech. He welcomed Khrushchev, his family, and his entourage on behalf of the U.S. government and the American people.

The President said: "I look forward to the talks we will hold together, and while we will not negotiate any matters relating to the interests of other countries, I believe that a full and frank exchange of views on many issues may help to increase mutual understanding of unresolved international problems."

Eisenhower went on to say, "You will find that I am deeply convinced that our people, like the people of your country, want to live in a just peace."

The President concluded by saying, "Our common goal should always be a just, universal, and lasting peace. Mr. Chairman, it is in this spirit that I welcome you and say to you, Washington and America welcome you."

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a reply.

Khrushchev said, "We come to you with an honest heart and good wishes. The Soviet people hope to live in peace and friendship with the American people."

There are no obstacles that can prevent the establishment of good neighborly relations between our two countries. The people of the Soviet Union and the United States, along with the people of other countries, once fought well side by side against a common enemy during World War II, defeating the enemy. In a peaceful environment, our two peoples have even more reason and more possibility to be friendly and cooperative.

Khrushchev pointed out that the people of all countries are deeply concerned about defending and consolidating peace and peaceful coexistence. War will not bring any benefit to anyone, while peace is beneficial to the people of all countries. We believe that the leaders of all countries should follow this basic principle in order to realize the hopes of the people of all countries.

Khrushchev believed that the Soviet Union's launching of a cosmic rocket to the moon was a historically significant achievement of peaceful science, which not only the Soviet people but all those who cherish peace and the friendship of the people of all countries are happy about. The launching of the Soviet atomic icebreaker specifically embodies the desire of the people of all countries that nuclear energy should only be used for peaceful purposes.

Khrushchev concluded by saying, "You and I should live in peace and friendship, just as the people of all countries living on our common mother, the Earth, should live in peace and friendship."

Thousands of Americans at the airport greeted Khrushchev's speech with thunderous applause.

After the solemn welcoming ceremony at the airport, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, and Khrushcheva, accompanied by U.S. President Eisenhower, left Andrews Air Force Base in a convertible automobile amidst the cheers of well-wishers and headed for the American capital, Washington.

Along the beautiful forest road from the airport to the city, many people stood. As soon as the car carrying Khrushchev and Eisenhower entered the capital, crowds of welcomers lined the streets in dense rows. The welcoming crowds included students from nearby schools, workers, and staff. Well-wishers packed the sidewalks, stood on the balconies of residences, and some of the more enthusiastic even climbed trees. Everywhere there was applause, cheers, and friendly smiles welcoming Khrushchev.

A long line of cars drove to Blair House, where distinguished guests of the U.S. government usually stay. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, will stay here during his visit to Washington.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th, TASS Washington, September 15th: The press group of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the press secretary of the U.S. President issued the following communiqué to the press:

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, and U.S. President Eisenhower held a meeting at the White House on the afternoon of September 15th, lasting nearly two hours.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the U.S. President discussed issues relating to the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and exchanged views in general on the international situation. They reached an agreement on the general direction of future talks, which will be held after Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, returns from visiting various parts of the United States. To this end, they plan to hold talks at Camp David from the evening of Friday, September 25th, to noon on September 27th.

The atmosphere of the talks was friendly and frank. It has been agreed that future talks will continue in this spirit to seek ways to achieve better mutual understanding.

    赫鲁晓夫到达华盛顿
    苏美领导人开始会谈，就两国关系和国际局势交换意见
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社华盛顿15日讯：苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫今天到达华盛顿，他是应美国总统艾森豪威尔的邀请到美国作正式访问的。
    赫鲁晓夫和他的家属以及随行人员乘坐的苏联图—114式飞机，在当地时间十二点二十一分（编者注：北京时间16日零时二十一分）在华盛顿附近的安德鲁斯机场着陆。
    在机场欢迎的有：美国总统艾森豪威尔、国务卿赫脱、美国常驻联合国代表洛奇和其他官员、苏联驻美大使缅希科夫。
    安德鲁斯机场上悬挂着苏美两国国旗。在机场还有由美国陆海空三军部队和海军陆战队组成的仪仗队。在飞机飞抵机场之前很久，美国首都的几千名居民就已经来到这里，准备欢迎苏联首脑。数以百计的美国和其他国家的报纸、广播电台和电视台的记者和新闻纪录片摄影记者也在机场上等待着两大国首脑会见这具有历史性的时刻。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔站在机梯旁热烈欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的夫人赫鲁晓娃。两大国首脑互相握手表示祝贺。美国政府典礼局局长布坎南介绍了机场上欢迎的官方人士。然后，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔检阅了仪仗队。乐队奏起苏美两国国歌，为欢迎苏联部长会议主席鸣礼炮二十一响。
    赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔走上讲台。
    艾森豪威尔发表了简短的演说。他代表美国政府和美国人民对赫鲁晓夫、他的家属和他的随行人员表示欢迎。
    总统说：“我期待着我们将一起举行的会谈，虽然我们将不谈判任何同其他国家的利益有关的问题，但是我相信，就许多问题充分地、坦率地交换意见，可能有助于增进双方对国际上未解决的问题的了解。”
    艾森豪威尔接着说，您会发现我深信这一点，即我们的人民和贵国人民一样希望生活在正义的和平之中。
    总统最后说，我们共同的目的应该永远是公正的、普遍的和持久的和平。主席先生，正是本着这种精神我欢迎您并向您说，华盛顿和美国欢迎您。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫致答词。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们怀着一颗坦率的心和美好的愿望来到你们这里。苏联人民希望同美国人民和平而友好地相处。
    没有任何障碍能够阻挡我们两国的关系建立成睦邻关系。苏美两国人民同其他国家人民在第二次世界大战期间曾经很好地并肩作战反对共同的敌人，击溃敌人。在和平的环境中我们两国人民更有理由，更有可能友好和合作。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，各国人民都深切关怀保卫和巩固和平与和平共处。战争不会给任何人带来任何好处，而和平有利于各国人民。我们认为，各国国家领导人应该遵循这一基本原则，以实现各国人民的希望。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，苏联向月球发射的宇宙火箭是和平科学具有历史意义的成就，不仅仅苏联人民而且所有珍视和平与各国人民友谊的人都为之高兴。苏联原子破冰船的下水具体地体现了各国人民的愿望，即核能只能用于和平的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我和您应该和平友好相处，就像居住在我们共同的母亲——地球上的各国人民应该和平友好相处一样。
    机场上数千名美国人以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎赫鲁晓夫的讲话。
    机场上隆重的会见仪式结束后，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和赫鲁晓娃在美国总统艾森豪威尔的陪同下乘敞篷汽车在欢迎者的欢呼声中离开安德鲁斯机场前往美国首都华盛顿。
    从机场到城市沿途美丽的森林地上，站着许多人。当赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔乘坐的汽车刚一驶入首都，欢迎的人群沿着街道排成密密的行列，欢迎的人群中有附近学校的学生、工人和职员。欢迎者挤满了人行道，站在住宅的凉台上，有些更积极的人甚至爬到树上。到处是欢迎赫鲁晓夫的掌声、欢呼声和友好的微笑。
    一长串汽车驶到布莱亚大厦，美国政府贵宾通常都在这里下榻。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在访问华盛顿期间将住在这里。
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社华盛顿15日讯：苏联部长会议主席新闻组和美国总统新闻秘书向报界发表了如下的公报：
