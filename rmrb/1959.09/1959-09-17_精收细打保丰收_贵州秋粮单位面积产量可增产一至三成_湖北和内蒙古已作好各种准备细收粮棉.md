    Careful Harvesting and Threshing to Ensure a Bumper Harvest
    Guizhou's Autumn Grain Yield Per Unit Area May Increase by 10% to 30%
    Hubei and Inner Mongolia Have Made Various Preparations for Careful Harvesting of Grain and Cotton
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou's mountainous areas have fully begun autumn harvesting. At the foot of the Miao Mountains and along the Wujiang River, the sound of threshing and the songs of celebration by people of all ethnic groups can be heard everywhere. As of September 8th, the province had harvested over 700,000 mu of rice and over 1.7 million mu of corn. Judging from the harvest situation in various places, the yield per unit area of autumn grain is generally 10% to 30% higher than in the Great Leap Forward year of last year.
    In the autumn harvest, people of all ethnic groups have learned from the lessons of the waste caused by rough harvesting last year and have adopted various measures to ensure a bumper harvest. This year, Guizhou Province's autumn harvest crops were planted in a timely manner, and the maturity period was generally advanced. Various places have put forward the slogan of "reaping as soon as ripe, rushing to harvest and thresh," so that one piece is harvested when it is ripe, avoiding grain bursting and scattering waste. In the spirit of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, all people's communes in the province have unified labor arrangements and vigorously organized cooperation, fully demonstrating the great superiority of the communes. Bawang Commune in Tongren County has 17 plain production teams with early-maturing rice, and 13 high mountain teams with late-maturing rice. Based on the principle of equal value exchange, the commune transferred more than 3,100 laborers from the 13 high mountain teams, bringing their own tools, to assist in the timely harvesting of rice in the plain teams. Due to the extensive cooperation between teams and groups in Datong Management District of Yingsuoxi Commune in Sinan County, more than 1,500 mu of rice were harvested in just four days, accounting for 76% of the sown area.
    During the autumn harvest, various places have paid special attention to improving harvesting and threshing techniques to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain returns home. Many communes have timely overcome the erroneous idea of some commune members who believed that it did not matter if a few grains were scattered, by implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Many communes, from harvesting to storage, have formulated specific measures through discussions with commune members, requiring light cutting and gentle placement during harvesting, leaving no grain behind; threshing should universally adopt the method of threshing within mats to prevent scattering; drying should be supervised by dedicated personnel to prevent livestock and poultry from spoiling; transportation and storage should also be done well, so that grain can be stored in a timely manner to prevent mold and other losses.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the cotton-growing areas of Hubei Province are actively preparing for the cotton harvest, welcoming the peak season. Communes everywhere have universally educated members about careful harvesting and picking, ensuring that every boll is brought into storage, and have established specialized teams for each step of the cotton harvesting process—picking, drying, storage, and ginning. Various tools for harvesting and drying cotton, as well as cotton warehouses, have been basically prepared in many places. Many communes have added new cotton gins and repaired old cotton gins, ensuring that drying, ginning, and storage can be completed in one go. Cotton purchasing departments located in various cotton-producing areas have also carried out a series of organizational preparations before the new cotton comes on the market, training a large number of cotton harvesting technicians to ensure that new cotton is received as soon as it arrives, implementing the policy of "pricing according to quality, better quality for better price," and completing the state's cotton purchasing tasks as scheduled.
    From the Jianghan Plain to the cotton-growing areas of eastern and northwestern Hubei, the vast majority of the more than 8 million mu of cotton is growing well, promising a bumper harvest. This is the result of the people's communes fully leveraging the great potential of manpower, materials, and land, and overcoming various natural disasters. When the cotton seedlings had just emerged, they were attacked by strong winds and heavy rain. Communes everywhere immediately mobilized to fight floods and protect seedlings, draining water and rescuing them. In some places, cotton was sown and flooded, and then sown again, being flooded and sown four or five times. From the time the cotton plants began to flower and boll, the people's communes in the cotton-growing areas, under unified leadership and mutual cooperation, universally launched a drought resistance campaign that lasted for more than three months, defeating the severe drought and overcoming insect pests that were rare in recent years.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are using practical actions to ensure a bumper harvest of autumn crops, welcoming the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    In Bayannur League and the area south of Daqing Mountain, where the climate is relatively warm, the autumn harvest battle has begun successively. In the Hetao area of Bayannur League, the 520,000 mu of oil crops have fully begun, and millet and rice have begun to be harvested. The 150,000-strong labor force here is determined to work hard and skillfully for 20 days to completely harvest the autumn crops. In Xilin Gol League, which is mainly engaged in animal husbandry, people of all ethnic groups are stepping up the harvesting of very robust forage crops, striving for "ten percent harvest in a ten-year harvest." People of all ethnic groups in the people's communes in the northern alpine region are gearing up and stepping up preparations for the autumn harvest. People's communes in Zhaowuda League have repaired more than 8,000 large carts and prepared more than 2,100 threshing grounds. A large number of carpenters and blacksmiths are rushing to make autumn harvest tools.
    While harvesting, commune members throughout the autonomous region are also seizing the time to prepare for a bumper harvest next year. In Bayannur League, more than 1.56 million mu of summer fallow land has been plowed, accounting for more than 80% of the summer fallow land area, of which 270,000 mu has been plowed twice. Some commune members in Zhaowuda League are rushing to accumulate fertilizer, and in recent days, they have accumulated more than 1.1 billion jin of fertilizer every day.

    精收细打保丰收
    贵州秋粮单位面积产量可增产一至三成
    湖北和内蒙古已作好各种准备细收粮棉
    据新华社讯　贵州山区全面开始秋收。苗岭山麓，乌江两岸，到处都可以听到“蓬蓬”的打谷声和各族社员欢庆丰收的歌声。到9月8日止，全省已收获水稻七十多万亩，玉米一百七十多万亩。从各地收获的情况来看，秋粮单位面积产量，一般比大跃进的去年增产一成至三成。
    各族社员在秋收中接受了去年由于收获粗糙造成一些浪费的教训，采取了各种措施，确保丰产丰收。今年贵州省秋收作物种植及时，成熟期普遍提前。各地提出随熟随收、抢收抢打的口号，做到熟一块收一块，避免子粒爆裂造成抛撒浪费。全省各人民公社根据统筹兼顾的精神，统一安排劳力，大力组织协作，充分显示了公社的巨大优越性。铜仁县坝黄公社有十七个平坝生产队水稻成熟较早，十三个高山队水稻成熟较晚，公社本着等价交换的原则，从十三个高山队调了三千一百多个劳力，自带工具，到平坝队及时协助抢收水稻。思南县英所溪公社大同管理区由于广泛开展了队和队、组和组之间的协作，四天时间就抢收了一千五百多亩水稻，占播种面积76％。
    在秋收中，各地特别注意了改进收打技术，做到精收细打，颗粒还家。许多公社通过贯彻党的八届八中全会决议精神，及时克服了部分社员认为抛撒几颗粮食没有关系的错误想法。许多公社从收割到入仓，都通过社员讨论，订出具体措施，割要轻割轻放，一颗不丢；打要普遍采用围席打谷，防止抛撒；晒要专人看守，免得牲畜、家禽糟踏；运和藏也要搞好，使粮食及时入仓，防止霉烂和其他损失。
    据新华社讯　湖北省各棉区正在积极做好收花准备工作，迎接收花旺季到来。各地公社普遍向社员进行了细收细摘、朵朵归仓的教育，并按收花程序——摘花、晒花、保管、轧制等，分别成立了各套专业班子。各种收花、晒花应用工具和棉花库房，在许多地方也基本准备就绪。很多公社都添置了新的轧棉机，修整了旧轧棉机，做到晒干、轧制、入库能一气呵成。分布在各产棉区的棉花收购部门，也在新棉上市前进行了一系列的组织准备工作，培训了大批收花技术员，保证新棉随到随收，执行“依质论价，优质优价”政策，如期完成国家棉花收购任务。
    自江汉平原到鄂东、鄂西北各棉区，八百多万亩棉花绝大部分生长良好，丰收在望。这是人民公社充分发挥人力、物力、地力的巨大潜力，战胜各种自然灾害取得的结果。当棉花幼苗刚出土时，就遇到了狂风暴雨的袭击，各地公社立即动员起来抗涝护苗，排水抢救。有些地方的棉花淹了又种、种上又淹，连淹连种达四、五次。从棉株开花结铃时起，各棉区人民公社又统一领导，互相协作，普遍展开了持续三个多月的抗旱斗争，击退大旱，并且战胜了几年来少有的虫害。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区各族社员正以保证大秋作物丰产丰收的实际行动，迎接伟大的建国十周年。
    气候比较暖和的巴彦淖尔盟和大青山以南地区，秋收战役已经相继展开。巴彦淖尔盟河套地区的五十二万亩油料作物已经全面登场，糜子和水稻已经开镰收割。这里的十五万劳动大军，决心大干巧干二十天，把大秋作物全面割完。以畜牧业为主的锡林郭勒盟，各族社员正在加紧收割十分茁壮的饲料作物，力争“十成年景十成收”。北部高寒地区的人民公社各族社员，正在秣马厉兵，加紧秋收准备工作。昭乌达盟各人民公社已修好大车八千多辆，做好脱粒场二千一百多个，大批木匠、铁匠正在赶制秋收工具。
    全自治区社员在秋收的同时，还抓紧时间为明年大丰收作准备。巴彦淖尔盟的夏茬地已经翻耕了一百五十六万多亩，占夏茬地面积80％以上，其中有二十七万亩已翻了二遍。昭乌达盟一部分社员正在突击积肥，最近几天，每天积肥十一亿多斤。
