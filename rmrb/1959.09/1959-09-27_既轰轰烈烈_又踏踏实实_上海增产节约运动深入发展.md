This reporter reports from Shanghai on the 26th: The current production increase and thrift campaign on Shanghai's industrial front is generally in good shape. The high tide is rapidly advancing, development is healthy, and quite a few experiences have been gained.

    The Party's call to "oppose right-leaning tendencies, encourage vigor, and vigorously promote production increase and thrift" is the great political driving force of this movement. In the past two months, cadres and workers in all walks of life in the city have been in high spirits. The vast majority of factories have held mass meetings, mobilizing the masses to formulate guarantees and measures to complete state plans ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. The annual target for the city's total industrial output value this year, calculated based on the tasks assigned by the central government, is a 34% increase over last year. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee analyzed the current situation and various favorable conditions, proposing to strive to reach or exceed a 40% increase. Steel production should strive to complete the state plan of 1.65 million tons fifteen days ahead of schedule, and strive to reach an annual output of 1.8 million tons. During this period, production in all walks of life in the city rose rapidly, presenting a gratifying situation with a completely new atmosphere. In August, the city's total industrial output value increased by 13.9% compared to July. The output value of the seven industrial bureaus of metallurgy, machinery, electrical machinery, chemical industry, power industry, light industry, and textile industry all exceeded the monthly plan and all increased compared to July. The quality of most products has been further improved, and certain achievements have also been made in conservation. The situation in September is even better. In the first and middle ten-day periods, the city's total industrial output value increased by another 27.9% compared to August, with a larger leap forward. Among them, the middle ten-day period increased by 32.6% compared to the first ten-day period. During this period, there were also many new products, new records, and new technologies. Technological innovation and technological revolution have also developed, with increasingly rich content and more projects.

    The overall characteristic of the current production increase and thrift campaign is that it is both boisterous and down-to-earth. The Municipal Party Committee emphasized this issue from the beginning, fully utilizing the experience of letting go and mobilizing the masses and strengthening enterprise management since the Great Leap Forward last year. Therefore, in recent days, inside each industry and each factory, between factories, between workshops, between shifts, especially between groups, and between the same types of work and the same products, competitive activities have been very lively. Large-scale and small-scale evaluations, large-scale and small-scale exchanges, large-scale and small-scale visits, and large-scale and small-scale collaborations are carried out very enthusiastically. The specific characteristics of this feature are: the mass mobilization of the movement is broad, the enthusiasm is high, and the red flag competition is closely combined with opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigor; most factories grasp the work of groups, going all the way to the end, and implementing a series of activities such as setting targets, proposing measures, and tackling key problems through the groups, thus the goals are clear, the measures are specific, and the key production problems are solved quickly; the Municipal Party Committee, each district, each bureau, the company, and even the factory have their own key units, so the situation is grasped tightly and in detail, and problems are solved relatively quickly; the movement initially paid attention to implementing the comprehensive viewpoint of high production, high quality, conservation, and safety, so the leap forward is comprehensive and the movement is healthy.

    Judging from the current development of the city's production increase and thrift campaign, cadres have thoroughly criticized right-leaning thoughts, cadres and the masses are full of energy, targets are advanced, measures are specific, and technological revolution and labor competition are vigorously carried out. Such factories account for 40%-45%. Cadres and the masses have sufficient energy, and targets and tasks have also been arranged, and the masses have made guarantees, but some units still have some problems with raw materials. The measures are not specific enough, and the technological revolution has been launched but is not yet thorough enough. Such factories account for 48%-53%. There are also 7% or less of factories where the leadership lacks confidence, the targets have not yet been distributed to the masses, or have been told to the masses but have not been mobilized well, and their actions are slow.

    Recently, various district committees and industrial bureaus have been helping factories that have real difficulties in completing their plans to solve their difficulties, and helping factories with relatively poor work to carry out their work, so that they can quickly catch up, thus the proportion of advanced and backward factories is changing rapidly.

    Based on the comparison of the situation of factories that are doing relatively well and those that are doing relatively poorly during this period, the following issues are relatively important. The quality of mass mobilization is closely related to the quality of cadre thinking, and depends on whether cadres have full enthusiasm, strong demands, and tenacious will for "encouraging vigor, striving for upstream, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results." In units where cadres have conscientiously studied the central instructions and made profound criticisms of right-leaning slackening emotions, the masses are well mobilized. If cadres mobilize the masses with right-leaning slackening emotions, the mobilization is weak, and the masses cannot be mobilized either.

    How to combine being both boisterous and down-to-earth well depends on whether the cadres' work style is tight, ruthless, and detailed. Many examples show that where the key to production, technical measures, organizational work, and management systems are grasped tightly and meticulously, it is easy to combine being both boisterous and down-to-earth. Where the key is unclear and the measures are weak, the movement is neither boisterous nor down-to-earth. An important feature of Shanghai's current production increase and thrift campaign is that it has universally grasped the work of the most basic organizational unit of enterprise production – the group. Taking the Shanghai Motor Factory as an example, they started by strengthening the work of the groups to promote the in-depth development of the movement. Their specific approach is: on the one hand, they summarized the mass work experience of sixteen groups, widely exchanged and promoted it, and established advanced banners, then set off a climax of group competition in the same type of work and the same business. On the other hand, the leaders went deep into the groups, making the mass work of the groups more and more detailed, and promoting the movement to become more and more in-depth. The first step in their group work is to formulate advanced production targets and determine specific measures together with the masses through the methods of talking about the situation, handing over tasks, calculating details, raising directions, and making revolution, and to implement the targets and measures to each group and each worker, making them the masses' own goals. After that, they strive to mobilize the positive factors of everyone in the group to ensure the rapid realization of the targets and measures. And doing this well is based on the Party group as the core, uniting and relying on veteran workers, and doing a thorough and meticulous job of understanding and caring for people. The leaders also personally went to the production front line – the group – to specifically organize the masses to overcome some important weak links. They also organized cadres and technicians to go deep into the groups to work with the workers, using the method of carrying out mass movements to rectify process work. They also promoted the method of economic indicators going down to the shifts and groups, strengthened the economic accounting of the shifts and groups, so that the comprehensive requirements of high production, high quality, and conservation were specifically grasped by the workers. This series of work has made the production of the Shanghai Motor Factory a very gratifying situation.

    Vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution is an important means to achieve production increase and thrift. And to mobilize the technological revolution well is also closely related to thoroughly and meticulously organizing the masses to discuss plans. The more specific the plans are discussed, the clearer the masses' goals are, and the faster the technological revolution will be carried out. In many factories, the process of groups discussing plans has invisibly become a process for the masses to propose innovation suggestions. Some factories organize the masses to discuss plans on the one hand, and organize forces to focus on breaking through some weak links on the other hand, which can further encourage the masses' enthusiasm for vigorously engaging in technological revolution.

    Strengthening communist cooperation between factories, between shifts, between types of work, and between workers also plays a great role in overcoming difficulties and promoting production increase and thrift. The three steelmaking groups on the No. 1 furnace seat of the first converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant are well united with each other for the common honor of this furnace seat. When handing over shifts, the previous shift not only cleans up the slag, but even loads the molten iron, and explains the situation of the furnace to the next shift in detail, so that the next shift can start production relatively normally as soon as they come up. When taking over shifts, the next shift is not fussy, but also actively helps the previous shift to clear the slag. Precisely because of the good cooperation, the workers of this furnace seat are not better in technology than other furnace seats, and everyone's equipment is the same, but the achievements in output, quality, furnace age, and alloy consumption are relatively advanced in the entire workshop. Recently, the various district committees and industrial bureaus in the city have been vigorously organizing cooperation between factories, mutually supporting and cooperating in technology, labor, raw materials, and equipment, which has played a great role in overcoming the difficulties in completing the plan. This mass cooperation is actually a mass comprehensive balance, which can make up for the shortcomings of the comprehensive balance work of the leading departments.

### 既轰轰烈烈　又踏踏实实  上海增产节约运动深入发展

    既轰轰烈烈　又踏踏实实
    上海增产节约运动深入发展
    本报上海26日电　本报记者评述：当前上海工业战线上的增产节约运动，总的形势很好，高潮正在迅速向上推进，发展健康，并且已经取得不少经验。
    党的“反右倾、鼓干劲、厉行增产节约”的号召，是这一运动的巨大的政治动力。两个月来，全市各行各业的干部和工人，真是意气风发，绝大部分工厂都召开了群众大会，发动群众订出了提前和超额完成国家计划的保证和措施，生产指标普遍加码。今年全市工业总产值的年度指标，根据中央下达的任务计算，是比去年增长34％；最近，中共上海市委和上海市人民委员会，分析了当前的形势和各种有利条件，提出力争达到或超过增长40％。钢，要争取提前十五天完成年产一百六十五万吨的国家计划，并力争达到年产一百八十万吨。这一时期，全市各行各业生产迅速上升，出现了气象一新的可喜局面。8月份，全市工业总产值比7月份提高13.9％；冶金、机械、电机、化工、电业、轻工、纺织七个工业局的产值，全部超额完成月度计划，全部比7月份上升；大部分产品的质量又有进一步提高，节约也取得了一定的成绩。9月份的形势更好，上、中两旬全市工业总产值又比8月份增长了27.9％，跃进的幅度更大。其中，中旬又比上旬增加32.6％。这一时期，新产品、新纪录、新技术也特别多；技术革新和技术革命也有发展，内容日益丰富，项目增多。
    当前增产节约运动总的特色，是既轰轰烈烈而又踏踏实实。市委一开始就很强调这个问题，充分运用了去年大跃进以来放手发动群众和加强企业管理的经验。所以这些日子来，在各个行业和各个工厂的内部，厂与厂、车间与车间、班与班之间，特别是小组与小组、同工种和同产品之间，对口竞赛搞得十分热闹。大评比小评比、大交流小交流、大参观小参观、大协作小协作，进行得很热烈。这一特色的具体特征是：运动的群众发动面很广，劲头大，红旗竞赛和反右倾、鼓干劲紧紧的结合在一起了；大部分工厂都抓小组、抓到底，把订指标、提措施、攻关键等一系列活动，都通过小组一竿子到底，因而目标明确，措施具体，生产关键解决得快；市委、各区、各局、公司直到工厂，都有各自的重点单位，因而情况抓得较紧较细，解决问题比较及时；运动一开始就注意了贯彻高产、优质、节约、安全的全面观点，因而跃进全面，运动健康。
    就目前全市增产节约运动发展的情况来看，干部中批判右倾思想深透，干部和群众的干劲十足，指标先进，措施具体，技术革命和劳动竞赛蓬勃开展，这类工厂占40％—45％。干部和群众干劲很足，指标和任务也作了安排，群众提了保证，但部分单位的原材料还有些问题，措施不够具体、技术革命已开展但还不够深入，这类工厂占48％—53％。还有7％以下的工厂领导信心不足，指标尚未摊给群众，或已告诉群众但发动得很差，行动迟缓。
    最近期间，各个区委和工业局纷纷帮助完成计划确有困难的工厂解决困难，帮助工作比较差的工厂开展工作，使它们迅速跟上来，因而使先进和落后的比例变化很快。
    根据这一时期搞得比较好和比较差的工厂的情况对比起来看，如下几个问题是比较重要的。群众发动得好坏，与干部思想解决得好坏有很大关系，决定于干部对“鼓干劲、争上游、达到多快好省”是否有满腔的热情、强烈的要求、顽强的意志。凡是在干部中认真学习了中央指示，对右倾松劲情绪作了深刻批判的单位，群众都发动得很好。干部如果带着右倾松劲情绪去发动群众，动员无力，群众也发动不起来。
    如何把轰轰烈烈和踏踏实实结合得好，关键也在于干部的作风是否抓得紧、狠、细。很多事例说明，凡是对生产关键、技术措施、组织工作和管理制度抓得紧抓得细的，轰轰烈烈和踏踏实实很容易就结合起来了。凡是关键不明、措施无力的，运动既不轰轰烈烈，也不踏踏实实。这次上海的增产节约运动抓得深的一个重要特点，是普遍的抓了企业生产最基层的组织——小组的工作。以上海电机厂为例，他们就是从加强小组工作着手，来推动运动深入发展的。他们具体的作法是：一方面总结了十六个小组的群众工作经验，广泛进行了交流推广，树立了先进旗帜，然后掀起同工种、同业务的小组竞赛高潮。另一方面，领导又深入小组，使小组的群众工作愈做愈细致，促使运动愈来愈深入。他们抓小组工作的第一步，是通过谈形势、交任务、算细账、提方向、闹革命的方法，同群众一起制订先进的生产指标，确定具体的措施，把指标和措施落实到每个小组、每个工人，成为群众自己的奋斗目标。之后，便努力调动小组内每个人的积极因素，以确保指标和措施的迅速实现。而做好这一点又是以党的小组为核心，团结和依靠老工人，深入细致地做好了解人、关心人的工作。领导还亲临生产前线——小组，具体地组织群众攻克一些重要的薄弱环节。他们又组织了干部和技术人员，深入到小组中去同工人一起，用大搞群众运动的方法，整顿工艺工作。他们还推行经济指标下班组的办法，加强班组经济核算，使高产、优质、节约的全面要求为工人所具体掌握。这一系列工作，使上海电机厂的生产出现了十分可喜的局面。
    大闹技术革新和技术革命，是达到增产节约的重要手段。而要把技术革命发动得好，又与深入细致地组织群众讨论计划有很大关系。计划讨论得越具体，群众的奋斗目标越明确，技术革命开展得也越快。在很多工厂中，小组讨论计划的过程，就无形中变成群众提革新建议的过程。有些厂一面组织群众讨论计划，一面就组织力量重点突破一些薄弱环节，更能鼓舞群众大闹技术革命的热情。
    加强厂与厂、班与班、工种与工种、工人与工人之间的共产主义协作，对克服困难、促进增产节约的作用也很大。上海第三钢铁厂第一转炉车间一号炉座上的三个炼钢小组，为了本炉座的共同荣誉，互相团结得很好。交接班的时候，上一班不但把渣子清好，甚至铁水也装好，把炉子的情况也详细地交代给下一班，使下一班一上来就能比较正常的生产。下一班在接班的时候，也不斤斤计较，还主动帮助上一班清渣。正因为协作得好，这个炉座的工人技术并不比别的炉座好，设备大家也一样，而产量、质量、炉龄和合金消耗等方面的成绩，却是全车间比较先进的。最近期间，全市各个区委和工业局都在大力组织厂际之间的协作，在技术上、劳动上、原材料上、设备上互相支援协作，对克服完成计划中的困难起了很大的作用。这种群众性的协作，实际上是群众性的综合平衡，可以弥补领导部门综合平衡工作的不足。
