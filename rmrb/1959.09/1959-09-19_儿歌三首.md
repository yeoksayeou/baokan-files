Three Children's Songs
Wang Wenbing
  Harvest golden mountains, silver mountains, everywhere grain is piled up like mountains; mountains link to mountains, mountains lean on mountains, mountains stack upon mountains, mountains surround mountains; in the past, going to school was a straight road, now going out the door is all turns...

  Fishing, big boats sail, small boats rock, big boats and small boats float on the water; uncles catch, aunties scoop, one net of fish and shrimp is one net of treasure; fish and shrimp jump and leap, everyone laughs heartily, the boats' holds are piled high, Dad's back is bent from rowing the boat!

  Little bricklayer finishes reading, leaves school, older sister is busy building walls; build a square courtyard for the chickens, build a small building for the pigeons! I call her sister, she ignores me, she insists I call her little bricklayer.

    儿歌三首
    王文丙
  丰收金山山，银山山，处处粮食堆成山；山连山，山靠山，山叠山来山绕山；过去上学走直路，如今出门尽拐弯
    ……。
  捕鱼大船开，小船摇，大船小船水上飘；叔叔捕，阿姨捞，一网鱼虾一网宝；鱼虾蹦蹦跳，大家哈哈笑，船船仓仓堆的高，爸爸撑船累弯腰！
    小瓦匠读完书，下学堂，姐姐忙着去砌墙；给鸡砌个平方院，给鸽盖间小楼房！我喊她姐姐她不理，非叫我喊她小瓦匠。
