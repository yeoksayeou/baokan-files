Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 24th. The workers of Shanghai's Jiangnan Shipyard, with amazing speed, completed the hull construction of another 5,000-ton freighter, the "Peace 58," in just thirty-five days, halving the dockyard cycle of the "Peace 28," a ship of the same tonnage built during the Great Leap Forward last year. The new ship was launched yesterday, a precious gift from all the factory workers to celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The halving of the dockyard cycle for the 5,000-ton freighter is entirely the result of the Jiangnan Shipyard workers' persistent implementation of the General Line, comprehensive execution of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and continuous leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. It is also a victory of opposing right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

When the first 5,000-ton freighter was built last year, the initial planned dockyard cycle was nine months. After continuously opposing right-leaning conservatism, vigorously launching mass movements, and engaging in technical revolution, it was finally launched in seventy days, exceeding the speed of Japanese construction of ships of the same tonnage.

In the first half of this year, Jiangnan Shipyard workers also completed two 5,100-ton train ferries in twenty-nine and twenty days, respectively, accumulating more experience in high-speed shipbuilding. As a result, the workers were even more motivated and eager, and eagerly hoped for the commencement of the second 5,000-ton freighter. However, due to insufficient material supply and incomplete blueprints, some cadres lacked sufficient confidence in the commencement of the new freighter, and some cadres had a one-sided understanding of "high quality and high yield." Seeing "high quality," they did not dare to propose leap forward targets, and did not dare to consider shortening the dockyard cycle again.

In early August, the People's Daily editorial "Overcome Right-Leaning Emotions and Vigorously Increase Production and Practice Economy" quickly aroused a strong response in the Jiangnan Shipyard. The Party committee mobilized all the factory workers to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, launching a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy. The right-leaning and fearful emotions of individual cadres were swept away. If materials were lacking, they actively transferred them from other places, and at the same time, the factory allocated eighty tons of steel ingots to the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant to be processed into welding rods. If the blueprints were not complete, the layout workshop urged them while working on whatever they had. Layout work could cause serious accidents, waste steel, and affect shipbuilding speed due to "a line difference or a word error." Workers absorbed past experiences and initially formulated nine rules and regulations, with everyone responsible for self-inspection and mutual inspection. As a result, seventy-three tons of steel were saved, and more than one hundred accidents were avoided successively.

An upsurge of leap forward emerged in the factory, wave upon wave, and the workers in the shipbuilding workshop proposed a leap forward plan for a forty-day dockyard cycle. The Yan Chenghui group, which participated in the construction of the 5,000-ton freighter last year, was even more energetic this year. The Xu Jinxiang group, which had no experience in building large freighters in the past, was also "a newborn calf not afraid of tigers," and proposed more advanced indicators than the Yan Chenghui group. Each group issued war pledges to each other, promoted each other, and motors and hammers rang together on the dock, and electric welders and air cutting machines sparked and flew. Some workers stayed overnight on the dock, and some workers fought hard in the water. Faster speeds were finally created: The "Peace 58" freighter was launched five days ahead of the leap forward plan.

In the construction of the "Peace 58" freighter, because of the experience gained last year and in the first half of this year, the vigorous mass movement and the down-to-earth leadership style were better combined, and the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical were fully met. The new freighter not only had a fast dockyard cycle, but also had a displacement of 690 tons more than last year's "Peace 28," reaching 9,420 tons. Sixteen tons of steel were saved compared to the first ship, and 33,000 man-hours were also saved, reducing costs by 4.48%. The welding quality of the entire ship was inspected by X-ray on the main structures, and the pass rate reached 99.2%.

After the new ship was launched, the outfitting workers have proposed to complete all construction, delivery, and acceptance in fifty-nine days, striving to shorten the time from launching to delivery by twenty days compared to last year's "Peace 28." (Attached picture)

### 江南造船厂又赢得高速度  三十五天完成一艘五千吨海轮船体工程

    江南造船厂又赢得高速度
    三十五天完成一艘五千吨海轮船体工程
    新华社上海24日电　上海江南造船厂职工以三十五天的飞快速度，完成了又一艘载货五千吨的海轮“和平五十八号”的船体工程，比去年大跃进中制造的同样吨位的“和平二十八号”的船台周期，又缩短了一半。新轮已在昨天下水，这是全厂职工向伟大的建国十周年献上的一份珍贵礼物。
    五千吨海轮的船台周期又缩短一半，完全是江南厂职工坚持贯彻总路线、全面贯彻多快好省，在去年大跃进基础上继续跃进的结果，也是在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，反右倾、鼓干劲的胜利。
    去年制造第一艘五千吨海轮时，船台周期最初计划九个月；经过不断反对右倾保守，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，最后以七十天的船台周期下水，超过了日本建造同样吨位海轮的速度。
    今年上半年，江南厂职工又先后以二十九天和二十天的船台周期，建成了两艘排水量五千一百吨的火车轮渡，积累了更多的高速度造船的经验。因此，工人们斗志更旺，干劲更足，迫切希望第二艘载货五千吨的海轮开工。但是由于材料供应不足，图纸还未全部完成，有些干部对新海轮的开工缺乏足够的信心，也有些干部对“高产优质”有片面的理解，看到
  “优质”，就不敢提跃进指标，不敢再考虑缩短船台周期了。
    8月初，人民日报“克服右倾情绪，厉行增产节约”的社论在江南厂迅速引起强烈的反响。党委动员全厂职工反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起增产节约新高潮，个别干部中的右倾畏难情绪一扫而光。缺材料，积极向外地调，同时从本厂拨出八十吨钢锭，到上钢三厂加工成电焊条；图纸没有全，放样工段就一边催，一边有一张干一张。放样工作可能由于“一线之差，一字之误”，造成严重事故，浪费钢材，影响造船速度。工人们吸收了过去的经验，一开始就订出九个规章制度，人人负责，自检互检，结果，节约了七十三吨钢材，先后避免了一百多个事故。
    厂里出现了一浪推一浪的跃进形势，造船车间工人提出了四十天船台周期的跃进计划。去年参加过造五千吨海轮的严成辉小组，今年劲头更大；过去没有造大海轮经验的徐金祥小组，也是“初生之犊不怕虎”，提出了比严成辉小组更先进的指标。各小组互下战表，相互促进，船台上马达与铁锤齐鸣，电焊机和风割机火花飞舞，有的工人夜宿船台，有的工人涉水苦战。更快的速度终于创造出来了：“和平五十八号”海轮比跃进计划提前五天下水。
    在建造“和平五十八号”海轮中，因为有了去年和今年上半年的经验，使轰轰烈烈的群众运动和踏踏实实的领导作风更好地结合起来，全面达到了多快好省的要求。新海轮不但船台周期速度快，而且排水量比去年的“和平二十八号”增加六百九十吨，达到九千四百二十吨，钢材比第一艘节约十六吨，工时也节约三万三千个，成本降低4.48％。全船的焊接质量，在主要结构上经过X光检验，合格率达到99.2％。
    新船下水后，舣装工人已提出用五十九天时间全部建成交货验收，争取比去年“和平二十八号”从下水到交货时间再缩短二十天。（附图片）
