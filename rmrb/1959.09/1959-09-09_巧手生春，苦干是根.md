Skillful Hands Bring Spring, Hard Work is the Root
Sun Ping
    The Chen Junde mutual aid group of the Geological Exploration Instrument Factory of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry is an outstanding advanced collective that emerged in this year's Red Flag competition in Shaanxi Province. They completed two years' worth of work in half a year, becoming a model for everyone to "learn" and "catch up with." The reason is that they use their brains in everything, innovate every month, and continuously improve 52 tools, working well and "skillfully." The Dayu Quartz Mine in Chang'an County, known for "advancing despite difficulties," originally planned for 300 people to mine for 330 days to complete the task of 50,000 tons of quartz. After a series of technological innovations, only 50 people were used, and in four months, they completed 42,000 tons. This all illustrates the power of "skill." The workers said, "Skillful work, skillful work, leap forward achieved," "Without skill, it's hard to leap forward," which is very reasonable. Now, the Party calls on us to boost our energy, oppose right-leaning tendencies, and complete the main production targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This word "skill" is even more important. Achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is based on "exerting full effort and striving for the upstream." There must be "skill" within "effort," and we must also pay attention to "skill" in "striving," because simply relying on physical strength and blindly working hard will not achieve great things. This is the fundamental reason why we repeatedly emphasize the need to vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution, and advocate implementing "skillful work" on the basis of "hard work," doing the most with the least manpower and the least time.
    Is there a "trick" to "skill"? Yes. If there were no "trick," why are some people "skillful" while others are "clumsy"? But this "trick" is not some "one-point breakthrough" magic trick, but "hard work." In fact, even magic tricks that are inexplicably amazing and performed cleanly require a lot of hard work.
    People praise Mei Lanfang for performing "perfectly." What is the "trick" to being "perfect"? From his book "Forty Years of Stage Life," we can see that it is nothing more than the four words "diligent study and hard practice." People call Gai Jiaotian "Living Wu Song." How can he perform "living"? The fact that he still insists on practicing every day even after passing the age of "seventy" is the best answer.
    "Practice makes perfect," and "perfection comes from hardship." In the movement to increase production and practice economy, if everyone studies hard, practices hard, delves hard, and works hard, and if this is done in everything and at all times, "success will come naturally." We will definitely become more "skilled" day by day, more "skillful" day by day, and do better day by day.
    At present, on all fronts, everyone is full of vigor and high spirits, sweeping away the right-leaning and lax atmosphere, determined to work hard and create even more brilliant achievements to present as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, which is really good. I believe that this requires starting with "hard work" in a down-to-earth manner.

    巧手生春，苦干是根
    孙平
    石油工业部地质勘探仪器厂陈俊德互助组，是今年陕西省红旗竞赛中涌现出来的一个出色的先进集体，他们以半年的时间干完了两年的工作量，成为人人
  “学”和“赶”的榜样，其原因就是他们事事动脑筋，月月有革新，连续改进了五十二件工具，干得好又干得“巧”。以“知难而进”而驰名的长安县大峪石英矿，原计划三百人开采三百三十天才能完成五万吨石英的任务，经过一系列的技术革新以后，只用了五十人，开采了四个月，就完成了四万二千吨。都说明了“巧”的威力。工人同志们说：“巧干巧干，跃进实现”，“无巧难跃进”，说得很有道理。如今，党号召我们鼓干劲，反右倾，提前完成第二个五年计划的主要生产指标，这“巧”字就更加重要。多快好省，建立在“鼓足干劲，力争上游”的基础上，“干”的里边要有“巧”，“争”的里边也要讲究“巧”，因为光拼体力、光蛮干，是干不出大名堂来的。这就是我们为什么一再强调要大闹技术革新和技术革命，提倡在“苦干”的基础上实行“巧干”，用最少的人力、最少的时间干最多的事的根本原因所在。
    “巧”有“窍诀”么？有。没有“窍诀”，为什么有的人“巧”而有的人“拙”呢？但这个“窍诀”，不是什么“一点即破”的变戏法、玩魔术的“窍诀”，而是“苦干”。其实，变戏法变得令人莫名其妙，玩魔术玩得干净利落，也是非下一番苦功夫不可的。
    人都夸梅兰芳把戏演“绝”了，“绝”的“窍诀”是什么？从他写的“舞台生活四十年”里，可以看出，不外“勤学苦练”四个大字。人称盖叫天为“活武松”，怎么能演“活”？已过“古稀”之年，还是天天坚持练功的事实，是最好的答复。
    “熟能生巧”，“熟从苦来”。在增产节约运动中，苦学、苦练、苦钻、苦干，人人如此，事事如此，时时如此，“功到自然成”，就一定会一天比一天干得“熟”，一天比一天干得“巧”，一天比一天干得“好”的。
    眼前，在各个战线上，人人意气风发，精神振奋，一扫右倾松劲之气，要大干特干一番，创造更加辉煌的成绩，向国庆十周年献礼，实在是好。我以为，这就需要踏踏实实地从“苦干”着手不可。
