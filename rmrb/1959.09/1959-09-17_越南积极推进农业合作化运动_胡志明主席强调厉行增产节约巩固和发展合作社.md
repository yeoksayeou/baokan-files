Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, Electric Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in a speech at a recent summing-up meeting on the agricultural cooperativization movement, called on all levels and departments, from the central to the local, to conscientiously participate in the agricultural cooperativization movement. Departments such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and trade must all seriously promote the great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and do a good job in the cooperativization movement.

He said that the primary purpose of our running cooperatives is to improve the living standards of the peasants. To improve living standards, we must run the cooperatives well, and we must practice increased production and thrift. To achieve this, we must correctly follow the central government's guidelines and policies. We must do a good job in evaluating work points and calculating long-term mutual aid teams, and then develop these mutual aid teams into cooperatives.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh also said that in order to consolidate and develop cooperatives well, we must pay attention to the issue of production, and we must ensure that cooperatives and members not only increase their income in grain production, but also increase their income in other types of production. We must run cooperatives diligently and frugally, and oppose extravagance and waste.

The summing-up meeting on the agricultural cooperativization movement was held from September 7th to 13th. The purpose of this meeting was to focus on summarizing the achievements and existing problems of the cooperativization movement in North Vietnam since the great development of the cooperativization movement since last winter, and to propose the work guidelines for the end of 1959 and 1960.

At the closing meeting on the 13th, Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Labor Party Central Committee, made a summary report on behalf of the Presidium of the meeting. Truong Chinh pointed out that the situation reflected at the meeting fully proved that the current cooperativization movement in North Vietnam is fully in line with the requirements of the broad masses of peasants, and confirmed the conclusion once made by the Party Central Committee that the development of the movement is basically good and healthy.

Truong Chinh then gave a detailed explanation on the issues of the direction, policies, and policies of the future development of the cooperativization movement. He instructed all localities to grasp the Party Central Committee's policy, which is: "Actively lead, advance steadily, comprehensively plan, combine with local realities, and work well, steadily, and economically." He said that the work of development and consolidation go hand in hand. All localities must strive to implement the resolutions of the Sixteenth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee and strive to basically complete the agricultural cooperativization movement in 1960.

Truong Chinh said that although the current agricultural cooperativization movement has not yet reached its climax, it has truly formed a mass movement. He emphasized that it is necessary to continuously increase the yield per unit area of cooperatives, increase income, improve the lives of members, and continuously give play to the superiority of cooperatives on the basis of collective labor and continuous technological reform.

He also emphasized the importance of conducting political and ideological education for members and continuously improving their socialist awareness.

Truong Chinh finally requested all localities to regularly combine the increase production movement with the cooperativization movement, pay attention to leading the fertilization and management of autumn rice, and prepare for an unprecedented and comprehensive bumper harvest this winter and next spring.

    越南积极推进农业合作化运动
    胡志明主席强调厉行增产节约巩固和发展合作社
    据新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道，胡志明主席在最近召开的农业合作化运动总结会议上讲话时，号召从中央到地方，各级、各部门必须认真地参加农业合作化运动。农林、水利、贸易、宣传等部门，都必须认真推动农业合作化运动大大向前发展，并且搞好合作化运动。
    他说，我们办合作社的首要目的是为了提高农民的生活水平。要提高生活水平就必须把合作社办得好，就必须实行增产节约。要作到这样，必须正确遵循中央的方针政策。必须搞好评工计分的长年变工组，再把这些变工组发展为合作社。
    胡志明主席还说，要想很好地巩固和发展合作社，就必须注意生产问题，务必使合作社和社员不仅在谷物生产方面的收入增加，而且还在其他各种生产方面的收入都增加。必须勤俭办合作社，反对铺张浪费。
    农业合作化运动总结会议是在9月7日到13日举行的。这次会议的目的是着重总结自去年冬季以来越南北方合作化运动大发展这段期间合作化运动的成绩和存在的问题，并提出1959年年底和1960年的工作方针。
    在13日的闭幕会议上，劳动党中央政治局委员长征代表会议主席团作了总结报告。长征指出，从会议上反映的情况，充分证明了当前越南北方合作化运动完全符合广大农民群众的要求，确认了党中央曾经作过的结论，这就是：运动的发展基本上是好的、健康的。
    长征接着就今后合作化运动发展的路线、方针、政策等问题作了详细说明。他指示各地必须掌握党中央的方针，这个方针是：“积极领导，稳步前进，全面规划，结合地方实际情况，好、稳、省地进行工作。”他说，发展和巩固的工作并行。各地必须为实现党中央第十六次会议的决议而努力奋斗，争取在1960年基本完成农业合作化运动。
    长征说，当前的农业合作化运动，虽然还没有达到高潮时期，但它已真正形成群众运动。他强调必须在集体劳动和不断改革技术的基础上，不断提高合作社的单位面积产量，增加收入，改善社员生活，不断发挥合作社的优越性。
    他还强调了向社员进行政治、思想教育，不断提高他们的社会主义觉悟的重要性。
    长征最后要求各地经常地把增产运动同合作化运动结合起来，注意领导秋季水稻的施肥和管理工作，为争取今冬明春的空前的和全面的丰收作好准备。（附图片）
