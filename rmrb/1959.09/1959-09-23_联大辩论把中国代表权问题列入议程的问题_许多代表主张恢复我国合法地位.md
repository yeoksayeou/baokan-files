Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 22nd: TASS reports: The United Nations General Assembly began discussing the General Committee's report on the agenda of the Fourteenth Session on the 21st, including the "recommendation" passed by the General Committee under pressure from the U.S. delegation, which rejects India's suggestion to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the session's agenda.

    The first speaker in the debate was Nepal's representative, Saha. He said that the government of the People's Republic of China is the only government that exercises complete and effective control over Chinese territory, and therefore, only it can represent the country in the United Nations.

    He proposed an amendment to the U.S. proposal passed by the General Committee, recommending that the General Assembly agree to India's request to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the General Assembly's agenda.

    U.S. representative, Robertson, former Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, spoke and viciously slandered the People's Republic of China and its government. He used the most absurd lies to try to convince the General Assembly that the U.S. proposal must be adopted.

    Subsequently, many speaking representatives gave due rebuttal to the U.S. representative's speech.

    Pegiwak (Afghanistan) drew the representatives' attention to the fact that world public opinion is increasingly concerned about the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China, and that this issue should be discussed in the United Nations General Assembly. He said that the proposal put forward by the General Committee denies any member state of the United Nations the right to raise questions to the United Nations General Assembly, so Afghanistan cannot support this proposal. Pegiwak pointed out that if the Nepalese amendment is not adopted, he will vote against the U.S. proposal.

    Ghana's representative, Quaison-Sackey, said indignantly that the United Nations should not become "some kind of club of privileges, refusing countries that some countries do not like abroad." The Ghanaian representative said that it is absurd that every year someone prevents the United Nations from even discussing the issue of China's representation.

    Although Irish Foreign Minister Aiken's speech also contained prejudices against the Chinese People's Government, he pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly should be a place to discuss various important international issues. He said that no one can deny the importance of the issue of China's representation, and he stated that his delegation would vote in favor of the Nepalese amendment.

    At the afternoon session, Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuznetsov spoke first.

    The Soviet representative said that restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is an important and urgent task facing the Fourteenth United Nations General Assembly. The sooner this issue is resolved quickly and positively, the sooner the United Nations will have true universality.

    Kuznetsov pointed out that for ten years, representatives of some governments, primarily the United States, have stubbornly obstructed the resolution of this issue in violation of the United Nations Charter and the basic norms of international law.

    The Soviet representative exposed the clumsy attempts of some countries that recognize the People's Republic of China to justify their passive stance on the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, saying that discussing this issue is untimely.

    Kuznetsov said that it should be pointed out that, thanks to the efforts of countries and peoples, much has been done in the past year to ease tensions between countries and reduce the danger of war. The tendency to resolve disputes through negotiations in international relations has been strengthened. The "Cold War" ice is beginning to melt. In this regard, the mutual visits of Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and U.S. President Eisenhower are of great significance. Kuznetsov emphasized that in this situation, opposing the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations can only indicate an attempt to obstruct the development of the relaxation that has already emerged in international relations, to oppose the policy of consolidating peace, and to oppose the development of international cooperation.

    The Soviet representative then exposed the various conspiracies of the United States and certain other countries aimed at creating hostility towards the great Chinese people. He cited concrete facts to prove that the entire policy and all activities of the Chinese people and their government are aimed at striving to maintain a peaceful international environment, because this environment helps them complete their magnificent plans for economic and cultural construction.

    Speaking about the U.S. representative's speech, Kuznetsov said: This is not the first time we have seen the U.S. representative play the very undignified role of defending the Chiang Kai-shek elements here, who cannot represent anyone but their own shadows. Kuznetsov pointed out that Robertson's speech contained nothing more than deliberately distorting the facts and maliciously slandering the great Chinese people and their legitimate government.

    Kuznetsov said Robertson talked a lot about the use of force in the Taiwan Strait area, but as long as we recall such a conclusive truth: Taiwan and the coastal islands of China are inseparable parts of China, and they are occupied by force by foreign occupiers, the complete falsity of his statement is clear to every fair person.

    Kuznetsov said that Robertson's speech can only be regarded as an attempt by the U.S. delegation to once again make the General Assembly evade studying the issue we are debating, and to bring us back to the worst days of the "Cold War."

    He said that the Soviet delegation firmly supports the Indian delegation's suggestion to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the General Assembly's agenda, and calls for rejecting the proposal put forward by the U.S. representative in the General Committee. The Soviet delegation will vote in favor of the amendment proposed by the Nepalese delegation.

    The head of the Polish delegation, Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki, said that China is a large country, and no important international issues can be resolved without it. Today, the issue of China's representation is of greater importance than in the past, and the Polish delegation will vote in favor of the Nepalese amendment.

    Iraqi Foreign Minister Jawad said that changes in China's political and social system should not involve its international status. The United Nations should face reality, and the Iraqi delegation will vote in favor of the Nepalese amendment.

    Representatives from Romania, Indonesia, Czechoslovakia, the United Arab Republic, Albania, and Finland also favored including the issue of China's representation on the agenda of the Fourteenth United Nations General Assembly. Only the representatives from Thailand and the United Kingdom attempted to oppose including this issue on the agenda.

    联大辩论把中国代表权问题列入议程的问题
    许多代表主张恢复我国合法地位
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会21日开始讨论总务委员会关于第十四届会议议程的报告，其中包括总务委员会在美国代表团压力下所通过的“建议”，即拒绝印度提出的关于把中国在联合国的代表权问题列入会议议程的建议。
    尼泊尔代表萨哈在辩论中第一个发言。他说，中华人民共和国政府是对中国领土实现完全和有效控制的唯一政府，因此，只有它才能在联合国中代表这个国家。
    他对总务委员会所通过的美国提案提出修正案，其中建议大会同意印度的要求，把中国在联合国的代表权问题列入大会议程。
    美国代表、前美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊发言，大肆污蔑中华人民共和国及其政府。他利用最荒谬的谎言企图使大会相信必须通过美国的提案。
    随后，许多发言的代表对美国代表的发言给予了应有的反击。
    佩吉瓦克（阿富汗）提请代表们注意，世界公众日益关心中华人民共和国的代表权问题，这个问题应该在联合国大会上予以讨论。他说，总务委员会提出的提案否定了联合国任何一个会员国向联合国大会提出问题的权利，因此阿富汗不能支持这个提案。佩吉瓦克指出，如果尼泊尔的修正案得不到通过，他将投票反对美国的提案。
    加纳代表奎森—萨基愤慨地说，联合国不应当成为“某种特权的俱乐部，而把某些国家所不喜欢的国家拒绝在国外”。加纳代表说，每年都有人使联合国甚至无法讨论中国的代表权问题，这种情况是荒唐的。
    爱尔兰外交部长埃肯的发言中虽然也有对中国人民政府抱成见的地方，但是他指出，联合国大会应该是讨论各种重要国际问题的地方。他说，谁也不能否认中国代表权问题的重要性，他表示，他的代表团将投票赞成尼泊尔的修正案。
    在下午会议上，苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫首先发言。
    苏联代表说，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利是第十四届联合国大会所面临的重要而迫切的任务。愈快地、积极地解决这一问题，联合国就将愈快地具有真正的普遍性。
    库兹涅佐夫指出，十年以来，一些政府的代表，首先是美国的代表，违反联合国宪章和国际法的基本准则，顽固地阻挠这一问题的解决。
    苏联代表揭穿了一些承认中华人民共和国的国家的拙劣的企图，它们为自己在恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题上的消极立场辩解，说什么讨论这个问题是不适时的。
    库兹涅佐夫说，应该指出，由于各国和各国人民的努力，最近一年来，在缓和国与国之间的紧张局势和减少战争危险方面做了很多事情。在国际关系中，通过谈判来解决争端的趋向加强了。“冷战”的冰块开始融化。在这方面苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔的互相访问具有重大的意义。库兹涅佐夫着重指出，在这种形势下，反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利只能表明是企图阻挠在国际关系中已经出现的缓和的发展，反对巩固和平的方针，反对发展国际合作。
    苏联代表接着揭露美国和其他某些国家目的在于制造对伟大中国人民的敌视的种种阴谋。他列举具体事实证明，中国人民及其政府的整个政策和全部活动都是为了努力维护和平的国际环境，因为这种环境有助于他们完成经济建设和文化建设的宏伟计划。
    库兹涅佐夫在谈到美国代表的发言时说：我们在这里看到美国代表扮演蒋介石分子辩护人这个十分不体面的角色已经不是第一次了，蒋介石分子除了自己的影子之外，不能代表任何人。库兹涅佐夫指出，罗伯逊的发言除了蓄意歪曲事实和恶毒诬蔑伟大的中国人民和他们的合法政府以外，没有什么更多的内容。
    库兹涅佐夫说罗伯逊谈了很多关于在台湾海峡地区使用武力问题，但是，只要回忆这样一个确凿的真理：台湾和中国沿海岛屿是中国不可分割的部分，它们被外国占领者用武力所占据，他的说法的全部虚伪性对每一个公正的人说来就很清楚了。
    库兹涅佐夫说，罗伯逊的发言只能被认为是美国代表团企图再一次使联大规避研究我们所辩论的问题，使我们回到“冷战”的最坏日子。
    他说，苏联代表团坚决支持印度代表团关于把中国在联合国的代表权问题列入联大议程的建议，并且呼吁拒绝美国代表在总务委员会中提出的提案。苏联代表团将投票赞成尼泊尔代表团提出的修正案。
    波兰代表团团长、波兰外交部部长腊帕茨基说，中国是一个大国，没有它就不能解决任何重要的国际问题。今天，中国代表权问题比过去具有更大的重要性，波兰代表团将投票赞成尼泊尔的修正案。
    伊拉克外长贾瓦德说，中国政治制度和社会制度的改变不应牵连到它的国际地位。联合国应该正视现实，伊拉克代表团将投票赞成尼泊尔的修正案。
    赞成把中国代表权问题列入第十四届联合国大会议程的还有罗马尼亚、印度尼西亚、捷克斯洛伐克、阿拉伯联合共和国、阿尔巴尼亚和芬兰的代表。只有泰国和英国代表企图反对把这个问题列入议程。
