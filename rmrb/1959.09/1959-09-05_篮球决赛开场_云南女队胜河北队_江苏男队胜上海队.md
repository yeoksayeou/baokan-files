In the last half minute, the Yunnan team got the ball, and the center passed it to Wu Xiangci, who turned around, jumped from a distance, and shot with both hands, scoring two more points. At this time, the gong rang, and the Yunnan women's basketball team defeated the strong Hebei team with a one-point advantage.

    篮球决赛开场
    云南女队胜河北队  江苏男队胜上海队
    本报讯　昨天是第一届全国运动会篮球决赛第一天，男、女共二十四个球队都上场对垒。获得分区预赛冠军的河北女子队出乎意料地以一分之差（四十二比四十三）败给年轻的云南女子队。四川女子队一直处在劣势下，仍沉着奋战，经过激烈争夺，最后以六十七比五十八胜了广东女子队。实力强劲的上海男子队也以六十七比七十一输给江苏男子队。
    其他各场比赛结果：解放军男、女队分别以一百零七比五十八和七十比五十胜陕西男队和贵州女队；北京男、女队以九十七比六十三和六十一比三十五分别胜湖北男、女队；吉林男、女队以八十四比六十七和四十七比二十八分别胜黑龙江男队和山西女队；上海女队以七十八比五十胜江苏女队；河北男队以七十七比六十七胜辽宁男队；四川男队以九十八比五十七胜广东男队。
    在北海体育场举行的河北对云南的女子篮球赛，打得扣人心弦。河北队去年才晋升为甲级篮球队，拥有三名国手。预赛时，是呼和浩特竞赛区的冠军。云南队是新军突起，实力相当雄厚，预赛时，曾击败江苏队而夺得长沙竞赛区的亚军。比赛开始后，河北队积极勇猛进攻，身高一点七八米的雍容和国手李玉珍双管齐下，使云南队很难招架。上半场结束时，比数是二十四比十八，河北队领先。下半场，云南队改变战术，实行快速进攻，并加强了防守，前锋邬湘慈，远距离双手投篮连连得分，到最后半分钟时追成四十一比四十二，只输一分。就在最后半分钟内，云南队得球，中锋长传给邬湘慈，她反身远距离跳起双手投篮，又得两分，这时场上铜锣敲响，云南女子篮球队以一分的优势打败了实力雄厚的河北队。
