New Development of Traditional Friendship between China and Afghanistan
    Zhou Yiliang
    Afghanistan is our western neighbor, with nearly one hundred kilometers of border adjoining our country. For two thousand years, the Chinese and Afghan people have maintained a profound friendship, but this close relationship was artificially severed only after the arrival of Western colonialists. However, in the struggle against the imperialists, the Chinese and Afghan people stood together. When the Opium War broke out and the Chinese people heroically resisted the British invaders on the eastern side of Asia, the Afghan people were also heroically resisting the invasion of British troops in Central Asia. After more than a hundred years of continuous struggle, Afghanistan achieved independence, and the Chinese revolution also achieved victory. Since then, the traditional friendship between China and Afghanistan has undergone new and further development. Now, as we warmly welcome Afghan Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim to visit China, it is very meaningful to look back at the traditional friendship between the two peoples and its development.
    As early as two thousand years ago, the Great Yuezhi people, who established a state in the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union and northern Afghanistan, already had contact with the Han Dynasty. At the end of the second century BC, the great Chinese traveler Zhang Qian visited the Great Yuezhi. Many of the crop varieties he brought back, such as sesame, grapes, carrots, and broad beans, are still the main agricultural products of Afghanistan today and have also become common foods in the daily life of the Chinese people. In 2 BC, the King of the Great Yuezhi sent an envoy, Yicun, to China. This envoy orally transmitted Buddhist scriptures to the Han court, and thus the Chinese first came into contact with Buddhist classics. It can be seen that Afghanistan had already begun cultural exchanges with China very early on. After the second century AD, many Yuezhi monks came to China, and they translated many important Buddhist scriptures, thereby enriching the treasure of Chinese Buddhist culture.
    Afghanistan is strategically located and is a vital hub for economic and cultural exchange between East and West, and for communication between China and India. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the Sui and Tang Dynasties, some monks who went to India or came east from India often passed through Afghanistan. The Baktria (缚喝国, i.e., Balkh) and Bamiyan (梵衍那) visited by Xuanzang on his westward journey were both within the territory of Afghanistan. Xuanzang described the large Buddha in Bamiyan, northwest of Kabul, saying: "It is one hundred and forty or fifty feet high, golden and dazzling, and adorned with precious ornaments." He also said that there was a "standing statue of Shakyamuni Buddha, more than one hundred feet high," made separately and then "assembled and erected." The great Buddha of Afghanistan is a great work of Buddhist art from the fifth century, and it still stands majestically today. However, the earliest written records and descriptions of the great Buddha statue are probably found in Xuanzang's travelogue. At that time, the Tocharian states within Afghanistan repeatedly sent envoys to visit the Tang Dynasty and maintained close contact with China.
    In the eleventh century AD, Sultan Mahmud, a famous figure in Afghan history, established the independent Ghaznavid Dynasty. In 1024, Emperor Shengzong of the Liao Dynasty and the Qocho Uyghur Qaghan of Gaochang jointly sent envoys with gifts and arrows as a sign of friendship to Afghanistan. Emperor Shengzong praised Mahmud in his letter as "valiant and outstanding, with effective governance. The country is peaceful, and the frontier towns are in awe." The letter from the Uyghur Ilig Qaghan to Mahmud also said: "The Sultan's bravery is well known in the East and West. He is also close to the benevolent and kind neighbors. I sincerely wish to be friends with the Sultan. Therefore, I am sending an envoy. Although the journey is long, our hearts are close." To a considerable extent, these rulers' words reflected the desire of the peoples of western and northern China to have friendly relations with the Afghan people. Although the Southern Song Dynasty did not have direct contact with Afghanistan at that time, Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" and Zhao Rukuo's "Zhu Fan Zhi" both listed the Ghaznavid Dynasty among the Arab countries. Zhao Rukuo also recorded that the King of Ghazni could draw a strong bow of several stones (a unit of weight) and use an iron hammer weighing more than fifty catties on horseback, "feared by the Arab and Western Heaven countries." It can be seen that Afghanistan at that time was not unfamiliar to the people of southern China.
    In the mid-eighteenth century, the Tajik people of Badakhshan region in northeastern Afghanistan established contact with the Qing Dynasty. In 1760, they sent envoys to Beijing, presenting Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty with knives, axes, and eight horses. The tribes of Bolor, east of Badakhshan, also sent envoys to China, sending swords, axes, and other items in 1762. In 1764, because the commander of Yarkand in China mediated the dispute between Badakhshan and Bolor, the chief of Bolor gave the Qing government "a treasured dagger" to express his gratitude. In 1769, they sent a pair of jade-handled daggers. Later, Badakhshan and Bolor were unified under Afghanistan, which Chinese history books at that time called Ai'ouhan (爱乌罕). The King of Ai'ouhan presented the Qing government with four fine horses, seven feet high and eight feet long, in 1762. From these examples, one can imagine the closeness of the friendly exchanges between China and Afghanistan during the Qing Dynasty.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new chapter has unfolded in the friendly relations between China and Afghanistan. Afghanistan recognized our country in January 1950, and the two countries officially established diplomatic relations in January 1955. In January 1957, Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to visit Afghanistan. In his speech welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister Daud traced the long-standing close trade and cultural relations between Afghanistan and China and mentioned that the past contacts between the two peoples had never been damaged by disagreements or animosity. He solemnly declared that the Afghan government and people are willing to establish the most sincere friendly relations with the Chinese government and people on the basis of mutual respect and in the spirit of peace and cooperation. In October of the same year, Prime Minister Daud was invited to visit China and received a warm welcome and reception from the Chinese people. The mutual visits of the national leaders of China and Afghanistan greatly promoted and developed the traditional friendship between the two countries.
    The economic and cultural contacts between China and Afghanistan have been increasing in recent years. The two countries have exchanged cultural delegations and soccer teams. To celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, the China Song and Dance Troupe visited Afghanistan for performances in August last year. In 1956, our country participated in the Afghan Independence Day Industrial Exposition. In early 1957, the Afghan Government Trade and Industry Delegation paid a one-month visit to our country. In July of the same year, our two countries signed a trade and payment agreement. All these frequent contacts and exchanges will inevitably strengthen mutual understanding between the two peoples and help promote the further development of friendship between the two peoples.
    Now, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Naim has been invited by Premier Zhou Enlai to visit our country. Deputy Prime Minister Naim has always held a deep friendship for the Chinese people. His visit to China, despite the hardships of a long journey, will surely make a beneficial contribution to the continued enhancement of the friendship between the peoples of China and Afghanistan.

    中国和阿富汗传统友谊的新发展
    周一良
    阿富汗是我国西面的邻邦，有将近一百公里的国境和我国相接壤。两千年来，中国人民和阿富汗人民始终保持着深厚的友谊，只是由于西方殖民主义者东来以后，才人为地被割断了这种亲密的关系。但是，在反抗帝国主义者的斗争中，中国人民和阿富汗人民是站在一起的。当鸦片战争爆发，中国人民在亚洲的东边英勇抗击英国侵略者的时候，阿富汗人民也正在亚洲的中部英勇抵抗英国军队的侵略。经过了一百多年的不断斗争，阿富汗取得了独立，中国革命也获得了胜利。从此，中国和阿富汗的传统友谊又有了新的、更进一步的发展。现在，当我们热烈欢迎阿富汗副首相兼外交大臣纳伊姆来中国访问的时候，回顾一下两国人民的传统友谊和它的发展，是十分有意义的。
    远在两千年以前，在苏联中亚地方和阿富汗北部建国的大月支人已经和汉朝有了联系。公元前二世纪末，伟大的中国旅行家张骞曾经到过大月支。他所带回的许多农作物品种如胡麻、葡萄、胡萝卜、蚕豆等，直到今天都还是阿富汗所盛产的农作物，同时也成为中国人民日常生活中习见的食品。公元前二年，大月支王派使臣伊存到中国来，这位使臣对汉朝人口授佛经，于是中国人第一次接触到佛教经典。可见从很早的时候起，阿富汗就已和中国开始了文化的交流。公元二世纪以后，有不少月支高僧到中国来，他们翻译了很多重要的佛经，从而丰富了中国佛教文化的宝藏。
    阿富汗地处冲要，是东西方经济、文化交流、沟通中国印度间交通的要道。南北朝隋唐时期，一些到印度去的或由印度东来的和尚，往往都经过阿富汗。玄奘西行时经过的缚喝国（即巴尔克）和梵衍那（即巴米安）都在阿富汗境内。玄奘描写喀布尔西北梵衍那的大佛说：“高百四五十尺，金色晃耀，宝饰焕烂”。又说有“释迦佛立像，高百余尺”。全身分别制造，最后“总合成立”。阿富汗的大佛是五世纪佛教艺术的伟大作品，到今天还巍然存在。但是有关大佛像的最早文字记录和描写，恐怕要算玄奘的游记了。当时，阿富汗境内的吐火罗等国，都屡派使臣访问唐朝，和中国保持着密切的联系。
    公元十一世纪，阿富汗历史上有名的苏丹马合木建立了独立的吉慈尼王朝。辽圣宗和高昌的西州回纥可汗在1024年一起派遣使臣，携带礼物，并且以箭为信，到阿富汗要求通好。圣宗的信里称誉马合木“英武卓越，统制有方。国内安靖，藩镇慑服”。回纥伊立格可汗给马合木的信里也说：“苏丹英勇，昭著于东西。又复亲仁善邻，朕至愿与苏丹为友。故今遣使，踪迹虽远，心实相近”。这些统治者的话在相当程度上反映了中国西部北部各族人民要求和阿富汗人民友好往来的愿望。南宋当时虽和阿富汗没有直接往来，但周去非的“岭外代答”和赵汝适的“诸蕃志”里，都在大食诸国之下列有吉慈尼王朝。赵汝适并且记载说吉慈尼国王能开数石的强弓，能在马上使用五十余斤重的铁锤，“大食及西天诸国皆畏焉”。可见当时的阿富汗对于中国南部的人民也不是陌生的。
    公元十八世纪中叶，阿富汗东北部巴达克山地区的塔吉克人和清朝发生联系。他们于1760年派使臣到北京，赠送给清高宗刀、斧和八匹骏马。巴达克山东边博罗尔的部落也曾派使臣到中国来，1762年派人来赠送剑、斧等物。1764年因为中国叶尔羌的都统调解了巴达克山和博罗尔之间的纠纷，博罗尔酋长“以所宝匕首”赠给清朝政府，表示感谢。1769年又送来玉柄双匕首。以后巴达克山和博罗尔都统一于阿富汗，中国当时史书称它为爱乌罕。爱乌罕国王1762年赠送清政府高七尺长八尺的良马四匹。从这些事例，可以想见清朝时期中国和阿富汗之间友好往来的密切。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以后，中阿两国之间的友好关系展开了新的一页。1950年1月阿富汗承认我国，1955年1月两国正式建立外交关系。1957年1月，周恩来总理应邀到阿富汗访问。达乌德首相在欢迎周恩来总理的讲话中，追溯了阿富汗和中国长期以来密切的贸易和文化关系，并且提到在两国人民过去的接触当中，从来没有被分歧和恶感所损害。他郑重申明，阿富汗政府和人民愿意在互相尊重的基础上并且本着和平与合作的精神，同中国政府和人民建立最真诚的友好关系。同年10月，达乌德首相应邀访问了中国，受到中国人民的热烈欢迎和接待。中阿两国国家领导人的相互访问，大大促进和发展了中阿两国的传统友谊。
    中阿两国的经济和文化接触最近几年来日益增多。两国互派过文化代表团和足球队。为庆祝阿富汗王国四十周年，中国歌舞团于去年8月赴阿富汗进行了访问演出。1956年我国参加了阿富汗独立日工业博览会。1957年初，阿富汗政府贸易实业代表团在我国进行了一个月的参观访问。同年7月，我们两国签订了贸易和支付协定。这一切频繁的接触和交往，必然会加强两国人民之间的相互了解，有助于促进两国人民的友谊的进一步发展。
    现在，纳伊姆副首相兼外交大臣又应周恩来总理的邀请，前来我国访问。纳伊姆副首相一向对中国人民抱着深切的友谊。他这次不辞辛劳、远道来访中国，必将对继续增进中阿两国人民的友谊，作出有益的贡献。（附图片）
