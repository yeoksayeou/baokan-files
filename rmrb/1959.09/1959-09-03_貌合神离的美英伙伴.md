    The Discordant US-UK Partnership
    By our correspondent Pan Fei
    Eisenhower's visit to London has concluded. He did not hold a press conference. The two sides in the talks also did not issue a joint communiqué. Instead, Eisenhower and Macmillan gave a twenty-minute "fireside chat" on television on the evening of August 31st. This television broadcast was simultaneously broadcast in the United States and all Western European countries, but according to the "Times" report, there was one exception: France.
    During Eisenhower's visit, Britain did its best to promote the relationship between the United States and Britain, arguing that it has never been closer or more normal. The "fireside chat" raised this atmosphere to its highest point.
    Emphasizing the good relationship between the United States and Britain is not only needed by the British Conservative Party for both domestic (general election) and foreign affairs (the struggle with France and West Germany), but also by the United States. Eisenhower's primary purpose in touring Western Europe was to adjust the relationships within the North Atlantic Group and patch up the rifts between Western countries. In particular, when the US President's trip to Paris was still "uncertain," Eisenhower needed to demonstrate that US-UK relations were very normal, thereby stabilizing the United States' leadership position in the capitalist world.
    However, even if both sides are pursuing such a goal of "seeming unity," and even if the "fireside chat" had been carefully arranged in advance, it still cannot conceal the differences between the United States and Britain on many important issues. Macmillan said very frankly in the television broadcast: "I have never hidden from you that I have often requested a summit meeting." Eisenhower's response was: "I will never attend meetings that make people feel frustrated and disappointed. Therefore, we must obtain some assurance that good results can be obtained, that is, with this one exception, they cannot ask me to do things I am unwilling to do." It is quite clear that on this issue, Eisenhower did not stand on Macmillan's side, but on Adenauer's side. When Eisenhower visited Bonn, Western newspapers revealed that the US President and the West German Chancellor intended to replace or delay the East-West summit with another meeting of foreign ministers.
    In the television broadcast, Eisenhower particularly emphasized that Western countries must adopt "tough" countermeasures on the Berlin issue. This is undoubtedly directly opposed to the "flexibility in diplomatic strategy" that Britain has been advocating in recent times. And Macmillan's request, in front of tens of millions of television viewers, that the United States relax restrictions on British wool fabrics also greatly marred the "US-UK cooperation."
    It is believed that the US-UK talks also touched on the issue of economic assistance to so-called backward countries, as well as the issues of disarmament and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. In the public talks between Eisenhower and Macmillan, in addition to a general mention of the former issue, not a single word was mentioned about the latter issue. This has aroused various speculations in Western newspapers. Everyone knows that the opinions of the United States and Britain on the issue of disarmament are not entirely consistent.
    A noteworthy "trivial matter" is that Eisenhower held a grand banquet on the evening of the 1st, inviting important figures from the British government and opposition parties, but former British Prime Minister Eden excused himself due to illness. People remember that after the Suez War, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was launched, forcing Eden to resign immediately. This is enough to show that some scars in US-British relations are still very painful when touched.

    貌合神离的美英伙伴	本报记者　潘非
    艾森豪威尔在伦敦的访问已经结束。他没有举行记者招待会。会谈双方也没有发表公报。代替这些的，是艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦在8月31日晚间在电视上作了一次二十分钟的“炉边谈话”。这次电视在美国和所有的西欧国家同时转播，但根据“泰晤士报”报道，有一个国家例外：法国。
    在艾森豪威尔访问期间，英国竭力宣传美英之间的关系，没有比现在更紧密、更正常了。“炉边谈话”把这种气氛渲染到最高点。
    强调美英关系的良好，不仅是英国保守党在对内（大选）对外（同法国和西德的斗争）都有需要，而且也为美国所需要。艾森豪威尔出巡西欧的首要目的，就是要调整北大西洋集团内部的关系，糊补西方国家之间的裂痕。特别是，当美国总统巴黎之行还在“吉凶未卜”的时候，艾森豪威尔更需要表现美英关系十分正常，从而稳定美国在资本主义世界的领导地位。
    但是，即使双方都追求着这样一个“貌似团结”的目的，即使“炉边谈话”早已经过了精心布置，仍然不能掩盖美英之间在许多重大问题上的分歧。麦克米伦在电视广播中十分坦率地说：“我从未对你隐瞒过这一点：我经常要求召开一次首脑会议”。而艾森豪威尔的回答是：“我决不会参加使人们感到沮丧和失望的会议，因此，我们必须取得可以得到良好结果的某种保证，那就是，除了这唯一的例外以外，他们不能够要求我去做我所不愿意做的事情。”十分明显，在这一问题上，艾森豪威尔并没有站在麦克米伦一边，而是站在阿登纳一边。当艾森豪威尔访问波恩的时候，西方报纸就透露，美国总统和西德总理打算以另一次外长会议来代替或拖延东西方最高级会议。
    在电视广播中，艾森豪威尔特别强调西方国家必须在柏林问题上采取“强硬”的对策。这同英国在最近一个时期以来所标榜的“外交策略上的灵活性”，无疑是针锋相对的。而麦克米伦当着几千万个电视观众的面，要求美国放宽对英国毛织品的限制，也使“美英合作”大煞风景。
    人们相信，美英会谈中还谈到了对所谓落后国家的经济援助问题，以及裁军和停止核武器试验问题。在艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的公开谈话中，除了笼统地提到了前一个问题外，对后一问题只字未提。这在西方报纸上引起了种种猜测。大家知道，美英在裁军问题上的意见，并不是完全一致的。
    引人注意的一件“琐事”是：1日晚间艾森豪威尔举行了一次盛大的宴会，遍请英国的朝野要人，而英国前首相艾登却托辞有病缺席。人们记得，在苏伊士战争之后，“艾森豪威尔主义”出笼，逼得艾登立即辞职。这足以说明，英美关系上的一些伤疤，至今一经碰到，还是很痛的。
