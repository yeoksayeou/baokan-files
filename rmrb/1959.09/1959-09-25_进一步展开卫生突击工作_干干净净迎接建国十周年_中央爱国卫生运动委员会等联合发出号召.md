Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. The CCP Central Schistosomiasis Control Leading Group, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and the Ministry of Health jointly convened a telephone conference on the evening of the 23rd, attended by responsible personnel from the Party committees' schistosomiasis prevention leading groups, patriotic health campaign committees, and health departments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose right-leaning tendencies and boost morale, the conference made important arrangements for the health campaign before the National Day and preparations for launching a campaign to eliminate pests and diseases in the autumn and winter seasons.

At the conference, Xu Yunbei, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Schistosomiasis Control Leading Group and Vice Minister of Health, gave a comprehensive analysis of the current situation of the national pest and disease elimination campaign, the health campaign before National Day, and the work to eliminate pests and diseases in the autumn and winter seasons. Under the general guiding spirit of boosting morale, enhancing confidence, opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, and achieving a continued leap forward in this year's pest and disease elimination work, basic requirements were put forward for this year's pest and disease elimination work in various regions: In terms of pest elimination, all dead corners should be eliminated in large and medium-sized cities, and the number of "four-free" villages should be doubled in rural areas. Mosquitoes and flies must be resolutely prevented from overwintering in both urban and rural areas throughout the country; seriously deal with and control mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and further improve environmental sanitation; in terms of disease elimination, strengthen the prevention of autumn and winter infectious diseases, and strive to greatly reduce the incidence of various infectious diseases compared with the same period last year; in terms of prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases, it is required to eliminate 1 billion square meters of Oncomelania hupensis snails and treat 500,000 to 1,000,000 schistosomiasis patients and 50,000,000 hookworm patients in the autumn and winter seasons this year. In schistosomiasis-endemic areas, schistosomiasis prevention should be the focus to promote the prevention and treatment of other diseases. At the meeting, Xu Yunbei also called on all major and medium-sized cities and people's communes across the country to seize the next few days, further launch a health campaign, and greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation cleanly, healthily, and happily.

Xu Yunbei said that in order to do the above work well, all regions must first organize health work cadres and medical and health personnel at all levels to seriously study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, combine this with inspections of pest and disease elimination work, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and overcome the pessimistic and fearful emotions of some cadres who lack confidence in pest and disease elimination work. It is necessary to continue to organize medical and health personnel to support the "three autumns" work of autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing in rural areas. Secondly, it is necessary to closely integrate with production and serve production, conscientiously implement the working principle of combining blitzes with regular work, and move forward. To this end, we must continue to use a series of methods to mobilize the masses, such as inspection, evaluation, learning from advanced models, catching up with advanced models, launching mutual competitions, and strengthening health propaganda, so that the movement can develop rapidly. Experiences among the masses should be discovered at any time and systematically and deeply summarized. In addition, local leading organs should also check the grassroots health organizations, consolidate professional teams, and make preparations for medicines, equipment, and other supplies for the autumn and winter battles.

Representatives from Sichuan, Guangxi, Jilin, Henan, Gansu, Jiangsu, Beijing and other seven provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions spoke at the meeting successively, expressing their determination to do a good job in the health campaign before the National Day, to firmly grasp the autumn and winter pest and disease elimination battle, and to realize a great leap forward in pest and disease elimination work.
