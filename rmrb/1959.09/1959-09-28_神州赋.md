Ode to Divine Land
By Li Xianyao

Who? Once hunched over a war map, surrounded by frantically sweeping enemies, with empty grain sacks and dwindling ammunition, yet embracing the conviction of victory, chatting with the local villager who brought news as if nothing was amiss. The midnight candlelight reflected the premature gray hairs on his head.

It is our beloved Party, like a steadfast pine tree in a blizzard.

Who? Today, facing a complex and dazzling chessboard of socialist construction, still possesses a clear vision and makes calm, deliberate moves. The rising sun shines on a newly formed wrinkle on his brow.

It is our beloved Party, like a soaring eagle over the vast land.

With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, even on the treacherous Long March, Chiang Kai-shek and his imperialist advisors couldn't achieve their desired outcome. Chasing after the Red Army, they only managed to pick up a few pairs of worn-out straw sandals.

The Chinese people, riding on the steed of the Great Leap Forward, illuminated by the Party's General Line, those reactionaries who cursed us from behind, hoping we would fall off our horses, are sure to end up with bruised faces and swollen noses themselves.

The new China was born on the People's Liberation Army's warhorses, and the Party tightly wrapped her in its battle robe.

Chiang Kai-shek never dreamed that the presidential palace in Nanjing, with its paint still wet, would be topped with a red flag. The old Red Army soldiers, who had prepared to eat from marching pots for their entire lives, didn't expect it to happen so quickly. The "On Guerrilla Warfare," with its dog-eared corners, was replaced by the newly printed "Compilation of Urban Policies" on their bedside tables. In 1949, the Chinese people, who had endured slavery and exploitation for generations, finally seized the "knife handle" from the hands of the reactionary rulers.

Generous and sorrowful songs, tradition says China is full of them. The blood of martyrs, redder than the peach blossoms of Longhua, and the loyal bones of the fallen, harder than the stones of Yuhuatai, have bought us the days we now see as most ordinary.

Lovers on a date by the White Pagoda in Beihai Park, right on the stone bench where you are nestled, there was once a young couple, strangers to each other, who, to avoid the prying eyes of spies, accepted the most glorious task assigned by the Party. From then on, they never met again, dedicating their youth, like March peonies, to a common ideal.

Children playing on the lawn of Jinggang Mountain, right in front of the slope where you are catching butterflies, there was once a member of the children's corps who didn't panic even when a white army bayonet touched his nose. The Red Army intelligence was hidden in his bamboo horse. This "Red Little Devil" loved catching butterflies just like you, but he used his young life to share the revolutionary burden of his fathers and brothers.

Remember! The source of our happy lives today...

The new China is growing up in the cradle of socialism, and the Party is nurturing her day and night with its own efforts.

Even if the redbud trees are burned to ashes, steel must be refined. The bare-handed Chinese people have yearned for steel for an entire century. In 1958, small blast furnaces and small stir-fry furnaces, with their red flames and silver flowers, illuminated half of Asia, and the sun would never again set on the motherland's horizon.

By the Jian Lake in Shaoxing, the clanging of tin foil has turned into the roar of blowers, awakening the plum blossom deer in that ancient painting in the Hundred Herb Garden. On the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, there was only a horseshoe shop the year before last; this year, a huge iron and steel complex has risen from the ground. Herdsmen, who just put down their lassoes, have picked up steel drills and learned to tame the fiery steeds of steel.

Steel. Whales need spines, and eagles need wings. From Anshan to Shanghai, from the banks of the Jialing River to the foot of Shijingshan, we send clangorous good steel to shipyards and aircraft factories.

The era when even iron nails had to be imported is over. We use the steel refined with our own sweat to build rainbows and ferry ourselves to a paradise on earth!

People's communes have been established. Chairman Mao, who gets up the earliest, saw the red glow in the east at a glance and praised repeatedly: "People's communes are good!" Before the words had faded, the sun rose, radiating a myriad of rays, startling the bats into panicked flight. The "poor stick society" with only three donkey legs formed a people's commune and could afford tractors. Even the Kawa ethnic group, who had only just emerged from primitive communes yesterday, also began to experiment with people's communes.

The joy of five hundred million peasants has composed a magnificent movement for "People's communes are good!" In the past, the lonely old people who were always frowning, this New Year, in the homes for the elderly, also snatched firecrackers with the children. Women with red ink on their lips used their wages to buy their mothers-in-law their first holiday gifts.

The people's communes are incredibly powerful, even leading the Dragon King by the nose. This year, reservoirs and water networks have subdued the drought demon. Even in a drought, the fields do not dry up, and the girls of Fengyang no longer have to carry flower drums and flee in all directions. Children sing in nurseries!

The textbooks for elementary schools say that the three treasures of Jilin are no longer just ginseng, mink, and wula grass, but also have new three treasures: automobiles, dyes, and fertilizer. At the Leipzig International Fair, the Chinese products that the audience couldn't bear to put down, in addition to ancient silks and teas, also included precision instruments and new machine tools.

Since ancient times, sages have been lonely, but now Yao and Shun are everywhere. There is the Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road; there is Zhang Fulin's class on Mount Que'er. The little Liangshan slave who led the way for the Liberation Army has joined the Party; the old scholar who angrily scolded the traitors in the old National Assembly has also joined the vanguard of the proletariat.

One Xiang Xiuli turned into a phoenix and flew away in the fire; millions of Xiang Xiulis were born in the baptism of floods. Even the most ordinary citizen of the new China is ten million times more noble than a White House politician who accepts campaign funding from Rockefeller.

Workers in New York, with their hands in their pockets, stand in long lines that stretch as far as the eye can see, their legs aching, and they still haven't received unemployment benefits. In the labor bureaus of our big cities, the telephones ring like cicadas in summer, constantly. This newly built factory, that groundbreaking construction site, all come to apply for quick allocation of workers. We will never have too many hands to build socialism!

Before liberation, did you hear the cries of newsboys on the Bund in Shanghai? A family of unemployed factory workers jumped from the roof garden. Now, every holiday, entire families of workers sit in the "Great World" to listen to comedy, and today's life makes the "packaged workers" of yesterday cry with laughter.

Since 1958, how far has the motherland leaped! The enemy is shouting at the top of their lungs: "China has greatly regressed!" That's right, our progress is their regression in their eyes. We are getting further and further away from their cannibalistic capitalist society. Under the leadership of flag-bearer Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the new China are constantly moving towards the great communist ideal!

Since 1958, how brilliant have the motherland's achievements been! Right-leaning opportunists slammed the table and shouted: "This is a mess!" Even embroidery has its prickly moments. On the road of socialist revolution and construction, 650 million people are galloping forward, and what does it matter if a few horses stumble? Why make a fuss. Those who are afraid of falling can lie on the steel bed of conservatism and seek your good dreams!

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party blew the bugle call for continued leap forward. The red flag of the General Line is waving like fire in the green fields. The excellent riders of the Chinese nation are forging ahead on the 9.6 million square kilometers of land. Look, who is the thousand-mile horse!

    神州赋
    黎先耀
    谁？曾经俯身在作战地图上，身陷疯狂扫荡的强敌，粮袋已空，弹药将尽，仍抱着必胜的信念，与报信的老乡谈笑自若。午夜的烛光，映着他头上数根早熟的华发。
    是我们亲爱的党，像漫天风雪中，一棵挺立的青松。
    谁？今天面对着一盘社会主义建设大棋局，错综复杂，眼花撩乱，依然胸中成竹，举棋沉着。初升的朝阳，照着他额前一条新添的皱纹。
    是我们亲爱的党，像万里江山上，一只高飞的雄鹰。
    有了共产党和毛主席的领导，中国人民就是在长征的险道上，蒋介石和帝国主义顾问也没有打成如意算盘，追在红军背后，只拣了几双烂草鞋。
    中国人民骑在大跃进的骏马上，有了党的总路线的照耀，跟在屁股后面，咒诅我们摔下马来的一切反动派，最后跌得眼青鼻肿的准是他们自己。
    新中国诞生在人民解放军的战马上，党用征袍把她紧紧包裹。
    蒋介石做梦也没有料到啊！南京城内油漆未干的总统府，插上了红旗。准备一生都在行军锅里吃饭的老红军，也没有想到这样快啊，背包里磨破了书角的“论游击战术”，换成了床头新印的“城市政策汇编”。1949年，几辈子受尽奴役和宰割的中国人民，终于从反动统治者手里，夺过了“刀把子”。
    慷慨悲歌士，相传中华多。比龙华桃花更红的志士们的鲜血，比雨花台石更硬的先烈们的忠骨，换来了我们今天看来是最平常的日子。
    北海白塔上约会的情侣们，就在你俩依偎着的这条石凳上，曾经有一对不相识的青年男女，为了躲过特务的狗眼，在这里接受党交给的最光荣的任务；从此，他俩再也没有相见，为共同的理想，献出了三月牡丹一样的青春。
    井冈山草坪上游戏的孩子们，就在你们捉蝴蝶的山坡前，曾经有一个儿童团员，白军的刺刀碰着他的鼻尖，也没有心慌，红军的情报就塞在他跨下的竹马里。这个“红小鬼”和你们一样爱捉蝴蝶，但是他用自己幼小的生命，分担了父兄的革命重担。
  记住吧！我们今天幸福生活的来源……。
    新中国在社会主义的摇篮里成长，党用自己的心血把她日夜哺育。
    烧尽红豆树，也要把钢炼成。赤手空拳的中国人民，对钢铁的相思啊，已经怀了整整一个多世纪。1958年，小高炉、小炒炉，红焰银花，照亮了半个亚洲，太阳从此不往祖国地平线落下。
    绍兴鉴湖畔，打锡箔的叮当变成了鼓风炉的呼啸，惊醒了百草园里那轴古画上的梅花鹿。内蒙古草原上，前年还只有马掌店；今年，一座巨大的钢铁联合企业平地而起。才放下套马杆的牧民，已拿起钢钎，学会了驯服钢铁的烈马。
    钢。巨鲸要脊骨，雄鹰要翅膀。从鞍山到上海，从嘉陵江边到石景山下，给造船厂，给飞机制造厂，送来了掷地铿锵的好钢。
    铁钉也要进口的时代已经过去了。我们用自己汗水炼成的钢，架起长虹，普渡自己到人间天堂！
    人民公社坠地了。起得最早的毛主席，一眼看到了东方这一道红霞，连声夸道：“人民公社好！”话音未落，旭日东升，光芒万丈，刺得蝙蝠们惊慌乱飞。只有三条驴腿的“穷棒子社，”组成了人民公社，买得起拖拉机了。连昨日刚跨出原始公社的佧佤族，也试办起了人民公社。
    五亿农民的欢乐，给“人民公社好！”谱成了气势磅礴的乐章。往日终年愁眉的孤寡老人，今年新春，在敬老院里，也和娃娃们抢放花炮了，嘴唇上沾有红印泥的妇女，用自己的工资，给婆婆买来了第一件节日的礼物。
    人民公社力大无穷，把龙王也牵着鼻子走。今年，水库、水网降住了旱魔，天旱田不干，凤阳姑娘不再背着花鼓，逃荒四方。儿郎们在托儿所里歌唱！
    小学教科书上写的吉林三宝，已不仅是人参、貂皮、靰鞡草，又加上了新的三宝：汽车、染料、肥田粉。在莱比锡国际博览会上，使得观众不忍释手的中国产品，除了古色古香丝、茶，还有精密的仪器和新式的机床。
    自古圣贤皆寂寞，如今尧舜遍天下。南京路上有好八连；雀儿山上有张福林班。给解放军带过路的凉山小奴隶，入党了；曾在旧国会上痛骂过卖国贼的老进士，也加入了无产阶级的先锋队。
    一个向秀丽在烈火中，化成了凤凰飞去；千万个向秀丽在洪水的洗礼中诞生。新中国一个最普通的公民，也比接受洛克菲勒竞选津贴的白宫政客，高尚一千万倍。
    纽约工人双手插在口袋里，排着望不到头的长队，站酸了腿，还没有领到失业救济金。我国大城市的劳动局里，电话铃像夏日蝉鸣，终日不断；这个新建的工厂，那座破土的工地，都来申请快点给调配工人。建设社会主义的人手，我们永远也不会嫌多！
    解放前，你听过黄浦江边报童的叫喊吗？那厂失业工人全家从屋顶花园跳楼自杀了。现在，每逢假日，工人们全家坐在“大世界”里听滑稽戏，今天的生活，使昨日的“包身工”笑出了眼泪。
    1958年以来，祖国这一步跨得多远啊！敌人竭力穷喊：“中国大跃退了！”一点不错，我们的前进，就是他们眼里的后退。我们离他们人吃人的资本主义社会愈来愈远了。新中国人民在旗手毛泽东同志的带领下，正向着伟大的共产主义理想不断迈进！
    1958年以来，祖国的成就是多么辉煌！右倾机会主义分子拍桌大叫：“这可搞糟了！”绣花也有扎手的时候，六亿五千万人民在社会主义革命和建设的道路上，万马奔腾，有几匹马失蹄了，算得什么，何必大惊小怪。怕摔跤的人，躺在保守主义的钢丝床上，去寻你们的好梦吧！
    党的八届八中全会，向我们吹响了继续跃进的号角。总路线的红旗，在绿野上招展似火。中华民族的优秀骑手们，在九百六十万方公里的土地上奋勇前进。看，谁是千里马！
