On Improving Labor Productivity in Industrial Enterprises
Song Zhuqin

Rapidly developing production is the economic law of socialism. There are two ways to develop production: one is to increase manpower, and the other is to continuously improve labor productivity. The fundamental way is to improve labor productivity. The development of Tianjin's industry since liberation can also illustrate this point: During the First Five-Year Plan, Tianjin's total industrial output value increased by 128.32%, with an increase in output value of 2.15 billion yuan, of which 63.38% was achieved by improving labor productivity and 36.62% by increasing the number of workers; the situation in 1958 was even more so. The increase in output value last year alone was 2.68 billion yuan, of which 74.14% was achieved by improving labor productivity and 25.86% by increasing the number of workers.

How to improve labor productivity? The factors and methods for improving labor productivity are multifaceted. As early as a hundred years ago, Marx pointed out: "The productive powers of labour are dependent on various circumstances, amongst others, on the average amount of skill of the workman, the state of science, and the possibilities of its practical application, the social organisation of production, the extent and capabilities of the means of production, and physical conditions." ("Das Kapital," Volume 1, People's Publishing House, page 12.) Marx's teaching is still fully applicable today. To put Marx's words simply, that is: Firstly, the workers' operations are very skilled, and the overall level of operation is very high. Secondly, actively developing scientific research, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and promoting the application of new technologies and new processes are fundamental measures to improve labor productivity. Thirdly, it is necessary to do a good job in the collaboration between industrial departments and between industrial departments and various relevant parties, as well as the labor organization and production collaboration and integration within enterprises. Fourthly, machinery, equipment, raw materials, materials, and fuel power must be well utilized, reduce consumption, practice strict economy, overcome waste, and fully improve the utilization rate of raw materials. In particular, improving product quality is an extremely important issue. Because a factory's products (except for the part directly consumed by society) are often another factory's raw materials or parts (i.e., raw material industry or processing industry), the quality of one enterprise's products has a great impact on the products of other enterprises. Fifthly, other natural conditions, such as the resource reserves in the extractive industries, the impact of natural climate on agriculture, etc. Of course, in addition to this, it is also necessary to "put politics in command," strengthen the political and ideological education of workers and laborers, organize socialist labor competitions, implement the wage system of distribution according to work, and so on.

Although the ways to improve labor productivity are multifaceted, there are key points among them. In the process of production development, each stage or each period should have different priorities according to the different situations of each factory and enterprise. At present, the central task on the industrial front in Tianjin is to oppose right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning slackness, go all out, aim high, and immediately launch a vigorous new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy.

		Both Quantity and Quality Must Be Grasped

The relationship between the major indicators in factories and enterprises, such as output value, output, quality, cost, labor productivity, and profit, is the relationship between more, faster, better, and more economical. There are several indicators that are the focus of these relationships, namely output, quality, and cost.

When grasping the production work of each period, we should focus on certain aspects, that is, sometimes focus on output, and sometimes focus on quality or saving, depending on the specific situation. However, when grasping a key point, we must never give up other aspects; grasping comprehensively can achieve the consistency of "high yield, high quality, and economy." The following examples illustrate this: (Attached chart)

Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1 (Open-hearth Steel)
Paper Mill (Letterpress Paper)
Zengchang Weaving Factory (Cotton Cloth)

From the above figures, it can be clearly seen that output and quality are completely consistent. The statement that high yield cannot be high quality, and high quality cannot be increased in production is one-sided.

Improving quality is closely related to improving labor productivity. First, if the yield rate and pass rate of products increase, the scrap rate and defective products will also decrease, and its output (referring to qualified products) will increase, that is to say, the worker's output per unit time increases, or the man-hours consumed per unit product decreases, which greatly improves labor productivity. Conversely, if the yield rate and pass rate of products decrease, and the scrap rate and defective products increase, that is to say, the same amount of man-hours is consumed, but the unit output (referring to qualified products) is very low, or the amount of labor per unit product is greatly increased, making the production of a qualified product consume more living labor and materialized labor, which directly affects the improvement of labor productivity. Second, excellent product quality, good physical and chemical properties, durability, and aesthetics are the greatest savings for the entire social labor. "From a social point of view, labor productivity increases with the saving of the entire social labor... Improving product quality, such as extending the service life of this or that product, also means the saving of the entire social labor." ("Textbook of Political Economy," Third Edition, pages 490-491.) Conversely, poor product quality, easy damage, and unattractiveness are a waste of social labor.

Comparing several enterprises in Tianjin that produce the same product or the same type of product in July, it can be seen that the highest and lowest pass rates or superior product rates of each enterprise vary greatly:

Steel (Converter) Pass Rate: Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3, 97.22%, lowest enterprise, 94.61%;
Steel (Pass Rate): Steel Rolling Plant No. 3, 99.78%, lowest enterprise, 97.31%;
Castings (Finished Product Rate): Turbine Plant, 94.28%, lowest enterprise, 39.21%;
Cotton Yarn (Superior First-Grade Product Rate): Cotton Spinning Mill No. 1, 100%, lowest enterprise, 19.12%;
Printed and Dyed Cloth (First-Grade Product Rate): First Printing and Dyeing Factory, 96.30%, lowest enterprise, 90.06%.

The above table proves that if the low enterprises learn from the highest enterprises and strive to improve, it will play a great role in improving product quality, saving raw materials, increasing output, and improving labor productivity.

		Both Quality and Economy Are Required

Saving is the principle of building socialism. Building the country with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift are the ways to make our country prosperous and strong. Especially at present, overcoming waste, saving raw materials, and producing more and better-quality products with relatively few raw materials are of important practical significance for improving labor productivity and accelerating China's socialist construction. Saving must be carried out under the condition of ensuring the improvement of product quality. If corners are cut and quality is reduced, that kind of so-called "saving" is actually a waste. Judging from the current production situation in Tianjin, the amount of raw materials consumed by enterprises producing the same product varies greatly under the premise of ensuring quality; this shows that the potential for saving is great, and some enterprises have waste that should be overcome. The following are examples of the situation in July:

Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3 (Converter): The quality is better, and the pass rate is as high as 97.22%, but the consumption is low. The consumption of pig iron per ton of steel (calculated according to refining one ton of qualified steel, the same below) is 1,499 kilograms; while the pass rate of another steel plant is 94.67%, and the consumption of pig iron is 1,703 kilograms. The difference is very large.

The standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of Tianjin Power Plant No. 1 is 0.504 kilograms, while another enterprise is 0.735 kilograms.

Tianjin Chemical Plant (producing caustic soda): The utilization rate of salt is 92.1%, and the coal consumption (calculated according to producing one ton of caustic soda) is 0.34 tons; the salt utilization rate of another chemical plant is only 69.49%, and the coal consumption is 0.44 tons.

Zhongda Paper Mill's letterpress paper: The yield rate is 98.81%, and the amount of pulp consumed per ton is 1,043.54 kilograms; the yield rate of another enterprise is 85.85%, and the amount of pulp consumed is 1,334.31 kilograms.

The above figures show that the higher the product quality, the lower its consumption, and conversely, the lower the quality, the higher the consumption. This principle is easy to understand. The higher the yield rate, pass rate, and harvest rate, the lower the defective product rate, then there will be no waste; conversely, if the yield rate, pass rate, and harvest rate are low, and the defective product rate is high, of course, the consumption will be high. From this, it can be seen that quality and saving (that is, cost) can also be made consistent. If the above-mentioned high-consumption enterprises learn from the low-consumption enterprises, then a large amount of raw materials can be saved, thereby producing more products, thereby achieving the unity of output, quality, and saving.

Carefully Adjust Labor Organization and Save Labor

Whether the labor organization is reasonable and whether there is waste of labor is closely related to improving labor productivity. According to the general law, the growth of labor force in factories and enterprises should be lower than the speed of production development, and not higher than the speed of production development. Our experience over the years has proved this point. That is, in the second half of last year, although the number of people increased more, the overall growth rate of labor force was still much lower than the speed of production development. Last year, the labor productivity of Tianjin's employees was 13,230 yuan, an increase of 47.79% compared with 1957. The labor productivity of production workers was 17,852 yuan, an increase of 43.7% compared with 1957. This growth figure is very high and is indeed a great leap forward. But we must admit that some enterprises did increase more people last year. People who should not have been increased were increased, and those who should have been increased less were increased more, forming a waste. The labor productivity of these enterprises seems very low. If we can control it well and reduce the number of people, then the growth rate of labor productivity last year would be even higher.

In the current tense production season, some enterprises are again asking for an increase in workers. It cannot be denied that some enterprises need to increase people, and they should try their best to solve it through internal adjustment. However, can production be developed at a high speed without increasing workers? It is very possible. Let us give a few examples from the Great Leap Forward last year to illustrate: (Attached chart) Zengchang Weaving Factory: Dafeng Bridge Flour Mill:

One of the significant signs of improved labor productivity is the increase in the number of products per unit time or the reduction in the man-hour consumption for manufacturing unit products. This requirement must be continuously improved. Although the factors are multifaceted—especially reflected in the level of mechanization—the quality of labor organization and whether the work efficiency of each worker is fully utilized are very important. The man-hour consumption for manufacturing unit products varies greatly among enterprises in Tianjin that produce the same product. It can be seen from the following figures (statistics for April this year): To manufacture a C615 lathe, the First Machine Tool Plant only uses 412 man-hours, while another enterprise needs 700 man-hours; the molding time for each rickshaw tire, the enterprise with high time consumption is 4.5 minutes, and the enterprise with low time consumption is only 1.5 minutes. The average output per worker in various enterprises producing the same product also varies greatly. For example, the highest enterprise for converter steel produces 6.89 tons per worker per month, while the lowest enterprise produces 1.28 tons per month; the highest enterprise for electricity produces 113,400 kilowatt-hours per worker per month, while the lowest enterprise produces 16,900 kilowatt-hours per worker per month; the highest enterprise for paper produces 1.99 tons per worker per month, while the lowest enterprise produces 0.77 tons per worker per month.

The quality of labor organization is also a sign of assessing enterprise management. Every factory must improve labor quotas, streamline personnel, and scientifically adjust labor organization while vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. For example, adjust organizational structure, rationally set up workshops, work sections, and groups, scientifically organize work procedures, scientifically organize worker operation collaboration, strengthen production scheduling, and adjust work shifts, etc. Many factories have made significant achievements in this regard. Tianjin Spring Factory, this year's task has increased by 13.5 times compared with last year. According to the opinions of the masses, they changed the workers watching the reverberatory furnace from six people watching one unit to eleven people watching five units, saving 30% of the labor quota; the blanking of leaf springs implemented mechanization, using punch shearing machines instead of manual cutting, saving 50% of the personnel quota, but the output per shift increased by 1.25 times. These two items alone saved more than 160 labor forces. In addition, they also strengthened labor collaboration in view of the characteristics of many people and few machines in the factory, promoted the assembly line operation method, and started from improving enterprise management, solved the problems of production delays, temporary work assignments, tool chaos, untimely materials, and so on. This year, the labor productivity of the employees of this factory will increase by 5.57 times.

		Improve and Enhance Enterprise Management

To achieve "high yield, high quality, and economy" and improve labor productivity, it is necessary to vigorously rectify and improve rules and regulations and strengthen enterprise management. Continuously improve the management level of enterprises.

To improve rules and regulations and improve the work of enterprise management, we must focus on production tasks. What is grasped in production should focus on improving what rules and regulations, and correspondingly improve other necessary systems. In Tianjin, in conjunction with improving and improving product quality in the recent period, technical management systems have been improved; at the same time, necessary planning management, financial management, and safety systems have also been improved. In terms of technical management, management systems for product design and formulation, ingredient preparation have been established and improved, and process regulations and design requirements are strictly observed. All changes in product structure and the use of alternative raw materials must be tested to ensure product quality, and the consent of the user unit, design unit, and approval of relevant higher-level authorities must be obtained. Strictly abide by operating procedures, and changes in operating methods must be tested, summarized, and proved to be effective before being promoted. Restore and adhere to the cleaning, maintenance, and maintenance system for machines to maintain machines and equipment and ensure full utilization. Establish and improve the identification system for tools, cards, measuring tools, and inspection tools, and improve their supply. What is especially important is to improve and strictly implement the product quality inspection system, establish and restore full-time institutions and full-time personnel for managing quality work, and combine it with mass inspection work. This is one of the important measures to ensure product quality. From raw materials and semi-finished products to finished products leaving the factory, each factory must have a set of testing, inspection, and inspection systems. Unqualified raw materials are generally not allowed to be put into production; unqualified parts are not allowed to be assembled; finished products that do not meet the standards are not allowed to leave the factory. All kinds of new products must be tested repeatedly and technically appraised by relevant units before they can be formally put into production. In terms of production planning management, we should focus on doing a good job in operation planning, strengthen production scheduling, and correspondingly improve the statistical system. In terms of financial and cost management, we should start with formulating or revising consumption quotas, and correspondingly rectify and improve material management systems, material requisition and return systems, warehouse management systems, and capital management systems, strengthen cost analysis, and promote group economic accounting. In conjunction with rectifying labor organization, it is necessary to do a good job in various systems such as personnel quotas, labor force allocation, attendance, and rewards.

It must be pointed out here that we are not doing this to "revive" the old set of systems before the "great destruction and great establishment" last year, but measures that must be taken based on the new situation and new needs of our enterprises. After the "great destruction and great establishment" last year, fundamental changes have taken place in our enterprises: the absolute leadership of the party over enterprises has been established, the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the party committee and the workers' representative assembly system under the leadership of the party committee have been implemented more firmly, and the system of workers directly participating in management with "two participations and three combinations" has been implemented, greatly breaking down old rules and regulations, establishing new systems, and thoroughly implementing the policy of combining centralized leadership and vigorously carrying out mass movements. Therefore, productive forces have been greatly liberated, the enthusiasm of the masses has been promoted, and the Great Leap Forward in production has been promoted. The achievements are great and must be affirmed. The only shortcomings are that in the process of vigorously carrying out mass movements and reforming enterprise management, there have been some phenomena of neglecting centralized leadership and overdoing the reform of certain systems. Compared with the great achievements, the shortcomings are only one finger out of ten. Experience has proved that we have the foundation of the Great Leap Forward last year and the rich experience of vigorously carrying out mass movements last year, which is extremely beneficial for rectifying and improving rules and regulations and improving enterprise management. Therefore, when we improve enterprise management, we must continue to follow the mass line, fully mobilize and rely on the masses, and gradually improve according to the opinions of the masses and the needs of the enterprise. Marxist dialectics believes that the laws of the development of things are all spiral rises. Rules and regulations embody the centralized leadership of enterprises. If we relied too much on rules and regulations to manage enterprises before the "great destruction and great establishment" last year, restricting the enthusiasm of the masses, then after the "great destruction and great establishment," the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses have been greatly promoted; but centralized leadership has been somewhat relaxed. Now, after further improvement, will a new development not appear again!

Vigorously Carry Out Mass Movements and Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution

To achieve "high yield, high quality, and economy" and improve labor productivity at a high speed, it is necessary to vigorously carry out mass movements and technical innovation and technical revolution. According to past experience, technical innovation and technical revolution must closely revolve around production tasks and serve production; at the same time, they must also have far-reaching goals, conduct scientific research in a planned way, and climb technical peaks, so as to make technical innovation and technical revolution a mass movement, thereby achieving great results and continuously promoting the Great Leap Forward in production.

To use fewer raw materials to manufacture more and better products, we must start by attacking technology. Many factories have made outstanding achievements in this regard. They actively improve product design and formulations, strive to adopt new technologies, improve processes and operating methods, and strengthen the processing and treatment of raw materials, etc., to achieve high yield, high quality, and saving. The Qi Zisheng group of Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1—a red banner of high yield and high quality in the city—adopted the "three-step desulfurization method" to refine high-sulfur iron with as many as 200 sulfur elements into high-quality steel containing only 49 sulfur elements that fully meets national standards; Dalu Rubber Factory and Dachina Rubber Factory used "blanket rubber" (a kind of low-quality raw material) to manufacture rubber shoes whose various physical performance indicators exceeded the national standards. Product quality is not only very stable, but also constantly improving. There are countless examples like this.

The vast number of enterprise employees also adopted both foreign and local methods to actively increase raw materials; vigorously carry out saving, substitution, and comprehensive utilization, which not only improves quality but also reduces consumption. The "clever tailor" movement carried out in Tianjin's machinery and electronics, leather, clothing and other industries has saved a lot of raw materials such as steel; most factories in the machinery and electronics industry have adopted methods such as adding hot air to iron melting furnaces and desulfurization in front of the furnace to create conditions for the use of white pig iron.

Actively restoring the production of old products needed by the market and striving to increase new varieties are one of the important tasks of the current technical innovation and technical revolution. Some old products that are very much needed by the market and welcomed by the masses were once discontinued or reduced in production, and are now being actively restored to production; effective measures must be taken to maintain the continued production of these products. At the same time, special attention should be paid to the trial production and increased production of new products that have raw material sources and are needed by the state and the market, which is an important way to increase production. It is also necessary to strive to trial-produce and produce "high, precise, and large" products and strengthen the scientific and technological research work of new products and new technologies.

To insist on "increasing production without increasing people," we must continuously improve the level of mechanization. In gradually realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, we should not only pay attention to making the already mechanized processes go to a higher level and develop towards automation and continuity, but also pay special attention to those manual operation departments that seem to be not major sections (such as handling, loading and unloading, feeding, finished products, packaging, carpentry, forging, etc.) but occupy a lot of labor force. These departments can often save a lot of labor force by slightly improving the tools, and eliminate heavy physical labor, greatly improving labor productivity. Tianjin is one of China's industrial bases, and generally speaking, the degree of mechanization is relatively high. However, it is also necessary to make a specific analysis. In a large enterprise, if you look at its main production process and main workshops, the degree of mechanization is indeed very high, but there are still many auxiliary workshops or work sections, where there are still many manual labor or even heavy physical labor. Dagu Chemical Plant is a modern large enterprise. Its main production workshops: caustic soda, chlorine, hexachlorobenzene, power and other workshops are all modern equipment; from the perspective of the workshop, about 70% are mechanized. However, there are also slag removal, transportation, boilers, etc., which are all manual operations; the metal sodium workshop, welders, etc., are semi-mechanized operations. These departments occupy several times or even dozens of times more labor force than the main production workshops. Therefore, if we divide from the operation of production workers, we can see that the proportion of mechanization is still very low. The plant actually has 2,889 production workers (statistics at the beginning of this year), 243 people engaged in mechanized operations, accounting for only 8.42%; 768 people engaged in semi-mechanized operations, accounting for 26.58%; 1,878 people engaged in manual operations, accounting for 65%. Among the number of people engaged in manual operations, there are also more than 700 people in boilers, loading and unloading, transportation, etc., accounting for about 37% of the number of manual operations and are heavy physical labor. Looking at the city as a whole, according to the statistics of 400,000 production workers (statistics at the beginning of this year), 25% are engaged in mechanized operations, 18% are semi-mechanized, and 57% are manual. From this, the general situation can be seen. Technical innovation and technical revolution must break through these weak links in order to liberate a large amount of labor force and rapidly improve labor productivity.

At present, strengthening the technical and cultural education of workers plays an important role in promoting the development of technical innovation and technical revolution. Because the proportion of new workers in our factories is very large. Most of them only have about one year of learning and operational training. Although generally speaking, progress is very rapid, the proficiency of technical operations is still relatively low. Just as Marx said: The operating proficiency of laborers has an extremely important relationship to labor productivity. Our experience has also proved this point. In order to draw everyone's special attention to this issue, here is a comparison between Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3 (a plant with many old workers) and Tianjin Steel Plant No. 2 Branch and Tianjin Steel Plant No. 4 (both plants with many new workers): (Attached chart)

1958 December Data

Although the reasons for the above differences are multifaceted, the operating proficiency of the workers is a very important factor. Therefore, we must take various methods, such as vigorously promoting advanced operating experience, strengthening spare-time technical and cultural learning, respecting teachers and loving apprentices, etc., and strive to improve the operating skills of workers, especially new workers, which is a very important task.

The red banner competition movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution launched in Tianjin, with "four same" (same industry, same type of work, same product, same business) and "seven comparisons" (comparing output, comparing quality, comparing variety, comparing cost, comparing labor productivity, comparing collaboration, comparing safety) and "five good" (production group unity is good, production is good, participation in management is good, cultural and technical learning is good, safety and hygiene are good), is both vigorous and down-to-earth, and has achieved great results. The method adopted in carrying out this movement is to widely and deeply promote advanced experience and launch a large-scale upsurge of competition of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced." Tianjin has selected advanced models in various industries and trades according to the requirements of "high yield, high quality, and saving": advanced factories, workshops, groups, and individuals, and has established a number of distinct red banners. Their advanced ideas and advanced technical experience have had a profound impact on the workers in the city. At the same time, various industries, districts, and factories have also selected "pace-setters" and are widely and specifically organizing the promotion of these experiences. At the same time, advanced technical and economic indicators of various products were also selected, such as: product physical and chemical performance indicators, yield rate, superior product rate, man-hour quotas, and consumption quotas, etc. Summarize experience, and through various forms, such as professional conferences, evaluation meetings, and experience exchange meetings, widely publicize advanced ideas and introduce advanced experience to employees, and vigorously launch the movement of "comparing, learning, and catching up." As long as we can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees, vigorously carry out the competition movement, wave after wave, and continuously promote a new upsurge in production, we will surely be able to achieve one great victory after another on the production front.

    论工业企业提高劳动生产率
    宋祝勤
    高速度地发展生产，是社会主义的经济规律。发展生产的途径有二：一是靠增加人；一是靠不断地提高劳动生产率。而根本的途径则是提高劳动生产率。从解放以来，天津市工业发展的情况也可说明这个问题：在第一个五年计划期间，天津市工业总产值共增长了128.32％，增加产值为二十一点五亿元，其中依靠提高劳动生产率得来的占63.38％，靠增加工人得来的占36.62％；1958年的情况更是如此，去年一年增加的产值是二十六点八亿元，其中依靠提高劳动生产率得来的占74.14％，靠增加工人得来的占25.86％。
    怎样提高劳动生产率呢？提高劳动生产率的因素和办法是多方面的。早在一百年前马克思曾指出：“劳动的生产力，取决于多种事情，就中，有劳动者熟练的平均程度，科学及其技术应用的发展程度，生产过程的社会结合，生产资料的范围及作用能力，和诸种自然状况。”（“资本论”第一卷，人民出版社一二页。）马克思的这一教导，拿到现在也是完全适用的。如果把马克思的话通俗点说，那就是：其一，工人操作很熟练，总的操作水平很高。其二，积极发展科学研究，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，推广应用新技术、新工艺，这是提高劳动生产率的根本措施。其三，必须搞好工业部门之间和工业部门与各有关方面的协作，以及企业内部的劳动组织和生产的协作、结合。其四，机器、设备、原料、材料、燃料动力必须很好地利用，降低消耗，厉行节约，克服浪费，充分提高原材料的利用率。特别是提高产品的质量，是一个极其重要的问题。因为一个工厂的产品（除了社会直接消费的那一部分以外）往往就是另一个工厂的原材料或配件（即原材料工业或加工工业），一个企业的产品的质量好坏，对其他企业产品影响很大。其五，其他自然条件，例如采掘业的资源蕴藏量，在农业上天然气候的影响，等等。当然，除此以外，还必须要“政治挂帅”，加强对于工人、劳动者的政治思想教育，组织社会主义劳动竞赛，执行按劳分配的工资制度，等等。
    提高劳动生产率的途径虽然是多方面的，但其中是有重点的。在生产发展的过程中，每个阶段或每个时期，根据各个工厂企业情况的不同，都应有不同的重点。当前，天津市在工业战线上的中心任务就是要反对右倾思想和右倾松劲情绪，鼓足干劲，力争上游，立即掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约新高潮。
          既要抓产量，又要抓质量
    工厂企业中的产值、产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率、利润，几个大指标的关系，也就是多、快、好、省的关系。有几个指标是它们之间的重心，这就是产量、质量、成本。
    在抓每一个时期的生产工作时，是应该有所侧重的，即有的时候重点抓产量，有的时候重点抓质量或节约，这要看具体情况而定。但是，在抓一个重点时，绝不可以放弃其他的方面；抓得全面的就能够做到“高产、优质、节约”的一致。举以下几个例子来说明：（附图表）
    天钢一厂（平炉钢）
    造纸总厂（凸板纸）
    增昌织布厂（棉布）
    从以上数字，可以明显地看出产量和质量是完全一致的。那些认为高产就不能优质，优质就不能增产的说法是片面的。
    提高质量与提高劳动生产率的关系至为密切。一是，如果产品的成品率、合格率增高，报废率和残次品也就会减少，它的产量（指合格产品）就会增高，就是说，工人的单位时间的产量增加，或说单位产品所消耗的工时减少了，这就大大提高了劳动生产率。相反，产品的成品率、合格率降低，报废率和残次品增多，这就是说，消耗了同样的工时，但单位产量（指合格的）很低，或者说大大增加了单位产品的劳动量，使生产一个合格产品消耗更多的活劳动和物化劳动，这就直接影响了劳动生产率的提高。二是，产品质量优良，物理化学性能很好，经久耐用，而且美观，那是对于整个社会劳动的最大节约。“从社会观点来看，劳动生产率是随着整个社会的劳动的节约而增长的……。提高产品质量，例如延长这种或那种制品的使用期限，同样也意味着整个社会的劳动的节约。”（“政治经济学教科书”第三版第490——491页）相反，产品质量不好，易损易坏，且不美观，那就是对于社会劳动的浪费了。
    拿天津市7月份几种生产同一种产品的企业或同工种的产品作一个比较，可以看出各企业最高与最低的合格率或上等品率悬殊很大：
    钢（转炉）合格率：天钢三厂97.22％，最低企业94.61％；
  钢材（合格率）：轧钢三厂99.78％，最低企业97.31％；
    铸件（成品率）：汽轮机厂94.28％，最低企业39.21％；
    棉纱（上等一级品率）：棉纺一厂100％，最低企业19.12％；
    印染布（一等品率）：第一印染厂96.30％，最低企业90.06％。
    上表证明：如果低的企业都向最高的企业看齐，并且再力争提高，那么，对于提高产品质量和节约原材料、增加产量、提高劳动生产率，都将起很大的作用。
            既要优质　又要节约
    节约，是建设社会主义的原则。勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业，是我们国家的富强之道。特别在当前，克服浪费，节约原材料，以比较少的原材料，生产更多的和质量优良的产品，对提高劳动生产率，加速我国社会主义建设，有着重要的现实意义。节约，必须在保证提高产品质量的条件之下进行，如果偷工减料，降低质量，那一种所谓“节约”实际上是一种浪费。从天津当前生产情况看，生产同一产品的企业，在保证质量的前提下，消耗的原材料多少悬殊很大；这就说明节约的潜力很大，有的企业存在着浪费，应该努力克服。就7月份情况举例如下：
    天钢三厂（转炉）：质量较好，合格率达97.22％，但消耗量却低，每吨钢消耗生铁（按炼一吨合格钢计算，下同）为一千四百九十九公斤；而另一钢厂的合格率为94.67％，消耗生铁则为一千七百零三公斤。相差很多。
    天津发电一厂每度电标准耗煤零点五零四公斤，另一企业为零点七三五公斤。
    天津化工厂（生产烧碱）：食盐利用率92.1％，煤耗（按生产一吨烧碱计）零点三四吨；另一化工厂食盐利用率只为69.49％，煤耗零点四四吨。
    中达造纸厂凸板纸：成品率98.81％，每吨耗浆量为一千零四十三点五四公斤；另一企业成品率为85.85％，耗浆量达一千三百三十四点三一公斤。
    上述数字可以看出，产品质量高，它的消耗往往很低，相反，质量低的，消耗反而大。这个道理是容易理解的，成品率、合格率、收获率高，残次品率很低，那就不会有什么浪费；相反，如果成品率、合格率、收获率低，残次品率高，当然消耗就高了。由此可见，质量与节约（也即成本）也是能够做得一致的。上述消耗高的企业，如果都向消耗低的企业看齐，那么，就可节约出一大笔原材料，从而生产出更多的产品来，从而也就做到了产量、质量、节约三者的统一。
    认真调整劳动组织，节约劳动力
    劳动组织是否合理，有无浪费劳动力的情况，对于提高劳动生产率的关系极为密切。按照一般的规律，工厂企业劳动力的增长应低于生产发展的速度，而不能高于生产发展的速度。我们历年的经验都证明了这一点，就是在去年下半年，虽然增人较多，但总的劳动力的增长速度仍较生产发展的速度低得多。去年天津市职工劳动生产率为一万三千二百三十元，比1957年提高47.79％，生产工人劳动生产率一万七千八百五十二元，比1957年提高43.7％。这个增长的数字是很高的，确是一个大跃进。但我们要承认，去年确实有些企业增人较多，不应该增人的也增了，应该少增的多增了，形成浪费。这些企业的劳动生产率显得很低。假如我们能够控制得好，少增加一些人，那么，去年劳动生产率的增长速度将是更高的。
    在当前生产紧张的季节，有些企业又要求增加工人。不能否认，有的企业增人是需要的，应当尽量经过内部调剂来解决。但是，不增加工人能不能高速度地发展生产呢？十分可能。我们举去年大跃进时几个例证来说明：（附图表）增昌织布厂：大丰桥面粉厂：
    劳动生产率提高的显著标志之一，是使单位时间的产品数量增加，或者制造单位产品的工时消耗减少。要不断地提高这种要求，虽然因素是多方面的——特别表现在机械化程度的高低上，但劳动力组织得好坏，是否充分地发挥了每个劳动者的工作效率，有着很重要的关系。天津市生产同产品的企业，制造单位产品的工时消耗悬殊很大。从下列数字可以看出（今年4月份统计）：制作C615车床，第一机床厂只用四百一十二个工时，而另一企业需要七百个工时；制造每条力车外胎成型时间，耗时多的企业为四点五分钟，耗时低的企业只一点五分钟。生产同产品的各个企业每一工人平均产量悬殊也很大，如转炉钢最高企业每个工人每月生产六点八九吨，而最低企业每月生产一点二八吨；电力最高企业每个工人每月生产十一点三四万度，而最低企业每个工人每月生产一点六九万度；纸张最高企业每个工人每月生产一点九九吨，而最低企业每个工人每月生产零点七七吨。
    劳动组织组织得好坏，也是考核企业管理工作的标志。每个工厂必须在大搞技术革新和技术革命的同时，搞好劳动定额，精简人员，科学地调整劳动组织。例如，调整组织机构，合理地设置车间、工段、小组，科学地组织工序，科学地组织工人操作协作，加强生产调度，调整作业班次，等等。有许多厂在这方面做出了显著的成绩。天津弹簧厂，今年任务比去年增加了十三点五倍，他们根据群众意见，把看反射炉的工人由六人看一台变为十一人看五台，劳动定额节约了30％；板簧下料实行了机械化，用冲剪机代替人工裁料，人员定额节约了50％，台班产量却提高了一点二五倍。仅此两项，就节约了一百六十余个劳动力。此外，他们又针对全厂人多、机器少的特点，加强了劳动协作，推行流水作业法，并从改进企业管理上着手，解决了生产窝工、临时派活、工具混乱、料不及时，等等。今年这个厂的职工劳动生产率将提高五点五七倍。
        改进与提高企业的管理工作
    做到“高产、优质、节约”，提高劳动生产率，必须大力整顿与健全规章制度，加强企业的管理。不断地提高企业的管理水平。
    改进规章制度，提高企业管理的工作，必须针对生产任务，生产上抓什么，就着重改进什么规章制度，并相应地改进其他必须的制度。天津市在最近一个时期，结合改进与提高产品质量的工作，着重改进了技术管理制度；同时，也改进了必需的计划管理和财务管理与安全制度。在技术管理方面，建立和健全了产品设计和配方、配料的管理制度，严格遵守工艺规程和设计要求。凡是改变产品结构、采用代用原料的，必须经过试验，确能保证产品质量，并征得使用单位、设计单位的同意和有关上级机关的批准。严格遵守操作规程，改变操作方法要经过试验、总结，证明确实有效，然后推广。恢复和坚持对机器的清洁、检修和保养制度，维护机器、设备，保证充分利用。建立与健全工、卡、量、检具的鉴定制度，并改善它们的供应情况。尤其重要的，必须健全和严格执行产品质量的检验制度，建立和恢复管理质量工作的专职机构和专职人员，并与群众性的检验工作相结合，这是保证产品质量的重要措施之一。各工厂，从原材料、半成品到成品出厂，都要有一套化验、检查和检验制度。不合格的原料，一般不准投入生产；不合格的配件，不准装配；达不到标准的成品，不准出厂。各种新产品，要经过反复试验并经有关单位技术鉴定后，方能正式投入生产。在生产计划管理方面，要着重做好作业计划，加强生产调度，相应地健全统计制度。在财务、成本管理方面，应该从制订或修订消耗定额入手，相应地整顿与健全物资管理制度、领退料制度、仓库管理制度和资金管理制度，加强成本分析，推广小组经济核算。结合整顿劳动组织，要搞好人员定额，劳动力调配、考勤、奖励等各项制度。
    这里必须指出，我们这样做，并不是使去年“大破大立”以前的那一套旧制度“死灰复燃”，而是根据我们企业新的形势和新的需要所必须采取的措施。经过去年“大破大立”，我们企业里发生了根本性的变化：树立了党对企业的绝对领导，更加坚强地实行了党委领导下的厂长负责制和党委领导下的职工代表大会制，实行了“两参、三结合”的工人直接参加管理的制度，大破陈规旧律，建立新制度，彻底地实行了集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针。因此，大大解放了生产力，发扬了群众的积极性，促进了生产的大跃进。成绩很大，必须肯定。其缺点只不过是，在大搞群众运动和改革企业管理工作的过程中，有某些忽视集中领导和对某些制度改革过了“头”的现象。缺点与伟大成绩相比，不过十个指头中的一个指头而已。经验证明，我们有去年大跃进的基础，有去年大搞群众运动的丰富经验，对于整顿和健全规章制度，提高企业的管理，是极其有利的。因此，我们在改进企业管理工作时，必须继续走群众路线，充分发动群众与依靠群众，根据群众的意见和企业的需要，逐步加以改进。马克思主义辩证法认为，事物的发展规律都是螺旋式的上升。规章制度是体现企业的集中领导的。如果说在去年“大破大立”以前，我们有些过分地依靠规章制度管理企业，限制了群众的积极性，那么，“大破大立”以后，是大大发扬了群众的积极性和创造性；但在集中领导方面又显得松弛了些。现在，经过进一步改进，不就又将出现一个新发展吗！
  大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新、技术革命
    做到“高产、优质、节约”，高速度地提高劳动生产率，必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新、技术革命。根据以往经验，技术革新与技术革命必须紧紧围绕生产任务，为生产服务；同时也要有远大的目标，有计划地进行科学研究，攀登技术高峰，才能使技术革新和技术革命形成为群众性的运动，并从而取得巨大的效果，不断促进生产的大跃进。
    使用少的原材料，制造出多的和好的产品来，必须从猛攻技术入手。许多厂在这方面做出了出色的成绩。他们积极地改善产品的设计和配方，努力采用新技术，改进工艺和操作方法，加强原材料的加工处理，等等，做到了高产、优质和节约。天钢一厂齐子升小组——全市高产、优质的一面红旗，采用“三步脱硫法”，使高达二百多个硫磺的高硫铁，炼成含硫仅有四十九个完全合乎国家标准的优质钢；大陆橡胶厂和大中华橡胶厂，利用“毛毯胶”（一种质量次的原料），制造成各项物理性能指标都超过了国家规定的标准的胶鞋。产品质量不仅已很稳定，而且还在不断提高。类此事例，不胜枚举。
    广大企业职工，还采取洋、土并举的方法，积极地增产原材料；大搞节约、代用，综合利用，既提高质量，又降低了消耗。天津市机电、皮革、服装等行业开展的“巧裁缝”运动，节约了大量的钢材等原材料；机电工业大多数厂采用了化铁炉加暖风、炉前脱硫等办法，为使用白口铁创造条件。
    积极恢复市场需要的老产品的生产，努力增加新品种，是当前技术革新和技术革命的重要任务之一。有些市场上十分需要、并为群众所欢迎的老产品，曾一度停产或减产了，现正在积极恢复生产；必须采取切实的措施，保持这些产品继续生产。同时，要特别注意试制和增产那些有原材料来源，又为国家和市场需要的新产品，这是增产的一个重要途径。还要努力试制和生产“高、精、大”的产品，加强新产品、新技术的科学技术研究工作。
    要坚持做到“增产不增人”，必须不断地提高机械化水平。在逐步实现机械化、半机械化方面，不仅要注意使已经机械化的工序更上一层楼，向自动化、连续化发展，而且应该特别注意那些看来虽然不是主要工段（例如，搬运、装卸、进料、成品、包装、木工、锻工等等），但却占用劳动力很多的手工操作部门。这些部门往往把工具稍加改良，就可节约很多的劳动力，并且消灭了笨重的体力劳动，大大地提高劳动生产率。天津是我国工业基地之一，一般说机械化的程度是比较高的。但也要做具体地分析，在一个大型的企业里，如果从其主要生产过程和主要车间来看，的确机械化程度是很高的，但是，还有不少辅助性车间或工段，那里还有不少的手工劳动，甚或笨重的体力劳动。大沽化工厂是个现代化的大企业，它的主要生产车间：烧碱、氯气、六氯苯、动力等车间，都是现代化的设备；从车间来说，70％左右都是机械化的。但是，另外还有清渣、转运、锅炉等等，都是手工操作；金属钠车间、电焊工等等，是半机械化操作，这些部门占有远比主要生产车间多几倍、十几倍的劳动力。因此，如果从生产工人操作来划分，那么，就看出机械化的比重还是很低的。这个厂实有生产工人为二千八百八十九人，（今年年初统计）从事机械化操作的二百四十三人，只占8.42％；从事半机械化操作的七百六十八人，占26.58％；从事手工操作的一千八百七十八人，占65％。在从事手工操作的人数中，还有锅炉、装卸、转运等七百余人，占手工操作人数约37％是笨重体力劳动。再就全市来看，据四十万生产工人的统计（今年年初统计），从事机械化操作的占25％，半机械化的18％，手工操作的57％。由此，可见一般。技术革新和技术革命必须突破这些薄弱的环节，才能大量地解放劳动力，迅速地提高劳动生产率。
    当前，加强工人的技术、文化教育，对于推动技术革新与技术革命的发展有重要的作用。因为我们工厂中，新工人占的比重很大。他们大部分只有一年左右的学习和操作锻炼，虽然一般说来进步都很快，但技术操作的熟练程度还比较低。正像马克思所讲的：劳动者的操作熟练程度，对于劳动生产率有着极其重要的关系。我们的经验也证明了这一点。为了引起大家特别注意这个问题，这里用天钢三厂（老工人多的厂）和天钢二厂二分厂、天钢四厂（都是新工人多的厂）作比较如下：（附图表）
                                   1958年12月份资料
    上述差别的原因，虽是多方面的，但工人的操作熟练程度是个很重要的因素。因此，我们必须采取各种方法，例如大力推广先进操作经验，加强业余技术、文化学习，尊师爱徒等工作，努力提高工人、特别是新工人的操作技术，是个非常重要的工作。
    天津市开展的“四同”（同行业、同工种、同产品、同业务）、“七比”（比产量、比质量、比品种、比成本、比劳动生产率、比协作、比安全）、“五好”（生产小组团结好、生产好、参加管理好、文化技术学习好、安全卫生好）的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，取得了很大的成绩。开展这一运动所采取的方法，就是要广泛、深入地推广先进经验，大规模地掀起“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的竞赛热潮。天津市已经按照“高产、优质、节约”的要求，选择了各行各业的先进典型：先进厂、车间、小组和个人，树立了一批鲜明的红旗。他们的先进思想和先进技术经验，已经在全市工人中引起了深刻的影响。同时，各行业、各区、各厂也都分别选出了“标兵”，正在广泛地具体地组织推广这些经验。与此同时，还选择了各种产品的先进技术经济指标，例如：产品物理化学性能指标，成品率、上等品率，工时定额和消耗定额等等。总结经验，通过各种形式，如专业会议、评比会议、经验交流会等形式，分别向职工广泛宣传先进思想、介绍先进经验，大张旗鼓地开展起“比、学、赶”的运动。只要我们能够充分地调动广大职工群众的积极性、创造性，把竞赛运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，一浪推一浪，不断地促进生产的新高潮，我们就一定能够在生产战线上取得一个接一个的大胜利。
