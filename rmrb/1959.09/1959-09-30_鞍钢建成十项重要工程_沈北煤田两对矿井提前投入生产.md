Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 29th - More than 20,000 construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have victoriously fulfilled their pledge to dedicate themselves to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation: completing ten important projects ahead of schedule in September. These ten projects include: the No. 1 rotary kiln of the Dashiqiao Magnesite Brick Factory, the filtration workshop of the East Anshan Ore Dressing Plant, six preheating boilers of the Rolling Mill, two heavy-duty cranes of the Steelmaking Plant, the ore dressing system of the Gongchangling Ore Dressing Plant, as well as two generators, gas pipelines, cooling towers, and so on. The company's construction plan for September was overfulfilled by 5% three days ahead of schedule.

After proposing the pledge to dedicate themselves to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation at the mobilization meeting in early September, the construction army of Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a vigorous rapid construction competition. The No. 1 rotary kiln project of the Dashiqiao Magnesite Brick Factory was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of September, but after discussion, the workers compressed the completion date to September 25. In the construction process, the workers promoted advanced experiences such as integral assembly and assembly line operation methods, and as a result, it was completed on September 17 and started kiln production on the 27th.

The early completion and commissioning of these ten important projects has solved the key production problems of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, such as the current insufficient supply of certain raw materials and insufficient power facilities, creating conditions for Anshan Iron and Steel to overfulfill the fourth quarter and annual iron and steel production leap forward plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th - On the newly developed Shenbei Coalfield, another two pairs of mechanized mine shafts have been formally handed over to production ahead of schedule. These two pairs of mine shafts are the Qingshuitai No. 2 and No. 3 inclined shafts belonging to the Shenbei Coal Mine, each with an annual production capacity of 210,000 tons. This year, they will increase the nation's coal production by 80,000 tons.

The Shenbei Coalfield is located north of Shenyang. It is a large coalfield discovered by coal geological exploration personnel in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, who displayed the spirit of daring to think and dare to act, breaking the Japanese fallacy that "there is no coal in the Shenbei Plain." Following the commissioning of Qingshuitai No. 2 and No. 3 inclined shafts, another two pairs of mine shafts—Qiantun No. 2 and No. 3—are also accelerating their construction pace and will soon be completed.

    鞍钢建成十项重要工程
    沈北煤田两对矿井提前投入生产
    据新华社鞍山29日电  鞍山钢铁公司两万多名建设工人胜利地实现了向建国十周年献礼的保证：提前在9月底建成十项重要工程。这十项工程包括：大石桥镁砖厂第一号回转窑，东鞍山选矿厂过滤车间，轧钢厂六台预热锅炉，炼钢厂两台重型吊车，弓长岭选矿厂选矿系统，以及两台发电机、瓦斯管道、冷却塔等等。全公司9月份的建设计划，提前三天超额5％完成。
    鞍钢建设大军在9月初的誓师大会上提出向建国十周年献礼的保证以后，轰轰烈烈地展开了快速施工竞赛。大石桥镁砖厂第一号回转窑工程，原计划9月底完成，职工们经过讨论，把完工日期压缩到9月25日。在施工中，工人们推行整体系装和流水作业法等先进经验，结果在9月17日就竣工了，27日就开始点窑生产。
    这十项重要工程提前建成和投入生产，解决了鞍钢当前生产上某些原料供不应求、动力设施不足的生产关键，为鞍钢超额完成第四季度和全年钢铁生产跃进计划创造了条件。
    据新华社沈阳27日电　在新开发的沈北煤田上，又有两对机械化矿井提前正式移交生产。这两对矿井是沈北煤矿所属的清水台二号和三号斜井，每座的年产能力是二十一万吨。今年内它们将为国家增产八万吨煤炭。
    沈北煤田在沈阳以北。它是1958年大跃进中煤炭地质勘探人员发挥敢想敢干精神，打破日本人的“沈北平原无煤”的谬论，而发现的大煤田。继清水台二、三号斜井投入生产后，另外两对矿井——前屯二号和三号也在加快建设步伐，不久就要建成。
