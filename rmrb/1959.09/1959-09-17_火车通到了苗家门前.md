    Early morning in the Miao Mountains, a light mist hangs in the air. The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway winds around the mountainside like a silk ribbon, faintly visible in the clouds. On the Kuli Jing Great Panshan Road, more than 1,000 meters above sea level, several roars of "Rumble" can be heard. The train from Guangxi to Guiyang passes through five tunnels in a row, crosses deep ravines, and rushes to a village in the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture – Gutong Station. After the train entered the station, a group of Miao youths hopped and skipped onto the platform. Some came to greet relatives, others to see off friends and relatives. They cheerfully hummed mountain songs:

    A dragon emerges from the mountains,
    Flying through the clouds as swift as the wind,
    The Miao people ride on the dragon's back,
    Flying towards our benefactor, Mao Zedong.

    Pan Yingfang, a centenarian Miao elder who had just returned from visiting relatives in Duyun City, squeezed among the young men, a smile on his wrinkled face. He gestured to people and said, "When I was young, going to Duyun meant leaving early and arriving late, a whole day's walk. Today, I took the train from Duyun back to Gutong, and I arrived before I finished three pipes of tobacco. I've lived for a hundred years, but I've never seen such a 'divine dragon'."

    "That's right, in this good era, even immortals would be amazed," the young men proudly praised the changes in their hometown and praised the train for bringing happiness to the Miao people. Until evening, in the courtyard of the Gutong Home for the Elderly, a group of old people gathered around Pan Yingfang, who had just returned by train, chatting and laughing.

    For many years, the Miao people of Gutong placed their hopes on "gods" or "dragons" to change the closed state of the mountainous area, but hope remained only hope. In the years when reactionary rulers ruled the Miao Mountains, the Miao people suffered all kinds of pain in order to build roads. Under the pretext of road construction, the Kuomintang reactionaries extorted a large amount of road construction fees from the Miao people and embezzled them, and then arrested laborers and forced them to build roads. Meng Wang, a Miao woman from Madaobian Village, was forced to participate in road construction with one child and another in her womb. She fainted from overwork, and the foreman scolded her for being lazy and ended three lives with a single blow. Like this, the road was not built, but no one knows how many people died at the hands of the Kuomintang reactionary government.

    Last year, when the rails were laid to the foot of Aoyu Mountain, people said with emotion: "Chairman Mao's 'divine dragon' has realized the wishes of our ancestors. If those unfortunate people were alive now, how comfortable would they be to see the train passing through their doorsteps."

    They will never forget that the train arrived in Gutong on October 1 last year. Although it was drizzling that day, the platform was still crowded with people. Amidst the sounds of Lusheng songs and firecrackers, people cheered that Chairman Mao's "divine dragon" had arrived at the Miao village. Wen Caixue, a seventy-nine-year-old Miao poor peasant, touched the train with tears in his eyes and said: If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could we have today!

    Today, in the short span of only one year since Gutong opened to traffic, its appearance has undergone tremendous changes. On both sides of the railway, where there was originally no one, factory buildings have been built one after another – agricultural machinery factories, man-made fiber factories, substitute wineries... sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Tractors have also entered the remote areas. The rough road leading to Kaili, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, has been built into a wide avenue. Directly opposite the railway station is the newly built bus station. Nearby, the two-story Gutong Hotel is also nearing completion. The remote mountain village has become a prosperous market town, and units such as the State Commercial Bureau, Forestry Bureau, and Grain Bureau have set up transshipment stations here. At present, the station here is busy with traffic all day long, and batches of mountain goods such as wood, cassia bark, and galangal are transported out, supplying the needs of both inside and outside the province. From March to July this year alone, the train transported more than 19,000 cubic meters of logs to Guiyang. A large number of goods needed in rural areas are constantly being transported in from other places. Gutong's flue-cured tobacco is famous in Guizhou. In the past, the coal for baking tobacco leaves relied entirely on people carrying it, crossing mountains and ridges. Even a strong man could only carry more than 120 kilograms a day, which increased a lot of difficulties for production. This year, the train transported 280,000 kilograms of coal at once, which was delivered near the baking room, ensuring timely baking and saving a large amount of transportation costs.

    The rural fair held every ten days makes the village of Gutong even busier. At the local specialty purchasing station, Miao farmers transported baskets of precious medicinal materials such as galangal, and things that were originally moldy in the deep mountains became living treasures. In the first half of the year, Gutong Commune increased its income by more than 429,000 yuan from the sale of galangal alone. The income from palm pieces and cassia twigs is even greater. The supply and marketing cooperative is even more crowded. A large batch of Shanghai khaki cloth and Guangzhou rubber shoes, which are loved by young people, have immediately become popular goods of the time. The credit department of the People's Commune is also lively, with farmers participating in savings coming and going. This year, 167 Miao families in Xinzhai, Tuanpo, Gu? and other villages in Gutong Commune alone have an average deposit of more than 15 yuan per household, and some families have deposits of up to more than 160 yuan. Wang Xingwei, secretary of the Party branch of the First Production Brigade, told me: After the autumn harvest, it is estimated that the members' deposit books will have a large sum added to them.

    Gutong, the phenomenon of poverty and backwardness is gone forever. Now, the Miao farmers here can see the People's Daily every day. They actively study the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao and learn the advanced production technology of the Han people. Next to the railway station, teams of elementary school students often face the locomotives and listen with relish to the teachers explaining the power of the steam engine. The Miao girls, who are good at singing and dancing, sing louder and dance more happily. They sing praises of the changes in their hometown and praise the beautiful life and love. Every evening, people often hear such mountain songs:

    With Chairman Mao in China,
    The suffering Miao people breathe a sigh of relief,
    Grass huts have been replaced by brick and tile houses,
    The commune has installed radios;
    Today we travel by train,
    We plow the fields with tractors;
    The railway connects thousands of miles,
    Beijing and Gutong are tightly connected;
    Strive to be a model,
    Thank Chairman Mao in person.

    火车通到了苗家门前
    本报记者　柳青　徐张
    早晨，苗岭山区薄雾蒙蒙。黔桂铁路绕过山腰，像一条锦带，隐映在云雾中。在拔海一千多公尺的苦李井大盘道上，传出了几阵“隆隆”的吼声，从广西开往贵阳的列车，连续钻过五个隧道，越过深涧，奔到了黔东南苗族侗族自治州的一个村寨——谷硐车站。火车进站后，一群苗族青年蹦蹦跳跳地走进月台。有的来迎接亲人，有的来送戚友上车。他们愉快地哼着山歌：
    山里钻出一条龙，
    腾云驾雾快如风，
    苗家骑在龙背上，
    飞向恩人毛泽东。
    刚从都匀市探亲回来的苗族百岁老人潘应芳，挤在小伙子们中间，满布皱纹的脸上流露着笑意，他比划着对人说：“我年轻时下都匀，起早摸黑要走一整天，今天从都匀坐火车回谷硐，三袋烟还没有吸完就到了。我长百岁，可没有见过这样的‘神龙’。”
    “是罗，碰上这个好世道，神仙下凡也要看花眼睛。”小伙子们骄傲地赞扬着自己家乡的变化，赞美火车给苗家带来了幸福。直到晚上，在谷硐敬老院的院子里，一群老人还围着刚坐火车归来的潘应芳谈笑。
    多少年来，谷硐的苗族人民为了改变山区的闭塞状态，他们把希望寄托于“神”或“龙”，可是希望一直只是希望而已。在反动统治者统治着苗岭山的年代里，为了修路，苗族人民历尽了各种痛苦。国民党反动派借修路为名，向苗族人民勒索了大批修路费贪污了，然后又抓捕民工强迫他们修路。马道边村的苗族妇女蒙王氏，带着一个孩子，肚子里还怀着一个孩子，也被迫去参加修路。她因为劳累过度而昏倒了，工头还骂她偷懒，顺手一棒，就结束了三条生命。像这样，公路没有修成，却不知多少人死在国民党反动政府的手里。
    去年，当钢轨铺到鳌鱼山下时，人们感慨万端地说：“毛主席的‘神龙’使我们祖祖辈辈的愿望实现了。要是那些苦命人活到现在，看见火车通过家门口，该多安逸。”
    他们谁都不会忘记，去年10月1日火车通到了谷硐。那天尽管下着细雨，月台上仍然挤满了人。在籚笙歌声和鞭炮声中，人们欢呼毛主席的“神龙”到了苗家寨子。七十九岁的苗族贫农文才学摸着火车，热泪盈眶地说：不是共产党和毛主席，我们怎么能有今天！
    今天，在谷硐通车仅一年的短短时间里，它的面貌发生了巨大的变化。铁路两旁，原先是荒无人烟的地方，现在盖起了一幢幢的厂房——农业机械厂、人造棉厂、代用品酒厂……像雨后春笋一般接二连三地投入生产。拖拉机也开进了穷乡僻壤。通往自治州首府——凯里的毛坯公路，已修成康庄大道。与火车站遥遥相对是新修建起来的汽车站，在它的近旁，两层楼房的谷硐大饭店也快完工了。偏僻的山村，变成了繁荣的集镇，州商业局、林业局、粮食局等单位，在这里设立了转运站。目前，这里的车站上，整天车水马龙，成批的木材、桂皮、黄姜等山货源源外运，供应省内外的需要。只是今年3月到7月，火车运到贵阳的原木就有一万九千多立方米。大量农村需要的货物，又从外地不断地运进来。谷硐的烤烟在贵州是享有盛名的，过去烘烤烟叶的煤全靠人挑，翻山越岭，硬汉子一天也只能挑一百二十多斤，给生产增加了很多困难。今年火车一下就拖了二十八万斤煤，送到烤房附近，保证了及时烘烤，节省了大批运费。
    每隔十天一次的乡场，使谷硐这个村寨更显得繁忙了。在土特产收购站里，苗族农民将采集的黄姜等名贵药材，一筐筐的运来，原来霉烂在深山里的东西变成活宝了。谷硐公社上半年仅卖出黄姜一项就增加四十二万九千多元的收入。加上棕片、桂枝等的收入就更多了。供销社里，人群更是熙熙攘攘，刚到的大批上海卡叽布和青年们喜爱的广州胶鞋等日用品，马上成了应时热货。在人民公社的信用部里，也是闹腾腾的，参加储蓄的农民人来人往。今年，只谷硐公社的新寨、团坡、谷?等寨的一百六十七户苗族，每户平均存款十五元多，有的人家存款高达一百六十多元。第一生产大队党支部书记王兴伟同志告诉我说：秋收后，社员们的存折上估计还要添上一大笔。
    谷硐，穷困落后的现象一去不复返了。现在，这里的苗族农民，每天都可以看到人民日报，他们积极的学习党和毛主席的指示，学习汉族人民的先进生产技术；在火车站旁，成队的小学生常常对着机车，津津有味地听着老师给他们讲解蒸汽机的威力。能歌善舞的苗族姑娘们，歌声唱得更响，舞跳得更欢。她们歌颂家乡的变化，歌颂美好的生活和爱情。每天傍晚，人们经常听见这样的山歌声：
    中国有了毛主席，
    苦难的苗家吐了气，
    草屋换成砖瓦房子，
    公社装起收音机；
    今天走路坐火车，
    耕田开着拖拉机；
    铁路千里连成线，
    北京谷硐连得紧紧的；
    展劲争取当模范，
    亲口谢谢毛主席。
