	Guizhou's First Pair of Mechanized Coal Mines Put into Production
	Guizhou Province's first pair of mechanized coal mining wells – the newly built inclined shaft of the Guiyang Coal Mine – was completed and put into production on September 1st after a year and two months of intense construction.

	The Guiyang Coal Mine's new inclined shaft has an annual production capacity of 210,000 tons of raw coal, and all operations from ventilation, drainage, mining, lifting to transportation are mechanized.

	Rice Grows on the Pamir Plateau
	The 7.5 mu of rice first planted this year in Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County, Xinjiang, is growing well. The 5.5 mu of rice in the Huotong and Ban'er Communes on the east and south banks of the Tashkurgan River has grown to over 60 centimeters in height and has begun to fill with grain. The 2 mu of rice in the Mushtag Commune at the foot of Mushtag Ata has also begun to head.

	Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County is located in the eastern part of the Pamir Plateau, full of towering mountains and short frost-free periods. Rice had never been tried before. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, under the leadership of the Party, people have liberated their thinking and boldly tried planting rice this year.

	Rice Trial in Mohe
	Mohe is the northernmost remote region of our country, with a cold climate (annual average temperature of minus 5.2 degrees Celsius) and short frost-free periods. In the more than 40 years since crops began to be planted locally, only wheat, potatoes, and other crops have been planted; rice has never been planted.

	This year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Heihe Agricultural Research Institute began trial planting rice here. All three varieties tested have headed and flowered. Among them, Nonglin No. 11 matured earliest, started filling in early August, and is now in the waxy ripe stage. The heavy ears of rice have aroused great interest among the people of Mohe.

    贵州第一对机械化  采煤矿井投入生产
    贵州省第一对机械化采煤的矿井——贵阳煤矿新建斜井，经过一年又两个月的紧张施工，在9月1日建成并投入生产。
    贵阳煤矿新建斜井能年产原煤二十一万吨，从通风、排水、采掘、提升直到运输，全部采用机械化操作。
    水稻上了帕米尔高原
    新疆塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县今年首次试种的七亩五分水稻，生长良好。塔什库尔干河东岸和南岸的伙同、班的尔两公社的五亩半水稻，已长高六十厘米以上，开始灌浆结粒。慕士塔格山脚下慕士塔格公社的两亩水稻，也开始抽穗。
    塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县位于帕米尔高原东部，到处是崇山峻岭，无霜期很短，过去没有试种过水稻，自从去年大跃进以来，在党的领导下，人们解放思想，今年大胆地试种了水稻。
    漠河试种水稻
    漠河是我国的最北部的边远地区，气候寒冷（年平均温度为摄氏零下五点二度）、无霜期短，当地开始种植作物以来四十多年的历史，只种植麦类、马铃薯等作物，从没种过水稻。
    今年黑龙江省黑河农业研究所开始在这里试种水稻。试种的三个品种已全部抽穗，开花，其中农林十一号成熟最早，8月上旬灌浆，现在已到腊熟期。沉甸甸的稻穗引起了漠河人民极大兴趣。
