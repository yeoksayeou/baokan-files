A Good Negative Example
Seeing the U.S. Imperialists' Hatred of Our Great Achievements from the U.S. Information Service's Shameless Slander of Our Great Leap Forward

(Dispatch from our newspaper) The United States Information Service, the propaganda machine of the U.S. government, issued a commentary from Washington on the 2nd, attempting to slander and defame the spirit of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP. The full text of this commentary is published below:

U.S. Information Service, Washington, 2nd: On August 26th, two of the most startling documents to date from Communist China were published. These are the Communique and the Party Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting was reportedly held from August 2nd to 16th, 1959, in Lushan, Jiangxi.

The communique admits to inappropriate planning, statistical errors, and shortcomings in the economy, and makes large-scale reductions to the 1959 plan. Such a comprehensive admission of major errors by the highest authorities is unique in the history of the Chinese Communist regime.

As recently as April 1959, the propaganda apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party, together with the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, declared that the Chinese Communist Party's economy had achieved "great victories" in a "Great Leap Forward" in 1958.

At that time, Premier Zhou Enlai, citing the latest figures published by the State Statistical Bureau, confirmed the announced absurd figures for 1958 and announced the targets for 1959.

For observers studying the situation in the Chinese Communist Party, the announced figures for economic growth were clearly greatly exaggerated; it was equally obvious that the 1959 targets could not be met.

In December 1958, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party apparently also noticed the difficulties facing the plan. Since 1959, it has become more aware of the seriousness of these difficulties.

The leadership then gave in to the need to ease working conditions and personal controls in the grumbling communes. The backyard iron furnace system was also discontinued because it was "impractical." This system was a frequently discussed feature in the so-called "Great Leap Forward" steel production figures.

Hints also began to appear in propaganda suggesting that leaders are not necessarily infallible, and that even Mao Zedong himself sometimes makes mistakes that people make.

Then, shortly after the severe floods in early summer, all the senior leaders of Communist China disappeared from public view. Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other party leaders were not seen in June and remained absent until last week.

It seems reasonable to assume that this secret meeting or series of meetings was specifically to study the domestic difficulties troubling Communist China. The length of the meeting and the remarkable silence maintained by Beijing seem to indicate serious difficulties within the highest ruling group itself in reaching a consensus on the entire concept of the "Great Leap Forward."

Another indication that the participants in this meeting failed to reach a consensus is the fact that while the Eighth Plenary Session was in progress, the official Beijing People's Daily published two editorials on "Right-leaning Conservatism" on August 6th and 7th.

These two editorials – the first documents involving policy issues published since June – were inconclusive. On the one hand, they complained that right-leaning conservatives were adopting a defeatist attitude toward high production targets. On the other hand, they quoted Mao Zedong as saying, "One cannot plan one's actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and one should not force oneself to do things that are really impossible."

Something went wrong; this is not the wording commonly used in official editorials, which in Communist China are equivalent to orders. The regime is in trouble and is desperately seeking some way to resolve this situation as soon as possible in order to present a more decent face to the world before celebrating the tenth anniversary of the National Day on October 1st.

Then, on August 26th, the Communique and Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session were published. The communique stated: "According to the verified figures of the national economic statistics of last year by the State Statistical Bureau... the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee re-examined this year's national economic plan and considered that the original targets of this plan were somewhat high and needed to be appropriately adjusted."

"After repeated verification in the first half of this year, the statistics of agricultural product output published in the past for 1958 were too high... Due to the lack of appropriate labor arrangements for the autumn harvest, the work of harvesting and collection was somewhat rough."

The communique went on to explain what was meant by "too high." It was cited that the new statistical figure for grain production in 1958 was 250 million tons, a reduction of 65% from the originally announced 375 million tons.

The revised steel production for 1958 was 8 million tons (it was announced that the 3.08 million tons of steel smelted in backyard furnaces was not suitable for industrial use). The original announcement was 11 million tons.

Cotton production in 1958 is now announced as 2.1 million tons, instead of the originally announced 3.32 million tons.

Coal production is said to remain at 270 million tons, 30 million tons short of the production target.

Although these reduced figures are still impressive, there is no reason to believe that these figures are more reliable than the originally announced figures. To be sure, the "verified" 1958 production figures are still inconsistent with the known serious food shortages and lack of consumer goods.

One thing is clear, and that is that the mistakes made by the regime are so serious that it was forced to publish this new statistical figure in order to avoid being seen as being so far removed from reality, thus undermining future trust at home and abroad.

The reduction of these basic commodity targets for 1959 further proves that the Chinese Communist economy is in trouble.

The new targets are: steel – reduced from 18 million tons to 12 million tons; coal – reduced from 380 million tons to 335 million tons; grain – reduced from 525 million tons to 275 million tons; cotton – reduced from 5 million tons to 2.31 million tons.

While these revised figures are undoubtedly more realistic than the original figures, they are still a long way from being achieved. It is likely that these figures will be further reduced sometime after the foreign guests attending the October 1st National Day celebrations have definitely left Communist China.

Another aspect of these documents is that the Party's policy towards Party members at all levels has become tougher. The communique pointed out, "For the continued leap forward this year, the main danger at present is the growth of right-leaning opportunist thinking among some cadres. They do not try their best to complete the tasks that could have been completed according to objective conditions and subjective efforts. They underestimate the great achievements of the working people in the Great Leap Forward movement and the people's commune movement, while overestimating the shortcomings of these two movements due to lack of experience..."

The communique continued, "This is completely wrong." The plenary session demanded that Party committees at all levels "resolutely criticize and overcome the erroneous thinking of this right-leaning opportunism among some cadres, adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, go all out, and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward plan."

If it appears that the disciplinary laxity that has occurred within the Chinese Communist Party has reached a very serious level, then a large-scale rectification movement against "rightists" has now been prepared.

There is reason to believe that this movement has in fact begun. The scale of the movement and at which levels of the Party the movement will be carried out cannot be determined. However, it is certain that the people of mainland China will be the biggest victims of the regime's frantic efforts to make up for the losses caused by its errors in planning and implementing the "Great Leap Forward."

The pressure exerted on the Chinese masses in 1958 reached what seemed to be the maximum level. Now the regime is demanding that they work even harder, or be labeled as "right-leaning," which, according to dialectics, is a serious crime, subject to criticism and self-criticism, personal persecution, and possibly "labor reform."

However, all of this should not be interpreted as evidence that the Chinese Communist Party's economy has failed or may collapse due to admitting errors in planning and using wasteful production methods.

By making inhumane demands on its people, the regime was able to make some progress in some selected areas of its economy last year, although it did not reach the figures it first claimed, and the revised figures are not necessarily true.

Clearly, the regime is determined to make its people make greater sacrifices in order to increase the production of basic commodities this year.

It still has the largest standing army in the Far East and the world's largest Communist Party, not to mention the largest population.

With these manpower and control mechanisms, the regime can undoubtedly make some progress at a great human cost, even by relying on "putting politics in command" (rather than normal economic considerations).

However, those countries that are eager to make rapid economic progress and expect that Communist China may provide a proven way to achieve such progress should be disillusioned with communism's ability to provide an easy solution to the problem of rapid industrialization.

    一个很好的反面教材
    从美国新闻处对我国大跃进的无耻诽谤  看美帝国主义者对我国伟大成就的仇视
    本报讯　美国政府的宣传机器美国新闻处于2日从华盛顿发出一则述评，竭力污蔑和诽谤中共八届八中全会的公报和决议的精神。现将这个述评的全文发表如下：
    美国新闻处华盛顿2日电　8月26日，到目前为止来自共产党中国的两个最惊人的文件发表了。这就是中国共产党第八届中央委员会第八次全体会议的公报和党的决议。会议据说是从1959年8月2日至16日在江西庐山召开的。
    公报承认计划工作不适当、统计有错误、经济中存在着缺点，并且对1959年计划作了大规模的削减。这样一种最高当局全面承认犯了重大错误的行动在中国共产党政权的历史上是独一无二的。
    近在1959年4月，中国共产党的宣传机构同第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议一道，宣称中国共产党的经济在1958年在一次“大跃进”中获得了“巨大胜利”。
    当时，周恩来总理引用国家统计局最新发表的数字，确认了已宣布的1958年的荒诞的数字，并且宣布了1959年的指标。
    对研究中国共产党情况的观察家们来说，所宣布的经济增长数字显然是大大夸大的；1959年的指标不可能完成也是同样明显的。
    1958年12月，中国共产党的领导方面显然也注意到这个计划所面临的困难。1959年以来，它更了解到这些困难的严重性。
    领导方面接着迫于需要作出了让步，缓和了喃喃抱怨的公社中的工作条件和对个人的控制。后院炼铁炉的制度也因为“不实用”而不继续下去了。这种制度在所说的“大跃进”的钢铁增产数字方面曾经是一个经常被谈论的特点。
    在宣传里也开始透露出一些暗示，暗示领导人不一定不犯错误，甚至毛泽东本人有时也要犯人们会犯的错误。
    然后，在初夏的大水灾之后不久，共产党中国的全体高级领导人在公共的场合就都看不到了。毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德以及其他党的领导人在6月间就看不到了，在上星期以前，他们一直是销声匿迹。
    似乎有理由设想这次的秘密会议或一系列的会议专门为的是研究使共产党中国烦恼的国内困难问题。会议时间很长，而且北平保持引人注目的沉默，似乎表明在最高统治集团本身内部在对“大跃进”这一整个概念取得一致意见方面存在着严重的困难。
    表明这次会议的参加者没有能取得一致意见的又一迹象是：当八中全会正在进行时，官方北平人民日报在8月6、7两日发表的两篇关于“右倾保守主义”的社论。
    这两篇社论——自从6月以来第一次发表的牵涉到政策问题的文件——是未作定论的。一方面，它们埋怨右倾保守主义分子对高的生产指标抱着一种失败主义的态度。另一方面，它们又引用毛泽东的话说，“一个人不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。”
    是出了什么毛病；这不是正式社论所常用的措辞，在共产党中国，正式社论等于是一纸命令。那个政权遇到了麻烦，并且正在狼狈地寻求早日解决这一局面的某种办法，以便在庆祝十·一国庆十周年之前摆出一副比较端正的面貌来给全世界看。
    接着，在8月26日发表了八中全会的公报和决议。公报说：“根据国家统计局对去年国民经济统计的核实数字：……八届八中全会重新审查了今年的国民经济计划，认为这个计划的原定指标有些偏高，需要加以适当的调整。
    “经过今年上半年再三核实，过去发表的1958年的农业产品产量的统计偏高……由于对秋季大丰收缺乏适当的劳动力安排，割打收藏的工作进行得有些粗糙。”
    公报接着说明了“偏高”的意思是什么。据举出，1958年谷物产量的新统计数字是二亿五千万吨，比原来宣布的三亿七千五百万吨减少为65％。
    修正后的1958年钢产量是八百万吨（据宣布，后院炼钢炉所炼出来的三百零八万吨钢是不合于工业使用的）。原来宣布的是一千一百万吨。
    据现在宣布，1958年的棉花产量是二百一十万吨，而不是原来宣布的三百三十二万吨。
    据说煤产量仍然是二亿七千万吨，比生产指标数字少了三千万吨。
    虽然降低以后的这些数字仍然是给人深刻印象的，但是没有理由认为这些数字比原来宣布的数字可靠。肯定说，“经过核实的”1958年的生产数字同人们知道的严重缺粮和缺少消费品的情况仍然是不一致的。
    有一件事很清楚，那就是这个政权所犯的错误是如此之严重，以致于它被迫发表这张新的统计数字单，以免被人们看穿同现实差的那么远，因而破坏将来在国内外的信任。
    1959年这些基本商品指标的降低进一步证明中国共产党经济遇到麻烦。
    新指标是：钢——从一千八百万吨降低到一千二百万吨；煤——从三亿八千万吨降低到三亿三千五百万吨；粮食——从五亿二千五百万吨降低到二亿七千五百万吨；棉花——从五百万吨降低到二百三十一万吨。
    虽然这些经过修改的数字毫无疑问地比原来的数字要现实一些，但是他们离实现仍然有很长距离。情况很可能是这样，在参加十月一日国庆庆祝典礼的外国客人们肯定地离开共产党中国以后某个时候，这些数字还要降低。
    这些文件的另一个方面是，党对党内各级人员的方针变得强硬了。公报指出，“对于实现今年的继续跃进来说，当前的主要危险是在某些干部中滋长着右倾机会主义的思想。他们对于那些根据客观条件和主观努力本来可以完成的任务，不去千方百计地努力完成。他们对于劳动人民在大跃进运动和人民公社运动中所取得的伟大成绩估计过低，而对于这两个运动中由于经验不足而产生的若干缺点则估计过于严重……”。
    公报继续说，“这完全是错误的”。全会要求各级党委“坚决批判和克服某些干部中的这种右倾机会主义的错误思想，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，鼓足干劲，努力完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划”。
    如果看来在中国共产党内已经发生的纪律上的松弛现象达到十分严重的程度的话，那末一次针对“右派分子”的大规模的整风运动现在已经作好准备了。
    人们有理由认为，事实上这次运动已经开始。运动的规模和这次运动将在党的哪几级内开展尚不能肯定。然而，大陆中国的老百姓将是这个政权为了弥补它在计划工作和执行“大跃进”方面产生的错误所造成的损失而作的疯狂努力的最大受害者，这一点是可以肯定的。
    1958年对中国人民大众施加的压力达到了看来是最大的程度。现在这个政权要求他们更努力地工作，不然就被划为“右倾分子”，按照辩证法，“右倾分子”是一种严重的罪过，要受到批评与自我批评，受到人身迫害，很可能还要“劳动改造”。
    但是，不应当把所有这一切解释成一种证据，证明由于承认在计划工作方面发生错误和利用浪费的生产方法，中国共产党的经济失败了，或者可能崩溃。
    由于对它的人民提出不人道的要求，这个政权去年能够在它的经济的经过挑选出来的一些方面取得某些进展，虽然它第一次宣称取得的数字完全没有达到，经过修改的数字也不一定是真的。
    显然，这个政权决心要它的人民作出更大的牺牲，以便在今年增加基本商品的生产。
    它仍然拥有远东最大的常备军和世界上最大的共产党，更不用说最多的人口了。
  有着这些人力和控制机构，这个政权无疑可以以巨大的人的代价，甚至靠“政治挂帅”（而不是正常的经济考虑）取得某些进展。
  然而那些急于要迅速在经济上取得进展，并且指望共产党中国或许会提供一种经过证明的取得这种进展的办法的国家，对共产主义为迅速实现工业化的问题提供容易的解决办法的能力所抱的希望应当幻灭了。
