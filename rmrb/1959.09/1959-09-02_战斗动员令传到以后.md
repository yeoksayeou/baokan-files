After We Received the Combat Mobilization Order

　　We Completed the August Production Task Ahead of Schedule

　　We, the workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, were very excited after hearing the resolutions and communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. We were determined to respond to the Party's call with practical actions, and immediately launched a vigorous technical performance competition and rivalry in production. At 8:00 AM on August 29, the workers victoriously completed the August steel production plan two days and sixteen hours ahead of schedule. The output increased by 7.2% compared with the previous month; the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 99%, an increase of 0.92% compared with the previous month; and the smelting time per furnace of steel was shortened by eleven minutes compared with the previous month.

　　The workers were even more enthusiastic in carrying out the technical performance rivalry. The rivalry between Liang Chengzhe's and Wang Kuishan's groups was the most intense. They competed and learned from each other. The two groups created eight new smelting records, and the average smelting time was shortened by more than 30 minutes compared with the plan.

　　Encouraged by the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and on the basis of the victory of comprehensively and over fulfilling the August production tasks, all our employees have now put forward new combat slogans and are preparing to immediately join the battle! 　Pang Rufan

　　Breaking Through Production Quotas One After Another

　　The employees of our Beijing Joint State-Private Copper Wire Factory wholeheartedly read the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the resolution on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Everyone unanimously expressed their support and determination to resolutely implement them in future work.

　　Our factory specializes in producing various wires and contracting the processing of non-ferrous metal wires for motors and instruments. During the Great Leap Forward last year, we were already able to process copper wires as thin as hair and various transformer wires. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and the soaring enthusiasm of the workers, our factory's production capacity has increased fourfold compared with 1957, and we have gloriously won the title of Beijing Red Flag Factory.

　　On August 6, we studied the People's Daily editorial on "Opposing Right-leaning Thought and Launching a Campaign to Increase Production and Practice Economy," and a new leap forward situation quickly emerged in the factory. For example, regarding the problem of insufficient raw materials, the workers proposed to modify the copper smelting blast equipment, so that the daily output of copper smelting increased from the original three tons to six tons eight. At the same time, through the active efforts of the marketing staff to contact other cities, the problem of raw material shortage has improved. Once the masses were mobilized, production quotas were broken through one after another. On August 19, the daily output of the whole factory was 4,810 kilograms, and on August 21 it increased to 7,900 kilograms. On August 27, after the employees excitedly discussed the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, declarations, challenges, and big-character posters were continuously posted in the workshop. We are determined to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, go all out, race against time, and greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day by over fulfilling the third quarter plan.

　　Communalization Has Brought a Happy Life

　　On the evening of August 26, more than 10,000 members of our commune collectively listened to the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the resolution on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. When we heard from the broadcast that our country would catch up with the United Kingdom in about ten years, complete the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and greatly over fulfill the Twelve-Year Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, everyone was excited and enthusiastic. In order to respond to the Party's call with practical actions, they expressed their determination to contribute their own strength to the realization of various plans. On that night, more than 10,000 commune members fought overnight until after 12 o'clock, pressing 4.45 million catties of green manure. It was late at night and drizzling, but people were still reluctant to leave. On the morning of the 27th, the commune members went to the fields earlier than any other day, and the number of work attendance also increased. The Fantuozi Management Area originally planned to finish the second weeding of more than 1,000 mu of autumn vegetables by September 5, but now it plans to finish all of it within two days. The number of commune members participating in weeding vegetables has increased from more than 200 in the past to more than 400.

　　Our commune has been established for less than a year now, but it has already shown great superiority. Because the commune has more people and greater strength, we have realized water conservancy after only one winter and one spring, built 31 reservoirs, 7 dams across rivers, dug 135 deep wells, and dug 187 drainage ditches. This year, although there has been more rain than in previous years, our area, which suffers from floods nine years out of ten, has achieved a bumper harvest.

　　Before the communalization, we looked forward to tractors every day, but we couldn't afford them. After the communalization, our commune bought 13 tractors and 5 cars at once. The commune members were very happy to see the tractors plowing the land with their own eyes. After the communalization, we also established four small power stations, and more than 4,000 commune members turned on electric lights. After the communalization, our cultural life has become more active than in the past, with clubs, libraries, and radio stations in every team.

　　Guaranteeing the Supply of 5 Million Catties of Vegetables to the Capital for National Day

　　On the evening of the 26th, after we listened to the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, all the commune members were very excited and unanimously responded to the Party's call. On the morning of the 27th, we discussed and revised the original vegetable production targets.

　　The original autumn sowing plan for vegetables in the Sijiqing Commune was 24,450 mu. Now, on the basis of guaranteeing the over fulfillment, it was decided to expand the improved yangqi (simple greenhouse) from the existing 100 or so to more than 5,000, so as to increase the planting area of winter vegetables and produce more vegetables to ensure the supply of 150.07 million catties of fresh vegetables to the Beijing market from October this year to March next year, including 700,000 catties of fine vegetables such as eggplants, broad beans, snow cabbage, cucumbers and chives grown in improved yangqi and greenhouses. In addition to guaranteeing the supply of 5 million catties of vegetables to the Beijing market around National Day, we will plant another season of early-maturing vegetables. We will make preparations for winter vegetables as soon as possible, on the one hand, over fulfilling the planting of autumn vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and radishes; on the other hand, cultivating a large number of seedlings of fine vegetables such as green peppers and eggplants.

　　In the next few months, in addition to strengthening the management of autumn fields, we will also learn from advanced experience in planting vegetables at home and abroad to ensure a bumper harvest of vegetables and welcome the great 10th anniversary of National Day.

　　The New Enthusiasm of Old Commune Members

　　At 5:00 AM on the morning of the 27th, when the sky was still dimly lit, Zuo Jishou, the Party Branch Secretary of the Dongfang Brigade of the Jiangxiang Commune in Nanchang County, set off to Zhangdian Production Team for a meeting. When he was about to arrive at the Zhangdian Production Team, Zuo Jishou suddenly saw a person with a bamboo hat on his head, with clothes in the hat, swimming across the river. Zuo Jishou felt strange, who would be swimming across the river so early? He ran to the river bank, only to see that the person swimming was Liu Houcai, an old commune member who was 68 years old. He couldn't help but ask, "Why are you swimming across the river so early?" Liu Houcai said to Zuo Jishou, "The Party Central Committee calls for a big effort in September, so we have to hurry up!" The reason for swimming across the river was this: There is a river in front of Zhangdian Village, and Liu Houcai is responsible for the rice fields on the other side of the river; there is a bridge on the river, which is half a mile away from the village. It takes half an hour to walk from the village to the bridge and then to the fields. If you swim directly across the river to the fields, it only takes ten minutes. Liu Houcai swam across the river to save the twenty minutes spent walking across the bridge, and to get to the fields early to weed the rice. After Liu Houcai finished speaking, he walked towards the fields, rolled up his trouser legs and started weeding the rice. Half an hour later, his son, daughter-in-law, and more than ten commune members came to the fields and were moved to see that Liu Houcai had already weeded a large area of the field. They said, "Old commune members are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and going all out to engage in production. We must learn from him!"

　　This is how it happened: After listening to the broadcast of the communique and resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC on the evening of the 26th, the production brigade held a commune member meeting. Many people spoke at the meeting and expressed their determination. At that time, the old commune member wanted to go on stage to express his feelings, but he was afraid that the commune members would say that he "has such a long white beard, you should rest at home," so he didn't go on stage until the end of the meeting. He said: "I am almost seventy years old, and my enthusiasm will break through the sky! In the great battle of September, I will do three hundred points (work points) in one month!" There was a burst of warm applause from the audience...
                                Liu Guanghui

　　Rehearsing "Mu Guiying Takes Command"

　　After the communique and resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were transmitted to our China Peking Opera House, it immediately set off a new upsurge of enthusiastic practice and rehearsal in the entire hospital.

　　In order to truly race against time, we have redeployed the rehearsal plan. "Mu Guiying Takes Command," starring President Mei Lanfang, was originally scheduled to be re-arranged and processed in September, but now it has been officially opened for rehearsal on August 29 ahead of schedule. Famous actors Li Shaochun, Yuan Shihai, Li Hezeng, and Li Jinquan, who have recently joined the play as assistant performers, have begun intensive preparations such as reading the script, matching lines, and creating arias. While participating in the rehearsal of "Mu Guiying Takes Command," the First Troupe decided to interweave the careful polishing of tribute dramas such as "Wild Boar Forest," "Battle of Chibi," and "White-Haired Girl" in order to further achieve: delicate performance, clear rhythm, prominent characters, and complete style.

　　Currently, the Third Troupe, which is touring Anyang, Henan, created two street dramas while composing and rehearsing them overnight after hearing the broadcast of the communique and resolution, and performed them for the local people the next day.

　　Encouraged by the continued leap forward, a new collaboration is unfolding between the groups in the entire hospital. In addition to strengthening the lineup of "Mu Guiying Takes Command," the lineup of some tribute excerpts is also being strengthened. For example, "Zhan Zi at the辕门" performed by Li Hezeng of the Second Troupe has now been decided to be played by Yuan Shihai of the First Troupe as Jiao Zan.

    战斗动员令传到以后
    我们提前完成了八月份生产任务
    我们太原钢铁公司第一炼钢厂的工人们，在听到党的八届八中全会决议和公报后，十分兴奋，都决心以实际行动响应党的号召，并立即在生产上掀起了热火朝天的技术表演赛和对手赛。8月29日上午八时，工人们提前两天又十六小时胜利完成了8月份的产钢计划，产量比上月提高7.2％；钢锭合格率达到99％，比上月提高0.92％；每炉钢的冶炼时间比上月缩短了十一分。
    工人们在开展技术表演对手赛中，干劲更足，梁承哲和王奎山两个小组的对手赛最紧张，他们互相竞赛，互相学习，两个小组连创八次冶炼新纪录，平均冶炼时间都比计划缩短三十分钟以上。
    我们全体职工在党的八届八中全会决议精神的鼓舞下，和全面超额地完成8月份生产任务的胜利基础上，现在又提出了新的战斗口号，并准备立即投入战斗！　庞如藩
    纷纷突破生产定额
    我们北京公私合营铜丝厂的职工们全神贯注地阅读了中共八届八中全会公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议，大家一致表示拥护并在今后的工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我们的工厂是专门生产各种电线、承揽加工电机仪表中有色金属线的工厂。在去年的大跃进中，我们已能加工比头发丝还细的铜线、各种变压器用的线了。由于党的领导和工人们的冲天干劲，我们工厂的生产能力比1957年增加了四倍，光荣地获得了北京红旗工厂的称号。
    8月6日我们学习了人民日报关于“反对右倾思想，开展增产节约运动”的社论，全厂迅速出现了一个新的跃进局面。例如原料不足问题，工人提出改装化铜鼓风设备，使化铜的日产量由原来的三吨提高到了六吨八。同时经过供销人员积极到外埠联系，缺原料问题有了好转。群众一经发动起来，生产定额纷纷突破。8月19日全厂日产量是四千八百一十公斤，21日提高到了七千九百公斤。8月27日职工们兴奋地讨论了党的八届八中全会的号召后，车间里不断贴出决心书、挑战书和大字报。我们坚决响应党的八届八中全会的号召，鼓足干劲，分秒必争，以超额完成第三季度计划迎接伟大的国庆十周年。

    公社化带来了幸福生活
    8月26日晚，我们公社一万多名社员集体收听了中共八届八中全会公报和开展增产节约运动的决议，当我们从广播里听到我们的国家要在十年左右赶上英国、提前三年完成第二个五年计划、大大提前超额完成十二年农业发展纲要的喜讯以后，人人振奋，群情激昂，为了以实际行动响应党的号召，纷纷表示决心要在实现各项计划中贡献出自己的力量。当天晚上，一万多名社员连夜激战到十二点多钟，压绿肥四百四十五万斤，夜深了，细雨蒙蒙，人们还不肯离开。27日清晨，社员下地的时间比哪天都早，出勤数也增加了。泛坨子管理区一千多亩秋菜原计划要到9月5日才能铲完二遍，现在计划在两天之内全部铲完，参加铲菜的社员由过去二百多人增加到四百多人。
    我们公社成立到现在还不到一年，但是已经显示出巨大的优越性。由于公社人多力量大，我们仅仅经过一冬一春，就已经实现了水利化，修了水库三十一座，拦河坝七座，打深井一百三十五眼，挖排水沟一百八十七条。今年下雨虽然比往年多，而我们这十年九涝的地方却得到了大丰收。
    公社化以前，我们天天盼拖拉机，可就是买不起。公社化之后，我们社一下子买了十三台拖拉机、五台汽车。社员们亲眼看到拖拉机翻地，都乐得不得了。公社化之后，我们还建立四处小型发电站，四千多户社员点上了电灯。公社化以后，我们的文化生活比过去更活跃了，俱乐部、图书馆、广播站，队队都有。

    保证国庆节供应首都五百万斤蔬菜
    26日晚，我们收听了党的八届八中全会的公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议以后，全体社员非常兴奋，一致响应党的号召。在27日早上就讨论修订了原来蔬菜生产指标。
    四季青公社原来蔬菜秋播计划是二万四千四百五十亩，现在在保证超额完成的基础上，决定把改良阳畦（简易温室）从现有的一百来间扩大到五千间以上，使冬季蔬菜种植面积增大，多多生产蔬菜，保证从今年10月份开始到明年3月份供应北京市场一亿五千零七十万斤新鲜蔬菜，其中包括在改良阳畦和温室里生长的七十万斤茄子、扁豆、雪里红、黄瓜和韭菜等细菜。国庆节前后除保证供应北京市场五百万斤蔬菜外，再增种一季早熟蔬菜。及早作好冬季蔬菜准备工作，一方面超计划的播种大白菜、萝卜等秋菜；一方面大量的培育青椒、茄子等细菜的幼苗。
    在今后的几个月里，我们除了加强秋田管理外，还要学习国内外种植蔬菜的先进经验，保证蔬菜大丰收，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。

    老社员的新干劲
    27日早晨五点钟，天蒙蒙亮，南昌县蒋巷公社东方大队党支部书记左吉寿出发到张店生产队去开会。快到张店生产队时，左吉寿突然看到一个人头上顶着一个斗笠，斗笠里放着衣服，正从河的那边泅水过来。左吉寿感到奇怪，这么早，谁就泅水过河？他跑到河边，这才看清楚泅水的人原来是六十八岁的老社员刘候才。他禁不住问道：“怎么这样早泅水过河？”刘候才对左吉寿说：“党中央号召大干九月份，我们就得抓紧点干呀！”泅水过河的原因是这样：张店村前有一条河，刘候才分工负责河对岸的稻田；河上有一座桥，离村半里路，从村子到过桥再到田里要走半个小时，如果直接泅水过河到田里只要十分钟，刘候才泅水过河就是为了节省过桥走路多花的二十分钟时间，早到田里耘禾。刘候才说完了话便往田里走去，卷上裤腿就耘田。半个小时后，他的儿子、媳妇和十多个社员来到了田里，看到刘候才已经耘了一大块田，感动地说：“老社员响应党中央的号召，鼓足干劲搞生产，我们要向他学习！”
    事情是这样发生的：26日晚上听完中共八届八中全会的公报和决议的广播后，生产大队召开了社员大会，许多人在会上发了言，表示了决心。当时老社员早想上台表表心，可是又怕社员们说他“白胡子都有那样长了，你就在家里休息吧，”就一直到散会时才走上台子说话。他说：“我年到七十边，我干劲要冲破天！大战九月份，我一月要做三百分（工分）！”台下一阵热烈掌声……

    重新排练“穆桂英挂帅”
    党的八届八中全会的公报和决议传到我们中国京剧院后，立刻在全院掀起了一个热烈的练功、排演的新高潮。
    为了切实作到分秒必争，我们重新部署了排演计划。以梅兰芳院长为主演出的“穆桂英挂帅”，原定于9月内重排加工，现在已经提前在8月29日正式开排。新近刚参加助演这个戏的名演员李少春、袁世海、李和曾、李金泉等已开始了紧张的读剧本、对台词、创唱腔等准备工作。一团决定在参加排演“穆桂英挂帅”的同时，交插进行“野猪林”、“赤壁之战”、“白毛女”等献礼剧目的精雕细磨，以求进一步达到：表演细腻、节奏鲜明、人物突出、风格完整。
    目前，正在河南安阳巡回演出的三团，听到公报和决议的广播后，就连夜边编边排、创作出两个街头剧，并在第二天给当地群众作了演出。
    在继续跃进的鼓舞下，全院各团间正展开了新的协作。除去“穆桂英挂帅”加强了阵容外，一些献礼的折子戏的阵容也在加强。如二团李和曾演出的“辕门斩子”，现已决定由一团袁世海饰演焦赞。
