    The Dominican People's Anti-Dictatorial Struggle
    Yu Lin
    Currently, a broad movement to boycott the Dominican dictatorial regime is unfolding in Latin America. The purpose of this movement is to express solidarity with the Dominican people's anti-dictatorial struggle, so as to eradicate this important pillar of U.S. imperialism's enslavement and suppression of national and democratic movements in the Caribbean region.
    The Dominican dictatorial regime was fostered single-handedly by the U.S. imperialists. As early as the U.S. military occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1916, Rafael Trujillo, the brother of the current Dominican dictator Hector B. Trujillo, served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He guided the U.S. troops in attacking Dominican guerrillas, exchanging the blood of Dominican patriots for the appreciation of the U.S. colonial authorities. In 1930, he was officially put on the presidential post by the United States. In this way, the United States, through the dictator Trujillo, controlled all aspects of the Dominican economy, politics, and military. The United States turned the Dominican Republic into a country with a single economic crop. Two U.S. companies controlled 80% of the sugar production, accounting for more than 60% of the Dominican national income, and one-third of the country's arable land. By 1943, U.S. industrial investment in the Dominican Republic had reached about 80% of all Dominican industrial investment. U.S. banks controlled the lifeline of the Dominican Republic's financial economy and owned their own railways, seaports, etc. Half of the Dominican Republic's foreign trade relied on the United States, and even customs was directly managed by the United States. The Dominican Republic was part of the United States' voting machine in the United Nations. The United States had the right to command its army and freely use military bases on its territory.
    The Dominican dictator not only made the Dominican Republic completely subservient to the enslavement of U.S. colonialists, but has also consistently been an accomplice of U.S. imperialism in suppressing national and democratic movements in Latin America and supporting other dictatorial regimes. As early as 1954, when the United States conspired to subvert the democratic government of Guatemala, the dictator Trujillo used weapons and money to assist the Guatemalan traitor Armas. After the outbreak of the anti-dictatorial armed struggle in Cuba, the Dominican Republic also shipped military supplies to aid the Cuban dictator Batista. After the victory of the Cuban revolution, the Dominican Republic became the vanguard of U.S. armed intervention in Cuba. Following U.S. instructions, it instigated the three most vicious conspiracies of intervention against Cuba. On June 12, the dictator Trujillo, under the direction of the United States, attempted to bomb Cuba's Oriente Province in order to disrupt Cuba's land reform plan and force Cuba to make concessions to the United States on the land reform issue; on the eve of the Cuban commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the July 26th Movement, the dictator Trujillo drew up a meticulous plan to subvert the Cuban government; before the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Americas, the dictator Trujillo, together with Batista elements, planned a huge conspiracy of armed invasion of Cuba, preparing to launch attacks on the Cuban capital, Havana, and the Isle of Pines in western Cuba. These conspiracies were all crushed under the strict advance precautions of the Cuban government.
    The Dominican dictatorial regime is the regime of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Trujillo himself is the largest landlord and capitalist in the Dominican Republic. The land he owns accounts for 55% of the country's fertile land, making him one of the richest tycoons in the Americas. His assets are estimated at billions of U.S. dollars, with deposits in one bank in New York alone amounting to 65 million U.S. dollars. The Trujillo family is the largest monopoly capital group in the Dominican Republic. Under the cruel exploitation of this group, the Dominican people live an extremely poor and miserable life. Most people live in "houses" made of palm leaves and sleep on the ground. They cannot afford food, and in the fruit season, they eat fruit as meals. Many people, forced by life, have to carry out some primitive production on the slopes abandoned by foreign companies or local landlords. Such slopes become barren and unable to grow crops in the following year.
    While cruelly exploiting the Dominican people economically, the dictator Trujillo carried out bloody terror rule politically. Apart from Trujillo's own party, other political parties were declared illegal. The People's Socialist Party (Communist Party) has always been underground, and its General Secretary, Valdez, was murdered in 1950. The labor movement was brutally suppressed. Trujillo established a widespread intelligence system and censorship system, and also established an intelligence organization called the "Trujillo Guard" in universities. The bodies of murdered people are often found in the Dominican Republic. Because too many people are arrested, hospitals have also been turned into prisons. Since mid-August this year, the wave of terror has intensified. Incidents of innocent youth and people from all walks of life being arbitrarily killed are emerging one after another.
    The Dominican people have never ceased their struggle against the dictatorial regime of Trujillo. Especially after the victory of the Cuban Revolution, anti-dictatorial organizations of the Dominican people have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. These anti-dictatorial organizations have formed a united front and adopted a minimum program in March of this year, including the establishment of a revolutionary democratic government, the implementation of land reform, and the guarantee of basic civil rights. In mid-June, the Dominican Republic broke out into an anti-dictatorial armed struggle. Anti-dictatorial forces have established two bases for armed struggle in the Constanza mountainous area in the central part and the Puerto Plata Province mountainous area in the north. In order to deal with the expanding military operations of the insurgent army, Trujillo's troops in the Puerto Plata area had increased to as many as 4,000 by the beginning of September. Recently, anti-dictatorial forces active in the northern mountainous area launched an attack on government troops. Their activities are cooperating with underground organizations of anti-dictatorial struggle at home.
    Deep cracks have also appeared within the Dominican dictatorial regime. At the beginning of this year, Trujillo secretly shot and killed the Dominican Vice President Joaquin Balaguer, and in July, he assassinated the Minister of Labor, Mareo Aristi, who "expressed discontent." The Chief of Staff, Bonetti Burgos, was also dismissed for "not being resolute in fighting the insurgent army." At the same time, Dominican Ambassador to Ecuador Hernandez and Secretary of the Delegation to the United Nations, Emilio Cordero Mitchell, resigned one after another due to dissatisfaction with Trujillo's tyranny. Discontent has also spread to the dictator's army. A group of naval and air force officers have been arrested, and newly recruited soldiers are fleeing one after another, making it almost impossible to train them, so that the dictator Trujillo has had to hire a large number of foreign personnel to fight.
    As the statement of the Dominican People's Socialist Party on July 27 pointed out, the "direction of the development of the situation in the Dominican Republic is that the scale of the domestic anti-dictatorial struggle is getting larger and larger, and the Trujillo regime has begun to collapse." The U.S. imperialism-raised, cruel and tyrannical dictatorial regime will not last long.

    多米尼加人民的反独裁斗争
    郁林
    目前，拉丁美洲正在展开一个广泛的抵制多米尼加独裁政权的运动，这一运动的目的是声援多米尼加人民的反独裁斗争，以便铲除这个美帝国主义奴役镇压加勒比海地区民族、民主运动的重要支柱。
    多米尼加独裁政权是美帝国主义者一手扶植起来的。早在1916年美国军事占领多米尼加期间，现在的多米尼加独裁者埃克托·布·特鲁希略的哥哥拉斐尔·特鲁希略就在美国海军陆战队中任职。他引导美国军队进攻多米尼加游击队，用多米尼加爱国者的鲜血换来美国殖民当局对他的赏识，在1930年就被美国正式扶上总统职位。这样，美国就通过特鲁希略独裁者，控制了多米尼加经济、政治、军事的各个方面。美国把多米尼加变成单一经济作物的国家，两家美国公司控制占多米尼加国民收入60％以上的蔗糖生产的80％和占全国耕地面积三分之一的土地。到1943年美国在多米尼加的工业投资已经达到多米尼加全部工业投资的80％左右。美国银行控制了多米尼加的财政经济命脉，并且拥有自己的铁路、海港等。多米尼加的对外贸易一半依靠美国，甚至海关也是由美国直接管理的。多米尼加是美国在联合国中的表决机器的一部分。美国有权指挥它的军队和自由使用它领土上的军事基地。
    多米尼加独裁者不但使多米尼加完全屈从于美国殖民者的奴役之下，而且一贯是美帝国主义镇压拉丁美洲民族、民主运动和扶植其他独裁政权的帮凶。早在1954年，美国阴谋颠复危地马拉民主政府时，特鲁希略独裁者就曾用武器和金钱援助过危地马拉卖国贼阿马斯。在古巴爆发反独裁的武装斗争之后，多米尼加也曾运送军火援助古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔。在古巴革命胜利以后，多米尼加更成为美国武装干涉古巴的急先锋。它遵照美国意旨，策动了对古巴的最凶狠的三次干涉阴谋。6月12日，特鲁希略独裁者在美国指使下曾企图轰炸古巴的奥连特省，以便打乱古巴的土地改革计划，迫使古巴在土地改革问题上对美国让步；在古巴纪念7月26日运动六周年的前夕，特鲁希略独裁者曾拟定周密的颠复古巴政府的暴动计划；在美洲外长会议开幕之前，特鲁希略独裁者和巴蒂斯塔分子一起，又策划了武装进攻古巴的巨大阴谋，准备向古巴首都哈瓦那和古巴西部的皮诺斯岛发动进攻。这些阴谋都在古巴政府的事先严密防范下而被粉碎。
    多米尼加独裁政权是大地主大资产阶级的政权。特鲁希略本人就是多米尼加最大的地主和资本家。他所拥有的土地占全国肥沃土地的55％，是美洲最大的富豪之一，他的财产以十亿美元计算，仅在纽约一家银行的存款就达六千五百万美元。特鲁希略家族是多米尼加最大的垄断资本集团，在这个集团的残酷剥削下，多米尼加人民过着极其贫困和悲惨的生活。大多数人住在用棕榈叶搭成的“房子”里，睡在泥地上。他们买不起粮食，在有水果的季节，就用水果当饭吃。许多人迫于生活，不得不在外国公司或本国地主所遗弃的山坡上进行一点原始的生产，这样的山坡在第二年就贫瘠得长不出庄稼了。
    特鲁希略独裁者在经济上对多米尼加人民实行残酷剥削的同时，在政治上则实行血腥的恐怖统治。除了特鲁希略自己的党之外，其他政党都被宣布为非法，人民社会党（共产党）一直处于地下，总书记瓦尔迪兹1950年被杀害。劳工运动受到残酷镇压。特鲁希略建立了广泛的特务系统和新闻检查制度，在大学里也成立了“特鲁希略卫队”的特务组织。在多米尼加经常发现被杀害者的尸体，由于被捕的人太多，医院也变成了监狱。今年8月中以来，恐怖浪潮更加剧了。无辜青年和各界人士被任意杀害的事件层出不穷。
    多米尼加人民从来没有停止过反对特鲁希略独裁政权的斗争。特别是在古巴革命胜利以后，多米尼加人民反独裁斗争的组织像雨后春笋一样纷纷出现。这些反独裁组织已经结成一个统一阵线，并且在今年3月通过了一个包括成立革命的民主政府、实行土地改革和保障公民的基本权利的最低纲领。6月中旬，多米尼加更爆发了反独裁的武装斗争。反独裁部队已经在中部康斯坦萨山区和北部普拉塔港省山区建立了两个武装斗争根据地。为了对付日益扩大的起义军的军事行动，普拉塔港地区的特鲁希略军队在9月初已经增加到四千人之多。最近活动在北部山区的反独裁部队向政府军发动了袭击。他们的活动与国内反独裁斗争的地下组织相配合。
    多米尼加独裁政权内部也出现深刻的裂痕。今年年初，特鲁希略秘密枪杀了多米尼加副总统豪金·巴拉格尔，7月又暗杀了“流露出不满情绪”的劳工部长马雷罗·阿里斯蒂，总参谋长博内蒂·布尔戈斯也因“打击起义军不坚决”而被革职。与此同时，多米尼加驻厄瓜多尔大使埃尔南德斯和驻联合国代表团秘书埃米略·科尔德罗·密歇尔都因不满特鲁希略暴政而先后辞职。不满情绪还扩展到独裁者的军队，已经有一批海、空军军官被捕，新征来的士兵纷纷逃跑，几乎无法训练，以致特鲁希略独裁者不得不雇用大量的外籍人员作战。
    正如多米尼加人民社会党7月27日的声明所指出的，多米尼加“局势发展的方向是，国内反独裁斗争的规模越来越大，特鲁希略政权已开始崩溃”。美帝国主义所豢养的，这个残民以逞的独裁政权寿命不会长久了。
