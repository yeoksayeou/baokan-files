    解放军女队昨险胜广东女队
    据新华社14日讯　第一届全国运动会篮球决赛今天在北京和天津两地举行六场比赛。至此，决赛已共进行六十六场，正是赛程的一半。
    今天比赛结果，解放军男女队双胜广东队，男队比数为八十比五十八，女队比数为六十四比六十三；吉林男女队分别胜江苏男女队，男队比数为九十一比八十六，女队比数为六十六比四十九；上海男队以九十二比六十三胜陕西队；上海女队以五十四比四十二胜贵州队。
    解放军女篮对广东女篮是一场扣人心弦的激战。双方都采取联防结合快攻的战术，比赛开始两队互有胜负。上半场结束时，解放军队以三十二比二十九领先。下半场局势更加紧张，许多险球使得七千多名观众不断发出惊叹和欢呼声，广东队追到四十平以后，双方比数一直齐头并进，在散场的锣将要敲响时，广东队尚以六十三比六十二占先，但正是这时广东队队员李守筠不慎犯规，被追罚两球，结果为解放军女球队以六十四比六十三获胜。
