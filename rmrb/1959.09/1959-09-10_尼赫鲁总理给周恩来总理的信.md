Prime Minister Nehru's Letter to Premier Zhou Enlai

To His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, Beijing

Dear Mr. Premier:

I. Thank you for your letter of January 23rd, which I have read with the care and attention it deserves.

II. I am grateful to you for the facilities that your government has granted to our small delegation that visited China to study your water conservancy methods and plans. Two more delegations—one to study methods of increasing agricultural production and the other to study your steel plans—will also arrive in China soon. I have no doubt that this opportunity to examine the remarkable progress you have made in these areas will be instructive for them.

III. We were pleased to receive Mr. Zhang Hanfu in India, and I hope his brief visit was pleasant and enabled him to see some of our own efforts in developing our resources. I fully agree with you that such mutual visits could greatly help to solve some of the similar problems that our two countries face in striving to accelerate the pace of economic development.

IV. Upon receiving your letter, I re-examined the basis for determining the boundary between India and the Tibet region of China. It is true that not all sections of this boundary have been demarcated on the ground, but I was somewhat surprised to hear that this boundary has never been accepted by the Chinese government at any time. You may know that the traditional boundary follows the geographical principle of being bounded by the watershed of the Himalayan peaks, but beyond that, most of it has been confirmed by specific international agreements between the then Indian government and the Chinese central government. It might be beneficial if I draw your attention to a few of these agreements:

(1) Sikkim—The boundary between Sikkim, a protectorate of India, and the Tibet region of China was determined by the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1890 and jointly demarcated on the ground in 1895.

(2) The Ladakh region of the Jammu and Kashmir state—A treaty between Kashmir on the one hand and the Chinese Emperor and the Lama Guru of Lhasa on the other in 1842 referred to the Indo-Chinese border in the Ladakh region. In 1847, the Chinese government acknowledged that this section of the boundary was adequately and clearly defined. The area now claimed by China has always been described as part of India on official maps, has been surveyed by Indian officials, and even a Chinese map from 1893 marks it as Indian territory.

(3) The McMahon Line—As you know, the so-called McMahon Line runs east from the eastern border of Bhutan, delineating the boundary between China and India and Burma. Contrary to what you have been told, the fact is that this line was drawn at the tripartite conference held in Simla in 1913-1914 by the plenipotentiaries of the Chinese government, Tibet, and India. In accepting the delineation of this boundary, the Tibetan plenipotentiary, Lonchen Shatra, explicitly stated in the exchange of letters that he had received instructions from Lhasa to agree to the boundary marked on the map attached to the convention. This line was drawn after full discussion and subsequently affirmed by formal exchange of letters; and there is nothing to indicate that the Tibetan authorities were in any way dissatisfied with the agreed boundary. Furthermore, although the Chinese plenipotentiary attending the meeting expressed objections to the lines between Inner and Outer Tibet and between Tibet and China, no mention was made by the Chinese side of any reservations regarding the Indo-Tibetan boundary, either during the discussions or when they initialed the convention. The line has the advantage of following the crest of the Himalayas, which forms the natural boundary between the Tibetan Plateau to the north and the foothills to the south. In our previous discussions, especially when you visited India in January 1957, we were pleased to note that you were prepared to accept this line as the Sino-Indian border in this region, and I hope that we will reach an understanding on this basis.

V. Thus, as far as these three sections, which account for the majority of our border with China, are concerned, the boundaries drawn on our published maps have full authority based on geography, tradition, and treaties. The remaining section from the tri-junction of Nepal, India, and Tibet to Ladakh is also traditional and follows obvious geographical features. Here, the boundary also follows a clear watershed between the water systems to the south and west and the water systems to the north and east. Old revenue records and maps, as well as decades of Indian exercise of administrative power up to the border, confirm this delineation.

VI. As for Barahoti (which you call Wu-je), I agree with you that the issue of its rightful ownership should be resolved through consultation. In the negotiations conducted last year, we provided extensive documentary evidence to show that this area has been under Indian jurisdiction and is deep within our borders. Until contrary evidence can be presented, on-site investigation is unlikely to provide any useful clues. Nevertheless, we agreed that both sides should agree not to send civil or military officials to the area. Unfortunately, your delegation did not agree with our proposal. I have learned that since our civil personnel withdrew in early winter last year, large numbers of Chinese civil and military personnel with weapons have been sent into the area to camp, and the situation has changed greatly since then. If the reports we have received about a group of armed Chinese personnel camping and establishing permanent structures in Hoti during the winter are correct, it appears that unconventional unilateral actions are being taken to support your claim to the disputed area.

VII. I very much hope that after studying the above paragraphs, you will be convinced that the delineation of our boundaries published on our maps is not only based on natural and geographical features, but also conforms to tradition, and a large part is confirmed by international agreements. I need not say that independent India will be the last country to make any encroachment beyond its defined borders. It was on the basis of believing that the overall issue of our common border had been resolved to the satisfaction of both sides that I repeatedly announced publicly and in Parliament that there was no doubt about our borders as marked on the published maps. We had thought that our position had been clearly understood and accepted by your government. However, due to the unfortunate differences in opinion between our two governments regarding the delineation of the border in some places, I agree that both sides should respect the situation that existed before the recent disputes occurred, and neither side should attempt to take unilateral action to exercise rights that it believes belong to it. Furthermore, if any land has been acquired recently, this situation should be rectified.

VIII. You will understand that the continued publication of Chinese maps that include large tracts of Indian and Bhutanese territory as part of China is inconsistent with long-established custom and treaties, and this is a matter of great concern to us. As I said in my previous letter, we greatly value our friendship with China. Our two countries have formulated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which have now been widely accepted in other countries of the world. It would be extremely unfortunate if these border issues now affect the friendly relations that exist between our two countries. Therefore, I hope that an understanding can be reached on this matter as soon as possible.

With kind regards.

Jawaharlal Nehru (signed)

### 尼赫鲁总理给周恩来总理的信

1959-09-10
第2版()
专栏：

    尼赫鲁总理给周恩来总理的信北京中华人民共和国总理周恩来先生阁下亲爱的总理先生：
    一、谢谢你1月23日的来信，这封信我已经用它所应得的细心和注意读过了。
    二、贵国政府对我们访问中国去考察你们的水利方法和计划的小代表团给予了便利，为此我对你很感激。还有两个代表团——一个去考察农业增产的方法，另一个去考察你们的钢铁计划——不久也将抵达中国。我毫不怀疑，这次考察贵国在这些方面所取得的显著进展的机会，将会给他们教益。
    三、我们很高兴地在印度接待了章汉夫先生，我希望他的短暂的访问很愉快，并且使他能够看到一些我们自己在开发我国资源方面的努力。我完全同意你的意见，双方的这种相互访问能够大大有助于解决我们两国在努力加快经济发展速度方面各自所面临的有些类似的问题。
    四、接到你的来信，我又查考了确定印度和中国西藏地方之间的疆界的基础。诚然这条疆界的所有各段并没有都在地面上加以标定，但是听到说这条疆界在任何时候都未曾为中国政府所接受，却使我有点惊异。你也许知道，传统的疆界是遵循以喜马拉雅山脉峰顶的分水岭为界的地理原则的，但是除此以外，它的大多数部分是由当时的印度政府和中国中央政府之间的专门的国际协定确认的。如果我提请你注意这些协定中的几项，也许是有利的：
    （1）锡金——印度的保护国锡金同中国西藏地方的边界，是由1890年的英中专约所确定，1895年共同在地面上标定。
    （2）查谟和克什米尔邦的拉达克区——1842年克什米尔为一方与中国皇帝和拉萨古鲁喇嘛为另一方之间的一项条约提到印中在拉达克区的边界。1847年中国政府承认这段边界是充分而明确地确定了的。现在中国主张属它的地区，在官方地图上一向被描述为印度的一部分，曾由印度官员测量过，而且连1893年的一种中国地图也标明它是印度的领土。
    （3）麦克马洪线——如你所知，所谓麦克马洪线是从不丹的东部边界东迤，划定了中国同印缅的边界。和你所听到报告的情况相反，事实上这条线是在1913—1914年中国政府、西藏和印度的全权代表在西姆拉举行的三边会议上划出的。在接受这段疆界的画法的时候，西藏全权代表伦兴夏托拉在换文中曾明白地说，他已经从拉萨奉到训令，同意专约附图上所标明的疆界。这条线是在充分讨论之后划出，其后为正式换文所肯定；并且没有任何东西说明西藏当局在任何方面不满于协议的边界。再者，虽然出席会议的中国全权代表对内、外藏之间和西藏、中国之间的界线表示反对，无论在讨论期间或者在他们在专约上画押时，都没有提到中国方面对印藏疆界有任何保留。这条线适巧有一个优点，它是沿着形成北边的西藏高原与南边的山麓地区之间的天然分界线喜马拉雅山脉的峰顶走的。以前我们讨论时，特别是1957年1月你访问印度时，我们很满意地注意到你准备接受这条线作为这个地区的中印疆界，而且我希望我们将在这个基础上达成谅解。
    五、这样，就占我国同中国的边界的大部分的这三段来说，我们出版的地图上所画的边界是具有基于地理、传统和条约的充分权威性的。剩下的从尼泊尔、印度、西藏三方交界处到拉达克的一段也是传统的，并且是沿着明显的地理特点的。在这里，边界也是沿着处于南面和西面的水系与北面和东面的水系之间的明显的分水岭走的。老的税收记录和地图，以及几十年来印度行使行政权力及到边界一事，肯定了这种画法。
    六、至于巴拉霍蒂（你们称乌热），我同意你们的意见，应该通过协商来解决它的合法归属问题。在去年进行的谈判中，我们提供了广泛的文件证据，说明这个地区一直在印度管辖之下，并且深处在我们的边疆之内。在能够提出相反的证据以前，实地调查很难提供什么有用的线索。虽然如此，我们同意双方协议不派民政或军事官员到该区去。不幸，你们的代表团不同意我们的建议。我得悉，由于在我们的民政人员在去冬之初撤走之后，带有武器的中国民政和军事人员成批地派入该区扎营，从那时以来情况已起了很大的变化。如果我们所接到的关于冬天有一批武装的中国人员在霍蒂扎营和建立永久性建筑物的报告是正确的话，看来正在采取不合习惯的片面行动，来支持你们对争执中的地区所提出的要求。
    七、我很希望，研究了上面各段以后，你会信服，我们的地图所发表的我们疆界的画法不仅是根据天然的和地理的特点，而且也符合传统，并且一大部分是为国际协定所肯定的。我不需要赘言，独立的印度将是最后一个国家在它的确定的疆界以外进行任何侵占。正是基于相信我们两国共同疆界的总的问题业已得到令双方满意的解决，我才几次公开地和在议会里宣布，对于出版了的地图上所标明的我国疆界，是没有怀疑的余地的。我们原以为我们的立场已经为贵国政府所明白了解和接受。然而，由于我们两国政府之间不幸对疆界的画法在几处地方存在一些看法的分歧，我同意双方应该尊重在最近的那些争执发生之前所存在的情况，双方都不应该试图采取片面行动去行使自认为属于它的权利。再则，如果有任何土地为最近所取得的话，这种情况应予纠正。
    八、你会理解，继续出版把大块印度和不丹的领土划入中国的中国地图，是不符合长期确立的习惯和条约的，这并且是引起我们极大关切的事。正如我在前次信中说过的，我们很珍视我们同中国的友谊。我们两国制定了潘查希拉原则，这些原则现在已在世界其他国家中得到广泛的接受。要是这些边疆问题现在影响到我们两国间存在的友好关系的话，那会是极其不幸的。因此我希望在这件事上能早日达成谅解。
    致亲切的敬意。
                        贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁（签字）
