The Discussion of Six Hundred Million People
　　Li Shao Cen

A friend said to me: "The Eighth Plenary Session was a good one. The figures were verified, and the targets were implemented. These are all good things. But just one thing, is it possible not to announce it or announce it a little later? Why bother to provoke comments from some imperialist critics, which are annoying to hear.” I said: "I'm afraid there's really something wrong with your ears. The croaking of frogs ten miles away makes your ears itch; but you seem not to hear the loud calls right next to you." He asked in surprise, "Who else is discussing it?" "Who? Not one or two people, it is our six hundred million people who are discussing it."

Only those who look down on the masses can only hear the discussions of the Western masters and not hear the voices of the six hundred million people. Anyone who lacks a mass viewpoint has fragile nerves. Their nerves can be so weak that they faint as soon as they hear what the foreign masters say, and even chime in with nonsense. The only panacea for curing this neurasthenia is to recognize the power of the masses. How are the six hundred million people discussing the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session after their publication? This is the major event that deserves attention. Have you heard it? How do you feel about it?

From the Pamirs to the East China Sea, from the Heilongjiang River to the Xisha Islands, on the vast land, where is there no lively discussion? For the matter of our own country's construction, who ultimately has the authority to speak? Who has the final say? Is it those standing aside watching the jokes and making sarcastic remarks? Or is it we, the actual undertakers of the construction task—the six hundred million people? Moreover, we also have many friends abroad. We are the ones who gain the most support. Many brother countries are cheering and encouraged by our achievements. They have helped us before, and they will continue to help us in the future. The voice of more than one billion people is as vast as the Pacific Ocean. How can a few slanders by a handful of imperialist elements stir up any waves?

Moreover, heroic people are definitely not people who "hesitate to speak, and falter to advance." They do what they say. Under the great fighting call of the Party, Anshan Iron and Steel Company overproduced every day from August 26 to 29, with daily output 764 tons higher than the average daily output of the previous twenty-five days. Coal mine workers in Shandong Province have continuously broken the 60,000-ton mark of daily coal production since August 27. These are just things that happened within three days after the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session. It is truly "a scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes." Such rapid action and vigorous leap forward should be unprecedented! Zhang Qiuxiang, a national cotton-growing expert, said: "All cotton-growing women must catch up with me." This is the latest news that the total output of early rice in Suzhou Prefecture has more than doubled compared with last year.

Six hundred million people are discussing it, and they are taking action. This force has the momentum of overturning mountains and overwhelming seas, and the force of thunder. Six hundred million people are full of fighting spirit and are accelerating their pace forward. Only those who are blinded by a leaf cannot see this majestic momentum; only those who have their ears plugged with beans cannot hear this thunderous roar!

    六亿人民的议论
    黎少岑
    有一位朋友对我说：“八中全会开得好，数字核实，指标落实，这都是好事，就只一点，是不是可以不公布或者迟一点公布，何必惹得一些帝国主义国家的评论家都议论纷纷，听了有些讨厌。”我说：“只怕你的耳朵是真出毛病了，十里蛙声能使你耳痒；可是就在你身边的大声疾呼，你却好像未听见一般。”他吃惊地问了：“还有谁在议论？”“谁？不是一个两个人，是我们六亿人民在议论”。
    只有轻视群众的人，才只听到西方老爷的议论，听不到六亿人民的呼声。大凡没有群众观点的人神经都是脆弱的，他的神经可以衰弱到这样一个地步，一听到外国老爷讲什么就吓昏了，甚至于也跟着胡诌了。医治这种神经衰弱的唯一灵丹妙药，是认识群众的力量。八中全会的文件公布后六亿人民群众是怎样在议论，这才是值得注意的大事，你听到了没有呢？你又感觉到怎样呢？
    从葱岭到东海，从黑龙江到西沙群岛，在广阔的地面上，哪一处不议论得热火朝天。我们自己建设自己国家的事情，究竟谁说了有准？谁说了算数？是那站在一旁看笑话，说风凉话的？还是我们这建设任务的实际承担者——六亿人民？何况，我们在国外也有众多的朋友，我们是得道多助，多少兄弟国家在为我们的成就欢呼、鼓舞，他们以前帮助过我们，以后也还要帮助我们。十亿以上人民的呼声像太平洋一样的浩荡，凭一小撮帝国主义分子的几句诬蔑能翻腾出什么波浪来。
    而且，英雄的人民，完全不是“口将言而嗫嚅，足将进而趦趄”的人，他们说了就干。鞍钢在党的伟大战斗号召下，从8月26到29日天天超产，日产量高于前二十五天的平均日产量七百六十四吨。山东省煤矿职工从8月27日起连续突破日产六万吨煤炭的大关。这都不过是八中全会文件公布后三天以内的事情，真是“士别三日，当刮目相看”。这样行动的迅速，跃进的猛烈，该是史无前例吧！全国植棉能手张秋香说：“要所有务棉妇女都赶上我”。这是最近的消息，苏州专区的早稻总产量就比去年增加了一倍多。
    六亿人民在议论了，在行动了，这股力量有排山倒海、雷霆万钧之势。六亿人民正斗志昂扬，加速步伐地前进。只有一叶障目的人，才看不见这磅礴的声势；只有两豆塞耳的人，才听不到这喧响如雷的吼声！
