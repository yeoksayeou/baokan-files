Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 12th: The Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory produced fifty-six C616 lathes from the 1st to the 10th, all of which met quality standards, completing 34.57% of the entire month's plan. The workers are summarizing their experiences in successfully completing the plan for the first ten days of September and are determined to continue their efforts to present a gift to the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with the achievement of exceeding the C616 lathe production task by twenty-eight units and completing the third quarter plan one to three days ahead of schedule.

After the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was published, the factory's workers expressed their determination, made proposals, issued battle reports, and enthusiastically launched paired competitions between workshops and rivalries between individuals. Ma Lizhen, a young female lathe operator, improved her tools, implemented a one-tool, three-edge approach, increased work efficiency by more than double, and can now complete twenty-one hours of work each day. She is already working on the tasks for February 1960. Gao Haiquan, a worker in a single workshop, improved tools and processing methods, and can complete twenty-eight hours of tasks a day. Yao Jiashen, an old fitter, improved the templates, strengthened the cooperation between master and apprentice, and completed eighteen and a half days of work in four days. In the first ten days of September, three hundred and seven people in the factory broke through their work quotas by using technological innovation methods. The work style of the factory's cadres has also become more in-depth and meticulous. All workshops have focused on short-term plans to ensure "daily plans are completed on the same day."

    济南第一机床厂展开大竞赛  十天完成全月计划34.57％
    新华社济南12日电　济南第一机床厂1日到10日共生产出质量全部合格的C六一六车床五十六台，完成全月计划34.57％。职工们正在总结胜利完成9月上旬计划的经验，决心再接再厉用超额二十八台完成C六一六车床生产任务、提前一天到三天完成第三季度计划的成就，向伟大的国庆十周年献礼。
    党的八届八中全会公报公布后，这个厂的职工纷纷表决心，提倡议，下战表，热烈地开展了车间与车间之间的对口赛，人与人之间的对手赛。青年女车工马丽珍改进刀具，实行一刀三刃，提高工作效率一倍多，每天能完成二十一小时的活，现在她已经在干1960年2月份的工作了。单个车间工人高海泉改进刀具和加工方法，一天能完成二十八小时的任务。老钳工姚家深改进样板，加强师徒配合，四天，就完成十八天半的工作任务。9月上旬，这个厂就有三百零七人用技术革新的方法，突破了工作定额。厂的干部工作作风也更深入细致了。各车间都大抓短期计划，保证“当日计划，当日完成”。
