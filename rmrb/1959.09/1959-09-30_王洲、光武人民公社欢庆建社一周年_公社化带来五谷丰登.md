Wangzhou People's Commune Added Four Water Pumps, Achieving Guaranteed Harvests Regardless of Drought or Flood; Commune Members' Food Ration Increased by 10% Compared to the Same Period Last Year. Guangwu People's Commune's Wheat Production Increased by 44%; Autumn Crops Suffered a Hundred-Day Drought, but Still Increased Production by 44% Compared to Last Year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th: The male and female members of the Wangzhou People's Commune in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, gathered on the afternoon of the 24th to warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the commune's establishment, the great victory of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, and the unprecedented bumper harvest brought about by communization.

The Wangzhou Commune is located on a sandbar in the heart of the scenic Fuchun River. The terrain here is low-lying, and before liberation, it was either flooded or drought-stricken all year round. Crop yields were very low, and residents of the island could only eat white rice during the New Year and holidays. After cooperativization, a 37-li-long flood control dike was built, reservoirs were built, and many new ponds were dug. After communization, the flood control dike was raised by one meter, and four more water pumps were purchased, realizing mechanized irrigation. This year, there were three floods in a row in the first half of the year, but the crops suffered no losses. The dream of the people of the island for thousands of years to build dikes to prevent floods and divert water to prevent droughts has been realized.

At the celebration meeting, Sun Jiliang, the director of the commune, reported to the members on the great achievements of the commune since its establishment in September last year. He said that in the first year of communization, an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved. This year, the total output of summer crops and early rice increased by 32% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The average yield per mu of 4,693 mu of early rice was 102 jin more than in 1958. In the first half of this year, each of the 7,867 commune members received an average of 10% more food ration than in the same period last year. In the summer harvest pre-distribution, each household received an average of 15 yuan more than in the same period last year. At present, the late rice and miscellaneous grain crops are growing very well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The output of the local specialty - Kengbian straw paper and silkworm cocoons - has exceeded that of 1958, and the number of pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits has also increased compared to the same period last year.

Sun Jiliang said excitedly: These achievements were brought about by the People's Commune. It is enough to talk about the following things. Last winter and this spring, the commune adjusted 2,529 mu of "interspersed fields" left over from the small-scale peasant economy, so that the land of each production team was connected into one piece, and the members lived closer to the fields, saving 5,000 workdays per year in round-trip travel time. The commune set up public canteens and nurseries, and the number of women participating in production increased from 953 to 1,835.

At the end of the celebration meeting, everyone watched the cultural programs performed by the Fuyang Yue Opera Troupe.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 28th: The Guangwu People's Commune in Jieshou County, Anhui Province, has seen thriving development in all sectors and bumper harvests of all grains in the past year. Recently, the commune held a celebration meeting to grandly celebrate the first anniversary of its establishment.

At the celebration meeting, the secretary of the commune party committee, labor models, the elderly, and women all used their own personal experiences to praise the tremendous changes that have taken place in the past year. They said that since the establishment of the Guangwu Commune, all sectors have prospered and all grains have had bumper harvests. After the establishment of the commune, it first vigorously built farmland water conservancy projects, rationally planned the land, and purchased five tractors and many large agricultural implements. The commune also established collective welfare undertakings, liberating 16,000 female laborers, thereby smoothly implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and enabling grain production to achieve a leap in growth. This year, the commune's 117,800 mu of wheat achieved a bumper harvest of 250 jin per mu, an increase of 44% in average yield per mu compared to last year. Although the autumn crops suffered a hundred-day drought, the commune immediately organized more than 40,000 people to fight the drought day and night, digging 22,350 wells and opening 398 ditches and ponds, finally overcoming the natural disaster. Now, more than 22,000 mu of dry autumn crops have achieved a bumper harvest of 260 jin per mu, an increase of 44% compared to last year's 180 jin per mu; more than 13,000 mu of dry land converted to rice cultivation have an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu, an increase of 33% compared to the same period last year. The commune-run industry of this commune, like agricultural production, is also developing rapidly. The commune has established 254 factories of various sizes, including machinery factories, native fertilizer factories, and pesticide factories. In the past year, it has manufactured 72,000 various agricultural implements and produced a total of 35 million jin of native fertilizer and native pesticides, which has strongly supported agricultural production. The industrial output value has increased fourfold compared to the same period last year. At the same time, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also been comprehensively developed due to the commune's rational arrangement of labor. There are now more than 10,800 large domestic animals such as cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses, more than 56,000 pigs and sheep, and more than 541,000 chickens, ducks, and other poultry. Fish farming has reached 5 million, all of which have increased by one to three times compared to last year. Last winter and this spring, 3.3 million trees were planted, more than double the number before communization. With the development of production, 95% of the commune members increased their income this summer, and the vast majority of commune members participated in savings, with deposits reaching more than 240,000 yuan. At the same time, the cultural life of the commune members is also rich and colorful. Now the commune has wired broadcasting stations, film projection teams, amateur cultural and art troupes, and five middle schools and 84 primary schools, and has popularized primary education, so that there is one middle school student for every forty people. At the same time, every team has set up health centers, maternity hospitals, and amateur cultural schools. (Attached picture)

The Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, purchased three tractors after its establishment. In the spring, it used them to plow more than 10,000 mu of land, replacing more than 4,000 manual laborers and more than 6,000 animal power, and the land was plowed deeper.

    王洲、光武人民公社欢庆建社一周年
    公社化带来五谷丰登
    王洲公社添了四台抽水机做到旱涝不失收，社员口粮比去年同期多一成  光武公社小麦产量增长44％，秋作物遭百日大旱，比去年仍然增产44％
    据新华社杭州28日电　浙江省富阳县王洲人民公社男女社员，24日下午集会，热烈庆祝建社一周年，庆祝总路线、大跃进的伟大胜利，庆祝公社化带来了空前大丰收。
    王洲公社在风光明媚的富春江心一个沙洲上。这里地势低洼，解放前，一年四季不是涝就是旱，农作物产量很低，洲上居民要到过年过节才能吃顿白米饭。合作化后修起了长达三十七华里的防洪堤，修了水库，开了许多新的池塘。公社化后把防洪堤增高了一米，又添购了四台抽水机，实现了灌溉机械化。今年上半年一连发了三次洪水，农作物丝毫没有受到损失。洲上人民千百年来筑堤防洪，引水防旱的梦想，已经实现了。
    在庆祝集会上，公社主任孙继良向社员报告了公社从去年9月成立以来的巨大成就。他说，公社化头一年，就取得了史无前例的大丰收。今年夏收作物和早稻总产量比大跃进的1958年增加了32％，四千六百九十三亩早稻，平均每亩产量比1958年多了一百零二斤。今年上半年全社七千八百六十七个社员，每人平均分到的口粮比去年同期多一成。夏收预分中，每户平均比去年同期增加十五元。现在，全社晚稻和杂粮作物生长很好，丰收在望。本地特产——坑边草纸和蚕茧的产量都超过1958年，猪、鸡、鸭、兔也比去年同期增加。
    孙继良兴奋地说：这些成绩是人民公社带来的，单讲下面几件事就够了。去冬今春，公社调整了二千五百二十九亩小农经济遗留下来的“插花田地”，使每个生产队的土地连成一片，社员住的地方距离田地近了，每年省下的往返跑路时间就有五千个工。公社办了公共食堂和托儿所，全社参加生产的妇女从九百五十三人增加到一千八百三十五人。
    庆祝大会结束时，大家观看了富阳越剧团演出的文艺节目。
    据新华社合肥28日电　安徽省界首县光武人民公社一年来五业俱兴，五谷丰登。最近这个公社召开了庆祝大会，隆重庆祝建社一周年。
    在庆祝大会上，公社党委书记、劳动模范、老人、妇女都以自己的亲身体会，歌颂一年来巨大的变化。他们说，光武公社成立以来，五业俱兴，五谷丰登。公社成立后，首先大力兴修了农田水利，合理规划了土地，并购买五部拖拉机和许多大型农具。公社还兴办了集体福利事业，解放了一万六千个妇女劳力，从而顺利贯彻了农业八字宪法，使粮食产量获得飞跃增长。今年全社十一万七千八百亩小麦获得了亩产二百五十斤的大丰收，比去年平均单产提高44％，秋季作物虽遭到百日大旱，由于公社即时组织了四万多名抗旱大军日夜战斗，共打井二万二千三百五十眼，开沟挖塘三百九十八处，终于战胜了自然灾害。现在二万二千多亩旱秋作物已获得了亩产二百六十斤的大丰收，比去年亩产一百八十斤增产44％；一万三千多亩旱地改种的水稻，平均亩产八百多斤，比去年同期增产33％。这个公社的社办工业也和农业生产一样，比翼双飞。全社兴办了机械厂、土化肥厂、农药厂等大小工厂二百五十四个，一年来共制造各种农具七万二千件，生产土化肥和土农药共计三千五百万斤，有力的支持了农业生产，工业产值比去年同期增长四倍。与此同时，林、牧、副、渔也由于公社合理的安排劳力，得到了全面发展。现有牛驴骡马大家畜一万零八百多头，猪、羊五万六千多头，鸡鸭等家禽发展到五十四万一千多只，养鱼五百万尾，这些都比去年增加一到三倍。去冬今春植树造林达三百三十万棵，也比公社化前增加一倍以上。随着生产的发展，今年夏季有95％的社员都增加了收入，绝大部分社员都参加了储蓄，存款达二十四万多元。同时社员的文化生活也丰富多彩，现在公社有有线广播站、电影放映队，业余文工团，和五所中学、八十四所小学，并普及了小学教育，使每四十个人中有一个中学生，同时队队办起了卫生所、妇产院和业余文化学校。（附图片）
