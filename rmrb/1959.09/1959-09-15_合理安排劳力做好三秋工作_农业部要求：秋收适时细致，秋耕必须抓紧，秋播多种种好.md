Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Ministry of Agriculture's notice regarding autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and autumn planting work. The full text is as follows:

Currently, autumn crops in various regions are ripening successively, and early autumn crops are being harvested. The intense Three Autumn Tasks have arrived. Following the great summer harvest, various regions have universally launched campaigns to catch up with the summer harvest during the autumn harvest and to surpass early rice production with late rice production, aiming for over-fulfillment of production increase targets. The people's communes have played a tremendous role in resisting disasters and ensuring harvests, achieving continued leaps forward, and achieving great accomplishments. Under the great call of the communiqu√© and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, an excellent situation of "three highs and three mores" has emerged in rural areas nationwide: high political enthusiasm, high production zeal, high labor efficiency, more commune members working, more cadres laboring, and more advanced examples.

This year, the autumn harvest and autumn planting seasons are more compressed than in previous years because, after the people's communes were established, the sowing times for various crops became more concentrated, and the autumn harvest time also became more concentrated. In areas that have suffered from drought, the drought has been relieved, but some soil moisture conditions are still not good, and some are still fighting drought to protect the autumn harvest. In areas that have suffered from floods, drainage is still required, which increases the tasks of autumn harvest and autumn planting. Various regions must overcome the slackening mood of thinking that the autumn harvest season is long and taking their time. They must mobilize the masses to conscientiously do a good job in the Three Autumn Tasks, resolutely obtain all the fruits of their hard labor, and ensure timely sowing to complete this year's autumn and winter planting plans, laying a solid foundation for a greater summer harvest next year.

In the autumn harvest work, it is essential to achieve good harvesting, good management, and good utilization. First, it is necessary to achieve timely harvesting and ensure that every grain is brought into the granary. Based on the maturity of crops, classify and line them up, harvest each batch as it ripens, and achieve simultaneous harvesting, threshing, sales, and transportation. It is required that ten parts of the yield yield ten parts of harvest, however much grows in the field is harvested, and however much is threshed in the field is put into the granary. Draw on the successful experience of meticulous harvesting and threshing of summer crops this year, ensuring that the ground is clean, the threshing ground is clean, the roads are clean, and the stalks are threshed clean, striving to leave no ears in the field and no grains on the threshing ground. For cotton, it is essential to pick each batch as it opens, picking and collecting everything cleanly. For sweet potatoes, storage cellars and tools for slicing and drying must be prepared in advance to ensure that they are harvested, stored, sliced, and dried without suffering frost damage. For peanuts, it is essential to harvest and pick carefully to ensure that all are harvested and stored in the granary, preventing losses and waste. In autumn harvest work, attention should be paid not only to major crops but also to harvesting minor crops well. In the autumn harvest work, strengthen seed selection, carefully select good seeds, and retain sufficient seeds. In areas prone to autumn rain and early frost damage, make practical preparations for disaster prevention to avoid unexpected losses.

All areas with autumn and winter sowing tasks must seize the time to implement the sowing plan at all levels, all the way down to the contract production units. Continue to promote the "three guarantees and one reward" system and quota management, and quickly implement the area, targets, and measures to the teams, groups, and fields (plots). Ensure the completion of planting tasks, rationally arrange crop rotation according to local conditions, and strive for more planting, high yields, and more harvests. While completing the planting tasks for wheat and rapeseed, reasonable arrangements should also be made for crops such as barley, broad beans, and peas to ensure they are planted well. In particular, for late-stubble land, plant as soon as it is harvested, process and fertilize, and strive for early planting. Generally, plant distant fields first and then nearby fields, cultivate distant fields first, deliver manure first, and plant first, and cultivate nearby fields later, deliver manure later, and plant later, to prevent the occurrence of three types of seedlings. Wheat-producing areas suffered from prolonged drought this summer and autumn. Some areas may continue to experience drought, affecting wheat planting, and a few areas have been flooded, requiring drainage and sowing. We must establish the belief that man can conquer nature, ensure good planting, and strive not to violate the agricultural season. Make full preparations for drought-resistant planting. In areas with irrigation conditions, do a good job in land leveling and give full play to the efficiency of irrigation. In areas without irrigation conditions, emphasize plowing and harrowing simultaneously and do a good job in conserving moisture. Comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions is the fundamental key to ensuring a bumper wheat harvest. The experience of increased wheat production in 1959 proves that deep plowing to a depth of six inches to one foot and applying basal fertilizer equivalent to 5,000 to 10,000 catties of standard stable manure per mu have significant effects on increasing production. We should seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out the movement of plowing wheat fields and storming fertilizer application. Those that have already been deeply plowed to about one foot last year can be plowed ordinarily without deep plowing again. Those that were not deeply plowed last year must still formulate specific plans this year and resolutely carry out deep plowing. It is also necessary to ensure that fertilizer is delivered to the fields before wheat is planted, and resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of planting in hardened fields and sowing without basal dressing. We must resolutely follow the mass line and implement rational close planting. It should neither be too dense, nor must we overcome right-leaning thoughts and prevent the rise of "sparse planting ideas." Autumn sowing seeds should be inspected team by team within each commune to ensure surplus and deficiency adjustments, reserve sufficient quantities, carefully select seeds, and strive to expand the area of improved varieties. Before sowing, it is also necessary to do a good job in seed treatment, eliminate smut disease, and strengthen the prevention and control of underground pests.

Autumn and winter deep plowing can improve the soil, conserve moisture, increase fertility, eliminate overwintering pests, and lay a foundation for a greater agricultural harvest next year. It is necessary to seize the time to carry out the movement of autumn plowing, winter plowing, and deep plowing, eliminating the phenomenon of hard stubble (hardened fields) overwintering. The area of deep plowing should account for about 50% of the area of autumn and winter plowing, and the depth of the cultivated layer should be determined according to different regions, different soils, and different crops. In deep plowing, make full use of tractors and deep plows for deep plowing. If tractors and deep plows are insufficient, adopt the method of tandem plowing to increase work efficiency and save labor.

Autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting are time-sensitive and involve a large amount of farm work. It is necessary to prioritize farm work, make unified plans, and rationally arrange labor. It is necessary to seize the center and strengthen the main attack front, and establish a production responsibility system to closely combine the organization of professional teams with the production responsibility system of contracted areas, without losing sight of the small things because of grasping the big things. Implement the principle of distribution according to work, more work more pay, reasonably stipulate labor quotas, and carry out the movement of production shock workers and high work efficiency. Organizing large-scale cooperation and mutual support according to the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit is an effective way to solve the shortage of labor and improve work efficiency in the Three Autumn Tasks. During the tense period of autumn harvest and autumn planting, mobilizing organs, troops, students, auxiliary labor, and personnel who can be temporarily drawn out to participate in the Three Autumn Tasks is still necessary. During the Three Autumn Tasks, processing industry and sideline production should also be arranged well, and attention should be paid to autumn fertilizer accumulation, grass cutting, grass storage, and autumn vegetable management. Tools for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting should be immediately and universally inspected, repaired where necessary, replenished where necessary, and the necessary quantities should be added. Sufficient preparations should also be made for drying grounds and warehouses. Livelihoods of commune members should be properly arranged, and public welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries should be actively operated to better utilize the labor force of women. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the Three Autumn Tasks, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and launch a vigorous high tide of the Three Autumn Tasks movement. Now, late autumn crops in some areas are still in the growth stage. In accordance with the spirit of "the harvest is not in hand, management does not stop," we must make persistent efforts and continue to strengthen field management in the later stage to strive for the final harvest.
