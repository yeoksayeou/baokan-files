Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Ministry of Agriculture's notice regarding autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and autumn planting work. The full text is as follows:

Currently, autumn crops in various regions are ripening successively, and early autumn crops are being harvested. The intense Three Autumn Tasks have arrived. Following the great summer harvest, various regions have universally launched campaigns to catch up with the summer harvest during the autumn harvest and to surpass early rice production with late rice production, aiming for over-fulfillment of production increase targets. The people's communes have played a tremendous role in resisting disasters and ensuring harvests, achieving continued leaps forward, and achieving great accomplishments. Under the great call of the communiqué and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, an excellent situation of "three highs and three mores" has emerged in rural areas nationwide: high political enthusiasm, high production zeal, high labor efficiency, more commune members working, more cadres laboring, and more advanced examples.

This year, the autumn harvest and autumn planting seasons are more compressed than in previous years because, after the people's communes were established, the sowing times for various crops became more concentrated, and the autumn harvest time also became more concentrated. In areas that have suffered from drought, the drought has been relieved, but some soil moisture conditions are still not good, and some are still fighting drought to protect the autumn harvest. In areas that have suffered from floods, drainage is still required, which increases the tasks of autumn harvest and autumn planting. Various regions must overcome the slackening mood of thinking that the autumn harvest season is long and taking their time. They must mobilize the masses to conscientiously do a good job in the Three Autumn Tasks, resolutely obtain all the fruits of their hard labor, and ensure timely sowing to complete this year's autumn and winter planting plans, laying a solid foundation for a greater summer harvest next year.

In the autumn harvest work, it is essential to achieve good harvesting, good management, and good utilization. First, it is necessary to achieve timely harvesting and ensure that every grain is brought into the granary. Based on the maturity of crops, classify and line them up, harvest each batch as it ripens, and achieve simultaneous harvesting, threshing, sales, and transportation. It is required that ten parts of the yield yield ten parts of harvest, however much grows in the field is harvested, and however much is threshed in the field is put into the granary. Draw on the successful experience of meticulous harvesting and threshing of summer crops this year, ensuring that the ground is clean, the threshing ground is clean, the roads are clean, and the stalks are threshed clean, striving to leave no ears in the field and no grains on the threshing ground. For cotton, it is essential to pick each batch as it opens, picking and collecting everything cleanly. For sweet potatoes, storage cellars and tools for slicing and drying must be prepared in advance to ensure that they are harvested, stored, sliced, and dried without suffering frost damage. For peanuts, it is essential to harvest and pick carefully to ensure that all are harvested and stored in the granary, preventing losses and waste. In autumn harvest work, attention should be paid not only to major crops but also to harvesting minor crops well. In the autumn harvest work, strengthen seed selection, carefully select good seeds, and retain sufficient seeds. In areas prone to autumn rain and early frost damage, make practical preparations for disaster prevention to avoid unexpected losses.

All areas with autumn and winter sowing tasks must seize the time to implement the sowing plan at all levels, all the way down to the contract production units. Continue to promote the "three guarantees and one reward" system and quota management, and quickly implement the area, targets, and measures to the teams, groups, and fields (plots). Ensure the completion of planting tasks, rationally arrange crop rotation according to local conditions, and strive for more planting, high yields, and more harvests. While completing the planting tasks for wheat and rapeseed, reasonable arrangements should also be made for crops such as barley, broad beans, and peas to ensure they are planted well. In particular, for late-stubble land, plant as soon as it is harvested, process and fertilize, and strive for early planting. Generally, plant distant fields first and then nearby fields, cultivate distant fields first, deliver manure first, and plant first, and cultivate nearby fields later, deliver manure later, and plant later, to prevent the occurrence of three types of seedlings. Wheat-producing areas suffered from prolonged drought this summer and autumn. Some areas may continue to experience drought, affecting wheat planting, and a few areas have been flooded, requiring drainage and sowing. We must establish the belief that man can conquer nature, ensure good planting, and strive not to violate the agricultural season. Make full preparations for drought-resistant planting. In areas with irrigation conditions, do a good job in land leveling and give full play to the efficiency of irrigation. In areas without irrigation conditions, emphasize plowing and harrowing simultaneously and do a good job in conserving moisture. Comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" in accordance with local conditions is the fundamental key to ensuring a bumper wheat harvest. The experience of increased wheat production in 1959 proves that deep plowing to a depth of six inches to one foot and applying basal fertilizer equivalent to 5,000 to 10,000 catties of standard stable manure per mu have significant effects on increasing production. We should seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out the movement of plowing wheat fields and storming fertilizer application. Those that have already been deeply plowed to about one foot last year can be plowed ordinarily without deep plowing again. Those that were not deeply plowed last year must still formulate specific plans this year and resolutely carry out deep plowing. It is also necessary to ensure that fertilizer is delivered to the fields before wheat is planted, and resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of planting in hardened fields and sowing without basal dressing. We must resolutely follow the mass line and implement rational close planting. It should neither be too dense, nor must we overcome right-leaning thoughts and prevent the rise of "sparse planting ideas." Autumn sowing seeds should be inspected team by team within each commune to ensure surplus and deficiency adjustments, reserve sufficient quantities, carefully select seeds, and strive to expand the area of improved varieties. Before sowing, it is also necessary to do a good job in seed treatment, eliminate smut disease, and strengthen the prevention and control of underground pests.

Autumn and winter deep plowing can improve the soil, conserve moisture, increase fertility, eliminate overwintering pests, and lay a foundation for a greater agricultural harvest next year. It is necessary to seize the time to carry out the movement of autumn plowing, winter plowing, and deep plowing, eliminating the phenomenon of hard stubble (hardened fields) overwintering. The area of deep plowing should account for about 50% of the area of autumn and winter plowing, and the depth of the cultivated layer should be determined according to different regions, different soils, and different crops. In deep plowing, make full use of tractors and deep plows for deep plowing. If tractors and deep plows are insufficient, adopt the method of tandem plowing to increase work efficiency and save labor.

Autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting are time-sensitive and involve a large amount of farm work. It is necessary to prioritize farm work, make unified plans, and rationally arrange labor. It is necessary to seize the center and strengthen the main attack front, and establish a production responsibility system to closely combine the organization of professional teams with the production responsibility system of contracted areas, without losing sight of the small things because of grasping the big things. Implement the principle of distribution according to work, more work more pay, reasonably stipulate labor quotas, and carry out the movement of production shock workers and high work efficiency. Organizing large-scale cooperation and mutual support according to the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit is an effective way to solve the shortage of labor and improve work efficiency in the Three Autumn Tasks. During the tense period of autumn harvest and autumn planting, mobilizing organs, troops, students, auxiliary labor, and personnel who can be temporarily drawn out to participate in the Three Autumn Tasks is still necessary. During the Three Autumn Tasks, processing industry and sideline production should also be arranged well, and attention should be paid to autumn fertilizer accumulation, grass cutting, grass storage, and autumn vegetable management. Tools for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting should be immediately and universally inspected, repaired where necessary, replenished where necessary, and the necessary quantities should be added. Sufficient preparations should also be made for drying grounds and warehouses. Livelihoods of commune members should be properly arranged, and public welfare undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries should be actively operated to better utilize the labor force of women. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the Three Autumn Tasks, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command and launch a vigorous high tide of the Three Autumn Tasks movement. Now, late autumn crops in some areas are still in the growth stage. In accordance with the spirit of "the harvest is not in hand, management does not stop," we must make persistent efforts and continue to strengthen field management in the later stage to strive for the final harvest.

    合理安排劳力做好三秋工作
    农业部要求：秋收适时细致，秋耕必须抓紧，秋播多种种好
    新华社14日讯　农业部关于秋收、秋耕、秋种工作的通知。全文如下：
    目前各地秋季作物陆续成熟，早秋作物正在收割，紧张的三秋工作已经到来。各地继夏季大丰收之后，普遍开展了秋收赶夏收、晚稻超早稻的超额增产运动，人民公社在抗灾保收，实现继续跃进中发挥了巨大作用，取得了伟大成就。在党的八届八中全会的公报和决议的伟大号召下，全国农村出现了政治情绪高、生产劲头高、劳动效率高、社员出勤多、干部劳动多、先进事例多的“三高三多”的大好形势。
    今年秋收、秋种时间比往年更为紧张，因为：在人民公社化以后，各种作物的播种时间比较集中，秋收的时间也就比较集中。遭受干旱地区，旱象解除后，有的墒情仍然不好，有的还在抗旱保秋；遭受水灾地区，还要排涝，增加了秋收秋种的任务。各地必须克服认为秋收时间长而慢慢来的松劲情绪，动员群众，切实作好三秋工作，坚决把自己辛勤劳动的果实全部拿到手，并且保证适时播种，完成今年秋冬播种计划，为明年夏季更大的丰收打好基础。
    在秋收工作中，一定要做到收好、管好、用好。首先要做到适时收获，颗粒归仓。根据作物成熟先后，分类排队，熟一批，收一批，做到边收、边打、边交售、边运输，要求十成产量十成收，地里长多少，就收回多少，场里打多少，就入仓多少。吸取今年夏收作物精收细打的成功经验，做到地净、场净、路净、秸秆打净，力求地不丢穗，场不丢粒。对于棉花，一定要开一批摘一批，摘净拾净。对于甘薯，事前要准备好储藏窖和切片晒干的工具，保证随收随藏随切晒，不使遭受冻害。对于花生，一定要细收细拣，保证全部收回入仓，防止损失浪费。在秋收工作中不仅要注意大宗作物，而且还要注意收好小宗作物。在秋收工作中，要加强选种工作，精选良种，留足种子。在容易遭受秋雨和早霜为害的地区，还要切实做好防灾准备工作，避免遭受意外损失。
    一切有秋播冬播任务的地方，必须抓紧时间，将播种计划层层落实，一直落实到包产单位，继续推行“三包一奖”和定额管理的制度，把面积、指标、措施迅速落实到队、到组、到田（地块）。保证完成种植任务，按照当地条件，合理安排茬口，力争多种、高产、多收。在完成小麦、油菜种植任务的同时，对于大麦、蚕豆、豌豆等作物也要合理安排，保证种好。特别是对于晚茬地要随收随种，加工施肥，力争早种，并且一般要先远后近，远地先耕先送粪先种，近地后耕后送粪后种，预防三类苗的发生。产麦地区在今年夏、秋之际遭受了长期干旱，有的地方旱情还可能继续下去，影响种麦，少数地区因涝成灾，还要排涝播种，必须树立人定胜天的信念，保证种好，力争不违农时。对于抗旱播种要有充分准备，有灌溉条件的地区，要作好土地平整工作，充分发挥灌溉效能；没有灌溉条件的地区，要强调随耕随耙，做好保墒工作。因时因地制宜全面贯彻“农业八字宪法”，是保证小麦丰收的根本关键。1959年小麦增产经验证明，深耕六寸到一尺左右，每亩施底肥折合标准厩肥五千到一万斤以上，增产效果显著。应该抓紧时机，动员群众，大力开展耕翻麦田和突击施肥运动，去年已经深翻到一尺左右的，可以只进行普耕，不再深翻，去年没有进行深翻的，今年还必须订出具体计划，坚决进行深翻，并且要做到在种麦之前把肥料送到地里，坚决消灭板田播种和白茬下种的现象。要坚决走群众路线，贯彻执行合理密植，既不能过密，又必须克服右倾思想，防止“稀植思想”抬头。秋播种子，应该逐社逐队进行检查，作好余缺调剂工作，备足数量，精选种籽，努力扩大良种面积。在播种前还要做好种籽处理工作，消灭黑穗病，加强对地下害虫的防治工作。
    秋、冬深耕，可以改良土壤，保蓄水分，提高地力，消灭越冬害虫，为明年农业更大丰收打下基础。必须抓紧时间开展秋耕、冬耕和深翻地运动，消灭硬茬（板田）过冬现象。深耕面积要占秋、冬耕面积的50％左右，耕层深度要按不同地区、不同土壤和不同作物提出不同的要求。在深耕中，要充分利用拖拉机、深耕犁实行深耕，拖拉机、深耕犁不足，则采取套犁深耕的办法，提高工效、节省劳力。
    秋收、秋耕、秋种时间紧，农活多，必须根据农活进行排队，统一规划，合理安排劳动力。既要抓住中心，加强主攻战线，又要建立生产责任制度，把专业队的组织和分片包干的生产责任制密切结合起来，不要因为抓住大的而丢了小的。实行按劳分配多劳多得的方针，合理规定劳动定额，开展生产突击手和高工效运动；按照等价互利的原则，组织大协作，互相支援，是解决三秋工作中劳力不足提高工效的有效办法。在秋收秋种的紧张时期，动员机关、部队、学生、辅助劳动力以及暂时可以抽出的人员，参加三秋工作，仍然是必要的。在三秋期间，还要把加工业和副业生产安排好，注意秋季积肥、打草、贮草、秋菜管理等。对秋收、秋耕、秋种的工具要立即进行普遍检查，该修的修，该补的补，缺少的添；晒场、仓库也要有足够的准备。对社员生活要妥善安排，积极办好公共食堂、托儿所等公共福利事业，以便更大地发挥妇女劳动力的作用。为了保证三秋工作胜利完成，必须坚持政治挂帅，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的三秋运动高潮。现在有些地方的晚秋作物还在生长期中，必须根据丰收不到手管理不停止的精神，再接再厉，继续加强后期田间管理，争取最后的丰收。（附图片）
