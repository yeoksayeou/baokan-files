Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening to warmly welcome the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Naim Khan, and the other distinguished Afghan guests accompanying him.

Tonight, the banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was decorated with a fresh new look, brightly lit. At the banquet filled with Sino-Afghan friendship, Premier Zhou Enlai, Deputy Prime Minister Naim, and the Chinese and foreign guests present, all warmly congratulated the continuous development of friendly relations between China and Afghanistan.

Premier Zhou Enlai first delivered a speech at the banquet (full text on page 5), on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to warmly welcome the distinguished Afghan guests from afar. Premier Zhou said in his speech that the Chinese people have been watching the heroic struggle of the Afghan people against colonialism for the sake of maintaining national independence with admiration for the past hundred years. The friendly relations between China and Afghanistan, which have been restored and developed on a new basis since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, have been and are being further strengthened.

The Premier emphasized: "Afghanistan pursues a policy of peace and neutrality in its foreign relations." "Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud and his closest assistant, His Highness Naim, have faithfully implemented this wise policy, setting a good example in the Asian and African regions. Afghanistan has won the respect and praise of the Chinese people and all peace-loving countries and peoples for consistently pursuing this foreign policy which is not only beneficial to its own people but also beneficial to the cause of world peace."

The Premier said in his speech: "Your Highness the Deputy Prime Minister, during your visit to our country, you will have the opportunity to see that the Chinese people, encouraged by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, are continuing to leap forward vigorously, striving to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule this year. You can also see that the rural people's communes are increasingly playing their superior role, and cultural and educational undertakings are also developing vigorously." Premier Zhou concluded: "On the basis of friendly cooperation, close exchange of experience and mutual support between China and Afghanistan will surely help the development of our two countries' construction undertakings."

In his speech (full text on page 5), Deputy Prime Minister Naim expressed the Afghan people's friendship towards the Chinese people. He said: "With admiration and pleasure, our government and people are very interested in watching the great strides your ancient country is making towards progress and prosperity. We wish your great efforts success, and we are pleased and confident in predicting even greater achievements for our great neighbor."

The Deputy Prime Minister said: "In recent years, personal contacts between the leaders of our two countries have further promoted and consolidated our long-standing friendship." Such meetings and contacts will always contribute to the cause of understanding, mutual trust and friendship between countries.

The Deputy Prime Minister reiterated that the Afghan government will always be faithful to the policy of neutrality and the principles of peaceful coexistence. He said: "I am pleased to cite the friendly relations between our two nations as a living example of peaceful cooperation between two countries with different political, economic and social systems." "The painful experience of Asian and African countries over the past two centuries and their struggles and sacrifices for independence are the driving force behind these countries uniting around the principles set forth at the Bandung Conference. These principles have laid a solid foundation for harmony and understanding among countries in the Asian and African regions, and they are a positive asset conducive to the cause of world peace."

The Deputy Prime Minister said: "Our government and the people of Afghanistan believe that the proposed mutual visits between the Soviet Premier and the US President are highly commendable. We sincerely hope that these meetings and direct contacts will lead to a relaxation of tensions and make the prospects for world peace more realistic."

Deputy Prime Minister Naim concluded: "Our experience during our stay in your great country, and our understanding of the achievements you have made in all areas, will be beneficial to us in carrying out the task of developing our economy."

After Premier Zhou Enlai and Deputy Prime Minister Naim spoke, the band played the national anthems of Afghanistan and China in succession.

A reception was held before the banquet. Those who attended the reception and banquet included Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen and Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Siguang, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, our Ambassador to Afghanistan Hao Ting, responsible persons from various departments of our government, people's organizations, democratic parties, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

　　中国政府和人民热烈欢迎远道而来的阿富汗贵宾
　　周总理宴请纳伊姆副首相
    新华社6日讯　周恩来总理今天晚间在北京饭店举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎阿富汗王国副首相兼外交大臣萨达尔·穆罕默德·纳伊姆亲王和随同他来访的其他阿富汗贵宾。
    今晚，北京饭店宴会大厅装饰得焕然一新，灯火辉煌。在充满中阿友谊的宴会上，周恩来总理、纳伊姆副首相以及出席宴会的中外人士，都热烈祝贺中国和阿富汗两国的友好关系不断发展。
    周恩来总理首先在宴会上致词（全文见第五版），代表中国政府和人民热烈欢迎远道而来的阿富汗贵宾。周总理在讲话中说，中国人民近百年来一直怀着敬佩的心情注视着阿富汗人民为维护民族独立反对殖民主义而进行的英勇斗争。中阿两国建交以后在新的基础上恢复和发展起来的友好关系，已经和正在进一步加强起来。
    总理强调说：“阿富汗在对外关系上执行着和平中立的政策”，“萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相和他最亲密的助手纳伊姆殿下忠诚地执行了这一明智的政策，在亚非地区树立了良好的范例。阿富汗因为一贯奉行这种既有利于本国人民又有益于世界和平事业的对外政策而赢得了中国人民和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的尊敬和赞扬。”
    总理在讲话中说：“副首相殿下，你在访问我国期间将有机会看到，中国人民在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下和在1958年大跃进的基础上，正在轰轰烈烈地继续跃进，为在今年内提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而努力。你还可以看到，农村人民公社正在日益发挥它的优越作用，文化教育事业也在蓬勃地发展。”周总理最后说：“中阿两国在友好合作的基础上，密切地交流经验、互相支援，必将有助于我们两国建设事业的发展。”
    纳伊姆副首相在讲话（全文见第五版）中表达了阿富汗人民对中国人民的友谊。他说：“我国政府和人民以钦佩和愉快的心情，很感兴趣地注视着你们这个历史悠久的国家正在向进步和繁荣迈进的巨大的步伐。我们祝你们的伟大努力得到成功，并且以愉快的心情和信心预祝伟大邻国的更加伟大的成就。”
    副首相说：“最近几年来，我们两国领导人之间的个人接触进一步推动和巩固了我们的悠久的友谊。”这种会见和接触将始终有助于各国间的了解、互信和友好的事业。
    副首相重申阿富汗政府将始终忠于中立政策与和平共处的原则。他说：“我很愉快地援引存在于我们两国之间的友好关系，作为具有不同政治、经济和社会制度的两个国家和平合作的活的榜样。”“过去两个世纪来亚非国家的痛苦经历和它们为争取独立而进行的斗争和付出的牺牲，是推动这些国家团结在万隆会议所制订的原则周围的动力。这些原则为亚非地区各国之间的和谐和了解奠定了巩固的基础，它们是有利于全世界和平事业的积极的财富。”
    副首相说：“我国政府和阿富汗人民认为，建议中的苏联总理和美国总统之间的相互访问是十分值得赞扬的事。我们诚挚地希望这些会见和直接接触将导致紧张局势的和缓，并使世界和平的前景更为现实。”
    纳伊姆副首相最后说：“我们在你们伟大的国家里逗留期间的经历，以及对你们在各方面所取得的成就的了解，对于我们自己执行发展经济的任务将是有益的。”
    周恩来总理和纳伊姆副首相讲话以后，乐队先后高奏阿富汗和中国国歌。
    宴会以前举行了酒会。参加酒会和宴会的，有国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅、全国人民代表大会常委会副委员长李济深、沈钧儒，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，外交部副部长章汉夫，我国驻阿富汗大使郝汀，我国政府各部门、人民团体、民主党派的负责人，人民解放军高级将领和首都各界人士。
