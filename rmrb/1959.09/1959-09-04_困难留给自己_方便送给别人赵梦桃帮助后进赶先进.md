Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 2nd: Zhao Mengtao, a national advanced producer and a female worker in the fine yarn workshop of Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, has helped twelve female workers become advanced producers of the factory and workshop in the past six years. These female workers, in turn, have taken Zhao Mengtao's spirit of selfless devotion as an example and passed on the advanced experience they learned from Zhao Mengtao to others. Now, this factory has a total of 207 advanced collectives and individuals, all of whom are learning Zhao Mengtao's communist style, trying every possible way to motivate the backward groups and workers around them, and a competition movement of advanced helping backward, and backward catching up with advanced is being launched throughout the factory.

Zhao Mengtao is a representative of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. From May 1952 to now, she has comprehensively completed the state plan month after month for seven years. Since the beginning of this year, she has been comprehensively overfulfilling the state plan every day. In these years, she has saved more than 1,200 kilograms of cotton alone.

Zhao Mengtao began to help backward workers progress six years ago. At that time, she saw that although her own production performance was very good, the other nine members of her group often failed to complete the state plan. She remembered what the Party Branch Secretary told her when she joined the Party: It is the responsibility and obligation of a Communist Party member to help the masses advance together with oneself. Therefore, she, together with the Communist Party members in the group, found that the key to other members not being able to complete the plan was slow yarn joining and too many slubs. She then decided to pass on the advanced yarn joining experience she had learned from others to other female workers as soon as possible. With her help, Zhai Fulan's yarn joining speed increased from 12 per minute to 20, catching up with her own. Zhai Fulan immediately passed it on to the new female worker Niu Lingling. Niu Lingling also caught up with the advanced level and was named an advanced producer in the factory. In this way, they passed it on one by one, and the advanced yarn joining experience was quickly mastered by the group members, with the average yarn joining speed increasing from eight to sixteen per minute, greatly improving production efficiency.

Zhao Mengtao always leaves the difficulties to herself and offers convenience to others. Once, the workshop director transferred a female worker to her group. This female worker was not wanted by several groups because of her low skills. At that time, some group members were unwilling, but Zhao Mengtao persuaded everyone and mobilized everyone to help the new female worker together. The female worker Tang Saijuan was a novice, and the machine she was watching lacked a collector, with a lot of yarn breakage and fly waste. She had to produce at least seven or eighty taels of white waste a day, failing to complete the task of saving cotton. Seeing that Tang Saijuan had difficulties, Zhao Mengtao took the initiative to exchange machines with her. At that time, Zhao Mengtao had just issued a challenge to others at the Shaanxi Provincial Advanced Producers Conference, and some people advised her not to exchange machines, lest she fail to achieve the challenge target. Zhao Mengtao replied seriously that what a Communist Party member wants is not personal "reputation," but to lead the masses to advance together for the cause of the Party and for the interests of the Party. In this way, she did not care about personal fame and gain, and time and time again left her own machine to work on the machine that people considered the most difficult. Since the beginning of this year, Zhao Mengtao has exchanged machines with others seven times.

Because Zhao Mengtao's group vigorously promoted the style of advanced helping backward, one backward worker after another has become an advanced producer. For six consecutive years, the whole group has overfulfilled the state plan; for six consecutive years, this group has been selected as the factory's model production group.

Zhao Mengtao not only tried her best to help the members of her own group, but also tried her best to help the members of other groups to progress. In May of this year, the third group failed to complete the state plan, and the group members were all shouting that the machine was not good. Zhao Mengtao then requested the Party Branch to let her go to try exchanging machines. According to the instructions of the Party Branch, she worked on the machine in the third group that was considered "the ugliest." She concentrated all her attention, repaired the machine in time, and did a good job in cleaning, and as a result, she produced half as much white waste as Meng Yindi, the original shift worker with higher skills, and overfulfilled the daily production task. At this point, the members of the third group all realized that whether the plan could be completed was determined by people, not machines. The whole group was motivated, and completed the state plan in June, July, and August. After the third group jumped to become an advanced group, they immediately helped other groups overcome difficulties, improve technology, and advance together.

Zhao Mengtao's spirit of selfless communist devotion has had a tremendous impact on the factory and has become a model for the majority of workers to learn from. Recently, Liu Xiaobian, Zhang Xiufang and other thirty-seven advanced producers in the factory jointly initiated a proposal, expressing their willingness to actively help others to progress like Zhao Mengtao, complete the production tasks for the third quarter ahead of schedule, and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day. This proposal has been responded to by advanced producers throughout the factory. (Attached picture)

    困难留给自己
  　方便送给别人赵梦桃帮助后进赶先进
    新华社西安2日电　全国先进生产者、西北国棉一厂细纱值车女工赵梦桃，六年来先后帮助十二个女工成为厂的、车间的先进生产者。这些女工又以赵梦桃大公无私的精神为榜样，把从赵梦桃那里学到的先进经验传授给别人。现在，这个厂共有二百零七个先进集体和个人，都学习赵梦桃的共产主义风格，千方百计地把自己周围的后进小组和工人都带动起来，全厂掀起了先进帮后进，后进赶先进的竞赛运动。
    赵梦桃是中国共产党第八次全国代表大会代表。从1952年5月到现在，她七年如一日，月月全面地完成国家计划，今年以来，更是日日全面地超额完成国家计划。她在这几年中，仅节约的棉花就有一千二百多公斤。
  赵梦桃在六年前就开始帮助后进的工人进步。当时她看到，虽然她自己的生产成绩很好，但她所在小组的其他九个组员，往往不能完成国家计划。她想起了入党时党总支书记对她说的话：帮助群众同自己一道前进，是共产党员的责任和义务。于是，她就同组里的共产党员一起，找到了其他组员完不成计划的关键是接头慢、疙瘩多。她便决定把自己从别人那里学到的先进接头经验，尽快地传授给其他女工。在她的帮助下，女工翟福兰每分钟接头从原来的十二个提高到二十个，赶上了她自己。翟福兰又马上传授给新女工牛玲玲。牛玲玲也接着赶上了先进水平，被评为厂里的先进生产者。这样，她们一个传授一个，先进的接头经验很快就被组员们掌握住，每人每分钟接头平均由八个提高到十六个，大大地提高了生产效率。
    赵梦桃总是把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人。有一次，车间主任给她所在的小组调来一位女工，这位女工因为技术不高，好几个小组都不要。当时有些组员不愿意，赵梦桃就说服大家，并且发动大家共同帮助这位新来的女工。女工唐赛娟是个生手，看的车子又缺乏集合器，断头、飞花特别多，一天至少要出七、八十两白花，完不成节约棉花的任务。赵梦桃看到唐赛娟有困难，就主动同她换车。当时赵梦桃刚在陕西省先进生产者会议上向别人提出了挑战，有人就劝她不要换车，以免实现不了挑战的指标。赵梦桃严肃地回答说，一个共产党员要的不是个人的“名声”，而是要为党的事业、为党的利益带领群众共同前进。她就这样不计较个人的名利得失，一次又一次地离开自己的车子，到被人们认为最困难的车子上去工作。今年以来，赵梦桃已经七次同别人换车。
    由于赵梦桃所在的小组大兴先进帮助后进之风，后进的一个个都变为先进生产者。接连六年，全组都超额完成国家计划；接连六年，这个组都被选为厂里的模范生产小组。
    赵梦桃不但竭力帮助本组组员，还尽力帮助其他组的组员前进。今年5月间，第三组完不成国家计划，组员们都叫喊车子不好。赵梦桃便请求党支部让她前去换车试一试。她根据党支部的指示，到三组一部被认为“最难看的车子”上工作。她全神贯注，及时检修车子，清洁工作又做得好，结果第一天就比技术较高的原值车工孟银弟少出一半白花，超额完成了当日的生产任务。这一下，第三组的组员们都认识到：计划能不能完成，决定的是人，而不是机器。全组一个个鼓起干劲，6、7、8月份中都接连完成了国家计划。第三组一跃而为先进组后，又立即帮助其他组克服困难，改进技术，共同前进。
    赵梦桃这种大公无私的共产主义精神，在这个厂发生了巨大影响，成了广大职工学习的榜样。最近，这个工厂刘小变、张秀芳等三十七名先进生产者联合发起倡议，表示要像赵梦桃那样主动地去帮助别人进步，提前完成第三季度的生产任务，迎接国庆十周年。这个倡议得到了全厂先进生产者的响应。（附图片）
