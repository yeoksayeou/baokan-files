    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council

    Instructions on Launching a Mass Short-Distance Transportation Campaign

    (1) Currently, a new high tide of industrial production, transportation, and capital construction has arrived. In the coming months, the quantity of raw materials, materials, and fuels required for production and construction will increase substantially. The quantity of agricultural and sideline products supplied by rural areas to cities and export goods, as well as industrial products supplied by cities to rural areas, is also very large. The transportation of coal for civilian use in winter must also be completed in the coming months. At the same time, it is necessary to store and transport necessary materials early for production and construction next spring. The above-mentioned material transportation tasks are very heavy, and a considerable part of them must go through a process of short-distance collection and distribution. According to preliminary estimates by the Ministry of Communications, the volume of materials transported through short-distance transportation in the fourth quarter of this year will increase by about 70% compared to the third quarter. Such a large volume of transportation is difficult to complete relying solely on the existing transportation capacity of the transportation departments. Therefore, it has become an important task in current economic work to plan and mobilize the broad masses to quickly launch a vigorous mass movement for short-distance transportation.

    (2) Utilizing agricultural gaps to engage in transportation work has always been an important sideline production in rural areas of our country. After the people's communes, relying on the further organized masses to vigorously develop short-distance transportation has more favorable conditions. However, the current time is the busy season for autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing. In autumn and winter, large-scale afforestation, water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and various sideline productions will also be carried out, and these tasks are required to be done more and better than in previous years. Therefore, it is necessary to properly arrange rural labor and rationally arrange short-distance transportation tasks. In terms of labor arrangement, it is necessary to take into account the needs of industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce. It is necessary to ensure that the "Three Autumns" work and agricultural production and construction work are done well, and it is also necessary to ensure the transportation needs of industrial production, capital construction, and materials for living services. Mobilizing farmers to participate in transportation work should adopt the principle of doing more in slack seasons, doing less in busy seasons, and doing a lot after autumn. Local party committees and people's committees should, according to the size of local short-distance transportation tasks and the order of agricultural seasons, conduct comprehensive planning and rational allocation of rural labor, livestock, and transportation tools. In terms of the arrangement of transportation tasks, first, it is necessary to do a good job in the transportation of coal, ore, pig iron, timber, grain, capital construction materials, and fresh and perishable commodities to ensure the overfulfillment of the annual leap forward plan. The most important of these is the transportation of coal. It is necessary to transport the approximately 13 million tons of coal accumulated within 30 kilometers of the railway line to the railway line, stations, and ports as soon as possible. Each region should, according to its specific circumstances, do a good job in queuing up material transportation under the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of general needs.

    (3) All localities should, in the spirit of self-reliance, obtain materials locally to repair and supplement various transportation tools; and vigorously carry out technological innovation and promote advanced experience. Promote the use of various simple transportation tools and equipment according to local conditions. In plain areas and relatively flat sections, car-based and rail-based transportation should be implemented as much as possible. Wherever rivers are accessible, river channels should be actively improved to achieve ship-based transportation as much as possible. In mountainous areas, hilly areas, and areas where slopes can be used, cableways and chutes should be implemented as much as possible to save labor and reduce labor intensity. These should be solved realistically by all localities in consultation with the masses based on local conditions and the experience of the masses.

    In addition, the automobiles, tractors, trailers, rubber-tired vehicles, and ships of various agencies, enterprises, people's organizations, troops, schools, and other units should be fully organized and utilized to give full play to the potential of these transportation tools.

    (4) Conscientiously implement the principle of payment according to work and payment of freight. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should reasonably stipulate the range of freight rates and regional freight differences based on local conditions. It is necessary to ensure reasonable income for the masses and prevent blindly raising freight rates. Freight must be settled in a timely manner and paid as soon as it is transported. All localities should also pay attention to implementing appropriate reward systems to encourage the broad masses to participate in short-distance transportation.

    Care for the lives of the masses. Due to the increased physical exertion of personnel participating in short-distance transportation, it is necessary to appropriately increase grain rations, which should be resolved by local governments based on local conditions. The needs of transportation personnel in terms of accommodation, food, and medicine must be properly arranged. Livestock participating in transportation must be taken care of, and the supply of fodder must be effectively guaranteed.

    (5) Local party committees and people's committees should immediately start making various preparations, conduct political mobilization among the masses; organize professional and sideline transportation teams based on production teams within the people's communes according to needs and possibilities; establish and improve transportation command headquarters at all levels; prepare transportation plans; build and maintain roads; repair and manufacture tools; set up transportation stations, etc., so as to immediately start large-scale transportation work after the autumn harvest. At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the gaps during the autumn harvest, extract a certain amount of strength, and rush to transport a batch of materials.

    In order to smoothly carry out the mass movement of short-distance transportation and ensure the completion of the short-distance transportation tasks, party committees and people's committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over this movement, assign special personnel to be responsible, and use the transportation command headquarters at all levels as unified command institutions, and strengthen cooperation with all relevant parties. Transportation command headquarters at all levels must strengthen transportation organization work, do a good job in rational transportation and incidental transportation, strengthen on-site command and management, and coordinate long-distance and short-distance, and coordinate transportation and loading and unloading to fully exert transportation efficiency, avoid wasting transportation power, and pay attention to transportation safety.

    中共中央　国务院
    关于开展群众短途运输运动的指示
      （一）目前，工业生产、交通运输和基本建设的新高潮已经到来。今后几个月生产建设所需的原料、材料、燃料的数量将大量增加；由农村供应城市的农副产品和出口物资，由城市供应农村的工业产品，数量都很大；冬季民用煤的运输也要在今后几个月内完成，同时，还要为明春的生产和建设及早贮运必需的物资。上述物资的运输任务十分繁重，其中有相当大的一部分要经过一个短途集散的过程。据交通部初步估计，今年第四季度通过短途运输的物资运输量将比第三季度增长百分之七十左右。这样大的运输量只靠运输部门现有的运力是难以完成的。因此有计划地组织和动员广大群众，迅速开展一个轰轰烈烈的短途运输的群众运动，就成为当前经济工作中的一项重要任务。
    （二）利用农事间隙从事运输工作，向来是我国农村一项重要的副业生产。人民公社化以后，依靠进一步组织起来了的群众，大办短途运输，就有了更加有利的条件。但是目前正是秋收、秋种、秋耕的农忙季节，秋冬还要进行大规模造林、兴修水利、积肥以及各种副业生产，而这些方面的工作都要求比往年做得又多又好。为此，就必须妥善地安排农村劳动力，和合理安排短途运输任务。在劳动力的安排方面，必须同时兼顾工、农、交、商各方面的需要。既要保证将三秋工作和农业生产建设工作做好；又要保证工业生产、基本建设以及为生活服务的物资运输的需要。动员农民参加运输工作，应当采取农闲多搞、农忙少搞、秋后大搞的原则，由各地党委和人民委员会根据当地短途运输任务的大小和农事季节的先后，对农村劳动力、畜力和运输工具进行全面规划、合理调配。在运输任务的安排方面，首先是搞好煤炭、矿石、生铁、木材、粮食、基建材料及不易保管的鲜活商品的运输，以保证全年跃进计划的超额完成。其中最主要的是煤炭的运输，必须尽可能先把积存在离铁路线三十公里以内的大约一千三百万吨煤炭搬运到铁路沿线、车站和港口。各地区应当根据当地具体情况，在保证重点、照顾一般的原则下，做好物资运输的排队工作。
    （三）各地应当本着自力更生的精神，就地取材，修复和补充各种运输工具；并且大力开展技术革新；推广先进经验。因地制宜地推广使用各种简易的运输工具和设备，在平原地区和较平坦地段应当尽可能地实行车子化和轨道化；凡有河流可通的地方，应当积极整治河道，尽可能地实现船运化；在山区、丘陵地带以及有坡度可利用的地方，应当尽可能地实行索道化和溜槽化，以节约劳动力和减轻劳动强度。这些，各地应当根据当地具体条件和群众的经验，同群众商量，实事求是地解决。
    此外，各机关、企业、人民团体、部队、学校等单位的汽车、拖拉机、挂车、胶轮车、船舶等都应当充分加以组织利用，发挥这些运输工具的潜力。
    （四）认真贯彻执行按劳付酬、支付运费的原则。各省市、自治区对运价幅度和地区运价差额等，应当根据当地具体情况合理地加以规定。既要保证群众合理收入，也要防止盲目抬高运价。运费必须及时结算，随运随付。各地还应当注意实行适当的奖励制度，以鼓励广大群众参加短途运输的积极性。
    要关心群众生活。参加短途运输的人员由于体力消耗增加，需要适当提高粮食定量，各地应当根据当地的具体情况予以解决；对运输人员的住宿、饮食、医药等方面的需要必须作妥善安排。对于参加运输的牲畜必须注意爱护，草料的供应必须切实保证。
    （五）各地党委和人民委员会应当立即着手做好各项准备，在群众中进行政治动员工作；根据需要和可能在人民公社内组织好以生产队为基础的专业和副业运输队；建立和健全各级运输指挥部；编制运输计划；修建和养护道路；修理和制造工具；设置运输站等等，以便在秋收以后立即开始大规模的运输工作。同时，还必须抓紧秋收期间的空隙，抽出一定的力量，赶运一批物资。
    为了顺利地开展短途运输的群众运动，保证短途运输任务的完成，各级党委和人民委员会必须加强对这一运动的领导，指定专人负责，以各级运输指挥部作为统一指挥的机构，并加强和各有关方面的协作。各级运输指挥部，都要加强运输组织工作，搞好合理运输和捎脚运输，加强现场指挥管理，并且使长途和短途衔接，运输和装卸配合，以充分发挥运输效率，避免浪费运输力量，并且注意运输安全。
                                      一九五九年九月二十五日
