Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 25th: The modern large-scale Matou Coal Washery, with an annual raw coal washing capacity of 2 million tons, was completed and officially put into production on the 24th of this month, three months ahead of schedule. After rigorous inspection and testing by the State Acceptance Committee, the machines were found to be operating well and the quality was rated as excellent.

The completion and commissioning of the Matou Coal Washery provides more favorable conditions for improving the output and quality of steel. In the fourth quarter of this year, it will wash 150,000 tons of high-quality refined coal for the steel industry.

The Matou Coal Washery is one of the key projects aided by the Soviet Union in China. The total area of the plant is more than 172,000 square meters. The main plant building is 130.5 meters long, 24 meters wide, and 42.5 meters high, and is a multi-story reinforced concrete structure. The main coal washing equipment is manufactured in the Soviet Union and is the latest type. The entire production process, from raw coal entering the plant, coal extraction, transportation, hoisting, crushing, and washing, to refined coal leaving the plant, is fully mechanized and automated. The operation of nearly 500 main machines in the plant is uniformly controlled remotely by the central dispatch room. The main machinery and equipment are equipped with automatic controllers, which will automatically stop operating in the event of mechanical or electrical failures. The plant also has a complete ventilation, dust removal system, and protection devices, enabling workers to produce safely.

The Matou Coal Washery is built in the Fengfeng Coal Mine, which is famous for producing prime coking coal in China. It will provide more than 1 million tons of high-quality refined coal with low ash content to the steel industry every year. The refined coal recovery rate will be as high as about 60%. At the same time, it can also select the gangue contained in the raw coal of the Fengfeng Coal Mine, avoiding them from making useless "travels."

From the selection of the plant site and design to the complete construction, Soviet experts have provided assistance. In the construction process, Soviet experts put forward more than 700 suggestions, which played a great role in accelerating the construction speed and saving funds.

The Matou Coal Washery Engineering Department, which undertook the construction task of this plant, under the leadership of the Party, insisted on launching a mass movement and overcame many difficulties in raw materials, materials and technology. In the past two years, the masses of employees have put forward more than 40,000 rationalization proposals around the key to production, which greatly accelerated the progress of the project.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th: Shanghai's new modern large-scale coking oven—the No. 1 coking oven of the Wujing Coking and Gas Plant—has been completed and put into production on the 23rd. According to the design, the annual output of this coking oven will be 450,000 tons, which is more than the total output of coke in Shanghai from January to August this year.

The Wujing Coking and Gas Plant is one of the large-scale coking plants in the country that comprehensively utilizes raw coal, and is planned to be built in two phases. The completed first phase of the project, in addition to producing coke, can also output 470,000 cubic meters of gas per day for the needs of steel, machinery, electronics and civilian use. This figure is equivalent to the current total gas production of Shanghai. In addition, it can also extract many important chemical products such as coal tar and crude benzene.

    马头洗选厂提前三月投入生产
    上海新建大型焦化厂的现代化炼焦炉已建成
    新华社邯郸25日电　年洗原煤二百万吨的现代化大型洗选厂——马头洗选厂，在本月24日提前三个月建成并正式投入生产。经过国家验收委员会严格的检查试验，证明机器运转良好，质量评为优等。
    马头洗选厂的建成投入生产，为提高钢铁产量质量提供了更有利的条件，今年第四季度它就能为钢铁工业洗选十五万吨优质精煤。
    马头洗选厂是苏联帮助我国建设的重点工程之一。全厂总面积达十七万二千多平方米，主厂房长一百三十点五米、宽二十四米、高四十二点五米，是个多层钢筋混凝土结构的建筑物。主要洗煤设备是苏联制造的，而且都是最新式的。整个生产过程从原煤进厂、取煤、运输、提升、破碎和洗选，直到精煤出厂，全部机械化和自动化。全厂近五百台主要机械的运转，都由中央调度室统一远距离操纵。主要机器设备上装有自动控制器，机械、电气发生故障，就会自动停止运转。厂内还有完善的通风、除尘系统和保护装置，工人能够安全生产。
    马头洗选厂建设在我国以产主焦煤著名的峰峰煤矿，它每年将为钢铁工业提供一百多万吨灰分低的优质精煤，精煤回收率将高达60％左右。同时，它还可以把峰峰煤矿原煤中所含的?石选出，避免它们作无益的“旅行”。
    这座洗选厂从厂址选择、设计直到全部建成，苏联专家都给以帮助。在建设过程中，苏联专家共提出了七百多项建议，对于加快建设速度、节省资金起了很大作用。
    承担这座厂建设任务的马头洗选厂工程处，在党的领导下，坚持大搞群众运动，克服了很多原料、材料和技术方面的困难。两年来，职工群众围绕生产关键提出了四万多件合理化建议，大大加速了工程的进度。
    据新华社上海25日电　上海新建的现代化大型炼焦炉—吴泾炼焦制气厂一号焦炉已经建成，在23日投入生产。根据设计，这座焦炉年产量将为四十五万吨，比上海全市今年1月到8月的焦炭总产量还多。
    吴泾炼焦制气厂是全国综合利用原煤的大型焦化厂之一，计划分两期建设。已经完工的第一期工程，除生产焦炭外，每天还可以输出四十七万立方米的煤气，供钢铁、机电和民用需要，这个数字相当于目前上海全市煤气产量的总和。此外还可以提炼焦油、粗苯等许多重要的化工产品。
