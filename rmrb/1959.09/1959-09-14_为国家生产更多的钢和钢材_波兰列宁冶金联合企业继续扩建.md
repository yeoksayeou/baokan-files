To Produce More Steel and Steel Materials for the Country
The Lenin Steelworks Combine Continues to Expand

    Warsaw, September 13th (By this newspaper) - The second phase of construction has begun at Poland's largest Nowa Huta Lenin Steelworks Combine. For the ten years since its establishment, this enterprise has been one of the key construction projects in the country. To date, the entire plant has completed six coke ovens, three large blast furnaces, seven large open-hearth furnaces, two large steel plate rolling workshops, as well as many auxiliary workshops and satellite factories. This year, the Lenin Steelworks Combine can produce 1.37 million tons of steel for the country, basically reaching the designed level of 1.5 million tons of steel in the first phase of production. Now, with the exception of some workshops that are still under construction, the first phase of construction projects has basically been completed, and the second phase of expansion of the Lenin Steelworks Combine began this year.
    The continued expansion of the Lenin Steelworks Combine was decided by the Polish government in 1957. In this phase, six more coke ovens, two blast furnaces, and two open-hearth furnaces will be newly built. These two open-hearth furnaces will be completed in 1960 and 1962 respectively. It is also necessary to build a steelmaking plant equipped with ninety-ton converters, a factory for producing industrial oxygen, and a steel wire factory. Some of these projects have already started, and some are about to start construction one after another. There are currently more than 20 construction projects underway. The entire second-phase expansion project will be completed by 1965. Upon completion, the production capacity of this enterprise can be increased to an annual output of 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel. At that time, the steel output of the Lenin Steelworks Combine will account for one-third of the country's steel output. This magnificent expansion plan inspires more than 15,000 employees and builders throughout the plant, who are working hard on a huge iron and steel industrial enterprise covering an area of 1,000 hectares. Poland's national industrial enterprises are also vigorously supporting the expansion project of the Lenin Steelworks Combine. According to the agreement reached between Poland and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union continues to provide assistance for the expansion of the Lenin Steelworks Combine.

    为国家生产更多的钢和钢材
    波兰列宁冶金联合企业继续扩建
    本报华沙13日电　波兰最大的诺瓦·胡特列宁冶金联合企业开始了第二阶段的建设工程。自建厂以来的十年间，这个企业一直是全国的重点建设工程之一，迄今为止，全厂已建成了六座炼焦炉，三座大高炉，七座大平炉，两座大型钢板压延车间以及许多辅助性车间和卫星厂。今年列宁冶金企业可为国家生产一百三十七万吨钢，基本上达到了第一阶段生产一百五十万吨钢的设计水平。现在除部分车间仍在继续施工外，第一阶段的建设项目基本结束，今年已经开始了列宁冶金企业建设第二阶段的扩建工程。
    继续扩建列宁冶金企业是波兰政府1957年决定的，在这一阶段将再新建六座炼焦炉，两座高炉，两座平炉，这两座平炉将分别于1960年和1962年竣工；还要建设装备有九十吨回转炉的炼钢厂，生产工业用氧气的工厂和钢丝厂等，这些工程项目有些已经动工，有的即将陆续动工破土，目前施工的项目共有二十多个。整个第二期扩建工程要到1965年结束，完工后，可使这个企业的生产能力提高到年产三百到三百五十万吨钢。那时，列宁冶金企业的钢产量将占全国钢产量的三分之一。这一宏伟的扩建计划鼓舞着全厂一万五千多名职工和建设者，他们正在占地一千公顷的巨大钢铁工业企业上紧张地进行建设。波兰全国的工业企业也在大力支援列宁冶金企业的扩建工程，根据波兰同苏联达成的协议，苏联继续为列宁冶金企业的扩建提供援助。
