Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 27th: China's first modern rayon factory, the Baoding Chemical Fiber Complex, has partially put into operation its main projects, including the raw material workshop for producing ordinary rayon, the spinning workshop, and the textile finishing workshop. It has already produced more than 30 tons of bright, white, and soft rayon as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The Baoding Chemical Fiber Complex will make full use of China's abundant resources of fish-scale pine and cotton linters as raw materials to produce large quantities of high-quality rayon, in order to meet the needs of the people's ever-improving lives. According to the design, this factory will produce two kinds of products: ordinary rayon and high-tenacity rayon. High-grade silk woven from ordinary rayon is soft, durable, and brightly colored, comparable to natural silk, but the price is more than half cheaper than natural silk. High-tenacity rayon has a wide range of industrial uses, and can be woven into tire cord fabrics for automobile tires, transmission belts, conveyor belts, etc. It has stronger tensile strength, heat resistance, and wear resistance than tire cord fabrics woven from cotton yarn, and can also save rubber.

This chemical fiber complex is large in scale, covering an area of approximately 600,000 square meters. All the equipment is the latest type of machinery manufactured in the German Democratic Republic. The entire production process is mechanized and has good automatic control equipment.

During the construction of this factory, it received full technical assistance from the German Democratic Republic. From the selection of the factory site to the start of construction, the German Democratic Republic sent experts to provide specific assistance. In the course of construction, it also trained a large number of technicians and skilled workers for our country.

The Baoding Chemical Fiber Complex began construction in October 1957. The entire project is divided into two phases. The first phase will be fully completed and put into production in the first half of next year, and the second phase will also begin construction next year.

    我国第一座人造丝工厂
    保定化学纤维厂部分建成
    兴建过程中得到德意志民主共和国的援助
    新华社天津27日电　我国第一座现代化人造丝工厂——保定化学纤维联合厂，第一期生产普通人造丝的原液车间和纺丝、纺织整理车间等主体工程在最近部分投入生产，并且已经生产出三十多吨色泽光亮洁白、质地柔软的人造丝，向建国十周年献礼。
    保定化学纤维联合厂将充分利用我国盛产的鱼鳞松等木材和棉籽短绒作原料，大量生产质地优良的人造丝，以适应广大人民生活日益提高的需要。按照设计，这个厂生产普通人造丝和强力人造丝两种产品。用普通人造丝织成的高级丝绸，柔软耐用，色泽鲜艳，可以同天然丝绸媲美，而价钱却比天然丝绸便宜一半多。强力人造丝在工业上有广泛的用途，可以织成做汽车轮胎、传动带、运输带等用的帘子布，它比用棉纱织成的帘子布拉力强，耐热耐磨，还可以节约橡胶。
    这座化学纤维联合厂规模宏大，占地面积约六十万平方米，全部设备都是德意志民主共和国制造的最新型的机器；整个生产过程都是机械化的，而且有良好的自动控制设备。
    这个厂在兴建过程中，得到德意志民主共和国的全面技术援助。从厂址的选择到动工兴建，德意志民主共和国都派来专家进行具体帮助。在建设过程中，还为我国培养训练了不少技术人员和技术工人。
    保定化学纤维联合厂是1957年10月动工兴建的；全部工程分两期进行，第一期工程将在明年上半年全部建成投入生产，第二期工程也将在明年开始施工。
