The British "Times" Deceives Itself
    Doing Its Utmost to Slander China's Great Leap Forward, Shouting that Britain Doesn't Need to Worry and Can Take a Breather

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The London "Times" published an editorial on August 27th entitled "Beware Your Leap Forward." The full text is as follows:

    China's leaders have finally come down from the mountains and admitted a number of startling facts. The stars of steel, coal, grain, and cotton production, which were originally intended to shine brightly in this year's tenth anniversary of the founding of the new Chinese government, have dimmed. The communique strives to claim that everything is progress and unity, but the facts it reveals are almost a 180-degree turn. To cover this up, the communique suddenly drops the curtain on the Second Five-Year Plan and declares that the targets set by this plan will be completed this year, or at the latest next year. The targets may be achievable, but this is the Second Five-Year Plan that was deemed too unambitious and virtually shelved when the "Great Leap Forward" began last year. The communique can announce that the Great Leap Forward will continue: the figures it cites, however, are a great retreat. First of all, there are these admissions. Last year's production figures were "somewhat on the high side." (Are the Chinese also trying to catch up with the British in understatement?) The 375 million tons of grain that were widely publicized in 1958 have become only 250 million tons. Of the 11 million tons of steel, only 8 million tons were for industrial use. Cotton production was also overestimated. Although coal figures have not been released, the coal dug out by the communes in the rush may also contain a large amount of waste.

    It is necessary and wise to admit all this, even if it is shameful, even if the fig leaf is only a veil that is too thin to cover anything. In fact, the communes are still a new social and economic structure. But the Great Leap Forward as a way to rapidly increase production now seems clumsy. Those who were scorned in the spring of 1958 for advocating steady progress rather than a spectacular advance have triumphantly proven themselves correct. Therefore, this year's targets have been drastically reduced. Steel has been reduced from 18 million tons to 12 million tons; coal from 380 million tons to 335 million tons; as for the other two main products—grain and cotton—the Central Committee is simply unwilling to trouble itself with numbers.

    As a result, the goal of catching up with Britain, which was originally set at fifteen years in 1957, was reduced to just a few years in the wave of frenzy last autumn, and is now cautiously shrunk back to ten years. We can take a breather and not have to worry for the time being about that dragon chasing closely behind us. Apart from this vaguely announced reduction in statistics, the communique has nothing else to say. Originally, the communes were still advancing steadily. Now, the only danger is "right-leaning opportunism" within the Party, that is, danger from those who doubt the value of the communes and the spirit that originally sought to form the Great Leap Forward. Although these demands are made to "certain cadres," it is clear that members of the Central Committee are included. There may be more to see in this theoretical debate later!

### 英“泰晤士报”自欺欺人  对我国的大跃进亟尽诬蔑之能事  大叫英国不必担心可以歇一口气

    英“泰晤士报”自欺欺人
    对我国的大跃进亟尽诬蔑之能事  大叫英国不必担心可以歇一口气
    本报讯　伦敦“泰晤士报”8月27日发表了一篇题为“当心你们的跃进吧”的社论。全文如下：
    中国的领袖们终于从高山上走下来，满口招认了许多惊人的事实。本来要在今年中国新政府成立十周年大放光明的钢、煤、粮、棉生产的明星，已经黯淡无光了。公报竭力声称一切都是进步和团结的，但是它所透露的事实却差不多等于是一种一百八十度的转变。为了掩饰这一点，公报突然放下第二个五年计划这张幕布，并且宣称这个计划所规定的目标将在今年、至迟在明年完成。目标也许是可以完成的，但是这却是那个在去年“大跃进”开始的时候被认为是太不进取因而实际上被搁在一边的第二个五年计划。公报可以宣布大跃进仍要继续：它所引用的数字却是一个大跃退。首先就是这些招认。去年的生产数字原来是“有些偏高的”。（难道中国人在说话打折扣方面也想赶上英国人吗？）1958年大肆宣扬的三亿七千五百万吨粮食变成了仅仅二亿五千万吨。在一千一百万吨钢中只有八百万吨是工业用钢。棉花的生产也是估计过高。煤的数字虽然没有发表，但是公社生产队在忙乱中挖出的煤里面也许也包含大量的废物。
    承认这一切是必要的、明智的，即使这是丢脸的，即使遮羞的幕布只不过是一层薄得不能再薄的纱。事实上，公社仍旧是一个新的社会和经济结构。可是以大跃进作为迅速增加生产的方法，现在看来是笨拙的。在1958年春天遭到蔑视的主张稳步前进而不要轰轰烈烈前进的人们已经得意地证明了自己的正确。因此今年的指标一下子降低了。钢从一千八百万吨降到一千二百万吨；煤从三亿八千万吨降到三亿三千五百万吨；至于另外两项主要产品——粮和棉——中央委员会根本不愿意用数字来给自己找麻烦。
    结果是，赶上英国的目标最初在1957年订为十五年，在去年秋天的狂热浪潮中减少到不过几年，而现在又谨慎地缩回到十年了。我们可以歇一口气，暂且不必担心那条龙在我们身后紧紧追赶了。公报除了这种含混宣布的降低统计数字之外，没有谈出什么东西。原来公社仍然在稳步前进。现在唯一的危险是党内的“右倾机会主义”，这就是说来自那些怀疑公社的价值和原来大跃进企图形成的精神的人们的危险。虽然这些要求是向“某些干部”提出的，可是显然中央委员会的委员是包括在其中的。关于这场理论性的辩论，以后可能还有戏看呢！
