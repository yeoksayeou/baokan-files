The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party used "the rising sun" to describe people's communes. This is truly the best and most fitting metaphor! The sun shines on everything. Without the power of the sun's light and heat, nothing can grow. For over 500 million Chinese farmers, the emergence of the people's commune has played the role of the sun. No matter how the right-leaning opportunists nitpick the shortcomings of the commune and exaggerate their slander, the over 500 million farmers have absorbed light and heat under the shining sun, strengthening their boundless vitality towards a new life.

As soon as it appeared, it truly shone like the sun, illuminating the path forward for over 500 million farmers. The people's commune movement swept across the entire Chinese countryside, forming a surging high tide, and immediately demonstrated its unprecedented power of light and heat in various production tasks.

Is this "rising sun" really related to the "petty-bourgeois fanaticism movement" slandered by the right-leaning opportunists? Of course, the germs hiding in the dark corners will curse the sun, because once the sun rises, the dark corners will disappear, and they will be eliminated by the sun's light and heat, while all things will flourish! People sing:

	“We fetch water from great rivers and lakes,
	What worry even if there's no rain for a hundred days!
	The people's commune is really good,
	Great disasters can also yield great harvests.”
	“The people's commune has great strength,
	Good crops grow even in drought years.”
	“Mutual assistance in times of trouble,
	The commune's strength can turn the tide.”
	“Relying neither on the Dragon King nor on Heaven,
	We dig water sources with one heart and mind.
	The people's commune has great power,
	No matter how great the drought, we are not afraid;
	We control the rain ledger and the wind and clouds are favorable,
	Droughts and floods are eradicated at their roots!”

This is an enthusiastic song of praise for the power of the commune by commune members who have withstood the severe drought and flood disasters this year!

What kind of flourishing vitality has the commune's sun, with its light and heat, brought to the farmers? The "Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement" puts it well: "The superiority of the people's commune includes its large organizational scale, wide range of activities, ability to plan the production and distribution of the entire commune in a unified manner, more effective and full mobilization and rational arrangement of rural labor compared to agricultural production cooperatives, ability to undertake constructions that agricultural production cooperatives could hardly undertake, facilitating the accelerated comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, facilitating the realization of agricultural mechanization, facilitating the stable growth of farmers' income and accelerating the progress of the entire rural life, facilitating the development of collective undertakings such as public canteens and nurseries, and a certain amount of the supply system can be included in the distribution, etc. All these superiorities will be demonstrated more and more significantly."

This is the power of the commune's sun, with its light and heat. This is the result of what the right-leaning opportunists slandered as the "petty-bourgeois fanaticism movement." Of course, this is only the material result. If we add the spiritual results, it becomes even more immeasurable.

In Shishou County, Hubei Province, there was such a glorious event: In the People's Da Yuan Commune of Shishou County, on the banks of the Yangtze River, the whole commune used its collective strength this spring to build a water diversion gate in Jiaoziyuan. The Yangtze River water introduced every day can supply 70% of the commune's fields with self-flowing irrigation, ensuring harvests for 110,000 mu of land. However, due to the drought, they saw that the neighboring Puji People's Commune in Jiangling County, the Wangqiao People's Commune in Jianli County, and the Da Yuan Farm were short of water sources and faced greater difficulties in fighting the drought. The People's Da Yuan Commune made a glorious decision: to conserve water and give the water source to them, so that 144,000 mu of "crops dying of thirst got life-saving water." When the reporter reported the news, he asked the question: "When the life-saving water flows from the canals of the People's Da Yuan Commune to the drought-stricken fields of Jiangling and Jianli, is it just 'H2O' that is flowing there? There is something more gratifying and more precious inside, that is, the communist spirit of cooperation pouring out from the hearts of the commune members of the People's Da Yuan Commune."

Under drought conditions, could such a noble style of actively sending water to others have been imagined in the old society? No! If it had been that time, not only would they not have sent water, but they would have fought to the point of bloodshed for water. However, today, with the sun of the commune, it not only brings the material power to overcome all difficulties, but also brings spiritual power, which makes people stand higher. Commune members are no longer petty private owners but collective owners who are moving towards communism. They are changing the face of nature and also changing their own spiritual outlook.

I ask, under the illumination of such a bright and splendid sun, why would people not be filled with and increasing in "heat"? Why would they not be enthusiastic about establishing people's communes? What does this have in common with petty-bourgeois fanaticism? No matter how the enemies at home and abroad and the right-leaning opportunists tremble at this "heat," the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will surely be even more enthusiastic about developing people's communes, and become more and more enthusiastic, because the sun is always radiating light and heat, which no curse from any germs can stop!

    太阳的光和热	谢帆
    党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”里，曾用“初升的太阳”，来形容人民公社，这真是再没有更好、更恰如其分的比喻！太阳是普照万物的。没有太阳的光和热的威力，万物就不能生长。对于五亿多中国农民来说，人民公社的出现，正是起了太阳的作用。不管右倾机会主义分子怎样挑剔公社的缺点，进行夸大的诽谤，五亿多农民却在这轮光芒四射的太阳的普照下，吸取了光和热，增强了走向新生活的无限生命力。
    它一出现，就真是像太阳一样放射出耀眼的光芒，照亮了五亿多农民的前进道路，人民公社运动席卷了整个中国的农村，形成了热浪澎湃的高潮，而且立刻在各种生产任务里显示了它的空前未有的光和热的威力。
    这“初升的太阳”，难道真和右倾机会主义分子所诬蔑的“小资产阶级狂热性运动”有什么相干吗？躲在阴暗角落里的毒菌，当然是要诅咒太阳的，因为太阳一升起，阴暗角落就要消失，它们就要为太阳的光和热所消灭，万物却因此而欣欣向荣！人们歌唱着：
      “大江大湖去取水，百日无雨又何愁！人民公社实在好，大灾也能大丰收。”“人民公社力量大，旱年长出了好庄稼。”“患难相扶大支援，公社力大能回天。”“不靠龙王不靠天，同心协力挖水源。人民公社威力大，干旱再大也不怕；自掌雨簿风云顺，旱涝灾害连根拔！”
    这是经受了今年严重旱涝灾害考验的公社社员对公社威力热情的歌颂！
    公社太阳的光和热，究竟给农民带来了什么样的欣欣向荣的生命力呢？“中国共产党八届八中全会关于增产节约运动的决议”里说得好：“人民公社的优越性，包括组织规模大，活动范围广，可以统一筹划全社的生产和分配，可以比农业生产合作社更有效地充分动员和合理安排农村的劳动力，可以兴办农业生产合作社所难以兴办的建设，便于加快农林牧副渔和工农商学兵的综合发展，便于实现农业机械化，便于实现农民收入的稳定增长和加快农村整个生活的进步，便于发展公共食堂、托儿所等集体事业，在分配中可以有一定的供给制成分，等等，所有这些优越性，将越来越显著地发挥出来。”
    这就是公社太阳的光和热的威力，这就是右倾机会主义分子所诬蔑的什么“小资产阶级狂热性运动”的成果。当然，这还只是物质方面的成果，如果再加上精神方面的成果，就更加无可计量了。
    在湖北石首县就出现了这样一件光彩夺目的事情：在长江边上石首县人民大垸公社，今年春天用全社集体力量，在蛟子渊建成了一座引水大闸。每天引进的江水，可以供应全社70％的田自流灌溉，可以使十一万亩田保收。但是，由于天气干旱，他们眼看着邻近的江陵县普济人民公社、监利县汪桥人民公社和大垸农场，水源缺乏，同干旱作斗争有更大的困难。人民大垸公社就作出了一个光荣的决定：节约用水，把水源让给他们，使得十四万四千亩“渴得要死的庄稼得到了救命水。”记者在报道这个消息的时候，提出了这样的问题：“当活命的水从人民大垸公社的渠道向江陵、监利的久旱的田地流去的时候，那里奔流着的难道只是‘氢二氧一’的水吗？里面有更令人欣喜、更值得珍贵的东西，那就是从人民大垸公社社员们心里倾泻而出的共产主义协作精神。”
    在干旱的情况下，这种主动给别人送水的高尚风格，难道是在旧社会能够想像出来的事吗？不！如果是那个时候，岂只不会送水，还要为争水而打得头破血流。可是，今天有了公社的太阳，就不只带来了克服一切困难的物质的威力，而且带来了精神的威力，它使人们站得更高了。公社社员不再是小私有者而是正在向共产主义前进的集体所有者，他们在改变大自然的面貌，也改变着自己的精神面貌。
    试问在这样一轮光辉灿烂的太阳照耀下，人们为什么不充满着增长着“热”力呢？为什么不热衷于建立人民公社呢？这和小资产阶级的狂热性有哪点相同呢？不管国内外敌人和右倾机会主义分子怎样震悸于这“热”，中国人民在共产党的领导下一定会更加热衷于发展人民公社，而且愈来愈热，因为太阳总是无时无刻不在散发着光和热，这是任何毒菌的诅咒都阻挡不住的！
