Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: According to TASS, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, visited the home of the famous Soviet writer Mikhail Sholokhov in the town of Veshenskaya, Rostov Oblast, on August 30th. On the same day, he spoke at a mass meeting held in the town, discussing the domestic situation in the Soviet Union and some major issues in the current international situation.

    The Soviet State is Successfully Completing the Seven-Year Plan

    Khrushchev said that the internal situation in the Soviet Union is good, and the people are constantly achieving new successes and moving forward with confidence. A widespread campaign to strive for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan is being launched throughout the country, in both urban and rural areas. The tasks of the Seven-Year Plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPSU are being successfully completed and overfulfilled.

    He said that the industrial production plan for the first seven months of 1959 had been fulfilled by 105%. The total output value of industrial products increased by 12% compared with the same period last year. The measures to innovate technology, formulated in the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the June Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, are being consistently implemented and are producing good results. Agricultural workers, like all Soviet people, have also made a good start in implementing the Seven-Year Plan. Public animal husbandry is developing smoothly. As of August 1, the total number of cattle on collective farms and state farms had increased by 16% compared with last year, including a 10% increase in dairy cows. As of August 20, the state had purchased 61% more meat, 16% more milk, 29% more eggs, and 16% more wool than in the same period last year.

    He said that recently, agricultural cultivation techniques have improved throughout the country, including in your Rostov Oblast. However, you still need to greatly improve the level of farming. This is especially necessary because drought is not a rare visitor in your region. To overcome the impact of drought, we can only rely on a high level of farming. To this end, it is necessary to improve breeding work, sow in a timely manner, strengthen field management, widely plant maize on spring-sown land, harvest in a timely manner, and cultivate the soil well to retain moisture. According to your conditions, the most important task is to strive to retain moisture and remove weeds.

    He said that the situation in our country is now very good. This situation has been formed because our people are united firmly and are united around their beloved Communist Party.

    The Mission of Art is to Profoundly Express the Emerging Great Achievements and Analyze the Spiritual World of Our Contemporaries

    When talking about Sholokhov's creative achievements, Khrushchev talked about literary and artistic creation. He said that the Soviet people's intellectuals and their writers play a huge and important role in the nationwide struggle to build communism. Our writers use their excellent works to promote the unity of the people and help educate the Soviet people in the spirit of communism. The creation of the great Soviet writer Sholokhov is a brilliant example.

    Khrushchev said that our Party has always attached great importance to the development of literature and art, and regards writers as active and faithful assistants in our communist education of the working people. Now that we have entered the period of comprehensively expanding communist construction, the role of art has increased especially. We are building communism for the sake of people and their happiness. When people enter communism, they should get rid of the habits of private owners, get rid of egoism, selfishness—get rid of everything that prevents people from living in a communist way. For Soviet literature, it is important not only to portray people's undertakings and achievements, but also to show the source of the heroic spirit generated in the struggle for the victory of communism. The mission of our art is to profoundly and truthfully express the emerging great achievements and analyze the spiritual world of our contemporaries, their thoughts, feelings and aspirations.

    The Current International Situation is Good, but We Should be Vigilant Against the Danger of a New War

    Khrushchev said, you know that I will be visiting the United States soon at the invitation of President Eisenhower. I am very happy to invite Sholokhov to visit the United States with me. Then he talked about the current international situation.

    He said that safeguarding peace in the world is now a matter of concern and concern for everyone. People correctly believe that this issue is the main international issue. What is the current international situation like? How do we estimate the current situation? We believe that if we estimate it according to the main characteristics of the international situation—safeguarding world peace—the situation is not so bad, or more correctly, it is even good.

    Of course, we must not forget that military blocs still exist; people who try to strengthen and expand such military blocs have not disappeared. This actually means the increase in military spending and the continuous accumulation and improvement of armaments by countries participating in military blocs. In the case of an unprecedented arms race continuing, the danger is very serious, and even a slight miscalculation by the leaders of a certain country could lead to the outbreak of a new war. Therefore, we cannot be negligent, we should be vigilant, and we should take certain measures to ensure the security of our motherland.

    Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has made great efforts to ease international tensions. In recent years, we have reduced our armed forces by 2.14 million people and abolished our military bases in other countries. At that time, we hoped that other countries would follow our example. Unfortunately, however, our hopes have been dashed. On the contrary, some Western governments have stated that they will continue to pursue a policy of expanding armaments, expanding military bases, and strengthening their military blocs in the future. In other words, they are standing on the position of the "Cold War" and using their military bases to surround the Soviet Union.

    He said that despite these negative factors, we believe that the international situation is not very bad. Why? Is there a contradiction here? No. Although stubborn militarists obviously have not finally given up the attempt to take a "chance"—to carry out military adventures against socialist countries—the number of supporters of this adventure is decreasing year by year, which is a fact. Even many stubborn imperialists have begun to believe that it is very risky and dangerous to use war to oppose the Soviet Union and other socialist countries now. Why did they come to this conclusion? This is due to the increase in the power of the socialist camp. Socialist countries are developing their economies and cultures at a high speed and improving the living standards of the people.

    Khrushchev said that the idea of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is gaining more and more support in various countries around the world. Now, the issue of easing international tensions and eliminating the "Cold War" has become the focus of attention of the world's public. It is precisely because of this that the news of the mutual visits between the heads of the Soviet and American governments has received such warm and widespread support.

    Khrushchev said that now, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States and other capitalist countries is somewhat better than before. After British Prime Minister Macmillan visited the Soviet Union in February of this year, Soviet-British relations have improved significantly. A trade treaty was concluded with the United Kingdom on mutually beneficial terms. In culture, science and art, our country's contacts and connections with foreign countries are also expanding rapidly. Soviet government personnel visited the United States. The national leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States held very frank and beneficial talks. From all aspects, these talks produced good results.

    There Can Be No Differences Between Our People and the Government, Nixon's Argument is Extremely Wrong

    Khrushchev said that U.S. Vice President Nixon recently came to the Soviet Union to preside over the opening of the American Exhibition held in Moscow. We had very full talks with Mr. Nixon. He met with many Soviet people. This gives hope that he now has a better understanding of us and our people. Unfortunately, Mr. Nixon still stands on the wrong position in his speeches about the Soviet Union. For example, after he returned to the United States, he said that although anti-American propaganda was carried out in the Soviet Union, the Soviet people treated the United States in a friendly manner. It seems that Nixon only came to this conclusion after his visit to the Soviet Union. Presumably, someone wanted to use this argument to convince Americans that the Soviet government treats the United States with one policy, while the Soviet people seem to hold another view.

    Khrushchev said that it is completely wrong to say that anti-American propaganda was carried out in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has never carried out anti-American propaganda. The propaganda we have carried out in the past and will carry out in the future is only against militarists, against generals who carry out threats of force, and against monopoly capitalists who advocate continuing the "Cold War." Soviet newspapers, national leaders, and all Soviet people oppose these people. However, in the Soviet Union, no one has ever opposed the United States and the American people at any time. We have not, do not, and will not carry out such propaganda.

    On the contrary, we have always said that the American people, like our Soviet people and the people of all countries, hope for peace. In the United States, not only the working class and peasants, but also the broad strata of industry and intellectuals do not approve of the views of militarists, "Cold War" advocates, and the "position of strength" policy. Only militarists and "Cold War" advocates are afraid of the fresh air that can dispel the atmosphere of international tension, and are afraid of disarmament, that is, afraid of reducing profitable orders for the production of weapons. When the news of mutual visits between the head of the Soviet government and U.S. President Eisenhower came out, didn't this fear affect stock prices on the exchange?

    Mr. Nixon's argument about the Soviet government and the Soviet people is extremely wrong. He does not understand our people. During Mr. Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union, we treated him in a friendly and respectful manner, regarding him as a representative of a country that the Soviet Union wants to be friendly with. This does not mean that anyone in our country agrees with Mr. Nixon's political views.

    Khrushchev said that our people are accustomed to respectfully receiving guests of their government. There are no differences between our people and the government, nor can there be any. I can say without exaggeration that any country would envy the close unity of our people, government, and Communist Party. No one should try to find cracks between the people and the Soviet government, it is a waste of effort!

    Khrushchev talked about Nixon's speech at the "American Legion" convention and refuted some of the claims about the Soviet Union in this speech. Khrushchev said that when Nixon was in the Soviet Union, I openly told him that the Soviet people did not inquire about Nixon's past. We knew at the time that he was a supporter of McCarthyism. After returning to his country, Nixon used the typical language of reactionaries like McCarthy and repeated the slander of the threat of "Communist rule over the people of all countries."

    We Adhere to the Principle of Peaceful Coexistence, and All People, Especially the Leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, Should End the Cold War

    Khrushchev said, I cannot but talk about a saying that many Western politicians constantly repeat. When talking about capitalist countries, these politicians call them "free societies" and "free worlds," and all other countries that live in other ways are regarded as "unfree worlds." This statement is to deceive the masses. However, life exposes their unfounded lies. Hundreds of millions of people believe that the socialist way of life is the most in line with the fundamental interests of the people, and therefore the most free way of life. In socialist countries, everything policy starts from the vital interests of the people. Socialist countries guarantee true freedom, guarantee true equality for all citizens before the law, and guarantee the continuous improvement of the material well-being of all working people. In these countries, there are no exploiters and the exploited, because all means of production belong to the people. In this way, what can be more noble, more humane, and more free than the socialist system?

    He continued, we adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence. We say: we should not interfere in each other's internal affairs, and we should not use force to resolve ideological differences and other disputes. If we can reach an agreement on this basis, then it will be easy to find a way to ensure peaceful coexistence. At that time, we will also be able to find a common language on disputes that currently tense the entire situation and create the danger of a new war. At that time, we will be able to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, the issue of banning nuclear weapons, and other issues that make the world uneasy. In this case, the conditions for eliminating war from social life can be guaranteed.

    Our Party, the Central Committee, and the Soviet government firmly believe that we are close to the moment when all of the above will become a reality. Every new achievement of the Soviet Union and the achievements of all socialist countries bring this moment closer. The idea of peaceful coexistence will surely triumph. All of us, especially the leaders of the two strongest countries, the Soviet Union and the United States, should strive to end the "Cold War," the arms race, and the "position of strength" policy that the majority of residents in the United States and the world have become tired of.

    Khrushchev said that communism has defended its right to exist. Using cannons and atomic bombs to oppose communism, as the history of the past century has proven, is completely hopeless. If Westerners believe that their set of philosophy is viable, then let them prove it with facts. We do not want to use force to impose our philosophy and our way of life on anyone. We advocate peaceful coexistence: let us compete on the stage of improving the welfare of the people. If people in capitalist countries are so convinced of the superiority of their philosophy and their way of life, then let them accept the challenge of peaceful competition. Let time and history prove what is better. Only those who are not sure of the correctness of their views and who are not confident in their system do not accept our challenge of peaceful competition.

    We Visit the United States with the Best Wishes

    Khrushchev also talked about the statement made by U.S. President Eisenhower at a press conference on August 25. Khrushchev said that this conversation by the U.S. President showed that he was prepared to promote the elimination of tension in relations between countries. We see here a good basis for a productive exchange of views with the President. We believe that the following conversation by Mr. Eisenhower is of great significance: he expressed his willingness to "conduct realistic negotiations with the Soviet Union on sensible and mutually secure plans for comprehensive disarmament or disarmament in specific types of weapons; lay a real foundation for resolving the various issues of a divided Germany, and through other means promote the easing of world tensions." Unfortunately, it should be pointed out that in answering reporters' questions, the President, to some extent, repeated certain arguments with a "Cold War" spirit. Let us hope that the President talks about these things only out of past prejudice.

    Khrushchev said, we are visiting the United States with the best wishes. We hope to do everything possible to eliminate the "Cold War" state, thereby easing international tensions and creating conditions for people to live and work in peace.

    Khrushchev said that we are willing to reduce armaments, and are willing to withdraw our troops from the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Hungary back to our country, if Western countries are also prepared to withdraw their troops from the territories of other countries.

    If our Western partners are not prepared to withdraw their troops all at once, then let us reach an agreement on gradually withdrawing troops. We are prepared to agree to any effective supervision of disarmament and troop withdrawal, if Western countries also do so and agree to abolish military bases. When someone wants to force us to accept supervision and wants to deploy their supervisors everywhere in our country, while at the same time maintaining military bases around our country, then this is not disarmament, but an ultimatum. This is nothing more than an attempt to impose unilateral conditions on others, (these conditions are only beneficial to those who try to impose them) that is, to set up supervisors in our factories and enterprises, while they surround our country with bases in order to wait for an opportunity to attack.

    The Soviet Union is Willing to Seek Mutually Acceptable Agreements, but Will Never Give Up its Position and Principles

    Khrushchev said that, of course, we know that there are many differences between the Soviet Union and the United States. The question now is: should we continue to maintain these differences and not oppose the possibility of these differences deepening? Or should we seek ways to eliminate these differences? The Soviet Union expresses its determination to seek mutually acceptable agreements on the most acute international issues. However, if someone fantasizes that we will give up our national position and our principles as the price for signing such an agreement, then he is greatly mistaken. Disputes can and must be resolved by considering the interests of all relevant countries, and first of all, it is necessary to solve the most urgent issues, because the failure to solve these issues affects the healthy development of the international situation. We believe that these issues include first of all the conclusion of a German peace treaty that can normalize the situation in Europe, eliminate the obstacles between the two Germanies, and eliminate the remnants of the occupation system in West Berlin.

    Khrushchev then talked about the reply from the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adenauer, to his letter of August 18 this year. He said that at first glance, this reply gives a good impression. If we talk about the substance of Mr. Adenauer's reply, then first of all, it should be pointed out that the tone of this letter is more measured, and in this regard, it is very different from some past documents of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

    Khrushchev said that Adenauer's letter touches on some very important issues and expresses a willingness to better understand these acute issues in favor of the development of cooperation between our two countries. If action is taken after these words are spoken, then it can be assumed that we can eliminate our differences in discussing urgent international issues and take a step in easing international tensions and improving relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    It should be pointed out that these issues are talked about very simply and generally in the letter. We hope that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany can propose its own solutions to such important issues as disarmament, eliminating the "remnants of war," and developing cooperation between our two countries in a more comprehensive manner. We believe that these issues are not impossible to resolve as long as the other party is willing. As long as Western countries are truly willing to peacefully resolve urgent international issues, these issues can be resolved.

    Khrushchev said that our enemies often accuse us of saying that the Soviet Union does not abide by international treaties. This is not right. Only those who deliberately distort the facts will say such things. The Soviet Union has always fulfilled and will solemnly fulfill its international obligations in the future. We, who have always adhered to the principle of peaceful coexistence, will continue to be committed to defending the norms of international law in relations between countries.

    Khrushchev once again emphasized that he is going to the United States this time with good intentions, and he eagerly hopes to do his due diligence in easing international tensions and strengthening the cause of peace. He said that we are determined to take measures to promote the melting of the ice of the "Cold War" so that the people of all countries can breathe completely freely. It is hoped that the U.S. government will also act based on such considerations. (The subheadings in the text are added by the editor of this newspaper)

    赫鲁晓夫在维申斯卡亚镇群众大会上讲话
    苏联决心采取措施消除冷战  希望美国政府也能够这样做
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫于8月30日到罗斯托夫州维申斯卡亚镇苏联著名作家萧洛霍夫的家里作客，当天他在这个镇上举行的群众大会上讲了话，谈到了苏联国内形势和当前国际局势中的一些重大问题。
    苏维埃国家正在顺利地完成七年计划
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的内部情况是好的，人民每天不断取得新的成就，满怀信心地向前迈进。全国城乡各地广泛展开了争取提前完成七年计划的运动。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的七年计划的任务正在顺利地完成和超额完成。
    他说，1959年头七个月的工业生产计划已经完成了105％。工业产品的总产值比去年同期增加了12％。苏共第二十一次代表大会和党中央委员会六月全会的决议中所拟定的革新技术的措施正在坚持贯彻，并且产生了良好的结果。农业劳动者和全体苏联人民一样，在执行七年计划方面也做出了良好的开端。公共畜牧业在顺利地发展着。到8月1日为止，集体农庄和国营农场牛的总头数比去年增加了16％，其中奶牛增加了10％。截至8月20日为止，国家所采购的肉类比去年同期增加了61％，奶类增加了16％，蛋类增加了29％，羊毛增加了16％。
    他说，近来，全国各地，其中也包括你们罗斯托夫州，农业耕作技术提高了。但是，你们还需要大大提高农作水平。这一点所以特别需要，还因为在你们这个地区，干旱已经不是什么稀客了。要克服干旱影响，只有靠高度的农作水平。为此，就需要改进育种工作，要播种及时，加强田间管理，在春播地上广泛种植玉蜀黍，及时收割和好好地翻耕土壤，以便保持水分。根据你们的条件，最首要的任务是务求保持水分，清除杂草。
    他说，我们国家的情况现在非常良好。这种情况之所以形成是由于我们的人民牢不可破地团结一致，由于他们团结在自己亲爱的共产党的周围。
    艺术的使命是深刻地表达涌现的伟绩，剖析我们当代人的精神世界
    在谈到萧洛霍夫的创作成就时，赫鲁晓夫谈到了文学艺术创作问题。他说，苏联人民的知识分子及其作家队伍，在建设共产主义的全民斗争中起着巨大而重要的作用。我们作家用自己的优秀作品促使人民加强团结，帮助以共产主义精神教育苏联人。伟大的苏联作家萧洛霍夫的创作就是一个光辉的榜样。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们党过去和现在一直都极其重视文学和艺术的发展，把作家看作是自己对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的积极的、忠实的助手。现在，我们进入了全面展开共产主义建设时期，艺术的这个作用就特别增加了。我们建设共产主义，是为了人，为了他们的幸福。人们进入共产主义的时候，应当摆脱私有者的习惯，摆脱利己主义、自私观念——摆脱一切妨碍人们按照共产主义方式生活的东西。对于苏联文学来说，重要的不仅是刻划人们的事业和功勋，而且要表明在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中所产生的英雄气概的思想泉源。我们的艺术的使命是：深刻地、真实地表达涌现的伟绩，剖析我们当代人的精神世界、他们的思想感情和憧憬。
    目前国际形势是好的，但是我们对新战争的危险应当有所警惕
    赫鲁晓夫说，你们知道，最近我将要应艾森豪威尔总统的邀请去访问美国。我很高兴邀请萧洛霍夫跟我一道去美国访问。接着他谈到当前的国际形势问题。
    他说，保障全世界和平现在是人人关心、人人牵挂的问题。人们正确地认为，这个问题是主要的国际问题。目前的国际形势怎么样呢？我们怎样估计目前的形势呢？我们认为，如果根据国际形势的主要特征——保障全世界和平——来估计它，形势不那么坏，更正确点说，甚至是好的。
    当然，决不能忘记，军事集团仍然存在；企图加强和扩大这种军事集团的人还没有绝迹。这实际上意味着参加军事集团的国家的军事费用的增加、军备的不断积累和改良。在空前规模的军备竞赛继续进行的情况下，危险性很严重，甚至只要某个国家的领导人稍一失算，就会导致新战争的爆发。因此，我们不能疏忽大意，应当有所警惕，采取一定的措施来保证我们祖国的安全。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府为了缓和国际紧张局势作出了很大的努力。最近几年中，我们将自己的武装部队缩减了二百一十四万人，取消了我国在其他国家境内的军事基地。当时我们希望，其他国家也会效法我们的榜样。然而遗憾的是，我们的希望落空了。与此相反，一些西方国家的政府表示，它们在今后仍将继续奉行扩张军备政策、扩大军事基地和加强自己的军事集团。换句话说，他们站在“冷战”的立场上，用自己的军事基地来包围苏联。
    他说，尽管有这些消极的因素，然而我们认为国际局势十分不坏。为什么呢？这里是否有矛盾呢？没有。虽然顽固的军国主义者，显然没有最后放弃碰碰“运气”的企图——对社会主义国家进行军事冒险，但是，这种冒险的支持者在一年年地减少，这却是事实。甚至许多顽固不化的帝国主义者也开始相信，现在要用战争手段去反对苏联和其他社会主义国家是非常冒险的和危险的。某些老牌的军国主义者承认，如果发动战争，自己可能在这场战争中毁灭。由于什么缘故他们得出了这样的结论呢？这是由于社会主义阵营的威力的增长。社会主义国家正以高速度发展自己的经济、文化，提高人民的生活水平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，社会制度不同的国家和平共处的思想在世界各国获得越来越多的支持者。现在，缓和国际紧张局势和消除“冷战”的问题成了全世界公众注意的中心。正是因为如此，苏联和美国两国政府首脑相互访问的消息得到如此热烈和广泛的支持。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在，苏联同美国和其他资本主义国家的相互关系比以前有些好转。英国首相麦克米伦在今年2月访问了苏联以后，苏英关系有了显著的好转。根据互利的条件同英国缔结了贸易条约。在文化、科学和艺术方面，我国同外国的接触和联系也在迅速扩大。苏联政府人员访问了美国。苏联和美国的国家领导人之间举行了十分坦率和有益的交谈。从各方面看来，这些交谈产生了良好的结果。
      在我们人民和政府之间不可能有任何分歧，尼克松的论断是极其错误的
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国副总统尼克松不久前到苏联主持了在莫斯科举办的美国展览会的开幕。我们同尼克松先生举行了十分充分的交谈。他会见了许多苏联人。这使人希望，他现在该比较好地了解我们、了解我们的人民。遗憾的是，尼克松先生在他的谈论苏联的演说中仍然站在错误的立场上。例如，在他回到美国以后，他曾说，虽然在苏联进行过反对美国的宣传，但苏联人民对待美国是友好的。好像尼克松在他访问苏联后才得出这个结论。想必是有人想利用这种论调来使美国人相信，苏联政府对待美国是一种方针，而苏联人民似乎却抱有另一种看法。
    赫鲁晓夫说，说在苏联进行过反对美国的宣传，这是完全错误的。苏联从来没有进行过反对美国的宣传。我们过去和将来进行的宣传只是反对军国主义者、反对进行武力威胁的将军们、反对鼓吹继续进行“冷战”的垄断资本家。苏联的报纸、国家领导人以及全体苏联人民都反对这些人。但是，在苏联，任何人和任何时候都从来没有反对美国这个国家和美国人民。我们过去、现在和将来都不会进行这种宣传。
    相反地，我们过去和现在一直都说，美国人民，像我们苏联人民和各国人民一样，希望和平。在美国，不仅工人阶级和农民，而且实业界的广大阶层和知识分子都不赞成军国主义分子、“冷战”鼓吹者的观点和“实力地位”政策。只有军国主义分子和“冷战”的鼓吹者才害怕吹来可以驱散国际紧张气氛的新鲜空气，才害怕裁减军备，也就是说害怕减少有利可图的生产武器的订货。当苏联政府首脑和美国总统艾森豪威尔之间相互访问的消息传出后，难道这种害怕心理对交易所的股票牌价没有产生影响吗？
    尼克松先生对于苏联政府和苏联人民的论断是极其错误的。他不了解我们的人民。在尼克松先生访问苏联期间，我们对待他是友好的、尊重的，把他看成是一个苏联想与之友好的国家的代表。这决不表明，在我们国家里有谁同意尼克松先生的政治观点。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的人民习惯于尊敬地接待自己政府的客人。在我们人民和政府之间没有、也不可能有任何分歧。我可以毫不夸张地说，任何国家都会羡慕我国的人民、政府和共产党的这种紧密团结。谁也休想在人民和苏联政府之间寻找裂缝，这是白费气力！
    赫鲁晓夫谈到了尼克松在“美国退伍军人团”代表大会上的演说，并且反驳了这篇演说中一些关于苏联的说法。赫鲁晓夫说，当尼克松在苏联的时候，我曾公开地对他说，苏联人不去打听尼克松的往事。我们当时知道他是麦卡锡主义的支持者。在他回国之后，尼克松竟使用了反动分子麦卡锡之流的典型语言，重弹“共产主义对世界各国人民统治”的威胁的谰调。
    我们坚持和平共处原则，所有的人，首先是苏美两国领导人，应当结束冷战
    赫鲁晓夫说，我不能不谈一谈很多西方政治家们不断重复的一种说法。在谈到资本主义国家的时候，这些政治家把它们叫作“自由社会”、“自由世界”，而所有按照另外的方式生活的其余国家他们都看作是“不自由世界”。这种说法是为了欺骗群众。但是，生活揭露了他们的毫无根据的谎言。亿万人民认为，社会主义生活方式是最符合人民根本利益的，因而也是最自由的生活方式。在社会主义国家一切政策的出发点是人民的切身利益。社会主义国家保证真正的自由，保证全体公民在法律面前真正平等，保证全体劳动人民的物质福利不断提高。在这些国家里没有剥削者和被剥削者，因为一切生产资料都属于人民。这样，有什么东西能比社会主义制度更崇高、更人道、更自由呢？
    他接着说，我们坚持和平共处的原则。我们说：我们不要互相干涉内政，不要用武力来解决思想分歧和其他争端。如果我们能在这个基础上取得一致，那么，就很容易找到保证和平共处的方法。那时，我们也就能在目前使整个局势紧张化并造成新战争危险的争端上找到共同的语言。那时，我们就能就裁军问题、禁止核武器问题以及其他使全世界不安的问题达成协议。在这种情况下，使战争从社会生活中消除掉的那些条件就能有所保证。
    我们的党、中央委员会和苏维埃政府坚信，我们已经接近上述一切将成为事实的时刻。苏联的每一个新成就、所有社会主义国家的成就使这个时刻日益接近。和平共处的思想必定胜利。我们所有的人，首先是最强的苏美两国的领导人，应该努力结束“冷战”、军备竞赛和美国及全世界多数居民已感到厌烦了的“实力地位”政策。
    赫鲁晓夫说，共产主义捍卫住了自己生存的权利。用大炮和原子弹来反对共产主义，像近百年史所证明的，这是完全没有希望的事情。如果西方人士认为，他们的一套哲学是有生命力的话，那末就让他们用事实证明这一点吧。我们不想用武力把自己的哲学、自己的生活方式强加于任何人。我们主张和平共处：让我们在提高人民福利的舞台上竞赛吧。如果资本主义国家的人士那样坚信自己的哲学、自己的生活方式的优越性，那末就让他们接受和平竞赛的挑战吧。让时间和历史来证明，什么更好些。只有那些对自己观点的正确性没有把握、对自己的制度没有信心的人，才不接受我们的和平竞赛的挑战。
  我们怀着最好的愿望去美国访问
    赫鲁晓夫还谈到了美国总统艾森豪威尔于8月25日在记者招待会上发表的声明。赫鲁晓夫说，美国总统这次谈话表明，他准备促使消除国与国关系中的紧张局势。我们从这里看到了将同总统有成果地交换意见的良好基础。我们认为，艾森豪威尔先生的下列谈话有很大意义：他表示愿意“就全面裁军或者特种类型武器方面的裁军的明智的和相互保障的计划同苏联进行现实的谈判；为解决分裂的德国的各项问题奠定真正的基础，并通过其他途径促使世界紧张局势的缓和。”遗憾的是，应该指出，总统在回答记者的问题时，在某种程度上重复了某些带着“冷战”精神的论调。但愿总统谈到这些只不过是出于过去的偏见。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们是怀着最好的愿望去美国访问的。我们希望尽一切努力来消除“冷战”状态，从而缓和国际紧张局势，为人们的安居乐业创造条件。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们愿意裁减军备，愿意把我们的军队从德意志民主共和国、波兰、匈牙利撤回本国，如果西方国家也准备把自己的军队从别国的领土上撤走的话。
    如果我们西方伙伴还不准备一下子撤军，那末，让我们达成逐步撤军的协议。我们准备同意对裁减军备和撤军建立任何有效监督，如果西方国家也这样做，并同意取消军事基地的话。当有人想强迫我们接受监督，并要在我们这里到处配置自己的监督员，同时又要保持设在我国周围的军事基地，那末这就不是什么裁军，而是最后通牒。这不外是企图把单方面的条件强加于人，（这些条件只对那些企图将其强加于人的人有利）即在我们的工厂和企业中设置监督员，而自己却用基地包围我国，以便待机进攻。
    苏联愿意寻求相互可以接受的协议，但决不会放弃立场和原则
    赫鲁晓夫说，当然，我们知道苏美之间是有不少分歧的。现在的问题是：是继续保持这种分歧、不去反对这种分歧的可能加深呢？还是去寻求消除这种分歧的途径呢？苏联表示决心就最尖锐的国际问题寻求互相可以接受的协议。但是，如果有人幻想我们会放弃国家的立场和放弃我们的原则作为代价来签订这种协议，那末他就大错而特错了。可以而且必须考虑一切有关国家的利益才能解决争端，而首先是需要解决最迫切的问题，因为这些问题得不到解决就影响国际局势的健康发展，我们认为，这些问题中首先是缔结能使欧洲局势正常化的对德和约，消除两个德国之间的障碍和消除西柏林占领制度的残余。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳对他今年8月18日的信件的复信。他说，初读起来，这封复信使人产生一种良好的印象。如果就阿登纳先生复信的实质来说，那末，首先应当指出，这封信的语调是比较有分寸的，在这方面，它跟德意志联邦共和国政府过去的一些文件大不相同。
    赫鲁晓夫说，阿登纳的信中涉及了一些非常重要的问题，并且表示愿意更好地理解这些尖锐问题以有利于我们两国合作的发展。如果讲过这些话后采取行动，那末可以设想，我们就能够消除我们在讨论迫切的国际问题时的分歧，能够在缓和国际紧张局势和改善苏联同德意志联邦共和国的关系方面迈出一步。
    应当指出，信里对这些问题谈得很简单，很一般。我们希望德意志联邦共和国政府能更全面地对裁军、消除“战争残余”、发展我们两国的合作这样一些重要问题提出自己的解决办法。我们认为，只要对方愿意，这些问题不是不能解决的。只要西方国家真正愿意和平解决迫切的国际问题，这些问题就可以解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的敌人经常指责我们，说什么苏联不遵守国际条约。这是不对的。只有故意歪曲事实的人才会讲出这种话来。苏联一贯履行、今后也要庄严履行自己的国际义务。一贯坚持和平共处原则的我们，今后要致力于保卫各国关系中的国际法准则。
    赫鲁晓夫再一次着重表示，他这次到美国去，怀着良好的意愿，他热切希望对缓和国际紧张局势的事业和加强和平的事业尽一份应尽的力量。他说，我们决心采取措施来促使“冷战”的冰块融化，使各国人民有可能完全自由地呼吸。希望美国政府也根据这样的考虑行事。（文内小标题是本报编者所加）（附图片）
