The 15th anniversary of the Bulgarian people's liberation from fascist tyranny falls on September 9, 1959. Fifteen years ago, on this day, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the decisive assistance of the Soviet army, the Bulgarian people staged a national armed uprising, overthrew the royal fascist rule, and established a people's democratic government. The victory of the people's armed uprising on September 9, 1944, is the most glorious page in Bulgarian history. It forever ended the past of enslavement and oppression for the Bulgarian people, and opened a new era for Bulgaria, an era of the people and socialism.

Over the past fifteen years, the labor-loving Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party and with the selfless assistance from the great Soviet Union, and through mutual assistance and cooperation with other socialist countries, have successfully completed two five-year economic construction plans from 1949 to 1957 after two years of national economic recovery. They have achieved significant successes, fundamentally changed the backward state of the national economy, and established a solid foundation for socialist society. Today, Bulgaria has a developed industry, including a technologically new heavy industry. Various machines, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, chemical fertilizers, and other chemical products, which used to rely on imports, can now be produced domestically, and some are even exported. In 1958, Bulgaria's total industrial output value increased by 7.86 times compared to 1939, the highest level before liberation. In just over a decade, it has far surpassed some capitalist neighboring countries that were at the same level of industrial development in the past. For example, in 1956, Greece's industrial production increased by only 90% compared to 1939, and Turkey only increased by 1.3 times during the same period, while Bulgaria increased by 5.7 times.

Bulgaria is the second country in Europe, after the Soviet Union, to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. The Bulgarian people have reason to be proud of solving this complex and difficult problem in socialist construction so quickly. At the same time, it once again vividly confirms the great creative power of socialist ideology. With the smooth completion of agricultural collectivization, Bulgaria's agricultural technology and agricultural product output have also significantly improved. Currently, in Bulgaria's rural areas, 95% of plowing, 89% of sowing, 46% of harvesting, and 98% of threshing work have been mechanized. The total value of agricultural products increased by 25% during the second five-year plan period (1953-1957) alone.

As a result of implementing the socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and mechanization policies, the structure of Bulgaria's national economy has undergone essential changes. In the national economy, the ratio of total industrial and agricultural output value, while the total agricultural output value increased, has changed from 24.8 to 75.2 in 1939 to 69.9 to 30.1 in 1958. In industry, the ratio of heavy industry and light industry output value, while light industry has made great progress, has changed from 23 to 77 in 1939 to 45.8 to 54.2 in 1958. Today, Bulgaria stands tall at the eastern end of the Balkan Peninsula as a socialist industrial-agricultural country with a developed industry and large-scale collectivized and mechanized agriculture.

With the rapid development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of the Bulgarian people has also improved significantly. In 1958, Bulgaria's national income increased by one and a half times compared to 1939. After the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in April 1956, the Party and the government adopted a series of measures to further improve the people's lives. Now, the people of Bulgaria enjoy free medical care, employees have paid vacations, and the state also provides pensions for members of agricultural production cooperatives.

While building a socialist economy, Bulgaria has also achieved a socialist cultural revolution. Illiteracy was eliminated in the early years after liberation. Bulgaria's long history of culture has truly become the property of the whole people. Literature and art, like all sectors of the national economy, are in a period of unprecedented upsurge. Currently, the number of students and doctors in Bulgaria per capita is among the highest in the world.

The brilliant achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction have not only greatly accelerated the pace of the Bulgarian people's progress but have also strengthened the strength of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. These achievements are the Bulgarian people's great contribution to the peaceful competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system.

The Bulgarian people look back on the path they have taken with pride, and they look forward to the future with even greater pride. The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held last June, was a major event in the modern life of the Bulgarian people. It marked Bulgaria's entry into a new historical period—a period of building socialism and preparing conditions for a gradual transition to communism. This congress will go down in history as a congress of complete victory for socialism. It summarized the tremendous changes that have taken place in Bulgaria and abroad since the Fifth and Sixth Congresses of the Bulgarian Communist Party and gave theoretical explanations; it also put forward future tasks and adopted instructions on the third five-year plan for further socialist construction.

The resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the instructions on the third five-year plan quickly became a huge source of encouragement for the Bulgarian working people. Victory news of overfulfilling production tasks spread from all corners of the country. Then, the Bulgarian Communist Party timely analyzed the favorable conditions for accelerating socialist construction that emerged after the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party and issued a new call to the people in October of last year—to complete the third five-year plan ahead of schedule! This timely and realistic call immediately became the guide to action for the Bulgarian working people.

In January of this year, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party held a plenary session, at which Comrade Zhivkov made a report outline on "accelerating the development of the national economy, improving the people's material and cultural living standards, and improving national and economic leadership." The plenary session put forward a plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1962 to 1965, and at the same time put forward significant improvement opinions on the work of national and economic leadership. This report outline has been discussed at the third session of the National Assembly held in March this year, and corresponding laws have been passed. The report stipulates that compared with the last year of the second five-year plan, that is, 1957, the total value of industrial production in 1962 will increase by about one time (the original instructions on the third five-year plan passed by the Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party stipulated that it would only increase by 62%), and by 1965 it will increase by two to three times; in agriculture, the total value of agricultural products in 1962 will reach 40 billion to 45 billion levs (about 20 billion levs more than the old target), and in 1965 it will increase to 60 billion levs, that is, three times more than in 1957.

Based on the rapid development of production, the material and cultural living standards of the Bulgarian people will also have significant improvements. The report stipulates that compared with 1957, the national income in 1962 will increase by more than one time (the old target stipulated an increase of 50%), and in 1965 it will increase by nearly two times. The people's consumption in 1962 will increase by about one time compared with 1957 (the old target only stipulated an increase of 40%), and in 1965 it will increase by about one and a half times.

This is a very grand leap forward plan! In order to achieve this great leap forward in the economy, further implement the Leninist principle of democratic centralism in national life, combine central leadership with the initiative of local institutions and the masses, and combine with the active participation of the working people in national management and economic leadership, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government have already taken and are preparing to take a series of major measures. For example, new administrative and economic divisions have been formulated, national institutions have been reorganized, local authority has been expanded, and in addition, specific measures have been formulated in agriculture, liberating women's labor, improving the labor remuneration system, and preparing conditions for overcoming urban-rural differences. The realization of the above plans and measures will mean that the Bulgarian people have taken a big step forward towards the great goal of communism.

It is particularly worth mentioning that a nationwide movement of merging cooperatives was carried out last winter on the basis of realizing agricultural collectivization. This is an event of great significance in the development of socialist agriculture in Bulgaria. This mass movement of merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives was successfully completed in just a few months. By April of this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had been merged from 3,292 to 984 large cooperatives, each large cooperative having more than 1,000 households, and the land area also increased from the previous 5,000 to 10,000 decares to 40,000 to 45,000 decares.

The expanded agricultural production cooperatives have opened up broad possibilities for large-scale water conservancy construction, a more rational arrangement of diversified rural economy, and better utilization of land, labor, and agricultural machinery, thereby playing a positive role in the further growth of agricultural production. For example, from a mass movement of water conservancy construction launched by the Bulgarian people in vast rural areas last November, by July of this year, the water conservancy projects completed by the masses of agricultural cooperatives themselves could irrigate 1.5 million decares of land. Together with the water conservancy projects built by the state, a total of 1.7 million decares of land can be irrigated. This means that the expanded irrigated area in less than eight months is almost four times more than the irrigated area opened up during the 65 years of bourgeois rule. The irrigated area increased by Bulgaria in one day this year is more than the total irrigated area expanded by it in one year and four months before liberation.

All these achievements of the Bulgarian people not only prove once again the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, but also show that once the broad working people truly master their own destiny and become masters of society, they will definitely be able to muster their energy and create historical miracles.

It must be pointed out that the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the Bulgarian people have now been raised to an unprecedented level. When the people of the whole country participated in the discussion of completing the third five-year plan ahead of schedule and the report outline of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, a total of tens of thousands of large and small meetings were held, with nearly half of the country's population participating and putting forward 38,000 suggestions in various ways. Nationwide discussion, such a good method of linking leadership with the masses and giving play to the creativity and initiative of the people, has become a good working tradition of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

Today, labor in Bulgaria, like in other socialist countries, is a glorious and heroic undertaking, and it is loved and respected by the people more than ever before. At the end of last year, the Bulgarian government made a decision that cadres of each state institution and mass organization should participate in material production labor for at least 30 days each year. Rural cadres widely planted experimental fields. Many writers and artists also went to the countryside and factories to live and work with the working people. In addition, it has become even more common for students and citizens to participate in public welfare voluntary labor. In recent months, the Bulgarian people have launched an even greater labor upsurge, greeting the great 15th anniversary of the National Day with outstanding labor achievements, and striving to complete the third five-year plan in three or four years with selfless labor and soaring enthusiasm.

While achieving great achievements in domestic socialist construction, the Bulgarian people have also achieved great achievements in international life. The international status of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has greatly improved. The Bulgarian people are a people with a tradition of rich proletarian internationalism, resolutely opposing imperialism and strongly supporting national independence movements. The Bulgarian Communist Party and the government have made outstanding contributions to strengthening the great unity of the world communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to opposing modern revisionism represented by the leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism. They have also made unremitting efforts in supporting national independence, opposing colonialism, and safeguarding European and world peace. The Bulgarian people have always been concerned about maintaining peace and security in the Balkan region, and have taken many initiative measures in this regard. The recent proposal by the Bulgarian government to the Greek government to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries is the latest manifestation of this initiative spirit.

The Chinese people and the Bulgarian people have long had a deep and unbreakable fraternal friendship. However, the fraternal friendship and comprehensive mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and Bulgaria only truly began after the people of the two countries became the masters of their own countries. On October 4, 1949, China and Bulgaria established diplomatic relations. Over the past decade, the comprehensive mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Bulgaria in political, economic, and cultural fields has greatly developed. The two countries have signed cooperation agreements in trade, culture, science and technology, radio and television, plant protection, postal and telecommunications, thereby further consolidating and developing the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria.

The people of China and Bulgaria, united in the common socialist family and inspired by the great ideals of communism, are today advancing side by side on the socialist road with vigorous steps, realizing a great leap forward in the national economy. The fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and Bulgaria will inevitably be increasingly consolidated and developed with the rapid advancement of the socialist cause in the two countries, thereby making greater contributions to strengthening the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, consolidating world peace, and promoting the development of the cause of human progress.

    保加利亚人民的光辉节日
    中华人民共和国驻保加利亚人民共和国大使　朱其文
    1959年9月9日是保加利亚人民从法西斯暴政下获得解放的第十五周年的光辉节日。十五年前的这一天，保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，在苏联军队的决定性帮助下，举行了全民武装起义，推翻了保皇法西斯统治，建立了人民民主政权。1944年9月9日人民武装起义的胜利，是保加利亚历史中最光辉的一页，它永远结束了保加利亚人民受奴役受压迫的过去，开辟了保加利亚的新时代，人民和社会主义的时代。
    十五年来，热爱劳动的保加利亚人民，在光荣的保加利亚共产党的领导下，在伟大苏联的无私援助下，在同其他社会主义国家的互助合作下，保加利亚人民经过了两年国民经济的恢复后，从1949年至1957年又胜利地完成了两个五年经济建设计划，取得了重大的成就，根本改变了国民经济的落后状态，建立了社会主义社会的巩固基础。现在，保加利亚已经有了发达的工业，其中包括在技术上全新的重工业。过去一向仰赖进口的各种机器、黑色和有色金属、化学肥料和其他化工产品，现在不但能够自己生产，而且有的还向国外输出。1958年保加利亚工业总产值比解放前最高水平的1939年增加了七点八六倍。在短短的十几年中，已经把过去在工业发展方面处于相同水平的一些资本主义邻国远远地抛在后面了。例如，1956年，希腊的工业产量比1939年只增加90％，土耳其在同一时期只增加了一点三倍，而保加利亚却增加了五点七倍。
    保加利亚是继苏联之后在欧洲第二个完成农业社会主义改造的国家。保加利亚人民这样迅速地解决了社会主义建设中的这个复杂而困难的问题，是有理由引以自豪的。同时，也再一次生动地证实了社会主义思想的伟大创造力量。随着农业合作化的顺利完成，保加利亚的农业技术和农产品产量也有了显著的提高。目前，保加利亚农村有95％的翻耕、89％的播种、46％的收获和98％的脱粒工作已经机械化。农产品总值单在第二个五年计划期间（1953—1957年）就增长了25％。
    由于执行社会主义工业化、农业合作化、机械化政策的结果，保加利亚国民经济的结构有了本质的变化。在国民经济中，工业和农业总产值的对比，在农业总产值增长的同时，已经从1939年的二十四点八比七十五点二改变为1958年的六十九点九比三十点一。在工业中，重工业和轻工业产值的对比，在轻工业有巨大发展的同时，已经从1939年的二十三比七十七改变为1958年的四十五点八比五十四点二。今天，保加利亚已经以一个具有发达的工业和大规模合作化、机械化的农业的社会主义工业—农业国家屹立在巴尔干半岛的东端。
    随着国民经济的突飞猛进，保加利亚人民的物质和文化生活也有了显著的提高。1958年保加利亚国民收入比1939年增加了一倍半。在1956年4月保加利亚共产党中央委员会全会以后，党和政府又采取了一系列进一步改善人民生活的措施。现在，保加利亚全国人民享受着免费医疗待遇，职工都有工资照发的假期，国家还为农业生产合作社社员发放养老金。
    在建设社会主义经济的同时，保加利亚还实现了社会主义的文化革命。早在解放后的最初几年，就消灭了文盲。保加利亚的悠久文化真正成了全民的财产。文艺和科学也同国民经济的各个部门一样，处在空前高涨的时期。目前，保加利亚的学生、医生数量按人口平均计算都居于世界最先列。
    保加利亚人民在社会主义建设中取得的这些辉煌成就，不但大大加速了保加利亚人民前进的步伐，而且也加强了以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的力量。这些成就是保加利亚人民在社会主义体系和资本主义体系的和平竞赛中所作的巨大贡献。
    保加利亚人民以自豪的心情回顾了走过的道路，他们以更加自豪的心情展望着未来的前程。去年6月召开的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会，是保加利亚人民现代生活中的大事。它标志着保加利亚已经进入一个新的历史时期——建成社会主义和为逐步过渡到共产主义准备条件的时期。这次代表大会是作为社会主义取得彻底胜利的代表大会而载入史册的。它总结了保加利亚国内外自从保共“五大”和“六大”以来所发生的巨大变化，并且给了理论上的阐述；它还提出了将来的任务，通过了关于进一步建设社会主义的第三个五年计划的指示。
    保共“七大”的决议和关于第三个五年计划的指示，迅速成为保加利亚劳动人民的巨大鼓舞力量。超额完成生产任务的胜利消息，从全国各个角落传了出来。接着，保加利亚共产党及时地分析了保共“七大”以后所出现的加速社会主义建设的有利条件，就在去年的10月又向人民发出了新的战斗号召——提前完成第三个五年计划！这个适时的切合实际的号召，立即成为保加利亚劳动人民的行动指南。
    今年1月，保加利亚共产党中央委员会举行了全会，日夫科夫同志在会上作了关于“加速国民经济的发展、提高人民的物质生活和文化水平，以及改进国家领导和经济领导”的报告提纲。这次全会提出了1959—1962—1965年发展国民经济的规划，同时对国家和经济的领导工作提出了具有重大意义的改进意见。这个报告提纲已经在今年3月举行的国民议会第三次例会上进行了讨论，并且通过了相应的法律。报告规定：同第二个五年计划最后一年，即1957年相比，1962年的工业生产总值将增加一倍左右（保共“七大”通过的关于第三个五年计划的指示原规定只增加62％），到1965年将增加二倍到三倍；农业方面，1962年农产品总值将达到四百亿到四百五十亿列弗（较旧指标多约二百亿列弗），1965年将增加到六百亿列弗，即比1957年多三倍。
    在迅速发展生产的基础上，保加利亚人民的物质和文化生活水平也将有显著的提高。报告规定，同1957年相比，1962年国民收入将增加一倍多（旧指标规定增加50％），1965年将增加近二倍。1962年的人民消费量将比1957年增加约一倍（旧指标只规定增加40％），1965年将增加约一倍半。
    这是一个十分宏伟的跃进计划！为了实现这个经济上的大跃进，进一步贯彻执行国家生活中的列宁的民主集中制原则，使中央领导同地方机构和人民群众的主动性相结合、同劳动人民积极参加国家管理和经济领导相结合，保加利亚共产党和政府已经和准备采取一系列重大措施。例如，制定了新的行政经济区划，改组了国家机构，扩大了地方的权限，此外，还在农业、解放妇女劳动力、改进劳动报酬制度、和为克服城乡差异准备条件等方面制定了具体措施。实现上述计划和措施，将意味着保加利亚人民向共产主义的伟大目标大大前进一步。
    特别值得提到的是，去年冬季在实现了农业合作化的基础上所进行的一次全国规模的并社运动。这是保加利亚社会主义农业发展中具有伟大意义的事件。这一小社并大社的群众运动，仅仅几个月就胜利地完成了。到今年4月，全国农业生产合作社从三千二百九十二个并成为九百八十四个大型社，每个大型社拥有的农户都在一千户以上，而土地面积也从以前的五千到一万狄卡尔增加到四万到四万五千狄卡尔。
    扩大了的农业生产合作社为大规模兴修水利、更合理地安排农村经济的多种经营，更好地利用土地、劳动力和农业机器开辟了广阔的可能性，从而对农业生产的进一步增长起了积极的作用。例如从去年11月保加利亚人民在广大农村所开展的一个兴修水利的群众运动，到今年7月，全国农业合作社群众自己修建完成的水利工程就可以灌溉一百五十万狄卡尔土地，加上国家修建的水利工程一共可以灌溉一百七十万狄卡尔的土地。这就是说，在不到八个月的时间内所扩大的灌溉面积，就几乎比资产阶级统治六十五年所开辟的灌溉面积多四倍。今年保加利亚一天所增加的灌溉面积，就等于它解放前一年零四个月所扩大的灌溉面积的总和还要多。
    所有保加利亚人民获得的这些成就，不仅再一次证明社会主义制度的无比优越性，同时也说明，广大的劳动人民一旦真正掌握了自己的命运变成了社会主人的时候，就一定能够鼓足干劲，创造历史上的奇迹。
    必须指出：现在保加利亚人民的政治觉悟和劳动热情空前地提高了。当全国人民参加讨论提前完成第三个五年计划和保共中央一月全会报告提纲的时候，一共举行了数以万计的、将近全国一半的人参加大小会议，并以各种方式提出了三万八千条建议。全民讨论，这样一个领导联系群众和发挥人民的创造性主动性的好方法，已经成为保加利亚共产党的优良工作传统。
    今天，劳动在保加利亚同在其他社会主义国家一样，是光荣而豪迈的事业，它比任何时候都更受到人们的热爱和尊重。保加利亚政府去年年底作出了每个国家机关和群众团体的干部每年至少参加三十天的物质生产劳动的决定。农村干部广泛地种了试验田。许多作家、艺术家也下乡、下厂同劳动人民一道生活和劳动。此外，学生、市民参加公益义务劳动也更成为十分普遍的事情了。最近几个月来，保加利亚人民又掀起了更大的劳动高潮，以出色的劳动成绩来迎接伟大的十五周年国庆日，以忘我的劳动、冲天的干劲，为争取三、四年完成第三个五年计划而奋斗。
    在国内社会主义建设取得伟大成就的同时，保加利亚人民在国际生活中也取得了巨大的成就。保加利亚人民共和国的国际地位大大提高了。保加利亚人民是富有无产阶级国际主义、坚决反对帝国主义和大力支持民族独立运动的传统的人民。保加利亚共产党和政府为加强以苏联共产党为中心的世界共产主义运动和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，为反对以南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团为代表的现代修正主义和捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁，作出了卓越的贡献。在支持民族独立、反对殖民主义、保卫欧洲和世界和平的事业中，也作了不懈的努力。保加利亚人民一向关心维护巴尔干地区的和平和安全，并且在这方面采取了许多主动措施。最近保加利亚政府再次向希腊政府提出两国缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，就是这种主动精神的最新表现。
    中国人民和保加利亚人民早就有了深厚的牢不可破的兄弟友谊。但是，中保两国人民的兄弟友谊和全面的互助合作，在两国人民成了自己国家的主人之后才真正开始。1949年10月4日，中保两国建立了外交关系。十年来，中保两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的全面互助合作有了巨大的发展。两国间签订了贸易、文化、科学技术、广播电视、植物保护、邮政电讯等方面的合作协定，从而更加巩固和发展了中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊。
    团结在共同的社会主义大家庭中的、由共产主义的伟大理想所鼓舞的中保两国人民，今天正以矫健的步伐在社会主义大道上并肩前进，实现着国民经济的大跃进。中保两国人民的兄弟友谊和互助合作，必将随着两国社会主义事业的飞速前进而日益巩固和发展，从而为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营、巩固世界和平和促进人类进步事业的发展作出更大的贡献。
