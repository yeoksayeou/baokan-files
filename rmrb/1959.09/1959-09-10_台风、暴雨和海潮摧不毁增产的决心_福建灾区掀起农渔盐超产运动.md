Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th – The areas of Fujian Province that have been continuously hit by typhoons, rainstorms, and tidal surges have now properly resettled the disaster victims. Various productions in the disaster areas are rapidly recovering, and most of the damaged and flooded crops have been rescued and have resumed growth. Currently, the people's communes in the disaster areas, inspired by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have launched a magnificent overproduction campaign. The broad masses of commune members are determined to fight hard in September and October, striving for an all-round bumper harvest in autumn for fishing, salt production, and agriculture.

In the half-month from August 23rd to September 6th, the coastal counties of Fujian and parts of the inland areas were continuously hit by three typhoons and rainstorms and one tidal surge. During these natural disasters, losses were greatly reduced due to the concerted efforts of the Party, government, military, and people. However, due to the continuous onslaught of typhoons, rainstorms, and tidal surges, the momentum was too fierce, and many areas still suffered losses to varying degrees. According to statistics, in the disaster areas, more than 800,000 mu of late rice, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and other crops were blown down by the wind and submerged by floods, and the area of fruit trees broken by the wind and with fallen fruits was more than 100,000 mu.

The people in the disaster areas, who bravely resisted the typhoons, rainstorms, and tidal surges, immediately launched a production recovery and self-salvation movement under the leadership of the Party after the disaster. All localities are carrying out activities to support seedlings, wash seedlings, and apply fertilizer to the crops that have fallen or been flooded to promote crop growth. They are also vigorously washing away the salt from the fields that have been flooded by seawater to prevent salinization. Longxi County, one of the severely affected areas hit by a strong typhoon on August 23, has, through the heroic and tenacious struggle of the disaster area people in the past ten days, drained all 150,000 mu of late rice that were submerged in the county. More than 60,000 mu of land that had been immersed in seawater were washed with fresh water more than twice, and more than 1.3 million dan of refined fertilizer were applied to more than 100,000 mu of late rice fields. Now, the commune members in all communes of the county are rushing to plant late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes and sorghum. They are confidently expressing that they will strive for a bumper harvest in the severely affected areas and ensure overproduction in the lightly affected areas. The Xincuo Brigade of the Yuxi Commune in Fuqing County had 1,780 mu of late rice, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane damaged by typhoons and rainstorms, and it is estimated that it would lose 15,000 yuan. However, the commune members are still full of energy. They analyzed the favorable conditions, spared no effort to rescue the disaster-stricken crops, and carried out diversified operations. It is expected that not only will production not be reduced, but the output value can also be increased by 3,500 yuan compared with the original plan. Bailin Commune in Fuding County has launched a "seven-supplement" production increase campaign, such as using sweet potatoes to compensate for rice losses, vegetables to compensate for sweet potato losses, soybeans to compensate for jute losses, potatoes to compensate for sugarcane losses, winter to compensate for autumn losses, and lightly affected areas to compensate for severely affected areas. Now, the commune members are fighting with full confidence to recover all disaster losses.

The broad masses of commune members in the disaster-stricken economic crop areas have also actively engaged in rescue work. In Xianyou County, a major sugarcane production area in Fujian Province, after the typhoon, commune members in various communes immediately devoted themselves to the work of straightening sugarcane, tidying up plants, and applying fertilizer. After two days of hard work, more than 70,000 mu of sugarcane in the county were drained in time, and more than 20,000 mu of fallen sugarcane were all straightened. In order to make up for the loss of fruit caused by the typhoon, more than 5,800 commune members of the Jiuhu Commune in Longxi County immediately launched a "three-increase" and "three-strive" campaign after the typhoon to increase fertilizer, processing, and management of citrus fruits, and to strive for total output, weight per fruit, and quality, determined to ensure that the total output of citrus fruits reaches the original plan of 75,000 dan, and strive to overfulfill the target. After three days of hard work, the commune members raised more than 19,000 fallen trees, completed weeding of more than 2,500 mu of citrus orchards, applied fertilizer to 1,300 mu, and plowed more than 5,000 mu of lychee orchards.

The coastal fishing and salt production areas are also bustling with activity. "Riding on the wind of the Great Leap Forward, breaking through the waves of disaster, with tenacious fighting will, self-reliance, overcoming difficulties, and vowing to take back the wealth taken away by the typhoon!" This is the battle cry put forward by the fishermen in the coastal disaster areas. Now, the coastal fishermen are doing their best to repair and add fishing boats and fishing gear, and some have already set sail for production. In Pingtan County, under the increasingly hard work of more than 10,000 fishermen in the past two days, they have basically completed the preparations for going to sea, such as pushing the boats out of the sand (using sandbags in the cabin for wind protection). Fixed nets and seine nets in Fenwei, Yujian, Woqian, Xiaoyang, and other places were put into production on the second day after the typhoon; the three seine nets in Fenwei achieved initial success after the typhoon, and caught more than 1,800 jin of fish in one evening. More than 10,000 people were mobilized in Jinjiang County after the disaster to repair the oyster stones that had been knocked down by the wind and waves, and most of the oyster stones have now been turned over. The factory buildings of the Xiamen Fishing Gear Factory were blown down by the typhoon, and the workers produced fish hooks and ropes in the open air to support the fishermen in going to sea for production.

In the tense battle to restore production, the people's communes in the disaster areas have received enthusiastic support from the state and non-disaster areas. After the disaster occurred, the provincial leading organs have allocated 2.3 million yuan of agricultural loans to support the disaster-stricken communes in restoring production. The people's communes, handicraft cooperatives, and other departments along the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and Nanping-Fuzhou Railway actively organized manpower to rush to cut bamboo leaves, rush to cut mao bamboo, rush to transport firewood and charcoal, and transfer existing stocks of disaster relief materials, which were quickly transported to the disaster areas. The coastal fishing areas of Dongshan, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and other counties in non-disaster areas also transferred their fishing boats, fishing gear, and more than 300,000 jin of tung oil, jute, palm pieces, and more than 40,000 bamboo poles to support the brother fishermen in the disaster areas to quickly restore production. Fuzhou City and the Sanming Commune in the suburbs also organized a group of handicraft workers and construction workers to rush to Xiamen City to help the disaster victims rebuild their homes. With the help of the commune and the support of all parties, the disaster-stricken residents of Fuqing County repaired more than 2,200 damaged houses in one day.

With the active leadership and strong assistance of the Party and the government, the confidence of the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster has greatly increased. They expressed with great enthusiasm that they will use their tenacious fighting will, self-reliance, overcome all difficulties, and vow to take back all the wealth taken away by the typhoon.

    台风、暴雨和海潮摧不毁增产的决心
    福建灾区掀起农渔盐超产运动
    新华社福州8日电　福建省连续遭受台风暴雨和海潮袭击的地区，灾民生活已经得到妥善安置，灾区各项生产正在迅速恢复，被损坏和受淹的农作物，大部分已经抢救过来，恢复了生机。目前，灾区人民公社，在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，掀起了声势壮阔的超产运动大高潮，广大社员决心大战9、10月，力争秋季渔、盐、农业全面丰收。
    在8月23日到9月6日的半个月中，福建沿海各县和部分内陆地区，连续遭受了三次台风暴雨和一次大海潮的猛袭。在这些自然灾害袭来时，由于党政军民奋力抵抗，损失大大减轻。但是由于狂风暴雨和海潮接连袭来，来势太凶，不少地区仍然遭到了不同程度的损失。据统计，受灾地区被风刮坏和大水淹没的晚稻、甘薯、甘蔗等共达八十多万亩，果树被风折断和落果的面积有十多万亩。
    在台风暴雨和海潮袭击中进行了英勇抵抗的灾区人民，灾后，在党的领导下立即掀起了恢复生产和生产自救运动。各地对倒伏和受淹的农作物，都进行扶苗洗苗和追施肥料，促进作物生长；对被海水淹过的田地，大力进行洗咸，不使返咸成灾。8月23日遭受强台风袭击的重灾区之一龙溪县，十天来经过灾区人民英勇顽强的战斗，全县受淹的十五万多亩晚稻都已进行了开沟排水，被海水浸过的六万多亩地，都用淡水洗苗二次以上，并在十万多亩的晚稻田里追施了一百三十多万担精肥。现在全县各公社社员正抢种甘薯、高粱等晚秋作物，他们信心百倍地表示，要重灾争丰收，轻灾保超产。福清县渔溪公社新厝大队有一千七百八十亩晚稻、甘薯、甘蔗遭到台风暴雨危害，估计要损失一万五千元，但社员们仍然鼓足干劲，他们分析了有利条件，全力抢救受灾作物，并开展了多种经营，预计这样不但不会减产，还可比原订产值增收三千五百元。福鼎县白琳公社开展水稻损失补甘薯、甘薯损失补蔬菜、黄麻损失补大豆、甘蔗损失补马铃薯、秋季损失冬季补、重灾损失轻灾补等“七补”增产运动，现在社员正满怀信心为夺回全部受灾损失而奋战。
    受灾的经济作物区的广大社员也积极投入抢救工作。福建省甘蔗主要产区的仙游县，台风过后，各公社社员立即投入甘蔗扶正整株补肥工作。经过两天苦战，全县七万多亩甘蔗及时排干了水，两万多亩倒伏的全部扶正。龙溪县九湖公社为了弥补台风中造成的果树落果损失，台风过后，五千八百多名社员，立即投入了柑桔加肥、加工、加管理和争总产量、争粒重、争质量的“三加”“三争”运动，决心确保柑桔总产量达到原计划七万五千担，并力争超额完成。经过三天苦战，全社扶起倒树一万九千多株，完成柑桔园除草两千五百亩，施肥一千三百亩，犁荔枝园五千多亩。
    沿海鱼盐产区也搞得热火朝天。“乘跃进之风，破灾害之浪，以顽强的斗争意志，自力更生，克服困难，誓把台风夺去的财富夺回来！”这是沿海灾区渔民提出的战斗口号。现在沿海渔民们正全力抢修和添置渔船渔具，有的已扬帆出海生产。平潭县两天来在一万多渔民日益苦战下，基本完成了推船出沙（因防风用沙袋装在船舱里）等下海准备工作。芬尾、裕建、沃前、小痒等地的定置网和缯仔，在风后第二天即挂网生产；芬尾的三部缯仔，风后首战告捷，一个傍晚即捕鱼一千八百多斤。晋江县灾后出动了一万多人抢修被风浪刮倒的蛎石，现在大部分蛎石已经翻好。厦门市渔具厂厂房被台风刮倒了，工人们就在露天里生产鱼钩、绳索，支援渔民出海生产。
    灾区人民公社在恢复生产的紧张战斗中，得到了国家和非灾区的热情支援。灾情发生后，省领导机关已拨出二百三十万元农业贷款，支援受灾公社恢复生产。鹰厦铁路和南福铁路沿线山区人民公社、手工业社和其他部门，都积极组织人力抢割竹叶、抢砍毛竹、抢运柴炭和调出现有库存的救灾物资，火速运往灾区。非灾区的东山、诏安、云霄等县的沿海渔区，还纷纷抽调自己的渔船、渔具和三十多万斤桐油、黄麻、棕片和四万多根竹竿，支援灾区兄弟渔民迅速恢复生产。福州市和郊区三明公社并组织一批手工业工人和建筑工人，赶赴厦门市帮助灾民重建家园。福清县受灾居民在公社帮助和各方面支援下，一天中就抢修了两千二百多家被损坏的房屋。
    在党和政府积极领导和大力帮助下，灾区人民战胜灾害的信心大增。他们干劲十足地表示，要以顽强的斗争意志，自力更生，克服一切困难，誓把台风夺走的财富全部夺回来。
