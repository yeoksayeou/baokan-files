Academic and Cultural Trends

Soviet Historians Study the History of Socialist Thought

Currently, bourgeois philosophers and historians are doing their utmost to distort and fabricate the history of socialist thought, attempting to weaken the growing influence of Marxism-Leninism among the broad working people of the world. Therefore, Marxist-Leninist historians must use serious scientific works to give them a merciless rebuff. Last year, the Institute of History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences established a group for the study of the history of socialist thought within its Department of Modern History. After its establishment, this group immediately began its work and published the works of the predecessors of scientific socialism. These publications laid a reliable foundation for the study of various viewpoints on the history of socialist thought, especially for the study of the period before the emergence of scientific socialism.

The Socialist Thought History Group is led by Professor B.F. Porshnev. A scientific conference commemorating the 75th anniversary of Marx's death was held last year, and several academic conferences have also been held this year.

On February 24, the Socialist Thought History Group held a meeting to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Owen's death. Academician A.M. Deborin, in his report, discussed Owen's theory as one of the pioneers of scientific communism. He emphasized that Owen's following ideas are particularly worthy of attention: the elimination of capitalist slavery, the development of science and technology, the correct combination of individual material desires with social interests in the development of human society, and the role of labor in the all-round development of people, etc.

From February 27 to March 6, the Department of Medieval History, the Italian History Group, and the Socialist Thought History Group of the Institute of History jointly held an academic conference to discuss Campanella's thought. Chicolini, in his report "Utopian Socialism in Sixteenth-Century Italy and Campanella," pointed out that Campanella was not a lonely thinker isolated from the social and intellectual life of Italy in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He was closely related to the pioneers and contemporaries representing the utopian socialist thought trend in Italian social thought, such as Doni, Alibergaqi, Agosqi, and Flamini.

On March 31, the Socialist Thought History Group listened to I.I. Zilberfarb's report "Research on the History of Socialist Thought After World War II." Later, the group listened to several thematic reports, including Ye. P. Konger's "'True' Socialism in Germany," M.A. Barg's "Social Thought of the Communist Movement in Seventeenth-Century England," and F.M. Darlin's "Babeuf on the Eve of the French Bourgeois Revolution at the End of the Eighteenth Century." These meetings conducted heated discussions on the above academic reports and are preparing to publish a collection of essays on the history of socialist thought.

The Ministry of Health's Pharmacopoeia Committee Compiles a New Draft of the Pharmacopoeia

Under the leadership of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Health, a new draft of the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China has been completed by the Pharmacopoeia Committee in cooperation with relevant units in various regions. In early July, the Ministry of Health convened the Third Plenary Committee Meeting of the Pharmacopoeia Committee. After ten days of group discussions, the meeting reviewed the new draft of the Pharmacopoeia and put forward opinions for supplementation and modification.

The new draft of the Pharmacopoeia contains more than 1,300 drugs, more than double the number in the 1953 edition. Among them, traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions account for more than 51% of all drugs. In addition to summarizing the experience and achievements in production, inspection, and supply, the content of the new draft of the Pharmacopoeia also briefly records the theories and experiences that have been mastered in terms of usage.

    苏联史学家研究社会主义思想史
    目前，资产阶级的哲学家和史学家们正在极力歪曲和捏造社会主义思想史，妄图削弱马克思列宁主义在全世界广大劳动人民中日益增长的影响，因此，马克思列宁主义的历史学家必须用严正的科学著作给他们以无情的反击。去年，苏联科学院历史研究所在近代史部门内成立了一个研究社会主义思想史的小组。这个小组在成立后即开展了工作，并出版了科学社会主义的前辈们的著作。这些出版物给专门研究社会主义思想史的各种观点，特别是给研究科学社会主义产生以前的时期打下了可靠的基础。
    社会主义思想史组是由波·弗·波尔什涅夫教授领导的。去年举行过纪念马克思逝世七十五周年的科学会议，今年也举行过多次学术会议。
    2月24日，社会主义思想史组举行了纪念欧文逝世一百周年的会议。阿·玛·杰波林院士在他的报告中论述了作为科学共产主义先驱者之一的欧文的学说。他着重地指出，欧文的下述思想是值得特别重视的：消灭资本主义奴隶制，发展科学技术，在人类社会发展中使个人的物质欲望同社会利益正确地结合起来，以及劳动对全面地培养人的作用，等等。
    2月27日至3月6日，历史研究所的中世纪史部门、意大利史组和社会主义思想史组，联合举行了一次讨论康帕内拉思想的学术会议。契科利尼在其“十六世纪意大利的乌托邦社会主义和康帕内拉”的报告中指出，康帕内拉并不是一个同十六世纪末至十七世纪初意大利的社会生活和思想生活隔绝的孤独的思想家，他同代表意大利社会思想中乌托邦社会主义思潮的先驱者和当代人如多尼、阿利别尔加契、阿果斯契和弗拉米尼等都有密切的联系。
    3月31日，社会主义思想史组听取了依·依·齐利别尔法尔勃的“研究第二次世界大战后的社会主义思想史”的报告。以后，该组又听取了耶·普·康杰尔的“德国‘真正的’社会主义”、玛·阿·巴尔格的“英国十七世纪共产运动的社会思想”和费·玛·达林的“十八世纪末法国资产阶级革命前夕的巴贝夫”等几个专题报告。这些会议对以上学术报告都进行了热烈的讨论，并准备出版一本社会主义思想史的论文集。
    卫生部药典委员会编成新版药典草案
    一部新的中华人民共和国药典草案，已在卫生部党组党委的领导下，由药典委员会与各地有关单位协作完成了。7月上旬，卫生部召开药典委员会第三次全体委员会议。会议经过了十天的分组讨论，对新版药典草案进行了审查，并且提出了补充修改的意见。
    新版药典草案共收载药品一千三百多种，较1953年版药典增加了一倍多，其中中药成方占全部药品51％以上。新版药典草案的内容，除总结生产、检验和供应方面的经验和成果规定外，还简要地记载了使用方面已经掌握的理论和经验。
