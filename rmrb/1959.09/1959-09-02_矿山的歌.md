    Songs of the Mine
    We are jackhammer operators,
    The coal face is the underground spring,
    Coal chunks whirl around under the jackhammer,
    Like black peonies blooming,
    The jackhammer sings a song of steel.
    Coal mountains are driven out of the ground,
    Jackhammer operators send warmth to the world,
    Ah! We have extraordinary hands,
    In our hands is a magical mountain-driving whip.
                      Deng Ping
    Wind Drill
    Wind drill, wind drill, truly capable,
    Day and night, it's always calling.
    Stand up straight, constantly moving forward,
    It's in a great battle with the rocks.
    Drilling into the rock core, digging out coal,
    Sending it to the blast furnace to smelt iron.
                    Ma Tianhong
    Good Miner
    Good miner, good miner,
    The miner goes down the well to dig for treasure,
    Sending the treasure to the blast furnace to eat,
    The blast furnace grins and laughs,
                 Hao Laibao
    Ode to Coal Mining
    Underground deity, underground deity,
    Holding a jackhammer to mine the coal seam;
    The jackhammer drills with a rapid beat,
    The coal seam makes way, spewing smoke and clouds.
    Dust rises, smoke and clouds churn,
    The underground deity drills in the ground;
    Coming in blue clothes and pants,
    Leaving in black clothes.
    Underground deity, underground deity,
    Good at singing and dancing, capable in every way,
    Waving, swaying, bending, lifting, graceful dance,
    Pī, Bù, Dū, Tū, playing in harmony;
    Actors singing and dancing, instruments accompanying,
    Miners singing and dancing, accompanying the coal seam;
    The coal seam sings and dances, the mountain shakes,
    Offering the underground city of black gold.
                      Gao Zhiyong
    We're the Ones Who Will Dig Through the Earth
    Rumbling and roaring, misty and foggy,
    Coal and rocks flying, earth collapsing and mountains crumbling.
    The rock is hard, but it fears determination;
    Yesterday one foot, today hundreds of inches.
    Eyes aiming deep, cannon firing accurately;
    The stone gate wide open, we advance!
    Who takes the lead in mining black gold?
    We're the ones who will dig through the earth!

    矿山的歌
    我们是风镐手
    碛头面就是地下的春天，
    煤块在风镐下团团飞旋，
    像一朵朵黑色牡丹开放，
    风镐唱着钢铁般的歌声。
    一座座煤山被赶出地面，
    风镐手把温暖送往人间，
    啊！我们有一双非凡的手，
    手里有一支神奇的赶山鞭。
                      邓平
    风钻
    风钻风钻，真正能干，
    白天黑夜，都在叫唤。
    挺起腰杆，不断向前，
    他同岩石，一场大战。
    钻进岩心，挖出煤炭，
    送进高炉，把铁来炼。
                    马天洪
    矿工好
    矿工好，矿工好，
    矿工下井去挖宝，
    把宝送给高炉吃，
    高炉咧嘴哈哈笑，
                 郝来宝
    采煤颂
    地下神来地下神，
    手拿风镐采煤层；
    风镐钻得突突叫，
    煤层让路吐烟云。
    灰尘起、烟云翻，
    地下神在地里钻；
    来时穿的蓝衣裤，
    去时变成黑衣衫。
    地下神来地下神，
    善歌善舞样样能，
    摇、摆、俯、仰舞姿好，
    ?、咘、嘟、突奏和声；
    演员歌舞器乐伴，
    矿工歌舞伴煤层；
    煤层歌舞山摇动，
    献出地下乌金城。
                      高志勇
    挖穿地球就靠我们
    轰轰隆隆，烟雾蒙蒙，
    煤石飞滚，地塌山崩。
    岩石坚硬，就怕决心；
    昨天一尺，今天百寸。
    眼打得深，炮轰得准；
    石门大开，我们前进！
    要采乌金，谁打先锋？
    挖穿地球，就靠我们！
                      蓝田
