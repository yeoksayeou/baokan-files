Japan's Latent Imperialist Foreign Policy Program
—A Review of Japan's Third Diplomatic Blue Book
                             Zhou Yayi

    In May of this year, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs released its third blue book entitled "Recent Situation of Our Country's Diplomacy." The book goes to great lengths to offer clumsy cover and justification for the Kishi Nobusuke government's alignment with the United States, its new military collusion with the United States through the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and its implementation of foreign expansion. At the same time, it employs the trick of inverting right and wrong and distorting facts in an attempt to conceal its hostile policy towards China, confuse the public, and deceive public opinion.

    (I)
    At the beginning of the blue book, in the section on "Evolving International Situation," following the absurd fallacies of the United States, it does its utmost to slander and defame, attempting to diminish the far-reaching influence of the peaceful diplomatic policies of China and the Soviet Union. After reviewing the international situation of the past year, it announced the basic diplomatic line of the Kishi Nobusuke government. For the reader's convenience, we quote a passage from the blue book:
    "Considering our country's domestic and international situation calmly, it is quite clear that it is impossible to exist independently as a free and democratic nation while taking a neutral stance outside of the currently opposed two forces. Therefore, on the one hand, our country will cultivate its self-defense capabilities, and on the other hand, it will maintain the security guarantee system with the United States for self-defense. This is the basic diplomatic line that our country must take at present, as required by our national conditions and the world situation."
    This time, the Kishi Nobusuke government put away the so-called "three principles of diplomacy" that it had been touting for the past year or two—"centering on the United Nations, cooperating with free nations, and adhering to the position of an Asian member"—and directly announced that it was wholeheartedly relying on the United States to further strengthen U.S.-Japan military collusion.
    Relying on the United States, reviving militarism, and attempting to make a comeback has been the consistent policy of the Japanese ruling clique since the war. For more than a decade, Japanese monopoly capital has taken advantage of U.S. support and made a bloody fortune from the Korean War, gradually growing stronger. The Kishi Nobusuke government, representing the latent imperialist ambitions of Japanese monopoly capital, has been constantly clamoring since taking office that U.S.-Japan relations have entered a "new era." What kind of new era is this? This is to establish a new aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union under the guise of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," to put a legal cloak on the continued military occupation by the United States, and to undertake more military obligations to the United States, in exchange for U.S. support for its foreign expansion. The Kishi Nobusuke group's emphasis on adding the so-called "economic cooperation" issue to the revised U.S.-Japan military treaty precisely illustrates this point.
    Under the guise of "strengthening self-defense" and "opposing aggression," the Kishi Nobusuke government is also preparing to expand the Japanese army to 350,000 men (not counting the 130,000 fully armed Japanese police), openly clamoring that Japan can conduct nuclear armament, send troops abroad, cooperate with the U.S. military in combat, and jointly act with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee groups. In fact, it will form a Northeast Asian military group and link up with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, serving as the main U.S. aggressor accomplice in Asia, in exchange for U.S. support, accumulating strength, and reliving the dream of dominating Asia. Therefore, the Kishi government, disregarding the strong desire of the Japanese people for peace and neutrality, brazenly announced that it will never take a neutral stance, and shed the mask that it once used to flaunt everywhere, that Japan is a "member of Asia and Africa," and declared nakedly that it stands with the U.S. imperialists, the enemy of the Asian and African people, and embarks on the road of war and aggression. The recent joint military exercises between the Japanese army and the U.S. Seventh Fleet, openly provoking peace-loving Asian people, cannot but arouse serious vigilance.

    (II)
    The blue book also brazenly states that Japan's proclaimed "economic cooperation" with Asian and African countries is to carry out colonialist economic plunder in economically underdeveloped regions. This document states that "the United States has the traditional market of Central and South America," "the United Kingdom controls the British Commonwealth preferential zone," and "the Asian continent, Japan's traditional market, has undergone fundamental changes after the war." Japan must develop "undeveloped countries" to establish a stable market for Japan. It is clear that the Japanese monopoly group, full of latent imperialist ambitions, has already launched a battle for spheres of influence, attempting to turn Southeast Asia and other regions into Japan's sphere of influence, just as the United States oppresses and enslaves the people of Latin America and as the United Kingdom controls and exploits the countries of the British Commonwealth, plundering the wealth and resources of Southeast Asia. Recently, Kishi Nobusuke visited Western Europe, boasting everywhere that Japan is the "center of free Asia," shamelessly posing as the leader of Asia. The "Asian Development Fund Plan" planned by Kishi Nobusuke since taking office and his repeated calls for the establishment of an "Asian broad economic sphere" and an "Asian common market" are all conspiratorial means for Japanese latent imperialism to dream of rebuilding the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and are by no means "moving towards the higher goal of improving human welfare while seeking its own development."
    In recent years, the Kishi Nobusuke government has stepped up its expansion into Southeast Asia. Japan's exports to Southeast Asia have increased by approximately $100 million annually, and there is often a trade surplus. The proportion of Japan's total exports accounted for 19% before the war and increased to 27% in 1957. Japan's investment in Asia and Africa has increased sharply, with a cumulative increase of six times in 1958 compared to 1955.
    The blue book also reveals that Japanese monopoly capital still remembers its so-called "traditional market of the Asian continent"—the Chinese market. The "continental policy" of aggression against China and the "southward advance policy" of aggression against Southeast Asia were originally two related steps in the Japanese imperialists' delusion of establishing world hegemony. Kishi Nobusuke was one of the executors of this bandit policy. Whether it was the "continental policy" or the "southward advance policy," they have been completely bankrupt after being battered by the Chinese people and the Asian people. However, the blue book once again shows that the aggressive Japanese imperialist elements have not given up their ambitions, and they are trying to rely on U.S. support to retrace this old road of aggression. The Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries must maintain sufficient vigilance against this.

    (III)
    After the war, the reactionary Japanese government has consistently followed the United States and adopted a hostile attitude towards New China. In April 1952, the Yoshida government, following the wishes of its U.S. masters, signed a so-called "peace treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group despised by the Chinese people, colluding with the U.S. and Chiang and openly becoming an enemy of the Chinese people. After Kishi Nobusuke came to power, his words and deeds hostile to China became even more intensified. In 1957, Kishi Nobusuke visited Taiwan and openly supported the Chiang gang's "counterattack against the mainland"; followed the United States in creating the "two Chinas" conspiracy; and raised the so-called "Taiwan Independence League" Liao Wenyi traitorous group, attempting to interfere in China's Taiwan. During the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait last year, Kishi Nobusuke slandered China as the "aggressor of Jinmen and Mazu" and clamored that "Taiwan must never be allowed to fall into the hands of the communists." At the beginning of this year, Ohno Banboku, the vice president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, brazenly clamored for the formation of a "United States of Japan" including Taiwan and South Korea, dreaming of annexing China's sacred territory of Taiwan.
    Kishi Nobusuke also maliciously slandered that "the Chinese Communist Party is trying to infiltrate the entire Asia," attempting to provoke relations between China and Southeast Asian countries, serve the U.S. imperialists, undermine the anti-colonialist movement in Asian countries, and create convenience for Japan to promote its expansionist policies.
    On the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, the Kishi Nobusuke government played a vicious two-faced trick, trying to gain economic benefits and political capital from it, while treating China with an imperialist attitude, colluding with the U.S. and Chiang, destroying the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement, and condoning thugs to create an incident insulting China's national flag. After that, Kishi Nobusuke more arrogantly put forward the fallacy of so-called "separation of politics and economics" in dealing with Sino-Japanese relations, openly advocating that he would adhere to hostility towards China in politics, only gain benefits from Sino-Japanese trade, and serve the expansionist desires of Japanese monopoly capital.
    This series of blatant and systematic words and deeds of the Kishi Nobusuke government that are hostile to China completely expose that under the slogans of anti-communism and anti-China, it is stepping up its collusion with the United States, reviving militarism, and dragging Japan onto the destructive road of war. Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policy of hostility towards China has not only been strongly condemned by the Chinese people, but has also aroused strong opposition from the vast number of Japanese people, as well as the doubts and dissatisfaction of enlightened people within the Liberal Democratic Party. Therefore, whenever there is an election in Japan or other opportunities that can be used, Kishi Nobusuke will play a set of tricks on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations to cover up and quibble for his policy of hostility towards China, attempting to confuse the public and alleviate the pressure of the Japanese people. The blue book does its utmost to distort and slander the issue of Sino-Japanese relations. It describes Kishi Nobusuke's extremely hostile policy towards China as implementing the policy of "good-neighborliness and friendship," and describes the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations and the interruption of trade caused by the Kishi government's blatant words and deeds hostile to China as being due to "unfounded misunderstandings," attempting to push the responsibility onto China. At the same time, he falsely talks about "respecting each other's government's position, adhering to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, and opening up Sino-Japanese relations with goodwill and sincerity." These are all sky-high lies that distort the facts. The lengthy speeches and actions of Kishi Nobusuke that are hostile to China are not only blatant interference in China's internal affairs, but also full of aggressive ambitions towards China. Not only that, but this set of rhetoric in the blue book has a more vicious intention. According to Kishi Nobusuke's gangster-style logic, Japan follows the United States, maintains "diplomatic relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek group, and is hostile to the Chinese people. This is the position of the Japanese government. The Chinese people express their righteous and stern attitude, that is not to "respect" the position of the Japanese government. The U.S.-Japan military alliance, which aims to invade China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries under the name of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," is Japan's "internal affairs." As Japan's neighbor, China is seriously vigilant against the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Japanese potential imperialism to collude with each other and threaten China and Asian peace based on the painful memories of Japanese militarism's 60-year invasion of China, that is "interfering" in Japan's internal affairs. Attempting to put rouge on the hideous face of latent imperialism and put on a deceptive mask is the real purpose of the blue book's talk of "respect" and "non-interference."
    Despite the blue book's attempt to beautify Kishi Nobusuke, Kishi Nobusuke himself can no longer hide his hideous face of hostility towards China. Recently, after Kishi Nobusuke visited Western Europe, he repeatedly clamored that his absurd proposition of "separation of politics and economics" has been supported by some politicians in Britain and West Germany, and his attitude of hostility towards China has become more rampant. The Chinese people have always held a friendly and supportive attitude towards the Japanese people in the past and still hold it today, and have always advocated establishing good-neighborly friendship and equal and mutually beneficial relations with Japan based on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and have made many efforts for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. However, for the Kishi Nobusuke and his ilk who are determined to treat China with an imperialist attitude, the Chinese people understand how to "treat them in the same way they treat others."

    (IV)
    To sum up, Japan's Third Diplomatic Blue Book systematically presents the Kishi Nobusuke government's latent imperialist diplomatic program of further colluding with the United States, accelerating rearmament, being hostile to China and the Soviet Union, and expanding and invading Asia, Africa, and other regions. Relying on a powerful imperialism, implementing the poisonous trick of distant alliances and near attacks to realize one's own aggressive ambitions has been the consistent trick of Japanese imperialists since the Meiji Restoration. Kishi Nobusuke, one of the initiators of the Pacific War and a war criminal, is still trying to take this old path with the "basic line" of diplomacy he is currently taking. The Kishi government is currently negotiating with the United States to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," further selling itself into the U.S. war system, acting according to the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of "using Asians to fight Asians," attempting to drive the Japanese people to act as the vanguard and cannon fodder for the United States to attack the Asian people, and making a fortune from the tragedy of the bloodshed of the Asian people. One day, the Japanese militarist elements will take a ride on the U.S. aggressive chariot and carry out military expansion against Asian countries to realize their arrogant plan to restore imperialism. Kishi Nobusuke's wolfish ambitions cannot but arouse serious vigilance and resolute opposition from the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the entire Asian people.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's dragging Japan onto the imperialist future is not a pleasant one. Looking at the entire international situation, today is an era where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The development of socialism throughout the world is like the rising sun in the east, while imperialism is indeed declining. If, twenty years ago, when socialism had only achieved victory in one country, imperialism was still able to run rampant for a while, and the Japanese imperialists' dream of dominating Asia was not fulfilled, then today, when the socialist camp has become increasingly strong, united, and consolidated, and has gained an advantage over imperialism, Japanese militarist elements should not dream of reliving the old dream of imperialism. At the same time, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging and constantly rising. Many countries in Asia have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression and have fresh memories of the heinous crimes of Japanese militarism. Today, they are fighting to win and defend their national independence and can expect to receive friendly cooperation from socialist countries. Therefore, they will never allow the Japanese monopoly group to collude with the United States to carry out expansion and aggression against them in new ways. If the Japanese militarist elements are obsessed with their own ideas and follow the United States on the road of aggressive war, the result will inevitably be a collision with their heads broken and bleeding, and end up as a mere burial object. Only by adopting a peaceful and neutral path, abandoning the ambitions of imperialist expansion and aggression, and carrying out friendly cooperation with Asian and African countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is the only bright path for Japan. At present, the Japanese people's movement against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," striving for independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and Sino-Japanese friendship, is developing vigorously like a prairie fire, demonstrating the Japanese people's unwavering determination to strive for peace and oppose war. The Chinese people will do everything in their power and unswervingly support the Japanese people's just struggle, and firmly believe that the Japanese people will unite as one, overcome all obstacles and difficulties, and achieve final victory.

    日本潜在帝国主义的外交纲领
    ——评日本第三号外交蓝皮书
                             周亚毅
    今年5月，日本外务省第三次发表了题为“我国外交近况”的蓝皮书，为岸信介政府投靠美国，通过修改日美“安全条约”同美国进行新的军事勾结，实行对外扩张，大费笔墨，进行拙劣的掩饰和辩护。同时玩弄颠倒是非、歪曲事实的手法，妄图掩盖其敌视中国的政策，混淆视听，欺骗舆论。	（一）
    蓝皮书一开头，在“国际形势的演变”部分，按照美国荒诞的谬论，极尽中伤与诽谤的能事，力图贬低中苏和平外交政策的深远影响，追述了去年的国际形势之后，宣布了岸信介政府的基本外交路线。为了读者的方便，我们引用蓝皮书的一段：
    “冷静地考虑到我国的国内外形势，在目前对立的两种势力之外，采取中立的立场，是不可能成为自由民主主义国家而单独存在的，这是至为明显的。因此，我国一方面培植自卫力量，另一方面，维持同美国之间的安全保障体制，以用自卫。这是我国国情和世界形势要求我国目前采取的外交基本路线”。
    岸信介政府这次收起了近一、两年来它所标榜的所谓“以联合国为中心，同自由国家合作、坚持亚洲成员的立场”的“外交三原则”，直截了当地宣布它死心塌地投靠美国，进一步加强美日军事勾结。
    依附美国，复活军国主义，企图东山再起，这原是战后日本统治集团的一贯政策。十几年来，日本垄断资本利用美国的扶植，并从朝鲜战争中发了一笔血腥的横财，羽翼渐丰。代表日本垄断资本潜在帝国主义野心的岸信介政府，自从上台以来，不断叫嚷日美关系进入“新时代”。什么样的新时代呢？这就是用修改日美“安全条约”的名义，订立敌视中苏的侵略性的新的美日军事同盟条约，使美国的继续军事占领披上合法外衣，向美国承担更多的军事义务，借以换取美国对其对外扩张给予支持。岸信介集团强调在修改后的美日军事条约中，加进所谓“经济合作”问题，正是说明这一点。
    岸信介政府还在“加强自卫”、“反对侵略”等等词句的掩盖下，准备把日军扩充到三十五万人（日本全副武装的警察十三万人不算在内），公然叫嚣日本得以进行核武装，派兵出国、协同美军作战，同蒋介石、李承晚集团联合行动，事实上组成东北亚军事集团，并同东南亚军事条约联系起来，充当美国在亚洲的主要侵略帮凶，换取美国扶持，积蓄力量，重温称霸亚洲的迷梦。因此，岸政府不顾日本人民要求和平中立的强烈愿望，悍然宣布它绝不采取中立的立场，并卸下它曾经借以到处招摇撞骗的日本是“亚非一员”的假面具，赤裸裸地宣告它同亚非人民的敌人美帝国主义站在一起，走向战争和侵略的道路。最近日军同美国第七舰队举行联合军事演习，公开向爱好和平的亚洲人民进行挑衅，这不能不引起人们的严重警惕。	（二）
    蓝皮书还明目张胆地说出了日本所宣传的同亚非国家进行“经济合作”，就是向经济比较落后的地区实行殖民主义的经济掠夺。这个文件中说道：“美国拥有中南美传统市场”，
  “英国掌握着英联邦特惠区”，“而日本传统市场的亚洲大陆，在战后发生了根本变化”，日本必须开发“未开发国家”，以建立日本的稳定市场。显而易见，满怀潜在帝国主义野心的日本垄断集团，已经摆开了争夺势力范围的阵势，妄图把东南亚等地区变为日本的势力圈，就像美国压迫、奴役拉丁美洲人民那样，像英国控制、剥削英联邦国家那样，搜刮东南亚的财富和脂膏。最近岸信介访问西欧，到处吹嘘日本是“自由亚洲的中心”，恬不知耻地以亚洲盟主自居。岸信介上台以来所策划的“亚洲开发基金计划”以及它一再叫嚷的建立“亚洲广域经济圈”和“亚洲共同市场”等等，都是日本潜在帝国主义梦想重建“大东亚共荣圈”的阴谋手段，绝不是什么“在谋取自身发展的同时，也应向增进人类福祉这一更高目标迈进”的。
    近年来，岸信介政府加紧向东南亚扩张，日本对东南亚地区出口每年约增一亿美元，而且经常是出超，占日本出口总额比重战前为19％，1957年增至27％。日本对亚非地区的投资急剧增加，1958年累计比1955年增长六倍。
    蓝皮书也流露了日本垄断资本还念念不忘其所谓“亚洲大陆传统市场”——中国市场。以侵略中国为内容的“大陆政策”和侵略东南亚的“南进政策”，本是战前日本帝国主义妄想建立世界霸权的两个相关联的步骤，岸信介就是这项强盗政策的执行人之一。“大陆政策”也好，“南进政策”也好，在中国人民和亚洲人民的打击下，已经碰得头破血流而彻底破产。但是蓝皮书再一次表明，侵略成性的日本帝国主义分子野心未死，企图借助美国的扶持，重走这条侵略老路。中国人民和其它亚洲国家人民，对此不能不保持足够的警惕。	（三）
    战后日本反动政府一贯追随美国，对新中国采取敌视态度。1952年4月，吉田政府顺从美国主子的意旨，同中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“和约”，勾结美蒋，公开与中国人民为敌。岸信介上台后，敌视中国的言行变本加厉。1957年岸信介走访台湾，公然支持蒋帮“反攻大陆”；追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋；豢养所谓“台湾独立同盟”廖文毅叛国集团，妄图染指我国台湾。去年台湾海峡紧张局势当中，岸信介污蔑中国是“金门和马祖的侵略者”，并叫嚣“绝不容许台湾落入共产党人手中”。今年初，日本自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦竟肆无忌惮地叫嚷要组成包括台湾和南朝鲜在内的“日本合众国”，妄想吞并中国的神圣领土台湾。
    岸信介还恶意污蔑“中国共产党试图渗入整个亚洲”，企图挑拨中国同东南亚国家的关系，替美国帝国主义效劳，破坏亚洲国家反殖民主义运动，为日本推行扩张政策开方便之门。
    在中日贸易问题上，岸信介政府玩弄恶毒的两面手法，既想从中捞取经济实惠和政治资本，又以帝国主义态度对待中国，与美蒋勾结，破坏第四次中日贸易协定，并纵容暴徒，制造侮辱我国国旗事件。此后岸信介更狂妄地提出了对中日关系问题要采取所谓“政治和经济分开”的谬论，公然主张在政治上坚持敌视中国，只从中日贸易捞取实惠，为日本垄断资本的扩张欲望服务。
    岸信介政府这一系列露骨的、有系统的敌视中国的言行，完全暴露了它在反共、反华的口号下，加紧勾结美国，复活军国主义，把日本拖入战争的毁灭道路。岸信介敌视中国的反动政策不仅遭到中国人民的严正谴责，同时也引起广大日本人民的强烈反对，以及自由民主党内有识之士的疑虑和不满。因此，岸信介每逢日本有什么选举或则可以利用的其他机会，便要在中日关系问题上耍一套花腔，为其敌视中国的政策掩饰和狡辩，企图混淆视听，缓和日本人民的压力。蓝皮书对中日关系问题，就是极尽歪曲与污蔑的能事的。它把岸信介极端敌视中国的政策，说成是执行“善邻友好”的方针，把因为岸政府露骨地敌视中国的言行所造成的中日关系的恶化和贸易中断，说成是由于“无根据的误解”，妄图把责任推到我国头上。同时又妄谈“互相尊重政府的立场，坚持不干涉内政的原则，以善意和诚意打开中日关系”。这些都是颠倒黑白的弥天大谎。岸信介发表的连篇累牍的敌视中国的言行不仅是露骨的干涉中国内政，而且充满了对中国的侵略野心。不仅如此，蓝皮书的这一套花言巧语，还有更恶毒的用心。依照岸信介的强盗式逻辑，日本追随美国，同蒋介石集团维持“外交关系”，敌视中国人民，这是日本政府的立场，中国人民表示义正严词的态度，便是不“尊重”日本政府的立场；在修改日美“安全条约”名义下订立以侵略中、苏和亚洲国家为目的的美日军事同盟，是日本的“内政”，而作为日本近邻的中国，对于美帝国主义和日本潜在的帝国主义相互勾结，威胁中国和亚洲和平的阴谋，中国人民根据日本军国主义侵略中国六十年的痛苦的回忆而提高严重的警惕，便是“干涉”日本的内政。企图给潜在帝国主义的狰狞面目敷上胭脂水粉，蒙上一副骗人的画皮，这就是蓝皮书大谈其“尊重”与“不干涉”的真正目的。
    尽管蓝皮书企图为岸信介进行粉饰，但岸信介自己已无法再掩饰他的敌视中国的狰狞面目。最近岸信介访西欧之后，一再叫嚷他的“政治和经济分开”的荒谬主张，得到英国和西德某些政客的支持，敌视中国的态度更加嚣张。中国人民对于日本人民过去是、今后仍然是抱着友好和支持的态度，并一贯主张根据不同社会制度国家间和平共处的原则，同日本建立善邻友好、平等互利的关系，并为中日关系的正常化做许多努力。但是对于丧心病狂的岸信介之流坚持以帝国主义态度对待中国，中国人民是懂得“以其人之道，还治其人之身”的。	（四）
    综上所述，日本第三号外交蓝皮书系统地端出了岸信介政府进一步勾结美国，加速重整军备，敌视中苏，向亚非等地区进行扩张和侵略的潜在帝国主义外交纲领。依靠一个强大的帝国主义，实行远交近攻的毒计，来实现自己的侵略野心，曾经是明治维新以来日本帝国主义者的惯技。太平洋战争发动者之一、战犯岸信介今天所采取的外交“基本路线”，仍是想走这条老路。岸政府目前同美国谈判修改日美
  “安全条约”，进一步卖身投靠到美国的战争体系之中，按照美帝国主义“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋行事，企图驱使日本人民充当美国进攻亚洲人民的先锋和炮灰，从亚洲人民的流血惨剧中捞一把；有朝一日，日本军国主义分子便搭在美国的侵略战车上，对亚洲国家实行军事扩张，实现其恢复帝国主义的狂妄计划。岸信介这种狼子野心，不能不引起中国人民、日本人民和整个亚洲人民的严重警惕和坚决反对。
    岸信介政府把日本拖上帝国主义的前途是并不美妙的。从整个国际局势来看，今天是东风压倒西风的时代。社会主义在全世界的发展正如旭日东升，而帝国主义确已经日薄西山。如果说，二十年前，当社会主义只是在一个国家取得胜利，帝国主义还能够猖獗一时的时候，日本帝国主义独霸亚洲的迷梦都没有得逞；那么在今天，当社会主义阵营已经日趋强大团结巩固，并且取得了压倒帝国主义的优势的时候，日本军国主义分子休想重温帝国主义的旧梦。同时，亚非和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，风起云涌，不断高涨。亚洲有许多国家，曾经遭受日本帝国主义的侵犯，对日本军国主义的滔天罪行记忆犹新；今天他们正在为争取和卫护自己的民族独立而斗争，并且能够指望得到社会主义国家的友好合作，因此决不容许日本垄断集团勾结美国，以新的方式对他们进行扩张和侵略。如果日本军国主义分子执迷不悟，跟着美国走侵略战争的道路，其结果必然是碰得头破血流，落得个甘作陪葬的下场。只有采取和平中立的道路，放弃帝国主义的扩张侵略的野心，同亚非国家根据和平共处五项原则实行友好合作，才是日本唯一光明的出路。目前日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”，争取独立民主，和平中立和中日友好的运动，正如燎原之火，蓬勃发展，显示了日本人民争取和平，反对战争的不可动摇的决心。中国人民将竭尽全力，始终不渝的支持日本人民的这种正义斗争，并深信，日本人民必将团结一致，排除一切障碍和困难，获得最后胜利。
