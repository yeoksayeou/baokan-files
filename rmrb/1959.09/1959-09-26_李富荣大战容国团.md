By our reporters Zuo Ji and Xu Ben

In the National Games' men's singles table tennis competition, world champion Rong Guotuan encountered a tenacious opponent last night during the quarter-final match: Li Furong, a seventeen-year-old from Shanghai. This match attracted the entire audience. One was a renowned world champion, and the other was an up-and-coming player with sharp skills. People had already anticipated that the meeting of the two would be a thrilling and intense battle of courage and wits.

As the battle began, Li Furong launched a fierce offensive, frequently employing killer shots. However, the experienced Rong Guotuan remained calm and composed, responding steadily. After reaching eighteen all, Li Furong scored three consecutive points, taking the lead by winning the first game.

In the second game, Rong Guotuan used spin and non-spin serves and pushed highly spinning balls to suppress his opponent's attack, leading with a score of sixteen to nine. However, Li Furong did not back down, scoring five consecutive points with service attacks, closing the gap to fourteen to sixteen. At this point, Rong Guotuan employed a tactic combining forehand attacks and targeting the opponent's right corner, often scoring when Li Furong's attacks were unsuccessful. Finally, Rong Guotuan won back a game with a score of twenty-one to nineteen.

However, Li Furong, like a newborn calf, was courageous and tenacious. He showed no fear in the face of a strong opponent. He launched a series of service attacks, followed by a volley of sweeping shots from left to right, winning the third game with a score of twenty-one to eighteen.

The fourth game was crucial for both sides. During the break, the coach reminded Rong Guotuan to take the initiative and strengthen his attack. The audience also speculated that Rong Guotuan would utilize his multifaceted tactics at this critical juncture to win through strategy. However, with a two-to-one lead, Li Furong's offensive was fierce, and he became more and more courageous, taking an early lead of six to one. At this point, Rong Guotuan used various tactics such as service attacks, forehand attacks, blocking, pushing, and rallies, bringing the score back to six all. The battle became even more intense, with scores of seven all, eight all, nine all, all the way to seventeen all, twenty all, and twenty-two all. At this point, there were often exciting scenes of both sides retreating several feet from the table and engaging in multiple repeated rallies. Finally, Rong won with a score of twenty-four to twenty-two.

In the final game, Li Furong played both bravely and intelligently. When Rong Guotuan pushed highly spinning balls, he did not immediately smash them but instead rallied several times to transition before seizing the opportunity to deliver a killer shot and score. Li Furong maintained the upper hand throughout this game, ultimately winning with a score of twenty-one to sixteen.

After the match, everyone congratulated Li Furong. People celebrated not only Li's tenacity and exceptional technique but, more importantly, saw the growing new strength in China's table tennis team from this young player. (See attached photo)

    本报记者　作骥　徐奔
    全国运动会乒乓球男子单打，昨天晚上争夺前八名决战的时候，世界冠军容国团遇上了顽强的对手——上海十七岁的小将李富荣。这场比赛吸引着全场观众。一个是著名的世界冠军，一个是球技凌厉的闯将。人们早已预感到，两人相遇将是一场斗勇斗智精彩激烈的战斗。
    战幕拉开，李富荣即猛冲猛打，频施杀手，但经验丰富的容国团不慌不忙，沉着应战。打到十八平后李富荣一气取得三分，先声夺人，拿下头关。
    第二局，容国团利用转与不转的发球和搓出旋转性很强的球，压住对手的抢攻，以十六比九领先。但李富荣毫不退缩，发球抢攻连得五分，追成十四比十六。这时容国团施展了抽攻和突击对方右角空挡相结合的战术，每每在李富荣猛攻不下时，突袭得分。最后以二十一比十九，容国团夺回了一局。
    但是，李富荣好比初生的牛犊，勇猛顽强，在强手面前毫无惧色，只见他一阵发球抢攻，接着是像连珠炮式的左右横扫，以二十一比十八胜了第三局。
    第四局对双方都是关键性的一局。休息时，场外指导提醒容国团应采取主动，加强进攻。观众也猜测着容国团在这紧要关头将发挥他的多面战术的特长，以智取胜。可是，李富荣在二比一领先的优势下，攻势凌厉，越战越勇，开始便以六比一领先。这时容国团用了发球抢攻、抽攻、推挡、搓球和对攻等多种战术，追到六平。以后战斗越发激烈，七平、八平、九平，一直打到十七平、二十平、二十二平，这时候，常常出现双方离台数尺展开多次反复抽击的精采场面。最后容以二十四比二十二胜。
    最后一局，李富荣打得又勇猛又机智，当容国团搓来旋转性很强的球时，他不马上起板扣杀，而是先拉几板过渡，然后伺机突施杀手得分。这一局李富荣一直占上风，以二十一比十六获得最后胜利。
    比赛结束，大家纷纷向李富荣道贺，人们庆贺的不仅仅是李的顽强意志和卓越的技术，更重要的是，从这位年轻选手身上，看到了我国乒乓球队伍中的新生力量正在不断成长。（附图片）
