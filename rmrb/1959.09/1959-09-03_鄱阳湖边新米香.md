New Rice Fragrance by the Side of Poyang Lake
\tChen Dafan

\tHappy Harvest Under the Tower Ridge Mountain
\tMore than a week before "Beginning of Autumn," the early rice by the side of Poyang Lake was almost harvested. In the fields of Zhuhu People's Commune in Boyang County, only a few late-ripening japonica rice plants swayed in the summer breeze like drunkards; the rest of the paddy fields had been replaced with green clothing, and dry land had been planted with autumn crops. People were harvesting rice under the Tower Ridge Mountain. This was the final sprint by the Hualong Brigade. The fields were exceptionally lively, the rice ears striking the rice threshing baskets with resounding thuds. Dozens, hundreds of sickles flashed, and the young commune members sang mountain songs as they cut:

\tThe waves of Poyang Lake surge to the sky,
\tHappy harvest on the shores of Poyang Lake,
\tThe people's commune has great power,
\tOne season of early rice surpasses a year.

\tThis sloping field under the Tower Ridge Mountain used to be a "sky-water field" without any source of water. The only pond above was also controlled by the landlord Lin Xintang. For the sake of water, no one knows how many grudges were formed, how many fights broke out; lawsuits were filed all the way to Jiujiang, the lawsuits were fought for three years, and in the end, Lin Xintang won. Each household on the Hualong Village side had to pay more than two hundred thousand yuan in legal fees. Every family in the village sold their pigs to repay this unjust debt, but the fields were still "dry enough to kill toads and starve mud loaches." The sloping field under the Tower Ridge Mountain became a piece of land without irrigation. In addition to the long distance, the peasants could not take care of it, and the soil quality became worse year by year, with grass taller than rice. One mu only yielded a hundred or so catties of grain. After liberation, the situation changed somewhat, but the ownership of this sloping field was very dispersed, with a few mu belonging to this team and a few hills belonging to that village. Arguments often arose over water, so people called it the "Quarreling Slope."

\tThis year, the commune Party committee was determined to change the low-yield appearance of this sloping field, and transferred one hundred and twenty-one laborers from various teams to form a professional expedition team, led by Zhou Rongzong, a member of the Hualong Brigade Party General Branch, to set up camp in the field and launch a sudden and vigorous attack on these more than seven hundred mu of third-class land. In order to solve the water source, a new reservoir was built under the mountain, which could irrigate more than five hundred mu of land. In the past, in order to get a little water, each village and team sent people to guard it, wasting a lot of manpower. Now the commune members say: the palm and the back of the hand are all flesh, and the fields on the slope are all commune's land, and one person can release the water. When fertilizer was insufficient, grass skin and burnt soil ash were shoveled from the field ridges and embankments, and more than three hundred dan of base fertilizer were applied per mu. The expedition team also raised pigs in the camp to accumulate fertilizer. In this way, barren fields became fertile fields, distant fields became near fields, and waterless fields became water-filled fields. The commune members of the Hualong Brigade were overjoyed and rushed to tell each other: This year's early rice yield has increased by more than two times compared to last year. Even the fields under the Tower Ridge Mountain with the worst soil quality yielded 604 catties per mu. This is the first song of victory for this year's continued Great Leap Forward.

\t"Hopeless Ridge" Becomes "Thousand-Cattie Ridge"
\tIn the early morning, before the frogs in the pond had stopped singing, the members of the Putian Brigade set off to support the farm in harvesting rice. Xu Lingzhong, the secretary of the brigade Party branch, saw "San Mazi," an old commune member in his sixties, in the team, and asked:
\t"Old San, where are you going?"
\t"Harvesting rice!"
\t"Don't go out to harvest rice at your age. The team is rushing to plant these days. You are an experienced farmer, stay at home and give more guidance on sowing!"
\t"There are those young people at home, they can do it! They are energetic and have advanced ideas, much better than my old eyes!"
\tThe branch secretary smiled when he heard his answer. It turned out that the old man had an interesting argument with the young people:

\tThat was last winter when they were vigorously accumulating fertilizer to lay the foundation for harvesting a thousand catties of grain this year. As soon as the old man heard the word "thousand catties of grain," he shook his head repeatedly and said, "Young people, you are bold and dare to boast about this."

\tThe old man's idea was not without basis, because the fields in Qianhu Ridge were all cold clay fields, with only four inches of mud on the bottom, and yellow soil underneath. In addition to being far from the village and lacking fertilizer, they only yielded two to three hundred catties of grain each year. The best year only yielded five hundred catties. People were so upset that they changed the name of "Qianhu Ridge" to "Hopeless Ridge." In such a place, how could it be possible to yield a thousand catties of grain per mu?

\tThe young people did not think so. They believed that with the strong power of the people's commune, low-yield fields could be completely transformed. During the low-yield field transformation movement last winter, in addition to deep plowing the land, they also filled the fields with pond mud and lake mud, increasing the topsoil by about one and a half inches, and planted all green manure. After the spring plowing began, the League Branch Secretary Li Zuxi took the lead in organizing a field commando team to set up camp in the field, shovel all the turf from the edge of the field, and compost it in the field as base fertilizer. After transplanting the rice seedlings, they applied 220 catties of soil fertilizer, 20 catties of fertilizer powder, as well as dried cakes, pig and cattle manure, and rapeseed husks per mu. The crops did not disappoint the hard work. As a result, the seedlings grew lush and lovely. When the harvest became a certainty, the young people invited Li Sandie to watch the rice. He carefully looked and counted, and said with a smile:
\t"In the past, in the rice fields of Qianhu Ridge, the toads were so dried by the sun that they had no place to hide from the shade. This year's rice is so dense and thick that it is difficult to even see the water. It is no problem to harvest a thousand catties of grain. From now on, we can no longer call it 'Hopeless Ridge', but we should call it 'Thousand-Cattie Ridge'."

\tAfter the harvest, the eighty mu of land on this slope averaged 1,251 catties of rice per mu, and the old man was even more convinced. In the past, when the team had something to discuss with him, he always shook his head and said nothing, but now he is very active and goes to do everything. He says to everyone he meets: "The people's commune has great power, low-yield fields become high-yield fields. My old eyes don't work anymore. Today's young people not only have drive but also have vision. Truly, the new era produces new talents!"

\tHarvest Evening Party

\tIt got dark, the stars twinkled in the sky, and the male and female commune members of the Putian Brigade of the Zhuhu People's Commune, after eating dinner, came in twos and threes to a drying ground next to the commune office. The field was swept clean, and they sat around the straw stacks around the field, talking and laughing. Commune member Zhou Linsheng is the most active person in cultural and recreational activities, and his "Boyang Drum" is the most popular among commune members. Tonight, he beat the drum again and spoke the drum lyrics he had just composed:

\tBeat the drum, spread the good news,
\tMen, women, old and young, listen to me,
\tPutian Team of Zhuhu Commune,
\tEarly rice yields over a thousand catties per mu.

\tTalk about miracles, talk about good harvests,
\tA sixty-year-old man smiles:
\tI have been farming for decades,
\tI have never seen such a great harvest.
\tGreat harvest, joy after joy,
\tThe power of the commune is as great as the sky,
\tStrive for the autumn season to surpass the summer season,
\tHappy life is boundless.

\tWho is not happy during the harvest season! Old commune member Li Rongmao, eighty-one years old, also came with a cane in the dark to participate in this harvest evening party. He said, "This year can truly be said to be blessed by heaven. The people's commune has brought a great harvest, which I have never seen in all the dynasties I have lived through!"

\tIn these days of harvest, songs and laughter can be heard everywhere. It's late at night, the loud singing and happy laughter still reverberate in the threshing ground. It is truly:

\tNew rice fragrance by the side of Poyang Lake,
\tHappy and joyful during the harvest season,
\tEarly rice yields over a thousand catties per mu,
\tEveryone thanks the Communist Party.

    鄱阳湖边新米香
    陈达凡
    塔岭山下喜丰收
    “立秋”前一个多星期，鄱阳湖畔的早稻就收割得差不多了。波阳县珠湖人民公社的田野上，只间或有几丘收割期较晚的粳稻像醉汉似的在夏风中摇荡着；其余的水田都换上了绿装，旱地都种上了秋熟作物。塔岭山下正在割禾。这是华龙大队在作最后的突击。田野上热闹异常，稻穗打在禾戽上咚咚作响，几十把、几百把镰刀挥动着，青年社员们边割还边唱着山歌：
    鄱阳湖水浪滔天，
    鄱阳湖畔庆丰年，
    人民公社力量大，
    早稻一季赛一年。
    塔岭山下这坂田过去是没有水源的“天水田”。上边仅有的一口塘也给地主林信堂控制着。为了水的事，不知结了多少怨，打了多少架；告状告到九江去，官司打了三年，结果还是林信堂赢了。华龙村这边每户要出二十多万元的官司钱，村子里家家都把猪卖光了，去还这笔冤枉债，田里还是“干死蛤蟆饿死泥鳅”。塔岭山下成了一片没有灌溉的田地，加上路远，农民顾不得管，土质一年不如一年，草比禾高，一亩只打百把来斤谷。解放后，面貌有些改变，但是这坂田的主权很分散，这个队有几亩，那个村有几丘，为了水的事也常发生口角，所以人们都管它叫“吵嘴坂”。
    今年，公社党委决心要改变这坂田的低产面貌，从各队抽调了一百二十一个劳力组成一支远征专业队，由华龙大队党总支委员周荣宗带领，到田头扎寨，突击猛攻这七百多亩三类田。为了解决水源，在山下新建了一个水库，足可以灌溉五百多亩田。过去为了点水，各村各队都派人去看守，不知费了多少人力，现在社员们说：手掌手背皆是肉，坂上坂下都是公社的田，一个人放水就行了。肥料不足就在田塍地墈铲草皮、烧火土灰，每亩下了三百多担底肥。远征队还在营寨里养猪积肥。这样，瘦田就变成了肥田，远田变成了近田，无水田变成了饱水田。华龙大队的社员们喜笑颜开的奔走相告：今年早稻比去年增产了两倍多。连土质最差的塔岭山下的田也亩产六百零四斤。这是今年继续大跃进声中的第一曲丰收的凯歌。
    绝户垅变“千斤垅”
    清晨，池塘里的青蛙还没有停止它的歌唱，铺田大队的队员们就出发去支援农场割禾，大队党支部书记徐灵钟看见六十多岁的老社员“三麻子”也在队伍里，便问：
    “老三爹，你到那里去呀？”
    “割禾呀！”
    “你这么大年纪的人不要出去割禾了，队里这几天正在抢种，你是有经验的庄稼汉，留在家里多指导一下播种吧！”
    “家里有那帮青年人，能行呀！他们的劲头大，思想先进，比我这老眼光强多了！”
    支部书记听了他这个回答，抿着嘴笑了起来，原来这老头和青年人有一段有趣的争论：
    那是去年冬天大搞积肥，为争取今年收千斤粮打基础的时候。老头一听见千斤粮这个词，连连摇手说：“青年人，胆子大，敢夸这个口。”
    老头这个想法并不是没有根据的，因为千户垅这地方的田都是冷浆田，泥底只四寸深，底下全是黄壤，加上离村子远，肥料缺乏，每年只打两三百斤谷，最好的年成也只打过五百斤。人们气不过，就把“千户垅”这个地名改叫“绝户垅”。在这样的地方，每亩田打千斤谷怎么可能呢？
    青年人却不这么想，他们相信凭着人民公社的强大力量，低产田是完全可以被改造的。去年冬天改造低产田运动中，他们除了深翻土地以外，还在田面上填上塘泥和湖泥，加厚表土一寸半左右，并且全部种上了绿肥。春耕开始以后，团支书李祖希带头组织一个野战突击队，到田间安营扎寨，把田边的草皮都铲下来，沤在田里做底肥，插秧以后每亩又追上土化肥二百二十斤，肥田粉二十斤，还有枯饼、猪牛粪和油菜籽壳。庄稼不负苦心人，结果禾苗长的青葱可爱，到丰收成了定局时，青年们请李三爹去看禾，他仔细瞧着数着，笑眯眯的说：
  “过去千户垅里的禾田里，蛤蟆都被太阳晒得没有躲阴的地方，今年的禾又密又厚，连水都难得看见，打一千斤谷是不成问题的，从今以后我们不能再叫它‘绝户垅’了，要叫它‘千斤垅’。”
    收割以后，这坂上八十多亩田平均亩产稻子一千二百五十一斤，老汉更是口服心服了。以往队里有事找他商量，他老是摇摇头，不吭声，现在可积极了，干什么都去。他逢人就说：“人民公社力量大，低产田变高产田，我的老眼光不行了，现在的青年人不仅有干劲，而且有见识，真是新时代出新人材呀！”
    丰收晚会
    天黑下来了，星星闪灼在天空，珠湖人民公社铺田大队的男女社员们，吃完晚饭，三三两两的来到了公社办公室旁边的一个晒场上，场子打扫得干干净净，他们就在场子周围的稻草堆下围坐下来，说说笑笑。社员周林生是文娱活动方面最活跃的人物，他说的“波阳大鼓”，最受社员欢迎。今天晚上。他又敲起鼓板，说起他刚刚编好的鼓词：
    打鼓板，喜讯传，
    男女老少听我言，
    珠湖公社铺田队，
    早稻亩产超一千。
    说奇迹，道丰年，
    六十岁的老人笑开言：
    种田种了几十载，
    从没见过这样的大丰年，
    大丰年，喜连连，
    公社力量大如天，
    力争秋季超夏季，
    幸福生活乐无边。
    丰收时节谁不乐呀！八十一岁的老社员李荣茂也拄着拐棍，摸黑来参加这丰收晚会。他说，“今年真可说是洪福齐天，人民公社带来了大丰收，我活了几个朝代都没见过的呀！”
    在这丰收的日子里随处都可以听到歌声和笑声，夜深了，嘹亮的歌声，欢乐的笑声还回旋在打谷场上。正是：
    鄱阳湖边新米香，
    丰收时节喜洋洋，
    早稻亩亩超千斤，
    人人感谢共党产。
