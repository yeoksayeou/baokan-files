To construct at high speed
Minister of Construction, Liu Xiufeng
In the past ten years, a total of over 520 million square meters of factories, residences, and public buildings have been completed nationwide, which is larger than ten Shanghais.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our great motherland has traversed a glorious decade on the road of socialism with heroic spirit and bold strides.

In these ten years, the vast number of employees in China's construction industry have used their own hands to build thousands of modern factories, countless magnificent buildings, and many new industrial cities and industrial zones on the vast land of the motherland. In the past ten years, a total of over 520 million square meters of factories, residences, and public buildings have been completed nationwide, equivalent to 25 times the building area of Beijing before liberation, and larger than ten Shanghais. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual construction area was more than 53 million square meters; since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the annual construction area has reached more than 100 million square meters. The scale of construction is getting larger and larger, and the speed is getting faster and faster.

In terms of industrial construction, more than 10,000 industrial and mining enterprises were under construction during the First Five-Year Plan period, including more than 900 large-scale enterprises above the quota. In 1958, due to the nationwide mass campaign to run industries, large, medium, and small-sized industrial and mining enterprises sprung up like mushrooms, and more than 1,000 large-scale enterprises were newly started or continued construction. Among them, more than 700 large-scale enterprises above the quota have been completed and partially put into production. Among the completed enterprises, many are modern enterprises that China has never had before. Such as high-grade alloy steel smelting enterprises, non-ferrous metal smelting enterprises, chemical industry enterprises, precision instrument manufacturing enterprises, manufacturing enterprises for airplanes, automobiles, tractors, metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, power generation equipment, etc. The completion of these enterprises has laid a preliminary foundation for China's industrialization and created favorable conditions for the continuous leap forward of industry and agriculture.

In terms of civil buildings, a total of more than 350 million square meters of residences and various public buildings have been completed in ten years. Among them, the state-funded construction of residences reached more than 163 million square meters, and if a large number of residences built by enterprises and through "self-construction and public assistance" are added, it will greatly exceed this number. This not only guarantees the urgent needs of workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises, but also enables millions of working people to get rid of the poor living conditions left over from old China. For example, more than 4 million square meters of new workers' residences have been built in Shanghai since liberation, allowing 600,000 workers to move from dark, damp, and crowded shantytowns into spacious, clean, comfortable, and convenient new homes. In the past ten years, the construction area of new large, medium, and small schools has reached 44 million square meters, an increase of three times compared with the total school area before liberation. More than 2,500 new theaters and cinemas have been built, an increase of 1.7 times compared with before liberation. More than 1,300 new hospitals have been built, and the number of beds has increased five times compared with before liberation. In addition, a large number of shops, cultural palaces, libraries, exhibition halls, gymnasiums, kindergartens, etc. have also been built. With the development of people's communes and agricultural production, the vast rural areas have also begun to plan and construct residential areas in a planned way. A new type of rural area is about to appear. All these powerfully illustrate the infinite care of the Party and the government for the vast working people, and illustrate that the material and cultural living standards of the vast people are constantly improving.

Due to the large-scale construction of industrial and civil buildings, the face of our cities has greatly changed. The urban population has increased from more than 40 million in the early days of liberation to about 100 million.

Due to the large-scale construction of industrial and civil buildings, the face of our cities has greatly changed. The urban population has increased from more than 40 million in the early days of liberation to about 100 million. In the past ten years, construction work has been carried out in more than 2,100 towns and industrial areas, including 167 newly built and 124 large-scale rebuilt and expanded. Not only have the original consumer cities been transformed into production cities, but also many new cities have appeared in remote areas. Such as Hailar and Yakeshi in the northeast forest area, and Karamay in the northwest Gobi desert. Baotou, the steel capital on the Inner Mongolia plateau, had a population of less than 100,000 in the past, but today it has become a new industrial city with a population of 500,000 to 600,000. Lanzhou, a major town in the northwest, had only some small shops and handicraft workshops for more than 1,300 years, but now it has become a large-scale industrial base with factories and clean streets. In the capital Beijing, from the reconstruction during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty to the 500 years before liberation, the total construction area was only more than 20 million square meters; after liberation, the newly built industrial and civil buildings have reached 27 million square meters, exceeding 500 years in ten years. In many other industrial cities such as Xi'an, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Datong, Zhuzhou, Hefei, Nanning, Guiyang, Hohhot, and Urumqi, the new construction area has exceeded the original by one, two, or even more than ten times. In the newly built and rebuilt cities, the water supply capacity has doubled compared with before liberation, and the number of public transportation vehicles has increased fivefold. Nearly 10,000 kilometers of new roads have been built, fundamentally changing the old city's situation of "three feet of dust without wind, and a street of mud with rain." At the same time, afforestation, park construction, drainage system dredging, etc. have been carried out, making our cities cleaner and more beautiful.

In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic and selfless assistance of experts from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the vast number of employees in China's construction industry have carried forward the spirit of learning while doing and hard work, rapidly improved their technical level, and accumulated rich experience. Through the great rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the various tasks of the construction industry have been comprehensively pushed to a new stage. This year, not only were more tasks completed than in any previous year, but also many new experiences were created, and a road that conforms to China's specific conditions and can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results was found. That is, under the strong leadership of the Party, implement political command, vigorously promote mass movements, vigorously promote rapid construction, vigorously promote technological revolution, vigorously promote diversified operations, and vigorously promote communist cooperation.

Vigorously promoting rapid construction is a major initiative of China's construction industry, a concentrated expression of the Party's general line in the construction industry.

Vigorously promoting rapid construction is a major initiative of China's construction industry, a culmination of ten years of construction experience, a major sign on the road of development of the construction industry, and a concentrated expression of the Party's general line in the construction industry. Its main contents are: 1. Implement political command, liberate thinking, oppose right-leaning conservatism, and vigorously promote mass movements; 2. Implement engineering queueing, shorten the battle line, concentrate manpower and material resources, and organize battles in batches and phases, fighting annihilation battles instead of attrition battles; 3. Carry out meticulous planning and strict organization work, so as to achieve fast design, fast preparation, fast construction, fast installation, and fast completion; 4. Improve the prefabrication and assembly degree of building components, and implement the combination of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and improved tools; 5. Implement three-dimensional cross-parallel flow operation, with the main project as the leading factor, so that all types of work can advance simultaneously, reducing and eliminating idle time; 6. Improve labor organization, implement mixed work teams, and develop versatile workers; 7. Leading cadres go deep into the front line, take command, and solve problems on the spot; 8. Implement unified leadership of the construction site, do a good job in the cooperation between Party A and Party B, general contractors and subcontractors, creating conditions for each other and promoting each other.

Obviously, implementing this construction method can greatly mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees, form a vigorous mass movement, and promote the comprehensive leap forward of various tasks in the construction industry. It can not only greatly accelerate the construction speed, shorten the construction period of a large factory by one-third, and shorten the construction period of a large workshop by one-half, but also comprehensively achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. The results of more than 8,000 projects implementing rapid construction last year fully proved this point. It can be imagined how significant the economic and political significance of universally implementing rapid construction is for accelerating China's socialist construction.

As everyone knows, Changchun Automobile Factory was built in two and a half years, which was considered a very fast speed at the time and was once praised as the world's advanced level; but now it only takes one and a half years to build a factory of this scale. A batch of projects recently completed in the capital is a new example of rapid construction. Among these projects are the Great Hall of the People, the Museum of Revolution and History, the Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Beijing Railway Station, the Workers' Stadium, the Agricultural Exhibition Hall, and the National Culture Palace, with a total construction area of more than 700,000 square meters. These buildings are not only complex in structure, but also have strict functional requirements, high artistic standards, and many decoration projects. They require advanced acoustic, optical, and thermal technology, require good handling of heating and ventilation, as well as fine painting and sculpture. Many of them are currently "cutting-edge" in construction technology. Taking the Great Hall of the People as an example, the construction area is more than 170,000 square meters, which is more than the total effective construction area of the Forbidden City. Among them, there are a 10,000-person auditorium, a 5,000-person banquet hall, and the office building of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. This building has steel beams weighing more than 141 tons and more than 60 meters long, more than 170,000 square meters of marble, granite, and terrazzo, 23,000 square meters of glazed tiles, 26 kilometers of ventilation pipes, 659 kilometers of electric wires, 30 kilometers of power cables, and more than 16,500 lighting fixtures, as well as complex gas, heating, broadcasting, simultaneous interpretation, television, and other equipment, and requires automatic adjustment of air to maintain constant temperature and humidity. These huge projects started one after another after October last year, and were all completed by the end of August this year under the conditions of designing, preparing, and constructing simultaneously. The construction time only took ten months, which is truly a miracle in the history of Chinese construction.

Since the beginning of this year, rapid construction has made new progress, and rich experience has been gained in organizing rapid construction of large-scale industrial buildings and tall civil buildings. Now, in some places, the projects implementing rapid construction have reached more than 80% of all projects.

Those who doubt rapid construction say that we "only focus on speed and lose quality" and that it is a "human sea tactics, which is a great waste." This is a completely untrue lie. Can rapid construction guarantee project quality? Facts are the most powerful proof. According to statistics from 23 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and three engineering bureaus directly under the Ministry of Construction, among the 5,073 rapid construction projects that have been completed and accepted, 5,051 were rated as excellent in quality and met the design requirements, accounting for 99.56%. The key to ensuring project quality lies in attaching importance to ideology, using correct methods, making sufficient preparations, and taking thorough measures. As long as we follow the correct set of methods for rapid construction, project quality can be fully guaranteed.

Will rapid construction cause waste? Not to mention the huge economic value generated by accelerating the construction speed, shortening the construction period, and putting a factory into production ahead of schedule, just in terms of rapid construction itself, due to the acceleration of speed, the improvement of labor productivity, the rational use of machinery and equipment, the wage fund, machinery costs, turnover materials, management fees, and temporary facility costs can be greatly saved, greatly reducing project costs. In the past few years, construction departments have reduced costs by an average of about 7% each year. Last year, due to the implementation of rapid construction, project costs were generally reduced by about 20%. Can this be said to be "a great waste"?

Is it a "human sea tactics"? Rapid construction requires shortening the battle line and appropriately concentrating manpower. However, it is an orderly construction carried out under unified planning and strict organization, which reflects not only the advancement of technology but also the strictness of the organization, and is by no means an unorganized crowd blindly rushing to work. Therefore, with the same manpower, the speed can be greatly accelerated and labor productivity can be improved. Anyone with a little construction knowledge knows that the construction site is limited. If the construction site is turned into a sea of people, it will inevitably hinder each other, and it will not only not be faster but slower. In 1958, the labor productivity of enterprises affiliated to the Ministry of Construction increased by 18% compared with 1957. If it is "human sea tactics," why can labor productivity still be improved? China has a large population. Under the conditions of a relatively weak industrial base and insufficient machinery and equipment, fully utilizing the favorable conditions of having a large labor force and giving full play to the role of people is a characteristic of the high-speed leap forward of China's construction industry. For projects with very urgent task requirements, appropriately adding more people, although it may seem a bit wasteful, is the greatest benefit because it wins time and puts the factory into production ahead of schedule.

Vigorously carrying out the technological revolution movement and implementing the policy of walking on two legs have enabled us to find a way to accelerate the realization of construction industrialization in China.

Vigorously carrying out the technological revolution and technical innovation movement to accelerate the realization of construction industrialization is an important experience gained by the construction industry since the Great Leap Forward. Implementing mechanized and industrialized construction is the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and also the direction of development of China's construction industry. However, how to gradually realize it according to China's specific conditions has been a question explored over the years. After the Party Central Committee put forward the call to carry out the technological revolution movement last year, a vigorous mass movement to vigorously carry out the technological revolution and technical innovation was launched in construction enterprises across the country. In just over a month, they basically put down the carrying poles and eliminated the phenomenon of shoulder carrying on construction sites across the country, realizing the motorization of horizontal transportation and the mechanization and semi-mechanization of vertical transportation. Then, a climax of reforming tools and creating new machines was launched. By the end of last year, more than 700 new tools and new machines used by almost all types of work had been improved and created. Through this movement, implementing the policy of walking on two legs has enabled us to find a way to accelerate the realization of construction industrialization in China. That is: the combination of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and improved tools, gradually improving the level of mechanization; the combination of industrialization, semi-industrialization, on-site prefabrication, and on-site pouring, gradually improving the degree of prefabrication and assembly. That is to say, it is necessary to combine the strength of the state, the strength of enterprises, and the strength of the masses, adapt to local conditions, adapt to engineering conditions, combine foreign and local methods, and proceed from low to high, so that China's construction industry can rapidly advance along the road of industrialization. According to this policy, we have carried out the selection, finalization, matching, and promotion of new tools and new machines created by the masses, thereby greatly reducing heavy labor and improving labor productivity. According to surveys in Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, and other places, 75% of the workers originally engaged in heavy labor have been freed from heavy labor. Some people cannot see these basic facts, deliberately find fault with new things, seize those temporary and partial shortcomings, and exaggerate them, saying that technological innovation is "formalism, flashy but not practical." They describe certain recurrence phenomena that occurred after putting down the carrying poles as a common and large number of facts; they describe things that are being researched and tested and have not yet had time to be promoted as "only seeing gifts but not products." We cannot imagine that the new tools and new machines created by the masses are perfect and can be immediately promoted nationwide once they are invented. Any new technology has a process of creation, trial production, improvement, and universal promotion, and the results of vigorously carrying out the technological revolution and technical innovation must also be viewed in this way.

Vigorously engaging in diversified operations, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the construction industry, relying on our own efforts, overcoming difficulties, and striving to complete construction tasks more, faster, better, and more economically is another important experience gained by the construction industry since the Great Leap Forward. According to statistics from construction enterprises affiliated to the Ministry of Construction, more than 2,900 factories were established last year, manufacturing more than 20,000 various construction machines, producing 140,000 tons of cement, more than 7,000 tons of steel, more than 20,000 tons of iron, and more than 500 million bricks. This has played a great role in improving the level of mechanization and overcoming the difficulties of insufficient materials. Many construction units completed 100% of the construction tasks last year using only 70% to 80% of the materials allocated by the state. This is a great achievement. However, some people disregard these facts and say that vigorously engaging in diversified operations is "not doing the right thing and outweighs the gains." Is it not doing the right thing? According to surveys, more than 80% of the diversified operations engaged in by construction enterprises in various places directly serve the construction, and about 15% indirectly serve the construction. Only a few products are sold externally. How can this be said to be not doing the right thing? Even growing vegetables and raising pigs can improve the lives of employees, so what's wrong with that? As for the question of whether the gains outweigh the losses, according to statistics from the four engineering bureaus of the Ministry of Construction, diversified operations made a profit of 3 million yuan in 1958. According to statistics from eleven provinces and cities and four engineering bureaus, the profit in the first half of this year was 28 million yuan. The cost of most diversified operation products is lower than the market price. Moreover, for diversified operations, we cannot only calculate small accounts and not large accounts. Under the conditions of insufficient supply of construction materials and very poor mechanical equipment conditions, we adopt the method of self-reliance, self-produce some materials, self-make some machines, arm ourselves, enhance initiative, and complete more construction tasks. Isn't this a great benefit to national construction? What is there to outweigh the gains? We should not only not deny diversified operations, but also advocate comprehensive operations and do a better job of comprehensive operations.

Vigorously promoting communist cooperation, mobilizing the positive factors of all aspects, supporting each other, and making a leap forward together is also an important experience gained since the Great Leap Forward. The cooperative relationship of the construction industry is quite complex. Externally, there are cooperative relationships with construction units, design units, material supply, transportation, municipal construction, and other aspects. Internally, there are cooperative relationships between general contractors and subcontractors, between various types of work and processes, between functional departments and construction sites, and between processing enterprises and civil construction and installation units. Only by mobilizing all forces from all aspects and uniting them into a rope can we ensure the completion of construction tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, due to the further implementation of political command, the strengthening of Party leadership, the establishment of a unified command organization for construction sites, and the adherence to the principle of local subordination to the whole, economic subordination to politics, and small accounts subordination to large accounts, relations have been greatly improved, the atmosphere of cooperation has been greatly enhanced, and the construction speed has been greatly promoted.

Vigorously promoting mass movements is the fundamental method for realizing the general line. Since last year, we have used the method of vigorously promoting mass movements to vigorously promote rapid construction, vigorously promote technological revolution, vigorously promote diversified operations, and vigorously promote communist cooperation. However, some people with right-leaning ideas say that our vigorous promotion of mass movements "has disrupted enterprises and destroyed normal production order." This is obviously very wrong.

China's construction industry has made brilliant achievements and accumulated rich experience in the past ten years, and the road we have taken is also correct. However, the tasks before us will be more arduous and glorious. In the future, on the road of continuing the Great Leap Forward, we will still encounter many difficulties. We are determined to guard against arrogance and impetuosity. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will hold high the red flag of the general line, resolutely oppose right-leaning ideas, muster greater energy, and bravely advance to realize the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year and to accelerate China's socialist construction.

    高速度地进行建设
    建筑工程部部长　刘秀峰
    十年来，全国建成的工厂住宅和公共建筑共达五亿二千多万平方米，比现在的十个上海还要大
    我们伟大的祖国，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，以英雄的气概，豪迈的步伐，在社会主义的大道上，已经走过了光辉的十年。
    在这十年中，我国建筑业广大职工群众，用自己的双手，在祖国辽阔的大地上，建设了成千上万的现代化工厂，建设了无数雄伟的高楼大厦，建设了许多新的工业城市和工业区。十年来，全国建成的工厂、住宅和公共建筑共达五亿二千多万平方米，相当于解放前二十五个北京的建筑面积，比现在的十个上海还大。第一个五年计划期间每年建成的建筑面积平均为五千三百多万平方米；从1958年大跃进以来，每年建成的建筑面积达到一亿平方米以上。建筑规模越来越大，速度也越来越快。
    在工业建筑方面，第一个五年计划期间进行建设的工矿企业有一万多个，其中限额以上的大型企业有九百多个。1958年由于全民大办工业，大、中、小型工矿企业犹如雨后春笋，遍地开花，仅新开工的和继续施工的大型企业即达一千多个。其中建成和部分建成投入生产的限额以上的大型企业有七百多个。在已经建成的企业中，有许多是我国从来没有的现代化企业。如高级合金钢冶炼企业，有色金属冶炼企业，化学工业企业，精密仪器制造企业，飞机、汽车、拖拉机以及冶金设备、采矿设备、发电设备的制造企业等等。这些企业的建成，打下了我国工业化的初步基础，为工农业的不断跃进创造了有利条件。
    在民用建筑方面，十年内建成的住宅和各种公用建筑共达三亿五千多万平方米。其中由国家拨款兴建的住宅达一亿六千三百多万平方米，如果加上由企业投资和“自建公助”修建的大量住宅，还要大大超过这个数目。这就不仅保证了工矿企业职工的迫切需要，而且使千百万劳动人民摆脱了旧中国遗留下来的恶劣的居住条件。如上海解放后新建的工人住宅就有四百多万平方米，使六十万职工从阴暗潮湿、拥挤不堪的棚户区，搬进了宽敞整洁、舒适方便的新居。十年来新建的大中小学校建筑面积达四千四百万平方米，比解放前的学校面积总和增长了三倍。新建的剧院、电影院有二千五百多个，比解放前增加了一点七倍。新建的医院达一千三百多所，病床比解放前增加五倍。此外还建筑了大量的商店、文化宫、图书馆、展览馆、体育馆、幼儿园等等。随着人民公社和农业生产的发展，广大农村也已经开始有计划地进行居民点的规划和建设。新型的农村即将出现。所有这些都有力地说明党和政府对广大劳动人民的无限关怀，说明广大人民的物质文化生活水平正在不断提高。
    由于工业建筑和民用建筑的大量兴建，使我国城市面貌大大改观。城市人口已由解放初期的四千多万增加到一亿左右
    由于工业建筑与民用建筑的大量兴建，使我国城市的面貌大大改观。城市人口已由解放初期的四千多万增加到一亿左右。十年来在两千一百多个城镇和工业区中进行了建设工作，其中新建的有一百六十七个，大规模改建扩建的有一百二十四个。不仅原来的消费城市已经改造成为生产城市，而且在边远地区出现了许多新城市。如东北林区的海拉尔和牙克石，西北戈壁滩上的克拉玛依等。内蒙古高原上的钢都——包头，过去不到十万人口，今天已经成为一个拥有五六十万人口的新型工业城市。西北重镇的兰州，一千三百多年来只有一些小商店和手工作坊，现在已经变成规模宏大、工厂林立、街道整洁的工业基地。首都北京，自明代永乐年间改建时起，到解放前的五百多年间，共有建筑面积不过两千零几十万平方米；解放后，新建的工业与民用建筑已有二千七百万平方米，十年超过了五百年。其他如西安、洛阳、郑州、太原、大同、株洲、合肥、南宁、贵阳、呼和浩特、乌鲁木齐等许多工业城市，新的建筑面积已经超过原有的一倍、两倍甚至十倍以上。在新建和改建的城市中，供水能力比解放前增加了一倍，公共交通车辆增加了五倍。新建了近一万公里的马路，根本改变了旧城市“无风三尺土、有雨一街泥”的状况。同时进行了植树造林，修建公园，疏导排水系统等等，使得我们的城市更加整洁美丽。
    十年来，我国建筑业广大职工群众在党的领导下，在苏联和其他社会主义国家的专家热诚无私的帮助下，发扬了边学边干，艰苦奋斗的精神，迅速地提高了技术水平，积累了丰富的经验。经过伟大的整风运动和1958年的大跃进，把建筑业的各项工作，又全面地推到了一个新的阶段。这一年不仅完成了比过去任何一年都多得多的任务，而且创造了许多新的经验，摸到了一条符合我国具体情况的、能够实现多快好省的道路。这就是，在党的坚强领导下，实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大搞快速施工，大搞技术革命，大搞多种经营，大搞共产主义协作的道路。
    大搞快速施工是我国建筑业的一个重大创举，是建筑业贯彻党的总路线的集中表现
    大搞快速施工是我国建筑业的一个重大创举，是十年来施工经验的集大成，是建筑业发展道路上的一个主要标志，是建筑业贯彻党的总路线的集中表现。它的主要内容就是：一、实行政治挂帅，解放思想，反对右倾保守，大搞群众运动；二、实行工程排队，缩短战线，集中人力物力，分批分期组织战役，打歼灭战不打消耗战；三、进行周密的计划和严密的组织工作，作到快设计，快准备，快施工，快安装，快结尾；四、提高建筑物构件的预制装配程度，实行机械化、半机械化和改良工具相结合的施工；五、实行立体交叉平行流水作业，以主体工程为主导，使各工种齐头并进，减少和消灭间歇时间；六、改善劳动组织，实行混合工作队，发展多面手；七、领导干部深入现场，坐镇指挥，发现问题，就地解决；八、实行施工现场的统一领导，搞好甲方乙方、总包分包之间的协作，互相创造条件，互相促进。
    很明显，实行这种施工方法，就可以大大调动广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就可以促进建筑业各项工作的全面跃进，不仅可以大大加快施工速度，使建设一个大型工厂的工期缩短三分之一，建设一个大型车间的工期缩短二分之一，而且可以全面达到多快好省。去年八千多项工程实行快速施工的结果，充分地证明了这一点。可以设想，普遍实行快速施工，对于加速我国的社会主义建设，具有多么重大的经济意义和政治意义。
    大家知道，长春汽车厂是用两年半时间建成的，这在当时算是很快的速度，曾经被誉为世界先进水平；而现在建设这样规模的工厂，只要一年半就可以建成。最近在首都建成的一批工程，是快速施工的一个新的范例。在这批工程中，有人民大会堂，革命、历史博物馆，革命军事博物馆，北京火车站，工人体育场，农业展览馆，民族文化宫等，建筑面积共七十多万平方米。这些建筑物不仅结构复杂，而且功能要求很严，艺术标准很高，装饰工程很多，要求高级的声、光、热学技术，要求很好地处理取暖通风以及精细的彩绘和雕塑，其中很多都是目前建筑技术上的“尖端”。拿人民大会堂来说，建筑面积十七万多平方米，比故宫的全部有效建筑面积还多。其中有万人礼堂、五千人宴会厅、人大常委的办公楼等。这个建筑物有重达一百四十一吨、长达六十多米的钢梁，有十七万多平方米的大理石、花岗石、水磨石，二万三千多平方米的琉璃瓦，二十六公里长的通风管道，六百五十九公里长的电线，三十公里长的动力电缆，一万六千五百多个灯具，还有复杂的煤气、热力、广播、译意风、电视等设备，并且要求自动调节空气，保持恒温恒湿。这些巨大的工程，从去年10月以后陆续开工，在边设计、边准备、边施工的条件下，到今年8月底都已全部建成，建设时间只用了十个月，这真是我国建筑史上的一个奇迹。
    今年以来，快速施工又有新的发展，在组织大面积的、大型工业建筑和高大民用建筑的快速施工方面，都取得了丰富的经验。现在有些地方实行快速施工的工程已达全部工程的80％以上。
    怀疑快速施工的人，说我们“只抓速度，丢了质量”，是“人海战术，浪费很大”。这是完全不符合事实的谎言。快速施工能不能保证工程质量呢？事实是最有力的证明。根据去年二十三个省、市、自治区和建筑工程部直属的三个工程局的统计，在已经交工验收的五千零七十三项快速施工的工程中，质量评为优良和符合设计要求的有五千零五十一项，占99.56％。保证工程质量的关键，在于思想重视，方法对头，准备充足，措施周到，只要按照快速施工的一套正确办法去作，工程质量是完全可以保证的。
    快速施工会不会造成浪费呢？且不说施工速度加快，工期缩短，使一个工厂提前投入生产所产生的巨大的经济价值，仅就快速施工本身来说，由于速度加快，劳动生产率提高，机械设备得到合理使用，工资基金、机械费用、周转材料、管理费用和临时设施费用都可以大大节省，使工程成本大为降低。过去几年，施工部门每年降低成本平均在7％左右，去年由于实行快速施工，工程成本一般降低了20％左右，这能说是“浪费很大”吗？
    是不是“人海战术”呢？快速施工是需要缩短战线，适当集中人力的。但它是在统一计划和严密组织之下进行有秩序的施工，既体现技术的先进性，又体现组织的严密性，决不是乌合之众，盲目抢工。因而用同样的人力，就可以大大的加快速度，提高劳动生产率。稍有施工常识的人都知道，施工场地是有限的，如果把工地变成人山人海，必然互相妨碍，不仅不快反而更慢。1958年建筑工程部系统所属企业的劳动生产率就比1957年提高了18％。如果是“人海战术”，劳动生产率为什么还能提高呢？我国人口众多，在工业基础比较薄弱，机械设备不足的情况下，充分运用劳动力多的有利条件，充分发挥人的作用，正是我国建设事业能够高速度跃进的一个特征。对于任务要求很急的工程，适当地多上一些人，虽然看来有些浪费，但是赢得了时间，使工厂提前投入生产，就是最大的利益。
    大力开展技术革命运动，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，使我们找到了在我国加速实现建筑工业化的道路
    大搞技术革命和技术革新运动，以加速实现建筑工业化，是大跃进以来建筑业取得的一个重要经验。实行机械化、工厂化施工，是苏联的先进经验，也是我国建筑业的发展方向。但是如何根据我国具体情况逐步实现，则是几年来一直在摸索的问题。去年党中央提出开展技术革命运动的号召以后，全国建筑企业掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的大搞技术革命和技术革新的群众运动，在短短的一个多月内，就在全国建筑工地上基本上放下了扁担，消灭了肩挑人抬的现象，实现了水平运输车子化，垂直运输机械化、半机械化。接着又开展了一个改革工具和创造新机械的高潮，到去年底，已经改良和创造了几乎包括所有工种使用的七百多种新工具和新机械。通过这个运动，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，使我们找到了在我国加速实现建筑工业化的道路。这就是：机械化、半机械化和改良工具相结合，逐步提高机械化水平；工厂化、半工厂化、现场预制和现场浇灌相结合，逐步提高预制装配程度的方针。这就是说，要把国家的力量、企业的力量和群众的力量结合起来，因地制宜，因工程制宜，洋土结合，由低到高，使我国建筑业沿着工业化的道路迅速前进。根据这个方针，我们对于群众创造的新工具和新机械，进行选型、定型、配套、推广工作，从而大大减少了笨重劳动，提高了劳动生产率。据北京、天津、辽宁等地调查，原来从事笨重劳动的工人，已有75％摆脱了笨重劳动。有些人看不见这些基本的事实，故意对新生事物责备求全，抓住那些暂时的局部的缺点，加以扩大，说什么技术革新是“形式主义，华而不实”。把放扁担以后一度发生的某些回生现象，说成是普遍的大量的事实；把正在研究试验还没有来得及推广的东西说成是“只见礼品不见产品”。我们不能设想，群众创造的新工具和新机械都完美无缺，一经发明就能立即在全国推广。任何新技术都有一个创造、试制、改进和普遍推广的过程，对于大搞技术革命和技术革新的成果也必须这样看待。
    大搞多种经营，充分发挥建筑业的积极性，自力更生，战胜困难，力求更多更快更好更省地完成建设任务，是大跃进以来建筑业取得的又一个重要经验。根据建筑工程部所属建筑企业的统计，去年共办了二千九百多个工厂，制造了各种施工机械两万多台，生产了水泥十四万吨，钢七千多吨，铁两万多吨，砖五亿多块。这对于提高机械化水平，克服材料不足的困难，起了很大的作用。许多施工单位去年只用了70％到80％由国家调拨的材料，就完成了100％的施工任务。这是一个很大的成绩。但是有人却不顾这些事实，说大搞多种经营是“不务正业，得不偿失”。是不是不务正业呢？据调查，各地建筑企业所搞的多种经营，直接为施工服务的要占80％以上，间接为施工服务的占15％左右，只有少数产品是外销的。这怎么能说是不务正业呢？即使是种菜养猪，也可以改善职工生活，又有什么不好呢？至于说到得不偿失的问题，据建筑工程部的四个工程局统计，1958年搞多种经营共盈利三百万元。又据十一个省市和四个工程局的统计，今年上半年共盈利两千八百万元。多种经营产品的成本，绝大部分都低于市价。况且，对于多种经营，不能只算小账，不算大账。在建筑材料供应不足，机械设备条件很差的情况下，我们采取自力更生的办法，自产一部分材料，自造一部分机械，自己武装自己，增强主动性，更多的完成施工任务，这对于国家建设不是有很大好处吗？有什么得不偿失呢？我们不仅不应当否定多种经营，而且要提倡综合经营，把综合经营搞得更好。
    大搞共产主义协作，调动各个方面的积极因素，互相支援，共同跃进，也是大跃进以来取得的一个重要经验。建筑业的协作关系相当复杂，外部有和建设单位、设计单位、材料供应、交通运输、市政建设等各方面的协作关系，内部有总包、分包之间，各个工种、工序之间，职能部门与施工现场之间，加工企业与土建安装单位之间的协作关系，只有把各方面的力量统统调动起来，拧成一股绳，才能保证多快好省地完成建设任务。去年大跃进以来，各地区、各企业，由于进一步贯彻执行了政治挂帅，加强了党的领导，建立了施工现场的统一指挥机构，坚持局部服从整体、经济服从政治、小帐服从大帐的原则，因而关系大为改善，协作之风大为兴盛，大大促进了施工速度。
    大搞群众运动，是实现总路线的根本方法。去年以来，我们就是用大搞群众运动的办法，大搞快速施工、大搞技术革命、大搞多种经营、大搞共产主义协作的。可是，一些有右倾思想的人，却说我们大搞群众运动，“把企业搞乱了，破坏了正常的生产秩序”。这显然是十分错误的。
    我国建筑业十年来的成就是辉煌的，经验是丰富的，我们所走的道路也是正确的。但是，摆在我们面前的任务将更加艰巨和光荣，今后在继续大跃进的道路上，我们还会遇到许多困难。我们决心戒骄戒躁，在党和毛主席的领导下，高举总路线的红旗，坚决反对右倾思想，鼓足更大干劲，为在今年内提前实现第二个五年计划的主要指标，为加速我国社会主义建设而奋勇前进。（附图片）
