Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th: TASS reported from New York on the 8th: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the afternoon of the 7th. This meeting was hastily convened at the request of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to discuss a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Laos. In this letter, the Kingdom of Laos groundlessly accused the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of aggression, requested UN assistance, and requested the dispatch of UN emergency forces to Laos.

The President of the Security Council, Italian Representative Ortona, announced the opening of the meeting and told the members of the Council that he had received a note from Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 4. In this note, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stated that the United Nations should reject the slanderous statements and absurd requests of the Sananikone government.

Soviet Representative Sobolev, speaking, pointed out that convening this Security Council meeting was a violation of procedural regulations. Sobolev emphasized that the Soviet delegation would vote against including the Lao situation on the agenda.

After the vote on the agenda item, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld made a statement on the substance of the matter under discussion.

US Representative Lodge cited malicious and provocative rumors from the bourgeois press about Laos being threatened from abroad, and on behalf of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, put forward a proposal stipulating that a special committee of the Security Council, composed of representatives from Argentina, Italy, Japan, and Tunisia, should investigate materials related to the Lao situation and submit a report to the Security Council.

At the evening meeting on the 7th, Soviet Representative Sobolev spoke again. The Soviet representative said that everyone knows that the Geneva Accords stipulate a peaceful resolution of all internal problems in Laos, and stipulate the path of independent and democratic development for this country, and that the decision regarding the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada, is the most important provision of the Geneva Accords. The Vientiane Agreements concluded between the Lao government and the Lao Fighting Units in 1956-1957 stipulated concrete measures for resolving Lao political issues.

Sobolev continued, but the Sananikone government has refused to implement these agreements. This government took advantage of the temporary suspension of the International Commission's work and has been obstructing its resumption of activities until now. Since February 12, 1959, the Lao government has considered itself no longer bound by the Geneva Accords. Initially, this government carried out large-scale persecution and suppression of democratic forces domestically. Later, the Royal Army launched open military operations against the former Lao National Liberation Movement's fighting units. As a result, a serious threat of civil war has emerged in Laos, bringing various dangerous consequences to the cause of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The Soviet representative went on to say that what is particularly worrying is that these activities of the Sananikone government are directly linked to foreign interference in Laos' internal affairs, and the purpose of foreign interference is to turn this country into a foreign military strategic base in Southeast Asia. Increasing amounts of military materials and combat equipment are being transported to Laos, and foreign military personnel are arriving in Laos in droves. This is a crude violation of the Geneva Accords. Sobolev said that all the facts prove that the current dangerous situation in Laos is the result of the Lao government's violation of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements.

Sobolev emphasized that the US delegation's proposal to establish an investigation sub-committee proves that someone is suggesting that the Security Council take measures that undermine the Geneva Accords. The Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for maintaining peace, cannot condone measures that undermine existing international agreements. The Soviet delegation will vote against the proposal to establish a sub-committee.

Ignoring the firm opposition of the Soviet representative, the President of the Security Council put the proposal to a vote. Ten members of the Security Council voted in favor, and the Soviet delegation opposed it. After the vote, Soviet Representative Sobolev stated that the adopted resolution violates the UN Charter, violates procedural rules, and because one permanent member of the Security Council does not agree, it has no legal effect. He said that we are attending, in effect, a meeting that is tampering with the existing UN Charter.

    苏联代表在联合国安理会上发言
    谴责老挝当局撕毁日内瓦协议
    并反对美英法关于干涉老挝局势的提案
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：联合国安全理事会7日下午举行会议。这次会议是应联合国秘书长的请求为了讨论老挝王国政府外交大臣的一封信而匆忙召集的。老挝王国政府在这封信中毫无根据地指责越南民主共和国进行侵略，请求联合国援助，并派联合国紧急部队到老挝去。
    主持开会的安全理事会主席、意大利代表奥托纳在宣布开会时告诉各理事国说，他已经收到越南民主共和国总理范文同9月4日的照会。越南民主共和国政府在这项照会中说，联合国应该拒绝萨纳尼空政府的诬蔑性的声明和荒谬的请求。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言指出，召开这次安全理事会会议是违反程序规定的。索波列夫强调说，苏联代表团将投票反对把老挝局势问题列入议程。
    在对议程问题进行表决以后，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德就所讨论问题的实质作了一次发言。
    美国代表洛奇引用了资产阶级报纸关于老挝受到外来威胁的别有用心的、挑衅性的谰言，并且以美、英、法三国的名义提出了一个提案，其中规定由阿根廷、意大利、日本和突尼斯的代表组成一个安全理事会专门小组委员会，来调查有关老挝局势的材料并向安全理事会提出下一个报告。
    在7日晚间的会议上，苏联代表索波列夫再一次发言。苏联代表说，大家都知道，日内瓦协定规定和平解决老挝的一切内部问题，并且规定了这个国家独立和民主发展的道路，而关于由印度、波兰和加拿大的代表组成的老挝国际监察和监督委员会的决定是日内瓦协定的最重要的条款。1956—1957年老挝政府和寮国战斗部队之间缔结的万象协定规定了解决老挝政治问题的具体措施。
    索波列夫接着说，但是，萨纳尼空政府却拒绝履行这些协定。这个政府利用国际委员会工作暂时中断的机会，直到现在一直阻挠它恢复活动，而从1959年2月12日以来，老挝政府竟认为它已经不再受日内瓦协定的约束。开始，这个政府在国内大规模迫害和镇压民主力量。后来，王国军队对前寮国民族解放运动战斗部队发动了公开的军事行动。结果，在老挝出现了发生内战的严重威胁，从而给印度支那和东南亚的和平事业带来各种危险的后果。
    苏联代表接着说，引起人们特别忧虑的是：萨纳尼空政府的这些活动是同外国干涉老挝内政直接联系在一起的，而外国干涉的目的是要把这个国家变成外国在东南亚的军事战略基地。各种军事物资和战斗装备越来越多地运到老挝，外国军事人员纷纷到达老挝，这是对日内瓦协定的粗暴破坏。索波列夫说，所有事实证明，老挝当前的危险局势是老挝现政府破坏日内瓦协定和万象协定的结果。
    索波列夫强调说，美国代表团关于成立调查小组委员会的提案证明，有人建议安全理事会采取破坏日内瓦协定的措施。对于维护和平负有主要责任的安全理事会不能纵容破坏现行国际协定的措施。苏联代表团将投票反对成立小组委员会的提案。
    安全理事会主席不顾苏联代表的坚决反对，把提案提付表决。安理会的十个理事国投赞成票，苏联代表团反对。在表决后，苏联代表索波列夫发言指出，通过的这项决议违反联合国宪章，违反程序规则，而且有一个安全理事会常任理事国不同意，因此它没有法律上的效力。他说，我们出席的实际上是一次篡改联合国现行宪章的会议。
