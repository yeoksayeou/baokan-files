Wang Changyou is Good at Following the Mass Line
The No. 2 Workshop of Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill Educates Basic-Level Cadres to Learn From Him

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Huang Xiao reports: Wang Changyou, the foreman of the shaped steel section of the No. 2 Workshop of Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill and a Communist Party member, is good at following the mass line and has excellently completed production tasks.

This shaped steel section recently created a ten-foot-tall gantry planer, increasing production efficiency from only fifty kilograms of pig iron tiles in the past to one and a half tons of pig iron tiles now. The successful manufacture of the gantry planer was achieved by mobilizing all the workers in the section under Wang Changyou's soaring enthusiasm.

The good completion of the tasks in the shaped steel section led by Wang Changyou is inseparable from his arduous and simple work style and lively working methods. In production, Wang Changyou always consults with the masses on everything. Every time a major task is assigned, he first solicits opinions from individual workers to understand the situation, and then holds meetings of production team leaders and mass meetings of the entire section. In June of this year, the shaped steel section accepted the task of installing a 300mm rolling mill in twenty days. Wang Changyou explained the task to the masses, and the workers enthusiastically started a discussion: how to assemble, arrange a schedule, calculate the working hours for each part, and assign responsibilities... Because the masses were mobilized, they cooperated well during the installation process, and there were no delays. In the final stage of installation, there was still a shortage of twenty two-and-a-half-inch large screws. Requesting processing from an external factory would inevitably affect the progress of the project. Wang Changyou went to discuss it with the workers. The first time he found a maintenance worker, who said that he could turn out two or three in one shift. The second time he found an experienced master, who said he could turn out four or five in one shift. Finally, he found a lathe operator, who said he could turn out five or six in one shift. Wang Changyou brought the three of them together to study the problem. After exchanging operating methods, the twenty screws were turned out in three shifts, and the rolling mill started trial operation three days ahead of schedule.

Wang Changyou is also good at encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses and stimulating their initiative in his work, and he is also willing to learn from the masses. The factory assigned a batch of production tasks, requiring 50mm steel billets to be rolled into 10×45 flat steel. How can the task be completed quickly? At a meeting of team leaders, Wang Changyou put forward his own method: rolling twice on the flat plane and once on the vertical plane. Another worker suggested: use only two diamond-shaped grooves and roll twice to achieve the same specifications. After hearing this, Wang Changyou felt that this method not only saved a process but also maintained the steel's temperature. He immediately adopted this more proactive suggestion than his own, which increased the output of rolled steel by three tons per shift. There are many examples of improving production by leveraging the wisdom of the masses. Once, it looked like the worm gear of the pusher would break, causing the machine to stop. Wang Changyou ran all over the related factories to ask for a worm gear to be processed, but all the factories were busy and could not accept the order. He came back and pondered the problem with everyone. The factory did not have a milling machine, so what should be done? At this time, a sixth-grade worker, Yu Dejun, suggested using a lathe instead of a milling machine, fixing the milling cutter on the tool post, inserting the tool post into the indexing plate, finding the degree of the milling cutter, and starting the lathe. In just one shift, the worm gear machine was manufactured.

Wang Changyou is not only good at following the mass line in his work but also treats people with enthusiasm and sincerity, truly caring for people. During the heatstroke prevention and cooling period, when the rolling mill's temperature reached 1200 degrees, there were not enough spray fans, and they needed to be custom-made in Shanghai. Wang Changyou, an old steel rolling worker, realized that this was an urgent problem related to the completion of production tasks. After discussing it with the master workers, they imitated and manufactured seven spray fans. After they solved the cooling problem, the workers had even greater enthusiasm for production. Therefore, the production tasks of the entire section are always completed very well.

The workshop party branch promptly summarized Wang Changyou's working methods of applying the mass line in production and organized party members and cadres to study and discuss them. Through the study, not only Wang Changyou's working ability and ideological understanding were improved, but also the workshop cadres were encouraged to seriously apply the working methods of following the mass line in their work.

### 王长友善走群众路线  天津轧钢一厂二车间教育基层干部向他看齐

    王长友善走群众路线
    天津轧钢一厂二车间教育基层干部向他看齐
    本报讯　记者黄晓报道：天津轧钢一厂二车间型钢工段工段长、共产党员王长友善于走群众路线，出色地完成了生产任务。
    这个型钢工段，最近造成了一架一丈高的龙门刨，生产效率由过去只能刨五十公斤生铁瓦提高到能刨一吨半生铁瓦。龙门刨制造成功，是在王长友的冲天干劲下发动全段工人一起完成的。
    王长友所领导的型钢工段任务完成得好，是和他的艰苦朴素的工作作风，和生动活泼的工作方法分不开的。在生产中，王长友遇事总要和群众商量，每次大的任务交下来，首先在个别工人中征求意见，摸摸情况，然后召开生产小组长会，全段群众会。今年6月，型钢工段接受了二十天安装一台三百米厘轧钢机的任务。王长友把任务向群众交代，工人热烈地展开了讨论：如何装配，安排进度计划，计算每部分的工时和分工负责……由于发动了群众，在安装过程中互相配合得好，未发生脱工现象。安装到了最后阶段，还缺少二十个二寸半的大螺丝，请外厂加工吧，势必影响工程进度。王长友去找工人们商量。头一次找到保全工，他说一班能旋两三个，第二次找到老师傅，他说一班能旋四五个，最后找到车工，他说一班能旋五六个。王长友把三个人找在一起研究，经过互相介绍操作方法，二十个螺丝用了三班时间旋出来了，轧钢机提前三天开工试车。
    王长友还善于在工作中鼓舞群众的干劲，启发群众的自觉性，又能虚心向群众学习。厂里交下来一批生产任务，要将五十米厘钢坯轧成10×45的扁钢。怎样能迅速完成任务呢？王长友在小组长会议上提出自己的办法，走两次平面和一次立面槽孔；另一个工人建议：只用两道棱形槽孔，轧两次，可以达到同等规格。王长友当时听了，觉得这样既省去一道工序，还保持了钢的热度。他马上采纳了这个比自己的方法更为积极的建议，使每一班的轧钢产量增加了三吨。像这样发挥群众智慧提高了生产的例子是很多的。有一次眼看推钢机上蜗母轮要坏，造成停车。王长友跑遍了有关工厂，请加工造一个蜗母轮，但各厂任务紧，都不能承受。他回来和大伙琢磨来琢磨去，本厂没有铣床，怎么办呢？这时六级工于德俊提出，用旋床代替铣床，把铣刀按在刀杆上，将刀杆插在插盘上，找出铣刀的度数，旋床一开动，只用了一个班的时间就把蜗母轮机造出来了。
    王长友不但在工作上善于走群众路线，而且对待人热情、诚恳，真正做到了关心人。防暑降温时，在轧延高温达一千二百度时，喷雾风扇不够用，需要到上海定做。王长友是个老轧钢工人，他体会到这个关系到完成生产任务的问题急需解决，经过和老师傅研究的结果，仿造出了七台喷雾风扇。他们在解决降温后，工人生产劲头更大。因此，全段生产任务，总是完成得很好。
    对于王长友在生产中运用群众路线的工作方法，车间党支部及时进行了总结，并组织党员干部开展了学习讨论。通过学习，不仅提高了王长友的工作能力和思想认识，而且推动了车间干部在工作中认真运用走群众路线的工作方法。
