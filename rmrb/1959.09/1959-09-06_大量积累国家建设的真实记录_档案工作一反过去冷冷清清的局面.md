    Massive Accumulation of Authentic Records of National Construction
    Archival Work Reverses Past Cold and Desolate Situation

    (Our Dispatch) The archival materials preserved throughout the country, reflecting the past activities, are now serving the cause of socialist construction well.

    Under the leadership, care, and attention of the Party and the state, more than 1,200 county archives, 13 provincial archives, and many provincial archives preparatory offices have been established nationwide, preparing the necessary archival data bases for our economic construction and scientific research.

    With the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction across the country, archival workers actively and proactively carried out their work, reversing the past cold and desolate situation and "enlivening" the archival data work. Many archival data departments are "bustling with activity" all year round, with a constant stream of people coming to consult files.

    In recent years, archival staff have created many work methods that "provide convenience to others," providing a large amount of archival data to various construction fronts and playing their due role as assistants. Taking the Xichuan County Archives in Henan Province as an example, this archive provided more than 8,100 pieces of archival data related to agriculture, steel production, and other aspects to various departments last year, which greatly helped the central work and production. As another example, the technical archives department of the Beijing Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power supplied 145,900 copies of materials and 436,000 drawings in 1958, 118% more than the total supplied in the previous two years. The number of supplying units increased from 217 in 1957 to more than 700. These user units are located throughout the country, ranging from central ministries to some people's communes.

    During the design of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the water conservancy department urgently needed data on the largest flood volume and the smallest dry season flow of the Yellow River in history; this valuable data was finally found in the Ming and Qing Archives. The Ming and Qing Archives preserve the Qing Dynasty memorials regarding the water conditions of the Yellow River, which played an important role in the final determination of the design of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. The Hegang City Archives in Heilongjiang Province provided a set of mine plan drawings from the puppet Manchukuo period to the Xingshan Coal Mine, which was under construction, last year. The construction unit discovered from the drawings that there was an old tunnel above the tunnel under construction, with a large amount of accumulated water. They immediately took measures to avoid a major accident and loss that might have been caused. According to this set of drawings, small rails, water pumps, and other materials and equipment were also taken out from the old tunnel, and the coal reserves were further clarified, saving a large amount of exploration funds for the country. When Shanghang County in Fujian Province was building the Shanghang-Yongding highway, the construction design was more reasonable because it used the old archives preserved by the Shanghang County Archives, saving the country 15,400 laborers for 45 days. When Yuanjia County in Shaanxi Province was developing the Jialu River, the original plan was for 30 people to spend three years surveying. After the archival staff learned about this, they provided the preserved relevant archival data. As a result, it was confirmed that construction could be carried out without large-scale surveys, and the manpower and expenses required by the original plan could be basically saved.

    Archivists have also made good contributions in providing historical materials for cultural, educational and scientific research. The Nanjing Historical Data Compilation Office, in sorting out the reactionary ruling archives from the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919 to the national liberation over 30 years, used a large number of major historical materials to compile the "Compilation of Historical Materials on Modern Chinese Politics." The compilation is divided into four series according to the various revolutionary periods since the "May Fourth" Movement. After more than three years of meticulous work, the first, second and third series have been completed, totaling more than 17.4 million words. During this period, they also selected and compiled six special topics, such as "Historical Materials on the Revolution of 1911," "Compilation of Historical Materials on the May Fourth Movement," "Historical Materials on Soviet Assistance to the Chinese Revolution," and "Historical Materials on the Participation of the Chinese People in the Soviet Red Army," totaling 2 million words. All parts of the country have made extensive use of archival materials in compiling "Party History," "Revolutionary History," and "Local Chronicles." The Party History Compilation Committee of the Ruijin County Committee of the Communist Party of China has used revolutionary historical archives to compile a "Historical Materials on the Revolutionary Struggle of the People of Ruijin" of nearly 200,000 words, laying the foundation for compiling the history of the revolutionary struggle of the people of Ruijin, the first Red capital in Chinese history. The Ming and Qing archives and related parties have also sorted out the historical materials of major historical events in the past 100 years, such as the Opium War, the Sino-French War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Reform Movement of 1898, and the activities of Song Jingshi. Some of these historical materials have been published and have become historical books loved by educators and scientific workers. Local cultural and educational departments have also compiled books and lectures based on a large number of historical materials; literary and art workers have also referred to rich materials and written long poems and film literary scripts. Films such as "The Party's Daughter" and "Red Boy" were produced in this way.

    Archivists not only serve today with yesterday, but also think about people ten years, a hundred years, or even a thousand years later. They collect and preserve various archives since the founding of the country, especially since socialist construction, and on this basis, they have sorted out a large number of historical materials. For example, factories have compiled factory histories, and many counties have compiled histories of agricultural cooperation and commune histories. These authentic records reflecting the changes of the country will be passed on to future generations forever. (Attached pictures)

    The National Archives and Information Work Exhibition began in Banbidian, western suburbs of Beijing, in June this year. For several months, it has attracted countless viewers. At the exhibition, some people copied advanced work experience and methods into their notebooks for research and study.

    大量积累国家建设的真实记录
    档案工作一反过去冷冷清清的局面
    本报讯　保存在全国各地反映过去活动面貌的档案资料，今天正在很好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    在党和国家的领导、关怀和重视下，目前全国已经建立了一千二百多个县档案馆，十三个省级档案馆和许多省级档案馆筹备处，为我国经济建设和科学研究工作准备了必要的档案资料基地。
    随着全国社会主义建设大跃进，档案工作者积极主动开展工作，一反过去冷冷清清的局面，把档案资料工作做“活”了。许多档案资料部门一年四季“门庭若市”，前来调阅案卷的人来往不绝。
    几年来，档案工作人员创造了许多“予人方便”的工作方法，向各个建设战线提供了大量档案资料，起了应有的助手作用。以河南省淅川县档案馆为例，去年一年这个馆共向各个部门提供有关农业、钢铁生产等方面的档案资料八千一百多件，对中心工作和生产都有很大的帮助。再例如水利电力部北京勘测设计院技术档案部门，1958年就供应了资料十四万五千九百份，图纸四十三万六千多张，比以往两年供应的总和多118％，供应单位由1957年的二百一十七个增加到七百多个。这些利用单位遍及全国各地，包括上至中央各部，下至一些人民公社。
    在设计三门峡水库期间，水利部门非常需要黄河在历史上最大洪水量和最小枯水量的资料；这一可贵的资料，终于在明清档案馆找到了。明清档案馆保存着清代关于黄河水情的奏折，这对于最后确定三门峡水库的设计，起了重要作用。黑龙江鹤岗市档案馆去年把一套伪满时期的煤矿平面图，提供给正在施工的兴山煤矿使用。施工单位从图纸上发现，正在施工的坑道上面有个旧坑道，其中有大量积水，当即采取措施，避免了一场可能引起的重大事故和损失。根据这套图纸还从旧坑道内取出小铁轨、水泵等物资设备，并且进一步摸清了煤藏量，为国家节省了大量勘探资金。福建上杭县在修建上杭——永定公路时，由于利用了上杭县档案馆保存的旧档案，使施工设计更合理，为国家节约了一万五千四百个民工四十五天的劳动时间。陕西原葭县开发葭芦河时，原计划三十个人用三年时间勘察，档案人员知道后，即将保存的有关档案资料提供出来，结果肯定不必经大规模的勘察就可施工，原计划所需的人力和费用基本上可以节省下来。
    在为文教事业和科学研究提供历史资料方面，档案工作者也作出了很好的贡献。南京史料整理处在整理从1919年“五四”到全国解放三十年间的反动统治档案中，利用大量重大历史材料选编了“中国现代政治史料汇编”。汇编根据“五四”以来的各个革命时期分为四辑，经过三年多的细致工作，现在一、二、三辑已经完成，共有一千七百四十多万字。在这个时期，他们还选辑了“辛亥革命史料”、“五四运动史料汇编”、“苏联援助中国革命史料”、“中国人民参加苏联红军史料”等六个专题，共二百万字。全国各地在编写“党史”、“革命史”、“地方志”中大量利用了档案资料。中共瑞金县委党史编纂委员会利用革命历史档案已编写了一本近二十万字的“瑞金人民革命斗争史料”，为编写中国历史上第一个红都——瑞金人民革命斗争史打下了基础。明清档案和有关方面还整理了百年以来重大历史事件的史料，如鸦片战争、中法战争、义和团、戊戌变法、宋景诗的活动等，这些史料有的已经出版，成为教育、科学工作者所喜爱的史书。各地文教部门还根据大量历史资料，编写了书刊、讲义；文艺工作者也参考丰富的资料，写成了长篇诗章和电影文学剧本。“党的女儿”、“红孩子”等电影就是这样产生的。
    档案工作者不仅用昨天为今天服务，而且也为十年百年以至千年以后的人们着想。他们收集、保存了建国以来特别是社会主义建设以来的各种档案，并且在此基础上整理出大量的史料。例如工厂编写了工厂史，许多县编了农业合作化史和公社史等。这些反映国家变化的真实记录，将永远留传后代。（附图片）
