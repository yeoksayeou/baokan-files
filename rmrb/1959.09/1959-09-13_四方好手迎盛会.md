Reporters Lian Yunshan and Ai Tiemin

On the eve of the First National Games, our reporters made a whirlwind tour of the General Command and major competition zones. Everywhere we went, we found scenes filled with both tension and joy. In the newly completed Beijing Workers' Stadium, the freshly renovated Beihai competition area, and the Beijing Gymnasium, and dozens of other venues, colorful flags fluttered, slogan towers stood tall, and huge banners and posters were everywhere. The bustling visitors, the crowds of ticket buyers, and the energetic, rosy-cheeked athletes brought an unprecedented atmosphere of youth to these venues.

The Tense General Command

How does the organization and command center work for such a large-scale sports event? Arriving at the General Command, located in the National Sports Commission office building, one immediately feels the atmosphere of intense work. On the eve of the opening, the General Command convened a meeting of the heads of the twenty-nine provincial, municipal, autonomous region, and People's Liberation Army delegations. Comrade Rong Gaotang, the General Director of the Games, repeatedly emphasized the need to implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, which opposed Rightist tendencies and encouraged greater effort among athletes and staff. Each delegation also shared their experiences in conducting political and ideological work and pre-competition preparations, striving to make the National Games even more spectacular. In the Games Competition Department, the specific organizers of each competition were discussing the refereeing practice and its results. Veteran referees from all over the country, who once battled on the sports field, may not be able to compete with the young athletes today, but in order to make their judgments more accurate and reasonable, they have voluntarily organized themselves and conducted multiple practice competitions with the young athletes. For example, basketball referees played basketball. This method is very good, and it has helped to correctly resolve many special situations that could not be stipulated in the competition rules.

Iron Horses Gallop and Gunshots Echo in the Western Suburbs Competition Zone

Leaving Xizhimen and arriving at the Laoshan motorcycle racetrack in the western suburbs, one constantly hears sounds like jet planes roaring overhead. As the sound begins, one sees motorcycles speeding along the steep mountain roads, leaning into sharp turns as they race up the mountain. In an instant, dozens of motorcycles have sped past like lightning chasing the wind. In the parking lot, more than thirty people were lighting their engines, ready to go. Taking advantage of this very brief moment, the reporter spoke with an athlete from Jiangxi named Zhang Kai, who is twenty-three years old and originally a train driver. He said that he has the same feelings for motorcycles as he does for trains, because both are fast and both are useful to the motherland. Nearby, there was an athlete whose Mandarin was not very good. He came from Xinjiang, his name is Silajidin, he is twenty years old, and he is a Uyghur student at the affiliated high school of Xinjiang Normal College. He said that he only started participating in motorcycle sports this year. We had just finished talking when the starter waved the red flag, and the young motorcyclists mounted their iron horses and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

The reporter arrived at the Beijing Shooting Range competition zone at the foot of Fragrant Hills. In the military rifle shooting range, one sees a long row of sheds with about one hundred people shooting at targets, some standing, some lying down, and some kneeling. Near the entrance, Li Yonghuai from the People’s Liberation Army team consistently scored either a ten or a nine ring with each shot. In another practice range, more than twenty people were practicing rapid-fire pistol shooting. Liu Wenxiang, a young shooter from the Liaoning team, hit the bullseye with four out of five shots, and scored a nine on the fifth. The result was good, but coach He Shimin said, "Not enough, every shot should hit the bullseye."

In the athletics room of the Sports Institute in the western suburbs, badminton players from Guangdong, Hebei, and other provinces were practicing, performing long shots, short drop shots, and smashes, with great intensity. In the other sports fields of the institute, men's baseball and women's softball players from various provinces, wearing red and white uniforms, were also engaged in intense practice. We walked into the wrestling training hall, where practice had not yet begun. The young wrestlers were reading newspapers, and the walls were covered with big-character posters written by athletes from Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Hebei, and other provinces. In their big-character posters, they all unanimously supported the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, thanked the Party and the state for creating superior sports conditions for them, and expressed their determination to put politics in command, develop their skills, and achieve the best possible results.

The Workers' Stadium Competition Zone Presents a Magnificent Scene

As one approaches the towering and magnificent Workers' Stadium, the largest in the country, the tall buildings, the waving red flags, the huge banners, and the tidal wave of people that meets the eye, it is truly a magnificent scene. On the outer field of the central stadium, a group of athletes wearing sports uniforms of various colors were running and jumping. They were track and field athletes from more than a dozen teams, including Jiangsu and Jilin. Although the formal competition was approaching, they did not miss a single opportunity to train. On the track, sprinter Tong Zuolin from the Liaoning team, who had previously recorded a time of 10.6 seconds in the 100-meter dash, was practicing his starts again and again under the guidance of his coach, as a slow start was one of his weaknesses. Long-distance runners Huo Tianshun from Henan and Yi Kui from Inner Mongolia ran lap after lap with easy strides, looking determined to achieve good results. In front of the high jump stands, next to the jumping pit, and on the shot put field, dozens of athletes were training with great enthusiasm. Seeing these athletes studying and practicing hard, who could not believe that this Games would be a spectacular success! On the track and field field in the southwest of the outer field, group calisthenics athletes were holding previews. The "Celebrating a Bumper Harvest in Agriculture" performance by students from Girls' No. 3 Middle School and Girls' No. 9 Middle School began, with hundreds of girls holding golden ears of wheat, rising and falling together. From a distance, the wheat fields rolled like golden waves, truly evoking the feeling of "the wind blowing through the wheat fields, flashing golden light." Next was the staff demonstration from the martial arts exercise "Heroes Competing in Martial Arts," and one could see them flashing, stretching, leaping, and maneuvering with heroic postures and skilled movements. To their west, another team of male group calisthenics athletes were practicing marching steps. These male and female group calisthenics athletes who were currently rehearsing would be the first teams to perform for the audience at the opening ceremony.

A Great Leap Forward Scene in the City Competition Zone

On the afternoon of September 11, there were two exciting basketball games in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium, with the Hebei men's and women's teams both facing the People's Liberation Army teams. When the games started and one entered the hall, almost all of the more than six thousand seats were filled. As a result of the competition, the Hebei teams were full of enthusiasm and defeated their stronger opponents in both games. Whoever has more drive and whose thinking is more liberated can achieve victory, as was proven again by these two games.

In the swimming pool to the west, the swimming referees were conducting their final on-site practice. The competition among the athletes in the pool was very fierce, and the referees outside the pool were also performing their duties as seriously as in a formal competition.

Walking to the practice hall, one sees athletes sparring in pairs in front of twenty-four ping-pong tables. Some are playing singles, some are playing doubles, and some are playing mixed doubles. Among them are renowned veterans Rong Guotuan and Wang Chuanyao, as well as many young ping-pong novices making their debut on the battlefield, such as Deng Yongrong from the Guizhou team, who is only fourteen years old this year. However, she is already a first-class athlete.

On the green turf of the Beijing Gymnasium track and field, hundreds of athletes are received every day. On the high jump field, a tall guy jumped over the bar again and again. This young man is called Yin Keying, he is only sixteen years old this year, and is a middle school student from the Yunnan frontier. He has been formally training in the high jump for less than a year, and his current best result has reached 1.87 meters. Almost every delegation has such young players with not bad results. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, the younger generation is indeed awe-inspiring. At the same time, more than a dozen members of the Shanghai team were practicing hard on two sides of the football field. They did not play ideally in the finals, losing 5-1 to the Guangdong team. They are determined to achieve good results this time in the competition for seventh to twelfth place.

Walking south from the Beijing Gymnasium is the bicycle racetrack. This venue is welcoming such a large-scale competition for the first time since it was built. Many athletes are not yet very accustomed to competing on the racetrack. The weather is very hot, and the athletes are sweating all over in their wool pants, but the athletes from Fujian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are still riding their bikes lap after lap. The Heilongjiang team members are enthusiastic enough, and six male and female athletes, including Gao Guibin and Xu Xiuzhen, created new national records in the one-kilometer racetrack bicycle test.

Having traveled to all the competition zones, the overall impression is that all athletes and staff are full of enthusiasm after studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. In every aspect, everyone is showing a thriving spirit of fearing falling behind and striving to be the first. Although these impressions are obtained from a quick look, and are somewhat superficial, based on these impressions, people have every reason to believe that this National Games will definitely be a success and a spectacle.

    四方好手迎盛会
    本报记者　连云山　艾铁民
    第一届全国运动会开幕前夕，记者到大会指挥部和各主要赛区作了走马观花的巡礼。在这些地方到处充满着紧张而又欢乐的情景。在新落成的北京工人体育场，整饰一新的北海赛区和北京体育馆等几十个场地，处处是飘扬的彩旗，耸立的标语塔，巨幅标语和招贴画。熙熙攘攘的参观者，成群的购票者，以及精神奕奕面红体壮的运动员们，为这些场地带来前所未有的青春的气氛。
    紧张的大会指挥部
    举行这样规模盛大的运动会，它的组织和指挥中心是怎样工作的呢？来到设在国家体委办公楼的大会指挥部，人们就感到一片紧张工作的气氛。在开幕前夕，指挥部召集了二十九个省、市、自治区和人民解放军代表团的团长会议。大会总指挥荣高棠同志一再强调在运动员和工作人员中贯彻党的八中全会反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，各代表团也交流了进行政治思想工作和赛前准备情况，力争把全运会开得更精彩。在大会竞赛部里，各项竞赛的具体组织者们正交谈裁判实习的情况和收获。来自全国各地担任裁判工作的昔日沙场老将们，今天虽然不能和青年运动员们一决胜负，但他们为了把裁判做得更正确，更合理，都自动组织起来，同青年运动员们作了多次实习比赛，如篮球裁判就去打球。这种办法很好，使许多在竞赛规则中不可能规定的特殊情况，都得到了正确解决。西郊赛区铁马奔驰枪声震耳
    出西直门来到了西郊老山摩托车赛车场，这里不断响着有如喷气飞机凌空而过的声音，响声起处，只见一辆辆摩托车沿着险峻的山间公路疾驰而过，随着斜身拐了个大弯向山上奔驰而去。霎时间几十辆摩托追风闪电般地过去了。在停车场上还有三十多人正升火待发，利用这极其短暂的时间，记者同一位江西运动员作了交谈，他叫张凯，二十三岁，原来是火车司机，他说他对摩托车同火车同样有感情，因为都是速度快，都对祖国有用。近旁有位运动员汉语说得不很好，原来他来自新疆，叫斯拉吉丁，二十岁，是维吾尔族，现在新疆师范学院附中学习。他说他今年才参加摩托运动。我们谈话刚完，发令员红旗已动，只见这些年轻的摩托手们跨上铁马，眨眼就不见了。
    记者来到了香山脚下的北京射击场赛区。在军用步枪射击练习场，只见一长排棚子里，约有一百多人在打靶，有的立射、有的卧射，有的跪射，靠近门口的解放军代表队李用淮，每枪不是十环就是九环。在另一个练习场，有二十多人在练习手枪速射，辽宁队的青年射手刘文祥连打五枪，有四枪中红心，一枪是九环。成绩不错，但教练何士民说：“不够，应该枪枪中红心才好。”
    在西郊体育学院赛区的田径室里，广东、河北等几个省的羽毛球选手正在练习，他们长抽短吊，往来扣杀，十分紧张，而在这个学院的其他几个运动场上，穿红色、白色的各省男子棒球、女子垒球运动员也在进行紧张的练习。我们走到摔跤练习馆里，练习还没有开始，年轻的摔跤手们正在读报，墙上贴着黑龙江、山西、河北等省运动员写的大字报，他们在大字报上都一致拥护党的八中全会决议，感谢党和国家给他们创造的优越运动条件，表示决心要政治挂帅，发挥技术，做出最优秀的成绩。
    工人体育场赛区气象万千
    一走近巍峨宏伟的、全国最大的工人体育场，映入眼帘的高大的建筑，招展的红旗，巨幅的标语，潮水般的人流，真是气象万千。在中心运动场的外场上，一群穿各色运动衣的运动员正在奔跑、跳跃。他们是江苏、吉林等十几个队的田径运动员。虽然时间已临近正式比赛，但是他们一刻也不放过锻炼的机会。在跑道上辽宁队短跑运动员、曾创造百米十秒六成绩的佟作林，在教练的指导下，一次又一次地练习起跑，因为起跑慢是他的一个弱点。长跑好手河南队霍天顺和内蒙古队的伊奎，以轻松的步伐跑了一圈又一圈，看样子他们很有决心创造出好成绩。在跳高架前，跳坑旁边，铅球投掷场上，几十个运动员在干劲十足的练。看到这健儿们的勤学苦练，又有谁能不相信这次运动会会开得精彩呢！在外场西南边的那个田径场上，团体操运动员在举行预演。由女三中、女九中等学校学生表演的“农业庆丰收”开始了，几百个少女手执金黄色的麦穗一起一伏，远望去麦浪滚滚一片金黄，真有“风吹麦浪闪金光”之感。紧接着是武术操“群英比武”中的齐眉棍演习，只见他们闪、展、腾、挪，姿态英武，动作熟练。在他们的西边，另一队男子团体操运动员在整队练习步伐。这些正在预演的男女团体操运动员们将是开幕式上最先向观众表演的队伍。
    城内赛区一片跃进景象
    9月11日下午北京体育馆的比赛馆里，有两场精彩的篮球赛，是河北男女队双战解放军队。比赛开始，进到馆里，六千多个座位，几无虚席。比赛结果，河北队干劲十足，双双击败了实力比他们强的对手。谁干劲足，谁思想解放，就能得到胜利，从这两场比赛中又得到了证明。
    在西面的游泳馆里，游泳裁判员们，正进行最后的临场实习，池中的运动员竞争非常激烈，池外的裁判员也同正式比赛一样认真地执行职务。
    走到练习馆，只见二十四个乒乓球台子前，运动员正在捉对儿厮杀，有的是单打、有的是双打，有的是混合双打。这里边有中外闻名的老手容国团、王传耀，也有很多初上战场的年青乒乓新手，像贵州队邓永荣，今年只有十四岁。不过她现在也已经是一级运动员了。
    在绿草如茵的北京体育馆田径场上，每天都要接待成百运动健儿。跳高场地上，一个高个子，一次一次地跃过横竿，这个小伙子叫尹可应，今年才十六岁，是云南边疆的一个中学生。他正式练跳高还不到一年，现在最高成绩已达到一米八十七。像这样年青并有不坏成绩的选手，几乎是每个代表队都有。在大跃进的年代里，后生的确令人可畏。与此同时，在足球场上十几个上海队的队员正分两边进行苦练。他们在决赛中打得不够理想，一比五输给广东队。这次在争取七至十二名次中他们决心打出好成绩来。
    从北京体育馆往南走就是自行车赛车场。这个场子是建成后第一次迎接这样大规模的比赛。在赛车场进行比赛，很多运动员还不十分习惯。天气很热，运动员穿着毛裤，热得满身是汗，可是福建、吉林、黑龙江队的运动员，仍然骑着车一圈一圈地奔驰。黑龙江队队员的干劲够足的，他们在一公里赛场自行车测验中就有高贵斌和徐秀珍等六名男女运动员创造了全国新成绩。
    跑遍了各赛区，给人总的印象是：全体运动员、工作人员在学习党的八中全会文件后，个个干劲十足。无论在那方面，都呈现出人人恐后，个个争先的蓬勃朝气。这些印象虽然是走马看花得来的，有点浮光掠影，但，据此人们就完全有理由相信：这次全运会一定能开得好，开得精彩。（附图片）
