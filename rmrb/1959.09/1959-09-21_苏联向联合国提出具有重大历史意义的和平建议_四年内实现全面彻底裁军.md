Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 19th (TASS): The Soviet government submitted on the 18th a declaration on complete and thorough disarmament, along with specific proposals on this issue, to the United Nations for discussion.

The Soviet Union's new disarmament plan proposes to achieve complete and thorough disarmament within the shortest possible timeframe—four years.

The first stage proposes to achieve the following measures: To reduce the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the People's Republic of China to 1.7 million each, and the armed forces of the United Kingdom and France to 650,000 each, under appropriate supervision. The number of armed forces of other countries should be reduced to a number agreed upon by a special session of the United Nations General Assembly or an international conference on complete and thorough disarmament. Reduce the armaments and military technical equipment possessed by the armed forces of various countries, so that the number of armaments left is suitable for the newly stipulated number of armed forces.

The second stage proposes to achieve: The completion of the work of eliminating the remaining armed forces of various countries. The abolition of all military bases on foreign territories. Troops and military personnel withdrawn from the territories of other countries to their own national borders and disbanded.

The third stage will realize: The destruction of all types of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. The destruction of military equipment of the air force. A ban on the production, possession, and storage of means for chemical and bacteriological warfare comes into effect. All chemical and bacteriological weapons stored by various countries should be eliminated and destroyed under international supervision. Prohibit scientific research for the purpose of war and the manufacture of weapons and military technical equipment. Abolish all military ministries, general staff departments, all military and militarized agencies and organizations. Cease all military drills and military training. All countries guarantee to prohibit military education for young people through legislative procedures. All countries, in accordance with their own constitutional procedures, adopt legislative regulations to abolish all forms of military service—obligatory, voluntary, recruited, etc. Stop all forms of funding for military purposes.

The plan also stipulates that an international supervisory body should be established to supervise the implementation of complete and thorough disarmament measures. The scope of supervision and inspection should be appropriate to the degree of phased disarmament in each country.

The Soviet government's declaration stated that it goes without saying that the Soviet government is willing to realistically assess the current situation. If, for one reason or another, Western countries do not express their willingness to completely and thoroughly disarm at present, then the Soviet government, as before, is prepared to reach agreements with other countries on corresponding partial steps for disarmament and consolidation of security. The Soviet government believes that the main ones among these are: 1. Establishing supervision and investigation zones and reducing foreign troops within the corresponding countries of Western Europe; 2. Establishing a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe; 3. Withdrawing all foreign troops from the territory of European countries and abolishing military bases on foreign territories; 4. Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization conclude a treaty of non-aggression; 5. Reaching an agreement on preventing one country from suddenly attacking another country.

The declaration said that the Soviet government is deeply convinced that the Soviet Union's proposed method of thoroughly resolving the disarmament issue will ensure a fundamental turning point in the development of international relations, be able to establish an atmosphere of trust between countries, and create conditions for the peaceful life of the people of all countries. The Soviet government calls on the governments of all countries in the world, first and foremost the governments of major powers, to immediately jointly commence the realization of complete and thorough disarmament.

The declaration also elaborated in detail on the threat and harm of a new war, pointing out that complete and thorough disarmament is the way to free mankind from the disaster of war. (The full text of the declaration is on page six)

    苏联向联合国提出具有重大历史意义的和平建议
    四年内实现全面彻底裁军
    第一阶段：苏中美武装部队各裁减到一百七十万人，英法各六十五万人；第二阶段：取消各国留下的武装部队，撤销在外国的军事基地；第三阶段：销毁核武器、化学武器和细菌武器，撤销一切军事机构。如西方不愿意全面彻底裁军，苏联准备达成局部协议。
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联政府18日把一项关于全面和彻底裁军的宣言，连同对这个问题的具体建议提交联合国讨论。
    苏联这个裁军新计划建议在尽可能短的期限——四年内实现全面的和彻底的裁军。
    在第一阶段建议实现下列措施：在相应的监督下把苏联、美国和中华人民共和国的武装部队各裁减到一百七十万人，英国和法国的武装部队各裁减到六十五万人。其他国家的武装部队人数裁减到经联合国大会特别会议或全面和彻底裁军国际会议同意的数目。减少各国武装部队拥有的军备和军事技术装备，使留下的军备数量适合新规定的武装部队的人数。
    在第二阶段建议实现：完成取消各国留下的武装部队的工作。撤销所有在外国领土上的军事基地。军队和军事人员从他国的领土撤回本国国境并予以解散。
    在第三阶段实现：销毁各种类型的核武器和火箭武器。销毁空军军用器材。禁止生产、拥有和储存进行化学战争和细菌战争的手段的禁令生效。各国储存的一切化学武器和细菌武器都应在国际监督下予以取消和销毁。禁止进行以战争和制造武器和军事技术装备为目的的科学研究。撤销各军事部、总参谋部、一切军事和军事化机关和组织。停止进行一切军事集训和军事训练。各国保证通过立法手续禁止对青年进行军事教育。各国根据本国的宪法程序，通过立法条例，以废除任何形式——义务的、自愿的、招募的等等形式的兵役。停止任何形式的军事目的的拨款。
    计划还规定，为了监督实施全面和彻底裁军的措施，应当建立国际监督机构。监督和检查的范围应当适合各国分阶段裁军的程度。
    苏联政府的宣言说，不言而喻，苏联政府愿意现实地估计现状，如果目前由于这种或那种原因，西方国家不表示愿意全面和彻底裁军，那么苏联政府和从前一样，准备同其他国家就裁军和巩固安全的相应的局部性步骤达成协议。苏联政府认为，其中主要的是：一、建立监督和调查区，并缩减在西欧相应国家境内的外国军队；二、在中欧建立无原子区；三、从欧洲国家领土上撤退一切外国军队，并且取消在外国领土上的军事基地；四、北大西洋公约组织的成员国和华沙条约的缔约国签订互不侵犯条约；五、就防止一国突然袭击另一国的问题达成协议。
    宣言说，苏联政府深信，苏联建议的彻底解决裁军问题的方法将保证在国际关系的发展方面有一个根本的转折，能够在各国之间建立信任的气氛，并且能为各国人民的和平生活创造条件。苏联政府向世界各国政府，首先向大国政府呼吁立刻共同着手实现全面和彻底的裁军。
    宣言还详细地论述了新战争的威胁和危害性，指出全面的和彻底的裁军是使人类摆脱战争灾难的途径。　（宣言全文见第六版）
