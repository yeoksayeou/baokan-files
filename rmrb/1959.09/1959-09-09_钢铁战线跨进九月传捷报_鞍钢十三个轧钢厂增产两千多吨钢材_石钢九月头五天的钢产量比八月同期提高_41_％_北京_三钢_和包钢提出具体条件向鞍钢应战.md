Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 8th: The thirteen rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Company produced an additional 2,124 tons of steel more than the state plan from the 1st to the 6th.

    In order to strive for a "red September" in production and lay the foundation for completing the annual steel production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule, the workers of these thirteen rolling mills, after completing the August steel production plan five days ahead of schedule, comprehensively and meticulously arranged September's production based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The workers of each factory widely and deeply discussed and formulated specific measures to complete the September plan, further setting off a heat wave of production increase and thrift saving competitions combining performance competitions, collaboration competitions, and opponent competitions. Good news of technological innovation and new achievements continued to appear. Workers at the heating furnace of the rolling plate factory proposed: "Supply as much material as the rolling steel workers use!" Shearing workers proposed: "Cut as much as the rolling steel workers roll!" With the mutual cooperation of workers in various work types, this factory overfulfilled the state plan every day from the 1st to the 6th, producing more than 1,810 tons of high-quality steel plates. The workers of the First Thin Plate Factory focused on equipment maintenance and repair, which greatly reduced roll breakage accidents. From the 1st to the 6th, the utilization rate reached 86.1%, an increase of 3.6% compared to the state plan and 10.84% compared to August, exceeding the production plan by 3.8%. The workers of the small rolling mill further promoted many advanced experiences such as rapid steelmaking, rapid rolling, and rapid roll changing. In the first six days of September, they also overfulfilled the production plan by 8.3%.

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: In the first five days of September, the average daily production level of major products such as steel, iron, and steel materials of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company all showed significant increases compared to the same period in August: steel increased by 41.52%, coke increased by 21.13%, pig iron increased by 2.43%, and steel materials increased by 174%.

    On the 6th, the company's employees held a Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally, determined to further improve the production level and overfulfill the September plan. Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

    Encouraged by the Party Central Committee's fighting call, the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have set off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. The workers of blast furnaces and coke ovens actively improved technical operations and tapped production potential. The foremen and workers of the blast furnace held technical research meetings every day to unify the operations of the three shifts. The foreman of No. 2 blast furnace improved the measures for charging the furnace top and controlling the hearth temperature according to the changes in raw material conditions, and the production level rose day by day. Since August 26, the daily output has increased from more than 600 tons to more than 800 tons. The coke oven workers improved the fire adjustment operation and shortened the coking time of the coke oven by more than one hour. The No. 3 coke oven, which was newly put into production in May this year, shortened the coking time by five hours and reached its design capacity. The converter workshop and small rolling mill workshop, which were built in a rush during the Great Leap Forward last year, have made even greater leaps in September. The converter steelmaking workers shortened the smelting time and increased the number of blowing furnaces. In the first five days of September, the average daily steel production was 56 tons more than in August. The rolling steel workers strengthened equipment maintenance and improved the utilization rate of rolling mills. In the first five days of September, they overfulfilled the plan by an average of 12.4% per day.

    At the Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally on the 6th, Liu Changsheng and Hu Yaobang's speeches encouraged all employees to hold up the red flag of the Great Leap Forward even higher, to forge ahead bravely, to avoid arrogance and impetuosity, to continue to create greater achievements, and to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day and the upcoming National Advanced Producers Representative Conference.

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Beijing Steel Plant, Beijing Special Steel Plant, and the steelmaking workshop of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company cooperated with each other, which greatly improved the production level. In the first six days of September, they all successfully completed their production tasks.

    These three units have already proposed specific conditions on the 7th to respond to the competition initiative of Anshan Iron and Steel workers. The main conditions of Beijing Steel Plant are: Fight hard in September to increase steel production in September by 25% compared to August and steel material production by 84%; complete the annual plan fifteen days ahead of schedule. The Special Steel Plant proposed: Strive to complete this year's state plan one month ahead of schedule and produce 15,000 tons of steel more for the year. The steelmaking workshop of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company proposed to complete the September steel production plan seven days ahead of schedule.

    These three units are the main force of steelmaking production in Beijing. Under the Party's fighting call, the three units launched a vigorous socialist labor competition. In the competition, the workers frequently exchanged information, passed on good news to each other, learned from each other, supported each other, and carried out communist cooperation in a big way. On the 7th, the responsible cadres of the three units exchanged Great Leap Forward experiences together and also agreed on eight major technical cooperation projects.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 8th: The workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company warmly responded to the initiative of Anshan Iron and Steel workers to launch a socialist labor competition, ensuring that No. 1 blast furnace can quickly move towards normal production after being put into production, and overfulfilling this year's steel production plan.

    Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace has already been baking, and will soon join the national battle to seize 12 million tons of good steel. At present, the workers of the ironmaking plant are confidently doing all the preparation work for No. 1 blast furnace to be put into production. They will also learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal units such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Benxi Iron and Steel Company to ensure that the qualification rate of iron reaches more than 98% after the blast furnace is put into production.

    Baotou Steel workers held a production Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally on the 4th, at which they unanimously passed a letter of challenge responding to Anshan Iron and Steel's initiative.
