Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, Shanghai's nearly three thousand light industry and textile factories are joyfully rushing to produce large quantities of daily-use goods to supply the market for the holiday and the autumn peak season.

    This month, Shanghai's light and textile industries plan a total output value increase of more than 11% compared to August, reaching the highest level in ten years. The actual output of major products in the first half of the month, compared with the same period last month, shows increases in cotton cloth and cotton yarn; bicycles and sewing machines increased by 30% to 80%; cigarettes, soap, and dry batteries increased by more than two times.

    The variety of products has also increased. Most of the more than six thousand new products trial-produced from January to August have already been put into production, and some have already left the factory before the 15th to meet consumers. New products in the light industry system include enamelware, cultural and sports supplies, daily-use hardware, and daily-use chemical products. The Huafu Gold Pen Factory's National Day gift – the Shanghai brand gold pen – will not leak water even when the temperature difference is 40 degrees Celsius, and the nib is smooth and can write on several sides. The Shanghai brand ballpoint pen from the Wenshi Pen Factory and the high-end toys from the Shanghai Toy Factory are also of very high quality. Textile workers have prepared thousands of colorful new fabrics for people all over the country. Among them are Peacock Cotton, Hundred Flowers Velvet, Lantern Festival Wool, and Full House Red for women's spring and autumn shirts, as well as printed flannel with "Eleventh Night" patterns woven on the surface.

    These days, Shanghai is blessed with clear skies and refreshing air, which is a great season for the textile industry to increase production. On the 8th, 400,000 textile workers enthusiastically responded to the initiative of their counterparts in the capital to launch a competition. They are determined to achieve the highest historical output, the best historical quality, and the lowest historical cotton consumption in September, as a gift to the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country.

    This newspaper reports that some "missing" daily necessities from the city have recently appeared on the Shenyang market one after another. According to preliminary statistics, the city has filled in twenty-five kinds of daily necessities that it did not have and could not produce in the past, effectively supplying the needs of people's lives.

    These "missing" products that have been made up include handkerchiefs, elastic bands, lighters, stainless steel watchbands, shoe polish, thumbtacks, vacuum cleaners, locks, gasoline lamps, motorized toys, sewing machines, and various sewing machine parts. In the past, the city relied on support from other places for a long time. After the great leap in production in 1958 and the realization of communes in rural areas, the people's living standards greatly improved, and the demand for daily commodities greatly increased. Relying solely on support from other places could no longer meet the needs of the people. From the beginning of this year, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China led the light industry, commerce, and other relevant departments to conduct a general survey of "missing" products, and immediately began trial production and production.

    Under the leadership of the Party, thanks to the joint efforts of all parties, the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act was promoted, and various difficulties such as raw materials, materials, equipment, and technology were overcome, so that various new products were successfully put into production. Among them, 9,500 gasoline lamps have been produced, 10,000 dozen handkerchiefs have been produced, 58 dozen locks have been produced, 2,000 sewing machine frames have been produced, and more than 3,100 dozen shoe polishes have been produced, all of which have been put on the market. While increasing product output, all factories have also paid attention to improving product quality and increasing product varieties. The Zhujianlu Commune Lock Factory, in addition to producing two-inch large locks, has also added one-and-a-half-inch civilian locks, with good quality. There are already fifteen kinds of printed handkerchiefs, with bright colors and low prices, which are very popular among the masses.

    让大伙欢欢喜喜过国庆
    上海增产花样繁多的日用品
    沈阳制成二十五种“缺门”日用百货
    新华社上海电　上海市近三千家轻工业和纺织工业工厂的职工，正在喜气洋洋地赶制大量日用品，供应节日和秋后旺季市场。
    这个月，上海轻、纺工业计划总产值比8月份增长11％以上，成为十年来的最高水平。头半个月主要产品的实际产量和上月同期比较，棉布、棉纱都有增长；自行车、缝纫机增长30％到80％；卷烟、肥皂、干电池增长两倍以上。
    产品品种也增加了。1月至8月份试制出来的六千多种新产品，大部分已经投入生产，有些已在15日前出厂，与消费者见面。轻工业系统的新产品有搪瓷制品、文教体育用品、日用五金、日用化学用品等。华孚金笔厂向国庆献礼的产品——上海牌金笔，在温度相差摄氏四十度的时候也不会漏水，笔尖圆滑，几面可写。文士笔厂的上海牌圆珠笔和上海玩具厂的高级玩具，也具有很高的质量。纺织工人为各地人民准备了上千种彩色缤纷的新花布。其中有供妇女做春秋两用衫的孔雀绵、百花绒、元宵呢、满堂红等，还有布面上织着“十一之夜”图案的花哔叽。
    这几天，上海市天高气爽，正是纺织工业增产的大好季节，四十万纺织工人已于8日奋起响应首都同行展开竞赛的倡议。他们决心在9月份做到：产量历史上最高、质量历史上最好、用棉量历史上最少，向伟大的建国十周年献礼。
    本报讯　沈阳市场上最近陆续出现了一些本市的“缺门”日用品。据初步统计，该市已补上了二十五种过去没有和不能生产的日用品，有力地供应了人们生活的需要。
    补上的这些“缺门”产品中，有手帕、松紧带、打火机、不锈钢表带、皮鞋油、图钉、吸尘器、锁头、汽灯、机动玩具、缝纫机以及各种缝纫机零件等。这些产品，过去该市长期依靠外地支援。1958年生产大跃进和农村实现公社化以后，人民生活水平大大提高，日用商品需要量大大增加，光依靠外地支援，已远远满足不了人们的需要。从今年年初，中共沈阳市委就领导轻工业、商业等有关部门，对“缺门”产品作了普遍的调查，并立即着手试制和生产。
    在党的领导下，由于各方齐努力，发扬敢想敢说敢干的精神，克服了原料、材料、设备、技术等种种困难，使各种新产品顺利地投入生产。其中汽灯已生产了九千五百个，手帕生产一万打，锁头五十八打，缝纫机架两千副，鞋油三千一百多打，全部投入了市场。各厂在增加产品产量的同时，还都注意了提高产品质量和增加产品的花色品种。朱剪炉公社制锁厂除生产二寸的大锁头外，并增加了一寸半的民用锁头，质量良好。印花手帕已达十五种，颜色鲜艳，价格低廉，很受群众喜爱。
