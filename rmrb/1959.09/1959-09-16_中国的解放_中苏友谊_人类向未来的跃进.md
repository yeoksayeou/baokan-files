    The people of the world are watching China, which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of its liberation. They are as jubilant as people all over our country. They are enthusiastically assessing the great achievements made by our people in the past ten years; they are noting the good news this brings to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are looking to the future with us to see what China's progress portends for all mankind.

    Ten years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong announced the founding of the People's Republic of China, the final result of a revolutionary process that began a century earlier. This revolutionary process began with the Chinese people's resistance to the first imperialist aggression against our country in the Opium War (1840); then came the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution against feudalism and imperialism (1850-1864); after the failure of this struggle, Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities followed; and finally, the Chinese working class's vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, completed this revolutionary task. The Chinese Communist Party led thirty years of heroic struggle, in which the Chinese people defeated their three major enemies—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—and won a decisive victory.

    In this way, our people have become tempered steel. In this struggle, we preserved our tradition of showing perseverance in the face of adversity, a tradition established by the Chinese working people over thousands of years in the struggle against oppressors. Because the great truth of Marxism-Leninism was finally infused into this fighting spirit, we had the main prerequisite for saving and revitalizing the nation.

    Our people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, seized power, and the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China became the People's Republic of China, an achievement that shook the world. This is the greatest event in the world since its pioneer and example, the great October Socialist Revolution. On a vast and fertile land, a quarter of humanity was freed from shackles. After the completion of our New Democratic Revolution, our Socialist Revolution began. This revolution was carried out peacefully after the proletariat possessed state power. These remarkable and historic achievements are the result of the efforts of the Chinese people. These achievements are also extremely important proofs of the correctness of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese people have once again proved through their own victory that this worldview is universally applicable.

    For ten years, the Chinese Communist Party has continued to give us correct leadership, enabling our people to move from victory to victory and become increasingly powerful. At every important juncture in the development of domestic and international affairs, the Party and Chairman Mao Zedong have brilliantly applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism, been able to grasp the main contradictions, put forward correct solutions, and take appropriate actions. The Party has faithfully implemented the mass line in all aspects, encouraging the masses of the people to participate in our political life, production activities, and social and ideological reforms in the most extensive democratic manner.

    Our people's government is a brilliant example of applying the dictatorship of the proletariat to the specific conditions of China, taking into account our history and social customs. Similarly, the Party has resolutely led us to overcome the remnants of the old society at home and the imperialist enemies from abroad, who vainly attempt to reverse the wheels of history, but they are doing so in vain.

    The Chinese people have the deepest love and respect for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. They believe that the Party represents the best traditions of the Chinese nation and that the Party is a firm defender of our national interests. Therefore, when the Party calls on us to act, to build, and to defend the motherland and world peace with arms, the people of our country unite as one and respond to this call.

    In China's long history, our country has never been as united as it is today. The proletarian brotherhood unites more than fifty different ethnic groups into one close-knit family; China's industrial and agricultural productivity has never reached the heights achieved in the past ten years, and the brilliant prospects for our further development are also unprecedented; our culture and education have never been as flourishing and vibrant as they are today; China has never had such a high international standing as it does today, nor has it ever received such sympathy and congratulations from other countries and peoples, especially the countries and peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    Our people and country have come a long way in just ten years. Because our original levels of production and culture were very low and undeveloped, we still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do to complete our plans. But we have tested our strength, and we know that if there are high mountains in the way, we will remove them. We have firm faith in our cause and ourselves. We have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. All conditions are in place, and we can achieve far greater achievements in the next ten years than in the past ten years, making China stronger and our people happier.

    Since 1917, first during our long liberation struggle, and then after our victory, the Chinese people have been fortunate to receive the revolutionary comradeship of the Soviet people, their great Communist Party and government. On countless occasions, they have given us significant and decisive assistance in the spirit of true proletarian internationalism. We will never forget that whether in good times or bad, we can always count on the support of the Soviet people, while at the same time, the imperialists are conspiring to eliminate our country. Without the support of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people's struggle would have taken a much longer time and would have been much more arduous. Therefore, it is not surprising that we feel a family-like affection between us and the Soviet people. We say that Sino-Soviet friendship is eternal and unbreakable, and this is based on objective grounds.

    The rapid and comprehensive development of Sino-Soviet friendly relations is one of the significant achievements of the Chinese revolution. The political significance of Sino-Soviet fraternal cooperation lies in the following two aspects:

    (1) China's victory has linked the socialist camp together on a vast land with a population of over 900 million.

    (2) It enables Europe and Asia to combine according to a new type of relationship between nations and countries, a relationship based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism.

    Sino-Soviet friendship has become a symbol of the pioneering spirit of the world socialist system. This system was formed by the establishment of a series of people's democratic countries after World War II. Since the Soviet people victoriously built the first socialist country, human development has undergone a qualitative change. Sino-Soviet friendship is a result that closely follows this qualitative change. The twentieth century is an era in which people not only want to understand the world, but also want to change it. In this era, a series of leaps and bounds have occurred in some key scientific fields, and people are working hard to make science serve the production process. This gives mankind the power and ability to make nature obey their will and to increase the production of necessities to such an extent that the best things in life can be supplied to all nations without exception. Therefore, the problem facing mankind in this era is: through appropriate changes in the economic system (relations of production), to liberate the creativity of the people, to make huge efforts in production for all mankind, the results of which will be equally shared by all mankind, without any form of exploitation and discrimination.

    This is the demand of the working people everywhere in the world. Because our era is an era of widespread democratic development, an era in which the masses of the people want to participate in domestic and international political affairs. This is also determined by the social nature of modern production. People have gathered together and organized on a large scale to participate in the production of wealth. This makes people realize the potential of collective wisdom and labor, and realize that only these potentials can create material wealth from everything in nature. People now demand to fully utilize these potentials to eliminate the deep poverty and ignorance that still plague large areas of the world; people now advocate that the phenomenon of man exploiting man must be eliminated, and it is a matter of course that the working people have the inalienable right to own the tools and the fruits of their labor.

    Historical development has raised this question; mankind must answer this question in order to continue to make progress. People have tried to solve this problem by reforming the capitalist system, but found that the capitalist system is no longer reformable. Because capitalism inevitably embarks on the road of increasing concentration of wealth and power, it only intensifies the exploitation of the working class, thereby deepening social contradictions. People have also found that the growth of productive forces is often linked to terrible wars, war preparations, and the plunder of other nations, all of which only bring amazing profits to a few people and poverty and disaster to billions of people. In history, capitalism was once progressive, and it once played a positive role in how to free mankind from feudalism, but in this era, it has become an obstacle to the progress of most of mankind.

    The solution to the central problem of our time was discovered by Marx, Engels, and Lenin. They established a scientific theory that exposed the evils of outdated capitalism, gave people a new and clear philosophical point of view and a practical political program, so that people can complete the basic task of this era—the transition from capitalism to socialism. The October Socialist Revolution, which guided the way for the Chinese revolution and the revolutions of other socialist countries, showed the mainstream of global change. This is: the working class party leads the people to liberation, the people seize power and occupy the means of production, and then carry out planned, systematic, and efficient construction of a new society in which everyone has enough food and clothing. Only in this way can the painful backwardness, parasitism, and exploitation that mankind has had to endure for many centuries be eliminated in a short period of history.

    Marxism-Leninism has been undoubtedly proven to be correct through practice. It has brought great benefits to one-third of the world's population, giving them a beautiful socialist life and unlimited hope for communism. Marxism-Leninism is a beacon for all progressive mankind. Communist and workers' parties around the world creatively apply Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of each country, so that they can correctly and comprehensively reflect life and lead people to fight for the rights of working people, for national liberation, against reaction, and against war.

    We regard this great ideological system and summary of experience as extremely valuable wealth. One of the central principles of Sino-Soviet friendship is to unswervingly maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism and resolutely oppose all attempts to distort Marxism-Leninism with revisionism or to rigidify it with dogmatism. We strive to use Marxism-Leninism as a brilliant weapon of the most revolutionary class to transform the old society into a new society and guide the people in all parts of the world towards a life full of love, happiness, ideals, and high culture.

    The invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism unites China and the Soviet Union, and this theory is applied to all aspects of life. Our two countries are dedicated to the struggle against all forms of oppression. Our creed is: all workers are brothers, and all countries, regardless of size, are equal. This enables us to play an important role in helping to solve one of the most urgent problems in the world today, which is to permanently eliminate the evils of colonialism that politically, economically, and culturally bind various nations and countries.

    Because of the existence of the world socialist system, the working people in colonial and semi-colonial countries and in various countries that have recently won independence have more confidence in their own strength. The oppressed nations around the world are more courageous in carrying out this struggle, because they know that the socialist camp will support all those who uphold national independence. With this support, with the political, economic, and technical assistance provided by socialist countries, colonial and semi-colonial countries can defeat imperialism and consolidate their initial victories.

    The strong desire of every nation to gain freedom and determine its own destiny, coupled with the certainty that they can receive sympathy and support from the socialist camp, has formed a force that is driving the fierce and rapid political changes that have emerged in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in recent years. The colonial system is rapidly approaching its end. The billions of people in these key regions are no longer the reserve force of capitalism and imperialism. The world's political balance has swung in a direction opposite to that of the past few centuries, and towards the goals of national independence, peace, and democracy.

    Such a change will certainly not make the imperialists happy. They have been trying every means to regain their dominance, and one of their main methods is to transform certain independent forces in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to the right. The imperialists use anti-communist propaganda to deceive them, use promises of economic assistance to lure them, and lavish praise on this or that action of theirs, so that from time to time, they make the leaders of certain countries temporarily join the chorus of slandering socialist ideology, the Soviet Union, and China.

    Obviously, this will not have any good effect. It disperses the strength of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The people of these regions have a common enemy with the people of the socialist world—imperialism. Secondly, in today's world, it is simply impossible to oppose communism, oppose the Soviet Union, and oppose China without partially or completely selling out to imperialism. It is impossible to deceive all the people of these countries and make them oppose the main supporters of their national independence struggles. They will not fail to recognize that whenever the banner of national chauvinism based on anti-communism is raised, their independence begins to be pawned to their most vicious enemies.

    Facts are always facts; facts come from life itself; it is impossible to arbitrarily change and distort facts for some temporary political benefit. Those who harbor such attempts are nothing but adventurers. History is full of examples of how ambition and shortsightedness have led some people down the wrong path. All these people will eventually be liquidated by the people. Today, one thing is clearer than anything else: the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America know that their true friends in times of adversity are the Soviet Union, China, and other countries in the socialist camp. No force can change the relationship of unparalleled trust between us.

    The close relationship between the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the people of the socialist camp has great significance for the development of the world situation. It can especially help the forces of peace to defeat the forces of war. The Soviet Union and China act in unison, and they have always used their enormous strength to strive for easing international tensions, resolving problems through consultation, and maintaining world peace and justice. We have always strived to unite all those who can be united to work for this glorious cause. Over the past decade, the peace movement has greatly developed due to the growing strength of the socialist camp and the recognition by the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other places of the need to take action to save mankind from the horrors of atomic war. The socialist camp and the peace-loving countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have formed vast areas of peace. Now the peace movement has the power to stop the only forces that may launch a war—the monopoly capitalists of the West. This force is so powerful that today we can say that as long as the people remain vigilant and actively oppose war, war is no longer inevitable.

    The main feature of our era is: the coexistence of two opposite and competing world systems, one is the old capitalist system with a history of about three hundred years, and the other is the new socialist system with a history of only about forty years. People are increasingly aware of the need to avoid war and to recognize that peaceful coexistence is not only necessary, but also possible. Peaceful competition must take place between the two systems. This competition is underway. From this, we can already see the outline of future things and the characteristics of each system.

    In recent months, due to the consistent efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries to establish an international atmosphere based on peaceful coexistence, a significant decision has been made, namely that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev and U.S. President Eisenhower will visit each other, Chairman Khrushchev will go to the United States, and President Eisenhower will go to the Soviet Union. World public opinion warmly welcomes this action to improve the political relations between the two major powers of the Soviet Union and the United States. People recognize that this action will certainly be beneficial to further easing international tensions and promoting the cause of world peace. The Chinese people welcome this practice of mutual visits, believing that this is a victory for the advocates of the "Cold War" and a victory over the reluctance of some people in the United States to ease the world situation. We believe that this is a victory for the main principles that constitute the basis of the foreign policies jointly and individually pursued by all socialist countries, which is that countries with different social and political systems can and must coexist peacefully; the more friendly this relationship is, the more benefits the people of all countries will receive from it.

    Capitalist countries continue to move along the old path, plagued by signs of general crisis, including the maintenance of a large number of unemployed workers, huge national debts and personal debts, long-term agricultural imbalances, and low rates of economic development. In contrast, the Soviet Union has begun to fully unfold communist construction, and China and other socialist countries have also seen what some Westerners call "astonishing development of productive forces."

    The fact that the Soviet Union is carrying out communist construction is of extremely great significance. This is a head-on blow to the enemies of Marxism-Leninism. They never thought that socialism could be successfully established in the past. But after they saw the production statistics and the rising living standards of the countries where the people are in power, they no longer doubted the realization of socialist society. Now that they hear that communism is under construction, although they may not like this, they dare not deny the possibility of its realization.

    They have had to re-evaluate again and again since the historic day of October 4, 1957, when the first Soviet satellite began orbiting the Earth. After the appearance of the first Soviet satellite, the second and third Soviet satellites followed, and then an artificial planet with the Soviet emblem orbited the sun; recently, a high-altitude geophysical rocket carrying several animals and conducting research on the upper atmosphere was successfully launched and brought these animals back to Earth safely. These amazing achievements far exceed the achievements that the most powerful capitalist country, the United States, can achieve in these fields. These achievements have caused great shock among the most ardent supporters of capitalism. These great scientific achievements are a symbol of the enormous creativity produced in a collective society, and they have shattered the dreams of the United States and Western countries to dominate the industrial, scientific, and engineering tools of human material progress like soap bubbles.

    However, it doesn't stop there. When the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced its intention to embark on the comprehensive construction of a communist society, the outline of the advancement of all socialist countries and all mankind became much clearer. It is particularly clear that, with the promotion of mutual assistance, the pace at which the socialist world advances towards these goals will become faster and faster.

    In the capitalist world, everything is for the profits of big enterprises, and to become a strong country with more developed production, it is inevitable to sacrifice weak countries with less developed production. It is also very prominent that this difference continues to exist and expand, as if fate has destined some countries to be subordinate forever. As long as those countries continue to stay on the capitalist track, they have no other way out. They have to rely on strong countries, and they can only endure exploitation. The laws of capitalist development applied to the international economy can only be like this. They cannot expect those who take the highest monetary profits as the only purpose in life to suddenly become charitable.

    In the socialist world, things are developing in a different way. The basis of relations between countries lies in our common Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, and in the fact that all countries have socialist relations of production that represent the interests of the entire people. For all of our countries, the purpose of our society is to accelerate socialist construction, to make the days of communist construction come sooner, so that our people can obtain the richest living materials that nature can provide. Through the high level of fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries, the stronger help the weaker, the larger help the smaller, and in the process of achieving our common goals, the greatest interests of each country and its people can be satisfied.

    True, there are still some differences in the level of economic development between the various socialist countries. But this difference is caused by history, and this difference is precisely the goal we are working together to eliminate. Facts have proven that the distance in the level of economic development between socialist countries is being narrowed in a planned and balanced manner, and will eventually disappear completely.

    Completing this lofty and exciting task has great historical implications. The speed of socialist economic development is much faster than the economic development of the most advanced capitalist countries, even when these countries' economies reach their peak, as is rare. Socialist countries as a collective will use this speed to consolidate and complete socialist construction, and then engage in comprehensive communist construction like the Soviet Union is doing now.

    This will not only accelerate the development of socialist countries, but will also have a profound impact on the world. This will greatly increase the ability of the socialist camp to promote international trade. This trade will bring direct and indirect benefits to the newly independent countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which is very important. Through it, socialist countries will be able to give those countries more assistance, helping them fight for economic independence and against imperialist intrusion and control. At the same time, by making them no longer economically dependent on imperialism and finding other ways out, they will be able to force the imperialists to make concessions in order to retain a place in the market. Developing trade according to the principle of mutual benefit will further strengthen the entire foundation of world peace, while enabling the living standards of countries that have long been shackled by the colonial system to be generally improved.

    There is no doubt that the existence of the world socialist system, especially the existence of the Soviet Union with its strong economic power, is a powerful factor that can help every people's democratic country to build socialism today and communism in the future, to help the people of all countries that are still suffering from colonial exploitation to improve their conditions, and to develop friendship through international trade. On the other hand, the continuous mutual support and assistance within the socialist system is also very important for the continued development of the system itself. N.S. Khrushchev pointed out at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The development of each socialist country will strengthen the entire world socialist system. This is where our strength lies, and this is the guarantee that socialism will win in peaceful competition with capitalism."

    The Chinese people are receiving selfless and fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union in all aspects in the process of building socialism. We are also receiving valuable assistance from other socialist countries and the sympathy of working people and other friends all over the world. On this tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we express our deepest gratitude for this support. This support was very important for our past achievements, and it is equally significant for our future progress.

    Learning from the brilliant example of the Soviet Union, accepting the best experience from all over the world, and combining all this with China's specific conditions is the unswerving policy of the Chinese Communist Party. It guarantees that we can quickly achieve the goal of realizing socialism in our country and prepare to build communism that brings unlimited and far-reaching prospects to our people.

    The work facing the Chinese people today is to quickly and effectively complete the task of building socialism at home, and then devote themselves to even greater hydroelectric projects and the widest range of scientific and technological development, including atomic energy, electrification and electronics, automation and mechanization, biochemical technology, and so on. These are huge tasks that can only be accomplished through the joint efforts of socialist countries. In the future, when all mankind embarks on the broad road of socialism and communism, these tasks can be accomplished more effectively on a worldwide scale.

    In the era of the great Marx and Engels, socialism and communism were still an ideal. But in today's world, socialism is already a living reality, and communism will soon be realized. Today, ironclad facts prove that socialism is superior to capitalism. What is the standard for measurement? That is: socialism can make people feel secure in life and see a bright future, which capitalism can never compare with, even when its strength reached its peak in the past.

    Ideas are abstract, and it is easy to engage in empty talk. But reality is objective and real, and therefore cannot be denied. Today, people in all countries can see Marxism-Leninism and socialism being put into action, and can see that they have produced remarkable results in the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. These are facts that people can understand, and they are having a widespread impact around the world. They are the driving force for the rising workers' movement, and they are the source of ideological nourishment for the people of all countries, a source that will undoubtedly lead them to the victory of Marxism-Leninism on a worldwide scale; and the people of each country will decide for themselves when and how to achieve the great leap to the future. This is the path that mankind must take to move towards an era of continuous progress and happiness, and towards an era of lasting peace for mankind.

    As China enters the second decade of liberation and national construction, we are full of confidence. We are encouraged by the overall world situation of "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind."

    Peace is defeating war. National independence is defeating the shackles of imperialism. Socialism is defeating capitalism. We are proud to be at the forefront of mankind's march towards the future. We reaffirm the guarantee we made ten years ago: we will fight for the great communist ideal until there is no more exploitation of man by man, no more poverty, no more national oppression, and no more war.

    中国的解放——中苏友谊——人类向未来的跃进
    宋庆龄
    全世界的人民都在注视着正在庆祝解放十周年的中国。他们同我们全国各地的人一样欢欣鼓舞。他们热烈地估量我国人民十年来取得的伟大成就；他们注意到这件事为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民带来的好消息。他们同我们一起展望着未来，看看中国的进步对全人类预示着什么。
    十年以前，毛泽东主席宣布人民中国成立了，这是一百年前开始的一个革命过程的最后结果。这个革命过程是从中国人民在鸦片战争中（1840年）抵抗帝国主义对我们国家进行的第一次侵略开始的；接着出现的是反封建反帝国主义的太平天国农民革命（1850——1864）；在这场斗争失败以后，接着出现了孙中山的革命活动；最后由中国工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党完成了这个革命任务。中国共产党领导了三十年的英勇斗争，在这场斗争中，中国人民击败了他们的三大敌人——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义——而赢得了决定性的胜利。
    这样，我国人民就百炼成钢。在这场斗争中，我们保存了我们在面临逆境时表现刚毅不拔的气概的传统，这是中国劳动人民几千年来在反抗压迫者的斗争中建立的传统。由于在这种战斗精神中最后灌注了马克思列宁主义的伟大真理，我们就有了拯救民族、复兴民族的主要先决条件。
    我国人民在中国共产党的领导下取得了政权，半封建半殖民地的旧中国变成了中华人民共和国，这是一个震撼世界的成就。这是在它的先驱者和榜样——伟大的十月社会主义革命——以后世界上发生的最大的事件。在一片广阔而富饶的土地上，四分之一的人类挣脱了枷锁。在我们的新民主主义革命完成了以后，就开始了我们的社会主义革命。这场革命是在无产阶级拥有政权之后用和平方式进行的。这些引人注目的具有历史意义的成就是中国人民努力的结果。这些成就也是马克思列宁主义学说正确性的极其重要的证明。中国人民通过自己的胜利再一次证明这种世界观是普遍适用的。
    十年以来，中国共产党继续给我们以正确的领导，使我国人民能够从胜利走向胜利，力量日益强大。在国内与国际事务发展中的每一个重要关头，党和毛泽东主席都英明地运用了马克思列宁主义原理，能够抓住主要矛盾，提出正确的解决办法，采取恰当的行动。党在一切方面都忠实地贯彻了群众路线，鼓励人民群众以民主方式最广泛地参加我们的政治生活、生产活动、社会方面和意识形态方面的改革。
    我们的人民政府是在考虑到我们的历史和社会习惯的情况下把无产阶级专政应用于中国具体条件的光辉榜样。同样地，党也坚决地领导我们战胜国内旧社会的残余和外来的敌人帝国主义者，这些人妄想扭转历史的车轮，但是他们是白费心机。
    中国人民对中国共产党和毛泽东主席怀着最深切的热爱和尊敬。他们认为党代表着中华民族最优良的传统，党是我们民族利益的坚定的保卫者。因此，当党号召我们行动、建设、手执武器保卫祖国和世界和平的时候，我国人民就团结得像一个人一样，起来响应这个号召。
    在中国悠久的历史中，我国从来没有像今天这样团结，无产阶级的兄弟情谊使五十多个不同的民族结合在一个亲密无间的大家庭中；中国的工农业生产率从来没有达到过去十年来达到的高度，我们取得进一步发展的光辉前景也是前所未有的；我们的文化教育从来没有像今天这样百花盛开、生气蓬勃；中国从来没有过今天这样高的国际地位，也从没有像今天这样得到其他国家和人民、特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的国家和人民的同情和祝贺。
    我们的人民和国家，在仅仅十年当中已经走了很大一段路。由于我们原有的生产和文化水平很低、很不发达，我们还要走相当长的路程，还要努力做很多工作，才能完成我们的计划。可是我们已经考验了自己的力量，我们知道如果前面有高山挡路，我们也会把它们移去。我们对于我们的事业和我们自己，具有坚定的信念。我们有中国共产党的领导。一切条件都已具备，我们在未来十年中能够取得远比过去十年更大的成就，使中国更加强盛，使我们的人民更加幸福。
    自从一九一七年以来，首先是在我们长期的解放斗争过程中，然后在我们取得胜利以后，中国人民都很幸运地得到苏联人民、他们伟大的共产党和政府的革命的同志情谊。在无数的场合，他们本着真正的无产阶级国际主义的精神，给予我们以重大的、决定性的援助。我们永远不会忘记：无论是在顺利的日子里还是在不顺利的日子里，我们始终能指望得到苏联人民的支持，而在这同时，帝国主义却在阴谋消灭我们国家。如果没有苏联的支持，中国人民的斗争就会经历更加长得多的时间，而且会更加艰苦。因此我们感到我们同苏联人民之间有着亲如一家的感情，这是毫不奇怪的。我们说苏中友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的，这样说是有客观根据的。
    中苏友好关系得到迅速的、全面的发展是中国革命的显著成果之一。中苏之间的兄弟合作的政治意义在于以下两个方面：
    （一）中国的胜利，使得社会主义阵营在一片拥有九亿以上人口的辽阔的土地上连结在一起。
    （二）它使得欧洲和亚洲按照一种新型的民族与国家之间的关系相结合，这种关系是建立在马克思列宁主义的理论的基础上的。
    中苏友谊已经成为世界社会主义体系的开创精神的象征。这个体系是由于第二次世界大战以后建立了一系列人民民主国家而形成的。由于苏联人民胜利地建成了第一个社会主义国家，人类的发展就起了质的变化。中苏友谊就是紧跟着这种质的变化而产生的。二十世纪是一个人们不仅要认识世界，而且要改变世界的时代。在这个时代，在一些关键性的科学领域内，出现了一系列的突飞猛进的发展，人们努力使科学为生产过程服务。这就使得人类有力量、有能力让自然服从于他们的意志，并把生活必需品的生产提高到这样一个地步，使生活中的最美好的东西都能无例外地供给所有的民族。因此这个时代摆在人类面前的问题是：通过经济制度（生产关系）的适当的改变，来解放人民的创造力，在生产方面为全人类作出巨大的努力，这种努力的成果将由全人类平等地分享，而绝对没有任何形式的剥削与歧视。
    这就是世界上每一个地方的劳动人民的要求。因为我们的时代是民主要广泛发展的时代，是人民群众要参加国内和国际政治事务的时代。这也是近代生产的社会性所决定的。人们已经集中起来，并且大规模地组织起来参加生产财富。这就使人们认识到集体智慧和劳动的潜力，认识到只有这些潜力才能够从自然界的万物中创造出物质财富。人们现在要求充分发挥这些潜力，以消灭依然危害着世界上大片地区的深重的贫穷和愚昧；人们现在主张人剥削人的现象必须消灭，劳动人民有着拥有工具和他们的劳动果实的不容剥夺的权利，这是理所当然的事。
    历史的发展提出了这个问题；人类必须回答这个问题才能继续得到进步。人们曾试图通过对资本主义制度进行改良来解决这个问题，但是发现资本主义制度已无法改良了，由于资本主义不可避免地走上了财富和权力日益集中的道路，它只是加重了对工人阶级的剥削，从而加深了社会的矛盾。人们还发现生产力的增长常常同可怕的战争、战争准备和对其他民族的掠夺联系在一起，这一切只是为少数人带来了惊人的利润，而为亿万人带来了贫困和灾难。在历史上，资本主义一度是进步的，它曾对于如何使人类摆脱封建主义的问题起过积极作用，但是在现在这个时代，它已成为大部分人类前进道路上的障碍。
    解决我们时代的中心问题的办法是由马克思、恩格斯和列宁发现的。他们建立了揭露过时的资本主义的罪恶的科学理论，给人们一种新的明确的哲学观点和一个实际的政治纲领，从而使人们能完成这个时代的基本任务——从资本主义过渡到社会主义。为中国的革命和其他社会主义国家的革命指引道路的十月社会主义革命，显示了全世界的变革的主流。这就是：工人阶级政党引导人民走向解放，人民掌握政权并占有生产资料，然后再进行有计划、有系统、有效率地建设人人丰衣足食的新社会。只有这样，才能在历史上的一个短时期内，消灭许多世纪以来人类一直不得不忍受的痛苦的落后状态、寄生现象和剥削。
    马克思列宁主义已经通过实践而肯定无疑地证明了它的正确性。它已经为世界上三分之一的人口带来了很大的好处，给予他们以社会主义的美好生活和共产主义的无限希望。马克思列宁主义是全体进步人类的灯塔。全世界的共产党和工人党把马克思列宁主义创造性地应用于每个国家的具体条件，这样他们就能正确地、全面地反映生活，并且领导人们为争取劳动人民的权利、争取民族解放、反对反动、反对战争而斗争。
    我们把这个伟大的思想体系和经验的概括看作是极其宝贵的财富。中苏友谊的中心原则之一就是毫不含糊地维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，坚决反对用修正主义来歪曲或者用教条主义来僵化马克思列宁主义的一切企图。我们努力把马克思列宁主义当作最革命阶级的光辉武器，来把旧社会变成新社会，并且引导世界上各个地方的人民走向一种充满友爱、幸福、理想和高度文化的生活。
    不可战胜的马克思列宁主义理论使中国和苏联结合在一起，这个理论被应用于生活的一切方面。我们两国献身于反对一切形式的压迫的斗争。我们的信条是：一切劳动者都是兄弟，一切国家不论大小都一律平等。这使得我们能够在帮助解决当前世界上最紧急的一个问题时起着重要的作用，这个问题就是永远消灭在政治上、经济上和文化上束缚各个民族和国家的罪恶的殖民主义。
    因为世界社会主义体系的存在，殖民地和半殖民地国家以及最近赢得独立的各个国家的劳动人民就更加信任自己的力量。世界各地的被压迫民族更加有勇气进行这场斗争，因为他们知道社会主义阵营会支持一切维护民族独立的人。由于有了这种支持，有了社会主义各国所给予的政治上、经济上和技术上的援助，殖民地和半殖民地国家就能够战胜帝国主义，并且巩固他们的初步的胜利。
    每个民族都有着获得自由和决定自己命运的强烈的愿望，再加上他们肯定可以从社会主义阵营得到同情和支持，这样就形成了一股力量，推动着近年来在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲出现的激烈而急剧的政治变革。殖民主义体系正在迅速走向它的末日。这些关键性地区的亿万人民已经不再是资本主义和帝国主义的后备军了。世界上的政治天平已经向着与几百年来相反的方向摆动，而倒向民族独立、和平和民主的目标了。
    这样一个变化当然不会使帝国主义者高兴。他们一直千方百计地想要夺回他们的统治地位，他们的主要办法之一就是使得亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的某些民族独立的力量向右转化。帝国主义者用反共宣传蒙蔽他们，用经济援助的诺言引诱他们，并且对他们这一行动或那一行动大事恭维，这样就不时地使某些国家的领导人物暂时参加对社会主义思想、对苏联和中国进行诽谤的合唱队。
    显然，这不会有什么好作用。它涣散亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的力量。这些地区的人民同社会主义世界的人民有着一个共同的敌人——帝国主义。其次，在今天的世界上，要反共、反苏、反对中国而不部分地或者全部地卖身投靠帝国主义，那简直是不可能的。要想欺骗这些国家的全体人民，使他们去反对他们民族独立斗争的主要支持者，那是不可能的。他们不会不认识，每当打起以反共为基础的民族沙文主义的旗子的时候，他们的独立就开始被典押给他们的最凶恶的敌人。
    事实总是事实；事实来自生活本身；要想为了某种暂时的政治利益而任意改变和歪曲事实是不可能的。那些怀有这种企图的人不过是一些冒险者。历史上充满了因为野心和近视而使得某些人走上错误道路的例子。所有这些人终于遭到人民的清算。今天有一件事情比其他任何事情都要清楚：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民知道，他们真正的患难中的朋友正是苏联、中国和社会主义阵营的其他国家。没有任何力量能够改变我们之间无比信任的关系。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民和社会主义阵营的人民之间的亲密的关系，对于世界局势的发展有着重大的意义。它特别可以帮助和平力量战胜战争力量。苏中两国行动一致，它们始终利用自己的巨大力量来争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取通过协商来解决问题，维护世界和平和正义。我们一向努力团结一切能够团结的人们来为这个光辉事业而努力。过去十年里，由于社会主义阵营的力量日益壮大，由于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他地方的人民认识到有必要采取行动，把人类从原子战争的恐怖中拯救出来，和平运动已经有了很大的发展。社会主义阵营和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲爱好和平的国家，已经形成广大的和平地区。现在和平运动已经有力量要唯一可能发动战争的势力——西方的垄断资本家——住手。这种力量是这样强大，因而今天我们能够说：只要人民保持警惕，积极地反对战争，战争已不再是不可避免的。
    我们的时代的主要特点是：两个相反的、互相竞争的世界体系同时并存，一个是有着大约三百年历史的旧的资本主义体系，另一个是只有大约四十年历史的新的社会主义体系。人们愈来愈认识到有必要避免战争，认识到和平共处不仅是必要的，而且是可能的。和平竞赛要在两个体系之间进行。这场比赛正在进行中。从这里面，我们已经可以看出未来事物的轮廓和每一个体系的特点。
    最近若干个月中，由于苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家一贯努力建立以和平共处为基础的国际气氛，结果产生了一个意义重大的决定，就是苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和美国总统艾森豪威尔将互相访问，赫鲁晓夫主席将前往美国，艾森豪威尔总统将前往苏联。世界舆论热烈欢迎这个改善苏美两大国之间的政治关系的行动。人们认识到，这个行动对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和促进世界和平事业一定会是有益的。中国人民欢迎这种互相访问的做法，认为这是对“冷战”鼓吹者的一个胜利，是对美国某些人士不愿缓和世界局势的态度的一个胜利。我们认为这是构成一切社会主义国家共同奉行和单独奉行的外交政策的基础的主要原则的胜利，这个原则是：有着不同社会和政治制度的国家可以而且必须在和平的条件下共处；这种关系愈友好，各国人民从这里面得到的好处就愈多。
    资本主义国家继续沿着老路前进，受到总危机的征象的侵袭，这些征象包括经常保持很大数目的失业工人大军、庞大的国债和个人债务、长期性的农业不平衡和低速度的经济发展。与此相反，苏联已经开始全面展开共产主义建设，中国和其他的社会主义国家也出现了某些西方人士所说的“生产力的惊人的发展”。
    苏联正在进行共产主义建设这个事实有着极其重大的意义。这对马克思列宁主义的敌人来说，是当头一棒。他们过去从来没有想到社会主义能够成功地建立起来。但是他们看到了人民当政的国家的生产统计数字和日益提高的生活水平以后，对于社会主义社会的实现就不再有怀疑了。如今他们听说共产主义正在建设的过程中，虽然他们可能不喜欢这种事情，但是他们却不敢否定它的实现的可能性。
    自从在一九五七年十月四日这个富有历史意义的日子，第一颗苏联人造卫星开始环绕着地球飞行以来，他们不得不一再重新进行估量。在第一颗苏联人造卫星出现以后，接着出现了第二颗和第三颗苏联人造卫星，然后有带有苏联国徽的人造行星环绕着太阳飞行；最近载有几个动物、对大气高层进行研究的高空地球物理火箭又发射成功，并且把这些动物安全地带回地球。这些惊人的成就远远超过了最强大的资本主义国家美国在这些领域中所能达到的成就。这些成就在资本主义的最热心的支持者当中引起了巨大的震动。这些伟大的科学成就是一个集体社会中所产生的巨大创造力的象征，它们使得美国和西方国家妄想在工业、科学和工程技术等人类物质进步的工具方面占统治地位的美梦，像肥皂泡一般化为乌有了。
    然而，事情还不止于此。当苏联共产党宣布打算着手全面建设共产主义社会的时候，一切社会主义国家以及全人类向前迈进的轮廓就变得更加清楚得多了。特别清楚的是，在互相帮助的促进之下，社会主义世界向这些目标前进的步伐将变得愈来愈快。
    在资本主义世界，一切都是为了大企业的利润，一个国家要获得生产较发达的强国地位，就不可避免地要牺牲生产不大发达的弱国。同样非常突出的是这个差异继续存在并且扩大，仿佛命运注定有些国家只能永远处于从属地位。只要那些国家继续留在资本主义的轨道内，它们就没有别的出路，它们要依靠强国，就只能忍受剥削，资本主义的发展规律应用在国际经济上，就只能是这样。它们不能指望那些以最高的金元利润为人生唯一目的的人们会突然变得慈善起来。
      在社会主义世界，事情却以不同的方式发展着。各国之间的关系的基础在于我们的共同的马克思列宁主义观点，在于所有国家都有着代表全体人民利益的社会主义生产关系。对于我们所有的国家来说，我们的社会的目的都是加速社会主义建设，使共产主义建设的日子早日来到，使我们的人民能够得到自然界所能提供的最丰富的生活资料。通过社会主义国家间的高度的兄弟般的互助合作，较强的帮助较弱的，大的帮助小的，在实现我们共同目标的过程中，每个国家及其人民的最大利益都可以得到满足。
    不错，各个社会主义国家之间在经济发展水平上仍然存在着一些差异。可是这种差异是历史造成的，而且这种差异正是我们同心协力努力消除的目标。事实证明，社会主义国家之间经济发展水平上的距离正在有计划地、均衡地予以缩小，最后将完全消失。
    完成这个崇高的、令人兴奋的任务有着极大的历史影响。社会主义的经济发展速度比最先进的资本主义国家的经济发展速度还要快得多，甚至在这些国家的经济达到高峰那样罕见的时候也是如此。社会主义各国作为一个集体将要利用这种速度来巩固和完成社会主义建设，然后像苏联目前那样去从事全面的共产主义建设。
    这不仅将加速社会主义国家的发展，而且对于全世界也将有深远的影响。这将会大大提高社会主义阵营促进国际贸易的能力。这种贸易将为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲新近独立的国家带来直接和间接的利益，这一点是很重要的。通过它，社会主义国家将能给那些国家以更多的援助，帮助它们为争取经济独立、反对帝国主义侵入和控制而斗争。同时，由于使它们在经济上不再依赖帝国主义，而找到另外的出路，它们将能迫使帝国主义者为了在市场上保留一席地位而作出让步。根据互利的原则发展贸易将会进一步加强世界和平的整个基础，同时使得那些长期受着殖民制度羁绊的国家的生活水平能够得到普遍的提高。
    毫无疑问，世界社会主义体系的存在，特别是具有强大经济力量的苏联的存在，是一个强大的因素，它可以帮助每一个人民民主国家在今天建设社会主义，在将来建设共产主义，帮助仍然遭受殖民主义剥削的各国人民改善他们的状况，并且通过国际贸易来发展友谊。另一方面，社会主义体系内部的源源不绝的相互支持和帮助对于这个体系本身的继续发展也是十分重要的。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会上指出：“每一个社会主义国家的发展都会加强整个世界社会主义体系。这就是我们力量之所在，这就是社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛中将取得胜利的保证。”
    中国人民在建设社会主义的过程中，正在得到苏联各方面的、无私的兄弟援助。我们也正在得到其他社会主义国家的宝贵的援助，而且得到全世界劳动人民和其他朋友的同情。在这中华人民共和国建国十周年的时候，我们对这种支持表示最深切的感谢。这种支持对于我们过去的成就十分重要，对于我们未来的进步也有着同样的意义。
    向苏联的光辉榜样学习，接受全世界的最好的经验，把这一切同中国的具体情况相结合，这是中国共产党坚持不渝的政策。它保证我们能够迅速地达到在我国实现社会主义的目标，而准备建立为我们的人民带来无限远大的前程的共产主义。
    今天摆在中国人民面前的工作，是迅速而有效地完成在国内建成社会主义的任务，然后致力于更加巨大的水电工程和最大范围内的科学技术发展，其中包括原子能、电气化和电子学、自动化和机械化、生物化学技术等等。这些都是庞大的工作，只有社会主义国家通力合作才能完成。在将来，当全人类走上社会主义和共产主义的康庄大道时，就能在全世界范围以内更有效地完成这些工作。
    在伟大的马克思和恩格斯的时代，社会主义和共产主义还是一个理想。但是在今天的世界上，社会主义已经是一个活生生的现实，共产主义不久也将实现。今天铁的事实证明，社会主义要比资本主义优越。什么是用以衡量的标准呢？这就是：社会主义能够使人民感到生活有保障，看到光辉的前景，这是资本主义永远不能比得过的，即使在过去它的力量达到高峰时期也从来不能比过。
    思想是抽象的，发空论是容易的。但是现实是客观的、实在的，因而是不能否认的。如今各国人民能够看到马克思列宁主义和社会主义正在见诸行动，能够看到它们在苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家产生了显著的成果。这些都是人们能够理解的事实，它们正在全世界各地发生广泛的影响。它们是推进日益高涨的工人阶级运动的动力，它们是各国人民的思想养料的源泉，这种源泉无疑地将会把他们引向马克思列宁主义在全世界范围内的胜利；而每一个国家的人民自己会去决定在什么时候、用什么方式实现向未来的巨大的跃进。这就是人类在走向不断进步和幸福的时代、走向人类持久和平的时代所必须要经过的道路。
    当中国进入解放和国家建设的第二个十年的时候，我们充满着信心。我们受到“东风压倒西风”这个总的世界形势的鼓舞。
    和平正在战胜战争。民族独立正在战胜帝国主义的束缚。社会主义正在战胜资本主义。我们站在人类向未来进军的前列，对这一点我们感到很自豪。我们重申我们在十年前已经作过的保证：我们将为伟大的共产主义理想而奋斗，直到再没有人剥削人的现象、再没有贫困、再没有民族压迫、再没有战争为止。
