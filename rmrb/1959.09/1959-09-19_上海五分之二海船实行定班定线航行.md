Xinhua News Agency, Qinhuangdao, September 18th. The advanced experience of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau in implementing scheduled and fixed-route navigation for ships to improve transportation efficiency, as introduced by its representatives at the National Road-Port Collaboration On-Site Meeting held in Qinhuangdao, has received great attention from the attending representatives.

The Shanghai Maritime Bureau has a large number of ships traveling between ports such as Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, Dalian, Lianyungang, Yantai, and Shanghai every year. In terms of tonnage, 40% of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau's ships have now implemented scheduled and fixed-route navigation. The scheduled and fixed-route ships sailing on the Shanghai-Qinhuangdao line have fixed schedules and port berths, and are closely connected with the Red Flag trains from Fuxin and other places to Qinhuangdao, shortening voyage times and accelerating material turnover. The Shanghai Maritime Bureau's "Peace No. 54" and "Peace No. 1" ten-thousand-ton giant ships, after implementing scheduled and fixed-route navigation in May, shortened the average voyage time by eight to nine hours compared to April.

Scheduled and fixed-route navigation for ships means determining a batch of ships to sail on a certain route according to a schedule. It is an important link in the "one-stop" transportation collaboration. After the Shanghai Maritime Bureau did this, the consigning departments were able to grasp the departure time and concentrate cargo according to the schedule, which they were very satisfied with. At the same time, the connection between trains and ships is close, the port loading and unloading plan is also implemented, and the equipment is fully utilized.

    上海五分之二海船实行定班定线航行
    新华社秦皇岛18日电　在秦皇岛召开的全国路港协作现场会议上，上海海运局的代表介绍的开展船舶定班定线航行、提高运输效率的先进经验，受到了到会代表的重视。
    上海海运局每年都有大量的船舶往来秦皇岛、青岛、大连、连云港、烟台、上海等港口。按吨位计算，现在上海海运局已经有40％的船舶实行了定班定线航行。航行在上海秦皇岛线上的定班定线船舶，有了固定的班期、港口泊位，同阜新等地去秦皇岛的红旗列车紧密衔接，缩短了航次时间，加速了物资周转。上海海运局和平五十四号、和平一号万吨巨轮，5月份实行定班定线以后，平均航次时间比4月份缩短了八至九小时。
    船舶定班定线，就是确定一批船舶，在一定的航线上，根据班期航行。它是“一条龙”运输协作中的重要一环。上海海运局这样做以后，托运部门能够掌握开船时间，按班期集中货载，十分满意。同时，车船衔接紧密，港湾装卸计划也落实，设备得到充分利用。
