Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, September 7th: The Baotou Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 blast furnace began baking at 1:00 AM today.

　　Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace is one of China's large-scale automated blast furnaces. The effective volume of the furnace body is 1,513 cubic meters, and the designed annual output is 900,000 tons. It adopts new technologies such as high-pressure furnace top, steam blast, and carbon brick furnace bottom, and the entire production process is electrically automated. The project was extremely arduous and complex. The total weight of all steel components and mechanical equipment of the blast furnace is more than 10,000 tons. The furnace body is lined with more than 200 layers of high-quality refractory materials, with a total weight of more than 3,000 tons. The heaviest carbon brick weighs 900 kilograms each, and the bricklaying technology is extremely strict, but the total time for building the furnace body was only 28 days. When installing the furnace top equipment, the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were announced. The workers enthusiastically responded to the Party's call with practical actions to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day. The 200-ton furnace top equipment, which was originally planned to be installed in eleven days, was installed in only six days.

　　Currently, tens of thousands of builders are rushing to adjust various equipment related to iron tapping, striving for the early iron tapping of No. 1 blast furnace.

    包钢一号高炉烘炉
    据新华社包头7日电　包头钢铁公司一号高炉今天凌晨一时开始烘炉。
    包钢一号高炉是我国大型自动化高炉之一。炉体有效容积为一千五百一十三立方米，设计年产量为九十万吨。它采用高压炉顶、蒸汽鼓风、炭砖炉底等新技术，生产过程全部是电气自动化的。工程异常艰巨复杂。高炉的全部钢铁构件和机械设备重达一万多吨。炉体内共砌有二百多层、总重量达三千多吨的优质耐火材料，最重的炭砖每块有九百公斤，砌砖技术要求非常严格，但是砌筑炉体的时间总共只用了二十八天。安装炉顶设备时，党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布了，职工们热烈地以实际行动响应党的号召，迎接国庆十周年，原计划十一天才能安完的二百多吨炉顶设备，只用了六天就安装完了。
    目前，上万名建设者正在突击调整与出铁有关的各项设备，争取一号高炉早日出铁。
