    Before and After Appraisal
    By our reporter Zhou Yongkang
    In March of this year, the news that the Ministry of Chemical Industry was going to hold a meeting in Shanghai for a comprehensive technical appraisal of reactive dyes nationwide caused the workers of several reactive dye factories in Shanghai to become busy once again. From the spring of last year, when the first batch of domestically produced reactive dyes was trial-produced in Shanghai, to the spring of this year, exactly one year has passed. After this year of continuous improvement, in which aspects has this high-grade dye, which is catching up with British products, reached the level of British goods, and in which aspects is it still not good enough? This time, the real ability will be tested.
    The Shanghai Organic Chemical Industry Company decided to conduct a comprehensive analysis and test of the reactive dyes produced in Shanghai before the meeting was held, in order to provide specific data at the national appraisal meeting.
    A reactive dye testing team was organized. The team consisted of twenty people, including engineers and technicians from the Chemical Industry Company and its six dye factories, as well as representatives from the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Purchasing and Supply Station, the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Industry Company, and other units. They classified the batches of reactive dyes sent by various factories in Shanghai according to different varieties, and then found many similar products from imported foreign reactive dyes that could be compared with the domestic dyes, including reactive yellow, reactive brilliant red, reactive orange, and so on. One color against one color, one brand against one brand, and thus began this very complex, meticulous, and very interesting comparative experiment.
    The laboratory was surrounded by various testing instruments, each of which could measure a certain performance of the dye. The most interesting and also the most concerning was the test of whether the dye would fade or not. In the corner of the room was a tall exposure machine, which is an instrument that uses artificial light instead of sunlight to measure the lightfastness of dyes. The test began. Technicians used several kinds of domestic reactive dyes and British reactive dyes to dye color cloths of different colors, and then cut the color cloths into strips and hung them on the rack in the exposure machine. Close the cover, turn on the power, and through the red and blue filter glass, you can see the carbon rod in the middle of the machine emitting a strong and dazzling light. The rack hanging the cloth strips rotates around the carbon rod like a carousel, so that the surrounding cloth strips are evenly exposed to the light. After eighty hours of artificial exposure, take it out and take a look. The areas of the cloth strips dyed with Chinese dyes and British dyes that were "exposed" have only faded a little. The test results showed that the lightfastness of British Reactive Yellow (RS) reached level 6, and the domestic Reactive Yellow (RN) also reached level 6; the lightfastness of other reactive dyes was also between level 4 and level 5.
    Whether the dye fastness is good or not also depends on the situation of soap washing resistance and friction resistance. Next to the exposure machine is a soap washing machine made of stainless steel. Before the test, they put the cloth pieces dyed with domestic dyes and British dyes into glass bottles that were slightly larger than half-pound milk bottles, and added 0.5 cm of soap and 0.1 cm of soda ash to each bottle. After the soap and alkali were added, the bottle mouth was sealed, and the bottles were clamped on the steel frame of the soap washing machine. As soon as the machine was turned on, these bottles tumbled in the high temperature of 95 degrees Celsius. After half an hour, the color of the color cloth washed off by the soap and alkali was exactly the same for the domestic and British dyes, and the soap washing fastness was maintained between level 4 and level 5. The instrument for measuring friction fastness looked very simple, but the measuring method was very interesting. The testers placed the cloth dyed with reactive dyes flat on a piece of felt, and a circular grinding head wrapped in snow-white cloth, plus a weight of one kilogram, was pressed on the color cloth and rubbed back and forth ten times. As a result, after this grinding, the British Reactive Yellow (RS) stained a lot of color on the white cloth, and the friction fastness was only level 3; the domestic Reactive Yellow (RN) stained less on the white cloth, and the fastness reached level 3 to 4.
    The entire test lasted more than a month. The test results showed that the fastness of the five most used reactive dyes in printing and dyeing factories in terms of sunlight, soap washing, perspiration, friction, and acid and alkali treatment were the same as foreign products, and some were even higher than theirs.
    In mid-April, the National Reactive Dye Technology Appraisal Meeting of the Ministry of Chemical Industry was held in Shanghai. Before the meeting, some dye factory cadres in Shanghai believed that it was already good that Shanghai's reactive dyes could reach this level within a year. However, this meeting was not satisfied with this. After affirming the achievements made in the past year, it put forward two higher requirements: one was that the reactive dyes produced in various places should not only catch up with the level of British goods in terms of wearing fastness quality, but also catch up with the advanced level of foreign countries in terms of absorption rate, fixation rate, and solubility; the other requirement was to actively expand the new varieties of reactive dyes, and all the basic colors commonly used in printing and dyeing factories should be fully equipped in the shortest time.
    As soon as the meeting ended, several factories in Shanghai that produced reactive dyes held conferences one after another, determined to continue to make great leaps forward. After the leaders of the Runhua Dye Factory, which first made reactive dyes last year, told the workers about the meeting requirements, some people felt that they were not very confident, but the vast majority of workers believed: "Last year, we broke superstitions, overcame difficulties, and made reactive dyes from scratch; this year, with the foundation of last year, plus the factory has been newly expanded, and the cooperation in all aspects has been strengthened compared to the past, what are we afraid of that we cannot make another great leap forward in quality this year!" They sorted the several main varieties and found that the farthest from British goods in terms of absorption rate, fixation rate, and solubility was Reactive Brilliant Red (3B). In the last test, the British Reactive Brilliant Red (5BS) dye, dissolved in water, and cotton yarn put in, 46% of the dye would drill into the inside of the cotton yarn and combine with the fiber, while the Reactive Brilliant Red produced by this factory only dyed 25% at the same temperature, and the fixation rate differed by nearly half. This means that if the dye from this factory is used to dye cloth, even if the fastness is very high after dyeing, the dye used will be twice as much as the British goods when dyeing, which will affect the production cost of the printing and dyeing factory. In terms of solubility, British dyes are also higher than domestic dyes. Based on this situation, the workers decided to take this variety "under the knife" first, to find the root cause and gain experience.
    The technicians were divided into three shifts, day and night, and divided the conditions such as temperature, concentration, and ratio into more than thirty topics for more than one hundred different tests, and then combined the results of these tests, learned from each other's strengths and made up for each other's weaknesses, and finally found a different process route from the past.
    What about the quality of the Reactive Brilliant Red (3B) manufactured using this new process route?
    They sent a batch of new dyes to the Shanghai Organic Chemical Company Laboratory. The laboratory technicians still used the same method as last time to do the test, and the performance of the dye was beyond the expectations of many people. They used 0.3 cm of dye dissolved in water, put in 10 cm of cotton yarn, and after alkali treatment, took the cotton yarn away, and the remaining dye liquid in the wash water was calculated on a photoelectric colorimeter, only 0.12 cm, about 60% of the dye was dyed on the cotton yarn, and the fixation rate was about 14% higher than British goods. The solubility, starting from 0.5 cm, increased by 1 cm and 1 cm, all the way to 8 cm, and there was no precipitate in the solution at all, and the dye was completely dissolved. In the past, the solubility of British goods was four times higher than ours, but now domestic dyes are three times higher than them.
    After the gap in Reactive Brilliant Red was opened, Reactive Light Yellow (H5G) and Reactive Brilliant Blue (AR) also caught up one after another, and the quality fully caught up with the level of British goods.
    This variety of Reactive Brilliant Blue was trial-produced by four factories in Shanghai last year, but it was not completely successful; some were successfully researched, but the production quantity was very small. The main reason is that there are many difficulties in technology and equipment for manufacturing this dye intermediate. However, without this basic variety of Reactive Brilliant Blue, domestic reactive dyes cannot be fully equipped, and no matter how high the quality of other dyes is, they can only print monochrome cloth and cannot print multi-color printed cloth. This National Appraisal Meeting also specifically mentioned the need to expand this variety. After the meeting, Runhua Dye Factory decided to self-manufacture this intermediate of Reactive Brilliant Blue. However, to make intermediates, there must be many highly efficient vacuum pumps and mixers, which the factory did not have, and could not be purchased for a while. There were only two paths in front of them: one was to wait for the equipment, and start when everything was ready; the other was to make an idea on the original equipment. Runhua Factory took the latter path. The factory had a set of recovery equipment for basic rose essence dyes that was temporarily not in use, which was favored by workers and technicians. This set of equipment is very complete, but to use it to manufacture intermediates for Reactive Brilliant Blue, many places still do not meet the requirements. For example, in the process of manufacturing intermediates, a solvent must be extracted, which requires a high-vacuum pump, but the factory only has an ordinary vacuum pump; if the method of passing water vapor to evaporate the solvent is used, the steam of the entire factory is not enough for this working section. Engineer Tan Mansheng, technician Xi Xiangyun, Dai Ankang and the workers worked together to find a win-win solution. They changed to an easy-to-distill solvent on the one hand, and used an ordinary vacuum pump to extract 70% of the solvent from the solution first, and then distilled with steam, which could reduce the steam consumption by two-thirds. With the efforts of the workers, Reactive Brilliant Blue—this "blank spot" that was considered the most difficult to eliminate—was finally eliminated. These days, they are making preparations for batch formal production, and Reactive Brilliant Blue can be supplied to printing and dyeing factories before National Day.
    It has been less than half a year since the meeting, and the manufacturing technology of Shanghai reactive dyes has taken a big step forward on a new starting point.

    鉴定前后
    本报记者　周永康
    今年3月间，化学工业部要到上海开会，对全国的活性染料做全面技术鉴定的消息一传到上海，几家活性染料厂的职工又一次地忙碌起来。自从去年春天上海试制出第一批国产活性染料，到今年春天，时间恰好一年。经过这一年来的不断改进，这种追赶英国的高级染料，究竟在哪些方面已经达到英国货的水平，哪些方面还不够好？这次就要看真本领了。
    上海市有机化学工业公司决定在会议召开以前，先把上海生产的活性染料作一次全面的分析试验，好在全国鉴定会议上提供具体的资料。
    一个活性染料试验小组组织起来了。小组一共有二十个人，其中有化学工业公司和所属六个染料厂的工程师、技术人员，上海市化工原料采购供应站、上海市印染工业公司等单位的代表。他们把上海各厂送来的一批批活性染料，按不同的品种分类，然后再从进口的外国活性染料中找到许多可同国产染料相比的同类产品，其中有活性黄、活性艳红、活性橙等多种。一种颜色对一种颜色，一种牌号对一种牌号，就这样开始了这次非常复杂细致又非常有趣的对比试验。
    试验室四周摆着各种不同的试验仪器，每一种仪器可以测出染料的一种性能。最有趣的也是人们最关心的，要算染料掉不掉色的试验了。屋角里有一台高大的暴晒机，它是一种用人造光代替太阳光来测定染料日晒牢度的仪器。测定开始了。技术人员们用几种国产活性染料和英国活性染料分别染成不同颜色的色布，再把色布裁成布条，挂在暴晒机里的架子上。关上罩，一开电门，透过红色蓝色的滤色玻璃，只见机器当中的炭精棒发出强烈耀眼的亮光。挂着布条的架子像走马灯似地围着炭精棒转，让四周布条受光均匀。经过八十小时的人工暴晒，拿出来一看，中国染料和英国染料染的布条，被“晒”到的地方都只退掉一点点颜色。测定的结果，英国活性黄（RS）的日晒牢度达到六级，国产的活性黄（RN）也达到六级；其他几种活性染料的日晒牢度，也都一样在四级到五级之间。
    染料牢度好不好，还要看耐皂洗、耐摩擦的情况。在暴晒机旁边就是一台用不锈钢做的皂洗机。测定以前，他们把国产染料和英国染料染的布块，分别放在比半磅牛奶瓶大一些的玻璃瓶里，每个瓶都加进零点五公分的肥皂和零点一公分的纯碱。皂碱放好，瓶口密闭，瓶子夹在皂洗机的钢架上，机器一开动，这些瓶子就在摄氏九十五度的高温里翻腾着，过了半个钟头，色布被皂碱洗掉的颜色，国产的和英国的染料也完全一样，皂洗牢度都保持在四级和五级之间。测定摩擦牢度的仪器看上去非常简单，测定的方法却很有趣。试验人员把染着活性染料的布，平整地放在一块绒毡上，上面一个圆形的磨头用雪白的布包起来，加上一公斤的重量，压在色布上来回摩擦十次。结果，英国活性黄（RS），经这一磨，白布上沾了不少颜色，摩擦牢度只有三级；国产活性黄（RN），沾到白布上的较少，牢度达到三至四级。
    测定全部结束，时间花了一个多月。测定结果，五个印染厂用得最多的活性染料，在日晒、皂洗、汗渍、摩擦、酸碱处理等方面的牢度，都和国外产品一样，有的比他们的还高。
    4月中旬，化学工业部的全国活性染料技术鉴定会议在上海召开了。开会以前，上海有的染料厂的干部认为，上海的活性染料在一年之内能够达到这样的水平，已经不错了。这个会议却不以此为满足，在肯定一年来所取得的成就以后，又提出了两个更高的要求：一个是要求各地生产的活性染料，不但在穿着牢度质量方面赶上英国货的水平，还要在吸色率、固色率、溶解度这些方面赶上国外的先进水平；另一个要求是积极扩大活性染料的新品种，凡是印染厂常用的几种基本颜色，都要在最短的时间内配齐成套。
    会议一结束，上海几家生产活性染料的工厂纷纷召开大会，下决心继续跃进。去年第一个制成活性染料的润华染料厂，当领导方面把会议要求告诉工人以后，有的人感到把握不大，但是绝大多数职工认为：“去年打破迷信，克服困难，从无到有地制成了活性染料；今年有了去年这个基础，加上工厂新扩建了，各方面的协作比过去加强了，还怕今年不能在质量方面再来个大跃进！”他们把几种主要品种排了排队，发现在吸色率、固色率、溶解度等方面同英国货差得最远的是活性艳红（3B）。在上次测定时，英国活性艳红（5BS）染料，化在水里，棉纱放进去，有46％的染料会钻到棉纱内部同纤维结合起来，而这个厂生产的活性艳红，在同样温度下，只染上去25％，固色率相差将近一半。这就是说，如果用这个厂的染料染布，即使染上去以后牢度很高，但在染的时候，用的染料要比英国货多一倍，这会影响印染厂的生产成本。在溶解度方面，英国产的染料也比国产染料高。根据这一情况，职工们决定先拿这个品种“开刀”，来找病根，摸经验。
    技术人员们分成日夜三班，把温度、浓度、配比等条件分成三十多个专题作了一百多次不同的试验，然后把这些试验的结果综合起来，互相取长补短，最后找到了一种和过去不同的工艺路线。
    用这条新工艺路线制造的活性艳红（3B），质量怎么样呢？
    他们给上海有机化学公司试验室送去了一批新染料。试验室技术人员仍旧用上次同样的方法做试验，染料性能之好，出乎许多人的意料。他们用零点三公分的染料化在水里，把十公分的棉纱放进去，经过加碱处理，把棉纱拿走，留在脚水里的染料余液放在光电比色计上一算，只有零点一二公分，约60％的染料都染到棉纱上去了，固色率比英国货还高出约14％。溶解度，从零点五公分开始，一公分一公分地增加，一直加到八公分，溶液里一点沉淀也没有，染料全部溶化。过去英国货的溶解度比我们的高出四倍，现在国产染料反比他们高出了三倍。
    活性艳红这个缺口打开以后，活性嫩黄（H5G）、活性艳蓝（AR）也都纷纷赶上来，质量全面赶上了英国货的水平。
    活性艳蓝这个品种，去年上海有四个工厂试制过，可是没有完全成功；有的研究成功了，生产数量很少。主要原因是制造这种染料的中间体，在技术上、设备上有许多困难。但是，没有活性艳蓝这个基本品种，国产活性染料就配不成套，别的染料质量再高，也只能印些单色布，不能印套色花布。这次全国鉴定会议上也特别提到要扩大这个品种。会后，润华染料厂决定自制这种活性艳蓝的中间体。可是要做中间体，要有许多效率很高的真空泵、搅拌机，厂里都没有，一时也购置不到。摆在他们面前，只有两条路：一条是坐等设备，哪一天齐了哪一天动手；一条是在原有设备上打主意。润华厂走的是后一条路。厂里有一套暂时不用的盐基玫瑰精染料的回收设备，被工人和技术人员们看中了。这套设备很完整，但是要用来制造活性艳蓝的中间体，有许多地方还达不到要求。例如，在制造中间体过程中，要把一种溶剂抽出来，就要用高度真空泵，而厂里只有一台普通真空泵；如果用通水蒸汽的办法把溶剂蒸出来，全厂的蒸汽光给这个工段还不够。工程师谈满生、技术员奚翔云、戴安康和工人们一起动脑筋，找到了一个两全其美的办法。他们一面改用了一种容易蒸馏的溶剂，一面用普通真空泵先把溶液里70％的溶剂抽出来，然后再通蒸汽蒸馏，蒸汽用量就可以减少三分之二。在职工们的努力下，活性艳蓝——这个被认为最难消灭的“空白点”，终于被消灭了。这几天，他们正在作成批正式生产的准备工作，国庆以前，活性艳蓝就可以供应印染厂的需要了。
    从开会到现在，时间还不到半年，而上海活性染料的制造技术，又在新的起点上前进了一大步。
