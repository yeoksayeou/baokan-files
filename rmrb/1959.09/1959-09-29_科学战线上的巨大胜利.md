Great Victory on the Science Front
Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

We celebrate the great festival of the Chinese people—the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—with the greatest joy and excitement!

In these ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have victoriously carried out one revolutionary struggle after another, and have achieved brilliant historical achievements on the road of building socialism.

On the science front, great victories have also been achieved in the past ten years, and rich experiences have been created. These ten years have been a decade of high-speed development of China's scientific undertaking; a decade of repeated struggles between the socialist road and the capitalist road in scientific work, and continuous victories; a decade of development of Marxist academic research in combat.

I

Ten years ago, the natural science foundation we inherited from the old China was very weak: the number of scientific personnel was very small, the scientific disciplines were incomplete, the scientific departments closely related to production and emerging science departments were almost completely blank, and most of the research work was divorced from Chinese reality. This was the result of the heavy oppression and shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which prevented modern natural science from developing smoothly in our country. Under the reactionary rule, although many scientists wanted to contribute their efforts to the prosperity of the motherland, their efforts were not encouraged and supported. In terms of philosophy and social sciences, progressive doctrines and ideologies were even more devastated and oppressed by the reactionary rulers. However, with the continuous victory of the people's revolution, Marxism has been widely spread and greatly developed in our country. Of course, it was only after the working people gained national power that it was possible to conduct systematic research using the Marxist viewpoint on a large scale in all academic fields. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to build a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, it was necessary to catch up in natural science as soon as possible and reach the world's most advanced level. The task of philosophy and social sciences was to thoroughly criticize bourgeois academic thoughts, vigorously carry out research work, and enable Marxism to occupy all academic fields to meet the needs of socialist revolution and construction.

Over the past ten years, the development of science in our country has gone through such a process: In the first few years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the main tasks were to take over and adjust the existing scientific institutions; rectify and develop higher education to train scientific cadres; organize the study of Marxism-Leninism and carry out ideological transformation in the scientific team; and begin to carry out scientific research work in combination with national needs. In this way, the scientific undertaking has been initially developed. In 1956, when the socialist transformation of the national economy was basically completed and socialist construction was accelerated, the need for scientific development became more urgent. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over scientific and cultural work and fully mobilize the strength of intellectuals to serve socialist construction, the Party Central Committee convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals. At the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the great call to strive to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level quickly. This call was enthusiastically responded to by the scientific community in our country. Under the auspices of the National Science Planning Committee, a long-term plan for the development of science and technology for twelve years was formulated. At the same time, in order to develop Marxist academic research, a long-term plan for the development of philosophy and social sciences for twelve years was also formulated. In just over a year, a situation of rapid development appeared in China's scientific undertaking. In 1958, on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of the Party Central Committee of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, a high tide of the Great Leap Forward was also set off on the science front, and the development of the scientific undertaking achieved an even higher speed.

After ten years of development, especially the Great Leap Forward since last year, the face of scientific work in our country is very different from that at the beginning of liberation. Ten years ago, we established the Chinese Academy of Sciences on the basis of the old Academia Sinica and the Peiping Research Institute. At that time, there were only twenty-two research institutions under its jurisdiction and only two hundred and twenty-four researchers. Today, ten years later, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed into a scientific center with nearly one hundred directly affiliated research institutions and nearly seven thousand researchers. The scientific research institutions under the various departments of the government have been universally established since the formulation of the plan in 1956. Now there are the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and a series of other research institutions in natural sciences and social sciences. Last year, the local scientific undertaking made great progress. The branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in various provinces (municipalities, autonomous regions) have increased from the original four to twenty-six (including those already established and those under preparation). Scientific organizations in special regions, counties, communes, factories, and mines are being universally developed. The scientific research work of colleges and universities has also been greatly developed. A national scientific research institution network has now taken shape. The number of professional scientific research teams nationwide has increased by about fifty times compared with the early days of liberation.

Over the past ten years, the face of natural science research work has undergone fundamental changes. Many departments that were originally blank have been established, and many departments that were originally very weak have also been strengthened. Research work has been closely integrated with national needs. The scale of investigation, survey, and research on China's natural resources and natural conditions is fundamentally unimaginable in the old China. Important scientific work such as the research and design of large-scale water conservancy projects, large-scale construction projects, the research and design of various precision, large-scale, and complex mechanical structures, and the highly comprehensive utilization of various complex ores, which the scientific community could not do in the past, and even dared not think about, can now not only be done, but also have achieved good results. Emerging cutting-edge science and technology departments, such as atomic energy, semiconductors, and computer technology, have developed from scratch; with the help of the Soviet Union, we have built the largest atomic reactor and cyclotron in Asia. Taking mathematics and botany as examples, the number of papers published in the past ten years is twice and four times the number of papers published in the twenty years before liberation, respectively. This figure shows that the research of basic disciplines has also made great progress.

Over the past ten years, the face of philosophical and social science research work has also undergone fundamental changes. The new force of Marxism has grown in large numbers, the influence of bourgeois ideology in the academic community has been greatly weakened, and many bourgeois scholars have begun to abandon their original positions and gradually turn to Marxism. Professional research teams in philosophy and social sciences and vast non-professional research teams have conducted a lot of research work on various important practical problems raised in China's socialist revolution and construction. This aspect of work occupies a primary position in the entire philosophical and social science research work. In economics, history, ethnology, linguistics, and archeology, planned and systematic accumulation of materials has begun, which is necessary for creative theoretical work. The investigation and research work on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agricultural cooperation, and people's communes has been carried out on a very large scale. The investigation of the social development of ethnic minorities such as the Kawa, Li, Yi, and Tibetan people provides very precious and rich materials for the study of clan society, slave society, and serf society. The work of studying China's history and critically sorting out cultural heritage from the perspective of Marxism has been widely carried out. Throughout the academic community, the atmosphere of criticism and discussion is becoming increasingly active.

Everyone knows about Comrade Mao Zedong's major contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory. In every historical period of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, solved major problems in the Chinese revolution and construction, led the Chinese revolution and construction cause to one victory after another, and enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, it also provided sharp ideological weapons and correct working methods for the research work of the scientific community in our country, guiding the vigorous development of science in our country.

In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and relying on the joint efforts of all scientific workers, China's scientific work has undoubtedly made great achievements.

II

The struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in scientific work and the victory of this struggle are of decisive significance for the development of China's scientific undertaking. The socialist revolution is an extremely profound, broad, and thorough revolution. It must not only be carried out on the economic front, but also on the political and ideological fronts. The struggle between the two roads in scientific work is an important part of the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields.

The struggle between the two roads in scientific work is not only inevitable but also quite fierce. The scientific community in our country is a place where senior intellectuals gather, most of whom are bourgeois intellectuals. They have some useful knowledge. It is necessary for the working class to win over and unite them to serve socialist construction. Although most of these bourgeois scientists have patriotic feelings and sympathize with and support the democratic revolution, many people adopt a reserved attitude towards the socialist revolution, and some even adopt an opposing attitude because they are permeated with the bourgeois worldview and habits. Bourgeois scientists have nostalgia and illusions about capitalism. Many of them are not convinced by the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party, and are not enthusiastic about serving socialism. Not only that, but they always want to transform the cause of the people according to their bourgeois views. If their bourgeois thoughts are not changed, they will inevitably conflict with the proletariat.

In order to help bourgeois scientists carry out ideological transformation, the Party has carried out a series of work, including the ideological transformation movement of intellectuals in 1952 and the movement to criticize bourgeois academic thoughts represented by Hu Shi from 1954 to 1955. Through these ideological criticisms, coupled with the practice of participating in various revolutionary mass movements, the practice of scientific work, and the study of Marxism-Leninism, many scientists gradually increased their understanding of the people's revolution and socialism. However, the process of ideological transformation is the transformation of class stand and worldview. It cannot be expected that the problem can be completely solved in a short period of time through one or two movements. Ideological struggles will always be carried out repeatedly, and under certain conditions, they will also intensify.

Things turned out to be so. In the spring of 1957, the domestic bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack against the Party and socialism. A small group of rightists in the scientific community openly put forward an anti-socialist scientific program, and a sharp struggle was provoked by them.

The anti-socialist scientific program of the rightists and their remarks at that time mainly focused on the following issues: (1) Opposing the Party's leadership over scientific work, saying that "laymen cannot lead experts," and touting so-called "scientific freedom"; (2) Opposing scientific work serving socialist construction, opposing the fundamental Marxist principle of combining theory with practice, and opposing the planned scientific work according to national needs, saying that "science cannot be planned at all," and "scientific work cannot have the slightest utilitarian consideration," and touting so-called "science for science"; (3) Opposing the leading position of Marxism in our country, and demanding the restoration of bourgeois sociology, economics, history, and idealist philosophy. The purpose of the rightists in the scientific community is very clear, that is, to usurp the Party's leadership over scientific work, transform China's scientific undertaking according to the capitalist road, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism with bourgeois social sciences. It is very obvious that the attack of the rightists on the scientific front is an important aspect of their overall attack against the Party and socialism. This is a manifestation of the intensification of the struggle between the two roads on the scientific front.

Under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of scientific workers and the people of the whole country exposed and smashed the conspiracy of the rightists and thoroughly criticized the anti-socialist scientific program. Those who were once confused in the rightist attack also quickly turned to the anti-rightist position. Through this struggle, the rightists were completely isolated, the vast number of scientific workers received a profound education, further improved their political understanding, and moved closer to the Party and the people.

On the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, the scientific community continued to launch a great debate on the two roads of scientific work in the rectification movement. This great debate enabled the vast number of scientific workers to further understand that in scientific work, it is necessary to adhere to the Party's leadership, science must serve socialist construction, and the interrelationships between theory and practice, individual and collective, expert and mass, and red and expert must be correctly handled. This debate belongs to the scope of contradictions among the people and is carried out in accordance with the principle of "unity-criticism-unity."

After the anti-rightist and rectification movements, the vast number of scientific workers have changed their original political attitudes and ideological conditions to varying degrees. Most people have begun to realize some of their erroneous views on the issue of socialist revolution and the issue of the two roads of scientific work, and expressed their determination to transform themselves and strive to become red experts needed by the people. In this way, the necessary conditions have been prepared for implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction and realizing the Great Leap Forward in scientific work.

The struggle between the two roads in scientific work has now achieved a decisive victory. But this does not mean the final end of the struggle. Our experience in the past ten years has proved that in the scientific field, as in other ideological and cultural fields, the socialist revolution must be carried through to the end. Otherwise, the smooth development of the socialist scientific undertaking is impossible. The Party's leadership over scientific work must continue to be consolidated and strengthened. The work of building a strong team of scientific workers who are loyal to the working class and the socialist cause must be stepped up. Our scientific workers should not be satisfied with the existing progress, but must continue to move forward, unremittingly carry out self-ideological transformation, and strive to thoroughly transform themselves into scientific workers of the working class.

III

According to the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party adopted the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Once the thought of the general line penetrated into the masses, it immediately set off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of construction. Under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the scientific undertaking also entered a period of leap-forward development. Not only in scientific institutions and colleges and universities, but also in factories, mines, and the vast rural areas, people could be seen everywhere, spirited, high-spirited, and high-spirited, marching towards the fortress of science, and achieving great achievements.

Fast speed and large scale are the characteristics of scientific work in the Great Leap Forward. For example, the geological survey of rare elements in the past year far exceeded the original Second Five-Year Plan; the analysis and separation of rare earth elements quickly reached the world's advanced level. Some newly established scientific departments have made particularly rapid progress. For example, the research on semiconductors quickly mastered the technology of material purification and trial-produced high-frequency and high-power electronic devices. An electronic computer with 10,000 calculations per second was also manufactured during this period. These all greatly exceeded the original requirements of the Twelve-Year Plan.

Some large-scale work has always been delayed due to insufficient manpower. Since the Great Leap Forward, due to the mobilization of the broad masses and the combination of experts and the masses, this type of work has been smoothly carried out. In just over half a year, nineteen provinces completed soil surveys; the survey of wild plants, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, etc., also achieved unprecedented achievements with unprecedented scale and unprecedented speed. On the scattered experimental fields of the people's communes, extensive scientific observations and research were conducted on how to implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" in agricultural production, and the experience of agricultural bumper harvests was summarized, which is of great significance for the development of China's agricultural science. In the Great Steelmaking Movement, 90 million people across the country went to the mountains to find minerals, which played a significant role in clarifying China's coal and iron resources. In the past, scholars believed that there would be no large iron mines in the Qinling area. Geologists spent a long time without finding a deposit. In the winter of 1958, as soon as the masses went to the mountains, a large iron mine was discovered. Due to the mass movement of finding and reporting mines, the new proven iron ore reserves in the country in 1958 were equal to 76% of all the reserves proven in the past.

In the Great Leap Forward, in terms of philosophy and social sciences, mass research work has also been greatly developed and achieved remarkable results.

It is impossible to list the achievements of the Great Leap Forward here. In short, the achievements of the past two years have greatly surpassed those of the past many years. This is the victory of the Party's general line and the victory of the Party's mass line. What is the mass line in the scientific undertaking? According to existing experience, it mainly includes: mobilizing the people to participate in the technical revolution and cultural revolution throughout the country, combining the work of scientific institutions with the scientific activities of the broad masses, combining improvement and popularization, and adopting the policy of simultaneously developing central and local scientific undertakings; within scientific institutions, it is necessary to fully exert the creativity and initiative of all scientific workers, especially young people, and combine the vigor of young people with the role of older scientists. To achieve all this, it is necessary to implement political leadership, break superstitions, liberate the mind, and launch a mass movement on the science front.

Science, in the final analysis, comes from practice and serves practice. The production practice and revolutionary practice of millions of working people are the source of scientific development. The continuous creation and development of science are completed with the direct and indirect participation of the masses. Science, once divorced from the masses, becomes water without a source and a tree without roots. Conversely, the closer science is to the masses, the faster it develops.

Our country is a large country with a population of over 600 million, but it is poor and blank, and its science is backward. The people are eagerly demanding to realize the technical revolution and cultural revolution and get rid of this backward state. On the science front, if we ignore the demands of the masses and do not rely on the initiative and creative spirit of the masses, and only rely on specialized scientific institutions and a few experts to carry out work, it will never be possible to develop work quickly, well, and economically, and it will inevitably lag behind the needs of the development of the objective situation, and it will inevitably make right-leaning conservative errors. The Party's general line of socialist construction illuminates us, enabling us to avoid this error, adhere to the mass line policy, and achieve remarkable results in practical work. The endless examples in the Great Leap Forward prove that the creativity of the masses is endless. For example, an ordinary observer of a meteorological station in Zhenxiong, Yunnan, and farmers summarized the long-term experience of the masses in observing the weather and created a set of supplementary weather forecast methods for a single station; after this method was promoted throughout the country, the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts in our country increased by about 10% compared with 1957. This is just one of the countless vivid examples in the mass technical innovation movement. From here, it is not difficult to see the working people's ardent desire to learn science, and it is not difficult to see their creative talents in science. Although their inventions and creations generally do not have a systematic theoretical form, there are many insights that some well-learned scholars do not have. We must help them learn and advance with full enthusiasm, and regard their inventions and creations as the wealth of science, and raise them to a systematic theoretical level; we must never despise or exclude them with a bourgeois master-like attitude.

Natural science work must rely on the masses, and philosophical and social science work must also rely on the masses. Without going deep into the masses, without closely contacting the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and without combining the work of professional teams and non-professional teams, the sound development of philosophy and social sciences is unimaginable.

We emphasize mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses, but we do not underestimate the role of specialized scientific institutions at all. On the contrary, our policy is to combine the labor and creation of the broad masses with the work of specialized scientific institutions. The more widespread the mass technical revolution and cultural revolution, the more urgent the requirements for specialized scientific institutions. Because specialized scientific institutions can become the center for improving the inventions and creations of the masses and popularizing scientific knowledge to the masses. There are too few such scientific institutions now. In order to meet the needs of the country, according to the policy of simultaneous development of central and local levels, various scientific institutions and scientific organizations have been established in large numbers from provinces and cities to factories and mines and people's communes since last year. In this way, a scientific network combining advanced, intermediate, and elementary scientific research institutions has emerged. With this scientific network, the technical revolution and cultural revolution of the masses can be carried out more powerfully, so that China's science can be improved on the basis of popularization, and popularized under the guidance of improvement.

Not only in the relationship between experts and working people does the question of whether or not to rely on the masses exist, but also within specialized scientific institutions and teams does the question of whether or not to rely on the masses exist. In the latter case, the focus of the issue is how to give full play to the creativity and initiative of young scientific personnel. Young people are not only the future of science and our successors, but also an important force in current scientific research work. Generally speaking, young people are not yet mature in science, and it is only natural that they need to study diligently and earnestly and humbly ask their predecessors for advice. But their revolutionary enthusiasm, their creative talents, their sensitivity to new things, and their spirit of persisting in the truth and forging ahead courageously are very valuable. Our older generation of scientists must enthusiastically encourage them, so that they dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act; we must let them do their work and help them overcome such or such difficulties and do their work well; at the same time, we must also put down our airs and learn from their strengths. Older scientists are often calm but lack revolutionary enthusiasm, or even lack it altogether, so they must learn from young people to boost their own enthusiasm and prevent conservatism.

In the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, the older scientists and young people, teachers and students of scientific institutions and colleges and universities across the country, in the spirit of mutual learning, mutual assistance, and unity, and in the spirit of combining revolutionary enthusiasm and seeking truth from facts, actively carried out scientific research work. In just over a year, many research projects have been completed, a large part of which were done by young people. It has been less than two years since the start of the Great Leap Forward. During this period, although some research work has not been done perfectly, or even very imperfectly, people have been able to clearly see the power of the mass line in the scientific undertaking from the great achievements we have achieved. Implementing the mass line in scientific work is the fundamental guarantee for the high-speed development of China's scientific undertaking. There should be no more doubts about this.

IV

In 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the academic and cultural fields. This is a policy to promote the development of art and the progress of science, and to promote the prosperity of socialist culture in our country. This policy is fully in line with the objective laws of art and science development.

The process of scientific development, the process of people's understanding of objective truth, is a very complex and tortuous process full of contradictions and struggles, and cannot be a simple linear process of increasing correct understanding. When people conduct scientific research, various differences and contradictions in understanding will arise simply due to the differences in the materials they have mastered, the differences in the angle and depth of observation, and the differences in the methods of dealing with problems and exploring solutions. These differences and contradictions are the inevitable products of the development of understanding and are normal phenomena in the field of understanding. The entire history of science proves that the development of understanding is precisely the process of the struggle of these contradictions in understanding that are constantly being resolved and constantly being generated.

It should be said that most of the debates between various doctrines and schools in natural science belong to this type of contradiction in understanding. A considerable part of the debates among Marxist academic workers on different academic viewpoints in philosophy and social sciences also belong to this type of contradiction. For such academic issues of right and wrong, it is obviously necessary to solve them through free discussion in the academic community and through scientific practice, and it is not appropriate to adopt simple methods to solve them. Only by fully unfolding the debate can the development of understanding be promoted, erroneous understanding be gradually overcome to reach correct understanding, one-sided understanding be overcome to reach comprehensive understanding, and superficial understanding be overcome to reach in-depth understanding. Any ideas and practices that hinder free debate in science, such as thinking that the opinions of academic authorities are beyond doubt, or rashly drawing conclusions, forcibly promoting one school of thought, and prohibiting another school of thought, are contrary to the objective law that understanding develops through contradiction and struggle, and will hinder scientific progress, and are therefore incorrect.

Of course, the contradictions between different viewpoints and opinions on academic issues do not all belong to the scope of contradictions in understanding. Under the current conditions in our country, many contradictions in academic viewpoints are related to the contradictions between the standpoints and worldviews of different classes. In our society, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the ideological field will exist for a long time. This struggle, reflected in the academic field, is manifested as the struggle between Marxist academic viewpoints and bourgeois academic viewpoints. This struggle also exists in the theoretical viewpoints of natural science; it will also be reflected in the debates among Marxist academic workers.

For us Marxists, there can be no compromise or reconciliation with bourgeois ideology. It is necessary to launch a resolute struggle, and it is necessary to develop Marxism in all scientific fields and overcome bourgeois academic thought. This is an undoubted matter. The question is only what kind of method should be adopted to truly achieve this goal. Why do we also advocate adopting the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend for bourgeois ideas on academic issues, rather than adopting the policy of prohibiting their publication? Comrade Mao Zedong said very clearly: "Dealing with ideological problems among the people, dealing with problems of the spiritual world, using simple methods will not only be ineffective, but also very harmful. If erroneous opinions are not allowed to be published, the result is that erroneous opinions still exist. And if correct opinions are cultivated in a greenhouse, if they have not seen wind and rain and have not acquired immunity, they will not be able to win battles when they encounter erroneous opinions. Therefore, only by adopting the methods of discussion, criticism, and reasoning can we truly develop correct opinions, overcome erroneous opinions, and truly solve problems."

Of course, the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is the manifestation of freedom among the people in the academic field, which is premised on the socialist political direction. Comrade Mao Zedong put forward six political criteria in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the criteria for distinguishing direction. If someone violates these six political criteria and engages in political activities that undermine socialism and restore capitalism, that is not allowed by the proletarian dictatorship system. Political struggles belonging to the nature of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy are fundamentally different from the contention of a hundred schools of thought debating right and wrong in academic viewpoints, and cannot be confused. But if someone wants to use the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend to carry out anti-socialist activities, there is nothing terrible about it. Letting the poisonous weeds expose their true colors makes it easier for the masses to identify and hoe them out.

The process of implementing the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is the process of each discipline becoming increasingly prosperous.

We have done a lot of work in systematically criticizing bourgeois academic thought in the past. Last year, on the basis of the nationwide rectification movement, the academic community launched a large-scale movement to criticize bourgeois academic thought. This criticism almost involved every academic field and all academic work units. Its outstanding feature is that the vast number of young teachers, young researchers, and students have participated in it. They have been tempered in the struggle, and have vividly conducted a Marxist study and cultivated a fighting style. This criticism is healthy and fruitful. Fighting against bourgeois academic thought and developing the strength of Marxism through this struggle is our long-term task, and we will continue to carry it out in the future on the basis of serious scientific research.

In recent years, many discussions on academic issues have been conducted in the academic fields of philosophy, economics, history, literature, aesthetics, psychology, genetics, geology, etc. In terms of theoretical exploration of practical issues, critical sorting of historical heritage, and research on basic theories of various disciplines, many new problems and new arguments have been put forward. All these discussions are very meaningful, and have played a positive role in overcoming some incorrect opinions, developing and enriching correct opinions, or promoting more in-depth research on these issues. Through academic debates, the growth of the new force of Marxism has been greatly promoted, and at the same time, a new atmosphere of vigorous and lively forward development has emerged in China's academic community.

Actual life in recent years has shown the correctness and vitality of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The longer the time passes, the more clearly the profound influence of this policy on the prosperous development of science in our country will be manifested.

* * * *

The achievements of China's scientific undertaking in the past ten years are great, but they are still far from enough to meet the needs of the rapid development of China's entire socialist construction undertaking. In order to realize the great historical task of the technical revolution and cultural revolution, scientific work must move forward on a larger scale and at a higher speed. This is entirely possible, because we have sufficient superior conditions.

We have a superior socialist system. Under this system, science has gained true liberation, and the high-speed development of production and rich revolutionary practice make the development of science the greatest source and driving force. Under this system, science can be developed in a planned way, we can unite and organize our forces to march towards science, rationally utilize material and technical conditions, maintain the balance between various departments of science, and ensure the most effective utilization of scientific achievements. Under this system, the wisdom, creativity, and initiative of the broad masses can be fully exerted, and the growth rate of scientific talent far exceeds that of capitalism.

We have the internationalist assistance of socialist countries. The tremendous achievements of China's scientific undertaking are inseparable from the tremendous assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Over the past ten years, we have learned from the achievements and experience of advanced Soviet science, and with the help of the Soviet Union, we have completed many major scientific research projects. In 1958, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement on scientific cooperation. Almost all other socialist fraternal countries and our country have cultural cooperation agreements or scientific cooperation agreements. Our cooperation is becoming closer and closer. There is no doubt that we will always help each other and improve together.

We have the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Marxist-Leninist thought. The Party has correctly pointed out the direction of the development of China's scientific undertaking and formulated various policies and policies for scientific work. Along the road guided by the Party, China's scientific undertaking will surely achieve more rapid development on the existing basis.

Our future is infinitely bright. Our scientific workers across the country must resolutely support the leadership of the Party, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, strive to make themselves talents for socialist construction with both redness and expertise, better serve socialist construction, and make the cause of national construction move from great victory to greater victory.

专栏：辉煌的十年

    科学战线上的巨大胜利
    中国科学院院长　郭沫若
  我们以最大的欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝中国人民的伟大节日——中华人民共和国建国十周年！
    在这十年中，中国人民在中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，胜利地进行了一个接一个的革命斗争，在建设社会主义的道路上，取得了辉煌的历史性的成就。
    在科学战线上，十年来也取得了巨大的胜利，创造了丰富的经验。这十年，是我国科学事业高速度发展的十年；是科学工作中社会主义道路同资本主义道路进行反复斗争、不断取得胜利的十年；是马克思主义的学术研究在战斗中发展的十年。

    十年前，我们从旧中国接受过来的自然科学基础是十分薄弱的：科学人员数量很小，科学门类不全，密切结合生产的和新兴的科学部门几乎完全是空白，大多数的研究工作是脱离中国实际的。这是由于在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的重重压迫和束缚下，近代自然科学在我国始终未能得到顺利发展的结果。在反动统治下，虽然有不少科学家很想为祖国的富强贡献自己的力量，但是他们的努力得不到鼓舞和支持。哲学社会科学方面，进步的学说和思潮更是受到反动统治者的摧残和压迫。但是随着人民革命的不断胜利，马克思主义在我国得到了广泛的传播和重大的发展。当然，在所有学术领域中运用马克思主义的观点进行系统的研究，只有到了劳动人民取得全国政权之后，才有可能大规模地进行。中华人民共和国成立后，为了建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，在自然科学方面，必须急起直追，尽快赶上世界最先进的水平。而哲学社会科学方面的任务，则是对资产阶级的学术思想进行彻底的批判，大力开展研究工作，使马克思主义占领所有的学术领域，以适应社会主义革命和建设的需要。
    十年来，我国科学的发展经历了这样的过程：人民共和国成立后的最初几年，主要的工作是，接收旧有的科学机构加以调整；整顿与发展高等教育以培养科学干部；组织学习马克思列宁主义，在科学队伍中进行思想改造；并且开始结合国家需要进行科学研究工作。这样，就使科学事业得到初步的发展。1956年，当国民经济的社会主义改造基本完成、社会主义建设加速进行的时候，对科学发展的需要更加迫切了。为了加强党对科学文化工作的领导，充分动员知识分子的力量为社会主义建设服务，党中央召开了关于知识分子问题的会议，会上毛泽东同志发出了为迅速赶上世界先进科学水平而奋斗的伟大号召。这个号召，得到我国科学界的热烈响应，在国家科学规划委员会主持下，制定了十二年科学技术发展的远景规划。同时，为了发展马克思主义的学术研究，还制定了十二年哲学社会科学发展的远景规划。一年多的时间，在我国科学事业中就出现了快速发展的局面。1958年，在反右派斗争和整风运动胜利的基础上，在党中央提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，科学战线上也掀起了大跃进的高潮，科学事业的发展取得了更高的速度。
    经过十年的发展，特别是去年以来的大跃进，我国科学工作的面貌和解放初期已经大大不同了。十年前，我们在旧中国中央研究院和北平研究院的基础上，建立了中国科学院。当时所辖的研究机构只有二十二个，研究人员只有二百二十四人。而十年后的今天，中国科学院已经发展成为一个拥有近百个直属研究机构，近七千研究人员的科学中心了。政府各部门所属的科学研究机构，在1956年制定规划以后，普遍地建立了起来。现在已经有了医学科学院、农业科学院和其他一系列自然科学和社会科学方面的研究机构。去年地方的科学事业有了很大的发展。中国科学院各省（市、自治区）的分院，由原来的四个增加到二十六个（包括已经建立的和正在筹建中的）。专区、县、公社、厂矿的科学组织正在普遍发展中。高等学校的科学研究工作也有了很大的发展。一个全国的科学研究机构网，现在已经颇具规模了。全国专业的科学研究队伍的人数，比初解放时增加了约五十倍。
    十年来，自然科学研究工作的面貌，发生了根本变化。许多原来是空白的部门建立起来了，许多原来十分薄弱的部门也得到了加强。研究工作同国家需要紧密地结合了起来。对于我国自然资源和自然条件的调查、考察和研究，规模的宏大是在旧中国根本无法设想的。大型的水利工程、大型的建筑工程的研究和设计，各种精密的、大型的、复杂结构的机械的研究和设计，各种复合矿石的高度综合利用等重要的科学工作，过去科学界是不能做，甚至不敢想的，现在不仅能够做，而且做出了很好的成绩。新兴的尖端科学技术部门，如原子能、半导体、计算技术等，从无到有地发展了起来；在苏联帮助下，我们已经建成了亚洲最大的原子反应堆和回旋加速器。以数学和植物学为例，十年来发表的论文篇数，分别为解放前二十多年发表的论文篇数的两倍和四倍，这个数字说明基础学科的研究也有很大的发展。
    十年来，哲学社会科学研究工作的面貌，也发生了根本变化。马克思主义的新生力量已经大批地生长，资产阶级思想在学术界的影响已经大大地削弱，不少资产阶级学者已经开始抛弃原来的立场，逐步转变到马克思主义方面来。哲学社会科学的专业研究队伍和广大的非专业的研究队伍，对我国社会主义革命和建设中提出的各种重要的现实问题，进行了不少的研究工作。这一方面的工作，在整个哲学社会科学研究工作中是居于首要地位的。在经济学、历史学、民族学、语言学和考古学等方面，已经开始了有计划的、系统的积累资料的工作，这是创造性的理论工作所必需的。关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造、农业合作化和人民公社的调查研究工作，都以很宏大的规模进行。关于佧瓦族、黎族、彝族和藏族等少数民族社会发展的调查，为研究氏族社会、奴隶社会、农奴社会提供了十分珍贵而丰富的材料。根据马克思主义观点来研究我国历史和批判地整理文化遗产的工作，已经广泛开展。在整个学术界，批评和讨论的风气日趋活跃。
    毛泽东同志在马克思列宁主义理论方面的重大贡献，大家都是知道的。毛泽东同志在中国革命的各个历史时期，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，解决了中国革命和建设的重大问题，把中国革命和建设事业引向一个接着一个的胜利，丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。同时也为我国科学界的研究工作提供了犀利的思想武器和正确的工作方法，指导着我国的科学蓬勃地向前发展。
    十年来，我国科学工作在党中央和毛泽东同志领导下，依靠全体科学工作者的共同努力，无疑地已经取得了巨大的成就。
    二
    科学工作中，社会主义同资本主义的两条道路的斗争和这个斗争的胜利，对于我国科学事业的发展，具有决定性的意义。社会主义革命是一个极为深刻、广泛和彻底的革命，它不仅必须在经济战线上进行，而且必须在政治战线和思想战线上进行。科学工作的两条道路的斗争，便是思想文化领域的社会主义革命的一个重要部分。
    科学工作中两条道路的斗争，不但是不可避免的，而且是相当激烈的。我国科学界是高级知识分子聚集的地方，其中大多数是资产阶级的知识分子。他们有某些有用的知识。工人阶级有必要争取、团结他们为社会主义建设服务。而这些资产阶级的科学家，虽然大多数有爱国的情绪，同情赞助民主革命，但是由于浸透了资产阶级的世界观和习惯，许多人对社会主义革命采取保留的态度，有些人甚至采取反对的态度。资产阶级的科学家对资本主义存有留恋和幻想。他们中不少人对于无产阶级和共产党的领导并不心服，对于为社会主义服务并不热心。不仅如此，他们总是要按照他们的资产阶级观点来改造人民的事业。他们这种资产阶级思想如不改变，就必然同无产阶级发生冲突。
    为了帮助资产阶级科学家进行思想改造，党曾经进行了一系列的工作，包括1952年的知识分子思想改造运动和1954到1955年批判以胡适为代表的资产阶级学术思想的运动。通过这些思想批判，再加上参加各项革命群众运动的实践、科学工作的实践和马克思列宁主义的学习，许多科学家逐步增加了对人民革命和社会主义的认识。但是，思想改造过程是阶级立场和世界观的转变，不能指望通过一次两次运动在短时间内就能完全解决问题。思想斗争总是要反复进行的，在一定条件下，还会尖锐化的。
    事情果然如此。1957年春天，国内资产阶级右派发动了反党反社会主义的猖狂进攻。科学界的一小撮右派分子公然提出了一个反社会主义的科学纲领，一场尖锐的斗争便由他们挑动起来了。
    右派分子的反社会主义科学纲领和他们当时鸣放的言论，主要集中在以下几个问题上：（一）反对党对科学工作的领导，说什么“外行不能领导内行”，标榜所谓“科学自由”；（二）反对科学工作为社会主义建设服务，反对理论联系实际这一马克思主义的根本原则，反对根据国家需要有计划地进行科学工作，说什么“科学根本不能有计划”，“科学工作不能有丝毫的功利考虑”，标榜所谓“为科学而科学”；（三）反对马克思主义在我们国家的领导地位，要求资产阶级的社会学、经济学、历史学、唯心论哲学复辟。科学界右派分子的目的是很清楚的，那就是要篡夺党对科学工作的领导权，按照资本主义道路改造我国的科学事业，以资产阶级社会科学为资本主义复辟开辟道路。十分明显，右派分子在科学战线上的进攻，是他们反党反社会主义的全面进攻的一个重要方面，这是科学战线上的两条道路斗争尖锐化的表现。
    在党的领导下，广大科学工作者和全国人民一道，揭露和粉碎了右派的阴谋，对反社会主义的科学纲领进行了彻底的批判。那些在右派进攻中曾经一度陷于迷惑的人们，也迅速转变到反右派的立场上来了。通过这场斗争，右派分子完全被孤立了，广大的科学工作者受到了深刻的教育，进一步提高了政治认识，向党向人民更加靠拢了。
    在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，科学界在整风运动中继续展开了关于科学工作两条道路的大辩论。这场大辩论，使广大科学工作者进一步认识了，在科学工作中必须坚持党的领导、科学必须为社会主义建设服务，以及必须正确处理理论与实际、个人与集体、专家与群众、红与专的相互关系。这场辩论属于人民内部矛盾的范围，是按照“团结——批评——团结”的原则进行的。
    经过反右和整风，广大科学工作者在不同程度上改变了他们原来的政治态度和思想状况，大多数人开始认识到自己在社会主义革命问题上、在科学工作两条道路问题上的一些错误观点，并且表示决心改造自己，争取成为人民所需要的红色专家。这样，就为贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线实现科学工作的大跃进，准备了必要的条件。
    科学工作中两条道路的斗争，现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。但是这并不意味着斗争的最后结束。十年来，我们的经验证明，在科学领域中，如同在其他思想文化领域中一样，必须把社会主义革命进行到底。否则，社会主义科学事业的顺利发展是不可能的。党对科学工作的领导必须继续巩固和加强。建立一支忠于工人阶级和社会主义事业的强大的科学工作者的队伍的工作必须加紧进行。我们科学工作者不应当满足于现有的进步，必须继续前进，坚持不懈地进行自我思想改造，为把自己彻底改造成为工人阶级的科学工作者而努力。
    三
    根据毛泽东同志的倡议，党的八届二次会议通过了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。总路线的思想一经深入到群众中去，立即掀起了各方面建设事业大跃进的高潮。在全国大跃进的形势下，科学事业也进入了一个跃进式地发展的时期。不仅是科学机关、高等学校，而且在工厂、在矿山、在广大的农村，到处都看到人们精神振奋、意气风发、斗志昂扬地向着科学的堡垒进军，并且取得了伟大的成就。
    速度快、规模大，是大跃进中科学工作的特点。例如，关于稀有元素的地质调查，一年来的工作远远超过了原订的第二个五年计划；稀土元素的分析和分离工作，迅速达到了世界先进水平。一些新建立的科学部门，进展尤其迅速，如半导体的研究在短期内即掌握了材料提纯的技术，试制出高频率、大功率的电子器件。每秒一万次的电子计算机也是在这一段时间内制造出来的。这些都大大地超过了十二年规划原订的要求。
    有些规模浩大的工作，过去总是因为人力不足而迟滞不前。大跃进以来，由于发动了广大群众，实行专家和群众相结合，这一类工作就顺利地开展了起来。在半年多的时间内，有十九个省完成了土壤普查；野生植物的调查、吸血虫病的防治等等也都以前所未有的规模、前所未有的速度，获得了前所未有的成就。在星罗棋布的人民公社试验田上，对农业生产中如何实行“八字宪法”，进行了广泛的科学观察和研究，总结农业丰产的经验，这对于发展我国农业科学有莫大的意义。在大炼钢铁运动中，全国九千万人上山找矿，对于查明我国煤铁资源起了很大的作用。过去学者们认为秦岭地区不会有大铁矿，地质人员费了很久时间也没有找到矿床，1958年冬群众一上山，一个很大的铁矿便被发现了。由于群众的找矿、报矿运动，1958年全国新探明的铁矿储量等于过去探明的全部储量的76％。
    在大跃进中，哲学社会科学方面，群众性的研究工作，同样有了很大的开展，取得了显著的成绩。
    在这里不可能把大跃进的成就一一列举出来。总之，两年来的成绩大大胜过了过去好多年。这是党的总路线的胜利，也是党的群众路线的胜利。什么是科学事业中的群众路线？根据已有的经验，主要是：在全国范围内要发动人民群众参加技术革命、文化革命，把科学机构的工作同广大群众的科学活动结合起来，把提高和普及结合起来，并且采取中央与地方并举的方针发展科学事业；在科学机构内，要充分发挥全体科学工作者特别是青年的创造性和主动性，把青年的干劲和老科学家的作用很好地结合起来。而要实现这一切，就必须实行政治挂帅、破除迷信、解放思想，掀起科学战线上的群众运动。
    科学归根到底来源于实践，而又是为实践服务的。千百万劳动人民的生产实践和革命实践是科学发展的源泉。科学的不断创造和发展，都是在人民群众的直接间接参与下完成的。科学一脱离群众，便成为无源之水，无本之木。反之，科学和群众联系得愈密切，便发展得愈快。
    我国是一个六亿多人口的大国，但是一穷二白，科学落后。人民热烈地要求实现技术革命、文化革命，摆脱这种落后状态。在科学战线上，如果忽视群众的这种要求，不依靠群众的主动性和创造精神，光靠专门科学机构和少数专家进行工作，那就决不可能使工作多快好省地向前发展，那就一定会落后于客观形势发展的需要，那就一定要犯右倾保守的错误。党的社会主义建设的总路线照耀着我们，使得我们避开了这种错误，坚持了群众路线的方针，并在实际工作中取得了显著的成效。大跃进中层出不穷的事例，证明了群众的创造力是无穷无尽的。例如：云南镇雄一个气象台的普通观测员和农民一道总结了群众长期观察天气的经验，创造出一套单站补充天气预报的方法；在全国推行了这个方法以后，我国短期天气预报的准确率比1957年提高了10％左右。这不过是群众技术革新运动中无数生动事例中的一个。从这里不难看出劳动人民对学习科学的热烈愿望，不难看出他们在科学上的创造才能。尽管他们的发明和创造一般还不具备系统的理论形态，然而其中有不少真知灼见，却是一些饱学之士所不曾具有的。我们要以满腔热忱帮助他们学习和前进，并且把他们的发明创造当作科学的财富，把它提高到系统的理论水平；决不能以资产阶级老爷式的态度来加以蔑视或者排斥。
    自然科学的工作要依靠群众，哲学社会科学的工作同样要依靠群众。如果不深入群众，不密切联系群众的革命斗争，不把专业队伍和非专业队伍的工作结合起来，哲学社会科学的健全发展是不能想像的。
    我们强调发动群众、依靠群众，但丝毫也没有看轻专门科学机构的作用的意思。正相反，我们的方针是要把广大群众的劳动创造和专门科学机构的工作很好地结合起来。群众技术革命、文化革命越广泛，对专门科学机构的要求也就越迫切。因为专门科学机构可以成为提高群众的发明创造、向群众普及科学知识的中心。这种科学机构现在是显得太少了，为了适应国家需要，根据中央与地方并举的方针，去年以来，从省市到厂矿和人民公社，各种科学机构、科学组织大量地建立起来了。这样就出现了高级、中级、初级的三类科学研究机构相结合的科学网，有了这种科学网，就可以使群众的技术革命、文化革命开展得更加有力，从而使我国的科学既能在普及的基础上提高，又能在提高的指导下普及起来。
    不仅在专家和劳动群众的关系上，存在着应否依靠群众的问题，就在专门科学机构和队伍内部，也存在着应否依靠群众的问题。在后一种情况下，问题的中心是如何发挥青年科学人员的创造性和积极性。青年不仅是科学的未来、我们的接班人，也是当前科学研究工作的重要力量。一般地说，青年在科学上还不成熟，需要老老实实地刻苦钻研，虚心向前辈请教，这是理所当然。但是他们的革命热情，他们的创造才能，他们对新事物的敏感，他们那种找到真理就坚持不放、勇往直前的气概，是十分可贵的。我们老一辈的科学家，必须热情地鼓励他们，使他们敢想、敢说、敢干；必须放手让他们做工作，帮助他们攻克这样或那样的难关，把工作做好；同时还必须放下架子向他们的长处学习。老科学家往往冷静有余而革命热情不足，甚至没有，所以必须向青年们学习，以鼓足自己的干劲，防止保守。
    在大跃进中，全国科学机构和高等学校的老科学家与青年、教师与学生，在党的领导下，本着教学相长、互助团结的精神，本着革命热情和实事求是相结合的方针，积极开展了科学研究工作。在短短一年多时间内，完成了许多研究项目，其中有很大一部分是青年做出来的。从大跃进开始到现在还不到两年，在这一段时期中，尽管有些研究工作做得还不够完善，甚至很不完善，但是人们从我们取得的巨大成就中，已经能够清楚地看出群众路线在科学事业中的威力。在科学工作中贯彻群众路线，是高速度地发展我国科学事业的根本保证，对于这一点，不应当再有什么怀疑了。
    四
    1956年毛泽东同志和党中央提出了在学术文化领域中实行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。这是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针。这个方针是完全符合艺术和科学发展的客观规律的。
    科学发展的过程，人们认识客观真理的过程，是一个十分复杂曲折的、充满着矛盾斗争的过程，而不可能是一个正确认识简单增长的直线过程。人们进行科学研究的时候，单是由于掌握材料的差别，观察事物角度与深刻程度的差别，处理问题的方法和探索解答的途径的差别，就会产生各种认识上的分歧和矛盾。这些分歧和矛盾，是认识发展过程中必然的产物，是认识领域内正常的现象。全部科学史都证明，认识的发展，正是这些不断解决着又不断产生着的认识上的矛盾的斗争的过程。
    应当说，自然科学中各种学说和学派之间的争论，多数都属于这类认识上的矛盾。哲学社会科学中马克思主义学术工作者之间的不同学术观点的争论，也有颇大部分属于这类性质的矛盾。对于这样一类学术上的是非问题，显然应当通过学术界的自由讨论去解决，通过科学的实践去解决，而不应当采取简单的方法去解决。只有使争论充分展开，才能推进认识的发展，逐渐克服错误的认识以达到正确的认识，克服片面的认识以达到全面的认识，克服表面的认识以达到深入的认识。任何阻碍科学上的自由争论的想法和做法，如认为学术权威的意见不容怀疑，或轻率地下定结论，强制推行一种学派观点，禁止另一种学派观点等，都是违背认识通过矛盾斗争而发展的客观规律的，都会阻碍科学的进步，因而是不正确的。
    当然，学术问题上不同观点、意见的矛盾，并不都仅仅属于认识上的矛盾的范围。在我国目前条件下，许多学术观点的矛盾是和不同阶级的立场、世界观之间的矛盾联系着的。在我国社会中，资产阶级和无产阶级之间在意识形态方面的斗争还要长期存在，这种斗争反映到学术领域中来，就表现为马克思主义学术观点同资产阶级学术观点之间的斗争。这种斗争在自然科学的理论观点中，也是存在着的；就是在马克思主义学术工作者之间的争论当中，也会有所反映。
    对于我们马克思主义者来说，同资产阶级思想是不能有任何妥协调和的。必须展开坚决的斗争，必须在一切科学领域中发展马克思主义，克服资产阶级学术思想。这是毫无疑义的事情。问题只是在于，究竟采取怎样的方法才能真正达到这个目的。为什么对于学术问题上的资产阶级思想，我们也主张采取百家争鸣的方针，而不采取禁止它们发表的方针呢？毛泽东同志说的很清楚：“对待人民内部的思想问题，对待精神世界的问题，用简单的方法去处理，不但不会收效，而且非常有害。不让发表错误意见，结果错误意见还是存在着。而正确的意见如果是在温室里培养出来的，如果没有见过风雨，没有取得免疫力，遇到错误意见就不能打胜仗。因此，只有采取讨论的方法，批评的方法，说理的方法，才能真正发展正确的意见，克服错误的意见，才能真正解决问题。”
    当然，百家争鸣的方针，是人民内部的自由在学术领域中的表现，它是以社会主义政治方向为前提的。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中提出了六条政治标准作为辨别方向的准则。如果有人违背这六条政治标准，进行破坏社会主义、复辟资本主义的政治活动，那是无产阶级专政制度所不能容许的。政治上的属于敌我矛盾性质的斗争，同在学术观点上辩论是非的百家争鸣是根本不同的，不能混为一谈。但是如果有人要利用百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针来进行反社会主义活动，这也没有什么可怕，让毒草暴露出真面目，更便于群众识别它，锄掉它。
    贯彻执行百家争鸣方针的过程，就是各门学术日趋繁荣的过程。
    在系统地批判资产阶级学术思想方面，我们过去已经进行过很多工作。去年在全民整风运动的基础上，学术界又开展了一个规模宏大的批判资产阶级学术思想的运动。这一次的批判，差不多涉及每一个学术领域和所有的学术工作单位，它的突出的特点，是广大的青年教师、青年研究人员和学生都参加进来了。他们从斗争中得到锻炼，生动地进行了一次马克思主义学习，培养了战斗的学风。这次批判是健康的，有丰富收获的。同资产阶级学术思想进行斗争，通过这种斗争来发展马克思主义的力量，是我们长期的任务，今后还要在认真的科学研究的基础上，继续进行。
    近年以来，在哲学、经济学、历史学、文学、美学、心理学、遗传学、地质学等学术领域中，进行了许多学术问题的讨论。在现实问题的理论探讨方面，在历史遗产的批判整理方面，在各门学科基本理论的研究方面，提出了不少新的问题和新的论点。所有这些讨论都是很有意义的，在克服一些不正确的意见，发展和丰富正确的意见，或推进对这些问题作更深入的研究等方面，都起了积极的作用。通过学术争论，大大促进了马克思主义新生力量的成长，同时呈现了我国学术界生动活泼地向前发展的新气象。
    几年以来实际生活已经表明了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一方针的正确性和生命力。这个方针对于我国科学繁荣发展的深远影响，时间过得愈久，将表现得愈加鲜明。
                              * * * *
    十年来我国科学事业的成就是巨大的，但是，对于我国整个社会主义建设事业迅速发展的需要来说，还是很不够的。为了实现技术革命、文化革命的伟大历史任务，科学工作必须以更大的规模、更高的速度向前迈进。这是完全可能的，因为我们有充分的优越条件。
    我们有优越的社会主义制度。在这个制度下，科学获得了真正的解放，生产的高速度发展和丰富的革命实践使科学的发展得到最大的源泉和推动力。在这个制度下，科学才可以有计划地发展，可以统一组织我们向科学进军的力量，合理地利用物质技术条件，保持科学各部门间的平衡关系，保证科学成果最有效的利用。在这个制度下，广大群众的聪明才智、创造性和主动精神，得到充分发挥，科学人材的成长的速度也远远超过资本主义。
    我们有社会主义国家国际主义的援助。我国科学事业取得这样巨大的成就，同苏联和其他社会主义国家的巨大援助是分不开的。十年来，我们学习苏联先进科学的成就和经验，在苏联的帮助下，完成了许多重大的科学研究项目。1958年中苏两国签订了有关科学合作的协定。其他社会主义兄弟国家和我国之间差不多都有了文化合作协定或者科学合作协定。我们的合作是愈来愈密切的。毫无疑问，我们将永远互助、共同提高。
    我们有党的领导和马克思列宁主义思想的指导。党正确地指出了我国科学事业发展的方向，制定了科学工作的各项方针、政策。沿着党所指引的道路，我国科学事业必将在已有的基础上取得更加迅速的发展。
    我们的前途是无限光明的。我们全国的科学工作者必须坚决拥护党的领导，在总路线的光辉照耀之下，努力使自己成为红透专深的社会主义建设人材，更好地为社会主义建设服务，使祖国建设事业由伟大的胜利走向更伟大的胜利。
