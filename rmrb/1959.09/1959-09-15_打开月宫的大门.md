Yesterday at dawn, at 5:02 AM Beijing time, as the stars were being eclipsed by the rising sun, the second Soviet cosmic rocket accurately reached the surface of the moon, leaving the mark of the glorious Soviet emblem there. This marks the first time in human history that a flight from Earth to another planet has been completed, and marks another big step forward for mankind in the long march of exploring the mysteries of the universe. The Chinese people, along with the people of the world, cheer for the arrival of the Soviet cosmic rocket on the moon, and cheer for the brilliant achievements created by the Soviet people, scientists, engineers, and workers!

Less than two years have passed since the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957, and it has already made astonishing progress in conquering space. The Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite, which achieved the first cosmic velocity, once shocked the world. A month later, the Soviet Union successfully launched the second artificial Earth satellite. The weight of this satellite jumped from 83.6 kilograms for the first one to 508.3 kilograms, and it also carried an experimental animal. On May 15, 1958, the third large satellite, weighing 1,327 kilograms, soared from Soviet soil. This year, at the beginning of the new year, the first cosmic rocket with the Soviet national emblem flag obtained the second cosmic velocity (11.2 kilometers per second), broke free from Earth's gravity, and opened the door for mankind to glimpse the mysteries of the universe. This rocket flew over the lunar region, and after completing its mission of exploring the moon, it roamed space, becoming the first artificial planet. In a short period of time, the second cosmic rocket has now arrived on the moon according to the route designated by Soviet scientists.

What is particularly admirable is the astonishing accuracy with which the second cosmic rocket reached the moon. According to the prediction made by Soviet scientists at the time of launch, this cosmic rocket was scheduled to reach the surface of the moon at 0:05 AM Moscow time on September 14. The result was: this rocket broke through the 379,000-kilometer-long sky and reached the surface of the moon at 0:02:24 AM on September 14. Only two minutes and thirty-six seconds difference from the estimated time! This degree of precision has made even Western scientists admire it immensely. American scientist Leavitt, director of the Fels Planetarium in New York, praised: "The Soviet lunar rocket guidance system must be incredibly good." A scientist from the West German Observatory and Rocket Station said: This achievement can be compared to a sharpshooter hitting the eye of a fly with a small-caliber rifle from ten kilometers away. Lovell, one of Britain's leading authorities on world space science, said: From any angle, it is amazing.

Undoubtedly, the second cosmic rocket, through its scientific instruments, sent back extremely valuable observation materials. Soviet scientists have already obtained new and rich materials on the Earth's magnetic field and the Moon's magnetic field, the radiation belts around the Earth, the intensity and intensity changes of cosmic radiation, the heavy nuclei in cosmic radiation, the gaseous composition of interplanetary matter, meteor particles, and so on. It has paved the way for humans to land on the moon and further explore the universe, and has also opened a new chapter in the study of the universe. This outstanding achievement in Soviet science and technology is the pride of the Soviet people, the pride of the entire socialist camp, and the pride of progressive mankind.

However, in the United States, the ruling group uses science and rocket technology to serve their policy of strength and war policy. What they think about is not the heroic cause of mankind conquering the universe, but how to use modern rocket weapons to threaten the peace-loving people of the world. However, in the competition of science and technology between the two social systems, the United States has failed again and again. The United States launched five cosmic rockets from August 17, 1958 to March 3, 1959, and their results can only prove the backwardness of the United States. On August 17, 1958, "Pioneer" left the ground 640 kilometers and exploded 77 seconds after launch. On October 11, 1958, "Pioneer 1" deviated from its orbit after flying for 5.5 hours and burned up over the South Pacific. "Pioneer 2" burned up in East Central Africa 45 minutes after launch, and "Pioneer 3" fell into the atmosphere and burned up after flying for 1.5 hours. "Pioneer 4," launched on March 3, 1959, flew past the moon at a distance of approximately 60,000 kilometers from the moon and entered an orbit around the sun. However, the weight of the scientific instruments and containers of this rocket was only 5.9 kilograms, while the weight of the scientific instruments and containers of the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket was 361.3 kilograms. This stark contrast proves that the United States has long lagged far behind the Soviet Union in science and technology. Now that the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket has been successfully launched, it further demonstrates the Soviet Union's leading advantage.

The socialist system has opened up a vast world for the leap-forward development of economy, science, technology, and culture, and for the people to give full play to their intelligence and talents. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet scientists and the broad masses of workers have cooperated closely, fully exerted their enthusiasm and creativity, climbed to the peak of world science and technology, enriched science with unparalleled contributions, and benefited mankind. The success of the launch of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket is also the victory of the socialist system and the victory of the cause of peace.

    打开月宫的大门
    昨天拂晓，北京时间的五时零二分，当群星被初升的太阳光辉掩没的时候，苏联发射的第二个宇宙火箭准确地到达了月球表面，在那里留下了光辉的苏联国徽的标记。这标志着人类历史上第一次完成从地球到另一个星球的飞行，标志着人类在探索宇宙奥秘的长征中又迈出了一大步。中国人民同全世界人民一起为苏联宇宙火箭到达月球而欢呼，为苏联人民、科学家、工程师和工人所创造的辉煌成就而欢呼！
    1957年10月4日苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星，到现在还不到两年，已经在征服宇宙方面取得了十分惊人的发展。苏联第一个人造地球卫星，获得了第一宇宙的速度，当时曾经震动了全世界。一个月以后，苏联又成功地发射了第二个人造地球卫星。这个卫星的重量，已由第一颗的八十三点六公斤一跃而达到五百零八点三公斤，而且还带有一个实验动物。1958年5月15日第三颗重达一千三百二十七公斤的大卫星，又从苏维埃土地上腾空而起。今年新春，带有苏联国徽旗帜的第一个宇宙火箭，又获得了第二宇宙速度（每秒十一点二公里），摆脱了地球引力，打开了人类窥察宇宙奥秘的大门。这个火箭飞过月球区域，并在完成了探测月球的任务后，遨游太空，成了第一颗人造行星。曾几何时，如今第二个宇宙火箭又按照苏联科学家指定的路线抵达月球了。
    特别值得赞叹的，是第二个宇宙火箭到达月球的惊人的准确程度。按照发射时苏联科学家的预测，这个宇宙火箭预定在9月14日莫斯科时间零时五分到达月球表面。结果是：这个火箭突破三十七万九千公里的长空，在9月14日零时二分二十四秒到达月球表面。同预计时间只差二分三十六秒！这种精确的程度，使得西方的科学家也不能不钦佩万分。美国纽约非尔斯行星观察台台长勒维特称赞说：“苏联月球火箭导向装置一定好得要命”。西德天文台和火箭站一个科学家说：这个成就，可以用一个神枪手在十公里以外用一支小口径步枪击中一只苍蝇的眼睛相比。英国世界空间学权威之一洛弗耳说：从任何角度看，都是很神奇的。
    无疑的，第二个宇宙火箭，通过它的科学仪器，发回来了极其宝贵的观察材料。对于地球磁场和月球的磁场，地球周围的辐射带，宇宙辐射的强度和强度变化；宇宙辐射中的重核，行星际物质的气体成分、流星粒子等等，苏联科学家已经获得新的丰富的材料。它为人类登上月球，进一步探索了道路，也揭开了考察宇宙的新的一页。苏联科学和技术上这一杰出的成就，是苏联人民的骄傲，也是整个社会主义阵营的骄傲，进步人类的骄傲。
    可是在美国，统治集团把科学、把火箭技术用来为他们的实力政策和战争政策服务。他们想的不是人类征服宇宙的豪迈事业，而是怎样利用现代的火箭武器来威胁全世界的和平人民。但是，在两种社会制度的科学技术方面的竞赛中，美国一次又一次地失败了。美国从1958年8月17日到1959年3月3日，已经发射了五次宇宙火箭，它们的结果只能证明了美国的落后。1958年8月17日，“先驱者”离开了地面六百四十公里，发射七十七秒后就爆炸了。1958年10月11日，“先驱者一号”飞行五点五小时后偏离轨道，在南太平洋上空焚毁。“先驱者二号”发射后四十五分钟在中非东部焚毁，“先驱者三号”飞行一点五小时后坠入大气层烧毁。1959年3月3日发射的“先驱者四号”在距月球约六万公里处飞过月球，并进入绕太阳运行的轨道。可是这个火箭的科学仪器和容器的重量只有五点九公斤，而苏联的第一个宇宙火箭的科学仪器和容器的重量却有三百六十一点三公斤。这个鲜明的对比，证明了美国在科学和技术方面早就远远落在苏联之后。现在苏联第二个宇宙火箭发射成功，进一步表明了苏联遥遥领先的优势。
    社会主义制度为经济、科学、技术和文化的飞跃发展，为人民发挥聪明才智，开辟了广阔天地。在苏联共产党的领导下，苏联科学家和广大劳动者密切合作，充分发挥了他们的积极性和创造性，攀登上世界科学和技术的巅峰，以无与伦比的贡献丰富了科学，为人类造福。苏联第二个宇宙火箭发射的成功，也就是社会主义制度的胜利，是和平事业的胜利。
