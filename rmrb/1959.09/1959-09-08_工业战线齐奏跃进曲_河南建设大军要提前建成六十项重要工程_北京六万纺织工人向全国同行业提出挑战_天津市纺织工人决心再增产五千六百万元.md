Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 6th: Henan Province's construction army of over 200,000 people is enthusiastically responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, launching a major campaign in September, determined to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with the glorious achievement of completing sixty important projects ahead of schedule.

Among the important projects to be completed and put into production or delivered for use in various parts of Henan before the end of September are the four three-ton to six-ton converters of Anyang Iron and Steel Plant, a 100-cubic-meter blast furnace, and the expansion projects of Zhengzhou, Minggang, and Luoyang Iron and Steel Plants; the No. 7 mine in Pingdingshan, the Zhangjiazhuang mine in Hebi, and the Xiamo mine in Yima; the welding workshop of Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, the auxiliary workshop of Luoyang Bearing Factory, and the expansion project of Luoyang Thermal Power Plant; and the furfural workshop of Zhengzhou Oil and Fat Chemical Plant and the calcium carbide workshop of Xinyang Comprehensive Chemical Plant. In addition, there are also railway double-tracking projects in the textile industry and transportation industries.

Most of these projects are key projects above the state quota, which are the core of Henan Province's new equipment capacity in basic construction this year. After they are put into production, calculated according to the designed annual output, they can increase steel by 370,000 tons, iron by 108,000 tons, raw coal by 1.32 million tons, cement by 64,000 tons, and cotton cloth by 3.4 million square meters. The early completion of this batch of projects will not only add new strength to Henan's completion and overfulfillment of this year's production increase and savings plan, but also, after this year's adjustment and trial production stage, will lay a favorable material foundation for continued leap forward next year.

In order to ensure the early completion of these major projects, various construction units and construction enterprises have taken a series of measures and specifically arranged the daily construction progress plan. The Party secretaries, company managers, and other leading cadres of the construction units responsible for capital construction and the construction units are on the construction site every day, grasping the progress and quality, and solving construction problems in a timely manner. The units also brought into play the spirit of large-scale collaboration and adjusted building materials with each other. The various construction units of the Provincial Department of Construction Engineering alone have recently adjusted more than 610 tons of steel, which basically meets the needs of key projects in the system. Various machinery factories are also actively processing and manufacturing equipment, striving to deliver goods ahead of schedule to ensure the supply of complete sets of equipment with guaranteed quality and quantity.

At present, the workers and staff on various construction sites are carrying out a vigorous socialist labor competition to speed up the progress of various projects. The workers responsible for the construction of Anyang Iron and Steel Company used to take four hours to prefabricate a reinforced concrete roof panel, but now it only takes two hours, and the quality has reached excellent; in the past, the site was cleaned up after the project was completed, but now it is cleaned up while construction is underway, and it can be put into production immediately after the project is completed. The workers building the Zhengzhou No. 4 Iron and Steel Plant are also constantly breaking production quotas. As of September 3, the factory's large columns, crane beams, thin-web plates, and other concrete components have all been poured and can be hoisted soon.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: Beijing's textile workers held a vow-taking leap forward meeting on the 5th, and according to cotton spinning, wool spinning, knitting, and printing and dyeing, they respectively proposed to launch a friendship competition with their counterparts nationwide.

The textile workers' reporting team reported to the conference on the achievements of the first eight months of this year and the latest production results. In the first eight months of this year, the total output value of Beijing's textile industry increased by 45% compared with the same period last year, and the output of cotton yarn and woolen fabrics increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year. The output of cotton cloth, knitwear, and printed and dyed cloth has also increased significantly. Various factories have trial-produced more than 1,100 kinds of new products with excellent quality, beautiful appearance, and generous design, and more than 300 kinds have already begun mass production. After studying the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the city's textile workers have become more energetic. The No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mills have completed their plans every day at the beginning of September, and their output and quality have risen sharply. The daily output of Qinghe Woolen Mill and Beijing Woolen Textile Mill has also increased by 10% to 20% compared with early August.

At the vow-taking leap forward meeting, textile worker representatives, on behalf of the city's 60,000 textile workers, proposed to their counterparts across the country to launch a friendship competition. The workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory proposed: to ensure the completion of the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule, to vigorously increase the variety of colors and patterns, so that the new varieties put into production this year will account for 30% of all products. The competition conditions for the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mills are: to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of the annual national plan, the rate of first-class and top-grade cotton yarn reaches 99.5%, and strive for 100%; the rate of standard cotton yarn reaches 100%.

Zhang Qinqiu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry, spoke at the conference. She said: The national textile industry has made significant achievements in the first half of this year, and the output of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, yarn for knitting, and woolen fabrics has increased by 30% to 55% compared with the same period last year. This year, the national cotton yarn production will increase by 34.4% compared with last year. Completing this plan will complete the predetermined targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and raise my country's textile industry to a newer level of production. She pointed out: Under the call of the Party Central Committee, the national textile workers are setting off a new upsurge of a vigorous production increase and savings campaign. Leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the front line of production, lead production well, and fight heroically to complete the annual production plan of the textile industry ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 6th: More than 100,000 textile workers in Tianjin actively responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, thoroughly discussed the production increase and savings plan, and decided that under the circumstances that the number of employees this year is reduced by about 10% compared with last year, in addition to completing the plan to increase the total output value by 10.82% compared with last year, they will increase production by another 56 million yuan, including an increase of 12,900 pieces of cotton yarn and an increase of more than 7.8 million meters of cotton cloth.

Now, the city's textile workers are both putting forward measures and increasing shifts and increasing the number of spindles and looms. When increasing the speed of the vehicles, the workers of each factory used the experience of high-speedization last year, thoroughly repaired the machines in advance, and strengthened cleaning work; at the same time, they adopted the method of "adding frequently and adding less" to ensure that the production is stable after the speed of the vehicles is increased, so that the unit output is generally improved. Before increasing the speed of the vehicles, the No. 4 State-owned Cotton Mill took 39 measures to repair the machines well; therefore, after the speed of the vehicles was increased, there were not many yarn breakages, the unit output of cotton yarn increased by 6.82%, the unit output of cotton cloth increased by 15.5%, and the quality of yarn and cloth was also very good. The dyeing factory's production tasks have increased a lot this year, but the workers proposed to increase production by another 3 million yuan in addition to completing the plans issued by the higher authorities.

    工业战线齐奏跃进曲
    河南建设大军要提前建成六十项重要工程
    北京六万纺织工人向全国同行业提出挑战
    天津市纺织工人决心再增产五千六百万元
    新华社郑州6日电　河南省二十多万建设大军热烈响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，大战9月份，决心以提前建成六十项重要工程的辉煌成绩，迎接国庆十周年。
    9月底以前，河南各地将建成投入生产或交付使用的重要工程当中，有安阳钢铁厂的四座三吨到六吨的转炉，一座一百立方米的高炉，和郑州、明港、洛阳等钢铁厂的扩建工程；有平顶山的七号矿井，鹤壁的张家庄矿井和义马的下磨矿井；有洛阳矿山机器厂的焊接车间，洛阳轴承厂的辅助车间和洛阳热电站的扩建工程；有郑州油脂化工厂的糠醛车间，信阳综合化工厂的电石车间。此外，还有纺织工业和交通运输业中的铁路复线工程等项目。
    这些工程大部分是国家限额以上的重点项目，是今年河南省基本建设新增设备能力的核心。它们投入生产以后，按设计年产量计算，可以增加钢三十七万吨，铁十万八千吨，原煤一百三十二万吨，水泥六万四千吨，棉布三百四十万平方米。提前建成这批工程，不仅给河南完成和超额完成今年的增产节约计划增添生力军，而且经过今年的调整和试生产阶段，将为明年继续跃进打下有利的物质基础。
    各个建筑单位和建筑企业为了保证这些主要工程提前建成，已经采取了一系列的措施，具体安排了每日施工的进度计划。建设单位负责基建的党委书记、公司经理和施工单位的其他领导干部，每天都在工地上抓进度、抓质量，及时解决施工的问题。各单位还发挥了大协作的精神，互相调剂了建筑材料。仅省建筑工程厅的各个建设单位，最近就调剂了钢材六百一十多吨，基本上满足了本系统的重点工程的需要。各机械厂也在积极加工制造设备，力争提前交货，保证设备按质、按量成套供应。
    目前，各建设工地上的职工们，正在开展热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛，加快各项工程的进展。担负建设安阳钢铁公司的工人们，过去预制一块钢筋混凝土屋面板需要四小时，现在只用两个小时，而且质量达到了优等；过去工程干完后才清理现场，现在边施工、边清理，工程一完马上就可投入生产。建设郑州第四钢铁厂的工人们，也不断突破生产定额，到9月3日止，这个厂的大型柱子、行车梁、薄腹板等混凝土制件，已经全部浇筑完毕，很快就可以吊装。
    据新华社7日讯　北京市纺织工人在5日举行誓师跃进大会，按照棉纺、毛纺、针织、印染四个工种，分别向全国同行业倡议开展友谊竞赛。
    纺织工人报喜大队向大会报告了今年头八个月的成就和最新的生产成绩。今年头八个月北京市纺织工业总产值比去年同期增长45％，棉纱、毛织品的产量比去年同期各增长40％以上，棉布、针织品、印染布的产量也都有很大增长。各工厂试制了质地优良、美观大方的新产品一千一百多种，有三百多种已经开始大批生产。全市纺织职工在学习了党的八届八中全会公报和决议之后，干劲更大，国棉一、二、三厂等9月份开头天天完成计划，产量、质量直线上升。清河制呢厂和北京毛纺织厂日产量也比8月上旬提高10％到20％。
    在誓师跃进大会上，纺织工人代表们代表全市六万纺织职工，向全国同行提出展开友谊竞赛的倡议。北京针织厂的职工们提出：保证提前一个月完成全年生产计划，大力增加花色品种，使今年投入生产的新品种占到全部产品的30％。国棉一、二、三厂的竞赛条件是：保证全面超额完成全年国家计划，棉纱上等一级品率达到99.5％，力争100％；棉纱标准品率达到100％。
    纺织工业部副部长张琴秋在大会上讲了话，她说：今年上半年全国纺织工业取得了重大成就，棉纱、棉布、针织用纱、毛织品的产量比去年同期增长了30％到55％。今年全国的棉纱生产将比去年增长34.4％，完成这个计划，就可以提前三年完成第二个五年计划预定指标、使我国纺织工业提高到一个更新的生产水平。她指出：全国纺织职工在党中央的战斗号召下，正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动新高潮。各级领导干部要深入生产第一线，领导好生产，为提前完成纺织工业的全年生产计划而英勇奋斗。
    据新华社天津6日电　天津市十几万名纺织工人，积极响应党中央的号召，深入讨论了增产节约计划，决心在今年职工人数比去年减少10％左右的情况下，除了完成全年总产值比去年增长10.82％的计划外，再增产五千六百万元，其中棉纱增产一万二千九百件，棉布增产七百八十多万米。
    现在，全市纺织工人们一面提措施，一面增开班次和增加细纱机和织布机的转数。在增加车速的时候，各厂职工都运用了去年高速化的经验，事先彻底检修机器，加强清洁工作；同时，采取“勤加、少加”的办法，保证车速增加以后生产稳定，使单位产量普遍提高。国棉四厂在增加车速以前，采取三十九项措施，把机器检修好；因此，车速提高以后，断头不多，棉纱单位产量提高了6.82％，棉布单位产量提高了15.5％，纱、布的质量也很好。织染厂今年的生产任务增加的很多，但是，职工们提出除了完成上级下达的计划以外，再增产三百万元。
