    Hundreds of Millions of People Working Together to Deeply Root the Foundation of Ten Thousand Years of Happiness
    Zhejiang:
    The Qiantang River Commune in Haining County, with its eighteen production teams, is determined to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, striving to increase the yield of single-season late rice from the original 700 jin per mu to 900 jin.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th: From the islands of the East China Sea to the mountainous areas of southwestern Zhejiang, from the southern shores of Taihu Lake to the plains along the Oujiang and Aojiang rivers, mass rallies are being held everywhere. People are enthusiastically supporting the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, determined to push the campaign for increasing production and practicing economy to a new high tide, to respond to the Party's great call.
    The Zhejiang steel industry, which emerged during the Great Leap Forward, has achieved great success last year and this year. After receiving the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the vast number of steelworkers are in high spirits and have set new leap forward targets. In the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of Banshan Steel Plant, the largest steel plant in Zhejiang Province, workers held a mass meeting as soon as they finished listening to the broadcast, determined to fight to overfulfill the plan. At midnight on the 26th, this workshop completed its steelmaking task for August five days ahead of schedule, achieving an average daily output increase of 19.5% compared to the previous month, with a qualification rate of over 95%. The workers also proposed to double the steel output in the second half of the year compared to the first half. On the 27th, Shaoxing Steel Plant held a workers' representative meeting attended by more than 1,200 people. The workers decided to complete the production tasks for steel, steel products, and pig iron one month ahead of schedule this year.
    At the Xin'an River Hydropower Station construction site, which stretches for more than ten miles, the workers expressed their determination to strive for early power generation to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee. The inter-factory competition between the Reinforcement Plant and the Precast Plant in the Second Construction Zone is even more intense. These two plants have already completed their August tasks on the 22nd and 23rd respectively. Now, these two plants have proposed to complete their September tasks fifteen days and ten days ahead of schedule, respectively.
    The commune members throughout the province were thrilled by the publication of the communique and resolutions. They unanimously praised the great achievements and power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. More than 40,000 commune members of the Qiantang River Commune in Haining County, through "presenting facts, calculating big accounts, comparing achievements, discussing changes, and observing the new outlook," unanimously affirmed that 1958 was an extraordinary leap forward year, and this year has taken a big step forward on the basis of last year's leap forward. On the morning of the 27th, eighteen production teams held separate commune member meetings. The commune members were in high spirits and determined to strive for the early realization of the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program, and proposed to strive to increase the yield of single-season late rice from the original 700 jin per mu to 900 jin, double-season late rice from the original 500 jin to 700 jin, and ramie from the original 500 jin to 600 jin. After studying the communique and resolutions, the Fang Guizhu group of the Siling Production Team in Anji County said: Thanks to the People's Commune, which liberated women's labor, they were able to grow high-yield rice on the high mountains last year. This year, their early rice experimental field also achieved a bumper harvest of more than 1,700 jin per mu; also because of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, they dared to experiment boldly and create excellent results.
    The coastal fishermen were inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. In the Xiaqi Commune on the Zhoushan Islands, more than 5,000 fishermen proposed to make the autumn fishing season surpass the summer fishing season, vigorously engage in offshore netting production, diligently fish offshore and cast nets, diligently repair warehouses, and ensure that not a single tide is missed. The Ant People's Commune's summer fishing season output this year reached 80,000 dan, exceeding the target by more than double. The commune members now propose to complete 40,000 dan on the basis of completing the 50,000 dan autumn fishing season output, ensuring that the autumn fishing season surpasses the summer fishing season.
    Jiangsu:
    The workers of the No. 1 Coal Mining District of Xuzhou Coal Mine are determined to increase the planned daily output from 290 tons to 450 tons, and plan to advance towards 500 tons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th: The people of Jiangsu Province are determined to immediately launch a vigorous mass campaign for increasing production and practicing economy, and respond to the Party's battle call with practical actions.
    On the 27th, thousands of factories in Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Yangzhou and other cities held mass rallies. In Nanjing, nearly 200,000 people in more than 230 factories discussed the leap forward targets and measures of their respective units; many factories' wall newspapers were filled with workers' pledges and resolutions. The Nanjing Leap Forward Steel Plant, which won the national title of advanced small blast furnace unit, produced more than 1,500 tons of iron in the fourth quarter of last year, increased to more than 2,900 tons in the first quarter of this year, and further increased to more than 4,400 tons in the second quarter. This fact fully demonstrates that it is necessary to resolutely implement the General Line and continue to adhere to the Great Leap Forward. The No. 3 blast furnace with a volume of 13 cubic meters in this factory once created a new record of 26 tons per day in August. Now the workers are determined to go to a higher level and further create a new record of 28 tons per day. 50,000 workers of Xuzhou Coal Mine are determined to strive for greater achievements in the coal grabbing battle this year. The No. 1 Coal Mining District, which recently won the safety and high-yield red flag of the entire mine, has increased the planned daily output from 290 tons to 450 tons, and also plans to advance towards 500 tons.
    The farmers of the province enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, determined to exert all their efforts regardless of drought or flood, and seize a double bumper harvest of grain and cotton. The cadres and commune members of Yancheng County analyzed the favorable situation of current agricultural production, believing that the prospects are bright. As long as they exert all their efforts and strengthen field management, the total output of late rice can be increased compared to last year. They put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard in September, making late autumn surpass early autumn, and achieving a full success in every commune and team," and are vigorously carrying out drought resistance, pest control and fertilizer accumulation activities. Lianshui County proposed to seize the last month of the third quarter, ensure a 30% increase in grain production, and welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Farmers in other areas are also working day and night, pushing the "actual production surpassing contracted production" campaign and the drought resistance struggle to a new high tide.
    Jiangxi:
    Shangrao Power Plant completed the third quarter plan ahead of schedule, and will start working on the fourth quarter in September.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th: The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have added infinite enthusiasm and strength to the people of Jiangxi Province who are vigorously engaged in increasing production and practicing economy.
    From the evening of the 26th, for a day and a night, thousands of workers from industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in all special districts, cities, and counties in the province held mass rallies one after another to listen to the communique and resolutions. After discussions, all the workers of Nanchang Light Industry Machinery Factory further launched a new upsurge of completing the national plan ahead of schedule. The workers of Shangrao Power Plant completed the third quarter plan ahead of schedule, winning a full success in the third quarter, and will start working on the fourth quarter in September. Ganzhou Wooden Sailboat Cooperative proposed to increase the transportation efficiency by 30% on the original basis, and increase the loading and unloading volume from the original 2,000 tons per day to 3,000 tons. The transportation volume will be increased from 1,000 tons per day to 2,400 tons.
    The commune members of the people's communes and the workers of the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms in various parts of the province are equally enthusiastic. The commune members of Zhizhu, Litian, and Panzhong communes in Yongxin County decided to set up camps and settle down next to the third-class rice fields, applying fertilizer while chasing fertilizer, launching a night and day campaign to completely eliminate the third-class rice and realize the first-class late rice, ensuring that the late rice surpasses the early rice. After heated discussions, the commune members of Maojialing Commune in the suburbs of Shangrao City decided to revise the planned yield of vegetables per mu from the original 15,000 jin to 18,000 jin. From the 27th, the Pioneer Brigade of Longshi Commune in Jinggangshan began a campaign to accumulate fertilizer, determined to accumulate 12,000 dan of fertilizer in a very short period of time, so that each mu of double-cropped late rice can be fertilized once more.
    Guangdong:
    At a radio rally attended by millions of people, the Secretary of the CPC Quren Coal Mine Committee guaranteed that production, capital construction, and transportation would be increased by 50% on the existing basis, striving to double it.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: The people of Guangdong Province have beaten the drums of continued leap forward, resolutely responding to the great call issued by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with practical actions.
    On the evening of the 28th, the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee jointly convened a radio rally attended by millions of people. Chen Yu, Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and Governor of Guangdong Province, said at the meeting that in the first half of this year, Guangdong Province, like other parts of the country, was in a situation of continued leap forward. The output of various industrial and agricultural products has increased greatly compared with the same period last year. The total industrial output value increased by 57%, raw coal increased by 2.7 times, pig iron increased by 15.8 times, steel increased by 6 times, and freight volume increased by 49%. Although the planting area of early rice was reduced compared with last year and suffered from a major flood disaster, the average yield per unit area of early rice was still higher than last year. At present, the planting area of late rice in the province has reached 33.7 million mu, the planting area of autumn sweet potatoes has reached 7.5 million mu, the planting season is earlier than in previous years, and the wheat seedlings are growing well. Chen Yu said that the above materials fully prove that the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is completely correct, the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward cannot be denied, and some temporary and local shortcomings in the work are only a small finger among ten fingers. The attacks of the right-leaning opportunists are unreasonable, and the slanders of domestic and foreign enemies are even more futile. Finally, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, Chen Yu called on party organizations and the people at all levels to quickly launch a vigorous mass movement to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    Lin Liming, Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and First Secretary of the Hainan District Party Committee, and Liang Xiang, Secretary of the CPC Guangzhou Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, also spoke at the meeting. Zhang Yimei, Secretary of the CPC Quren Coal Mine Committee, said in her speech that on behalf of all the workers of Quren Coal Mine, she warmly responded to the Party's call, proposing to guarantee that production, capital construction, and transportation would be increased by 50% on the existing basis, striving to double it. Li Cheng, Secretary of the CPC Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant Committee, said that the workers have already taken action and are determined to fight for the completion and overfulfillment of the production task of 13,000 tons of good steel in the second half of this year. Li Xinting, Secretary of the CPC Zengcheng County Committee, said that Zengcheng County suffered a major flood disaster in June this year that was unprecedented in a century. With soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary optimism, the people of the county threw themselves into the struggle to restore production and rebuild their homes. After two months of hard work day and night, they have successfully completed the 650,000 cubic meters of dike protection and breach plugging tasks, ensuring the irrigation of 150,000 mu of late rice fields; overfulfilled the planting plan of 800,000 mu of late rice according to the season and quality. And they have built 5,000 houses on the dilapidated ruins, so that 25% of the disaster-stricken farmers have new homes. We will resolutely respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, muster greater enthusiasm, and strive to turn the plan of "recovering two crops of grain in one crop" and "eliminating traces of the disaster area within half a year" into reality.
    Fujian:
    The workers of Fuzhou Match Factory challenged each other, determined to work hard and cleverly for four months to complete the 1962 production target three years ahead of schedule.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th: After the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were transmitted to the vast towns, villages, islands and mountainous areas of Fujian Province, the masses cheered and everywhere people cheered: "Long live the General Line!" "Long live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long live the People's Communes!"
    The workers in cities such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Nanping, and projects and construction sites such as Gutian Hydropower Station, Sanming Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, Zhangping Dakeng Coal Mine, and Zhangzhou Sugar and Paper Joint Enterprise are determined to respond to the battle call of the Party Central Committee by completing capital construction projects ahead of schedule and producing more steel, coal, electricity, sugar, paper and other products. More than 1,000 workers of Fuzhou Machine Tool Factory, which was born in the Great Leap Forward last year, just completed the August production plan ahead of schedule on the 25th by 0.3%. On the evening of the 26th, they decided to complete the annual production plan two months ahead of schedule by the end of October. The workers in each workshop of the Fuzhou Match Factory launched challenges and responses to each other. They are determined to work hard and cleverly for four months to produce 340,000 pieces of matches this year, completing the 1962 production target three years ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 30,000 pieces. The generator installation workers of the first-level phase II of Gutian Hydropower Station unanimously guaranteed to complete the installation task of 50,000 kilowatts before the end of the year and send a strong power source to Fuzhou, Nanping and other places to supply various factories and enterprises. All the workers at the construction site of Zhangzhou Sugar and Paper Joint Enterprise, which only started construction in July last year, also guaranteed to complete the capital construction and installation plan of a 6,000-kilowatt power plant and a sugar factory with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons of sugarcane one month ahead of the original plan.
    The commune members of the people's communes in the vast rural areas, remote mountainous areas, and islands are determined to continue to give full play to the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, comprehensively develop diversified economic production such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and increase the production of more grain, timber, oil and non-staple foods, and use facts to smash the slanders of domestic and foreign enemies against the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and collectivization. The people's communes in Pucheng County, known as the "Granary of Northern Fujian," have successively held mass meetings at the brigade and production team level to discuss the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and revise this year's leap forward targets. People are determined to strive to increase the total grain output by 35% compared with last year on the basis of this year's summer harvest. Qingning County Chengguan Commune, which won the title of Red Flag Commune, has further given play to the superiority of the commune's large scale, which can coordinate the commune's production and distribution, fully mobilize and rationally arrange labor. After establishing specialized agricultural and forestry production teams and implementing specialized management and mutual support, agricultural and forestry production has achieved extraordinary bumper harvests. Among them, the timber cut and transported in the first half of the year alone increased by 2% compared with the total output of the Great Leap Forward last year, and the annual production plan was overfulfilled by 0.5% six months ahead of schedule. Now they are ambitiously marching towards the goal of increasing the timber output by another 5,500 cubic meters, making the annual timber output double the original plan. More than 60,000 fishermen in the coastal fishing villages of Fuqing County were thrilled by the call of the Party Central Committee. After two days of hard work on the 26th and 27th, Xiaoguzhen Fisheries Commune overfulfilled the ten-day production plan by 125%.
    Ningxia:
    The Hui and Han nationalities are closely united and have proposed new measures to increase production and practice economy. The commune members of Honghua Commune proposed to ensure that the yield per mu of 20,000 mu of rice will increase by more than 120 jin compared with the bumper harvest of last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 30th: After listening to the broadcast of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region held forums and oath-taking meetings one after another, and proposed new measures to complete and overfulfill the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy.
    More than 400 workers in Yinchuan Wool Textile Factory proposed ten new measures to increase production and practice economy, revised the original struggle target of completing the annual output value task 100 days ahead of schedule to completing it 120 days ahead of schedule, and proposed to produce 10,000 meters more of No. 12 woolen fabric and 20,000 more jacquard blankets for the country. The workers of Yinchuan Power Plant wrote letters of determination and guarantees overnight, and made the following adjustments to the production targets: the power generation will be increased by 6.25% compared with the original plan, the total output value will be increased by 11.44% compared with the original plan, and the cost will be reduced by 24.1% compared with the original plan.
    More than 15,000 Hui and Han workers fighting at the construction site of the Qinglongxia Water Conservancy Hub Project on the Yellow River overfulfilled the monthly plan by 20% in July, and the plan for August had been completed by 87% by mid-August. Now, encouraged by the communique and resolutions, the workers are carrying out a series of preparations for the large-scale dam pouring project in September. They proposed to pour the foundation of the first diversion hub power station before the National Day.
    The Hui and Han commune members of the people's communes in the suburbs launched a major autumn production competition centered on field management. The commune members of Honghua Commune proposed a new plan to weed three times and apply fertilizer twice, ensuring that the yield per mu of 20,000 mu of rice will increase by more than 120 jin compared with the bumper harvest of last year.
    When the Party's battle call was transmitted to the mountainous areas of Guyuan, Tongxin and other areas where the Hui people live in concentrated communities, the commune members who were doing everything possible to strengthen field management and seize the autumn harvest were overjoyed. They put forward the struggle slogan of "late autumn surpassing early autumn, miscellaneous grains surpassing main grains, low yield surpassing high yield, and autumn surpassing summer," and were determined to make the mountainous areas catch up with the plains, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops.

    Encouraged by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the entire staff of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, which won the red flag factory for completing all tasks in Shenyang, quickly launched a new production upsurge. In the past two days, innovation suggestions have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. In just one day, 145 suggestions of various kinds were put forward, and 45 of them were realized on the same day. This is innovation expert Wang Fengen (second from the left), a national people's representative, and the three-in-one team studying the socketing machine to solve the key problem of producing 110,000-volt and 220,000-volt bushings.

    Under the call of the Party, the enthusiasm for production of the commune members of Jinjing Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province, is even higher. The autumn sweet potatoes they planted have been expanded from the original plan of 8,700 mu to more than 14,000 mu. In order to make the sweet potatoes high-yield, the commune members carried out meticulous management.

    亿万群众齐动手　深扎万年幸福根
    浙江：
    海宁县钱塘江公社十八个生产队决心提前实现农业发展纲要，力争单季晚稻从原来的亩产七百斤提高到九百斤。
    据新华社杭州30日电　浙江省从东海岛屿到浙西南山区，从太湖南岸到瓯江、敖江沿线的广大平原，到处在举行群众大会，人们热烈拥护中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，决心要把增产节约运动推向新的高潮，来响应党的伟大号召。
    在大跃进中新兴起来的浙江钢铁事业，去年和今年以来获得了巨大成就。广大钢铁职工收到了八届八中全会公报和决议后，斗志昂扬，订出了新的跃进指标。在浙江省最大的钢铁厂——半山钢铁厂的第一炼钢车间，工人们一听完广播就举行群众大会，决心为超额完成计划而战。26日午夜，这个车间就提前五天完成了8月份的炼钢任务，做到平均日产量比上月提高19.5％，合格率达到95％以上。工人们还提出下半年钢产量要比上半年产量提高一倍。绍兴钢铁厂27日举行了有一千二百多人参加的职工代表大会，工人们决定要提前一月完成今年钢、钢材、生铁的生产任务。
    在长达十多里的新安江水电站工地上，职工们表示要力争早日发电，来响应党中央的号召。第二工区钢筋厂和预制厂的厂际竞赛搞得更加火热。这两个厂已经分别在22日和23日完成了8月份的任务，现在，这两个厂又分别提出要提前十五天和十天完成9月份任务。
    全省公社社员们对公报和决议的公布感到欢欣鼓舞，他们同声赞扬总路线、大跃进、人民公社的巨大成就和威力。海宁县钱塘江公社四万多社员们通过“摆事实、算大账、比成绩、谈变化、看面貌”，一致肯定1958年是个特大跃进年，今年又在去年跃进的基础上向前跃进了一大步。27日上午，十八个生产队又分别召开社员大会，社员们情绪振奋，决心为提前实现十二年农业发展纲要而奋斗，并且提出要力争单季晚稻从原来的亩产七百斤提高到九百斤，双季晚稻从原来的五百斤提高到七百斤，络麻从原来的五百斤提高到六百斤。安吉县四岭生产队方桂珠小组在学习公报和决议后说：由于有了人民公社，解放了妇女劳动力，他们去年才能在高山上种出高产的水稻来，今年他们的早稻试验田又获得亩产一千七百多斤的丰收；同时也因为有了总路线、大跃进，才使他们大胆搞试验，创造出优良的成绩。
    沿海渔民对八届八中全会的公报和决议感到振奋。在舟山群岛上的虾崎公社，五千多渔民提出要秋汛超夏汛，大搞近洋下网生产，勤开洋勤张网，勤修仓，保证不溜一个潮汛。蚂蚁人民公社今年夏汛产量达到八万担，超过指标一倍多，社员们现在提出要在完成五万担秋汛产量的基础上再完成四万担，保证秋汛超夏汛。

    全省各地人民公社社员和国营综合垦殖场职工同样干劲冲天。永新县之竹、里田、泮中等公社的社员们，决定到三类禾田边去安营扎寨，边积肥边追肥，日夜突击，彻底消灭三类禾，实现晚稻一类化，确保晚稻超早稻。上饶市郊区茅家岭公社的社员们经过热烈的讨论，决定把蔬菜的亩产计划从原来的一万五千斤修订为一万八千斤。井冈山龙市公社先锋大队从27日起，便开始展开一个突击积肥运动，决心在极短期间积肥一万二千担，使连作晚稻每亩多施一次肥。
    广东：
    在千百万人民群众参加的广播大会上，中共曲仁煤矿党委书记保证生产、基建、运输在现有基础上提高50％，力争翻一番。
    据新华社广州30日电　广东省各地人民擂起了继续跃进的战鼓，坚决以实际行动响应党的八届八中全会发出的伟大号召。
    28日晚，中共广东省委和广东省人民委员会联合召开了有千百万人民群众参加收听的广播大会。中共广东省委书记、广东省省长陈郁在会上说，今年上半年，广东省同全国各地一样是一个继续跃进的局势，工农业的各种产品产量都比去年同期有很大增长。工业总产值增长了57％，原煤增长二点七倍，生铁增长十五点八倍，钢增长六倍，货运量增长了49％。农业生产虽然因早造的播种面积比去年有所减少，同时又遭到特大洪水灾害，但是早造平均单位面积产量比去年仍有所提高。目前，全省晚稻插秧面积已达三千三百七十万亩，秋薯种植面积已达七百五十万亩，播种季节比往年提早，麦苗生长得很好。陈郁说，以上材料充分证明了中共八届八中全会的决议完全正确，大跃进的伟大成绩不容否定，工作中存在的某些暂时的局部的缺点，只不过是十个指头中的一个小指头，右倾机会主义分子的攻击是没有道理的，国内外敌人的诬蔑更是徒劳的。陈郁最后代表省委、省人委号召各级党组织和人民群众，迅速掀起轰轰烈烈的群众运动，响应中共八届八中全会的号召。
    中共广东省委书记兼海南区党委第一书记林李明和中共广州市委书记、广州市副市长梁湘也在会上讲了话。中共曲仁煤矿党委书记张义梅在讲话中，代表曲仁煤矿全体职工热烈响应党的号召，提出保证生产、基建、运输在现有的基础上提高50％，力争翻一番。广州钢铁厂党委书记李成说，工人们已经行动起来，决心为完成和超额完成今年下半年一万三千吨好钢的生产任务而奋战。中共增城县委书记李辛亭说，增城县在今年6月间，遭受着百年一遇的特大洪水灾害。全县人民以冲天的干劲和革命乐观主义精神，投入了恢复生产和重建家园的斗争，经过两个月来的日夜苦战，已胜利地完成了六十五万土方的护堤堵口任务，保证晚造十五万亩农田的灌溉；按季节、按质量超额完成了晚造八十万亩的种植计划。并且在破烂不堪的废墟上修建了五千间房屋，使25％的受灾农民已经有了新的家园。我们坚决响应八中全会的号召，鼓起更大的干劲，力争“一造收回两造粮”、“半年内消灭灾区痕迹”的计划变成现实。
    福建：

    据新华社福州30日电　中共八届八中全会的公报和决议传到福建省广大城镇、乡村、海岛和山区后，万众欢腾，人们到处欢呼：“总路线万岁！”“大跃进万岁！”“人民公社万岁！”
    福州、厦门、漳州、南平等城市和古田水电站、三明钢铁联合企业、漳平大坑煤矿和漳州糖纸联合企业等工程、工地的工人群众，决心要用提前完成基建工程、生产更多的钢铁、煤、电力和糖、纸等产品来响应党中央的战斗号召。在去年大跃进中诞生的福州机床厂一千多名职工，刚在25日提前六天超额0.3％完成8月份生产计划，26日晚上他们又决定要在10月底提前两个月完成全年生产计划。福州火柴厂各车间职工互相展开挑应战，他们决心要苦干巧干四个月，在今年生产三十四万件火柴，提前三年超额三万件完成1962年生产指标。古田水电站一级二期发电机安装工人一致保证要提前在年底以前完成五万瓩的安装任务，把强大电力源源送往福州、南平等地，供应各工厂企业。去年7月才动工兴建的漳州糖纸联合企业工地的全体职工，也保证要比原订计划提前一个月完成六千瓩的电厂、日榨二千吨甘蔗的糖厂的基建和安装计划。
    广大农村和偏僻山区、海岛的各人民公社社员，决心要继续发挥人民公社的无比优越性，全面发展农林牧副渔等多种经济生产，增产更多的粮食、木材、油料和副食品，用事实来粉碎国内外敌人对党的总路线、大跃进、公社化的污蔑。被称为“闽北谷仓”的浦城县各人民公社纷纷以大队和生产队为单位召开群众大会，讨论八中全会决议、修订今年的跃进指标，人们决心要在今年夏季大丰收的基础上，争取全年粮食产量比去年增产35％。荣获红旗社称号的清宁县城关公社，今年以来又进一步发挥公社规模大、可以统筹全社生产和分配、充分动员和合理安排劳力等优越性，建立了农、林业生产专业队，实行专业经营和相互支援以后，农林业生产都获得了特大丰收。其中仅是上半年砍运的木材就比大跃进的去年全年产量增加了2％，提前半年超额0.5％完成了全年生产计划，现在他们又雄心勃勃地在向多增产五千五百立方米木材的目标进军，使全年木材产量比原订计划再翻一番。福清县沿海渔村六万多渔民对党中央的号召感到欢欣鼓舞，小古镇渔业公社经过26、27日两天奋战后，超额125％完成了十天生产计划。
