Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 19th: According to the "Laotian Patriotic News" of September 12th, the people in the central and northern provinces of Laos are resolutely resisting the suppression and "mopping-up" operations by the Sananikone government.

	In Phongsaly, the Sananikone government troops, when conducting a "mopping-up" operation in the Sonao area on September 4th, were intercepted by the people's armed self-defense forces in the Naxon area. Two companies of Sananikone's troops were disarmed. On the same day, in Luang Prabang Province, Laotian government troops searched, looted, and arrested people in Beisang, encountering guerrilla resistance twice. The Sananikone government troops, who attempted to arrest former resistance members in the villages of Namei, Bengao, and Bengwang on September 6th, were also badly defeated by the guerrillas.

	The people in the Mang Xian stronghold area have laid mines and dug traps around the stronghold to cut off the lines of communication and support for the Sananikone government troops.

	In Sam Neua Province, after the Laotian government troops were forced to withdraw from the strongholds of Mang He and Chuan Kuang on August 31st, the government troops in the strongholds of Suobao, Mang Heng, and Suohao also abandoned their strongholds and fled on September 1st. Thus, the entire system used by Sananikone in Ma Giang to control and "mop up" the people in the Chuan Kuang area has been completely shattered.

	In Vientiane Province, due to the counterattack of the people's armed forces, the government troops stationed in Subang were forced to withdraw from their stronghold on September 6th.

	In Xieng Khouang Province, the people have eliminated two local pro-American reactionary leaders, one of whom was a military officer who was killed while attempting to rape a woman in Falun, and the other was a deputy county chief who was killed while escorting some arrested people to Xieng Khouang Province.

	In central Laos, the people in many places in Khammouane and Savannakhet provinces have organized guerrillas to defend their homes; young people are enthusiastically joining the army. The Sananikone government army's "self-defense" organizations have been dissolved, and many "self-defense" members have joined the guerrillas. The people are digging traps, storing grain, and carrying out strict anti-espionage and "special forces" work. In the face of the people's resolute struggle, many Laotian government troops have resisted orders to carry out "mopping-up" operations and have fled their strongholds to join the ranks of the people.

    坚决抗击政府军的残暴镇压
    老挝中北部人民奋起自卫
    新华社河内19日电　据9月12日的“老挝爱国新闻”报道：老挝中寮、北寮各省人民正在坚决抗击萨纳尼空政府的镇压和扫荡。
    在丰沙里的萨纳尼空政府军，9月4日到索瑙地区扫荡时，在纳松地区遭到人民武装自卫队的阻击。萨纳尼空的两个连被解除了武装。同一天，在琅勃拉邦省，老挝政府军到北桑搜索、抢劫和抓人，两次遭到游击队的阻击。9月6日到纳美、奔高、奔王这些村庄逮捕前抗战人员的萨纳尼空政府军也被游击队打得落花流水。
    芒险据点地区的人民，在这个据点周围埋设地雷，挖掘陷井，来截断萨纳尼空政府军的联络和支援路线。
    在桑怒省，老挝政府军在8月31日被迫撤出芒赫、川库据点后，9月1日，在索包、芒亨、索毫据点的政府军也丢下了据点逃走。至此，萨纳尼空在马江用来控制、“扫荡”川库地区人民的整个系统已经完全被粉碎。
    在万象省，由于人民武装的反击，驻在苏榜的政府军在9月6日被迫撤出据点。
    在川圹省，人民已经消灭了当地的两名亲美的反动头子，其中一名是军官，他在发伦企图强奸妇女的时候被击毙，另一名是副县长，在他把一些被捕的人民押送到川圹省的途中被击毙。
    在中寮，甘蒙和沙湾拿吉两省许多地方的人民组织了保卫家乡的游击队；青年们踊跃地参军。萨纳尼空政府军的“自卫队”组织都被解散，许多“自卫队”员加入了游击队。人民正在挖掘陷井，收藏粮食和进行严防间谍、“别动队”的工作。在人民坚决的斗争面前，许多老挝政府军抗拒执行“扫荡”的命令，并逃出据点，站到人民的队伍里来。
