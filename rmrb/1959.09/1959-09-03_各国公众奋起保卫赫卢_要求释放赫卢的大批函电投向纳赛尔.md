Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, September 1st. According to a report in "Al Nida" on September 1st, the movement to rescue Lebanese Communist leader Farajallah Helou is receiving increasingly widespread support from the public in Lebanon and other countries.

The newspaper reported that the Venezuelan Communist Party's newspaper "Tribuna Popular" published an article calling for "saving Comrade Helou's life."

"Al Nida" said that nine members of the Venezuelan parliament have telegraphed the Minister of Interior of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic, Sarraj, protesting the arrest of Helou. The telegram stated, "We demand respect for the dignity of Helou, the great Lebanese people's fighter, as a human being, and his immediate release."

The newspaper said that in France, the movement to rescue Helou is expanding. Communists and democrats in Cantal, France, said in a telegram to UAR President Nasser that Helou's arrest and the torture he has suffered "violate all principles of freedom and democracy." "Al Nida" also reported that the newspaper's editorial department receives large numbers of telegrams and letters from Arab immigrants abroad every day, protesting the arrest of Helou by the UAR authorities and expressing concern for his life. Twenty-five Arab immigrants in Brazil jointly sent a telegram to Nasser and the UAR Syrian Region Interior Minister Sarraj, stating that the blatant kidnapping of Helou on the streets of Damascus "is a blow to the struggle of the Arab peoples against imperialism and Zionism." The telegram said that this rash arrest "is a violation of the Declaration of Human Rights." The telegram requested that they order the cessation of torture and release him.

"Al Nida" reported that the Swedish Democratic Youth Organization, the Norwegian Communist Youth League, and the Uruguayan Communist Youth Union have also telegraphed the UAR authorities demanding Helou's release.

The "New World News" and "Al Telegraf" here have also published telegrams they received from southern Lebanon demanding Helou's release. One of the telegrams received by "New World News" was signed by 250 people.

    各国公众奋起保卫赫卢
    要求释放赫卢的大批函电投向纳赛尔
    新华社贝鲁特1日电　据“呼声报”1日报道，营救黎巴嫩共产党领袖法拉贾拉·赫卢的运动得到黎巴嫩和其他国家公众越来越广泛的支持。
    这家报纸报道，委内瑞拉共产党机关报“人民论坛报”发表文章，号召“援救赫卢同志的生命”。
    “呼声报”说，委内瑞拉的九名议员已经打电报给阿联叙利亚地区内政部长萨拉杰，抗议逮捕赫卢。电报说，“我们要求尊重黎巴嫩伟大的人民战士赫卢的作为一个人的尊严，并且立即释放他。”
    这家报纸说，在法国，援救赫卢的运动正在扩大。法国坎塔地方的共产党人和民主人士在打给阿联总统纳赛尔的电报中说，赫卢的被捕以及他所遭到的酷刑“违背了自由民主的一切原则。”“呼声报”还报道，这家报纸的编辑部每天都收到国外阿拉伯移民的大批电报和信件，抗议阿联当局逮捕赫卢，并且对他的生命表示担心。在巴西的二十五个阿拉伯移民联名打给纳赛尔和阿联叙利亚地区内政部长萨拉杰的一份电报说，公然在大马士革街头绑架赫卢的做法“是对阿拉伯各国人民在反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义斗争中的一次打击”。电报说，这种轻率的逮捕“是违反人权宣言的。”电报要求他们下令停止拷问赫卢并且释放他。
    “呼声报”报道，瑞典民主青年组织、挪威共产主义青年团和乌拉圭的共产主义青年联盟也打电报给阿联当局，要求释放赫卢。
    这里的“新世界报”和“电讯报”也登载了它们收到的从黎巴嫩南部打来的要求释放赫卢的电报。“新世界报”收到的电报中有一份有二百五十人署名。
