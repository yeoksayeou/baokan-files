"Red Army Regiment" Intensifies Tactical Training

    All officers and soldiers of the "Red Army Regiment" of our 0057 unit stationed on the Yunnan border, discussed the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the resolution on launching a movement to increase production and practice economy with excitement. Comrades unanimously believe that the Eighth Plenary Session issued a battle call to the whole party and the whole people to oppose right-leaning, encourage vigor, and complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year, which is very correct and timely. We resolutely respond to this call and are determined to fight hard in September and launch a leaping high tide centered on tactical training. The unit has decided to conduct the originally scheduled company tactical training subjects on September 1st ahead of schedule. Now, everyone has taken action. Battalion Commander Zhao Jisheng led comrades to the field to write teaching plans. After discussing the communique and resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session, the officers and soldiers of the first and second detachments who were supporting the autumn harvest in the commune braved the rain the next day to help the commune harvest rice and cotton. Everyone was full of fighting spirit and launched a labor competition to compare work efficiency and quality, ensuring that they would cut well, thresh well, and harvest well, returning every grain to the home.

    “红军团”加紧战术训练
    我们驻在云南边疆的0057部队“红军团”全体官兵，以满怀兴奋的心情，讨论了中共八届八中全会公报和关于开展增产节约运动的决议。同志们一致认为：八中全会向全党全民发出反右倾、鼓干劲，提前在今年内完成第二个五年计划主要指标的战斗号召，是非常正确和适时的。我们坚决响应这一号召，决心大战9月，掀起一个以战术训练为中心的跃进高潮。部队已决定将原来预定的连队战术训练课目，提前在9月1日进行。现在，大家已经行动起来，营长赵继胜同志带领同志到野外去写教案。正在支援公社秋收的一、二分队的官兵们，座谈了八中全会公报和决议以后，在第二天就冒雨帮助公社抢收稻谷和棉花，个个斗志昂扬，开展了比工效、比质量的劳动竞赛。保证做到割好、打好、收好，颗粒还家。　高其良
