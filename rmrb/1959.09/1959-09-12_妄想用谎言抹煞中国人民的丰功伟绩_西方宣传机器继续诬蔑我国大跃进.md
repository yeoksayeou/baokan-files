Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: Western imperialist countries, primarily the United States, propagandists continue to use their strange imaginations regarding the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC. They are elatedly spreading all kinds of rumors and slanders about China's Great Leap Forward, people's communes, and the mass steelmaking movement. They are attempting to use their written lies to erase the great achievements made by the Chinese people with their own hands during the Great Leap Forward. However, their efforts are like a mayfly trying to shake a big tree. Not only will they not diminish the slightest of the Chinese people's enormous achievements, but on the contrary, they will arouse the Chinese people's anger and cause them to respond to imperialist rumors and slander with even greater achievements.

The U.S. government's propaganda machine, the United States Information Service, once again trotted out the tired old tune on September 7 in a dispatch from Hong Kong, harping that China's verified production figures from last year were still "unreliable." It insisted that "there is no reason to believe that future (Chinese) statistics and statements will be more credible than the figures and statements announced during the 'Great Leap Forward'," and falsely claimed that China's statistics and statements for the first half of 1959 "still appear to be extremely exaggerated." This mouthpiece of the U.S. government also nonsensically said that the CPC's "practice of admitting errors in the Central Committee's communique is a serious challenge to the concept that the Party does not make mistakes," and falsely accused that "attempting to attribute responsibility to 'hostile elements' and 'right-leaning elements' is a typical Communist tactic."

"New York Times" Hong Kong correspondent, Robert Trumbull, recently published a series of articles, fabricating that Chinese "refugees are continuously arriving in Hong Kong" and saying that this proves "the grain shortage in China is serious," and that "many of the lowered 1958 agricultural figures are still probably higher than actual production." This servant of American monopoly capital propagandized that the agricultural situation in our country in the first half of this year was "not so satisfactory."

The British "Economist" magazine published an article on September 7 entitled "China Bites the Bullet," slandering the communique of our Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC, saying, "Based on this surprising document, it can be assumed that either the Chinese people are very forgetful, or no one can tell the difference between a leap and a jump." This magazine even pretended to be serious and nonsensically said that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party have been uneasily dealing with "the consequences of their own-made" "human stupidity" for two months. The CPC "Central Committee has now made many implicit criticisms of the communes… and no longer expects the communes to make any significant contribution to China's industrial production."

The Paris "French Observer" weekly also made various delirious remarks about China's verification of last year's industrial and agricultural output in an article on September 3. It said that this was a "sudden steadiness of Chinese decision-makers." It falsely accused that the political command in various tasks in China "disregards natural conditions and economic backwardness" and "means that economic factors are placed in a secondary position."

The imperialist propaganda machine vainly attempts to erase the great achievements of China's socialist construction and weaken our country's great influence among the people of all countries in the world through means of rumor-mongering and slander. The United States Information Service clamored that "Beijing's prestige has suffered in Asia due to the failure of its economic plans." The British "Economist" magazine wrote triumphantly, "No matter how diluted the wording of the Central Committee's admission of failure is, this action cannot but be a shock to those Asians who tend to think that China's experience is an example of rapid economic development."

### 妄想用谎言抹煞中国人民的丰功伟绩  西方宣传机器继续诬蔑我国大跃进

    妄想用谎言抹煞中国人民的丰功伟绩
    西方宣传机器继续诬蔑我国大跃进
    据新华社11日讯　西方帝国主义国家，首先是美帝国主义的宣传家们，继续运用他们稀奇古怪的想像力，就中共八届八中全会的公报和决议，得意忘形地对中国的大跃进、人民公社和全民炼钢运动，发出形形色色的造谣污蔑。企图用他们笔下的谎言来抹杀中国人民在大跃进中用自己的双手立下的丰功伟迹。但是，他们的这种努力就像蜉蝣撼大树一样，不但无损中国人民的巨大成就的分毫，相反，却会激起中国人民的愤怒和用更大的成就来回答帝国主义的造谣污蔑。
    美国政府的宣传机器——美国新闻处7日自香港发出的一条消息中再一次大弹中国核实过的去年的生产数字仍然“不可靠”的滥调。它硬说，“没有理由认为，今后（中国）的统计数字和各种说法会比‘大跃进’中所宣布的数字和说法更可信”，并且造谣说，中国1959年上半年的统计数字和说法“看上去仍然是极为夸大的。”这个美国政府的喉舌还胡说什么中共“中央委员会公报承认错误的做法是对党不会犯错误这种观念的一种严重诘难”，并诬蔑说，“设法把责任归到‘敌对分子’和‘右倾分子’头上一贯是共产党的典型做法。”
    “纽约时报”驻香港记者窦丁最近连续发表文章，捏造说中国“难民源源到达香港”并说这证明“中国的缺粮现象是严重的”，“连降低后的1958年农业数字有许多大概仍然高于实际产量”。这个美国垄断资本的奴仆宣传我国今年上半年的农业情况“并不那么令人满意”。
    英国“经济学家”杂志7日发表一篇题为“中国忍痛估计情况”的文章，诬蔑我八中全会的公报说，“根据这一惊人的文件可以假定，不是中国人民很健忘，就是没有人能够说出跃进和蹦跳有什么区别”。这家杂志竟煞有介事地胡说中国共产党领袖们两个月以来一直在不安地应付“他们自己造成的”“人类愚蠢行为的后果”。中共“中央委员会现在对公社已经提出了许多隐约的批评……也不再期望公社会对中国工业产量作出什么显著贡献了”。
    巴黎的“法兰西观察家”周刊在9月3日的一篇文章中也对中国核实去年工农业产量发出各种呓语，它说什么这是“中国决策人骤然稳健起来”。它诬蔑中国各项工作中的政治挂帅是“不顾自然条件和经济落后状态”，“意味着经济因素被放到次要地位”。
    帝国主义宣传机器妄想以造谣诽谤的手段，抹杀中国社会主义建设伟大的成就，削弱我国在世界各国人民中巨大的影响。美国新闻处叫嚷“北平的威信由于经济计划的失败而在亚洲受到了损失”。英国“经济学家”杂志得意洋洋地写道，“中央委员会的承认失败无论措词怎样被冲淡，可是这一行动对那些倾向于认为中国的经验是经济迅速发展的榜样的亚洲人来说，却不能不是一个震动。”
