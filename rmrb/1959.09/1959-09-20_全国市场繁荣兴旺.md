Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Thanks to the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the People's Communes, our country's domestic market is presenting a thriving and prosperous scene. In the first seven months of this year, the total retail sales of commodities increased by 20.7% compared with the same period last year, commercial inventory increased by 23.2%. The supply of the vast majority of sixty major commodities increased by 20% to more than 100%, and the situation of insufficient supply of a few commodities such as pork has begun to improve.

Under the new situation of the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, our country's domestic market presents a thriving scene. In the first half of this year, especially since July, the supply of most daily necessities and non-staple foods has increased, urban and rural savings have increased, commercial inventory has increased, prices have remained basically stable, and the purchase of major agricultural and sideline products has been good. All this powerfully proves that the "overall tension in market supply" mentioned by some people is groundless.

In the first seven months of this year, the total retail sales of commodities nationwide increased by 20.7% compared with the same period last year, of which the retail sales of sixty major commodities in the first half of the year increased by 19% compared with the same period last year. Among these sixty commodities, except for a few commodities such as pork and fresh eggs, other commodities generally increased by 20%-30%, some increased by 40%-50%, and some even increased by more than 100%. If we look at grain, non-staple food, and daily industrial products (including handicrafts) separately, the situation is as follows:

Grain: The sales volume of grain from January to August this year increased by 13.6% compared with the same period last year. In areas affected by floods and droughts, the state, in addition to organizing the masses to produce for self-rescue, also allocated a portion of grain to support the people through the famine.

Vegetables, aquatic products, and fruits among non-staple foods have all increased to varying degrees in production and supply since the beginning of this year. According to statistics from fourteen cities including Beijing and Tianjin, the sown area of spring and summer vegetables this year increased by more than 70% compared with the same period last year. According to statistics from sixty-three cities in the north, the sown area of autumn vegetables also increased by 90% compared with 1958. Therefore, the supply of vegetables in most areas has increased significantly. From January to July, the supply of vegetables in thirteen large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Harbin was 3.2 billion catties, an increase of 39% compared with 2.3 billion catties in the same period in 1958, and many cities reached one catty of vegetables per person per day. A large city like Shanghai, with a population of seven million, has completely achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables this year, and has also transferred nearly 100 million catties of vegetables to support other areas from January to July. Only a few cities such as Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Beijing were affected by floods and droughts, and vegetable production and supply were affected for a period of time, but after the local leading departments mobilized the masses to rescue and the state allocated support, the situation has improved. Thanks to the efforts of all fishermen, a total of 2.11 million tons of various aquatic products were caught from January to July this year, an increase of about 10% compared with the same period last year. State-owned commercial departments supplied 119,000 tons of aquatic products to the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin from January to August, an increase of 12% compared with the same period in 1958. The market supply of aquatic products in a few cities has decreased due to the increase in the amount consumed by rural areas themselves. This year's watermelons, peaches, apricots, pears and other fruits have been harvested in abundance everywhere, and the market supply of melons and fruits is more abundant than in previous years. By mid-August, the three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai had supplied 300 million catties of watermelon, an increase of two-thirds compared with the supply for the entire year last year. After the summer grain was put on the market, the supply of pastries has also been greatly improved.

After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the principle of raising both publicly and privately, the production of live pigs and poultry has gradually increased. The number of poultry on hand at the end of June reached 660 million, more than double the number at the end of February. The number of live pigs in many areas has increased compared with the end of last year. As of the end of June, Heilongjiang Province had raised 3.4 million live pigs, an increase of 140,000 compared with the end of last year. At the end of June this year, Liaoning Province also increased by 250,000 pigs compared with the end of last year. Many cities have conscientiously implemented the policy of "relying mainly on self-reliance and striving for foreign aid as a supplement," vigorously developing the production of live pigs and poultry in the suburbs of cities, and organizations and groups have also raised pigs and chickens. The enthusiasm of commune members for raising pigs individually is also very high, which has created conditions for further improving the supply of meat. At present, the supply of meat in many cities and industrial and mining areas has increased. The supply of fresh pork, chickens and ducks in Shanghai in July and August increased by 7% and 50% respectively compared with May and June. The supply of meat in the key cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by 50% in August compared with July, and the planned supply in September increased by more than 30% compared with August. If the supply for the Mid-Autumn Festival is included, it will increase by more than 100%.

The situation of daily industrial products is even better. According to statistics from the Ministry of Light Industry, from January to July this year, the output of major light industrial products increased compared with the same period last year: cameras, watches, alcohol, wind instruments, etc. increased by more than 100%; machine-made paper and cardboard, sugar, enamel, washbasins, gold pens, pencils, clocks, wine, etc. increased by 30% to 50%; salt, edible oil, soap, thermos bottles, etc. increased by more than 10%, and cigarettes and matches also increased.

With the development of production, the market supply of daily industrial products has also increased significantly compared with the past. Compared with the same period last year, in the first eight months of this year, the sales volume of cotton cloth increased by 38.3%, rubber shoes increased by 37.4%, wool yarn increased by 44.7%, cigarettes increased by 26.3%, soap increased by 25.9%, and fountain pens increased by about 100%. The situation of small commodities, which once experienced tight market supply, quickly improved after the Party committees at all levels implemented the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to vigorously restore and develop handicraft production. At present, the supply of small commodities such as pots, bowls, ladles, basins, knives, scissors, hairpins, brushes, steamers, and pacifiers has increased greatly. The number of commodities operated by the Beijing Department Store Wholesale Company increased from more than 14,000 at the end of March to more than 21,000. At the end of July, the Tianjin Department Store operated more than 1,700 more varieties of small commodities than at the end of March. At the Second National Third Category Commodity Exchange Conference recently jointly held by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Light Industry, the local products and handicraft products that various places requested to sell reached 309 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 times compared with the First National Third Category Commodity Exchange Conference. This fact also vividly reflects the vigorous development of handicraft production in various places.

While increasing production, organizations and groups at all levels and the vast urban and rural people enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to practice strict economy. Many organizations reduced expenditures that could be reduced, reduced and stopped purchases that were dispensable, and many urban and rural residents developed the fine style of diligence and thrift in managing their households. Therefore, administrative management expenses were reduced and urban and rural savings increased. The administrative management expenses of various organizations and institutions nationwide decreased by 12.8% in June compared with May, decreased by 10.5% in July compared with June, and decreased by 4% in the first ten days of August compared with the first ten days of July. In August, national savings deposits increased by 80 million yuan, an increase of 100% compared with the savings amount increased in July. Among these savings deposits, the proportion of fixed deposits is gradually increasing.

Due to the development of production, the purchase of goods by commercial departments increased, and various organizations and groups automatically saved administrative expenses. Therefore, the inventory of commercial departments increased, and the materials held by the state became more abundant. At the end of July, the inventory of commercial departments nationwide increased by 23.2% compared with the same period last year.

In the first half of this year, prices across the country were basically stable. The price levels of commodities such as grain, edible oil, salt, cotton cloth, coal, and kerosene, which are of great importance to people's lives and play a decisive role in the market, have not changed. Only a few non-staple foods and handicrafts, once because production could not keep up with the growth of social needs, and some were affected by rising raw material prices, their prices rose slightly, but after the development of handicraft production and diversified rural operations, the prices of these products have fallen.

The purchase of agricultural and sideline products is also very good. The purchase progress of early rice and wheat is generally more than half a month faster than last year. On the basis of bumper agricultural harvests, the purchase volume has increased significantly compared with the same period last year.

The above situation shows that the overall situation of our country's domestic market is good. However, our country is a large country with a population of more than 600 million. On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, urban and rural purchasing power is constantly increasing, but the speed of production development cannot keep up with the speed of purchasing power growth. Therefore, the supply of a few commodities is still relatively tight. At present, inspired by the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole country are engaged in a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy while opposing rightism and encouraging enthusiasm. With the development of this movement, the national market will surely become more prosperous and thriving.

### 全国市场繁荣兴旺

    归功于大跃进　归功于人民公社
    全国市场繁荣兴旺
    今年头七个月商品零售额比去年同期增长20.7％，商业库存增长23.2％
    六十种主要商品绝大多数增长二成到一倍以上，猪肉等少数商品供应不足的状况已开始改善
    新华社19日讯　在工农业生产继续跃进的新形势下，我国国内市场呈现了一片欣欣向荣的兴旺景象。今年上半年，特别是7月份以来，大部分日用百货和副食品供应量增多，城乡储蓄额上升，商业库存增加，物价基本稳定，主要农产品和副产品收购情况良好。这一切都有力地证明了有些人所说的“市场供应全面紧张”是毫无根据的。
    今年头七个月，全国商品零售总额比去年同期增长20.7％，其中六十种主要商品上半年的零售额比去年同期增长19％。这六十种商品中除猪肉、鲜蛋等少数商品外，其他商品一般都增长20％—30％，有的增长40％—50％，还有的增长一倍以上。如果分别按粮食、副食品、日用工业品（包括手工业品）来看，则有如下情况：
    粮食，今年1月至8月份的粮食销售量比去年同期增长了13.6％。水旱灾害的地区，国家除组织群众生产自救外，还拨出一部分粮食支援人民度过灾荒。
    副食品中的蔬菜、水产、水果，今年以来生产和供应都有程度不同的增长。据北京、天津等十四个城市统计，今年春夏菜的播种面积比去年同期增加了70％以上。又据北方六十三个城市的统计，秋菜播种面积也比1958年增长了90％。因此大多数地区蔬菜供应量有较大的增长。1月至7月份，上海、天津、北京、哈尔滨等十三个大中城市的蔬菜供应量为三十二亿斤，比1958年同期的二十三亿斤增加39％，不少城市达到每人每天一斤菜。像上海这样一个拥有七百万人口的大城市，今年已经完全做到了蔬菜自给自足，1月至7月份还调出了近一亿斤蔬菜支援外地。只有广州、武汉、北京等少数城市由于遭到水旱灾害，蔬菜生产和供应在一段时间内受到影响，但是经过当地领导部门发动群众抢救和国家调拨支援后，情况已经改善。由于全体渔民的努力，今年1月至7月份共捕捞各种水产品二百十一万吨，比去年同期增长10％左右。国营商业部门1月至8月份共供应北京、上海、天津三大城市水产品十一万九千吨，比1958年同期增长12％。少数城市水产品的上市量，由于农村自己消费的数量增加，有些减少。今年的西瓜、桃、杏、梨等水果，各地都获得了丰收，市场瓜果供应量比往年充裕。北京、天津、上海三大城市到8月中旬已供应西瓜三亿斤，比去年全年的供应量增加了三分之二。夏粮上市以后，糕点的供应情况也已大大改善。
    在中共中央提出公养和私养并举的方针以后，生猪家禽生产已经逐步提高。家禽6月底的存栏数已达到六亿六千万只，比2月底增加一倍以上。不少地区的生猪比去年年底增加。黑龙江省截至6月底，已饲养生猪三百四十万头，比去年年底增加十四万头。辽宁省今年6月底也比去年年底增加了二十五万头猪。许多城市都认真贯彻了“自力更生为主，力争外援为辅”的方针，在城市郊区大力发展生猪家禽生产，机关团体也纷纷养猪喂鸡，社员个人养猪的积极性也很高涨，这些都为进一步改善肉食供应创造了条件。目前不少城市和工矿区肉食供应量已经增加。上海市7、8月份供应的鲜猪肉和鸡鸭分别比5、6月份上升7％和50％。内蒙古自治区各重点城市和工矿区林区的肉食供应量，8月份比7月份增加50％，9月份计划供应的数量又比8月份增加30％以上，如果连同中秋节的供应量计算在内，则增加一倍以上。
    日用工业品的情况更加良好。据轻工业部统计，今年1月至7月份，轻工业主要产品产量比去年同期增长的情况是：照相机、手表、酒精、管乐器等增长一倍以上；机制纸及纸板、食糖、搪瓷、面盆、金笔、铅笔、钟、酒等增长30％到50％；盐、食油、肥皂、热水瓶等增长10％以上，卷烟、火柴也有所增加。
    随着生产的发展，市场日用工业品的供应量也比过去显著增加。与去年同期比较，今年头八个月棉布销售量增长了38.3％，胶鞋增长37.4％，毛线增长44.7％，香烟增长26.3％，肥皂增长25.9％，自来水笔增加了一倍左右。曾经一度发生市场供应紧张的小商品，自从各级党委贯彻了中共中央大力恢复和发展手工业生产的指示后，情况很快好转。目前市场上锅、碗、瓢、盆、刀剪、发卡、刷子、笼屉、奶嘴等小商品供应量已经大大增加。北京市百货批发公司经营的商品由3月底的一万四千多种增加到二万一千多种。天津市百货公司7月底经营的小百货品种比三月底增加了一千七百多种。在商业部和轻工业部最近联合召开的全国第二次第三类商品交流会上，各地要求出售的土产品和手工业产品达三亿零九千万元，比全国第一次第三类商品交流会增加了一点三倍，这个事实也生动地反映了各地手工业生产蓬勃发展的情况。
    在增加生产的同时，各级机关团体和广大城乡人民热烈响应党的厉行节约的号召，许多机关削减了可以削减的开支，减少和停止了可有可无的购置，不少城乡居民发扬了勤俭持家的优良风气，因此行政管理费用缩减，城乡储蓄增加。全国各机关事业单位的行政管理费6月份比5月份减少了12.8％，7月份又比6月份减少了10.5％，8月上旬比7月上旬又减少4％。8月份全国储蓄存款增加了八千万元，比7月份增加的储蓄额上升一倍。在这些储蓄存款中，定期储蓄所占的比重逐渐扩大。
    由于生产的发展，商业部门进货增加，各机关团体又自动节约行政费用，因此商业部门库存上升，国家掌握的物资更加雄厚。7月末全国商业部门的库存比去年同期增长23.2％。
    今年上半年，全国物价基本上是稳定的。与人民生活关系重大并且在市场上起决定作用的粮食、食油、盐、棉布、煤炭、煤油等商品的价格水平都没有变动。只有少数副食品和手工业品，一度因为生产赶不上社会需要的增长，有的受原料涨价的影响，价格略有上升，但是在手工业生产和农村多种经营发展起来以后，这些产品的价格已经回落。
    农副产品收购情况也很好，早稻和小麦的收购进度一般都比去年加快了半个多月。在农业大丰收的基础上，收购量比去年同期有较大的增长。
    以上种种情况说明，我国国内市场总的情况是良好的。但是，我国是一个六亿多人口的大国，在工农业生产发展的基础上，城乡购买力不断提高，而生产发展的速度还赶不上购买力增长的速度，因此有少数商品的供应还比较紧张。目前全国人民在中共八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，正在反右倾、鼓干劲，展开轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，随着这一运动的发展，全国市场情况必将进一步繁荣兴旺。
