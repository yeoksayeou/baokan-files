    British Parliamentary Elections
    Soviet Union, G. Malishev
    Traditionally, autumn has always been a season of political storms in Britain. This autumn has arrived slightly earlier than usual. As early as mid-August, the holiday mood of British MPs and party workers was disrupted. Members of the House of Commons had learned that they would have to go to the British Parliament Buildings to hear the government's decision to dissolve Parliament. Leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties' local organizations had received instructions to return to their constituencies no later than mid-September.
    Finally, on September 8, the election date for the House of Commons was officially announced. The election was scheduled for October 8. The term of the current Parliament would end in May 1960. Therefore, the election would be designated to be held before that date.
    Although the parliamentary election was announced only three to four weeks before the election day, which gave the ruling Conservative Party a certain advantage, this "sudden factor" was reduced to a minimum. It turned out that the campaign had in fact already begun before the official announcement of the election date, that is, in early 1959. Campaign manifestos, pamphlets, and programmatic statements distributed by the headquarters of the major political parties flooded the entire country. Labourites issued more than a dozen different documents on domestic and foreign policy issues one after another: from general declarations such as "The Future Offered to You by Labour Party Members" to plans for health care and recreation.
    For every document issued by the Labour Party, the Conservatives distributed counter-propaganda pamphlets with tit-for-tat measures. They also announced their own campaign platforms. They also printed a large number of declarations on organizing recreation and colorful pamphlets praising the activities of Conservative Party leaders.
    This time, the Liberal Party also distributed a large number of leaflets and was unusually active.
    Both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party attached great importance to the preparation of the campaign. For example, the Conservatives decided to redraw the boundaries of forty constituencies where the Labour Party still had strong strength until now.
    The Labourites used great efforts to eliminate the weaknesses in their own organizational work. They believed that this was the main reason for the Labour Party's failure in the last two elections. They had strengthened local branches with experienced and motivating workers. The party's executive committee meetings had discussed the progress of election preparations several times, and at one such meeting it was also decided to conduct a "National Member Recruitment Week" in September.
    Through so many organizational measures that were discussed and formulated, the Labour Party leadership felt confident.
    The party's general secretary, Morgan Phillips, stated at an executive committee meeting that "We will not be caught off guard." Bevan said at a press conference in Moscow on September 7: "Labour Party members have many chances to win. We are starting the campaign with great confidence in our own strength..."
    But Conservative activists also had confidence in their victory. The British press even believed that the Conservative Party had more opportunities to use tactical means. First of all, they believed that the British economic situation was favorable to Macmillan's party. The decline in production last year had stopped. Of course, there are still signs of economic instability, for example, the number of unemployed increased again in August. However, the unemployment figures are lower than last year and even this spring, when the British government decided to postpone the election. At the end of this year, the economic situation is expected to deteriorate again. This forced the Conservatives to announce the election in a hurry.
    In addition, Macmillan's visit to Moscow and his support for holding a "summit conference" enhanced his personal prestige, which was also beneficial to the Conservative Party. In British public opinion, the proposal to ease international tensions and stop the Cold War currently holds an overwhelming advantage. The Conservatives have estimated this sentiment. On August 15, the "Daily Herald Tribune" asserted that one of the main slogans that the Conservatives would put forward to voters would be: "Defend Macmillan for the sake of the summit."
    For the sake of the campaign, the Macmillan government had already decided on several measures to be implemented this autumn as early as this summer. What is particularly referred to here is slightly increasing pension allowances and adjusting tax rates, etc. When the House of Commons discussed these draft legislations, the Labour Party members directly called these legislations "election bait."
    Finally, the Conservative Party also pinned its hopes on the divisions within the Labour Party. When trade unions and Labour Party organizations began to seriously discuss the issue of nuclear weapons this summer, serious differences emerged in the attitudes of the Labour Party's executive committee and some large trade unions towards this issue. The Labour Party's executive committee stated its views in a lengthy document entitled "Disarmament and Nuclear War, the Next Step to Take." However, contrary to the leadership's expectations, this document aroused dissatisfaction among many ordinary Labour Party members. When issuing the statement, the Labour Party's executive committee also completely ignored the public's demands for the withdrawal of American atomic rocket bases from Britain and the prohibition of American bombers carrying atomic bombs from flying in British airspace. Its initiative to establish a so-called "non-nuclear club" was also criticized by the Labour Party's left-wing newspapers as playing a pose.
    The Labour Party's leadership also made some other efforts to offset some of the Conservative Party's tactical advantages.
    In this regard, Gatskell and Bevan's visit to Moscow can be mentioned. Here, the Labour Party leaders were received by Khrushchev and jointly held talks on some international issues. Bevan, who is generally expected to become Foreign Minister if the Labour Party wins this election, elaborated on his party's position on foreign policy issues at a press conference at the end of the trip.
    Bevan particularly stated that the Labour Party supports the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower and believes that such meetings can produce beneficial results. Bevan said that, of course, these meetings should not be expected to solve all international problems, but the main thing is to find some close viewpoints, which may lead to the successful resolution of certain international problems at the summit conference in the future.
    When talking about the issue of nuclear weapons, Bevan said that the Labour Party advocates that Britain unilaterally stop testing such weapons; regardless of the progress of negotiations with other countries on this issue. But the attitude of the Conservatives is different. The Macmillan government has announced that it will only agree to stop the tests after the three major powers have reached an agreement on this issue.
    Although some people in London believe that the current tactical advantage is on the side of the Conservatives, those who like to predict are not willing to rush to a conclusion. In the words of the "Economist" weekly, Londoners showed a very cautious attitude when commenting on the recent conclusion drawn from the Gallup poll that the Conservative Party had a slight advantage.
    Under the Conservative Party's rule for several years, there have been many painful scars left behind: the shameful adventure in Egypt, the costly arms race, soaring prices, unemployment, and the largest decline in production since the war.
    The only thing the Conservative Cabinet cares about is big business. In the past eight years, monopoly capital has received a large amount of tax exemptions and hundreds of thousands of subsidies. The main beneficiaries of the dozens of decrees implemented by this cabinet are bankers and industrialists. The profits of the largest industrial companies increased from 2.364 billion pounds in 1953 to 2.844 billion pounds in 1958. As for the much-publicized talk of a so-called "universal welfare state," they are still just talk so far.
    Labour Party members have used these strategic weaknesses of the Conservatives in their campaign pamphlets and leaflets. But what do they intend to offer as a substitute? At present, the Labour Party cannot put forward a program that can attract the vast majority of voters to its side. In the statement announcing its program, it has abandoned some of its previous principled demands. For example, in the campaign documents, the demand for nationalization has been replaced by the demand for some kind of "supervision" of capitalist enterprises. The propaganda of class cooperation is increasingly becoming an accepted truth.
    The Liberal Party is preparing to take advantage of the striking similarities between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party in many important policies and practical actions. This party intends to seize some votes from Labour Party members. For this purpose, it has formed alliances with the Conservatives in many constituencies. But in Britain, it is generally believed that because the Liberal Party's program and political nature are very unpredictable, they will not get much victory.
    At present, the British campaign is in full swing. The ruling class hopes that the Conservative Party can continue to govern. This party is the main spokesperson for the interests of big capitalists, financial and industrial giants in the City of London, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow.
    As for the Labour Party, its victory depends on the extent to which the workers support it.
    The British Communist Party has nominated its own candidates in seventeen constituencies to welcome this election. This party's program reflects the urgent hopes and interests of the working masses.
    The British election is not only a major event for this country. It will undoubtedly also have an impact on British foreign policy.

    英国的议会选举
    苏联　格·马里谢夫
    从传统上说，秋季在英国一向是一个政治暴风雨的季节。今年秋季的来临比通常稍微早了些。还在8月中旬英国的议员们和党的工作人员的休假心情就已受到扰乱。下院的议员已经得知，他们将不得不前往英国国会议事厅听取政府关于解散议会的决定。保守党和工党的地方组织的领导人已经接到指令，至迟必须在9月中旬前赶回他们的选区。
    最后，在9月8日，正式宣布了下院的选举日期。选举规定在10月8日举行。本届议会的职能到1960年5月就告终止。因此，选举将指定在这个日期前举行。
    尽管议会选举是在距选举日一共只有三到四个星期前才宣布，这给了执政的保守党以一定的优势，但是这个“突然因素”却被减少到最低限度。原来，竞选运动事实上早在正式宣布选举日期以前，即在1959年初，就已经开始。各个主要政党指挥部所散发的竞选宣言、小册子和纲领性的声明把整个国家都淹没了。工党人士就内政外交问题一个又一个地印发了十多种以上不同的文件：从“工党党员为您提供的未来”这类一般性宣言起直到关于保健休养的计划为止。
    保守党人士对于工党所发的每一个文件都散发了针锋相对的反宣传小册子。他们同样宣布了自己的竞选纲领。他们也印发了关于组织休养的大量宣言和颂扬保守党领袖活动的色彩夺目的小册子。
    这次，自由党也散发了大量的传单，活跃异常。
    不论工党或保守党都十分重视准备竞选的工作。例如保守党人决定重新划分迄今为止工党在那里还拥有强大实力的四十个选区范围。
    工党人士用了很大力量来消除自己组织工作的弱点。他们认为这是工党上两次选举失败的主要原因。他们已用富有鼓动经验的工作人员加强地方支部。党的执行委员会会议曾几次讨论了准备选举的进程，在一次这样的会议上还决定要在9月进行一次“全国征集党员周”。
    通过和制定的组织措施是如此之多，工党领导上已感到信心十足。
    党的总书记摩根·菲利浦斯在一次执行委员会会议上声称，“我们不会措手不及的”。比万9月7日在莫斯科记者招待会上说：“工党党员有很多获胜的机会。我们怀着对自己力量的极大信心开始竞选活动……”
    但是保守党的活动家也对自己的胜利抱有信心。英国报刊甚至认为，保守党拥有更多的运用战术手段的机会。他们首先认为英国经济情况有利于麦克米伦的党。去年的生产下降已经停止。固然，现在仍然有经济不稳定的征象，例如，8月份失业人数又有所增加。但是，失业数字却比去年、甚至比今春为低，那时英国政府曾决定推迟选举。今年年底，预料经济情况又会出现新的恶化。这迫使保守党人不得不匆忙宣布举行选举。
    此外，麦克米伦访问莫斯科并支持举行
  “最高级会议”，使他的个人威信获得了提高，这也对保守党有利。在英国舆论界，缓和国际紧张局势和停止冷战的主张目前占压倒优势。保守党人已估计到这一情绪。8月15日“每日先驱论坛报”断言，保守党人在选民面前所提出的一个主要口号将是：“为了高级会议保卫麦克米伦。”
    麦克米伦政府为了竞选，早在今年夏天就决定了若干准备在今年秋天实行的措施。这里特别指的是稍稍增加养老津贴和调整税率等。在下院讨论这些立法草案的时候，工党议员就径直称这些立法为“竞选诱饵”。
    最后，保守党还把希望寄托在工党内部的分歧上。今年夏天在工会和工党组织开始认真讨论关于核武器问题的时候，工党的执行委员会和一些大的职工会在对待这个问题的态度上就出现了严重的分歧。工党执行委员会在一个题为“裁军和核战争，应走的下一步”的冗长文件中陈述了它的观点。但是，和领导的预料相反，这个文件引起工党许多普通党员的不满。工党执行委员会在发表声明时，同样完全漠视了公众的关于使美国原子火箭基地撤离英国和禁止携带原子弹的美国轰炸机在英国领空飞行的要求。它的关于建立所谓“非核子俱乐部”的倡议，也被工党左翼报纸批评为玩弄姿态。
    工党的领导还进行了另外一些努力来抵消保守党在战术上的一些优势。
    在这方面可以提出的就是盖茨克尔和比万的访问莫斯科。在这里，工党的领袖们曾受到赫鲁晓夫的接待，并共同就一些国际问题进行了谈话。如果工党这次竞选胜利，一般预料就会出任外交大臣的比万于旅程结束时，在记者招待会上阐述了他的党在外交问题上的立场。
    比万特别表示，工党赞成赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔的会见，并认为这类会见能产生有益结果。比万说，当然，不应期望这些会见能解决各项国际问题，但是主要的是要寻找出一些接近的观点，这些观点将来在最高级会议上可能导致某些国际问题的顺利解决。
    在谈到核武器问题的时候，比万说，工党主张英国单方面停止试验这类武器；不管在这个问题上同其他国家的谈判进程如何。但保守党人的态度则是另外一种。麦克米伦政府曾宣布，只有在三大国就这个问题达成协议之后，它才赞成停止试验。
    尽管在伦敦有人认为目前战术优势是在保守党人方面，但是喜欢预测的人还不愿忙于作出结论。用“经济学人”周刊的话来说就是，伦敦人士在评述最近由盖洛普民意测验所得出的保守党略占优势的结论时，表现了非常慎重的态度。
    几年来，在保守党当政下，曾留下不少苦痛的疮疤：对埃及的可耻的冒险，耗费巨大的军备竞赛，物价的飞涨，失业，战后最大的一次生产下降。
    保守党内阁唯一关心的是大企业。在最近八年中，垄断资本得到了大量的免税和成千上万的津贴。从这个内阁所施行的几十条法令中得益的主要是银行家和实业家。最大的工业公司的利润从1953年的二十三亿六千四百万镑增加到1958年的二十八亿四千四百万镑。至于说到那个被大事宣扬的所谓“普遍福利国家”的谈论，那么它们至今仍然不过是谈论而已。
    工党党员们在他们的竞选小册子和传单中利用了保守党人的这些战略弱点。但是他们又打算提出什么代替品呢？目前，工党还提不出能把绝大多数选民吸引到自己方面来的纲领。它在宣布自己的纲领的声明中，已放弃了它以前的一些原则性要求。例如，在竞选文件中，国有化要求已为对资本主义企业进行某种“监督”的要求所代替。阶级合作的宣传愈益成为公认的真理。
    自由党正在准备利用保守党和工党在许多重要的政策和实际行动上的惊人类似。这个党打算从工党党员处夺取一些选票。为了这个目的，它在许多选区中同保守党人结成联盟。但是在英国，一般都认为，由于自由党人的纲领和政治性非常令人捉摸不定，所以他们不会得到多大胜利。
    目前，英国竞选运动正在高潮中。统治阶级希望仍能由保守党继续执政。这个党是伦敦城、曼彻斯特、伯明翰和格拉斯哥的大资本家、财政实业巨头利益的主要代言人。
    至于工党，它的胜利要看工人对它支持的程度如何。
    英国共产党在迎接这次选举中已在十七个选区提出自己的候选人。这个党的纲领反映了劳动群众迫切的希望和利益。
    英国的选举不仅就这个国家说是一个重大事件。它对英国的外交政策无疑也将发生影响。
