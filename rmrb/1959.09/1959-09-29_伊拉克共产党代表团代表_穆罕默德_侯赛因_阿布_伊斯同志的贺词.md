Dear Comrades,

    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, our delegation, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party and all its members, and on behalf of the Iraqi working class and working masses, extends our warmest congratulations to the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee, to Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the great Chinese people.

    The Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and reactionaries, and their struggle for national independence, peace, democracy, and socialism, serve as the best inspiration for the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries (including our Iraqi people and the people of other Arab countries).

    The Chinese revolution has been and will continue to be an experienced and vibrant school for the people of all countries. Great China has taught the people of all countries how to resolutely and successfully oppose world imperialism and destroy the rule of imperialist monopoly capital and its running dogs. The unity of all anti-imperialist forces to form a national united front is the best experience and the most creative application of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party provides this experience to the people of all countries who are engaged in the anti-imperialist struggle, and it is the only correct path to win liberation and defend the fruits of the revolution. The construction and development of China's national economy are based on industrialization, land reform, and the establishment of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations with various countries. In this regard, China provides a living example worthy of learning for newly independent countries with backward economies. The People's Republic of China has adopted an unwavering stance against the aggressive, divisive, and provocative policies that the United States still pursues. This is the best example for every country struggling to protect its national independence and the fruits of its liberation. All this has been achieved thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, who creatively applied Marxism-Leninism based on the conditions of the Chinese revolution and brought into full play the infinite power of the broad masses of the people in the cause of revolution, economic construction, and advancing along the socialist road.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have had a significant impact on the people's camp overwhelming the imperialist and reactionary camp, and on strengthening the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and for peace and national independence. The People's Republic of China stands firmly with the people of these countries. When the people of these countries were in the darkest of circumstances, the People's Republic of China supported them and helped them get rid of imperialist rule. The People's Republic of China has made outstanding contributions in strengthening the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples, in opposing imperialism, and in formulating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence established at the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, which have been recognized worldwide. The People's Republic of China has also played a significant role in eliminating the imperialist system and maintaining peace.

    We, the Iraqi people—Arabs, Kurds, and all ethnic groups and strata of Iraq—will never forget the attitude expressed by the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people in supporting the victorious July 14 Revolution and preventing British and American intervention in Iraq.

    Similarly, our people and the people of other Arab countries will never forget the support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Arab people, will never forget the assistance received by the fraternal Egyptian people from China during the tripartite colonial aggression against Egypt, will never forget China's glorious stance when the United States and Britain landed in Lebanon and Jordan, and will never forget China's firm and continuous support for the Algerian revolution and the Algerian Provisional Government, as well as for Oman, Aden, and other Arab countries.

    In our Iraqi people's long struggle, until we achieved the victory of the July 14 democratic national revolution through the unity of the military and the people, the Chinese people's struggle has always strengthened our confidence and given us great inspiration. The July 14 Revolution, under the leadership of leader Abdul Karim Kassem, overthrew the regime of imperialism and its running dogs, destroyed the Baghdad Pact, and established an independent Republic of Iraq. From its very inception, our republic has received the firm support of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and of all freedom-loving peoples of all countries. Our republic has participated in the movement to strengthen world peace and support the liberation of the fraternal Arab peoples, and in all other anti-imperialist movements of countries that are struggling. Our republic continues to wage the struggle to crush the colonialist conspiracies plotted by the colonialists and their reactionary agents in the Republic of Iraq, other Arab countries, and the Middle East. Our national government is supported by all anti-imperialist classes, all ethnic groups, and all patriotic forces with different political inclinations in the Iraqi people, led by our Communist Party. Our Communist Party, with "Defend the Republic of Iraq" as its primary slogan and central task, is striving to unite all patriotic forces under this slogan to support the government of leader Abdul Karim Kassem against imperialism and reactionaries, and to achieve our revolutionary goals in democracy, land reform, and building a prosperous national economy.

    Our people are close friends of the Chinese people, and they cherish the support they have received in the struggle to defend the republic and the fruits of their national democratic revolution. Our people's friendship with the Chinese people is profound, and this friendship is not limited to communists but includes all patriotic people of different ethnic groups and strata. The fact that our republic's government and people celebrate the Chinese people's National Day together is a manifestation of this friendship. Our people are watching the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all fields. We wholeheartedly congratulate China on its increasing prosperity and development, warmly support the People's Republic of China in obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and warmly support the People's Republic of China in recovering Taiwan, which has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times. The Iraqi people strongly condemn the position of US imperialism in this regard.

    We, the Iraqi Communist Party, extend our fraternal and warm greetings to the glorious Chinese Communist Party and congratulate the Chinese people on achieving even greater successes in the Great Leap Forward in developing the national economy and building socialism.

    Long live the great Chinese people! Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the heroic Chinese Communist Party and the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live the great socialist camp! Long live guiding Marxism-Leninism!

    May the friendship between Iraq and China be eternally strengthened and consolidated!

    伊拉克共产党代表团代表
    穆罕默德·侯赛因·阿布·伊斯同志的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    值此中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立十周年之际，我们代表团谨代表伊拉克共产党中央委员会和全体党员，并代表伊拉克工人阶级和劳动大众，向光荣的中国共产党及其中央委员会，向毛泽东同志和伟大的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民反对帝国主义和反动派的斗争，争取民族独立、和平、民主和社会主义的斗争，是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民（包括我们伊拉克人民和其他阿拉伯国家人民）的反帝斗争的最好的鼓舞力量。
    中国革命过去和将来都是各国人民的一所富有经验和生气勃勃的学校。伟大的中国教给了各国人民怎样坚定地和成功地反对世界帝国主义，摧毁帝国主义垄断资本及其走狗的统治。一切反帝力量联合起来组成民族统一战线是一条最好的经验，是马克思列宁主义的最富有创造性的运用。中国共产党领导进行的中国革命为正在进行反帝斗争的各国人民提供了这条经验，它是争取解放和保卫革命果实的唯一正确的道路。中国国民经济的建设和发展是在工业化、土地改革以及和各国建立平等互利的贸易关系的基础上进行的。在这方面，中国给了经济落后的新近才获得独立的各国人民以活生生的值得学习的范例。美帝国主义至今仍然奉行着侵略、离间和挑衅的政策，中华人民共和国采取了坚定不移的立场，来反对这种政策。这对于为保护自己的民族独立、保护自己的解放果实而进行斗争的每个国家来说，是一个最好的典范。这一切之所以能够实现，是由于有了中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导，他们根据中国革命的条件并在革命、经济建设和沿着社会主义道路迈进的事业中发挥了广大人民群众的无限力量，从而创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义。
    中国革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，对人民阵营压倒帝国主义和反动派阵营，对加强各国人民反对帝国主义，争取和平和民族独立的斗争有着重大的影响。中华人民共和国坚定不移地和这些国家的人民站在一起。当这些国家的人民处在最黑暗的环境里的时候，中华人民共和国支持他们，帮助他们摆脱帝国主义的统治。在增强亚非人民的团结方面，在反对帝国主义方面，在制定万隆会议和开罗会议所确定的并在世界范围内得到承认的和平共处五项原则方面，中华人民共和国都作出了卓越的贡献。在消灭帝国主义制度和维护和平方面，中华人民共和国也起了重大的作用。
    我们伊拉克人民——阿拉伯人、库尔德人以及伊拉克的各民族和各阶层，绝不会忘掉中华人民共和国和伟大的中国人民为了支援胜利的七月十四革命和制止英、美对伊拉克的干涉所表示的态度。
    同样，我国人民和其他阿拉伯各国人民绝不会忘掉中国人民对阿拉伯各国人民的斗争的支持，绝不会忘掉兄弟的埃及人民在殖民主义三国侵略埃及期间从中国方面得到的支援，绝不会忘记中国在美、英两国登陆黎巴嫩和约旦时的光荣立场，也绝不会忘记中国对阿尔及利亚的革命和阿尔及利亚临时政府以及对阿曼、亚丁和其他阿拉伯国家的坚定的不断的支持。
    在我们伊拉克人民漫长的斗争中，直到我们由于军民力量的团结取得了7月14日的民主民族革命的胜利，中国人民的斗争一直使我们增强信心，使我们得到莫大的鼓舞。7月14日革命在领袖阿布杜勒·凯里姆·卡塞姆的领导下推翻了帝国主义的及其走狗的政权，摧毁了巴格达侵略联盟，建立了独立的伊拉克共和国。我们的共和国一诞生就得到了以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的各社会主义国家和一切爱好自由的各国人民的坚决的支持。我们的共和国已经参加了加强世界和平和支持兄弟的阿拉伯各国人民的解放的运动，参加了其他一切正在斗争中的各国人民的反帝运动。我们的共和国继续进行粉碎殖民主义者及其在伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家以及中东地区的反动代理人所策划的殖民主义阴谋的斗争，我们的民族政府得到了伊拉克人民各反帝阶级、各个民族和所有的具有不同的政治倾向的以我们共产党为首的爱国力量的支持。我们共产党把“保卫伊拉克共和国”做为自己的首要口号和中心任务，正努力在这个口号下团结一切爱国力量，来支持领袖阿布杜勒·凯里姆·卡塞姆反对帝国主义和反动派的政府，争取实现我们在民主、土改和建设繁荣的国民经济等方面的革命目标。
    我国人民是中国人民的亲密的朋友，我国人民珍视他们在保卫共和国和他们的民族民主革命的果实的斗争中所得到的支持。我国人民对中国人民的友谊是深厚的，这种友谊不只是局限于共产党人，而是包括了一切不同民族和不同阶层的爱国人民。我们共和国的政府和人民同中国人民在一起欢庆中国人民的国庆节，就是这种友谊的表现。我国人民注视中国人民在各方面所取得的伟大成就。衷心地祝贺中国日益繁荣和发展，热烈地支持中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法地位，热烈地支持中华人民共和国收回台湾，台湾自古以来就是中国不可分割的一部分。伊拉克人民强烈地谴责美帝国主义在这方面的立场。
    我们伊拉克共产党向光荣的中国共产党致以兄弟般的热烈的敬意，同时祝贺中国人民在发展国民经济和建设社会主义的大跃进中获得更大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！
    英勇的中国共产党和中国共产党的英明领导万岁！
    伟大的社会主义阵营万岁！具有指导意义的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    愿伊中友谊永恒地加强和巩固！（附图片）
