Xinhua News Agency, 10th — After ten years of construction, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the backward consumer city of Beijing has laid a preliminary foundation for industrialization. Now, Beijing has a certain scale in steel smelting industry, electromechanical manufacturing industry, electronic radio industry, cotton and wool textile industry, chemical industry, building materials industry, etc. This was stated by Wan Li, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, in his work report on behalf of the Municipal People's Committee at the Second Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress. (The full text of the report is on pages six and seven)

Wan Li described the magnificent picture of the Great Leap Forward in the capital with countless inspiring concrete facts, powerfully shattering the shameless slanders and calumnies of all hostile elements at home and abroad against the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes.

The Second Session of the Third Beijing Municipal People's Congress was held today in the auditorium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The meeting will review and discuss the work report of the Municipal People's Committee and the report on the final accounts of financial revenue and expenditure. The first session of the Second Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC also opened today, and CPPCC members attended today's session of the People's Congress as non-voting delegates.

Wan Li pointed out in his report: When Beijing was just liberated, it had almost no modern industry. In 1949, the total output value of industry and handicrafts in the city was only 170 million yuan. In 1958, the output value soared from 2.1 billion yuan in 1957 to 4.6 billion yuan, an increase of 26 times compared with 1949. The increase in output value this year exceeded the sum of the increase in output value in the previous nine years. This shows that in the ten years since liberation, under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the strong support of the people of the whole country, and with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, Beijing has been advancing by leaps and bounds, and 1958 was a year of unprecedented Great Leap Forward.

Wan Li then recounted the high-speed leap forward of several major industrial products such as steel, steel products, pig iron, raw coal, electricity, metal cutting machine tools, power machinery, electronics, and radio industries. For example, in steel, Beijing had no steel-making enterprises at all in 1949. The annual output of steel was only 28,000 tons the year before last. In the Great Leap Forward last year, the output of steel soared to 160,000 tons (including more than 120,000 tons of "native steel"). In the first eight months of this year, 200,600 tons of "native steel" have been produced. For pig iron, the annual output in 1949 was 26,000 tons, which increased to 430,000 tons the year before last, and leaped to 520,000 tons last year, an increase of nearly 19 times compared with 1949. From January to August this year, 454,400 tons have been produced. For raw coal, the annual output in 1949 was 1.11 million tons, which increased to 2.57 million tons the year before last, and soared to 4.6 million tons last year. The output in the first eight months of this year has reached 4.09 million tons, an increase of 68.5% over the same period last year. After listing various facts, Wan Li said that the hostile elements at home and abroad are now scolding our Great Leap Forward as a "Great Leap Backward," which can only be blamed on their short-sightedness and malicious intentions. Hostile elements at home and abroad slander that the mass steelmaking effort "failed," and right-leaning opportunists also nonsense that large-scale steel production "outweighed the gains." In the face of ironclad facts, these arguments have been refuted.

Wan Li then reported on the Great Leap Forward in rural areas. After explaining the tremendous achievements in suburban agricultural production and agricultural construction over the past ten years, he focused on describing the prosperous scene of the suburban rural areas after the realization of people's communes. Last year, the per-mu yield of grain, according to verified figures, increased by more than double compared with 1949 and by 47% compared with the year before last. The original seven near-suburban districts produced nearly 1.6 billion jin of vegetables last year, an increase of nearly 400 million jin compared with the year before last, equivalent to more than 13 times the annual output in 1949. This year, all kinds of production continue to leap forward in an all-round way, and the total output of wheat has increased by 35% compared with last year. The accumulation of agriculture and the basic construction of agriculture have also expanded rapidly. In the past year, in addition to the continuous construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the Huairou Reservoir and many small reservoirs, the larger Miyun Reservoir jointly built with Hebei Province has also been successfully dammed. These water conservancy projects have increased the actual benefited irrigation area in the entire suburbs from 580,000 mu the year before last to 2.37 million mu last year. Wan Li said, now hostile elements at home and abroad are saying that "the people's communes have messed up," and "the peasants in the communes have begun to lose interest in increasing production." Isn't this shameless rumor-mongering?

People's representatives and CPPCC members were very excited to continue listening to Wan Li's report on urban construction. Wan Li said that in the ten years since liberation, Beijing has built 27.24 million square meters of new houses, which is equivalent to 1.3 times the original building area of Beijing. The construction area completed in 1958 increased from an average of 3 million square meters per year during the first five-year plan to 4.57 million square meters. In the first eight months of this year, buildings with an area of 3.37 million square meters have been successively started. New-style factories such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the Beijing Steel Plant, the Special Steel Plant, the Coking Chemical Plant, the First Machine Tool Plant, the Turbine Plant, and the Agricultural Machinery Plant were all newly built and expanded during this period. Large-scale public buildings such as the National People's Congress, the Chinese Revolution Museum, the Chinese History Museum, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, the National Culture Palace, the Beijing Railway Station, and the Workers' Stadium have also been completed and will soon be completed in the past year.

Wan Li then explained the issue of commodity supply in the market. He listed the following figures to illustrate the unprecedented expansion of the commodity market. In the first half of this year, the total value of commodity purchases reached 1.68 billion yuan, an increase of 1.2 times over the same period last year, and the total retail sales of social commodities reached 1.09 billion yuan, an increase of 43% over the same period last year. Both the absolute amount of the increase and the speed of the increase exceeded those of previous years. Compared with the same period last year, the supply of major commodities in the first half of this year increased by 27% for grain, 54% for edible oil, 22% for vegetables, 61% for aquatic products, 16% for sugar, 2.5 times for pastries, doubled for wine, 82% for cotton cloth, 2.3 times for woolen fabrics, 1.4 times for cotton sweaters and trousers, doubled for vests, 48% for towels, 1.9 times for rubber shoes, 40% for cloth shoes, 88% for soap, 1.8 times for radios, 2.5 times for fountain pens, and 1.8 times for washbasins. The supply of only pork, eggs, and a very small number of daily-use industrial products decreased. After vigorously arranging production and organizing sources of goods, and with the support of various parts of the country, the supply situation of this very small number of commodities has improved since June.

Wan Li pointed out that the temporary shortage of supply of certain commodities is mainly due to the increased purchasing power resulting from population growth and the increase in the employed population. In the past, a small number of people had very high purchasing power, while the purchasing power of most people was very low and the consumption was very small. Now this situation has undergone fundamental changes, and the purchasing power of urban and rural people has generally increased. This is a very good thing. According to comparable figures, the total retail sales of social commodities increased from 220 million yuan in 1949 to 1.64 billion yuan in 1958, an increase of 6.4 times. However, in the same period, calculated according to the original district division, the city's population only increased by 88%. Wan Li said, a small number of bourgeois elements and other exploiting class elements whose thinking has not yet been transformed say that nothing can be bought in Beijing. What is the actual situation? The Beijing Department Store alone regularly sells more than 32,000 kinds of commodities. May I ask these gentlemen, when has Beijing ever had so many commodities in the past?

Wan Li then reported on cultural education and health work. He said that before liberation, about half of the school-age children in Beijing could not go to primary school, and even fewer studied in middle schools and universities. Now the city has 1.35 million students in universities, middle schools, primary schools, and secondary vocational schools, accounting for one-fifth of the city's total population. Compared with the early days of liberation, the number of university students has increased by nearly seven times, the number of middle school students has increased by five times, and primary school education has been universalized. More importantly, under the guidance of the Party's education policy, the education cause has undergone a fundamental change in nature, and the state of separation between theory and practice has been greatly changed. At the time of liberation, there were very few large hospitals in Beijing, and there were only more than 4,000 doctors and other medical personnel in the city, with only 3,000 beds. In 1958, the number of doctors and other medical personnel increased to nearly 30,000, and the number of beds increased to more than 21,000. There have also been great leaps forward in cultural arts, mass health, and scientific research.

Wan Li said that the continuous leap forward in all aspects of our socialist construction fully proves the correctness of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Finally, Wan Li put forward the current fighting tasks of the city in his report. He said that the most important thing at present is to unswervingly continue to implement the Party's general line, oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with the achievements of a new Great Leap Forward in the in-depth development of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy. He also put forward specific goals and main measures for the work of industry, agriculture, basic construction, commerce, and other aspects. He called on the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and other patriotic people of the capital to unite more closely, and under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, hold high the glorious banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and bravely advance.

At today's meeting, Deputy Mayor Cheng Hongyi made a report on the final accounts of Beijing's financial revenue and expenditure in 1958 and the budget of financial revenue and expenditure in 1959, and submitted it to the congress for review. The meeting will continue.

    无数振奋人心的事实粉碎了国内外敌对分子的诽谤和诬蔑
    人民首都十年巨变日进千里
    万里副市长在北京市第三届人代会第二次会议上作工作报告
    跃进十年（1949——1958年）的宏伟图景
    工业、手工业的总产值增长了二十六倍
    粮食亩产增长一倍多，蔬菜产量增长十二倍
    新建房屋等于北京城原建筑面积的一点三倍
    商品零售额增长六点四倍，而人口只增长88％
    大学生增加近七倍，中学生增加五倍，小学教育已普及
    据新华社10日讯　经过十年的建设，特别是1958年的大跃进，落后的消费城市北京已经奠定了工业化的初步基础。现在，北京市的钢铁冶炼工业、机电制造工业、电子无线电工业、棉毛纺织工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业等方面，都具有一定的规模。这是北京市副市长万里在市第三届人民代表大会第二次会议上，代表市人民委员会所作的工作报告中说的。（报告全文见第六、七版）
    万里用无数振奋人心的具体事实，描述了首都大跃进的宏伟图景，有力地粉碎了国内外一切敌对分子对社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的无耻诽谤和诬蔑。
    北京市第三届人民代表大会第二次会议今天在全国政协礼堂举行。会议将审查、讨论市人民委员会工作报告和财政收支预决算的报告。市政协二届一次会议也在今天开幕，政协委员们列席了今天的人代会会议。
    万里在报告中指出：北京在刚解放的时候，几乎没有现代化的工业。1949年全市工业、手工业的总产值只有一亿七千万元，1958年产值由1957年的二十一亿元猛增至四十六亿元，比1949年增长了二十六倍，这一年产值的增长数，超过了以前九年产值增长数的总和。今年前八个月，工业和手工业的产值又比去年同期增长了一倍多。这说明解放十年来的北京，在党中央的直接领导和全国人民的大力支援下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助下，是在不断飞跃前进的过程中，而1958年更是空前大跃进的一年。
    万里接着历述了钢，钢材，生铁，原煤，电力，金属切削机床，动力机械，电子、无线电工业等几种主要工业产品高速度跃进的情况，例如钢，北京1949年根本没有炼钢企业，前年钢的年产量也只有二万八千吨，去年大跃进中，钢产量猛升到十六万吨（其中“洋钢”十二万多吨）。今年前八个月已生产了二十万零六千吨“洋钢”。生铁，1949年年产量二万六千吨，前年增长到四十三万吨，去年跃进到五十二万吨，比1949年增长了将近十九倍。今年1至8月已经生产了四十五万四千吨。原煤，1949年年产量一百一十一万吨，前年增长到二百五十七万吨，去年飞升到四百六十万吨，今年前八个月的产量已达到四百零九万吨，比去年同期增长了68.5％。万里在列举了各种事实以后说，现在国内外的敌对分子谩骂我们的大跃进是“大跃退”，这只能怪他们眼光短浅，居心不良。国内外敌对分子诬蔑大炼钢铁“失败了”，右倾机会主义分子也胡说大办钢铁“得不偿失”，在铁的事实面前，这些论调已不攻自破。
    万里接着报告了农村大跃进的情况。他在说明十年来郊区农业生产和农业建设方面的巨大成就以后，着重描述了郊区农村在实现人民公社化以后的一派兴旺景象。去年粮食的亩产量，根据核实的数字，比1949年增长了一倍多，比前年增长了47％。原来七个近郊区去年生产的蔬菜近十六亿斤，比前年增产近四亿斤，等于1949年年产量的十三倍以上。今年各项生产继续全面跃进，小麦的总产量比去年增长了35％。农业的积累和农业的基本建设也迅速扩大了，在去年一年内，除连续建成了十三陵水库、怀柔水库和很多小型水库外，和河北省共同建设的规模更大的密云水库也已胜利拦洪。这些水利事业使全郊区实际受益的灌溉面积，从前年的五十八万亩增长到去年的二百三十七万亩。万里说，现在国内外敌对分子，说什么“人民公社搞糟了”，“公社内的农民开始失去增加生产的兴趣”，这不是无耻造谣是什么呢？
    人民代表和政协委员们十分兴奋地继续听取了万里关于城市建设情况的报告。万里说，解放十年来北京新建了二千七百二十四万平方米面积的房屋，等于北京城原有建筑面积的一点三倍。1958年竣工的建筑面积，由第一个五年计划期间平均每年三百万平方米增长到四百五十七万平方米。今年前八个月已经有面积达三百三十七万平方米的建筑相继开工。石景山钢铁公司、北京钢厂、特殊钢厂、炼焦化学厂、第一机床厂汽轮机厂、农业机械厂等新式工厂，都是在这期间新建和扩建的。全国人民代表大会、中国革命博物馆、中国历史博物馆、中国人民革命军事博物馆、民族文化宫、北京车站、工人体育场等大型公共建筑，也在最近一年时间内陆续建成和即将建成。
    万里接着就市场的商品供应问题作了说明。他列举以下数字，来说明商品市场空前扩大的情形。今年上半年，商品购进总值达十六亿八千万元，比去年同期增长一点二倍，社会商品零售总额达到十亿零九千万元，比去年同期增长43％。增长的绝对数和增长的速度都超过了往年。今年上半年主要商品的供应量和去年同期比，粮食增长27％，食油增长54％，蔬菜增长22％，水产增长61％，食糖增长16％，糕点增长二点五倍，酒增长一倍，棉布增长82％，呢绒增长二点三倍，棉毛衫裤增长一点四倍，汗衫背心增长二倍，毛巾增长48％，胶鞋增长一点九倍，布鞋增长40％，肥皂增长88％，收音机增长一点八倍，金笔增长二点五倍，面盆增长一点八倍。供应量减少的只有猪肉、蛋品和极少数日用工业品。这极少一部分商品，经过大力安排生产，组织货源，同时在全国各地的支援下，6月以后供应情况已经有了好转。
    万里指出，某些商品供应一时出现紧张现象，主要是由于人口增长和就业人口增加而使购买力提高的结果。过去是一部分人有很高的购买力，而多数人的购买力很低、消费量很少，现在这种情况已发生了根本变化，城乡人民的购买力普遍提高了。这是一件极大的好事。按照可比的数字计算，社会商品零售额从1949年的二亿二千万元增长到1958年的十六亿四千万元，即增长了六点四倍。但在同一时期内，按原来的区划范围计算，全市人口只增长了88％。万里说，有少数思想尚未改造好的资产阶级分子和其他剥削阶级分子，说在北京什么也买不到，实际情况怎样呢？仅百货大楼经常出售的就有三万二千多种商品。请问这些先生们，北京过去什么时候有过这样多的商品吗？
    万里接着报告了文化教育和卫生工作的情况。他说，解放前北京大约有一半的学龄儿童不能上小学，在中学和大学读书的更少，现在全市大、中、小学和中等专业学校学生已达到一百三十五万人，占全市总人口的五分之一。和解放初期比，大学生增长了近七倍，中学生增长了五倍，小学教育已经普及。更重要的是在党的教育方针的指导下，教育事业已经发生了根本性质的变化，在很大程度上改变了理论与实际脱离的状态。解放时北京较大的医院很少，全市的医生和其他医务人员只有四千多人，病床只有三千张，1958年医生和其他医务人员增加到近三万人，病床增长到二万一千多张。在文化艺术、群众卫生、科学研究等方面，也都有了巨大的跃进。
    万里说，我们在社会主义建设的各个方面不断跃进的事实，充分证明了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的正确。
    万里最后在报告中提出了全市当前的战斗任务。他说，当前最主要的是要毫不动摇地继续贯彻执行党的总路线，反右倾，鼓干劲，在深入开展增产节约的群众运动中，用新的大跃进的成就，来响应中共八届八中全会的号召。他并且对工业、农业、基本建设、商业以及其他各个方面的工作，提出了具体的奋斗目标和主要措施。他号召首都的工人、农民、革命知识分子和其他爱国的人民，要更加紧密地团结起来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉旗帜奋勇前进。
    在今天的会议上，副市长程宏毅做了关于北京市1958年财政收支决算和1959年财政收支预算的报告，提请大会审查。会议将继续举行。
