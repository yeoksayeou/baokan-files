Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 29th: Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of Czechoslovakia, said that no capitalist country, even during its fastest-growing peak period, could compare with the high speed created by the People's Democratic Czechoslovakia in economic construction.

　　In his report at the rally commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising on the 29th, he reviewed the great achievements made by Czechoslovakia in economic construction, especially in industrial production, since its liberation. He pointed out that compared with the pre-war period, Czechoslovakia's machinery industry in 1958 increased by 430%, steel production increased from 2.3 million tons to 5.5 million tons, power generation increased from 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 19.6 billion kilowatt-hours, hard coal production increased from 16.7 million tons to 27.2 million tons, and brown coal increased from 17.4 million tons to 54.3 million tons. He emphasized that, from all basic industrial sectors, Czechoslovakia will be at the forefront of the world in terms of per capita output in 1965.

　　He emphasized that the victory of socialism in the countryside is one of the greatest victories achieved in the past period. He pointed out that agricultural output per hundred hectares of arable land in 1958 increased by 20.2% compared with 1949.

　　In his report, Novotný also mentioned that the task of Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) is to further develop the productive forces of an advanced socialist society, so that it can move towards communism in the latter five years of the 1960s.

　　Novotný said that the current international situation is very favorable, so the Czechoslovak people can advance by leaps and bounds in socialist construction. No force in the world can make the Czechoslovak people deviate from the path they have embarked on since liberation.

　　In his report, Novotný praised the great achievements made by the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp in peaceful diplomacy in recent years. He pointed out that the upcoming mutual visits between Khrushchev and Eisenhower mark the melting of the ice of the Cold War.

    诺沃提尼在纪念斯洛伐克民族起义大会上说
    捷克斯洛伐克经济高速发展
    任何资本主义国家望尘莫及
    据新华社布拉格29日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记、捷克斯洛伐克总统诺沃提尼说，没有任何一个资本主义国家，甚至在它发展最快的高潮时期，能够同人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克在经济建设中所创造的高速度相比。
    他在29日纪念斯洛伐克民族起义十五周年大会上所作的报告中回顾了捷克斯洛伐克解放以来在经济建设，特别是在工业生产方面所取得的伟大成就。他指出，同战前相比，1958年捷克斯洛伐克的机械工业增加了430％，钢产量从二百三十万吨增加到五百五十万吨，发电量从四十一亿度增加到一百九十六亿度，硬煤产量从一千六百七十万吨增加到二千七百二十万吨，褐煤从一千七百四十万吨增加到五千四百三十万吨。他强调说，从所有的基本工业部门来看，捷克斯洛伐克1965年将在每人平均产量方面居于世界前列。
    他强调说，社会主义在乡村的胜利，是在过去这段时期中所取得的最伟大的胜利之一。他指出，1958年每一百公顷耕地的农业产量比1949年增加了20.2％。
    诺沃提尼在报告中还谈到，捷克斯洛伐克第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）的任务是进一步发展一个发达的社会主义社会的生产力，以便在二十世纪六十年代的后五年就能够向共产主义前进。
    诺沃提尼说，当前国际局势非常有利，因而捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设中能够大踏步地前进。世界上没有任何一种力量能够使捷克斯洛伐克人民离开他们在解放以后所踏上的道路。
    诺沃提尼在报告中赞扬了苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国的和平外交政策在近年来所取得的巨大成就。他指出，赫鲁晓夫和艾森豪威尔即将举行的相互访问标志着冷战的冰块正在融化。
