    Fierce Xiangqi Preliminary Round
    Zhang Xiongfei, Director of the Chess Competition Committee
    The preliminary stage of the Chinese Xiangqi (chess) competition for the First National Games concluded late on the night of the 19th after six full days of intense battles. A total of twenty-six athletes from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government participated in the preliminary stage. Many provinces and regions, in order to select this one representative, went through layers of selection and fought at each level. It was truly selecting the best of the best, and only then was this representative chosen to come to Beijing for the competition. This has played a great role in promoting the more extensive and in-depth development of our country's inherent Xiangqi movement. Compared with the previous three National Xiangqi Championships, where players were selected locally only from a few large and medium-sized cities, this time the mass base is much deeper. Therefore, among these twenty-six players, ten newcomers participated in a national competition for the first time, accounting for 40% of the total. After six days of competition, one of these ten newcomers obtained the right to participate in the finals, and two others obtained third place in their groups. This fully illustrates that due to the extensive development of mass sports in our country, new forces in Chinese Xiangqi are also constantly growing.
    During the group preliminaries, many players played many good games, and they were not constrained by the old ways. There were quite a few bold and insightful creations, so they played fiercely and the competition was extremely intense.
    In the first group of the preliminary round, from the first day, there was a scene of shocking waves and thrilling moments. Later, everyone competed and fought for each other, each with their own strengths. It was not until the final round on the 19th, near the end of the game, that it was finally decided who obtained the right to participate in the finals. On the first day, Wu Yanfu, the representative of Gansu Province, who had been a mill apprentice since the age of fourteen, only started learning chess in his twenties, and after thirty years of research, participated in a national competition for the first time, defeated Hou Yushan, a veteran of the chess world from Beijing; on the second day, he drew with Li Yiting, the previous national champion, playing as black; on the 18th, after more than eight hours of hard struggle, he defeated Wang Jiayuan from Hebei, who had hopes of advancing, and obtained the right to participate in the finals. There were several great players in the second group, and their moves were very superb. He Shunan from Shanghai drew in the first three rounds, and only the continuous victories in the last three rounds gave him the right to advance. Another qualifier, Ma Kuan from Ningxia, was only confirmed after the final game on the night of the 19th. In the third group, Liu Yici from Zhejiang, one of the seeds, lost to Wang Jialiang from Heilongjiang in the third round. In the fourth round, against Liu Jianqing, he could have drawn but tried to "fight to the death," and as a result, he lost again. The right to participate in the finals was then obtained by Wang Jialiang and Liu Jianqing. In the fourth group, Yang Guanlin from Guangdong and Meng Liguo from Liaoning also qualified, not by chance, but because Yang defeated Wang Yuping from Shaanxi and Meng drew with Deng Peng from Yunnan in the last round.
    Wu Yanfu from Gansu "came out of nowhere" and was not shaken by Hou Yushan's reputation. He calmly attacked and finally defeated a strong enemy. This spirit is gratifying.
    In the game between Wang Jialiang and Liu Yici, Liu first used his familiar "Immortal Guides the Way" opening. In the fourth move, when Liu supplemented with the central cannon, Wang's response was not the usual horse advancing to the seventh rank, but the advisor advancing to the fifth rank, boldly sacrificing the central pawn. This move was unusual, and Liu Yici had to recalculate his plan, which made Liu Yici rack his brains. For example, when Meng Liguo played black against Yang Guanlin's central cannon and river-patrolling cannon, his response was also a departure from convention: instead of exchanging the third rank pawn or returning with a river-patrolling cannon, he flew the right advisor and opened the horizontal chariot. Although the final evaluation of this response still needs careful examination before it can be made, the spirit of daring to think and try is commendable.
    Finally, what is particularly worth mentioning is that the athletes can generally correctly understand the meaning of the competition, not focusing on pursuing personal rankings, but "doing their best" to play the best chess. For example, Ma Jinkui, the veteran from Henan, not only fought repeatedly despite repeated defeats, but also became stronger as he fought. Liu Yici, jokingly called the "three-dynasty veteran" (having won excellent rankings in 1956, 57, and 58), showed no signs of discouragement after losing the right to advance, and still exerted "all his abilities" in the final round to defeat Tang Jiapeng from Guangxi. The same is true for Li Dingyi from Hunan, Wang Qingjie from Shanxi, and other comrades. Such excellent sports moral character is the fruitful result of the continuous care and education of the Party and the leaders of various delegations.
    From the afternoon of the 20th, the eight qualified athletes have begun round-robin matches, and there will surely be more and more exciting games to come.

### 激烈的象棋预赛

    激烈的象棋预赛
    棋类竞赛委员会主任　张雄飞
    第一届全国运动会中国象棋的预赛阶段，经过六整天的鏖战，在19日深夜结束。参加预赛阶段比赛的共有二十六名运动员，他们来自各个省、自治区和直辖市。不少省、区为了选拔这一名代表，经过层层挑选，逐级搏战，真是良中选良，好中挑好，才拔出这一名上京比赛的代表。这对各地更加广泛深入地开展我国固有的象棋运动起了很大的作用。这与过去三届全国象棋锦标赛的选手仅由几个大中城市就地选拔相较，这一次的群众基础是深厚得多了。因此，在这二十六名选手中，出现了第一次参加全国性比赛的新人十名，占总数的40％。这十位新人经过六天的比赛，有一个取得了决赛权，还有两个得到小组第三名，这充分说明了由于我国群众性体育运动的广泛开展，中国象棋方面的新生力量也在不断生长。
    在分组预赛期间，很多选手下出了很多好棋，他们并不拘泥于老的一套，颇有不少大胆精辟的创造，因此走来虎虎可畏，竞争激烈非常。
    在预赛的第一组里，从头一天起便展现出惊涛骇浪、扣人心弦的情景，以后你争我夺，各有千秋，一直到19日末一轮快要完场的时刻，才最后决定出谁取得了决赛权。第一天，甘肃省代表、从十四岁起便充当磨坊徒工、二十多岁方才学棋，经过三十年来的钻研而第一次参加全国竞赛的武延福，一举击败了棋坛老将北京侯玉山；第二天又以后手战和了上届全国冠军李义庭；18日，经过八个多小时的苦斗，又把有晋级希望的河北王家元击败，获得了决赛权。第二组有几员大将，着法都很高超，上海何顺安前三轮都和，只是后三轮的连续胜利才得到了晋级权。另一晋级者宁夏马宽，是直到19日晚最后一局揭晓，方才肯定下来。第三组中，种子之一浙江刘忆慈，由于第三轮负于黑龙江王嘉良，第四轮对刘剑青可和不和而力求“背城借一”，结果又败一阵，决赛权遂被王嘉良、刘剑青所得。第四组广东杨官璘与辽宁孟立国同获晋级，也非轻易幸致，而是直到最末一轮杨战胜陕西王羽屏、孟战和云南邓鹏才算定局。
    甘肃武延福“初出茅庐”，不为侯玉山威名所震，沉着进击，卒破强敌，这种精神是可喜的。
    王嘉良对刘忆慈一局，刘先用他的熟套“仙人指路”布局，到第四个回合刘补中炮时，王的应着不是常套的马八进七，而是相七进五甘弃中兵，这一着出乎寻常，刘忆慈的一套算盘就不得不重新打过，使刘忆慈费尽了脑汁。又如孟立国后手对杨官璘的中炮、巡河炮，应法也是一变常规：不是兑三路兵或还以巡河炮，而乃飞右相、开横车，尽管这一应法的最后评价还有待于仔细检验才可作出，但小孟敢想敢试的精神总是可嘉的。
    最后，特别值得一提的，是运动员们大都能正确体会竞赛的意义，不是斤斤于追求个人的名次，而是“各尽所能”，力求下出最好的棋。例如河南的老将马金魁，不但屡败屡战，而且愈战愈强。被人戏称为“三朝元老”（1956、57、58年都获得优秀名次）的刘忆慈，失去晋级权后，在最末一轮中仍然施展“浑身解数”力挫广西唐家鹏，绝无垂头丧气迹象。其他如湖南李定一、山西王庆杰，还有别的同志，也都是如此。这样优良的运动道德品质，是党和各代表团领导同志不断关怀教育的丰硕之果。
　　从20日下午起，八名晋级的运动员已开始循环对垒，一定会有更多更精采的佳局出现。
