Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd: Autumn harvesting has generally begun in Jilin. As of the 19th, the province had harvested more than 2.56 million mu of millet, foxtail millet, sorghum, and other crops. A production increase and frugality movement with "harvest well, thresh well, collect well, sell well, distribute well, and store well" as its main content is developing in depth in the rural areas of the province.

This year, the autumn crops in Jilin Province are generally characterized by strong stalks, numerous plants, large ears, and full grains. A scene of abundant harvest is presented everywhere. Siping Special District, which once suffered from severe drought, overcame the drought by relying on the strength of the people's communes, ensuring the normal growth of crops. It is estimated that this year's grain output can increase by about 20% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Among the 1,156 management areas in Baicheng Special District, 67% can increase production by 10% to 20% compared with last year, and the rest can increase production by more than 20%.

Full of enthusiasm, well prepared, and early start are the prominent features of this year's autumn harvest in Jilin Province. Based on the dense planting, strong stalks, and numerous farm tasks this autumn, various localities began autumn harvest preparations as early as the beginning of August. Once the autumn harvest season arrived, various localities started harvesting in a timely manner. In order to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, many people's communes, management areas, and production teams established autumn harvest inspection teams, established autumn protection and harvest preservation conventions, and formulated autumn harvest operating procedures. Jiangmifeng People's Commune in Yongji County proposed methods for careful harvesting and threshing to save grain, mainly: timely harvesting, harvesting one piece at a time, handling gently; not losing bean pods when harvesting beans, leaving short stubble when harvesting millet; picking sorghum and laying sacks, laying mats on carts pulling crops, and putting muzzles on livestock threshing; assigning special personnel to manage threshing grounds to prevent pigs and poultry from trampling grain; organizing the elderly and children to pick up crops.

All localities in the province, in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and reasonable arrangement," are transferring troops and generals to enrich the autumn harvest front. Chengfa People's Commune in Yushu County decided to adopt the method of using strong to replace weak and women to replace men, drawing 690 strong laborers from the logistics, industry, and sideline departments to participate in the autumn harvest; according to the different labor abilities of commune members, professional teams for harvesting, transporting, and grain picking were formed, the responsibility system was improved, and work, people, and remuneration were determined according to the land; threshing grounds were set up at the edge of the fields, harvesting and threshing on the spot, saving transportation power.

### 干劲足　准备好　动手早  吉林处处开镰忙

    干劲足　准备好　动手早
    吉林处处开镰忙
    新华社长春22日电　吉林秋收普遍开始。到19日止，全省已经收割了二百五十六万多亩糜子、谷子、高粱等作物。一个以“割好，打好，收好，交售好，分配好，保管好”为主要内容的增产节约运动，正在全省农村深入展开。
    今年，吉林省秋田作物的生长情况，比较普遍的是秸稞粗壮，株多穗大，籽粒饱满。各地呈现一片丰收景象，曾经发生严重干旱的四平专区，由于依靠人民公社的力量，战胜了干旱，保证了农作物正常生长，今年粮食产量据估计可以比大跃进的1958年增产二成左右。白城专区的一千一百五十六个管理区中，有67％可以比去年增产一成到二成，其余的可以增产二成以上。
    干劲足，准备好，动手早，是吉林省今年秋收中的突出特点。各地根据今年作物植株密、秸稞粗壮和今秋农活繁多等的情况。早在8月上旬就及早进行秋收准备。秋收季节一到，各地都适时地开镰收割。为了做到细收细打，很多人民公社、管理区、生产队成立了秋收检查小组，建立了护秋保收公约，并制定了秋收操作规程。永吉县江蜜蜂人民公社提出了细收细打节约粮食的办法，主要是：及时收割、熟一块割一块、轻拿轻放；割豆不丢荚、割谷短留槎；掐高粱铺麻袋，拉庄稼的大车铺席子，打场的牲口带兜嘴；专人看管场院，防止猪禽遭蹋粮食；组织老年、儿童拣庄稼。
    全省各地都本着“统筹兼顾，合理安排”的原则，调兵遣将，充实秋收战线。榆树县城发人民公社，决定采取以强代弱，以女代男的办法，从后勤、工业、副业部门中抽出六百九十名强壮劳力参加秋收；根据社员不同劳动能力，编成收割、运输、拣粮等专业队，健全责任制，按地定活、定人、定报酬；田边设场院，就地收割，就地打场，节省运输力量。
