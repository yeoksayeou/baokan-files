    Building the Motherland's Railways Quickly, Well, and Economically
    Railway Soldiers Launch a Four-Comparison Competition
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd -- After studying the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army resolved to wage a great battle in September, launching a production increase and economy drive centered on high yield, high quality, economy, and safety, to build the motherland's railways quickly, well, and economically.
    From January to the end of August, the Railway Corps completed engineering investments that increased by 58% compared to the same period last year. Earth and stone work increased nearly threefold compared to the same period last year, bridge engineering increased by 76%, and tunnel excavation completed more than 11,800 meters. During this study, officers and soldiers resolved to advance victoriously and create even greater achievements. Based on the demands of the officers and soldiers, the leading organs of the Railway Corps proposed launching a vigorous "four-comparison" competition in September, comparing high yield, high quality, economy, and safety.
    The construction units scattered throughout the north and south of the motherland made full preparations at the end of August to meet the new high tide of road construction in September. The troops building the Nei(jiang)-Kun(ming) Railway on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau made a construction plan for September in advance, determined key engineering projects, and allocated sufficient manpower, machinery, and materials. The "Yang Lian-di Company" vigorously promoted technological innovation, universally promoting the advanced experience of concrete pouring with steel towers, ensuring the completion of 2,800 cubic meters of earth, wood, and stone in September, an increase of 5% over the original quota. A certain detachment that pioneered a new record of 232 meters of tunnel excavation per month by the Railway Corps during the "Red May" labor competition recently broke the original record with a score of 260 meters of tunnel excavation per month. In response to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee to launch a production increase and economy campaign, the automobile company of this detachment launched a safety transport of 10,000-ton kilometers competition, determined to increase the monthly transport volume from 3,500 tons to 8,000 tons. The troops constructing the Xiang-Qian Railway have decided to promote "high bridge without scaffolding" and "rubble masonry grouting method" in the construction of bridges and culverts, and to promote advanced technologies and methods such as pneumatic drills and pneumatic drill supports in tunnel operations to welcome the "September Battle." The troops building the Liaoyang-Benxi railway double track in Northeast China have organized technical innovation groups for tunnels and bridges and improved construction organization. At the same time, the troops have also started to check safety work. To ensure the supply of materials and improve transportation capacity, many troops have also adopted measures such as double-shift transportation, quick loading and unloading, and the use of water transportation.

    多快好省地修建祖国的铁路
    铁道兵掀起四比竞赛
    新华社2日讯　人民解放军铁道兵部队，学习了党的八届八中全会的公报和决议以后，决心大战9月，掀起一个以高产、优质、节约、安全为中心内容的增产节约运动，多快好省地修建祖国的铁路。
    从1月到8月下旬，铁道兵完成的工程投资，比去年同期增加了58％，土石方工程比去年同期增加了近三倍，桥梁工程增加了76％，隧道成洞完成了一万一千八百多米。在这次学习中，官兵们决心乘胜前进，创造更大成就。铁道兵领导机关根据官兵们的要求，提出在9月份开展轰轰烈烈的比高产、比优质、比节约、比安全的“四比”竞赛。
    分散在祖国南北各地的施工部队，为了迎战9月份的筑路新高潮，8月底都作了充分的准备。在云贵高原上修建内（江）昆（明）铁路的部队，提前作出了9月份的施工计划，确定了重点工程项目，配备了足够的人力、机械和材料。“杨连第连”大闹技术革新，普遍推广钢塔架注混凝土的先进经验，保证9月份完成土木石方二千八百立方，比原来定额提高5％。在“红五月”劳动竞赛中，首创铁道兵隧道月成洞二百三十二米新纪录的某支队，最近又以月成洞二百六十米的成绩刷新了原纪录。这个支队的汽车连，为了响应八届八中全会关于开展增产节约运动的号召，开展了安全运输万吨公里的竞赛，决心将月运输量从三千五百吨提高到八千吨。在湘黔铁路线上施工的部队，已决定在桥梁、涵洞的施工中，推广“高桥无脚手架”、“片石挤浆法”，在隧道作业中推广手风枪、风枪支架等先进技术和方法，迎接“9月大战”。在东北修建辽阳——本溪铁路复线的部队，已组织了隧道、桥梁技术革新小组，并改善了施工组织。在这同时，各部队还着手检查了安全工作。为了保证材料供应，提高运输能力，许多部队还采取了双班运输、快装快卸、利用水上运输等措施。
