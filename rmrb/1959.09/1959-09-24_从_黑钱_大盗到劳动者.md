    From "Black Money" Thief to Laborer
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang Zhuofei
    At the National Exhibition of Labor Reform for Criminals, there is an event that viewers call a miracle: a well-known "black money" thief from Tianjin, with over twenty years of theft history, has now been transformed into a laborer—a fifth-grade kiln operator.
    There are many such noteworthy stories at the exhibition, which arouse a strong interest in seeing how these people have been transformed under the influence of revolutionary humanitarianism. Fortunately, this "black money" thief came to Beijing from Tianjin to visit the exhibition. Taking this opportunity, I interviewed him in the exhibition office. His name is Zhao Jinming.
    Zhao Jinming is quite tall, with thick eyebrows and large eyes. Although his beard is cleanly shaven, you can still see a dark patch. Seeing him as he is now, I couldn't help but conjure up the appearance of those Jiangyang bandits written about in old novels. However, he is no longer a terrifying "black money" thief, but an ordinary laborer.
    This former "black money" thief told me that before liberation, Tianjin had thieves as numerous as hairs, and the variety of types was unimaginable. They can be broadly divided into two categories: those who stole during the day were called "white money," and those who stole at night were called "black money." Zhao Jinming said he was a famous figure among the "black money."
    Zhao Jinming was originally a poor worker, and the pain of unemployment in the old society forced him onto the path of thievery. The first time he stole, he was caught before he even got the money and was sent to prison. At the time, he was a bit frustrated and thought, "This line of work is not for me." However, after staying in prison for a few days, he met a group of new "friends" who taught him the skills of stealing. After being released, he and his new "friends" boldly stole together.
    Once he was determined to pursue this line of work, he was imprisoned several times each year. However, prisons at that time actually became places for training thieves. Each time he was released, his stealing skills rapidly improved, and he quickly transformed from a petty thief into a major thief. In the period before Tianjin's liberation, he was already quite famous, leading a group of petty thieves to steal everywhere in Tianjin. At the time, the police all knew him, but no one arrested him, letting him steal. Zhao Jinming said it well: "Many police officers took large sums of money from me every month. If they arrested me, not only would I have no money to use, but they would have no money either."
    Zhao Jinming spent the stolen money recklessly. He had two concubines and often went to brothels. Gambling was also his addiction, and he could stay in casinos for days and nights. He was heavily addicted to opium, even taking a few puffs while stealing.
    Speaking of this, he couldn't help but exclaim, "Was I even human then? No, I was completely a ghost, a scum of society..."
    He was arrested shortly after Tianjin's liberation. After entering prison, he often thought of escaping and even tried to bribe his way out, but of course, these were just wishful thinking. In prison, the government helped him quit opium, educated him to recognize his past crimes, and then had him participate in labor. During labor, government cadres often talked to him about the principles of being a good person.
    Zhao Jinming, who had been stealing for over twenty years, couldn't listen to anything the government cadres said. He often thought, "Stealing is my lifelong career. Only by stealing can I have money, only by stealing will people call me 'master,' and have food, drink, and convenience."
    Later, the number of prisoners in the prison increased, and his accomplices and apprentices also came in one after another. After entering prison, many people confessed and exposed many thieves. Seeing that the situation was very bad, he thought to himself: it seems that I can't continue in this line of work.
    When he first entered prison, the government cadres educated him, but he wouldn't listen. However, the government's treatment of the prisoners' lives moved him. He said that when he first started stealing, because he had no money, entering prison meant suffering, being beaten and scolded, not having enough to eat during the day, and sleeping in the dirtiest places at night. Now, prisoners live in clean houses, eat well, and are warmly clothed. Regardless of whether they have money or not, everyone is treated the same. Comparing the old and new prisons, he felt that the Communist Party's policies towards prisoners were different from the Kuomintang's.
    Zhao Jinming's ability to have this thought showed that he was beginning to feel some remorse. However, he still had many doubts. Later, he had a serious illness during labor reform and was very afraid. Zhao Jinming said, "At that time, I was thinking wildly in bed, fearing that the government wouldn't treat me and I would die of illness." The reality was completely beyond his expectations. His illness was treated patiently by doctors and quickly cured. He was so moved that he shed tears.
    In labor reform, Zhao Jinming started doing general labor, which not only increased his physical strength but also his weight. One day, a government cadre had a private conversation with him. The cadre told him that the Party and government's labor reform policy was to transform criminals into good laborers. To prevent him from committing crimes in the future and to become self-reliant, he was asked to work at a brick kiln and learn skills there, but he had to be honest and strive to be reformed as soon as possible and become a new person.
    Can prisoners really be allowed to learn skills? Zhao Jinming felt doubtful again. At the time, he verbally agreed, but in his heart, he held a "let's see" attitude. But when he arrived at the kiln, the technicians patiently taught him, without discriminating against him because he was a prisoner. Government cadres also frequently supervised him and educated him to study hard. All of this dispelled his doubts. He felt that the government's labor reform policy for prisoners was humane and was seriously helping prisoners embark on a new life and become new people.
    Under the education of the Party and government's labor reform policy, Zhao Jinming's thinking changed. He could also accept the political and ideological education conducted by the government, recognized his crimes, and realized that stealing was a very shameful act. He also said: "The government cadres' painstaking education also made me understand a great truth: the old society turned me into a ghost, and the new society wants me to become a good person."
    After this, he abandoned the idea of stealing as a lifelong career, no longer wanted to live by stealing, but wanted to live by labor. His labor began to become active, and he also worked hard to learn advanced kiln firing methods in his spare time.
    Zhao Jinming's sentence was five years. He performed well in labor reform, was released half a year early, and was employed in a brick factory, and was rated as a fifth-grade kiln technician, with a monthly salary of more than sixty yuan.
    In the past, when he lived by stealing, indulging in extravagance, he never gave his mother a penny. Now, his heart is kind, and he is fully responsible for his mother's living expenses.
    He also has apprentices now, but he doesn't teach stealing skills, but kiln firing techniques. In two years, he has taught twelve apprentices.
    In his work, he often stays up late into the night to study technology. Soon, he successfully tested the kiln firing method of "directly drying wet bricks into finished products," solving the major problem that kilns could not be fired on rainy days without dry bricks. During the Great Leap Forward last year, he also created an "automatic coal feeder," reducing the labor force from six per shift to three. This reduced coal consumption by 10% and eliminated defective products (black-headed bricks), improving product quality from 90% to 100%.
    Zhao Jinming was rated as an activist in the factory. At an award ceremony, he said excitedly: "I lived like a ghost for the first half of my life. Thanks to the People's Government for saving me and making me a person. In the future, I must always live like a human being!"
    After the interview, he and I went to visit the exhibition together. We saw many people watching a series of comic strips introducing Zhao Jinming's transformation. When the audience learned that he was the former "black money" thief, they all looked at him with surprised eyes. One audience member said: Looking at him now, he really looks like a worker. You can't tell that he used to be a "black money" thief at all. The Communist Party's labor reform policy is really good, transforming bad people for the better.

### 从“黑钱”大盗到劳动者

    从“黑钱”大盗到劳动者
    新华社记者　王濯非
    在全国劳动改造罪犯工作展览会上，有一件被观众称为奇迹的事情：一个有二十多年盗窃历史的天津市有名的“黑钱”大盗，现已被改造成为一个劳动者——五级烧窑技工。
    展览会上有很多这样引人注意的事迹，它们使人发生了浓厚的兴趣，很想看一看这些在革命人道主义的感召下究竟怎样得到改造了的人。巧得很，这位“黑钱”大盗从天津赶到北京来参观展览会。趁这个机会，我在展览会的办公室里访问了他，他的名字叫赵金铭。
    赵金铭个儿挺高，浓眉大眼，脸上的胡子虽已刮得很光，但还可以看出黑黑的一片。看到他现在这副样子，不由得在我脑子里勾划出旧小说里所写的那些江洋大盗的相貌。不过，他现在已不是可怕的“黑钱”大盗，而是一个普通的劳动者了。
    这个前“黑钱”大盗告诉我，解放前的天津，贼多如毛，而其种类之多，是人们难以想像的。总的可分两大类：在白天偷盗的叫“白钱”，在黑夜偷盗的叫“黑钱”。赵金铭说他就是“黑钱”中的有名人物。
    赵金铭原是一个穷苦的工人，旧社会失业的痛苦逼迫他走上了盗贼的道路。他第一次行窃时，钱还没有偷到手就被人抓住，送进了监狱。当时，他有点懊丧，也曾想到“这行饭不是我吃的”。可是，在牢内住了几天，他结识了一伙新“朋友”，他们教他盗窃的本领，出狱以后，他就和新的“朋友”在一起，大胆地偷起来了。
    决心干上了这一行以后，在那些年月里，他每年都要入狱几次。然而，那时的监狱，却实际上成了训练盗贼的场所，他每次出狱，盗窃的本领便迅速地得到了提高，很快地由小偷变成了大盗。天津解放前一段时期，他已赫赫有名了，指挥着一伙小偷，在天津到处行窃。当时，警察都知道他，可是，谁也不去抓他，让他去偷。赵金铭说得好：“很多警察每个月都要从我的手中拿去大把的钞票，他们把我抓去，不仅我没有钱用，他们也没有钱用了。”
    赵金铭把偷来的钱，任意挥霍。他有两个小老婆，还常进妓院。赌博更是他的嗜好，可以几天几夜不离赌场。他吸白面的瘾很大，就是正在盗窃的时候，也要吸他几次。
    他说到这里，不禁感叹地说：“那时我像个人吗？不是的，完全是个鬼，是社会的渣滓……”
    天津解放不久，他就被捕了。他入狱后常想逃跑，也曾想用贿赂的办法跑出监狱，当然这都是妄想。在监狱里，政府帮他戒了白面，教育他认识过去的罪恶，然后让他参加劳动。在劳动中，政府干部还经常给他讲做人的道理。
    干了二十多年窃盗的赵金铭，对政府干部说的话，一点也听不进去。他常这样想：“偷盗是我的终身职业，只有偷，才有钱，只有偷，才有人叫我大爷，有吃有喝，多方便。”
    以后，狱中的犯人增多了，他的同伙和徒弟也一个一个地进来了，许多人进狱以后，坦白作了交代，并且检举了不少盗窃犯。他看到情况大为不妙，心中暗想：看样子，我这一行，恐怕是干不成了。
    他刚入狱时，政府干部对他进行教育，他听不进去。可是，政府对犯人的生活待遇，却使他感动了。他说，我刚做窃盗时，因为没有钱，走进监狱就受罪，挨打挨骂，白天吃不饱肚子，晚上睡在最肮脏的地方。现在，犯人住的是清洁的房子，吃得饱、穿得暖，不问有钱没钱，都是一样待遇。从新旧监狱对比中，他感到共产党对待犯人的政策和国民党不一样。
    赵金铭能够有这个想法，表明他开始有些悔悟了。可是，他的疑虑仍然是很多的。后来，他在劳动改造中，生过一次重病，心中非常害怕。赵金铭说：“当时，我病在床上胡思乱想，就怕政府不给我治，活活地病死。”事实完全出乎他的意料之外，他的病得到了医生耐心的医治，很快就治好了。为此，他感动得流了眼泪。
    赵金铭在劳动改造中，开始做一般的劳动，不但体力有了增加，体重也增加了。有一天，政府干部找他个别谈话。干部对他说，党和政府的劳改政策是要把罪犯改造成为善良的劳动者。为了使他今后不再犯罪，成为自食其力的人，要他到砖窑上去劳动，到那里去学技术，但是必须老老实实，争取早点得到改造，成为新人。
    真的能让犯人去学习技术吗？赵金铭又感到怀疑。当时，他口头答应，心里抱着去“看一看”的态度。可是他到了窑上，技师们耐心地教他，没有因为他是犯人而有所歧视，政府干部更是经常监督他，教育他好好学习。这一切，使他消除了自己的怀疑。他感到政府对犯人的劳改政策是人道的，是在认真地帮助犯人走上新生，重新做人。
    赵金铭在党和政府的劳改政策的教育下，思想转变了。他对政府进行的政治思想教育也能接受了，认识到自己的罪恶，认识到盗窃是非常可耻的行为，他还说：“政府干部的苦口婆心的教育，还使我懂得了一个大道理：旧社会使我变成鬼，新社会要我成好人。”
    在这以后，他抛弃了盗窃作为终身职业的念头，不想以盗窃为生，而想以劳动为生了。他的劳动开始积极起来，还利用工余时间努力学习先进的烧窑法。
    赵金铭刑期五年，在劳动改造中表现较好，提前半年释放，在一个砖瓦厂就业了，并被评为五级烧窑技工，每月工资六十多元。
    过去，他以盗窃为生时，花天酒地，从来没有给他母亲一个钱。现在，他的心地善良了，全部负起他母亲的生活费用。
    他现在也有徒弟，但不是教盗窃技术，而是烧窑的技术。在两年内他教了十二个徒弟。
    在工作中，他常深更半夜地去钻研技术，不久，就试验成功“湿坯直接烧干成为成品”的烧窑法，解决了阴雨天没有干坯就不能烧窑的重大问题。去年大跃进中，他还创造了“自动添煤机”，由原来每班六个劳动力减到三个。使耗煤量降低了10％，并消灭了废品（黑头砖），使产品质量由90％提高到100％。
    赵金铭被评为工厂里的积极分子。在一次发奖大会上，他激动地说：“我前半辈子像鬼一样地活过去了，多亏人民政府救了我，使我成为一个人，今后，我一定要永远做到像人一样地活下去！”
    访问完毕后，他和我一起去参观展览会。我们看到很多人在一组介绍赵金铭转变的连环画前观看。当观众们知道他就是过去的“黑钱”大盗时，都以惊奇的眼光注视他。有一位观众这样说：看他现在的样子真像一个工人，一点也看不出过去是一个“黑钱”大盗，共产党的劳改政策真正好，把坏人改造好了。
