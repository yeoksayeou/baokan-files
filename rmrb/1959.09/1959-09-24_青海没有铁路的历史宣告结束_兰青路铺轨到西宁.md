Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 23rd: The whistle of a train has broken the silence over Xining, Qinghai Province, for the first time. The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway tracks have been laid to Xining Station in Qinghai Province.

On September 22nd, the workers constructing the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway completed the last major bridge on the Hekou-Xining section – the Shataochuan Bridge – ahead of schedule, completing track laying for the entire 175-kilometer section. The first engineering train, decorated with colorful flags, then slowly pulled into Xining Station. Thus, all provincial and autonomous region capitals in China, except for Urumqi and Lhasa, are now connected by rail.

On the 22nd, when the tracks reached Xining Station, more than 3,000 people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Xining rushed to the station to witness the new railway and welcome the new train. At the welcoming rally, Li Fangyuan, member of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, spoke. He first extended warm congratulations and cordial greetings to all the staff and workers of the Xining Railway Bureau on behalf of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee. He went on to say that after the Communiqué and Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, the railway workers opposed Right-leaning tendencies and boosted their morale, completing the plan to lay tracks to Xining by the end of September eight days ahead of schedule. The arrival of the train in Xining has broken the thousands-year-old history of Qinghai without railways and will bring happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province. Chen Xingtian, captain of the track laying and bridge building team of the Xining Railway Bureau, represented all the staff and workers of the track laying and bridge building team at the welcoming rally, resolutely guaranteeing that they would continue to lay tracks westward at high speed.

The Hekou-Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway will begin passenger and freight transportation on National Day. From the 22nd, trains fully loaded with various construction materials and daily necessities are steadily arriving in Xining.

The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway began construction in May 1958. It is 1,400 kilometers long, starting from Hekou Station on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the east and reaching Youshashan in the Qaidam Basin in the west. At present, the key projects west of Xining have already begun construction.

    青海没有铁路的历史宣告结束
    兰青路铺轨到西宁
    新华社西宁23日电　火车的汽笛声第一次划破了宁静的西宁上空。兰青铁路已铺轨到青海省西宁车站。
    9月22日，修建兰青铁路的职工提前架好河口至西宁段最后一座大桥——沙淘川大桥，使这一段一百七十五公里铁路全部铺通。第一列挂着彩旗的工程列车接着缓缓驶进了西宁车站。至此，我国除乌鲁木齐和拉萨以外，其他各省、自治区首府都有铁路相通了。
    22日，当铁轨铺到西宁车站的时候，西宁市各族各界三千多人奔赴车站，观瞻新建的铁路，欢迎新来的火车。在欢迎大会上，中共青海省委委员，青海省副省长李芳远讲了话。他首先代表中共青海省委和青海省人民委员会，向西宁铁路局全体职工致以热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问。他接着说，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布后，铁路职工反右倾、鼓干劲，把原订9月底铺轨到西宁的计划提前八天完成了。火车进入西宁，打破了几千年来青海没有铁路的历史，将给青海省各族人民带来幸福。西宁铁路局铺轨架桥队队长陈杏天，在欢迎大会上代表铺轨架桥队全体职工，坚决保证以高速度继续铺轨西进。
    兰青铁路河口——西宁段将在国庆节开办客、货运输。从22日开始，满载着各种建筑器材和生活用品的列车正源源开来西宁。
    兰青铁路是在1958年5月动工修建的，全长一千四百公里，东起兰新铁路的河口车站，西达柴达木盆地的油砂山。现在，西宁以西的重点工程已经动工修建。
