Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 7th: The Sixth Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) opened in Jakarta this morning. The congress is scheduled to close on the 15th.

    The congress will hear and discuss the Central Committee's political report, discuss and revise the Party Constitution and Program, and elect new central leadership.

    In response to questions from Antara News Agency reporters, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit said that the congress will analyze the current social situation in Indonesia, and therefore will discuss many economic issues, including foreign capital, the Indonesian economic crisis, strengthening the national economy, and raising people's living standards.

    Aidit said that the congress will also discuss strengthening the Indonesian national united front and helping to implement the new cabinet's program.

    Aidit said that he believes it is necessary for the congress to specifically discuss certain basic issues, such as the transition from capitalism to socialism, the balance of power between the capitalist and socialist camps, the current crisis in the capitalist world, the international influence of the socialist camp, and the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The congress will also discuss the implementation of Indonesia's anti-colonialist and peace-loving foreign policy. He said he believes that the Sixth Congress will continue to give sincere support to the current cabinet.

    The Fifth Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party was held in 1954. In the past five years, the Indonesian Communist Party has made great progress, and its prestige has been increasing day by day. It has become one of the four major political parties in Indonesia. In last year's local elections, the Communist Party won the most votes.

    The working people of Indonesia warmly welcomed the convening of this congress. Many farmers, workers, and party sympathizers have donated grain, coffee, fruit, and other items to the congress preparatory committee.

    Many Indonesian government ministers, senior officials, and political figures sent congratulatory messages and letters to the congress. Indonesian Supreme Advisory Council Vice Chairman Abdoelgani said in his congratulatory letter to the congress that he hopes the Sixth Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party will contribute to uniting the progressive and revolutionary forces of Indonesian society. Indonesian Deputy Minister of Manpower Mobilization Sudibjo expressed hope that the congress will strengthen unity to answer the provocations of the imperialists. He said that the imperialists are "now keen on creating discord, carrying out provocations, and pursuing a policy of division among us."
