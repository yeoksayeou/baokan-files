Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 1st. Inspired by the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, more than 100,000 workers in the three major coal mines of Hegang, Jixi, and Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang Province are enthusiastically launching a coal production battle.

In the coal city of Hegang, from Dongshan to Nanshan, from above-ground to underground, from the streets to the alleys, everything is boiling. The slogan "Strive to overfulfill the production target of 335 million tons of coal" resounds in every corner. All coal mines have put forward new production increase and conservation plans, and specific measures to ensure the early overfulfillment of state plans. The Red Flag Youth Coal Mining Team of Xing'an Mine proposed that, on the basis of producing 20,000 tons of coal per month for five consecutive months, they will strive to complete the annual plan by mid-September, increasing coal production for the country by 70,000 tons. The Dong Cunrui Youth Tunneling Team of Dongshan Mine, which has completed its annual task 160 days ahead of schedule, proposed that they will conscientiously study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, make persistent efforts, and seize the last month of the third quarter to achieve a production level of 250 meters of all-rock roadway progress per month.

In the new upsurge of increasing production and producing more and better coal, the workers of Jixi Coal Mine are constantly creating new achievements. On the 26th, the workers of Class C working underground in the Xiaohengshan Mine launched a midnight coal grabbing battle. They did not let go of a single minute, and each work process was tightly linked, resulting in the entire shift mining 2,320 tons of coal overnight, an increase of 40% compared with Class A. The production of the workers of Pashan Mine has also been particularly outstanding in the past few days, achieving overproduction in every well and a bumper harvest for every team. Now, all mines are revising and promoting the planning of advanced experiences, determined to work hard in September and create more outstanding achievements to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Inspired by the call of the Party, the workers of Lingxi Mine in Shuangyashan formulated production measures and wrote letters of determination overnight, unanimously expressing their determination to produce more and better coal with greater enthusiasm. They have already put forward an annual production leap forward plan, increasing the raw coal production target from 1.17 million tons to 1.26 million tons. The workers of the Shuangyashan Coal Washing Plant also proposed to complete the production task of the third quarter six days ahead of schedule, ensuring the increased production of more washed coal to support the steel industry.

	Shandong Coal Mine Workers Leap Again and Again
		Continuously Break the 60,000 Tons Daily Production Mark

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 3rd. Since August 27th, the coal mine workers in Shandong Province have continuously broken the 60,000 tons daily coal production mark. They completed the August plan half a day ahead of schedule, producing about 200,000 tons more raw coal than in July.

Currently, the production increase and conservation competition movement among the workers of various coal mines is vigorously unfolding. Leading cadres at all levels have also gone deep into the mines to work alongside the workers, while solving key problems in production. In the mines under the Zibo Mining Bureau alone, more than 230 leading cadres have gone deep into the mines to cultivate "experimental plots," breaking through major key problems such as chute accidents together with the workers and the masses. The organization of daily production work has also been strengthened.

Since the beginning of this year, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, the hundreds of thousands of coal mine workers in Shandong Province have enthusiastically carried out a production increase and conservation movement centered on large-scale high yields, making coal production leap again and again. All localities have also resolutely implemented the "walking on two legs" policy, giving full play to the production capacity of large mines such as Zibo and Zaozhuang, and building large mines, while vigorously rectifying, consolidating, and transforming the hundreds of small coal kilns that showed great power in the mass-based coal production last year, gradually putting them on the road to mechanization and semi-mechanization. At present, 60 pairs of small coal wells in the province have embarked on regularized production after equipping a certain number of mechanical equipment; in addition, dozens of pairs of small wells are being actively reconstructed. Some large mines have also built satellite wells, which have played a great role in the rapid growth of output. In the first seven months of this year, the province produced more than 12 million tons of coal for the country, exceeding the output of the same period last year by 1.3 times, which strongly supported the key enterprises in Shanghai, Wuhan and other places, as well as the industrial and agricultural production in the province.

	Jilin Chemical Industry Production Indicators Are Repeatedly Increased
		To Increase Production and Conserve 20 Million Yuan for the Country This Year

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 3rd. More than 30,000 employees of Jilin Chemical Industry Company have held various meetings in recent days, enthusiastically discussing and formulating new production increase and conservation plans. They proposed: to increase production and conserve 20 million yuan this year; the output of eight major products will increase by 2.5% to 18.9% respectively compared with the state plan; and the total cost will be reduced by another 4% compared with the original plan.

The company's employees are full of confidence in achieving this leap forward plan. The employees of the fertilizer plant have proposed and started implementing 35 technical innovation projects in the past few days. The change of the gas generator from producing water gas to producing semi-water gas alone can increase the efficiency of each gas generator by more than 30%. After the implementation of these innovation measures, the entire plant, from the gas production workshop to the last workshop producing products, can overfulfill the annual chemical fertilizer production increase task without increasing equipment. The employees of the dye factory have recently formed a "three-in-one" commando team of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and are focusing on tackling the weak links in production. After the leading cadres, workers, and technicians of the second section of the second intermediate workshop studied and unified the three-shift operation and strictly controlled the temperature increase operation method, the production steadily increased, and the average daily output of nitroanisole increased by nearly one time. After the production increase and conservation plan of the calcium carbide plant is implemented to each worker, it is currently grasping specific guarantee measures and launching competitions between posts. The August production increase plan of the coking workshop was overfulfilled by 6.5% three days ahead of schedule, and the daily production plan has been completed very well every day after the competition.

	The Losses Caused by the Typhoon Must Be Taken Back
		Xiamen General Machinery Factory Resumes Production Quickly

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 3rd. The employees of Xiamen General Machinery Factory have overcome the typhoon twice and quickly resumed production completely, demonstrating the working class's spirit of fighting against difficulties with heroism and tenacity. At present, all the employees of the factory are setting off a vigorous production upsurge to respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

On August 23, Xiamen City was hit by a typhoon that had not been seen in 40 years. Xiamen General Machinery Factory was one of the factories that suffered relatively severe damage. The factory buildings of two workshops were blown down by the wind, and the roof tiles of the remaining factory buildings were all blown off by the typhoon. The factory's power poles were broken, and half a month's products and some equipment in the foundry workshop were damaged. However, despite such heavy losses, the employees of this factory did not shake their confidence in the Great Leap Forward in the slightest. On the contrary, they fought against the disaster with greater enthusiasm and heroic and tenacious spirit. After the typhoon weakened, the factory's Party committee immediately issued a call to all employees to rely on their own efforts and quickly resume production. Communist Party member Cao Mengjia, Communist Youth League member Jiang Yuchang, and others rescued motors and other machines from the rubble in the rain; the old lathe operator and Communist Party member Lin Hongcheng's family suffered very serious disasters, but he was the first to participate in the factory's rescue. Advanced producer Tang Jiaxi organized a youth commando team to climb onto the roof to repair the factory's roof tiles; the factory buildings, except for the collapsed parts, were repaired by the workers themselves within one day.

On the 29th, a strong typhoon from the Pacific Ocean struck Xiamen again. Under the strong leadership of the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the workers of the General Machinery Factory immediately took emergency measures. More than 300 workers in the factory stayed in the factory and insisted on protecting the factory. They built protective frames on the machines with wood to prevent damage to the machines. The factory's leading cadres also stayed with the workers all night, launching a tenacious struggle against the strong typhoon again, and insisted on production.

In the past few days, workshops of Xiamen General Machinery Factory have held rallies one after another. The workers said: "We must take back the losses caused by the typhoon!" They all expressed that they would strive to complete and overfulfill the production plans for the third quarter and the whole year, and respond to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions. Advanced producer Shao Hanchi guaranteed to complete three years' worth of work in one year. On the 27th, when he was processing the "hob" workpiece, he used advanced experience and adopted a fast cutting method to complete 60 hours of work in 8 hours. The workers of the first lathe group further revised the leap forward indicators, and proposed five initiatives such as striving to complete 250 man-hours of work every day, and challenged the brother groups. On the 27th, their group completed 347 man-hours of work with 113 man-hours. The Tang Jiaxi Youth Commando team, which made outstanding achievements in the rescue work, completed 526 man-hours of work with 138 man-hours in production. The production volume of the entire machine and fitter workshop has increased by more than half compared to before the disaster.

	Determined to Increase Production of 450,000 Cubic Meters of Wood
		The Party's Call Shines in the Greater Khingan Mountains

Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, September 2nd. More than 90,000 employees of the Greater Khingan Mountains Forest Area in Inner Mongolia are determined to continue to go all out, improve labor productivity, and strive to increase wood production by 450,000 cubic meters for the country by the end of the year, and further do a good job in rushing to transport wood.

In August, all the employees of the forest area completed the monthly timber production plan 7.7% ahead of schedule.

In August, through hard struggle, they overcame various difficulties such as many mosquitoes, much rain, and muddy roads in the forest area. After the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party reached the forest area, it inspired the enthusiasm of the employees even more. At present, the timber production of various forestry bureaus is constantly rising. The Xiniqi Forestry Bureau has produced more than 4,400 cubic meters of timber for the country since it completed the annual plan five months ahead of schedule at the end of July. They decided to increase timber production by more than 61,000 cubic meters throughout the year.

	Qaidam Petroleum Workers Launch 10,000-Person Oil Seizure Battle
		Crude Oil Production Last Month Was More Than Five Times the Total Production Last Year

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 2nd. The crude oil produced by the petroleum workers in Qaidam, Qinghai in August was more than five times the total production last year. The daily output has broken through the 1,000-ton mark.

In recent months, the Qinghai Petroleum Administration Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted the policy of shortening the front line and concentrating forces, drawing more than 10,000 oil extraction, drilling workers, and technical cadres from other exploration areas, and concentrating a large number of drilling rigs, equipment, and vehicles to attack the Lenghu Oil Area and increase crude oil production. Dozens of drilling teams that have been transferred are drilling wells in the Lenghu area. Among them, 13 medium and deep drilling teams are concentrated in the high-yield area to drill production wells. Oil extraction workers have strengthened oil well management and maintenance work, and light drilling teams have been drawn to form professional well repair teams to be responsible for dealing with problematic wells, so that the output of each well can be stabilized and improved.

In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's crude oil production tasks, the employees of the Qinghai Petroleum Administration have launched a 10,000-person oil seizure battle. The secretary and director of the administration have personally gone to the front line of production to strengthen the leadership of oil extraction and drilling work. Important departments such as oil extraction, refining, transportation, oil storage, and transportation are cooperating closely to ensure the smooth progress of production. Each oil selection station and motorcade cooperate closely to quickly transport the crude oil out.

In recent years, the petroleum industry department has carried out large-scale geological exploration work in the Qaidam area, found the Lenghu No. 5 Oilfield, and explored high-yield areas, which has laid a good foundation for the current large-scale exploitation.

	Tianjin Knitting Factory Tries Every Means to Increase Variety
		Guarantees to Produce 80,000 Pieces of New Style Products in September

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 3rd. The employees of Tianjin Knitting Factory are determined to produce more and better knitted products to supply the needs of people all over the country. At present, the competition centered on high quality, high yield, conservation, and variety is in full swing in the factory. The product qualification rate has increased from the planned 97% to 97.16%.

After the publication of the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workshops of the factory held martial arts competitions one after another, submitted letters of determination and guarantees to the Party Committee, challenged and responded to each other, and leading cadres at all levels also went deep into the workshops to direct production. City labor model and sewing worker Tao Jinlan used to cut more than 500 pieces every day, exceeding the quota by about 10%. On the 26th, she cut more than 600 pieces in seven hours. Weaver Yu Honglin used to watch six cones. Now, he has improved his working methods and watched eleven cones alone. Ren Jinming, an advanced producer in the knitting workshop who has maintained high quality, high yield, and low consumption for five consecutive months, visited Jin Zhiming, a city labor model who has comprehensively overfulfilled the plan for 39 consecutive months, three times in the competition, learned his "tour cross machine watching method," improved his own operation, and his output exceeded the quota every day, and the quality also improved.

The sewing workshop is an important link in the factory's conservation of raw materials and materials consumption. All tailoring workers and sewing workers launched a clever tailoring competition of "using less material to cut more clothes," and each group improved the design and everyone used materials reasonably. The old worker of cutting velvet pants, Men Fusheng, painstakingly studied and improved the pattern, and adopted the nested cutting method to make full use of the leftover materials, which can save more than 14,800 meters of material throughout the year, and can produce more than 12,000 velvet clothes. The workers in this workshop have put forward more than 300 "clever tailoring" suggestions, which are expected to save more than 500 pieces of cotton yarn throughout the year after implementation, and can produce more than 482,000 pieces of knitted clothing.

The designers of this factory also try every means to increase the variety according to market needs. The garment design team completed the design materials of five new products ahead of schedule in August; six of the recently newly designed 13 new products have been put into production. All the employees of the factory guarantee to produce 80,000 pieces of new style products at the end of September to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. (Attached picture)
