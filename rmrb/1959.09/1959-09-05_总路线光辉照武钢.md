The airwaves carried the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and Wuhan Steel immediately erupted. All employees of the company are determined to respond to the Party's call, hold high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward, and advance bravely.

The iron smelting system will ensure that the sintering plant and the ore dressing plant are completed and put into production as soon as possible, so that the two world-class blast furnaces that have been built can quickly reach their designed production level and exert their enormous power.

The steelmaking system will ensure the completion of dozens of steelmaking projects centered on two large open-hearth furnaces ahead of schedule, allowing them to participate in the steel-grabbing battle as soon as possible.

The steel rolling system is determined to start the construction of the primary rolling, large-scale, and plate rolling projects ahead of schedule, and to speed up the construction, so that the high-quality ore from Daye Iron Mine can be extracted and quickly transformed into steel plates, steel rails, and large steel materials through the assembly line.

Production workers fighting day and night beside blast furnaces, coke ovens, and mines have proposed to complete this year's Great Leap Forward plan for the production of iron, coke, and ore ahead of schedule.

One hundred thousand employees are of one mind: to quickly equip Wuhan Steel—this new steel giant—and fight to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and to catch up with Britain ahead of schedule!

What an inspiring thing this is! The resolution made overnight by the Wuhan Steel Party Committee specifically mentioned that last year, the Party's general line for socialist construction and the slogan of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years have yielded fruitful results in Wuhan Steel.

Originally, Wuhan Steel planned to complete the first phase of the project in 1961, with the first blast furnace put into production on July 1, 1959. After the Party put forward the general line for socialist construction, Wuhan Steel builders actively revised the plan, merging the two phases of the project into one phase of construction, and advancing the date of completion of the first blast furnace to October 1, 1958. At that time, some reporters from capitalist countries who came to Wuhan Steel for interviews expressed doubts about their Great Leap Forward plan, believing that it was impossible to achieve. However, the workers of Wuhan Steel, inspired by the general line, automatically put forward the slogan of hard work, solid work, and ingenious work, and put forward thousands of technical innovation proposals, working continuously day and night regardless of sunny or rainy weather, or the cold or heat. As a result, Daye Iron Mine, which serves the blast furnace, was put into production half a year ahead of schedule, and No. 1 coke oven was put into production nine months ahead of schedule. On September 13, 1958, Wuhan Steel employees welcomed the great people's leader Chairman Mao's inspection of Wuhan Steel with the achievement of producing the first molten iron! By July of this year, Wuhan Steel had completed two blast furnaces, three coke ovens, and many corresponding projects, producing more than 400,000 tons of pig iron and more than 800,000 tons of coke. Wuhan Steel has completed 45% of the workload of the two phases of the project and has entered a new stage of fighting for steel and materials.

The general line for socialist construction has blossomed brilliantly in the minds of Wuhan Steel builders. In the past, in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, the installation of large equipment was carried out using the "component installation method," that is, assembling components one by one on the foundation. Wuhan Steel builders listened to the suggestion of young foreman Guo Chengzhi to adopt the "combined installation" method, that is, assembling the purchased components into a whole on the open space, and then hoisting them onto the foundation. This can shorten the construction period for installing a car dumper from ninety days to forty-five days. The quality meets the design requirements. This style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act immediately spread throughout the Wuhan Steel construction site, making all projects done quickly and well. This year, metal structure hoisting workers have further developed this "combined installation" method, pre-assembling the seventy-eight rings of steel plates of the hot blast stove into twenty-three large rings on the ground, and adopting the new method of "hoisting, aligning, and welding simultaneously" created by welder Li Huanbo, hoisting worker Li Dengxiang, foreman Zhang Xinglie, and others, so that the three 40-meter-high hot blast stove bodies soared into the air in five days, and the quality was excellent. The construction period of Wuhan Steel's No. 2 blast furnace was only four months and two days, while in the past it generally took eight to ten months.

Now, the Party has put forward new combat tasks. Wuhan Steel builders use the experience of the Great Leap Forward, concentrate superior forces, and fight a major battle in steelmaking projects. To complete the open-hearth furnace ahead of schedule, there is a shortage of installation personnel. The riveting and welding plant, which is responsible for heavy manufacturing tasks, immediately dispatched 150 people to the open-hearth furnace construction site and unconditionally handed over all personnel, machines, and tools to the command of the industrial installation company. Jiang Xinhe, Li Huanbo, Wang Chenlie, and many other heroes who have made great achievements in the construction of blast furnaces have also gathered at the steelmaking construction site. The most laborious part of the project is the installation of the 350-ton crane girder, which weighs thirty to forty tons and must be supported by one hundred and twenty sleepers before it can be hoisted. The famous Jiang Xinhe hoisting team took on this arduous task as soon as they went into battle. They used a winch to hook up the steel beam, and then two tower cranes lifted it into the air, opening up the difficult situation of hoisting the crane girder. After formulating the Great Leap Forward plan, the Dong Guangheng team immediately tried to transport the overly tall girder horizontally into the factory overnight, completing the task of hoisting two large girders in one shift. The Sun Yefa team even managed to make various preparations in advance, creating a record of installing and hoisting three girders, more than 100 tons of steel, in one shift.

In the past two days, good news has been coming from all over Wuhan Steel. The industrial installation company, which is responsible for more than 1,000 tons of steel structure tasks for the steelmaking plant, completed its August plan five days ahead of schedule. Leading cadres of Daye Iron Mine went deep into the front line of production and, together with the workers, improved the sieve equipment, so that the daily output of lump ore increased by an average of more than 800 tons, and the powder content decreased by 2%. The sintering plant has also completed the joint trial run and is about to be put into production….

The Party's general line for socialist construction is like a lighthouse on the ocean, guiding Wuhan Steel builders to ride the wind and waves and leap forward!

    总路线光辉照武钢
    本报记者　曹葆铭　袁者萍
    空中的电波传来党的八届八中全会的公报，武钢立即沸腾起来了。全公司职工决心响应党的号召，高举大跃进的红旗奋勇前进。
    炼铁系统保证尽快将烧结厂、选矿厂先后建成投入生产，让已经建起的两座世界第一流的大高炉迅速达到设计生产水平，发挥出巨大的威力。
    炼钢系统保证把两座大平炉为中心的数十项炼钢工程提前建成，让它早日参加夺钢战斗。
    轧钢系统决心将初轧、大型、板轧三大工程提前动工，并且加快建设速度，让大冶铁山的优质矿石，开采出来，就能通过流水作业线，迅速变成钢板、钢轨和大型钢材。
    日夜战斗在高炉、焦炉旁和矿山上的生产工人，提出要提前完成今年生产铁、焦炭和矿石的跃进计划。
    十万职工一条心：让武钢——这个新的钢铁巨人迅速装备停当，为提前完成第二个五年计划而战，为提前赶上英国而战！
    这是多么激励人心的事！武钢党委连夜作出的决议中，特别谈到：去年，党提出的社会主义建设总路线和在十五年内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国水平的口号，已在武钢结出了丰硕的成果。
    本来，武钢原计划在1961年建成第一期工程，第一座高炉在1959年7月1日投入生产。党提出社会主义建设总路线以后，武钢建设者们积极修改计划，把两期工程合并为一期建设，将第一座高炉建成的日期提前到1958年10月1日。当时，有些来武钢采访的资本主义国家的记者，对他们的跃进计划表示怀疑，认为不可能实现。但是，为总路线所鼓舞的武钢工人们自动提出苦干实干加巧干的口号，提出成千上万的技术革新建议，不分晴雨寒暑，日夜连续施工。结果，为高炉服务的大冶铁矿提前半年投入生产，一号焦炉提前九个月投入生产。1958年9月13日，武钢职工以流出第一炉铁水的成就，迎接了伟大人民领袖毛主席到武钢视察！到今年7月，武钢已建成了两座高炉，三座焦炉和相应的许多工程，生产了四十多万吨生铁和八十多万吨焦炭。武钢已完成了两期工程的45％的工作量，进入了为钢、为材而战的新阶段。
    社会主义建设总路线在武钢建设者的思想上开出了灿烂的花朵。过去在鞍钢的建设中，安装一台大型设备，都是采用“分件安装法”，即在基础上一件一件地拼装构件。武钢的建设者听取青年工长郭成志建议采用“组合安装”的办法，将购件在空地上拼装成整体，再往基础上吊装。这样可以使安装一台翻车机的工期由九十天缩短为四十五天。质量符合设计要求。这种敢想敢说敢干的风格立即在武钢工地传播开来，使各项工程都做得又快又好。今年，金属结构吊装工人又发展了这种“组合安装”法，把热风炉的七十八圈钢板事先在地面拼装为二十三大圈，并采用电焊工厉焕波、吊装工李登香、工长张行烈等人创造的“边吊装、边找正、边焊接”的新方法，使三座四十多米高的热风炉炉体五天就耸入空中，而且质量优良。武钢二号高炉的建设工期只有四个月零二天，而过去一般情况需要八至十个月。
    现在，党又提出了新的战斗任务。武钢建设者们运用大跃进的经验，集中优势力量，大战炼钢工程。要提前建成平炉，安装人员有些不足。担负着繁重的制造任务的铆焊厂，立即派出一百五十人到平炉工地，并且无条件地连人带机具全交工业安装公司指挥。江新河、厉焕波、王臣烈等许多在高炉建设中立下战功的英雄们，也陆续会聚在炼钢工地。工程中最吃力的是安装三百五十吨的行车梁，一块就有三、四十吨重，还必须用一百二十根枕木托起来，才能往上吊装。著名的江新河吊装小组一上阵，就担负起这个繁重任务，他们用绞磨将钢梁钩起，再由两台塔式吊机举向高空，打开了吊装行车梁的困难局面。董光恒小组在订出跃进计划以后，立时想法把个头太高的大梁平放着连夜赶运进厂，一班完成了吊装两块大梁的任务，孙业发小组更设法事先做好各种准备，创造了一班装吊三块、一百多吨钢梁的纪录。
    这两天，武钢到处捷报频传。担负着炼钢厂一千多吨钢结构任务的工业安装公司，提前五天完成了8月份的计划。大冶铁矿领导干部深入生产第一线，同工人一起改进了筛子设备，使块矿的日产量平均提高八百多吨，含粉率降低2％。烧结厂也联合试车完毕，即将投入生产……。
    党的社会主义建设总路线，像海洋上的一座灯塔，指示着武钢建设者乘风破浪，飞跃前进！
