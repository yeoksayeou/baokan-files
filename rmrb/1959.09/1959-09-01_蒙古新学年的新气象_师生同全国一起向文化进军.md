Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar Electric Dispatch In the new academic year of 1959-1960, schools at all levels in the Mongolian People's Republic will further implement the policy of combining teaching with productive labor, adding courses related to production technology, and cultivating students' habits of learning science and loving labor.

The First Deputy Minister of Education of Mongolia, Heluo, told our reporter that the new academic year differs from previous years in that it begins in a situation where agricultural and pastoral collectivization has been basically realized throughout the country and the people of the whole country are enthusiastically carrying out the movement to advance towards culture. This will promote a new atmosphere in education.

Heluo said that the new academic year faces the important task of mobilizing teachers and students across the country to advance towards culture. The Ministry of Education has already drafted a plan for advancing towards culture. Teachers and students should not only improve their own cultural level but also help the people improve their culture, and carry out publicity and education among the masses on hygiene and civilized living. This year, preparations for the start of school at all levels have been completed. During the summer vacation, teachers and students in urban and rural schools went to factories, construction sites, farms, and cooperatives to participate in productive labor, and some schools built their own school buildings. During the summer vacation, the provinces also convened short-term studies for school teachers to discuss how to implement the policy of combining teaching with productive labor, and made full preparations for the teaching work in the new academic year.

Heluo said that more than ten primary and secondary schools have been added this year. There are now more than 400 primary and secondary schools in the country. Primary and secondary school students will start their new school year on September 1st. University students will participate in a month of labor and go to farms to help with the autumn harvest, and then officially start classes on October 1st.

    蒙古新学年的新气象
    师生同全国一起向文化进军
    据新华社乌兰巴托电　在1959—1960年度的新学年里，蒙古人民共和国各级学校将进一步贯彻教学和生产劳动相结合的方针，增添有关生产技术的课程，培养学生学习科学和热爱劳动的习惯。
    蒙古教育部第一副部长赫尔洛对本社记者发表谈话说，新学年和往年不同的是：它是在全国已基本实现了农牧业合作化和全国人民热烈开展向文化进军的运动的形势下开始的。这将促使教育工作出现新的气象。
    赫尔洛说，新学年面临着发动全国师生向文化进军的重要任务。教育部已经拟定了向文化进军的草案，师生们不仅要提高自己的文化水平，还要帮助人民群众提高文化，并向群众进行关于讲卫生、过文明生活的宣传教育。今年，各级学校的开学准备工作都已就绪。暑假期间，城乡学校的教师和学生们分别到工厂、建筑工地、农牧场和合作社参加劳动生产，有些学校自己修建了校舍。在暑假中，各省还召集了学校教师进行短期学习，讨论了如何贯彻教学和生产劳动相结合的方针，对于新学年的教学工作作了充分准备。
    赫尔洛说，今年增加了十多所中小学，全国现在已有四百多所中小学校，中小学生们将从9月1日开始新学年的生活，高等学校学生们将参加一个月的劳动，到农牧场帮助秋收，然后在10月1日正式上课。
