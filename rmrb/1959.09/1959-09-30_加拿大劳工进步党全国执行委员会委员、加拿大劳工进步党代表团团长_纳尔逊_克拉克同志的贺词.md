Dear Comrades and Friends:

	At this historic moment celebrating the tenth anniversary of your liberation, we bring the warmest fraternal congratulations from the Labor-Progressive Party, the communist party of Canada, to the Chinese people.

	Your victory over the combined forces of imperialism, feudal landlords, and the Four Big Families is a victory for all workers worldwide. The reactionaries and warmongers, led by U.S. imperialism, have suffered a heavy blow from which they will never recover.

	We join you in solemnly mourning the thousands upon thousands of heroic and immortal Chinese workers and peasants who sacrificed their lives on the battlefields and in the cities and villages of this great nation in the struggle for freedom. Their sacrifice has won a new and happy life for the people they loved, enabling them to build socialism in peace. This is a major contribution to the peace and happiness of all mankind.

	We respect the glorious Communist Party of China; it has led the people in decades of heroic struggle—through the difficult years of Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement and suppression, in the Long March, in the continuous struggle against the Japanese aggressors, and now in the wonderful era of the Great Leap Forward. Even in the short time we have been in Beijing, we have been deeply moved to see how enthusiastically and quickly the people are eliminating the vestiges of the old era and proudly building a new China. This reality powerfully refutes the foolish and malicious slander spread by Western newspapers that Chinese socialism has "failed."

	Over the years, Canadians with democratic ideas have sympathized with and supported the great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. In the 1930s, tens of thousands of Canadians participated in the boycott of Japanese goods, opposing the shipment of Canadian scrap iron to Japanese arms manufacturers. Many linked these anti-fascist actions to supporting the Spanish Republic against Franco, Hitler, and Mussolini. The life of the great Canadian Communist Dr. Bethune embodies this consistency of democratic goals. Dr. Bethune dedicated himself to serving both his own country and yours, and next month marks the twentieth anniversary of his death.

	Today, there is widespread demand throughout Canada for recognition of the People's Republic of China and the development of trade with the People's Republic of China. This demand comes not only from leftists, but also from the entire labor movement, agricultural groups, and some influential bourgeois figures. The Canadian government still succumbs to the dictates of the State Department in Washington, voting against allowing the legitimate representatives of 650 million Chinese people to take their seats in the United Nations. This situation is causing increasing resentment in our country.

	Our party will hold its Seventh Congress in Toronto on October 9. At the congress, we will plan how to intensify our propaganda campaign to mobilize an ever-wider range of the Canadian people to fight for peace, for freeing our country from political, economic, and military subordination to U.S. imperialism, and for socialism. A crucial part of our struggle will be to continue efforts to get Canada to recognize the People's Republic of China and to eliminate the confusion spread in our country by U.S. imperialist lackeys who deceive the people by claiming that there are "two Chinas" and dreaming of reviving the rotten corpse of the Chiang Kai-shek clique that is still defiling Taiwan.

	Khrushchev's visit to the United States, a brilliant example of the Soviet Union's peace initiatives, has had a profound impact on the Canadian people and has made all our struggles for peace less difficult than before.

	After our Canadian delegation, Comrades Beechin and Caron and I, return home, we will report to Canadians on the grand celebration of this tenth anniversary, which fully demonstrates the creative labor of the entire Chinese people bearing fruit in the cause of building socialism. We will bring the message of peace and friendship from the Chinese people to the world. We assure you that our party will make unremitting efforts to develop mutually beneficial trade and friendly exchanges of knowledge and culture between our two countries (in this regard, we have much to learn from you).

	Although we Canadians live in one of the few remaining strongholds of imperialism in the world, the great ideas of socialism are beginning to attract the hearts of the Canadian people, because the truth of this idea has been so brilliantly demonstrated in the Soviet Union, People's China, and all other socialist countries. We confidently look forward to the day when our country will join all mankind on the path to socialism and lasting peace.

	Long live the great People's Republic of China and its glorious Communist Party!

	Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Canadian people!

	Long live world peace! (Includes picture)

    加拿大劳工进步党全国执行委员会委员、加拿大劳工进步党代表团团长
    纳尔逊·克拉克同志的贺词亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们在这个庆祝你们解放十周年的具有历史意义的时刻，带来了加拿大的共产主义政党劳工进步党对中国人民的最热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    你们对帝国主义、封建地主和四大家族的联合力量的胜利是全世界的全体工人的胜利。以美帝国主义为首的反动派和战争制造者受到了一次沉重的打击，他们永远无法从这种打击中恢复过来。
    我们同大家一起庄严地悼念千千万万英勇的永垂不朽的中国工人和农民，他们在争取自由的斗争中在战场上和这个伟大国家的各个城市和乡村中献出了自己的生命。他们的牺牲为他们热爱的人民赢得了新的幸福生活，使他们能够在和平中建设社会主义。这是对全人类的和平和幸福的重大贡献。
    我们尊敬的光荣的中国共产党；它领导人民进行了几十年的英勇斗争——在蒋介石围剿的艰苦岁月中，在长征中，在对日本侵略者进行的不断的斗争中，在目前的大跃进的美好年代中，它始终领导人民进行英勇的斗争。甚至在我们呆在北京的短短几天中，我们都深受感动，我们看到了人民是多么热情地、迅速地在消灭旧时代的遗迹，自豪地建设新中国。这一现实十分有力地驳斥了西方报纸散布的中国社会主义“遭到失败”的愚蠢而恶毒的谰言。
    这些年来，具有民主思想的加拿大人一直同情和支持中国人民的伟大的革命斗争。在二十世纪三十年代，成千成万的加拿大人参加了抵制日货运动，反对把加拿大废铁运给日本军火制造商。许多人把这些反法西斯的行动同支持当时的西班牙共和国反对佛朗哥、希特勒和墨索里尼的斗争联系起来。伟大的加拿大共产党员白求恩大夫的一生就体现了这种民主目标的一致性，白求恩大夫曾经鞠躬尽瘁地为他自己的国家和你们国家服务，下一个月正好是他逝世二十周年。
    今天，加拿大全国普遍要求承认中华人民共和国和发展同中华人民共和国的贸易。提出这个要求的不仅有左翼人士，而且有整个工会运动、农业团体和一些有影响的资产阶级人士。加拿大政府仍然屈从华盛顿国务院的命令，投票反对让六亿五千万中国人民的合法代表在联合国中取得席位，这种情况在我们国内引起了愈来愈大的愤慨。
    我们党将在10月9日在多伦多召开第七次代表大会。我们在会上将计划如何加紧进行宣传运动，使加拿大人民中有越来越广泛的阶层起来争取和平，争取使我国摆脱在政治、经济和军事上屈从美帝国主义的状态，争取社会主义。我们斗争的一个十分重要的部分将是继续努力使加拿大承认中华人民共和国和消除美帝国主义的走狗在我国散布的混乱，这些走狗欺骗人民，硬说目前存在“两个中国”，妄想叫仍然在玷污台湾的蒋介石集团的腐烂僵尸复活。
    赫鲁晓夫的访问美国，是苏联的和平的首创精神的光辉范例，这一访问已对加拿大人民发生了深刻的影响，并也使我们一切为和平所作的斗争比前减少困难。
    我们加拿大代表团，比钦同志、卡隆同志和我回国以后将向加拿大人报告这个盛大的十周年庆祝典礼的盛况，这种盛况充分表明，中国全体人民的创造性劳动在建设社会主义的事业中开花结果了。我们将把中国人民的和平和友谊的信息带给全世界。我们保证我们的党将进行不懈的努力，以开展互利的贸易，发展我们两国之间的知识和文化的友好交流（在这方面，我们要向你们学习的东西很多）。
    虽然我们加拿大人生活在这个世界上几个残存的帝国主义据点之一，但是社会主义的伟大思想也正在开始吸引加拿大人民的心，因为这种思想的真理在苏联、人民中国以及其他所有社会主义国家里已经得到如此辉煌的表现。我们满怀信心地期待着我国同全人类一起走上社会主义和持久和平的大道的日子。
    伟大的中华人民共和国及其光荣的共产党万岁！
    中加人民的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
