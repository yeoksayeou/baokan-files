Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 14th: According to Indian newspapers, Indian Defense Minister Menon, speaking at a public gathering in Bombay on the 10th, said regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, "We hope to reach a friendly agreement with China, but you cannot establish friendship by abandoning your legitimate rights."

He said that "our territory has been invaded. We will do our utmost to defend our borders." He also said that he hoped "the great leaders and people of China will respond to India's friendly feelings towards them and take steps to restore the situation that existed on the Sino-Indian border before the recent events."

He said that for four thousand years, there had been no conflict on the border between India and China, one of the largest countries in the world. "Why should there be conflict in this generation?" He said, "Our border is a border established by habit and convention over a long period. However, we are not saying that minor adjustments should not be made where necessary." He also said that unresolved border issues cannot be solved by drawing maps or imagining border lines, and even on already demarcated borders, there may be disputes, but they cannot be resolved by unilateral action.

He said that India should formulate policies to resolve disputes with other countries, so that "we will not be misled by some parties who are trying to use this situation to push our country from its position of non-alignment into the Cold War."

According to the "Hindustan Times," Menon also said at the meeting, "You can rest assured that the Minister of Defense is not undermining the defense of this country."

Recently, some leaders of the right-wing Indian political parties, the Praja Socialist Party and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, have fiercely attacked Menon inside and outside Parliament, saying that he has "remained silent" on the issue of the so-called "Chinese aggression against Tibet." They have also demanded Menon's resignation.

    梅农竟说印度领土受侵犯
    又说希望同中国达成友好的协议
    并主张不应被一些党派引上歧途
    新华社新德里14日电　据印度报纸报道，印度国防部长梅农10日在孟买的一个公众集会上谈到中印边界问题时说，“我们希望同中国达成友好的协议，但是你不能用放弃你的合法权利的办法来建立友谊。”
    他说什么“我们的领土受到了侵犯。我们将尽我们最大的力量来保卫我们的边境。”他又说，他希望“中国的伟大领导人和人民会回答印度对他们的友好感情，采取步骤恢复在最近事件发生以前在中印边界上存在的状况。”
    他说，四千年来，在印度同世界最大国之一中国在边界上没有发生过任何冲突，“这一代为什么要发生冲突呢？”他说，“我们的边界是由习惯和惯例在很长时期内确立下来的边界。可是，我们并不是说，在有必要的地方不应该作次要的调整。”他又说，未定界问题是不能用画地图或想像的边界线的办法来解决的，即使在已经划定的边界上，也可能有争端，可是不能以单方面的行动来加以解决。
    他说，印度应该制订政策，解决同其他国家的争端，这样，“我们就不会被一些党派引上歧途，这些党派试图利用这个局势来把我们国家从它的不结盟的立场推入冷战。”
    据“印度斯坦时报”报道，梅农在会上还说，“你们尽可以放心，国防部长并没有在破坏这个国家的国防。”
    最近，印度右翼政党人民社会党和印度人民同盟的一些领导人在议会内外猛烈攻击梅农，说他在所谓“中国侵略西藏”的问题上“保持沉默”。他们还要求梅农辞职。
