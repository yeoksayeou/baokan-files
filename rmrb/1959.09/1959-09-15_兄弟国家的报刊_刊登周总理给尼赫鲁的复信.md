Xinhua News Agency, September 14th -- Major newspapers in the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries published Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on September 8 regarding the Sino-Indian border issue between September 10th and 12th.

The Soviet "Pravda," "Trud," "Izvestia," "Soviet Russia," "Red Star," and "Soviet Navy" all published excerpts of Premier Zhou's letter on the third or fourth page on September 12th, taking up about one-third of the page. At the same time, they also published excerpts of the Indian government's letter to the Chinese government dated March 22nd.

The headlines of "Pravda," "Trud," "Red Star," and "Soviet Navy" were: "Letter from Premier Zhou Enlai to Indian Prime Minister Nehru," "Letter from the Indian Government to the People's Republic of China."

The large headline of "Izvestia" was "Eliminating Tension," with the smaller headline "Zhou Enlai's Letter to Nehru." The headline of "Soviet Russia" was "Conflicts Can Be Resolved Peacefully," with the smaller headline "The Main Thing is to Maintain Friendship."

Newspapers in the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea all published excerpts of Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Prime Minister Nehru on September 11th.

The headline of "Rodong Sinmun" was "Regarding the Sino-Indian Border Issue," with the sub-title: "Premier Zhou Enlai's Reply to Prime Minister Nehru."

A commentary published in the Korean "Democratic Youth" on September 12th regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of reply to Nehru on September 8th pointed out that the Indian army had illegally crossed the so-called McMahon Line, launched armed attacks on Chinese border troops, and harbored armed Tibetan rebels in the areas they forcibly occupied. This was an infringement on China's sovereignty and territory, and a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. It said that the Sino-Indian border issue must be resolved quickly to eliminate the gap exploited by the common enemy of the Asian people—the American imperialists—to infringe upon peace and the interests of the Asian people.

The commentary said that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of reply to Nehru regarding the Sino-Indian border issue clearly demonstrated the consistent peace-loving foreign policy of the People's Republic of China in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Indian border issue. It was warmly welcomed by all peace-loving people in the Far East and around the world. The Korean people and youth fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's letter and believe that it is the most just way to resolve the border issue based on the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples and in the interests of both peoples. We sincerely hope that the Sino-Indian border issue can be resolved through peaceful means and friendly consultations between the two sides, based on the traditional spirit of friendship forged between the peoples of China and India.

"Pyongyang News" published a commentary on September 11th, warmly supporting the position expressed in Premier Zhou Enlai's letter of reply to Nehru regarding the resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue.

The editorial board added the following note before the letter: "Recently, news agencies, newspapers, and radio stations in imperialist and capitalist countries have been wantonly slandering China for creating tensions in the Sino-Indian border situation and infringing upon Indian territory. On September 7th, Indian Prime Minister Nehru announced in the Indian Parliament the letter he wrote to Premier Zhou Enlai on March 22nd.
