Pingxiang Overcomes Major Insect Plague Unseen in Fifty Years
Late Rice Growing Well, May Exceed Early Rice

(Our Dispatch) The 400,000 people of Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, fought hard for sixty days, overcoming the most serious insect plague in nearly fifty years, laying a good foundation for the county's overproduction movement.

Last year, in September and October, the temperature was high in this county, and there was little frost and snow last winter and this spring. This natural condition facilitated the breeding and growth of pests. This year's insect damage was more extensive, denser, and more varied than in any previous year. The scope of the insect damage affected more than half of the county's late rice crop.

The Pingxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principles of "treating early, treating well, and treating thoroughly" and "prevention is more important than cure," quickly adopted organizational measures. They established insect situation forecasting stations, organized commercial and handicraft departments to purchase insecticides from other places, rushed to manufacture various pesticide tools, and quickly organized an army of 400,000 people to exterminate insects and threw them into battle. In addition, pest control joint defense organizations were established to coordinate encirclement and annihilation. The commune members of each commune participated in the fight to eliminate pests in a combat-ready posture. They changed the natural environment conducive to the spread of pests by methods such as removing the soil from the dikes and burning weeds. At the same time, they sprayed preventive pesticides on the seedlings, removed weeds connected to the pest-infested fields, and protected the fields. During the day, manual beating was used, and at night, lamps were used to lure and kill the insects. In the sixty days of the pest control struggle, the county sprayed a total of more than 5 million jin of various insecticides, an average of ten jin per mu. 500,000 torches and oil lamps were lit, an average of one per mu of field, which revived the growth of 20,000 mu of late rice affected by rice borers. In addition, more than 200,000 mu of late rice that had not been affected by pests were also sprayed with pesticides three times to prevent insect damage. Although half of the county's late rice crop was affected by insect pests this year, it is estimated that the yield can still exceed that of the early rice crop.

The principle of economy was implemented throughout the insect control struggle. Experienced old farmers were mobilized to offer suggestions, and local methods of pest control were summarized and applied. Many communes organized pharmacies and elderly people who could identify medicinal herbs to collect dozens of kinds of medicinal herbs from the mountains and made more than 3.9 million jin of local pesticides. Various communes also made a large number of bamboo tube water guns to replace sprayers. The county saved more than 1.2 million yuan in pesticides and pesticide machinery alone.

The important reason why Pingxiang County was able to overcome the serious insect damage this year was that the county party committee, commune party committees, and brigade branches all had secretaries in command, going deep into the fields to direct operations. By exhibiting various insect pest specimens, organizing the masses to visit the sites of serious insect damage, calculating the breeding efficiency of insects, etc., the cadres' and masses' understanding of insect damage was enhanced, and their confidence in the inevitable victory over insects was strengthened. Because the scope of the people's communes is large, it is convenient for teams and communes to deploy, act, and fight together in a unified manner. It is conducive to mobilizing all manpower and material resources within the scope of the entire commune. For example, at the beginning of the insect control, the commercial, handicraft, and cultural and educational departments of each commune were put into the insect control struggle under the unified leadership of the commune. The commercial department organized nearly a thousand people to participate in insect control, and also sent a large number of people to various counties to collect more than 900,000 jin of chemical pesticides to meet the needs of insect control. Many school students and teachers also automatically organized themselves to participate in this insect control work. The handicraft department rushed to manufacture a large number of pesticide tools to support agricultural production, ensuring the victory of the insect control struggle. (Attached picture)

    萍乡战胜五十年来大虫灾
    晚稻生长良好可以超过早稻
    本报讯　江西萍乡县四十万群众苦战六十天，战胜了近五十年来最严重的虫灾，为全县的超产运动奠定了良好的基础。
    这个县去年9、10月间气温高，去冬今春霜雪少，这种自然状况便利了害虫的繁殖和生长。今年的虫害比已往任何一年都面积广、密度大、种类多，虫害危及的范围占全县晚稻一半以上。
    中共萍乡县委根据“治早、治好、治了”和“防重于治”的原则，火速地采取了组织措施。建立虫情预报站，组织商业、手工业部门到外地采购灭虫药剂，赶制各种药械工具，很快地组织起了四十万人的灭虫大军，投入了战斗。此外，还建立了灭虫联防机构，以便协同围歼。各个公社的社员们以战斗的姿态，参加了捕灭虫害的斗争。他们用铲光田埂和烧掉杂草等办法，改变了有利虫害蔓延的自然环境。同时，给禾苗打预防药水，铲除与虫害田相连接的杂草，保护好田。白天用人工扑打，夜晚用灯火诱杀。六十天的灭虫斗争，全县共洒各种杀虫药水五百多万斤，平均每亩达到十斤。点燃火把、油灯五十万处，平均每亩田一处，使二万亩被螟虫危害的晚稻复活生长，另外二十多万亩未遭虫害的晚稻也全部打过三次预防农药，防止了虫害。今年全县虽有半数晚稻发生虫害，但估计产量仍然可以超过早稻。
    除虫斗争自始至终地贯彻了节约的原则，发动了有经验的老农献计，并总结与运用了土法灭虫经验。许多公社组织药店和能识别药草的老人，上山采集了几十种药草，制成了三百九十多万斤土农药。各个公社还制出了大批竹筒水枪，代替了喷雾器。全县单农药和农药机械两项就节省了一百二十多万元。
    今年萍乡县能够战胜严重的虫害，重要原因是县委、公社党委、大队支部都做到了书记挂帅，深入田间指挥作战。通过展览各种虫害标本，组织群众到虫害严重的现场去参观，计算虫子繁殖效率等等，提高了干部和群众对虫害的认识，坚定了灭虫必胜的信心。由于人民公社范围大，便于队与队社与社统一部署，统一行动，协同作战。有利于在全社范围内调动一切人力、物力。如在灭虫开始时，各公社的商业、手工业和文教部门在公社的统一领导下投入了灭虫斗争。商业部门组织了近千人参加灭虫，还派了大批人员到各县采集了九十多万斤化学农药，满足了灭虫所需的药剂。许多学校的学生和教师也都自动组织起来，参加了这次灭虫工作。手工业部门为支援农业生产，赶制出大批灭虫药械，保证了灭虫斗争的胜利。（附图片）
