Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 26th: Construction of the LengHu No. 5 Oilfield in the Qaidam Basin is being accelerated. The first phase of the LengHu Refinery, with an annual refining capacity of 300,000 tons of crude oil, was completed in just over two months and has already started refining oil. Projects such as the duplicate water pipeline, oil selection station, and oil gathering station have also been partially completed. In addition, office buildings, dormitories, hospitals, auditoriums, and other buildings with a total area of more than 40,000 square meters have been constructed. All kinds of buildings are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain on the Gobi Desert.

Upon completion of all these capital construction projects this year, they will provide the state with hundreds of thousands of tons of crude oil and fuels such as gasoline and kerosene.

Construction workers have worked hard to overcome various difficulties during construction, enabling these projects to be built not only quickly but also with good quality. The quality of the refinery's cooling pool and pump room, among other projects, has met the design requirements. Detailed inspections were carried out on concealed works during the construction process, and the water pipelines were buried three meters underground to prevent freezing.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 26th: The LengHu No. 5 Oilfield in Qaidam is rapidly expanding through simultaneous exploration, production, and construction. The expanded oilfield area is almost twice as large as it was when construction began this year.

In the past month or so, many medium-deep and deep exploration wells have continuously reported good news of oil gushing and flowing. These exploration wells erupting with oil one after another have continuously extended the oil-bearing zone of the LengHu No. 5 Oilfield outwards. In terms of depth, people compare the oil reservoir of LengHu No. 5 to a multi-story building, and currently, mining is mainly carried out only on the "upper floors" above 500-600 meters.

Extensive areas adjacent to the LengHu No. 5 structure, including the No. 3, No. 4, No. 6, and Latent No. 1 and No. 2 structures, have been recently confirmed by drilling to have good oil and gas shows in the middle of the Jurassic and Tertiary strata. This further proves that LengHu is a large oil-rich area.

The LengHu No. 5 Oilfield has the advantages of being close to transportation lines, having shallow wells, and being self-spraying, making it easy to develop. A relatively small investment can yield a large amount of crude oil. In particular, the oil quality is good, generally containing more than 40% gasoline. One ton of crude oil here is equivalent to 1.6 tons from Yumen and Karamay. (Attached picture)

### 冷湖五号油田加速建设  冷湖炼油厂开始炼油

    冷湖五号油田加速建设
    冷湖炼油厂开始炼油
    新华社西宁26日电　柴达木盆地上冷湖五号油田的建设正在加速进行。年炼三十万吨原油的冷湖炼油厂第一期工程只用两个多月的时间就已建成，并已开始炼油。输水管线复线、选油站和集油站等工程，也已部分完工。此外，还建设了总面积为四万多平方米的办公室、宿舍、医院、礼堂等房屋建筑。各种式样的建筑，正像雨后春笋般出现在戈壁滩上。
    今年这些基本建设项目全部完成，将为国家提供数十万吨原油和汽油、煤油等燃料。
    建设工人们努力克服施工中各种困难，使这些工程的建设不仅速度较快，而且质量较好。炼油厂的冷却池和泵房等工程的质量，都达到了设计要求。对隐蔽工程，在施工过程中作了详细检查，输水管线都掩埋在三米深的地下，以免受冻。
    新华社西宁26日电　柴达木冷湖五号油田在边勘探、边生产、边建设中迅速扩大。扩大的油田面积比今年开始建设时的面积增加了将近两倍。
    最近一个多月来，许多中深探井和深探井不断传来喷油和流油的喜讯。这些探井接二连三地喷油，使冷湖五号油田储油带不断向外延伸。在纵深方面，人们把冷湖五号油藏比作是楼房式的壳层，现在主要还只在五、六百米以上的“楼上”开采。
    邻近冷湖五号构造的三号、四号、六号和潜伏一号、二号构造的广大地区，经最近钻探证实，在侏儸纪及第三纪地层中部都得到了良好的油气显示。这都进一步证明冷湖是一个面积大、储油丰富的油区。
    冷湖五号油田具有距交通线近、井浅、又系自喷等优点，易于开发，用较少的投资就可以获得较多的原油。特别是油的质量好，一般含汽油40％以上。这里一吨原油相当于玉门、克拉玛依的一点六吨。（附图片）
