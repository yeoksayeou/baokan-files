Protecting Cultural Relics
	Xie Chensheng

	We are a country with a long history. In the long, arduous, and glorious struggles for production and class struggle, our ancestors created an incomparably brilliant and rich historical and cultural heritage for us. The material cultural heritage preserved above and below ground is an important part of the motherland's cultural heritage. They embody the genius and labor of our ancestors through the ages; they reflect all aspects of social life throughout the ages. Therefore, doing a good job in protecting and managing them is of great significance for studying the history of the motherland, enhancing the national self-esteem of the broad masses of people, and creating a socialist and national new culture.

	The Party and the government have always attached great importance to the protection of cultural relics. After the founding of the country, they have made a series of regulations on paying attention to the protection of cultural relics in production and construction, and clearly pointed out that this is currently one of the important common tasks of the cultural departments and basic construction departments. Great achievements have been made in the past few years. However, there have also been cases of damage to cultural relics in individual places. The main reasons for this situation are, on the one hand, the socialist construction of the motherland is developing by leaps and bounds, and the construction projects in various places are very extensive and rapid, but the strength of the cultural relics work force is very weak, and therefore cannot adapt to the needs of the development of the objective situation; on the other hand, the publicity work for the state's policy of protecting cultural relics is not universal and in-depth enough, so some departments or the masses do not know what cultural relics are, nor do they understand the significance of protecting cultural relics, and thus unintentionally damage them.

	It should be clear that all production and construction projects are the basic links in the country's socialist construction. Therefore, the protection of cultural relics must be carried out under the two-benefit principle of not hindering production and construction and ensuring that cultural relics are properly protected. We must oppose the rude attitude of neglecting the cultural heritage of the motherland, and also prevent one-sided emphasis on the protection of cultural relics and affecting production and construction. In order to resolve the contradiction between subjective strength and objective needs, we can adopt the method of combining professional teams with the masses, and while strengthening the training of cultural relics professionals, vigorously popularize cultural relics knowledge and widely carry out publicity activities for the state's policy of protecting cultural relics. As long as the masses understand the important significance of protecting cultural relics, they will combine the protection of cultural relics with the broad masses' enthusiasm for loving the motherland, thereby becoming a conscious and active action. In addition, strengthening the connection between cultural departments and construction departments is also very important. Of course, coordinating the work of cultural relics protection in national construction projects is an important task of cultural departments at all levels, but protecting the cultural heritage of the motherland is the responsibility of all the people. Therefore, all construction departments must also take on this responsibility and cooperate with the cultural departments to jointly protect cultural relics.

    保护文物
    谢辰生
    我们是一个具有悠久历史的国家，我们祖先在长期的艰苦而光辉的生产斗争和阶级斗争中，为我们创造出无比灿烂丰富的历史文化遗产。被保存在地上地下的物质文化遗产，是祖国文化遗产的一个重要部分。它们凝结着我们历代祖先的天才智慧和劳动；反映了历代社会生活的各个方面。因此，做好对它们的保护和管理工作，对于研究祖国历史，提高广大人民群众民族自尊心和创造社会主义的、民族的新文化都具有重大的意义。
    党和政府一向十分重视文物保护工作，建国后曾经作了一系列关于在生产建设中注意保护文物的规定，并且明确指出这是目前文化部门和基本建设部门的共同的重要任务之一。几年来，已经取得了很大成绩。但是也还有个别地方发生了破坏文物的情况。产生这种情况的主要原因是，一方面祖国社会主义建设正一日千里地飞跃发展，各地的建设工程是十分广泛而迅速的，但是文物工作队伍的力量非常薄弱，因而不能适应客观形势发展的需要；另一方面是对于国家保护文物政策的宣传工作，作得不够普遍深入，所以有的部门或群众因为不知道什么是文物，也不了解保护文物的意义，以致在无意中破坏了文物。
    应该明确，各项生产建设工程是国家社会主义建设的基本环节。所以，保护文物工作必须在既不妨碍生产建设，又要使文物得到妥善保护的两利原则下进行。我们既要反对轻视祖国文化遗产的粗暴态度，也要防止片面强调保护文物而影响生产建设。为了解决主观力量和客观需要之间的矛盾，可以采取专业队伍与群众相结合的办法，在加强培养文物专业人员的同时，大力普及文物知识，广泛开展国家保护文物政策的宣传活动。只要群众明白了保护文物的重要意义，就会使保护文物工作和广大群众热爱祖国的热情结合起来，从而成为自觉的积极行动。此外，加强文化部门与建设部门之间的联系，也是非常重要的。固然配合国家建设工程的文物保护工作是各级文化部门的一项重要工作，但是保护祖国文化遗产却是全民的责任。因此，各建设部门也必须负起这个责任与文化部门通力合作，共同保护文物。
