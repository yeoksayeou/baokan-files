Xinhua News Agency, September 12th, London dispatch: The British "Tribune" weekly published an article on the 4th, admitting that "the McMahon Line has no basis in international law."

The "Tribune" weekly said that British official McMahon drew this northern border line of India in 1914. The weekly acknowledged that, under duress, the then "Tibetan authorities agreed to the McMahon Line" "because British troops had cruelly invaded" Tibet "ten years before (this event)," "they had no freedom of choice."

The article continued that McMahon "in order to make this agreement an international treaty," attempted to make China "sign another treaty recognizing the independence of Tibet" (referring to the Simla Treaty). The then Chinese central government "immediately denied this treaty as soon as it received this information. So the McMahon Line has no basis in international law." However, the "Tribune" weekly's article disregarded the fact that the McMahon Line illegally deprived China of large areas of territory, and defended the aggression of British imperialism, stubbornly claiming that the McMahon Line "is not a bad border line" and "does not embody any new annexation." The article also slandered that "the Chinese Communists have always been evil and aggressive," and that China is currently "resorting to violence" on the Sino-Indian border issue.

    英“论坛”周报承认
    麦克马洪线在国际法上没有根据
    诬蔑中国在中印边界问题上“诉诸暴力”
    新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：英国“论坛”周报4日发表一篇文章，承认“麦克马洪线在国际法上是没有根据的”。
    “论坛”周报说，英国官员麦克马洪在1914年划出了这条印度北部的边界线。这家周报承认，在被迫的情况下，当时的“西藏当局同意了麦克马洪线”，“因为英国军队在（这个事件的）十年以前残酷地侵入了”西藏，“他们没有任何选择的自由。”
    文章接着写道，麦克马洪“为了使这个协议成为一项国际条约”，曾经企图使中国“签订另一个承认给予西藏独立的条约”（按指西姆拉条约）。当时的中国中央政府“一得到这个消息就立即否认了这个条约。所以麦克马洪线在国际法上是没有根据的。”但是“论坛”周报的文章却又不顾麦克马洪线非法划去了中国大片领土的事实，为英帝国主义的侵略辩护，它硬说麦克马洪线“不是一条坏的边界线”，“并不体现任何新的吞并”。文章里还诬蔑什么“中国共产党人一向是恶邪而好侵略的”，中国目前在中印边界问题上“诉诸暴力”。
