    "Pravda" Editorial Points Out:
    Soviet Lunar Rocket is a Great Victory for the New World
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th - TASS reported from Moscow: Today, the Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial titled "Success!" which pointed out that the Soviet cosmic rocket's victorious arrival at the moon is a remarkable achievement of Soviet science and technology, opening a new chapter in the study of cosmic space.
    The editorial said that today, the whole world is talking about the first cosmic flight in history to reach another celestial body from Earth. People all over the world, the entire progressive mankind, are enthusiastically celebrating this brilliant victory of the Soviet Union – a victory of world significance.
    The editorial pointed out that the world-historically significant achievement of Soviet science and technology marks the arrival of a new century – a century of conquering cosmic space, which mankind has dreamed of for generations. On October 4, 1957, the world's first artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union flew into the mysterious and distant universe. Subsequently, just one month later, the second satellite went into space. And on May 15, 1958, the third launched by the Soviet Union also went into space. The satellite has already orbited the Earth six thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight times and is continuing to operate at high speed.
    January 2, 1959, was a new and significant day for the study of the universe. On this day, the Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket to the moon, overcoming the Earth's gravity and becoming the first artificial planet to orbit the sun.
    Comrade Khrushchev, at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, called this victory of the Soviet Union a new achievement of worldwide significance, a momentous event in the era of building communism.
    The editorial said the second Soviet cosmic rocket consolidated our country's leading role in important sectors of science and technology and in mastering the mysteries of the universe, and brilliantly proved the continuous development of Soviet rocket science.
    The editorial pointed out that the unprecedented achievements of the Soviet Union in all fields of human activity are not accidental. These achievements demonstrate the indisputable superiority of the socialist system and its tremendous achievements in the development of economy, science, and culture. Only socialism can open up a vast space for the vigorous development of productive forces and for the unleashing of the genius of hundreds of millions of people. The launching of the second Soviet cosmic rocket is an outstanding event of our time, which has aroused a new wave of labor enthusiasm among the working people of our country and a strong desire to add glory to the motherland with better work.
    The editorial continued that the achievements of the Soviet state and its advanced science gladden all progressive mankind. The people of the socialist camp celebrate this great event in the history of the Earth as if celebrating their own festival. They rightly regard this victory as a great victory for the new world, as a victory for the lofty ideals of socialism and communism. This victory inspires people of all countries to strive for new achievements. The abundant experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Europe and Asia convinces the people of the world that communism will bring happiness to mankind and realize mankind's most cherished ideals and boldest hopes.
    The editorial said that now, as our country enters the period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of communism, every day will bring ever-changing achievements. Simultaneously with the launching of the second cosmic rocket, the world's first atomic icebreaker has been launched, which is of extremely great significance.
    All this shows the peace-loving aspirations of the people of our country under the leadership of the Communist Party and the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet state.
    The editorial continued that while congratulating the Soviet Union on its new and significant victory, international public opinion also emphasized the great significance of the upcoming visit of Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the United States. The meeting between the heads of government of the two most powerful countries may have a positive impact on easing international tensions and on strengthening peace and cooperation among the people of all countries. All the Soviet people and peace-loving people all over the world warmly hope that the head of the Soviet government, Khrushchev, will achieve success in his noble mission.

    “真理报”发表社论指出
    苏联月球火箭是新世界的伟大胜利
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”今天在一篇题为“成功了！”的社论中指出，苏联宇宙火箭胜利地到达月球，是苏联科学技术的卓越成就，它为研究宇宙空间揭开了新的一页。
    社论说，今天，全世界都在谈论着历史上第一次实现的从地球到达另一个天体的宇宙飞行。全世界的人们，整个进步人类都热烈欢呼苏联的这一辉煌胜利——具有世界意义的胜利。
    社论指出，苏联科学和技术的具有世界历史意义的成就标志着一个新世纪——人类世世代代所憧憬的、征服宇宙空间的世纪的来临。1957年10月4日，苏联发射的世界上第一个人造地球卫星飞入了玄妙的遥远的宇宙。随后，刚刚过了一个月，第二个卫星又上天了。而1958年5月15日苏联发射的第三个也上了天，卫星已经绕地球转了六千八百八十八圈，并且正在继续飞速地运行。
    1959年1月2日是研究宇宙的新的有重大意义的日子。在这一天，苏联向月球发射的宇宙火箭克服了地心吸力，成了第一个围绕太阳飞行的人造行星。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上把苏联这个胜利称为具有全世界意义的新功绩，称为建立起共产主义的时期的惊天动地的事件。
    社论说苏联第二个宇宙火箭巩固了我国在科学和技术重要部门和在掌握宇宙的奥秘方面的主导作用，光辉地证明苏联火箭飞行科学在不断发展。
    社论指出，苏联在人类活动的各个领域中取得空前的成就并不是偶然的。这些成就表明社会主义制度无可争辩的优越性和在发展经济、科学和文化方面的巨大成就。只有社会主义才能为生产力的蓬勃发展，为亿万人的天才的发挥开辟广阔的天地。第二个苏联宇宙火箭的上天是我们时代杰出的事件，这引起了我国劳动人民新的劳动高潮，引起了他们要以更好的工作来为祖国增光的强烈愿望。
    社论接着说，苏维埃国家及其先进科学的成就使所有进步人类欢欣鼓舞。社会主义阵营各国人民就像庆祝自己的节日一样来庆祝地球历史上的这一伟大事件。他们正确地把这一胜利看作是新世界的伟大胜利，看作是社会主义和共产主义崇高理想的胜利。这一胜利鼓舞着各国人民争取新的成就。苏联及欧洲和亚洲社会主义各国的极丰富的经验使世界各国人民深信，共产主义会给人类带来幸福，实现人类最憧憬的理想和最勇敢的希望。
    社论说，现在，当我国进入了全面展开共产主义建设的时期的时候，每一天都将带来日新月异的成就。在发射第二个宇宙火箭的同时，世界上第一艘原子破冰船已经下水，这是具有极其重大意义的。
    所有这一切都表明了在共产党领导下的我国人民爱好和平的愿望和苏维埃国家和平的外交政策。
    社论接着说，国际舆论在祝贺苏联新的具有重大意义的胜利的同时，还着重指出了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫即将到美国访问的巨大意义。两个最强大的国家的政府首脑的会晤，可能对缓和国际紧张局势、对巩固和平和各国人民之间的合作产生良好的影响。全苏联人民、世界各国拥护和平的人都热烈地希望苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫在他崇高的使命中取得成就。
