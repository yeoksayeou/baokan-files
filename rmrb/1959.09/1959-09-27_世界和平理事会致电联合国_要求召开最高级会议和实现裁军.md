Xinhua News Agency, London, 25th. TASS reports: The headquarters of the Executive Chairman of the World Peace Council released a telegram sent to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

The first part of the telegram is a call for a top-level meeting.

The call points out that the mutual visits of the leaders of the Soviet and American governments mark a potential change in the global Cold War situation. Various groups and movements working to defend world peace have demanded such changes and have done their utmost to help achieve them. Governments should respond to the desires of people in all countries who are weary of the Cold War.

The call says that the problems still to be solved are complex. The atmosphere of distrust that is poisoning peace has not yet been eliminated. There is still a force opposing the elimination of tension. To ensure the best opportunity for talks and exchanges of views, a top-level meeting should be convened immediately.

Public opinion has brought national leaders together. It is the power of public opinion that can push them all the way to reach an agreement. If each of us, individually or within our organizations, redoubles our efforts and works together, we can promote an early meeting and the conclusion of agreements.

Making war impossible is no longer a fantasy, but a responsibility facing every government. Making war impossible is a matter for the people of all countries, who today have the power to do so.

The second part of the telegram is a letter from the Presidium of the World Peace Council to the United Nations General Assembly.

The letter points out that the Soviet Union's proposal for comprehensive and complete disarmament under supervision, the many plans put forward by the British government and other countries' governments, the agreement reached between the four major powers on the establishment of a disarmament commission on an equal basis, and many other important measures aimed at easing international tensions – all of these prove that there has been a major development in the international political situation. The letter says that public opinion is paying increasing attention to the activities of the United Nations. Public opinion hopes that this session will adopt concrete measures to end the Cold War and begin disarmament.

    世界和平理事会致电联合国
    要求召开最高级会议和实现裁军
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社伦敦25日讯：世界和平理事会执行主席总部发表了拍给联合国大会主席和联合国秘书长的一封电报。
    电报的前一部分是关于召开最高级会议的呼吁书。
    呼吁书指出，苏、美两国政府首脑互相访问，标志着世界冷战局势有可能改变。为保卫世界和平而工作的各种团体和运动，曾经要求这样的变化，并且曾经竭尽全力协助争取这种变化。各国政府应该对厌恶冷战的各国人民的愿望有所反应。
    呼吁书说，但是，还待解决的问题是复杂的。正在毒化和平的那种不信任气氛还没有消除。还有一股力量在反对消除紧张局势。为了保证有最好的机会来进行会谈和交换意见，应该立即召开最高级会议。
    舆论使各国领导人聚集在一起。正是舆论的力量能够促使他们一直走到达成协议为止。如果我们每个人，不管是个别的，还是在我们组织中的，都加倍努力，共同奋斗，那么我们就可以促使早日召开会议和缔结协定。
    使战争成为不可能，这现在已不是幻想，而是每个政府面临的职责。使战争成为不可能，这是各国人民的事，今天他们已有可能做到这一点。
    电报的第二部分是世界和平理事会主席团写给联合国大会的信。
    信中指出，苏联提出的有监督的全面和彻底的裁军建议、英国政府和其他国家的政府提出的许多计划、四大国之间就在对等的基础上建立裁军委员会所达成的协议以及其他许多旨在缓和国际紧张局势的重大措施——这一切都证明国际政治局势有了重大发展。信中说，舆论越来越注意联合国的活动。舆论希望，这届会议将通过一些具体措施来结束冷战和开始裁军。
