    The Current Situation of Japanese Agriculture and the Struggle of Farmers

    岸信介's Reactionary Agricultural Policy
    While stepping up the revival of militarism, the Kishida Nobusuke government is further strengthening its reactionary agricultural policies through local autonomous organizations, "agricultural cooperatives" and other agricultural groups, and the "New Rural Construction Plan." At present, the feudal remnants left over from the incomplete "land reform" are still deeply rooted in Japanese rural areas. Even today, conservative reactionary forces still have a strong influence on the political and social life of the countryside.
    The old landlord forces, centered on the Liberal Democratic Party, organized the "Landlord Alliance" and demanded that the state compensate them for the land requisitioned during the "land reform." They want to strengthen their reactionary rule in the countryside through this organization and use the countryside as their base in elections. They are also secretly contacting the "National Farmers' Federation" to organize the "Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Village Political Alliance" to gather reactionary forces in the countryside. The core members of this "National Farmers' Federation" include former officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the "New Life Movement Association," and leaders of conservative agricultural technology groups. Now, the Ayukawa Yoshisuke gang has organized the "Rural Political Alliance," which is of the same nature as the "Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing Village Political Alliance."
    The Kishida Nobusuke government issued a "Draft Outline of Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries Policies" last year. From this "Outline," it can be seen that the Kishida Nobusuke government's reactionary agricultural policy is not aimed at the poor farmers who account for more than half of the farmers, but at supporting a part of the upper-level farmers, trying to maintain and strengthen the social pillar of the conservative forces in the countryside through this method. While increasing military spending and fiscal investment and loans for the service of U.S. imperialism and monopoly capital, the Kishida Nobusuke government has been cutting agricultural and forestry budgets related to farmers year by year. It also attempts to divide the unity of farmers politically in order to isolate the poor farmer class.
    "Low Grain Prices Hurt Farmers"
    The Kishida Nobusuke government uses the means of suppressing the purchase prices of agricultural products to force the farmer economy into an increasingly difficult situation. From rice and wheat to silkworm cocoons, dairy farmers' milk, fruits, and vegetables, prices have been suppressed below cost. The prices of agricultural products such as vegetables have often fluctuated over the years due to seasonal changes, but from the second half of 1957 to the present, vegetable prices have been falling. Moreover, in addition to occasional and special circumstances where high prices temporarily appear, price declines have spread to all agricultural products, becoming a common trend. Monopoly capitalists plunder most of the farmers' income by means of buying cheap and selling expensive. For example, they buy milk at a price of 4 yen per合(approximately 0.18 liters), but sell it for 15 yen.
    The prices of commercial agricultural products, such as silkworm cocoons, milk, chicken eggs, and vegetables such as radishes, have fallen particularly sharply. Taking 1951 as a base, by June of last year, the prices of these products had fallen by 9% to 33% respectively. As for the price of silkworm cocoons, the Japanese government unreasonably reduced it from 1,400 yen per 贯 (3.75 kilograms) to 1,000 yen. Conversely, the prices of agricultural supplies and household daily necessities purchased by farmers have only decreased by 1.1% to 1.9% overall during the same period.
    The Kishida Nobusuke government's reactionary agricultural policies have led to the impoverishment of the majority of farmers. Therefore, the production of cash crops has gradually concentrated in the hands of middle-income farmers and above. According to recent data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, it is estimated that about 40% of all farmers are unable to sell agricultural products, and more than 33% are semi-commodity producers, totaling about 75%. Most of these farmers are poor farmers, extremely poor farmers, and agricultural workers. Only about 25% of farmers are fully engaged in commodity production. Most of them are middle-income farmers, including a small number of rich farmers.
    As the prices of agricultural products fall and the farmers' economy becomes increasingly difficult, the labor market has further deteriorated recently. According to a survey by the Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency, among the farmers who flow into cities every year, the number of male laborers aged 20 to 39 decreased by 280,000 in March of the year before last compared with the same period in 1956, but increased by 220,000 in March of last year compared with the year before last. The number of agricultural people who go out to make a living, sell odd jobs, or find other jobs is constantly increasing. It is estimated that there have always been 2.2 million fully unemployed and 6.2 million semi-unemployed people in rural Japan. In this case, the economic oppression suffered by poor farmers, who account for more than half of the farmers, is becoming more and more serious. Especially since the outbreak of the overproduction crisis in the spring of 1957, the prices of agricultural products have fallen further, and the farmer economy has deteriorated further.
    Struggling to Increase Agricultural Product Prices
    Increasing agricultural product prices and increasing farmers' incomes have been major issues of common concern to Japanese farmers for several years. Farmers in various parts of Japan have extremely strong demands for increasing agricultural product prices, and they have launched various struggles for this purpose. The struggle to demand that the government increase rice purchase prices is repeated every year. Farmers in Nagano Prefecture, centered on the All-Japan Farmers' Association since 1957, with the participation of agricultural groups, demanded an increase in milk prices. They conducted group negotiations with the relevant authorities and carried out struggles through other activities. In addition, there are similar activities in Fukushima Prefecture, Hokkaido, and other places.
    Farmers in Gunma, Saitama, Yamanashi, Nagano, and other prefectures have universally launched struggles to strive for higher silkworm cocoon prices. Especially since 1958, while demanding higher cocoon prices, farmers in these places have also demanded that the government compensate farmers for their losses. This loss was caused by the government's regulation to reduce mulberry field planting area by 20%. In addition, struggles to strive for higher sweet potato prices have occurred in some areas of Ibaraki, Chiba, Miyazaki, and other prefectures. Farmers planting tobacco in Iwate, Kanagawa, Ibaraki, and other prefectures are fighting against the government's monopoly company's suppression of purchase prices and for the democratization of "cultivation cooperatives."
    The anti-tax struggle, which had been temporarily dormant, has recently become active again. Dairy farmers and flower farmers (farmers who grow flowers for a living) in Osaka are opposed to the collection of illegal income taxes. The people of Tottori Prefecture, through struggle, stopped the government from sealing up and auctioning off the property of those who could not pay "townspeople's tax." Farmers in some parts of Hokkaido held a conference demanding reductions and exemptions from "fixed asset tax" and achieved victory. Farmers in various villages in Ibaraki Prefecture have also formed "Tax and Donation Countermeasures Associations" since the year before last to fight for the revision of village budgets. The struggle of farmers in Niigata Prefecture to demand tax cuts has achieved victory.
    In addition, farmers all over Japan are constantly carrying out various struggles to oppose illegal land rent, oppose the U.S. military and the Self-Defense Forces requisitioning farmers' land, oppose "land development," "power source development," and road construction that serve monopoly capital, and demand the freedom to reclaim wasteland, etc.
    Farmers' Political Enthusiasm Continues to Grow
    In recent years, Japanese farmers have gradually felt from their own experience that combining political struggle with economic struggle is an important guarantee of victory. In the past one or two years, the enthusiasm of Japanese farmers to participate in political struggles has been continuously increasing. For example, since the autumn of last year, farmers in Nagano, Niigata, Ibaraki, Akita, Iwate, Aichi, Hyogo, Wakayama, Kagawa, Kochi, Miyazaki, and other prefectures have put forward political slogans such as opposing the "performance evaluation system," opposing the revision of the "Police Duties Law," preventing the revision of and striving for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," striving for independence, and defending peace, and have taken various ways to carry out struggles. On June 24 this year, a conference of 800 farmer representatives from 30 prefectures in Japan was held in Tokyo, demanding that the Kishida Nobusuke government increase rice purchase prices. This conference was jointly initiated by the All-Japan Farmers' Association Federation, the National Farmers' Union, and the All-Japan Pioneer League. The representatives attending this conference participated in the unified action on June 25 to prevent the revision of and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Recently, about 1,000 farmers in the northern part of central Japan held a conference in Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture. The conference passed a resolution "opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.'"
    In a recent period, the united front of Japanese farmers' struggles has made new progress. Following the formation of a united front by farmers' associations the year before last, in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last year and the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" this year, the united action of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party has made widespread development on the farmers' struggle front. Their joint struggle organizations can be seen everywhere at the grassroots level. Another noteworthy fact is that farmers have strengthened their combat joint action with the working class, which is of great significance for consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance. Last year, in the struggle against the "Police Duties Law," there were many instances of joint worker-peasant struggles. For example, on November 5 last year, more than 500 farmers in Minamisaku County, Nagano Prefecture, together with workers, participated in the "Lantern Demonstration Rally Against the Revision of the 'Police Duties Law'." This conference was initiated by the local organization of the Japanese Communist Party, and a total of 1,500 people participated in the conference. And recently, thousands and hundreds of farmers in various places have joined workers in participating in the struggle to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    The Kishida Nobusuke group and the Japanese reactionary ruling class have always regarded the countryside as their "consolidated position." However, millions of increasingly awakened farmers are uniting and using various struggles to destroy this "position" of theirs. It is believed that in the future, with the development of the Japanese political situation, the struggle of millions of farmers will give the Kishida Nobusuke group a new and greater blow.

    日本农业现状和农民的斗争
    日本　深谷进
    岸信介的反动的农业政策
    岸信介政府在加紧复活军国主义的同时，通过地方自治机构、“农业合作社”及其它农业团体，以及“新农村建设计划”等等，进一步加强了反动的农业政策。目前，在日本农村中因“土地改革”不彻底而遗留下来的封建残余制度仍然根深蒂固。直到今天，保守反动势力在乡村的政治和社会生活中还有强烈的影响。
    以自由民主党为中心的旧地主势力，组织了“地主联盟”，要求国家对他们在“土改”中被征购的土地给以赔偿。他们想通过这种组织来加强在农村的反动统治，利用农村作为自己在选举中的地盘。他们还在暗中同“全国农民联合会”取得联系，组织“农业山林渔村政治联盟”，在农村集聚反动势力。这个“全国农民联合会”的核心分子中有过去农林省的官僚、“新生活运动协会”，以及保守系统的农业技术团体的领导人。现在，鲇川义介一伙人，又组织了“农村政治联盟”，其性质和“农业山林渔村政治联盟”相同。
    岸信介政府曾在去年发表了“农林渔业政策纲要”（草案）。从这个“纲要”中可以看到，岸信介政府的反动农业政策，不是以占农民半数以上的贫农为对象，而是扶植一部分上层农户，想通过这种办法来维持和加强保守势力在农村的社会支柱。岸信介政府一方面增加为美帝国主义和垄断资本服务的军费及财政投资放款，另一方面却逐年地削减同农民有关的农林预算。它还企图在政治上分化农民的团结，以孤立贫农阶层。
    “谷贱伤农”
    岸信介政府以压低农产品收购价格为手段，迫使农民经济日益陷于困难的境地。从米麦开始直到蚕茧、酪农（一种以饲养乳牛为业的农民，他们用牛粪肥田，并出售牛乳）生产的牛乳、水果、蔬菜等价格，被压低到了成本以下。蔬菜一类农产品的价格，历年来常因季节的变动而有涨落，但从1957年下半年起直到今年为止，蔬菜价格却一直在下跌。而且，除了因偶然的和特殊情况一时出现高价的情况外，价格下跌已波及到一切农产品，成为普遍的倾向。垄断资本家以贱买贵卖的手段，劫掠了农民的大部分收入。例如，他们收购牛乳的价格是每合（约合0.18公升）四日元，而售价却是十五日元。
    商品性的农产品，如蚕茧、牛乳、鸡子、萝卜等蔬菜类的价格下跌得特别厉害。如以1951年为基数，到去年6月这些产品价格分别下跌了9％至33％。至于蚕茧的价格，日本政府更是蛮不讲理地把它从每贯（合3.75公斤）一千四百日元压低到一千日元。相反地，农民们购买的农业用品和家庭日用品的价格，整个来说在同一时期只不过下降1.1％至1.9％。
    岸信介政府的反动农业政策，促使大多数农民贫困化。因此，商品作物的生产便逐渐集中在中农以上的农户手里。据农林省最近的资料估计，在全体农户中无力出售农产品的农户大约占40％，半商品生产的农户占33％强，两者合计达75％左右。这些农民中的大部分是贫农、赤贫农，以及农业工人。完全从事商品生产的农户不过占25％左右而已。其中大部分是中农，还包括一小部分富农。
    随着农产品价格的下跌，农民经济日益困难，因而最近劳动力市场进一步地恶化了。据日本政府经济企划厅调查，每年流入城市的农民当中，像二十岁至三十九岁的男劳动力，前年3月比1956年同期减少了二十八万人，但是去年3月却比前年增加了二十二万人。出外谋生、卖零工或找其它工作的农业人口不断在增加。据估计，日本农村一直就有二百二十万的完全失业者和六百二十万的半失业者。在这种情况下，占农民半数以上的贫农所受的经济压迫越来越严重了。特别是1957年春季爆发生产过剩危机以来，农产品价格更加下跌，农民经济也更加恶化了。
    为提高农产品价格而斗争
    提高农产品价格，增加农民收入，几年来一直是日本农民普遍关心的一个重大问题。日本各地农民对提高农产品价格的要求极为强烈，他们为此展开了各种各样的斗争。要求政府提高大米收购价格的斗争，每年都在反复地进行着。长野县的农民，从1957年以来以全日本农民协会为中心，在农业团体参加之下，要求提高牛乳价格。他们同有关当局进行团体交涉，并通过其它活动来开展斗争。此外，福岛县、北海道及其它地方也有同样的活动。
    群马、埼玉、山梨、长野等县农民，普遍展开了争取提高蚕茧价格的斗争。特别是1958年以来，这些地方的农民在要求提高茧价的同时，还要求政府赔偿农民的损失。这个损失是由政府规定减少桑园种植面积20％所造成的。此外，茨城、千叶、宫崎等县一部分地区发生了争取提高甘薯价格的斗争。岩手、神奈川、茨城等县种植烟草的农民，为反对政府专卖公司压价收购，以及为争取“耕种合作社”的民主化等而进行斗争。
    一时消沉的抗税斗争，最近也活跃起来了。大阪的酪农、花农（以种植鲜花为业的农民）反对征收不正当的所得税。鸟取县的人民群众通过斗争制止了政府查封和拍卖缴不起“町民税”者的财产的作法。北海道一部分地区农民召开大会，要求减免“固定资产税”，并取得了胜利。茨城县各村农民也从前年开始，组成“税金、捐纳对策协会”，为争取修改町村预算而斗争。新潟县农民要求减税的斗争，取得了胜利。
    此外，日本全国各地的农民还不断地开展各种斗争，来反对不正当的地租，反对美军和自卫队征用农民土地，反对为垄断资本服务的“国土开发”、“电源开发”及道路建设，以及要求自由开荒等等。
    农民的政治积极性不断增长
    近几年来，日本农民逐渐从切身体验中感到把政治斗争同经济斗争结合起来，是取得胜利的重要保证。近一、二年来，日本农民参加政治斗争的积极性不断地在提高。比如，从去年秋天以来，长野、新潟、茨城、秋田、岩手、爱知、兵库、和歌山、香川、高知、宫崎等县农民，提出反对“勤务评定制度”、反对修改“警职法”、阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”、争取独立、保卫和平等政治口号，并采取各种方式进行斗争。今年6月24日，日本三十个县的农民代表共八百人在东京举行大会，要求岸信介政府提高大米收购价格。这次大会是全日本农民协会联合会、全国农民联盟、全日本开拓者联盟共同发起召开的。出席这次大会的代表参加了6月25日阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”统一行动。最近中日本北部地区大约有一千名农民在新潟县长冈地方举行了大会。大会通过决议“反对修改日美“安全条约”。
    最近一个时期内，日本农民斗争的统一战线，有了新的发展。继前年农民协会结成统一战线后，在去年反对修改“警职法”斗争和今年反对修改日美“安全条约”斗争中，在农民斗争这条战线上，共产党和社会党的统一行动有了广泛的发展。在基层到处都可以看到他们的联合斗争组织。另外一个值得注意的事实，是农民同工人阶级加强了战斗的联合行动，这对于巩固和发展工农联盟具有重大的意义。去年在反对“警职法”斗争中，出现了许多工农联合斗争的事例。比如，去年11月5日，长野县南佐久郡有五百多名农民同工人一起参加了“反对修改‘警职法’提灯示威游行大会”。这个大会是日共地方组织发起的，参加大会的共有一千五百人。而最近各地则有成千成百的农民同工人一道参加了阻止修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    岸信介集团及日本反动统治阶级一向把农村看作是它们的“巩固阵地”。但是，日益觉醒的千百万农民正在团结起来，以各种斗争来摧毁它们的这块“阵地”。相信今后随着日本政治局势的发展，千百万农民的斗争将给岸信介集团以新的、更大的打击。（附图片）
