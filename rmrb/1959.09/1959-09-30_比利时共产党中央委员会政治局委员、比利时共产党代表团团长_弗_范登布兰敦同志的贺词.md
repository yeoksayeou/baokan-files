Comrade F. Van den Branden, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium and Head of the Delegation of the Communist Party of Belgium, Sends Greetings

Dear Comrades,

Before our arrival in your great country, some Belgian politicians with various views had already come; as far as we know, none of them expressed any criticism of your work. On the contrary, many of them rejoiced at the progress your people have made in the past decade and hoped that our country could freely trade with your country. Among these people who admire your great efforts, some are now members of the Belgian government.

However, the Belgian government still has not recognized People's China. At our urging, the government once declared to the parliament that it is impossible to recognize People's China because People's China is conducting bombing to liberate Chinese territory of Taiwan. At the same time, more than a hundred Congolese sacrificed themselves in Leopoldville for demanding independence.

Our government has consistently voted with the United States government against People's China's entry into the United Nations.

We can assure you that this is completely contrary to the position and interests of the Belgian people. Through the voices of the Communist Party of Belgium, the Democratic Socialist Party, large trade union organizations, liberals, Catholics, etc., the Belgian people have expressed their opinions, advocating the recognition of People's China and the entry of People's China into the United Nations.

Only those with cold war madness would take different actions, attempting to distort the meaning of your grand Great Leap Forward, just as the Belgian and Congolese capitalist trust's mouthpiece "Free Belgium" is doing now.

Some capitalists, in recent years, on the one hand, have allowed their newspapers to clamor for the Cold War, and on the other hand, have gradually expanded the trade volume with the great peaceful China.

The refusal to establish normal relations with the 600 million Chinese people is part of the reason why Belgium currently has 150,000 unemployed workers, many coal mines that can still produce are closed, and the metallurgical industry, textile industry, etc. are in a slump.

Such a backward leap is clearly impossible to make the Belgian people understand the significance of your Great Leap Forward.

We are entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium and are very happy and honored to read to you the congratulatory letter from Comrade Ernest Burnelle, the National Secretary.

	Belgian Communist Party Central Committee Congratulatory Telegram

Dear Comrades,

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium and wish you success.

The Belgian Communists and the Belgian people have watched with great admiration the heroic struggles of your party in various stages for overthrowing foreign oppressors and the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

For ten years, they have watched with the same admiration the actions you have taken to lead the 600 million Chinese workers and peasants towards prosperity, peace and socialism.

Your victorious struggle has powerfully helped our struggle for peace and against capitalist exploitation.

As for us, we are doing our best to improve relations between Belgium and China, to strive for Belgium's recognition of the People's Republic of China, and to strive for the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations.

I wish you complete victory in completing the plan!

Long live the friendship between the Belgian people and the Chinese people!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live peace and socialism!

	The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium
		National Secretary Ernest Burnelle

    比利时共产党中央委员会政治局委员、比利时共产党代表团团长
    弗·范登布兰敦同志的贺词亲爱的同志们：
    在我们来到你们伟大的国家之前，一些具有各种见解的比利时政治家已经来过了；据我们所知，他们里面没有一个人对你们的工作表示过任何非议。相反地，其中有很多人对于你们的人民在十年里所取得的进展感到庆幸，并且希望我国能和你们的国家自由进行贸易。在这些对你们的巨大努力表示钦佩的人们当中，有些现在是比利时政府的成员。
    然而，比利时政府仍然没有承认人民中国。在我们的催促下，政府曾经向议会宣称：由于人民中国为了解放中国领土台湾进行了炮轰，现在不可能承认人民中国。与此同时，一百多名刚果人在利奥波尔得维尔因为要求独立而牺牲了。
    我国政府一直和美国政府一起，投票反对人民中国进入联合国。
    我们可以肯定地向你们讲，这是完全和比利时人民的立场和利益相违背的。通过比利时共产党、民主社会党、大的工会组织、自由人士、天主教人士等的呼声，比利时人民表达了他们的意见，主张承认人民中国，主张人民中国进入联合国。
    只有那些具有冷战狂的分子，才会采取不同的行动，企图歪曲你们的豪迈的大跃进的意义，就像比利时和刚果的资本主义托拉斯的机关报“自由的比利时”，现在所作的那样。
    有一些资本家，最近几年来，一方面让他们的报纸叫嚣冷战，另一方面逐步扩大了和伟大的和平的中国之间的贸易额。
    不肯和六亿中国人民建立正常关系，是比利时目前有十五万工人失业、很多还能生产的煤矿关闭以及冶金工业、纺织工业等萧条的部分原因。
    像这样向后跃退的人显然不可能让比利时人民了解你们的大跃进的意义。
    我们受到比利时共产党中央委员会的委托，非常高兴而且非常荣幸地向你们宣读全国书记埃内斯特·伯内尔同志的贺信。
      比利时共产党中央委员会贺电亲爱的同志们：
    当此中华人民共和国建国十周年的时候，我谨代表比利时共产党中央委员会，向你们致以最热烈的祝贺，祝你们取得成功。
    比利时共产党人和比利时人民曾经以非常赞佩的心情注视你们党为推翻外国压迫者和蒋介石集团的统治所进行的各阶段的英勇斗争。
    十年来，他们以同样赞佩的心情，注视你们为了领导六亿中国工农群众走向繁荣、和平和社会主义而采取的行动。
    你们胜利的斗争有力地帮助了我们为了争取和平、反对资本主义剥削而进行的斗争。
    至于我们，我们正在竭尽全力争取改善比利时和中国的关系，争取比利时承认中华人民共和国，争取中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    谨祝你们在完成计划上取得全面的胜利！
    比利时人民和中国人民的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    和平和社会主义万岁！
     比利时共产党中央委员会
       全国书记埃内斯特·伯内尔　1959年9月29日
