    We are Engaged in the Battle of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

    Our organization and troops of the Henan Military Region, inspired by the communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have rapidly launched a new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy.

    The Henan Military Region has already achieved remarkable results in agricultural and sideline production this year. The entire region has planted more than 1,500 mu of various vegetables and oil crops, and has harvested more than 1 million jin of various vegetables. In addition to self-sufficiency, we have supported the national market with 210,000 jin of vegetables and more than 30,000 jin of pork. In terms of conservation, the use of old materials and adherence to the system of turning in old items for new ones has saved the country more than 400,000 chi of cotton cloth; self-repair and self-construction of roads has saved the country more than 60,000 yuan. After the publication of the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, the enthusiasm of the officers and soldiers of the Henan Military Region was even more encouraged. Comrades said: The resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session have given us unparalleled strength, and we must devote ourselves to the movement of increasing production and practicing economy with greater vigor. On the evening of the 26th, the directly subordinate troops of the Henan Military Region listened to the broadcast of the communique and resolutions. The next morning, before dawn, they went to the suburbs to collect pig feed. Despite the scorching sun and profuse sweating, they were still more motivated than each other, more enthusiastic than each other, and in one morning they collected more than 8,000 jin of wild vegetables. After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, the soldiers of Warehouse 498 expressed that they would add another shooting practice before the National Day to ensure that they would greet the National Day with excellent results.

    At present, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Henan Military Region are full of energy and high morale, determined to guarantee the completion and over-completion of the agricultural and sideline production targets set by the General Political Department for the troops this year while completing various tasks. We will fight hard in September, and greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with excellent training, work, study, and production achievements.

    我们投入了增产节约的战斗
    我们河南军区机关部队，在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，迅速掀起了一个增产节约的新高潮。
    河南军区今年在农、副业生产方面，已经取得了显著的成绩。全区共种各种蔬菜、油料作物一千五百多亩，已收各种蔬菜一百多万斤。除自给以外，支援国家市场蔬菜二十一万斤，猪肉三万多斤。在节约方面，利用旧品、坚持缴旧换新制度一项，就为国家节约棉布四十多万尺；由于自修自筑公路，就为国家节约开支六万多元。党的八中全会文件公布以后，更加鼓舞了河南军区官兵的干劲。同志们说：八中全会决议给我们增加了无比的力量，我们要以更大的干劲，投入增产节约运动。26日晚上，河南军区直属部队收听了公报和决议的广播，第二天早晨天还没亮，他们就到郊区采割猪饲料。尽管烈日炎炎，汗流如洗，他们仍是一个比一个干劲大，一个比一个情绪高，一个上午就采割野菜八千多斤。498仓库战士学习了八中全会决议以后，纷纷表示：要在国庆节前再增加一个射击练习，保证用优异的成绩迎接国庆节。
    目前，河南军区广大官兵，个个精神焕发，斗志昂扬，决心在完成各项任务的同时，保证完成和超额完成总政治部提出的今年部队农、副业生产指标。大战9月份，用优异的训练、工作、学习、生产成绩，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
