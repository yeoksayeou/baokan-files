Hold High the Red Flag of the General Line, Launch a New Upsurge in Labor Emulation
Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee Calls for Boosting Production
    (Our reporter Wu Gang) The Second Enlarged Plenary Session of the Twelfth Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, which began on August 22 and concluded on September 10, heard a report on the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and conducted serious study and discussion. The meeting unanimously agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was a meeting of great historical significance, which greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the whole Party and the people for building socialism and greatly boosted the ongoing movement to increase production and practice economy. All comrades attending the meeting unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and resolutely implemented them. The meeting adopted a decision on implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, calling on Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and all people in the province to oppose right-wing tendencies, boost morale, and vigorously launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party with practical actions.
    The meeting analyzed the current economic situation in Shaanxi and unanimously agreed that the overall trend is very good. The entire province is bright and full of vitality. On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, this year continues to leap forward. From January to August, the total industrial output value of the province completed 62.76% of the annual plan, an increase of 58.5% over the same period last year. The amount of investment completed in capital construction also increased by 31.3% compared with the same period last year. The province's 681 people's communes, after rectification, are more consolidated and have embarked on a path of sound development. The people's communes have won their first summer harvest since their establishment. This year, the province's wheat sown area decreased by about 8% compared with last year, but the total output increased by more than 20% compared with last year. This year, the province's summer grain purchase and storage was the fastest and best completed since liberation. By mid-August, the province had already overfulfilled the state's summer grain purchase task for the province. The purchase of agricultural and sideline products also increased by 89.9% compared with the same period last year. Since the beginning of summer, most areas of the province have successively experienced natural disasters such as drought, insects, floods, wind, and hail to varying degrees. In particular, the drought has lasted for nearly three months, and the drought-affected area accounts for 52.4% of the total autumn crop area, and it is also located in the high-yield grain and cotton areas of Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province are full of revolutionary optimism and have launched a great struggle against these disasters with soaring enthusiasm. The heavily affected Ankang area suffered a drought unseen in a century, but also showed an enthusiasm never seen in history. When small rivers dried up, ponds dried up, and rice fields cracked, 400,000 farmers in the area fought the drought with the spirit of overwhelming mountains and rivers, splitting mountains and digging canals, digging weirs on steep slopes, and digging ditches and rivers to divert water to irrigate fields. In addition to ensuring the water source for the original 340,000 mu of paddy fields, they also expanded the irrigated area by more than 250,000 mu. In particular, recently, under the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of the masses in the province has been boosted again and again, and production has been rising steadily. The total industrial output value of the four industrial cities of Xi'an, Tongchuan, Xianyang, and Baoji increased by 10.18% in mid-August compared with the first ten days of the month, and then increased sharply by 62.69% in the last ten days of the month compared with the middle ten days. Under the slogan of striving to turn heavy disasters into light disasters and light disasters into no disasters, the disaster-stricken areas of Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi launched a movement to resist drought and protect autumn crops; the areas not affected by drought launched a vigorous movement to increase production.
    After analyzing the above situation, the meeting called on the people of the province to carry out the current movement to increase production and practice economy more widely and deeply on the basis of opposing right-wing tendencies, boosting morale, and vigorously launching mass movements, and to strive to complete and overfulfill the state plan. To this end, the meeting proposed to seize the following aspects in a concentrated manner, at all times, and without any slackening. In industry, efforts should be made to overfulfill and complete ahead of schedule the production plans for steel, iron, coal, timber, petroleum, and chemical raw materials. Fully tap the potential in all aspects to achieve high output, high quality, and low cost, and to complete the plan in a comprehensive and balanced manner. In capital construction, priority should be given to completing projects that will be put into production in the first quarter of next year. In agriculture, drought-affected areas should strive to turn heavy disasters into light disasters and light disasters into no disasters; areas not affected by drought should strive for more overproduction; and preparations should be made for autumn harvest and autumn sowing, and preparations should be made for drought-resistant wheat planting. Resolutely implement the principle of "actively running and voluntarily participating," and rectify the canteens of the people's communes before the autumn harvest. In transportation, it is necessary to fully tap the potential, vigorously promote the experience of incidental transportation and round-trip transportation, and launch a mass movement of short-distance transportation. In commerce, it is necessary to actively cooperate with the movement to increase production and practice economy in industry and agriculture, and vigorously organize and improve the purchase and supply of means of production and means of livelihood. While increasing production, all fronts and industries must practice strict economy, rationally arrange and use labor, and save grain, coal, and various materials.
    The meeting used the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party as a weapon to severely criticize the right-leaning opportunist thinking of some cadres in the Party, especially sharply and deeply criticized the various pessimistic and discouraging arguments of those who advocate the "fixed conclusion" of reduced autumn crop production in current agricultural production, and pointed out that the above-mentioned erroneous ideas are the main obstacles to implementing the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and further carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The meeting held that the general line is a sharp weapon for building socialism, and it is a Marxist-Leninist line proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong based on summarizing China's experience in building socialism. It is because of the implementation of the general line that the Great Leap Forward from last year to now has emerged, and unprecedented great victories have been achieved. At present, right-leaning opportunists doubt and negate the general line and criticize the mass movement, which is precisely a reflection of the bourgeois opposition to socialist ideology in society. The meeting pointed out that crushing right-leaning opportunist thinking is the current serious combat task. The meeting also cited many facts to show that as long as right-leaning tendencies are opposed, a little more effort is made, and a little more measures are taken, production will increase a little more; conversely, if right-leaning tendencies are not opposed, a little less effort is made, and a little fewer measures are taken, production will be reduced by more than a little. Therefore, the meeting requires all Party members to continue to study the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in depth, criticize and overcome the right-leaning thoughts of some cadres; requires seizing the opportunity to strive for a bumper autumn harvest and lay a good foundation for next year's wheat harvest; requires every people's commune and all grass-roots organizations of factories and mines to put forward specific figures for overfulfilling the plan and specific dates for completing the plan ahead of schedule, with plans, measures, frequent supervision, and frequent inspections. Everyone should establish the idea of the general line, further set off a high tide of labor emulation in learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, and defend the Party's general line with practical actions to complete the plan for increasing production and practicing economy ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    高高举起总路线红旗　掀起劳动竞赛新高潮
    陕西省委号召鼓劲增产
    本报讯　记者吴钢报道：中共陕西省委二届十二次全体会议（扩大）在8月22日开始，9月10日结束。会议听取了关于党的八届八中全会决议的传达，认真进行了学习和讨论。会议一致认为，党的八届八中全会是有伟大历史意义的一次会议，给全党全民建设社会主义的积极性大大加了劲，给目前正在开展着的增产节约运动大大加了劲。与会全体同志对党的八届八中全会决议一致表示衷心拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。会议通过了关于贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议的决定，号召全省党、团员和全体人民，反右倾，鼓干劲，大搞增产节约群众运动，用实际行动响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召。
    会议分析了当前陕西的经济形势，一致认为大势很好。全省一片光明，生气勃勃。在去年大跃进的基础上，今年仍然在继续跃进。1至8月份，全省工业总产值完成了年计划的62.76％，比去年同期增长58.5％，基本建设完成的投资额也较去年同期增长31.3％。全省六百八十一个人民公社，经过整顿，更加巩固，已经走上健全发展的道路。人民公社已赢得了它成立后的第一个夏季丰收。今年全省小麦播种面积比去年减少约8％，总产量却比去年增加20％以上。今年全省夏季征购粮入仓是解放后历年来完成得最快、最好的一次，到8月中旬，已经超额完成了国家给全省的夏季征购粮任务。农副产品的收购也比去年同期增加89.9％。入夏以来，全省大部分地区不同程度地相继发生了旱、虫、洪、风、雹等自然灾害。尤其是旱灾持续已近三个月，受旱面积占秋田总面积52.4％，且又在关中和陕南粮、棉高产区。但是，全省人民在党的领导下，充满了革命乐观主义精神，以冲天的干劲向这些灾害开展了伟大的斗争。重灾的安康专区遭到百年来所没有的旱灾，但也出现了历史上从来所没有的干劲。当小河断流、池塘干涸、稻田龟裂时，全区四十万农民以气吞山河的气概大战干旱，劈山凿渠，陡坡挖堰，掏沟挖河，截流架涧来引水灌田，除保证了原三十四万多亩水田水源外，还扩大灌溉面积二十五万多亩。特别是最近在党的八届八中全会号召下，全省群众的干劲一鼓再鼓，生产节节上升。西安、铜川、咸阳、宝鸡四个工业城市工业生产总值，8月中旬比上旬增长10.18％，下旬又比中旬猛增62.69％。关中和陕南受灾地区在力争重灾变轻灾、轻灾变无灾的口号下，展开了抗旱保秋运动；不受旱的地区，开展了轰轰烈烈的超产运动。
    会议在分析了上述形势后，号召全省人民在反右倾，鼓干劲，大搞群众运动的基础上，把目前的增产节约运动更广泛、更深入地开展起来，力争完成和超额完成国家计划。为此，会议提出要突击的抓、时时抓、一刻也不放松的抓下列几个方面。工业方面，要力争超额和提前完成钢、铁、煤、木材、石油、化工原料生产计划。充分挖掘各方面的潜力，达到高产优质、低成本，并全面地均衡地完成计划。基本建设上要优先完成明年第一季度投入生产的工程。农业方面，受旱地区要力争重灾变轻灾、轻灾变无灾；不受旱的地区力争更多超产；作好秋收、秋播准备工作，准备抗旱种麦。坚决贯彻“积极办好、自愿参加”的原则，在秋收前整顿好人民公社食堂。运输方面要充分挖掘潜力，大力推广捎脚运输和往返运输的经验，开展短途运输的群众运动。商业方面“要积极配合工农业增产节约运动，大力组织、改善生产资料和生活资料的收购和供应。各个战线、各个行业在增产的同时，要厉行节约，合理安排和使用劳动力，节约粮食、煤炭和各种材料。
    会议以党的八届八中全会的精神为武器，严肃批判了党内某些干部的右倾机会主义思想，特别是尖锐而深刻地批判了当前农业生产上秋田减产“定局论”者各色各样的悲观泄气论调，并且指出上述这些错误思想，是贯彻执行八中全会决议和进一步开展增产节约运动的主要障碍。会议认为，总路线是建设社会主义的锐利武器，是毛泽东同志总结了我国建设社会主义经验提出的一条马克思列宁主义的路线。由于贯彻执行总路线，才出现了去年到现在的大跃进，取得了史无前例的伟大胜利。目前右倾机会主义者怀疑和否定总路线和非难群众运动，正是社会上资产阶级反对社会主义思潮的反映。会议指出粉碎右倾机会主义思想，是目前的严重战斗任务。会议还列举许多事实说明，只要反掉右倾，多鼓一分干劲，多加一分措施，就能多增产一分；反之，不反右倾，泄一分劲，少一分措施，就不止减产一分。因此，会议要求全体党员继续深入学习党的八届八中全会的文件，批判和克服一些干部中的右倾思想；要求抓紧时机，争取秋季丰收和给明年小麦丰收打好基础；要求每个人民公社和厂矿企业所有基层组织，都提出本单位超额完成计划的具体数字和提前完成计划的具体日期，有计划、有措施、勤督促、勤检查。人人树立总路线思想，进一步掀起学先进、赶先进、超先进的劳动竞赛高潮，用提前和超额完成增产节约计划的实际行动保卫党的总路线。
