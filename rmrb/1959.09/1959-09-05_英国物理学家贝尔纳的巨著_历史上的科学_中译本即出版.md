Xinhua News Agency, 4th: British physicist Professor Bernal, Executive Chairman of the World Peace Council Presidium and outstanding peace fighter, has had his magnum opus "Science in History" translated into Chinese, and it will be published by Science Press at the end of September.

This is a monumental work of approximately 700,000 words. Based on significant scientific events and the activities of scientists throughout history, the book provides readers with a brilliant demonstration that science originates from production practice. The book starts from the Paleolithic Age and continues to the present. While the content focuses on natural sciences (physics, mathematics, earth science, and biological sciences) and technology, the book particularly emphasizes the interrelationship between the development of science and social development, with two chapters specifically addressing this issue. The book is divided into seven parts and fourteen chapters, with fourteen illustrations and four plates.

This book has already been translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union. The Chinese translation is based on the revised second edition, and the author recently made some new revisions and enthusiastically wrote a preface for the publication of the Chinese translation.
