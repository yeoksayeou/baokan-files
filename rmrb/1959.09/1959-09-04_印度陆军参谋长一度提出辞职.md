Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 3rd: New Delhi dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the People's Assembly on the 2nd that Indian Army Chief of Staff Thimayya had formally submitted his resignation on August 31st, but later withdrew his resignation upon Nehru's advice.

According to a dispatch from a Kyodo News Agency correspondent in New Delhi, people in New Delhi are secretly talking about: "Interior Minister Pant, Finance Minister Desai and other right-wing elements of the Congress Party are instigating Chief of Staff Thimayya and others in order to drive away Minister Menon."

At the meeting of the People's Assembly on the 2nd, Kripalani, Asoka Mehta of the People's Socialist Party, and some members of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Congress Party insisted on debating the issue of Thimayya's resignation.

In his speech, Nehru praised Menon's work and also praised the work of officers and soldiers of the armed forces.

Nehru's speech caused an uproar among some opposition party members.

Communist Party member Mukerjee opposed the provisional motion proposed by People's Socialist Party and other party members to debate the issue of Thimayya's resignation. He said, "It is very disturbing that the news of Thimayya's resignation was leaked to the press and used by parties with vested interests."

    印度陆军参谋长一度提出辞职
    据新华社3日讯　新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁2日在人民院中说，印度陆军参谋长蒂迈雅曾经在8月31日正式提出辞职，后来接受了尼赫鲁的建议又撤回辞呈。
    据共同社新德里特派记者报道，新德里的人们正在背地里谈论着：“内政部长潘特、财政部长德赛等国大党右翼为了撵走梅农部长，正在挑唆蒂迈雅参谋长等人。”
    在人民院2日举行的会议上，人民社会党的克里帕拉尼、阿索卡、梅达以及自由党和民主大会党的一些议员坚持要求就蒂迈雅辞职的问题进行辩论。
    尼赫鲁在发言中赞扬了梅农的工作，也赞扬了武装部队官兵的工作。
    尼赫鲁的讲话引起一些反对党议员的大吵大嚷。
    共产党议员慕克吉反对人民社会党等党派议员提出的关于就蒂迈雅辞职问题进行辩论的临时动议。他说，“蒂迈雅辞职的消息竟传到报界，并且被有利害关系的政党利用，这是十分令人不安的。”
