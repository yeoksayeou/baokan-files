(From our dispatch) Sichuan province's more than 500,000 public canteens in rural areas are running better and better. Over the past year, they have demonstrated their superiority in promoting production development, overcoming natural disasters, and improving people's lives, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.

As early as before the establishment of the communes, farmers in various parts of Sichuan spontaneously organized a large number of farm-busy-season canteens. By July of last year, there were more than 372,000 farm-busy-season canteens in the province, with more than 28 million people participating. At that time, those eating in canteens reached 45.3% of the rural population. With the establishment and development of the communes, these canteens were successively converted into year-round canteens at the urgent request of the masses, and 95% of the agricultural population voluntarily participated in the public canteens. While focusing on production, Party committees at all levels also paid great attention to life and strengthened leadership over the public canteens. The Party committees of most communes have established canteen experimental fields and have assigned special personnel to be responsible for canteen work. Some Party committee secretaries also regularly work as cooks in the canteens, continuously improving the work of the canteens. Since January of this year, various places have also carried out systematic rectification of the canteens and established necessary management systems, thereby making the canteens universally consolidated and improved.

Public canteens not only facilitate people's lives but also facilitate production. Because people eat together in the canteens, they go to work and finish work neatly. The attendance rate has not only increased by 10% to 20%, but each person works one or two hours more per day than in the past. At the same time, a large number of women have been liberated from the burdens of cooking and housework and have participated in social production labor. Xinfan County originally had 28,000 women suffering from the burden of housework, unable to or rarely able to go to work. Since the establishment of various collective welfare organizations centered on public canteens, 2,200 cooks and 4,800 nursery workers in the county have replaced their main housework, enabling them to concentrate on collective production activities. According to a survey of Xintian, Wangjia, and Huangsha communes in Nanxi County, only more than 2,000 women regularly went to work before the establishment of the canteens, but after the establishment of the canteens, the number reached more than 7,600, and the attendance rate was often maintained at around 98%. According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, more than 10 million women's labor force has been liberated in the province, and 70% of them have been投入 into the front line of production, making greater contributions to production. During the great battle of "Four Autumns" last year, when millions of laborers went to the mountains to make steel, the women and the male laborers who stayed behind fought side by side, successfully completing the tasks of autumn harvesting, autumn storage, and autumn planting, and deep plowing about 48 million mu of land to a depth of one foot or so; in the small spring field management and manure accumulation, thousands of professional teams were mainly composed of women. The fact that the province's small spring grain crop output this year can increase by 30% compared to last year is inseparable from the glorious labor of women in field management.

The people's communes have implemented a wage system that combines half-wage and half-supply, and have established public canteens, which have freed the vast majority of farmers from the heavy burden that has been weighing on them for thousands of years, especially providing the most reliable guarantee for the lives of approximately 20 million poor farmers (accounting for 30% of the total population) throughout the province, and their enthusiasm for production has soared to unprecedented heights. They describe their feelings after joining the public canteen as "one concern and a hundred worries gone." "Hundred worries gone" means that they no longer have to worry about eating, drinking, oil, salt, firewood, and rice; "one concern" is concerning themselves with how to make production better.

In order to improve the lives of commune members and enable everyone to eat their fill, eat well, and eat frugally, people's communes have allocated a certain amount of vegetable and feed land to be managed uniformly by the canteens for raising pigs and growing vegetables. Due to the good vegetable planting in the 4,400 public canteens in Wusheng County, under the current drought conditions, 2,600 canteens enable commune members to eat three jin of vegetables per person per day, and more than 1,700 canteens enable commune members to eat two jin of vegetables per person per day. In addition to self-consumption, in the past month, the canteens have also sold more than 2 million jin of vegetables to organs, schools, and factories. Many canteens use the money from selling vegetables as expenses for buying oil, salt, and seasonings, saving a lot of money. The eight canteens of the Fifth Brigade of Yangkou Commune have an income of more than 2,700 yuan from selling vegetables alone. Many canteens use the accumulated money to add equipment such as boiling water buckets, water filter tanks, bathtubs, and spittoons. Commune members feel more comfortable in the canteens than at home.

Public canteens throughout the province also pay attention to meeting the diverse needs of commune members. In addition to providing separate care for the elderly, weak, sick, young, and pregnant women in terms of fine grain and vegetable and oil supply, commune members participating in the canteens are also allowed to make their own side dishes, and can take back grain and vegetables from the canteen to cook and eat themselves during holidays, festivals, or special needs such as entertaining guests. Generally, the canteens can provide three meals a day during busy farming seasons and two meals a day during slack farming seasons, with a combination of coarse and fine grains, dry and thin foods, vegetables and soups, and cleanliness and hygiene. The food in many public canteens in Wenjiang, Neijiang, Leshan, and other special areas has caught up with and exceeded the average level of local wealthy middle peasants.

After the recent vigorous anti-drought struggle, the prestige of the public canteens has been further enhanced. This year, the drought-affected area in the province reached more than 60 million mu of cultivated land, lasting for more than two months. The situation was serious and unprecedented in the past 30 years, but thanks to the strong leadership of the Party and the superiority of the people's communes, each canteen was able to continue to provide meals as usual, ensuring that commune members were fed, and that people did not suffer from hunger and livestock did not decrease. As a result, the vast disaster areas had stable morale and high fighting spirit. An old farmer in Dazhu County said: "The people's communes have two halls, so we are not afraid of drought. One is the canteen; the other is the pond. With the canteen, we can eat our fill and have great energy; with the pond, we have water to irrigate the seedlings." Many canteens in Fuling and Dazhou special areas organized mobile canteens, delivering food, vegetables, and boiling water to the construction sites, greatly inspiring the morale of the anti-drought army. The people's communes in Fuling special area irrigated a total of more than 3.7 million mu of land once or twice in one go. The Dazhou special area found more than 180,000 underground water sources such as dragon cave water and coal mine water in half a month, dug more than ten wells, and irrigated more than 5.6 million mu of irrigated crops. Recently, when summarizing the great victory against drought, commune members praised the people's communes and praised the public canteens for making great contributions. Deng Liuji, a 61-year-old commune member of Shitou Commune in Mianyang County, said: "The drought in the Wuxu year was nothing more than this. At that time, we ate grass roots and tree bark, and we didn't see a grain of rice for half a year. We were so hungry that we staggered when we walked. Who had the strength to fight the drought? Now that we are suffering from drought, the public canteens have rice and vegetables for every meal, and everyone is full of energy. No matter how fierce the drought is, there is no reason why we can't conquer it."

The facts of the past year show that public canteens also have many advantages in saving grain, fuel, and utensils. Public canteens in various places often conduct education on increasing production and saving, and planned grain use for commune members, and promoted the grain use method of "quantifying according to people, distributing to households, eating in canteens, and saving by oneself." As a result of the implementation of this method, not only is it guaranteed that commune members eat their fill, but it also promotes the spirit of saving grain and thrift. In the past, some commune members in the Hongqi People's Commune in Pengxi County always lacked grain in April and May. Since the establishment of the commune and the public canteen, the slogan of "bran and vegetable half a year's grain, running the canteen thriftily, everyone calculates what to eat, and every household saves grain" has been put forward. A large amount of vegetables are planted and careful calculations are made. As a result, in May and June, the canteen collectively saved more than 236,000 jin of grain, and the commune members individually saved more than 64,000 jin. By mid-August, each canteen still had more than 260,000 jin of old grain from last year and this year's grain, with an average of 32 jin per person. Without eating a single grain of spring grain, they can eat for 40 to 50 days. In terms of firewood, according to typical surveys, when cooking separately in the past, each person had to burn about three jin of firewood and charcoal per day, while cooking in the canteen only required an average of one and a half jin per person.

Supply and marketing cooperatives, barber shops, sewing shops, post and telecommunications, credit and other organizations have been established around the public canteens to serve commune members. At the same time, big-character posters, mobilization stations, and leap forward appraisal platforms have also been established to read newspapers, broadcast, and conduct political and cultural propaganda and education for commune members during meal times and after-meal rest periods. Many public canteens have now become activity centers for rural economic, political propaganda, and cultural entertainment.

### 不再操心柴米油盐　一心一意搞好生产  四川95％社员参加食堂  解放妇女劳动力一千多万人，出勤率普遍提高10—20％

    不再操心柴米油盐　一心一意搞好生产
    四川95％社员参加食堂
    解放妇女劳动力一千多万人，出勤率普遍提高10—20％
    本报讯　四川省农村五十多万个公共食堂越办越好，一年来在促进生产发展、战胜自然灾害和改善群众生活等方面显示了优越性，受到广大社员的热烈欢迎。
    早在公社成立之前，四川各地农民就自发地组织大量农忙食堂。去年7月份，全省农忙食堂已有三十七万二千多个，有两千八百多万人参加。当时在食堂搭伙的已达农村人口的45.3％。随着公社的建立和发展，这些食堂在群众的迫切要求下先后转为常年食堂，95％的农业人口自愿参加了公共食堂。各级党委在抓生产的同时也十分注意抓生活，加强对公共食堂的领导。各公社党委大都建立有食堂试验田，设有专人负责食堂工作，有的党委书记还定期到食堂当炊事员，不断改进食堂工作。今年1月份起，各地又对食堂进行了系统整顿，建立了必要的管理制度，从而使食堂普遍巩固提高。
    公共食堂不仅便利了群众生活，同时也便利了生产。由于人们在食堂一起吃饭，出工、收工整齐，出勤率不但增加了10％到20％，而且每人每天要比过去多做一两小时活路。同时，大批妇女从锅台灶边家务拖累中解放出来，参加了社会生产劳动。新繁县原有二万八千个妇女身受家务拖累，不能或很少出工。自从建立了以公共食堂为中心的各项集体福利组织后，全县二千二百多个炊事员和四千八百多个保育员就代替了她们的主要家务劳动，使她们能够集中精力从事集体的生产活动。南溪县在新添、汪家、黄沙等三个公社调查，食堂成立前经常出工的妇女只有二千多人，食堂成立后达到七千六百多人，出勤率经常保持在98％左右。据有关部门不完全统计，全省解放出来的妇女劳动力有一千多万人，而且70％投入了生产第一线，为生产作出更大贡献。去年大战“四秋”时，当几百万劳动力上山炼钢铁，妇女们和留下的男劳力并肩作战，胜利完成了秋收、秋藏、秋种任务，并使四千八百多万亩土地深耕一尺左右；小春田间管理和积肥中，数以千计的专业队都是以妇女为主力。今年全省小春粮食作物产量能比去年增产30％，是与妇女们在田间管理中的光辉劳动分不开的。
    人民公社实行了半工资半供给制相结合的工资制度，举办了公共食堂，使绝大多数农民去掉了千百年来压在身上的沉重担子，特别是使全省约二千多万贫苦农民（占总人口的30％）生活有了最可靠的保证，生产积极性空前高涨。他们描写参加了公共食堂后的心情是“一焦百不愁”。“百不愁”是说：吃、喝、油、盐、柴、米百事都不用愁了；“一焦”是焦心如何把生产搞得更好。
    为了改善社员生活，使大家吃饱、吃好、吃省，各人民公社都划拨出一定数量的蔬菜和饲料地，由食堂统一经营，用来养猪、种菜。武胜县四千四百多个公共食堂由于蔬菜种得好，在目前天旱的情况下，有二千六百个食堂使社员每人每天能吃到三斤蔬菜，有一千七百多个食堂每人每天吃到二斤蔬菜。除了自食外，最近一月内，各食堂还卖给机关、学校、工厂二百多万斤蔬菜。不少食堂用卖菜的钱作为买油盐、调料的开支，结余了不少钱。沿口公社五大队的八个食堂，仅卖小菜的收入就有二千七百多元。许多食堂用积累的钱添置了一些开水桶、滤水缸、洗澡盆、痰盂等设备，社员们感到在食堂比家里还舒适。
    全省各公共食堂还注意满足社员多种多样的需要。除对老、弱、病、幼、孕妇等在细粮和菜、油供应方面另有照顾外，还允许参加食堂的社员自做小菜，在假日、节日或招待客人等特殊需要时，可从食堂领回粮、菜自做自吃。一般食堂都能做到农忙时一日三餐，农闲时两餐，粗、细粮兼搭，有干有稀，有菜有汤，清洁卫生。温江、内江、乐山等专区许多公共食堂的伙食已赶上和超过了当地富裕中农的平均水平。
    经过最近轰轰烈烈的抗旱斗争，公共食堂的威信更加提高。今年全省受旱面积达六千多万亩耕地，持续两个多月，情况严重是三十多年来没有的，但是由于党的坚强领导，由于人民公社发挥了优越性，各个食堂照常开伙，保证社员吃饱，做到人不受饥饿牲畜不减少，因而广大灾区人心安定，斗志昂扬。大竹县有个老农说：人民公社有二堂，不怕干旱。一是食堂；二是堰塘。有了食堂，吃得饱，干劲大；有了堰塘，有水灌苗。涪陵、达县等专区许多食堂组织了随军食堂，把菜饭、开水送到工地，大大激励了抗旱大军的士气。涪陵专区各人民公社一鼓作气把三百七十多万亩土地普遍浇灌了一次到二次。达县专区在半月内就找出龙洞水、煤井水等地下水源十八万多处，打井十多口，浇灌了五百六十多万亩受灌作物。最近各地在总结抗旱的伟大胜利时，社员们交口称赞人民公社，称赞公共食堂立了大功。绵阳县石塘公社六十一岁的老社员邓六基说：戊戌年干旱不过如此，那时吃草根树皮，半年不见一粒米，饿的走路都东偏西倒，谁还有力抗旱；如今受旱，公共食堂顿顿有饭有菜，吃得人人浑身是劲，干旱再凶，哪有制不服的道理。
    一年来的事实说明，公共食堂在节约粮食、燃料和用具上也有很多优越性。各地公共食堂都经常向社员进行增产节约、计划用粮的教育，推广了“按人定量、分配到户、食堂吃饭、节约自得”的用粮办法。这一办法实行的结果，不仅保证社员吃饱，还促进了节约粮食和勤俭持家的风气。蓬溪县红旗人民公社，过去每到4、5月间总要有部分社员缺粮，自成立公社举办了公共食堂后，提出“糠菜半年粮、勤俭办食堂、人人算了吃、户户节约粮”的口号，大种蔬菜，精打细算，结果在5、6两个月内，食堂集体节约粮食二十三万六千多斤，社员个人节约六万四千多斤。到8月中，各食堂还有去年陈粮和今年粮食二十六万多斤，每人平均有三十二斤，不吃一粒大春粮食，也能吃四、五十天。公共食堂在用柴方面，据典型调查，以前分散做饭时每人每天要烧柴炭三斤左右，食堂做饭平均每人只要一斤半就够了。
    各地在公共食堂周围建立有供销部、理发、缝纫、邮电、信贷等组织，为社员服务。同时还建立了大字报、鼓动站、跃进评比台等设施，利用吃饭和饭后休息时间，给社员读报、广播，进行政治文化宣传教育。许多公共食堂现今已成了农村经济、政治宣传和文化娱乐的活动中心。　（刘宗棠）
