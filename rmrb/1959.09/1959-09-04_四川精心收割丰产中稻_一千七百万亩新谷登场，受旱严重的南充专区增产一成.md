Chengdu, September 3rd (from our newspaper) — The harvesting of Sichuan Province's 39 million mu of mid-season rice has entered its most intense phase. The province's 5,100+ communes are fully utilizing the superior conditions of the communes, harvesting in a timely manner, meticulously gathering, and thoroughly implementing the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy in every aspect of the autumn harvest.

As of September 1st, from both sides of the Yangtze River to the Daba Mountains and the Sichuan West Plain, known as the granary, millions of harvesters have already cut 17 million mu of mid-season rice, nearly half of the province's mid-season rice area.

Since the start of the harvest, successive reports of large-scale bumper harvests of mid-season rice have been reported from various places. The four million mu of rice in Nanchong Prefecture, which suffered from drought, has already been harvested 80%, and the general yield per mu has increased by 10% compared to last year. Rong County's 90,000 mu of harvested mid-season rice has seen an average increase of 17% per mu compared to last year. Wusheng County has 70,000 mu of mid-season rice with an average increase of 37% per mu. The Dongfeng Commune in Xichong County has more than 15,000 mu of mid-season rice, with an average increase of 70% per mu. The Huqiao Commune in Xinjin County on the West Sichuan Plain harvested more than 1,200 mu of mid-season rice with an average yield of more than 870 jin per mu, with the highest reaching more than 1,200 jin.

This year, Sichuan Province's bumper harvest of mid-season rice was obtained in the midst of continuous struggle against various natural disasters. In May and June, during the rice planting and early growth stages, some areas experienced rare droughts that had not been seen in many years. The affected area accounted for more than half of the province's cultivated land. Under the leadership of the local Party committees, the people's communes gave full play to the superiority of having a large population and strong labor force, organizing a large army to fight drought, using waterwheels, foot-operated water lifts, carrying water, and finding water sources, digging wells, and excavating spring pits to fight drought, planting rice seedlings, and irrigating to protect seedlings. Mianyang, Wenjiang, and other prefectures encountered torrential rains and mountain floods in the later stages of mid-season rice growth, and promptly organized forces to prevent floods, drain water, and prop up the lodged rice, ensuring the normal growth of rice. In the Jiangjin Prefecture, more than one million insect control soldiers were mobilized in the management of mid-season rice to prevent rice borers and eliminate rice blast.

The communique and resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party gave tremendous encouragement to the commune members on the Sichuan autumn harvest front. The communes decided to make persistent efforts to win the battle of autumn harvest. The communes mobilized the entire commune's crack troops to the front line of the autumn harvest. Cadres were assigned to specific areas to take responsibility, established harvesting teams, implemented a contract labor system, and launched a high-efficiency, high-quality movement. According to each commune member's specialty and physical strength, they were divided into cutting, threshing, transporting, drying, picking, and warehousing teams, using threshing machines or pedal threshers as the center for rush harvesting, greatly accelerating the harvesting progress. The harvesting progress in the Daxian Prefecture has increased by 25% in the last four days. Many communes have also summarized last year's experiences and lessons, made full preparations to ensure fast, good harvesting, good drying, and good storage. Guanyin District in Yibin County has experienced continuous rain in recent days. In order to prevent the ripe mid-season rice from lodging and sprouting, the communes mobilized more than 30,000 people to brave the rain to rush harvesting. More than 10,000 logistics soldiers built kang stoves and cleared houses to dry the rice by using kang, baking, and spreading. The Ganjiang Commune in Jiajiang County accepted the lessons of losses caused by insufficient warehouse capacity last year, generally inspected warehouses, adopted methods such as rebuilding, building new ones, and repairing to prepare sufficient storage locations, and also trained more than 100 custodians and established a management system.

With the widespread development of the increase production and practice economy movement, meticulous harvesting and ensuring that every grain is returned to the granary have become a mass movement. Many counties have established meticulous harvesting command posts, put forward the slogan of increasing production in the fields, threshing floors, and drying grounds, and led the masses to improve various harvesting techniques through on-site meetings, small exhibitions, and accounting for waste and losses. A large number of threshing machines have been promoted in various places, adding covers, enclosures, and bamboo undercatchers to the pedal threshers to reduce scattering. Nanchong County used on-site comparison methods to prove that threshing machines can indeed reduce scattering compared to pedal threshers, so iron and woodworking workers were mobilized to rush to produce and promote them overnight. Thousands of children also picked up rice grains along with the rush harvesting army. Wusheng County dispatched 19,000 children, who picked up more than 87,000 jin of rice in seven days.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 3rd – In recent days, people's communes in various parts of Sichuan Province have successively convened oath-taking rallies, discussion meetings, and forums to analyze the current favorable situation, discuss and revise production increase plans, increase their efforts, add measures, and turn the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party into practical actions to increase production and practice economy. The 500,000 rural people of Mianyang County, who overcame a severe drought, put forward the slogan "We must turn serious disaster into increased production." According to the increased production targets revised by each people's commune, they are determined to increase grain production by more than 10% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, even under disaster conditions. The Fuming People's Commune in Nanxi County, which achieved increased production in all thirteen crops this year, expressed that they would never be complacent, but would make persistent efforts to strive for a great harvest of late autumn crops, and put forward the battle cry of "Single-season late rice exceeds mid-season rice, double-season late rice exceeds early rice, and late autumn crops exceed summer crops."

    四川精心收割丰产中稻
    一千七百万亩新谷登场，受旱严重的南充专区增产一成
    本报成都3日电　四川省三千九百多万亩中稻的收割工作进入最紧张的阶段。全省五千一百多个公社，充分运用公社的优越条件，适时收割，精收细打，把增产节约的精神贯彻到秋收的每一个环节中。
    到1日止，从长江两岸到大巴山区以及素有谷仓之称的川西平原，千百万收割大军已经割完中稻一千七百万亩，将近全省中稻面积一半。
    开镰以来，各地相继传出了中稻大面积丰收的捷报。曾经遭受旱灾的南充专区的四百万亩水稻，已经收割80％，一般亩产比去年增加10％。荣县收割的九万亩中稻，平均每亩比去年增产17％。武胜县有七万亩中稻，平均每亩增产37％。西充县东风公社一万五千多亩中稻，平均每亩增产70％。川西平原上的新津县花桥公社收割的一千二百多亩中稻，平均亩产八百七十多斤，最高的达到一千二百多斤。
    今年，四川省中稻丰收是在不断同各种自然灾害作斗争中获得的。在5、6月份水稻栽插和生长初期，部分地区发生了多年来少有的旱灾，受灾面积占全省耕地面积一半以上。各地人民公社在当地党委领导下，充分发挥公社人多力大的优越性，组织了抗旱大军，车水、戽水、挑水和找水源、打井、挖泉坑，抗旱插秧和灌水保苗。绵阳、温江等专区，在中稻生长后期遇到暴雨和山洪袭击，又及时组织了力量防洪、排涝和扶起倒伏的稻子，保证了水稻正常生长。江津专区各地在中稻管理中曾出动了上百万的治虫大军，防治了螟虫和扑灭了稻瘟病。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议，给四川秋收战线上的公社社员们以巨大的鼓舞。各公社决定再接再厉，打好秋收这一仗。各公社调动了全社精兵到秋收第一线。干部分片包干负责，建立收割小组，实行包工制，开展高工效高质量运动。并根据每个社员的特长和体力，分为割、打、运、晒、拣和入仓等小组，以打谷机或扮桶为中心进行抢收，大大加快了收割进度。达县专区的收割进度，最近四天之内增快了25％。许多公社还总结了去年的经验教训，作好充分准备，保证作到收快、收好、晒好、保管好。宜宾县观音区最近连日落雨，为了防止黄熟的中稻倒伏生芽，各公社动员了三万多人冒雨抢割、抢收。一万多名后勤战士在屋里打炕灶、腾房子，采取炕、烘、摊晾等办法，把稻谷弄干。夹江县甘江公社，接受去年因仓容不足而造成损失的教训，普遍检查了仓库，采取改建、兴建、修补等办法，准备了足够的收储地点，还训练了一百多名保管员，建立了保管制度。
    随着增产节约运动的广泛开展，精收细打和颗粒归仓已形成群众性运动。许多县成立精打细收指挥部，提出田里、扮桶、晒场三处增产的口号，通过现场会、小型展览会和算浪费损失账，领导群众改进各种收打技术。各地大量推广了打谷机，在扮桶上加篷、加围、加竹下兜，减少抛撒。南充县用现场对比办法，证明打谷机确能比扮桶减少抛撒，就发动铁木工人连夜赶制推广。成千上万的儿童也随着抢收大军拣拾稻谷。武胜县出动了一万九千名儿童，七天中就拣回了稻谷八万七千多斤。
    据新华社成都3日电　四川省各地人民公社连日来陆续召开誓师大会、讨论会、座谈会，分析当前有利形势，讨论修订增产计划，加干劲、添措施，把党的八届八中全会决议变为增产节约的实际行动。战胜严重干旱的绵阳县五十万农村人民，提出了“一定要把重灾变为增产”的口号。根据各人民公社修订的增产指标，他们决心在受灾情况下使粮食产量仍然要比大跃进的1958年增产10％以上。今年获得了十三种农作物样样增产的南溪县阜鸣人民公社，社员们表示决不自满，要再接再厉争取晚秋作物大丰收，并且提出了“单季晚稻超中稻，双季晚稻超早稻，晚秋作物超夏熟作物”的战斗口号。（附图片）
