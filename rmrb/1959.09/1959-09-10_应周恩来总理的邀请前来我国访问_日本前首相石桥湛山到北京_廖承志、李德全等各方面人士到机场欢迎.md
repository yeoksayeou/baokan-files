Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: Former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, his wife, and a delegation of twelve people arrived in Beijing by plane from Guangzhou this afternoon at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai to visit China.

Tanzan Ishibashi made the following statement at Beijing Airport:

"This time, we are visiting your country at the invitation of Premier Zhou. Three years ago, when I formed the cabinet, I decided to normalize Japan-China relations as one of the diplomatic policies. After a period of time, I fell ill and resigned from the position of Prime Minister, and as a result, I was unable to realize my wishes until today. Fortunately, my illness has improved, so I was eager to carry out my long-cherished wish and decided to visit your country.

"The development of your country is the development of Asia. I am very happy to be able to see the development of your country with my own eyes. I deeply feel that the 600 million Chinese people who have built a great culture since ancient times and the 100 million Japanese people who first established an industrialized country in Asia since the Meiji Restoration should cooperate closely to maintain peace in Asia and the world, and strive to increase the happiness of the people of the East. This is the responsibility of Japan and China, and it is also an obligation to mankind.

"For the past two thousand years, Japan has always received help from Chinese culture and has held feelings of gratitude and respect for the Chinese people. Unfortunately, recently, some unfortunate things happened that caused serious damage to the Chinese people, which I feel extremely regretful for. The Japanese people have also deeply reflected on this, and I beg you not to be too harsh in your condemnation.

"I personally hope that the people of the two countries will truly continue to have warm exchanges in the future with the feelings of brothers and sisters. My visit to your country this time is to realize the above wish.

"I accepted Premier Zhou's invitation to visit your country, but I regret that the time I can stay is very short. If I can open up an opportunity for the happiness of Japan and China, I will feel very happy."

Those who came to the airport to welcome him today included Liao Chengzhi, Li Dequan, Cai Tingkai, Xu Guangping, Wang Kunlun, Yang Hansheng, Liu Xiyuan, Zhao Puchu, Wu Maosun, Xie Nanguang, and other representatives from various circles.

Mr. and Mrs. Kinkazu Saionji, Japanese peace activists in Beijing, also came to the airport to welcome him.

The main members of Tanzan Ishibashi's entourage included: Tokuma Utsunomiya, Tsuneo Kato, Kamekichi Takahashi, and Kazuo Suzuki.

When Tanzan Ishibashi and others passed through Wuhan, they took a short rest and were welcomed and seen off by Xie Ziqun, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 9th: Former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, his wife, and a delegation of twelve people left Guangzhou by plane at 8:00 a.m. today for Beijing. Sun Pinghua, Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, accompanied them.

Those who saw them off at the airport included Lin Qiangyun, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Jiao Linyi, Vice Mayor of Guangzhou, Du Guoxiang, Deputy to the National People's Congress and Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Luo Peiyuan, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, as well as deputies to the People's Congress of Guangdong and Guangzhou, members of the CPPCC, and directors of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs in Guangzhou, and many others.

    石桥湛山在北京机场发表了如下的谈话：
    “这次我们根据周总理的邀请，来贵国访问。在三年前我组织内阁的时候，曾决定了将日中关系正常化作为外交方针之一。过一时期我病倒了，退辞了总理地位，结果未能实现自己的心愿，就到今天的日子了。幸而病得到了小康，于是我很想贯彻素愿，下决心来贵国进行访问。
    “贵国的发展就是亚洲的发展。我现在能够亲眼看到贵国发展情况，不胜喜庆。我深切感觉：自古以来筑成了伟大文化的六亿中国人民和明治维新以来在亚洲首先建立了工业国家的一亿日本国民，密切合作来维护亚洲和世界的和平，为增进东方人民的幸福进行努力，这就是日中两国的责任，而且是对人类的义务。
    “日本过去两千年间，一向受过中国文化的帮助，对中国人民抱着感激和尊敬之意。到了最近发生了不幸的情形，对中国人民给了严重的损害，我感觉遗憾之至。日本国民也就此进行了深刻反省，我恳求不要责难得太苛刻。
      “我本人愿望两国人民今后真正以和兄弟姊妹一般的感情，继续温暖的交游关系。我这次访问贵国就是为了实现如上心愿。
    “我答应周总理的邀请来贵国访问，但很遗憾的是，能够逗留的时间很短。如果为了日中两国的幸福能够开辟一个端绪的话，我将感到十分幸福。”
