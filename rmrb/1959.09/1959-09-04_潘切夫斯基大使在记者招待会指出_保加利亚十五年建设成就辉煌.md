Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Ambassador Panchevski pointed out at a press conference that Bulgaria's fifteen years of construction have been glorious.

　　September 9th marks the 15th anniversary of Bulgaria's National Day. Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Panchevski, held a press conference this afternoon to introduce to reporters from various news organizations and magazines in the capital the glorious achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction over the past fifteen years.

　　Ambassador Panchevski said: In summarizing the tremendous achievements of the past fifteen years, the Bulgarian people can proudly declare: Bulgaria has been built into a new socialist country in a short historical period. The Ambassador said: Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people are working with greater effort to realize the various great tasks of socialist construction.

　　When describing the construction achievements of the Bulgarian people over the past fifteen years, he emphasized: In the past fifteen years, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people, in fraternal cooperation with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, have realized the economic and cultural transformation of their motherland. The Ambassador said: Over the past fifteen years, Bulgaria has achieved rapid development in national productivity during the process of high-speed industrialization; the country's industrial base has been able to guarantee the further development of the national economy along the socialist road. Now, the socialist transformation of agriculture has been completed, which has created conditions for increasing crop yields and livestock product rates, as well as increasing the income of cooperative members. The Ambassador also detailed to the reporters the inspiring achievements made in Bulgaria's cultural and educational, health, and scientific undertakings.

　　The Ambassador especially mentioned the great leap forward in construction that the Bulgarian people have made since last year. He said: Last year, the Party issued a great call to the entire people to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years; all working people unanimously supported this call and are putting it into practice with great effort. In 1959, factories and agricultural production cooperatives are required to double their output compared to last year.

　　Ambassador Panchevski emphasized: The correct line of our Party, the mass heroism of the people, and the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist fraternal countries are guarantees for the victory of the Bulgarian people's socialist construction. When talking about foreign relations, the Ambassador said: Bulgaria, together with all socialist countries, is fighting to strengthen the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to enhance the unity of socialist countries and all peace-loving people.
