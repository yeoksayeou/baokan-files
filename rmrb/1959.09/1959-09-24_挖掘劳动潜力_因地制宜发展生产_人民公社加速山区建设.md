Tap Labor Potential, Develop Production According to Local Conditions
People's Communes Accelerate Mountain Area Construction

(By our dispatch) The old revolutionary base areas—the mountain areas of Jiangxi Province—have achieved tremendous accomplishments in developing agricultural production and diverse economies over the past year, fully demonstrating the inexhaustible power of the people's communes in constructing mountain areas. According to statistics from forty mountain counties in the Ganzhou, Ji'an, and Shangrao regions, the unit area yield of early rice this year increased by 20% to 30% compared to the bumper harvest of 1958. The development of diverse economies has also been very rapid. Since communization, mountain area communes have afforested over one million mu, and cultivated over ninety thousand mu of forests, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. The number of pigs raised by communes has developed to over one million, along with five million chickens and ducks, and four hundred thousand rabbits, sheep, and dairy cows (heads). Communization has also promoted the development of industry and transportation in mountain areas. Communes have established more than two thousand factories for agricultural implements, machinery, and wild plant processing, with a total output value doubling compared to the same period last year. In terms of transportation, with the help of the state, the masses in mountain areas have built five hundred kilometers of highways and simple roads, renovated over one thousand kilometers of folk transport routes, and dredged thirty-six waterways, changing the inconvenient transportation conditions in mountain areas.

With the rapid development of various productions, people's material and cultural life has improved significantly. The total income of communes in the first half of this year generally increased by about 50% compared to the same period last year. After communization, mountain areas established thousands of primary schools, middle schools, night schools, and red and expert schools, with all school-age children enrolled. Cultural life is even more rich and colorful, with each commune establishing libraries and clubs, and forming amateur theatrical troupes and singing groups. To facilitate the masses' purchase of production and living materials, basically every commune has a purchasing and marketing store, and every team has a peddler. The people in mountain areas enthusiastically praise the people's communes, saying: "A good mother is not as good as the commune, fragrant flowers are not as fragrant as the commune, as long as the people's commune exists, the mountains will surely become paradise."

One of the important reasons for the great development of various production and construction undertakings in the mountain areas of Jiangxi is that the people's communes have solved the difficulty of insufficient labor in realizing the overall Great Leap Forward. Mountain areas, accounting for 60% of the province's total area, have more land and fewer people, resulting in insufficient labor. After the establishment of communes, collective living welfare undertakings were vigorously carried out to liberate women's labor from housework; the semi-able-bodied labor force was rationally organized to participate in production, giving full play to their role in production and improving labor efficiency; at the same time, according to the principle of "small-scale activity during busy farming seasons, large-scale activity during slack farming seasons," various professional teams were formed to comprehensively develop diverse operations.

The power of the commune in developing mountain areas is also manifested in developing various productions in accordance with the characteristics of the mountain areas and the habits of the masses, adapting to local conditions and seasons. For example, deep mountain areas with abundant forests vigorously manage forestry and forest by-product processing; remote mountain areas vigorously produce minor mountain goods and local products; general mountain areas are close to urban industrial and mining areas, with convenient transportation, and vigorously develop economic forests, fruit tree forests, and non-staple food production. For example, the original Chunhu Agricultural Cooperative in Yongxiu County had more than one thousand mu of sandy land, which was not suitable for planting rice, resulting in very low yields of less than two hundred catties per mu. After the establishment of the commune, this part of the land was used to produce local specialties, and the output value per mu increased by more than two times compared to planting rice. Suqu Commune in Wuning County, located in the midst of towering mountains and peaks, has everything: forests, mountain goods, and local products. After the commune was established, it raised 80,000 yuan, transferred more than 3,000 laborers, and established 80 factories, including agricultural tool factories, machinery factories, non-staple food processing factories, fertilizer factories, and paper mills. The development of commune-run industry has not only increased the income of the commune and its members, but also promoted the development of agricultural production. Zhangling Commune in Duchang County has high mountains and cold water, and in the past, each mu of land only yielded two hundred catties of grain. This year, the commune established more than fifty local fertilizer factories, producing more than ten million catties of warm fertilizer, which improved the soil, and the average yield of early rice increased to five hundred catties per mu.

It has only been one year since the realization of people's communization in mountain areas, and it has already fully demonstrated its great role in developing the mountain areas' economy and culture and improving the living standards of the mountain people. Now, the people in mountain areas are holding high the red flag of the people's commune, full of confidence, and struggling to accelerate the construction of prosperous and happy mountain areas!

    挖掘劳动潜力　因地制宜发展生产
    人民公社加速山区建设
    本报讯　革命老根据地——江西山区各人民公社，一年来取得了发展农业生产和多种经济的巨大成就，充分显示了人民公社建设山区的无穷无尽的力量。据赣南、吉安、上饶等专区的四十个山区县统计，今年早稻单位面积产量比大丰收的1958年增加了二成至三成。多种经济发展也非常迅速。公社化后，山区各公社造林一百多万亩，育林九十多万亩，总面积比去年增加了50％以上。各公社生猪已发展到一百多万头，鸡鸭五百万只，兔、羊、奶牛四十万只（头）。公社化还促进了山区工业和交通的发展。各公社建立了农具、机械和野生植物加工等工厂二千多个，总产值比去年同时增加了一倍。在交通方面，在国家的帮助下，山区群众修建了五百公里公路和简易公路，整修了一千多公里民间运输道，疏浚了三十六条河道，改变了山区交通不便的状况。
    随着各项生产的飞跃发展，人民的物质和文化生活有了著显提高。各公社今年上半年总收入一般都比去年同期增加了50％左右。公社化后，山区兴办了上千所小学、中学、夜校和红专学校，学龄儿童全部入了学。文化生活更是丰富多彩，各公社都设立了图书室、俱乐部，成立了业余剧团和歌咏队。为了便利群众购买生产和生活资料，基本上做到了社社有购销店、队队有货郎担。山区人民热情地歌颂人民公社说：“娘好不如公社好，花香哪有公社香，只要人民公社在，山间必定变天堂。”
    江西山区各项生产建设事业大发展的重要原因之一，是由于人民公社解决了实现全面大跃进中劳动力不足的困难。占全省总面积60％的山区，地多人少，劳动力不足。公社成立后，大力举办集体生活福利事业，把妇女劳动力从家务劳动中解放出来；合理地组织整半劳动力参加生产，充分发挥了他们在生产上的作用，提高了劳动效率；同时，根据“农忙小搞，农闲大搞”的原则，组成各种专业队，使多种经营全面开展起来。
    公社开发山区的威力，还表现在根据山区的特点和群众习惯，因时因地制宜地发展各种生产。如深山区森林多，就大力经营林业和林副产品加工；边远山区大力生产小宗的山货土产；一般山区靠近城市工矿区，运输方便，大力发展经济林、果树林和副食品生产。如永修县的原淳湖农业社有一千多亩沙质土地，不宜种水稻，产量很低，每亩收谷不到二百斤。公社成立后，将这部分土地用来生产土特产，每亩地产值比种水稻提高了二倍多。位于丛山峻岭中的武宁县苏区公社，森林、山货、土产样样都有。公社建立起来后，集资八万元，抽调三千多个劳动力，兴办了农具厂、机械厂、副食品加工厂、化肥厂、造纸厂等八十个工厂。社办工业的发展，不仅增加了社和社员的收入，还推动了农业生产的发展。都昌县张岭公社山高水冷，过去每亩田只收谷二百斤，今年公社兴办五十多个土化肥厂，生产了一千多万斤暖性肥料，改良了土壤，早稻平均亩产提高到五百斤。
    山区实现人民公社化刚刚一年，它对发展山区经济和文化，提高山区人民生活水平，已经充分地显示了巨大的作用。现在，山区人民正高举着人民公社的红旗，满怀信心地为加速建设繁荣、幸福的山区而斗争！
