Xinhua News Agency, September 13th – Encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, coal mine workers across the country launched a new upsurge in the coal production campaign in early September, achieving a double harvest in coal mining and tunneling.

The average daily raw coal production of 140 bureaus and mines nationwide exceeded the plan by 7.08% in early September, an increase of 43.03% compared to the average daily production level in early August, 27.78% compared to mid-August, and 13.76% compared to late August. One hundred and nine bureaus greatly exceeded the planned daily production level, including Fuxin, Jiaozuo, Benxi, and Datong Mining Bureaus, exceeding the plan by 10% to 20% or more. In terms of tunneling, according to statistics from forty-two bureaus and mines, the average daily footage in early September increased by 8.98% compared to the same period in August.

In early September, coal mine workers across the country opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted their morale, and continued to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The eighteen effective advanced experiences such as four-shift cross-operation, regular cyclic operation, blasting coal loading, and rapid scraper conveyor movement were promoted in various mining bureaus, which played a significant role in improving production levels.

Xinhua News Agency, September 12th – The Jingxi Mining Bureau in Beijing launched a coal production campaign in September to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Outstanding results have been achieved in early September: raw coal production exceeded the national plan by 5.66%, and the average daily output increased by 16.8% compared to late August.

In order to complete the September production plan ahead of schedule, the bureau's workers made full preparations in advance. All mines in the bureau changed the past situation where production was affected at the beginning of the month due to the takeover of work faces. They also opened eight new mining faces and thoroughly overhauled mechanical equipment, coal carts, and mining tools. The workers held oath-taking rallies and widely carried out competitions between sections, groups, shifts, and individuals. Each mine investigated the problems existing in each work face and took measures to solve them. Muchengjian Mine, the largest mine in the bureau, found that the key to further increasing production was to achieve a certain balance between roadway repair, tunneling, and mining, and to more appropriately strengthen the weak links of repair and tunneling. In early September, it achieved a double harvest in mining and tunneling. Workers at Chengzikuang Mine designated each week as a battle, used coal cutting machines in the mining face, and promoted the advanced experience of "one cut, one shot," enabling both mining and tunneling to exceed the national plan for early September.

    140个局矿上旬原煤超产
    京西矿务局原煤产量超过计划5.66％
    新华社13日讯　全国煤矿职工在八届八中全会决议鼓舞下，9月上旬掀起了夺煤大战新高潮，获得了采煤、掘进双丰收。
    全国一百四十个局矿上旬原煤的平均日产量超过计划7.08％，比8月上旬的平均日产水平提高43.03％，比8月中旬提高27.78％，比8月下旬提高13.76％。上旬日产水平大大超过计划的有一百零九个局，其中阜新、焦作、本溪、大同等矿务局，超过计划10％到20％以上。掘进方面，据四十二个局矿统计，上旬的平均日进尺比8月同期提高8.98％。
    9月上旬，各煤矿职工反右倾，鼓干劲，继续开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。四班交叉作业、正轨循环作业、爆破装煤、快速移溜子等行之有效的十八项先进经验，分别在各矿务局推广，对生产水平的提高起了很大的作用。
    新华社12日讯　北京京西矿务局职工为迎接国庆十周年而开展的9月夺煤大战，在上旬已经取得优异战果：原煤产量超额5.66％完成了国家计划，平均日产量比8月下旬提高16.8％。
    为提前完成9月份生产计划，这个局的职工事先作了充分准备。全局各矿改变了过去月初因接替工作面而影响生产的情况，并且开辟了八个新回采工作面，普遍比较彻底地检修了机械设备、煤车和采掘工具。职工们先后召开了誓师比武大会，广泛开展了段与段、组与组、班与班、人与人之间的竞赛。各矿对每个工作面存在的问题都作了调查，并采取措施解决。全局最大的木城涧矿，找出了进一步增产的关键在于使巷道修理、掘进和回采之间取得一定的平衡，更适当地加强了修理和掘进的薄弱环节，9月上旬获得了回采、掘进双丰收。城子矿职工把每周划定为一个战役，在回采工作面使用割煤机，推广一刀一炮的先进经验，使回采和掘进都超额完成上旬国家计划。
