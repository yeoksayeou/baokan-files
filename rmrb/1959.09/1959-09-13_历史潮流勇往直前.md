The Irresistible Force of Historical Trends Moves Forward Courageously
Shu Nan

Teams of men and women, young and old, holding high red flags and carrying iron shovels, beat drums and gongs as they headed straight for the reservoir construction site. The cheers were like mountains collapsing and the earth cracking. At the sound of a command, the crowd scattered across the vast fields like stars in the night. Here, hand-pushed carts flew along the tracks; there, young men and women raced each other, carrying four loads or six baskets each… These moving scenes from films documenting the earth-shaking, mountain-moving efforts of the water conservancy army in 1958 left an unforgettable impression on me. When I had the opportunity to personally visit the real-life situations reflected in these scenes, I more deeply appreciated the profound significance of the masses advancing courageously towards lofty ideals under the leadership of the Party.

Last May, in Huayuan Township near the Great Wall, I saw that the waterlogged land that had suffered from disasters every year before liberation had been transformed into rice paddies by people's own hands. When the evening glow rippled across the interconnected rice fields, the teams of commune members returning to the village from work along the ridges resembled the rural areas of Jiangnan. I followed behind, listening to them excitedly talk about how, after the floodwaters here were subdued, they were now used to irrigate these newly cultivated rice fields, allowing them to eat the rice they had personally sown and harvested. Following the direction pointed out by the Party, they are transforming their impoverished homeland into a Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall step by step. What else could stop them?

In the autumn, in Siji Township of Chaoxian County, Anhui, which had overcome a hundred-day drought, everything was lush and green. Among the many folk songs circulating locally that praised the Great Leap Forward, I liked the line "Raise the Chao Lake as a Water Ladle" the most. Listen to it, how big is the tone of our people! It is this spirit of bold words that gives us endless strength to overcome all natural disasters and carry out socialist construction.

I once personally witnessed how the masses responded to the Party's call with joy and determination to complete the work ahead of schedule when the news of the General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" reached the countryside and the canal construction site. Because the Party's General Line deeply reflects the wishes of the people of the whole country and meets the requirements of history, the broad masses of the people support the Party, love Chairman Mao, and follow the Party wholeheartedly. It is also because the Party, for the benefit of the masses, resolutely implemented the working method of the mass line, which enabled the people to continuously improve their awareness and realize that they must rise up and fight against all natural disasters. People could then exert their soaring enthusiasm and form an irresistible powerful force.

Could the "petty-bourgeois fanatic movement" make mountains give way and rivers flow backwards? The best proof is the facts. Our water conservancy has not been done badly or chaotically. Just imagine, if the masses had not enthusiastically risen up to engage in water conservancy on a large scale, building tens of thousands of large, medium, and small reservoirs within a year, how could we have overcome this year's water and drought disasters? And how could we have increased this year's grain production by another 10% on the basis of last year's leap forward? You must know that anything that meets the requirements of history, you can't oppose it no matter how hard you try, and even if you artificially block it or cancel it, it's useless. If it does not meet the requirements of history, then it must collapse. From the matter of water conservancy construction, we can also see this truth. The people of the whole country continue to move forward courageously along the road pointed out by the Party. This historical trend cannot be stopped by any force!

    历史潮流勇往直前
    舒楠
    一队队高举红旗、肩荷铁铲的男男女女、老老少少，锣鼓喧天，千军万马直奔水库工地，欢呼声像山崩地裂。一声号令，人群像黑夜的繁星撒在广阔的原野上，这里是一辆辆手推的小斗车在轨道上飞驰而过，那里是年青的小伙子和姑娘们你挑四担他挑六筐地你追我赶……这些纪录了1958年水利大军翻天覆地，移山倒海的影片的感人画面，曾给我留下了难忘的印象。当我有机会亲身跑到这些画面所反映的实际生活中，我才更深地体会到在党的领导下，人民群众朝着远大理想勇往直前的更深刻的意义。
    去年5月，在长城边上的花园乡，我看到解放前年年遭灾的水涝地，已被人们用双手改造成稻田。当晚霞在阡陌相连的水田中摇荡，一队队收了工的社员从田塍上回村去的时候，那情景宛若江南农村。我跟在后边，听他们兴奋地讲着这里的祸水被降服后，如今用来灌溉这些新开辟的稻田，使他们能够吃到自己亲手播种和收割的大米。他们按着党指出的方向，正一步步把自己贫困的家园变成塞外江南，还有什么能阻拦住他们呢？
    秋天，在战胜了百日大旱的安徽巢县司集乡，遍地都是绿油油的。在当地流传的许许多多歌唱大跃进的民歌中，我最欢喜“端起巢湖当水瓢”这一句，你听听，我们的人民好大的口气。就是这种豪言壮语的气概，使我们有无穷的力量战胜一切自然灾害，进行社会主义建设。
    我曾经亲眼看到过党提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的消息传到农村和修水渠的工地时，群众怎样以欢欣鼓舞的情绪和提前完工的决心，来响应党的号召。因为，党的总路线正是深刻地反映了全国人民的愿望，合乎历史要求的东西，广大人民群众才这样拥护党，敬爱毛主席，一心一德地跟着党走。也正是党为了群众的利益，坚决执行了群众路线的工作方法，使人民不断地提高了觉悟，认识到必须自己起来和一切自然灾害进行斗争，人们才能发挥了冲天干劲，组成了一支不可抗拒的强大力量。
    难道“小资产阶级狂热运动”能使高山让路，河水倒流么？事实是最好的证明，我们的水利并不是办糟了、办乱了。试想，如果不是群众轰轰烈烈地起来大搞水利，在一年之内，修建起数以万计的大、中、小型水库，我们怎么能够战胜今年这样的水旱灾害？又怎么能够使今年的粮食在去年跃进的基础上再增产10％？要知道，凡是合乎历史要求的东西，你怎么反对也反对不了，即使人为地加以阻拦，加以取消，都没有用。如果它不合乎历史要求，那就一定要垮。从水利建设这一件事上，也同样能看到这个真理。全国人民沿着党指出的道路，继续勇往直前，这一股历史的潮流，不是任何力量所能阻挡的！
