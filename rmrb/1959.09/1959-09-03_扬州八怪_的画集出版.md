    Painting Collection of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou" Published

    A collection of paintings by the eight most famous painters of Yangzhou during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty has recently been published by the Beijing Cultural Relics Publishing House. These eight painters are Jin Nong, Luo Pin, Wang Shishen, Huang Shen, Gao Xiang, Zheng Xie, Li Shan, and Li Fangying, who were once known as the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou."

    Yangzhou at that time was one of the cities with the most concentrated commercial capital in the country, and painting art was also relatively developed. The "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou" were professional painters with high literary accomplishment and artistic achievement at that time. During the Qianlong period, the painting circles were influenced by the Six Masters of the early Qing Dynasty (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, Wang Yuanqi, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping), forming an "orthodox school" that slavishly imitated the ancients, and regarded the innovative painters who were not bound by this school as "heretical and monstrous." Jin Nong and the other eight painters belonged to the innovative school at that time. They dared to break conventions and develop their own originality, so their paintings all had unique styles.

    The twelve paintings selected in this collection are representative works of the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou." The collection also introduces their artistic achievements and styles to readers in popular language.

    "Plum Tree Scroll" is a work by Jin Nong. The old plum tree he painted with light ink and water occupies the entire length of the painting. The branches of the plum tree are oblique and messy, and the trunk is interspersed with countless sparse flowers and tender stamens, giving people a feeling of the faint fragrance and sparse shadows under the old plum tree. Jin Nong's pseudonym was Dongxin, and he didn't start learning to paint until he was over fifty years old. Gao Xiang also painted in an unconventional style. On a piece of paper, he used simple strokes to draw an eye-catching pomegranate flower. Although it is not accompanied by any side embellishments, it makes people feel that the paper is full of fragrance. This painting method is one example of the "Eight Eccentrics" painters' unwillingness to stick to conventions. The collection also includes representative works by Zheng Xie and the other six artists, each with its own unique charm and characteristics. (Attached image)

### “扬州八怪”的画集出版

    “扬州八怪”的画集出版
    清代乾隆年间，扬州最著名的八个画家的画集，最近由北京文物出版社出版。这八个画家是金农、罗聘、汪士慎、黄慎、高翔、郑燮、李鳝、李方膺，他们曾经被人们称作“扬州八怪”。
    扬州在当时是全国商业资本集中的城市之一，绘画艺术也比较发展。“扬州八怪”就是当时有较高文学素养和艺术成就的职业画家。乾隆年间绘画界受清初六大家（王时敏、王鉴、王翬、王原祁、吴厉、恽寿平）的影响，形成了死摹古人的“正统派”，把不受这一派束缚的革新派画家，认为是“邪魔怪道。”金农等八位画家就是属于当时的革新派，他们敢于打破常规，发挥自己的独创性，所以他们的画都具有独特风格。
    这个画集中所选的十二幅画，是“扬州八怪”一部分代表作。画集中并用通俗的文字向读者介绍了他们的艺术成就和风格。
    “梅树图轴”是金农作品。他用淡墨带水写成的老梅树，占据了画幅的全长，梅树的枝干欹斜厉乱，树身间又穿插无数疏花嫩蕊，使人感觉到老梅花树下那种暗香疏影的风光。金农号冬心，到五十岁以后才开始学画。高翔作画也不拘一格。在一方纸上，他用简笔画出了一支照眼的榴花，虽然不着一点旁衬，但令人觉得芳意满纸。这种画法，是“八怪”的画家不肯墨守成规的例子之一。画集还搜集了郑燮等其他六家的代表作各一幅。也都各有气韵和特色。（附图片）
