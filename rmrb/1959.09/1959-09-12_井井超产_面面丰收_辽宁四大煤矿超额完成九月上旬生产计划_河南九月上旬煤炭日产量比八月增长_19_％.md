Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: The workers of Liaoning Province's four major state-owned coal mines completed their coal production plan for the first ten days of September one day ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 90,000 tons. They further proposed a guarantee: to complete the third quarter plan five days ahead of schedule and increase production by another 700,000 tons of coal as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Inspired by the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of the four major coal mines in Liaoning Province, namely Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, held mobilization and competition rallies, put forward new production increase plans and competition conditions, and beat the drums for a great effort in the key month of September. On the first day of September, all four major coal mines had a good start. Fushun Coal Mine completed 130% of its daily production plan, and by the 8th, it had completed the first ten days of September plan two days ahead of schedule. The workers of Fuxin Coal Mine focused on promoting the advanced experiences of "blasting and coal loading" and "hydraulic transportation," greatly improving production efficiency, and completed the first ten days of September plan one day ahead of schedule, with coal production exceeding that of Fushun Coal Mine by more than 48,000 tons. From September 1st, these four mines have exceeded their production plans every day, reversing the long-standing situation of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and rushed at the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th: Coal mine workers in Henan Province have exceeded the coal production plan for the first ten days of September. The average daily coal output in the province reached more than 75,000 tons, an increase of 19% compared to the average daily output in August. Among them, the seven key provincial-operated coal mines of Jiaozuo, Pingdingshan, Hebi, Yiluo, Guanyintang, Yima, and Xinmi, had an average daily output of nearly 50,000 tons, an increase of 71.8% compared to the same period last year. The raw coal output of small coal mines operated by special districts and counties has also been increasing steadily in the process of continuous technological transformation.

Since September, the workers of coal mines in Henan Province have actively responded to the Party's battle call, opposed right-leaning tendencies, boosted their energy, and deeply launched the movement to increase production and practice economy. Many coal mines have held mobilization meetings and competition rallies, and carried out various forms of socialist labor competitions. The workers of Jiaozuo Coal Mine posted more than 25,000 big-character posters, criticizing the right-leaning ideas of a few people who believed that the coal mine had few old workers, little machinery and equipment, and long transportation roadways in old mines, therefore high production was not possible. Soon, a situation of exceeding production in every mine and overall bumper harvest (in every working face) emerged. The Party Secretary and Director of Hebi Chenjiazhuang Mine and engineers went deep into the mines to direct production, focusing on weak links, and solved some long-standing problems in production such as coal car derailments. Xinmi Coal Mine also held a special meeting for production team leaders, mechanical and electrical team leaders, and scraper conveyor workers to address the issue of frequent scraper conveyor accidents, strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation between coal mining and mechanical and electrical workers, and improving the installation quality of the scraper conveyors. No scraper conveyor accidents occurred in the first ten days of September. In addition, all mines have greatly strengthened the leadership of technological innovation.

    井井超产　面面丰收
    辽宁四大煤矿超额完成九月上旬生产计划
    河南九月上旬煤炭日产量比八月增长19％
    新华社沈阳11日电　辽宁省四大国营煤矿职工提前一天、超额九万吨完成了9月上旬的煤炭生产计划。他们又提出保证：提前五天完成第三季度计划，再增产七十万吨煤，作为向国庆十周年的献礼。
    在党的八届八中全会精神鼓舞下，辽宁省抚顺、阜新、本溪、北票四大煤矿的职工，纷纷召开誓师比武大会，提出新的增产计划和竞赛条件，鼓起大干九月关键月的战鼓。9月头一天，四大煤矿都开门红。抚顺煤矿完成日产计划130％，到8日便提前两天完成上旬计划。阜新煤矿职工重点推广“放炮装煤”、“水力运输”两项先进经验，大大提高生产效率，提前一天完成了上旬计划，煤炭产量比抚顺煤矿还多四万八千多吨。从9月1日开始，这四个矿天天超额完成生产计划，扭转了长期以来月初松、月末紧的局面。
    新华社郑州11日电　河南省煤矿职工超额完成9月上旬产煤计划，全省煤炭平均日产量达到七万五千多吨，比8月份平均日产量增加19％。其中焦作、平顶山、鹤壁、宜洛、观音堂、义马、新密七个省营重点煤矿，平均日产量接近五万吨，比去年同期增长了71.8％。专区和县营的小煤矿，在不断进行技术改造的过程中，原煤产量也步步上升。
    9月份以来，河南省各煤矿的职工积极响应党的战斗号召，反右倾，鼓干劲，深入地开展了增产节约运动。许多煤矿都举行誓师大会和比武大会，开展各种不同形式的社会主义劳动竞赛。焦作煤矿职工贴出了两万五千多张大字报，批判了少数人认为煤矿老工人少、机器设备少、老矿井运输巷道长，因此不能高产的右倾思想，很快出现了井井超产，（工作面）面面丰收的局面。鹤壁陈家庄矿的党委书记、矿长和工程师深入井下指挥生产，抓薄弱环节，解决了煤车掉道等生产中一些长期没有解决的问题。新密煤矿也针对工作面溜子事故多的情况，专门召开了生产组长、机电组长和溜子工的会议，加强了采煤和机电工的互助协作，提高了溜子的安装质量，9月上旬没有发生一次溜子事故。另外，各矿都大大加强了技术革新的领导工作。
