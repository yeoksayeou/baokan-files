Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd - Turin (Italy) Dispatch: The Italian government, hostile to the Chinese people, arbitrarily lowered the Chinese national flag at the venue of the World University Games being held in Turin. The Chinese student sports team has lodged a serious protest with the Italian government. Delegations from various countries participating in the games and the broad masses of the Italian people have also strongly protested this crude act by the Italian government. To express their protest against the Italian government and their support for the Chinese sports team, delegations from various countries participating in the Turin Games lowered their own national flags.
  Before the games, the Italian government had already created obstacles regarding the entry visas for the Chinese student sports team. Due to the Chinese student sports team's justified arguments and protests from international public opinion, the Italian government had no choice but to issue the visas. During the opening ceremony on August 27th, the entire audience stood and cheered enthusiastically as the Chinese student sports team entered the stadium holding the Chinese national flag high. However, on August 29th, the third day after the opening of the World University Games, the Italian government, in violation of international sports principles and the will of the Italian people, arbitrarily lowered the Chinese national flag flying over Turin's train station square and the stadium, citing the absence of diplomatic relations with China. Upon discovering this situation, the Chinese student sports team immediately went to the executive committee of the World University Sports Federation to lodge a strong protest against this act of hostility and insult to the Chinese people by the Italian government.
    The International Supervisory Referee Committee of the World University Games convened a meeting of member countries that evening. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to lower all national flags of participating countries to show support for China.
    After the meeting, representatives from various countries went to Turin's train station square at 2:00 AM on the 30th and lowered their national flags, despite obstruction from the police authorities. The national flags at the various venues of the games were also lowered on the 30th.
    This unreasonable act of hostility towards China by the Italian government has aroused strong resentment among the broad masses of the Italian people and students. Many organizations and individuals from various places have sent telegrams to the Chinese sports team expressing their support. When Chinese athletes appeared in the stadium or on the streets of Turin, many citizens and students warmly expressed their support for the People's Republic of China.
    On September 1st, at a joint reception held by the Turin City People's Sports Association to welcome the student sports teams from various countries, the person in charge of the workers' club pointed out in his speech that the people and workers of Turin supported and sympathized with China in this incident. His speech was met with enthusiastic applause and cheers from the more than 600 young people present. Afterwards, the Italian government attempted to shirk responsibility, stating that the government had not ordered the lowering of the Chinese national flag.
    The Italian newspaper "Unità" published an article on September 1st condemning the Italian government's attempt to obstruct China's participation in the World University Games and the crude act of arbitrarily lowering the Chinese national flag. The article also exposed the Italian government's attempt to evade responsibility, arguing that if the Italian government was indeed not involved in this matter, then the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China should be allowed to fly again over the venue of the World University Games. Currently, the World University Games are continuing.

    在都灵举行的世界大学生运动会上
    意当局降下我国旗激起公愤  各国代表队自动降下国旗以示抗议
    新华社布拉格3日电　都灵（意大利）消息：意大利政府敌视中国人民，擅自降下在都灵举行的世界大学生运动会会场上的中国国旗。中国学生体育队已向意大利政府提出严重抗议。参加运动会的各国代表队和意大利广大人民群众也纷纷强烈抗议意大利政府的这种粗暴行为。为了表示对意大利政府的抗议和对中国体育队的支持，参加都灵运动会的各国代表队都降下了自己的国旗。
  意大利政府在这次运动会前就在中国学生体育队入境签证问题上横加阻挠。由于中国学生体育队的据理力争和各国舆论的抗议，意大利政府才不得不发给签证。8月27日运动会开幕式上，中国学生体育队高举中国国旗入场时全场起立热烈欢呼。但在8月29日，世界大学生运动会开幕后的第三天，意大利政府竟违背国际体育运动原则和意大利人民的意志，借口和中国没有外交关系，擅自把飘扬在都灵车站广场和运动场上的中国国旗降下。中国学生体育队发现这一情况后，立即到世界大学生体育运动会执行委员会对意大利政府这种敌视和侮辱中国人民的行为，提出强硬抗议。
    世界大学生运动会国际监察裁判委员会当天晚上就召开了成员国会议。会上一致地通过了一项决议：把参加运动会的所有国家的国旗全部降下来，以表示对中国的支持。
    会议结束后，各国代表在30日清晨二时前往都灵车站广场，不顾警察当局的阻挠，降下了各国国旗。运动会各场地上的各国国旗也在30日降了下来。
    意大利政府的这种敌视中国的无理行为，已经在意大利广大人民和学生中引起强烈的反感。各地许多组织和个人纷纷致电中国体育队表示支持。当中国运动员在运动场或都灵街头出现时，许多市民和学生都热情地向他们表示对中华人民共和国的支持。
    9月1日，在都灵市人民体育协会举行的欢迎各国学生体育队的联欢晚会上，工人俱乐部的负责人在讲话中热情地指出，都灵市人民和工人在这次事件中是支持和同情中国的。他的讲话获得了到会的六百多青年的热烈鼓掌和欢呼。事后意大利政府又企图推卸责任，声明说政府并未下令降下中国国旗。
    意大利“团结报”9月1日发表了文章，谴责意大利政府阻挠中国参加世界大学生运动会的企图和擅自降下中国国旗的粗暴行为。文章还揭露了意大利政府推卸责任的企图。认为如果意大利政府确与此事无关，那么，就应该让中华人民共和国的五星红旗重新在世界大学生运动会的会场上空飘扬。目前，世界大学生运动会正在继续进行中。
