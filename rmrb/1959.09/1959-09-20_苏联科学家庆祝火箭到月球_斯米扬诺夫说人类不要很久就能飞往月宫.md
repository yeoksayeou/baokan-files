Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: To celebrate the successful arrival of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket on the moon, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, and Moscow University held a grand celebration meeting in the auditorium of Moscow University on the evening of the 18th.

　　Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, announced in his opening speech that today, human flight to the moon and other nearby planets is no longer a mere wish. People are already convinced that it will be achievable in the near future. He said that the realization of this event will not need to wait for the distant future of the twenty-first or twenty-second century, and many of those present today will witness it with their own eyes.

　　He then said that although the scientific investigation results of this cosmic rocket's flight to the moon have not yet been finalized, it is undoubtedly expected that it will make extremely important contributions to helping humanity understand outer space and the physical characteristics of the moon.

　　Academician Sedov said that the information obtained near the moon has provided science with several new discoveries, some of which are of great significance for solving the origin of the moon and the earth. These findings will be announced soon and will become the scientific wealth of all mankind.

　　Sedov said: After this rocket took off, we knew that success was guaranteed. When it was flying towards the moon, we were completely confident of victory. The control of this flight, the determination of the orbit, and the transmission of scientific information were all carried out using specialized, state-of-the-art radio technology and telemetry systems.

　　Academician Kotelnikov, an expert in radio electronics, said at the meeting that now, preparations should be made for flights to Mars and Venus. Now, radio signals can reach the moon and even further. When talking about the new and arduous tasks facing radio workers in future space flights, he said that the power of the radio transmitters carried on rockets now is tens of thousands of times smaller than the power of ordinary radio stations. The power of the transmitters needed for rockets flying to Venus and Mars needs to be greatly reduced (because its energy needs to be guaranteed for several months of use), but at the same time, the communication capabilities of these transmitters must be increased by almost a thousand times.

　　Kotelnikov continued that the primary task at present is to solve the problem of the safe landing of scientific instruments on the moon. Without direct human control, radio instruments must help solve the problem of the first batch of rockets landing on the moon. The scientist is confident that it will not be long before people will gather here again to celebrate newer victories in space flight.

　　Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory in the Soviet Union, pointed out at the meeting that astronomy is transforming from a purely observational science into an experimental science. He said that soon, instruments for astronomical observation will appear in the devices of cosmic rockets. These instruments will obtain astronomical data that is impossible to obtain on Earth.

    苏联科学家庆祝火箭到月球
    ?斯米扬诺夫说人类不要很久就能飞往月宫
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：为庆祝苏联第二个宇宙火箭成功地到达月球，苏联科学院、苏联政治和科学知识普及协会和莫斯科大学，18日晚在莫斯科大学礼堂举行盛大的庆祝大会。
    苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫在致开幕词时宣布，今天，人类飞往月球和附近其他星球已经不是单纯的愿望，人们已经确信，在不久的将来它将是可以实现的事情了。他说，实现这种事不需要等到二十一、二十二世纪那样遥远的未来，今天到会的许多人都将会亲眼看到。
    他接着说，虽然关于这次宇宙火箭飞到月球的科学考察结果还没有最后整理完毕，但是，毫无疑问，可以期待它将在帮助人类了解宇宙空间和月球物理特点方面，作出极其重要的贡献。
    谢道夫院士说，在月亮附近所获得的情报，为科学提供了若干新的发现，其中有的情报对解决月球和地球的起源问题具有重要意义。这些发现不久将加以公布，它们会成为全人类的科学财富。
    谢道夫说：这次火箭起飞之后，我们就知道，成功是肯定有保证的，当它在飞向月球的过程中，我们对胜利是完全充满信心的。这次飞行的操纵、轨道的确定和科学情报的传达，都是采用专门的、最新式的无线电技术和遥测系统进行的。
    无线电电子学专家科捷尔尼科夫院士在会上说，现在，应当准备作到达火星和金星的飞行了。现在，无线电讯号可以达到月球，而且还可以更远一些。他在谈到今后无线电工作者在宇宙飞行中所面临的新的艰巨任务时说，现在火箭上所带的无线电发射机的功率比一般广播电台的功率要小几万倍，飞往金星、火星的火箭所需要的发射机的功率还要大大减低（因为它的能源需要保证使用几个月），但同时却要使这些发射机的通讯能力增加几乎一千倍。
    科捷尔尼科夫接着说，当前的首要的任务是解决科学仪器在月球安全着陆的问题，而在没有人直接参加控制的情况下，必须由无线电仪器来帮助解决第一批火箭在月球着陆的问题。这位科学家确信，不需要再过很长的时间，人们将要在这里再次举行集会，庆祝在宇宙飞行方面的更新的胜利。
    苏联普尔科沃天文台台长米哈伊洛夫在会上指出，天文学正在从一门纯粹观测的科学变成一门实验科学。他说，不久，在宇宙火箭的装置中，将出现用于天文观测的仪器。这些仪器将获得在地球上所不可能获得的天文资料。
