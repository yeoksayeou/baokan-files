Pruning Suckers, Removing Terminal Buds, and Loosening Soil for Autumn Sunning
    Diaoshui Management Area Vigorously Grasps Cotton Field Management

    (Our report) The Diaoshui Management Area of Anping People's Commune in Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, in order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year, thoroughly criticized Right-leaning slackness and conservative thinking among cadres and the masses, continued to summon greater revolutionary zeal, and launched a vigorous cotton production increase movement.

    This management area, from the beginning of spring plowing, correctly implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. The cotton plants generally grew strong with lush leaves, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. Therefore, some production teams neglected the later-stage field management of cotton, resulting in Right-leaning slackness. For example, some people said: "The harvest is pre-determined, good is good, bad is bad, and it's useless to put more effort into the third-class seedlings." Others believed that: "This year's harvest is good, the rainfall is good, and there is no major problem with the harvest," and so on. The facts are the opposite. The recent heavy rains caused a lot of pre-flowering buds to fall off. If active measures are not taken, production will inevitably be reduced. After the Party general branch of the management area discovered these erroneous ideas and slack attitudes, they promptly criticized the blind optimism and Right-leaning slackness. Through debate and detailed accounting, everyone understood that it is necessary to muster energy, strengthen later-stage management, and cotton production increase will be guaranteed. After the Party general branch of the management area put forward the cotton production increase targets, the broad masses of commune members immediately took action. Their specific methods are: first, to prune suckers and remove terminal buds; second, to drain water and prevent waterlogging, to ensure that pre-flowering buds do not fall off; third, to regularly loosen the soil for autumn sunning, and strive to pick all the cotton before the frost.

    打疯杈　去围尖　放秋垅
    吊水管理区狠抓棉田管理
    本报讯　辽宁省辽阳市安平人民公社吊水管理区，为了争取今年棉花大丰收，在干部和群众中彻底批判了右倾松劲情绪和保守思想，继续鼓足更大的革命干劲，又掀起了轰轰烈烈的棉花增产运动。
    这个管理区，从春耕开始就正确地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，棉花普遍长得棵壮叶茂，呈现一片丰收景象。因此有些生产队忽视了对棉花的后期田间管理，产生了右倾松劲情绪。如有的人说：“年成算定了，好就算好，坏就算坏了，对三类苗再下功夫，也白搭”。也有人认为：今年年成好，雨水调和，丰收没大问题等等。事实正相反，最近的几场大雨，棉花伏蕾脱落很多，如不积极采取措施，势必减产。管理区党总支发现这些错误思想和松劲情绪以后，及时批判了盲目乐观和右倾松劲情绪。通过辩论和算细账，大伙明白了必须鼓足干劲，加强后期管理，棉花增产才能有保证。管理区党总支提出了棉花增产指标以后，广大社员们立即行动起来。他们的具体办法是：第一、要打好疯杈、和围尖；第二、排水防涝，保证伏期蕾苓不掉；第三、定时做好放秋垅，争取全拣霜前花。
