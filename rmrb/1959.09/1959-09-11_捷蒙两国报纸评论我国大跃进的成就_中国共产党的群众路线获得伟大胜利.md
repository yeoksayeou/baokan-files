Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 9th. "Slovak Truth" published an article by Jan Janos on September 5th, analyzing the main reasons for the great achievements made by the Chinese people after liberation.

The author wrote that the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is an unforgettable period in China's thousands of years of history. Many people find it hard to imagine that China would become a true world power in ten years, shaking off the backwardness brought about by feudal and imperialist rule for many years at an unparalleled speed in the world, catching up with and surpassing developed capitalist countries in terms of industrial and agricultural output, and carrying out a cultural and technological revolution today.

The author then analyzed the reasons why the Chinese Communist Party enjoys great prestige among the masses and why the Chinese people have achieved great achievements under the leadership of the Party. He reviewed the economic and political situation in old China, pointing out that the class contradictions in old China were relatively obvious, and millions of peasants were exploited by landlords. They launched traditional peasant wars and, together with the proletariat, became a powerful revolutionary class, and realized that the proletariat was their leader.

The article continued, the basic characteristic of the Chinese Communist Party and the root of its victory is to closely link with the masses of the people and unite them around the Party. The article mentioned the land reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and the recent mass movement of Great Leap Forward in steel production. The author said that in addition to correctly explaining the Party's measures in these movements, the Party members' exemplary behavior, self-sacrificing attitude, and heroism in each movement also played a great role. The Party sent thousands of Party members to the grassroots level.

The article said that the reasons why the Chinese people have achieved achievements and victories under the leadership of the Communist Party are because of the implementation and development of the "mass line" in the past and present.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 9th. The Mongolian "Labor Daily" published a commentary entitled "The Great Upsurge of the Chinese People's Leap Forward" on the 7th. The full text is as follows:

Not long ago, the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Eighth Plenary Session, which summarized the situation of the Chinese people's leap forward and pointed out the direction of future work.

On the basis of the leap forward in 1958, the People's Republic of China achieved great victories in all sectors of the national economy in the first half of 1959.

The plenary session pointed out: "The victories of last year and this year fully prove that the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is completely correct." The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that "the central task of the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country at present is to carry out a vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy in order to complete and overfulfill the production and construction plan for 1959."

In the first half of this year, China's total industrial output value increased by 65% compared with the same period in 1958, pig iron production reached 9.5 million tons, coal production reached 174.4 million tons, and metal-cutting machine tools reached 45,000 units, all of which were more than double that of the same period last year; steel production (excluding indigenous steel) reached 5.3 million tons, an increase of 66% compared with the same period last year, cotton yarn reached 4.147 million pieces, sugar reached 780,000 tons, and railway freight volume reached 247 million tons, an increase of 49% compared with the same period last year. While industrial products increased, the quality has also been greatly improved.

This year, China encountered water and drought disasters, but the average yield per unit area of wheat and rice has been greatly improved compared with last year.

While China has made such achievements in the development of agriculture, under the leadership of the Communist Party and leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have overcome certain tendencies of excessive concentration, egalitarianism, and waste that arose in the initial stage of the people's communes, and have quickly embarked on a healthy, solid, and correct path.

In the first half of 1959, the total retail sales of commodities reached 29.6 billion yuan, an increase of 23% compared with the same period in 1958. Among them, the sales volume of grain increased by 12% compared with the same period last year, and the retail sales volume of other consumer goods such as vegetables, cigarettes, and cotton cloth also increased.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that, according to the current specific conditions of the People's Republic of China, it is necessary to make appropriate adjustments to the national economic plan for 1959. Among them: the steel output, excluding indigenous steel, is set at 12 million tons, an increase of 50% compared with last year, the coal output is set at 335 million tons, and the grain output is increased by 10% compared with last year.

Due to the great leap forward of the working class and all laboring people of the People's Republic of China in 1958, they have completed the targets of raw coal, timber, crude salt, and grain in the Second Five-Year Plan four years ahead of schedule, and will complete or approach the targets of steel, metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, metal-cutting machine tools, machine-made paper, cotton and other major industrial production indicators three years ahead of schedule.

Such a leap forward will enable the People's Republic of China to realize the slogan of "catching up with the level of Britain in the output of major industrial products in about ten years" counting from 1958, and it is possible to greatly advance and overfulfill the National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) of the People's Republic of China.

The following conclusion made by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is completely correct: "The general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune are the manifestation of the great determination and great wisdom of our country's 650 million hard-working and brave people, and are the product of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of our Party and the people of all ethnic groups in our country, creatively combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of China."

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China gave specific instructions on launching a movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the country.

Carrying out a comprehensive movement to increase production and practice economy in industry, agriculture, and transportation, and launching a socialist labor competition, is the most glorious task of the working class, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of this country.

The plenary session pointed out that all major industrial sectors must complete and overfulfill monthly and ten-day plans in terms of quality, quantity, and variety, and also pointed out the tasks that need to be completed by rationally arranging domestic labor, agriculture, transportation, and commerce sectors, and the measures to increase production and practice economy.

There is no doubt that the hardworking Chinese people will greet the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with brilliant achievements in fulfilling and realizing the resolutions and instructions of the Communist Party as scheduled and ahead of schedule.

    捷蒙两国报纸评论我国大跃进的成就
    中国共产党的群众路线获得伟大胜利
    新华社布拉格9日电  “斯洛伐克真理报”9月5日登载了扬·扬诺斯的一篇分析中国人民解放以后取得巨大成就的主要原因的文章。
    作者写道，中华人民共和国成立的十周年是中国几千年的历史上不能忘怀的一个时期。许多人都难以想像中国会在十年里成为一个真正的世界强国，它正以世界上无比的速度摆脱多少年来由于封建和帝国主义的统治带来的落后状态，正在工农业产量方面赶上和超过发达的资本主义国家，并在今天实行文化和技术革命。
    作者接着分析了中国共产党在群众中享有巨大威信以及中国人民在党的领导下取得巨大成就的原因。他回顾了旧中国的经济和政治情况，指出旧中国的阶级矛盾是比较明显的，千百万农民群众被地主榨取得一干二净，他们曾发动传统的农民战争，他们同无产阶级在一起，成为一个强大的革命阶级，并且认识到无产阶级是他们的领导。
    文章接着说，中国共产党的基本特点及其取得胜利的根源是，密切联系人民群众并把他们团结在党的周围。文章提到土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动和最近的大炼钢铁群众运动。作者说，党在这些运动中除了正确地解释党的措施之外，党员在每次运动中的以身作则，自我牺牲的态度和英雄气概也起了很大的作用。党把成千上万的党员下放到基层。
    文章说，中国人民在共产党的领导下取得成就和胜利的原因在过去和现在都是因为执行和发展了“群众路线”。
    新华社乌兰巴托9日电　蒙古“劳动报”7日发表了题为“中国人民跃进的巨大高涨”的评论，全文如下：
    不久前，中国共产党第八届中央委员会召开第八次全体会议，总结了中国人民跃进情况，指明了今后的工作方向。
    中华人民共和国在1958年跃进的基础上，1959年上半年国民经济各部门又获得了巨大胜利。
    全会指出：“去年和今年的胜利充分证明，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线是完全正确的。”中国共产党第八届中央委员会第八次全体会议认为：“目前全党和全国各族人民的中心任务，就是要深入开展轰轰烈烈的厉行增产节约的群众运动，为完成和超额完成1959年的生产和建设计划而斗争。”
    今年上半年，中国工业总产值比1958年同期增长65％，生铁产量达到九百五十万吨，煤产量达到一亿七千四百万吨，金属切削机床达到四万五千台，都比去年同期增长一倍以上；钢产量（不包括土钢）达到五百三十万吨，比去年同期增长66％，棉纱达到四百一十四万七千件，糖达到七十八万吨，铁路货运量达到二亿四千七百万吨，比去年同期增长49％。在工业产品增加的同时，质量也有了大大提高。
    今年，中国遇到了水旱灾害，但是，小麦、稻子的平均单位面积产量都比去年有很大提高。
    中国在发展农业方面取得如此成就的同时，中国人民在共产党和领袖毛泽东的领导下，克服了人民公社初办时产生的某些集中过多的倾向，某些平均主义的倾向以及某些浪费现象，迅速地走上了健全的、巩固的正确道路。
    1959年上半年，商品零售总额达到二百九十六亿元，比1958年同期增长23％，其中粮食销售量比去年同期增长12％，其他如蔬菜、烟卷、棉布等消费品零售量也有所增长。
    中国共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议认为，根据中华人民共和国的目前具体情况，有必要对1959年的国民经济计划进行适当的调整。其中：把不包括土钢的钢产量订为一千二百万吨，比去年增长50％，煤的产量订为三亿三千五百万吨，粮食产量比去年增长10％。
    由于中华人民共和国工人阶级及全体劳动人民在1958年的大跃进，已经提前四年完成了第二个五年计划中的原煤、原木、原盐、粮食的指标，又将在钢、冶金设备、发电设备、金属切削机床、机制纸、棉花等主要工业生产指标方面提前三年完成或者接近完成第二个五年计划的指标。
    这样的跃进将使中华人民共和国有可能在从1958年算起的十年左右的时间内实现“十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的口号，并且有可能大大提前超额完成中华人民共和国十二年（1956—1967年）农业发展纲要。
    中国共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议作出的下列结论是完全正确的：“总路线、大跃进、人民公社，这是我国勤劳勇敢的六亿五千万人民的伟大决心和伟大智慧的表现，是我们党和我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际结合起来的产物。”
    中国共产党中央委员会第八次全体会议在全国开展增产节约运动方面作了具体指示。
    在工业、农业和交通运输业全面厉行增产节约，掀起社会主义劳动竞赛，是这个国家的工人阶级、农民及革命知识分子的最光荣的任务。
    全会指出，各主要工业部门必须按质、按量、按品种完成和超额完成每月每旬的计划，同时还指出了合理安排国内劳动力，农业、交通运输业及商业部门需要完成的任务和厉行增产节约的措施。
    勤劳的中国人民将以如期实现和提前实现共产党的决议指示的辉煌成果来迎接中华人民共和国成立十周年，这是毫无疑问的。
