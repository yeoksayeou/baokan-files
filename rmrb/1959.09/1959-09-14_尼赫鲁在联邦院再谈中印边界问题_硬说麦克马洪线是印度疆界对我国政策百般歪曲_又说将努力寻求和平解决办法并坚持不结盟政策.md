Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: According to Indian news sources, Indian Prime Minister Nehru addressed the Council of States on September 10th regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's reply letter of September 8th concerning the Sino-Indian border issue. He believed that this event, occurring two days prior, "further increased the seriousness of the situation." He stated, "China's policy on this issue has gradually, step by step, become more rigid."

Prime Minister Nehru recounted his 1956 conversation with Premier Zhou Enlai regarding the Sino-Indian border issue. He said: "My memory may be incorrect, and his memory may also be incorrect. In any case, I don't happen to rely on my memory, but rather on the record of the conversation I made in formal notes within twenty-four hours after our meeting. These conversations have rarely been quoted." Nehru said that Premier Zhou said, "Due to our friendly relations, as far as the Sino-Indian border is concerned, we will accept the McMahon Line." This was the entire McMahon Line. He then spoke about one or two other things. One was that he did not consider it an effective line. He definitely said that; the British had continuously expanded, but we will recognize it because it has been used for a long time and because we are friendly countries. After hearing him say this, I wanted to make sure I had not misunderstood him. So I think I went back to the question in various ways three times and had him repeat it. Therefore, there is no doubt about this. Because this issue had some importance to me, I wrote it down shortly after leaving, and it is there. Now, this matter is being ignored – if not denied, it is in any case practically denied – and another line has been adopted, which I regret. Of course, things that happened in China might have forced a change in policy, I don't know. That kind of situation can happen in any country, but whatever the reason may be, that's the way it is. This shift did not happen suddenly. Even within this White Paper, readers will see that the reply regarding this McMahon Line, etc... the tone is not as strong and assertive as in Premier Zhou's letter yesterday. China's policy on this issue has gradually, step by step, become more rigid. Why? I can't say.

"Undoubtedly, this issue is a matter of concern to us, not only because of its consequences but also because this development has created a sense of distrust in each other's words and assurances. As some respectable members have said, this is a more important issue than a few yards of territory. If there is that lack of trust and lack of confidence, then what are we going to do?"

Nehru also talked about the circumstances of the 1954 Sino-Indian negotiations to sign the agreement on trade and traffic between the Tibet region of China and India. He said, "Under normal circumstances, one would think that if there was a question of a small part of Tibet being in India or a small part of India being in Tibet when we were dealing with the India-Tibet issue, then these issues should have been brought up for discussion. But these questions were not brought up. I don't see why I should have raised these questions, because I had nothing to say on these questions. I accepted the status quo of the border and did not raise anything. The whole context of this discussion is that we were dealing with all the remaining issues between Tibet and India in that treaty signed with China. To keep hidden in one's heart the idea of changing the entire boundary between Tibet and India and only bring it up later does not seem very straightforward or fair."

Nehru said, "I venture to say that, in my view, China lacks an understanding, or rather a recognition, of the Indian revolution, and that perhaps some of their misunderstandings, as well as many of their approaches to India and matters related to India, stem from this." He further said, "I hope that we have tried to understand them, to understand what is happening there. Perhaps we have not succeeded completely, but I think we have succeeded to a great extent because we have made such a significant attempt anyway. And whether the other party has even made such an attempt, I cannot be certain at all. I feel that, just as in the entire nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century (not now) some Western countries were proud and arrogant, disregarding other countries in the world – they considered themselves the leaders of the world, and other countries in the world should follow them – there is now a tendency in some Far Eastern countries to forget that there are other countries in the world that cannot be ignored. They forget that India is not a country that can be ignored, although it may speak in a gentler tone, as it has been accustomed to doing not only recently but even in past years."

Nehru said, "I greatly admire the logic, rationality, and considerable composure of the Chinese mind. But I sometimes suspect that some of all these original qualities have disappeared. Therefore, we must be cautious. We must certainly be vigilant and must take the measures we can take to safeguard our integrity." He said, "We must take a firm stance, we must stand our ground." But, he also said, "I will always strive for a peaceful resolution because I want to consider the future. If a state of hostility continues between India and China for a long time in the future, the future will be bleak."

Nehru said, "Of course, there is no objective reason for war, no practical reason, no obvious reason, no reason at all. No matter how you deal with it, for us to fight over this issue would be extremely foolish. ... When this conflict occurred, something happened that disturbed our inner beliefs, something happened that hurt our pride, our national pride, our self-esteem, etc. ... It is not for a piece of territory, but because they felt that they were not treated fairly on this issue, that they were treated rather casually by the Chinese government, and an attempt was made to intimidate – if I may use that word – them."

Nehru reiterated that the "McMahon Line" is the boundary of India. He said, "From the first few months of independence, in the first year or two, I have repeatedly said in Parliament that the McMahon Line is our boundary. When I spoke in Parliament, that was speaking to the outside world, if I may say so, that was speaking to the Chinese government." He also said, "We have suggested to them (China) – there is no other way – that we must accept the status quo, and let us discuss these individual places. I don't know, nor do I understand, how we can discuss such a vast area. We can discuss those individual places where there may be some disputes and may have caused dissatisfaction. It is one thing to accept or abide by the McMahon Line, but it is quite another to specifically delineate the line here and there."

Nehru disagreed with the idea that the aggression of British imperialism in the past was the fundamental cause of the Sino-Indian border dispute. He said: "Now we also often use, and they often use – but this word is especially loved by the Chinese authorities – is 'imperialism'. True, there is imperialism in the world. We have a full understanding of it and abhor it extremely. We have been fighting against it. But it seems to me that sometimes this word is used to cover up every sin and everything, as if it were the explanation for every argument. As long as you say 'imperialism', everything is answered." He said, "It is indeed a strange argument to raise these issues now, on the grounds that British imperialism was at work there many, many years ago."

Nehru said, "China is a huge, very large, immense country today. Did this China emerge from the mind of 'Brahma' (the Hindu creator – editor's note) just like that? How did it become so large, so huge? Surely, it was by the ability of its people and the conquests of its warriors over the past many generations, in other words, by Chinese imperialism."

Nehru disagreed with explaining the situation of the Sino-Indian border from the modern history of recent decades. He said, "Where do you draw the line in history? History is full of opportunities, full of ups and downs, full of all sorts of things, full of the integration of nations and countries. If you go back like that, there is no country in the world today that cannot be fundamentally shaken and divided." He said, "It is strange that China does not seem to acknowledge these simple elements of human nature, and ultimately does not attach much importance to friendship with India."

When talking about the Sino-Indian border situation, Nehru said, "All these border issues can be divided into three parts. One part, generally speaking, is the so-called McMahon Line from the Burmese border to the Bhutanese border; the second is Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Lahaul, and Spiti; and then there is Ladakh. You must treat these places separately. ... We have always considered the Ladakh area to be a different area, and in terms of the border, a more ambiguous – if I may say so – area, because the exact border line is simply not clear, unlike the McMahon Line. When we discovered in 1958, more than a year ago, that China was building a road across Yecheng in the northeast corner of Ladakh, we were concerned. We did not know where this road was located ... We were a hundred miles away from that area. This is an uninhabitable area and has never been under any jurisdiction."

Regarding the issue of Indian troops intruding into Chinese territory raised by China, Nehru said, "What is aggression and what is not aggression, of course, depends on where you draw the dividing line." Talking about Longju, where the firefight specifically occurred, he said, "We have one version from our people, and undoubtedly, they have one version from their people. The two versions are different, they contradict each other."

When talking about the map issue, he said: "On the one hand, we have received maps on which large areas of Indian land are marked as if they belong to China; on the other hand, they say that the maps are not accurate, and if necessary, we can change them, but we do not recognize the McMahon Line. No one can know exactly what they think about where that line is drawn. It is very peculiar for a large country to take such a position. Even if we agree to that, it means leaving the issue in a state of ambiguity, and the possibility of trouble always exists."

He also specifically mentioned the Sino-Burmese border issue. He said that he suggested that Premier Zhou Enlai and U Nu hold talks on the border issue. He said, "But I regret to say that although it has been quite some time ago – three and a half years – these talks have not produced results in Burma. The problem remains. Some people in Burma feel that the guarantees given to U Nu regarding the border have not been fulfilled by China."

Nehru talked about the Tibetan rebellion and India's policy towards the Dalai Lama, saying, "Undoubtedly, they (China) encountered difficulties there; of course, the Tibetan people encountered much greater difficulties. Perhaps their reaction to what we did was very strong, I am referring to our granting asylum to the Dalai Lama and certain other factors. We have always tried to take a middle path. We respect the Dalai Lama. Many, many people respect him. This does not mean that we agree with him on everything. In some respects, what he is doing today is wrong. As far as the advice we have given is concerned, we have tried our best to tell him that what he is doing now is wrong. If he takes the Tibet issue to the United Nations, it will not be beneficial." Nehru said, "I must say that he has largely accepted our advice, that is to say, the advice about not being enthusiastic about political disputes. But sometimes he has not accepted it, and this is a difficult issue for us to decide. We do not want to interfere in his affairs, we hope to allow him a limited freedom of action. But undoubtedly, all this must have affected, and is still affecting, the mood in China; perhaps it is because of this, rather than because of logic or reason in China's attitude towards India, towards our border, that they have adopted a rigid attitude."

Nehru said when talking about Sino-Indian friendship: "I think we were right to strive for their friendship, and I can say again: we will continue to strive for their friendship. Anyone who bears the slightest responsibility for India's present and future must not allow themselves to be frightened and angered, and must not act under the control of fright and anger."

When talking about India's foreign policy, Nehru said, "I don't understand what the current situation, which has become serious, has to do with our foreign policy undergoing a so-called severe test. As far as I am concerned, as far as our government is concerned, our foreign policy is as firm as a rock, and it will continue to be so. Some other government may change it. The current government will not change it; the current government will adhere to the non-aligned policy, because it is a matter of principle, not a means of expediency or temporary convenience."

### 尼赫鲁在联邦院再谈中印边界问题  硬说麦克马洪线是印度疆界对我国政策百般歪曲  又说将努力寻求和平解决办法并坚持不结盟政策

    尼赫鲁在联邦院再谈中印边界问题
    硬说麦克马洪线是印度疆界对我国政策百般歪曲
    又说将努力寻求和平解决办法并坚持不结盟政策
    新华社13日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁9月10日在联邦院谈到了周恩来总理就中印边界问题在9月8日写给他的复信。他认为，两天前发生的这件事情“更增加了局势的严重性”。他说，“中国关于这个问题的政策，逐渐地、一步一步地变得更加刻板了。”
    尼赫鲁总理追溯了1956年同周恩来总理的关于中印边境问题的谈话。他说：“我的记忆可能不对，他的记忆也可能不对。不管怎样吧，恰巧我并不信赖我的记忆力，而是信赖在我们会谈后二十四小时之内我在正式笔记上所作的谈话记录。这些谈话几乎很少被引用过。”尼赫鲁说，周总理说，“由于我们的友好关系，就中印边界而论，我们将接受麦克马洪线。”这就是整个麦克马洪线了。他接着还谈到了一两件事。一件是，他并不认为这是有效的一条线。他肯定是这样说的；英国人曾经不断地扩张，然而我们将承认它，因为曾长期沿用过，也因为我们是友好国家。我听他这样说以后，想明确肯定我并未误解他的说法。所以我想我曾用各种方式三度回头再谈这个问题，并使他重复这一点。因此关于这一点是毫无疑问的。由于这个问题对我具有某种重要意义，我在随后不久离开时，就把这个问题记下来，它在那里。现在，这件事被无视——如果不是被否认的话，无论如何，它实际上是被否认了——而且采用了另外一条线，这是我感到遗憾的事。当然，可能中国国内发生的事情迫使改变政策，我不知道。那种情况在任何国家都可能发生，但是，不管原因可能是什么，情况就是这样。发生了这种转变，它并不是突然的。即使在这本白皮书内，读它的人将会看到，关于这条麦克马洪线等等的答复……语气并不像周总理昨天的信那样强硬和武断。中国对这个问题的政策已经逐渐地、一步一步地变得更加刻板了。为什么？我说不上。
    “毫无疑问，这个问题是我们所关切的问题，这不仅是由于它的后果，而且是由于这种事态发展产生了对彼此的话语和保证的不信任感。正如一些可尊敬的议员们所说的，这是比几码领土更为重要的问题。假如存在那种缺乏信任和缺乏信心的情况，那我们怎么样呢？”
    尼赫鲁还谈到1954年中印谈判签订关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的情形。他说，“在通常情况下，人们会认为，如果当我们正在处理印度—西藏问题时，存在着西藏的一小部分在印度或者印度的一小部分在西藏的问题，那么这些问题本应该提出来讨论。可是这些问题没有提出来。我看不出为什么我应该提出这些问题，因为我在这些问题上没有什么话要说。我接受了边界的现状，没有提起任何东西。这种讨论的整个脉络是，我们是在处理同中国签订的那个条约中西藏和印度之间的一切遗留下来的问题。把打算要改变西藏和印度之间的整个边界的想法藏在心底里不说，到后来才把它提出来，这种作法似乎不是很直率或公平的。”
    尼赫鲁说：“我敢冒昧地说，据我看来，中国对印度的革命缺乏了解，或者说缺乏认识，不仅他们的一些误解，还有他们对印度以及与印度有关的事情的许多做法，或许就是由于这一点造成的。”他又说：“我希望，我们是曾设法了解他们，了解在那里发生的事情的。也许我们并没有完全成功，但是我认为，我们在很大程度上是成功的，因为无论如何我们曾经作过这样重大的尝试。而对方甚至连这样的尝试是否作过，我丝毫都不能肯定。我觉得，就像在整个十九世纪和二十世纪的前半叶（不是现在）某些西方国家骄傲狂妄、不把世界其他国家放在眼里——它们认为自己是世界的领袖，世界的其他国家应当跟着它们走——一样，现在有些远东国家中也有一种趋向于忘记世界上还有其他不能无视的国家的倾向。他们忘记了印度不是一个可以忽视的国家，虽然它讲话的语气可能比较温和，像它不仅在最近而且甚至在过去的年代习于所做的那样。”
    尼赫鲁说，“我非常钦佩中国人的思想的合乎逻辑、合乎情理和相当冷静。但是，我有时候怀疑，所有这些原有的品质是不是有一部分已经消失了。因此我们必须谨慎。我们当然必须警惕，而且必须采取我们所能够采取的措施来维护我们的完整。”他说，“我们必须采取坚定的态度，我们必须坚持我们的立场。”但是，他又说，“我将永远努力寻求和平解决的办法，因为我要考虑到未来。如果将来印度和中国之间长期继续存在敌对状态，未来将是黑暗的。”
    尼赫鲁说，“当然，没有进行战争的客观理由，没有实际的理由，没有明显的理由，没有任何理由。无论你以哪种态度处理它，对我们来说，为这种问题而战，将是极其愚蠢的。……当这种冲突发生的时候，就发生了扰乱我们内心的信念的某种事情，发生了伤害我们的自豪感、我们的民族自豪感、我们的自尊心等等的某种事情。……这并不是为了一块领土，而是因为他们感到，他们在这个问题上没有受到公平的对待，他们受到了中国政府相当随便的对待，并且企图威吓——如果我可以用这个字眼的话——他们。”
    尼赫鲁再次说“麦克马洪线”是印度的疆界。他说，“从取得独立的头几个月开始，在头一两年内，我就屡次在议会说，麦克马洪线是我们的疆界。当我在议会讲话的时候，那就是讲给外界听的，如果我可以这样说的话，那就是讲给中国政府听的。”他又说，“我们已经向他们（中国）建议——没有其他办法——说我们必须接受现状，并且让我们来就这些各别的地方进行讨论。我不知道，也不理解我们如何能够讨论这样广泛的地区。我们可以就那些可能存在着什么争端和可能引起了不满意的个别的地方进行讨论。接受或者遵守麦克马洪线是一回事，但是在这里那里具体地划线完全是另外一回事。”
    尼赫鲁不同意过去英国帝国主义的侵略是中印边界纠纷的基本原因的说法。他说：“现在我们也常常使用、而他们经常使用的一个很爱用的字眼——但这个字眼中国当局特别爱用——是‘帝国主义’。不错，世界上存在着帝国主义。我们对它有充分的了解，对它极其厌恶。我们一直在对它进行斗争。但是在我看来，有时候，这个字眼被用来掩盖每一桩罪恶和每一件事情，好像它是每一个论点的说明似的。只要说‘帝国主义’，就回答了一切。”他说，“现在提出这些问题，理由是许多许多年以前英帝国主义曾在那里发生作用，在我看来，这确是一种奇怪的论点。”
    尼赫鲁说，“中国在今天是一个巨大的、非常大的、庞大的国家。难道这个中国是从‘梵天’（印度教的创世者——编者注）的头脑里产生出来就这样的吗？它是怎么变得这样大、这样巨大的？肯定地说，这是靠在过去多少代里它的人民的能力和它的战士们的征服，换句话说也就是靠中国帝国主义。”
    尼赫鲁不同意从最近几十年的现代历史上说明中印边界的情况。他说，“在历史上你把线划在甚么地方？历史中充满了机遇，充满了盛衰，充满了各种各样的事物，充满了民族和国家的融合。如果那样回溯的话，今天世界上就没有一个国家不可以从根本上被动摇和分裂。”他说，“中国对这些简单的人之常情的因素似乎也不承认，而且归根到底对印度的友谊很不重视，这是很奇怪的事情。”
    谈到中印边界情况时，尼赫鲁说，“所有这些边界问题可以分为三部分。一部分，一般说来，就是从缅甸边界到不丹边界的所谓麦克马洪线；其次是北方邦、旁遮普、拉豪尔和斯皮蒂；然后才是拉达克。你必须分别对待这些地方。……我们一向认为拉达克地区是不同的地区，并且就边界来说，是一个较含糊的——如果我可以这样说的话——地区，因为确切的边界线根本是不清楚的，不像麦克马洪线那样。当我们在1958年，在一年多以前发现中国在拉达克东北角修建了一条越过叶城的公路的时候，我们感到忧虑。我们并不知道这条公路是在什么地方……我们离那个地区有一百英里远。这是个不能住人的地区，而且一直没有受到过任何的管辖。”
    关于中国提出的印度军队侵入中国领土的问题，尼赫鲁说，“什么是侵略，什么不是侵略，当然要看你把分界线划在哪里而定。”谈到具体发生交火的朗久地方，他说，“我们从我们的人那里得到一种说法，毫无疑问，他们从他们的人那里得到一种说法。两种说法不一样，它们互相矛盾。”
    在谈到地图问题的时候，他说：“一方面，我们得到了这样一些地图，在这些地图上，印度的大块土地被标得好像是中国的；另一方面，他们说，地图画得不精确，如果有必要，我们可以改变它们，不过我们不承认麦克马洪线。谁也不能确切了解，他们对于那条线划在那里究竟是怎样想的。一个大国采取这样的立场是非常奇特的。即使我们同意那一点，这也意味着让问题处于含糊不清的状态，而发生麻烦的可能性始终是存在的。”
    他还特意提到了中缅边界问题。他说，是他建议周恩来总理和吴努就边界问题举行会谈的。他说，“但是我遗憾地说，虽然这已是好些时日以前的事——有三年半了——这些会谈还没有在缅甸产生效果。问题仍然存在。缅甸有人觉得，给予吴努的有关边界的保证并未为中国所履行。”
    尼赫鲁谈到西藏叛乱和印度对达赖喇嘛的政策时说，“毫无疑问，他们（中国）在那里遇到了困难；当然，西藏人民遇到的困难要大得多。也许他们对我们所做的事情的反应很强烈，我指的是我们给予达赖喇嘛避难权以及其他某些因素。我们一直设法走中间道路。我们尊敬达赖喇嘛。许许多多人都尊敬他。这并不意味着我们在一切问题上都同意他。在某些方面，他今天的做法是错的。就我们所提的劝告来说，我们曾经竭力告诉他，说他现在的做法是错误的。如果他把西藏问题提到联合国去，那将不会有什么好处。”尼赫鲁说，“我必需说，他在很大程度上接受了我们的劝告，那就是说，关于不要热衷于政治争论的劝告。但是有时候他没有接受，而这对我们来说是一个很难决定的问题。我们不想干涉他的事情，我们希望让他享有是限定范围内的行动自由。但是，无疑这一切必然已经影响到，并且现在仍在影响着中国的情绪；也许正是由于这一点，而不是由于中国对印度、对我们的边界的态度中逻辑或者情理，所以他们才采取一种刻板的态度。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到中印友谊的时候说：“我认为我们努力争取他们的友谊是做得对的，而且我可以再说一遍：我们将继续努力争取他们的友谊。任何对印度的今日和未来负有丝毫责任的人，决不能让自己惊恐和激怒，决不能在惊恐和愤怒的心情支配下行动。”
    谈到印度的外交政策时，尼赫鲁说，“我不了解，现在已变得严重起来的目前局势同我们的外交政策受到所谓严酷考验有什么关系。就我而论，就我们的政府而论，我们的外交政策是坚如磐石的，它将继续是这样。别的某个政府可能改变它。目前的政府不会改变它，目前的政府将坚持不结盟政策，因为这是一个原则问题，而不是见机行事的手段或一时的方便的问题。”
