Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 16th -- The Chinese Exhibition Group participating in the Vienna Fair issued the following statement:
    The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, in order to promote friendship between the Chinese and Austrian people and strengthen mutual understanding between the two peoples, accepted the repeated invitations of the Vienna Fair and sent an exhibition group to participate in the fair. Since the opening of our pavilion, it has received enthusiastic support and praise from the broad masses of the Austrian people. We express our gratitude for the friendly actions of the Austrian people. However, a small number of Austrian reactionaries attempted to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and Austrian people, hinder trade between the two countries, and insult the People's Republic of China. On September 9th, they groundlessly fabricated a so-called patent lawsuit over lighters, forcibly sealed our exhibition cabinet, robbed our exhibits, and intruded into the office of the head of our exhibition group without consent, disrupting work and threatening the head of our exhibition group, forbidding him from attending a reception invited by the official Vienna bank and insulting our staff with criminal summonses. After the head of our exhibition group lodged a serious protest on the spot, the threatening personnel left the office of our head of delegation. After our group's solemn protest and the enthusiastic assistance and negotiation of friendly people in Austrian business circles, this fabricated lawsuit was withdrawn on the afternoon of September 10th. At the same time, the manager of the fair accompanied the Austrian Minister of Interior and the Chief of Police of Vienna to our pavilion, where the manager of the fair formally apologized to our head of delegation. On the afternoon of September 13th, the police chief of the police station where our pavilion was located came to the pavilion to formally apologize again. But on the other hand, the Austrian reactionary newspapers took this opportunity to carry out a series of slanders against the People's Republic of China, which have not been corrected to this day. The stolen exhibits have not been accounted for. Therefore, on the 13th, Ji Chao Ding, the head of our exhibition group, wrote to the manager of the Vienna Fair, lodging a serious protest again against this political conspiracy created by the reactionaries, requesting the Fair authorities to publicly announce their apology to our side, and we reserve the right to demand compensation for all our losses. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China ten years ago, the friendship between the Chinese and Austrian people has been developing day by day, which can never be undermined by a small number of reactionaries. It is hoped that the political conspiracy manufactured by the reactionaries this time can be widely exposed and quickly corrected, and that our demands can be fully resolved. We believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Austrian people will be more consolidated and developed. We hereby declare.
  Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 16th -- Vienna dispatch: The great success of the Chinese Exhibition Hall at the Vienna International Autumn Fair has aroused the hatred of a small number of Austrian reactionaries. They fabricated a so-called lawsuit claiming that China infringed on Austrian lighter patents, and openly insulted the staff of the Exhibition Group of the People's Republic of China in an attempt to achieve their goal of undermining the friendly relations between the Chinese and Austrian people and hindering the development of trade between the two countries.
    On September 9, a group of lawyers, economic police, and criminal police suddenly appeared at the Chinese Pavilion, forcibly sealed one of our exhibition cabinets, and robbed an exhibited lighter. Without permission, they broke into the office of the head of the Chinese Exhibition Group, made unreasonable demands, and even threatened the head of delegation, Ji Chao Ding, not to go out to attend the reception held by the "Austrian Federal Bank." This group of people simply disregarded the most basic international etiquette and openly took out criminal summonses to insult the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Group. The "Courier" newspaper, run with American capital, was clearly prepared for this deliberate act of insulting the Chinese people, and specially sent reporters to accompany the police to the Chinese Pavilion to take photographs and promote it extensively. Some reactionary newspapers in Austria also launched a series of slanderous propaganda against China.
    The personnel of the Chinese Exhibition Group sternly refuted this slander on the spot, firmly refused to accept the summons, and protested against this unreasonable action.

    奥地利反动分子在我展览馆捣乱
    我展览团发表声明表示抗议
    新华社日内瓦16日电　中华人民共和国参加维也纳博览会展览团发表声明如下：
    中华人民共和国国际贸易促进委员会为了促进中奥两国人民间的友谊，加强两国人民间的相互了解，接受了维也纳博览会的一再邀请，派出展览团参加了博览会。我国展览馆开幕以后，立刻得到奥地利广大人民的热烈支持和赞扬。对奥地利人民的友谊行动我们表示感谢。但是奥地利一小撮的反动分子企图破坏中奥人民间的友好关系，阻碍中奥两国间的贸易，并对我中华人民共和国进行侮辱，在9月9日竟无中生有地制造了所谓打火机的专利权讼案，强迫封锁我展览柜，抢劫我展览品，未经同意侵入我展览团团长办公室，扰乱工作，并威胁我展览团长不许出外参加维也纳官方银行邀请的招待会并用刑事传票方式侮辱我团工作人员。在我展览团长当场提出严重抗议之后，威胁的人员才离开我团长办公室；并在我团严正抗议及奥工商界友好人士热心协助交涉之下，这个制造出来的讼案9月10日下午才告撤销。同时，博览会经理陪同奥内政部长、维也纳警察总长来我馆，由博览会经理向我团长正式道歉。9月13日下午，我展览馆所在地的警察局长又来馆正式道歉。但另一方面，奥地利反动报纸却借此对我中华人民共和国进行一系列的诬蔑，这些诬蔑至今未加纠正，对劫走我展品至今仍未交代。因此我展览团团长冀朝鼎于13日致函维也纳博览会经理，对这一次反动分子制造出来的政治阴谋，再次提出严重抗议，要求博览会当局将对我方的道歉公开公布，我方并保留要求赔偿我一切损失的权利。中华人民共和国成立十年以来，中奥人民间的友谊是日益发展的，这决不是一小撮反动分子所破坏得了的。希望这次反动分子所制造的政治阴谋，能够得到广泛的揭露和迅速的纠正，我们的要求能够得到完满的解决。相信中奥两国人民间的友谊是会更加巩固和向前发展的。特此声明。
  据新华社日内瓦16日电　维也纳消息：中国展览馆在维也纳国际秋季博览会上获得的巨大成功，引起了奥地利一小撮反动分子的仇视。他们竟无中生有地制造了所谓中国侵犯奥地利打火机专利权的诉讼案，公然侮辱中华人民共和国展览团工作人员，企图达到他们破坏中奥人民间的友好关系和阻挠两国发展贸易的目的。
    9月9日突然有一批律师、经济警察和刑事警察出现在中国馆，强迫封锁我一个展览柜，并劫走了展出的一件打火机。他们不经许可就擅自侵入了中国展览团团长的办公室，无理取闹，竟然威胁冀朝鼎团长不得外出参加“奥地利联邦银行”举行的招待会；这批人简直连最起码的国际礼貌都不顾，公然拿出刑事传票来侮辱中国展览团的工作人员。用美国资本办的“信使报”对这一蓄意侮辱中国人民的举动显然早有准备，特别派出记者随同警察到中国馆摄影，大肆宣传。奥地利的一些反动报纸也随着掀起了一系列诬蔑中国的宣传。
    中国展览团人员当场严正驳斥了这种诬蔑，坚决拒绝接受传票，并且对这种无理行动提出抗议。
