    From Empty Hands to Steel Flowers Bursting
    Deng Chenxi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

            In a Short Year

    Shandong Province originally had no iron and steel industry. Construction began in 1958, and within a short year, it has achieved tremendous development. As of now, the province's medium and small blast furnaces, ranging from three cubic meters to two hundred and fifty-five cubic meters, have an annual pig iron production capacity of 1.4 million tons; the annual production capacity of small steelmaking converters has reached more than 300,000 tons; and the annual production capacity of small rolling mills has reached more than 200,000 tons.

    In such a short year, the reason why my province's iron and steel industry has been able to rise from nothing and rapidly improve is mainly the result of the people of the entire province, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, resolutely implementing the Party's general line for building socialism and the principles and policies for rapidly developing the iron and steel industry in our country.

        Walking on Two Legs, Striding Forward

    Last year, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, the broad masses of people in our province rapidly launched a high tide of people's communalization, water conservancy construction, and large-scale local industry development. In this series of construction upsurges, we felt the urgent need for steel and recognized that only by vigorously developing the iron and steel industry can we accelerate the process of socialist construction. Initially, we mainly placed our hopes for the development of the iron and steel industry on the construction of modern iron and steel enterprises. We started preparing for the construction of two medium and small iron and steel plants. After five months of hard work and with the support of fraternal provinces, the first 84-cubic-meter small blast furnace produced its first batch of molten iron before the "May Day" holiday last year. At that time, the people of the whole province were enthusiastically cheering, but they also felt that relying solely on a few foreign blast furnaces was too few and too slow, and could not meet the needs of rapid development in various fields for steel. At that time, some cadres and the masses tried to use indigenous methods to produce iron. As a result, in June last year, the first batch of iron was produced in a small indigenous furnace in Kouzhen, Laiwu County. The Provincial Party Committee seized the opportunity, convened a provincial on-site meeting, and organized the promotion of this experience. After the Party Central Committee issued the great call for the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry in August last year, the broad masses of the people in the province warmly responded and launched a massive and vigorous mass movement to develop the iron and steel industry throughout the province. The people of the entire province resolutely implemented the Party's policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises. They quickly found a large number of iron and coal resources in more than 60 counties and cities, and built various types of indigenous blast furnaces, small blast furnaces, indigenous steelmaking furnaces, and small converters. The first 255-cubic-meter blast furnace of the medium-sized iron and steel plant was built and put into production in an astonishing five months. Truly, molten iron flowed and steel flowers burst. With soaring enthusiasm, the broad masses of people, relying on thousands of small indigenous blast furnaces and individual medium and small foreign blast furnaces, relying on indigenous methods of mining and indigenous methods of coking, produced 500,500 tons of pig iron and 250,000 tons of steel in four months, creating an unprecedented miracle in the history of the iron and steel industry.

      The Mass Campaign for Iron and Steel Enters a New Stage

    In 1959, we mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of iron and steel production and carry out rectification, consolidation, and improvement work, so that the mass campaign for iron and steel entered a new stage. Based on the principles of being close to mines, close to coal, and convenient for transportation, the province carried out the "five fixings" (fixing location, fixing personnel, fixing groups, fixing furnaces, and fixing leadership), so that the furnace groups basically achieved factoryization and basification. Immediately afterwards, the province launched a socialist labor competition movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation, continuously strengthening enterprise management, timely summarizing and promoting various advanced experiences, and universally carrying out technological transformation, thereby enabling medium and small blast furnaces to rapidly replace the small indigenous furnaces that had adapted to the development of the situation last winter. Production efficiency has been greatly improved, quality has been continuously improved, and costs have been significantly reduced. At present, the average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in our province has reached 1.2, the coke ratio has been reduced to 1:1.1, the quality has reached 78%, and many advanced blast furnaces with long life, high quality, high yield, and low cost have emerged. Practice has proved that small blast furnaces have many advantages, such as relatively simple equipment manufacturing, easy mastery of technical operation, low investment, and fast construction, especially suitable for relatively scattered mines, coal mines, and the utilization of civilian transportation tools. At present, small blast furnaces and small converters have become a main force in my province's iron and steel production. They undertake the main tasks of the entire iron and steel production and have established great achievements in my province's iron and steel production. At the same time, they are constantly developing and advancing towards a more advanced direction with infinite vitality. The facts in my province prove that combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small enterprises, is a correct policy for developing my country's iron and steel industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

        One Horse Takes the Lead, Ten Thousand Horses Gallop

    The vigorous development of the iron and steel industry is the driving force for promoting all work in the province. In the past, the workers of the province's machinery factories had never manufactured smelting equipment, but last year they manufactured a large amount of smelting equipment in a short period of time; the workers on the transportation front, in order to ensure transportation, promoted the experience of high platforms, low cargo positions, quick loading and unloading, and full load and over-axle, implemented the trainization of automobiles and horse-drawn carriages, and built wooden and earthen railways everywhere. At the beginning, everyone did not understand smelting technology, so they adopted the method of combining leading cadres with workers and technicians to study and solve problems. Over the past year, we have personally witnessed the great development of the iron and steel industry, which has driven the great leap forward in other industries. For example, in the coal industry, the average annual output growth rate was 11.2% during the first five-year plan period, 1.23 times higher in 1958 than in 1957, and 1.25 times higher in the first eight months of 1959 than in the same period last year. The province's power generation capacity grew at an average annual rate of 15% during the first five-year plan period, 55.9% higher in 1958 than in 1957; 60.15% higher in the first eight months of 1959 than in the same period last year. In the machinery industry, in 1958 alone, 25,210 tons of smelting equipment were completed; as for light industry, the chemical industry, the textile industry, etc., they have also shown unprecedented great development. This fact of a comprehensive leap forward with one horse taking the lead and ten thousand horses galloping fully proves that the Party's policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward is the only correct path for building my country's socialist industry.

    It is a Production Movement as well as a Political Movement

    The development of the iron and steel industry over the past year has caused a series of profound changes in various aspects. The vigorous development of the iron and steel industry is not only a huge production movement but also a great political movement. In a short year, my province has built a large number of medium and small blast furnaces and converters, and has correspondingly developed coal mining, ore mining, coking, transportation and other enterprises that directly serve iron and steel production, cultivated a strong iron and steel team, and accumulated rich production experience, laying the foundation for the future development of my province's iron and steel industry. From August last year to August this year, in addition to supplying the needs of various aspects of the province for steel, the province has transferred more than 800,000 tons of pig iron to support national construction. It should be said that this is a fundamental and significant change in the development of Shandong's national economy. Through the development of the iron and steel industry and the initial formation of iron and steel bases, the past unreasonable industrial layout of my province has begun to change. With the development of the iron and steel industry, more than 100,000 new enterprises of different scales have been developed accordingly. These new enterprises are spread throughout the province and will gradually form many new industrial bases, laying a more reasonable foundation for the layout of the entire industry in the future. The mass movement for the vigorous development of the iron and steel industry has not only changed the economic landscape of my province, but also greatly improved the Party's leadership level and changed people's thinking. Throughout the entire movement, the principle of putting politics in command, emphasizing ideological leadership, emphasizing that cadres go deep into the grassroots, eat, live, and work with the masses, implement two participations, one reform, and three combinations, and engage in experimental fields and secretary furnaces has been implemented from beginning to end, further strengthening the Party's ties with the masses and beginning to learn how to lead the mass movement of industry, making political work and economic work more closely integrated. The communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do has been universally promoted among employees, and therefore, countless creations and inventions have emerged. Many intellectuals participated in labor and received practical education and training in the mass movement. People refine steel, and steel refines people. In fact, the vigorous development of the iron and steel industry is also a widespread and in-depth communist education movement.

    From the practice of the past year, we have deeply realized that only by implementing the policy of taking steel as the key link, achieving a comprehensive leap forward, and walking on two legs can we accelerate socialist construction. As for the curses and clamors of all domestic and foreign reactionaries and right-leaning opportunists, saying that the mass movement for the vigorous development of the iron and steel industry is "petty-bourgeois fanaticism," attacking small blast furnaces for their low output, poor quality, high cost, and large waste, and that the vigorous development of the iron and steel industry is "not worth the loss," as well as seizing on individual and temporary imbalances in the national economy and slandering that taking steel as the key link "squeezed out everything," attempting to negate the great achievements of the vigorous development of the iron and steel industry and attack the Party's general line, in essence, reflects their frustration and panic at the victory of the great leap forward of our people. The great achievements of my province's vigorous development of the iron and steel industry have completely shattered all the rumors and slanders of domestic and foreign reactionaries and refuted the fallacies of right-leaning opportunists.

    从手无寸铁到钢花四溅
    中共山东省委书记处书记　邓辰西
            短短一年间
    山东省原来没有钢铁工业，从1958年开始建设，短短的一年内，已经得到巨大的发展。到目前为止，全省三立方米以上二百五十五立方米以下的中、小炼铁高炉，年产生铁能力已达一百四十万吨；小型炼钢转炉的年产能力已达三十多万吨；小型轧钢设备能力年产已达二十余万吨。
    在短短一年间，我省钢铁工业所以能够从无到有，迅速的提高，主要是全省人民在党中央和省委的正确领导下，坚决贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线和关于在我国迅速发展钢铁工业的方针和政策的结果。
        两条腿走路健步如飞
    去年，我省广大人民在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，迅速掀起了人民公社化、兴修水利和大办地方工业的高潮。在这一系列建设高潮中，我们突出的感到钢铁的需要，认识到只有大力发展钢铁工业才能加速社会主义建设的进程。开始，我们把发展钢铁工业主要寄托在建设近代化的钢铁企业上。我们着手筹建了两处中、小型钢铁厂，经过五个月的努力，与兄弟省的支持，第一座八十四立方米的小高炉，在去年“五一”节前流出了第一炉铁水。当时全省人民无不热烈次呼，但也感到：仅凭少数洋高炉数量太少，速度太慢，怎能满足各方面建设飞跃发展对钢铁的需要。那时部分干部、群众试用土法炼铁，结果去年6月间在莱芜县口镇用小土炉炼出了第一炉铁。省委抓紧时机，召开了全省现场会议，并组织推广这一经验。去年8月间，党中央发布了全党全民大办钢铁的伟大号召之后，全省广大人民热烈响应，在全省范围内开展了一个声势浩大、轰轰烈烈的大办钢铁的群众运动。全省人民坚决贯彻执行了党的土洋并举、大中小并举的两条腿走路的方针，很快地在六十多个县、市找到了大量的铁矿和煤矿资源，建成了各式各样的土高炉和小高炉、土炼钢炉和小转炉。中型钢铁厂的第一座二百五十五立方米高炉，以惊人的速度在五个月内建成投入生产。真是铁水奔流、钢花四溅。广大群众以冲天的干劲，依靠成千上万小土高炉和个别中、小型的洋高炉，依靠土法采矿，土法炼焦，在四个月内，便生产了五十万零五千吨生铁，二十五万吨钢，创造了钢铁工业史无前例的奇迹。
      大办钢铁迈上新阶段
    1959年，我们发动群众总结钢铁生产的经验，进行整顿、巩固和提高工作，使大办钢铁运动又迈上了一个新阶段。根据就矿、就煤和交通便利的原则，全省进行了五定（定点、定员、定组、定炉、定领导）工作，使炉群基本上达到了工厂化和基地化。紧接着全省又开展了以技术革命与技术革新为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，不断加强企业管理，及时总结推广各种先进经验，普遍进行技术改造，从而使中、小高炉迅速代替了适应去冬形势发展起来的小土炉，生产效率大大的提高，质量不断的改进，成本显著降低。目前我省小高炉的平均利用系数达到一点二，焦比降低为一比一点一，质量达到78％，并出现了不少的长寿、优质、高产、低成本的先进高炉。实践证明，小高炉有许多优点，如设备制造比较简单，技术操作容易掌握、投资少、建设快，特别适于较分散的矿山、煤井和对民间运输工具的利用。目前小高炉、小转炉已是我省钢铁生产中的一支主力，它担负了整个钢铁生产中的主要任务，在我省钢铁生产中建立了巨大的功迹，同时正在以无穷的生命力向着更高级的方向不断的发展迈进。从我省的事实证明，土洋并举，大中小并举，正是多、快、好、省的发展我国钢铁工业的一条正确的方针。
        一马当先，万马奔腾
    大办钢铁是推动全省一切工作的动力。过去，全省机械厂的职工们从未制造过冶炼设备，但去年在短时间内制造出大量的冶炼设备；运输战线上的职工们，为了保证运输，推广了高站台、低货位快装快卸、满载超轴等经验，实行汽车、马车列车化、到处搞木轨道、土铁路。开始时大家不懂冶炼技术，就采取领导干部与工人、技术人员三结合的办法钻研解决。一年来，我们亲眼看到钢铁工业的大发展，带动了其他工业大跃进。如煤炭工业，在第一个五年计划期间，平均每年产量增长11.2％，1958年比1957年增长1.23倍，1959年1至8月份比去年同期又增长了1.25倍。全省发电量在第一个五年计划期间每年平均增长15％，1958年比1957年增长55.9％；1959年1至8月份又比去年同期增长60.15％。机械工业，1958年仅冶炼设备即完成二万五千二百一十吨；至于轻工、化工、纺织等工业也都表现着前所未有的巨大发展。这种一马当先、万马奔腾的全面跃进的事实，充分证明了党的以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针，正是建设我国社会主义工业的唯一正确的道路。
    是生产运动也是政治运动
    一年来钢铁工业的发展，引起了各方面一系列深刻的变化。大办钢铁不仅是一个巨大的生产运动也是一个伟大的政治运动。短短一年内，我省建设起大批的中小高炉和转炉，相应地发展了采煤、采矿、炼焦、交通运输等直接为钢铁生产服务的企业，培养了一支强大的钢铁队伍，积累了丰富的生产经验，为我省今后钢铁工业的发展奠定了基础。从去年8月到今年8月，除了供应本省各方面对钢铁的需要外，全省已调出八十多万吨生铁支援国家建设。应该说，这在山东国民经济的发展中是一个带有根本性的重大变化。通过钢铁工业的发展和钢铁基地的初步形成，开始改变着我省过去工业布局不合理的局面。随着钢铁工业的发展，相应的发展了十几万个新企业，这些规模不同的新企业，遍及了省内各地，将逐步形成许多新的工业基地，为今后整个工业的布局打下了比较合理的基础。大办钢铁的群众运动不仅改变着我省的经济面貌，而且大大地提高了党的领导水平，改变了人们的思想面貌。在整个运动中，自始至终贯彻了政治挂帅、思想领先、强调了干部深入下层，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，实行两参、一改、三结合，以及搞试验田、书记炉等，进一步加强了党和群众的联系，开始学会了领导工业的群众运动，使政治工作与经济工作更密切的结合起来。在职工中普遍的发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，因而创造发明层出不穷。许多知识分子参加了劳动，在群众运动中得到了实际教育和锻炼，人炼钢、钢炼人，实际上大办钢铁也就是一次广泛深入的共产主义教育运动。
    从一年来的实践中，使我们深深地体会到：只有贯彻实行以钢为纲、全面跃进、两条腿走路的方针，才能加速社会主义建设。至于国内外的一切反动派和右倾机会主义分子的咒骂叫嚣，说什么，大办钢铁的群众运动是“小资产阶级的狂热性”，攻击小高炉产量低、质量差、成本高、浪费大，大办钢铁是“得不偿失”，以及抓住国民经济生活中个别的、一时的失调现象，污蔑以钢为纲是“挤掉了一切”，企图否定大办钢铁的丰功伟绩和攻击党的总路线，实质上正反映了他们在我国人民大跃进的胜利下的沮丧和恐慌。我省大办钢铁的伟大成就，完全粉碎了国内外反动派的一切造谣污蔑，驳倒了右倾机会主义分子的谬论。（附图片）
