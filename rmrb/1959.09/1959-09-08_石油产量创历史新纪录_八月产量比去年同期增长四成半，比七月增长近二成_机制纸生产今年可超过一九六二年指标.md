Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: The nation's petroleum workers exceeded their monthly crude oil production plan in August, setting the highest monthly production record in the history of China's petroleum industry. This month, national crude oil production increased by 18.2% compared to July, and by 45% compared to the same period last year.

On the foundation of the Great Leap Forward last year, China's petroleum industry continues to leap forward this year. From January to July, crude oil production increased by 68.6% compared to the same period last year. August crude oil production soared even higher, increasing by 10% in the middle ten days of the month compared to the first ten days, and by another 8% in the last ten days compared to the middle ten days. The output on August 29th was 8.4% higher than the previous highest daily output. Moreover, this high daily production level has been maintained until September 5th.

Since August, major oilfields such as Yumen, Xinjiang, and Qinghai have vigorously strengthened oil well management and repair work. In the Laojunmiao oilfield of Yumen, some oil wells experienced poor oil flow due to wax blockage and sand blockage. After repairs, more than 5,200 tons of crude oil were added to the production. Due to the strengthening of a series of measures in oil well management, more than 5,000 tons of crude oil were also added to the production. While ensuring the quality of drilling, all major oilfields have increased drilling speed, allowing a large number of new wells to be put into production in a timely manner. In August alone, 62 new oil wells in the Yuerxia of Yumen, Karamay of Xinjiang, and Lenghu of Qinghai were put into production, greatly increasing crude oil production. In the past, the Karamay and Lenghu oilfields could not fully realize their production capacity because the various links between oil extraction, oil storage, oil refining, and oil transportation were not balanced. In recent months, they have vigorously accelerated the construction speed of refineries and oil tanks in order to achieve balance. The expansion projects of the Karamay Refinery and the Dushanzi Refinery, as well as the Lenghu Refinery and a number of oil tanks, were put into production one after another in August. In particular, the Karamay and Lenghu oilfields have strengthened petroleum transportation, improved transportation efficiency, and added more than 1,000 oil trucks and tanker trailers around August. This has allowed the production potential of the oilfields to be better realized. In the Northeast, artificial oil plants have greatly improved oil recovery and shale utilization by improving the technical operation of dry distillation furnaces, overcoming the difficulties brought about by the rainy season, grasping the utilization of granular shale, and reducing crude oil losses.

At present, petroleum industry workers in various regions are deeply developing a socialist labor competition centered on improving oil recovery rate, refining rate, and transportation efficiency, making persistent efforts, fighting a big battle in September, and striving to overfulfill the third quarter production plan and greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: From January to August this year, China's machine-made paper production increased by 29.7% compared with the same period last year. According to this leap-forward speed, it is estimated that the annual machine-made paper production can exceed the original 1962 target (1.5 million to 1.6 million tons) three years ahead of schedule, reaching 1.7 million to 1.8 million tons.

Under the encouragement of the Party's fighting call, the nation's paper industry workers are opposing Rightist tendencies, boosting their energy, and launching a new production upsurge. According to the statistics of 32 key enterprises, the output of machine-made paper in late August increased by more than 10% compared with mid-August, reaching 3,758 tons on August 30, creating the highest daily output record since this year. In September, the workers of each paper mill will make full use of the favorable conditions of suitable temperature to create greater production achievements and greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of local Party committees, the paper industry has deeply carried out the movement to increase production and save resources with high output, high quality, low consumption, and safe production. During the movement, workers vigorously opened up sources of raw materials, saved electricity, and ensured the realization of production increase targets. Yingkou Paper Mill in Liaoning Province is one of China's large-scale paper mills that mainly produce pulp. The pulp produced by the factory supplies more than 60 paper mills across the country. All the workers of the factory found 48 ways to save electricity, creating the highest level of pulp production in the factory's history. The daily output of cooking has increased from about 20 cans to 30 cans, and the daily output of pulp has increased from more than 200 tons to 400 tons. Shanghai Paper Company has received support from the people's communes in Zhejiang and the suburbs of Shanghai, and has established a native grass pulp raw material base. Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and other cities have carried out mass waste paper recycling work. The widespread technical innovation and technical revolution activities in paper mills across the country have played a significant role in increasing paper production and reducing consumption quotas.

### 石油产量创历史新纪录  八月产量比去年同期增长四成半，比七月增长近二成  机制纸生产今年可超过一九六二年指标

    石油产量创历史新纪录
    八月产量比去年同期增长四成半，比七月增长近二成
    机制纸生产今年可超过一九六二年指标
    新华社7日讯　全国石油职工8月份超额完成全月原油生产计划，创造了我国石油工业史上最高的月产纪录。这个月，全国原油产量比7月份增长18.2％，比去年同期增长了45％。
    我国石油工业在去年大跃进的基础上，今年继续跃进。
  1月至7月份，原油产量比去年同期增长68.6％。8月份原油产量更是扶摇直上，中旬比上旬增长10％，下旬又比中旬增长8％，8月29日的产量比以前的最高日产量还高8.4％。而且到9月5日，一直保持着这个高的日产水平。
      8月份以来，玉门、新疆、青海等几个主要油区都大力加强了油井管理和油井的修理工作。玉门老君庙油田有一部分油井因为腊堵、沙堵等原因出油不畅，经过修理，增产了五千二百多吨原油；由于加强了油井管理方面的一系列措施，也增产了五千多吨原油。各个主要油区在保证钻井质量的基础上，提高了钻井速度，使大批新井及时地投入了生产。仅玉门鸭儿峡、新疆克拉玛依、青海冷湖等三处油田，8月份就有六十二口新油井投入生产，从而大大地提高了原油产量。克拉玛依、冷湖两个油田，过去因为采油、储油、炼油、运油之间各个环节不够均衡，因此油田生产能力不能充分发挥。最近几个月，他们为了取得平衡，大力加强了炼油厂和油罐的建设速度，克拉玛依炼油厂和独山子炼油厂的扩建工程、冷湖炼油厂和一批油罐都在8月份相继投入生产。特别是克拉玛依和冷湖两处油田，由于加强了石油运输工作，提高了运输效率，并且在8月前后新增了一千多辆运油的汽车和油罐拖车。这样，就使油田的生产潜力更好地发挥出来。东北地区的人造油厂，由于改进了干馏炉的技术操作，克服了雨季带来的困难，抓紧了颗粒页岩的利用，减少了原油的损失，也大大地提高了采油率和页岩利用率。
    目前，各地石油工业职工正在深入开展以提高采油率、炼率和运输效率为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛，再接再厉，大战9月份，为超额完成第三季度生产计划，迎接伟大的国庆十周年而奋勇前进。
    据新华社7日讯　今年1月至8月份，我国机制纸产量比去年同期增长了29.7％，根据这样的跃进速度，预计今年全年机制纸产量可以提前三年超额完成原定1962年的指标（一百五十万至一百六十万吨），达到一百七十万吨至一百八十万吨。
    全国造纸工业职工在党的战斗号召的鼓舞下，反右倾，鼓干劲，掀起了新的生产高潮。根据三十二个重点企业的统计，8月下旬机制纸的产量比中旬提高10％以上，8月30日达到三千七百五十八吨，创造了今年以来日产量的最高纪录。9月份，各纸厂职工将充分利用气温适宜的有利条件，创造更大的生产成就，迎接国庆十周年。今年以来，造纸工业在各地党委的领导下，深入地开展了高产、优质、低耗和安全生产的增产节约运动。运动中，职工们大力开辟原料来源，节约用电，保证实现增产指标。辽宁省营口造纸厂是我国以产纸浆为主的大型造纸厂之一，所产纸浆供应全国六十多个造纸厂。全厂职工找出了四十八项节约用电办法，创造了工厂有史以来纸浆生产的最高水平。蒸煮日产量由二十罐左右提高到三十罐，纸浆日产量由二百多吨提高到四百吨。上海市造纸公司得到了浙江及上海市郊等地人民公社的支持，建立了土草浆原料基地。上海、北京、天津等市，都开展了群众性的废纸回收工作。各地纸厂广泛开展的技术革新和技术革命活动，对提高纸的产量，降低消耗定额起了很大作用。
