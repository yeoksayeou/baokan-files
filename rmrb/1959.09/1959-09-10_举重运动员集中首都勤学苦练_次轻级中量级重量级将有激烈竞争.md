Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: (By our reporter Zhao Keming) More than 160 of the nation's top weightlifters participating in the First National Games are currently engaged in intensive training here in the capital, preparing for September 14th, the day they will begin competing for the various weightlifting championship titles.

These 160-plus strongmen represent twenty-eight units, hailing from various work positions across the country. Among them are workers from steel factories, rolling stock factories, the railway system, cotton mills, yarn mills, and frozen meat factories, as well as farmers and commune cadres from rural people's communes, teachers, drivers, designers, cooks, people's police, and students.

The competitors in this national competition are young, both in age and in their history of participation in the sport. Their average age is under twenty-five, the oldest being forty-eight-year-old Chang Guanqun, a veteran with more than twenty years of competition experience. The youngest is Qian Likai from Xinjiang, who is only seventeen. Yang Tangxian from Hubei is eighteen, and the three competitors from Ningxia are all nineteen. Most of them have only been involved in this sport for four or five years. However, they have already achieved significant results. Among them are twenty-eight masters of sport, and the vast majority are first-class athletes. The People's Liberation Army and Shanghai teams each have six masters of sport, the Guangdong team has four, and other teams such as Hebei, Beijing, Sichuan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, and Jiangsu also have many strong contenders.

Through excellent training, the athletes are all strong and powerful, with broad backs and thick waists. Some are as imposing as golden statues, such as the veteran Chang Guanqun and Wang Zongliang from Shaanxi, both weighing 120 kilograms. The lightest is Yang Jingkang from Qinghai, who weighs only 51 kilograms, but is also muscular and strong. The weightlifting competition will be held in seven weight classes. According to regulations, each unit can only enter one athlete per class, so the competitors selected by each unit are the strongest of the strong. It is expected that the competition in many weight classes will be very intense.

Chen Jingkai, the world record holder in the clean and jerk and national record holder in the total for the flyweight and featherweight divisions, will participate in the flyweight competition this time. Huang Qianghui, the world record holder in the clean and jerk in the lightweight division, Zhao Qingkui, the world record holder in the clean and jerk in the light heavyweight division, and Li Baiyu, the national record holder in the total for the middle heavyweight division, will compete in their original weight classes. In the featherweight division, You Jiadong from Inner Mongolia and Chen Jiafu from Sichuan, the national record holder in the snatch, both have the strength to lift around 330 kilograms. Mao Zhaofeng from Shanghai, Yu Zhuquan from Guangdong, Yang Zhaoquan from the People's Liberation Army, Xu Lishui from Fujian, and the veteran Yin Guohua from Beijing are also evenly matched. The competition for the middleweight champion will mainly take place between Zhu Hongquan, the national record holder, Shu Gang from Guangdong, and Peng Guofu from the People's Liberation Army. In the heavyweight competition, which will be held last, the veteran Chang Guanqun, who has held the national record in the total for many years, will compete against Han Laixiang from the People's Liberation Army. Han Laixiang is currently the national record holder in both the snatch and the clean and jerk in the heavyweight division, and last year his total was only 2.5 kilograms less than Chang Guanqun.

    举重运动员集中首都勤学苦练
    次轻级中量级重量级将有激烈竞争
    据新华社9日讯　本社记者赵克敏报道：参加第一届全国运动会的一百六十多名全国最优秀的举重选手正集中在这里勤学苦练，准备着9月14日这个开始争夺各项举重冠军称号的日子到来。
    这一百六十多名大力士代表着二十八个单位，他们来自祖国各地各种工作岗位。其中有来自钢铁厂、列车厂、铁路系统、棉织厂、纱厂、冻肉工厂的工人，有来自农村人民公社的农民、公社干部，也有教员、司机、设计员、厨师、人民警察和学生。
    参加这次全国性比赛的选手们不论从年龄和参加这项运动的历史来说都很年轻。他们的平均年龄不到二十五岁，最年长的有四十八岁，是已经有二十多年比赛经验的老将常冠群。最年轻的是新疆的钱立凯，他只有十七岁。湖北的杨唐先是十八岁，宁夏的三位选手都是十九岁。他们大部分人参加这项运动都只有四、五年的历史。可是，已经获得了很大成绩。他们中间有二十八名健将，其他绝大多数是一级运动员。代表队中解放军和上海队，都拥有六名运动健将，广东队拥有四名健将，其他如河北、北京、四川、安徽、黑龙江、江苏队中都有不少好手。
    由于从事了良好的锻炼，选手们个个是身强力壮、虎背熊腰，有的魁伟得像一座金刚，如老将常冠群、陕西的汪宗良都身重一百二十公斤，最轻的是青海的杨景康只有五十一公斤，但也是肌肉发达、结实有力。举重赛将按体重分七个等级举行。按规定，每个单位每一个级只能报一名选手参加比赛，因此各单位选拔出来的都是强手中的强手。预计许多等级的竞赛将是十分剧烈的。
    最轻量级和次轻量级的挺举世界纪录和总成绩全国纪录保持者陈镜开，这次将参加最轻量级的比赛。轻量级挺举世界纪录保持者黄强辉、轻重量级挺举世界纪录保持者赵庆奎、次重量级总成绩全国纪录保持者李白玉将分别在他们原来参加的一级中比赛。次轻量级中，内蒙古的尤家栋和抓举全国纪录保持者、四川的陈家富都有三百三十公斤左右的实力。上海的毛兆峰、广东的余祝权、解放军的杨兆权、福建的许丽水以及北京的老将殷国华也是势均力敌。中量级冠军的争夺战将主要在全国纪录保持者朱鸿全、广东的舒刚和解放军的彭国富三人中间展开。在最后举行的重量级比赛中，保持了多年总成绩全国纪录的老将常冠群将同解放军的韩来祥一比高低。韩来祥是目前重量级抓举和挺举两项全国纪录的保持者，去年他的总成绩只比常冠群差二点五公斤。
