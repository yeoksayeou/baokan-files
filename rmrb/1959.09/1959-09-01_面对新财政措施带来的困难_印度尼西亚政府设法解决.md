Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 28th: The Indonesian government is seeking solutions to a series of difficulties arising from the devaluation of 500-rupiah and 1,000-rupiah banknotes and the freezing of some bank deposits. The Fiscal Measures Committee, established by the government, announced today that those enterprises involved in production, export, and distribution (including transportation) that do not have the cash to pay their employees' salaries due to the new fiscal measures taken by the government may borrow from banks. However, the money borrowed from banks must be repaid within a short period. These enterprises can also contact banks for business operations. There is an upward trend in the prices of Indonesian commodities. The Jakarta military authorities announced today that the prices of rice, salt, kerosene, sugar, cooking oil, and textiles, as well as the circulation and storage of these daily necessities, will be placed under the supervision of the Committee for Managing Daily Necessities.

The Deputy Minister of Labor of Indonesia, Erningpradja, announced on the 27th that the government has taken note of certain direct consequences caused by the devaluation of large banknotes and the freezing of some bank deposits, such as the dismissal of workers and the delay in paying employee wages.

    面对新财政措施带来的困难
    印度尼西亚政府设法解决
    据新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚政府正在设法解决由于五百盾和一千盾的钞票贬值以及冻结银行的部分存款而产生的一系列困难。政府成立的财政措施委员会今天宣布，那些有关生产、出口和分配（包括运输）的企业如果由于政府采取的新的财政措施而没有现金支付它们的职工的薪金，可以向银行借款。可是它们向银行借的钱必须在短期以内归还。这些企业为了经营还可以同银行进行接触。印度尼西亚商品的价格有上涨的趋势。雅加达军事当局今天宣布，大米、食盐、煤油、糖、食油和纺织品的价格以及这些日用品的流通和贮存都要置于管理日用品的委员会的监督之下。
    印度尼西亚劳工部副部长埃尔宁普拉贾在27日宣布，政府已注意了大钞贬值和冻结部分银行存款所引起的某些直接后果，如开除工人和延期发给职工工资等。
