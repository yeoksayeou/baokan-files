Hebei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning
Autumn Vegetable Sowing Area Exceeds Last Year
Various Regions Continue Transplanting, Rushing to Plant, and Strengthening Field Management
    (Our report) The area sown with autumn vegetables in Hebei Province this year has reached over four million mu, more than double that of previous years. Currently, the entire province is seizing the time to continue transplanting and rush-planting, while also strengthening field management of autumn vegetables.
    This year's autumn vegetables are being planted quickly and in large quantities, due to the communes earnestly implementing the policy of combining collective planting with individual planting. Handan Prefecture, which is progressing the fastest, has now completed 149% of its planting plan, of which nearly 300,000 mu of autumn vegetables were planted by commune members using idle land. Zhangbei Prefecture, located on the Bashang Plateau, which has historically planted very few autumn vegetables, has sown more than 60,000 mu of autumn vegetables after implementing the policy of walking on two legs – collective planting and individual planting.
    Currently, communes throughout the province are strengthening the field management of autumn vegetables. Many communes have already thinned their Chinese cabbage, radishes, etc., and have cultivated them two or three times, and are beginning to apply fertilizer, allowing the large leaves to grow normally. Some communes are doing everything possible to accumulate fertilizer for autumn vegetables. For example, Anshan Commune in Changli County launched a "each household saves a bucket of manure" campaign, solving the problem of fertilizer shortage for more than 1,000 mu of autumn vegetables. Regions experiencing insect plagues are vigorously carrying out prevention and control measures.
    Under the slogan of "plant every point that can be planted, planting is better than not planting," various regions are continuing to plant and transplant autumn vegetables. (Li Pu)
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The autumn vegetable sowing work in various parts of Heilongjiang Province has been successfully completed. This year, the province has planted a total of 2,938,800 mu of autumn vegetables, an increase of 2.3% over last year. Currently, the early-planted cabbage and radishes have grown four to five leaves and are more than four inches tall. Farmers in various regions are strengthening field management to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables.
    Various parts of Heilongjiang Province began the intense autumn vegetable sowing work on July 10th. Many city workers, troops, and residents participated in the activity of rushing to plant autumn vegetables, so the planting was fast and good. This year, the preparatory work in various regions before autumn vegetable sowing was generally more thorough; after sowing, attention was also paid to strengthening field management. In Jiamusi City, more than 1,400 mu of vegetable fields were generally plowed and turned more than three times; the area adopting spot-sowing increased three to nine times compared to last year. In Harbin, Qiqihar and other eight cities, the average amount of base fertilizer applied to more than 700,000 mu of autumn vegetable land reached 6,000 jin, an increase of 33% over last year. The irrigated area for autumn vegetables has also been expanded this year.
    This year in Heilongjiang, units such as government organs, factories, mines, troops, enterprises, and schools have seen great development in self-sufficient vegetable production area. According to statistics from eight cities including Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang, the vegetable planting area of government organs and units reached 120,000 mu, more than double that of last year.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The autumn vegetable sowing work in Liaoning Province has been successfully completed, with the sown area increasing by 70% compared to last year. Currently, the vegetable seedlings have reached two to three inches in height, and have produced five or six tender leaves, generally showing full, uniform, strong, and vigorous growth. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables, the broad masses of vegetable farmers are vigorously strengthening field management of autumn vegetables.
    This year, autumn vegetable sowing was not only started early and acted upon quickly, but the sowing quality was also better than in previous years. 78% of the vegetable area was sown before the "Beginning of Autumn" solar term. The land for sowing autumn vegetables has generally undergone deep plowing, harrowing, compacting, and fertilization, and the water sources are also very sufficient. The autumn vegetable sowing area in Gaiping County has doubled this year compared to last year. In order to ensure timely sowing, each commune made overall arrangements for agricultural work based on the commune's manpower and material resources, with more than 30,000 people rushing to plant autumn vegetables every day. In addition to concentrating agricultural labor to carry out shock planting of vegetables, Shahe People's Commune in Anshan City temporarily transferred more than 350 people from commune-run industries to support the vegetable planting work. The commune overfulfilled its 2,000 mu autumn vegetable area in just ten days. In addition, vegetable communes in the suburbs of various cities have also received strong support from city workers, cadres, and citizens in the sowing process. Extensive cooperation between communes and between teams has also greatly accelerated the progress of autumn vegetable sowing.

    秋菜播种面积超过去年
    各地继续移栽抢种加强田间管理
    本报讯　河北省今年种秋菜面积已达四百多万亩，比往年扩大一倍多。目前，全省正抓紧时间继续移栽、抢种，同时加强了秋菜田间管理。
    今年的秋菜种的快而且多，这是由于公社认真贯彻执行了集体种和个人种相结合的方针。进度最快的邯郸地区，现在已完成种植计划的149％，其中社员个人利用闲散土地栽种的秋菜近三十万亩。历年来种秋菜很少的坝上张北地区，在贯彻了集体种和个人种两条腿走路的方针，已播种秋菜六万多亩。
    现在，全省各公社正加强秋菜的田间管理。许多公社的大白菜、萝卜等已经定苗，并且中耕过二、三遍，开始追肥，放开大叶正常生长。有些公社千方百计为秋菜积肥，如昌黎县安山公社开展“每户攒一桶大粪”运动，解决了一千多亩秋菜缺肥的问题。发生虫灾的地区，正大力进行防治。
    各地在“多种一分是一分，种了就比不种强”的口号下，还在继续种和移栽秋菜。　（李朴）
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省各地秋菜播种工作胜利结束。今年全省共种植秋菜二百九十三万八千亩，播种面积比去年扩大了2.3％。目前，种得早的白菜、萝卜已生出四个至五个叶子，长有四寸多高。各地农民正加强田间管理，争取秋菜丰收。
    黑龙江省各地从7月10日开始了紧张的秋菜播种工作，许多城市的职工、驻军、居民都参加了抢种秋菜的活动，因此，种得快，种得好。今年，各地在秋菜播种前，一般准备工作都比较充分；播种后又注意加强田间管理。佳木斯市一千四百多亩菜地普遍整翻了三遍以上；采取点种的面积比去年增加三倍到九倍。哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等八个城市七十多万亩秋菜地施底肥平均量达到六千斤，比去年增加33％。今年秋菜灌水面积也有了扩大。
    黑龙江今年在秋菜生产中，机关、厂矿、部队、企业、学校等单位，自给性蔬菜生产面积有很大的发展。据哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江等八个城市的统计，机关单位种菜面积达到十二万亩，比去年增加一倍还多。
    据新华社讯　辽宁省秋菜播种工作已经胜利结束，播种面积比去年增加了70％。目前，菜苗已达二、三寸高，放出五、六个嫩叶，普遍苗全、苗齐、苗壮、苗旺，广大菜农为了力争秋菜大丰收，正在大力加强秋菜田间管理。
    今年，秋菜播种不仅动手早、行动快，而且播种质量也比往年好。占78％的蔬菜面积，都是在“立秋”以前种完的。播种秋菜的土地一般都经过了深翻、耙压施肥，水源也很充足。盖平县今年秋菜播种面积比去年增加一倍，各公社为了全部做到适时播种，根据公社人力、物力条件，全面安排了农活，每天有三万多人抢种秋菜。鞍山市沙河人民公社除集中农业劳动力突击抢种蔬菜以外，还暂时从社办工业中抽调三百五十多人，支援了种菜工作，全社二千多亩秋菜面积仅仅十天时间就超额完成了。除此以外，各市近郊的蔬菜公社在播种中还得到了城市工人、干部和市民的大力支援。社与社、队与队之间广泛展开大协作，也都大大加快了秋菜播种进度。
