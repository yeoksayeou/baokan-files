Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - China's coal industry, whose output already exceeded that of Britain last year, has created brilliant achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. As of September 20th, the national coal output this year has reached a cumulative total of more than 245 million tons, an increase of 73% over the same period last year. Based on the current production level, China's coal output will definitely exceed the planned 335 million tons by the end of this year. This figure is equal to 10.3 times China's raw coal output in 1949, and is only tens of millions of tons away from the United States' coal output in 1958.

In the year the People's Republic of China was founded, China's annual coal output was 32.43 million tons, only 14.8% of Britain's output in the same year and 7.4% of the United States' output in the same year, ranking ninth in the world. But by 1958, China's raw coal output had reached 270 million tons, surpassing the old British imperialism by more than 50 million tons and leaping to third place in the world. This year, while China's coal output is continuing to leap forward, Britain's coal output in the first half of the year decreased by about 4% compared with the same period last year. The United States' coal output has also been stagnant for a long time. According to figures published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. coal production index in the first half of this year was only three-quarters of the average level of ten years ago (1947 to 1949); due to the steel workers' strike and the reduction in coal used by the steel industry, coal output in July decreased by 24% compared with June.

Despite the extreme hatred of the imperialist masters for China's socialist construction, they satirized China's fighting slogan of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other major products as a "distant goal," saying that "horses cannot grow wings." However, facts speak louder than words, and the brilliant achievements of China's coal industry and other aspects have long given them a resounding slap in the face.

In just ten years, China has been able to increase its coal output from 32.43 million tons to 335 million tons this year, which is indeed a miracle that has never occurred in the world, like "a horse growing wings." In old China, from the time Li Hongzhang established the first pair of modernized mines in Kaiping (now Kailuan Coal Mine) in 1878 until before liberation, China's highest annual raw coal output (1942) only reached 61.88 million tons. Britain's annual coal output in history has never reached 300 million tons. Even the most powerful country in the capitalist world, the United States, took more than thirty years to increase its coal output from more than 30 million tons to more than 300 million tons.

The rapid development of China's coal output is inseparable from the large-scale basic construction of coal mines since the founding of the country. By the end of 1958, China had started construction, reconstruction, and restoration of more than 600 pairs of mine shafts, with a total designed capacity of more than 220 million tons. In 1949, only eight coal mines in China had an annual output of more than one million tons; and there was not a single coal mine with an annual output of more than ten million tons. Now, China has 55 large-scale coal mines with an annual output of more than one million tons, of which seven coal mines, including Fushun, Fuxin, Kailuan, Huainan, Datong, Hegang, and Jixi, can reach an output of more than ten million tons this year.

In old China, the vast majority of the coal industry was concentrated in the Northeast and North China. After ten years of construction, this situation has begun to change. Currently, nine of the sixteen new large-scale coal mine bases under construction in China are located in East China, Central China, South China, and Northwest China, where the original coal mine foundation was relatively weak. Some of the original old coal mines in these areas have undergone large-scale reconstruction and expansion in recent years. For example, the new mine shafts that have been started and built in the Tongchuan Coal Mine in the Weibei Coalfield from 1954 to the present have a production capacity that is 27 times greater than the highest annual output in the mine's history. The production capacity of the mine shafts under construction and already put into production in the Nantong and Yongrong mines in the Southwest region has also reached 3.3 million tons and 2.42 million tons, respectively.

In 1958, China's coal industry implemented a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies and launched a vigorous mass movement of "stockpiling grain and gathering grass for the steel marshal," which enabled China's coal industry to achieve an unprecedented harvest. In that year alone, local coal mines (including small coal kilns run by counties and people's communes) produced more than 110 million tons of raw coal, and the coal output of central coal mine enterprises also increased by 67% compared with 1957. The large increase in raw coal production in 1958 not only strongly supported the needs of steel and other industries and civilian coal, but also laid a strong foundation for the continued leap forward of the coal industry this year.

Over the past ten years, China has carried out a series of production reforms in old coal mines, which has fundamentally changed the backwardness of the coal industry left over from old China. Before liberation, the backward coal mining methods of indiscriminate digging and mining adopted by imperialism and bureaucratic capital for plundering resources and extracting exorbitant profits have all been abolished; now, advanced coal mining methods such as longwall, horizontal layering, and metal shield supports are generally adopted in various mines. Before liberation, China's coal mine equipment was simple and the technology was backward. Even in the largest coal mines in the country, such as Kailuan and Fushun, coal was mostly mined by hand pickaxes, and the working conditions were very harsh. After liberation, the state has successively equipped various coal mines with a large number of combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, electric drills, pneumatic drills, pneumatic picks, and various transportation machinery and ventilation equipment, which not only improved labor productivity, extended the life of the mine, and saved resources, but also greatly improved the working conditions of workers. At present, the degree of mechanization of coal mining in China's state-owned coal mines (including drilling and blasting) has reached 97%, and the degree of mechanization of underground roadway and working face transportation has also increased to more than 90%. With the development of mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements, many coal mines have also adopted the world's most advanced coal mining technology - hydraulic coal mining. In the past year and the first half of this year alone, twelve pairs of mine shafts with fully hydraulic (including hydraulic lifting, hydraulic transportation, and hydraulic coal mining) have been built across the country, and more than 60 working faces in 25 coal mines have implemented hydraulic coal mining. This year, the output of hydraulic coal mining will reach more than 8 million tons. (Attached picture)

    把英国抛在后面　跃居世界第三位
    我国煤产量十年猛增十倍
    新华社23日讯　去年产量已经超过英国的我国煤炭工业，今年又创造了辉煌的成就迎接建国十周年。到9月20日止，全国今年煤炭产量累计已达二亿四千五百多万吨，比去年同期增长73％。按照现在的生产水平计算，到今年年底，我国煤炭产量肯定将会超过计划规定的三亿三千五百万吨。这个数字等于1949年我国原煤产量的十点三倍，距离美国1958年的煤产量，也只差几千万吨。
    中华人民共和国成立的那年，我国煤炭年产量为三千二百四十三万吨，只及英国同年产量的14.8％，美国同年产量的7.4％，居于世界第九位。可是到1958年，我国的原煤产量就达到了二亿七千万吨，以多五千万吨之数把老牌英帝国主义抛在后面，而跃居为世界第三位。今年，当我国煤炭产量正在继续跃进的时候，英国上半年煤产量却比去年同期下降了4％左右。美国的煤产量也是长期停滞不前。据美国商务部公布的数字，今年上半年美国煤的生产指数只及十年前（1947年到1949年）平均水平的四分之三；由于钢铁工人大罢工，钢铁工业用煤减少，7月份煤产量又比6月份下降了24％。
    尽管帝国主义老爷们对我国的社会主义建设极端仇视，讽刺我国在钢铁及其他主要产品产量方面赶上或超过英国的战斗口号是“遥远的目标”，说什么“马不能长翅膀”。但是，事实胜于雄辩，我国煤炭工业及其他各方面的辉煌成就，早就打了他们响亮的耳光。
    在短短十年内，我国能够把煤炭产量从三千二百四十三万吨提高到今年的三亿三千五百万吨，这的确是一个“像马长了翅膀”一样的全世界没有出现过的奇迹。旧中国从1878年李鸿章在开平（现在的开滦煤矿）开办第一对近代化矿井起，直到解放前，我国最高原煤年产量（1942年）才达到过六千一百八十八万吨。英国历史上的煤炭年产量从来没有达到过三亿吨。即使是资本主义世界中最强大的美国，它的煤产量从三千多万吨上升到三亿多吨，也足足用了三十多年。
    我国煤炭产量的飞跃发展，是与建国以来所进行的大规模的煤矿基本建设分不开的。到1958年底，我国共计动工新建、改建和恢复了六百多对矿井，总设计能力达两亿二千多万吨。1949年，我国只有八个煤矿的年产量达到一百万吨以上；年产一千万吨以上的煤矿一个也没有。而现在，我国已拥有五十五处年产量超过一百万吨的大型煤矿，其中今年产量可以达到一千万吨以上的，就有抚顺、阜新、开滦、淮南、大同、鹤岗和鸡西七个煤矿。
    旧中国煤炭工业绝大部分集中在东北和华北。经过十年建设，现在这种情况也已经开始有所改变。目前我国正在建设的十六个新的大型煤矿基地，就有九个分布在原来煤矿基础比较薄弱的华东、华中、华南和西北地区。这些地区原有的一些旧煤矿，最近几年来都进行了大规模的改建和扩建。如渭北煤田上的铜川煤矿，仅1954年到现在开工兴建的新矿井生产能力，就比这个矿历史上最高年产量还大二十七倍。西南区的南桐和永荣两矿，目前正在建设和已经投入生产的矿井生产能力，也已分别达到三百三十万吨和二百四十二万吨。
    1958年，我国煤炭工业贯彻执行了一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，掀起了“为钢铁元帅囤粮聚草”的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，使我国的煤炭工业得到了空前未有的丰收。这一年，仅是地方煤矿（包括县和人民公社办的小煤窑）就生产了一亿一千多万吨原煤，中央煤矿企业的煤炭产量，也比1957年增长了67％。1958年的原煤大增产，不但有力地支援了钢铁及其他工业和民用煤的需要，还为煤炭工业今年继续跃进奠定了强大的基础。
    十年来，我国对旧有的煤矿进行了一系列的生产改革工作，使旧中国遗留下来的煤炭工业落后面貌得以根本改观。解放以前，帝国主义和官僚资本为掠夺资源、榨取暴利而采用各种乱挖乱采的落后的采煤方法已经全部废除；现在各矿普遍采用了长壁式、水平分层、金属掩护支架等先进的采煤法。解放以前，我国煤矿设备简陋，技术落后，即使像开滦、抚顺等全国最大的煤矿，也大都采用手镐刨煤，劳动条件非常恶劣。解放以后，国家先后为各煤矿装备了大量的联合采煤机、截煤机、电钻、风钻、风镐和各种运输机械、通风设备，不仅提高了劳动生产率、延长了矿井寿命和节约了资源，还大大改善了工人的劳动条件。目前，我国国营煤矿的采煤机械化程度（包括打眼放炮）已达97％，井下巷道和工作面运输机械化程度也已提高到90％以上。随着群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，许多煤矿还采用了世界上最先进的采煤技术——水力采煤。仅去年和今年上半年，全国就建成了十二对全部水力化（包括水力提升、水力运输、水力采煤）的矿井，在二十五个煤矿里还有六十多个工作面实行了水力采煤。今年水力采煤的产量将达八百多万吨。（附图片）
