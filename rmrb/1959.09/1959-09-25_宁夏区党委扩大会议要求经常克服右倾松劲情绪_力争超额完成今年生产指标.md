    Ningxia Regional Party Committee Enlarged Meeting Requires Frequent Overcoming of Right-Leaning Complacency
    Striving to Exceed This Year's Production Targets
    (By this newspaper) The Enlarged Meeting of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, began on August 23rd and ended on September 14th. This meeting was a mobilization rally to implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and strive to fulfill and over fulfill this year's production and construction plans. It was a promotion conference to continue to deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy and to oppose right-leaning tendencies and encourage greater effort throughout the region.
    The meeting listened to the transmission of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and earnestly studied the resolutions and relevant documents of the Eighth Plenary Session, giving the attendees a profound education. The meeting unanimously agreed that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was of great historical significance. The Central Committee's analysis of the current situation and its resolutions on opposing right-leaning tendencies, encouraging greater effort, and continuing to develop the movement to increase production and practice economy are completely correct and timely, pointing out a clear future for the development of all undertakings and adding tremendous impetus to current and future work. After studying the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and examining and criticizing right-leaning thoughts, the comrades attending the meeting improved their ideological understanding, strengthened their confidence in implementing the General Line, consolidating and improving the people's communes, and continuing the Great Leap Forward. They further clarified the importance of enhancing Party spirit training, strengthening political study, thoroughly transforming their thinking, firmly establishing a proletarian standpoint, and using the methods of class analysis to view and handle problems. On the basis of analyzing and recognizing the favorable situation, and under the guidance of the thought of exerting great effort and striving for the top, they solved some of the main problems in the current work and initially formulated the main indicators for the region's production and construction next year. Therefore, the comrades attending the meeting are determined to respond with redoubled efforts to the Central Committee's great call to complete the main indicators of the Second Five-Year Plan this year, to catch up with Britain in terms of the output of major industrial products in about ten years, and to complete and over fulfill the National Program for Agricultural Development in twelve years ahead of schedule.
    The meeting believes that the current situation in the Autonomous Region is very good, and all production and construction are continuing to leap forward. In agriculture, the entire region is experiencing a medium to high bumper year, with only about 10% of the area affected by severe water, drought, and hail disasters. The total output of wheat increased by 12.5% compared to last year, and the total output of autumn grains is expected to increase by more than 10%. As of the end of August, industrial production has completed 73.8% of the annual industrial output value, capital construction has completed 45.7% of the annual investment amount, and transportation tasks have completed 58.7% of the annual plan. As of September 10th, 81.8% of the grain transfer task for the third quarter has been completed. Savings deposits have been rising month by month since June. Commodity sales in August decreased by 3.2% compared to July, inventory increased, and the market is stable. The relationship between cadres and the masses and the relationship between urban and rural strata are very good. In particular, after implementing the Central Committee's instructions on opposing right-leaning tendencies and the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, the enthusiasm of workers and farmers has become even higher, and great achievements have been made in industrial and agricultural production.
    The meeting pointed out that this year's production targets can be completely over fulfilled. In agriculture: as long as the autumn harvest is done well, ensuring that every grain returns home, it is possible to harvest a few or even a dozen more catties of grain per mu. While ensuring the over fulfillment of this year's production increase task, efforts should be made to accumulate fertilizer and turn over the soil to prepare for a bumper harvest next year. After the autumn harvest, the central task of agricultural production should be immediately shifted to striving for a bumper harvest next year. In order to complete the above tasks, it is necessary to fully utilize all favorable conditions, rationally organize labor, and grasp specific measures to promote the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In industry: the total output value this year should exceed the original plan by 15%, raw coal should be increased by 8.9% compared to the original plan, pig iron should be increased by 15% compared to the original plan, and capital construction should strive to complete the annual capital construction task. In finance and trade: first of all, the collection and unified purchase and sale of grain and oil should be done well. At the same time, it is also necessary to seize the acquisition of agricultural, sideline, and local products, expand the commodity rate of agricultural products as much as possible, support industrialization, and increase the income of commune members. Transportation is an important link related to the completion of the current tasks of increasing production and practicing economy in industry, agriculture, and commerce. First of all, the potential of modern transportation tools must be fully utilized and the loading and unloading work must be grasped. At the same time, the transportation force of the communes should be actively organized to carry out a mass short-distance transportation movement. While striving to increase production, it is also necessary to practice strict economy, especially the economy of grain. It is necessary to repeatedly and deeply educate all the people on building the country diligently and thriftily, running the communes diligently and thriftily, managing households diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily.
    The meeting believes that in order to ensure the completion of various tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, and deeply develop the socialist labor emulation.
    In order to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, it is necessary to do a good job of the regular consolidation and improvement of the people's communes. This winter and spring, a systematic rectification movement should be carried out within the Autonomous Region. In addition, all localities must earnestly do a good job in developing Party members and members of the Communist Youth League.
    The meeting believes that opposing right-leaning thoughts and strengthening Party spirit are the keys to implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and improving the work of the Autonomous Region. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must always pay attention to overcoming right-leaning complacency in their work and oppose right-leaning thoughts. Educate all Party members and cadres to enhance Party spirit training.

    宁夏区党委扩大会议要求经常克服右倾松劲情绪
    力争超额完成今年生产指标
    本报讯　中共宁夏回族自治区委员会扩大会议，从8月23日开始，到9月14日结束。这次会议，是贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议，争取完成与超额完成今年生产建设计划的誓师大会，是在全区范围内继续深入开展增产节约运动，反右倾、鼓干劲的促进大会。
    会议听取了党的八届八中全会精神的传达，认真学习了八中全会的决议和有关文件，使到会人员受到了一次深刻的教育。会议一致认为，党的八届八中全会具有伟大的历史意义。中央关于当前形势的分析和反右倾、鼓干劲、继续开展增产节约运动的决议，是完全正确的、适时的，给各项事业的发展指出了明确前途，给当前和今后工作增加了巨大的动力。到会同志在学习了八中全会决议和检查批判了右倾思想后，提高了思想认识，坚定了贯彻执行总路线、巩固提高人民公社和继续跃进的信心，进一步明确了增强党性锻炼、加强政治学习、彻底改造思想、坚定无产阶级立场和运用阶级分析的方法看问题、处理问题的重要性，并在分析认识有利形势的基础上，在鼓足干劲、力争上游的指导思想下，解决了当前工作中的一些主要问题，初步拟定了明年自治区生产建设的主要指标。因而到会同志决心以加倍的努力，响应中央关于在今年内完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，在十年左右的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国和大大提前完成和超额完成十二年全国农业发展纲要的伟大号召。
    会议认为，目前自治区的形势很好，各项生产建设都在继续跃进。农业上全区是中上丰收年，严重的水、旱、雹灾的受灾面积不过10％左右。小麦总产量比去年增长12.5％，秋粮总产量预计可以增长10％以上。截至8月底，工业生产已经完成全年工业总产值的73.8％，基本建设完成年投资额的45.7％，运输任务完成了年计划的58.7％。第三季度粮食上调任务，到9月10日已经完成81.8％。储蓄存款6月份以来逐月上升。8月份商品销售量比7月份减少3.2％，货物库存增加，市场稳定。干部和群众的关系、城乡各阶层的关系很好。特别是贯彻了中央关于反右倾指示和八中全会决议以后，工人农民的干劲更加高涨，工农业生产上取得了很大成绩。
    会议指出，今年的生产指标完全有条件争取超额完成。农业方面：只要作好秋收，做到颗粒还家，每亩多收几斤甚至十几斤粮食是可能的。在保证超额完成今年增产任务的同时，应抓紧积肥、翻地，作好争取明年大丰收的准备。秋收以后立即把农业生产的中心任务转到争取明年大丰收上去。为了完成上述任务，必须充分利用一切有利条件，合理组织劳力，抓紧具体措施，推动农林牧副渔全面发展。工业方面：今年总产值要超过原定计划15％，原煤比原计划提高8.9％；生铁比原计划提高15％；基本建设要力争完成全年基建任务。财贸方面：首先要搞好粮食、油料的征收和统购、统销。同时，还要抓紧农、副产品和土特产收购，尽可能扩大农产品的商品率，支持工业化，增加社员收入。交通运输是关系到完成当前工业、农业和商业等增产节约任务的重要环节，首先要充分发挥现代运输工具的潜力，抓紧装卸工作。同时要积极组织公社运输力量，开展群众性的短途运输运动。在努力增产的同时，还必须厉行节约，特别是粮食的节约。要向全体人民反复深入地进行勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家、勤俭办一切事业的教育。
    会议认为，为了保证各项任务的完成，必须加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，深入开展社会主义劳动竞赛。
    为了充分发挥人民公社的优越性，必须做好人民公社的经常的巩固和提高工作，今冬明春在自治区范围内，还要开展一次系统的整社运动。此外，各地还必须认真作好发展党员、团员的工作。
    会议认为，反对右倾思想，增强党性，是贯彻八届八中全会精神，改进自治区工作的关键。因此，各级党委必须经常注意克服工作中的右倾松劲情绪，反对右倾思想。教育全体党员和干部，增强党性锻炼。
