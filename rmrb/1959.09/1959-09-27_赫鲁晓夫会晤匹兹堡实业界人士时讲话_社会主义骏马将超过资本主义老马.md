Xinhua News Agency, Pittsburgh, September 25th: According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev delivered a speech on the 24th of September in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at a meeting with American industrialists and social figures.

Khrushchev said that your country has reached a high level of industrial development. In terms of the speed and strength of development, you have not had a worthy opponent in the past. Now, such an opponent has emerged, and that is the Soviet Union.

Now, we have caught up with your country in some respects. Figuratively speaking, our whistles are already echoing yours. You will hear our whistles getting louder and louder, and closer and closer. They will sound louder year by year. The day is not far off when we will catch up with you at the same station, greet you, and continue forward. It won't be us following behind you, but you following behind us.

Please do not blame me for being convinced that this is how things will develop. We are prepared to compete on such a lofty stage as guaranteeing the material and cultural needs of the people.

You probably know that the Soviet Union is now the second largest industrial power in the world. By the way, your country was also the second strongest power before becoming the first. You also think this is completely natural. Why do some of your compatriots think it is impossible or even unacceptable when we propose the task of leaping from second to first place? We are seriously preparing to compete with your country. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy has aroused great interest throughout the world. I can tell you that judging from the first year of the seven-year plan and the projections for 1960, our industrial production will grow even more than originally planned. Thus, according to our estimates, the tasks set by the seven-year plan will be overfulfilled, and the plan will be completed ahead of schedule.

Khrushchev said that the people of our two countries do not want war. Then, let us treat each other as good neighbors, and let us base our relations on the principles of peaceful coexistence. This principle will not give anyone a unilateral advantage, and no one will suffer any loss or sacrifice as a result, but everyone will benefit from it. And most importantly, the cause of peace will benefit from it.

A good start has already been made—mutual visits at the highest level are underway. We are convinced that my visit to the United States and the future visit of the American President to the Soviet Union will definitely help to better familiarize and understand each other, and help find a path to cooperation. If both of us have this sincerity, we will definitely find the way.

Khrushchev said, "Catching up with and surpassing the United States" has now become a very popular slogan in our country. This slogan has even frightened some of your compatriots, who think this slogan is a threat to the United States. But, what "threat" is this slogan to you Americans? I assure you that the direction of our seven-year plan is peaceful. Our plan is to improve people's lives.

We live with you in a very complex international situation, although glimmers of dawn occasionally appear in the cloudy sky. In a tense situation, the "cold war" can easily turn into a hot war, and a very hot one—a nuclear war. The most reliable way to avoid this bad prospect is to eliminate the means of waging war, that is, to "beat swords into plowshares." We advocate universally and permanently declaring the "cold war" illegal.

However, some people are concerned about the exact opposite. They are afraid that without military orders, peaceful production will not bring them profits. They are worried that stopping the production of armaments and switching to a peaceful track will constantly put industry and the entire economy in a state of fever and chills. However, this sentiment is due to shortsightedness. The principle of these people's lives is to see no further than their own noses. In fact, if things were to develop to the point of using the weapons now being manufactured, then in the flames of war, not only would the profits accumulated from the production of armaments vanish, but many, many of the owners of these profits would also turn to ashes.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union and the United States have a special responsibility for maintaining peace. He said that there are no serious obstacles hindering peaceful and friendly relations between our two countries. Of course, there are ideological differences between our two countries, but these differences are not obstacles. Even during the Second World War, these differences existed, but they did not prevent us from being good friends. Now, they should not hinder the union of our forces in the struggle for lasting world peace. We are pleased that even here, in the United States, people with realistic ideas are inclined to this proposition. The more such people there are, the better.

Khrushchev said that mutual visits and our talks on the international situation and Soviet-American relations are beneficial not only to our two countries, but also to all other countries.

Khrushchev said that Pittsburgh and the residents of this city have left us with a very good impression. We are very satisfied with the way the citizens of your beautiful city have treated us Soviets, satisfied with their enthusiasm and hospitality, and mainly satisfied with their understanding of the significance of my visit to the United States, and their understanding of the need to improve relations between our two countries.

Khrushchev said, ladies and gentlemen, you like your capitalist system. And we very much like the socialist system created by our people. What can we do if you like capitalism? God bless you, let you live under the capitalist system, and let you continue to ride your old horse. And we are riding a newborn, energetic socialist steed, and we will more easily catch up with and surpass you. However, this is a matter of economic competition between two systems. If we all embark on the path of peaceful competition, the people of all countries will benefit from this, because there will be no more wars between countries, and people will no longer shed blood (applause).

Khrushchev then said to Pennsylvania Governor Lawrence, Mr. Governor, you said at the end that the people of your country unanimously support the government's policies, and the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States are completely united in maintaining and supporting their own system and country, and they support the President and the foreign policy he implements.

This statement can have two meanings. I would like to talk about what I think this speech can be interpreted as. One meaning might be: Listen, Khrushchev, take a look! (Laughter throughout the hall) We have two parties, but we are united.

Heaven knows what the differences are between your two parties, I can't see any difference between them. But, there may also be this hint in the Governor's speech: Khrushchev, you are going to talk to our President tomorrow. We support our President: you must be firm, do not waver, we support you.

To this I can say to you: our Soviet people are of one mind, they are united around their own Communist Party, support their beloved party, and they think this party is the best party in the world. Our one Communist Party is better than your two (joyful activity throughout the hall). This is my opinion. And what do you want, do you want me to say that your party is good? If I thought so, I would join one of them (laughter).

Our people support their Soviet government. When I came to the United States, many people said to me, just as you said to your President: Comrade Khrushchev, go to the United States and strive for peace and friendship with the American people and the American government, but stand firm (joyful activity throughout the hall).

If things are treated so simply, if we all stick to irreconcilable positions—I stick to mine, and the American President sticks to his own—then our talks tomorrow will not be pragmatic. It will not be a meeting that seeks wise solutions, but only stubbornness, like two bulls butting heads: whoever has harder legs, whoever has a harder forehead, whoever has longer horns, then whose horns will pierce the other first.

Do the Soviet people, the American people, the people of all countries want us to do this? Your legs are very hard, and our legs are not soft either. Therefore, let us compete in solving disputes with reason, not with force. This is what the people of all countries expect of us (applause).

I am happy to talk to the head of state who is supported, respected, and loved by his own people (applause).

Khrushchev finally said, Mr. Governor, I would like to interpret your words in this way: this is indeed the American people's trust and love for your President, and their hope that he will seek wise arguments in his talks with me, so that we can work together to find mutually acceptable solutions to truly guarantee mutual understanding and friendly relations between our two countries, and to guarantee harmony between our two countries and all countries.

I also came to the United States with this trust from my people and my government. I will follow this trust to meet and talk with your esteemed President Eisenhower.

If our two countries establish trust in each other to replace distrust, and if we unite our forces to fight for strengthening peace for ourselves and for everyone, then the people of the whole world will support us (long and continuous applause, everyone stands up).

### 赫鲁晓夫会晤匹兹堡实业界人士时讲话  社会主义骏马将超过资本主义老马

    赫鲁晓夫会晤匹兹堡实业界人士时讲话
    社会主义骏马将超过资本主义老马
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社匹兹堡25日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫24日在匹兹堡市（宾夕法尼亚州）同美国实业界和社会人士会晤时发表了讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，贵国在工业发展方面已经达到高度的水平，在发展速度和实力上，你们过去没有一个有资格的对手。现在，这样的对手有了，这就是苏联。
    现在，我们已经在某些方面赶上了贵国。如果形象地说，我们的汽笛声已经和你们相呼应了。你们会听到我们的汽笛声愈来愈响，愈来愈近。它一年比一年听起来更响亮。这样的日子已经不远了：我们在同一个车站赶上你们、向你们打个招呼并继续前进。不是我们跟在你们后头，而是你们跟在我们后头。
    请不要因为我坚信事情的发展将正是这样而责难我。我们准备在保证人民的物质和文化需要这样的崇高舞台上展开竞赛。
    你们大概知道，现在苏联已经是世界上第二个工业强国了。顺便说说，就是贵国以前也曾经是第二强国，而以后才成为第一强国的。你们也认为这是完全自然的事情。为什么当我们提出要从第二位跃到第一位这样一个任务时，你们的某些同胞竟认为是不可能的甚至是不能允许的呢。我们认真地准备同贵国较量一下。苏联发展国民经济的七年计划引起全世界极大的兴趣。我可以告诉你们，从七年计划的第一年的情况和1960年的预计看来，我们的工业生产将比原定计划有更大的增长。这样，据我们估计，七年计划提出的任务将超额完成，而计划将提前完成。
    赫鲁晓夫说，贵我两国人民都不希望战争。那么，就让我们以睦邻相待吧，让我们以和平共处的原则作为我们两国关系的基础吧。这种原则不会给人以单方面的优势，谁也不会因此而受到什么损失或者牺牲，但是大家都会因此而得到好处。而最主要的是，和平事业将因此而得到好处。
    已经打开了一个良好的开端——双方正在进行最高级的互访。我们深信，我的访美和美国总统未来的访苏一定会有助于更好地互相熟悉和更好地互相了解，有助于找到合作的道路。如果我们双方都有这种诚意，就一定会找到道路。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“赶上并超过美国”，现在已经成了我国的一句非常流行的口号。这个口号甚至吓坏了你们的一些同胞，他们认为这个口号对美国是一个威胁。但是，这种口号对你们美国人有什么“威胁”呢？我向你们保证，我们七年计划的方向是和平的方向。我们的计划是为了改善人们的生活。
    我们同你们生活在非常复杂的国际局势中，虽然在阴云密布的天空中不时也出现曙光。在紧张局势下，“冷战”会很容易地变成为热战，并且是温度很高的热战——核战争。要避免这种不好的前景，最可靠的道路就是消灭进行战争的手段，即“把剑熔铸为耕犁”。我们主张普遍永远宣布“冷战”为非法。
    可是，有些人所操心的恰恰是相反的东西。他们害怕，如果没有军事订货，和平生产不会给他们带来利润。他们忧虑的是，停止军火生产并转到和平轨道上来，将会不断地使工业和整个经济处在寒热病的状态中。但是，这种情绪是由于目光短浅而产生的。这些人生活的原则是看不到比自己鼻子更远的地方。实际上，如果事情竟发展到要使用现在制造的那种武器，那末，在战火中，不仅从生产军火所积累起来的利润会化为乌有，而且这种利润的所有者有很多很多人也要化为灰烬。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏美两国对维护和平负有特殊责任，他说，任何阻碍我们两国和平友好相处的严重障碍都不存在。当然，在我们两国之间有着意识形态上的分歧，但是这种分歧不是障碍。就是在第二次世界大战时期，这种分歧也是有的，而它们并没有阻碍我们成为好朋友。现在，在争取世界持久和平的斗争中它们也不应阻碍我们的力量的联合。我们感到高兴的是，就是在这里，在美国，有现实思想的人都倾向于这种主张。这样的人越多越好。
    赫鲁晓夫说，相互访问和我们就国际局势以及苏美关系问题进行会谈，不仅对我们两国，而且对所有其他国家都是有好处的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫说，匹兹堡和这个城市的居民给我们留下了非常好的印象。我们非常满意你们这个美丽城市的市民这样对待我们苏联人，满意他们对我们的热情和殷勤的款待，而主要是满意他们了解我访美的意义，了解必须改善我们两国的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，各位先生，你们是喜欢你们的资本主义制度的。而我们却非常喜欢我们人民创造的社会主义制度。你们喜欢资本主义，那有什么办法呢？上帝保佑你们吧，就让你们生活在资本主义制度下吧，就让你们继续骑着自己的老马走吧。而我们骑的是新生的、精力充沛的社会主义骏马，我们将更容易赶上和超过你们。但是，这是两个体系经济竞赛的问题。如果我们都走上和平竞赛的道路，各国人民都会因此受到好处，因为各国之间就不会再有战争，人们就不会再流血了（掌声）。
    赫鲁晓夫接着对宾夕法尼亚州州长劳伦斯说，州长先生，您在最后谈到，贵国人民一致支持政府的政策，美国的共和党和民主党在维护和支持本国的制度和国家方面表现完全一致，它们支持总统和他所执行的外交政策。
    这种说法可以有两种意义。我想谈谈我认为这个讲话能够作什么解释。一个意思可能是：你听听，赫鲁晓夫，你瞧瞧！ （全场笑声）我们有两个党，但是我们是一致的。
    天晓得，你们两党之间究竟有什么不同之处，我看不出他们之间有什么差别。但是，在州长先生的发言中可能也有这种暗示：赫鲁晓夫，你明天就要同我们总统交谈了。我们在支持我们的总统：你要坚定，不要动摇，我们支持你。
    对于这一点我可以这样对你们说：我们苏联人民是万众一心的，他们团结在自己的共产党的周围，支持自己亲爱的党，他们认为这个党是世界上最好的党。我们的一个共产党比你们的两个还好（全场欢乐的活跃）。这是我的见解。而你们希望什么，希望我说你们的党好吗？如果我是这样想的，我就会加入其中的一个党了（笑声）。
    我国人民支持自己的苏联政府。当我来美国的时候，许多人就像你们对你们的总统说的那样对我说：赫鲁晓夫同志，到美国去吧，争取同美国人民和美国政府取得和平和友谊，但是要站得稳（全场欢乐的活跃）。
    如果是这样简单化地对待事情，如果我们都坚持不调和的立场——我坚持我的，而美国总统坚持他自己的——那我们明天的会谈就不会是实事求是的。就不会是寻求明智的解决办法的会谈，而只是顽固不化，打个譬喻说，就像两头公牛顶架：谁的腿硬，谁的额头硬，谁的角长，那谁的角就最先扎穿对方。
    难道苏联人民、美国人民、各国人民希望我们这样做吗？你们的腿很硬，我们的腿也不软。因此让我们在用理智而不是用武力来解决争执问题上较量较量。这是所有国家的人民对我们的期望（掌声）。
    我乐于同一位受到本国人民支持、尊重和爱戴的国家首脑进行会谈（掌声）。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，州长先生，我想对您的话作这样的解释：这的确是美国人民对你们的总统的信任和爱戴，是希望他在同我的会谈中寻求明智的论据，以便我们能共同努力找到相互能够接受的解决办法，来真正地保证我们两国之间的相互谅解和友好关系，保证我们两国以及一切国家之间的和睦。
    我也是带着本国人民和本国政府的这种信任来到美国的。我将遵循着这种信任同你们尊敬的总统艾森豪威尔先生会晤和会谈。
    如果我们两国彼此建立起信任关系来代替不信任，如果我们把自己的力量联合起来，为加强自己和所有人的和平而斗争，那末全世界的人民都会支持我们（经久不息的掌声，全体起立）。
