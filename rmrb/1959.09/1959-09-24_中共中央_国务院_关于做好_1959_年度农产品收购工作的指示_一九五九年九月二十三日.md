The year 1958 saw an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in national industrial and agricultural production, and this year it continues to leap forward. Currently, inspired by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, the people of the whole country are carrying out a vigorous movement to combat Right-leaning sentiments, boost morale, increase production and practice economy. In terms of agricultural production, after achieving a great victory in the fight against disasters, the vast number of peasants are making every effort to strengthen the late-stage field management of autumn crops, forming a magnificent movement for agricultural overproduction. In most parts of the country, autumn crops such as grain, oil, cotton, tobacco, and hemp can expect a bumper harvest. Industrial production is also leaping forward on an even larger scale. This is a very favorable situation. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council believe that making full use of the current favorable situation, relying on the enthusiasm of the masses, and doing the best job of procuring agricultural products such as grain, oil, cotton, tobacco, and hemp this year is a key to appropriately meeting the needs of rapidly growing industrial raw materials and urban and rural markets, and it is a glorious and significant task for all rural state workers and all peasants.

At present, early autumn crops are beginning to enter the market, and a large number of middle and late autumn crops are about to appear. The peak season for agricultural product procurement is approaching. In order to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and to fulfill and overfulfill the state procurement tasks, the following instructions are hereby given:

(1) Make overall plans and comprehensive arrangements, and earnestly strengthen the leadership of agricultural and sideline product procurement work. All rural work must be under the unified leadership of the Party committee, with agricultural production as the center, and with the goals of combating Right-leaning sentiments, boosting morale, and combining production, procurement, and distribution. In terms of agricultural product procurement, grain, oil, and cotton should be the center, and the procurement of various agricultural, sideline, and special local products should be arranged in a coordinated manner, each in its proper place. At the same time, all localities should divide specialized fronts, establish strong offices, and have the responsible Party committee secretary take charge to grasp the procurement work tightly, meticulously, realistically, and well.

(2) It is necessary to uniformly allocate rural labor to complete the tasks of agricultural product procurement, processing, and transfer in a timely manner. The next few months are the busy season for harvesting and planting. Large-scale farmland water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and short-distance transportation campaigns will also be carried out at the same time, and rural labor will be quite tight. Under such circumstances, all localities must fully mobilize and organize all available labor to make overall arrangements and rational allocation. It is necessary to allocate the necessary labor to ensure the timely completion of the tasks of agricultural product procurement, processing, and transfer. For the procurement, processing, and transfer of some agricultural and sideline products, permanent and temporary professional teams should also be comprehensively arranged, organized and established as needed and possible. This is an important issue, and it is hoped that Party committees and governments at all levels will solve it well.

(3) Seize the harvest season of agricultural and sideline products, resolutely achieve careful harvesting, meticulous threshing, picking up leftovers, and cleaning, returning every grain to the home, and achieve quick harvesting, quick threshing and drying, quick procurement, quick processing, and quick transfer, and achieve harvesting, threshing and drying, procurement, processing, and transfer simultaneously. Prepare fully, mobilize quickly, and complete in one go. In short, it is necessary to achieve good harvest, good procurement, good distribution, good storage, and good seed preservation. To do this, it is necessary to adopt the working method of the mass line, rely on the masses to do a good job in the grading and inspection of various agricultural and sideline products; at the same time, it is necessary to correctly implement the state's price policy, adhere to "pricing according to quality," and prevent "downgrading and price suppression." All localities should attach great importance to the processing and transfer of agricultural and sideline products, and make full use of all processing tools and transportation tools in order to process agricultural and sideline products in a timely manner and quickly transfer them to urban industrial and mining areas.

(4) All localities should not only first focus on the procurement of major agricultural products, but also strictly follow the policies of the Party and the state to procure all other useful agricultural and sideline products and local specialties. Procurement work should not only focus on large quantities, but also on small quantities; not only on concentrated products, but also on scattered products; not only on domestic products, but also on wild products. This will not only increase industrial raw materials and market supplies, but also promote the development of diversified operations of people's communes and production teams, and increase the income of peasants.

(5) It is necessary to closely combine procurement and distribution, and closely combine unified purchase and unified sale, and vigorously promote planned consumption and conserve grain. All localities should seize the opportunity to repeatedly educate peasants on running communes and managing households diligently and frugally, and on "how to live," and mobilize peasants to plan their grain consumption and increase reserves to make up for deficiencies in lean years with surpluses in bumper years. It is necessary to prevent the undesirable phenomenon of waste that may grow among peasants after the harvest of large quantities of agricultural products. If this work is done well this autumn and winter, life will be better next year.

(6) While completing the task of agricultural product procurement, commercial departments should do a good job in organizing the supply of means of production and means of livelihood in rural areas. The People's Bank must effectively guarantee the funding needs for agricultural product procurement, correctly carry out the work of recovering agricultural loans due and advance payments for agricultural products from the grain department and the commercial department, and strive to expand rural savings and absorb deposits.

At present, all fronts are combating Right-leaning sentiments, boosting morale, and carrying out a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. The people of the whole country are high in morale and full of spirit. All localities must seize this extremely favorable opportunity, adhere to putting politics in command and the mass line, carry out widespread propaganda and education on the socialist general line to more than 500 million peasants, and further strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. On the basis of fully carrying out political mobilization and ideological work, we should launch a massive agricultural product procurement campaign and comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state's agricultural product procurement tasks for 1959.

    中共中央　国务院  关于做好1959年度农产品收购工作的指示
     一九五九年九月二十三日
    1958年全国工农业生产实现了史无前例的大跃进，今年还在继续跃进。目前，全国人民在中共中央八届八中全会的鼓舞下，正在开展一个轰轰烈烈的反右倾、鼓干劲的增产节约运动。在农业生产方面，广大农民在抗灾斗争取得了伟大胜利以后，正在全力加强秋季作物的后期田间管理，形成了一个波澜壮阔的农业超产运动。全国大部分地区的粮食、油料、棉花、烟叶、麻类等秋季作物可以得到丰收。工业生产也正以更大的规模向前跃进。这是一个十分有利的形势。中共中央和国务院认为，充分运用目前的有利形势，依靠群众的积极性，最好地完成今年粮食、油料、棉花、烟叶、麻类等农产品的收购任务，是适当满足全国迅速增长的工业原料和城乡市场需要的一个关键，是农村全体国家工作人员和全体农民一项光荣的重大的任务。
    目前早秋作物开始上市，大量的中、晚秋作物即将登场，农产品收购的旺季快要来到。为了做好农副产品收购工作，完成和超额完成国家收购任务，现作如下指示：
    （一）统筹兼顾，全面安排，切实加强农副产品收购工作的领导。农村的各项工作，必须在党委统一领导下，以农业生产为中心，反右倾、鼓干劲，做到生产、收购、分配结合进行。在农产品收购方面来说，应该以粮、油、棉为中心，将各种农副土特产品的收购工作统筹安排，各得其所。同时，各地应该划分专门战线，建立有力的办事机构，由主管党委书记挂帅，把收购工作抓紧、抓细、抓实、抓好。
    （二）必须统一调配农村劳动力，及时完成农产品收购、加工和调运任务。今后几个月正是收获、耕种的繁忙季节，大规模的农田水利建设，积肥造肥和短途运输运动也要同时进行，农村劳动力将会相当紧张。在这种情况下，各地必须把一切可以利用的劳动力充分动员和组织起来，进行统筹安排和合理调配。必须调配必要的劳动力来保证农产品收购、加工和调运任务的及时完成。对有些农副产品的采购、加工和调运，还应该根据需要和可能通盘安排，组织和建立经常的和临时的专业队。这是一个重要的问题，望各级党委和政府很好地解决。
    （三）抓紧农副产品的收获季节，坚决做到精收细打拾干拣净、颗粒还家，做到快收割、快打晒、快收购、快加工、快调运，做到边收割、边打晒、边收购、边加工、边调运。充分准备，迅速动员，一气呵成。总之，要做到收获好、收购好、分配好、保管好、留种好。要这样，必须采取群众路线的工作方法，依靠群众做好各种农副产品的分级、检验工作；同时，必须正确贯彻执行国家的价格政策，坚持“依质论价”，防止“压级压价”。对于农副产品的加工和调运工作，各地应该给以极大的重视，把所有的加工工具和运输工具都充分利用起来，以便把农副产品及时加工出来，迅速调给城市工矿区。
      （四）各地不仅要首先抓紧主要农产品的收购，而且要严格地按照党和国家的政策，把其他一切有用的农副产品、土特产品统统收购起来。收购工作不仅要抓大宗的，而且要抓小宗的；不仅要抓集中的，而且要抓分散的；不仅要抓家生的，而且要抓野生的。这样不但可以增加工业原料和市场货源，还可以促进人民公社、生产队多种经营的发展，增加农民的收入。
    （五）要把收购和分配密切结合起来，把统购和统销密切结合起来，大力提倡计划消费，节约用粮。各地要抓紧时机，反复地对农民进行勤俭办社、勤俭持家和“如何过日子”的教育，动员农民计划用粮，增加储备，以丰补歉。要防止农产品大量收获后农民中可能滋长不应有的浪费现象。今年秋冬做好了这项工作，明年的日子就好过。
    （六）在完成农产品收购任务的同时，商业部门应该很好地组织农村生产资料和生活资料的供应。人民银行必须切实保证农产品收购的资金需要，正确地进行到期农贷和粮食部、商业部对于农产品预购定金的收回工作，力求扩大农村储蓄，吸收存款。
    目前各个战线上正在反右倾、鼓干劲，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，全国人民斗志昂扬，意气风发。各地必须抓住这个极为有利的时机，坚持政治挂帅和群众路线，向五亿多农民广泛进行社会主义总路线的宣传教育，进一步加强城乡互助，巩固工农联盟。在充分作好政治动员和思想工作的基础上，掀起一个千军万马的农产品收购运动，全面完成和超额完成国家1959年度的农产品收购任务。
