A Riveting Nine Minutes
    A Record of Zhang Maoqing's Skillful Victory Over Qimude in a Wrestling Match
    By Our Reporter Liu Bang

    The wrestling arena is currently witnessing a "Dragon and Tiger" battle. Sportsman Qimude from Inner Mongolia and Sportsman Zhang Maoqing from Shanxi Province are about to decide the winner in this nine-minute intense fight. What a riveting nine minutes!

    The burly Qimude, a herdsman from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, has long been seasoned in the Nadaam festivals. He was the 1957 national lightweight wrestling champion. This year, due to weight loss, he participated in the featherweight competition. In the preliminaries, he overcame all obstacles and was invincible, without falling down even once himself, earning him the nickname "Iron Youth." Compared to Qimude, Zhang Maoqing appears somewhat smaller. However, one cannot judge a book by its cover. He was born in Xinding County, Shanxi, the home of wrestling, and has developed a nimble and agile physique since childhood. He is resourceful, brave, and clear-headed, and was last year's national featherweight wrestling champion. In this preliminary competition, he also blazed a trail, maintaining his undefeated honor. Such evenly matched wrestlers, with equally sharp skills, created a very tense atmosphere when they stepped onto the field.

    As the stances were set, Zhang Maoqing took the initiative, grabbing for the attack and bending down to hug the legs. In previous matches, Qimude, relying on the strength of his legs rooted firmly to the ground, would sell a flaw when encountering an opponent trying to hug his legs, enticing them to hug, and then taking the opportunity to knock the opponent down with the force of Mount Tai crushing the summit. However, today he dared not do so. He knew that leg-hugging was a special skill of the Shanxi team, especially Zhang Maoqing's, which was unique and not to be trifled with easily. So Qimude hurriedly retracted his legs, shaking his upper body violently, attempting to break free from Zhang's attack. Who knew that in that instant, Zhang Maoqing would launch a surprise attack, displaying his other ingenious move – the releasing-hand hook. Zhang was seen smoothly moving his hands with the momentum, and his foot suddenly hooked, so fast that Qimude had already lost his center of gravity and fell to the ground with a thud. In the first round, the alert and flexible Zhang Maoqing gave the brave and tenacious opponent a clean and neat initial setback, temporarily leading with a score of five to zero.

    In the second and third rounds, Qimude "killed" with enthusiasm, launching frequent attacks with abundant energy and amazing sharpness, trying to reverse the defeat. At the same time, he proceeded step by step, steadily and surely, always strictly preventing Zhang Maoqing's leg-hugging. Strangely, Zhang Maoqing, known for his expertise in leg-hugging, rarely used this famous skill in tonight's match. On the contrary, all his leg-hugging movements were actually feints, and what really subdued Qimude were the "checking-leg," "sleeve-leg," and "back-pocket" techniques, which he usually didn't use often. It was a case of catching the opponent off guard and attacking where they were unprepared. Whenever Qimude attacked fiercely, at the critical moment when Zhang Maoqing was about to be thrown down, he swayed his body, borrowing the opponent's strength, smoothly stealing a goat, and immediately turning the danger into safety, catching the opponent off guard and staggering to the ground. Qimude was unwilling to fail and fought back bitterly, finally knocking Zhang Maoqing down once with a "leg entanglement" in the last thirty seconds. These skillfull techniques involving wits and courage repeatedly won applause from the audience. Thus, in the three rounds of fierce fighting, Zhang Maoqing defeated "strength" with "softness," winning the final victory with an overwhelming advantage of ten to one.

    As the audience dispersed, they discussed one after another, praising Zhang Maoqing for his "skillful" strength, saying "This is the victory of wisdom." In fact, this is also the victory of political and ideological work.

    According to Comrade Su Yongqing, the leader of the Shanxi wrestling team, Zhang Maoqing initially had many concerns about competing with Qimude, mainly because he was afraid of the opponent's good physique and great strength. The team leaders and comrades repeatedly helped Zhang Maoqing to liberate his thinking, build confidence, and carefully analyze and study the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, finally deciding on this battle plan of taking the lead with wit if strength was not enough. If this wrestling match was about wits, then this kind of wits was far from starting only after entering the arena. Comrade Zhang Maoqing also made the following summary of this wrestling match: "Know yourself and your enemy, go all out, use diverse methods, show your level, don't be afraid of failure, and strive for victory."

    扣人心弦的九分钟
    记张毛清智取其木德的一场摔跤比赛
    本报记者　柳梆
    摔跤坛上现在正是一场“龙虎斗”。运动健将、内蒙古的其木德和运动健将、山西省的张毛清，就要在这九分钟的激战中决定胜负了。这是多么扣人心弦的九分钟啊！
    虎背熊腰的其木德，是内蒙古草原的牧民，在那达慕大会上久历沙场，是1957年全国轻量级摔跤的冠军，今年因为体重减轻，参加次轻级比赛。在预赛中，他过关斩将，所向披靡，而且自己一个跤也没有跌倒过，人称“钢铁青年”。张毛清和其木德比较起来，显得是瘦小一些。但是人不可以貌相。他出生在摔跤之乡的山西忻定县，自幼练就一副灵巧敏捷的身手，机智勇敢，头脑清醒，是去年的全国次轻级摔跤冠军。在这次预赛中，也是一路披荆斩棘，一直保持不败的荣誉。这样针锋相对、势均力敌的摔跤手，一上场气氛就十分紧张。
    阵势摆开，张毛清先发制人，抢把进攻，弯腰就要抱腿。在以往的几场比赛中，其木德仗着自己双腿有落地生根的力气，碰上要抱腿的对手，他索性卖个破绽，伸腿引诱对手来抱，然后以泰山盖顶之势，趁机把对方压倒。然而今天他却不敢这样做。他知道抱腿是山西队的绝技，特别是张毛清的这一手，功夫独到，轻易惹他不得。于是其木德急忙抽腿，猛晃上身，企图挣脱张的进攻。那知刹那之间，张毛清奇兵突出，施展他的另一妙着——撒手勾。只见小张双手顺水推舟，脚下猛一挑勾，说时迟，那时快，其木德身体早已失去重心，扑哧一声，栽倒在地。第一局，机警灵活的张毛清，就这样清脆、干净、利索，给勇猛顽强的对手先来一个下马威，以五比零暂时领先。
    第二、三局，其木德“杀”得性起，以充沛的精力和惊人的锐气，频频进攻，力图扭转败局。同时又步步为营，稳扎稳打，始终严防张毛清的抱腿。奇怪的是以擅长抱腿见称的张毛清，今晚绝少施用他的这一驰誉跤坛的绝技，相反，他所有的抱腿动作，实际上都是佯攻，而真正制服其木德的是平日不常使用的“检腿”、“套腿”和“背口袋”，正所谓出其不意，攻其无备。每当其木德凶猛进攻，眼看就要把张毛清摔下去的千钧一发之间，他身子一晃，借对方之力，顺手牵羊，立刻使自己转危为安，使对方猝不及防，踉跄倒地。其木德那里甘心失败，苦苦反攻，在最后的三十秒钟中，终于用“缠腿”把张毛清摔倒一次。双方这些斗智斗勇，引人入胜的技艺，一再博得全场掌声。就这样，在三个回合的剧斗中，张毛清以“柔”克“刚”，以十比一的压倒优势赢得了决赛的胜利。
    散场的时候，观众议论纷纷，称赞张毛清有一手“巧”劲，说“这是智慧的胜利”。其实，这也是政治思想工作的胜利。
    听山西摔跤队的领队苏永清同志说：张毛清对于同其木德交手，开始是顾虑重重，主要是怕对方体魄好，力量大。队的领导同志和同志们一再帮助张毛清解放思想，树立信心，细心分析和研究双方的优缺点，最后才定下这套不能力胜则以智取的作战方案。如果说这场跤是斗智，那末这种斗智远不是上场以后才开始的。张毛清同志也给这场跤作了如下的小结：“知己知彼，放手去干，方法多样，打出水平，不怕失败，争取胜利”。
