Industry, Agriculture, and Commerce Work Together to Improve the Market
Shaanxi Properly Arranges Economic Work with Comprehensive Leaps Forward in Production, Procurement, Transportation, and Sales

(Our dispatch) The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee organized economic departments such as industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation to cooperate closely to promote production development and improve market supply, achieving remarkable results. Currently, the market supply situation has further improved, with a significant increase in the quantity and variety of daily-use industrial products. Some small commodities and traditional handicraft treasures are continuously entering the market. Many commercial outlets and service points have been added in both urban and rural areas. Mobile service artisans have begun to be active in the streets and alleys, and the primary market is also becoming more active.

In order to better solve market supply problems, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee convened a market issue conference in June, attended by secretaries of provincial, municipal, prefectural, and county committees, as well as heads of industrial, agricultural, commercial, transportation, and other departments above the county level. After the meeting, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, a comprehensive arrangement of economic work was carried out from the province to the production teams of various communes. The characteristic of this arrangement is to ensure that the production, procurement, transportation, and supply plans of various economic departments are integrated and connected with each other, and to facilitate frequent exchange of information and strengthen mutual cooperation in the implementation of these plans. After the market conference, the Xi'an Municipal Commercial Department transferred a group of cadres to factories to understand the production situation and immediately assisted in solving any problems found. For example, the quality of industrial soap produced by some small soap factories in Xi'an was very low. The commercial department found advanced ingredient methods from other cities, and after these small factories used these methods, the quality quickly improved. The Xi'an Municipal Commercial Department also collected hundreds of samples of daily-use goods from cities such as Shanghai for traveling exhibitions in various factories, serving as a reference for factories to increase the variety of colors and designs. Through the joint efforts of industrial and commercial departments, the quantity and quality of daily-use commodities in Xi'an have improved rapidly. In August, 288 new products were added compared to June, and the output of handicraft products reached more than 9 million pieces. Commercial departments in various regions have also made relatively good achievements in close cooperation with agricultural departments to help communes develop sideline production. For example, the Chenggu County Central Store extracted 40 employees to form five groups, which went deep into the grassroots to organize local sources of goods and helped production teams in various communes establish 33 sideline production bases with more than 40 production projects such as pig farming, fish farming, rope making, weaving of large cages, and dustpans. The store signed 48 purchase contracts with production teams and groups, totaling 63,000 yuan. They paid special attention to regulating the supply of young livestock and poultry when purchasing livestock and poultry. For example, the store purchased more than 1,100 live pigs and regulated the supply of more than 1,300 piglets, which strongly promoted the development of production. In order to transport agricultural and sideline products to various places in a timely manner and transport industrial products to the countryside to meet the people's needs, the agricultural, commercial, and transportation departments closely cooperated to tap transportation potential and greatly improve transportation efficiency. Since July and August, various counties have universally repaired roads during the agricultural production gaps, and established road maintenance sections to strengthen the maintenance of roads, so as to improve the transportation efficiency of automobiles. While developing diversified operations, communes generally transferred some labor and livestock power to form professional transportation teams to undertake short-distance transportation tasks. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300 professional transportation teams have been established throughout the province.

Due to the close cooperation of various economic departments in solving the difficulties in developing production, the commercial departments promptly purchased agricultural and sideline products, and improved the supply of livelihood and production materials, greatly stimulating the production enthusiasm of workers and farmers. Since July and August, the production and purchase volume of native and special products throughout the province have increased very rapidly. For example, the purchase of raw lacquer was 23 dan in July, and increased to 239 dan in August; the purchase of palm fiber was 420 dan in July, and increased to 837 dan in August, an increase of 99.2%; the purchase of honey was 242 dan in July, and increased to 557 dan in August. In the development of poultry and livestock, the growth was also very rapid due to the implementation of the policy of combining public and private raising. For example, there were 2.27 million poultry in Xi'an and Shangluo prefectures at the end of June, and it developed to 3.91 million at the end of July, an increase of 72.25%. The number of live pigs in Xi'an also increased by 21,242 heads. (Li Qian) (Attached Picture)

    工农商交同心协力搞好市场
    陕西妥善安排了经济工作产购运销全面跃进
    本报讯　陕西省各级党委组织工业、农业、商业、交通运输业等经济部门密切协作，促进生产发展，改进市场供应，已取得显著成绩。目前，市场供应情况已经进一步好转，日用工业品的数量、品种都有很大增加；一些小商品和传统手工业名贵产品源源上市；城市和农村都增设了不少商业门市部和服务点；流动服务的手艺人开始活跃在街头巷尾；初级市场也日渐活跃起来。
    中共陕西省委为了更好地解决市场供应问题，在6月份召开了有省、市、地、县委书记和县级以上工业、农业、商业、交通运输等部门负责人参加的市场问题会议。会后，从省到各公社的生产队，在党委统一领导下，对经济工作进行了一次全面的安排，这一安排的特点是保证各经济部门的生产、收购、运输和供应计划互相结合互相衔接。并在执行这些计划中，便于经常交流情况，加强相互之间的协作。西安市商业部门在市场会议以后，抽调了一批干部到工厂了解生产情况，发现有问题立即协助解决。如西安市有些小型肥皂厂生产的工业用皂质量很低，商业部门就在外埠找来了先进的配料方法，这些小厂使用了这个配料方法以后，质量很快提高了。西安市商业部门还从上海等城市搜集了几百种日用百货样品，到各厂巡回展览，作为各工厂增加花色品种的参考。通过工业和商业部门的共同努力，西安市的日用商品数量和质量提高都很快，8月份比六月份增加了二百八十八种新产品，手工业产品量达九百多万件。各地商业部门与农业部门紧密协作，帮助公社发展副业生产，也作出了比较好的成绩。如城固县中心商店抽出四十名职工，成立了五个组，深入基层组织地方货源，帮助各公社的生产队建立了三十三个副业生产基地，生产项目有养猪、养鱼、打草绳，编大笼、簸箕等四十多种，商店分别与生产队、组订立了四十八份收购合同，总值达六万三千元。他们在收购家畜家禽时特别注意调剂供应幼畜幼禽。如该店收购了一千一百多头生猪，又调剂供应了一千三百多头小猪，有力地促进了生产发展。为了把农副产品及时地运往各地，把工业产品运往农村，满足人民生活需要，农业、商业和运输部门紧密配合，挖掘运输潜力，大大提高了运输效率。7、8月份以来，各县利用农业生产空隙，普遍对公路进行了普修，并成立了养路段，加强对公路的养护工作，以提高汽车的运输效率。在开展多种经营的同时，各公社普遍抽调部分劳力畜力，成立专业运输队，担负短途运输任务，据不完全统计，全省已经成立了专业运输队三百多个。
    由于各经济部门密切协作，解决发展生产中的困难，商业部门及时收购农副产品，并改善生活和生产资料的供应工作，大大激发了工、农群众的生产积极性。7、8月份以来，全省土特产品生产和收购数量增长都非常快。如生漆，7月份收购二十三担，8月份增加到二百三十九担；棕片7月份收购四百二十担，8月份增加到八百三十七担，增加了99.2％；蜂蜜7月份收购二百四十二担，8月份增加到五百五十七担。在发展家禽家畜中，由于贯彻公养和私养并举的方针，增长也非常快。如西安市和商雒专区6月底共有家禽二百二十七万只，到7月底就发展到三百九十一万只，增长了72.25％。西安市的生猪也增加了二万一千二百四十二头。　　　　　　　　　（李茜）（附图片）
