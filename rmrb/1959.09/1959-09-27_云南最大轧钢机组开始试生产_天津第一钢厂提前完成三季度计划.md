Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 24th. Yunnan Province's largest rolling mill unit to date has been installed in the newly built rolling mill workshop of the Kunming No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant and has begun trial production. The steel billets and steel materials rolled during the trial production have all been tested and found to be qualified. This rolling mill unit can produce about 100,000 tons of various specifications of round steel, angle steel, light rails and other steel products each year.
    Since Yunnan Province began vigorously developing iron and steel last year, its steelmaking capacity has far exceeded its rolling capacity. The steelmaking capacity has increased more than six times compared with the year before, while the rolling capacity has increased less than doubled. After this rolling mill unit is put into production, it will play a significant role in meeting the needs of the rapidly growing steelmaking capacity and meeting the requirements of industrial construction throughout the province.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th. The workers of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant completed the third quarter's production plan for steel and steel products seven and ten days ahead of schedule, respectively. It is estimated that by the 27th, steel production will exceed the plan by 1,000 tons, and steel production will exceed the plan by 10,000 tons, realizing the conditions for challenging Anshan Iron and Steel with "a great battle in August and September, exceeding production by 1,000 tons of steel and 10,000 tons of steel products" three days ahead of schedule.
    Since August and September, encouraged by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers of this plant have deeply carried out the competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, and vigorously carried out technical innovation. In the past two months, the workers of the entire plant have created more than 200 new records and more than 2,000 technical innovations, thereby making production rise steadily.

    云南最大轧钢机组开始试生产
    天津第一钢厂提前完成三季度计划
    新华社昆明24日电　云南省目前最大的一套轧钢机组在昆明第二钢铁厂新建的轧钢车间安装完毕，开始试生产，试生产中轧出的钢坯和钢材，经过检验，全部合格。这套轧钢机组每年可以生产十万吨左右各种规格的元钢、角钢、轻便轨道等钢材。
    云南省自去年大办钢铁以来，炼钢能力已远远超过轧钢能力，炼钢能力比前年增长了六倍多，而轧钢能力增长还不到一倍。这套轧钢机组投入生产以后，对于适应炼钢能力迅速增长的需要，满足全省工业建设的要求，有很大的作用。
    新华社天津26日电　天津第一钢厂职工提前七天和十天完成了第三季度的钢、钢材产量计划。预计到27日，钢产量可以超过计划一千吨，钢材产量可以超过计划一万吨，提前三天实现“大战八九月，超产千吨钢、万吨材”的向鞍钢应战的条件。
    8、9月份以来，这个厂的职工在党的八届八中全会决议的鼓舞下，深入开展了比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛，大搞技术革新。近两个月间，全厂职工创造了新纪录二百多项，技术革新两千多件，从而使生产节节上升。
