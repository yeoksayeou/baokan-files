Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, China's education has made tremendous achievements in the past decade. China's education has seen significant development and improvement in both quantity and quality compared to old China. Especially since September 19, 1958, when the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, in their instructions on education work, more clearly and systematically put forward the education policy of "education serving proletarian politics, and education combined with productive labor," a profound education revolution has unfolded, and education has achieved even more brilliant achievements.

China has had a history of school education for eighty-seven years, from the establishment of the "Tongwen Guan" by the Qing government in Beijing in 1862 to the liberation of the mainland in 1949. However, the development of school education in New China has multiplied the highest development figures in the eighty-seven years of old China in just ten years. In 1958, the number of children in kindergartens and students in various types of schools at all levels in China were: 30 million children in kindergartens, exceeding the 130,000 kindergarten children in 1946, the year with the most in old China, by 230 times; 86 million primary school students, exceeding the 23.68 million primary school students in 1946, the year with the most in old China, by 2.6 times; 8.52 million ordinary middle school students, exceeding the 1.496 million middle school students in 1946, the year with the most in old China, by 4.7 times, an increase of 7.2 times compared to 1949; 1.47 million secondary specialized school students, exceeding the student population of 1946, the most developed year for vocational education in old China, by 2.8 times; 660,000 higher education students, exceeding the 155,000 higher education students in 1947, the year with the most in old China, by 3.3 times, an increase of 4.7 times compared to 1949. Most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have established a higher education system including science and engineering, agriculture, medicine, teachers' colleges, and comprehensive universities. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which previously did not have a single higher education institution, also began to establish agricultural colleges, medical colleges, and teachers' colleges last year. In the past decade, the education of various ethnic minorities in China has also achieved tremendous development under the care and attention of the Party. In 1958, there were 4.24 million primary school students among ethnic minorities across the country, an increase of 3.5 times compared to 1951; more than 390,000 middle school students, an increase of 8.8 times compared to 1951; and 22,000 higher education students, an increase of 9.6 times compared to 1951. What was the development of education in Western capitalist countries during the same period? In the United States, the number of higher education students increased by only 29% and middle school students by only 59% in the ten years from 1948 to 1958. In the United Kingdom, the number of higher education students increased by only 75% in the thirty-five years from 1921 to 1956. Even with such slow growth in student numbers, these countries still have a large number of higher education graduates wandering the streets every year because they cannot find jobs.

The Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics, and education combined with productive labor," was further implemented in 1958, resulting in unprecedented development in education that year. In 1958, primary education was basically universalized in many cities and counties across the country, with more than 85% of school-age children enrolled in school. The number of primary school students increased by 34% compared to 1957; middle school students increased by 41%; and higher education students increased by 50%. At the same time, literacy campaigns were carried out among 60 million people, and industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes ran various types of spare-time schools, with the broad masses of people actively participating in learning. Over the past year, all localities have strengthened the Party's leadership over education work, strengthened Marxist-Leninist political education and ideological education, and greatly improved the political consciousness of students. In addition to establishing close ties with factories and communes, schools at all levels have also established their own factories and farms, closely integrating teaching and research with productive labor, and achieving great results.

The socialist system has opened up broad development paths for China's education. After the broad masses of workers and peasants achieved political and economic emancipation, they urgently demanded to learn culture and send their children to school. The development of China's socialist construction requires a large number of cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. To meet the requirements of national socialist construction, the Party and the government continued to adopt the policy of "walking on two legs" in education work, which had been consistently implemented in revolutionary base areas and old liberated areas, and developed people's education rapidly, well, and economically. In the past decade, the state's expenditure on education has increased by an average of 23.6% annually. In 1959, the state's expenditure on education was 6.74 times that of 1950, with higher education expenditure exceeding sixteen times the annual higher education expenditure during the Kuomintang rule. From 1950 to 1958, the state newly built more than 35 million square meters of school buildings, including more than 11 million square meters of school buildings for higher education, which is more than three times the total area of higher education school buildings built in the fifty years of old China (3.4 million square meters). Higher education institutions across the country have also newly established thousands of laboratories equipped with modern scientific instruments and equipment, and engineering colleges have established thousands of practice factories and workshops, owning tens of thousands of new-style lathes and machines. Even the level of practice factories and experimental equipment in today's secondary specialized schools far exceeds the experimental equipment of higher education institutions in old China, and old vocational schools cannot compare. In the past decade, in addition to government-run schools, the Party has also attached great importance to mobilizing the masses and helping them run schools themselves. Mass-run schools are mainly collective schools run by workers in factories and mines and by the masses of agricultural cooperatives and people's communes. It can not only help the state solve the shortage of education funds, school buildings, equipment, and teachers, but also organically combine education and productive labor. According to incomplete statistics, among the 28,900 ordinary middle schools across the country, there are more than 14,000 people-run middle schools; among the 776,800 primary schools across the country, there are more than 312,800 people-run primary schools. In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of building socialism and encouraged by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a high tide of mass school-running was universally set off in various places. In just a few months, many counties and cities universalized primary education through people-run primary schools. At the same time, half-day agricultural middle schools and other vocational middle schools sprang up in various places, with the number of students reaching 2 million, greatly promoting the development of secondary education and basically meeting the strong demands of rural primary school graduates for further education and the broad masses of rural youth for learning cultural and scientific knowledge.

In the ten years since the founding of the country, spare-time education for workers and peasants has flourished as never before. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas across the country have universally established spare-time learning organizations such as literacy classes, people's schools, red and expert schools, and spare-time cultural and technical schools, combining them with the characteristics of production. Every year, tens of millions of workers and peasants have shaken off illiteracy and are advancing towards higher-level cultural fortresses. Last year, after the Party put forward the historical task of technological revolution and cultural revolution to the people of the whole country, the enthusiasm of workers and peasants for learning cultural and scientific knowledge was unprecedentedly high. A new high tide of literacy campaigns, unprecedented in scale and momentum, appeared throughout the country, with one year's literacy work exceeding the literacy achievements of the past eight years. By the end of last year, more than 30 million workers and peasants across the country were participating in learning in various types and levels of spare-time schools. Now, from the perspective of the whole country, the proportion of illiterate workers in industrial and mining enterprises has generally decreased to about 30%.

The ten-year education of New China has not only achieved great development in quantity, but more importantly, the nature of education has undergone fundamental changes. From the very beginning, school education in New China has implemented the Party's class line, and the composition of students has undergone major changes. In 1958, students of worker-peasant origin accounted for 75% of ordinary middle schools, 77% of secondary specialized schools, and about 48% of higher education institutions. This ensures the political quality of students. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, school education has also achieved great success in cultivating talents for national socialist construction, cultivating cultured laborers with socialist consciousness, and cultivating communist ideological qualities in young people. From 1949 to 1958, more than 1.7 million graduates from higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools have become an important force in various construction undertakings across the country. Many outstanding graduates independently shoulder important work. For example, in the first modern Anshan Iron and Steel Giant Seamless Steel Tube Plant in the country, the nine assistant engineers who maintain the normal operation of this world-class machine in terms of electricity, machinery, and production technology are all graduates of higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools in New China. Under the care of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, they are now able to work independently. In the past decade, more than 10 million graduates of senior primary schools and junior middle schools have participated in industrial and agricultural production labor. They are a powerful new force with socialist consciousness and cultural knowledge on the industrial and agricultural production front, and many of them have become excellent labor models.

In the ten years since the founding of the country, the education of New China has always been advancing under the leadership of the Party. Especially in the education revolution of 1958, the Party further established its leadership over education. The Party plays a leading role in schools not only in politics, but also in teaching and scientific research. Last year, all types of schools resolutely implemented the Party's education policy, universally carried out work-study programs, and the broad masses of teachers and students actively participated in industrial and agricultural production labor and the great steel-making movement, developing a good atmosphere of loving labor and respecting working people. Due to the emancipation of the mind and the promotion of productive labor, the scientific research work of many schools and teachers has been greatly developed. All schools have established a socialist education system that combines teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, forming an atmosphere among students of both loving labor and studying diligently. Through productive labor, teachers and students have connected with production practice, mastered industrial and agricultural production knowledge and skills, and teaching quality has been significantly improved. For example, since last year, higher education graduates have generally combined their graduation designs with current national construction projects and scientific research tasks, and the quality is generally better than in previous years. Many graduation designs have solved problems that urgently need to be solved or must be solved in the long term in current production and scientific research, and have been adopted by the state for construction. For example, the Miyun Reservoir, which was recently completed, was constructed according to the graduation design of the graduates of the Department of Water Conservancy of Tsinghua University last year. On the eve of the enthusiastic celebration of the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the country by the people of the whole country, the broad masses of teachers and students across the country have expressed their determination to make even greater efforts to consolidate and develop the achievements of the education revolution in the great leap forward last year, and under the leadership of the Party, push the education of New China to new heights.

    社会主义教育培养了社会主义建设的强大生力军
    十年教育大革命大丰收
    1958年小学中学大学学生超过旧中国最多一年的二点六倍到四点七倍
    工农学生成份大增。一千多万毕业生已成为各项建设事业的重要力量
    据新华社18日讯　我国教育事业在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，十年来取得了巨大的成绩，我国教育事业无论在数量和质量方面，都比旧中国有显著的发展和提高。特别是从1958年9月19日中共中央和国务院在关于教育工作的指示中，更加明确和系统地提出“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针以后，展开了一个深刻的教育大革命，教育事业取得了更加辉煌的成就。
    我国自1862年清朝政府在北京创办“同文馆”，到1949年全国大陆解放，已有八十七年学校教育的历史。可是新中国学校教育的发展，在短短十年中却成倍地超过了旧中国八十七年中最高发展数字。1958年我国幼儿园儿童和各级各类学校学生人数是：幼儿园儿童三千万，超过旧中国幼儿园人数最多的1946年十三万人的二百三十倍；小学生八千六百万人，超过旧中国小学在校人数最多的1946年二千三百六十八万人的二点六倍；普通中学学生八百五十二万人，超过旧中国中学在校人数最多的1946年一百四十九万六千人的四点七倍，比1949年增长了七点二倍；中等专业学校学生一百四十七万人，超过旧中国职业教育最发达的1946年学生人数的二点八倍；高等学校学生六十六万人，超过旧中国高等学校学生人数最多的1947年十五万五千人的三点三倍，比1949年增长了四点七倍。全国大部分省、市、自治区都已经建立起一套包括理工、农、医、师范和综合大学的高等教育体系，过去没有一所高等学校的宁夏回族自治区，去年也开始建立了农学院、医学院和师范学院。十年中，我国各少数民族的教育事业，也在党的关怀与重视下，获得了巨大的发展。1958年全国少数民族中，已有小学生四百二十四万人，比1951年增加了三点五倍，中学生三十九万余人，比1951年增加了八点八倍；高等学校学生二万二千人，比1951年增加了九点六倍。在这同一期间，西方资本主义国家教育的发展情况是怎样呢？美国从1948到1958年十年间，高等学校的学生只增加了29％，中学生只增加了59％。英国高等学校学生，从1921到1956年三十五年间，也只增加了75％。这些国家即使学生增长速度如此缓慢，每年仍然有大批高等学校毕业生因找不到职业而踯躅街头。
    党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，在1958年进一步贯彻执行的结果，使得这一年的教育事业得到空前的发展。1958年，全国许多市、县基本上普及了小学教育，全国学龄儿童入学的达到85％以上，小学生比1957年增加了34％；中学生增加了41％；高等学校学生增加了50％。同时还在六千万人口中进行了扫除文盲的工作，工矿企业和人民公社办了各级各类业余学校，广大人民群众踊跃参加学习。各地一年来都加强了党对教育工作的领导，加强了马克思列宁主义的政治教育和思想教育，大大提高了学生的政治觉悟。各级学校除了和工厂、公社建立密切联系以外，还自办工厂、农场，使教学和研究工作密切与生产劳动结合起来，收到了伟大的成果。
    社会主义制度为我国教育事业开辟了广阔的发展道路。广大工农群众在政治上、经济上翻身之后，迫切要求学习文化和送子女入学；我国社会主义建设事业的发展，需要大量的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。党和政府适应国家社会主义建设的要求，继续采用革命根据地和老解放区一贯执行的教育工作两条腿走路的方针，多快好省地发展了人民教育事业。十年中，国家在教育经费方面的支出，平均每年增加23.6％。1959年国家教育经费的支出，等于1950年的六点七四倍，其中高等教育经费支出，超过了国民党统治时期每年高等教育经费的十六倍以上。1950到1958年，国家新修建的校舍有三千五百多万平方米，其中高等学校新修建的校舍一千一百多万平方米，等于旧中国五十年修建的高等学校校舍总面积（三百四十万平方米）的三倍多。全国高等学校还新建立了上千个拥有现代科学仪器设备的试验室，工科院校建立了上千个实习工厂和车间，拥有上万台新式车床和机器。即以今天中等专业学校的实习工厂和实验设备的水平来说，也远远超过旧中国高等学校的实验设备，旧的职业学校更无法相比了。十年来，除了政府办学外，党还十分重视发动群众、帮助群众自己办学。群众办学主要是厂矿企业的职工和农业合作社、人民公社的群众集体办学。它既能帮助国家解决教育经费、校舍、设备和师资等方面的不足，又能够使教育和生产劳动有机地结合。据不完全统计，在全国二万八千九百所普通中学中，民办中学就有一万四千多所；全国七十七万六千八百所小学中，民办小学就有三十一万二千八百多所。1958年，在党的建设社会主义的总路线光辉的照耀下，和在工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞下，各地更是普遍地掀起了群众办学的高潮。在短短几个月中，许多县、市通过民办小学普及了小学教育。同时，各地风起云涌地大办半日制的农业中学和其它职业中学，在校学生数达到二百万人，大大促进了中等教育事业的发展，基本上满足了农村高小毕业生升学和广大农村青年学习文化科学知识的强烈要求。
    建国十年来，工农群众的业余教育更是空前地蓬勃发展。在各级党委领导下，全国工矿企业和农村，结合生产的特点，普遍建立了识字班、民校、红专学校、业余文化技术学校等业余学习组织。每年都有成千万的工农群众摆脱文盲状态，向高一级的文化堡垒进军。去年，党向全国人民提出技术革命、文化革命的历史任务后，工农群众学习文化科学知识的热情空前高涨，全国范围内出现了前所未有的声势浩大的“全民学、万人教”的扫盲新高潮，一年的扫盲工作超过了过去八年的扫盲成绩。到去年年底，全国参加各类各级业余学校学习的工农群众，达三千万人之多。现在，从全国来说，工矿企业的职工中文盲比例一般已下降到30％左右。
    新中国的十年教育事业，不但数量上得到巨大发展，更重要的是教育的性质起了根本的变化。新中国的学校教育一开始就贯彻了党的阶级路线，学生成份起了重大的改变。1958年，工农成份的学生，在普通中学中已占75％，中等专业学校中占77％，高等学校的工农成份的学生，也已占48％左右。这就保证了学生的政治质量。同时，学校教育在党的领导下，在培养国家社会主义建设人才、培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者、培养青少年共产主义思想品质方面，也都获得了很大的成绩。1949到1958年中，高等学校和中等专业学校培养的一百七十多万毕业生，已经成为全国各项建设事业中的重要力量。许多优秀的毕业生独立担负了重要的工作。如全国第一个现代化鞍钢巨型无缝钢管厂中，从电气、机械、生产技术等方面维护这个世界第一流的机器正常运转的九个助理工程师，就都是新中国高等学校和中等专业学校的毕业生。他们在党的关怀下和苏联专家的帮助下，已能独立工作。十年中，有一千多万高小和初中毕业生参加了工农业生产劳动，他们是工农业生产战线上一支有社会主义觉悟、有文化知识的强大的生力军，其中许多人已经成为优秀的劳动能手。
    建国十年来，新中国教育事业始终是在党的领导下向前迈进。特别是在1958年的教育大革命中，党对教育事业更进一步确定了领导权。党在学校不仅在政治上起领导作用，而且在教学、科学研究工作上也起领导作用。去年，各类学校坚决贯彻了党的教育方针，普遍开展了勤工俭学，广大师生积极参加工农业生产劳动和大炼钢铁运动，养成了热爱劳动和尊敬劳动人民的风气。许多学校师生由于解放思想和生产劳动的推动，科学研究工作有很大开展。各学校建立了教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合的社会主义教育制度，在学生中形成了既热爱劳动，又认真读书的风气。师生通过生产劳动，联系生产实际，掌握了工农业生产知识技能，教学质量有了显著提高。如去年以来，高等学校毕业生普遍结合当前国家建设项目和科学研究任务来进行毕业设计，质量一般都胜过往年。许多毕业设计解决了当前生产和科学研究中亟待解决或长远必须解决的问题，并已为国家采用施工，如最近竣工的密云水库，就是按照去年清华大学水利系毕业生的毕业设计进行施工的。在全国人民热烈迎接伟大的建国十周年前夕，全国广大师生都纷纷表示决心，要鼓足更大的干劲，巩固和发展去年大跃进中教育大革命的成果，在党的领导下，把新中国的教育事业推向更新的高峰。
