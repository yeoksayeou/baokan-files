The Socialist Transformation of China's National Economy
Xue Muqiao

The socialist transformation of China's national economy began in 1949 and was basically completed in 1956, taking seven or eight years.

Old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. To transform such a society into a socialist society, it was necessary to go through two revolutions: the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the victorious completion of the democratic revolution and the beginning of the socialist revolution. The two revolutions cannot be completely separated. In fact, some of the tasks of the democratic revolution (such as land reform in the later liberated areas) continued to be completed within two or three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China. And some of the tasks of the socialist revolution (such as the establishment of a state power led by the working class and a socialist state-owned economy) had already begun in the liberated areas before the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The dominant forces in old China's national economy were imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the cities, the dominant force was the comprador and feudal state monopoly capitalism economy headed by the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. In the countryside, the dominant force was the feudal landlord class economy. Imperialism maintained its control over China's economy through the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the landlord class. The victory of the people's democratic revolution confiscated the land of the bureaucratic capital and the landlord class, thereby eliminating the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the landlord class, the two agents of imperialism in China. At the same time, it abolished all the privileges of imperialism in China, and imperialism's economic control over China was also eliminated. In this way, China changed from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country into a new democratic country, that is, a country in transition from capitalism to socialism.

The Establishment of the Leading Position of the Socialist State-Owned Economy

With the establishment of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, the Chinese people confiscated bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, turning them into property owned by the whole people. They carried out democratic reforms and production reforms in these enterprises, and implemented a socialist management system, thus creating a brand-new and powerful socialist state-owned economy.

At that time, coexisting with the socialist state-owned economy were a relatively large number of national capitalist economies and a larger number of individual economies of peasants and handicraftsmen. The socialist state-owned economy controlled the most important economic lifelines of the country (including most of the modern industry and transportation), but it was severely damaged in the war and did not have a dominant position in terms of quantity. At that time, national industry and commerce, especially the individual agriculture and individual handicraft industry that surrounded us like a vast ocean, were dominant in terms of quantity. Although most of China's national bourgeoisie participated in the people's democratic united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the people's democratic revolution, or adopted a neutral attitude towards the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, they held a strong desire to develop capitalism and were unwilling to see the victory of socialism on Chinese soil. The Chinese peasants had formed a close alliance with the working class in the long people's democratic revolution, and the poor among them, after education, would be willing to take the socialist road; but the more affluent among them (rich middle peasants) had, to varying degrees, the desire to develop capitalism.

During this period, the main contradiction in China was already the contradiction between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy, and the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. On the eve of and in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the bourgeoisie, in the face of the powerful military and political power of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, had to acknowledge the political leadership of the Party and the working class; however, the bourgeoisie believed that they still had an advantage in the economy, and they were determined not to give up this advantage. The economic struggle at that time was mainly reflected in market prices. The national bourgeoisie, especially the speculative capital among them, took advantage of the market chaos caused by the Kuomintang reactionary government's decade of inflation, and took advantage of the fact that the People's Liberation War had not yet completely ended and the country's financial and economic situation had not yet stabilized, to frantically engage in speculation and hoarding, driving up prices, and seeking exorbitant profits. As soon as the Central People's Government was established, it immediately launched a fierce struggle against speculative capital. The Party and the government saw that if the rampant attack of speculative capital was not thoroughly crushed, it would be impossible to stabilize prices. And if prices were not stable, it would be difficult to restore industrial and agricultural production and urban-rural trade, as well as to stabilize people's lives.

In the first quarter of 1950, the Central People's Government began to uniformly manage the country's financial and economic work, concentrated all the economic power in the hands of the state, tightened the currency, and stabilized prices. By March of the same year, prices were quickly stabilized, thereby ending the market chaos caused by inflation in old China for more than a decade. In the struggle to stabilize prices, speculative capital suffered a heavy blow.

After prices stabilized, the false purchasing power caused by inflation suddenly disappeared, and many hoarded materials were sold to the market, which caused serious difficulties for private industrial and commercial enterprises that had been accustomed to speculative hoarding for many years. In order to quickly restore the national economy, the Central People's Government immediately carried out the work of adjusting industry and commerce. Through measures such as purchasing and processing orders, it quickly rescued private industrial and commercial enterprises that still met the needs of the country and the people from shutdowns, enabling them to carry out normal production and management under the leadership of the state-owned economy. The work of adjusting industry and commerce not only helped capitalist industry and commerce overcome temporary difficulties, but also placed important private industries under the leadership of the state-owned economy through measures such as processing orders, and gradually incorporated their production into the track of national planning.

In the third quarter of 1950, the work of adjusting industry and commerce was successfully completed. In order to accelerate the restoration of industrial and agricultural production, the state began a large-scale urban-rural material exchange movement. Urban-rural material exchange expanded the sales of various agricultural and sideline products, thereby stimulating the development of agriculture and various sideline productions; on the other hand, it increased the purchasing power of farmers, opened up a vast market for urban industrial products, thereby stimulating the restoration and development of industrial production. At the same time, the state universally established supply and marketing cooperatives in the vast rural areas, and under the leadership and support of state-owned commerce, engaged in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and supplied farmers with various means of production and consumer goods they needed. In this way, state-owned commerce controlled a large number of industrial products through processing orders, and controlled a large number of agricultural products through supply and marketing cooperatives, thereby greatly consolidating its leading position in the national market.

In 1951, a new and prosperous situation appeared in urban industry and commerce. Industrial and commercial capitalists tried to break away from the control of the state-owned economy by taking advantage of this favorable opportunity. However, with most of the main industrial and agricultural products already in the hands of state-owned commerce, it was no longer possible for them to conduct open and legal struggles with the state-owned economy in the market. They used the old personnel who were massively received by state organs and state-owned enterprises at that time to bribe the cadres of our organs and enterprises and engage in various illegal activities such as tax evasion. In early 1952, in order to repel this rampant attack by the bourgeoisie, the Party and the government first carried out the struggle against "anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy" in state organs and state-owned enterprises, and then carried out the struggle against "anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of labor and materials, anti-theft of state property, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence" against private industrial and commercial enterprises. This vigorous "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" movement achieved great victory with the enthusiastic support of the working class. The national bourgeoisie recognized that socialism was an irresistible trend, and therefore they had to accept the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and a few progressive elements among them began to be willing to accept socialist transformation.

From 1949 to 1952, was the period of restoration of China's national economy. In a short period of more than three years, China not only successfully realized the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, but also firmly established the leading position of the socialist state-owned economy in the national economy. During this period, the proportion of socialist industry in the total industrial output value increased from 34.7% to 56%. By 1952, state processing orders for private industry also accounted for 56% of the total output value of private industry. In terms of commerce, from 1950 to 1952, the proportion of state-owned commerce in the wholesale volume increased from 23.2% to 60.5%, and the proportion of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives in the retail volume increased from 11.6% to 34.4%. In the countryside, not only have supply and marketing cooperatives been universally established, but also the mutual aid and cooperation movement in production has also made preliminary progress.

In 1953, on the basis of the great achievements already made in the restoration period, China began to enter a period of large-scale and planned socialist economic construction. In this year, the Party Central Committee, based on the political and economic situation at that time and the demands of the broad masses of the people, announced the general line of our country during the transition period, which was to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of our country and gradually complete socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry and capitalist industry and commerce. The announcement of the general line made the broad masses of working people jubilant, which not only accelerated our country's economic and cultural construction, but also accelerated the socialist transformation of our national economy.

The Cooperativization of Individual Agriculture and Handicraft Industry

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chinese farmers completed two major revolutions, land reform and agricultural cooperativization, in about ten years. As early as during the Liberation War, farmers in China's liberated areas carried out land reform under the leadership of the Party. After the nationwide liberation, land reform was rapidly promoted to the newly liberated areas, and by 1952, it had been successfully completed throughout the country except for some minority areas. Land reform greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for production, and enabled China's agricultural production, which had suffered more than ten years of war damage, to quickly recover and exceed the highest historical level.

Although land reform liberated agricultural productive forces to a great extent, agriculture after land reform was still based on individual economy. If cooperation was not further realized, it would still be difficult for productive forces to be fully liberated. As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "On Cooperatives" that after reforming feudal land relations, it was necessary to carry out a second revolution, namely, agricultural cooperativization. At that time, the Party and the revolutionary government used the original habit of farmers to exchange labor and mutual assistance to help farmers establish organizations such as labor exchange teams or mutual aid groups. With the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, this mutual aid and cooperation organization began to develop throughout the country. At the end of 1951, the CPC Central Committee made a "Resolution on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production," guiding farmers to widely organize temporary and permanent mutual aid groups, and to develop semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives with emphasis in areas with the conditions. By 1952, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid groups accounted for 40% of the total number of peasant households.

The mutual aid group is a collective labor organization built on the basis of individual economy. Farmers participating in the mutual aid group still take each household as a production unit, but they are organized in the form of labor exchange to work together and exchange the use of their own draft animals and farm tools. After the farmers were organized, because labor, draft animals and farm tools were used more rationally, the difficulties of the individual economy were overcome to a certain extent, and agricultural production was further developed. Under China's specific conditions, the mutual aid group is the primary form of agricultural cooperativization, and it already has the seeds of socialism. However, the mutual aid group is still based on individual economy, and there is a contradiction between individual management and collective labor. Therefore, the rational operation of land and the rational use of labor, draft animals, and farm tools are still limited by the individual management of each peasant household. Therefore, for the further development of agricultural productive forces, the cooperation of agriculture needs to be further improved, that is, from the mutual aid group to the semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative. (Primary Cooperative)

In the process of the development of mutual aid groups, semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives have already begun to be tried out. In December 1953, the CPC Central Committee made another "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," deciding to promote the continued progress of the mutual aid and cooperation movement with the development of agricultural production cooperatives as the center. At the time of the autumn harvest in 1953, there were already more than 15,000 semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives across the country, which developed to more than 114,000 at the time of the autumn harvest in 1954, and then developed to 650,000 in June 1955, with a total of 16.9 million peasant households joining the cooperative, accounting for about 14% of the total number of peasant households in the country.

In the semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative, the land is still privately owned by each household, but it is managed uniformly by the cooperative, and the draft animals and large farm tools privately owned by each household are also handed over to the cooperative for unified use. The products of the cooperative are jointly owned by the members participating in the cooperative. After deducting the expenses in production and paying agricultural tax, and extracting a certain amount of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, most of it is distributed according to the amount of labor provided by the members, and a small part is distributed according to the amount of land invested by the members. The draft animals and large farm tools handed over to the cooperative by the members must also obtain a certain reward. This kind of cooperative, from the collective management of land, the main part of the labor results is distributed according to work, there is public property (public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and the share fund of members joining the cooperative), etc., is of a socialist nature. However, the land and most of the draft animals and farm tools are still privately owned by each household, and in addition to labor dividends, there are also land dividends and other rewards for privately owned means of production, so it still retains factors of private ownership. In this semi-socialist cooperative, the accumulation of public property gradually increases, and some privately owned draft animals and large farm tools are gradually priced and turned into public property, thereby gradually increasing the socialist component.

The semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative has greater superiority than the mutual aid group. It has basically overcome the dispersion of the individual economy, thereby enabling agricultural productive forces to further develop. In the rapid development of semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, a small number of cooperatives with particularly good foundations have, with the consent of the members, canceled land dividends and completely priced draft animals and large farm tools and turned them into public property, thereby rising from semi-socialist cooperatives to socialist cooperatives (advanced cooperatives).

In July 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on the question of agricultural cooperativization, criticizing and correcting the right-leaning conservative ideas of some comrades in the Party at that time, and pointed out that the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization had already arrived in some areas, and was about to arrive nationwide. The two resolutions mentioned earlier, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's report, stipulated the correct policies and guidelines for China's cooperativization, and stipulated the correct class line, thereby ensuring that agricultural cooperativization developed rapidly and healthily. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, in the winter of 1955, the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization appeared throughout the country. At the end of 1955, the number of peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives reached more than 75 million, accounting for 63% of the total number of peasant households in the country. By the end of 1956, the number of peasant households joining the cooperative had accounted for 92.8% of the total number of peasant households, of which those participating in advanced cooperatives had accounted for 63.2% of the total number of peasant households. The national agricultural cooperativization movement was basically completed at this time.

The reason why China's agricultural cooperativization could be completed so quickly is first of all because our Party not only led the peasants to completely complete the land reform, but also resolutely implemented the mass line in the land reform. In the land reform, we relied on the poor peasants, united the middle peasants, and organized the power of the masses themselves to fight against the landlords and rich peasants, thereby thoroughly defeating the landlord class, weakening the rich peasants, and greatly raising the consciousness of the masses, which provided extremely favorable conditions for our Party to further lead the peasants to carry out agricultural cooperativization.

The reason why cooperativization could be completed so quickly is also because the Party stipulated the correct policies, guidelines, and class line in the cooperativization movement. The Party not only adopted various forms of mutual aid and cooperation from low-level to high-level to guide the peasants step by step onto the road of socialism, but also consistently adhered to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit in the process of cooperativization. Whether to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and which form of mutual aid and cooperation organization to participate in is entirely decided by the peasants voluntarily; after being organized, in dealing with the relationship between poor peasants and middle peasants, the principle of mutual benefit is correctly grasped so that everyone does not suffer losses. After the peasants joined the mutual aid and cooperation organization, or when the mutual aid group rose to a primary cooperative or the primary cooperative rose to an advanced cooperative, it was necessary to ensure that the income of more than 90% of their families could be increased by relying on the increase in agricultural production. The Party also adopted a correct class line in the process of cooperativization, first absorbing activists from poor peasants and lower-middle peasants into the cooperative, and then absorbing other peasants into the cooperative, and maintaining the leadership of the former two types of peasants in the cooperative. Only after the cooperative was completely consolidated, could the rich peasant elements and the original landlord elements be individually absorbed into the cooperative, thereby completely eliminating the landlord and rich peasant classes.

At the same time as agricultural cooperativization, China's handicraft industry also gradually completed cooperativization. China's handicraft industry also adopted a policy of gradual transition in cooperation. According to the characteristics of handicraft commodity production, the Party and the government first helped handicraft workers organize supply and marketing groups to collectively purchase raw materials and sell finished products from state-owned commercial or supply and marketing cooperatives. Handicraft workers participating in the group still produced independently. After the supply and marketing group accumulated a certain amount of public property, it could expand or merge into a handicraft supply and marketing cooperative, which was responsible for supplying raw materials, selling finished products, and beginning to carry out division of labor and cooperation in production. This supply and marketing cooperative would then further develop into a collectively produced handicraft production cooperative, thereby completing the transition from an individual economy to a socialist collective economy. The handicraft cooperative organization was still in the stage of key pilot projects during the restoration of the national economy. It began to develop in large quantities from 1953. By the end of 1955, the members of the handicraft cooperative (group) had developed to 2.2 million, accounting for 27% of the handicraft workers in the country. At the beginning of 1956, with the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, the socialist transformation upsurge also appeared among handicraft workers throughout the country. By the end of 1956, the members of the handicraft cooperative had accounted for more than 90% of the total number of handicraft workers, and China's handicraft cooperativization was basically completed.

In 1956, China's individual small businesses also basically realized cooperation, and carried out distribution and sales agency business for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives.

The Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce

In the process of socialist revolution, our country did not adopt the method of confiscation for the national capitalist economy, but adopted a policy of peaceful transformation, which is the redemption policy envisioned by Marx and Lenin. Due to their own interests, China's national bourgeoisie has both revolutionary and compromising sides in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism during the democratic revolution. The Party correctly implemented the correct policy of both unity and struggle, seeking unity through struggle, and finally won them over to the people's democratic united front. During the socialist revolution, the national bourgeoisie, in the face of the superior strength of the working class and the socialist economy, still had two sides: accepting the leadership of the working class and opposing the leadership of the working class, accepting socialist transformation and resisting socialist transformation. The Party continued to implement the policy of both unity and struggle, seeking unity through struggle, and finally won over the national bourgeoisie to accept socialist transformation in about seven years without too much reluctance.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government adopted a policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation towards capitalist industry and commerce; that is, utilizing its aspects that were beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, restricting its aspects that were detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood, and gradually carrying out socialist transformation through various forms of state capitalism. During the period of national economic recovery, socialist state-owned industry was not strong enough, and its products could not fully meet the needs of national construction and people's lives; state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives were also impossible to undertake all the tasks of urban and rural exchange. At this time, capitalist industry and commerce still played a certain positive role in the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production and the supply of people's living needs, and this positive role must be fully utilized. However, if the bourgeoisie's profit-only nature and the anarchy of the capitalist economy are not restricted, they will disrupt the market, undermine national plans, and cause serious damage to the interests of the people. The series of struggles mentioned earlier, from stabilizing prices to the "Five-Anti" movement, fully illustrate that this struggle between restriction and anti-restriction is a very fierce and very complex class struggle.

China's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce also adopted a policy of gradual transition, first transforming the private capitalist economy into a state capitalist economy, and then transforming the state capitalist economy into a socialist economy. The development of China's state capitalist economy has gone through two stages, that is, from the primary form of processing orders to the advanced form of joint state-private ownership. Adopting this gradual transition method can also enable the national bourgeoisie to gradually recognize the superiority of the socialist economy and the necessity of taking the socialist road based on their own experience, so that they can accept the transformation without too much reluctance.

The primary form of state capitalism is processing orders in industry and distribution and sales agency in commerce. As early as 1950, when the Party and the government adjusted private industry and commerce, the processing order system began to be established in capitalist industry. For private industry, processing orders do not change the original ownership of the means of production and the management system, but can ensure the supply of raw materials and the sale of products; and because the government stipulates reasonable processing fees and prices, their legal profits can also be guaranteed, so this system is easily accepted by industrial capitalists. For the state, through processing orders, it begins to incorporate the production of private industry into the track of national planning, and restricts the profits of capitalists to a certain range through processing fees and prices. Therefore, this form has been widely developed during the restoration period. Distribution and sales agency in commerce mainly began to be established from 1954. From the end of 1953, the state gradually implemented a planned supply system for food, edible oil, and cotton cloth. Most of the retail stores that originally operated these commodities were transformed into distribution stores or sales agency stores of state-owned commerce; thereafter, distribution and sales agency gradually developed in other industries.

The primary form of state capitalism is the cooperation between the state and private enterprises outside the enterprise. This cooperation cannot completely resolve the contradiction between the state economy and the private economy, nor can it completely incorporate the production and operation of the private economy into the national plan. When the state-owned economy becomes increasingly strong, this contradiction between public and private will also become increasingly developed. The way to solve the contradiction is to raise the lower form of state capitalism to the higher form, that is, to implement joint state-private ownership.

As early as in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, some private enterprises had shares of counter-revolutionaries. After these shares were confiscated according to law, these enterprises became joint state-private ownership. During the period of national economic recovery, some private enterprises also required government investment to become joint state-private ownership because they were unable to continue operating or needed to expand their production scale but were unable to invest. However, until 1953, joint state-private ownership enterprises had not developed much. In this year, there were only more than 1,000 joint state-private ownership factories, and its output value accounted for 5.7% of the total industrial output value. The large-scale development of joint state-private ownership enterprises only began in 1954. At that time, due to the rapid development of the state-owned economy, the contradiction between the state-owned economy and the capitalist economy became increasingly acute. Capitalist industry and commerce had many internal and external contradictions due to backward management, and it became an obstacle to the continued development of productive forces that could not be ignored. Therefore, the state began to adopt a policy of actively developing joint state-private ownership. Private enterprises saw that state-owned enterprises and joint state-private ownership enterprises were thriving, while they themselves had many difficulties, and more and more of them requested joint state-private ownership. By 1955, the output value of joint state-private ownership factories had accounted for 16% of the total industrial output value, which was roughly equal to the output value of capitalist industry that continued to be privately owned at that time.

Joint state-private ownership of individual enterprises cannot completely resolve the contradiction between the state-owned economy and the private economy. On the contrary, it makes the difficulties of the remaining non-joint-venture private enterprises more and more difficult, and it is more and more difficult for the state to make overall arrangements. Most of these non-joint-venture enterprises are very small in scale and technically very backward. In 1955, the state adopted a policy of using the large to bring the small and using the advanced to bring the backward to make overall arrangements for private enterprises; however, the private ownership system of the means of production made it difficult for such a policy to be fully effective. In order to make overall arrangements, the state needs to merge and reorganize some enterprises that are too small and too backward; based on the private ownership of the means of production, such adjustments are obviously difficult to carry out completely. The most effective way to solve the difficulty is to further improve from individual joint state-private ownership to joint state-private ownership of the entire industry.

In the winter of 1955, in the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, the national bourgeoisie felt more and more isolated. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to the bourgeoisie the bright future of the country and individuals at the meeting of representatives of the bourgeoisie, encouraged them to further accept socialist transformation, and was determined to completely transform themselves into glorious self-reliant workers. Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions made bourgeois elements further recognize their future. Therefore, in January 1956, following the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, the upsurge of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce also began to appear. The industrial and commercial circles of major cities have applied to the government for joint state-private ownership in the entire industry. By the end of 1956, almost all of the country's private capitalist industry and commerce had become joint state-private ownership, and some small factories and small shops had basically completed cooperativization. In this way, in the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, the road of socialism has won a decisive victory.

After joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, the private shares of capitalists were changed to a fixed interest system; that is, regardless of the amount of profit or loss of the enterprise, a fixed interest of 5% is given to the private shares every year. From then on, the capitalists of these joint state-private ownership enterprises no longer care about the surplus or deficit of the enterprise, and can be completely managed by the state according to socialist principles, so that they completely obey the command of the national plan, and are merged and reorganized according to the needs of the state; except that the capitalists still take fixed interest, there is not much difference from ordinary state-owned enterprises. The capital personnel in the original enterprise are appropriately arranged by the state and become enterprise management personnel appointed by the government, but in matters related to public-private relations, they still represent the interests of private shares. After an appropriate period, the fixed interest can be cancelled after consultation between the state and private personnel. During this period, after the bourgeois elements have undergone socialist ideological transformation, after the cancellation of fixed interest, they will gradually transform into self-reliant workers.

In 1956, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production was basically completed, and we achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front. Under China's specific conditions, due to the adoption of a policy of peaceful transformation, the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals still occupy a certain position in society, and the influence of bourgeois ideology is naturally very difficult to eliminate quickly. The victory of our socialist revolution on the economic front, if not added to the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, then the victory we have already obtained is not solid. The struggle against bourgeois rightists and the people's rectification movement led by the Party in 1957 were great revolutions on the political and ideological fronts. After this struggle, China's socialist revolution achieved a decisive victory. In the future, in addition to continuing to combat the various anti-socialist conspiracies of imperialists and domestic exploiting classes, it is also necessary to carry out arduous ideological transformation work on the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, continue to overcome the capitalist spontaneous tendencies of wealthy middle peasants, and constantly strengthen political and ideological education to improve the socialist ideological awareness of the working people, so as to achieve a complete victory in our socialist revolution.

The Characteristics of Socialist Transformation in China

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have resolutely chosen the road of socialism. The facts of the past ten years have fully proved that this choice is completely correct. Only socialism can enable the Chinese people to rely on their own labor to get rid of hunger and cold and create a bright and happy future for themselves. Now, socialism is not only the great ideal of the Chinese people, but it has gradually become the reality of life for the Chinese people.

China's socialist transformation is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and basically follows the road that the Soviet Union has taken. However, since China's historical conditions and economic situation are not exactly the same as those of the Soviet Union, the specific process of socialist transformation in China during the transition period also has differences from the Soviet Union.

Now we can see very clearly: after the victory of the proletarian revolution, it is necessary to go through a transition period from capitalism to socialism, which is common to all countries. During the transition period in various countries, from an economic point of view, there will be economic components such as socialism, capitalism, and individual economy, and at the same time there will be classes such as the proletariat, the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie. Politically speaking, the transition period is the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat that has seized power relies on the alliance with the peasants and other laborers to carry out the dictatorship over the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, which is the fundamental issue in the political life of the transition period. The task of the proletariat during the transition period is to overcome the bourgeoisie's resistance to the socialist revolution, eliminate capitalism and all other systems of exploitation, transform the individual economy of small private owners, carry out socialist construction, and gradually improve people's lives on the basis of developing production. All of these are common to all countries during the transition period.

In addition to these common things, China's socialist transformation during the transition period also has some of its own characteristics and our own experience, which are:

First, China is carrying out socialist revolution immediately on the basis of the victory of the democratic revolution. Due to China's special historical reasons, the representatives of China's national bourgeoisie participated in the people's democratic power led by the working class after the victory of the revolution; therefore, China must not only adopt a policy of peaceful transformation for the individual economy of peasants and handicraftsmen, but also adopt a policy of peaceful transformation for the national capitalist economy. Implementing peaceful transformation of the capitalist economy does not mean that the working class and the bourgeoisie can enter socialism peacefully without struggle. This is impossible. The central issue in China's transition period is still the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and the struggle between the two classes of the working class and the bourgeoisie. However, this struggle has taken on special and more complex forms.

China's democratic revolution was victorious under the leadership of China's Communist Party, the vanguard of the working class. After the victory of the revolution, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance was established. This regime is essentially a special form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Although China's people's democratic regime also has the participation of the bourgeoisie, the Communist Party and the working class have firmly grasped the political leadership. This enables the people's democratic regime not only to continue to complete the tasks that the democratic revolution has not yet completed, but also to resolutely implement the socialist revolution program put forward by the Communist Party and the working class, and carry out socialist transformation of the individual economy and the capitalist economy. China's constitution is a constitution of socialist revolution that is suitable for China's characteristics; the constitution incorporates the general line of the transition period proposed by the Party into the preamble of the constitution, as the general task of the country during the transition period. This constitution was unanimously adopted by the National People's Congress, including representatives of the bourgeoisie, after repeated consultations.

After the victory of the democratic revolution, China's working class not only grasped the political power, but also, due to the deprivation of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, the state of the working class grasped the most important economic lifeline of the country. Although China's capitalist economy did not fully develop in the past, during the more than 20 years of rule by the Kuomintang reactionaries, a fairly strong state monopoly capitalist economy (bureaucratic capital) had been established. The bureaucratic bourgeoisie controlled the most important part of the capitalist economy, and its power had surpassed the national bourgeoisie. When these bureaucratic capitalist enterprises fell into the hands of the state led by the working class and transformed into a socialist economy, it could fully exert the superiority of socialism, thereby quickly defeating the national capitalist economy and gaining the leading position in the national economy. This is another important guarantee for the successful completion of China's socialist transformation. If there is only political advantage and no economic advantage, in other words, if China's economic lifeline is still in the hands of the bourgeoisie, then it may not be possible to peacefully complete the socialist transformation.

The political and economic alliance between workers and peasants is another important guarantee for the bourgeoisie to accept socialist transformation. China's working class has established a solid political alliance with the peasants in the long democratic revolution. After the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the Party and the government not only continued to lead the peasants to completely complete the land reform, but also universally established supply and marketing

    我国国民经济的社会主义改造
    薛暮桥
    我国国民经济的社会主义改造，从1949年开始，到1956年基本完成，经过七、八年时间。
    旧中国是一个半殖民地半封建的社会。要把这样一个社会改变为社会主义社会，必须经过两次革命，即民主主义革命和社会主义革命。中华人民共和国的成立，标志着民主主义革命的胜利完成，和社会主义革命的开始。两个革命并不能够截然分开；事实上，民主主义革命的一部分任务（如晚解放区的土地改革）是在中华人民共和国成立以后二三年内继续完成的；而社会主义革命的一部分任务（如工人阶级领导的政权和社会主义国营经济的建立）则在中华人民共和国成立前，就在已经解放的地区开始进行了。
    在旧中国的国民经济中占统治地位的，是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义经济。在城市中，占统治地位的是以蒋宋孔陈四大家族为首的买办性、封建性的国家垄断资本主义经济，在农村中占统治地位的是封建地主阶级的经济；而帝国主义则通过官僚资产阶级和地主阶级而维持它们对中国经济的控制。人民民主革命的胜利，没收了官僚资本和地主阶级的土地，从而消灭了官僚资产阶级和地主阶级这两个帝国主义在中国的代理人，同时又取消了帝国主义在中国的一切特权，帝国主义对中国的经济控制也就随之消灭了。这样，中国就从半殖民地、半封建国家，变成新民主主义的国家，即从资本主义向社会主义过渡中的国家。
    社会主义国营经济领导地位的确立
    随着工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的建立，中国人民没收官僚资本主义企业，把它变为全民所有的财产，并在这些企业中进行民主改革和生产改革，实行社会主义的经营管理制度，这样就产生了崭新的、强大的社会主义国营经济。
    当时同社会主义国营经济并存的，还有为数较多的民族资本主义经济，和为数更多的农民和手工业者的个体经济。社会主义国营经济掌握着全国最重要的经济命脉（包括大部分现代化的工业和交通运输业），但在战争中受严重破坏，它在数量上还不占优势，当时在数量上占优势的是民族工商业，特别是像汪洋大海那样包围着我们的个体农业和个体手工业。我国民族资产阶级的大部分虽然在人民民主革命中参加了反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人民民主统一战线，或者对革命和反革命的斗争采取中立的态度，但是他们抱着发展资本主义的强烈愿望，是不愿意看到社会主义在中国土地上的胜利的。中国的农民在长期的人民民主革命中同工人阶级结成了亲密的联盟，他们中的贫苦阶层经过教育，是会愿意走社会主义道路的；但他们中的比较富裕的阶层（富裕中农），或多或少地存在着发展资本主义的要求。
    在这时期我国的主要矛盾，已经是社会主义经济同资本主义经济的矛盾，工人阶级同资产阶级的矛盾。在中华人民共和国成立前夕和初成立的时候，资产阶级在中国共产党和工人阶级强大的军事、政治力量前面，虽然不得不承认党和工人阶级在政治上的领导地位；但是，资产阶级认为自己在经济上还占优势，他们是决不愿意放弃这种优势地位的。当时的经济斗争，主要表现在市场物价方面。民族资产阶级，特别是它们中的投机资本，利用国民党反动政府十几年的通货膨胀所造成的市场混乱局面，趁着人民解放战争尚未完全结束，国家的财政经济情况尚未稳定的机会，疯狂地进行投机屯积，哄抬物价，牟取暴利。中央人民政府一成立，就立即同投机资本展开了激烈的斗争。党和政府看到，如果不彻底粉碎投机资本的猖狂进攻，就不可能把物价稳定下来。而物价如果不稳定，则工农业生产和城乡贸易的恢复，以及人民生活的安定，就都难于实现。
    1950年第一季中央人民政府开始统一管理全国的财政经济工作，集中国家所掌握的一切经济力量，紧缩通货，平抑物价。到同年3月就迅速地把物价稳定下来，从而结束了旧中国十几年来由于通货膨胀所造成的市场混乱局面。在稳定物价的斗争中，投机资本受到了沉重的打击。
    物价稳定以后，由于通货膨胀所造成的虚假购买力突然消失，许多被屯积的物资竞向市场抛售，这样就使多年来习惯于投机屯积的私营工商业也遇到了严重的困难。中央人民政府为着迅速恢复国民经济，立即进行调整工商业的工作，通过收购和加工订货等办法，把当时还符合于国家和人民需要的私营工商业从停工歇业中迅速挽救出来，使它们都能够在国营经济的领导下，进行正常的生产和经营。调整工商业的工作一方面帮助资本主义工商业克服了暂时的困难，另一方面又通过加工订货等类措施，把重要的私营工业置于国营经济的领导之下，并把它们的生产逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道。
    1950年第三季度调整工商业的工作胜利完成了，国家为着加速工农业生产的恢复，又开始进行大规模的城乡物资交流运动。城乡物资交流，一方面扩大了各种农产品和土产品的销路，从而刺激着农业和各种副业生产的发展；另方面又提高了农民的购买力，为城市工业品开辟了广大的市场，从而刺激着工业生产的恢复和发展。在此同时，国家在广大的农村中普遍建立供销合作社，在国营商业的领导和支援下，从事农副业产品的收购工作，并供应农民所需要的各种生产资料和消费品。这样，国营商业既通过加工订货控制了大量的工业品，又通过供销合作社控制了大量的农产品，从而大大地巩固了自己在全国市场上的领导地位。
    1951年城市工商业出现了欣欣向荣的新气象，工商业资本家利用这个有利时机，企图摆脱国营经济对它们的控制。但是，在主要的工农业产品大部分已经被国营商业掌握起来的情况下，他们已经不可能同国营经济在市场上进行公开的、合法的斗争。他们通过当时国家机关和国营企业大量接收下来的旧人员，用贿赂来腐蚀我们机关和企业的干部，进行偷税漏税等各种违法活动。1952年初，党和政府为着击退资产阶级的这一个猖狂进攻，首先在国家机关和国营企业中进行“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义”的斗争，接着又对私营工商业进行“反行贿、反偷税漏税、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家财产和盗窃国家经济情报”的斗争。这一个轰轰烈烈的“三反、五反”运动，在工人阶级的热烈支持下，取得了巨大的胜利。民族资产阶级认识了社会主义是不可抗拒的潮流，因而他们就不能不接受工人阶级和国营经济的领导，而且他们中的少数进步分子开始愿意接受社会主义改造。
    从1949年到1952年，是我国国民经济的恢复时期。在短短的三年多时间中，我国不但胜利地实现了工农业生产的恢复和发展，而且使社会主义国营经济在国民经济中的领导地位巩固地建立起来。在这期间，社会主义工业在工业总产值中所占的比重，从34.7％上升到56％，到1952年，国家对私营工业的加工订货，也占私营工业总产值的56％。在商业方面，从1950年到1952年，国营商业在批发额中所占比重，从23.2％上升到60.5％，国营商业和供销合作社在零售额中所占的比重，从11.6％上升到34.4％。在农村中，不但供销合作社已经普遍建立起来，而且生产方面的互助合作运动也有了初步的发展。
    1953年我国在恢复时期已经取得的巨大成就的基础上，开始进入大规模、有计划的社会主义经济建设时期。这一年，党中央根据当时的政治经济形势和广大人民的要求，宣布了我国过渡时期的总路线，就是要逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。总路线的宣布使广大劳动人民欢欣鼓舞，不但加速了我国的经济文化建设，而且也加速了我国国民经济的社会主义改造事业。
    个体农业和手工业的合作化
    我国农民在共产党的领导下，在大约十年时间内，完成了土地改革和农业合作化两次大革命。早在解放战争时期，我国解放区的农民就在党的领导下进行了土地改革。全国解放以后，土地改革迅速推广到新解放的地区，到1952年除某些少数民族地区外，已在全国范围胜利完成。土地改革大大地提高了农民生产的积极性，使遭受十多年战争破坏的我国的农业生产，迅速地恢复并超过了历史上的最高水平。
    土地改革虽然在很大的程度上解放了农业的生产力，但是土地改革后的农业仍然建立在个体经济基础上，如果不进一步实现合作化，仍难使生产力得到最大的解放。早在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志就在“论合作社”一文中指出，在改革了封建土地关系以后，还要进行第二个革命，就是农业的合作化。当时，党和革命政府就利用农民原有的变工互助的习惯，帮助农民建立变工队或互助组等组织。随着抗日战争和解放战争的胜利，这种互助合作组织开始在全国各地发展起来。1951年底，中共中央作出了“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，指导农民广泛组织临时的和常年的互助组，并在有条件的地区有重点地发展半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，到1952年参加互助组的农户，已经占农户总数的40％。
    互助组是建筑在个体经济基础上的集体劳动组织，参加互助组的农民仍然以一家一户为生产单位，但是用换工的形式组织起来共同劳动，并交换使用各自的耕畜和农具。农民组织起来以后，由于劳动力和耕畜农具得到比较合理的使用，在一定程度上克服了个体经济的困难，使农业生产得到进一步的发展。在我国的具体条件下，互助组是农业合作化的初级形式，它已经具有社会主义的萌芽。但是，互助组还是建立在个体经济的基础上，存在着个体经营同集体劳动之间的矛盾。因而土地的合理经营，劳动力、耕畜和农具的合理使用，仍然要受到各个农户的个体经营的限制。因此，为着农业生产力的进一步发展，要求农业的合作化进一步提高，即从互助组发展到半社会主义的农业生产合作社。（初级合作社）
    在互助组的发展过程中，半社会主义的农业生产合作社就已经开始试办。1953年12月，中共中央又作出了“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”，决定以发展农业生产合作社为中心来推动互助合作运动的继续前进。在1953年秋收时，全国已经有半社会主义的农业生产合作社一万五千多个，1954年秋收时发展到十一万四千多个，1955年6月又发展到六十五万个，入社农户共一千六百九十万户，约占全国农户总数的14％。
    半社会主义的农业生产合作社，土地仍归各户私有，但是由合作社统一经营，各户私有的耕畜和大农具也交给合作社统一使用。合作社的产品，归参加合作社的社员共同所有，在扣除了生产中的开支和缴纳农业税、提取若干公积金、公益金后，大部分按社员所提供的劳动数量进行分配，小部分按社员入社的土地数量进行分配，社员交给合作社使用的耕畜和大农具也要取得一定的报酬。这种合作社，从土地集体经营，劳动成果的主要部分实行按劳分配，有了公共财产（公积金、公益金和社员入社的股份基金）等这些方面来讲，是属于社会主义性质的。但是土地和大部分的耕畜农具还归各户私有，在劳动分红外还有土地分红和其它私有生产资料的报酬，因而还保留着私有制度的因素。这种半社会主义的合作社在生产中公共财产的积累逐渐增加，一部分私有的耕畜和大农具逐渐折价归公，从而逐步地增加社会主义的成分。
    半社会主义的农业生产合作社比互助组有更大的优越性，它已经基本上克服了个体经济的分散性，从而使农业的生产力又有进一步的发展。在半社会主义的农业生产合作社迅速发展中，已经有少数基础特别好的合作社在社员的同意下，取消了土地分红，把耕畜和大农具完全折价归公，从而由半社会主义的合作社上升为社会主义性质的合作社（高级合作社）。
    1955年7月毛泽东同志作了“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，批评和纠正了当时党内一部分同志对农业合作化的右倾保守思想，指出农业合作化的高潮在一部分地区已经到来，在全国范围也即将到来。前面所说的两个决议特别是毛泽东同志的报告，为我国的合作化规定了正确的政策和方针，规定了正确的阶级路线，从而保证农业合作化迅速地、而且健全地向前发展。正如毛泽东同志所指出的那样，就在1955年的冬天，农业合作化的高潮就在全国范围出现了。1955年底，农业生产合作社的入社农户达到七千五百多万户，占全国农户总数的63％。到1956年的年底，入社农户已占农户总数的92.8％，其中参加高级社的已占农户总数的63.2％。全国的农业合作化运动，到这时候就基本完成了。
    我国农业合作化的所以能够迅速完成，首先由于我们党不但领导农民彻底地完成了土地改革，而且在土地改革中坚决地执行了群众路线。我们在土地改革中依靠贫农、团结中农，组织群众自己的力量，去同地主富农进行斗争，从而彻底地打垮了地主阶级，削弱了富农，并大大地提高了群众的觉悟，这样就为我们党进一步领导农民进行农业的合作化，准备好了极有利的条件。
    合作化的所以能够迅速完成，还由于党在合作化运动中规定了正确的政策方针和阶级路线。党不但采取从低级到高级的各种互助合作形式，把农民一步步地引导到社会主义的道路上来，并且在合作化过程中一贯地坚持自愿和互利的原则。是否参加互助合作组织和参加哪一种形式的互助合作组织，完全由农民自愿决定；组织起来以后在处理贫农和中农的关系上，正确地掌握互利的原则，使大家都不吃亏。在农民参加了互助合作组织以后，或在互助组升为初级社、初级社升为高级社的时候，要保证他们中的90％以上的家庭的收入，都能够依靠农业的增产而有所增加。党在合作化过程中还采取了正确的阶级路线，首先吸收贫农和下中农中的积极分子入社，然后吸收其他农民入社，并保持前两类农民在合作社中的领导权。到合作社完全巩固以后，才个别地吸收富农分子和原来的地主分子入社，从而彻底地消灭地主和富农阶级。
    在农业合作化的同时，我国的手工业也逐步地完成了合作化。我国手工业的合作化，同样也采取了逐步过渡的方针。党和政府根据手工业的商品生产的特点，首先帮助手工业者组织供销小组，集体地向国营商业或供销合作社购买原料，销售成品，参加小组的手工业者仍然独立生产。在供销小组积累了一定的公共财产以后，就可以扩大或合并成为手工业供销合作社，由合作社负责供给原料，销售成品，并开始进行生产中的分工协作。这种供销合作社再进一步发展，就成为集体生产的手工业生产合作社，从而就完成了从个体经济到社会主义集体经济的过渡。手工业的合作组织在国民经济恢复时期还处于重点试办的阶段，1953年起开始大量发展，到1955年底手工业合作社（组）的社员已经发展到二百二十万人，占全国手工业者的27％。1956年初，随着农业合作化高潮的到来，全国手工业者也出现了社会主义改造的高潮。到1956年年底，手工业合作社的社员，已占手工业者总数的90％以上，我国手工业的合作化也基本完成了。
    1956年我国的个体小商业也基本上实现了合作化，为国营商业和供销合作社执行经销代销的业务。
    资本主义工商业的社会主义改造
    我国在社会主义革命过程中，对民族资本主义经济没有采取没收的方法，而采取和平改造的政策，也就是马克思和列宁所设想的赎买政策。我国的民族资产阶级由于他们自身的利益，在民主革命时期的反帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的斗争中，有革命和妥协的两面性。党正确地执行了又团结、又斗争、以斗争求团结的正确政策，终于把他们争取到人民民主统一战线中来。在社会主义革命时期，民族资产阶级在工人阶级和社会主义经济的优势力量前面，仍然有接受工人阶级领导和反对工人阶级领导，接受社会主义改造和抗拒社会主义改造的两面性。党继续执行又团结、又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策，终于争取民族资产阶级在大约七年时间内，不太勉强地接受了社会主义改造。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，党和政府对资本主义工商业，采取利用、限制和改造的政策；即利用其有利于国计民生的方面，限制其不利于国计民生的方面，并通过国家资本主义的各种形式对他们逐步地进行社会主义改造。在国民经济恢复时期，社会主义国营工业还不够壮大，它们的产品还不能充分满足国家建设和人民生活的需要；国营商业和供销合作社也还不可能把城乡交流的任务统统担负起来。在这时候，资本主义工商业对工农业生产的恢复和发展，对人民生活需要的供应，还起着一定的积极作用，这种积极作用必须充分加以利用。但是，资产阶级唯利是图的本质，和资本主义经济的无政府状态，如不加以限制，必将扰乱市场，破坏国家计划，使人民利益受到严重的损失。前面所说的从稳定物价到“五反”运动一系列的斗争，充分地说明了这种限制和反限制的斗争，是一场十分剧烈、十分复杂的阶级斗争。
    我国对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也采取逐步过渡的方针，首先把私人资本主义经济改造成为国家资本主义经济，然后再从国家资本主义经济改造成为社会主义经济。我国国家资本主义经济的发展又经过两个阶段，即从初级形式的加工订货发展到高级形式的公私合营。采取这种逐步过渡的办法，也可以使民族资产阶级根据自身的经验，逐步地认识社会主义经济的优越性和走社会主义道路的必要性，从而能够不太勉强地接受改造。
    国家资本主义的初级形式，在工业中是加工订货，在商业中是经销代销。早在1950年党和政府调整私营工商业的时候，就把加工订货制度在资本主义工业中开始建立起来。加工订货对私营工业来讲，并不改变原来的生产资料所有制和经营管理制度，而可以使原料供应、产品销售得到保障；而且由于政府规定了合理的加工费和货价，它们的合法利润也可以得到保障，所以这种制度容易被工业资本家所接受。对国家来讲，通过加工订货，开始把私营工业的生产纳入国家计划的轨道，而且通过加工费和货价把资本家的利润限制在一定的范围。所以这种形式，在恢复时期就已经得到了广泛的发展。商业中的经销代销，主要是从1954年开始建立起来的。从1953年底起，国家对粮食、食油、棉布等逐步实行计划供应制度，原来经营这些商品的零售店，就大部分转变为国营商业的经销店或代销店；此后，经销代销就在其它行业逐渐发展起来。
    国家资本主义的初级形式是国家同私营企业在企业外部的合作，这种合作并不能够彻底解决国家经济同私营经济之间的矛盾，也不能把私营经济的生产和经营彻底纳入国家计划。到国营经济日益壮大的时候，这种公私之间的矛盾也就日益发展起来。解决矛盾的方法，是把国家资本主义的低级形式提高到高级形式，即实行公私合营。
    早在中华人民共和国初成立的时候，就有一部分私营企业由于有反革命分子的股份，这种股份依法没收以后，这些企业就变为公私合营。在国民经济恢复时期，也有一些私营企业由于无法继续经营，或者需要扩大生产规模自己无力投资，因而要求政府投资变为公私合营。但是直到1953年，公私合营企业还没有很大的发展。这一年公私合营工厂还只有一千多户，它的产值占工业总产值的5.7％。公私合营企业的大量发展，是在1954年才开始的。当时由于国营经济的迅速发展，国营经济同资本主义经济之间的矛盾愈来愈尖锐，资本主义工商业由于经营管理落后内外矛盾重重，愈来愈显得对生产力的继续发展成为一种不容忽视的阻力。因此国家就对公私合营开始采取积极发展的方针。私营企业看到国营企业和公私合营企业欣欣向荣，而自己则困难重重，要求公私合营的也愈来愈多了。到1955年，公私合营工厂的产值已占工业总产值的16％。同当时继续私营的资本主义工业的产值约略相等了。
    个别企业的公私合营并不能够彻底解决国营经济同私营经济之间的矛盾，相反地使剩下来的未合营的私营企业的困难愈来愈多，国家愈难进行统筹安排。这些未合营的企业大多数规模很小，技术也很落后。1955年国家曾经采取以大带小、以先进带落后的方针，对私营企业进行统筹安排；但是生产资料的私有制度使这样的方针很难完全行之有效。为着统筹安排，国家需要对一部分太小和太落后的企业进行合并和改组；在生产资料私有制的基础上，这样的调整显然是很难完全进行的。解决困难的最有效的办法，是从个别的公私合营再提高到全行业的公私合营。
    1955年冬季在农业合作化的高潮中，民族资产阶级感到自己愈来愈孤立。毛泽东同志在资产阶级代表人物的会议上，向资产阶级指出国家和个人的光明前途，鼓励他们进一步接受社会主义改造，下决心把自己彻底改造成为光荣的自食其力的劳动者。毛泽东同志的指示使资产阶级分子进一步认清了自己的前途，因此到1956年1月，继农业合作化的高潮以后，资本主义工商业社会主义改造的高潮也开始出现了。各大城市的工商业界，纷纷全行全业向政府申请公私合营。到1956年年底，全国的私营资本主义工商业几乎全部变为公私合营，一部分小工厂小商店也基本上完成了合作化。这样在社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争中，社会主义的道路就获得了决定性的胜利。
    在全行业公私合营后，对资本家的私股改行定息制度；即不问企业盈利多少，都按私股每年给以5％的定息。从此，这些公私合营企业的资本家就不再关心企业的余亏，可以完全由国家按照社会主义的原则来管理，使它们完全服从国家计划的支配，并按国家的需要来进行合并和改组；除资本家还拿定息外，同一般的国营企业已经没有多大差别。原来企业中的资方人员，则由国家适当安排，变为政府所委派的企业管理人员，不过在有关公私关系的问题上，则仍然代表私股的利益。在经过适当时期以后，就可以经国家和私方人员共同协商，取消定息。在这期间，资产阶级分子经过社会主义思想改造，取消定息以后，他们就将逐步改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    1956年生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成，我们就取得了经济战线上的社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。在我国的具体条件下，由于采取和平改造的方针，资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子在社会上还占有一定的地位，资产阶级思想的影响自然也就很不容易迅速消灭。我们经济战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，如果不再加上政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，那末我们已得到的胜利还是不巩固的。1957年党所领导的反对资产阶级右派的斗争和全民整风运动，是政治战线和思想战线上的伟大的革命。经过这一场斗争，使我国的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利，今后除要继续打击帝国主义者和国内剥削阶级的各种反社会主义的阴谋活动外，还需要对资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子进行艰苦的思想改造工作，继续克服富裕中农的资本主义自发倾向，不断地加强政治思想教育工作，提高劳动人民的社会主义思想觉悟，使我们的社会主义革命取得彻底的胜利。
    我国社会主义改造的特点
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，毅然决然地选择了社会主义的道路。十年来的事实充分证明，这个选择是完全正确的，只有社会主义，才能够使我国人民依靠自己的劳动，来摆脱饥寒交迫的生活，并为自己创造光明和幸福的将来。现在，社会主义已经不仅仅是我国人民的伟大的理想，而且已经逐渐成为我国人民的现实生活了。
    我国的社会主义改造事业，是根据马克思列宁主义的原则，并且基本上沿着苏联所走过的道路进行的。但是，由于我国的历史条件和经济情况与苏联不尽相同，因此我国过渡时期社会主义改造的具体过程，也有与苏联不相同的地方。
    现在我们可以看得很明白：在无产阶级革命胜利之后，必须经历一个从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，这是一切国家所共同的。各个国家在过渡时期中，从经济上说，都会同时存在社会主义、资本主义和个体经济等经济成份，同时存在无产阶级、资产阶级和小资产阶级等阶级。从政治上说，过渡时期是无产阶级专政，取得政权的无产阶级依靠同农民和其他劳动者的同盟，对资产阶级和其他剥削阶级进行专政，是过渡时期政治生活中的根本问题。过渡时期无产阶级的任务，是要克服资产阶级对社会主义革命的反抗，消灭资本主义和其它一切剥削制度，改造小私有者的个体经济，进行社会主义建设，在发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民生活。所有这些，都是一切国家在过渡时期共同的东西。
    除这些共同的东西外，我国过渡时期的社会主义改造也有一些自己的特点和我们自己的经验，这就是：
    第一，我国是在民主革命胜利的基础上，立即进行社会主义革命。由于我国特殊的历史原因，我国民族资产阶级的代表人物，在革命胜利以后参加了工人阶级领导下的人民民主政权；因此我国不但对农民和手工业者的个体经济必须采取和平改造的方针，而且对民族资本主义经济同样也必须采取和平改造的方针。对资本主义经济实行和平改造，并不是意味着工人阶级和资产阶级可以不经斗争，和平进入社会主义，这是不可能的。我国过渡时期的中心问题，仍然是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，工人阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争。不过这种斗争，采取了特殊的，更加复杂的形式罢了。
    我国的民主革命是在工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下取得胜利的。革命胜利以后，建立了工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这个政权，实质上是特殊形式的无产阶级专政。我国的人民民主政权虽然还有资产阶级参加，但是共产党和工人阶级已经巩固地掌握了政治上的领导地位。这样就使这种人民民主政权不但能够继续完成民主革命所未完成的任务，而且能够坚决地执行共产党和工人阶级所提出的社会主义革命纲领，对个体经济和资本主义经济进行社会主义改造。我国的宪法就是一个适合于我国特点的社会主义革命的宪法；宪法把党所提出的过渡时期的总路线载入宪法序言，作为国家在过渡时期的总任务。这个宪法经过反复协商以后，由包括资产阶级代表人物在内的全国人民代表大会所一致通过。
    我国工人阶级在民主革命胜利以后不但掌握了政权，而且由于剥夺了官僚资产阶级，使工人阶级的国家掌握了全国最重要的经济命脉。我国的资本主义经济过去虽然没有充分发展，但在国民党反动派统治的二十多年中，已经建立了一个相当强大的国家垄断资本主义经济（官僚资本）。官僚资产阶级掌握着资本主义经济中的最重要的部分，它的力量已经超过民族资产阶级。当这些官僚资本主义企业落到工人阶级所领导的国家手里，转变成为社会主义经济的时候，它就能够充分发挥社会主义的优越性，从而迅速战胜民族资本主义经济，取得国民经济中的领导地位。这是我国社会主义改造事业能够胜利完成的又一个重要保证。如果只有政治上的优势而没有经济上的优势，换句话说，如果我国的经济命脉还掌握在资产阶级手里，那就不一定能够和平完成社会主义改造事业。
    工人同农民的政治和经济联盟，是使资产阶级接受社会主义改造的又一个重要保证。我国的工人阶级在长期的民主革命中，已经同农民建立了巩固的政治联盟。人民民主革命胜利以后，党和政府不但继续领导农民彻底完成土地改革，而且在农村中普遍建立供销合作社、信用合作社，切断商业和高利贷资本同农民的联系。在农业合作化以后，工人同农民的经济联盟得到进一步的巩固，这样就使资产阶级完全陷于孤立地位，不得不驯服地接受社会主义改造。
    过渡时期社会主义经济同资本主义经济的斗争，首先是从争夺市场领导权的斗争开始的。资本主义经济是最发达的商品经济，它们依靠市场供给原料，依靠市场销售成品，离开了市场，任何一个资本主义企业都不可能继续生产。我们国家由于紧紧地掌握了市场，掌握了一切重要的工业品和农产品，因此不但能够保证社会主义建设的顺利进行和人民生活的逐步改善，而且使资本主义经济不得不接受国营经济的领导，最后又不得不接受社会主义改造。
    第二，我国生产力的水平还比较低，个体经济在国民经济中占绝对的优势，资本主义经济也还占有相当重要的地位。为了顺利地达到和平改造的目的，使我国在生产关系的巨大变革中，社会生产力不致于受到破坏，工农业生产得以迅速发展，我们的社会主义改造就只能采取逐步过渡的方针。
    我国有一亿二千万户农民，八百万独立手工业者和几十万户资本主义工商业。要使几千年来习惯于个体经营的小生产者自愿放弃其虽然数量很少，但一向赖以生存的私人经营，走上合作化的道路，这当然不是一件容易的事情。要使资本家自愿把他们的企业交给国家，放弃剥削生活变成自食其力的劳动者，这更是史无前例的创举。不能想像，我们可以采取急躁的办法，来完成这样伟大的社会主义改造事业，而不使社会生产力受到重大损失。
    我国在逐步地进行社会主义改造的过程中，按照我国的具体情况，灵活地提出了一系列的最能够被广大群众接受的过渡形式；如在农业中的劳动互助组和半社会主义性质的合作社，在工商业中的加工订货、经销代销和公私合营等。这样就可以使农民根据自己的经验，逐步地认识社会主义的优越性，从而积极地参加这一伟大的合作化运动，避免由于突然变化而可能引起的种种损失；使资产阶级同样根据自身的经验，感到非走社会主义道路不可，从而不太勉强地接受社会主义改造，使现代化工业的生产力不致于受到破坏。虽然我们采取了逐步改造的政策，但是我们仍然能够在短短七八年中间，基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。而且在改造过程中，资本主义工业的产值，还增长了一倍上下。农业虽然遇到几次严重的自然灾害，但生产仍然逐年增长；特别是合作化高潮的1955年和1956年，农业生产有着更大的增长。
    第三，我国由于特殊的历史条件，在农业还没有机械化以前就完成了农业的合作化，在国家还没有工业化以前就基本上完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。社会主义改造的胜利完成，为我国生产力的发展创造了极为有利的条件。但是另一方面，在国家工业化和农业机械化还没有实现以前，我国的社会主义制度还缺乏巩固的物质基础。我国人民有必要鼓足干劲，加速社会主义建设，使社会主义制度能够进一步巩固起来。
    1958年在经济战线、政治战线、思想战线所取得的伟大胜利的基础上，在第一个五年计划期间所建立的国家工业化的初步基础上，党中央提出了“鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，在总路线照耀下，我国的工农业生产和其它经济文化事业获得了史无先例的大跃进。我国的五亿多农民，又在合作化以后，进一步完成了更伟大的人民公社运动。1959年我国的国民经济继续跃进，将要提前三年完成第二个五年计划建议原定的1962年的指标。我国的人民公社经过整理巩固，正在对加速社会主义建设发挥更巨大的作用。我们的社会主义制度日益巩固。我们的前途是光芒万丈，充分地证明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性。
    十年来，我国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的共产党的英明领导下，一个斗争接着一个斗争，一个胜利接着一个胜利。党中央和毛泽东同志历来坚持群众路线，不论在革命中，建设中，都依靠群众，充分发挥群众的革命毅力和首创精神，因而不断取得胜利。现在全国人民正在党中央的领导下，继续奋进，努力把我国建设成为有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的、繁荣富强的社会主义国家。
