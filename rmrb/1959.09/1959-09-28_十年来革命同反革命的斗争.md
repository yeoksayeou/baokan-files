    The Struggle Between Revolution and Counter-Revolution Over the Past Decade
    Deputy Premier of the State Council Luo Ruiqing
    The great People's Republic of China has been established for ten years.
    The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has been warmly hailed by the people of the whole country and progressive people all over the world. For the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have waged arduous and heroic struggles and have achieved great achievements on all fronts of revolution and construction. In particular, since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for building socialism, our country's industrial and agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, and the rural areas have realized the people's communes, which has greatly accelerated the pace of our country's socialist advance. Now, the people of the whole country are enthusiastically responding to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continuing to leap forward with the sky-high spirit of moving mountains and seas, and striving to complete the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan this year!
    The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is the greatest event since the Russian October Revolution. It proves that a poor and backward colonial and semi-colonial country, as long as it has the correct leadership of the proletariat's vanguard – the Communist Party – and relies on the strength of the people, can completely liberate itself from the rule of imperialism and reactionary classes; any reactionary forces that seem powerful and ferocious are completely defeatable by the people.
    Of course, the victory of any people's revolution cannot be easily achieved. At the same time, it will inevitably take a lot of effort to consolidate the victories that have been achieved. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of our country, after a long, tortuous, and arduous struggle, thoroughly overthrew the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and established a people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In the long revolutionary struggle, we have a Chinese Communist Party tempered in a hundred battles, a strong People's Liberation Army, and a broad people's democratic united front. After winning nationwide victory, the revolutionary people have been in an absolutely dominant position in the struggle against counter-revolution. Compared with the broad masses of the people, all remnants of counter-revolutionary forces are only a drop in the ocean. However, because China is a large country with a population of 650 million, even if counter-revolutionaries account for only one percent or less of the population, there are still a considerable number. After the Chinese people seized national power, an extremely complex and acute struggle still existed between them and the counter-revolution. This struggle occupied an extremely important position in the first decade of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    We know that in the more than 100 years of aggression against China, imperialism has established countless ties with our country's reactionary classes and reactionaries, and cultivated a large number of lackeys. It is difficult to uproot them all at once. Imperialism was, is, and will continue to be the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people. It will never be reconciled to its expulsion from China. It will inevitably use every means possible to attempt to subvert the people's China and attempt to stage a comeback.
    We know that the Kuomintang reactionaries, since their betrayal of the revolution in 1927, have always been the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. During its more than 20 years of rule, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang brought together the worst of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign reaction, and established a huge reactionary organization of military, political, party, youth league, secret service and other reactionary organizations. For example, at the time of the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group, there were 2 million dispersed armed forces (political bandits) left on the mainland, as well as 600,000 reactionary party and youth league backbone members, and 600,000 secret service agents of various kinds. There was a group of die-hards within the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique, who were the backbone of the counter-revolutionary remnants and determined to be reactionary to the end. After fleeing to Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is still trying its best to use various means to maintain contact with a part of the counter-revolutionaries on the mainland.
    We know that China's feudal class and feudal forces have always been the main reliance of the reactionary rule of imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. In the countryside, they are a trinity of local bullies, bandits, and reactionary secret societies; in the cities, they are a trinity of feudal foremen, gang bosses, and hooligans. This group of people is entrenched in every corner of the country, and there is a considerable number of them. They are the pawns of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, or they are the "little Chiang Kai-sheks" of that place. For many years, no matter what dynasty it was, and no matter whether their masters were the Qing Dynasty emperor, the Northern Warlords, Chiang Kai-shek, or British, Japanese, and American imperialism, they always directly pressed on the heads of the people, lawless and doing all kinds of evil. Many of them are covered with the blood of the people.
    The reactionary forces in China cannot evade responsibility for the monstrous crimes they have committed. The people's hatred for them is deeper than the sea, and their anger is fiercer than fire. After the victory, the people have every reason to demand repayment of this blood debt from them. Any severe punishment given to them would not be excessive. However, the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have the lofty ideal of transforming society and transforming mankind. In order to treat the various counter-revolutionaries differently, in order to punish only the very few who are guilty of the most heinous crimes, and to give the majority of counter-revolutionaries a chance to rehabilitate themselves, the Party and the People's Government have adopted correct policies toward the remnants of counter-revolutionary forces.
    On April 25, 1949, the proclamation of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, signed by Chairman Mao, announced: For all kinds of personnel of the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group, except for war criminals who are incorrigible and counter-revolutionaries who are guilty of the most heinous crimes, all those who do not resist with arms, do not plot sabotage, will not be taken as prisoners, will not be arrested, and will not be insulted. It was also announced that among these personnel, those who have a skill and do not have serious reactionary behavior or serious misdeeds will be given separate employment by the People's Government. In July 1949, Chairman Mao pointed out in his essay "On People's Democratic Dictatorship": "As for people from the reactionary classes and reactionary groups, after their political power has been overthrown, as long as they do not rebel, do not sabotage, and do not make trouble, they are also given land and work, so that they can live and transform themselves through labor to become new people." Such a policy is the greatest humanitarian policy in history.
    The Party and the People's Government implemented such a benevolent and righteous policy, so that many people in the reactionary classes and reactionary groups realized that as long as they obeyed the people's regime, bowed their heads to the people, and confessed their sins, and honestly worked and started anew, they would have a future. In this way, the disintegration and disintegration of the counter-revolution was greatly promoted, some people surrendered to the people, and some people wavered. However, there are also some determined counter-revolutionaries who refuse to accept our policies and insist on their counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.
    In the early days of liberation, those determined counter-revolutionaries colluded with imperialism and carried out frantic sabotage activities. They harassed some areas and opposed the People's Government. Imperialist and Kuomintang secret service agents spread rumors among the people in an attempt to undermine the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and to alienate the unity and cooperation of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations. They sabotaged the people's economic undertakings, collected intelligence, and assassinated revolutionary workers. Soon after, American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, and the sabotage activities of domestic counter-revolutionaries became extremely rampant for a time. In 1955, on the eve of the high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture and handicrafts in our country, the sabotage of the remaining counter-revolutionaries in cities and villages became rampant again. In 1957, when the high tide of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts arrived, the remaining counter-revolutionaries and other anti-socialist forces, in order to cooperate with the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists, their sabotage activities resurfaced.
    Obviously, the task before the Chinese people is to wage a resolute struggle against counter-revolution and completely smash any counter-revolutionary conspiracy to restore and sabotage. Otherwise, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish. In order to consolidate the victory of the revolution and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship; in order to thoroughly liberate the people and liberate the productive forces; in order to clear the obstacles to the revolution and construction and create a safe environment; for ten years, the Party has led the people of the whole country to resolutely launch a struggle against counter-revolution, forming three large-scale and vigorous mass struggle upsurges before and after, and achieved great victories.
    After the nationwide victory, this sharp struggle between revolution and counter-revolution was inevitable and unavoidable. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao had early and wise predictions and sufficient estimates of this situation. In March 1949, on the eve of the nationwide victory, Chairman Mao called on the entire Party at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee to learn to wage open and hidden struggles against domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries. Chairman Mao emphasized that if we do not learn to fight against counter-revolutionaries and win victories in the struggle, "we will not be able to maintain our political power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail." On June 15, 1949, at the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao once again called on people to pay attention to: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure in this land of China." On July 1, 1949, in his essay "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao profoundly elucidated that the revolutionary people must exercise dictatorship over the reactionary classes and reactionary groups. On September 21, 1949, Chairman Mao, in his opening speech at the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, reiterated:
  "Our revolutionary work is not yet finished," "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries...will attempt to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." Later, at every important juncture of the socialist revolution in our country, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao gave wise instructions on the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and correctly led the revolutionary struggle in each period.
    The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's thought on practicing the people's democratic dictatorship (that is, a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat) in our country and correctly leading the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, analyzed the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, correctly applied and developed Marxism-Leninism in the specific conditions of China. When commenting on the Paris Commune of 1871, Marx enthusiastically praised the Paris Commune as "an example of heroic struggle never seen before in history!" At the same time, he also solemnly pointed out that the failure of the Paris Commune "can only be attributed to their 'leniency'." Based on Marx's instructions and the lessons of the Paris Commune, Lenin repeatedly emphasized: "After the proletariat seizes political power, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie does not end, on the contrary, this struggle will become more extensive, more acute, and more cruel." The practice of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country once again proves the complete correctness of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country is the victory of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's correct application and development of Marxism-Leninism.
    The struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country has been carried out in the most resolute, the most correct, and the most thorough manner. In a short period of ten years, it has successfully completed the tasks it should have completed, that is: first, to eliminate the counter-revolutionaries quite thoroughly and smash the enemy's conspiracy to restore; second, to completely destroy the Kuomintang reactionary forces that remain in some backward areas and consolidate the people's democratic regime; third, to further liberate the masses of the people politically and promote the great liberation of the productive forces, the broad masses of the people have improved their political awareness and production enthusiasm in the struggle; fourth, to eliminate the garbage left over from the old society and make the socialist social order more and more stable. All these have ensured the smooth completion of the socialist revolution in our country and ensured the great leap forward in socialist construction.
    What we mean by thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionaries is to ferret out all counter-revolutionaries and give them the treatment they deserve, which does not mean that we will physically eliminate all the counter-revolutionaries who should be punished. Imperialism has viciously slandered us on this issue, and the bourgeois rightists in our country have also clamored loudly. This only proves that they want to scare us and make us afraid to let go of the struggle, so as to preserve the counter-revolutionaries, so as to facilitate their restoration activities. The struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is a sharp class struggle of life and death, which is irreconcilable. Any class struggle will inevitably lead to bloodshed. Not only the dictatorship of the proletariat is like this, but also the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes is like this. The difference is that our dictatorship is a revolution that suppresses counter-revolutionaries, and the majority of the people suppresses the minority of reactionaries; while the dictatorship of the exploiters is the opposite. In order to maintain their dictatorship, the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes have shed a lot of blood of the people. Lenin said in "State and Revolution": "It is obvious that in order to achieve the goal of the exploiting minority always oppressing the exploited majority, extremely cruel and cruel means of suppression must be adopted, and countless bloody tragedies must be created, and such bloodshed events are what mankind has experienced under slavery, serfdom, and wage labor." The dictatorship of the proletariat must suppress the resistance of counter-revolutionaries, and of course it is inevitable that some blood will be shed. However, the nature of this bloodshed is completely different from the bloodshed under the dictatorship of all exploiting classes in the past. The blood shed here is not the blood of the people, but the blood of counter-revolutionaries. Judging from the amount of bloodshed alone, compared with the brutal dictatorship of all exploiting classes in the past and the brutal dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, it is also very little bloodshed. All the slanders of imperialism and bourgeois rightists are despicable and shameless rumors. It is precisely because the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country has been carried out in the most resolute, the most correct, and the most thorough manner, therefore, we have shed the least blood in this struggle.
    In accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have only adopted resolute execution methods for a small number of counter-revolutionaries who are guilty of heinous crimes and must be killed; for the majority of criminals who deserve punishment, even those who deserve death but are not necessarily to be killed, we have adopted the means of labor reform. In our country's criminal law, there is a provision for "sentencing to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, and observing the effect." Imperialism once slandered this as the greatest cruelty, but in fact, we say this is the greatest humanity. Even the criminals understand very well that sentencing to death with a reprieve is the People's Government sparing their lives and giving them one last chance to reform. In fact, criminals who receive this treatment are generally retained. May I ask, has there ever been such a great initiative in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad? Can such a humane law be found in the capitalist world? Our policy of implementing labor reform for counter-revolutionaries and other criminals is not only to completely deprive counter-revolutionaries of the conditions for carrying out sabotage, but more importantly, to completely eliminate the class and ideological roots of counter-revolution and other crimes, so that counter-revolutionaries will not return to the old path of crime after serving their sentences.
    Over the past ten years, through labor production and ideological education, most criminals have been transformed to varying degrees, and a group of criminals have indeed reformed themselves and turned over a new leaf. A group of former bandits, local bullies, secret agents, reactionary party and youth league backbone members, reactionary secret society leaders, and other criminals, not only have their reactionary thoughts been transformed, but many people have also developed labor habits; some who originally had no production knowledge have now become relatively skilled technicians or engineers; those who were originally illiterate are now able to read ordinary books, newspapers, and magazines. These are almost unbelievable miracles, but these are true facts. And in our new society, these are not individual facts.
    There is a criminal in Hebei Province named Wang Lun, who used to be a secret agent of the Second Bureau of the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense. During his imprisonment and labor reform, after political and ideological education, he confessed his guilt and obeyed the law, and actively worked, gradually learning the technology of construction engineering, and now has a technical level equivalent to that of a fourth-grade construction engineer, and has received lenient treatment from the People's Government.
    There is a criminal in Qingdao named Li Zongying, who used to be a police officer for the British imperialists in Hong Kong. He was arrested in Qingdao in 1951 for committing a crime and sentenced to five years in prison. After political education and ideological transformation, he was determined to be reborn and start anew. In labor reform, he learned production technology and improved the machine several times. The People's Government gave him lenient treatment and released him two years early. However, Li Zongying developed feelings for the labor reform machinery factory that gave him his second life, and took the initiative to propose to stay and work. Now he is a skilled fourth-grade technician with a monthly salary of 57 yuan, and he got married in 1954 and had his first child in May 1956, starting a new life.
    The broad masses of the people in our country warmly support and actively support the Party and government's policy of labor reform for criminals. The families of counter-revolutionary criminals are also sincerely grateful to the Party and the government for transforming the prodigals in their families into new people. Thousands upon thousands of letters were sent to Chairman Mao and the People's Government, expressing indescribable excitement and joy. Han Xuemin, a citizen of Tianjin, is the wife of Zhang Quan, a person who was released after serving his sentence. She wrote in a letter: "I have personally seen that the People's Government not only gives humanitarian treatment to criminals in life, but also transforms their reactionary thoughts, turning many useless dregs into useful people. After my husband Zhang Quan was released, we no longer quarrel, and we will use practical actions to thank the Party in the future! The day before yesterday, our whole family took a photo, wanting to make a start to move towards light and happiness as a memorial, and after considering for a long time, there was no suitable object, and finally thought that it should be given to our re-birth parents - the Chinese Communist Party. Now I enclose a photo with the letter, please accept it on behalf of the Party!"
    People can see that people like Wang Lun, Li Zongying, and Zhang Quan, as counter-revolutionary criminals, have been eliminated. However, as self-reliant laborers in the new China, they are not only alive, but they are living well. For socialist construction, these people were originally negative factors that played a destructive role; now, not only are they no longer destructive forces, but they have also been transformed into a member of the new China after being transformed. Turning negative factors into positive factors, this is the thoroughness of our elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and this is the great success of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country!
    Over the past ten years, the victory of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution has greatly promoted the great changes in the social outlook of our country. China has changed from a reactionary, dark, and chaotic country under the rule of the Kuomintang to one of the most advanced, most bright, and most stable countries in the world. Both rural and urban areas have undergone earth-shaking changes.
    Here we might as well recall the dark situation in the countryside of the old China. At that time, the reactionary officials and puppet Baojia chiefs of the Kuomintang demanded grain and money all day long, and drafted laborers; bandits and local bullies ran rampant, killing people, stealing goods, raping, and looting. The broad masses of peasants struggled on the verge of starvation and death. They used such a folk song to describe their tragic situation: "The grain harvested is the landlord's, marrying a wife is the Baojia chief's, raising a son is Lao Jiang's!" After liberation, this tragic day is gone forever. After a series of great reform movements such as rent reduction and deposit refund, eliminating bandits and combating local bullies, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, agricultural cooperativization, and people's communes, the rural areas of the country are already bright and prosperous new socialist rural areas, and 500 million peasants have been completely liberated and are no longer subject to any exploitation and oppression.
    Take Ye County, Henan Province, for example. In the old society, this place was a famous "bandit world." Robberies and murders happened every day and every night. The broad masses of people suffered from the "water, drought, locust, and Tang (Kuomintang warlord Tang Enbo)" disasters, and were extremely poor and miserable. In the great drought of 1942, more than 10,900 people starved to death in the county, and more than 1,600 families starved to death. The tragic scenes of "exchanging children for food and dismantling bones for cooking" were common. It was truly a hell on earth. Today's Ye County has become a paradise on earth. Not only have the warlords been overthrown long ago, but bandits have also disappeared. In the great agricultural harvest of 1958, the grain piled up like mountains in the fields and fields, and no theft cases occurred. This year's great drought was even more serious than the one in 1942, but not only did no one starve to death in the county, but the grain production also increased. After ten years of hard struggle by the people of the county, especially after the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's communes in the past two years, 52 small and medium-sized reservoirs have been built, and each commune has built several factories. There are more than 300 factories in the county, including steel plants, cement plants, agricultural tool factories, and cotton mills. The people of Ye County, like the people of the whole country, have embarked on the road of peace, happiness, and prosperity. From the political and economic development and changes in this county, we can see how great and amazing changes have taken place in the rural areas of our country.
    The cities after liberation, like the rural areas, have also undergone earth-shaking changes.
    The people's capital, Beijing, was the center of successive feudal dynasties and imperialist and warlord rule in the old society. Various counter-revolutionary forces gathered, and the dregs of the old society piled up, making Beijing smoggy and dirty. After liberation, Beijing has become the heart of the motherland. After several social reforms, the city has a new look, and both the political environment and the natural environment have been cleaned up. Since the Great Leap Forward, our capital has been built even more majestic and magnificent, with modern factories standing tall and flowers blooming all over the city. Even those darkest corners in the past are now full of light. The famous Tianqiao used to be a place for hiding dirt and harboring filth, with local bullies covering the sky and hooligans running rampant. It was the world of swindlers, thieves, and hooligans, and good people suffered bullying there. Many good women were humiliated and reduced to prostitutes there. After liberation, after several social reforms and anti-bullying movements, the "six tigers" and "four tyrants" entrenched in Tianqiao, along with all the social dregs, were swept away, the red flag fluttered in Tianqiao, and the masses of the people have been completely liberated.
    Our big city, Shanghai, used to be known to the world as "the paradise of adventurers"; now, it is no longer a "paradise of adventurers," but a paradise for the people. In recent years, not only have robbery cases been eliminated in Shanghai, but theft cases have also rarely occurred. There is a famous amusement park in Shanghai called "The Great World," which used to be a center for the activities of imperialist secret agents, Kuomintang secret agents, hooligans, villains, thieves, swindlers, and prostitutes. It was a famous hell on earth, a source of crime, and a fire pit for those who were insulted and persecuted. Now, after democratic reforms and anti-bullying struggles in "The Great World," evil forces have been uprooted. Dozens of kinds of movies, dramas, and operas are performed for the people every day. It has become a happy home for the working people to rest, entertain themselves, and carry out socialist self-education.
    Of course, such changes are by no means limited to Ye County in Henan Province and Beijing and Shanghai. The vast rural and urban areas of the country are like this. The people of our country live in peace and work happily on the vast land of their motherland. Everyone breathes freely, works freely, works, studies, and lives freely, and is no longer oppressed and bullied by imperialism, reactionary classes, and reactionary elements! "The spring breeze blows thousands of willows, and 600 million Shenzhou are all Shun and Yao," which is a true portrayal of the new China. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the people of the whole country are enthusiastically, energetically, and vigorously promoting the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the sun of the people's communes shines everywhere, and the upsurge of socialist construction is surging thousands of miles away. China today, as Chairman Mao said in his article "Introducing a Cooperative" last April: "The communist spirit is booming across the country. The political awareness of the broad masses is rapidly increasing. ... Never have the people been seen so excited, so determined, and so spirited as they are now. The former exploiting classes are completely trapped in the vast ocean of the working people, and they have to change even if they don't want to. There must be people who will not change until they die and are willing to go to see God with granite brains, but that is not important. All the decaying ideologies and other inapplicable parts of the superstructure are collapsing day by day. It still takes time to completely eliminate these garbage; the trend of these things collapsing has become a certainty." The development of the situation in our country for more than a year has further proved that Chairman Mao's above-mentioned Marxist-Leninist analysis and conclusions are absolutely correct.
    The great victory of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in China is mainly due to the following reasons:
    First, our cause is just, and a just cause is bound to win. The struggle between revolution and counter-revolution represents the greatest interests of the broadest and most oppressed masses of the people, represents the needs of social progress and the development of productive forces, and represents the greatest truth and the highest morality. People can see that the broad masses of the people showed such great resentment and excitement when accusing the counter-revolutionaries of their crimes; showed such great courage and enthusiasm when fighting against the counter-revolutionaries; showed such great joy and encouragement when the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionaries achieved victory; and the success of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution produced such great positive results. All these fully illustrate that the justice of our struggle against counter-revolution is completely in accordance with the laws of nature and human feelings. Therefore, it has won the warm support and support of the people of the whole country and has achieved a great victory. The counter-revolutionaries are just the opposite. They are doing evil and reactionary deeds, opposing the people, endangering the people, betraying the motherland, and trying to hinder the progress of society. They are completely unjust and cannot be tolerated by nature and human feelings. Therefore, they are completely isolated among the people, and the social foundation is shrinking day by day. They are bound to fail.
    Second, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country has the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. After the nationwide victory, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is still a great revolutionary movement, and without the leadership of the Communist Party, it cannot succeed. In leading the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, the Party and Chairman Mao have formulated correct guidelines and policies. This is the principle that our government has always followed: "Raise vigilance, eliminate all secret agents; prevent deviations, and do not wrong a good person" and "If there is a counter-revolution, it must be suppressed, and if there is a mistake, it must be corrected." This is the policy of combining punishment and leniency for counter-revolutionaries, and combining labor reform and ideological education. The amnesty order issued by the President of the People's Republic of China on September 17, 1959, demonstrates the great victory of the Party's policy. It is also the specific application and development of this policy under new historical conditions. After ten years of struggle practice, it has been fully proved that our Party's guidelines are the most correct guidelines; our Party's policies are the most effective policies; and the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is the best leadership. In such an extremely sharp struggle, our Party and Chairman Mao's guidelines, policies, and leadership have always been as clear as the North Star, as brave as a lion, as fair as a scale, as enthusiastic as a flame, and as calm as Mount Tai, showing a magnificent revolutionary spirit and the greatest spirit of seeking truth from facts. The guidelines and policies formulated by our Party and Chairman Mao in the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, as well as the art of leadership in actual struggle, fully embody the powerful vitality of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. The wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is the decisive key to the great victory of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country.
    Third, the great victory of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country is the victory of 650 million people. The fundamental line of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country is the line of mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is the cause of the people's thorough liberation of themselves, and it is a great revolutionary mass movement. To defeat and thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionaries, it is impossible to succeed without relying on the masses and without letting go of mobilizing the broad masses to rise up and struggle. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country has always adhered to the mass line, combining mass struggles with the work of specialized agencies. Facts have proved that the mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries line is the most correct, the most revolutionary, the most thorough, and the most guaranteed line. It is precisely because we have implemented the mass line that our victory is great, the deviations are small, the time is short, and the results are extremely rapid. Our experience successfully shows that by implementing the mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries line, the prestige of the counter-revolutionaries is quickly overthrown, and the people's awareness is quickly improved. In the future, as long as there are still counter-revolutionaries, and there is still a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, we must adhere to the mass line. The leadership of the Party and the mass line are the red flag of victory. We must hold this glorious banner high until the complete elimination of class struggle and the complete victory of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution!
    Now, the situation at home and abroad is very good, and the situation of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in our country has undergone fundamental changes. The forces of revolution are developing rapidly, and the remaining counter-revolutionaries are already in a desperate situation of being dying. They are bound to be completely eliminated. However, despite this, the struggle is not over. There are still classes and class struggles in the country, there are still some anti-socialist forces, and there is still imperialism abroad. The enemy has been greatly weakened, but has not been completely eliminated. They are still not willing to give up and are continuing to step up various conspiracies. Recently, our People's Public Security Organs have successively captured secret agents and spies sent in by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and at the same time, they have also cracked a number of current sabotage cases by domestic remnants of counter-revolutionaries. These facts all tell us that we must not be arrogant and underestimate the enemy, make ourselves numb, relax our vigilance, and relax the struggle.
    All the remaining counter-revolutionaries are actually the running dogs of imperialism, and some counter-revolutionary sabotage activities are incited behind the scenes by imperialism, especially American imperialism. At a press conference on June 18, 1958, US President Eisenhower openly stated that the United States should strengthen its subversive and destructive activities against the countries of the socialist camp. He said that "what the United States is doing now" is to "build centrifugal forces within" the socialist camp, and openly admitted that "the United States has done a lot of work in this regard." On January 14, 1959, Eisenhower said the following about China at the US National Press Club: "If the CCP continues on its current course, the United States must indeed pay attention." Openly expressing the desire to "create a wave on the mainland of China." In this way, Eisenhower, in the capacity of a head of state, raised the subversive and destructive activities against the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries to the level of national policy. The Chinese people "must indeed pay attention" to this dangerous line that the United States is currently continuing to implement.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have successfully carried out the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution in the past ten years and have quite thoroughly eliminated the counter-revolutionaries; then, it can be asserted that the future destiny of all counter-revolutionaries will never be better than the past ten years. In the face of the powerful Chinese people with high revolutionary vigilance and rich struggle experience, any destructive conspiracies of imperialism and reactionaries will never succeed.

    十年来革命同反革命的斗争
    国务院副总理　罗瑞卿
    伟大的中华人民共和国的建立，已经十周年了。
    中国人民大革命的伟大胜利，得到了全国人民和全世界进步人类的热烈欢呼。十年以来，我国各族人民，在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，进行了艰巨的英勇的斗争，在革命和建设的各个战线上，都取得了巨大的成就。特别是1958年以来，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，我国工农业生产实现了史无前例的大跃进，全国农村实现了人民公社化，这就大大地加快了我国社会主义前进的步伐。现在，全国人民正在热烈响应党的八届八中全会的伟大号召，以移山造海的冲天干劲，继续跃进，为在今年完成第二个五年计划的主要指标而奋斗！
    中国人民大革命的胜利，是俄国十月革命之后最伟大的事件。它证明了一个贫穷的落后的殖民地半殖民地国家，只要有了无产阶级的先锋队——共产党的正确领导，依靠人民群众的力量，就完全可以从帝国主义和反动阶级的统治下解放出来；任何看来是强大和凶恶无比的反动势力，都是完全可以被人民打败的。
    当然，任何人民革命的胜利，都不是轻易可以取得的。同时，要巩固已经取得的胜利，必然还要花费很大的力气。我国人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过长期的曲折的艰苦的斗争，彻底地推翻了帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治，建立了工人阶级领导的、工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权。我们在长期的革命斗争中，有了一个百炼成钢的中国共产党，有了一支强大的人民解放军，有了一个广泛的人民民主统一战线。革命的人民在取得全国胜利以后，同反革命的斗争，就一直处于绝对主动的地位。一切反革命的残余势力同人民群众相比，只不过是沧海一粟。但是，由于中国是一个有六亿五千万人口的大国，反革命分子在人口中即使只占百分之一，或者少于百分之一，也还有相当数量。中国人民在取得全国政权以后，同反革命之间仍然存在着极其复杂极其尖锐的斗争。这场斗争，在中华人民共和国成立的第一个十年中，占有极其重要的地位。
    我们知道，帝国主义在侵略中国的一百多年中，同我国的反动阶级和反动派，建立了千丝万缕的联系，培养了大批的走狗。要想把它们一下子斩草除根，是困难的。帝国主义过去是、现在是、将来也还是中国革命和中国人民最凶恶的敌人。它对于自己被赶出中国，是决不甘心的。它必然要用尽一切办法，妄想颠覆人民的中国，妄想卷土重来。
    我们知道，国民党反动派从1927年叛变革命以后，就一直是中国人民的死对头。蒋介石的国民党在它二十多年的统治期间，集古今中外反动之大成，建立了庞大的军事、政治、党团、特务等各种反动组织。例如：在国民党反动统治崩溃的时候，留在大陆上的溃散武装（政治土匪）就有二百万，还有反动党团骨干分子六十万，各种特务分子六十万。国民党反动统治集团中是有一批死党的，他们是反革命残余势力中的骨干，决心反动到底。蒋介石集团在逃到台湾以后，还在竭力采取各种方式，同大陆一部分反革命分子保持联系。
    我们知道，中国的封建阶级和封建势力，从来就是帝国主义和官僚资产阶级反动统治的主要依靠。它们在农村是恶霸、土匪、反动会道门三位一体；在城市是封建把头、帮会头子和流氓地痞三位一体。这批人盘踞在全国各个角落，有一个相当大的数量。他们是帝国主义和国民党反动统治的爪牙，或者就是那块地方的“小蒋介石”。多少年以来，不管是什么朝代，也不管他们的主人是清朝皇帝、北洋军阀、蒋介石，或者是英国、日本、美国帝国主义，他们总是照旧直接压在人民的头上，无法无天，无恶不作。其中有很多人，混身都沾满了人民的鲜血。
    中国的反动势力，对于他们自己所做出的滔天罪恶，是不能逃避责任的。人民对他们的仇恨，比海还要深，对他们的愤怒，比火还要强烈。人民在胜利以后，完全有理由向他们讨还这一笔血债。给予他们任何严厉的处罚，都是不过分的。但是，在中国共产党领导下的中国人民，是抱有改造社会，改造人类的崇高理想的。为了区别对待各种不同情况的反革命分子，为了只惩办罪大恶极的少数分子，给多数反革命分子一个自新赎罪的机会，党和人民政府对于反革命残余势力，采取了正确的政策。
    1949年4月25日，由毛主席签署的中国人民解放军总部布告曾经宣布：对于国民党反动统治集团的各种人员，除了怙恶不悛的战争罪犯及罪大恶极的反革命分子外，凡不持枪抵抗，不阴谋破坏者，一律不加俘虏，不加逮捕，不加侮辱。并且宣布，这些人员中，凡有一技之长而无严重的反动行为或严重劣迹者，人民政府给予分别录用。1949年7月，毛主席在“论人民民主专政”的论文中指出：“对于反动阶级和反动派的人们，在他们的政权被推翻以后，只要他们不造反，不破坏，不捣乱，也给土地，给工作，让他们活下去，让他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。”这样的政策，是历史上从来未有过的最伟大的人道主义的政策。
    党和人民政府实行了这样仁至义尽的政策，使反动阶级和反动派中的许多人认识到，只要服从人民政权，向人民低头悔罪，老老实实地劳动，重新作人，就是有前途的。这样，就大大地促进了反革命内部的分化瓦解，一部分人向人民投降，一部分人发生了动摇。但是，也有一些坚决的反革命分子，拒绝接受我们的政策，坚持他们的反革命破坏活动。
    在解放初期，那些坚决反革命分子同帝国主义勾结起来，进行了疯狂的破坏活动。他们在若干地区进行骚扰，和人民政府作对。帝国主义和国民党的特务分子，在人民中散布谣言，企图破坏共产党和人民政府的威信，企图离间各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结和合作。他们破坏人民经济事业，搜集情报，暗杀革命工作人员。不久以后，美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，国内反革命的破坏活动一时极为猖狂。1955年，在我们国家对资本主义工商业、对农业和手工业的社会主义改造高潮的前夕，残余反革命在城市和农村的破坏，又嚣张起来。1957年，在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命高潮到来的时候，残余反革命同其他反社会主义势力为了配合资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻，其破坏活动，又有抬头。
    很明显，摆在中国人民面前的任务，就是必须同反革命进行坚决的斗争，彻底粉碎反革命的任何复辟阴谋和破坏活动。否则革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。为了巩固革命的胜利，巩固人民民主专政；为了彻底解放人民，解放生产力；为了给革命和建设扫清障碍，创造安全的环境；十年以来，党领导全国人民坚决发动了同反革命的斗争，形成了前后三次大规模的轰轰烈烈的群众斗争高潮，取得了伟大的胜利。
    全国胜利以后，革命同反革命这一场尖锐的斗争，是必然的，不可避免的。对于这种形势，党中央和毛主席早有英明的预见和足够的估计。1949年3月，在全国胜利的前夜，毛主席在党的七届二中全会上，就号召全党要学会同国内外反革命做公开的和隐蔽的斗争。毛主席强调地指出，如果我们不去学会同反革命做斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，“我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败”。1949年6月15日，毛主席在政协筹备会首次会议的讲话中，再一次唤起人们注意：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的”。1949年7月1日，毛主席在“论人民民主专政”的论文中，极其深刻地阐明了革命的人民必须对反动阶级和反动派实行专政。1949年9月21日，毛主席在政协第一次全体会议的开幕词中，又重申：
  “我们的革命工作还没有完结”，“帝国主义和国内反动派……将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”。以后，在我国社会主义革命的每一个重要关头，党中央和毛主席对于革命同反革命的斗争，都有英明的指示，正确地领导了每一个时期的革命斗争。
    党中央和毛主席关于在我国实行人民民主专政（即无产阶级专政的一种形式）和正确领导革命同反革命斗争的思想，是分析了无产阶级专政的历史经验，在中国的具体情况下，正确运用和发展了马克思列宁主义。马克思在评论1871年巴黎公社的时候，热情地歌颂了巴黎公社是“历史上还没有过这种英勇奋斗的实例！”同时，他也严正地指出，巴黎公社的失败，“那只能归咎于他们的‘宽大’”。列宁根据马克思的指示和巴黎公社的经验教训，多次地强调指出：“在无产阶级夺取政权以后，无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争并没有终止，相反地，这种斗争会变得更广泛、更尖锐和更残酷。”我国革命同反革命斗争的实践，再一次证明了马克思列宁主义普遍真理的完全正确。我国革命同反革命斗争的胜利，就是党中央和毛主席正确地运用和发展马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    我国革命同反革命的斗争，是进行得最坚决，最正确，也是最彻底的。在短短的十年中，胜利地完成了它应当完成的任务，这就是：一，相当彻底地肃清了反革命，粉碎了敌人的复辟阴谋；二，彻底地摧毁了残存在若干落后地区的国民党反动势力，巩固了人民民主政权；三，在政治上进一步解放了人民群众，促进了生产力的大解放，广大人民在斗争中提高了政治觉悟和生产积极性；四，扫除了旧社会遗留下来的垃圾，使社会主义的社会秩序日益安定。所有这些，就保障了我国社会主义革命的顺利完成，保障了社会主义建设大踏步地向前跃进。
    我们所说的彻底肃清反革命，是要把反革命分子全部清查出来，给以应得的处理，并不意味着我们把应当惩办的反革命分子都通统加以肉体上的消灭。帝国主义曾经在这个问题上毒恶地诬蔑我们，我国的资产阶级右派也大肆叫嚣。这只是证明了他们想吓唬我们，使我们不敢放手进行斗争，好把反革命分子保留下来，以便于他们的复辟活动。革命同反革命的斗争，是一场你死我活、不可调和的尖锐的阶级斗争。任何阶级斗争，总是不免要流血的。不仅无产阶级专政如此，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的专政更是如此。所不同的是，我们的专政，是革命镇压反革命，大多数人民镇压少数反动派；而剥削者的专政则相反。资产阶级和一切剥削阶级为了维持他们的专政，流了人民很多很多的血。列宁在“国家与革命”中说过：“很明显，为了达到剥削者少数始终压迫被剥削者多数的目的，就必然要采取极凶恶极残酷的镇压手段，就必然会造成无数流血惨案，而这样的流血事件是人类在奴隶制、农奴制和雇佣劳动制下都经历过的。”无产阶级专政要镇压反革命的反抗，当然也免不了要流些血。但是，这种流血的性质同过去一切剥削阶级专政下的流血，是完全不同的，这里流的血不是人民的血，而是反革命分子的血。光是就流血的数量来说，同过去一切剥削阶级的残暴专政，同蒋介石国民党的残暴专政比较起来，也是流得很少很少的。一切帝国主义和资产阶级右派的诬蔑，都是卑鄙无耻的造谣，正是由于我国革命同反革命的斗争进行得最坚决、最正确和最彻底，因此，我们在这场斗争中，流的血是最少的。
    遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，我们只是对于那些罪大恶极非杀不可的少数反革命，才采取了坚决处决的手段；对于大多数罪该惩办，甚至罪该处死、但还不是非杀不可的罪犯，都采取了劳动改造的手段。在我国的刑罚中，就有一条“判处死刑，缓期二年执行，强迫劳动，以观后效”的规定。帝国主义曾经污蔑这是最大的残忍，其实，我们说这是最大的人道。连罪犯都很了解，判处死刑缓期执行，这是人民政府刀下留人，给他们最后一次自新的机会。事实上，得到这种处理的罪犯，一般都保留下来了。试问，古今中外有过这样伟大的创举吗？在资本主义世界里，找得出这样人道的法律吗？我们对反革命和其他罪犯实行劳动改造的政策，不仅是为了彻底剥夺反革命进行破坏的条件，而更重要的是为了彻底消灭反革命和其他犯罪的阶级根源和思想根源，使反革命在刑满之后不再回到犯罪的老路上去。
    十年以来，经过劳动生产和思想教育，多数罪犯都得到了不同程度的改造，有一批罪犯已经确实改恶从善了。一批过去的土匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团骨干分子、反动会道门头子和其他犯罪分子，不仅他们的反动的思想得到了改造，而且许多人养成了劳动习惯；有些原来毫无生产知识的，现在已成了比较熟练的技术工人或工程师；原来是文盲的，现在已经能阅读普通书报杂志。这些几乎是不能令人相信的奇迹，但这是千真万确的事实。而且在我们的新社会里，这并不是什么个别的事实。
    河北省有一个罪犯王仑，过去是蒋匪国防部二厅特务。他在关押劳改期间，经过政治思想教育，认罪服法，积极劳动，逐渐地学会了建筑工程的技术，现在已经具有相当四级建筑工程师的技术水平，得到了人民政府的宽大处理。
    青岛市有一个罪犯李宗英，过去是香港英帝国主义者的警察。1951年在青岛因犯罪被捕，判处徒刑五年。经过政治教育和思想改造，他决心脱胎换骨，重新做人。在劳动改造中，学会了生产技术，几次改进了机器。人民政府给予宽大处理，提前两年释放。但是，李宗英对于这个给了他第二次生命的劳改机械工厂，发生了感情，主动提出留下就业。现在他已经是熟练的四级技工，每月工资五十七元，而且在1954年结了婚，1956年5月生了第一个小孩，开始了新的生活。
    我国广大人民群众对于党和政府的劳动改造罪犯的政策，是热烈拥护、积极支持的。反革命罪犯的家属，对于党和政府把他们家庭中的败子改造成为新人也是衷心感激的。成千成万封信件寄给毛主席和人民政府，诉说了难以形容的激动和欢喜。天津市民韩学敏是刑满释放人员张权的妻子，她来信说：“我亲眼看到人民政府对于罪犯不仅在生活上给予人道主义待遇，而且改造了他们的反动思想，把多少个无用的渣滓变成了有用的人。我丈夫张权释放后，我们再也不争吵了，今后要用实际行动来感谢党！前天我们全家照了一个相，想做一个开始走向光明和幸福的纪念，并准备送给别人，考虑了半天，没有合适的对象，最后认为送给我们的再生父母——中国共产党才对。现随信附上照片一张，请您代党收下吧！”
    人们可以看到，像王仑、李宗英和张权这样的人，作为反革命罪犯，他们是已经被消灭了。但是，作为新中国的自食其力的劳动者，他们不仅活着，而且活得很好。对于社会主义建设来说，这些人原来是起破坏作用的消极因素；现在，不仅不再是破坏的力量，而且经过改造已经成为参加新中国建设的一分子。化消极因素为积极因素，这就是我们肃清反革命的彻底性，这就是我国革命同反革命斗争的伟大的成功！
    十年以来，革命同反革命斗争的胜利，大大地促进了我国社会面貌的大变化。中国已经由国民党统治时代的反动、黑暗、混乱的国家，一变而成为世界上最先进、最光明、最安定的一个国家。无论农村和城市，都起了翻天覆地的变化。
    在这里我们不妨回忆一下旧中国农村的黑暗情况。那个时候，国民党的反动官吏和伪保甲长，一天到晚要粮要款，拉丁拉伕；土匪和恶霸横行霸道，杀人越货，奸淫抢劫。广大农民在饥寒交迫的死亡线上挣扎。他们用这样一首歌谣来诉说自己悲惨的处境：“打下的粮食是地主的，讨个老婆是保长的，养个儿子是老蒋的！”解放以后，这种悲惨的日子，已经一去不复返了。全国农村经过减租退押、清匪反霸、土地改革、镇压反革命、农业合作化和人民公社化等一系列的伟大改革运动，已经是光明灿烂、欣欣向荣的社会主义新农村，五亿农民，已经彻底翻身，再也不受任何剥削和压迫了。
    就拿河南省的叶县来说吧，在旧社会，这个地方是有名的“土匪世界”，抢劫杀人的事情，天天有，夜夜有。广大群众饱受“水旱蝗汤（国民党军阀汤恩伯）”之害，极端贫困，痛苦不堪。1942年大旱灾，全县饿死一万零九百多人，有一千六百多户全家饿死。“易子而食，析骸以爨”的惨景，屡见不鲜。真是人间地狱。今天的叶县，成了人间的天堂。不仅军阀早已打倒，盗匪亦已绝迹，1958年农业大丰收，地里场里粮食堆积成山，没有发生过一起盗窃案件。今年的大旱灾，比1942年那次还要严重，但是全县不仅没有饿死一个人，而且粮食得到增产。全县人民经过十年来的努力奋斗，特别是经过近两年来工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化，修建了中小型水库五十二个，每个公社都建设了几个工厂，全县共有钢铁厂、水泥厂、农具厂、棉织厂等三百多个。叶县人民，同全国人民一样，已经走上了安宁、幸福和繁荣的道路。从这个县的政治经济的发展变化，就可以看出我国农村已经发生了多么伟大而惊人的变革。
    解放后的城市，同农村一样，也起了翻天覆地的变化。
    人民的首都北京，在旧社会是历代封建王朝和帝国主义、军阀统治的中心，各种反革命势力麇集，旧社会渣滓成堆，把一个北京城弄得乌烟瘴气，肮脏不堪。解放以后，北京一变而为祖国的心脏。经过历次社会改革，全市面目一新，无论政治环境和自然环境都已经打扫得干干净净。大跃进以来，我们的首都已经建设得更加雄伟壮丽了，现代化的工厂林立，城内外遍地鲜花。就是那些过去最黑暗的角落，如今也是一片光明。著名的天桥，过去是藏垢纳污的地方，上有恶霸遮天，下有地痞横行，那里是骗子、小偷、流氓的天下，好人在那里饱受欺凌。多少良家妇女在那里受尽侮辱，沦为娼妓。解放以后，经过多次的社会改革和镇反运动，盘踞在天桥的“六虎”“四霸”，连同所有社会渣滓，一扫干净，红旗在天桥飘扬，人民群众已经彻底翻了身。
    我国的大城市上海，过去是以“冒险家的乐园”而著名于全世界的；现在，它已经不是什么“冒险家的乐园”，而是人民的乐园了。近几年来，上海不仅抢案消灭，就是盗窃案件也很少发生。上海有一个著名的游艺场“大世界”，过去是帝国主义暗探、国民党特务、流氓、恶棍、盗窃、骗子、娼妓活动的集中地，是著名的人间魔窟，犯罪渊薮，也是那些被侮辱与被迫害者的火坑。现在，“大世界”经过民主改革和反霸斗争，恶势力已经连根铲除。每天有几十种电影、戏剧、曲艺向人民演出，它已经成为劳动人民休息、娱乐和进行社会主义自我教育的幸福之家了。
    当然，这样的变化，决不仅是河南叶县和北京、上海等地如此。全国广大农村和城市都是这样。我国人民在自己祖国辽阔的大地上，户户安居，人人乐业，大家自由地呼吸，自由地劳动，自由地工作、学习和生活，再也不受帝国主义和反动阶级、反动分子的压迫和欺侮了！“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”，正是新中国真实的写照。全国人民在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，热气腾腾，干劲冲天，工农业生产大跃进，人民公社的太阳，普照四方，社会主义建设的热潮，奔腾万里。中国的今天，正如毛主席去年4月在“介绍一个合作社”一文中所说的：“共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展。广大群众的政治觉悟迅速提高。……从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变。至死不变、愿意带着花岗岩头脑去见上帝的人，肯定有的，那也无关大局。一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。”一年多以来我国形势的发展，进一步证明了毛主席上述马克思列宁主义的分析和论断，是绝对正确的。
    中国革命同反革命的斗争，所以能够取得伟大的胜利，主要的原因是：
    第一，我们的事业是正义的，正义的事业是一定能够胜利的。革命同反革命的斗争，代表了最广泛的最受压迫的人民群众的最大利益，代表了社会进步和生产力发展的需要，代表了最大的真理和最高的道义。人们可以看到，广大人民在控诉反革命罪行的时候，表现了那么大的怨愤和激动；在同反革命斗争的时候，表现了那么大的勇敢和积极性；在镇压反革命斗争取得胜利的时候，表现了那么大的欢欣鼓舞；革命同反革命斗争的成功，产生了那么大的积极效果。所有这些，都充分说明了，我们同反革命斗争的正义性，是完全顺乎天理，合乎人情的。因此，得到了全国人民的热烈拥护和支持，取得了伟大的胜利。反革命分子则恰恰相反，它们干的是罪恶的反动的勾当，与人民作对，危害人民，背叛祖国，妄图阻碍社会的前进。它们完全是非正义的，为天理人情所不容，所以，它们在人民当中完全孤立，社会基础日益缩小，是一定要失败的。
    第二，我国的革命同反革命的斗争，有共产党和毛主席的英明领导。在全国胜利以后，革命同反革命的斗争，依然是一场伟大的革命运动，没有共产党的领导，就不能成功。党和毛主席在领导革命同反革命的斗争中，规定了正确的方针政策。这就是我们政府一贯遵循的：“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”和“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针。这就是对待反革命分子的惩办与宽大相结合、劳动改造与思想教育相结合的政策。1959年9月17日，中华人民共和国主席颁布的特赦令，表现了党的这个政策的伟大胜利。也是这个政策在新的历史条件下的具体运用和发展。经过十年斗争实践的检验，完全证明了我们党的方针，是最正确的方针；我们党的政策，是最有效的政策；党和毛主席的领导，是最好的领导。在这样十分尖锐的斗争中，我们的党和毛主席的方针、政策和领导，始终像北极星一样明确，像狮子一样勇猛，像天平一样公正，像火焰一样热烈，像泰山一样镇静，表现了雄伟的革命气魄和最大的实事求是的精神。我们党和毛主席在革命同反革命的斗争中规定的方针和政策，以及对于实际斗争的领导艺术，充分地体现了马克思列宁主义和中国革命的具体实践相结合的强大生命力。党和毛主席的英明领导，是我国革命同反革命斗争取得伟大胜利的决定关键。
    第三，我国革命同反革命斗争的伟大胜利，是六亿五千万人民的胜利。我国革命同反革命斗争的根本路线，就是群众肃反的路线。革命同反革命的斗争是人民彻底解放自己的事业，是一场伟大的革命群众运动，要战胜并彻底肃清反革命，没有群众的依靠，不放手发动广大群众起来斗争，是不能成功的。我国的革命同反革命的斗争，在党和毛主席的领导下，始终坚持实行了群众路线，使群众斗争同专门机关的工作相结合。事实证明，群众肃反路线，是最正确的最革命的最彻底的也是最有保证的路线。正是因为实行了群众路线，我们的胜利伟大，偏差很小，时间不长，收效极快。我们的经验成功地说明了，实行了群众肃反的路线，反革命的威风迅速打倒，人民觉悟迅速提高。今后只要还有反革命存在，还有革命同反革命的斗争，我们就必须坚持群众路线。党的领导和群众路线，是胜利的红旗。我们一定要把这个光荣的旗帜高高举起来，一直到阶级斗争的完全消灭，革命同反革命斗争的完全胜利！
    现在，国内外的情况很好，我国革命同反革命斗争的形势，已经发生了根本变化。革命的力量正在一日千里地向前发展，残余反革命分子已经处在气息奄奄、朝不保夕的绝境。他们是一定会被彻底消灭的。但是，尽管如此，斗争并没有结束。国内还有阶级和阶级斗争，还有一些反社会主义的力量，国外还有帝国主义存在。敌人虽然大大地被削弱了，但是还没有被完全消灭。他们还不甘心就此罢手，正在继续加紧各种阴谋活动。最近，我们的人民公安机关连续捕获美帝国主义和蒋介石集团派遣进来的特务间谍，同时，也破获了一批国内残余反革命分子的现行破坏的案件。这些事实都告诉我们，我们决不可以骄傲轻敌，使自己麻痹起来，放松警惕，放松斗争。
    一切残余反革命分子实际上都是帝国主义的走狗，有一些反革命的破坏活动，并且有帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义在背后策动。美国总统艾森豪威尔，在1958年6月18日的记者招待会上，公开表示，美国要对社会主义阵营各国加强它的颠覆破坏活动。他说“美国现在要做的”，是在社会主义阵营“内部建立离心力量”，并且公开招认，“在这方面，美国已经做了许多工作”。1959年1月14日，艾森豪威尔在美国全国记者联谊会上，针对中国又说了这样的话：“如果中共继续其目前的路线，则美国确实须加以注意”。公然表示妄图“在中国大陆上造成一股波澜”。这样，艾森豪威尔就以一个国家首脑的身份，把对中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的颠覆破坏活动，提到了国家政策的水平。对于美国目前正在继续执行的这种危险的路线，中国人民“确实须加以注意”。
    中国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，在过去十年，既然胜利地进行了革命同反革命的斗争，相当彻底地肃清了反革命；那么，可以断言，一切反革命分子今后的命运，决不会比过去的十年好一些。在强大的有着高度革命警惕和丰富斗争经验的中国人民面前，帝国主义和反动派的任何破坏阴谋都是永远不能得逞的。
