    Create the Best Achievements to Dedicate to the National Day
    --Congratulations on the Opening of the First National Games
    The First National Games of the People’s Republic of China opens in Beijing today.
    The First National Games is one of the activities celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China. This conference will review the achievements of China's sports movement in the past ten years, further unite all sports workers, promote the development of China's sports movement, and improve sports technical level. We congratulate the First National Games on its brilliant victory with excitement and warmth; and extend our cordial greetings to all athletes and staff.
    This Games has extremely broad mass participation. Since the decision to hold the National Games last year, people and sports workers and athletes from all over the country have responded enthusiastically and actively participated in the selection competitions. About 50 million people across the country participated in the qualifying rounds. Each province, city, and autonomous region held one to several provincial, municipal, and autonomous region sports meets within a year, carefully selecting outstanding athletes to participate in the National Games. Among the more than 10,000 athletes from the 29 delegations participating in this National Games, about one-third are female athletes; members of 27 ethnic groups including Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Zhuang, Miao, Uyghur, Tu, Korean, Gaoshan, Yi, Dong, and Daur; workers, farmers, soldiers, government officials, students, medical workers, etc., many of whom are socialist construction activists, combat heroes, and "Three Goods" students. The oldest athlete is over sixty years old, and the youngest is nine years old. Some mothers and daughters, brothers and sisters were selected into the delegation at the same time. Seriously selecting athletes to participate in the Games on such a broad mass basis, including athletes from so many ethnic groups and from all walks of life such as workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants in one Games, fully demonstrates the basic characteristics of China's socialist sports movement. This is simply unimaginable in old China or in capitalist countries. Before liberation, seven "National Games" were held, the largest of which had only eight events and more than 2,000 participants. The total number of participants in the seven "National Games" added up to less than 10,000.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always attached importance to and actively led the sports movement. The Party Central Committee once pointed out: "Improving the health of the people and enhancing the people's physique is an important political task of the Party." It is stated in our country's constitution: "The state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party in 1958 also clearly pointed out that "promoting sports" is an integral part of the socialist cultural revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly called on: "Develop sports and enhance the people's physique," and young people should "have good health, study well, and work well." Comrade Mao Zedong and other Party and state leaders often participate in physical exercise, which gives a more powerful advocacy to China's sports movement and gives the broad masses of people more obvious and profound enlightenment and education, thereby encouraging them to participate in sports activities. Under the consistent support and concern of the Party and the government, under the firm implementation of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of developing mass sports to serve production and national defense, China's sports movement has presented a scene of vibrant prosperity. Especially since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, under the encouragement and promotion of the national people's Great Leap Forward, the people's communization, and the nationwide military movement, both the popularization of mass sports and the improvement of sports technical level have achieved leapfrog development. It has played a very beneficial and active role in ensuring and coordinating the completion of production, work, and study tasks.
    Currently, hundreds of millions of people across the country regularly participate in sports activities. In factories, in rural areas, in government offices, in schools, and in parks, people can be seen doing exercises, running, playing ball, and practicing martial arts everywhere. It is truly as people say: "The sun has not yet risen and the stars have faded, the clock is pointing to half past five, the whistle sounds in the streets and alleys, and the morning breeze spreads one, two, three." The development of mass sports is becoming more and more widespread, and participating in sports activities has become a new fashion in our society. With the widespread development of sports activities, the number of sports events has also greatly increased. Almost all of the internationally popular sports events have been promoted in our country. The inherent sports events of various ethnic groups in our country have also been sorted out, researched, and improved, retaining the essence and discarding the dross, and have been promoted more widely throughout the country. On the basis of the widespread development of mass sports activities, the technical level has also been rapidly improved. The sports records of old China have long been completely broken and greatly exceeded. In the past few years, 1,366 athletes have created and broken 2,805 national records; since 1956, 33 people have created and broken 26 world records in 16 events, and won one world championship. One thousand and forty-four athletes and a large number of graded athletes have emerged in track and field, ball games, shooting and other sports. A large number of labor and defense system passers have emerged in schools, factories, and government offices.
    In order to adapt to the development of mass sports activities, and in order to train more sports workers with specialized knowledge, the state pays great attention to the development of sports education and sports facilities. Before 1958, six sports colleges were established in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. In the year of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many provinces and cities established their own sports colleges or sports schools. Provinces and cities across the country have built more than 4,000 large and medium-sized stadiums, sports fields, playgrounds, gymnasiums, swimming pools, nautical sports fields, parachute towers, shooting ranges, etc. In the past few years, thousands of sports books and picture albums have been published, and several sports newspapers and periodicals have been published regularly, with a wide circulation. In the future, with the development of the socialist construction cause, with the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and cultural education, China's sports movement will inevitably develop rapidly and achieve more splendid achievements.
    Currently, the people of the whole country are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, holding high the red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, carrying out a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy, and dedicating actual actions of completing and overfulfilling production plans to the great National Day holiday with full confidence. All the athletes participating in the First National Games are also encouraged by the Party's call and the situation of continued leap forward of the people across the country, and are striving to use the best achievements to welcome the National Games and the tenth anniversary of the National Day. At the swearing-in meeting on August 30, famous athletes Mu Xiangxiong, Jiang Yumin, Chen Jingkai, and others expressed their determination to give full play to their soaring spirit, improve their achievements, and dedicate themselves to the National Day. Soon, Mu Xiangxiong broke the world record for the 100-meter breaststroke, and Jiang Yumin improved the women's 100-meter sprint to 11.6 seconds. However, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements. We must strengthen the leadership of the Party, implement political command, be brave and tenacious, calm and resourceful, overcome difficulties, not be arrogant in victory, not be discouraged in defeat, and create the best achievements. At the National Games, we must not only compete in tactics and techniques, but also compete in unity and friendship. We must carry forward the communist moral style, not only strive to create the best achievements ourselves, but also help others improve together. Under the care and leadership of the Party, and with the love and support of the people across the country, relying on the close unity and cooperation of all personnel, the First National Games will surely be a success, and it will be a very wonderful one. We wish all the athletes, coaches, referees, and staff participating in the First National Games to exert their energy, strive for the upstream, and create the best achievements to dedicate to the great tenth anniversary of the National Day!

    创造最优良的成绩向国庆献礼
    ——祝贺第一届全国运动会开幕
    中华人民共和国第一届运动会今天在北京开幕了。
    第一届全国运动会是庆祝新中国成立十周年的活动之一。这次大会，将检阅十年来我国体育运动的成就，将进一步团结全体体育工作者，促进我国体育运动的发展，提高运动技术水平。我们满怀兴奋热烈的心情，祝贺第一届全国运动会取得光辉胜利；并向全体运动员和工作人员致以亲切的慰问。
    这次运动会具有极广泛的群众性。自从去年决定举行全运会以来，全国各地人民和体育工作者、运动员热烈响应，积极参加选拔比赛。全国参加选拔赛的约有五千万人。各省、市、自治区都在一年内分别召开了一次至数次的全省、市、自治区的运动会，认真地选拔优秀选手参加全国运动会。在参加这次全运会的二十九个代表团的一万多名运动员中，有三分之一左右的女运动员；有汉、满、蒙、回、藏、僮、苗、维吾尔、土、朝鲜、高山、彝、侗、达斡尔等二十七个民族的成员；有工人、农民、部队官兵、机关干部、学生、医务工作者等，其中有许多是社会主义建设积极分子、战斗英雄和“三好”学生。运动员年龄最大的六十多岁，最小的九岁。有些母女、兄弟、姊妹同时被选入了代表团。在这样广泛的群众基础上认真地选拔运动员参加运动会，在一次运动会中包括了这样多的民族的以及工农兵学商各阶层的运动员，这充分显示了我国社会主义体育运动的基本特色。这在旧中国或在资本主义国家是根本不可想像的事。解放前也曾办过七届“全国运动会”，最大的一届也只有八个项目二千多人参加，七届“全运会”参加的人数加起来还不到一万人。
    中国共产党和人民政府对体育运动是一贯重视、积极领导的。党中央曾指出：“改善人民的健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务。”在我国宪法中载明：“国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展。”1958年党的八大二次会议又明确指出，“提倡体育”是社会主义文化革命的组成部分。毛泽东同志一再号召：“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，青年要做到“身体好，学习好，工作好”。毛泽东同志和其他党和国家的领导人经常参加体育锻炼，使我国体育运动得到更有力的倡导，使广大人民得到更明显、更深刻的启示和教育，从而踊跃参加体育活动。在党和政府的一贯支持和关怀下，在坚决执行党中央和毛泽东同志关于开展群众性体育运动为生产和国防服务的方针下，我国体育运动已经呈现出一片万紫千红、欣欣向荣的景象。特别是从1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国人民大跃进，人民公社化，全民皆兵运动的鼓舞和推动下，无论是群众体育的普及，或是运动技术水平的提高，都获得了飞跃的发展。对于保证和配合生产、工作、学习任务的完成，起了十分有益的积极作用。
    目前，全国已有成亿的人经常参加体育运动。在工厂、在农村、在机关、在学校、在公园里，到处都可以看到人们作操、跑步、打球、练武。真如人们所说：“朝阳未起星已残，时钟正指五点半，街头巷尾哨音响，晓风传遍一二三。”群众性体育运动的开展越来越广泛，参加体育活动已经成为我国社会的新风尚。随着体育运动的广泛开展，体育项目也大大增加。目前国际流行的体育项目，差不多在我国都已推行。我国各民族固有的体育项目，也已经加以整理、研究、提高，存菁去芜，在全国更广泛地推行。在广泛开展群众体育运动的基础上，技术水平也已迅速提高。旧中国的运动纪录早已全部刷新，而且大大超过。几年来，已有一千三百六十六个运动员创造和打破了二千八百零五次全国纪录；从1956年以来，已有三十三人在十六个项目中创造和打破了二十六次世界纪录，获得了一项世界冠军。在田径、球类、射击等项目中涌现了一千零四十四名运动健将和大批的等级运动员。各级劳卫制及格者在学校、工厂、机关大量涌现。
    为了适应群众性的体育运动的发展，为了培训更多的有专门知识的体育工作者，国家十分注意发展体育教育和体育设备。1958年以前，在北京、上海等地建立了六所体育学院，在全民大跃进的1958年，许多省、市都建立了自己的体育学院或体育学校。全国各省、市建筑了大、中型体育馆、体育场、运动场、健身房、游泳池、航海运动场、跳伞塔、射击场等约有四千多个。几年来还出版了几千种体育书籍和画册，并经常出版几种体育报刊，发行量很广泛。今后随着社会主义建设事业的发展，随着工业、农业和文化教育事业的大跃进，我国体育运动必然会一日千里地发展，出现更加绚烂的成绩。
    现在，全国人民正在热烈响应党的八届八中全会号召，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，满怀信心地用完成和超额完成生产计划的实际行动向伟大的国庆节日献礼。参加第一届全运会的全体运动员也在党的号召和全国人民继续跃进的形势下，鼓舞起十足的干劲，争取用最好的成就迎接全运会和国庆十周年。在8月30日的誓师大会上，著名运动员穆祥雄、姜玉民、陈镜开等都表示决心，要发挥冲天干劲，提高成绩，向国庆献礼。不久，穆祥雄就突破了一百米蛙泳世界纪录，姜玉民将女子一百米短跑提高到十一点六秒。但是，我们不要满足已有的成绩，一定要加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，勇敢顽强，沉着机智，克服困难，胜不骄，败不馁，创造出最优良的成绩。在全运会上，不仅要比战术，比技术，也要比团结、比友爱，要发扬共产主义的道德作风，不仅自己努力创造最优良的成绩，而且要帮助别人共同提高。在党的关怀和领导下，在全国人民的热爱和支持下，依靠全体人员的亲密团结，共同合作，第一届全运会一定可以开好，而且会开得十分精彩。我们预祝参加第一届全运会的全体运动员、教练员、裁判员和工作人员，鼓足干劲，力争上游，创造最优良的成绩向伟大的国庆十周年献礼！
