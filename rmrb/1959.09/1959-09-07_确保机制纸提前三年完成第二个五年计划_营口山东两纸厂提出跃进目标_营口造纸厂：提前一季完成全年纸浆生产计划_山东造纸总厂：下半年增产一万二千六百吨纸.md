Shenyang, September 6th – Workers at the Yingkou Paper Mill, which is responsible for supplying pulp to more than sixty paper mills across the country, have launched a vigorous new upsurge in increasing production and practicing economy, focusing on increasing pulp production. All the workers in the factory issued a bold statement: "Strive to complete the state plan of producing 72,000 tons of pulp per year three months ahead of schedule and to increase pulp production by another 28,000 tons for the country by the end of the year!" At present, the workers are taking effective measures in every possible way to produce more pulp and improve quality.

Insufficient raw material supply is the factory's main difficulty. In order to solve this problem, on the one hand, the factory director took the lead in organizing a group of cadres to go to Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Hunan to purchase and transport raw materials; on the other hand, they organized the factory's workers to strengthen raw material management, comprehensively control losses, reduce reed consumption and other technological processes, and vigorously save raw materials. All workshops, focusing on the ten quota breakthroughs proposed by the Party committee, researched and proposed key issues, organized workers to speak out freely, put forward suggestions, find measures, and carry out technological innovations to overcome production bottlenecks. From August 12th to 18th, the factory put forward a total of 2,230 improvement suggestions, of which 888 have been implemented, which has greatly improved output, improved quality, and reduced costs. In discussing how to solve the shortage of raw materials and use more substitutes, the workers in the reed-cutting section of the pulp workshop put forward 32 innovation suggestions in just one day, August 13th. The implemented part has increased the proportion of substitutes from 10% in the past to 30%. Li Guizhang, the director of this workshop, worked with the workers on the No. 1 pulping machine to study how to increase production. He adopted the workers' suggestion of not cutting the edges of the dryer cylinder paper, which can increase pulp production by about eight tons per day.

With the efforts of all the workers in the factory, the August production plan was overfulfilled twelve days ahead of schedule; the quality has also been greatly improved compared to the past. By August 19th, five of the factory's ten main technical and economic indicators had been broken through. Now, the workers are continuing their efforts and working tirelessly to strive for the early completion of the annual pulp production plan of 100,000 tons.

Jinan, September 6th – Inspired by the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Shandong Paper Mill, with the spirit of striving for the top, revised the production target for the second half of the year.

When the factory originally arranged the production increase and savings plan for the second half of the year, a few cadres believed that: "There are many difficulties, the production target can only be realistic if it is lowered, and the lower it is, the more realistic it will be." The production increase plan issued to the factory by the Shandong Provincial Department of Light Industry for the second half of the year was 11,700 tons, and a few cadres insisted that only 10,427 tons could be completed. The reasons were four major difficulties: (1) The supply of raw materials was in short supply, and there was no steel, rosin, or wood pulp; (2) Three small paper machines were transferred to support county and commune industries; (3) Major equipment repairs and trial production of new products, power outages, etc.; (4) The management structure was not sound. In response to this situation, the factory Party committee held an enlarged meeting; then, a representative meeting of workers was held, inside and outside the meeting, a free discussion and debate was conducted. And three specific accounts were calculated: (1) Shorten the beating time, increase the production of self-made pulp, and use wheat straw and other substitutes to solve the shortage of raw materials and reduce costs; (2) Increase the speed of copying and increase production; (3) Improve product quality. Through free discussion and debate, and calculating accounts and comparisons, all employees further realized that the Great Leap Forward is certain, it is inevitable to achieve a Great Leap Forward this year, difficulties are dead, people are alive, and can be completely overcome. Veteran workers like Liu Yuran said: "Our factory used to replace hemp and wood pulp with broken shoe soles and discarded fish nets, and there has been a great leap forward in recent years; we have experience, and we are not afraid of any difficulties."

On the basis of unifying thinking and clarifying understanding, a "study, compare, catch up" upsurge was immediately launched, and each work section put forward specific and vivid struggle goals, challenged each other, and set off a competition upsurge. After each work section identified key points, grasped measures, and formulated a production increase target of 12,000 tons for the second half of the year. At present, they are further mobilizing the masses and plan to increase production by another 675 tons on the basis of 12,000 tons, an increase of 975 tons over the 11,700 tons assigned by the higher authorities, and strive for 1,000 tons, and strive to fully and overfulfill this year's state plan half a month ahead of schedule.

    确保机制纸提前三年完成第二个五年计划
    营口山东两纸厂提出跃进目标
    营口造纸厂：提前一季完成全年纸浆生产计划
    山东造纸总厂：下半年增产一万二千六百吨纸
    本报沈阳6日电　担负供应全国六十多个纸厂用浆的营口造纸厂职工，掀起了一个以增产纸浆为中心的轰轰烈烈的增产节约新高潮。全厂职工发出：“为提前三个月完成年产七万二千吨纸浆的国家计划，到年底再为国家增产二万八千吨纸浆而奋斗”的豪语。目前，职工们正在千方百计地采取有效措施，为多产纸浆，提高质量而努力。
    原料供应不足，是这个厂的主要困难。为了解决这个问题，一方面由厂长挂帅，组织一批干部分赴黑龙江、吉林和湖南等地采购与运输原料；另方面组织厂内职工，从加强原料管理，全面控制流失和降低苇片消耗等工艺过程，大力节约原料。各车间都围绕党委提出的突破十项定额，研究提出了关键问题，组织工人大鸣大放，提建议，找措施，进行技术革新攻破生产关键。从8月12日到18日，全厂共提出改进意见二千二百三十件，现已实现了八百八十八件，对提高产量，改进质量，降低成本作用很大。在讨论如何解决原料不足，多用代用料时，制浆车间切苇工段的工人，仅在8月13日一天内，就提出三十二项革新建议，已实现的部分，使代用料的比例由过去的10％提高到30％。这个车间的车间主任李桂章，在一号抽浆机和工人一起研究如何提高产量时，采用了工人提出的不割烘缸纸边的意见，每天可增产纸浆八吨左右。
    在全厂职工的努力下，提前十二天，超额完成了8月份生产计划；质量比过去也有很大提高。全厂十项主要技术经济指标，到8月19日已突破了五项。现在，职工们正继续努力，为再争取提前完成年产十万吨纸浆计划而不懈努力。
    本报济南6日电　山东造纸总厂在八届八中全会的号召鼓舞下，用力争上游的精神，修订了下半年的产量指标。
    这个厂原来在安排下半年的增产节约计划时，有少数干部认为：“困难多，生产指标只有落才能实，越落越实”。下半年山东省轻工业厅下达给这个厂的增产计划是一万一千七百吨，少数干部坚持只能完成一万零四百二十七吨。理由是有四大困难：（一）原材料供不应求，没有钢材和松香，木浆；（二）调走三台小纸机支援县社工业；（三）设备大修试制新产品，停电等；（四）管理机构不健全；针对这个情况，厂党委召开了扩大会议；接着又召开了职工代表大会，会内会外，进行了鸣放辩论。并且具体算了三笔账；（一）缩短打浆时间，增产自制浆，利用麦草等代用品，解决原料不足，降低成本的账；（二）抄速提高，增加产量的账；（三）提高产品质量的账。通过鸣放辩论，算账对比，使全体职工进一步认清了大跃进是肯定的，今年实现大跃进是必然的，困难是死的，人是活的，是完全能够克服的。老工人刘玉然等说：“咱厂过去用破鞋底废鱼网代替麻料和木浆，几年来有了很大跃进；我们有了经验，什么困难也不怕”。
    在统一思想明确认识的基础上，紧接着掀起了“学、比、赶”的热潮，各工段都提出了具体生动的奋斗目标，互相挑应战，掀起了竞赛高潮。经过各工段排关键，抓措施，制定了下半年一万二千吨的增产指标。目前他们正在进一步发动群众，打算在一万二千吨的基础上，再增产六百七十五吨，比上级下达的指标一万一千七百吨增产九百七十五吨，争取一千吨，并力争提前半个月全面超额完成今年国家计划。　　　　（宋成富）（附图片）
