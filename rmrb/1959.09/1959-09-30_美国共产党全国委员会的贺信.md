To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing, China

Dear Comrades:

    The founding of the People's Republic of China is one of the most significant and epoch-making events in human history. The Communist Party of China—the brilliant crystallization of the great Chinese nation—with unparalleled heroism and wisdom, organized and led the people of all ethnic groups in decades of struggle, defeating foreign imperialists and feudal-capitalist reactionaries, and finally establishing the People's Republic of China ten years ago.

    In just ten years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong and its Marxist-Leninist Central Committee, China has leapt from a weak and backward country—a victim ravaged by feudal exploiters and insatiable foreign overlords—to a modern agricultural and industrial power, attaining the status of a major nation in the international family.

    Now, the great leap forward era of China's economic and cultural development is admired and encouraged by hundreds of millions of toiling workers and peasants still languishing under the shackles of feudalism and imperialism.

    The democratic and socialist government of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, organizes the liberated creative power of hundreds of millions of Chinese people, striving to enrich human life and to defend and consolidate world peace. Neither the feudal "nationalist" schemers in Tibet, nor the exploited adventurers based in Taiwan, serving as pawns for the futile schemes of Western imperialists, can for a moment obscure the glorious and splendid prospects that the great strides made by the Chinese people in the past decade have unveiled before all of humanity.

    In our country, the desire for peace and for the establishment of friendship, cultural exchange, and realistic relations between the governments and peoples of the East and the West has gained a new and significant awakening, which is being expressed with increasing force. Part of this awakening is the growing number of people in business, churches, and labor circles, and among important conservative political leaders, who advocate the establishment of normal diplomatic and trade relations with the new China, and its admission to the United Nations. At this important moment of Premier Khrushchev's visit to our country, this awakening is being expressed very vividly: people are expressing friendship, a desire for peace, a desire for reconciliation between the United States and the Soviet Union, and a desire for a summit conference attended by all major powers to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and to resolve all disputed issues through peaceful negotiations.

    The American people certainly and undoubtedly hope to abolish the bankrupt and suicidal Cold War policy associated with Dulles and Truman. Therefore, more and more Americans are advocating a change in our entire foreign policy, taking new initiatives to reconcile with the People's Republic of China, and strengthening relations with the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries.

    Our own interests and national honor demand the annulment of all provocative acts and imperialist policies of hostility towards China so shamelessly adopted by the formulators and executors of the policy of strength. It demands the withdrawal of the Seventh Fleet from Chinese territorial waters. It demands the abolition of American military bases in Taiwan and the coastal islands, and the end of the American occupation regime under Chiang Kai-shek on China's island territories. It demands the restoration of full, equal, diplomatic, commercial, and cultural relations between the United States government and the government of the People's Republic of China. It demands the replacement of the Chiang regime's representative in the United Nations by the representative of the People's Republic of China.

    Only through these steps to correct the great harm done to China by our government's policy, and to eliminate the damage caused to the American people as a result, can we lay the foundation for our people and the Chinese people to benefit from friendly, trade, and peaceful relations between our two great nations.

    We deeply regret that passport and visa restrictions prevent us, like many other progressive Americans, from directly participating in the grand celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

    At this historically significant moment, dear comrades, please accept our heartfelt congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and through you, to all the Chinese people. We cherish our bonds of international working-class solidarity and the permanent ties of our common ideology, as well as the sublime ideal of all mankind enjoying boundless happiness, joy, and brotherhood. We pledge to help our compatriots understand China and be friendlier to China so that our government will recognize China, grant China its rights in the United Nations, abandon China's territory of Taiwan, and take all steps to establish normal, peaceful commercial and cultural relations with the government of the great Chinese people.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the friendship and unity of the Chinese and American people!

    We wish the Chinese people wings to fly to even greater heights of industrial development, cultural advancement, prosperity, and socialism!

    Long live world peace!

                                  With fraternal greetings,
                            The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States
                              Eugene Dennis, National Secretary
                                            September 16, 1959

### 美国共产党全国委员会的贺信

专栏：

    美国共产党全国委员会的贺信中国北京中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    中华人民共和国的成立是人类历史上最重大的划时代的事件之一。中国共产党——伟大的中华民族的天才的结晶——以无比的英勇精神和智慧在几十年的战斗中组织和领导各族人民战胜了外国帝国主义者和封建——资本主义反动派，终于在十年前建立了中华人民共和国。
    在仅仅十年的时间内，在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党及其马克思列宁主义的中央委员会的英明领导下，中国就从一个衰弱落后的国家——备受封建剥削者和贪得无厌的外国霸主蹂躏的牺牲品一跃而为一个现代化的农业和工业国，在国际大家庭中取得了一个大国的地位。
    现在，中国的经济文化大发展的大跃进年代，受到了仍然处在封建主义和帝国主义剥削的桎梏下的亿万劳苦工农群众的赞叹，并且使他们得到鼓舞。
    中国共产党领导下的中华人民共和国的民主的、社会主义的政府。把中国亿万人民的解放了的全部创造力组织起来，为丰富人类的生活，为保卫和巩固世界和平而努力。无论是西藏的封建的“民族主义”阴谋家也好，还是为西方帝国主义者徒劳无益的阴谋充当傀儡的以台湾为根据地的受人利用的冒险家也好，一时一刻都遮盖不住伟大的中国人民十年来取得的长足进展在全人类面前揭开的光辉灿烂的前景。
    在我国，要求和平、要求在东方和西方的政府和人民之间建立友谊、文化交流和现实的关系的意愿有了新的意义重大的觉醒，这种觉醒正在愈来愈有力地表现出来。这种觉醒的一部分表现是，在企业、教会和劳工方面的人士中间和重要的保守的政界领袖中间有愈来愈多的人主张同新中国建立正常的外交和贸易关系，主张让它进入联合国。在赫鲁晓夫总理访问我国这个重要的时刻，这种觉醒正在非常生动地表现出来：人们纷纷表示友好，表示渴望和平，渴望美苏和好，渴望举行所有大国都参加的最高级会议来禁止原子弹和氢弹，并通过和平谈判解决所有的争执问题。
    美国人民肯定无疑地希望取消同杜勒斯和杜鲁门联系在一起的已经破产了的、自杀性的冷战政策。因此有愈来愈多的美国人主张改变我们的整个外交政策，采取新的主动来同中华人民共和国和解，并加强同苏联和其他所有社会主义国家的关系。
    我国的自身利益和民族荣誉要求取消实力地位政策的制订者和执行者如此无耻地采取的那一切针对中国的挑衅行为和帝国主义敌视中国的政策。它要求第七舰队撤离中国领海。它要求废除美国在台湾和沿海岛屿的军事基地，取消蒋介石在中国的岛屿领土上的美国占领政权。它要求恢复美国政府和中华人民共和国政府之间的充分和平等的外交、商业和文化关系。它要求在联合国中以中华人民共和国的代表代替蒋政权的代表。
    只有通过这些步骤来纠正我国政府的政策对中国所做下的大坏事，消除由此而对美国人民造成的损害，才能为我国人民和中国人民都能从我们两个伟大的国家之间的友好、贸易与和平关系中得到好处打下基础。
    我们深深地感到遗憾的是，护照和签证的限制使我们像其他许多进步的美国人一样，不能直接参加伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年的盛大的庆祝仪式。
    在这个有着重大历史意义的时刻，亲爱的同志们，请接受我们对中国共产党中央委员会、以及通过你们对全体中国人民的衷心的祝贺。我们珍视我们的国际工人阶级团结的纽带和共同的意识形态的永久连系以及全人类享受无限的幸福、愉快和兄弟情谊的崇高理想。我们保证帮助我们的同胞愈来愈了解中国和对中国愈来愈友好，以便使我国政府承认中国，使中国得到它在联合国内的权利，放弃中国的台湾领土，采取一切同伟大的中国人民的政府建立正常的、和平的商业和文化关系的步骤。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国和美国人民的友好和团结万岁！
    祝中国人民插翅飞向工业发展、文化发达、繁荣和社会主义的更高境界！
    世界和平万岁！
                                  谨致
                  兄弟的敬礼
                            美国共产党全国委员会
                              全国书记尤金·丹尼斯
                                            1959年9月16日
