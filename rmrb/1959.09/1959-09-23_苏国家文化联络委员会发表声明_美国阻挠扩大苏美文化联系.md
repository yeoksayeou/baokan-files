Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, September 20th: TASS reported that the Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Kharlamov, stated at a press conference on the 20th regarding the expansion of Soviet-American cultural ties that the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, recently emphasized in response to questions from US Senators about the possibility of expanding Soviet-American cultural and scientific ties that the Soviet government advocates the broadest possible exchanges in this area. However, the US State Department not only opposes expanding ties but also advocates some reduction in the current connections.

These words have caused consternation among certain individuals in Washington, and a State Department spokesman insisted that the US side advocates expanding cultural ties, while the Soviet side is unwilling. Some American newspapers echoed these remarks, attempting to mislead the public. To this end, the press group accompanying the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers was authorized to issue a statement from the Soviet National Cultural Liaison Committee to the press.

The statement said: "The statements made by the US State Department spokesman cannot but be surprising. It is well known that the Soviet government has in the past and continues to make the greatest efforts to develop Soviet-American cultural exchanges." The statement pointed out that recently, Soviet and American artistic groups and sports delegations have visited each other, exchanged exhibitions, exchanged students, and the two countries' Academies of Sciences have signed cooperation agreements, all of which have been warmly welcomed by public opinion in both countries. "Under these conditions, there is reason to expect that the American side would agree to new proposals aimed at further expanding cultural relations. However, this expectation has not yet been realized."

The statement then cited many irrefutable specific facts proving that the US State Department deliberately intends to reduce cultural ties between the Soviet Union and the United States.

The statement said: "Recently, the State Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations submitted to the State Department some more detailed new suggestions regarding expanding scientific cooperation, especially in medical fields and in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. Furthermore, it also submitted detailed suggestions to the State Department regarding the exchange of information."

The statement finally emphasized: "If the State Department is truly willing to expand cultural cooperation with the Soviet Union as its representatives say, then it has a good opportunity to prove that it has this desire: to do so, it only needs to accept the suggestions made to the United States and sign the US-Soviet cultural cooperation agreement."

    苏国家文化联络委员会发表声明
    美国阻挠扩大苏美文化联系
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社旧金山20日讯：苏联外交部新闻司司长哈尔拉莫夫20日在记者招待会上就扩大苏美文化联系问题发表声明指出，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫最近在回答美国参议员关于扩大苏美文化和科学联系的可能性问题时强调指出，苏联政府主张在这方面实行最广泛的交流，但是美国国务院不仅反对扩大联系，而且还主张把目前的联系作某些减少。
    这些话引起华盛顿某些人士的慌乱，国务院发言人硬说，美国方面主张扩大文化联系，而苏联方面不愿意。某些美国报纸帮腔鼓吹这些言论，企图迷惑公众。为此，苏联部长会议主席随行新闻组受权向报界发表苏联部长会议国家文化联络委员会的声明。
    声明说：“美国国务院发言人的谈话不能不使人感到惊讶。大家知道苏联政府过去和现在一直在作最大的努力，力求发展苏美文化交流”。声明指出，最近期间苏美两国文艺团体、体育代表团互相访问，交换举办展览会，交换留学生，两国科学院签订合作协定等措施受到两国舆论的热情欢迎。“在这些条件下，有理由期望美国方面会同意目的在于进一步扩大文化关系的新建议。但是，这一期望至今却尚未实现。”
    声明接着举出许多无法反驳的具体事实证明美国国务院有意缩小苏美两国的文化联系。
    声明说：“最近，国家对外文化委员会向国务院提出了关于扩大科学合作、特别是在医疗方面与和平利用原子能方面进行合作的一些更为周密的新建议。并且还向国务院提出了交换情报方面的周密建议。”
    声明最后强调说：“如果国务院真正愿意像他的代表所说那样扩大同苏联的文化合作，那末它有很好的机会证明自己有这种愿望：为此，只要接受向美国提出的建议和签署美苏文化合作协定就够了。”
