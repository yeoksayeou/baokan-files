Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 3rd: Since Bulgaria launched a vigorous economic leap forward movement at the end of last year, the broad masses of agricultural production cooperative members have been in high spirits and full of energy, and tremendous changes have taken place in the economic life of the countryside. The good news coming from the agricultural production front this year indicates that the task of doubling agricultural production put forward by the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government will likely be smoothly realized.

According to materials published here, despite unfavorable weather conditions in spring and early summer this year, a great harvest is expected for wheat, sunflowers, corn, vegetables, and tobacco. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry estimates that commercial vegetables will reach over 900,000 tons this year, an increase of nearly double compared to last year; wheat will also yield 169.8 kilograms per decare (each decare equals 1.5 mu), an increase of nearly 6 kilograms compared to last year. At the same time, as of July 1st this year, the number of cattle nationwide increased by 16% compared to the same period last year, pigs by 57%, and poultry by more than one and a half times. In the first half of this year, agricultural production cooperatives sold seven and a half times more poultry meat and 44 million liters more milk to the state than in the same period last year.

A sign of the tremendous change in Bulgaria's rural economy is the merger movement of agricultural production cooperatives carried out last winter and this spring. Before the realization of agricultural collectivization, Bulgaria's rural land was extremely fragmented. After liberation, the Bulgarian Communist Party resolutely implemented the policy of socialist transformation of agriculture, and by 1958, basically realized agricultural collectivization nationwide, forming 3,292 agricultural production cooperatives, with collectivized land accounting for 92.3% of the country's land area. From the end of 1958, Bulgaria's rural socialist cooperative system entered a new stage of development, launching a widespread movement to merge agricultural production cooperatives. This movement of merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives was successfully completed in just a few months. As of April 1st this year, agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had merged into 984 large agricultural production cooperatives, with each agricultural cooperative having more than 1,000 households and a land area increasing from the previous 5,000 to 10,000 decares to 40,000 to 45,000 decares.

The expanded agricultural production cooperatives have opened up broad possibilities for large-scale water conservancy construction, more rational arrangements for diversified rural economies, and better utilization of land, labor, and agricultural machinery, which has played a major role in the further growth of agricultural production.

In order to ensure the completion of the agricultural production leap forward targets, a mass water conservancy construction movement was launched in the vast rural areas of Bulgaria starting at the end of last year, and it has already achieved brilliant results. As of July 20th this year, the completed water conservancy projects nationwide can irrigate 1.7 million decares of land, of which small-scale water conservancy projects built by agricultural production cooperatives can irrigate 1.5 million decares of land. During this period, a total of 1,500 reservoirs and pumping stations were built, more than 10,000 kilometers of irrigation canals were constructed, and hundreds of other various water conservancy projects were completed. The scale and speed of this water conservancy construction were unimaginable during Bulgaria's bourgeois rule. The irrigated area expanded by Bulgaria in less than eight months is almost four times more than the irrigated area opened up during the sixty-five years of bourgeois rule. The irrigated area increased by Bulgaria in one day this year is more than the total irrigated area expanded in one year and four months before liberation.

Since the beginning of this year, Bulgaria has also made great achievements in expanding cultivated land and sown area. The task of reclaiming one million decares of wasteland in 1959, proposed by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party at its plenary session last October, was overfulfilled by 250,000 decares on June 1st this year. Subsequently, the Bulgarian people set themselves a fighting task: to raise the target for reclaiming wasteland this year to 2.5 million decares. As a result of land reclamation, the sown area of various crops has greatly increased this year: the sown area of industrial crops has increased by 10.7%, vegetables by 14.4%, corn by 5.3%, fruits by 44.7%, and grapes by 5.4%.

In the economic leap forward movement, agricultural mechanization has also developed rapidly. At present, there are 30,000 tractors in rural areas nationwide, an increase of 2,300 compared to last year; the number of combine harvesters has reached 6,500, an increase of 950 compared to last year; and the number of heavy-duty trucks has reached 8,000 (while before liberation, there was not even one heavy-duty truck in the countryside). In the first half of this year alone, the area of land cultivated by machinery increased by 46.4% compared to last year. At present, 95% of plowing, 89% of sowing, 46% of harvesting, and 98% of threshing in Bulgaria's rural areas have been mechanized.

The amount of fertilizer applied to crops this year has also increased significantly. The amount of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers purchased in rural areas nationwide has increased by 1.3 times compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per decare of land has reached 15 kilograms. In 1944, the average amount of chemical fertilizer applied per decare of land was only 50 grams. In addition, Bulgaria also applied millions of tons of farmyard manure for the first time ever to summer crops this year.

At present, the members of Bulgaria's agricultural production cooperatives are advancing victoriously, striving to achieve even greater achievements on the agricultural production front.

### 小社合并大社　大量兴修水利　扩大耕地面积  保加利亚农业生产今年将要翻一番

    小社合并大社　大量兴修水利　扩大耕地面积
    保加利亚农业生产今年将要翻一番
    新华社索非亚3日电　自从保加利亚在去年年底开展轰轰烈烈的经济跃进运动以来，广大的农业生产合作社社员斗志昂扬、干劲冲天，农村的经济生活发生了巨大的变化。今年从农业生产战线上传来的喜讯表明，保加利亚共产党和政府提出的把农业生产增加一倍的任务将可能顺利实现。
    根据此间公布的材料，尽管今年春天和夏初气候条件不好，然而无论是小麦、向日葵、玉蜀黍、蔬菜和烟草等都将得到很大丰收。据农林部估计，今年商品蔬菜将达九十万吨以上，比去年增加将近一倍；小麦也将每一狄卡尔（每一狄卡尔合一点五市亩）收一百六十九点八公斤，比去年增加近六公斤。和这同时，到今年7月1日为止，全国牛的头数比去年同期增加了16％，猪——57％，家禽——一倍半以上。今年上半年，农业生产合作社向国家交售的家禽肉类比去年同期多了七倍半；牛奶增加了四千四百万公升。
    保加利亚农村经济发生巨大变化的一个标志是，去冬今春开展的农业生产合作社的并社运动。在实现农业合作化以前，保加利亚农村的土地是极其分散的。解放以后，保加利亚共产党坚决实行了农业社会主义改造的方针，到1958年就基本上实现了全国农业合作化，全国组成了三千二百九十二个农业生产合作社，合作化的土地，占全国土地面积的92.3％。从1958年年底，保加利亚农村社会主义合作化制度进入了一个新的发展阶段，开展了一个广泛的合并农业生产合作社的运动。这一小社并大社的运动仅仅在几个月的期间就胜利完成了。到今年4月1日为止，全国农业生产合作社合并成为九百八十四个大型农业生产合作社，每个农业合作社拥有的农户在一千户以上，土地面积从以前的五千到一万狄卡尔增加到四万到四万五千狄卡尔。
    扩大了的农业生产合作社为大规模兴修水利、更合理地安排农村经济的多种经营、更好地利用土地、劳动力和农业机器开辟了广阔的可能性，这对农业生产的进一步增长起了重大的作用。
    为了保证完成农业生产跃进指标，从去年年底开始，保加利亚广大农村开展了一个群众性兴修水利的运动，并且已经取得了辉煌的成就。到今年7月20日为止，全国修建完成的水利工程就可以灌溉一百七十万狄卡尔的土地，其中，由农业生产合作社兴修的小型水利工程就可以灌溉一百五十万狄卡尔土地。在这期间，各地总共修建了一千五百座水库和抽水机站，修筑了一万多公里灌溉渠和几百个其他各种水利工程。这种兴修水利的规模和速度在保加利亚资产阶级统治时期是不可想像的。保加利亚在不到八个月的时间内所扩大的灌溉面积，就几乎比资产阶级统治六十五年所开辟的灌溉面积多四倍。今年保加利亚一天所增加的灌溉面积，就等于解放前一年零四个月所扩大的灌溉面积的总和还要多。
    今年以来，保加利亚在扩大耕地和播种面积方面也取得了巨大的成就。保共中央去年10月全会提出的在1959年开垦一百万狄卡尔荒地的任务，已经在今年6月1日超额二十五万狄卡尔完成。随后，保加利亚人民又为自己提出了一项战斗任务：把今年开垦荒地的指标提高到二百五十万狄卡尔。由于开荒的结果，今年各种作物的播种面积有了很大的增加：技术作物的播种面积增加了10.7％，蔬菜——14.4％，玉蜀黍——5.3％，水果——44.7％，葡萄——5.4％。
    在经济跃进运动中，农业机械化也得到了飞速的发展。目前，全国农村已有三万台拖拉机，比去年增加了二千三百台；收获联合机达到了六千五百台，比去年增加九百五十台；戴重汽车达到了八千辆（而在解放前，农村里连一辆载重汽车也没有）。仅在今年上半年，机械化耕作的土地面积就比去年增加了46.4％。目前，保加利亚农村有95％翻耕、89％播种、46％收获和98％的脱粒工作已经机械化。
    今年农作物施肥量也大大增加了。全国农村购买的氮肥和磷的数量比去年增加了一点三倍，每一狄卡尔土地的施肥量达到了十五公斤。而在1944年，每一狄卡尔土地施用化肥的数量平均才只有五十克。此外，保加利亚在今年的夏收作物中还破天荒第一次施用了几百万吨厩肥。
    目前，保加利亚的农业生产合作社社员们正在乘胜前进，为在农业生产战线上取得更大的成就而努力。
