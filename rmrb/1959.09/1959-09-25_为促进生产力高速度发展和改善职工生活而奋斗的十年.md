Ten Years of Striving to Promote High-Speed Development of Productivity and Improve Workers' Lives
Minister of Labor Ma Wenrui

The past ten years since the founding of the nation have been a decade of high-speed development of productivity in our country, and also a decade in which the material and cultural lives of the working masses have been greatly improved. With the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, our country's working class has grown unprecedentedly, the people's right to work has been fully realized, the working conditions of the broad masses of workers have been fundamentally improved, and wages and benefits have grown rapidly. All of this has further promoted the development of production and construction and the improvement of labor productivity.

	The Working Class Ranks Have Grown Unprecedentedly

Before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the national economy was declining, a large number of people were unemployed and unable to make a living, and even employed workers were often under the serious threat of cold, hunger, and unemployment.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the situation underwent fundamental changes. Production and construction developed at a high speed, and our country's working class also expanded rapidly. At the end of 1949, there were a total of 8 million workers in the country. During the three years of the economic recovery period (1950-1952), this increased by 7.8 million, reaching 15.8 million at the end of 1952. During the First Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957), the number of workers increased by 8.71 million, reaching 24.51 million at the end of 1957. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, a Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction occurred in our country, unprecedented in history. In that year, the number of workers nationwide increased by 20.81 million compared to the end of 1957. The number of workers in our country has increased more than fourfold in just nine years.

The expansion of the ranks of workers has, on the one hand, met the needs of production and construction for labor, and at the same time, it has also met the urgent desire of the broad masses of people to be employed. The citizens' right to work stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has thus been realized. As everyone knows, the unemployment phenomenon left over from the old society was very serious, with more than 4 million urban unemployed, equivalent to half the total number of employed workers in the country at the end of 1949. Obviously, solving this problem was by no means easy. However, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, after only a few years of effort, with the recovery and development of the economy, the unemployment phenomenon was completely eliminated. The Party and the government, with a proactive and responsible attitude, adopted a series of correct policies and measures to solve the unemployment problem. For workers in bureaucratic capitalist enterprises and staff in Kuomintang government agencies, the policy of "taking them all in" was adopted, giving them a way out for work and life, which avoided the increase of new unemployment. For the originally unemployed, according to the needs of production and construction and the specialties and aspirations of the unemployed, they were gradually introduced to employment; those who could not be employed temporarily were given vocational training, organized to produce for self-help, or subsidized to return to their hometowns for production, as well as given relief funds to help them create employment conditions and solve their living difficulties. In this way, about half of the unemployed were re-employed during the three years of the recovery of the national economy. After the start of the First Five-Year Plan, production and construction developed even more, employment opportunities increased, and the number of unemployed people decreased day by day. By 1956, the unemployment problem was basically solved. Then, after two more years of effort, especially due to the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of the national economy in 1958 and the realization of people's communes in the countryside, the remaining unemployed also successively took up various work positions in building the motherland. The unemployment phenomenon has since been completely eliminated. In a populous and economically backward country, the fact that the serious unemployment problem left over from the old society was so thoroughly and quickly solved once again proves that the socialist system has unlimited vitality and unparalleled superiority. Let us take a look at the United States, the most industrially developed country in today's capitalist world. Nixon and his ilk tout it as "paradise," but in the United States, the number of unemployed in 1958, according to the official greatly reduced statistics, was 4.68 million, and an even greater number of employed workers are often under the threat of unemployment and underemployment. It is evident that the "paradise" of the United States under the rule of monopoly capital is only a "paradise" for a very small number of capitalists.

Eliminating unemployment is only one aspect of realizing the right to work for all. Our country, with a population of 650 million, also has millions of newly grown youth each year who require employment. The state arranges work for these new laborers based on the needs of production and construction and their own situations and aspirations. What is particularly worth mentioning here is the employment of women. In old China, very few women were employed. They were not only subject to social oppression but also in a subordinate position in the family, and their fate was very tragic. After liberation, with the development of production and construction, a large number of women took up social work positions and made significant contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland. In particular, in 1958, due to the needs of the comprehensive leap forward of the national economy, more than 55 million urban and rural women were liberated from housework and participated in social labor. In order to facilitate the participation of the broad masses of women in social labor, public welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, and laundry groups sprang up like mushrooms in cities and villages that year. The liberation of women's labor force has not only added a large number of fresh troops to our country's labor front, but also enables them to be in a truly equal economic position with men. This is something worth highlighting in the history of women's liberation in our country.

Due to the expansion of the workforce, the urban employment rate has reached a level never seen before in Chinese history. According to a typical survey, in Tianjin, a relatively developed industrial city, an average of only one out of every seven and a half urban residents was employed before liberation; while in the second half of 1958, an average of one out of every three and a half urban residents was employed. With the increase in the number of employed people in workers' families, the number of people supported by each worker has also decreased. According to typical surveys in thirty cities including Beijing and Shanghai, the number of people supported by each industrial worker decreased from 3.3 in 1957 to 2.9 in 1958 (including the worker himself). This is also an important aspect of improving the lives of workers.

While the ranks of workers in our country have expanded, the cultural and technical level of the broad masses of workers has greatly improved, and technical strength has grown rapidly. Before liberation, very few children of the working people had the opportunity to go to school, and most of them were illiterate. After liberation, the Party and the government opened the door wide for working people and their children to learn culture and technology. Now, the proportion of students with worker-peasant backgrounds in colleges and secondary schools across the country has greatly increased compared with the early days of liberation, and factories and mines have also organized various spare-time schools for workers in large numbers. According to statistics, in 1949, only 276,000 workers nationwide participated in spare-time schools, while in 1958, this number increased to 7 million, an increase of 24 times in nine years. The growth rate of our country's technical strength is also extremely fast. In 1952, there were 164,000 engineering and technical personnel in our country, which increased to nearly 620,000 in 1958, an increase of about 2.8 times compared with 1952. In order to meet the needs of production and construction development, since liberation, our country's technical education has also developed rapidly. Over the past ten years, twelve departments including metallurgy, machinery, railways, transportation, construction, water conservancy and electric power, coal, petroleum, chemical industry, geology, textile, and light industry have trained and are training 8.44 million new technical workers, of which 5.6 million have already been trained. This number is 2.6 million more than the total number of industrial workers in our country in the early days of liberation. Most of these new technical workers are trained in production, and some are trained in technical schools. In the work of training technicians, we have implemented the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor." While strengthening the teaching of technical operation knowledge, we have also paid attention to the teaching of political, cultural, and technical theory courses, in order to train new workers for the country who have both political consciousness and culture, who can engage in both physical and mental labor. In this way, the work of training technicians can not only serve socialist construction well, but also conform to the long-term goal of gradually reducing and even eliminating the difference between physical and mental labor. In 1958, under the guidance of the Party's policy of running schools diligently and thriftily and combining work with study, technical schools in our country, while conducting teaching, produced products. Through the production of products, they realized the full or partial self-sufficiency of school funds. Therefore, technical schools are not only educational units but also production units, which can not only train technical personnel for the country but also create material wealth. This is a creation in our country's education, and its significance is undoubtedly very significant.

According to the socialist economic law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, in order to ensure the planned and rational use of labor in production and construction departments, and at the same time to protect the people's right to work and give full play to the specialties and work enthusiasm of workers, since liberation, our country has gradually established a unified management system for labor. The so-called unified management mainly means that according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production, the urban and rural labor force is arranged in a coordinated manner. The workers needed by each enterprise and institution should be recruited and trained in an organized manner according to the labor plan approved by the higher authorities. It is strictly forbidden to recruit personnel privately, poach employed workers, or dismiss workers without reason. Ten years of practice have proved that this is a good system, which has played and will continue to play a positive role in socialist construction and people's lives. From the comparison of their personal experiences before and after liberation, the people of our country sincerely support this system. However, imperialists, especially American imperialists, are clamoring that China is practicing "forced labor" and "has no freedom to choose a profession." Imperialist gentlemen, talk less about "freedom"! In your country, where there is often a large number of unemployed, what freedom of choice of profession can be talked about for the unemployed who cannot find a way to make a living and the employed workers who are often under the threat of unemployment? The working class and laboring people of our country have deeply realized that the so-called "freedom" under the capitalist system is just a synonym for exploitation, unemployment, hunger, and death for the laboring people. As for us, everyone is working for our firm and unwavering grand aspiration—building socialism and communism. All the labor we are doing now is for our own happiness, for the happiness of our country and our future generations. The interests of the country and our own interests are completely consistent. The real glorious and free labor is here with us. In our country, workers are not threatened by unemployment, and everyone's intelligence and talent can be fully utilized. This is something that capitalist countries cannot do at all.

	Workers' Wages and Benefits are Constantly Increasing

Under the long-term reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in old China, production was on the verge of collapse, and the broad masses of workers had been living in a state of semi-starvation. Especially in the later period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, due to inflation and soaring prices, the lives of workers and the broad masses of working people were even more precarious.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the People's Government were committed to stabilizing prices. Since 1950, except for slight increases and decreases in the prices of a few commodities, the prices of bulk commodities such as grain, cloth, and daily necessities have been stable. This has spared the broad masses of working people from the threat of rising prices.

With the restoration and development of production, the wage level of workers has also been continuously improved. During the period of national economic recovery, the average wage of workers nationwide increased by about 70%. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average wage of workers nationwide increased by another 42.8%. In 1958, the average wage of existing workers increased by 3% compared with 1957.

In addition to raising the wage level of workers, labor insurance and collective welfare undertakings for workers have also been greatly developed. Before liberation, the lives of general workers were not guaranteed when they encountered special difficulties such as birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability. In order to alleviate this personal difficulty for workers, the Party and the government stipulated from 1950 that a labor insurance system should be implemented in enterprises with more than 100 workers. In enterprises with fewer than 100 workers, workers also enjoy labor insurance benefits by referring to the spirit of the labor insurance regulations and signing collective agreements. Other workers working in state organs and cultural and educational institutions enjoy public medical care and living welfare subsidies. At the same time, collective welfare undertakings for workers, such as nurseries, sanatoriums, and rest homes, have also increased rapidly. State expenditures on labor insurance, public medical care, and other welfare undertakings and living hardship subsidies for workers amounted to 14.1 billion yuan from 1952 to 1958 alone. The state has also implemented a student aid system in public universities and some secondary schools. State expenditures on student aid amounted to 1.8 billion yuan from 1952 to 1958 alone.

In addition, the state's investment in building housing for workers amounted to 94.54 million square meters during the First Five-Year Plan period, and another 26.42 million square meters were built in 1958, greatly improving the living conditions of workers' families.

As mentioned above, due to the increase in the wage level of workers, the development of workers' welfare undertakings, and the increase in the number of employed members of workers' families, their lives have greatly improved compared with before liberation and in the early days of liberation. This can be proved by the increase in the consumption of several major commodities by urban residents across the country. If the average consumption of each urban resident in 1952 is taken as 100, then in 1958 it was: grain 140, edible vegetable oil 143, meat 155, fresh eggs 167, sugar 195, cotton cloth 116, knitwear 267, woolen fabric 245, and bicycles 181. These ironclad facts completely refute the slanders of reactionaries at home and abroad. They say that the lives of Chinese workers are "worse than before" and that our construction sacrifices the people's lives and welfare. Let them talk nonsense with their eyes closed. The Chinese working class is fully aware that what we have lost is only the unemployment and poverty imposed on us by reactionaries at home and abroad in the past, and what we have gained is today's well-fed life and a better life tomorrow.

When dealing with workers' wages and welfare issues, the Party and the government have always adhered to the principle of "gradually improving the lives of workers on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity" and "starting from a population of 600 million, taking overall consideration and making appropriate arrangements." In this way, the relationship between workers' individuals and the country, the relationship between consumption and accumulation, has been correctly resolved, and the current and long-term interests of workers and the correct combination of improving lives and developing production have promoted the development of production and improved the lives of workers. At the same time, the relationship between the living standards of workers and peasants has also been correctly resolved, thereby promoting the strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance.

While raising the wage level of workers and improving their living welfare, the Party and the state have also carried out tremendous work in reforming the wage system over the past ten years. During the period of national economic recovery, a wage system reform was carried out universally in different regions. During the First Five-Year Plan period, another wage system reform was carried out nationwide. Through these two reforms, our country has fundamentally changed the extremely unreasonable wage system in old China, established a socialist wage system of distribution according to work, thereby greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of workers and the enthusiasm for learning culture and technology, and promoting the rapid recovery and development of production.

Over the past ten years, we have implemented the principle of distribution according to work in the wage distribution of workers. In the future period of socialist construction, distribution according to work will still be the basic principle of our country's distribution system. According to the principle of distribution according to work, reasonable differences are maintained in the wage income of various types of personnel within the workers. The so-called reasonable means opposing both egalitarianism and large disparities, because both egalitarianism and large disparities are not conducive to mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of all workers and are not conducive to production. As for the forms of wages, such as the time wage system, the time bonus wage system, and the piece-rate wage system, their adoption is not fixed but is determined according to the characteristics of production and the wishes of the workers, so as to be conducive to developing production and strengthening unity within the workers.

Over the past ten years, our country's experience has also proved that in dealing with wage issues (distribution issues), it is necessary to combine putting politics in command with material incentives, to combine strengthening the ideological and political education of workers with the correct use of the law of distribution according to work, and to "walk on two legs." It is not right to only focus on the role of material incentives while ignoring ideological and political work; or to only focus on ideological and political work while ignoring the role of material incentives.

	Workers' Working Conditions Have Been Fundamentally Improved

In the factories and mines before liberation, capitalists only wanted workers to work, regardless of their lives or deaths. Not only were the working hours alarmingly long and the labor intensity extremely high, but even the most basic safety equipment was lacking, resulting in widespread occupational diseases and frequent casualties. Workers' lives and health were severely damaged.

Improving the working conditions of laborers and protecting the safety and health of laborers are the firm and unwavering policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. These policies have been solemnly stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Over the past ten years, the state and various industrial departments have successively formulated and promulgated many regulations on labor protection and have allocated large amounts of special funds for labor protection to improve the working conditions of workers.

Now, the machinery and electrical equipment in our country's factories and mines are generally equipped with safety devices. Measures such as eliminating, recycling, sealing, and improving production methods have been taken for smoke, dust, and toxic gases, greatly reducing their harm to the human body. The work of preventing silicosis has received particularly significant results in recent years. The state stipulates that the concentration of silicosis in each cubic meter of working space shall not exceed two milligrams. Now, most units with silicosis have reduced the concentration of silicosis to the national standard, and many units have reduced it to below two milligrams. In high-temperature workshops of factories and mines, accidents of workers suffering from heatstroke and fainting have been basically eliminated due to comprehensive measures such as ventilation and cooling and supplying workers with cool drinks. The working conditions in coal mines have also been fundamentally improved compared with before liberation. In state-owned coal mines, the degree of mechanization of coal mining and transportation has been greatly improved, changing the situation of mainly manual coal mining and manual transportation before liberation. (In the Kailuan Coal Mine, the largest coal mine opened by British imperialism in Tangshan, Hebei Province, each transportation worker had to run eighty li underground per shift). Before liberation, only 30% of coal mines across the country used mechanical ventilation, and each person could only get a maximum of one cubic meter of fresh air per minute. Now, all mine shafts of state-owned coal mines across the country have adopted mechanical ventilation, and each person can get more than four cubic meters of fresh air per minute. At the same time, underground lighting conditions have also been greatly improved. In terms of loading and unloading, before liberation, it was generally done by manual shoulders, carrying, back carrying, and lifting. After liberation, with the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, vehicularization, tooling, and mechanization have been gradually implemented, and many basic construction sites have also achieved construction mechanization or semi-mechanization, greatly reducing labor intensity. In state-owned and joint state-private enterprises, a system of eight hours of work per day and one day of rest per week is implemented. Workers engaged in harmful health work are also subject to a system of seven or six hours of work per day. The shortening of working hours ensures that workers have the time they deserve to rest and study culture. The special difficulties of female workers in production have also been cared for and resolved. Before liberation, unemployment often accompanied female workers' pregnancy and childbirth. Now, they can enjoy 56 days of paid maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of the labor insurance regulations. During the period of pregnancy of female workers, they are also given care such as not working night shifts and being transferred to lighter work. With the increase in the number of female workers and workers' children, nurseries and breastfeeding rooms in factories and mines have also developed rapidly. In 1958, the number of nurseries run by factories and mines in our country increased by more than eleven times compared with 1952, and the number of children cared for increased by more than sixteen times. These facts fully demonstrate the Party and the government's infinite concern for the safety and health of workers and completely refute the lies of imperialists who insist that Chinese workers are engaged in "slave labor."

The Party's policy of safe production is the most powerful weapon to guide and promote the continuous progress of our country's labor protection work. The development process of our country's labor protection work is also a process of widely and deeply implementing the policy of safe production and opposing the purely productive viewpoint or the one-sided safety viewpoint. Developing production is the fundamental interest of the working class and the entire people of our country. Only by rapidly developing production can we quickly change the backward appearance of "poverty and blankness" left over from the old era, and can we create a material basis for improving the material and cultural lives and working conditions of workers. However, the working masses are the masters of the country and the creators of material wealth, and their safety and health must be given high concern and care. The policy of safe production appropriately summarizes the consistency between caring for production and caring for people under the socialist system, and therefore it has become one of the basic management principles of our country's socialist enterprises. This is also an important sign that distinguishes our country from capitalist countries.

The achievements of our country's labor protection work over the past ten years are also inseparable from the implementation of the Party's mass line. The mass line is the main method of carrying out labor protection work. Only by earnestly following the mass line can we promptly discover unsafe factors in production, improve safety production equipment quickly, economically, and effectively, and effectively formulate and implement safe operating procedures and systems to achieve the goal of safe production. Relying on the masses to do a good job in safe production has been particularly evident in the effect shown in our country's annual safety production inspection campaigns. Through mass safety production inspections, not only has a huge role been played in improving working conditions, but also good results have been achieved in improving the understanding of cadres and workers about safety production.

	Strive for Higher Labor Productivity

Lenin pointed out: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and most crucial thing to ensure the victory of the new social system. Capitalism has created a labor productivity that did not exist under the serf system. Capitalism can be completely defeated, and it will definitely be completely defeated, because socialism can create a new and much higher labor productivity." The rapid increase in labor productivity in our country over the past ten years and the consolidation of the socialist economic front fully prove this irrefutable truth.

The labor productivity of our country's industrial sector, calculated based on all workers, increased by 42.7% during the period of national economic recovery, an average annual increase of 12.6%; during the First Five-Year Plan period, it increased by 61%, an average annual increase of 9.9%; in 1958, despite the fact that new workers were added in multiples, the labor productivity of all employees still increased by 8%, and the total industrial output value of that year increased by 66%. Comparing the labor productivity level in 1958 with 1949, in the nine years, the efficiency of coal miners increased by 2.4 times, the efficiency of iron smelting workers increased by more than 16 times, the efficiency of steelmaking workers increased by more than 7.6 times, the efficiency of cement manufacturing workers (1957 compared to 1949) increased by 4.3 times, and the efficiency of cotton spinning workers increased by 0.74 times.

The reason why our country's labor productivity can have such a rapid increase is that under the leadership of the Party and the government, our people have realized the socialist ownership of the means of production, adhered to putting politics in command and the mass line, improved the cultural and technical level of the people, continuously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, improved the material lives and working conditions of workers, implemented the principle of distribution according to work, and reasonably distributed and used labor. However, due to the weakness of our country's original economic foundation and the current level of production mechanization is still poor, the achieved labor productivity level is still relatively low, and there is endless potential hidden in labor productivity. Therefore, we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements, and we will continue to exert our efforts and strive for more and faster improvements in labor productivity.

The achievements made by workers in our country over the past ten years in realizing the high-speed development of production and improving living standards are very significant. Of course, there are still some weak links in our work, such as the fact that the quota system in labor organization is not yet sound, some systems in wages and benefits are not fully in line with reality, and some work in labor protection needs to be improved, and so on. These all need our continued efforts in the future to improve all aspects of our work. When we recall the glorious achievements of the past ten years and look forward to the bright and splendid future, we know more clearly that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the socialist system are the most reliable guarantees for a happy life, and the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction is the only correct line. Let us raise the glorious banner of the General Line even higher, follow the direction indicated by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, oppose rightism, encourage enthusiasm, contribute our strength to the labor work front, and bravely advance to continuously promote the high-speed development of social productivity and further improve the lives of workers!

    为促进生产力高速度发展和改善职工生活而奋斗的十年
    劳动部部长　马文瑞
    建国十年来是我国生产力高速度发展的十年，也是职工群众的物质生活和文化生活获得巨大改善的十年。随着国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，我国工人阶级的队伍空前壮大，人民的劳动权利充分实现，广大职工群众的劳动条件根本改善，工资、福利待遇迅速增长，这一切又更加促进了生产建设事业的发展和劳动生产率的提高。
            工人阶级队伍空前壮大
    解放前，在国民党反动统治下，国民经济雕敝，人民大批失业，无以为生，就是在业的一般职工，也经常受着冻馁和失业的严重威胁。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，情况起了根本的变化。生产建设事业高速度发展了，我国工人阶级的队伍也迅速扩大了。1949年年底，全国职工共八百万人。经济恢复时期（1950年—1952年）的三年增加了七百八十万人，1952年末达到一千五百八十万人。第一个五年计划期间
  （1953年—1957年），职工增加了八百七十一万人，1957年年末达到二千四百五十一万人。1958年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，工农业生产建设出现了我国史无前例的大跃进，这一年全国职工较1957年年末增加了二千零八十一万人。我国职工人数，在短短的九年中增加了四倍多。
    职工队伍的扩大，一方面满足了生产建设对劳动力的需要，同时也满足了广大人民要求就业的迫切愿望，中华人民共和国宪法规定的公民的劳动权利从而也得到了实现。大家知道，旧社会给我们遗留下来的失业现象是十分严重的，城市失业人员达到四百多万人，相当于1949年年末全国在职职工人数的一半。显然，要解决这个问题，决不是轻而易举的。但是，在党和政府的正确领导下，经过短短的几年功夫，随着经济的恢复和发展，失业现象就被彻底消灭了。党和政府以积极负责的态度，采取了一系列的正确的政策和措施，来解决失业问题。对于官僚资本主义企业的职工和国民党政权机关的工作人员采取了“包下来”的政策，给他们以工作和生活的出路，这就避免了新的失业现象的增加。对于原来失业的人员，根据生产建设的需要和失业人员的特长及志愿，陆续介绍他们就业；暂时还不能就业的，则给以转业训练，组织他们生产自救，或者资助回乡生产，以及发给救济金，帮助他们创造就业条件和解决生活困难。这样，在恢复国民经济的三年中，就约有一半失业人员重新获得了职业。第一个五年计划开始以后，生产建设有了更大的发展，就业机会增多，失业人员一天天地减少了，到1956年，失业问题就基本上得到解决。接着，又经过两年的努力，特别是由于1958年国民经济的全面大跃进，农村实现了人民公社化，剩下的一些失业人员也相继地走上了建设祖国的各种工作岗位，失业现象从此就被彻底地消灭了。在一个人口众多、经济落后的国家里，如此彻底而迅速地解决了旧社会遗留下来的严重失业问题，这一事实又一次证明了社会主义制度具有无限的生命力和无比的优越性。试看一下当今资本主义世界工业最发达的美国吧，尼克松之流把它吹嘘为“天堂”，但是在美国，1958年的失业人数，根据官方大大缩小了的统计数字，就有四百六十八万人，而为数更多的在业工人，也经常处于失业、半失业的威胁中，足见垄断资本统治下的美国的“天堂”，只不过是极少数资本家的“天堂”而已。
    消灭失业现象只是实现全民的劳动权的一个方面。拥有六亿五千万人口的我国，每年还有数百万新成长起来的青年要求就业，国家对这些新的劳动者都根据生产建设的需要和他们本人的情况及志愿安排了工作。这里特别值得提出的是广大妇女的就业问题。在旧中国，妇女就业的极少，她们既受着社会的压迫，在家庭中也处于从属的地位，命运是十分悲惨的。解放以后，随着生产建设事业的发展，大批妇女走上了社会工作岗位，在祖国的社会主义建设中作出了重大的贡献。特别是1958年，由于国民经济全面跃进的需要，城乡妇女从家务劳动中解放出来参加社会劳动的，达到五千五百多万人，为了便于广大妇女参加社会劳动，这一年城市和农村中的公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组、洗衣组等公共福利事业的兴办，有如雨后春笋。妇女劳动力的解放，不仅给我国劳动战线上增添了大批的生力军，同时可以使她们在经济上同男子处于真正平等的地位，这是我国妇女解放史上值得大书特书的事情。
    由于职工队伍的扩大，城市就业面达到中国历史上从来没有过的普遍程度。根据典型调查，工业比较发达的天津市，解放前平均七个半城市居民中只有一人在业；而在1958年下半年，城市居民中平均三个半人中就有一个人在业。随着职工家庭就业人数的增加，每个职工赡养的人口也减少了。根据北京、上海等三十个城市的典型调查，每个工业职工的赡养人口由1957年的三点三人减少到1958年的二点九人（包括职工本人在内）。这也是使得职工生活改善的一个重要方面。
    在我国职工队伍扩大的同时，广大职工群众的文化技术水平有了很大的提高，技术力量有了迅速的增长。解放以前，我国劳动人民的子弟绝少有机会进入学校学习，他们中大多数人是文盲。解放以后，党和政府为劳动人民及其子弟学习文化技术大开方便之门。现在全国高等和中等学校工农成分学生的比重比解放初期有了极大增加，厂矿企业也为职工大量地举办了各种业余学校。据统计，1949年全国参加业余学校学习的职工只有二十七万六千人，而1958年就增加到七百万人，九年中增加了二十四倍。我国技术力量的增长速度也是极快的。1952年我国工程技术人员有十六万四千人，1958年增加到近六十二万人，约比1952年增加二点八倍。为了适应生产建设发展的需要，解放以来，我国技工教育事业也有了迅速的发展。十年来，冶金、机械、铁道、交通、建筑、水利电力、煤炭、石油、化工、地质、纺织、轻工等十二个部门已经培养出和正在培养新技术工人八百四十四万，其中已经培训出来的为五百六十万人，这个数字比解放初期我国产业工人总数还多二百六十万人。这些新技术工人多数是在生产中培训的，一部分是在技工学校中培训的。在技工培训工作中，我们贯彻执行了党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，在加强技术操作知识教学的同时，也注意了政治、文化和技术理论等课程的教学，以便为国家培养出既有政治觉悟又有文化、既能从事体力劳动又能从事脑力劳动的新工人。这样，技工培训工作不但能够很好地为社会主义建设服务，而且还符合于逐步缩小以至消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的差别的远大目标。1958年，我国技工学校在党的勤俭办学、勤工俭学方针的指导下，边进行教学，边生产产品，通过生产产品实现了学校经费的全部自给或部分自给，因此，技工学校不仅是教育单位，同时也是生产单位，既能为国家培养技术人材，又能创造物质财富。这是我国教育事业上的创举，其意义无疑是十分重大的。
    根据国民经济有计划按比例发展的社会主义经济规律，为了保证生产建设部门有计划地、合理地使用劳动力，同时为了保障人民的劳动权利，充分发挥劳动者的专长和工作积极性，解放以后，我国逐步建立起劳动力统一管理的制度。所谓统一管理，主要就是根据工农业生产的需要，统筹安排城乡劳动力，各企业、事业单位所需要的职工，要根据上级批准的劳动计划进行有组织的招收和训练，严禁私自招收人员、挖用在职职工和无故辞退职工。十年来的实践证明，这是一个良好的制度，它对于社会主义建设和人民生活都起了并将继续发挥积极的作用。我国人民从解放以前和解放以后的亲身体验的对比中，衷心地拥护这一制度。但是，帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者，却叫嚷什么中国实行“强迫劳动”，“没有选择职业的自由”。帝国主义者先生们还是少谈一些“自由”吧！在你们国家经常存在着大量失业者的情况下，对于找不到糊口之计的失业人员和经常受着失业威胁的在职工人来说，还谈得上什么选择职业的自由？我国工人阶级和劳动人民已经深刻地认识到，资本主义制度下的所谓“自由”，对于劳动人民说来，只不过是被剥削、失业、饥饿和死亡的代名词。至于我们，每个人都在为自己的坚定不移的宏大志愿——建设社会主义和共产主义在工作，我们现在进行的一切劳动，都是为自己、为自己的国家和自己的子孙后代的幸福，国家利益和自己的利益是完全一致的，真正的光荣而自由的劳动是在我们这里。在我们国家里，劳动者没有失业的威胁，每个人的聪明才智能够最充分地发挥，这是资本主义国家根本办不到的。
            职工工资福利不断增长
    旧中国在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期的反动统治下，生产事业奄奄一息，广大职工群众一直过着半饥饿的生活。特别是国民党反动统治的后期，由于通货膨胀，物价狂升，职工群众和广大劳动人民的生活更是处于朝不保夕的境地。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，党和人民政府就致力于稳定物价的工作。从1950年以来，除了少数商品的价格略有升降外，粮食、布匹、日用品等大宗商品的价格一直是稳定的。这就使广大劳动人民免除了物价上涨的威胁。
    随着生产的恢复和发展，职工的工资水平也不断地有所提高。在国民经济恢复时期，全国职工的平均工资就提高了70％左右。第一个五年计划期间，全国职工的平均工资又提高了42.8％。1958年，原有职工的平均工资又比1957年提高了3％。
    除了提高职工工资水平而外，职工劳动保险、集体福利事业也大量地举办起来了。解放以前，一般职工遇到生、老、病、死、伤、残等特殊困难的时候，生活是毫无保障的。为了减轻职工这种切身的困难，从1950年起，党和政府就规定在有职工一百人以上的企业中，实行劳动保险制度。在一百人以下的企业中，也参照劳动保险条例的精神，通过签订集体协议的办法，使职工享受到劳动保险待遇。其他在国家机关和文化教育等事业单位工作的职工，则享受了公费医疗和生活福利补助的待遇。与此同时，职工的集体福利事业如托儿所、疗养院、休养所等，也迅速增加了。国家开支的职工劳动保险、公费医疗及其他福利事业和生活困难补助等经费，仅1952年到1958年就达到一百四十一亿元。国家还在公立高等学校和部分中等学校中实行了助学金制度。国家开支的助学金，仅1952年到1958年国家开支助学金就有十八亿元。
    此外，国家投资为职工兴建的住宅，在第一个五年计划期间共有九千四百五十四万平方米，1958年又兴建了二千六百四十二万平方米，大大地改善了职工家庭的居住条件。
    如上所述，由于职工工资水平的提高、职工福利事业的发展和职工家庭成员就业人数的增加，他们的生活比之解放以前和解放初期有了很大的改善。这从全国城市居民对几种主要商品消费量的增长情况可以得到证明，如以1952年每一城市居民的平均消费量为一百，则1958年为：粮食一百四十，食用植物油一百四十三，肉类一百五十五，鲜蛋一百六十七，食糖一百九十五，棉布一百一十六，针织品二百六十七，呢绒二百四十五，自行车一百八十一。这种铁一般的事实，彻底地驳倒了国内外反动派的诬蔑。他们说什么中国工人的生活“今不如昔”，说我们的建设牺牲了人民的生活福利。让他们闭着眼睛胡说八道吧，中国工人阶级完全清楚，我们失掉的只是过去国内外反动派强加于我们的失业和贫困，得到的却是今天的丰衣足食的生活和明天的更美好的生活。
    党和政府在处理职工工资福利问题的时候，一贯地坚持“在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步地改善职工的生活”和“从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针。这样就正确地解决了职工个人和国家的关系、消费和积累的关系，把职工的目前利益和长远利益、改善生活和发展生产正确地结合起来，从而推动了生产的发展，也改善了职工的生活。同时，也就正确地解决了工人和农民生活水平的关系，从而促进了工农联盟的加强。
    在提高职工工资水平、增进职工生活福利的同时，党和国家十年来在改革工资制度方面也进行了巨大的工作。在国民经济恢复时期，分地区地普遍地进行了一次工资制度的改革。第一个五年计划期间，又在全国范围内进行了一次工资制度的改革。经过这两次改革，我国已经从根本上改变了旧中国极不合理的工资制度，建立起社会主义按劳分配的工资制度，因而大大地鼓舞了职工的劳动热情和学习文化技术的积极性，促进了生产的迅速恢复与发展。
    十年来，我们在职工的工资分配上贯彻执行了按劳分配的原则，在今后的社会主义建设时期，按劳分配仍将是我国分配制度的基本原则。根据按劳分配原则，在职工内部各类人员的工资收入上保持着合理的差别。所谓合理，就是既反对平均主义，又反对高低悬殊，因为平均主义和高低悬殊都是不利于调动全体职工的劳动积极性，不利于生产的。至于工资的形式，诸如计时工资制、计时奖励工资制、计件工资制等的采用，不是固定不变的，而是根据生产的特点和职工群众的自愿来定，使之有利于发展生产和加强职工内部团结。
    十年来，我国的经验还证明了，在处理工资问题（分配问题）的时候，必须把政治挂帅与物质鼓励结合起来，必须把加强职工的思想政治教育工作和正确地运用按劳分配的规律结合起来，必须“两条腿走路”。只注重物质鼓励作用而忽视思想政治工作；或者只注重思想政治工作而忽视物质鼓励作用，都是不对的。
          职工劳动条件根本改善
    在解放以前的厂矿企业里，资本家只要工人干活，不管工人死活，不仅工作时间惊人的长，劳动强度十分大，而且连起码的安全设备也没有，以致职业病丛生，伤亡事故频繁，工人的生命和健康受到严重的摧残。
    改善劳动者的劳动条件，保护劳动者的安全和健康，是中国共产党和人民政府坚定不移的政策，这一政策已经在中华人民共和国宪法中作了庄严的规定。十年来，国家和各产业部门陆续制定和公布实行了许多有关劳动保护的规章制度，并且拨付了大量的劳动保护专款，用以改善职工的劳动条件。
    现在，我国厂矿企业的机器设备和电气设备一般都设有安全装置。对于烟雾、粉尘和有毒气体，采取了排除、回收、密闭和改进生产方法等措施，大大地减轻了它们对于人体的侵害。防止矽尘危害工作。近年来收到了特别显著的效果。国家规定工作场所每一立方米的空间，矽尘的浓度不得超过二毫克。现在大多数有矽尘的单位都已经把矽尘的浓度降低到国家规定的标准，有许多单位并且降低到二毫克以下。厂矿企业的高温车间由于采取了通风降温和供应工人清凉饮料等综合性的措施，基本上消除了工人中暑晕倒的事故。煤矿的劳动条件比解放前也有了根本的改善。在国营煤矿中，采煤和运煤的机械化程度已经有很大的提高，改变了解放前主要用手工采煤和人力运输的情况。（当年英帝国主义在我国河北省唐山开设的规模最大的开滦煤矿，每个运输工人每班要在井下跑八十里路）。解放前全国煤矿采用机械通风的矿井只有30％，而且，每人每分钟最多只能得到一立方米的新鲜空气。现在全国国营煤矿的矿井已经全部采用机械通风，每人每分钟能够得到四立方米以上的新鲜空气。同时，井下照明条件也有了很大的改善。在装卸搬运方面，解放前一般是靠人力肩、扛、背、抬，解放后随着技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，逐步地实行了车子化、工具化和机械化，很多基本建设工地也实现了施工机械化或半机械化，劳动强度大大地减轻了。在国营、公私合营企业中，实行每日工作八小时、每星期休息一天的制度。对于从事有害健康工作的工人，还实行了每日工作七小时或六小时的制度。工作时间的缩短，使职工休息和学习文化的时间得到了应有的保障。女工在生产中的特殊困难，也得到了关怀和解决。解放以前伴随女工怀孕、生育而来的常常是失业。现在她们则可以根据劳动保险条例的规定，享受到五十六天照付工资的产假。在女工怀孕期间，还给她们以不上夜班和调做轻便工作等照顾。随着女工和职工子女的增多，厂矿企业的托儿所、哺乳室也迅速发展起来了。1958年我国厂矿企业举办的托儿所比1952年增加了十一倍多，受托儿童增加了十六倍多。这些事实充分地说明了党和政府对于职工安全和健康的无限关怀，完全驳倒了帝国主义者硬说中国工人从事“奴隶劳动”的谎言。
    党的安全生产方针，是引导和推动我国劳动保护工作不断前进的最有力的武器。我国劳动保护工作的发展过程，也就是广泛而深入地贯彻执行安全生产方针、反对单纯生产观点或片面安全观点的过程。发展生产是我国工人阶级和全体人民的根本利益，只有迅速地发展生产，才能够较快地改变旧时代遗留下来的“一穷二白”的落后面貌，才能够为改善职工的物质文化生活和劳动条件创造物质基础。但工人群众是国家的主人和物质财富的创造者，对于他们的安全和健康必须给以高度的关心和爱护。安全生产方针恰当地概括了社会主义制度下关心生产和关心人的一致性，因而它成为我国社会主义企业的基本管理原则之一，这也是我国区别于资本主义国家的一个重要标志。
    十年来我国劳动保护工作的成就，也是和贯彻执行党的群众路线分不开的。群众路线是开展劳动保护工作的主要方法。只有认真地走群众路线，才便于及时地发现生产中的不安全因素，多快好省地改善安全生产设备，有效地制订和贯彻执行安全操作规程制度，达到安全生产的目的。依靠群众搞好安全生产，在我国历年来的安全生产大检查运动中所表现的效果尤为显著。通过群众性的安全生产大检查，不但在改善劳动条件方面发挥了巨大的作用，同时在提高干部和工人群众对安全生产的认识方面，也收到了良好的效果。
            为更高的劳动生产率而努力
    列宁指出：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的东西。资本主义造成了在农奴制度下所没有过的劳动生产率。资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被彻底战胜，因为社会主义能造成新的高得多的劳动生产率。”十年来我国的劳动生产率的迅速提高和社会主义经济阵地的巩固，充分地证明了这个颠扑不破的真理。
    我国工业部门以全体工人计算的劳动生产率，在国民经济恢复时期增长了42.7％，平均每年增长12.6％；在第一个五年计划期间，增长了61％，平均每年增长9.9％；在1958年，尽管在成倍地增加新工人的条件下，全员的劳动生产率仍然增长了8％，这年的工业总产值增长了66％。以1958年的劳动生产率水平和1949年比较，在九年当中，采煤工人的效率提高二点四倍，炼铁工人的效率提高十六倍多，炼钢工人的效率提高七点六倍多，水泥制造工人的效率（1957年比1949年）提高四点三倍，棉纺工人的效率提高零点七四倍。
    我国劳动生产率所以能有这样迅速的增长，是由于我国人民在党和政府的领导下实现了生产资料的社会主义所有制，坚持政治挂帅和群众路线，提高人民的文化技术水平，不断开展技术革新和技术革命运动，改善劳动者的物质生活和劳动条件，贯彻执行按劳分配原则，合理地分配和使用劳动力的结果。但是，由于我国原来的经济基础薄弱和目前生产机械化的程度尚差，已经达到的劳动生产率水平还是比较低的，在劳动生产率方面还蕴藏着无穷无尽的潜力。因此，我们决不满足于已有的成就，我们还要继续鼓足干劲，为争取劳动生产率的更多更快的提高而努力。
    我国职工十年来在实现生产的高速度发展和改善生活方面所取得的成绩是十分巨大的。当然，在我们的工作中也还存在某些薄弱环节，例如在劳动组织方面定员定额制度尚不健全，工资福利方面某些制度不尽切合实际，劳动保护方面有些工作尚须改进，等等。这些都需要我们在今后继续努力，使各项工作更提高一步。当我们回忆已往十年的辉煌成就，瞻望未来光明灿烂的前景的时候，我们更加清楚地知道：中国共产党和毛主席的领导与社会主义制度就是幸福生活的最可靠的保证，党的社会主义建设总路线是唯一正确的路线。让我们更高地举起总路线的光辉旗帜，遵循着党的八届八中全会所指示的方向，反右倾，鼓干劲，在劳动工作战线上贡献出自己的力量，为不断地促进社会生产力的高速度发展和进一步改善职工生活而奋勇前进！
