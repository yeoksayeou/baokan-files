Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Dispatch: The famous industrial labor model and old hero Meng Tai recently came to Baogang from Anshan Iron and Steel, preparing to help the No. 1 blast furnace, which is about to be put into production, begin smelting iron.

The sixty-two-year-old hero, upon arriving at Baogang, climbed to the top of the No. 1 blast furnace, more than seventy meters high, to join the workers of the Metal Structure Company's Second Team in adjusting the large and small charging bells and the material distributor. After seeing that the gap between the large bell and the furnace mouth had been greatly reduced, he went straight to the piping construction site. The old hero is an experienced pipe fitter. Along the way, he touched and looked at the dense, spider-web-like network of pipes, large and small, to see if there were any problems. Seeing that the water flow in some cooling water pipes was uneven, he immediately reminded the workers to conduct another inspection. He said to Han Yuzhi, who came with him, "Look how big and advanced the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace is! We must work even harder to ensure that the furnace starts smoothly. Baogang, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Anshan Iron and Steel are all one steel, and it will be our honor to see the Baogang No. 1 blast furnace started well."

Old Meng Tai is now the Deputy Director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant. When he came from Anshan Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 blast furnace was about to undergo a medium repair, and the No. 8 blast furnace was about to undergo a major repair. Anshan Iron and Steel needed him very much. However, he still obtained the approval of the leadership and led Anshan Iron and Steel's most capable electrical technician Su Guiqin and gas technician Hu Fulin to support Baogang. He proposed to the leaders of Baogang that he would move to the site to live and start the furnace with the workers. He would not leave the front line until the No. 1 blast furnace was successfully started.

    老孟泰到包钢助战
    据新华社包头电著名工业劳动模范、老英雄孟泰最近从鞍钢来到了包钢，准备帮助这里即将投入生产的一号高炉开炉出铁。
    六十二岁的老英雄一到包钢之后，就爬到七十多米高的一号高炉炉顶上，同金属结构公司二队的工人一道参加了调整大、小料钟和布料器的战斗。他看到大钟和炉口的密闭间隙误差已大大缩小之后，又径直往配管工地走去。老英雄是老配管工。一路上，只见他对那些密如蛛网的、大大小小的管道，这里摸摸，那里瞧瞧，看它们有没有什么毛病。他看到有些冷却水管的水头流得不均匀，立刻提醒工人再进行一次检查。他向跟他一起来的韩玉芝说：“你看包钢一号高炉多大，设备多先进啊！我们一定要拿出更大的干劲，把炉点得顺顺当当的。包钢、武钢、鞍钢是一个钢，包钢一号高炉点好也有我们的光荣。”
    老孟泰现在是鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长。他从鞍钢来的时候，正赶上鞍钢十号高炉要中修，八号高炉要大修，鞍钢是多么需要他啊。可是他还是征得领导上的同意，并且带领着鞍钢最得力的电钳技师苏贵勤、瓦斯技师胡福林，支援包钢来了。他向包钢的领导同志提出：要搬到现场上住，同工人一起开炉，一号高炉点不好，就不下火线。
