The Tireless Peace Efforts of the Soviet Union

    Soviet Premier Khrushchev arrived in the United States on the 15th for an official visit. Shortly thereafter, later this autumn, U.S. President Eisenhower will also visit the Soviet Union. The mutual visits of the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States are an important measure that will help improve Soviet-American relations and ease international tensions, and a great victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

    The socialist Soviet Union, which has consistently advocated peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems, has made great efforts to improve Soviet-American relations. People of all countries in the world are also very concerned about the development of Soviet-American relations. This is because the Soviet Union and the United States are the two most powerful countries in the world, and whether they can coexist peacefully will play a decisive role in the development of the international situation. However, since the end of World War II, due to the United States launching the "Cold War" and openly pursuing an anti-Soviet policy, the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States have been in an abnormal state. The Soviet Union has more than once expressed its sincere desire to normalize relations between the two countries, and has used various practical actions to prove this desire. The Soviet Union once proposed to sign a fifty-year treaty of non-aggression with the United States, extensively develop trade between the two countries and encourage cultural ties, and so on. However, every Soviet proposal was met with either open opposition or unreasonable refusal. The Soviet proposal to convene a summit conference of great powers, put forward since January 1958, has been repeatedly delayed and rejected by the United States after more than a year of continuous promotion. While exposing this obstructive behavior of the United States, the Soviet Union insisted on implementing a peaceful foreign policy and continued to strive to promote the improvement of Soviet-American relations. In the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Comrade Khrushchev's report and concluding remarks, and the resolutions of the congress, all reiterated the demand for improving Soviet-American relations. All this shows that the promotion of mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States is first of all the result of the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a peaceful foreign policy and its continuous efforts to improve Soviet-American relations, and that the United States finally agreed to the mutual visits between the heads of government of the two countries because the situation was stronger than people, and it was forced to do so.

    Situation Forces People

    What situation forced the U.S. government to agree to make this decision?

    First, it is obvious that in recent years, the tireless efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to demand peaceful coexistence, to resolve international disputes through peaceful consultation, to end the "Cold War" and to ease international tensions have touched the hearts of the people all over the world (including the American people) more and more deeply. The proposal and implementation of the Soviet Union's great seven-year plan has further shown to the people of the world that the Soviet Union is striving for a long-term international peaceful environment to accelerate the construction of communism, and is going to carry out peaceful competition with the United States. On the other hand, the United States' insistence on the "Cold War" policy, the "position of strength" policy and the rigid attitude of refusing to negotiate peacefully with the Soviet Union, have increasingly lost popular support and have been opposed by the people of the world, and even by the American people and some of its allies. The demand for convening a summit conference of great powers and for improving East-West relations has become an irresistible and powerful mainstream in the development of the current international situation, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to continue to be stubborn. Under the strong pressure of the people of the world, the decision-makers of the U.S. government have to accept some easing practices, and the United States' agreement to this mutual visit is an attempt at such easing practices.

    Second, as everyone knows, in recent years, the world situation has changed greatly, the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the change in the balance of world power has become more and more favorable to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and unfavorable to the imperialist camp headed by the United States. Because the socialist camp is incomparably strong, subversion cannot subvert it, and it cannot be touched by hard bumps, which is proved by the failure of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident instigated by the United States and the setback of the United States' provocations in the Taiwan Strait area. After the Soviet Union's intercontinental missiles, three artificial earth satellites, space rockets and lunar rockets were launched one after another, even the United States could not help but admit that the Soviet Union had left the United States behind in both military and advanced science and technology. In this way, the old foundation of the United States' "Cold War" policy and "position of strength" policy has completely collapsed, and the United States' wishful thinking of forcing the Soviet Union to submit by relying on its superior strength has proved to be completely unworkable. Faced with this new situation, more realistic people in the U.S. ruling group, such as Kennan (former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union), Lippmann (a famous columnist), Warburg (an American banker) and Eaton (an American entrepreneur), have recently argued that the "Cold War" policy has come to a dead end. The call for direct Soviet-American negotiations or a summit conference of great powers has also become higher and higher in the United States. Even Dulles, who has always been a vanguard of anti-Sovietism, could not help but admit before his death: "There is no way to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming an economically and militarily increasingly powerful country," and expressed his willingness to sit down with the Soviet Union to discuss the German question. In his television speech on March 16 this year, Eisenhower was also forced to state when talking about Soviet-American relations: "Our final choice remains negotiation"; on April 18, U.S. Vice President Nixon also admitted: There is no other way out but to try to negotiate. It is in this situation that cultural exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union and mutual visits between political figures of the two countries have gradually become more frequent recently. It is also in this situation that the United States was forced to sit down in Geneva to hold an East-West foreign ministers' meeting. During this period, Britain was more active than other Western countries in improving East-West relations. Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union in February this year not only improved Soviet-British relations and strengthened economic and cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and Britain, but also straightened Britain's back in dealing with the United States, and Britain gained greater say among the Western allies, further weakening the United States' leading position in the West. This made the United States feel that in order to regain the initiative from Britain and consolidate its crumbling "leader" position in the capitalist world, it was necessary to take steps to ease Soviet-American relations. In addition, at the Geneva East-West foreign ministers' meeting, the division of the Western front became more apparent, and the United States fell into an embarrassing situation of being unable to advance or retreat; on the one hand, in order to maintain the "unity" of the Western front, it was unwilling to reach any agreement; on the other hand, it was afraid of the strength and righteousness of the Soviet Union, and did not dare to brazenly break up; on the one hand, it was worried that refusing to participate in the East-West summit conference would put itself in greater isolation; on the other hand, it was worried that participating in the summit conference under the current situation would put itself in a more passive position. In order to get rid of this predicament, the United States wanted to find a way out by agreeing to mutual visits between the Soviet and American heads of state.

    In addition, next year is the U.S. presidential election year, and American politicians from both parties who are currently launching election campaigns have raised the issue of U.S.-Soviet relations to the center of their election campaigns. In order to gain political capital, the Republican government needs to strike a posture of loving peace even more. Just as Prime Minister Macmillan ran to Moscow before the British general election, after the Democratic former presidential candidate Stevenson visited the Soviet Union, the Republican government, in addition to sending the next presidential candidate Nixon to Moscow to host the opening ceremony of the American exhibition, also issued the "trump card" of agreeing to mutual visits between the Soviet and American heads of state, obviously in order to strengthen the Republican Party's position in next year's presidential election. All this shows that Eisenhower's invitation to Khrushchev to visit the United States was forced by the situation and against his will.

    How Much Sincerity Does the United States Have?

    However, no matter what the motives of the United States are, mutual visits between the heads of government of the Soviet Union and the United States are beneficial to further easing international tensions and maintaining the cause of world peace. Therefore, after this decision was announced, the Chinese people, like the peace-loving people all over the world, warmly welcomed this peace-promoting step. Vice Premier Chen Yi and Premier Zhou Enlai have both expressed this wish of the Chinese people in their speeches. Now, the Soviet head of government has set foot on American soil for the first time, and the whole world is closely concerned about this historic meeting between the leaders of the two countries, and expects this meeting to have positive results.

    Before leaving for the United States, Comrade Khrushchev said in his speech at the mass meeting in Vishny Volochyok: "We are going to the United States with the best wishes. We hope to do everything possible to eliminate the 'Cold War' state, so as to ease international tensions and create conditions for people to live and work in peace." This attitude of the Soviet Union is another manifestation of its consistent and unwavering pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy. As for the United States? Eisenhower said at a press conference on August 3 that he hoped that the upcoming exchange of views with the Soviet head of government would help melt the ice in U.S.-Soviet relations. In his speech on August 25, Eisenhower expressed his willingness to "engage in realistic negotiations with the Soviet Union on sensible and mutually assured plans for comprehensive disarmament or disarmament in special types of weapons; to lay a real foundation for resolving the various problems of a divided Germany, and to promote the easing of world tensions through other means." These statements are not bad. However, given the United States' past record of adhering to the "Cold War," we must not only "listen to what it says," but also "observe what it does." As Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "How much sincerity the U.S. government has in this regard remains to be demonstrated by future practical actions."

    It should be pointed out that the mutual visits between the Soviet and American heads of state have caused panic and opposition among powerful groups in the United States who are keen on the "Cold War." Not long ago, the repeated plunges in the New York stock market reflected the "peace fear" caused by this decision in the American monopoly groups. The U.S. "Cold War" defenders worry that "any easing of international tensions may cut defense (military) spending"; they also worry that mutual visits between Soviet and American leaders will affect their efforts to drive the United States' "allies" to expand their armies and prepare for war. They have tried their best to pour cold water on the American people's wish that the mutual visits between the Soviet and American leaders will achieve success, and have tried to belittle the significance of this decision. Some congressmen have made hysterical clamors, openly expressing their opposition to mutual visits, and even saying that this "marks one of the darkest days in American history" (Democratic Senator Dodd). In the U.S. government decision-makers, Deputy Secretary of State Dillon took the lead in shouting that this mutual visit does not mean that there is "any change in the basic policy" of the United States. Then, in his two speeches on August 16 and 25, Nixon, in addition to expressing his intention to continue to maintain "strength," also distorted the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and incited the people's anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments, and spread pessimistic air, saying that "goodwill and mutual understanding...cannot solve the deep and fundamental contradictions between the two countries." The generals of the Pentagon shouted even louder to resume nuclear testing. All this shows that when the "Cold War" ice begins to float due to the decision of the Soviet and American heads of state to visit each other, the counter-current of adhering to the "Cold War" is still surging in the United States.

    Even more noteworthy is that the United States is still continuing to pursue its policies of aggression and expansion and the Cold War in many areas. As people know, due to the stubborn attitude of the United States and other Western countries, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference did not achieve any concrete agreement on resolving mature international issues, so that the situation in Europe and the world could not be further eased, and not only that. The United States' practice of provoking a civil war in Laos and intensifying its interference in the situation in Laos has seriously threatened peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. In order to poison the international situation, the United States recently forced the United Nations Security Council to pass an illegal resolution to send a so-called fact-finding mission to Laos, making the situation in Laos even more complicated. At the same time, after the Sino-Indian border incident, the U.S. imperialists took the opportunity to add fuel to the fire, and tried their best to undermine the relations between China and India, attempting to pull India into a military aggression group, which is another example. What cannot be ignored is that the United States has not only not abandoned its overseas military bases aimed at encircling and invading the socialist camp, but is still making every effort to expand and strengthen these bases today, especially by stepping up the establishment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons bases in some of its vassal states in Europe and Asia. All these facts give people reason to remain vigilant about the easing stance expressed by the United States.

    Mutual visits between the Soviet and American heads of state are a great good thing. However, the United States is forced to accept easing, and has endless fears about easing. The "Cold War" forces are still struggling hard, and in order to make the United States adopt a more realistic policy on Soviet-American relations, and to make the mutual visits between the Soviet and American heads of state achieve positive results, the peace-loving people all over the world must continue to work hard, strengthen the struggle, and exert greater pressure on the U.S. imperialists.

    苏联和平外交的新胜利
    思慕
    苏联不倦的和平努力
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志已于15日到美国进行正式访问。不久之后，在今年秋天较晚的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔也将访问苏联。苏美两国政府首脑相互访问，是一个有助于改善苏美关系、缓和国际紧张局势的重要措施，是苏联和平外交政策的一次巨大胜利。
    一贯地主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处、和平竞赛的社会主义苏联，曾经为改善苏美关系作了很大的努力。世界各国人民也非常关心苏美关系的发展。这是因为，苏联和美国是世界上两个最强大的国家，它们彼此之间能否和平共处，对国际局势的发展会起决定性的作用。但是，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，由于美国发动了“冷战”，公开地推行反苏政策，使苏美之间的关系，一直陷于不正常状态。苏联曾经不止一次地表示了希望两国关系正常化的真诚愿望，并用种种实际行动来证明这种愿望。苏联曾经建议同美国签订五十年互不侵犯的条约，广泛地发展两国贸易和鼓励文化联系等等。但是，苏联每一次建议遇到的不是公开的反对，便是无理的拒绝。从1958年1月以来，苏联提出的召开大国首脑会议的建议，经过一年多来的一再推动，还是一再遭到美国方面的拖延拒绝。苏联一方面揭露美国这种阻挠行为，一方面坚持执行和平外交政策，继续努力促进苏美两国关系的改善。在苏共第二十一次代表大会中，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和总结发言，代表大会的决议都重申改善苏美关系的要求。所有这一切说明了，苏美两国政府首脑相互访问的促成，首先是苏联始终不渝地推行和平外交政策，不断地争取改善苏美关系的努力的结果，而美国终于同意两国政府首脑相互访问，是由于形势比人还强，逼不得已。
    形势逼人
    是什么形势迫使美国政府同意作出这个决定呢？
    第一，很明显的，这些年来，苏联和其他社会主义国家要求和平共处、通过和平协商解决国际争端、结束“冷战”、缓和国际紧张局势的不倦努力，已经一天比一天的深深打动全世界人民（包括美国人民在内）的心。苏联的伟大的七年计划的提出和执行，更向全世界人民表明，苏联是要争取长期的国际和平环境加速共产主义建设，是要同美国开展和平竞赛的。另一方面，美国坚持的“冷战”政策、“实力地位”政策和拒绝同苏联和平协商的僵硬态度，则日益丧失人心，受到全世界人民的反对，以至美国人民和它的一些盟国的反对。要求召开大国首脑会议，要求改善东西方关系已经成为目前国际形势发展的不可抗拒的强大主流，美国要继续死硬下去是越来越困难了。在全世界人民的强大压力之下，美国政府的决策人不得不接受某些缓和的做法，而美国同意这次相互访问，也就是这种缓和做法的一个尝试。
    第二，众所共见，这些年来，世界风向已经大变了，东风压倒西风，世界力量对比的变化越来越有利于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，而不利于以美国为首的帝国主义阵营。由于社会主义阵营无比强大，颠覆颠不破，硬碰碰不动，这由美国策动的匈牙利反革命事件的失败和美国在台湾海峡地区挑衅的碰壁，得到了证明。苏联的洲际导弹、三颗人造地球卫星、宇宙火箭和月球火箭一个接着一个发射成功之后，连美国方面也不能不承认苏联在军事上和在先进的科学技术上都已把美国抛在后面。这样，美国的“冷战”政策和“实力地位”政策的旧基础已经完全坍下来，美国幻想靠实力优势迫使苏联就范的如意算盘证明是完全打不通的。面对着这种新形势，美国统治集团中头脑比较现实的人，如凯南（前美国驻苏大使）、李普曼（有名的专栏作家）、华伯（美国银行家）和伊顿（美国企业家）等人最近都认为“冷战”政策已经此路不通。主张苏美直接谈判或举行大国首脑会议的呼声在美国也越来越高。甚至一向是反苏急先锋的杜勒斯，在他临死之前也不能不承认：“无论如何无法阻止苏联成为经济和军事力量日益强大的国家”，表示愿意同苏联坐下来讨论德国问题。艾森豪威尔在今年3月16日的电视演说中，谈到苏美关系时也被迫表示：“我们最后的选择仍然是举行谈判”；4月18日，美国副总统尼克松也承认：除了设法进行谈判，并没有另一条出路。正是在这种情况之下，最近美国同苏联的文化往来和两国政界人物的相互访问逐渐频繁。也是在这种形势之下，美国被迫同意在日内瓦坐下来举行东西方外长会议。在这期间，在改善东西方关系方面，英国比其他西方国家积极。今年2月麦克米伦首相对苏联的访问，不仅改善了苏英关系，密切了苏英之间的经济和文化的交流，而且使英国在同美国打交道的腰干也挺直了一些，英国在西方盟国中间也取得更大的发言权，从而进一步削弱了美国在西方的领导地位。这使美国感到：为了从英国手中夺回主动权，巩固它在资本主义世界中的摇摇欲坠的“盟主”地位，有必要采取缓和苏美关系的步骤。加之，在日内瓦东西方外长会议上，西方阵线的四分五裂更加表面化，美国陷入进退维谷的狼狈境地；它一方面为了保持西方阵线的“团结”，不愿达成任何协议；另一方面怕苏联的强大和理直气壮，又不敢悍然破裂；一方面担心拒绝参加东西方首脑会议将使自己陷于更大的孤立；他方面又顾虑在目前情况下参加首脑会议将使自己处于更加被动的地位。为了摆脱这种窘境，美国便想以同意苏美首脑的相互访问来找出一条出路。
    此外，明年是美国总统选举年，目前正在开始进行竞选活动的美国两党政治人物都把美苏关系问题提到了自己竞选活动的中心地位。共和党政府为了捞取政治资本，更有必要摆出爱好和平的姿态。正如麦克米伦首相在英国大选前跑莫斯科一趟那样，在民主党前总统候选人史蒂文森访问苏联之后，共和党政府除了派遣下届总统候选人尼克松到莫斯科主持美国展览会的开幕典礼之外，更发出了同意苏美首脑相互访问这张“王牌”，显然是为了加强共和党在明年总统竞选中的地位。这一切都说明，艾森豪威尔向赫鲁晓夫发出邀请访问美国的请帖，是迫于形势，情非得已。
    美国究竟有多大诚意？
    但是，不管美国方面的动机怎样，苏美两大国政府首脑互相访问，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平事业是有益的。所以，这一决定发表之后，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，热烈欢迎这一个有助于和平的步骤。陈毅副总理和周恩来总理都先后在讲话中表达了中国人民这个愿望。现在，苏联政府首脑已经第一次踏上美国国土了，全世界都密切地关心两国领导人这个历史性的会晤，期待着这个会见会有积极的成果。
    在动身到美国去之前，赫鲁晓夫同志在维申斯卡亚镇群众大会上的讲话中表示：“我们是怀着最好的愿望去美国访问的。我们希望尽一切努力来消除‘冷战’状态，从而缓和国际紧张局势，为人们的安居乐业创造条件。”苏联这种态度是它一贯坚定不移地奉行的和平外交政策的又一表现。至于美国方面呢？艾森豪威尔在8月3日的记者招待会上表示希望，即将同苏联政府首脑的交换意见将有助于融化美苏关系中的冰块。在8月25日的谈话中，艾森豪威尔表示愿意“就全面裁军或者特种类型武器方面的裁军的明智的和相互保障的计划同苏联进行现实的谈判；为解决分裂的德国的各项问题奠定真正的基础，并通过其他途径促使世界紧张局势的缓和。”这些表示是不坏的。但是，鉴于美国过去坚持“冷战”的纪录，我们不但要“听其言”，而且要“观其行”。正如陈毅副总理所说的，“美国政府在这方面究竟具有多大诚意，还有待于今后实际行动的证明。”
    应当指出，苏美首脑的相互访问已经在美国热中于“冷战”的有势力集团中引起了惊慌和反对。前不多时，纽约股票行市的一再暴跌，就反映出这个决定在美国垄断集团中所造成的“和平恐惧心理”。美国的“冷战”卫士们担心：“国际紧张局势的任何缓和都可能削减国防（军事）费用”；他们还担心苏美领导人的互访，将会影响他们驱策美国的“盟国”扩军备战的努力。他们极力给美国人民期望苏美领导人的互访将取得成就的心愿大泼冷水，企图贬低这个决定的意义。有些国会议员发出了歇斯底里的吵嚷，公开表示反对互访，甚至说这“标志着美国历史上最黑暗的日子之一”（民主党参议员多德）。在美国政府决策人中，副国务卿狄龙带头叫喊，说这次相互访问并不意味着美国“基本政策有任何改变”。接着，尼克松于8月16日和25日两次讲话中除了表示要继续保持“实力”之外，还歪曲苏联的和平外交政策和煽动人民的反苏反共情绪，并散播悲观的空气，说“善意和相互了解……不能解决两国之间深刻的根本的矛盾”。五角大楼的将军们更大声叫嚣要恢复核试验。所有这一切说明，在“冷战”冰块因苏美首脑决定互访而开始浮动的时候，坚持“冷战”的逆流仍在美国汹涌。
    更值得注意的，美国在许多方面仍然继续推行它的侵略扩张和冷战政策。人们知道，由于美国和其他西方国家的顽固态度，日内瓦外长会议并未就解决已成熟的国际问题取得任何具体的协议，从而使欧洲和世界的局势不能进一步缓和下来，不止如此。美国挑起老挝内战和加紧干涉老挝局势的做法，已使印度支那和东南亚的和平受到严重的威胁。为了毒化国际局势，美国最近强使联合国安全理事会通过一项派遣所谓调查团到老挝的非法决议，使老挝的局势更为复杂化。与此同时，在中印边境事件发生后，美帝国主义者乘机煽风点火，极力破坏中印两国的关系，企图把印度拉入军事侵略集团，又是一个例子。更不能使人忽视的是，美国不但没有放弃以包围和侵略社会主义阵营为目的的海外军事基地，而且今天还在竭力扩充和加强这些基地，特别是还在欧亚两洲它的一些仆从国家内加紧建立原子武器和火箭武器基地。所有这些事实使人们有理由对美国所表示的缓和姿态，保持警惕的态度。
    苏美首脑的相互访问，是一件大好事。但是，美国被迫接受缓和，又对缓和抱无穷的恐惧。“冷战”势力仍在极力挣扎，要使美国对苏美关系采取较现实的政策，要使苏美首脑的互相访问取得积极的成果，全世界爱好和平的人民，还要再接再厉，加强斗争，向美帝国主义者施加更大的压力。
