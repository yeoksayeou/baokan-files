Xinhua News Agency, September 28th. Ethnic minority delegations from all over the country have been arriving in Beijing successively to participate in the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

A total of sixteen ethnic minority delegations and three ethnic minority youth study groups, totaling more than 1,100 people and representing more than 50 ethnic groups, have come to Beijing this time. This is the largest delegation since the founding of the People's Republic of China, symbolizing the unprecedented unity of all ethnic groups in our country.

The members of the delegations are mostly ethnic minority model workers in industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, advanced workers, activists who emerged during the democratic reforms and socialist transformation, and leading cadres of the people's communes; a small number are leading cadres at all levels in ethnic minority areas; in addition, there are some people from the ethnic upper class and religious circles. They come from the remote borders of the motherland, the vast grasslands, mountainous areas, and coasts, bringing the love and blessings of nearly 40 million ethnic minorities for the motherland, the Communist Party of China, and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao. Many former serfs from the Tibet region are coming to the capital of the motherland for the first time, filled with the happiness of being masters of their own affairs after emancipation.

The ethnic minority delegations were warmly welcomed by the people of the capital, the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress upon their arrival in Beijing. During their stay in Beijing, in addition to participating in the National Day celebration meeting and the National Day parade, they will also listen to reports from relevant central leaders, and visit major exhibitions in the capital, as well as factories, people's communes, large-scale water conservancy projects, etc.
