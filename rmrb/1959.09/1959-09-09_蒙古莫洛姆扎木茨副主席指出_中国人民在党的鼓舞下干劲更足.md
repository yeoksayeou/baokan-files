Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 8th: Mongolian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Molomjamts held a reception in Ulaanbaatar this afternoon to welcome the Chinese government delegation for the handover. In his speech at the reception, he said that the recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction and made important resolutions to continue the leap forward. On the eve of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the great National Day, the Chinese people, encouraged and called upon by the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, have shown even greater enthusiasm. No slander or attack by imperialism on China's achievements can stop the Chinese people from moving forward.

Molomjamts said that the Chinese people will achieve greater successes in socialist construction to strengthen the socialist camp and the forces defending world peace.

In his speech, Molomjamts thanked the Chinese people for their help to Mongolia. He said that the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people is constantly developing.

The Chinese government delegation for the handover came here to hand over two factories built with Chinese assistance to Mongolia.

These two factories have already been handed over for production on September 5.

Cao Lu, head of the delegation and Assistant Minister of Light Industry, said in his speech at the reception that he firmly believes that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

Before the reception, Molomjamts met with the Chinese government delegation.
