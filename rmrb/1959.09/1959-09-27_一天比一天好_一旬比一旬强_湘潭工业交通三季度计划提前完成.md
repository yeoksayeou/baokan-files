Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 25th: Workers in the industrial and transportation systems of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, have pre-fulfilled and surpassed their third-quarter plans. As of September 15th, the city's total industrial output value reached 102.88% of the plan; transportation and freight volume reached 102.39% of the plan. The plan completion rates for major products are: steel 129.65%, iron 100%, manganese ore 100.46%, cotton yarn 100%, refractory materials 100.13%, and rubber wire 129.92%.

    After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party were published, a new situation rapidly emerged in production in all walks of life throughout the city. Plan completion got better every day and stronger every ten days. The city's total industrial output value increased by 20.52% in mid-August compared to early August, 76.44% in late August compared to mid-August, and 6.73% in early September compared to late August. In terms of capital construction, the total investment completed in August was equivalent to 134% of that in July, and the amount completed in the first half of September was equal to 81% of the total for August.

    Some things that were previously considered impossible are now not only being done but are also being done faster and more economically than expected. For example, at the beginning of August, the woodworking factory lacked confidence in completing the quarterly plan ten days ahead of schedule and requested that the planned output value be reduced from 500,000 yuan to 390,000 yuan. After criticizing right-leaning sentiments and greatly encouraging revolutionary zeal, the plan was not reduced, and the quarterly plan was completed twelve days ahead of schedule.

    Since mid-August, more than 70% of the responsible cadres of Party organizations at all levels throughout the city have gone deep into the front lines of production to work alongside the workers or to cultivate experimental plots in key departments, thereby promoting the in-depth development of the increased production and frugality movement. After the Party committee secretary and factory director of the Xiangtan Electric Wire Factory went to the workshops, they mobilized the masses in various forms, overcame 245 key problems in August, and prominently solved the problems of production water and raw material supply, thus completing the third-quarter production plan 15 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 12.21%.

    一天比一天好　一旬比一旬强
    湘潭工业交通三季度计划提前完成
    新华社长沙25日电　湖南湘潭市工业和交通运输系统职工已提前超额完成第三季度计划。到9月15日止，全市工业总产值完成102.88％；交通运输货运量完成102.39％。主要产品产量计划完成情况是：钢129.65％，铁100％，锰矿石100.46％，棉纱100％，耐火材料100.13％，橡皮线129.92％。
    党的八届八中全会公报和决议公布以后，全市各行各业的生产迅速出现新的局面，完成计划情况一天比一天好，一旬比一旬强。全市工业总产值，8月中旬比上旬增长了20.52％，下旬比中旬增长了76.44％，而9月上旬又比8月下旬增长了6.73％；基本建设方面，8月份完成投资总额相当于7月份的134％，9月上半月完成量等于8月全月的81％。
    有些过去认为无法办到的事，现在不但办到了，而且办得比预计的更快、更省。如木工厂8月初对提前十天完成季度计划信心不足，要求把计划产值由五十万元减到三十九万元；经过批判右倾情绪、大鼓革命干劲以后，计划没有缩减，而且提前十二天完成了季度计划。
    8月中旬以来，全市各级党组织的负责干部，有70％以上都深入到生产第一线跟班劳动，或者到关键部门去种试验田，从而促进了增产节约运动的深入展开。湘潭电线厂的党委书记和厂长下到车间以后，用各种形式发动群众，8月份就拿下了二百四十五个关键，并且突出地解决了生产用水和原料材料的供应问题，因而提前十五天超额12.21％完成了第三季度生产计划。
