Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 14th: The Indian Communist newspaper "Freedom Daily" published an editorial on the 13th entitled "The Sino-Indian Border Issue," stating, "Because the border issue is very complex, the Indian government and the Chinese government must sit down together to fully and appropriately resolve the McMahon Line and the Sino-Indian border issue. The border cannot be resolved by clamoring and creating tension. This must be peacefully resolved through negotiations by the heads of government of the two countries or their government representatives. This is the only way. Any other approach will only help the imperialist conspiracy to undermine the independence and sovereignty of India and China."

The editorial pointed out that the Indian government and the Chinese government have been exchanging letters on the border dispute issue for a long time. In the Chinese government's reply on September 8th to the Indian government's letter to China in March of this year, the issue has become very clear. After the March letter, the Tibet incident reached its peak. The situation only began to become serious after a large number of Tibetan rebels attempted to flee to India. The spiritual support given to the Tibetan rebels by certain parties in India, as well as the Dalai Lama's propaganda, created a background for opposition to China's provocations. But unfortunately, the propaganda being carried out by some people in our country now seems to suggest that war is about to break out and that India has been invaded. And those who once said that Panchsheel was born in sin have now begun to shout that India has been invaded and that Sino-Indian relations have deteriorated. Some members of the Congress Party are also conducting similar propaganda. The editorial said, "No one benefits from this propaganda except imperialism."

The editorial said, "The border issue is very serious, and the situation is also particularly serious. Therefore, it is also very necessary to study the whole issue calmly and patiently. We are willing to announce to our compatriots with firm conviction that India cannot be threatened by socialist China; this threat can only come from Anglo-American imperialist conspirators. The whole thing has been explained in detail by the Chinese Premier in his letter."

The editorial continued, "It is precisely because there are differences of opinion regarding the Sino-Indian border dispute that the Communist Party and many well-intentioned people in India are calling for immediate negotiations." The editorial pointed out that the attempt to conflate Tibetan independence and independent status with the Sino-Indian border issue regarding the McMahon Line complicates the issue further. It said, "This is very clear to politically conscious compatriots. The tricks of the Anglo-American imperialists revolve around this point, and will continue to do so in the future. This is precisely what brings great danger to India and China. It is not appropriate for us to remain silent and indifferent to this."

### 印共“自由报”发表社论指出  中印边界问题必须通过谈判解决  进行反华叫嚷只有利于帝国主义

    印共“自由报”发表社论指出
    中印边界问题必须通过谈判解决
    进行反华叫嚷只有利于帝国主义
    新华社新德里14日电　印度共产党报纸“自由报”在13日发表一篇题为“印中边界问题”的社论说，“由于边界问题非常复杂，印度政府和中国政府必须坐在一起充分而恰当地解决麦克马洪线和印中边界问题。凭叫嚷和制造紧张局势是不能使这条边界得到解决的。这必须由两国政府首脑或它们的政府代表通过谈判加以和平解决。这是唯一的办法。任何其他办法都只会有助于帝国主义破坏印中两国的独立和主权的阴谋。”
    社论指出，印度政府和中国政府就边界争执问题互通信件也已经有很长一个时期。在中国政府9月8日对印度政府今年3月给中国的信件的答复中，问题已经变得很清楚。在3月的信件以后，西藏事件达到了高峰。局势只是在大批西藏叛乱分子试图逃到印度之后才开始严重起来的。印度某些党派给西藏叛乱分子的那种精神上的支持以及达赖喇嘛进行宣传的那种做法，为反对中国的挑衅创造了背景。但是不幸的是，我国有一些人现在进行的那种宣传，似乎战争即将爆发，印度已被侵略。而那些曾经说潘查希拉是在罪恶中诞生的人现在已经开始大叫印度受到侵略，并且使印中关系发生了恶化。一些国大党人也在进行类似的宣传。社论说，“从这种宣传中得到好处的没有别人，只有帝国主义。”
    社论说，“边界问题非常严重，局势也是特别严重的。因此，冷静而且耐心地研究整个问题也是非常必要的。我们愿意怀着坚定的信念向同胞们宣布的一点，就是印度不可能受到来自社会主义中国的威胁，这种威胁只会来自英美帝国主义阴谋家。整个事情已经由中国总理在他的信中详加说明了。”
    社论接着说，“正是由于对于印中边界争执存在着分歧意见，因此共产党和印度的许多善意的人要求立即举行谈判。”社论指出，把西藏独立及独立地位和关于麦克马洪线的印中边界问题混淆在一起的这种企图，使得问题更加复杂化了。它说，“对于在政治上清醒的同胞们来说，这是非常清楚的。英美帝国主义者的鬼把戏就是围绕这一点来进行的，而且在今后还将继续进行下去。给印度和中国带来巨大危险的也正是这一点。对我们来说，对此保持沉默和漠不关心是不适宜的。”
