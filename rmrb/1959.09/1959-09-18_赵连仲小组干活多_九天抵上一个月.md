Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric - The Zhao Lianzhong group of workers in the steel beam workshop of the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory have completed their September production task of manufacturing bridge equipment for the Yellow River Bridge twenty-one days ahead of schedule.

	The Zhao Lianzhong group is a model group in this factory. Since the beginning of this year, they have been vigorously engaged in technological innovation, improved work efficiency, and created an excellent achievement of completing the annual workload in five months. After the publication of the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the group workers were determined to complete the September production task ahead of schedule, and immediately launched a competition with each other. From August 28 to September 7, the entire group innovated five technologies, and Zhao Lianzhong alone innovated three. When rushing to produce the bent columns for the Yellow River Bridge, Zhao Lianzhong worked hard for two days to make an automatic boom to replace manual handling of large iron plates weighing more than 200 pounds, and also created a special tool die, which not only saves manpower but also improves work efficiency. The September production task of eleven bent columns for the bridge was completed by the 3rd. Zhao Lianzhong also helped Wang Fusheng in the group to improve the oil press, solving the key problem of large iron plates and inconvenient operation in the production of oil tank panels, and increasing production efficiency threefold.

    赵连仲小组干活多
    九天抵上一个月
    新华社天津电　山海关桥梁厂钢梁车间赵连仲小组工人，已经提前二十一天完成了9月份制造黄河大桥桥梁设备的生产任务。
    赵连仲小组是这个厂的模范小组，今年以来大搞技术革新，提高了工作效率，创造了五个月完成全年工作量的优异成绩。党的八届八中全会公报和决议发表以后，小组工人决心提前完成9月份生产任务，并且立即展开了对手竞赛。从8月28日到9月7日，全组工人共革新技术五项，赵连仲一人就革新了三项。在赶制黄河大桥桥梁弯立柱时，赵连仲苦战两天，制成一个自动吊杆，代替人力搬二百多斤重的大铁板，还创造了一种专用工具胎，既省人力，又提高工作效率。9月份十一孔桥梁弯立柱的生产任务，到3日就完成了。赵连仲还帮助组内的王福生改进了压油机，解决生产油槽板用的铁板大、操作不方便的关键问题，提高生产效率三倍。
