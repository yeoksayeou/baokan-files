　　Song Sheets and Songs

　　In carrying out socialist singing activities, we have created a good way to promote revolutionary songs - song sheets. It has played a significant role in deepening socialist singing activities and resisting the poison of yellow (music).

　　Song sheets are not only welcomed for their small and exquisite size, but also loved by the masses for their revolutionary content. Therefore, the printing volume of song sheets is very large. We should take such a large number of song sheets, which are popular among the masses, seriously. However, it is regrettable that some publishers have not done so. When printing song sheets, they have selected some songs that are not very healthy, causing harmful effects.

　　Songs that are printed on song sheets are actually in the nature of a recommendation. Therefore, publishers are required to treat this work seriously and responsibly for the readers!　Wang Weiqun

    歌片和歌
    在开展社会主义歌咏活动中，我们创造了一种推广革命歌曲的好形式——歌片。它对社会主义歌咏活动的深入开展和抵制黄色（音乐）毒素都起了不小的作用。
    歌片，不但以它小巧玲珑受人欢迎，而且以它革命的内容为广大群众所喜爱，因此，歌片的印刷量是很大的。对于这样大量印刷、深受群众欢迎的歌片，我们就应该严肃地对待它。但是，遗憾的是有些出版者却没有这样做，他们在印制歌片的时候，把一些不十分健康的歌曲也选择了进去，造成有害影响。
    凡是印成歌片的歌曲，实际上是负有推荐的性质，因此要求出版者严肃认真地对待这项工作，必须为读者负责！　王为群
