Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Various branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively beautifying their camps, erecting colorful arches, rehearsing cultural programs, and preparing various exhibitions and report meetings, joyfully welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation.

　　In Beijing, the troops have launched a vigorous publicity campaign for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the nation. Officers and soldiers who are good at writing and drawing have given the camps a new look. In various clubs, several columns have been opened to publicize the great victory of the Party's General Line and the great achievements of our army in defending and building the motherland and moving towards modernization. The Shanghai Garrison's military club is working day and night to arrange the venue, preparing to open to the public on October 1st. Among them, the exhibition on "Protecting Shanghai, Building Shanghai for Ten Years" systematically introduces the achievements of this unit over the past ten years. Air Force and Navy units stationed in Shanghai have also compiled many brilliant programs, preparing to go to factories and rural areas for publicity performances around National Day. In Zhejiang, soldiers of various units have learned to sing new songs praising the motherland's Great Leap Forward, the General Line, and the People's Commune. Many soldiers have also written poems and painted to beautify the camps. The troops stationed on Dachen Island have also joined with the local government and the masses to form an amateur cultural troupe to rehearse cultural programs such as "Dachen Military-Civilian Joint Defense." A certain unit stationed in Xinjiang has established a military exhibition hall to introduce the glorious history of this unit's hard work and growth since the Red Army era, and to conduct traditional education for officers and soldiers.

　　On the Fujian front, while beautifying their positions and preparing for the celebration of National Day, the army, navy, and air force have strengthened their vigilance, ready to strike at invading enemies at any time and protect the coastal people in celebrating National Day.

　　Under the slogan of "Greet National Day Cleanly," the troops have launched a vigorous autumn patriotic health campaign, focusing on environmental sanitation. The commander of the "Tashan Hero Regiment," Combat Hero Major Cheng Yuanmao, led his troops in a five-day battle, making the camp look radiant. A certain unit stationed in Hainan Island planted many coconut and banana trees during the patriotic health campaign. Some even used coral and shells to inlay slogans such as "Long Live the Great Leap Forward" and "Long Live the General Line" along the roadside. Under the leadership of Deputy Commander Major General Lu Ruilin, the troops in the Kunming area have focused on environmental sanitation. Many units have clean and bright rooms, and outdoor flower beds and flower gardens are in full bloom. A certain unit in the Shenyang area, rated as a "first-class health model" by the local government, recently sent more than 1,000 people to help the people remove garbage and fill in depressions and ditches. Some units also sent propaganda vehicles to the streets to publicize the significance of the health campaign.
