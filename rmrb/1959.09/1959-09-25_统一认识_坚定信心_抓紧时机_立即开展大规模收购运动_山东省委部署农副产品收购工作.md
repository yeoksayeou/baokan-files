According to the Dazhong Daily News, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a telephone conference on the 21st of this month, requesting the immediate launch of a massive, mass-based procurement campaign for agricultural and sideline products, striving to complete and exceed the procurement tasks for grain and agricultural and sideline products ahead of schedule.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out at the meeting: Shandong, having overcome a severe drought and achieved a bumper harvest of early autumn crops, is now seeing good growth in late autumn grain crops, cotton, peanuts, tobacco, and other crops. With the development of diversified economies in the people's communes, the quantity of local and special products has also greatly increased, providing a solid material foundation for completing various agricultural product procurement tasks. Encouraged by the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the vast number of commercial workers are opposing right-leaning tendencies, boosting their energy, and extensively launching red flag emulation drives. The progress of various agricultural and sideline product procurement efforts has greatly accelerated. By September 20th, nearly 1.3 billion jin of early autumn grain had been procured, an increase of more than 2.084 times compared to the same period last year. By September 20th, 523,000 dan of cotton had been procured, an increase of 1.73 times compared to the same period last year. From September 1st to 20th, 190,000 head of pigs were procured, an increase of 1.13 times compared to the procurement quantity in July and August. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that the procurement of agricultural and sideline products is a highly seasonal task. If we seize the next two to three months tightly and complete the tasks well, we can take the initiative for the whole year. Otherwise, it will create unnecessary passivity for future work. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must earnestly seize the current favorable opportunity, do a good job in grain purchase and sale, strengthen leadership in agricultural product procurement work, and treat it as an important task for rural work in autumn and winter.

In carrying out the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, it should be clear that the focus should be on doing a good job in the procurement of major agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, tobacco, and pigs, while comprehensively doing a good job in the procurement of other agricultural and sideline products. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee believes that, first, we must unify the understanding of the entire Party and strengthen our determination and confidence in completing the annual grain procurement task. As a result of the courageous drought resistance struggle of the people throughout the province, this year's total grain output will still exceed last year's level. In particular, the harvest is more meticulous than last year, and the masses are saving more grain than last year, so completing the procurement task is entirely possible. Currently, some cadres and commune members have some erroneous views on the grain issue, and therefore are not actively completing the tasks assigned by the state in accordance with national policies. This is the main danger in the current grain procurement work. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, thoroughly expose and criticize various right-leaning ideas, conscientiously implement the Party's policies, and resolutely ensure the completion of the state-determined grain procurement task. At the same time, we must rationally control grain sales from beginning to end, strictly control grain sales, and resolutely ensure that the sales targets allocated by the province are not exceeded. We must vigorously conduct education on saving grain among urban and rural people.

The Provincial Party Committee also requires all localities to comprehensively do a good job in the procurement of cotton, tobacco, hemp, oilseeds, and pigs and other non-staple foods while focusing on grain purchase and sale. To this end, all localities must quickly check and fully prepare for procurement, especially the organizational work of the procurement force. We must truly achieve receiving upon arrival and timely procurement. In addition, while seizing the procurement of major agricultural products, we must also conscientiously do a good job in the procurement of local and special products, small oilseeds, wild fibers, wild oilseeds, wild starches, and other materials. We must promptly procure everything useful.

In order to ensure the completion of the agricultural and sideline product procurement task, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, fully mobilize the masses, and vigorously launch mass movements. In procurement work, we must comprehensively implement the three major viewpoints of serving politics, serving production, and serving the masses. It should be recognized that doing a good job in grain purchase and sale and agricultural and sideline product procurement is an economic task and also a political task. Therefore, in the course of work, we must adhere to the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements, and resolutely act in accordance with the Party's policies. For grain procurement, we must resolutely complete the procurement task, but also avoid buying excessive grain. For grain sales, we must strictly control them, but also make good arrangements for the lives of urban and rural people. For cotton, oilseeds, and other procurements, we must also resolutely implement the policies and methods stipulated by the Provincial Party Committee. We must conscientiously do a good job in all business preparations for procurement work, so that business work is fully adapted to the requirements of the procurement campaign. At present, we should especially seize the improvement and enrichment of procurement agency personnel, truly achieving that the commune, team, and masses sell as much as they want, receive as much as they sell, and accept whenever they are delivered, so as to facilitate the masses to sell. At the same time, we must do a good job in the allocation and supply of means of production and means of livelihood, so that procurement and supply are fully integrated. In order to ensure that the procured agricultural and sideline products are transported to cities in a timely manner to supply industrial production and market needs, we must make unified arrangements and closely link procurement and transportation to save labor. Procurement departments at all levels should also designate necessary responsible cadres to directly manage transportation and storage work. And conscientiously do a good job in fire prevention, theft prevention, insect prevention, and rot prevention, strictly preventing accidents. At the same time, from the province to all levels of financial and trade departments, we must immediately organize a major inspection of financial and trade work throughout the province. The content of the inspection is mainly to support the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing and sowing) and the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and to organize and promote the high tide of the agricultural and sideline product procurement campaign. And in conjunction with the inspection, promote the work of fiscal revenue and expenditure, savings, credit, and organization of exports.

    统一认识　坚定信心　抓紧时机
    立即开展大规模收购运动
    山东省委部署农副产品收购工作
    据大众日报消息　中共山东省委于本月21日召开电话会议，要求立即开展一个声势浩大的群众性的农副产品收购运动，争取提前超额完成粮食和农副产品的收购任务。
    省委在会上指出：山东在战胜了严重干旱，获得早秋作物丰收之后，目前晚秋粮食作物和棉花、花生、烤烟等作物也都生长良好；随着人民公社多种经济的发展，土特产品的数量也都大大增加，这为完成各项农产品采购任务，提供了雄厚的物质基础。广大商业职工在党的八届八中全会公报和决议的鼓舞下，反右倾，鼓干劲，广泛展开红旗竞赛，各项农副产品采购进度都大大加快，到9月20日止，已收购早秋粮食近十三亿斤，比去年同期增加了二点零八四倍以上；9月20日止已收购棉花五十二万三千担，比去年同期增加了一点七三倍；9月1日到20日收购毛猪十九万头，比7、8两个月的收购数量增加一点一三倍。省委强调指出：农副产品的收购，是季节性很强的工作，今后两三个月抓的紧，任务完成的好，就可以争取全年的主动。反之，就会对今后工作造成不应有的被动现象。因此，各级党委必须切实抓紧当前的大好时机，搞好粮食购销，加强农产品收购工作的领导，把它作为秋、冬农村工作的一项重要任务。
    在开展农副产品收购工作中，应当明确要以搞好粮、棉、油、烟、猪等主要农副产品的收购为主，同时全面做好其他农副产品的收购工作。为此，省委认为，首先，必须统一全党认识，坚定完成全年粮食征购任务的决心和信心。由于全省人民奋勇抗旱斗争的结果，今年粮食总产量仍将超过去年的水平，特别是收获比去年细致，群众吃粮食比去年节约，完成征购任务也是完全有条件的。当前一部分干部和社员群众中，在粮食问题上有一些错误观点，因而不积极按照国家政策完成国家所分配的任务。这是当前粮食征购工作中的主要危险。各级党委必须认真贯彻党的八届八中全会和省委扩大会议的精神，彻底揭发和批判各种右倾思想，认真贯彻党的政策，坚决保证完成国家确定的粮食征购任务。同时，要自始至终地合理掌握粮食统销，严格控制粮食销量，坚决保证不突破省分配的销售指标。在城乡人民中大力进行节约用粮的教育。
    省委还要求各地在抓好粮食购销的同时，必须全面抓好棉、烟、麻、油料和生猪等副食品的收购。为此，各地要迅速检查和充分做好收购的准备工作，特别是收购力量的组织工作。真正做到随到随收，及时收购。此外，在抓紧主要农产品收购的同时，也要认真地抓好土副产品、小油料、野生纤维、野生油料、野生淀粉等物资的收购工作。要把一切有用的东西，都及时收购起来。
    为了保证完成农副产品的收购任务，各级党委加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，充分发动群众，大搞群众运动。在收购工作中，必须全面地贯彻为政治服务、为生产服务、为群众服务的三大观点。应当认识，搞好粮食购销和农副产品收购工作，是一项经济任务，也是一项政治任务。因此，在工作进行中必须坚持统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则，坚决按照党的政策办事。对于粮食收购，既要坚决完成收购任务，又能作到不买过头粮；对于粮食销售，既要严加控制，又能很好安排城乡人民的生活；对棉花、油料等收购，也必须坚决贯彻执行省委规定的政策和办法。要切实做好收购工作的各项业务准备，做到业务工作完全适应采购运动的要求。目前特别应当抓紧采购机构人员的健全和充实，真正做到社、队、群众卖多少，收多少，什么时候送到，什么时候接受，便利群众出售。同时，要做好生产资料和生活资料的调拨供应工作，使收购、供应完全结合起来。为了保证把收购起来的农副产品及时运往城市，供应工业生产和市场的需要，必须统一安排，把收购和调运紧密衔接起来，以节省劳力。各级采购部门还应当指定必要的负责干部，直接掌握调运保管工作。并认真做好防火、防盗、防虫、防烂，严格防止发生事故。同时，从省到各级财贸部门还要立即组织全省财贸工作大检查。检查的内容，主要是支援“三秋”和农副产品收购，组织推动农副产品采购运动的高潮。并且结合检查推动财政收支、储蓄、信贷、组织出口等项工作。
