Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 27th: The autumn harvest work in Hebei Province has been widely unfolded. Five million strong are wielding their sickles, rejoicing in a bumper grain harvest. By September 15th, the province had harvested over 25 million mu of early autumn crops such as spring millet, corn, sorghum, and naked oats, accounting for 55% of the early autumn crops. Based on the actual yields already obtained, it can be seen that this year's various crops have generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to previous years, and all are higher than the original planned production targets.

Since the start of the harvest, many large-area high-yield fields have emerged in various places. Yongnian County's 110,000 mu of spring millet achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of 360 jin per mu, an increase of 20% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of last year. Among them, 50,000 mu yielded more than 500 jin per mu, and there were 24 mu of high-yield fields with yields exceeding 1,000 jin. Comrade Zhou Zhenhua, Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, and the Dongfeng Commune of Qinhuangdao jointly cultivated 113 mu of high-yield sorghum, with a yield of more than 1,020 jin per mu. The Chengguan Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Leting County harvested 403 mu of multi-headed sorghum, with an average actual yield of 813 jin per mu, including 43 mu of experimental fields with a yield of 1,070 jin per mu.

The bumper harvest of grain crops once again demonstrates the unparalleled vitality of the people's communes in overcoming natural disasters. During the spring sowing period this year, the province generally lacked rain. People's communes in various places organized an army of more than 9 million people to fight drought and sow seeds, persisting in the drought resistance movement for three months, drilling 60,000 machine wells, and newly building and repairing more than 110,000 canals, expanding the irrigation area by more than 7.6 million mu. They also adopted methods such as fighting day and night, keeping the wells working without rest, and sowing seeds while irrigating, ensuring that more than 10 million mu of dry land was sown in a timely manner. After the summer, although some areas experienced floods, under the unified leadership of the communes, an army of 180,000 people was immediately organized to drain the water, with unified planning and unified action, overcoming the contradictions between upstream and downstream, reducing severe disasters, minimizing major disasters, and preventing minor disasters from reducing production. In particular, the early completion of the first phase of the six major reservoirs of Gangnan, Huangbizhuang, Wangkuai, Xidayang, Hengshanling, and Miyun played a role in flood control during the flood season, basically controlling the flow of the Chaobai River, Tang River, Hutuo River, and Zhulong River, ensuring that the vast plains downstream were protected from water damage for major autumn crops.

The bumper harvest of grain crops greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of farmers throughout the province. During the harvest, a mass "Six Goods" (good harvesting, good threshing, good collecting, good selling, good distribution, good storage) competition movement was widely launched throughout the province. Various places have also rationally arranged the labor force, promoted the responsibility acceptance system, and established different specialized teams for harvesting processes such as cutting, pulling, threshing, and picking, implementing assembly line operations to achieve timely harvesting, harvesting while cutting, transporting and threshing while cutting, and putting into storage, picking up in the fields while cutting, without losing any plants or ears; spreading thinly and evenly on the threshing floor, and threshing and winnowing carefully. Through these methods, it is estimated that the province has harvested more than 10 million jin of grain more than expected.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 27th: The mid-season rice in Fujian is gradually ripening from north to south. The early-maturing areas are rushing to harvest, and news of large-scale bumper harvests is constantly coming. The Changguangke Production Team of the Huaqiao Commune in Guangze County, Wuyi Mountain area, achieved an average yield of 694 jin per mu on 125 mu of mid-season rice, an increase of nearly 70% compared to last year.

Due to climatic and seasonal reasons, Fujian Province's more than 1.7 million mu of mid-season rice are planted in the vast mountainous areas. Mid-season rice fields are generally relatively barren; mountainous areas have more land and fewer people. During the mid-season rice transplanting period, it is the busy season for the field management of early rice and preparing for the planting of single-season late rice. Due to insufficient labor, mid-season rice cultivation has always been relatively extensive and yields have been low. However, this year, thanks to the people's communes, this situation has completely changed. Communes and production brigades have rationally arranged labor, dispatched long-distance farming teams and mountain farming teams, etc., to carry out deep plowing of barren mid-season rice fields, increase the application of fertilizers, improve water conservancy conditions, and carry out timely and meticulous planting and field management, resulting in an all-round bumper harvest. In order to change people's disregard for mid-season rice, the Shuiji Commune in Jianyang County had all 120 production team leaders and above, together with commune members, plant more than 600 mu of mid-season rice experimental fields and high-yield fields. These fields became "command fields," promoting the intensive cultivation of mid-season rice fields throughout the commune, and mid-season rice generally achieved a bumper harvest. Encouraged by the bumper harvest of mid-season rice, commune members in various places are enthusiastically launching a late-autumn overproduction movement, striving for "late rice exceeding mid-season rice, and a comprehensive bumper harvest."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 27th: Mid-season rice in various parts of Guangdong Province has ripened, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. Harvest news continues to come from Hainan Island and Shaoguan area in northern Guangdong, where harvesting started earlier. The Huabei Brigade of the Yelin Commune in Yaxian County, Hainan Island, has harvested 624 mu, with an average yield increase of more than 10% compared to last year. The Jiufengqiao Production Team of the Lian'an Brigade of the Jiufeng People's Commune in Lechang County, northern Guangdong, has harvested four mu of mid-season rice, with an average yield increase of about 100% compared to last year.

Guangdong has never planted much mid-season rice. This year, a total of 1.56 million mu of mid-season rice were planted. These mid-season rice fields are mostly coastal fields and mountain pit fields. In the past, due to poor soil and water conservancy conditions, coupled with rough cultivation, yields were not high. After communization last year, the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" was fully implemented, especially the improvement of water conservancy conditions, as well as deep plowing, soil improvement, and appropriate close planting, so mid-season rice generally grew well. In field management, the past habit of only planting and not managing was changed, and more weeding, more fertilization, and rational drainage and irrigation were implemented. Therefore, although there were particularly many natural disasters this year, a general bumper harvest was still achieved.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 27th: More than 4.5 million mu of cotton in Shanxi Province generally show a bumper harvest. Commune members in various places are stepping up the picking and selling of new cotton to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country. Up to now, Jin Southeast Prefecture alone has purchased more than 7 million jin of new cotton (lint). Major textile mills in Shanxi Province have begun to use new cotton for production.

Judging from the cotton growth and harvesting situation in various places, although major cotton-producing areas such as Southern Shanxi and Southeastern Shanxi have suffered a relatively long drought, thanks to the great power of the people's communes in overcoming drought, this year's cotton is still trending towards a bumper harvest. After a recent major inspection in Yicheng County and the suburbs of Houma City, the masses generally agreed that this year's cotton is better than any previous year. According to the results of initial picking and yield measurement, it will generally increase by more than 10% compared to last year. The Dengzhuang Management Area of the Dengzhuang Commune in Linfen County, which achieved a large-scale bumper harvest last year, calculates that this year each mu of more than 1,100 mu of dryland cotton fields can increase production by 10 jin compared to last year based on the picking situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 26th: More than 7 million mu of cotton in Jiangsu Province are covered in silvery floss, with bolls hanging heavily, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest everywhere. Commune members in cotton-growing areas are stepping up the picking of new cotton, determined to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the country with practical actions to guarantee a bumper harvest. In Dongtai County, a major cotton-producing area, after careful picking by commune members, 12 million jin of new cotton have been collected, five times more than in the same period last year.

During the boll-forming period of cotton in Jiangsu's cotton-growing areas, the temperature was high, the sunshine was sufficient, and the boll shedding rate was generally reduced by half compared to last year, and the autumn bolls were particularly numerous. The early maturity period of early cotton bolls was also shortened by more than ten days compared to previous years, and the bolls began to crack and fluff in early August. Seeing the numerous bolls and good flowers, commune members happily sang, "Bolls as big as eggs, Floss as white as silver, Flowers surge like tides, People look at the flowers and rejoice, Flowers smile at people."

Various cotton-producing areas have adopted effective measures to ensure a bumper harvest. The Siyang County Party Committee held an on-site cotton harvesting meeting in early September, requiring that "no cotton be left inside the shell, no weeds be left in the cotton fields, branches should not conceal cotton, and no cotton should be dropped on the ground." After the meeting, communes organized professional cotton-picking teams of more than 40,000 people to carry out meticulous harvesting in a timely manner. Rudong County's Juedong area recently mobilized 10,000 people to rush to pick 400,000 jin of cotton before the rain, preventing the cotton floss from being rained on. While harvesting cotton in a timely manner, various places have also strengthened the later-stage management of cotton fields, making autumn bolls plump and fluffing early, truly achieving "icing on the cake." The Nantong Prefectural Leadership recently held an on-site meeting on the later-stage management of cotton fields in Qidong County, and the counties within the prefecture launched a vigorous overproduction competition centered on disaster prevention and resistance and later-stage processing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 27th: Inner Mongolia has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of oil crops. Now, commune members in various places are harvesting and threshing tensely. According to estimates based on actual harvesting and measurement in various places, the yield per mu of oil crops in the entire autonomous region this year may increase by more than 10% compared to last year. Due to the expansion of the planting area, the total output will increase by more than 50% compared to last year.

The unprecedented bumper harvest of oil crops in the autonomous region this year is a great victory for farmers of all ethnic groups in implementing the production policy of combining self-sufficient production and commodity production, and the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." In order to increase oil production, people's communes in various places have fully utilized the advantages of the commune's large scale, large land area, and convenient overall planning, and planted according to local conditions, rationally arranged the land for planting oil crops, and made full use of saline-alkali land and white land to expand the planting of sunflowers and castor beans. This year, the autonomous region sowed more than 6.8 million mu of various oil crops, an increase of 37% compared to 1958, exceeding the highest level in history. The proportion of oil crops in the total sown area has also increased from 6.8% in 1958 to 9.9%.

In order to achieve a "double leap forward in grain and oil," this year various places have basically changed the past extensive cultivation habit of not fertilizing oil crops, and have also conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." More than 80% of the oil crop land in the region has been plowed, more than half of the land has been fertilized, the fertilized area has more than doubled compared to last year, and close planting has been carried out according to local conditions to increase the number of seedlings retained. Zhelimumeng, the main castor bean producing area in the country, planted castor beans earlier and better this year than in previous years, completing the sowing work in early April, and basically planting them on land suitable for castor bean growth, of which about 50% had undergone autumn plowing, and the fertilized area reached about 75%.

Now, the enthusiasm of the commune members of all ethnic groups is high, and more than 100,000 laborers are fighting day and night, rushing to harvest oil crops, striving to harvest cleanly and completely, without losing a single grain, and achieving a bumper harvest.

    公社力量大  南北喜丰收
    河北福建广东开镰收割丰产粮食
    山西江苏棉区社员加紧采摘新棉
    内蒙古十万大军正抢收油料作物
    据新华社天津27日电　河北省的秋收工作已普遍展开，五百万雄兵挥镰上阵，喜收丰产粮，到9月15日，全省已收割春谷子、玉米、高粱、莜麦等早秋作物二千五百多万亩，占早秋作物的55％。根据已经实打实收的情况，可以看出今年各种作物一般都比往年增产一、二成，而且都高于原计划的产量指标。
    开镰以来，各地出现了很多大面积丰产田。永年县十一万亩春谷获得空前丰收，平均亩产三百六十斤，比大跃进的去年提高二成，其中有五万亩亩产五百斤以上，并出现了千斤以上的高额丰产田二十四亩。中共唐山市委书记处书记周振华同志和秦皇岛东风公社合种的一百一十三亩高粱丰产方，亩产一千零二十多斤。乐亭县城关公社城关大队四百零三亩多穗高粱，平均每亩实产八百一十三斤，其中有四十三亩试验田，亩产一千零七十斤。
    粮食作物的大丰收，再次显示了人民公社战胜自然灾害的无比旺盛的生命力。今年春播期间，全省普遍缺雨，各地人民公社组织起九百多万人的抗旱播种大军坚持了三个月的抗旱运动，打了六万眼机井，新修和修补了十一万多条渠道，扩大了灌溉面积七百六十多万亩。并采用日夜鏖战，歇人不歇井，随浇随播种等办法，使一千多万亩失墒的土地适时播上了种。入夏以后，虽然有些地区又发生了涝灾，但是在公社统一领导下，立即组织起十八万人的排涝大军，统一规划、统一行动，克服了上下游之间的矛盾，使重灾减轻，大灾化小，轻灾不减产。特别是岗南、黄壁庄、王快、西大洋、横山岭和密云六大水库第一期工程的提前完工，在汛期起到了拦洪作用，基本上控制了潮白河、唐河、滹沱河、潴龙河的流量、保证了下游广大平原的大秋作物免受水害。
    粮食作物的大丰收，大大鼓舞了全省农民的劳动热情。在收割中，全省各地普遍开展了群众性的“六好”（割好、打好、收好、交售好、分配好、保管好）竞赛运动。各地还合理地安排了劳动力，推行了责任验收制度，按照收割工序建立起割、拉、打、拾等不同的专业队，实行流水作业法，作到适时收割，随收随割，随割随运随打随入仓，地里随割随拾，不丢棵，不丢穗；到场上薄摊匀晒，多轧细扬。通过这些办法，全省到现在估计共多收一千多万斤粮食。
    据新华社福州27日电　福建中稻，由北向南陆续黄熟，早熟地区正在抢收，大面积丰产喜讯不断传出。武夷山区光泽县华桥公社长广窠生产队，一百二十五亩中稻平均亩产六百九十四斤，比去年增产将近七成。
    由于气候季节的关系，福建省一百七十多万亩中稻都种在广大山区。中稻田一般都比较贫瘠；山区地多人少，中稻插秧期间，正值早稻田间管理和准备种植单季晚稻的大忙季节，由于劳力不足，过去中稻耕作一向比较粗放，产量较低。但是，今年因为有了人民公社，这种状况完全改变了。各公社和生产大队，都合理安排劳力，派出远耕队、耕山队等，对贫瘠的中稻田进行了深耕，增施了肥料，改进了水利条件，种植和田间管理也搞得及时精细，因而获得了全面丰收。建阳县水吉公社为了改变人们轻视中稻的思想，全社一百二十个生产队长以上的干部，和社员一起种植了六百多亩中稻试验田、丰产田。这些田成了“指挥田”，推动了全社中稻田的精耕细作，中稻普告丰收。各地人民公社社员，在中稻大丰收的鼓舞下，都兴致勃勃地大闹晚秋超产运动，力争“晚稻超中稻，全面大丰收”。
    新华社广州27日电　广东省各地中稻已经黄熟，呈现一片丰收景象。收割较早的海南岛和粤北韶关地区，不断传来丰收喜讯。海南岛崖县椰林公社华北大队已收割的六百二十四亩，平均亩产比去年增产一成多。粤北乐昌县九峰人民公社联安大队九峰桥生产队已收割的四亩中稻，平均亩产比去年增产一倍左右。
    广东中稻一向种植面积不多，今年共种植中稻一百五十六万亩。这些中稻田大都是海边田和山坑田，过去由于土质和水利条件较差，加上耕作粗糙，所以产量不高。去年公社化以后，全面贯彻农业八字宪法，特别是改善了水利条件，并实行深翻、改良土壤和适当密植，因而中稻普遍生长良好。在田间管理中，又改变了过去只种不管的习惯，实行多耘田、多施肥和合理排灌。因此，今年尽管自然灾害特别多，但仍然普遍获得了丰收。
    据新华社太原27日电　山西省四百五十多万亩棉花普遍呈现丰收景象。各地人民公社社员，正在加紧采摘和出售新棉，迎接建国十周年。到目前止，仅晋东南专区已收购新棉（皮棉）七百多万斤。山西省主要纺织厂已经开始使用新棉生产。
    从各地棉花生长和收获情况看，虽然晋南、晋东南等主要产棉区遭受了为期比较长的旱灾，但是由于人民公社发挥了巨大威力，战胜了干旱，今年棉花仍然是个大丰收的趋势。翼城县和侯马市郊最近经过大检查，群众公认今年的棉花比以往任何一年都好。据初摘和测产的结果，一般都将比去年增产一成多。去年获得大面积丰产的临汾县邓庄公社邓庄管理区，一千一百多亩旱地棉田按照采摘情况计算，今年每亩可比去年增产十斤。
    据新华社南京26日电　江苏省七百多万亩棉花，银絮朵朵，结桃累累，到处一片丰收景象。棉区社员们正在加紧采摘新棉，决心用保证丰产丰收的实际行动，迎接建国十周年。主要产棉区东台县，经过社员们精心采摘，现在已收新棉一千二百万斤，比去年同期增加五倍。
    江苏棉区在棉花结铃时期，气温高，日照足，落铃率一般比去年减少了一半，伏桃结得特别多；早期棉桃成熟时期，也比往年缩短了十多天，在8月上旬就裂嘴吐絮。公社社员们看到桃多花好，愉快地歌颂说：“桃大如蛋，絮白似银，花涌如潮，人看花欢，花对人笑”。
    各产棉区都采取了有效措施来保证丰产丰收。中共泗阳县委在9月初召开了收棉现场会议，要求做到“壳内无棉，棉田无草，枝不招棉，地不掉棉”。会后，各公社组织了四万多人的收花专业队，及时进行细收细摘。如东县掘东片最近在雨前出动一万人突击拾花四十万斤，防止了棉絮遭受雨淋。在及时收花的同时，各地还加强了棉田后期管理，使秋桃肥大，及早吐絮，真正做到“锦上添花”。南通专区领导机关最近在启东县召开了棉田后期管理现场会议，全专区县与县之间以防灾抗灾和后期加工为中心，展开了轰轰烈烈的超产竞赛。
    据新华社呼和浩特27日电　内蒙古油料作物空前大丰收。现在，各地人民公社社员正在紧张收打。根据各地实收测打估算，今年全自治区油料作物每亩产量可比去年增产一成以上，由于种植面积的扩大，总产量将比去年增产五成多。
    今年自治区油料作物空前丰收，是各族农民贯彻执行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的生产方针和农业“八字宪法”的伟大胜利。各地人民公社为了增产油料，充分发挥了公社规模大，土地多，便于统筹规划，因地种植的优越性，合理安排了种油料的土地，充分利用盐碱地、白土地扩种了向日葵和蓖麻。今年自治区播种各种油料作物六百八十多万亩，比1958年增加了37％，超过了历史上最高水平。油料作物占总播种面积的比重也由1958年的6.8％，提高为9.9％。
    为了实现“粮油双跃进”，今年各地基本上改变了过去种油料不施肥的粗放耕作习惯，并且认真地贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”。全区80％以上的油料地都耕过，有一半以上土地施了肥，施肥面积比去年增加一倍以上，并且因地制宜地进行了密植，增加了留苗株数。全国的蓖麻主要产区哲里木盟，今年蓖麻比往年普遍种的早、种的好，4月上旬就完成了播种工作，并且基本上都种在适合蓖麻生长的土地上，其中50％左右进行过秋耕，施肥面积达到75％左右。
    现在，各族社员热情高涨，十多万劳动大军，正日夜奋战，抢收油料，力争收净、拉净，颗粒不丢，做到丰产丰收。
