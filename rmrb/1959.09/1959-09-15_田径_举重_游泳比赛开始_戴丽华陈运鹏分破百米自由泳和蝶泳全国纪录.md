    据新华社14日讯　第一届全国运动会田径比赛进入第二天。在14日举行的男子链球决赛中，北京选手张宴凯出人意料地战胜了全国纪录保持者毕鸿福，取得了全国冠军的称号，成绩是五十一米六六。四川选手刘兴玉以五米七九的成绩，取得了女子跳远决赛的第一名。
    由于天气阴凉，再加上在举行最后一项男子百米次赛时下起大雨，使这项比赛进行了两组（共四组，每组八人）。在第二组中，湖北选手李必华的成绩达到了十秒七，这是参加百米预赛和次赛的选手中成绩最好的一个。在七十六名参加百米比赛的选手中，北京的刘敬仁、四川的陈家全、上海的尤芳棣预赛时成绩都是十秒九，广东黄巧叔次赛时成绩也达到了十秒九。预料15日下午在举行这个项目的复赛和决赛时，将出现激烈的争夺场面。
    男子链球决赛前八名的名次如下：张宴凯（北京），五十一米六六；胡景全（解放军），五十一米三一；毕鸿福（山东），五十米七六；贺永宪（解放军），五十米七二；孙久远（山东），四十八米三六；徐汝林（北京），四十八米三一；朱家琪（山东），四十七米三○；那至升（解放军），四十六米八二。

　13日在北京工人体育场举行了田径比赛的“及格赛”。女子跳远共有五十八名选手参加，通过“及格赛”标准的有十六名选手。其中江西十七岁的选手萧浩萍出人意料地取得了同全国纪录保持者、四川的刘兴玉一样优良的成绩——五米六七。
    链球“及格赛”共三十八名选手参加，体重一百零八公斤的毕鸿福是脚伤一个月以后第一次参加正式比赛，但他第一次试扔时，就把七点二五七公斤重的链球扔到五十五米○四的地方，打破了他自己保持的五十二米七八的全国纪录。
  据新华社14日讯　第一届全运会最轻量级举重比赛今天晚上结束，著名运动员、广东的陈镜开以三百二十公斤的总成绩获得了冠军。
    陈镜开在挺举中曾三次冲击他本人去年在莱比锡创造的一百四十点五公斤的世界纪录，但是没有成功。
    全运会最轻量级的比赛共有二十五名选手参加，分三组在今天上午、下午和晚上举行。
    在今天晚上比赛结束后，举行了授奖仪式。
    新华社14日讯　第一届全国运动会最轻量级举重比赛前八名成绩如下：

    新华社14日讯　第一届全国运动会游泳比赛，今天在北京体育馆游泳馆举行预赛。上海选手戴丽华以一分八秒六的成绩创造了百米自由泳的全国最高成绩，并且成为我国第一个达到女子百米自由泳运动健将标准（一分九秒）的选手。蝶泳选手陈运鹏在预赛中，也以一分四秒的成绩，打破了男子百米蝶泳一分四秒三的全国纪录。
    今天共举行了七项不同距离的男、女自由泳、蛙泳、蝶泳、仰泳预赛，比赛中彼此争夺非常剧烈，一开场就形成了竞赛高潮。男子一百米蝶泳预赛有八名选手成绩都在运动健将标准（一分八秒）以内，其中名列第八的陈仁国（广东）的成绩是一分七秒一。男子一百米自由泳预赛也有六名选手的成绩在六十秒以内，其中广东林锦珠成绩最好，是五十七秒五。这种成绩十分接近的情况的出现，预料将使以后的比赛争夺更趋激烈。
    著名的蛙泳健将穆祥雄、戚烈云、曾英逸、莫国雄、杨兆忠今天在一个组里参加男子百米蛙泳预赛，结果穆祥雄用一分十一秒八的时间首先游到终点，这个成绩比他不久前创造的世界新纪录只差半秒。
