　　Every year during the fifth and sixth months of the lunar calendar, when the corn in the countryside is growing vigorously, the mountains in the Lueyang area of southern Shaanxi Province are filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, and resounding songs. At this time, the farmers in the Lueyang area are weeding the corn for the second time, but their method of weeding in the cornfields is different from that in other areas. They use a form of singing and weeding to guide and encourage the weeding. The farmers here call it "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed."

　　It is said that the form of "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" to weed the corn for the second time in the Lueyang area has been passed down for a long time, and this form appeared as early as the Ming Dynasty; by the late Qing Dynasty, "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" was more prevalent. Before liberation, this unique and beautiful form of farmer labor was gradually submerged. It was not until after liberation that "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" was gradually restored in the Lueyang area, and the scale became larger and larger. Since the rural people's communes, collective farming has become the main mode of production, and this traditional folk labor form of "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" has been unprecedentedly developed and prospered.

　　When "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed," the farmers often set up their formation, forming a long line like a snake. Each end has a "commander" in charge of advancing and retreating. Beside the "commander," there is also a person serving as the "second-in-command" to assist the "commander." In addition, there are two farmers who sing and beat the gongs and drums. Because there are many people, and the team is very long, it is difficult for the "commander" to fully understand the situation and direct the weeding team to advance, retreat, move left, and move right. At this time, the "commander" mainly listens to the content sung by the farmers beating the gongs and drums to understand the formation in order to determine the next direction of weeding. Therefore, the two people beating the gongs and drums actually act as the commander-in-chief, directing the three armies through the lyrics.

　　The content sung during "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" is sometimes pre-composed, and sometimes it is composed impromptu based on the specific situation of weeding at that time. The pre-composed content includes narratives of folk tales and myths; songs praising the happy life and construction achievements after liberation; promotions of advanced deeds of local model figures; and stories about the farming methods and agricultural characteristics of the area. The content that is composed impromptu includes commands for weeding; encouragement of production enthusiasm; praise of outstanding people in weeding; and criticism of backward phenomena in weeding. Therefore, through the coordination of these lyrics, farmers not only have appropriate recreational forms to coordinate and regulate the tense production activities during weeding, but also can use these lyrics to promote production and encourage the production enthusiasm of every farmer during labor. Especially under the scorching sun, when farmers feel tired from working all day, the farmers "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" will beat the gongs and drums loudly and speed up the lyrics, forming a tense combat atmosphere, which greatly invigorates some farmers, sweeps away the feeling of fatigue, and smoothly completes the weeding tasks of each plot of land ahead of schedule.

　　Because this traditional folk weeding form of "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" can play a role in stimulating production and promoting production, the local Party and government departments have attached great importance to this weeding method since liberation. In addition to vigorously encouraging the use of this method to weed and carry out large-scale "operations," they have also continuously organized forces to add new content to "Beating the Gong and Drum to Weed" and equip it with new lyrics, so that this form can better and more directly serve production.

    打锣鼓草

    每年农历五、六月间，农村中正当玉米茁壮地成长起来的时候，在陕西南部略阳地区一带的山岭上，到处锣鼓喧天，歌声嘹亮。这时候略阳地区的农民正在锄玉米的二道草，但是他们在玉米地里锄草的方法却与别的地区不一样。他们采用一种边歌边锄的形式来指导、鼓动锄草，这里的农民称之为“打锣鼓草”。
    略阳地区以“打锣鼓草”的形式来锄玉米二道草，据说传来已久，在明朝时代已有这种形式出现；至清朝后期，“打锣鼓草”较为盛行。在解放前，这种独特的优美的农民劳动方式被渐渐的淹没下去，直至解放后，“打锣鼓草”才在略阳地区逐渐恢复，并且规模愈来愈大。自从农村人民公社化以后，集体耕作成为生产的主要方式，这种民间的传统的劳动形式“打锣鼓草”才得到了空前的发展与繁荣。
    在“打锣鼓草”时，农民们往往摆开阵势，排成一字长蛇阵，两端各有“帅官”掌握前进后退，在“帅官”边上还有一人担任“二把手”，辅助“帅官”掌帅；另外有农民二人边唱边打锣鼓。由于人多，队伍排得长长的，“帅官”很难了解全面来指挥锄草队伍前进后退，往左移右，这时“帅官”主要听打锣鼓的农民所唱的内容来了解阵势，以决定下一步锄草前进的方向。所以打锣鼓的二人实际上起着总司令的作用，通过唱词来指挥三军。
    “打锣鼓草”时所唱的内容，有些是事先编就的，也有一些则是根据当时锄草的具体情况，临时随机应变地编出的。属于前一种即事先编就的内容，有叙述民间传说，神话故事的；有歌颂解放后的幸福生活，建设成就的；有推广当地模范人物先进事迹的；也有讲述这一地区耕作方式与农业特点的。属于后一种即临时编就唱出的，有指挥锄草进行的；有激励生产热情的；有表扬锄草中的优秀人物的；也有批评锄草中的落后现象的。所以，通过这些唱词的配合，使农民在锄草中既有了适当的文娱形式来配合调剂紧张的生产活动，同时又可以利用这些唱词来推动生产，鼓动每一个农民在劳动时的生产积极性。特别是在烈日下，当农民由于整日劳动而感觉疲劳时，“打锣鼓草”的农民就紧打锣鼓，加快唱词，形成一种紧张的战斗气氛，使一些农民精神大为振作，疲劳感觉一扫而光，顺利地提前完成每一地块的锄草任务。
    由于“打锣鼓草”这种民间的传统的锄草形式能起刺激生产、促进生产的作用，所以在解放后，当地党政部门对这种锄草方式极其重视，除大力鼓励采用这种方式来锄 草与进行大面积“作战”外，还不断的组织力量来为“打锣鼓草”增加新内容，配以新的唱词，使得这种形式能更好的、更直接的来为生产服务。
