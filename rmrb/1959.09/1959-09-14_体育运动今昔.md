Sports Then and Now
    Fang Huisheng

    The First National Games is an unprecedentedly grand sports event in China's history.

    Before liberation, old China held seven so-called "National Games." The first was held in October 1910 (the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty). Only over 140 athletes participated, and there were only three competition events. Later, National Games were held in 1914, 1924, 1930, 1933, 1935, and 1948. The total number of participants in the seven games was less than 10,000, the number of competition events in each game did not exceed seven, and the duration of each game was no more than ten days.

    Now, the scale of the First National Games of New China is unprecedented. More than 10,000 athletes are participating in this Games, which is equivalent to the total number of athletes in the seven Games before liberation. There are 42 competition and performance events, which is several times more than the "Games" before liberation.

    In old China, sports were merely an embellishment, and only a few people participated. The gates of the sports field were closed to the broad masses of working people. It was even more difficult to see athletes from ethnic minorities. However, the current First National Games has the participation of 27 ethnic groups, with more than 3,600 female athletes alone, exceeding the total number of athletes in the 1948 Games before liberation by 80%.

    The First National Games will be held at an unprecedentedly high level of sports in our country. For example, in the days before the opening of the Games, Jiang Yumin, a representative from Zhejiang Province, achieved a 100-meter time of 11.6 seconds, which has already surpassed the American women's 100-meter time in this year's U.S.-Soviet track and field competition. In the National Games rowing competition held in East Lake, Wuchang, the results of three events and twenty-one teams surpassed those of the American and Italian teams who were champions at the 16th Olympic Games. On August 30, Mu Xiangxiong set a new world record of 1 minute 11.3 seconds in the 100-meter breaststroke. These were all unimaginable before liberation.

    According to statistics, in the two months before the start of the First National Games, more than 30 people broke 21 national track and field records more than 50 times. In the 7th "Games" in 1948 before liberation, only seven national track and field records were broken in total. At that time, most of the national records were only equivalent to the level of a second-class athlete today, and some even did not meet the minimum standards for graded athletes.

    For example, in track and field, the national records before liberation for men's 800 meters (2 minutes 2.2 seconds), 1500 meters (4 minutes 11.1 seconds), 5000 meters (16 minutes 0.8 seconds), 10,000 meters (32 minutes 47 seconds), 200-meter low hurdles (26.4 seconds), 400-meter intermediate hurdles (57.9 seconds), shot put (13.26 meters), javelin (53.85 meters), pentathlon (2269 points), decathlon (4348 points), and women's 100 meters (12.2 seconds) were only equivalent to the level of second-class athletes today. The pre-liberation men's 3000 meters (9 minutes 57.3 seconds), women's 200 meters (27.5 seconds), high jump (1.40 meters), and long jump (5.06 meters) even only reached the level of third-class athletes today.

    In swimming, the pre-liberation men's 400-meter freestyle (5 minutes 33.2 seconds), 1500-meter freestyle (22 minutes 59.2 seconds), women's 100-meter freestyle (1 minute 20.6 seconds), and 400-meter freestyle (7 minutes 16.5 seconds) only reached the second-class athlete standard today. The 200-meter breaststroke (3 minutes 58.3 seconds) only reached the third-class athlete level. Yang Xiuqiong, a well-known female swimmer before liberation, according to her record of 1 minute 37.4 seconds in the 100-meter backstroke, would not even reach the second-class athlete standard today (1 minute 37 seconds).

    In weightlifting, the pre-liberation lightweight total (270 kg) as well as the lightweight snatch (105 kg), middleweight snatch (87.5 kg), middleweight clean and jerk (115 kg), light heavyweight press (80 kg), and heavyweight snatch (95 kg) also only reached the second-class athlete level today. At that time, the national record for the light heavyweight total (300 kg) was not even as high as the current record for the lightest weight class (332.5 kg).

    Some of the men's records from the 1948 "National Games" before liberation were even worse than the current women's scores. For example, the current women's 400-meter freestyle has reached 5 minutes 32.7 seconds, while the highest score in the men's 400-meter freestyle final at that Games was 5 minutes 44.6 seconds.

    With the great improvement in sports level, the standards for the First National Games have also been greatly raised. For example, the qualifying standard for the men's high jump at this Games is 1.90 meters, while the national record before liberation was only 1.87 meters. At this Games, women had to cross 1.52 meters to participate in the high jump preliminary. The old Chinese women's high jump record was only about 1.40 meters, which is only equivalent to today's second-class athlete standard. If Zheng Fengrong had participated in the men's high jump competition at the old Chinese 7th "Games," her score would have ranked in the top three.

    The newly built, largest Workers' Stadium in China, the main competition venue for the First National Games in Beijing, is huge in scale, beautiful in architecture, and well-equipped, creating modern, convenient, and comfortable conditions for spectators, athletes, and staff. It vividly reflects the Party and the government's concern for sports. The only slightly scaled Shanghai Jiangwan Stadium before liberation was blown up because it was occupied by the Kuomintang reactionary army as an ammunition depot. Chiang Kai-shek held the 7th "National Games" there to embellish "peace and prosperity." The organizers only cared about making money for themselves, and the sports field was dilapidated, with some commercial advertisements used to cover up the shame. The inside of the grandstand railings was made of earth bricks, which were not very strong. Coupled with the chaotic order, there were three incidents of fence collapses, injuring many people.

    In particular, from the experiences of some athletes, we can see the earth-shaking differences between the old and new societies. For example, Rong Guotuan, who won the World Table Tennis Men's Singles Championship, had once suffered from lung disease. Thanks to the Party and the government's meticulous care, he was treated and recuperated, which quickly cured him and strengthened his body. He won honor for the motherland in world competitions. During the Kuomintang rule, Guan Youwen, a famous long-distance runner in Shanghai, contracted lung disease and was unable to receive treatment due to poverty. The reactionary government ignored him, but forced him to participate in the competition when the Games were held.

    体育运动今昔
    方辉盛
    第一届全国运动会是我国历史上空前盛大的一次运动会。
    在解放以前，旧中国曾举行过七次所谓“全国运动会”。第一届是在1910年（清宣统二年）10月举行的，参加的运动员只有一百四十多人，比赛项目不过三项。以后在1914年、1924年、1930年、1933年、1935年、1948年都举行过全国运动会。前后七届运动会参加者总共不到万人，每届竞赛项目不超过七项，每次举行时间最多不过十天。
    现在新中国第一届全国运动会，规模是空前的。参加这次运动会的运动员达一万多人，相当于解放前七届运动会运动员人数的总和。比赛和表演项目有四十二项，比解放前的“运动会”多好几倍。
    在旧中国，体育运动只是一种点缀，只有少数人参加。运动场的大门对广大劳动人民是关闭的。少数民族的运动员更是很难看到。而今天的首届全运会却有二十七个民族参加，单是女运动员就有三千六百多人，超过了解放前1948年运动会运动员总人数的80％。
    第一届全国运动会将在我国体育运动空前高的水平上进行。例如，在运动会开幕前的几天里，浙江省代表姜玉民创造的百米成绩达十一秒六，已经超过了今年苏美田径赛中美国女子百米成绩。在武昌东湖举行的全运会赛艇比赛中，有三项、二十一个队次的成绩超过了第十六届奥运会冠军美国队和意大利队。8月30日，穆祥雄创造了百米蛙泳一分十一秒三的世界最新成绩。这些都是解放前不可想像的。
    据统计，在第一届全国运动会开始前两个月里，已经有三十多人、五十多次打破了二十一项田径全国纪录，而在解放前1948年的第七届“运动会”田径赛总共只打破了七项全国纪录。而当时的全国纪录，大部分只抵得上现在二级运动员水平，有的甚至连等级运动员的起码标准都达不到。
    例如，在田径方面，解放前全国纪录男子八百米（二分二秒二）、一千五百米（四分十一秒一）、五千米（十六分零秒八）、一万米（三十二分四十七秒）、二百米低栏（二十六秒四）、四百米中栏（五十七秒九）、铅球（十三米二十六）、标枪（五十三米八十五）、五项运动（二千二百六十九分）、十项运动（四千三百四十八分）、女子一百米（十二秒二）等，都只相当于现在二级运动员的水平。而解放前男子三千米（九分五十七秒三）、女子二百米（二十七秒五）、跳高（一米四十）、跳远（五米零六）等甚至只达到现在的三级运动员水平。
    游泳方面，解放前男子四百米自由泳（五分三十三秒二）、一千五百米自由泳（二十二分五十九秒二）、女子一百米自由泳（一分二十秒六）、四百米自由泳（七分十六秒五）等都只达到现在二级运动员标准。二百米蛙泳（三分五十八秒三）只达到三级运动员水平。解放前闻名一时的女子游泳选手杨秀琼，根据她保持的一百米仰泳（一分三十七秒四）的纪录看，现在还达不到二级运动员标准（一分三十七秒）。
    举重方面，解放前轻量级总成绩（二百七十公斤）以及轻量级双手挺举（一百零五公斤）、中量级双手抓举（八十七点五公斤）、中量级双手挺举（一百一十五公斤）、轻重量级双手推举（八十公斤）、重量级双手抓举（九十五公斤）等，也只达到现在二级运动员水平。那时候，次重量级总成绩（三百公斤）的全国纪录还没有现在的最轻量级的纪录（三百三十二点五公斤）高。
    解放前1948年“全运会”的一些男子纪录，甚至比现在的女子的成绩都不如。例如，现在的女子四百米自由泳已经达到了五分三十二秒七，而那一届男子四百米自由泳决赛最高成绩是五分四十四秒六。
    在体育水平大大提高的情况下，第一届全运会的标准也大大提高了。例如，这届运动会男子跳高及格赛的标准是一米九十，而解放前的全国纪录却只有一米八七。在这次运动会上，女子要跨过了一米五二，才能参加跳高预赛。而旧中国女子跳高纪录仅有一米四十左右，只等于今天二级运动员的标准。如果郑凤荣参加旧中国第七届“运动会”男子跳高比赛，她的成绩也能占居前三名。
    第一届全国运动会主要比赛场地的北京新建成的全国最大的工人体育场，规模巨大，建筑美观，设备完善，为观众、运动员和工作人员创造了现代化的便利舒适条件。它形象地体现了党和政府对体育运动的关怀。而在解放前唯一略具规模的上海江湾体育场，因为被国民党反动军队据为火药库而被炸毁。蒋介石为了点缀“升平”在那里举行第七届“全国运动会”。而主持者只顾赚钱中饱，运动场破破烂烂，弄一些商业广告遮羞。看台栏杆内部用土砖堆成，很不牢实，加以秩序紊乱，发生了三处围栏倒塌事件，伤人不少。
    特别是从一些运动员的遭遇，可以看出新旧社会的天壤之别。例如，荣获世界乒乓球男子单打冠军的容国团，过去曾一度患肺病，由于党和政府无微不至的关怀，经医治疗养，使他很快病愈体强，在世界比赛中，为祖国争得荣誉。而在国民党统治时期，上海著名长跑运动员管友文，染肺病因家贫无力医治，反动政府置之不顾，可是召开运动会时，却硬逼他参加比赛。
