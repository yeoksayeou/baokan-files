Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th: Sichuan Province is reporting frequent good news about the large-scale harvest of 15 million mu of corn. Currently, 60% of the province's corn has been harvested, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. Nanchong Prefecture's 200,000 mu of early corn yielded more than 20% more than last year. Xuanhan County's 40,000 mu of corn averaged 1,025 jin per mu, an increase of 170.8% over last year; of which 19,887 mu averaged more than 1,500 jin per mu. Fengdu County's 70,000 mu of corn and Guang'an County's 50,000 mu of early corn both averaged over 1,000 jin per mu. Jiangbei County, which suffered more severe disasters, also achieved a high yield of 713 jin per mu on its 140,000 mu of corn, an increase of more than 20% over last year.

The comprehensive implementation of the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture, especially the promotion of directional close planting, has led to a general and rational increase in the density of corn planting, greatly promoting the increase in yield. Xuanhan County, where the Shangxia People's Commune, which pioneered directional close planting, is located, used to have about 3,000 corn plants per mu, but this year it generally reached about 6,000 plants. The 1,500 mu of corn in the Shangxia Commune averaged 1,616 jin per mu, a three-fold increase over last year.

The corn harvest in Sichuan Province is a major victory for the province's farmers in their struggle against various disasters. Jiangbei County, located in the hilly area, encountered severe drought at the crucial moment when the corn was entering the tasseling and silking stages. The corn leaves curled up and withered, and the silks were scorched. Under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes throughout the county rose up to fight the drought and protect the seedlings, dispatching six to seven thousand people every day to carry water from the mountains to irrigate the fields day and night. Generally, they irrigated two to three times, and in severely drought-stricken areas, they irrigated as many as five times. Finally, they overcame the drought. In late May, a particularly large storm knocked down 110,000 mu of corn, of which more than 40,000 mu were seriously damaged. The county immediately mobilized 200,000 people to launch a vigorous campaign to prop up the fallen corn. Through methods such as building frames, banking up the roots, inserting poles, and pulling ropes, all the fallen corn was propped up within four or five days. Fengdu County's 70,000 mu of early corn suffered three consecutive rainstorms from the beginning of ear formation, and about one-third of the corn was blown down or broken. In the later stage of corn growth, it suffered extremely severe drought. However, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the county's farmers overcame wind and drought disasters time and again, and finally achieved a bumper harvest.

    四川玉米大面积丰收   
    南充专区二十万亩玉米比去年增产二成
    据新华社成都18日电　四川省一千五百万亩玉米大面积丰收捷报频传。目前全省玉米已有60％收打完毕，获得空前大丰收。南充专区二十万亩早玉米比去年增产两成多。宣汉县四万亩玉米平均亩产一千零二十五斤，比去年增产170.8％；其中平均亩产在一千五百斤以上的有一万九千八百八十七亩。丰都县七万亩玉米和广安县五万亩早玉米，都平均亩产在一千斤以上。受灾较严重的江北县十四万亩玉米也获得亩产七百一十三斤的高产，比去年增产两成多。
    全面贯彻八字宪法，特别是由于定向密植的推行，使玉米种植的密度普遍有了合理的增加，大大促进了产量的提高。创造定向密植的上峡人民公社所在的宣汉县，过去玉米每亩植株一般在三千株左右，今年普遍达到了六千株左右。上峡公社的一千五百多亩玉米平均亩产一千六百一十六斤，比去年增产三倍。
    四川省玉米丰收是全省农民向各种灾害作斗争的重大胜利。地处丘陵区的江北县，在玉米开喇叭口到出天花、授粉这两个关键时刻，都遭遇到严重的干旱，玉米叶子卷筒萎缩，须子枯焦。全县人民公社在党的领导下奋起抗旱保苗，每天出动六、七万人，日夜从山下挑水上山浇灌。一般浇灌二至三次，干旱严重的浇灌五次之多。最后战胜了旱灾。5月下旬有一次特大级风暴吹倒了十一万亩玉米，其中四万多亩严重受害，全县立即出动二十万人，展开了轰轰烈烈的扶倒运动。通过搭架、壅蔸、插竿、牵绳等办法，四、五天内，就把倒伏的玉米全部扶起。丰都县七万多亩早玉米从开始长包起，连续遭到三次暴风雨，三分之一左右的玉米被吹倒或吹断；在玉米生长后期又受到极重的旱灾。但全县农民在各级党委领导下，一次又一次地战胜了风灾、旱灾，终于取得了丰收。
