Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 31st: "Labor News" published an editorial on the 28th entitled "People's China is Advancing Irresistibly," the full text of which is as follows:

　　Yesterday (August 27th) we published news regarding the important meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In a very short time after this meeting, the State Council and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China accepted the conclusions made by the meeting. The leaders of the 650 million Chinese people summarized the actual situation regarding the enormous tasks put forward by the Chinese people to complete the Five-Year Plan from 1958 to 1962.

　　The conclusions made by the meeting are exciting, indicating that the Chinese people have all the prerequisites to complete the main tasks originally scheduled for 1962 this year. The Chinese people can produce steel, metallurgical and electrical equipment, machine tools, paper, cotton yarn, and other items three years ahead of schedule, reaching the levels originally planned for the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. This is truly a wonderful gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of China.

　　How were these achievements, which delight millions of friends of the Chinese people worldwide, obtained? This is the result of thoroughly implementing the general line of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the result of creatively applying the universally applicable principles of Marxism-Leninism in the specific context of China.

　　We all remember the famous Great Leap Forward in China in 1958, which astonished the world, and even the enemies who hate People's China the most could not deny it. Last year, the total value of China's industrial and agricultural output increased by 48%. Of course, 1958 was only the starting point for the enormous economic rise that is still continuing this year. In the first six months of this year, industrial production increased by 65% compared to the same period last year. The production of pig iron, coal, and machine tools has more than doubled. Although agriculture suffered major natural disasters—severe floods in the south and drought in the central region—both the yield per unit area and the total output are higher than last year's exceptionally good harvest. It is particularly gratifying that not only has the quantity of products increased, but the quality is also improving; and the people's communes, which have rapidly and comprehensively improved the lives of the rural people, are also being consolidated.

　　Of course, in a huge country with complex situations, it is difficult to formulate strict planned tasks, especially since this year's natural disasters disrupted plans in some areas. Therefore, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made suggestions, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, based on the recommendations of the State Council, adopted certain adjustments to the 1959 plan. Although these changes mean a reduction in some tasks, they will not hinder China's Great Leap Forward. According to the adjusted plan, Chinese industry will produce 50% more steel and 24% more coal than last year, and agriculture will increase grain and cotton production by 10%.

　　The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the current situation and put forward the tasks for future economic development, pointing out the paths and methods for completing these tasks.

　　The Chinese people want to complete these tasks, and existing experience convinces us that there should be no reason to doubt China's ability to complete them. The People's Republic of China can shorten the duration of the Five-Year Plan and shorten the slogan "catch up with Britain in major products within fifteen years" to ten years.

    人民中国势不可挡地前进着
    捷克斯洛伐克“劳动报”8月28日社论
    新华社布拉格31日电　“劳动报”28日发表了以“人民中国势不可挡地前进着”为题的社论，全文如下：
    昨天（8月27日）我们刊载了关于中共中央召开了重要会议的消息。在这次会议开过后的很短时期内，中华人民共和国国务院和人大常委会就接受了会议所做的结论。六亿五千万中国人民的领导人总结了中国人民完成1958年到1962年的五年计划所提出的巨大任务的实际情况。
    会议做出的总结是令人兴奋的，总结表明中国人民有一切前提在今年就完成原定在1962年完成的主要任务。中国人民能够提前三年生产出原计划在第二个五年计划末才能达到的那么多的钢、冶金和电机设备、机床、纸、棉纱和其它东西。这真是对中国十年大庆的美好献礼。
    这些使全世界千百万中国人民的朋友为之欢欣鼓舞的成就是如何取得的呢？这是彻底贯彻了中共中央总路线的结果，是在中国的具体情况下创造性地运用四海皆准的马克思列宁主义原则的结果。
    我们所有的人都记得全世界为之感到惊异的1958年中国著名的跃进，就是那些最仇恨人民中国的敌人也不能否认它。在去年，中国工农业产值总共提高了48％，当然1958年，这仅仅是今年还在继续着的经济上巨大上升的起点。在今年的前六个月，工业生产比去年同时期提高了65％。而生铁、煤和机床的生产提高了一倍以上。农业虽然遭到大的自然灾害——南部大水，中部干旱，但不论单位面积的产量或总产量都比去年特好的丰收还高。特别令人高兴的是产品不仅数量增长，质量也在提高；并且使得农村人民生活迅速地得到全面提高的人民公社也在巩固着。
    当然，在有着复杂情况的巨大国家里，制定严格的计划任务是很困难的，特别是今年的自然灾害打乱了某些地区的计划，所以中共中央全会提出了建议，人大常委会按国务院的建议通过了对1959年度的计划的某些调整。虽然这些变化意味着某些任务的降低，但决不妨碍中国的跃进。调整后的计划：中国工业将比去年多生产50％的钢，24％的煤，农业方面增产10％的粮食和棉花。
    中共中央全会对目前的情况作了总结并提出今后经济发展的任务，指出了完成这些任务的道路和方法。
    中国人民要完成这些任务，现有的经验使我们信服，对中国完成这些任务不应存在丝毫怀疑的理由。中华人民共和国能够缩短五年计划的年限，和缩短所提出的“十五年内在主要产品方面赶上英国”的口号为十年。
