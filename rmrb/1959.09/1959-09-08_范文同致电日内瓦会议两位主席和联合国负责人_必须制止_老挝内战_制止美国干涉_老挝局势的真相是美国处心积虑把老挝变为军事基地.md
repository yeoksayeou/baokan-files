    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, on the 6th, again reminding the two chairmen of the extremely serious situation in Laos and requesting the two chairmen to take measures to stop US interference in Laos and stop the Lao civil war. Pham Van Dong pointed out that the authority to resolve the current situation in Laos does not belong to the United Nations. All ways to restore and maintain peace in Laos must be based on the Geneva Agreement on Laos and the agreements signed between the Royal Government of Laos and the former Lao fighting forces. US imperialism must stop interfering in Laos, withdraw military personnel who have illegally entered Laos, and immediately restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos.

    The telegram said, "On August 26 this year, the US government once again decided to give the Phoui Sananikone government 'emergency military assistance' to expand the military strength of Laos and strengthen the training and equipment of the Lao Royal Army and security forces. According to the US Department of Defense, various US weapons and military equipment are being airlifted from US military bases in the Pacific to Laos."

    The telegram pointed out, "However, in order to shirk responsibility and deceive public opinion, US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government have greatly slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos' internal affairs. More seriously, Phoui Sananikone wrote to the UN Secretary-General on September 4, requesting the United Nations to send 'emergency forces' to Laos to stop the so-called 'aggression' by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

    The telegram continued, this trick of US imperialism and the Phoui Sananikone government "is to pave the way for US imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military aggression group to further interfere in Laos, turn Laos into a US military base, and prepare to launch a new war in Indochina." The telegram said, "This is a serious violation of the Geneva Agreement on Laos and the agreements signed between the Royal Government of Laos and the former Lao fighting forces, and a new step that seriously threatens the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: According to Vietnam News Agency today, Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, telegraphed the UN Secretary-General, the President of the UN General Assembly, and the President of the UN Security Council on the 6th, refuting the Lao Phoui Sananikone government's slander that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was interfering in Laos' internal affairs, as well as its illegal request that the United Nations immediately send "emergency forces" to Laos.

    The telegram pointed out that the deep-seated root cause and direct reason for the serious situation in Laos is the US attempt to turn Laos into a US military base and instigate the Sananikone government to provoke and continue to expand the civil war.

    The telegram said, "In order to realize the US conspiracy in Indochina, the Phoui Sananikone government has openly announced the abandonment of the Geneva Agreement on Laos, while betraying the agreement signed with the former Lao fighting forces, arresting the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front, including Prince Souphanouvong, and attempting to use force to eliminate the former Lao fighting forces, creating the civil war in Laos."

    The telegram pointed out that the above facts are the truth about the situation in Laos. These facts show that the United States and the Phoui Sananikone government have seriously and openly violated the Geneva Agreement on Laos and the guarantees they have made.

    The telegram said, "However, in order to deceive public opinion and shirk responsibility, the United States and the Sananikone government have continuously slandered the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in Laos and constantly distorted the facts. The current situation in Laos is precisely due to the United States and the Sananikone government, who are still continuing to expand the civil war in order to eliminate the former Lao fighting forces, and at the same time using this tense situation as an excuse for the United States to strengthen its military intervention in Laos."

    Regarding the way to resolve the current situation in Laos, Premier Pham Van Dong emphasized in the telegram, "The Geneva Agreement on Laos and the agreements signed between the Royal Government of Laos and the former Lao fighting forces in Vientiane must be respected and strictly implemented; the US government must immediately stop its interference in Laos and immediately withdraw its military personnel from Laos. The Phoui Sananikone government must stop the civil war and stop the policy of persecuting and discriminating against personnel of the former Lao fighting forces." The telegram also called for the immediate resumption of the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

    The telegram concluded, "For the sake of peace and security in Southeast Asian countries and the world, for the sake of realizing the lofty goals and purposes of the UN Charter, and for the sake of respecting international agreements, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the United Nations must refute the Phoui Sananikone government's slanderous arguments and reject its unreasonable demands."

    范文同致电日内瓦会议两位主席和联合国负责人
    必须制止  老挝内战　制止美国干涉
    老挝局势的真相是美国处心积虑把老挝变为军事基地
    据新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在6日打电报给1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席英国外交大臣劳埃德和苏联外交部长葛罗米柯，再次提醒两位主席注意老挝当前极端严重的局势，要求两位主席采取措施，制止美国对老挝的干涉和制止老挝的内战。范文同指出，解决老挝当前局势问题的权限并不属于联合国。恢复和维护老挝和平的一切办法必须以关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议作为基础。美帝国主义必须停止干涉老挝，撤走非法进入老挝的军事人员，立即恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。
    电报说，“今年8月26日，美国政府再一次决定给培·萨纳尼空政府‘紧急的军事援助’，以扩充老挝的军事力量，加强老挝王国军队和保安力量的训练和装备。根据美国国防部透露，美国的各种武器和军事装备正在从美国在太平洋的军事基地空运到老挝。”
    电报指出，“但是，为了推卸责任和欺骗舆论，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府却大肆诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政。更严重的是培·萨纳尼空在9月4日写信给联合国秘书长，要求联合国派遣‘紧急部队’到老挝以制止所谓越南民主共和国的‘侵略’。”
    电报接着指出，美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府的这种伎俩，“是为了给美帝国主义和东南亚条约军事侵略集团进一步干涉老挝、变老挝为美国的军事基地，为准备发动印度支那新战争铺平道路。”电报说，“这是严重地破坏了关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议、严重地威胁越南民主共和国的安全以及印度支那和东南亚的和平的新步骤。”
  据新华社河内7日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，越南民主共和国总理范文同在6日打电报给联合国秘书长、联合国大会主席和联合国安全理事会主席，驳斥老挝培·萨纳尼空政府关于越南民主共和国干涉老挝内政的诬蔑，以及它非法要求联合国立即派遣“紧急部队”到老挝。
    电报指出，造成老挝严重局势的深远根源和直接原因，是美国企图把老挝变为美国的军事基地，唆使萨纳尼空政府挑起并且继续扩大内战。
    电报说，“为了实现美国在印度支那的阴谋，培·萨纳尼空政府已经公然宣布废弃关于老挝的日内瓦协议，同时背弃了同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，逮捕了包括苏发努冯亲王在内的老挝爱国战线党领导人，图谋用武力消灭前寮国战斗部队，制造了老挝的内战。”
    电报指出，上述事实就是老挝局势的真相。这些事实表明，美国和培·萨纳尼空政府严重和露骨地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议以及他们所作的保证。
    电报说，“但是，为了欺骗舆论和推卸责任，美国和萨纳尼空政府却不断地诬蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝，不断地歪曲事实。当前的老挝局势正是由于美国和萨纳尼空政府造成的，他们还在继续扩大内战，以消灭前寮国战斗部队，同时以这种紧张局势为借口，好让美国加强对老挝的军事干涉。”
    关于解决老挝当前局势的途径，范文同总理在电报中强调指出，“必须尊重和严格履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府在万象同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议；美国政府必须立即停止对老挝的干涉，立即把他的军事人员从老挝撤走。培·萨纳尼空政府必须停止内战，停止迫害和歧视前寮国战斗部队人员的政策。”电报还要求立即恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动。
    电报最后说，“为了东南亚各国和全世界的和平和安全，为了实现联合国宪章的崇高宗旨和目的，为了必须尊重国际协议，越南民主共和国政府认为，联合国必须驳斥培·萨纳尼空政府的诬蔑论调，拒绝它的无理要求。”
