Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: In order to meet the needs of the development of higher education and continuously improve the teaching quality and scientific level of universities, qualified universities across the country will continue to recruit and train graduate students. This year, more than seventy universities are recruiting in many specialties of science, engineering, liberal arts, agriculture, medicine, teacher training, and physical education departments.
　　This year's graduate students are all recommended by relevant units. The conditions stipulate: politically reliable, ideologically progressive, and of upright character; professionally, graduates of university undergraduate programs, in-service cadres with two or three years of practical work experience in the selected major, or in-service cadres with equivalent junior college education, who have been engaged in practical work for many years and have rich experience, or outstanding graduates of university undergraduate programs; at the same time, healthy and able to persist in learning. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, in addition to political and professional review and health examination, they must also participate in examinations to prove that they have the potential for development before they can be admitted. The examination work is the responsibility of the recruiting schools, and the time is generally set in mid-October.
　　The main purpose of universities training graduate students is to cultivate "red and expert" personnel who have a systematic and solid theoretical foundation in their respective disciplines and are able to independently carry out teaching and scientific research work as university teachers. The study period is generally set at three years. In this process, graduate students will engage in political study, professional study, foreign language study, scientific research, and productive labor. Systematic professional theoretical study and scientific research work will account for a larger proportion of graduate students' individual study plans. Graduate students must also complete a scientific thesis of a certain quality upon graduation.
　　The relevant universities attach great importance to the work of recruiting and training graduate students. Most schools have selected teachers who are politically progressive, academically specialized, and have rich experience in teaching and scientific research to serve as supervisors. Some schools have also equipped full-time administrative cadres to strengthen the management of graduate student work.
