Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. In anticipation of the imminent opening of the First National Games, the seventy-seven competition venues, spanning water, land, and air across Beijing's eight competition zones, have been completely renovated, ready for over seven thousand heroes from all corners to compete. Sports equipment and gear for the National Games have also been continuously arriving in Beijing and distributed to various venues.

　　The newly built Beijing Workers' Stadium, the largest in our country, is preparing to host the grand opening ceremony of the National Games with its brand-new look. On the windbreak canopy of the central stadium, which can accommodate 80,000 spectators, are large slogan signs that read "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" and "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique." On the rostrum of the Xiannongtan Stadium, two national flags are hung, with the years 1949 and 1959 on either side. The football field here is covered in lush green grass, and workers completed the final trimming yesterday. Other competition venues in various competition zones have also been renovated and rebuilt in recent days, with new competition and practice fields added. The competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium has been freshly painted, and more than ten ping-pong tables have been set up in the practice hall, where players can engage in fierce battles simultaneously in groups. The original open-air basketball and volleyball practice fields south of the gymnasium have been converted into five tennis courts with excellent elasticity. In the western suburbs, a five-kilometer-long motorcycle racing road around Lao Mountain has been basically completed. This advanced asphalt road has various slopes and curves that meet international competition requirements. The Beijing Shooting Range, which meets international shooting competition standards, has also built two new clay pigeon shooting ranges.

　　To meet the needs of the vast audience, the Beijing Gymnasium practice hall, the Labor People's Culture Palace Stadium, the Shichahai Sports School Gymnasium, the East Chang'an Street Stadium, and other competition venues have been newly equipped with stands, adding many seats. A new wooden movable basketball court will be installed in the center of the newly built cycling track, which will become a standard illuminated basketball court that can accommodate 10,000 spectators. In the shade of the pine and cypress trees on the bank of the Houhe River in the Labor People's Culture Palace, a large chessboard more than three meters high hangs beside the trees, with each chess piece as large as a dish. Here, people can enjoy tea while admiring the superb chess skills of the players in the shade. The Guanyuan Stadium has been expanded from its original size, and workers are building blue brick stands in the rain. The brand-new targets are already standing on the field. Soon, the audience can sit comfortably in the stands and enjoy the archery competition of "shooting through the willow leaves from a hundred paces."

　　Various sports equipment and supplies needed for the thirty-six competition events have been continuously arriving in Beijing. Various balls transported from Shanghai, after careful inspection by the referees, have been fully inflated and distributed to various competition venues. In the Shichahai Sports School Gymnasium, the equipment for gymnastics competitions is all newly custom-made. The parallel bars made of Manchurian ash produced in Northeast China are hard and elastic, allowing athletes to perform various complex movements.

　　Currently, the final inspection and cleaning work is underway at various sports venues to make the venues cleaner and more beautiful, and to welcome the opening of the National Games.

    七十七个比赛场地披上新装
    新华社1日讯　第一届全国运动会的开幕日期日益迫近，北京八个竞赛区的水、陆、空七十七个比赛场地，已经布置得簇新，专等七千多名各路英雄来比武较量。供全运会用的体育器材和用具，也已源源运到北京，分发到各个场地。
    新建成的我国最大的体育场——北京工人体育场，正以它崭新的面貌迎接全运会开幕盛典的举行。能容纳八万观众的中心运动场的挡风棚沿上，装上了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”和“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的大标语牌。在先农坛体育场的主席台上，挂起了两面国旗，两旁各有1949和1959的字样。这里的足球场绿草如茵，工人昨天又作了最后一次修剪。各个竞赛区的其他竞赛场地，连日来也进行了修整和改建，并且增建了新的比赛场和练习场。北京体育馆比赛馆中，已经油饰一新，练习馆里设置了十多张乒乓球台，选手们在这里可以同时分组展开激战。体育馆南边原来的露天篮球、排球练习场，已经改建成为五个弹性很好的网球场。在西郊，一条环绕老山的五公里长的摩托车竞赛公路，已经基本建成。这条高级沥青路，有合乎国际比赛要求的多种坡度和弯道。适应国际射击比赛的北京射击场，也新建了两个飞鸽靶场。
    为了满足广大观众的需要，北京体育馆练习馆、劳动人民文化宫体育场、什刹海体育馆、东长安街体育场等比赛场地，都新安装了看台，增添了许多座位。一个新式木质活动篮球场，将装置在新建成的自行车赛车场的中央，这里将成为一个可容观众万人的标准灯光篮球场。在劳动人民文化宫后河畔的苍松翠柏林荫中，一个三米多高的大棋盘高挂树旁，每个棋子像菜盘子那样大。这儿，人们可以在林荫中一面品茗，一面欣赏棋手们高超的棋艺。官园体育场比原来扩大了，工人们冒雨修起青砖看台，崭新的箭靶已经屹立场上。不久，观众们就可以稳坐看台上，欣赏“百步穿杨”的射箭竞技。

    现在，各个运动场地正在进行最后的检查清理工作，要把场地打扫得更加整洁，装饰得更加美观，迎接全运会的开幕。
