    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th. The Korean "Democratic Youth Daily" published a commentary on August 30th regarding the communique of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, titled "The Great Victory of the Leaping Chinese People," stating: The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that the Chinese people will complete the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, "This is a great pride and miracle of the socialist era."

    The commentary said: "It is only possible under the socialist system to complete a five-year plan in two years; this is something unimaginable under the capitalist system."

    The commentary said: "The general line of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, for building socialism is the most correct and creative application of the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese reality. It has inspired the hearts of the Chinese people and has become a great material force." The Chinese people "will, as in the past, continue to exert their efforts, hold high the glorious banner of the Party's general line, and promote and consolidate the socialist cause of the motherland at a faster pace." "The achievements of the Chinese people will further consolidate the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and make a great contribution to strengthening peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people and youth regard every achievement of the Chinese people and youth as their own and are inspired by every victory of the Chinese people in socialist construction."

    The commentary pointed out that any slander and sabotage by the imperialists against China's Great Leap Forward can only burst like bubbles.

    The commentary said: "The friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, forged in blood, have been further consolidated through the achievements made today in the Chollima Movement and the Great Leap Forward Movement. The Chollima and the Great Leap Forward—these are symbols of the invincible nature and eternal friendship of the two peoples." "All the Korean people and youth wish the Chinese people new victories in the struggle to implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong."

    朝鲜“民主青年报”赞扬我国成就
    中国人民将更快跃进
    新华社平壤4日电　朝鲜“民主青年报”在8月30日就中共八届八中全会公报发表的题为“跃进中的中国人民的伟大胜利”的评论说：中共八届八中全会提出中国人民将提前三年完成第二个五年计划，“这是社会主义时代的很大的自豪和奇迹。”
    评论说：“只有在社会主义制度下才有可能以二年完成五年的计划，这是在资本主义制度下梦想不到的事情。”
    评论说：“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的关于建设社会主义的总路线，是把马克思列宁主义的普遍原理最正确地创造性运用到中国现实的产物，它鼓舞了中国人民的心，成了巨大的物质力量。”中国人民“今后将同过去一样，继续鼓起干劲，高举党的总路线的光辉旗帜，以更快的速度促进和巩固祖国的社会主义事业。”“中国人民的成就，将进一步巩固以苏联为首的团结起来的社会主义阵营的威力，对加强远东和世界和平作出巨大贡献。朝鲜人民和青年把中国人民和青年的每个成就都视为自己的成就，为中国人民在社会主义建设中的每个胜利所鼓舞”。
    评论指出，帝国主义者对中国大跃进的任何诬蔑和破坏都只能像水泡一样破灭。
    评论说：“以鲜血凝结成的朝中两国人民的友谊团结通过今天在千里马运动和大跃进运动中所取得的成就更加巩固了。千里马和大跃进——这是两国人民战无不胜的象征和永恒的友谊的象征。”“全体朝鲜人民和青年预祝中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下在为实现中共八届八中全会的决议的斗争中取得新的胜利。”
