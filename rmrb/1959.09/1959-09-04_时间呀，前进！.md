Time, forward!
    Steel flows,
    Machines roar,
    Tractors sing in the fields,
    The sound of axes and saws echoes from the forest,
    Convoys of ships shuttle back and forth on the river,
    The train of the times speeds by,
    The morning bell ticks rhythmically,
    Time, is moving forward!
    From Heilongjiang to Hainan Island,
    From the Kunlun Mountains to the shores of the East China Sea,
    Red flags flutter everywhere,
    Enthusiasm is soaring everywhere,
    The land is picturesque, heroes are like clouds,
    People are engaged in earth-shattering undertakings,
    Good news arrives one after another from all fronts,
    Yesterday's wilderness becomes today's new factories and villages,
    Cities and countryside advance hand in hand.
    Here, everything seems full of life,
    Iron trees bloom as a gift,
    Stubborn rocks nod and turn to gold,
    The people exert infinite strength and wisdom,
    People are changing everything,
    Changing their own souls.
    Like a joyful symphony being played,
    Six hundred million people with one direction and one heart.
    Like a large engine running non-stop,
    Everyone is an indispensable screw.
    Yesterday we climbed the steep mountains,
    Just as we won a victory, who isn't overjoyed?
    However, the future journey is still far away,
    There must be no slightest slackening or complacency.
    The Party is calling us,
    Raise the heaven-opening, earth-splitting heroic sword,
    Cross mountains, cross rivers,
    Use the key of happiness to open the gate of heaven!
    The drums of war are sounding thunderously,
    The eastern sky emits rays of light,
    The motherland is advancing in great strides,
    Welcoming the season of harvest!
    Welcoming the great October!
    Time is a priceless treasure, every second counts,
    The Yangtze River's waves push forward, flowing eastwards,
    Time, is moving forward!

    时间呀，前进！
    海稜
    钢水在奔流，
    机器在吼鸣，
    拖拉机在田里歌唱，
    森林里传来伐木的斧锯声，
    江上的船队来往穿梭不停，
    时代的列车在飞奔，
    晨钟在有节奏地滴答摆动，
    时间呀，在前进！
    从黑龙江到海南岛，
    从昆仑山到东海之滨，
    到处红旗飘飘，
    到处热气腾腾，
    江山如画，英雄如云，
    人们在做着惊天动地的事业，
    各条战线传来一个接连一个的喜讯，
    昨天的荒野今天出现工厂新村，
    城市和乡村手携手儿并进。
    在这里一切都显得富有生命，
    铁树开花献礼，
    顽石点头成金，
    人民发挥着无穷的力量和智慧，
    人们在改变着一切，
    改变着自己的灵魂。
    好像欢乐的交响曲在演奏，
    六亿人民一个方向一条心。
    好像一部大发动机运转不停，
    每个人都是少不了的螺丝钉。
    昨天我们攀登上峻岭，
    正如我们打了胜仗谁个不欢欣？
    然而未来的路程还遥远，
    决不能有半点儿懈怠和骄矜。
    党在召唤着我们，
    举起开天辟地的英雄宝剑，
    越过高山，越过大河，
    用幸福的钥匙去打开天门！
    战鼓在震天价响，
    东方的天空放出万道光芒，
    祖国在高歌猛进，
    迎接丰收的季节！
    迎接伟大的十月！
    时间是无价之宝，分秒必争，
    长江后浪推前浪，东流滚滚，
    时间呀，在前进！
