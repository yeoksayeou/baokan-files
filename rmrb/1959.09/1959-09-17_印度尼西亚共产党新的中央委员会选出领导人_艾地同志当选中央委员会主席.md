Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 15th: The newly elected Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) announced at a gathering on the evening of the 14th that, at the first meeting of the Central Committee, Aidit was elected Chairman of the Central Committee of the PKI, Lukman as First Vice-Chairman, and Njoto as Second Vice-Chairman.

The newly elected members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee are Aidit, Lukman, Njoto, Sakirman, and Sudisman. Jusuf Adjitorop and Jono were elected alternate members of the Political Bureau. Sudisman and Adjitorop, along with six others, were elected members of the Secretariat. At the gathering, the list of members of the Central Auditing Commission, headed by Soejono Pradigdo, and the list of members of the Central Supervisory Commission, headed by Peris Pardede, were also read.

At the gathering on the evening of the 14th, the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of seven countries—Bulgaria, Poland, Australia, Hungary, Germany, Italy, and Cuba—who were invited to attend the Sixth Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party, met with the delegates of the Congress and respectively read out the congratulatory letters from their Central Committees to the Congress. The representatives' speeches, full of the spirit of internationalist solidarity, were warmly welcomed by the delegates.

Aidit spoke at the meeting. He said that because of the participation of fraternal party delegations, the reactionaries' attempt to separate the Indonesian Communist Party from the international communist movement had been defeated. This shows that the international communist movement is clearly much stronger than the dollar, and that progressive forces are much stronger than reactionary forces.

The participation of representatives of foreign fraternal parties in the gathering on the evening of the 14th was with the consent of Army Chief of Staff Nasution. On the morning of the 14th, these representatives, accompanied by Aidit, visited Nasution.

    印度尼西亚共产党新的中央委员会选出领导人
    艾地同志当选中央委员会主席
    据新华社雅加达15日电　新当选的印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会在14日晚上举行的一个集会上宣布，在中央委员会的第一次会议上，艾地当选为印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席，鲁克曼为第一副主席，约多为第二副主席。
    新当选的中央委员会政治局委员是艾地、鲁克曼、约多、萨基尔曼和苏蒂斯曼。优素福·阿吉托罗普和约诺当选为政治局候补委员。苏蒂斯曼和阿吉托罗普等八人当选为书记处成员。在集会上还宣读了以苏约诺·普腊迪格多为首的中央检查委员会名单和以佩里斯·帕尔德德为首的中央监察委员会委员名单。
    在14日晚上的集会上，应邀参加印度尼西亚共产党第六次代表大会的保、波、澳、匈、德、意、古巴七个国家的共产党和工人党的代表同大会代表们会见，并分别宣读了他们的中央委员会给大会的贺信。代表们充满国际主义团结精神的讲话受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
    艾地在会上讲了话。他说，由于兄弟党代表团的参加，反动派企图使印度尼西亚共产党同国际共产主义运动分离的阴谋已经遭到失败。这表明：国际共产主义运动显然比美元强大得多，进步力量比反动力量强大得多。
    外国兄弟党的代表参加14日晚上的集会是得到陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安的同意的。14日上午，这些代表在艾地陪同下，拜访了纳苏蒂安。
