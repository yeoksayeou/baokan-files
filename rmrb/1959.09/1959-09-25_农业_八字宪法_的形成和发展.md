The agricultural "Eight-Character Charter" is the basic measure among the twelve measures to increase production listed in the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program.

During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the farmers' experience in increasing production and the experience in agricultural technology reform since liberation, and systematically put forward the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter." This is the product of the combination of the Party's leadership, mass experience, and scientific research.

In their long-term production labor, Chinese farmers have accumulated rich experience. "Children should be related by blood, and the land should be deeply plowed," "Deep plowing grows rice, shallow plowing grows chaff," "Fat pigs make strong seedlings, lean pigs make withered seedlings," "Plenty of manure and frequent watering, no need to ask anyone," "A strong mother makes a fat child, good seeds make strong seedlings," "Three parts planting, seven parts management, diligent people make the land fertile," and so on. Many such sayings can be found everywhere. These sayings have already put forward some basic experiences for promoting agricultural production increases, and there have been facts of obtaining high yields by using these experiences in the past. However, for a long time, for the vast number of farmers, these experiences were only intuitive, spontaneous, and scattered things. Many people knew to do this, but did not understand the reason why, "knowing what it is, but not knowing why it is."

Under the exploitation of the feudal land system, often the higher the yield, the heavier the rent and taxes, and the vast number of farmers had little interest and enthusiasm for improving farming methods. When people are exploited and oppressed to the point of being unable to breathe, they have no mind or strength to pay attention to production increase issues.

After liberation, the land reform was implemented, and the feudal exploitation system was abolished, the situation underwent fundamental changes, and farmers gained the possibility of developing production. Various places began to pay attention to summarizing and promoting farmers' advanced experiences to increase yields. Chen Yongkang's experience in high-yield rice, Qu Yaoli's experience in high-yield cotton, and Shi Anfu's experience in high-yield wheat have played a good role in promoting grain and cotton production increases nationwide. The experience and wisdom of the broad masses of farmers have been developed. The Party and the People's Government led farmers in building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, rational close planting, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, breeding cattle, increasing the repair of agricultural tools, and selecting improved varieties. In three years, the task of restoring agricultural production was completed, and grain and cotton production exceeded the highest levels before liberation. However, the individual small-scale peasant economy was ultimately fragile, unable to withstand the attacks of natural disasters, and unable to carry out larger-scale technological reforms. The Party led farmers to implement cooperativization, completing the socialist transformation of agriculture. The cooperative economy replaced the individual economy, which opened up broad avenues for the comprehensive implementation of agricultural technology reforms.

The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong foresaw that the high tide of agricultural cooperativization would inevitably bring about an unprecedented high tide of agricultural production, and the conditions were in place to comprehensively implement agricultural production increase measures and promote advanced experiences. In 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong, in the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program (draft) which he personally drafted, put forward twelve measures to increase crop yields: building water conservancy projects; increasing fertilizer; improving old-style agricultural tools and promoting new-style agricultural tools; promoting improved varieties; expanding the multiple cropping area; planting more high-yield crops; implementing intensive cultivation and improving farming methods; improving soil; conserving water and soil; protecting and breeding livestock; eliminating pests and diseases; and reclaiming wasteland to expand cultivated land area. The experience of bumper harvests in 1956 and 1957, and the great bumper harvest of wheat in 1958, proved that vigorously grasping water conservancy construction, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, deep plowing and careful cultivation, rational close planting, and promoting improved varieties are mutually reinforcing and mutually beneficial important links to ensure agricultural production increase. The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 enhanced people's understanding. On the basis of summarizing farmers' advanced experience and scientific research results, after repeated research, Comrade Mao Zedong finally summarized the eight basic factors for crop production increase, which are soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, management, and tools. This is the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter." The Eight-Character Charter was extracted from the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, and is the basic measure among the twelve measures to increase production listed in the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program. It was affirmed by Chairman Mao after being proven by the practice of these three years of 1956, 1957, and 1958. The Chinese people have the Party's general line for socialist construction, the rural people's communes, and the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter," which has found a path for the high-speed development of our country's agriculture.

After the land reform was completed, some people raised the question: What should China's agriculture rely on to increase production? Can we increase production by relying solely on the original farming techniques? How can we use the favorable conditions created by the land reform to develop agricultural production? Some people once believed that the primary method was to implement agricultural mechanization, and use mechanization to promote cooperativization. Under the conditions that mechanization could not be achieved in our country at that time, this actually delayed cooperativization and waited for mechanization. The Party criticized this view. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that under China's specific conditions, we must first have cooperativization, and then we can use large machines. Before our country's agriculture is mechanized, we must use the superiority of cooperativization, promote advanced experiences, and reform agricultural technology to achieve agricultural production increase. Relying on agricultural production increase, accumulating more funds, promoting the development of industry, and thereby gradually preparing conditions for agricultural mechanization. We did not sit and wait for mechanization, but resolutely embarked on the road of relying on organization, vigorously promoting various production increase measures, and developing agricultural production. History has proven that we have taken the right path.

There has been such a debate: What are the fundamental measures to ensure China's agricultural production increase? Some say it mainly relies on the development of water conservancy, some say it mainly relies on raising pigs and accumulating manure, some say promoting improved varieties is the fastest way to see results, some emphasize tool reform, and some emphasize promoting rational close planting, etc. These opinions all have merit. However, the initial understanding is always incomplete, often grasping this item and relaxing that item, highlighting this point and losing that point. After continuous practice and continuous research, especially after Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the agricultural Eight-Character Charter, we realized the importance of comprehensive use of various production increase measures, and achieved a more comprehensive understanding.

Soil is the foundation, water, fertilizer, and seeds are the prerequisite, rational close planting is the center, and protection, management, and tools are the basic guarantee

The practice of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 further clarified the inherent relationship of the Eight-Character Charter. Soil is the foundation, water, fertilizer, and seeds are the prerequisite, rational close planting is the center, and protection, management, and tools are the basic guarantee.

Why are soil, fertilizer, water, and seeds the foundation and prerequisite? Because these are the conditions on which crops live and reproduce. Soil is the base for providing nutrients to crops. Crops grow on the soil and absorb the nutrients they need from it. The properties of the soil determine the growth, development, and reproduction of crops. Fertilizer provides various nutrient elements needed by crops and that constitute the crop's own organism, improves soil fertility, and can improve the structure of the soil. Water can keep the soil in a proper moist state at all times, which is conducive to the decomposition of nutrients and their transport into the crop body, and helps the division and growth of crop cells. Seeds are indispensable conditions for crops to pass on generations and expand reproduction. Improved varieties combined with good cultivation can quickly obtain high yields. Farmers say: soil is the root, fertilizer is the strength, water is life, and seeds are the foundation, which rightly illustrates the importance of these four characters.

Why is rational close planting the center? Because what constitutes crop yield is seedlings, plants, ears, and grains, and rational close planting can appropriately increase the number of seedlings and plants, so that they can effectively and fully utilize light energy and land fertility to achieve more ears, larger ears, more grains, and heavier grains, which can obtain much higher yields than sparse planting.

As for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and strengthening field management, it is necessary to overcome factors that are unfavorable to crop growth, increase favorable factors, and ensure the normal growth of crops. Tool reform can improve labor productivity and ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned production increase measures. In this way, a complete system of agricultural production increase measures is formed.

The people's commune system provides the conditions for comprehensively and on a larger scale implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter"

After the Eight-Character Charter was put forward, it was quickly accepted by the broad masses of people. It took root in the hearts of the broad masses of people, blossomed and bore fruit on the land.

The people's commune system in our country's rural areas provides the conditions for comprehensively and on a larger scale implementing the agricultural Eight-Character Charter.

Compared with 1949, grain production in the 1958 agricultural Great Leap Forward was 2.3 times higher, and cotton production was 4.7 times higher. Compared with 1957, grain increased by 130 billion jin and cotton increased by 9.2 million dan in one year. One of the main reasons is that, relying on cooperatives, entering the people's communes, using the mass line, boldly mobilizing the masses, and resolutely implementing the Eight-Character Charter. Grain and cotton production continued to leap forward in 1959, and output will increase by about 10% again, also because of the comprehensive and rational implementation of the agricultural Eight-Character Charter.

The Eight-Character Charter guarantees the rapid development of agricultural production, especially promoting the emergence of large-area high-yield fields. "The Eight-Character Charter, every character is worth a thousand gold," it is truly very effective. Wherever it is conscientiously implemented, agricultural production will rapidly leap forward, and the more thoroughly and comprehensively it is implemented, the faster agricultural production will leap forward. Low yield becomes high yield, high yield becomes even higher yield. The yields of major grain producing areas in our country, such as the Yangtze River, Pearl River, Han River deltas, the plains of Hunan and Hubei, the Sichuan Basin, the Guanzhong Plain, the Huanghuai Plain, and the Songliao Plain, have been greatly improved. The low-yield areas of North China are rapidly changing their appearance. Many old disaster areas in northern Anhui are catching up with southern Jiangsu after river networks have been established. High-yield records have also appeared in the mountainous areas of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Many grain-deficient areas have become surplus grain areas. Xiangyang in Hubei, Xinye in Henan, and Siyang in Jiangsu used to produce only about ten jin of ginned cotton per mu. In 1957, Xiangyang reached forty jin, Xinye reached fifty-three jin, and Siyang reached more than one hundred jin in 1958, all of which increased several times. The Eight-Character Charter removed the low-yield hats for many crops in many places. For example, the nationally renowned "poor stick cooperative" - a production team of the Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, has been continuously leaping forward in grain production in recent years. In 1952, the average yield per mu was only 121 jin, in 1956 it reached 440 jin, in 1957 it jumped to 517 jin, and in 1958 it jumped again to 606 jin. Why is the grain yield of this cooperative galloping forward like a horse with broken reins? The main reason is that on the basis of cooperativization, it has conscientiously implemented production increase measures such as improving soil, increasing fertilizer application, and building water conservancy projects. When the cooperative was first established, each mu of land had only about 1,000 jin of manure, but now it has reached 5,000 to 6,000 jin; before cooperativization, there was no irrigated land, but now two-thirds of the cultivated land can be irrigated; the method of mixing sand with soil and mixing yellow soil with sand has been adopted year by year, so that most of the barren land has been improved. Another example is a wheat experimental field of the Guanghui Brigade of the Jiudian Commune in Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province. It was originally an extremely barren sandy land with a yield of only dozens of jin per mu. After adopting the method of deep plowing and adding fertile soil in recent years, continuously improving the soil, and implementing rational close planting, rational fertilization, and timely irrigation to ensure that the wheat is well-fed, early prevention and quick treatment to eliminate pests and diseases, and preventing lodging and other measures, the average yield per mu of this year's 8.2 mu wheat experimental field jumped to 2,471 jin.

This year, due to the promotion of various production increase measures centered on rational close planting for winter wheat across the country, following last year's great bumper harvest of wheat, another leap forward bumper harvest has been achieved. The yield per unit area has increased by dozens of percent compared to last year, and some places have seen yields double. Wheat fields with a yield of more than 300 jin per mu account for about 50 to 60 million mu. Wanmu high-yield squares with yields of more than 600 jin per mu have appeared in Yanshi and Meng County in Henan, and Anguo in Hebei. These high-yield squares have generally achieved garden-style cultivation. The land is deeply plowed about one chi deep, and 7,000 to 8,000 jin or more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer is applied per mu. Timely and appropriate irrigation is carried out, and improved varieties such as Bima No. 1 and Baiyupi are selected. About 30 jin are sown per mu, and pest control, harrowing and weeding, frost prevention, and lodging prevention measures are carried out in a timely manner. From planting to harvesting, careful nursing is carried out, every link is closely linked, not relaxing one step, and becoming a model for the implementation of the Eight-Character Charter and a standard-bearer for large-area high yield.

The agricultural "Eight-Character Charter" is profoundly changing the face of agriculture in our country. The broad masses of farmers, with the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," are moving mountains to create seas, splitting ridges to divert rivers. Rivers have been harnessed, and the Yellow River and Huai River are benefiting the people. In 1958 alone, the irrigated area was expanded by nearly 500 million mu, many depressions were turned into fertile land, and slopes were transformed into terraces. Hundreds of millions of mu of saline-alkali soil, sandy wasteland, and red soil are being improved, and fertilizer is increasing year by year. People are conducting soil surveys to understand the soil conditions, further improving and utilizing the soil, and improving soil fertility. Improved varieties are being rapidly promoted, and new improved varieties are being cultivated. People are adopting new tools and promoting advanced cultivation methods according to new conditions, preparing conditions for agricultural modernization and the comprehensive revolution of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The promotion of the agricultural Eight-Character Charter is an indispensable step in the agricultural technology revolution in our country.

The agricultural "Eight-Character Charter" is a product of the agricultural Great Leap Forward under the illumination of the Party's general line, and was established in the intense struggle of continuously criticizing and overcoming right-leaning conservative thought

The proposal of the agricultural Eight-Character Charter is a new development in agricultural science. It guides people to study and further grasp the objective laws of agricultural production increase, break away from the passive position of waiting for natural gifts, and move towards actively transforming nature and striving for bumper harvests. The power of the agricultural Eight-Character Charter has confirmed the scientific predictions of Marx and Engels. Marx said: "If handled properly, the land will continue to be improved." Engels said: "The application of capital, labor, and science can infinitely increase the yield of land." The agricultural Eight-Character Charter shattered the bourgeois Malthusian population theory and the law of diminishing returns of land, and shattered the nonsense of right-leaning conservatism's agricultural backwardness theory, agricultural crawling theory, limited production increase theory, and fatalism. The agricultural Eight-Character Charter encourages people to open fire on nature, and the courage and confidence to fight for grain with the sky. The implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" not only directly promoted agricultural production increase, but also promoted the development of agricultural science. The "Eight-Character Charter" was produced on the basis of summarizing mass experience, and has been continuously tested, enriched, and improved in the production practice of the broad masses of people. In this way, it has provided extremely rich materials for the development of agricultural science, and at the same time has raised many new questions, requiring agricultural scientific workers to study and solve them. How to use these materials, absorb nutrients from them, and rise to theory through processing and refinement, so as to guide agricultural production practice more effectively, is the glorious mission of agricultural scientists.

The agricultural Eight-Character Charter is a product of the agricultural Great Leap Forward under the illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, and was established in the intense struggle of continuously criticizing and overcoming right-leaning conservative thought. Every victory in the struggle further demonstrated the brilliance of the "Eight-Character Charter." Newborn things are always not so perfect at the beginning, and when it is making great strides forward or encountering some difficulties in the process of advancing and developing certain shortcomings, it will be subjected to the criticism of right-leaning conservatives. In 1953, right-leaning conservatives emphasized adapting to the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy, ignored the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, and opposed agricultural technology reform, calling it rash advance. They distorted the facts, exaggerated the shortcomings, and described the newly promoted plow as a "hanging plow," and also exaggerated some of the shortcomings in the water conservancy construction at that time, such as calling the wells "watching wells" and the waterwheels "sleeping waterwheels," and so on. They believed that the peasants would grow crops themselves, and the leadership did not need to put effort into this aspect, advocating "non-action governance," regarding the necessary leadership for agricultural production as undue interference. In 1956, with the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, a magnificent high tide of agricultural production was also set off. In one year, the irrigated area was expanded by more than 118 million mu, and more than 1.08 million double-wheel double-share plows were promoted. The fertilized area and the amount of fertilization increased significantly compared with previous years. Improved varieties and close planting were also rapidly promoted, and grain and industrial raw material crops increased significantly. At the end of the year, right-leaning conservatives blew up a "small typhoon" again. They said that "the double-wheel double-share plow is one of the three evils," saying "close planting reduces production," and "too much fertilizer burns the crops to death." They described the reform of the cropping system implemented by many regions in accordance with local conditions as "rigidly promoting a certain high-yield crop, hastily changing the cropping system," and used the phenomenon of early heading of the Qingsen No. 5 improved variety promoted in individual regions to insist that the promotion of improved varieties caused losses, and so on. In short, they seized on temporary and individual shortcomings and examples to severely criticize various agricultural production increase measures, pouring cold water on activists in agricultural technology reform. As a result, the promotion of various agricultural production increase measures in 1957 was adversely affected, and compared with the two leaping years of 1956 and 1958, it constituted a "saddle-shaped" situation of high at both ends and low in the middle. In 1958, the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune system fully developed the wisdom and creativity of farmers, and achieved extremely great achievements in agricultural technology reform. Although some shortcomings were also produced in the movement, they were only one finger out of ten fingers. However, right-leaning opportunists and people with right-leaning conservative thoughts made a comeback. They negated the achievements, exaggerated the shortcomings, and attempted to drag agricultural production back to the old path of sticking to conventions. They seized on the example of a few experimental fields that failed to increase production or even reduce production due to over-dense planting, and completely negated the achievements of rational close planting and production increase in the vast majority of regions, so that the idea of sparse planting rose in some places. They used the individual shortcomings in water conservancy construction projects as an excuse to clamor that too many water conservancy projects were built, they were built too quickly, they were done badly, they were done chaotically, etc., causing a slack mood in some units for a time. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, these anti-rash advance winds were corrected in a timely manner, thereby ensuring the healthy development of the agricultural production movement.

Judging from the struggles experienced in the formation and implementation of the Eight-Character Charter, the so-called "anti-rash advance" of right-leaning opportunists is actually opposing the high-speed development of socialist agriculture in our country. The struggle over agricultural production increase measures is often linked to the struggle between the two roads and two methods of agricultural development. Those who hold a negative attitude towards the socialist transformation and socialist construction of agriculture are also negative about the promotion of agricultural production increase measures. They are always afraid of doing too much and doing too fast, oppose technological reform, and hope to maintain the status quo. The struggle to defend the agricultural Eight-Character Charter is essentially the struggle to defend the Party's general line for socialist construction, to defend the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and to defend the people's communes.

Well summarize and promote the agricultural production increase experience among the masses, promote agricultural production, develop the "Eight-Character Charter," and improve the level of agricultural science

The agricultural Eight-Character Charter itself is summarized and developed in production practice. With the continuous development of agricultural production, the continued improvement of production conditions, and the in-depth development of scientific research, the Eight-Character Charter will continue to be popularized and improved.

Taking rational close planting as an example, we originally had little experience. After repeated practice in various places, the understanding gradually approached objective reality. We understand the benefits of rational close planting, mainly to effectively use light energy, make full use of land fertility, and achieve the goal of more plants, more ears, larger ears, and full grains, but not the denser the better. Now it seems that to achieve rational close planting, we should both maximize the development of all plants, that is, the population, per unit area, and ensure that all single plants, that is, individuals, can grow normally; we must both ensure that the underground parts can fully utilize water and nutrients, and ensure that the above-ground parts can fully utilize sunlight and air; we must both ensure that the crops can grow normally in the early stage, and ensure that the crops can develop normally in the later stage; we must both cultivate the main ear and promote effective tillering; and under different climates, different locations, different water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, different crops, different varieties, and different field management levels, we should appropriately adopt different densities. In a certain area, what level of close planting is considered rational still needs to be carefully studied and continue to accumulate experience. Production increase through rational close planting is the result of the comprehensive effect of multiple conditions and multiple measures, and cannot be viewed in isolation. Therefore, the other seven characters also need to be systematically and deeply studied, comprehensively applied, and truly achieve
"Five flavors are harmonized and a hundred flavors are fragrant" to achieve the goal of production increase.

The production increase effect of the Eight-Character Charter has long been affirmed throughout the country; but because our country has a vast territory and the natural and economic conditions vary greatly, the specific requirements and practices for implementing the Eight-Character Charter in various places cannot be the same. The successful experience in this place may not necessarily be successful when moved to another place, and it must be emphasized that measures should be adapted to the time and local conditions. At the same time, how to fully play the role of each character of the agricultural Eight-Character Charter still needs to be explored in depth, and the laws of production increase of various crops need to be systematically studied. We must uncover the secrets of nature more deeply, so that the content of the Eight-Character Charter can be more substantial, more accurate, and more powerful to serve the continued leap forward of agriculture in our country.

Agriculture is a combination of natural reproduction processes and social reproduction processes. Therefore, studying agriculture requires not only studying its laws from natural sciences such as biology, soil science, chemistry, mechanical mechanics, meteorology, etc., but also studying its laws from the perspective of economic development. It is necessary to study both the requirements of the agricultural Eight-Character Charter for crops themselves at various different stages of growth and development, and to study how to give full play to the superiority of the people's communes, and highly develop the economic effects of the Eight-Character Charter from aspects such as improving labor productivity, reducing costs, and cultivating land fertility. Systematically observe, record, analyze, and study the experiences in these two aspects, and scientifically theorize them, find the laws, propose measures, and serve the continuous leap forward of agricultural production. This is a common task of the national agricultural departments, agricultural scientific research institutions, agricultural schools, and all agricultural workers.

At present, agricultural production in our country is mainly carried out under the conditions of human and animal power. After our country completes the socialist transformation of agriculture, on the basis of continuing to consolidate and develop the people's communes, gradually transition to agricultural mechanization through the road of tool reform and semi-mechanization, and gradually realize the mechanization and electrification of the agricultural production process, is the fundamental way to improve labor productivity and develop agriculture in our country. Therefore, in addition to further developing the production increase effect of the Eight-Character Charter on the basis of existing cultivation, we must also earnestly and practically study how to use the agricultural Eight-Character Charter under the conditions of large-scale mechanized operation. This is related to the path of agricultural mechanization in our country, and how to carry forward the excellent tradition of intensive farming in our country after mechanization is realized. These are all brand-new topics for us, and we must work hard to carry out research work to prepare for the mechanization and electrification of agriculture in our country.

The existing agricultural production increase experience among the masses is very rich, and many new experiences will continue to emerge in the future in the process of comprehensively implementing the Eight-Character Charter. Well summarizing and promoting these advanced experiences is of extremely important significance for promoting agricultural production, developing the Eight-Character Charter, and improving the level of agricultural science. At the same time, we must conscientiously implement the policy of scientific and technological service for production, and make a good job of agricultural scientific research work in a planned way around the Eight-Character Charter, organize scientific research departments, agricultural education departments, and the experimental research forces of the people's communes, and use large and small farms and experimental fields to conduct various scientific comparative experiments, establish archives, carefully observe, record in detail, grasp reliable data, analyze and study carefully, affirm the role of various production increase measures, and find the corresponding proportional relationship of the comprehensive application of various factors, so that we can more confidently propose methods and measures for appropriately applying the "Eight-Character Charter" according to local conditions, time, and crops. For example, in terms of food crops, how to achieve more ears, larger ears, more grains, and heavier grains; in terms of cotton, how to prevent bud and boll shedding and achieve more bolls, larger bolls, and heavier bolls, these are the central issues for increasing the yield per unit area of grain and cotton, and should be well studied as a key point.

### 农业“八字宪法”的形成和发展

    农业“八字宪法”的形成和发展
    农业部副部长　刘瑞龙
    农业“八字宪法”是农业发展纲要四十条所列十二项增产措施中的基本措施
    在1958年农业生产大跃进中，毛泽东同志总结了农民的增产经验和解放以来农业技术改革的经验，系统地提出了农业“八字宪法”，这是党的领导、群众经验和科学研究相结合的产物。
    我国农民在长期生产劳动中，积累了丰富的经验。“儿要亲生，地要深耕”，“深耕长谷，浅耕长壳”，“猪肥苗壮，猪瘦苗枯”，“粪大水勤，不用问人”，“母壮儿肥，好种壮秧”，“三分种，七分管，人勤地不懒”等等这样的庄稼话，各地可以找到许许多多。这些话里，已经提出了促使农业增产的若干基本经验，过去也有运用这些经验获得高产的事实。不过，在很长时期内，对广大农民说来，这些经验还仅仅是一种直观的、自发的、零散的东西。许多人知道这样干，而不明白为什么要这样干的道理，“知其然，不知其所以然”。
    在封建土地制度的剥削下，常常是产量越高，租税越重，广大农民对于改进耕作方法的兴趣和积极性是不高的。人们在被剥削压迫得喘不过气来的时候，没有心思、也没有力量去注意增产问题。
    解放后，实行了土地改革，废除了封建剥削制度，情况发生了根本变化，农民获得了发展生产的可能。各地开始注意总结和推广农民的先进经验来提高产量，陈永康的水稻丰产经验，曲耀离的棉花丰产经验，史安福的小麦丰产经验，在全国粮棉增产上，曾经发挥了良好的推动作用。广大农民群众的经验和智慧得到了发展。党和人民政府领导农民兴修水利，增施肥料，合理密植，防治病虫害，繁殖耕牛，增修农具，选用良种等各项增产措施，三年内，完成了恢复农业生产的任务，粮棉产量超过了解放前的最高水平。但是，个体小农经济毕竟是脆弱的，经不起自然灾害的袭击，无力进行规模较大的技术改革。党领导农民实行了合作化，完成了农业的社会主义改造，合作经济代替了个体经济，这就为全面推行农业技术改革开辟了广阔的道路。
    党中央和毛泽东同志预见到，农业合作化的高潮必然会带来一个空前的农业生产高潮，全面地推行农业增产措施和推广先进经验的条件具备了。1955年毛泽东同志在他亲手拟订的全国农业发展纲要（草案）四十条中，就提出了增加农作物产量的十二项增产措施：兴修水利；增加肥料；改良旧式农具和推广新式农具；推广优良品种；扩大复种面积；多种高产作物；实行精耕细作，改进耕作方法；改良土壤；保持水土；保护和繁殖耕畜；消灭虫害和病害；开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。1956、1957两年丰收和1958年小麦大丰收的经验，都证明了大抓兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、深耕细作、合理密植、推广良种等是相辅而行、相互为用的保证农业增产的重要环节。1958年农业生产的大跃进，提高了人们的认识。在总结农民先进经验和科学研究成果的基础上，经过反复研究，最后由毛泽东同志概括出农作物增产的八个基本因素，这就是土、肥、水、种、密、保、管、工，这八个字的农业“八字宪法”。八字宪法是从农业四十条纲要中提炼出来的，是农业四十条纲要所列十二项增产措施中的基本措施，经过1956、1957、1958这三年的实践证明以后，毛主席加以肯定的。中国人民有了党的社会主义建设的总路线，有了农村的人民公社化，再加上农业“八字宪法”，这就为我国农业找到了一条高速度发展的道路。
    在土地改革完成后，曾经有人提出这样的问题：中国农业究竟靠什么来增产？光靠原有的耕作技术能不能增产？怎样利用土地改革所创造的有利条件来发展农业生产？有人曾经认为首要的方法是实行农业的机械化，用机械化来促进合作化。这在我国一时不能实现机械化的条件下，实际是推迟合作化，等待机械化。党批评了这种观点。党中央和毛泽东同志指出，在我国具体条件下，必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。在我国农业尚未机械化以前，我们必须运用合作化的优越性，推广先进经验，改革农业技术，达到农业增产。依靠农业增产，积累更多的资金，推动工业的发展，从而为农业机械化逐步准备条件。我们没有坐等机械化，坚决走上了依靠组织起来，大力推行各种增产措施，发展农业生产的道路。历史证明我们的道路是走对了。
    曾经发生过这样的争论：保证我国农业增产的根本措施是什么？有的说主要是发展水利，有的说主要依靠养猪积肥，有的说推广良种见效最快，有的强调工具改革，有的强调推行合理密植等。这些意见都有道理。但是，开始认识总是不完全的，往往是抓住了这一项，放松了那一项，突出了这一点，丢掉了那一点。经过不断实践，不断钻研，特别是毛泽东同志提出农业八字宪法之后，才体会到各项增产措施综合为用的重要，取得了比较全面的认识。
    土壤是基础，水、肥、种是前提，合理密植是中心，保、管、工是基本保证
    1958年农业生产大跃进的实践，进一步阐明了八字宪法的内在关系。土壤是基础，水、肥、种是前提，合理密植是中心，保、管、工是基本保证。
    为什么说土、肥、水、种是基础和前提呢？因为这些都是农作物赖以生活和繁殖的条件。土壤是供给农作物营养的基地。农作物生长在土壤上，从中吸取所需要的营养物质。土壤的性状决定着农作物生长发育和繁殖的状况。肥料提供农作物所需要的也是构成农作物机体本身的各种营养元素，提高土壤肥力，并可改善土壤的结构。水分可以使土壤经常保持适当的湿润状态，有利于养料的分解和输送到作物机体内并且帮助作物细胞的分裂和增长。种子则是农作物传宗接代、扩大再生产不可缺少的条件。良种结合良好的栽培，可以迅速获得高额产量。农民说：土是根，肥是劲，水是命，种是老本，正说明了这四个字的重要性。
    为什么说合理密植是中心呢？因为构成农作物产量的是苗、株、穗、粒，而合理密植，恰恰能够适当地增加苗株，使它有效地并且是充分地利用光能和地力，达到穗多、穗大、粒多、粒重，比起稀植的庄稼，能够获得高得多的产量。
    至于防治病虫害，加强田间管理，则是克服不利于作物生长的因素、增加有利因素、保证作物正常生长所必需的。工具改革可以提高劳动生产率，保证上述各项增产措施的贯彻执行。这样，就形成了一个农业增产措施的完整体系。
    人民公社化提供了全面地更大规模地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的条件
    八字宪法提出后，很快就为广大群众所接受，它在广大人民心目中生了根，在大地上开了花、结了果。
    我国农村的人民公社化，提供了全面的更大规模的贯彻执行农业八字宪法的条件。
    1958年农业大跃进，和1949年相比，粮食产量相当二点三倍，棉花产量相当四点七倍。和1957年相比，一年增加粮食一千三百亿斤，棉花九百二十万担，主要原因之一就是依靠合作社，进到人民公社，运用群众路线，放手发动群众，坚决贯彻执行了八字宪法。1959年粮食、棉花生产继续跃进，产量都将再增10％左右，也因为全面合理地贯彻执行了农业八字宪法。
    八字宪法保证了农业生产的迅速发展，特别是促进了大面积丰产田的出现。“八字宪法，字字千金”，真正灵得很。凡是认真贯彻执行的地方，农业生产就迅速跃进，执行得越彻底越全面，农业生产跃进就越快。低产变高产，高产更高产；我国主要粮食产区如长江、珠江、韩江等三角洲、两湖平原，四川盆地，关中平原，黄淮平原，松辽平原等地区的产量都大大提高了。华北低产区正在迅速改变面貌。淮北老灾区不少地方在河网化后正在赶上江南。云贵高原山区也出现了高产的纪录。许多缺粮区变成余粮区。湖北襄阳、河南新野、江苏泗阳过去每亩只产皮棉十斤左右，1957年襄阳达到四十斤，新野达到五十三斤，1958年泗阳达到一百斤以上，都翻了好几番。八字宪法摘去了许多地方不少作物的低产帽子。例如全国闻名的“穷棒子社”——河北省遵化县建明人民公社的一个生产队，几年来，粮食产量不断跃进增产。1952年平均亩产只有一百二十一斤，1956年达到四百四十斤，1957年跃到五百一十七斤，1958年又跃到六百零六斤。为什么这个社的粮食产量像脱了缰绳的马一样向前飞奔呢？主要是在合作化的基础上认真地贯彻了改良土壤、增施肥料、兴修水利等增产措施。刚刚办社的时候，每亩地只有圈肥一千斤左右，现在已达到五、六千斤；合作化以前没有水浇地，现在已有三分之二的耕地可以得到灌溉；逐年采用沙掺土和黄土地掺沙的办法，使大部分贫瘠的土地得以改良。又如安徽省萧县九店公社光辉大队的一块小麦试验田，原来是极为瘠薄的拢沙地，亩产量只有几十斤，经过近几年来采用了深耕加肥土的办法，不断改良土壤，并实行了合理密植、合理施肥、及时灌溉，保证小麦吃饱喝足、早防快治消灭病虫害、防止倒伏等措施，使今年的八点二亩小麦试验田平均亩产跃升到二千四百七十一斤。
    今年全国各地冬小麦由于推行了以合理密植为中心的各项增产措施，继去年小麦大丰收之后又获得了跃进的丰收，单位面积产量比去年提高了百分之几十，有的地方产量获得成倍的增长。亩产三百斤以上的麦田约计在五、六千万亩以上。河南偃师、孟县、河北安国都出现了亩产六百斤以上的万亩丰产方。这些丰产方，普遍实现园田化。土地深翻一尺左右，每亩施肥七、八千斤或一万斤以上，作到适时适量灌溉，选用了碧蚂一号、白玉皮等良种，每亩播种三十斤左右，并且及时进行了治虫、耙锄、防霜、防倒伏等措施，从种到收，精心护理，环环扣紧，一着不松，一步不让，成为贯彻八字宪法的典范和大面积丰产的旗手。
    农业“八字宪法”正在极其深刻地改变着我国农业的面貌。广大农民以“要高山低头河水让路”的英雄气概，移山造海、劈岭引河，江河得到治理，黄淮为民造福。1958年一年就扩大灌溉面积近五亿亩，很多洼地变成沃壤，坡地改为梯田。几亿亩盐碱土、沙荒土、红壤正在被改良，肥料年年增加，人们正在经过土壤普查，摸清土壤底细，进一步改良和利用土壤，提高土壤肥力。良种迅速推广，新的良种正在培育出来。人们正在根据新的条件，采用新的工具，推行先进的栽培方法，为农业的现代化，为农、林、牧、副、渔五业的全线大革命准备着条件。农业八字宪法的推行，是我国农业技术革命必不可少的步骤。
    农业“八字宪法”是在党的总路线照耀下农业大跃进的产物，是在不断地批判和克服右倾保守思想的激烈斗争中确立下来的
    农业八字宪法的提出，是农业科学上的新发展，它引导人们去钻研和进一步掌握农业增产的客观规律，摆脱等待自然恩赐的被动地位，走向主动改造自然争取丰收的道路。农业八字宪法的威力证实了马克思、恩格斯的科学预言。马克思说：“处理得当，土地却会不断地改良。”恩格斯说：“应用资本、劳动和科学，可以使土地的收获量无限的提高。”农业八字宪法粉碎了资产阶级的马尔萨斯人口论和土地报酬递减律的胡说，粉碎了右倾保守主义的农业落后论、农业爬行论、增产有限论和听天由命论。农业八字宪法鼓舞着人们向大自然开战，与天争粮的勇气和信心。“八字宪法”的贯彻执行，不仅直接促进了农业增产，同时也促进了农业科学的发展。“八字宪法”是在总结群众经验的基础上产生的，又不断在广大群众的生产实践中得到检验、丰富和提高。这样，就为农业科学的发展提供了极为丰富的材料，同时也提出了许多新的问题，要求农业科学工作者加以研究和解决。如何利用这些材料，从中吸收养分，经过加工提炼，上升到理论，用来更有效地指导农业生产实践，这是农业科学家们的光荣使命。
    农业八字宪法是在党的建设社会主义总路线的照耀下农业大跃进的产物，是在不断地批判和克服右倾保守思想的激烈斗争中确立下来的。每一次斗争的胜利，都是进一步显示了“八字宪法”的光辉。新生的事物一开始总不会那样完善，当它在大踏步前进时或在前进中遇到一点困难发生某些缺点时，就要遭受到右倾保守主义者的责难。1953年右倾保守主义者强调适应小农经济现状，忽视对小农经济的改造，把农业技术改革说成是冒进而加以反对。他们歪曲事实，夸大缺点，把当时推广的新式步犁，说成什么“挂犁”，对当时兴修水利中的一些缺点也加以夸大，如把水井说成什么“看井”，把水车说成什么“睡车”等等。他们认为农民自己会种庄稼，领导上用不着在这方面下功夫，主张“无为而治”，把对农业生产必要的领导当成不应有的干涉。1956年伴随着农业合作化高潮的到来，同时掀起了气势磅礴的农业生产高潮，一年间，扩大灌溉面积一亿一千八百多万亩，推广双轮双铧犁一百零八万部，施肥面积和施肥数量比往年大量增加，良种、密植等也得到迅速推广，粮食和工业原料作物大量增产。年底右倾保守主义者又吹起了一阵“小台风”，他们说什么“双轮双铧犁是三害之一”，说“密植减产”，“肥料过多把庄稼烧死了”，他们把许多地区因地制宜推行的耕作制度改革说成是“硬性推广某种高产作物，草率改变耕作制度”，又利用个别地区推广青森五号良种提早抽穗的现象而硬说推广良种造成损失等等。总之抓住一时一事的个别缺点和事例，对各项农业增产措施大肆指责。给农业技术改革中的积极分子泼冷水。结果使1957年各项农业增产措施的推广都受到了不利的影响，和1956、1958两个跃进的年头相比，就构成了两头高中间低的“马鞍形”的形势。1958年大跃进、人民公社化，农民的智慧和创造性得到充分发挥，农业技术改革方面获得极其伟大的成就。运动中虽然也产生了些缺点，只不过是十个指头中的一个指头。而右倾机会主义分子和有右倾保守思想的人，却又死灰复燃，他们否定成绩，夸大缺点，企图把农业生产拖回到墨守成规的老路上去。他们抓住少数试验田由于种植过密以致未能增产甚至减产的例子，便一口否定绝大部分地区合理密植增产的成绩，以致有些地方稀植思想抬头。他们借口水利建设工程中个别缺点，就大肆喧嚷水利建设搞多了，搞快了，办糟了，办乱了等等，以致在某些单位一度产生松劲情绪。由于中央和毛主席的正确领导，这几次反冒进的歪风都被及时地纠正了，从而保证了农业生产运动的健康发展。
    从八字宪法的形成和执行过程中所经历的斗争来看，右倾机会主义者的所谓“反冒进”，实际是反对我国社会主义农业的高速度发展。在农业增产措施问题上的斗争，经常是和农业发展上的两条道路两种方法的斗争连在一起的。对农业社会主义改造和社会主义建设抱消极态度的人，对农业增产措施的推广也是消极的，他们总是害怕搞多了、搞快了，反对技术改革，希图保持现状。保卫农业八字宪法的斗争，实质上就是保卫党的社会主义建设总路线，保卫农业生产大跃进，保卫人民公社的斗争。
    很好地总结和推广群众中的农业增产经验，促进农业生产，发展“八字宪法”，提高农业科学水平
    农业八字宪法本身是在生产实践中总结出来并得到发展的。随着农业生产的不断发展，生产条件的继续改善，科学研究的深入展开，八字宪法也将继续得到普及和提高。
    拿合理密植来说，原来我们的经验是不多的。经过各地反复实践，认识就逐渐接近客观实际。使我们明白合理密植的好处，主要是能够有效地利用光能，充分利用地力，达到株多、穗多、穗大、籽粒饱满的目的，而并不是越密越好。现在看起来，要做到合理密植，就应该既要使单位面积上所有植株即群体得到最大的发展，又要使所有单株即个体能够正常生长；既要使地下部分能够充分利用水分和养料，又要使地上部分能够充分利用日光和空气，既要使作物前期能够正常生长，又要使作物后期能够正常发育；既要培育主穗，又要促进有效分蘖；而且在不同气候，不同地点，不同水利、肥料、土壤，不同作物，不同品种，不同田间管理水平等条件下，适当采取不同的密度。在某一个地区，究竟密植到什么程度才算合理，还需要各地精心研究，继续积累经验。合理密植增产是多种条件、多项措施综合发挥作用的结果，不能孤立的看待。因此，对其它七字措施也还需要进行系统深入的研究，综合运用，真正作到
  “五味调和百味香”，才能达到增产的目的。
    八字宪法的增产效果是全国各地早已肯定了的；但是由于我国地域辽阔，自然条件和经济条件差别很大，各地贯彻八字宪法的具体要求和做法不能千篇一律，这个地方的成功经验，照样搬到另一个地方就不一定能够成功，必须强调因时因地制宜。同时，如何充分发挥农业八字宪法每一个字的作用，也还有待于深入探索，各种农作物增产的规律都还需要系统地进行研究。我们要更深入地揭开自然界秘密，使八字宪法的内容更充实更准确更有力地为我国农业的继续跃进服务。
    农业是自然再生产过程和社会再生产过程的结合。因此，研究农业不仅要从自然科学，例如生物学、土壤学、化学、机械力学、气象学等等方面研究它的规律，还要从经济发展方面研究它的规律。既要研究农作物本身在生长发育各个不同阶段对农业八字宪法的要求，又要研究如何充分发挥人民公社的优越性，从提高劳动生产率、降低成本、培养地力等方面，高度发挥八字宪法的经济效果。系统地观察记载、分析研究这两方面的经验，加以科学理论的概括，找到规律，提出措施，为农业生产的连续跃进服务。这是国家农业部门、农业科学研究机关、农业学校、所有农业工作者当前的一项共同任务。
    我国农业生产目前主要还是在人力、畜力条件下进行的。在我国农业完成社会主义改造之后，在继续巩固和发展人民公社的基础上，经过工具改革、半机械化的道路逐步向农业机械化过渡，逐步地实现农业生产过程的机械化和电气化，是提高劳动生产率发展我国农业的根本出路。所以除在现有耕作基础上进一步发挥八字宪法的增产作用外，还要认真地切实地研究在大规模机械化操作条件下如何运用农业八字宪法的问题。这就联系到我国农业机械化的途径问题，在实现机械化后如何发扬我国精耕细作的优良传统问题。这些，对我们来说，都是崭新的课题，必须艰苦地进行研究工作，为我国农业的机械化电气化作好准备。
    群众中已有的农业增产经验是非常丰富的，而且今后在全面贯彻八字宪法过程中，还会层出不穷地继续创造出许多新经验。很好地总结、推广这些先进经验，对于促进农业生产，发展八字宪法，提高农业科学水平都有极其重要的意义。同时，也要认真贯彻科学技术为生产服务的方针，围绕八字宪法，有计划地做好农业科学研究工作，组织科学研究部门、农业教育部门、以及人民公社的试验研究力量，利用大、小农场、试验田，进行各种科学的对比试验，建立档案，认真观察，详细记载，掌握可靠的资料，细致地分析研究，肯定各项增产措施的作用，并找出综合运用各个因素的相应比例关系，使我们能够比较更有把握地提出因地、因时、因作物恰当运用“八字宪法”的方法和措施。例如在粮食作物方面，如何达到穗多、穗大、粒多、粒重；棉花方面，如何防止蕾铃脱落，达到铃多、铃大、铃重，这些都是提高粮食、棉花单位面积产量的中心问题，应该作为重点，很好地进行研究。
