    Green Trees Provide Shade
    The Community History Compilation Committee of Xinmin People's Commune, Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, with the assistance of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has compiled a literary community history – “Green Trees Provide Shade,” as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation.
    A portion of this community history has been selected and published in Sichuan Province's literary journals. After significant revisions and additions, it has been submitted to the Writers Publishing House for publication.
    The community history contains twenty-six articles, totaling over one hundred thousand words. It comprehensively and systematically records the glorious journey of the Xinmin People's Commune's gradual growth and strengthening over the past decade under the wise leadership of the Party – from liberation to land reform, to the establishment of mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and finally to the transformation into a people's commune. It narrates the struggles of the broad masses of peasants under the leadership of the Party during the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, as well as the soaring enthusiasm and heroic spirit displayed by the broad masses of peasants in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, and the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. The articles are mostly based on the oral accounts of key members and advanced elements of the Xinmin Commune. The content is specific and vivid, the language is simple and lively, and it is touching to read.

    绿树成荫
    四川省新繁县新民人民公社社史编写委员会在四川省文联协助下，编成了一部文艺性的社史——“绿树成荫”，作为建国十周年献礼。
    这部社史曾经在四川省的文艺刊物上选载过一部分，之后又经过较大的修改、补充，已交由作家出版社出版。
    社史共收集了二十六篇文章，约十多万字。它概括地、系统地记述了新民人民公社在党的英明领导下，十年来逐步成长、壮大的光辉历程——从解放，到土改，到成立互助组、合作社，直到转为人民公社；叙述了广大农民在党的领导下，所经历的民主革命和社会主义革命的斗争过程，以及广大农民在社会主义建设大跃进中所表现出来的冲天干劲和英雄气概，以及人民公社的无比优越性。文章大都是新民公社的骨干、先进分子口述的，内容具体、形象，语言朴素、生动，读来亲切感人。
