Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th -- A mass rally protesting France's nuclear tests in the Sahara was held here today under the auspices of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council.

    Anwar Sadat, General Secretary of the Arab National Union, delivered a speech as the chairman of the 1958 Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference. He condemned France's threat as directed not only at Africa but also at the new forces of Afro-Asian solidarity, which insist on establishing lasting peace and opposing war.

    Algerian Minister of Culture Taufik al-Madani stated at the meeting that the Algerian people would not be intimidated by force and would persist in their great national liberation revolution.

    Chinese representative Zhu Ziqi stated in his speech that we will mobilize all forces to oppose France's nuclear tests in the Sahara and other regions of Africa and to oppose France's colonialist policy.

    He said that the Chinese people have always enthusiastically cared for and fully supported the African people's anti-colonialist national independence struggle.

    We believe that today, when the world's forces for peace are unprecedentedly strong and the national liberation movement is at its height, the French imperialists' heinous plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara, all the imperialists' policies of war and aggression, and all the evil activities of the colonial rulers will be thoroughly crushed by the united action of the people of all countries.

    Representatives from Uganda, Cameroon, Southern Rhodesia, and Equatorial Africa in Africa, in their speeches, expressed their firm opposition to France's use of any African land for nuclear testing.

    The last speaker was Soviet representative Rashidov. He pointed out that France's planned test threatens the lives of millions of Africans, who now hope to end centuries of colonial slavery in Africa. He pointed out that the purpose of this French test is to threaten and weaken the national liberation movement that is rising in French-ruled Africa.

    The conference finally passed a resolution stating that the representatives of Afro-Asian groups at this conference in Cairo demonstrated the unanimous aspirations of millions of people and declared their firm opposition to the French imperialists' plan to conduct nuclear tests in the Sahara.

    The resolution pointed out that the French imperialists' plan to detonate nuclear weapons in the Sahara Desert is part of their aggressive plan against the peace-loving people of Africa, aimed at hindering and suppressing the struggle of all the African people, especially the heroic Algerian people, for freedom.

    各国代表痛斥法国的罪恶勾当
    据新华社开罗7日电　在亚非人民团结理事会书记处主持下，这里今天举行了抗议法国在撒哈拉进行核试验的群众大会。
    阿联民族联盟总书记安瓦尔·萨达特以1958年亚非人民团结大会主席的身份发表演说。他谴责法国的威胁不仅指向非洲，还指向亚非团结的新力量。这种力量坚持要建立持久和平和反对战争。
    阿尔及利亚文化部长陶菲克·迈达尼在会上表示，武力吓不倒阿尔及利亚人民，他们将坚持进行伟大的民族解放革命。
    中国代表朱子奇在会上讲话时说，我们将动员一切力量反对法国将在撒哈拉和非洲其他地区进行的核试验，反对法国的殖民主义政策。
    他说，中国人民一直热情地关心和充分支持非洲人民反殖民主义的民族独立斗争。
    我们相信，今天当世界和平力量已经空前地强大，民族解放运动正处于高潮的时候，法帝国主义者打算在撒哈拉进行核试验的罪恶计划，帝国主义者所有的战争和侵略政策以及殖民地统治者的一切罪恶活动，都将被一切国家的人民的联合行动所彻底粉碎。
    来自非洲的乌干达、喀麦隆、南罗得西亚、赤道非洲的代表们在讲话时，都表示坚决反对法国利用任何非洲的土地来进行核试验。
    最后讲话的是苏联代表拉希多夫。他指出，法国的这个计划中的试验，威胁着千百万非洲人的生命。这些非洲人现在希望结束非洲百年来的殖民奴隶制度。他指出，法国这个试验的目的在于威胁和削弱在法国统治的非洲中兴起的民族解放运动。
    大会最后通过决议说，亚非各团体代表在开罗举行的这次大会，表明了千百万广大人民一致的愿望，并且宣布了坚决反对法帝国主义计划在撒哈拉进行核试验。
    决议指出，法帝国主义者打算在撒哈拉沙漠爆炸核武器，是他们反对非洲爱好和平人民的侵略计划的一部分，目的在于阻挠和镇压非洲全体人民，特别是英勇的阿尔及利亚人民争取自由的斗争。
