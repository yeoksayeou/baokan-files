The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Education Work" on September 19, 1958. This instruction, based on the experience of educational undertakings since the founding of the country and the development of the great leap forward in socialist construction, more clearly and systematically put forward our country's education policy: education serves proletarian politics, and education is combined with productive labor. It has been a whole year since then. During this period, China's education cause has undergone a profound revolution and achieved brilliant achievements.

In the past year, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, the people of the whole country have realized the great leap forward in national economic construction and the communization of rural people's communes. Education has also adapted to the needs of the new situation and made rapid leaps forward. In the past year, the country carried out literacy work among 60 million people, and industrial, mining enterprises and people's communes established various types of spare-time schools at all levels, and the broad masses of people participated in learning. Many cities and counties across the country have basically popularized primary school education, and the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached more than 85%, with 86 million primary school students, an increase of 22.2 million over 1957, a growth of 34%; 9.9 million middle school students, an increase of 2.9 million over 1957, a growth of 41%; and 660,000 college students, an increase of 220,000 over 1957, a growth of 50%. The great development of China's education cause is beyond the reach of any capitalist country. Through the education revolution, the Party's leading position in school education has been further consolidated, and its prestige has been further enhanced. In the education revolution, schools at all levels and of all types have established factories and farms on a large scale, students have participated in productive labor, combined teaching and productive labor, strengthened labor viewpoints, transformed their thinking, and at the same time enabled students to learn knowledge actively and thoroughly. The quality of education has been improved more than in the past. Bourgeois educational ideology has been further exposed and criticized, teachers' ideological transformation has been deepened, and under the principle of teaching and learning from each other, the guiding role of teachers has been brought into play, and a democratic, equal and united cooperative teacher-student relationship has been established.

The facts of the past year further prove that the achievements of the education revolution are unprecedentedly great, and the Party's education policy is completely correct. On the first anniversary of the publication of the Party's instructions on education work, reviewing the great achievements of the past has extremely rich practical significance. Only with a correct understanding of what has been done, and a full estimate of the achievements, can we be full of confidence in the future cause and forge ahead courageously. At present, the situation on China's education front is very good. We have achieved a decisive victory in the revolution on the political and ideological front. The Party's education policy has been grasped by the broad masses of teachers and students. The teaching level of teachers and the learning quality of students are also rising step by step, and the education revolution is developing in depth. Under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, and inspired by the situation of the continued leap forward in socialist construction, we must go all out, aim high, overcome certain right-leaning conservative ideas and other erroneous ideas, and let the Party's education policy emit greater brilliance.

The facts of the past year have proved that China's education work must cultivate and educate students in accordance with the world outlook of the working class and the educational principles of socialism and communism, so as to ensure that education serves proletarian politics. We must continue to adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics. In all schools, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of Marxism-Leninism, cultivate the class viewpoint of the working class among teachers and students, and oppose bourgeois viewpoints; cultivate mass viewpoints and collective viewpoints, and oppose individualism; cultivate labor viewpoints, that is, the viewpoint of combining mental labor and physical labor, and oppose the viewpoint of despising physical labor and physical laborers and advocating the separation of mental labor and physical labor; cultivate dialectical materialism viewpoints, and oppose idealism and metaphysical viewpoints. Only in this way can we cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, instead of bourgeois intellectuals who are divorced from proletarian politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. Any neglect of systematic study of Marxist-Leninist theory and political education courses is wrong. Theory must be linked with practice, and students must participate in political movements. Schools are an organic part of social life, and schools cannot be divorced from social life and become "ivory towers." Therefore, schools should educate students in connection with the political situation, and organize students to participate in national political movements, so that students can be tempered and educated, and better serve the cause of socialist construction.

The facts of the past year have proved that education must be combined with productive labor. Students participating in productive labor to realize the laborization of intellectuals is beneficial to moral, intellectual and physical education, and it is a correct way to cultivate well-rounded new people. More than 1,400 graduates of Tsinghua University this year have strengthened their labor viewpoints, improved their political awareness, and combined with the actual needs of production through productive labor practice. The results of their graduation designs, whether in the engineering and technical problems solved in combination with production, or the scientific and technological level reached in scientific research, and the comprehensive training stipulated in the professional training goals, have exceeded those of previous years. In their graduation designs, they have completed 177 important production and scientific research tasks assigned by the state. These young students who have not yet stepped out of the school gate have completed such a huge task because they have implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor. This is a very good example. Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas are afraid that productive labor will affect teaching, so they relax or even cancel productive labor, which is obviously wrong. In all schools, productive labor must be included in the teaching plan, and students should be arranged to participate in various physical labor, or participate in productive labor in factories and farms run by schools, or go to the countryside and factories to participate in productive labor, or participate in certain social public welfare labor. Productive labor that can be combined with teaching requirements should be combined as much as possible; those that cannot be combined or cannot be directly combined must also be carried out according to the prescribed time, and the combination of teaching should not be unilaterally emphasized while ignoring productive labor. Full-time schools should conscientiously implement the "Regulations on the Arrangement of Teaching, Labor and Life in Full-time Schools" issued by the State Council, and make proper arrangements for productive labor under the principle of taking teaching as the center.

Strengthening the Party's leadership is the most important guarantee for implementing the Party's education policy. Education work must be under the leadership of the Party in order to serve the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction well. In the education revolution, colleges and universities began to establish the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the Party committee, and other schools at all levels also strengthened the Party's leadership, so that the Party's education policy was deeply implemented and achieved great results. The experience of the education revolution in the past year tells us that the Party's leadership must play the greatest role not only in political and ideological aspects, but also in teaching work and scientific research work. Political command must be adhered to in all aspects of teaching work. The clich√© that the Party "cannot lead teaching" has long been completely bankrupt. In the future, the Party's leading role in school education must be brought into play even better. We must sum up experience in practice, improve the Party's work, and improve the Party's leadership level. We must combine the Party's leadership with the broad masses, follow the mass line in teaching and scientific research work, mobilize the positive factors of the broad masses of teachers and students, eliminate the remnants of bourgeois education ideology, and lead the socialist education cause to a higher level of development.

Facts have proved that as long as we earnestly implement the Party's education policy, implement education to serve proletarian politics, combine education with productive labor, strengthen the Party's leadership over education, and implement the Party's mass line in education work, we will definitely improve the quality of teaching. The Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, implementing the policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining theory with practice, and during the year when teachers and students were sent to the countryside, they combined with relevant parties in the locality to create and reform 267 kinds of tools, 1,392 pieces. They compiled more than 4 million words of various materials, closely contacted production, carried out scientific research on a large scale, and put forward more than 40 important scientific research projects. Please see, can this be done by locking oneself in the school? Such teaching quality is incomparable to the teaching quality of the past "ignoring everything outside the window and focusing only on professional books." In the past year, the teaching quality of schools at all levels and of all types has been greatly improved. Of course, we cannot be satisfied with this, we must go to a higher level. To build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture, we need schools to continuously improve the quality of teaching and cultivate more outstanding socialist construction talents.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that for the realization of this year's continued leap forward, the main danger at present is that right-leaning opportunist thinking is growing in some cadres. It should be pointed out that in school education work, there are also such right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions in a few people. Therefore, colleges and universities and secondary schools should conscientiously study the resolutions and relevant documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Through study and debate, unify understanding, raise awareness, strengthen unity, boost revolutionary vigor, consolidate the great achievements of the education revolution in the past year, continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" that combines unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining overall planning and local decentralization, and realize the continued leap forward in education work this year!
