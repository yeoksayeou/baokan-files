The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Education Work" on September 19, 1958. This instruction, based on the experience of educational undertakings since the founding of the country and the development of the great leap forward in socialist construction, more clearly and systematically put forward our country's education policy: education serves proletarian politics, and education is combined with productive labor. It has been a whole year since then. During this period, China's education cause has undergone a profound revolution and achieved brilliant achievements.

In the past year, under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, the people of the whole country have realized the great leap forward in national economic construction and the communization of rural people's communes. Education has also adapted to the needs of the new situation and made rapid leaps forward. In the past year, the country carried out literacy work among 60 million people, and industrial, mining enterprises and people's communes established various types of spare-time schools at all levels, and the broad masses of people participated in learning. Many cities and counties across the country have basically popularized primary school education, and the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached more than 85%, with 86 million primary school students, an increase of 22.2 million over 1957, a growth of 34%; 9.9 million middle school students, an increase of 2.9 million over 1957, a growth of 41%; and 660,000 college students, an increase of 220,000 over 1957, a growth of 50%. The great development of China's education cause is beyond the reach of any capitalist country. Through the education revolution, the Party's leading position in school education has been further consolidated, and its prestige has been further enhanced. In the education revolution, schools at all levels and of all types have established factories and farms on a large scale, students have participated in productive labor, combined teaching and productive labor, strengthened labor viewpoints, transformed their thinking, and at the same time enabled students to learn knowledge actively and thoroughly. The quality of education has been improved more than in the past. Bourgeois educational ideology has been further exposed and criticized, teachers' ideological transformation has been deepened, and under the principle of teaching and learning from each other, the guiding role of teachers has been brought into play, and a democratic, equal and united cooperative teacher-student relationship has been established.

The facts of the past year further prove that the achievements of the education revolution are unprecedentedly great, and the Party's education policy is completely correct. On the first anniversary of the publication of the Party's instructions on education work, reviewing the great achievements of the past has extremely rich practical significance. Only with a correct understanding of what has been done, and a full estimate of the achievements, can we be full of confidence in the future cause and forge ahead courageously. At present, the situation on China's education front is very good. We have achieved a decisive victory in the revolution on the political and ideological front. The Party's education policy has been grasped by the broad masses of teachers and students. The teaching level of teachers and the learning quality of students are also rising step by step, and the education revolution is developing in depth. Under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, and inspired by the situation of the continued leap forward in socialist construction, we must go all out, aim high, overcome certain right-leaning conservative ideas and other erroneous ideas, and let the Party's education policy emit greater brilliance.

The facts of the past year have proved that China's education work must cultivate and educate students in accordance with the world outlook of the working class and the educational principles of socialism and communism, so as to ensure that education serves proletarian politics. We must continue to adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics. In all schools, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the political and ideological education of Marxism-Leninism, cultivate the class viewpoint of the working class among teachers and students, and oppose bourgeois viewpoints; cultivate mass viewpoints and collective viewpoints, and oppose individualism; cultivate labor viewpoints, that is, the viewpoint of combining mental labor and physical labor, and oppose the viewpoint of despising physical labor and physical laborers and advocating the separation of mental labor and physical labor; cultivate dialectical materialism viewpoints, and oppose idealism and metaphysical viewpoints. Only in this way can we cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, instead of bourgeois intellectuals who are divorced from proletarian politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality. Any neglect of systematic study of Marxist-Leninist theory and political education courses is wrong. Theory must be linked with practice, and students must participate in political movements. Schools are an organic part of social life, and schools cannot be divorced from social life and become "ivory towers." Therefore, schools should educate students in connection with the political situation, and organize students to participate in national political movements, so that students can be tempered and educated, and better serve the cause of socialist construction.

The facts of the past year have proved that education must be combined with productive labor. Students participating in productive labor to realize the laborization of intellectuals is beneficial to moral, intellectual and physical education, and it is a correct way to cultivate well-rounded new people. More than 1,400 graduates of Tsinghua University this year have strengthened their labor viewpoints, improved their political awareness, and combined with the actual needs of production through productive labor practice. The results of their graduation designs, whether in the engineering and technical problems solved in combination with production, or the scientific and technological level reached in scientific research, and the comprehensive training stipulated in the professional training goals, have exceeded those of previous years. In their graduation designs, they have completed 177 important production and scientific research tasks assigned by the state. These young students who have not yet stepped out of the school gate have completed such a huge task because they have implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor. This is a very good example. Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas are afraid that productive labor will affect teaching, so they relax or even cancel productive labor, which is obviously wrong. In all schools, productive labor must be included in the teaching plan, and students should be arranged to participate in various physical labor, or participate in productive labor in factories and farms run by schools, or go to the countryside and factories to participate in productive labor, or participate in certain social public welfare labor. Productive labor that can be combined with teaching requirements should be combined as much as possible; those that cannot be combined or cannot be directly combined must also be carried out according to the prescribed time, and the combination of teaching should not be unilaterally emphasized while ignoring productive labor. Full-time schools should conscientiously implement the "Regulations on the Arrangement of Teaching, Labor and Life in Full-time Schools" issued by the State Council, and make proper arrangements for productive labor under the principle of taking teaching as the center.

Strengthening the Party's leadership is the most important guarantee for implementing the Party's education policy. Education work must be under the leadership of the Party in order to serve the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction well. In the education revolution, colleges and universities began to establish the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the Party committee, and other schools at all levels also strengthened the Party's leadership, so that the Party's education policy was deeply implemented and achieved great results. The experience of the education revolution in the past year tells us that the Party's leadership must play the greatest role not only in political and ideological aspects, but also in teaching work and scientific research work. Political command must be adhered to in all aspects of teaching work. The cliché that the Party "cannot lead teaching" has long been completely bankrupt. In the future, the Party's leading role in school education must be brought into play even better. We must sum up experience in practice, improve the Party's work, and improve the Party's leadership level. We must combine the Party's leadership with the broad masses, follow the mass line in teaching and scientific research work, mobilize the positive factors of the broad masses of teachers and students, eliminate the remnants of bourgeois education ideology, and lead the socialist education cause to a higher level of development.

Facts have proved that as long as we earnestly implement the Party's education policy, implement education to serve proletarian politics, combine education with productive labor, strengthen the Party's leadership over education, and implement the Party's mass line in education work, we will definitely improve the quality of teaching. The Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, implementing the policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining theory with practice, and during the year when teachers and students were sent to the countryside, they combined with relevant parties in the locality to create and reform 267 kinds of tools, 1,392 pieces. They compiled more than 4 million words of various materials, closely contacted production, carried out scientific research on a large scale, and put forward more than 40 important scientific research projects. Please see, can this be done by locking oneself in the school? Such teaching quality is incomparable to the teaching quality of the past "ignoring everything outside the window and focusing only on professional books." In the past year, the teaching quality of schools at all levels and of all types has been greatly improved. Of course, we cannot be satisfied with this, we must go to a higher level. To build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture, we need schools to continuously improve the quality of teaching and cultivate more outstanding socialist construction talents.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that for the realization of this year's continued leap forward, the main danger at present is that right-leaning opportunist thinking is growing in some cadres. It should be pointed out that in school education work, there are also such right-leaning thoughts and right-leaning emotions in a few people. Therefore, colleges and universities and secondary schools should conscientiously study the resolutions and relevant documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Through study and debate, unify understanding, raise awareness, strengthen unity, boost revolutionary vigor, consolidate the great achievements of the education revolution in the past year, continue to implement the policy of "walking on two legs" that combines unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining overall planning and local decentralization, and realize the continued leap forward in education work this year!

### 进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针

    进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针
    1958年9月19日，中共中央和国务院发布了“关于教育工作的指示”。这个指示，根据建国以来教育事业的经验，根据社会主义建设大跃进形势的发展，更加明确地和系统地提出了我国的教育方针是教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。从那时以来，到现在已经整整一年了。在这期间，我国教育事业进行了深刻的革命，取得了辉煌的成就。
    在过去一年中，全国人民在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了国民经济建设的大跃进和农村人民公社化。教育事业也适应了新形势的需要，有了迅速的跃进。过去一年，全国在六千万人口中进行了扫除文盲工作，工矿企业和人民公社办了各级各类业余学校，广大人民群众参加了学习。全国许多市、县基本上普及了小学教育，全国学龄儿童入学的达到85％以上，小学生达到八千六百万人，比1957年增加二千二百万人，即增长了34％；中学生达到九百九十万人，比1957年增加二百九十万人，增长了41％；高等学校学生达到六十六万人，比1957年增加二十二万人，增长了50％。我国教育事业的大发展，是任何资本主义国家望尘莫及的。经过教育革命，党在学校教育事业中的领导地位更加巩固了，威信更加提高了。在教育革命中，各级各类学校大办工厂、农场，学生参加生产劳动，把教学、生产劳动结合起来，加强了劳动观点，改造了思想，同时还使学生把知识学活了，学透了。教育质量比过去更加提高了。资产阶级教育思想进一步受到揭露和批判，教师的思想改造更加深入了，在教学相长的原则下，发挥了教师的主导作用，树立了民主平等和团结合作的师生关系。
    一年来的事实进一步证明：教育革命的成果是空前伟大的，党的教育方针是完全正确的。在党的关于教育工作的指示公布一周年的时候，回顾过去的伟大成就，是具有极其丰富的现实意义的。只有对已经做出的事业，有了正确的认识，对成绩有充分的估计，才能对未来的事业充满信心，奋勇前进。目前，我国教育战线上的形势很好，我们在政治思想战线上的革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，党的教育方针已经为广大师生所掌握，教师的教学水平和学生的学习质量也在步步上升，教育革命正在深入发展。在社会主义建设总路线光辉的照耀下，在社会主义建设继续跃进的形势鼓舞下，我们一定要鼓足干劲，力争上游，克服某些右倾保守思想和其它错误思想，让党的教育方针发射出更大的光芒。
    一年来的事实证明，我国的教育工作，必须按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，来培养和教育学生，做到教育为无产阶级的政治服务。我们必须继续坚持教育为无产阶级的政治服务的方针。在一切学校中，今后必须继续加强马克思列宁主义的政治教育和思想教育，培养教师和学生的工人阶级的阶级观点，反对资产阶级观点；培养群众观点和集体观点，反对个人主义；培养劳动观点，即脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的观点，反对轻视体力劳动和体力劳动者、主张劳心劳力分离的观点；培养辩证唯物主义观点，反对唯心主义和形而上学的观点。只有这样，我们才能培养出有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，而不是脱离无产阶级政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的资产阶级知识分子。任何轻视系统的马克思列宁主义理论的学习，轻视政治教育课程，都是不对的。理论必须联系实际，学生必须参加政治运动。学校是社会生活的有机组成部分，学校不能脱离社会生活，变成“世外桃源”。所以，学校应当结合政治形势向学生进行教育，并且要组织学生参加全民性的政治运动，使学生从中受到锻炼，受到教育，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    一年来的事实证明，教育必须与生产劳动相结合。学生参加生产劳动，实现知识分子劳动化，不论在德育、智育和体育方面都有好处，这是培养全面发展的新人的一条正确道路。清华大学今年一千四百多名毕业生，经过了生产劳动实践，加强了劳动观点，提高了政治觉悟，结合了生产实际需要，毕业设计的成绩，不论是在结合生产解决的工程技术问题，或是科学研究达到的科学技术水平，以及在专业培养目标所规定的全面训练方面，都超过了往年。他们在毕业设计中，已经完成了一百七十七项国家交给的重要生产和科学研究的任务。这些还没有跨出校门的青年学生，由于执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，就完成了这样巨大的任务。这就是一个很好的例证。有些具有右倾保守思想的人，害怕生产劳动影响了教学，于是就放松甚至取消生产劳动，那显然是错误的。在一切学校中，必须把生产劳动列入教学计划，安排学生参加各种体力劳动，或者参加学校举办的工厂和农场中的生产劳动，或者下乡、下厂参加生产劳动，或者参加一定的社会公益劳动。生产劳动能与教学要求结合进行的，应当尽可能结合；不能结合或不能直接结合的，也必须按规定时间进行，不应片面强调结合教学而忽视生产劳动。全日制学校应该切实按照国务院发布的“关于全日制学校的教学、劳动和生活安排的规定”，在以教学为中心的原则下，把生产劳动作妥善安排。
    加强党的领导，是贯彻实行党的教育方针的最重要的保证。教育工作必须在党的领导下，才能很好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业服务。在教育革命中，各高等学校开始建立了在党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，其它各级学校也加强了党的领导，使党的教育方针深入贯彻，并且取得了巨大的成果。一年来教育革命的经验告诉我们，党的领导不仅要在政治思想上、而且也要在教学工作、科学研究工作上发挥最大的作用。在教学工作的一切环节上必须坚持政治挂帅。那种认为党“不能领导教学”的滥调早已是完全破产了。今后党在学校教育中的领导作用，还要更好地发挥。我们要在实践中总结经验，改进党的工作，提高党的领导水平。我们要把党的领导同广大群众结合起来，在教学和科学研究工作中走群众路线，调动广大师生的积极因素，消灭资产阶级教育的思想残余影响，把社会主义的教育事业引向更高发展的道路。
    事实证明，只要认真贯彻执行党的教育方针，实行教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合，加强党对教育事业的领导，在教育工作中贯彻党的群众路线，那就一定可以提高教学质量。北京农业机械化学院，贯彻教育为无产阶级的政治服务的方针，理论与实际相结合，在师生下放一年间，他们同地方上有关方面互相结合，创造和改革的工具有二百六十七种，一千三百九十二件。他们编写各种资料四百多万字，密切联系生产，大搞科学研究，提出四十多个重要的科学研究项目。请看，这是关在校门内能做到的吗？这样的教学质量比起过去的“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书”的教学质量，是不可同日而语的。一年来，各级各类学校的教学质量都有了很大的提高。当然，我们不能以此为满足，我们还要更上一层楼。我们要把我国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，就要求学校不断提高教学质量，培养出更多的优秀的社会主义建设人材。
    党的八届八中全会指出，对于实现今年的继续跃进来说，当前的主要危险是在某些干部中滋长着右倾机会主义思想。应该指出，在学校教育工作中，在少数人身上，也有这种右倾思想和右倾情绪。因此，高等学校和中等学校应该认真学习党的八届八中全会的决议和有关文件。通过学习和辩论，统一认识，提高觉悟，加强团结，鼓足革命干劲，巩固过去一年教育革命的伟大成果，继续贯彻执行统一性与多样性相结合，普及与提高相结合，全面规划与地方分权相结合的“两条腿走路”的方针，实现今年教育工作的继续跃进！
