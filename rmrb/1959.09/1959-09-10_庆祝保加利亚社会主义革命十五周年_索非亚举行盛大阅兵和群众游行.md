Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 9th: A grand military parade and a mass rally of 200,000 people were held today in Sofia's "September 9th" Square to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Bulgarian Socialist Revolution.

At dawn today, people dressed in festive attire poured into the streets and alleys near "September 9th" Square from all corners of Sofia. The entire city was filled with a festive atmosphere.

At 9:00 AM, Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and others stepped onto the reviewing stand amidst prolonged applause.

Attending today's military parade and mass rally were Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, who is currently vacationing in Bulgaria; Witold Trąmpczyński, Speaker of the Polish Parliament; a Soviet delegation headed by Ustinov, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; a delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Government of China headed by Feng Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; and a Guinean parliamentary delegation and an Iraqi military delegation, which are currently on friendly visits to Bulgaria.

General Mikhailov, the Bulgarian Minister of National Defense, reviewed the army and navy. He called on the people of the country to make persistent efforts to fulfill the glorious task of completing the Third Five-Year Plan in three or four years.

The military parade began at 9:35 AM. Leading the parade were the military academy and the army and navy contingents. Their steps were neat, and their spirit was high, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Bulgarian People's Army. At this moment, in the bright sunshine, a formation of shining jet fighters swept across the sky, receiving the review of the people of the motherland. Immediately following was the paratrooper contingent and the powerful and mighty artillery and tank divisions.

After the military parade, the mass rally began. As the contingents of workers, agricultural cooperative members, students, cadres, and citizens passed through the square, they warmly cheered the party and state leaders standing on the reviewing stand. The slogan "Long Live the Bulgarian Communist Party" rose one after another, demonstrating the people's love for the Party and the government.
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 8th: A grand gathering was held tonight at the Sofia People's Opera House to solemnly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Bulgarian Socialist Revolution.

Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, Damyanov, Traykov, and others attended the celebration.

Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Yugov, delivered a report at the meeting.

In his report, Yugov first spoke about the important significance of the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the assistance of the Soviet army, overthrowing the bourgeois-fascist autocracy and establishing people's power on September 9, 1944.

Yugov then spoke about the brilliant achievements Bulgaria has made in socialist construction over the past fifteen years since liberation.

Yugov pointed out that the leap forward movement in the national economy that Bulgaria began in November last year has achieved great results. He pointed out that in the first half of this year, the industrial production plan was completed by 101.4%, producing about 24% more products than in the same period last year.

Yugov emphasized that the fact that Bulgaria's national economic leap forward movement has achieved great results most convincingly demonstrates that the Bulgarian Communist Party's economic leap forward program is practical and feasible. It shows that Bulgaria's socialist national economy has enormous potential and possibilities for development, and it resolutely refutes pessimists and skeptics.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, Yugov expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union and other socialist countries for their fraternal, sincere, and selfless assistance in Bulgaria's socialist construction.

When talking about the international situation, Yugov said that Bulgaria's international prestige is constantly growing, and because of its pursuit of a peace-loving foreign policy, it has become an active factor for peace and security in the Balkans.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Ustinov, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating Bulgaria on the 15th anniversary of its National Day.

    阅兵分列式在九时三十五分开始。走在最前面的是军事学院和陆海军的队伍，他们步伐整齐，精神焕发，表现出了保加利亚人民军队的英雄气概。这时，在灿烂的阳光中，闪闪发光的喷气歼击机群掠空而过，接受祖国人民的检阅。紧接着通过广场的是伞兵部队和强大威武的炮兵和坦克部队。
    阅兵结束后，开始了群众游行。工人、农业生产合作社社员、学生、干部、市民的队伍通过广场时，向站在检阅台上的党和国家领导人热烈欢呼。“保加利亚共产党万岁”的口号声此起彼落，显示了人民群众对党和政府的爱戴。
