Dear Comrades!

On this day of great significance to the Chinese working people and the entire international workers' revolutionary movement—the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—we extend to you the warm, comradely greetings of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Government, and the working people of the entire nation, and our congratulations on your grand festival. The working people of Czechoslovakia share your joy at this festive moment and express their profound sympathy and admiration for the achievements of the heroic Chinese people. Feelings of proletarian internationalism and the common ideal of building socialism and communism connect us with the Chinese people.

The internationalist friendship between our two peoples is based on the long-standing tradition of comradely solidarity that exists between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak working people have always stood wholeheartedly on the side of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and have followed with concern the glorious revolutionary development of the Chinese people.

The realization of the legacy of the Great October Socialist Revolution unites the Communist Parties and the peoples of our two countries. The revolutionary flames of the October Socialist Revolution pointed out to the people of all countries the path to a new life, the path to national and social liberation. The revolutionary experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of key significance for the victory of socialist construction in fraternal countries and the growth of the strength of the socialist camp. The existence of the socialist camp is the greatest achievement of the contemporary international revolutionary workers' movement.

The People's Republic of China, together with all socialist countries, is marching shoulder to shoulder towards socialism and communism on the same front. Every socialist country is making its own contribution to this. The invincible source of the socialist camp and the guarantee of the inevitable victory of socialism and communism worldwide lie in the unity of the socialist countries, in their unbreakable relationship with the Soviet Union, and in the continuous growth of their economic strength.

The Chinese Communists have taken the ever-youthful teachings of the great October as the effective basis of their revolutionary path, the realization of which has led the Chinese people into the most glorious stage of their history. The magnificent achievements of the Chinese Communist Party's revolutionary path show that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the third most significant milestone in modern human history after the Great October of 1917 and the Soviet Army's victory over fascism in World War II.

The victory of the Chinese people has further greatly strengthened the cause of world socialism. The ten years since the founding of the People's China is indeed a short period in the long history of the Chinese people, but its significance and achievements surpass an entire century. These ten years have shown that under the people's regime and the conditions of socialist construction, and under the fraternal cooperation of socialist countries, the strength and national wealth of every socialist country are guaranteed to grow rapidly. The Czechoslovak working people watch with admiration and praise the construction drive and enthusiasm of the Chinese people, who are rapidly improving their cultural and educational level and realizing the great tasks of socialist construction ahead of schedule.

We wish the entire Chinese people to advance victoriously in the great cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party.

Comrades, please allow me to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the more than two million visitors to the recently concluded Brno Machinery Fair, our sincere admiration and congratulations to you, to your workers and technicians, for the high level of your exhibits. Your exhibited machines have aroused surprise and praise even among representatives of capitalist countries. At the same time, our working people are very excited about the rapid rise of your industry.

The unprecedented speed of China's economic development, which your Party describes as the Great Leap Forward, proves that socialism has unlimited possibilities for ensuring the development of productive forces. The establishment and consolidation of people's communes based on socialist principles promotes the realization of the magnificent task of solving the peasant problem, because the people's communes are smoothly solving the problem of the Chinese peasants' transition to socialist production relations.

The revolutionary victory of the Chinese people ten years ago, the great achievements in the economic, social and cultural fields in the past few years, and the continuous consolidation of political and spiritual unity—all these achievements were achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and they have greatly promoted the development of the national liberation movement.

The people of all countries praise the policies of the People's Republic of China, which have contributed to the formulation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles have become a driving force for the anti-imperialist struggle and the foundation for mutual relations between the vast majority of Asian and African countries established in the spirit of Bandung. This program of struggle for peace and against imperialist national liberation movement remains a matter of urgency, and no one can weaken it because it is in the interests of the people and all countries. As long as colonialism and imperialism still exist in the world, this program of struggle will always play a role.

The Chinese Communist Party's active contribution to strengthening the strength of the socialist camp and the unity of the international working class revolutionary movement is also highly praised. Not long ago, when imperialism attempted to use the Trojan horse of revisionism to undermine the unity between socialist countries, the irreconcilable principled stand taken by People's China effectively isolated and crushed the danger of revisionism. The voice of the Chinese Communist Party carries great weight and makes a significant contribution to the unity of world revolutionary forces. The ideological program of world revolutionary forces is the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

Comrades, the Czechoslovak people have achieved great successes on their own path, which have brought a new socialist face to the Czechoslovak Republic.

Our people are implementing the resolutions of the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The Congress has defined the program of completing socialist construction as the immediate goal of our people. The Czechoslovak working people are fully aware that the tasks they are participating in with unprecedented enthusiasm and initiative are of far-reaching historical significance, because these tasks not only include the establishment of socialism, but also mean the new development of an advanced socialist society in Czechoslovakia. These great tasks are all contained in the draft of the third five-year plan for the national economic development of the Czechoslovak Republic from 1960 to 1965. For example, industrial output in 1965 will increase to six times that of our country under bourgeois rule in 1937. This will mean that our country will surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of the output of the most important industrial products per capita.

In our rural areas, we have also achieved the historic victory of socialism; now we are paying full attention to utilizing the possibilities and advantages of large-scale socialist agricultural production. The development of our country's productive forces is inseparable from the increasing participation of our working people in economic management and state management. The development of our country's productive forces also continuously improves the people's living standards. Great progress has also been made in resolutely completing the tasks of the cultural revolution. This progress helps to raise the socialist consciousness of the working people.

The internationalist unity of the socialist camp and the consolidated world revolutionary forces is a great support for us.

We know that it is only thanks to the friendship and comradely assistance of the Soviet Union, and thanks to the consolidated unity and cooperation of the socialist countries, that we have been able to achieve success on the road to completing socialist construction.
The great goals set by the socialist camp convincingly express its deep concern for maintaining peace. Recently, the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union have achieved significant successes in the struggle for peace. The idea of peaceful coexistence has taken deep root in the minds of hundreds of millions of people around the world, and has become a force that the leaders of the capitalist world cannot ignore.

Therefore, we cannot fail to mention the great significance and far-reaching influence of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which showed mankind the peaceful path and new prospects for peaceful coexistence among nations. The Congress pointed out the possibility of preventing war and the path of peaceful competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system. Four years of experience have proved that this is a feasible and correct path, and the vast majority of mankind fully agrees to take this path.

Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and the Soviet government's disarmament proposal he put forward to the United Nations are of far-reaching significance and can serve as the basis for establishing a peaceful international cooperation system, eliminating all wars from the lives of the people of all countries and ensuring lasting peace for mankind. The response to this proposal proves that it was put forward in accordance with the urgent desire of the vast majority of mankind to maintain and consolidate peace.

The great ideas of Marxism-Leninism are successively winning victories, and the day is not far off when the socialist system will completely defeat the capitalist system.

May the friendship between the people of People's China and Czechoslovakia, based on the lofty principles of proletarian internationalism, develop and consolidate!

May the great cause of socialist construction in China, led by the Chinese Communist Party, be victoriously completed!

Glory to the invincible socialist camp, led by the great Soviet Union, the bastion of the bright future of the people of the world!

    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷克斯洛伐克共和国党政代表团团长
    安·诺沃提尼同志的贺词亲爱的同志们！
    在对中国劳动人民和整个国际工人革命运动具有十分重大意义的日子——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十周年的日子里，我们向你们转达捷克斯洛伐克共产党、捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会、政府和全国劳动人民的热烈的、同志般的敬礼和对你们重大节日的祝贺。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在这个欢庆的时刻同你们一起感到欢欣鼓舞，并对英勇的中国人民所获得的成就表示深厚的同情和敬佩。无产阶级国际主义的感情和建设社会主义、共产主义的共同理想把我们同中国人民连接在一起。
    我们两国人民之间的国际主义友谊是基于中国共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党之间所存在的同志般团结的悠久传统。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民一向全心全意地站在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下的中国人民的英勇斗争这一方面，并曾关切地注视中国人民光荣的革命发展。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命遗训的实现，使我们两国的共产党和两国人民结合在一起。十月社会主义革命的革命火焰向各国人民指出了走向新生活的道路，指出了走向民族解放和社会解放的道路。苏联共产党的革命经验对于各兄弟国家社会主义建设的胜利和社会主义阵营力量的增长有着关键性的意义。社会主义阵营的存在是当代国际革命工人运动的最伟大的成果。
    中华人民共和国同所有的社会主义国家正在同一条战线上肩并肩地向社会主义和共产主义迈进。对此，每一个社会主义国家正在作出自己的贡献。社会主义阵营不可战胜的泉源和社会主义、共产主义在全世界范围内必获得胜的保证就在于社会主义国家的团结一致，在于它们同苏联的牢不可破的关系以及它们经济力量的不断增长。
    中国共产党人把永葆青春的伟大十月的教导作为自己革命道路的卓有成效的基础，这个教导的实现使中国人民进入了自己历史上的最光辉的阶段。中国共产党革命道路的宏伟成果表明，中国革命的胜利是继1917年伟大的十月和第二次世界大战苏军战胜法西斯之后现代人类历史上第三个最有意义的里程碑。
    中国人民的胜利进一步大大地加强了世界社会主义的事业。人民中国成立的十年在中国人民悠久的历史中的确是个很短的时期，但是它的意义和成就却超过了整个世纪。这十个年头表明，在人民政权和建设社会主义的条件下，在社会主义各国兄弟般合作的条件下每一个社会主义国家的力量和民族财富都有了迅速增长的保证。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民怀着钦佩和赞扬的心情注视着中国人民的建设干劲和热情，他们正以飞跃的速度提高自己的文化教育程度和提前实现社会主义建设的伟大任务。
    我们愿全中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设的伟大事业中胜利前进。
    同志们，请允许我借这个机会在这里代表不久前闭幕的布尔诺机器博览会的二百余万观众向你们，向你们的工人和技术人员，为你们展品的高度水平表示真诚的敬佩和祝贺。你们展出的机器就在资本主义国家的代表人物当中也引起了惊奇和赞扬，同时，我国劳动人民对你们工业的迅速高涨感到十分兴奋。
    你们党所描述为大跃进的中国经济发展的空前速度证明，社会主义对于保证生产力的发展具有无限的可能性。建立在社会主义原则之上的人民公社的建立和巩固促进着解决农民问题的宏伟任务的实现，因为人民公社正顺利地解决着中国农民过渡到建设社会主义的生产关系的道路问题。
    中国人民十年前的革命胜利，过去几年中在经济、社会和文化方面的伟大成就以及在政治上精神上的团结的不断巩固所有这些成就都是在中国共产党领导下获得的，它们在很大程度上推动了民族解放运动的发展。
    各国人民盛赞中华人民共和国的政策，它对和平共处五项原则的提出作出了贡献，五项原则已经成为反帝斗争的推动力量和绝大多数亚非国家之间按照万隆精神建立起来的相互关系的基础。这个争取和平和反对帝国主义的民族解放运动的斗争纲领仍然是当务之急，没有任何人能够削弱它，因为它符合人民和所有国家的利益。只要殖民主义和帝国主义仍然在世界上存在，这个斗争纲领将始终发生作用。
    中国共产党对加强社会主义阵营的力量和国际工人阶级革命运动的团结所作出的积极贡献，同样受到人们的推崇。不久以前当帝国主义企图利用修正主义的特洛伊木马来破坏社会主义国家间的团结的时候，人民中国所采取的不调和的原则立场极其有效地孤立和粉碎修正主义的危险。中国共产党的呼声有着巨大的分量，并且对世界革命力量的团结作出了重大的贡献。世界革命力量的思想纲领是共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言的原则。
    同志们，捷克斯洛伐克人民在自己的道路上取得了伟大的成就，这些成就为捷克斯洛伐克共和国带来了新的社会主义的面貌。
    我国人民正在实现捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会的决议。代表大会把完成社会主义建设的纲领确定为我国人民最近的目标。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民充分意识到，他们以空前的积极性和首创精神来参与完成的任务，是具有深远的历史意义的，因为这些任务既包含建立起社会主义，也意味着先进的社会主义社会在捷克斯洛伐克的新发展。这些伟大的任务都包含在捷克斯洛伐克共和国1960年到1965年国民经济发展的第三个五年计划的草案中。例如，工业产量在1965年将增长到我国在资产阶级统治下的1937年的六倍。这将意味着我国在最重要的工业产品按人口计算的产量方面将超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    在我国农村里，我们也取得了社会主义的历史性的胜利；现在我们正充分注意利用社会主义农业大生产的可能性和优越性。我国生产力的发展是同我国劳动人民日益参与经济管理和国家管理分不开的。我国生产力的发展也使人民的生活水平不断提高。在坚决完成文化革命的任务方面，也取得了巨大进展。这种进展有助于提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟。
    社会主义阵营和世界革命力量巩固的国际主义的团结一致，是对我们巨大的支持。
    我们知道，由于苏联的友谊和同志般的援助，由于社会主义国家的巩固团结和合作，我们才有可能在完成社会主义建设的道路上取得成就。     社会主义阵营给自己提出的伟大目标令人信服地表达了它对维护和平的深切关怀。近来，以苏联为首的社会主义国家在争取和平的斗争中取得了重大的成就。和平共处的思想已经在全世界亿万人民的思想中深深地扎下了根，并且已经成为资本主义世界的领导人物不能不重视的力量。
    因此，我们不能不提到苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议的巨大意义和深远影响，它向人类展示了各国人民的和平道路与和平共处的新前景。代表大会指出了防止战争的可能性和社会主义体系同资本主义体系进行和平竞赛的道路。四年来的经验证明，这是一条可行的和正确的道路，人类绝大多数都完全同意走这条道路。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在美国的访问和他向联合国提出的苏联政府的裁军建议，具有深远意义，是可以作为建立和平的国际合作体系的基础，可以从各国人民的生活中消除一切战争并保证人类的持久和平。这一建议所得到的反应，证明了它是根据人类绝大多数对维护和巩固和平的迫切愿望提出的。
    马克思列宁主义的伟大思想正接连地取得胜利，社会主义制度彻底战胜资本主义制度的日子已经不远了。
    愿人民中国和捷克斯洛伐克两国人民以无产阶级国际主义崇高原则为基础的友谊发展和巩固！
    愿中国共产党领导的中国社会主义建设的伟大事业胜利完成！
    光荣归于全世界人民光辉未来的堡垒——以伟大苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营！（附图片）
