    Revolution is Not Embroidery
  　Yang Huan
    Right-leaning opportunists slander last year's mass steelmaking campaign as "a mess." One of their "arguments" is: "Aren't we using 'small modern groups' to make steel now? Aren't we excluding native steel production from the national plan? If so, why did we engage in 'small native groups' on a large scale last year? Isn't that wasteful? Isn't that taking a detour?" It sounds very reasonable, even with a hint of anti-waste!
    I can't help but think of a "Triple-Story Building Analogy" in the Hundred Parables Sutra, which has a similar flavor to these right-leaning opportunists. The story tells of a wealthy man who was building a new three-story house. When he saw the craftsmen erecting pillars and laying bricks on the ground, he became impatient and quickly stepped forward to stop them: "I only want to build the top floor, not the bottom two floors. Just build the top floor for me. Isn't it a waste to start from the ground?"
    Such people often think they are extremely clever, "brilliant Marxists," and that others are fools, with "petty-bourgeois fanaticism." But the more of these clever people there are, the more dangerous they are to our cause.
    The transition from "small native groups" to "small modern groups" is a process of development. If it weren't for the mass steelmaking campaign, if tens of millions of people hadn't gone up the mountains, how could we have developed "small modern groups" with unclear geological resources, insufficient technical strength, and inadequate mechanical equipment? Where would the eight million tons of good steel and more than three million tons of native steel from last year have come from?
    However, they have another trump card, which is "there are losses and gains," or "the gains do not outweigh the losses," meaning: mobilizing the masses is of course possible, but doing it this way is too chaotic, too wasteful, too "uneconomical," and so on.
    Look how well they calculate. Unfortunately, they are calculating with a small business mentality, not with the mentality of socialist construction. Take the mass steelmaking campaign as an example. This was actually a great revolution. Tens of millions of people went up the mountains, tens of millions of people stood in front of small blast furnaces, to revolutionize the fate of economic backwardness. And revolution, it is not like girls doing embroidery, meticulously arranging each stitch. It is a grand mass movement, and once it starts, it is like a thousand sails racing and ten thousand horses galloping. There will of course be unevenness and shortcomings in the process, but this is a revolution, a great cause of hundreds of millions of people! As Lenin said: "Revolution cannot be like a tailor measuring clothes, measuring seven times and cutting once." Revolution is consolidated and developed in the process of practice.
    Moreover, even if we calculate according to their standards, it is not a case of "the gains not outweighing the losses." Premier Zhou, in his "Report on Adjusting the Main Targets of the 1959 National Economic Plan and Further Developing the Movement to Increase Production and Practice Economy," has already calculated this account clearly. As the report says: "If we only adopted the method of building large blast furnaces, in such a short period of time, due to various limitations, even if we spent the same or even more investment, it would never have been possible to produce so much pig iron in five years."
    It can be seen that those right-leaning opportunists are not really trying to calculate. In the final analysis, they are opposed to the revolutionary movement of the masses. Those people who want to treat revolution as embroidery, who want to shout "there are losses and gains" and "the gains do not outweigh the losses," are actually trying to tie the hands and feet of the masses, to make the masses advance like women with bound feet. How can such a bourgeois-master attitude be tolerated by the socialist construction heroes who are full of vigor?

    革命不是绣花
  　杨焕
    右倾机会主义分子s诬蔑去年全民大炼钢铁是“搞糟了”，“论据”之一，就是：“现在不是采用‘小洋群’来炼钢铁了吗？现在不是不把土钢的生产列入国家的计划之内了吗？既然如此，去年何必大搞‘小土群’？岂不是浪费？岂不是走弯路？”听起来好像很有道理，还有点反浪费的味道哩！
    我不禁想起百喻经里有一段“三重楼喻”，同这些右倾机会主义者的味道倒有点相近。那故事说一个富翁大兴土木，要盖一幢三层楼的新房。当他看见工匠在地面上立柱砌砖的时候，就焦躁起来，连忙上前阻拦：“我只要造那最上一层，不要下面两层，你就给我盖那最上一层就行了，从平地造起，不是浪费吗？”
    这样的人，常常自以为为聪明绝顶，是“高明的马克思主义者”，别人都是傻瓜，都是“小资产阶级狂热性”。可是这种聪明的人愈多，对我们的事业愈是危险。
    从“小土群”到“小洋群”，本来是一个发展的过程。如果不是全民大炼钢铁，不是几千万人上山，我们怎么可能在地质资源不明、技术力量不足、机械设备不够的情况下发展“小洋群”，去年的八百万吨好钢和三百多万吨土钢又从何而来？
    然而他们还有一张王牌，那就是：“有失有得”，或“得不偿失”，意思就是：发动群众当然也可以，但是这样搞法，就太乱了，太浪费了，太“划不来”了，等等。
    你瞧，他们多会打算盘。可惜他们打的是小本经营的算盘，不是社会主义建设的算盘。就拿全民大炼钢铁这件事来说，这其实是一场大革命。几千万人上山，几千万人站在小高炉前，要革经济落后之命。而革命，它不是姑娘们绣花，可以一针一线细细摆弄，它是轰轰烈烈的群众运动，一声起来，就如千帆竞发，万马奔腾。这中间当然会有参差，也会有缺点，但这是革命，是亿万人的大事业！正如列宁说过的：“革命不能像裁缝量衣服，量七次，裁一次。”革命，正是在实践的过程中得到巩固和发展的。
    何况，即使按他们的算盘打，也不是“得不偿失”。周总理在“关于调整一九五九年国民经济计划主要指标和进一步开展增产节约运动的报告”里，已经把这笔账算得清清楚楚。正像报告里说的：“如果我们只采取建设大高炉的办法，在这样短的时间内，由于受着各种条件的限制，即使花同样的乃至更多的投资，也决不可能在五年内生产出这样多的生铁。”
    可见得，那些右倾机会主义者，他们并不是真的要算账，归根结蒂，他们是反对群众的革命运动。他们这些要把革命当作绣花，要想叫嚷着“有失有得”、“得不偿失”的人，实际上是想缚住群众的手足，要群众像小脚女人似地前进。这种资产阶级老爷式的态度，岂是气贯长虹的社会主义建设英雄们所能忍受的么？
