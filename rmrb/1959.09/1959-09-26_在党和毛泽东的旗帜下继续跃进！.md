Continue the Great Leap Forward Under the Banner of the Party and Mao Zedong!
Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy

　　The Chinese people are jubilantly celebrating their great festival - the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the short span of ten years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the hardworking and brave Chinese people have certainly taken a giant leap in the development of social history, begun to change the backward state of poverty and blankness that has existed in the motherland for thousands of years, and firmly embarked on the socialist road of happiness, prosperity and strength. At the same time, they have set an example for all oppressed nations and backward countries in the world, and are a strong new force in maintaining world peace and security.

　　How did we get through this journey? Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have carried out creative and heroic labor in these ten years, demonstrated great perseverance and wisdom, constantly fought and revolutionized on all fronts, and continuously created amazing achievements. The great victories of the three major movements of land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, basically liberated the productive forces of the vast rural areas, stabilized domestic social order, and enhanced China's international status, creating favorable conditions for further implementing socialist transformation and socialist construction. The Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements and the ideological remolding movement began to unfold the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads on the economic and ideological-political fronts. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement further purged the remaining hidden counter-revolutionary forces in the country. The high tide of the three major transformations in 1956 basically completed the socialist transformation of the national economy, laying a solid foundation for carrying out large-scale socialist construction throughout the country. The rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957 won a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialist construction, and creating a political situation in the country where there was both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual ease of mind and liveliness.

　　It was on this basis that the Party and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" in 1958. Under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line, the people of the whole country emancipated their minds, broke down superstitions, were full of vigor, and their enthusiasm soared to the sky, setting off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the movement of people's communes, which were characterized by being large in size and collective in nature. This enabled China's national economy and cultural and educational undertakings to achieve unprecedented leaps forward. The three vigorous new things that have emerged on the land of China – the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes – have proven to possess unparalleled and powerful vitality. The endless and concentrated curses and slanders of imperialism and reactionaries against these new things show how frightened they are in the face of China's great new things, thus expressing their deep-seated hatred. This also shows that we have done things completely right. As we celebrate the great tenth anniversary of the founding of our country, the people of the whole country must, under the fighting call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, firmly grasp the banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and forge ahead courageously. The Chinese people are fully confident that they will be able to complete the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in terms of major industrial and agricultural products this year, and that they will be able to realize the slogan of "catching up with the level of England in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years" in about ten years, and at the same time, it is possible to greatly advance and overfulfill the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program. We have already and will continue to use ironclad facts to smash the enemy's attacks, slanders, and curses. Newborn revolutionary forces have always grown and strengthened irresistibly amidst the enemy's slanders, curses, and attacks.

　　In the history of the development of human society and in the history of the development of our country's society, ten years is but a short period of time. However, in these short ten years, the political and economic face of our motherland, the lives, thoughts, and social relations of our people, and our national relations and international status have all undergone fundamental and thorough changes. The achievement of this astonishing result cannot but be attributed to the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. After the Party and Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to remove the three great mountains weighing on their heads and established the People's Republic of China, they continued to creatively combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the actual conditions of China, adhered to putting politics in command in socialist transformation and socialist construction, adhered to the working method of the mass line, fully mobilized the masses in various movements, strengthened the leadership of the Party, eliminated all material and ideological obstacles, mobilized all positive factors, and united all forces that could be united. When the strong leadership of the Party is integrated with the determination and wisdom of the masses, it transforms into an invincible force that makes high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. The Party has always adopted the policy of unity, education, and transformation towards intellectuals. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, starting from land reform, the Party has regularly allowed intellectuals to go to various mass movements to study and train themselves. With the leap forward development of our country's national economy and cultural and educational undertakings in socialist transformation and socialist construction, the face of our country's intellectuals has also greatly changed. On the one hand, batches of new intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds have emerged; on the other hand, bourgeois intellectuals have also been transformed to varying degrees through various movements and business practices, serving the socialist cause in various positions. The members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy are mostly middle-aged and elderly teachers in primary and secondary schools, and the rest are intellectuals who work in various cultural and educational institutions or government agencies. In the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party, the organizations at all levels of our association have promoted members and the masses they are connected with to actively serve in their work posts, participate in various social activities and mass movements, study the Party's guidelines and policies and Marxist-Leninist theory, and have done some work and achieved certain results. However, we also deeply realize that the transformation of bourgeois intellectuals is a long-term, repeated, and complex process. After the anti-rightist and rectification campaigns, our members generally made up their minds to embark on a new stage of conscious self-transformation in re-understanding themselves and recognizing the requirements of objective development laws and the situation for intellectuals. At present, under the leadership of the Party, the organizations at all levels of our association are conscientiously implementing the policy of combining service and transformation, continuing to transform themselves in active service, going deep into the grassroots, cultivating typical examples, resolutely relying on the leadership of the Party committees of their units in their work, closely combining with the central tasks of the country and various units, grasping ideology in a thorough and meticulous manner, taking the initiative and actively doing their work, and organizing grassroots work and member ideological transformation reporting meetings in various places to exchange experiences and promote each other, conduct positive education for members, mobilize positive factors, and serve the socialist cause more and better.

　　New China is about to enter its second great decade, and our country's socialist construction will have a larger scale and more rapid development. The domestic and international situation is very favorable to us. Domestically, under the fighting call and encouragement of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to oppose rightism, boost morale, and further carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the people of all nationalities across the country are working together with one heart and one mind, uniting as one, and carrying out socialist competition movements on all fronts in a galloping manner. Internationally, the Soviet lunar rocket passed through the clouds and reached the lunar palace, the Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker began to advance towards the thick ice layers of the Arctic Ocean, and Chairman Khrushchev also went to the United States to carry out preliminary work to melt the "Cold War" ice. The bugle of peace resounded through the sky, and the noise of imperialism and its lackeys was completely drowned out. This shows that peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition are the will of the people and the general trend. Of course, the "Cold War" forces of imperialism are still alive and are still doing everything possible to carry out sabotage. We must be highly vigilant about this, but we believe that under the dominance of the socialist forces of the world over the imperialist forces, peace will surely defeat war and justice will surely defeat aggression. The decisive stage of the peaceful competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism has begun. We firmly believe that socialism will surely defeat capitalism. At this great moment, living in China today, we feel无比荣耀无比荣耀 and also feel the great responsibility. We intellectuals must always listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, conscientiously do our job well, study Marxism-Leninism, Chairman Mao's works, and the Party's guidelines and policies, participate in labor training, continue to transform ourselves in active service, and together with the workers and peasants of the whole country, with soaring spirit and intense labor, hold high the banner of the Party and Mao Zedong, continue to leap forward, to meet the greater and more rapid task of building socialism in the second great decade of our great People's Republic of China!

### 在党和毛泽东的旗帜下继续跃进！

    在党和毛泽东的旗帜下继续跃进！
    中国民主促进会副主席　王绍鏊
    中国人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝自己的伟大节日——中华人民共和国成立十周年。在短短的十年间，勤劳勇敢的中国人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会历史发展上已经肯定地跃进了一大步，开始改变祖国千百年来一穷二白的落后状态，坚定地走上了幸福、繁荣、富强的社会主义道路，同时给世界上所有被压迫民族和落后国家树立了榜样，对于维护世界和平和安全是一支实力雄厚的生力军。
    我们是怎样走过这一段历程的呢？在共产党和毛主席的领导下，中国人民在这十年间进行了创造性的英勇劳动，发挥了高度的毅力和智慧，在各个战线上不断战斗和革命，不断创造惊人的业迹。土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝三大运动的巨大胜利，基本上解放了广大农村的生产力，安定了国内的社会秩序，提高了我国的国际地位，为进一步实行社会主义改造和社会主义建设创造了有利的条件。三反五反和思想改造运动开始展开了经济战线上和思想政治战线上社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。肃反运动进一步肃清了国内残存的隐藏的反革命势力。1956年的三大改造高潮基本上完成了国民经济的社会主义改造，为在全国范围内大规模开展社会主义建设奠立了巩固的基础。1957年的整风反右运动又在政治战线上和思想战线上取得社会主义革命的决定性胜利，调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务，使全国出现了又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。
    就在这样的基础上，党和毛主席在1958年提出了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民解放思想，破除迷信，意气风发，干劲冲天，掀起了社会主义建设大跃进的高潮，出现了一大二公的人民公社运动，使我国国民经济和文化教育各项事业都获得了史无前例的飞跃发展。在中国大地上出现的总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三个生气勃勃的新事物，已证明具有无比强大的生命力。从帝国主义和反动派对这些新事物的无休止地集中咒诅和谩骂，说明了它们在中国伟大的新事物面前如何的胆战心惊，因而表现了刻骨的仇恨。这也说明我们把事情完全做对了。在我们庆祝伟大的建国十周年的时候，我们全国人民，更要在党的八届八中全会的战斗号召和鼓舞下，牢牢掌握总路线、大跃进和人民公社的旗帜，奋勇前进。我国人民完全有信心能够在今年内在主要工农业产品方面提前三年完成第二个五年计划的指标，能够在十年左右的时间内实现“在十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国水平”的口号，同时有可能大大提前超额完成十二年农业发展纲要。我们已经和还要用铁的事实粉碎敌人的攻击谩骂和咒诅。新生的革命力量从来就是在敌人的诽谤、咒诅和攻击中，不可阻挡地成长和壮大起来的。
    在人类社会的发展史上，在我国社会的发展史上，十年，不过是短暂的一段时间。但是就在这短短的十年间，我们祖国的政治经济面貌，我国人民的生活、思想和社会关系，我国的民族关系和国际地位，都起了根本的彻底的变化。这种惊人成绩的取得，不能不归功于伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导。党和毛主席领导我国人民把压在头上的三座大山搬走，成立了中华人民共和国之后，继续创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国实际结合起来，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中坚持政治挂帅，坚持群众路线的工作方法，在各项运动中充分发动群众，加强党的领导，扫除一切物质上和思想上的障碍，调动一切积极的因素，团结一切可以团结的力量。当党的坚强领导同群众的决心和智慧融合在一起的时候，就化成一种无敌的力量，使高山也要低头，河水也要让路。党对知识分子一贯采取团结、教育、改造的方针。在中华人民共和国成立之后，从土地改革开始，党就经常让知识分子到各项群众运动中去学习和锻炼。随着我国国民经济和文化教育各项事业的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的飞跃发展，我国知识分子的面貌也大大改变了。一方面，一批批的工农出身的新知识分子出现了；另一方面，资产阶级知识分子通过各项运动和业务实践，也得到不同程度的改造，在各种不同岗位上为社会主义事业服务。中国民主促进会的成员以中小学中老年教师占多数，其余也是在各类文教机关或政府机关服务的知识分子。十年以来，我会各级组织在党的领导下，推动会员和所联系的群众在工作岗位上积极服务、参加各种社会活动和群众运动、学习党的方针政策和马克思列宁主义理论，做了一些工作，取得一定的成绩。但是，我们也深深地体会到，资产阶级知识分子的改造是一个长期的、反复的、复杂的过程。经过反右和整风，我们的成员一般都能下决心在重新认识自己，认清客观发展规律和形势对知识分子的要求中，开始走上自觉的自我改造的新阶段。目前我会各级组织在党的领导下，正在认真地执行服务与改造相结合、在积极服务中继续改造的方针，深入基层，培养典型，在工作中坚决依靠所在单位党委的领导，密切结合全国的和各单位的中心任务，深入细致地抓思想，主动积极地做工作，并在各地组织基层工作和成员思想改造汇报会，交流经验，相互促进，对会员进行正面教育，调动积极因素，更多更好地为社会主义事业服务。
    新中国即将进入第二个伟大的十年，我国的社会主义建设将有更大规模更迅速的发展，国内和国际的形势对我们都是非常有利的。在国内，全国各族人民在党的八届八中全会的反右倾、鼓干劲和进一步开展增产节约运动的战斗号召和鼓舞之下，正在同心同德，团结一致，在各个战线上以万马奔腾的形势开展社会主义竞赛运动。在国际，苏联月球火箭穿过云层到达了月宫，苏联的原子破冰船开始向北冰洋的厚冰层进军，赫鲁晓夫主席也到美国进行了融化“冷战”冰块的初步工作。和平的号角响彻云霄，帝国主义及其走狗的噪音被完全盖过了。这说明了和平共处与和平竞赛已是人心所向，大势所趋。当然，帝国主义的“冷战”势力还活着，还在千方百计地进行破坏，我们对此不能不提高警惕，但我们相信，在世界社会主义力量压倒帝国主义势力的优势下，和平必将战胜战争，正义必将战胜侵略。社会主义和资本主义两个体系和平竞赛的决定性阶段开始了。我们坚信社会主义一定可以比垮资本主义。在这个伟大的时刻，生在今天的中国，我们感到无比的光荣，也觉得责任的重大。我们知识分子要永远听党的话，听毛主席的话，认真做好岗位工作，努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛主席的著作和党的方针政策，参加劳动锻炼，在积极服务中继续改造，同全国的工人和农民一道，以冲天的气概和紧张的劳动，高举党和毛泽东的旗帜，继续跃进，来迎接我们伟大的中华人民共和国第二个伟大的十年的更大规模和更迅速地建设社会主义的伟大任务！
