Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 4th: Wang Fengen, a well-known labor model and engineer from the Shenyang Transformer Factory, along with the technical innovation team he leads, recently completed six technical innovation projects in six days, breaking through the bottleneck of insufficient manpower in manufacturing high-voltage bushings.

While the factory's employees were enthusiastically studying the documents of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the insulation workshop received an important batch of high-voltage bushing tasks. Completing this task required an additional five thousand work hours. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party branch, Wang Fengen led the technical innovation team to meticulously arrange a plan to vigorously innovate and break through key problems: to strive to complete this important task on schedule or ahead of schedule by realizing the mechanization of high-voltage bushing production. Wang Fengen himself selected the innovation project of changing manual pipe sawing to automation. This innovation can be said to be the key of keys, because the wound bakelite tubes need to have both ends trimmed evenly. If relying solely on manual operation, it would be impossible to complete the task. Wang Fengen pondered this problem deeply and, after seven or eight trials and re-trials, finally developed an automatic pipe cutting device. He installed the automatic pipe cutting device on the tube winding machine. As the tube winding machine rotates, the ends of the bakelite tube are also cut evenly. As a result, the pipe cutting process no longer requires any workers.

While researching the automatic pipe cutting device, Wang Fengen also helped other members of the technical innovation team to realize five technical innovation projects, such as a jointing machine and a double-tube winding machine. Each innovation improved production efficiency by more than double the original rate.

Wang Fengen is an engineer of worker origin who has grown up under the cultivation of the Party. In the past eight years, he has implemented a total of more than 230 technical innovations, transforming his insulation workshop from entirely manual operation to more than 70% mechanized production. Now, he is leading the technical innovation team to continue research, striving to achieve the mechanization of the electrician process before National Day.

### 工程师王凤恩带头攻关键  他和技术革新大队一起六天实现六项革新项目

    工程师王凤恩带头攻关键
    他和技术革新大队一起六天实现六项革新项目
    据新华社沈阳4日电　沈阳市著名劳动模范、沈阳变压器厂工程师王凤恩，同他所领导的技术革新大队一起，在最近六天之内实现了六项技术革新项目，突破了制造高压套管人力不足的关键。
    正当这个厂职工热烈学习党的八届八中全会文件的时候，绝缘车间接受了一批高压套管的重要任务。要完成这个任务，缺少五千个工时。王凤恩于是在党支部领导下，带领技术革新大队详细地安排了一个闹革新、破关键的计划：用实现生产高压套管机械化的方法，争取按期或提前完成这项重要任务。王凤恩自己挑选了将手工锯管改成自动化的革新项目。这项革新可说是关键的关键，因为卷出来的电木管需要把两端弄齐，要是只靠手工操作，怎样也不能完成任务。王凤恩针对这个问题，深思苦想，经过七、八次的试验再试验，终于研究出一种切管自动装置。他把切管自动装置安在卷管机上，随着卷管机的转动，电木管的两端也随着切齐了，结果切管的工序一个工人也不需要了。
    王凤恩在研究切管自动装置的同时，还帮助技术革新大队的其他人员实现了接套机、双管卷筑机等五个技术革新项目，每项革新都比原来提高生产效率一倍以上。
    王凤恩是在党的培养下成长起来的一个工人出身的工程师。八年来，他一共实现了二百三十多项技术革新，使他所在的绝缘车间由全部手工操作变为70％以上机械化生产。现在，他正在领导技术革新大队继续研究，争取在国庆节之前实现电工工序的生产机械化。
