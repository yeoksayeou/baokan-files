Continue to Advance Under the Brilliant Banner of Mao Zedong!
Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League The great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived. The mountains are dancing, the seas are singing, and 650 million people are cheering the victory of the Great Leap Forward, the victory of the People's Communes, and the great victory of the Party's general line for building socialism. Facing the great festival of the motherland, the excitement, joy, and emotion of us intellectuals cannot be described in words; our experiences, understandings, and feelings over the past decade cannot be fully written down either.

With the Leadership of the Communist Party, Intellectuals Have a Bright and Happy Future

Now, let's just talk about the heartfelt thoughts of us intellectuals. We sincerely thank the Party and sincerely thank Chairman Mao. Because of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our most beloved motherland has been reborn and has a bright and splendid future. Because of the leadership and education of the Party and Chairman Mao, we intellectuals have escaped from the mire of the old society and have a bright and happy future.

First of all, let us recall the dim days of the past.

In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, cultural and educational undertakings were monopolized by the three major enemies. The broad masses of working people were deprived of the right to education, and illiteracy accounted for more than 70% of the population. The lives and work of us intellectuals had no guarantee whatsoever, and there was no political freedom. A few gentry, landlords, big bourgeoisie, bureaucrats, and compradors riding on the backs of the people acted as overlords, living a life of extravagance and debauchery, while the general cultural, educational, scientific, and technological workers were often trapped in a state of semi-hunger and semi-unemployment. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, weren't many talented intellectuals impoverished and struggling against hunger and persecution? Didn't many university professors participate in the struggle against hunger and persecution? The few young people who received school education also suffered the pain of "unemployment upon graduation." All patriotic and righteous intellectuals could not hold their heads high. Progressive professors and experts and scholars often suffered arrest and persecution, and there was even less talk of freedom of speech and academic freedom. Everyone still remembers how materially difficult and spiritually depressed our lives as intellectuals were in those dark days before liberation.

In 1949, the Communist Party of China led the people of the whole country to overthrow the three mountains that weighed on our heads and established our own people's regime. The Chinese people stood up, shaking the whole world. Chinese intellectuals saw the light of day again. At that time, some intellectuals, especially young intellectuals, were educated and influenced by the Party, some had already joined the revolutionary ranks, and some began to join the revolutionary ranks. They were revolutionary intellectuals. There were also a few people who resolutely opposed the revolution, some fled to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States; some hid among the people's ranks, holding hostile attitudes towards the new society and new things. These counter-revolutionaries were the scum of the intellectual circles. Apart from this, the majority of Chinese intellectuals, including the majority of members of the China Democratic League, witnessed the great motherland breaking free from the shackles of a century of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, gaining true independence and liberation, the unprecedented unity of the people of the whole country, and the great improvement of China's international status, and felt infinite joy and encouragement. This was one aspect. On the other hand, many people still adopted a wait-and-see and skeptical attitude towards the new society, new things, and new systems to varying degrees. This was very natural. We intellectuals who came from the old society were deeply influenced by feudalism and capitalism, still had illusions about old democracy and the so-called middle road, and could not adapt to the new society until we had accepted the leadership of the Party.

The Party and Chairman Mao's concern for intellectuals was meticulous. Only the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao most profoundly understood Chinese intellectuals, understood our advantages, and also understood our shortcomings. Over the past decade, the Party has adopted a policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. The first priority was to unite all forces that could be united. The Party provided those engaged in cultural, educational, scientific, and technological work with living care, work arrangements, and political status. The Party called on intellectuals to study Marxism-Leninism, study revolutionary history, study advanced Soviet experience, and especially called on intellectuals to participate in the revolutionary mass movement and physical labor, and to carry out self-education in revolutionary and labor practice. The purpose of unity and education was for transformation, to transform the bourgeois stand, viewpoints, and methods of thinking. The Party and Chairman Mao, using the theory of Marxism-Leninism combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution, always believed that bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals could be peacefully transformed. For ten years, the Party has extended warm hands to bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals more than thousands of times, asking them to abandon the bourgeois stand, viewpoints, and methods, resolutely carry out self-transformation, so as to contribute knowledge and strength together with workers and peasants for the construction of a new socialist China.

The Party's policy toward intellectuals has achieved extremely great victories - the political stand and ideological understanding of Chinese intellectuals have generally undergone great changes

Over the past decade, the Party's policy toward intellectuals has achieved extremely great victories. Ten years, only ten years, the cause of our country in all aspects has undergone earth-shaking changes, and the situation in the intellectual circles has also undergone earth-shaking changes.

First of all, cultural and educational undertakings and scientific research work have developed vigorously. Over the past decade, the number of students in institutions of higher learning has increased more than five times, and the number of students in middle schools and primary schools has increased 4.7 times and 2.6 times respectively, and the number of children in kindergartens has increased 230 times. In the Great Leap Forward last year, a new high tide of literacy emerged with "everyone learning and ten thousand teaching," and the proportion of illiteracy has been greatly reduced. Many cities and counties across the country have basically universalized primary school education, and many areas that did not have a single institution of higher learning in the past now have many universities and colleges established. Science, technology, literature, and art have all achieved unprecedented development. The state's expenditure on cultural and educational construction has exceeded ten times that of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. In the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the lives and work of intellectuals have been fully guaranteed, and all experts and scholars have an infinitely broad venue to display their talents. This is unprecedented in Chinese history. After liberation, the people became masters of their own affairs, and revolutionary intellectuals, together with workers and peasants, became the masters of the country. The Party put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and launched a lively and free discussion on literary and academic matters, which not only promoted the national culture with a long history, but also created a socialist modern culture. In a short period of time, our country completed an unprecedented educational revolution, and implemented the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. The motherland is unprecedentedly strong, cultural and educational undertakings are developing vigorously, and the culturally backward old China has leaped to become an advanced new China, which makes all patriotic intellectuals feel proud. This was unimaginable before liberation, and it would not have been possible without the correct leadership of the Party and the wise guidance of Chairman Mao.

Over the past decade, the most tremendous change that has taken place in Chinese intellectuals under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao is still in the spiritual life, in the political stand and ideological understanding. Chairman Mao often taught us that people can be transformed, and all intellectuals must undergo ideological transformation in order to actively serve the new society. From our personal experience over the past decade, we have deeply realized the importance of ideological transformation. The Party and Chairman Mao correctly used the theory of Marxism-Leninism in combination with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution, which opened the eyes of us intellectuals who grew up in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old society. Through the revolutionary mass movements of land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the three-anti and five-anti campaigns, and ideological transformation, the Party educated intellectuals, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, stood firm on the people's stand, gradually established the labor viewpoint and the mass viewpoint, and gradually understood the laws of social development. Through the socialist transformation of the three major industries, the anti-rightist struggle, and the nationwide rectification movement, the Party conducted profound socialist education for intellectuals, helping intellectuals to break the bourgeois stand and establish the proletarian stand. Through the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the people's commune movement, intellectuals began to realize the importance of putting politics in command, the mass line, and the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants. Over the past decade, through the Party's education and work and labor practice, many intellectuals have transformed into working-class intellectuals, some have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China; some have begun to accept socialist transformation and are willing to accept the Party's leadership and take the socialist road; and some people, due to the general trend, after recognizing the two roads, the bourgeois stand is also beginning to waver.

In general, over the past decade, the spiritual outlook of the majority of intellectuals has undergone significant changes. The Party and Chairman Mao have pointed out a bright road and a correct direction for us intellectuals. However, whether to stride forward along this road and in this direction, or to hesitate and not move forward, still varies from person to person, and still depends on our own choices. In the ranks of intellectuals, there are still some people who adhere to the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist stand. They are bourgeois rightists. In the spring of 1957, due to their rampant attacks, a dark cloud floated in the Chinese sky. Although the nationwide anti-rightist struggle has achieved a huge victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, bad things have finally turned into good things, but from the perspective of us intellectuals, this is still a painful and profoundly meaningful lesson.

Chairman Mao taught us that all opposites can be transformed into each other, negative factors can be transformed into positive factors, contradictions between the enemy and ourselves can be transformed into internal contradictions, and even bourgeois rightists, as long as they change their evils and do good, repent and rehabilitate themselves, still have a future, and the door of socialism is open to everyone. How much appeal and encouragement the great spirit of the Party and Chairman Mao in curing diseases and saving people and being kind to people has on us intellectuals!

The transformation of intellectuals is a long-term, repeated, and fluctuating process. Only by wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party, with politics as the soul and politics in command, can intellectuals have a bright future.

Over the past decade, under the leadership of the Party and under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the political stand and ideological understanding of Chinese intellectuals have generally undergone great changes, which should be affirmed. But we have no reason to be complacent about it. The experience of the past decade has also proved that the ideological transformation of intellectuals is a long-term, repeated, and fluctuating process. Only through continuous and arduous efforts can we transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals. Chairman Mao taught us: "In order to fully adapt to the needs of the new society, and in order to unite with workers and peasants, intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, gradually abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian, communist world outlook. The transformation of the world outlook is a fundamental transformation, and the majority of intellectuals cannot be said to have completed this transformation now. We hope that the intellectuals of our country will continue to move forward, gradually establish a communist world outlook in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism well, and gradually integrate with workers and peasants, and do not stop halfway, let alone retreat backwards, and there is no way out for retreat." (Note 1)

Chairman Mao's instructions are completely correct. We must neither stop halfway nor retreat backwards, only progress is the way out. Where is the road to progress? Over the past decade, we have had many experiences and understandings. The experiences and understandings of a thousand or ten thousand lines can be summarized as: First, only by wholeheartedly accepting the leadership of the Party, with politics as the soul and politics in command, can intellectuals have a bright future. It is impossible not to lose direction if one deviates from the leadership of the Party, deviates from the politics of the proletariat. Second, intellectuals can only give full play to their talents by combining with workers and peasants, serving workers and peasants, and treating the revolutionary mass movement with a positive attitude. As Chairman Mao said, "Intellectuals will accomplish nothing if they do not combine with the workers, peasants, and masses" (Note 2). Third, service and transformation cannot be separated. Only by constantly strengthening transformation and improving awareness and ideological understanding can we better serve socialism. Only by exerting all our energy and striving for the top, and contributing all our knowledge and strength to socialist construction, can we gradually transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

On the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China today, the situation is encouraging. The Soviet Union's cosmic rocket has reached the surface of the moon, opening a new era for mankind to conquer outer space. In the whole world, the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the forces of peace prevail over the forces of war. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union shows unparalleled strength and unity. The decadent capitalist world is rotting day by day. Under the brilliant light of the general line, our great motherland, like the sun in the morning, is emitting a radiant glow in the East. The 650 million people are exerting infinite wisdom and soaring energy, and in the shortest possible time, they want to change the poor and blank face of our country, leap forward again and again, catch up with Britain and the United States, and make our country a prosperous and strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

On the great tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China today, we are willing to guarantee to the Party and to the people of the whole country that we must continue to transform ourselves, oppose right-leaning and encourage vigor, and together with the people of the whole country, contribute all our strength to the implementation of the Party's general line and to the magnificent cause of building socialism and communism in our country. We feel extremely proud to be born in the era of Mao Zedong. We must continue to advance under the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong.

    在光辉的毛泽东旗帜下不断前进！
    中国民主同盟主席　沈钧儒 新中国成立十周年的伟大节日到来了。山在舞蹈，海在歌唱，六亿五千万人民在齐声欢呼大跃进的胜利，欢呼人民公社的胜利，欢呼党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利。我们知识分子面临祖国的伟大节日，兴奋、喜悦和激动的心情，不是言语所能形容的；十年以来，我们的经历、体会、感想，也不是文字所能够写得完的。
    有了共产党的领导，知识分子才有光明幸福的前途
    现在，只说一说我们知识分子的心里话吧。我们衷心感谢党，衷心感谢毛主席。由于党和毛主席的领导，我们的最可爱的祖国，才得到新生，才有了光辉灿烂的前景。由于党和毛主席的领导和教育，我们知识分子才从旧社会的污泥中脱身，并且有了光明的幸福的前途。
    首先，让我们回顾一下过去的暗淡的日子吧。
    在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，文化教育事业是被三大敌人所垄断的。广大劳动人民被剥夺了享受教育的权利，文盲占人口的70％以上。我们知识分子的生活和工作，没有丝毫的保障，政治没有自由。少数骑在人民头上的豪绅、地主、大资产阶级、官僚、买办作威作福，过着骄奢淫逸的生活，而一般文教科技工作者，则经常陷于半饥饿半失业状态。在国民党反动统治时期，不是有很多有才华的知识分子穷途落魄，很多大学教授参加反饥饿反迫害的斗争吗？为数不多的受学校教育的青年，也遭到“毕业即失业”的痛苦。一切爱国的有正义感的知识分子是抬不起头来的。进步的教授和专家学者，时常遭受逮捕和迫害，更谈不到言论和学术的自由。大家总还记得，在解放以前那些黑暗的日子里，我们知识分子的物质生活是多么困苦，精神生活是多么苦闷啊。
    1949年，中国共产党领导全国人民，推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山，建立了人民自己的政权。中国人民站起来了，震动了全世界。中国知识分子重见了天日。其时，一部分知识分子，特别是青年知识分子，受了党的教育和影响，有的已经站到革命队伍中了，有的开始投入革命的行列，他们是革命的知识分子。另有少数人，是坚决反对革命的，有的逃到台湾、香港、美国；有的隐藏在人民队伍中间，对新社会、新事物抱敌对态度，这些反革命分子是知识界的败类。除此以外，中国知识分子的大多数，包含中国民主同盟的多数盟员在内，目睹伟大祖国摆脱了百年来的半殖民地半封建的枷锁，获得了真正的独立解放，全国人民空前地团结统一，中国国际地位大大提高，感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。这是一方面。另一方面，很多人对新社会、新事物、新制度，或多或少还采取观望和怀疑态度。这是很自然的。我们这些旧社会出身的知识分子，受封建主义资本主义的深厚影响，对旧民主主义和所谓中间道路还存有幻想，在还没有接受党的领导的时候，总是不能和新社会相适应的。
    党和毛主席对知识分子的关怀是无微不至的。只有中国共产党和毛主席最深刻了解中国知识分子，了解我们的优点，也了解我们的缺点。十年以来，党对知识分子采取团结、教育、改造的政策。首先是团结一切可以团结的力量。党对于从事文教科技工作的人员，给以生活照顾、工作安排和政治地位。党号召知识分子学习马克思列宁主义，学习革命历史，学习苏联先进经验，特别是号召知识分子参加革命的群众运动和体力劳动，在革命和劳动实践中进行自我教育。团结和教育的目的是为了改造，改造资产阶级的立场、观点和思想方法。党和毛主席运用马克思列宁主义的理论和中国革命实践相结合，始终认定资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子是可以和平改造的。十年来，党不止千百次地向资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子伸出热情的手，要求他们抛弃资产阶级的立场、观点和方法，坚决进行自我改造，以便和工人农民一道，为建设社会主义新中国，贡献出知识和力量。
    党对知识分子的政策取得了极其巨大的胜利——中国知识分子的政治立场和思想认识一般都有了很大的转变
    十年以来，党对知识分子的政策取得了极其巨大的胜利。十年，仅仅十年，我们国家各方面的事业起了翻天复地的变化，知识界的情况也起了翻天复地的变化。
    首先，文教事业和科学研究工作有了蓬勃的发展。十年以来，高等学校学生人数增长了五倍多，中学校和小学校学生人数，分别增长四点七倍和二点六倍，幼儿园儿童人数增长了二百三十倍。去年大跃进中出现了“全民学、万人教”的扫盲新高潮，文盲比例已经大大地降低。全国许多市、县已基本上普及了小学教育，许多过去没有一所高等学校的地区，现在许多大专学校建立起来了。科学、技术、文学、艺术都有了空前的发展。国家支出的文教建设经费，比国民党反动统治时期超过十倍以上。在社会主义建设大跃进中，知识分子的生活和工作，得到充分的保障，一切专家学者都有发挥自己才智的无限广阔的场地。这是中国历史上空前未有的。解放以后，人民当家作主了，革命知识分子和工人农民一道，成了国家的主人。党提出了百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，在文艺学术上展开了生动活泼的自由讨论，既发扬了有悠久历史的民族文化，又创造了社会主义的现代文化。在短短时间内，我国完成了史无前例的教育革命，贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。祖国空前强盛，文教事业蓬勃发展，文化落后的旧中国一跃而成为先进的新中国，使一切爱国的知识分子都为之扬眉吐气。这是解放以前所不能梦想的，没有党的正确领导，毛主席的英明教导，这也是不可能实现的。
    十年以来，在党和毛主席的教育之下，中国知识分子所发生的最巨大的变化，还在于精神生活方面，在于政治立场和思想认识方面。毛主席经常教导我们，人是可以改造的，一切知识分子都要经过思想改造，才能积极地为新的社会服务。从十年以来的亲身经历，我们深切体会到思想改造的重要性。党和毛主席正确地运用马克思列宁主义的理论与中国革命实践相结合，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利，使我们从半封建半殖民地的旧社会生长的知识分子睁开了眼睛。通过土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、三反五反、思想改造这些革命的群众运动，党教育了知识分子，分清敌我，站稳人民立场，逐步树立劳动观点和群众观点，逐步认识社会发展规律。通过社会主义三大改造，反右派斗争和全民整风运动，党向知识分子进行了深刻的社会主义教育，帮助知识分子破资产阶级立场，立无产阶级立场。通过党的社会主义建设总路线、工农业生产的大跃进和人民公社化运动，知识分子开始认识了政治挂帅、群众路线和知识分子与工农相结合的重要性。十年以来，通过党的教育与工作和劳动实践，不少知识分子转变成为工人阶级知识分子，有些人光荣地参加了中国共产党；有些人开始接受社会主义改造，愿意接受党的领导走社会主义道路；还有一些人，由于大势所趋，认清了两条道路之后，资产阶级的立场也正在开始动摇。
    总起来说，十年以来，大多数知识分子的精神面貌已经起了显著的变化。党和毛主席向我们知识分子指出了光明的道路和正确的方向。但是，按照这条道路和这个方向迈步前进呢，还是踌躇不前呢，这仍然因人而异，仍然决定于我们自己的选择。在知识分子队伍中，还有那么一些人，坚持反共、反人民、反社会主义的立场，他们是资产阶级右派分子。1957年春季，由于他们的猖狂进攻，中国天空浮起一片乌云。虽然全国人民反右派的斗争，使社会主义革命在政治思想战线上取得了巨大的胜利，坏事终于变为好事，但是，从我们知识分子来说，这仍然是一次惨痛的有深刻意义的教训。
    毛主席教导我们，一切对立面是可以互相转化的，消极因素可以转化为积极因素，敌我矛盾可以转化为内部矛盾，甚至资产阶级右派分子只要改恶从善，悔过自新，仍然是有前途的，社会主义的大门是对一切人开着的。党和毛主席这种治病救人、与人为善的伟大精神，对我们知识分子起着多么大的感召和鼓舞作用啊！
    知识分子的改造是长期的、反复的、时起时伏的。只有全心全意接受党的领导，以政治为灵魂，以政治为统帅，知识分子才有光明的前途
    十年以来，在党的领导之下，在毛主席的教导之下，中国知识分子的政治立场和思想认识，一般都有了很大的转变，这是应当肯定的。但是我们决没有理由因此自满。十年来的经历也证明着，知识分子的思想改造，是长期的、反复的、时起时伏的。必须经过不断的艰巨的努力，才能把我们自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。毛主席教导我们说：“为了充分适应新社会的需要，为了同工人农民团结一致，知识分子必须继续改造自己，逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。”（注一）
    毛主席的指示是完全正确的。我们既不能中途停顿，更不能向后倒退，只有前进才是出路。前进的道路在那里呢？十年以来，我们的经验和体会是很多的。一千条一万条的经验和体会，总起来是：第一，只有全心全意接受党的领导，以政治为灵魂，以政治为统帅，知识分子才有光明的前途。脱离了党的领导，脱离了无产阶级的政治，不迷失方向是不可能的。第二，知识分子只有与工人农民相结合，为工人农民服务，以积极的态度对待革命的群众运动，才能充分发挥自己的才能。正如毛主席所说的，“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”（注二）。第三，服务与改造是不能分离的。只有不断加强改造，提高觉悟和思想认识，才能更好的为社会主义服务。也只有鼓足干劲、力争上游，对社会主义建设贡献出全部的知识和力量，才能逐步改造自己成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    在伟大的建国十周年的今天，形势是使人鼓舞的。苏联的宇宙火箭到达了月球面上，开辟了人类征服宇宙空间的新纪元。在整个世界，东风压倒了西风，和平的力量战胜了战争的力量。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，显出无比的强大和团结一致。腐朽的资本主义世界，正在一天天烂下去。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们的伟大祖国，正如早晨的太阳，在东方放出万丈光芒。六亿五千万人民，正在发挥出无穷的智慧和冲天的干劲，要在最短的时期内，改变我国一穷二白的面貌，跃进再跃进，超英赶美，使我国成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的繁荣富强的社会主义国家。
    在伟大的建国十周年的今天，我们愿意向党、向全国人民保证，我们一定要继续不断地改造自己，反右倾、鼓干劲，和全国人民一道，为贯彻执行党的总路线，为在我国建设社会主义、共产主义的宏伟事业，贡献出我们的一切力量。我们为生在毛泽东时代而感到无比的骄傲。我们一定要在光辉的毛泽东旗帜下不断前进。
