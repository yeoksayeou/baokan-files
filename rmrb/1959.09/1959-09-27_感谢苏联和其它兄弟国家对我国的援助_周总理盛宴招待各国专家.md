Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet tonight to entertain experts and their wives from the Soviet Union, other brotherly countries, and brotherly parties who are helping our country with its construction, and warmly expressed his heartfelt respect and cordial greetings to all the experts.

Before the festival arrives, the festive atmosphere has already descended. Experts and their accompanying hosts gathered together, and the magnificent banquet hall was brightly lit, filled with a warm atmosphere and the joy of friendship.

Premier Zhou Enlai said excitedly at the banquet that the past ten years have been ten years of new and great victories for Marxism-Leninism in China. The days when the old China was in a colonial and semi-colonial state, suffering humiliation and being subjected to slaughter, are gone forever. Today, the new socialist China stands like a giant in the East. The balance of power between capitalism and socialism in the world has changed in a new way that is favorable to world peace and the cause of human progress due to the consolidation and development of the new China.

Premier Zhou's words were met with a storm of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

Tonight, Vice Premiers of the State Council Lin Biao, He Long, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Tan Zhenlin, Lu Dingyi, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Marshals of the People's Republic of China Liu Bocheng, Luo Ronghuan, Xu Xiangqian, Ye Jianying, and the heads of various offices, ministries, and commissions of the State Council attended the banquet as escorts.

The grand banquet began at 8:10 PM. Premier Zhou Enlai spoke amidst warm applause from the audience. He said that the past ten years have been ten years in which the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The victory of the Chinese people over the past ten years is the result of the Chinese Communist Party combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and the result of the Chinese Communist Party, with the working class as its leader and the worker-peasant alliance as its foundation, forming a broad people's democratic united front, fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, and making the revolution develop from one stage to another without interruption. The general line of the democratic revolution, the general line of the socialist revolution, and the general line of socialist construction of the Chinese Communist Party all clearly illustrate that our party's consistent ideological principle is to be loyal to the theories and principles of Marxism-Leninism and to flexibly apply and develop them according to China's specific conditions, and that our party resolutely relies on the mass movement under the leadership of the party and adheres to the working method of the mass line, whether in revolution or in construction. Our party is both a Marxist-Leninist revolutionist of developmental stages and a Marxist-Leninist of continuous revolution. It is precisely because of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong that China's revolution and construction have always developed along the correct path over the past ten years, moving from victory to victory.

Premier Zhou said that the Chinese revolution is the continuation of the great October Revolution. We have always believed that our cause is part of the entire socialist camp and the socialist cause of the whole world. Over the past ten years, the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries have provided tremendous and fraternal assistance to China's socialist construction, and outstanding experts from various brotherly countries and brotherly parties have also made tireless efforts. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the governments and people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and to all the hardworking experts. In order to rapidly build socialism in our country, we must continue to learn from the advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries.

Premier Zhou emphasized that the current domestic and international situation is very favorable for the rapid development of our country's socialist construction. He said that domestically, various departments of the national economy continue to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes have not only firmly established themselves, but have also demonstrated great superiority in overcoming this year's extraordinary natural disasters and ensuring continued agricultural production. In the past month or so, the broad masses of people across the country have responded even more enthusiastically to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and are carrying out a resolute struggle against right-leaning opportunism, holding high the shining banner of the general line, and launching a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. Judging from the current situation, it is entirely certain that the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled within this year. Internationally, the general situation of socialist forces prevailing over imperialist forces, national independence movements prevailing over colonialism, and peace forces prevailing over war forces has further developed. The successful launch of the second cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union to the moon, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and the new proposal for complete disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union have greatly encouraged all peace-loving countries and peoples to fight for easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. The imperialist camp headed by the United States still adheres to its policies of aggression and war and refuses to abandon the "Cold War," but this will only cause them more difficulties and put them in greater isolation, and the general trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind in the international arena cannot be reversed by any force.

Premier Zhou concluded by saying that the Chinese people are joyfully looking back on the great achievements of the past ten years, while also looking forward to a bright and splendid future with full confidence.

Premier Zhou's speech repeatedly aroused enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

The envoys of the Soviet Union and various brotherly countries to China were invited to attend the banquet. Antonov, Charg√© d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, spoke at the banquet. He said that over the past ten years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their vanguard, the glorious Communist Party of China, have achieved brilliant victories in socialist construction. The Chinese people are struggling to build their motherland into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and news of their new achievements in this struggle comes every day.

He said that deep fraternal friendship closely links the Soviet and Chinese peoples together. Today, we are especially happy to see that our two friendly countries and other countries in the socialist camp are taking consistent action on all major international issues and playing a decisive role in all aspects of international life. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and his proposal for universal and complete disarmament by all countries at the United Nations General Assembly particularly clearly confirm this.

He said that Soviet-Chinese friendship is unbreakable, it is a powerful force, and it is a bulwark of peace and human security. The imperialist bloc is doing everything possible to shake our friendship, but all their attempts are doomed to failure. The unity of our two great powers is a powerful fortress to crush any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism.

Antonov's speech was warmly applauded by the entire audience.

Hungarian Ambassador to China, Nogradi, delivered a speech in which he, on behalf of the envoys of various brotherly countries to China and the experts of various brotherly countries in China, warmly congratulated the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and wished the Chinese people greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction in the future.

Soviet expert leader Fumin then spoke at the meeting. He said that the tremendous achievements made by the People's Republic of China powerfully prove the correctness and wisdom of the general line of the Communist Party of China in building socialism. It is precisely because the policy of the Chinese Communist Party has won the support of the people of the whole country and embodies the wishes and requirements of the Chinese people that there was the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued Leap Forward this year. Only those who are blind and have completely lost their rationality cannot see the victorious and powerful pace of the Chinese people, and cannot see the Chinese people advancing towards a bright future, towards socialism, by leaps and bounds. He said that the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China have given a very high evaluation of the assistance that the Soviet Union has given to China's economic development in the past and present, which makes us feel proud. All of us Soviet experts will spare no effort to work more effectively, impart the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people, in order to promote the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the great peoples of our two countries.

The atmosphere of unity and friendship at the grand banquet became increasingly warm. Vice Premiers Lin Biao, Chen Yi, and Li Fuchun successively stood up and raised their glasses to toast. Vice Premier Lin Biao proposed a toast to the powerful people's armed forces of the socialist camp countries, to the forces of peace and progress that will surely defeat the forces of war and aggression, to the defense of the peaceful labor and happy life of the people of the world, and to the great unity of proletarian internationalism. Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to the unity and cooperation of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, to the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, to the victory that socialism has already achieved in China, to the victory that socialism will surely achieve worldwide, and to the health of the leaders of the parties and governments of the socialist countries. Vice Premier Li Fuchun proposed a toast to the increasing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in implementing the Seven-Year Plan for communist construction, to the successful arrival of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket to the moon, to the great achievements made by other brotherly countries in the cause of socialist construction, to thanking the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and brotherly parties for their assistance to our country's construction, and to the health and happiness of all the experts and their wives and children. At this time, a burst of applause and joyful laughter rang out in the hall. (Attached picture)
