Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet tonight to entertain experts and their wives from the Soviet Union, other brotherly countries, and brotherly parties who are helping our country with its construction, and warmly expressed his heartfelt respect and cordial greetings to all the experts.

Before the festival arrives, the festive atmosphere has already descended. Experts and their accompanying hosts gathered together, and the magnificent banquet hall was brightly lit, filled with a warm atmosphere and the joy of friendship.

Premier Zhou Enlai said excitedly at the banquet that the past ten years have been ten years of new and great victories for Marxism-Leninism in China. The days when the old China was in a colonial and semi-colonial state, suffering humiliation and being subjected to slaughter, are gone forever. Today, the new socialist China stands like a giant in the East. The balance of power between capitalism and socialism in the world has changed in a new way that is favorable to world peace and the cause of human progress due to the consolidation and development of the new China.

Premier Zhou's words were met with a storm of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

Tonight, Vice Premiers of the State Council Lin Biao, He Long, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Tan Zhenlin, Lu Dingyi, Luo Ruiqing, Xi Zhongxun, Marshals of the People's Republic of China Liu Bocheng, Luo Ronghuan, Xu Xiangqian, Ye Jianying, and the heads of various offices, ministries, and commissions of the State Council attended the banquet as escorts.

The grand banquet began at 8:10 PM. Premier Zhou Enlai spoke amidst warm applause from the audience. He said that the past ten years have been ten years in which the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The victory of the Chinese people over the past ten years is the result of the Chinese Communist Party combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and the result of the Chinese Communist Party, with the working class as its leader and the worker-peasant alliance as its foundation, forming a broad people's democratic united front, fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, and making the revolution develop from one stage to another without interruption. The general line of the democratic revolution, the general line of the socialist revolution, and the general line of socialist construction of the Chinese Communist Party all clearly illustrate that our party's consistent ideological principle is to be loyal to the theories and principles of Marxism-Leninism and to flexibly apply and develop them according to China's specific conditions, and that our party resolutely relies on the mass movement under the leadership of the party and adheres to the working method of the mass line, whether in revolution or in construction. Our party is both a Marxist-Leninist revolutionist of developmental stages and a Marxist-Leninist of continuous revolution. It is precisely because of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong that China's revolution and construction have always developed along the correct path over the past ten years, moving from victory to victory.

Premier Zhou said that the Chinese revolution is the continuation of the great October Revolution. We have always believed that our cause is part of the entire socialist camp and the socialist cause of the whole world. Over the past ten years, the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries have provided tremendous and fraternal assistance to China's socialist construction, and outstanding experts from various brotherly countries and brotherly parties have also made tireless efforts. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the governments and people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and to all the hardworking experts. In order to rapidly build socialism in our country, we must continue to learn from the advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries.

Premier Zhou emphasized that the current domestic and international situation is very favorable for the rapid development of our country's socialist construction. He said that domestically, various departments of the national economy continue to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes have not only firmly established themselves, but have also demonstrated great superiority in overcoming this year's extraordinary natural disasters and ensuring continued agricultural production. In the past month or so, the broad masses of people across the country have responded even more enthusiastically to the call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and are carrying out a resolute struggle against right-leaning opportunism, holding high the shining banner of the general line, and launching a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. Judging from the current situation, it is entirely certain that the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled within this year. Internationally, the general situation of socialist forces prevailing over imperialist forces, national independence movements prevailing over colonialism, and peace forces prevailing over war forces has further developed. The successful launch of the second cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union to the moon, Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States, and the new proposal for complete disarmament put forward by the Soviet Union have greatly encouraged all peace-loving countries and peoples to fight for easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. The imperialist camp headed by the United States still adheres to its policies of aggression and war and refuses to abandon the "Cold War," but this will only cause them more difficulties and put them in greater isolation, and the general trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind in the international arena cannot be reversed by any force.

Premier Zhou concluded by saying that the Chinese people are joyfully looking back on the great achievements of the past ten years, while also looking forward to a bright and splendid future with full confidence.

Premier Zhou's speech repeatedly aroused enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

The envoys of the Soviet Union and various brotherly countries to China were invited to attend the banquet. Antonov, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, spoke at the banquet. He said that over the past ten years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their vanguard, the glorious Communist Party of China, have achieved brilliant victories in socialist construction. The Chinese people are struggling to build their motherland into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and news of their new achievements in this struggle comes every day.

He said that deep fraternal friendship closely links the Soviet and Chinese peoples together. Today, we are especially happy to see that our two friendly countries and other countries in the socialist camp are taking consistent action on all major international issues and playing a decisive role in all aspects of international life. Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States and his proposal for universal and complete disarmament by all countries at the United Nations General Assembly particularly clearly confirm this.

He said that Soviet-Chinese friendship is unbreakable, it is a powerful force, and it is a bulwark of peace and human security. The imperialist bloc is doing everything possible to shake our friendship, but all their attempts are doomed to failure. The unity of our two great powers is a powerful fortress to crush any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism.

Antonov's speech was warmly applauded by the entire audience.

Hungarian Ambassador to China, Nogradi, delivered a speech in which he, on behalf of the envoys of various brotherly countries to China and the experts of various brotherly countries in China, warmly congratulated the great festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and wished the Chinese people greater achievements in the cause of socialist construction in the future.

Soviet expert leader Fumin then spoke at the meeting. He said that the tremendous achievements made by the People's Republic of China powerfully prove the correctness and wisdom of the general line of the Communist Party of China in building socialism. It is precisely because the policy of the Chinese Communist Party has won the support of the people of the whole country and embodies the wishes and requirements of the Chinese people that there was the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the continued Leap Forward this year. Only those who are blind and have completely lost their rationality cannot see the victorious and powerful pace of the Chinese people, and cannot see the Chinese people advancing towards a bright future, towards socialism, by leaps and bounds. He said that the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China have given a very high evaluation of the assistance that the Soviet Union has given to China's economic development in the past and present, which makes us feel proud. All of us Soviet experts will spare no effort to work more effectively, impart the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people, in order to promote the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the great peoples of our two countries.

The atmosphere of unity and friendship at the grand banquet became increasingly warm. Vice Premiers Lin Biao, Chen Yi, and Li Fuchun successively stood up and raised their glasses to toast. Vice Premier Lin Biao proposed a toast to the powerful people's armed forces of the socialist camp countries, to the forces of peace and progress that will surely defeat the forces of war and aggression, to the defense of the peaceful labor and happy life of the people of the world, and to the great unity of proletarian internationalism. Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to the unity and cooperation of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, to the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, to the victory that socialism has already achieved in China, to the victory that socialism will surely achieve worldwide, and to the health of the leaders of the parties and governments of the socialist countries. Vice Premier Li Fuchun proposed a toast to the increasing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in implementing the Seven-Year Plan for communist construction, to the successful arrival of the Soviet Union's second cosmic rocket to the moon, to the great achievements made by other brotherly countries in the cause of socialist construction, to thanking the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries and brotherly parties for their assistance to our country's construction, and to the health and happiness of all the experts and their wives and children. At this time, a burst of applause and joyful laughter rang out in the hall. (Attached picture)

    感谢苏联和其它兄弟国家对我国的援助
    周总理盛宴招待各国专家
    周总理说：过去的十年是马克思列宁主义在中国取得新的伟大胜利的十年，今天，社会主义的新中国像巨人一样屹立在东方，世界力量的对比起了新的有利于和平和人类进步事业的变化
    新华社26日讯　建国十周年的伟大节日即将到来，周恩来总理在今晚举行盛大宴会，招待帮助我国进行建设的苏联、各兄弟国家和各兄弟党的专家及夫人，向全体专家们，热烈地表示衷心的敬意和亲切的问候。
    节日未到，节日的气氛已经降临。专家们和陪同的主人济济一堂，宏伟瑰丽的宴会大厅里华灯辉煌，充满了热烈的气氛和友谊的欢乐。
    周恩来总理在宴会上兴奋地说，过去的十年，是马克思列宁主义在中国取得新的伟大胜利的十年。旧中国处在殖民地和半殖民地的地位，受尽屈辱、横遭宰割的日子永远地一去不复返了。今天，社会主义的新中国，像巨人一样屹立在世界的东方。资本主义和社会主义在全世界的力量对比，由于新中国的巩固和发展，起了新的有利于世界和平和人类进步事业的变化。
    周总理的这些话，受到了全场暴风雨般的热烈掌声。
    今晚，国务院副总理林彪、贺龙、陈毅、乌兰夫、李富春、李先念、聂荣臻、薄一波、谭震林、陆定一、罗瑞卿、习仲勋，中华人民共和国元帅刘伯承、罗荣桓、徐向前、叶剑英，以及国务院各办公室、各部委的负责人都出席宴会作陪。
    盛大的宴会在晚上八时十分开始。周恩来总理在满堂热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，过去的十年，是中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中取得光辉成就的十年。中国人民十年来的胜利，是中国共产党把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的结果，是中国共产党以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础，组成广泛的人民民主统一战线，充分地发动和依靠群众，使革命不停顿地从一个阶段发展到另一个阶段的结果。中国共产党的民主革命的总路线、社会主义革命的总路线、社会主义建设的总路线，都清楚地说明：我们党一贯的思想原则是忠于马克思列宁主义的理论和原则并且根据中国的具体情况灵活地加以运用和发展，我们党不论在革命或者在建设中都坚决依靠在党领导下的群众运动，坚持群众路线的工作方法。我们党既是马克思列宁主义的革命发展阶段论者，又是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者。正是由于中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导，十年来中国的革命和建设始终沿着正确的道路向前发展，从胜利走向胜利。
    周总理说，中国革命是伟大十月革命的继续。我们从来就认为，我们的事业是整个社会主义阵营和全世界的社会主义事业的一部分。十年来，伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家对于中国的社会主义建设提供了巨大的、兄弟般的援助，各兄弟国家和兄弟党派来的优秀的专家们也付出了辛勤的劳动。我代表中国政府和中国人民，向苏联和其他社会主义国家的政府和人民，向勤劳备至的全体专家们表示衷心的感谢。为了在我国迅速建成社会主义，我们必须继续学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验和科学技术。
    周总理强调地指出，目前国内外的形势对于我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展十分有利。他说，在国内方面，国民经济的各个部门在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进，人民公社不但巩固地站稳了脚跟，而且在战胜今年的特大自然灾害、保证农业继续增产方面，显示了巨大的优越性。最近一个多月来，全国广大人民更热烈地响应中国共产党八届八中全会的号召，同右倾机会主义进行坚决的斗争，更高地举起总路线的光辉旗帜，掀起一个新的增产节约运动的高潮。从目前的情况看来，在今年内完成和超额完成第二个五年计划的主要指标，是完全有把握的。在国际方面，社会主义力量胜过帝国主义力量、民族独立运动力量胜过殖民主义力量、和平力量胜过战争力量的总形势有了进一步的发展。苏联发射的第二个宇宙火箭成功地到达月球、赫鲁晓夫同志在美国的访问、苏联提出的全面裁军的新建议，都大大的鼓舞了一切爱好和平的国家和人民为和缓国际紧张局势、维护世界和平而斗争的信心。以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，仍然坚持它们的侵略政策和战争政策，不肯放弃“冷战”，但是，这只会使它们遭到更多的困难，陷于更大的孤立，而国际上东风日盛、西风日衰的总趋势，是任何力量也扭转不了的。
    周总理最后说，中国人民以欢乐的心情回顾十年来的伟大成就，同时满怀信心地瞻望着光明灿烂的未来。
    周总理的讲话，一再引起了全场的热烈鼓掌。
    苏联和各兄弟国家驻中国的使节都应邀出席了宴会。苏联驻中国大使馆临时代办安东诺夫在宴会上讲话。他说，十年来，中国人民在自己的先锋队光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的胜利。中国人民正在为把祖国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国而斗争，每天都传来他们在这个斗争中取得新的成就的消息。
    他说，深厚的兄弟般的友谊将苏联人民和中国人民紧密地连结在一起。今天我们特别高兴地看到，我们两个友好的国家和社会主义阵营其他国家对国际上的一切重大问题都采取一致的行动，对国际生活的各个方面在起着决定性的作用。赫鲁晓夫同志的访问美国和他在联合国大会上提出的各国普遍彻底裁军的建议，特别鲜明地证实了这一点。
    他说，苏中友谊是牢不可破的，它是强大的力量，它是和平和人类安全的堡垒。帝国主义集团正在千方百计地动摇我们的友谊，但是他们的一切企图都注定要失败的。我们两个伟大强国的团结一致是使帝国主义任何侵略阴谋遭到粉碎的强大堡垒。
    安东诺夫的讲话，获得了全场的热烈掌声。
    匈牙利驻中国大使诺格拉第致词，他代表各兄弟国家驻中国的使节和各兄弟国家在中国的专家，热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立十周年的伟大节日，祝中国人民今后在社会主义建设事业中取得更伟大的成就。
    苏联专家负责人符明接着在会上讲话。他说，中华人民共和国所取得的巨大成就，有力地证明了中国共产党的建设社会主义总路线的正确和英明。正因为中国共产党的政策得到了全国人民的拥护，体现了中国人民的愿望和要求，才有1958年的大跃进，才有今年的继续跃进。只有那些瞎了眼的、完全失去理性的人，才看不到中国人民这种胜利的、有力的步伐，看不到中国人民向着美好的将来，向着社会主义一日千里的前进。他说，中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府对苏联过去和现在对中国经济发展给予的援助，作了很高的评价，这使我们感到自豪。我们全体苏联专家将不惜一切力量更有成效地工作，把苏联的先进经验传授给中国人民，以促进我们两国伟大人民之间的友谊进一步发展和巩固。
    盛大宴会上的团结和友谊的气氛越来越热烈。林彪、陈毅、李富春副总理，相继起立举杯致词。林彪副总理提议，为社会主义阵营各国强大的人民武装力量，为和平进步力量必将战胜战争侵略势力，为保卫世界人民的和平劳动和幸福生活，为无产阶级国际主义的大团结，干杯。陈毅副总理提议，为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的团结和合作，为中国人民同苏联和各社会主义国家人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，为社会主义已经在中国取得的胜利，为社会主义必将在全世界范围内取得胜利，为社会主义各国党和政府的领袖们的健康，干杯。李富春副总理提议为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，为苏联在执行共产主义建设七年计划中所取得的伟大成就，为苏联第二个宇宙火箭成功地到达月球，为其他各兄弟国家在社会主义建设事业中所取得的伟大成就，为感谢苏联和其他各兄弟国家、各兄弟党对我国建设事业的帮助，为所有的专家们和他们的夫人们、孩子们的健康幸福，干杯。这时候，会场上响起一片掌声和欢乐的笑声。（附图片）
