　　The morning sun rises, and the ancient pottery capital greets the brilliant dawn with a sky full of rising blue smoke.

　　Today’s pottery capital has changed. Besides the long kilns on the hillside that look like crouching dragons, besides the boats that shuttle back and forth on the canal, besides the vats and jars piled up like small mountains, at the foot of Nanshan Mountain in Dingshu Town, along the wide, newly built road, there has appeared a modern chemical ceramics factory and many other new factories. Rows of sawtooth-shaped factory buildings, arched dome-shaped down-draft kilns, pairs of chimneys soaring into the sky... constitute another magnificent picture.

　　Here, people not only use handicrafts to imitate the famous Zisha (purple clay) crafts and daily-use pottery in history, but also use machines to produce advanced ceramic chemical equipment indispensable for socialist industrial construction. Some of these products are as large as power plant boilers, weighing 1,500 kilograms, and some are as delicate as sculpted flowers. However, after being fired, they can withstand high temperatures of thousands of degrees, high pressures of hundreds of kilograms, and the corrosion of strong acids. Many important pieces of equipment in modern chemical factories cannot do without them. In the warehouse square of the chemical ceramics factory, you can see complete sets of sulfuric acid towers, alcohol distillation towers, water pumps and blowers that can rotate thousands of times per minute, and ceramic paper machines including drying cylinders, pressure rollers, cylinder formers, digesters, slag removers and other complete components... Many products here used to be made of stainless steel and precious alloys, but now they are completely replaced by ceramics. Many varieties used to rely on imports, but now they can be completely manufactured domestically. Almost every day, people from many modern chemical factories across the country travel thousands of miles to place orders here. People may ask: Yixing Dingshu Town is originally a nationally famous place for producing pottery, so wouldn’t workers have been able to make ceramic chemical equipment before?

　　No, there was a thought-provoking story here.

　　Twenty-six years ago, Gu Haoyuan, a famous potter in Dingshu Town, had excellent skills. He was familiar with the soil quality in the surrounding mountains, just like he was familiar with the lines in his palm. As long as he pinched it with his hand, he would know which piece had good viscosity and which piece had high strength. He once tried to use various types of clay in combination to make the first acid-resistant ceramic distiller in Dingshu Town. At that time, it was the early stage of China's chemical industry, and many acid-resistant ceramic equipment had to rely on imports from abroad. In order to control the production of bleaching powder in Shanghai Tianyuan Chemical Factory, imperialist countries viciously blockaded the import of acid-resistant ceramic equipment. Gu Haoyuan's initiative should have been such an important contribution to the development of the chemical industry at that time! However, in a society ruled by exploiting classes, who would look up to this "mud brick" "stinky kiln worker"? The capitalists regarded acid-resistant ceramics as a rare commodity to make money, and when they saw an opportunity to make money, they asked Gu Haoyuan to make a kiln, and when they didn't need it, they said to him: "You are old, and the burden on your family is heavy, go find another way to make a living." Acid-resistant ceramics—the first spark of China's ceramic industry—was extinguished silently.

　　From the age of fourteen when he became an apprentice, to before liberation in 1949, Gu Haoyuan rolled in the mud for a full thirty-five years, experienced the vicissitudes of life, his wife and children fell down and died of starvation one after another, his house was burned down by a fire, and natural disasters, man-made disasters and the exploitation of capitalists dragged him into the abyss of poverty and suffering.

　　Miserable life, generation after generation, devastated people's wisdom and energy. Who still had the mind to create anything? In the pottery capital, the ancient dragon kilns on the mountainside have been emitting blue smoke for 2,400 years, and can only produce some simple jars and pots. The Zisha (purple clay) craftsmanship with a long historical tradition, although it had its heyday in the Ming and Qing dynasties and bloomed brightly, gradually withered in the era of Kuomintang rule, and was dying by the eve of liberation. At that time, a ballad was circulating in the pottery capital:

　　Green grass on the kiln is as dense as hemp,
　　Cotton grows on the mud ash pile,
　　Melon vines are wrapped around the trees at the kiln head,
　　Crows cry in the thickets of thorns.

　　The desolate situation can be imagined!

　　In 1949, the pottery capital was liberated. The new China was like a large colored pen descending from the sky, wiping out the tragic history of the pottery capital in one fell swoop. Ceramic workers who had been exploited for generations and lost their confidence in life raised their heads, workers who had been wandering in other places returned, the dragon kilns once again spewed clouds and fog, and the flower that had been extinguished—using acid-resistant ceramics to make chemical equipment—was ignited again.

　　Gu Haoyuan, with his son, started working again.

　　Heroic will finally overcame all difficulties. On October 1, 1950, when the salute celebrating the second National Day of the motherland echoed on the Tiananmen Gate Tower, the first acid-resistant ceramic blower manufactured in China was born in Shanghai Tianyuan Chemical Factory. The impeller of the blower sang a crisp and melodious song, singing the youth of the motherland and the youth of the ceramic industry.

　　With a good start, the road ahead is much broader. From 1951 to 1956, Gu Haoyuan and his son successively created more chemical ceramic equipment, one more complicated than the other, and one more precise than the other. Acid-resistant ceramic centrifugal separators, acid-resistant ceramic turbine pumps, acid-resistant ceramic liquid ring gas pumps, etc. Many products that originally relied on imports were manufactured one by one in their hands, and some have reached international standards.

　　Only five or six years! Under the leadership of the Party, the hardworking people have pushed China's ceramic industry to a new era.

　　With the development of China's chemical industry, a large amount of ceramic equipment is needed to replace steel and precious alloys. According to the principle of using local materials, the state decided to invest in Dingshu Town, which is rich in clay, to build a modern chemical ceramics factory. The ceramics department of Shanghai Tianyuan Chemical Factory also moved to the new factory in Dingshu Town. Gu Haoyuan and his son, who had grown up, returned to their hometown again. When the father and son generations left Dingshu Town, they were "stinky kiln workers" discriminated against by the old society. Now they are glorious Communist Party members and hold leadership positions as deputy directors in this modern chemical ceramics factory. From then on, they began a new journey of building a modern ceramic industry.

　　After only a short year of operation, the factory now has more than 1,200 workers. 70% of these workers are newcomers who just entered the factory a year ago. The workers who originally moved from Shanghai have now become the technical backbone of the workshop. They are trying their best to enable these novices to quickly master the technology. Although Gu Haoyuan and his son have become factory directors, people still see them in the workshop every day. Wherever there are difficulties, they personally go to solve them; wherever there are new achievements, they also enthusiastically participate in research. Gu Haoyuan is particularly concerned about the training of new workers. They all understand how much the ever-changing construction of the pottery capital needs young people to grow up quickly!

　　Nowadays, in addition to the chemical ceramics factory specializing in the production of chemical equipment, there are two ceramic factories in the entire Dingshu Town that have also begun to produce a part of chemical ceramics. The products of these three factories are not only used in the chemical industry, but also widely used in twenty-one industrial sectors such as petroleum, smelting, papermaking, pharmaceuticals, printing and dyeing, and food. In 1956, the total output of chemical equipment in the town was only more than 240 cubic meters, but by the first half of 1959, the output had increased to 130,000 cubic meters. The products supplied the needs of industrial construction in twenty-four provinces and cities across the country, but the demand still exceeded the supply. Old orders have not been delivered, and new orders have followed; old products are still being produced, and drawings of new products have been sent to the factory. Pottery capital! How much the motherland needs you!

　　Isn’t the history of the joys and sorrows of Gu Haoyuan’s father and son generations the history of the rise and fall of the chemical ceramic industry? Isn’t it a small microcosm of the changes of our times?

　　The birth of the chemical ceramics factory has become a milestone in the development of China's ceramic industry towards high-level precision and modernization. It has also become the heart of the entire pottery capital. It shines with the light of life like the morning glow, and its light illuminates every corner of the pottery capital and the hearts of every pottery capital worker. The older generation sticks to their posts; the new generation of young people are more courageous and bolder. In July last year, when the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government put forward the call to "replace steel with ceramics," the ceramic chemical factory once again took the lead and, with its advanced technology, drove the twelve ceramic factories in the town into a wave of technical revolution.

　　The morning sun rises. Look, everything in the pottery capital is illuminated by the brilliance of the morning glow, full of vitality. It has wiped away the dust and ashes of more than two thousand years and revealed a girl's blushing cheeks again.

　　Ancient and young pottery capital! In the great socialist construction, may you always be youthful and move forward in big strides. (With pictures)

    千里朝霞映陶都
    本报记者  张竞 惜晨
    朝阳升起来了，古老的陶都用漫天缭绕的青烟迎接着绚烂的早晨。
    今日的陶都已经变了样子。除了那山坡上一条条卧龙似的长窑，除了那运河上穿梭般的移动的船只，除了那堆叠得像小山一样的缸缸坛坛，在丁蜀镇的南山脚下，沿着宽阔的新筑的马路，又出现了一座近代化的化工陶瓷厂和其他许多新工厂。一排排锯齿形的厂房，一座座拱圆形的倒焰窑，一对对耸入高空的烟囱……构成了另一幅壮丽的图景。
    在这里，人们不仅用手工仿制着历史上有名的紫砂工艺品和日用陶器，而且也用机器生产出了社会主义工业建设所少不了的高级陶瓷化工设备。这些产品有的粗大得像发电厂的锅炉，重达一千五百公斤，有的精巧得像雕塑的花朵。可是，它们经过烧成以后，却能经得起一千几百度的高温，经得起几百公斤的高压，经得起强酸的腐蚀，近代化的化学工厂许多重要的设备都离不了它。在化工陶瓷厂的仓库广场上，你就可以看到那成套的硫酸塔、酒精蒸馏塔，看到那一分钟能转几千转的戽水泵、鼓风机，看到那包括烘缸、压辊、圆网架、蒸煮锅、除渣器等成套部件的陶瓷造纸机……这里有很多产品，过去要用不锈钢和贵重的合金来制造，现在完全用陶瓷来代替了，许多品种过去要依靠进口，现在已经完全能自己制造了。全国许多近代化的化工厂几乎每天都有人不远千里到这里来订货。人们也许要问：宜兴丁蜀镇本来就是全国闻名的产陶器的地方，难道，在这以前，工人们就不会造陶瓷的化工设备吗？
    不，这里曾有过一段发人深思的故事。
    二十六年前，丁蜀镇上有名的陶工顾浩元有着一手好手艺。他熟悉周围山里的土质，就好像熟悉他手掌心里的纹路一样，只要用手一捏，就知道那一块粘性好，那一块强度高。他曾经试着用各种不同性质的陶土配合起来，制成了丁蜀镇第一个耐酸的陶瓷蒸馏器。那时正是我国化学工业初创时期，许多耐酸的陶瓷设备都要依靠国外进口，帝国主义国家为了控制上海天元化工厂生产漂白粉，当时曾恶毒地封锁了耐酸陶瓷设备的进口。顾浩元的这个创举，对于当时的化学工业的发展，该是多么重要的一个贡献！可是，在剥削阶级统治的社会里，谁又看得起这个“黄泥坯子”“臭窑工”呢？资本家把耐酸陶瓷当作发财致富的奇货，看看有机会赚钱的时候，便叫顾浩元做口窑，不需要的时候，就对他说：“你老了，家里的担子也重，另找活路去吧。”耐酸陶瓷——我国陶瓷工业闪烁的第一个火花，就这样无声无息的熄灭了。
    顾浩元从十四岁那年当学徒起，到1949年解放前，整整在黄泥里滚了三十五年，饱经了人世的沧桑，妻子、儿女接二连三的饿倒了，病死了，房子也失火烧了，天灾人祸和资本家的剥削，把他卷进了贫困和苦难的深渊。
    悲惨的生活，一代一代摧残着人的智慧和精力，谁还有心思去创造什么？陶都，那些漫山斜坡上的古老的龙窑，冒了二千四百年的青烟，还只能烧出些简单的坛坛罐罐。有着悠久历史传统的紫砂工艺，虽然也曾在明朝和清朝有过盛时，开过鲜艳的花朵，但是到了国民党统治的年代，也渐渐雕零了，到解放前夕，已经是奄奄一息了。当时，陶都曾流传着这样一首歌谣：
    窑上青草密如麻，
    泥灰堆上长棉花，
    瓜藤缠满窑头树，
    荆棘丛中啼乌鸦。
    凄凉之状，可以想见！
    1949年，陶都解放了。新中国就像一枝临空而降的大彩笔，一下就抹掉了陶都悲惨的历史。世世代代被剥削得丧失了生活信心的陶瓷工人抬起头来了，流落在异乡的工人回来了，龙窑又喷云吐雾了，用耐酸陶瓷做化工设备，这朵熄灭了的火花又点燃起来了。
    顾浩元带着他的儿子，又开始做活了。
    豪迈的意志终于战胜了一切困难。1950年10月1日，当祖国第二次国庆的礼炮声在天安门城楼上回荡的时候，祖国第一台自己制造的耐酸陶瓷鼓风机也在上海天元化工厂诞生了。鼓风机的风叶唱起了清脆悦耳的歌声，它歌唱祖国的青春，也歌唱陶瓷工业的青春。
    有了一个好的开端，前面的路就广阔得多了。从1951年到1956年，顾浩元父子又接二连三地创造了更多的化工陶瓷设备，一个比一个更复杂，一个比一个更精密。耐酸陶瓷离心分离机、耐酸陶瓷汤轮泵、耐酸陶瓷液环气泵等等，许多本来依靠国外进口的产品，一件件都在他们的手里造出来了，有一些已经达到国际水平。
    仅仅是五、六年的时间呀！在党的领导下，勤劳的人们就把我国的陶瓷工业推上了一个崭新的时期。
    随着祖国化学工业的发展，需要大量的陶瓷设备，来代替钢铁和贵重的合金。根据就地取材的方针，国家决定在盛产陶土的丁蜀镇投资，新建一座近代化的化工陶瓷厂，上海天元化工厂的陶瓷部也搬到了丁蜀镇的新厂里来。顾浩元和他的已经成长起来的儿子，又重新回到了自己的家乡，父子两代当年离开丁蜀镇的时候，是被旧社会所歧视的“臭窑工”，现在他们已经是光荣的共产党员，而且在这个现代化的化工陶瓷厂里分别担任了副厂长的领导职务。他们从此开始了建设现代化陶瓷工业的新路程。
    经过短短一年的经营，现在，这个厂已经有一千二百多工人。这些工人中有70％是一年前刚进厂的新手，原来从上海迁来的工人现在都成了车间的技术骨干。他们正在想尽一切办法使这些新手很快地掌握技术。顾浩元父子两个虽然做了厂长，人们还是天天在车间里看到他们。哪里有困难，他们就亲自去解决；哪里有新的成就，他们也热心地参加研究。顾浩元特别关心对新工人的培养。他们都很明白，陶都的日新月异的建设，多么需要年青人迅速地成长起来啊！
    如今，整个丁蜀镇除了化工陶瓷厂专门生产化工设备外，还有两个陶瓷厂也开始生产了一部分化工陶瓷。这三个厂的产品，已经不单是用在化学工业上，而且被广泛地用在石油、冶炼、造纸、制药、印染、食品等二十一个工业部门。1956年，全镇的化工设备产量只有二百四十多立方米，到1959年上半年，产量已经增加到十三万立方米。产品供应了全国二十四个省、市工业建设的需要，可是仍然供不应求。旧的订货没有交出来，新的订货又接踵而来；老的产品还在生产，新产品的图纸又送到厂里来了。陶都啊！祖国是多么需要你！
    顾浩元父子两代悲欢离合的历史，不正是化工陶瓷工业衰亡兴盛的历史吗？不正是我们时代变迁的一个小小缩影吗？
    化工陶瓷厂的诞生，成了我国陶瓷工业向高级精密和现代化方向发展的里程碑。也成了整个陶都的心脏。它像朝霞一样，放射着生命的光芒，它的光芒照亮了陶都的每一个角落，照亮了每一个陶都的工人的心。老一辈人坚守着自己的岗位；新一代的年青人更加勇敢，更加大胆。去年7月，当中央轻工业部提出了
  “以陶代钢”的号召以后，陶瓷化工厂又一马当先，用它先进的技术，带动了全镇十二个陶瓷工厂又卷进了一场技术革命的浪潮。
    朝阳升起来了，你看，陶都的一切都被朝霞的光辉映得绚烂夺目，生气勃勃。它已经抹去了二千多年的尘埃和灰烬，重新露出了少女般绯红的脸颊。
    古老而年青的陶都啊！在伟大的社会主义建设中，愿你青春长在，大步前进。（附图片）
