Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 1st: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party today issued a statement expressing its opinions on the Indonesian government's recent economic measures and the Indonesian economic situation.

The Indonesian Communist Party believes that the positive significance of devaluing large denomination banknotes and freezing some bank deposits lies in the reduction of currency in circulation and the blow to foreign and Indonesian big capitalists and their floating capital. In this way, the Indonesian government may be able to obtain billions of funds from the frozen bank deposits to build Indonesia and provide good opportunities to strengthen some of the national economic sectors.

However, the Indonesian Communist Party pointed out that if further measures are not taken to fully supply daily necessities, the rising commodity prices cannot be suppressed. The statement said that the current lack of commodity supply is a serious shortcoming that the government must immediately overcome.

The statement also pointed out that many working people and their organizations have been affected by the government's adoption of these new measures.

The Indonesian Communist Party said that most people hope that the next step taken by the government will be to strictly control prices, so that the people can enjoy real and concrete benefits—lower prices. At the same time, the government should control imports and exports and the supply of goods on the market. The Indonesian Communist Party pointed out that the most urgent task at present is to make daily necessities available on the market so that people can buy them at low prices. The method is for the government to distribute them and to prevent production from falling and workers from being laid off, eliminate speculative prices in the free market, and increase food production, etc.

The statement hopes that the government will correctly use the frozen bank deposits in the country's construction projects and increase industrial and agricultural production, and appropriately provide loans to some enterprises (these enterprises must obtain loans because their bank deposits have been frozen); however, no loans should be given to foreign capital with transfer rights.

The statement believes that after the exchange rate between the Indonesian Rupiah and the US dollar has been lowered, commodity prices have become much more expensive. If certain decisive measures are taken, prices will drop to a certain extent. The Indonesian Communist Party also expressed its views on how to ensure the smooth progress of foreign trade. It believes that Indonesia should reduce its economic dependence on the capitalist world market. Domestically, smuggling and illegal trade activities by military personnel and civilians must be stopped. At the same time, efforts must be made to restore public security and adjust state-owned import and export companies.

    印度尼西亚共产党发表声明
    建议政府继续稳定经济
    新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局今天发表了声明，就印度尼西亚政府最近采取的经济措施和印度尼西亚经济问题表示它的意见。
    印度尼西亚共产党认为，大额钞票贬值和把一部分银行存款冻结的积极意义在于使流通的货币已经减少，外国和印度尼西亚大资本家以及他们的游资受到了打击。这样，印度尼西亚政府就可能从已经被冻结的银行存款中得到大约数十亿资金来建设印度尼西亚和提供良好机会来加强国家的一些经济部门。
    但是印度尼西亚共产党指出，如果不采取进一步措施来充分地供应日用必需品，日益上涨的商品价格就不可能压下来。声明说，目前商品供应缺乏是政府必须立刻克服的严重缺点。
    声明还指出，许多劳动人民和他们的组织由于政府采用这些新的措施而受到了打击。
    印度尼西亚共产党说，大多数人民希望政府采取的下一步骤就是严格地控制物价，以便使得人民能够享受到真正具体的好处——物价降低。同时，政府应当控制进出口和市场的商品供应。印度尼西亚共产党指出，目前最迫切的是，使市场上有日用必需品，使人民能够以低廉的价格购买到它们，办法是，由政府进行分配，并且要防止生产降低和解雇工人，消除自由市场的投机价格和增加食品生产等等。
    声明希望政府把已经冻结的银行存款正确地用在这个国家的建设工程和增加工农业生产方面，适当地给一些企业以贷款（这些企业由于它们的银行存款已经冻结，因此必须得到贷款）；但是，不给有转移权的外国资本以贷款。
    声明认为在印度尼西亚盾和美元之间的比值降低以后，商品价格就贵得多了。如果采取某种断然措施的话，价格就会降低到一定的程度。印度尼西亚共产党还就如何使对外贸易顺利进行表示了它的意见。它认为印度尼西亚应当减少它在经济上依靠资本主义世界市场的程度。在国内，必须制止军人和平民的走私和非法的贸易活动，同时，必须作出努力来恢复公共安全，对国营进出口公司进行调整。
