Editorial:

    The Soviet government, on September 14, issued another statement on the Laotian situation, accusing the United Nations Security Council's recent decision to dispatch a "investigation" subcommittee to Laos of clearly violating the United Nations Charter and the Geneva Agreements on Laos. The Soviet government proposed that the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina immediately hold an international conference to discuss pressing issues such as normalizing the situation in Laos. This is a significant and timely proposal from the Soviet Union, as one of the co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, to eliminate the current tense situation in Laos.
    The Chinese people resolutely support this significant proposal from the Soviet government. Our government issued a statement on September 15, pointing out that convening such a conference is urgently needed to ease the Laotian situation. The Chinese government firmly believes that the Geneva Conference, which once restored peace in the Indochina region, will certainly play its due role once again in promoting the normalization of the Laotian situation. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also issued a statement on the 16th, welcoming the Soviet government's proposal and expressing its readiness to contribute to the conference proposed by the Soviet government. The propositions of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully demonstrate the sincere desire and unremitting efforts of the three governments to ease international tensions.
    The Geneva Agreements were reached through consultations among the countries concerned in order to guarantee peace in Laos and Indochina; and the disruption of peace in Laos is precisely due to the sabotage of this agreement by the United States and the Laotian Sananikone group, which provoked a civil war. Now, the United States' further usurpation of the United Nations' name to interfere in Laotian internal affairs means a complete tearing up of the Geneva Agreements. This illegal act, as pointed out by the Soviet government in its statement, harbors extremely serious consequences.
    Facts have proven that the excuse created by the United States and the Sananikone group for United Nations intervention, namely the slanderous accusation of armed forces from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "invading," has long been shamefully bankrupt. Look at how these liars from the United States and the Laotian authorities fabricate rumors and then slap themselves in the face. At a press conference held on September 1, Laotian Foreign Minister Phoui Sananikone told reporters that the clear evidence of "Viet Minh direct interference" was that the Laotian authorities had "captured" some Viet Minh "prisoners." He also promised to "let the press see these prisoners in a few days." However, eleven days later, while busy fabricating "evidence" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's "aggression" for the United Nations "investigation team," Anka Soukhavong, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Royal Laotian Army, inadvertently admitted that "the biggest problem" was that "there is not a single Viet Minh prisoner of war," hoping to "catch one soon"! You see, the basis of the accusation was originally "Viet Minh prisoners of war," but now they admit that "there is not a single Viet Minh prisoner of war." How absurd is this! Facts prove that the so-called "aggression" of Laos by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a complete and utter lie. The United States and the Sananikone government fabricated this lie in order to provide an excuse for the United States' direct armed intervention in Laos. And the United States' directing the Security Council to dispatch an "investigation" team to Laos is nothing more than affixing a United Nations label to the United States' armed intervention. Recently, the number of American military personnel in Laos has increased sharply, and American military supplies are steadily being shipped to Laos. The recent war cries issued by some US Air Force generals on the Laotian situation and the tense military meetings held by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, preparing to immediately use the armed forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states, primarily the armed forces of the United States, are certainly not accidental.
    Due to the United States' intensified interference in Laos, the Laotian situation harbors even more serious consequences than now, and the Laotian civil war risks further expansion. The US aggressive forces have chosen to intensify the tense situation in Laos at a time when the overall international situation is trending towards relaxation. One of their goals is clearly to poison the international atmosphere.
    The Chinese government has consistently advocated strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and advocated resolving the Laotian issue through the relevant international institutions established under this agreement. In order to promote the early resolution of the Laotian issue, the Chinese government has suggested to the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet and British governments, as well as to the Indian government, the chairman of the International Control Commission, to quickly restore the activities of the International Control Commission. In its September 15 statement, the Chinese government fully supported the Soviet government's proposal and believed that the proposed international conference should listen to the report and recommendations of the Laotian International Control Commission. We believe that all countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference have a solemn responsibility to uphold the Geneva Agreements and peace in Indochina, and at this important moment, they must not evade their international obligations. Striving to hold a meeting of all participating countries of the Geneva Conference as soon as possible and quickly eliminate the tense situation in Laos is the current urgent task of all peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world.

### 迅速重开日内瓦会议

    迅速重开日内瓦会议
    苏联政府在9月14日就老挝局势再一次发表声明，指责不久前联合国安全理事会决定派遣“调查”小组委员会到老挝去是明显地破坏了联合国宪章和关于老挝的日内瓦协议。苏联政府建议参加1954年有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的国家立即举行国际会议，讨论使老挝局势正常化等迫切问题。这是作为日内瓦会议主席之一的苏联，为了消除当前老挝紧张局势的一个重大而适时的建议。
    中国人民坚决支持苏联政府的这一重大的建议。我国政府在9月15日发表声明指出，为了和缓老挝局势，召开这种会议已经刻不容缓了。中国政府深信：曾经恢复了印度支那地区和平的日内瓦会议一定能够再一次起到促使老挝局势正常化的应有作用。越南民主共和国政府16日也发表声明，欢迎苏联政府的建议，并表示随时准备为苏联政府所建议召开的会议作出贡献。苏联、中国和越南民主共和国的主张，充分地表现了三国政府对于缓和国际紧张局势的真诚意愿和不懈的努力。
    日内瓦协议是为了保障老挝和印度支那的和平而经有关各国协商达成的；而老挝和平的遭到破坏，正是由于美国和老挝萨纳尼空集团破坏了这个协议，挑起了内战。现在美国进一步盗用联合国名义干涉老挝内政的活动，意味着彻底撕毁日内瓦协议。这一非法行为，正如苏联政府在声明中所指出的，包藏着极其严重的后果。
    事实证明，美国和萨纳尼空集团为联合国干涉所制造的借口，即所谓越南民主共和国武装部队“侵略”的诬告，早已可耻地破产了。请看这些美国和老挝当局的撒谎家们是怎样造谣，而又怎样自打嘴巴的吧。老挝外交大臣班雅在9月1日举行的记者招待会上向记者们说，“越盟直接进行干涉”的明证是老挝当局“俘获”的一些越盟“俘虏”。他并且还答应“在几天内让报界看看这些俘虏。”可是时隔十一天，老挝王国军队副参谋长安卡·苏卡冯在忙于为联合国“调查团”捏造越南民主共和国“侵略”的“证据”时，无意之中却承认，“最大的问题”是“没有一个越盟战俘”，希望“不久抓到一个”！你看，原来控告的根据是“越盟战俘”，而现在却承认“没有一个越盟战俘”，这是多么荒唐的事情呵！事实证明，所谓越南民主共和国“侵略”老挝，是彻头彻尾的谎言。美国和萨纳尼空政府制造这个谎言，目的是为美国的直接武装干涉老挝提供借口。而美国指挥安理会派遣“调查”小组到老挝去，无非是为美国的武装干涉贴上联合国的商标而已。最近在老挝的美国军事人员剧增，美国军事物资正源源运到老挝去。这几天来美国一些海空军将军们就老挝局势发出的一片战争叫嚣和东南亚条约组织举行紧张的军事会议，准备立即使用东南亚条约组织参加国的武装部队，首先是美国的武装部队，当然不是偶然的。
    由于美国加紧对老挝的干涉活动，老挝局势潜伏着比现在更加严重的后果，老挝内战有进一步扩大化的危险。美国侵略势力选择在目前整个国际形势趋向缓和的时刻，竭力加剧老挝的紧张局势，其目的之一，显然是为了毒化国际气氛。
    中国政府一贯主张严格履行日内瓦协议及主张通过根据这个协议而成立的有关的国际机构来解决老挝问题。中国政府为了促使老挝问题的早日解决，曾经向日内瓦会议两主席苏联和英国政府以及向老挝国际委员会主席印度政府建议，迅速恢复国际委员会的活动。在9月15日的声明中，中国政府完全支持苏联政府的建议，并且认为拟议中的国际会议应该听取老挝国际委员会的报告和建议。我们认为，所有参加1954年日内瓦会议的国家对于维护日内瓦协议和印度支那的和平都负有庄严的责任，在这个重要的时刻更不能回避自己所承担的国际义务。争取早日举行所有日内瓦会议的参加国的会议，迅速消除老挝的紧张局势，是亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民当前的紧迫的任务。
