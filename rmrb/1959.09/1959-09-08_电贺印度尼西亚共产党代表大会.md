    Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Sends Telegram of Congratulations to the Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia
    Wishing the Communist Party of Indonesia new achievements in strengthening party unity, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthening the unity of patriotic and democratic forces.
    Wishing the Indonesian people greater victories in the struggle to consolidate national independence, defend democratic freedoms, strive for social progress, and oppose colonialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to congratulate the Communist Party of Indonesia on the convening of its Sixth National Congress. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:
To the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia,
Dear Comrades Delegates:
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends warm, fraternal congratulations to the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and all the Chinese people.

    The Communist Party of Indonesia has experienced a long, tortuous, and glorious path of struggle. Since its establishment, it has always stood at the forefront of the opposition to Dutch colonial rule, waging an unyielding struggle for the national independence, democratic freedom, and social progress of Indonesia.

    After Indonesia declared its independence, the Communist Party of Indonesia, together with the Indonesian people, made unremitting efforts and brilliant contributions to consolidating Indonesia's national independence, safeguarding the people's democratic freedoms, and defending world peace. In the recent period, American imperialism has continuously and rudely interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs, supported Dutch imperialism in continuing to occupy Indonesia's legitimate territory of West Irian, provoked and divided Indonesian national unity, and plotted and supported rebel groups in subversive conspiracies against the Indonesian government. It attempts to replace the position of the former Dutch colonial rulers and wants to drag Indonesia into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. All of this shows that American imperialism is not only the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, but also the most dangerous enemy of the Indonesian people. The Communist Party of Indonesia is doing its utmost to unite all patriotic and democratic forces, to continue to eliminate Dutch imperialist forces, resolutely oppose American infiltration and subversive activities, and to defend Indonesia's democratic freedoms, thereby winning the growing prestige and trust among the Indonesian people. The long history of struggle proves that the Communist Party of Indonesia is the most faithful representative and defender of Indonesia's national independence and the interests of the Indonesian working people.

    Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade D.N. Aidit, the Communist Party of Indonesia has made many efforts and achieved remarkable successes in consolidating and strengthening the ranks of the Communist Party of Indonesia, in closely linking the Party with the Indonesian masses, and in strengthening the unity of Marxist-Leninist thought within the Party. All of this is precisely the source of the continuous development and growth of the Communist Party of Indonesia as an important factor in national unity.

    The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are pleased with all the achievements made by the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people in their struggles. We congratulate the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia on its complete success, and wish the Communist Party of Indonesia new achievements in strengthening party unity, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthening the unity of all patriotic and democratic forces. We wish the Indonesian people greater victories in the struggle to consolidate national independence, defend democratic freedoms, strive for social progress, oppose colonialism, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

                                Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                                                September 4, 1959

    中国共产党中央委员会
    电贺印度尼西亚共产党代表大会
    祝印度尼西亚共产党在增强党的团结、巩固工农联盟和加强爱国民主力量团结的事业上获得新的成就
    祝印度尼西亚人民在巩固民族独立、保卫民主自由、争取社会进步、反对殖民主义的斗争中获得更大胜利
    新华社7日讯　中国共产党中央委员会打电报祝贺印度尼西亚共产党召开第六次代表大会。贺电全文如下：印度尼西亚共产党第六次代表大会亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和中国全体人民，向印度尼西亚共产党第六次代表大会表示热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    印度尼西亚共产党经历了长期的、曲折的和光荣的斗争道路。它自从成立以来，就始终站在反对荷兰殖民主义统治的最前列，为着争取印度尼西亚的民族独立、民主自由和社会进步而进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    在印度尼西亚宣布独立以后，印度尼西亚共产党同印度尼西亚人民一道，为巩固印度尼西亚的民族独立、维护人民的民主自由和保卫世界和平而进行了不懈的努力，并作出了辉煌的贡献。最近一个时期，美国帝国主义不断粗暴地干涉印度尼西亚内政，支持荷兰帝国主义继续占领印度尼西亚的合法领土西伊里安，挑拨和分裂印度尼西亚的民族团结，策动和支持叛乱集团进行颠覆印度尼西亚政府的阴谋活动，它企图代替前荷兰殖民主义统治者的地位，并想把印度尼西亚拉入东南亚条约组织。这一切说明，美国帝国主义不仅是世界人民的最凶恶的敌人，而且也是印度尼西亚人民的最危险的敌人。印度尼西亚共产党正在竭尽全力，团结一切爱国民主力量，为继续肃清荷兰帝国主义势力，坚决反对美国的渗入和颠覆活动，并为保卫印度尼西亚的民主自由，进行着英勇的斗争，从而在印度尼西亚人民中赢得日益增长的威望和信任。长期的斗争历史证明，印度尼西亚共产党是印度尼西亚民族独立和印度尼西亚劳动人民利益的最忠实的代表者和捍卫者。
    印度尼西亚共产党在以迪·努·艾地同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，在巩固和壮大印度尼西亚共产党的队伍方面，在密切党同印度尼西亚人民群众的联系方面，在加强党内马克思列宁主义思想的统一方面，都进行了许多努力，取得了显著的成就。这一切正是印度尼西亚共产党作为民族团结的重大因素而不断发展壮大的源泉。
    中国共产党和中国人民对于印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民在自己的斗争中所取得的一切成就感到高兴。我们祝贺印度尼西亚共产党第六次代表大会圆满成功，祝印度尼西亚共产党在增强党的团结、巩固工农联盟和加强一切爱国民主力量的团结的事业上获得新的成就。祝印度尼西亚人民在巩固民族独立、保卫民主自由和争取社会进步、反对殖民主义和维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
                                中国共产党中央委员会
                                                1959年9月4日
