Shandong, Guangdong, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia

Grasp Autumn Field Management and Strive for Increased Production

This newspaper reports: The people's communes in Shandong, Guangdong, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia are vigorously grasping field management of autumn harvest crops, determined to complete and exceed agricultural production plans.

The early autumn harvest in Shandong has greatly encouraged millions of commune members to strengthen late autumn management and strive for a bumper harvest. Leaders in many regions have gone deep into the fields to set up camp. The drought resistance and autumn protection army in Gaomi County is both fighting drought and managing cotton fields. In Heze County, 170,000 mu of fields were affected by autumn locusts. The entire county mobilized 200,000 people twice: one day of intense battle and one day of mopping up the remnants, which not only eliminated the locusts but also controlled the bean weevil in more than 90,000 mu of soybeans. In autumn field management, all regions paid special attention to breaking the "fixed outcome theory," managing to the end, and strengthening the management of sweet potatoes, soybeans, and autumn vegetables. Regarding the management of late sweet potatoes, all regions generally require one jin of fertilizer, ten jin of water (in arid areas), and two spadefuls of soil per plant.

Guangdong Province's rural areas are universally launching a high tide of production to oppose Right-leaning ideas, boost morale, and vigorously grasp autumn field management to strive for high yields of late rice. The broad masses of cadres and commune members are light-footed, full of joy, and extremely enthusiastic. Now, the number of people attending work in the rural areas of various counties has greatly increased, the progress of inter-tillage has accelerated, and work efficiency has significantly improved. The province has invested 5.21 million laborers in autumn inter-tillage and 3.1 million in manure collection. The average daily inter-tillage efficiency per person has increased by an average of one time. The daily progress of inter-tillage in the province has reached 4.45 million mu. Some areas have already launched a second high tide of inter-tillage and topdressing after universal inter-tillage and topdressing. Therefore, the rice seedlings throughout the province are growing vigorously and tillering quickly.

The more than 400 people's communes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region resolutely implement the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, vowing to win a great bumper harvest of autumn crops. A vigorous high tide of late-stage autumn field management has widely formed north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In Kashgar Prefecture south of the Tianshan Mountains, autumn crops are growing particularly well this year. At present, most of the more than 700,000 mu of cotton has produced about 20 bolls per plant. Early-sown corn has grown to nearly two meters tall. Rice, millet, and other crops are also very robust. Recently, the counties under this prefecture have launched a mass autumn field inspection and field consultation. In Yecheng County, the 70 production teams of the county's nine communes universally classified the autumn crops, implemented file management, and adopted measures according to local conditions. In Hami Prefecture east of the Tianshan Mountains, late-stage autumn field management has also been in full swing recently. Hami County recently invested 50% of the county's agricultural labor force in autumn field management. After more than ten days of hard work by these commune members, the three types of seedlings throughout the county have generally improved. In the Ili and Changji Hui Autonomous Prefectures in northern Xinjiang, the weather is colder and there are few summer-sown crops. At present, some of the rice, corn, sorghum, millet, and other crops in these areas are filling, and some are about to mature. The people's communes in these areas are organizing commune members to give the autumn crops a final boost.

A new high tide of agricultural production centered on strengthening autumn field overproduction management, accumulating fertilizer and manufacturing fertilizer has emerged in the vast rural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The high-spirited farmers of all ethnic groups are sounding the war drums of "working hard for one hundred days," determined to complete and exceed agricultural production plans. After opposing Right-leaning ideas and boosting morale, communes in various regions have greatly strengthened weeding, topdressing, and other autumn field management measures. Generally, autumn fields have been weeded and topdressed one or two times recently, so that some backward seedlings have quickly caught up with advanced seedlings. In Zhaowuda League, the autumn fields that have been weeded once in the entire league have reached more than 11.96 million mu. While strengthening autumn field management, all regions vigorously carried out green manure, summer plowing, and fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing. (Attached picture)

    山东·广东·新疆·内蒙古
    大抓秋田管理力争超产
    本报讯　山东、广东、新疆、内蒙古各地人民公社正大抓秋收作物田间管理，决心完成和超额完成农业增产计划。
    山东各地早秋丰收大大鼓舞了千百万社员加强晚秋管理，争取晚秋丰收的干劲。许多地区的领导干部都已深入田间，安营扎寨。高密县的抗旱保秋大军，一面抗旱一面进行棉田管理。菏泽县有十七万亩
  田发生秋蝗，全县两天出动二十万人次，一天大战，一天扫荡残余，既消灭了蝗虫，又兼治了九万多亩大豆的造桥虫。在秋田管理中，各地特别注意了打破“定局论”，一管到底，加强了对甘薯、大豆和秋菜的管理。关于晚甘薯的管理，各地普遍要求每棵一斤肥、十斤水（旱区）和两锨土。
    广东省农村正普遍展开反右倾，鼓干劲，大抓秋田管理，争取晚稻高产的生产高潮。广大干部和人民公社的社员身轻脚快，喜气洋洋，跃进的劲头极为高涨。现在，各县农村出勤人数大大增加，中耕进度加快，工效显著提高了。全省投入秋田中耕的劳动力已达五百二十一万人，投入积肥的已达三百一十万人。每人每日中耕工效平均增加了一倍，全省中耕日进度已达四百四十五万亩，有些地区已经在普遍中耕追肥之后掀起了第二次中耕追肥高潮。因此，全省禾苗生势很旺，分蘖很快。
    新疆维吾尔自治区四百多个人民公社，坚决贯彻执行党的八届八中全会的决议，誓夺秋田作物大丰收，一个轰轰烈烈的秋田后期管理高潮，已在天山南北广泛形成。天山以南的喀什专区，今年秋季作物长的特别好，目前七十多万亩棉花，绝大部分棉株已结桃二十个左右，早播玉米已长到近两米左右高，水稻、糜子等也很茁壮，最近这个专区的所属各县，曾展开了一次群众性的秋田大检查和田间会诊。叶城县全县九个公社的七十个生产队，普遍把秋田作物进行了分级排队，实行了档案管理，因地制宜采取措施。天山以东的哈密地区，最近秋田后期管理也搞的热火朝天。哈密县最近投入秋田管理的劳动力占到全县农业劳动力的50％，经过这些社员十多天的苦战，全县的三类苗已普遍好转。新疆北部的伊犁和昌吉回族自治州一带，天气较冷，夏播作物很少，目前这些地区的水稻、玉米、高粱、糜子、谷子等有的正在灌浆，有的已即将成熟，这些地区的各人民公社正在组织社员为秋季作物加最后一把劲。
    一个以加强秋田超产管理、积肥造肥为中心的农业生产新高潮，已在内蒙古自治区广大农村出现。斗志昂扬的各族农民，正响起“大干特干一百天”的战鼓，决心完成和超额完成农业增产计划。经过反右倾和鼓干劲，各地公社大大加强了锄草、追肥等秋田管理措施。一般秋田最近都锄草、追肥一两遍，使一些落后苗迅速赶上了先进苗。昭乌达盟全盟锄过一遍的秋田，已达一千一百九十六万多亩。在加强秋田管理的同时，各地大力进行了压青、夏翻和积肥造肥。（附图片）
