Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd: Hanoi newspapers today published an article by Premier Pham Van Dong to celebrate the fourteenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The article states, "North Vietnam in 1959 will achieve greater progress than in the past."

In his article entitled "Enhance Fighting Spirit, Determined to Complete the Year's National Plan," Premier Pham Van Dong said that this year, there have been new achievements and progress in economic, cultural, and other fields; preliminary achievements have also been made in science and technology. He wrote: "On the socialist transformation front, we are vigorously promoting the rural cooperative movement with a tense, active, steady, and prudent spirit, closely combining agricultural production with the organization of farmers. We are gradually leading handicraftsmen and small merchants into various cooperative organizations. Recently, we have begun to expand the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce." The article pointed out that the resolution of the Sixteenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party has promoted the socialist revolution in North Vietnam and promoted the socialist transformation movement.

Regarding some existing problems in the current implementation of the national plan, the article said that attention must first be paid to comprehensiveness and balance, while grasping the main links and key points. The article pointed out: "The experience and lessons learned from implementing the plan in the first half of the year require us to immediately consider the measures to achieve the targets whenever we set numerical targets. This is to strengthen our fighting will and strengthen our determination to achieve the plan."

The article emphasized the importance of continuously strengthening the socialist ideological education of cadres and strengthening the leadership of the Party and improving state institutions. The article stated: "Strengthening the leadership of the Party means strengthening the leadership of Party committees and branches at all levels, in all departments, and at the grassroots level, and realizing the collective, centralized, and unified leadership of Party committees at all levels. Collective leadership is the highest principle of the Party, and this principle must be implemented in parallel with the system of division of labor and individual responsibility."

Speaking of the prospects for the Five-Year Plan, the article said that Vietnam is preparing to formulate a national five-year plan. The implementation of the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) will lay the foundation for the Five-Year Plan. The article said that the implementation of the future Five-Year Plan will initially change the entire face of North Vietnam and all aspects of life.

The article said: "We will increase the average yield of rice per hectare to three tons, four tons, or even five tons. We will adopt advanced technology to develop cash crops on a large scale and at high speed. We will completely harness the Red River. The ideal of the Northern people for thousands of years and the folk tale of 'Mountain God defeating Water God' will be realized by us with science and technology."

The article continued: During the Five-Year Plan period, North Vietnam will further develop industry and vigorously build various urgently needed heavy industries: electricity, machinery, metallurgy, chemicals, and building materials. At the same time, we will further develop light industry and the food industry. New economic zones will gradually appear in the plains, mountains, and western and eastern regions. The lives of the Vietnamese people will be continuously improved. A new society will gradually take shape, and new people and new things will gradually increase.

The article pointed out: "This beautiful prospect can already be foreseen and can certainly be created by our own hands." The article called on the people of North Vietnam to strive for the realization of this beautiful vision.

    范文同总理为庆祝越南国庆发表文章
    增强斗志决心完成今年国家计划
    新华社河内2日电　河内各报今天刊登的范文同总理为庆祝越南民主共和国建国十四周年而发表的文章说：“越南北方在1959年要比过去获得更大的进展。”
    范文同总理在他的题为“增强斗志，决心完成今年国家计划”的文章中说，今年，在经济文化等方面都有新的成绩和进步；在科学技术方面，也取得了初步的成就。他写道：“在社会主义改造战线上，我们正以紧张、积极而又稳健、慎重的精神大力推进农村的合作化运动，使农业生产和把农民组织起来的工作紧密结合起来；我们逐步领导手工业者和小商贩组成各种合作组织，最近，我们开始扩大对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造”。文章指出，越南劳动党中央委员会第十六次会议的决议推进了越南北方社会主义革命和促进社会主义改造运动。
    文章谈到当前实现国家计划工作中存在的一些问题时说，首先必须注意全面和平衡，同时要掌握主要环节和重点。文章指出：“执行上半年计划的经验教训要求我们每当订出数字指标的时候，就必须立即考虑到实现指标的措施，这是为了加强我们的奋斗意志，加强实现计划的决心。”
    文章强调必须不断加强对干部的社会主义思想教育和加强党的领导、健全国家机构的重要性。文章说：“加强党的领导就是加强在各级、各部门和基层组织的党委和支部的领导，就是实现各级党委集体、集中和统一的领导。集体领导是党的最高原则，这个原则必须与分工和个人负责的制度并行。”
    文章谈到五年计划的远景时说，越南正在为拟订国家五年计划作准备。实现三年计划（1958—1960），将为五年计划打下基础。文章说，实现未来的五年计划，将初步改变北越的整个面貌和各方面的生活。
    文章说：“我们将使平均每公顷水稻的产量提高到三吨、四吨以至五吨。我们将采用先进技术大规模地、高速度地发展经济作物。我们将根治红河。北方人民千百年来的理想和民间流传的‘山精战胜水精’的神话，我们将以科学技术来实现它。”
    文章接着说：在五年计划期间，北越将进一步发展工业，大力建设各种迫切需要的重工业：电力、机械、冶金、化学、建筑材料。同时，进一步发展轻工业和食品工业。新的经济区域将逐渐地在平原、山区、西面和东面地区出现。越南人民的生活将得到不断的提高。新社会将逐渐形成、新人新事也将逐渐增加。
    文章指出：“这种美好的前景目前已经可以预见，并且一定能够用我们的双手创造它。”文章号召北越人民为实现这种美好的远景而努力奋斗。
