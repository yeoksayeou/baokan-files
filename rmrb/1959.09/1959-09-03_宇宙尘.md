    Cosmic Dust
    The Earth's atmosphere contains 28.6 million tons of cosmic dust in a suspended state. It is composed of extremely fine meteorite particles that gradually fall to Earth. Scientists believe that 14.3 million tons of this dust falls to the ground as sediment each year, so that all cosmic dust is completely renewed within two years. The analysis of air at various altitudes, after passing them through microporous filters, proves that this dust is composed of iron, nickel, and cobalt, with nickel accounting for the majority of the weight.

    宇宙尘
    在地球大气中含有处于悬浮状态的宇宙起源尘二千八百六十万吨。它是由逐渐降落到地球上的极细小的陨石微粒构成的。科学家认为，一年内有一千四百三十万吨这种尘埃以沉淀物状态降落到地面上，因此，在两年内，全部宇宙尘就完全更新了。通过各种不同高度的空气分析，使它们穿过具有微孔的过滤器后证明：这种尘埃是由铁、镍、钴构成的，而其中占主要重量的是镍。（云译自“科学与生活”）
